WEBVTT

00:00.267 --> 00:01.986
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:02.027 --> 00:04.261
He took me out to the church's camp.

00:04.296 --> 00:07.430
He said he was just going
to teach me how to fish.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.299
You need to stay out of my way.

00:09.334 --> 00:11.234
- I mean it.
- Get out of my office now.

00:11.270 --> 00:13.202
You start pulling threads
to get to me, girl,

00:13.237 --> 00:14.570
you're going to unravel the whole thing.

00:14.605 --> 00:16.938
What exactly did the auditor say?

00:16.974 --> 00:19.107
She wants our personal income taxes,

00:19.143 --> 00:21.177
complete with receipts,
for the last three years.

00:21.212 --> 00:22.611
When were you going to tell me?

00:22.647 --> 00:24.246
After they put me in prison?

00:24.282 --> 00:25.658
I should go.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.584
Sometimes I wonder if he isn't still

00:28.619 --> 00:30.017
holding a torch for Grace.

00:30.053 --> 00:32.520
Well, pardon my lapse
of loyalty, but no.

00:33.237 --> 00:35.456
After a thorough investigation

00:35.492 --> 00:37.925
into the fatal shooting of
16-year-old Kenneth Collins,

00:38.249 --> 00:41.562
the grand jury has declined
to bring criminal charges...

00:41.598 --> 00:43.531
- Like I said.
- This is a surprise.

00:43.567 --> 00:45.900
I thought you'd be halfway
to Delaware by now.

00:45.935 --> 00:46.866
Yeah, well, you got me thinking.

00:47.398 --> 00:50.042
For my brother.

00:50.072 --> 00:51.305
Oh, my God!

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

02:36.972 --> 02:38.606
I've been to a lot of funerals,

02:38.641 --> 02:41.275
but that had to be the most moving take

02:41.311 --> 02:44.111
on John 14 I've ever heard.

02:44.146 --> 02:45.112
Wouldn't you agree, Pastor?

02:45.147 --> 02:46.413
It was very good.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.915
The way the bishop took verse 9

02:48.950 --> 02:52.084
and he just made you really
feel the sorrow of Jesus

02:52.120 --> 02:54.187
and how Philip hadn't
recognized God in him...

02:55.165 --> 02:56.189
I'll be honest,

02:56.224 --> 02:58.925
I didn't know Officer Nelson
well during his time here,

02:58.960 --> 03:01.928
but I really felt
his presence this morning.

03:02.602 --> 03:03.428
I'm going to have to get Bishop

03:03.464 --> 03:05.096
to give me a copy
of that one for my files.

03:05.132 --> 03:07.407
I'm sure he'd be happy
to share it with you.

03:09.447 --> 03:11.102
You knew David pretty well, didn't you?

03:11.138 --> 03:13.939
I wouldn't say well.
Do you know what, Thomas?

03:13.974 --> 03:15.923
I got to get ready for
this deacon board meeting.

03:15.959 --> 03:17.196
At 10:30 in the morning?

03:17.231 --> 03:18.722
It's an emergency.

03:19.479 --> 03:21.245
Pastor, if I was ever able

03:21.280 --> 03:22.980
to overcome my own natural modesty

03:23.015 --> 03:24.415
and put myself up
for the deacon board...

03:24.451 --> 03:26.150
You'd have my vote, Thomas.

03:26.185 --> 03:28.139
I just might do it after all. Thank you.

03:43.017 --> 03:44.600
I mean, I don't know about all of you,

03:44.636 --> 03:46.936
but my phone's been ringing
off the hook since Sunday.

03:46.972 --> 03:49.272
Mine as well, Connie. Mine as well.

03:49.307 --> 03:50.838
With people saying what?

03:50.874 --> 03:52.942
Is it safe to come back to the church?

03:52.978 --> 03:55.745
Are we going to continue to
be targeted by these people?

03:55.780 --> 03:57.278
We weren't targeted.

03:57.615 --> 03:59.118
David Nelson was targeted...

03:59.417 --> 04:00.383
by one man.

04:00.870 --> 04:02.251
But you made a point

04:02.286 --> 04:03.919
of supporting the police, Bishop,

04:03.954 --> 04:05.383
all on your own.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.757
And now, if there's
anyone else out there

04:07.792 --> 04:09.176
still angry about that,

04:09.211 --> 04:11.493
what's to stop them
from loading up a gun

04:11.528 --> 04:13.194
and walking into
the church and shooting...

04:13.229 --> 04:14.561
I agree with Connie.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.713
It's up to Bishop what we do,

04:18.635 --> 04:19.928
but we've got to do something.

04:20.637 --> 04:22.704
I do not want to be
a sanctified sitting duck.

04:22.739 --> 04:24.101
Amen.

04:24.136 --> 04:27.408
I want armed security
patrolling that parking lot.

04:27.443 --> 04:30.744
I want armed security inside
the doors of that tabernacle.

04:30.780 --> 04:32.178
I thought it was up to me, dear.

04:32.214 --> 04:36.249
Well, I'm just making suggestions.

04:36.285 --> 04:38.060
Here's my feeling.

04:38.621 --> 04:41.755
Now, I've prayed about this
fervently for the past few days,

04:41.791 --> 04:44.479
and what the Lord's been
saying to me loud and clear

04:45.391 --> 04:47.426
is this is a time for peace.

04:47.462 --> 04:50.448
Amen. Peace through strength.

04:52.064 --> 04:54.434
I mean, I don't understand
what the problem is.

04:54.469 --> 04:57.269
- You own a gun yourself.
- I know I have one,

04:57.305 --> 04:58.959
but we're talking about
the church here, Mae,

04:59.307 --> 05:01.173
a place where our shield
and our strength,

05:01.208 --> 05:03.241
as you put it, is in the Lord,

05:03.276 --> 05:06.312
not in some two-pound
handful of deadly metal.

05:06.747 --> 05:10.181
Listen, if you think Basie
Skanks is a thorn in your side,

05:10.216 --> 05:12.851
just let one more person
be shot at this church.

05:12.886 --> 05:14.453
Mac, don't you agree?

05:14.488 --> 05:16.755
I think the liability issues are tricky,

05:16.790 --> 05:20.758
but I'm not flat-out opposed
to guns in the church.

05:20.793 --> 05:23.260
The Bible also says
there's a time for war.

05:23.295 --> 05:25.763
- That's right.
- Pastor Greenleaf?

05:25.798 --> 05:27.952
You must have an opinion on this.

05:28.233 --> 05:29.514
Oh, Lord, here we go.

05:30.224 --> 05:31.268
I don't, actually.

05:32.551 --> 05:33.911
I...

05:34.607 --> 05:37.206
- I think it's complicated.
- Brother Kendall?

05:38.098 --> 05:40.742
I have a friend in law
enforcement down in Orlando.

05:40.779 --> 05:42.378
He attends a church out there.

05:42.413 --> 05:43.412
Ever since the murders in Charleston,

05:43.448 --> 05:44.914
he began conducting

05:44.950 --> 05:47.249
self-defense seminars for churches.

05:47.285 --> 05:48.885
How to disarm a gunman.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.253
How to handle a hostage situation.

05:51.289 --> 05:54.923
Now, it may not address
the gun or no gun issue,

05:54.959 --> 05:56.758
but it might make people
safer in the meantime.

05:56.794 --> 05:58.340
Feel safer.

05:58.799 --> 06:00.228
I want to be safer.

06:00.263 --> 06:01.597
Do you think this friend of yours

06:01.632 --> 06:03.365
would come and give us a presentation?

06:03.782 --> 06:04.566
I'll give them a call.

06:05.173 --> 06:05.934
You do that,

06:06.445 --> 06:08.770
and we'll adjourn.

06:08.806 --> 06:10.437
Bishop.

06:12.274 --> 06:15.175
Hey, you got a second?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.724
Sure, sure.

06:18.781 --> 06:20.915
Isabel's mom came into town last night,

06:20.950 --> 06:23.250
so my office is ground zero

06:23.285 --> 06:24.919
for all things wedding related.

06:24.954 --> 06:26.772
As it should be.

06:29.791 --> 06:31.114
Wow.

06:39.096 --> 06:40.433
How you doing?

06:40.468 --> 06:42.176
I'm all right.

06:43.405 --> 06:44.570
I haven't told anyone anything,

06:44.605 --> 06:45.604
if that's what you're wondering.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.606
I'm not, but thanks.

06:48.494 --> 06:49.530
So, what's up?

06:50.411 --> 06:51.911
I just want to ask you,

06:51.946 --> 06:53.412
you have all the evidence you need

06:53.447 --> 06:55.021
to go to the police about Mac, right?

06:55.057 --> 06:55.808
Yeah.

06:56.044 --> 06:57.583
I've been emailing
with Danielle and Vida,

06:57.618 --> 06:59.939
getting them prepared
for their statements, so...

07:00.514 --> 07:03.755
I was just waiting until after
this memorial was over today.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.690
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

07:06.714 --> 07:07.625
Me, too.

07:08.003 --> 07:09.727
It wasn't your fault.

07:10.226 --> 07:12.596
I wasn't uninvolved.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.298
He only came to church because I said...

07:14.333 --> 07:16.434
He came to church because he wanted to.

07:17.668 --> 07:19.269
It wasn't your fault.

07:19.304 --> 07:20.817
Thanks.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.678
I really just want to know
what your timeline is.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.913
Isabel and I have all these
folks pouring into town

07:29.949 --> 07:31.848
for the wedding starting tomorrow.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.383
You want me to wait until after
the wedding to go to the police?

07:33.418 --> 07:35.258
No, I wouldn't ask you to do that.

07:35.687 --> 07:37.107
I just want to prep Izzie

07:37.143 --> 07:39.683
in case you were planning
on doing it today.

07:41.898 --> 07:42.864
Where are you guys honeymooning?

07:45.196 --> 07:46.365
Maui.

07:48.838 --> 07:51.280
That always was your dream, wasn't it,

07:52.469 --> 07:55.203
- Hawaiian honeymoon?
- Yeah, I guess it was.

07:55.238 --> 07:57.371
That's great. Dream's coming true, huh?

07:58.791 --> 08:01.209
Anyway, what's your plan?

08:01.244 --> 08:04.412
- I can hold off.
- I'm not asking you to.

08:04.447 --> 08:06.247
No, no, it's all right.
I waited a whole week.

08:06.282 --> 08:08.749
A few more days are not
going to hurt anything.

08:09.257 --> 08:10.256
Mac's not going anywhere.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.495
Enjoy your wedding.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.093
It's all good.

08:21.092 --> 08:22.796
- Grace?
- Yeah?

08:22.832 --> 08:26.238
- Thank you.
- You got it.

08:32.375 --> 08:35.240
Now, I thought April was
shellfish season down there.

08:35.275 --> 08:36.542
Marlin, too, now and bigeye.

08:36.577 --> 08:39.020
I wish we could come with you.

08:39.576 --> 08:42.653
Ever since Cuba opened up,
we wanted to check it out.

08:55.647 --> 08:57.047
- Morning, Karine.
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.138 --> 09:01.137
Come in.

09:02.434 --> 09:05.469
Hey! I was just thinking about you.

09:05.504 --> 09:08.238
- Yeah?
- What a powerful thing it was for you

09:08.274 --> 09:10.906
to admit your uncertainty
back at that board meeting.

09:10.931 --> 09:12.944
Really? It felt kind of inadequate.

09:12.979 --> 09:14.716
Oh, no. I liked it.

09:15.331 --> 09:18.501
- Is Mac taking a vacation?
- To Cuba, yeah.

09:18.537 --> 09:20.416
Some big expedition.

09:20.451 --> 09:21.417
When is he going?

09:21.452 --> 09:22.908
After the ceremony.

09:22.944 --> 09:24.089
For how long?

09:25.221 --> 09:26.603
Two weeks. Why?

09:27.298 --> 09:28.291
Will you help me keep him here?

09:30.530 --> 09:31.840
Why would I want to do that?

09:36.266 --> 09:37.666
Kevin?

09:37.861 --> 09:39.861
Are you in there?

09:40.437 --> 09:42.571
Hey, did you not hear me?

09:42.606 --> 09:46.716
No. No, um, what'd you say, babe?

09:48.278 --> 09:49.344
Nothing.

10:37.616 --> 10:39.058
What's the matter?

10:39.093 --> 10:42.227
Nothing, I'm just, uh, this song...

10:42.262 --> 10:44.992
- Charity, honey.
- Just give me a minute.

10:45.932 --> 10:47.263
Hormones.

10:49.367 --> 10:50.735
And then what happened?

10:50.771 --> 10:55.487
He held me down. I couldn't breathe.

10:56.709 --> 10:59.076
I begged him not to do it.

10:59.111 --> 11:01.695
- Turn it off.
-  He wouldn't stop.

11:02.314 --> 11:04.414
She was just about to say
exactly how Mac violated her.

11:04.449 --> 11:06.624
I can guess what
she was about to say, Gigi.

11:08.420 --> 11:11.721
I have emails from her,
from Darlene's daughter...

11:11.757 --> 11:13.157
I don't need any more evidence.

11:13.192 --> 11:14.864
We can't let him leave town.

11:15.679 --> 11:17.393
You want me to sit at a table

11:17.428 --> 11:19.863
with that man for the next three days

11:20.431 --> 11:22.665
knowing what he did to my daughter?

11:34.778 --> 11:37.913
I have known for 20 years.

11:44.754 --> 11:46.031
All right.

11:49.092 --> 11:50.657
All right.

11:55.764 --> 11:57.164
I'll talk to him.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.105
- Tennessee state?
- You got a minute?

12:13.140 --> 12:15.246
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

12:24.517 --> 12:26.652
I need you to postpone this trip.

12:26.687 --> 12:28.487
My ticket's nonrefundable.

12:28.522 --> 12:30.446
Well, I'll pay for the ticket.

12:31.157 --> 12:32.975
I paid for those charters, too.

12:33.010 --> 12:34.111
I'm not getting that back.

12:34.136 --> 12:37.595
I'll buy you a boat. Just stay.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.130
Why, though?

12:39.165 --> 12:40.797
I mean, I'm happy to.

12:40.832 --> 12:44.268
I just think we need to
hammer this gun thing out

12:44.303 --> 12:45.502
before it gets messy.

12:45.537 --> 12:47.437
What do I have to do with that?

12:47.473 --> 12:49.473
Noah's karate guy is coming here.

12:49.508 --> 12:51.775
I want to know that
we're properly insured

12:51.810 --> 12:53.777
in case one of our people
brings a gun next week

12:53.812 --> 12:55.204
to protect themselves...

12:56.521 --> 12:57.919
and kills somebody.

13:00.151 --> 13:01.244
It happens.

13:03.068 --> 13:04.284
All right.

13:04.928 --> 13:05.721
I'll stay.

13:07.292 --> 13:08.190
Thank you.

13:25.175 --> 13:26.893
He's never around.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.550
He's always at the gym or out for a run,

13:29.575 --> 13:31.708
and when he's home, he's on the phone.

13:31.733 --> 13:33.333
What is he doing on the phone?

13:33.358 --> 13:35.692
Ask him. Just ask him.

13:36.251 --> 13:39.019
I want to, but I'm scared.

13:39.054 --> 13:39.913
Of what?

13:40.589 --> 13:42.553
That he'll tell me the truth.

13:43.826 --> 13:45.377
That he'll say there's, um...

13:46.662 --> 13:47.628
there's another woman.

13:47.663 --> 13:49.386
Oh, another woman?

13:50.097 --> 13:51.498
What if there is one?

13:53.706 --> 13:55.535
There's only one way to find out.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.639
Come on.

14:02.310 --> 14:05.110
Well, there's still so much to do.

14:05.146 --> 14:06.689
Excuse me, ladies.

14:07.143 --> 14:11.416
Oh, Mac, this is Jocelyn
Edwards, Isabel's mother.

14:11.452 --> 14:13.308
This is my brother Robert McCready.

14:13.821 --> 14:15.031
Everybody calls me Mac.

14:15.356 --> 14:17.789
Can I tear you away?

14:17.825 --> 14:20.492
Oh, listen, I was just about
to take her out to the house.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.060
It'll just take a minute.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.461
All right, then.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.730
I will find you all in Noah's office...

14:25.765 --> 14:28.232
- Okay.
- ...once I'm released.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.637
What's the matter?

14:33.673 --> 14:34.805
James just came and asked me

14:34.841 --> 14:36.474
to delay my fishing trip to Cuba.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.808
Did you know anything about this?

14:37.844 --> 14:39.446
No. Did he tell you why?
Give you a reason?

14:39.471 --> 14:41.313
No, he just said he wanted me to stay

14:41.348 --> 14:42.966
and handle this gun business,

14:43.002 --> 14:44.381
but there's nothing legal to do.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.504
So, what did you tell him?

14:45.529 --> 14:47.149
Well, that I'd reschedule, of course.

14:47.185 --> 14:48.651
You know I live to serve,

14:48.687 --> 14:49.753
but I'm hoping you might talk to him

14:49.788 --> 14:51.320
and make it so I don't have to.

14:51.356 --> 14:53.416
I mean, he's all worked up about it.

14:53.451 --> 14:54.481
Huh.

14:54.826 --> 14:57.292
He's probably being extra careful

14:57.327 --> 14:58.425
because Noah's leaving.

14:59.329 --> 15:01.463
Keep the ticket. I'll talk to him.

15:01.492 --> 15:02.857
Okay. Thanks.

15:02.899 --> 15:04.232
I'll get back to it.

15:07.337 --> 15:09.805
Why do we even need to tell Mama?

15:09.840 --> 15:11.139
Because if what you say is true

15:11.174 --> 15:12.630
about those scholarships, Gigi,

15:13.343 --> 15:15.326
we'll have to get the man
to confess everything.

15:15.991 --> 15:19.483
Not just the assaults,
but the whole rest of it.

15:20.850 --> 15:24.616
If not, he'll drag this
whole church down with him.

15:25.121 --> 15:27.622
And your mother's the only one
that can get him to confess.

15:30.326 --> 15:31.792
Who is it?

15:31.827 --> 15:33.727
Sophia's dad. I'll call him back.

15:37.332 --> 15:38.799
I know this feels like a trial

15:38.834 --> 15:40.534
after the way we shut you
down the first time...

15:40.569 --> 15:41.930
No, no.

15:41.966 --> 15:44.407
but you're going to have to
deal your mother into this one.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.479
Deal me into what?

15:50.408 --> 15:52.708
and When did
you find out you were pregnant?

15:52.743 --> 15:55.511
Three months after it happened.

15:55.546 --> 15:56.979
And you're certain Mr. McCready

15:57.014 --> 15:59.014
is the father of that child?

15:59.049 --> 16:02.117
Yes, I've never been with anyone else.

16:04.221 --> 16:07.311
- Is that all?
- What do you mean, is that all?

16:08.225 --> 16:11.773
You need more? You heard what she said.

16:12.329 --> 16:15.362
Eve heard the snake in the garden,

16:15.398 --> 16:17.064
and aren't we glad she listened?

16:20.537 --> 16:21.669
I'm going to see my brother.

16:21.704 --> 16:23.340
About what?

16:23.365 --> 16:25.606
I want to hear his side of all this.

16:25.642 --> 16:27.140
She shouldn't tell him.

16:27.724 --> 16:29.249
Mae, there is no other side.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.344
What the girl is saying is true.

16:31.778 --> 16:33.379
What Vida's saying is true.

16:35.717 --> 16:38.463
Says who? You?

16:39.555 --> 16:42.355
Gigi? Danielle Turner?

16:42.390 --> 16:43.523
I don't know that girl.

16:43.558 --> 16:45.190
Her mouth ain't no prayer book.

16:45.225 --> 16:48.694
And Vida? Well, God bless Darlene,

16:48.729 --> 16:50.996
but we all know she wasn't raised right.

16:51.670 --> 16:55.701
I am going to talk
to the only human being

16:55.736 --> 16:59.538
who supposedly was there
for all these scenes.

16:59.935 --> 17:03.007
I will not have him tried in absentia.

17:04.192 --> 17:07.278
And your blind spot
when it comes to this girl

17:07.313 --> 17:10.214
will be your undoing.

17:10.249 --> 17:12.383
You mark my word, James,

17:12.417 --> 17:15.987
because she's a handservant
to the father of lies.

17:24.429 --> 17:25.996
You're going to have to tell Jacob.

17:28.946 --> 17:30.679
She obviously won't listen to you.

17:32.605 --> 17:34.437
And the way things are between
her and me since you're back,

17:34.473 --> 17:35.983
she won't listen to me.

17:37.078 --> 17:38.543
Jacob's her prince.

17:40.411 --> 17:41.978
Lord knows why.

17:49.587 --> 17:52.053
- Hey, hey. Bad news.
- What?

17:52.089 --> 17:54.388
- You have to tell Isabel.
- Why? What happened?

17:54.424 --> 17:56.224
My mother just found out and it's...

17:56.259 --> 17:57.726
I'm sorry. I tried.

17:57.761 --> 18:00.061
I have to go explain the
whole thing to Jacob now.

18:00.097 --> 18:01.395
Okay, thanks for telling me.

18:01.431 --> 18:02.862
I'm sorry.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.067
What are you doing
on that phone all the time?

18:06.103 --> 18:09.036
That's all I want to know.
Just show me the phone.

18:09.071 --> 18:12.205
- Seriously?
- Yes! Show me the phone.

18:12.241 --> 18:13.707
What don't you want me to see?

18:13.743 --> 18:15.042
All right, somebody's hungry.

18:15.077 --> 18:16.376
Oh, don't do that.

18:16.411 --> 18:17.577
Well, you're eating for three now.

18:17.613 --> 18:19.046
Give me the phone, Kevin.

18:19.081 --> 18:20.213
- No, Charity.
- Yes!

18:20.249 --> 18:22.049
- No!
- Give me the phone!

18:22.084 --> 18:23.550
No, Charity. I'm not going
to play into this. Stop!

18:23.585 --> 18:24.799
God!

18:25.254 --> 18:27.219
Listen, you're in a mood.
I know you are.

18:27.255 --> 18:28.554
This whole wedding got you thinking

18:28.589 --> 18:29.689
about how we were
when we first got married.

18:29.724 --> 18:30.782
We were all romantic,

18:30.807 --> 18:32.558
and you think that it's not
that romantic anymore.

18:32.593 --> 18:33.345
It's not!

18:33.370 --> 18:35.227
Well, maybe it's not for you.

18:35.263 --> 18:37.063
And maybe I'm sorry about that.

18:37.098 --> 18:39.464
But let me tell you something.

18:40.268 --> 18:44.036
I feel more romantic about
you and those two babies

18:44.071 --> 18:46.246
than the day we got married.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.686
Okay?

18:50.077 --> 18:51.710
Now, when you're ready to apologize,

18:51.745 --> 18:53.150
you know where you can find me.

18:53.413 --> 18:55.647
Yeah, at the gym.

18:57.851 --> 18:58.750
Excuse me.

19:08.094 --> 19:10.367
I was just helping that Turner girl.

19:12.053 --> 19:14.558
Yes, I paid for her abortion.

19:15.068 --> 19:16.951
I paid because her mother couldn't.

19:17.235 --> 19:18.702
And who was the father?

19:18.737 --> 19:20.570
Well, ask her. The hell if I know.

19:20.605 --> 19:23.039
- Mac!
- I'm sorry.

19:23.075 --> 19:24.224
I never asked.

19:24.642 --> 19:27.210
All right, so tell me
about this Vida business.

19:28.064 --> 19:29.148
Okay.

19:29.184 --> 19:31.514
Now you're going to ask me about
every woman I've ever known.

19:31.549 --> 19:34.815
- Just Vida. - Are we going
to sift through 20 years now?

19:35.753 --> 19:36.952
You didn't want to get audited.

19:36.987 --> 19:37.780
I don't want to get audited.

19:37.816 --> 19:40.249
Tell me what happened with Vida.

19:40.569 --> 19:42.224
She wanted to quit high school

19:42.259 --> 19:43.726
and go to beauty school,

19:43.761 --> 19:45.527
and Darlene couldn't afford to send her.

19:45.562 --> 19:47.210
She came to me in secret.

19:47.245 --> 19:49.364
She knew I ran
the scholarship committee.

19:49.399 --> 19:50.832
She asked me about the process.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.333
So, that wasn't hush money?

19:52.368 --> 19:53.567
For what? No!

19:54.325 --> 19:56.470
- And so Vida's a liar?
- Yes.

19:57.005 --> 19:59.540
- And Darlene is a liar?
-  Yes!

19:59.575 --> 20:01.442
And Danielle Turner is a liar?

20:01.477 --> 20:05.213
Danielle Turner already
admitted she's a liar, Mae.

20:05.248 --> 20:08.982
- She recanted!
- Why didn't you tell me about this?

20:09.017 --> 20:10.984
Because I didn't want to
bother you with it.

20:11.394 --> 20:13.354
Look what it's doing to us now.

20:14.025 --> 20:16.817
And it's all... it's all gossip.

20:17.601 --> 20:18.631
All slander.

20:20.074 --> 20:23.362
Mae, because of my work,

20:23.398 --> 20:25.530
because of my access to money and power,

20:25.566 --> 20:27.807
I'm involved with a lot of people.

20:28.069 --> 20:30.055
Half of them are women.

20:30.404 --> 20:32.537
And because they know
I've got a good heart

20:32.573 --> 20:34.206
and because I'm a Christian,

20:34.242 --> 20:36.678
that makes me a target.

20:37.078 --> 20:39.270
I'm not saying I'm perfect,

20:39.580 --> 20:42.013
but even the Bible says
Jesus made his bed

20:42.048 --> 20:45.049
with the poor and the
outcast, and people talked!

20:45.085 --> 20:48.286
- Leave Jesus out of this.
- You know what I'm saying!

20:48.321 --> 20:50.747
- Leave Jesus out of this!
- You know what I'm saying!

20:58.731 --> 21:00.582
You remember what Mama used to say?

21:00.617 --> 21:02.099
Oh, now, come on.

21:02.134 --> 21:03.967
We're all we've got.

21:07.774 --> 21:09.076
You...

21:09.741 --> 21:11.641
are all I've got.

21:12.044 --> 21:15.378
You and James and this church.

21:15.414 --> 21:18.547
You really think I would
weigh all that in my mind

21:18.582 --> 21:21.050
and do some mess like this to you?

21:21.085 --> 21:22.484
Well, maybe...

21:25.595 --> 21:26.827
Maybe what?

21:29.066 --> 21:30.566
Maybe your mind isn't right.

21:32.396 --> 21:35.455
Well, I don't know what to say to that.

21:36.390 --> 21:37.551
Say you didn't do it.

21:37.579 --> 21:39.034
That's what I've been
saying the whole time.

21:39.069 --> 21:41.868
- I did not do it.
- Any of it!

21:41.903 --> 21:45.140
- Any of it!
- And that you never touched Faith.

21:45.175 --> 21:48.376
No, no. I loved her.

21:48.411 --> 21:50.912
I think about her every day.

21:52.751 --> 21:56.717
It's a crime that Faith is not here

21:57.151 --> 22:00.221
and Gigi's still here
to trouble you like this.

22:00.256 --> 22:01.917
Oh, Lord Jesus.

22:04.742 --> 22:06.311
But you know.

22:08.192 --> 22:09.450
You know how it is.

22:10.398 --> 22:14.367
God takes the best for himself and
leaves the rest of us to shift.

22:16.242 --> 22:18.171
Faith was the best.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.888
All right.

22:28.208 --> 22:31.408
I'm so sorry that I had
to come to you with this.

22:32.052 --> 22:33.536
I'm glad you did.

22:39.345 --> 22:42.493
We'll get through this.

22:42.815 --> 22:46.299
I know we will. Mm-hmm.

22:49.735 --> 22:53.537
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you every little detail

22:53.975 --> 22:55.428
of what was going on every day.

22:55.463 --> 22:58.375
No, I know. You handle things.

22:58.410 --> 23:01.278
Nobody knows that better than I do.

23:04.397 --> 23:06.070
You want me to talk to James?

23:06.104 --> 23:08.859
No. No.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.724
I'll deal with him,
and I'll send him up here

23:14.759 --> 23:18.490
so y'all can make the peace
man-to-man one last time.

23:20.178 --> 23:21.030
Oh.

23:21.065 --> 23:22.952
You do believe me, don't you?

23:24.067 --> 23:26.139
That's the thing.

23:27.751 --> 23:28.983
I do.

23:31.842 --> 23:32.906
I do.

23:39.416 --> 23:41.049
Okay.

23:41.084 --> 23:42.616
Settle down.

24:14.498 --> 24:15.714
I'm going to kill him.

24:16.173 --> 24:17.492
I mean it. I'm going to kill him.

24:17.538 --> 24:18.503
Jacob.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.632
What if he did this to Zora?

24:21.589 --> 24:23.417
I'm going to go kill him right now.

24:23.452 --> 24:24.930
Jacob, killing him

24:24.965 --> 24:26.557
isn't going to do the ten... twenty...

24:26.593 --> 24:29.356
whoever knows how many girls
he did this to any good.

24:30.398 --> 24:32.175
This isn't about Mac.
This is about them.

24:32.210 --> 24:33.563
This is about Faith.

24:34.085 --> 24:35.733
God! I just...

24:36.119 --> 24:38.216
feel so stupid.

24:39.337 --> 24:40.735
You told us back then.

24:42.486 --> 24:43.573
You said it all.

24:43.962 --> 24:45.455
I know, but Daddy didn't believe me.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.258
Mama didn't believe me.

24:49.463 --> 24:52.282
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I did...

24:57.857 --> 24:58.768
...deep down.

24:58.803 --> 25:00.145
But I just...

25:01.393 --> 25:03.226
I just didn't say anything.

25:04.124 --> 25:05.295
You were just a kid.

25:13.123 --> 25:14.022
Come on.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.377
Is this why you came home?

25:23.228 --> 25:25.340
Unh-uh. No.

25:27.964 --> 25:29.529
But it's why I stayed.

25:32.277 --> 25:35.790
So, what do you say? You with me?

25:36.955 --> 25:39.590
Because it turns out you're the most
important person in this family.

25:42.765 --> 25:43.997
Come on.

25:46.102 --> 25:47.668
Yeah, I'm with you.

25:55.188 --> 25:56.454
Come on.

26:04.186 --> 26:08.195
Hey. Jocelyn, would you give
Isabel and me a minute?

26:08.495 --> 26:10.094
Oh, certainly.

26:13.760 --> 26:16.395
Our kid's going to be so much
cuter than my brother's.

26:16.430 --> 26:17.501
Yikes!

26:18.265 --> 26:21.644
Hey, I need to tell you something.

26:22.955 --> 26:23.875
What's the matter?

26:29.075 --> 26:30.308
Come in.

26:36.641 --> 26:38.316
Here are the items you requested.

26:38.351 --> 26:40.717
Is this all the women who got
the First Lady's scholarship?

26:40.752 --> 26:42.719
Yes, sir, and a little bit about

26:42.754 --> 26:46.095
what each of them did with
the money, supposedly.

26:46.925 --> 26:47.924
How many of them are there?

26:48.263 --> 26:49.575
150.

26:50.542 --> 26:54.501
- Janice Turner in here?
- And Vida, yes, sir.

26:55.267 --> 26:56.263
Thank you.

26:57.401 --> 26:59.040
How many others were there?

26:59.370 --> 27:02.271
We don't know,
but we're going to find out.

27:02.770 --> 27:04.706
I feel so ashamed, Bishop.

27:04.742 --> 27:05.478
- Darlene...

27:05.503 --> 27:07.876
- I know it was wrong to take that money.

27:07.911 --> 27:09.054
Darlene.

27:10.080 --> 27:13.833
Life is so short and so strange,

27:13.868 --> 27:15.368
and, God forgive me for saying so,

27:15.404 --> 27:16.854
so hard for so many.

27:18.255 --> 27:20.221
Anyone who finds
a safe place to rest in it

27:20.257 --> 27:23.891
can't be faulted for sometimes thinking

27:23.926 --> 27:27.195
it might be better
to just let some things be.

27:27.682 --> 27:30.935
But you blame yourself
for what happened to Faith.

27:30.970 --> 27:32.065
I see it.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.733
Yes, I do. That's right.

27:33.769 --> 27:35.455
And I do, too, for my Vida.

27:35.937 --> 27:39.039
What you said, that kind of
thing is true for other people,

27:39.074 --> 27:41.007
but it's never true for yourself.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.176
You might be right.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.823
I could've done better.

27:47.748 --> 27:49.748
It's okay for you to tell me that.

27:49.784 --> 27:51.045
- It's the truth.
- It's okay.

27:56.757 --> 27:58.110
Darlene, God bless you.

27:58.759 --> 27:59.892
God bless you, too, First Lady.

28:00.099 --> 28:01.332
I'm so sorry.

28:04.431 --> 28:06.738
I'm so sorry.

28:06.773 --> 28:08.266
You know, if we had known,

28:08.302 --> 28:09.234
we never would have let...

28:09.269 --> 28:10.702
I know, I know.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.306
I'll leave you two be.

28:22.915 --> 28:23.980
What did he say?

28:26.719 --> 28:27.782
That he didn't do it?

28:29.088 --> 28:31.154
That this is some conspiracy?

28:33.592 --> 28:36.147
Do you remember when she was little,

28:37.096 --> 28:39.195
at bedtime, she'd...

28:40.716 --> 28:44.100
she'd say, "Love you.

28:44.902 --> 28:47.707
Be careful. Take care. Good night."

28:49.027 --> 28:50.715
Every night the same.

28:51.243 --> 28:52.179
Yeah.

28:52.204 --> 28:55.111
And that same little angel had to be...

28:55.146 --> 28:56.431
I know.

28:57.013 --> 28:58.647
What are we going to do?

29:01.892 --> 29:03.558
We're going to get through tonight.

29:05.256 --> 29:06.988
And we're get through this wedding.

29:09.059 --> 29:10.473
And then we're going to drag

29:10.509 --> 29:12.441
that sumbitch down Monday morning

29:12.476 --> 29:17.425
down to the jail and lock his ass up.

29:21.070 --> 29:21.933
Forever.

29:22.796 --> 29:24.639
Lord have mercy.

29:35.011 --> 29:36.126
Well, he has Mrs. Farmer

29:36.151 --> 29:37.278
but in order to pay your rent,

29:37.303 --> 29:40.053
we'd have to get that information
from you today, so...

29:44.125 --> 29:46.759
Yeah. Yeah, well, you're very welcome.

29:46.794 --> 29:48.456
I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer.
I have to go, okay?

29:49.797 --> 29:51.096
All the time.

29:52.461 --> 29:53.584
- Hi.
-  Hey.

29:53.619 --> 29:55.100
Well, where's your worse half?

29:55.136 --> 29:57.491
I actually asked him if I
could talk to you alone.

29:58.204 --> 29:59.904
I just thought it'd be easier.

29:59.939 --> 30:00.856
About what?

30:01.889 --> 30:03.841
Noah told me about Mr. McCready.

30:04.746 --> 30:06.177
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

30:06.212 --> 30:08.392
No, no. I am.

30:08.815 --> 30:10.048
For what?

30:10.553 --> 30:12.256
Ever since you got back, Grace,

30:12.291 --> 30:17.353
I've been feeling like
something was... would happen.

30:18.523 --> 30:19.881
With what?

30:19.916 --> 30:21.222
I don't know.

30:22.309 --> 30:24.422
Obviously, you two
meant a lot to each other,

30:24.457 --> 30:25.683
so I just thought something...

30:25.718 --> 30:26.797
Oh, no.

30:27.780 --> 30:29.813
I know, but it's how I felt.

30:32.343 --> 30:34.554
And recently, you two were
spending so much time together,

30:34.589 --> 30:36.757
so I just felt like something
was going to happen.

30:37.809 --> 30:40.076
But then he told me about Mr. McCready,

30:40.509 --> 30:42.837
and so I get it, and I'm sorry.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.715
I'm sorry if I've been unfriendly.

30:47.985 --> 30:49.764
I was just feeling insecure.

30:51.627 --> 30:53.061
I totally understand.

30:56.126 --> 30:58.115
And you didn't have to explain it to me,

30:58.140 --> 31:01.817
- so, thank you.
- No, thank you.

31:06.135 --> 31:07.601
Grace, what did you think

31:07.636 --> 31:08.780
I wanted to talk to you about?

31:10.053 --> 31:11.565
I didn't know.

31:12.637 --> 31:13.757
Oh.

31:34.295 --> 31:35.864
There's the hotel,

31:36.297 --> 31:38.096
and there's the bungalow.

31:38.131 --> 31:40.389
Oh, right on the beach.

31:40.424 --> 31:43.008
Yeah, you can just
walk right out and jump in.

31:43.670 --> 31:45.544
Mom, can you give us a moment?

31:46.106 --> 31:47.605
Honey, is something the matter?

31:47.641 --> 31:48.431
No.

31:49.064 --> 31:51.777
It is absolutely beautiful, Noah.

31:51.812 --> 31:54.785
The two of you are going to
make wonderful memories there.

32:02.789 --> 32:04.002
Hey.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.081
Did you sleep with Grace?

32:11.962 --> 32:13.430
Why would ask me that?

32:13.753 --> 32:16.699
I'm giving you one chance
to tell me the truth, Noah.

32:18.804 --> 32:19.794
Did you?

32:23.775 --> 32:25.275
If you tell me the truth right now,

32:25.310 --> 32:27.273
just admit you made a mistake.

32:27.645 --> 32:28.711
We can move forward.

32:31.615 --> 32:34.907
But I cannot go into this
marriage with a lie.

32:38.455 --> 32:40.122
Did you sleep with her?

32:48.298 --> 32:50.431
Thank you for not lying to me.

32:50.466 --> 32:52.974
- I didn't say anything.
- You didn't have to!

32:53.636 --> 32:55.436
You know what? You two...

32:55.471 --> 32:57.764
you two, you deserve each
other, you know that?

32:57.799 --> 32:59.440
- Isa...
- Take that. I don't want it.

32:59.475 --> 33:01.275
- Isabel...
- Don't call my name.

33:01.311 --> 33:02.595
Don't say my name.

33:03.479 --> 33:06.213
I don't want to marry Grace.
I want to marry you.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.081
Really? You have a
really interesting way

33:08.116 --> 33:09.549
of showing that, Noah.

33:09.584 --> 33:12.418
- Isabel...
- Don't say my name.

33:14.622 --> 33:18.091
You know, I knew we
should've left this place

33:18.126 --> 33:19.425
when she came back.

33:19.461 --> 33:21.761
I knew you were too weak, but I waited.

33:21.930 --> 33:23.863
I waited because I believed in you!

33:27.801 --> 33:29.601
You can tell everyone at the mansion

33:29.636 --> 33:30.897
that the wedding's off.

33:30.932 --> 33:32.747
These people aren't my problem anymore.

33:45.285 --> 33:46.751
Have I done something wrong?

33:46.786 --> 33:49.254
No. Honey, you haven't
done anything wrong.

33:49.289 --> 33:51.722
Your dad and I just need to
ask you a few questions.

33:51.758 --> 33:54.058
Are you and Uncle Mac close, princess?

33:54.446 --> 33:57.094
Close how? He's my uncle.

33:57.129 --> 33:58.428
Well, what Dad means

33:58.463 --> 34:02.266
is do you and Uncle Mac
spend time together

34:02.301 --> 34:03.767
that we don't know about?

34:03.802 --> 34:06.370
I see him around sometimes, yeah.

34:06.405 --> 34:10.940
- Like where?
- Here at the house or at church.

34:10.976 --> 34:13.074
So, you've been spending
time with Uncle Mac

34:13.110 --> 34:14.377
you haven't told us about?

34:14.411 --> 34:16.578
Jacob.

34:16.614 --> 34:18.947
Can I be honest? Really honest?

34:18.983 --> 34:21.583
- Please.
- That's all we're asking, sweetheart.

34:22.038 --> 34:24.587
You two are freaking me out.

34:24.621 --> 34:26.255
Mom ordered pizza.

34:26.291 --> 34:28.121
Dad keeps calling me princess.

34:28.924 --> 34:31.588
You both said I could watch TV.

34:32.762 --> 34:34.029
Do I have brain cancer?

34:34.063 --> 34:37.565
No, no. You don't have cancer.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.601
So, what's going on?

34:39.636 --> 34:41.436
There's been a little scare

34:41.471 --> 34:44.005
and we just want to make sure we
have all the facts before we...

34:44.041 --> 34:46.308
Um, has...

34:47.779 --> 34:49.922
has Uncle Mac ever...

34:52.114 --> 34:55.748
...ever touched you in a way
that makes you uncomfortable?

34:55.926 --> 34:57.451
Why? Is he a perv?

34:57.486 --> 34:59.019
Answer the question, baby.

34:59.055 --> 35:02.022
No, he hasn't. What happened?

35:02.058 --> 35:03.757
Okay.

35:03.792 --> 35:06.192
Well, we'll tell you soon, I promise.

35:06.227 --> 35:07.994
I'm 16.

35:08.029 --> 35:10.029
- Go. Watch TV.
- Go watch TV.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.267
Thank you. I will do just that.

35:13.301 --> 35:17.088
And for now, just keep
this between us, okay?

35:17.752 --> 35:18.984
Who else would I tell?

35:22.260 --> 35:23.742
Promise not to tell anyone I told you.

35:23.777 --> 35:25.243
I promise.

35:25.448 --> 35:27.079
Did he ever try anything with you?

35:27.114 --> 35:29.414
Not really.

35:29.450 --> 35:32.084
A few months ago, I sat next
to him in Granddaddy's car

35:32.119 --> 35:34.825
on the way home from some
huge dinner in Millington,

35:35.289 --> 35:36.754
and his hand was beside my leg,

35:36.790 --> 35:39.590
like, touching my leg.

35:39.625 --> 35:42.426
And he kept it there. He didn't move it.

35:42.462 --> 35:47.912
So, I slid over. That's weird, right?

35:48.301 --> 35:49.752
Yeah.

35:50.103 --> 35:52.069
He didn't try anything with you, did he?

35:52.105 --> 35:55.179
No, but he seemed really nice.

35:55.632 --> 35:57.507
I think that's how it works.

36:04.016 --> 36:06.249
I mean, just being in God's presence,

36:06.284 --> 36:08.038
hanging out with God,

36:08.702 --> 36:10.087
it'll help us to figure out

36:10.122 --> 36:12.254
how to forgive those imperfect people

36:12.289 --> 36:14.710
and love them just the way they are.

36:15.629 --> 36:19.694
This life God's given us
is not about perfection.

36:22.424 --> 36:23.848
It's about love.

37:43.074 --> 37:44.369
You were going to just leave?

37:44.649 --> 37:46.715
I was trying to give you two some space.

37:47.511 --> 37:48.951
There is no "us two" anymore.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.953
The wedding's off.

37:53.106 --> 37:54.750
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

37:56.620 --> 37:57.819
Just tell me one thing.

37:59.363 --> 38:00.795
Did you do it on purpose?

38:00.830 --> 38:02.069
No.

38:03.444 --> 38:04.443
I didn't say anything.

38:04.468 --> 38:06.185
She figured it out on her own.

38:07.562 --> 38:09.228
All I want is for you to be happy.

38:34.736 --> 38:37.202
This is the day the Lord has made.

38:37.860 --> 38:39.062
Beautiful day.

38:39.781 --> 38:40.680
Yeah.

38:45.707 --> 38:47.263
Get you a water or something?

38:48.118 --> 38:49.441
No, I'm good, thanks.

39:00.025 --> 39:01.592
What you got there, James?

39:03.909 --> 39:06.910
I used to keep this at home by the bed.

39:08.974 --> 39:10.708
After what happened last Sunday,

39:11.590 --> 39:13.112
I brought it to church.

39:14.326 --> 39:15.726
I didn't tell anybody.

39:18.317 --> 39:19.717
Just thought I might need it.

39:23.354 --> 39:25.287
Mae wasn't able to convince you.

39:27.423 --> 39:29.456
You didn't convince her.

39:37.307 --> 39:38.305
You're still here, Darlene?

39:39.363 --> 39:40.989
I just wanted to say thank you.

39:41.599 --> 39:43.261
You're making this place better.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.327
Grace, the Lord brought you back here,

39:45.363 --> 39:47.963
and I know it hasn't been easy for you,

39:47.998 --> 39:49.498
but you did it.

39:49.890 --> 39:51.099
Thank you.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.875
Put him away.

39:56.683 --> 39:57.749
I'm trying.

40:04.281 --> 40:06.815
- Pastor Greenleaf?
- Not now, Thomas.

40:06.851 --> 40:08.050
It's a small thing.

40:08.085 --> 40:09.322
Whatever it is, I just can't.

40:09.357 --> 40:11.220
It's a small essay
about my faith journey.

40:11.255 --> 40:13.054
Thomas, will you leave me alone?

40:13.089 --> 40:15.890
I can't help you. I can't save you.

40:15.925 --> 40:17.558
I can't get you on the deacon board.

40:18.059 --> 40:19.559
Just leave me alone.

40:35.110 --> 40:36.743
Karine, do you know where the bishop is?

40:36.778 --> 40:38.178
I don't know.

40:53.928 --> 40:55.494
You never had a child, did you?

40:57.734 --> 40:59.198
Not that I know of.

41:00.935 --> 41:02.309
I have to believe that

41:02.770 --> 41:04.568
that's part of what makes
you do what you do.

41:04.604 --> 41:08.072
I haven't... done anything.

41:08.108 --> 41:11.276
- Please, don't lie anymore.
- James.

41:11.311 --> 41:14.597
You never knew that feeling
of making a person...

41:16.283 --> 41:18.277
of being a partner with God

41:18.919 --> 41:20.150
and making a person...

41:22.922 --> 41:25.155
