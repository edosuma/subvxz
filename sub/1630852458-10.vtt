WEBVTT

00:50.133 --> 00:52.343
Sir, I need you to relax, please.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.388
-Do you know who you are?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.559
-Can you tell me your name?
-I…

01:00.518 --> 01:02.103
-Lie back down.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.815
Call that detective.
Tell him his John Doe is awake.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.410
Good news.
Looks like it’s just a pulled muscle.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.246
-It may ache, but you’ll be fine.
-Oh, thank God.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.832
So does that mean
that I can keep fighting?

01:22.916 --> 01:26.836
They've given you 30 minutes to recover.
So let the pain guide you.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.924
If it's telling you to sit this one out,
I'd listen. I'll get you an ice pack.

01:31.007 --> 01:31.925
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.139
-How's it feel now?
-Not bad. Just a little sore.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.308
Miggy, you don’t have to continue.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.353
Don’t worry, Mom.
If something feels off, I won’t fight.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.189
-Make sure he's okay.
-Of course.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.235
You were so good out there.

01:50.318 --> 01:53.988
Especially when you kicked
that one kid in the face.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.365
<i>Gracias, Yaya.</i>

01:58.284 --> 01:59.327
Ciao.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.289
All right. We’ve got a half-hour.
Show your back who’s boss.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.709
<i>Robby Keene is ahead one-nothing</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:09.254
<i>as he and Demetri Alexopoulos</i>
<i>battle it out</i>

02:09.337 --> 02:10.922
<i>for a trip to the finals.</i>

02:12.590 --> 02:13.800
Point. Keene.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.343
Score, two-zero.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.553
Go to your senseis.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.222
All right.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.977
I had it hard beating him
when he was on the good side of the force.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.353
Now that he’s gone all Sith,

02:25.436 --> 02:28.273
I feel like a helpless Jedi youngling
about to get slaughtered.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.566
Well, you’re taller.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.026
You have the high ground.
That's how Obi-Wan beat Anakin.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.320
All right,
just remember your fundamentals.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.824
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe through.
You got this. Come on, Demetri.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.537
-Let's go.
-On your marks.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.082
Ready.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.252
And fight!

02:53.131 --> 02:54.966
That's a block. No point.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.023
-Ais!
-Point.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.441
Winner.

03:22.118 --> 03:22.952
Okay.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.787
He's very good.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.831
So are you.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.666
-Thank you.
-Come on.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.593
<i>All participants</i>
<i>in the girls' semifinals,</i>

03:38.676 --> 03:42.347
<i>please report to the center mat.</i>
<i>Matches begin in five minutes.</i>

03:43.556 --> 03:44.390
Hey, dude.

03:46.017 --> 03:46.851
I, uh…

03:47.894 --> 03:49.771
I saw your… Saw your match out there.

03:49.854 --> 03:50.688
Uh…

03:51.564 --> 03:54.484
Uh, and, you know,
I saw Robby compete last year. He's, uh…

03:55.235 --> 03:56.861
You know, he's one of the best.

03:56.945 --> 03:57.820
What do you want?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.575
Um, I guess I just wanted to say that

04:03.576 --> 04:04.827
I'm sorry, okay?

04:04.911 --> 04:07.038
For all the… For all the shit I did.

04:07.121 --> 04:10.208
Y-You know, it wasn't cool.
And I guess I was just trying--

04:10.291 --> 04:13.878
To impress your friends by picking
on the new kid who didn't have any.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.590
Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.843
I just… I can… I can… I can imagine
what it must have felt like.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.011
Oh, you can imagine?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.514
Okay, go ahead.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.101
-Uh, go ahead and…
-Tell me how it felt.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.979
Well, like, not, uh, great?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.230
Then you wouldn't know.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.734
Because no one's ever been
such a piece of shit to you!

04:38.278 --> 04:40.196
Well, maybe it's time you found out.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.078
How does that feel, LaPusso?
Not great? Man, get up, get up!

04:55.920 --> 04:57.171
What are you doing?

04:57.255 --> 04:58.881
Just getting payback on the kid

04:58.965 --> 05:01.092
who thought he could bully me
and get away with it.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.929
Anthony LaRusso was your bully?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.264
Not anymore.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.476
Do you hear that?

05:11.519 --> 05:13.438
Get ready for high school next year

05:13.521 --> 05:15.940
because you're gonna be
in a world of pain.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.901
Hey.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.322
This is not how I trained you.

05:22.905 --> 05:23.781
It's Cobra Kai.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.284
No mercy.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.586
-Anthony, are you okay?
-I'm fine. Just… Just leave me alone.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.672
-Anthony--
-I said leave me alone!

05:45.511 --> 05:48.723
<i>This semifinal match</i>
<i>has been all Cobra Kai.</i>

05:49.265 --> 05:52.518
<i>Tory Nichols is on her way</i>
<i>to the big dance.</i>

05:52.602 --> 05:53.478
Winner!

05:53.561 --> 05:55.980
<i>Oh, it's gonna be</i>
<i>a battle for the ages,</i>

05:56.064 --> 05:59.817
<i>because here comes</i>
<i>Samantha LaRusso and Miyagi-Do.</i>

06:02.862 --> 06:04.238
Point! Winner!

06:04.864 --> 06:07.367
<i>The girls' final is set.</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:14.874
-How's the boy?
-Like you give a shit.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.127
Look,

06:18.836 --> 06:21.089
what happened with Terry
back in the old dojo,

06:21.881 --> 06:23.257
I didn't know he was gonna do that.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.094
-I don't have time for this shit.
-It didn't have to be this way.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.097
You could have been with me
and your real son.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.228
You don’t care about Robby
any more than about me.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.187
Bullshit.

06:36.854 --> 06:40.441
-I cared more about you than anyone.
-You had a funny way of showing it.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.112
You forced me to fight dirty.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.321
<i>Sweep the leg.</i>

06:45.405 --> 06:47.156
You have a problem with that?

06:48.616 --> 06:49.492
No, Sensei.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.411
No mercy.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.331
You sacrificed my soul
so Cobra Kai could stay number one.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.791
That is not true.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.168
I wanted you to be number one.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.629
But you were down two-zero.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.840
<i>And you were about to be beaten.</i>

07:03.923 --> 07:06.634
<i>And I knew that would take you</i>
<i>into a downward spiral.</i>

07:07.593 --> 07:08.886
And I was right.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.681
Because no matter what people say,

07:11.764 --> 07:14.559
it does matter whether you win or lose.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.020
And if I can help Robby win,

07:18.104 --> 07:20.606
he’ll remember it
for the rest of his life.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.275
And maybe someday,

07:22.942 --> 07:25.570
he can be the one to keep Cobra Kai going.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.405
No, that's never gonna happen.

07:28.865 --> 07:29.824
Because tonight,

07:30.741 --> 07:32.243
Cobra Kai’s gonna die.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.418
<i>The remaining</i>
<i>boys' semifinal match</i>

07:40.501 --> 07:42.211
<i>will resume in five minutes.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:43.629
Here, rub some of this on.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.756
We have to hurry.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.343
Sensei, I-I don't know if I can do this.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.303
Yes, you can.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.681
You can do whatever you want
if you want it bad enough.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.645
Look, I know you're not 100%,
but you got the heart of a champion.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.609
Everything you've learned and been through
was just a warm-up for this moment.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.154
It's time to show the world
what you're made of.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.243
Give it your all. Do what I tell you,
and we’ll not only take down Cobra Kai,

08:14.327 --> 08:17.580
we’ll show LaRusso and everybody else
who’s really the best.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.583
-That's what this is about.
-Hey.

08:21.250 --> 08:24.629
We're not gonna get another shot at this.
It's now or never.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.172
You know what's at stake?

08:26.255 --> 08:29.175
If we lose, I'm not your sensei anymore.
You want that?

08:32.094 --> 08:34.055
All right, then prove it. Fight for it.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.516
Show me you're not a kid anymore.
All right?

08:37.433 --> 08:39.101
Show me you're ready to be a man.

08:41.103 --> 08:41.979
Can you do that?

08:44.690 --> 08:45.525
Yes.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.318
Sensei.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.361
All right, good.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.405
Rub that on.
You got this. I’ll see you out there.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.870
Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do
are neck-and-neck on the leaderboard.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.414
But there's a dark horse…

09:00.498 --> 09:02.333
Or should I say a dark bird?

09:02.416 --> 09:04.544
…that still has a chance.

09:05.044 --> 09:09.048
Will Eagle Fang Karate stay alive
in our dojo race?

09:10.007 --> 09:11.592
We're about to find out.

09:12.176 --> 09:16.597
Miguel Diaz has one minute
to return to the mat!

09:19.100 --> 09:20.351
Countdown clock?

09:21.352 --> 09:22.979
Kind of dramatic, isn't it?

09:23.062 --> 09:24.480
Yeah, it's the All Valley.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.004
He's really taking it
down to the wire, huh?

09:54.927 --> 09:58.472
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.474
six, five,

10:00.558 --> 10:01.601
four,

10:01.684 --> 10:02.602
three,

10:02.685 --> 10:04.437
two, one!

10:06.897 --> 10:07.773
Well,

10:08.983 --> 10:11.819
it looks like
Miguel Diaz is not gonna fight.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.238
Which means

10:15.239 --> 10:18.451
that the winner by default
is Eli Moskowitz,

10:18.993 --> 10:20.620
who advances to the final

10:21.203 --> 10:23.080
where he will face Robby Keene.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.916
The finals are up next.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.712
Johnny. What happened?

10:30.963 --> 10:31.964
I blew it.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.257
Where's Miguel?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.175
I don't know.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.469
I came back. He's not in there.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.722
He's probably afraid to see you.
He thinks he let you down.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.557
No, I'm the one that let him down.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.434
-No.
-Yeah.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.565
Congrats.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.276
Heard you made it to the finals.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.821
What happened to you? Are you okay?

10:56.405 --> 10:57.365
Yeah. I'm fine.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.033
It just felt like

11:00.701 --> 11:02.745
I wasn't fighting for me anymore.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.330
I get that.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.249
I feel pressure from my dad all the time.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.169
Yeah, except that

11:11.379 --> 11:12.588
Johnny isn't my dad.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.386
Anyways, uh, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.262
And let you know--

11:20.346 --> 11:23.099
<i>All finalists,</i>
<i>please report to the center mat.</i>

11:24.684 --> 11:28.270
I gotta go. But I’ll see you
out there rooting for me, right?

11:30.856 --> 11:32.149
I'm always rooting for you, Sam.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.122
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:46.205 --> 11:48.332
the wait is finally over.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.043
It's finals time!

11:52.753 --> 11:55.589
Since Cobra Kai scored the most points,

11:55.673 --> 11:59.427
they only need to win one match
to be crowned Grand Champion.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.344
But

12:01.220 --> 12:03.097
if Miyagi-Do wins both matches,

12:03.806 --> 12:05.141
the title is theirs!

12:05.224 --> 12:07.643
Ooh, high drama!

12:08.644 --> 12:10.771
Up first, the boys' fight!

12:11.313 --> 12:13.899
Good luck to all of our fighters!

12:13.983 --> 12:15.234
Let's go!

12:18.696 --> 12:19.572
This is it.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.577
Time to show LaRusso and your father
that you don't need them.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.121
That you're strong enough on your own.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.461
My chance to get back at Robby
for what he did to me.

12:33.544 --> 12:37.173
This fight is not about him. The biggest
battle is always the one within.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.468
Okay, concentrate, defense, focus, power.

12:40.551 --> 12:44.138
You find your balance,
and those points will come. All right?

12:44.221 --> 12:45.347
Competitors.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.849
Go out there. Go get him.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.114
Face this way. Bow.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.159
Face each other. Bow.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.039
Ready and fight!

13:16.879 --> 13:18.964
Point! One-zero, Keene.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.759
-Let's go, baby!
-On your marks.

13:23.052 --> 13:23.928
Time out.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.811
He knows all my moves. He trained
at Miyagi-Do way longer than me.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.777
And you were in Cobra Kai longer than him.

13:39.860 --> 13:43.906
You each know each other’s karate
better than anyone. Put <i>him </i>on defense.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.212
Ready? And fight!

14:11.809 --> 14:13.185
Point, Miyagi-Do!

14:13.269 --> 14:14.395
On your marks.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.355
Woo! Go, Eli!

14:16.939 --> 14:17.857
Score, one-one.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.525
Ready?

14:20.317 --> 14:21.360
And fight!

14:35.416 --> 14:37.126
No point. Blocked.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.127
Continue.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.353
Continue.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.235
No point. Blocked.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.584
No point. Continue!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.054
Back to your sides.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.515
Unbelievable!

15:34.183 --> 15:37.478
These two amazing competitors

15:37.561 --> 15:40.689
have reached their three-minute time limit
in a one-one tie!

15:40.773 --> 15:44.485
Which means their championship match
will be decided,

15:44.568 --> 15:47.321
for the first time since 1985,

15:47.821 --> 15:49.615
by sudden-death overtime!

15:50.991 --> 15:51.909
Let's go!

16:11.470 --> 16:12.596
Go to your senseis.

16:17.309 --> 16:21.355
You're showing him respect.
This fight should be over by now.

16:22.439 --> 16:23.816
Do you wanna fight him?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.528
You're angry.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.697
Good.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.656
Use it.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.408
That was incredible!

16:32.491 --> 16:34.201
Any advice on the last point?

16:42.209 --> 16:43.335
Give him all you got.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.967
Competitors, to the mat.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.501
Next point wins.
Good luck, gentlemen. Ready?

17:25.753 --> 17:27.337
-And…

17:29.923 --> 17:31.133
fight!

18:04.833 --> 18:09.254
-No point.

18:11.965 --> 18:12.883
Continue.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.567
-No point! Continue.
-It's okay.

18:38.826 --> 18:39.660
Come on.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.286
Come on!

18:45.916 --> 18:47.501
Point! Winner!

18:50.129 --> 18:51.755
Yeah!

18:51.839 --> 18:52.881
Woo!

18:57.094 --> 18:58.679
Your boys' champion,

18:59.304 --> 19:03.267
Eli Moskowitz!

19:04.810 --> 19:06.228
Yeah!

19:06.311 --> 19:09.982
And with that,
Miyagi-Do vaults into the overall lead!

19:10.691 --> 19:14.069
It all comes down to the girls' final,

19:14.570 --> 19:15.946
coming up next.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.159
Yeah!

19:24.204 --> 19:25.080
Robby.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.708
You all right?

19:28.709 --> 19:29.543
Yeah.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.379
Focus on your fight. I just, um…

19:33.755 --> 19:35.132
I just need to clear my head.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.016
I, uh, guess it all comes down
to the final match.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.103
-Yeah, I have to get back in there.
-I, uh, spoke to Dr. Hillier.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.106
She said you’ve been keeping up
with your appointments.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.819
Yeah, she helped me find a volunteer
to help with my mom.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.447
Thanks, I owe you for that.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.783
Well, then you can pay me back now.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.912
By making sure Sam doesn't get hurt.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.749
-It's karate. How can I promise--
-I'm not asking you to back down.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.543
I just want you to play by the rules.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.755
Even if I still don't understand them.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.842
Okay, I'm gonna go out there
and root for my daughter.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.220
But what I’m really rooting for

20:21.303 --> 20:25.807
is that this fight finally puts an end
to all this bullshit between you two.

20:32.940 --> 20:33.899
My money's on Sam.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.651
I don't know.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.903
Nichols is on the warpath.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.738
Johnny.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.453
What do you want?

20:48.413 --> 20:49.289
I want your help.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.626
Look, you and I may be set in our ways,

20:53.794 --> 20:56.380
but these kids, they're still growing.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.632
They can learn from both of us

20:58.715 --> 21:02.135
and use what we teach them
to create their own way.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.306
I guess I didn't want that to happen
because I cared

21:07.266 --> 21:09.851
so much
about honoring Mr. Miyagi's legacy.

21:11.144 --> 21:14.064
But I forgot
one of his most important lessons.

21:14.147 --> 21:19.486
Just like bonsai choose own way grow
because root strong,

21:20.779 --> 21:23.699
you choose own way do karate, same reason.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.701
Yeah, but I do it your way.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.371
<i>Hai. </i>One day, you do own way.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.041
I was scared of the influence
you were having on Sam.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.628
But I see now

21:36.712 --> 21:38.505
some of what you teach

21:39.631 --> 21:40.841
can be good sometimes.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.929
I'm sorry I didn't realize that sooner.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.224
I'm sorry too.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.438
I saw you and Miguel bonding
and I freaked out.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.859
I was afraid of losing that connection.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.278
Now I’m paying the price for it.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.531
I shoulda just let him train with you.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.409
He would’ve been a stronger fighter.

22:10.245 --> 22:13.540
Well, since it seems the water
is flowing back under the bridge,

22:15.167 --> 22:16.752
what do you say we team up again?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.046
You want me to help Miyagi-Do win?

22:20.255 --> 22:21.089
Miyagi…

22:23.383 --> 22:24.217
…Fang.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.094
Uh, just for today.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.353
Let's do this.

22:36.396 --> 22:40.984
What better way to cap off
this exciting exhibition of karate

22:41.818 --> 22:45.030
than with a final match for the ages?

22:45.113 --> 22:47.366
Representing Cobra Kai,

22:47.449 --> 22:49.534
the Queen Cobra herself,

22:49.618 --> 22:52.120
Tory Nichols!

22:53.663 --> 22:58.085
Coached by her senseis
John Kreese and Terry Silver.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.921
And representing Miyagi-Do Karate,

23:01.004 --> 23:03.465
the Bonsai Badass,

23:03.548 --> 23:06.927
Samantha LaRusso!

23:07.469 --> 23:09.971
Coached by her father and sensei,

23:10.055 --> 23:13.058
two-time All Valley champion
Daniel LaRusso,

23:13.141 --> 23:18.897
who I've just been informed
will be joined by Sensei Johnny Lawrence.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.860
So wait--

23:27.447 --> 23:29.491
Oh, I stand corrected.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.619
Fellow two-time All Valley champion,

23:32.702 --> 23:35.330
Sensei Johnny Lawrence!

23:36.081 --> 23:36.915
Let's go!

23:40.794 --> 23:42.045
Don't worry about them.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.257
You've been fighting all your life.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.718
Now it's time
for all that struggle to pay off.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.888
Use all that fire inside you.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.223
Yes, Sensei.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.016
Hey.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.018
Good luck.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.438
Head in the game, Nichols.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.315
All right. Ready to kick some ass?

24:02.399 --> 24:03.400
Yes, Sensei.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.111
If that's okay with my other sensei?

24:06.695 --> 24:08.697
I want you to win more than anyone.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.031
Whether it's defense

24:11.241 --> 24:12.075
or offense,

24:12.159 --> 24:13.535
Miyagi-Do or Eagle Fang.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.204
I want you to be you.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.082
Just make sure
you keep your anger in check--

24:25.046 --> 24:26.882
Uh, s-sorry. You were saying?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.969
Go kick some Cobra Kai ass.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.680
Competitors, take your position.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.850
Come on, Sam.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.227
LaRusso!

24:44.149 --> 24:47.402
Ladies, good luck.
Face this way. Bow.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.738
Face each other. Bow.

24:52.073 --> 24:52.908
Ready?

24:59.414 --> 25:00.415
And fight!

25:10.050 --> 25:11.551
-Point!
-Yes!

25:12.511 --> 25:14.679
LaRusso. Score, one-zero.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.933
Holy shit!

25:18.016 --> 25:18.850
What was that?

25:19.851 --> 25:21.102
A flying tornado kick.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.523
She’s not using Miyagi-Do.
She's fighting aggressive.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.734
You get more aggressive.
I've seen what's inside you. Let it out!

25:28.610 --> 25:29.486
Come on!

25:31.321 --> 25:32.197
Ready?

25:33.448 --> 25:34.741
And fight!

25:40.789 --> 25:43.124
Point, Nichols! Score, one-one.

25:48.713 --> 25:49.631
Ready?

25:51.883 --> 25:52.717
Fight!

25:57.472 --> 25:59.432
Point! Two-one, Nichols.

26:00.141 --> 26:00.976
Damn it!

26:04.479 --> 26:07.566
I’m attacking but it’s not working.
What style should I use?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.736
Yours. Trust your instincts.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.615
Use everything you've learned from me
and Sensei Lawrence. All of it.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.492
Your dad's right.

26:18.994 --> 26:19.953
Every now and then.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.873
Come on, Sam!

26:36.886 --> 26:37.762
Ready?

26:37.846 --> 26:39.264
And fight!

26:47.939 --> 26:49.608
No point. Blocked.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.625
No point. Out of bounds.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.584
What?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.629
Come on, Ref!
She went out after she got hit!

27:11.504 --> 27:12.547
Yes!

27:18.428 --> 27:19.304
Ready?

27:21.014 --> 27:23.308
And fight!

27:34.653 --> 27:36.071
Point, LaRusso.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.622
Score’s two to two.
Next point wins. Ready?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.127
Fight!

27:53.838 --> 27:55.298
That's a block. No point!

28:19.280 --> 28:21.491
Warning. Elbow to the face.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.619
-Go to your senseis.
-Warning? Should be a point deduction!

28:24.703 --> 28:27.914
-I didn't mean to. No, it was an accident.
-Go to your senseis.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.256
-Are you all right?
-She got me good, but I can still fight.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.217
She comes in like that again,
give her a shot to the other eye.

28:39.300 --> 28:42.053
-She can’t see, she can’t fight.
-Won't I get disqualified?

28:42.137 --> 28:44.764
Why? She ran into your elbow.

28:44.848 --> 28:48.184
Do exactly what you just did,
disguise it in a counter.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.271
Worst you’ll get is another warning.
Trust me.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.524
This ref will never end the match
on a technicality.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.317
It was an accident. I don't need to cheat.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.154
<i>That's not fair.</i>
<i>I got second place.</i>

28:59.237 --> 29:01.322
<i>Second place is no place.</i>
<i>You're off the team.</i>

29:01.406 --> 29:03.283
<i>You're nothing. You lost. You're a loser.</i>

29:03.366 --> 29:04.284
-You suck.
-Yeah?

29:05.744 --> 29:06.995
Hey, come on, man!

29:08.246 --> 29:09.080
Don't!

29:09.164 --> 29:10.665
<i>Come on, who's the loser now?</i>

29:10.749 --> 29:11.624
-You suck!
-Come on!

29:11.708 --> 29:13.752
Who's the loser? I don't hear ya!

29:14.502 --> 29:16.254
Since when do you disobey an order?

29:18.006 --> 29:19.424
Let her do what she wants.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.598
You've come this far.
This is your fight now.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.141
So whatever happens,

29:28.224 --> 29:29.267
it’s up to you.

29:42.155 --> 29:42.989
Ready?

29:43.490 --> 29:44.699
And fight!

30:33.706 --> 30:34.916
Point. Winner!

30:35.875 --> 30:37.085
Hey. You all right?

30:45.718 --> 30:47.637
-What a match!
-You all right?

30:47.720 --> 30:50.849
-What a match!
-Good effort.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.269
Give it up for your first female champion,

30:54.352 --> 30:56.980
Tory Nichols!

31:00.567 --> 31:03.945
And the winner
of the Grand Champion trophy

31:04.028 --> 31:07.448
and still the baddest dojo in the Valley,

31:07.949 --> 31:09.075
Cobra Kai!

31:16.708 --> 31:18.710
Thank you. Thank you.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.379
We couldn’t be prouder

31:21.462 --> 31:22.672
of our hard-won victory.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.800
And we’re just as proud to announce

31:26.384 --> 31:30.763
we’ll soon be opening Cobra Kai franchises
throughout the entire Valley,

31:30.847 --> 31:34.058
so every one
of you young men and women here

31:34.142 --> 31:36.603
can be part of our championship dojo

31:37.896 --> 31:40.565
and learn Cobra Kai's Way of the Fist!

31:42.483 --> 31:45.361
-Thank you!
-Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai!

31:45.445 --> 31:51.910
Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai,
Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai!

31:59.542 --> 32:02.670
We did the right thing
and we still didn't win.

32:03.796 --> 32:04.923
I'm sorry.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.966
It's not your fault.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.219
Sam.

32:17.852 --> 32:18.853
Johnny.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.981
One of the parents
saw Miguel get in an Uber.

32:22.065 --> 32:22.941
What's an Uber?

32:23.524 --> 32:26.277
It's like a taxi.
He left before the finals.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.530
Shit. I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.367
I’m sure he just wants to be alone.
We’re gonna head home.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.661
Okay. You guys go. I'll meet you there.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.164
Some days I just wish
we could have a do-over.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.124
I know the feeling.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.426
Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai!

32:54.347 --> 32:56.933
Hey! Hey, victory party at my place.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.726
Queen Cobra, you coming or what?

32:58.810 --> 33:00.645
Yeah. I just gotta grab my bag.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.231
All right. Cool.
Hey, guys, let's go, let's go!

33:04.273 --> 33:07.860
Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai,
Cobra Kai, Cobra Kai!

33:15.535 --> 33:19.205
I almost thought you were gonna
back out of our deal a few times.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.082
You know what?

33:21.791 --> 33:23.084
You played it just right.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.545
No one suspects a thing.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.298
Money will be in your account
tomorrow morning.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.758
Thank you, Mr. Silver.

34:14.802 --> 34:15.845
What the hell?

34:51.798 --> 34:52.632
Robby?

34:53.716 --> 34:54.801
What's going on?

34:56.344 --> 34:57.345
I followed you.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.305
What happened here?

35:02.850 --> 35:04.102
Moving to a new location.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.064
Multiple locations, I think.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.733
You kicked ass today.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.196
-Could've gone either way.
-Yeah.

35:16.697 --> 35:17.532
Thanks.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.367
Hey.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.577
It's just a match.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.165
Don't let it eat you up. Trust me.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.251
It's not that.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.213
It's this kid,

35:33.840 --> 35:34.674
Kenny.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.971
I thought I could take him under my wing.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.225
Be the mentor
I wish I had when I was younger.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.813
But when I saw him today, it, uh…

35:53.025 --> 35:54.777
It's like looking in a mirror.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.408
I realized I screwed everything up.

36:03.786 --> 36:05.580
I had all this hate inside of me.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.457
For you and for Miguel.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.462
And I thought
I could use Cobra Kai to control that.

36:14.589 --> 36:17.592
But it just made things worse
and now it's never gonna get better.

36:17.675 --> 36:18.676
That's not true.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.723
You had a good thing going with LaRusso.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.477
I got in the way.
Don’t blame yourself. Blame me.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.898
I’m sick of blaming you, Dad.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.500
It's gonna be all right.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.422
We'll figure this out.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.467
Okay?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.933
1998 Bollinger.

37:08.142 --> 37:11.812
Been sitting in my cellar for years,
waiting for the right moment.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.732
-Not unlike yourself.
-Touché.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.568
I gotta give you credit, John.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.404
You reawakened something in me.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.449
Something I forgot was there.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.119
And I'll always be grateful for it.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.332
Told you.

37:33.542 --> 37:34.752
To Cobra Kai.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.172
The number one dojo in the Valley.

37:41.801 --> 37:42.843
I gotta say,

37:43.594 --> 37:47.056
I'm surprised you backed off on Nichols
in the finals. That's not like you.

37:48.641 --> 37:49.976
Well, what can I say?

37:50.768 --> 37:52.270
I had a moment of sympathy.

37:52.853 --> 37:53.854
That's a first.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.108
You remember

37:58.150 --> 38:00.695
when you asked me
what I thought your weakness was?

38:02.363 --> 38:03.948
It's Johnny Lawrence.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.910
That's what this was all about, right?

38:08.869 --> 38:12.123
It was never about us teaming up
or bringing back the glory days.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.582
That was all bullshit.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.585
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.337
And I fell for it.

38:19.130 --> 38:19.964
You know why?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.759
Because everyone has a weakness, John.

38:25.219 --> 38:26.053
And mine

38:26.846 --> 38:27.680
is you.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.225
You think that I'm your weakness?

38:32.768 --> 38:35.896
Well, you've got it backwards,
because I am your strength.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.774
I have been your strength
ever since Vietnam.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.068
Yes! There it is.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.572
I can always count
on you playing the guilt card.

38:45.906 --> 38:49.869
How many times do you expect me
to repay that debt before we’re square?

38:55.374 --> 38:57.043
What did you do?

38:57.543 --> 39:00.713
It’s okay, Raymond. The man
who did this can’t hurt you anymore.

39:05.426 --> 39:09.180
Give me his name and I promise you
I'll put him away for a long, long time.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.640
-You wanna be Cobra Kai, huh?
-Yes.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.810
You wanna be Cobra Kai?

39:16.896 --> 39:18.105
I'll make you Cobra Kai.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.275
But you gotta do something for me.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.405
His name is Sensei

39:27.990 --> 39:28.949
Kreese.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.077
John Kreese.

39:40.002 --> 39:42.046
I'm shedding my weakness,

39:43.172 --> 39:44.006
Captain.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.716
John Kreese, you’re under arrest

39:45.800 --> 39:48.094
for aggravated assault
and attempted murder.

39:48.177 --> 39:52.014
-You have the right to remain silent.
-John, what did you do?

39:52.098 --> 39:54.350
-Hands behind your back. Come on.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.435
-Hey!
-John, take it easy.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.728
Don’t worry about a thing.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.940
I’m sure I can dig up an old friend or two
to help out with Cobra Kai

40:01.023 --> 40:03.526
while you deal with your legal problems.

40:03.609 --> 40:04.860
You're gonna regret this.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.738
I <i>am </i>Cobra Kai.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.448
-Put him in the car!
-Move!

40:09.532 --> 40:12.660
And don’t worry about Lawrence.
I’ll take good care of him too.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.408
What's going on?

40:53.033 --> 40:53.993
Show him the note.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.170
<i>Mom, I’m sorry</i>
<i>for leaving a note like this,</i>

41:04.253 --> 41:07.089
<i>but I thought it was the best way,</i>
<i>maybe the only way,</i>

41:07.923 --> 41:09.258
<i>to say what I have to say.</i>

41:09.842 --> 41:12.178
<i>The last few months</i>
<i>have been a roller coaster.</i>

41:12.845 --> 41:13.762
<i>My injury,</i>

41:14.555 --> 41:15.389
<i>rehab,</i>

41:16.098 --> 41:17.141
<i>me and Sam,</i>

41:17.892 --> 41:19.435
<i>Sensei and Mr. LaRusso.</i>

41:20.603 --> 41:21.937
<i>I convinced myself</i>

41:22.021 --> 41:25.191
<i>that I could get over all of that</i>
<i>by focusing on the tournament.</i>

41:25.941 --> 41:28.819
<i>I thought that if I won</i>
<i>that everything would work out.</i>

41:30.112 --> 41:31.197
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

41:32.114 --> 41:34.033
<i>Tell Sensei that I'm sorry I bailed.</i>

41:34.783 --> 41:38.370
<i>His karate helped me grow,</i>
<i>but I'm still not sure who I wanna be.</i>

41:39.538 --> 41:42.750
<i>And to figure that out, I think</i>
<i>I need to know where I came from.</i>

41:43.375 --> 41:46.337
<i>Sensei was scared</i>
<i>to find out the truth about his past,</i>

41:46.420 --> 41:48.714
<i>and honestly, I am too.</i>

41:49.715 --> 41:53.010
<i>But overcoming that fear</i>
<i>is the fight I have to face</i>

41:53.093 --> 41:54.845
<i>instead of competing for a trophy.</i>

41:55.679 --> 41:57.139
<i>I need to meet my father.</i>

41:57.640 --> 41:59.225
<i>This is something I have to do.</i>

41:59.725 --> 42:01.685
<i>Please try not to worry.</i>

42:02.269 --> 42:04.104
<i>I'll be safe and I'll be back soon.</i>

42:05.022 --> 42:07.233
<i>I love you, Mom. And Yaya too.</i>

42:10.236 --> 42:13.322
I called the police.
I-I don't know what else to do.

42:13.405 --> 42:15.157
Everything's gonna be fine.

42:16.659 --> 42:18.869
I'm gonna find him.
I'll make sure he's safe.

42:19.703 --> 42:20.538
Johnny.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.627
There's something
I didn't tell you about my ex-husband.

42:26.710 --> 42:30.714
I know. You said he's a bad dude.
Don't worry. I can handle myself.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.468
-And I'm sure he'd never hurt his own son.
-That's just it.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.763
He doesn't know Miguel exists.

42:40.558 --> 42:44.478
I just want my baby back home safe.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.646
I'll make sure of it.

42:46.564 --> 42:47.648
All right? I promise.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.742
I did everything
I thought was right.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.037
I followed all of the Miyagi-Do teachings.

43:03.539 --> 43:06.417
I even put aside my rivalry
and teamed up with Johnny.

43:07.668 --> 43:08.711
None of it worked.

43:11.297 --> 43:14.508
Now I'm supposed to give up my dojo
and step down as a sensei.

43:17.344 --> 43:18.846
But there's too much at stake

43:18.929 --> 43:21.390
to honor an agreement
made with men who have none.

43:22.975 --> 43:26.103
If Cobra Kai is gonna keep growing
and getting stronger,

43:26.186 --> 43:28.355
I need to do whatever it takes
to stop them.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.610
Even if that means going on offense.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.488
I know this isn't your fight

43:37.740 --> 43:39.116
and this is a lot to ask…

43:41.827 --> 43:42.953
but will you help me

43:44.163 --> 43:46.123
finally put an end to Cobra Kai?
