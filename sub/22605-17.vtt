WEBVTT

00:05.421 --> 00:07.822
(sirens wailing in distance)

00:12.461 --> 00:14.829
(explosions in distance)

00:20.135 --> 00:21.770
(alarm beeping)

00:21.771 --> 00:23.138
(alarm stops)

00:23.139 --> 00:25.539
(gunfire in distance)

00:27.476 --> 00:30.479
(indistinct shouting)

00:30.480 --> 00:32.414
(gunfire continues)

00:32.415 --> 00:35.818
MAN: You're off to a good start.

00:35.819 --> 00:37.986
(gunfire continues over TV)

00:37.987 --> 00:40.689
Jason, why don't you turn that off now?

00:40.690 --> 00:42.758
- Come on, come get some breakfast.
- JASON: All right, let me...

00:42.759 --> 00:44.460
- That's enough carnage for 7:00 a.m.
- All right, let me save it.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.594
- Hold on.
- Uh, oh, I'll save it for you.

00:45.595 --> 00:46.695
JASON: Well...

00:46.696 --> 00:47.863
Dad... come on.

00:47.864 --> 00:49.398
(laughs) Come on, let's go.

00:49.399 --> 00:51.266
Hey, don't act like you got
some big problem with my game.

00:51.267 --> 00:52.367
You play it, too. Okay.

00:52.368 --> 00:53.969
- Aah!
- Oh, come on!

00:53.970 --> 00:55.237
- Breakfast.
- Oh.

00:55.238 --> 00:57.072
The discovery of hypocrisy.

00:57.073 --> 01:00.242
Bitter moment in any young
revolutionary's life.

01:00.243 --> 01:02.344
Well, kid's got a point, but,
uh, when he's not telling me

01:02.345 --> 01:03.912
how much I suck at
this game, he actually

01:03.913 --> 01:05.480
sometimes tells me
something about his life.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.783
- Right.
- Hey, you okay?

01:07.784 --> 01:09.284
Yeah, I'm good.

01:09.285 --> 01:11.353
'Cause you've been just going nonstop

01:11.354 --> 01:12.821
since you got back from Iran.

01:12.822 --> 01:15.157
Oh, I'm a little jetlagged
still, but I'm good.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.191
I'm fine.

01:16.192 --> 01:19.128
Promise.

01:19.129 --> 01:21.430
I'm just saying, going
back to school is gonna be

01:21.431 --> 01:23.398
a big adjustment after
lying around here all day,

01:23.399 --> 01:24.733
- playing video games.
- Yeah.

01:24.734 --> 01:26.401
Yeah, you should know, dropout.

01:26.402 --> 01:28.403
- Oh, burn!
- Ooh!

01:28.404 --> 01:29.274
Good comeback, Padawan.

01:29.275 --> 01:30.906
ALISON: You know that
if you get kicked out

01:30.907 --> 01:31.671
of two schools in a row,

01:31.672 --> 01:33.242
you have to go to
military school, right?

01:33.243 --> 01:34.443
It's, like, the law.

01:34.444 --> 01:35.878
- Hey, I could handle military school.
- Yeah, right.

01:35.879 --> 01:37.741
Okay, wait. What about,
uh, home-schooling, pal?

01:37.742 --> 01:38.680
Uh, I'll stick with public school.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.449
Oh, come on. Just
think of it. You and me

01:40.450 --> 01:42.784
studying all these great books,

01:42.785 --> 01:44.386
spending hours having
philosophical discussions.

01:44.387 --> 01:45.521
Mm. Shoot me now.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.288
Jason.

01:46.289 --> 01:48.089
JASON: What did I say?

01:49.558 --> 01:52.728
Well, I'm-I'm glad that you're
on board with public school,

01:52.729 --> 01:54.563
because that is where you're going.

01:54.564 --> 01:57.166
Oh, we have that-that,
uh, orientation meeting

01:57.167 --> 01:58.667
- at 11:00, okay?
- Yeah, I know.

01:58.668 --> 02:00.636
Listen, um, I cleared my
schedule out this morning.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.337
You want to take the time off?
Maybe we can go...

02:02.338 --> 02:03.605
I can't. I've got meetings.

02:03.606 --> 02:04.706
Then I've got

02:04.707 --> 02:07.342
meetings after those
meetings, so I got to go.

02:07.343 --> 02:08.810
- Bye, guys.
- ALISON: Bye, Mom.

02:08.811 --> 02:10.179
- Love you.
- STEVIE: Bye, Mom. Love you.

02:10.180 --> 02:11.246
Bye. Ow.

02:11.247 --> 02:12.414
- Nice sensitivity, dumb-ass.
- What...? Dad!

02:12.415 --> 02:13.916
Okay, cut it out, both of you.

02:13.917 --> 02:16.618
NADINE: <i>The desk officer
is waiting to brief you</i>

02:16.619 --> 02:17.753
on your first meeting.

02:17.754 --> 02:19.555
- Ecuador?
- Yes, ma'am.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.757
And Matt and Daisy are here

02:21.758 --> 02:23.625
to have a word with you this morning.

02:23.626 --> 02:25.060
Yes, I'm getting that.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.795
Ma'am, we need to prep you
for <i>Face The Nation.</i>

02:26.796 --> 02:27.963
Can't this morning.

02:27.964 --> 02:29.665
I got a thing at my son's school.

02:29.666 --> 02:31.767
Well, you've been at the center
of everything that's happened.

02:31.768 --> 02:33.802
Unearthing Director Munsey's plot,

02:33.803 --> 02:35.037
thwarting the coup in Iran.

02:35.038 --> 02:36.672
The White House wants
you front and center

02:36.673 --> 02:38.440
to reassure the public
that everything is okay.

02:38.441 --> 02:40.809
- Well, is it? News to me.
- This...

02:40.810 --> 02:44.346
The point is, ma'am, I mean,
if there's a hero in this story,

02:44.347 --> 02:46.048
- it's you.
- What did you just say?

02:46.049 --> 02:47.649
Because what I thought

02:47.650 --> 02:50.219
you said is that I'm the
hero of this story?

02:50.220 --> 02:51.853
Excuse me, ma'am. Daisy
didn't mean to imply...

02:51.854 --> 02:53.288
Excuse me, Nadine.

02:53.289 --> 02:55.591
See, what's confusing

02:55.592 --> 02:58.126
is how you could possibly
say something like that,

02:58.127 --> 03:01.630
just days after you attended
Fred Cole's funeral.

03:01.631 --> 03:04.800
Man who literally threw
himself in front of bullets

03:04.801 --> 03:06.368
to save me.

03:06.369 --> 03:09.338
Which is the very definition of heroism.

03:09.339 --> 03:11.073
You come at me with this

03:11.074 --> 03:14.476
win-the-cycle crap again,
it'll be the last time you do.

03:14.477 --> 03:16.211
You understand?

03:16.212 --> 03:19.180
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

03:20.816 --> 03:23.952
Why is there a nurse in my waiting area?

03:23.953 --> 03:25.954
Oh, she's here to follow up

03:25.955 --> 03:27.856
on the exam you received at Landstuhl.

03:27.857 --> 03:30.559
You kept rescheduling, so I had
someone from Walter Reed

03:30.560 --> 03:32.361
- sent over.
- I had said I would go

03:32.362 --> 03:34.296
- to my own doctor when I had time.
- Mm-hmm.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.031
They needed a follow-up ASAP, ma'am.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.299
It's literally doctor's orders.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.334
Et tu, Blake?

03:39.335 --> 03:42.170
NURSE: <i>You're healing
well, Madam Secretary.</i>

03:42.171 --> 03:44.539
Stitches should be ready
to come out in a few days.

03:44.540 --> 03:45.574
Fantastic.

03:45.575 --> 03:47.342
Are you having any pain, ma'am?

03:47.343 --> 03:49.044
Nope. None.

03:49.045 --> 03:51.747
Then, um, I just need
to draw your blood.

03:51.748 --> 03:54.549
Well, I'm on a tight schedule.

03:54.550 --> 03:58.420
I hope you don't mind if I multitask.

03:58.421 --> 04:00.656
So, what does the CEO

04:00.657 --> 04:03.625
of one of America's biggest
oil companies want

04:03.626 --> 04:05.761
from a peon like the Secretary of State?

04:05.762 --> 04:07.429
Chip Harding is here because he believes

04:07.430 --> 04:09.531
you should be doing more
to help Ashmont Petroleum

04:09.532 --> 04:11.333
secure drilling rights in Ecuador,

04:11.334 --> 04:12.467
as opposed to the Chinese.

04:12.468 --> 04:13.602
ELIZABETH: But the proposed

04:13.603 --> 04:15.704
area of the Amazon is highly sensitive,

04:15.705 --> 04:17.539
which is what our desk officer

04:17.540 --> 04:19.341
for the region is here to discuss.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.942
It's Laura, right?

04:20.942 --> 04:22.911
(clears throat) Uh, yes, ma'am.

04:22.912 --> 04:26.448
Let me first say how thrilled
I am to finally meet you in...

04:26.449 --> 04:28.116
person.

04:28.117 --> 04:29.651
Uh,

04:29.652 --> 04:31.486
you okay there, Laura?

04:31.487 --> 04:34.489
Yeah. Just have a little thing about, um...

04:34.490 --> 04:36.525
blood. Um...

04:36.526 --> 04:38.527
- Oh.
- Very sorry, but I'm fine.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.861
Quite all right.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.997
Why don't we just get right to it, then?

04:41.998 --> 04:43.699
Yes, ma'am. As you may have read

04:43.700 --> 04:45.934
in your briefing book, the
Selva Region of eastern Ecuador

04:45.935 --> 04:48.136
is one of the most bio-diverse
areas of the Amazon,

04:48.137 --> 04:49.304
and indeed the world.

04:49.305 --> 04:50.572
MIKE: Home to... count them...

04:50.573 --> 04:53.508
ten primate species,
including the rare Titi monkey.

04:53.509 --> 04:55.577
- There's an image for you.
- LAURA: Developing it

04:55.578 --> 04:57.346
would be extremely damaging to the

04:57.347 --> 05:01.549
local... um... but also...

05:04.319 --> 05:06.988
But also, it is important to remember

05:06.989 --> 05:09.925
that the Amazon is the
world's carbon sink

05:09.926 --> 05:12.527
where much of the CO2
we produce is absorbed

05:12.528 --> 05:14.129
by the trees of...

05:14.130 --> 05:15.397
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, God.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.432
So embarrassed. Excuse me, ma'am.

05:17.433 --> 05:18.867
(mutters)

05:18.868 --> 05:20.402
- Okay.
- MIKE: Hope she makes it

05:20.403 --> 05:22.104
to the porcelain sink in time.

05:22.105 --> 05:24.840
Why don't you go see if she's okay.

05:24.841 --> 05:27.476
Right, the point being, if a
tract this big is developed,

05:27.477 --> 05:31.079
it will speed up the
deforestation process,

05:31.080 --> 05:32.781
which will ultimately lead to what?

05:32.782 --> 05:34.082
Ocean acidification, species die-offs,

05:34.083 --> 05:36.918
larger and more unpredictable
weather events,

05:36.919 --> 05:38.520
increased climate-driven
conflicts and refugees.

05:38.521 --> 05:39.888
You know, your typical

05:39.889 --> 05:41.790
21st century end-of-the-world buffet.

05:41.791 --> 05:42.891
Got it.

05:42.892 --> 05:44.526
LAURA: Sorry. False alarm.

05:44.527 --> 05:47.262
Ma'am, there are more tree
species in a single hectare

05:47.263 --> 05:49.731
of the Selva region than
in all of North America.

05:49.732 --> 05:51.600
If there's a cure for cancer or HIV,

05:51.601 --> 05:52.734
we will probably find it there.

05:52.735 --> 05:54.169
MIKE: Counterpoint.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.505
Chip Harding donates millions
of dollars each election cycle,

05:56.506 --> 05:58.740
which will either be used for or against

05:58.741 --> 05:59.875
your president.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.243
Just something to weigh against

06:01.244 --> 06:02.344
the sad monkeys and magic trees.

06:02.345 --> 06:03.912
And it is part of our job

06:03.913 --> 06:05.080
to promote U.S. businesses abroad,

06:05.081 --> 06:06.815
but if we want to have a
voice in the decision,

06:06.816 --> 06:08.150
we need to act now.

06:08.151 --> 06:09.951
The Ecuadorians are
planning whether to develop

06:09.952 --> 06:11.553
the Selva within a month.

06:11.554 --> 06:13.388
Oh, plenty of time.

06:13.389 --> 06:16.790
All right, why don't we go see
what we can do for Mr. Harding.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.862
Ma'am.

06:22.898 --> 06:25.100
- Oh!
- Oh. Have fun.

06:25.101 --> 06:26.301
I got it. I got it.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.437
Okay. What are you even doing here?

06:28.438 --> 06:29.938
I'm attending your meeting with Chip...

06:29.939 --> 06:31.139
Chip Harding, ma'am.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.941
Okay, isn't Abby about to
go into labor any second?

06:32.942 --> 06:34.676
- Literally any second.
- So, go, go.

06:34.677 --> 06:36.745
I can handle Harding by myself.

06:36.746 --> 06:38.847
If I need more information,
I'll get it from Laura back...

06:38.848 --> 06:40.348
Brilliant, and she really
wanted to make an impression.

06:40.349 --> 06:41.783
Oh, she did. It's all set.

06:41.784 --> 06:43.051
- Go right now.
- Here.

06:43.052 --> 06:44.986
- Okay. There you go.
- Oh, there. Thank you.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.922
Tell Abby to get the epidural early!

06:46.923 --> 06:47.956
You got it!

06:47.957 --> 06:49.591
Key word: early.

06:49.592 --> 06:54.062
Madam Secretary, I'm busy,
and I'm sure you are, too,

06:54.063 --> 06:55.897
so I'll get straight to the point.

06:55.898 --> 06:57.032
I would love it

06:57.033 --> 06:59.501
if the government would
just get out of our way.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.536
Or better yet, help us out for once.

07:01.537 --> 07:02.871
There's a concept.

07:02.872 --> 07:05.006
What is it that you
feel isn't being done

07:05.007 --> 07:06.608
for the oil industry, Mr. Harding?

07:06.609 --> 07:08.610
The SEC and Justice are
breathing down our neck

07:08.611 --> 07:10.779
about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

07:10.780 --> 07:13.615
Do take a dim view of bribing
foreign officials, yes.

07:13.616 --> 07:16.017
Come on, you know full
well that that's the way

07:16.018 --> 07:18.053
business gets done in
places like Ecuador.

07:18.054 --> 07:19.588
And let me tell you something.

07:19.589 --> 07:21.089
The Chinese aren't wringing their hands

07:21.090 --> 07:22.257
about doing business.

07:22.258 --> 07:24.125
Given that I can't help
you bribe anybody,

07:24.126 --> 07:26.461
what exactly would you like
the State Department to do?

07:26.462 --> 07:27.596
Offer them aid.

07:27.597 --> 07:29.598
Help in developing vital infrastructure.

07:29.599 --> 07:30.966
We do give them aid.

07:30.967 --> 07:35.303
$218 million last year, to
be exact, but it does come

07:35.304 --> 07:37.739
with anti-corruption
safeguards built in.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.409
So, sorry if that's not helping
you grease the wheels.

07:41.410 --> 07:43.712
Look, the Selva's too
valuable not to be developed.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.913
That's just the facts.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.147
Who do you and the president

07:46.148 --> 07:47.616
prefer to see do it... us or the Chinese?

07:47.617 --> 07:49.017
I guarantee you we care

07:49.018 --> 07:52.420
very deeply about what happens
in the Selva region, and I will

07:52.421 --> 07:54.789
bear your concerns in mind when I meet

07:54.790 --> 07:55.991
with the Ecuadorian ambassador.

07:55.992 --> 07:58.592
Thank you so much for coming in.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.335
A great game is afoot, Madam Secretary,

08:07.336 --> 08:10.872
and we can't win it with one
hand tied behind our back.

08:10.873 --> 08:13.308
I hope the president understands that.

08:13.309 --> 08:15.510
Thank you for your time.

08:15.511 --> 08:18.346
You bet.

08:18.347 --> 08:20.382
Everyone okay?

08:20.383 --> 08:23.418
Well, it's not like we have hurt feelies.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.086
Although, that was quite an outburst.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.022
I understand she's been through a lot,

08:27.023 --> 08:29.682
but the fact is, she needs
to prep for <i>Face the Nation.</i>

08:29.683 --> 08:32.126
I'll try to block out some time in
her schedule for this afternoon.

08:32.128 --> 08:34.195
MATT: It's not like we're
being overly dramatic.

08:34.196 --> 08:35.597
Rogue CIA director

08:35.597 --> 08:37.631
starts a coup in Iran under
the White House's nose?

08:37.633 --> 08:39.534
And the only reason it fails is because

08:39.534 --> 08:41.102
she literally puts herself
in the line of fire.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.804
That's a huge story.

08:42.804 --> 08:43.738
Huge.

08:43.739 --> 08:44.873
I'm aware.

08:44.874 --> 08:45.974
And so is the public, but they haven't

08:45.975 --> 08:47.609
seen her since the
funerals three days ago.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.178
And the longer they don't, the
more she's gonna be pulled

08:50.179 --> 08:51.713
into the morass of suspicion and blame.

08:51.714 --> 08:54.649
She needs to tell her story,
and she can't just wing it.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.418
WOMAN: <i>As it says</i>

08:56.419 --> 08:59.154
in your packet, drop-off is
between 7:30 and 7:50,

08:59.155 --> 09:01.189
but there can be a bit of a
line sometimes, so it's worth

09:01.190 --> 09:03.301
- getting here early.
- HENRY: Maybe if we had a different kid.

09:03.302 --> 09:05.060
(woman laughs)

09:05.061 --> 09:06.661
Well, that covers it.

09:06.662 --> 09:08.163
Welcome to Monroe Junior High.

09:08.164 --> 09:12.434
I'd like to revisit the
security issue if I may.

09:12.435 --> 09:13.802
Uh, of course.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.938
Uh, as I mentioned,

09:16.939 --> 09:18.707
student safety is our
number one priority.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.041
We have two full-time

09:20.042 --> 09:22.811
security officers, metal
detectors at every entrance

09:22.812 --> 09:25.513
and a zero-tolerance policy
on weapons and bullying.

09:25.514 --> 09:28.316
Jason will be in good
hands here, Mrs. McCord.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.451
I'm sure he will be.

09:29.452 --> 09:31.086
ELIZABETH: The thing is, I'm not.

09:31.087 --> 09:33.722
I'd like to provide Jason
with a security detail.

09:33.723 --> 09:35.523
- HENRY: Wait. What?
- No, no.

09:35.524 --> 09:37.359
Nothing obtrusive, just one man.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.295
Given who I am and what I do,
I feel that it's necessary.

09:40.296 --> 09:41.363
Will you

09:41.364 --> 09:42.430
excuse us for one minute?

09:42.431 --> 09:43.598
Absolutely.

09:43.599 --> 09:45.634
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

09:45.635 --> 09:46.935
Just what I said.

09:46.936 --> 09:49.638
I think Jason needs extra security.

09:49.639 --> 09:50.772
Well, the threat assessment guys

09:50.773 --> 09:52.340
at Diplomatic Security
don't think he does.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.875
- Well, I'm their boss.
- Not when it comes

09:53.876 --> 09:55.777
to assigning a security
detail, you're not.

09:55.778 --> 09:58.279
Besides, you said you wanted
Jason to have as normal

09:58.280 --> 10:00.248
a school experience
as possible, as did I.

10:00.249 --> 10:01.383
We settled this.

10:01.384 --> 10:02.984
I am fourth in line for the presidency

10:02.985 --> 10:04.653
of the United States.

10:04.654 --> 10:06.888
He doesn't get to be a normal child.

10:06.889 --> 10:09.190
Okay. Is this about
what happened in Iran?

10:09.191 --> 10:10.425
No.

10:10.426 --> 10:12.460
Because if you want to talk
to me, then, please...

10:12.461 --> 10:14.761
Why can't you just back me up on this?

10:21.970 --> 10:24.371
Okay.

10:26.374 --> 10:27.642
I'll tell you what.

10:27.643 --> 10:28.877
I will call Diplomatic Security

10:28.878 --> 10:31.279
and have them send me over
a couple of candidates.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.014
How's that?

10:33.015 --> 10:35.415
Thank you.

10:37.752 --> 10:42.122
I have to get back to work,
so I'll see you tonight.

11:05.511 --> 11:07.413
Professor McCord?

11:07.414 --> 11:10.015
I'm thinking you're the bodyguard.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.190
Uh, call me Henry.

11:11.191 --> 11:13.524
- Come on in.
- Kevin Boyd.

11:16.162 --> 11:17.922
HENRY: <i>You got quite a resume.</i>

11:17.923 --> 11:19.724
Six years doing security at State.

11:19.725 --> 11:22.160
Before that, ten years as
a recon Marine. Oorah.

11:22.161 --> 11:25.864
Yes, sir. Forcecon, 2nd
Division out of Lejeune.

11:25.865 --> 11:27.599
You serve in the Corps?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.701
Third MAW out of Miramar.
I flew Hornets in Desert Storm.

11:29.702 --> 11:31.870
- You know, the original.
- Oorah, sir.

11:31.871 --> 11:34.139
I did a couple tours
in the sequel myself.

11:34.140 --> 11:36.537
Ah, but the question is, has all
your extensive combat experience

11:36.538 --> 11:38.706
prepared you to take a
13-year-old to middle school?

11:38.707 --> 11:41.775
Let's just say, no one will be
taking Jason's milk money.

11:41.776 --> 11:43.877
(chuckles) I'm gonna be honest with you.

11:43.878 --> 11:46.280
This is really less about
an actual security threat

11:46.281 --> 11:48.048
and more about an abundance of caution.

11:48.049 --> 11:50.917
Peace of mind. Copy that, sir.

11:51.552 --> 11:53.520
Let me ask you something.

11:53.521 --> 11:56.290
You saw a lot of action,
so I'm sure you know guys

11:56.291 --> 11:57.858
that came back with issues, yeah?

11:57.859 --> 11:59.827
- You mean PTSD?
- Yeah.

11:59.828 --> 12:02.396
In-in your experience,
how did that manifest?

12:02.397 --> 12:05.866
Well, due respect, sir,
with your experience,

12:05.867 --> 12:08.402
you must have seen
a fair share yourself.

12:08.403 --> 12:11.171
My buddies and I were dropping
ordinance from 30,000 feet.

12:11.172 --> 12:13.140
Now, that's a thing,
but it ain't Fallujah.

12:13.141 --> 12:15.409
I'm just curious how it looked to you.

12:15.410 --> 12:19.380
Well, a lot of guys don't sleep,
temper's on a hair-trigger,

12:19.381 --> 12:21.448
usually they're having flashbacks,

12:21.449 --> 12:23.150
they're hyper-vigilant.

12:23.151 --> 12:24.585
I got a buddy,

12:24.586 --> 12:26.353
can't drive anymore.

12:26.354 --> 12:27.955
Thinks every piece of trash he sees

12:27.956 --> 12:29.890
lying in the gutter is hiding an IED.

12:29.891 --> 12:32.559
Yeah, there's not much you can
do, besides be there for them.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.328
You can try to get them help,

12:34.329 --> 12:37.398
but they're not gonna talk
until they're ready, so...

12:37.399 --> 12:40.934
But just so we're crystal clear
here, sir, I don't have...

12:40.935 --> 12:42.002
Oh, I... I trust you.

12:42.003 --> 12:44.705
Hey, listen, the job is
yours if you want it.

12:44.706 --> 12:47.941
I'm just concerned you're a
little too inconspicuous.

12:47.942 --> 12:50.544
That's usually the deal-breaker.

12:50.545 --> 12:52.346
ELIZABETH: <i>I am meeting with
the Ecuadorian Ambassador</i>

12:52.347 --> 12:54.081
<i>in five minutes. What don't I know?</i>

12:54.082 --> 12:56.116
International conservation
groups have a plan

12:56.117 --> 12:57.751
that would pay Ecuador to turn

12:57.752 --> 13:00.954
the entire Selva Region
into a protected preserve.

13:00.955 --> 13:04.291
So, essentially, they would bribe Ecuador

13:04.292 --> 13:06.293
not to despoil its own rainforest?

13:06.294 --> 13:08.095
That's the idea, ma'am, yes.

13:08.096 --> 13:09.863
And the Ecuadorians have actually

13:09.864 --> 13:11.732
been receptive to the plan.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.700
Well, who doesn't like a bribe?

13:13.701 --> 13:15.502
Okay, but?

13:15.503 --> 13:18.238
So far, no one's been inclined
to kick in the start-up costs,

13:18.239 --> 13:19.506
which are in the low billions.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.141
Especially when the
potential oil revenues

13:21.142 --> 13:22.709
could be a hundred times that.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.578
So what are you pitching me?

13:24.579 --> 13:26.213
Ah...

13:26.214 --> 13:28.382
You want us to do
nothing with the Selva?

13:28.383 --> 13:30.150
Not nothing, Ambassador Calderon.

13:30.151 --> 13:31.885
I'm suggesting that you move forward

13:31.886 --> 13:34.321
with the plan to turn it
into a protected preserve.

13:34.322 --> 13:36.523
(laughs): Please. Your current Congress

13:36.524 --> 13:38.892
would never allot such a large sum

13:38.893 --> 13:40.527
for rainforest conservation.

13:40.528 --> 13:44.364
Maybe coca eradication,
but let's ask our neighbors,

13:44.365 --> 13:46.800
the Colombians, how that's
working out for the environment.

13:46.801 --> 13:48.168
I know it's a stretch,

13:48.169 --> 13:50.337
and, obviously, there
are some trust issues.

13:50.338 --> 13:52.239
To put it mildly.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.674
We're still cleaning up oil spills

13:53.675 --> 13:56.677
American companies caused in the 1970s.

13:56.678 --> 13:59.112
But if I could get the money,
which I am working on right now,

13:59.113 --> 14:01.648
would your government consider
preserving the entirety

14:01.649 --> 14:04.050
of the Selva Region?

14:05.586 --> 14:07.688
If you could match the Chinese offer,

14:07.689 --> 14:10.023
perhaps.

14:10.024 --> 14:11.625
But you can't.

14:11.626 --> 14:15.395
And certainly not within
a plausible time frame.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.198
So, and with all due
respect, Madam Secretary,

14:18.199 --> 14:20.434
we stick with the Chinese.

14:20.435 --> 14:23.370
They're not your friends, you know.

14:23.371 --> 14:24.738
(laughs)

14:24.739 --> 14:27.707
But then... they don't pretend to be.

14:28.842 --> 14:30.410
MATT (like Bob Schieffer):
Madam Secretary,

14:30.411 --> 14:32.746
welcome to <i>Face the Nation.</i>

14:32.747 --> 14:35.249
Thank you, pretend Bob Schieffer.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.050
NADINE: Matt,

14:37.051 --> 14:38.519
not so much with the voice.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.220
- Come on.
- DAISY: Oh, but he's

14:40.221 --> 14:41.455
so sadly proud of it.

14:41.456 --> 14:44.458
Fine. Your loss.

14:44.459 --> 14:46.460
(normal voice): Madam Secretary,

14:46.461 --> 14:48.595
recent events paint a troubling picture

14:48.596 --> 14:50.430
of the Dalton Administration.

14:50.431 --> 14:54.034
Should America be worried about
this president's leadership?

14:54.035 --> 14:55.802
Not at all.

14:55.803 --> 14:58.171
Andrew Munsey was a very capable spy.

14:58.172 --> 15:00.741
He managed to hide his traitorous acts

15:00.742 --> 15:02.242
for quite some time.

15:02.243 --> 15:04.511
But the moment the
president learned of them,

15:04.512 --> 15:06.313
he leapt into action

15:06.314 --> 15:08.916
and saved the nation, and the world,

15:08.917 --> 15:10.417
from a dangerous fate.

15:10.418 --> 15:13.053
MATT: Well, some would
argue that you did that,

15:13.054 --> 15:16.189
first by uncovering the
conspiracy, and second

15:16.190 --> 15:19.960
by your unprecedented trip to Iran.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.328
Come on, he's not gonna ask that.

15:21.329 --> 15:23.330
DAISY: Oh, well,

15:23.331 --> 15:27.000
it's a fair interpretation
of the facts, ma'am.

15:27.001 --> 15:29.001
Uh, fine.

15:30.671 --> 15:32.037
(clears throat)

15:33.473 --> 15:35.976
While I was glad to do my part,

15:35.977 --> 15:38.378
the fact that we are
now on the other side

15:38.379 --> 15:42.749
of a constitutional and
global crisis is a testament

15:42.750 --> 15:45.017
to our president's
courageous leadership.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.288
Madam Secretary, you were present

15:48.289 --> 15:51.325
when Iranian Foreign
Minister Javani was killed,

15:51.326 --> 15:53.293
along with several others.

15:53.294 --> 15:54.962
Yeah. Yes, I was.

15:54.963 --> 15:58.298
Tell me about that horrifying scene.

15:58.299 --> 16:00.133
Who was there with you,

16:00.134 --> 16:02.002
and-and what happened?

16:02.003 --> 16:04.538
(ears ringing)

16:04.539 --> 16:06.607
(gunfire, explosions in distance)

16:06.608 --> 16:09.875
(ears ringing louder)

16:11.845 --> 16:13.981
(explosion, indistinct shouting)

16:13.982 --> 16:16.049
(gunfire)

16:16.050 --> 16:18.352
- Abdol!
- (gunfire continues)

16:18.353 --> 16:20.820
(shouting)

16:22.856 --> 16:25.724
Abdol, stay down!

16:27.194 --> 16:29.662
NADINE: Ma'am?

16:30.797 --> 16:32.231
Ma'am?

16:34.868 --> 16:38.205
Want to give me that again?

16:38.206 --> 16:40.340
- Uh, sure.
- NADINE: Um, you know what?

16:40.341 --> 16:43.677
Why don't we take a break? Okay?

16:43.678 --> 16:46.078
Yup.

16:48.582 --> 16:49.916
(sighs) What the hell was that?

16:49.917 --> 16:51.718
It's five seconds of dead air.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.120
Well, arguably, that was a
little more than that, Daisy.

16:56.723 --> 16:58.725
I understand that, but whatever it was,

16:58.726 --> 17:00.661
it wasn't exactly the
image of calm stability

17:00.662 --> 17:02.596
the White House is looking to project.

17:02.597 --> 17:04.564
I think we should cancel.
We can't risk her

17:04.565 --> 17:05.999
having an incident
like that on television.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.267
You want to tell her that?

17:07.268 --> 17:09.970
Call the show, make
her appearance subject

17:09.971 --> 17:11.171
to availability.

17:11.172 --> 17:12.906
We'll take another run at this tomorrow.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.508
If she's still tentative,

17:14.509 --> 17:16.576
we've laid the groundwork
for a postponement.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.444
- On it.
- Okay.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.481
(water splashing)

17:21.482 --> 17:23.416
(ears ringing, explosions in distance)

17:23.417 --> 17:25.152
(man shouting)

17:25.153 --> 17:27.519
(panting slowly)

17:34.628 --> 17:36.963
ELIZABETH: <i>Jason, this is</i>

17:36.964 --> 17:38.896
- about your safety.
- JASON: Yeah, well, then I'll be safe

17:38.897 --> 17:40.233
at home, because I'm not going.

17:40.234 --> 17:41.868
You guys can't just spring this on me.

17:41.869 --> 17:44.071
You said I'd be a normal
kid at a normal school.

17:44.072 --> 17:45.772
- This isn't fair!
- And yet, this is happening,

17:45.773 --> 17:47.808
so I need you to get your
stuff and get on board.

17:47.809 --> 17:49.287
Kevin, can we have a
couple minutes, please?

17:49.288 --> 17:51.099
Of course.

17:53.513 --> 17:55.749
- Jason, grab your stuff.
- No, no, Dad, I'm not...

17:55.750 --> 17:57.583
Just do it, son.

18:02.889 --> 18:05.124
- I love you.
- Uh-huh.

18:05.992 --> 18:08.929
(sighs)

18:08.930 --> 18:11.465
Well, he's right, babe. It isn't fair.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.200
- Well, life isn't fair.
- Huh.

18:13.201 --> 18:15.035
- In this house, it is.
- I knew it.

18:15.036 --> 18:16.470
I knew you would
make me the bad guy.

18:16.471 --> 18:20.741
And then, you had to pick, like,
the biggest guy on the planet

18:20.742 --> 18:22.442
just to push all of Jason's buttons.

18:22.443 --> 18:24.911
Okay, look, I know that you
have been through a lot,

18:24.912 --> 18:26.813
and that you don't
want to talk about it.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.116
- Don't psychoanalyze me.
- But maybe that's behind

18:29.117 --> 18:30.817
your sudden obsession
with Jason's security...

18:30.818 --> 18:32.552
And don't condescend to me, Henry!

18:32.553 --> 18:34.454
- We don't talk to each other that way.
- If you had seen

18:34.455 --> 18:36.156
what I've seen, you would want him

18:36.157 --> 18:37.524
to have protection, too, okay?

18:37.525 --> 18:38.859
He doesn't need it.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.428
So, we either keep our word
and let him go to school

18:41.429 --> 18:42.629
without security, or he stays home.

18:42.630 --> 18:44.197
Okay, so it's okay for
you not to fight fair.

18:44.198 --> 18:46.433
Is that how we do it now? Is that it?

18:46.434 --> 18:48.401
On this one, yeah. We're not
gonna let your issues...

18:48.402 --> 18:49.870
- My issues?!
- ...force Jason

18:49.871 --> 18:51.037
to be treated unfairly.

18:51.038 --> 18:53.806
- What are my issues?
- Are you ready to talk?

18:55.041 --> 18:58.010
Let's talk.

18:59.579 --> 19:02.449
Fine. I don't have
time for this. You win.

19:02.450 --> 19:04.850
Okay?

19:07.988 --> 19:10.228
And the Italian embassy
wants to honor you

19:10.229 --> 19:12.164
with a dinner on the 24th.

19:12.165 --> 19:15.400
Well, it's worth saying
yes just for the food.

19:15.401 --> 19:18.170
What's this, uh, "subject
to availability" BS

19:18.171 --> 19:20.105
- I'm hearing?
- Russell Jackson, ma'am.

19:20.106 --> 19:22.074
Thanks for the heads-up,
Blake. Uh, which BS

19:22.075 --> 19:23.914
- is that, Russell?
- <i>Face The Nation.</i>

19:23.915 --> 19:25.110
You put a pin in your appearance.

19:25.111 --> 19:26.244
I was wondering why.

19:26.245 --> 19:29.347
Well, since this is the first time

19:29.348 --> 19:32.150
I'm hearing about it, so would I.

19:32.151 --> 19:34.453
I thought it would be better

19:34.454 --> 19:36.455
to leave some flexibility there, ma'am.

19:36.456 --> 19:37.822
JACKSON: Why?

19:37.823 --> 19:39.356
Hey, you don't get

19:39.357 --> 19:42.026
to interrogate my staff, Russell.

19:42.027 --> 19:44.261
But I think they're
just trying to protect me.

19:44.262 --> 19:45.729
(clears throat) In prep yesterday,

19:45.730 --> 19:48.532
I was still a little jetlagged,
but I'll be fine on the day.

19:48.533 --> 19:49.967
And just to be clear,

19:49.968 --> 19:52.303
- I am doing the show.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:52.304 --> 19:53.804
Wonderful.

19:53.805 --> 19:55.806
You have a second to talk

19:55.807 --> 19:56.974
about Ecuador with me?

19:56.975 --> 19:58.476
Sure. Um, Laura, will
you join us, please?

19:58.477 --> 20:00.778
JACKSON: <i>I also hear</i>

20:00.779 --> 20:02.913
we're handing over one of
the biggest oil fields

20:02.914 --> 20:05.216
in the hemisphere to the Chinese?

20:05.217 --> 20:08.152
Got a testy phone call
from Chip Harding, did we?

20:08.153 --> 20:10.154
(sighs) Is there any other kind?

20:10.155 --> 20:12.189
You know the president is committed

20:12.190 --> 20:13.824
to weaning us off Middle Eastern oil.

20:13.825 --> 20:16.494
He's also committed to
preserving the Amazon.

20:16.495 --> 20:19.196
Which is why we are
signatories to RACTO,

20:19.197 --> 20:20.498
or whatever the hell that is.

20:20.499 --> 20:21.599
Rainforests of the Americas

20:21.600 --> 20:23.067
Conservation Treaty Organization, sir.

20:23.068 --> 20:26.137
You're the fainter, aren't you?

20:26.138 --> 20:27.404
(groans): Mm.

20:27.405 --> 20:29.406
(laughs): I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:29.407 --> 20:32.810
It's just that nothing funny
ever happens in this town.

20:32.811 --> 20:34.678
Don't worry. You'll bounce back.

20:34.679 --> 20:37.181
Look, for a few billion dollars,

20:37.182 --> 20:38.883
we can save one of the most

20:38.884 --> 20:40.518
ecologically-important areas on Earth.

20:40.519 --> 20:41.652
If you've got

20:41.653 --> 20:43.821
a few billion dollars
lying around, go for it,

20:43.822 --> 20:45.189
because Congress won't.

20:45.190 --> 20:47.024
And at least Ashmont Petroleum

20:47.025 --> 20:49.226
would be bound by the treaty
to develop the oil field as...

20:49.227 --> 20:50.528
Come on.

20:50.529 --> 20:53.797
We're not seriously falling
back on the mighty RACTO?

20:53.798 --> 20:56.600
...as non-invasively as possible.
Isn't that correct?

20:56.601 --> 20:57.968
Theoretically, sir.

20:57.969 --> 20:59.770
Which is more than the Chinese can say.

20:59.771 --> 21:01.772
Look, I'm all for saving the planet,

21:01.773 --> 21:04.808
but the bottom line is, if
we can't get our company in,

21:04.809 --> 21:06.691
we should at least keep
the Chinese one out.

21:06.692 --> 21:08.245
These are independent countries, Russell.

21:08.246 --> 21:09.947
I don't have a lot of cards to play.

21:09.948 --> 21:11.748
So find more cards.

21:12.383 --> 21:14.218
Thank you, Laura.

21:14.219 --> 21:16.220
Yes, ma'am.

21:16.221 --> 21:18.589
And technically, sir,

21:18.590 --> 21:21.224
I vomited... a little.

21:23.827 --> 21:25.663
Good to know.

21:25.664 --> 21:26.964
(sighs)

21:26.965 --> 21:29.867
Look, Bess, this coup business

21:29.868 --> 21:32.369
is the worst body blow to the
presidency since Watergate.

21:32.370 --> 21:33.671
The public needs to know

21:33.672 --> 21:35.606
their government hasn't slid off a cliff,

21:35.607 --> 21:38.809
which means you need to
go on <i>Face the Nation.</i>

21:38.810 --> 21:41.278
So...

21:41.279 --> 21:43.881
you up for the damn show or not?

21:43.882 --> 21:47.316
Absolutely.

21:54.358 --> 21:56.660
Do you have any ideas
about what I might do,

21:56.661 --> 21:58.329
or are the taxpayers just shelling out

21:58.330 --> 21:59.930
for another one of
Gordon's expensive walks?

21:59.931 --> 22:01.398
(chuckles): Look, saving a little piece

22:01.399 --> 22:03.801
of the Amazon probably won't
matter in the end anyway.

22:03.802 --> 22:06.637
Best to win Dalton some
goodwill with Chip Harding.

22:06.638 --> 22:08.939
How? By getting Justice off his back

22:08.940 --> 22:11.108
so he can go back to Ecuador and...

22:11.109 --> 22:13.010
bribe his way into winning the bid?

22:13.011 --> 22:16.880
Yes. But just in case I'm ever deposed, no.

22:16.881 --> 22:18.782
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

22:18.783 --> 22:21.452
Besides, you literally just
called him a pompous tool.

22:21.453 --> 22:24.255
He really is. Even other
pompous tool CEOs hate him.

22:24.256 --> 22:25.556
Like my friend, Owen Walton.

22:25.557 --> 22:26.724
Pompous tools run the world.

22:26.725 --> 22:28.626
You might as well get
on their good side.

22:28.627 --> 22:31.362
And hope that the tiny sliver
of the Amazon that's left

22:31.363 --> 22:33.364
is protected by RACTO?

22:33.365 --> 22:36.200
The "T," by the way,
stands for "toothless".

22:36.201 --> 22:37.668
There you go.

22:37.669 --> 22:40.871
How can the Chinese purport
to be a responsible actor

22:40.872 --> 22:44.041
in the Amazon when they're not
even a party to the treaty

22:44.042 --> 22:45.509
charged with its protection?

22:45.510 --> 22:47.211
I was being you there.

22:47.212 --> 22:50.881
So tie up China by officially
protesting their non-membership?

22:50.882 --> 22:53.917
RACTO may be toothless,
but Ecuador is a signatory.

22:53.918 --> 22:57.087
China would be forced to respond.

22:57.088 --> 22:59.523
Whew. Talk about poking the bear.

22:59.524 --> 23:02.126
Look, the White House wants to
keep them out of our backyard.

23:02.127 --> 23:04.595
It would take China at least
a year to unstick themselves

23:04.596 --> 23:05.929
from all the red tape.
During which time...

23:05.930 --> 23:08.032
The Selva isn't developed.
And Ashmont Petroleum

23:08.033 --> 23:10.134
gets its ducks in a row
and wins the contract.

23:10.135 --> 23:13.037
So both the Earth and America win.

23:13.038 --> 23:15.404
Until America actually wins.

23:19.610 --> 23:21.812
MAN (in distance): Be advised,
we're losing the fight,

23:21.813 --> 23:24.081
but not by much. Don't
underestimate these terrorists.

23:24.082 --> 23:26.517
(faint gunfire, explosions)

23:26.518 --> 23:28.985
I can't find a break!
I don't have a shot!

23:31.789 --> 23:32.923
It's late.

23:32.924 --> 23:36.060
I didn't even hear you come in.

23:36.061 --> 23:38.996
Just winding down.

23:38.997 --> 23:40.798
By playing a video game you've never

23:40.799 --> 23:43.534
shown any interest in
at 3:30 in the morning?

23:43.535 --> 23:45.769
Yup.

23:45.770 --> 23:48.272
Okay, babe, your Titan is ready.

23:48.273 --> 23:51.041
See? Here, press this
button, get your Titan.

23:51.042 --> 23:54.878
You play this game way
more than you cop to.

23:54.879 --> 23:57.247
(chuckles) Possibly true.

23:57.248 --> 23:59.249
WOMAN: Transferring control to pilot.

23:59.250 --> 24:02.718
Sorry I was such a bitch before.

24:03.587 --> 24:05.988
It's okay.

24:07.524 --> 24:09.560
How was Jason's first day?

24:09.561 --> 24:13.130
It was fine. Everything's fine.

24:13.131 --> 24:15.531
No, it isn't.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.288
- Minister Chen is waiting for you.
- (sighs)

24:25.289 --> 24:28.326
Took a detour from his White House visit

24:28.327 --> 24:30.429
to let us know how pissed he is

24:30.430 --> 24:32.998
about our little Ecuador maneuver?

24:32.999 --> 24:34.166
I'm guessing.

24:34.167 --> 24:35.834
Well, that would be safe guess.

24:35.835 --> 24:38.270
Ma'am, pardon me, but...

24:38.271 --> 24:40.439
you look a little tired.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.374
(laughs) Thanks, Nadine.

24:42.375 --> 24:45.177
No, really. Are you sleeping all right?

24:45.178 --> 24:47.446
- Like a baby.
- DAISY: Oh, congratulations again, Jay.

24:47.447 --> 24:49.948
She's gorgeous. Here's the secretary.

24:49.949 --> 24:52.684
- Abby had the baby. A little girl.
- Oh, oh.

24:52.685 --> 24:54.453
My gosh.

24:54.454 --> 24:56.288
Well, hey, sweetheart.

24:56.289 --> 24:57.823
Hey, boss.

24:57.824 --> 25:00.325
Not you.

25:00.326 --> 25:01.793
What's her name?

25:01.794 --> 25:03.328
Wait for it.

25:03.329 --> 25:06.698
Chloe Elizabeth Whitman.

25:06.699 --> 25:08.533
- What a suck-up!
- Aw.

25:08.534 --> 25:10.602
It's her grandmother's name, jerk.

25:10.603 --> 25:13.071
Hey, come on, honey.

25:13.072 --> 25:15.474
Say hi to the secretary, sweetheart.

25:15.475 --> 25:17.242
Oh, she's...

25:17.243 --> 25:18.543
she's beautiful, Jay.

25:18.544 --> 25:21.646
She's just...

25:21.647 --> 25:23.415
BLAKE: Ma'am.

25:23.416 --> 25:24.449
Minister Chen.

25:24.450 --> 25:26.084
NADINE: Ma'am.

25:26.085 --> 25:27.319
Listen,

25:27.320 --> 25:28.820
you bring her in really soon, okay?

25:28.821 --> 25:30.889
I want to meet her in person.

25:30.890 --> 25:33.058
CHEN: <i>Madam Secretary,</i>

25:33.059 --> 25:34.926
this protest you've lodged with RACTO

25:34.927 --> 25:36.828
is clearly a stalling tactic.

25:36.829 --> 25:38.196
You want to help

25:38.197 --> 25:40.198
Ashmont Petroleum win a
bid they couldn't win

25:40.199 --> 25:41.566
honestly or fairly.

25:41.567 --> 25:44.169
You really want to accuse
Ashmont Petroleum

25:44.170 --> 25:46.304
of being the only
unscrupulous actor here?

25:46.305 --> 25:48.540
I would suggest you tread
carefully, Madam Secretary.

25:48.541 --> 25:51.977
So you're saying that it is not common

25:51.978 --> 25:53.712
Chinese business practice

25:53.713 --> 25:56.448
to get at-at the resources

25:56.449 --> 25:58.416
of developing nations
by bribing their elites?

25:58.417 --> 26:02.087
The West did just that for
centuries, including to China.

26:02.088 --> 26:04.289
Just because it's your turn
now doesn't make it right.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.757
While fascinating,

26:05.758 --> 26:08.326
this philosophical discussion
is hardly germane.

26:08.327 --> 26:11.329
I strongly urge you to
retract your protest.

26:11.330 --> 26:12.764
But there are so many other

26:12.765 --> 26:15.500
fascinating subjects to discuss.

26:15.501 --> 26:18.737
Your currency devaluation,

26:18.738 --> 26:20.672
unfair export subsidies,

26:20.673 --> 26:22.313
intellectual property theft. I mean,

26:22.314 --> 26:23.775
- not to mention
- Madam Secretary...

26:23.776 --> 26:26.111
your labor and environmental...

26:26.112 --> 26:28.513
Can we even call them laws? (laughs)

26:28.514 --> 26:30.815
- More like suggestions.
- Madam Secretary,

26:30.816 --> 26:33.451
this inflammatory performance
will not help your cause

26:33.452 --> 26:35.554
in Ecuador or in any other area.

26:35.555 --> 26:37.956
Perhaps we should talk at a later time.

26:37.957 --> 26:39.925
My-my apologies. Let's...

26:39.926 --> 26:42.894
Let's talk about something
less inflammatory.

26:42.895 --> 26:45.830
How are your children?

26:45.831 --> 26:47.432
They're fine.

26:47.433 --> 26:49.434
Good, good.

26:49.435 --> 26:51.069
Kids are a blessing.

26:51.070 --> 26:53.438
Indeed.

26:53.439 --> 26:55.140
Course, when they look
back at the Amazon

26:55.141 --> 26:57.876
and what we did to it, they'll
think we must have hated them.

26:57.877 --> 26:59.678
Again, ma'am, these remarks...

26:59.679 --> 27:00.879
No, no, it's interesting,

27:00.880 --> 27:03.448
because, you see, if we chop it all down,

27:03.449 --> 27:06.952
we pretty much guarantee
that the planet overheats,

27:06.953 --> 27:10.288
and our kids will live in a
totally destabilized world.

27:10.289 --> 27:13.024
(scoffs) Well, then at least
they'll be able to go to war

27:13.025 --> 27:14.826
with each other over fresh water.

27:14.827 --> 27:16.962
- That'll be kicky.
- Madam Secretary, are you quite all right?

27:16.963 --> 27:19.030
Are you not hearing me?!

27:19.031 --> 27:21.166
Your children and mine will suffer

27:21.167 --> 27:22.934
because of choices we make today.

27:22.935 --> 27:24.502
They will suffer,

27:24.503 --> 27:27.005
and there will be nothing
that we can do to help them!

27:27.006 --> 27:30.141
Is that what you want?!
Is that... (pants)

27:30.142 --> 27:32.509
Will you excuse me for a minute?

27:35.247 --> 27:36.848
(door closes)

27:36.849 --> 27:38.416
(panting): Will you call 911?

27:38.417 --> 27:42.454
I think I'm having a heart attack.

27:42.455 --> 27:43.355
(siren wailing)

27:43.356 --> 27:44.723
46-year-old female presenting

27:44.724 --> 27:46.258
with chest pain, shortness of breath,

27:46.259 --> 27:47.626
sinus tach and hypertensive

27:47.627 --> 27:49.261
on two liters of O2, aspirin and EKG

27:49.262 --> 27:51.696
- on the bus.
- Get her a X-ray,

27:51.697 --> 27:53.031
blood draw and sublingual nitroglycerin,

27:53.032 --> 27:54.499
and take her up to Cardiac Care.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.534
- Elizabeth? Elizabeth, I'm here.
- We're going to take

27:56.535 --> 27:59.004
- good care of you, Madam Secretary.
- How is she?

27:59.005 --> 28:01.154
We're taking her upstairs
to run some tests now.

28:01.155 --> 28:01.840
It's okay,

28:01.841 --> 28:03.942
sweetheart, I'm here.
It's gonna be all right.

28:03.943 --> 28:07.779
Well, the good news is that you're fine.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.481
You didn't have a heart attack.

28:09.482 --> 28:10.982
HENRY: So what was it, then?

28:10.983 --> 28:13.818
Well, uh, most likely a panic attack.

28:13.819 --> 28:15.453
You have got the job for it.

28:15.454 --> 28:16.821
Oh, God.

28:16.822 --> 28:19.457
Is it bad that I wish that I'd
actually had a heart attack?

28:19.458 --> 28:20.792
Now, going forward, I'd recommend

28:20.793 --> 28:23.828
you go easy on the coffee,
take a few personal days.

28:23.829 --> 28:26.531
From what I see in the news,
you've been pretty busy.

28:26.532 --> 28:29.500
HENRY: Thank you, Doctor.

28:35.807 --> 28:37.876
Navy SEALs get this, you know.

28:37.877 --> 28:40.445
You tougher than a Navy SEAL?

28:40.446 --> 28:44.515
Maybe, like, a-a really runty one.

28:52.991 --> 28:55.960
I think maybe I got a
little bit more affected

28:55.961 --> 28:58.228
by Iran than I thought.

28:59.898 --> 29:01.166
But it was one incident,

29:01.167 --> 29:04.202
and it passed and I'm fine.

29:04.203 --> 29:05.870
Look, I know you think
you can tough this out,

29:05.871 --> 29:07.472
but guess what, you can't.

29:07.473 --> 29:10.342
You have got to get help now,
before this really takes hold

29:10.343 --> 29:12.777
- and gets worse.
- I can't just drop everything

29:12.778 --> 29:15.380
- and take a spa day because I'm sad.
- Stop. You don't have to

29:15.381 --> 29:18.248
drop everything; you just
need to talk to someone.

29:22.887 --> 29:27.057
I know. I'm all messed up.

29:28.493 --> 29:29.828
One minute I'm fine,

29:29.829 --> 29:32.697
and then the next I'm furious,

29:32.698 --> 29:35.100
then I'm numb.

29:35.101 --> 29:36.568
Well, considering what
you've been through,

29:36.569 --> 29:38.370
it's totally normal.

29:38.371 --> 29:39.871
(laughs) Really?

29:39.872 --> 29:42.040
Because it feels...

29:42.041 --> 29:44.441
totally crazy.

29:47.779 --> 29:50.515
(sniffles)

29:50.516 --> 29:53.284
The truth is,

29:53.285 --> 29:57.321
I'm just not ready to talk
about what happened yet.

29:58.890 --> 29:59.958
Okay.

29:59.959 --> 30:02.427
- But you heard the doctor, yeah?
- Yup.

30:02.428 --> 30:03.962
You need to take a few days off.

30:03.963 --> 30:06.064
I can't. It would be a whole thing.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.332
So what?

30:07.333 --> 30:09.534
This is your health we're talking about.

30:09.535 --> 30:11.936
I hear you. I do, I really do.

30:11.937 --> 30:13.571
(sniffles)

30:13.572 --> 30:15.839
But we're okay, right?

30:18.476 --> 30:20.712
Yeah.

30:20.713 --> 30:23.081
Sorry I've been screaming at you a lot.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.649
No, it's totally good. It's fun.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.684
(laughs)

30:26.685 --> 30:29.486
- I'm gonna go get Stevie.
- Okay.

30:37.295 --> 30:40.031
Hey.

30:40.032 --> 30:42.700
- Is she okay?
- She's fine. She's totally fine.

30:42.701 --> 30:43.668
Just go in and

30:43.669 --> 30:44.969
- talk to her.
- Okay.

30:44.970 --> 30:46.938
I'll be right there.

30:46.939 --> 30:49.574
Russell, are those for me?
You shouldn't have.

30:49.575 --> 30:51.476
- How is she?
- She's fine.

30:51.477 --> 30:53.278
Good. Then I'll just go in

30:53.279 --> 30:54.846
and convey the president's best wishes.

30:54.847 --> 30:56.947
I said she's fine, Russell.

30:58.082 --> 31:00.484
Tell that to the Chinese.

31:01.119 --> 31:02.387
Thank you for coming.

31:02.388 --> 31:05.323
Hope you're right, Henry. I really do.

31:05.324 --> 31:07.492
But if she's not fine,

31:07.493 --> 31:10.462
then you're not doing her
or your country any favors

31:10.463 --> 31:12.863
by keeping it from me.

31:19.637 --> 31:22.105
Give her these for me, will you?

31:33.059 --> 31:35.553
The doctors concluded the
secretary is in good health

31:35.554 --> 31:37.954
- and was simply exhausted.
- No, they didn't.

31:37.955 --> 31:39.856
Guys, she can't be exhausted.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.425
Ed Muskie was exhausted.

31:41.426 --> 31:44.528
"Exhausted" is Washington code
for complete mental freak-out,

31:44.529 --> 31:46.463
- you 12-year-olds.
- BLAKE: Please, say "exhausted" more.

31:46.464 --> 31:48.331
MATT: Hey, she flew to Iran,

31:48.332 --> 31:51.368
thwarted a coup, then flew home
and went right back to work.

31:51.369 --> 31:53.870
I think America would
understand if she's a little tired.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.839
Mike is, um...

31:55.840 --> 31:57.708
Right.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.142
Right.

31:59.143 --> 32:01.478
Listen, the story the
White House is peddling

32:01.479 --> 32:02.946
is "nothing to see here".

32:02.947 --> 32:05.282
Implying that the secretary

32:05.283 --> 32:07.584
had some sort of breakdown is definitely

32:07.585 --> 32:08.338
something to see.

32:08.339 --> 32:10.287
I'd bet my second house
that Russell Jackson

32:10.288 --> 32:12.556
is at the hospital right
now, trying to find out

32:12.557 --> 32:14.458
if our beloved Bess has
gone around the bend.

32:14.459 --> 32:16.693
He actually is at the
hospital right now.

32:16.694 --> 32:18.195
I just heard from her detail.

32:18.196 --> 32:19.763
MIKE: Look at that... I'm psychic.

32:19.764 --> 32:21.631
And if he decides she is,

32:21.632 --> 32:23.633
she'll be tossed overboard, but quick.

32:23.634 --> 32:25.035
DAISY: Fine, no exhaustion.

32:25.036 --> 32:26.737
We'll just stick to the facts:
she was feeling unwell,

32:26.738 --> 32:28.705
she went to the hospital,
doctors say she's fine.

32:28.706 --> 32:30.107
MATT: And answer any follow-ups with,

32:30.108 --> 32:32.042
"I don't speculate, I'm not a doctor."

32:32.043 --> 32:34.111
See? Now you actually sound like
you know what you're doing.

32:34.112 --> 32:35.445
Oh, drop dead, old man.

32:35.446 --> 32:37.047
DAISY: Okay, the real question is:

32:37.048 --> 32:38.682
do we really think she's actually okay?

32:38.683 --> 32:40.917
Oh, of course she is.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.236
MATT: Based on what, Blake?
The fact that

32:42.237 --> 32:43.653
she bawled out the foreign minister

32:43.654 --> 32:44.755
of our biggest creditor?

32:44.756 --> 32:47.090
NADINE: She's okay until she tells us

32:47.091 --> 32:48.125
she isn't.

32:48.126 --> 32:49.559
Got it?

32:49.560 --> 32:52.129
Obviously, we need to push back
<i>Face the Nation</i> for at least

32:52.130 --> 32:54.598
a couple of days. Meanwhile,

32:54.599 --> 32:57.367
I've got to try to put out
the fire with Minister Chen.

32:57.368 --> 33:00.570
- So let's get back to work.
- (ringtone playing)

33:00.571 --> 33:02.038
That's M. Sec now.

33:02.039 --> 33:03.173
I know what you're all thinking:

33:03.174 --> 33:05.742
"Why is she calling him and not me?"

33:05.743 --> 33:09.246
Well, shame on you, petty, petty people.

33:09.247 --> 33:10.714
Hello.

33:10.715 --> 33:14.084
I'm so relieved the secretary
is feeling more like herself.

33:14.085 --> 33:16.887
Please convey my warm regards.

33:16.888 --> 33:19.623
I certainly will, and thank you
again for your understanding

33:19.624 --> 33:20.991
and for stopping by.

33:20.992 --> 33:23.560
Think nothing of it.

33:23.561 --> 33:25.796
But if the secretary
continues to push forward

33:25.797 --> 33:27.130
with this attempt to stymie

33:27.131 --> 33:29.900
our rightful and lawful
investment in Ecuador...

33:29.901 --> 33:32.969
that, China might not
be so quick to forgive.

33:32.970 --> 33:35.772
Well, I would not presume
to speak for the secretary

33:35.773 --> 33:37.541
on such a serious issue,

33:37.542 --> 33:40.243
but I will certainly
convey your concern.

33:40.244 --> 33:41.411
See that you do.

33:41.412 --> 33:43.213
Because if the secretary's
words were not

33:43.214 --> 33:45.715
a moment of unreason
but rather indicative

33:45.716 --> 33:47.484
of an official attitude toward China...

33:47.485 --> 33:50.020
- I assure you they were not.
- ...then China, in turn,

33:50.021 --> 33:54.024
might begin to feel that
the United States' debt

33:54.025 --> 33:57.960
is a less than reliable
investment for our surplus.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.397
Yes, sir.

34:00.398 --> 34:01.865
Good day, Ms. Tolliver.

34:01.866 --> 34:03.633
Good day, sir.

34:03.634 --> 34:05.735
- Oy.
- Yeah.

34:05.736 --> 34:07.204
MIKE: Wait till you see how inspired

34:07.205 --> 34:08.905
the lowly grunts are by
their unsinkable leader.

34:08.906 --> 34:11.708
Bounces back from a heart
attack the same day.

34:11.708 --> 34:13.583
Imaginary heart attack.
Huzzah, huzzah.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.179
It's better than a real
one, believe you me.

34:15.179 --> 34:18.176
- So are you up for this meeting with Owen?
- Yes, absolutely.

34:18.177 --> 34:20.212
- Glad to have you back.
- Because even though he was in town,

34:20.213 --> 34:21.286
- it took a lot of wrangling
- Thanks, Erin.

34:21.288 --> 34:22.001
to get him into the room under

34:22.002 --> 34:23.620
- such short notice.
- I'm not going to embarrass you.

34:23.621 --> 34:25.420
- Don't worry about it.
- Good, because if it were up to me,

34:25.420 --> 34:27.751
the only person you'd be in a
room with is a psychiatrist.

34:27.752 --> 34:29.953
(laughs) Well, thanks for
the vote of confidence.

34:29.954 --> 34:32.456
I'm withholding that until we
see if your plan actually works.

34:32.456 --> 34:34.458
So, you set?

34:34.458 --> 34:36.125
(ears ringing)

34:39.563 --> 34:41.165
(gunfire)

34:41.166 --> 34:42.299
Abdol!

34:42.300 --> 34:43.367
(shouts)

34:43.368 --> 34:45.201
You good?

34:45.936 --> 34:47.603
- What?
- Are... Are you good to go?

34:47.605 --> 34:48.772
Yes.

34:48.773 --> 34:50.574
Yeah, absolutely. I just...

34:50.574 --> 34:53.043
I'm gonna... Um... One thing...

34:53.043 --> 34:56.712
No, no, I got it. I got it.
I'm... Right back.

35:02.453 --> 35:04.221
Henry?

35:04.222 --> 35:06.056
Yeah.

35:06.057 --> 35:07.957
So...

35:09.493 --> 35:11.995
...turns out, you were right.

35:11.996 --> 35:13.864
Maybe, um,

35:13.865 --> 35:17.667
coming back today wasn't
such a hot idea after all.

35:19.570 --> 35:23.006
Owen, it's been too long.
St. Moritz, right?

35:23.007 --> 35:25.242
- How the hell are you?
- Uh, well, a little confused.

35:25.243 --> 35:27.377
- I thought I was meeting the secretary.
- We were walking in the door,

35:27.378 --> 35:30.347
she got a call from the White
House. Big mess in Russia.

35:30.348 --> 35:32.082
Very big,

35:32.083 --> 35:34.318
very messy. But you
didn't hear it from us.

35:34.319 --> 35:35.986
Nadine Tolliver,

35:35.987 --> 35:37.421
Secretary McCord's chief of staff.

35:37.422 --> 35:39.490
Thank you so much for coming in.

35:39.491 --> 35:41.091
And this is Laura...
something something.

35:41.092 --> 35:43.160
Uh, Vargas. Pleased to meet you.

35:43.161 --> 35:45.262
Uh, look, I-I don't want
to be rude or whatever,

35:45.263 --> 35:46.730
but I've got a gala I'm supposed to

35:46.731 --> 35:49.066
- go to in a little while...
- Oh, Mr. Walton, please.

35:49.067 --> 35:52.703
The secretary had hoped to
discuss an opportunity with you.

35:52.704 --> 35:54.304
The chance for your charitable

35:54.305 --> 35:56.173
foundation to save

35:56.174 --> 35:59.977
over 4,000 square miles of pristine

35:59.978 --> 36:01.979
Amazonian rainforest.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.681
While th-that's an important
number unto itself,

36:04.682 --> 36:06.750
the positive impact on
the health of the planet

36:06.751 --> 36:09.253
would be exponentially larger.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.855
Uh, look, uh, that... This is super cool

36:11.856 --> 36:13.323
and I'm all about the environment.

36:13.324 --> 36:14.925
I mean, my foundation

36:14.926 --> 36:17.728
is already doing this
whole thing with reefs.

36:17.729 --> 36:20.464
Or maybe sharks. But
either way, it's amazing.

36:20.465 --> 36:21.899
You should set up a meeting with them.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.335
Let me put all this another way, Owen.

36:25.336 --> 36:28.071
How would you like to win a Nobel Prize

36:28.072 --> 36:31.207
for sticking it to Chip Harding?

36:32.543 --> 36:34.844
Chip wants to drill down there?

36:35.979 --> 36:37.513
I'm listening.

36:45.489 --> 36:48.192
- Russell.
- Evening, Henry.

36:48.193 --> 36:49.826
Look...

36:49.827 --> 36:52.194
I come in peace.

36:55.165 --> 36:57.601
Good fix you had on the Ecuador thing.

36:57.602 --> 36:59.670
Sounds like your team
handled it well, too.

36:59.671 --> 37:01.171
I shouldn't have doubted you.

37:01.172 --> 37:02.706
Thanks.

37:02.707 --> 37:04.007
I mean, China's not happy.

37:04.008 --> 37:06.877
Yeah, well, they lost.

37:06.878 --> 37:09.513
And because I screamed at Minister Chen.

37:09.514 --> 37:12.281
Nadine calmed him down.

37:13.050 --> 37:15.118
And the vice-president's taking him bowling

37:15.119 --> 37:17.453
or some damn thing.

37:21.992 --> 37:24.194
Summer after junior year of high school,

37:24.195 --> 37:26.263
my big brother Kenny took me fishing

37:26.264 --> 37:29.565
for getting straight A's.

37:30.701 --> 37:33.804
My dad took off when we were kids, so...

37:33.805 --> 37:36.006
Anyway, we were driving back,

37:36.007 --> 37:38.175
at night,

37:38.176 --> 37:40.344
and this drunk hunter

37:40.345 --> 37:43.347
T-boned us with his truck.

37:43.348 --> 37:46.183
I was a little banged up.

37:46.184 --> 37:48.984
But Kenny died at the scene.

37:52.889 --> 37:56.393
Makes it back from Vietnam in one piece,

37:56.394 --> 37:58.595
he dies right there on
the side of the highway

37:58.596 --> 38:00.797
with the paramedics working on him

38:00.798 --> 38:02.933
and the looky-loos slowing down

38:02.934 --> 38:05.334
and gawk.

38:09.006 --> 38:11.642
Anyway, I'm mostly good now.

38:11.643 --> 38:14.076
I won't bore you with my triggers.

38:15.946 --> 38:18.881
Suffice to say I haven't
been fishing in a while.

38:22.786 --> 38:26.655
Here's someone who can keep her mouth shut.

38:29.293 --> 38:31.694
Welcome to the club.

38:33.363 --> 38:36.300
Thanks, Russell.

38:36.301 --> 38:38.701
Take care of yourself, Bess.

38:53.050 --> 38:54.952
I wonder how she's doing.

38:54.953 --> 38:57.855
Well, her last text
said she was resting...

38:57.856 --> 38:59.390
- and bored.
- Oh.

38:59.391 --> 39:02.426
So, Laura, way to hit it out of
the park on your first at bat.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.595
- Welcome to the bigs.
- Yeah.

39:04.596 --> 39:05.863
Oh, uh, he's terrible at sports,

39:05.864 --> 39:07.364
- by the way.
- Don't do... Don't say...

39:07.365 --> 39:09.262
Most of my friends from
grad school are still writing

39:09.263 --> 39:10.363
their dissertations.

39:10.364 --> 39:12.732
- We actually did something today.
- To that rarest

39:12.733 --> 39:15.535
of Washington feats:
actually doing something.

39:15.536 --> 39:17.804
- Hear, hear.
- Yes. - <i>Salud.</i>

39:17.805 --> 39:19.639
I just hope

39:19.640 --> 39:22.976
the media noise about the
hospital visit will die down.

39:22.977 --> 39:24.544
Honestly, I don't think it will

39:24.545 --> 39:25.845
until she does <i>Face the Nation.</i>

39:25.846 --> 39:28.413
<i>If</i> she does <i>Face the Nation.</i>

39:29.249 --> 39:31.050
MAN (over TV): That's a double kill.

39:31.051 --> 39:33.452
(gunfire)

39:37.157 --> 39:39.624
Do you want to tell me about it?

39:43.997 --> 39:46.032
Fred Cole and the guys in my detail

39:46.033 --> 39:48.401
died because I went to Iran.

39:48.402 --> 39:51.571
They died saving me.

39:51.572 --> 39:54.307
They died saving their
country from a war.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.075
They died doing their duty.

39:56.076 --> 39:57.811
They died...

39:57.812 --> 40:00.380
- because of me.
- Babe,

40:00.381 --> 40:04.384
you did not force Fred Cole
to run toward the gunfire.

40:04.385 --> 40:06.019
That was his choice.

40:06.020 --> 40:08.186
And you know he would do it again.

40:09.823 --> 40:12.125
And then there's Abdol.

40:12.126 --> 40:14.527
Javani's son, right?

40:14.528 --> 40:16.928
What about him?

40:18.798 --> 40:21.166
He was there.

40:23.069 --> 40:26.606
He was there in the room, too.

40:26.607 --> 40:28.675
I didn't tell you...

40:28.676 --> 40:31.978
I didn't tell anyone...

40:31.979 --> 40:35.782
'cause I couldn't get to him.

40:35.783 --> 40:39.351
I wanted so badly to protect that boy.

40:40.553 --> 40:42.956
Or at least keep him
from seeing his father

40:42.957 --> 40:46.659
murdered in his own living room.

40:46.660 --> 40:49.027
But I couldn't.

40:52.031 --> 40:54.399
Fred was on top of me.

40:56.269 --> 41:00.172
And I couldn't... get to him.

41:03.042 --> 41:07.279
How in the world is that
boy supposed to go on?

41:11.684 --> 41:13.853
We do all these

41:13.854 --> 41:16.855
horrible things to each other.

41:18.791 --> 41:21.527
And there are always,

41:21.528 --> 41:24.663
always kids in the middle.

41:30.236 --> 41:32.639
Henry,

41:32.640 --> 41:36.508
what have I done to our sweet children?

42:04.404 --> 42:07.607
BOB SCHIEFFER: <i>Madam Secretary,
you made an unprecedented trip</i>

42:07.608 --> 42:09.075
<i>to Iran to save</i>

42:09.076 --> 42:11.577
the nuclear deal between the Iranians

42:11.578 --> 42:13.546
and the United States.

42:13.547 --> 42:14.614
Yes, I did.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.916
And while you were there, of course,

42:16.917 --> 42:21.688
a coup that was eventually,
uh, foiled, uh, began.

42:21.689 --> 42:23.189
You were in the room

42:23.190 --> 42:25.858
when the foreign minister
Javani was killed.

42:25.859 --> 42:27.026
That's right.

42:27.027 --> 42:30.797
Who else was there,
and-and what happened?

42:30.798 --> 42:34.734
We were at Minister Javani's
house when it happened.

42:34.735 --> 42:37.303
Several members of my security detail

42:37.304 --> 42:40.006
were wounded or killed.

42:40.007 --> 42:42.675
Their courage was awe-inspiring,

42:42.676 --> 42:46.612
and I deeply mourn their loss,
as does the entire country.

42:46.613 --> 42:50.717
Minister Javani's son
witnessed his father's death.

42:50.718 --> 42:53.753
As a mother, I would have given anything

42:53.754 --> 42:56.756
to protect that child.

42:56.757 --> 42:58.191
Which is why

42:58.192 --> 43:00.393
I am determined as ever to see through

43:00.394 --> 43:03.229
the nuclear agreement that
his father gave his life for.

43:03.230 --> 43:06.332
<i>Because I think that's our greatest</i>

43:06.333 --> 43:08.568
<i>responsibility in this life:</i>

43:08.569 --> 43:10.536
<i>to leave a safer</i>

43:10.537 --> 43:13.740
<i>and more peaceful world for our children.</i>

43:13.741 --> 43:15.775
SCHIEFFER: <i>Madam Secretary, thank you.</i>

43:15.776 --> 43:18.243
ELIZABETH: <i>Thank you, Bob.</i>
