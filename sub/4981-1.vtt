My name's Lidia Simmons,
and I'm 12 years old.

03:13.393 --> 03:16.066

I can't really tell you much
about me nor my life

my brother Stu.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.407
All spring
Stu had been kind of quiet.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.542
Perhaps it was because
a couple months earlier

03:29.542 --> 03:33.353
our father had gone out
looking for work
and never returned.

Dad went away.

he'd come back from Vietnam,
things hadn't been just right.

Mom held two jobs
just to make ends meet,

03:44.124 --> 03:48.629

and the sweet smell of summer,

our father had come home.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.937
Looks more lonely
than anybody I ever seen.

Mom says that
war destroyed our lives.

It's how come
he couldn't find work.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.012
It's why he's been gone
all this time.

04:39.579 --> 04:43.183

the damn war,
we'd still have that house.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.084
The house had termites.

ever seemed to say "hello."

42:39.924 --> 42:41.725
"You can buy me."

42:41.725 --> 42:43.894
Did she say
where to get the money?

42:43.894 --> 42:46.197
No. She did not
mention that.

in the master suite.

I climbed up a tree,
snuck a peek.

her very own vanity.

a French potty in here.

you know something
about a mining job.

give my position
to someone else.

46:00.991 --> 46:03.394

a card tonight, right?

46:03.394 --> 46:04.461
That's right.

The problem is,
it's gonna cost 50 smackers.

get that?

46:11.101 --> 46:13.171

If I get the card,

46:16.573 --> 46:20.310

ride to work with me,
pay me $1 every day.

right here!

that is, Stephen?

I got five and some change
if you need it.

Not here, not now.

46:36.994 --> 46:39.630

17 plus this,
what Moe had, that's 18.

46:43.233 --> 46:46.170
I have 800 Coke bottles
you can have.

46:46.170 --> 46:50.407
That should give you
about $35, $40 at least.

46:50.407 --> 46:52.576
Mama, I thought
you was saving that money
for a...

46:52.576 --> 46:56.524

That is exactly right.
That is what this is.

before that place closes.

Sure!

47:18.669 --> 47:21.972

to save that.

blow it on a job

have a seat up here?

heard you whispering.

that you had to
interrupt me again.

and take us off the welfare.

01:24:11.313 --> 01:24:13.748
MARSH: Great!
That makes for a perfect day.

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.951
CHET: What the hell
they doing here?

01:24:15.951 --> 01:24:18.086
Hey, did you guys
tell them about this place?

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:20.188
Of course not!
MARSH: No way, man!

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:22.691
I gots to go home.

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:25.171
My mom gots to do my hair.
See you, Lid.

01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:29.998
Stu?

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.033
What?

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.902
I was gonna tell you.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:37.178
Tell me what?
What'd you do, Lidia?

01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:42.210
I mentioned to
the little kid Lipnicki Billy
that we was building a fort.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.812
He ain't even allowed
off his property.

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.113
How could
you be talking to him?

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:46.523
What?

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.652
All the junk
come from the Lipnickis' yard.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:52.187
Oh, no!

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:55.757
No!
MARSH: Oh, man,
I warned you, Stu!

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:58.727
A walking, talking
broadcast station,
that's what she is!

01:24:58.727 --> 01:25:00.672
Oh, man, I fold.

01:25:03.732 --> 01:25:06.234
They're halfway
across the lot.
What are we doing?

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:08.303
Stall them a minute.
I gotta think.

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:10.282
ARLISS: Simmons!

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:15.443
Simmons, you better
get your butt down here!

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:18.947
EBB:
Stu, it's kind of important
you come out here now!

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:22.017
I admit it.
I shouldn't have been there.

01:25:22.017 --> 01:25:23.952
Yeah.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:26.321
So I screwed up.
Yeah.

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:29.691
All right,
let's not make a big thing
out of this.

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:30.892
So, now what?

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:34.062
I don't know.
I'm not going out there
to fight them.

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:35.130
CHET: Oh, Stu!

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:37.565
You're not thinking
of handing it all back?

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:41.603
This is our house!
Maybe the only one
we're ever gonna have.

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:43.304
Don't you think
we ought to fight for it?

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:46.241
Don't you recall a damn thing
Daddy's taught us?

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:50.348
He finds out we been fighting,
he's gonna be
real disappointed.

01:25:50.779 --> 01:25:54.182
Well, maybe
this ain't the time.

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:57.720
But haven't you considered
that maybe
he's never gonna find out?

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:01.990
He's lying in that hospital,
on machines
that're breathing for him.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.459
Don't you say
one more word!

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:06.928
You just better not talk
like that no more!

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:09.764
He's gonna be fine!
He's always fine!

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:10.932
Okay, Stu, I'm sorry.

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:13.334
Name one time
he didn't turn out fine.

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.536
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:16.604
I... I didn't
mean that, really.

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:19.207
We'll figure another way,
that's all. No fighting.

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.575
(SPIRIT IN THE SKY PLAYING)

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:22.277
MARSH: Oh, Stu!

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:25.747
I think you ought to
join us out here
on the patio right quick!

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:29.024
Stu! Oh, Stu!

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:32.620
ARLISS: Come here, twerps!
Ow! Let go my ear!

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.396
CHET: Ow!
Shut your face, freckles!

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:43.031
Stuart Simmons,
meet Arliss Lipnicki again.

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:46.134
Billy there says
you all been
mooching of'n our property.

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:50.082
This is our stuff.
Your daddy took it
from our old house.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.576
Seen bird houses
built better than this.

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:58.580
Probably fall to pieces
in the first good wind.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.348
Bitching lock.
Where'd you get it?

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.050
It's my dad's.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.962
Come from the war.
Come on, give it back.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:11.659
Ah, goody gumdrops.
I think I'll just take it home
and play with it.

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:13.900
Now, come on. Give it back.

01:27:17.499 --> 01:27:20.001
That there's our stove,
tell you that right now.

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:22.737
Them boards and rusty nails
is our'n, too.

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.506
Well, if it's just them
few things,

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:26.508
we'll dismantle them
and give them back.

01:27:26.508 --> 01:27:27.775
Stu?

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:31.017
Trespasser wants to
give us back
our ruined boards

01:27:31.146 --> 01:27:34.249
with 10 million scratches
and dog piss stains.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.850
Afraid I'm gonna
have to lay claim
to this here

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:36.951
piece of crap fort.

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:39.354
Hell, you don't
need to claim it.

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.356
You guys can come
visit any time.

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:42.657
Yeah!

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.898
ARLISS: Shut up, Billy,
you little dip.

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:48.897
Hey, cool fort!

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:52.267
God, what the hell
did they do to your head?

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.804
Same thing
I'm gonna do to you!

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:57.338
You got five seconds
to tell me
an idea I like better

01:27:57.338 --> 01:27:59.340
than seizing this place
for our own.

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:03.754
Four, three, two.
We'll dare you for it.

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:07.248
Cool, Arliss! A dare!

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:08.816
What kind of dare?

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.118
Any kind you say.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.787
But if we win,
we keep the fort.

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.189
If you lose?

01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:16.293
It's yours. Lock and key.

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:21.502
It's fine by us.
See you at the quarry.

01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:36.644
BILLY: If we win,
do we get to own the fort
and say who's in it?

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:38.780
That's what we get to do.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.950
If I got the key,
I'd have it be everyone's

01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:46.888
and we'd have a big party
with Ring Dings,
Little Debbies,

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:49.123
Rocket Pops
and Yoo-hoos and...

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:51.459
Shut up, Billy,
you little broken record!

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:54.729
Thank you, now I'm starving.
And I mean starving.

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:56.674
God!

01:29:30.231 --> 01:29:32.301
I'm scared.

01:29:32.967 --> 01:29:34.810
Hold on, asshole!

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:39.513
I am holding on!

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:10.911
ARLISS: Water's calm now,
but she gets real ugly
when she empties.

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:18.585
Oh, man.

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:30.296
You sure
you swum down there?

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:32.994
You ain't psyching me out,
are you?

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:34.939
I told you I did.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.267
(RUMBLING)

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.260
Man!

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:06.928
What are them noises?

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.566
It's draining, I guess.

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:11.772
It'll stop sooner or later.

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:16.739
Stu, let's nix on this.
We can find another lot.

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.083
Look, it's real simple.

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:32.387
You and Leo's gonna
swim to the other side
and tag it.

01:31:32.387 --> 01:31:34.889
First one
back to the ladder
claims all.

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:37.926
Either side yellow-bellies,
it's a forfeit.

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:41.966
Y'all got that?

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:49.204
Oh, my God! What is that?

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.044
There ain't no way
across here.

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:58.352
Well, we'll find out,
won't we?

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.152
What's going on?

01:32:04.152 --> 01:32:06.020
You never been down here,
have you?

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.989
You swimming across here
is a bunch of dick.

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.390
It ain't as bad as it looks.

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:11.225
Simmons ain't afraid
to swim it.

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:13.027
That moron's crazier
than you.

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:14.796
You swim it!

01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:16.570
Fine! I will!

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:31.913
Willard, go down there.
I ain't going down there.

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:34.916
Don't you knuckle on me.
You want them
to think we's chicken?

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:38.186
They can think
whatever they like,
I ain't going down there.

01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:41.963
Ebb?
Why? You chicken, big fellow?

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.936
Ula?
No way!

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:54.039
EBB: Hey, where'd Leo go?

01:32:57.405 --> 01:33:00.908
You ready?
On your marks, get set...

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.411
Hold on. Look here.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.947
I'm gonna give you
one last chance to back out.

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:08.649
Give me the word,
and we'll think up
a different deal.

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:09.817
For your sake.

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.227
You forfeit?

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:15.289
Lidia, count us down.
On your marks.

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:17.358
You know there ain't no way.

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:19.838
Get set. Go.
You psycho?

01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:26.240
LIDIA: Stu! Stu, come on!
You're gonna make it, Stu!

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:31.340
You're halfway there!
Stu, come on!

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:36.077
Don't get in the middle!
Stay out of the middle!

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:38.420
Come on, Stu, swim!

01:33:44.252 --> 01:33:47.995
Stu! Come on, please, Stu!

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:52.461
Stu, come on,
you can make it, Stu!

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.061
(Gasping)

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.938
Swim!

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:05.650
Swim, Stu!
Come on, swim!

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:08.918
Come on, Stu!

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.584
(GASPING)
You can make it, Stu!

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:16.228
Come on, Stu! Stu!

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:22.429
Stu! Stu, come on!

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:27.235
Come on, Stu!
You can make it. Come on!

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:31.132
(GASPING)

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:33.768
I can't believe
that lunatic made it across!

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:36.203
I taught him
how to swim like that.

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:37.704
(STU COUGHING)

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:40.174
Boy, I psyched you out.

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:43.849
You thought
we was really gonna swim it.
What a cretin.

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:46.847
Hey! The fort's ours!

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:50.658
Have it. We never wanted
your cruddy old fort
in the first place.

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:56.732
I told you I'd get you
through this mess.

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.900
(LAUGHING)

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:08.178
STU: Hey, the lock.

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:13.183
Go get it yourself,
why don't you.
I dare you.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:34.665
Come on, Stu, forget the key.
We got the fort.

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.936
STU: Come on, Billy.
She's right.

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:45.006
Let's get out of here
before somebody gets hurt.

01:35:45.006 --> 01:35:50.111
LIDIA: So we deposited Billy
on firm ground
and went to visit Dad again.

01:35:50.111 --> 01:35:53.956
Stu thought he looked better.
Elvadine said
a prayer for him.

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:00.631
LOIS: I'm here, honey.

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.964
Do you even know who I am?

Lois.

01:36:17.672 --> 01:36:18.673
(CRYING)

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.587
That's me.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.422
That's me.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.988
(SCREEN DOOR SQUEAKS)

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.797
LIDIA: Hey, Mom!

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:46.806
Stuart!

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:50.879
Lidia. Y'all are to
come in here now.

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:57.587
Something wrong? Ma?

01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:01.849
Your daddy just died.

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.821
No.

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:09.460
No.
It wasn't painful.

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:14.938
His heart
just quit pumping.

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:20.267
He's gonna be okay.
He cannot die.
He's on machines.

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:21.602
Son, they took him off.

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:24.338
Well, tell them
to put him back on!

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:29.253
Honey, he's gone.

Come on, breathe! Breathe!

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:32.739
Don't quit now, Billy!
Will somebody please help me?

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:33.907
LIDIA: I will.

01:53:33.907 --> 01:53:35.108
You know
what you're doing?

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:36.917
LIDIA: I sure hope so.

01:53:37.877 --> 01:53:41.256
Wake up now, Billy.
Nobody's gonna be mad at you.

01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:49.089
You did the best you could.
Come on,
you're a real-life hero.

01:53:49.089 --> 01:53:50.431
(GRUNTING)

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:53.532

He woke up.

01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:23.389
You know, I saw an angel.
A real one.

01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:26.503
He was holding onto my hand.

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:30.864
And I was gonna
live in his kingdom.

01:54:30.864 --> 01:54:35.335
He said I must come back
and take care of my daddy.

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.613
And he looked like you,
but only bigger.

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:03.539
Come on, Billy.
Let's go home.

01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:07.339
(METAL CLANKING)

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:30.131
These were Dad's.

01:55:41.935 --> 01:55:44.608
What are you thinking?

01:55:45.705 --> 01:55:49.778
If Dad's watching,
he can go now.

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.190
(SNIFFLING)

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.788
He is watching.

(CRYING)

01:56:21.107 --> 01:56:22.575
LIDIA: From that day on,

01:56:22.575 --> 01:56:26.045
the Lipnickis
didn't hang around
the quarry no more.

01:56:26.045 --> 01:56:30.891
We didn't see much of them,
except for Billy,
who kind of adopted us all.

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:37.590
The guys and us
started to rebuild the fort,
but after a few days,

01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:40.570
we all got
kind of disinterested,
and give up.

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:43.796
Now Stu and his friends
mainly hang out
at the theater

01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:46.970
so as to
try and pick up babes.

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.009

01:56:50.937 --> 01:56:51.938
Someday

01:56:52.071 --> 01:56:55.484
We'll be together

01:56:55.608 --> 01:56:57.018
Say it, say it, say it

01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:02.715
LIDIA: Mama said
Daddy was at peace finally,

01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:05.285
that he wasn't suffering
no more.

01:57:05.285 --> 01:57:08.960
Then a few weeks later,
a visitor came to see us.

01:57:14.661 --> 01:57:16.140
(BABY CRYING)

Can I help you?
MAN: Oh.

01:57:20.934 --> 01:57:21.935
(CHUCKLING)

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:26.205
Well, good afternoon, ma'am.
My name is John Ray Wilkens.

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:28.007
I'm with
the Clairville Auction House.

01:57:28.007 --> 01:57:29.175
Yes.

01:57:29.175 --> 01:57:32.245
Well, about six weeks ago,
your husband put down a bid

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:34.714
on one of our
bank-owned properties.

01:57:34.714 --> 01:57:38.518
We tried to call y'all,
but I guess
the phone's been down.

01:57:38.518 --> 01:57:39.919
Things been
a little tight.

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:41.688
Yeah, well, anyway,

01:57:41.688 --> 01:57:46.102
your husband
put a down-payment bid
of $432.

01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:52.975
Well, thanks
for returning the check.
We could sure use the money.

01:57:53.733 --> 01:57:57.146
No, ma'am,
I'm not returning the check.

01:57:58.037 --> 01:58:00.707
You see, the bank took on
too many of these
failed mortgages,

01:58:00.707 --> 01:58:03.076
and if they don't
start getting rid of some
of these properties,

01:58:03.076 --> 01:58:04.911
they're gonna be
bankrupt themselves.

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:08.119
So, the bank accepted
your husband's offer,

01:58:08.915 --> 01:58:11.622
being that it was
the only one they got.

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:18.060
Are you telling me
Stephen bought us a house?

01:58:18.191 --> 01:58:19.328
Yes, ma'am.

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:40.619
Lipstick and rouge, Ma.

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:42.248
(SIGHS)

01:58:44.751 --> 01:58:46.730
Don't I know!

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:50.156
LIDIA: So, I guess
these memoirs
are about us

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:52.158
getting a home
of our own,

01:58:52.492 --> 01:58:56.529
but they're also
about learning
what's worth fighting for.

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:58.531
LIDIA: My daddy once said
of fighting,

01:58:58.531 --> 01:59:00.908
"We are meant
for better things,
you and I."

01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:04.170
And these days
whenever I'm ready
to belt someone

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:05.905
who's got my dander up,

01:59:05.905 --> 01:59:08.851
I hear him
whisper those words
in my ear.

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:15.848
My mama says
that people's lives
are like tapestries.

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:17.817
The color and the beauty
of the designs

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:20.486
depend all
on the people you know,

01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:23.262
the things you've learned.

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:31.131
What I learned this summer

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:36.269
is that no matter
how much people think
they understand war,

01:59:36.269 --> 01:59:38.840
war will never
understand people.

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:45.384
It's like a big machine
that don't nobody
really know how to work.

01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:48.981
Once it gets out of hand,

01:59:49.515 --> 01:59:50.950
winds up
wrecking all the things

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:53.327
you thought
you was fighting for,

01:59:53.986 --> 01:59:57.934
and a whole bunch
of other good things
you sort of forgot you had.

02:00:04.564 --> 02:00:08.136
I learned this summer
that my brother was right.

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:22.956
My daddy's the wisest man
I've ever known.

02:00:24.484 --> 02:00:27.386
And that no matter
what anybody tells you,

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:30.662
with God's help,
human beings can do anything.

02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:35.067
God! Look at it!

02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:38.403
Come on.

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:40.399

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:13.076

the good things to come

the world as one

02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:31.551
And I believe it could be
