WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:08.774
(sirens approaching)

00:08.776 --> 00:11.677
MAN (distant, muffled):
Right here. Right here.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.278
Lay down! Lay down!

00:13.280 --> 00:16.348
(indistinct shouting,
clamoring)

00:16.350 --> 00:19.551
(siren wails distantly)

00:28.229 --> 00:31.130
MAN:
You lie just like
everybody else!

00:31.132 --> 00:33.565
A gun never solved anything.
Believe me.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.034
Spike, he's escalating.
Where are you?

00:35.036 --> 00:36.502
SPIKE (whispering):
15 seconds away.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.403
That's not good enough!

00:37.405 --> 00:39.138
Just put the gun down.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.706
Bravo Team, are you set?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.508
I'll let you know
when we're there.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.309
You get over next to him
and put your hands up.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.211
Now. I need you now.
I need you now.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.246
It's over. It's over.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.614
No.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.482
Your time is up.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.422
Good luck with
your lawyer today.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.756
Thanks.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.397
(children shouting,
playing in distance)

01:05.399 --> 01:08.267
(bell tolling)

01:31.559 --> 01:35.260
(whistling)

01:36.430 --> 01:40.399
PARKER:
Hey, just one hole.
How many shots?

01:40.401 --> 01:41.400
(laughs quietly)

01:41.402 --> 01:43.102
Twenty.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.104
That's nice.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.338
That's why you're still
my number one.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.507
That's why I'm
always number one.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.411
Ed, we're being sued.
Wrongful death.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.351
First York Plaza.

02:01.856 --> 02:05.491
(man growling, yelling)

02:05.493 --> 02:06.475
What do you got?

02:06.476 --> 02:07.458
JULES (over radio):
Male youth.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.394
Breached the perimeter.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.395
(over radio):
Ed! The boy!

02:10.397 --> 02:12.564
(gunshot blasts)

02:17.505 --> 02:19.571
Wrongful death.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.409
We're being sued
or I'm being sued?

02:24.411 --> 02:28.914
Technically? You.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.785
So your file
has finally arrived.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.287
This is it?

02:35.289 --> 02:36.488
That's it.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.490
Prosecution's case against you.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.592
Okay, okay.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.563
All right!

02:44.565 --> 02:45.864
But Michael,
before you get too excited,

02:45.866 --> 02:47.566
I gotta tell you,
I've been through it all.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.502
I'm afraid you're
going to be disappointed.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.471
There's nothing in there
that you don't already know.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.239
There's nothing here about
my so-called confession?

02:54.241 --> 02:56.508
Just what the informant
said on the stand.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.877
There's nothing about how the
prosecution tracked him down

02:58.879 --> 03:01.180
how they got him to talk,
no paper trail.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.347
But how can that be?

03:02.349 --> 03:03.849
Where is it?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.100
I mean, isn't the prosecution

03:05.101 --> 03:06.350
supposed to render
all the evidence?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.320
No, I know.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.288
I've talked at length
with Cheznik's office.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.525
They even admitted that papers
may have been lost or misfiled.

03:17.198 --> 03:21.800
Those pages... they prove my
innocence; that I was framed.

03:21.802 --> 03:26.972
How can we... how can we
appeal without all the files?

03:28.976 --> 03:31.310
We're still appealing, right?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.479
We can still make a case.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.548
I'm sorry.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.486
The force is behind you
a hundred percent.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.688
I'm behind you, Ed.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.691
Frank McAndrews is gonna
talk you through it.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.327
You brought my lawyer back.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.962
They want you down at the
courthouse this morning.

03:49.964 --> 03:50.963
Deposition.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.531
I'm on shift.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.600
Ed, we need to be seen
taking this seriously.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.368
We stall,
they go to the press,

03:56.370 --> 03:58.537
this thing gets legs.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.705
Just hold your nose and
go down to the courthouse.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.974
They don't have a case.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.443
Are you kidding me?

04:04.445 --> 04:07.646
A guy walks into a building,
shoots a woman dead,

04:07.648 --> 04:10.616
holds another woman hostage,
turns his gun on you--

04:10.618 --> 04:13.986
I do what I'm hired and
trained to do-- come on!

04:13.988 --> 04:16.421
I know, that's the truth of what
happened-- nobody doubts that.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.789
Somebody does!

04:17.791 --> 04:19.958
Somebody does--
that's-- you know?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.527
Yeah, the guy's son.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.564
Everybody grieves in their own
way, right? You know that.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.366
They look for someone to blame.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.336
Well, look no further.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.673
But you promised me;
you said you'd represent me.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.541
We're understaffed,
under-funded.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.443
I got more cases
than I can handle,

04:38.445 --> 04:40.178
with files that<i> are</i> complete.

04:40.179 --> 04:41.912
People that are still
in jail, Michael.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.382
I'm sorry.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.516
Sorry?

04:44.518 --> 04:46.551
You're sorr...

04:46.553 --> 04:49.855
I spent 11 years in there,
wondering what happened.

04:49.857 --> 04:53.525
How somebody could get
on the stand and say

04:53.527 --> 04:55.394
that I said things that
I didn't even know.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.628
Ian, man,
if we don't appeal, I...

04:56.630 --> 04:57.629
Michael...

04:57.631 --> 04:59.431
Come on.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.034
You're young, you're 26,
you got early parole.

05:02.036 --> 05:04.469
You got your whole life,
you're free.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.737
No, I'm not free, Ian!

05:05.739 --> 05:08.307
Okay? As long as they
think I killed Katie--

05:08.309 --> 05:11.743
her family, my family,
everyone I ever met,

05:11.745 --> 05:14.613
everyone I ever knew--
I'll never be free.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.384
I can't help you.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.555
So who's gonna
be there?

05:23.557 --> 05:26.625
Uh... that lawyer,
her tape recorder, a bailiff.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.560
I hear there's gonna be
a couple of dancing girls.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.462
You know, we went through
this all before, you know?

05:30.464 --> 05:31.997
We went through it all
for the inquest, right?

05:31.999 --> 05:34.499
Stick to the facts, you got
nothing to worry about.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.570
What?

05:38.572 --> 05:39.604
Just... what?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.506
Ed, give me one hour.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.875
You tell the story,
and I work my magic,

05:43.877 --> 05:46.378
and then unfounded
lawsuit disappears,

05:46.380 --> 05:48.113
you're back in your
cape and tights.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.648
You're saving the world.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.450
You're still reading
comic books, huh?

05:51.452 --> 05:52.951
That's nice.
Let's do this.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.020
(keypad beeping)

05:59.493 --> 06:01.693
RECEPTIONIST:
Prosecutor's Office--
how may I direct your call?

06:01.695 --> 06:04.496
Hi, uh, my name is Stan Smith.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.398
I'm an associate
of Dan Cheznik's,

06:06.400 --> 06:07.599
from the Bar Association.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.835
I was hoping to make
an appointment with him.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.470
I lost his cell phone number.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.106
Mr. Cheznik isn't here;
he's in court all day.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.774
Can I get his secretary
to call you?

06:15.776 --> 06:16.908
No. Thank you.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.844
That won't be necessary.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.887
(bell tolls)

06:48.609 --> 06:51.943
(bell tolling continues)

07:05.159 --> 07:07.058
GUARD: Sir, just empty
your pockets, please?

07:09.129 --> 07:10.695
Thank you.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.665
(beeping)

07:13.667 --> 07:15.167
Step to the side, please.

07:15.169 --> 07:17.903
I just need to go in
for a minute...
Step to the side.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.938
Raise your arms.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.673
The prosecutor--
Arms up!

07:24.945 --> 07:26.478
He wanted to meet with me.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.480
Feet apart, please.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.081
Look, if you could
just have him paged...

07:30.083 --> 07:31.650
(wand buzzes)

07:31.652 --> 07:33.118
Raise your pant leg, sir.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.155
That's a parole device.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.590
Entering the courthouse
without an attorney

07:38.592 --> 07:40.592
is a direct violation
of parole...!

07:40.594 --> 07:42.561
GUARD:
Officer!
Back off!

07:42.563 --> 07:44.729
Put your hands up!
Don't move!

07:46.567 --> 07:47.566
(gunshot, people scream)

07:47.568 --> 07:49.801
I said don't move!

07:53.073 --> 07:55.173
Hostile! Main floor,
right corridor.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.142
Hostile! Main floor,
right corridor!

08:01.515 --> 08:05.484
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:37.584 --> 08:39.551
ED:
<i> I had the subject</i>
<i> in the crosshairs</i>

08:39.553 --> 08:41.753
when my sergeant
called Scorpio.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.288
I put my finger
on the trigger.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.223
So, from that point on,
it was your call

08:45.225 --> 08:46.858
whether to shoot or not,
is that correct?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.094
That's correct.
It was my call.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.229
(whispering):
We've got a man with a gun.
We're under lockdown.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.567
What's going on?

08:55.569 --> 08:56.034
I'm not finished.
Sir?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.202
Just a sec.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.970
ED:
What's going on?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.138
They're evacuating.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.240
BAILIFF:
I gotta ask you
to sit tight

09:02.242 --> 09:03.975
till all prisoners have been
returned to the holding cells

09:03.977 --> 09:05.143
and we can safely
clear the building.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.044
He hasn't finished.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.045
Yeah, uh, maybe we should

09:07.047 --> 09:08.246
just finish this up, Ed.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.614
I'm sure it's nothing.
Is this nothing?

09:09.616 --> 09:11.149
He would tell us
if it was something.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.084
Yeah? Ed?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.154
Strategic Response Unit.
Unlock the door.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.558
Come on!

09:20.294 --> 09:22.894
(keypad beeping)

09:22.896 --> 09:24.062
Boss, it's me.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.847
You at the courthouse?
Yeah.

09:25.848 --> 09:27.631
PARKER:
We've got an active
shooter there.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.767
I figured something
was up.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.068
He charged a security barrier,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.236
and he fired a gun.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.337
What's his 20?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.605
Grab Ed's gear.
Copy that.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.006
He ran down the corridor.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.274
He could be anywhere--

09:36.276 --> 09:38.743
courtroom, judge's chambers,
holding cells.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.012
Guy's mid-20s. Black.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.081
Weapon's a handgun.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.585
Oh... and he was wearing
a parole device.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.219
An ex-con.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.255
Fantastic.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.135
All right, go up to
the north exits, okay?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.170
I'm sending up Chris.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.204
SRU.
Hey.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.238
My team is on their way.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.873
How many shots fired?
One, so far.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.742
One's enough.
He say what he was looking for?

10:10.744 --> 10:12.677
Said he needed to see
one of the prosecutors.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.045
My guy didn't get his name.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.113
Probably looking
for a courtroom.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.247
How many are there?
Nine.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.882
Three on each floor.
Kid went that way.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.317
You got uniforms
on the exits?

10:19.319 --> 10:20.619
Yep.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.658
(door rattling)

10:28.395 --> 10:29.894
(door rattling)

10:29.896 --> 10:31.396
Hey!

10:34.267 --> 10:36.067
Okay, we're going to have
to set up a command post.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.936
Tell your guys to stand down.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.672
I need building plans,
I need video.
Okay.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.207
Room 240 is free.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.242
We'll send everything up.
Security video's all wireless.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.310
Up the stairs.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.045
Got ya.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.680
Left, right?

10:48.682 --> 10:49.981
Uh, second floor,
take a left.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.650
Oh, you'll need these.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.360
(woman chuckles)

11:02.362 --> 11:04.896
...last night.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.364
But I don't know
if he meant it.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.866
He was kind of drunk.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.167
It was weird.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.036
Drop the phone.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.437
(phone clatters)

11:23.116 --> 11:25.450
Put your hands up.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.419
Now put them up.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.388
Looking for a man
named Dan Cheznik.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.023
Do you know where he is?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.192
I don't know.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.960
I'm sorry, I don't know.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.462
Look, you work
here, don't you?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.030
Yes, but not with him.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.773
(phone thudding down stairs)

11:53.113 --> 11:54.112
(gasps)

11:54.114 --> 11:56.014
Everything okay, folks?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.048
He's got a gun.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.383
Turn around,

11:58.385 --> 11:59.718
get out of here now

11:59.720 --> 12:01.419
or I will kill her.
I swear I will.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.889
I said get out of here.

12:04.891 --> 12:09.828
Okay, you know what,
I'm just working security.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.897
So I'm just going to go
ahead and set this down.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.932
Take the clip out.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.268
Put it right
here, okay?

12:17.270 --> 12:21.740
Just, uh... tell me
what you want.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.441
I want to talk
to Dan Cheznik.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.176
The lawyer, right?

12:25.178 --> 12:27.479
Okay, well, you know...

12:27.481 --> 12:30.248
you know what, I got a cell
phone in my pocket.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.317
I've got the keys
to the building.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.186
Let me just... let me just
call my boss here, and...

12:35.188 --> 12:37.355
we'll see if we can
find him for you, okay?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.091
Okay.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.893
But you do
anything stupid,

12:41.895 --> 12:44.462
and I will shoot her,
right here, right now.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.765
I promise you I will.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.300
I hear you.
I hear you.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.469
I'm just going to reach
in my pocket here,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.404
get my phone, call my boss,

12:53.406 --> 12:55.173
okay?

12:55.175 --> 12:56.541
That's all.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.042
(phone dialing)

12:58.044 --> 13:00.979
It's okay.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.316
(siren wailing)

13:07.521 --> 13:10.121
(phone ringing)

13:10.123 --> 13:11.523
Parker here.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.091
Boss, hey, it's me.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.059
Yeah, I'm in a stairwell

13:15.061 --> 13:16.227
off the third floor

13:16.229 --> 13:17.495
with a young man...
What's your name?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.798
Forget my name.
Ask about Cheznik.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.033
Young man?
What are you saying, Ed?

13:22.035 --> 13:23.568
Are you telling me you're
with the subject now?

13:23.570 --> 13:26.938
Yeah.
Okay, hang tight. We're right
outside the building.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.441
We're looking for a... for a
prosecutor named Dan Cheznik.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.243
You got your gun, Ed?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.311
No, no, no.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.414
it's C-H-E...

13:36.416 --> 13:38.817
Are you telling me
that he's got you at gunpoint?

13:38.819 --> 13:40.619
That's right, yeah.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.420
We just need a location for the
young man and the lady here.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.488
Okay, he's got a hostage?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.940
Correct.

13:44.941 --> 13:46.391
Do you want the team on
immediate action plan?

13:46.393 --> 13:47.458
Just give me yes.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.460
No... no.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.929
He's a prosecutor.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.431
Okay, just stay on the line
with me, Ed.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.933
Tell him you'll
call him back.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.002
Boss, I'm going to have
to call you back.

13:58.004 --> 14:01.072
Okay.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.846
Stairwell off
the third floor.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.981
The guy's got
two hostages.
One's a young woman.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.417
How do we know?
'Cause Ed's
the second hostage.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.386
Guys, he doesn't have
his gun with him.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.988
Oh, no.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.233
Okay, Ed's asking for
a deliberate action plan.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.401
A 20 on a lawyer named
Dan Cheznik.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.438
Wordy, first priority--
let's find Dan Cheznik.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.873
He's the target.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.040
On it.
Jules, you're on
the subject.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.409
Pull all
profiles on guys

14:38.411 --> 14:40.011
wearing parole bracelets.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.045
Okay, let's find out

14:41.047 --> 14:42.413
who this guy is.
Got it.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.015
Spike, you and Lewis...

14:44.017 --> 14:46.117
Kira, we got a guy here on
parole wearing a bracelet.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.652
Mid-20s, black. We need an I.D.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.388
KIRA: Jules, can you send a snap
from the security footage video?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.958
Okay, he's charming,
he's good-looking.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.261
Ed's going to be fine.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.929
(phone ringing)
Let's go.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.430
Hold up.
Hold up.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.099
Hey, buddy. You okay?

15:01.101 --> 15:02.634
Boss, any luck
for my friend here?

15:02.636 --> 15:03.968
No, we're still working on that.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.670
Can you stay on
the line with me?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.972
They're working on it.
It's just going to take a sec.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.507
I'm just going to stay...
stay on the line here

15:09.509 --> 15:10.575
and get some information.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.877
No, no, hang up.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.178
Tell them to call you back
when they know where he is.

15:15.181 --> 15:19.017
Boss, I'm going to need you
to call me back.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.018
Copy that.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.053
Just stay cool, okay?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.288
Slow him down.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.523
Put him on our time, okay?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.629
Copy that.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.932
Where can I find Cheznik?

15:33.934 --> 15:34.999
Cheznik...

15:35.001 --> 15:36.267
He's prosecuting
the Frasano case.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.468
That's Courtroom Seven,
third floor.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.670
Room's already
been locked down.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.138
What's the best way up there

15:40.139 --> 15:41.605
without getting near my guy
in the stairwell?

15:41.608 --> 15:42.674
Rob will take you up.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.442
Rob.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.544
Okay, you can tell
your guys to fall back.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.479
We'll take care of it
from here. Thanks.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.315
Clear out a courtroom.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.450
We contain him
inside there.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.652
You know what, let's stick
with Courtroom Seven.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.987
Two birds with one stone.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.622
Gotcha. We get the
prosecutor out of there

15:57.624 --> 15:59.390
while we prep it for
tactical options.
That's good.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.025
Plus we tell the kid
one less lie.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.527
You know the layout here?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.029
Any windows?

16:04.030 --> 16:05.530
There's a bunch of windows
looking out on King's Court,

16:05.532 --> 16:06.698
but you'll never see
through them.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.066
That's all right,
we'll take care of it.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.067
We'll get the subject contained,

16:09.069 --> 16:10.068
we'll settle him down.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.525
Wordy, you're team leader.

16:11.526 --> 16:12.981
Let's come up with
tactical options,

16:12.982 --> 16:14.437
and just let me know
when the room's clear, okay?

16:14.441 --> 16:15.740
All right, let's go.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.314
He's going to call back, right?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.749
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.051
He'll call back.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.389
(sighs)

16:31.391 --> 16:33.057
So, uh...

16:33.059 --> 16:35.626
this prosecutor must have...

16:35.628 --> 16:38.129
must have really done
something bad to you, huh?

16:38.131 --> 16:41.766
To get you to pick up a gun
and come back in here

16:41.768 --> 16:44.035
and risk your life.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.742
What were you convicted of?

16:50.744 --> 16:53.011
Murder, okay?

16:53.013 --> 16:56.114
He convicted me
of murder.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.787
PARKER: Guys, we can't stall
him much longer.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.225
(phone ringing)

17:07.227 --> 17:09.594
Answer it!

17:11.498 --> 17:12.563
Yeah.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.665
Okay, Courtroom Seven. For real.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.034
We're clearing it out now,

17:16.036 --> 17:17.135
so stall him.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.703
Take it slow.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.270
We're looking at the
building plans right now.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.673
He doesn't have a location on
the prosecutor yet, all right?

17:22.675 --> 17:23.775
But he's trying.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.777
Plan A, less lethal.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.678
Working on a surprise entry.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.114
What's he saying?
He's working on it,
he's working on it.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.282
Just give him a second.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.450
Plan B, lethal

17:32.452 --> 17:34.152
from across the court.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.453
The frosted windows
looking west.

17:35.454 --> 17:36.753
We're going to need
to use thermal.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.056
You copy that?

17:38.058 --> 17:39.424
Yeah.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.125
Okay, we've already
got video.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.161
We'll lay in
the audio.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.196
Look for an earwig
on the prosecutor's table.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.531
What is he saying?

17:46.533 --> 17:48.132
Okay, okay...
What is he saying?!

17:48.134 --> 17:49.100
It's Courtroom Seven.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.234
Courtroom Seven.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.803
Which floor?
Show me. Let's go.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.471
(whimpering)
All right,
she's scared, all right?

17:53.473 --> 17:55.440
You're making it worse.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.175
Walk now!

17:57.177 --> 17:58.810
Just put the gun down.

17:58.812 --> 18:01.179
Put the gun down
and you can take me

18:01.181 --> 18:03.181
instead, okay?

18:03.183 --> 18:06.117
Take me instead.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.286
Cuff him.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.354
It's fine.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.090
Now!

18:12.092 --> 18:13.091
It's fine.
Cuff him.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.292
I'll take the two of you.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.359
It's fine.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.395
Come on.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.200
If he's not in that room
when I get there...

18:30.643 --> 18:33.244
It's okay.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.847
It's okay.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.682
Move.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.119
Your attention please.
I'm Officer Wordsworth,

18:41.121 --> 18:42.820
Police Strategic
Response Unit.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.889
Which one of you
is Dan Cheznik?
That'd be me.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.424
All right, come with me.
The rest of you

18:46.426 --> 18:47.992
on your feet.
Leave your things.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.559
We need you to clear
this room immediately.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.600
Okay, so Dan Cheznik's one
of the top senior prosecutors

18:55.602 --> 18:57.135
in the country.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.170
15 years at the bar.
Hundreds of cases.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.905
Near perfect conviction record.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.241
PARKER:
They're on the move.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.742
Oh, my God,

19:04.744 --> 19:07.678
they got Ed handcuffed.
What the hell
are you doing there?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.580
Guys, we need you
to move fast.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.849
We'll answer all your questions
outside.

19:11.851 --> 19:12.917
All right, they're almost

19:12.919 --> 19:14.352
at the courtroom.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.587
Still a half dozen
people in there.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.156
Lewis, how's audio?

19:18.158 --> 19:21.325
Done. Earwig's on the table.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.196
Okay, subject is in
the corridor,

19:25.198 --> 19:26.931
seconds away.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.500
Spike, let's go.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.902
Wait...

19:30.904 --> 19:34.372
Hey, no. Up.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.876
They're at the door.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.945
Up. You can't be here.
I'm scared...

19:40.947 --> 19:42.313
Five seconds.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.447
Go.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.849
You don't get it, do you?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.884
I have nothing left. I'm
not afraid to use this.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.619
I will kill you both,
leave you both lying here.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.687
I do not care anymore.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.823
Okay, come here.
That's it.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.560
Come on, buddy, just buy
us a minute here.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.928
Buy us a minute here, huh?

19:56.930 --> 19:59.397
Come on, stop screwing around.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.831
Go!
I got it.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.811
(door closes)

20:13.813 --> 20:15.246
(bolting door)

20:16.849 --> 20:17.982
You lied.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.284
MICHAEL:
You said he'd be here.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.752
And they told me
he would be.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.287
I thought he would be.
You lied!

20:23.289 --> 20:24.822
You lied
just like everybody else!

20:28.528 --> 20:31.696
This wasn't supposed to happen,
oh, my gosh!

20:31.698 --> 20:34.599
He came into the courthouse
with a gun looking for you,

20:34.601 --> 20:36.000
and you have
no idea who he is?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.568
That could be anyone.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.570
You remember every
bad guy you've arrested?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.606
Any idea why
he'd go after you?

20:41.608 --> 20:43.307
Sure. Same reason
I live in a bunker,

20:43.309 --> 20:44.775
drive home in
an armored car.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.577
I'm a prosecutor
who does his job well.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.579
(sighs)
Look--

20:48.581 --> 20:51.249
just so you know, that's
my teammate staring down

20:51.251 --> 20:52.750
the long end
of this guy's gun.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.786
So, I'd appreciate it if you
think real hard about this.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.522
Let's start over.

20:58.524 --> 21:03.327
Any hate mail recently,
any threatening phone calls?

21:03.329 --> 21:04.929
(computer trilling)

21:04.931 --> 21:06.931
CALLAGHAN:
Okay, thanks,
it's downloaded.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.484
Boss, we have an ID.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.036
Subject is Michael Jameson,
26 years old, released

21:12.038 --> 21:13.871
from Kingston Penitentiary
12 weeks ago.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.090
What'd he do?

21:16.091 --> 21:18.308
1997, raped and murdered
one Katie Bakerton.

21:27.987 --> 21:28.986
You--

21:28.988 --> 21:30.638
you're gonna get
your cell phone,

21:30.639 --> 21:32.289
you're gonna call the police,
and you're gonna tell them

21:32.292 --> 21:34.175
that they have 15 minutes

21:34.176 --> 21:36.059
to deliver Cheznik to me,
or one of you dies!

21:36.062 --> 21:38.396
Do it!

21:52.445 --> 21:54.745
PARKER:
<i> All right, guys,</i>
<i> it's five to 12:00.</i>

21:54.747 --> 21:56.297
We've got a 15-minute deadline.

21:56.298 --> 21:57.848
Spike, Lewis,
where are we in Plan A?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.917
Looking for a point of entry
to the balcony.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.018
Might be a rooftop.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.753
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.055
Copy that,
if that's the only way in.

22:04.057 --> 22:05.589
Sam, Wordy, where's Plan B?

22:05.591 --> 22:06.691
Cheznik's on his way down.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.792
We're heading into position.

22:07.793 --> 22:08.892
We'll let you know
when we're there.

22:08.895 --> 22:09.894
Copy that.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.829
Got an ID on the girl he kills.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.897
Katie Bakerton.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.105
They, uh...

22:21.107 --> 22:22.373
said they were

22:22.375 --> 22:24.642
looking for him...
all right?

22:28.114 --> 22:29.847
ED:
They said they're going to call
any minute.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.749
(whispering):
Move towards him.
I'm a cop.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.750
Move towards him.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.052
Distract him
for a second.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.654
Just for a second.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.722
Hey! What are you doing?

22:37.724 --> 22:38.756
I don't know.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.658
Stop talking.
Don't move!

22:42.428 --> 22:45.129
ED:
All right, why don't you
just tell me you name.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.131
May-maybe I can help you.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.899
All right, what is it,
a payback?

22:48.901 --> 22:49.900
Is it revenge?

22:49.902 --> 22:51.635
I don't want revenge.

22:51.637 --> 22:54.572
PARKER (over radio):
Ed, if you hear me, look up.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.573
All right, buddy.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.674
Okay.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.259
Just keep him contained

22:58.260 --> 22:59.843
close to the balcony,
we'll drop from there.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.980
You stole a gun,
you come in here, and...

23:02.982 --> 23:04.982
you're telling me
you don't want revenge?

23:04.984 --> 23:07.852
I want my name back.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.687
And I want to know how they
got a confession out of me

23:09.689 --> 23:12.056
when I never confessed.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.424
Two years, I've been waiting
for the file to show up:

23:14.427 --> 23:15.826
the government's case
against me.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.561
Well, today it did.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.797
And now my lawyer's telling me
that the file isn't there.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.600
Now, I need to talk to the man
that put me away,

23:22.602 --> 23:24.602
and I want him to look me
in the eye

23:24.604 --> 23:25.936
and tell me what happened.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.805
PARKER:
Just got...
just keep him talking.

23:27.807 --> 23:31.008
And try to find a point
of connection.

23:31.010 --> 23:34.178
I've got Dan Cheznik here.
Bring him in.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.850
I hear you.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.852
And you know what, you and me,
we're not that different.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.188
Something happened
a couple of months ago.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.090
I did something,

23:46.092 --> 23:50.461
and I... I keep having
to defend it.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.764
Defend what I did.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.765
PARKER:
Name's Michael Jameson; you
convicted him of the murder

23:55.768 --> 23:58.869
of Katie Bakerton.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.838
Katie Bakerton?
When was that?

24:00.840 --> 24:01.772
Ten years ago?

24:01.774 --> 24:02.873
Eleven.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.809
It was a brutal murder.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.877
Okay, all right,
got it, thanks.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.146
Here's the criminal
index report.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.081
Ten minutes to deadline, Jules.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.084
Find out who his lawyer is.
Get him on the phone.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.086
His lawyer?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.455
Alpha Team, what's your 20?

24:17.457 --> 24:20.090
Broaching blue, Alpha One.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.992
Top of the world.
Copy that.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.962
Ed, Spike and Lewis
are on their way. Stand by.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.964
Bravo Team, where are you?

24:26.966 --> 24:30.034
Ma'am, we need the room.
Please come with me.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.805
Almost same position.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.006
How's Ed?

24:36.008 --> 24:37.374
He's hanging in there.

24:37.375 --> 24:38.741
He's trying
to get this kid to open up.

24:38.744 --> 24:43.914
Maybe... maybe I look at myself
differently, too.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.516
It's like...

24:45.518 --> 24:48.052
I know exactly what
happened that day.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.020
I remember perfectly.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.890
And my brain keeps
playing tricks on me

24:52.892 --> 24:58.896
and I start to go over it
and over it in my mind

24:58.898 --> 25:05.035
and asking myself if maybe...

25:05.037 --> 25:07.104
I remember it differently.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.774
ED:
If maybe
I was wrong.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.977
I did that for 11 years.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.781
They charged me as an adult,

25:17.783 --> 25:20.851
but I was 15
when they put me away.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.989
Never finished high school,
never had a job...

25:24.991 --> 25:26.991
never kissed a girl.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.295
And I don't know anything
about anything,

25:31.297 --> 25:33.931
but I know
what happened that day,

25:33.933 --> 25:36.033
and I know I didn't kill Katie.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.037
Okay, boss, we're
on the back roof.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.839
We should be at the vent soon.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.724
Copy that.

25:43.725 --> 25:45.608
ED:
Why don't you...
why don't you tell me about her?

25:45.611 --> 25:47.611
What was she like?

25:47.613 --> 25:49.980
She's amazing.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.788
Incredible smile.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.559
She didn't have to be,
but she's nice to everybody.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.695
Didn't matter what kind of
family you had,

26:04.697 --> 26:06.096
house you lived in,

26:06.098 --> 26:08.632
she just saw you.

26:08.634 --> 26:11.869
So I showed up the first day
at school,

26:11.871 --> 26:16.073
and I'm 12, the only black kid
in the class...

26:16.075 --> 26:18.642
It's like they'd never
seen it before.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.946
The kids are whispering
and moving their desks.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.280
And I'm feeling like

26:23.282 --> 26:26.283
I just want to fall into a hole
and disappear.

26:26.285 --> 26:31.655
Well, she comes right over
and she sits beside me,

26:31.657 --> 26:35.693
smiles and tells me
we're going to be friends.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.761
And just like that,
we're friends.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.731
She was raped,
dumped in the woods,

26:40.733 --> 26:42.733
tied her ankles,
tied her wrists,

26:42.735 --> 26:47.137
slid her throat,
covered her face with a T-shirt.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.706
Couldn't stand to see
what he'd done.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.642
Just like that, best friends.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.678
Three years...

26:54.680 --> 26:57.114
Three years we
were best friends

26:57.116 --> 27:00.184
until..
I fell in love with her.

27:00.186 --> 27:03.320
All the evidence
pointed to Michael.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.822
She was killed
with a knife;

27:04.824 --> 27:06.123
he had a knife
that fit the specs.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.158
She was raped
before she was killed.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.827
Well, we knew
from Michael's transcript

27:09.829 --> 27:13.030
he had said
he wanted more from Katie.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.732
Did Katie feel the same way?

27:14.734 --> 27:17.735
I don't know.

27:17.737 --> 27:22.906
The day I told her,
we rode to the park,

27:22.908 --> 27:25.676
she was sitting on the back
of my bike,

27:25.678 --> 27:28.312
I was swerving,
she was laughing.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.248
MICHAEL:
We were having
such a great time.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.318
Just being together.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.420
Just us.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.856
Man, it was a perfect day.

27:41.394 --> 27:44.862
And then I just said it.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.998
I mean, I told her I loved her.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.067
What did she say?

27:50.069 --> 27:52.169
She said I was sweet.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.104
She leaned against me,
kissed m on the cheek,

27:54.106 --> 27:57.374
and she asked me
to give her a ride.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.243
Who's the girl on the right?

27:59.245 --> 28:01.111
And I said yes.

28:01.113 --> 28:05.349
I doubled her... doubled her
to the corner near her house.

28:05.351 --> 28:09.787
She wanted me to drop her off.

28:09.789 --> 28:13.323
And he was the last person
to see her alive.

28:15.227 --> 28:17.961
And that was the last time
you saw her?

28:17.963 --> 28:20.731
Yeah.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.000
I remember this.

28:23.002 --> 28:27.271
I remember seeing her picture
in the paper.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.276
I'm so sorry.

28:32.278 --> 28:36.046
(sniffling)

28:36.048 --> 28:39.249
11 years in the joint, this guy
still sounds like apple pie.

28:39.251 --> 28:42.019
Yeah, well,

28:42.020 --> 28:44.788
psychopaths, they spend years
perfecting their stories.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.225
Sarge, I just got off the phone
with Michael Jameson's lawyer.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.227
He backs it up. He says

28:50.228 --> 28:52.228
all the evidence against
this guy was circumstantial,

28:52.231 --> 28:53.363
and he confirms that

28:53.365 --> 28:55.866
the material was missing
from his file.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.843
Bravo Team in position.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.444
Frosted windows,
limited joy.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.280
Stand by.
We're five minutes away.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.983
WORDY:
That one's Ed.
You see the cuffs?

29:12.985 --> 29:14.218
SAM:
I've got the suspect.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.086
I could take him right now.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.388
WORDY:
We don't fire
on a thermal image.

29:18.390 --> 29:21.959
We need to see
the guy for real.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.961
Okay.

29:23.963 --> 29:28.532
Boss calls Scorpio?
First shot's mine, on the glass.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.434
You're a split second later
on the subject,

29:30.436 --> 29:32.136
as soon as you've confirmed
it's him.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.403
Copy that.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.806
So the case against this guy,

29:35.808 --> 29:37.975
what'd you have on him?

29:37.977 --> 29:39.309
You name it.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.779
Well, that's what I'm asking.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.181
Hey, who's on trial here?

29:44.183 --> 29:46.216
I'm not the one
waving the gun around.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.052
Okay, but my guys are in there
facing a gun

29:49.054 --> 29:51.455
because this kid came after you,
and I'd kind of like

29:51.457 --> 29:53.857
to understand what it is
that's pissing him off.

29:53.859 --> 29:56.827
You need me, I'll be outside

29:56.829 --> 29:58.707
calling my attorney...

29:58.708 --> 30:00.586
Sir, you do not leave
that hallway.

30:00.587 --> 30:02.465
You stay with security.
I may have more questions.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.306
(door closes)

30:09.308 --> 30:11.408
Hey, Jules, get Michael's lawyer
back on the phone.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.577
Let's find out what this
Cheznik isn't telling us.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.245
JULES:
I'm on it.

30:15.247 --> 30:18.415
PARKER:
Alpha team, what's going on?
Where are you?

30:18.417 --> 30:20.217
We're two minutes away
from deadline.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.052
(whispering):
It's gonna be tight.

30:22.054 --> 30:27.991
ED:
So you sat up there
and you told your story

30:27.993 --> 30:30.527
and, what, you thought the jury
would believe you?

30:30.529 --> 30:31.461
That's a good boy, Eddie.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.164
Just keep walking him back

30:34.166 --> 30:35.499
till he's right
underneath the balcony.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.434
They did.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.368
Until Cheznik puts some
guy on the stand,

30:39.371 --> 30:42.005
some guy that'd been
in a holding cell with me

30:42.007 --> 30:43.373
for five minutes.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.210
And he gets up there
and he tells the jury

30:46.212 --> 30:47.377
that I confessed to him.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.313
That I told him
that I killed her.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.281
Is there anything
in Michael's file

30:51.283 --> 30:53.383
that shows wrongdoing
on the part of the prosecution,

30:53.385 --> 30:55.185
anything at all?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.387
No. Anything that might've
incriminated Cheznik is gone.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.489
What about other cases
this guys prosecuted?

30:59.491 --> 31:00.858
I'll need some time.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.329
So this guy says
that you confessed to him.

31:07.132 --> 31:09.266
What did you say?

31:09.268 --> 31:10.901
Nothing. Not a word,
not even a hello.

31:10.903 --> 31:12.302
And that's what you
told the jury?

31:12.304 --> 31:15.606
Yeah, but this guy, he knew
stuff about how she died.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.241
Things that only the
killer would know.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.876
Things that I
didn't even know.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.179
PARKER:
Talk to me, Lewis.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.231
(whispering):
Almost there.

31:24.232 --> 31:26.282
Ed, one minute
till the shooter's deadline

31:26.285 --> 31:27.651
and Alpha needs more time.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.887
You need to buy us more time.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.989
So that's why
you wanted the file.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.357
But none of it
was there. Okay?

31:33.359 --> 31:35.359
Cheznik made sure of that.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.028
All right, you have got
to forget about Cheznik.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.030
Okay, and confronting him
at gunpoint

31:40.032 --> 31:43.033
is not gonna convince anyone
of anything.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.669
If you're innocent,
put the gun down.

31:45.671 --> 31:50.274
A gun never solved anything.
Believe me.

31:50.276 --> 31:53.477
The police are probably out
there right now with a sniper.

31:53.479 --> 31:58.115
I know how they work.
So, I'm asking you--

31:59.618 --> 32:04.922
I am begging you,
I am<i> begging</i> you--

32:04.924 --> 32:06.323
just put the gun down.

32:12.097 --> 32:12.996
No, it's over.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.398
No.
You get over

32:14.400 --> 32:16.400
next to him and put
your hands up.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.401
Now!

32:17.403 --> 32:18.435
(sniffling)

32:18.437 --> 32:19.436
Spike, he's escalating.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.437
Where are you?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.371
(whispers):
15 seconds away.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.390
That's not good enough.

32:23.391 --> 32:25.408
Now. I need you now.
I need you now.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.476
Bravo Team has it.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.445
No, I don't wanna go lethal.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.613
I don't want to go lethal.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.548
Alpha Team, I'm watching you.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.383
Are you set?

32:33.385 --> 32:34.952
Your time is up.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.654
(whispering):
We're set, boss.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.156
Go, go, go.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.661
BOTH:
Police! Put the gun down now!

32:44.663 --> 32:46.296
Put it down now!
Drop the weapon!

32:46.298 --> 32:47.464
(coughing)
You okay?

32:47.466 --> 32:49.433
You're okay.
You're okay.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.601
He's got her.
He's got her, he's got her.

32:51.603 --> 32:52.602
They're clear. They're safe.

32:52.604 --> 32:53.570
ED:
Come on, come on.

32:53.572 --> 32:54.671
They're safe.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.274
You son of a bitch.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.344
(panting)

33:05.718 --> 33:08.051
Okay, where's the subject?
Where's, uh...

33:08.053 --> 33:10.587
Where's Michael Jameson?

33:20.299 --> 33:22.699
That's why I looked up.
I didn't know.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.434
You're all right.
You're okay.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.069
Cuffs off.
Get these cuffs off.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.571
You did great.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.441
Are you okay?

33:31.443 --> 33:33.677
I'll be all right
when that kid gets out of there.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.779
I've been on the phone
with his lawyer.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.748
The kid was right,
the case was a disaster.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.182
What do you mean,
a disaster?

33:39.184 --> 33:40.250
Get a load of this.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.787
If you won't let me
talk to Cheznik

33:43.789 --> 33:45.689
then give me a tape recorder.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.759
Subject turns to suicide.
12:11 PM.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.794
Michael's asked
for a tape recorder.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.129
All right, Lewis.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.064
Just take it easy,
just talk to him.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.699
Okay, it's coming.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.534
It's coming.
They're working on it.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.303
All right? Please,
stay calm, all right?

34:00.305 --> 34:01.805
If you could lower that
gun a few inches...

34:01.807 --> 34:03.040
Mm-mm.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.643
CHEZNIK:
No, they...
That's him.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.045
still won't let me go.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.746
Are you listening
to me?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.415
Make sure it's
recording.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.150
What did I
just say?

34:13.152 --> 34:15.552
What did I just
tell you?

34:15.554 --> 34:18.722
Excuse me, sir, if I could
just talk to you for a second,

34:18.724 --> 34:20.257
I gotta get back in there.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.291
Well, they got you out.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.292
What's going on?

34:22.294 --> 34:24.494
Listen, I've got
to call you back.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.229
If I could just get
this straight.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.532
So it's a young girl who
was raped and murdered,

34:28.534 --> 34:31.601
and the public was looking
for somebody to hang, right?

34:31.603 --> 34:32.803
They always are.

34:32.805 --> 34:35.372
And the only real
suspect is this kid,

34:35.374 --> 34:38.675
and all you got on him
is circumstantial?

34:38.677 --> 34:39.810
JULES:
Are we picking this up?

34:39.812 --> 34:41.095
Yeah.

34:41.096 --> 34:42.379
ED:
Nobody's gonna want
to take that case.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.313
CHEZNIK:
That's right.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.515
ED:
It's a no-win.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.651
So, you do what it
takes to make the case.

34:47.653 --> 34:50.821
You know what?

34:50.823 --> 34:52.289
I get it.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.692
The system's rigged
against the good guys.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.494
You do what you gotta do.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.129
I hear you.

34:59.131 --> 35:01.131
Like, like...

35:01.133 --> 35:03.400
give an informant the details
of a murder, that kind of thing?

35:03.402 --> 35:07.104
How many years did you knock off
this guy's sentence?

35:07.106 --> 35:09.806
'Scuse me.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.808
What about the
eight other cases

35:11.810 --> 35:14.845
you used jailhouse informants
to get "confessions"?

35:14.847 --> 35:16.279
Get your hand off me.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.347
Happily.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.616
I make no apologies
for what I did.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.819
Those were good cases.
They were tough cases.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.654
No one else could've gotten
those convictions.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.823
They knew that, that's...

35:26.825 --> 35:28.125
That's what?

35:28.127 --> 35:30.494
Why they made you
a senior prosecutor,

35:30.496 --> 35:32.295
a month after that kid
went to jail?

35:38.837 --> 35:41.805
Hey, Ed. Nice work.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.673
Is what he said
enough to nail him?

35:43.675 --> 35:46.309
No. No, but the whole thing
might be enough

35:46.311 --> 35:47.544
to get this kid an appeal.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.578
Jules is working on it.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.813
I'm going in to tell him.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.581
Boss, I...

35:51.583 --> 35:54.551
Let me have the vest.
Okay?

35:54.553 --> 35:56.186
Ed, you can't just
keep putting yourself

35:56.188 --> 35:57.420
in the middle
of this thing.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.923
That's not how we
work, you know that.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.279
What is this?

36:05.280 --> 36:06.730
You think this is
some way to atone,

36:06.732 --> 36:09.366
you save this kid, you get
to take it all back?

36:09.368 --> 36:11.801
I'm not trying
to take it back.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.237
Ed. Eddie.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.953
Okay, this is Strategic Response
Unit officer Ed Lane.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.757
You're a cop?

36:33.759 --> 36:34.958
Yes, I am.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.661
I need you to listen to me.

36:37.663 --> 36:41.665
I got Cheznik, on record,
admitting

36:41.667 --> 36:44.935
that he would do whatever
it took to get a conviction.

36:44.937 --> 36:49.940
Your lawyer says there may be
as many as eight similar cases.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.908
With the evidence he has,

36:51.910 --> 36:53.944
it's enough for an appeal.

36:54.947 --> 36:56.279
So, just...

36:56.281 --> 36:59.416
just put the gun down, okay?

37:02.221 --> 37:04.321
Nobody dies today.

37:05.257 --> 37:08.225
Nobody dies today, okay?

37:08.227 --> 37:13.263
What you... what you
were saying about...

37:13.265 --> 37:15.932
going over
something in your brain?

37:15.934 --> 37:18.468
Yeah?

37:18.470 --> 37:22.005
In prison, I went over
a lot of things.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.974
But there was this one thing

37:23.976 --> 37:27.944
that I... I kept asking myself
over and over.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.948
I asked myself why Katie
didn't want me

37:31.950 --> 37:33.917
to drop her at home that day,

37:33.919 --> 37:37.854
why she wanted me
to drop her at the corner.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.326
She didn't love me.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.330
She wanted me to drop her
at the corner

37:47.332 --> 37:50.033
because she was meeting
someone else.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.636
She had a date.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.504
Oh, my God.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.040
Whoever she was meeting,
that's who killed her.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.643
It had to be.

37:59.645 --> 38:04.347
I promised her, the first time
I went to her grave,

38:04.349 --> 38:06.783
that I would prove
I was innocent--

38:06.785 --> 38:09.052
not for myself but for her.

38:12.324 --> 38:18.061
So they'd start... they'd start
to look for him, whoever he is.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.996
So justice would be done.

38:19.998 --> 38:23.300
I promise you...

38:25.704 --> 38:27.671
we're gonna make sure
that happens.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.540
And you will get
your appeal.

38:33.312 --> 38:35.045
Nobody dies today, okay?

38:38.350 --> 38:39.416
That's it.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.585
Put your hands on your head.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.726
(handcuffs jingling)

39:02.474 --> 39:04.507
You know, you never
told me your name.

39:06.111 --> 39:07.844
My name's Michael Jameson.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.614
Michael Jameson.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.689
It's all right.

39:25.063 --> 39:28.064
(engine starts)

39:28.066 --> 39:31.134
¶ ¶

39:32.371 --> 39:34.437
You all right?

39:34.439 --> 39:35.672
I'm good, good.
