01:22.506 --> 01:24.531
Looks like the old man
has been working out!

01:24.709 --> 01:27.075
Jor-El and I have an understanding.

01:27.244 --> 01:28.541
I'm taking you home.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.773
I don't care what he's done to you.
You're not taking me anywhere.

01:48.599 --> 01:49.930
Clark!

01:53.037 --> 01:57.269
You don't realize how dangerous you are
when you're wearing that ring.

01:58.342 --> 02:00.810
It's not the ring. I was born that way.

02:00.978 --> 02:03.139
You just can't accept it.

02:53.831 --> 02:56.766
What in the hell did Jor-El
do to you, Clark?

02:56.934 --> 03:00.995
He made sure I'd never forget
who my real father is.

03:17.188 --> 03:18.450
Go on.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.285
Do it.

03:21.459 --> 03:27.193
If I could raise a son
that could kill, then kill!

03:48.452 --> 03:49.783
Dad.

03:51.722 --> 03:53.781
Dad? Dad.

03:55.893 --> 03:57.588
Clark.

03:57.761 --> 03:59.251
Dad.

05:10.501 --> 05:12.526
-Clark.
-Mom.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.671
Oh, Clark!

05:15.606 --> 05:17.198
Mom.

05:18.909 --> 05:22.208
I am so sorry, Mom, for everything.
For the baby--

05:22.379 --> 05:24.973
We never blamed you.

05:29.253 --> 05:30.777
-Oh, my God!
-Dad.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.719
-What happened?
-Whatever Jor-El did...

05:33.891 --> 05:36.052
...must've been too much
for his body to handle.

05:36.226 --> 05:39.684
The important thing is that Clark is
back home with us now.

05:52.142 --> 05:56.511
Abraham threw lsaac on the pyre
to prove his faith to God.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.340
What was your excuse?

06:02.052 --> 06:03.383
Lex?

06:06.223 --> 06:08.088
Son.

06:08.659 --> 06:11.389
Disappointed I'm not basking
in the fires of hell?

06:11.562 --> 06:12.824
Lex...

06:13.797 --> 06:15.264
...put the gun down.

06:15.466 --> 06:17.400
Sorry I screwed up your plan.

06:18.035 --> 06:21.334
Why would I murder
my own flesh and blood?

06:21.972 --> 06:23.599
Son...

06:24.108 --> 06:28.545
-...you're not yourself.
-I'm feeling more like myself than ever.

06:28.712 --> 06:30.873
What the hell did you do with Helen?

06:31.048 --> 06:33.209
She's living very comfortably
in your mansion.

06:33.384 --> 06:35.215
Why don't you ask her.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.120
-She's alive?
-Yes.

06:39.289 --> 06:42.486
And she told a truly harrowing
tale of survival...

06:42.660 --> 06:45.686
...that left you
quite the posthumous hero.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.957
She said the pilot took your money
and bailed out.

06:49.133 --> 06:52.034
-Lex, we're going down!
-There must be parachutes!

06:54.571 --> 06:57.404
There's only one. Come on!

06:57.574 --> 06:59.303
I'm not going without you!

07:01.945 --> 07:04.743
Count to three and pull.
They'll send a rescue plane for you.

07:05.015 --> 07:06.846
Lex.

07:07.184 --> 07:08.446
I love you.

07:12.523 --> 07:14.081
Now, go.

07:15.459 --> 07:17.552
Quite a story, don't you think?

07:17.728 --> 07:21.596
A sacrificial death that would make
any father proud.

07:21.765 --> 07:26.202
But something tells me that's not
what really happened, Lex.

07:28.205 --> 07:32.198
-I warned you not to trust her, Lex.
-Don't turn this on Helen!

07:33.143 --> 07:35.304
You had my name carved into a tombstone!

07:35.479 --> 07:38.505
I had search parties scouring
half the world for you.

07:38.782 --> 07:41.148
Looks like you picked the wrong half.

07:41.785 --> 07:44.720
What would I have to gain from your death?

07:46.156 --> 07:47.418
Lex.

07:47.591 --> 07:52.392
As your widow, Helen just became
one of the richest women in the world.

07:52.563 --> 07:54.155
Helen never cared about the money.

07:54.331 --> 07:57.459
Oh, but she did, Lex.

07:58.802 --> 08:03.899
Ask her what happened to the vial with the
blood sample after you returned it to her.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.240
Dad, I just don't get it.

08:12.850 --> 08:14.715
Why would Jor-El help bring me back...

08:14.885 --> 08:17.217
...when he's the one
who wanted me to leave?

08:21.158 --> 08:23.786
You made a deal with him, didn't you?

08:23.961 --> 08:25.223
Clark...

08:25.863 --> 08:30.800
...the most important thing right now
is that my son has his life back.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.404
I'm not sure I want it back.

08:39.275 --> 08:42.039
And being Kal-El,
I could just do whatever I wanted.

08:42.212 --> 08:45.181
It was like this huge weight
had been lifted off me.

08:45.349 --> 08:49.285
Look, I'm not saying that staying
is gonna solve all your problems...

08:49.453 --> 08:53.048
...but at least this way we can face it
together as a family.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.726
I wish it were that easy.

08:59.329 --> 09:00.694
What is that?

09:00.864 --> 09:02.525
I don't know.

09:03.634 --> 09:06.330
This guy, Morgan Edge,
hired me to steal it.

09:06.503 --> 09:10.098
-Clark, you gotta take this thing back.
-Dad...

09:10.274 --> 09:12.970
...I stole it from Lionel Luthor.

09:18.816 --> 09:22.308
We better find out exactly what it is
we're dealing with.

09:31.094 --> 09:33.324
That's my blood, isn't it?

09:46.610 --> 09:49.204
It's your blood.

09:49.379 --> 09:52.075
Do you think Lionel knows?

09:52.249 --> 09:56.982
Helen told me she never labeled it
before somebody stole it from her office.

09:57.154 --> 09:59.213
Why would Lionel want my blood?

10:01.425 --> 10:02.915
It doesn't matter now.

10:05.128 --> 10:07.528
I'm starting to wonder
what he really knows about me.

10:07.698 --> 10:10.758
We've managed to stay
one step ahead of Lionel Luthor so far.

10:10.934 --> 10:14.631
Why don't you just focus on people
closer to home, okay?

10:21.311 --> 10:23.245
I like Scotch.

10:23.413 --> 10:27.850
-What's this?
-It's our old special. A Suicide.

10:30.187 --> 10:32.678
I hope your tastes haven't changed.

10:33.857 --> 10:36.587
Nothing ever changes, Lionel.

10:36.860 --> 10:42.093
Not even when you dress it up
in a designer suit or a penthouse office.

10:42.266 --> 10:46.828
Yeah, it's sad the same thing
can't be said about friendship.

10:48.372 --> 10:53.241
I kind of suspected you had an inside
contact, but I gotta hand it to you.

10:53.410 --> 10:55.241
Very creative.

10:57.915 --> 11:00.110
Buying off my daughter-in-law...

11:00.284 --> 11:02.275
...that's even low for you, Morgan.

11:02.786 --> 11:04.276
Oh, well.

11:07.591 --> 11:10.583
All right, all right,
let me guess, let me guess.

11:10.761 --> 11:14.629
The idea was to steal the vial
and sell it back to me...

11:14.798 --> 11:17.323
...at a healthy markup, right?

11:17.501 --> 11:20.732
What are you gonna do, have me
charged with breaking and entering?

11:20.904 --> 11:25.500
Why settle for breaking and entering?
I can have you put away for good.

11:26.376 --> 11:28.344
I'd be careful, Lionel.

11:30.747 --> 11:32.806
-You've got a lot further to fall.
-Yeah.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.008
But I'm the one who's got the evidence.

11:35.185 --> 11:41.488
And remember, the statute of limitations
on murder never runs out.

11:42.826 --> 11:45.624
You got 24 hours to get that vial
back to me.

11:58.809 --> 12:01.243
-Hi.
-Hi?

12:02.879 --> 12:05.507
I don't even know
what to say to that, Clark.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.789
I'm sorry...

12:14.958 --> 12:18.018
...for the way I acted in Metropolis.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.629
I really messed things up.

12:23.834 --> 12:26.496
I keep telling myself that it wasn't you.

12:26.670 --> 12:27.932
But...

12:28.105 --> 12:32.439
...then I think back on all the things
that have happened, and I realize...

12:32.609 --> 12:35.510
...that I don't know who you really are.

12:40.984 --> 12:44.044
I know you need an explanation.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.189
No, I don't.

12:47.090 --> 12:50.548
You warned me there were things
about you that I wouldn't understand.

12:52.996 --> 12:55.658
I guess I just didn't want to believe it.

13:00.270 --> 13:02.568
I was protecting you.

13:02.739 --> 13:04.604
From what?

13:05.475 --> 13:07.943
That's the part I can't figure out,
because, Clark...

13:08.111 --> 13:12.172
...the only thing
that keeps hurting me is you.

13:19.122 --> 13:22.489
After everything you said
before you left...

13:26.863 --> 13:29.161
...did you even miss me?

13:32.836 --> 13:35.031
I missed you every second.

13:42.779 --> 13:45.304
But I can't keep doing this to you.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.613
Then don't.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.596
Lana, I'm not sure if I'm even gonna stay.

14:11.775 --> 14:15.006
Well, when you decide, let me know.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.448
Home sweet home.

14:53.049 --> 14:57.008
Lex. Oh, thank God!

14:57.220 --> 14:59.711
Trust me, I've done that already.

14:59.890 --> 15:02.882
He seems to be the only one
on my side lately.

15:05.028 --> 15:07.792
But the rescue, it was called off. How...?

15:07.964 --> 15:10.262
Small fishing boat spotted the smoke
from my fire.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.901
I never gave up hoping.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.995
Just in case, it was certainly generous
of you to make me out to be a hero.

15:17.174 --> 15:20.200
I'm so sorry, Lex.
I shouldn't have lied to everyone.

15:21.278 --> 15:23.576
-So why did you?
-I just couldn't face...

15:23.747 --> 15:26.079
...what really happened up there.

15:29.452 --> 15:32.285
I woke up to find the pilot parachuting
from the plane...

15:32.455 --> 15:35.390
...just like I told everyone.
I couldn 't wake you.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.221
Lex! Lex!

15:38.395 --> 15:40.659
I realized you drank a whole glass
of champagne...

15:40.830 --> 15:44.027
...and I only had a sip.
We must've been drugged.

15:45.035 --> 15:48.163
The plane was going down, and I panicked.

15:49.139 --> 15:53.872
You always think that you're gonna be
brave in a situation like that...

15:54.044 --> 15:59.448
...but when it really happens, I guess,
your survival instincts kick in.

15:59.616 --> 16:01.584
Survival of the fittest.

16:02.452 --> 16:05.046
I guess you really are a Luthor now.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.651
You don't believe me?

16:10.827 --> 16:12.920
I know you worked for my father.

16:14.331 --> 16:17.858
After I gave you the blood back
and apologized...

16:18.034 --> 16:20.400
...you turned around and sold it to him.

16:20.570 --> 16:23.767
Your father said if I gave him the blood,
he'd leave us alone forever.

16:23.940 --> 16:26.340
He's playing us against each other.

16:27.344 --> 16:30.074
We seem to do a good job
of that on our own.

16:32.649 --> 16:37.552
If you want to annul this marriage,
I'll get out of your life.

16:46.796 --> 16:49.060
But for what it's worth...

16:52.002 --> 16:54.766
...I do love you.

17:25.835 --> 17:30.863
I must admit, this is the last place
I expected you to show up.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.407
How'd you find me?

17:33.576 --> 17:37.376
-Where's my package?
-I don't have it.

17:40.183 --> 17:43.209
I wonder if the cops want to know
where you are.

17:46.890 --> 17:49.017
I don't think you heard me!

17:51.961 --> 17:53.428
The package is gone!

17:53.596 --> 17:56.326
Luthor doesn't know who took it,
so forget about it!

17:56.499 --> 17:58.558
Take your hands off of him right now!

17:58.735 --> 18:00.225
I said, now!

18:03.940 --> 18:08.707
Take your sorry ass down the road
back to Metropolis.

18:09.412 --> 18:12.404
I don't want to see you
in Smallville again. Ever.

18:47.283 --> 18:49.843
Kind of far from your new hood,
aren't you, Clark?

18:53.022 --> 18:55.388
I just came to say thank you.

18:55.558 --> 18:56.957
Oh, it's one of those days.

18:57.127 --> 19:02.565
Because I can never tell with you whether
it's gonna be an apology or an accusation.

19:04.100 --> 19:07.900
Chloe, I gave you absolutely no reason
to stand by me.

19:08.805 --> 19:11.205
But you knew where I was
all summer and didn't tell.

19:11.374 --> 19:14.172
Yeah, well, that's what friends
do for each other, Clark.

19:15.879 --> 19:18.006
Talk to Lana yet?

19:23.319 --> 19:25.014
I tried.

19:26.022 --> 19:27.489
That's it?

19:28.591 --> 19:32.960
After two years of nonstop Lana-lusting,
that's the best you can do? Come on.

19:33.963 --> 19:35.555
I think it's for the best.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.362
You're not staying, are you?

19:43.406 --> 19:45.169
I haven't made up my mind yet.

19:45.341 --> 19:47.502
You can't keep running away, Clark.

19:47.677 --> 19:49.167
We all do things we regret.

19:49.345 --> 19:53.179
Sometimes you have to stop
and face your demons.

20:10.099 --> 20:12.795
Am I too early for the farm auction?

20:15.505 --> 20:17.200
Lex?

20:17.740 --> 20:20.334
Three months on a deserted island
was almost worth it...

20:20.510 --> 20:22.978
...to see the look on your face right now.

20:27.784 --> 20:29.081
Oh, man!

20:30.920 --> 20:33.115
Lex, we thought you died.

20:33.289 --> 20:35.723
Well, apparently, fate has
bigger plans for me.

20:37.126 --> 20:39.390
I heard about the farm.

20:39.562 --> 20:41.154
Anything I can do?

20:41.331 --> 20:43.731
No, Lex, you know my dad.

20:47.237 --> 20:49.102
It's good to see you.

20:50.173 --> 20:52.334
What happened?

20:52.509 --> 20:54.807
Something I didn't know I was capable of.

20:55.845 --> 21:00.373
It's ironic. In the most remote solitude,
I still manage to find an enemy.

21:00.917 --> 21:04.216
I suppose I was just hallucinating
from malaria.

21:04.387 --> 21:06.685
But the enemy I found was real.

21:07.690 --> 21:09.885
I got a good look at myself.

21:10.059 --> 21:12.857
Or at least the part
I've always tried to ignore.

21:16.132 --> 21:17.531
Lex, l--

21:17.700 --> 21:21.500
I guess we all gotta take a look
at our dark side sooner or later.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.168
The problem is,
if you stare at it long enough...

21:27.343 --> 21:29.743
...it can get hard to tell the two sides apart.

21:39.222 --> 21:40.553
Hey.

21:43.359 --> 21:45.953
-You can't keep avoiding me, Lana.
-I'm not avoiding you.

21:46.129 --> 21:48.256
I worked late,
and I ran errands this morning.

21:48.431 --> 21:50.160
At 5¡G30 in the morning?

21:51.367 --> 21:54.962
You want to cut the pretenses? Fine.
You lied to me about Clark.

21:55.138 --> 21:57.698
Something we have in common, then.

21:57.874 --> 22:02.436
I have apologized to you 1 00 times
for not telling you about Clark and me.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.079
You're right, and I'm over it.

22:04.247 --> 22:06.306
So let me say I'm sorry.
We can call it even.

22:06.482 --> 22:09.940
Chloe, this is so much bigger than me.
How could you let everyone worry?

22:10.119 --> 22:13.054
Because the more pressure I put on him,
the more he pulled away.

22:13.222 --> 22:14.484
I mean, you saw him, Lana.

22:14.657 --> 22:18.354
He wasn't the charming flannel king we
all know and love. It was like he was--

22:18.528 --> 22:20.155
A different person.

22:20.330 --> 22:21.797
Yeah.

22:21.965 --> 22:26.368
Let's face it, Lana,
Clark has more issues than Rolling Stone.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.266
Look, I know what I did was wrong.

22:34.677 --> 22:36.611
And as much as I hate to admit it...

22:36.779 --> 22:41.045
...it felt really good being
the person he confided in again.

22:43.419 --> 22:47.150
Clark's always been more comfortable
talking to you.

22:47.323 --> 22:49.382
It's because he's not in love with me.

22:55.031 --> 22:57.090
That didn't take long.

22:57.500 --> 23:01.698
I thought I'd leave for a while,
give you some space to think things over.

23:02.872 --> 23:04.134
Hey.

23:06.142 --> 23:09.543
I've had more than enough space
the last few months.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.379
I'd rather share it with someone.

23:13.950 --> 23:16.680
I thought we can give the honeymoon
a second try.

23:18.454 --> 23:20.854
You don't let go of things, Lex.
I know you.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.686
Yes, you do.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.819
You and I understand each other
because we're similar creatures.

23:27.997 --> 23:30.397
We've both done our share
of maneuvering.

23:30.767 --> 23:34.726
In a twisted way, I guess that's
why we're perfect for each other.

23:34.904 --> 23:37.839
I want to be with you, Lex.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.940
But you know your father
will never leave us alone.

23:43.112 --> 23:45.012
Don't worry.

23:45.181 --> 23:49.379
I have a feeling he won't be
interfering in our lives anymore.

23:55.758 --> 23:59.091
-Hey, Mom! Dad!
-Yes, Kal.

24:01.798 --> 24:03.925
Didn't I tell you not to ever
come back here?

24:04.100 --> 24:08.503
I wanted to meet the parents.
Nice people.

24:09.605 --> 24:13.803
-Mom.
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.770
Clark! Son.

24:18.414 --> 24:20.314
Don't do anything. It's okay.

24:20.483 --> 24:24.852
I know you're quick, but you can't
get to both of them at the same time.

24:29.692 --> 24:32.058
I don't have what you're looking for.

24:32.228 --> 24:36.028
Do you want me to explain that
to Lionel Luthor?

24:37.600 --> 24:40.194
-No, Clark--
-Wait!

24:41.671 --> 24:42.968
Stop.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.500
Clark!

25:57.880 --> 25:59.871
What the hell is this?

26:00.616 --> 26:03.050
It's what you're looking for.

26:04.220 --> 26:05.619
It better be.

26:28.077 --> 26:30.705
Extraordinary how the smell
of creosote and algae...

26:30.880 --> 26:33.508
...can take you back 30 years, isn't it?

26:35.218 --> 26:39.086
-A lot of memories buried here.
-Yeah, where they belong.

26:41.524 --> 26:44.652
Don't tell me I've come
all the way out here for nothing.

26:48.598 --> 26:50.532
Intriguing presentation.

26:51.100 --> 26:54.069
It's not the packaging that is important.

26:54.237 --> 26:57.673
-Unless you don't trust me.
-Trust you?

26:57.840 --> 27:01.606
Trust has never had anything
to do with our friendship.

27:25.534 --> 27:27.058
It's identical.

27:27.236 --> 27:29.170
Excellent.

27:35.244 --> 27:39.078
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think the blood was liquid gold.

27:40.149 --> 27:43.118
I can't imagine what the real source
would be worth to you.

27:43.653 --> 27:45.814
Unfortunately,
the source is a mystery to me.

27:45.988 --> 27:50.789
My contact turned out to be,
let's say, uncooperative.

27:51.394 --> 27:53.555
They were holding out on you.

28:03.139 --> 28:08.133
What if I were to tell you that this is
not the sample I stole?

28:10.046 --> 28:12.947
I got this straight from the source.

28:28.564 --> 28:30.293
Jonathan!

28:33.436 --> 28:34.733
Yeah.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.431
Yes, sir.

28:37.907 --> 28:41.673
That was Edge. He wants us
to bring the kid to him.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.694
Do you know where the Kents are?

29:11.774 --> 29:13.105
Move it!

29:15.211 --> 29:16.610
Lana.

29:17.847 --> 29:20.407
Please leave her out of this.

29:54.383 --> 29:55.816
Lana.

30:01.724 --> 30:04.158
To a second chance.

30:06.295 --> 30:07.728
You're not drinking?

30:07.897 --> 30:11.025
Well, I sort of lost
my taste for champagne.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.894
Did you sleep well last night?

30:14.403 --> 30:17.668
The first good night's sleep
I've had since the accident.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.171
I'm glad.

30:19.341 --> 30:23.573
Because it is our honeymoon,
and I'd hate for you to doze off.

30:25.181 --> 30:28.014
You never know.
You might wake up to find me gone.

30:30.719 --> 30:32.550
Lex, that's not funny.

30:34.356 --> 30:36.517
I guess you had to be there.

30:39.595 --> 30:41.495
You know what?

30:41.664 --> 30:43.427
I am gonna have a drink.

30:45.601 --> 30:47.535
What's going on?

30:49.505 --> 30:53.236
I was so relieved when you forgave me
for stealing the blood...

30:53.409 --> 30:58.870
...that I failed to realize
no rational person would've done that.

30:59.582 --> 31:02.176
I did it because I love you.

31:06.455 --> 31:09.185
You still think I tried to kill you?

31:11.293 --> 31:13.887
Why can't you see what's
right in front of your eyes?

31:14.063 --> 31:17.362
It was your father's plane.
He's always been threatened by you.

31:17.533 --> 31:23.130
You're right. You see, I haven't been able
to stop thinking about the accident.

31:23.305 --> 31:26.934
And there is something that's been
right in front of my eyes.

31:29.311 --> 31:33.577
If my father wanted me dead,
he wouldn't have failed.

31:34.450 --> 31:38.511
You're experiencing residual delusions.
It's a common aftereffect of the malaria.

31:38.687 --> 31:42.418
I'm afraid I've been delusional
a lot longer than three months.

31:42.925 --> 31:46.019
But I think I have a pretty clear
picture of things now.

31:47.096 --> 31:51.260
You had my father's pilot killed
and snuck your own on board.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.568
You had the pilot touch down
on a small island and drop you off.

31:57.006 --> 32:01.568
You paid him a prearranged sum to take
the plane up again with me still inside.

32:05.181 --> 32:07.809
He flew out far enough
to cover your tracks...

32:07.983 --> 32:11.384
...and then he took a little skydive.

32:11.554 --> 32:15.991
I'm guessing he had a pretty ugly surprise
when he tried to open his parachute.

32:17.726 --> 32:21.628
Believe me, I prefer your version,
where I'm the gallant hero...

32:21.797 --> 32:24.595
... but that' s not giving you
enough credit, is it?

32:24.767 --> 32:26.166
Lex, you're scaring me.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.326
The area where we crashed
was unreachable...

32:28.504 --> 32:32.497
...given the amount of fuel we started with.
I checked all the islands in the vicinity.

32:32.675 --> 32:36.736
You touched down on St. Croix
at 7:59 that night.

32:37.413 --> 32:40.405
You know what the most
twisted part of all this is?

32:43.953 --> 32:47.081
Is the reason you didn't get a bullet
in your head that day...

32:47.256 --> 32:50.748
...was because I really did
fall in love with you.

32:52.628 --> 32:54.118
But don't worry.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.126
I learn from my mistakes.

33:01.937 --> 33:03.234
Go ahead.

33:04.473 --> 33:07.033
I've become quite adept
at cheating death.

33:08.077 --> 33:12.480
In fact, I have no doubt
that I'll rise from the ashes again.

34:33.228 --> 34:35.196
I hate mysteries.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.831
-Or did you forget that?
-You're gonna like this one.

34:47.242 --> 34:48.937
This had better be worth it, Morgan.

35:05.361 --> 35:07.556
We gotta get you out of here.

35:07.996 --> 35:09.463
You set me up!

35:09.631 --> 35:12.794
-You set me up!
-Lionel, I don't know what happened!

35:12.968 --> 35:14.629
You set me up!

35:14.803 --> 35:18.899
There was nobody in that truck!
There was nobody in that truck!

35:36.525 --> 35:38.584
Mr. Luthor, I gotta get you out of here.

35:39.128 --> 35:41.528
-Morgan.
-Let's go, Mr. Luthor!

35:41.697 --> 35:43.164
I've gotta get you out of here!

35:43.332 --> 35:46.859
Where is he? Where's Morgan?

35:47.035 --> 35:48.730
Go!

36:17.166 --> 36:19.031
Well done, Lex.

36:19.201 --> 36:20.691
Well done.

36:21.303 --> 36:25.501
That was a Machiavellian maneuver
worthy of a Luthor.

36:25.674 --> 36:28.734
I appreciate the kudos, but I don't
know what you're talking about.

36:28.911 --> 36:34.406
Come on, Lex, do you think I'd neglect
to put surveillance on my planes?

36:36.852 --> 36:38.444
Poor Helen.

36:38.620 --> 36:41.350
Should we be sending out
a search party for her?

36:41.523 --> 36:43.423
I have someone on it.

36:44.326 --> 36:48.695
But if Helen survived, I doubt anyone
will find her until she wants them to.

36:49.331 --> 36:54.769
You know, Lex, I never imagined
that you would fall in love with Helen.

36:55.137 --> 36:58.766
I'm sorry it happened, son,
but don't be too hard on yourself.

37:01.043 --> 37:02.772
You know the sick thing?

37:05.247 --> 37:09.650
Of all people, I knew you'd understand.

37:09.818 --> 37:11.080
I do.

37:11.253 --> 37:13.653
Survival is what matters in life.

37:13.822 --> 37:15.790
I know that now.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.557
If I was anybody's else son,
I would've died on that island.

37:22.664 --> 37:24.689
All the tests you put me through...

37:25.868 --> 37:27.927
...made me a survivor.

37:29.771 --> 37:33.298
If I can keep my pride in check,
I know there's more to learn from you.

37:37.312 --> 37:41.214
I was hoping your offer still stands
to run LuthorCorp together.

37:45.888 --> 37:50.416
I don't want you making
a hasty decision, Lex.

37:50.592 --> 37:53.254
You've just been through
an incredibly traumatic ordeal.

37:53.428 --> 37:55.123
No.

37:55.297 --> 37:58.357
I've learned to trust my instincts.

38:09.811 --> 38:11.836
Good to have you back.

38:13.482 --> 38:14.881
Son.

38:29.731 --> 38:32.029
It won't seem right
calling any other place home.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.828
It's not the place
that makes the home, Dad.

38:35.003 --> 38:36.903
Does that mean you're coming with us?

38:37.072 --> 38:40.508
I've kind of closed the door
on my time in Metropolis.

38:42.678 --> 38:46.512
I called the police and told them
where the money is that I stole.

38:47.783 --> 38:52.413
You can't run away from the problem
when the real problem is in your blood.

38:53.155 --> 38:54.588
Hey.

38:54.756 --> 38:57.122
Clark, don't be so hard on yourself.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.059
Hi, Lex.

39:01.797 --> 39:05.995
You missed the garage sale. But we have
tons of these macrame plant holders left.

39:06.168 --> 39:09.069
Thanks, Clark, but I'm actually
doing my own share...

39:09.237 --> 39:11.262
...of purging around the mansion.

39:20.582 --> 39:23.346
-You bought our farm?
-I put your names in the deed.

39:23.518 --> 39:26.612
-We can't accept this.
-Accept nothing but my gratitude.

39:26.788 --> 39:29.951
-Lex--
-After the plane went down...

39:30.125 --> 39:32.992
...I made my way onto
one of the broken wings.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.796
This compass, your wedding present...

39:38.967 --> 39:40.935
...guided me to safe harbor.

39:41.203 --> 39:44.468
The least I can do is help you
keep your farm.

39:49.778 --> 39:52.440
We will find a way to pay you back.

39:53.115 --> 39:55.948
I'm not worried about that, Mr. Kent.

39:56.118 --> 39:58.313
If it's not too presumptuous...

40:00.122 --> 40:03.091
...I hope you'll just consider me
part of the family.

40:26.214 --> 40:27.579
Hi, Lana.

40:31.153 --> 40:34.122
Glad your parents are getting
a second chance.

40:35.057 --> 40:39.084
Yeah, I think I'll be earning every cent
of my allowance this year.

40:39.261 --> 40:40.888
So you're staying?

40:42.564 --> 40:46.898
I think I wanna try to put all the stuff
that happened in Metropolis behind me.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.936
Probably be a good idea if we put
a lot of things behind us.

40:50.772 --> 40:52.467
I was just thinking that too.

40:54.276 --> 40:59.213
Clark, I know there are things about you
that you try to shield me from...

41:00.716 --> 41:03.378
...but you don't have to protect
me anymore.

41:06.955 --> 41:09.287
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

41:11.126 --> 41:13.651
I really want to know you.

41:19.768 --> 41:24.398
Lana, the way you looked
at me in Metropolis....

41:24.573 --> 41:27.736
-You were disgusted.
-No, I was confused.

41:27.909 --> 41:31.140
-You can't blame me for that.
-I don't blame you.

41:33.081 --> 41:35.982
But I can't stand for you to ever
look at me that way again.

41:36.151 --> 41:38.779
You weren't yourself.

41:40.455 --> 41:41.786
Yes, I was.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.462
Lana, I chose to let that part of me out,
and it's always gonna be there.

41:50.999 --> 41:54.662
Trust me, you don't want to know me
the way you think you do.

41:55.637 --> 41:58.401
Clark, that's my decision to make.

42:01.877 --> 42:03.504
Lana, I'm sorry.

42:06.515 --> 42:07.777
I wanted this so much.

42:07.949 --> 42:11.885
All last year, I tried so hard
to be the right guy for you.

42:19.227 --> 42:20.592
But I'm not.

42:22.731 --> 42:24.631
This will never work.

42:43.518 --> 42:46.544
Clark, you never had to try.
