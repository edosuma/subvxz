39:33.621 --> 39:35.361
I'm sorry.

39:41.254 --> 39:42.664
For what I did.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.255
Oh, it was stupid.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.384
Yeah.
And I almost lost you because of it.

39:49.929 --> 39:53.296
And the idea of that--
That I would never see you again....

39:53.474 --> 39:55.089
I know, babe.

39:55.977 --> 40:00.437
J‘ You're wearing me down J‘

40:00.648 --> 40:03.025
Oh, my God. I felt it.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.233
Right there.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.735
I want to keep the baby.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.951
Our baby.

Where's Rostova?

40:40.355 --> 40:42.061
Who? I don't know who--

40:42.231 --> 40:45.189
Nine days ago,
a painting was commissioned.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.273
It was sent to this address,
shipped to you. Mr. Paul Allond.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.939
Yes. |-- I'm a dealer.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.442
A private art broker.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.696
I received a call. No name was given.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.991
She said a piece had been acquired
and was nearly finished.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.501
-She asked that it be sent to me.
-For pickup.

41:05.672 --> 41:10.006
Yes. But not by her. By you.
I assume you're the one she spoke of.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.881
Reddington.
She said you would come.
