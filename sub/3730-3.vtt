- Drill. He says you're "it."

[Gasps]

00:07.300 --> 00:10.169

There was someone across the
street, watching the building.

00:19.512 --> 00:22.264
Jessup: Clearly this guy is Drill. He's
convincing the children to do stuff.

- You know who he is.

00:23.817 --> 00:24.933
It might be my husband.

00:24.935 --> 00:26.268
He was my patient last night.

00:26.270 --> 00:27.653
He doesn't remember anything.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.782
If Sean is here, why didn't he come home?

00:40.834 --> 00:44.836
Ever since you were with her,
everything has gone wrong.

00:44.871 --> 00:48.757
There's something I need to do.
You're gonna help me.

Say something.

[Sighs] I can't...

02:16.580 --> 02:19.681
I can't do this anymore.

These past two years, ever since Henry's...

Don't. Don't blame me for that.

I don't. I don't. I don't.

God, Sean, when did it get
so hard to talk to you?

02:31.727 --> 02:32.810
I don't know, Claire.

02:32.845 --> 02:34.779
Why don't you ask your conscience?

02:34.830 --> 02:38.549
You can't just volunteer for a mission...

02:38.601 --> 02:41.202
- And leave.

is gonna fix anything...

Please.

Answer me one question...

Do you love him?

03:24.980 --> 03:26.247
No.

03:26.281 --> 03:28.332
But you had to think about it.

03:30.819 --> 03:34.522

He's alive.

05:03.127 --> 05:05.212
It sounds crazy, but I'm not crazy.

05:05.214 --> 05:08.615
I saw him.

05:08.666 --> 05:12.519
And he saw me, too.

05:12.570 --> 05:15.472
Only it was like...

05:15.506 --> 05:19.559
It was like he was
looking through me, like...

05:19.594 --> 05:21.828
Like he didn't even know who I was.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.732
I talked to a doctor
who treated him two days ago.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.634
She said that... [Sniffles]

05:27.668 --> 05:30.237
that clearly he's
experiencing some kind of...

05:30.271 --> 05:33.040
of memory loss.

05:33.091 --> 05:37.144
At least that explains
why he didn't come home.

05:40.098 --> 05:42.015
This wouldn't be the first time he didn't.

05:42.017 --> 05:45.285
No, that was different, Mom.

05:45.287 --> 05:47.254
He blamed himself
for what happened to Henry,

05:47.288 --> 05:49.473
and he just... he couldn't...

05:49.524 --> 05:50.674
no,<i> he</i> didn't
blame himself... you did.

05:50.825 --> 05:55.028
Decisions are easy.

05:56.581 --> 05:58.331
It's living with the consequences

05:58.366 --> 05:59.633
that's the hard part.

05:59.635 --> 06:03.236
And for a while...

06:03.287 --> 06:06.339
Neither of us was very good at that.

06:06.341 --> 06:09.276
Sean was not a perfect husband.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.879
Yeah. God knows I was not a perfect wife.

06:12.881 --> 06:18.468
But, he... Mom, he's back, and...

What they are saying about him,
what they think he's done...

And Agent Bennigan,
where's her head on this?

07:13.757 --> 07:15.408
Well, she hasn't come in.

07:21.014 --> 07:22.715
You think she's a liability.

07:22.750 --> 07:27.220
I think any involvement
would be seriously imprudent.

This one's yours.

Thank you, sir.

But let me just put a little
perspective on this for you...

07:36.146 --> 07:37.947
you're hunting down a man thought to be

07:37.981 --> 07:40.316
the deceased husband
of one of your colleagues.

07:40.367 --> 07:42.485
Whether he is in fact guilty,

07:42.536 --> 07:45.488
your investigation will bare that out.

07:45.539 --> 07:48.124
But let's save the judgment
on Agent Bennigan.

at a place Sean Bennigan was a month ago?

08:46.466 --> 08:48.600

of the suspect was last night.

Is he a good listener?

11:38.871 --> 11:40.621
And what else?

11:42.574 --> 11:44.842
He doesn't keep secrets from me.

11:44.844 --> 11:47.478
He always tells me the truth.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.082
And that's important to you,
knowing the truth?

11:52.885 --> 11:55.470
But you can't actually
see Drill. Isn't that right?

11:55.521 --> 11:57.355
Why does everyone care about that?

12:11.236 --> 12:12.837
But Drill said he needed me

12:12.839 --> 12:14.505

12:14.556 --> 12:18.209
Minx... Now, you're 8 now.

12:18.243 --> 12:20.661
You know the difference

12:23.498 --> 12:26.650
You don't have to invent friends, Minx.

12:26.685 --> 12:29.770
There are a lot of people,
real people in your life,

12:29.805 --> 12:31.389
who want to be there for you.

12:31.423 --> 12:33.724
But Drill needs me.

12:33.726 --> 12:36.610
No. Drill's not real.

12:36.645 --> 12:39.780
Do you understand what
I'm trying to tell you, Minx?

12:41.283 --> 12:43.601
That I should stop playing with Drill

12:43.635 --> 12:45.903

where someone's going...

Turns out, maybe he was right.

14:01.982 --> 14:03.282
What do you mean?

14:03.284 --> 14:05.751
Well, two minutes before he
was killed, he sent an e-mail.

14:05.785 --> 14:08.354
Somehow it got corrupted
in transit, bounced back,

14:08.388 --> 14:10.289
never reached the intended recipient.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.424
The main body of the e-mail
was un-retrievable,

14:12.459 --> 14:16.195
but the attachment...
We managed to salvage this.

14:16.229 --> 14:17.830
What exactly am I looking at here?

14:17.832 --> 14:19.932
We're not sure, but check out who

14:19.934 --> 14:21.734
the recipient of the e-mail
was supposed to be...

14:21.768 --> 14:23.369
page three.

Uh, the... The commission

28:56.753 --> 28:58.386
will send inspectors to each facility,

28:58.421 --> 29:01.022
but we need to know
where Sean is headed today.

29:01.024 --> 29:03.458
Okay.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.593
Okay, let's...

29:05.595 --> 29:07.061
Think like him.

29:07.063 --> 29:08.763
He uses kids, right?

29:08.861 --> 29:10.861
But not just any kids. He
chooses them carefully.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.376
They all have access or
information that he wants.

29:14.960 --> 29:15.954
Okay, well, how does he get them to help?

29:15.988 --> 29:18.306
Brainwash, bribery...

29:18.340 --> 29:20.558
No, that's how this...

29:24.346 --> 29:25.730
I don't know how Sean does it,

29:25.764 --> 29:28.883
but each of these kids claims
to have a friend named Drill

29:28.918 --> 29:30.168
that no one else can see.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.902
It's further. It's further.
It's further. It's further on.

30:04.953 --> 30:07.088
Just go further.

30:07.090 --> 30:09.390
What do you think you're seeing?

30:09.392 --> 30:10.775
I can't explain it.

30:10.826 --> 30:13.077
It's like déjÃ  vu. I just...

30:14.880 --> 30:17.648
It just feels familiar.

30:17.683 --> 30:21.369

31:16.891 --> 31:20.561
How about I ask <i>you</i> a question?

31:20.563 --> 31:23.664
Why did you have a gun in your house?

31:23.666 --> 31:25.499
You afraid of somebody?

31:27.886 --> 31:30.604
The only person I'm scared of right now

I know who you are.

31:54.070 --> 31:55.855
You do?

31:55.906 --> 31:58.040
You're the lady who makes Mommy cry.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.795
This is our home.

32:02.846 --> 32:04.396
You brought that woman into our home.

32:04.431 --> 32:06.999
Minx might be our only chance
of finding out where Sean is.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.101
I didn't have a choice. I'm sorry.

32:09.152 --> 32:10.185
<i>He</i> did.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.787
He chose to use Minx
because of what you did...

32:11.821 --> 32:13.389
what both of you did.

32:13.423 --> 32:17.209
I swear to you, if anything
happens to my little girl...

32:17.260 --> 32:20.262
I'm sorry.

32:21.831 --> 32:24.683
I am.

But grown-ups...

32:27.337 --> 32:28.420
[Sighs]

32:28.471 --> 32:32.708
We make mistakes, sometimes big ones.

32:32.759 --> 32:36.161
I am trying my best to make up for it.

32:36.196 --> 32:40.682
And we can talk about that
some other time if you want to,

32:40.733 --> 32:42.951
but right now I have to ask you
some important questions.

32:42.953 --> 32:45.487
- I need to know about Drill.
- No.

32:45.522 --> 32:48.073
Drill's not real.

You know that's not true, don't you, Minx?

33:06.242 --> 33:08.126
You know that Drill is real.

33:08.177 --> 33:10.562
He asked you to play a game, didn't he?

33:10.613 --> 33:14.466
What did he ask you to do?

33:16.953 --> 33:19.037
You're just trying to confuse me.

33:19.088 --> 33:22.991
I just need the truth, Minx.

33:22.993 --> 33:25.093
Tell me about this game.

33:27.146 --> 33:31.466
We played lots of games, but not anymore.

33:31.501 --> 33:34.419
I stopped talking to him, and he got mad.

33:34.453 --> 33:36.538
Maybe if I stop talking to you,

33:36.572 --> 33:37.856
you'll go away, too.
