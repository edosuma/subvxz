<i>Reid Janssen, kicks things off</i>

00:46.403 --> 00:48.892
<i>with an exhibition of skiing
that we've come to expect from him.</i>

01:09.726 --> 01:12.515
<i>it's the only thing,

01:12.595 --> 01:14.017
<i>Each instructor is determined to prove</i>

01:14.097 --> 01:16.353
<i>that he and his ski school section
are the best,</i>

<i>head instructor for Section 8,
is preparing to do just that,</i>

from Reid's pre-pageant ski exhibition.</i>

their ski school recruits before them,</i>
