00:14.056 --> 00:17.351

00:21.188 --> 00:23.232
‐ Me? No...

00:28.946 --> 00:30.072
Sorry, what's that?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.782
‐ He's hammered.
‐ Fuck, I'm hammered.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.367
Shouldn't have driven here.
‐ You didn't.

Look at this wild cat.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.668
‐ Bonnie, they have you
making beer runs now?

00:42.668 --> 00:44.419
‐ Fuck no. Ain't trying be no beer runner.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.255

‐ She in it to win it?

00:46.255 --> 00:48.257
‐ She lost the bet.
‐ What for?

00:48.257 --> 00:50.467
‐ I said Tavares would have
a slow start with the Leafs.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.718
‐ And I still say if the Leafs think

00:51.718 --> 00:53.262
I'm paying a buck twenty

00:53.262 --> 00:54.721
they can sucks my babcock.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.223
‐ Sharp coat, bud.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.808
‐ Thanks, Wayne.
‐ Can I borrow it?

00:57.808 --> 00:59.852
‐ You've got plenty to keep
you warm in that turtleneck.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.395
Looks cozy.
‐ Hey, you wanna try it on?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.771
‐ I've gotta go to work.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.356
Bye, Daryl.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.485
‐ Aren't you supposed to be
driving to Quebec later?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.279
‐ Me? No.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.865
No, Marie‐Fred picked up a shift there,
so... in Quebec.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.074
‐ So, let's drink eight beers.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.617
WAYNE:
Fuck, I'll have eight beers.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.119
‐ Speaking of driving to Quebec...

01:17.119 --> 01:18.245
‐ Look at this big cat.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.080
‐ Oof. Wayne!

01:20.080 --> 01:22.040
I could set your breath
on fire from all the way over here.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.792
‐ He's hammered.
‐ He's in it to win it.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.835
‐ I'd have a beer.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.920
‐ Aren't you supposed to be
courting your Mennonite tonight?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.380
‐ Ooh, Lovina Dyck.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.215
‐ Lovina Dyck's parents are out of towns,

01:30.215 --> 01:33.260
and you needs parental supervisions
to courts a Mennonite gal.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.887
‐ So, what's a Mennonite's
favorite kind of raisin?

01:34.887 --> 01:36.680
‐ What?
‐ Barn raisin'.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.556
[muffled laugh]

01:37.556 --> 01:39.641
‐ Well, it's a great day for eight.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.767
Beers.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.352
‐ Looks like Wayne's
already had eight beers.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.396
‐ Me?
‐ He's eight'n to exhale.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.522
‐ Better eight than never.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.483
‐ Now, why would anybody want to
sit down and drink eight beers's?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.693
‐ He's in it to win it.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.153
‐ Eight will get the rig rollin'.
‐ Fuckin' A.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.654
‐ <i>Je ne comprends pas,</i> Daniel.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.698
‐ Let's say your buddy comes
over to have a beer.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.533
So you have a beer,
maybe you have a couple beers.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.076
But you're gonna stop at a couple of beers

01:58.076 --> 01:59.536
'cause if you have six beers,

01:59.536 --> 02:01.038
well, then you might
as well just be honest

02:01.038 --> 02:02.581
and admit you're gonna
get fucking hammered.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.916
‐ Nah, fuck six, seven beers.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.334
‐ <i>Je ne comprends toujours pas.</i>

02:05.334 --> 02:06.919
‐ If you say you're gonna
have a couple beers,

02:06.919 --> 02:08.003
you stop at a couple beers.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.463
But if you're more likely to lean into it,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.089
like we are today,
well, then you get real...

02:11.089 --> 02:12.299
‐ You get real.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.218
‐ You get real and you say,
"I'm gonna have eight beers."

02:14.218 --> 02:15.969
‐ Fuck, McMurray was talkin' about
having eight beers.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.429
‐ McMurray's a piece of shit.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.140
‐ Why would anybody want to sit
and just drink eight beers's?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.434
The bloat of it.
‐ He's in it to win it.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.395
‐ Fuck, Dary, have a beer.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.190
‐ Do youse remember when
I was talking about driving to Quebec?

02:28.190 --> 02:29.441
‐ Oh, I remember that.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.068
It was right when I
entered the conversation.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.361
I only caught a ribbon of it,

02:32.361 --> 02:34.404
but I'm dying for the rest to unfurl.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.697
‐ Well, I got news for youse.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.783
‐ Hope it's better than
McMurray's news for youse.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.077
‐ Fuck, anything's better than
McMurray's news for youse.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.037
"And I..."

02:42.037 --> 02:43.705
‐ I'm driving to Quebec.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.040
‐ Good fishin' in Quebec.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.291
‐ Great fishin' in Quebec.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.835

02:49.920 --> 02:51.797
‐ Fuck off, Dary.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.507

03:01.640 --> 03:03.100

03:04.017 --> 03:05.060
GLEN:
You're mine now.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.938
‐ You here.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.149
I believe the expression is,
"Give your balls a tug."

03:11.149 --> 03:13.277
‐ She's angry.
‐ She's in it to win it.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.820
‐ Dary, if you drive to Quebec

03:14.820 --> 03:17.072
to beg a woman who cheated
on you to come back,

03:17.072 --> 03:18.574
I will punch you in the stomach.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.409
‐ Yeah, get him right in
the processor, Katy.

03:20.409 --> 03:23.745
‐ Well, there's no evidence
that she cheated on me, that I know of.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.748
She was just going back to Jean‐Claude.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.875
[grunts]

03:27.875 --> 03:29.543
‐ Fuck, Katy got him
right in the processor.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.671
‐ So, Dary, you think that
she made that decision,

03:32.671 --> 03:35.215
came to tell you,
and then went back to him.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.384
‐ That's what I was hoping for.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.594
‐ Dary, where do you think she was

03:38.594 --> 03:40.262
for those two weeks
that you couldn't reach her?

03:40.262 --> 03:42.723
‐ Taking racy Instagram photos. Yew!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.641
‐ Yeah, there's proof of that.
‐ Yew!

03:44.641 --> 03:47.436
‐ She was fucking him.
‐ That's a bad word.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.021

04:14.755 --> 04:16.048
and gets any respects.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.132

DAN: No.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.551
Nots in a small town.

04:32.356 --> 04:33.607
No exceptions.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.026

04:37.986 --> 04:40.113
But I do not back this.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.407

that I'm gonna need to
start charging you rent

05:04.137 --> 05:05.222

people with their problems.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.561
Look, if we haven't helped you,

about three dozen people in the queue.
