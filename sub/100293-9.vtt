fallen.

If it's any consolation,

it almost wiped out
the Cybermen too.

isn't good enough, is it?

how much are we talking?

Seven.

- Seven humans left?
- If I had to guess,

04:37.080 --> 04:39.240
I'd say that's the last
remaining human settlement

Yeah, I didn't have a clue
either.

As far as I understand it,

is part-human,

06:30.120 --> 06:32.000
all emotion
and sensations of pain,

06:32.040 --> 06:33.840
which means
if we can un-suppress those

06:33.880 --> 06:36.040
and they realise what's
happening to their bodies,

06:36.080 --> 06:37.320
it sends them a bit mad,

06:37.360 --> 06:38.760
which is one way
of stopping them.

There are Cybermen behind us!

12:49.680 --> 12:52.760
We're not ready.
I haven't got Feekat and Ethan.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.200
Listen to Yaz - get inside.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.760
Graham, where's Ryan?

12:59.280 --> 13:01.120
Get inside the gravraft!

13:01.160 --> 13:02.960
No, no, we've got to find
our friends!

13:05.200 --> 13:07.600
Get inside
if you want to stay alive!

13:07.640 --> 13:10.360
- Ryan!
- Get inside!

13:10.400 --> 13:12.200
Go! Expedite takeoff - now!

- Not without the others.
- The others are dead.

If they haven't got here
by now,

13:34.960 --> 13:36.080
that thing must've got 'em.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.480
Look, we've only come in here
for shelter,

13:37.520 --> 13:38.720
and our friends
are still out there.

Concentrate, Ryan,
we have to get out of here.

how to work this thing.

are you talking about?

a way out of this galaxy.

a direct route out of here,

20:07.840 --> 20:10.080
into another random part
of the universe.

will be heading.

Now, if this is warp drive,
we'll get there before them.

You're good at this.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000

How to hijack Cyberships,

21:19.560 --> 21:21.600
how to take 'em apart,

about you.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.000

21:50.040 --> 21:51.600
We will find you.

21:51.640 --> 21:52.920
Yeah, yeah. Have you not asked

21:52.960 --> 21:55.800
that great slab of Cyber AI
you absorbed about me?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.160
I'm the Doctor.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.320
Consult the Cyberium, mate.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.320
I've stopped you lot
so many times before,

22:01.360 --> 22:05.440
and I'll do it again,
time after time after time.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.160
No.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.560
The Cyberium does know you.

22:09.600 --> 22:13.200

will be destroyed,

22:13.240 --> 22:15.800
and I shall bring
the Cyber race

22:15.840 --> 22:19.000
to its greatest ever glory.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.120
Quite a grudge
you've got against humanity,

22:22.160 --> 22:24.360
especially considering
you used to be one.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.080
When the glorious
Cyber Empire arrived,

22:28.120 --> 22:31.360
I was a willing recruit.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.320
But as I took
my rightful place,

22:33.360 --> 22:35.840
as I began
my blessed ascension...

22:37.360 --> 22:39.560
...I was denied.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.240
At first...

22:45.440 --> 22:50.480
...I cursed myself,
hid in the shadows, ashamed.

22:52.040 --> 22:56.320
But now I understand
I was not discarded.

22:56.360 --> 22:59.000
I was chosen...

22:59.040 --> 23:05.120
...to revive the glory
of the Cyber race.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.880
There's no glory
in being a Cyberman.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.360
And there's definitely no glory
in you.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.880
I mean, talk about
an identity crisis.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.600
You despise who you are.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.960
That anger and hatred
that's driving you?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.520
Those are human emotions.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.720
The real Cybermen,
they don't do emotions.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.240
So you loathe your own being
because of what's driving you.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.440
Now that's what I call
an inner conflict.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.800
Yes.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.040
You are correct.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.800
Oh. Am I? I didn't expect you
to take it that well.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.560
I'll have to bill you
for therapy at this rate.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.800
The Cyberium
has given me understanding.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.560
It has distilled my purpose.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.440
I am the perfect vessel.

Everything is in me

for the ascension
of the Cybermen...

...and beyond.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.880
What do you mean beyond?

24:01.920 --> 24:03.440
What's beyond that?

24:03.480 --> 24:05.800
All your deaths.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.920

...is within me.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.440
Which way did he go?

25:30.480 --> 25:31.680
Come on.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.800
I was lucky.

There you go, look.

Now, that one at the front,
there's an opening in it,

If we could just get in there,
and get across there...

We'd never reach it.
We don't have the power.

of those systems.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.800
That's what you need -
burst of acceleration.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.080
It might work.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.600
We could vent the air pressure.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.040
It could spin us enough.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.120
We'll lose all the oxygen,
we'll be dead.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.240
We're dead anyway!

29:16.320 --> 29:18.280

- OK.
- YEDLARMI: So,

to meeting you.

That is cos you're alive
and breathing, cos of us.

Are you going to keep
going on about that?

33:39.760 --> 33:41.160
We get this working,

33:41.200 --> 33:44.200

maybe even find your friends.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.720
This'll get us to Ko Sharmus.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.760
We could even use it
to cross the Boundary.

Use it as a settlement ship

the best habitable planet.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.480
- Yeah, that could work.
- Oh, careful,

positive there for a sec.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.640
I'm going to take a look around
the rest of the carrier,

34:26.680 --> 34:28.760

Or is it morning?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.800
Loving the coastline.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.120
KO SHARMUS: Three of you.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.240
Not just one, but three of you.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.560
(SHAKILY) I don't believe it.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
There's me
having lost all hope.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.400
Consider us your hope restored.

37:52.440 --> 37:55.000
I'm the Doctor.
This is Ryan and Ethan.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.560
Do you mind
if I have a shufty around?

37:56.600 --> 37:58.680
How are your defences here?

37:58.720 --> 38:00.280
Come on.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.600
Did this settlement
start with you?

38:03.640 --> 38:05.080
Yes.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.480
Myself and handful of others...

38:08.840 --> 38:11.240
...fleeing the Cybercamps.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.400
So you fought in the war?

38:15.440 --> 38:16.880
Yes.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.280
For a long time.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.840
Then I was captured and held
in a human internment camp

38:21.880 --> 38:25.160
for processing.
Sent for upgrade.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.160
I was one of the lucky ones
who got away.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.480
We had heard tell
of this place.

38:31.520 --> 38:34.600
We didn't really believe it,
but we managed to get here.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.440
The war hadn't made it
this far,

38:36.480 --> 38:40.040
so we built shelter
and over time, others came.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.440
The word spread.

38:41.480 --> 38:44.040
So...where's everyone else?

38:45.080 --> 38:46.600
There's only me.

38:48.280 --> 38:51.480
I helped everyone else
through the Boundary.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.640
And then, cos I'm an idiot...

38:56.080 --> 38:59.720
...I felt like it was
my duty to wait...

39:00.920 --> 39:02.920
...in case others came.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.120
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

39:06.000 --> 39:07.480
But it's been a long time.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.880
You sacrificed your own life

39:09.920 --> 39:12.120
on the chance others
were still out there?

39:12.160 --> 39:14.840
You make it sound more noble
than it is.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.760
So it's true?

39:16.800 --> 39:19.360
The Boundary, it's real?

39:19.400 --> 39:21.760
Of course it's real.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.560
Will you show us?

39:25.520 --> 39:28.840
(ALARM BLARES)

39:28.880 --> 39:30.840
I think this is trying
to tell us something.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.520
Oh, no.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.600
We've been boarded.

39:41.560 --> 39:44.320
- Open the comms channel.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.320
Graham, Ravio,
head to the control deck.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.880
Cybermen just boarded.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.000
(ON COMMS) Graham, Ravio,
this is Yaz.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.120
Cybermen have boarded
and are on your level.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.160
Get back here
as quick as you can.

40:00.200 --> 40:03.360
Yaz calling Graham and Ravio,
can you hear me?

40:03.400 --> 40:04.800
Yes, thank you!

40:16.800 --> 40:17.960
Wait.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.600
(WHIR)

40:43.720 --> 40:45.640
Abandoned no longer.

40:48.200 --> 40:51.880
Ascension is near!

40:53.920 --> 40:55.920
No wonder
they almost wiped us out.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.280
The systems on this ship

40:57.320 --> 40:59.520
are the most advanced
I've ever seen.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.800
Have you seen
the speed we're going at?

41:01.840 --> 41:04.280
It'd barely take us any time
to get to Ko Sharmus.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.800
Yeah, bringing
hundreds of thousands

41:05.840 --> 41:07.000
of dormant Cybermen with us.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.240
We can't do that.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.800
We cannot take Cybermen
to the Boundary.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.000
What are our other options?

41:15.280 --> 41:16.800
Surrender this ship?

41:16.840 --> 41:19.360
Land on another planet and
set the Cybermen loose there?

41:20.360 --> 41:22.360
We're gonna
keep all of you safe.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.920
We're gonna find the Doctor

41:23.960 --> 41:25.760
and we're gonna
take them Cybermen down.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.280
Aren't we, Graham?

41:30.160 --> 41:31.560
Yes, we are, Yaz.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.240
Totally. Very much so.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.360
That's some
high-level self-delusion.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.160
None of us are giving up, eh?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.320
Not now.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.680
Glass half-full, right?

41:43.360 --> 41:45.320
What do you think
they're doing down there?

41:45.360 --> 41:47.880
Let me activate the ob system.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.840
GRAHAM: They've opened up
those containers.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.840
Awaken, my soldiers.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.960
The ascension shall begin.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.920
(ROBOTIC SHRIEKING)

42:23.920 --> 42:26.600
(SHRIEKING INTENSIFIES)

42:32.600 --> 42:35.120
We're carrying a Cyberman

42:35.160 --> 42:38.640
that makes
other Cybermen scream.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.080
RYAN:
So where's this Boundary?

42:41.120 --> 42:42.840
Cos that's just the sea.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.080
This is where it starts,
every time.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.320
I've seen people go through.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.760
And I hope they're alive
and well elsewhere.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.160
That's quite a risk
everyone's taking.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.080
A leap into the unknown.

42:56.120 --> 42:59.520
It was preferable
to the alternative.

43:01.560 --> 43:04.440
If you want to see it,
step closer.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.280
It responds to proximity.

43:10.680 --> 43:11.880
A bit further...

43:11.920 --> 43:14.440
...and it will respond.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.320
(RUMBLING)

43:22.680 --> 43:24.320
Here it comes.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.560
How is that possible?

43:29.600 --> 43:33.000
I don't know, but it's good,
isn't it?

43:36.360 --> 43:39.200
KO SHARMUS: It's the last
way out of this galaxy.

43:41.760 --> 43:44.720
SERGEANT:
It's a sad day for us all here.

43:44.760 --> 43:45.800
But if any man can be said

43:45.840 --> 43:47.600
to have earned
a peaceful retirement,

43:47.640 --> 43:49.640
it's our Brendan.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.120
On behalf
of the local community

43:52.160 --> 43:54.640
and everyone past and present
who you've helped,

43:54.680 --> 43:56.600
we'd like to present you
with this memento.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.640
May we all live up
to the standards you've set us.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.760
#- Thank you, Brendan.
- Thank you, sir.

44:07.680 --> 44:10.080
(FOOTSTEPS)

44:15.320 --> 44:16.800
(TICKING)

44:26.040 --> 44:27.600
Hello, Brendan.

44:27.640 --> 44:30.360
Would you mind coming with us
to the back office?

44:49.080 --> 44:51.280
(CLOCK TICKS)

45:09.280 --> 45:12.360
We have to get rid of
everything, I'm afraid.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.480
Thank you for your service.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.880
We're sorry
you won't remember it.

45:21.040 --> 45:23.480
(SCREAMS)

45:31.720 --> 45:33.280
We're coming out of vortex.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.920
We're not far away.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.960
Close enough to send a signal,
warn 'em we're coming.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.320
I can help you do that.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.840
Guys, they're all waking up
down there.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.760
We know you're here.

46:30.160 --> 46:32.040
My warriors are coming for you.

46:50.040 --> 46:53.720
Yaz looking for The Doctor,
all frequencies.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.480
Yaz looking for The Doctor.

46:57.680 --> 47:00.080
Yaz, we can hear you.
Can you hear me?

47:02.920 --> 47:04.160
YAZ: Doctor!

47:04.200 --> 47:05.520
Where are you?

47:05.560 --> 47:07.880
We're on a Cyber battle
cruiser with that Cyber guy

47:07.920 --> 47:09.600
and a lot of Cyber troops
that are waking up.

47:13.680 --> 47:14.800
They're coming!

47:18.040 --> 47:20.440
They're right outside the door!

47:20.480 --> 47:22.760
Yaz, get off that ship - now.

47:22.800 --> 47:24.640
- We can't!
- (BANGING ON DOOR)

47:24.680 --> 47:26.760
We're trapped,
and they're about to break in.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.520
(BANGING CONTINUES)

47:31.080 --> 47:32.880
Yaz...

47:32.920 --> 47:34.720
Yaz!

47:34.760 --> 47:36.960
(RUMBLING)

47:41.840 --> 47:43.360
ETHAN: What is that?

47:44.520 --> 47:46.760
That's not possible.

47:46.800 --> 47:49.040
I've never seen it
look like that before.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.880
That's my home planet.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.760
That's Gallifrey.

48:04.800 --> 48:07.520
How is Gallifrey here?

48:09.760 --> 48:11.840
Wow! Ahh!

48:11.880 --> 48:15.200
Ah!
That's a good entrance, right?

48:17.480 --> 48:19.360
Be afraid, Doctor.

48:21.160 --> 48:24.480
Because everything
is about to change...

48:24.520 --> 48:25.800
...forever.

48:57.200 --> 49:00.080
THE MASTER: Look upon my work,
Doctor, and despair.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.560
We don't stand a chance here.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.080
We are stuck on a ship
stacked with Cybermen.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.320
THE MASTER: I told you before

49:09.360 --> 49:11.080
that everything you knew
was a lie.

49:11.120 --> 49:13.240
Well, now you get to
face the truth.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.960
KO SHARMUS:
You can be a pacifist tomorrow.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.320
Today, you have to survive.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.720
Set course for Gallifrey.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.040
Brace yourself.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.000
This is going to hurt.
