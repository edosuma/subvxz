08:06.256 --> 08:07.658
I SAILED HERE FROM MEXICO
BY MYSELF.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.119
I DON'T NEED YOU TO WAIT
FOR MY PARENTS.

08:09.119 --> 08:10.490
TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.692
(lowered voice)
I'M NOT GETTING A PULSE.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.023
(normal voice) OKAY, EMERY,
I AM SO SORRY,

08:13.023 --> 08:15.666
BUT WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO SAVE YOUR FOOT, OKAY?

08:15.666 --> 08:17.027
NO!

08:17.027 --> 08:18.529
YOUR INJURY'S VERY SEVERE.

08:18.529 --> 08:20.130
IT'S MANGLED AND THERE'S
NO BLOOD FLOW.
AAH! AAH!

08:20.130 --> 08:21.501
GIVE HER 5 OF MORPHINE!

08:21.501 --> 08:23.033
(Jo) OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.204
(pants)

08:24.204 --> 08:27.207
(Emery crying)

08:42.693 --> 08:43.994
SHE MOVED HER TOES
WITH A NEARLY SEVERED FOOT

08:43.994 --> 08:46.627
SO THE TIBIAL NERVE'S PROBABLY
STILL INTACT, RIGHT?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.559
SO, DR. TORRES, YOU THINK
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SAVE THE FOOT?

08:48.559 --> 08:50.260
WELL, WHEN WE GET IN THERE
AND DO SOME NERVE TESTING,

08:50.260 --> 08:52.262
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ASSESS
THE DAMAGE BETTER.

08:52.262 --> 08:54.164
I SPOKE TO HER PARENTS. THEIR
FLIGHT GETS IN LATE TONIGHT.

08:54.164 --> 08:55.706
GREAT.
DO YOU WANT TO SCRUB IN?

08:55.706 --> 08:57.037
HELL, YEAH. (chuckles)

08:57.037 --> 08:58.238
ALL RIGHT.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.670

08:59.670 --> 09:01.011

09:01.011 --> 09:02.012

I NEED YOU TO STAY BEHIND

09:02.012 --> 09:03.574
AND MONITOR
MY PRE- AND POST-OPS.
BUT, UM...

09:03.574 --> 09:04.915
I HAD HOPED--SINCE I WAS
THE ONE THAT SAW THE TOES MOVE,

09:04.915 --> 09:06.617
I'D HOPED THAT I--

09:06.617 --> 09:08.949
BUT YOU NEED ME TO MONITOR
YOUR PRE- AND POST-OPS.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.121

09:11.121 --> 09:12.282
(sighs)

09:12.282 --> 09:13.654
YOU COULD'VE LET HER SCRUB IN

09:13.654 --> 09:14.825
OR STAND IN THE BACK
AND OBSERVE.

09:14.825 --> 09:15.986
WHY?

09:15.986 --> 09:16.957
BECAUSE SHE HAS JOY.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.989
I LIKE JOY,
EXCITEMENT, HAPPINESS,

09:18.989 --> 09:20.691
PEOPLE LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I KNOW THINGS.

09:20.691 --> 09:22.733
SHE PRACTICALLY SQUEALED
WHEN I MENTIONED NERVE TESTING.

09:22.733 --> 09:23.934
THERE NEEDS TO BE
MORE SQUEALING.

09:23.934 --> 09:25.265
I CAN SQUEAL
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.967
THAT SOUNDS DIRTY
AND INAPPROPRIATE.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.639
OH, WHICH I HEAR IS
YOUR SPECIALTY THESE DAYS.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.601

09:32.643 --> 09:35.005

A TATER TOT HOT DISH.

09:35.005 --> 09:36.807

09:36.807 --> 09:39.279
RINA ALSO BROUGHT
TATER TOT HOT DISH.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.981

IT'S POP POP'S FAVORITE.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.983
(woman) OH, I KNOW IT IS, LOVE.
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.285
OKAY, YOU KNOW POP POP
HAS AN ENLARGED HEART.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.917
SO HE CAN'T BE HAVING

09:46.917 --> 09:49.019
A TATER TOT HOT DISH.

09:49.019 --> 09:50.220
NOT EVEN A BITE?
OHH.

09:50.220 --> 09:51.662
(boy) IT'S HIS LAST MEAL.

09:51.662 --> 09:54.224
NO, YOU GET A LAST MEAL
BEFORE THEY KILL YOU.

09:54.224 --> 09:56.026

ON DOING THAT.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.299
(both) OH, HI, DR. THOMAS.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.901
(woman speaking indistinctly

10:00.901 --> 10:03.373
NEVER SHOW UP IN MR. PATEL'S
ROOM DURING VISITING HOURS.

10:03.373 --> 10:05.035

10:06.837 --> 10:08.979

PLANNING ON DOING

10:08.979 --> 10:10.140
THE VENTRICULAR REDUCTION
SURGERY?

10:10.140 --> 10:11.942
YES, I SPOKE TO HIM
ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.

10:13.343 --> 10:15.315
WOULDN'T AN L-VAD
BE IN ORDER?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.017
AN L-VAD IS A BAND-AID.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.150
VENTRICULAR REDUCTION
IS A REPAIR.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.392
YOU'LL BE HACKING OFF
WORKING HEART MUSCLE.

10:22.392 --> 10:24.394
SO THAT WHAT'S LEFT
CAN WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY.

10:24.394 --> 10:25.926
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY
HIGH-RISK PROCEDURE

10:25.926 --> 10:27.057
WHEN THERE'S A SIMPLE FIX.

10:27.057 --> 10:29.960
PEOPLE DIE
FROM THIS SURGERY.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.732
NOT WHEN I DO IT,
THEY DON'T.

10:38.068 --> 10:42.342
HOW DOES SUCH A TINY HUMAN
MAKE SUCH A BIG MESS?

10:42.342 --> 10:45.075
(sighs) SHOULD WE SETTLE?

10:45.075 --> 10:46.246
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.118
WE COULD STOP WORK,
TRAVEL FOR A WHILE,

10:48.118 --> 10:49.279
SHOW ZOLA THE WORLD.

10:49.279 --> 10:51.021

ZOLA WANTS TO SEE THE PARK

10:51.021 --> 10:53.153
AND THE POND AND THE TURTLE
THAT LIVES IN THE POND.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.424
OKAY, SO WE DON'T SETTLE.

10:54.424 --> 10:56.957
NOT SETTLING MEANS WHAT,
YEARS OF LITIGATION

10:56.957 --> 10:59.129
AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS?

10:59.129 --> 11:03.063
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BRING MARK
OR LEXIE BACK.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.364
TRAVELING THE WORLD
SOUNDS BETTER.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.966

ZOLA'S SLEEPING...

11:11.301 --> 11:13.003

11:13.003 --> 11:14.244
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:14.244 --> 11:16.176

ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

GOOD VISIBILITY FOR THE HERNIA.

12:04.254 --> 12:05.996
I'M REVIRGINIZING.

12:05.996 --> 12:08.859

IT'S A THING,

12:08.859 --> 12:10.030
REVIRGINIZING.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.201
IT INVOLVES A LOT OF PRAYER,

12:11.201 --> 12:12.502
WHICH I HAD TIME TO DO
IN MOLINE,

12:12.502 --> 12:14.334
STARING AT THE 'N SYNC POSTERS
ON MY WALL,

12:14.334 --> 12:17.337
WHICH KIND OF MAKES ME THINK
OF JESUS AS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE,

12:17.337 --> 12:19.039
BUT MY PASTOR SAYS
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE,

12:19.039 --> 12:20.340

AS I'M STILL TALKING TO HIM,

12:20.340 --> 12:22.012

12:25.275 --> 12:27.147

I'D GET ONE,

12:27.147 --> 12:30.080

SHOWED UP IN MOLINE

12:30.080 --> 12:31.782
AND OFFERED MY JOB BACK,

12:31.782 --> 12:33.083

12:33.083 --> 12:36.086
THAT I GET TO
RECOMMIT MYSELF TO GOD.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.358

HIS FORGIVENESS

16:09.299 --> 16:11.201
Oh... (sighs)
I don't know.

APPARENTLY, SO AM I.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.149

TO RESTORE BLOOD FLOW

16:19.149 --> 16:21.011

BE ABLE TO SAVE IT.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.615

16:34.394 --> 16:36.396

WHAT DR. TORRES HAS TO SAY.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.268
NO, IF I GET BACK OUT THERE
WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS,

16:38.268 --> 16:40.630
I CAN STILL MAKE IT BEFORE
THE WEATHER GETS REALLY BAD.

16:40.630 --> 16:42.102
OH, I COULD JUST AMPUTATE
YOUR FOOT,

16:42.102 --> 16:43.633

UP AND OUT OF HERE IN A WEEK.

16:43.633 --> 16:46.676
OR I COULD GET YOU CLOSE
TO FULL FUNCTION BACK,

16:46.676 --> 16:49.139

OF PRETTY BIG OPERATIONS

16:49.139 --> 16:50.610
OVER A FEW MONTHS,

16:50.610 --> 16:54.244

16:55.745 --> 16:57.387
FINE. LET'S DO IT.

I DON'T GO HOME
TO FAMILY

24:23.533 --> 24:25.194
AND, UH, CHITCHAT.

24:25.194 --> 24:26.896
I GO TO BED

24:26.896 --> 24:29.599
THINKING ABOUT THIS TECHNIQUE.

24:29.599 --> 24:31.601
SO...

24:31.601 --> 24:34.944
WHAT IS YOUR SIGNATURE MOVE,
HMM?

24:34.944 --> 24:36.746
OH, I-I DON'T--

24:36.746 --> 24:38.247
LIFE IS SHORT, YOU KNOW?

24:38.247 --> 24:40.680
YOU'VE SEEN THAT YOURSELF.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.912
SO YOU BETTER GET AT IT.

24:42.912 --> 24:45.114
THERE IT IS.

24:45.114 --> 24:48.918
NOW IF YOU HAD PUT IN
YOUR BELOVED L-VAD,

24:48.918 --> 24:51.921
HE WOULD'VE DIED
WAITING FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT,

24:51.921 --> 24:53.492
WHICH WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.268

24:59.268 --> 25:01.531
UH, NOTHING, SIR.

25:01.531 --> 25:04.874
(suction gurgling)

25:10.610 --> 25:13.512
THE SETTLEMENT MEETING
IS AT 8:00 TOMORROW NIGHT.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.785
ARE YOU GONNA GO?

25:15.785 --> 25:17.647
MM.

25:17.647 --> 25:20.019
YOU'RE GOING,
SO I DON'T HAVE TO.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.592
SEE HOW THAT WORKS?

25:22.592 --> 25:26.726
I'M GOING TO SPEAK FOR MARK,
WHO CAN'T SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.799
SEE HOW THAT WORKS?
(chuckles)

25:29.799 --> 25:31.530
YOU SHOULD BE AT THAT MEETING.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.703
YOU SHOULD SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
I-I WASN'T THERE.

25:33.703 --> 25:36.966
I--IT'S NOT A DECISION
I SHOULD BE MAKING FOR YOU.

25:40.209 --> 25:42.772
YOU WEREN'T SHY ABOUT MAKING
OTHER DECISIONS FOR ME.

25:42.772 --> 25:44.113
WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW?

25:44.113 --> 25:46.015
I MEAN,
I THINK YOU'RE ON A ROLL.

25:46.015 --> 25:47.577
I CAN'T DO THIS.

25:47.577 --> 25:49.679
SAY IT,
'CAUSE IT WAS PERFECT.

25:49.679 --> 25:51.751
"IT'S NOT A DECISION THAT
I SHOULD BE MAKING FOR YOU."

25:51.751 --> 25:52.922
SAY IT.

25:52.922 --> 25:54.083
STOP.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.785
SAY IT AGAIN.

25:55.785 --> 25:57.857
"IT'S NOT A DECISION
THAT I SHOULD BE MAKING FOR YOU!

25:57.857 --> 25:59.228
"AS OPPOSED TO
HACKING OFF A LIMB--

25:59.228 --> 26:00.890
THAT'S THE KIND OF DECISION
I SHOULD MAKE FOR YOU."

26:00.890 --> 26:03.593
FINE. DON'T GO.
I WILL MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS.
(Sofia crying)

26:03.593 --> 26:04.764
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

26:04.764 --> 26:06.265
I'M GONNA VOTE TO TAKE
THE SETTLEMENT FOR SOFIA,

26:06.265 --> 26:08.698
BECAUSE MARK WOULD WANT HER
TO HAVE THE MONEY.

26:08.698 --> 26:09.839
I THINK MARK WOULD WANT YOU

26:09.839 --> 26:11.841
TO PICK UP YOUR DAUGHTER
WHEN SHE'S CRYING.

26:11.841 --> 26:12.972
I GUESS HE'S GONNA HAVE TO
DEAL WITH DISAPPOINTMENT,

26:12.972 --> 26:14.243

this heart, and it was amazing.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.767
I mean, you should see how
this guy handles myocardium.

26:37.767 --> 26:38.998
ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HIM?

26:38.998 --> 26:40.670

NO WAY. KEPNER DID IT?

26:44.303 --> 26:45.675
She did it.

26:45.675 --> 26:46.636
FINALLY.

26:46.636 --> 26:48.137
Except she's not
doing it again.

26:48.137 --> 26:49.308
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:49.308 --> 26:50.910
CLEAN SLATE.
SHE'S REVIRGINIZING.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.081
Oh, please.

26:52.081 --> 26:53.913
NO, SHE'S THERE, HE'S THERE.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.645
ALL SHE HAS TO DO
IS HEAR HIS VOICE,

26:55.645 --> 26:57.346
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO THINK STRAIGHT.

26:57.346 --> 26:59.218

NOW KEEP IN MIND,

26:59.218 --> 27:01.821

34:03.672 --> 34:05.074
HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK BACK.

34:05.074 --> 34:06.715
HE WALKED IN,
SAW A TOY HE LIKED,

34:06.715 --> 34:08.217
AND DIDN'T LOOK BACK.

34:08.217 --> 34:10.449
(scoffs)
I CALLED HIS DAD.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.781
HE WAS... BUSY.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.454
(sighs)

34:15.454 --> 34:16.785
HE'S GETTING MARRIED AGAIN.

34:19.088 --> 34:20.389
AND SHE'S VERY NICE.

34:20.389 --> 34:24.233
I-I LIKE HER.
WHATEVER. HE WAS BUSY.

34:24.233 --> 34:25.734
SO I CALLED BEN,

34:25.734 --> 34:28.567
AND HE WAS STUDYING UP

34:28.567 --> 34:32.141
TO OBSERVE HIS FIRST
LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY.

34:32.141 --> 34:33.742
HE WAS SO EXCITED--

34:33.742 --> 34:35.244
EVERYBODY'S MOVING ON.

34:35.244 --> 34:37.246
AND I'M HERE,
DOING APPYS AND CHOLES,

34:37.246 --> 34:40.078
'CAUSE WHAT A GENERAL SURGERY

34:40.078 --> 34:41.550

34:45.314 --> 34:47.586
I'M STUCK.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.819
AND I DIDN'T CARE. YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, THIS WAS MY CHOICE.

34:50.819 --> 34:53.262

34:53.262 --> 34:54.793

34:54.793 --> 34:58.227

35:02.631 --> 35:05.734

35:05.734 --> 35:07.176

35:07.176 --> 35:08.537

35:11.680 --> 35:13.742

35:13.742 --> 35:15.844

35:15.844 --> 35:18.847

35:18.847 --> 35:21.450

35:21.450 --> 35:24.293
THEY ALL STILL LOVE YOU.

35:24.293 --> 35:27.496
BUT IT MEANS
YOU GET YOUR HAND BACK.

35:27.496 --> 35:29.898
IT MEANS YOU HAVE TIME--

35:29.898 --> 35:31.630

35:56.525 --> 35:57.686

35:57.686 --> 35:59.358
NO, I DON'T CARE.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.632
