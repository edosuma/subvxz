<i>It all started when a time
travel experiment I was conducting... </i>

fun if I knew how to fly. </i>

00:18.303 --> 00:21.568

00:21.639 --> 00:25.666

all he can lend is moral support. </i>

<i>The trouble with quantum
leaping is that just about the time... </i>

01:59.704 --> 02:02.229
<i>I start to enjoy being a hero,</i>

02:32.937 --> 02:35.371
- Where, Where was I?
- You were explaining...

02:35.440 --> 02:37.806
Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine.

02:38.943 --> 02:41.878
Right. Right, right.

02:41.946 --> 02:46.940
Heathcliff's obsession, uh, with Catherine...

02:47.018 --> 02:50.146
in, uh, uh,

02:51.356 --> 02:53.756
Oh. Wuthering Heights, of course.

02:53.825 --> 02:57.454
Dr. Bryant, do you
think Heathcliff's obsession...

02:57.529 --> 03:02.432
stems from Brontes own tragic
yearning for Bramwell?

03:03.635 --> 03:07.765
I think the woman was
sexually suppressed. Far out, man.

03:07.839 --> 03:11.741
You think she wrote this because
she was horny? Right on!

03:14.312 --> 03:17.247
Great. Four of my least favorite clichés.

03:17.315 --> 03:20.546
Headbands, bell bottoms, flower
power and English Lit.

03:20.618 --> 03:23.451
What do you think, Dr. Bryant?

03:24.989 --> 03:28.152
Uh, well, I-I,

03:30.662 --> 03:34.428
It's an interesting and,
and a difficult question.

03:36.668 --> 03:39.569
Uh, and one we'll have
to discuss tomorrow. No way.

03:39.637 --> 03:41.798
No Friday classes in summer school.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.137
Right? Oh, yes. Uh,

04:19.877 --> 04:22.345
Dr. Bryant.! Dr. Bryant.!

04:22.413 --> 04:26.941
Oh. I've been trying to get a moment
alone with you all afternoon.

04:27.018 --> 04:30.419
Uh, uh, Jamie-Lee, um,

04:30.488 --> 04:32.752
W
- what can I do for you?

04:32.824 --> 04:35.520
"Give me life, my darling.

04:37.328 --> 04:40.991
Touch my hand and light my soul. "

04:43.668 --> 04:45.932
- Keats?
- No.

04:46.004 --> 04:48.666
Your lecture on expressing love.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.177
My, I wanna go home.

04:53.244 --> 04:55.474
You live this way.

04:56.781 --> 04:59.113
Jamie-Lee, um,

04:59.183 --> 05:04.553
I'm a teacher and you're a
student, so no fraternizing.

05:04.622 --> 05:07.887
That's not what you said last night.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.052
I didn't? No.

05:14.465 --> 05:16.228
Donna.

05:18.302 --> 05:20.964
Of course. This is Lawrence.!

05:23.608 --> 05:25.599
Where are you going? After,

05:27.145 --> 05:29.079
To the Rathskeller.

05:29.147 --> 05:31.877
They're closed between 4.00
and 6.00 in the summer.

05:31.949 --> 05:36.181
She's going in. Donna Eleese works there.

05:38.156 --> 05:43.685
Jerry, we have to talk. It's
a matter of life and death.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.695
I'll put the tea on. Jamie-Lee,

05:45.763 --> 05:48.493
I don't think it's a good
idea for you to be in my rooms.

05:53.004 --> 05:56.531
What's wrong? Everything.

05:56.607 --> 06:00.099
Oh, don't say that.

06:00.178 --> 06:02.578
I know there's a solution.

06:02.647 --> 06:07.778
I believe our love will conquer all, even Daddy.

06:09.253 --> 06:11.744
You gotta be kidding!

06:11.823 --> 06:14.656
No, I'm not.

06:16.527 --> 06:18.791
I did it.

06:18.863 --> 06:21.559
I told Daddy everything.

06:21.632 --> 06:25.568
From that first blush of love...

06:25.636 --> 06:29.037
to that glorious night in the bell tower.

06:31.309 --> 06:36.144
Daddy was furious and threatened to have you
horsewhipped within an inch of your life.

06:36.214 --> 06:38.910
Oscar said he'd kill you with his bare hands.

06:38.983 --> 06:43.579
- Oscar?
- A Neanderthal who goes to Ohio State.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.715
He wants to pin me.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.119
Oh, Jerry!

06:51.195 --> 06:53.254
Precious!

07:06.911 --> 07:10.779
It's all so like Romeo and Juliet.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.873
Great. Men wanna horsewhip and kill me,

07:12.950 --> 07:15.043
and you're playing Juliet.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.988
Juliet committed suicide. Suicide?

07:20.057 --> 07:23.618
Oh, yes!

07:23.694 --> 07:26.527
Of course!

07:26.597 --> 07:28.531
A love pact!

07:28.599 --> 07:30.965
Sam, we don't want that to happen, do we?

07:31.035 --> 07:35.233
No. Uh, Jamie-Lee,

07:35.306 --> 07:37.900
we are not committing suicide.

07:37.975 --> 07:40.569
What else is there to do?

07:44.916 --> 07:46.907
Have a cup of tea.

07:50.321 --> 07:53.484
Precisely what Jane and Edward would have done.

07:56.994 --> 07:59.326
Jane and Edward?

07:59.397 --> 08:02.662
Oh, uh, Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.429
Charlotte Brontes star-crossed lovers.

08:06.871 --> 08:09.635
How can you teach English literature
if you don't know that?

08:10.942 --> 08:14.036
But, anyway, we're gonna get
you out of this one quick this time.

08:14.111 --> 08:17.205
Ziggy figures a 99.5% chance
- I don't want out of this one quick.

08:17.281 --> 08:19.215
you'll be able to leap when, What?

08:19.283 --> 08:22.548
Hark, my sweetie pie.

08:22.620 --> 08:25.054
Jamie-Lee, I want you to take this cup of tea...

08:25.122 --> 08:27.056
and go straight back to your dorm.

08:27.124 --> 08:29.058
You call your father and Oswald
- Oscar.

08:29.126 --> 08:31.060
Whatever. Tell them it was all a joke.

08:31.128 --> 08:34.222
You made it up because you missed them
and wanted to get their attention.

08:34.298 --> 08:36.732
But it's not a joke.

08:36.801 --> 08:39.565
Ohhh. Oh, yes, it is.

08:40.638 --> 08:42.731
It's the school, isn't it?

08:42.807 --> 08:45.241
You're afraid of losing your tenure.

08:45.309 --> 08:47.243
I'm afraid of losing my life.

08:47.311 --> 08:51.247
If it comes to that, so be it.

08:51.315 --> 08:56.082
Our love can live without these temporal bodies.

08:57.088 --> 09:00.922
Uh, Romeo and Juliet?

09:00.992 --> 09:03.688
Lancelot and Guinevere.

09:05.096 --> 09:09.533
Uh, Jamie-Lee, we, uh, w-we
can play Lancelot and Guinevere...

09:09.600 --> 09:11.534
some other time.

09:11.602 --> 09:14.696
When, my darling?

09:14.772 --> 09:19.709
When, uh, the-the moon...

09:19.777 --> 09:22.211
has crested over the...

09:22.280 --> 09:25.044
towers of Camelot.

09:32.290 --> 09:37.557
"When the moon has crested
over the towers of Camelot?"

09:37.628 --> 09:40.392
I know. It's... You better watch it, Sam.

09:40.464 --> 09:43.558
You're gonna end up marrying her too.

09:43.634 --> 09:47.297
They got married? June 20th, 1972.

09:47.371 --> 09:51.569
Nice little intimate shotgun
wedding, 12-gauge, I think it was.

09:51.642 --> 09:53.576
That's what you're here for...

09:53.644 --> 09:56.579
is to see that those two don't
ruin both their lives.

09:56.647 --> 09:59.411
Of course, there's not much more that
could go wrong with Professor Bryant's.

09:59.483 --> 10:02.919
That's not why I'm here. Oh?

10:02.987 --> 10:05.080
I'm here to get a second chance,

10:05.156 --> 10:08.250
before I even get a first one.

10:08.326 --> 10:10.988
You wanna let me in on the joke?

10:12.330 --> 10:14.491
Donna Eleese is here.

10:15.499 --> 10:18.400
That's not funny, Sam. But true.

10:18.469 --> 10:21.597
Don't you see, Al? I'm here to
get Donna and I a second chance.

10:21.672 --> 10:24.038
You're here to see that Guinevere there...

10:24.108 --> 10:26.042
doesn't make the biggest mistake of her life!

10:26.110 --> 10:27.038
How do you know that?

10:27.039 --> 10:29.204
Ziggy's got it computed down
to the decimal point!

10:29.280 --> 10:31.612
I don't give a damn what a computer says!

10:31.682 --> 10:33.775
We're talking about the
woman I love and my future.

10:33.851 --> 10:37.617
I'm here. She's here. We've got a second chance.

10:38.856 --> 10:41.654
And no one's gonna stop me from taking it.

10:41.726 --> 10:43.853
Not even you.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.643
Sam, you're breaking your own inside trader rule.

10:52.644 --> 10:53.196
What?

10:53.270 --> 10:55.465
Quantum leap rule numero uno.

10:55.539 --> 10:59.134
The time traveler shall not take
advantage of his position...

10:59.210 --> 11:01.303
to improve or alter his life.

11:01.379 --> 11:03.313
- I made that rule?
- Yes.

11:03.381 --> 11:07.750
And you swore everyone to a blood oath
of allegiance to it on penalty of death.

11:07.818 --> 11:11.219
- Ah, that's my interpretation.
- If I made the rule, I can rescind it.

11:11.288 --> 11:11.892
So ordered.

11:11.893 --> 11:15.349
Not without committee approval,
and Weitzman will never give it.

11:15.426 --> 11:18.987
Weitzman? Short fat guy, uh, in knickers? Mm.

11:19.063 --> 11:21.554
Tall skinny guy with a stovepipe hat.

11:21.632 --> 11:24.931
He's got at Lincoln fixation
and he also controls the committee,

11:25.002 --> 11:28.165
and he wants you declared non compos mentis.

11:28.239 --> 11:31.106
Let him. In case you haven't noticed, Al,

11:31.175 --> 11:34.667
the committee doesn't run
this project or me anymore.

11:57.368 --> 12:00.201
Pretty straight for the '70s.

12:00.271 --> 12:03.069
Of course, this is a Catholic girls' college,

12:04.475 --> 12:07.137
- Look at you.
- Uh, it's psychedelic.

12:07.211 --> 12:09.145
It must be the black light or something.

12:09.213 --> 12:11.647
You look like a ghost.

12:12.650 --> 12:15.619
Look. There she is. There's Donna.

12:15.686 --> 12:17.950
Oh, my God. It is her.

12:18.022 --> 12:20.422
Now do you believe me? Donna's here. I'm here.

12:20.491 --> 12:23.255
Fate has put us together again.

12:23.327 --> 12:26.592
When I saw her today, I
couldn't believe it. She's so young.

12:26.664 --> 12:31.658
When we first met, she'd just left the
Star Bright Project and was turning 30.

12:31.735 --> 12:35.933
Don't do this, Sam. The
wedding was on the fifth of June...

12:36.006 --> 12:39.100
at Old Mission Chapel.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.337
It was hot and I was sweating,

12:41.412 --> 12:45.508
but, you know, it was more from nerves
than from the heat and then,

12:48.352 --> 12:50.684
Everybody went home, because...

12:54.492 --> 12:56.483
I didn't show up for the wedding.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.290
No. No, you showed up. She didn't.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.524
It had something to do with her father.

13:01.599 --> 13:03.692
He didn't die, did he? I wouldn't know.

13:03.767 --> 13:07.794
And if I did, I couldn't tell you. I
broke the rules before giving you personal data,

13:07.872 --> 13:11.137
and if I do it again, the committee's threatening
to remove me from the project.

13:11.208 --> 13:15.167
They can't remove you. You're
the only contact they have with me.

13:15.246 --> 13:17.305
Al, I want you to run a,

13:20.718 --> 13:22.743
Chicken.

13:35.799 --> 13:37.926
She smelled the same.

13:38.002 --> 13:40.266
Of course, I didn't.

13:40.337 --> 13:43.907
God, how I wanted to tell her I'm not
the boozed-out professor she sees,

13:43.908 --> 13:45.036
that I was her Sam,

13:45.109 --> 13:47.771
the man she'll love 10 years from now,

13:47.845 --> 13:49.779
that I'm doing what we dreamed of,

13:49.847 --> 13:51.815
I'm traveling in time.

13:51.882 --> 13:54.612
What can I get for you, Dr. Bryant?

13:54.685 --> 13:58.052
- Uh, an avion,
Evian. - A what?

13:58.122 --> 14:00.613
Uh, C-Coke. Uh, a Coke would be fine.

14:00.691 --> 14:03.216
A Coke, cheeseburger and
fries, medium rare on the burger,

14:03.294 --> 14:06.161
Hold the tomato, extra onion.

14:14.004 --> 14:18.168
She knew. She knew how I liked my burger.

14:18.242 --> 14:20.574
Shove that up your gauge circuit, Ziggy.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.412
Thank you. Uh, Donna,

14:26.483 --> 14:29.577
um, could I talk with you?

14:29.653 --> 14:31.746
Oh, I really don't have time, Dr. Bryant.

14:31.822 --> 14:34.052
Oh, yeah. I'll, um, uh,

14:34.124 --> 14:36.388
Maybe, Well, I'll just wait till you finish work.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.486
Dr, Bryant, please, um,

14:39.563 --> 14:41.758
I'm quite capable of
getting an "A" in your class...

14:41.832 --> 14:44.096
by simply doing the work.

14:44.168 --> 14:46.102
No. No. No, no.

14:46.170 --> 14:48.604
No, tha-that's, that's not what I'm saying.

14:48.672 --> 14:51.869
Donna, I'm not what I look like.

14:51.942 --> 14:54.342
If you look into my eyes, you can see that.

14:55.346 --> 14:58.941
- Is this your best line?
- It's not a line.

15:00.684 --> 15:06.088
If you look into my
eyes, you'll see another soul.

15:07.291 --> 15:10.954
- You've had too much to drink.
- I haven't had a drop.

15:23.807 --> 15:27.243
This is silly. Yeah. So it's silly.

15:30.314 --> 15:32.407
Do it anyway.

15:40.658 --> 15:45.595
Please don't talk to me anymore,
Dr. Bryant. Donna.

15:45.929 --> 15:47.920
Hey.! I thought I told
you to leave my girl alone.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.436
Donna's your girl? Jamie-Lee's my girl.

15:53.504 --> 15:55.438
Oscar.

15:55.506 --> 15:58.771
Yeah, Oscar, and he's here to break your face.

15:59.843 --> 16:05.213
Look, Oscar, why don't we
just talk about this man-to-man?

16:05.282 --> 16:09.218
If you don't like what you
hear, you can always break my face.

16:10.954 --> 16:14.720
Good. First, Jamie-Lee is crazy about you.

16:14.792 --> 16:18.888
Yeah, right. And that's why all she
can talk about is her precious Jerry.

16:18.962 --> 16:23.399
Which... Which proves my point. See, if
she was crazy about me, she'd never mention me.

16:23.467 --> 16:26.527
But since she's really crazy about
you, all she does is talk about me.

16:28.205 --> 16:31.971
She's trying to make you jealous.
Well, it's working.

16:32.042 --> 16:34.101
Oscar,

16:35.813 --> 16:38.247
Jamie-Lee once told me that...

16:38.315 --> 16:42.251
you were the only man who
ever made the earth move for her.

16:43.887 --> 16:45.878
Yeah? Yeah.

16:48.325 --> 16:50.850
That ain't what she told me.

16:50.928 --> 16:53.419
Isn't.

16:54.498 --> 16:57.467
Of course not. See, she's
frustrated with you. She,

16:58.736 --> 17:01.534
She thinks you want her only for her body.

17:01.605 --> 17:04.597
Oh, she's got a great body.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.869
She also has a mind, Oscar.

17:06.944 --> 17:10.710
Oscar. A deeply poetic mind.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.874
And if you want her to love you,

17:12.950 --> 17:17.215
you gotta let the romantic side of you free.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.119
Romantic side of me? I-Isn't
Jamie-Lee in your thoughts night and day?

17:20.190 --> 17:22.624
Yeah, except for wrestling practice.

17:24.294 --> 17:27.286
Well, tell her that, but don't mention
the wrestling practice stuff.

17:27.364 --> 17:32.358
Take to a romantic movie, a candlelit
dinner, read her a poem.

17:32.436 --> 17:35.564
I did. You did?

17:38.475 --> 17:40.409
There once was a young man from Kent...

17:40.477 --> 17:43.310
- Oscar, limericks aren't
exactly what I had in mind.

17:43.380 --> 17:45.075
Look, read her a romantic poet,

17:45.149 --> 17:47.413
Kelly, Sheets
- Keats. I don't know.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.248
What do you mean you don't know? You're the prof.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.311
I mean, the choice is yours.

17:52.389 --> 17:55.586
Tell her how beautiful she is,

17:55.659 --> 17:58.184
how her perfume drives you crazy,

17:58.262 --> 18:00.594
how you can't get her eyes out of your mind.

18:00.664 --> 18:04.964
And her lips. How
- How wet and how juicy they are.

18:05.035 --> 18:07.697
Perfect.

18:07.771 --> 18:12.401
That's mush. I can't talk
mush. To guys, it's mush.

18:12.476 --> 18:14.876
To women, it's romantic.

18:14.945 --> 18:17.778
Look, Oscar, Jamie-Lee
doesn't want a broken-down lit prof.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.715
She wants a young football hero
- Wrestling!

18:20.784 --> 18:25.278
Wrestling hero who'll be a little mushy.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.624
Dr. Bryant, I love Jamie-Lee so much...

18:30.694 --> 18:33.026
I'm willing to try anything.

18:34.097 --> 18:36.565
But I think you're feeding me a line of crap.

18:36.633 --> 18:41.536
And if this don't work, you can
expect me to be back to break your face.

18:53.317 --> 18:55.877
That might help.

19:00.657 --> 19:03.785
Where's Donna? She wasn't feeling
hot, so she went home.

19:03.861 --> 19:08.525
Did you want tomatoes on this? They didn't put
tomatoes on 'em, but I can get tomatoes for you.

19:08.599 --> 19:11.693
Did you want tomatoes? You know what else?
I was looking at the class schedule,

19:11.768 --> 19:16.535
Muskie has 156 delegates
pledged to him and many endorsements.

19:16.607 --> 19:19.405
Muskie met with McGovern today in Washington.

19:19.476 --> 19:23.207
If the party can stand on, it'll
be successful this fall.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.373
But we didn't talk about the
matter of endorsements.

19:25.449 --> 19:28.384
Would you like his support before you
go to the convention? I would love it.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.715
The United States Military Command in Saigon...

19:33.790 --> 19:37.317
said today that yesterday's air
attacks over North Vietnam were the heaviest,

19:38.629 --> 19:42.065
There was a time when I cared
about politics and the making of history,

19:42.132 --> 19:45.067
but the big picture seemed unimportant...

19:45.135 --> 19:47.729
next to getting a chance for
Donna and I in the future.

19:50.807 --> 19:53.742
Bryant had summed up my feelings with a thought.

19:53.810 --> 19:57.906
"Between love and the noblest
cause, there should be no contest.

19:58.982 --> 20:01.746
Love is life's only true satisfaction. "

20:01.818 --> 20:05.151
Yoo-hoo.! Lancelot.!

20:07.824 --> 20:11.419
The fires burn deep, my knight,

20:11.495 --> 20:14.760
as passion roars within me.

20:14.831 --> 20:19.598
Riddled with guilt, yet desperate for your loins,

20:19.670 --> 20:22.798
your Guinevere has arrived!

20:22.873 --> 20:24.272
Oh, boy.

20:24.341 --> 20:27.367
I get the feeling that you brought
this one on yourself.

20:27.444 --> 20:29.742
Where have you been? Waiting...

20:29.813 --> 20:33.408
for the moon to crest over Camelot.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.542
See what I mean?

20:35.619 --> 20:39.111
- You're not dressed.
- I wasn't expecting guests.

20:39.189 --> 20:43.057
But you promised to be Lancelot next.

20:43.126 --> 20:45.219
Next?

20:49.866 --> 20:52.994
Sam, there's all kinds of kinky stuff in here.!

20:53.070 --> 20:55.300
There's leather stuff. There's a Roman toga.

20:55.372 --> 20:58.307
There's rubber stuff in here.! Jamie-Lee,

20:58.375 --> 21:01.902
don't you have more
important things to do, like homework?

21:01.979 --> 21:05.471
I'm trying to work on my "A" in English Lit.

21:05.549 --> 21:09.246
Oh, my God.! Sam, you gotta see this.!

21:09.319 --> 21:12.083
Jamie-Lee, you gotta forget about me.

21:12.155 --> 21:15.249
You gotta start thinking
about other men, like, like Oscar.

21:15.325 --> 21:19.261
He's just a boy. That
boy wanted to break my face.

21:19.329 --> 21:22.924
He wanted to defend my honor?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.264
Uh, define "honor"?

21:25.335 --> 21:27.599
Oscar's willing to kill for you.

21:27.671 --> 21:30.606
Don't you think you should
at least give him a chance?

21:30.674 --> 21:33.006
But he's so stiff,

21:34.845 --> 21:36.836
so unromantic.

21:37.848 --> 21:42.285
Not anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if Oscar
started reading you romantic poetry.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.513
Oscar? Oscar.

21:46.757 --> 21:51.785
Look, believe me,
Jamie-Lee. He's the one for you,

21:51.862 --> 21:53.796
not me.

21:53.864 --> 21:58.801
Ah. You're both young. You got
your whole life in front of you.

21:58.869 --> 22:02.236
Uh, tell her they're both gonna
grow up to be yuppies. Give him a chance.

22:02.305 --> 22:05.741
They're gonna eat pasta and
drive B.M.W's with, uh, fuzzy seats.

22:05.809 --> 22:09.404
Well, if you think I should,

22:12.482 --> 22:14.643
Al, Donna,

22:14.718 --> 22:17.812
But it won't affect my love for you!

22:20.657 --> 22:22.682
Peace.

22:26.930 --> 22:30.422
Al, Donna knew how I wanted my cheeseburger.

22:31.835 --> 22:35.669
What? She looked into my eyes,
and she knew it was me.

22:36.673 --> 22:41.440
Well, how could she know it was you when
she doesn't meet you for 12 years?

22:41.511 --> 22:44.605
We're star-crossed souls. That uncrossed.

22:44.681 --> 22:48.117
Well, you know, I've been working
on that, and I think I can fix it.

22:48.185 --> 22:51.120
But I have to locate her father, and I was
- No.

22:51.188 --> 22:55.352
Al. Al, couldn't you
- No. No, no. No! No! I can't help you, Sam.

22:55.425 --> 22:58.451
If I even try, they're gonna pull
the plug, and they're not kidding.

22:58.528 --> 23:00.462
Weitzman is at the foundation right now...

23:00.530 --> 23:02.395
arguing for the authority to do it.

23:02.466 --> 23:05.799
You've broken your rules. You've
broken their rules. You've broken our rules.

23:05.869 --> 23:09.236
You gotta stop thinking with your
heart and start thinking with your noggin.

23:09.306 --> 23:11.240
Is that what you'd do?

23:11.308 --> 23:15.244
If, Hey. If some woman stood me up
at the altar, it's 'Adios, amigos. "

23:16.313 --> 23:19.407
Actually, uh, I wish a couple of them had.

23:24.321 --> 23:27.256
Don't give me that sick puppy look.

23:29.059 --> 23:32.085
Stop it. I'll never scratch
you behind the ears again.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.153
Now, stop it.

23:35.499 --> 23:38.593
Donna's father was career military. Shh. No. Sam,

23:38.668 --> 23:42.263
Uh, he was in the army, I think. Sam. Sa... No.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.997
No.

24:00.524 --> 24:03.721
Bunsen burners, there's no other smell like it.

24:03.794 --> 24:07.730
They are the common denominator
that make all science departments equal.

24:07.798 --> 24:11.564
My life's blood, and I'm
trapped in Mr. English Lit.

24:11.635 --> 24:13.626
There's no justice.

24:43.433 --> 24:44.208
Thanks.

24:44.209 --> 24:47.460
You forgot Hubble's
Constant and, uh, the red shift.

24:47.537 --> 24:49.801
Right.

24:49.873 --> 24:53.604
Your calculations are in the right direction.
You're just not applying your astrophysics.

24:55.045 --> 24:56.979
Expanding universe.

24:57.047 --> 25:00.016
Ever read Lemaitre's "Primeval Atom?"

25:00.083 --> 25:02.142
No.

25:02.219 --> 25:05.848
"Then came the explosion, followed by
the filling of the heavens with smoke.

25:07.123 --> 25:09.557
"We come to late to do no more than...

25:09.626 --> 25:12.322
visualize the splendor of creation's birthday. "

25:12.395 --> 25:14.329
It's beautiful.

25:14.397 --> 25:16.388
It's the poetry of physics.

25:17.467 --> 25:20.061
Why do you know so much about this?

25:20.136 --> 25:22.434
Uh, well, I read a lot.

25:22.505 --> 25:25.235
Pretty heady reading,

25:25.308 --> 25:28.903
Einstein and Lemaitre, not to mention the math.

25:28.979 --> 25:31.072
What lured you into it?

25:33.650 --> 25:35.845
Guess I just wanna know why things happen to us.

25:35.919 --> 25:38.251
Don't you think you have a choice?

25:38.321 --> 25:40.346
Do you?

25:40.423 --> 25:42.357
Well, I used to. I'm not sure anymore.

25:43.393 --> 25:45.759
Well, if we did have a choice,

25:45.829 --> 25:48.093
I sure would've made things
happen a lot differently.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.396
Who knows, maybe I'll go back
in time and change it.

25:56.206 --> 25:59.266
- What, you think that's silly?
- No, no. It...

26:01.177 --> 26:03.737
If you could travel back in
time, when would you go back to?

26:05.782 --> 26:09.411
When I was happiest, maybe
six or seven years old.

26:09.486 --> 26:13.149
- Before your father left you?
- How did you know about that?

26:16.293 --> 26:17.909
I guess somebody told me.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.560
Well, nobody could've told you
because I never told anyone.

26:21.631 --> 26:25.067
- Who the hell are you?
- Just a friend.

26:27.537 --> 26:31.234
Look, Donna, it was just a guess. Please.

26:31.308 --> 26:35.904
Please. I noticed you didn't list
a father on your school record,

26:35.979 --> 26:37.913
and you went by your mother's maiden name.

26:37.981 --> 26:41.314
- What were you doing in my records?
- You're in my class.

26:48.992 --> 26:51.153
Let's just keep it at that.

26:52.228 --> 26:54.321
I have a string theory on time.

26:54.397 --> 26:59.460
It's very complex and completely improvable,
but I'd like your opinion.

26:59.536 --> 27:04.371
It's based on an expanding but finite universe.
Well, the universe is infinite.

27:04.441 --> 27:09.174
Maybe not, and if not, then time is finite too.

27:09.245 --> 27:12.510
- I have to go to the library.
- It's a nice public place.

27:56.993 --> 27:59.086
But only in his own lifetime?

28:00.497 --> 28:03.193
Well, that-that's the way I see it.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.860
Ohhh. I think I'm getting a headache.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.869
Yeah, well, it's kind of a lot to,

28:07.937 --> 28:10.201
Oh, no! Stacy's gonna be here in 10 minutes.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.207
I have to open tonight.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.539
I'm sorry, Dr. Bryant. I have kitchen duty.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.602
Well, can we continue this after work?

28:16.679 --> 28:20.046
Sure, as long as, It's public. Yeah.

28:22.118 --> 28:24.109
Bye.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.288
You're not giving away any
trade secrets, are you?

28:30.827 --> 28:33.887
- How long have you been there?
- Eh, long enough to know...

28:33.963 --> 28:37.763
that you could still
construct an atomic bomb if you had to.

28:37.834 --> 28:41.634
An atomic bomb? Al.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.233
Nothing we discussed...

28:45.308 --> 28:48.744
remotely is connected to nuclear detonation.

28:48.812 --> 28:51.781
Al, I was just trying to,

28:56.052 --> 28:59.249
- You're not alone.
- Nope.

28:59.322 --> 29:04.658
- But they can't hear or see me.
- Thank God for little favors.

29:04.727 --> 29:09.596
- Weitzman and the
committee? - I- I can't help you, Sam.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.600
You got to, Al. Look, I figured it out.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.967
Donna left me at the altar. Did the same thing
to the guy she was engaged to before me.

29:15.038 --> 29:18.940
It's a pattern. When she was 8, her father
left and she's never gotten over it.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.374
Al, she blocked out her own father's name.

29:21.444 --> 29:25.972
Don't you see? Donna's never gonna
risk being hurt by a man like that again.

29:26.049 --> 29:29.883
She's gonna go through life
leaving them before they can leave her.

29:29.953 --> 29:35.323
But... But if I can get Donna
and her father together, who knows?

29:35.391 --> 29:38.918
You know, uh, those six doctorates that you hold,

29:39.929 --> 29:42.420
Not one of them is in psychiatry.

29:42.499 --> 29:47.732
Medicine, yes. Uh, quantum physics, yes.

29:47.804 --> 29:50.432
Ancient languages, yes.

29:52.542 --> 29:55.841
- Ancient languages, yes.
- Yes.

29:59.282 --> 30:01.512
The sash?

30:01.584 --> 30:03.984
Brilliant, Sherlock. Hieroglyphics?

30:04.053 --> 30:06.146
I can read hieroglyphics?

30:06.222 --> 30:09.453
Well, you never know unless you try.

30:11.127 --> 30:12.958
It's all just a bunch of pictures to me, Al.

30:13.029 --> 30:15.589
 I can't remember what they... That...

30:15.665 --> 30:19.066
That is a the symbol for a capital.

30:19.135 --> 30:24.072
Um, what was the ancient capital of
Egypt? Memphis! He's in Memphis!

30:24.140 --> 30:26.904
- No, I wouldn't say that, Sam. No.
- Not in Memphis.

30:26.976 --> 30:31.310
Um, maybe the capital of Egypt today
- Don't tell me he's in Cairo.

30:31.381 --> 30:33.248
You're being too literal, Sam.

30:33.283 --> 30:36.265
Well, that hieroglyphic is
the symbol for a capital.

30:36.266 --> 30:37.247
Mm.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.711
Um,

30:41.191 --> 30:43.989
Our capital? You're trying to
tell me he's in Washington.

30:44.060 --> 30:47.496
Good. Okay. Donna's father is in D.C.,

30:47.564 --> 30:51.364
and he, um, is still in the army.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.368
That's the symbol for the pharaoh's army.

30:53.436 --> 30:58.601
Sam. Square times five.

30:58.675 --> 31:02.509
- And in the Pentagon!
- Oh, I'd give you one of these if I could.

31:02.579 --> 31:05.412
I need his name, Al.

31:05.481 --> 31:08.746
That's, uh... That's ridiculous.

31:08.818 --> 31:13.585
Uh, Sam, Ziggy is scanning my
side of this conversation,

31:13.656 --> 31:17.456
and he thinks I'm trying to
communicate to you in a code.

31:19.662 --> 31:21.357
What hieroglyphics?

31:21.431 --> 31:26.869
Hey! How can I write
Colonel Wojohowitz in hieroglyphics?

31:31.207 --> 31:33.402
Al!

31:34.611 --> 31:37.171
Did you call me, Dr. Bryant?

31:39.315 --> 31:41.647
If I asked you to go to Washington,
would you do it?

31:42.852 --> 31:44.786
Dr. Bryant, I was just getting to like you.

31:44.854 --> 31:47.118
Don't treat me like that. I'm
not treating you like that.

31:47.190 --> 31:50.216
If I were 15 years younger or
this was 15 years later, I would,

31:50.293 --> 31:52.227
but I can't now.

31:52.295 --> 31:54.627
Donna, it's important.

31:54.697 --> 31:58.224
Hell, I'll bring a chaperone.

31:58.301 --> 32:00.235
We can be there and back in a day.

32:00.303 --> 32:02.601
To do what?

32:04.641 --> 32:07.166
Save a lost love.

32:19.989 --> 32:22.617
- Colonel Wojohowitz.
- Thank God.

32:22.692 --> 32:25.820
What? Uh, Colonel, you
don't know me. My name is Bryant,

32:25.895 --> 32:27.863
Dr, Gerald Bryant, and I'm on the faculty...

32:27.930 --> 32:29.864
at Lawrence College in Marion, Ohio.

32:29.932 --> 32:32.025
Yes? Uh, I was wondering if I could see you.

32:32.101 --> 32:35.093
Dr. Bryant, I ship out
for Vietnam at 0800 tomorrow.

32:35.171 --> 32:37.105
Vietnam.

32:37.173 --> 32:40.631
I'm sure you've heard of it. Of course. I just...

32:40.710 --> 32:42.974
Doctor, I'm very busy. Would
you get to the point?

32:43.046 --> 32:46.482
It's your daughter.

32:53.856 --> 32:55.585
Colonel, are you there?

32:57.327 --> 32:58.316
Yes.

33:00.196 --> 33:03.654
- Do you remember Donna?
- Of course I remember Donna.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.701
She needs you, sir.

33:06.736 --> 33:10.194
Is she hurt? No. Uh, not physically.

33:11.307 --> 33:14.902
Colonel, since you're shipping out tomorrow,
I don't have time to be subtle about this.

33:14.977 --> 33:17.912
I don't know why you left your family.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.574
But your leaving and never
contacting her again...

33:20.650 --> 33:22.743
has affected Donna's ability to love anyone else.

33:22.819 --> 33:28.155
Dr. Bryant, the breakup with her
mother and I had nothing to do with her.

33:28.224 --> 33:32.126
She doesn't think you love her, that if
you did, you wouldn't have abandoned her.

33:32.195 --> 33:34.356
I love my daughter. I loved her very much.

33:35.498 --> 33:37.432
I'm not going to reopen this wound...

33:37.500 --> 33:39.559
not when I'm shipping out.

33:41.170 --> 33:42.115
Maybe when I come back.

33:42.116 --> 33:46.198
Well, forgive me, sir, but, uh,
what if you don't come back?

33:47.744 --> 33:49.803
Good-bye, Dr. Bryant.

33:53.249 --> 33:56.343
Just a damn minute!

33:58.488 --> 34:01.184
Look...

34:10.699 --> 34:13.293
I told you I'd be back.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.705
Okay. All right.

34:20.777 --> 34:23.041
So...

34:23.112 --> 34:25.045
...my advice didn't work.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.047
Right. Right. Right?

34:27.116 --> 34:30.085
What happened? I did what you told me.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.280
I, uh, I read her poetry.

34:32.355 --> 34:35.916
I told her that her perfume made me
horny and that her lips made me even hornier.

34:35.992 --> 34:37.583
I get the idea. And then,

34:37.659 --> 34:40.150
I get the idea! Look, Oscar,

34:41.664 --> 34:43.632
"horny" isn't romantic.

34:43.699 --> 34:46.293
Well, it is to me. Not to Jamie-Lee.

34:46.369 --> 34:50.237
To Jamie-Lee,

34:50.306 --> 34:52.774
"breathless with passion"...

34:52.842 --> 34:55.639
...is romantic.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.679
Do you have a car?

34:58.681 --> 35:00.512
O.

35:00.583 --> 35:03.552
Triple deuce, Hurst
four-speed, 3-9-0 rear end, mag wheels.

35:03.619 --> 35:07.020
Uh, will it hold four people?

35:07.089 --> 35:09.182
Maybe. Say, me,

35:09.258 --> 35:12.921
and Donna Eleese and you and Jamie-Lee?

35:12.995 --> 35:14.860
In that order?

35:14.931 --> 35:17.491
Yeah, in that order.

35:27.076 --> 35:29.806
- Did you see him?
- Bang.

35:29.879 --> 35:35.408
You'd shoot that magnificent creature?

35:35.485 --> 35:38.921
It was a buck. Bambi was a buck!

35:39.989 --> 35:42.184
I want to change seats, please.

35:42.258 --> 35:45.591
Jamie-Lee, Romeo hunted deer.

35:46.762 --> 35:49.094
He did? Yes, he did.

35:49.165 --> 35:53.431
- And, uh, as well as...
- Lancelot.

35:53.503 --> 35:57.599
Lancelot. You know, I bet
Lancelot brought Guinevere a deer a week.

35:58.741 --> 36:01.073
And Rochester rode on stag hunts.

36:01.143 --> 36:03.043
That's right.

36:03.112 --> 36:07.208
The first time Blanche came to Thornwood
she rode to the hounds.

36:09.785 --> 36:12.219
Is that how you hunt stag?

36:13.789 --> 36:15.723
Mm, sort a.

36:20.263 --> 36:23.721
And while Lennon read a book on Marx

36:23.799 --> 36:27.235
The quartet practiced in the park

36:27.303 --> 36:30.466
And we sang dirges in the dark

36:30.540 --> 36:35.739
The day the music died Fill 'er up?

36:35.811 --> 36:38.245
Yep. Okay.

36:38.314 --> 36:40.248
Where's the bathroom? Uh, back there.

36:40.316 --> 36:43.251
Where's the key? Key? We don't have no key.

36:53.663 --> 36:57.690
Al! Thank God you're here. I thought
I'd never see you again.

36:57.767 --> 36:59.701
I figured that they'd pulled you off the project.

36:59.769 --> 37:04.035
Oh, they did. They fed the
hieroglyphics into Ziggy, and then they fired me.

37:04.106 --> 37:06.199
They can't do that. Tell Weitzman.

37:06.275 --> 37:11.042
But it's unimportant. What's
important is he's had a change of heart.

37:11.113 --> 37:12.774
I didn't think Weitzman had a heart.

37:12.848 --> 37:14.782
He probably doesn't, but his wife does.

37:14.850 --> 37:16.690
You slept with his wife?

37:16.691 --> 37:20.447
I would never do
anything so unscrupulous as that,

37:20.523 --> 37:23.048
unless it was Bartlett's wife.

37:23.125 --> 37:26.060
Now, there is a woman to get fired over.

37:27.163 --> 37:29.222
Ran into her one time at the fights.

37:29.298 --> 37:32.563
Uh, Barlett was at some, I
don't know, some seminar in Utah.

37:32.635 --> 37:35.570
And it was her birthday, and
you know, the fool forgot.

37:35.638 --> 37:39.005
What happened? Oh, well,
we had a couple of drinks,

37:39.075 --> 37:42.442
a nice rare steak with green chiles
- With Weitzman!

37:42.511 --> 37:44.706
Oh! Weitzman.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.714
You know Tina? Yeah.

37:46.782 --> 37:48.613
Weitzman knows her too.

37:48.684 --> 37:52.313
You set Tina up with
Weitzman and then blackmailed him?

37:53.656 --> 37:55.590
Yeah. That...

37:55.658 --> 37:59.424
Unscrupulous, but effective.

38:00.997 --> 38:04.763
At least you're here. That's
the way I figured it.

38:04.834 --> 38:08.235
Now, I had Ziggy compute the odds...

38:08.304 --> 38:12.968
on your being right about
fixing Donna's hang-up.

38:14.076 --> 38:16.044
Pretty low, huh?

38:16.112 --> 38:18.876
Well, if you get Donna and her father together,

38:18.948 --> 38:24.045
the odds are 4-to-1 that she'll commit
to a relationship in the future.

38:24.120 --> 38:29.183
Al, no offense, but this time I'm
gonna make Ziggy my best man.

38:29.258 --> 38:32.056
Wait a minute. You're forgetting something.

38:32.128 --> 38:36.622
What? Well, she was engaged to
someone before she even met you.

38:36.699 --> 38:39.793
Yeah? Yeah, so if you pull this off,

38:39.869 --> 38:42.030
she could marry this other jerk first.

38:57.386 --> 38:59.854
Confession time.

38:59.922 --> 39:02.322
What?

39:02.391 --> 39:06.691
I used to think you wrote your
book just to pick up young, naive coeds.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.799
You really are romantic, aren't you?

39:10.867 --> 39:11.728
Well...

39:11.839 --> 39:15.328
I mean, you’re trying to
get these two back together,

39:15.404 --> 39:18.669
driving 400 miles for the sake of a lost love.

39:21.444 --> 39:25.210
What I don't understand is
why you wanted me here.

39:26.282 --> 39:29.877
You remind me of her. Twelve
years younger, but...

39:29.952 --> 39:32.785
you're her.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.725
Sweet, bright. She's a quantum physicist.

39:37.793 --> 39:40.091
That's why you read those books.

39:40.162 --> 39:44.394
We were very much in love, engaged to be married.

39:44.467 --> 39:48.597
In fact, we had a wedding, or, rather, I did.

39:48.671 --> 39:50.400
She didn't show?

39:55.044 --> 39:57.638
Why?

39:58.647 --> 40:00.706
I think she was afraid to commit.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.751
Afraid...

40:03.819 --> 40:06.049
that I'd leave her...

40:06.122 --> 40:08.317
the way her father left her.

40:09.358 --> 40:12.555
I don't wanna see you run away
when your chance for happiness comes.

40:12.628 --> 40:16.155
That's why I'm taking you to see your father.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.494
You're taking me to see my father?

40:20.636 --> 40:22.160
Yes.

40:31.847 --> 40:35.010
You really are romantic.

40:36.018 --> 40:39.715
<i>To show I love you</i>

40:39.789 --> 40:42.587
<i>Thinking of you</i>

40:42.658 --> 40:47.686
<i>Write your name across the sky... </i>

40:59.875 --> 41:01.740
May I help you?

41:01.811 --> 41:03.904
Yeah. We're just going up
to see Colonel Wojohowitz.

41:03.979 --> 41:05.913
Can I have your names, please?

41:05.981 --> 41:10.077
Yeah. I'm Dr. Gerald Bryant and
this is the Colonel's daughter, Donna.

41:10.152 --> 41:13.246
Oh. Colonel Wojohowitz. Oh, thanks.

41:13.322 --> 41:15.256
Uh, sir, excuse me.

41:15.324 --> 41:17.485
The Colonel has a "Do not disturb" on his line.

41:18.794 --> 41:20.728
Well, this is his daughter.

41:20.796 --> 41:23.196
Could we see some
identification, Miss Wojohowitz?

41:23.265 --> 41:25.893
Oh, I use my mother's maiden name.

41:27.336 --> 41:30.737
I'm sorry, but unless you can prove you're
his daughter, I can't ring through.

41:31.941 --> 41:33.875
You're welcome to wait here
and catch him when he leaves.

41:33.943 --> 41:37.435
Well, that'll be a little late. He's
shipping out to Vietnam this morning.

41:37.513 --> 41:42.109
Look, she's driven all
night from Ohio to see her father.

41:42.184 --> 41:44.118
Couldn't you just please...

41:44.186 --> 41:46.552
call him on the phone and tell
him that his daughter's here?

41:46.622 --> 41:49.250
I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that.

41:49.325 --> 41:51.793
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

42:09.245 --> 42:11.304
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

42:12.982 --> 42:15.473
You sound like Ziggy. Who?

42:22.024 --> 42:24.151
Something about that guy bothers me.

42:30.499 --> 42:33.764
There's a car in visitor's
lot. I didn't see it there earlier.

42:45.381 --> 42:47.315
Harry, this car has Ohio plates.

42:47.383 --> 42:49.248
Check the back. I'll put Jeff on alert.

42:49.318 --> 42:51.252
Roger.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.619
Oh, no. We're gonna get in trouble.

42:55.691 --> 42:58.319
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.031
So it wasn't meant to be?

43:44.673 --> 43:47.335
This was a mistake.

43:48.410 --> 43:53.643
No. The mistake was waiting 10 years.

43:59.521 --> 44:02.718
I'm sorry, baby. I love you.

44:02.791 --> 44:04.725
Ohhh.

44:04.793 --> 44:07.887
That's all I wanted to hear, Daddy.

44:15.971 --> 44:17.905
Don't leave.

44:20.476 --> 44:22.410
I'll be in the car.

44:24.980 --> 44:27.847
Uh, if only you were a little...

44:27.916 --> 44:29.907
Little younger?

44:29.985 --> 44:34.183
Uh, or I was a little older.

44:37.826 --> 44:39.817
You will be.

44:52.408 --> 44:54.376
Where's Jerry?

44:55.677 --> 44:57.645
You don't need Dr. Bryant.

44:59.415 --> 45:01.474
Not with me here.

45:03.285 --> 45:06.015
Well,

45:06.088 --> 45:08.454
you are big.

45:18.934 --> 45:21.562
Harry, we got an open door.

45:24.139 --> 45:28.405
Police, this is the
Watergate. We have a break-in here.

45:28.477 --> 45:30.911
Jamie-Lee,

45:30.979 --> 45:32.970
you make me so hor...

45:34.716 --> 45:36.809
breathless with passion.

45:47.996 --> 45:50.590
You seem pretty pleased with yourself.

45:52.067 --> 45:54.160
Yeah.

45:54.236 --> 45:56.636
Mm. Well, so am I.

45:56.705 --> 46:00.471
'Course, Ziggy's blowing out microchips
like they were popcorn.

46:00.542 --> 46:02.407
He just... He didn't see it coming.

46:02.478 --> 46:03.945
What? What?

46:04.012 --> 46:08.108
Sam, this is the 17 th of June, 1972.

46:08.183 --> 46:11.516
So? So?

46:11.587 --> 46:13.748
We're in the Watergate!

46:14.756 --> 46:18.715
Break-in. Nixon. Impeachment.

46:20.429 --> 46:22.363
I don't remember.

46:22.431 --> 46:25.491
Oh, boy. The Republicans would love you.

46:32.040 --> 46:34.235
You know, I don't understand you, pal.

46:34.309 --> 46:37.574
Well, you're wearing that goofball grin...

46:37.646 --> 46:41.912
and Donna is probably gonna end up
marrying that sucker that she hooked before you.

46:41.984 --> 46:46.250
Maybe not. Maybe she'll jilt him and marry me.

46:46.321 --> 46:49.722
Wanna bet? Yeah. I got connections.

46:51.326 --> 46:55.057
Then how come you haven't leaped yet?

47:09.077 --> 47:11.102
Maybe I need a shotgun...

47:22.124 --> 47:25.252
Get up.! Get up.! One, two, three...

47:25.327 --> 47:27.659
Up! Up! Come on! four,

47:27.729 --> 47:29.993
five, six.
