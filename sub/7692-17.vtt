WE'RE IN CRISIS!

10:08.338 --> 10:13.313

IF SHE SEES US USING OUR BIONICS
AND TELLS DAVENPORT?

10:13.313 --> 10:15.615
I MEAN, HE ALREADY KNOWS.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.690
WAIT! GUYS, I KNOW!

10:19.690 --> 10:22.192
WHY DON'T WE JUST USE
DAVENPORT'S INVISIBILITY CLOAK

TO SNEAK INTO PERRY'S OFFICE

10:23.694 --> 10:25.225

THE CAMERA'S HARD DRIVE!

10:25.225 --> 10:26.997

PARENT/TEACHER NIGHT STARTS.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.340
DAVENPORT AND TASHA
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.643
ONE OF US
HAS TO GET THAT HARD DRIVE.

10:48.919 --> 10:54.384
OKAY, WELL, YOU GUYS
SEEM TO HAVE A HANDLE ON THIS.

10:54.384 --> 10:56.386
I'M GONNA BOUNCE. GOOD LUCK!

10:56.386 --> 10:58.759
NO, THEO, WE NEED YOU!

10:58.759 --> 11:01.361
IF WE GET CAUGHT, DAVENPORT
WILL PULL US OUT OF SCHOOL!

11:01.361 --> 11:05.165
YEAH, AND HE'S NOT
GONNA PULL YOU OUT.
YOU'RE USELESS TO HIM.

MY STELLAR STUDENT?

12:51.471 --> 12:55.275
LEO. WHERE'S LEO?

12:55.275 --> 12:59.279
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,
BY I DO KNOW ONE THING, DOOLEY!

12:59.279 --> 13:02.482
HELLO, WELCOME.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.986
IF I EVER FIND YOU
IN MY OFFICE AGAIN,
I WILL BREAK EVERY SINGLE--

13:05.986 --> 13:09.359
HELP YOURSELF
TO THE CHEESE AND CRACKERS.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.222
MOM! ( laughs nervously )

13:12.222 --> 13:13.223
HELLO.

13:13.223 --> 13:15.395
MOM, THIS IS
PRINCIPAL PERRY.

13:15.395 --> 13:19.529
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
MY EXTREMELY SYMPATHETIC
AND UNDERSTANDING MOTHER.

13:19.529 --> 13:23.473
I CAUGHT THIS TROUBLEMAKER
SNEAKING AROUND IN MY OFFICE.

13:23.473 --> 13:25.976
OOH, TROUBLEMAKER.

13:25.976 --> 13:29.239
TROUBLEMAKER? TROUBLEMAKER?
 MM-HMM. YEAH.

13:29.239 --> 13:34.044
LEO, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
SNEAKING INTO THIS
NICE WOMAN'S OFFICE?

13:34.044 --> 13:36.416
I WASN'T SNEAKING INTO
A NICE WOMAN'S OFFICE,

13:36.416 --> 13:38.418
I WAS SNEAKING
INTO HER OFFICE.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.921
LEO!

13:40.921 --> 13:44.294
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY.

13:44.294 --> 13:45.295
( sighs )

13:45.295 --> 13:49.900
THIS MUST BE
SO DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.562
YOU GUYS KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

13:52.562 --> 13:54.104
NOTHING.
 NOT A CLUE.

13:54.104 --> 13:55.906
HE'S WORKING ALONE.

13:57.407 --> 14:01.611
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU,
LEO, AND YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO THAT CONCERT.

14:01.611 --> 14:02.612
WHAT?!
 MM-MM.

14:02.612 --> 14:04.114
BUT I--
 NO.

14:04.114 --> 14:05.475
BUT THEY--
 NO.

14:05.475 --> 14:07.517
BUT FINE.

14:07.517 --> 14:12.082
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO
INTO THE GYM AND I SHOW YOU
THAT ROPE HE CAN'T CLIMB?

14:12.082 --> 14:13.283
( laughs )

14:24.334 --> 14:25.335
AH, YES!

14:26.566 --> 14:27.998
Principal Perry: RIGHT THIS WAY.
 NO!

14:27.998 --> 14:29.569
Principal Perry: MY OFFICE
IS RIGHT DOWN THIS HALL.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.441
( loud whoosh )

14:31.441 --> 14:35.375
DON'T YOU WISH KIDS
HAD A RETURN POLICY?

14:35.375 --> 14:36.876
( both laugh )

14:36.876 --> 14:39.049
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR OTHER THREE.

14:39.049 --> 14:40.510
THEY'RE GREAT,
AREN'T THEY?

14:40.510 --> 14:42.182
NO.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.621
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S
FASCINATING ABOUT THIS OFFICE?

14:51.621 --> 14:52.662
THE FLOOR.

14:52.662 --> 14:54.594
AND I THINK EVERYONE
SHOULD LOOK AT IT!

14:54.594 --> 14:56.596
LET'S LOOK AT THE FLOOR!

14:56.596 --> 14:58.898
HEY, EYES ON THE PRIZE.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.601
LET'S START WITH
THE TALL ONE.
 ADAM.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.604
YEAH, OR AS I LIKE TO CALL HIM,
EMPTY BOX ON A NECK.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.036
( laughs )

15:12.282 --> 15:15.285
( laughs nervously )
ALMOST DROPPED MY GUM.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.619
HEY, NO GUM IN SCHOOL!

15:19.619 --> 15:21.651
SPIT IT OUT!

15:21.651 --> 15:24.194
YOU COULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT
TWO SECONDS AGO?

15:41.671 --> 15:43.643
WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

15:43.643 --> 15:46.146
THAT IS, UH...

15:46.146 --> 15:47.477
MINE.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.550
IT'S FOR WINDY DAYS.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.526
YOU WERE SAYING?

15:56.526 --> 15:59.529
WHY TELL YOU
WHEN I COULD SHOW YOU?

15:59.529 --> 16:03.333
UGH! WHERE IS THAT HARD DRIVE?!

16:16.146 --> 16:17.977
DON'T GO ANYWHERE, OR ELSE!

16:19.279 --> 16:22.612
I MEAN, PLEASE,
MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

16:22.612 --> 16:25.415
( laughs )

16:25.415 --> 16:27.657
( loud whoosh )

16:27.657 --> 16:29.689
WHAT IS GOING ON?!

16:29.689 --> 16:32.322
IT'S A LONG STORY.
 WELL, TALK FAST!

16:32.322 --> 16:34.664
WE WERE HANGING OUT
IN THE HALLWAY WHEN CHASE
WAS LIKE, "WHAT'S THAT NOISE?"

16:34.664 --> 16:36.666
AND I WAS LIKE, "MOVE,"
AND ADAM WAS LIKE, "I GOT IT."

16:36.666 --> 16:39.669
SO THEN WE USED OUR BIONICS
TO SAVE LEO FROM GETTING
PANCAKED BY AN AIR CONDITIONER.

16:39.669 --> 16:43.173
BAD NEWS--
CAMERAS RECORDED EVERYTHING
AND IT'S ALL ON THIS HARD DRIVE.

16:43.173 --> 16:45.675
( chuckles )
IS THAT ALL?

16:45.675 --> 16:47.337
AND WE USED
YOUR INVISIBILITY CLOAK,

16:47.337 --> 16:49.339
SO YOUR TOP-SECRET
MILLION-DOLLAR TECHNOLOGY
MAY BE RUINED,

16:49.339 --> 16:51.341
BUT, YEAH,
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

16:53.283 --> 16:55.745
GIVE ME THE HARD DRIVE!
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF IT!

16:55.745 --> 16:57.187
( loud whoosh )

16:57.187 --> 16:58.518
HMM.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.150
( laughs nervously )

17:01.751 --> 17:04.124
FOUND IT.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.695
OH, I COULD KISS YOU!

17:06.695 --> 17:09.559
PLEASE DON'T.

17:09.559 --> 17:11.231
FORK IT OVER.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.703
BREE, WHAT IS TAKING SO L--
UH, I MEAN...

17:13.703 --> 17:16.236
OOPS, THIS ISN'T THE MEN'S ROOM!

17:16.236 --> 17:18.268
WHY WOULD I BE SITTING
IN THE MEN'S ROOM?

17:18.268 --> 17:21.241
BECAUSE ANYTHING ELSE
WOULD BE UNLADYLIKE.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.575
BYE!
 STOP! TURN! SIT!

17:28.117 --> 17:31.681
JUST ONE MORE CONNECTION...

17:34.784 --> 17:36.626
QUICK! CRUSH THAT HARD DRIVE!

17:36.626 --> 17:39.789
BUT YOU TOLD US
NEVER USE BIONICS IN SCHOOL.

17:39.789 --> 17:44.464
AND YET HERE WE ARE.
SO FORGET WHAT I SAID
AND CRUSH IT!

17:46.166 --> 17:49.439
AW, THAT'S SO PRETTY!
IS THAT SOMETHING NEW
YOU'RE TRYING?

17:51.571 --> 17:52.842
JUST CRUSH IT!

17:54.244 --> 17:58.678
( loud whoosh )

18:06.286 --> 18:10.560
TALK ABOUT GETTING
CAUGHT UP IN YOUR WORK.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.791
( all laugh )

18:11.791 --> 18:12.792
( screams )

18:12.792 --> 18:14.664
ONE OF YOU DID THIS!

18:14.664 --> 18:18.398
YOU, YOU, YOU, OR YOU!

18:18.398 --> 18:20.430
I WAS STANDING HERE
THE WHOLE TIME!

18:20.430 --> 18:21.771
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING!

18:21.771 --> 18:24.804
UGH! THIS IS NOT OVER!

18:24.804 --> 18:27.337
OH, I THINK IT IS.

18:27.337 --> 18:30.680
AIR-CONDITIONING UNITS
FALLING FROM OUT OF NOWHERE,

18:30.680 --> 18:32.682
ILLEGAL BACKPACK SEARCHES,

18:32.682 --> 18:35.545
RECORDING STUDENTS
WITHOUT CONSENT--

18:35.545 --> 18:38.388
DOES THE SCHOOL BOARD
KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

18:38.388 --> 18:40.720
( stammering )

18:40.720 --> 18:45.395
LIKE I WAS SAYING, LET'S PUT
THIS WHOLE THING BEHIND US!

18:47.397 --> 18:48.858
WAY TO LAWYER UP, BIG D.

18:48.858 --> 18:50.160
( chuckles )

18:54.704 --> 18:56.706
NICE MEETING YOU.

18:56.706 --> 18:59.369
THANK YOU FOR THE CHEESE.

19:09.479 --> 19:10.620
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.622
I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT
MY FIRST PARENT/TEACHER NIGHT

19:12.622 --> 19:14.454
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS!

19:14.454 --> 19:17.387
MAINLY BECAUSE I WILL NEVER
BE ASKED TO GO AGAIN.

19:17.387 --> 19:18.558
POINT DAVENPORT.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.560
UP TOP.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.332
( chuckles )

19:22.332 --> 19:23.493
SO ARE WE IN TROUBLE?

19:23.493 --> 19:25.565
I'M GONNA LET
THIS ONE SLIDE...

19:25.565 --> 19:30.440
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
DID SAVE LEO FROM BEING
CRUSHED BY AN AIR CONDITIONER.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.902
AND BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU GUYS HAVE EVER USED

19:32.902 --> 19:35.445
YOUR BIONICS
AT SCHOOL BEFORE, RIGHT?

19:35.445 --> 19:36.476
NEVER.
 EVER.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.478
SOMETIMES.

19:38.478 --> 19:42.482
SAVED IT!

19:43.953 --> 19:46.416
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

19:46.416 --> 19:49.419
WELL, SINCE I COULDN'T TELL
PRINCIPAL PERRY THE TRUTH,

19:49.419 --> 19:53.723
I HAD TO CLEAN EVERY BATHROOM
IN THE SCHOOL.

19:53.723 --> 19:56.726
I'VE SCRUBBED, I'VE SCRAPED,
I GOT A LITTLE NAUSEOUS,

19:56.726 --> 20:00.300
BUT LUCKILY
I WAS IN THE BATHROOM,
SO THAT WORKED OUT.

20:01.631 --> 20:03.803
OH, BY THE WAY,
HERE'S YOUR INVISIBILITY CLOAK.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.636
SORRY IT'S WET.
I USED IT AS A MOP.

20:09.439 --> 20:11.311
( sighs )

20:11.311 --> 20:13.413
LEO, THANKS FOR
HAVING OUR BACKS.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.484
YEAH.

20:14.484 --> 20:17.247
IT WAS COOL OF YOU
TO COVER FOR US LIKE THAT.

20:17.247 --> 20:18.888
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

20:18.888 --> 20:21.891
I DIDN'T GET FLATTENED
BY AN AIR CONDITIONER,
YOUR BIONICS DIDN'T GET EXPOSED,

20:21.891 --> 20:26.426
AND I STILL GET TO GO
TO THE RIFFRAFF JAMMY JAM!

20:26.426 --> 20:28.828
COOL, MAYBE WE CAN ALL GO.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.332
WHOO-HOO! WE ARE GOING
TO THE RIFFRAFF JAMMY JAM!

20:32.332 --> 20:35.505
RIFFRAFF JAMMY JAM!
RIFFRAFF!

20:35.505 --> 20:38.308
NOT WITH MOVES LIKE THAT.
