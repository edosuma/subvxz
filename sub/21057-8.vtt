00:36.539 --> 00:41.679
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:44.219 --> 00:45.619
- Right this way. - Thank you.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.990
Yes, thank you.

00:49.719 --> 00:51.820
- You're here? Right this way. - Hi.

00:52.890 --> 00:53.890
Right here.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.670
- Gi Ok! - Hey!

01:01.329 --> 01:02.670
- Hello. - Hello.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.299
Put those flowers down here.

01:07.269 --> 01:08.469
The boxes should be here.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.079
A Jin, it's about to start. Please come in.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.650
Sure, I'm almost finished.

01:16.549 --> 01:18.579
Please start delivering these in one hour.

01:18.750 --> 01:21.450
Put a bottle of champagne and a plate of canape on each table.

01:21.650 --> 01:22.819
Sure, ma'am.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.819
There is a transparent glass ceiling...

01:51.049 --> 01:52.920
between the upper class and the lower class.

01:53.549 --> 01:55.250
You may think that you can go beyond...

01:55.349 --> 01:57.260
the ceiling because you can clearly see it,

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
but the truth is,

01:58.859 --> 02:01.959
the glamorous world is blocked by an impenetrable glass.

02:02.959 --> 02:04.200
I'm certain that...

02:04.400 --> 02:06.060
no one from the upper class thinks they might...

02:06.159 --> 02:07.200
step into what's beneath the glass ceiling.

02:07.829 --> 02:10.770
That's because of the glass floor they're standing on.

02:11.569 --> 02:13.870
The transparent but firm glass,

02:13.969 --> 02:15.270
inevitably keeping the lower class...

02:15.439 --> 02:16.469
separated from the upper class.

02:25.250 --> 02:28.250
However, there's something that they've forgotten.

02:29.789 --> 02:32.719
Glass floors may be transparent,

02:33.289 --> 02:35.060
but they can be shattered.

02:42.030 --> 02:44.699
That was made by an artist, so it's one of a kind!

02:46.270 --> 02:48.909
Why do expensive things break so easily?

02:53.710 --> 02:55.849
I need to talk to you for a moment.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.860
What is it, Cho Hui?

03:10.430 --> 03:14.669
Don't call me by that name ever again.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.240
I'm sorry. It became a habit.

03:17.439 --> 03:20.639
I'm not Park Cho Hui anymore.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.870
I'm the madam of Daesung Pulp.

03:23.810 --> 03:26.979
Let me warn you again. Be careful in front of other people.

03:28.379 --> 03:31.379
I trust you. You know that, right?

03:32.280 --> 03:33.789
Of course, I know that.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.349
I understand what you're saying. Don't worry.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.060
Just do your job perfectly.

03:39.159 --> 03:42.389
If you do that, I will compensate you well.

03:42.789 --> 03:47.069
I got it. I'll become your eyes and ears as you want.

04:50.029 --> 04:51.600
I have to buy that one.

04:54.199 --> 04:58.339
This is too big for me, but I'm going to buy it!

04:58.540 --> 05:01.540
No one can call dibs on this one! This one is mine!

05:02.769 --> 05:04.980
This is why I like her!

05:05.480 --> 05:07.680
Did you hear that? She said it's big!

05:12.980 --> 05:14.720
Let me see how it looks on you.

05:16.019 --> 05:17.089
It's huge!

05:22.589 --> 05:24.129
But why isn't she here yet?

05:37.079 --> 05:39.879
Hello, Ms. Seo. I apologize for being late.

05:40.379 --> 05:42.209
I'll introduce you to everyone. Follow me.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.889
- This is our rookie artist. - Hello.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.620
(Executive Director Ahn Jae Seok)

06:04.139 --> 06:05.170
The marketing team's campaign...

06:05.170 --> 06:07.910
to give free sanity pads to low-income families...

06:09.870 --> 06:12.410
Sir, are you worried about something?

06:13.180 --> 06:15.079
You're definitely my sun.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.720
The earth needs a sun, but it needs a moon too.

06:20.189 --> 06:21.920
The sun comes out during the day...

06:23.519 --> 06:25.189
and the moon comes out at night.

06:27.629 --> 06:29.230
Imagine if we only had a sun.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.329
We wouldn't be able to live with that.

06:33.529 --> 06:36.329
Wait, why are you worrying about such a thing?

06:38.040 --> 06:42.009
You seriously lack romance, Mr. Park.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.040
You're very lucky to be such a romanticist.

06:49.579 --> 06:50.879
Payment documents.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.360
- I'll see you later. - Sure.

06:57.519 --> 06:58.660
- Good work today. - Thank you.

07:21.350 --> 07:22.509
Did you buy anything?

07:22.610 --> 07:24.350
I bought a decorative piece made of Thai elephant enamel...

07:24.519 --> 07:26.720
and a wallet that Ms. Jung of Sungwoo Group put up for sale.

07:26.819 --> 07:27.920
How much I donated is a secret.

07:29.290 --> 07:31.660
By the way, have you heard?

07:32.319 --> 07:36.129
Bong Sik was attacked in a parking lot and got severely hurt.

07:36.899 --> 07:38.000
Gosh, really?

07:38.360 --> 07:39.399
Yes.

07:39.699 --> 07:42.300
What do we do? We live in a dangerous world.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.540
How could that happen?

07:44.670 --> 07:46.199
He was beaten to the brink of death.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.569
You sound sad that he didn't actually die.

07:50.980 --> 07:53.879
It's not like I live with my husband out of affection.

07:54.079 --> 07:56.009
You don't have to pretend when it's just the two of us.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.980
I'm glad I have a comrade.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.290
Let's drink to that.

08:04.660 --> 08:07.329
- Why won't you divorce him? - How would I feed myself if I do?

08:08.490 --> 08:10.759
That's a universal and simple reason.

08:10.959 --> 08:11.959
Why won't you get a divorce?

08:12.399 --> 08:13.430
It's because of the kids.

08:13.629 --> 08:16.100
That's a humane and understandable reason.

08:16.839 --> 08:18.800
- Get a boyfriend. - I have one already.

08:19.170 --> 08:20.209
Really?

08:21.170 --> 08:22.839
Do you think you're the only one with a boyfriend?

08:24.579 --> 08:26.480
He broke four ribs...

08:26.709 --> 08:29.279
and those broken ribs caused a lung injury.

08:30.279 --> 08:32.450
They said it was pretty much an attempted murder.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.350
Do you know the director of that plastic surgery clinic?

08:35.750 --> 08:37.389
The doctor that Gyeong Hui is seeing.

08:37.919 --> 08:38.919
Do you think it was him?

08:39.259 --> 08:41.230
Hey, no way! Why would that doctor...

08:41.429 --> 08:43.360
hit that woman's husband?

08:43.600 --> 08:47.570
I heard that golfer hits his wife a lot.

08:47.730 --> 08:48.870
Why does she let him hit her?

08:49.429 --> 08:52.639
His wife can't have children. I heard she's infertile.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.009
Is that why she treats Yun Jae so well?

08:56.570 --> 08:57.710
I guess she's giving him affection...

08:57.809 --> 09:00.149
because she can't have kids of her own.

09:01.110 --> 09:02.149
I feel bad for her.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.750
She's got a pretty face, she should just find a better man.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.820
But doesn't Dr. Jang's wife know?

09:08.419 --> 09:10.659
I'm pretty sure everyone knows that her husband...

09:10.820 --> 09:12.159
is cheating on her.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.289
Dr. Jang's family aren't members of the Pungsuk's Kitchen.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.029
That's why she has no source to hear this from.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.600
By the way, have you heard?

09:20.230 --> 09:22.830
Chairman Ahn's house hired a new maid.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.970
Apparently, his new wife hired her.

09:25.169 --> 09:27.570
You're having an easy time calling Bok Ja his new wife.

09:27.740 --> 09:30.139
Anyway, you're the best at adjusting to new situations.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.450
The gossips from Pungsuk's Kitchen are...

09:33.850 --> 09:36.049
the fastest and the most precise ones.

09:36.820 --> 09:39.480
However, thanks to the secretive cook,

09:39.779 --> 09:41.519
no one found out about Jae Seok's affair...

09:41.690 --> 09:44.590
even in Pungsuk's Kitchen.

09:46.990 --> 09:49.929
And there was another secret...

09:50.029 --> 09:53.629
that the ladies of Pungsuk's Kitchen didn't realize.

10:23.759 --> 10:25.799
Dad, are you going to do whatever that woman wants?

10:26.029 --> 10:28.629
"That woman"? You punk.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.269
Watch your mouth.

10:30.470 --> 10:32.970
You're talking as if you're uneducated.

10:33.169 --> 10:36.470
Dad, if you spoil her, she'll develop bad habits.

10:36.679 --> 10:39.379
I know that all too well. That's what happened to you.

10:39.879 --> 10:41.809
I really hate the new maid too.

10:42.279 --> 10:44.820
Why do you care? You're going to go home soon.

10:45.279 --> 10:47.820
I'm your daughter! I have the right to butt in!

10:47.919 --> 10:49.289
That's enough! I'll do whatever I want!

10:49.690 --> 10:51.789
You better not give her any financial rights.

10:52.059 --> 10:54.659
Why are you interfering? Go home.

10:54.929 --> 10:56.860
I won't. No, I can't.

10:58.029 --> 11:00.529
Give me two million dollars. Then I'll back down for now.

11:01.129 --> 11:02.129
Just for now.

11:02.769 --> 11:05.399
- That means I'll go home. - Get lost.

11:06.139 --> 11:07.840
I don't want to see any of my kids.

11:10.980 --> 11:11.980
You always tell me to get lost.

11:17.679 --> 11:18.679
"Get lost."

11:18.720 --> 11:20.450
Where am I supposed to go? I have nowhere to go.

11:21.519 --> 11:22.590
It's a snake...

11:23.559 --> 11:24.620
Jae Hui, do you want food?

11:25.120 --> 11:26.730
What? "Jae Hui"?

11:28.559 --> 11:31.159
Lady, is this your first time working for someone else's house?

11:31.759 --> 11:34.230
I was self-employed. This is my first time doing this kind of job.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.230
I'm speechless.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.340
You should know your place.

11:38.669 --> 11:39.740
Don't you watch television?

11:40.240 --> 11:43.009
As my worker, did you just call me "Jae Hui"?

11:43.509 --> 11:44.610
You must be crazy.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.679
Then what should I call you?

11:47.480 --> 11:49.210
You can call me "Ms. Ahn"!

11:49.710 --> 11:51.450
You're too old to be a Miss.

11:51.549 --> 11:52.620
Hey!

11:53.450 --> 11:55.049
If you don't want to be kicked out, shut up!

11:55.889 --> 11:57.720
Okay, I'll shut up.

11:58.919 --> 11:59.960
Do you want food?

12:05.500 --> 12:06.559
He told me...

12:07.000 --> 12:10.039
that you paid him to hurt Bok Ja.

12:10.700 --> 12:11.740
That's nonsense.

12:12.769 --> 12:13.840
Let's meet that man right away.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.870
No, report him to the police.

12:16.409 --> 12:17.509
I'll lock him up in jail.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.309
Are you doubting me too?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.679
Truth be told, you have the motive.

12:25.950 --> 12:27.419
You hated her a lot.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.259
If I were going to instigate such a thing using a middleman,

12:31.559 --> 12:33.389
I would have told him to kill her instead.

12:35.529 --> 12:37.730
Report him to the police, okay? You better do it.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.399
Never mind. I'll do it.

12:40.730 --> 12:41.970
What are you going to report him for?

12:42.169 --> 12:43.600
And what if you do?

12:44.039 --> 12:47.639
If he accuses you of instigating it, will you have a way out?

12:47.809 --> 12:50.639
Why would I need a way out of something I didn't do?

12:50.809 --> 12:53.549
And if I paid him to do that, there would be a receipt...

12:53.649 --> 12:54.679
or a transaction record.

12:54.779 --> 12:56.750
He said you used cash so no record would remain.

12:56.950 --> 12:57.950
What?

12:58.750 --> 13:00.250
I want to see this man myself.

13:00.649 --> 13:01.690
No.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.049
Report him.

13:03.990 --> 13:07.830
No good will come out of having the police at your house.

13:08.090 --> 13:09.730
You shouldn't report this to the police, Ju Mi.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.830
I have a feeling that this was her doing.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.200
I couldn't even eat properly...

13:17.870 --> 13:19.169
ever since she entered our home.

13:21.669 --> 13:23.240
What are you going to do about Jae Gu?

13:23.440 --> 13:25.909
What could I do? We've been strangers for a long time now.

13:26.179 --> 13:27.580
Let him come back home for the time being.

13:27.779 --> 13:30.419
I'm not the one stopping him. He dug his own grave.

13:30.980 --> 13:34.190
I'm disgusted. He's the one who put me in this misery.

13:34.350 --> 13:36.960
I'll call him, so keep that in mind.

13:37.419 --> 13:38.720
What are you going to say?

13:38.889 --> 13:40.559
I should tell him to come back home.

13:41.190 --> 13:43.799
I'll let you take care of that yourself.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.970
But, he can't enter my room.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.070
Oh, sure. I got it.

13:51.570 --> 13:53.470
I cleaned out the room on the second floor for him.

14:30.779 --> 14:31.840
Hello?

14:33.009 --> 14:35.450
A Jin. What is it?

14:36.879 --> 14:38.620
Of course, I want to go back home.

14:40.090 --> 14:42.049
Okay, I'm hanging up now, Jae Gu.

14:47.090 --> 14:49.159
Oh. One moment, please.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.100
A Jin, they said that the trainer quit a few days ago.

14:55.370 --> 14:57.639
- Text me his number. - Okay, A Jin.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.409
She eats six meals a day...

15:01.009 --> 15:02.710
and finishes a large pizza by herself.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.210
My point is,

15:04.509 --> 15:06.480
I don't see my wife as a woman, but an elephant.

15:06.679 --> 15:07.980
I don't feel sexually attracted to her.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.179
Have you ever thought of looking into...

15:13.889 --> 15:16.250
why your wife goes on a binge?

15:17.490 --> 15:19.620
Your wife isn't there just to satisfy your sexual appetite.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.759
As a fellow man, you're not understanding me.

15:22.690 --> 15:25.759
If it were you, would you sleep with an elephant-sized woman?

15:31.970 --> 15:33.240
Yes, I got it.

15:37.110 --> 15:40.779
You are Mr. Kang's partner who called earlier, aren't you?

15:40.879 --> 15:41.879
Yes.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.720
He's in the middle of a consultation.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.049
I feel so frustrated.

15:46.690 --> 15:49.389
- Are you leaving? - I told him that...

15:49.590 --> 15:51.889
I'll pay him big money if he helps me win the divorce lawsuit.

15:53.059 --> 15:54.289
And he says, "Love your wife"?

15:54.960 --> 15:57.029
He needs to go out of business to come to his senses.

15:58.330 --> 16:01.830
Mr. Kang sometimes goes overboard with his clients.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.470
He talks as if he's Confucius day in and day out.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.610
I notarized your father's prenuptial agreement.

16:08.909 --> 16:09.909
Keep it safe.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.009
Thank you.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.710
- Would you like some tea? - No.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.210
I asked your office manager about your schedule before coming here.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.049
She said you have to be in court at 3 o'clock.

16:19.350 --> 16:20.389
That's too bad.

16:23.389 --> 16:24.620
But, partner.

16:25.490 --> 16:26.889
You seem to be in a good mood today.

16:28.230 --> 16:29.259
Really?

16:35.830 --> 16:36.840
(Love or Hurt Makes Me Bloom)

16:36.940 --> 16:38.639
There was a charity event.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.970
This was a precious donation from Ms. Baek,

16:42.139 --> 16:44.009
but no one bought it.

16:44.740 --> 16:47.679
This book of poetry was the only item that remained...

16:47.950 --> 16:51.019
as if it was a single flower in the middle of a battlefield.

16:51.620 --> 16:54.850
It seemed like fate. I was strangely drawn to it.

16:56.690 --> 16:57.759
You're not saying...

16:57.960 --> 17:01.360
you're giving this to me, are you?

17:01.889 --> 17:04.430
I am. I'm thankful to you in many ways.

17:10.970 --> 17:15.240
"Endure the rest of your life with this love."

17:15.670 --> 17:18.079
I really liked that passage too.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.180
The art is amazing too.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.618
Why are you giving me this precious book?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.348
You're my partner.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.549
Please read that and comfort me.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.920
I wanted to give you a priceless gift.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.859
I'll do that. Thank you.

17:38.829 --> 17:40.529
I'll get going. Please continue what you were doing.

17:41.069 --> 17:42.069
Wait, A Jin.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.369
"If the sun shines through the clouds,"

17:47.640 --> 17:49.869
"that sun becomes one with you."

17:53.750 --> 17:55.650
That's another line from this book of poetry.

17:59.220 --> 18:02.720
"If the sun shines through the clouds,

18:03.049 --> 18:05.259
that sun becomes one with you."

18:07.130 --> 18:08.160
I like that.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.460
Maybe I should have kept that book.

18:23.339 --> 18:24.880
What brings you here, madam?

18:30.019 --> 18:32.950
My daughter-in-law said she put in a word for me.

18:33.450 --> 18:35.019
What's your daughter-in-law's name?

18:36.619 --> 18:38.190
Woo A Jin.

18:40.390 --> 18:41.630
Yes, madam.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.829
Your admission procedure has been completed.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.430
You may enter right away if you'd like.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.039
Thank you.

18:51.599 --> 18:52.769
But, madam.

18:53.670 --> 18:56.410
You were a frequent guest at our hotel in the past, right?

18:57.309 --> 18:59.210
- Pardon? - It's just that...

18:59.480 --> 19:01.549
- I feel like I've met you before. - No.

19:03.619 --> 19:04.680
This...

19:05.480 --> 19:06.920
is my first time here.

19:16.930 --> 19:18.930
I've definitely seen her many times before.

19:20.029 --> 19:21.200
Where have I seen her?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.309
Then, is he not answering at all?

20:01.369 --> 20:02.970
It says the number doesn't exist.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.640
This is weird.

20:06.339 --> 20:09.450
A Jin, do you think Ju Mi told him to do it or...

20:09.779 --> 20:10.849
I don't know.

20:11.619 --> 20:13.789
Maybe I should have talked to my partner about this.

20:13.950 --> 20:15.519
- Your partner? - Yes.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.460
The partner who helps me with mind counseling.

20:19.690 --> 20:21.990
A Jin, Ji Hu's violin teacher said...

20:22.089 --> 20:25.059
she'd call you about entering her in a competition.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.970
Is my daughter talented at playing the violin too?

20:28.369 --> 20:29.630
I know, right?

20:29.930 --> 20:31.470
What will we do with her?

20:31.569 --> 20:32.970
Let's look for something she's not good at.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.109
A Jin, are things okay with Jae Seok?

20:42.009 --> 20:43.279
How could it be okay?

20:43.950 --> 20:45.279
It's hard to even look at his face.

20:46.220 --> 20:47.519
I'm only enduring it because of Ji Hu.

20:48.349 --> 20:51.460
I endure it for Ji Hu by thinking about the things he's done...

20:53.019 --> 20:55.359
that I was thankful for...

20:56.589 --> 20:57.829
five times a day.

20:59.660 --> 21:01.170
Is he working right now?

21:02.670 --> 21:03.670
Probably?

22:09.230 --> 22:12.140
Seong Hui.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.210
What?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.279
Who is right then?

22:19.009 --> 22:21.410
Jae Hui, what are you talking about?

22:22.250 --> 22:24.720
Am I crazy enough to make him do such a crazy thing?

22:24.819 --> 22:26.150
I don't even know him very well.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.920
He disappeared though.

22:28.019 --> 22:29.589
Weren't you the one who told him to do that too?

22:29.690 --> 22:31.789
- Jae Hui! - That's okay. I understand you.

22:31.890 --> 22:34.130
- I said it wasn't me! - Is Jae Gu coming home?

22:34.230 --> 22:35.589
Yes, he's on his way.

22:35.690 --> 22:37.230
That's good. We have to unite.

22:38.259 --> 22:41.170
They really get on my nerves.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.200
What should we do, madam?

22:44.940 --> 22:46.299
Get rid of them one by one.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.980
You can start with that childish wench over there.

22:51.410 --> 22:52.410
What are you doing?

22:55.250 --> 22:57.019
- It's nothing. - Please get some rest.

23:00.150 --> 23:02.750
I don't know where this woman rolled in from,

23:03.359 --> 23:05.720
but her body reeks of cigarettes.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.190
What will A Jin do?

23:08.859 --> 23:10.799
I'm pretty sure she wants to die as it is.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.630
Why? Did something happen to her?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.240
- I know about it too. - What is it?

23:17.339 --> 23:18.700
Why are you leaving me out?

23:23.229 --> 23:25.860
Mr. Chairman, why don't you clear out a room,

23:25.959 --> 23:28.169
put a karaoke machine in there...

23:28.570 --> 23:30.340
and install...

23:30.570 --> 23:32.040
What is it called?

23:32.239 --> 23:35.409
A home theatre? Install that too.

23:35.739 --> 23:39.379
All the rich people on television live like that.

23:40.550 --> 23:41.709
Is that what you wanted to do?

23:42.550 --> 23:45.919
Gosh, I'm just thinking of you.

23:46.020 --> 23:50.020
Your heart needs to be healthy for your body to be healthy too.

23:56.330 --> 23:57.429
Why are you so late?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.030
I was just working.

24:02.629 --> 24:03.669
I'm telling the truth.

24:03.739 --> 24:05.070
Come here and sit down for a moment.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.610
Okay.

24:12.610 --> 24:15.850
I'll half-heartedly tolerate you and live with no expectations.

24:16.879 --> 24:18.719
I'm going to endure it for Ji Hu's sake.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.149
This is for Ji Hu.

24:20.889 --> 24:21.989
I'm thankful for that.

24:22.189 --> 24:23.919
In return, you must leave and come home on time...

24:24.090 --> 24:26.120
and I'm going to track your phone.

24:26.459 --> 24:27.459
Are you the NIS?

24:27.459 --> 24:29.959
Don't joke around with me! I don't want to hear it!

24:30.459 --> 24:33.300
And from now on, sleep in the guest room.

24:33.399 --> 24:35.500
A normal couple lifestyle is impossible for us now.

24:36.899 --> 24:38.840
If you're going to kick me out, kick me out of the house.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.169
The maid already cleaned it up for you,

24:42.909 --> 24:43.979
so go to bed.

24:44.139 --> 24:45.179
Okay.

25:49.209 --> 25:50.239
You're so lame.

25:50.439 --> 25:52.179
Why are you texting me in the same house?

25:52.540 --> 25:53.580
It's fun.

25:53.679 --> 25:56.649
Jeong Hyeon texts me from her room from time to time.

26:04.159 --> 26:05.389
Make me a cup of rice punch.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.229
Are you saying you've never met this person before?

26:14.169 --> 26:15.229
Yes.

26:15.399 --> 26:18.040
You know that your wife was assaulted by the same person, right?

26:20.100 --> 26:21.110
Didn't you know?

26:22.070 --> 26:24.139
You saw the injuries on her face and body, right?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.080
Is...

26:26.080 --> 26:27.379
Is that what she said?

26:27.879 --> 26:28.979
That it was the same culprit?

26:29.149 --> 26:30.850
Yes, that's what she thinks.

26:31.149 --> 26:32.550
His features and clothes were similar too.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.500
Get out.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.729
- What? - I told you to get out.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.399
I'm going to make your room into a karaoke and movie room.

26:54.239 --> 26:55.939
- What? - Chairman Ahn.

26:56.540 --> 26:59.810
People usually call that a multiplex room.

26:59.909 --> 27:02.850
- Really? - Dad, I'm going to live here.

27:02.949 --> 27:04.379
Why would you live here?

27:04.879 --> 27:08.520
I already bought you a house and a farm on Jeju Island for you!

27:08.620 --> 27:10.489
I told you my husband blew all of it.

27:11.159 --> 27:13.060
If I go to Jeju Island, I have to work as a diver.

27:13.159 --> 27:14.229
Then be a diver!

27:15.530 --> 27:18.260
Why are you doing this to me? Why just me?

27:18.360 --> 27:19.560
Try to be a decent human being!

27:19.899 --> 27:20.929
What's wrong with being a diver?

27:21.899 --> 27:23.330
What about the pickled vegetables?

27:23.639 --> 27:26.169
I'm going to pick it up from Pungsuk's Kitchen today.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.239
Try this for now. Pepper leaves.

27:32.840 --> 27:36.550
Then when should we start remodeling the guest room?

27:36.649 --> 27:39.080
Excuse me, what are you doing?

27:39.320 --> 27:42.719
Jae Hui, you're old enough now.

27:43.419 --> 27:44.689
Don't throw a tantrum.

27:45.919 --> 27:47.129
What did you say?

27:50.159 --> 27:51.199
What are you doing?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.699
I've prepared Jae Gu's breakfast.

27:55.270 --> 27:56.270
Leave it!

27:56.570 --> 27:58.169
Why are you preparing his breakfast?

27:58.270 --> 27:59.570
Then who will?

28:00.639 --> 28:02.939
Isn't this what I'm here to do?

28:06.639 --> 28:09.250
Who on earth is the owner of this house?

28:09.350 --> 28:11.620
Your son can't eat at the table and your daughter is getting kicked out!

28:12.179 --> 28:14.689
Dad, this doesn't make any sense.

28:14.790 --> 28:16.989
Does your head hurt by any chance?

28:18.020 --> 28:20.189
I wouldn't be doing this if I had decent children!

28:20.389 --> 28:23.360
The reason I'm sick is all because of you!

28:23.560 --> 28:25.260
Listen to you.

28:25.360 --> 28:29.169
If my headaches turn into dementia, will you be happy?

28:31.370 --> 28:34.469
You're getting worked up again. I told you not to do that.

28:35.969 --> 28:37.040
Jae Hui.

28:37.610 --> 28:42.050
I'd like it if you could refrain from saying such provocative things.

28:42.709 --> 28:45.949
I'm begging you.

28:55.129 --> 28:56.290
It's time to eat.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.100
Don't bother me.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.699
You should eat something.

29:35.169 --> 29:38.070
Jae Hui, can't you switch rooms with Jae Gu?

29:39.239 --> 29:42.340
Take the room on the second floor and let Jae Gu sleep here.

29:42.969 --> 29:44.040
Ju Mi.

29:44.610 --> 29:47.379
Didn't you clearly hear what Dad said to us this morning?

29:48.379 --> 29:51.320
He told me to empty this room so he can do something else with it!

29:52.179 --> 29:53.949
Right, he said that.

29:54.050 --> 29:56.250
How can I get rid of that woman?

29:56.719 --> 30:00.629
Should I scrub the bathroom floor with soap so she'll slip and die?

30:10.030 --> 30:12.969
Your glucose level has significantly dropped.

30:16.209 --> 30:17.310
I'm so happy.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.750
- I'm so happy. - It's all thanks to you, Ms. Park.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.679
But when will you stop calling me "Ms. Park"?

30:28.050 --> 30:29.090
I know, right?

30:29.590 --> 30:30.659
Then...

30:34.129 --> 30:35.189
My love.

30:37.429 --> 30:38.459
Yes.

30:39.899 --> 30:40.969
Honey.

30:52.239 --> 30:54.709
Change Chairman Ahn's blankets with this one.

30:55.010 --> 30:57.580
And use this as the bedspread.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.959
Get rid of those plates.

31:07.689 --> 31:10.530
The late madam used to use those plates...

31:10.629 --> 31:13.600
so Ms. Woo purposely stored them on the top shelf.

31:13.699 --> 31:17.469
I didn't tell you to throw them away. Just push them to the back.

31:18.439 --> 31:21.469
Don't talk back and just do as you're told.

31:24.479 --> 31:25.540
By the way.

31:27.709 --> 31:30.350
Bang Soon is going to come to Pungsuk's Kitchen from now on.

31:30.449 --> 31:32.219
Take her with you just for today.

31:32.649 --> 31:35.489
And go pick up the Korean ramp pickles I ordered last time.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.620
Yes, madam.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.600
Who is she?

31:45.729 --> 31:47.300
The new maid. The crazy one.

31:49.929 --> 31:51.300
Here's your Korean ramp pickle.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.040
Yes.

31:55.709 --> 31:57.610
May I take a look around?

32:00.110 --> 32:01.179
Sure.

33:23.530 --> 33:25.899
The tarts were really sweet.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.300
Just like your dimples.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.169
I want you to fill my dimples.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.870
Mr. Yun changed the morning soccer game to bike-riding.

33:34.070 --> 33:35.469
Oh my, how did that happen?

33:35.570 --> 33:39.310
I will never forget this morning. I'll love you even more tomorrow.

33:39.510 --> 33:41.449
I love you too.

33:47.489 --> 33:49.590
Seong Hui.

33:50.659 --> 33:52.560
Seong Hui.

33:53.959 --> 33:55.860
Seong Hui.

33:57.429 --> 33:58.459
Our...

33:58.899 --> 34:00.770
Our Seong Hui.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.339
Our Seong Hui.

34:12.679 --> 34:15.049
(Name, Birthday, Permanent Address, Residence, Profession)

34:15.650 --> 34:17.679
Mother's death anniversary and our family members' birthdays.

34:18.020 --> 34:21.250
And our family takes care of our uncle's death anniversary as well.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.159
There's a Buddhist temple that Father built for our family.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.190
We hold our ancestral rites there.

34:26.659 --> 34:27.929
Mother's ancestral rites too.

34:28.190 --> 34:30.659
You should take care of this from now on.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.199
I will.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.299
Thank you for cooperating with me.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.670
I might be overstepping my boundaries,

34:38.500 --> 34:40.100
but I have a favor to ask you.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.609
- Go ahead. - Un Gyu is a senior in high school.

34:45.109 --> 34:46.179
I know that.

34:46.179 --> 34:49.250
He's introverted and doesn't talk much, so he doesn't show it,

34:49.650 --> 34:50.779
but he's very hurt.

34:51.319 --> 34:53.380
He misses and resents his father.

34:53.589 --> 34:56.290
He doesn't show any of his emotions.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.359
Please apologize to Un Gyu...

35:00.429 --> 35:02.060
for the mistake you made in the past.

35:02.889 --> 35:04.159
If that's difficult,

35:05.400 --> 35:07.529
please say a few warm words to him at least.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.569
I'll do that.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.870
You're quite...

35:16.370 --> 35:17.679
different...

35:18.679 --> 35:19.739
from other people.

35:28.020 --> 35:29.250
I beg you.

35:29.850 --> 35:31.889
Take care of Father and our family.

35:38.199 --> 35:40.429
That's right. Slowly.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.830
Slowly.

35:42.900 --> 35:46.239
Chairman Ahn, will you be able to go for your exercise treatment today?

35:46.739 --> 35:49.639
No, I just got back from the hospital.

35:50.139 --> 35:51.440
I'm tired so I want to rest today.

35:52.509 --> 35:53.580
Okay.

35:53.750 --> 35:56.880
Then, can I borrow your car today?

35:57.580 --> 36:00.750
I want to go grocery shopping so I can make you some food.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.520
You can use it whenever you want.

36:03.489 --> 36:05.489
Actually, just buy yourself a car.

36:07.089 --> 36:09.730
Can I do that?

36:10.029 --> 36:11.100
Of course.

36:11.199 --> 36:13.100
Buy yourself a sturdy one.

36:20.310 --> 36:21.639
Where are you headed, Ms. Park?

36:22.339 --> 36:24.909
Take me to the fish market, Mr. Kim.

36:25.279 --> 36:26.339
Sure.

36:48.330 --> 36:50.299
Are you busy? You're in a rush.

36:50.940 --> 36:54.139
Don't follow Mun Tak around anymore. No more secret cameras either.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.179
Why? You said you needed it to get divorced.

36:58.279 --> 37:02.350
All of Gangnam knows that he's living together with that wench.

37:02.449 --> 37:03.480
It's fine.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.179
I don't think I should be asking you to do this.

37:06.889 --> 37:09.190
It's fun. I'm fine with it.

37:09.790 --> 37:10.920
Do you want me to buy you a car?

37:11.620 --> 37:12.960
Give me cash instead.

37:13.630 --> 37:14.659
Okay.

37:15.429 --> 37:18.000
About your friends I met on the yacht...

37:18.630 --> 37:21.000
One of them is dating my friend.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.270
- What? Who? - Are you curious?

37:24.370 --> 37:25.639
- Are you serious? - Yes.

37:26.909 --> 37:28.339
Did they sleep together?

38:02.639 --> 38:03.779
Scalpel 15.

38:22.529 --> 38:24.730
Lift your chin. That's good.

38:28.130 --> 38:32.339
(Recent calls)

38:36.040 --> 38:38.040
(Dr. Jang: Let's go for a drink sometime.)

38:38.239 --> 38:40.040
(Jong Gyu: I haven't had so much fun in a while.)

38:40.250 --> 38:41.779
(Min Su: How about a joint business in Songdo?)

38:45.549 --> 38:47.350
(Wife: I enjoyed the rice punch, honey.)

38:50.620 --> 38:52.690
(Ms. Lee: Your wife just dropped by your office.)

38:52.859 --> 38:54.560
Dr. Jang, are you at the hotel right now?

38:55.029 --> 38:56.759
I feel anxious, Dr. Jang.

39:05.270 --> 39:07.409
Was it you all along?

39:08.109 --> 39:09.839
What are you doing right now?

39:11.580 --> 39:13.210
Ms. Cha, why are you acting this way?

39:13.339 --> 39:14.580
It wasn't Ms. Lee.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.549
What?

39:24.219 --> 39:26.889
I'm going to have a child.

39:28.889 --> 39:29.889
Are you looking for eel?

39:37.400 --> 39:40.000
The eel smells delicious.

39:40.969 --> 39:44.139
- Doesn't it? - Did you go out just to buy this?

39:45.310 --> 39:46.339
Yes.

39:46.779 --> 39:49.009
There's a difference between freshwater eel and sea eel.

39:49.549 --> 39:51.449
- Would you like to try some? - Okay.

39:56.859 --> 39:58.520
It's hot. Open wide.

40:01.989 --> 40:03.060
This is delicious!

40:03.699 --> 40:04.960
- Isn't it? - Yes.

40:05.330 --> 40:06.730
- Try another bite. - Okay.

40:08.170 --> 40:09.230
Wrap it up like this.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.540
Oh my, you eat so well.

40:15.710 --> 40:16.909
- Isn't it delicious? - It is.

40:17.509 --> 40:21.449
So, you're saying Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn aren't on good terms?

40:21.549 --> 40:23.250
They treat each other like strangers.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.150
By the way, you're close with Ms. Park, aren't you?

40:28.920 --> 40:30.190
How do you know each other?

40:31.089 --> 40:33.159
What are you so curious about?

40:33.259 --> 40:35.489
What kind of food does Ms. Park like?

40:35.659 --> 40:37.560
Since when do you call her "Ms. Park"?

40:39.400 --> 40:40.429
The truth is,

40:40.500 --> 40:42.230
I know this family's situation better than anyone.

40:42.870 --> 40:45.600
If Ms. Park ever needs my help,

40:46.040 --> 40:48.440
I'm always willing to offer it.

40:50.069 --> 40:51.279
Goodness.

40:54.380 --> 40:55.509
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

40:55.609 --> 40:57.380
I lost my mind after reading that text.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.279
So...

41:00.850 --> 41:02.250
He does have a woman, doesn't he?

41:02.889 --> 41:04.359
I don't know anything about that.

41:04.589 --> 41:05.819
Why are you being like that?

41:06.020 --> 41:07.560
The text message pretty much looked that way.

41:07.759 --> 41:09.330
You asked if he was at a hotel.

41:09.989 --> 41:12.460
Dr. Jang sleeps at a hotel from time to time.

41:12.799 --> 41:15.500
He's very tired after performing multiple surgeries in a row...

41:15.670 --> 41:16.900
on Chinese patients.

41:19.370 --> 41:22.540
I may be working for the money Dr. Jang pays me,

41:22.810 --> 41:25.409
but I don't want to continue working under such rude treatment.

41:26.139 --> 41:27.750
I intend to resign tomorrow.

41:30.719 --> 41:32.949
What did you take me for?

41:33.750 --> 41:35.520
I'm sorry, but...

41:36.250 --> 41:38.020
Do you really know nothing about him having an affair?

41:38.219 --> 41:40.359
I don't know. How would I know that?

41:40.560 --> 41:43.290
And even if I knew, I only do work-related tasks.

41:43.389 --> 41:45.859
I don't meddle in other people's family affairs.

41:46.529 --> 41:48.469
You're a woman too. Do you really have to be like this?

41:49.799 --> 41:51.100
Dr. Jang finished his surgery.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.980
Here.

42:02.350 --> 42:04.480
Chairman Ahn, let's stop here.

42:04.679 --> 42:05.750
Okay.

42:15.290 --> 42:17.330
- Chairman Ahn. - Yes?

42:17.429 --> 42:20.929
You know how A Jin is doing all the housekeeping...

42:21.400 --> 42:23.500
in our household.

42:23.639 --> 42:24.670
That's right.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.370
Can I do that instead?

42:29.739 --> 42:31.980
If there was no lady of the house, it'd be different,

42:32.080 --> 42:34.710
but I'm technically your wife, after all.

42:35.179 --> 42:36.750
Why go through all that trouble?

42:37.179 --> 42:39.520
I give you my cards and money anyway.

42:39.719 --> 42:42.889
Gosh, I'm not saying I want to spend money however I want.

42:43.219 --> 42:45.190
This isn't about money.

42:45.290 --> 42:47.359
If that's not it, leave it to A Jin.

42:47.929 --> 42:50.029
She's been doing it for years.

42:50.759 --> 42:53.830
She does a really meticulous and economic job.

42:54.130 --> 42:58.500
She even separates personal expenses from business expenses.

42:59.100 --> 43:00.170
She's smart.

43:03.170 --> 43:04.339
Okay.

43:15.850 --> 43:17.889
Ma'am, would you like a Native American...

43:17.989 --> 43:19.690
or a Pippi hairstyle?

43:19.790 --> 43:21.929
Oh my, how do you know the Pippi hairstyle?

43:22.489 --> 43:24.259
I'm a little old-fashioned.

43:24.359 --> 43:27.330
Oh my, you really are. May I ask your age?

43:27.429 --> 43:28.469
I'm 10 years old.

43:28.500 --> 43:32.199
Oh my, you look young for your age. You look like you're nine.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.469
You look really young for your age too.

43:35.639 --> 43:37.080
Really? Thank you.

43:37.710 --> 43:39.739
I'll do a skin test to make you pretty.

43:39.839 --> 43:40.850
Okay.

43:43.520 --> 43:44.819
(Way Skin)

43:45.779 --> 43:47.489
(Basic Skin Test)

43:52.259 --> 43:54.460
Oh my, am I getting prettier?

43:54.560 --> 43:55.589
Yes, you are.

43:57.100 --> 43:58.299
Here are your results.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.670
(Very Moist, 92%)

44:00.929 --> 44:02.799
How should I pay?

44:03.469 --> 44:05.770
Since you're pretty, you don't have to pay.

44:06.170 --> 44:09.069
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

44:12.739 --> 44:15.750
It's time for our princess to cut her nails.

44:15.750 --> 44:18.420
- I'm going to do it. - I'll do it for you.

44:18.420 --> 44:21.049
That's okay. You've been getting texts this whole time.

44:21.049 --> 44:22.190
- You should read them. - Okay.

44:24.989 --> 44:26.120
Who is it?

44:26.120 --> 44:28.859
- It's my partner. - Do you have a partner too?

44:28.859 --> 44:29.960
I do.

44:30.900 --> 44:33.500
Don't fight with your partner and be friendly with each other, okay?

44:33.500 --> 44:34.929
Will do.

44:36.699 --> 44:37.799
(Partner)

44:38.639 --> 44:41.569
"It rained that day so we could meet..."

44:42.009 --> 44:44.810
"and the man from the third floor scratched my car."

44:46.040 --> 44:49.779
"They were all miracles that occurred so we could meet."

44:50.279 --> 44:51.850
"But I didn't know that."

44:52.520 --> 44:55.150
Isn't this paragraph captivating?

45:09.600 --> 45:10.670
A Jin.

45:10.670 --> 45:14.069
Ms. Baek, is there a way I can get my hands on another copy...

45:14.239 --> 45:16.310
of the book of poetry you donated?

45:16.339 --> 45:17.480
Why?

45:18.009 --> 45:20.949
I gave that book to Mr. Kang as a gift...

45:21.109 --> 45:22.449
Who did you give it to?

45:22.810 --> 45:24.150
Mr. Kang.

45:26.719 --> 45:27.719
No way.

45:27.949 --> 45:30.659
(Love or Hurt Makes Me Bloom)

45:34.929 --> 45:38.130
That's Mr. Kang's book of poetry.

45:38.130 --> 45:39.659
He writes poetry.

45:39.730 --> 45:41.929
His pen name is Kang Tae Rim.

45:52.810 --> 45:54.350
How could you do that to me?

45:56.549 --> 45:57.580
I'm passing through...

45:58.420 --> 46:01.319
your area right now.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.889
Would you like to come out for a moment?

46:04.420 --> 46:07.230
They won't sell so I have around 100 copies.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.560
Are you happy you made me into a fool?

46:11.659 --> 46:13.600
How did I make you into a fool?

46:13.799 --> 46:16.000
You should have been surprised and said,

46:16.299 --> 46:17.969
"This is my book of poetry"

46:18.739 --> 46:20.210
when I gave it to you.

46:20.909 --> 46:22.139
Then I wouldn't have looked cool.

46:24.940 --> 46:26.009
Let me see it for a second.

46:33.250 --> 46:34.650
(Kang Tae Rim)

46:36.250 --> 46:39.219
See? Isn't this dramatic?

46:40.489 --> 46:42.529
The poet signed the book himself.

46:43.190 --> 46:44.359
You should be honored.

46:45.799 --> 46:48.000
Yes, I'm very honored.

46:48.230 --> 46:50.500
Why do I have to be the one who's embarrassed...

46:50.699 --> 46:52.699
when you're praising yourself?

46:54.040 --> 46:55.210
Have you had dinner yet?

46:55.609 --> 46:56.940
Yes, have you?

46:57.810 --> 46:59.940
If you haven't eaten, I haven't eaten either.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.650
If you have, I have too.

47:02.310 --> 47:03.480
That's what dinner is all about.

47:05.779 --> 47:07.620
If you flip to page 35,

47:07.790 --> 47:09.350
there's a poem called "Three Meals a Day".

47:09.719 --> 47:10.859
Read it when you get home.

47:12.420 --> 47:15.190
Don't be too moved after reading my book of poetry.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.540
I'm very sorry, Ms. Lee.

47:42.589 --> 47:45.120
Take a vacation for a few days.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.630
Here.

48:14.790 --> 48:16.319
I think my wife caught on.

48:16.589 --> 48:18.359
Let's not see each other for the time being.

48:31.940 --> 48:33.270
Did you do it?

48:35.609 --> 48:38.009
- Why do you think that? - Just because.

48:38.839 --> 48:40.380
This thought came to mind.

48:40.609 --> 48:41.609
"Who could have been..."

48:42.049 --> 48:45.179
"the person who wanted to hit me so badly?"

48:48.520 --> 48:49.920
I guess...

48:50.319 --> 48:53.529
you don't treat anyone else as recklessly as you treat me.

48:54.330 --> 48:56.130
I'm going to find out who did this...

48:56.389 --> 48:57.929
and give them a taste of their own medicine...

48:58.460 --> 49:00.400
or lock them up in jail.

49:00.699 --> 49:01.730
You should.

49:02.429 --> 49:03.870
You shouldn't let anyone hit you.

49:04.870 --> 49:06.100
Give it a try.

49:06.100 --> 49:07.540
Is something up with you these days?

49:08.310 --> 49:09.370
Or are you crazy?

49:10.179 --> 49:11.339
Don't mess with me...

49:11.540 --> 49:13.580
unless you want to be stripped naked and kicked out.

49:59.790 --> 50:02.190
You seem excited after getting remarried.

50:02.759 --> 50:05.060
That woman came to this house and she knew exactly what she was doing.

50:08.230 --> 50:09.400
Father.

50:10.239 --> 50:11.770
You shouldn't do this to me.

50:14.270 --> 50:15.339
I...

50:17.210 --> 50:20.350
feel wronged about many things,

50:22.549 --> 50:25.819
but I've held it in because of my late mom.

50:27.089 --> 50:31.920
I didn't hire a guy to follow you to take over your company...

50:31.989 --> 50:33.089
Shut your mouth!

50:33.989 --> 50:36.859
How dare you? You killed a man!

50:37.659 --> 50:40.060
I wasn't the one who killed him!

50:40.770 --> 50:42.900
It was an accident! How many times have I told you?

50:43.799 --> 50:45.339
What reason did I have to do that?

50:46.739 --> 50:50.609
What reason did I have to hit your secretary with my car?

50:50.609 --> 50:53.810
Then why did you incite the directors to make me step down...

50:54.009 --> 50:56.779
from the management line at the board meeting?

50:57.219 --> 50:58.449
Was that a misunderstanding too?

50:59.080 --> 51:01.589
You dirty bastard. I can't call you my son!

51:01.790 --> 51:03.020
That too...

51:03.960 --> 51:05.620
was a plot.

51:06.159 --> 51:09.759
Why do you trust your directors over your own child?

51:10.089 --> 51:13.630
- Shut up! - You treat me like an insect!

51:13.630 --> 51:14.770
You scum!

51:17.040 --> 51:18.069
Chairman Ahn!

51:20.739 --> 51:22.940
Don't you think I know your ulterior motive?

51:23.639 --> 51:26.980
You're just a nobody who easily made it into this family.

51:43.359 --> 51:44.359
You better...

51:45.029 --> 51:46.060
watch your mouth.

51:46.969 --> 51:48.000
What?

51:50.940 --> 51:53.299
Your wife and kid.

51:53.810 --> 51:57.310
If you want them to be treated like human beings...

51:57.310 --> 51:58.609
in this household,

51:59.380 --> 52:00.880
you better keep your mouth shut.

52:03.109 --> 52:05.219
Are you crazy?

52:05.420 --> 52:06.480
I'm...

52:07.089 --> 52:09.420
the lady of this household.

52:10.049 --> 52:12.589
I told you last time too that I'm your father's wife.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.389
I told you to watch your mouth.

52:15.259 --> 52:18.359
Why are you making me repeat myself?

52:20.130 --> 52:22.299
If you spew that kind of nonsense once more,

52:23.940 --> 52:26.969
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

52:28.770 --> 52:30.480
This is your last warning.

52:41.750 --> 52:42.790
Stop it.

52:50.759 --> 52:52.359
Are you feeling better?

52:52.799 --> 52:53.830
I'm fine.

52:55.170 --> 52:57.639
Don't think about anything and just go to sleep.

52:58.699 --> 53:00.310
He's not my child, but my enemy.

53:01.739 --> 53:03.509
That's why we should give birth to a good kid...

53:03.509 --> 53:06.210
who won't be our enemy.

53:17.359 --> 53:19.989
I don't have any power,

53:19.989 --> 53:23.029
so all your kids look down on me.

53:24.460 --> 53:25.460
I'm sorry.

53:28.270 --> 53:29.330
Where are you going?

53:30.339 --> 53:32.000
Go to bed without me.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.770
I'm going to wait until you come back.

53:35.710 --> 53:38.440
There's no need for that. I'm not in the mood.

53:39.310 --> 53:41.350
Hey, don't be like that.

53:42.109 --> 53:43.620
Go to bed.

54:19.449 --> 54:22.020
"If you're having a hard time, eat."

54:22.650 --> 54:24.020
"Then you'll regain your strength."

54:24.690 --> 54:26.190
"Eat all three meals."

54:28.159 --> 54:29.929
"Then you'll burst with energy."

54:30.500 --> 54:32.259
"Live with the strength food gives you."

54:32.960 --> 54:33.969
What is this?

54:35.170 --> 54:36.270
How is this a poem?

54:42.370 --> 54:45.109
Ju Mi, why aren't you sleeping?

54:46.440 --> 54:48.909
What is this? Have you made up?

54:50.109 --> 54:52.150
Is a married couple having a fling? What is this?

54:52.150 --> 54:53.489
It's not like that, Jae Hui.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.850
Why don't you come in? Don't just stand there.

54:55.850 --> 54:56.889
That's okay.

55:00.759 --> 55:02.190
What are you going to do with Ju Mi?

55:02.429 --> 55:04.730
What else? We just have to live like this.

55:05.060 --> 55:06.600
You're really hopeless.

55:06.929 --> 55:08.230
Are you going to stay in America?

55:08.230 --> 55:09.299
What else can I do?

55:09.830 --> 55:11.370
If I keep sticking around,

55:11.540 --> 55:13.739
that accident could come back to haunt me.

55:14.540 --> 55:16.710
Damn it. I'm out of money too.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.750
52 percent of the company's stocks belong to Father.

55:22.710 --> 55:25.250
- What about Jae Seok? - I think he owns around 10 percent.

55:25.449 --> 55:27.089
He received it with a certification of merit last time.

55:34.790 --> 55:36.029
I have no interest in the company.

55:36.460 --> 55:38.230
I already made a promise with the old man too.

55:38.799 --> 55:40.799
I promised to keep my hands off of the company's shares.

55:41.469 --> 55:44.139
Then what is it that you want exactly?

55:45.440 --> 55:47.509
- Cash. - What?

55:47.509 --> 55:50.179
I have an unbelievable business idea.

55:52.009 --> 55:54.650
I guess this is why Dad hates us.

55:55.810 --> 55:59.480
Don't associate me with you. I'm different from you.

55:59.480 --> 56:00.889
I'm tired. Go downstairs.

56:11.659 --> 56:13.029
I want to call you.

56:15.870 --> 56:18.600
(Seong Hui: I want to call you.)

56:26.109 --> 56:27.179
Are we...

56:27.509 --> 56:29.380
really going to end it here?

56:31.179 --> 56:33.380
Don't we love each other?

56:34.489 --> 56:37.219
Our love hasn't ended yet.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.719
I thought of you...

56:40.659 --> 56:42.489
so I made potato pancakes.

56:43.560 --> 56:45.699
But I don't want to eat this by myself.

57:11.060 --> 57:13.120
Okay, get in!

57:15.489 --> 57:17.330
Okay, here we go.

58:10.819 --> 58:13.279
(Caregiver)

58:15.889 --> 58:17.889
- Hello? - A Jin?

58:18.089 --> 58:19.790
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

58:20.259 --> 58:23.659
Can you come by with Jae Seok before he goes to work?

58:24.429 --> 58:25.759
Okay, I will.

59:09.969 --> 59:10.980
Ahn Jae Seok!

59:12.380 --> 59:13.409
Ahn Jae Seok!

59:14.449 --> 59:15.449
Stop right there!

59:22.290 --> 59:24.790
I told you to stop! Stop!

59:45.810 --> 59:48.009
(The Lady in Dignity)

59:48.794 --> 59:51.120
I beg you. Please don't take away her father...

59:51.620 --> 59:53.179
from Ji Hu.

59:53.350 --> 59:54.420
Please.

59:55.650 --> 59:56.650
Are you pregnant?

59:56.989 --> 59:59.319
From now on, you take care of all the family affairs.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.230
All of this is for your own good.

01:00:02.489 --> 01:00:04.859
- You. - How dare you call me like that?

01:00:05.659 --> 01:00:06.730
Leave, now.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.069
I don't think I can break up with her.

01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:10.569
Go out and die!

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:13.909
I'll do what you can't, A Jin.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:17.040
- Did you have an affair with him? - Who...

01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:20.080
How dare you mess around with a man who has a daughter and a wife?

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:23.179
I know who is backing you up,

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.679
but if you flirt with my husband again,

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.920
I'll kill you.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.049
I'm too scared to go back to that house.

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:31.319
I'll buy you a new house.

01:00:31.389 --> 01:00:34.659
A Jin bought it for me, but the house is under my name.

01:00:34.659 --> 01:00:36.029
What do you think you are doing?

01:00:36.389 --> 01:00:38.130
How dare you kick me out?

01:00:38.159 --> 01:00:39.230
Shoot me.

01:00:39.429 --> 01:00:42.429
If you don't shoot me here, you'll look ridiculous.

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:44.839
Shoot me!

01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:07.289
