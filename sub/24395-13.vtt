WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.742
Delaine has kidnapped
Eric Beaumont's daughter.

00:03.786 --> 00:05.570
When am I getting out of here?

00:05.614 --> 00:06.745
Evie.

00:06.789 --> 00:07.964
Please don't fear me, Evie.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.139
I just want to help you.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.314
Delaine brainwashed

00:10.358 --> 00:11.465
Victoria Locke
for over a decade.

00:11.489 --> 00:12.664
You are safe, Victoria.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.057
No one's gonna hurt you here.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.625
Damien got inside my head.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.193
Do you know who
your father is? I know he's a good man,

00:19.236 --> 00:21.108
and you're not.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.240
Still Daddy's good little girl.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.981
Eric said
Delaine's a game player.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.852
What if the game isn't over?

00:27.636 --> 00:28.811
He wanted to destroy Eric.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.073
He won't stop trying.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.205
He'll be watching us.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.293
All of us.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:43.782 --> 00:47.090
Wow. Not so bad?

00:47.134 --> 00:49.136
It is sublime.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.789
Sublime? Wow.

00:50.833 --> 00:54.402
Those, literature courses
are really paying off.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.447
Hey. Mom, Dad.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.236
Okay.

01:02.279 --> 01:05.108
Beautiful.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.850
Thank you
for letting us join you

01:07.893 --> 01:09.156
on your business trip.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.983
You know,
I just have the one meeting.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.769
We could, take
a boat cruise this evening.

01:13.812 --> 01:17.120
Yeah. Yeah? Okay.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.122
Even if we're divorcing,
it's still important

01:19.166 --> 01:20.993
for her to feel we're a family.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.300
Her therapist says
she's making progress.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.782
The anxiety is subsiding.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.915
They say
you choose your parents.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.221
So our daughter's a masochist.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.442
Probably. Yeah.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.404
All right, so this is Semaphore.

01:40.448 --> 01:44.016
Home of the hottest
digital currency.

01:44.060 --> 01:47.150
It's crushing Bitcoin, and it
only had its ICO six months ago.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.892
Aren't digital currencies
all smoke and mirrors?

01:49.935 --> 01:53.069
A lot of folks would argue
that about the U.S. dollar.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.332
So, what's the gig?

01:55.376 --> 01:56.962
Semaphore is interested
in moving into China,

01:56.986 --> 01:58.727
and they need us
to help negotiate a deal.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.120
Someone is pumped about this.

02:00.163 --> 02:03.166
CriRes expanding into new
arenas of negotiation?

02:03.210 --> 02:05.516
You bet I am. And we're meeting with?

02:05.560 --> 02:07.431
Well, up until now,
the founder of Semaphore

02:07.475 --> 02:09.433
has remained anonymous.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.870
So, we don't know who we're
negotiating on behalf of

02:11.914 --> 02:13.655
for a product
that doesn't exist.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.527
It's a great first gig
in this new arena.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.486
I'm going to have
a quick shower,

02:18.529 --> 02:21.228
and then we'll go
and do some exploring.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.186
Okay. Okay?

02:40.377 --> 02:43.859
Welcome. Welcome.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.862
So, this is the famous
Cri/Res team.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.125
These tech titans get
younger and younger.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.213
No, no, no.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.216
I'm like the front man,
the pretty face.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.784
No, he's the creator,

02:55.827 --> 02:59.527
founder and CEO
of Semaphore Digital.

03:05.402 --> 03:09.014
Allow me to introduce...

03:09.058 --> 03:11.147
Damien Delaine? DELAINE: Zara Hallam.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.193
How nice of you to remember.
Hello, Eric.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.846
Zara, lock the door.Eric.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.259
The only way Delaine gets off
this roof is over that ledge.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.285
Go ahead, Ms. Hallam.
Lock the door.

03:18.328 --> 03:21.113
It'll be a pleasure to see Eric
give in to his limbic impulses.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.289
We all know he wants to.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.508
It's got to be some
kind of trap. Don't.

03:24.552 --> 03:28.251
And honestly, Eric, you want
to hear what I have to say.

03:28.295 --> 03:32.124
Really, you do.
So, please. Shall we?

03:46.095 --> 03:48.445
For me? Thank you.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.414
You're the creator of Semaphore?

04:00.457 --> 04:04.113
I am indeed, Mr. Yates.
Call it a lifelong passion.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.680
What's this about, Damien?

04:05.723 --> 04:07.899
Exactly what my people told
Ms. Walker.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.727
I just want
the Chinese government

04:09.771 --> 04:11.642
to adopt my digital currency.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.253
You're gonna make it happen.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.429
We will never negotiate for you.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.082
You misunderstand me, Eric.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.910
I don't want you
to negotiate for me.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.564
I want you to kidnap someone.

04:24.699 --> 04:27.354
And here's why
you're gonna do it for me.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.099
Evie.

04:36.841 --> 04:40.323
Okay, Eric, it won't work.
You won't be able to reach her.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.065
I... I guess, I control her.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.501
Very crudely put,

04:44.545 --> 04:46.416
I've brainwashed her.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.158
But it's so much more
sophisticated than that.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.855
The point is,

04:50.899 --> 04:52.292
if you don't do what I ask,

04:52.335 --> 04:54.294
our little girl
becomes a killer.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.388
Are you ready? Yeah, Mom.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.566
Let's go, then. Let's go.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.122
It's like this... record.

05:40.165 --> 05:43.473
I can't get him out of my head.
It's just there.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.214
He's always there.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.478
Damien Delaine?

05:48.522 --> 05:52.047
Maybe you need to go down
the rabbit hole with him.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.266
Find out where it goes.

05:54.310 --> 05:58.096
We often run from things
that scare us,

05:58.140 --> 05:59.639
but actually
we should confront them...

05:59.663 --> 06:01.099
Who knew

06:01.143 --> 06:03.232
that her therapist
had a little...

06:03.275 --> 06:05.843
drug and debt problem?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.367
I was only too happy
to help out.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.281
Of course, for a little
favor in return.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.327
You remember these
little beauties?

06:11.371 --> 06:14.112
The antidepressants
you thought were helping her?

06:14.156 --> 06:17.855
It's actually scopolamine,
which made her more pliable.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.814
Open yourself up to the fears.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.598
Even if I hurt someone?

06:21.642 --> 06:24.384
People get hurt. We know this.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.516
We can't let that stop us.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.172
People aren't robots.

06:30.215 --> 06:33.044
You can't just make them
mindlessly obey.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.481
Perhaps.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.744
But you remember Jessica Ford
and Victoria Locke?

06:36.787 --> 06:39.050
The things I made them do.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.618
God, look at that view.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.664
Isn't it sublime?

06:45.492 --> 06:47.537
What do you want us
to do, Damien?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.887
Brava, Ms. Hallam.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.977
Is she the only negotiator
in this room?

06:53.021 --> 06:55.589
This is Xiao Wei-Shing,

06:55.632 --> 06:58.069
Governor of the
People's Bank of China.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.462
He's the only thing

06:59.506 --> 07:01.377
that stands in the way
of the Central Bank

07:01.421 --> 07:05.163
making a sizeable purchase of
Semaphore digital currency.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.688
Turns out, he's not

07:07.731 --> 07:10.734
a fan of digital currencies.

07:10.778 --> 07:13.824
Now, normally, I...
I like Luddites.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.870
Love them.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.587
But not when they get
in the way of my plan.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.700
Jaden Chin.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.484
The governor's wife.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.573
You expect us to kidnap her?

07:23.617 --> 07:26.489
Well, it shouldn't be very hard.

07:26.533 --> 07:30.188
I mean, Eric's handled, what,
a-a thousand kidnappings?

07:30.232 --> 07:33.931
He's the world's
foremost expert, yeah?

07:33.975 --> 07:37.152
The governor and Jaden
are in Budapest.

07:37.195 --> 07:40.895
You kidnap the governor's wife,
you threaten to kill her...

07:40.938 --> 07:43.724
unless he authorizes
the purchase

07:43.767 --> 07:47.597
of $100 billion
of Semaphore Digital.

07:47.641 --> 07:50.557
You get him to comply,

07:50.600 --> 07:53.298
I call off your daughter.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.040
And she never
hears from me again,

07:56.084 --> 07:58.782
ever.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.218
We won't play your game.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.745
I can feel him in my head.

08:04.788 --> 08:07.835
It's, like,
these horrible things.

08:07.878 --> 08:11.882
It's like his thoughts
are my thoughts.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.191
I have left a trail of crumbs

08:16.234 --> 08:18.106
for Evie to follow
to her target.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.804
She'll reach said
person in a few hours.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.458
Now, I'm watching.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.112
If you don't bring your A game,

08:24.155 --> 08:26.288
or if you call the police,

08:26.331 --> 08:28.986
I'll just accelerate
the timeline.

08:29.030 --> 08:33.207
You know I'm good to my word.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.818
That's it.

08:34.861 --> 08:36.732
Is everyone on board?

08:36.777 --> 08:38.082
Great. Charles.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.086
You can't brainwash
someone to kill.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.741
Like he said, Victoria Locke,
Jessica Ford, what about them?

08:44.785 --> 08:47.048
It is possible to gain a
profound influence over someone

08:47.091 --> 08:48.658
if you have intimate
access to them.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.268
Which he had,
with Evie's therapist.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.314
W-What did you see
in those video clips?

08:52.357 --> 08:53.987
There's a condition called
learned helplessness.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.317
Tell me.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.624
A person can be made
to feel dependent on someone,

08:57.667 --> 08:59.190
even if they're
dangerous to them.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.758
Sorry, man.
Evie's showing signs.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.083
Eric, you're not
seriously thinking

09:03.107 --> 09:04.631
of kidnapping this woman?

09:04.674 --> 09:06.260
Listen, the one thing we know
for certain about Delaine

09:06.284 --> 09:08.286
Eric, we played

09:08.330 --> 09:10.308
his game last time, and it was
rigged from the start.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.507
This one will be, too.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.770
He's watching.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.511
All right, Zara,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.339
you go after Evie.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.949
She and Nathalie were
going sightseeing.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.865
Maybe we can stop her before
Delaine leaves his next crumb.

09:21.909 --> 09:25.739
Check the hotel room
for any clues.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.044
Thank you.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.796
Cut! That's it!

09:39.840 --> 09:43.191
Jaden Chin, 31.
Up-and-coming film actress.

09:43.234 --> 09:46.760
Married to Xiao Wei-Shing, 44,

09:46.803 --> 09:48.370
two years ago.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.634
He is friends with
the president of China,

09:51.678 --> 09:53.767
part of the inner circle
that controls the country.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.658
And he's visiting his wife
while she's shooting a movie.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.944
That's a devoted husband.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.449
Pardon me. Pardon me, sir.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.843
May I take one of those?
Thank you so much. Yeah.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.236
Here. Follow my lead.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.542
Ms.-Ms. Chin.
Sorry to interrupt.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.590
You speak Chinese?

10:34.634 --> 10:35.872
Embarrassingly little, actually.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.462
I'm sorry, would you,
would you mind?

10:37.506 --> 10:39.702
My daughter's a massive fan, and
I think she'd be awfully cross

10:39.726 --> 10:42.685
if I didn't get an autograph. An English
girl who likes films from China?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.687
She is just mad about them.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.210
Would you,
would you mind terribly?

10:46.254 --> 10:47.603
Of course not.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.735
Perfect. Thank you so much.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.998
Thank you. You're welcome.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.782
Call sheet.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.262
Should have her
advance schedule.

10:55.785 --> 10:59.354
Look, our job is to
save people from kidnappers.

10:59.397 --> 11:02.400
Becoming ones could have
a serious reputational impact.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.838
I'll go for loss of reputation
over the loss of my daughter.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.970
If Zara finds Evie,
I don't have to do this.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.711
If I do, it is a risk
I will take alone.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.993
I don't want
the two of you involved.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.888
No, no, I took this job
knowing full well

11:11.932 --> 11:13.281
what I was getting into.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.978
I'm not cutting and running now.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.763
Zara.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.765
I checked the search history
on Evie's laptop.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.463
She was looking for churches
with catacombs.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.900
Catacombs? What's that about?

11:23.944 --> 11:25.467
Anything else?

11:25.510 --> 11:27.730
I found a sleeve
of sleeping pills

11:27.774 --> 11:29.732
completely emptied out.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.215
There's a thermal bath nearby.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.217
Maybe we should get a massage?

11:36.260 --> 11:39.089
I want to go to
St. Martin's Cathedral.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.222
It's, like, really super old,

11:41.265 --> 11:44.660
and the guide book says its
catacombs are a must-see.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.575
A church over a spa?

11:46.618 --> 11:48.882
What have you done
with Evie Beaumont?

11:48.925 --> 11:51.145
Come on. Catacombs.

11:51.188 --> 11:54.888
Catacombs... or a seaweed wrap?

11:54.931 --> 11:57.107
Mom.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.762
Okay. Catacombs it is.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.419
Well, it's a long walk.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.203
Got to stay hydrated.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.683
Okay.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.210
It's beautiful.

12:20.435 --> 12:23.351
I need to sit down.
Something's wrong.

12:23.394 --> 12:26.049
I don't know.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.399
I just feel weak.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.010
It's okay, Mom. I'm right here.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.362
I can't keep my eyes open.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.581
I'll take care of you.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.198
So, she's got
an appointment with a trainer,

12:44.241 --> 12:47.027
then hits the spa,
followed by a media interview

12:47.070 --> 12:49.638
promoting her new film. No.

12:49.681 --> 12:50.857
What is it?

12:50.900 --> 12:52.989
She's flies out for Beijing
this afternoon.

12:53.033 --> 12:56.645
Okay, so either we do this now
or we don't do it at all.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.955
What?

13:01.998 --> 13:04.784
Ever been on television?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.717
Your mother?

13:28.024 --> 13:30.026
Very good, Evie.

13:30.070 --> 13:34.291
I know it must have been hard,
but it was for the best.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.424
Did I do okay?

13:36.467 --> 13:40.297
You're doing just fine,
just fine...

13:40.341 --> 13:41.908
my little Evie.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.301
What's my next instruction?

14:08.673 --> 14:10.414
Okay. Keep me posted.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.416
Zara's trying to find
the church they went to.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.027
We all set? Yeah, listen.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.768
Eric, if we pull this off,

14:16.812 --> 14:20.511
we could be making Delaine
the richest person, like, ever.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.359
Imagine that psychopath
with that kind of money.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.906
Delaine's never
cared about money.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.536
He's after something
else, something bigger.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.084
Okay, fine. What?

14:28.128 --> 14:29.477
Hi, Ms. Chin.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.914
Hi. Angie Morgan,

14:31.958 --> 14:33.370
I'm sorry, there's been
a last-minute room change

14:33.394 --> 14:34.351
for your interview.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.397
It's right this way, please.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.361
I'm just gonna get you miked up.

14:44.405 --> 14:45.754
Okay. Good.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.103
Thank you.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.279
Ms. Chin, it is such a
thrill to have you here

14:49.323 --> 14:51.455
in lovely Budapest,
I mean, especially with

14:51.499 --> 14:52.761
your new film shooting.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.173
I'm sorry, guys,
you can't be in here.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.416
It just messes with the sound.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.201
But we do have a monitor
right here

14:58.245 --> 15:00.682
where you can watch her,
and there's some water for you.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.123
Okay. Okay, we good?

15:07.167 --> 15:08.385
Rolling.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.171
Okay. So as I understand it,

15:11.214 --> 15:13.260
the sequel to your film
Weeping Lotus Flower

15:13.303 --> 15:15.044
is set to come out next summer.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.916
I mean, you must be so excited.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.570
So much. It has been
such a long time,

15:19.614 --> 15:21.529
and the fans have
been so patient,

15:21.572 --> 15:22.834
so, yeah, I am.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.836
I heard that you worked out

15:24.880 --> 15:26.795
continuously for three
months on this film.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.580
So, have you had an opportunity

15:29.624 --> 15:32.192
to get out in Budapest,
see some of the sights?

15:32.235 --> 15:34.281
The architecture is gorgeous.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.955
Who knew you could rent
your very own safe house?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.347
Only 20 Gs a night.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.345
Nathalie?

16:41.739 --> 16:43.741
Evie?

16:50.444 --> 16:52.881
My God.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.931
Nathalie. Nathalie.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.324
Nathalie. Nathalie.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.719
Okay, come on.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.200
Come on. Let's go.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.550
I got you. Come on, let's go.

17:11.551 --> 17:13.380
Okay, now, let me...
I'll just... I'll do...

17:14.771 --> 17:17.210
Okay. Um...

17:17.252 --> 17:18.863
Jaden? Just...

17:18.906 --> 17:20.473
Just roll with it, okay? Okay.

17:20.517 --> 17:21.431
There you go.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.563
Okay.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.391
Carpet works well in here.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.827
Listen, we are not
gonna harm you.

17:25.869 --> 17:28.134
This will all be over soon.
We're not what you think.

17:28.176 --> 17:29.483
Okay, let's get you up.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.750
Have a seat.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.099
You'll be okay.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.231
Zara found Nathalie.

17:38.274 --> 17:41.712
Evie drugged her.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.150
She drugged her mother? Yeah.
And disappeared.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.152
I'm gonna take the gag off.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.153
No. No.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.851
Not yet. Oliver?

17:54.377 --> 17:56.814
It's okay.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.644
Contact.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.129
Hello?

18:07.173 --> 18:08.130
Xiao Wei-Shing?

18:08.174 --> 18:09.349
Yes.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.046
We have your wife.

18:12.656 --> 18:15.094
Ask for proof of life.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.704
I need proof that she's alive.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.801
Don't you dare hurt her.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.019
What do you want?

18:28.063 --> 18:29.934
I want to see you do
exactly what I say.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.111
I've texted you a location.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.287
Meet me there in one hour.
No police,

18:34.330 --> 18:36.158
or bad things will happen.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.904
Really?

18:42.947 --> 18:44.862
"Bad things will happen"?

18:44.906 --> 18:46.125
I am winging it here.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.170
Listen, Jaden, I'm
going to untie you now.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.651
Please believe me, we are
being forced to do this

18:50.694 --> 18:51.565
to prevent a murder.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.306
We're not gonna harm you.

18:53.349 --> 18:56.047
We'll get you back
to your husband very soon.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.007
Thank you. Thank you.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.922
Thank you. You saved me.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.663
Thank you so much.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.631
You know what to do, Evie.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.156
Just put on the dress
like a good girl.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.506
Make yourself presentable.

19:19.549 --> 19:20.942
Go to the address.

19:20.985 --> 19:24.206
You'll be directed
to your target.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.992
I don't know who you are
and what you want from me,

19:28.036 --> 19:31.039
but anything is better than
staying with him.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.564
Unless...

19:36.392 --> 19:39.874
Is this some game of his?
Did he put you up to this?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.789
Your husband? No, no, no.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.225
No, I-I told you,

19:43.269 --> 19:46.097
we just had to do this
to save a life.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.970
I-I'm like a prisoner.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.015
I can't go anywhere,
and I can't escape.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.930
And he just got worse and worse.

19:52.974 --> 19:56.586
And nobody knows.
He said he would kill me.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.460
You have to help me.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.811
Okay. Just give me
a moment. Okay?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.642
For the love of God.

20:08.685 --> 20:11.558
She would rather be kidnapped
than be with her husband.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.037
Imagine how bad
that's got to be.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.430
We can't send her back.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.345
I can't let Evie
become a killer.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.521
I don't like this
any more than you do.

20:18.565 --> 20:19.870
What other choice do we have?

20:19.914 --> 20:22.873
We can do this.
We can save them both.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.615
We will find a way.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.574
I've been working on
who Evie's target may be.

20:27.617 --> 20:30.664
I think I may have
hit on something.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.581
Victor Volynets.

20:34.624 --> 20:35.451
Who's that?

20:35.495 --> 20:37.148
An oligarch

20:37.192 --> 20:39.499
Damien forced Eric to
steal $100 million from.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.780
He's been hunting Damien
since the theft,

20:40.804 --> 20:42.806
and he just arrived
here in Budapest.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.460
He's throwing a party
at the Wolf Den,

20:44.504 --> 20:46.419
his floating club on the Danube.

20:46.462 --> 20:47.942
And check this out.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.597
A $200,000 reward
for Damien's whereabouts.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.642
Well, that ain't chump change.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.620
If Damien's after Volynets,
it would be just like him

20:54.644 --> 20:56.733
to kill two birds
with one stone.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.474
The dude is nothing
if not efficient.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.259
Okay, well, if that's
his plan, though,

21:00.302 --> 21:02.304
how does Semaphore fit into it?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.088
Good question.

21:04.132 --> 21:05.307
Go into our archives,

21:05.351 --> 21:07.111
pull up all the data
that we have on Delaine.

21:07.135 --> 21:10.225
Maybe there's a clue in there
as to what he's really after.

21:14.055 --> 21:16.187
I can't believe
this is happening.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.928
Delaine again?

21:17.972 --> 21:21.236
Evie drugged me.
What's he done to her?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.892
It could be the same game he
started when he kidnapped her.

21:24.935 --> 21:28.069
But he's always five steps
ahead, so who knows?

21:30.158 --> 21:31.377
What is it?

21:31.420 --> 21:33.988
Eric thinks Victor Volynets
is Evie's target.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.381
Volynets?

21:35.424 --> 21:37.034
Oliver just sent me
his coordinates.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.906
If we can get to him
before she does,

21:38.949 --> 21:40.864
we can stop her
from killing him.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.344
Come on.

21:49.656 --> 21:50.918
Here we go.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.181
So negotiator us
doesn't carry guns.

21:53.224 --> 21:56.358
Does that apply to kidnapper us?

21:56.402 --> 21:58.360
Take that as a yes.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.329
Who the hell are those guys?

22:11.895 --> 22:14.376
Where's my wife?

22:14.420 --> 22:17.988
We call the shots.
Get your laptop.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.562
Log into your account

22:26.606 --> 22:28.216
at the People's Bank of China.

22:35.049 --> 22:38.095
Now authorize your bank
to purchase $100 billion

22:38.139 --> 22:40.533
worth of the digital
currency Semaphore.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.186
I can't.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.145
Cryptocurrencies are not secure.

22:44.188 --> 22:47.409
They can easily be hacked,
wiped out at a moment's notice.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.716
My government would never agree.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.979
Latency, pitch. He's lying.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.114
You do it,

22:57.158 --> 23:00.857
or I'll put a bullet
in Jaden's pretty little head.

23:08.517 --> 23:11.999
Go ahead. Kill her.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.899
Evie.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.466
Well, look at you, all grown up.

23:44.510 --> 23:45.772
Who are you?

23:45.815 --> 23:47.774
Delaine sent me.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.385
Why don't you come with me.

23:54.737 --> 23:57.566
Damien says you're
quite the protégé.

23:57.610 --> 24:00.743
He doesn't say that
about everyone, trust me.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.484
There he is.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.486
Victor Volynets.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.836
You know what to do.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.938
Later tonight, yeah?

24:21.982 --> 24:23.984
We need to speak in private.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.509
About what?

24:27.553 --> 24:30.991
I have a message
from Damien Delaine.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.521
I don't get it.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.175
Oliver, she's sleeping.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.524
We had him, and then suddenly

24:42.568 --> 24:44.570
he tells us to go ahead
and kill her?

24:44.613 --> 24:48.661
Everything about Xiao says
he wants his wife back. So why?

24:48.704 --> 24:50.880
Those two men,
they were negotiators.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.882
When I made the threat
to kill Jaden,

24:52.926 --> 24:54.536
they knew it wasn't sincere.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.060
So you were profiled?

24:57.104 --> 25:01.064
Damn. It's like
we got beaten by us.

25:02.892 --> 25:05.852
Delaine. Go ahead.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.462
I need an update.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.247
I was pleased to hear
Jaden missed her flight.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.466
Xiao won't make the purchase.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.207
He doesn't believe
that we'll kill her.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.557
Well, make him believe.
Chop off a finger or an ear.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.211
Isn't that what kidnappers do?

25:17.254 --> 25:19.126
I see.

25:19.169 --> 25:23.173
Well, maybe you need
a reminder of the stakes.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.567
I'd hurry up. Rumor has it,

25:25.611 --> 25:28.744
Mr. Volynets has a thing
for very young ladies.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.399
Damien, even if you get
everything you want from this,

25:31.442 --> 25:33.183
and even if you call off Evie,

25:33.227 --> 25:36.099
I want you to know
that I am coming for you.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.101
Call it my lifelong passion.

25:38.145 --> 25:40.582
Yeah. Not convincing, Eric.

25:40.626 --> 25:44.064
You just don't have the singular
commitment to a cause like I do.

25:44.107 --> 25:47.110
You'd be a far more
effective man if you did.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.385
So Delaine sends a young girl
to deliver his messages.

26:01.429 --> 26:04.867
Can't say I mind.

26:06.695 --> 26:10.177
Not that it'll
change the outcome.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.484
Would you like a drink? No, thank you.

26:36.507 --> 26:39.293
I won't report you.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.774
This is from Mr. Delaine.

26:41.817 --> 26:44.690
It's a digital wallet
with $200 million worth

26:44.733 --> 26:46.256
of Semaphore currency,

26:46.300 --> 26:49.912
the $100 million
that he stole from you,

26:49.956 --> 26:52.567
plus another hundred
for your troubles.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.743
No hard feelings.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.745
My only feeling is that he pays.

26:56.789 --> 27:00.140
Tell Mr. Delaine his
payment is accepted.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.316
Well...

27:02.359 --> 27:04.057
What?

27:04.100 --> 27:07.408
I know you've been hunting him,
so I want everything you have.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.410
All surveillance records.

27:13.588 --> 27:16.635
You're a very brave girl.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.309
Zara.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.572
We talked to Volynets.
We just missed Evie.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.009
He's alive?

27:43.052 --> 27:44.682
Yeah, and so he couldn't
have been the target,

27:44.706 --> 27:45.838
but Evie was here.

27:45.881 --> 27:49.450
If Volynets isn't the
target, then who is?

27:49.493 --> 27:52.583
Eric, I think we should
call the police.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.324
Damien would have
planned for that.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.631
He'd make Evie pay
even more than she is now.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.111
So what, then? I don't know.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.768
Just stand by.

28:05.727 --> 28:09.470
Eric, we can't continue
to hold Jaden.

28:09.513 --> 28:12.473
You're absolutely right.

28:12.516 --> 28:13.885
We should give her back
to the governor.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.782
Well, I agree that
we can't keep her, but...

28:16.825 --> 28:18.087
good-bye leverage.

28:18.131 --> 28:22.222
I'm not going back. I'm not.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.920
Jaden, you're free to go.
You can walk out the front door.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.444
You know your husband is never
gonna stop looking for you.

28:27.488 --> 28:28.768
Then how can I
get away from him?

28:28.794 --> 28:30.404
Help us save my daughter.

28:30.447 --> 28:33.276
And I promise you, he will never
lay another finger on you again.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.191
We can both get what we want.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.411
Just hear me out.

29:26.895 --> 29:29.332
We're in. The Trojan's loaded.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.378
She did it.

29:31.421 --> 29:32.771
You did it.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.424
My God, if he catches her
doing this...

29:53.400 --> 29:54.749
He's doing it.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.422
He's changing his password
to protect his account,

29:56.446 --> 29:59.623
and now...

30:00.929 --> 30:02.409
We have it.

30:02.452 --> 30:04.367
Delaine.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.021
Hello, Eric.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.588
We have access to the governor's

30:07.631 --> 30:09.372
personal trading account
at the bank.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.374
You call off Evie,
we give it to you.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.985
Buy as much Semaphore
as you want.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.857
Very good, Eric.
Finally some real progress.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.859
But you give me
the account details first,

30:17.903 --> 30:21.036
I verify them,
then I call her off.

30:22.429 --> 30:23.885
Once you do that,
there's no going back.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.432
You have no idea
what he's planning,

30:25.475 --> 30:28.261
other than it's designed
to cause maximum harm.

30:28.304 --> 30:29.978
If I don't know what
he's planning, I can't stop it.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.122
Send the information please.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.441
Please.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.883
We sent it.

30:41.927 --> 30:45.191
Call off Evie.

30:45.234 --> 30:49.021
Delaine. Delaine!

30:49.064 --> 30:51.719
It's done. I've removed
the encryption from her phone.

30:51.762 --> 30:54.287
You can stop her yourself.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.724
Tracking app,
it's working again.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.944
I have her location. You
track your daughter?

30:58.987 --> 31:00.728
Long story.

31:03.339 --> 31:06.342
Voice mail. Damn it. It
could be part of his game.

31:06.386 --> 31:08.518
Call Zara and Nathalie.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.306
Eric?

31:13.349 --> 31:14.698
We have access to Evie's phone,

31:14.742 --> 31:16.222
and I tracked her location.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.200
You're closer. I'm gonna
send you the coordinates.

31:18.224 --> 31:23.316
Nathalie, get our daughter back.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.987
Jaden.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.727
He knows his account was hacked.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.385
He's talking to people
in Beijing.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.692
Something is happening

31:51.735 --> 31:53.476
in the financial markets,
something big.

31:53.520 --> 31:57.393
If he finds out I did it...

31:57.437 --> 32:00.396
Jaden, hold tight.
We're coming to get you.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.356
I'm getting her
out of there. What's your plan?

32:03.399 --> 32:06.446
Negotiation. And if that doesn't
work, good old brute force.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.582
Wow.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.497
What?

32:14.541 --> 32:18.849
"Chinese Central Bank
Bets Big on Semaphore."

32:18.893 --> 32:22.114
Delaine did it.
Semaphore's being snatched up

32:22.157 --> 32:24.986
by major banks, governments;
Everyone wants in.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.988
So that was his goal.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.164
With the purchase by China,
he's sent a market signal

32:29.208 --> 32:30.861
that Semaphore can
rival the U.S. dollar.

32:30.905 --> 32:32.448
Yeah, but like you said,
Damien doesn't care about money.

32:32.472 --> 32:33.429
So why?

32:33.473 --> 32:34.691
Jaden's husband,

32:34.735 --> 32:36.017
he said that
cryptocurrencies weren't secure.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.695
That's a minority opinion.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.499
Did you bring up all the data
that we have on Delaine?

32:40.523 --> 32:43.309
Yeah, it's right here.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.575
Wait a second, is that Delaine?

32:48.618 --> 32:50.969
Yeah. 22 years ago.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.580
He tried working with the FBI
before he realized

32:53.623 --> 32:55.408
that mass murdering
was his vocation.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.105
He pitched a profiling program

32:57.149 --> 32:58.909
that would automatically collect
and analyze personal data

32:58.933 --> 33:00.369
from the Internet.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.197
But it never happened.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.938
Feds discovered a backdoor
in the program,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.723
one that would give him access
to all that personal data.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.030
What if he's done the
same thing with Semaphore?

33:09.074 --> 33:11.032
Say there's a backdoor;
He activates it.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.513
Now he controls
every unit of Semaphore.

33:13.556 --> 33:15.689
He could wipe it all out
in one keystroke.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.039
And create a financial
crisis that makes 2008

33:18.083 --> 33:20.433
look like a picnic.
You show up at your bank,

33:20.476 --> 33:22.435
your accounts are frozen,
pensions are wiped out,

33:22.478 --> 33:24.045
mass panic ensues.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.655
Delaine claims he
wants to bring down

33:25.699 --> 33:26.981
our technologically
obsessed society.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.659
I mean, this could
actually do it.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.925
Nathalie.

33:34.969 --> 33:36.710
We're at the location you sent.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.147
Evie's not here. We found
her phone in a garbage can.

33:39.191 --> 33:40.583
There was also a gift bag,

33:40.627 --> 33:41.889
like the one at the hotel.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.108
What's in it?

33:43.151 --> 33:44.892
A hotel key card and a photo

33:44.935 --> 33:46.763
of Xiao Weo-Shing,
Jaden's husband.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.156
That's it. He's the target.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.376
Clean up loose ends.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.987
But she left it, the
picture, the key to his room.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.728
There's something else.

33:54.771 --> 33:57.600
It's a surveillance report
on Delaine's whereabouts.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.448
There. That one.
The address has been torn out.

33:59.472 --> 34:03.432
Kelenfoldi Power Station.
It says restricted access.

34:03.476 --> 34:06.218
Just the kind of place
Delaine would hide out.

34:06.261 --> 34:09.090
Evie's fighting back, she's
resisting him, breaking free.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.396
Where is she, then?

34:10.438 --> 34:11.484
She's tracking Delaine.

34:13.572 --> 34:14.704
She's gonna kill him.

34:21.014 --> 34:23.452
Trading in Semaphore
has reached 1.4 trillion.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.342
There must be a threshold before
he activates the backdoor.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.456
Enough to trigger
a financial crisis.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.762
How do we stop it?

34:28.804 --> 34:30.348
Well, we'd have to get into
his private servers,

34:30.371 --> 34:31.784
disable it there,
but we'd need a copy

34:31.808 --> 34:33.810
of the backdoor's executable
to have a shot at it.

34:33.853 --> 34:36.422
All right.
Tell me again in the car.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.472
We should split up. Yeah.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.091
Where is she?

34:53.134 --> 34:56.005
Ms. Denard, I see you
fully recovered.

34:56.050 --> 34:59.314
You're just in time to witness
something truly remarkable.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.664
Semaphore's passed 1.8 trillion,

35:01.708 --> 35:04.058
and I'm about to celebrate.
Would you like to join me?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.103
Where is she, Damien?

35:05.146 --> 35:06.582
As I promised Eric,

35:06.626 --> 35:08.758
your daughter is no longer
my concern.

35:08.802 --> 35:10.717
She's free to do whatever
she pleases.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.545
Evie, no!

35:12.588 --> 35:15.156
Leave him! No, no, no.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.810
No, no, no.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.030
Whatever he's done,
it's not worth your future.

35:20.074 --> 35:22.120
Put this gun down. Mom, get out of the way!

35:25.601 --> 35:27.125
I heard shots. That way.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.431
Find Delaine's servers.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.172
Stop the backdoor
from activating.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.826
You have Evie's phone? Yeah, here.

35:32.869 --> 35:33.914
Why?

35:35.437 --> 35:37.700
Later.
We got to find those servers.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.094
Save the world. In that order.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.138
Right.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.578
Evie, stop it. Stop it.

35:45.621 --> 35:49.234
Well, well, well, I have the...
the whole Beaumont family.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.626
Lucky me.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.193
Evie, you listen to me.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.586
Now, he spent months

35:53.629 --> 35:55.892
trying to recruit you,
like Jessica and Victoria.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.479
But I know you don't want
to end up like them.

35:57.503 --> 36:00.462
I have to. He'll never get
out of my head. I have to.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.638
For you. For all of us.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.336
But he's not in your head.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.299
All the time he thought
he was c-controlling you,

36:06.338 --> 36:08.078
you were resisting
him, fooling him.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.230
You already beat him
at his own game.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.777
You-you did it, sweetie.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.039
You did.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.092
Boy.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.355
What?

36:23.398 --> 36:24.573
Something happens when

36:24.617 --> 36:26.488
investment in Semaphore
hits two trillion.

36:26.532 --> 36:29.099
It's 95% there. What's that something?

36:29.143 --> 36:31.885
My guess?
The backdoor activates,

36:31.928 --> 36:33.408
causing an infinite split,

36:33.452 --> 36:35.212
which will make Semaphore's
value instantly worthless

36:35.236 --> 36:37.036
and start the financial
collapse Damien wants.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.240
Honey, if you kill him,

36:39.284 --> 36:41.131
he will remain in your head
for the rest of your life.

36:41.155 --> 36:44.289
You will be giving him exactly
what he wants: Martyrdom.

36:44.332 --> 36:45.899
Damien's always
dreamed about this.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.683
Your father is
a magnificent liar.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.555
I'll give him that. Shut
up, shut your mouth!

36:49.598 --> 36:51.426
You said you
needed to do that for us,

36:51.470 --> 36:53.317
but you don't need to do
anything more for us, sweetie.

36:53.341 --> 36:54.951
We're good. W-We're a family.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.866
We got one shot.

36:56.910 --> 37:00.087
Damien installed an executable
onto Evie's phone to control it.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.308
The dude is nothing
if not consistent.

37:03.351 --> 37:04.894
The DNA of the program
should be the same

37:04.918 --> 37:06.112
as the backdoor into Semaphore.

37:06.136 --> 37:07.573
I love it when you speak geek.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.096
If I can upload it
to the server,

37:09.139 --> 37:10.750
theoretically I can control it.

37:10.793 --> 37:11.968
Come on.

37:12.012 --> 37:15.015
Remember today?
Remember our walk?

37:15.058 --> 37:16.756
Come with us, baby. Come.

37:16.799 --> 37:19.585
What you need to do is just put
the gun down and we have that.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.717
Okay? Come with me.

37:21.761 --> 37:23.197
Beautiful.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.113
Just... heartfelt,

37:26.156 --> 37:28.420
beautiful speech.

37:28.463 --> 37:31.205
Very good... Come on, baby.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.076
But it changes nothing.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.557
You've already given me
what I wanted.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.168
After Semaphore,
I will be remembered

37:38.212 --> 37:40.562
for a very long time.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.526
Sit down.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.745
What is this, Eric, Abu Ghraib?

37:49.789 --> 37:53.183
I said, sit down.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.273
Oliver, it's 98%.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.276
I can't find anything
Damien might have installed.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.538
He'd disguise it somehow.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.322
No, you're right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

38:01.366 --> 38:05.761
What would
a teenager never look at?

38:05.805 --> 38:08.503
Homework, diary,
game, prom photos,

38:08.547 --> 38:10.418
math tutor app,
privacy control app...

38:10.462 --> 38:11.550
That one.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.943
You're right. That was it.

38:13.987 --> 38:16.294
So what happens now, Eric?

38:16.337 --> 38:18.078
You caught me.
It doesn't matter.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.994
My work is completed.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.952
And I am so pleased

38:22.996 --> 38:26.216
that you were the instrument
of my achievement.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.091
Perfect hero,

38:31.134 --> 38:34.529
serving me, the thing
you hate the most.

38:36.575 --> 38:38.272
I don't hate you, Damien.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.361
I pity you.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.494
You're a genius.

38:42.537 --> 38:45.888
An unusually brilliant man.

38:45.932 --> 38:48.326
I mourn for the things
you could have done.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.631
The things I havedone!

38:49.675 --> 38:53.548
Eric! The things I havedone.

38:53.592 --> 38:57.465
Really, are you
so unaware of the truth?

38:57.509 --> 39:01.643
This world has
a terrible sickness,

39:01.687 --> 39:03.341
and I can save it.

39:03.384 --> 39:06.082
For a world you say
you hate so much,

39:06.126 --> 39:09.695
you seem pretty damned obsessed
with making a mark on it.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.488
Yes.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.927
Execution failed.

39:24.971 --> 39:27.408
Infinite split canceled.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.845
What have you done, Eric?

39:29.889 --> 39:32.631
You don't have the
skill to stop it.

39:32.674 --> 39:33.675
That's true.

39:33.719 --> 39:35.503
I don't.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.897
But I know people who do.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.815
What have you done, Eric?

39:42.858 --> 39:44.686
What have you done?

39:44.730 --> 39:46.732
This was our last chance.

39:46.775 --> 39:48.821
You've condemned us all!

39:48.864 --> 39:50.257
No, Damien.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.912
Only you.

39:59.745 --> 40:02.922
You have no idea the
things I've put in motion!

40:02.965 --> 40:06.447
You think the police
will stop me? Prison?

40:22.811 --> 40:24.813
He's all yours.

40:36.825 --> 40:40.394
You're a sight for sore eyes.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.265
Looks like I missed
the main event.

40:42.309 --> 40:43.832
Not at all. You got Jaden out.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.007
How did you get Jaden out?

40:45.051 --> 40:47.053
I, tried negotiating.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.664
Then I thought to hell with it,
and I just threatened him.

40:49.708 --> 40:52.275
I like your style.Likewise.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.016
Thanks, Cyn.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.975
Hey.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.846
It's over. Let's get you home.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.718
What about him?

40:59.761 --> 41:01.110
He's not going anywhere.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.851
He'll go back to prison?

41:02.895 --> 41:05.463
He's waiting for the police
right now.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.859
Come on.

41:14.515 --> 41:17.039
Hello? Police?

41:17.083 --> 41:18.911
Help. I'm in here.

41:18.954 --> 41:21.522
I can't move. I've been shot.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.829
Well, well, well.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.875
Mr. Delaine?

41:26.919 --> 41:29.661
I never expected to get
a tip from Eric Beaumont.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.011
But it's been a
day of surprises.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.491
Indeed.

41:35.014 --> 41:38.060
I did pay you back,
and then some.

41:38.104 --> 41:40.106
Yes, I know.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.984
But now you pay a higher price.

42:02.432 --> 42:04.347
Beautiful animals.

42:10.092 --> 42:13.139
Should you see
Eric Beaumont again,

42:13.182 --> 42:15.010
please tell him

42:15.054 --> 42:17.709
I was wrong about him.

42:41.776 --> 42:44.692
You're a good man, Dad.
