03:40.595 --> 03:41.722
Look at you!

03:42.097 --> 03:44.307
How did my baby get so
grown up and beautiful?

03:44.433 --> 03:45.559
Milk.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.936
It's not even funny. You're so easy.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.896
- That's what the ladies say.
- Ew, no.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.318
Okay, Drake. So where are
those ladies tonight?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.320
Oh, baby, you are the
only girl in my life.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.049
Come on, there's got to be someone
to ring in the new year with.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.326
- Nope.
- I hate that you're alone.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.556
Don't be. Triple time is the only way
we're gonna make a move out of Freeridge.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.874
Okay. You got to stop overreacting, Dad.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.584
We don't need to move. There's a truce.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.877
Which doesn't mean shit!

04:11.960 --> 04:14.147
When the banging gets bed
enough there's always a truce.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.089
I've seen dozens. Anything can
break it, and anything will.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.860
That kid who shot your
friends is still out there.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.052
It's been a month, and so
far no sign of Latrelle.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.016
He's stupid, but not stupid
enough to come back.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.306
Babe, you don't know that.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.475
Bad news. I burned the cookies.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.558
Who's that?

04:27.809 --> 04:28.852
Monse?

04:30.896 --> 04:32.230
Shit!

04:32.981 --> 04:34.149
Shit. Shit.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.948
- I can explain.
- What is he doing in my house?

04:42.032 --> 04:44.075
- He has nowhere to go.
- He can't be there.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.428
- But, Dad...
- Don't "but Dad" me!

04:45.452 --> 04:47.204
It's too dangerous. You know that.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.287
Caesar has to go.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.706
Promise me he's leaving.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.082
- Please.
- Promise.

04:54.961 --> 04:55.961
Promise.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.109
Mi hijo?

05:19.361 --> 05:22.572
They didn't have your favorite
mole, so I got the poblano.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.449
Sounds good.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.036
I really wanted your first meal out of
the hospital to be extra special, but...

05:28.119 --> 05:29.830
I'm just thinking how crazy it is

05:29.913 --> 05:32.290
that someone's whole life
can fit inside a box.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.554
I never got to give it to her.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.225
It feels pointless to send it
to her parents now, right?

05:51.226 --> 05:53.603
Should I just keep it♪ Open it?

05:54.396 --> 05:55.814
Do what feels best.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.734
I wish I'd been to her memorial.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.780
Aah! Mi hijo, it was beautiful!

06:03.989 --> 06:06.032
You would've loved it...

06:07.200 --> 06:10.662
As much as you can love
something that's really...

06:11.580 --> 06:12.580
really sad.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.710
Look on the bright side.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.087
You finally got your own room.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.507
Too soon?

06:25.343 --> 06:26.344
I'm sorry.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.098
I'm no good with this. I
never know what to say.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.602
Life moves on.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.191
I told her I was gonna
be the love of her life.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.360
And you were.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.576
How are the preparations
coming for tonight?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.078
- Can I help?
- Let me get your pills.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.413
Ah! They aren't working.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.165
My elbow still kills.

06:57.626 --> 07:01.588
Sometimes you got to
lean on a higher power.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.267
Hold it, hold it.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.603
Now, be honest with me.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.103
What's going on?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.523
You haven't cried. It worries me.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.776
Normally, you are such a crybaby!

07:24.611 --> 07:26.529
- No, I'm not.
- Mi hijo...

07:26.696 --> 07:29.407
in this family, everyone has their thing.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.867
Mario is smart.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.578
Your father's reliable,
your mother's crazy.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.122
The twins are gross, I'm sexy,

07:36.206 --> 07:38.500
and you are the crier.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.169
Now, tell me. Why no tears?

07:42.504 --> 07:44.506
Because I still got use of my good hand.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.176
It's too soon.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.763
Too soon.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.516
People are still in mourning.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.268
It's just not the right time
to tell anyone about the cash,

07:57.352 --> 07:59.145
and maybe it'll never be the right time.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.105
Girl,

08:01.147 --> 08:02.440
why you on their side?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.776
Don't you want to get off the pole?

08:06.611 --> 08:08.530
No. No. No.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.782
I will not do that to make it up to you.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.910
Oh, come on. Please don't make me do it.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.008
Settle down, mama. Got to
get these stacks packed.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.432
Huh.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.725
What?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.019
I told you,

08:39.102 --> 08:42.105
to throw off a scent,
you got to create one.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.158
Especially one that won't entice
someone to open the bag, you feel me?

08:47.694 --> 08:48.694
All right.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.325
No. Plain sight is the smarter move.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.828
No one's gonna think anyone would
leave money out like this.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.665
And, plus, I've got eyes... everywhere.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.709
Four cameras, baby.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.006
The laundry basket in my closet?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.548
Are you kidding me?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.510
That's so obvi. Not happening.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.013
No doing. Laundry basket is basic.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.472
Jamal out.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.145
Ugh.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.025
Don't. Just don't.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.612
The pie was a good call.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.238
Ruby loves pie.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.200
Don't know why I didn't think to
get a pie in the first place.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.367
I can't go.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.203
You're going.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.206
Ruby didn't invite me. I...

09:41.414 --> 09:44.125
There's no invite. We always
spend New Year's Eve together.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.419
It's not that simple and you know it.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.297
Ruby and I haven't seen each
other or spoken since...

09:49.380 --> 09:52.801
I know, I know, but the longer you
wait, the worse it's going to get.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.928
He might not want to see me.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.347
Ruby wanted to make tonight a party.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.100
Do you really think he'd want to
party if he was in a bad place?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.935
Okay, stop worrying about Ruby.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.395
Instead, worry about where you're
gonna be sleeping tonight.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.480
I'll be home.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.689
What?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.694
- I'm gonna go see my brother.
- Are you kidding?

10:11.778 --> 10:15.115
Oscar knows this truce isn't forever.
He wouldn't want me unprotected.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.284
- He's protected me my whole life.
- Protected♪ Oscar had you DP'd.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.287
- He had to.
- He could've killed you.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.205
But he didn't.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.499
Semantics. You're not dead,
but you might as well be.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.584
- You've been put off.
- No, I've done my time.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.587
I know my brother. He wouldn't
want me sleeping on the streets.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.755
We're family.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.507
You can't go back.

10:33.883 --> 10:34.883
It's not safe.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.293
Listen, you have to stay with
me until my dad gets back.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.264
- He'll never know.
- No. You promised.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.058
Here. Take the pie to Ruby.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.478
And I'll meet you after I work it out.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.579
I don't get what the big deal is.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.164
I feel exactly the same.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.002
Do you ever miss your little adobe hut?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.838
- Qué?
- You know.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.008
The little one you used
to live in in Mexico.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.679
You think all that mud has something to do
with why your skin still looks so soft?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.894
You're good.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.604
My baby!

11:28.730 --> 11:30.857
Aren't you supposed to be
with your friends up north?

11:30.940 --> 11:33.151
There was, uh, a change of plans.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.195
I have a surprise for you.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.403
Okay. Tell us.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.574
It's, uh... it's...
it's a really big one.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.117
Okay, we're ready!

11:42.493 --> 11:44.829
It's like big-big. Like...
like life-changing.

11:44.913 --> 11:49.125
Mario! Ooh! Who's here?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.588
Ai, Mario. Stop with the theatrics!

11:53.880 --> 11:55.340
What's the surprise?

11:55.798 --> 11:56.841
Happy New Year!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.950
Did you all know there's a
pregnant white girl on your porch?

12:02.013 --> 12:04.557
Uh... surprise.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.111
I'm so sorry about your recent loss.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.905
My heart goes out to all of you.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.116
And as a beneficiary of white privilege,

12:22.200 --> 12:24.619
these kinds of tragedies
are, like, foreign to me.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.246
So on behalf of my people,

12:26.329 --> 12:28.414
I am sorry for keeping your people down.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.251
Is she for real?

12:31.334 --> 12:32.334
I hope so.

12:32.502 --> 12:36.005
Okay, um, thank you, Amber.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.217
- We... we appreciate that.
- Mama, this all looks amazing.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.387
Jamal, can you pass the bread?

12:42.470 --> 12:43.888
What bread♪ I don't have any bread.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.391
I know you don't, but can you pass it?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.941
- Why are you so jumpy?
- I'm not hiding anything.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.360
- I didn't say that you were.
- Good. Because I'm not.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.780
I'm not hiding anything hidden or found
or finding anything found or hidden.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.865
I'm living my best life, out in the open.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.034
- I have no secrets.
- I do.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.413
And I feel like I should
clear my conscience

13:08.496 --> 13:11.165
since we're about to
come into the new year,

13:11.249 --> 13:13.584
and, uh, I'm about to be
the mother to a "whitina."

13:13.835 --> 13:14.835
A what?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.379
A white Latina.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.462
Okay,

13:17.505 --> 13:19.716
so there were not a lot
of POC in my high school,

13:19.799 --> 13:22.111
which is really such a shame,
because there's a lot to learn

13:22.135 --> 13:24.387
when you just break down
those cultural barriers.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.557
Anyway, I can't believe this is
part of my personal history, but...

13:27.640 --> 13:29.892
Babe, right now is probably
not the best time...

13:29.976 --> 13:30.976
Continue.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.686
Gracias.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.983
So, I had this friend and he was Latino.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.692
Or Hispanic?

13:38.776 --> 13:39.776
Which one is he?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.554
Whatever. It doesn't matter.
It's all the same, right, babe?

13:43.031 --> 13:46.909
Anyway, we called him Ockie and I
thought it was just short for octopus,

13:46.993 --> 13:49.495
because he had an extra finger,
but it wasn't about the finger.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.623
It was because every time a teacher
took roll, he'd go, "Aquí!"

13:55.335 --> 13:57.045
The finger was just a coincidence.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.422
Is that effed-up?

14:01.132 --> 14:02.800
- Mario?
- Hmm?

14:03.051 --> 14:05.053
Can you help me in the kitchen, please?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.263
Please, don't do this.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.848
Oscar! Just...

14:10.266 --> 14:11.266
Come on!

14:12.727 --> 14:15.688
I can make it up to you and I will.
Just let me come home!

14:20.109 --> 14:21.109
Okay.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.235
Okay, fine.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.198
You want me to beg♪ I
am begging you, please!

14:25.615 --> 14:27.615
I'll do anything you want me to.
Just say the word,

14:27.658 --> 14:29.452
and I swear to God I will do it.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.878
You need to go.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.174
There's nothing I can do for you.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.510
Well, you've the choice to help me.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.012
- You messed up.
- And I'll make it right.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.306
I don't hear nothing.
You guys hear anything?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.016
- No!
- Nothing.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.602
I'm your little brother.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.978
I don't know you.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.648
But I'm your blood.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.733
You're not a Santo!

15:05.947 --> 15:07.747
Do you really want me
sleeping on the streets?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.909
As long as they're not ours.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.674
What you gonna do?

15:25.258 --> 15:28.511
I don't know, but don't worry.
I'm not dropping out of school.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.097
I'm just taking a short sabbatical
until we get on our feet...

15:32.598 --> 15:36.394
which leads me to my... next question.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.189
- Can we stay here?
- Oh hell, no!

15:40.273 --> 15:42.066
No one's living in sin under Geny's roof!

15:42.191 --> 15:43.067
What she said!

15:43.151 --> 15:44.610
So we should get married?

15:44.694 --> 15:45.778
- No!
- No!

15:45.862 --> 15:47.155
That bitch can't be my in-law!

15:47.738 --> 15:50.158
Mom, can't you just look
at the good in this?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.578
There was a death in this house,
and I'll be bringing in a life.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.665
Oh, right. It's like that old
saying, "When God closes one door",

15:57.748 --> 15:59.500
he opens the legs of a white girl."

15:59.584 --> 16:00.835
- Everything okay?
- Yes!

16:03.546 --> 16:06.382
Jasmine, this is a family matter.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.260
- So, please.
- You say that like I don't know.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.473
Jasmine, can you close your ears, honey?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.684
- Ever hear of a condom?
- Yes.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.521
It's a thin rubber sheath worn
over the penis during intercourse.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.772
Mario didn't wear one.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.691
I need water for my cotton mouth.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.862
Mom, we have nowhere to go.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.947
Amber's parents kicked her out.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.866
You got my room. I'll
bunk with the twins.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.284
- No!
- Why?

16:33.534 --> 16:34.534
Because...

16:36.120 --> 16:37.163
Because...

16:37.788 --> 16:41.542
there's scientific evidence that
Ruben's brain needs a room.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.961
A room to grow and heal.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.214
And... because I say so!

16:47.548 --> 16:48.758
Bunk.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.468
Bunk.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.385
Bunk.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.263
Does that sound weird?

16:58.226 --> 16:59.727
Mama, can I help you with anyth...

16:59.810 --> 17:00.810
I'll get that.

17:00.937 --> 17:01.979
I will get that.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.699
Miss Martinez... Mrs.
Martinez, I'm sorry, um...

17:14.407 --> 17:17.787
I... It's been a while, and I, uh...

17:22.500 --> 17:24.877
I'm really sorry about what happened.

17:25.877 --> 17:26.877
I don't...

17:27.380 --> 17:29.006
I don't really know what to say.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.843
Been really confused.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.014
I'm really scared lately. And
that's not an excuse or anything.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.516
It's the truth.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.813
I'm sorry.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.774
I'm so sorry.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.448
You don't have to apologize, Cesar.

17:56.993 --> 17:57.994
You just have to go.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.836
Ah! So tell me, what does it feel like?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.671
Like you have an alien in your belly?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.882
Actually, I don't care how it feels.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.219
I've been working this
family a long time.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.389
So don't think your little baby trap is
going to get you in tighter than me.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.766
Listen, puta.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.058
Don't come at me.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.561
I got a brick in my bag.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.274
Damn, bitch. That's my line.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.401
Game recognize game.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.465
- Is that how you say it?
- Next time, don't undercut yourself.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.656
- If you don't know it, don't show it.
- Noted.

18:37.116 --> 18:37.950
Okay.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.535
Okay, I can work with what you got.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.536
So, tell me.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.247
If you squeeze them titties hard
enough, does milk come out?

18:43.331 --> 18:44.165
I don't know.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.209
You're a gringa, so it's like soy or
almond or some good shit like that.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.295
- Good point.
- Are you gonna eat the placenta?

18:49.670 --> 18:50.713
I heard about this girl...

19:22.662 --> 19:23.662
Hold up.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.556
- Ruby?
- Hmm?

19:43.432 --> 19:46.102
We can see through your brave front.
It's okay if you're not okay.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.396
We're here for you. Just
tell us what you need.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.855
Do you need anything?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.318
Some whipped cream.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.238
I got you, bro.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.782
- I'm gonna get that whip-whip.
- Hmm.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.830
- Nice kicks!
- They were cheap! Knock-offs.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.458
And you know, it was just Christmas.
So I did real good this year.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.835
Okay.

20:11.502 --> 20:14.004
- Well, you look like a million bucks.
- Not a million.

20:14.672 --> 20:15.672
Definitely less.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.343
- I'm going in the other room now.
- Okay.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.600
- Heating up our New Year's luck?
- Hmm.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.144
This bullshit.

20:28.310 --> 20:32.231
Every year, we eat discolored greens
and black-eyed peas, and nothing.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.734
These don't bring dollars and sense.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.902
Just heartbreak and heartburn.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.111
Don't say that.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.491
Look at me. Do I look like
someone's great grandmother?

20:44.368 --> 20:46.078
- Yes?
- Exactly!

20:46.245 --> 20:49.874
That's because I can't
afford a good skin cream.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.751
This tradition is crap!

20:51.959 --> 20:53.085
Abuelita,

20:53.335 --> 20:55.880
that's all going to change.

20:56.005 --> 20:59.091
You just need to trust me and believe.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.011
I don't believe. Believing is bullshit.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.890
We are who we are, and
it's never gonna change.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.224
We're not special.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.517
Abuelita.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.269
Come here!

21:14.607 --> 21:15.733
We are special.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.736
And I can prove it.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.122
- Is this...
- Yes.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.832
- Yes?
- Yes!

21:31.916 --> 21:33.834
Jamal! You have to keep it safe!

21:34.210 --> 21:36.045
Girl, who you talking to?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.048
I got eyes on it 24/7.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.718
Everyone!

21:44.178 --> 21:45.262
It's almost midnight.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.476
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

21:50.559 --> 21:51.977
Yes, yes, yes!

21:52.436 --> 21:54.980
I wanna say something real quick
before the new year rings in.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.190
You have 30 seconds.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.149
Um.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.487
I know you're worried that I'm just
fronting and putting on a good face,

22:01.570 --> 22:03.572
but I'm not. No, I'm not a victim.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.407
- I'm a survivor.
- Yeah!

22:05.491 --> 22:08.869
And I don't want to live the rest
of my life in fear or with regret,

22:08.953 --> 22:10.079
because it's a choice.

22:10.246 --> 22:14.834
And every day we can choose to focus on
our gifts instead of our misfortunes.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.754
We can choose to... to turn our worst
tragedies into our greatest blessings

22:18.838 --> 22:20.756
and we can choose to
love instead of hate.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.859
By the way, shout-out to
whoever brought that pie.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.469
- Yes!
- Tonight, I want to look to my future

22:25.553 --> 22:26.470
and not my past.

22:26.554 --> 22:29.139
Tonight, I want to make
every second count

22:29.223 --> 22:32.101
because tonight I'm alive and okay.

22:36.772 --> 22:40.150
Nine! Eight! Seven! Six!

22:40.609 --> 22:42.194
Five! Four!

22:42.444 --> 22:44.822
Three! Two! One!

22:44.947 --> 22:46.949
Happy New Year!

22:56.292 --> 22:57.501
Ruby!

23:02.131 --> 23:03.257
My Ruby!

23:05.467 --> 23:07.595
My baby!

23:11.682 --> 23:13.684
Ruby! Ruby!

24:07.321 --> 24:08.364
I'm not okay.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.700
It should've never been you.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.375
It should've been me.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.659
I'm sorry.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.163
I'm so sorry, Ruby.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.376
I don't blame you.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.171
- You did the right thing.
- No, I didn't.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.382
I got nothing but love for you.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.011
It wasn't your fault.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.640
It wasn't your fault.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.003
Olivia...

25:48.088 --> 25:49.923
I'll never forget your kindness.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.009
Your encouragement and support.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.928
Your beautiful heart.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.893
And your unconditional friendship.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.355
You're the first and only
girlfriend I've ever had.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.609
And... until I met you,

26:09.359 --> 26:10.986
I never knew what I was missing.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.369
You should unwrap it.

26:22.956 --> 26:23.956
Yeah?

26:24.333 --> 26:25.709
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.931
What♪ What's so funny?

26:39.556 --> 26:40.808
Oh my gosh, Ruby.

26:40.891 --> 26:41.891
What?

26:42.184 --> 26:43.852
That is a terrible birthday gift.

26:44.561 --> 26:48.023
Why♪ What's so terrible about trying
to better someone's skill set?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.107
I'm with Ruby.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.610
The girl was many things,

26:51.693 --> 26:53.237
definitely not a linguist.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.448
- Yeah, she once called horchata...
- Hurache.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.699
It wasn't just once.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.285
I miss her.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.221
Guys, I've been hiding something.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.680
Me too.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.641
I've got nowhere to go.

27:23.851 --> 27:26.103
- You said that your brother was...
- No, I lied.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.564
I'm... dead to him.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.192
But not to me.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.737
I'll figure it out. I promise.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.955
Oh, right. This happened.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.623
We've been hiding this too.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.336
We don't care. We kissed you first.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.232
Anyway, as I was saying,
before you interrupted me...

27:54.256 --> 27:56.341
Hell, I've been high... all night.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.801
Are you kidding me!

27:58.844 --> 28:00.095
Are you...

28:01.763 --> 28:02.890
kidding...

28:03.390 --> 28:04.850
me?

28:05.142 --> 28:08.520
I'm literally trying to
tell you guys something!

28:08.729 --> 28:10.147
Something important!

28:10.230 --> 28:12.149
Something monumental!

28:12.232 --> 28:14.776
Something that could probably...
No, scratch that.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.987
Positively will...

28:17.446 --> 28:20.073
Positively change your lives!

28:20.407 --> 28:22.951
And you all keep interrupting me...

28:23.202 --> 28:25.662
like some dumb comedy run!

28:27.122 --> 28:29.416
What is wrong with you people?

28:29.499 --> 28:31.710
Okay! Tell us.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.299
No. I'm done.

28:37.591 --> 28:38.591
We'll shut up.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.093
You don't deserve... to know.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.429
Please.

28:47.893 --> 28:48.893
Fine.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.397
I found the RollerWorld money.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.571
You know what?

29:01.323 --> 29:03.617
I don't know why I'm being
so quick on the draw.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.702
I think an apology is in order.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.704
- For what?
- For what?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.748
For all of my mistreatment.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.960
I'm tired of being an afterthought.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.963
For once, I'd like to
be a "before-thought."

29:16.922 --> 29:18.006
Or just a thought.

29:18.966 --> 29:23.220
Not one of you has ever said you're
sorry for the shit you said to me.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.512
We're sorry.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.806
Can we see the money now?

29:25.973 --> 29:28.600
- Seriously♪ That's all you got?
- What do you want us to say?

29:29.017 --> 29:30.435
How about Jamal was right?

29:33.063 --> 29:34.982
No, you can't just move your mouths.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.233
You got to say it.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.778
"Jamal was right."

29:40.070 --> 29:44.032
Jamal is not the biggest,
fakest liar ever.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.743
"Jamal is not the biggest,
fakest liar ever."

29:46.827 --> 29:50.706
Jamal is the real glue of our crew.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.709
"Jamal is the real glue of our crew."

29:53.792 --> 29:58.297
Jamal's big mouth is not
as big as Jamal's big...

29:58.380 --> 29:59.380
I'm not gonna say that.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.049
Big intuition.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.759
Look, we get it. You're the man.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.010
Thank you.

30:05.512 --> 30:06.512
We can proceed.

30:06.888 --> 30:10.183
So now, lady and gentlemen...

30:10.809 --> 30:13.312
without further ado, I
present you with...

30:18.400 --> 30:19.693
