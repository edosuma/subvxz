00:02.523 --> 00:03.893
This violin is made of...

00:03.923 --> 00:06.653
The finest maple wood.
It was, uh... huh.

00:06.693 --> 00:08.693
Uh, it was hand carved...

00:10.393 --> 00:12.533
Would you excuse me for a sec?
Yeah.

00:12.563 --> 00:14.663
Do you guys have
to do that here?

00:14.703 --> 00:16.563
Hey, we're not complaining
that you're working.

00:16.603 --> 00:18.803
Right in the middle of our
Banjo badminton court.

00:20.503 --> 00:21.743
We'd rather be making a video,

00:21.773 --> 00:24.303
But somebody hasn't finished
writing the song yet.

00:24.343 --> 00:25.473
I'm busy working.

00:25.513 --> 00:27.343
Fine. Then we're
busy badmintoning.

00:27.383 --> 00:28.383
Game point!

00:32.783 --> 00:35.553
Would you like to pay cash for that
or should I put it on your tab?

00:35.583 --> 00:36.553
Just put it on the tab.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.493
Oh, okay.

00:40.463 --> 00:42.793
Well, I am off to the
accordion convention.

00:42.823 --> 00:46.633
And "accordion" to my watch, I
should have left an hour ago.

00:54.543 --> 00:57.443
Well, sweetie, you
are in charge.

00:57.473 --> 00:59.573
The store looks a
little crowded.

00:59.613 --> 01:01.543
- Are you sure you'll be okay?
- Actually, dad,

01:01.583 --> 01:03.683
- I probably...
- Glad to hear it. Bye-bye.

01:03.713 --> 01:06.513
Who's next? Okay, wait.
Um, here's your change.

01:06.553 --> 01:09.323
Your kazoo. Uh, the
trumpets are over there.

01:09.353 --> 01:10.723
No, this isn't the eye doctor.

01:10.753 --> 01:12.493
Oh.

01:19.493 --> 01:23.503
Guess who got a job
at the yo-yo cart?

01:23.533 --> 01:25.473
Watch this.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.673
<i>Whoo, wait. Whoo, I can do this.
Hold on.</i>

01:34.413 --> 01:37.613
It's my first day and...

01:37.653 --> 01:40.413
Probably my last.

01:42.753 --> 01:46.353
So, Ally, have you finished
writing Austin's new song?

01:46.393 --> 01:48.723
It-it's almost done. I've
just been really busy lately.

01:48.763 --> 01:51.663
I've got work,
school, book club.

01:51.693 --> 01:53.633
I have to read <i>this by tomorrow.</i>

01:55.633 --> 01:57.503
Tomorrow of what year?

01:58.703 --> 02:00.703
Well, we need a song.

02:00.743 --> 02:02.673
I can't make a video
without a song.

02:02.703 --> 02:05.513
Hey, it's not like I've been
spending all my free time.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.643
Training to eat a
20-lb hamburger.

02:07.683 --> 02:11.343
You're just jealous.

02:18.323 --> 02:20.593
Seriously, it's been a whole
month since the last video.

02:20.623 --> 02:23.693
Guys, cut Ally some slack.
A month isn't that long.

02:23.733 --> 02:25.763
It's pretty hard to
forget Austin moon.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.703
Hey, it's ralphie Hayes from
the dog food commercial!

02:28.733 --> 02:29.733
Oh my...

02:31.333 --> 02:32.533
Dog food commercial?

02:32.573 --> 02:34.703
Ally, you gotta
finish that song now!

02:36.543 --> 02:39.513
Fine. Y-you want the song? Ah!

02:39.543 --> 02:41.643
Here!

02:41.683 --> 02:44.543
See? That wasn't so hard.

02:44.583 --> 02:48.553
No way! It's the guy who won the
20-lb hamburger-eating contest.

02:50.723 --> 02:52.693
Can I have your autograph?

02:52.723 --> 02:54.763
Sure. Turn around.

02:54.793 --> 02:57.493
Yeah. Huh.

03:01.763 --> 03:04.403
Oh.

Ralphie Hayes here for
yummy time dog food.

03:58.723 --> 04:03.493
So good a human can eat it.

04:03.523 --> 04:05.333
Do not eat.

04:05.363 --> 04:06.609
<i>Yummy time dog food
is for dogs only.</i>

04:06.633 --> 04:08.703
Yummy.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.403
Are you kidding me?

04:11.433 --> 04:13.403
That guy doesn't
look like me at all.

04:13.433 --> 04:16.503
This dog food <i>horrible.</i>

04:16.543 --> 04:18.413
This video soon.

04:18.442 --> 04:20.313
I don't want to be
remembered as the guy.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.683
Who looks like
horrible-tasting dog food.

04:25.683 --> 04:28.583
Guess who got a job
at the dry-cleaner's?

04:28.623 --> 04:30.383
What happened to your
job at the yo-yo cart?

04:30.423 --> 04:32.653
- It's a long, - You got fired.
Ry.

04:32.693 --> 04:35.623
Huh, I guess or complicated.Ong.

04:36.623 --> 04:38.493
Check out this amazing jacket

04:38.533 --> 04:40.463
I'm borrowing from work
for the music video.

04:40.493 --> 04:41.739
Doesn't that belong to somebody?

04:41.763 --> 04:44.403
Yeah. Some big burly
ultimate fighter guy.

04:44.433 --> 04:46.403
Named facepuncher.

04:46.433 --> 04:49.403
Facepuncher? A guy
named facepuncher?

04:49.443 --> 04:50.549
You know what he's gonna do?!

04:50.573 --> 04:51.743
Facepunch!

04:55.443 --> 04:58.483
Don't worry about it.
He'll never know.

04:58.513 --> 05:00.413
He's gonna pick the
jacket up at 8:00.

05:00.453 --> 05:02.659
Wait, what does the jacket have
to do with the music video?

05:02.683 --> 05:04.683
It's a line in Ally's song,

05:04.723 --> 05:06.593
"my jacket's in the
lost and found."

05:06.623 --> 05:09.493
"my jacket"? It
says "I like it."

05:09.523 --> 05:11.463
The line is "I like it
when you hang around."

05:11.493 --> 05:14.233
"hang around"? I thought
it said "kangaroo."

05:14.263 --> 05:16.333
♪ I like it when you kangaroo.
♪.

05:16.363 --> 05:18.533
Why would I write "I like
it when you kangaroo"?

05:18.573 --> 05:20.633
Look, nobody's accusing you
of writing good lyrics.

05:20.673 --> 05:23.343
Uh, those aren't the lyrics.

05:23.373 --> 05:26.213
My handwriting was only sloppy
because everyone was rushing me.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.413
I went to calligraphy camp!

05:29.443 --> 05:31.413
Book club, calligraphy camp...

05:31.453 --> 05:33.353
Now you're just making stuff up.

05:34.383 --> 05:35.683
Well, whatever.

05:35.723 --> 05:37.629
I still think Austin wearing
a cool leather jacket.

05:37.653 --> 05:39.699
Singing with a kangaroo would
make an awesome music video.

05:39.723 --> 05:42.593
I don't know. I'm starting
to worry about this video.

05:42.623 --> 05:44.563
I think we need to come
up with a better idea.

05:44.593 --> 05:46.533
Yeah, it might be a
little late for that.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.463
Did somebody order a kangaroo?

06:02.213 --> 06:03.583
Oh, he is so cute.

06:03.613 --> 06:07.283
Oh, I just stepped
in kangaroo poop.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.423
Whoa whoa, not so fast.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.323
You don't know that
was the kangaroo.

06:11.353 --> 06:14.293
Trish was in here earlier.

06:14.323 --> 06:18.263
I will smack those freckles
right off your face.

06:18.293 --> 06:22.363
So what's this kangaroo gonna
do in my video besides poop?

06:22.403 --> 06:24.263
Well, I was thinking he
could be in the band.

06:24.303 --> 06:27.333
That's a great idea.

06:27.373 --> 06:31.303
Hey, buddy, wanna
play some guitar?

06:39.413 --> 06:42.353
I think he'd rather play drums.

06:42.383 --> 06:44.553
The window!

06:44.593 --> 06:46.223
Oh, the jacket!

06:46.253 --> 06:47.699
- The door!
- What's wrong with the door?

06:47.723 --> 06:51.393
Nothing. I thought we were
just naming stuff in the room.

06:53.463 --> 06:56.433
No. The kangaroo is chewing
facepuncher's jacket!

06:57.703 --> 07:00.573
Come on, let it go. Let it go.

07:00.603 --> 07:03.173
Let it go. Come on, kangaroo.

07:03.203 --> 07:05.573
Come on, let it go, kangaroo.
Let it go, let it go.

07:05.613 --> 07:08.483
Let it go, let it go.
Come on, come on.

07:08.513 --> 07:11.343
Come on, let it go. Let it go!

07:14.253 --> 07:16.253
Let it go, let it go.

07:18.493 --> 07:22.393
Oh-hh, what is this?

07:22.423 --> 07:25.633
- It's caramel.
- Caramel? Why?

07:25.663 --> 07:28.439
I couldn't read Ally's handwriting and
I wasn't sure if she wrote "camel"

07:28.463 --> 07:30.603
Or "caramel," so I
just got them both.

07:30.633 --> 07:33.303
You ordered a camel too?!

07:33.333 --> 07:35.243
Uh, no-oo.

07:35.273 --> 07:38.203
Did somebody order a camel?

07:38.243 --> 07:40.543
We've got to fix this mess
before my dad gets back.

07:40.573 --> 07:43.583
We have to fix the jacket.
Facepuncher's coming back at 8:00.

07:43.613 --> 07:47.213
I could lose my job, which
I don't care about.

07:47.253 --> 07:49.453
But still, he might
facepunch me.

07:49.483 --> 07:52.253
And someone's gonna have to
mop up all this Trish poop.

07:52.293 --> 07:55.493
Mm, keep it up and someone's gonna
have to mop up all your freckles.

07:55.523 --> 07:58.593
My freckles are my friends! Can
you say that about your poop?

08:00.363 --> 08:03.163
- So what about my video?
- Can we worry.

08:03.203 --> 08:05.403
About something other than
your career for one minute?

08:05.433 --> 08:07.173
I barely have a career.

08:07.203 --> 08:09.319
If you wouldn't have taken a
whole month to write a new song,

08:09.343 --> 08:11.543
Maybe people wouldn't think
I'm the dog food guy.

08:11.573 --> 08:15.343
Hang on. Are you
actually blaming me.

08:15.383 --> 08:17.559
Because you think you're not
as popular as you used to be?

08:17.583 --> 08:19.453
No, of course not.

08:19.483 --> 08:22.223
I'm just saying that maybe if
you'd written the song faster,

08:22.253 --> 08:24.583
Then we'd have... you know what?

08:24.623 --> 08:26.593
Now that I'm saying
this out loud,

08:26.623 --> 08:28.323
I think that is
what I was saying.

08:28.363 --> 08:30.593
I can't just spit out a song.

08:30.623 --> 08:32.433
Anytime you want me to.

08:32.462 --> 08:34.332
Lyrics don't just
flow out of me.

08:34.363 --> 08:36.563
Like a River after
a rain of tears.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.602
Oh, that's good.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.403
Hey, Ally, you know what?

08:42.443 --> 08:46.373
Maybe you should write that so we
could actually read it this time.

08:46.413 --> 08:48.683
Yeah, miss calligraphy camp.

08:48.713 --> 08:51.283
Huh. Can you read this?

08:51.313 --> 08:53.213
Yes, I can,

08:53.253 --> 08:54.583
And that is <i>not a nice word.</i>

09:12.445 --> 09:15.675
There's gotta be some way
we can clean this jacket.

09:15.715 --> 09:17.645
You work at a dry-cleaner's.

09:19.145 --> 09:20.455
Right!

09:20.485 --> 09:24.255
I bet there's some sort of
jacket-cleaning machine.

09:25.455 --> 09:28.525
I'd better go with you.
You guys watch the store.

09:28.555 --> 09:31.265
I'll call Martin the mall
maintenance man to fix the window.

09:31.295 --> 09:34.135
My dad sees this
mess, I'm toast.

09:34.165 --> 09:38.165
And if we don't fix facepuncher's
jacket, I'm toast.

09:38.205 --> 09:40.281
And if we don't get a good
video up on the site soon,

09:40.305 --> 09:42.475
My whole career is toast.

09:42.505 --> 09:44.605
Anyone else craving
toast right now?

09:54.485 --> 09:56.255
And I don't know
what Austin expects.

09:56.285 --> 09:58.231
He doesn't appreciate the
fact that I can't spend.

09:58.255 --> 09:59.531
Every minute of every
day writing songs.

09:59.555 --> 10:02.195
And even if I could, it takes
time to write a good song.

10:02.225 --> 10:05.425
He needs to understand that trying
to rush you doesn't help anything.

10:05.465 --> 10:07.595
Thanks, Trish. I
knew you would...

10:07.635 --> 10:10.305
Hurry up with the jacket!
We don't have all day!

10:11.635 --> 10:13.505
I don't know. I don't know.

10:13.535 --> 10:16.605
I don't know. No, this
isn't the ear doctor!

10:16.645 --> 10:19.175
Austin! Austin,
little help, please.

10:19.205 --> 10:21.251
I'm really busy. I promised
Ally I'd watch the store.

10:21.275 --> 10:22.875
I can't just leave a
stranger in charge.

10:27.315 --> 10:29.255
Hey, stranger, you're in charge!

10:29.285 --> 10:31.585
I'm coming, buddy!

10:36.525 --> 10:38.665
Ugh, I tried, like,
seven different things.

10:38.695 --> 10:42.465
Everything I use keeps getting
caramelled to the jacket.

10:45.265 --> 10:48.335
That's him! That's facepuncher!

10:51.375 --> 10:55.215
- I'm here for my jacket.
- Uh, you're facepuncher?

10:55.245 --> 10:56.645
You don't look like
a facepuncher.

10:56.685 --> 11:00.485
You look like a hand
holder or a hug giver.

11:00.515 --> 11:03.255
No hug.

11:03.285 --> 11:06.585
Uh, you're early. The jacket's not
supposed to be ready until 8:00.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.525
No. It's supposed
to be ready now.

11:12.595 --> 11:15.235
Oh, look at that. You're right.

11:15.265 --> 11:18.605
I misread the ticket. It's 'cause I'm
a horrible employee. Ask anybody.

11:18.635 --> 11:21.235
Actually, she wouldn't be that
bad if she just applied herself.

11:21.275 --> 11:23.275
- Ally!
- She is the worst!

11:23.305 --> 11:26.175
I'll be back at 8:00.

11:26.215 --> 11:29.275
And it better be ready 'cause
mad dog's gonna be with me,

11:29.315 --> 11:33.385
And mad dog hates waiting.

11:35.455 --> 11:38.285
Ooh, that was close.

11:38.325 --> 11:41.195
Close? He'll be back
in a few hours.

11:41.225 --> 11:42.601
And he's bringing
mad dog with him.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.595
Oh right.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.235
Maybe this super-duper washing
machine will do the trick.

11:47.265 --> 11:49.665
- Do you know how to use that thing?
- Of course not.

11:52.565 --> 11:55.305
- I'm trying.
- You can do it.

11:57.575 --> 11:59.605
I'll be right with you.

12:03.415 --> 12:07.485
- You see the kangaroo too, right?
- Uh-huh.

12:26.405 --> 12:29.205
- You'll never guess what happened!
- The kangaroo ran away.

12:29.235 --> 12:31.245
Man, you're good at this game.

12:31.275 --> 12:34.145
How could you lose a kangaroo?!

12:34.175 --> 12:35.451
I was attaching a
camera to its pouch.

12:35.475 --> 12:37.445
When I accidentally
stepped on its tail.

12:37.485 --> 12:39.385
And woke him up from
a deep dark sleep,

12:39.415 --> 12:41.215
And then for no reason
he just freaked out.

12:42.455 --> 12:45.485
Why would you attach a
camera to a kangaroo?

12:45.525 --> 12:48.125
Because we're trying to
make an awesome video.

12:48.155 --> 12:50.341
Are me and Dez the only ones who
care about my career anymore?

12:50.365 --> 12:53.195
I care about your career. I'm
just not gonna overreact.

12:53.235 --> 12:55.165
Because one person didn't
know who you were.

12:55.195 --> 12:59.205
Hey, Ally, I'm here to... whoa, it's
ralphie Hayes the dog food guy!

12:59.235 --> 13:01.475
I'm not the dog food guy.

13:03.275 --> 13:06.045
Hey, Martin, can you fix the
window before my dad gets back?

13:06.075 --> 13:09.075
No problem, I fix a lot of... whoa,
this thing is really broken!

13:09.115 --> 13:13.115
You are in so much trouble.
This is bad! This is bad!

13:14.255 --> 13:15.415
Calm down, Martin.

13:15.455 --> 13:17.085
How much is it going to cost?

13:17.125 --> 13:19.355
Uh, probably not... whoa,
this is gonna cost a lot!

13:19.385 --> 13:21.531
That's double-paned glass. I
gotta get it custom built,

13:21.555 --> 13:24.125
Then I gotta pick it up and
it's so hard to find parking.

13:24.165 --> 13:25.401
And the place doesn't
even open until...

13:25.425 --> 13:27.435
How much is it going to cost?

13:31.305 --> 13:33.135
It can't be that bad.

13:33.175 --> 13:36.505
Whoa, this is bad! This is bad!

13:40.145 --> 13:42.075
I can't wait for this
mess to be over.

13:42.115 --> 13:43.561
So we can get back to
shooting my video.

13:43.585 --> 13:47.355
Some lady just made me take
a picture with her dog.

13:47.385 --> 13:49.185
I hope you charged
her $500 for it.

13:49.215 --> 13:51.325
Because that's what we
need to fix the window.

13:53.425 --> 13:55.455
Dez, what are you doing?

13:55.495 --> 13:59.495
Leaving a trail of manges,
croutons and fish sticks.

13:59.535 --> 14:02.195
Everybody knows this is how
you attract kangaroos.

14:06.165 --> 14:09.305
No, wait, that's how
you attract a llama.

14:12.345 --> 14:15.445
Hang on. The kangaroo's got
your video camera, right?

14:15.475 --> 14:17.415
Isn't it synced
to our computers?

14:17.445 --> 14:19.315
Yes! We can watch the
live video feed.

14:19.345 --> 14:21.155
And see where the kangaroo is.

14:21.185 --> 14:22.455
Yeah.

14:26.085 --> 14:28.255
Whoa!

14:28.295 --> 14:32.195
Run! Run!

14:32.225 --> 14:34.195
<i>Whoa, look out! Man 2: Whoa!</i>

14:34.235 --> 14:36.465
That's by the food court!

14:36.505 --> 14:39.335
Here I come, kangaroo!

14:45.105 --> 14:47.475
Guess who just solved
all our problems?

14:47.515 --> 14:49.175
- You did?
- Yep.

14:49.215 --> 14:51.445
Man, Ally, how are you
so good at this game?

14:54.255 --> 14:55.455
An hour from now,

14:55.485 --> 14:57.325
Austin is gonna perform
a concert in the store.

14:57.355 --> 15:00.385
I've pre-sold 100 tickets
at six bucks apiece.

15:00.425 --> 15:02.095
Here's 500 bucks.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.425
That should be $600.

15:03.465 --> 15:07.095
What? I needed a new purse
to carry all the money in.

15:07.135 --> 15:10.165
Well, this is great. Now
we can fix the window!

15:10.205 --> 15:12.465
Seriously? 100 people
bought tickets to see me?

15:12.505 --> 15:15.305
- Yep! Seven bucks apiece.
- You said six.

15:15.335 --> 15:18.175
So what? I'm gonna get a new purse
and not get new shoes to match?

15:18.205 --> 15:21.275
- I mean come on.
- Cute.

15:21.315 --> 15:25.315
This is awesome! And I thought
nobody knew who I was anymore.

15:25.345 --> 15:28.255
Take that, dog food guy! Whoo!

15:30.085 --> 15:32.255
This is incredible! I can't
believe all those people.

15:32.285 --> 15:34.225
Bought tickets to
see Austin perform.

15:34.255 --> 15:36.425
Well-ll...

15:36.465 --> 15:38.465
Uh-oh,

15:38.495 --> 15:40.495
That was a long "well."
what did you do?

15:40.535 --> 15:42.065
Well-ll...

15:42.095 --> 15:45.205
Sorry. Everyone's
actually coming.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.135
To get their picture
taken with the kangaroo.

15:47.175 --> 15:49.335
Austin's more like the
unannounced opening act.

15:49.375 --> 15:52.405
What? If he finds
out, it'll crush him.

15:52.445 --> 15:54.415
You saw how excited he was.

15:54.445 --> 15:56.275
Then I guess he can't find out.

16:00.855 --> 16:02.295
You see the llama too, right?

16:14.575 --> 16:17.405
Oh, this is the best
show I've ever seen!

16:17.445 --> 16:19.445
- What is it?
- It's called.

16:19.475 --> 16:21.515
"Dez gets his butt
kicked by a kangaroo."

16:27.255 --> 16:29.285
Oh. Ooh! Ouch!

16:29.325 --> 16:32.385
Oh, that is not a place you
want a kangaroo to kick you.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.255
Ooh.

16:34.295 --> 16:36.265
What are you doing?

16:36.295 --> 16:38.395
I'm writing some new
lyrics for Austin's song.

16:38.435 --> 16:41.435
Since people are coming to see
the kangaroo and not him,

16:41.465 --> 16:43.541
I wanna help Austin give the
best performance he can.

16:43.565 --> 16:45.681
You're not going to tell him
about the kangaroo, are you?

16:45.705 --> 16:49.335
- Well-ll...
- Ally!

16:49.375 --> 16:51.645
No. I'm... I'm just torn because
I hate lying to people,

16:51.675 --> 16:54.515
But I know how much it'll hurt
Austin to know the truth.

16:54.545 --> 16:57.315
I'm torn too.

16:57.345 --> 16:59.655
I need Dez to get the
kangaroo back here,

16:59.685 --> 17:03.355
But I never want this to end.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.395
Ouch! That one's
gonna leave a mark.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.494
That one will leave a mark. Oh.

17:09.525 --> 17:13.265
♪ Oh, 'cause I know
that I'll make it ♪

17:13.295 --> 17:15.295

Hey, Ally. Just
practicing for the show.

17:19.535 --> 17:21.405
There's a lot of people
coming to see me.

17:21.435 --> 17:25.305
Yeah, coming to see you...
only you,

17:25.345 --> 17:27.515
Not an animal from Australia.

17:28.545 --> 17:31.485
Why would I say that?

17:31.515 --> 17:34.585
Here, I wrote some new lyrics.

17:34.615 --> 17:36.425
I just want you to have
the best show you can.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.495
Since people aren't really
coming to see you...

17:39.525 --> 17:41.525
Perform a bad show.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.565
Which you won't. Gotta go!

17:44.595 --> 17:47.435
Wait.

17:47.465 --> 17:49.511
I'm sorry about giving you a
hard time about the song.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.635
I was just nervous that maybe
no one knew who I was anymore,

17:52.675 --> 17:54.475
But obviously that's
not the case.

17:54.505 --> 17:57.405
Definitely not the case.
Apology accepted. Gotta go.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.715
Finally I got the kangaroo.

18:02.745 --> 18:04.585
That was not easy.

18:07.285 --> 18:10.625
Now people can finally
see who they came for.

18:10.655 --> 18:13.295
You!

18:13.325 --> 18:15.395
Gotta go.

18:18.535 --> 18:23.365
What's up, everybody?! Whoo!

18:29.345 --> 18:31.405
Excuse me, sir. Thanks
for coming out.

18:31.445 --> 18:33.615
- Where's the kangaroo?!
- Yeah.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.545
Oh, we caught him.
He's upstairs.

18:35.585 --> 18:37.315
Thanks for your concern.
He's all good.

18:37.345 --> 18:38.615
All right, this is a new song.

18:38.655 --> 18:41.385

Austin, Austin, Austin,
Austin, Austin...

19:57.895 --> 19:59.795
- This is so awesome.
- Oh, this is great.

19:59.835 --> 20:01.135
See, this footage sick.

20:01.165 --> 20:03.805
I can totally cut this together
into a great live video.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.951
For the new song and have it
up on the website tonight.

20:05.975 --> 20:07.805
- Awesome!
- That's great!

20:07.835 --> 20:10.945
Oh, you really won all
those people over.

20:10.975 --> 20:14.915
They came for the kangaroo,
but they stayed for the moon.

20:14.945 --> 20:16.945
What do you mean?

20:18.155 --> 20:20.185
This is why you should
not tell me secrets.

20:20.215 --> 20:24.725
Um, uh, those people weren't
exactly there to see you.

20:24.755 --> 20:27.101
They were there to get their
picture taken with the kangaroo.

20:27.125 --> 20:30.125
So those people didn't
know who I was?

20:30.165 --> 20:33.135
Uh, but they do now, and that's
all that really matters.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.965
Okay, I'm cool with that.

20:36.005 --> 20:37.805
As long as you keep
performing like that,

20:37.835 --> 20:39.151
There will always be
Austin moon fans.

20:39.175 --> 20:42.135
Thanks. But as long as you
keep writing songs like that,

20:42.175 --> 20:44.045
I'll always be an
Ally Dawson fan.

20:44.075 --> 20:46.045
- Thanks.
- But please don't make me wait.

20:46.075 --> 20:47.975
Another month for a new song.

20:48.015 --> 20:50.085
Oh, fine, read this
for my book club.

20:50.115 --> 20:53.055
And tell me what it's about.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.155
I can wait a month.

20:56.085 --> 20:59.225
Uh, guys.

20:59.255 --> 21:01.225
Wait, the jacket...
it looks different.

21:01.255 --> 21:04.225
Yeah, 'cause it shrunk
and it is pink!

21:04.265 --> 21:07.095
No, that's not it.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.905
Hey! Where's my jacket?

21:10.935 --> 21:13.775
It better be ready.
Mad dog's waiting,

21:13.805 --> 21:16.775
And mad dog hates to wait.

21:17.905 --> 21:19.945
Here you go.

21:19.975 --> 21:22.915
That will be $6...

21:22.945 --> 21:24.985
Or free.

21:25.015 --> 21:27.955
Oh, my jacket!

21:27.985 --> 21:30.785
What did you do to my
championship jacket?

21:30.825 --> 21:32.895
Yeah, I couldn't put my
finger on it either.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.925
- Whoa!
- Mr. Facepuncher?

21:36.995 --> 21:38.925
This is all my fault.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.111
My friends were just trying to help
me out, and if you're gonna punch.

21:41.135 --> 21:44.165
Anyone in the face, it
should probably be me.

21:44.205 --> 21:47.735
Though I kind of need my face, so if
you could punch me in the shoulder,

21:47.775 --> 21:50.205
The foot, the hip or
even pull my hair...

21:50.245 --> 21:52.183
How about I punch you
in all of the above?

21:52.195 --> 21:54.145
Daddy, hurry up.

21:54.175 --> 21:56.015
You know I hate waiting.

21:57.045 --> 21:59.185
Hang on a sec, mad dog.

21:59.215 --> 22:01.055
Daddy has a situation.

22:01.085 --> 22:02.925
That's mad dog?

22:02.955 --> 22:04.225
Is that for me?

22:05.725 --> 22:07.155
It's beautiful. I love it!

22:07.195 --> 22:11.795
You're the best daddy in
the whole world ever!

22:11.835 --> 22:14.035
I knew you'd love it, Pumpkin.

22:17.735 --> 22:20.975
No way! You're Austin moon!

22:23.105 --> 22:25.075
Can you autograph my jacket?

22:25.115 --> 22:26.215
Of course.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.785
Oh.

22:32.215 --> 22:34.985
- There you go.
- Thanks, Austin.

22:35.025 --> 22:38.085
- No problem.
- Hey, aren't you the guy.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.895
- That ate the 20-lb hamburger?
- Why, yes I am!

22:47.765 --> 22:50.765
- I didn't ask for an autograph.
- Uh-oh.

22:55.245 --> 22:59.045
Beat him up fast, daddy.
You know I hate waiting.

23:01.915 --> 23:04.185
Ally, I'm home from the
accordion conven...

23:04.215 --> 23:09.825
Oh! Oh, why is there
a kangarooey-pooey.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.855
In my room? Hey.

23:11.895 --> 23:14.055
No more! No! Stop! Stop!

23:14.095 --> 23:16.025
Down! Mad kangaroo attack!

23:22.165 --> 23:24.765
How many times are you
going to watch that?

23:24.805 --> 23:26.175
Till it stops being funny.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.005
Oh!
