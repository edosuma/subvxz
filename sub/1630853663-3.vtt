WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.588
- So, what do we know about
my daughter's murder and the theft?

00:04.588 --> 00:07.424
- Why don't you ask these three?
They're the ones that probably did it.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.634
- We were framed.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.761
- We're persons of interest.
It's very different.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.514
<i>So what we need to do
is break into Bunny's apartment.</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:15.516
<i>We find a clue that isn't us.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:17.059
<i>Don't you want to clear your name, too?</i>

00:17.059 --> 00:19.144
- Bunny had a bird?

00:19.144 --> 00:20.521
- Mrs. Gambolini.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.688
Stuff it up your ass.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.399
- Start scouring!
Any paper you find, put in this bag.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.778
- I would just like to assure all of you,

00:27.778 --> 00:29.780
as the new Board President,

00:29.780 --> 00:33.283
I will not let Bunny's demise
adversely affect the building.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.160
I'm in charge now,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.371
and a new era begins.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.580
- Don't get me started on Nina.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.123
If you thought Bunny was a bitch,

00:40.123 --> 00:41.708
wait till you get a load of this one.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.044
- So I took a closer look
at Bunny's will.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.004
There's something she wanted you to have.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.006
- No! Absolutely not.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.341
Hey!

00:49.341 --> 00:50.634
Hey!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.389
I know who did it!

01:03.647 --> 01:05.524
<i>The perfect crime?</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:07.734
<i>Oh, so very nearly.</i>

01:08.610 --> 01:12.114
But there's one thing
the killer did <i>not</i> anticipate.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.615
A witness.

01:13.615 --> 01:17.119
Who has bravely agreed to
an <i>Only Murders in the Building</i> exclusive.

01:17.119 --> 01:20.080
So, tell our listeners,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.708
who killed Bunny Folger?

01:22.708 --> 01:23.959
Fuck off, Oliver.

01:23.959 --> 01:27.796
- No, you fuck off, Mrs. Gambolini!
You said you know who did it!

01:27.796 --> 01:29.965
- Who did it?
- It's just perfect

01:29.965 --> 01:32.718
that Bunny had a pet
as obnoxious as she was.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.179
- Hey, that's my maybe half-sister
you're talking about.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.014
- Yeah, explain that to me one more time.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.390
- Well, it's simple.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.309
My dad maybe slept with Bunny's mom,

01:40.309 --> 01:43.312
a-and that potential sex
could have been unprotected,

01:43.312 --> 01:46.398
and that possibly
unprotected potential sex

01:46.398 --> 01:49.484
could have resulted in a half-sister
I never knew until it was too late.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.445
- Are you done? Please say yes.
- Yes.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.654
- Great.
- No.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.072
- I kissed Bunny on the lips.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.074
- You did what?
- What?

01:56.074 --> 01:58.702
- Yeah. It was at a Christmas party,
and we were saying goodbye,

01:58.702 --> 02:01.455
and we were just gonna kiss
each other on the cheek, but we missed,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.165
and we were on the lips,

02:03.165 --> 02:04.750
and we'd had a few eggnogs,

02:04.750 --> 02:07.628
so we kinda got into it,
and then we just stayed there

02:07.628 --> 02:10.923
and sloshed around a little bit,
and that's not so bad, right?

02:10.923 --> 02:12.299
- Can you deal with this, please?

02:12.299 --> 02:13.550
- Yeah, sure.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.845
Alright. We have two options here.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.431
I slap you across the face
and say, "Snap out of it!"

02:19.431 --> 02:21.600
Or we just skip to the part where you say,

02:21.600 --> 02:24.019
"Thanks, kid. That was tough
to hear, but I needed it."

02:24.019 --> 02:25.270
- Uh, not the slapping one.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.396
- Cool.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.941
- Who did it?!
- Who did it?

02:28.941 --> 02:32.486
- God, you are the most difficult animal
I have ever directed.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.280
And I did a production of <i>The Elephant Man</i>
with a real elephant.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.867
- Oliver, have you tried
talking to her as if you were Bunny?

02:39.618 --> 02:41.245
- W-why would I ever...

02:45.832 --> 02:49.586
Mrs. Gambolini. It's me, Bunny.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.506
What the fuck happened to me, huh?

02:53.382 --> 02:55.425
- That was a terrible Bunny.
The key to a good Bunny

02:55.425 --> 02:57.761
is raising your voice
without raising your voice.

02:59.096 --> 03:03.016
Mrs. Gambolini, why the fuck am I dead?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.393
No, no, that's dreadful.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.895
You're missing the smile that
doesn't reach the dead eyes.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.274
This won't take long

03:10.274 --> 03:12.317
unless you make it take long.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.528
This won't take long

03:14.528 --> 03:16.446
unless you make it take long.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.240
- Yeah, but we're doing Bunny.
- Oh, geez.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.283
Listen to this.

03:19.283 --> 03:22.786
If you're a murderer, stop murdering!

03:22.786 --> 03:24.079
- Yeah, well--
- Hey!

03:24.913 --> 03:26.957
We need to start making progress here.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.751
- Alright. What do we know?

03:29.751 --> 03:32.171
Bunny was killed with a knitting needle

03:32.171 --> 03:33.839
and a still-missing knife.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.757
Her last words

03:35.757 --> 03:37.843
were "14" and "savage."

03:37.843 --> 03:41.263
- She got notes threatening her
to give up her pricey painting

03:41.263 --> 03:44.057
of your dad's jiminy sack or else.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.810
- Yeah, and where is the original...
My dad's what?

03:46.810 --> 03:49.938
- His jiminy sack?
Did I just make that up?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.566
- Hey, look at this. Receipts.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.569
From March 12th.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.030
The day that Bunny died.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.867
- We saw Bunny that day.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.581
- Uh-- Okay. Tha-that's very good. Okay.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.586
What would your last day on Earth be like?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.505
It's a good question.

04:14.505 --> 04:15.923
Will it be like any other,

04:15.923 --> 04:18.592
or will it point to it being your time?

04:19.009 --> 04:21.011
As we recreate Bunny's,

04:21.011 --> 04:24.014
we hope it will take us to clues,

04:24.014 --> 04:25.849
suspects,

04:25.849 --> 04:28.227
and please, dear God,

04:28.227 --> 04:30.145
not the subway.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.733
Wake up. Wake up.

04:34.733 --> 04:35.984
Wake up.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.820
Wake up! Bunny!

04:38.820 --> 04:40.489
Wake up!
- Mm, shut up,

04:40.489 --> 04:43.575
or I'll come over there
and hit your snooze button.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.514
I can't believe this is my last day.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.106
As Board President.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.955
<i>That
asshole's getting rid of all the gifted</i>

06:11.955 --> 06:15.083
<i>and talented programs in our schools.
He wants our kids stupid.</i>

06:15.792 --> 06:18.587
<i>Also, he works out at the YMCA.</i>

06:18.587 --> 06:21.006
<i>In Park Slope, Brooklyn.</i>

06:21.006 --> 06:23.425
<i>I just don't understand what's
going on in the city anymore.</i>

06:23.425 --> 06:25.010
<i>There's a Starbucks on every corner.</i>

06:25.010 --> 06:27.554
<i>You can't even get
a decent bagel anywhere.</i>

06:27.554 --> 06:29.890
<i>All the bridges keep changing names.</i>

06:29.890 --> 06:33.685
<i>It is not the same New York City
I grew up in, that's for sure.</i>

06:41.276 --> 06:42.778
- Ah, that.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.326
Same circus, different clowns.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.744
Fire Dolan.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.955
- You said it.

06:53.455 --> 06:56.708
"Twenty-nine years as Board President.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.253
"I inherited the position from my mother.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.673
"You know,
she warned me that part of the job

07:02.673 --> 07:04.800
"would be dealing with pests.

07:05.551 --> 07:09.096
What she didn't say was
the tenants were the pests."

07:10.639 --> 07:14.017
Pause for laugh. "Of course, I'm kidding.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.062
"Serving you...

07:17.062 --> 07:19.064
has been one of the great honors of my..."

07:28.782 --> 07:31.743
I'm not gonna let
those fuckers see me cry.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.460
I guess quiet time is over.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.819
- Good morning, Bunny!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.070
You watch the game last night?

08:07.070 --> 08:09.823
- Yeah. Why do you think
I'm in a bad mood?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.617
- Ooh.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.203
We should catch a game someday,
now with all your free time.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.997
- Yeah. That'd be great, Tommy.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.208
See you later.
- Okay, Bunny.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.885
- Lin-sanity!

08:36.391 --> 08:39.811
- Oh, what a lovely mess to come home to!

08:42.773 --> 08:45.651
Don't worry, Lester. I've got it.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.737
You're as useless as tits on a nun.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.322
Sorry. I'm eatin' cake.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.576
- And I'm still president of this place
for another few hours.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.328
There's still time
to replace you, you know?

08:56.328 --> 08:57.454
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.500
- Tell Lorraine I hope her knee is better.
- Mm-hmm. Will do.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.837
- Before I forget,
elevator inspection invoice.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.964
- Oh.
- You know,

09:06.964 --> 09:09.383
this place is gonna
fall apart without you.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.553
- You're going to say the same thing
when Nina's in charge.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.888
- Ah! I'd never!

09:14.888 --> 09:17.266
So, what are you gonna do
with all your free time?

09:17.266 --> 09:19.059
- I can't believe I'm saying this,

09:19.059 --> 09:21.395
but I've been looking at a spot in Boca.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.107
Turns out, there are places on the planet

09:25.107 --> 09:26.900
without winter.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.197
What's going on over there?

09:33.407 --> 09:36.827
- We reach the basement,
and I <i>immediately</i> identify the problem.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.496
I said, "Mabel! The ductwork
around the down-flow furnace

09:39.496 --> 09:40.789
"has been tampered with. Quick!

09:40.789 --> 09:43.375
Flip the damper and detach that hose!"

09:43.375 --> 09:46.545
- Huh? I just remember
you saying "thing" a lot. Like,

09:46.545 --> 09:49.006
"Put the thing on the thing!"
And then, "The thing and the thing!"

09:49.006 --> 09:51.175
Oh! And Charles,

09:51.175 --> 09:53.468
how was it doing battle
with your girlfriend?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.387
- Oh, well, to be honest,
there wasn't so much thinking...

09:55.387 --> 09:56.430
- That was probably the poison.

09:56.430 --> 09:59.808
- ...as doing. With a gun pointed at me,
I commandeered a vehicle.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.811
- A dog stroller.
- I drove it into Jan. She fired!

10:02.811 --> 10:04.271
- Bang! The bullet hit me!

10:04.271 --> 10:06.648
- No.
- Hit near me. And then I dodged.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.400
And then I knocked the gun from her grasp!

10:08.400 --> 10:11.528
- And then Mabel came in
and punched Jan in the face.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.532
- I mean, I did lay her out.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.161
Oh, hey, Bunny.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.289
- Ah! Bun-Bun! We saved you some cake.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.251
- Rule 5.05.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.795
No gatherings of more than 12

10:28.795 --> 10:30.547
in a communal area

10:30.547 --> 10:32.841
without the approval of the board.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.259
- May we have your approval?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.720
- No. Is that an open flame?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.347
Oh, come on. I mean,

10:38.347 --> 10:41.225
it's the almost one-week anniversary
of them saving the building.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.351
You should be thanking them.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.230
- And I'll thank <i>you</i> to stay outta this!

10:46.230 --> 10:48.899
- Oh! I just got Bunny'd!

10:49.942 --> 10:52.736
- You know, for a while,
I thought <i>you</i> were the killer

10:52.736 --> 10:55.239
because Tim was behind
on his building fees,

10:55.239 --> 10:58.033
and I distrust women
in positions of power.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.660
- God no, Marv.
- No, Marv, no. Shh.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.287
- Do you have a permit to sell those?

11:02.287 --> 11:04.748
- Uh... I do not.

11:04.748 --> 11:08.210
- Commercial sales are
prohibited from the Arconia

11:08.210 --> 11:11.380
without a board-issued permit.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.799
- Noncompliance will result
in a public flogging

11:13.799 --> 11:15.592
and a fine of $20.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.678
The rule was written in 1912.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.429
We should update that.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.682
- I don't know. I like the floggings.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.726
Nina, walk with me.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.898
They're gonna be your problem tomorrow.
- Don't worry. I'll keep giving them hell.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.277
- I'll take a mug.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.579
- Well, these are for--
- Outside the elevator bank?

11:43.579 --> 11:45.414
I saw the ones there are dead.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.045
- Sounds like there might be
snow next week.

11:52.838 --> 11:55.048
- I'll remind Lester to put out
mats by the door.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.049
- Hm...

11:57.301 --> 12:00.387
The bulb in the fountain--
- Needs to be replaced.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.139
I'll tell Mr. Torres.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.601
You focus on enjoying yourself.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.603
You've earned it.

12:13.108 --> 12:16.862
Acupressure. Midwife says
pushing here helps induce labor.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.072
I'll try anything at this point.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.075
- You sure you're gonna be
able to handle this place?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.660
- Absolutely.

12:23.660 --> 12:27.247
I'm gonna pop this baby out and strap it
right to my chest without breaking stride.

12:28.332 --> 12:31.293
Come on. Eject.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.879
- Oh. One last lesson for the road.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.839
Be careful with Mark.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.759
He's a compulsive liar.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.844
He'll talk about touring in Iraq,

12:40.844 --> 12:43.847
but it was just with his band.
They're not bad.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.850
And Sonia...

12:48.727 --> 12:50.896
will sometimes mention her husband,

12:50.896 --> 12:52.773
and sometimes a boyfriend.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.900
She wants you to ask.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.026
Don't.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.820
- You know everything about everyone.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.406
- That's the job.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.287
- Rotates the fetus.
Stimulates contractions.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.791
- Don't have it here.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.460
But if your water does break--

13:13.460 --> 13:17.172
- Mop is in the window closet,
second door from the stairs. I know.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.716
Alright.

13:21.260 --> 13:24.513
Now let's get these to their
new home where they belong.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.436
Aren't you coming?

13:32.062 --> 13:34.857
- No. I've got my things to do.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.233
I'll see you at the board meeting.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.609
- Mm-hmm.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.155
- Florida?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.575
Really? <i>You?</i>

13:44.575 --> 13:46.243
- Why not me?

13:46.243 --> 13:48.745
Why can't I try life as a snowbird?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.747
- I have a cousin in Tallahassee.

13:50.747 --> 13:51.748
- And?

13:51.748 --> 13:53.208
- Eh, he sweats a lot.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.086
He's got a fungus in his armpits
he can't get rid of.

13:56.795 --> 14:00.215
- Is that your cute way of saying
you don't want me to go?

14:00.215 --> 14:03.510
- No, go. You know I have a key.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.513
Maybe I'll go into your place
and wear all your stuff.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.309
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.481
Okay. I'm this way.

14:22.196 --> 14:23.697
- Hello?

14:25.032 --> 14:27.034
Oh, it's you.

14:27.743 --> 14:30.495
No, I do <i>not</i> wanna talk
about the painting.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.914
Stop calling!

14:47.471 --> 14:51.225
<i>On its surface,
it was a day like any other for Bunny,</i>

14:51.225 --> 14:54.686
<i>filled with routines
and reading the Riot Act.</i>

14:54.686 --> 14:57.773
<i>But where within those rituals
were the signals</i>

14:57.773 --> 15:00.817
<i>that the day was anything but typical?</i>

15:00.817 --> 15:02.694
- Welcome, Bunny. How are you today?

15:02.694 --> 15:05.113
- Ah, same old.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.199
As in I'm the...
Same.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.408
Old.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.619
- I'll just have the usual.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.120
- Coming right up.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.624
Oh, uh, is your friend from
yesterday joining you?

15:15.624 --> 15:17.334
- My friend?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.211
- Another waiter took my shift yesterday

15:19.211 --> 15:21.421
and said you were... with someone.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.967
- Oh, no. Not coming. And not my friend.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.353
Seriously, Dad, it's not a big deal.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.606
- What are you talking about?
It's a <i>huge</i> deal.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.108
My own son directing?
Yeah,

15:41.108 --> 15:42.818
a play at my kid's school.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.195
- Well, we have to start somewhere.
Can I tell you something?

15:45.195 --> 15:47.573
You are going to be a natural
because it's in your blood, buddy.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.575
- Food.
- Oh, thank you.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.830
Bunny!
- What?!

15:54.830 --> 15:56.748
You remember my son, Will.
Of course.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.418
He broke a window when he was 10.

15:59.418 --> 16:01.753
You still haven't paid for it.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.714
- You moving to Florida?

16:03.714 --> 16:05.424
Yeah, I would love to live somewhere warm.

16:05.424 --> 16:06.592
- Oh no, no, no.

16:06.592 --> 16:07.801
Bunny and I, we're lifers.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.012
She's probably gonna be
buried in the Arconia.

16:10.012 --> 16:13.307
And on hot days, the whole building
will be able to smell you.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.516
Anyway,

16:14.516 --> 16:17.769
I-I-I should be going.
I'm celebrating with Charles and Mabel.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.147
You know,
since we solved the Tim Kono case.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.648
Bye-bye now.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.027
- How the fuck does she know
about that broken window?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.778
- 'Cause she's an actual witch,
that's why.

16:32.576 --> 16:35.162
- Here we go.
- Thank you, Ivan.

16:37.331 --> 16:40.125
That's for the food.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.461
And then...

16:44.046 --> 16:46.048
I went over 20%.

16:48.759 --> 16:51.053
- Oh, Bunny...

16:51.053 --> 16:52.346
Th-that's too much this time.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.723
- No one else who needs it.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.226
Come on, take it.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.103
Get yourself that DJ equipment you wanted.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.857
- Okay.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.569
Thank you.
- And make me a promise.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.823
Don't let yourself only love one thing.

17:12.908 --> 17:14.743
Because if you only love one thing,

17:14.743 --> 17:17.871
and then one thing goes away, well...

17:20.582 --> 17:22.960
then you're left with nothing.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.420
And that sucks.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.677
- A-are you asking for more iced tea?

17:34.805 --> 17:37.099
- Finally, he hears me.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.990
- ...so good. Hold it!

17:58.787 --> 18:00.914
You wanna go to my place
and get those, uh, glasses now?

18:00.914 --> 18:03.041
- Oh, perfect. Mm-mmm!
- Yeah.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.544
You know, champagne
is not really champagne

18:05.544 --> 18:08.839
unless it's from the region of Champagne.
Where is that from?

18:08.839 --> 18:11.300
- The Key Foods on 81st Street.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.177
- Ah. Lovely vineyard.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.055
- Hey, Bunny.

18:17.848 --> 18:18.849
All that looks good.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.810
- Oh. Board meeting snacks.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.235
- Deep breaths.
- Take it easy.

18:30.235 --> 18:33.405
- It's okay.
The firefighters are coming.

18:35.449 --> 18:38.410
I'm warm. Is anyone else getting warm?

18:38.410 --> 18:40.037
- The fans stopped.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.792
A slight breeze. I feel a slight breeze.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.711
That means oxygen is flowing.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.254
Come on... Okay...

18:50.005 --> 18:51.882
- Bunny, you're a badass.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.677
- And I thought
I was a cranky old bitch.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.638
- Yeah, I knew I'd regret that.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.987
- Well, thank God.
What would we do without you?

19:22.287 --> 19:23.664
- You know what I just realized?

19:24.831 --> 19:27.125
I fucking hate the heat.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.178
Surprise!

19:41.265 --> 19:43.851
- I did the decorations!
Do you like them?

19:43.851 --> 19:45.018
Don't worry.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.604
You get a hat, too.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.985
- Oh...

19:52.985 --> 19:54.987
- Yeah. I told them it was too much.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.447
Hello.

19:57.948 --> 19:59.992
Hello, Howard.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.535
Come on, say it.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.329
Bunny seemed upset
that we moved the cage,

20:04.329 --> 20:07.082
but Mrs. Gambolini needed
to be at the party, right?

20:07.082 --> 20:09.626
- You're a very lonely man,
aren't you, Howard?

20:09.626 --> 20:11.128
- Excuse me.

20:12.421 --> 20:15.924
- So, Amy Schumer started
renovating the penthouse

20:15.924 --> 20:18.343
without all the necessary permits.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.720
Thoughts?

20:19.720 --> 20:22.389
- Ooh, I love her. She's so dirty.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.099
I heard it was very Z Gallerie

20:24.099 --> 20:27.978
circa '92 in Sting's place,
so anything's better than that.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.814
- Are we really doing business?
It's your last day, Bunny.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.942
- We also need to sort out
the Kono apartment.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.736
And now, Jan Bellows', too.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.155
- Bunny. I'm already drunk.

20:38.155 --> 20:40.073
- I'm ready to take the minutes.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.701
- Bunny, I'll handle all this
at the next meeting.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.036
- But we can do it now.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.454
- It's your last day...

20:45.454 --> 20:46.622
- Stop saying that!

20:52.085 --> 20:53.378
- What's wrong?

20:53.378 --> 20:54.880
- I, uh...

20:57.216 --> 21:00.344
I... I've changed my mind.

21:00.344 --> 21:03.180
I'm not stepping down. Sorry.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.516
- Well, great.
What about all my decorations?

21:05.516 --> 21:07.726
- So, Amy Schumer's renovation...

21:07.726 --> 21:09.520
- Bunny. We had a plan.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.147
Today's your last day.
This was <i>your</i> decision.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.649
You said...

21:13.649 --> 21:15.317
Howard, what did she say?

21:16.902 --> 21:20.656
- At November's meeting, you,
wearing a fuchsia number, said--

21:20.656 --> 21:22.282
- Don't quote me from the minutes.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.493
- Howard.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.958
- "I can't do this forever.

21:30.958 --> 21:34.419
"We should pick a new Board President.
And I think Nina Lin

21:34.419 --> 21:37.464
is the person best equipped
to carry on my legacy."

21:38.632 --> 21:40.259
- And I still think that.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.011
But not yet.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.680
We rushed this.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.723
There's more I can still teach you.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.977
- Let's not pretend this is about me.

21:49.977 --> 21:53.105
This is about you holding
the Arconia hostage until you're dead.

21:53.105 --> 21:55.440
- The Arconia still needs me.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.900
- No, <i>you</i> still need <i>it.</i>

21:56.900 --> 21:58.610
But we can't afford to wait.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.321
The Arconia needs to be brought
into the 21st century.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.531
- What does that mean?

22:02.531 --> 22:04.616
- Made more efficient.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.411
Modernized. <i>Monetized.</i>

22:07.411 --> 22:10.414
- The building needs to be <i>preserved</i>.

22:10.956 --> 22:12.583
Nina, we talked about this.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.960
Or were you just saying
what I wanted to hear?

22:14.960 --> 22:18.088
All the dinners, the long conversations,

22:18.088 --> 22:19.840
our weekly walks?

22:19.840 --> 22:21.258
They were bullshit?

22:21.884 --> 22:24.094
- It's time to step aside.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.473
- You ungrateful bitch.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.225
You ungrateful,

22:30.225 --> 22:32.060
power hungry,

22:32.060 --> 22:34.521
baby bumpy bitch!

22:35.772 --> 22:37.274
- Alright, fine.

22:37.274 --> 22:39.276
I didn't want to do this
in front of everyone.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.153
- Oh, you don't have to...
- No, no, no, please don't...

22:41.153 --> 22:43.322
- The only reason you're Board President

22:43.322 --> 22:44.907
is because your mom was Board President.

22:44.907 --> 22:46.825
Yet you can't fathom the idea

22:46.825 --> 22:48.827
of someone else being
able to do what you do.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.997
You are so selfish and self-important

22:51.997 --> 22:53.373
and stuck in the past.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.709
You're a relic, Bunny!

22:55.709 --> 22:58.170
And I can't allow this building
to become one, too.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.089
- You have no idea

23:01.089 --> 23:03.175
what this job takes.

23:03.175 --> 23:05.135
The pressures I endure

23:05.135 --> 23:07.346
on a daily basis.

23:09.056 --> 23:11.350
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.894
- I'm not going to let you stop me.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.863
- Our last piece of evidence.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.407
Howard's minutes.
Okay.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.535
Who do we think killed Bunny?

23:29.535 --> 23:32.788
Well, we know that
she threatened to paddle our superfans,

23:32.788 --> 23:34.581
who I love. They're just a little off.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.583
- Ooh, you never want to upset a fan base.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.377
- She also threatened to fire Lester,

23:38.377 --> 23:39.837
but he thinks that was just a joke.

23:39.837 --> 23:43.131
- Ooh. A little <i>Upstairs, Downstairs.</i>
It's a possibility.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.343
- You said you saw her at the Pickle Diner
with a brochure of Florida.

23:46.343 --> 23:49.304
- Was she going on the run?
Was she meeting a lover in Florida?

23:50.347 --> 23:52.850
What? We missed the lover angle
in season one. I'm reaching.

23:52.850 --> 23:54.560
- And lastly, she went back on her word

23:54.560 --> 23:56.895
and wouldn't give
the board presidency to Nina.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.940
That feels like a biggie.
We need to find out more about Nina.

24:00.691 --> 24:02.484
- So...

24:02.484 --> 24:04.736
that gives us a new prime suspect.

24:05.737 --> 24:09.491
- Ooh. Did the pregnant protégé
make a pernicious power play?

24:09.491 --> 24:13.078
Wow, I am on fire!

24:13.078 --> 24:16.874
You know, I really think
that I've leveled up since Tim's murder.

24:29.261 --> 24:30.846
- What?

24:30.846 --> 24:32.431
Nothing to say to me?

24:34.141 --> 24:37.144
You think I'm some stubborn relic, too?

24:54.203 --> 24:55.913
- Oh, shit. Are we being too loud?

24:55.913 --> 24:57.956
- No. Not too loud.

24:57.956 --> 25:01.210
- Mabel, who is-- Oh, Bunny.

25:01.210 --> 25:04.129
- Charles. Oliver.
- Oh. Hi.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.465
- Um, if you're celebrating,

25:06.465 --> 25:08.842
you should have proper champagne.

25:09.510 --> 25:12.471
Something nicer than
your bottom-shelf blend.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.681
- Thank you so much!

25:14.681 --> 25:17.684
- Well, you saved the Arconia.

25:18.352 --> 25:21.271
Maybe through sheer dumb luck,
but the result was the same.

25:22.648 --> 25:23.690
I, um,

25:24.233 --> 25:26.235
don't think I've said it yet, so...

25:27.236 --> 25:28.362
thank you.

25:28.904 --> 25:31.823
- Aw, Bunny, you're too kind.

25:33.325 --> 25:36.078
Oh, and w-we have a gift for you,
too. Um...

25:36.078 --> 25:37.329
There you are.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.540
Your very own merch.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.583
Try it on.

25:42.584 --> 25:46.046
- This is the last thing I want
from you assholes.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.173
- Ah, come on!
- Try it on.

25:49.675 --> 25:51.343
- Oh, alright, alright.

25:52.970 --> 25:55.222
- Ooh...
- Wow.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.724
- Already lookin' foxy.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.727
- Ooh.
- Wow, Bunny!

26:00.727 --> 26:03.188
- Yeah. You know,
it's actually quite fetching.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.398
- Hm?

26:04.398 --> 26:06.775
- I was at Woodstock, you know.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.694
- Oh, groovy.

26:08.694 --> 26:10.529
Well, thank you for the bubbly.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.155
And you get home safe now, you hear?

26:12.155 --> 26:13.323
Bye-bye.
- Okay. Bye.

26:16.243 --> 26:17.494
Wait.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.121
Do you think...

26:20.163 --> 26:21.832
Did she want to join?

26:23.834 --> 26:25.210
- No.

26:25.544 --> 26:27.671
And we don't want that, right?

26:30.174 --> 26:33.302
Oh god. Guys, she's still out there.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.304
What?

26:36.638 --> 26:37.931
Oh...

26:40.434 --> 26:42.853
What do we do now? This is so awkward.

26:42.853 --> 26:44.646
- And more than a little creepy.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.075
- Oh my god, she's crying.

26:57.576 --> 26:59.620
- Okay, seriously,
what is going on with this woman?

27:01.747 --> 27:02.956
- Wow.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.882
- Did not peg Bunny for a wailer.

27:11.882 --> 27:13.800
- We have to invite her in, right?

27:13.800 --> 27:15.719
- No, no, we can't now.
It's so out of pity.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.012
- We have to.

27:18.972 --> 27:20.265
Hey, Bunny?

27:26.605 --> 27:27.731
Hm...

27:30.275 --> 27:32.528
- So, I guess everything's okay then?

27:32.528 --> 27:35.155
- What if she comes back, though?

27:35.155 --> 27:38.450
- Maybe we move this party
somewhere more private?

27:39.535 --> 27:42.246
- To the roof.
- To the roof.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.085
<i>We at</i> Only Murders

27:48.085 --> 27:50.796
<i>did not kill Bunny Folger.</i>

27:50.796 --> 27:53.257
<i>But there's a chance
we could have saved her life</i>

27:53.257 --> 27:55.551
<i>with a simple act of kindness.</i>

28:11.733 --> 28:14.236
And one more toast to Mabel.

28:14.236 --> 28:15.946
To Mabel Mora.

28:15.946 --> 28:17.239
- Ah!
- Oh, sorry.

28:17.948 --> 28:20.993
<i>If Bunny acted
like she knew better than you,</i>

28:20.993 --> 28:22.911
<i>it's probably because she did.</i>

28:23.745 --> 28:26.081
<i>Just got off the phone
with Jimmy down at the docks.</i>

28:27.040 --> 28:28.834
<i>I know who did it.</i>
- I know who did it.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.711
I know who did it.

28:30.711 --> 28:33.088
<i>She was a New York classic.</i>

28:33.088 --> 28:35.215
<i>A treasure trove of stories,</i>

28:35.215 --> 28:37.384
<i>secrets, and forgotten wisdom.</i>

28:37.384 --> 28:41.221
- Does anyone else feel like
there's still a couple of loose ends?

28:41.221 --> 28:43.098
- Loose ends?

28:43.098 --> 28:45.559
- Hm, I don't know.
Maybe it's just a feeling.

28:47.352 --> 28:50.564
<i>Bunny always put the Arconia first.</i>

28:50.564 --> 28:53.442
- Too late! I don't wanna hang out!

28:53.442 --> 28:55.527
<i>I want you to call your sister Gladys.</i>

28:56.153 --> 28:58.155
<i>And that didn't always make her popular...</i>

28:59.656 --> 29:01.325
<i>even among the people she cared for.</i>

29:01.325 --> 29:02.951
<i>We've run out of champagne.</i>

29:02.951 --> 29:05.495
- Mm. I will get some from my apartment.

29:05.495 --> 29:07.039
- Ah.
- Thank you, ma'am!

29:07.581 --> 29:08.832
- Yep.

29:12.002 --> 29:13.295
- What the fuck do you want?

29:14.004 --> 29:16.006
No! Let go of me!

29:16.006 --> 29:18.884
Let go of me! What are you doing?!

29:21.887 --> 29:23.096
Help me!
