-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.133 --> 00:36.200
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.767
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.800 --> 00:40.633
in a court of law.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.233
-My father's been
with this agency
for almost 40 years now.

00:45.267 --> 00:46.900
He's actually
the colonel of patrol,

00:46.933 --> 00:48.533
so he's my boss now.

00:48.567 --> 00:49.767
When I graduated
the academy,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.267
he actually came up
and pinned the badge

00:52.300 --> 00:53.867
that we wore
when he was a deputy

00:53.900 --> 00:55.800
on my uniform, and actually
it's the same badge

00:55.833 --> 00:57.300
that I wear today, so...

00:57.333 --> 00:58.533
We get to go
on calls together

00:58.567 --> 01:00.367
and there I am,
20-something years later

01:00.400 --> 01:02.400
wearing his badge
and backing him up.

01:02.433 --> 01:03.967
It's pretty fun.
-(police radio chatter)

01:04.067 --> 01:06.867
-Right now we're going
to some neighbors.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.400
A neighbor called in
and said that his wife

01:09.433 --> 01:12.167
is being beat
by another woman,

01:12.200 --> 01:14.333
so we're gonna go see
if we can help out.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.367
23-43, place me 97.
What's going on?

01:18.400 --> 01:19.933
-I don't know,
but I don't know
what he's on.

01:19.967 --> 01:22.467
-Okay, okay.
Where is he at?
Up there on the left?

01:22.500 --> 01:23.667
-Yeah, he's down here
on the street.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.067
-Okay. All right,
What's he wearing?

01:25.067 --> 01:27.367
-He's wearing red shorts
and not a shirt.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.567
-Is he hurting you?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.167
-He was.
-Okay. All right.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.500
-(police radio chatter)
-Hang tight for me, okay?

01:34.067 --> 01:37.200
-(police radio chatter)

01:38.967 --> 01:41.833
-23-43. Keep me 94.
Step it up.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.200
-(door opens)

01:43.233 --> 01:45.500
-(police radio chatter)

01:45.533 --> 01:48.833
-Sir, get on the ground.
-(man yells)

01:48.867 --> 01:50.433
-Put your hands
on the side.

01:50.467 --> 01:51.767
Don't move!

01:52.767 --> 01:54.067
Don't move!

01:56.267 --> 01:58.667
-(speaking indistinctly)

01:58.700 --> 02:00.067
-Don't move.
-My arms are up!

02:00.067 --> 02:02.067
-Stay on the ground!
-Yes, sir!

02:02.100 --> 02:03.533
Yes, sir!

02:03.567 --> 02:05.600
-Put your hands behind
your back right now.
Do it now.

02:05.633 --> 02:07.967
Put your hands
behind your back!
Do it now!

02:08.067 --> 02:09.600
-Yes, sir.

02:09.633 --> 02:11.300
I'm flying.

02:11.333 --> 02:14.367
Oh, yeah, I am good.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.533
Sir!

02:15.567 --> 02:17.767
-Are you on
any medication right now?
-No, sir!

02:17.800 --> 02:19.067
-You take any drugs
or anything?

02:19.067 --> 02:20.867
-I have taken some
little bit of drugs.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.500
-What'd you have?
-Some marijuana, sir.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.600
-You're under the influence
of marijuana right now?
-Yes, sir!

02:24.633 --> 02:27.800
-Okay. What's going on tonight?
What's your name?

02:27.833 --> 02:29.167
-My name is Richard.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.733
-Your name is Richard?
-Yes, sir.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.300
-Why are you naked
right now, Richard?

02:32.333 --> 02:34.500
-That man was trying
to come up in my house

02:34.533 --> 02:36.067
and I felt like
it was a threat

02:36.067 --> 02:38.833
for anybody that
I felt like was my family!

02:38.867 --> 02:39.867
Come up in my house--

02:39.900 --> 02:41.067
-Stop moving around.
Relax.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.467
-No, sir, I'm pissed...
-Richard, relax.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.733
-...the (bleep) off.
-Relax.

02:43.767 --> 02:45.500
Can you sit up?
-No, sir.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.200
-"Yes, sir" or "no, sir"?
-Yes, sir.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.700
I'm saying "no, sir"
because he was not coming
to my house. No.

02:49.733 --> 02:51.133
-You've only had
marijuana tonight?

02:51.167 --> 02:53.233
-Not in the house.
Yes, sir, no.

02:53.267 --> 02:54.833
-He's, uh, naked.
-(speaking indistinctly)

02:54.867 --> 02:56.367
Um, I'd glove.
-I did. Hey.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.067
I hit a bubble
then that bowl.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.567
-He's bleeding?
-No, he's not bleeding.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.900
He's just on something.

03:01.933 --> 03:03.667
He said he's on marijuana, but--

03:03.700 --> 03:05.600
-No, I did--
I did hit some meth.

03:05.633 --> 03:07.400
No, sir, I did
hit some meth.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.067
-You did some meth?
-Yeah, it was like two hits.

03:09.067 --> 03:11.067
I'll tell you right now,
it had nothing to do with that.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.700
-How long ago did you--
-I'm on two hits.

03:12.733 --> 03:14.800
About 30 minutes ago.
Right before you came up.

03:14.833 --> 03:17.133
She fired up a bubble
and we (bleep) hit it

03:17.167 --> 03:18.700
a couple times,
and that dude tried to come up

03:18.733 --> 03:19.967
in the (bleep) house.
Hell no!

03:20.067 --> 03:21.767
-Relax. Relax.
-No. 'Cause it was her (bleep)

03:21.800 --> 03:23.467
No, yes, sir,
I will relax.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.233
It was her.
If I'm bleeding,
'cause I rushed out that house.

03:26.267 --> 03:28.700
-He's claiming there's a guy,
but she came up to me

03:28.733 --> 03:30.133
so I think we got
a good 31.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.333
-Can you please
listen to me?

03:31.367 --> 03:32.700
Can you please
listen to me?
-We're listening.

03:32.733 --> 03:33.933
We're trying to listen
to you, okay?

03:33.967 --> 03:35.333
But you need to listen
to us first, okay?

03:35.367 --> 03:36.533
-We're gonna stand up,
okay Richard?

03:36.567 --> 03:38.400
-No, sir, yes, sir.
-All right. One, two, three.

03:38.433 --> 03:39.900
-Please have mercy...

03:39.933 --> 03:44.167
(speaking indistinctly)

03:44.200 --> 03:45.600
-Pat him down briefly.

03:45.633 --> 03:46.767
-I been mowin'.
I been mowin'.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.133
Somebody call Brian!

03:49.167 --> 03:50.233
-Come on.
Come on, Richard.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.367
-Yes, sir.
Don't search me fully.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.667
No, y'all not gonna--
-Let's go.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.067
-You're gonna take
my shoes off?

03:55.067 --> 03:56.733
I'm not going into that car
until that car's searched.

03:56.767 --> 03:57.900
-We're gonna sit down.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.100
-Well, I ain't going
in that car!
-Richard.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.333
-No! No!
-Here you wanna put him--

04:03.367 --> 04:05.800
-Search the car!
-No, we're sitting down.

04:05.833 --> 04:07.467
-No-- no tasers!

04:07.500 --> 04:09.300
All my neighbors are pussies!

04:09.333 --> 04:11.133
-Okay, relax.
-I want a lawyer!

04:11.167 --> 04:13.633
-Richard, we're gonna have
EMS check you out, okay?

04:13.667 --> 04:15.333
-Let's just lean him up.
Just to sit you up.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.100
-All right. Okay.
-That's all we're doing.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.500
Go ahead and scoot back for me.
-Sit back on the tire
right here.

04:19.533 --> 04:22.267
-I swear, please do not (bleep)
do nothing that I feel like
is a threat.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.233
I don't want a threat done
to me, okay?

04:24.267 --> 04:26.067
I just feel like
I'm being threatened right now

04:26.067 --> 04:28.067
'cause y'all, man,
you're all in my space.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.933
I like arm distances
and stuff because I feel
like it's threats.

04:30.967 --> 04:32.567
This is my beliefs.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.333
-Hey.
-I have the right
to feel this way.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.233
-Hey, relax.
-You are a threat!

04:36.267 --> 04:38.967
I will. You are my--
you are a police officer.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.267
-Okay.
-I am respecting you.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.967
-Okay.
-Because you do fight
for people's rights.

04:42.067 --> 04:43.367
-Listen for me. Listen.
-Would you do it?

04:43.400 --> 04:44.700
-Listen to me.
-Would you do
what I did?

04:44.733 --> 04:46.367
-I don't know
what happened yet, okay?
-Okay.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.133
-What I'm gonna do though,
I'm gonna let you know

04:48.167 --> 04:51.067
the paramedics are gonna come
and just check you out
real quick, okay?

04:51.067 --> 04:53.067
-I feel like
they're not a threat.
-Okay.

04:53.067 --> 04:54.867
-As long as they're not
trying to contain me

04:54.900 --> 04:58.067
against my rights
to fight for my family!

04:58.100 --> 05:01.400
I feel like everybody right now
is a little bit of a threat!

05:01.433 --> 05:03.867
-Okay.
-A man came to my house,
I felt not safe.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.933
-He said marijuana,
did two hits of meth earlier.
-He was not!

05:06.967 --> 05:09.400
-Now, I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

05:09.433 --> 05:11.667
-Marijuana and some meth?
-Meth! Yes, sir!

05:11.700 --> 05:13.867
-All right.
-a little bit of cocaine
the other night! No, sir!

05:13.900 --> 05:16.167
-Let's get you over
to the hospital.
Let 'em check you out, okay?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.533
-But I sleep everyday.
-We're gonna get you
up on the stretch--

05:18.567 --> 05:20.767
-Now, I want you all
to take my vitals
and everything right now.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.067
I'm angry, no, sir!

05:22.067 --> 05:24.133
-We're gonna have to sit
on this stretcher, okay?

05:24.167 --> 05:27.600
-Real slow! Real slow!
-We're going slow.
Have a seat.

05:27.633 --> 05:30.100
-Real slow. No, sir.
-Here we go, here we go.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.600
-No! Sir!
-We're gonna lay you back.
Sit back.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.100
-Are you okay, ma'am?
-Kind of sort of all right.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.800
-Okay, well, let's have
the paramedics check you out
while they're here, okay?

05:38.833 --> 05:40.067
All right, what happened?

05:40.067 --> 05:42.933
-I was inside
doing the dishes,
he came over,

05:42.967 --> 05:44.500
and him and his girlfriend
got in a fight.

05:44.533 --> 05:45.667
And he's got a little baby.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.133
-Okay.
-Okay, and I guess
he smoked some spice

05:48.167 --> 05:50.100
'cause I came out and said,
"What is that funny smell?"

05:50.133 --> 05:52.400
He said, "I smoked some spice,"
and next thing I know
he flipped out.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.833
I said, "Why did you smoke
that (bleep)? That's crazy."
-Mm-hmm.

05:54.867 --> 05:57.133
After you confronted him
about the spice, what happened
after that?

05:57.167 --> 05:59.633
-He came in the house
and then the next thing I know,

05:59.667 --> 06:01.067
he just flipped
the (bleep) out.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.600
-What do you mean by that?
-Just grabbing me

06:02.633 --> 06:04.400
and telling me
that I'm his family,

06:04.433 --> 06:07.067
that I'm his wife, and then
he sexually assaulted me

06:07.100 --> 06:08.567
in front of the next door
neighbor's yard.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.933
-Okay.
-You know, he didn't smell
normal to me.

06:10.967 --> 06:13.600
-And you said he kind of
grabbed you and held you.
Where did he grab you at?

06:13.633 --> 06:16.167
-He grabbed me right here.
He touched my chest.
-Okay. Okay.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.600
-Probably gonna bruise
by tomorrow, but--
-Okay. Did he grab you

06:18.633 --> 06:20.600
kind of like pushing you
or pulling you towards him?

06:20.633 --> 06:22.100
-He pulled me towards him,
tried to hug me,

06:22.133 --> 06:24.333
trying to hold me,
pushing me down
on the ground.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.333
I had to get my dogs
back in the house, and...

06:26.367 --> 06:27.700
I got four big dogs.

06:27.733 --> 06:28.900
-How long have you known him?

06:28.933 --> 06:30.367
-I've known him about a year.
-About a year?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.200
Has he ever acted
like this before?
-No, never ever.

06:32.233 --> 06:34.567
-You ever known him to be
on any kind of spice
or anything like that?

06:34.600 --> 06:36.067
-No, never. Nothing.
-Okay.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.100
-Never.
Never seen him like that.

06:38.133 --> 06:41.233
He's a gentlemen.
He's just a sweetheart actually.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.767
-Okay.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.833
-Is he okay yet? I mean--
-Yeah, he's just gonna go
to the hospital

06:44.867 --> 06:46.067
and get checked out
for now, okay?

06:46.067 --> 06:47.867
-Putting me in a vehicle?
I ain't give a (bleep).

06:47.900 --> 06:50.467
I ain't see, I ain't see
my shoes and my belt.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.067
-The victim was telling me
that there was some spice
involved too apparently.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.667
-He was saying
he hit the bowl, so--
-Yeah.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.433
-Well, he's got
the battery charges
we know of.

06:56.467 --> 06:58.733
-Yep.
-Okay, so maybe
some lewd and lascivious

06:58.767 --> 07:00.433
for touching her.
-Yeah, possibly. Mm-hmm.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.233
-Obviously being out naked
is never-- never a good mix.

07:03.267 --> 07:05.700
-He's gonna get more
smacked in for the drug use

07:05.733 --> 07:08.067
and being on products.
There's no way
he should be out, no.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.467
-Yeah, he can't take care
of himself.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.233
It's bad enough when
you have one drug on board.

07:11.267 --> 07:13.067
-You mix all three--
-Yeah, can you imagine?

07:16.100 --> 07:18.200
-I've been in this line of work
for close to 13 years

07:18.233 --> 07:21.400
and the excitement, the thrill
of certain calls you go to,

07:21.433 --> 07:22.533
it's fantastic.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.067
So, I don't call in sick
'cause I'm afraid

07:25.100 --> 07:26.500
I'm gonna miss something good.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.833
Getting up and coming to work,
it's not like having a job.

07:28.867 --> 07:30.700
This is like getting paid
to have fun.

07:30.733 --> 07:32.500
-(police radio chatter)

07:32.533 --> 07:34.667
-Hmm. No seatbelt passenger.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.133
308. 10-31.

07:36.167 --> 07:37.267
-Woman on radio:
08. Go ahead.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.733
-A silver Saturn.
W and about... make it Hatton.

07:39.767 --> 07:40.967
-Near W and Hatton.

07:41.067 --> 07:42.600
-288 en route.

07:42.633 --> 07:43.967
-Car 288.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.233
-(door opens)
-Man on radio: 288.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.600
34. I can get there.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.633
-10-4. Car 3... 308
is requesting you.

07:52.867 --> 07:54.133
-Get to it.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.100
-How you doing?
Deputy Sheriff's Office.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.433
I was behind ya.
You didn't have
your seatbelt on.

07:58.467 --> 07:59.900
Any particular reason?

08:00.067 --> 08:02.167
-She's about to take me
to the store and that's it.
-Okay.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.633
You forget
to put it on? Okay.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.233
-I was just coming
to get me a water.

08:06.267 --> 08:07.533
-Okay. You got
any I.D. on you?

08:07.567 --> 08:08.767
You got any I.D.
on you, sir?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.733
-(police radio chatter)
-Sit tight for me.

08:14.067 --> 08:17.067
-Man on radio:
Well, I'll send you a case
number on this traffic stop.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.167
-Woman on radio:
10-4.

08:21.233 --> 08:22.467
-Anything illegal
in the car?

08:22.500 --> 08:23.833
-Woman on radio: 4-28.
-No, sir.

08:23.867 --> 08:25.500
-When's the last time
you smoked marijuana?

08:25.533 --> 08:27.100
-Golly.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.233
Hey, cop, you want me
to step out?

08:29.267 --> 08:30.333
I ain't got nothing, man.

08:30.367 --> 08:31.900
-I smell the odor
of marijuana.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.633
-We're just coming
to the store. That's all.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.067
-Let me get you to step out.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.500
-I ain't got nothing.

08:36.533 --> 08:38.400
-Nothing that's gonna poke,
stick, or cut me?

08:38.433 --> 08:39.967
-No, man.
-No?

08:40.067 --> 08:41.633
-I ain't got no weed.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.533
-Really?
-Come on, man.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.567
-Now, don't reach in there.
It ain't going nowhere.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.267
It's tucked in there securely.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.767
If you say
you don't have any,

08:48.800 --> 08:51.167
you wouldn't let
the plastic bag hang out.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.567
I mean, at least
you could tuck it in.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.433
It's a little piece of a joint,
so that's it.

08:56.467 --> 08:58.233
-You keep a joint
in a piece of bag?

08:58.267 --> 08:59.400
-I'm just saying, man.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.300
Y'all pulled us over, man.
That's it.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.067
-Well, look--
-(mumbles) Golly!

09:04.100 --> 09:06.167
-I don't want to reach
in your butt-crack
and pull it out.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.700
-I will do it for you then.
-No, look, pull-- that's--

09:08.733 --> 09:10.833
-Look. A little joint.
-Okay.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.700
Put it up here
on the hood of the car.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.433
That's all that's in there?

09:14.467 --> 09:17.200
-Man, you're finna make
me get out here
and get butt naked?

09:17.233 --> 09:18.567
-No. No, not over that.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.067
-Golly!

09:21.133 --> 09:23.133
-Well, you still
got bag in there.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.700
-I still got bag in--
-I just pulled

09:24.733 --> 09:26.567
a piece of bag
out of your crack.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.833
You don't have
anything else in there?

09:27.867 --> 09:30.133
-No, sir. How you pull
a bag out my crack?

09:30.167 --> 09:31.733
-You got something else
up there.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.500
There we go.

09:33.533 --> 09:36.233
(chuckles)
I knew there was more to it.

09:36.267 --> 09:37.733
You still got bag in there.

09:37.767 --> 09:39.733
-Man, I ain't still
got more bag in there.
-Yeah, you do.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.367
-Come on, you going
all in my asshole.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.067
-Well, you're hiding
dope in there.
-I'm ready to go to jail, man.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.167
Take me to jail, man.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.633
You're gonna take me.
You can cuff my hands.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.067
Pulling my ass out
and all like this.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.367
Man, come on.
-Well, you got it
hanging out of your crack.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.300
-Man, come on though, sir.
First of all,

09:52.333 --> 09:53.967
you talked to us
about a seatbelt.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.067
Now you all
in my ass, man.
Come on, man.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.267
-You had dope
in your crack.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.100
-I'm ready to go, sir.
-What's that?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.200
You got plastic bag
hanging out.

10:02.233 --> 10:04.967
I can't help it that
you didn't tuck it
in there deep enough.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It's not my problem.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.500
-(police radio chatter)

10:08.533 --> 10:10.733
-Is that all you got
in the car?
-That-- Listen,

10:10.767 --> 10:12.667
she was bringing me
up here to the store.
That's it.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.133
Ain't nothing else
in the car.

10:14.167 --> 10:16.000
-I'm trying to work with you.
-Yeah, ain't nothing in there.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.000
-But when I make contact
at the window,

10:18.033 --> 10:20.067
I can smell it, all right?
-Okay. I understand.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.133
-And I pull you out
and ask you,
"Do you have anything?"

10:22.167 --> 10:23.500
You say, "No."
-Mm-hmm.

10:23.533 --> 10:27.600
-And then the first thing I see
is about four or five inches

10:27.633 --> 10:29.767
of plastic bag hanging
out of your butt crack.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.267
At that point,
it's pretty evident that--

10:32.300 --> 10:34.933
-But it ain't like
it was no bag full of crack.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.433
A little weed?
-I didn't say it was
a bag full of crack.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.633
But don't tell me that
you don't have anything

10:39.667 --> 10:41.467
when you got
plastic bag hanging out.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.433
-Yes, sir. You're right.
I shouldn't have lied.
-You know?

10:43.467 --> 10:45.367
Or you should have
tucked it in a little better.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.867
-You're right, sir.
You're right.
-Right?

10:46.900 --> 10:48.733
-You're right, sir.
-Sit tight for me.

10:48.767 --> 10:50.567
-Woman on radio:
10-5 by car 16.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.400
-Yeah, I asked her
to step out.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.367
-She's bringing me
to the store. That's all.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.733
She ain't got
nothing, man.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.367
I'm not gonna throw nothing
in her car though

10:57.400 --> 10:58.467
that's mine though.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.667
I ain't want to
get her in trouble,

10:59.700 --> 11:01.167
I ain't want to
get in trouble.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.467
They're gonna be
leaving in here
in a minute anyway, so.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.667
-What's your name, man?
-Jamarius.

11:05.700 --> 11:06.967
-Jamarius.
-Yes, sir.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.100
-All right. You do realize
that you're going to jail.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.233
If you have anything else on you
and you take it into jail,

11:11.267 --> 11:13.367
it's an introduction charge.
-I ain't got nothing. That's it.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.067
You ain't got nothing else
on you? Okay.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.433
We almost done?

11:18.467 --> 11:21.567
-(sighs) Well, he's got
a failure to appear,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.067
so I really can't do
much for him.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.067
So, I guess I'm gonna go
break the bad news to him

11:26.067 --> 11:27.933
and he's gotta go tonight.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.500
-Okay.
-I'll go let him know.

11:29.533 --> 11:32.067
-Jamarius, when
was the last time
you were in trouble?

11:32.100 --> 11:33.833
-September.
I just got out of prison.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.133
-For what?
-For robbery.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.867
-Are you on paper?
-No, no.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.100
No probation.
-No?

11:39.133 --> 11:41.267
-Straight up time?
-Yeah, straight up time.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.100
-How long did you go
to prison for?

11:43.133 --> 11:44.967
-Seven years.
-Seven years? For robbery?

11:45.067 --> 11:46.667
-Well, good news
and bad news.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.433
Good news is
it's just a misdemeanor.

11:48.467 --> 11:49.800
Okay?

11:49.833 --> 11:51.500
Bad news is,
you got caught.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.867
-Yeah, I feel that.
And that's like
I just told him,

11:53.900 --> 11:55.733
I'm a man though.
Did what I could've did.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.233
I could've been greedy
and throw that in her car.

11:58.267 --> 12:00.400
She got her babies
in there though.
But guess what though?

12:00.433 --> 12:02.233
That's mine. I smoke weed.
That's mine.
-Okay.

12:02.267 --> 12:03.800
-I ain't trippin'.
-I respect the fact

12:03.833 --> 12:05.167
that you stand up,
take it like a man.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.133
-I ain't trippin'.
I ain't trippin'.
-All right.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.433
You still living
on Hernandez?

12:09.467 --> 12:11.700
-My granny's house, yep.
-All right, Jamarius.

12:11.733 --> 12:13.700
-I ain't trippin'.
-Looks like you're gonna

12:13.733 --> 12:15.500
be taking a ride
for the booty dope tonight.

12:15.533 --> 12:16.767
Turn around for me.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.367
Make sure these
don't cinch down on you.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.300
-Hey, I mean, I can't lie.
I tried to hide it.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.567
I can't lie,
know what I'm saying? Hey.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.467
-Um, I guess if you're gonna
hide it in there,

12:26.500 --> 12:28.600
you might want to tuck
all the plastic in.

12:28.633 --> 12:29.800
-Yes, sir.
-Fair enough?

12:29.833 --> 12:31.800
-Have you ever had
any failure to appears?

12:31.833 --> 12:33.067
-No, sir.
-Never?

12:33.067 --> 12:34.400
-Go to court every time?
-Go to court.

12:34.433 --> 12:37.067
-All right, step back here
to my car.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.067
I was trying my hardest
to work, you know?

12:39.100 --> 12:41.700
For me, honesty goes
a long ways, all right?
-I understand.

12:41.733 --> 12:43.167
Have a seat.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.600
-From the get-go,
you stood up like a man.

12:45.633 --> 12:48.133
Unfortunate part is,
had part of the bag hanging out.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.300
-Yes, sir.
-As funny as it is, you know.

12:51.333 --> 12:55.100
So now you just didn't have
enough time to tuck it in
I guess, right? So--

12:55.133 --> 12:58.067
-You know, man, God got
everything planned for a reason.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.567
It's all good, man.
-Well...

13:00.600 --> 13:03.700
-My granny--
-It could be worse.
It ain't the end of the world.

13:03.733 --> 13:06.300
-She's gonna be pissed.
-It ain't like you got caught
with a gun or anything.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.333
Just a little bit of weed,
so you can go for possession

13:08.367 --> 13:10.133
of marijuana,
less than 20 grams, all right?

13:10.167 --> 13:11.533
We'll get you down there, man,

13:11.567 --> 13:13.467
you'll bond out, and get this
taken care of, all right, buddy?

13:13.500 --> 13:14.500
-Yes, sir.
-All right, man.

13:14.533 --> 13:15.600
-All right.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.900
Here's your license.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.767
He's gonna be going to jail
for possession of marijuana

13:21.800 --> 13:23.067
less than 20 grams, okay?

13:23.067 --> 13:24.967
And he wants to turn
all of his property over to you.

13:25.067 --> 13:27.300
I didn't low-bond
but tonight he's gotta
ride for that one,

13:27.333 --> 13:29.533
You'll be able to get him out
with $100, all right?

13:29.567 --> 13:31.633
Have a good night.
-You too.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.133
-Police work is a serious job
and it's something

13:36.167 --> 13:37.700
that can weigh real,
real heavy on you.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.233
In a short amount of time,
it'll make you old fast,

13:40.267 --> 13:43.300
but I don't know,
we all try and stay lighthearted

13:43.333 --> 13:45.100
and joke around
when we can,

13:45.133 --> 13:46.633
which we can't always do,

13:46.667 --> 13:48.633
but when you can,
it's good to laugh.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.900
It'll help keep you young
and keep you sane.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.767
-Didn't signal
within 100.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.700
Speeding on Plains.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.100
-Just had a vehicle leave

13:59.133 --> 14:01.067
one of the gaming
establishments here

14:01.067 --> 14:02.833
we have a lot of
narcotic problems with.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.567
So, we're gonna initiate
a traffic stop,

14:04.600 --> 14:06.067
see what his hurry is.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.867
And he's expired.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.333
-(police radio chatter)

14:14.367 --> 14:16.800
-Hey, I'm Corporal Vigil.
You got your driver's license

14:16.833 --> 14:17.933
and insurance, sir?

14:17.967 --> 14:20.400
-Yeah. Um...
I don't have insurance.

14:20.433 --> 14:22.067
-You don't have insurance
on the vehicle?

14:22.100 --> 14:23.100
-No, sir.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.833
This is actually
my brother's car though.

14:24.867 --> 14:26.767
I'm sorry.
-Okay, hop out
of the car, man.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.933
-Hey, Heath--
I'm talking to my boss. I just--

14:28.967 --> 14:30.733
-Okay. Get out of the car.
-Okay.

14:30.767 --> 14:32.233
-Thank you.

14:32.267 --> 14:34.700
-Hey, Heath,
stay on the phone
with me real quick.

14:34.733 --> 14:35.733
-Heath:
Okay.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.267
-I'd drop all that stuff
in your seat.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.600
You're about to go
into handcuffs.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.833
-Got a large knife
on his right hip.
-Why is that? Sir?

14:44.867 --> 14:47.067
-Hop out.
-Why is that? Heath?

14:47.067 --> 14:49.867
-Yeah?
-Hey, I'm going
to jail, Heath.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.333
-Okay. What for?
-Drop your phone.

14:51.367 --> 14:53.367
-I don't know.
What am I going to jail for?
-Drop your phone.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.733
-Okay, okay, well,
let me put my money
in my seat.

14:56.767 --> 14:58.233
-Listen--
-I'm sorry. Hey--

14:58.267 --> 14:59.800
-Dude, you got
a big knife right there.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.533
You got a big knife right there.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.133
-I'm sorry.
-And you keep reaching.

15:03.167 --> 15:05.833
-I'm trying to drop it, okay?

15:05.867 --> 15:08.400
-Because you have
an open container
in your vehicle.

15:08.433 --> 15:09.600
-But that was
from earlier, sir.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.733
-Okay? You've got
expired registration,

15:11.767 --> 15:13.233
you're driving
over the speed limit.

15:13.267 --> 15:15.867
Here, let's hop over here
in front of my pickup truck.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.567
-I think my boss might
still be on the phone.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.067
-That's cool, man.
-Okay.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.300
-You ain't got any weapons
or anything on you?

15:22.333 --> 15:23.867
-No, sir.
-Is it okay to search you?

15:23.900 --> 15:26.600
-You can search me.
-Okay. Who's your boss?

15:26.633 --> 15:28.100
-Uh, his name is Heath.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.967
I'm not too sure
what his last name is.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.567
-Is he for that little
garage shop back there?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.267
-Um, yeah, well,
he's actually the owner.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.233
-Which shop?
Tell me again.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.233
-Oh, it's-- it's that--
what do you call it?

15:40.267 --> 15:43.100
The Amusements Store.

15:46.067 --> 15:48.633
-So the meth pipe's
for the Amusements Store?

15:48.667 --> 15:51.067
-Oh, no, sir. I was--
-Do you smoke meth?

15:51.067 --> 15:52.800
-(police radio chatter)

15:53.867 --> 15:56.100
-The weed, is that
for the Amusements Store?

15:56.133 --> 15:57.767
-No, that's...

16:00.900 --> 16:03.333
-This is where cooperation
is very important.

16:03.367 --> 16:04.967
How much money do you have
in your wallet here?

16:05.067 --> 16:08.100
-I believe two-something
and I have a bunch of ones
in the car.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.433
-Two-something.
So you know about how much
you've got in here, right?

16:10.467 --> 16:13.067
-Probably about a thousand.
-You've got a thousand?

16:13.067 --> 16:15.133
-I think.
Can you count it
for me or no?

16:15.167 --> 16:16.933
-Not right now
we're not gonna.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.967
-Here, take two steps back
for me real quick.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.233
-Thank you.

16:20.267 --> 16:23.833
-And have a seat
on that curb actually
for me also.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.267
Is there anything else crazy
inside your car?

16:27.300 --> 16:29.467
Would you have a problem
with me searching it?

16:29.500 --> 16:32.600
-Well, I needed my money
and stuff. I mean...

16:32.633 --> 16:33.833
-You need money out of it?

16:33.867 --> 16:35.667
But would you have a problem
if I searched your car?

16:35.700 --> 16:37.267
-I-- I don't.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.833
I mean, it's my brother's car.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.333
It's not my car,
so that's okay with me.
you know what I mean?

16:41.367 --> 16:42.867
-But is it okay
if I search it?

16:42.900 --> 16:44.100
You're the one driving it.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.267
-Right.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.900
Just then no.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.200
-You'd rather I wouldn't?

16:48.233 --> 16:50.133
Mkay. Well, here's
what's gonna happen.

16:50.167 --> 16:52.067
I'm going to search
your vehicle anyway

16:52.100 --> 16:55.800
because you were found
in possession of narcotic
paraphernalia, narcotics,

16:55.833 --> 16:59.333
and also you got beer
and stuff like that
in the vehicle, okay?

16:59.367 --> 17:00.533
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.233
Hang tight for me,
all right, my man?

17:02.267 --> 17:05.300
So since he was leaving
that slots business,

17:05.333 --> 17:06.933
we're looking out
for anymore drugs

17:06.967 --> 17:09.333
or large amounts of cash.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.600
He said he's the worker
and just shut it down.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.800
All these sweets.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.867
He's saying this black bag
isn't his either,

17:19.900 --> 17:23.133
so there's probably gonna be
some decent stuff in here.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.267
-He was really nervous.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.767
His hands were soaking wet
and sweaty.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.500
-So it looks like we've got
some more paraphernalia here

17:31.533 --> 17:35.367
and also some more
crystal methamphetamines.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.567
-Yeah.
-Got a little snort straw
and stuff.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.600
-He's got an awful lot
of money on him.

17:44.067 --> 17:48.167
Just bundles of money
that he had in this bag,

17:48.200 --> 17:49.667
which was in
the passenger seat.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.067
Possibly about
a thousand dollars.

17:52.067 --> 17:54.967
I need to get pictures of that.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.767
-Here's the deal,
all that cash and that,
is that yours?

17:57.800 --> 18:00.300
-That's my personal money.
I've been saving it.

18:00.333 --> 18:04.733
-Okay.
-Um, because I pay myself out
in the ones from our wages.

18:04.767 --> 18:05.933
-Okay.

18:05.967 --> 18:08.233
Well, obviously you had
a little marijuana on you.

18:08.267 --> 18:10.367
and you had
a meth pipe too.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.067
How long have
you been using about?

18:13.733 --> 18:18.900
-Um... weed for like years.

18:18.933 --> 18:19.933
Since high school. And--

18:19.967 --> 18:21.700
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.067
-Dang.

18:23.100 --> 18:26.067
-It's crazy because now
it's like I need it to be okay.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.300
-Sure, no.
-You know?

18:28.300 --> 18:30.200
And, um...

18:30.233 --> 18:34.567
it's like with the other,
I just recently started

18:34.600 --> 18:37.600
using it because I was
working two jobs

18:37.633 --> 18:40.100
before this one and, you know,
trying to make ends meet.

18:40.133 --> 18:43.367
My partner went to prison
and, you know, I just...

18:43.400 --> 18:45.067
needed energy
all the time.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.533
-Just to stay up
for your job and stuff?

18:47.567 --> 18:48.900
I got you, my man.

18:48.933 --> 18:50.800
About how much
do you use a week?

18:50.833 --> 18:52.367
-Don't even know.
-You don't even know?

18:52.400 --> 18:55.067
-It's always different.
It seems like
it's getting worse.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.667
-Man, I know
it's upsetting.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.533
You ain't gotta be upset
right now, all right?

18:58.567 --> 19:00.800
-Like I said,
you've always been
cool to me.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.300
So you had a soda?

19:02.333 --> 19:04.833
-Can I-- Yeah.
I was gonna ask

19:04.867 --> 19:06.467
if I can have a cigarette.
Like, just--

19:06.500 --> 19:07.667
-You got some
in the car?

19:07.700 --> 19:09.067
-I have this one
in my pocket.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.400
-Yeah. Come on, man.

19:10.433 --> 19:11.900
Let's smoke one up.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.067
-Thank you so much.
-No, no sweat, bro.

19:14.067 --> 19:16.500
Like I've said,
you've been cool to me.
I'mma be cool to you.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.567
-I'll get your lighter.
If you want to sit
down out here.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.267
-Just have a seat, man.
-Yeah, just have a seat.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.967
-You understand why
I came over and grabbed you?

19:22.067 --> 19:23.433
You understand why
I did that, right?

19:23.467 --> 19:25.967
-Yeah, you--
-You got that big knife
right there, man.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.067
Your hands were all over it.
-You know, I didn't even re--

19:28.067 --> 19:29.100
-Yeah, I know.
-Sorry.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.467
But listen, you kind of
freaked me out.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.867
You know
my partner's over there.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.967
I just want to make sure
we're cool with that, all right?

19:34.067 --> 19:37.067
-So I'm going to jail, huh?
-Yeah, you're gonna have to
go to jail tonight, okay?

19:37.100 --> 19:40.267
-You're gonna go for possession
of the methamphetamines

19:40.300 --> 19:43.067
and drug paraphernalia, okay?

19:43.067 --> 19:44.400
We're not gonna mess
with the weed,

19:44.433 --> 19:46.100
we're not gonna mess
with the traffic,

19:46.133 --> 19:48.067
or any of that
other stuff, okay?

19:49.533 --> 19:51.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.833
Cover is code three.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.833
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.433 --> 20:06.400
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.433 --> 20:07.600
-(theme music playing)
