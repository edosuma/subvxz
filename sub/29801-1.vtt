I look back now

03:03.350 --> 03:05.584
and it all seems like a dream.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.289
A nightmare, really,

that I have never
quite woken up from.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.300

03:21.302 --> 03:23.235
and I think she always will.

But back then we were just kids

03:30.778 --> 03:32.311
playing a kids' game

- Hey.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.094
She's gonna be okay.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.562
Is she gonna stay this time?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.064
- Why don't you ask me yourself?

08:54.535 --> 08:55.967
(laughing)

- Thank you.

09:02.843 --> 09:03.675
- Give me that.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.309
- Take her box upstairs.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.494
You want some tea?

09:05.495 --> 09:06.678
I just boiled some water.

liked that kid, Reed.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.674
- Oh yeah?

09:35.676 --> 09:37.742
- Yeah, you should call him.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.612
(chuckling)
- Why would I call him?

09:40.614 --> 09:41.813
- Why would anybody call anyone

09:41.815 --> 09:42.914
who cares that way
about someone else?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.983
- Okay, stop, you're crazy.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.651
- I'm just saying
that, you know,

09:46.653 --> 09:48.219
he stuck by you through
a lot of this stuff

09:48.221 --> 09:51.006
and it ain't because
you guys are friends.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.792
- We're close friends but
we've just always been friends.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.759
- [Billy] Yeah.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.594
- Yeah.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.328
- Okay.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.963
Sure, whatever you say but I'd,

09:59.232 --> 10:01.299
I'd suggest you stop
staring at his picture then.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.237
- I just found it in a box.
- All right.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.072
- Just checking it out.
- I believe you.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.640
I believe you.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.874
Good luck with that.

10:09.876 --> 10:10.842
- Can you go away now?

10:10.844 --> 10:11.943

11:53.480 --> 11:55.113
- What're you, crazy?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.315
I would never go through here.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.185
- Yeah, that little dead
girl supposedly haunts it.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.487
- My dad says there's no ghost.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.823
- Oh, well, then
if there's no ghost

12:04.825 --> 12:06.357
why don't you ride through it?

12:06.359 --> 12:07.859
- Don't do it, man.

12:07.861 --> 12:11.396
- Come on, Tommy, don't
make me dare you, please?

- Parents are doing fine.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.863
You probably know
better than I do.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.032
Senior year,

14:27.033 --> 14:29.200
Sally's back, I mean,
what's not to like about it?

14:29.202 --> 14:32.036
Uh, So I was thinking I would
take Sally to school today.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.204
If that's all right with you.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.039
- That's very
sweet of you, Reed.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.941
Isn't that nice, huh, Sally?

14:36.943 --> 14:38.977
(baby crying)
Yeah, she appreciates it.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.178
- Guys, I'll be right back.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.990
This is your last
bit of it, all right?

14:51.992 --> 14:52.624

¶ Disappear ¶

¶ From here ¶

15:29.996 --> 15:31.262

15:32.232 --> 15:33.698
- And she's all over Reed.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.500
- I thought she was
"Mrs. Innocent."

15:36.536 --> 15:38.670
- More like nine months
vacation innocent.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.505
(laughing)

15:40.507 --> 15:44.042

- [Sister Brigit]
These revelations from
the last chapter of

15:56.723 --> 16:00.992
the Bible were given
to and recorded by

16:00.994 --> 16:03.995
the apostle, John,

16:03.997 --> 16:07.999
to warn of the occurrences
that could take place

16:08.001 --> 16:10.001
in the final days.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.204
The so-called "end times."

16:13.206 --> 16:15.707
He will come like a
thief in the night.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.010
No one knows the day and time.

16:20.113 --> 16:24.048
Anyone who claims to
know the day and time

16:27.220 --> 16:31.055
but in here we
have a blue print,

16:31.725 --> 16:33.191
a map,

16:33.193 --> 16:37.362
a key that could
unlock and warn us

16:37.364 --> 16:40.498
of the coming apocalypse.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.336
Sally?

16:46.740 --> 16:48.373
You're new to us here.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.111
Why don't you pick up
where Edger left off?

16:56.483 --> 16:59.417
- "And in those days
shall men seek death

16:59.419 --> 17:02.754
"and shall not find it
and shall desire to die

17:03.723 --> 17:06.190
"and death shall flee from them

17:07.227 --> 17:09.127
"and the shapes of
the locusts were like

17:09.129 --> 17:11.462
"horses prepared for battle

17:11.464 --> 17:15.099
"and on their heads crown of
gold and their faces like men.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.037
"And they had the hair
as the hair of woman

17:19.039 --> 17:21.139
"and their teeth were
the teeth of lions

17:22.442 --> 17:24.275
"and they had
breast plats of iron

17:24.277 --> 17:26.377
"and the sound of their
wings were as the sound

17:26.379 --> 17:28.813
"of chariots and horses
running to battle.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.314
(ominous music)

17:30.316 --> 17:32.283
"And they had tails
like scorpions

17:32.285 --> 17:37.121
"and they had the power to
hurt men over five months.

17:38.458 --> 17:42.660
"And the king over them was
the angel of the bottomless pit

17:42.662 --> 17:44.429
"whose name in
Hebrew tongue is...

17:46.132 --> 17:48.733
"Beezle."
(sinister music)

17:48.735 --> 17:51.135
- It's pronounced "Beelzebub."

17:59.846 --> 18:01.646
- "Beelzebub.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.447
"And in the Greek tongue
his name is Abaddon,

18:03.450 --> 18:04.348
"Lucifer."

18:05.452 --> 18:08.686
(school bell ringing)

18:12.826 --> 18:14.158
(thudding)

18:14.160 --> 18:15.259
- Hi, Sally.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.161
- Zoe.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.196
- You look great.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.597
- Oh, thanks.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.434
Is everything okay?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.837
- We wanted to welcome you back.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.107
Are you better?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.211
- What do you mean?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.879
- You know what I mean, Sally.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.781
You've been away.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.883
Everyone knows where.

18:38.885 --> 18:42.820
- I'm not sure what you're
talking about actually.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.223
- Listen,

18:45.224 --> 18:47.625
I'm trying to be sincere here,
I'm trying to be friendly.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.427
- Yeah, I'm just saying, Zoe,

18:49.429 --> 18:52.330
that everything that
everyone's saying isn't true.

18:52.332 --> 18:57.135
Okay, I wasn't in a
psych ward or rehab

18:57.137 --> 18:59.137
or juvie or whatever.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.338
It's not true.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.140
- Okay, we weren't
saying that you were.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.277
But can I ask, where were you?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.714
- I'd sort of rather
not talk about it.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.217
- Look,

19:13.219 --> 19:16.254
a couple of us are going up
to the woods after school.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.924
Me, Karen, a few others,

19:19.926 --> 19:21.225
Reed.

19:22.629 --> 19:26.898
You know, me and Reed
are kind of a thing now.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.267
- No, I didn't know that.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.936
- Well, I guess there's a lot
you don't know about Reed.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.438
- Some things a pen
pal just can't do.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.441
- Anything else, Zoe?

19:38.311 --> 19:40.178
- You and I have
a lot in common.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.382
There's no reason we
shouldn't be best friends.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.319
Just come, it'll be fun.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.658
- I don't know.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.728
I kinda of have a lot of
stuff I need to do at home.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.964
- So come after.

19:59.966 --> 20:03.768
We'll get high, we'll
tell some ghost stories,

20:03.770 --> 20:04.769
we'll get high.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.539
- You do get high, don't you?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.511
- Just think about it, okay?

20:13.513 --> 20:15.980
We'd really love
to see you there.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.949
- Yeah, I'll think about it.

20:17.951 --> 20:19.617
- Well, we'll see you later.

20:22.288 --> 20:25.423
(spooky tempo music)

20:41.407 --> 20:44.442
- The bike stopped initially
right at Martha Shaw's grave.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.511
There was a chase ending
near the north entryway

20:47.513 --> 20:52.450
where he was bludgeoned by
a blunt, circular object.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.418
Probably his own damn baseball.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.455
I want that damn
baseball, T, you hear me?

21:03.296 --> 21:06.931
And there was a single
set of bare feet

21:06.933 --> 21:08.799
that dragged the body
into the mausoleum

21:08.801 --> 21:10.368
where the body was desecrated.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.437
Fuck.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.007
- A sick individual, sir.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.410
What do you think,
like witches or?

21:20.980 --> 21:25.316
- Some kind of ritual, satanic
in nature, I don't know.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.552
Just get all that
photographed, okay?

21:28.554 --> 21:29.854
- [T] Yes, sir.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.490
(somber music)

21:48.441 --> 21:49.507
- Trickers.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.408
Our favorite.

21:51.878 --> 21:55.079
(ominous tempo music)

22:02.588 --> 22:04.322
- Want me to keep an eye on her?

22:06.359 --> 22:07.458
- Yeah.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.528
Starting to think that's
a really good idea.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.566
(ominous piano music)

22:32.085 --> 22:35.086
(swing creaking)

22:36.789 --> 22:38.756
- Why are you even
friends with her?

22:39.559 --> 22:41.392
She thinks she sees ghosts!

22:42.462 --> 22:43.427
She's crazy!

22:43.429 --> 22:44.762
- Leave her alone, Zoe.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.430
- And what're you
gonna do about it?

22:46.432 --> 22:48.466
Get your big brother
to beat me up?

22:48.468 --> 22:50.401
- I don't need my big brother.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.136
- Oh, so you want
some too, Sally?

22:53.706 --> 22:54.672
- I'm not afraid of you.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.107
- Well maybe you should be.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.441
You're freaking weird.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.012
- Oh, look, she
tripped on a ghost.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.482
- Ghost in the graveyard,
one, two, three.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.384
- Ghost in the graveyard,
can't catch me.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.721
(melancholy piano music)

23:26.005 --> 23:28.572
(eerie music)

24:06.446 --> 24:09.680
(ominous tempo music)

24:28.568 --> 24:29.800
- Nova Scotia?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.672
- [Billy] Sally, you ready?

24:34.674 --> 24:36.006
- Yeah, just one sec.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.612
- Ready? Come on.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.718
(crickets chirping)

24:52.658 --> 24:54.225
- Poor little Tommy.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.626
He was my paper boy.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.096
- I heard the police
are investigating her.

24:59.899 --> 25:00.764
- Really?

25:01.701 --> 25:02.600
Why?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.069
- Think about it.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.804
She shows up again and
this little kid is killed

25:06.806 --> 25:08.606
at Martha's fucking grave.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.075
- I didn't think of that.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.044
- Did you see her with Reed?

25:14.046 --> 25:16.180
I can't stand that bitch.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.250
- Aren't we supposed to feel
bad for her or something?

25:19.252 --> 25:22.052
- She thinks who she
is, that's for sure.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.721
- Yeah, that's what
I want to know.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.659
Who is she and what
is her fucking deal?

25:29.795 --> 25:32.763
- Think about it, she gets
back and this kid is murdered.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.599
I mean, part of him left
on the freaking grave, man.

25:35.601 --> 25:38.135
I know you guys are friends

25:38.137 --> 25:40.104
but you gotta admit this
is some pretty freaky shit.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.875
- No, no, I know Sally.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.544
At her core I know she's good.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.745
I mean, I know that.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.614
- Whatever.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.249
- No freaking way, man.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.551
- Speaking of which,

25:54.887 --> 25:57.221
thought she was coming tonight.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.622
- [Reed] Yeah, so did I.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.626
(ominous music)

26:04.063 --> 26:07.131
(somber rock music)

26:11.938 --> 26:15.639
¶ Take it back ¶

26:15.641 --> 26:19.109
¶ Take it back ¶

26:19.111 --> 26:22.580
¶ Didn't I do it ¶

26:22.582 --> 26:25.983
¶ What did you expect ¶

26:25.985 --> 26:30.588
¶ What did you expect ¶

26:30.590 --> 26:32.957
¶ 'Cause I'm gonna
answer back like that ¶

26:32.959 --> 26:34.124
- You okay?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.025
- Yeah.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.695
- You want a beer?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.901
So hanging out with
Zoe tonight, huh?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.736
Didn't she used to
make fun of you?

26:47.139 --> 26:48.572
Just saying,

26:48.573 --> 26:50.006
I don't know why you're
hanging out with these girls.

26:50.009 --> 26:53.944
- Okay, Billy, I just wanna
be apart of the group.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.780
I just want to fit
in with everybody.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.049
You know?

26:59.051 --> 27:03.821
Not trying to be this freak
who keeps seeing a dead girl.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.255
- Okay.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.358
- Gets sent away to
wanna be protected. Like.

27:08.761 --> 27:13.697
Everybody thinks I was in like
a psych ward or whatever, so.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.235
I mean, it doesn't
even matter like.

27:19.372 --> 27:22.706
We were all kids,
so, it's whatever.

27:23.809 --> 27:24.708
I just...

27:25.711 --> 27:26.944
I just wanna be normal.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.748
- But you're not.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.349
You're special.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.984
(chuckling)

27:33.986 --> 27:37.054
(faint radio music)

27:43.796 --> 27:46.964
(ominous music)

27:46.966 --> 27:48.399
- Oh my God, Billy, stop!

27:48.401 --> 27:49.099
- [Billy] Fuck!

27:49.101 --> 27:50.434
- Oh my God!

27:50.435 --> 27:51.768
Oh my God, did you not
see her standing there?

27:51.771 --> 27:52.736
- What?!

27:52.738 --> 27:53.871
No, I didn't see anything.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.406
My fucking life
flashed before my eyes.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.107
- I'm sorry, she was
standing literally

27:57.109 --> 27:59.243
in the middle of the road.
- You almost killed us!

28:00.346 --> 28:01.712
- God, okay, I'm...

28:03.683 --> 28:04.948
Sorry.

28:04.950 --> 28:05.916
- It's all right.

Anyone know who man hides his
face from in this passage?

32:46.165 --> 32:47.497
Thanks for picking me up again.

- Yeah, of course.

Do you always visit her?

- Always.

But there is something I'd
like to talk to you about.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.544

33:00.546 --> 33:02.112
- Yeah, how'd you know?

33:02.748 --> 33:04.047
- Premonition.

- Let me deal with her.

33:07.135 --> 33:09.619
I just, I think it's best if
she heard about us from me.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.288
We've hung out a
bit over the past.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.456
- Mm-hmm, yeah, okay.

33:14.026 --> 33:17.561
She hasn't always
been the nicest to me.

33:17.563 --> 33:21.431
But I do think everyone
deserves a second chance.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.499
- Even Zoe.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.734
You both deserve it.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.739
(somber music)

33:28.741 --> 33:29.639
You look...

33:30.509 --> 33:32.109
There's something different.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.045
- Like a good different?

33:35.047 --> 33:36.713
- Yeah, like a great different.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.250
- Why, thank you.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.052
I guess.
(chuckling)

33:42.054 --> 33:44.254
Is there anything else?
(giggling)

33:44.256 --> 33:45.655
- Well, yeah, I mean,

33:46.625 --> 33:48.325
you're a great friend.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.229
You're nice to everyone

33:53.132 --> 33:55.365
and I don't know how you do it.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.199
(chuckling)

33:56.201 --> 33:57.067
- What else?

33:59.038 --> 33:59.703
- Penmanship.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.439
(chuckling)

34:02.441 --> 34:03.340
- Penmanship?

34:04.276 --> 34:05.509
- Yeah.

34:05.511 --> 34:09.379
You know, all those
letters you wrote.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.082
All those promises you made.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.153
Really great penmanship.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.091
(dramatic music)

34:42.815 --> 34:44.114
- Hi.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.348
Miss Erlock.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.317
- Hey, Sally, what
brings you here?

34:47.319 --> 34:49.086
- Well, actually,

34:49.088 --> 34:51.688
my dad asked me to do a
little research for him.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.391
Like family tree stuff,

34:54.393 --> 34:57.194
war records, police records.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.564
Hopefully not a lot of those.
(chuckling)

35:00.566 --> 35:03.200
But yeah, just
marriage certificates,

35:03.202 --> 35:04.768
birth certificates.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.335
- I'm sorry, honey, but
I'm not allowed to give out

35:06.338 --> 35:08.205
that information to minors.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.273
You're gonna need your
father's permission.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.475
- Oh, really?

35:11.477 --> 35:12.676
I mean, I can call
him right now.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.444
He knows about
all this stuff so.

35:14.446 --> 35:18.115
- Well, I suppose
I can do something.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.383
You're just gonna need
to give me a few days

35:20.385 --> 35:22.219
to get everything together.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.588
- Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

35:24.590 --> 35:29.159
You have no idea how much
this means to me and my dad.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.562
Okay, great, I'll
see you in a week?

35:32.564 --> 35:33.730
- Sure, Sally.

35:33.732 --> 35:34.798
- Thank you so much.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.835
(ominous music)

35:59.224 --> 36:00.457
- Yes.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.791
It's me.

36:01.793 --> 36:02.692
Erlock.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.299
- Charlie, I'm
glad they're okay.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.936
This whole Tommy
Farkus mutilation,

36:12.938 --> 36:14.938
the ritualistic element.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.942
- She's starting
to ask questions.

36:18.944 --> 36:19.843
- I know.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.180
I think it's time to consider
all the possibilities.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.282
Even the worst.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.253
- You're right.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.459
- [Sheriff] Look,
bud, I gotta go.

36:36.461 --> 36:37.494
Thanks for the coffee.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.395
- All right.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.301
Thanks for stopping by.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.669
- Yeah.

36:45.671 --> 36:49.239
Look, I'm gonna set
a patrolman outside.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.307
- Okay.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.975
- He's one of us.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.578
If you need anything,
don't hesitate.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.947
- Great, thank you.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.553
I can always count on you.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.358
(ominous music)

37:13.298 --> 37:14.314
- Zo!

37:14.315 --> 37:15.331
- Only my friends call me Zo.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.734
What's up, Jade?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.903
- I found what you
were looking for.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.905
- Really?

37:21.906 --> 37:23.906
- Yep, I know where Sally
Sullivan was that whole time

37:23.909 --> 37:25.809
and believe me, it's good.

37:25.811 --> 37:26.710
(scoffing)

37:30.315 --> 37:31.014
- Okay.

37:43.629 --> 37:44.961
- There's something else.

37:46.031 --> 37:49.266
Sally and Reed were kind
of writing to each other

37:49.268 --> 37:50.967
while she was away.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.703
(ominous music)

38:04.016 --> 38:05.448
- You can go now, Jade.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.294
(whispering)

38:17.296 --> 38:20.764
(entry bell ringing)

38:20.766 --> 38:21.898
- Sally.

38:21.900 --> 38:22.832
- What's up, T?

38:22.834 --> 38:23.933
- Sally, you're back in town.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.402
- I am, yeah.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.804
Back in good old Mt. Mariah.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.838
Heaven on Earth.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.374
- Back a couple days
and already bored

38:31.376 --> 38:32.742
of home sweet home, huh?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.010
Sounds about right.

38:34.012 --> 38:37.547
- Well, it's called
teen angst, I guess.

38:37.549 --> 38:38.848
Sort of a right.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.083
I mean, you would know,

38:40.085 --> 38:42.052
you graduated like 15
minutes ago, right?

38:42.054 --> 38:43.386
(chuckling)

38:43.388 --> 38:44.688
- Wow.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.456
Apple doesn't fall too far
from the tree, does it?

38:46.458 --> 38:49.359
- Yeah, I think she
kinda got you there, bud.

38:49.361 --> 38:50.593
- That wouldn't be
the first time either.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.096
(chuckling)

38:53.098 --> 38:56.633
Well, I think I've
worn out my welcome.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.535
Charlie, I'll look
into that item for you.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.936
Sally, welcome back.

38:59.938 --> 39:00.737
- Thanks.

39:00.739 --> 39:01.805
- All right, thanks bud.

39:01.807 --> 39:02.706
- See you later.

39:05.077 --> 39:06.943
(entry bell ringing)

39:06.945 --> 39:09.346
So what was that all about?

39:09.348 --> 39:13.450
- Oh, I'm thinking about putting
some security in, you know,

39:13.452 --> 39:15.752
and he's got this
little side business.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.421
What're you doing?

39:18.423 --> 39:20.090
- Just dropping by.

39:20.092 --> 39:21.758
Came to say hey real quick.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.992
- [Charlie] All right.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.361
Well, make yourself cozy.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.468
- Actually, I wanted I ask you.

39:32.938 --> 39:33.803
- Yeah?

39:33.805 --> 39:35.805
- Where was I born?

39:37.142 --> 39:40.110
(somber piano music)

39:40.112 --> 39:41.978
- What makes you ask that?

39:43.582 --> 39:45.115
- Well, I always
thought I was born here

39:45.117 --> 39:47.050
in Mt. Mariah, right?

39:48.387 --> 39:49.486
- Oh.

39:49.488 --> 39:55.125
No, actually you were born
in Canada of all places.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.626
We were on vacation

39:57.729 --> 39:59.129
and you decided to
come into this world

39:59.131 --> 40:01.498
a littler earlier than expected.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.067
You're our little
Canadian goose.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.438
I thought your mother
would've told you that.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.575
- No, I don't think she did.

40:13.612 --> 40:17.013
I don't really
remember Mom, so...

40:19.451 --> 40:21.084
Do you think she's still alive?

40:22.421 --> 40:23.653
- Yeah, I know
she's still alive.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.088
I feel it in here.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.861
(entry bell ringing)

40:33.632 --> 40:37.000
- Excuse me, do you
have any rat poison?

40:38.537 --> 40:40.637
- Yeah, just this
way, follow me here.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.677
(ominous music)

40:59.925 --> 41:02.826
(ghostly whispering)

41:02.828 --> 41:03.726
Sally?

41:05.497 --> 41:07.697
- Yeah, Dad, actually
I gotta run real quick

41:07.699 --> 41:09.499
but I'll see you later.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.500
- Oh, okay.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.470
All right, I'll see
you around dinner.

41:18.743 --> 41:21.744
(foreboding music)

41:25.050 --> 41:27.183
What do we got there?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.554
That's a nice shovel,
good choice, I like that.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.056
That's a prime digger.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.962
(birds chirping)

41:40.065 --> 41:41.164
- Hi, Sally.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.066
- Hi.

41:43.869 --> 41:44.801
- Can we talk?

41:45.704 --> 41:46.669
About Martha.

41:52.878 --> 41:53.910
- Dad, I'll be back.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.889
What do you mean
you've seen her too?

42:05.891 --> 42:08.758
- Sally, everyone knows
you've seen her, don't you?

42:10.061 --> 42:12.946
- Zoe.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.832
- I mean, the difference
this time is I believe you.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.568
I've seen her too.

42:18.570 --> 42:21.638
(police radio commotion)

42:21.640 --> 42:24.007
The truth is, I've
seen her before.

42:25.577 --> 42:28.278
At first I tried to
deny her existence.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.681
I would shut my eyes
and wish her away.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.951
I was afraid they would send
me away like they did to you

42:34.953 --> 42:37.687
or I would be labeled
crazy like you were.

42:39.858 --> 42:43.560
But now something
has changed in her.

42:43.562 --> 42:46.029
She's become more menacing.

42:47.098 --> 42:49.599
She wants something
from me I think.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.734
Something from us.

42:52.837 --> 42:53.903
She said--
- Wait.

42:55.607 --> 42:57.340
She spoke to you?

42:59.110 --> 43:01.611
- [Zoe] She said,
"Beelzebub is here."

43:03.248 --> 43:04.314
- [Sally] Oh my God.

43:05.617 --> 43:08.851
I've heard that
name in my dreams.

43:08.853 --> 43:10.787
- Sally, that wasn't a dream.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.623
That's how the dead speak to us.

43:14.593 --> 43:17.260
She wants something
from me, I think.

43:17.262 --> 43:19.996
Or something from us.
(ominous music)

43:22.834 --> 43:25.768
(phone ringing)

43:27.739 --> 43:28.871
- Sheriff's office.

43:31.843 --> 43:32.809
Hey, Charlie.

43:34.746 --> 43:35.678
Oh, she does?

43:37.148 --> 43:39.048
Yeah, the black
circle's been called.

43:40.151 --> 43:41.050
Okay.

43:42.220 --> 43:43.319
Of course, Charlie.

43:46.091 --> 43:46.990
Very good.

43:48.827 --> 43:50.293
All right, goodbye.

43:54.299 --> 43:55.732
- What's up, everything okay?

43:59.638 --> 44:00.903
- I think it's time.

44:00.905 --> 44:02.672
(crickets chirping)

44:04.709 --> 44:07.010
(knocking)

44:10.181 --> 44:11.047
- [Woman] Sally?

44:11.049 --> 44:13.282
- Hi, is Zoe home?

44:13.284 --> 44:15.184
- Why not come in and we'll see?

44:15.185 --> 44:17.085
- I could just call her real
quick on my cell, it's okay.

44:17.088 --> 44:19.722
- Sally, please come in
and I'll make you some tea.

44:20.792 --> 44:21.691
- Okay.

44:23.728 --> 44:26.729
(foreboding music)

44:27.732 --> 44:29.766
- [Woman] Don't move,
I'll be right with you.

44:38.109 --> 44:40.243
Did Zoe know you were coming?

44:40.245 --> 44:41.144
- I thought so.

44:43.048 --> 44:43.946
- She did?

44:45.016 --> 44:46.215
And she didn't tell me.

44:46.985 --> 44:49.719
(ominous music)

44:55.293 --> 44:58.461
(ghostly whispering)

45:16.381 --> 45:18.948
(eerie music)

45:20.118 --> 45:22.051
What is that you're
readying, Sally Ann?

45:24.723 --> 45:26.789
You feel drawn to it, no?

45:27.492 --> 45:30.393
It calls to you, yes?

45:30.395 --> 45:31.794
- I was just looking at it.

45:32.964 --> 45:35.732
- We are so
misunderstood, Sally Ann.

45:37.469 --> 45:39.035
- Sally Ann?

45:39.037 --> 45:40.336
- Isn't that what they call you?

45:40.338 --> 45:41.270
(kettle whistling)

45:41.272 --> 45:42.905
- Are you gonna get the kettle?

45:45.810 --> 45:48.344
- You have such beautiful
hair, Sally Ann,

45:48.346 --> 45:49.479
like your mother did.

45:50.381 --> 45:51.948
May I touch it?

45:54.018 --> 45:55.218
- Mother?

45:55.220 --> 45:56.119
Sally?
(eerie music)

45:59.090 --> 46:00.473
What's going on?

46:00.474 --> 46:01.857
- We were just getting
to know one another.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.843
- [Zoe] Why?

46:03.844 --> 46:05.827
- Do not mettle with things
you don't understand.

46:08.533 --> 46:09.365
- What's going on?

46:09.367 --> 46:10.266
- You should go.

46:11.770 --> 46:13.069
- Zoe!

46:13.071 --> 46:16.072
(sinister music)
(kettle whistling)

46:18.510 --> 46:21.344
(crow squawking)

46:27.552 --> 46:29.886
(baby cooing)

46:29.888 --> 46:32.822
(Sally humming tune)

46:41.232 --> 46:44.200
(foreboding music)

47:22.373 --> 47:25.007
(horn honking)

47:33.117 --> 47:34.283
- Hey, you coming in?

47:34.285 --> 47:36.085
- [Reed] I can't, I gotta run.

47:36.087 --> 47:37.253
But come here a second.

47:37.255 --> 47:38.421
- Okay.

47:38.423 --> 47:40.890
(eerie music)

47:40.892 --> 47:42.091
Hey!

47:42.093 --> 47:43.092
Missed you.

47:49.400 --> 47:50.466
Okay.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.268
(pleasant music)

47:52.270 --> 47:53.169
- See you.

48:21.966 --> 48:24.934
(foreboding music)

48:37.448 --> 48:39.982
(creaking)

48:47.025 --> 48:50.159
(ghostly whispering)

48:52.597 --> 48:55.965
(somber piano music)

49:01.072 --> 49:01.971
- Lily?

49:12.150 --> 49:15.217
(ghostly breathing)

49:27.565 --> 49:30.299
(door creaking)

49:43.348 --> 49:46.182
(sinister music)

49:47.719 --> 49:48.617
Lily?

49:49.554 --> 49:50.453
Lily?

50:05.436 --> 50:08.004
(eerie music)

50:13.578 --> 50:15.778
Oh my God, Zoe, you
scared the shit out of me.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.446
What're you doing here?

50:18.783 --> 50:22.051
- I'm sorry, it's just
that the door was open

50:22.053 --> 50:23.753
and she was crying, so--

50:23.755 --> 50:25.488
- Did you not see
me on the street?

50:25.490 --> 50:26.722
- I didn't.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.491
What were you doing
in the street?

50:28.493 --> 50:30.659
(baby cooing)

50:30.661 --> 50:32.762
You're right, though,
I shouldn't have.

50:32.764 --> 50:34.130
- No, it's--
- Here.

50:34.132 --> 50:35.031
- It's fine.

50:36.801 --> 50:38.401
She seems to like you.

50:39.270 --> 50:41.070
- Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

50:50.415 --> 50:53.115
Martha was like the closest
thing I ever had to a sibling.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.420
Are you close?

50:57.422 --> 50:58.354
You and Billy?

51:00.091 --> 51:02.491
- Yeah, we're close.

51:04.095 --> 51:05.561
My whole family is.

51:05.563 --> 51:08.431
With everything that we've
been through, I'm sure,

51:08.433 --> 51:10.666
I wouldn't have gotten
through it all without them.

51:10.668 --> 51:11.801
- You're so lucky.

51:11.803 --> 51:16.539
Martha's family was basically
raising me until she died.

51:17.642 --> 51:21.177
My mom is, well,
she's always been

51:21.179 --> 51:22.411
a little less than ideal.

51:24.182 --> 51:25.514
I know people talk about her.

51:26.551 --> 51:27.483
Talk about us

51:29.187 --> 51:30.352
and it's mostly true.

51:32.490 --> 51:34.423
And I hate her for it.

51:36.194 --> 51:39.462
But don't think I don't
know what people are saying.

51:42.366 --> 51:44.233
- [Sally] What about your dad?

51:44.235 --> 51:45.367
- Just like your mom.

51:46.737 --> 51:47.603
Gone.

51:48.439 --> 51:51.273
(somber music)

51:53.177 --> 51:55.111
- You know, Zoe,

51:57.648 --> 51:59.548
I think that together, somehow,

52:01.219 --> 52:03.119
you and I can
really help Martha.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.257
- Thank you, Sally.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.662
- [Sally] I should probably
put this little one to bed now.

52:13.664 --> 52:14.797
- She's so perfect.

52:14.799 --> 52:15.898
- [Sally] Say goodnight, Lily.

52:15.900 --> 52:17.233
Come with me.

52:19.637 --> 52:20.202
- Goodnight, angel.

52:24.442 --> 52:27.610
(somber piano music)

52:29.914 --> 52:32.481
(baby cooing)

52:35.153 --> 52:37.386
- Okay, Lily, time for your nap.

52:39.690 --> 52:40.589
Goodnight.

52:46.697 --> 52:47.730
There we go.

52:48.533 --> 52:49.498
I love you.

53:05.883 --> 53:06.782
So.

53:07.552 --> 53:08.717
- [Zoe] So...

53:08.719 --> 53:11.453
You've been hanging
out with Reed.

53:11.455 --> 53:12.555
Have you guys done it?

53:13.658 --> 53:14.690
- Zoe, what?

53:15.826 --> 53:16.859
- Have you done it?

53:19.463 --> 53:24.533
Look, you're in on this
plan to free Martha, right?

53:25.903 --> 53:27.803
- I've actually been doing
some research of my own.

53:27.805 --> 53:29.271
Okay, remember that name

53:29.273 --> 53:30.873
I kept hearing in
my dreams a bunch?

53:30.875 --> 53:32.274
"Beelzebub."

53:32.276 --> 53:33.709
Isn't that such a creepy word?

53:33.711 --> 53:34.944
"Beelzebub?"

53:34.946 --> 53:37.346
- [Zoe] You shouldn't
say it so much.

53:37.348 --> 53:38.447
(sinister music)

53:38.449 --> 53:41.550
It gives it power.

53:41.552 --> 53:42.451
- Okay.

53:43.588 --> 53:46.956
So, this name that
shall not be said,

53:48.226 --> 53:51.427
is one of the six fallen
angels sent to Earth

53:51.429 --> 53:54.964
to disrupt His, God's, balance

53:54.966 --> 53:57.700
to turn the world
against his 11 tribes

53:58.569 --> 54:00.936
to end his earthly family.

54:04.008 --> 54:05.307
Are you okay?

54:05.309 --> 54:08.744
- That's good, Sally,
that's really good.

54:13.317 --> 54:17.486
What does Beelzebub want?

54:18.623 --> 54:22.591
What I think that it
wants is you, Sally.

54:24.028 --> 54:25.694
- Me?

54:25.696 --> 54:28.397
- I think there's something
really special about you

54:29.533 --> 54:34.036
and somehow this demon is
working its way through Martha

54:34.038 --> 54:35.304
to get to you.

54:35.306 --> 54:36.772
- Through Martha?

54:36.774 --> 54:38.374
This is like insane!

54:38.376 --> 54:40.743
I'm not special, Zoe.

54:40.745 --> 54:41.677
I'm no one.

54:43.881 --> 54:47.750
- To free a pure
spirit like Martha

54:49.053 --> 54:51.420
a pure spirit must
be sacrificed.

54:52.890 --> 54:54.390
A blood sacrifice.

54:56.360 --> 54:58.861
- A sacrifice like what?

54:58.863 --> 55:00.462
- A sinless creature.

55:01.699 --> 55:03.065
- Like a rabbit?

55:03.067 --> 55:05.768
- I don't think that'll do it.

55:05.770 --> 55:06.669
Think bigger.

55:08.539 --> 55:11.440
- A six foot tall rabbit?

55:12.510 --> 55:14.810
- What are you,
Sally-fucking-Darko?

55:14.812 --> 55:16.912
- Okay, I don't know,
what're you talking about?

55:16.914 --> 55:19.315
- Think fucking bigger.

55:19.317 --> 55:22.351
Well, if you and Reed
haven't done it yet...

55:25.089 --> 55:26.555
So you didn't fuck him.

55:27.458 --> 55:28.657
You are a virgin.

55:31.062 --> 55:34.596
- Are you saying you
want to sacrifice me?

55:35.966 --> 55:37.333
- Yeah,

55:37.335 --> 55:40.369
but not like kill
you or anything.

55:40.371 --> 55:42.104
We just need a spill,

55:43.474 --> 55:47.576
well, we need to spill your
virgin blood on her grave,

55:47.578 --> 55:49.445
say some chants

55:49.447 --> 55:53.982
and then she's free, I
think, and you will be too.

55:54.785 --> 55:56.018
It seems simple enough.

55:57.421 --> 55:59.021
- Zoe, are you...

55:59.023 --> 56:01.457
I'm sorry, are you insane?

56:01.459 --> 56:02.891
Spill my blood?

56:02.893 --> 56:03.826
- Not a lot.

56:05.096 --> 56:07.396
It's you it's after.

56:07.398 --> 56:10.366
Not me, not Martha,

56:10.368 --> 56:12.134
not Tommy Farkus.

56:12.136 --> 56:13.969
Whatever you are, it wants you.

56:13.971 --> 56:15.437
- Zoe.

56:15.439 --> 56:16.905
- You don't have to
tell me your secrets

56:16.907 --> 56:19.575
but you will help Martha!
(sinister music)

56:19.577 --> 56:22.144
(crunching)
- Ow!

56:22.146 --> 56:24.413
Ow, Zoe, you're hurting me!

56:24.415 --> 56:25.381
- Hey.
- Ow.

56:26.484 --> 56:27.449
- Sally?

56:27.451 --> 56:29.985
(ominous music)

56:40.765 --> 56:43.565
(menacing music)

56:50.975 --> 56:53.809
- I just feel the myth rumbling,

56:53.811 --> 56:57.780
like there's this
disjointed energy.

56:57.782 --> 56:59.748
- Charlie, look, I think
it's time we tell her.

57:01.185 --> 57:03.085
She needs to know, and Billy.

57:06.690 --> 57:08.957
- That's the end of
everything I know, Dale.

57:10.094 --> 57:11.727
I mean, my family...

57:12.696 --> 57:14.096
(chuckling)

57:14.098 --> 57:16.698
ends just like that?

57:16.700 --> 57:18.967
- Look, we knew
this day was coming.

57:18.969 --> 57:20.786
Okay?

57:20.787 --> 57:22.604
You've done your job, you've
done a fine job, Charlie.

57:24.208 --> 57:25.441
- She's my daughter.

57:25.443 --> 57:27.460
- I know and everybody's proud.

57:27.461 --> 57:29.478
No one could have nurtured
her better than you have.

57:31.081 --> 57:32.681
Okay?

57:32.683 --> 57:33.582
It's time.

57:34.819 --> 57:35.684
- Yeah.

57:36.821 --> 57:37.753
Thanks.

57:41.091 --> 57:42.825
(foreboding music)

57:47.565 --> 57:50.466
- And we've got another round.

57:50.468 --> 57:51.512
Cheers, man.
- Thank you.

57:51.513 --> 57:52.557
- [Bartender] Let
me know if I can get

57:52.558 --> 57:53.602
you guys anything else, yeah.

57:55.039 --> 57:57.773
(ominous music)

58:02.213 --> 58:05.180
- Dad, what is it?

58:06.484 --> 58:10.085
- There's more to Sally
than meets the eye.

58:10.087 --> 58:12.187
- Dad, what're you saying?

58:14.225 --> 58:17.960
- She's, she's, she's
not entirely your sister.

58:20.197 --> 58:21.630
- Excuse me, what?!

58:23.567 --> 58:28.203
- I've been fearing this
day for years but it's here

58:29.573 --> 58:32.608
and the time has come for me
to tell you about your family.

58:32.610 --> 58:36.111
To tell you who you
are, where you're from.

58:37.047 --> 58:40.682
Who I am, who Sally is.

58:42.286 --> 58:43.435
- Dad,

58:43.436 --> 58:44.585
you're freaking me out, okay?

58:46.624 --> 58:48.190
You're Charlie Sullivan.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.091
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

58:49.093 --> 58:50.259
- Yes.
- Yeah?

58:51.562 --> 58:53.195
You work at the hardware store.

58:53.197 --> 58:55.681
- Yeah.

58:55.682 --> 58:58.166
- What do you mean,
"who we really are?"

58:58.168 --> 58:59.735
- Since the beginning of time,

59:01.639 --> 59:04.273
there's been a battle
being waged on this earth

59:04.275 --> 59:05.707
between good and evil.

59:08.312 --> 59:11.213
Well, your family is smack
dab in the middle of it.

59:12.583 --> 59:13.582
- I don't fucking believe this.

59:14.852 --> 59:15.851
Sally?

59:15.853 --> 59:16.752
- Yeah.

59:17.721 --> 59:18.620
- And Mom?

59:20.257 --> 59:22.057
- Yes.

59:22.058 --> 59:23.858
- So you've been lying
to me this whole time.

59:23.861 --> 59:24.960
Are you even my dad?

59:24.962 --> 59:26.328
Is this even a real family?

59:26.330 --> 59:27.229
- Yes!

59:29.700 --> 59:31.233
And Sally's my daughter

59:32.603 --> 59:35.070
and the time has come for
you to help protect her.

59:37.841 --> 59:40.075
The time has come to
put on the armor, son,

59:41.111 --> 59:42.644
because we're going into battle.

59:45.149 --> 59:46.048
- Let's do it.

59:49.587 --> 59:51.153
- The shit's about
to hit the fan.

59:53.591 --> 59:54.723
I need you, son.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.060
You got me?

59:58.062 --> 59:58.994
- I got you.

1:00:00.764 --> 1:00:03.599
(dramatic music)

1:00:11.942 --> 1:00:14.776
(siren bleeping)

1:00:24.355 --> 1:00:26.388
- This is gonna be a long one.

1:00:28.892 --> 1:00:29.992
All right.

1:00:31.729 --> 1:00:33.161
What do we got here?

1:00:33.163 --> 1:00:34.296
(muffled police radio commotion)

1:00:34.298 --> 1:00:36.965
(television commotion)

1:00:41.739 --> 1:00:44.773
(crickets chirping)

1:00:48.212 --> 1:00:50.012
"Hellraiser," that's easy.

1:00:50.014 --> 1:00:50.979
Got that.

1:00:50.981 --> 1:00:52.748
(muffled police radio commotion)

1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:57.819
"Boomstick."

1:01:00.157 --> 1:01:02.891
(dramatic music)

1:01:21.745 --> 1:01:24.112
(eerie music)

1:02:00.250 --> 1:02:02.918
- Lily, you're supposed
to be sleeping.

1:02:04.822 --> 1:02:05.821
Let's go to bed, okay?

1:02:05.823 --> 1:02:06.722
Goodnight.

1:02:15.165 --> 1:02:17.966
(sinister music)

1:02:43.494 --> 1:02:44.392
Trickers?

1:02:47.531 --> 1:02:50.766
(dramatic music)

1:03:08.886 --> 1:03:11.987
(police radio buzzing)

1:03:15.359 --> 1:03:17.926
(ominous music)

1:03:18.896 --> 1:03:20.896
(wind chimes ringing)

1:03:22.199 --> 1:03:24.266
(menacing music)

1:03:30.574 --> 1:03:32.908
(groaning)

1:03:42.986 --> 1:03:46.221
(wind chimes ringing)

1:03:49.893 --> 1:03:51.059
Oh my God!

1:03:51.061 --> 1:03:52.294
Oh my God, no!

1:03:53.197 --> 1:03:54.596
T, T!

1:03:54.598 --> 1:03:56.531
Oh my God, oh my God!

1:03:56.533 --> 1:03:58.066
Oh my God!

1:03:58.068 --> 1:04:00.335
Oh no, oh my God!

1:04:03.006 --> 1:04:03.905
Martha!

1:04:06.343 --> 1:04:09.411
(suspenseful music)

1:04:18.455 --> 1:04:20.856
(whooshing)

1:04:22.025 --> 1:04:25.093
(ghostly breathing)

1:04:30.934 --> 1:04:33.635
(leaves rustling)

1:04:48.085 --> 1:04:49.885
- Look, look, slow
down, hold on.

1:04:49.887 --> 1:04:51.987
Okay, look, Onus is dead

1:04:51.989 --> 1:04:54.422
and Sally was seen fleeing
the scene into the woods.

1:04:54.424 --> 1:04:55.924
- Well did you check the house?

1:04:55.926 --> 1:04:57.058
- What about Lily?

1:04:57.060 --> 1:04:59.027
(eerie music)

1:05:04.268 --> 1:05:07.002
(door creaking)

1:05:12.576 --> 1:05:14.109
No.

1:05:14.111 --> 1:05:16.945
(sinister music)

1:05:19.383 --> 1:05:20.215
- What the fuck?

1:05:20.217 --> 1:05:21.283
Dad, help me with this!

1:05:24.021 --> 1:05:25.954
(groaning)

1:05:25.956 --> 1:05:28.290
(rattling)

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:37.198
- Oh, sweetheart.

1:05:38.435 --> 1:05:39.634
Oh, come here, sweetie.

1:05:43.941 --> 1:05:45.140
Yeah, she's okay.

1:05:45.142 --> 1:05:46.708
She's okay, she's okay.

1:05:46.710 --> 1:05:50.045
(somber music)

1:05:50.047 --> 1:05:51.279
You take her.

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:52.614
- Charlie!

1:05:52.616 --> 1:05:53.515
Charlie!

1:05:53.517 --> 1:05:54.416
Charlie!

1:05:57.054 --> 1:05:59.721
- You said it yourself,
desperate times.

1:05:59.723 --> 1:06:01.389
(gun cranking)

1:06:01.391 --> 1:06:05.527
(suspenseful music)

1:06:05.529 --> 1:06:07.429
Nobody gets my baby.

1:06:07.431 --> 1:06:08.530
(gun clicking)

1:06:08.532 --> 1:06:09.431
Let's do this.

1:06:10.367 --> 1:06:11.733
- Charlie!

1:06:11.735 --> 1:06:14.669
(ominous music)

1:06:23.447 --> 1:06:26.614
(ghostly whispering)

1:06:28.652 --> 1:06:31.219
(eerie music)

1:06:46.069 --> 1:06:47.702
- [Martha Voiceover]
She's coming for you.

1:06:49.473 --> 1:06:52.474
(thunder rumbling)

1:06:53.343 --> 1:06:56.144
(guitar picking)

1:06:57.647 --> 1:07:00.181
(knocking)

1:07:02.753 --> 1:07:04.052
- Zoe, hey.

1:07:06.223 --> 1:07:07.355
- Can I come in?

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:08.256
- Um...

1:07:11.094 --> 1:07:13.194
- [Zoe] I mean, I
got soked, so...

1:07:14.264 --> 1:07:15.230
- [Reed] Yeah.

1:07:17.367 --> 1:07:20.368
(rain trickling)

1:07:53.804 --> 1:07:55.203
You wanna get high?

1:07:57.841 --> 1:07:59.507
For old times' sake.

1:08:08.118 --> 1:08:11.086
(thunder rumbling)

1:08:15.292 --> 1:08:18.126
(rain trickling)

1:08:35.378 --> 1:08:38.580
Seems like you and
Sally have been

1:08:39.616 --> 1:08:41.282
spending a lot of time together.

1:08:46.423 --> 1:08:48.490
Looks like her and I
have a lot more in common

1:08:48.492 --> 1:08:49.591
than I even imagined.

1:08:54.531 --> 1:08:55.897
She sees ghosts.

1:09:01.471 --> 1:09:02.370
So do I.

1:09:10.814 --> 1:09:11.513
It's okay.

1:09:11.514 --> 1:09:12.213
You don't have to say anything.

1:09:21.191 --> 1:09:23.291
(exhaling)

1:09:27.230 --> 1:09:30.331
Do you know what it
means when I do that?

1:09:32.335 --> 1:09:33.868
- I think so.
(ominous music)

1:09:36.373 --> 1:09:37.272
- It means

1:09:38.708 --> 1:09:41.910
that I want you to...

1:09:53.723 --> 1:09:55.957
(sinister music)
(screaming)

1:09:55.959 --> 1:09:57.358
- [Charlie] I'm so
glad you found her.

1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:58.793
- [Man] It's no problem
at all, Charlie.

1:09:58.795 --> 1:10:00.795
- [Charlie] I can't
thank you enough.

1:10:00.797 --> 1:10:02.697
- [Officer] It's my
job, just doing my job.

1:10:03.967 --> 1:10:05.733
- [Charlie] My daughter
means everything to me.

1:10:06.736 --> 1:10:07.936
- [Officer] Okay, thanks.

1:10:07.938 --> 1:10:10.605
- So thanks for
keeping a lookout.

1:10:10.607 --> 1:10:11.839
- [Officer] I'm
gonna let you go in.

1:10:11.841 --> 1:10:13.708
- I appreciate it, yeah.

1:10:13.710 --> 1:10:14.609
All right.

1:10:24.454 --> 1:10:25.853
- Dad?

1:10:25.855 --> 1:10:26.788
- [Charlie] Hey, sweetie.

1:10:32.662 --> 1:10:34.295
- Dad, what's going on?

1:10:36.733 --> 1:10:37.632
- Sweetie.

1:10:38.468 --> 1:10:39.567
- Dad, I need to know...

1:10:42.472 --> 1:10:44.405
There's something that
you need to tell me.

1:10:47.711 --> 1:10:50.345
Something else that you've
been keeping from me.

1:10:54.384 --> 1:10:56.951
- Oh God, this is
harder than I expected.

1:10:58.822 --> 1:11:00.622
- Dad, I found my
birth certificate.

1:11:03.793 --> 1:11:04.692
- [Charlie] Oh, sweetie.

1:11:09.399 --> 1:11:11.549
- Am I adopted?

1:11:11.550 --> 1:11:13.700
Why do I not have a last
name on my birth certificate?

1:11:14.504 --> 1:11:15.570
- It's complicated.

1:11:18.942 --> 1:11:21.442
- What happened to Mom?

1:11:26.549 --> 1:11:28.349
- They got her.

1:11:28.351 --> 1:11:29.450
- [Sally] Who?

1:11:32.922 --> 1:11:33.821
- Sally,

1:11:33.823 --> 1:11:40.028
you know that I love you more
than anything in the world.

1:11:41.598 --> 1:11:43.731
I held you the day
that you were born

1:11:43.733 --> 1:11:47.035
and I have loved you ever since

1:11:47.037 --> 1:11:49.037
more than any father could.

1:11:52.709 --> 1:11:53.574
But yeah,

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:57.545
yeah,

1:11:58.381 --> 1:11:59.447
you're right.

1:12:02.485 --> 1:12:03.985
You were given to us,

1:12:05.055 --> 1:12:07.722
to raise and to protect

1:12:07.724 --> 1:12:09.357
and to love.

1:12:09.359 --> 1:12:10.425
- Who am I, Dad?

1:12:13.430 --> 1:12:14.729
- You're Sally Sullivan,

1:12:16.533 --> 1:12:18.399
the daughter of Charlie Sullivan

1:12:21.905 --> 1:12:24.906
but you were born for
something much bigger.

1:12:27.377 --> 1:12:28.076
Sweetie,

1:12:30.513 --> 1:12:34.816
you come from a long,
long sacred bloodline.

1:12:36.986 --> 1:12:39.087
You're one the
descendants of Mary.

1:12:42.492 --> 1:12:44.492
Yeah, that Mary.

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:50.865
Sweetie,

1:12:50.866 --> 1:12:51.698
that's why we've had to hide you

1:12:52.902 --> 1:12:57.071
and that's why
they're after you.

1:12:57.073 --> 1:12:57.939
- Who is?

1:12:59.476 --> 1:13:00.675
- The bad guys.

1:13:04.914 --> 1:13:07.715
But all of them have
one thing in common,

1:13:07.717 --> 1:13:10.785
and that is they have the hand
of Satan on their shoulder

1:13:11.855 --> 1:13:14.021
and his words turn
in their ears.

1:13:17.594 --> 1:13:19.761
(eerie music)

1:13:19.763 --> 1:13:21.696
- Does Billy know about this?

1:13:21.698 --> 1:13:22.830
- Only just now.

1:13:27.036 --> 1:13:28.169
You have to know...

1:13:31.608 --> 1:13:36.010
That all the good that has
ever been done on this earth

1:13:38.415 --> 1:13:42.116
rests upon the
safety of your family

1:13:43.953 --> 1:13:45.453
and they're after us.

1:13:46.756 --> 1:13:48.156
And the closer they get to us,

1:13:48.158 --> 1:13:50.458
the closer we get
to the end of days.

1:13:51.528 --> 1:13:52.794
- Like in Revelations?

1:13:54.431 --> 1:13:55.530
- Yeah.

1:13:57.167 --> 1:14:02.570
- "And in those days shall
men seek death and not find it

1:14:03.873 --> 1:14:05.606
"and desire to die."

1:14:07.177 --> 1:14:11.612
- [Both] "And death
will flee from them."

1:14:14.717 --> 1:14:17.685
- The night that Martha died,
that was supposed to be you

1:14:21.558 --> 1:14:23.591
but they didn't
wanna just kill you,

1:14:24.828 --> 1:14:26.894
they wanted to sacrifice you.

1:14:28.531 --> 1:14:31.032
And baby, if that had happened,
I don't know what I'd do.

1:14:32.569 --> 1:14:34.035
It'd be the end of the world.

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:37.905
Sweetie,

1:14:38.808 --> 1:14:39.774
you're my daughter

1:14:41.544 --> 1:14:43.511
and you will always
be my little girl.

1:14:44.581 --> 1:14:47.215
(dramatic music)

1:14:48.718 --> 1:14:50.485
Now I have something for you.

1:14:52.555 --> 1:14:55.790
This actually came with you.

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:58.259
This is yours.

1:15:00.497 --> 1:15:05.233
This was blessed by Mary in
France after she fled Jerusalem

1:15:05.235 --> 1:15:08.069
from the very hands that
are chasing after you.

1:15:09.572 --> 1:15:11.506
This is your family heritage.

1:15:12.909 --> 1:15:14.609
- What're you gonna do?

1:15:15.278 --> 1:15:16.944
- I'm gonna go
kill some witches.

1:15:19.782 --> 1:15:20.681
Sweetheart,

1:15:22.886 --> 1:15:23.951
whatever you do,

1:15:24.954 --> 1:15:27.755
do not leave this hospital.

1:15:28.558 --> 1:15:29.590
You understand that?

1:15:29.592 --> 1:15:31.592
- I do, yeah.

1:15:31.594 --> 1:15:33.561
- You promise?
- I promise.

1:15:33.563 --> 1:15:34.262
- Okay.

1:15:35.598 --> 1:15:36.764
Okay, I love you.

1:15:37.901 --> 1:15:39.000
- [Sally] I love you.

1:15:44.841 --> 1:15:47.842
(foreboding music)

1:15:50.547 --> 1:15:53.748
(coyote howling)

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:56.817
(crickets chirping)

1:16:11.901 --> 1:16:15.703
(distant train horn blowing)

1:16:18.942 --> 1:16:22.176
(ominous piano music)

1:16:33.823 --> 1:16:36.891
(music box chiming)

1:16:45.735 --> 1:16:49.670
(ghostly children laughing)

1:16:51.608 --> 1:16:53.975
(eerie music)

1:16:56.879 --> 1:16:59.947
(suspenseful music)

1:17:12.128 --> 1:17:13.060
- [Woman] Are you okay?

1:17:13.062 --> 1:17:14.178
Sally!
- No!

1:17:14.179 --> 1:17:15.295
- Sally, you need
to come with me!

1:17:15.298 --> 1:17:16.230
- No!

1:17:16.232 --> 1:17:17.131
No!

1:17:22.772 --> 1:17:24.271
- Sally!

1:17:24.273 --> 1:17:27.274
(foreboding music)

1:17:33.149 --> 1:17:34.949
- You're not gonna believe this.

1:17:34.951 --> 1:17:36.417
- Now what?

1:17:36.419 --> 1:17:39.120
- Sally Sullivan just escaped
from the emergency center.

1:17:39.122 --> 1:17:41.155
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

1:17:41.157 --> 1:17:43.290
Plan on doing some work today?

1:17:43.292 --> 1:17:45.726
Shit's about to go down
and I think I know where.

1:17:45.728 --> 1:17:46.394
Get your weapon.

1:17:48.398 --> 1:17:51.666
(suspenseful music)

1:18:01.444 --> 1:18:04.845
(police siren alarming)

1:18:11.054 --> 1:18:12.386
(unsettling music)

1:18:12.388 --> 1:18:13.320
- Reed!

1:18:13.322 --> 1:18:14.321
Reed!

1:18:14.323 --> 1:18:15.723
Reed, oh God.

1:18:15.725 --> 1:18:18.125
Oh God, help us.

1:18:18.127 --> 1:18:19.994
Reed, Reed.

1:18:19.996 --> 1:18:21.062
Reed, buddy.

1:18:22.231 --> 1:18:24.732
Dear God, no, no.

1:18:24.734 --> 1:18:25.700
Reed, Reed.

1:18:26.736 --> 1:18:27.902
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:18:29.305 --> 1:18:30.171
Come on.

1:18:30.173 --> 1:18:32.406
(growling)

1:18:32.408 --> 1:18:34.442
(yelling)

1:18:34.444 --> 1:18:35.810
(whooshing)

1:18:36.446 --> 1:18:39.714
(suspenseful music)

1:19:01.771 --> 1:19:02.803
(door thudding)

1:19:04.741 --> 1:19:06.941
¶ One o'clock the
ghost isn't here ¶

1:19:06.943 --> 1:19:09.777
¶ Two o'clock the
ghost isn't here ¶

1:19:09.779 --> 1:19:11.812
(eerie music)

1:19:18.821 --> 1:19:21.856
(muffled police radio commotion)

1:19:21.858 --> 1:19:22.790
- What is that?

1:19:31.534 --> 1:19:32.767
What is this?

1:19:35.404 --> 1:19:36.537
- You believe in the devil?

1:19:37.807 --> 1:19:38.506
- What?

1:19:38.508 --> 1:19:41.509
- Look, I don't know if
you're a religious man or not

1:19:41.511 --> 1:19:43.110
but if I were you,

1:19:43.112 --> 1:19:44.378
I'd let the good
sister, here, bless you

1:19:44.380 --> 1:19:45.813
before you go in there.

1:19:47.350 --> 1:19:50.818
(seatbelt alarm dinging)

1:19:56.926 --> 1:19:59.860
- In the name of the
Father and the Son

1:19:59.862 --> 1:20:02.196
and the Holy Ghost, Amen.

1:20:03.833 --> 1:20:06.367
(footsteps thumping)

1:20:06.369 --> 1:20:09.036
(wind howling)

1:20:10.940 --> 1:20:12.873
Bless you, my son.

1:20:12.875 --> 1:20:15.910
In the name of the
Father and the Son

1:20:15.912 --> 1:20:17.878
and the Holy Ghost,

1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:18.979
Amen.

1:20:19.549 --> 1:20:20.848
- Joe,

1:20:21.551 --> 1:20:23.851
you head for the mausoleum,

1:20:23.853 --> 1:20:25.853
I'm gonna head down
for the crosses.

1:20:25.855 --> 1:20:27.588
And radio me if you need help.

1:20:27.590 --> 1:20:28.455
You got it?

1:20:28.457 --> 1:20:29.356
- All right.

1:20:30.827 --> 1:20:31.926
- God is with you.

1:20:33.229 --> 1:20:34.562
God is with you both.

1:20:35.464 --> 1:20:38.199
(ominous music)

1:20:39.035 --> 1:20:40.134
- Is anybody there?!

1:20:42.505 --> 1:20:45.472
(distant growling)

1:20:56.586 --> 1:20:59.553
(menacing music)

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:07.428
(eerie piano music)

1:21:10.633 --> 1:21:11.498
- Hello?

1:21:19.275 --> 1:21:22.543
Hello, is anybody in there?

1:21:26.515 --> 1:21:29.483
(unsettling music)

1:21:32.121 --> 1:21:34.922
(growling)
(screaming)

1:21:36.459 --> 1:21:39.426
(foreboding music)

1:21:41.631 --> 1:21:45.366
(speaking foreign language)

1:21:46.669 --> 1:21:47.935
- Kill her.

1:21:47.937 --> 1:21:50.905
(sinister music)

1:22:15.598 --> 1:22:19.033
(ominous tempo music)

1:22:47.630 --> 1:22:50.364
(Sally huffing)

1:22:55.304 --> 1:22:58.272
(foreboding music)

1:23:01.577 --> 1:23:02.409
(thudding)

1:23:02.411 --> 1:23:03.310
- Game's over, bitch!

1:23:04.347 --> 1:23:05.612
Oh my God, Zoe?!

1:23:07.516 --> 1:23:08.615
Shit.

1:23:08.617 --> 1:23:11.585
Oh no, oh my God, I killed her.

1:23:11.587 --> 1:23:12.720
Oh my God.

1:23:16.325 --> 1:23:19.126
(sinister music)

1:23:20.997 --> 1:23:23.197
(squelching)
(Sally yelping)

1:23:23.199 --> 1:23:26.133
(laughing)

1:23:26.135 --> 1:23:28.635
(whimpering)

1:23:34.243 --> 1:23:35.142
Dad, no!

1:23:37.046 --> 1:23:39.346
- Sally.

1:23:39.348 --> 1:23:41.081
- Oh my God!

1:23:41.083 --> 1:23:44.084
(menacing music)

1:23:45.287 --> 1:23:48.389
(Sally screaming)

1:23:48.391 --> 1:23:49.656
- And you shall know me,

1:23:50.793 --> 1:23:54.061
for I shall cast out
demons in His name.

1:23:54.063 --> 1:23:57.031
(gunshot booming)
(dramatic music)

1:23:57.033 --> 1:24:00.134
And I shall speak in
tongues of angels.

1:24:01.070 --> 1:24:04.104
- Sally!
(gunshot booming)

1:24:04.106 --> 1:24:07.041
- I rebuke and bind thee, Satan.

1:24:07.643 --> 1:24:09.810
(booming)

1:24:09.812 --> 1:24:12.112
(gagging)

1:24:12.114 --> 1:24:13.147
(gunshot booming)

1:24:13.149 --> 1:24:15.149
- Just die, Sally.

1:24:15.151 --> 1:24:17.317
(sinister music)
(gagging)

1:24:19.822 --> 1:24:21.121
- Zoe!

1:24:21.123 --> 1:24:23.824
(gunshot booming)

1:24:28.798 --> 1:24:31.832
(dramatic music)

1:24:40.142 --> 1:24:41.775
- Sally, get away,
that's not Zoe.

1:24:45.314 --> 1:24:48.248
(ominous music)

1:24:54.857 --> 1:24:57.658
(gasping)

1:24:57.660 --> 1:24:59.393
And you shall know me, Satan,

1:25:00.496 --> 1:25:02.196
the Lord, thy God,

1:25:03.732 --> 1:25:07.267
and you shall reside at
the foot of the cross

1:25:08.838 --> 1:25:13.240
for all days until
you are summoned

1:25:14.844 --> 1:25:18.145
and you shall be cast
into the bottomless pit.

1:25:19.715 --> 1:25:20.614
Amen.

1:25:24.487 --> 1:25:25.786
(knife slicing)

1:25:28.424 --> 1:25:31.258
(dramatic music)

1:25:40.569 --> 1:25:42.269
(faint breathing)

1:26:02.458 --> 1:26:04.224
This belongs to you now, Sally.

1:26:05.928 --> 1:26:07.294
All right, take it.

1:26:09.832 --> 1:26:11.532
Everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

1:26:12.668 --> 1:26:14.268
I promise.

1:26:14.270 --> 1:26:15.602
Everything's gonna be all right.

1:26:31.253 --> 1:26:34.421
(somber piano music)

1:26:43.966 --> 1:26:45.699
- You did good, kiddo.

1:26:45.701 --> 1:26:46.633
- Thank you, Dad.

1:26:46.635 --> 1:26:47.768
- [Charlie] You did so good.

1:26:47.770 --> 1:26:49.670
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1:26:49.672 --> 1:26:50.938
- I love you.

1:26:50.940 --> 1:26:52.372
- I love you.

1:26:52.374 --> 1:26:56.210
Keep this always.

1:26:56.212 --> 1:26:57.344
This is yours now.

1:27:02.952 --> 1:27:04.651
- I'll be right back.
- I'll see you later.

1:27:04.653 --> 1:27:05.552
- Reed.

1:27:08.224 --> 1:27:08.922
Wait!

1:27:11.327 --> 1:27:12.226
Reed.

1:27:16.332 --> 1:27:19.499
Thank you for always
believing in me.

1:27:24.573 --> 1:27:27.741
(somber piano music)

1:27:50.666 --> 1:27:52.866
(engine rumbling)

1:27:52.868 --> 1:27:56.403
(dramatic piano music)

1:28:03.512 --> 1:28:04.411
- Hey.

1:28:06.015 --> 1:28:06.913
You okay?

1:28:07.850 --> 1:28:09.549
You wanna go home?

1:28:09.551 --> 1:28:11.351
Told ya you were special.

1:28:12.521 --> 1:28:15.322
(dramatic music)

1:28:18.327 --> 1:28:19.426
Take us home.

1:28:22.798 --> 1:28:24.031
- [Sally Voiceover]
Zoe liked to say

1:28:24.033 --> 1:28:26.066
the dead talked to
us in our sleep.

1:28:27.770 --> 1:28:28.869
I hope she was right

1:28:30.072 --> 1:28:32.039
because Martha often came to me,

1:28:33.042 --> 1:28:34.441
talked with me,

1:28:34.443 --> 1:28:38.312
but from then on, only in the
night when I was dreaming.

1:28:40.082 --> 1:28:42.783
Never would I see her face again

1:28:42.785 --> 1:28:46.453
running amongst the heather and
vine of Mt. Mariah Cemetery.

1:28:48.524 --> 1:28:50.691
Others claim to see her

1:28:52.027 --> 1:28:54.461
and the truth and the
fiction of what began here

1:28:54.463 --> 1:28:57.397
in our little town became
blurred with the passing years.

1:28:59.435 --> 1:29:02.502
Most made her out as some demon.

1:29:03.839 --> 1:29:05.072
And that was sad.

1:29:07.109 --> 1:29:11.411
But I knew she was an angel
sent by God to protect me.

1:29:13.982 --> 1:29:14.915
At the time,

1:29:16.085 --> 1:29:19.086
I thought this was an end for me

1:29:19.088 --> 1:29:21.655
and the events
surrounding her death.

1:29:23.892 --> 1:29:25.425
But the reality was

1:29:26.128 --> 1:29:28.528
this was just my initiation

1:29:29.398 --> 1:29:32.999
into a lifetime battle
the forces of evil

1:29:33.001 --> 1:29:35.669
as I sought to discover
God's plan for me

1:29:36.739 --> 1:29:40.107
and my place in His kingdom.

1:29:45.814 --> 1:29:46.680
The reality was...

1:29:46.681 --> 1:29:47.547
it was just the beginning.
(ominous music)

1:29:51.453 --> 1:29:54.821
(suspenseful tempo music)

1:30:50.579 --> 1:30:54.114
(suspenseful tempo music)

1:31:47.202 --> 1:31:50.737
(suspenseful tempo music)
