I do not look like that.
‐And that's you. And that's you.

Yeah, you're right.
You're way cuter.

Do you see the cupcaking
going on on my couch?

00:40.620 --> 00:43.330
Yes. I see it.

But it's a lot more fun
watching you see it.

look great enough to feel great.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.270
So here's my proposal.

20:35.270 --> 20:39.020
Both your businesses
are about inspiring people
to be their best.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.900
So why not combine them,

20:40.900 --> 20:42.570
so that people can live
their best life?

20:44.030 --> 20:45.200
Well.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.450
Gosh.
If I'm doing my math right,

20:48.450 --> 20:51.950
one plus one equals one.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.500
Life coaching and styling.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.250
‐(gasps)
‐Both: Life styling!

20:59.250 --> 21:01.880
Chels, Chels.
Listen, a complete makeover

21:01.880 --> 21:03.590
‐inside and out. You know?
‐Yeah.

21:03.590 --> 21:06.930
Combining our companies
makes sense in every way!

21:06.930 --> 21:10.140
A ha ha ha! Yes!

21:10.140 --> 21:13.180
My job is done here.
I quit.

21:14.730 --> 21:17.810
I expect prompt payment
for one stop‐motion camera.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.230
Thank you.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.740
(knocking)

21:29.070 --> 21:31.080
So, um...

21:31.080 --> 21:33.540
‐I guess the girls told you
about what happened with Danni?
‐No.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.710
No. No, no.

21:35.710 --> 21:37.500
Yes. Yeah.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.250
So, um, I guess you're
pretty happy right now.

21:41.250 --> 21:44.090
No. No, I am not happy
that you're sad.

21:44.090 --> 21:47.260
But I have to admit,
I was a little worried.

21:47.260 --> 21:50.100
You guys were spending
too much time together.
It was too much, too soon.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.180
I guess I'm still trying
to figure out the whole
boyfriend‐girlfriend thing.

21:53.930 --> 21:56.190
And you have a lot
of time for that.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.190
You don't have to rush it.
You're only 13.

21:58.190 --> 22:00.230
And on the bright side,

22:00.230 --> 22:02.110
you know, you guys can
hang out as friends.

22:03.110 --> 22:04.440
You're right.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.280
And I guess that frees me up

22:06.280 --> 22:07.660
to spend some time
with my number one girl.

22:08.570 --> 22:09.910
What are you doing
this weekend, Momma?

22:09.910 --> 22:13.790
(happy squealing)

22:13.790 --> 22:17.580
Oh, I love you!
Well, I'm free.
But you grounded.

22:17.580 --> 22:20.750
Woo! Wow.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.470
Look! It's the arch‐villain
Anchovious.

22:28.470 --> 22:31.260
‐(growling)
‐I bet he wants to
cover us in pizza sauce.

22:31.260 --> 22:33.390
And steal our candy.

22:34.430 --> 22:37.310
If only we could get a hold
of our little brother.

22:37.310 --> 22:39.600
Who is stronger,
and wiser, and‐‐

22:39.600 --> 22:42.190
Oh, come on, Levi.
Give me a break.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.650
Levi:
<i>Just read</i>
<i>what's on the page.</i>

22:44.650 --> 22:47.320
Fine. If only
we could get a hold
of our little brother

22:47.320 --> 22:50.820
who is stronger and wiser
and could easily save
those weaker than himself.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.120
Levi‐osaurus has
his hands full.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.700
But have no fear.

22:54.700 --> 22:58.710
His sidekick,
insert‐cool‐name‐here,
is here!

22:58.710 --> 23:00.330
Really, Levi?

23:00.330 --> 23:02.920
Levi: <i>What?</i>
<i>I'm up for suggestions</i>
<i>on a cool name.</i>

23:02.920 --> 23:05.250
How about...
hi‐ya!
