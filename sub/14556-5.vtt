00:04.472 --> 00:15.183
( music playing )

00:44.345 --> 00:47.315
( children laughing
and cheering )

00:48.240 --> 00:50.250
What's wrong?

00:50.280 --> 00:51.410
I really should get
back to work.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.920
It's her sixth birthday party.
Please, it's important.

00:54.950 --> 00:57.120
Emily's having a great time.
She won't even know I'm gone.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.190
( kids cheering )

01:02.990 --> 01:04.630
( kids cheering )

01:04.660 --> 01:07.400
CLOWN: What's your
favorite color?

01:07.430 --> 01:08.430
- Green!
- Blue!

01:08.460 --> 01:10.530
Okay, what color
is this?

01:10.570 --> 01:13.000
( classical music playing )

01:13.040 --> 01:14.200
( sighs )

01:26.980 --> 01:29.090
Bye-bye.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.960
Check or credit card'll
be fine, Mrs. Burdick.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.260
Oh, right, let me get my
checkbook. Hold on.

01:33.290 --> 01:35.090
Bye.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.070
Hey, where you going?

01:48.400 --> 01:49.370
EMILY:
Mommy!

01:49.410 --> 01:51.110
No, no, no!
No, no! No!

01:51.140 --> 01:52.480
( screams ):
Mommy!

01:52.510 --> 01:55.280
Emily! Emily! Please!

01:55.310 --> 01:57.480
Help me, Mommy!

01:57.510 --> 02:00.220
Emily!

02:00.250 --> 02:04.120
( whimpers )

02:04.150 --> 02:05.620
Ethan!

02:08.720 --> 02:11.260
( siren wailing )

02:17.700 --> 02:20.000
( indistinct voices )

02:24.240 --> 02:26.040
We've got Amber alerts
up on freeway signs.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.580
We've already received
over 300 tips.

02:27.610 --> 02:30.380
I promise you we'll run down
every one of 'em.

02:30.410 --> 02:31.180
What is this about?

02:31.210 --> 02:32.750
Do you think
they want money from us?

02:32.780 --> 02:34.320
We're prepared

02:34.350 --> 02:37.490
for the possibility
of a ransom demand.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.320
We have maybe $3,000
in savings.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.520
Our house is
second-mortgaged.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.530
At this point, we don't have
enough information for a motive.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.690
This form here--

02:45.730 --> 02:47.460
it'll help you remember
everyone who's been

02:47.500 --> 02:48.130
to your house

02:48.160 --> 02:49.630
within the last
few months--

02:49.670 --> 02:51.370
baby-sitters, gardeners...

02:51.400 --> 02:53.240
You have a worksheet for this?

02:54.370 --> 02:58.040
( gasps )

02:58.070 --> 02:59.310
David...

03:04.280 --> 03:06.020
We've got 36
registered sex offenders

03:06.050 --> 03:07.320
just within three
square miles.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.150
We'll need to look
at all of them.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.490
Hey.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.020
You guys got anything
on the clowns?

03:12.060 --> 03:13.490
We're collecting photographs
and video taken

03:13.520 --> 03:14.490
at the party
for a possible I.D.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.490
Okay, the mother got 'em
through the same company

03:16.530 --> 03:18.030
that supplied the
party rentals.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.160
About two days
before the party,

03:19.200 --> 03:21.330
someone calls the company,
says they're Ethan Burdick

03:21.360 --> 03:23.030
and cancels the clowns,

03:23.070 --> 03:24.500
although Ethan says
it wasn't him.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.170
So whoever planned this
knew about the party,

03:26.200 --> 03:27.340
knew which
rental company.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.210
The mom, dad, both...

03:29.240 --> 03:30.570
I watched them
during the interview.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.310
Neither one of them
looked to the other

03:32.340 --> 03:33.510
for visual or verbal cues.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.340
No indication
of a rehearsed story.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.210
If one of them's involved, the
other one doesn't know about it.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.050
I want to check out
the dad's office.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.350
- Where's that?
DAVID: That way.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.150
All right.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.550
What this is
is abstract number theory,

04:10.580 --> 04:12.220
most of it dealing
with prime numbers,

04:12.250 --> 04:13.380
which are numbers
that can't...

04:13.420 --> 04:15.080
I know what prime
numbers are, Charlie.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.190
You can't divide 'em
into smaller ones.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.390
Don, this is deep stuff.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.960
This is very advanced work.

04:20.990 --> 04:21.960
His name's Ethan Burdick.

04:21.990 --> 04:22.890
You know him?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.490
No, I've never heard of him,
although...

04:24.530 --> 04:26.600
you know, just a preliminary
look at his work...

04:27.960 --> 04:29.130
These ideas

04:29.170 --> 04:32.340
on the Critical Strip are...

04:32.370 --> 04:34.400
are elegant.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.270
He's got an approach here
I've actually never seen before.

04:38.310 --> 04:40.240
Wait a minute. All this from a
preliminary look at his work?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.650
I'd say Ethan Burdick
is seriously brilliant.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.110
So brilliant he
didn't notice

04:45.150 --> 04:47.350
his only kid being snatched
right outside his window.

04:47.380 --> 04:48.250
ETHAN:
Yes, I will.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.020
Who is he
talking to?

04:50.050 --> 04:51.520
Officer, take your guys
in the backyard, on the side,

04:51.550 --> 04:53.160
and take them
out of my house.

04:53.190 --> 04:54.320
If I ask you to leave, you
leave.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.520
Mr. Burdick...

04:55.560 --> 04:56.660
That's it. End of argument.
There's no discussion here.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.530
I don't need your cooperation
in this investigation.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.100
Whoa, sir, sir, just talk to me.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.260
I don't need the police,
I don't need the FBI

05:01.300 --> 05:02.570
to find my daughter anymore.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.070
Tell me who called you?

05:04.100 --> 05:05.030
I need you to leave.
Everyone, out of the house, now.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.400
Sir, who called you?

05:10.510 --> 05:12.240
CHARLIE:
We all use math every day...

05:12.280 --> 05:16.410
every day...
to predict weather...

05:16.450 --> 05:17.650
to tell time...

05:17.680 --> 05:20.380
to handle money...

05:20.420 --> 05:25.290
Math is more than
formulas and equations.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.460
It's logic.

05:27.490 --> 05:29.430
Math is more than
formulas and equations.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.860
It's rationality.

05:30.890 --> 05:35.970
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

05:45.140 --> 05:47.640
I told you people to leave.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.510
Do you even have any idea
what you're looking at?

05:50.550 --> 05:52.580
Yes. You're making
significant progress

05:52.620 --> 05:54.420
toward proving
Riemann's Hypothesis.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.250
Yeah. Very good.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.290
You know something
about advanced number theory.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.120
Sorry. I should've
introduced myself.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.760
My name is Charlie Eppes.

06:03.790 --> 06:05.030
I'm a professor at CalSci.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.460
I should've
recognized you.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.630
I attended your
lecture series

06:08.660 --> 06:10.430
on P vs. NP a
couple years ago.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.100
Your work showed

06:12.140 --> 06:14.100
a certain... insight.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.540
Where'd you get your degree?

06:17.570 --> 06:19.310
I studied at Cornell,

06:19.340 --> 06:22.450
but I never finished
my doctoral thesis.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.410
You've obviously done
amazing work here.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.450
You should,
uh, have it published,

06:26.480 --> 06:28.250
get it out
into the math community.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.650
Yeah.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.290
I actually, uh,
have the solution.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.390
You can prove
Riemann's Hypothesis?

06:34.420 --> 06:37.230
After 15 years,
I should hope so.

06:39.830 --> 06:43.230
So... Agent Eppes is...?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.100
My brother Don.

06:45.130 --> 06:47.070
In that case, I'm going to
have to ask you to leave, too.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.210
- I'm sorry, I...
- Now.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.380
What happened?

06:55.410 --> 06:57.180
We were almost
through the worksheet,

06:57.210 --> 06:58.810
uh, when he got the call
on his cell phone.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.180
David...

07:00.220 --> 07:01.380
I screwed up.

07:02.450 --> 07:03.650
Mr. Burdick, who
contacted you?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.350
We don't have
to cooperate

07:05.390 --> 07:06.660
with this investigation.

07:06.690 --> 07:08.290
If I ask you to leave,
you're required to leave.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.660
Sir, just please
calm down.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.260
Now, I got to tell
you, taking advice

07:11.290 --> 07:12.760
from the people that
kidnapped your daughter

07:12.800 --> 07:14.130
- is not a good idea.
- Ethan, what's...?

07:14.160 --> 07:15.260
Becky, I'm in control
of the situation.

07:15.300 --> 07:15.930
I know what's going on.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.470
Sir, you're
wrong twice now.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.830
That's what these
people are counting on.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.340
Now, I've been through
this many times before.

07:21.370 --> 07:22.540
We can greatly increase
the chances

07:22.570 --> 07:25.410
of getting your daughter back,
but you've just got to try

07:25.440 --> 07:26.710
and cooperate
with us.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.680
BECKY:
Emily!

07:29.710 --> 07:30.850
EMILY:
Mommy!

07:30.880 --> 07:32.220
We need to keep working
the case.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.280
Our job is to find
the girl

07:33.320 --> 07:34.850
with or without the family's
cooperation, right?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.350
Yeah. I think that
the kidnapping was

07:36.390 --> 07:38.520
way too much effort
for a $3,000 payday.

07:38.550 --> 07:40.360
Yeah. Hey, Charlie,
let me ask you something.

07:40.390 --> 07:42.390
The math thing
that the father was working on--

07:42.430 --> 07:44.360
is there any way
that could be worth money?

07:44.390 --> 07:46.360
Well, it is one
of the Millennium Problems.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.700
What's a Millennium
Problem?

07:47.730 --> 07:49.870
Seven, like, classic,
difficult math problems.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.530
The Clay Institute
of Mathematics offers

07:51.570 --> 07:53.870
one million dollars for
the solutions to each of them.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.400
All right, well,
that's motive.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.240
So, how would
he collect the award?

07:57.270 --> 07:58.710
Well, first, the solution has
to be published

07:58.740 --> 07:59.640
in a refereed journal.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.540
Then it has to achieve
general acceptance

08:01.580 --> 08:03.550
in the math community over
the course of two years.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.450
And then an advisory
committee is convened...

08:05.480 --> 08:07.250
It's possible somebody knows
he's working on it

08:07.280 --> 08:08.720
but doesn't know how far off
the award is.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.550
Right, well, who else would know
he was working on it?

08:10.590 --> 08:12.420
I would check
with the math journals,

08:12.460 --> 08:14.590
you know, because maybe he
contacted some of them.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.390
All right, why don't you
give me some of those names?

08:16.430 --> 08:18.130
Here, actually, you write it...

08:18.160 --> 08:19.730
DAVID: The American Journal of
Number Theory

08:19.760 --> 08:21.360
says you're
the point man on papers

08:21.400 --> 08:22.900
for Riemann Hypothesis.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.900
I've worked on it
for two decades.

08:24.930 --> 08:27.400
Occupational hazard in math--
getting known as the guy

08:27.440 --> 08:29.740
who can't stop trying
to prove Riemann's--

08:29.770 --> 08:31.740
but, uh, I'm
not the first.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.410
So, you referee the papers
on the Riemann

08:33.440 --> 08:34.740
submitted to the journal,
correct?

08:34.780 --> 08:36.510
Yeah.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.280
That's how I first met
Ethan Burdick.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.280
Now, two years ago,
he wrote a letter

08:40.320 --> 08:42.290
announcing that he was
getting close to a solution

08:42.320 --> 08:43.790
to the problem
and that he was going

08:43.820 --> 08:46.620
to publish his findings
once his work was complete.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.930
Now, when he didn't, uh,
follow up for several months,

08:49.960 --> 08:51.460
I went to see him.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.460
I went back several times.
Please.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.760
What did you think, um,
of his work?

08:55.800 --> 08:57.570
Oh, it was brilliant,
and he made

08:57.600 --> 09:00.470
significant breakthroughs,
but it was never quite ready.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.940
Now, a month ago, he wrote,

09:01.970 --> 09:05.470
saying that he was ready
to announce a solution,

09:05.510 --> 09:07.180
and this time, he was sure.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.580
( sighs )

09:13.650 --> 09:15.120
You think Atwood knew
something?

09:15.150 --> 09:16.120
He was scared
of something.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.120
Look at this.

09:17.150 --> 09:18.420
The list the
Burdicks gave us?

09:18.450 --> 09:20.420
The mother says a
cable guy came by

09:20.460 --> 09:22.130
six weeks ago
to upgrade the wiring.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.060
Cable company has no record.

09:24.090 --> 09:26.160
Well, you sure you got
the right company?

09:26.200 --> 09:27.230
Only one serves the area.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.730
I think somebody
was trying to get

09:31.770 --> 09:33.340
into Ethan Burdick's
computer system.

09:33.370 --> 09:34.140
- You mean, like, a hacker?
- Yeah.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.600
The mom booked
clowns and rentals

09:35.640 --> 09:37.240
through the party
company's Web site.

09:37.270 --> 09:38.610
All right, let's just say

09:38.640 --> 09:40.780
they're after
this Riemann Hypothesis thing.

09:40.810 --> 09:42.610
I mean, getting
into Ethan's system

09:42.650 --> 09:45.150
would certainly tell them
how far along he is.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.280
Right?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.620
It's Paul Ballard--
the clown.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.320
Who's Paul Ballard?

09:50.350 --> 09:53.390
Now, you investigated this guy
for two other kidnappings?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.320
TERRY: Yeah.
Wife of a bank president,

09:55.360 --> 09:57.330
15-year-old son of
a security company chief.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.490
Couldn't make a case
either time.

09:58.530 --> 10:00.730
Wife's body was found, boy's
body was never recovered.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.570
Match is 93%--
that's pretty good

10:02.600 --> 10:04.200
considering the heavy makeup.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.300
Good catch Terry, you
were right.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.300
I should've
seen it sooner.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.270
We sent him away

10:08.300 --> 10:09.640
for tax evasion
before you got to L.A.

10:09.670 --> 10:10.810
Best we could do.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.480
There was an early
release initiative

10:12.510 --> 10:13.810
at McNeill
Correctional Institute.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.580
Ballard got out. No parole.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.260
Hello.
Hey.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.730
Tell me you found
Emily Burdick.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.930
No, I'm sorry, buddy,
not yet.

10:29.960 --> 10:30.930
ALAN: Hey, take
a look at this.

10:30.960 --> 10:31.930
Here in
the kitchen,

10:31.960 --> 10:32.760
I put in the new sink
myself,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.230
and the, uh... I
did the tile work.

10:34.260 --> 10:35.930
WOMAN:
Oh, it's beautiful work.

10:35.970 --> 10:39.170
I like how you've preserved
the original Craftsman detail.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.970
- Oh, hey, boys.
- Hi.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.040
We didn't know
you were home.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.840
Meredith, my two sons--
this is Don and Charlie.

10:45.880 --> 10:46.940
- How are you?
- Hi, Don.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.140
Nice to meet you.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.350
- Pleasure.
- Hello, Charlie.

10:49.380 --> 10:52.680
Oh, Meredith, would you mind
going upstairs for a minute?

10:52.720 --> 10:53.280
I'll be right with you.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.260
Sure.

10:54.440 --> 10:58.140
Um... Um...
What?

10:58.280 --> 10:59.360
Nice. She's cute.

10:59.380 --> 11:00.890
- What's going on?
- What is this?

11:00.920 --> 11:01.830
Oh, come on, Charlie.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.230
Don't you remember
we talked about this?

11:03.260 --> 11:04.430
Talked about what? No.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.930
I'm sorry, I should
have made sure

11:05.960 --> 11:07.400
you were paying attention
when I was ta...

11:07.430 --> 11:09.200
- Don't apologize, Dad.
- No, you have no idea

11:09.230 --> 11:10.770
what this is all about,
trust me.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.300
I don't think
we want to know.

11:12.340 --> 11:13.970
- Well, you have to know.
- No, we don't, Dad.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.840
Look, you're allowed
to have a private life.

11:15.870 --> 11:19.480
Wait a minute. Just hold it a
second. This is not a date.

11:19.510 --> 11:22.210
Oh, my... Dad,
what are you telling me?

11:22.250 --> 11:24.050
That this woman is a pr...

11:24.080 --> 11:25.080
Real estate agent.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.980
- Oh, right.
- I'm confu...

11:27.020 --> 11:28.280
Are you dating
a real estate agent?

11:28.320 --> 11:29.490
No, he's selling
the house.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.890
- Yes...
- Why? I-I live here.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.320
- Don't you remember?
- You live here.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.460
Don't you remember?

11:33.490 --> 11:35.020
I said I wanted to find
a smaller place

11:35.060 --> 11:37.060
- for myself, maybe a condo.
- I remember that, sure.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.160
You need a place of your own.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.260
But I didn't think
you were serious.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.060
- You can't sell our house.
- What are you saying?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.400
- This is our house.
- Look, the market is...

11:42.430 --> 11:43.930
the market is at
its peak right now.

11:43.970 --> 11:44.970
Yeah, but I live here.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.170
We are living...
we are living on

11:46.200 --> 11:47.740
a very large part of
my retirement savings.

11:47.770 --> 11:48.870
He's right.
Prices are high.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.140
Believe me,
I've looked around.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.110
Can we...
do me a favor...

11:51.140 --> 11:52.910
I like how it looks upstairs;
it's great.

11:52.940 --> 11:53.980
I love the solarium.

11:54.010 --> 11:55.140
Oh, you haven't
seen the outside.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.780
I do my best work
in the solarium.

11:56.810 --> 11:58.080
( loud clanging thump )

11:58.110 --> 11:59.120
Oh, that's
the heating system.

11:59.150 --> 12:00.280
It's a little
temperamental.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.480
It needs a
little finessing.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.890
I'll show you later.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.250
Just wanted you
to see this here,

12:04.290 --> 12:06.220
at the front of the house,
we have, uh...

12:06.260 --> 12:07.920
( door shuts )

12:07.960 --> 12:08.930
Look, relax.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.090
I got a great apartment
in a great neighborhood.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.030
You'll find one, too.

12:12.060 --> 12:14.200
Then why are you over here
all the time?

12:14.230 --> 12:15.160
Because I'm
making sure

12:15.200 --> 12:17.130
you let Dad have a life.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.140
( doorbell ringing )

12:29.480 --> 12:31.380
- Mrs. Burdick...
- Agent Lake.

12:31.410 --> 12:34.150
I need a minute
of your time, please.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.950
Have you ever seen this man?

12:38.890 --> 12:40.490
No.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.090
I think this is the man
that has Emily.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.130
He's kidnapped before
and gotten away with it.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.430
- Ethan says...
- You need to let us help you.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.100
Ethan says
he can get Emily back.

12:50.130 --> 12:51.300
Your husband thinks

12:51.330 --> 12:53.070
that he is in control
of something

12:53.100 --> 12:55.500
he is definitely
not in control of.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.070
These other kidnappings--

12:58.110 --> 13:00.210
did those families
cooperate with you?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.380
Yes.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.110
But you say he
got away with it.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.110
And he's still out there,

13:04.150 --> 13:05.080
and he's taken our daughter.

13:05.110 --> 13:07.520
With your help,
we can get him this time.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.150
I don't care about him,
Agent Lake.

13:09.190 --> 13:10.950
I care about Emily.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.390
My husband, the smartest man
I have ever met...

13:16.260 --> 13:18.590
when he says he knows
what he's doing, I believe him.

13:18.630 --> 13:19.900
Mrs. Burdick...

13:32.240 --> 13:35.510
Okay, what's the biggest number
you can think of?

13:35.540 --> 13:38.580
Um, a gazillion--
is that a real number?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.280
( laughs ):
No.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.090
A quadrillion.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.290
Quadrillion--
that's 1,000 trillion,

13:45.320 --> 13:48.490
or 1 followed by 15 0's.

13:48.520 --> 13:51.290
Or it can be written like this.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.200
Now, this is how many protons

13:53.230 --> 13:55.560
are in
the entire known universe.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.870
And this is the
size of the numbers

13:58.900 --> 14:02.010
used to encrypt
Internet transactions.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.340
Huge numbers.

14:03.370 --> 14:05.240
But for encryption,

14:05.270 --> 14:07.110
we don't use just big numbers.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.950
We use big numbers
that are built

14:08.980 --> 14:10.650
by multiplying
large prime numbers,

14:10.680 --> 14:13.450
because, see, primes
are the basic building blocks

14:13.480 --> 14:14.550
of mathematics.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.550
And as far as we know,

14:16.590 --> 14:21.320
they occur at random intervals
along the number line.

14:24.490 --> 14:27.200
Because of that,
it's incredibly hard

14:27.230 --> 14:29.300
to take a giant number apart

14:29.330 --> 14:33.100
and break it down
to its prime components, okay?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.470
I mean, that's basically
how Internet security works.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.870
A large, unknown prime number

14:36.910 --> 14:39.610
hidden inside a giant number
that can't be broken down.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.110
DAVID:
So, the reason hackers
can't break the encryptions

14:42.150 --> 14:44.110
is because of the sheer
complexity of the math?

14:44.150 --> 14:45.980
Exactly, and it is complex.

14:46.020 --> 14:48.080
In 1977, three mathematicians

14:48.120 --> 14:51.250
challenged the readers
of Scientific American

14:51.290 --> 14:53.320
to factor a 129-digit number.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.330
It took hundreds of people
17 years to do it.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.530
What does this have to do
with Burdick's Reimann thing?

14:59.560 --> 15:01.300
His work
can help find large primes,

15:01.330 --> 15:04.370
making it easier to create
what we call a "number sieve--"

15:04.400 --> 15:09.210
a tool that takes this and
finds the primes that built it.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.310
Once you have that,

15:10.340 --> 15:13.380
you can find the decryption
constant and get in--

15:13.410 --> 15:15.140
into people's bank accounts,

15:15.180 --> 15:17.310
into their credit card
transactions,

15:17.350 --> 15:19.280
practically any secure website.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.680
Wait a minute.
That's why they took the girl.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.190
It's not Burdick's money
they're after;

15:24.220 --> 15:26.190
it's everyone's.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.630
TERRY: That's why Ballard
took the girl.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.560
She's his tool to
get the big score.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.070
Look at this;
he's in the wind.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.600
Phony addresses,
offshore accounts,

15:37.630 --> 15:39.340
bogus P.O. boxes.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.500
Terry, let me
ask you something.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.640
- Yeah?
- What happened?

15:42.670 --> 15:44.040
What's the deal?

15:44.070 --> 15:45.640
This guy got under
your skin or something?

15:45.670 --> 15:46.640
Yeah, uh... I was there

15:46.680 --> 15:49.350
when the found the bank
president's wife's body.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.610
Got a two-week
suspension for running

15:50.650 --> 15:52.120
the Ballard tax case on my own.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.180
Assistant Director said
I was on a vendetta.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.650
And were you?

15:54.680 --> 15:57.190
Yeah, probably.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.560
Well, look, first of all,
a guy like Ballard's

15:59.590 --> 16:01.520
going to need someone
with computer skills

16:01.560 --> 16:03.590
and an advanced
knowledge of math

16:03.630 --> 16:04.490
to pull something
like this off.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.130
Maybe he's got a crew
that consists of

16:06.160 --> 16:07.200
a hacker
and a mathematician.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.560
Here's an idea on the hacker.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.700
I searched for people
who did jail time with

16:10.730 --> 16:11.930
Paul Ballard,
checked against

16:11.970 --> 16:14.200
records for computer crimes.
Came up with Carl Mittendorf.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.540
Mittendorf.

16:15.570 --> 16:18.070
I remember this kid.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.380
financial newsletter, right?ig

16:20.410 --> 16:22.280
Yeah, right.

16:22.310 --> 16:24.450
Made investments off what they
were going to recommend.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.750
Nailed by the SEC
for insider trading.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.680
Let me guess--
his cellmate was Paul Ballard?

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
Well, let's
pick him up.

16:28.750 --> 16:29.650
We can't.

16:29.690 --> 16:30.880
Skipped his last two
parole appointments.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.000
Police got no leads
on his whereabouts.

16:35.590 --> 16:37.730
Do you guys know anything
about a hacker

16:37.760 --> 16:38.300
named Carl Mittendorf?

16:38.360 --> 16:39.160
- Mittendorf?
- Yes.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.380
Sure. He's good.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.900
He's famous
for hacking

16:41.930 --> 16:43.530
into his math professor's
computer

16:43.570 --> 16:44.670
and changing
the grades.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.870
Poor Dr. Atwood, yes,
already infamous

16:46.900 --> 16:49.970
for his failure to prove
the Reimann Hypothesis.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.280
Atwood-- you mean
Steven Atwood?

16:52.310 --> 16:53.610
Yeah, that's him.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.350
Carl Mittendorf took
classes from Atwood?

16:55.380 --> 16:57.780
They know each other?

16:57.810 --> 16:59.420
Thank you.

17:06.990 --> 17:07.960
Now, Dad,
I've been checking around.

17:07.990 --> 17:10.790
You were right about the house.
You were right.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.600
Yeah, the real estate lady
said that this property

17:13.630 --> 17:16.270
on the current market,
I can expect competing bids.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.670
Dad, am I, uh...?

17:22.110 --> 17:23.640
Do I bug you?

17:23.670 --> 17:26.780
What?
What kind of a question is that?

17:26.810 --> 17:30.180
Well, it's just, you know--
my math work, and uh...

17:30.210 --> 17:31.480
( clearing throat )

17:31.510 --> 17:34.350
I never listen, and I'm always
in my own world.

17:34.380 --> 17:35.420
Well,

17:35.450 --> 17:37.190
that sort of makes you

17:37.220 --> 17:39.460
the ideal housemate,
doesn't it, Charlie?

17:39.490 --> 17:41.590
Hmm. Well,

17:41.620 --> 17:43.460
I just wanted to make sure.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.290
Make sure of what?

17:45.330 --> 17:46.630
You're selling the house

17:46.660 --> 17:48.800
because you want to do it
for... yourself.

17:48.830 --> 17:51.730
No, Charlie, I want to do it
for both of us.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.440
I thought we were having
a good time.

17:54.470 --> 17:55.670
We are.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.810
It's just that this house
is so big,

17:57.840 --> 18:00.780
and it takes so much work
to maintain it.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.610
And besides, you're almost 30.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.610
Don't you think
it's about time

18:04.650 --> 18:06.450
you found a place
of your own?

18:06.480 --> 18:08.380
I love this house.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.550
So do I.

18:11.990 --> 18:15.390
But still, the both of us,
we have to move on.

18:17.790 --> 18:19.030
Let's just put it together.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.600
DAVID: Burdick tells Atwood
he's cracked Riemann's.

18:21.630 --> 18:24.230
Atwood sees potential for a
heist, tells Carl Mittendorf.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.140
TERRY: Mittendorf calls Paul
Ballard, the kidnap specialist.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.100
Well, we'll try one more time

18:28.140 --> 18:30.140
to see if we can get Burdick
to cooperate.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.780
If we can be there
for the hand-off...

18:31.810 --> 18:33.240
I mean, you know,
we might get lucky

18:33.280 --> 18:34.810
and they'll lead us
right to the kid.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.310
Burdick thinks he can
do this without us,

18:36.350 --> 18:37.810
we won't get
in the front door.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.120
Well...

18:39.150 --> 18:40.680
maybe Charlie will.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.800
What the he...?!

18:57.830 --> 18:59.770
Uh, Becky!

18:59.800 --> 19:01.140
Becky!

19:01.170 --> 19:02.840
I told her I was here
to help you.

19:02.870 --> 19:05.110
But you're not. You're here to
talk your brother in the door.

19:05.140 --> 19:06.810
And in case you
haven't realized it,

19:06.840 --> 19:08.650
I don't have time
to waste.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.780
I think you'd be better off
letting him do his job

19:10.810 --> 19:12.780
because he's actually
pretty good at it.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.780
They've figured out
that the kidnappers

19:14.820 --> 19:16.720
want your proof
on the Riemann Hypothesis,

19:16.750 --> 19:17.890
your work on number sieves.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.930
Well, that's not exactly
the stuff of Sherlock Holmes.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.790
They're going to use
its capabilities

19:23.830 --> 19:24.990
to break
Internet encryption.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.580
Which means...

19:27.900 --> 19:31.000
they'll expect you to distill it
down to an algorithm.

19:31.030 --> 19:35.270
That would be a huge job
under normal circumstances,

19:35.300 --> 19:38.270
But Ethan, with a time limit,
the stress of your daughter's...

19:38.310 --> 19:39.180
Yeah, I know that,

19:39.210 --> 19:40.980
I know, okay?

19:41.010 --> 19:44.080
15 years of work...
my life's work...

19:44.110 --> 19:45.180
and I have to process it

19:45.210 --> 19:48.250
into an algorithm for people
who don't give a damn.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.290
it's like a part of me is dying.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.350
I understand that.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.190
More than that,
more than anything,

19:54.220 --> 19:56.990
I-I need to get Emily back.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.140
Let me help you.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.770
I'm not suggesting
a collaboration.

20:09.810 --> 20:11.170
It's obviously

20:11.210 --> 20:12.110
all your work...

20:12.140 --> 20:14.680
I don't care about
that anymore. It's...

20:20.780 --> 20:22.220
I need your help.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.650
Well, you got it.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.160
( sighs )

20:52.820 --> 20:54.950
( sobbing )

21:07.800 --> 21:09.230
Ah, here's
the next section.

21:09.270 --> 21:10.200
Okay.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.240
Oh, okay, yeah, no,
I see how this works...

21:13.270 --> 21:15.400
I'm sorry,
I see.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.440
But, um...

21:16.470 --> 21:18.270
see, um... I'm still not so sure

21:18.310 --> 21:20.240
that I follow
from this point...

21:20.280 --> 21:21.440
how we get to here.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.310
See what
I'm saying?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.320
I-I think I...
I have another...

21:26.350 --> 21:27.320
there's another notebook.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.380
Okay.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.330
CHARLIE:
Hmm.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.060
What's wrong?

21:40.100 --> 21:42.430
This material
for the number sieve...

21:42.470 --> 21:44.770
I don't see how
a working algorithm

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
can be built from this.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.900
I don't see

21:46.940 --> 21:48.400
anything that supports
the expansion

21:48.440 --> 21:49.740
of the zero-free region

21:49.770 --> 21:52.410
into the
critical strip.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.810
Ethan?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.880
Uh... I don't...

21:55.910 --> 21:57.950
I'm not really sure...

21:57.980 --> 22:00.520
Ethan, all your conclusions
emanate from this point.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.050
If it's not fairly solid,

22:02.090 --> 22:03.820
we can't get to
where we need to go.

22:03.850 --> 22:06.290
I know.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.230
It doesn't work.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.800
It doesn't work, it...

22:18.840 --> 22:20.870
it needs... we have...

22:20.900 --> 22:23.040
It has to work,
so we need to fix it.

22:23.070 --> 22:24.340
You and I--
we have to fix this.

22:24.370 --> 22:25.470
It's a 150-year-old
math problem.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.010
You know,
we can't just solve it

22:27.040 --> 22:28.480
because we want to
or because we need to.

22:28.510 --> 22:30.180
How about because
my daughter's life

22:30.210 --> 22:32.080
depends on it?

22:32.120 --> 22:35.250
How about because she's going
to die when they realize...

22:35.280 --> 22:36.450
there's nothing?

22:38.920 --> 22:41.260
There's nothing.

22:41.290 --> 22:44.360
There's nothing to give them
for her life.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.870
They bought me some games,

22:54.900 --> 22:58.040
and they let me eat
whatever I want,

22:58.070 --> 22:59.880
like pizza.

22:59.910 --> 23:02.210
But I miss you.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.380
They said I can come home

23:04.410 --> 23:08.050
if Daddy helped them
with a math problem.

23:08.080 --> 23:12.390
And you can do it, Daddy,
'cause you're the best at math.

23:12.420 --> 23:15.220
I told them.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.560
( transmission stops )

23:16.590 --> 23:18.060
TERRY:
When did this come in?

23:18.090 --> 23:19.900
A few hours
after I asked you to leave.

23:19.930 --> 23:20.800
The man on the phone said

23:20.830 --> 23:22.570
to distill the theorems
into an algorithm,

23:22.600 --> 23:23.900
that we'd be contacted later.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.400
( under his breath ): All right,
explain something to me.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.570
So he was lying
the whole time?

23:27.600 --> 23:30.370
No, he wasn't lying. He was
convinced that he had it.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.540
And you can't do it?

23:32.580 --> 23:34.180
Don, you just asked me to solve

23:34.210 --> 23:36.910
one of the world's biggest
mysteries in a few hours.

23:36.950 --> 23:38.310
Charlie, you got me
thinking you can do

23:38.350 --> 23:40.220
- anything with numbers.
- No.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.020
What do you think
we should do now?

23:42.050 --> 23:44.620
Well, same thing I did
when I was in school

23:44.650 --> 23:46.460
and I didn't know the answer--

23:47.040 --> 23:47.920
fake it.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.560
Ethan, look, we're going
to do everything we can

23:50.590 --> 23:52.600
- to get your girl back.
- How?

23:52.630 --> 23:53.930
We're going
to give them Reimann's.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.100
But I don't have it.

23:55.130 --> 23:56.270
Yeah, well,
you got something

23:56.300 --> 23:57.600
that looks
a hell of a lot like it.

23:57.630 --> 23:58.730
My brother's right.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.440
We can work off your principles
and compose an algorithm

24:01.470 --> 24:03.610
that should be able
to pass initial scrutiny.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.570
So you'll
make the drop,

24:04.610 --> 24:06.440
and we're going
to track it.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.610
Thank you.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.550
Ah, you can thank me
when we're done.

24:16.620 --> 24:17.590
Now, Charles,

24:17.620 --> 24:20.120
I've been thinking about
your housing situation.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.630
If your father
sells the house,

24:22.660 --> 24:25.630
I have 800 square
feet I'm not using.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.630
Yeah, there's certainly
room enough for you

24:27.660 --> 24:28.600
in that huge, old place.

24:28.630 --> 24:29.970
Huge, old place?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.600
It's 1877 Victorian

24:31.630 --> 24:34.470
that I've restored
inside, outside.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.010
My equity has soared
exponentially

24:37.040 --> 24:38.140
in the last ten years.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.480
That's why my dad's selling.

24:39.510 --> 24:41.140
All the equity on the home.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.480
There it is. I got it.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.480
Hey,

24:43.510 --> 24:45.650
you just said you wanted
something to eat, right?

24:45.680 --> 24:46.680
- You're hungry?
- Sure.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.050
Come with me.
Come-come with me.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.160
Kyono?

24:54.190 --> 24:55.320
Yeah?

24:55.360 --> 24:56.660
Special Agent
David Sinclair.

24:56.690 --> 24:57.990
Oh, too bad.

24:58.030 --> 24:58.860
You have nice eyes.

24:58.890 --> 25:00.700
I'd like to ask you
a few questions

25:00.730 --> 25:01.600
about Carl Mittendorf.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.700
Do you guys have,
like, a file for me

25:03.730 --> 25:05.500
under "ex-girlfriend"
or something?

25:05.530 --> 25:07.170
Have you seen Carl recently?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.510
No. He got busted,
I got scarce.

25:09.540 --> 25:10.640
Did he ever
attempt to contact you

25:10.670 --> 25:12.010
when he was in prison?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.180
He tried.

25:13.210 --> 25:14.640
Wanted to get together
when he got out,

25:14.680 --> 25:17.010
which was not
going to happen.

25:17.050 --> 25:18.650
Why not?
What was he into?

25:18.680 --> 25:20.350
Look,

25:20.380 --> 25:23.020
I don't really like the guy,
he's a bit of a creep,

25:23.050 --> 25:25.350
which I found out the hard way,
but I don't want

25:25.390 --> 25:26.660
to get him in trouble.

25:26.690 --> 25:27.790
I mean, he's harmless.

25:27.820 --> 25:31.060
He spouts off all the time
about stuff he never does.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.530
Kyono, he's not harmless.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.200
The life of a small child
might be at stake.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.640
Carl? No way.

25:42.710 --> 25:45.370
He always had these big schemes,

25:45.410 --> 25:48.210
but he wound up
doing stupid, little stuff.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.010
He called me
right before he got out.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.020
He said he'd gotten in
on something really big.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.150
Like that was going
to impress me or something.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.480
Do you know
what this big thing is?

25:55.520 --> 25:58.020
Something about
the biggest hacking job ever.

26:00.260 --> 26:03.190
Said he was going after
the biggest financial secret

26:03.230 --> 26:05.660
in the world.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.700
The world's
biggest financial secret.

26:09.730 --> 26:12.400
That you get by breaking
Internet encryption.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.700
Some huge merger,
acquisition?

26:14.740 --> 26:17.570
FDA approval of a new drug?

26:17.610 --> 26:19.410
No, that's a large
single point investment.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.080
The SEC
would be all over that.

26:22.110 --> 26:23.750
Financial secret
that would allow you

26:23.780 --> 26:25.750
to make a broad range
of investments

26:25.780 --> 26:27.550
that can't be traced
back to you.

26:31.620 --> 26:32.720
Hey.
Hey.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.690
DON:
How's it coming?

26:33.720 --> 26:36.060
CHARLIE: Good. The way
we're setting it up,

26:36.090 --> 26:38.090
it'll take Atwood a while
to notice it's incomplete.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.130
DON:
How you doing, Ethan?

26:39.160 --> 26:41.430
So, wait, I can't believe
Stephen's involved.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.570
He was my colleague,
my friend.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.300
Well, look, we've checked
into his financial status.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.370
In the last two months,
your friend liquidated

26:47.400 --> 26:48.540
all of his assets
which definitely

26:48.570 --> 26:51.270
gave him enough cash on hand
to make some investments.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.140
So when we finish this,
what's the next step?

26:53.180 --> 26:55.140
Well, whatever they ask.
We take the information,

26:55.180 --> 26:56.650
we give them the formula.
We just have to make sure

26:56.680 --> 26:58.580
we have enough time
before they figure out

26:58.610 --> 27:00.350
it's not going to work, right?

27:00.380 --> 27:01.680
They're going to factor
big numbers, so they'll

27:01.720 --> 27:03.150
need to use a supercomputer.

27:03.190 --> 27:05.090
But there's only
so many of them.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.590
But we can monitor
who's using them

27:06.620 --> 27:08.620
during the time
they need to run the algorithm.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.790
Unless they built their own.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.660
Wait, you can build
a supercomputer?

27:12.700 --> 27:14.330
Yeah, by linking a lot of
smaller computers together,

27:14.360 --> 27:15.600
using them for parallel
processing.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.130
Then we're looking
for someone

27:17.170 --> 27:18.670
who bought a lot
of high-end computer equipment?

27:18.700 --> 27:20.800
It'll also pull a lot
of electrical power,

27:20.840 --> 27:22.810
about 200,000 watts.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.410
The DEA tracks
high electrical usage,

27:24.440 --> 27:25.740
looking for marijuana growers.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.080
Oh, yeah? How would you know
something like that?

27:28.110 --> 27:29.810
I read an article
in The New Yorker.

27:29.850 --> 27:32.780
Be hard to keep a
supercomputer cool.

27:32.820 --> 27:36.250
It requires
units of liquid Freon.

27:36.290 --> 27:38.820
All right, well,
we can track that.

27:38.850 --> 27:39.760
Excuse me.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.490
( sotto voce ): This just
arrived by messenger.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.330
Dropped at the
messenger company.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.730
No witnesses.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.670
( distorted voice on tape):
We will know in 12 hours

27:52.700 --> 27:54.500
from delivery
if the solution works.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.810
If it doesn't...

27:56.840 --> 28:00.680
your daughter dies.

28:00.710 --> 28:03.180
So put everything
on computer files

28:03.210 --> 28:08.850
and call 818-555-4275.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.160
By 6:00 tonight.

28:13.590 --> 28:16.330
Was it all right that time?

28:27.370 --> 28:29.840
That gives us 14 hours.

28:29.870 --> 28:31.870
With no hand-off.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.380
It's an Internet hand-off.

28:33.410 --> 28:35.580
If we can trace
where they're coming from.

28:35.610 --> 28:37.180
A hacker
with Mittendorf's skills,

28:37.210 --> 28:38.310
won't be easy or likely.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.620
( crying ):
You said, if we cooperated...

28:40.650 --> 28:42.590
you said
we'd get our daughter back.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.750
Ma'am, we're doing
everything we can.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.320
I think there's a way.

28:49.690 --> 28:52.400
Reimann's
is a master key--

28:52.430 --> 28:54.430
it opens all doors.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.330
Doesn't it, Ethan?

28:56.370 --> 28:58.870
Well, they have a plan
to open just one door--

28:58.900 --> 29:02.210
it's a really important door.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.770
Now,
we can't give them

29:03.810 --> 29:06.410
the master key, but we can
open that door for them

29:06.440 --> 29:09.280
by creating a false master key.

29:09.310 --> 29:12.250
And by designing
the lock it opens.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.420
If we can figure out

29:13.450 --> 29:15.680
what door it is
they're trying to open.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.190
Yeah, the
question becomes

29:17.220 --> 29:19.660
what's the world's
biggest financial secret?

29:27.660 --> 29:30.030
Say this... this is
the financial information

29:30.070 --> 29:33.000
that the kidnappers
want, right?

29:33.040 --> 29:34.200
And then,
um, this here...

29:34.240 --> 29:37.670
yeah, here,

29:37.710 --> 29:39.510
that's the Internet location

29:39.540 --> 29:40.610
where it can be found.
Okay?

29:40.640 --> 29:41.550
Yeah.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.580
So once we know what this is,
we can...

29:44.810 --> 29:47.720
build a security wall around it.

29:47.750 --> 29:50.150
With our own special lock,

29:50.190 --> 29:52.160
designed only to respond

29:52.190 --> 29:54.160
to the false key
that we will provide them with.

29:54.190 --> 29:55.690
That way, when they try
to access this...

29:55.730 --> 29:58.800
We catch them with their hand in
the Internet cookie jar.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.170
They think they've cracked the
system, but it's a set-up.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.330
We know they're coming.
We can watch for the break-in,

30:03.370 --> 30:04.770
then track them back
through the net

30:04.800 --> 30:06.470
by marking the data
we know they've taken.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.040
Forcing them to leave
a cyber trail.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.170
Yeah, but it
still doesn't deal

30:10.210 --> 30:12.140
with the fact that we don't
know what they're after.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.640
We know Ballard likes big
payoffs that can't be traced.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.520
It's interest rates.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.690
Dad wants to sell the house,
because he's worried

30:23.720 --> 30:25.420
that interest rates are
going to go up.

30:25.460 --> 30:27.660
DAVID: The Federal Reserve
Board's announcement's due

30:27.690 --> 30:30.130
in, like, two days. I mean,
that's a full 24 hours after

30:30.160 --> 30:31.700
the kidnappers' deadline.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.800
With the information classified
until the actual announcement.

30:33.830 --> 30:35.600
The prime interest rate affects

30:35.630 --> 30:38.740
the cost of bonds and currency,
precious metals, real estate.

30:38.770 --> 30:39.640
If he knows about
it in advance,

30:39.670 --> 30:41.570
he can make investments
across the board--

30:41.610 --> 30:43.670
foreign currencies,
foreign commodity markets--

30:43.710 --> 30:45.610
extremely profitable,
impossible to track.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.580
We should see if they set up
any accounts

30:47.610 --> 30:48.680
in any of those areas.

30:48.710 --> 30:49.780
And we should also get
our people

30:49.810 --> 30:52.320
building a fake interface
to the Federal Reserve.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.470
How are we doing?

31:08.500 --> 31:09.870
We built
the false key.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.700
Amita's creating
a transparent tracer

31:12.740 --> 31:15.310
that's silently pinging
the kidnappers' computer.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.370
( phone rings )

31:16.410 --> 31:17.740
Yeah. Eppes.

31:17.770 --> 31:20.480
Hey, we're on track with
the Federal Reserve rate.

31:20.510 --> 31:22.710
Atwood just opened up a range
of new accounts--

31:22.750 --> 31:24.250
commodities, precious metals,

31:24.280 --> 31:25.820
treasury bonds,
mortgage companies,

31:25.850 --> 31:28.490
poised to profit off a change
in the prime rate.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.620
Anything with Ballard?

31:29.650 --> 31:32.160
Nothing. Guy like that knows
how to cover his tracks.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.190
You all right?

31:33.220 --> 31:34.890
Yeah.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.730
Terry, we're going
to get this guy.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.500
Okay?

31:38.530 --> 31:40.530
David, you there?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.830
Yep. We're monitoring traffic
on the Fed's database.

31:42.870 --> 31:45.670
Anybody goes fishing for
classified interest rate data,

31:45.700 --> 31:46.670
we'll know it.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.880
( phone rings )

31:58.920 --> 32:00.080
The number you have reached

32:00.120 --> 32:02.920
is not in service at this time,
and there is no new number.

32:02.950 --> 32:05.720
Please be sure you have
checked the telephone directory

32:05.760 --> 32:06.860
for the right...

32:06.890 --> 32:09.930
Carl Mittendorf knows how
to work the phone system.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.830
They know we called.
Trust me.

32:11.860 --> 32:12.760
Sir, here we go.

32:17.930 --> 32:19.270
All right, send it.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.640
( typing )

32:25.210 --> 32:26.110
Whoa.

32:26.140 --> 32:27.810
CHARLIE: Should take them
several hours

32:27.840 --> 32:29.480
to generate
an encryption key.

32:29.510 --> 32:31.680
Then they'll think they have
what they need

32:31.720 --> 32:33.150
to crack the Federal Reserve.

32:42.660 --> 32:43.660
( beeping )

32:43.690 --> 32:44.890
They're here.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.930
Someone's just come in

32:46.960 --> 32:48.830
They've got the fake
encryption key,

32:48.870 --> 32:50.900
and they're coming in
via the false firewalls.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.240
He's walking right in.

32:56.270 --> 32:57.810
Lock and key fit
together perfectly.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.310
What's he going after?

33:00.540 --> 33:01.710
The classified

33:01.750 --> 33:03.480
prime interest rate,
just like you guys said.

33:03.510 --> 33:04.450
Great.

33:13.760 --> 33:14.820
He's out.
Got a location?!

33:17.890 --> 33:20.360
It's down to two cell towers.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.870
He broke off.

33:24.900 --> 33:26.770
He's gone.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.940
We've got a residence
on the power drain list.

33:28.970 --> 33:31.280
Cross-check it with the list
for Freon purchases.

33:36.910 --> 33:38.380
It's there. We got it.

33:38.420 --> 33:39.920
Good, grab it. Let's go.

33:55.930 --> 33:57.470
MAN:
He's got it, definitely.

33:58.740 --> 34:01.610
( garbled voice )

34:01.640 --> 34:05.780
...the Federal Reserve is going
to up the prime interest rate--

34:05.810 --> 34:08.810
oh, you'll like this--
by a full half point.

34:08.850 --> 34:10.550
Between bonds,
foreign currency,

34:10.580 --> 34:13.620
precious metals,
we're looking at making 200,

34:13.650 --> 34:15.520
maybe $300 million.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.590
There's Mittendorf.

34:17.620 --> 34:22.290
Anyone got a sign
on the girl?

34:22.330 --> 34:25.600
You know what? I think you guys
should get your team in place.

34:28.330 --> 34:29.630
Something's off.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.940
Feels like the algorithms
are incomplete.

34:31.970 --> 34:33.070
Ballard...

34:33.100 --> 34:35.270
we've got him.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.480
Don't need Carl
and the Professor anymore.

34:40.510 --> 34:44.050
Get rid of them.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.180
Let's get to the airport.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.850
We'll start moving
the money once we...

34:46.880 --> 34:48.920
All right, I want to go.
Let's move, let's move.

34:48.950 --> 34:50.350
All units, let's move,
let's move.

34:55.490 --> 34:57.430
Look, um, I-I
don't like this.

34:57.460 --> 34:58.860
Relax. No, no. Relax.

34:58.900 --> 35:01.430
MITTENDORF:
Please... have a beer.

35:01.470 --> 35:03.770
While you're at it,
get me one, too.

35:22.150 --> 35:24.450
Where's the professor?

35:24.490 --> 35:27.020
Whoa. Calm down,
I was just cleaning it.

35:27.060 --> 35:29.660
I-I don't, I don't know where
he, he just...

35:29.690 --> 35:30.990
he went to get me a beer.

35:31.030 --> 35:33.030
Let's get back to work.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.440
Execute, exec...

35:43.170 --> 35:44.510
FBI! Warrant!

35:44.540 --> 35:46.840
- FBI! Warrant!
- Warrant!

35:46.880 --> 35:49.650
FBI!
Don't move, get back!

35:49.680 --> 35:51.050
FBI! Warrant! FBI!

35:51.080 --> 35:53.520
- Get on the floor!
- Don't move!

35:53.550 --> 35:58.150
F-B-I! Get down!
You! Get down!

35:58.190 --> 36:02.560
- You got my thumb?!
- I got your thumb.

36:02.590 --> 36:05.400
- Door clear.
- Get on the floor!

36:05.430 --> 36:07.000
- Where's Ballard?
- Where's the girl?

36:07.030 --> 36:08.930
- She's in the basement.
- I've got Atwood.

36:08.970 --> 36:12.040
( over radio ):
The girl's in the basement.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.720
Hey, Emily, come here.
I'm here to take you home.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.120
No you're not.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.520
Back away.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.190
Put her down.

36:35.220 --> 36:36.590
Back up!

36:36.630 --> 36:37.600
Just put the gun down.

36:37.740 --> 36:39.800
Don't even think about it.
Put your weapons down.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.300
It's not going to happen.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.070
TERRY:
I have a shot. I can take him.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.640
I'm telling you right now,
it's not going to happen.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.550
Put her down,
or you're dead.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.920
Come here, sweetie.

37:09.260 --> 37:12.200
Come on, sweetie.
There you go. I got you.

37:16.030 --> 37:16.970
I gotcha.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.180
Hey, look who I got.
We're taking her home.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.740
Hey.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.780
I remember you...

37:28.810 --> 37:30.510
I was kind of
hoping you would.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.620
Get him out of here.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.340
Emily!
Emily!

37:49.430 --> 37:51.100
Mommy! Daddy!

37:51.140 --> 37:52.440
Hi, honey.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.270
Mommy, daddy!

37:54.300 --> 37:56.870
- You okay honey?
-I missed you!

37:56.910 --> 37:58.180
Thank you so much.

37:58.210 --> 37:59.180
Oh, thank you.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.480
Come here.

38:00.510 --> 38:04.180
Missed you so much.
Are you okay?

38:04.210 --> 38:05.350
ETHAN:
Did they hurt you?

38:05.380 --> 38:07.820
I bet you were so scared!

38:12.660 --> 38:15.560
ALAN: How is it I always end up
loading the dishwasher?

38:15.590 --> 38:18.400
You were the one that
wanted to flip a coin.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.360
I know, but I lost
the last five times.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.300
And what's the odds
of that happening?

38:22.330 --> 38:24.870
Never mind.
Don't tell me.

38:27.470 --> 38:29.820
You know, I did get
an offer on the house.

38:30.360 --> 38:30.960
Actually, it was

38:31.040 --> 38:32.180
a great offer.

38:32.300 --> 38:33.320
Oh, yeah?

38:33.460 --> 38:34.680
Yeah.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.680
The buyer didn't
even have

38:36.710 --> 38:37.810
to take out a mortgage.

38:37.850 --> 38:39.150
He's, uh, paying real cash.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.180
That's great.

38:40.220 --> 38:42.890
Charlie,
I'm accepting the offer.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.520
Glad to hear that.

38:44.780 --> 38:45.960
Really?

38:49.880 --> 38:52.830
You, uh... you're
all right with this?

38:52.860 --> 38:54.860
Well, it's like you said.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.500
I need to find my own place.
I agree.

38:57.530 --> 38:59.700
And being a tenured professor,

38:59.740 --> 39:02.240
I have money, enough
to buy a house

39:02.270 --> 39:03.070
that I like.

39:03.110 --> 39:04.840
Well, you know,
today's market...

39:04.870 --> 39:07.380
I know you make
a good salary, but...

39:07.410 --> 39:08.750
And I also do a lot
of consulting,

39:08.780 --> 39:09.950
and not just for the FBI.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.750
Plus I've won
all sorts of awards.

39:11.780 --> 39:14.750
And you never have to pay
any of it out for rent,

39:14.780 --> 39:17.850
or food or utilities.

39:17.890 --> 39:20.460
That is true. Yeah.

39:22.790 --> 39:24.560
Dad?

39:24.590 --> 39:25.730
Yeah.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.900
The offer's from me.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.740
You're serious?

39:32.770 --> 39:34.270
I asked the real estate lady

39:34.300 --> 39:35.870
to let me be the one
to tell you.

39:35.910 --> 39:39.480
( snorts )

39:39.510 --> 39:42.810
Charlie, this is crazy.

39:42.850 --> 39:45.320
What's crazy?
It's a good investment.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.950
How else would you want me
to spend my money?

39:47.980 --> 39:51.920
Yeah, I know, but I just figured
you'd, uh,

39:51.960 --> 39:53.760
get a place of your own.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.790
This is a place of my own.

39:55.830 --> 39:58.530
And you can stay here, too...

39:58.560 --> 39:59.600
if you want.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.970
Just like you
said, you know,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.430
I never paid any rent, so you
wouldn't have to either.

40:04.470 --> 40:07.240
Yeah, all right, all right,
Charlie, you know, I get it.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.680
I just don't think you realize

40:12.710 --> 40:14.780
what you're getting
yourself into.

40:14.810 --> 40:17.850
How's that? I've lived here
pretty much my whole life.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.950
I think I'm used to it by now.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.890
( clanking )

40:22.920 --> 40:23.990
Uh, that'll be
the furnace

40:24.020 --> 40:25.990
in your newly-acquired home.

40:26.020 --> 40:27.860
There's a wrench
in the basement.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.790
I'm sure you can figure it out.
