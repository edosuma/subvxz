Hey.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.479
Anyone catch the sunrise this morning? Ah.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.274
It just keeps getting later and later
every day.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.610
-I got you a coffee, K-dog.
-Permission to reject nickname?

00:27.694 --> 00:30.697
Permission granted, Kavarooney.
Ooh, there it is.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.490
-Found it.
-[Kaavi] You found nothing.

00:32.574 --> 00:33.867
[Annie] Well, well, well.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.704
Did someone heed my advice
and clamp her puss around a good attitude?

00:37.787 --> 00:40.582
Hey, why shouldn't I have a good attitude?

00:40.665 --> 00:44.335
The launch is in ten days.
We've already found our hundred pieces.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.588
Kavarooney's finishing up the site.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.505
[Kaavi] Please stop.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.508
And you are going to be throwing us
a sweet-ass party.

00:50.592 --> 00:54.596
Uh, yeah, I am.
My entire day is devoted to the playlists.

00:54.679 --> 00:59.684
I need a pregame, a throw-down,
a postgame, a chill mix, a step up--

00:59.768 --> 01:02.604
Don't forget "It's 3 a.m.,
get out and throw your cups away,

01:02.687 --> 01:03.730
I ain't your mama" mix.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.398
Why not just turn the music off?

01:05.482 --> 01:07.901
Because that would be party suicide,
Kavarooney.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.652
Oh, yeah. That name's gonna stick.

I don't want to break up with him.

Yes, I would like catering
for 20 to 200 people,

06:00.401 --> 06:01.736
and we don't have much money.

any inexpensive options?

as a gift to Sophia.

for the party tomorrow.

The big launch.

Sophia, this is the night
we're gonna look back on when we're old.

11:44.120 --> 11:44.954
Yeah?

11:45.037 --> 11:47.915
And our boobs
are in totally different places.

So much ahead of us.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.430
Okay, stop talking about the moment.
Talking about the moment ruins the moment.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.850
Oh, okay, but on my deathbed,
I'm only going to think of two things.

Oh?

This night...

12:09.311 --> 12:11.272
and when Kelly Clarkson won <i>American Idol.</i>

12:12.731 --> 12:14.567
I fucked a firefighter that night.

-Just click there.
-I can't believe it. This moment is here.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.375
Everything that we've worked toward.
It all comes down

Yes, well, I thought it would take me
years to discover my new passion,

and a trip to Party City.
