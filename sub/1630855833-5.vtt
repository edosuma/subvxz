Yeah, we went to the same
school in third grade.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.182
Everyone called him
pee streak zeke.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.850
What? Why'd they call him that?

01:41.977 --> 01:43.644
Longest pee?
Duration or distance?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.062
Or a fun combination of the two?

01:45.106 --> 01:46.897
-Not exactly.
-Okay, well,

Ha!

02:12.508 --> 02:14.550
Okay, thanks for coming over

02:14.635 --> 02:17.219
Kinda slow at my place lately.
You been slow, too?

02:17.263 --> 02:19.296
Uh, yeah.
Do you need something?

02:19.390 --> 02:20.722
-You know, you get one rat...
-Yeah,

02:20.808 --> 02:22.266
-Well, that's
part of the business.
-...Pack.

02:22.393 --> 02:23.851
One pack of rats,
covered in roaches,

02:23.936 --> 02:25.394
And suddenly people don't
want to eat their spaghetti.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.771
You had a pack of rats
covered with roaches?

02:27.857 --> 02:29.189
Yeah.
What, you never had that?

02:29.275 --> 02:30.691
Uh, not-not at the same time.

"the burger ball pit?"

02:35.698 --> 02:37.573
[bob] oh, it's just
something I was trying.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.617
I-it's a bunch of tiny meatballs
instead of a patty.

02:40.703 --> 02:41.493
Tiny meatballs?

02:41.579 --> 02:42.911
Yeah, I was just fooling around.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.288
Cheese holds 'em all in place.

-Hmm.
-Yeah? I mean--

-Okay, goodbye.
-Oh. Okay.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.500
-Bye.
-You're a fart.

02:48.544 --> 02:51.128
Right. That was almost
a normal conversation.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.213
But you're you,
so y-you said that.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.340
[makes fart noises]
that's you.

02:55.426 --> 02:58.468
Am I crazy or would this
make a nice apartment?

02:58.554 --> 03:00.596
Get some houseplants,
maybe a mini fridge.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.182
It's basically an upgrade
from where we live now.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.184
So, I had some more ideas
about tank bottoms.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.518
-Uh-huh.
-"tank bottoms"

03:06.604 --> 03:08.187
Is kind of a mouthful,
so I was thinking

03:08.272 --> 03:10.939
-We would call them tb's.
-Oh, uh, y-yeah, yeah.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.232
But then the problem is

03:12.318 --> 03:13.901
That's also what
they call tuberculosis.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.194
Mm-hmm, sounds great.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.695
Zeke, are you even
listening to me?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.030
-Yeah. Sorry.
-What are you

03:18.115 --> 03:19.531
-Looking at?
-Nothin', nothin'.

03:19.617 --> 03:20.574
What, tetherball?

03:20.743 --> 03:22.242
Oh, my god.
Another tb.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.952
So, yeah,
this is our tetherball.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.412
It can be sneaky,

03:25.497 --> 03:26.872
-So if you play it, be careful.
-Uh-huh.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.458
You want to
give this baby a spin?

03:29.543 --> 03:30.375
Oh, you missed it.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.501
Ow. I'm okay.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.337
-Sorry. I'll be right back.
-Oh. Okay.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.713
What do you think about
this for a slogan?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.215
"the tb you want to get."

03:36.300 --> 03:38.842
Oh, oh, I love it, uh...
But, uh, listen. I got to go.

The pizza ball pit?

Smart, right?
I just tore up a pizza,

04:30.229 --> 04:32.187
Smashed it into balls
and put it on top

04:32.273 --> 04:33.981
Of another pizza.
Like a ball pit.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.050
Something really heroic, yeah.
Why?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.427
I feel bad for zeke, too,

07:08.554 --> 07:11.388
But I just don't think
aggression is the answer.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.848
Um, it definitely is.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.058
If you bully a bully,
it's still bullying.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.102
I'm not in the mood for riddles.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.437
Ooh, those look interesting.

07:18.522 --> 07:19.938
What are they--
edible pillows full of cheese?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.523
Uh-huh.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.775
Did you get your bun tightened?
It looks gorgeous.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.570
-I did. Thank you.
-Thank you.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.238
How's your regular cheeseburger

07:28.323 --> 07:30.073
That you can literally
get any day, teddy?

07:30.159 --> 07:31.450
Really good, bob. Mmm.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.536
Can't believe pesto just
stole my burger ball pit idea.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.372
You know, people sometimes have
the same idea at the same time.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.249
Remember when
<i> deep impact</i> and<i> armageddon</i>

07:39.334 --> 07:40.750
Came out in the same year?

07:40.836 --> 07:42.419
Or when steve harvey
started going bald

07:42.504 --> 07:44.671
-Right when I
started going bald?
-Spooky.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.548
It's not like that.
At all.

07:46.717 --> 07:49.176
I had the idea first,
he saw it and then he stole it--

07:49.261 --> 07:51.261
Oh, my god.
I think he's getting a line.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.471
What? No.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.222
They could be there
for another reason,

07:54.308 --> 07:57.559
All a few feet apart
and facing the same direction

07:57.644 --> 07:59.186
And waiting to get inside.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.229
Did you see
what they're doing at pesto's?

08:01.356 --> 08:03.106
Pizza balls.
Such a fun idea.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.900
-[bob] it was my idea!
-Whoa.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.359
Order the burger
of the day, mort.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.195
Do not make
the same mistake I did.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.156
Uh, one burger
of the day, please?

08:11.241 --> 08:13.909
Oh, look at that.
Burger balls. Fun.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.285
Don't patronize me, mort!

08:15.370 --> 08:17.871
Jeez, you really
screwed that one up, mort.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.372
Hey guys.
We got to stop

08:19.500 --> 08:21.291
Meeting like this.
Just kidding.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.168
No, not on that side, rudy.
Uh, sit-sit over here.

08:23.295 --> 08:24.419
What? Why?

08:24.546 --> 08:26.588
The, um, the lighting
is all weird over there.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.507
-Okay.
-Zeke, you're here.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.966
What happened to the library?

08:30.093 --> 08:31.384
Was it too noisy?

08:31.470 --> 08:32.469
Oh, mr. Frond saw me

08:32.596 --> 08:34.012
And said I needed
to get some nutrition.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.764
I told him I was
reading a cookbook

08:35.849 --> 08:37.641
So that should count, but
he didn't agree. And I wasn't

08:37.768 --> 08:39.893
Reading a cookbook, I was just
holding my hands like this.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.269
Zeke, I just want you to know

08:41.396 --> 08:43.271
That I'm here for you
and I care about you.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.606
Do you want some of my ravioli?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.149
-Yes.
-I was talking to zeke.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.026
And don't worry, zeke.
We got you covered.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.236
Thanks. But what?

08:49.363 --> 08:51.029
We're gonna shut
will the bully down.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.447
Willy bully.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.573
W-what? Do what?

08:53.700 --> 08:54.908
You don't have to hide it, zeke.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.660
We figured it out.
We know you were bullied.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.411
-Zeke was bullied?
-Wait, wait, wait.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.288
And I get why
you wouldn't want to tell me,

09:00.374 --> 09:02.624
Because I'm one of the cool kids
and you were embarrassed.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.584
-No, you don't understand.
I was--
-[louise] listen,

09:04.711 --> 09:07.087
As soon as tina and will sit
down, I'm gonna distract will,

09:07.214 --> 09:08.713
Gene's gonna spray will's crotch
with apple juice

09:08.799 --> 09:10.924
-Under the table...
-My apple juice.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.385
Some of us are
making a big sacrifice today.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.053
No. No, guys, no.
Please don't do that.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.680
Shush, shush, shush!
Here he comes.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.181
Tina! Will!
Over here.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.558
Hey, everybody.
We were just doing

09:19.676 --> 09:21.142
The whole lunch line thing.
It went pretty well.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.686
They had lunch at
his old school, too.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.104
Tina, sit right across from me.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.313
O-okay.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.773
Hey there, will. [chuckles]
so, you're--

09:26.858 --> 09:28.733
So, you're sitting here.
That's cool.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.236
[chuckles] great.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.904
So, will, what do you think
of wagstaff so far?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.031
And maintain eye contact
with me while you answer

09:35.117 --> 09:36.408
And don't look anywhere else.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.617
Um, seems okay.

09:37.703 --> 09:38.952
-Will, uh...
-What?

09:39.037 --> 09:40.996
Interesting ravioli.
Interesting ravioli!

09:41.123 --> 09:42.414
-Gene, no!
-What are you doing?

09:42.499 --> 09:44.291
[zeke]
where is it?
Give it to me! Come on!

09:44.376 --> 09:46.126
-[gene] stop it,
you're gonna ruin it!
-Gimee-- come on, stop it.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.377
What's going on under there?

09:47.462 --> 09:48.420
Let go!

09:48.547 --> 09:49.838
So, uh, will, uh,
what'd you think of

09:49.965 --> 09:52.457
The booger wall?
Boogerific, am I right?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.342
-What?
-Aah!

09:54.428 --> 09:56.803
-Dang it, gene!
-You got zeke's crotch!

09:56.888 --> 09:57.846
Bad news: Yes.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.264
Good news:
Still some juice left.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.641
Don't you say it, will.
Don't you say it.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.351
-Say what?
-Pee streak zeke.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.186
-Sorry, zeke.
-H-hold on, now.

10:05.314 --> 10:08.315
I wasn't gonna say-- wait, were
you gonna squirt that on me?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.774
Yes, we were gonna bully you

10:09.860 --> 10:11.318
Before you could
bully anyone else.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.902
So, did it work?
Are we heroes?

10:13.030 --> 10:14.195
Let's say yes.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.697
-People, please.
-Why don't you just pick on

10:15.824 --> 10:18.116
Someone your own size,
tall guy, like

10:18.201 --> 10:19.909
-Mr. Branca.
-I don't want any trouble!

10:19.995 --> 10:21.328
Everybody, just stop.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.371
-Will never
bullied me or anyone.
-What?

10:23.498 --> 10:24.831
Come again?

10:24.958 --> 10:25.999
I was...

10:26.084 --> 10:27.375
I was the bully.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.376
[all gasp]

10:28.503 --> 10:31.296
And that was
the last of my juice.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.967
So, you're not a bully?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.969
-No.
-But you're so tall.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.179
You do kind of have this whole

10:39.306 --> 10:40.597
"don't mess with me" vibe

10:40.724 --> 10:42.432
That has a lot of the girls
around here going crazy.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.225
Other girls.
Not me, but I get it.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.227
-I can see that.
-Like zeke said,

10:46.313 --> 10:48.897
He was the bully.
I was the bullied.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.231
[sighs] I-I'm gonna go

10:50.317 --> 10:51.483
Try to dry off.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.234
Sorry, me spraying juice
on you wasn't bullying,

10:53.320 --> 10:54.611
That was just an accident.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.071
Zeke, what did--
what happened?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.489
[sighs]
I'm not proud of it,

10:57.699 --> 10:59.449
But by the time
I started going to school

10:59.576 --> 11:02.327
At rocky creek elementary,
where will went,

11:02.454 --> 11:04.245
<i> I had already</i>
<i> been to so many schools,</i>

11:04.331 --> 11:05.955
<i> 'cause my family</i>
<i> moved around so much.</i>

11:06.041 --> 11:08.625
<i> I was always the new kid, and</i>
<i> it wasn't easy making friends.</i>

11:08.710 --> 11:11.503
<i> Between that and my</i>
<i> impulse control issues, I just</i>

11:11.588 --> 11:14.080
<i> Started wrestling kids.</i>
<i> Like, all the time.</i>

11:14.174 --> 11:15.674
<i> Before I even knew</i>
<i> it was a sport.</i>

11:15.801 --> 11:18.510
<i>I couldn't help it, I just-just</i>
<i> had a lot of nervous energy.</i>

11:18.595 --> 11:20.095
<i> Then one day I got</i>
<i> a kid in a headlock,</i>

11:20.263 --> 11:22.305
<i> And I guess I caught him</i>
<i> on his way to the bathroom,</i>

11:22.391 --> 11:23.973
<i> And also maybe he was scared</i>

11:24.101 --> 11:25.600
<i> 'cause of me</i>
<i> putting him in a headlock,</i>

11:25.727 --> 11:27.727
<i> And he... [sighs]</i>
<i> ...Well, he peed a little,</i>

11:27.813 --> 11:29.020
<i> And everyone pointed</i>
<i> and laughed,</i>

11:29.106 --> 11:30.730
<i> And that's how it all started.</i>

11:30.857 --> 11:32.482
<i> After that first kid peed, the</i>
<i> kids who thought it was funny</i>

11:32.609 --> 11:34.484
<i> Were like,</i>
<i> "come hang out with us."</i>

11:34.611 --> 11:36.444
<i> And-and then I kept trying</i>
<i> to make 'em laugh.</i>

11:36.530 --> 11:38.863
<i> And even though I only made</i>
<i> that first kid pee,</i>

11:38.949 --> 11:40.407
<i> They-they called me</i>
<i> pee streak zeke.</i>

11:40.492 --> 11:43.159
<i> And, yeah, will was, uh,</i>
<i> one of the kids I bullied.</i>

11:43.286 --> 11:45.912
Pee streak zeke!
Pee streak zeke!

11:45.997 --> 11:47.997
<i> I mean, I had</i>
<i> a group of friends,</i>

11:48.083 --> 11:50.500
<i> A nickname, and it was</i>
<i> the first time I felt like...</i>

11:50.627 --> 11:51.960
Like I-I belonged.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.754
-Wow.
-I know. It's a lot.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.089
That's pretty bad, zeke.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.133
I've been told I have
the perfect neck for headlocks,

11:58.260 --> 12:00.176
But, uh, I'm trying to cut down.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.345
I know, it's awful.
I don't like to talk about it.

12:02.431 --> 12:03.930
I don't even like
to think about it.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.348
I'm not that person anymore.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.517
But zeke, now you have
the chance to apologize,

12:07.644 --> 12:10.228
Make amends,
right the wrongs of the past.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.896
You should definitely apologize.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.065
Maybe send him, like,
an edible arrangement

12:14.151 --> 12:15.316
Or give him your house?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.901
Maybe adopt a highway for him?

12:16.987 --> 12:19.320
Oh, um, will?
Will doesn't seem like he's...

12:19.448 --> 12:21.865
He's ready to hear an apology
or talk to me at all.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.366
I think the best thing
for me to do

12:23.535 --> 12:25.660
Is just to keep
a respectful distance.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.203
No, zeke.
Just do it now.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.997
It's the only way
to move forward.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.457
But-- [chuckles]
I, uh--

12:30.542 --> 12:31.908
-[school bell rings]
-oops, that's the bell.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.168
Guess we'll put a pin in this
for now

12:33.336 --> 12:34.461
And just focus on our studies.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.296
Wait.
Will, can you please meet us

12:36.423 --> 12:37.589
On the steps out front
after school?

12:37.632 --> 12:39.549
Zeke has something
he wants to tell you.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.718
Or if you're busy,
that's totally cool.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.927
Late notice, I-I get it.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.804
You, uh, probably have plans.
[weak chuckle]

12:44.931 --> 12:46.890
No, I'll be there.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.349
-Great.
-Mm, great.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.810
Uh, come on, will, I'll take you
to your next class.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.187
I think
we have algebra together.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.980
"alge-bring" you there.
[chuckles]

12:54.107 --> 12:56.357
Trust me, zeke.
This is gonna be a good thing.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.692
Oh... Oh, boy.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.903
I guess I'll have to take
the rest of these to go.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.071
And there we go.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.823
Like a little italian squirrel.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.950
-Oh, yeah.
<i> -Grazie.</i>

13:06.036 --> 13:07.577
[grumbling]

13:07.662 --> 13:10.371
So, bob, are you just
gonna keep stewing or what?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.040
[gasps] someone's taking
pictures of pesto's

13:12.125 --> 13:13.458
With a fancy camera.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.834
D-do you think
they're from the paper?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.994
Oh, my god, that's it.
I'm going over there.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.213
Oh, no, bob, don't.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.923
Linda's right, bob.
To what end?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.090
"to what end?"

13:21.259 --> 13:22.592
-Just say "why," mort.
-Why?

13:22.677 --> 13:24.427
-Are you asking that
to me or to bob?
-I don't know.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.553
I'm going to expose him.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.222
I'm gonna tell
that reporter person--

13:27.349 --> 13:29.516
If it is a reporter person--
that it was my idea.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.101
Come on, bob,
we know you had the idea,

13:32.229 --> 13:33.344
You know you had the idea,

13:33.438 --> 13:34.938
And you'll have another
idea tomorrow.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.023
If you don't have a heart attack
over jimmy pesto.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.192
Linda's right, bob.
And my therapist would say

13:39.277 --> 13:40.902
That you should focus
on your own happiness

13:40.987 --> 13:42.195
And not compare it
to other people's.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.530
Your therapist is an idiot!

13:43.657 --> 13:44.781
You take that back, bob!

13:44.866 --> 13:46.741
Do not speak
of dr. Marjorie that way.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.369
That woman has put up
with so much in her life.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.038
-What?
-The balls haven't
always rolled her way!

13:52.123 --> 13:54.165
Okay, I'm sorry.
She's probably great.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.543
She's just never met
jimmy pesto.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.794
Aw, bob.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.212
So many little balls.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.547
I really just wanted soup.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.465
I know, mort.
I know.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.425
[jimmy]
so, I just thought to myself,

14:04.469 --> 14:07.470
"balls. Pizza balls." and then,
"pizza ball pit." boom.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.056
-Oh, my god.
-Bob, we're gonna
be in the paper

14:10.225 --> 14:11.766
On the internet,
where it really counts.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.476
My mom's finally
gonna be proud of me.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.352
That's great, trev.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.104
Uh, I have something interesting

14:16.231 --> 14:17.897
-For the article.
-Sorry, who are you?

14:17.983 --> 14:19.649
I am the guy who invented--

<i> dah-dah-dah-bah-bah</i> ♪

14:21.027 --> 14:22.652
-I invented--

14:22.737 --> 14:24.279
-I happen to have invented--
-♪<i> dah-bup-bup</i> ♪

14:24.364 --> 14:26.114
Uh, look, I don't know
what this is,

14:26.199 --> 14:27.532
But I'm on a deadline, okay?

14:27.659 --> 14:29.033
You should be interviewing me.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.743
Hmm, who should I interview,

14:30.871 --> 14:32.161
The inventor of
the pizza ball pit

14:32.330 --> 14:34.205
Or some guy who wandered in
off the street

14:34.332 --> 14:36.082
Who won't stop shrieking
while I'm trying to work?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.292
I'm not shrieking!

14:37.377 --> 14:38.501
Let's go someplace quieter.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.420
Come back in the kitchen.
I-I can show you

14:40.505 --> 14:43.464
The oven where it all happens.
It looks like a microwave,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.300
But it's not
exactly a microwave.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.551
[groans]

14:46.636 --> 14:48.344
-Hmm.
-So, you're staying?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.846
Yes. I'm gonna
make sure that that guy

14:49.973 --> 14:52.515
Tells the world
that jimmy is a total fraud.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.101
All right. Want some water
while you're waiting?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.311
No, I don't want water.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.813
Actually, yes.
I-I'm a little thirsty.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.939
[sighs] thank you.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.107
-Seven dollars.
-What?

15:01.192 --> 15:02.775
Got you.
Classic me.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.320
-[school bell rings]
-well, I don't see will
anywhere, j-ju.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.906
I guess I'll head home,
try again tomorrow.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.616
Zeke, wait.
I know what you're doing.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.868
You're trying to kick this can
down the road.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.662
Well, guess what?
That road is a dead end.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.289
-I know, but--
-zeke, listen.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.124
We've all done things
we're not proud of.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.417
I used to tell andy and ollie

15:19.502 --> 15:20.710
That there was actually
only one of them.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.920
It messed with them for weeks.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.171
-Jeez.
-The point is

15:23.256 --> 15:24.589
We recognize our mistakes

15:24.674 --> 15:26.466
And we learn from them.
It's how we grow.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.593
Did we miss it?
Did anyone dvr it?

15:28.720 --> 15:31.429
Not yet. And for all we know,
will already went home and--

15:31.514 --> 15:32.639
-Here he comes.
-Dang.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.140
And this is what we do
when the bell rings

15:34.267 --> 15:35.934
At the end of the day.
We come outside.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.436
And that completes
your welcome tour of wagstaff.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.397
Hey, will. Zeke wants
to tell you something.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.607
-Zeke?
-Uh...

15:42.734 --> 15:44.192
I'm-I'm sorry I bullied you.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.569
-Okay?
-I'm sorry I did all those
awful things to you

15:46.655 --> 15:49.197
To impress people, putting you
in headlocks and stuff,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.657
But... I'm not that kid anymore.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.075
So, I hope you can forgive me

15:52.160 --> 15:54.285
And we can be okay
with each other moving forward.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.496
Wow, will, pretty
heartfelt apology

15:56.623 --> 15:59.248
From zeke over here.
What you thinking?

15:59.417 --> 16:00.959
I do not accept.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.377
What? What the hell, will?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.712
He didn't even apologize
for what he actually did.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.005
Oh, but-- uh...

16:06.132 --> 16:07.215
What, making you pee your pants?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.383
He never made me pee.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.134
He got me
in a headlock a few times,

16:10.261 --> 16:11.803
But that's not
the really bad part.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.346
What's the really bad part?

16:13.431 --> 16:14.722
Hey, jimmy junior,
don't you have to go?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.724
You have that thing, right?
You better get going.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.810
G-get on, now.
Get out. Get.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.144
He made fun of my lisp.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.771
-[gasps]
-whoa.
-[gasp]

16:21.898 --> 16:23.314
Your lips?
They look fine to me.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.983
They look completely normal.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.985
Not my lips.
My lisp.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.987
What? Seriously?!

16:32.367 --> 16:34.575
I can't believe you made fun
of someone's lisp, zeke.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.494
-That's so messed-up.
-It was just one time

16:36.579 --> 16:38.913
And I felt so bad
I-I never did it again.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.081
Wait, you have a lisp?

16:40.250 --> 16:41.916
I did, when I was
in third grade.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.794
<i> I said "stop, zeke.</i>
<i> You're so stupid."</i>

16:44.879 --> 16:47.088
<i> But I had a lisp,</i>
<i> so it came out...</i>

16:47.173 --> 16:48.840
Thtop, theke.
You're tho thtupid.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.550
<i> And zeke made fun of me.</i>

16:50.635 --> 16:52.301
<i> I didn't want all those</i>
<i> guys to see me cry</i>

16:52.387 --> 16:54.220
<i> So I hid in a bathroom stall</i>

16:54.264 --> 16:55.930
<i> -For the rest of recess.</i>
-[tina]<i> oh, will.</i>

16:56.016 --> 16:57.473
<i> And then some kids came in</i>

16:57.559 --> 16:59.308
<i> And they saw</i>
<i> the closed stall door</i>

16:59.394 --> 17:01.102
<i> And they said "ew, someone's</i>
<i> pooping in there."</i>

17:01.187 --> 17:02.603
<i> And I said "no, I'm not."</i>

17:02.689 --> 17:04.772
<i> But I sounded like</i>
<i> I was crying when I said it,</i>

17:04.858 --> 17:06.482
<i> And crying in the bathroom</i>
<i> seemed worse,</i>

17:06.568 --> 17:08.359
<i> So I leaned into</i>
<i> the pooping thing</i>

17:08.445 --> 17:10.069
<i>And I said "I mean, yes, I am,"</i>

17:10.196 --> 17:12.655
<i> And I made some fart noises</i>
<i> and tried to make</i>

17:12.782 --> 17:14.782
-The whole thing believable.
-[gene] good for you.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.118
I'm sorry, will.
And jimmy jr, please.

17:17.245 --> 17:20.038
You're my best friend.
You got to know how sorry I am.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.664
I don't know what to say, zeke.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.917
I don't even think I want to do
tank bottoms with you anymore.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.252
Don't say that, j-ju.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.337
I mean, yeah,
a lot of people don't know this,

17:28.381 --> 17:30.214
But I have a speech impediment.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.799
-Huh.
-Really?
-Wha? I never, um...

17:31.968 --> 17:33.509
Yeah. I worked through
a lot of it,

17:33.636 --> 17:35.344
But sometimes it still shows up.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.429
You have to believe me.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.222
I never did anything
like that again.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.640
I mean, I did
some wrestling stuff,

17:39.726 --> 17:42.101
But never the speech stuff
or someone's looks

17:42.145 --> 17:44.145
Or height or weight
or anything.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.730
You have to forgive me, guys.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.356
There's got to be
something I can do.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.400
I honestly don't see
how you fix this, zeke.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.152
Money never hurts.
Hundred bucks each?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.904
50 to me for brokering the deal?

17:52.947 --> 17:54.822
Show 'em your butt,
let them make fun of it?

17:54.866 --> 17:55.990
-Fine.
-Oh, wow.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.408
Zeke, don't.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.744
I mean, you could,
um, lick the booger wall.

17:59.829 --> 18:00.661
-What?
-Yes.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.871
Interesting.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.790
I guess it would show
you're really sorry.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.124
Okay. [sighs]

18:05.251 --> 18:06.459
Looks like I'm gonna
lick a booger wall.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.212
Wow, I'm not usually into
after-school activities

18:09.297 --> 18:10.838
But I'll stick around
for this one.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.131
[sighs]

18:12.967 --> 18:16.552
Ugh.
How is his water not even good?

18:20.350 --> 18:23.017
Come on, bob,
we know you had the idea,

18:23.061 --> 18:24.268
You know you had the idea,

18:24.354 --> 18:26.145
And you'll have
another idea tomorrow.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.438
You should focus
on your own happiness

18:27.524 --> 18:28.815
And not compare it
to other people.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.483
Linda's right, bob.
To what end?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.610
"to what end?"
just say "why," mort.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.278
Thanks again.
Our readers are gonna love this.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.114
Oh, good, that guy's still here.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.782
I'm just gonna keep talking
as I exit

18:37.867 --> 18:39.700
-So he can't talk to me.
See you later. Bye.
-[jimmy] bob?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.202
What are you still doing here?

18:41.287 --> 18:42.870
Looking for some good food?
That's a zoom.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.455
Well, I came over here
to tell everyone

18:44.582 --> 18:46.624
That you're a liar
who stole my idea.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.459
Ha! You are... That.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.087
But now all I want to do
is tell you something.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.547
What's that, bob?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.090
I'd rather be me than you.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.800
[scoffs]
yeah, right. You'd rather

18:55.927 --> 18:58.177
Be scraping by
than have a popular place

18:58.221 --> 19:00.263
And a mostly-restored 280z?
Come on.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.557
I can always
think of other ideas, jimmy.

19:02.717 --> 19:04.100
This wasn't even one of my best.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.393
It might be one of my worst.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.520
And since you and
your customers like it,

19:07.647 --> 19:08.646
That's a red flag.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.356
-Ouch.
-So this idea--

19:10.441 --> 19:12.108
You can have it.
I don't need it.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.026
All I need is right up here.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.444
-Whoa.
-Don't "whoa."

19:15.572 --> 19:17.655
Sorry.
I want that kind of confidence.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.073
Aw, j-just--
zip it.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.908
Okay, zipping.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.034
Unzipping.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.452
[teddy]
you're back. Finally.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.079
What happened--
did you make a big stink?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.832
Did you steal the reporter's pen
and scribble all over his notes?

19:27.917 --> 19:30.751
No, I just told jimmy
I'd rather be me than him.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.212
Aw, bobby.
So wise.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.589
Like a little bobby buddha.
Mwah.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.884
And I said that I'll have
another, better idea tomorrow.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.093
Yeah, that's what I told you.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.511
I guess I stole it from you.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.388
Well, I won't make
a big deal about it,

19:42.473 --> 19:45.057
Like some handsome
cutie-pie chefs.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.392
She's talking about you, bob.

19:46.477 --> 19:47.518
Thanks, teddy.

19:47.645 --> 19:48.978
[louise]
so many boogers.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.354
[gene]
precious memories.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.773
It's more booger than wall
at this point.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.568
Okay. Here goes.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.875
Wait, zeke.
You don't have to do this.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.669
You were willing to
lick boogers. That's enough.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.046
I mean, I guess.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.505
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.966
I was asking jimmy jr.
I mean, you too, but also him.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.676
Yeah, will's right.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.888
I didn't know you then
but I know you now, zeke.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.223
I know your heart.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.308
Oh man, j-ju.
[groans]

20:27.477 --> 20:29.685
-What are you doing?
-Stop! You don't have to do it.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.104
That's what's gonna make it
even more beautiful. [grunting]

-Yes!

it wasn't that bad.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.612

look at you right now.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.207

-Come on, who wants it?
-[all shouting]

I'm gonna get you
