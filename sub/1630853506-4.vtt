WEBVTT

00:09.520 --> 00:11.680
Oh, my God. What happened?

00:11.680 --> 00:13.680
A little warning from The Dean.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.320
How's it coming with the money?
We've only got two weeks left.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.920
Yep, we're on target,

00:18.920 --> 00:22.400
it's the final push
but, um...

00:22.400 --> 00:24.160
..we're low on stock.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.560
Of what?

00:25.560 --> 00:28.000
Everything.
Even crack?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.400
It's our bestseller.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.560
Professionals, clubbers,
students, they love it.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.520
Yeah. It can get you like that.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.120
OK, so how do we replenish stock?

00:37.120 --> 00:40.440
You need some fresh ingredients
and a cook.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.280
I'll arrange it. Well done.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.720
I'm impressed.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.160
The Brook Hill crew is
nominally run

00:48.160 --> 00:49.480
by this man,

00:49.480 --> 00:52.080
Christian Taylor.
Taylor's currently inside

00:52.080 --> 00:54.080
for violating the terms
of his probation.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.400
So who's in charge now?
His lieutenants?

00:56.400 --> 00:58.000
Unclear. Souljah's gone to ground,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.200
and Spider was shot and injured by
persons unknown.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.960
Have you spoken to him? We have.
He's still so weak he could barely

01:02.960 --> 01:05.200
answer our questions let alone run
any kind of crew.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.880
Do we know how Brook Hill is
structured?

01:06.880 --> 01:08.760
Like most local crews,
we think they've got

01:08.760 --> 01:11.760
a network of foot soldiers who are
young and highly mobile.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.880
I thought I might go
and see Mum later.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.240
Oh. Well, say hi from me.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.920
You could come, she'd like that.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.840
Normally I'd be in like Flynn,
but sadly, I got a thing.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.400
Do you not feel like
you owe Mum a visit?

01:31.400 --> 01:34.520
Absolutely. It's on my list.
Right at the top.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.840
Brook Hill is plugged into
the local community.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.840
Though we believe they have ties to
this major London player, The Dean.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.920
Well, that means Brook Hill has
to get profits back

01:46.920 --> 01:48.720
to London, which means a bagman.
Any leads?

01:48.720 --> 01:51.200
Not yet, but The Dean's been at the
top level for years,

01:51.200 --> 01:53.840
so anyone moving money
for him will be one slick operator.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.840
I don't like broccoli.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.920
You can't live entirely off
Tangy Cheese Doritos.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.360
You need fruit and veg in your diet
if you want to love again.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.280
Why? All right, supposing you go
round to Anne-Marie's house

02:04.280 --> 02:05.840
and she's made you a nice salad.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.000
I'll just pretend to have a stroke.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.960
How about...an olive?

02:09.960 --> 02:11.600
Oh, fuck off!

02:11.600 --> 02:14.320
We've identified a kid -
Carter, 17 -

02:14.320 --> 02:16.160
we know he's running
for Brook Hill.

02:16.160 --> 02:19.000
We need four plainclothes in one
week to run surveillance on him.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.360
No. I don't have the manpower.
Sir, if we sit on this kid

02:21.360 --> 02:24.240
for long enough, whoever's running
Brook Hill will show their face.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.200
Two people, 48 hours.
Three people, 72 hours.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.760
Fine. But I want pictures
on my desk in three days.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.720
You better watch yourself.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.240
The Feds was here asking about
The Dean.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.960
They know someone's running my end,
so look sharp.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.640
You got to leave right now?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.800
Yeah. What?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.360
If you go,

02:48.360 --> 02:50.720
I got to go back to my cell
and talk to Hank,

02:50.720 --> 02:53.440
and he ain't exactly
Graham Norton, you know?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.760
Can...can we just talk?

02:58.800 --> 03:01.640
What do you want to...talk about?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.920
Anything.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.680
Why did you become a drug dealer?

03:05.680 --> 03:07.280
The pension plan.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.480
Aren't you scared of getting hurt?

03:09.480 --> 03:12.600
My dad never broke the law once.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.920
He was a welder all his life.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.840
What did he get
for all his honest hard work?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.360
Chronic lung disease from
the fumes.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.560
Why didn't you stay in school,
get an education?

03:23.560 --> 03:26.240
If your family couldn't afford
to put food on the table

03:26.240 --> 03:28.520
and someone offered you
a chance to make money,

03:28.520 --> 03:31.920
what would you choose?
Dealing, or double maths?

04:09.080 --> 04:12.480
Following an extensive
community needs assessment,

04:12.480 --> 04:14.400
we have a strategy that's in
line with

04:14.400 --> 04:16.480
the city's economic action
plan. Slide.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.480
When I say, "Slide," Susie,
jump to the next slide.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.080
What are you doing?

04:21.080 --> 04:22.640
Prepping for the Town Hall tonight.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.040
You can stand down, love,
I'll be doing the talking.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.720
You don't know how
to work PowerPoint.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.040
We don't need slides,
we need passion.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.520
This isn't rabble-rousing.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.760
We need to convince
the council that we have

04:32.760 --> 04:35.080
the financial nous to take over
the community centre.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
You have never
done a Town Hall, love.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.480
You've got to win the crowd.
It is war.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.360
Maybe we should put it to
the group.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.560
Claire,

04:42.560 --> 04:45.000
although I fully support
the democratic process,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.960
in this instance, kindly do one.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.000
I will be speaking at the meeting.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.760
Oh, my God. Lara's back on Her.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.080
Am I supposed
to know what that means?

04:56.080 --> 04:58.160
Er, OK. Um, Lara,

04:58.160 --> 04:59.760
Lara is my ex,

04:59.760 --> 05:01.560
and Her is-is-is
a lesbian dating site,

05:01.560 --> 05:04.240
which means that she's single again.
I don't know what to do. I mean,

05:04.240 --> 05:06.880
should I DM her? I should probably
DM her, right? I mean, is it weird

05:06.880 --> 05:09.320
if I DM her? I don't know, I mean,
I think it would be weirder if

05:09.320 --> 05:11.840
I didn't DM her, is that right? What
do I do, Greg? Have you thought

05:11.840 --> 05:14.760
about DM'ing her? You really think I
should? I mean, last time I saw her,

05:14.760 --> 05:18.120
I royally shat the nest. Well,
you're in a better place now. Yeah.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.840
Emotionally, not physically.
I mean, your place was way nicer.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.560
Yeah. Are you on the apps?

05:22.560 --> 05:25.400
Oof! No. Need a full body or brain
transplant before

05:25.400 --> 05:27.560
an internet lady found
me attractive.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.560
That's nonsense. You should, you
should definitely be on the apps.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.120
Really? You think so?

05:32.120 --> 05:35.000
Yeah... Yeah, you should.
I mean, look, we...

05:35.000 --> 05:37.240
..we need to work on
a few things first, but...

05:37.240 --> 05:38.600
Like what?

05:38.600 --> 05:41.200
Well, your diet,
posture, conversation,

05:41.200 --> 05:43.920
wardrobe, general aura and height.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.040
My height?
Yeah. You're just...

05:46.040 --> 05:48.760
You're too tall.
You loom over people and it's...

05:48.760 --> 05:50.440
How can I change that?

05:50.440 --> 05:53.120
You could be in the distance more.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.400
Sure, I'll try that. OK.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.000
Hmm. I'm going to make you my
new project.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.800
Greg 2.0.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.800
I'm going to sign you up to all of
the dating apps, so...

06:03.800 --> 06:05.280
..commit to change,

06:05.280 --> 06:07.960
choose happiness,
and eat the broccolini.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.720
Careful, it's hot. OK.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.440
Mmm. That's amazing.

06:16.440 --> 06:22.320
Yeah? Mmm, thank you. Um,
I spoke to my parents.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.080
OK. You ask about the loan?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.760
No.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.240
No?

06:28.240 --> 06:30.720
It's just a bit difficult
cos, you know,

06:30.720 --> 06:33.360
all the money they saved was
for me to go to Oxford.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.960
OK. You're not getting cold feet
about Weston, are you?

06:38.960 --> 06:40.560
No.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.440
No, I...I...

06:42.440 --> 06:45.240
..I just want to approach it
really carefully,

06:45.240 --> 06:47.760
you know? Um,
so I told them we'd come over,

06:47.760 --> 06:50.640
bring dinner, then once they've
sampled your yummy food, then we'd

06:50.640 --> 06:54.560
bring up the loan.
OK. Is that OK? Yeah. You sure?

06:54.560 --> 06:56.280
Yes. OK.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.560
Can you just add a bit more chilli?
Cos Dad likes it hot.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.240
Yeah? Yeah. So do I.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.280
Eww!
Go to your room!

07:12.280 --> 07:13.800
Go to YOUR room!

07:16.040 --> 07:21.120
Es, how would you like to move
to Weston with us,

07:21.120 --> 07:24.280
to open a food shack,
start selling my food?

07:24.280 --> 07:26.360
Why would people pay for your food?

07:26.360 --> 07:28.120
Cos it's different.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.200
Come on, Es.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.920
Don't you want to live by the beach?
You know, sun, sea, donkeys.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.560
More people are killed by donkeys

07:35.560 --> 07:37.680
every year than die in
plane crashes.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.160
So...is that a yes?

07:42.600 --> 07:46.360
Fine. But if a donkey
even looks at me funny,

07:46.360 --> 07:48.440
I'm moving back to Bristol.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.560
Excuse me.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.800
Excuse me, madam, this is private property.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.800
For your own safety, I'm going to
have to ask you

08:03.800 --> 08:06.120
to step on to the pavement, please.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.440
OK. Legally, we are now safe.
How can I help?

08:09.440 --> 08:13.320
Right, well, I live at number 14,
just across the road.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.160
You look like you're in charge.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.080
Your eyes do not deceive you.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.640
I thought I should let
you know that of

08:19.640 --> 08:24.280
an evening there's often comings
and goings in the centre.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.160
What, post-6pm?

08:28.160 --> 08:30.120
Yes. Sometimes late into the night.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.800
Can I take your name, please?

08:33.800 --> 08:36.000
Barbara Latham.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.560
I'm not being nosey or nothing,
I just thought it was

08:38.560 --> 08:41.760
a bit odd, you know? It's been empty
for so long and then...

08:41.760 --> 08:44.560
Can you describe these comings
and goings, please, Barbara?

08:44.560 --> 08:47.520
Not really, I'd need to move my sofa
to get a proper look.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.120
That would be great, if you could.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.600
Sofa's quite heavy, though,
and I'm on my own.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.880
Right, well, you've got to bend at
the knees, you see?

08:53.880 --> 08:57.080
Really engage the core.
Use the breath.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.320
Breathe in. Lift. OK?

08:59.320 --> 09:00.800
Oi.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.600
Yeah? Get a good vantage point.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.440
Take photos. Have you got a
telephoto lens? No.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.240
No? Well you can
pick 'em up cheap on eBay,

09:09.240 --> 09:10.840
OK? Look,

09:10.840 --> 09:13.360
if you see
anything suspicious, call me.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.120
Right.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.160
Shouldn't I call the police?

09:19.160 --> 09:20.600
Read the card, Barbara.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.320
I'm a Trainee Police Community
Support Officer.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.880
Round here, I am the law,
OK? Unless you get mugged

09:27.880 --> 09:31.760
or raped,
in which case, call the real police.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.520
I need you three
to pick up supplies for me.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.160
Supplies? Of what?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.560
Raw product.
Then bring it here tonight,

09:40.560 --> 09:43.200
where a cook will cook it.
Ready for sale.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.640
Why do we have to do that?

09:44.640 --> 09:47.560
Because look at you -
no-one will suspect you.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.560
Well, why can't you do it? Because I
have to drive around intimidating

09:50.560 --> 09:52.960
little children that work for us.
Would you rather do that?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.600
I don't want to do that, I don't
know anything about buying drugs.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.040
Could you just figure it out?!

09:58.160 --> 10:01.480
No-one taught me how to run
a drug empire in school, either.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.120
I'd love to help,

10:08.120 --> 10:11.200
but I promised my daughter
I'd visit my ex-wife.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.440
If we're cooking crack cocaine,
YOU'RE cooking crack cocaine.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.200
Nah, leave him, leave him.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.480
He's fixing things with his family.
That's important. Yeah.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.240
OK, so I'm signing you up
for Tinder.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.760
No, I don't want to be one

10:24.760 --> 10:27.440
of those sad, desperate losers
on a dating app.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.440
All right, fine. I'll delete it.
I guess it is just a load of people

10:30.440 --> 10:33.360
looking for meaningless sex. Well,
I suppose I could give it one go.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.680
No Greg, I think you're right.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.080
I think we should ease you in more
gently. Maybe Eharmony?

10:37.080 --> 10:39.680
Isn't that mainly over-50s?
Yeah.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.840
How old do you think I am?

10:40.840 --> 10:43.000
We'll need a sexy profile pic.
Have you got any photos

10:43.000 --> 10:45.560
of you on holiday,
or maybe with a cute animal?

10:45.560 --> 10:49.200
Ooh, yeah. I've got a nice one of me
on Clacton Beach with a dead squid.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.360
Three, two, one, go!

10:52.360 --> 10:55.920
Oh, yeah, I mean...
maybe take your glasses off?

10:55.920 --> 10:57.320
Glasses off? Yeah, rock and roll.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.360
Yeah. Absolutely. OK. Aww. Smile.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.680
You look like a Victorian
child-catcher.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.800
Let's try a pout, OK?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.920
So, say, "Prunes."

11:08.920 --> 11:12.280
Ooh, you look like someone's
doing something

11:12.280 --> 11:15.600
to you without your consent.
Greg, just...

11:15.600 --> 11:18.480
I'm out of my depth here.
If I can't even pose for a photo,

11:18.480 --> 11:20.920
what am I going to be like on a
real date?

11:20.920 --> 11:22.760
Maybe I can change the filter.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.040
Yeah? Can you filter out
middle-aged and desperation?

11:25.040 --> 11:28.120
No. But that's a great idea for
an app.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.800
I'm getting Greg back on
the dating horse

11:30.800 --> 11:32.680
and he needs a bit of practice.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.000
And this affects me how?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.600
Would you go on a
trial date with him? What?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.960
You know, just to report back,
let me know how he does,

11:40.960 --> 11:43.680
so that we can iron out any wrinkles
before he goes on any real dates.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.240
Definitely not.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.880
I find Greg not only unattractive
but sexually repugnant.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.920
No offence taken.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.280
Mmm. You see, the thing is, Diane,

11:53.280 --> 11:56.040
I need a woman I can trust to give
me an independent

11:56.040 --> 11:59.200
heterosexual female
assessment of Greg's behaviour.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.760
I can't be seen socialising with
criminals. I mean,

12:01.760 --> 12:04.240
not only am I his community
support supervisor,

12:04.240 --> 12:05.960
I'm also a trainee PCSO now.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.200
But I need, you know,
a dating detective.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.080
Do you need fingerprints?

12:12.080 --> 12:13.720
DNA? Swab of the foreskin?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.760
Whatever you think is useful,

12:16.760 --> 12:19.480
but you would be doing me
a massive solid.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.240
Go on, then.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.200
But only for the purposes
of research.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.200
Fabulous, thank you.
I owe you one, darling.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.160
I'll pick you up at 19:00 hours. Oh,
would you mind if he picks you up,

12:28.160 --> 12:29.640
just to keep it more traditional?

12:29.640 --> 12:32.120
I'll allow it. Don't be late.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.880
No, ma'am.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
It must be so boring being
a drug runner.

12:50.840 --> 12:54.080
Sitting around and doing...nothing.

12:55.280 --> 12:59.720
Just...waiting and keeping lookout.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.760
I'd be so bored.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.280
Nope, grey.
What are we looking for?

13:18.280 --> 13:21.120
We are looking for
a green Volkswagen Golf,

13:21.120 --> 13:23.760
and the driver has
a scar underneath his left eye.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.520
Jesus. Of course he does.
Jesus. This is not happening.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.240
I'm a middle-aged bloke with a wife
and two kids, you know.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.960
I should be bleeding radiators or
creosoting a shed,

13:32.960 --> 13:34.920
not sat here waiting to pick up

13:34.920 --> 13:38.960
a kilo of uncut shitting cocaine!
Forget it. Not doing it. Too late.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.600
Shit. Oh, shit. Shit!
What do we do now? What do we do?

13:44.600 --> 13:45.960
I don't know!

13:45.960 --> 13:48.160
I'll just consult my black-person
manual, shall I?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.120
"Car Park Drug Deals -
chapter five."

13:50.120 --> 13:53.080
Oh, window. Oh, shit,
we're doing this. Oh, fuck my life.

13:58.680 --> 14:02.160
Hello, all right? Yo.
Is it G... Are you G?

14:02.160 --> 14:04.000
Good afternoon, officer.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.120
No, I'm not... I'm not a policeman.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.560
No? What do you do, then?

14:07.560 --> 14:11.440
Me? Well, I'm...
I'm between jobs at the moment

14:11.440 --> 14:14.320
because no-one's hiring a white,
middle-aged bloke these days,

14:14.320 --> 14:15.560
are they?

14:15.560 --> 14:18.040
Unless you're disabled or a
transgender vegan that's...

14:18.040 --> 14:19.560
Not...not...not now. Not now?

14:19.560 --> 14:21.160
You got the four bags?

14:21.160 --> 14:24.360
No, cos I think we're
buying them from you.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.880
Bag o' sand, grand.
Four grand. You got the four grand?

14:27.880 --> 14:30.400
We're from Bristol.
We don't do rhyming slang.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.120
Wait, if you call a grand
a bag of sand,

14:33.120 --> 14:36.880
just interested, what do you
call a bag of sand?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.520
You got the money?
Yeah.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.400
Shit, man!

14:44.400 --> 14:46.880
Don't wave it around like
a game show host!

14:46.880 --> 14:48.160
Put it in something!

14:48.160 --> 14:49.960
Er, have a look in the
glove compartment.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.080
Anything?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.960
No. Just some middle-of-the-road
white man music

14:56.960 --> 15:00.000
and an underwear catalogue that
seems to be catering

15:00.000 --> 15:01.680
for women with a fuller bust.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.520
What is this? Porn for cowards?

15:03.520 --> 15:06.440
Just my wife's.
It's OK. I've got an envelope.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.560
An envelope. I've got an envelope.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.400
There we go.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.720
No!

15:13.400 --> 15:16.200
Right. You've put the money in?
I've done... Yeah.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.640
Get out... Yeah. ..and pretend to
drop your keys. Drop your keys.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.880
Leave the money on
the front-right tyre.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.160
He said, leave the money on
the front-right tyre.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.520
Then walk inside, get a coffee.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.280
He said, go get a coff...
I don't drink coffee.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.880
It makes me all kinds of wired.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.560
Is peppermint tea OK?

15:32.560 --> 15:35.120
Listen
It don't matter what you drink.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.640
Just go away, come back in ten,

15:37.640 --> 15:41.200
and the product will be where
the money is. You get me, right?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.920
Yeah.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.400
Go, then.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.960
Oh... Butterfingers!

16:02.000 --> 16:03.440
I've got 'em.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.160
Come on... We're coming. We're
coming. Oh, my God, it's there. OK.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.560
So, I have to...

16:21.560 --> 16:23.000
Oh. Do you know,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.680
I do not know what's wrong
with me today.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.280
Just wait, wait, wait. Jesus Christ!

16:48.600 --> 16:49.920
Hey, Mum.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.080
Look who's come to see you.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.520
Hey, Lou.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.680
Does she even know we're here?

17:01.680 --> 17:03.080
She doesn't talk any more,

17:03.080 --> 17:05.120
so we don't know how much
she knows.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.040
Frank is going to
take you for a walk today.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.440
Nice wheels you got there.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.080
Little different
from that Alfa Romeo we used

17:22.080 --> 17:23.840
to skip around in.

17:25.440 --> 17:29.240
Remember that time we drove all
the way to London just

17:29.240 --> 17:32.960
to see the sun rise over
Tower Bridge?

17:35.320 --> 17:39.320
We broke down on
the freeway coming back.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.240
I flagged down that guy,

17:42.240 --> 17:45.680
persuaded him to swap his
Hillman for the Alfa Romeo.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.320
I wo... I wonder if he ever made
it home.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.160
I'm sorry... I didn't visit earlier.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.600
I've been busy.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.280
Remind me of the brief again?
Just choose an outfit you think

18:10.280 --> 18:13.360
will make a good first impression
on a first date. Oh, I got it.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.800
Leather trousers?

18:19.800 --> 18:22.200
Yeah. I read in
GQ Magazine that every man should

18:22.200 --> 18:25.000
have at least one peacocking item
that really makes him stand out.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.880
Right, right.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.040
But you've...you've paired
the leather trousers

18:29.040 --> 18:30.800
with loafers and a shirt and tie?

18:30.800 --> 18:33.000
I have, yeah,
yeah. Adding a bit of class.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.200
You look like the
Hell's Angels' accountant.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.760
Thank you. Greg, that's not a
compliment. It doesn't work.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.800
Why not?

18:40.800 --> 18:44.520
Jim Morrison - regional manager
of a Morrisons.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.320
Come on!

19:05.440 --> 19:07.040
Does he want me to pull over?

19:07.040 --> 19:11.280
You can't. What? Don't pull over!

19:11.280 --> 19:13.200
No, he's... Shit!

19:13.200 --> 19:15.760
Shit! You've got
a kilo of coke in your bag!

19:15.760 --> 19:18.200
Oh, this is not happening!
What do we do? Stay calm!

19:18.200 --> 19:21.280
What happens, though? You just have
to act like you have not got a care

19:21.280 --> 19:23.400
in the world. Oh...!

19:32.040 --> 19:36.360
♪ You're beautiful,
you're beautiful

19:38.080 --> 19:40.760
♪ You're beautiful, it's true

19:43.040 --> 19:47.760
♪ I saw your face
in a crowded space... ♪

19:47.760 --> 19:50.520
Can you turn the music down
please, sir?

19:50.520 --> 19:53.560
♪ And I don't know... #
Sure, sorry.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.960
Is there a problem, officer?

19:57.960 --> 20:01.000
You were doing 40 in
a 30mph zone.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.480
Do you know, I literally didn't know
that that was a 30.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.800
I assume you understand
the dangers of driving over

20:06.800 --> 20:08.680
the speed limit in a built-up area?

20:08.680 --> 20:10.280
Listen,

20:10.280 --> 20:13.920
I know that Highway Code like
the back of my hand. Licence.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.280
Sorry.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.880
Are you all right?
Yeah.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.040
He just prides himself on being
a really good driver.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.600
He's a bit embarrassed.
Hopefully, three points

20:23.600 --> 20:26.360
and a 100-quid fine will make him be
a bit more careful in the future.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.720
Three points?!
One minute.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.680
Three points?! Are you...?

20:30.680 --> 20:33.880
You should be out there catching
criminals, mate. Three points!

20:33.880 --> 20:37.760
Thank you, Officer,
and once again, we are really sorry!

20:37.760 --> 20:40.800
Three points.
That is...that is madness!

20:40.800 --> 20:43.600
Would you rather have 20 years in
jail for drug-dealing?

20:43.600 --> 20:45.600
You all right?

20:45.600 --> 20:48.520
No, I feel... Oh...
I feel like I can't breathe.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.080
Oh, God. You're hyperventilating.
Hold on.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.720
Oh, God.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.800
Myrna, seriously, I'm...

20:56.800 --> 20:59.400
Take that. Breathe into that.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.520
Better?

21:02.520 --> 21:04.320
It's bloody plastic!

21:04.320 --> 21:07.480
Just take small breaths and try
and stay calm.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.320
I don't like it, Myrna.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.200
Right. Here we go. Try some of that.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.400
It is herbal, it will calm
you down.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.600
What the f...?! No! What is that?!
You're supposed to dab some behind

21:17.600 --> 21:19.200
your ears! Oh, for Christ's sake!

21:19.200 --> 21:21.320
Oh, Christ's sake, Myrna!
Oh, God!

21:27.400 --> 21:29.400
Bad luck, Reg.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.880
Come on, Stanley.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.600
Bad luck, fellas.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.880
Want to go again?

21:35.880 --> 21:39.200
Oh, seriously? You're unbelievable.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.480
Dennis here
is the unbelievable one.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.840
Three winning shots on
the bounce.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.560
I think he's hustling me.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.120
So, you can't even spend
half an hour with her?

21:49.120 --> 21:51.800
Margie,
she has no idea what's happening.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.000
Do you even understand why
that's wrong?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.600
I have to level with you.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.040
Seeing her like this
makes me feel bad.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.960
It isn't about you. When she got
sick, you never visited her,

22:00.960 --> 22:03.520
you just pretended she didn't exist.
Well, she does exist,

22:03.520 --> 22:06.320
and if seeing her makes you feel
bad, then that's tough!

22:06.320 --> 22:07.640
Whoa.

22:07.640 --> 22:10.640
Mum?!

22:10.640 --> 22:12.200
Get a...get a nurse!

22:33.240 --> 22:36.520
Hello, Rani.
Hello, Mum.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.080
Come in, come in.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.760
Shoes off at the door, please.
Yeah, sure.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.120
I don't want any scratches on
my floor.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.280
There are no scratches on the floor.
Because it's shoes off at

22:51.280 --> 22:54.760
the door!
Please, put on some slippers.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.360
You can wear an old pair of mine.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.520
Yeah, you don't have to wear those.

23:00.720 --> 23:05.200
No, I've... I've never had a pair of
slippers before. Oh.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.120
They're...they're lush.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.960
Oh, good.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.280
I hope you're hungry.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.960
Oh, yes! Please,
it's through there.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.160
Thank you.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.200
Evening, Diane. You look nice.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.960
Subject is three minutes late
and did not,

23:36.960 --> 23:40.360
I repeat, not bring
flowers. Breathe.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.960
Breath, adequate.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.320
Aftershave, vinegary.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.240
You going to do this all night?
As I see fit.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.840
I just think it might ruin
the mood.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.560
Subject questions methodology of
the adjudicator.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.080
Bye, Mum!

24:00.160 --> 24:01.840
Subject picks up hot date in

24:01.840 --> 24:06.720
a beige 2012 Skoda Octavia.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.800
Makes him look like
a Bulgarian minicab driver.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.760
Vehicle interior smells
like balls and Glade.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.080
Happy to go?

24:21.080 --> 24:22.680
Yeah, let's get this over with.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.640
Oh, I'm going to
have to crack a window.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.000
Sorry, sorry.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.640
You're not what I expected.
You're late.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.040
Sorry, yeah.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.440
We just...we just had a bit of a
run-in with the...

24:49.440 --> 24:51.600
Traffic. With the traffic on the M4.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.080
You know what the traffic can be
like on the M4.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.840
My mum's the best cook in
the South West.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.560
She's Michelin-starred.
It's rude to keep her waiting.

24:59.560 --> 25:04.160
Sorry, let's...let's crack on,
shall we? No pun intended.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.800
It's just through
those double doors up there.

25:15.600 --> 25:20.000
John, there is a meeting tonight
which I cannot miss. Cop hold.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.400
What do you mean,
there is a meeting?

25:22.400 --> 25:25.280
You can't leave me
with these people.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.880
They seem nice.
They seem...? Myrna,

25:27.880 --> 25:29.920
these people cook crack for
a living!

25:29.920 --> 25:32.960
I'll only be an hour!
I don't want to do this on my own!

25:32.960 --> 25:36.760
Look, I know that today has been
rather stressful.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.000
Stressful?!

25:38.000 --> 25:40.920
I will be back in an hour.
I promise. Got to go.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.600
Listen. Listen...

25:45.200 --> 25:46.960
Myrns!

26:10.120 --> 26:12.120
You've not done this before,
have you?

26:12.120 --> 26:13.480
Can you tell?

26:13.480 --> 26:16.200
You don't look like someone who
usually deals crack.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.960
What do you need the money for?

26:17.960 --> 26:19.840
Gambling debts?

26:19.840 --> 26:21.400
Big divorce settlement?

26:21.400 --> 26:23.040
A London gangster wants to kill me.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.880
Classic.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.640
Calm your nerves.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.480
Cheers.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.200
Cheers.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.160
What's your name?

26:51.160 --> 26:53.120
John. Yours?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.560
Anastasia.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.880
Really?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.480
No.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.720
Never use your real name, John.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.080
First rule of crack-dealing.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.080
That's nice, innit?
Would you like another drink?

27:17.080 --> 27:18.720
Yeah, definitely.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.280
Excuse me.
Can I have another Grolsch

27:21.280 --> 27:23.560
for me, and a white wine spritzer
for him?

27:28.120 --> 27:30.120
Why don't you ask me
some questions?

27:30.120 --> 27:32.080
Questions, yeah. Good idea, yeah.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.440
What is your favourite colour,
please?

27:36.440 --> 27:37.680
This is a date,

27:37.680 --> 27:40.280
not a Smash Hits interview.
Just ask me an adult question.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.920
Have you ever had a threesome?

27:41.920 --> 27:44.160
No, not like an
adult movie question.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.960
And, yeah, I have.
Didn't enjoy it. Too much talking.

27:46.960 --> 27:50.800
Just ask me a normal question from
one person to another.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.040
Do you have any hobbies?
No. I don't have time

27:53.040 --> 27:55.320
for hobbies.
Too busy training as a PCSO.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.680
Oh, yeah. How's that going?
Yeah, it's awesome.

27:57.680 --> 28:00.320
Incapacitant spray training last
week. That was a highlight.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.880
What does that involve?

28:01.880 --> 28:05.400
This. Pepper spray.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.280
They spray it on our faces
so we know what it feels like.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.000
They issue you with this, do they?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.680
Oh, God. No, no.
Pepper spray is illegal.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.520
So, where did you get that?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.920
Next question.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.760
It's good to see you.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.560
Yeah, yeah, you too, you too.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.360
And you're drinking water?

28:25.360 --> 28:26.720
I'm... I'm completely off

28:26.720 --> 28:29.800
the booze now. Like, for real this
time. That's great.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.320
Yeah, yeah. Oh,
and the drugs and, yeah,

28:32.320 --> 28:34.760
I got rid of all the hangers-on,
you know?

28:34.760 --> 28:38.480
Just realised that they were
actually just taking the piss.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.880
Look, Lara, I...I...

28:44.880 --> 28:48.600
..I want you to know that I have
completely sorted myself out

28:48.600 --> 28:53.320
and, well, I...I saw that
you're...you're on Her,

28:53.320 --> 28:56.560
and I thought maybe
you might want to try again.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.040
Gabby...
I'm completely clean, I promise.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.480
I mean, I don't touch a thing now,

29:00.480 --> 29:02.800
not even on weekends or on
special occasions.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.400
That's great. Yeah.
I'm pleased for you, really,

29:05.400 --> 29:06.720
I am.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.080
But I forgot
to remove my profile from Her.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.720
I'm not single.
I'm actually engaged.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.040
Er... Congratulations.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.000
Wow. Um, do I...?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.560
No.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.120
Look, I probably need to go.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.520
Of course, no, of course.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.040
It really was nice to see you.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.760
The Hardest Button To Button
by The White Stripes

29:59.840 --> 30:03.080
Where did you hide it,
you overgrown stick insect?!

30:13.560 --> 30:16.120
Who still buys DVDs, Greg?!

30:38.280 --> 30:39.920
Yes!

31:08.320 --> 31:11.480
You look...tired.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.680
Your eyes are dark. Are you
getting enough sleep? Mum.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.560
Well, then you're not drinking
enough water.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.600
Jerzy, pour Rani a glass of water.
No, I don't want any water.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.560
Yeah, you need about seven or
eight glasses.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.120
I don't want any water!

31:28.320 --> 31:30.560
You may think you are
old enough

31:30.560 --> 31:33.160
to look after yourself,
make your own decisions, but

31:33.160 --> 31:35.680
look at you. You're a mess.
Abandoning your future.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.000
I'm not talking about this.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.720
Living with a boy
with no prospects.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.280
What sort of a boy has never owned
a pair of slippers?

31:41.280 --> 31:42.480
Why are you fixating on that?

31:42.480 --> 31:45.280
Because it tells us all we need
to know about the kind of boy he is.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.400
That you are throwing your life
after some sort

31:47.400 --> 31:50.040
of low-life that we've always tried
to protect you from.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.800
Ahhhh. Wow,
smells delicious. Thank you.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.560
Ah. There's extra chilli in this
one for you,

31:56.560 --> 31:58.960
Mr Rekowski. Rani told me you like
your food hot.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.920
The hotter, the better!

32:00.920 --> 32:02.240
You make all this yourself?

32:02.240 --> 32:03.480
Yeah.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.000
I'll just be...

32:09.840 --> 32:14.040
My wife felt that we were stuck in a
rut, so Mr Romantic here surprised
her with a camping trip to Cornwall,

32:14.040 --> 32:18.080
and while I was emptying out the
chemical toilet, this chap came by
and he's like, "Oh, would you like

32:18.080 --> 32:20.800
"to do some white-water rafting
with me?" Apparently some other

32:20.800 --> 32:24.560
people had dropped out and he needed
to make up the numbers cos otherwise
he would have lost his deposit.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.440
It doesn't matter, move on. Yeah,
well, anyway I couldn't do it,
myself, because I've only got my

32:28.440 --> 32:31.440
ten-metre swimming badge. But my
wife did go with him and, um...

32:31.440 --> 32:34.000
Don't tell me. You caught that other
bloke shagging

32:34.000 --> 32:37.240
your wife's brains out. No, no.
But she fell in love with...

32:37.240 --> 32:38.680
The other bloke.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.240
Cos he's a demon in the sack

32:40.240 --> 32:42.800
and having sex with you is like
shagging a giant Pepperami.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.000
No, she fell in love with danger
and adrenaline.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.440
Oh, right. There was no
stopping her after that.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.200
She got into base jumping,
and abseiling,

32:52.200 --> 32:54.680
and doing parkour around Bristol
city centre. I mean,

32:54.680 --> 32:56.960
we'd be down in town doing
a bit of Christmas shopping,

32:56.960 --> 32:58.840
she'd suddenly be off over
the roof of Argos.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.560
She wanted us to do
a bungee jump together, to try

33:01.560 --> 33:04.040
and sort of save the marriage.
So I agreed.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.360
We got harnessed up,

33:05.360 --> 33:07.480
stood on the edge
of Clifton Suspension Bridge

33:07.480 --> 33:09.880
but I couldn't go through with it.
She jumped, looked back,

33:09.880 --> 33:11.920
saw me standing there
and just shouted,

33:11.920 --> 33:14.800
"I want a divorce!" as she
plummeted into Avon Gorge.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.320
She bounced back up and shouted,
"You're dragging me down!"

33:17.320 --> 33:20.240
even though it was gravity
dragging her down at that point,

33:20.240 --> 33:23.760
to be honest, but I understood what
she was saying,

33:23.760 --> 33:26.720
which is that I'm boring.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.680
No. You're not boring.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.320
Want to do the quiz?

33:32.320 --> 33:34.440
Yeah, for the love of God,
yeah. Thank you.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.160
Team name.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.600
Diane and Greg.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.840
Margie...
Don't talk to me.

34:00.960 --> 34:06.440
I have never tasted anything
like this. It's so...fresh.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.280
Would you give me the recipe?

34:08.280 --> 34:10.800
The recipe belongs to my grandma,
so I'm going to have

34:10.800 --> 34:13.040
to take that one to my grave!

34:13.040 --> 34:15.800
I'm really glad that you like
Ben's cooking,

34:15.800 --> 34:18.000
cos we actually have something
that we want to talk

34:18.000 --> 34:19.400
to you about.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.840
We're going to...

34:22.840 --> 34:25.280
We want to open a
food place in Weston.

34:26.840 --> 34:30.800
With my cooking and Rani's brain,
who knows?

34:30.800 --> 34:33.480
We might be able
to start our own franchise.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.880
And we were wondering if you could
give us a loan.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.160
Which we will pay back... Of course.
..once we get back on our feet.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.560
Oh! What about Oxford?

34:41.560 --> 34:43.200
That was your dream, not mine.

34:43.200 --> 34:46.040
So, a food shack in Weston.
That's your dream?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.920
Yeah.

34:53.720 --> 34:56.560
Your mother and I started
a business from scratch.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.360
It takes all of your energies.

34:58.360 --> 35:01.040
So much hard work,
you will have no free time.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.520
Yeah, I know.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.160
But I imagine

35:05.160 --> 35:07.480
the sense of achievement
must be intense.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.200
Starting a business from nothing,

35:09.200 --> 35:11.480
and raising such an amazing daughter
at the same time?

35:13.640 --> 35:16.040
What I want most is what you have.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.680
I never had a stable
upbringing. Well,

35:20.680 --> 35:23.680
you know, the thought
of starting my own business,

35:23.680 --> 35:27.480
buying my own house, wife, kids...

35:33.080 --> 35:35.000
So...

35:35.000 --> 35:38.280
..what do you think about the loan?

35:38.280 --> 35:39.840
We'll...

35:41.480 --> 35:43.000
We'll think about it.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.320
Look at the slide.

35:47.320 --> 35:50.120
14% of over-25s we surveyed

35:50.120 --> 35:52.560
said a phone mast brings no jobs to
the community.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.400
Or anything productive.
And on the next slide...

36:00.040 --> 36:03.200
What it will bring is faster
data download

36:03.200 --> 36:04.960
and upload speed,

36:04.960 --> 36:07.600
so no more waiting for Netflix
to buffer.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.880
And we're planning
to build in front of the mast site,

36:10.880 --> 36:12.440
as a voluntary contribution to

36:12.440 --> 36:15.240
the community, at our own expense,

36:15.240 --> 36:18.880
a park bench and three trees.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.720
Y-y-yes, but returning
to slide four...

36:21.720 --> 36:24.760
Oh. Just what we need. More slides.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.560
We don't need another park bench
around here, either!

36:28.560 --> 36:30.200
Where kids can go

36:30.200 --> 36:32.720
to drink or get high,
because they're so bloody bored.

36:32.720 --> 36:35.320
This guy will promise you
the moon on

36:35.320 --> 36:37.560
a string if it gets him his
planning application.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.920
But he'll be gone in a week.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.040
Me, and you,

36:41.040 --> 36:43.480
and Claire, we live here.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.320
There are kids out there as young as
nine or ten selling drugs

36:47.320 --> 36:48.880
to make ends meet.

36:48.880 --> 36:52.160
I know. I see them every day.

36:52.160 --> 36:56.800
They don't need faster mobile phone
speeds if they're dead or locked up

36:56.800 --> 36:58.520
or hooked on crack.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.080
Well...

37:00.080 --> 37:03.320
What they do need is somewhere
to go at nights,

37:03.320 --> 37:06.240
to study, to get what they need,

37:06.240 --> 37:09.560
where their parents can get therapy
or go to rehab.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.720
Or learn to dance. Mate,

37:12.720 --> 37:15.960
we don't need your phone tower
around here,

37:15.960 --> 37:20.720
what we do need is community!

37:24.120 --> 37:25.800
Plus...

37:25.800 --> 37:28.760
..5G gives you Covid-19!

37:55.080 --> 37:58.440
You like...you like cooking other
things, food, or...

38:00.640 --> 38:02.520
..just the crack?

38:20.760 --> 38:25.480
How does someone like you wind up in
trouble with a London gangster?

38:25.480 --> 38:27.960
That's a very long
and a very depressing story.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.160
We've got a while.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.680
Nah.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.040
You don't want my tale of woe.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.720
Want some?
No.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.840
You ever tried it?

38:43.840 --> 38:46.320
Have I ever smoked crack?
Er, no. No,

38:46.320 --> 38:47.840
I've never smoked crack.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.200
I'm a middle-aged married man

38:49.200 --> 38:51.080
with two kids and
a recurrent hernia.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.480
All the more reason to smoke some.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.680
No, I read the papers,
I know what that stuff's like.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.920
Instantly addictive.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.160
I'd have one puff
and in a month, I'd have no teeth

38:58.160 --> 38:59.760
and a pimp named Alphonso.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.640
No. It's nothing like
The Daily Mail says.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.160
It's just amazingly good fun.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.720
How much amazingly good fun?

39:30.720 --> 39:33.200
It will make you
forget your tale of woe.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.280
Oh, shit.

39:49.040 --> 39:51.560
No Surprises

39:54.400 --> 40:00.720
♪ A job that slowly kills you

40:02.120 --> 40:04.840
♪ Bruises that won't heal... ♪

40:04.840 --> 40:07.040
She's stable...

40:14.960 --> 40:17.560
Which famous actor is said

40:17.560 --> 40:21.720
to have invented
the Magnum ice cream?

40:21.720 --> 40:24.160
Oh, what?! Who is going to get that?

40:24.160 --> 40:27.040
Roger Moore.
He loved a choc ice

40:27.040 --> 40:29.960
but he didn't like getting chocolate
ice cream on his safari suit.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.920
So he thought, hang on, I'll pop a
stick in the end. Ergo, the Magnum.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.680
What about the picture round?
I don't know any of them.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.040
Rod Hull, Samantha Fox,
Keith Flint from The Prodigy,

40:38.040 --> 40:40.080
Kendall Jenner,
Jeffrey from Rainbow,

40:40.080 --> 40:43.320
Charles Manson, Emma Stone,
and DJ Bruno Brookes.

40:43.320 --> 40:46.800
What is the capital of Ecuador?

40:46.800 --> 40:49.120
Oh, you are havin' a laugh!
Quito.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.840
Yup, we got it. We know it.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.680
Hey...

42:09.680 --> 42:11.400
What?

42:24.680 --> 42:26.160
Anyone watching you?

42:26.160 --> 42:27.560
No.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.120
I can't see who's inside.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.400
Anyone complaining?

42:31.400 --> 42:33.000
Nah, I got compliments.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.400
Did you lose any regulars?

42:36.400 --> 42:37.840
Don't think so.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.440
Is that a yes or a no?

42:39.440 --> 42:40.840
It's a no.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.040
Don't lie to me.
I ain't.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.880
Do you know what happens when
you lie?

42:44.880 --> 42:48.040
Yeah, and I ain't lying.
You better not be.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.800
Go.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.640
Which means the runners-up,
in second place...

43:12.640 --> 43:15.560
..with 36 points, are...

43:15.560 --> 43:16.920
You're crushing my fingers.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.960
I'm sorry, it's my natural
vice-like grip.

43:18.960 --> 43:21.120
..J Lo's Arse!

43:21.120 --> 43:23.480
Which means the winners are

43:23.480 --> 43:25.280
Cagney and Lacey!

43:25.280 --> 43:27.440
Yee-haw. Woo!

43:27.440 --> 43:30.800
Losers! Losers! Losers!

43:30.800 --> 43:33.240
Oh, hello, sir,
you all right?

43:33.240 --> 43:36.080
Sorry, you just dropped something on
the floor. That! And one for you!

43:36.080 --> 43:39.080
Yeah! Wow! Oh, my God!
I've never won anything before!

43:39.080 --> 43:41.520
You are insane at quizzes!

43:41.520 --> 43:43.720
Well, thanks, yeah.
Product of a misspent youth.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.800
I played a lot of Trivial Pursuit in
my teens.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.280
Wow! Wild. Idea.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.440
You and I go back to my house,
have coffee

43:49.440 --> 43:51.680
and sexual intercourse.
I don't do tea-bagging,

43:51.680 --> 43:54.400
golden showers or reverse anal.
Everything else is up for grabs.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.280
What's reverse anal? Wouldn't that
just be regular, in the front door?

43:57.280 --> 43:59.160
No, that's what they want you to think.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.240
Hold that thought.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.720
Go for Diane Pemberley.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.640
Hello, it's Barbara.
Who?

44:04.640 --> 44:07.680
There's people in the centre, I can
see their shadows moving about.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.280
Did you get a camera?

44:09.280 --> 44:12.160
Yes, I found one in the back of
the sideboard.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.640
Er, I'm not sure how well
it'll come out,

44:14.640 --> 44:18.120
mind, it's been in
the drawer since my Kenny died.

44:18.120 --> 44:19.280
God, I miss him!

44:19.280 --> 44:22.040
Right. Stay focused,
woman. Take pictures of everything,

44:22.040 --> 44:23.520
OK? I'm coming over.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.680
I need you to drop me off at
the community centre.

44:25.680 --> 44:28.160
There ARE people inside
looking suspicious.

44:28.160 --> 44:31.000
What about the coffee
and the sexual intercourse?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.160
That's off. Look,
if this turns into a stakeout,

44:33.160 --> 44:35.120
I might give you
a quick handjob, all right?

44:35.120 --> 44:37.520
No promises, though.
Come on. Let's go.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.920
Oh, shit.
I think we're being followed.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.800
By who?
You see that black Vauxhall?

44:54.800 --> 44:57.360
It was there when we left
Windmill Hill.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.880
What do we do?

44:58.880 --> 45:01.240
Um... Er...

45:01.240 --> 45:03.040
Just, um, take a left.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.120
And-and go right, go right.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.400
Fuck! Fuck!

45:21.880 --> 45:23.800
Can you see who it is?

45:23.800 --> 45:25.400
It's the police.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.840
Go.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.520
I just got a text from
Greg, saying,

45:31.520 --> 45:34.120
"Stop cooking crack,
Diane's on her way."

45:34.120 --> 45:35.840
Oh, shit!

45:37.360 --> 45:41.520
Sweet Little Mystery
by Wet Wet Wet

45:46.200 --> 45:48.520
Yeah, my own father. Sacked you?

45:51.240 --> 45:54.760
I had a mortgage,
kids' school fees, skiing,

45:54.760 --> 45:56.680
bollocks.

45:56.680 --> 46:01.640
You know, it's £800 a year
for horse riding insurance? £800.

46:01.640 --> 46:05.200
I mean, just don't crash
your horse, right? Mm.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.080
Doesn't your wife work?

46:08.400 --> 46:13.280
She makes and sells
vegan dog treats, so, no.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.080
What's funny?

46:19.080 --> 46:20.760
Vegan dog treats!

46:20.760 --> 46:23.120
You can have vegan dogs.

46:23.120 --> 46:27.080
I think I'm beginning
to understand your tale of woe.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.920
Hello?
Are you at the community centre?

46:47.920 --> 46:49.920
No. I had to pop out for a bit.

46:49.920 --> 46:52.400
Pop out? Why are you popping out?

46:52.400 --> 46:53.960
I've left John in charge.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.000
Well, he isn't answering his phone,

46:56.000 --> 46:59.480
and Diane is on her way there,
so you have to get everyone out!

46:59.480 --> 47:01.480
I'm busy. Why can't you?!

47:01.480 --> 47:03.320
I'm in a police car chase!

47:03.320 --> 47:06.280
What did you say?!
I don't think I heard you right!

47:06.280 --> 47:08.920
I bet you wish you had 5G.

47:08.920 --> 47:11.160
Hello? Hello?!

47:11.160 --> 47:13.840
Why are you driving so slowly?!
Have you heard of second gear?!

47:13.840 --> 47:16.240
A little kiddie might jump out.
Kiddie? It's night-time!

47:16.240 --> 47:18.480
You're doing about 8mph.
Speed kills.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.000
What are you doing?!

47:22.000 --> 47:24.480
Don't wave him on.
Don't let him overtake you!

47:24.480 --> 47:26.520
Well, you know,
I'm just feeling generous.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.360
Oh, my God!

47:28.360 --> 47:31.240
Subject drives like my nan. Well,
you know, there's a lot of idiots on

47:31.240 --> 47:33.560
the road at this time of night.
You've got to be careful.

47:33.560 --> 47:35.680
Yeah, idiots like you.
Number one over here.

47:35.680 --> 47:38.320
She's going faster than we are.
With her stupid little scooter.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.840
Yeah, well, but that's reckless,
isn't it? Absolutely reckless.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.640
It's not reckless. Go through,
we're coming up to the lights.
That's good.

47:43.640 --> 47:46.040
Right, amber, go through on
the amber, go through on the amber!

47:46.040 --> 47:49.760
Well, you shouldn't go through on
the amber. No, cos it might change
to red. You see, there you go.

47:49.760 --> 47:52.080
You've got to be careful.
Oh, my God.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.760
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

47:54.760 --> 47:56.640
What are you up to? What's going on?

47:56.640 --> 48:00.040
I'm commandeering this vehicle for
volunteer police purposes.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.920
It's Haines.
We're following a black Range Rover.

48:02.920 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, I need you to run a plate
for me, please.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.680
They still there?

48:08.680 --> 48:12.880
Yeah. OK. What am I doing?
Where am I going?

48:12.880 --> 48:15.280
Rani, what now? They're behind us!

48:15.280 --> 48:18.680
Calm down! I'm trying to think!
Go right, go right!

48:24.200 --> 48:25.960
We need to lose them. Fuck!

48:25.960 --> 48:29.240
The vehicle is leased to
a Christian Taylor.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.080
We need to overtake that lorry
there. Taylor's in prison.

48:32.080 --> 48:33.800
It's his car.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.120
Go, go, go!

48:41.960 --> 48:43.280
Wait for it.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.960
Now, pull off. Pull off!

48:58.400 --> 49:00.080
Where...where are they?

49:01.760 --> 49:04.480
Where are they? I can't see 'em.

49:06.640 --> 49:08.320
Shit!

49:11.160 --> 49:12.600
We have to find that Range.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.960
Whoever is driving that
is running Brook Hill.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.160
My heart's racing.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.560
That was incredible!
That was so cool!

49:37.800 --> 49:40.600
Wait, Rani, wait!
That weren't cool.

49:40.600 --> 49:44.880
Yeah, it was.
We totally out-foxed them. So cool.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.920
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Yeah?

49:46.920 --> 49:48.560
Does this stuff turn you on?

49:48.560 --> 49:50.160
What stuff?

49:50.160 --> 49:51.440
You know...

49:51.440 --> 49:53.960
..car chases, the drug deals,
the gang shit.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.760
No, of course not.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.280
It doesn't. Just...

49:59.280 --> 50:01.840
It must be my adrenaline pumping.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.000
We need to get rid of this car.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.960
What...is going on?!

50:29.320 --> 50:32.760
Myrns. I'm a crack ho.

50:32.760 --> 50:34.520
What?!

50:34.520 --> 50:36.320
Diane is coming!

50:36.320 --> 50:38.280
We need to get out of here!

50:38.280 --> 50:41.560
Diane is on her way here!

50:41.560 --> 50:44.280
We need to pack up
and get out of here now!

50:44.280 --> 50:47.200
We need to pack up
and get out of here! Come on, move!

50:47.200 --> 50:51.840
♪ No alarms and no surprises,
please... ♪

50:53.360 --> 50:54.920
I'm coming, Dad.

51:11.320 --> 51:13.920
What have we got here, then?

51:15.240 --> 51:17.080
Light on at the side of
the building.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.880
Moving to investigate.

51:18.880 --> 51:22.640
Hmm. Gate is unlocked.
Note to self.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.920
Diane.
What?

51:24.920 --> 51:27.040
I have to tell you something before
you go in there.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.360
Well, it'll have to wait.
No. It can't wait.

51:29.360 --> 51:32.200
I have to tell you it now.
The reason

51:32.200 --> 51:35.400
I was driving so slow earlier,
like your nan,

51:35.400 --> 51:37.280
is so that I could

51:37.280 --> 51:40.040
spend more time with you

51:40.040 --> 51:43.280
and enjoy your magical personality.
Yeah, makes sense.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.360
Yeah, but there's more.

51:47.840 --> 51:51.360
Diane Pemberley... I love you.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.640
Well, you're only human.
Yeah!

52:03.320 --> 52:05.000
Ahh!

52:06.480 --> 52:08.080
God...!

52:09.240 --> 52:12.880
I had to incapacitate subject, as
his libido became inflamed by his

52:12.880 --> 52:14.920
smoking-hot date.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.360
Heading inside to
investigate further.

52:17.360 --> 52:19.520
What's in it?! What's in it?!

52:21.720 --> 52:23.240
I need a wet wipe!

52:25.600 --> 52:27.000
I am entering the premises.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.560
Diane?

52:58.560 --> 53:02.000
I can't drive you home,
cos I'm blind now.

53:07.960 --> 53:10.480
Christian is going to be so pissed.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.480
He only had six months
left on the lease.

53:21.640 --> 53:24.000
I'm going to get a tea,
do you want one?

53:26.080 --> 53:27.160
No.

53:41.840 --> 53:45.760
We swore we'd never be that couple
with nothing to say

53:45.760 --> 53:48.560
to each other. Remember?

53:48.560 --> 53:50.800
When we met,

53:50.800 --> 53:55.240
you taught ME the shuffle,
the backdrop.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.680
King and queen of the dance floor.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.920
We were a head-turning couple.

54:03.560 --> 54:05.440
Being busy is not

54:05.440 --> 54:08.640
the reason I didn't visit when you
got sick, Lou.

54:08.640 --> 54:12.600
It's cos I was in a pub,
getting high.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.200
Getting laid.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.840
Cos all of that was

54:17.840 --> 54:20.120
100 times easier than
facing you,

54:20.120 --> 54:22.360
cos facing you meant facing me,

54:22.360 --> 54:23.880
and I never could do that.

54:25.120 --> 54:29.720
I missed my chance
to say sorry...when it mattered.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.320
What the heck,
I'm going to say it now.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.120
Anyway, I'm sorry,

54:38.120 --> 54:42.240
I'm sorry you had
to put up with all the lies,

54:42.240 --> 54:45.280
then apologies, then more lies, and...

54:46.680 --> 54:49.240
..I'm sorry for the things I did
when I was here

54:49.240 --> 54:51.640
and the things I didn't do
when I wasn't.

54:51.640 --> 54:53.400
And I'm sorry I didn't get

54:53.400 --> 54:55.320
to know our little girl earlier.

54:55.320 --> 54:58.160
You raised a
helluva woman without me, Lou.

54:59.280 --> 55:02.480
You know, I don't have
a pot to piss in.

55:03.840 --> 55:05.200
All I got to show

55:05.200 --> 55:08.200
for my time on this Earth
is what I walked out on.

55:09.560 --> 55:12.760
So, let's us - you and me...

55:14.320 --> 55:16.160
..remember the good times.

55:19.240 --> 55:21.800
We were king...

55:21.800 --> 55:25.160
..queen of the dance floor.

55:26.440 --> 55:27.800
We were...

55:29.320 --> 55:30.800
..a head-turning couple.

56:08.840 --> 56:11.040
Excuse me.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.440
Shoes off at the door, yeah?

56:16.880 --> 56:19.560
Those are not my dad's slippers,
are they?

56:19.560 --> 56:21.240
No. They're mine.

56:21.240 --> 56:23.520
He let me keep 'em.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.480
You don't have to wear them, though.

56:25.480 --> 56:27.480
Yeah, well,
they're kind of snuggly.

56:29.760 --> 56:32.560
Erm, do you really want kids?

56:32.560 --> 56:35.120
Yeah, don't you?

56:35.120 --> 56:37.080
We never spoke about it.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.720
I think we'd make great parents.
