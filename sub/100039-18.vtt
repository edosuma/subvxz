<i>In 1847, the American
Medical Association</i>

00:07.487 --> 00:10.711
<i>published its code of ethics,

00:10.787 --> 00:13.735

00:15.762 --> 00:16.662
Hey, Mer.

00:16.696 --> 00:17.997
Karev, you're late.

00:18.031 --> 00:20.933
It's 5:00 a.m.,
and it's not Karev anymore.

00:20.967 --> 00:22.067
Fair enough. What is it?

00:22.102 --> 00:23.528
I don't know yet.

00:23.562 --> 00:24.603
Okay, Jo.

00:24.638 --> 00:26.705
You're late, and it's
Pro Bono Surgery Day.

00:26.740 --> 00:28.007
I have 25 patients to get through

00:28.074 --> 00:29.842
and only four general surgeons.

00:29.909 --> 00:32.110
And, Jo, you need to work.

00:32.145 --> 00:33.445
You know it, and I know it.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.813
So get your ass in here.

00:44.024 --> 00:46.091
<i>Hospitals were meant
to be centers to care</i>

00:46.159 --> 00:47.860
<i>for the sick and poor.</i>

00:47.894 --> 00:51.864
<i>They were meant to be places
of refuge, places to heal.</i>

00:51.898 --> 00:54.326
<i>But somewhere along
the way, that changed.</i>

00:57.414 --> 00:58.447
I brought the forms back.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.050
Dr. Grey, if I may,

01:01.084 --> 01:02.785
you were already a legend, but this...

01:02.853 --> 01:05.654
I mean, I don't know what
comes after "legend," but...

01:05.689 --> 01:07.823
Helm. It's not about me. Stop it.

01:07.858 --> 01:10.159
<i>Healthcare became a commodity sold to</i>

01:10.193 --> 01:11.327
<i>those who can afford it...</i>

01:18.368 --> 01:20.469
She's such a legend.

01:20.504 --> 01:21.771
This isn't about her, Brody.

01:21.838 --> 01:23.105
Stop it.

01:23.140 --> 01:26.041
<i>...rather than a physician's
dutiful service to the public.</i>

01:32.416 --> 01:33.349
Hey.

01:33.383 --> 01:35.184
Ready to see Mavis
break the record tonight?

01:35.218 --> 01:38.220
Uh, I-I can't go to
a basketball game tonight.

01:38.255 --> 01:39.522
But I got courtside seats.

01:39.589 --> 01:40.923
- Yeah, I know. I...
- Uh, one of his

01:40.957 --> 01:42.091
fellow firefighters died.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.627
Threw a PE right as we were
about to discharge him.

01:44.694 --> 01:45.895
Ohh. I'm really sorry.

01:45.929 --> 01:47.363
Yeah, of course. Do what you need to do.

01:47.431 --> 01:49.231
- Thanks, man.
- Hey.

01:49.266 --> 01:50.966
- Mwah.
- Bye.

01:51.001 --> 01:52.802
Surgical diagnostics complete.

01:52.836 --> 01:55.204
This is that mobile surgery
unit we paid for, huh?

01:55.238 --> 01:57.873
Yeah. You, uh, come by the station,

01:57.908 --> 01:59.308
give you a tour.

01:59.333 --> 02:00.376
Yeah.

02:00.410 --> 02:01.677
Mission response team requested...

02:04.448 --> 02:06.148
That truck is dope.

02:06.183 --> 02:08.616
It's Grey's Pro Bono Surgery Day.

02:08.685 --> 02:10.252
Get excited about that.

02:10.287 --> 02:11.487
Hey.

02:11.521 --> 02:13.322
What are you doing here so early?

02:13.356 --> 02:15.291
Uh, force of habit.

02:15.325 --> 02:16.559
And if you're trying to talk me into

02:16.593 --> 02:19.028
operating again, don't.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.297
If I thought it would work,
I would, but, no,

02:21.331 --> 02:22.798
I wanted to tell you that I got a call

02:22.833 --> 02:24.400
from the lawyer yesterday.

02:24.468 --> 02:26.168
And you were right. Your brother settled.

02:26.236 --> 02:28.104
So I really appreciate you
helping me through that.

02:28.138 --> 02:30.439
And, um, I hope that
Chris finds some peace.

02:30.474 --> 02:34.276
Well, I got a call from
a lawyer yesterday, too.

02:34.311 --> 02:36.556
Separation papers.

02:37.047 --> 02:39.348
Catherine's lawyer was letting me know

02:39.382 --> 02:43.052
how generous she is by
letting me keep my own house.

02:43.086 --> 02:45.921
Oh, my God. I am so sorry, Richard.

02:45.956 --> 02:48.266
No one's sorrier than I am.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.391
Richard?

02:49.426 --> 02:50.539
Meredith, no, okay?

02:50.573 --> 02:52.862
I haven't even asked you anything yet.

02:52.896 --> 02:54.449
Okay, fine.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.932
I need to put you on the board today.

02:56.967 --> 02:58.834
Just a few hernias, or lap cholies.

02:58.869 --> 03:00.102
You choose.

03:00.137 --> 03:02.705
It... The pro bono day is... is just...

03:02.739 --> 03:04.840
Meredith, what...?

03:04.908 --> 03:07.376
Come on. I already
lost one friend this week.

03:07.410 --> 03:08.444
Can't lose you, too.

03:08.478 --> 03:10.105
Look, I'm... I'm still your friend.

03:10.130 --> 03:13.182
I'm... I'm just not your surgeon.

03:17.053 --> 03:18.487
Link's the father.

03:18.522 --> 03:20.356
I know Maggie told you
that it might be Owen's,

03:20.390 --> 03:21.790
but it's not.

03:23.426 --> 03:24.393
Hi, Jo.

03:24.461 --> 03:25.895
I already knew.

03:25.929 --> 03:28.464
Link sent me a Bitmoji
last night of a baby's body

03:28.498 --> 03:30.165
with his face on it, which I can't unsee.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.301
Well, that's...
that's great news.

03:32.335 --> 03:33.402
I'm happy for you... both of you...

03:33.436 --> 03:35.104
all of us, I guess, right?

03:35.138 --> 03:36.405
- Yeah. Yep.
- Yeah.

03:36.439 --> 03:37.773
- Okay. I'll see you upstairs.
- Yeah.

03:37.807 --> 03:39.077
Congrats.

03:39.576 --> 03:41.810
I'm sorry you guys
got tangled up in this,

03:41.845 --> 03:45.814
even for a moment, but now
we can just move forward.

03:45.882 --> 03:48.017
Full steam ahead, right?

03:50.754 --> 03:52.087
Thank you. Right here.

03:52.122 --> 03:54.089
Has a Jared Goldstein checked in here?

03:54.157 --> 03:55.024
He hasn't shown up yet.

03:55.058 --> 03:57.426
I thought he might have
come to the clinic by accident.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.594
Doesn't sound familiar.

03:58.628 --> 04:00.462
We're giving him a lap chole.

04:00.497 --> 04:02.364
For free. Or, uh, Bailey is.

04:02.399 --> 04:03.832
It's, uh... It's great, right?

04:03.867 --> 04:06.135
Wouldn't know. I'm stuck here.

04:06.469 --> 04:07.703
DeLuca, are you okay?

04:07.771 --> 04:09.772
I'm fine. Move.

04:09.806 --> 04:11.974
Okay, Cindy Wright.

04:12.008 --> 04:13.342
I'm Dr. DeLuca. How can I help you?

04:13.376 --> 04:15.477
She has a bulge in her stomach.

04:15.512 --> 04:16.512
And you are...?

04:16.546 --> 04:18.380
Uh, her aunt, Opal.

04:18.415 --> 04:21.327
Okay, Cindy, let me
take a look at you here.

04:22.185 --> 04:23.886
All right.

04:25.441 --> 04:26.641
Does that hurt, Cindy?

04:26.666 --> 04:27.833
She said that she's a six on a...

04:27.858 --> 04:29.558
I asked Cindy.

04:29.583 --> 04:30.683
Hmm?

04:30.708 --> 04:31.860
A little.

04:31.895 --> 04:33.329
Did you do anything strenuous lately?

04:33.363 --> 04:34.330
Maybe you lifted something heavy?

04:34.364 --> 04:35.698
We moved a refrigerator.

04:35.732 --> 04:36.999
She helps me clean houses.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.929
It's kind of a family business.

04:39.569 --> 04:41.003
On the count of three,
I want you to hold your breath

04:41.037 --> 04:42.641
and bear down for me, okay?

04:43.206 --> 04:45.007
One, two, three.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.281
Whoa. Okay.

04:46.316 --> 04:48.544
You've definitely got
a hernia in your abdomen here.

04:48.578 --> 04:50.479
We can repair that
with a very easy surgery.

04:50.513 --> 04:51.780
Super simple.

04:51.815 --> 04:54.249
But, uh, is there any other
symptoms I should know about?

04:54.274 --> 04:56.642
It also burns when she pees.

04:56.686 --> 04:57.586
She's embarrassed,

04:57.621 --> 04:59.188
but I told her it's probably just a UTI.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.357
Could be. Uh, but I'll need
to do a more thorough exam.

05:01.391 --> 05:04.460
You're welcome to wait in
the family area right over here.

05:04.494 --> 05:07.296
Um, she has some abandonment issues.

05:07.330 --> 05:09.298
Her... Her parents
left her when she was 4.

05:09.332 --> 05:11.367
Is it okay if I just stay?

05:14.571 --> 05:16.171
Sure. Um, you know what?

05:16.239 --> 05:17.539
Cindy, why don't you
put this gown on for me?

05:17.607 --> 05:19.094
And I'll be right back.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.586
Good morning. Welcome
to Pro Bono Surgery Day.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.055
I appreciate you all rearranging
your schedules to be here.

05:33.089 --> 05:35.024
I would make a speech,
but we don't really have the time

05:35.058 --> 05:37.192
because Koracick pulls the plug at 7:00.

05:37.227 --> 05:39.495
So, all the beds turn into pumpkins.

05:39.529 --> 05:41.363
At least Cinderella had until midnight.

05:42.632 --> 05:45.501
Did you have to pick today
to start telling jokes, Hunt?

05:45.535 --> 05:47.670
You know what they call
Pro Bono Surgery Day in Ireland?

05:47.737 --> 05:48.837
Every day.

05:48.872 --> 05:50.973
Great. More jokes.

05:51.007 --> 05:53.275
Okay, Hayes, you are on bed 8.

05:53.309 --> 05:58.747
Hunt and Ka... Jo, uh,
you have AV fistula, bed 6.

05:58.782 --> 05:59.782
Take Brody with you.

05:59.849 --> 06:01.617
Wait, uh, it's Wilson now.

06:01.651 --> 06:03.552
Wait, I don't like that either.

06:03.586 --> 06:06.455
I... Okay, for now it's...
it is... it is Jo.

06:06.489 --> 06:09.925
It is Dr. Jo.

06:12.495 --> 06:14.357
How long have you had chest pain?

06:15.231 --> 06:16.598
Since I enlisted.

06:16.666 --> 06:18.600
So it's been quite some time.

06:18.635 --> 06:19.905
Lean back.

06:21.104 --> 06:22.782
Could it be anxiety?

06:23.540 --> 06:24.773
I don't know.

06:24.808 --> 06:26.575
Are my headaches anxiety, too?

06:26.643 --> 06:28.377
Back pain?

06:28.445 --> 06:29.645
Or do you think maybe it's the IED

06:29.679 --> 06:32.081
that knocked me on my skull
and killed a bunch of my buddies?

06:32.115 --> 06:33.582
I was in Afghanistan.

06:33.650 --> 06:34.836
Field surgeon.

06:36.486 --> 06:38.587
Are the cuffs really necessary?

06:38.621 --> 06:40.055
He spent a week in county for assaulting

06:40.080 --> 06:41.056
a store owner with a knife

06:41.091 --> 06:42.925
and threatening a city
block with a grenade.

06:42.959 --> 06:45.527
And still, I can't assess
him if I can't move his arm.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.602
Thank you.

06:54.671 --> 06:56.608
Why'd you assault the store owner?

06:57.307 --> 06:58.807
'Cause he deserved it.

06:58.842 --> 07:00.008
And the grenade?

07:00.043 --> 07:01.863
I felt like I deserved it.

07:03.593 --> 07:05.460
Put your arm down. Thanks.

07:05.582 --> 07:07.282
- Are you on any medication...
- Ah.

07:07.350 --> 07:09.485
...for PTSD?

07:09.519 --> 07:12.454
I was on an SSRI for a while.

07:12.522 --> 07:14.189
Helped a bit, but then
my insurance changed,

07:14.257 --> 07:16.158
and it got too expensive.

07:16.226 --> 07:17.879
I don't want any benzos.

07:18.561 --> 07:20.629
My memory's bad enough.

07:21.798 --> 07:24.967
Kyle, if you work with me,
I promise you I'll help you.

07:27.449 --> 07:29.050
Kyle?

07:30.073 --> 07:31.340
Kyle?

07:31.841 --> 07:33.976
Page Tom Koracick, please.

07:34.010 --> 07:36.011
Kyle, can you hear me?

07:36.346 --> 07:38.280
Okay, Cindy, do you
have a history of hernias

07:38.305 --> 07:39.734
in your family?

07:40.617 --> 07:42.484
That might be a good one
for you to answer, Aunt Opal.

07:42.509 --> 07:44.176
No. I don't think so.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.623
Okay, what about, uh, fevers, headaches,

07:47.657 --> 07:49.658
things like that?

07:49.692 --> 07:51.427
She's not used to meeting cute doctors.

07:51.461 --> 07:53.595
No. No fevers.

07:54.831 --> 07:58.033
Okay, well, it's likely the UTI,
along with the hernia,

07:58.067 --> 08:00.502
but I'll need a urine sample
and some other tests, okay?

08:00.527 --> 08:02.695
How long is that gonna take?

08:02.806 --> 08:04.640
It's just that I have
to arrange childcare

08:04.674 --> 08:06.842
for my other kids, so...

08:06.867 --> 08:08.968
I'll send a nurse right over.

08:10.747 --> 08:13.649
Nurse Olivia, please look at me
and act completely normal.

08:13.683 --> 08:14.683
- You got that?
- Okay.

08:14.717 --> 08:17.019
Page Chief Bailey
and get a full set of labs

08:17.053 --> 08:18.353
for the girl in bed 3.

08:18.388 --> 08:19.488
Why? What happened?

08:19.523 --> 08:20.689
She's reluctant to answer my questions.

08:20.723 --> 08:22.357
The aunt's doing all the talking for her.

08:22.392 --> 08:23.559
She fits the profile, all right?

08:23.593 --> 08:25.360
We need to keep her
here as long as possible.

08:25.428 --> 08:26.995
Profile for what?

08:27.030 --> 08:28.664
Human trafficking.

with a history of abdominal wall sarcoma.

Status post multiple surgeries...

08:46.642 --> 08:48.176
You'll forgive me if we cut right to it.

08:48.210 --> 08:49.855
I'll cut right to it, too.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.547
You really think you can fix my mom?

08:51.581 --> 08:52.681
Honey, please.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.550
Dr. Grey is an expert in this surgery.

08:54.584 --> 08:56.418
She's a pioneer in the field.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.454
A game-changer. And your
mom's extremely lucky...

08:58.488 --> 09:00.155

- You're the fourth surgeon

09:00.190 --> 09:01.523
to tell me this will be the procedure

09:01.558 --> 09:02.491
that makes my mom better.

09:02.525 --> 09:03.993
How do I know it'll
be different this time,

09:04.027 --> 09:05.361
that she won't wake up again in agony?

09:05.395 --> 09:06.462
You don't. But what I do know

09:06.496 --> 09:09.765
is where her scar tissue
starts and where it ends.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.002
And I know exactly
how I plan to remove it.

09:13.036 --> 09:14.603
And I also know that she won't have

09:14.638 --> 09:17.473
one medical bill to pay
when this is over.

09:17.507 --> 09:20.743
So, the only way all
of that can happen is...

09:20.777 --> 09:22.978
is if we get to it.

09:23.046 --> 09:24.847
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:24.915 --> 09:27.549
Dr. Grey, uh, O-OR 4 is a no-go

09:27.584 --> 09:28.594
for at least the next hour.

09:28.629 --> 09:29.652
They have the wrong instruments,

09:29.686 --> 09:31.487
and they have to
sterilize the correct ones.

09:31.521 --> 09:32.616
Why?

09:32.931 --> 09:34.490
I-I'll fix it.

09:34.557 --> 09:36.358
Well, it's, uh, 25 surgeries in 12 hours.

09:36.383 --> 09:39.218
There's, uh, bound to be
a hitch or two, right?

09:39.243 --> 09:40.977
What? Uh...

09:41.765 --> 09:44.199
Oh. Hi. Good.

09:44.234 --> 09:45.567
I told them.

09:45.602 --> 09:46.502
All parties involved.

09:46.536 --> 09:48.437
It was awkward, which...
I'm not sure why.

09:48.471 --> 09:50.615
It was all good baby-daddy news.

09:51.308 --> 09:53.175
Hello?

09:54.277 --> 09:55.310
Oh, sorry.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.578
It's just my old job with the Mariners.

09:56.613 --> 09:57.613
They've been kinda courting me,

09:57.647 --> 09:59.648
trying to get me back
while we were going through

09:59.683 --> 10:01.209
our whole...

10:01.618 --> 10:02.551
Baby-daddy drama.

10:02.585 --> 10:04.286
You know, I'd really
love it if you didn't say

10:04.354 --> 10:05.487
"baby daddy."

10:05.522 --> 10:06.855
Sorry. Dad. You're the baby dad.

10:06.890 --> 10:08.524
Baby daddy. Uh, uh, sorry.

10:08.558 --> 10:10.359
Said it again.

10:10.393 --> 10:13.495
Anyway, um, I'm saying no,
so you don't have to worry.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.031
I just need like two minutes.

10:16.066 --> 10:17.266
Do you want to say no?

10:17.300 --> 10:18.434
Well, I mean, it's a kick-ass gig,

10:18.468 --> 10:20.936
and, uh, they're offering
me basically double

10:20.971 --> 10:22.438
what they were paying
me before, but it's...

10:22.472 --> 10:24.740
it's a lot of travel,
a lot of late nights.

10:24.774 --> 10:28.544
And you're giving up
this kick-ass gig why?

10:32.074 --> 10:33.741
'Cause I'm about to be a baby daddy.

10:33.776 --> 10:35.610
<i>Dr. Bormann to Pediatrics.</i>

10:35.744 --> 10:37.345
<i>Dr. Bormann to Pediatrics.</i>

10:38.948 --> 10:41.249
Okay, Cindy, do you have
any brothers or sister?

10:42.218 --> 10:43.218
Just my cousins.

10:43.252 --> 10:45.587
Is this gonna help you
figure out what she's got?

10:45.621 --> 10:46.955
It's just a little doctor trick.

10:46.989 --> 10:48.423
You know, hospitals can be intimidating,

10:48.457 --> 10:50.391
so we make small talk as a distraction.

10:50.459 --> 10:52.677
Just helps everybody relax.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.881
Can I go to the bathroom?

10:54.916 --> 10:56.131
Nurse Olivia can take you to the bathroom

10:56.165 --> 10:57.699
- in a wheelchair.
- Oh, no, I can help her.

10:57.733 --> 10:59.434
Nurse Olivia will take her.
You can wait here.

10:59.468 --> 11:00.568
Uh, Nurse Olivia, would you mind helping

11:00.603 --> 11:01.936
Cindy to the bathroom?

11:01.971 --> 11:03.571
Thank you so much.

11:05.441 --> 11:06.708
Where the hell is Bailey?

11:06.742 --> 11:07.809
She's heading into surgery.

11:07.843 --> 11:09.577
Well, tell her she can't.
I need her here right now.

11:09.645 --> 11:10.945
You want me to tell the chief of surgery

11:10.980 --> 11:12.480
that she can't go into s...

11:12.515 --> 11:15.416
I have a human-trafficking
victim, Olivia.

11:15.451 --> 11:17.452
Dr. DeLuca, I understand
that you're concerned,

11:17.520 --> 11:19.154
but teenagers are moody.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.155
Maybe the kid is just...

11:20.189 --> 11:21.523
I know what I saw, okay?

11:21.557 --> 11:22.790
And I'm the only thing
standing between her

11:22.825 --> 11:23.658
and freedom right now.

11:23.692 --> 11:24.788
So just... You know what? Forget it.

11:24.823 --> 11:27.095
I'll do it. Just take
her to the bathroom.

11:27.163 --> 11:29.230
- Dr. DeLuca.
- Please. Please.

11:29.298 --> 11:30.965
Please.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.669
Nico and I are going to
this new speakeasy after work.

11:34.703 --> 11:36.404
You enter through a back... old room

11:36.438 --> 11:37.805
in the back of this old motel.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.940
Want to come?

11:38.974 --> 11:40.542
Uh, watching my friend
fawn over a guy who doesn't

11:40.609 --> 11:42.443
treat him as an equal
because the sex is good

11:42.511 --> 11:44.212
is not my idea of fun.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.014
Even when there's alcohol.

11:46.048 --> 11:48.616
Okay, it is so much more
complicated than that.

11:48.651 --> 11:50.184
Hey, thank you so much.

11:50.219 --> 11:51.819
Let me know when they
schedule your interview,

11:51.854 --> 11:53.367
- and I can prep you.
- Dr. Lincoln,

11:53.392 --> 11:54.923
Mr. Mendoza is on his way to the OR

11:54.957 --> 11:56.858
for his arthroscopic meniscectomy.

11:56.892 --> 11:57.886
On my way.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.794
- Thanks again, man.
- You deserve it.

12:00.229 --> 12:01.796
Deserve what?

12:01.830 --> 12:04.866
He's recommending me for
his old job with the Mariners.

12:04.900 --> 12:05.851
Wow!

12:05.886 --> 12:07.802
Are you... W-Will you... Is it...

12:07.870 --> 12:08.970
Uh, should we talk this through?

12:09.004 --> 12:11.139
I mean, uh, what kind of job is it?

12:11.173 --> 12:14.275
A job I take unless I'm
an idiot, which I'm not.

12:14.343 --> 12:15.543
Helm, where am I going?

12:15.578 --> 12:17.545
Uh, rotator cuff repair on Mrs. Lefevre.

12:17.580 --> 12:18.446
OR 3.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.280
Got it.

12:19.315 --> 12:21.115
I take it back.

12:21.183 --> 12:22.650
You're totally equals.

12:27.856 --> 12:29.891
Teddy, you paged?

12:29.959 --> 12:33.294
Oh. I paged Koracick.

12:33.329 --> 12:34.729
Do people really prefer him?

12:34.763 --> 12:37.465
Because that concerns
me on multiple levels.

12:37.499 --> 12:39.200
Sorry. Thank you for coming.

12:39.268 --> 12:41.236
36-year-old male. He's a Marine.

12:41.270 --> 12:44.906
He has severe PTSD and a probable TBI.

12:44.940 --> 12:48.042
He held an entire store
hostage with a grenade

12:48.077 --> 12:49.677
trying to blow himself up.

12:49.745 --> 12:50.851
And the VA's slammed,

12:50.885 --> 12:53.014
so he's hardly had any proper care.

12:53.082 --> 12:54.549
Well, of course not.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.017
And I noticed strange
involuntary movements

12:56.085 --> 12:59.354
and intermittent loss of awareness.

12:59.388 --> 13:03.591
I'm thinking maybe
a complex partial seizure?

13:03.626 --> 13:05.893
Okay. Okay, I will look for
signs of traumatic brain in...

13:05.928 --> 13:07.195
No! No! No!

13:07.263 --> 13:09.029
- Kyle, please!
- Ashley, leave!

13:09.097 --> 13:10.832
I didn't ask you guys to call anyone!

13:10.866 --> 13:12.367
Kyle, it's police protocol

13:12.401 --> 13:13.935
to notify your emergency contacts.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.536
I want her to go away.

13:15.571 --> 13:17.672
I don't want her to
see me like this, please.

13:17.706 --> 13:19.107
- Hey.
- No, hey, hey, no, no!

13:19.141 --> 13:20.308
No, I... Hey, I'm sorry.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.247
- He didn't mean to...
- I'm sorry.

13:21.281 --> 13:22.434
He can't breathe! Let go of him!

13:22.468 --> 13:25.680
Let go of him. He has broken
ribs and a brain injury.

13:25.714 --> 13:27.849
All right.

13:27.883 --> 13:29.417
You can give him pain meds for the ribs,

13:29.451 --> 13:30.551
but he's coming back to county.

13:30.586 --> 13:32.253
He'll go when I say he'll go.

13:40.132 --> 13:41.253
Bailey. Finally.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.955
Look, the patient won't talk to me alone,

13:43.980 --> 13:45.614
and her aunt... if she's even her aunt...

13:45.649 --> 13:46.649
won't let her out of her sight.

13:46.683 --> 13:47.783
She's answering all of her
questions for her.

13:47.817 --> 13:50.052
Bailey, the girl in there,
the... the patient, she's...

13:50.086 --> 13:51.287
DeLuca, you assured me
that you were ready

13:51.321 --> 13:53.489
to return to work, and I trusted you.

13:53.556 --> 13:55.758
Please, do not make me reconsider.

13:55.792 --> 13:57.926
I have serious reason
to believe that that girl...

13:57.994 --> 13:59.261
I know you think you know something,

13:59.296 --> 14:02.464
but I am telling you
to stop, take a breath.

14:02.499 --> 14:04.410
- I'm telling you...
- Listen to yourself.

14:05.368 --> 14:06.502
What, is that the family

14:06.536 --> 14:07.803
that you suspect of human trafficking?

14:07.871 --> 14:08.771
Bailey, trust me.

14:08.805 --> 14:10.039
If you just go in there and talk to her,

14:10.106 --> 14:11.140
you'll know, okay?

14:11.174 --> 14:12.794
Shh, shh, shh! Stay right here.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.363
Hello. Hi.

14:18.398 --> 14:20.683
I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey, Chief of Surgery.

14:20.717 --> 14:23.319
Chief? Oh, wow.
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

14:23.353 --> 14:25.888
I'm Opal. This is my niece, Cindy.

14:25.922 --> 14:28.223
Cindy! Now, how old are you?

14:28.291 --> 14:30.059
It's okay. She's the chief of surgery.

14:30.093 --> 14:31.360
You can trust her.

14:31.394 --> 14:32.494
16.

14:32.529 --> 14:33.729
And you're from the area?

14:33.763 --> 14:36.065
Not originally, but she's...
she's been here since she was 5.

14:36.132 --> 14:36.965
Hmm.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.501
Yeah, and you live with your Aunt Opal?

14:46.076 --> 14:47.843
Sorry. Um, my belly really hurts.

14:47.911 --> 14:51.413
Well, we will make you
feel better real soon, okay?

14:51.448 --> 14:52.948
Thanks.

14:57.754 --> 14:58.654
And...?

14:58.688 --> 15:00.923
That is a minor in pain
that you are keeping

15:00.957 --> 15:02.691
from getting the care that she needs.

15:02.759 --> 15:04.526
Page another resident
to take care of her.

15:04.561 --> 15:05.861
She is no longer your patient.

15:05.895 --> 15:08.297
- Bailey, stop.
- Unless you'd rather I suspend you?

15:08.331 --> 15:10.432
DeLuca, go home. Rest.

15:11.501 --> 15:14.269
And be in my office tomorrow,
9:00 a.m. sharp.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.846
Why isn't Shara in surgery right now?

15:23.913 --> 15:25.781
Bailey's patient got taken to the OR,

15:25.815 --> 15:27.583
and she got paged away urgently.

15:27.617 --> 15:28.951
Someone needs to take over.

15:28.985 --> 15:30.753
Dr. Grey! How much longer?!

15:30.787 --> 15:32.454
All my mom does is wait!

15:32.489 --> 15:34.256
And she's gonna have to wait
a little while longer.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.290
I'm sorry.

15:35.358 --> 15:37.659
We're doing everything we can.

15:41.164 --> 15:43.399
Hey, hey. Big day. Whatcha got?

15:43.466 --> 15:44.900
Nothing.

15:46.970 --> 15:48.904
- Oh. Hunt.
- Hey.

15:48.972 --> 15:51.407
I have got an extra ticket
to the big game tonight.

15:51.441 --> 15:52.648
I don't know if you've got plans,

15:52.683 --> 15:54.376
but this is gonna be
an amazing game, all right?

15:54.411 --> 15:55.577
Mavis is on fire.

15:55.612 --> 15:57.146
Hmm. Well, maybe.

15:57.180 --> 15:58.580
Yeah. Yeah.

15:58.648 --> 16:00.883
Uh, I mean, I kinda
would need a firm yes or no

16:00.950 --> 16:02.338
just so I don't waste the ticket, but...

16:02.372 --> 16:03.585
- Oh, well...
- Yeah.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.320
...then, uh, no.

16:11.227 --> 16:12.761
How about you? You like hoops?

16:12.796 --> 16:14.430
Yes! Yeah!

16:14.464 --> 16:15.998
Mm-hmm? And, um, not being invited

16:16.065 --> 16:18.467
to things as an afterthought.

16:18.535 --> 16:19.935
That's not... So that's...

16:19.969 --> 16:21.136
No.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.506
Why don't you just go alone?

16:24.541 --> 16:26.508
Oh. I'm sorry. I...

16:26.543 --> 16:29.711
I forgot. You can't do alone.

16:31.147 --> 16:32.714
Um...

16:34.017 --> 16:36.118
- Hey.
- How are you?

16:36.152 --> 16:38.153
Good. Yeah, hi.

16:38.188 --> 16:40.789
Yeah, I-I can't do it.

16:44.260 --> 16:48.330
The headaches, on a scale
of 1 to 10, how bad?

16:48.398 --> 16:50.466
53.

16:50.533 --> 16:51.900
Yikes.

16:51.935 --> 16:54.102
And you said your memory's bad?

16:54.137 --> 16:55.737
Short-term, yeah.

16:55.772 --> 16:57.706
Which is why I don't like taking meds.

16:57.740 --> 17:00.175
I end up taking them too many times a day

17:00.210 --> 17:01.210
'cause I forgot I already took them.

17:01.244 --> 17:03.512
You know they have
little pill boxes for that.

17:03.546 --> 17:05.214
I keep forgetting to buy one of those.

17:05.248 --> 17:09.285
So, sense of humor's still intact.

17:09.519 --> 17:11.513
It's buried in there somewhere.

17:13.089 --> 17:16.157
You know what you saw earlier,
how I sort of lost it?

17:16.226 --> 17:17.561
That's every day.

17:18.127 --> 17:20.897
At the gas station, over breakfast.

17:22.232 --> 17:23.898
That's why I've been avoiding Ashley.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.701
She doesn't deserve that.

17:25.734 --> 17:27.402
Neither do you.

17:36.312 --> 17:38.416
Afghanistan, and then Iraq.

17:39.282 --> 17:40.683
And when he came home,

17:40.717 --> 17:45.187
it was like he wasn't Kyle.

17:47.223 --> 17:49.858
He used to be this hilarious, silly guy.

17:51.194 --> 17:53.595
Sometimes at the grocery store,

17:53.630 --> 17:56.517
he would sing to whatever
oldies music they were playing.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.569
He would just dance
to "Brown Eyed Girl"

18:00.603 --> 18:02.607
in the cereal aisle.

18:03.273 --> 18:04.940
Everybody loved it.

18:08.611 --> 18:11.073
You know, he was someone
I wanted to be around...

18:12.108 --> 18:15.177
for the rest of my life
because I knew I'd be laughing.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.590
And I know he's sick,

18:21.624 --> 18:23.725
but he's not keeping up
with his meds, and...

18:26.095 --> 18:28.897
...I just don't know how long
I can keep doing this.

18:28.932 --> 18:30.866
And that's okay.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.035
The life that you signed up for, it's...

18:34.938 --> 18:36.772
...it's changed.

18:36.806 --> 18:39.274
And you're allowed to
have your feelings, and...

18:40.389 --> 18:42.144
...you're allowed to have your doubts

18:42.178 --> 18:44.012
and to make mistakes.

18:44.981 --> 18:47.026
I just feel like

18:48.017 --> 18:49.618
if I can't make this work...

18:51.454 --> 18:53.188
...what was it all for?

18:56.159 --> 18:59.061
We're gonna do an MRI and an EEG,

18:59.128 --> 19:00.829
and then we will know more.

19:00.863 --> 19:03.332
Ashley, we are going to help him.

19:03.399 --> 19:05.267
Thank you.

19:05.301 --> 19:06.602
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:08.204 --> 19:09.972
- Okay.
- Thank you.

19:21.051 --> 19:24.319
So, Nico said that you
used to be a team doctor?

19:24.387 --> 19:25.821
For three years.

19:25.855 --> 19:28.957
Here, take this grasper
and lift that out gently.

19:34.397 --> 19:36.431
A job like that... lotta time away?

19:36.466 --> 19:38.033
About half the year.

19:38.101 --> 19:39.134
That's why I turned it down.

19:39.168 --> 19:41.269
Why, is that something
you want to pursue?

19:41.304 --> 19:45.707
No, no, but Nico sure does.

19:48.411 --> 19:49.978
Yeah, I mean, it's a crazy schedule,

19:50.013 --> 19:52.614
but it doesn't have to be a dealbreaker.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.615
And the only reason I turned it down

19:53.650 --> 19:55.183
is 'cause I'm gonna be a dad.

19:56.420 --> 19:59.788
So, you sacrificed the job
for the person you love.

19:59.822 --> 20:01.323
Relationships are give-and-take,

20:01.357 --> 20:02.571
but I'm not really an expert.

20:02.605 --> 20:05.527
What I can tell you is
not saying how I feel

20:05.561 --> 20:07.295
has never gotten me anything.

20:12.902 --> 20:15.971
Okay, exciting news, everyone!

20:16.305 --> 20:18.340
Have you heard of
Dr. Meredith Grey, Cindy?

20:18.408 --> 20:19.975
Grey, as in G-Grey...

20:20.009 --> 20:21.143
Yeah, bingo. That's the one.

20:21.177 --> 20:23.245
Well, she's a very lovely lady
and a dear friend of mine.

20:23.279 --> 20:24.880
And today, she's giving
away free surgeries

20:24.914 --> 20:25.781
to anybody who needs them.

20:25.815 --> 20:27.182
So you two are in luck.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.316
For free? That's impossible.

20:28.351 --> 20:30.385
Normally, yes, but we've got
a remarkable set of donors

20:30.420 --> 20:31.887
here at the hospital,
and there's actually

20:31.921 --> 20:33.206
an opening in an hour.

20:33.240 --> 20:34.592
I can prep Cindy right
now and take her up.

20:34.627 --> 20:36.091
That's amazing. Honey, you hear that?

20:36.159 --> 20:38.060
They're gonna fix you up.
Okay, let's... let's go.

20:38.127 --> 20:39.995
So, unfortunately, guardians aren't

20:40.029 --> 20:41.196
allowed past the sterile line.

20:41.230 --> 20:43.265
It's just hospital protocol, right?

20:43.332 --> 20:45.801
But we can escort you
up to the surgical floor,

20:45.835 --> 20:47.569
and we can update you every half an hour.

20:47.603 --> 20:49.471
Okay, well, thank you, Dr. DeLuca.

20:49.505 --> 20:50.739
No problem.

20:50.773 --> 20:52.374
All right, take her up
to the surgical floor.

20:52.408 --> 20:53.675
Grey's operating, all right?

20:53.743 --> 20:55.777
What?! Grey's schedule is packed!

20:55.812 --> 20:57.312
I don't care. I'll do it
myself if I have to, okay?

20:57.346 --> 20:58.551
Bring her up.

21:03.819 --> 21:05.416
Should be a straightforward resection.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.974
She hasn't had any
recent flare-ups, so...

21:07.008 --> 21:09.076
So, get in, get out. Easy.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.311
Yeah.

21:12.013 --> 21:13.352
Hey, Jo...

21:13.420 --> 21:14.815
No. Stop.

21:15.228 --> 21:16.495
I can tell from the way
your voice changed

21:16.530 --> 21:18.030
that you're about to
say that you're sorry

21:18.065 --> 21:19.765
to hear about Alex,
and I would very much like

21:19.833 --> 21:23.202
to not talk about that
while I'm in my happy place.

21:23.236 --> 21:25.671
So thank you, but no.

21:25.706 --> 21:26.772
Got it.

21:28.575 --> 21:30.676
But, you know,
if you ever need a friend...

21:30.744 --> 21:32.111
...and Teddy is great with...

21:32.145 --> 21:34.246
y'know... so, if you
ever want company or...

21:34.281 --> 21:36.082
- Hunt!
- Shutting up.

21:39.986 --> 21:42.521
Hey. Um, your, uh, surgery's in OR 4.

21:42.556 --> 21:44.824
No, our patient's on the table.

21:46.860 --> 21:49.462
Oops. Uh, y-your patient is in OR 2 now,

21:49.529 --> 21:51.397
as soon as Pierce
finishes her fibroelastoma.

21:51.431 --> 21:52.398
"Oops"?

21:52.432 --> 21:53.866
Uh, you said you wanted
to shift things around.

21:53.900 --> 21:54.900
I never said that.

21:54.935 --> 21:56.335
But Dr. DeLuca said you did.

21:56.369 --> 21:57.403
Dr. DeLuca said I did?

21:57.471 --> 21:58.595
Well, we can't move.

21:58.629 --> 22:00.039
Our patient's already anesthetized.

22:00.107 --> 22:01.340
Yeah, I know!

22:01.374 --> 22:03.242
Can we use OR 3?

22:03.276 --> 22:04.710
Uh, still occupied.

22:04.745 --> 22:06.245
Ruptured pseudoaneurysm.

22:06.279 --> 22:09.348
Tell DeLuca to stay out of my schedule,

22:09.373 --> 22:12.008
and also tell him to stay off my floor.

22:16.656 --> 22:18.257
Altman. Hey.

22:18.291 --> 22:20.493
I didn't see you on Grey's schedule.

22:20.527 --> 22:22.461
Do you hate the needy?

22:22.496 --> 22:24.764
I knew you were just
in this for the cash.

22:25.369 --> 22:27.333
Y-You're not laughing
at my very funny jokes.

22:27.367 --> 22:29.702
Is everything okay?

22:39.813 --> 22:41.680
It's not Owen's baby.

22:43.650 --> 22:46.018
Oh.

22:46.052 --> 22:47.353
Yeah.

22:49.289 --> 22:52.858
Tom, this doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

22:52.926 --> 22:53.959
Hmm...

22:53.994 --> 22:55.694
But...

23:02.269 --> 23:04.103
My patient's MRI results are back.

23:04.137 --> 23:06.939
Well, don't... don't
let me, uh, keep you.

23:16.383 --> 23:18.172
Hey, you know, Cindy...

23:19.419 --> 23:21.086
is there something bothering you?

23:21.121 --> 23:23.656
Because i-if there is,
if there's something wrong,

23:23.690 --> 23:25.191
I just, uh... I want you
to know that you can

23:25.225 --> 23:26.492
talk to me about it, okay?

23:26.526 --> 23:28.594
I-I want to keep you safe.

23:30.797 --> 23:32.698
There's nothing wrong. I just...

23:32.732 --> 23:35.147
I want this to be over
with so I can go home.

23:36.403 --> 23:39.605
Okay. Right. I-I'll be right back, okay?

23:39.639 --> 23:40.906
Hey, Helm.

23:40.974 --> 23:42.374
No. Walk away, DeLuca,

23:42.409 --> 23:44.143
or I'm taking out your appendix.

23:44.211 --> 23:45.077
That's not a very nice way to speak to

23:45.111 --> 23:46.245
your chief resident. Please.

23:46.279 --> 23:49.949
You are barely hanging on
to that title, and after today,

23:50.016 --> 23:52.318
you'll be falling from it, to your death.

23:52.352 --> 23:54.286
Look, I may have bent
the truth slightly, all right?

23:54.354 --> 23:55.688
No, no, no, no, no, you lied to me,

23:55.722 --> 23:56.856
and you got me in trouble with Grey.

23:56.923 --> 23:58.624
And that is worse than lying.

23:58.658 --> 24:00.860
That is treason.

24:00.894 --> 24:02.561
And your patient is not getting surgery.

24:02.596 --> 24:04.063
So go away.

24:04.131 --> 24:05.397
<i>Dr. Perone to 4 West.</i>

24:05.532 --> 24:07.099
<i>Dr. Perone to 4 West.</i>

24:07.167 --> 24:09.835
Excuse me, could you tell
me where to find the...?

24:09.903 --> 24:11.503
- Are they ready?
- Uh, yeah.

24:11.538 --> 24:12.805
You know, we just need to take you to

24:12.839 --> 24:14.373
the pre-op area right now.

24:14.407 --> 24:16.642
This way? Thank you.

24:21.248 --> 24:22.715
Hey.

24:22.782 --> 24:23.849
Anything?

24:23.884 --> 24:27.219
Kyle has focal areas of
gliosis on his frontal lobe.

24:27.254 --> 24:28.687
The EEG confirms a seizure focus.

24:28.755 --> 24:30.556
So it's potentially fixable.

24:32.025 --> 24:34.660
Kyle and Ashley will be so relieved.

24:34.728 --> 24:35.628
I mean, his girlfriend,

24:35.662 --> 24:38.430
she has given up so much for him.

24:39.799 --> 24:42.501
Is that all love is? Just sacrifice?

24:42.535 --> 24:44.870
You... You meet someone you
want to be with, you have kids,

24:44.905 --> 24:49.408
and then, poof, goodbye,
dreams, wishes, desires?

24:49.442 --> 24:51.377
Yes.

24:51.411 --> 24:54.546
I gave up my apartment,
my job, my universal healthcare,

24:54.614 --> 24:56.749
my European work visa, and for what?

24:56.783 --> 24:58.450
For...

24:58.485 --> 25:00.441
For a marriage that might work?

25:01.054 --> 25:03.355
Teddy, Link's the father.

25:03.390 --> 25:04.490
And even if it was Owen's...

25:04.524 --> 25:05.591
Please, stop.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.360
Are you seriously mad
at me for a hypothetical?

25:08.395 --> 25:10.262
Hypotheticals have consequences, too.

25:10.297 --> 25:12.264
We need to update Kyle.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.268
- I was told three hours ago!
- My mom was promised

25:16.303 --> 25:17.603
two hours ago that she would get a bed!

25:17.637 --> 25:19.271
Everyone, please lower your voices!

25:19.306 --> 25:20.339
- We can't wait.
- Things went a little

25:20.373 --> 25:21.440
- off the rails, huh?
- We've been doing this all day.

25:21.474 --> 25:22.841
It's not my fault!

25:22.876 --> 25:24.744
- I need to talk to you.
- Dr. Grey, my mom hasn't

25:24.778 --> 25:25.970
eaten in 24 hours.

25:26.005 --> 25:27.279
Neither have I.

25:27.314 --> 25:28.580
Get... Get a handle
on your operation, Grey.

25:28.615 --> 25:29.949
These people are about to riot.

25:29.983 --> 25:31.450
Please, I just need a little more time.

25:31.484 --> 25:32.442
I know you said you
were gonna cut it off...

25:32.476 --> 25:33.619
Whatever. Don't care. Just finish.

25:33.653 --> 25:35.654
I'll pay for the OT.

25:35.689 --> 25:37.289
Griffin Ford gave us
enough money to cover

25:37.357 --> 25:39.158
pro bono days a couple
of times a year if we want.

25:39.192 --> 25:40.459
I-I was gonna put in a chiefs' lounge

25:40.527 --> 25:42.061
with a steam room, you know, but, uh...

25:42.095 --> 25:43.295
Why'd he give you so much money?

25:44.497 --> 25:49.034
Anterior cerebral artery
aneurysm is what the news said.

25:50.270 --> 25:51.870
Wow. I knew you were dirty.

25:51.905 --> 25:53.295
I didn't know you were that dirty.

25:53.330 --> 25:54.540
You're the one who
told me to trust my gut

25:54.565 --> 25:55.933
and try to fix the world.

25:56.009 --> 25:57.543
Not like that!

25:57.577 --> 26:00.145
You want to cancel your little
charity day on principle?

26:00.180 --> 26:01.847
Be my guest.

26:01.881 --> 26:03.082
I didn't think so.

26:03.584 --> 26:05.484
<i>Code violet, OR waiting room.</i>

26:05.519 --> 26:06.885
What is that?

26:06.920 --> 26:08.420
<i>- Code violet, OR waiting room.</i>
- What's code violet?

26:08.488 --> 26:09.455
It means somebody's getting violent

26:09.522 --> 26:10.522
with hospital staff.

26:10.557 --> 26:11.790
Hey, hey! Stay back!
Don't you come near her!

26:11.825 --> 26:13.125
You cannot do this!

26:13.159 --> 26:14.159
Hey! Stay away!

26:14.227 --> 26:15.294
Stop! Stop!

26:15.328 --> 26:16.795
Don't move! Okay? Hey!

26:16.830 --> 26:18.564
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:18.598 --> 26:19.709
- Dr. DeLuca.
- It's okay... I got you.

26:19.743 --> 26:21.266
- Dr. DeLuca.
- It's okay... I got you.

26:21.301 --> 26:22.550
Hey, hey! Security?

26:22.584 --> 26:24.636
Arrest this woman for child trafficking!

26:25.939 --> 26:27.639
No! Someone help me!

26:27.707 --> 26:29.174
Security, you heard me!

26:29.242 --> 26:30.976
You have to let her go!

26:37.615 --> 26:39.515
That is my niece!

26:39.546 --> 26:41.556
Stop! Stop! Don't move!

26:41.581 --> 26:43.048
Security, detain her right now!

26:43.082 --> 26:45.417
No, no, no, no one's gonna detain anyone.

26:45.451 --> 26:46.918
Uh... We're all just gonna back up.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.053
Just stay calm, DeLuca.

26:48.087 --> 26:50.388
Andrea, please, please,
please, stop this, please.

26:50.423 --> 26:52.424
- This man is crazy!
- I'm not crazy!

26:52.458 --> 26:53.725
You're hurting her!

26:53.760 --> 26:55.193
All right, everybody,
you know what to do.

26:55.261 --> 26:56.495
Dangerous person in the hospital, okay?

26:56.529 --> 26:58.930
We need to join hands,
form a human chain around her, okay?

26:58.965 --> 27:00.198
Let's go. Come on.

27:00.233 --> 27:01.566
Everybody, come on.

27:01.601 --> 27:02.701
Come on!

27:02.769 --> 27:04.436
What are you waiting for?!

27:04.470 --> 27:06.437
Huh? Come on! Let's do it!

27:07.106 --> 27:09.608
Mer!

27:09.675 --> 27:12.611
Yes! Yes! Finally! Come on!

27:12.645 --> 27:14.446
Let's go.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.414
Get around her, guys. Okay.

27:16.449 --> 27:17.616
What?

27:17.650 --> 27:18.784
Don't let her... What?

27:18.818 --> 27:20.252
What are you doing? Huh?

27:20.286 --> 27:21.386
What are you doing?

27:21.454 --> 27:23.221
No, no, no, no, no, no! What? Hey!

27:23.256 --> 27:25.557
Bailey? Mer, come on.

27:25.625 --> 27:26.758
- Security.
- No, no, no, no, no.

27:26.826 --> 27:27.759
This is not okay.

27:27.794 --> 27:29.394
Please escort
Dr. DeLuca to my office.

27:29.462 --> 27:30.362
Stop. What? Me?!

27:30.396 --> 27:32.097
Wh... What, you're just gonna let her go?

27:32.131 --> 27:33.262
Oh, my gosh...

27:33.296 --> 27:35.100
Okay, open your eyes, people, okay?!

27:35.134 --> 27:37.402
She's selling human beings!

27:37.470 --> 27:39.638
Look at her! She's afraid!

27:39.705 --> 27:42.007
That's not love.
That's a trauma bond, okay?

27:42.041 --> 27:44.242
She's threatening her
or... or her family.

27:44.277 --> 27:46.162
I-I know it, okay?

27:46.196 --> 27:47.546
She's... She's torturing her!

27:47.580 --> 27:48.580
She's selling her!

27:48.614 --> 27:50.415
Bailey, stop this, please!

27:50.449 --> 27:53.451
If you ever want to step
foot in my hospital again,

27:53.486 --> 27:56.988
go with security to my office.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.645
- No.
- Andrea, please.

27:59.680 --> 28:00.959
We need to save her!

28:00.993 --> 28:02.661
It's okay, Andrew.

28:02.695 --> 28:05.397
It's okay.

28:05.431 --> 28:06.965
It's okay.

28:09.535 --> 28:10.669
Stop it.

28:12.638 --> 28:14.773
Andrea, please, please, please.

28:18.578 --> 28:20.478
You're all blind.

28:20.513 --> 28:22.781
All of you.

28:27.820 --> 28:29.721
Don't touch me!

28:29.755 --> 28:30.955
It's okay. It's okay.

28:33.692 --> 28:34.993
<i>Code violet, canceled.</i>

28:35.127 --> 28:36.328
<i>Code violet, canceled.</i>

28:36.362 --> 28:38.163
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:39.732 --> 28:42.033
I was wondering, uh, if we
should skip the bar tonight.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.736
Maybe go somewhere
without as many windows?

28:44.770 --> 28:47.572
I need somewhere with windows

28:47.607 --> 28:49.708
because every time I try to
talk to you about something,

28:49.775 --> 28:51.209
you distract me.

28:51.244 --> 28:53.545
Great. What now?

28:53.613 --> 28:55.313
"What now"?

28:55.348 --> 28:57.115
That's your response
to me wanting to talk?

28:57.149 --> 28:58.550
Well, yeah, because
it's usually something

28:58.584 --> 28:59.584
you're pissed about.

28:59.619 --> 29:02.821
I'm not pissed, but...

29:02.855 --> 29:06.358
I-If you get that job,
it's going to affect us.

29:06.392 --> 29:08.193
I think that at least
warrants a conversation.

29:08.227 --> 29:09.661
It hasn't even happened yet.

29:09.695 --> 29:11.296
A-And what if it does?

29:11.364 --> 29:12.564
What? What?

29:12.632 --> 29:13.999
So you want me to feel bad about it?

29:14.033 --> 29:15.467
It's my dream job, Levi.

29:15.534 --> 29:19.738
Nico, a relationship requires
sacrifice and compromise.

29:19.805 --> 29:22.874
And I'm the only one who
ever does either of those.

29:22.909 --> 29:24.743
Your way always goes,

29:24.777 --> 29:27.332
and I'm tired of telling
you that I want more.

29:28.281 --> 29:29.714
All right.

29:29.749 --> 29:30.882
"All right," what?

29:30.917 --> 29:32.170
All right, I...

29:34.720 --> 29:37.217
I hope you find someone
who will give that to you.

29:53.205 --> 29:55.307
I hope everyone's all right.

29:55.341 --> 29:58.043
I can't imagine what else
could go wrong today.

29:58.077 --> 29:59.411
Well, you know the old joke.

29:59.445 --> 30:00.946
How do you get God to laugh?

30:00.980 --> 30:03.048
Make a plan.

30:03.416 --> 30:06.184
Your kids, uh, need
a sitter when you go out,

30:06.218 --> 30:07.319
or are they old enough
to stay home alone?

30:07.353 --> 30:09.721
As long as I leave enough
pizza money, they're grand.

30:09.755 --> 30:11.589
Well, I'm asking 'cause
I got amazing tickets

30:11.624 --> 30:12.845
to the game tonight.

30:12.879 --> 30:15.126
A friend bailed on me last minute, so...

30:16.295 --> 30:17.562
American football.

30:17.630 --> 30:19.197
Don't even get me started.

30:19.231 --> 30:20.732
Don't even know how you call it a sport.

30:20.766 --> 30:21.967
I mean, they blow the
whistle and they run for,

30:22.001 --> 30:23.301
what, 30 seconds?

30:23.336 --> 30:25.704
In real football... soccer...

30:25.771 --> 30:27.906
it's 45 minutes a half,
90 minutes end-to-end.

30:27.940 --> 30:31.242
That's real athleticism, non-stop.

30:31.310 --> 30:32.577
Well, my father-in-law used to force me

30:32.645 --> 30:33.847
to watch the American football.

30:33.881 --> 30:35.213
I just... I couldn't get into it, man.

30:35.247 --> 30:37.958
Used to kind of annoy me
a little bit, to be honest.

30:37.992 --> 30:39.451
So many ads.

30:39.485 --> 30:43.922
It's a basketball game tonight,
so, a little different.

30:43.956 --> 30:45.290
Yeah.

30:45.324 --> 30:46.591
Not really my thing, either, mate.

30:46.625 --> 30:48.259
Thanks anyway.

30:52.798 --> 30:54.099
DeLuca!

30:54.133 --> 30:55.408
Hey, what are you doing?

30:55.443 --> 30:56.668
Looking for a new job. I quit.

30:56.702 --> 30:57.728
I tried.

30:57.762 --> 30:59.571
He needs help, but he won't listen!

31:00.706 --> 31:02.240
Okay, Andrew, look at me, please.

31:02.274 --> 31:03.327
No. No.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.509
Please.

31:04.543 --> 31:05.977
Since day one, all I ever wanted

31:06.045 --> 31:07.846
was to be like you, like all of you.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.581
You know,
just a-accomplish the impossible,

31:09.615 --> 31:11.850
make a difference i-in people's lives.

31:11.884 --> 31:13.485
And the more I do that,

31:13.552 --> 31:16.287
the more you all just
judge me and call me crazy,

31:16.322 --> 31:17.374
and I'm not!

31:17.408 --> 31:18.957
And I'm sick of it, and I'm done!

31:19.025 --> 31:20.825
But you are accomplishing the impossible,

31:20.893 --> 31:22.527
and that's why I can't let you quit.

31:22.595 --> 31:23.995
I'm not your business anymore, Meredith!

31:24.030 --> 31:25.530
I don't work for you,
and I don't love you!

31:25.598 --> 31:27.499
But I love you.

31:30.703 --> 31:31.736
I love you.

31:31.771 --> 31:34.506
You went to jail for me.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.876
You saved me from myself.

31:37.910 --> 31:40.712
I cannot let you walk away from this.

31:41.174 --> 31:43.681
Just take some time, take the suspension,

31:43.716 --> 31:46.484
but come on, this is not how this ends.

31:49.422 --> 31:50.889
If you tell Bailey to call

31:50.923 --> 31:52.557
the national trafficking hotline

31:52.591 --> 31:54.688
and investigate that girl...

31:57.232 --> 31:58.942
I'll take the suspension.

31:59.665 --> 32:01.066
Done.

32:11.910 --> 32:13.427
How is DeLuca, is everything okay?

32:13.452 --> 32:15.485
No. How are we? What's happening?

32:15.519 --> 32:16.553
Uh, Mrs. Freeman still hasn't...

32:16.587 --> 32:19.156
Hey, Mer, this Marine Corps
vet served in two wars.

32:19.190 --> 32:20.436
If we kick him back to the VA,

32:20.470 --> 32:22.525
God knows how long it's gonna take.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.132
Uh, y-y-y-yes, he can have a spot, yes.

32:25.156 --> 32:27.457
Whoa, wait! You can't
just give a spot away!

32:27.491 --> 32:29.626
We've been waiting.
My mom has been waiting!

32:29.660 --> 32:31.761
I know how long she has been waiting.

32:31.795 --> 32:33.296
I have been here all day myself.

32:33.330 --> 32:35.098
It's not fair! It's wrong!

32:35.132 --> 32:36.499
You know...

32:36.533 --> 32:37.433
Is that what's happening
now... you're giving spots away?

32:37.468 --> 32:40.503
I know you want to help a lot of people,

32:40.571 --> 32:43.062
but my mom should be one of them.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.065
She's in agony.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.310
You said you'd help her.

32:50.986 --> 32:52.720
You should not have to apologize

32:52.788 --> 32:54.955
for being such a good advocate.

32:54.990 --> 32:58.092
I am sorry that the
system is this messed up

32:58.126 --> 32:59.961
that you have to fight this hard.

33:00.295 --> 33:03.297
Your mom is going to get her surgery.

33:03.331 --> 33:04.549
I promise.

33:05.267 --> 33:07.368
Your Marine is going to get his surgery.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.596
You're all gonna get your surgeries.

33:10.839 --> 33:12.907
Because we have a very generous donor

33:12.975 --> 33:16.944
who has graciously agreed
to extend Pro Bono Surgery Day

33:16.979 --> 33:18.546
for as long as we need.

33:19.782 --> 33:21.349
And I'm very happy to announce

33:21.417 --> 33:24.485
that we are going to start
doing Pro Bono Surgery Days

33:24.519 --> 33:26.587
once a month here from now on.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.900
Legend.

33:47.096 --> 33:49.009
We have good news.

33:49.044 --> 33:50.644
We found a seizure focus,

33:50.679 --> 33:53.091
probably due to your traumatic injury,

33:53.126 --> 33:55.449
and we have a plan to cure your seizures.

33:56.151 --> 33:57.996
Will that make his other
symptoms go away?

33:58.030 --> 34:00.255
It will definitely make him
feel more like himself.

34:00.322 --> 34:01.989
And we can testify in court

34:02.023 --> 34:04.325
that this condition caused your behavior.

34:05.527 --> 34:08.062
Thank you. So much.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.297
How many years until the
VA can fit me in, though?

34:11.333 --> 34:12.666
They're not doing it. I am.

34:12.701 --> 34:14.068
I got you into the pro bono surgeries

34:14.101 --> 34:15.835
that are happening as we speak.

34:15.904 --> 34:17.605
Wait. What?

34:17.639 --> 34:20.375
You are done waiting, Kyle.

34:22.677 --> 34:24.011
No.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.393
- I love you.
- I love you.

34:46.101 --> 34:48.068
What did you say to that doctor?

34:48.103 --> 34:49.603
- Nothing.
- Yeah, well, I'm not stupid.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.239
- I know you said something.
- I didn't, I swear.

34:52.274 --> 34:53.574
My stomach really hurts.

34:53.608 --> 34:56.043
It was your own fault, so stop crying.

35:09.957 --> 35:13.192
Hey. You feel like Richard's doing okay?

35:13.428 --> 35:15.563
Um, considering that
your mother's lawyers

35:15.597 --> 35:18.099
are going after him in the separation,

35:18.166 --> 35:20.034
I would say he's fair.

35:20.068 --> 35:22.536
He hasn't said a word
to me since the merger.

35:22.571 --> 35:24.105
I guess that's why.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.942
You know he stepped down
from surgery, right?

35:27.967 --> 35:29.535
What? No.

35:29.644 --> 35:31.946
- Why?
- Innovation.

35:31.980 --> 35:33.280
Depression.

35:33.315 --> 35:35.382
We've tried to talk
him out of it, but, uh,

35:35.417 --> 35:36.917
you know how he can stonewall.

35:36.942 --> 35:38.244
Damn.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.734
The last thing I wanted
was to take sides in all this.

35:41.759 --> 35:42.759
I...

35:42.784 --> 35:43.751
Does he know that?

35:43.776 --> 35:45.310
I thought it was obvious.

35:45.594 --> 35:47.545
Oh, there he is.

35:47.929 --> 35:49.463
Richard?

35:49.497 --> 35:51.298
You got any plans tonight?

35:51.333 --> 35:53.267
Did Catherine send you to spy on me?

35:53.301 --> 35:54.802
Why would you say that, Richard?

35:54.836 --> 35:56.930
Would you put it past her?

35:57.264 --> 35:59.799
Okay, fair enough,
but the answer's no, okay?

35:59.824 --> 36:02.292
I just have an extra ticket
to the game tonight,

36:02.444 --> 36:04.111
which doesn't make you an afterthought.

36:04.145 --> 36:05.746
Uh, I guess technically it does.

36:05.781 --> 36:08.358
I was going with Vic,
but that's over now, so...

36:08.724 --> 36:10.491
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

36:10.516 --> 36:11.950
Thanks. Anyway, I don't know if you've

36:11.975 --> 36:13.141
been following the season, but Mavis...

36:13.166 --> 36:14.333
Are you kidding?

36:14.358 --> 36:16.159
Mavis has been on fire!

36:16.184 --> 36:17.685
Did you see that 3-pointer last week?

36:17.710 --> 36:20.312
- At the buzzer?!
- Ohh!

36:20.337 --> 36:21.938
So, that's a yes, then, or what?

36:21.963 --> 36:23.306
A hell-to-the-yes!

36:23.331 --> 36:25.298
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.219
Who'd you kill?

36:37.078 --> 36:38.646
I think I dumped myself.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.381
Is that even possible?

36:40.415 --> 36:41.615
Oh, wait. Of course it is.

36:41.650 --> 36:43.184
I'm me.

36:43.919 --> 36:45.786
I left all my stuff at Nico's place

36:45.821 --> 36:48.322
because he convinced me to
move out of my mom's house.

36:48.356 --> 36:49.523
And I haven't found an apartment yet.

36:49.591 --> 36:51.659
So I'm homeless!

36:51.793 --> 36:55.562
Do you want to stay with me
while you look for a place?

36:55.597 --> 36:58.132
Jo, that time in my mom's
basement was a one-time thing.

36:58.166 --> 36:59.099
I'm a gay man.

37:03.204 --> 37:06.473
That's why you're
getting the invite, dummy!

37:06.508 --> 37:08.042
Oh.

37:08.067 --> 37:10.369
My place is too empty, and I'm too sad,

37:10.394 --> 37:12.195
and I don't want to be
chased out of the place

37:12.220 --> 37:14.021
I bought for myself because my husband...

37:14.046 --> 37:18.049
because my ex-hus... I just...
I don't want to have to go.

37:18.186 --> 37:21.722
But it needs to change. Like, now.

37:21.756 --> 37:23.724
Then definitely yes.

37:23.758 --> 37:25.359
We can be super sad together.

37:30.398 --> 37:31.865
Let's get him up to post-op.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.678
You know, I've slept with a lot of women.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.105
All sizes, creeds, and colors,

37:54.130 --> 37:55.831
and I've slept with women
whose language I speak

37:55.856 --> 37:56.812
and whose language I don't,

37:56.858 --> 37:58.225
women who just left their husbands,

37:58.260 --> 37:59.760
even women who just left their wives.

37:59.785 --> 38:01.319
You know, I don't discriminate,

38:01.344 --> 38:03.312
but believe it or not, I have a code.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.726
It's a rather, you know, bespoke...

38:07.388 --> 38:09.354
code, but still, it's a...

38:11.106 --> 38:13.169
I draw the line at married women.

38:13.194 --> 38:14.361
Right.

38:14.386 --> 38:15.520
And you're about to be one.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.578
Y-You have the heirloom ring.

38:17.612 --> 38:19.613
You have the two kids.
You might as well have a dog.

38:22.793 --> 38:24.494
I may not care for Agent Orange,

38:24.519 --> 38:26.954
but I've been the husband whose
wife sleeps with another man,

38:26.979 --> 38:28.998
and I-I'll never be that guy.

38:36.073 --> 38:38.308
I love you, and I want
to make this easy for you.

38:38.342 --> 38:40.643
So go home, Teddy.

38:40.678 --> 38:43.947
Plan your wedding.
Spend time with your fiancé.

38:44.014 --> 38:45.515
I'll be just fine.

38:58.562 --> 39:00.296
Mm.

39:07.071 --> 39:10.215
You know, we could make this work.

39:11.275 --> 39:13.376
We did make it work.

39:13.410 --> 39:16.012
No, I mean your dream job.

39:16.046 --> 39:18.481
You... You said it...
it has too much travel,

39:18.515 --> 39:20.216
but you love travel.

39:21.352 --> 39:23.086
But now there are new things in my life

39:23.120 --> 39:24.554
that I love more.

39:26.214 --> 39:28.182
I guess.

39:28.207 --> 39:30.208
It's just scary that from now on,

39:30.233 --> 39:33.435
every want and need and desire

39:33.460 --> 39:35.929
is gonna be put on hold for our kid.

39:38.802 --> 39:41.112
Promise me we'll always
fight for our dreams.

39:42.506 --> 39:44.324
I will always fight.

39:45.242 --> 39:46.826
I may not win.

39:47.611 --> 39:50.455
Maybe you should take that job.

39:51.615 --> 39:55.284
There are 81 away games a year.

39:55.752 --> 39:58.354
Okay, but the next dream.

40:02.593 --> 40:04.894
<i>It's been said that
you haven't lived today</i>

40:04.928 --> 40:07.030
<i>unless you have done
something for someone</i>

40:07.064 --> 40:08.965
<i>who can never repay you.</i>

40:11.835 --> 40:13.870
<i>But that's easier said than done.</i>

40:13.904 --> 40:17.106
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

40:19.134 --> 40:21.544
I, um...

40:27.117 --> 40:28.451
Owen, I...

40:30.154 --> 40:31.554
What?

40:31.622 --> 40:33.256
I ju... I, um...

40:33.290 --> 40:34.891
I had a really...

40:37.628 --> 40:39.362
I had a really rough patient.

40:40.564 --> 40:42.465
A vet.

40:42.499 --> 40:45.001
War was hell... home was hell.

40:45.035 --> 40:47.970
He's just been through so much.

40:49.673 --> 40:51.407
Yeah.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.185
I'm sure you helped him.

40:55.379 --> 40:57.146
Come here.

41:07.591 --> 41:09.325
<i>Because when your life's a mess,</i>

41:09.359 --> 41:11.378
<i>it's hard to be much help to anyone else.</i>

41:11.412 --> 41:12.662
Hey.

41:12.696 --> 41:14.530
I called the trafficking hotline.

41:14.565 --> 41:17.533
They told me not to
scare the suspect away.

41:17.568 --> 41:19.002
But they're gone.

41:19.670 --> 41:20.937
DeLuca.

41:20.971 --> 41:22.605
What if he was right?

41:32.121 --> 41:33.783
Tea?

41:33.817 --> 41:34.926
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

41:36.687 --> 41:37.887
Well, you did it.

41:39.192 --> 41:41.557
Yeah, I single-handedly
saved American medicine.

41:41.592 --> 41:43.659
<i>I wish I had something
more encouraging to say.</i>

41:43.727 --> 41:44.994
I see it now.

41:45.028 --> 41:46.529
The twisted-ness.

41:46.563 --> 41:48.406
Took you long enough.

41:49.399 --> 41:51.367
Thanks for your help today.

41:52.302 --> 41:53.836
<i>And if that sounds too hard...</i>

42:12.756 --> 42:15.391
<i>...well, this might
not be the life for you.</i>
