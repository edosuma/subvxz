WEBVTT

00:36.703 --> 00:38.538
Honey, you want some dinner?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.876
-Oh, you're having dinner.

00:43.960 --> 00:44.961
Where's your brother?

00:47.505 --> 00:49.132
Skittles, it's dinnertime.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.472
-Skittles!

00:55.555 --> 00:57.432
-Where'd you get to?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.976
-Skittles!

01:00.060 --> 01:01.603
-Where are you?

01:01.686 --> 01:03.938
-You in these trees?

01:05.023 --> 01:07.233
-Your brother's already had his dinner.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.573
What the…

01:17.410 --> 01:19.162
<i>-Uh…</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:41.559
Oh!

01:42.143 --> 01:43.144
Oh.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.562
That was weird.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.661
Oops, no country. No country.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.874
No country.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.376
-Ow!

02:06.459 --> 02:07.961
Oof. Dang it.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.923
It's better, though.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.532
-Three greens in a row. Must be my day.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.871
You're on the phone!
Get off your phone!

02:42.954 --> 02:44.622
You're not that interesting.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.251
-Thanks, man.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.254
-Hey.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.047
-Hey, Bob.
-Looking good.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.757
-Yeah, I know.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.301
-Come on.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.104
-Oh, hi, Amily.
-Hi, Amily.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.856
I don't have time for light chitchat.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.900
Connie, Jenna, can you get out, please?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.443
Get, go, go, go, come on.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.278
Get out, get out, get out, get out.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.322
-Eff off. Respectfully.
-That's a bit rude.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.825
Okay, I have something to tell you
and it is hella important.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.702
Okay, no one says "hella" anymore.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.454
Yes, they do, Tom! All the time.

03:24.537 --> 03:25.997
I'm not sure they do, Amily.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.082
Like they don't change
the first letter of their name

03:28.166 --> 03:30.210
from an E to an A
to sound more interesting.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.963
It's based on a French movie
about a French woman named Amélie

03:34.047 --> 03:37.258
who gets bangs cut,
so if you haven't heard of it…

03:37.342 --> 03:38.509
Was it any good?

03:38.593 --> 03:41.012
I haven't actually seen it,
but I heard it's amazing.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.889
It-- That's not what we're talking about.

03:42.972 --> 03:46.935
The point I'm trying to make is that
I saw something crazy last night.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.563
And I do wanna just
be completely open and honest.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.440
I just wanna preface
the whole thing by saying,

03:52.523 --> 03:54.400
yes, I did cocaine twice last week,

03:54.484 --> 03:57.946
but I did zero cocaine preceding
the event I'm about to describe.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.948
-Jesus.
-I also, uh…

04:00.031 --> 04:03.159
accidentally roofied myself last night,
but I don't know if that's relevant.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.161
How do you accidentally roofie yourself?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.414
It's a lot easier than you'd think.
I was at a restaurant.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.001
I'm sitting at the bar, scrolling
my live panda feed from China that I love,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.170
and I see this guy,
and he's looking at me,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.005
and I'm like, "He likes what he sees."

04:16.089 --> 04:19.384
Go in my pocket, pull out a mint.
Popped a mint. It's not a mint.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.845
It's a beta blocker. So I wash that down
with four… to six tequilas

04:22.929 --> 04:25.473
and then I try to order some food
to right the ship.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.141
This restaurant does not serve food.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.102
-Were you at a bar?
-I was at a bar.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.604
So I'm at this restaurant
that really is a bar,

04:31.688 --> 04:35.191
and I realize, "Oh my God, I don't have
my purse. I've left it at work."

04:35.275 --> 04:37.902
I'm gonna stop right there.
I wanna stay in integrity.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.113
I did cocaine three times last week.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.950
Okay, look. You gotta cut to the chase.
Also, tell the truth the first time.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.452
How about this?
Why don't you tell your face

04:46.536 --> 04:48.204
to tell your face the truth
the first time?

04:48.288 --> 04:52.250
Or tell that 'stache to tell the rest
of your face the truth the first time.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.294
My 'stache, which doesn't have a mouth,

04:54.377 --> 04:57.088
it's on top of my mouth,
it's gonna tell my face the truth?

04:57.171 --> 04:58.423
-What you doing?
-You got burned.

04:58.506 --> 05:01.009
-You think that's a burn?
-Oh, I'm looking at scorched earth.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.011
-So…
-Are you? Because I'm quite comfortable.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.555
That was a pretty good burn.
I'd give that a solid six.

05:05.638 --> 05:09.767
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Anyway, shut up. Doesn't matter.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.185
I came in here, work,

05:11.269 --> 05:13.771
late last night and went to grab my purse.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.863
<i>Clark is sitting</i>
<i>at his desk, where he always is.</i>

05:21.946 --> 05:23.364
<i>Except he's glowing.</i>

05:23.906 --> 05:25.533
<i>Glowing?</i>
<i>What do you mean, glowing?</i>

05:25.616 --> 05:27.660
He was… glowing. He was…

05:27.744 --> 05:29.787
He was actually, literally glowing.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.499
Like… from the inside.
You know, this bright but soothing light.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.251
Holy shit.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.672
Clark was glowing.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.307
Just the one beta blocker, then?

05:51.142 --> 05:53.436
Guys, he was glowing, okay?

05:53.519 --> 05:54.937
I mean, he was like a little bug,

05:55.021 --> 05:57.774
or one of those
deep, deep sea creatures that glow.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.193
You-- Wendy, you know
what I'm talking about.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.527
Why would I know?

06:01.611 --> 06:05.114
Because… The big squids that aren't
really the big squids but they glow.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.116
I'm assuming Australia has them.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.577
I wouldn't know,
because I'm not from Australia.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.288
I'm from New Zealand,
which I've told you numerous times.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.957
It's a moot point,
because I'm not buying any of this.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.043
You told us you roofied yourself.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.836
You didn't drive afterwards, did you?

06:18.920 --> 06:23.299
No, but I did… ride my scooter here.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.676
-Amily, you can't do that.
-Oh-- Yeah. Don't do that.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.137
-For your safety, for everyone's.
-Yes. For everyone's safety.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.180
-Yeah.
-What Mohsin said.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.348
-You cannot drive home.
-No.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.225
-Wendy's right on the money.
-Thank you.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.395
Okay, I'm just gonna come out and say it.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.689
Your story is a big ol' nothin' burger

06:38.773 --> 06:41.275
on a nothin' bun,
served with a side of nothin'

06:41.359 --> 06:43.111
next to a tall glass

06:43.194 --> 06:45.405
of frosty whatever.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.199
You're a pile of shit, Tom.

06:48.282 --> 06:51.953
Look, guys, Clark's our friend,
okay, and he's the sweetest, and, ugh.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.080
I don't--
I'm not comfortable talking about him.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.541
-It doesn't matter, it's not true!
-It is true.

06:56.624 --> 06:59.794
If you want us to believe
something this crazy is true, prove it.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.130
How am I supposed to prove that, Tom?

07:02.213 --> 07:03.923
I don't know. Just ask him if he glows.

07:04.006 --> 07:07.385
I can't just ask him.
What if I spook him and he, you know,

07:07.468 --> 07:10.221
goes underground
or, like, you know, hides?

07:10.805 --> 07:13.850
Where's he gonna hide?
You know what? I'm gonna ask him.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.059
-You are not.
-I'm gonna.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.020
-No, you're not! I will end you so hard.
-Okay.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.772
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.191
-Look at me. Look at me!
-Yes. Copy, copy, copy!

07:22.692 --> 07:23.943
-Look at me more!
-More?

07:24.026 --> 07:25.069
-More!
-Yes, good.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.657
Clark could be my Sasquatch.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.618
Okay? And that would
make me, then, Indiana Jones.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.329
And that's probably
the one shot I got at it, so…

07:35.413 --> 07:39.667
I don't know how or why he glowed,
but I know that he glowed, okay?

07:39.750 --> 07:44.380
Maybe he's an alien.
Maybe he grew up next to the… the…

07:44.464 --> 07:46.674
-Power lines.
-Power lines. Thank you.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.927
Hell, maybe it's biblical. I don't know.
Is Sasquatch part of the Bible?

07:50.511 --> 07:51.679
I don't know. I'm Muslim.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.764
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

07:53.848 --> 07:55.391
-Oh!
-How you doin'?

08:00.855 --> 08:03.274
Well, quieter vibes today.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.693
Did I do something weird?
Did I bring in a weird energy?

08:05.776 --> 08:07.153
No, no, \you're fine.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.531
Oh, okay. Cool. Uh, it's--

08:17.079 --> 08:19.832
Reverse surprise
'cause it's not your birthday!

08:23.294 --> 08:26.422
I just don't think
that what you're saying is true

08:26.506 --> 08:28.299
or that it actually happened, okay?

08:28.382 --> 08:30.426
Not because you're a liar.
That's not what I'm saying.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.679
It's just, you do
take a lot of recreational drugs.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.890
Do you remember that time last year

08:35.973 --> 08:39.560
when you took three Tylenol PMs
for your headache at lunch,

08:39.644 --> 08:42.855
and then you thought
you saw a bobcat in the bathroom?

08:42.939 --> 08:46.859
Yeah, I do, and in my defense,
I thought I was taking three Vicodin.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.320
So it's not apples to opioids.

08:49.403 --> 08:53.449
But-- And I-- I still do think I saw
some kind of fur in the other stall.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.453
You need to stop taking drugs, okay?
And Clark doesn't glow.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.622
Something up with Clark?
What's up?

08:59.705 --> 09:01.624
There is nothing up with Clark.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.627
Tom, stop eavesdropping
on my private conversation

09:04.710 --> 09:07.171
or I will shave that 'stache
and put it somewhere else.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.423
-That's not even a good threat.
-It's a great threat.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.511
Okay, I don't like to pull rank, but
I can't have you threatening each other.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.597
He's not threatening me, Frisbee.
I'm threatening him.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.598
Frisbee, she wishes.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.643
Okay, love it if you guys
stopped calling me Frisbee.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.145
-But that's your name.
-It is <i>not</i> my name.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.314
In fact, it's nobody's name. No one…

09:25.398 --> 09:27.775
No one on Earth is named Frisbee.
So no more Frisbee.

09:27.858 --> 09:31.153
It's your name here.
I have to call you Frisbee 'cause you look

09:31.237 --> 09:34.282
exactly like all those other white guys
that wear the…

09:34.365 --> 09:36.492
What are the longer shorts
with all the pockets?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.662
-Cargo shorts.
-Ha-ha! Cargo shorts.

09:39.745 --> 09:43.082
And then the Tevas,
and, like, the Tommy Bahama linen shirts,

09:43.165 --> 09:47.044
and you throw your disc
in a grassy public area.

09:47.128 --> 09:47.962
Frisbee golf?

09:48.045 --> 09:50.464
-Yeah. That's why you call him Frisbee.
-Ah.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.091
-Because of Frisbee golf.
-Yeah.

09:52.174 --> 09:56.012
So that's why I have to call you Frisbee,
because of that.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.139
So take care. That's all.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.891
Okay, quick reminder.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.227
Uh, I am your direct supervisor,

10:03.311 --> 10:05.896
and I need you guys
to kind of buckle down--

10:08.232 --> 10:09.442
Tell me that's not alcohol?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.320
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

10:15.531 --> 10:19.994
Just, let's all… Let's do what we can…
Let's get to work. Good job.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.372
-Hi, Frisbee.
-How you doin', Clark?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.500
On the move. On the move.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.886
-Uh… Okay. Thank you.
-Yeah. You're gonna need it.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.597
-Everything okay, guys?
-Good. Great.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.182
-Yeah, good.
-Good.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.059
Yeah.

10:44.977 --> 10:45.811
'Kay.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.197
Don't take this the wrong way.
I'm saying this from deep affection,

10:56.280 --> 10:59.408
but you are acting crazier than normal,
which is very crazy.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.328
Well, I'm deeply offended
that you don't believe me.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.580
I can't. It's just too nutty.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.916
Remember last summer
when you took a bunch of Adderall

11:06.999 --> 11:09.085
with margaritas,
and thought you met Oliver Twist?

11:09.168 --> 11:10.127
No.

11:10.211 --> 11:14.048
The whole point of taking Adderall
and margaritas is so you don't remember.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.469
Good point. But look, if you ever
really wanted to prove Clark was glowing,

11:18.552 --> 11:20.346
you'd need to make him glow again.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.598
Sort of jar it out of him somehow.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.102
-You can't just make people glow.
-Mm, because people don't glow, Am.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.563
-What?
-Uh, Am. Am.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.607
-I don't like when you shorten my name.
-Yeah.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.943
-It's weird.
-I'm sor-- Oh, there he is. Uh--

11:34.026 --> 11:36.112
-Don't say anything.
-I won't. Sh, sh, sh.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.363
-Don't!
-Ahem!

11:39.949 --> 11:41.617
-Hey. Hi.
-Hey!

11:41.701 --> 11:44.537
-Mohsin, how are ya?
-Good. What's, uh… what's going on?

11:44.620 --> 11:47.957
-Oh, just makin' some copies, old school.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.001
Do you need copies made,
or do you need to use the copier?

11:51.085 --> 11:53.087
-No, no. I'm fine, you know.
-You're good?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.756
-Oh, that. Yeah. Love that.
-All good.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.179
What the heck, Mohsin?

12:04.807 --> 12:08.644
I think it's tetherball, but really
this is Tom's one and only ball.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.733
You've gotta stop pining over her, Clark.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.737
-I don't think I'm pining.
-Yeah, you are. You're pining.

12:20.364 --> 12:23.117
Oh, gosh. Just look at her, though, huh?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.076
-Clark.
-What?

12:24.160 --> 12:28.164
You had your chance, okay?
And you missed your chance. You blew it.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.707
Yep, I did.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.792
You should've
asked her out years ago.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.043
I know.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.839
I think about that night
all the time.

12:36.922 --> 12:40.092
-Stick a fork in me. I am done.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.803
-See ya, Frisbee. Have a good night.
-See ya, guys.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.848
I wouldn't even hesitate
to stick a fork in him.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.186
Looks like it's just us.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.190
Have a lovely evening.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.988
Okay, look, Clark, we can't
go through the story again, okay?

13:01.530 --> 13:04.408
I'm not, I… wasn't planning
on going through the entire story.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.869
-Yes, you were.
-Yeah, I sure was.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.413
Are you okay?

13:11.248 --> 13:12.666
Oh my gosh. Stay still. Don't move.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.336
-Frisbee.
-Huh?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.379
Stop twiddling with the blinds.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.507
Uh-- Th-- Okay.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.946
-Hey, man.
-Oh. Hey, you know, Tom, um…

13:42.029 --> 13:44.490
I'm wondering if we could
maybe not have a talk right now.

13:44.573 --> 13:49.745
'Cause mostly I try to pretend that these
moments in my life, um… never happen.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.707
And, uh, I would like to not share them
with anyone at all.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.376
Uh, not even with you, Tom.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.087
Look, man, I know what you're gettin' at,
but people poo.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.672
We're all gonna have to get over it.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.216
That's a fair point. I guess
we're having a conversation now,

14:02.299 --> 14:05.678
so, uh, why don't we get to it
so we can get through it?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.805
Uh, what's goin' on?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.099
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.893
See, I'm gonna need you
to settle an argument.

14:12.977 --> 14:16.772
Someone's been goin' around
spreadin' some bullshit that,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.649
I don't know, maybe you glow?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.693
What? Glow? What do you mean?

14:20.776 --> 14:22.987
Glow. You know, like glowing.

14:23.487 --> 14:24.655
So, what is it?

14:25.155 --> 14:27.366
Do you or do you not… glow,

14:27.449 --> 14:31.537
with, like, an orangish-yellow light
that comes from within?

14:31.620 --> 14:32.997
Who's saying this?

14:33.080 --> 14:37.126
Oh, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to divulge my source.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.753
-Why?
-Well, because I'm terrified of her.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.338
And she'll get mad at me.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.132
So don't say anything to her.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.427
I don't want her to know she's all up
in my mental kitchen, you know?

14:46.510 --> 14:50.014
I can't tell her, Tom, because
I don't know who you're talking about.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.683
We're getting off topic here.
Do you or do you not glow?

14:52.766 --> 14:55.227
-Not to my knowledge, no.
-Boom! See?

14:57.313 --> 15:00.441
Yeah, I knew. I knew. It's a ridiculous
question to ask. Nobody glows.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.861
Phew! That's a load off.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.865
-Oh, and a word of advice?

15:07.948 --> 15:10.826
Don't take too long in there, man.
Just…

15:10.910 --> 15:11.785
Get after it.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.747
Let's never do this again.
Thank you! Goodbye!

15:19.043 --> 15:19.877
Hi!

15:19.960 --> 15:21.170
Hey, Clark.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.090
Are you, uh… just digging into
a sad little box of lettuce?

15:25.174 --> 15:28.636
Oh, I don't know. There's some fun stuff
in here. There's, like, a crouton.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.431
-I think there was a raisin in here.
-Ooh, a singular raisin.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.142
-Yeah, he didn't last long. I found him.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.729
So, uh… how you feelin', Clark?

15:38.812 --> 15:40.189
You're feelin' okay?

15:40.272 --> 15:43.192
Funny you should mention that.
Everyone's mentioning that today.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.196
You know, Tom just asked me
in the bathroom if I glowed.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.657
What? That… fucker.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.992
-What?
-Just, you said Tom and…

15:52.660 --> 15:56.205
If I think about Tom, I just think,
"Boy, he's a real fucker."

15:56.288 --> 15:59.708
Oh, I kind of think he's more
of a diamond in the rough type of guy,

15:59.792 --> 16:02.753
but, uh… it's funny
everyone's mentioning that today.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.297
I wonder… I have been feeling
a little bit off.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.677
You know, uh… 'Cause--
Only 'cause you brought it up, I was…

16:10.719 --> 16:15.975
I was gonna say that I-- I did stop in,
uh, kind of late a few nights ago,

16:16.058 --> 16:17.434
into the office, and, uh…

16:18.686 --> 16:20.854
you-- you did look different.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.314
-Like how so?
-Uh…

16:22.398 --> 16:24.024
I would say… lighter

16:24.775 --> 16:25.609
would be…

16:26.276 --> 16:28.070
-Lighter would be the…
-Oh.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.407
-When you passed out on your scooter?
-Yeah. That.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.118
Oh, my gosh.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.370
Amily?

16:40.833 --> 16:44.837
You know, anyway, I'm glad
you kinda stopped in, in the break room.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.881
I had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.883
-Oh?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.469
-Do you hear Harry Styles' song?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.013
Because I'm hearing Harry Styles.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.556
Yes, because it's playing.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.683
-Of course I do.
-How is it on?

16:57.766 --> 17:01.145
Tom's probably tinkering around
with his stupid…  Alexa.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.646
Oh, but doesn't…  Alexa…

17:02.730 --> 17:04.356
have to play what you ask it to play?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.359
Yeah, but Tom programmed it, so God knows.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.777
Alexa, stop.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.198
-Alexa, stop.
-Alexa, stop.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.039
Tom probably programmed it to respond
to some other name or something.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.291
I didn't know you could do that.
Why would he do that?

17:22.374 --> 17:23.834
Because Tom's a big idiot.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.294
Fuck off, Amily.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.589
Stop listening to other people's
conversations, you little prick!

17:28.672 --> 17:31.341
I'd love it if you two would stop
screaming obscenities at each other.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.636
Frisbee, look directly at Tom
and tell him to fuck off.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.181
No, I'm not-- I'm not gonna do that.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.724
Yes. Don't walk away!

17:38.807 --> 17:41.310
I am late for a budget call.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.771
That's a lie. That's not true!

17:43.854 --> 17:48.776
God, he runs like a giant toddler.
Why doesn't he move his arms?

17:48.859 --> 17:50.152
I don't know.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.653
Um…

17:51.737 --> 17:56.533
You know, this is probably
not a good time, but I just wanted to--

17:56.617 --> 18:00.746
-I cannot hear a word you're saying.
-Oh. I was trying to keep my volume low

18:00.829 --> 18:03.624
because other people were hearing
and…  Alexa's listening.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.335
Your volume was internal.
It was not audible.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.463
Got it. This is more of a personal,
um… thing.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.424
I just was wondering,
um, if you'd like to go out sometime?

18:13.008 --> 18:15.135
But with-- but with me, though? Um… I--

18:15.219 --> 18:17.763
I ask because I think you're really nice,
and you're, um…

18:17.846 --> 18:19.515
you're very… you're very lovely,

18:19.598 --> 18:21.892
um, and you're-- you're very bold.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.186
And also, in a non-harassment way,

18:24.269 --> 18:27.523
in the workplace, I wanted just to say
that I think you're not ugly.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.150
-Oh.
-Phew. In an attractiveness way.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.528
Ooh, that's not it. That is not it.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.072
You basically just called me a dude.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.156
And an ugly dude.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.117
Perhaps we could imagine
I'm doing this better.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.036
Could we pretend, perhaps,
that I'm a Brad Pitt? I don't know him.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.706
I should call him Bradley Pitt.
Could we pretend I'm Bradley Pitt

18:44.790 --> 18:48.001
doing this how he would do it,
like Bradley Pitt is inside my body?

18:48.085 --> 18:49.837
Oh, that's… Okay.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.673
-Nope. No. No, Bradley--
-It's a different visual.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.883
He's not… Yeah, he's not there, and, uh…

18:54.967 --> 18:56.760
Just, let's wipe our slate clean of that.

18:56.844 --> 19:00.764
I feel that if I keep talking,
I can dig my way out of this.

19:00.848 --> 19:05.352
I don't think there's a shovel
on the planet that can facilitate

19:05.435 --> 19:06.854
the amount of digging you need.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.107
You know what this makes me think of,
or reminds me of,

19:10.190 --> 19:16.989
is kind of like… like a quiet meteor,
just kind of screaming towards the Earth.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.075
And you know it's gonna hit.
It's definite. Death is coming.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.872
But it's not gonna happen
for, like, 18 months,

19:24.955 --> 19:28.292
so just that torture is dragged out,

19:28.917 --> 19:31.295
uh, almost forever, it feels like.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.089
That's-- that's what it makes me think of.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.341
I'm so deeply sorry.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.302
So, 7:00 tonight?

19:39.428 --> 19:40.929
Oh, what? You wanna go?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.183
Yeah, sounds fun.

19:45.976 --> 19:46.810
Cool!

19:54.902 --> 19:58.655
Cheeky Clark. I can't believe
that he finally asked you out.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.367
Nobody believes I saw him glow,
but I did, and I'm gonna get some answers.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.702
Plus, he's got a great can.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.120
-Does he?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.208
Whoa, we gotta pump the brakes.
"Can," uh, is short for buttocks.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.419
And "buttocks" is not allowed.
It's inappropriate work conversation.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.047
I didn't say "buttocks."
You said "buttocks." You took it weird.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.050
-Uh, you--
-Did you tell Tom to fuck off yet?

20:18.133 --> 20:21.845
If we can't say "can,"
we can't say F-word, so no.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.514
Can you tell Tom's buttocks to fuck off?

20:24.598 --> 20:26.683
-Frisbee?
-You know what? I, uh…

20:26.767 --> 20:29.186
-I can't hear you, because I'm too far--

20:29.269 --> 20:31.063
-Oh!

20:31.146 --> 20:33.148
Oh no! Oh no!

20:33.690 --> 20:38.654
It's okay. I have… I have drop foot
'cause I have a damaged femoral tendon.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.031
I'm in physical therapy, so it's fine.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.367
-You okay, Frisbee?

20:43.450 --> 20:46.119
I don't even think it's that.
I think it's my ACL.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.248
No, no, it's my foot.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.458
Ooh, she's cramping up!

20:51.541 --> 20:52.584
Oh, my God!

20:52.668 --> 20:54.544
-What are you gonna wear?

20:54.628 --> 20:55.754
I'm gonna try a middle part.

20:55.837 --> 20:56.755
-That'll be cute.
-Yeah.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.299
-I love that for you.
-We're good. We're good.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.301
Whew! Whew!

21:03.345 --> 21:06.348
I still can't believe
you don't drink at all.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.683
Me neither.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.936
That was such a weird thing to say.
I'm sorry. I don't--

21:11.019 --> 21:13.397
That made no sense.
I think I'm just a little nervous.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.942
Anyway, I wanted
to say early, if it's okay,

21:17.025 --> 21:21.071
uh, just in case at some point in
the evening, you wanna flee or anything…

21:21.154 --> 21:23.407
-Okay.
-…that I appreciate you going out with me.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.325
I know it's not a favor,
but I'm just super--

21:25.409 --> 21:28.036
I'm super glad that you said yes
and that we're here.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.749
I like that you say shit
that should embarrass you but it doesn't.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.753
Thank you. I… You know…

21:37.587 --> 21:40.132
I think I just say what's on my mind.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.135
Maybe that's just, like,
a product of having no game.

21:43.218 --> 21:46.722
No, your game is that you have no game.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.142
Oh, thank you for that.
I'll take it. Thank you.

21:50.225 --> 21:53.520
And who knows?
I mean, maybe you did us a favor.

21:53.603 --> 21:57.733
Maybe if you had asked me out, you know,
back then and we would have gone out,

21:57.816 --> 21:58.900
it could've gone terribly.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.736
We could've been, like,
violently murdered,

22:00.819 --> 22:02.612
or stabbed, or like, you know,

22:02.696 --> 22:04.781
-drowned, like, bound, gagged…
-Whoa.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.200
Assaulted, thrown in a lake, pegged.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.871
So maybe you changed our destiny
for the better.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.789
So, I guess, thank you.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.043
Well, I'm just happy that, uh…
that didn't happen…

22:16.126 --> 22:18.462
-Yeah.
-And that we're here tonight.

22:18.545 --> 22:22.382
Hi. Do you guys have any questions at all,
or ready to order?

22:22.466 --> 22:24.468
Uh, I will have the tuna tartare,

22:24.551 --> 22:29.056
and I would love three more of the little
tiny, uh, tequila drinks, please.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.308
So three tequila shots?

22:31.391 --> 22:34.394
No. No, no, no, no. Not tequila shots.

22:34.478 --> 22:38.065
I want, um, these little drinking vessels

22:38.148 --> 22:41.485
to have tequila put inside of them,
making a tequila drink.

22:41.568 --> 22:45.280
Or if this were "Bar-thelona,"
I would thay, uh…

22:45.364 --> 22:46.531
<i>"Treth bambinoth."</i>

22:46.615 --> 22:47.616
The three babies.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.578
The three babies.
<i>Treth bambinoth, por favor-th.</i>

22:51.661 --> 22:53.538
I'll have those simultaneously.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.041
And it's fine, 'cause
I'm not on a beta blocker tonight.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.042
-Oh good.
-Yeah.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.752
-Wait, what?
-Hmm?

22:58.835 --> 23:00.962
-You ready?
-Yes, absolutely.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.173
I think I'll order the chicken,
but I have a question,

23:03.256 --> 23:07.302
which is, is it on a rotisserie overnight,
or is it just for a few hours?

23:07.386 --> 23:10.597
There's a question behind the question
before you even answer the first question.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.059
I know, I'm sorry,
but how crispy does the skin get?

23:14.142 --> 23:16.770
Because my father and I, um…

23:16.853 --> 23:20.273
we have Thursday night dinners,
and we always make, uh, chicken.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.651
And, uh, really…
Well, it's not always chicken.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.569
But the meals in between making chicken

23:24.653 --> 23:28.073
are like the meals that we're wishing
that we could have the roast chicken,

23:28.156 --> 23:30.534
'cause it's such crispy skin.
and it's so delicious.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.412
That's sort of, kinda,
the crux of what I'm getting at,

23:33.495 --> 23:36.331
'cause my Dad and I
make roast chicken all the time.

23:36.415 --> 23:40.127
What we do is we salt it, or we
air chill it, or both, and sometimes…

23:42.003 --> 23:45.549
-What's happening? Uh, hey, guys.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.803
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, everybody.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.846
I wanna apologize.

23:52.639 --> 23:57.477
I don't know why the song keeps playing.
I don't. I really don't. I'm very…

23:57.561 --> 23:59.521
I apologize. I think this is my fault.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.815
I'm really sorry, everyone.
Really sorry, Amily.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.733
-This is not my intention at all.

24:09.072 --> 24:13.577
Cool. So that… stopped. That was my bad.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.542
I knew it.
