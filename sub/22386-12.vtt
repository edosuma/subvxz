(Insects chirping)

06:10.737 --> 06:12.304
¶ Skye ¶

06:12.306 --> 06:14.940
Perfect runway, Chase, but Skye
will need to see where it is.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.575
¶ Skye ¶

06:17.578 --> 06:18.327
I'm on it!

Floodlight!

06:21.064 --> 06:21.913
¶ Skye ¶

06:25.619 --> 06:28.553
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.705
We need to light up
the runway somehow.

06:29.706 --> 06:30.856
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.175
Rocky, do you have any old
flashlights on your truck?

06:33.176 --> 06:35.493
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.178
Sure, I've got a bunch.

06:36.179 --> 06:36.861
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:36.864 --> 06:37.546
Great idea, Ryder.

06:37.547 --> 06:38.229
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:38.232 --> 06:38.814
Chase--
And Rocky--

06:38.815 --> 06:39.397
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.000
Are on the case!
Are on the case!

06:41.001 --> 06:42.601
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.285
(Barking)

06:43.286 --> 06:43.968
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.204
Tape.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.438
Great, but your light only shows
Skye where we are.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.710
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.694
Look for the runway lights.

06:52.695 --> 06:53.677
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.796
Roger that.

06:54.797 --> 06:55.913
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.482
I see the lights, Ryder!

06:57.483 --> 06:59.049
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

06:59.052 --> 06:59.718
Almost there, Ace!

06:59.719 --> 07:00.385
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:00.387 --> 07:00.836
(Popping)

07:00.837 --> 07:01.286
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.605
Oh no, I'm not going to make it!
The plane's going down too fast!

07:03.606 --> 07:05.923
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.125
I've got to jump!

07:07.126 --> 07:08.325
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:08.328 --> 07:08.744
Oh no!

07:08.745 --> 07:09.161
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:09.163 --> 07:09.828
Ryder, Ace has to parachute out.

07:09.829 --> 07:10.494
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.864
In the dark? She won't be able
to see where she's landing.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.232
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:15.235 --> 07:15.851
(Snapping fingers)

07:15.852 --> 07:16.468
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:16.470 --> 07:16.802
I know!

07:16.803 --> 07:17.135
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.804
Ace, have you ever done
any wing walking?

07:18.805 --> 07:20.472
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.390
<i> Yep, it's my favorite stunt.</i>

07:21.391 --> 07:22.307
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.909
<i> Haven't you ever seen</i>
<i> her walk and roll move?</i>

07:23.910 --> 07:25.510
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.479
Ace is the greatest wing walker
in the whole world.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.447
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:29.450 --> 07:29.949
Aww, thanks, Skye.

07:29.950 --> 07:30.449
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.518
Awesome. Skye, drop your cable
and harness from the helicopter.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.586
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.888
If Ace can get out on the wing
and attach it to herself,

07:35.889 --> 07:37.189
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:37.191 --> 07:38.624
she won't have to parachute.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.058
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:40.060 --> 07:40.559
Roger, Ryder.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.059
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:41.061 --> 07:41.593
You copy, Ace?

07:41.594 --> 07:42.126
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.328
Meet you on the wing!

07:43.329 --> 07:44.528
You should be near the farm,
Skye.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.635
Here I come.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.853
(Engine popping)

07:51.854 --> 07:53.070
Here I come.

07:53.073 --> 07:53.755
Careful.

07:53.756 --> 07:54.438
Here I come.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.674
(Grunting)

07:55.675 --> 07:56.908
Here I come.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.443
Missed it!
I'm not sure I can grab it.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.977
Here I come.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.730
I've got my parachute on!
I'm going to jump!

08:01.731 --> 08:03.481
Here I come.

08:03.484 --> 08:03.983
We can do this, Ace!

08:03.984 --> 08:04.483
Here I come.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.819
I'm going to get
as close as I can!

08:06.820 --> 08:09.154
Here I come.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.423
Got it!

08:11.424 --> 08:13.691
Here I come.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.159
I got her!

08:14.160 --> 08:14.625
Here I come.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.028
(Barking)

08:16.029 --> 08:17.429
Here I come.

08:17.431 --> 08:18.013
(Cheering)

08:18.014 --> 08:18.596
Here I come.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.732
We're waiting for you
at Yumi's farm.

08:19.733 --> 08:20.866
Here I come.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.350
<i> Almost there.</i>

08:21.351 --> 08:21.833
Here I come.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.984
Ryder, could you
check on Amelia?

08:22.985 --> 08:24.134
Here I come.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.153
Sure, but who's Amelia?

08:25.154 --> 08:26.170
Here I come.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.940
<i> My plane. Every great pilot</i>
<i> names their plane.</i>

08:27.941 --> 08:29.708
Here I come.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.692
No problem. I can track Amelia
from right here.

08:30.693 --> 08:31.675
Here I come.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.912
Ace's plane is heading for
a water landing.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.147
Here I come.

08:36.149 --> 08:36.731
Chase, let's get to the Bay

08:36.732 --> 08:37.314
Here I come.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.683
and try to get it onto the beach
before it sinks.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.050
Here I come.

08:40.053 --> 08:40.869
Chase is on the case!

08:40.870 --> 08:41.686
Here I come.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.804
<i> Marshall here. How can I help?</i>

08:42.805 --> 08:43.921
Here I come.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.190
We need you to do
a medical check on Ace

08:45.191 --> 08:46.457
Here I come.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.259
to make sure she's okay.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.059
Here I come.

08:48.061 --> 08:48.510
<i> On my way!</i>

08:48.511 --> 08:48.960
Here I come.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.562
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

08:50.563 --> 08:52.163
Here I come.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.099
(Engines revving)

08:54.100 --> 08:56.034
Here I come.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.352
(Helicopter approaching)

08:57.353 --> 08:58.669
Here I come.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.137
There's Skye!

08:59.138 --> 08:59.603
Here I come.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.840
Yeah! Woo-hoo! This is more fun
than wing walking!

09:01.841 --> 09:04.075
Here I come.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.494
Maybe I should add it
to my show.

09:05.495 --> 09:06.912
Here I come.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.863
(Grunting)

09:07.864 --> 09:08.813
Here I come.

09:08.815 --> 09:09.581
Thanks, Skye!

09:09.582 --> 09:10.348
Here I come.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.266
No problem, Ace!

09:11.267 --> 09:12.183
Here I come.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.085
I can't believe
I just rescued my hero!

09:14.086 --> 09:15.986
Here I come.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.272
Ace, are you okay?

09:17.273 --> 09:18.556
Here I come.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.291
(Siren wailing)

09:19.292 --> 09:20.024
Here I come.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.260
EMT Marshall will answer
that question.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.494
Here I come.

09:22.496 --> 09:24.446
Let me check and make sure
there aren't any broken bones.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.397
Here I come.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.199
(Barking)

09:27.200 --> 09:27.999
Here I come.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.485
X-ray screen!

09:30.486 --> 09:32.970
Here I come.

09:32.973 --> 09:33.555
So, what hurts?

09:33.556 --> 09:34.138
Here I come.

09:34.141 --> 09:34.640
Umm, nothing, really,

09:34.641 --> 09:35.140
Here I come.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.543
I just got this teeny
little scratch on my arm.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.945
Here I come.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.947
Don't you think you overdid it
just a little?

09:41.948 --> 09:43.948
Here I come.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.399
Maybe.

09:44.400 --> 09:44.848
Here I come.

09:44.851 --> 09:45.567
I feel like a Conehead.

09:45.568 --> 09:46.284
Here I come.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.569
But otherwise, I'm okay.

09:47.570 --> 09:48.853
Here I come.

09:48.855 --> 09:49.287
(Laughing)

09:49.288 --> 09:49.720
Here I come.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.206
Come on, everyone. We need to
get to the Main Street Beach.

09:51.207 --> 09:52.690
Here I come.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.943
And fast, before Amelia
sinks into the Bay!

09:54.944 --> 09:57.194
Here I come.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.630
(Engine sputtering)

09:58.631 --> 10:00.064
Here I come.

10:03.570 --> 10:04.803
Yes!

10:04.805 --> 10:06.905
All hooked up, Chase, let's get
it to the beach before it sinks.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.006
Yes!

10:09.009 --> 10:10.275
I'm on it.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.542
Yes!

10:11.545 --> 10:14.012
(Whirring)

10:14.013 --> 10:16.480
Yes!

10:16.483 --> 10:18.366
(Cheering)

10:18.367 --> 10:20.250
Yes!

10:20.253 --> 10:22.053
Amelia's in pretty rough shape.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.854
Yes!

10:23.857 --> 10:25.390
I don't think she'll be ready in
time for an air show tomorrow.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.924
Yes!

10:26.927 --> 10:28.560
That would take a whole team
of mechanics.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.194
Yes!

10:30.197 --> 10:31.113
Team Ace reporting for duty.

10:31.114 --> 10:32.030
Yes!

10:32.032 --> 10:32.514
Let's get to it!

10:32.515 --> 10:32.997
Yes!

10:33.000 --> 10:35.017
Aww, thanks, pups. But you've
helped me so much already.

10:35.018 --> 10:37.035
Yes!

10:37.037 --> 10:39.154
Whenever you need a paw,
just yelp for help.

10:39.155 --> 10:41.272
Yes!

10:41.274 --> 10:43.074
(Laughing)

10:43.075 --> 10:44.875
Yes!

10:44.878 --> 10:46.995
Nice!
Nice!

10:46.996 --> 10:49.113
Yes!

10:52.119 --> 10:54.285
(Barking)

10:54.287 --> 10:56.388
Wow, she's as good as the first
day we flew together.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.490
(Barking)

10:58.492 --> 10:59.174
Thanks, team.

10:59.175 --> 10:59.857

10:59.860 --> 11:00.993
(Barking)

11:00.994 --> 11:02.127
(Barking)

11:02.129 --> 11:02.644
It was our pleasure.

11:02.645 --> 11:03.160
(Barking)

11:03.163 --> 11:04.880
I couldn't have done it
without the PAW Patrol.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.598
(Barking)

11:06.600 --> 11:07.416
I can't wait for
the air show tomorrow.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.233
(Barking)

11:08.235 --> 11:10.118
Skye, how would you like to see
my walk and roll trick

11:10.119 --> 11:12.002
(Barking)

11:12.005 --> 11:12.904
up close and personal?

11:12.905 --> 11:13.804
(Barking)

11:13.807 --> 11:15.107
Would I?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.408
(Barking)

11:21.715 --> 11:24.883
(Gasping)

11:24.885 --> 11:25.467
Look! It's Skye!

11:25.468 --> 11:26.050
(Gasping)

11:26.053 --> 11:27.286
Wow! She's so good!

11:27.287 --> 11:28.520
(Gasping)

11:28.522 --> 11:29.488
You're all good pups.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.455

11:30.457 --> 11:32.507
Woo-hoo!

11:32.508 --> 11:34.558

11:34.561 --> 11:35.577
(Cheering)

11:35.578 --> 11:36.594
(Gasping)

11:36.596 --> 11:37.262
Way to go, Skye!

11:37.263 --> 11:37.929
(Gasping)

11:37.931 --> 11:38.380
Way to go, Ace!

11:38.381 --> 11:38.830

Chickaletta,
Ryder's right there.

12:04.006 --> 12:05.989
(Clucking)

12:05.992 --> 12:08.343
Oh, hey, Chickaletta.

12:08.344 --> 12:10.695
(Clucking)

12:10.697 --> 12:11.613
It's okay, come on.

12:11.614 --> 12:12.530
(Clucking)

12:12.532 --> 12:14.566
Oh, don't be a shy little
chicken. You can do it.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.601
(Clucking)

12:20.006 --> 12:21.873
Or not.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.158
Oh my, Chickaletta,

12:23.159 --> 12:24.442
Or not.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.478
did someone drop some corn?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.513
Or not.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.284
(Laughing)

12:33.286 --> 12:35.103
This is an invitation to
Farmer Yumi and Al's wedding?

12:35.104 --> 12:36.921
(Laughing)

12:36.923 --> 12:38.189
All of Adventure Bay
will be there.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.456
(Laughing)

12:39.459 --> 12:41.109
Could the PAW Patrol
help set up?

12:41.110 --> 12:42.760
(Laughing)

12:42.763 --> 12:43.462
Of course we will.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.162
(Laughing)

12:44.164 --> 12:45.514
I love weddings. Woo-hoo!

12:45.515 --> 12:46.865
(Laughing)

12:46.867 --> 12:48.333
And decorating! Wee!

12:48.334 --> 12:49.800
(Laughing)

12:49.803 --> 12:51.069
And dressing up! And--

12:51.070 --> 12:52.336
(Laughing)

12:52.339 --> 12:52.821
Flipping?

12:52.822 --> 12:53.304
(Laughing)

12:53.306 --> 12:54.689
Ooh, and a nice,
warm bubble bath?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.073
(Laughing)

12:56.076 --> 12:56.725
"Bath"? I'll pass.

12:56.726 --> 12:57.375
(Laughing)

12:57.377 --> 12:59.594
Rocky, the wedding treats alone
are worth getting wet.

12:59.595 --> 13:01.812
(Laughing)

13:01.815 --> 13:02.430
Marshall's right.

13:02.431 --> 13:03.046
(Laughing)

13:03.049 --> 13:04.149
But first,
there are tables to be set

13:04.150 --> 13:05.250
(Laughing)

13:05.252 --> 13:06.001
and decorations to be hung.

13:06.002 --> 13:06.751
(Laughing)

13:06.753 --> 13:08.670
No buffet is too big.
No pup is too small.

13:08.671 --> 13:10.588
(Laughing)

13:10.590 --> 13:11.940
Mmm, buffet!

13:11.941 --> 13:13.291

13:15.545 --> 13:16.795

13:16.797 --> 13:19.348
Totally on target,
table-setting champ!

13:19.349 --> 13:21.900
(Laughing)

13:21.902 --> 13:22.634
Yes!

13:22.635 --> 13:23.367

13:23.970 --> 13:24.569

Awesome!

13:32.045 --> 13:33.178
(Laughing)

13:33.180 --> 13:35.247
Pink balloon, ready to go.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.315
(Laughing)

13:37.317 --> 13:38.350
Balloon bouquet finished.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.384
(Laughing)

13:39.386 --> 13:40.068
Wings!

13:40.069 --> 13:40.751

13:54.567 --> 13:56.501

the barn's looking terrific!

14:09.282 --> 14:10.615
(Laughing)

14:10.617 --> 14:12.617
This'll be the fanciest wedding
Adventure Bay has ever seen!

14:12.618 --> 14:14.618
(Laughing)

14:14.621 --> 14:16.721
Chickaletta, I can't see!

I can't wait till tomorrow.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.413

14:48.470 --> 14:49.786
(Laughing)

14:49.789 --> 14:51.089
No, thanks,
I just took a bath last month.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.390
(Laughing)

14:52.392 --> 14:53.892
Rocky, you are kind of dusty.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.393
(Laughing)

14:55.395 --> 14:57.545
Nothing a little shake
can't fix.

What are we going to do?

15:38.371 --> 15:38.987
(Mooing)

15:38.988 --> 15:39.604
Oh no, the barn!
What are we going to do?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.089
At least the animals are safe.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.573
Oh no, the barn!
What are we going to do?

15:42.575 --> 15:43.825
We can't have a wedding
in a broken barn.

15:43.826 --> 15:45.076
Oh no, the barn!
What are we going to do?

15:45.078 --> 15:46.961
We won't have to.
I know who can help.

We'll be right there to help.

16:12.972 --> 16:13.571
(Yawning)

16:13.573 --> 16:14.956

and Farmer Yumi.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.870

the wedding decorations

17:27.147 --> 17:29.965
Maybe not. It's a big job.
But I think we can fix it.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.784
Rubble? Rubble?

17:32.786 --> 17:33.368
Rubble, I need your crane

17:33.369 --> 17:33.951
Rubble? Rubble?

and your tool arm

17:41.177 --> 17:42.160
Rubble? Rubble?

17:42.162 --> 17:44.029

17:44.030 --> 17:45.897
Rubble? Rubble?

17:45.899 --> 17:46.865
Don't lose it! Reuse it!

17:49.535 --> 17:51.235
Rubble? Rubble?

the wedding.

19:12.034 --> 19:12.983
¶ Rubble ¶

19:12.986 --> 19:13.685
I think we can fix it in time.

19:13.686 --> 19:14.385
¶ Rubble ¶

19:14.387 --> 19:16.020
Let's do it!
Let's do it!

19:16.021 --> 19:17.654
¶ Rubble ¶

19:17.657 --> 19:19.274
(Barking)

19:19.275 --> 19:20.892
¶ Rubble ¶

19:20.894 --> 19:22.761
Just set it down here, Rocky,
thanks.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.629
¶ Rubble ¶

19:24.631 --> 19:25.430

19:25.431 --> 19:26.230
¶ Rubble ¶

19:26.232 --> 19:28.383
(Beeping)

19:28.384 --> 19:30.535
¶ Rubble ¶

19:31.938 --> 19:33.337
How am I going to get up there?

19:33.339 --> 19:34.439
I'll give you a lift, buddy.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.540
How am I going to get up there?

19:35.542 --> 19:36.408
Whoa!

19:36.409 --> 19:37.275
How am I going to get up there?

19:37.277 --> 19:38.276
(Barking)

19:38.277 --> 19:39.276
How am I going to get up there?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.245
Screwdriver.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.212
How am I going to get up there?

19:45.418 --> 19:49.453

¶

19:52.241 --> 19:55.026
(Barking)

19:55.028 --> 19:56.094
That's all the shingles
rounded up.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.161
(Barking)

19:57.163 --> 19:57.595
(Squealing)

19:57.596 --> 19:58.028
(Barking)

19:58.031 --> 20:00.565
Huh? Aww, look how cute Emma
and Corny are together.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.100
(Barking)

20:03.102 --> 20:04.552
Okay, everybody,
ready to lift that wall?

20:04.553 --> 20:06.003
(Barking)

20:06.005 --> 20:07.205
Yeah!
Yes!

20:07.206 --> 20:08.406
(Barking)

20:10.009 --> 20:12.810
Hit it, Rubble.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.444
(Barking)

20:13.445 --> 20:14.077
Hit it, Rubble.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.113
Here we go!

20:15.114 --> 20:16.147
Hit it, Rubble.

20:16.149 --> 20:17.582
Whoa!

20:17.583 --> 20:19.016
Hit it, Rubble.

20:21.854 --> 20:26.290
MARSHALL:
Umm, help.

20:26.292 --> 20:26.841
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

20:26.842 --> 20:27.391
MARSHALL:
Umm, help.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.176
Marshall?

20:28.177 --> 20:28.960
MARSHALL:
Umm, help.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.279
I kind of got caught
when the wall went up.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.597
MARSHALL:
Umm, help.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.682
Silly pup! Jump?

20:34.683 --> 20:35.765
MARSHALL:
Umm, help.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.334
Wee!

20:36.335 --> 20:36.901
MARSHALL:
Umm, help.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.504
Thanks, Ryder.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.106
MARSHALL:
Umm, help.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.445
(Barking)

20:47.447 --> 20:48.162
Hammer.

(Barking)

20:52.085 --> 20:53.751
(Horn honking)

20:53.753 --> 20:55.753
The food's here! Let's hustle!

20:55.754 --> 20:57.754
(Horn honking)

21:00.226 --> 21:01.158
(Barking)

21:01.160 --> 21:01.709
Done.
Done.

21:01.710 --> 21:02.259
(Barking)

21:02.262 --> 21:02.677
Great job.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.093
(Barking)

21:03.096 --> 21:05.964
But we're not done yet.
Every barn needs a weather vane.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.833
(Barking)

21:08.835 --> 21:10.084
The barn is back up.

21:10.085 --> 21:11.334
(Barking)

21:11.337 --> 21:12.353
(Cheering)

21:12.354 --> 21:13.370
(Barking)

21:13.373 --> 21:14.222
And so are the decorations.

21:14.223 --> 21:15.072
(Barking)

21:15.074 --> 21:16.324
Great job, pups.

21:16.325 --> 21:17.575
(Barking)

21:17.577 --> 21:19.577
The PAW Patrol
saved the wedding.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.578
(Barking)

21:21.581 --> 21:22.046
Thank you so much.

21:22.047 --> 21:22.512
(Barking)

21:22.515 --> 21:23.748
I couldn't have done it
without the pups.

21:23.749 --> 21:24.982
(Barking)

21:26.386 --> 21:27.718
So beautiful!

21:27.720 --> 21:29.470
But where's the other
pair of lovebirds?

21:29.471 --> 21:31.221
So beautiful!

21:31.224 --> 21:32.206
Other pair?
Other pair?

21:34.527 --> 21:35.827
Oh, there's the happy couple.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.128
So beautiful!

21:37.130 --> 21:38.713
Emma and Corny
getting married too?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.297
So beautiful!

21:40.300 --> 21:41.466
They're the perfect piggy pair.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.633
So beautiful!

21:42.635 --> 21:44.101
Al and Yumi, Corny and Emma,

21:44.102 --> 21:45.568
So beautiful!

21:45.571 --> 21:47.121
I now declare you
husband and wife

You all right, Chase?

22:01.854 --> 22:02.453
So beautiful!

22:02.455 --> 22:04.072
I must have gotten something
in my eye.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.690
So beautiful!

Just 'cause it's your wedding,

22:24.426 --> 22:25.041
So beautiful!

22:25.044 --> 22:26.911
doesn't mean you get to eat
the whole cake.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.779
So beautiful!

22:28.781 --> 22:31.365
You don't eat the bouquet, Emma.
You toss it. Ready?
