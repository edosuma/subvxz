Hey, got Diablo there,

Guess that's supposed
to be a good ride, huh?

01:07.860 --> 01:09.400
Good enough
for first place.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.270
One hell of a way to spend
a day off, boy.

01:11.270 --> 01:12.900
Heh. I can't think
of a better way.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.370
I can think of a million
better ways.

Yeah, all starting

Can I have your
autograph, please?

01:31.450 --> 01:32.620
Oh.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.720
You did so good
in the rodeo.

too?

N-No. I, um...

01:44.400 --> 01:45.800
Oh, Walker.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.430
When are you riding again,
Walker?

01:47.440 --> 01:48.740
Oh, soon.
Soon?

Mm-hm.

Let me ask you something,
and be honest, all right?

02:05.620 --> 02:06.650
What?

02:06.650 --> 02:08.050
How hard is it?

02:08.060 --> 02:10.160
How hard is what?

02:10.160 --> 02:13.060
H-How difficult is it to ride
one of those wild animals?

02:13.060 --> 02:16.730
Heh-heh. Well, you have to learn
how to ride a tame one first.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.100
No, I'm serious.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.930
Well, I'm serious too.

Well, how long
would it take?

No, the bull riding
is going on right now.

So?

So, what are two rodeo clowns
doing out here?

Okay, let's do it.
Let's go.

Yup.

right this time?

05:00.630 --> 05:01.960
Nope, you're not
even mentioned.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.360
What do you mean,
I'm not mentioned?

05:03.370 --> 05:05.500
This isn't about
that armored car heist.

are so used to Walker

they don't even bother.

donating his rodeo winnings

rescue center.

You gave that $10,000
to a bunch of chipmunks?

05:17.410 --> 05:18.910
I like chipmunks.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.180
You still got the buckle,
though, right?

05:21.180 --> 05:23.750

Look, I'm really
sorry to bother you.

I mean, you've done so much
for us and all.

That's all right, Frances.
What's wrong?

06:07.330 --> 06:10.260
Well, I-I'm worried
about Billy.

from work last night,

it was our anniversary.

I made a special dinner
and everything.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.810
Is this the first time
he's done something like that?

06:22.810 --> 06:24.410
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

It ain't like Billy at all.

I would do that.

for my badge.

of Corrections."

I was doing my job
when you butted in.

I didn't know the state hired
men who ransack private property

08:48.420 --> 08:49.820
and terrorize
innocent people.

I was searching the place
and questioning a witness.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.390
Well within my authority.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.600
I'd say you exceeded
your authority.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.170
Well, from what I understand,

08:59.170 --> 09:00.930
you don't use a lot of
"please" and "thank you"

09:00.940 --> 09:01.940
in your line of business.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.770
My line of business
is criminals,

09:03.770 --> 09:05.070
not women and children.

09:05.070 --> 09:08.210
Different rules apply
in my game.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.240
I deal with the scum
of the earth.

wind up back inside,

09:12.750 --> 09:14.850

to hook 'em up.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.930
Billy didn't show up
for work last night.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.230
I came to get him.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.800
He's going back
to the joint.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.200
Missing a shift is no reason
to revoke his parole.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.830
Yeah, well, he tested dirty
for drugs too.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.240
That's a lie,
Billy don't use drugs.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.240
Yeah?

09:37.240 --> 09:40.640
I got a lab report
says otherwise.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.980
If he comes to see you,

09:42.980 --> 09:44.480
you have him give me a call,
hear?

09:44.480 --> 09:47.080
It'll be a lot easier on him
if I don't come after him.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.220
And I'll expect you

09:51.220 --> 09:53.350
to stay the hell
out of my jurisdiction.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.320
Next time,

09:56.330 --> 09:58.760
I won't be blindsided.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.530
If there is a next time,

10:01.530 --> 10:03.800
I won't have to.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.630
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

10:13.810 --> 10:16.180

Billy was really hot
back then,

10:16.180 --> 10:18.450
winnin' one race
after another.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.710
But then
at Altamont Speedway,

10:20.720 --> 10:24.420
his car went off the track
at 120 miles per hour,

10:24.420 --> 10:27.850
and, well, his career
was pretty much over.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.060
He still walks
with a limp.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.160
Really?
Yeah.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.390
It was downhill
after that.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.530
We was broke.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.800
Billy couldn't get work,

10:38.800 --> 10:40.500
and sometimes
we didn't even eat.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.270
You know,
he was desperate.

10:43.270 --> 10:44.470
( chuckles )

10:44.470 --> 10:46.640
So, what did Billy
wind up doing?

10:46.640 --> 10:48.540
Well, the blackest day
of his life

10:48.540 --> 10:50.480
was when he drove
the getaway car

10:50.480 --> 10:52.210
in a bank job
that went sour.

10:53.550 --> 10:54.680
Let me guess.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.550
It was Walker
that showed up.

10:56.550 --> 10:57.850
Yes, sir.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.490
Took down the gang
single-handed, right?

10:59.490 --> 11:00.520
That's right.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.790
Why doesn't
that surprise me?

11:03.320 --> 11:06.460
Look, Ranger Trivette,
my husband is a good man.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.060
He's a victim
of circumstances.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.860
I think Ranger Walker
saw that.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.600
That's why he convinced Billy
to turn state's evidence

11:13.600 --> 11:15.870
and helped him
get a lighter sentence.

11:15.870 --> 11:18.100
When Billy came up
on parole,

11:18.110 --> 11:20.270
Walker was right there
vouchin' for him.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.640
So, what's Billy doing now?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.080
He's a delivery truck driver

11:24.080 --> 11:26.950
for the Lone Eagle
liquor warehouse.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.020
Walker got him the job.

11:29.020 --> 11:32.720
That was about,
uh, four months ago.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.360
I checked at all
the hospitals. Nothing.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.060
Oh, thank God.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.100
Frances, you have any idea
what would make him

11:43.100 --> 11:44.260
stay away from home?

11:44.270 --> 11:47.730
No, no.
Everything's fine.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.370
I mean, I did notice
about three weeks ago

11:50.370 --> 11:52.470
Billy started
gettin' kind of moody.

11:52.470 --> 11:53.810
I tried to find out
what was wrong,

11:53.810 --> 11:55.080
but he wouldn't say.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.910
Look, I want you and Junior
to stay at my ranch

11:57.910 --> 12:00.210
until I locate Billy
and find out what's going on.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.680
Thank you.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.650
Oh, I almost forgot something.

12:04.650 --> 12:06.350
(<i> country harmonica theme</i>
<i> playing</i> )

12:06.350 --> 12:08.150
Look what you won yesterday.

12:10.590 --> 12:12.390
Thanks, Uncle Cordell.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.390
( laughs )

12:14.400 --> 12:15.600
Mom, look what I won.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.060
Yeah.
That's great, huh?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.170
Hey, let's try
it on.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.000
You like that.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.100
Huh? You like it?

12:22.100 --> 12:24.140
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

12:39.350 --> 12:42.150
( cows mooing )

12:42.160 --> 12:44.990
Kilmer had no right
barging in like that.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.830
ALEX:
I didn't say
it was right, Walker,

12:46.830 --> 12:48.230
but it is the law.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.960
Ex-cons are wards
of the state

12:49.960 --> 12:51.730
until they're
released from parole.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.870
The legal safeguards
that you and I enjoy

12:53.870 --> 12:55.800
just don't apply to them.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.470
A parole officer
can go in

12:57.470 --> 12:59.100
and search them
or their premises

12:59.110 --> 13:01.810
any time, any place,
without a warrant.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.340
Billy doesn't do drugs.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.780
It doesn't matter.

13:04.780 --> 13:06.780
What do you mean,
"It doesn't matter"?

13:06.780 --> 13:08.110
Kilmer can send
him back to prison

13:08.120 --> 13:10.180
for spitting on the sidewalk
if he wants.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.820
He holds Billy's freedom
in the palm of his hand.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.850
Like God, huh?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.420
Like God.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.960
Who is this guy, anyway?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.690
He used to be a cop.

13:20.690 --> 13:23.760
He got kicked off
the force for brutality,

13:23.760 --> 13:26.600
caught on with Corrections
last year as a parole agent.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.570
Why would they hire
a guy like that?

13:28.570 --> 13:31.570
Listen, there are two kinds
of parole officers.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.470
The ones who come out
of civil service

13:33.470 --> 13:35.210
who believe they
can make a difference,

13:35.210 --> 13:37.510
and then ex-cops,
the ex-prison guards

13:37.510 --> 13:38.840
who are usually assigned

13:38.850 --> 13:41.150
to the hard-core,
non-repentant.

13:41.150 --> 13:44.220
They're expected
to wield a heavy hammer.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.950
Think whatever you want,
Alex,

13:45.950 --> 13:48.590
but there's something
about this guy.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.890
Just let him
do his job, Walker.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.330
Something else:

13:52.330 --> 13:53.890
If you do find Billy Clancey,

13:53.900 --> 13:55.900
and he hasn't committed
a new crime,

13:55.900 --> 13:58.500
you are duty-bound to turn him
over to his parole officer.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.570
Don't hold your breath.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.500
I didn't hear that.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.240
( sighs )

14:04.240 --> 14:06.640
Can we turn our attention
to current business?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.710
I still haven't gotten
the paperwork yet

14:08.710 --> 14:11.140
on yesterday's attempted
armored car heist.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.150
It's in the mail.

14:12.150 --> 14:13.880
Cute.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.550
I have two people in jail.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.650
I'd like to press charges
before their 72 hours are up.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.920
Also, the man who escaped
yesterday

14:20.920 --> 14:23.190
got away with $20,000.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.160
Maybe you could question
those two prisoners

14:25.160 --> 14:26.660
and see who
that fourth man was.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.400
It's pretty much our only chance
of getting that money back.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.130
Walker,

14:35.140 --> 14:38.070
I know you went out on a limb
for Billy.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.970
I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.910
Doesn't the law say
that you're innocent

14:41.910 --> 14:44.180
until proven guilty,
counselor?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.950
MAN 1:
Just want a couple smokes.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.220
MAN 2:
Oh, yeah, forget it, man.

14:50.220 --> 14:51.720
MAN 3:
Go on, man, give it to him.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.850
MAN 2:
You already owe me.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.390
MAN 1:
Shut your cheap mouth.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.420
MAN 3:
Hey, somebody's comin' in.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.560
MAN 1:
Yeah? Who is it?

14:57.560 --> 14:58.760
MAN 2:
Look who's here.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.060
MAN 3:
Well, Walker.

15:01.060 --> 15:02.660
Got a lot of friends
in here, partner.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.800
I met a few of 'em
once or twice.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.570
Go home, Walker!
Get out of here!

15:10.400 --> 15:12.070
(<i> tense theme playing</i> )

15:12.070 --> 15:13.470
Cut him down.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.270
Open seven!

15:15.280 --> 15:16.540
Where's Hyde?
Behind you.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.150
Who did this, Hyde?

15:22.150 --> 15:24.380
He, uh--
He did it himself.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.190
How can he hang himself
with only one working arm?

15:31.090 --> 15:32.360
Who got away
in that pickup?

15:33.530 --> 15:35.290
What pickup?

15:35.300 --> 15:36.660
Who are you afraid of, Hyde?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.160
The guy that hung your buddy?

15:38.170 --> 15:40.230
I'm not tellin' you guys
squat.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.200
Who was the last one
to see Pellam?

15:43.200 --> 15:45.540
He only had one visitor
since he was admitted.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.270
Who?
His parole officer,

15:47.280 --> 15:49.240
Dave Kilmer.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.450
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

16:08.360 --> 16:09.630
Remember when you said,

16:09.630 --> 16:11.060
"What's wrong
with this picture?"

16:11.070 --> 16:12.700
Yeah.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.070
How does a guy in a thankless,
low-paying job

16:15.070 --> 16:17.400
afford a, what,
$3,000 suit

16:17.410 --> 16:20.140
and a $50,000 car?

16:20.140 --> 16:21.940
Rich girlfriend?

16:21.940 --> 16:23.740
Yeah, right.

16:26.650 --> 16:28.250
( people conversing
indistinctly )

16:28.250 --> 16:30.050
Thanks, bud.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.450
That's right.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.250
Look at you,
my little black friend.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.160
Come and see me.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.060
I ain't seen him
in a couple weeks.

16:38.060 --> 16:40.990
This guy's right, man.
Come on.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.530

Come on, man.
Get on, man.

That's not
the way you...

What you doin' here, Walker?

16:54.440 --> 16:56.340
Well, well, well.
Mr. Walker.

16:56.340 --> 16:57.640
Long time no see.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.050

Grundy.

Excuse me.

Gentlemen,

17:14.060 --> 17:15.660
how may I help you?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.099
One of your parolees
hung himself

17:17.099 --> 17:18.599
in county jail yesterday.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.800
Pellam.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.069
You don't say?
I do say.

17:22.069 --> 17:24.640
He was part of that attempted
armored car heist yesterday.

17:26.369 --> 17:28.410
You know,
I'm really puzzled here.

17:28.410 --> 17:31.210
How could a guy hang himself
with one good arm?

17:31.210 --> 17:32.480
I haven't got a clue.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.080
TRIVETTE:
Well, we checked.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.780
And another robber, Max Hyde,
is also one of your parolees.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.080
And so is the DOA.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.820
Roy Custer.

17:39.820 --> 17:43.020
I just put his jacket
in the outgoing file.

17:44.290 --> 17:45.960
You keep it up, Walker.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.590
You're lightenin'
my caseload.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.460
Well, the odds are the guy
that got away in the pickup

17:50.470 --> 17:52.230
was one of yours too,

17:52.230 --> 17:54.700
and he got away
with 20 grand.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.240
( chuckles )

17:57.240 --> 17:59.340
What's so funny?

17:59.340 --> 18:02.040
You're probably right.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.010
You're standing 10 feet away
from where...

18:06.010 --> 18:08.850
most of the crimes committed
in this county are hatched.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.380
You have all the answers,
don't you?

18:11.390 --> 18:13.050
I try.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.350
I want Billy Clancey's file.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.190
It's been filed.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.890
I don't know
what your game is, Kilmer,

18:18.890 --> 18:21.130
but I'm gonna find out.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.030
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

18:42.380 --> 18:44.950
That'll cost you
another 50.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.290
Hey--
Kilmer.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.690
I want my money.

18:47.690 --> 18:48.750
What money?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.490
You got away
with 20 grand.

18:50.490 --> 18:51.690
Oh, that money.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.360
Uh, I meant
to give it to you--

18:53.360 --> 18:54.890
Give it to me now!

18:56.330 --> 18:58.960
I plan the perfect job
and you blow it.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.570
You forgot to mention
the part

19:00.570 --> 19:01.970
about the Texas Rangers
showin' up.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.640
Ugh!

19:05.640 --> 19:08.140
Don't you smart-mouth me.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.680
And it better all be there.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.240
( gasping ):
It is.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.180
Honest.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.380
Except for the 50
I gave to Bambi.

19:19.020 --> 19:21.650
Hey, I worked hard for that.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.960
You--

19:29.200 --> 19:31.630
Don't ever cross me again.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.900
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

19:49.150 --> 19:51.920
Now, you're gonna tell me
where Billy Clancey is,

19:51.920 --> 19:53.820
'cause if you don't--

19:53.820 --> 19:55.820
WALKER:
If he doesn't, what?

19:59.330 --> 20:02.030
He'll be harboring
a parole jumper.

20:02.030 --> 20:04.400
That's against the law.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.100
Are you done with
your questioning, Kilmer?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.240
Yeah.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.700
Good.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.110
Heh. Thanks a lot, man.

20:14.110 --> 20:15.370
That's all right.

20:16.540 --> 20:18.510
Do you have any idea
where Billy is?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.810
No, like I said, me and Billy
wasn't that close.

20:20.810 --> 20:22.580
You had to have talked
about something.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.150
Yeah, well, we did.

20:24.150 --> 20:25.220
What did you talk about?

20:25.220 --> 20:26.590
Mostly about huntin'.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.420
I was tryin' to talk Billy
into goin' out with me

20:28.420 --> 20:30.120
as soon as the season
opens next week.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.460
Where do you hunt?

20:31.460 --> 20:33.960
I got me a little shack down
on the north fork of the Brazos.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.360
The Brazos?
That's pheasant country.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.000
Oh, I don't shoot birds.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.930
Javelina pig's
my game.

20:41.970 --> 20:44.440
Okay, thanks a lot.

20:45.570 --> 20:46.610
Billy's a nice guy.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.510
I hope he ain't in no trouble.

20:48.510 --> 20:51.610
I wish I could figure out
why Billy's running.

20:51.610 --> 20:53.750
Well, if Farley told Billy
where the cabin was,

20:53.750 --> 20:55.380
maybe he headed there.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.080
So how are we
gonna go find him?

20:57.090 --> 20:59.520
Well, javelinas stick
pretty much to the scrub brush.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.390
That would be Palo Pinto.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.560
(<i> country theme playing</i> )

Follow 'em.

kill 'em all.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.820
You got it, Mr. K.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.350
You do this for me,
Quint,

21:32.350 --> 21:34.420
and I'll cut you loose
from parole.

of incentive.

Billy!

Billy Clancey!

22:18.730 --> 22:20.300

be Farley's cabin.

all my love, Billy."

Anniversary present?

22:48.600 --> 22:51.530
Yeah, that means
he's around here somewhere.

22:51.530 --> 22:53.470
Let's go find him.

Billy?

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

Why would I want to do that?

23:26.700 --> 23:29.330
Well, didn't Kilmer send you?

23:31.040 --> 23:33.210
Mr. Walker.

23:33.210 --> 23:34.370
Hello, Billy.

23:34.370 --> 23:36.510
Come on, we got to talk.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.590
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

24:07.840 --> 24:10.740
Frances was so happy
when I got out.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.680
She figured life
finally cut us a break.

24:13.680 --> 24:14.850
Well, it did,
but, uh,

24:14.850 --> 24:16.450
all the breaks
were bad.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.960
I might've
had a chance,

24:30.970 --> 24:32.600
but I caught
the wrong parole officer.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.000
Dave Kilmer?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.100
Yeah... "Crime Wave" Dave.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.540
"Crime Wave" Dave?

24:37.540 --> 24:39.440
BILLY:
Yeah, that's what his ex-cons
call him.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.670
To stay on his good side,
they have to pull jobs for him.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.110
He gets them jobs where
they deal with a lot of cash,

24:45.110 --> 24:47.480
and then they case
the place for him,

24:47.480 --> 24:49.380
and then he puts together a team
from his caseload

24:49.380 --> 24:51.120
and they take the place down.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.820
Truck hijackings,
bank robberies,

24:53.820 --> 24:55.220
armored car heists,
you name it.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.990
You gotta be puttin' me on.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.420
If they don't go along with it,

24:59.430 --> 25:01.090
or if they cross him,

25:01.090 --> 25:03.430
he revokes their parole and
sends them back to the joint.

25:03.430 --> 25:06.200
He wanted me to take down
the Lone Eagle liquor warehouse.

25:07.270 --> 25:09.270
I hope to God
you can prove this.

25:09.270 --> 25:12.170
That's why I didn't go to
Mr. Walker in the first place.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.170
I-- It's only my word
against his.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.310
And you know
how they listen to ex-cons.

25:16.310 --> 25:19.380
Besides, uh...

25:19.380 --> 25:21.450
I'm scared to death that
Kilmer's gonna do somethin'

25:21.450 --> 25:22.650
to Frances and Junior.

25:22.650 --> 25:26.450
They're out at my ranch.
They're okay.

25:26.450 --> 25:29.020
Kilmer always stays
in the background, right?

25:29.020 --> 25:31.120
Yeah. No, he don't get dirty.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.130
I hear he has a warehouse
full of stuff from his jobs.

25:34.130 --> 25:35.990
Trucks it across the border
and sells it

25:36.000 --> 25:37.660
on the black market in Mexico.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.970
Why didn't you come to me,
Billy?

25:39.970 --> 25:41.600
I know I let you down,
Mr. Walker,

25:41.600 --> 25:43.470
and I feel terrible about it.

25:45.670 --> 25:48.040
You didn't let me down, Billy.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.980
If you'd gone with Kilmer,

25:50.980 --> 25:52.880
you'd have let me down.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.550
Where are you going?

25:56.550 --> 25:58.720
I'll be right back.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.720
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

26:05.930 --> 26:07.990
Yeah, Walker got to him first.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.160
Little dirtbag's
spillin' his guts.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.030
Walker knows everything.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.730
You're not helping me, Quint.

26:13.730 --> 26:16.330
Well, here's something that
might be of some use to ya.

26:16.340 --> 26:19.410
Walker's got Clancey's family
stashed at his ranch.

26:19.410 --> 26:22.240
I want it to end out there.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.910
Kill Clancey, Walker,
and his partner Tonto.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.410
Whatever you say, Mr. K.,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.180
but it's gonna cost you big.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.090
Don't squeeze me, Quint.

26:33.090 --> 26:36.350
It'll cost you five years
if you do.

26:40.330 --> 26:41.330
WALKER:
Texas Ranger.

26:41.330 --> 26:42.330
Drop the rifle.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.430
Man! You scared me, Ranger.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.570
I mean, what's wrong, anyway?

26:48.570 --> 26:50.570
I'm just out here
huntin' some pig.

26:50.570 --> 26:52.940
What were you doing,
calling them in by phone?

26:55.340 --> 26:58.340
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

27:05.390 --> 27:07.050
Don't think of it, now.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.220
(grunts)

27:15.660 --> 27:16.860
I told you
he'd come for me.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.960
Just stay put. Just...

27:33.610 --> 27:35.080
( Quint yells )

27:42.090 --> 27:44.520
Settle down, or I'll hurt ya.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.320
( groaning )

28:03.010 --> 28:04.340
( chuckles )

28:07.010 --> 28:08.380
How'd you spot him?

28:08.380 --> 28:11.180
The glint off the phone.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.190
Did Kilmer send you after Billy?

28:13.190 --> 28:14.720
Who's Kilmer?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.220
Probably your parole officer.

28:16.220 --> 28:17.720
I don't know any Kilmer,

28:17.730 --> 28:19.220
and who the hell's Billy?

28:19.230 --> 28:21.960
I told you,
I was huntin' pig.

28:22.830 --> 28:24.100
He was talkin' on this?

28:24.100 --> 28:25.430
Yeah.

28:25.430 --> 28:29.430
Maybe the redial button
will tell us who he called last.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.200
Livin' in the 20th century
pays off, occasionally.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.210
( telephone rings )

28:36.580 --> 28:38.640
Parole office. Kilmer.

28:39.710 --> 28:40.780
Kilmer.

28:43.850 --> 28:45.920
I must've dialed
the wrong number.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.920
Sure, you did.

28:49.290 --> 28:50.290
Hello, Kilmer.

28:50.290 --> 28:51.290
Who's this?

28:51.290 --> 28:52.290
<i> Walker.</i>

28:52.290 --> 28:54.060
What do you want?

28:54.060 --> 28:56.460
Do you have a parolee
named Quint?

28:56.460 --> 28:57.760
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> What about it?</i>

28:57.770 --> 28:59.900
He just tried to take out
Billy Clancey.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.630
Doesn't surprise me.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.800
There was bad blood
between him and Billy.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.640
Went back to the joint.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.770
Is that why
he just called you?

29:07.780 --> 29:10.240
My parolees are always
checkin' in with me.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.180
Just before they commit a crime?

29:12.180 --> 29:13.310
Yeah.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.180
Sometimes.

29:15.180 --> 29:17.720
I guess they think it's funny.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.220
In fact, I was about to revoke
Quint's parole.

29:20.220 --> 29:22.390
I'm glad you caught him.

29:22.390 --> 29:24.220
Saved me the trouble.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.390
Your trouble is just beginning,
pal.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.400
(<i> subdued theme playing</i> )

29:34.330 --> 29:35.830
So, what do we got
here, now?

29:35.840 --> 29:37.970
What we've got is
a guy running a robbery ring

29:37.970 --> 29:40.240
right from his desk.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.840
You think it's Kilmer that's
responsible for this crime wave

29:42.840 --> 29:45.080
that's grippin' Dallas
for the last six months?

29:45.080 --> 29:46.980
I'd bet on it.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.480
Come here.

30:06.730 --> 30:09.000
Dang it, he's gone.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.270
This is gonna get ugly.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.280
( horse whinnies )

30:19.410 --> 30:21.510
It's like I told you,
Chief Billy,

30:21.520 --> 30:23.420
if you hold open your hands,

30:23.420 --> 30:24.750
life will come to you.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.690
Uncle Cordell!

30:33.230 --> 30:34.260
Hiya, pal.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.630
Did you find my daddy?

30:35.630 --> 30:37.560
Yeah, I sure did.
We talked.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.500
Whoa! Look at that.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.000
Uh, where is he?

30:41.700 --> 30:43.540
Uh...

30:43.540 --> 30:46.200
I'm not really sure right now,
Frances, but...

30:46.210 --> 30:49.780
he wanted you to know
that he still loves ya

30:49.780 --> 30:50.940
and that everything's fine.

30:50.940 --> 30:52.440
He'll explain everything to you

30:52.450 --> 30:54.050
as soon as he can.

30:54.050 --> 30:57.280
Oh, meanwhile, he wanted me
to give you this.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.720
Oh.

30:59.820 --> 31:00.820
Oh...

31:00.820 --> 31:03.820
Ahh! Very pretty.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.390
Billy bought this?

31:05.390 --> 31:06.560
Yeah, he sure did.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.060
He hopes you like it.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.660
Oh, I do.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.060
I just wish that
he would come home.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.830
He will, Frances.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.700
As soon as he can.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.700
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

31:34.350 --> 31:36.150
Hey, Walker,

31:36.160 --> 31:37.920
let me ask you something.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.830
What the devil is he doing?

31:41.830 --> 31:45.500
How much rosin am I supposed
to put on this glove?

31:45.500 --> 31:47.170
You don't wear a glove.

31:48.030 --> 31:49.530
I knew that.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.740
Oh, you wear a glove
for bareback riding.

31:52.740 --> 31:53.740
Right.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.280
<i> "Harmony with Horses"?</i>

31:56.280 --> 31:59.780
Look, do I have everything
I need for bronc riding?

31:59.780 --> 32:01.250
Right?

32:01.250 --> 32:03.750
Well, you could use
a jock strap.

32:04.620 --> 32:05.780
I got these.

32:05.790 --> 32:06.890
Oh, man.

32:06.890 --> 32:10.220
Uh, look, can we get
back to business?

32:10.220 --> 32:11.320
We've gotta find Billy

32:11.330 --> 32:13.220
and get him to the DA.

32:13.230 --> 32:14.890
We gotta do
more than that.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.230
We got a con's word
against Kilmer's,

32:17.230 --> 32:18.600
we got no crime committed,

32:18.600 --> 32:20.130
so that's gonna be
pretty tough to file.

32:20.130 --> 32:21.130
Yeah.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.670
These are cutting horse spurs.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.240
You know,
all we've gotta do

32:28.240 --> 32:30.440
is find some of Kilmer's cons

32:30.440 --> 32:31.610
and get them to talk.

32:31.610 --> 32:32.910
I don't see how.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.980
You saw the fear in their eyes.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.350
I can't believe how bold
Kilmer is.

32:36.350 --> 32:38.020
I really think
he thinks he's untouchable.

32:38.020 --> 32:40.920
Yeah, but he's gotta be
getting nervous right now.

What do you think
their next move is?

32:44.220 --> 32:46.060

to get to Billy.

You're gonna tell your story.

I know Billy's story
won't convict Kilmer,

34:34.900 --> 34:37.800
but at least we can
arrest and indict him.

And that's all I need right now,
Alex.

All right, Walker, I'll listen.

Tell her your story.

See, the truth is, um...

I got too drunk

35:02.260 --> 35:04.500
to go to work,

35:04.500 --> 35:06.930
and I was ashamed
to tell Frances,

35:06.930 --> 35:08.730
so I took off.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.440
Don't do this.

I know that you're mad at me
for lying, Mr. Walker,

35:13.370 --> 35:15.670
but I think the best thing
I can do right now

35:15.680 --> 35:17.510
is turn myself in
to my parole officer

35:17.510 --> 35:20.040

Look at me.

Because I have to.

Can I go now?

35:35.630 --> 35:37.560
You've committed no crime
that I know of,

35:37.560 --> 35:39.160
and the parole office

35:39.170 --> 35:40.730
hasn't filed
a parole violation, so...

35:40.730 --> 35:42.930
yes, you're free to go.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.470
TRIVETTE:
He's a friend of yours?

35:49.440 --> 35:50.480
Why would he lie?

35:50.480 --> 35:52.410
I'm gonna find out.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.380
Billy!

36:02.320 --> 36:03.320
Come here.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.500
What do you think you're doing?

36:10.500 --> 36:13.030
It's the only way to save
Frances and my boy.

36:13.030 --> 36:14.370
If you go back to
Kilmer's office,

36:14.370 --> 36:15.530
he's gonna send you
to prison.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.740
Maybe, but they'll live.

36:16.740 --> 36:17.900
How do you know that?

36:17.900 --> 36:20.210
He's not gonna leave
any witnesses.

36:20.210 --> 36:22.440
I don't have any other choice.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.280
I know you're scared,

36:24.280 --> 36:26.410
but I can help ya if you'll
come back and tell the truth.

36:26.410 --> 36:29.580
Thank you, Mr. Walker, but...

36:29.580 --> 36:31.820
I gotta turn it around
by myself.

36:31.820 --> 36:33.790
I mean, Kilmer's got
Frances and Junior.

36:33.790 --> 36:35.350
I've let them down in the past

36:35.360 --> 36:36.720
and I'm not about
to do it again.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.120
I do thank you
for all you've done,

36:38.130 --> 36:40.460
but the rest is up to me.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.100
And the rest is up to him?

36:52.110 --> 36:53.410
That's what he said.

36:54.570 --> 36:57.180
You'd think he'd know better
by now.

36:57.180 --> 36:59.440
Well, the kid's scared.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.710
He has no faith
in the system anymore.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.780
No wonder, having a parole
officer like David Kilmer.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.790
I tell ya, that guy's beginnin'
to get on my nerves.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.730
I mean, we're stuck.

37:14.730 --> 37:15.730
Right?

37:15.730 --> 37:16.730
He's got us sittin' here.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.000
We gotta stop this thing

37:18.000 --> 37:19.500
before it gets any further
out of hand.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.230
Well, I love my job, but...

37:25.840 --> 37:29.570
Sometimes I-I wish
I didn't have to uphold the law.

37:30.140 --> 37:31.780
Yeah,

37:31.780 --> 37:34.280
sometimes I do wish that.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.980
I know how you feel.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.090
But fortunately...

37:40.090 --> 37:42.320
that's the way we are.

37:44.930 --> 37:45.920
Let's hit the road.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.430
I think better when I'm driving.

37:53.770 --> 37:56.770
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

38:02.940 --> 38:04.440
( engine starts )

38:21.130 --> 38:23.360
I hear you wanna see me.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.870
( sighs )

38:30.870 --> 38:33.170
I know Billy thinks he's doing
the right thing,

38:33.170 --> 38:35.440
but if we're gonna keep him
out of prison,

38:35.440 --> 38:38.280
we're gonna have to work this
from another angle.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.540
Frances and Billy Jr.?

38:39.550 --> 38:41.550
Yeah.

38:41.550 --> 38:43.950
All we gotta do is find out
where Kilmer's got 'em stashed.

38:43.950 --> 38:46.480
What about the warehouse
Billy was talking about?

38:46.490 --> 38:48.490
How we gonna find it?

38:48.490 --> 38:51.460
Talk to one of Kilmer's cons.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.890
Right behind you.

38:53.890 --> 38:56.160
I'm gonna tell you what,
Trivette,

38:56.160 --> 38:58.700
if anything happens
to that little boy,

38:58.700 --> 39:02.500
there won't be a hole deep
enough for Kilmer to hide in.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.210
Yo, Walker.

39:09.210 --> 39:12.180
You got no reason
to roust me, man!

39:12.180 --> 39:14.150
I'm gonna
ask you once...

39:14.150 --> 39:16.850
nicely.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.820
Where's Billy Clancey's
wife and kid?

39:18.820 --> 39:22.290
Hey, man, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

39:22.290 --> 39:24.020
Okay.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.520
Trivette.

39:31.330 --> 39:32.430
( rattling )

39:32.430 --> 39:33.430
What's in the bag?

39:33.430 --> 39:35.100
What does it sound like?

39:35.100 --> 39:37.570
( louder rattling )

39:37.570 --> 39:39.140
Hear you're afraid of snakes.

39:39.140 --> 39:42.540
Oh, hey--
Hey, man, you're crazy.

39:42.540 --> 39:44.240
We've been told that.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.110
No! No!

39:46.110 --> 39:47.450
Trivette, how long does it take

39:47.450 --> 39:50.220
for someone to die
from a snakebite?

39:50.220 --> 39:52.250
Couple, two, three hours.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.890
But I hear it's really painful.

39:53.890 --> 39:56.290
Yeah, that's what I hear, I hear
you start swelling all up,

39:56.290 --> 39:58.860
your neck starts to swell,
where you can't breathe,

39:58.860 --> 40:01.290
and you start choking,
going "ugh", "ugh", "ugh"...

40:01.290 --> 40:03.090
TRIVETTE: That's what I hear.
WALKER: Yeah.

40:04.460 --> 40:05.600
Grundy.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.730
Turn around here.

40:07.730 --> 40:08.970
For the last time,

40:08.970 --> 40:11.700
where is Billy Clancey's
wife and kid?

40:11.710 --> 40:13.270
Man, you know I can't tell ya.

40:13.270 --> 40:14.470
Kilmer'll kill me!

40:14.470 --> 40:15.770
You're gonna die anyway.

40:15.780 --> 40:16.840
Put the sack on his head.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.510
No! No! Wait!

40:18.510 --> 40:19.710
Wait!

40:19.710 --> 40:21.780
They're in a warehouse
at 6th and Main!

40:21.780 --> 40:23.620
Just take it away!

40:23.620 --> 40:25.550
Let's go.

40:25.550 --> 40:27.090
No! No, leave it in the bag!

40:27.090 --> 40:28.190
Leave it in the bag!

40:28.190 --> 40:29.690
( growls )

40:29.690 --> 40:31.020
( laughs )

40:31.020 --> 40:32.960
Oh, man!

40:32.960 --> 40:34.490
Grraah!

40:34.490 --> 40:38.000
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
( knock at door )

40:41.630 --> 40:44.170
You said you'd let them walk out
if I came with you.

40:44.170 --> 40:46.870
And you were dumb enough
to believe me.

40:46.870 --> 40:48.370
You're goin' south

40:48.380 --> 40:49.710
in the next shipment.

40:49.710 --> 40:52.440
Only, you won't be alive
to enjoy the trip.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.010
I'm sorry, baby.

40:54.010 --> 40:55.010
( gun cocks )

40:55.010 --> 40:57.720
MAN:
The door!
Hey! Door!

40:57.720 --> 40:59.320
KILMER:
Check it out.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.590
( all shouting )

41:08.730 --> 41:10.260
Come on!

41:12.170 --> 41:13.700
Other side!
What do you got?

41:13.700 --> 41:15.670
It's rigged!

41:16.500 --> 41:17.870
MAN 1: Behind the grate.

41:17.870 --> 41:19.400
MAN 2: Come with me.
MAN 3: It's Walker!

41:24.940 --> 41:27.310
( shouting indistinctly )

41:30.150 --> 41:32.380
MAN 1:
Come on! Come with me!

41:32.380 --> 41:33.380
MAN 2:
Come on, men.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.190
( gunshots )

41:36.190 --> 41:37.620
( Kilmer shouts indistinctly )

41:39.290 --> 41:41.160
Untie your son.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.160
MAN 3:
Take him, man.

41:47.030 --> 41:49.500
MAN 1:
I'm going around
the back side!

41:51.800 --> 41:53.770
MAN 2:
I've got a bead on him!

41:55.070 --> 41:56.610
MAN 1:
If you see him,
you take him down!

41:56.610 --> 41:58.810
MAN 2:
He's in the corner!

41:58.810 --> 41:59.810
( grunts )

41:59.810 --> 42:00.810
Remember me?

42:00.810 --> 42:01.810
( grunting )

42:20.200 --> 42:22.200
( Kilmer grunting )

42:37.320 --> 42:38.650
( Kilmer panting )

42:38.650 --> 42:40.550
You said next time
I won't blindside you, Kilmer?

42:42.360 --> 42:44.460
You'll see this one coming.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.000
Well, maybe not.

43:02.540 --> 43:03.540
Don't!

43:08.350 --> 43:10.010
Billy!

43:10.020 --> 43:12.480
Oh, God, please be okay.

43:12.490 --> 43:14.090
Daddy? Daddy?

43:14.090 --> 43:16.090
( Frances crying )

43:29.940 --> 43:31.570
All right, yeah!

43:31.570 --> 43:33.940
Happy anniversary!
Happy number seven!

43:33.940 --> 43:35.070
Baked it up myself.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.980
Oh, sure you did.

43:36.980 --> 43:39.110
Ahem. Shall we blow out
the candles?

43:39.680 --> 43:40.880
Yeah? Okay.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.610
Ready? Go!

43:42.620 --> 43:44.620
All right, all right!
All right...

43:44.620 --> 43:46.920
( all laugh )

43:46.920 --> 43:48.620
Billy's testimony
did the trick.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.520
The grand jury just
indicted Kilmer.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.460
Oh... Oh!

43:53.760 --> 43:55.030
Did you tell him yet?

43:55.030 --> 43:56.660
No, I haven't told him yet.

43:58.460 --> 44:00.700
Walker got you released
from your parole.

44:00.700 --> 44:02.330
Oh, Walker.

44:02.340 --> 44:03.700
And you got your job back.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.070
All right, enough of that.
Cut the cake. Come on.

44:10.110 --> 44:11.940
Someone's hungry.

44:11.940 --> 44:12.940
Okay.

44:12.950 --> 44:14.950
Okay!
All right!

44:21.820 --> 44:23.490
Okay, Walker, let her go.

44:23.490 --> 44:25.490
You sure?

44:26.230 --> 44:28.260
Yeah. Rock and roll, man.

44:28.260 --> 44:29.760
Okay.

44:41.110 --> 44:42.840
Giddyup.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.340
All right, James.

44:45.350 --> 44:46.540
Heh. Yeah.

44:46.550 --> 44:48.080
Heh-heh.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.310
Giddyup!

44:49.320 --> 44:51.520
( chuckles softly )

44:51.520 --> 44:53.890
That's right,
that's right.

44:55.390 --> 44:57.320
( horse neighs )

44:57.320 --> 44:58.690
( chuckles )

44:58.690 --> 45:00.360
Giddyup.

45:03.330 --> 45:04.330
Jimmy...

45:06.100 --> 45:08.630
You got to show the horse
who's boss!

45:08.630 --> 45:09.630
Aah!

45:09.640 --> 45:10.640
Hyah! Hyah!

45:10.640 --> 45:13.340
Oh...my...God! Walker!

45:13.340 --> 45:16.040
Somebody! Somebody!

45:16.040 --> 45:18.180
Please! Walker!

45:18.180 --> 45:19.240
Somebody!

45:19.250 --> 45:20.810
Somebody!

45:20.810 --> 45:22.810
Please! Walker!
