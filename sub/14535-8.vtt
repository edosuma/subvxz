Narrator:
<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "The American West"...</i>

00:10.000 --> 00:11.458
<i> In the years</i>
<i> since the country</i>

00:11.458 --> 00:14.041
<i> was ripped apart</i>
<i> by Civil War,</i>

00:14.041 --> 00:17.208
<i> America has blazed</i>
<i> a trail west,</i>

00:17.208 --> 00:20.125
<i> but it hasn't been easy.</i>

00:20.125 --> 00:23.041
<i> As the railroads</i>
<i> cut across the landscape,</i>

00:23.041 --> 00:26.500
<i>they triggered bloody conflicts</i>
<i> with Indian nations</i>

00:26.500 --> 00:29.375
<i> and became targets</i>
<i> for outlaws.</i>

00:31.417 --> 00:33.208
Stay in your seats.
Do not move.

00:33.208 --> 00:35.250
Narrator:
<i> But as men like Jesse James</i>

00:35.250 --> 00:38.583
<i> and Billy the Kid</i>
<i> terrorized the nation,</i>

00:38.625 --> 00:41.291
<i> lawmen like Wyatt Earp</i>
<i> emerged,</i>

00:41.291 --> 00:45.041
<i> determined to bring order</i>
<i> to the frontier.</i>

00:45.041 --> 00:47.375
<i> But now the battle</i>
<i> for the West</i>

00:47.375 --> 00:49.417
<i> has reached</i>
<i> a breaking point.</i>

00:51.250 --> 00:55.083
<i> In Missouri, after returning</i>
<i> to a life of crime,</i>

00:55.083 --> 00:58.208
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> has a bounty on his head</i>

00:58.208 --> 01:00.500
<i> and can no longer tell</i>
<i> who to trust.</i>

01:00.500 --> 01:03.709
This is my brother, Robert,
the one I told you about.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.583
Narrator:
<i> While in Tombstone,</i>
<i> Arizona...</i>

01:05.583 --> 01:09.250
- What do you want?
- I want my $3,600.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.583
Narrator:
<i> ...Wyatt Earp's feud</i>

01:10.583 --> 01:13.583
<i> with notorious outlaw</i>
<i> Ike Clanton</i>

01:13.583 --> 01:15.583
<i> has led the lawman</i>
<i> to a showdown</i>

01:15.583 --> 01:17.583
<i> that will change his life</i>

01:17.583 --> 01:20.250
<i> and the West forever.</i>

01:21.500 --> 01:23.250
<i> ( gunfire )</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:27.291
<i> ( theme song playing )</i>

02:28.166 --> 02:31.709
Narrator:
<i> On October 26, 1881,</i>

02:31.709 --> 02:34.166
<i> Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp</i>

02:34.208 --> 02:37.250
<i> leads his brothers</i>
<i> Morgan and Virgil,</i>

02:37.250 --> 02:40.417
<i> along with gunslinger</i>
<i> Doc Holliday,</i>

02:40.417 --> 02:44.250
<i> on a mission to confront</i>
<i> a gang of ruthless outlaws</i>

02:44.250 --> 02:46.834
<i> led by Ike Clanton,</i>

02:46.834 --> 02:48.709
<i> who are waiting</i>
<i> for a fight</i>

02:48.709 --> 02:52.417
<i> near the place</i>
<i> called the "O.K. Corral."</i>

02:52.458 --> 02:55.458
David Eisenbach:
<i> The Earp brothers</i>
<i> and Doc Holliday</i>

02:55.458 --> 02:58.375
are hearing how
Ike's out to kill them

02:58.375 --> 03:02.333
and that Ike
and his friends have guns.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.291
<i> So when they</i>
<i> start marching</i>

03:05.291 --> 03:08.333
<i> towards the cowboys</i>
<i> to disarm them,</i>

03:08.375 --> 03:10.542
the cowboys
who are half-drunk,

03:10.542 --> 03:12.458
all right, you got
a recipe for disaster.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.834
And that's really
what happens.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.417
Give us your guns.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.333
( clicks )

03:43.583 --> 03:45.709
Throw up your hands!

03:45.709 --> 03:48.542
You boys wanna fight,
we'll give you a fight.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.917
I'm not gonna ask again.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.834
Kiefer Sutherland:
<i> Things happen so fast.</i>

04:50.834 --> 04:53.500
And if something
is allowed to escalate

04:53.500 --> 04:55.709
to the point where people are
actually reaching for weapons,

04:55.709 --> 04:57.875
<i> it just takes one person</i>
<i> to panic,</i>

04:57.917 --> 05:00.667
<i> and all of a sudden,</i>
<i> people are dead.</i>

05:00.667 --> 05:03.458
Narrator:
<i> In a matter of 30 seconds,</i>

05:03.458 --> 05:06.375
<i> 30 rounds are fired,</i>

05:06.375 --> 05:07.792
<i> three cowboys lay dead,</i>

05:07.792 --> 05:09.917
<i> including Ike Clanton's</i>
<i> brother Billy.</i>

05:12.625 --> 05:16.667
<i> Wyatt's brothers</i>
<i>and Doc Holliday are wounded...</i>

05:16.667 --> 05:19.500
<i> while Ike Clanton</i>
<i> gets away.</i>

05:23.375 --> 05:26.583
Anne Collier:
<i> In the end only one man</i>
<i> was left standing</i>

05:26.583 --> 05:28.917
and only one man was unhurt,
and that was Wyatt Earp.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.542
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt's uncanny ability</i>

05:33.542 --> 05:36.417
<i> to escape harm</i>
<i> at the O.K. Corral</i>

05:36.417 --> 05:38.750
<i> will become a part</i>
<i> of his legend.</i>

05:42.750 --> 05:45.709
<i> News of the gunfight makes</i>
<i> headlines around the world.</i>

05:47.333 --> 05:48.667
<i> But rather than</i>
<i> becoming a story</i>

05:48.667 --> 05:52.125
<i> of the lost triumph</i>
<i> over outlaws,</i>

05:52.125 --> 05:55.750
<i> Wyatt and his men</i>
<i> are portrayed as criminals.</i>

05:55.750 --> 05:58.959
Ann Kirschner:
<i> It was covered as far away</i>
<i> as Australia.</i>

05:58.959 --> 06:02.709
As a tale of
unbelievable lawlessness.

06:05.417 --> 06:08.458
<i> As time went on,</i>
<i>there was more and more concern</i>

06:08.458 --> 06:11.542
<i> about Tombstone</i>
<i> as the symbol of violence</i>

06:11.542 --> 06:13.542
<i> at the American frontier,</i>

06:13.542 --> 06:17.625
<i> and that had</i>
<i> the business people</i>
<i> very worried.</i>

06:17.625 --> 06:19.750
Narrator:
<i> In the rapidly</i>
<i> developing West,</i>

06:19.750 --> 06:21.709
<i> it's becoming clear</i>

06:21.709 --> 06:25.001
<i> that Wyatt Earp's brand</i>
<i> of frontier justice</i>

06:25.001 --> 06:27.667
<i> is beginning to wear thin.</i>

06:34.709 --> 06:38.625
<i> Ike Clanton, the man</i>
<i> who brought on the gunfight,</i>

06:38.625 --> 06:40.750
<i> sees an opportunity</i>

06:40.750 --> 06:45.417
<i> to finally get his revenge</i>
<i> on the Earp brothers.</i>

06:45.458 --> 06:46.750
Andrew Isenberg:
<i> Ike Clanton and his friends</i>

06:46.750 --> 06:48.750
<i> try to prosecute the Earps</i>
<i> in court.</i>

06:48.750 --> 06:50.750
They bring charges of murder

06:50.750 --> 06:53.583
against the three Earp brothers
and Doc Holliday.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.750
<i> Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday</i>
<i> spend two weeks in jail,</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:59.417
<i> but the judge decides that</i>
<i> there's not enough evidence</i>

06:59.417 --> 07:01.750
<i> to go forward to a trial.</i>

07:11.625 --> 07:15.583
Narrator:
<i> The charges against Wyatt</i>
<i> and his brothers are dropped,</i>

07:15.583 --> 07:17.750
<i> but their image</i>
<i> as noble lawmen</i>

07:17.750 --> 07:20.959
<i> has been</i>
<i> irreversibly damaged.</i>

07:20.959 --> 07:22.959
I don't believe Wyatt Earp
ever woke up in the morning

07:22.959 --> 07:25.667
and said, "I'm gonna
go kill someone today."

07:25.667 --> 07:27.542
<i> He's trying</i>
<i> to marshal a town.</i>

07:27.542 --> 07:29.000
<i> And he's,</i>
<i> unfortunately, the guy</i>

07:29.000 --> 07:31.792
<i> who's gotta keep it</i>
<i> somehow civil.</i>

07:31.792 --> 07:34.667
And eventually people
are gonna wanna go after him.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.667
They don't want us here,
they don't want us.

07:39.667 --> 07:43.500
What do you recommend
that we do?

07:43.500 --> 07:46.792
A lot of folks
are moving to California.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.583
Maybe we should, too.

07:50.917 --> 07:54.750
No. It'll look like they're
running us right out of town.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.542
That's right.

07:57.542 --> 07:58.959
We're not going anywhere.

08:00.542 --> 08:04.750
If we leave Tombstone,
it's on our own terms.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.041
This is where we belong.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.667
Here's to the unflappable
Wyatt Earp.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.875
- To Tombstone.
- Together: To Tombstone.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.542
( glasses clink )

08:19.667 --> 08:21.625
Narrator:
<i> What Wyatt doesn't realize</i>

08:21.625 --> 08:24.583
<i> is that</i>
<i> by staying in Tombstone,</i>

08:24.583 --> 08:26.709
<i> he's making himself</i>
<i> an easy target</i>

08:26.709 --> 08:28.959
<i> for Ike Clanton</i>
<i> and his gang.</i>

08:33.625 --> 08:36.166
<i> Twelve hundred miles away</i>
<i> in Missouri,</i>

08:36.166 --> 08:40.001
<i> Jesse James is settling</i>
<i> back into life as an outlaw.</i>

08:45.667 --> 08:49.001
<i> Despite having</i>
<i> a $5,000 bounty on his head,</i>

08:49.001 --> 08:51.750
<i> Jesse's planning</i>
<i> his next big heist</i>

08:51.750 --> 08:53.750
<i> with the two remaining</i>
<i> gang members</i>

08:53.750 --> 08:56.125
<i> he thinks he can trust...</i>

08:56.125 --> 08:58.583
<i> Robert and Charlie Ford.</i>

08:58.583 --> 09:02.083
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i> Jesse James had</i>
<i> big, big plans.</i>

09:03.959 --> 09:06.000
<i> He was focused on</i>
<i> this bank robbery</i>

09:06.000 --> 09:08.166
<i> that he was planning</i>
<i> with the Ford brothers.</i>

09:08.166 --> 09:11.709
He was gonna rob
the Platte City Bank.

09:11.709 --> 09:13.458
<i> And, you know,</i>
<i> it was typical of Jesse,</i>

09:13.458 --> 09:15.166
<i> because he alluded to them</i>
<i> that this is something</i>

09:15.208 --> 09:17.667
<i> that's-- it's gonna be big</i>
<i> in the papers.</i>

09:17.667 --> 09:20.166
You know, it's something
that's publicized.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.875
<i> So I think that</i>
<i> was exciting for Jesse.</i>

09:24.625 --> 09:26.166
We gotta be careful.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.583
We have to
look after each other.

09:28.583 --> 09:29.750
<i> All right?</i>

09:31.792 --> 09:34.083
Narrator:
<i> Jesse James' latest</i>
<i> string of robberies</i>

09:34.083 --> 09:38.625
<i> has turned him into</i>
<i>America's most wanted criminal.</i>

09:38.625 --> 09:40.709
<i> But what he doesn't realize</i>

09:40.709 --> 09:43.709
<i> is that it's not the law</i>
<i> he should be afraid of.</i>

09:46.041 --> 09:48.083
<i> It's one of his own.</i>

10:04.834 --> 10:07.125
Morgan:
<i>I don't remember</i>
<i>you being this good.</i>

10:07.125 --> 10:09.208
You don't remember
a lot of things, Morgan.

10:14.917 --> 10:18.834
Narrator:
<i> Months after the gunfight</i>
<i> at the O.K. Corral,</i>

10:18.834 --> 10:23.667
<i> Wyatt Earp and his brothers</i>
<i> Morgan and Virgil</i>

10:23.709 --> 10:25.792
<i> are still in Tombstone</i>

10:25.792 --> 10:29.041
<i> trying to carve out</i>
<i> a new life for themselves.</i>

10:29.041 --> 10:30.875
Eisenbach:
<i> Wyatt sticks around</i>
<i> 'cause he's got</i>

10:30.875 --> 10:33.125
<i> financial investments</i>
<i> in town.</i>

10:33.125 --> 10:35.125
And those
financial investments

10:35.125 --> 10:37.083
have just started
to make some money.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.083
<i> So, you know, as far</i>
<i> as the Earps go, right,</i>

10:39.083 --> 10:41.125
<i> that was just</i>
<i> some unfortunate incident.</i>

10:41.125 --> 10:43.125
<i> It's time to move on.</i>

10:43.125 --> 10:45.083
But the Cowboys
weren't letting it go.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.166
<i>Ten dollars.</i>
<i>You still owe me</i>
<i>ten dollars.</i>

10:59.875 --> 11:03.001
<i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>

11:22.125 --> 11:23.875
Cowboy: Virgil.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.750
All right, let me
show you how it's done.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.001
I'm waiting
to see it.

11:35.001 --> 11:36.166
Because you're
my brother,

11:36.166 --> 11:38.166
I'm gonna be easy
on you, all right?

11:38.166 --> 11:40.875
So what you want is--

11:40.875 --> 11:41.917
<i> ( gunshot )</i>

11:52.291 --> 11:53.792
( gunshot )

11:59.001 --> 12:02.000
- Wyatt.
- Somebody call
a doctor.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.709
Morgan.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.083
Morgan.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.166
Oh, God.

12:25.166 --> 12:28.208
Narrator:
<i> Ike Clanton and the Cowboys</i>
<i> murder Morgan...</i>

12:30.001 --> 12:32.917
<i> and cripple Virgil</i>
<i> in retaliation</i>

12:32.917 --> 12:37.875
<i> for the three men who died</i>
<i> at the O.K. Corral.</i>

12:37.875 --> 12:41.291
Kirschner:
<i> Ike Clanton couldn't</i>
<i> get his revenge in court,</i>

12:41.291 --> 12:45.250
<i> and so they basically</i>
<i> had hit men out for the Earps.</i>

12:45.250 --> 12:49.166
This was the moment
of change for Wyatt.

12:50.959 --> 12:54.041
<i> He felt that the law</i>
<i> would no longer protect him...</i>

12:56.041 --> 12:58.041
<i> and decided that</i>
<i> he would take the law</i>

12:58.041 --> 12:59.792
<i> into his own hands.</i>

13:13.083 --> 13:15.291
Wyatt...

13:15.291 --> 13:18.125
<i>are you sure</i>
<i>you wanna do this?</i>

13:18.125 --> 13:21.041
You going soft on me, Doc?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.917
No, sir, I am not.

13:26.208 --> 13:27.959
This is for my brothers.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.458
Lead the way, sir,

13:42.208 --> 13:45.001
Narrator:
<i> To help him avenge</i>
<i> his brother's death,</i>

13:45.001 --> 13:47.250
<i> Wyatt calls on</i>
<i> his trusted friend</i>

13:47.250 --> 13:50.917
<i> Doc Holliday.</i>

13:50.917 --> 13:52.834
<i> Together,</i>
<i> they form a posse</i>

13:52.834 --> 13:54.417
<i> to track down</i>
<i> and take out</i>

13:54.417 --> 13:56.375
<i> Clanton's whole crew.</i>

14:01.166 --> 14:03.291
I think one of the things we
have to understand about Wyatt

14:03.291 --> 14:05.166
is that he was capable
of impulsive violence.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.333
<i> After his brother Morgan</i>
<i> is killed,</i>

14:10.333 --> 14:12.041
<i> he kind of snaps.</i>

14:32.959 --> 14:35.375
<i> Morgan Earp</i>
<i> was assassinated.</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:38.208
<i> This was not something</i>
<i> that just happened.</i>

14:40.208 --> 14:42.208
And Wyatt's reaction
is just as planned

14:42.208 --> 14:43.917
and just as premeditated.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.333
You give me a name,

14:46.333 --> 14:48.500
and I'll let you live.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.291
You go to hell.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.125
You first.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.542
Robert Redford:
<i> I think Wyatt Earp,</i>
<i> when he went on</i>

15:02.542 --> 15:07.291
the other side of the law,
it was really about revenge.

15:07.291 --> 15:09.417
<i> There wasn't anything</i>
<i> to justify</i>

15:09.417 --> 15:11.500
<i> or redeem the killing,</i>

15:11.500 --> 15:14.375
then it had to be
taken in the hands
of certain individuals.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.375
Narrator:
<i> After killing cowboy</i>
<i> Frank Stilwell,</i>

15:19.375 --> 15:21.417
<i> Wyatt and his gang</i>
<i> continue their hunt</i>

15:21.417 --> 15:23.500
<i> through</i>
<i> the Arizona territory,</i>

15:23.542 --> 15:26.417
<i> tracking more</i>
<i> of Ike Clanton's men,</i>

15:26.417 --> 15:28.583
<i> including Charlie Cruz.</i>

15:44.291 --> 15:45.583
Pick it up.

15:57.250 --> 16:00.333
Narrator:
<i> As Wyatt continues</i>
<i> his quest for vengeance,</i>

16:00.333 --> 16:04.001
<i> he's turning</i>
<i> from a man of justice</i>

16:04.001 --> 16:06.583
<i> to a cold-blooded killer.</i>

16:16.291 --> 16:20.291
Narrator:
<i> Jesse James has reemerged</i>
<i> from a life on the run,</i>

16:20.333 --> 16:22.375
<i> and with the help</i>
<i> of his trusted gang members</i>

16:22.375 --> 16:26.166
<i> Charlie and Robert Ford</i>

16:26.166 --> 16:30.041
<i> he has reestablished himself</i>
<i> as a feared outlaw.</i>

16:37.083 --> 16:39.500
<i> In hopes of ending</i>
<i> Jesse's crime spree,</i>

16:39.500 --> 16:41.583
<i> Missouri governor</i>
<i> Thomas Crittenden</i>

16:41.583 --> 16:45.041
<i> has put a $5,000 bounty</i>
<i> on his head.</i>

16:46.458 --> 16:49.208
<i> And it isn't long</i>

16:49.208 --> 16:52.000
<i> before the opportunity</i>
<i> he's been waiting for</i>

16:52.000 --> 16:54.041
<i> comes to him.</i>

16:55.500 --> 16:57.625
You the governor?

16:57.625 --> 17:00.417
And you must be
Robert Ford.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.500
<i>You ride</i>
<i>with Jesse James.</i>

17:08.375 --> 17:12.125
You see this $1 coin,
Mr. Ford?

17:13.417 --> 17:15.250
Well, that's you.

17:19.375 --> 17:24.208
But this $10,000 coin,

17:24.208 --> 17:26.417
that's Jesse James.

17:28.333 --> 17:31.333
A good gambler
could turn that
one dollar

17:31.333 --> 17:33.583
into 10,000.

17:36.208 --> 17:38.542
Are you a good gambler,
Mr. Ford?

17:43.709 --> 17:48.291
I want the reward
and immunity for me
and my brother.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.583
Kill Jesse James

17:50.583 --> 17:52.750
and you'll get the money.

18:00.333 --> 18:04.166
Narrator:
<i> Robert Ford knows that by</i>
<i> working with Jesse James,</i>

18:04.166 --> 18:07.333
<i> he and his brother</i>
<i> are now prime targets, too.</i>

18:09.250 --> 18:12.208
Gardner:
<i> Bob Ford decides</i>
<i> there's a big reward,</i>

18:12.208 --> 18:14.125
<i> so he had an incentive.</i>

18:14.125 --> 18:16.375
But there was a real fear
with Bob Ford.

18:16.375 --> 18:19.500
You know,
"I'm a little afraid
of Jesse James."

18:32.625 --> 18:35.166
Narrator:
<i> Now the Ford brothers</i>
<i> have to find</i>

18:35.166 --> 18:39.333
<i> the perfect opportunity</i>
<i> to make their move.</i>

18:39.333 --> 18:42.667
Eisenbach:
<i> Looking at it logically,</i>
<i> you might wonder,</i>

18:42.667 --> 18:45.750
"What was Jesse James
thinking trusting the Fords?"

18:47.458 --> 18:49.667
<i> I mean, anybody</i>
<i> can make a name for himself</i>

18:49.667 --> 18:53.583
as well as a lot of cash
by putting a bullet in his head.

18:53.583 --> 18:55.625
This is gonna be
the best one yet, boys.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.625
Easy money.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.542
Eisenbach:
<i> But you get to the point</i>

18:59.542 --> 19:01.458
<i> where you get reckless</i>
<i> because you've survived</i>

19:01.458 --> 19:03.959
<i> through all these scrapes.</i>

19:03.959 --> 19:06.417
<i> You kinda think of yourself</i>
<i> as being bulletproof.</i>

19:06.417 --> 19:09.250
And I think that
that's what happens
to Jesse James.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.625
Jesse,
your breakfast
is getting cold.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.291
No!

19:40.500 --> 19:41.792
I'm not done yet.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.959
Zee...

19:48.959 --> 19:50.959
thank you.

19:55.709 --> 19:57.792
I'm gonna go check
on those horses.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.291
That farmer's
out on his porch.

20:03.291 --> 20:07.625
You probably
don't wanna walk around
with that gun on your hip.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.333
Hmm.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.333
Yeah.

20:42.417 --> 20:43.625
( clicks )

20:55.709 --> 20:57.375
We gotta go.

20:57.375 --> 21:00.417
We gotta go.
Come on.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.542
<i> ( door opens,</i>
<i> closes )</i>

21:02.542 --> 21:04.542
Zee:
<i>Jesse! No!</i>

21:04.583 --> 21:07.417
( sobbing )
No.

21:07.417 --> 21:09.333
No!

21:09.333 --> 21:11.542
Jesse James is shot
in the back of the head

21:11.542 --> 21:14.458
by one of his own gang.

21:14.458 --> 21:16.875
<i> You know,</i>
<i> Jesse's criminal career</i>

21:16.875 --> 21:20.834
<i> came to an end</i>
<i> because of Bob Ford...</i>

21:20.834 --> 21:24.583
<i> some, you know,</i>
<i> riffraff, some boy.</i>

21:24.583 --> 21:26.667
( sobbing )

21:33.917 --> 21:36.333
Narrator:
<i> News of Jesse James' murder</i>

21:36.333 --> 21:39.458
<i> makes front-page headlines</i>
<i> across the country.</i>

21:43.917 --> 21:46.500
<i> And three days</i>
<i> after his death...</i>

21:48.709 --> 21:50.500
<i> more than 2,000 Americans</i>

21:50.500 --> 21:53.500
<i> flocked to</i>
<i> Clay County, Missouri,</i>

21:53.500 --> 21:56.500
<i> hoping for a final glimpse</i>
<i> of the outlaw legend,</i>

21:56.500 --> 21:58.542
<i> Jesse James.</i>

21:59.500 --> 22:00.834
You know, Jesse James

22:00.834 --> 22:02.834
is already a hero
to many people.

22:04.667 --> 22:08.333
<i> When he's killed,</i>
<i> he's now a martyr.</i>

22:08.333 --> 22:11.542
<i> And it's the way</i>
<i> that he's killed.</i>

22:11.542 --> 22:14.583
Had he been captured,
been tried,

22:14.583 --> 22:16.583
and had he been executed,

22:16.583 --> 22:18.375
it would have been
much different.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.875
<i> But this is</i>
<i> a collusion between</i>

22:21.875 --> 22:25.375
<i> the governor of a state</i>
<i> and a gang member</i>

22:25.375 --> 22:27.625
who shoots his leader
in the back of the head.

22:40.542 --> 22:43.001
Narrator:
<i> Robert Ford never escapes</i>
<i> his reputation</i>

22:43.001 --> 22:46.458
<i> as the man</i>
<i> who murdered Jesse James,</i>

22:46.458 --> 22:49.875
<i> and is shot down</i>
<i> in a saloon 10 years later.</i>

22:54.375 --> 22:56.458
<i> But as years go by,</i>

22:56.458 --> 23:00.000
<i> Jesse James' legend</i>
<i> only continues to grow.</i>

23:00.000 --> 23:03.917
Gardner:
<i> Jesse reaches</i>
<i> incredible new heights</i>

23:03.917 --> 23:05.625
in the American
imagination--

23:05.625 --> 23:07.792
as a hero, as a martyr

23:07.792 --> 23:12.667
<i> and as a representative</i>
<i> of the defeated South.</i>

23:12.667 --> 23:14.709
But I grew up
in Jesse James country.

23:14.709 --> 23:17.792
When I was a kid,
Jesse James was a hero.

23:19.458 --> 23:22.917
<i> Now I see Jesse</i>
<i> as a tragic consequence</i>

23:22.917 --> 23:24.917
<i> of an awful, awful war,</i>

23:24.917 --> 23:26.709
which was
a tragic consequence

23:26.709 --> 23:28.875
of an awful,
awful institution.

23:33.625 --> 23:35.750
Narrator:
<i> Jesse's story captures</i>
<i> the imaginations</i>

23:35.750 --> 23:38.500
<i> of Americans</i>
<i> across the country.</i>

23:38.500 --> 23:40.709
<i> And tales of his exploits</i>
<i> are enshrined</i>

23:40.709 --> 23:42.834
<i> in dime store novels,</i>

23:42.834 --> 23:46.959
<i> onstage, and eventually</i>
<i> in western cinema...</i>

23:49.542 --> 23:50.792
<i> leading him to become</i>

23:50.792 --> 23:52.792
<i> one of the most</i>
<i> notorious figures</i>

23:52.792 --> 23:55.583
<i> in American history.</i>

23:55.583 --> 23:58.583
Sutherland:
<i> Americans, for better,</i>
<i> and sometimes for worse,</i>

23:58.583 --> 24:00.542
truly cut their own path.

24:00.542 --> 24:01.959
And I think that
that's why we always

24:01.959 --> 24:04.792
idolize Jesse James.

24:04.792 --> 24:06.625
<i> Jesse James said,</i>
<i> I'm not gonna take this,</i>

24:06.625 --> 24:09.959
<i> and went and grabbed</i>
<i> what he wanted.</i>

24:09.959 --> 24:13.500
I think there's
a place in America's heart
for those people.

24:15.709 --> 24:18.959
Narrator:
<i> But while another</i>
<i> ruthless outlaw may be gone...</i>

24:23.834 --> 24:26.917
<i> there's still one man</i>
<i> causing chaos in the West.</i>

24:36.625 --> 24:39.667
Narrator:
<i> In the territory</i>
<i> of Arizona,</i>

24:39.667 --> 24:41.709
<i> Wyatt Earp rides</i>
<i> to avenge the murder</i>

24:41.709 --> 24:43.667
<i> of his brother, Morgan.</i>

24:45.667 --> 24:49.001
<i> Earp and his posse have killed</i>
<i> two cowboys already...</i>

24:51.001 --> 24:52.750
<i> and are now</i>
<i> hot on the trail</i>

24:52.750 --> 24:55.542
<i> of another member</i>
<i> of the gang,</i>

24:55.542 --> 24:58.166
<i> William "Curly Bill" Brocius.</i>

24:58.166 --> 25:00.625
James Caan:
<i> The code of the West, there</i>
<i> were certain things permitted,</i>

25:00.625 --> 25:02.750
<i> and there's certain things</i>
<i> that weren't permitted.</i>

25:02.750 --> 25:04.000
But there was no
law and order,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.083
and usually the guys
that kept the order,

25:06.125 --> 25:08.625
the Wyatt Earps
of the world,

25:08.625 --> 25:10.959
<i> they were</i>
<i> stone-blooded killers.</i>

25:22.709 --> 25:24.667
Come on.

25:24.709 --> 25:25.875
Whoa.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.834
<i> ( horse nickers )</i>

25:48.834 --> 25:50.667
( nickering )

25:58.001 --> 26:00.125
<i> ( horse whinnies )</i>

26:05.750 --> 26:06.917
Saddle 'em up.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.083
<i>Let's move.</i>

26:43.208 --> 26:44.959
Cowboy:
<i> You're a dead man, Wyatt!</i>

27:03.709 --> 27:06.001
Collier:
<i> Wyatt shoots Curly Bill dead.</i>

27:08.041 --> 27:09.875
<i> The heel</i>
<i> on his cowboy boot</i>

27:09.875 --> 27:12.250
<i> gets shot out</i>
<i> from underneath him.</i>

27:12.250 --> 27:14.834
He's got holes
all through his jacket.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.834
<i> He leaves</i>
<i> completely unscathed.</i>

27:19.834 --> 27:24.125
Gets his man and leaves
without a bullet hole
once again.

27:24.125 --> 27:26.792
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt and his men</i>
<i> survive the shootout,</i>

27:26.792 --> 27:30.083
<i> but after brutally executing</i>
<i> four men in two weeks,</i>

27:30.083 --> 27:33.000
<i> his actions</i>
<i> begin to make headlines.</i>

27:34.875 --> 27:37.667
<i> But instead of</i>
<i> being seen as a hero,</i>

27:37.709 --> 27:39.834
<i> he's branded an outlaw.</i>

27:39.834 --> 27:42.250
Eisenbach:
<i> You got a lot of people</i>
<i> saying, "Wait a minute.</i>

27:42.250 --> 27:46.709
This guy running around,
shooting people in cold blood?

27:46.709 --> 27:47.959
This isn't justice."

27:47.959 --> 27:49.709
<i> So the bigger issues</i>

27:49.709 --> 27:51.917
<i> of frontier law</i>
<i> versus justice</i>

27:51.917 --> 27:54.667
<i> now become wrapped up</i>
<i> in the story</i>

27:54.667 --> 27:57.000
<i> of Wyatt Earp.</i>

28:00.000 --> 28:02.709
Narrator:
<i> Authorities in Tombstone</i>
<i> assemble a posse</i>

28:02.709 --> 28:05.166
<i> to track down</i>
<i> and arrest Wyatt Earp.</i>

28:17.875 --> 28:19.875
<i> Now that he's a fugitive,</i>

28:19.875 --> 28:22.750
<i> Wyatt Earp decides</i>
<i> to give up on his hunt</i>

28:22.750 --> 28:24.750
<i> for Ike Clanton.</i>

28:24.750 --> 28:27.750
Kirschner:
<i> Wyatt finally realized</i>
<i> that he had had enough</i>

28:27.750 --> 28:31.333
and disbanded the posse
and escaped Arizona,

28:31.333 --> 28:34.250
where things were getting
mighty hot for him.

28:36.834 --> 28:39.166
Narrator:
<i> With his reputation tarnished,</i>

28:39.166 --> 28:42.208
<i> Wyatt Earp vanishes</i>
<i> from the public eye.</i>

28:44.917 --> 28:47.291
Isenberg:
<i> I think Wyatt Earp</i>
<i> is remembered less</i>

28:47.291 --> 28:50.917
<i> for being a lawman</i>
<i> than for being a vigilante.</i>

28:50.917 --> 28:53.875
What people find appealing
about the Wyatt Earp myth,

28:53.875 --> 28:57.083
what always shows up
in most of the films,

28:57.083 --> 29:00.250
<i> is that when the law</i>
<i> is unable to bring justice,</i>

29:00.291 --> 29:03.333
<i> Wyatt Earp takes the law</i>
<i> into his own hands.</i>

29:03.333 --> 29:05.792
<i> And so it's</i>
<i> as a vigilante,</i>

29:05.792 --> 29:09.000
<i> as a guy who embodies</i>
<i> a kind of higher law</i>

29:09.000 --> 29:11.291
<i> that he's most famous.</i>

29:11.291 --> 29:14.041
Eisenbach:
<i> The sad thing about Wyatt</i>
<i> is that in his heart,</i>

29:14.041 --> 29:17.750
<i> he just wanted to settle down</i>
<i> and make some money.</i>

29:17.750 --> 29:19.792
But he winds up
getting himself

29:19.792 --> 29:21.875
into one situation
after another.

29:21.875 --> 29:24.333
<i> And so he never</i>
<i> stakes down the roots</i>

29:24.333 --> 29:26.792
<i> that he wanted</i>
<i> to stake down.</i>

29:26.792 --> 29:30.250
And so we have this kind of
myth of Wyatt Earp

29:30.250 --> 29:33.792
as being the guy
who just did it on his own.

29:33.792 --> 29:36.125
<i> He was the cowboy,</i>
<i> that individual--</i>

29:36.125 --> 29:38.417
<i> that was not</i>
<i> what he wanted to be.</i>

29:40.875 --> 29:45.500
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt Earp's quest for justice</i>
<i> has come to an end.</i>

29:45.500 --> 29:48.000
<i> But the legendary lawman</i>
<i> still hasn't made</i>

29:48.000 --> 29:50.375
<i> his final mark on the West.</i>

29:58.959 --> 30:00.417
( whistle blows )

30:03.250 --> 30:06.083
<i> After returning from exile</i>
<i> in Canada,</i>

30:06.125 --> 30:07.834
<i> Lakota Chief Sitting Bull</i>

30:07.834 --> 30:09.834
<i> has been traveling</i>
<i> across America</i>

30:09.834 --> 30:12.166
<i> with Buffalo Bill Cody's</i>
<i> Wild West Show...</i>

30:14.166 --> 30:18.083
<i> hoping to preserve</i>
<i> what's left of his culture.</i>

30:31.001 --> 30:34.959
<i> But after four months</i>
<i> of touring modern cities</i>
<i> in the East,</i>

30:34.959 --> 30:37.000
<i> Sitting Bull</i>
<i> has become disheartened</i>

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
<i> by what he's seeing</i>

30:39.000 --> 30:41.291
<i> and decides</i>
<i> it's time to go home.</i>

30:41.291 --> 30:43.083
( whistle blowing )

30:45.250 --> 30:47.458
Larry Pourier:
<i> I don't know how an Indian</i>
<i> would have gone East</i>

30:47.458 --> 30:50.208
<i> and gone home</i>
<i> and felt better.</i>

30:51.875 --> 30:53.875
That has to be the most
hopeless feeling in the world,

30:53.875 --> 30:55.959
to know that your land
is now gonna look like that

30:55.959 --> 30:57.875
in about 50 years.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.208
And if you're alive
in 50 years,

31:02.208 --> 31:04.875
that's probably what you're
going to be living in.

31:19.083 --> 31:22.333
Narrator:
<i> But when Sitting Bull</i>
<i> returns to the reservation...</i>

31:27.875 --> 31:31.333
<i> he finds something</i>
<i> unexpected.</i>

31:31.333 --> 31:34.542
<i> A new movement</i>
<i> has taken hold of his people.</i>

31:38.417 --> 31:41.291
<i> A ritual that they believe</i>
<i> could restore the Lakota</i>

31:41.291 --> 31:43.917
<i> to their former way</i>
<i> of life.</i>

31:45.917 --> 31:48.083
<i> It's called</i>
<i> the "Ghost Dance."</i>

31:50.083 --> 31:52.625
Jacoby:
<i> The Ghost Dance movement</i>

31:52.625 --> 31:55.166
<i> is something that emerges</i>
<i> in the 1880s.</i>

31:55.166 --> 31:56.417
If you do these rituals,

31:56.417 --> 31:58.458
you can make time
go backwards.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.917
<i> White people</i>
<i> would disappear,</i>

32:02.917 --> 32:04.500
<i> the buffalo</i>
<i> would come back,</i>

32:04.500 --> 32:07.333
and Indian peoples
would be restored

32:07.333 --> 32:09.333
to their former prominence.

32:11.917 --> 32:14.083
<i> It's a very appealing vision.</i>

32:17.083 --> 32:20.250
Narrator:
<i> But as the movement</i>
<i> gains momentum,</i>

32:20.291 --> 32:24.208
<i> government agents fear</i>
<i> it's leading to an uprising.</i>

32:27.583 --> 32:30.500
Jacoby:
<i> A lot of the people who are</i>
<i> most active in the ghost dance</i>

32:30.500 --> 32:33.375
are difficult to get to
and so, seemingly,

32:33.375 --> 32:35.208
the reservation
authorities decide,

32:35.208 --> 32:38.041
"Instead we'll
arrest Sitting Bull

32:38.041 --> 32:39.458
<i> because he's close by,</i>
<i> he's in his cabin.</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:41.542
<i> We know where it is."</i>

32:41.542 --> 32:43.333
<i> And they decide to send</i>

32:43.333 --> 32:47.166
a recently created
Lakota police force.

32:51.417 --> 32:53.500
Narrator:
<i> In December of 1890...</i>

32:56.458 --> 32:58.500
<i> the U.S. sends</i>
<i> 40 armed guards</i>

32:58.500 --> 33:01.291
<i> to remove Sitting Bull</i>
<i> from his home.</i>

33:04.625 --> 33:06.583
<i> But the chief's followers</i>
<i> are determined</i>

33:06.583 --> 33:08.500
<i> to protect their leader.</i>

33:08.500 --> 33:10.542
( speaking
native language )

33:16.001 --> 33:17.333
Lower your weapon.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.458
( speaking
native language )

33:26.166 --> 33:28.083
I will not go!

33:50.083 --> 33:53.208
Narrator:
<i> The great Lakota chief,</i>
<i> Sitting Bull,</i>

33:53.208 --> 33:55.166
<i> who fought</i>
<i> for over 30 years</i>

33:55.166 --> 33:57.500
<i> to preserve his people's</i>
<i> way of life,</i>

33:57.500 --> 34:01.208
<i> is killed</i>
<i> at the age of 59.</i>

34:05.375 --> 34:08.041
Pourier:
<i> The death of Sitting Bull</i>

34:08.041 --> 34:11.417
<i> was the death</i>
<i> of our culture,</i>

34:11.417 --> 34:13.583
<i> at that moment.</i>

34:13.583 --> 34:16.542
We had faith in one man,

34:16.542 --> 34:19.542
and he's doing everything
he can to keep you alive

34:19.542 --> 34:21.500
and to keep your way
of life alive

34:21.500 --> 34:24.041
and to protect you,

34:24.083 --> 34:26.375
and he dies a violent death

34:26.375 --> 34:29.291
instead of a natural death.

34:32.542 --> 34:35.083
<i> You know,</i>
<i> you've lost your leader</i>

34:35.083 --> 34:37.291
<i> on top of losing everything.</i>

34:40.417 --> 34:43.208
Narrator:
<i> In the wake</i>
<i> of Sitting Bull's death,</i>

34:43.208 --> 34:46.208
<i> many of his followers</i>
<i> flee the reservation</i>

34:46.208 --> 34:49.667
<i> and set up a temporary camp</i>
<i> in South Dakota</i>

34:49.667 --> 34:52.208
<i> at a place</i>
<i> called Wounded Knee.</i>

34:53.542 --> 34:55.625
<i> But the U.S. government</i>
<i> remains fearful</i>

34:55.625 --> 34:57.500
<i> of the possible uprising</i>

34:57.500 --> 35:01.125
<i> and sends the 7th Cavalry</i>
<i> to track them down.</i>

35:01.125 --> 35:03.250
Jacoby:
<i> From the U.S. Army's</i>
<i> perspective of hostile</i>

35:03.250 --> 35:05.625
from non-hostile Indian,
is they basically decide,

35:05.625 --> 35:07.667
"Well, anyone
who's off the reservation

35:07.667 --> 35:12.166
is potentially hostile,
and we'll treat them this way."

35:12.166 --> 35:15.291
Narrator:
<i> Just two weeks</i>
<i> after Sitting Bull's murder,</i>

35:15.291 --> 35:18.417
<i> 200 more Lakota men,</i>
<i> women and children</i>

35:18.417 --> 35:22.417
<i> are killed</i>
<i> by American troops</i>
<i> at Wounded Knee.</i>

35:22.417 --> 35:24.250
Jacoby:
<i> It's a very disturbing event.</i>

35:24.250 --> 35:26.500
<i> They begin to throw in</i>
<i> these howitzer shells</i>

35:26.500 --> 35:30.583
into the encampment
at a rate of 50 shots a minute.

35:30.583 --> 35:34.250
<i> It's quite clearly</i>
<i>a disproportionate use of force</i>

35:34.250 --> 35:36.625
against a community
that was not in any way

35:36.625 --> 35:41.667
clearly, um, violent
towards the United States.

35:41.667 --> 35:44.625
Narrator:
<i> Led by General</i>
<i> James W. Forsyth,</i>

35:44.625 --> 35:47.208
<i> the massacre</i>
<i> at Wounded Knee</i>

35:47.208 --> 35:49.667
<i> is the last major attack</i>
<i> by the U.S. government</i>

35:49.667 --> 35:52.250
<i> against the Lakota people.</i>

35:52.250 --> 35:54.667
I think Wounded Knee
was so devastating

35:54.667 --> 35:58.625
that it really did kill
the spirit of a lot of people

35:58.625 --> 36:00.709
because they
were fighting something

36:00.709 --> 36:02.417
<i> that we don't agree with.</i>

36:02.417 --> 36:04.458
<i> And Wounded Knee</i>
<i> was basically the end</i>

36:04.458 --> 36:06.208
<i> of that life.</i>

36:08.500 --> 36:10.542
Narrator:
<i> For decades,</i>
<i> American Indians</i>

36:10.542 --> 36:14.417
<i> have fought to</i>
<i> keep their place</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

36:14.417 --> 36:17.417
<i> But now</i>
<i> the Indian population,</i>

36:17.417 --> 36:20.625
<i> once estimated</i>
<i> at over 300,000,</i>

36:20.625 --> 36:22.458
<i> has been cut in half.</i>

36:25.750 --> 36:30.542
Redford:
<i> Characters like</i>
<i> Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse,</i>

36:30.542 --> 36:32.208
they fought to the end.

36:32.208 --> 36:34.208
And, of course,
eventually, the end did come.

36:36.375 --> 36:41.417
Pourier:
<i> I'm honored to be</i>
<i> Sitting Bull's relative.</i>

36:41.417 --> 36:43.542
You know, we're actually
to a point now

36:43.542 --> 36:46.834
where we can survive and thrive,
so we need to do that

36:46.834 --> 36:49.375
<i> in order to honor</i>
<i> our ancestors,</i>

36:49.375 --> 36:51.291
<i> to honor Sitting Bull,</i>

36:51.291 --> 36:53.792
<i> because they didn't want</i>
<i> to lose their way of life.</i>

36:53.792 --> 36:58.208
And we fought and died
to keep our way of life,

36:58.208 --> 36:59.792
and we still have it.

37:13.750 --> 37:16.875
Narrator:
<i> By the end of</i>
<i> the 19th Century,</i>

37:16.875 --> 37:19.542
<i> outlaws like Billy the Kid</i>
<i> and Jesse James</i>

37:19.542 --> 37:23.583
<i> no longer terrorized</i>
<i> the West.</i>

37:23.583 --> 37:26.417
<i> And the war between</i>
<i> the U.S. Army and the Indians</i>

37:26.417 --> 37:28.625
<i> is effectively over.</i>

37:32.625 --> 37:35.875
<i> With the frontier</i>
<i> wide open,</i>

37:35.875 --> 37:38.834
<i> the Government frees up</i>
<i> 1.9 million acres</i>

37:38.834 --> 37:42.583
<i> of former Indian territory</i>
<i> in Oklahoma.</i>

37:44.458 --> 37:47.583
<i> And within hours,</i>
<i> 50,000 settlers</i>

37:47.583 --> 37:50.667
<i> pour into the land.</i>

37:50.667 --> 37:52.750
<i> It will come to be known</i>

37:52.750 --> 37:55.333
<i> as the "Oklahoma Land Rush."</i>

37:58.834 --> 38:01.834
<i> By 1890, the West has been</i>
<i> settled to the point</i>

38:01.834 --> 38:05.834
<i> where the U.S. Census Bureau</i>
<i> can declare the frontier</i>

38:05.834 --> 38:07.792
<i> officially closed.</i>

38:09.375 --> 38:11.625
<i> In a span</i>
<i> of just 25 years,</i>

38:11.625 --> 38:15.375
<i> America has gone from</i>
<i> a country divided by war</i>

38:15.375 --> 38:19.625
<i> to a nation</i>
<i> united by land.</i>

38:19.625 --> 38:21.625
H.W. Brands:
<i> What happened was the West</i>

38:21.625 --> 38:24.417
eventually came to look
more like the East.

38:24.417 --> 38:26.458
Before 1860,
if you went West,

38:26.458 --> 38:28.458
you dropped out of sight,

38:28.458 --> 38:30.750
and people couldn't hear
from you.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.500
<i> All of a sudden,</i>
<i> you could go through</i>

38:32.500 --> 38:34.542
<i> much of the West</i>
<i> in the 1890s,</i>

38:34.542 --> 38:37.333
<i> and you could keep almost</i>
<i> instantaneously in touch</i>

38:37.333 --> 38:39.583
<i> with what was going on</i>
<i> in the East.</i>

38:39.583 --> 38:43.667
<i> And that made all</i>
<i> the difference in the world.</i>

38:43.667 --> 38:46.542
Narrator:
<i> But while the frontier</i>
<i> has been tamed,</i>

38:46.542 --> 38:48.875
<i> there's one place</i>
<i> where the spirit of the West</i>

38:48.875 --> 38:50.792
<i> still lives on.</i>

39:07.500 --> 39:08.959
Director:<i> And cut!</i>

39:18.375 --> 39:19.834
Was that good for you?

39:20.834 --> 39:23.500
That was perfect.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.001
Narrator:
<i> Decades after</i>
<i> escaping Arizona,</i>

39:26.001 --> 39:31.583
<i> Wyatt Earp reemerges</i>
<i> in Hollywood, California,</i>

39:31.583 --> 39:34.834
<i> as a consultant in one of</i>
<i> America's newest industries--</i>

39:34.834 --> 39:38.417
<i> motion pictures.</i>

39:38.417 --> 39:39.792
Kirschner:
<i> Wyatt Earp had the advantage</i>

39:39.792 --> 39:41.834
<i> of living</i>
<i> to a ripe old age.</i>

39:41.834 --> 39:44.542
<i> He simply outlived</i>
<i> everybody else.</i>

39:44.542 --> 39:46.375
So, you know what they say,

39:46.375 --> 39:49.500
his history belongs
to the victors.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
Wyatt Earp:
We used to drive cattle
into Dodge City

39:51.500 --> 39:54.875
that would stretch
as far as the eye
can see.

39:54.875 --> 39:58.875
Thousands of cattle
coming into town.

39:58.917 --> 40:02.041
Just trample everything
in their path.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.709
Narrator:
<i> By telling stories</i>
<i> about his past,</i>

40:04.709 --> 40:08.625
<i> Wyatt Earp immortalizes</i>
<i> the Old West in film.</i>

40:08.625 --> 40:10.625
Isenberg:
<i> Wyatt Earp decides</i>
<i> that if his life</i>

40:10.625 --> 40:12.792
<i> can be made into a film</i>
<i> the way he wants it made,</i>

40:12.792 --> 40:17.041
then the legacy will be the one
that he wants remembered.

40:17.041 --> 40:19.834
And in a lot of ways,
that's exactly what happens.

40:20.041 --> 40:22.917
- First day on the job?
- Yes, sir.

40:22.917 --> 40:25.625
I'm a big admirer
of yours, Mr. Earp.

40:25.625 --> 40:28.709
Narrator:
<i> Earp even inspires</i>
<i> a young production assistant</i>

40:28.709 --> 40:31.417
<i> named Marion Morrison,</i>

40:31.417 --> 40:33.542
<i> who will go on</i>
<i> to become an actor,</i>

40:33.583 --> 40:37.500
<i> taking the stage name</i>
<i> John Wayne.</i>

40:37.500 --> 40:39.583
<i> John Wayne</i>
<i> uses Wyatt Earp</i>

40:39.583 --> 40:42.667
<i> as the model for many</i>
<i> of his Hollywood roles,</i>

40:42.667 --> 40:45.917
<i> creating an iconic image</i>
<i> of the Western hero</i>

40:45.917 --> 40:48.875
<i> and becoming one of the most</i>
<i> prominent western stars</i>

40:48.875 --> 40:50.542
<i> in movie history.</i>

40:52.000 --> 40:53.750
Danny Glover:
<i> The attachment to westerns</i>

40:53.750 --> 40:56.458
<i> were certainly,</i>
<i> I think, an important part</i>

40:56.458 --> 40:59.001
of this country's evolution,

40:59.001 --> 41:01.583
it's sense of it's identity,

41:01.583 --> 41:03.125
<i> it's sense of freedom.</i>

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
Narrator:
<i> To this day,</i>
<i> the West is remembered</i>

41:07.500 --> 41:10.792
<i> as an era of violence</i>
<i> and lawlessness</i>

41:10.792 --> 41:12.959
<i> defined by</i>
<i> larger-than-life figures</i>

41:12.959 --> 41:15.667
<i> like Jesse James,</i>
<i> Crazy Horse,</i>

41:15.667 --> 41:18.542
<i> Custer,</i>
<i> Billy the Kid,</i>

41:18.542 --> 41:21.667
<i> Sitting Bull,</i>
<i> and Wyatt Earp.</i>

41:21.667 --> 41:23.625
<i> ( woman screams )</i>

41:23.667 --> 41:25.834
Narrator:
<i> They were men who took</i>
<i> what they wanted</i>

41:25.834 --> 41:28.792
<i> and fought for</i>
<i> what they believed in.</i>

41:28.792 --> 41:31.750
Brands:
<i> The outlaws were in some ways</i>
<i> the ultimate individualists.</i>

41:31.750 --> 41:33.834
<i> No one could tell</i>
<i> the outlaws what to do.</i>

41:33.834 --> 41:35.583
A lot of Americans
could imagine,

41:35.583 --> 41:37.500
"Boy, if things
had been different,

41:37.500 --> 41:39.542
I could be as bold
and brave

41:39.583 --> 41:43.583
as daring as Jesse James
or as Billy the Kid.

41:43.583 --> 41:46.667
Tom Skerrit:
<i> The Old West engaged</i>
<i> your imagination</i>

41:46.667 --> 41:48.750
in a way nothing else
has ever done.

41:48.792 --> 41:52.959
And it really is
that eternal American figure,

41:52.959 --> 41:57.667
<i> that guy who faces adversity</i>
<i> and comes through it.</i>

41:59.583 --> 42:01.542
Narrator:
<i> The story of the West</i>
<i> is the story</i>

42:01.542 --> 42:03.917
<i> of a country</i>
<i> evolving and growing</i>

42:03.917 --> 42:07.834
<i> through the sheer will</i>
<i> and courage of its people.</i>

42:07.834 --> 42:11.083
I believe that
it is truly American

42:11.083 --> 42:14.583
<i> to strike out in a new life,</i>
<i> in a new existence.</i>

42:14.583 --> 42:18.959
<i> The hardships on those</i>
<i> individuals is amazing.</i>

42:18.959 --> 42:21.083
<i> And despite</i>
<i> all the obstacles,</i>

42:21.125 --> 42:25.041
we've populated a nation
that is now and always has been

42:25.041 --> 42:27.709
one of the great
experiments in history.
