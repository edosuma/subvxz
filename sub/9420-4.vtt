Trying to, you know, kind of

04:03.944 --> 04:05.377
Figure myself out.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.612
I'm living with my mom.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.114
I had some personal issues, so--

04:09.116 --> 04:10.649
Just, like, my father passing

04:10.651 --> 04:13.018
Away and--and my sister passed

04:13.020 --> 04:13.685
Before that.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.621

About it.

04:22.062 --> 04:22.894
My instagram.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.029
I saw a really hot guy.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.230
I really liked his posts.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.031
I found, like, similar

04:26.033 --> 04:26.932
Interests.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.400
So we mutually added one

04:28.402 --> 04:29.067
Another.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.369
He asked for my number, so i

04:30.371 --> 04:32.371
Gave it to him on a comment,

04:32.373 --> 04:33.705
And then i, like, took it down.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.841
>> last summer, had they not

04:35.843 --> 04:37.409
Introduced direct messaging

04:37.411 --> 04:38.110
Yet on instagram?

04:38.112 --> 04:39.344
>> no, so all flirting had to be

04:39.346 --> 04:40.012
Public.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.079
>> right, so you exchanged

04:41.081 --> 04:42.681
Numbers, and he started texting

04:42.683 --> 04:43.348
You?

04:43.350 --> 04:44.650
>> yeah, we've never talked to

04:44.652 --> 04:46.451

06:36.764 --> 06:38.063
Completely, like, down to here.

06:38.065 --> 06:38.864
>> oh, this is a good look.

06:38.866 --> 06:39.598
>> so--is it?

06:39.600 --> 06:40.732
>> if you've got the face,

06:40.734 --> 06:41.500
You don't need the hair.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.200
>> aww, thank you.

06:42.202 --> 06:42.934
>> you've got the face.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.737
>> oh, take a seat.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.472
>> you lived mostly, as a child,

06:47.474 --> 06:48.206
In new jersey?

06:48.208 --> 06:48.907
>> my whole life, born

06:48.909 --> 06:49.574
And raised.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.842
>> what was the first sort of

06:50.844 --> 06:52.043
Traumatic thing that happened

06:52.045 --> 06:53.912
In terms of your family?

06:53.914 --> 06:54.579
>> right before entering

06:54.581 --> 06:56.248
My senior year, my sister,

06:56.250 --> 06:59.951
She crashed on a bridge pillar

06:59.953 --> 07:01.353
And was just killed instantly,

07:01.355 --> 07:02.387
Car burst in flames

07:02.389 --> 07:03.422
And everything.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.389
>> wow.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.124
>> yeah.

07:06.126 --> 07:06.958
>> what happened to your dad?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.393
How did he pass away?

07:08.395 --> 07:09.060
>> this is the story

07:09.062 --> 07:09.761
That happened.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.429
I was in a relationship

07:10.431 --> 07:11.163
With a girl.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.230
And my parents kind of

07:12.232 --> 07:12.964
Were, like, slapping the [bleep]

07:12.966 --> 07:13.632
Out of me, like,

07:13.634 --> 07:14.299
"what the [bleep]?

07:14.301 --> 07:15.901
We didn't raise you like this.

07:15.903 --> 07:16.568
What is this?"

07:16.570 --> 07:18.403
Like, "you're not gay."

07:18.405 --> 07:19.070
She was supposed to come

07:19.072 --> 07:21.006
To my house, and we were on

07:21.008 --> 07:21.940
The way, and we were gonna go

07:21.942 --> 07:22.741
Pick her up.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.343
It was my mom, me, my sister,

07:25.345 --> 07:26.011
My brother.

07:26.013 --> 07:26.678
She was waiting for us

07:26.680 --> 07:27.946
At the train station, and she

07:27.948 --> 07:29.915
Says, "i can't come over."

07:29.917 --> 07:31.750
She was afraid of my family.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.119
So my mom was just livid.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.687
So they all leave at this point.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.156
My mom, my brother, my sister--

07:38.158 --> 07:40.759
They go home.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.127
They found my dad, like,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.929
On the floor because he had

07:43.931 --> 07:45.230
An aneurysm and a stroke

07:45.232 --> 07:46.465
At the same time.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.533
And so they said that if they

07:48.535 --> 07:50.368
Never dropped me off, that my

07:50.370 --> 07:51.770
Dad would be alive, so they

07:51.772 --> 07:53.538
Blamed me.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.873
My mom was just like,

07:54.875 --> 07:55.874
"you're a [bleep] piece

07:55.876 --> 07:56.942
Of [bleep]," you know?

07:56.944 --> 07:58.477
Basically like, "if we never

07:58.479 --> 07:59.211
Dropped you to see your

07:59.213 --> 08:01.012
Girlfriend, your father would

08:01.014 --> 08:03.482
Still be alive."

08:03.484 --> 08:04.683
And i heard that.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.617
And, like, i broke down.

08:05.619 --> 08:09.254
I com--i completely broke down.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.856
I didn't know what to do.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.023
>> why do you live there?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.492
>> i don't have anywhere else

08:13.494 --> 08:14.593
To go.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.894
>> this guy that you've been

08:15.896 --> 08:17.262
Talking to on the internet is

08:17.264 --> 08:19.130
Sort of the most tame, normal...

08:19.132 --> 08:20.131
>> and stable.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.199
>> grounded and stable thing...

08:21.201 --> 08:22.000
>> in my life, yeah.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.168
>> that you've ever had.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.269
>> he knew what to say,

08:24.271 --> 08:24.936
You know?

08:24.938 --> 08:25.604
He knew how to, you know,

08:25.606 --> 08:27.239
Measure up and deal with me

08:27.241 --> 08:27.906
Handling, like, a personal

08:27.908 --> 08:28.640
Death.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.574
>> he's been there for that.

08:29.576 --> 08:30.242
>> he's been there.

08:30.244 --> 08:31.009
>> and he's responded in ways

08:31.011 --> 08:31.676
That you needed.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.078
>> yeah, i want that just as

08:33.080 --> 08:35.313
Much in person than i do, like,

08:35.315 --> 08:38.482
Through texting.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.551
>> what do your friends think

08:39.553 --> 08:40.519
About the situation?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.919
>> they don't know what's going

08:41.922 --> 08:42.587
On completely.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.587
>> right.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.523
>> i've actually, like,

08:44.525 --> 08:46.258
Spent money on him.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.092
>> what does that mean?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.126
>> what kind of money?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.194
>> like, i've probably spent

08:49.196 --> 08:50.629
At least 2 grand worth.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.696
>> on what?

08:53.332 --> 08:54.299
Buying him gifts.

08:54.301 --> 08:54.966
>> has he ever sent you

08:54.968 --> 08:56.201
A picture of him with the stuff

08:56.203 --> 08:56.868
You've sent him?

08:56.870 --> 08:57.936
>> no, never.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.337
>> not even, like, of the stuff?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.939
>> no, he's only done it once.

09:00.941 --> 09:01.806
Like, when i sent him the

09:01.808 --> 09:03.842
Biggest box--i got him, like,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.176
A $1,000 camera.

09:05.178 --> 09:05.877
>> whoa.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.545
>> yeah.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.479
>> a camera that can do what?

09:07.481 --> 09:08.146
Take a picture?

09:08.148 --> 09:08.813
Take video of himself?

09:08.815 --> 09:09.481
>> like, take videos--yeah,

09:09.483 --> 09:10.181
Like, a canon, like, the big,

09:10.183 --> 09:10.849
Nice ones...

09:10.851 --> 09:11.516
>> what?

09:11.518 --> 09:12.183
>> that are, like, this big.

09:12.185 --> 09:12.884
>> but he knew you didn't

09:12.886 --> 09:13.552
Have money.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.219
It wasn't like...

09:14.221 --> 09:14.953
>> i've only sent him money

09:14.955 --> 09:15.720
Once.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.621
>> ooh.

09:16.623 --> 09:17.422
>> i sent him a money order

09:17.424 --> 09:18.757
Of $100.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.425
>> but he never sent you

09:20.427 --> 09:21.660
A thank-you note?

09:21.662 --> 09:22.327
>> no.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.562
When my birthday came around,

09:23.564 --> 09:24.429
I asked him to send me

09:24.431 --> 09:25.931
A birthday card, and he couldn't

09:25.933 --> 09:27.299
Even do that.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.800
So, believe me, how devastated

09:28.802 --> 09:29.467
I was.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.135
>> i mean, girl...

09:30.137 --> 09:31.136
>> come on.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.837
Wait, hold on, time out.

09:32.839 --> 09:33.939
When you buy him things,

09:33.941 --> 09:35.240
You have--you send them to him?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.207
>> yeah, in cincinnati,

09:36.209 --> 09:37.676
And i've done the phone number.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.711
It gave me a lady's name.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.580
>> that's a bad thing.

09:41.582 --> 09:42.247
>> all right, so you know

09:42.249 --> 09:44.015
This guy's hiding something.

09:44.017 --> 09:44.683
>> obviously.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.751
>> has to be.

09:48.955 --> 09:49.621
Okay.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.256
>> so that's him.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.091
He's cute.

09:53.093 --> 09:53.892
>> the good news is there are

09:53.894 --> 09:55.293
A lot of pictures here.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.561
So then, like, show us your

09:56.563 --> 09:59.097
Text messages.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.398
Here's one.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.066
I definitely see why

10:01.068 --> 10:02.100
You like him.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.501
>> [laughs]

10:03.503 --> 10:04.436
>> he said, "i'm still here,

10:04.438 --> 10:05.136
You know."

10:05.138 --> 10:05.870
You said--

10:05.872 --> 10:06.738
>> "you're only there when it's

10:06.740 --> 10:07.505
Convenient for you.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.840
Ask yourself truly, have you

10:08.842 --> 10:09.741
Been there when i needed

10:09.743 --> 10:10.675
Someone the most?"

10:10.677 --> 10:11.509
>> and he said, "we live so far

10:11.511 --> 10:13.178
Away for it to be any different,

10:13.180 --> 10:14.980
And i told you at the beginning

10:14.982 --> 10:16.147
I don't know how that was going

10:16.149 --> 10:17.515
To work, and i have a lot going

10:17.517 --> 10:20.251
On with my own [bleep] life."

10:20.253 --> 10:21.286
>> i don't really feel like

10:21.288 --> 10:22.721
Reading that message.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.555
>> can i read it?

10:23.557 --> 10:24.589
>> you can.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.256
>> "dealing with negative

10:25.258 --> 10:26.725
Emotions isn't something

10:26.727 --> 10:27.392
I handle.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.693
Darkness consumes me, and i feel

10:28.695 --> 10:29.995
Like i can't escape.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.329
I just want someone to help me,

10:31.331 --> 10:32.864
Marcus, and i guess i put you

10:32.866 --> 10:34.199
On a high expectation, and for

10:34.201 --> 10:35.500
That, i apologize."

10:35.502 --> 10:36.234
>> it's sad.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.035
>> yeah.

10:37.037 --> 10:37.902
Wait, that wasn't that long ago

10:37.904 --> 10:38.937
That you wrote that.

10:38.939 --> 10:39.871
Do you feel like he's there

10:39.873 --> 10:41.239
For you or...

10:41.241 --> 10:42.340
>> yes and no, because i don't

10:42.342 --> 10:43.742
Have that physical-ness.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.244
There's planes, cars, trains,

10:46.246 --> 10:47.278
You know, like--

10:47.280 --> 10:47.946
>> phones.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.080
>> it's sad, it's sad, like,

10:49.082 --> 10:50.315
To live like this.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.583
>> you feel, like, alone and

10:51.585 --> 10:52.784
Like--like nobody's there for

10:52.786 --> 10:53.852
You and...

10:53.854 --> 10:57.455
>> yeah, completely.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.823
>> you've had a lot of loss.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.058
You need somebody that you can

11:00.060 --> 11:02.093
Talk to, and this is that person

11:02.095 --> 11:02.761
For you.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.996
And you may have to face

11:04.998 --> 11:06.698
The reality that it may

11:06.700 --> 11:07.666
Not turn out to be the guy

11:07.668 --> 11:09.934
In the pictures, and this

11:09.936 --> 11:11.936
Relationship might have to end.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.471
>> i'd rather risk it all,

11:13.473 --> 11:14.239
Truthfully.

11:14.241 --> 11:14.906
>> then let's do it.

11:14.908 --> 11:15.573
>> let's do it.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.009
>> let's.

11:18.011 --> 11:18.877
I'm excited and nervous

11:18.879 --> 11:20.278
At the same time.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.347
>> we'll be in touch.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.082
I scrolled for 30 seconds

11:24.084 --> 11:26.084
And stopped, and it landed right

11:26.086 --> 11:28.353
On a very emotional exchange

11:28.355 --> 11:29.054
That i think is probably just

11:29.056 --> 11:30.455
One of hundreds that they've

11:30.457 --> 11:31.122
Had over the course of

11:31.124 --> 11:31.790
The last--

11:31.792 --> 11:32.557
>> i feel like that's a weekly

11:32.559 --> 11:33.224
Occurrence.

11:33.226 --> 11:33.992
>> but that is so telling

11:33.994 --> 11:34.759
To what this relationship

11:34.761 --> 11:35.427
Is for her.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.795
It's--it's this one person that

11:36.797 --> 11:39.297
She can really vent or open up

11:39.299 --> 11:39.964
To about something

11:39.966 --> 11:41.366
That's bothering her.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.167
Not talking on the phone,

11:42.169 --> 11:43.334
Like, that's just--

11:43.336 --> 11:44.102
>> that's the one thing where

11:44.104 --> 11:45.336
I'm like, "okay, well, for sure,

11:45.338 --> 11:46.638
It's not him."

11:46.640 --> 11:48.406
>> to me, it has all of the

11:48.408 --> 11:52.744
Construct of a catfish.

11:58.584 --> 12:03.154
>> step, step, skip.
>> [laughs]

12:03.156 --> 12:03.755
>> [laughs]

12:03.756 --> 12:04.355
>> all right, here we are.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.256
>> oh, i love what you've done

12:05.258 --> 12:05.990
With the place.

12:05.992 --> 12:06.658
>> thank you.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.093
Daisy and marcus.

12:08.095 --> 12:08.760
So they found each other

12:08.762 --> 12:09.594
On instagram.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.595
They started chatting,

12:10.597 --> 12:11.730
Quickly exchanged numbers.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.264
>> she disclosed her number.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.399
A person contacted her.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.300
>> right.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.302
Here's a situation where

12:17.304 --> 12:19.671
There is literally no excuse.

12:19.673 --> 12:20.605
>> he has a camera

12:20.607 --> 12:21.272
That was gifted by her.

12:21.274 --> 12:21.940
>> he's got the camera

12:21.942 --> 12:23.041
That we know he got.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.242
>> has a smartphone for social

12:24.244 --> 12:24.909
Media.

12:24.911 --> 12:25.877
He's not who he says he is.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.679
Maybe he's a woman.

12:27.681 --> 12:28.646
Maybe he's married.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.914
>> we've got a real mystery.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.882
>> we do.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.717
>> let's plug the old laptop in.

12:32.719 --> 12:33.384
>> oh.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.385
>> first let's go to the email,

12:34.387 --> 12:35.253
'cause she sent me an email

12:35.255 --> 12:36.588
With the info that we needed.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.255
Here we go.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.289
>> marcus's info.

12:38.291 --> 12:38.957
>> let's start

12:38.959 --> 12:39.791
With the phone number.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.826
Copy, paste phone number

12:41.828 --> 12:44.129
Into spokeo.

12:44.131 --> 12:44.963
Here we go.

12:44.965 --> 12:45.730
>> what if we just get something

12:45.732 --> 12:47.899
Right now?

12:47.901 --> 12:48.566
>> here's a hit.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.234
>> okay.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.068
>> the phone number

12:50.070 --> 12:51.402
Is registered to someone named

12:51.404 --> 12:52.137
Sandra.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.004
>> uh-huh.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.105
>> okay, so here's what's weird.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.207
It comes up as a home phone.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.009
She's been texting marcus

12:58.011 --> 12:58.676
At this number.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.344
>> mm-hmm.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.178
>> so we know it's a cell phone.

13:00.180 --> 13:00.845
So if it shows up

13:00.847 --> 13:02.413
As a home phone, it's usually

13:02.415 --> 13:04.182
Because it's a google voice,

13:04.184 --> 13:04.883
Or, like, an internet phone

13:04.885 --> 13:05.550
Number.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.251
>> got it.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.452
>> so that would suggest

13:07.454 --> 13:08.453
That this person--

13:08.455 --> 13:09.287
>> is being sneaky.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.188
>> because they're either not

13:10.190 --> 13:11.322
In cincinnati and they wanted

13:11.324 --> 13:12.524
A cincinnati area code 'cause

13:12.526 --> 13:13.525
You can select your area code

13:13.527 --> 13:15.226
Anywhere

13:15.228 --> 13:16.694
Or they have a second phone.

13:16.696 --> 13:17.362
>> do people do that?

13:17.364 --> 13:18.029
>> yes.

13:18.031 --> 13:18.797
>> oh, my god.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.764
>> they do.

13:19.766 --> 13:20.865
Let's see if we can just find

13:20.867 --> 13:22.433
Sandra on peoplesmart.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.969
Oh, there's a sandra who has

13:24.971 --> 13:26.237
A relationship to a marcus.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.906
>> to three boys, three boys.

13:27.908 --> 13:28.606
>> wow, matthew and william.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.474
>> these are her sons.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.275
Wait, that's probably his mom.

13:30.277 --> 13:30.942
>> this is great, yeah.

13:30.944 --> 13:31.976
This is great.

13:31.978 --> 13:32.744
I mean, almost for sure,

13:32.746 --> 13:33.611
This is the guy.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.379
And it would make sense

13:34.381 --> 13:35.046
That his phone number's

13:35.048 --> 13:35.880
Registered to his mom.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.048
>> under his mom.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.116
>> family plan.

13:38.118 --> 13:38.950
>> yeah.

13:38.952 --> 13:39.651
>> here we go.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.318
We got marcus,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.020
And he can be clicked on.

13:42.022 --> 13:42.720
>> oh, my gosh.

13:42.722 --> 13:43.388
>> here we go, opening a new

13:43.390 --> 13:44.889
Tab with marcus's

13:44.891 --> 13:46.858
Peoplesmart info.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.892
>> this is--25.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.194
>> wow, marcus, age 25.

13:49.196 --> 13:49.994
>> that's great.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.029
>> this is incredible.

13:51.031 --> 13:51.996
We now know his full name.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.199
We probably got his mom's name.

13:54.201 --> 13:54.933
>> we've got siblings,

13:54.935 --> 13:55.934
We've got a dad, we've got--

13:55.936 --> 13:56.835
>> i got to say, this is all

13:56.837 --> 13:58.236
Actually kind of amazingly good.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.537
What we don't know is, is the

13:59.539 --> 14:01.172
Instagram page that he's using,

14:01.174 --> 14:02.207
Which does not say his name

14:02.209 --> 14:03.508
Is marcus, is that him?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.709
>> does it not say that?

14:04.711 --> 14:05.677
>> no, it just says--doesn't--

14:05.679 --> 14:07.078
I don't think it has a--oh,

14:07.080 --> 14:08.112
That's his last name.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.448
Wait, then this is him.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.018
But why wouldn't he talk to her?

14:14.020 --> 14:14.986
Wait a second.

14:14.988 --> 14:15.820
>> what?

14:15.822 --> 14:17.388
>> it is this simple.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.289
Marcus is the guy in the

14:18.291 --> 14:18.957
Pictures.

14:18.959 --> 14:19.824
This is his instagram account.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.559
He is a videographer.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.360
It's just not who she's

14:22.362 --> 14:23.528
Talking to.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.696
Some random person saw

14:24.698 --> 14:25.530
Her number on a photo

14:25.532 --> 14:27.165
That she posted it on

14:27.167 --> 14:28.633
And has been texting her.

14:28.635 --> 14:29.567
Marcus is a real dude.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.235
>> yeah.

14:30.237 --> 14:30.902
>> she's just never

14:30.904 --> 14:31.569
Talked to him.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.237
>> oh, my god.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.004
>> she's been talking to some

14:33.006 --> 14:34.539
Rando guy or girl.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.406
>> i think it's somebody close

14:35.408 --> 14:36.074
To him.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.375
>> the fact that the phone

14:37.377 --> 14:38.910
Number is connected to the

14:38.912 --> 14:39.677
Family...

14:39.679 --> 14:40.345
>> right.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.247
>> implies that somebody--

14:42.249 --> 14:42.914
>> something is happening

14:42.916 --> 14:44.282
Within that house.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.817
I think it's the brother.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.285
Older brother

14:47.287 --> 14:48.219
Resents his younger brother

14:48.221 --> 14:49.320
For how he gets all the parent''

14:49.322 --> 14:50.321
Attention.

14:50.323 --> 14:50.989
He's not getting any

14:50.991 --> 14:52.223
Girlfriends.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.157
Now he's using his little

14:53.159 --> 14:55.727
Brother to finally get a girl.

14:55.729 --> 14:56.895
>> but why wouldn't he talk

14:56.897 --> 14:57.795
To her?

14:57.797 --> 14:59.063
>> 'cause who knows if he'll

14:59.065 --> 15:00.398
Slip up, i don't know.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.699
>> it's not a coincidence

15:01.701 --> 15:02.734
That the phone number she's

15:02.736 --> 15:04.269
Texting is registered to sandra

15:04.271 --> 15:06.237
[bleep], who is maybe

15:06.239 --> 15:07.639
Marcus's mom.

15:07.641 --> 15:08.740
>> what if it's the mom?

15:08.742 --> 15:09.407
>> what if it's the mom?

15:09.409 --> 15:12.377
>> what if...

15:12.379 --> 15:13.511
Scandal.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.546
>> and that would be really bad.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.981
>> yeah, i--the biggest reason

15:16.983 --> 15:17.849
For somebody to not talk to her

15:17.851 --> 15:19.384
On the phone is it's his mom.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.151
>> wow, okay, so hold on

15:20.153 --> 15:20.818
A second.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.086
So let's just recap.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.422
Against all odds, marcus seems

15:24.424 --> 15:25.723
To actually be the guy in the

15:25.725 --> 15:27.258
Pictures of the instagram

15:27.260 --> 15:29.294
That she is talking to.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.663
Here's what's not checking out.

15:31.665 --> 15:32.563
The guy that she's been texting

15:32.565 --> 15:33.231
With--

15:33.233 --> 15:33.898
>> the person she's been

15:33.900 --> 15:34.565
Texting with.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.366
>> the person she's been texting

15:35.368 --> 15:37.502
With sends her very few photos,

15:37.504 --> 15:38.703
Never including his--his or her

15:38.705 --> 15:39.971
Face and won't talk to daisy

15:39.973 --> 15:40.638
On the phone.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.406
>> mm-hmm.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.274
>> so that leaves a few

15:43.276 --> 15:45.410
Interesting possibilities.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.945
There is still a chance

15:46.947 --> 15:48.813
That daisy is actually talking

15:48.815 --> 15:50.515
Or texting with marcus,

15:50.517 --> 15:51.449
This guy.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.817
He's just a flaky, lazy...

15:52.819 --> 15:53.484
>> rude.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.585
>> but emotionally supportive

15:54.587 --> 15:55.253
Guy.

15:55.255 --> 15:55.987
>> whatever.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.522
>> possibility two, somebody

15:57.524 --> 15:58.389
In his family--

15:58.391 --> 15:59.057
>> yikes.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.558
>> maybe a brother, maybe the

16:00.560 --> 16:02.360
Mom saw that she posted her

16:02.362 --> 16:03.594
Phone number and somehow

16:03.596 --> 16:05.063
Intercepted and started

16:05.065 --> 16:06.297
Texting her, and she never

16:06.299 --> 16:06.998
Looked back.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.665
>> whoa.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.700
>> if it's somebody in that

16:08.702 --> 16:11.102
Family, then in a weird way,

16:11.104 --> 16:12.036
It's very similar to what

16:12.038 --> 16:12.704
Happened to me.

16:12.706 --> 16:13.371
>> right.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.205
>> because a woman was taking

16:14.207 --> 16:16.207
All of the details about her

16:16.209 --> 16:18.409
Daughter and her older daughter

16:18.411 --> 16:19.477
And kind of putting it all

16:19.479 --> 16:20.411
Together to make the ideal

16:20.413 --> 16:21.679
Version of herself a lot.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.381
>> which would be a huge blow

16:23.383 --> 16:24.849
To marcus and to daisy.

16:24.851 --> 16:25.516
>> right.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.919
>> this could be the biggest

16:27.921 --> 16:29.153
Family betrayal this show has

16:29.155 --> 16:30.989
Ever seen.

16:34.727 --> 16:39.063
>> all right, here we go.
[phone line rings]

16:39.065 --> 16:39.731
[phone line rings]

16:39.732 --> 16:40.398

32:07.359 --> 32:08.025
>> hi.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.093
>> hey, what's up, man?

32:10.095 --> 32:10.794
>> yeah, can we--can we put a

32:10.796 --> 32:11.461
Microphone on you?

32:11.463 --> 32:13.397
>> this is pretty weird.

32:13.399 --> 32:14.298
[laughter]

32:14.300 --> 32:16.967
>> you're telling me.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.835
>> thank you for meeting us.

32:18.837 --> 32:21.138
I know there were some concerns.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.406
We're all very happy that you

32:22.408 --> 32:24.474
Showed up.

32:27.378 --> 32:28.845
>> having made three seasons

32:28.847 --> 32:31.815
Of the show, i am very surprised

32:31.817 --> 32:33.183
To see you.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.352
>> i just, like, a real...

32:35.354 --> 32:36.520
I don't know, like, i have

32:36.522 --> 32:37.921
A comfort zone, and i don't

32:37.923 --> 32:39.489
Usually tend to go out of my

32:39.491 --> 32:41.258
Comfort zone.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.826
Sometimes that's just how i

32:42.828 --> 32:44.695
Handle stuff, so it took a

32:44.697 --> 32:45.862
While, you know what i mean?

32:45.864 --> 32:47.197
>> and now we're here.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.532
>> what was the reason that you

32:48.534 --> 32:49.900
Guys hadn't ever talked on

32:49.902 --> 32:50.701
The phone?

32:50.703 --> 32:51.368
>> uh...

32:51.370 --> 32:52.636
>> that's pretty weird.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.738
>> that's on me, 100%.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.206
My comfort's, like, texting,

32:56.208 --> 32:58.408
And, i don't know, just, like,

32:58.410 --> 33:01.311
A lot of my real close family

33:01.313 --> 33:02.446
Gets mad at me 'cause texting

33:02.448 --> 33:03.647
Is just kind of like,

33:03.649 --> 33:05.515
I'm comfortable with.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.017
She got mad at me, but...

33:07.019 --> 33:08.652
>> i was more than mad.

33:08.654 --> 33:09.886
Why wouldn't you have answered,

33:09.888 --> 33:10.921
Though?

33:10.923 --> 33:11.855
Even if it's your comfort zone,

33:11.857 --> 33:12.622
Like, you couldn't even just

33:12.624 --> 33:13.623
Say, "hey, like, i can't talk

33:13.625 --> 33:16.093
Right now"?

33:16.095 --> 33:17.594
Was that difficult, to even

33:17.596 --> 33:18.996
Just say, like, three words?

33:18.998 --> 33:20.964
>> right, but some of the times,

33:20.966 --> 33:21.765
Like, i don't know.

33:21.767 --> 33:22.432
Like, it just--

33:22.434 --> 33:23.233
>> but then you prolonged it

33:23.235 --> 33:23.900
For two years.

33:23.902 --> 33:24.568
>> yeah.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.003
>> i'm--i'm sorry.

33:26.005 --> 33:28.372
That's, like, not really

33:28.374 --> 33:29.272
My thing.

33:29.274 --> 33:29.940
>> let me ask you this.

33:29.942 --> 33:30.874
Why would you never send me

33:30.876 --> 33:31.775
Something back when i have asked

33:31.777 --> 33:32.476
You?

33:32.478 --> 33:33.677
Even, like, for just a simple

33:33.679 --> 33:35.078
Birthday card?

33:35.080 --> 33:37.481
>> but i told you from the

33:37.483 --> 33:38.982
Beginning, like, i'd accept

33:38.984 --> 33:39.983
Your gifts, like i--i kind--

33:39.985 --> 33:40.751
>> okay, yeah, you can't even

33:40.753 --> 33:41.418
Spend a dollar?

33:41.420 --> 33:42.085
>> i'm kind of in a--

33:42.087 --> 33:42.853
>> you couldn't even go to the

33:42.855 --> 33:43.587
Dollar store and get a birthday

33:43.589 --> 33:44.254
Card?

33:44.256 --> 33:44.921
>> it's not about that.

33:44.923 --> 33:45.856
>> and 35¢ for a stamp

33:45.858 --> 33:46.990
And an envelope?

33:46.992 --> 33:48.392
>> i told you from the beginning

33:48.394 --> 33:49.926
I appreciate everything you

33:49.928 --> 33:52.629
Send me, and i told you a couple

33:52.631 --> 33:53.964
Of times that you shouldn't

33:53.966 --> 33:55.265
Send me this because i don't

33:55.267 --> 33:56.099
Feel comfortable...

33:56.101 --> 33:56.767
>> what do you mean?

33:56.769 --> 33:58.435
>> with taking all of this.

33:58.437 --> 33:59.569
I can't send you anything

33:59.571 --> 34:00.437
In return.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.238
>> what do you mean when you say

34:01.240 --> 34:04.541
"i--i can't send you anything"?

34:04.543 --> 34:05.542
>> for a while, it was just

34:05.544 --> 34:06.777
Financially.

34:06.779 --> 34:07.444
>> but i mean, like,

34:07.446 --> 34:08.110
A postcard.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.012
That's literally, like,

34:09.014 --> 34:10.112
Maybe $2.

34:10.114 --> 34:11.848
>> yeah, like, you know?

34:11.850 --> 34:12.748
>> i'm sorry, i didn't know

34:12.751 --> 34:14.583
That really meant something

34:14.585 --> 34:16.018
To you, is a postcard.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.387
Like, i thought that me and you

34:17.389 --> 34:20.590
Were, like...Cool.

34:20.592 --> 34:21.358
>> i still feel like there's

34:21.360 --> 34:22.525
A chance that we're not getting

34:22.527 --> 34:23.260
The whole story right now,

34:23.262 --> 34:23.927
Like--

34:23.929 --> 34:24.928
>> what do you mean?

34:24.929 --> 34:26.663
>> are you dating somebody?

34:26.665 --> 34:29.933
>> no, i'm not dating anybody.

34:29.935 --> 34:30.833
>> you never sent her, like,

34:30.835 --> 34:33.804
A picture or a little video or

34:33.806 --> 34:34.971
Anything, and i keep waiting

34:34.973 --> 34:35.871
For, like, somebody else to get

34:35.873 --> 34:37.074
Out of that car and be like,

34:37.076 --> 34:38.507
"this is really me."

34:38.510 --> 34:39.943
>> we met off instagram, and,

34:39.945 --> 34:41.043
Like, that's really my

34:41.045 --> 34:42.012
Instagram.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.213
>> but if you're so comfortable

34:43.215 --> 34:45.148
Texting, you must text pictures,

34:45.150 --> 34:45.815
Right?

34:45.818 --> 34:47.417
>> but it's more like i send

34:47.418 --> 34:49.052
Pictures of, like, my work.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.353
Like, that's, like, what i like

34:50.355 --> 34:51.021
To do.

34:51.023 --> 34:52.989
I don't like to just be like--

34:52.991 --> 34:53.889
You know what i mean?

34:53.891 --> 34:54.891
I like pictures.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.827
I like getting pictures.

34:56.829 --> 34:58.995
But i'm just not, like, a--

34:58.997 --> 34:59.663
>> you like getting her

34:59.665 --> 35:00.330
Pictures?

35:00.332 --> 35:02.299
>> 'cause--yeah, i do.

35:02.301 --> 35:05.368
>> everything that daisy knows

35:05.370 --> 35:06.636
About you is legit.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.838
>> i'm really me.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.306
I'm really who i say i am.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.942
This is so weird.

35:11.944 --> 35:12.609
>> stop.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.510
>> i don't know, it's just funny

35:13.512 --> 35:14.945
That she's real, i guess.

35:14.947 --> 35:15.812
>> so y'all didn't think she

35:15.814 --> 35:16.546
Would be real?

35:16.548 --> 35:17.614
>> are you serious?

35:17.616 --> 35:18.281
>> you know, you just never

35:18.283 --> 35:18.949
Know.

35:18.951 --> 35:19.683
I know he's real.

35:19.685 --> 35:20.450
>> well, we definitely didn't

35:20.452 --> 35:21.585
Think you were real.

35:21.587 --> 35:22.285
>> you didn't?

35:22.287 --> 35:22.953
>> no.

35:22.955 --> 35:23.887
>> no, i mean...

35:23.889 --> 35:25.455
>> now it all comes full circle.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.756
>> like, you're next to me

35:26.758 --> 35:28.658
Right now, like, oh, my god.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.860
Oh, my god.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.061
>> i feel like, since things

35:31.063 --> 35:32.629
Seem to be going pretty well,

35:32.631 --> 35:34.531
Why don't we go to, like,

35:34.533 --> 35:37.501
A more comfortable place?

35:37.503 --> 35:38.335
>> all right, yeah, that's cool.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.069
>> does that work for you guys?

35:39.071 --> 35:40.103
>> yeah, that's cool.

35:40.105 --> 35:40.971
>> we'll see you in a few

35:40.973 --> 35:42.772
Minutes.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.141
>> okay.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.408
>> that just happened.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.277
That's mind-warping.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.478
>> what do you think?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.046
>> wow, he's sexy as [bleep].

35:50.048 --> 35:50.714
>> that's insane.

35:50.716 --> 35:51.748
I mean, i didn't want to say

35:51.750 --> 35:53.817
It, but, like, girl...

35:55.520 --> 35:57.087
>> he's just a little shy.

35:57.089 --> 35:57.754
>> a lot of shy.

35:57.756 --> 35:58.622
>> i mean, a lot of shy.

35:58.624 --> 35:59.723
>> a lot, yeah.

35:59.725 --> 36:00.457
>> we will have to just see

36:00.459 --> 36:01.658
What happens.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.230
>> this episode of <i> catfish:</i>

36:07.232 --> 36:10.033
<i>The tv show</i> continues now.

36:13.905 --> 36:14.905
>> today's been such a good day.

36:14.907 --> 36:16.139
>> i know, right?

36:16.141 --> 36:17.874
>> i'm truly surprised.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.442
>> i'm, like, nervous, though.

36:19.444 --> 36:20.177
>> why are you nervous?

36:20.179 --> 36:21.044
>> 'cause, i don't know, like,

36:21.046 --> 36:22.913
What to say.

36:22.915 --> 36:23.713
I don't want to, like, come off

36:23.715 --> 36:24.381
Like--

36:24.383 --> 36:25.048
>> you've got charm.

36:25.050 --> 36:25.715
>> do i?

36:25.717 --> 36:26.383
>> just be you.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.584
If you had your ideal situash,

36:27.586 --> 36:28.952
Would you kiss?

36:28.954 --> 36:29.719
>> i hope so.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.921
>> would you cuddle?

36:30.923 --> 36:31.955
>> i want to.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.490
I cuddle so hard.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.258
>> the jitters are out, like--

36:35.260 --> 36:36.226
>> i mean, i'm still...

36:36.228 --> 36:36.927
>> you're still nervous?

36:36.929 --> 36:37.594
>> just as nervous.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.328
>> he hasn't even seen your

36:38.330 --> 36:39.396
Beautiful eyes yet.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.263
>> i know, so i want to keep

36:40.265 --> 36:40.964
My glasses on.

36:40.966 --> 36:41.631
>> no.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.299
>> no, you should let him--

36:42.301 --> 36:42.966
>> you should have a grand

36:42.968 --> 36:44.701
Reveal.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.269
>> both: Whoa.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.070
>> did you see that?

36:47.072 --> 36:47.737
>> i felt something.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.606
>> oh, my god.

36:49.608 --> 36:52.609
>> oh, girl, you crack me up.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.443
>> some coffee with a little

36:53.445 --> 36:54.110
Soy milk.

36:54.112 --> 36:54.811
>> thank you so much.

36:54.813 --> 36:55.979
>> thank you.

36:55.981 --> 36:56.713
All right.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.814
The thing to keep in mind

36:57.816 --> 36:59.449
Before he gets here is that he

36:59.451 --> 37:01.351
Clearly takes things slow.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.018
>> yeah.

37:02.020 --> 37:02.852
>> and even if you guys are

37:02.854 --> 37:04.087
Feeling excited about seeing

37:04.089 --> 37:05.589
Each other, like--

37:05.591 --> 37:06.323
>> don't freak him out.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.190
>> right.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.592
>> 'cause this is a lot already

37:08.594 --> 37:09.259
For anybody.

37:09.261 --> 37:09.926
>> right.

37:09.928 --> 37:10.594
>> right?

37:10.596 --> 37:12.062
>> i wonder what he's gonna say.

37:12.064 --> 37:12.829
>> oh, wait, here he is.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.231
>> speak of the devil.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.099
>> [laughs]

37:16.101 --> 37:16.967
>> good to see you again.

37:16.969 --> 37:17.634
Have a seat.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.702
>> chill.

37:18.704 --> 37:19.703
>> i can't believe this is

37:19.705 --> 37:21.938
Happening.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.140
This is wild.

37:24.142 --> 37:25.208
>> it's definitely pretty

37:25.210 --> 37:27.711
Different.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.246
>> we're gonna give you all the

37:29.248 --> 37:31.147
Space you need.

Bye, guys.

>> see you.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.918
>> bye.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.386
You have really nice eyes.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.555
>> thank you. You do too.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.423
They're big and bright.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.092
>> are they?

37:42.094 --> 37:43.326
I can't believe, like, you're

37:43.328 --> 37:44.861
In my face, though.

37:44.863 --> 37:45.762
>> right?

37:45.764 --> 37:46.429
>> do you know what you mean

37:46.431 --> 37:49.299
To me?

37:49.301 --> 37:50.700
>> yeah, what do you mean?

37:50.702 --> 37:51.735
>> it's obvious that i really

37:51.737 --> 37:53.870
Like you and that you mean

37:53.872 --> 37:55.272
Something so special to me.
