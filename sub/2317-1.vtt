Hey, Robbo.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.755
What's the story?

03:54.042 --> 03:56.545
We got a truckie pull up
to check his trailers.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.836
Heard a wild dog growlin'
from here under the bridge.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.135
Smelt somethin' rotten.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.843
How'd he know it was a wild dog?

04:05.917 --> 04:08.966
Guess he just knows the
difference, I s'pose, you know,

04:09.083 --> 04:12.417
between a wild dog
and a... wild kind of normal dog.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.378

I've cleared off all
the dust off the truck.

let himself, mate.

04:53.417 --> 04:54.919
Are these your footprints?

04:55.667 --> 04:57.510
Yeah, I guess they are.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.378
So the other ones there
belong to the truck driver.

05:01.917 --> 05:04.090
Why isn't this crime scene
locked off?

05:04.583 --> 05:07.462
I didn't think we'd worry
about it out here, Jay.

05:07.917 --> 05:09.794
It's the middle of nowhere.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.092
So, you know her?

05:13.792 --> 05:15.214
Yeah.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.593
She's a local girl.

05:18.958 --> 05:21.461
I'll send a car out, then, eh?
Nah.

05:23.167 --> 05:24.714
I better do it myself.

05:39.542 --> 05:40.885
How's it going, Jim?

05:42.125 --> 05:45.550
Nice to see you back, Detective.

05:53.042 --> 05:56.046
Laceration to the throat,
consistent with a knife wound.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.343
Capable of causing death.

06:00.042 --> 06:02.044
Time of death, oh...

06:02.167 --> 06:05.171
48 to 72 hours ago.

06:05.917 --> 06:08.670
And it probably wasn't here.

06:11.250 --> 06:14.003
A few post-trauma wounds
around the upper arm.

06:14.125 --> 06:17.254
Probably canine in origin.

06:17.375 --> 06:21.585
Yeah. Truckie said he heard
a dog growling in here.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.965
Big bastard, was he?

06:24.208 --> 06:25.505
The dog, I mean.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.131
I don't know.
He didn't see it.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.423
But he said it was a wild one.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.674
How did he know
it was a wild dog, Jay?

06:38.625 --> 06:42.710
I was, uh... I was reading
about wild dogs.

06:43.042 --> 06:46.842
They were terrorising a town
in Russia or someplace.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.961
The people were too scared
to go out at night.

06:50.167 --> 06:51.669
Get this...

06:51.792 --> 06:55.126
the dogs had learnt
to travel on the subway.

06:55.542 --> 06:59.376
They'd take the late-night trains
into the city and scavenge for food,

06:59.500 --> 07:01.753
and then take the early
morning train back out.

07:02.292 --> 07:03.714
Can you believe that?

07:03.875 --> 07:06.094
Dogs taking trains.

07:07.042 --> 07:10.376
It's a crazy world,
getting crazier.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.548
What've you got there, Jim?

07:19.042 --> 07:21.886

down there in the smoke.

08:15.833 --> 08:18.086
Her name's Julie Mason.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.215

08:24.583 --> 08:27.917

I've had nothing like this.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.585
I know, Jay.

08:31.958 --> 08:34.962
But sooner or later,
you were gonna get it.

08:35.167 --> 08:37.885
I guess today's your lucky day.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.710

08:42.082 --> 08:46.213

stuffed under the highway.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.006

09:29.125 --> 09:30.251

09:34.000 --> 09:35.217

need your help, I'll let you know.

is definitely from the
