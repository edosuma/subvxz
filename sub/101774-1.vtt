02:18.514 --> 02:20.280
Mind if I sit?

02:20.282 --> 02:22.516
No sweat. Go for it.

02:24.052 --> 02:27.554
Aren't, uh, you three
usually with a fourth?

02:27.556 --> 02:29.289
Jean. He's talking about Jean.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.524
Thank you, detective.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.760
To what do we owe this honor,
Hobey Delmore?

02:33.762 --> 02:35.529
Have you seen Jean, Hobey?

02:35.531 --> 02:37.074
No, I haven't.

02:37.076 --> 02:38.619
Gee, because we're a little
worried, to be honest.

02:38.621 --> 02:40.165
We're not worried,
we're concerned.

02:40.168 --> 02:41.968
Concerned. Yes, yes. Concerned.

02:41.970 --> 02:45.138
Uh, we're concerned.
Yeah. Gee, we really are.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.889
Well, when did you see her last?

02:46.891 --> 02:48.641
She ditched us at the beginning
of the football game,

02:48.644 --> 02:50.810
but she's been cutting games
for weeks.

02:50.812 --> 02:52.344
We never knew where she went,

02:52.346 --> 02:53.879
but she'd always show up
by this time of day.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.949
Why are you telling this
to Hobey Delmore?

02:55.951 --> 02:57.817
It's not like
he's a goody-two-shoes, Lenore.

02:57.819 --> 02:59.886
He knows all about
this kind of thing.

03:00.689 --> 03:04.224
Trouble. She means trouble.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.826
Maybe I can help so that Jean
doesn't get in any.

03:06.828 --> 03:08.978
Her parents are tightwads.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.131
Sometimes Jean drinks.
They would go ape shit.

03:11.133 --> 03:13.800
Maybe the four of us
could set up a search party.

03:13.802 --> 03:17.971
I find your interest incredibly
suspicious, Hobey Delmore.

03:17.973 --> 03:19.306
Why?

03:19.308 --> 03:20.941
One of you can stay
in Jean's room

03:20.943 --> 03:22.525
in case she comes back, yeah?

03:22.527 --> 03:24.110
I'm in the same house
I can do that.

03:24.112 --> 03:26.212
Good.

03:26.214 --> 03:28.315
Maybe two of us could look
around the edges of campus.

03:28.317 --> 03:29.732
I know the ground was icy today,

03:29.734 --> 03:31.150
maybe she slipped
and broke an ankle.

03:31.153 --> 03:32.852
What about you?

03:33.255 --> 03:35.171
I'll check the woods.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.090
You're not scared of the man
in the woods at all?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.792
Oh, please,
a boogeyman nightmare

03:38.794 --> 03:41.227
for misbehaving six-year-olds.

03:41.229 --> 03:43.663
But why would you wanna do this
for someone you don't even know.

03:43.665 --> 03:45.848
Take his help, Lenore. Jeez.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.034
I have to admit,
I find it curious, Hobey.

03:50.639 --> 03:52.639
Maybe Jean has a boyfriend.

03:52.641 --> 03:55.275
But Jean doesn't have
a boyfriend.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.280
I'm the boyfriend
she doesn't have.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.615
Jean and I are going steady.

04:03.251 --> 04:04.884
She mentioned she had
a secret Valentine.

04:04.886 --> 04:06.353
I thought she was kidding.

04:07.022 --> 04:08.221
I call bull.

04:08.223 --> 04:09.566
It's pretty common knowledge

04:09.568 --> 04:10.911
that you're strictly
a cheerleader man.

04:10.913 --> 04:12.257
Lenore, try shutting your face.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.294
No, that's okay. Lenore's right.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.161
I was... I was plastic.

04:16.164 --> 04:20.333
I was moronic
but then I met Jean and...

04:20.334 --> 04:22.302
- She's amazing.
- Precisely.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.904
So why have you kept it secret?

04:24.906 --> 04:28.775
Uh, my notoriety wouldn't work
for her parents, you know.

04:28.777 --> 04:31.177
Also she was scared
of your opinion.

04:31.179 --> 04:34.047
She was working up
the courage, but...

04:34.049 --> 04:36.182
I already told
my best friend E.W. weeks ago.

04:36.184 --> 04:37.317
It doesn't add up.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.985
It does to me.

04:41.023 --> 04:43.023
We don't have time
to break out a lie detector.

04:43.025 --> 04:45.158
Jean could be getting frostbite.

04:47.929 --> 04:50.830
Did you kill all these beasts
yourself, sir?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.066
Sometimes
with a little native help

04:53.068 --> 04:56.336
but, yes, they are my kills.

04:58.807 --> 05:00.340
Extremely impressive.

05:05.414 --> 05:08.948
Huh! Is this you and Roosevelt?

05:08.950 --> 05:11.951
The one next to that
is me and Truman.

05:11.953 --> 05:13.836
Both photos were taken

05:13.838 --> 05:15.722
at the Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania.

05:15.724 --> 05:19.392
Where, by the way,
I met your father.

05:21.797 --> 05:24.397
Yeah.

05:24.399 --> 05:27.000
And then, the next one down
is also at the Lodge

05:27.002 --> 05:31.071
celebrating after we beat
Allentown 22 to 11.

05:31.339 --> 05:32.839
I was safety.

05:32.841 --> 05:35.208
Red Damon was fullback.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.977
You guys won undefeated
your senior year.

05:37.979 --> 05:39.813
You might be too.

05:39.815 --> 05:43.249
Even without Hobey Delmore
at quarterback.

05:44.986 --> 05:48.254
Hobey had an okay arm
but he was bad for morale.

05:48.256 --> 05:51.091
My whole opinion, we're
better off without the guy.

05:51.093 --> 05:53.193
You better be better off.

05:53.195 --> 05:55.995
I brought in
as many thick giants as I could

05:55.997 --> 05:58.198
to help bolster the defense.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.268
It hasn't exactly made me
popular in the teacher's lounge.

06:02.270 --> 06:05.872
Well, we're extremely grateful
for the reinforcements, sir.

06:05.874 --> 06:07.407
It's been night and day.

06:09.344 --> 06:13.146
They say, it's cold weather

06:14.216 --> 06:16.349
but as a true sportsman,

06:17.352 --> 06:21.755
I'm sure it just makes
your cast itch more.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.190
I've been where you are.

06:24.526 --> 06:27.260
Ready to go.

06:27.262 --> 06:32.232
Wandering around the memorial
wing can get awfully boring.

06:32.234 --> 06:37.070
Even cute girls and mashed
potatoes can get dull.

06:41.910 --> 06:45.812
How long until
you can play again, son.

06:45.814 --> 06:47.380
Full contact?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.816
Coach says a couple more weeks

06:50.818 --> 06:53.185
but in a couple of weeks, there
will only be one game left.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.526
The doctor you set me up with...

06:59.528 --> 07:02.028
- Dr. Fancher?
- Right.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.430
He gave me a bunch
of painkillers

07:04.432 --> 07:06.166
something called Dianabol.

07:06.168 --> 07:08.268
One pill after every meal,
he said.

07:08.270 --> 07:11.437
It's for building muscle but it
also helps with recovery time.

07:12.507 --> 07:14.390
I feel great.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.276
If you gave me a saw,
I'll be out there tomorrow, sir.

07:16.444 --> 07:18.077
Fine.

07:18.079 --> 07:21.080
We'll get the cast off
this week then.

07:21.082 --> 07:24.284
I'll make another appointment
for you with Fancher.

07:24.286 --> 07:26.052
He can do anything.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.355
You mentioned Red Damon.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.326
What do you know about him?

07:34.429 --> 07:35.911
Indian.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.396
He's got the rushing record
I'm going for.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.399
What else?

07:40.101 --> 07:41.334
Um...

07:41.336 --> 07:44.838
Well, his picture
is impossible to find.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.372
It's not in any
of the display cases.

07:46.374 --> 07:48.508
I heard he was somewhat
impressive though.

07:49.511 --> 07:53.279
He could tap dance around,
if that's what you mean.

07:53.281 --> 07:56.616
But so can I at Split End,
I don't mind telling you.

07:57.385 --> 07:58.618
The team.

07:59.588 --> 08:01.521
We were all great players.

08:04.492 --> 08:06.860
But they still talk about him.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.262
No one knows much.

08:10.131 --> 08:12.265
Just... I've heard stories.

08:13.602 --> 08:16.169
What did you hear
happened to him?

08:17.372 --> 08:19.272
What fate befell him?

08:20.642 --> 08:22.609
He was a goner. He died.

08:27.148 --> 08:28.363
How?

08:28.365 --> 08:29.581
He hit a school bus
full of little kids.

08:29.584 --> 08:32.552
Four or five little kids died
as I understand it.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.890
His car exploded. He was drunk.

08:38.626 --> 08:40.226
I'm sorry.

08:41.296 --> 08:42.996
For what?

08:42.998 --> 08:45.431
If he was your friend
or if I heard it wrong.

08:47.035 --> 08:50.303
I reckon you heard it
very right.

08:50.305 --> 08:53.573
The thing itself
and not the myth.

08:55.143 --> 08:57.343
He was no friend of mine.

08:58.446 --> 09:00.346
I call him Redskins.

09:01.316 --> 09:04.284
He was a certifiable alcoholic.

09:05.453 --> 09:08.621
Why do you think they gave
Crazy Horse that name?

09:14.629 --> 09:17.597
But booze in moderation
is balmy.

09:19.367 --> 09:23.369
You're carrying five subjects
this term

09:23.371 --> 09:26.973
and you're failing
three of them.

09:26.975 --> 09:28.508
I apply myself like heck, sir,

09:28.510 --> 09:32.278
but I just don't think
I'm all that book smart.

09:34.149 --> 09:36.482
It takes me an hour
to read a page.

09:36.484 --> 09:40.320
Sentences, they come to me
the wrong way around.

09:40.322 --> 09:42.221
I'm... I'm not kidding you.

09:42.490 --> 09:44.524
Fine.

09:44.526 --> 09:50.396
You'll take all your tests here
in the privacy of my office.

09:50.398 --> 09:53.132
And when this office
isn't available,

09:53.134 --> 09:57.103
then the study hall
in the academic building.

09:57.105 --> 10:01.441
You won't have any faculty
watching you.

10:01.443 --> 10:07.714
Bring whatever sheets you need
to test higher.

10:07.716 --> 10:10.516
As for essays,
I'll be giving you

10:10.518 --> 10:13.519
some of the best graded papers
from years past.

10:13.521 --> 10:17.423
You simply need to copy them
in your own handwriting.

10:17.425 --> 10:23.396
All I ask in return is that
you break Red Damon's record.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.113
Go Wildcats.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.681
Who's out there?

12:23.451 --> 12:26.853
Maybe you'd like
to hear about my rifle?

12:29.591 --> 12:32.892
It's a black Knight for
black crows, you understand?

12:34.762 --> 12:36.863
This here is the Savage 24

12:36.865 --> 12:40.600
and I pick off all kinds
of things at a hundred meters.

12:40.602 --> 12:42.668
Big games and varmints.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.174
I'm looking for a girl.

12:48.176 --> 12:49.542
Ain't we all?

12:49.544 --> 12:53.546
My friend's lost in...
My friend's lost out here

12:53.548 --> 12:55.681
and the mercury's sinking
near zero.

12:58.219 --> 13:01.687
Excuse me.

13:01.689 --> 13:05.491
I ain't too fond of conversing
with people I can't see.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.743
Well, neither am I.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.328
I'm not fond
of talking to strangers

13:09.330 --> 13:10.830
that had their rifle
pointed in my direction.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.700
I guess neither of us
are the best mixers.

13:14.702 --> 13:17.870
I don't know what girl will be
out in here in these woods.

13:17.872 --> 13:19.705
Liable to break a nail.

13:20.575 --> 13:22.708
She's a student
at the school.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.912
Probably be a big reward

13:25.914 --> 13:27.413
if anyone found her. No kidding.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.182
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.554
Hey, does anyone else
live out here?

13:34.556 --> 13:36.656
Why do you ask?

13:36.658 --> 13:38.925
I found a glove
belonging to the girl.

13:40.728 --> 13:42.644
Bloodied.

13:42.646 --> 13:44.563
So I'm anticipating
what the police

13:44.566 --> 13:46.766
are gonna ask
when I give them the glove.

13:49.304 --> 13:50.803
You know, you can get
turned around

13:50.805 --> 13:52.738
and freeze to death out here.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.507
Night like this.

13:56.344 --> 13:57.610
Up to now,
I've been a rotten host.

13:57.612 --> 13:59.612
Why don't you come on inside.

14:00.615 --> 14:02.748
The trouble is that rifle.

14:03.751 --> 14:05.585
Of course, you're right.

14:06.487 --> 14:09.104
I get the hint.
I'll put it down,

14:09.106 --> 14:11.724
and we can talk about this
like grown-ups.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.528
So come on out here, kid.

14:15.530 --> 14:17.897
Come on down here.
Come on inside.

14:29.644 --> 14:31.711
Does anyone else live out here?

14:33.381 --> 14:36.515
Yeah. Why don't you come on
in here. Come on inside.

14:37.619 --> 14:40.786
I said, does anyone else
live out in these woods?

14:40.788 --> 14:44.890
No, no. It's all bogus
boogeyman stories, you know?

14:44.892 --> 14:46.741
It's...

14:46.743 --> 14:48.593
No one can live out here,
it's too rough.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.465
I, myself, only come out here
once in a while

14:52.467 --> 14:53.532
to get away from my...

14:57.372 --> 14:59.805
So why aren't you at the game?

14:59.807 --> 15:03.042
Oh, it's one
missing cheer in that big ocean.

15:04.912 --> 15:06.778
I'm not much of a paper shaker.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.647
We can use all the cheers
we can get.

15:08.650 --> 15:12.485
Yeah, I'll probably go down
at the halfway point.

15:13.388 --> 15:16.789
Cut the gas. No, not gonna tell.

15:19.661 --> 15:22.361
You think I don't know
your name, right?

15:22.363 --> 15:23.829
It's not a very big school.

15:23.831 --> 15:27.333
Jean, right? Am I right?

15:27.335 --> 15:29.302
You're right.

15:30.438 --> 15:33.372
You're in the drama club.

15:33.374 --> 15:34.707
Head of the drama club,
actually.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.043
- Oh, really. Well, excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

15:38.046 --> 15:39.845
Are you gonna play Mary
in this shindig?

15:39.847 --> 15:42.782
No. I don't get involved
with the Nativity stuff.

15:42.784 --> 15:45.017
I'm working on something else
actually.

15:45.019 --> 15:46.819
Oh, what's that?

15:46.821 --> 15:49.355
It's an original play
I'm writing.

15:49.357 --> 15:51.590
I'd rather not get into it.

15:53.461 --> 15:55.061
Okay, well suit yourself.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.800
Are you going home
for Christmas?

16:01.869 --> 16:03.602
Sure.

16:03.604 --> 16:05.571
You have a boyfriend back home?

16:06.941 --> 16:08.723
Not sure that concerns you.

16:08.725 --> 16:10.508
Well, you don't have
a boyfriend here.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.945
- I don't?
- No. I keep my eye out.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.984
You ever, um, think about
taking off your binoculars?

16:21.856 --> 16:24.890
- <i>Not aiming forVogue magazine.</i>
- What?

16:25.593 --> 16:27.126
I'm gonna go back to the game.

16:27.128 --> 16:28.627
Hey!

16:28.629 --> 16:30.829
Don't cut out on me.

16:30.831 --> 16:33.032
Well, don't pull on me
like a goddamn ragdoll.

16:33.034 --> 16:36.102
It's all the tussle with
the guys, I guess. I'm sorry.

16:36.104 --> 16:37.770
Hey, look. Don't you think

16:37.772 --> 16:39.872
I'm some kind of flutter bum
or something?

16:39.874 --> 16:42.141
- You're not my type.
- Oh, come on.

16:42.143 --> 16:45.444
You're oversexed I know it.
You'd do me on the toilet seat.

16:45.446 --> 16:46.946
I don't want any trouble.

17:16.544 --> 17:17.943
You awake?

17:22.550 --> 17:24.683
Cold out here, kid. Please.

17:25.619 --> 17:27.051
Did you see her?

17:28.956 --> 17:32.825
I placed you the moment
you threw the rock at my head.

17:34.128 --> 17:38.030
You're that quarterback who got
exiled for smoking reefer.

17:39.967 --> 17:41.934
Cobey Delmore.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.202
You were a natural.

17:43.204 --> 17:46.105
You were a natural
Sonny Jurgensen.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.540
Thanks.

17:48.542 --> 17:50.976
The good news about you
losing that field general post

17:50.978 --> 17:54.480
is you know
who your friends are now.

17:54.482 --> 17:57.983
But bad news would be,
you ain't got any.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.654
You're on your own, kid.

18:01.656 --> 18:04.089
Every man for himself.

18:04.725 --> 18:06.225
I got a couple of pals.

18:06.227 --> 18:08.661
You think you got
a couple of pals.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.530
You think you got
a couple of pals.

18:11.532 --> 18:15.768
Everybody we meet
is ultimately unknowable.

18:16.537 --> 18:18.204
Never who we think they are.

18:18.206 --> 18:19.939
If you get drafted...

18:19.941 --> 18:22.908
get your nose shot off
in Ho Chi Minh.

18:25.847 --> 18:29.215
The number of people
can turn into zero.

18:31.052 --> 18:32.952
I kind of like you comatose.

18:33.588 --> 18:35.488
By the way, this, uh...

18:36.891 --> 18:40.025
loop of lash rope
is meant for cattle.

18:40.027 --> 18:41.727
Did you see her?

18:44.699 --> 18:46.999
Check the morgue, big shot.

18:48.803 --> 18:50.503
Why would I do that?

18:55.276 --> 18:57.710
'Cause she's dead.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.762
I saw...

19:00.764 --> 19:03.014
I saw her... I saw her today.
I saw her body.

19:06.753 --> 19:08.720
If what you say is true,
then where is the body?

19:08.723 --> 19:10.523
Huh? I found her glove.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.725
The man in the woods...

19:13.928 --> 19:15.127
is real.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.797
I saw him... I saw him once.

19:20.668 --> 19:23.869
He's doing strange things
out here.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.172
Only he ain't a man.
He ain't a man or a woman.

19:28.609 --> 19:30.709
He's doing things that
don't make any sense.

19:30.711 --> 19:35.114
Like making an aisle of orchids,
carrying a sack.

19:35.750 --> 19:39.919
Fingernails, sharp, long.

19:40.755 --> 19:44.089
White-haired, down on the knees.

19:45.293 --> 19:47.826
No nose to speak off,
hardly a mouth,

19:47.828 --> 19:50.930
no lips on the mouth,
there's only eyes.

19:50.932 --> 19:54.199
I was never so sick in my life.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.870
Where does it live?
This witch?

19:58.573 --> 20:01.574
Everywhere, nowhere. Everywhere.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.943
Tents made of animal skin.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.346
You won't find your girl.

20:08.683 --> 20:11.250
Or her remains, I'm sorry, kid.

20:40.881 --> 20:43.616
This rifle will be trained
on you as I walk away.

20:44.752 --> 20:48.120
So count to 100. Slowly.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.988
What about my head?

20:49.990 --> 20:51.857
You can tell Rudy the janitor
at your school.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.959
Tell Rudy I'm out here,
I need a physician.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.628
And then go back
inside your trailer.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.162
Start counting.

20:57.164 --> 20:58.631
One Mississippi.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.033
Two Mississippi.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.269
Three Mississippi.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.139
Four Mississippi.

21:08.209 --> 21:10.109
Five Mississippi.

21:11.112 --> 21:12.978
Six Mississippi.

21:14.081 --> 21:16.015
Seven Mississippi.

21:17.752 --> 21:19.418
Eight Mississippi.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.355
Nine Mississippi.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.659
Ten Mississippi...

21:33.901 --> 21:35.868
Just give her a second.

21:35.870 --> 21:36.969
I'm freezing, by the way.

21:36.971 --> 21:39.104
Oh, thanks for the newscast.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.842
Since we're off-campus,

21:43.844 --> 21:45.344
should we call Ms. Roethke
by her first name?

21:45.346 --> 21:46.779
What is her first name?

21:46.781 --> 21:48.313
It's Louise, and no.

21:48.315 --> 21:49.848
But we're off-campus,
aren't we all peers?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.383
No, we're not.

21:51.385 --> 21:52.951
Louise.

21:52.953 --> 21:55.254
You know way too much about her.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.707
I know all about her, too.

21:58.709 --> 22:00.726
I heard she studied in Paris
at the Sorbonne.

22:00.728 --> 22:02.027
That's not how you say it.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.129
That's exactly how I say it.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.835
Ladies.

22:09.837 --> 22:12.471
It's after midnight.
Is everything okay?

22:12.473 --> 22:14.206
No, obviously.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.974
Shut up, Lenore.

22:15.976 --> 22:17.976
Well, come in.
But take your shoes off first.

22:17.978 --> 22:20.178
Leave them at the doorway.

22:20.180 --> 22:22.381
You mean, like,
the Orientals do, right, Louise?

22:23.417 --> 22:25.984
Sure, Suzie.

22:27.788 --> 22:30.222
This is Jean's dream.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.124
Wow. Laurette Taylor.

22:32.126 --> 22:34.159
She has a bunch of books
about her.

22:35.262 --> 22:36.495
You checked the chapel?

22:36.497 --> 22:38.030
We checked everywhere.

22:42.136 --> 22:45.003
Was there anything strange
about how she left her room?

22:45.005 --> 22:46.939
She left this on the floor.

22:46.941 --> 22:49.742
It's not entirely uncommon
for Jean.

22:49.744 --> 22:53.812
She can be a real slob. I mean,
so can I, to be frank, Louise.

22:53.814 --> 22:56.348
But, that's why we
get along so well.

22:56.350 --> 22:58.751
She thinks I'm her favorite
actress in the school.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.585
She's writing a part for me.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.420
Uh, excuse me, isn't this tome
<i>Tropic of Cancer</i>

23:02.423 --> 23:03.789
considered obscene?

23:03.791 --> 23:04.923
Not in Europe.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.025
Well, we're not in Europe.

23:07.027 --> 23:08.861
That's up to each of us
to decide.

23:08.863 --> 23:11.079
What does that mean?

23:11.081 --> 23:13.298
All things are nothing
but phenomena in the mind.

23:14.235 --> 23:17.002
It's a fact.
We're not in Europe.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.837
There are national borders.

23:18.839 --> 23:20.773
This sexy stuff
does not go over here.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.241
What about Alphus the Palpus?

23:22.243 --> 23:24.343
I'm talking about Literature,
Suzie. Grow up.

23:24.345 --> 23:27.012
I don't wanna grow up,
you valedictorian.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.448
I read a few pages
of D.H. Lawrence once

23:29.450 --> 23:31.316
and almost tossed my cookies.

23:31.318 --> 23:33.185
Did the end of the
<i>Chatterley ban not reach your...</i>

23:33.187 --> 23:36.155
Could I borrow one of your
Parisian sweaters, Louise?

23:36.157 --> 23:38.791
Can we please talk about Jean?

23:38.793 --> 23:40.559
There's a draft.
I'm not making it up.

23:40.561 --> 23:42.461
I certainly see
your dilemma.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.095
If Jean gets in trouble,

23:44.097 --> 23:45.729
her collegiate future
could be in jeopardy.

23:45.731 --> 23:47.364
You don't wanna make
a big stink over nothing.

23:47.368 --> 23:49.217
But if she is in danger,

23:49.219 --> 23:51.069
biting your tongue
could be biting hers.

23:51.071 --> 23:53.087
I've gone through many stories
in my mind.

23:53.089 --> 23:55.106
Maybe she just got on a train,
prettied up her face

23:55.109 --> 23:57.242
and went to the city for fun.

23:57.244 --> 23:59.077
I know Jean.

23:59.079 --> 24:01.012
You all know her better.

24:01.014 --> 24:02.948
Do you really think
she is traveling incognito

24:02.950 --> 24:05.083
through the night,
made up like a madam?

24:05.085 --> 24:06.985
Especially
if she's surreptitiously

24:06.987 --> 24:08.954
with Hobey Delmore, as you say.

24:08.956 --> 24:11.005
Why would she go to the city?

24:11.007 --> 24:13.057
He is here
so the party is here for her.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.360
She went to see
<i>Toys in the Attic once</i>

24:15.362 --> 24:17.095
but she left a note.

24:17.531 --> 24:20.298
How did she like the play?

24:20.300 --> 24:23.068
She says Maureen Stapleton
and Jason Robards were swell.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.437
I think she would've left
one of us a note.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.973
Or got in a phone booth.

24:27.975 --> 24:30.509
Even when Jean's lost.
She's not absent-minded.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.044
I'm not psychic,

24:32.046 --> 24:33.795
nor do I consider myself

24:33.797 --> 24:35.547
like some other's here,
kind of a girl gumshoe.

24:35.549 --> 24:38.851
But if I had to say something,
which apparently I do,

24:38.853 --> 24:40.853
I suspect something's not right.

24:54.368 --> 24:55.868
All right, then.

25:00.140 --> 25:02.174
Who is she calling?

25:22.062 --> 25:25.297
Vivien?
Yes, hello. It's Louise.

25:25.299 --> 25:28.467
- Who the hell is Vivien?
- Shh.

25:28.469 --> 25:30.035
I'm sorry to be calling so late,

25:30.037 --> 25:32.437
but there is a student
who is lost,

25:32.439 --> 25:35.307
and I believe
you might be able to help.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.794
Yes, Vivien, that's right.

25:39.796 --> 25:41.679
Vivien Waldorf?
The Headmaster's wife?

25:41.682 --> 25:43.798
No way, silly.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.917
We could meet you at the Manor
in ten minutes, yes.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.586
Rocky.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.254
You were right,
you little squirrel.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.923
- I know.
- It is the headmaster's wife.

25:51.692 --> 25:53.992
Is your husband there?

25:53.994 --> 25:56.295
Because it's important that this
is between us. For now at least.

25:57.531 --> 26:00.165
But you don't know
when he will be getting back?

26:01.068 --> 26:03.335
It varies? I see...

26:05.205 --> 26:06.338
Yes.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.675
Would you?

26:09.677 --> 26:11.510
That would be ideal.

26:13.047 --> 26:14.713
Thank you so much, Vivien.

26:18.552 --> 26:22.654
Was that Headmaster
Waldorf's wife by any chance?

26:24.591 --> 26:26.325
She's a friend of mine.

26:30.497 --> 26:32.998
She's gonna quietly get her
Royce Rolls out of the garage

26:33.000 --> 26:35.500
and pick us up
outside the library.

26:35.502 --> 26:37.602
Hasten on, ye shepherds.
Put your shoesies on.

26:37.604 --> 26:40.339
We're to wait behind
the paper birch trees.

26:41.108 --> 26:43.575
Isn't Mrs. Waldorf insane?

26:44.244 --> 26:45.978
That's an incredibly dull

26:45.980 --> 26:48.246
and dismissive way
of seeing someone.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.117
This all seems very bizarre,
all of a sudden.

26:52.119 --> 26:53.684
I'm uncomfortable.

26:53.686 --> 26:55.252
You have these salacious
literature all over the place

26:55.255 --> 26:57.389
and we're going
to a lunatic lady...

26:57.391 --> 26:58.623
Lenore!

26:59.526 --> 27:01.259
Welcome to the world.

27:03.263 --> 27:04.463
Come on.

27:27.421 --> 27:31.723
I don't like the way this mirror
makes me look.

27:31.725 --> 27:35.761
Didn't we agree to banish
this mirror forever?

27:35.763 --> 27:37.662
Mirror, mirror.

27:41.168 --> 27:44.336
Where on earth
are you going, Petunia?

27:44.338 --> 27:46.505
Just out for some air.

27:46.507 --> 27:48.140
I couldn't sleep.

27:48.142 --> 27:50.475
Some air?
There's no air out there.

27:51.178 --> 27:53.411
Just a wad of sleet.

27:53.413 --> 27:55.647
Well, I'm not going very far.
I only wanted Chesterfield.

27:55.649 --> 27:57.049
What did you say?

27:57.051 --> 27:59.251
I said I'm not going very far.

28:00.320 --> 28:04.289
Why don't we put on some Wagner

28:04.291 --> 28:07.592
and turn this room
into a dance floor.

28:10.330 --> 28:13.532
Are you of the mood to dance?

28:13.534 --> 28:16.101
Your eyebrows
are freshly painted.

28:16.103 --> 28:20.305
It's lovely. Always so fetching.

28:20.307 --> 28:23.742
I can't dance to Wagner
and you're drunk.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.445
You're like a bull
in a China shop. Stop. Please.

28:26.447 --> 28:29.481
Fine, then we won't dance.
Sorry.

28:36.790 --> 28:41.827
I don't mean to be irksome
but have you taken your pills?

28:41.829 --> 28:44.096
- Dr. Fancher says...
- Yes.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.764
...if you don't take them
every day...

28:45.766 --> 28:47.566
Oh, the good old Dr. Fancher.

28:47.568 --> 28:50.135
"The bringer of dawn."
I took them.

28:50.137 --> 28:51.792
Please, now.

28:51.794 --> 28:53.449
Will you get out of my way,
Ralph?

28:53.451 --> 28:55.107
I like it
when you call me "Ralph."

28:56.677 --> 28:59.811
Your letters way back when...

29:00.514 --> 29:02.380
Your telegrams.

29:03.117 --> 29:07.319
Ralph this, Ralph that.

29:08.755 --> 29:14.459
Maybe you can tell me
how to be special to you.

29:14.461 --> 29:19.798
Lord knows I will follow
your instructions to a tee.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.535
It doesn't figure does it?

29:24.872 --> 29:30.242
I can feel that more than half
the cells of my body are dead.

29:30.244 --> 29:32.844
But still I'm looking
for that kiss.

31:12.312 --> 31:14.546
Heavy on the Vics, E.W. Noyes.

31:14.548 --> 31:16.781
When was the last time
you saw Hobey?

31:16.783 --> 31:19.517
Today. At the game.

31:19.519 --> 31:22.254
I had the flu and he was...

31:22.256 --> 31:23.588
We were studying.

31:23.590 --> 31:24.923
You don't have
to keep covering for him.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.891
We're trying to find these two.

31:26.893 --> 31:28.876
No, really, we were studying.

31:28.878 --> 31:30.862
About all the animals that
hibernate. It's not just bears.

31:30.864 --> 31:32.830
Box turtles
go right into their shell.

31:32.832 --> 31:34.799
They slow their heart rate down
to one beat per ten minutes

31:34.801 --> 31:36.350
and they stop breathing.

31:36.352 --> 31:37.902
They take oxygen
into their skin.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.739
Snails hibernate too.

31:40.741 --> 31:44.042
And fireflies, but underground,
they burrow.

31:44.044 --> 31:47.312
But we were only studying
because Jean never showed.

31:47.314 --> 31:49.347
Well, Hobey ran into the woods
to look for Jean

31:49.349 --> 31:51.983
so your inclination was right
about that, E.W.

31:53.287 --> 31:54.719
You know my name?

31:54.721 --> 31:58.590
- Excuse me?
- Nothing. No, um...

31:58.592 --> 32:00.659
Yes, my inclination was that
he was in the woods.

32:00.661 --> 32:02.761
Yes, that was my inclination.

32:02.763 --> 32:07.065
How many times are we gonna
say "inclination"? Jeez.

32:07.067 --> 32:09.734
Mrs. Waldorf,
may I ask where are we going?

32:09.736 --> 32:12.304
Oh, you're a polite young man,
aren't you?

32:12.306 --> 32:15.039
Yes, of course you may ask.

32:15.041 --> 32:17.775
We are going to a cocktail
lounge called The Mercy.

32:17.778 --> 32:20.345
That's very funny,
Mrs. Waldorf, but, uh,

32:20.347 --> 32:22.113
really, where are we going?

32:22.115 --> 32:23.882
Now, I've learned
very quickly, with Mrs. Waldorf,

32:23.884 --> 32:27.419
when you think she's kidding,
you realize she's not.

32:27.421 --> 32:28.953
I can hear you, you know.

32:28.955 --> 32:30.655
Oh, I know.

32:31.658 --> 32:35.493
But we are not of age,
Mrs. Waldorf.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.729
Well, you will stay outside

32:37.731 --> 32:40.699
while Ms. Roethke and I
go inside.

32:40.701 --> 32:42.956
Don't worry.

32:42.958 --> 32:45.213
We'll figure out something
to tell your dorm heads.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.471
Who's at this
cocktail lounge of yours?

32:47.474 --> 32:48.873
A policeman friend.

32:48.875 --> 32:50.542
What's his name?

32:50.544 --> 32:52.009
Buster Heath.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.477
The black one
in the papers?

32:53.480 --> 32:55.847
Oh, boy!
This lady. I swear.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.583
Lenore, that's probably enough
out of you.

32:58.585 --> 33:02.020
It's okay. I like Lenore's sass.

33:03.824 --> 33:06.091
Sorry,
what's your name again?

33:06.093 --> 33:07.659
Her name is Paula.

33:07.661 --> 33:09.728
Oh, thank you, boy.

33:09.730 --> 33:12.364
To answer
your question, Paula...

33:12.366 --> 33:15.934
Yes, the black one
in the papers.

33:15.936 --> 33:19.003
Things aren't exactly looking up
for him, are they?

33:20.574 --> 33:22.140
There's a veil of shit.

33:22.943 --> 33:24.642
A laundry pile of crap

33:24.644 --> 33:27.045
that we must all waft through
for ourselves.

33:27.047 --> 33:31.049
And she cusses too,
ladies and gents.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.802
Well, I thought of you

33:34.804 --> 33:36.554
because you're the only
honest policeman I know.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.123
And you have that Labrador,
Shirley...

33:38.125 --> 33:39.523
Shirley Temple, yeah.

33:39.525 --> 33:40.924
But there ain't a goddamn thing,
pardon my French,

33:40.927 --> 33:42.660
that Shirley and I can do.

33:42.662 --> 33:45.063
We're mothballed.
I'm a permanently off-duty cop.

33:47.167 --> 33:50.835
How do you know about
Shirley Temple at your age?

33:50.837 --> 33:52.737
My mom made me learn
the dance routine

33:52.739 --> 33:56.007
from <i> Captain January</i>
"At the Codfish Ball."

33:56.009 --> 33:59.744
My mom would be Shirley Temple,
I'd be Buddy Ebsen.

33:59.746 --> 34:04.149
Shirley Temple was always too
much of a totsy for my taste.

34:04.151 --> 34:05.717
It's a joke.

34:05.719 --> 34:10.688
I have a big Labrador I named
her Shirley Temple. It's a gag.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.643
Tough crowd.

34:15.645 --> 34:17.862
We believe
the student is lost in the woods

34:17.864 --> 34:21.166
and her boyfriend
is looking for her too.

34:21.168 --> 34:23.967
Listen. I have been
framed by the entire force,

34:23.969 --> 34:25.837
and I doubt that I can
disprove it in court.

34:25.839 --> 34:28.806
You see, now I tend
to take things lying down.

34:28.809 --> 34:30.942
You can say that I'm exhibiting
my lamb nature.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.960
Tell me does it suit me?

34:32.962 --> 34:34.978
No. Self-pity
is rarely flattering.

34:34.981 --> 34:36.514
You should've seen me
in my prime.

34:36.516 --> 34:38.116
I don't believe in buttering up.

34:38.918 --> 34:40.851
Well, then you must be
into pain.

34:40.853 --> 34:41.985
Who's into pain?

34:41.987 --> 34:43.455
Our friend here.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.056
She likes it raw.

34:45.058 --> 34:46.858
I was into pain once.

34:47.761 --> 34:49.893
Then I developed a stutter.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.533
You ever go to that bar Rusty's?

34:55.534 --> 34:57.117
What do you know about Rusty's?

34:57.119 --> 34:58.702
Well, one time
we almost raided it.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.505
Then Rusty paid off
the police chief,

35:00.507 --> 35:02.189
I scouted it some.

35:02.191 --> 35:03.874
The normal entrance to the bar
is on Walnut,

35:03.877 --> 35:05.844
but you go around
near the Clint Street side,

35:05.846 --> 35:07.479
through the side door,
up the steps...

35:07.481 --> 35:08.613
And you're at my lucky spot.

35:08.615 --> 35:10.748
Well, is it ever not lucky?

35:10.750 --> 35:12.884
You bet. And when it's not
lucky, it's lonesome.

35:12.886 --> 35:14.719
I had a cousin.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.555
Chops all her hair off
so she looks like a man.

35:17.557 --> 35:19.023
She doesn't own
a single black bra

35:19.025 --> 35:22.494
or have a powder,
or use a rabbit's foot.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.862
She goes around natural,
as she calls it,

35:23.864 --> 35:25.546
in Levi's and a rough blouse.

35:25.548 --> 35:27.231
I tried to tell her
curiosity killed the cat.

35:27.234 --> 35:28.844
Satisfaction brought it back.

35:28.846 --> 35:30.456
Safe and sound
from head to ground,

35:30.458 --> 35:32.069
from head to ground
it was safe and sound.

35:32.639 --> 35:34.639
The missing girl, Jean,

35:34.641 --> 35:37.509
she's very discerning
like yourself.

35:37.511 --> 35:40.245
I'm sure she's just gangbusters.

35:40.247 --> 35:42.514
You know they call this place
the Mercy Lounge,

35:42.516 --> 35:43.848
but like most things
in this life,

35:43.850 --> 35:45.884
it is a grave mis-advertisement.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.921
Go back to your imported bubbly,
Mrs. Waldorf.

35:49.923 --> 35:53.591
Otherwise, people may see you
here and spin grimy lies.

35:53.593 --> 35:55.225
I thank you for getting me
out of jail,

35:55.227 --> 35:56.860
but forgive me
if I don't wanna spend

35:56.863 --> 35:58.796
my last few days as a free man

35:58.798 --> 36:00.698
looking for a lost girl
in the cold.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.033
You disappoint me, Mr. Heath.

36:02.035 --> 36:03.568
Well, I disappoint
a lot of people.

36:03.570 --> 36:05.069
I'm a fly-in-the-ointment type.

36:05.071 --> 36:06.570
The guys in the force
are disappointed

36:06.572 --> 36:08.072
that I haven't crashed my truck
into a colder wall.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.610
"There are 8 million stories
in the naked city

36:12.612 --> 36:14.212
and this has been one of them."

36:15.248 --> 36:18.917
You wanna claim that the world
is a mis-advertisement.

36:18.919 --> 36:22.220
That TV dinners are filled
with gravy instead of meat.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.690
That Listerine can't really
reduce the likelihood

36:25.692 --> 36:27.958
of catching a cold.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.227
That Lucky Strikes
don't soothe the throat.

36:31.197 --> 36:32.697
They egg us on.

36:32.699 --> 36:35.099
The old bait and switch, I know.

36:35.101 --> 36:38.736
But there is a girl out there
in the woods right now.

36:38.738 --> 36:41.072
She may be dead,
she may be alive...

36:41.741 --> 36:43.241
but she's real.

36:43.243 --> 36:44.909
She's real.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.579
And that is why
I paid your bail.

36:47.581 --> 36:50.581
Because you were real.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.584
In a world where most people
and most things are snowing us.

36:55.655 --> 36:58.122
You overestimate me, madam.

36:58.124 --> 37:00.992
I'm no Indian tracker.
My hair is short.

37:01.661 --> 37:04.195
I do not overestimate you.

37:14.641 --> 37:16.107
Foxy chicks in there?

37:16.109 --> 37:18.009
Suzie, you dipstick.

37:18.011 --> 37:20.078
What? Sue and Joan?
They ain't too bad.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.948
Neither are you, Mac,
you don't look like a cop.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.150
You ladies have anything
that belongs to Jean?

37:26.152 --> 37:28.052
Yes. Yes. Yes.

37:28.054 --> 37:29.287
This is her scarf.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.091
It looks agreeable on you...

37:33.093 --> 37:34.993
Uh, the scarf.

37:37.163 --> 37:40.298
The perfume on this scarf
hers or yours?

37:40.300 --> 37:41.633
Uh, it's Jean's.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.834
Boutique Chantelle Paris.

37:43.836 --> 37:46.036
She bought it...
She bought it from Macy's.

37:46.039 --> 37:47.238
She always wears this much?

37:47.240 --> 37:49.306
She definitely overdoes it.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.375
Then I guess we're looking for
the smell of Paris in the woods.

37:53.847 --> 37:55.713
You don't have to give me
a courtesy laugh.

37:55.715 --> 37:57.115
I know it wasn't funny.

37:57.651 --> 37:59.394
You're right.

37:59.396 --> 38:01.139
Sidney Poitier
is not funny either,

38:01.141 --> 38:02.885
so I wouldn't worry about it.

38:03.289 --> 38:04.989
I'll try not to.

38:06.693 --> 38:08.760
He made eyes at me.

38:08.762 --> 38:10.728
Dreamy eyes.

38:10.730 --> 38:12.697
Dream on. He was afraid
because you were drooling.

38:12.699 --> 38:14.264
That's a gas.

38:14.266 --> 38:15.832
So where are we booking to
now, Viv?

38:15.835 --> 38:19.070
We go back to campus
where Ms. Roethke and I

38:19.072 --> 38:21.072
explain to your dorm heads
that you were out late

38:21.074 --> 38:23.741
interviewing me
for the newspaper.

38:23.743 --> 38:25.376
What about Jean and Hobey?

38:25.378 --> 38:27.377
They're gonna ask.

38:27.379 --> 38:29.379
I'll tell them that Jean
is still working at the paper.

38:29.382 --> 38:32.216
That she could be there all
night because of the deadline.

38:32.218 --> 38:36.688
And I'll tell my dorm head
that Hobey had a wedding.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.272
He forgot to sign out.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.857
His older brother's
the bridegroom, I'll say.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.225
It will go over.
Hobey has a big family.

38:41.227 --> 38:43.227
He's always packing up
his Gladstones.

38:45.065 --> 38:47.231
It may seem inappropriate to ask

38:47.233 --> 38:49.333
at a time like this,
Mrs. Waldorf.

38:49.335 --> 38:51.836
But since I have you here...

38:51.838 --> 38:54.906
you were in Red Damon's class
weren't you?

38:54.908 --> 38:57.108
Yes. Tragic.

38:57.110 --> 39:01.713
Um, Gabe Lehane is on pace
to beat Red's record.

39:01.715 --> 39:05.432
I'm writing a piece about Red,

39:05.434 --> 39:09.152
but, unfortunately,
there's barely any scoop handy.

39:09.155 --> 39:10.922
Did you know him?

39:10.924 --> 39:13.458
We conversed
on a couple of occasions.

39:14.994 --> 39:17.995
It was always jam packed
around him

39:17.997 --> 39:21.132
and he was very soft-spoken.

39:21.134 --> 39:24.001
Well, one didn't go to school
with Red Damon

39:24.003 --> 39:25.737
so much as witness him.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.571
There was plenty of hoopla.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.406
Right. And that's
the queer thing, ma'am,

39:29.409 --> 39:32.744
is that the hoopla has somehow
been expunged.

39:33.446 --> 39:35.279
Yes, of course.

39:35.281 --> 39:37.482
What happened with him
and how he died.

39:37.484 --> 39:40.351
Can... can you maybe
tell me something about Red

39:40.353 --> 39:43.020
that could add to the piece?

39:44.157 --> 39:46.657
He worked for the school

39:46.659 --> 39:49.160
in order to help his family
pay for the mortgage.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.362
I remember that.

39:52.198 --> 39:54.398
The dichotomy of him
being a champion

39:54.400 --> 39:57.869
and then seeing him on weekends
in an apron

39:57.871 --> 40:00.171
with a push mop on the floor.

40:01.174 --> 40:04.075
That's all I recall
about Red Damon.

40:04.077 --> 40:06.477
And then the undertaker
took him.

40:42.348 --> 40:43.514
All right.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.485
I don't like the smell but...

40:47.487 --> 40:50.321
you women have your own ideas
about things.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.193
Hey, Shirley.
Slack off, will you?

40:57.831 --> 40:59.230
Shirley!

41:06.506 --> 41:08.372
You shouldn't look at that
too long, you know?

41:08.374 --> 41:11.108
They get you dreaming that
you can take on

41:11.110 --> 41:14.345
this whole grim landscape
by yourself.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.380
Ain't that exactly
what you're doing out here

41:16.382 --> 41:17.849
all solo in the woods?

41:18.618 --> 41:20.251
Opposite.

41:21.321 --> 41:23.988
Hiding out from my wife.
She terrifies me.

41:23.990 --> 41:27.458
And my brain feels like
a baked potato in here.

41:27.460 --> 41:30.261
I need a candy stripper
or some scotch, or something.

41:30.263 --> 41:32.163
Heater's broke, you noticed?

41:32.165 --> 41:34.999
All right. Look, I...

41:35.001 --> 41:37.401
I don't want to put you through
the ringer so spill it.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.272
I told you all I know.

41:41.274 --> 41:44.075
This rural hooligan comes up
behind me...

41:44.544 --> 41:46.878
Boom! I was out cold.

41:47.447 --> 41:48.613
I never saw him.

41:48.615 --> 41:51.315
Sir, I'm a cop.

41:52.118 --> 41:54.352
You mentioned that.

41:54.354 --> 41:56.621
But you're colored, and you
haven't produced a badge,

41:56.623 --> 42:01.259
and I find those two facts
to be a touch dubious.

42:01.261 --> 42:05.263
Your pup is gnawing
at my gabardines, do you mind?

42:05.265 --> 42:11.302
Look, two kids from
the prep school went absent.

42:11.304 --> 42:14.572
This will be the first
of many inquiries

42:14.574 --> 42:16.674
should the situation turn sour.

42:16.676 --> 42:19.076
But right now
it's only kind of dire.

42:19.078 --> 42:23.114
And you talk to me,
it's just casual talk.

42:23.116 --> 42:25.416
More formal terms like,
tampering,

42:25.418 --> 42:27.385
like withholding evidence
they don't come up

42:27.387 --> 42:30.054
in casual conversations
such as this.

42:30.056 --> 42:32.990
They don't come up
because you... you ain't a cop.

42:32.992 --> 42:34.458
Cops are like...

42:34.460 --> 42:37.461
You know, they act, like,
all crazy.

42:37.463 --> 42:39.396
They make big gestures,

42:39.398 --> 42:41.332
and they're spitting tobacco
all over the place,

42:41.334 --> 42:43.334
you know, everywhere,
except the spittoon.

42:43.336 --> 42:46.470
You know my brother,
my brother-in-law is a cop,

42:46.472 --> 42:49.040
and he's an asshole.

42:49.042 --> 42:52.944
You don't point that gun
with much conviction.

42:52.946 --> 42:55.079
Have you ever shot a guy?

42:55.081 --> 42:58.015
Yeah, that's the problem.

42:58.017 --> 43:00.952
Each time it chips away
at my servitude.

43:00.954 --> 43:03.220
Lot of death.

43:03.222 --> 43:06.557
Lot of death lately.
I... I can't even...

43:06.559 --> 43:09.627
I can't even bring myself
to open the paper.

43:11.097 --> 43:14.632
Hardest... hardest one
to hit me was, uh...

43:15.635 --> 43:18.436
Patsy. The Patsy death.

43:18.438 --> 43:21.372
Oh, yeah. My girlfriend liked
her too. She had that song...

43:21.374 --> 43:25.743
No, I'm... I'm talking about
the "Patsy" Lee Harvey Oswald.

43:28.114 --> 43:33.517
Real easy to criticize a man

43:34.153 --> 43:36.487
when he's out of favor.

43:36.489 --> 43:40.257
Make him shoulder the blame
for everyone else.

43:41.427 --> 43:42.727
You got me.

43:43.696 --> 43:45.663
I'm not a cop.

43:45.665 --> 43:47.631
I got kicked off the force
a couple of days ago,

43:47.633 --> 43:50.317
as a matter of fact.

43:50.319 --> 43:53.004
Me and them boys, I guess you
could say, we're incompatible.

43:55.742 --> 43:58.342
They will be coming for you.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.778
Those cops
like your brother-in-law.

44:00.780 --> 44:06.050
Oh, you'll be in such demand.

44:06.052 --> 44:08.819
Them come slopped and mean,

44:08.821 --> 44:11.589
with club sandwiches hanging
out of their faces and...

44:11.591 --> 44:14.025
they'll make sure
that your head hurts a lot worse

44:14.027 --> 44:16.060
than it does right now.

44:16.062 --> 44:19.312
They're lazy, aren't they?

44:19.314 --> 44:22.565
I mean, they'd rather...
they'd rather railroad a tramp

44:22.568 --> 44:24.168
than solve a homicide.

44:24.170 --> 44:26.303
My wife,
she's always talking about,

44:26.305 --> 44:30.441
like, what a great man
her brother is.

44:30.810 --> 44:32.443
Great.

44:35.747 --> 44:38.181
You know, this guy,
you should see what he does.

44:38.184 --> 44:40.584
He beats people. He beats them.

44:41.554 --> 44:45.122
He... He's like...
He's, uh... He's just...

44:45.124 --> 44:49.160
- Just horrible.
- Look, which way did the boy go?

44:49.162 --> 44:51.429
You're that...
You're the fall guy.

44:51.431 --> 44:54.565
You're the Heath fella
who's been in the paper.

44:54.567 --> 44:59.170
They... they set you up, man.
They set you up good.

44:59.172 --> 45:01.505
Oh, they bathed you...

45:01.507 --> 45:04.575
They bathed you
in their bullshit.

45:05.278 --> 45:08.412
Made you the perfect pawn.

45:08.648 --> 45:10.514
How about that?

45:13.219 --> 45:16.854
The quarterback,
he took my rifle.

45:16.856 --> 45:20.391
He went that way.
He went like...

45:20.393 --> 45:24.662
The direction he was going in
was like clear for the pond.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.699
He's got my rifle.

45:28.701 --> 45:31.502
He's got my rifle,
he's got my Jim Bowie knife...

45:31.804 --> 45:33.370
Uh...

45:35.508 --> 45:36.774
Yeah.

45:38.111 --> 45:40.144
He went that way.

45:40.146 --> 45:43.214
He went that way.

45:43.216 --> 45:45.749
There is a witch
in these woods.

45:45.751 --> 45:48.185
Why hasn't she bewitched you?

45:48.187 --> 45:49.887
'Cause it ain't a she.
It's an "it."

45:49.889 --> 45:51.288
It's an apparition.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.124
Beyond one's sex or another.

45:53.126 --> 45:55.493
I don't ask any questions,
I just...

45:55.495 --> 45:57.561
Knock wood, eat sliced ham,

45:57.563 --> 46:00.464
when I'm feeling lucky,
I go out walking after midnight

46:00.466 --> 46:02.700
but not too late.
You understand?

46:03.503 --> 46:05.603
I'm definitely
not feeling lucky.

46:05.605 --> 46:08.172
But when you're destined
for jail,

46:08.174 --> 46:10.141
why wait for someone
to butter your toast.

46:11.210 --> 46:12.543
See you.

49:13.492 --> 49:16.894
<i>The lightest, politest,

49:21.734 --> 49:24.001
Did you ever
wanna fit in more...

49:24.904 --> 49:26.870
with us, middle-of-the-roaders?

49:26.872 --> 49:29.707
I sure did. Once.

49:29.709 --> 49:32.343
But it became too exhausting.

49:33.879 --> 49:36.780
Your students
really respond to you.

49:37.950 --> 49:42.486
They see you as a scholarly
mutineer or some such.

49:42.488 --> 49:44.822
But it's easy pickings.

49:44.824 --> 49:47.524
Teenagers loved
to be shanghaied.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.626
They study Math, History,

49:49.628 --> 49:51.628
then they come
into your classroom,

49:51.630 --> 49:54.031
and you tell them,
it's all gobbledygook.

49:55.835 --> 49:58.902
Bang. Instant hero.

49:58.904 --> 50:01.438
Preaching misanthropy
to adolescents

50:01.440 --> 50:04.608
is like shooting fish
in a barrel.

50:04.610 --> 50:08.011
But maybe
what some literature is for

50:08.013 --> 50:12.816
is to say one and one
doesn't equal two.

50:12.818 --> 50:14.985
Poetry can dissolve
the narrative

50:14.987 --> 50:17.654
that says I am here
and you are over there.

50:17.656 --> 50:22.393
It allows us to see ourselves
like fingers, like...

50:22.395 --> 50:23.794
You don't believe
our history books?

50:23.796 --> 50:25.728
Some of them I do.

50:25.730 --> 50:27.663
For instance, the history
of Jesus Christ?

50:27.666 --> 50:31.068
He was the outcast.
The scapegoat.

50:31.070 --> 50:33.253
The black sheep.

50:33.255 --> 50:35.439
The troublemaker who created
a stir long ago

50:35.441 --> 50:37.007
in some of societies'
more refined...

50:37.009 --> 50:41.545
Most outsiders
are not saints or prophets.

50:41.547 --> 50:44.681
They're usually outside
for very good reasons.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.854
You like to live up
to the edge of your charm.

50:51.557 --> 50:54.191
But there's a remoteness.

50:54.193 --> 50:56.427
Probably some truth
to that.

50:57.530 --> 50:59.062
I have a pile of papers
to grade.

50:59.064 --> 51:03.033
You won't grade any papers again
anywhere ever

51:03.035 --> 51:05.002
if you don't cooperate.

51:09.642 --> 51:12.576
Do you think of yourself
as a good person?

51:12.578 --> 51:14.645
No.

51:14.647 --> 51:16.980
So you think
you're a bad person?

51:17.450 --> 51:19.032
No.

51:19.034 --> 51:20.617
What did you have at the Mercy?

51:20.619 --> 51:21.985
Tonic on the rocks?

51:21.987 --> 51:23.720
An orange juice?

51:23.722 --> 51:25.456
I can tell you
if you don't remember.

51:28.494 --> 51:32.095
What did my wife want
with Buster Heath?

51:34.467 --> 51:35.866
Ready?

51:36.235 --> 51:37.968
Wanna try again?

51:38.938 --> 51:41.972
What did my wife want
with Mr. Heath?

51:44.076 --> 51:47.211
What any lonely woman wants
at a nightclub,

51:47.213 --> 51:50.080
a decent proposition.

51:50.082 --> 51:53.517
I hope you're enjoying yourself.

51:53.519 --> 51:55.752
You'll be crying soon.

51:58.057 --> 52:00.991
While you're about it,
don't cry for me.

52:01.961 --> 52:04.728
Your wife was worried
about Mr. Heath.

52:04.730 --> 52:06.997
His state of mind
before the trial.

52:06.999 --> 52:10.100
She didn't wanna travel
to his seedy place all alone,

52:10.102 --> 52:11.535
so I went with her.

52:11.537 --> 52:12.936
Is that so confounding?

52:12.938 --> 52:16.940
What's confounding
is Mr. Heath is missing,

52:16.942 --> 52:21.578
my wife is missing,
Jean Fenny is missing,

52:21.580 --> 52:24.281
and Hobey Delmore
is also missing.

52:24.283 --> 52:25.983
Maybe your wife and Mr. Heath

52:25.985 --> 52:28.519
are at a colonial-style
motel together

52:28.521 --> 52:30.621
going over
the Gettysburg Address.

52:30.623 --> 52:33.306
I have no idea.

52:33.308 --> 52:35.992
As for Jean and Hobey,
he's quite the Casanova.

52:35.995 --> 52:40.664
They've all been gone about
the length of an elevator ride.

52:40.666 --> 52:44.001
Go easy on your contraband.
Have some patience.

52:44.003 --> 52:47.638
You seem to forget, there are
not only political checklists

52:47.640 --> 52:49.840
and errands in the night.

52:49.842 --> 52:52.142
There are also lovers.

52:58.951 --> 53:03.620
My pal, Commissioner Milo,

53:03.622 --> 53:08.325
is arriving at your cottage
right about now.

53:08.327 --> 53:10.961
He's not your pal.

53:10.963 --> 53:14.865
The front door
will probably be wounded.

53:19.872 --> 53:24.007
It's extremely dangerous
for women and children

53:24.009 --> 53:26.243
to be running around
these parts.

53:26.245 --> 53:28.579
There's a man in the woods.

53:28.581 --> 53:30.180
Surely you've heard?

53:30.182 --> 53:33.216
- A monster...
- I've heard, yes.

53:33.218 --> 53:37.254
I have never seen
and there's no proof.

53:38.724 --> 53:41.124
Why would anyone make him up?

53:41.126 --> 53:44.695
Anytime things don't go the way
they're supposed to,

53:44.697 --> 53:47.931
or we're humiliated

53:47.933 --> 53:51.068
or we see our reflection
and don't like it...

53:52.037 --> 53:54.271
There's a man in the woods.
He did it.

53:54.273 --> 53:57.941
And the most important thing is,
keep him in the woods.

53:57.943 --> 54:00.243
Keep him away in the dark.

54:01.714 --> 54:04.047
Why is that?

54:04.049 --> 54:07.818
If we saw him,
looked him in the eye.

54:07.820 --> 54:10.187
He might not be simply
a monster,

54:10.189 --> 54:12.756
he might be somewhat human.

54:12.758 --> 54:14.992
Then our neat little story
unravels

54:14.994 --> 54:18.028
and we have to deal
with ourselves.

54:18.030 --> 54:20.263
And who wants to endure
that drudgery?

54:23.002 --> 54:25.969
What did my wife
say about me to you?

54:29.308 --> 54:31.174
She said enough.

54:31.176 --> 54:34.077
And you believed
that very old woman?

54:34.079 --> 54:37.280
A woman I've been taking care of
my whole life?

54:37.282 --> 54:38.915
Spare me.

54:40.786 --> 54:43.153
I don't think I will.

54:43.155 --> 54:46.323
Go back to your goods
and chattels.

54:46.325 --> 54:50.060
You'll have time to catch
the last train out.

54:51.063 --> 54:52.429
Very well then.

54:57.069 --> 54:59.336
You realize, Ms. Roethke,

54:59.338 --> 55:02.839
by keeping information from
the higher authorities

55:02.841 --> 55:05.942
you've put many lives in danger.

55:07.246 --> 55:11.848
The only thing I've learned
in my time as a teacher

55:11.850 --> 55:13.850
is that higher authorities

55:13.852 --> 55:16.219
are the greatest danger
of them all...

55:18.157 --> 55:19.356
sir.

55:31.270 --> 55:34.371
You do have a history of mental
illness, don't you, Vivien?

55:34.373 --> 55:35.472
No.

55:35.474 --> 55:36.973
No?

55:37.443 --> 55:38.975
Well...

55:38.977 --> 55:41.178
I suppose it depends
on who you ask.

55:42.715 --> 55:44.081
I asked Dr. Fancher

55:44.083 --> 55:45.982
and the folks
at the local institution

55:45.984 --> 55:47.718
to which you've been
assigned twice.

55:47.720 --> 55:50.187
By my husband.
Assigned by my husband.

55:50.189 --> 55:52.389
With corroboration
from Dr. Fancher.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.157
You were having crack-ups.

55:54.159 --> 55:55.926
Dr. Fancher
has not studied psychology.

55:55.928 --> 55:57.894
He's an anesthesiologist.

55:57.896 --> 55:59.863
He's a quack
hired by my husband.

55:59.865 --> 56:01.431
Fancher is one
of the most respected...

56:01.433 --> 56:04.283
I suffer from depression

56:04.285 --> 56:07.136
and, uh, I don't like to be
in crowds, that's about it.

56:07.139 --> 56:10.040
But if they trump it up,
they'll say I'm a psychopath,

56:10.042 --> 56:12.909
and they can do anything to me
and it's not abuse, right?

56:12.911 --> 56:15.879
You say depression.
They say crazy.

56:15.881 --> 56:17.881
Tomato, tomato.

56:17.883 --> 56:20.117
You do see yourself
as a victim though.

56:21.186 --> 56:25.455
Of my karma, yes.
Of which I am the perpetrator.

56:28.060 --> 56:31.762
It's a sin to take someone's
dedication for granted.

56:32.898 --> 56:34.614
Shoot, if I went fruit loops,

56:34.616 --> 56:36.333
my wife would drop me
like a hot brick.

56:39.838 --> 56:41.271
Now, uh...

56:41.273 --> 56:46.042
I'm gonna ask you one more time
about last night.

56:56.388 --> 56:59.523
I like to think that
your silence is you considering

56:59.525 --> 57:01.792
the ins and outs of the evening.

57:03.328 --> 57:05.328
My silence
is me trying...

57:05.330 --> 57:10.033
trying very desperately
not to fucking scream.

57:14.072 --> 57:17.073
They call that
a medicine bundle.

57:17.075 --> 57:19.009
It's supposed to have
spiritual powers.

57:20.412 --> 57:22.345
What a fucking whack job.

57:25.217 --> 57:26.550
We'll find him.

57:27.519 --> 57:30.120
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

57:31.056 --> 57:33.356
The press
will be all over this soon.

57:35.294 --> 57:37.260
We'll find someone.

57:38.430 --> 57:40.096
Exactly.

57:55.214 --> 57:58.882
You know, I, uh, might
stop by your store one day.

57:58.884 --> 58:00.951
I picked up one of those
Ted Williams,

58:00.953 --> 58:03.520
you know, fly fishing reels.

58:03.522 --> 58:05.521
But I still haven't managed

58:05.523 --> 58:07.523
to reel in anything
of significance.

58:08.961 --> 58:11.862
Well.. Okay.

58:11.864 --> 58:13.530
- You looked into the water.
- Oh.

58:13.532 --> 58:15.866
You saw your own reflection,

58:15.868 --> 58:17.167
you still weren't Ted Williams.

58:17.169 --> 58:19.536
You still couldn't cast 95 feet.

58:20.505 --> 58:22.005
I'll... I'll level with you.

58:22.007 --> 58:23.573
In that scenario...

58:24.910 --> 58:27.544
Teddy Ballgame is the bait.

58:27.546 --> 58:29.880
Roebuck is the fisherman.

58:30.616 --> 58:32.582
You are the bone fish.

58:36.154 --> 58:38.889
Maybe...
Maybe so. Maybe so.

58:41.093 --> 58:43.994
My men tell me you've been
most obstructive

58:43.996 --> 58:46.712
to their investigating.

58:46.714 --> 58:49.431
Now they're just trying to do
their jobs. Why be a prick?

58:49.434 --> 58:53.036
I don't understand.
Aren't we all on the same team?

58:53.038 --> 58:56.139
We're all on the same team.

58:57.309 --> 58:59.376
But if there's no dissent...

59:00.445 --> 59:02.445
Then we're like
a zombie squad, you know.

59:02.447 --> 59:04.581
We become like a mob.

59:07.619 --> 59:09.419
- What race are you, sir?
- Huh?

59:09.421 --> 59:11.321
- What race are you?
- Italian.

59:12.991 --> 59:14.658
Nah.

59:14.660 --> 59:17.594
Nah. I'm Italian.

59:17.596 --> 59:19.329
You're... you're something else.

59:19.331 --> 59:21.331
Something else.

59:21.333 --> 59:24.134
You know, I got some Iroquois,

59:25.070 --> 59:27.236
some Cuban blood.

59:27.238 --> 59:29.405
I was... You know, I was told
not to advertise that.

59:29.408 --> 59:32.676
Thought it was bad,
bad for the shop, you know?

59:35.714 --> 59:37.647
Must be hard living a lie.

59:37.649 --> 59:39.316
It's a white lie.

59:39.952 --> 59:41.484
And it is at that.

59:44.222 --> 59:49.225
Say something germane, please.
It would behoove you.

59:51.396 --> 59:54.564
How can I leak
what I don't contain?

59:59.171 --> 01:00:02.505
Where did you get
that bump on your head?

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.377
I was listening to that song.

01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:11.797
- "Red Rooster."
- Oh, yeah.

01:00:11.799 --> 01:00:15.384
And, uh, you know, I began
to tripping the light fantastic.

01:00:15.387 --> 01:00:18.288
I forgot how klutzy I was,
and I slipped, and I slipped,

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:21.458
and I, you know... Bam!
You know, I...

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.194
"Red Rooster" always...
It always gets me, that one.

01:00:24.196 --> 01:00:26.062
I always end up injured. I...

01:00:27.766 --> 01:00:29.366
You know, I...

01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:34.237
I don't see a radio in here.

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:38.008
Even if I did, it would just be
all static out here.

01:00:39.277 --> 01:00:43.747
Oh, I meant... I meant
when it came on in my mind.

01:00:49.154 --> 01:00:50.352
Hmm...

01:00:50.354 --> 01:00:51.553
You know you can go to jail
for lying to us.

01:00:52.391 --> 01:00:54.691
I want you to think hard
on that.

01:00:56.228 --> 01:01:00.030
You can go to jail for wearing
the wrong pantaloons,

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:03.333
but if you could, would you
please just put me in the clink

01:01:03.335 --> 01:01:06.669
where my wife can't visit me.

01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:12.042
Hey, pro. This is Rudy.

01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:14.477
Rudy?

01:01:14.479 --> 01:01:17.347
Yeah, we...
we promised a sandwich.

01:01:17.616 --> 01:01:20.433
Oh.

01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:23.253
Well, uh, I was
just leaving anyway.

01:01:26.258 --> 01:01:28.591
Great to meet you,
Commissioner. I love the police.

01:01:28.593 --> 01:01:30.293
Well, we do our best.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:31.594
Yeah, sure. But you do
your best

01:01:31.596 --> 01:01:33.429
with such a consistency.

01:01:33.431 --> 01:01:35.265
You know, it's only consistency
and effort by you,

01:01:35.267 --> 01:01:37.266
and of course, the military.

01:01:37.268 --> 01:01:39.268
That's the only consistency
that's stopping commies

01:01:39.271 --> 01:01:43.640
from taking over this great
sovereign nation of ours.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.188
Why did you have to bring me
to this for, huh?

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.757
Oh, no. Don't worry.
You're not in this.

01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:05.728
Well, say
what they want you to say.

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:07.397
It's not worth it.

01:02:07.399 --> 01:02:10.366
We've talked about this
a million times.

01:02:10.368 --> 01:02:13.670
If you don't agree with them,
they are too dumb to debate.

01:02:13.672 --> 01:02:15.671
All resolved.

01:02:15.673 --> 01:02:17.673
They'll just bounce you
to a leper colony.

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:22.077
Rudy.

01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:25.380
Can you tell me now your theory
on why the sub Swiss mingles

01:02:25.383 --> 01:02:27.484
so well with mayo?

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:30.152
Your wife
is gonna find out

01:02:30.154 --> 01:02:31.854
about this whole deal
and call me.

01:02:34.326 --> 01:02:36.759
You tell her...
You tell my wife...

01:02:36.761 --> 01:02:40.230
That Barney Bacon
that they will have...

01:02:40.232 --> 01:02:43.466
Of course I think that LBJ
is up to the task.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.268
He's just what we needed.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.770
A real life Bronco Buckaroo.

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:57.747
You should've been a chef, Rudy.

01:03:00.685 --> 01:03:02.519
You should go, Ralph.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:05.255
Don't do this to yourself.

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:24.240
<i>♪ Meeting in smoky places ♪</i>

01:03:24.242 --> 01:03:28.478
<i>♪ Hiding in shadowy corners ♪</i>

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.315
You're gonna get me fired.
I told you stop coming by here.

01:03:32.317 --> 01:03:33.850
No, it's a new razor.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:36.018
I've been shaving religiously,

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.187
and my face is like the ass
of a baby Jesus now.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:40.190
Come on,
I have a newfound sensitivity.

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:42.274
Isn't it obvious?

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:44.359
Boy, you really know
how to romance a girl.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:46.362
I mean, you really take
the goddamn cake.

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.599
Oh, what? I suppose he's got
all the right words?

01:03:50.802 --> 01:03:52.669
There's something out there.

01:03:52.671 --> 01:03:54.520
No, there's not.

01:03:54.522 --> 01:03:56.372
Whenever it gets late
and the wind starts up,

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.640
you start in
on the ghost stories.

01:03:58.642 --> 01:04:00.909
Well, I'm a nervous person
which is not my fault.

01:04:00.912 --> 01:04:03.195
You've met my mother.

01:04:03.197 --> 01:04:05.481
It's hard not to considering
that you live with her.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.483
Oh, really?

01:04:07.485 --> 01:04:09.219
And what's
the implication there?

01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:12.871
Put it together.

01:04:12.873 --> 01:04:15.490
Consult the encyclopedia,
it's in the section A to Z.

01:04:16.328 --> 01:04:17.827
Just...

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:21.464
I'm pretty sure
there's something.

01:04:22.334 --> 01:04:23.933
Get away from there.

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:26.936
Get... No.

01:04:30.342 --> 01:04:31.841
Don't touch it.

01:04:44.656 --> 01:04:45.922
Dr. Fancher?

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:47.623
Is he expecting you?

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:49.324
He better be.
I'm getting my cast off.

01:04:49.326 --> 01:04:51.026
Doc better be prepped
and the whole works.

01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:52.895
Down the hall on your right.

01:04:53.732 --> 01:04:55.465
Um...

01:04:55.467 --> 01:04:58.835
Say, is it true
about last night?

01:04:58.837 --> 01:05:00.769
Is what true?

01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:02.704
About Jean Fenny, Hobey Delmore,
and that dirty cop and his dog

01:05:02.707 --> 01:05:04.274
getting dropped off here
last night,

01:05:04.276 --> 01:05:06.142
naked and half alive.

01:05:06.144 --> 01:05:08.010
I mean everyone's
been talking about it.

01:05:08.012 --> 01:05:09.878
Well, dogs are always naked.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.747
As for the rest of them,
that's none of your business.

01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:14.450
Well, they're my two
best friends.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.218
- Are they at least alive?
- They're upstairs.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.987
No, you don't give them
that information.

01:05:17.989 --> 01:05:20.356
Excuse you.

01:05:20.358 --> 01:05:22.959
What's your name?
I'm gonna get you fired.

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:26.296
What? You can't read, preppy?
It's right here on my name tag.

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:30.033
Yeah. Ah, Bone. Bo... Boney?

01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:32.718
Bonnie Earl.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.570
Oh, right. Bonnie.

01:05:34.572 --> 01:05:37.006
Ugly name for an ugly dame.

01:05:37.008 --> 01:05:38.708
Have a good day, Bonnie.

01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:43.780
Ida, you do not tell that boy
where our patients are.

01:05:43.782 --> 01:05:46.582
He said he was
their best friend.

01:05:46.584 --> 01:05:49.018
A boy like him
doesn't have any friends.

01:06:36.901 --> 01:06:39.035
Easy, easy, slugger.

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:41.704
- Where to? Water?
- Water.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:44.140
Yeah, we need you to stay
in this room.

01:06:44.142 --> 01:06:48.111
You're under investigation
for kidnapping two students.

01:06:48.113 --> 01:06:51.748
I mean, the numbers running
was one thing, Buster, but this?

01:06:52.517 --> 01:06:54.784
They're talking about the chair.

01:06:54.786 --> 01:06:58.388
I've always liked you, that's...
that's why I'm being frank.

01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:02.491
The man in the woods.

01:07:02.493 --> 01:07:05.594
No, no. We, uh,
we didn't find any fairy tales.

01:07:06.097 --> 01:07:07.964
We did find your truck though.

01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:11.667
Doesn't look good, buddy.

01:07:11.669 --> 01:07:13.936
If you thought you were
persona non grata before...

01:07:15.407 --> 01:07:18.441
I shot myself with an arrow
and I dropped myself off here?

01:07:18.443 --> 01:07:19.542
Yeah.

01:07:19.544 --> 01:07:21.611
We figured an accomplice.

01:07:23.047 --> 01:07:25.114
There's someone in the woods.

01:07:27.018 --> 01:07:29.886
So this someone drilled you
with an arrow

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:33.055
and then saved your life?

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.026
Yeah.

01:07:37.028 --> 01:07:40.963
Get back, I...
I have to close this.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.966
Where's Shirley?

01:07:43.968 --> 01:07:46.436
She woke up with froth
all over her mouth.

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:48.704
The vet said it might be rabies.

01:07:48.706 --> 01:07:50.740
We couldn't take any chances.

01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:42.492
Ms. Roethke said
to give this to you.

01:08:54.738 --> 01:08:56.171
Wait, wait, um...

01:08:57.575 --> 01:08:59.075
Do me a favor?

01:09:00.111 --> 01:09:01.810
Come here, quick.

01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:05.046
Can you take that razor

01:09:05.049 --> 01:09:07.817
and use it to scrape off
the Wite-Out here?

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:09.595
But you have to be very gentle

01:09:09.598 --> 01:09:11.375
because we can't ruin
what's underneath it okay?

01:09:11.377 --> 01:09:13.154
See what I've been doing?
I'm almost there.

01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:41.082
<i>My name is Louise Roethke.</i>

01:09:41.085 --> 01:09:43.920
<i>December 4th, 1963.</i>

01:09:43.921 --> 01:09:46.822
I'm sitting here
with Vivien Waldorf.

01:09:46.823 --> 01:09:50.560
I'm gonna ask Vivien
some questions about Red Damon.

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:52.862
First off, his name was not Red.

01:09:52.863 --> 01:09:55.097
Only people who didn't like him
called him that

01:09:55.099 --> 01:09:56.899
and not to his face.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:00.703
His birth name was Cha Oha.

01:10:00.705 --> 01:10:04.240
Outside of the family,
he went by Jim.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.175
Jimmy to his friends.

01:10:06.878 --> 01:10:08.778
You were his friend?

01:10:10.148 --> 01:10:12.048
We were madly in love.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:17.620
We kept it a secret.

01:10:17.622 --> 01:10:20.305
Although it was easier for Jimmy

01:10:20.307 --> 01:10:22.991
because he was always so hard
to read anyway.

01:10:22.994 --> 01:10:28.064
He would sit up all night
and have trance visions.

01:10:28.633 --> 01:10:30.983
He described it as

01:10:30.985 --> 01:10:33.336
going into the world between
existence and nonexistence.

01:10:34.739 --> 01:10:37.139
He said that
everything that we see

01:10:37.141 --> 01:10:40.843
is like a shadow
from the spirit world.

01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:43.746
And if you hear a bird

01:10:43.748 --> 01:10:46.315
and you know
that's in your chest...

01:10:47.752 --> 01:10:49.619
then you're awake.

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:57.059
We hold intellectual ability
in such high esteem here.

01:10:57.061 --> 01:10:59.795
But there is another aspect
to consciousness

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:04.000
which is not linear
or sequential.

01:11:04.002 --> 01:11:08.638
Does not rely on intellect
but on intuition.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.840
That's where Jimmy lived.

01:11:10.842 --> 01:11:13.843
Was it really
a drunk-driving incident?

01:11:13.845 --> 01:11:16.045
He never touched alcohol.

01:11:18.683 --> 01:11:20.983
He was not driving the car.

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:23.152
I was driving.

01:11:24.722 --> 01:11:28.758
We picked up a hobo hitchhiker
Jimmy insisted.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.994
It was icy that day, and, um...

01:11:34.198 --> 01:11:35.865
I skidded.

01:11:36.734 --> 01:11:38.401
Hit a school bus.

01:11:40.972 --> 01:11:45.174
When I came to,
I saw that the hitchhiker,

01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:48.678
his body had been launched
out the backseat

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.680
and his head was cut off.

01:11:52.817 --> 01:11:55.685
Jimmy pulled me out of the car.

01:11:55.687 --> 01:11:58.036
His teeth were gone.

01:11:58.038 --> 01:12:00.388
<i>They were smashed right out.</i>

01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:02.725
<i>He went back into the school bus</i>

01:12:02.727 --> 01:12:05.294
<i>which had also
partially exploded.</i>

01:12:05.296 --> 01:12:08.764
<i>And he brought out the kids,
the ones that weren't dead.</i>

01:12:08.766 --> 01:12:10.833
<i>He carried them in his jacket.</i>

01:12:10.835 --> 01:12:13.436
<i>His face was on... fire.</i>

01:12:18.976 --> 01:12:22.111
<i>I woke up in the hospital
the next day</i>

01:12:22.113 --> 01:12:26.482
<i>and the newspapers all said that
Jimmy had been driving the car.</i>

01:12:26.484 --> 01:12:28.451
<i>It was taken as gospel.</i>

01:12:36.928 --> 01:12:38.677
This number that's coming out

01:12:38.679 --> 01:12:40.429
from underneath the Wite-Out
makes no sense.

01:12:42.133 --> 01:12:44.133
What's the number?

01:12:44.502 --> 01:12:46.135
Here, here.

01:12:46.137 --> 01:12:51.340
The number that sit on top
of the Wite-Out was 9,636.

01:12:51.342 --> 01:12:53.442
Right. The number
Gabe Lehane was gunning for.

01:12:53.444 --> 01:12:59.014
Yeah, but this number
under the Wite-Out says 15,496.

01:13:04.222 --> 01:13:07.022
I'm going to the press
with this, with all of this,

01:13:07.024 --> 01:13:10.493
with the interview, the stats,
everything.

01:14:02.213 --> 01:14:04.213
Gabe?

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:07.483
I didn't know you knew Jean.

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.218
I don't, not really.

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.954
Um, I'm here
getting my cast off.

01:14:11.956 --> 01:14:13.956
I came to see you
but I saw her head.

01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:17.026
It looked kind of tilted so I...

01:14:17.862 --> 01:14:19.395
I thought you were dead?

01:14:19.397 --> 01:14:21.997
Me and the fellas,
we were pretty worried.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.465
The fellas?

01:14:23.467 --> 01:14:24.934
You guys have been giving me
the silent treatment

01:14:24.936 --> 01:14:26.368
for a long time now.

01:14:27.271 --> 01:14:29.371
I begged you
to stop ignoring me.

01:14:30.474 --> 01:14:32.241
What choice did we have?

01:14:33.444 --> 01:14:36.211
You betrayed us to get high.

01:14:36.213 --> 01:14:38.981
I mean, you were selfish.
You were always selfish.

01:14:38.983 --> 01:14:40.549
You never put the team first.

01:14:40.551 --> 01:14:44.119
This season, we're so damn good
that we don't really need you,

01:14:44.121 --> 01:14:46.322
but last season
we could've really used you.

01:14:51.262 --> 01:14:53.529
Well, I'm gonna sit
next to Jean for a minute.

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:57.066
Yeah, you sit with Jean.

01:14:57.869 --> 01:15:00.269
Sit with Jean, smug bastard.

01:15:02.874 --> 01:15:04.940
You know...

01:15:04.942 --> 01:15:07.109
I'm gonna break
Red Damon's record.

01:15:08.179 --> 01:15:10.546
You wouldn't know about that.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:13.883
Making a mark? A legacy.

01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:15.351
Becoming a legend?

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:19.455
Yeah, it's real for me now.

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:21.557
Yeah, I noticed.

01:15:23.961 --> 01:15:26.428
You had the hunger.
What happened?

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.267
I don't know. I...

01:15:31.269 --> 01:15:33.435
When you're marching down
the field and...

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.309
...trying to get more,
and more, and more, you know?

01:15:40.645 --> 01:15:43.012
More of what?

01:15:43.014 --> 01:15:45.514
It doesn't really matter what.
It's just more.

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:21.443
<i>♪ Oh, oh how I cried
On your wedding day ♪</i>

01:17:21.445 --> 01:17:27.549
<i>♪ Like, like my heart
Would break ♪</i>

01:17:27.551 --> 01:17:33.288
<i>♪ Oh, how you regret
Your wedding day ♪</i>

01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:39.428
<i>♪ Now paying
For your bad mistake ♪</i>

01:17:40.564 --> 01:17:43.098
Hey, what are you kids
doing here?

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.768
- We're her friends.
- We're sticking around.

01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:47.469
Very heartwarming.

01:17:47.471 --> 01:17:50.539
You know that window
shouldn't be open.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.808
Shut the nip out
will you, friends?

01:18:12.386 --> 01:18:17.386
