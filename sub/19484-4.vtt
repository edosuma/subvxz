08:11.282 --> 08:12.658
Let's do it!

20:43.116 --> 20:44.576
Gabrielle? How's it going?

20:47.162 --> 20:48.580
Is that beautiful Hélène?

23:47.843 --> 23:49.302
He never follows the rules.

30:28.117 --> 30:30.328
Some things are missing,
that's one thing.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.831
There are things
that aren't placed right either.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.250
How wrongly are they placed?

30:36.918 --> 30:41.005
It touches, so that there isn't room...

30:41.089 --> 30:42.882
-Oh, funny.
-Look.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.780
-This is the bar.
-That's the bar?

32:28.863 --> 32:30.281
So these gratings
are going in afterwards.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.491
The bar up there, right?

32:33.409 --> 32:35.036
It will be quite cool with the gratings.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.781
Do we have microphones on?

34:34.864 --> 34:38.618
Yes, but I don't think
they will use them.

34:38.701 --> 34:41.329
Can't you ask him to shut up?

34:42.371 --> 34:46.000
Oh, Fidel.
Can you shut the fuck up, dear Fidel?

36:20.761 --> 36:24.182
It's quite amazing
that this will be the children's hill.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.017
It begins all the way up there!

36:26.100 --> 36:28.186
It's high up,
even though it's the children's hill.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.187
Yeah, that's right.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.480
It's too cool!
