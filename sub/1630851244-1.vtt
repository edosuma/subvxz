WEBVTT

01:16.093 --> 01:17.429
Miss Angel?

01:18.296 --> 01:21.098
Camp's packed up
and ready to hit the trail.

01:21.131 --> 01:24.101
We should reach the outpost
by dusk, ma'am.

01:25.803 --> 01:27.339
Thank you, Mr. Foliet.

01:36.314 --> 01:38.916
<i>I've traveled
hundreds of miles from my home</i>

01:38.949 --> 01:41.885
<i>to a place some
has referred to as hell.</i>

01:41.919 --> 01:44.289
<i>A beautiful hell,
if you will.</i>

01:44.322 --> 01:46.790
<i>And tucked away
into this corner of the world</i>

01:46.824 --> 01:48.226
<i>that few have ever been</i>

01:48.260 --> 01:49.960
<i>is a world that might
only be fit</i>

01:49.994 --> 01:51.895
<i>for the devil himself.</i>

02:18.088 --> 02:20.458
<i>This is a land full of violence
where outlaws,</i>

02:20.492 --> 02:23.194
<i>pistoleers,
deserters and murderers</i>

02:23.228 --> 02:27.031
<i>have been calling home
for the past few years.</i>

02:27.064 --> 02:28.600
<i>But now that the great war
has ended,</i>

02:28.633 --> 02:31.001
<i>the east has vowed
to end terror</i>

02:31.035 --> 02:33.204
<i>and lawlessness
across the land.</i>

02:44.014 --> 02:45.983
<i>And so the capture
and the execution</i>

02:46.016 --> 02:48.620
<i>of evil men begins
as bounty hunters,</i>

02:48.653 --> 02:50.522
<i>scalpers and even the Army</i>

02:50.555 --> 02:52.990
<i>move in to exact their view
of law and order</i>

02:53.023 --> 02:55.993
<i>upon these expansive
yet bloody lands.</i>

03:00.498 --> 03:02.066
We close?

03:03.335 --> 03:05.503
The outpost is just
right up ahead.

03:07.572 --> 03:09.574
All right.

03:09.607 --> 03:12.377
<i>Man's idea of
civilization has arrived.</i>

03:12.410 --> 03:14.878
<i>Arizona is what they call it.</i>

03:18.015 --> 03:19.850
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

03:26.624 --> 03:29.461
All right.
Captain's up ahead here.

03:56.053 --> 03:59.056
- Captain.
- More lambs to the slaughter?

04:00.425 --> 04:02.427
This here is Annabelle Angel.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.096
I know who she is, Ebb.

04:06.130 --> 04:09.567
You arrived a bit earlier
than we originally expected.

04:12.136 --> 04:15.973
Apologies, sir,
but I had a wonderful guide.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.075
I do hope
I'm not intruding.

04:18.576 --> 04:20.043
Intruding?

04:20.077 --> 04:22.079
No.

04:22.112 --> 04:25.082
But I have a question to ask,
Miss Angel.

04:25.115 --> 04:29.421
Do thoughts of death
visit you often,

04:29.454 --> 04:31.556
or are you just
simple minded?

04:32.657 --> 04:35.393
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

04:35.427 --> 04:39.096
Simple minded would be
the answer, then.

04:39.129 --> 04:41.999
The reason I ask is because

04:42.032 --> 04:45.470
no respectable woman
in her right mind

04:45.503 --> 04:48.173
ventures to these parts.

04:48.206 --> 04:50.175
In fact, the only women
who ever come around here

04:50.208 --> 04:53.378
are looking to spread their legs
for a few pennies.

04:53.411 --> 04:56.079
You understand
my meaning now?

04:56.113 --> 04:59.517
I do, and my response
is quite simple, indeed.

04:59.551 --> 05:02.119
You are here to do a job,
if I'm not mistaken?

05:03.621 --> 05:05.156
Get to the point.

05:05.190 --> 05:07.024
I am as well, sir.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.327
It's the job that's made me
travel all these miles.

05:10.027 --> 05:14.265
Writing an article for,
what is it?

05:14.299 --> 05:16.301
<i>The San Francisco Examiner.</i>

05:16.334 --> 05:20.505
Right. And this stupid article
is worth possibly being raped

05:20.538 --> 05:22.574
and murdered,

05:22.607 --> 05:25.510
shot, cut,

05:25.543 --> 05:29.046
or otherwise maimed
in this godforsaken desert?

05:30.482 --> 05:32.049
It is.

05:33.585 --> 05:35.453
And this article,
it's gonna be on the men

05:35.487 --> 05:37.222
we're chasing down out here,

05:37.255 --> 05:40.425
and the good job
that my men are doing?

05:40.458 --> 05:42.059
Yes.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.027
Mm.

05:44.061 --> 05:45.497
Well, I don't have time

05:45.530 --> 05:49.066
to dig deeper into your logic,
Miss Angel,

05:49.099 --> 05:51.068
but please know

05:51.101 --> 05:53.505
that I cannot afford
any type of protection

05:53.538 --> 05:57.375
for you while you're here,
so you'll be on your own.

05:58.176 --> 06:00.345
I understand.

06:00.378 --> 06:03.448
And if any harm should
come to you while you're here,

06:03.481 --> 06:06.284
it will not be the fault
of the United States Army,

06:06.317 --> 06:10.154
and I better not read that
in any newspaper.

06:10.188 --> 06:13.056
The responsibility
of some crazy woman

06:13.090 --> 06:15.627
that wants to immortalize
herself in print

06:15.660 --> 06:17.462
will not be on my head.

06:17.495 --> 06:19.664
I'm not trying
to immortalize myself.

06:21.733 --> 06:23.234
Sir.

06:23.268 --> 06:24.736
Pardon?

06:24.769 --> 06:27.705
You say "sir"
when you address me.

06:29.507 --> 06:30.775
I've earned it.

06:30.808 --> 06:33.076
Ebb, show her
the lay of the land.

06:34.512 --> 06:37.315
You write your article true,
Miss Angel.

06:39.450 --> 06:42.620
You write about the cutthroats
and savages

06:42.654 --> 06:45.823
that we're trying to exterminate
from this land.

06:46.524 --> 06:48.560
Well, sir,

06:48.593 --> 06:51.563
I guarantee you that's exactly
what I'll be doing.

06:51.596 --> 06:53.398
Good.

06:53.431 --> 06:56.401
Then I expect to see you soon,
I should think.

07:01.172 --> 07:02.707
- Sir.
- Ebb.

07:06.311 --> 07:07.812
Crazy woman.

07:12.317 --> 07:14.819
Well, I'm sure that could've
gone a bit better.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.321
Is he always
that inviting?

07:16.354 --> 07:19.390
Miss Angel,
listen here now.

07:19.424 --> 07:22.327
Hensley ain't one to go
crossing around here.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.329
He's the whole show.

07:24.362 --> 07:27.899
He's just as dangerous as any
Joe, John and Harry out here,

07:27.932 --> 07:29.534
if not more so.

07:31.202 --> 07:33.838
The man has eyes and ears
all over.

07:33.871 --> 07:37.475
So walk lightly in his presence
if you want to avoid trouble.

07:38.843 --> 07:40.845
Are those words sticking
with you, Miss Angel?

07:43.314 --> 07:45.383
Right then.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.385
We should go
get you outfitted.

07:47.418 --> 07:49.554
Get you a place to stay.

07:49.587 --> 07:52.523
Hell, we leave now, we can get
to the Junction by nightfall.

07:52.557 --> 07:54.292
What's Junction?

07:55.727 --> 07:58.329
Just the place you wanted
to write about.

07:59.464 --> 08:01.232
See, those of us
who call this place home

08:01.265 --> 08:05.203
refer to it as a neutral
patch of land, if you will.

08:05.236 --> 08:06.771
Now, come on.

08:58.790 --> 09:00.324
Howdy.

09:07.532 --> 09:10.535
Well, this here's
the only supply stop.

09:15.740 --> 09:18.443
There's nothing north of us
but Injun territory.

09:20.912 --> 09:24.849
Now, most people around here
call this place home.

09:24.882 --> 09:29.353
Mostly because everywhere else,
there's a price on their head.

09:31.522 --> 09:34.325
Well, right over there,
that's a saloon.

09:34.358 --> 09:36.627
Or what we call one,
anyway.

09:36.661 --> 09:38.663
It's a rough place.

09:38.696 --> 09:40.998
You want some answers
or to find someone,

09:41.032 --> 09:43.034
that'd be your best bet.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.603
Right next to it
is Churtle B's Bathhouse.

09:45.636 --> 09:49.574
Nice hot mineral water comes
straight from the hot springs.

09:49.607 --> 09:51.976
Also plays home to most
of the whores in town.

09:54.946 --> 09:56.714
Right around,
trading post.

09:56.748 --> 09:59.951
Lanterns, wood, sheets,
you name it.

09:59.984 --> 10:02.620
Man who runs its name
is Deacon Sparry.

10:02.653 --> 10:04.522
Been here since
the camp's inception.

10:04.555 --> 10:06.891
Also one you might
want to talk to.

10:06.924 --> 10:08.760
Now...

10:08.793 --> 10:11.929
there's one thing to remember
here, Miss Angel,

10:11.963 --> 10:15.333
is that this place don't
quite like the Army much.

10:15.366 --> 10:18.302
They make a lot of coin
off them soldiers.

10:18.336 --> 10:20.371
Interesting sight, seeing some
of these boys in blue

10:20.404 --> 10:22.774
wandering around with the
likes of men you see here.

10:22.807 --> 10:26.410
Were it anywhere else, would be
at the other end of a rope.

10:27.745 --> 10:30.348
But they can't touch them
here in the Junction.

10:31.716 --> 10:33.684
You mean this place
is considered

10:33.718 --> 10:37.655
a safe haven for criminals,
Mr. Foliet?

10:37.688 --> 10:40.691
Well, Miss Angel,
you catch on quick.

10:40.725 --> 10:42.426
Why hasn't the Army
raided it?

10:42.460 --> 10:44.929
Listening to Captain Hensley
back there,

10:44.962 --> 10:47.398
you'd think this place
would be in ashes.

10:47.431 --> 10:49.734
The Army needs this
place just as much

10:49.767 --> 10:51.969
as everyone else does.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.739
It's an interesting arrangement.

10:54.772 --> 10:57.875
Which is why anywhere else
outside this place is dangerous.

10:57.909 --> 11:00.545
Army's been putting
bounties out.

11:00.578 --> 11:03.581
Attracting folk
from all over the country.

11:03.614 --> 11:05.416
They show up
looking to shoot the man

11:05.449 --> 11:07.952
whose face is printed
on that piece of paper.

11:07.985 --> 11:10.354
And the others?

11:10.388 --> 11:14.058
Ha! They're looking to shoot
the new faces that show up,

11:14.091 --> 11:17.061
'cause they figure they're
only here for one reason.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.963
Those bounties.

11:18.996 --> 11:22.333
Sounds like a very
violent type of life.

11:23.634 --> 11:25.102
Yup, yup.

11:25.136 --> 11:27.638
No truer statement's
ever been made, ma'am.

11:27.672 --> 11:29.807
Right over there,
that's your lodging.

11:29.841 --> 11:31.475
Go on in and talk to Vern.

11:31.509 --> 11:33.811
He's got a room arranged
for your stay.

11:33.845 --> 11:36.447
I suggest you get your
essentials in the morning,

11:36.480 --> 11:39.951
seeing it's getting to
be dark now and, uh, well,

11:39.984 --> 11:43.087
this town can get
a bit rowdy at night.

11:45.790 --> 11:48.893
You be real careful now,
Miss Angel.

11:50.094 --> 11:52.096
I'd hate to see
anything happen to you.

11:55.433 --> 11:56.734
Oh, no.

11:58.569 --> 12:00.071
All right.

12:01.206 --> 12:02.907
Thank you.

12:02.940 --> 12:04.508
Good night, ma'am.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.110
- Good night.
- Night.

15:43.794 --> 15:45.163
That's it now.
Who do you want?

15:45.197 --> 15:46.997
What you got in there?
You got going...

15:52.770 --> 15:55.039
Jericho Ford.

16:05.816 --> 16:08.253
I don't think we'd had the
pleasure of meeting, good sir.

16:08.286 --> 16:09.854
All right, gentlemen.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.689
Looks like we're
in time for a tussle.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.225
Who's taking bets?

16:13.258 --> 16:15.260
We got Gorn and Jericho.
Who's got what? What do you got?

16:17.995 --> 16:19.763
Oh, more to Jericho.

16:19.797 --> 16:21.665
Who do you want? You got Gorn?

16:21.699 --> 16:23.701
Right.

16:25.203 --> 16:28.105
Speak up, kid.
I think you're going for Gorn.

16:28.139 --> 16:30.275
I believe you want Gorn.

16:30.308 --> 16:34.379
You, sir, are an idiot
going for Jericho.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.747
You want Gorn or Jericho?

16:36.780 --> 16:38.350
We got one for Gorn
and Jericho.

16:38.383 --> 16:41.353
How about you pour me
a little shot there, baby?

16:43.321 --> 16:45.323
One for Jericho.
That's a bad bet, son.

16:45.357 --> 16:46.857
What do you got?

16:49.760 --> 16:52.096
All right. All right, gentlemen.
Good luck.

16:52.129 --> 16:54.366
You know I'm good for it.

16:54.399 --> 16:56.834
What are you looking at me for?

16:59.271 --> 17:00.905
Darn.

17:02.006 --> 17:04.040
Come on, Jericho.

17:04.074 --> 17:06.310
I've heard
a lot about you.

17:07.378 --> 17:09.381
I'm gonna enjoy this.

17:11.815 --> 17:13.117
Come on now, Gorn!

17:19.924 --> 17:21.259
Come on, Jericho.

17:22.294 --> 17:24.229
All hot air.

17:24.262 --> 17:26.829
No brass balls.

17:31.001 --> 17:33.837
Come on, Jericho!
Get him! Come on!

17:36.807 --> 17:38.243
Take him down!
That's it!

17:40.312 --> 17:42.247
Come on!

17:45.250 --> 17:46.884
Not a bad little fight.

17:46.917 --> 17:49.454
Looks like we got
ourselves a round two!

17:49.487 --> 17:50.955
Thanks for that.

17:52.157 --> 17:54.058
Well, that could've been
a bit more graceful.

17:54.091 --> 17:57.395
Graceful? I'm trying not to get
my head knocked off in there.

17:57.429 --> 18:00.432
You know, big things
fall hard, Jericho.

18:02.132 --> 18:04.236
Didn't you were in
for dinner and a show.

18:05.437 --> 18:07.272
All right.

18:11.108 --> 18:12.977
All right, here we go.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.313
Round two.

18:15.347 --> 18:17.014
Let's go!

18:34.499 --> 18:36.401
That's what I'm talking about.

18:36.434 --> 18:39.036
Finish him off!
Get in there, Gorn!

18:45.843 --> 18:48.213
Oh!

18:48.246 --> 18:49.913
Whoo!

18:49.947 --> 18:51.915
Get up there!
Come on, get up!

18:57.289 --> 18:59.291
Ain't no one
ring the bell yet?

19:02.893 --> 19:04.296
Come on!

19:09.133 --> 19:10.368
Use your head!

19:10.402 --> 19:11.569
Come on!

19:11.603 --> 19:13.438
What are you doing?

19:13.471 --> 19:14.872
Ante's on you, Jericho!

19:14.905 --> 19:16.474
Oh!

19:19.344 --> 19:21.479
He's on the ground!

19:21.513 --> 19:23.047
Finish him off!

19:23.080 --> 19:24.848
Don't let him get up! Come on!

19:24.882 --> 19:26.384
Oh!

19:26.418 --> 19:28.420
I felt that.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.542
Well...

19:53.077 --> 19:57.081
That is, as they say, that.

19:59.451 --> 20:01.186
You gonna be
at the Longfellow?

20:01.219 --> 20:03.053
I'll see you.

20:03.087 --> 20:05.156
All right, good.

20:37.155 --> 20:39.157
You best be careful
around here, lady.

20:39.190 --> 20:41.024
You might make a man
awful nervous,

20:41.058 --> 20:42.527
following him around
like you're doing.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.263
She ain't following you, Ford.

20:45.296 --> 20:48.233
Don't flatter yourself.

20:48.266 --> 20:50.402
She got better taste
in men than that.

20:51.034 --> 20:52.035
I do.

20:52.069 --> 20:53.405
I mean, I don't...

20:53.438 --> 20:55.540
I mean, I wasn't...

20:55.573 --> 20:58.243
Wait, let me get
my words about me.

20:59.244 --> 21:00.512
I wasn't following you.

21:00.545 --> 21:03.515
I just heard
the commotion outside.

21:04.282 --> 21:06.451
Hey. How'd we do?

21:07.685 --> 21:09.354
Good, boss.
Better than most nights.

21:09.387 --> 21:11.021
Yeah?

21:11.054 --> 21:13.324
And it's all here?

21:13.358 --> 21:14.459
No skimming.

21:14.492 --> 21:16.194
- Mm.
- No, sir.

21:16.227 --> 21:18.095
Here's what I want you to do.

21:19.564 --> 21:22.734
I want you to find us a couple
of bruisers for next week.

21:22.767 --> 21:24.968
- All right? Keep it coming.
- Yes, sir.

21:25.002 --> 21:27.070
And here, put this
in the till.

21:27.104 --> 21:28.273
Yes, sir.

21:28.306 --> 21:30.375
No skimming.

21:31.242 --> 21:33.110
You did good, Ford.

21:34.479 --> 21:37.047
I ought to give
you more free booze.

21:38.616 --> 21:41.486
Now, don't let
Jericho here fool you.

21:41.519 --> 21:43.521
He's just spent a little
too much time in the sand

21:43.555 --> 21:45.223
with the snakes,

21:45.256 --> 21:48.626
and he's forgotten how to treat
a respectable woman.

21:48.660 --> 21:51.529
- Says who?
- Says me.

21:51.563 --> 21:53.731
Now, um...

21:53.765 --> 21:55.400
You.

21:56.668 --> 21:58.770
I don't seem
to remember you around,

21:58.803 --> 22:02.005
and I know pretty much
every face in town.

22:02.039 --> 22:05.777
Yours is not a face
I'd forget.

22:05.810 --> 22:08.045
My name's Annabelle Angel, sir.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.215
Ah. The reporter lady.

22:10.248 --> 22:11.516
That's correct.

22:11.549 --> 22:14.051
Mm-hm. Yeah,
Ebb told me about you.

22:14.084 --> 22:16.287
Said, uh...

22:16.321 --> 22:18.189
...he says some fair-haired
light-skinned woman

22:18.223 --> 22:21.493
might come in here with a set
of legs and ask for stories.

22:23.428 --> 22:25.730
Is that what you're doing?
Looking for stories?

22:25.763 --> 22:27.565
What can I get you?

22:27.599 --> 22:30.368
You want some water
or tea or milk?

22:30.401 --> 22:31.569
Whiskey.

22:34.272 --> 22:36.139
Whiskey it is.

22:36.174 --> 22:37.575
Forgive me if I am mistaken,

22:37.609 --> 22:39.644
but you're who this
establishment belongs?

22:41.546 --> 22:43.715
Well, that's an interesting way
to put it, but...

22:45.416 --> 22:47.752
I am who this
establishment belongs.

22:47.785 --> 22:49.354
Yes, ma'am.

22:49.387 --> 22:51.422
The name's
Albert Longfellow.

22:51.456 --> 22:54.759
This is indeed my spot,
and you can call me Al.

22:58.329 --> 23:00.265
Please, Mr. Longfellow,
join me for another.

23:03.368 --> 23:05.370
Certainly. Yes, ma'am.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.173
So how long you been here?

23:09.841 --> 23:11.409
Oh, since the beginning.

23:11.442 --> 23:13.244
Since the beginning.

23:13.278 --> 23:15.847
The beginning of time.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.517
Since Eve gave Adam
the apple.

23:21.819 --> 23:24.589
You know, it wasn't long after
that that the Army moved in,

23:24.622 --> 23:28.058
and then they started poking
their nose around these parts.

23:28.826 --> 23:30.261
You're a reporter lady.

23:30.295 --> 23:32.062
You might maybe
look into that.

23:36.668 --> 23:38.101
Cheers.

23:38.135 --> 23:39.771
Well, what are we cheersin'?

23:39.804 --> 23:42.307
To you being my first
friend in this place.

23:45.677 --> 23:46.878
So...

23:46.911 --> 23:49.514
Annabelle Angel.

23:50.548 --> 23:51.883
Is that a pseudonym?

23:51.916 --> 23:53.651
No.

23:53.685 --> 23:56.354
So, what kind of paper
would bring you around here,

23:56.387 --> 23:58.556
check out us forgotten souls

23:58.590 --> 24:00.224
here in the
most desolate part

24:00.258 --> 24:02.560
of the new
United States of America?

24:02.594 --> 24:04.896
- <i>San Francisco Examiner.</i>
- Oh.

24:04.929 --> 24:07.165
George Hearst's Publication?

24:08.399 --> 24:10.468
You know your press.

24:10.501 --> 24:14.137
They sent a lady reporter?

24:14.172 --> 24:15.773
They actually weren't
going to send anybody.

24:15.807 --> 24:17.542
I volunteered.

24:18.343 --> 24:19.577
Ah.

24:20.812 --> 24:23.848
That's the fifth hand
in a row, Pike.

24:23.881 --> 24:27.518
Ain't nobody that goddamn lucky.

24:33.791 --> 24:35.727
No need for all
the commotion, boys.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.563
Everybody here, just let's
have an honest game

24:38.596 --> 24:40.632
and a nice stiff drink.

24:40.665 --> 24:42.834
I'm sure Al would appreciate it
if you took this outside

24:42.867 --> 24:44.869
before it escalates
any further.

24:46.804 --> 24:48.706
Fewer words, Buck.

24:49.540 --> 24:51.409
What are you implying?

24:51.442 --> 24:55.813
I'm calling you a two-bit
hack of a gambler

24:55.847 --> 24:57.915
who cheats at cards.

25:04.789 --> 25:06.391
Now, then...

25:07.925 --> 25:10.561
What do you suggest we do?

25:12.363 --> 25:14.565
I assume you have
some sort of plan,

25:14.599 --> 25:16.868
being that you're
calling me a cheat.

25:17.769 --> 25:19.604
Or am I wrong,

25:19.637 --> 25:21.439
and you are just a man
with loose lips

25:21.472 --> 25:23.841
who cannot hold
their liquor?

25:23.875 --> 25:27.512
You are really a scurvy bastard,
ain't you, Pike?

25:28.780 --> 25:32.850
What kind of a name
is Oslo Pike anyway?

25:33.551 --> 25:35.553
Jesus. Al!

25:35.586 --> 25:38.890
I don't believe this is
any of your concern, woman.

25:38.923 --> 25:40.658
Hey!

25:42.827 --> 25:45.430
Y'all know the rules, boys.

25:45.463 --> 25:48.533
That sign ain't up
there for decoration.

25:55.039 --> 25:56.808
Well, would you
like me to walk him

25:56.841 --> 25:59.343
all the way to the river
before I shoot him there?

26:01.479 --> 26:02.747
Would that make it
so your night

26:02.780 --> 26:04.949
is no more interrupted,
Christine?

26:04.982 --> 26:06.617
You ain't shooting nobody.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.793
"Dost thou seal our souls
to heaven or hell?"

26:15.827 --> 26:17.895
asked the reaper.

26:18.763 --> 26:20.698
"To hell," responds God.

26:20.732 --> 26:24.469
And hell was filled with
a thousand screaming voices.

26:28.372 --> 26:29.874
You're quite the poet.

26:31.342 --> 26:32.910
I think you've done
enough here tonight.

26:32.944 --> 26:35.546
You can just take
your money and go.

26:45.389 --> 26:47.692
Now, you saw that.
They drew first.

26:49.427 --> 26:51.529
I'd consider that justified.

26:51.562 --> 26:53.664
Wouldn't you, Al?

26:55.466 --> 26:57.401
For the mess.

27:01.439 --> 27:02.774
Hello, Ford.

27:03.841 --> 27:05.510
Heard you were
scrapping outside.

27:05.543 --> 27:06.911
How'd that turn out for you?

27:08.079 --> 27:10.414
Well, I'm still here,
ain't I?

27:10.448 --> 27:12.650
No bite marks
or bullet holes.

27:12.683 --> 27:14.585
Yeah. Yet.

27:17.688 --> 27:19.590
Well, uh...

27:19.624 --> 27:21.692
what are you
carrying there?

27:24.095 --> 27:26.798
Oh, I got $5 says I could put
all six rounds in you

27:26.831 --> 27:29.467
before you can even pull that
out of your holster.

27:30.601 --> 27:32.670
Want to make a wager?

27:32.703 --> 27:36.107
Gee, that sounds like
an awfully good time, but, uh,

27:36.140 --> 27:39.477
I'm gonna have to decline
your generous offer.

27:40.611 --> 27:42.413
Too much of a yellow belly, huh?

27:42.446 --> 27:43.981
Ha.

27:44.015 --> 27:46.017
You know, I'd call it...

27:47.451 --> 27:50.488
smart, tired and drunk.

27:52.023 --> 27:55.459
And I can only assume that you'd
want me at my best, Pike.

27:56.427 --> 27:58.329
Or would I be mistaken?

27:59.831 --> 28:01.599
All right.

28:01.632 --> 28:04.602
You've had your pound
of flesh for the night, Oslo.

28:06.137 --> 28:08.840
And my hospitality for you
has run out for the night,

28:08.873 --> 28:13.544
so why don't you go
slither away?

28:18.749 --> 28:20.585
You're the boss, Al.

28:24.922 --> 28:26.724
Be seeing you, Ford.

28:38.970 --> 28:41.706
Sometimes you need
two shotguns.

29:17.508 --> 29:20.077
Well, well, well.
What we got here, boy?

29:22.180 --> 29:23.714
Good morning.

29:23.748 --> 29:25.816
And good morning to you too.

29:27.618 --> 29:29.553
What's a pretty little
thing like you

29:29.587 --> 29:33.057
doing all the way out here
by yourself, Miss...?

29:35.860 --> 29:37.061
Angel.

29:37.094 --> 29:39.130
Annabelle Angel.

29:39.164 --> 29:41.732
I was just taking
a walk, is all.

29:41.766 --> 29:43.634
Trying to find
the river, actually.

29:47.172 --> 29:49.106
Is that so? Angel?

29:49.140 --> 29:51.709
That's a last name,
ain't it?

29:51.742 --> 29:53.678
Well, the riverbed's
just over yonder there.

29:53.711 --> 29:56.480
Kind of dry this
time of season, though.

29:58.183 --> 30:00.818
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:00.851 --> 30:01.953
I'll be on my way.

30:01.986 --> 30:06.023
What's you in
such a hurry for?

30:06.057 --> 30:09.493
I'm writing this story
for the newspaper.

30:09.527 --> 30:11.095
Story?

30:11.128 --> 30:14.031
On how well the Army's doing
to keep this place safe.

30:15.233 --> 30:17.034
We are doing a good job,
ain't we, boys?

30:17.068 --> 30:19.070
- We are.
- For sure.

30:19.103 --> 30:23.908
You know, it's nice to be
rewarded every once in a while.

30:26.544 --> 30:28.913
You know, for providing
our services.

30:28.946 --> 30:30.915
Wouldn't you agree?

30:32.049 --> 30:33.651
I'm sure you could find
plenty of reward

30:33.684 --> 30:35.287
in this place
you call a town.

30:35.320 --> 30:40.024
Gets a little boring,
seeing the same faces

30:40.057 --> 30:43.794
over and over
and over again.

30:45.029 --> 30:47.232
You know, I asked
the good Lord...

30:47.265 --> 30:49.100
I did, I asked him.

30:49.133 --> 30:52.636
...if he would send me a real
little angel, just like you.

30:54.572 --> 30:56.574
Fair to say you think my prayers
have been answered?

30:56.607 --> 30:58.142
Come on over here, darling.

30:58.176 --> 31:00.644
It's all right, darling.

31:05.816 --> 31:07.852
Lower that damn gun and we'll be
gentle with you now.

31:07.885 --> 31:09.920
Get back! Get back!

31:09.954 --> 31:11.756
Get back, I said.

31:12.957 --> 31:14.658
Look at you.

31:14.692 --> 31:17.695
By the looks of it,
you trembling with that gun.

31:17.728 --> 31:20.298
You ain't never shot a gun
a day in your life.

31:20.332 --> 31:22.133
Ain't that right?

31:22.167 --> 31:25.569
Oh, Jesus!
She shot me in the ear!

31:27.239 --> 31:29.707
Does anybody else not want
to listen to a lady?

31:36.348 --> 31:39.116
Whichever way this ends,
you die today.

31:45.323 --> 31:47.691
Are you boys lost?

31:50.228 --> 31:52.863
Can't you tell you interrupting
something here, mister?

31:52.897 --> 31:54.232
Mr. Ford, thank God.

31:56.067 --> 31:58.069
Stay back.

31:58.102 --> 32:00.004
Drop the gun.

32:03.408 --> 32:06.744
I'm gonna take the girl
and we're gonna be on our way.

32:06.777 --> 32:08.979
Go on, keep moving.

32:11.216 --> 32:13.150
I got a tickle telling me

32:13.185 --> 32:15.153
I'm gonna smoke
your friend here.

32:15.187 --> 32:16.887
And I'm gonna take
your ear with me.

32:16.921 --> 32:19.357
Look, there's no need
for violence here.

32:19.391 --> 32:23.060
Let the lady go and we'll all
be the better for it.

32:23.094 --> 32:25.896
You ain't in no position
to be giving me orders.

32:25.930 --> 32:28.200
It wasn't an order.
It was a suggestion.

32:28.233 --> 32:30.701
Well, what's the damn
difference, then?

32:30.734 --> 32:34.138
Well, if it was an order,
it would sound like this.

32:34.172 --> 32:37.641
Let the girl go and you can walk
out of here alive.

32:45.015 --> 32:46.784
You're him.

32:48.018 --> 32:49.954
He's on the captain's wall.

32:49.987 --> 32:52.123
Well, then what the hell
are y'all waiting for?

32:59.964 --> 33:02.766
Stay there. Stay there.

33:04.902 --> 33:06.171
Stay back, goddamn it.

33:06.204 --> 33:09.006
I'll cut her from one ear
to the other.

33:09.039 --> 33:10.641
I swear, I will.

33:11.909 --> 33:14.346
Then I'm gonna
ask you again.

33:14.379 --> 33:17.349
Please, let the nice woman go.

33:18.149 --> 33:19.984
If I let her go,

33:20.017 --> 33:21.419
you're gonna kill me.

33:21.453 --> 33:24.121
And if you's really
on the captain's wall,

33:24.156 --> 33:28.260
that makes you a murderer,
you no-good...

33:34.064 --> 33:35.933
Mr. Ford.

33:51.249 --> 33:54.084
Oh, the wanderer awakes.

33:54.118 --> 33:57.389
You are safe here.
No harm will come to you.

33:57.422 --> 33:59.857
Good thing we came along
when we did.

34:01.359 --> 34:04.728
The White soldiers care not
for anything here.

34:07.165 --> 34:09.434
You were the one
firing at the soldiers.

34:11.503 --> 34:13.304
Thank you.

34:13.338 --> 34:15.839
Thanks are no good here.

34:15.873 --> 34:19.210
Anybody who values life
and has compassion

34:19.244 --> 34:21.446
would've done
the same thing.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.382
I'm not sure I believe that.

34:25.417 --> 34:30.821
Why does a White woman walk
alone in a place such as this?

34:30.853 --> 34:33.291
Well, I was looking
for the river.

34:33.324 --> 34:35.393
The river runs dry.

34:36.228 --> 34:37.795
So I was told.

34:38.929 --> 34:40.498
Where is Mr. Ford?

34:40.532 --> 34:44.436
He's outside indulging himself
in some fire water.

34:48.938 --> 34:50.242
Morning.

34:51.842 --> 34:54.945
What the hell
are you still doing here?

34:54.978 --> 34:57.382
Thought you'd be on your way
back to the Junction by now.

34:57.415 --> 34:59.517
This ain't no place
for you out here, lady.

34:59.551 --> 35:03.120
Well, I do want
to say thank you.

35:06.358 --> 35:08.393
What?

35:09.827 --> 35:11.396
You both live here?

35:11.429 --> 35:14.432
Yes, this White buffalo
and I share company together

35:14.466 --> 35:17.302
when he's not living
in the bottom of a bottle.

35:17.335 --> 35:19.170
Who are you calling
a White buffalo?

35:20.305 --> 35:23.441
Well, now that
you've met Wasco here

35:23.475 --> 35:26.211
and he's seen you to wake,
you can be on your way now.

35:26.244 --> 35:28.946
Leave us to our rather
simple life.

35:28.979 --> 35:31.915
Hosting company
is not a strength of yours.

35:32.983 --> 35:35.453
Well, I like
my peace and quiet.

35:35.487 --> 35:37.322
Mr. Ford, if it's okay,

35:37.355 --> 35:39.890
I'd love to ask you
a few questions.

35:39.923 --> 35:41.459
For what?

35:41.493 --> 35:44.362
Oh, that fancy article
you're writing, huh?

35:44.396 --> 35:47.465
The one where you paint us out
to be all murderous thieves

35:47.499 --> 35:49.900
living in caves,
slaughtering women and children?

35:51.902 --> 35:55.005
That's a lot of assumptions
as to what I might write.

35:55.039 --> 35:57.342
I've seen quite the opposite,
have I not?

35:57.375 --> 35:59.877
He will answer questions.

36:03.415 --> 36:05.883
I swear,
if we weren't friends...

36:11.256 --> 36:13.924
Then you'd have been dead
a long time ago.

36:15.059 --> 36:17.295
Come, sit by the fire.

36:17.329 --> 36:21.031
Warm we must keep,
for the snow will be here soon.

36:21.065 --> 36:24.034
Fire, fire, fire.
Fire makes the world go around.

36:25.069 --> 36:26.904
White man made fire,
you know.

36:30.241 --> 36:31.975
He did not.

36:55.433 --> 36:56.934
Captain?

36:56.967 --> 36:58.603
What is it?

37:08.546 --> 37:10.315
We, uh...

37:12.149 --> 37:13.585
Spit it out.

37:14.985 --> 37:16.354
What happened, Private?

37:18.021 --> 37:20.124
We was ambushed, sir.

37:21.559 --> 37:23.428
Ambushed?

37:24.329 --> 37:26.331
Ambushed by who?

37:26.364 --> 37:28.600
Speak, son,
and be detailed.

37:28.633 --> 37:33.171
We was escorting that reporter
lady through the Junction,

37:33.204 --> 37:36.006
down by the barn...

37:36.674 --> 37:40.110
and a man jumped us.

37:40.144 --> 37:42.547
And how many of you
were there?

37:44.416 --> 37:46.384
Three, sir.

37:46.418 --> 37:49.987
So one man took on three
military-trained individuals

37:50.020 --> 37:51.656
and came out the victor?

37:54.159 --> 37:55.260
No, sir.

37:55.293 --> 37:57.162
I'm certain
that he had help.

37:57.195 --> 38:00.398
Rifle fire came
from somewhere else.

38:02.099 --> 38:04.101
So two men
did this, then?

38:05.236 --> 38:07.037
That'd be my guess, sir.

38:08.239 --> 38:09.607
Well, what about the girl?

38:13.244 --> 38:14.579
They, uh...

38:14.612 --> 38:16.681
They absconded with her, sir.

38:16.714 --> 38:19.317
Stay away from
big words, Private.

38:19.350 --> 38:21.118
They don't agree with you.

38:21.151 --> 38:24.054
Did you get a look
at these men?

38:24.456 --> 38:26.191
One.

38:26.224 --> 38:29.694
I got a real good
up-close look at one, sir.

38:31.362 --> 38:33.130
And what did he look like?

38:36.568 --> 38:38.303
It was him.

38:49.112 --> 38:50.682
This man?

38:58.756 --> 39:02.293
Muster an escort for me.
I'm going to Apache Junction.

39:04.462 --> 39:06.531
- Sir.
- What is it?

39:08.833 --> 39:11.202
He killed your boy, sir.

39:17.074 --> 39:18.576
John's dead?

39:20.110 --> 39:21.579
Yes, sir.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.482
Sorry, sir.

39:28.553 --> 39:31.021
Boy never was
too bright anyway.

39:32.657 --> 39:34.192
Go on.

39:43.368 --> 39:45.102
But he was a soldier.

39:46.504 --> 39:49.340
And justice will roll
like a river,

39:49.374 --> 39:52.610
righteousness like
a never-ending stream.

40:05.557 --> 40:08.192
How'd you both find this place?
How'd you come to meet?

40:08.226 --> 40:10.461
One question at a time, lady.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.465
I was born here,
me and my people.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.167
And where are they now?

40:22.874 --> 40:24.642
I came out
from the plains.

40:24.676 --> 40:27.478
Drove cattle out there
for a while until the war hit.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.280
And then?

40:30.782 --> 40:33.384
You're just a mighty bit nosy,
ain't you?

40:33.418 --> 40:35.587
That's my job.

40:35.620 --> 40:38.323
Well, I'd be looking for
a more respectable occupation,

40:38.356 --> 40:39.724
if you ask me.

40:39.757 --> 40:41.225
Says the outlaw.

40:41.259 --> 40:42.794
Who said I'm a wanted man?

40:42.827 --> 40:45.229
Alas, what would
a respectable occupation be

40:45.263 --> 40:47.198
for me anyways,
Mr. Ford?

40:47.231 --> 40:49.867
Gander a guess
that you come here

40:49.901 --> 40:52.537
because you've done
something awful bad.

40:52.570 --> 40:56.441
Unlike your compatriot Wasco,
who was born in this land,

40:56.474 --> 40:57.875
you had to migrate here.

40:57.909 --> 40:59.644
And from my understanding,

40:59.677 --> 41:01.646
the men that learned
to call this place home are...

41:01.679 --> 41:03.781
Murderers and thieves.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:03.815 --> 41:05.283
Like I said, lady,

41:05.316 --> 41:06.784
you is nosy,
and exactly why no one

41:06.818 --> 41:09.520
respects a person
of your occupation.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.522
Jericho came out west

41:11.556 --> 41:14.492
because he did not want
to fight the great war.

41:15.893 --> 41:17.595
So you left
before it started?

41:18.496 --> 41:20.298
Well, it didn't make sense

41:20.331 --> 41:22.800
to go fighting
other people's battles.

41:24.402 --> 41:27.238
The White man's drink
does funny things to the mind.

41:27.271 --> 41:29.173
All right, that's enough.

41:29.207 --> 41:31.209
No, it's important
that she knows

41:31.242 --> 41:33.478
how this relationship
was forged.

41:34.746 --> 41:36.547
Jericho took a bad fall
hunting one day.

41:36.581 --> 41:41.352
Me and my people took him in,
saw that he was healed.

41:42.387 --> 41:43.755
The Army offered a reward

41:43.788 --> 41:46.224
for any Indian brought in,
dead or alive.

41:49.327 --> 41:52.497
You know, I know I got a bottle
around here somewhere.

41:52.530 --> 41:55.633
Army men arrived one day.
Began to do what they do best.

41:55.667 --> 41:58.236
I know I have a
bottle around here somewhere.

42:01.639 --> 42:03.241
Murder.

42:03.274 --> 42:05.576
Jericho decided
to respond back with lead.

42:05.610 --> 42:08.579
And that was
the end of the story.

42:10.014 --> 42:12.517
These lands
have seen enough bloodshed

42:12.550 --> 42:15.253
to last a lifetime,
Miss Annabelle.

42:15.286 --> 42:17.755
It's never in our
best interest to spill more.

42:19.357 --> 42:21.659
We all have a history
that brought us here.

42:21.693 --> 42:23.428
But like my people before,

42:23.461 --> 42:25.997
we've all been written
to be the devil

42:26.030 --> 42:28.499
in a land that's
not theirs to give.

42:40.812 --> 42:42.547
Well...

42:42.580 --> 42:44.348
would appear to be quite
the party, then.

42:44.382 --> 42:46.451
Mary what the hell are you doing
out here all by yourself?

42:46.484 --> 42:49.587
I am a grown woman.
I think I can handle myself.

42:49.620 --> 42:51.989
Oh, yeah, that's what this one
thought earlier today,

42:52.023 --> 42:54.826
till Hensley's troops tried
to raise her skirt.

42:56.461 --> 42:57.695
Are you okay, darling?

42:57.729 --> 42:59.263
They didn't hurt you,
did they?

42:59.297 --> 43:00.932
No, they didn't...

43:00.965 --> 43:03.968
thanks to Mr. Ford
and Mr. Wasco here.

43:05.536 --> 43:06.871
What happened?

43:12.343 --> 43:14.612
Well, I might've had
to shoot one of them.

43:14.645 --> 43:16.581
Three.

43:17.882 --> 43:19.417
Three?

43:19.450 --> 43:21.886
Yeah, that does sound
more accurate.

43:21.919 --> 43:25.289
Those military boys
will be up in arms, Jericho.

43:25.323 --> 43:26.924
You know it as well
as anyone.

43:28.793 --> 43:30.895
I'm afraid we haven't
had the chance to meet yet.

43:30.928 --> 43:33.965
Yeah, this here
is the newspaper lady.

43:33.998 --> 43:35.466
Annabelle Angel.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.768
Mary...

43:36.801 --> 43:38.436
Primm.

43:40.037 --> 43:42.940
I brought some
fresh vegetables...

43:43.841 --> 43:45.877
and something to drink.

43:45.910 --> 43:47.879
Yes.

43:48.813 --> 43:50.982
Mwah! Sweet Jesus.

43:52.416 --> 43:53.951
Good.

43:55.753 --> 43:57.355
What about you, Annabelle?

43:57.388 --> 43:59.690
- What you like?
- Some bread, please.

44:00.958 --> 44:02.994
- I got you covered.
- Thank you.

44:06.831 --> 44:08.533
It's horrible, you know?

44:08.566 --> 44:11.002
All those women and children,
just defenseless.

44:11.035 --> 44:13.070
Slaughtered in
the middle of the night.

44:13.104 --> 44:14.906
No badge could help that.

44:14.939 --> 44:17.408
They'd have needed
their own army.

44:17.441 --> 44:19.677
I guess you can't change
the past, now can you?

44:26.417 --> 44:27.819
Evening, Al.

44:31.122 --> 44:32.790
Captain.

44:36.994 --> 44:39.664
What the hell did we do for him
to grace us with his presence?

44:40.932 --> 44:43.067
Should I fetch the scattergun,
Miss Williams?

44:43.100 --> 44:46.370
No, Al's got it behind the bar.
Just go about your business.

44:49.707 --> 44:53.477
Place looks good.
Business looks better.

44:53.511 --> 44:56.414
What the hell
are you doing here?

44:57.548 --> 44:59.817
Is that any way
to greet an old friend?

45:00.252 --> 45:02.019
We got rules.

45:02.053 --> 45:03.688
You're breaking them.

45:05.022 --> 45:06.958
Oh, yeah.

45:06.991 --> 45:10.695
We don't come looking for wanted
men here at the Junction,

45:10.728 --> 45:15.666
and our outpost continues
to receive goods and services.

45:16.834 --> 45:18.502
An honorable agreement.

45:18.536 --> 45:22.907
Yet, beyond counterproductive
to my work, Al.

45:22.940 --> 45:25.142
It's kept you fed.

45:25.177 --> 45:26.911
Kept you clothed.

45:26.944 --> 45:30.481
You hear to balk
at that agreement?

45:30.514 --> 45:33.618
Miss Williams,
the mouth that never closes.

45:34.685 --> 45:36.721
Don't you have
a brothel to run?

45:36.754 --> 45:39.056
You don't have a dog
in this fight.

45:39.090 --> 45:40.858
Well, it's worked so far,

45:40.892 --> 45:43.394
so I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

45:44.229 --> 45:45.830
What are you doing here?

45:45.863 --> 45:47.765
Well, it appears...

45:47.798 --> 45:50.468
And, of course,
I'm just guessing here.

45:50.501 --> 45:52.204
That one of your customers

45:52.237 --> 45:55.072
dispatched some of
my soldiers this morning.

45:55.907 --> 45:58.809
Well, that's unfortunate.

45:58.843 --> 46:03.681
However, it did not happen
within the confines of my walls,

46:03.714 --> 46:05.783
so it doesn't make it
my problem, does it?

46:06.918 --> 46:08.786
So I'm guessing
it's out of the question

46:08.819 --> 46:11.156
to ask you if
you've seen this man.

46:11.956 --> 46:13.457
Out of the question.

46:13.491 --> 46:15.993
- Out of the question.
- Christine...

46:16.027 --> 46:17.995
let me to my business.

46:18.029 --> 46:20.765
Al, if I wanted to,
I could gather all the men

46:20.798 --> 46:23.668
at my disposal and march them in
this shitty little town of yours

46:23.701 --> 46:25.036
and burn it to the ground.

46:26.637 --> 46:27.838
Meat and grain and women,

46:27.872 --> 46:30.175
all those things
are replaceable.

46:30.208 --> 46:32.576
So all these many years
that I've let you

46:32.610 --> 46:34.078
keep these walls standing

46:34.111 --> 46:36.514
and keep me from the one step

46:36.547 --> 46:37.982
that I need to make
to completely

46:38.015 --> 46:41.186
obliterate the lawlessness
in this territory,

46:41.219 --> 46:43.688
I'm asking you to do
one thing for me now.

46:43.721 --> 46:47.058
You tell me the next time
you see this man.

46:48.193 --> 46:49.827
And for the rest of you...

46:51.163 --> 46:52.697
I know there's many men in here

46:52.730 --> 46:54.232
that I'd love
to show the noose

46:54.266 --> 46:57.501
and see them ride the pine
straight to the devil.

46:57.535 --> 47:00.071
But I lost soldiers today,

47:00.104 --> 47:03.275
and an innocent civilian
in the form of that reporter

47:03.308 --> 47:05.910
from San Francisco
got kidnapped.

47:07.144 --> 47:11.283
So I'm offering a bonus
of up to $200

47:11.316 --> 47:15.119
for the man or men
that bring me Jericho Ford.

47:16.620 --> 47:18.756
I want him dead or alive.

47:18.789 --> 47:20.891
Dead would be preferable.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.695
What about that girl
you were talking about?

47:24.729 --> 47:27.732
Extra $50 if you find her.

47:27.765 --> 47:31.569
If not, I'll consider
her a casualty of war.

47:34.605 --> 47:37.141
It's been fun, Al.

47:37.175 --> 47:39.910
I know I'll be hearing
from you very soon.

47:40.345 --> 47:41.679
Let's go.

47:47.018 --> 47:49.720
No way Ford done
what he said, Al.

47:49.754 --> 47:51.922
He's not that kind of man.
You know it, I know it.

47:51.956 --> 47:54.091
Yeah? Are you sure
about that, Christine?

47:56.027 --> 48:01.032
With all the trash and hooligans
running around this town?

48:02.967 --> 48:05.203
I know a good man
when I see him.

48:06.371 --> 48:08.039
You certainly do.

48:09.673 --> 48:12.610
I'll tell what's more
important than innocence.

48:12.643 --> 48:14.845
Survival.

48:14.879 --> 48:16.914
- Hmm.
- The way I look at it,

48:16.947 --> 48:20.017
we got a lot more outlaws than
Army boys around these parts.

48:21.286 --> 48:22.853
So if you're
starting to think

48:22.887 --> 48:24.922
that you might want
to turn Ford in, well...

48:26.358 --> 48:28.260
You don't think these hooligans
might start thinking

48:28.293 --> 48:30.628
the honorable Al Longfellow
might do the same thing to them

48:30.661 --> 48:32.797
if the opportunity
presented itself?

48:36.934 --> 48:40.004
If it was me, I'd start
sleeping with one eye open

48:40.037 --> 48:41.806
and my hand clutched
around my pistol,

48:41.839 --> 48:43.841
if I was gonna
head down that road.

48:45.976 --> 48:47.645
You're a smart woman.

48:47.678 --> 48:50.014
Hmm. That I am.

49:11.135 --> 49:13.003
Thank you.

49:17.342 --> 49:20.044
It's different, right?

49:21.712 --> 49:23.281
What's that?

49:23.315 --> 49:26.150
It's different from what you
thought you'd find here?

49:28.152 --> 49:30.654
I wasn't exactly sure
what to expect.

49:33.791 --> 49:36.428
Society has this
place pegged as

49:36.461 --> 49:40.898
a ruthless land
full of criminals.

49:40.931 --> 49:43.734
And Captain Hensley and his
agenda clearing out the rabble

49:43.767 --> 49:48.105
to make way for
a proper civilization.

49:48.139 --> 49:50.674
At least, I am assuming
that is how the rest

49:50.708 --> 49:52.676
of our newfound
United States

49:52.710 --> 49:54.111
views our little corner
of the world

49:54.145 --> 49:56.147
that we've carved out
for ourselves.

49:57.748 --> 50:00.218
They never had a chance
to think any different.

50:02.487 --> 50:04.389
You can be that chance.

50:08.293 --> 50:11.128
There are people here that are
just trying to live their lives.

50:12.730 --> 50:16.734
They like having
a small piece of earth

50:16.767 --> 50:18.903
where they aren't
judged every day.

50:19.904 --> 50:21.239
We all may be misfits,

50:21.273 --> 50:24.476
but it helps it go
down a bit smoother,

50:24.509 --> 50:26.444
you know, when society
ain't inflicting its view

50:26.478 --> 50:28.313
of law and order upon us.

50:31.449 --> 50:33.918
What about the ones
that actually have done

50:33.951 --> 50:36.154
the unspeakable
in their past?

50:36.188 --> 50:39.123
How does one justify
the continued freedom

50:39.157 --> 50:41.825
to the loved ones who have
had someone or something

50:41.859 --> 50:43.694
taken from them?

50:44.496 --> 50:46.364
Honey...

50:46.398 --> 50:50.968
I have learned that bad people
get what they deserve

50:51.001 --> 50:52.970
in some form or another.

50:54.539 --> 50:57.141
Whether that be now
or ten years from now,

50:57.175 --> 51:00.077
Lord and the devil alike
see that justice be done.

51:01.279 --> 51:03.747
You can't let bad people
go unpunished.

51:03.781 --> 51:06.484
There has to be some sort
of law and order, Mary.

51:07.519 --> 51:09.820
Yeah, I suppose there does.

51:14.226 --> 51:15.826
Don't let
the view fool you.

51:15.859 --> 51:18.463
This place has
its disadvantages.

51:20.831 --> 51:22.800
Like what, exactly?

51:25.303 --> 51:27.272
Look at me, Annabelle.

51:28.806 --> 51:30.342
I'm a whore.

51:32.177 --> 51:35.180
As long as I stay here,
I'll always be a whore.

51:36.348 --> 51:38.849
But that's your decision,
is it not?

51:38.882 --> 51:41.852
There's nothing else here.
Not for women.

51:41.885 --> 51:44.356
I'm not sure I believe
that to be true.

51:45.089 --> 51:46.890
You've seen it.

51:46.924 --> 51:48.393
The looks you get.

51:48.426 --> 51:52.129
No one can believe
someone like you is here.

51:53.565 --> 51:57.502
They haven't seen a woman
with freedom of expression.

52:00.538 --> 52:02.207
You could leave.

52:04.509 --> 52:06.076
Not without him.

52:10.382 --> 52:12.116
You love him?

52:13.184 --> 52:15.152
I think I do.

52:15.186 --> 52:17.921
I'm gonna put
that in my story.

52:17.955 --> 52:21.259
- What's that?
- That this place isn't lost.

52:21.293 --> 52:23.361
That there's warmth here.

52:23.395 --> 52:25.996
Kindness and love exist.

52:30.602 --> 52:32.404
Have you told him yet?

52:32.437 --> 52:33.837
No.

52:36.508 --> 52:38.310
Why not?

52:41.579 --> 52:43.348
A man like Jericho Ford
doesn't want to spend

52:43.381 --> 52:46.451
the rest of his life
with a whore.

52:46.484 --> 52:49.920
Well, my observations tell
quite a different story, Mary.

53:03.401 --> 53:05.270
I'll be back tomorrow.

53:07.505 --> 53:09.374
Don't burn the camp down
while I'm away.

53:09.407 --> 53:11.875
Stay away from the drink,
my friend.

54:12.069 --> 54:13.904
It's okay.
You're okay.

54:16.106 --> 54:17.908
You're okay.

54:24.716 --> 54:26.551
Goodbye, Mary.

54:26.584 --> 54:29.287
Oh, I'm sure I'll be seeing
you soon enough, Annabelle.

54:30.622 --> 54:33.425
I'm gonna walk Miss Primm
back to her residence.

54:39.197 --> 54:42.667
If you like, you're welcome
to follow me back when I leave.

54:46.638 --> 54:48.038
What?

54:48.071 --> 54:50.040
Wasco likes the company, is all.

54:50.073 --> 54:52.343
She's educated.
He likes that sort of thing.

54:52.377 --> 54:54.446
Gives him someone to talk to.

54:54.479 --> 54:56.681
I would love to,
Mr. Ford.

54:56.714 --> 54:58.750
I'll just grab a couple things
from my room?

54:58.783 --> 55:00.485
Yeah, take your time.

55:00.518 --> 55:03.020
I got to go to Al's
and get me a bottle or two.

55:03.053 --> 55:06.056
Go to the store.
Wasco needs spices.

55:12.530 --> 55:14.566
Since when did you get a heart?

55:14.599 --> 55:17.100
Woman, I've always
had one.

55:17.134 --> 55:20.371
It's been sitting right here,
beating away each and every day.

55:20.405 --> 55:22.039
Is that so?

55:22.072 --> 55:23.541
That's a fact.

55:28.546 --> 55:31.048
You're a good man,
Jericho Ford.

55:32.684 --> 55:36.019
I'm a lucky girl to have
someone like you in my life.

55:38.055 --> 55:39.624
No, you ain't, Mary. I...

55:42.594 --> 55:45.363
I should be doing a hell
of a lot better by you, Mary.

55:49.434 --> 55:50.668
Someday.

55:50.702 --> 55:54.472
Someday, we'll leave
this place.

55:54.506 --> 55:56.541
We'll leave this place,

55:56.574 --> 55:58.676
and all the baggage
that comes with it.

56:00.678 --> 56:03.080
I guess we all got to stop
running sometime, right?

57:13.451 --> 57:16.487
<i>The blood-soaked
lawless sands of Arizona</i>

57:16.521 --> 57:19.257
<i>are not what they would appear.</i>

57:19.290 --> 57:21.492
<i>I have found the
beginnings of friendship</i>

57:21.526 --> 57:23.394
<i>in a few of the residents here.</i>

57:23.428 --> 57:26.898
<i>Upper-class society will
condemn them as criminals,</i>

57:26.931 --> 57:28.900
<i>traitors, savages, even.</i>

57:28.933 --> 57:31.603
<i>But I have now witnessed
the blossoming buds</i>

57:31.636 --> 57:34.137
<i>of love and hope
in a place that before,</i>

57:34.172 --> 57:36.708
<i>I never would've
thought possible.</i>

57:36.741 --> 57:39.644
<i>This place still has many faces
that it has not yet shown,</i>

57:39.677 --> 57:42.614
<i>but if the hospitality
I have received so far</i>

57:42.647 --> 57:45.650
<i>is any indication of
this place and its people,</i>

57:45.683 --> 57:50.521
<i>it is not what the modern world
would have everyone believe.</i>

57:50.555 --> 57:52.557
<i>The only real monsters
I have encountered</i>

57:52.590 --> 57:56.694
<i>were the ones that were put
here to protect people like me.</i>

57:56.728 --> 57:58.763
<i>Irony weaves a winding road.</i>

58:08.906 --> 58:11.542
It's a little empty
in here, ain't it?

58:12.710 --> 58:14.379
We closed today.

58:15.747 --> 58:17.582
Five years I've been
coming to this joint,

58:17.615 --> 58:19.350
and I never seen you close.

58:22.954 --> 58:25.556
The Captain came
and paid us a visit.

58:28.226 --> 58:31.696
He said you shot
some of his boys...

58:34.532 --> 58:36.901
and you kidnapped
that reporter lady.

58:36.934 --> 58:39.604
Yeah, those boys
were gonna rape her.

58:39.637 --> 58:42.540
But she's here right now
in her hotel room.

58:42.573 --> 58:44.942
By her own free will.

58:46.477 --> 58:48.379
If I don't do something,

58:48.413 --> 58:51.549
they're gonna burn it
all down, Ford.

59:01.726 --> 59:04.362
I known you a long time, friend.

59:04.395 --> 59:07.231
And I said to myself,

59:07.265 --> 59:11.636
"No, I don't think Jericho
kidnapped no woman."

59:15.373 --> 59:18.443
But I had to give him something,
you understand?

59:21.612 --> 59:23.581
Not really, Al.

59:29.454 --> 59:31.856
I had to break
my own rules, Jericho.

59:39.831 --> 59:44.035
That's the best
I can do for you, Ford.

59:44.068 --> 59:46.571
You have to shoot your own way
out of this one. Go on.

59:51.843 --> 59:53.411
Give 'em hell, Ford.

59:55.546 --> 59:56.981
For all of us.

01:01:41.018 --> 01:01:42.954
Sorry.

01:01:42.987 --> 01:01:44.488
Come on.

01:02:43.047 --> 01:02:44.949
All right,
I think we lost them.

01:02:45.883 --> 01:02:48.753
We got to get back to Wasco.

01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:58.930
Mr. Ford?

01:02:58.963 --> 01:03:00.731
We'll go out the back.

01:03:03.868 --> 01:03:05.736
I think I've been shot.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.004
No.

01:03:09.674 --> 01:03:11.509
Okay. It's okay,
Annabelle.

01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:13.110
We just need to get you
back to camp, all right?

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:15.479
Wasco's gonna fix you up.
He's gonna fix you up.

01:03:15.513 --> 01:03:18.449
It's okay, it's okay.

01:03:42.974 --> 01:03:44.675
Hello, Mary.

01:03:52.717 --> 01:03:55.686
Wasco! Wasco!

01:03:56.988 --> 01:03:58.656
Wasco!

01:03:58.689 --> 01:04:00.691
Wasco!

01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:04.562
- What happened?
- They were waiting for me.

01:04:04.595 --> 01:04:06.864
- Who?
- The soldiers. Higgins' boys.

01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:09.033
They attacked you
while you were in camp?

01:04:09.066 --> 01:04:10.701
That's not part
of the agreement.

01:04:10.735 --> 01:04:12.570
There's no more agreements.

01:04:12.603 --> 01:04:14.239
The bullet went through.

01:04:14.272 --> 01:04:16.841
We'll need some clean water,
some cotton,

01:04:16.874 --> 01:04:18.709
either from your shirt
or from your pillow.

01:04:18.743 --> 01:04:20.212
I do not care which.

01:04:20.245 --> 01:04:21.979
Well, is she gonna be okay?
Is she gonna live?

01:04:22.013 --> 01:04:25.250
As long as you move quickly,
we can save her life.

01:04:27.151 --> 01:04:30.155
You'll be okay, my dear.
I promise you.

01:04:56.814 --> 01:04:58.316
Sir?

01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:01.118
This man claims to have
information about Jericho Ford.

01:05:08.959 --> 01:05:11.196
Information, huh?

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:15.599
Oh, I never claimed
to have the information.

01:05:16.301 --> 01:05:19.136
What good are you to me?

01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:23.741
She is the one
with the information.

01:05:23.774 --> 01:05:27.245
I say again, what good
are you to me, then?

01:05:29.013 --> 01:05:33.751
I am the hilt in which the hand
holds to do its bidding, sir.

01:05:36.053 --> 01:05:38.390
I don't have time
for riddles.

01:05:38.423 --> 01:05:40.091
Speak plainly.

01:05:40.124 --> 01:05:43.195
I just watched Jericho
fend off an infamous gang

01:05:43.228 --> 01:05:45.663
known as the
Higgins Boys, now...

01:05:47.332 --> 01:05:49.267
I am confident
that I am the only one

01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:51.902
who can kill Jericho Ford.

01:05:53.305 --> 01:05:57.242
Otherwise, you can keep sending
your men to do the job,

01:05:57.275 --> 01:05:58.943
but your bill to the undertaker?

01:05:58.976 --> 01:06:01.346
Well, that's gonna keep
getting more expensive

01:06:01.379 --> 01:06:03.181
as the days wane on.

01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:07.818
The men out there
are speaking as if this

01:06:07.852 --> 01:06:10.388
Ford cannot be killed.

01:06:11.223 --> 01:06:13.124
But I say,

01:06:13.158 --> 01:06:16.794
"If a man can bleed,
he can surely die."

01:06:17.462 --> 01:06:18.729
You.

01:06:18.762 --> 01:06:20.831
Who are you in all of this?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.002
I'm no one.

01:06:25.035 --> 01:06:28.038
Well, clearly you're
somebody of importance

01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:29.940
in this situation.

01:06:31.343 --> 01:06:34.078
If I may.

01:06:34.111 --> 01:06:37.815
I do believe I can extract
the information out of her,

01:06:37.848 --> 01:06:39.783
given my methods.

01:06:40.918 --> 01:06:42.686
Who are you?

01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:47.259
Won't matter somewhere.

01:06:48.926 --> 01:06:51.128
The name's Oslo Pike.

01:06:51.163 --> 01:06:53.731
And what do you want
out of all this?

01:06:53.764 --> 01:06:55.267
The money?

01:06:56.168 --> 01:06:57.701
No.

01:06:58.736 --> 01:07:00.338
Two things
and two things only.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.410
First, I want my name
free and clear.

01:07:05.443 --> 01:07:07.711
I believe you can do that
with a simple letter

01:07:07.745 --> 01:07:09.447
over to a Mr. Wells
in Nebraska,

01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:13.050
explaining how my
services were exemplary

01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:15.052
in the catching and killing

01:07:15.085 --> 01:07:17.121
of a notorious criminal
in these parts.

01:07:18.088 --> 01:07:20.057
And the second thing?

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:23.328
I want the honor
of killing Jericho Ford.

01:07:25.062 --> 01:07:26.964
How do you plan
on doing that?

01:07:26.997 --> 01:07:30.335
I am faster than he is.

01:07:30.368 --> 01:07:32.970
You make this sound like
a dime novel, Mr. Pike.

01:07:33.003 --> 01:07:35.873
Oh, there have been plenty
of them written about me, sir.

01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:39.777
Oslo Pike.

01:07:41.213 --> 01:07:43.448
Bellevue, Nebraska.

01:07:45.283 --> 01:07:48.786
And you don't want
any of the money?

01:07:50.155 --> 01:07:53.425
Fame and fear will
buy you the world, Captain.

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:55.793
I have tasted both,

01:07:55.826 --> 01:07:57.229
and clearly the
killing of Mr. Ford

01:07:57.262 --> 01:08:00.365
is surely gonna
bring me more, therefore,

01:08:00.398 --> 01:08:03.168
I do not require
your physical currency.

01:08:04.902 --> 01:08:07.071
You're an interesting
character, Mr. Pike.

01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:09.207
Do we have a deal?

01:08:16.413 --> 01:08:17.948
Yes.

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:21.252
Now...

01:08:22.487 --> 01:08:25.022
Have you ever seen
an eyeball pop?

01:08:27.057 --> 01:08:29.160
It is a most
interesting sight.

01:08:29.194 --> 01:08:31.196
You see...

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:35.267
when a sharp object
punctures it,

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.935
it just deflates
like a balloon.

01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:40.171
Some say that there is no pain.

01:08:43.308 --> 01:08:45.477
You see, but the fear
is not losing the eyes.

01:08:47.245 --> 01:08:49.145
It's more complex.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.251
When you're plunged
into complete darkness...

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:58.022
there's no telling
where the blade might cut next.

01:09:01.892 --> 01:09:03.560
Hmm.

01:09:05.596 --> 01:09:08.999
They say a person can
withstand a thousand cuts.

01:09:10.635 --> 01:09:13.069
Surely that would be painful.

01:09:14.071 --> 01:09:15.273
Close your eyes.

01:09:17.242 --> 01:09:19.843
Uh-huh. Close them.

01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:23.581
Go on. Close them.

01:09:23.615 --> 01:09:25.450
I said close them!

01:09:31.921 --> 01:09:34.124
Now I'm gonna give you
one chance to tell me

01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:36.993
where Jericho's camp is,
and if you do not,

01:09:37.027 --> 01:09:38.462
not only will
I take your eyes

01:09:38.496 --> 01:09:40.432
and shroud you
into eternal darkness,

01:09:40.465 --> 01:09:42.300
but I will make sure
you are so disfigured

01:09:42.334 --> 01:09:44.502
that even dogs will walk away
at the very sight of you.

01:09:48.005 --> 01:09:50.040
Open your eyes.

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:53.444
You look at me.

01:09:57.114 --> 01:09:59.950
Where is he?

01:10:15.233 --> 01:10:16.934
She will live.

01:10:21.373 --> 01:10:26.244
I've seen that look in
your eye many times before.

01:10:27.479 --> 01:10:29.347
Jericho.

01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:31.148
Jericho, where are
you going?

01:10:31.182 --> 01:10:33.184
Jericho, where are you going?

01:10:33.218 --> 01:10:35.953
- What do you think?
- To kill someone?

01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:37.555
Is it so obvious?

01:10:37.589 --> 01:10:39.357
That will solve nothing.

01:10:39.391 --> 01:10:41.992
I don't need any
of your preaching today.

01:10:43.528 --> 01:10:45.230
Just let me get it done.

01:11:01.379 --> 01:11:04.549
You know, you start
coming into these odd

01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:07.385
sort of bivouac

01:11:08.051 --> 01:11:09.587
shantytowns.

01:11:09.621 --> 01:11:11.156
Sometimes you want a break.

01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:13.324
I was gonna take a vacation.

01:11:14.426 --> 01:11:16.927
Take some days off
for myself.

01:11:17.629 --> 01:11:19.564
I got a kid at home.

01:11:21.633 --> 01:11:23.133
Shelby.

01:11:27.539 --> 01:11:29.374
A man's still
gotta make a living,

01:11:29.407 --> 01:11:32.477
and I am just well within
my lawful rights

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:35.012
to pursue the type of
living that I'm doing.

01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:37.315
Pour that drink, Jose.

01:11:52.797 --> 01:11:55.132
You know,
you took the lives...

01:11:57.335 --> 01:11:59.737
of a few folk who were
quite dear to me.

01:12:01.606 --> 01:12:03.441
Turn around.

01:12:03.475 --> 01:12:05.677
I don't like to shoot
a man in the back.

01:12:08.446 --> 01:12:11.081
Well, I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

01:12:34.572 --> 01:12:36.341
Be a shame to waste it.

01:13:00.298 --> 01:13:02.032
This seems familiar.

01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:08.773
Is it bad?

01:13:08.806 --> 01:13:11.175
You'll live to
fight another day.

01:13:14.279 --> 01:13:16.581
Where's Mr. Ford?

01:13:16.614 --> 01:13:19.350
Returning soon.
Try to get some rest.

01:13:46.344 --> 01:13:49.714
Where are you, boy?
Come home now. Come home.

01:14:56.314 --> 01:14:57.682
Ford.

01:14:57.715 --> 01:14:59.283
Where is he?

01:14:59.317 --> 01:15:00.885
I do not know.

01:15:00.918 --> 01:15:04.889
Suppose you don't have any idea
when he'll be back, then?

01:15:04.922 --> 01:15:06.591
Do you?

01:15:10.461 --> 01:15:13.665
You know, I've killed
a lot of people before.

01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:19.470
But I've never killed
no Injun before.

01:15:20.705 --> 01:15:24.609
It's no more pleasurable
than taking any life.

01:15:24.642 --> 01:15:26.944
Oh, I doubt that very much.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.315
You see,
I think your death

01:15:31.349 --> 01:15:34.952
is gonna contribute
greatly to my cause.

01:15:34.986 --> 01:15:39.891
Evil men live only long enough
to see their end.

01:15:41.859 --> 01:15:44.595
Well, I guess we must
all die sometime.

01:16:10.722 --> 01:16:13.758
You tell Ford to meet me
at the thoroughfare.

01:16:31.409 --> 01:16:33.311
Wasco.

01:16:33.344 --> 01:16:34.912
Annabelle.

01:16:42.987 --> 01:16:44.889
I'm sorry.

01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:47.992
I'm sorry.

01:16:54.332 --> 01:16:56.033
I'm so sorry.

01:17:16.821 --> 01:17:18.723
It ain't your fault.

01:17:18.756 --> 01:17:20.591
It ain't your fault.

01:17:20.625 --> 01:17:22.360
I should've been here.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.729
I should've been here.

01:17:38.643 --> 01:17:40.845
It was that man.

01:17:48.786 --> 01:17:50.755
Pike.

01:18:07.505 --> 01:18:08.973
Jericho?

01:18:11.609 --> 01:18:13.077
What are you gonna do?

01:18:16.848 --> 01:18:19.483
I'm gonna see
if the devil can bleed.

01:19:03.895 --> 01:19:05.763
You take up refuge
near Al's.

01:19:05.796 --> 01:19:07.465
Now, once Mary's free,

01:19:07.498 --> 01:19:09.600
you two stay by each other's
sides, all right?

01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:17.074
You know how to use one?

01:19:18.476 --> 01:19:20.144
Okay, then.

01:19:20.178 --> 01:19:21.879
Off you go.

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.981
Good to see you, Ford.

01:20:01.186 --> 01:20:03.754
I'm very glad
you could join us.

01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:07.024
You see, Mary here...

01:20:08.226 --> 01:20:10.661
She was getting a bit lonely.

01:20:16.534 --> 01:20:17.902
And I thought
I was eventually

01:20:17.935 --> 01:20:20.771
gonna have to put her
out of her misery.

01:20:28.612 --> 01:20:30.881
Glad you showed up
when you did.

01:20:39.191 --> 01:20:42.660
I see you brought you own
personal autobiographer.

01:20:48.032 --> 01:20:49.667
You talk too much.

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.003
Been accused of that, yes.

01:20:52.703 --> 01:20:55.106
Let her go, Pike.

01:20:57.641 --> 01:20:59.043
Go on, Mary.

01:21:00.278 --> 01:21:02.947
Go give one last goodbye
to your love.

01:21:14.658 --> 01:21:16.194
Are you okay?

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:21.766
Annabelle's over there.
You go join her.

01:21:22.767 --> 01:21:24.035
Anything happens,

01:21:24.068 --> 01:21:26.804
you both take
the horses and get.

01:21:38.682 --> 01:21:41.319
I love you,
Jericho Ford.

01:21:45.623 --> 01:21:47.024
Go on now.

01:21:56.301 --> 01:21:58.969
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:01.639
It's often hard
you find someone

01:22:01.672 --> 01:22:03.074
you think is worthy
of something like this.

01:22:03.107 --> 01:22:05.643
Goes back hundreds
of years, you know.

01:22:06.211 --> 01:22:07.945
Dueling, that is.

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.682
Oh, I'm familiar
with my history.

01:22:11.715 --> 01:22:13.984
What do you propose?

01:22:14.785 --> 01:22:16.188
Simple, really.

01:22:17.255 --> 01:22:18.989
Each round, we draw.

01:22:19.023 --> 01:22:22.194
Each round,
we get one shot.

01:22:22.227 --> 01:22:24.795
First man to fall
is the loser.

01:22:26.664 --> 01:22:28.200
Perfect.

01:22:39.377 --> 01:22:40.911
He'll win.

01:22:41.912 --> 01:22:44.748
He has to win.

01:22:44.782 --> 01:22:46.984
Nothing is certain
in this life, honey.

01:22:47.017 --> 01:22:50.788
All we can do is pray
that Jericho's faster.

01:24:21.413 --> 01:24:22.947
Ah!

01:25:36.254 --> 01:25:38.223
That's for my friend.

01:25:56.073 --> 01:25:58.209
<i>It was exactly
like I had read about.</i>

01:25:58.243 --> 01:26:02.079
<i>A showdown between two men
to see who was the fastest.</i>

01:26:02.112 --> 01:26:04.182
<i>But as most would seek fame,</i>

01:26:04.215 --> 01:26:07.552
<i>I found one who was seeking
salvation and love.</i>

01:26:07.585 --> 01:26:10.355
<i>A different type of gunslinger
than one would think.</i>

01:26:10.388 --> 01:26:13.558
<i>A different kind
of an outlaw altogether.</i>

01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:01.406
Goodbye, my old friend.

01:27:04.108 --> 01:27:05.577
<i>Just any
other place in the world,</i>

01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:08.380
<i>loss was a factor of life here.</i>

01:27:08.413 --> 01:27:12.116
<i>A consequence of
violence by violent men.</i>

01:27:51.088 --> 01:27:52.490
<i>But still, life goes on.</i>

01:27:52.524 --> 01:27:54.992
<i>And like Mary Primm
once told me,</i>

01:27:55.025 --> 01:27:57.562
<i>"Bad people do get
what they deserve."</i>

01:27:59.431 --> 01:28:01.166
What is it?

01:28:07.772 --> 01:28:10.642
Leave me.

01:28:10.675 --> 01:28:12.444
<i>Some men aren't
made for the wild,</i>

01:28:12.477 --> 01:28:14.646
<i>and those that believe
that they can tame it</i>

01:28:14.679 --> 01:28:17.415
<i>might lose more than
they can ever possibly gain.</i>

01:28:49.481 --> 01:28:51.516
Hello, Miss Angel.

01:28:53.351 --> 01:28:55.220
Do you know who I am?

01:28:55.787 --> 01:28:57.655
Yes, Mr. Hearst.

01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:01.259
Splendid.

01:29:01.292 --> 01:29:04.127
Quite the extraordinary story.

01:29:04.162 --> 01:29:08.466
But then, you're quite
the extraordinary journalist,

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.033
aren't you?

01:29:12.604 --> 01:29:15.072
Can you give me
more of that?

01:29:15.105 --> 01:29:18.343
I can certainly try, sir.

01:29:18.376 --> 01:29:21.613
What this country needs
is more stories like that.

01:29:21.646 --> 01:29:24.516
Stories that our children's
children can recite

01:29:24.549 --> 01:29:27.452
and remember
for years to come.

01:29:27.485 --> 01:29:31.054
Someday, outlaws such as this

01:29:31.088 --> 01:29:33.658
will be remembered as heroes.

01:29:33.691 --> 01:29:38.396
They may even become something
of myth and legend.

01:29:38.429 --> 01:29:41.266
And it will be up
to people like you

01:29:41.299 --> 01:29:46.437
to catalog and chronicle
and express their stories,

01:29:46.471 --> 01:29:49.440
regardless of public opinion.

01:29:49.474 --> 01:29:54.345
For that is true
journalism, my dear.

01:30:01.853 --> 01:30:03.488
<i>The West is wild.</i>

01:30:06.491 --> 01:30:08.359
<i>And her name is Freedom.</i>
