00:03.128 --> 00:05.880
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

00:05.964 --> 00:08.508
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

00:08.592 --> 00:09.801
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

00:09.885 --> 00:12.011
Several billion light years
from home.

00:12.096 --> 00:16.140
We are on a ship, but we
have no idea where we are
in relation to Earth .

00:16.225 --> 00:20.019
RUSH: This ship could be
the most important discovery
mankind has made

00:20.104 --> 00:21.479
since the stargate itself.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.815
YOUNG:
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.733
SCOTT:
l've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.569
RUSH: We barely have
enough power to operate
the main systems.

00:28.654 --> 00:32.240
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth .

00:33.075 --> 00:34.701
Even if we can get
the life support working ,

00:34.785 --> 00:35.868
we don't have
much food and water.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.036
Then go get some.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.996
Little boys
playing soldier.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.665
Well , l'm sorry.
l've no interest
in playing your game.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.708
l'm not playing anything .

00:41.792 --> 00:44.627
l'm trying to save the lives
of everyone aboard that ship.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.549
We do have power issues
to be aware of.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.343
lf l wasn't being clear,
l was giving you an order.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.841
Dr. Rush .

01:32.426 --> 01:33.468
Dr. Rush ,
l was wondering if. . .

01:33.552 --> 01:35.136
Not now!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.150
What are you doing?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.194
Morning . Colonel Young
asked us to figure out. . .

01:51.278 --> 01:54.405
l turned these
systems off for a reason .
They need to stay off!

02:12.257 --> 02:13.257
BRODY: Don't know
whether the ship

02:13.342 --> 02:14.926
has electrolyzed it
to produce oxygen ,

02:15.010 --> 02:17.970
but you can see
there's not much
left in there.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.056
We did some calculations
based on our estimates

02:20.140 --> 02:21.766
of the water depth
and tank dimensions.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.809
And the winner is?

02:22.893 --> 02:24.352
J ust over 90, 000 liters.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.730

02:28.023 --> 02:30.316
Go, Math Boy.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.609
Sounds like a lot.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.444
lt wouldn't fill
a backyard swimming pool .

02:33.529 --> 02:36.656
Still , it's enough to loosen
the rationing restrictions,
isn't it?

02:36.740 --> 02:38.741
Camile, l think l know
where you're going with this,

02:38.826 --> 02:41.619
and believe me
when l say that l , too,
could use a shower.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.995
(ALL CH UCKLl NG)

02:43.080 --> 02:45.623
l don't think
the showers use water.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.627
They just spray
a sort of mist
that you kind of stand in ,

02:49.711 --> 02:51.754
and it sort of
beads up.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.840
There's one in a compartment
off the crew quarters.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.092
How do you know all that
if you haven't tried it?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.261
How do you know
l haven't tried it?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.887
Oh , we know.

Thank you ,
Lieutenant Rose Garden .

03:03.851 --> 03:06.269
No, he's right.
You're worse than he is.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.396
Wow, you can
tell them apart?

03:10.148 --> 03:12.942
We also identified
a recycling system
for liquid waste,

03:13.026 --> 03:15.736
so once we get
that system
up and running . . .

03:18.824 --> 03:22.827
Okay, folks,
let's have a better day
than yesterday. Thank you .

03:30.294 --> 03:31.377

20 minutes ago.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.468
l've been working .

03:40.429 --> 03:42.471
Throughout the night,
actually,

03:42.806 --> 03:45.516
trying to find out why
our power reserves are so low.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.143
l'm quite concerned ,
and so should you be.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.312
Okay, well ,
how bad is it?

03:50.272 --> 03:54.400
l haven't been able to access
any of the main systems yet,
so l don't know.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.485
You look exhausted .
Maybe you should
take a break.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.695
Get the information we need

03:57.779 --> 03:59.697
and make some
informed decisions,

activating every
bloody system they can
get their hands on?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.000
l will .

04:12.002 --> 04:14.337
That was delicious.
Thank you very much .

l'm not really
gonna say that.
J ust try it. Say something .

05:33.542 --> 05:36.669
YOU NG : Well , it could be that
Rush is just starting a fire
so he can put it out,

05:36.753 --> 05:39.755
or it could be that
he's so far ahead of us

05:39.840 --> 05:42.174
he can see problems
that none of us can see.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.552
So what do you
want us to do?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.512
Help him .

not to, considering .

to be careful

not to leave them
on the plate

Turn it off.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.543

we have power issues.

we got here.

to come down , help
translate the controls.

off from important.

underestimating

Can you show me
how to use that shower

Ancient technology,

l've got.

No, no, you see,
you got it backwards.

on the same page.

together on Destiny

may be shorter
than you think.

l get it. Who can l
bring in to help?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.658

longer than we've got

else up to speed .

12:21.658 --> 12:23.450
Hey, heard you
could use a helper.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.452
Well , you
heard wrong .

12:25.537 --> 12:28.080
Yeah , Young said
not to take no
for an answer.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.206
lf he wanted
to be helpful ,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.083
he would have
sent Eli instead .

12:31.167 --> 12:34.211
Well , thank you for that,
but Eli's a kid , really,

12:34.337 --> 12:35.629
and l'm an astrophysicist,
so. . .
Mr. Volker,

12:35.713 --> 12:38.882
l neither need nor want
your help, all right?

12:41.344 --> 12:45.139
Look, he's just going to
drag me right back in here,
and you know it.

12:45.223 --> 12:46.432
Come on .

12:46.516 --> 12:49.935
Right, l'm concerned
that Destiny is on the
verge of losing power.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.395
Look for yourself.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.774
This ship's been flying around
for the better part
of a million years.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.151
l know.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.361
So l don't understand
why all of a sudden . . .

12:59.446 --> 13:03.115
Well , we showed up
and started doing things,
how about that?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.158
Like what?

13:04.242 --> 13:05.576
Dialing back to Earth ,
for one !

13:05.660 --> 13:07.202
Come on , we had to try.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.790
Look out a window, man .
We're flying faster
than the speed of light.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.459
How close to the end
of the rope can we be?

13:13.543 --> 13:16.503
You're obviously
not capable
of seeing the signs.

Okay, well ,
speaking of signs,

13:20.550 --> 13:22.301
when was the last
time you slept?

Look, if you know
what you're looking for,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.555

indications that power
is being channeled

13:26.639 --> 13:27.764

and away from . . .

13:27.849 --> 13:28.932

completely locked out
of the core systems.

work quietly. . .

for that, isn't it?

13:37.567 --> 13:39.485

a waste of time !

A waste of time that
we can ill afford !

staring you in the face,

no good to me !

want to talk.

Don't be an idiot.

Wow, you must be
getting to know me,

really well to that.

a straight answer
from anybody

they would tell you .

did you say to the man?

what his problem was.

knew that. Go.

to hold your hand ,

you think? No.

Maybe it's like

You need the Ancient
gene to access the. . .

19:41.097 --> 19:43.223
Destiny predates
that technology.

Yes, Colonel !

to do things that they know
nothing about, for a fact!

19:57.154 --> 20:00.740

You think all those things
add up to this, Rush?

No, you're right.

pointless attempt
to dial Earth

of my 30th birthday.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.022
l grew up on a farm .

21:15.858 --> 21:17.901
l have relatives
who've never even
left the state,

21:17.985 --> 21:20.987
and here l am halfway
across the universe, so. . .

21:23.199 --> 21:24.574
No regrets.

21:34.752 --> 21:35.877
YOU NG : So. . .

21:36.253 --> 21:39.339
VOLKER: Rush was right.
Everything but
life support is dead .

21:39.423 --> 21:41.299
Well , why now?
Why just when
we show up?

21:41.384 --> 21:43.426
Because we just
showed up.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.303
Well , there's
the stargate.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.847
lt's a power hog ,
and we had it on
all day yesterday.

21:47.932 --> 21:51.142
There's still some power,
and the shields are still
working to some degree.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.644
Again , that's
to keep us alive.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.062
For how long?

21:54.355 --> 21:56.940
We're gonna have to wait
for Rush to wake up
for an answer to that one.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.817
Well , T.J . says he's not
going to be up for a while.

21:58.901 --> 22:01.903
So where does that leave us?

22:03.864 --> 22:05.365
Dead .
Dead .

22:07.201 --> 22:08.159
Not right away.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.828
VOLKER: Yeah , we have days,
maybe a lot of days,

22:09.912 --> 22:11.454
but if there's no
stargate in range. . .

22:11.539 --> 22:12.706
And there's not.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.332
We don't have the power
to dial out anyway.

22:14.417 --> 22:17.627
So it's a race between
food , water and life support.

22:17.712 --> 22:18.670
l don't buy that.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.047
We can't do anything
without access
to the ship's systems.

22:21.132 --> 22:24.092
Look. l mean ,
l could stand here all day.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.052
Eli?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.681
l put a Kino
into search mode

22:29.765 --> 22:31.683
and sent it
into unpressurized
areas of the ship

22:31.767 --> 22:34.519
looking for an active
console somewhere.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.854
Nothing yet.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.481
Also, l was looking
into if there's any way

22:38.566 --> 22:40.358
we could integrate
the shuttle's power

22:40.443 --> 22:42.152
with the ship's system .

22:42.236 --> 22:43.611
So you're working
the problem .

22:43.696 --> 22:44.696
Yeah .

22:50.870 --> 22:52.787
Does the
computer-hacking
dropout

22:52.872 --> 22:53.955
have to save our asses. . .

22:54.040 --> 22:55.373
The dropout
is still here.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.585
. . .or are you going to get
your heads out of yours?

23:00.171 --> 23:02.422
The shuttle idea
is pretty good .

23:02.506 --> 23:04.049
Yeah , there might
be a work-around .

23:04.133 --> 23:05.425
Well , let's do that.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.474
Thank you , Eli .

23:13.684 --> 23:16.936
By the way,
it's MlT dropout.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.064
You want a gold
star for that?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.692
No, l just. . .
Do something .

23:22.777 --> 23:24.944
l'm going to be gone
for a few hours.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.072
Gone?
To report this mess.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.907
lf you need me,
yank me back.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.787
Wanna say hi?

23:33.871 --> 23:35.955
Lieutenant Matthew Scott.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.834
l'm 26 years old ,

23:43.339 --> 23:46.049
and l'd like to say
a prayer for all of us
if that's okay.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.842
ELl : Sure, yeah .
Whatever you want.

23:48.344 --> 23:51.179
The Lord is my shepherd ,
l shall not want.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.601
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.019
He leadeth me
to still waters.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.111
TELFORD: l'll take
it from here, Peter.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.195
Again?

24:08.405 --> 24:10.740
What can l say?
l'm a glutton
for punishment.

24:10.825 --> 24:11.950
Okay.

24:40.604 --> 24:41.896
(G ROANS)

25:03.294 --> 25:04.294
TELFORD: What's
going on , Sergeant?

25:04.378 --> 25:06.171
Actually,
l was coming to ask you .

25:09.425 --> 25:11.634
Colonel Young
went back to report.
l'm Colonel Telford .

25:11.719 --> 25:13.178
l'd like to speak with
Dr. Rush immediately.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.889
Oh? Well , he's had
a nervous breakdown , sir.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.725
What?

25:18.809 --> 25:19.851
But l can take you
to Lieutenant Scott.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.769
He's in the shuttle.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.278
Wow, that was quick.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.574
lt doesn't take
very long to say,
"We're screwed ."

25:34.825 --> 25:37.952
l'm sorry, sir.
l wish there was
something we could do.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.250
There is.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.478
l'll shout down
when she's ready
to see you .

26:23.832 --> 26:26.000
Lieutenant Tamara Johansen .

26:27.002 --> 26:28.670
l'm a paramedic.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.506
l actually quit my job
a few weeks ago.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.634
l shouldn't even be here.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.806
To think l could
have missed all of this.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.623
Hey.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.713
Emily.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.423
No, don't.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.468
l said that you
could come in ,
but that's all .

27:17.553 --> 27:18.720
Okay.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.213
Scott, Johansen .

27:55.924 --> 27:57.550
A word , please.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.600
There's no power
except for the shuttle?

28:06.310 --> 28:07.935
Sir, you already
know that.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.771
Matt, this is
Colonel Telford .

28:10.981 --> 28:12.607
That's right.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.108
Now, would either
of you two officers

28:14.193 --> 28:15.234
care to explain
how Colonel Young

28:15.319 --> 28:17.612
managed to let things
fall apart so fast?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.947
There was no way of knowing
this was going to happen .

28:20.032 --> 28:21.449
You're saying Rush
didn't see it coming?

28:23.452 --> 28:24.786
That's what l thought.

28:25.996 --> 28:28.247
l want to know what's really
going on aboard this ship.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.044
lt's just. . .
lt's ridiculous.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.420
YOU NG : lt's true.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.341
Let's say
that it is. Why?

28:40.677 --> 28:42.387
Why are you
putting me
through this?

28:43.430 --> 28:45.598
Because l wanted to say. . .

28:55.901 --> 28:57.485
(SlG HS)

29:00.072 --> 29:01.114
l'm sorry.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.576
l didn't choose
my job over you .

29:06.662 --> 29:08.704
lt wasn't just
about the job.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.581
l know.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.260
l love you .

29:48.871 --> 29:50.538
l'm guessing
that didn't go well .

29:53.167 --> 29:54.333
Sir.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.800
How does this
change anything?

30:02.885 --> 30:03.926
What do you mean?

30:04.011 --> 30:06.596
Let's say that l
believe all of this.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.973
l don't really,
but even if l did ,

30:09.057 --> 30:11.642
you did choose,
and you chose to go.

30:11.727 --> 30:12.810
l didn't choose this.

30:12.895 --> 30:15.021
You knew there was a chance
you wouldn't be coming back.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.564
l am coming back.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.861
No. You wouldn't be here
like this to say goodbye

30:21.945 --> 30:23.654
if you really thought
there was a chance.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.156
Listen , l'm doing
everything that l can .

30:25.240 --> 30:28.534
l'm going to do
everything that l can .

30:29.995 --> 30:32.121
l want nothing more than
to get back here
to be with you ,

30:32.206 --> 30:33.998
and l want nothing more
than for you to be here

30:34.082 --> 30:36.042
for me when
l do get home.

30:37.085 --> 30:40.254
l'm just saying
l don't know
when that will be.

30:43.425 --> 30:44.759
Please.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.389
You made your choice,
Everett.

30:53.894 --> 30:56.437
And l made mine.
Nothing's changed .

30:58.190 --> 31:02.401
And l really. . .
l really do hope that
you're going to be okay.

31:02.486 --> 31:03.486
Hey. Emily, listen .
Please.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.529
Don't. Don't, please.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.447
Emily, please. Emily.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.449
J ust let me go.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.169
l gave you
a direct order,
Lieutenant.

31:20.254 --> 31:22.338
Sir, l understand that
you gave me a direct order,

31:22.422 --> 31:25.424
and l respectfully
suggest it would be
a complete waste of time !

31:25.509 --> 31:28.803
l'm telling you ,
the ship came here
for a reason !

31:30.556 --> 31:31.556
SCOTT: Sir?

31:31.640 --> 31:32.890
The ship came here
for what reason?

31:34.184 --> 31:36.060
Colonel Young?
Yeah , yeah .

31:36.144 --> 31:38.271
What the hell was Telford
just ordering you to do?

31:38.355 --> 31:41.774
Use the communication stones
to report that you
need to be replaced .

31:42.025 --> 31:44.193
Well , he's probably
right about that.

31:44.278 --> 31:47.446
So, the ship came here
for what reason?

31:54.746 --> 31:56.455
The odds of coming
out of FTL

31:56.540 --> 32:00.084
on the outer edge
of a star system
are astronomical .

32:00.669 --> 32:05.214
Throw in the fact that
there are three potentially
habitable planets,

32:05.299 --> 32:09.594
plus a gas giant
to act as a comet catcher
on the outside of the system?

32:09.678 --> 32:11.095
We're talking miraculous.

32:11.179 --> 32:15.725
So there's a chance now
that we're going to live. . .

32:16.268 --> 32:19.437
Though our
definition
of "habitable"

32:19.521 --> 32:24.609
just means the surface
temperature range allows for
the presence of liquid water,

32:24.693 --> 32:28.029
and since the primary's
a red dwarf,

32:28.113 --> 32:31.490
the planets must have
a relatively
short orbital radius

32:31.575 --> 32:32.867
just to fall
within that range,

32:32.951 --> 32:36.370
which means there's
a likelihood at least
one or two of them

32:36.455 --> 32:37.580
will be tidally locked ,

32:37.664 --> 32:40.416
meaning one side
will always be
facing the star,

32:40.500 --> 32:45.296
which increases the prospect
of geological instability
due to tidal stresses,

32:45.380 --> 32:46.881
and l can't
stand earthquakes.

32:46.965 --> 32:52.428
l was in one when l was 1 3,
and l cut both
my feet on broken glass.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.477
But it might be nice !

33:10.572 --> 33:12.239
Hey. How are you?

33:15.994 --> 33:17.995
How did l get here?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.288
You're not that heavy.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.250
You passed out
for a little while.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.211
How long?

33:25.295 --> 33:26.420
About 1 0 hours.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.216
lt's probably the first
real sleep you've had
since we arrived here.

33:32.094 --> 33:33.302
Has anything happened?

33:33.387 --> 33:36.639
Not since we lost power, no.
You haven't missed a thing .

33:37.349 --> 33:38.933
How do you feel?

33:39.559 --> 33:41.102
Embarrassed .

33:41.186 --> 33:42.311
Don't be.

33:42.396 --> 33:43.604
Well , you weren't there.

33:45.107 --> 33:47.108
Your head's
pounding , right?

33:47.609 --> 33:49.527
How many cups of coffee
do you normally drink a day?

33:49.611 --> 33:51.112
Four? Five?

33:52.197 --> 33:53.322
You're in caffeine
withdrawal .

33:53.407 --> 33:55.950
So are about a dozen
other people on board .

33:56.034 --> 33:57.910
lt can make you
pretty crazy.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.787
You should see
the smokers.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.790
You're looking at one.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.126
Double whammy, huh?

34:05.877 --> 34:06.877
l was going to let
you sleep it off,

34:06.962 --> 34:09.714
but the Colonel wants
you to see something ,
so let's go.

34:13.592 --> 34:17.096
ELl : lf you don't do one,
they're not going to know
who the hell you are.

34:17.179 --> 34:19.348
Eli , l have nothing to say.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.599
ELl : People are
going to find this.

34:20.684 --> 34:23.393
They're going to want
to know who we were.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.730
Look, l'll do
your slate, okay?

34:25.813 --> 34:27.313
This is Dr. N icholas Rush .

34:27.399 --> 34:30.400
He is the lead scientist
of the lcarus Project.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.695
Now just say
what you feel .

34:58.930 --> 35:00.347
Come on in .

35:01.933 --> 35:03.517
Orbital insertion trajectory?

35:04.352 --> 35:05.978
That was my
first thought.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.440
l thought your first thought
was we were gonna
fly into the damn thing .

35:09.524 --> 35:13.194
But, no, sir.
l'm guessing we'll get
close enough to kiss,

35:13.278 --> 35:14.904
but not enough
for capture.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.280
An aerobraking
maneuver?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.616
Well , the math's
over my head , but, yeah ,

35:18.700 --> 35:21.368
we should come out
of a slingshot
somewhere in-system .

35:21.661 --> 35:24.038
Where there are
habitable planets.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.416
l didn't tell him .

35:27.501 --> 35:29.043
No, but you're
all smiling .

35:29.544 --> 35:32.129
Well , we're still too far
out to know if they're
anything more than rocks,

35:32.214 --> 35:35.716
but we found three candidates
before Big Bertha
here filled up the sky.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.302
So this trajectory
is no accident, then .

35:38.386 --> 35:40.805
The man's quick.
We'll know once we're clear.

35:40.889 --> 35:43.265
That'll be
in six minutes.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.226
Who translated this?

35:46.394 --> 35:48.896
You know
it's completely
backwards.

35:51.858 --> 35:55.820
Well , pull up a chair, sir.
This'll be a show
you don't want to miss.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.489
YOU NG : So we're clear,
my definition of habitable

35:58.573 --> 36:01.158
includes a sandy beach ,
a tropical climate. . .

36:01.243 --> 36:02.451
RUSH : There's going to be
some severe turbulence

36:02.536 --> 36:04.119
when we contact
the atmosphere.

36:06.623 --> 36:07.832
l'll pass the word .

36:07.916 --> 36:09.583
Colonel , about our
previous conversation . . .

36:10.377 --> 36:11.669
Rush , no need
to apologize.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.337
l wasn't about to.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.006
l'm trying to explain
l was suffering from
withdrawal symptoms. . .

36:16.091 --> 36:18.425
Yeah , yeah , l know.
l know all about it.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.264
Lot of, lot of work.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.894
Hello, there.
Adam Brody is my name.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.106
Can l start again?

36:34.025 --> 36:36.777
My name's Adam Brody,
as l said earlier.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.113
Hello. . .
ELl : Cut.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.950
Adam Brody, engineer.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.703
l like football ,
and l . . . What?

36:45.787 --> 36:47.913
(CH UCKLl NG) Dude,
this isn't for
a dating service.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.582
Yeah , l just. . .
l don't know why
that came out.

36:49.666 --> 36:50.666
l'm just. . .
l don't know why
l'm so nervous.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.543
ELl : No, no,
it's all good .
lt's all good .

36:52.627 --> 36:56.130
What do we got?
We have your name,
we have your job.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.965
What else is there?

36:58.425 --> 36:59.717
Oh , you're
40-something ,
so. . .

36:59.801 --> 37:01.010
Thirty-six.

37:02.679 --> 37:06.390
ELl : Okay. We got that now.
We'll fix that in editing .

37:07.225 --> 37:10.728
All that's left is what
you want to say for posterity.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.025
l always knew l was
going to die in space.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.321
From the moment l stepped
through the stargate, l . . .

37:22.782 --> 37:23.908
l mean , l didn't expect this,

37:23.992 --> 37:28.120
but l knew something awful
was going to happen .

37:31.499 --> 37:33.000
l just knew it.

37:36.963 --> 37:37.963
This is Young .

37:38.048 --> 37:41.008
We are expecting some
atmospheric turbulence
in a few minutes.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.844
Find a secure place
and plunk your asses down .

37:46.848 --> 37:48.182
RI LEY ON KI NO: Whoa!
Don't shoot. It's me!

37:48.266 --> 37:49.391
G REER: You can talk
through that thing?

37:49.476 --> 37:52.061
Rl LEY: Hey, l can talk
through this thing!

37:56.274 --> 37:57.399
Riley asked me
how to use. . .

37:57.484 --> 37:58.567
l asked him how
the Kino works.

37:58.652 --> 38:02.196
Yeah , yeah .
We took a wrong turn .

38:03.198 --> 38:05.199
l can and will
kick your ass.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.325
YOU NG : Let's
do that later.

38:06.409 --> 38:09.453
We're going to pass
very close to a gas giant
in a few minutes.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.996
