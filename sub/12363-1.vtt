I'm not happy about this,

How long have you,

And the other convicts
been planning this?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.054
It wasn't no plan.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.223
I was planning on
being in another prison,

14:52.225 --> 14:53.825
And that psycho
busted us out.

So, you and your
fellow murderers

14:59.499 --> 15:01.733
Well, I ain't feeling real lucky
right now.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.935
And I ain't no murderer.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.937
I just dealt some drugs
is all.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.273
You have 35 years
for dealing coke.

It's at 11,000 feet,

Which means it's gonna get
a lot colder up there,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.616
And the weather's gonna get
a lot worse.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.552
Why exactly did you let walt
head into that weather alone?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.721
I didn't.
He made me.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.081
Walt's up on that mountain.

Hard to believe, I know, but
he doesn't have a cellphone.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.918

I gave him mine.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.453

No.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.293

We have agents at the ready,

18:15.295 --> 18:16.961
But these are
whiteout-blizzard conditions.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.296
The best we can manage
at the moment

18:18.298 --> 18:19.530
Is to contain wayne
and his allies.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.632
When the storm lets up,

18:21.634 --> 18:24.869
We will initiate a full-scale
search-and-rescue operation.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.404
Now, in the meantime,

18:26.406 --> 18:29.073
Any request for activities
will go through me.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.209
Understood.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.144
So your policy is to let them
all freeze to death?

18:33.146 --> 18:35.113
Including walt?

18:36.715 --> 18:40.151
Our policy is caution
and common sense.

an arsenal and a vehicle.

what he's doing,

19:01.941 --> 19:03.908
Of walking
into the teeth of this storm

19:03.910 --> 19:06.177
And he will turn back
or he will take shelter.

anything,

out what walt is walking into?

that this was a setup.

And sold their body parts,
which means money,

paid for his freedom.

24:07.145 --> 24:11.882
We met a year ago
at the prison.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.218
I brought in dogs
for therapy

24:14.220 --> 24:17.421
To help rehabilitate
the prison population,

24:17.423 --> 24:19.957

with the animals.

24:22.727 --> 24:26.597
Wayne told me that he would be
transported through here,

24:26.599 --> 24:29.767
And this was our chance
to be together,

24:29.769 --> 24:33.771
The way we were meant
to be.

24:33.773 --> 24:37.975

four months ago

24:37.977 --> 24:40.277

24:40.279 --> 24:42.313
He doesn't love you, helen.

24:42.315 --> 24:45.583

is himself,

24:45.585 --> 24:47.818
Or he wouldn't have
left you behind.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.125
That psychiatrist
turned him against me.

24:55.127 --> 25:00.164
But he'll get rid of her
and come back for me.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.167
He'll miss my dogs
too much.

is gonna run out of gas

You'll go after him,
and he'll kill you.

That's not going to stop me
any more than you lying to me

26:45.605 --> 26:47.972
About that tweaker
in denver.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.945
I didn't lie.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.848
Keep telling yourself that.

27:04.756 --> 27:07.124
I want to be on the first
helicopter out of here.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.961
Do you hear me?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.463
I did.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.098
So, when do we take off?

27:14.100 --> 27:16.066
Our nearest chopper
is in montana

27:16.068 --> 27:19.136
Being slammed by the storm
that just passed through here.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.405
We don't have clearance
to send it up.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.608
What is that?

27:24.610 --> 27:25.909
It's a map.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.679
The marks --
what are the marks?

27:30.949 --> 27:33.083
Where is sheriff connally?

27:33.085 --> 27:36.286
He's a deputy, and I have
no idea where branch is.

27:36.288 --> 27:39.156
He went awol,
but it means I'm in charge,

27:39.158 --> 27:40.491
So what is going on?

27:40.493 --> 27:43.293
[ chuckles lightly ]

27:43.295 --> 27:46.363
Deputy...

27:46.365 --> 27:48.599
Our agent,
who is still in the field,

27:48.601 --> 27:50.467
Has a tracking device
hidden inside her jacket,

27:50.469 --> 27:52.102
Which we've been
monitoring.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.104
You had a tracking device
up there and you didn't tell me?

27:54.106 --> 27:55.372
What the hell --

27:55.374 --> 27:57.374
The gps is spotty
given the storm,

27:57.376 --> 27:59.443
And we don't want any of you
going up there half-cocked

27:59.445 --> 28:02.012
And getting yourselves
or the hostages killed.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.647
We are doing all we can
at this moment.

28:03.649 --> 28:07.618
So, I give you a complete
debrief on everything I got,

28:07.620 --> 28:09.553
And you don't even tell me
you know where walt is?

28:09.555 --> 28:10.688
We can't get there.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.189
You can't or you won't?

28:12.191 --> 28:13.857
Because I just got
a weather report that says

28:13.859 --> 28:16.060
It is totally clear
at the top of that mountain.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.828
So what?

28:17.830 --> 28:19.863
These are trees and power lines
blocking every road up.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.032
The cloud ceiling
is at 7,000 feet.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.734
Helicopters are grounded.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.704
And even if we could fly,
your sheriff and my agent

28:26.706 --> 28:29.573
Are at an altitude that would
make it too damn dangerous.

28:29.575 --> 28:35.479
So until we come up with a plan
that has a chance of success,

28:35.481 --> 28:38.916
I got to ask you to do
the hardest thing of all...

28:38.918 --> 28:41.552
Be patient!

28:50.762 --> 28:53.530
[ dog barks in distance ]

28:53.532 --> 28:55.833
Shit.

29:00.605 --> 29:04.274
You and walt have been friends
a long time.

29:04.276 --> 29:07.344
Has he always had a death wish
or is he just trying to prove

29:07.346 --> 29:10.047
He's still young and tough
enough to get the bad guys?

29:10.049 --> 29:12.116
Maybe he is not trying
to prove anything.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.518
Maybe walt
just thinks of his job

29:14.520 --> 29:16.386
As a duty rather than a game.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.288
Maybe.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.793
[ wind howling ]

What are you doing
out here?

31:01.794 --> 31:04.194
[ sniffles ]
I got kicked out.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.164
What?

31:07.166 --> 31:08.665
They can't do that.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.201
I hit towson.
[ laughs ]

31:11.203 --> 31:12.636
And he made it very clear

31:12.638 --> 31:14.504
That if I didn't leave,
he would press charges.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.506
That is awesome.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.141
No, it sucks.

31:18.143 --> 31:21.879
I am mad at letting walt go
by himself.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.348
I am pissed at branch
for disappearing.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.984
And there is not a thing
I can do about it.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.027
Now.
What did I do? I --

31:37.029 --> 31:38.228
Just get out of here, ferg.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.468

Where did you go, punk?

34:12.818 --> 34:15.886
Where you been?

34:15.888 --> 34:17.821
I haven't heard from you
in weeks.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.688
I called your office.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.359
They said you quit.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.728
Doesn't matter.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.897
I'm here now.

There was nothing
you could do,

But I knew someone
was coming to help me.

Did he leave?

He brought us all the way
up here for this.
