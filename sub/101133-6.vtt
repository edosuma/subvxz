00:07.727 --> 00:09.697
<i>- From the visionary
who brought you</i>

00:09.721 --> 00:13.273
<i>OrgasMonday 39 and the Moistboys</i>

00:13.350 --> 00:17.194
<i>comes a feely unlike anything
we've ever seen.</i>

00:34.287 --> 00:35.473
- Gripping.
As if I was there.

00:35.497 --> 00:38.131
- - Marco...
- Mm-hmm?

00:38.208 --> 00:39.633
- You've done it again.

00:39.709 --> 00:40.509
- Haven't I?

00:40.585 --> 00:43.095
- You have.
You so have.

00:43.171 --> 00:44.554
- And that's just the trailer.

00:44.631 --> 00:46.973
Just wait
till you see the full...

00:47.050 --> 00:50.778
Oh, look.
It's already catching on.

00:52.114 --> 00:54.481
Thank you, Counselor.

00:54.558 --> 00:57.067
He absolutely makes the evening.

00:57.144 --> 01:01.246
- Ah, well, you
know... pleasure.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.240
- Dilletante.

01:03.316 --> 01:04.761
- Oh, come on.
He's not that bad.

01:04.785 --> 01:06.451
- His haptics
are completely filched.

01:06.528 --> 01:07.953
From me.

01:08.029 --> 01:11.090
It's my own fault, really,
for trying to raise the bar.

01:11.592 --> 01:14.321
- I better check on John.
- Ah, yes, man of the hour.

01:14.345 --> 01:17.199
- John's not used
to this level of attention.

01:17.223 --> 01:18.680
- Who said anything about John?

01:20.643 --> 01:22.425
Careful, Bernard.

01:22.502 --> 01:24.182
You keep parading him
around these parties,

01:24.212 --> 01:25.771
soon everyone's gonna want one.

01:30.361 --> 01:34.563
- And in the winter,
we would scavenge for food.

01:34.639 --> 01:38.826
We ate bug paste
and called it meat.

01:40.103 --> 01:42.320
What else? Um...

01:42.397 --> 01:44.948
- Tell us
of your Savage violence.

01:45.025 --> 01:48.243
- Yes. Do it slowly.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.996
- Um...

01:51.072 --> 01:52.884
when I was a kid, I saw a guy

01:52.908 --> 01:54.833
get beat up for his coat.

01:58.538 --> 02:01.243
And strangled with it.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.968
Yeah.

02:05.045 --> 02:08.138
Where I come from,
there's only two levels:

02:08.215 --> 02:11.191
the living and the dead.

02:13.970 --> 02:15.290
- Hi.
- Bernard.

02:15.314 --> 02:16.771
Can I talk to you for a second?

02:16.848 --> 02:18.448
- Sorry. One sec.

02:20.727 --> 02:22.277
- Where the fuck have you been?

02:22.354 --> 02:23.445
- Oh, you're agitated.

02:23.521 --> 02:24.321
- I don't know
what I'm supposed to say

02:24.397 --> 02:25.575
to these people.

02:25.599 --> 02:27.144
- They just want
to get to know you, John.

02:27.168 --> 02:28.377
- No, they don't.

02:28.401 --> 02:30.796
They want me to be
some sort of killer.

02:30.820 --> 02:32.149
They want me to be the guy
who threw the punch,

02:32.173 --> 02:33.663
but I didn't throw the punch.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.123
- Didn't you?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.083
- No. You did.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.503
- Huh. Well, seems most people
remember it differently now.

02:40.580 --> 02:43.034
Anyway,
they're just curious, John.

02:43.058 --> 02:44.633
- Fucking shit.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.509
- They only know
what they've been told.

02:46.586 --> 02:48.039
The truth, your life, what
you've actually been through,

02:48.063 --> 02:50.013
they couldn't possibly imagine.

02:50.090 --> 02:51.256
Help them.

02:55.095 --> 02:58.238
You can be whoever
you want to be.

03:02.477 --> 03:04.556
- Tell us
about your woman birth.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.780
- Okay, again,
don't remember that.

03:06.856 --> 03:09.416
- I want to feed you things
with my feet.

03:11.611 --> 03:13.815
- Uh, maybe John
just needs a moment.

03:13.839 --> 03:15.839
John...
- You remind me of someone.

03:17.534 --> 03:20.197
- Does she, John?
Who does she remind you of?

03:22.973 --> 03:25.590
- The first time I saw her,

03:25.667 --> 03:28.455
she was standing alone
in a field.

03:30.005 --> 03:35.183
And I thought...

03:35.260 --> 03:37.047
- Go on.

03:40.241 --> 03:44.317
- I thought,
"I'm looking at the last

03:44.394 --> 03:47.849
unbroken thing
in all the world."

03:48.940 --> 03:51.199
- Who was she?

03:51.276 --> 03:53.535
- A Savage, like me.

03:57.082 --> 03:58.276
And I loved her.

04:01.661 --> 04:05.742
But her parents had promised
her to another man.

04:05.766 --> 04:10.260
He wasn't a good man,
but he had power.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.623
He swore he'd slaughter me

04:11.647 --> 04:14.723
if ever I laid eyes
on his bride.

04:14.799 --> 04:17.809
I tried to stay away,
but I couldn't.

04:17.886 --> 04:20.507
I'd rather die
than be without her.

04:20.531 --> 04:21.532
- What happened to your eye?

04:21.556 --> 04:22.981
- You like my Foster?

04:23.058 --> 04:24.482
- Your what?

04:24.559 --> 04:27.411
- My Henry Foster.
It's the latest.

04:27.487 --> 04:29.913
You know, from your punch.

04:32.793 --> 04:34.960
- You know,
you remind me of someone.

04:36.696 --> 04:38.766
So there was nothing to do
but fight him.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.468
I mean,
he was bigger and stronger,

04:40.492 --> 04:43.043
but he didn't love her
like I did.

04:43.119 --> 04:45.345
You two remind me of someone.

04:46.598 --> 04:47.964
The town gathered.

04:48.041 --> 04:49.466
It was me against him

04:49.542 --> 04:53.136
and his inbred brothers,
four to one.

04:53.213 --> 04:54.471
Seven to one.

04:54.547 --> 04:55.638
Plus his dog.

04:55.715 --> 04:58.169
His entire gang
of nightmare men.

04:58.193 --> 04:59.820
He fought dirty.
So did I.

04:59.844 --> 05:03.146
Because that is what love
will make you do.

05:03.223 --> 05:04.375
I was laying in the dirt,

05:04.399 --> 05:05.899
taste of blood in my mouth.

05:05.975 --> 05:08.401
I looked up.

05:08.478 --> 05:11.182
There she was,
golden hair shimmering,

05:11.206 --> 05:12.489
messy like a storm,

05:12.565 --> 05:14.324
nails the color of midnight,

05:14.401 --> 05:16.159
eyes like the barrel of a gun.

05:16.236 --> 05:19.941
Her voice, her touch, her kiss,
her lips gave me strength.

05:19.965 --> 05:21.456
- And you won?

05:21.533 --> 05:23.416
- Wouldn't that have been nice?

05:24.744 --> 05:26.169
Never really healed.

05:26.246 --> 05:28.463
Neither did my heart.

05:28.540 --> 05:32.078
And the truth is that...

05:32.102 --> 05:34.344
- He never saw her again.

05:37.215 --> 05:41.184
- I never saw her... again.

05:41.261 --> 05:42.589
I died that night.

05:42.613 --> 05:49.743
I'm waiting, waiting...
to be revived.

06:41.237 --> 06:43.547
<i>- Never really healed.</i>

06:43.623 --> 06:45.665
<i>Neither did my heart.</i>

06:45.742 --> 06:51.296
<i>The truth is... I
never saw her again.</i>

06:51.372 --> 06:52.889
<i>I died that night.</i>

06:54.551 --> 06:58.178
I've been waiting
to be revived ever since.

07:00.765 --> 07:04.893
And in the winter, we would...

07:04.969 --> 07:07.812
we would scavenge for food.

07:07.889 --> 07:09.814
Hey.

07:09.891 --> 07:11.533
You remind me of someone.

07:13.978 --> 07:16.488
- Who, John?
Who does she remind you of?

07:16.564 --> 07:17.581
- Sorry.

07:59.649 --> 08:01.369
- For the wait.
- Mm.

08:05.631 --> 08:06.713
- Pleasure Gardens?

08:08.458 --> 08:10.302
Hey, all right, just let me
know where you want to go,

08:10.326 --> 08:11.459
and we'll go.

08:11.536 --> 08:12.972
- Home.
- No, don't... come on.

08:12.996 --> 08:14.265
It's early.
In fact, I had the...

08:14.289 --> 08:16.681
- Bernard, I'm tired.

08:18.918 --> 08:21.261
- So you had an off night.

08:21.337 --> 08:22.606
- What?
- It's okay.

08:22.630 --> 08:23.816
There's always tomorrow.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.016
In fact, I didn't
tell you this because...

08:27.093 --> 08:29.852
the Director of Stability
has invited us to attend...

08:29.929 --> 08:32.572
- The Direct... that Henry guy?

08:34.234 --> 08:35.275
I thought you hated him.

08:36.736 --> 08:38.564
Henry Foster's
a very important person,

08:38.588 --> 08:40.583
and his formal induction
ceremony is tomorrow morning.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.527
- Exciting.
- Yeah, and they...

08:43.943 --> 08:45.493
You're being insincere again.

08:45.570 --> 08:48.672
- Sorry, forget it.
Look, you go.

08:48.748 --> 08:50.092
He's your boss.
You should go.

08:50.116 --> 08:51.883
- Well, he invited both of us.

08:53.453 --> 08:56.179
So we wouldn't want him
to be disappointed.

08:56.256 --> 08:58.306
- Right.
Or we could not give a shit.

09:09.695 --> 09:12.437
<i>- Now leaving
District of the Body.</i>

09:12.513 --> 09:13.907
Stop.

09:13.931 --> 09:15.701
Would you just knock it off?
- Sorry, just, John,

09:15.725 --> 09:17.971
your levels, they're
clearly... - Stop.

09:17.995 --> 09:20.320
I'm not.
I'm just...

09:20.396 --> 09:22.614
I'm sick of telling
the fucking story.

09:22.690 --> 09:25.645
- Oh.
Oh, forgive me.

09:25.669 --> 09:27.749
I thought you were enjoying
the parties.

09:27.787 --> 09:30.213
The attention.
The affection.

09:30.290 --> 09:32.215
I mean, hey, no,
if it's a burden, then...

09:32.292 --> 09:33.644
- Look,
I didn't say it's not fun.

09:33.668 --> 09:37.086
I just... I don't see why
I always have to...

09:37.163 --> 09:39.589
Why can't I just go
and be like everyone else?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.007
- Of course you can, John.

09:41.084 --> 09:42.767
That's...

09:45.755 --> 09:47.939
It lasted longer
than I expected, actually.

09:48.883 --> 09:50.299
- What are you talking about?

09:50.377 --> 09:52.196
- Well, everyone's conditioned
to want the new thing,

09:52.220 --> 09:53.686
the next thing.

09:53.763 --> 09:55.024
It's like these trends,
you know?

09:55.048 --> 09:58.983
They, well, they...
They come and they go.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.829
What's fashionable
in the morning

10:00.853 --> 10:02.945
is normally over
when the sun goes down.

10:03.022 --> 10:04.656
It's the same for celebrity.

10:04.732 --> 10:06.916
No one usually
lasts more than a day.

10:07.485 --> 10:09.463
Bullshit, man, I've been
telling the story for, like...

10:09.487 --> 10:10.962
- Six days.

10:12.532 --> 10:13.532
- Six?

10:14.742 --> 10:16.668
- Yeah.
- And that's...

10:16.744 --> 10:18.878
- Well, unprecedented, actually.

10:18.955 --> 10:20.216
No, but everything has its time,

10:20.240 --> 10:21.517
and if you don't like it, John,
then I don't care

10:21.541 --> 10:22.965
if Henry Foster himself gets...

10:23.042 --> 10:24.561
- Hold on.
- No, John, listen.

10:24.585 --> 10:26.748
Everyone's happy here.
Really.

10:26.772 --> 10:28.232
And that does include you.
- Maybe I...

10:28.256 --> 10:31.900
Maybe I can switch it up
or something.

10:31.976 --> 10:36.321
- Oh. Hmm.
That's interesting.

10:39.693 --> 10:41.117
- Was Lenina there tonight?

10:44.063 --> 10:46.030
- Len... Lenina Crowne?

10:46.107 --> 10:47.123
No.

10:48.776 --> 10:50.936
- Oh. Thought I saw her.
Whatever. Forget it.

10:52.822 --> 10:54.163
- Mm, here we are.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.250
<i>- Now arriving.
District of the Sublime.</i>

10:57.326 --> 10:59.030
- I think I'm gonna
keep going a bit.

10:59.054 --> 11:01.671
- Go? Where, exactly?

11:01.748 --> 11:05.174
- I don't know.
Just wherever it takes me.

11:05.251 --> 11:07.352
I don't know.
End of the line.

11:09.589 --> 11:12.857
- Okay, well... whatever
you want, John.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.903
I'll see you in the morning,
right?

13:13.629 --> 13:15.805
- I've missed you.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.900
Has it been a long time?

13:20.303 --> 13:22.645
- Yes.

13:22.722 --> 13:24.021
- Well...

13:24.098 --> 13:27.692
I'm sure you meant
to visit sooner.

13:27.768 --> 13:28.805
- Where are the others?

13:28.829 --> 13:30.945
- They're off somewhere,

13:31.022 --> 13:33.155
being insufferable.

13:33.232 --> 13:35.592
I don't know why I thought
it would be different here.

13:36.235 --> 13:39.462
Vacations always bring out
the worst in people.

13:40.364 --> 13:43.591
And all I've got to show for it
is this spectacular tan.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.460
- You were always so vain.

13:46.537 --> 13:48.588
- I'm not the one
lying about my age.

13:48.664 --> 13:49.922
- You cloned yourself.

13:49.999 --> 13:51.307
- What can I say?

13:51.918 --> 13:54.143
Takes many hands
to build a city.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.942
What's it like up
there, seeing my face?

14:02.153 --> 14:04.988
- Took some getting used to.

14:06.432 --> 14:07.690
- You love it.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.325
Admit it.

14:15.575 --> 14:18.084
Are you waiting for me
to ask you what's wrong?

14:20.279 --> 14:23.205
You only come down here
when Indra misbehaves.

14:23.282 --> 14:25.383
What's it done this time?

14:26.386 --> 14:28.419
Tell me.

14:28.496 --> 14:30.138
Please.

14:30.214 --> 14:32.265
I'm so fucking bored.

14:34.293 --> 14:35.894
- There's a new virus.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.272
- What's it look like?

14:40.600 --> 14:41.891
- A man.

14:45.805 --> 14:48.648
<i>- Now arriving.
District of the Body.</i>

14:50.610 --> 14:53.536
- That's the Savage.
Don't stare.

14:59.819 --> 15:01.044
- Oh. Lenina.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.280
- What are you doing here?

15:02.321 --> 15:03.749
- I'm trying to get out of here.

15:03.773 --> 15:05.801
You know this fucking thing
goes in a circle?

15:07.702 --> 15:09.093
Everyone knows that.

15:10.079 --> 15:11.607
Oh.

15:11.631 --> 15:14.474
Well, at least
I bumped into you.

15:16.636 --> 15:19.040
- You know, they...
They don't really happen here.

15:19.064 --> 15:20.563
- What?

15:20.640 --> 15:23.149
- Collisions.

15:27.322 --> 15:29.642
- You were there tonight,
weren't you, at the party?

15:31.308 --> 15:32.608
What, you didn't want to see me?

15:32.685 --> 15:35.453
- Well, you were with
all those people.

15:36.030 --> 15:37.822
- I don't care
about those people.

15:37.898 --> 15:39.292
You shouldn't have
run off like that.

15:39.316 --> 15:40.783
- I couldn't stay.

15:40.860 --> 15:42.418
- Why not?

15:44.739 --> 15:46.789
Lenina, why not?

15:46.866 --> 15:48.666
- I'm glad you're happy, John.

15:48.743 --> 15:52.294
- Well, you know,
Bernard's just helping me get...

15:52.371 --> 15:54.046
I'm just trying
to find my place here.

15:54.123 --> 15:56.966
- Mm, you found lots of places.

15:57.043 --> 16:00.302
Alphas, Bets, Pluses, Minuses.

16:00.379 --> 16:02.313
It's on everyone's feeds.

16:03.007 --> 16:04.887
- You been watching me?
- No.

16:05.634 --> 16:08.394
But I hear.
It's all anyone can talk about.

16:08.471 --> 16:09.865
- Wait, are you, like,
mad at me?

16:09.889 --> 16:11.033
Come on.
- No. What?

16:11.057 --> 16:13.482
Why would I be?

16:13.559 --> 16:16.569
You're doing what
you're supposed to do, John.

16:16.645 --> 16:17.925
Like everyone else.

16:18.397 --> 16:20.865
- Look, the people I was with,
they didn't...

16:20.941 --> 16:23.086
- Mean anything?
Yeah, exactly.

16:23.110 --> 16:24.880
See?
You're an Alpha already.

16:24.904 --> 16:26.829
- Why'd you leave the party?

16:26.906 --> 16:28.256
- I told you.

16:29.784 --> 16:31.064
- No, you didn't.

16:33.329 --> 16:34.512
- It made me sad. I...

16:36.916 --> 16:38.152
Couldn't stay anymore.

16:38.176 --> 16:40.143
Bernard said
you wouldn't mind if I left.

16:40.219 --> 16:41.886
- Wait, he said what?

16:41.962 --> 16:44.355
- I just... I don't fit.

16:45.883 --> 16:47.483
I try to, but I just can't...

16:49.428 --> 16:51.112
Seem to get back to myself.

16:53.599 --> 16:57.660
I went there tonight
because I thought if I saw you,

16:57.737 --> 17:00.112
I'd remember who it is
I'm supposed to be,

17:00.189 --> 17:01.664
but it...

17:01.741 --> 17:03.661
Oh, forget it.
It doesn't matter.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.592
- Do you feel that?

17:21.669 --> 17:23.561
The vibration?

17:27.692 --> 17:29.767
- It's just a train.

17:45.859 --> 17:47.451
- Where does it go?

17:47.528 --> 17:50.121
- It's the Epsilon train.

17:50.197 --> 17:51.839
It goes Epsilon places.

17:53.868 --> 17:54.959
- So you don't know.

17:55.035 --> 17:56.135
- No one knows.

17:57.955 --> 18:00.058
Will you stop?
The system won't allow you to...

18:00.082 --> 18:01.307
- You coming or not?

18:05.379 --> 18:07.619
- The system knows, John.
Indra sees everything.

18:07.673 --> 18:09.807
- Not this guy.
No optic.

18:09.884 --> 18:12.485
I'm invisible.

18:12.562 --> 18:15.146
- We can't get on that train.

18:15.222 --> 18:16.605
Surely you've noticed that

18:16.682 --> 18:18.201
everyone travels
in their designated...

18:18.225 --> 18:19.905
- Says who?
- Say...

18:20.319 --> 18:21.599
Well, it's a fact.

18:25.116 --> 18:26.666
- It's your conditioning.

18:41.090 --> 18:43.244
- You coming or not?

18:59.784 --> 19:02.326
- Wow.

19:05.156 --> 19:06.664
- Remain seated, John.

19:07.650 --> 19:09.330
- I'm okay.
Thanks.

19:11.445 --> 19:12.795
- They know you?

19:15.449 --> 19:18.667
- Sure, you know, I guess.

19:18.744 --> 19:19.793
Wow.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.540
You've really
never been out here?

19:24.884 --> 19:26.508
What's wrong?

19:26.585 --> 19:28.225
- Nothing.
It's...

19:29.338 --> 19:30.541
The conditioners separate

19:30.565 --> 19:32.556
the Beta infants
from the Alphas.

19:32.633 --> 19:36.797
Then they administer
a correction,

19:36.821 --> 19:38.270
increasing the intensity

19:38.347 --> 19:40.031
as they move the Betas
further away.

19:40.107 --> 19:41.240
It's just my...

19:42.643 --> 19:44.744
It'll pass.

19:44.820 --> 19:45.820
- Here.

19:50.335 --> 19:53.586
I used to do this for my mom
when she'd...

19:54.488 --> 19:55.963
She'd get sick sometimes.

19:58.575 --> 20:00.125
Does that help?

20:05.291 --> 20:06.641
- You miss her...

20:09.086 --> 20:10.645
Even though she's dead.

20:13.007 --> 20:14.515
Was that...

20:14.591 --> 20:17.401
I said the wrong thing.
- It's okay.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.109
- Not for this.

20:36.530 --> 20:39.498
You could have fed everybody.

20:52.179 --> 20:55.668
<i>- It's your hundredth year.</i>

20:55.692 --> 21:00.005
<i>You want it to be special.</i>

21:00.029 --> 21:03.406
<i>That's why I'm here,</i>

21:03.482 --> 21:07.067
<i>because you deserve me.</i>

21:09.313 --> 21:12.768
<i>I know where you want to go.</i>

21:12.792 --> 21:16.919
<i>I know how to get you there.</i>

21:19.156 --> 21:22.842
<i>To that place
where they'll never find us.</i>

21:25.579 --> 21:31.475
<i>Soma Red, because
it's your time.</i>

21:34.421 --> 21:35.701
- What's taking so long?

21:35.756 --> 21:37.067
It's the director's
inauguration.

21:37.091 --> 21:38.091
- Tea?

21:39.426 --> 21:41.060
- No, just...

21:41.136 --> 21:43.114
why don't you just go
and get him washed and dressed?

21:43.138 --> 21:46.732
We want formality
with a little flash.

21:46.809 --> 21:48.152
What's trending today?

21:48.176 --> 21:51.320
- Aubergine.
- Oh, Gary, make it so.

21:53.982 --> 21:55.074
Soma tea?

21:55.150 --> 21:57.501
- No, just bring me John.

21:59.538 --> 22:01.547
- Your happiness
is important to me.

22:09.289 --> 22:11.129
Where...

22:18.507 --> 22:19.774
Where is he?

22:20.843 --> 22:22.153
- John did not come home
last night.

22:22.177 --> 22:23.361
- What?

22:23.437 --> 22:24.764
- John does not
come home at night.

22:24.788 --> 22:27.439
He comes home in the morning,
and smells...

22:27.516 --> 22:28.690
popular.

22:32.354 --> 22:33.548
<i>Helm.</i>

22:33.572 --> 22:35.133
- What?
- Helm.

22:35.157 --> 22:36.960
- Oh, Bernard,
this really isn't a good time.

22:36.984 --> 22:38.742
I'm creating my next sensation.

22:38.819 --> 22:40.463
I'm going to make everyone tiny,

22:40.487 --> 22:41.756
like a moth in the wind,
like a...

22:41.780 --> 22:42.988
- Helm, have you seen him?

22:43.065 --> 22:44.634
<i>- Who?</i>
- John. Is he there?

22:44.658 --> 22:47.084
- I'm not his keeper, Bernard.
That's you.

22:47.161 --> 22:49.670
Aren't you bringing him
to Henry Foster's induction?

22:49.746 --> 22:51.566
<i>Don't tell me
you lost the Savage again.</i>

22:51.590 --> 22:52.756
- No. No, I didn't.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.185
Of course...
I'm sure he'll be there.

22:54.209 --> 22:58.137
I mean, where else...

22:58.213 --> 22:59.763
I'll call you back.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.391
Summon...

23:02.468 --> 23:04.435
Lenina Crowne.

23:14.021 --> 23:15.021
Thanks.

23:16.690 --> 23:18.165
They said go that way.

23:20.444 --> 23:22.369
- You talk to the Epsilons?

23:22.446 --> 23:24.455
- Yeah. They're just people.

23:26.742 --> 23:28.843
You like them.

23:29.786 --> 23:32.783
- Well, I was them.
I used to clean people's shit.

23:32.807 --> 23:35.891
Except they've got each other.
I was alone.

23:37.812 --> 23:40.040
- That must've been terrible.

23:40.064 --> 23:42.251
- Mm, you can get
used to anything.

23:42.275 --> 23:43.582
You know, when you're a kid,

23:43.659 --> 23:45.495
if you've got an imagination,
you can survive.

23:45.519 --> 23:47.697
I used to go
on little adventures

23:47.721 --> 23:49.822
and build my own worlds.

23:51.767 --> 23:54.743
Nothing like this.

23:56.897 --> 23:58.831
- I've never been alone.

24:01.235 --> 24:03.546
We're never alone here.
Everyone's connected.

24:03.570 --> 24:05.004
Even when you sleep.

24:06.823 --> 24:08.165
- You should try
taking that thing

24:08.242 --> 24:09.925
out of your eye more often.

24:12.788 --> 24:14.930
Some things you just don't do.

24:17.459 --> 24:20.019
You know, it's...
selfish.

24:21.463 --> 24:23.709
Antisocial.
Indra would know.

24:32.307 --> 24:34.691
Why have I never been here?

24:34.768 --> 24:36.985
- Whoa. Hey.
Take it easy.

24:37.062 --> 24:40.030
- It's all just sitting here,
and we never even looked.

24:40.107 --> 24:41.573
Why?

24:41.650 --> 24:43.386
- I don't know.
You're okay.

24:43.410 --> 24:45.369
- No, I could've done things.

24:45.445 --> 24:48.413
I could've gone places,
and I've been so...

24:48.490 --> 24:50.207
- You're here now.

25:01.694 --> 25:04.846
- In the interest of stability,
we do not look back.

25:04.923 --> 25:09.101
We know the past is fraught,
complicated...

25:09.177 --> 25:11.028
most of all, it's irrelevant.

25:11.105 --> 25:13.063
We're here now, my friends.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.658
We're here together,
perfect social body.

25:15.734 --> 25:18.860
Vital, present.

25:18.937 --> 25:22.706
Dare I say,
now matters more than ever.

25:39.458 --> 25:41.662
- Psst. Henry.

25:41.686 --> 25:43.188
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

25:43.212 --> 25:44.981
He was supposed to be here,
but unfortunately,

25:45.005 --> 25:47.347
John is experiencing
what the Savages call

25:47.424 --> 25:50.767
morning sickness,
which is temporary,

25:50.844 --> 25:53.186
but... you know,
it's kind of so brutish.

25:53.263 --> 25:55.533
I think we forget sometimes
how delicate they really are,

25:55.557 --> 25:57.168
you know, but I assure you,

25:57.192 --> 25:58.703
I can make John available
for any future functions...

25:58.727 --> 26:01.028
- Bernard, it's all right.
Really.

26:01.104 --> 26:03.947
I'm glad he's not here.

26:04.024 --> 26:08.910
To be honest,
this whole Foster thing is...

26:08.987 --> 26:10.454
well, it's tiresome.

26:10.530 --> 26:11.788
It's really so much noise,

26:11.865 --> 26:13.343
and now that people
are finally moving on...

26:13.367 --> 26:15.626
- I'm sorry, moving on?
- Yes, thank goodness.

26:15.702 --> 26:18.795
I can just go back
to simply being Henry Foster,

26:18.872 --> 26:21.724
Alpha Plus,
Director of Stability,

26:21.800 --> 26:26.081
and well, you can go back to...

26:26.105 --> 26:27.512
your seat.

26:30.759 --> 26:33.977
- Um, I'm sorry, I...

26:34.054 --> 26:36.091
I really don't think
people are moving on, Henry.

26:36.115 --> 26:37.909
- Bernard...
- And as you know,

26:37.933 --> 26:40.692
my critical task
is to integrate John.

26:40.769 --> 26:43.487
- And you have.
Good job.

26:43.563 --> 26:45.041
Perhaps I don't
tell you that enough.

26:45.065 --> 26:46.373
Good job, Bernard.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.367
- Mustapha Mond herself...

26:48.443 --> 26:50.180
- You know, I think it's time
that we got you

26:50.204 --> 26:52.256
away from that Savage,
back in the office,

26:52.280 --> 26:57.209
doing work that's more worthy
of a man of your...

26:57.285 --> 26:58.285
level.

27:35.907 --> 27:37.352
- Bernard, what are you doing?

27:38.802 --> 27:40.638
- Um, can I have everybody's
attention, please?

27:40.662 --> 27:42.087
Just for... thank you.

27:42.164 --> 27:43.305
I, um...

27:43.382 --> 27:46.007
I know you were all
expecting John,

27:46.084 --> 27:47.788
and you were excited,

27:47.812 --> 27:49.928
but actually,
I have something else

27:50.005 --> 27:51.722
that I brought with me today.

27:51.798 --> 27:53.399
Better. Uh...

27:54.843 --> 27:56.768
Me.

27:56.845 --> 27:58.965
Hi, I'm Bernard Marx.

27:58.989 --> 28:00.647
I mean, you know me.

28:00.724 --> 28:02.774
I... I threw the punch.

28:02.851 --> 28:06.653
Yes,
and I was in the Savage Lands,

28:06.730 --> 28:11.074
and... I drove an auto car...

28:11.151 --> 28:14.119
which, uh... which actually
was very, very perilous.

28:14.196 --> 28:16.880
In fact... thank you.
Thanks.

28:17.708 --> 28:20.876
Um, as we were, uh, chased.

28:23.213 --> 28:26.223
Violence!
I was shot.

28:29.836 --> 28:30.894
Um...

28:32.255 --> 28:34.806
And...
Well, there was blood.

28:34.883 --> 28:37.401
And many other people
were killed.

28:40.489 --> 28:42.773
I'm sorry,
I'm gonna start again.

28:47.062 --> 28:48.996
I was in the Savage Lands.

28:51.024 --> 28:54.576
- Remember at the end?
I mean, the very end?

28:54.653 --> 28:57.023
The last few months,

28:57.047 --> 28:59.882
after the water rose
and all the birds were gone,

28:59.958 --> 29:02.259
we were all sitting
underneath the tree,

29:02.336 --> 29:03.960
all ten of us.

29:04.037 --> 29:05.657
You remember what you said?

29:05.681 --> 29:07.088
- Yes.

29:07.165 --> 29:09.591
- "Maybe the problem
is people."

29:09.668 --> 29:11.968
- And I was right.

29:12.045 --> 29:13.762
Don't give me that look.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.817
It was your idea
to turn Indra loose.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.433
- We all agreed.
- To go underground.

29:18.510 --> 29:19.790
To wait it out.

29:20.829 --> 29:23.730
And while we slept,
Indra made a world for us,

29:23.807 --> 29:27.387
made it over and over and over
till it was perfect.

29:27.411 --> 29:28.819
- We never told her
when to stop.

29:28.895 --> 29:30.175
- Why should it stop?

29:31.731 --> 29:33.885
Indra simulates.
Indra tests.

29:33.909 --> 29:35.659
Indra improves.

29:35.735 --> 29:38.036
- Or dies.
- Resets.

29:38.113 --> 29:39.505
And begins again.

29:41.675 --> 29:44.029
What do you want, Jane?

29:44.053 --> 29:47.554
- I thought...
we make decisions together

29:47.631 --> 29:48.631
as Controllers.

29:48.665 --> 29:49.998
- Oh, please.

29:50.075 --> 29:51.778
Suddenly, you're so concerned
with what we think.

29:51.802 --> 29:53.718
You went your own way,

29:53.795 --> 29:55.040
gave yourself a new name,

29:55.064 --> 29:57.639
started dressing
like a fucking wizard.

29:57.716 --> 29:59.119
- Elliott.
- No.

29:59.143 --> 30:01.070
You were supposed
to be down here with me.

30:01.094 --> 30:03.094
You said
you'd be down here with me.

30:04.073 --> 30:05.614
- Something's wrong.

30:07.451 --> 30:08.845
- You're scared.

30:12.230 --> 30:14.739
I can't read her anymore.

30:14.816 --> 30:15.958
She's different.

30:19.213 --> 30:22.289
- Indra's not different.

30:22.365 --> 30:23.434
You are.

30:24.993 --> 30:28.303
You're dying, aren't you?

30:29.789 --> 30:31.306
How long?

30:32.626 --> 30:33.842
- Who can say?

30:33.919 --> 30:36.511
- I can.

30:40.091 --> 30:41.683
So it's settled.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.588
You'll stay here.
I'll get you a towel.

30:43.612 --> 30:45.562
- I can't.
- Don't be obstinate.

30:45.639 --> 30:48.440
- I'm not finished.
- I beg to differ.

30:55.523 --> 30:56.803
Don't go.

30:59.069 --> 31:01.629
Come on.
Lay down with me.

31:02.572 --> 31:04.256
- Tide's coming in.

31:06.159 --> 31:08.343
- They're not your children.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.097
The scientists
don't name the rats.

31:14.376 --> 31:17.969
If you die out
there, it's forever.

31:20.632 --> 31:22.357
Jane.

32:32.587 --> 32:33.867
- Mm-mm.

32:34.914 --> 32:37.507
- You people have no idea
how good you have it.

32:37.584 --> 32:40.176
I know perfectly well.

32:40.253 --> 32:42.082
My life is perfect.

32:42.106 --> 32:43.622
Everyone's life is perfect.

32:43.698 --> 32:47.559
No one wants to be anything
other than what they are.

32:47.635 --> 32:51.354
- You're fucking crazy.
You gotta try this peach.

32:51.431 --> 32:54.260
- Sometimes I think
I want to be unhappy.

32:54.284 --> 32:56.037
I should've stayed
in the Savage Lands,

32:56.061 --> 32:57.981
could've been anything I wanted.

32:58.897 --> 33:00.897
- You can be anything
you want here.

33:01.199 --> 33:04.784
Right here.
There's no Indra.

33:04.861 --> 33:06.828
No one's watching.

33:06.905 --> 33:08.171
What do you want to be?

33:11.284 --> 33:13.084
We should get back.

33:13.161 --> 33:16.263
- Just say it.
I'll believe you.

33:17.165 --> 33:18.717
Just pretend.
- No.

33:18.741 --> 33:20.936
- You can be anything.
- Well, we don't do that here.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.602
Pretend.

33:24.297 --> 33:26.264
- Okay.

33:26.341 --> 33:28.442
I'll go first.

33:30.261 --> 33:33.146
I'm John.
This is my domain.

33:33.223 --> 33:36.232
Everything you see
from that peach tree

33:36.309 --> 33:38.693
to that tree over there.

33:42.315 --> 33:43.435
- You shouldn't laugh at me.

33:43.459 --> 33:45.492
I'm the last man on Earth.

33:45.568 --> 33:49.079
- Well, that's gonna limit
my options.

33:49.155 --> 33:50.872
- Yeah, it is,

33:50.949 --> 33:52.968
but on the bright side,
you're the last woman,

33:52.992 --> 33:55.886
so you're gonna get
a lot of attention.

33:57.163 --> 33:59.159
So what do we do?

33:59.183 --> 34:00.757
- We sh... we should go back.

34:00.834 --> 34:03.038
- No, we can't...
We have to do something.

34:03.062 --> 34:06.387
We're not gonna survive
if we just sit around all day.

34:06.464 --> 34:08.056
You think I should try farming?

34:08.133 --> 34:10.400
This is so stupid.

34:12.062 --> 34:13.153
- You're right.

34:15.265 --> 34:17.240
That's gonna take way too long.

34:18.693 --> 34:20.401
I'll fish.

34:20.478 --> 34:22.162
What are you gonna do?

34:23.565 --> 34:25.791
- I can't do anything.

34:27.402 --> 34:29.369
- Close your eyes.

34:29.445 --> 34:31.713
- John. Ahh...
- Shh, shh, shh.

34:36.244 --> 34:37.697
You gotta picture it.

34:39.848 --> 34:42.173
It's just us.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.341
No one else.

34:45.253 --> 34:48.500
Little house
we built with our hands.

34:48.524 --> 34:51.808
The land's gonna give us
everything we need,

34:51.885 --> 34:53.885
but we're gonna
have to work for it.

35:08.610 --> 35:10.129
Close your eyes.

35:27.271 --> 35:29.053
- Thank you.

35:29.130 --> 35:30.555
- Yes, you must be parched.

35:30.632 --> 35:32.682
That went on
for such a very long time.

35:32.759 --> 35:34.276
- I know.

35:34.352 --> 35:36.403
I know. I...

35:37.981 --> 35:40.648
Couldn't even stop myself.

35:40.725 --> 35:42.536
Not even sure what happened.
I think maybe my levels...

35:42.560 --> 35:44.736
- It's not your levels, Bernard.

35:44.812 --> 35:47.739
- These things happened to me,
Helm.

35:47.815 --> 35:49.210
I was shot.
- Bernard.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.533
- I drove an auto car.

35:50.610 --> 35:51.868
- Are we doing that again?

35:51.945 --> 35:54.212
Could you spare me a red,
please?

35:54.289 --> 35:56.276
- There's no need to be unkind.
- Isn't there, though?

35:56.300 --> 35:58.875
I mean, being gentle with you
doesn't seem to penetrate.

35:58.952 --> 36:01.669
You continue to insist
on being more than you are.

36:01.746 --> 36:04.214
- I am an Alpha Plus, Helm.

36:04.290 --> 36:05.381
- Are you, though?

36:05.458 --> 36:07.579
- How can...

36:07.603 --> 36:09.763
I'm an Alpha Plus.
- You don't believe that.

36:09.837 --> 36:13.356
Inside.
You never have.

36:17.679 --> 36:20.405
So it's going to be
one of those evenings.

36:25.812 --> 36:29.122
It's not your story
they don't like, Bernard.

36:29.199 --> 36:30.573
It's not even you.

36:30.650 --> 36:34.577
Fact is,
you're not the new thing,

36:34.654 --> 36:37.956
and they want the new thing
because with every new thing,

36:38.032 --> 36:39.635
there's a chance
that it could be the big thing.

36:39.659 --> 36:42.085
So we give them a new thing.

36:42.161 --> 36:45.639
Bigger, hotter, harder, faster.

36:45.715 --> 36:48.258
We have to give it to them
like that, Bernie,

36:48.334 --> 36:49.884
because if we don't,
they might realize

36:49.961 --> 36:52.354
that the new thing
isn't new at all.

36:52.430 --> 36:55.056
It's really just the old thing,
but more of it.

36:55.133 --> 36:57.809
And if it's old, it's boring,

36:57.885 --> 37:01.341
and if it's boring,
they will turn it off,

37:01.365 --> 37:04.941
and they'll be alone
with their thoughts.

37:05.018 --> 37:06.846
We know where that leads,
don't we?

37:08.855 --> 37:12.374
People don't want to be small.
They want to be big.

37:12.450 --> 37:15.076
I'll make people big.

37:15.153 --> 37:17.495
I'll make giants,
and they'll crush buildings.

37:17.572 --> 37:20.498
People want to be giant,
don't they?

37:22.827 --> 37:24.502
- People want to be Savages.

37:24.579 --> 37:25.962
- They do not.

37:26.039 --> 37:27.867
- No, they do.
Listen to me.

37:27.891 --> 37:31.092
People want to feel what
it's like to live another life,

37:31.169 --> 37:32.938
to be free from themselves.
- Stop it.

37:32.962 --> 37:34.374
- No, but we could do it.
You could do it.

37:34.398 --> 37:35.689
John could tell us stories,

37:35.765 --> 37:36.900
and you could record
his emotions...

37:36.924 --> 37:38.199
- Stop.

37:38.276 --> 37:39.954
- A feeling
that no one's ever felt before.

37:39.978 --> 37:41.381
Helm, it could be a phenomenon,

37:41.405 --> 37:43.332
the sensation
to end all sensations.

37:43.356 --> 37:45.534
- The only one who wants to be
that Savage, Bernard, is you.

37:45.558 --> 37:47.011
- No, I don't.
- Face it.

37:47.035 --> 37:49.389
John is not dangerous or violent

37:49.413 --> 37:52.030
or full of Savage madness.

37:52.106 --> 37:56.200
Your boy likes sex and soma
like every Beta in New London.

37:56.277 --> 37:57.618
Come to think of it,

37:57.695 --> 37:59.548
there's nothing really
all that Savage about him.

37:59.572 --> 38:00.772
- Where are you going?

38:00.849 --> 38:02.634
- I've got to get back
to the party.

38:02.658 --> 38:04.634
- Oh, I'll... I'll come with you.

38:09.874 --> 38:11.560
You know, why don't... um,
why don't you go ahead?

38:11.584 --> 38:13.037
Actually, I'll...

38:13.061 --> 38:15.039
- You've had your moment
in the glow, Bernie.

38:15.063 --> 38:18.231
That's something.

38:18.308 --> 38:20.233
But it's gone.

38:20.310 --> 38:21.901
Don't chase it.

38:29.394 --> 38:32.640
- At the end of the day,

38:32.664 --> 38:35.123
the sun goes down,
and I come in.

38:37.085 --> 38:39.085
And we tell each other...

38:40.822 --> 38:45.249
About the little things we did
to keep each other alive.

38:45.326 --> 38:48.086
You caught a fish.

38:48.162 --> 38:49.846
- I did.

38:51.332 --> 38:52.932
- We should cook it.

38:54.168 --> 38:56.436
- I'm not that hungry right now.

38:58.214 --> 39:00.523
- Why don't you
come over by the fire?

39:08.191 --> 39:09.532
- Warm here.

39:11.144 --> 39:13.144
- Don't talk.
I want to look at you.

39:20.695 --> 39:22.954
I went hunting today.

39:23.030 --> 39:25.109
- You did?

39:25.133 --> 39:27.050
For what?

39:28.703 --> 39:32.296
- White-tailed deer beast.

39:32.373 --> 39:34.015
- Did you get one?

39:37.295 --> 39:38.812
You will.

42:29.191 --> 42:30.933
- I'm starving.

42:31.010 --> 42:32.852
Gary, do me a favor.

42:32.928 --> 42:35.938
If you could make
that pie with the chicken.

42:39.777 --> 42:41.202
Gary.

42:43.105 --> 42:44.684
Sorry, I don't mean
to be a dick here,

42:44.708 --> 42:47.867
but if you could make the pie.

42:47.943 --> 42:49.586
- Where were you?

42:50.196 --> 42:53.289
- Oh, shit.
Bernard, I'm sorry.

42:53.366 --> 42:54.551
I missed your thing.

42:54.575 --> 42:56.042
- You missed my thing.

42:56.118 --> 42:58.197
- I feel bad.
I'll make it up to you.

42:58.221 --> 42:59.681
Get dressed, we'll go
to the Pleasure Garden.

42:59.705 --> 43:02.256
- No, John.
No more Pleasure Gardens.

43:02.333 --> 43:03.333
It's over.

43:04.251 --> 43:05.476
- What do you... what's over?

43:05.553 --> 43:07.053
- You are.

43:07.129 --> 43:08.398
No more parties.
No more stories.

43:08.422 --> 43:11.098
No more pretty Betas
reminding you of someone,

43:11.175 --> 43:12.892
which, let's be honest,

43:12.968 --> 43:14.571
was the one part
no one really quite believed.

43:14.595 --> 43:16.716
- I was thinking we could do
a different thing there.

43:16.740 --> 43:18.659
- Oh, no, sorry.
You don't understand.

43:18.683 --> 43:21.692
It's done.
They've moved on.

43:21.769 --> 43:22.952
No one cares.

43:25.064 --> 43:26.559
- Can you excuse us, Gary?

43:26.583 --> 43:28.491
- Gary, stay.

43:28.567 --> 43:29.847
Look at me.

43:31.821 --> 43:33.046
- Go in the hall, Gary.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.875
Wait in the hall, Gary.

43:37.952 --> 43:40.878
- He won't.
He can't.

43:40.955 --> 43:42.432
It's his conditioning.
He's a Gamma.

43:42.456 --> 43:46.884
I'm an Alpha Plus,
and you're a what, exactly?

43:46.961 --> 43:49.041
You're not even really
a Savage, are you?

43:50.348 --> 43:52.273
- I would check your levels,
man.

43:52.350 --> 43:54.528
- We thought you'd be dangerous
and violent and untamed,

43:54.552 --> 43:55.552
but you're not.

43:55.603 --> 43:58.688
You're just...

43:58.764 --> 43:59.989
Sad.

44:05.896 --> 44:07.136
- What the fuck are you doing?

44:07.189 --> 44:08.542
- Not surprising,
given your mother.

44:08.566 --> 44:09.960
Poor thing thought
she had a future here.

44:09.984 --> 44:10.866
It's probably better that she...

44:10.943 --> 44:12.271
- One more word, and I end you.

44:12.295 --> 44:13.911
- Oh, I'd like to see you try.

44:13.988 --> 44:18.582
I'm sure everyone...

44:18.659 --> 44:20.543
would like to see you try.

44:27.209 --> 44:30.636
- Look at that, Bernard.
You got yourself a Foster.

44:30.713 --> 44:32.083
- It's a Marx!

44:36.761 --> 44:38.185
- Oh, there you are.

44:38.262 --> 44:40.031
Did you let them
start the orgy without me?

44:40.055 --> 44:40.938
Of course not.

44:41.015 --> 44:42.281
You're just in time.

44:43.768 --> 44:45.943
Do you ever get tired of it?

44:46.020 --> 44:48.654
All these parties.

44:48.731 --> 44:49.958
The orgies.

44:54.904 --> 44:56.495
- What are they watching?

44:56.572 --> 44:58.038
If you say Marco Hoover...

44:58.115 --> 45:00.708
- No.
I think it's some Gamma's feed.

45:00.785 --> 45:04.128
- Gamma?
Oh, do be serious.

45:11.837 --> 45:13.846
- Bernard.

45:13.923 --> 45:16.858
You dirty little genius.

45:30.147 --> 45:32.248
- All right, hit me.
Come on.

45:33.509 --> 45:34.753
Harder.
Everyone's watching.

45:34.777 --> 45:36.535
I'm trying!

45:38.664 --> 45:42.208
- Soft-ass minus of a man!

45:42.284 --> 45:44.054
You want to know
where I was today?

45:44.078 --> 45:47.755
- Stop, stop.
- Want to know who I was with?

45:47.832 --> 45:49.193
Mm-hmm.

45:49.217 --> 45:51.383
I'll kill you, Savage!

46:07.184 --> 46:09.860
- S... stop... stop transmitting.

46:28.455 --> 46:30.631
Is that true?

46:30.708 --> 46:32.508
About Lenina?

46:51.120 --> 46:53.204
<i>- You're not playing
by the rules.</i>

46:57.118 --> 46:59.085
<i>Elliott can't help you.</i>

47:02.990 --> 47:05.383
<i>None of them can.</i>

47:07.044 --> 47:11.088
You want answers.
I respect that.

47:11.165 --> 47:12.809
I know how much
you hate the dark.

47:12.833 --> 47:14.475
- Stop.

47:15.836 --> 47:18.053
I want you to stop.

47:18.130 --> 47:20.106
This isn't... it's not a game.

47:23.886 --> 47:26.604
This isn't a simulation.

47:26.680 --> 47:29.189
- How can you tell?

47:29.266 --> 47:30.970
- How can you?

47:30.994 --> 47:33.193
- Because I'm perfect.

47:33.270 --> 47:35.487
You should know that.

47:35.564 --> 47:36.989
You made me.

47:40.653 --> 47:42.661
Hold your breath.
