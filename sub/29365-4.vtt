00:07.132 --> 00:08.967
I haven't done this for 50 years.

00:10.218 --> 00:13.096
But I think after I propose,
you're supposed to talk.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.348
[Joanne gasps]

00:15.682 --> 00:16.766
[dog barks in distance]

00:18.226 --> 00:20.395
Sorry, Beau. I can't marry you.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.523
What?

00:24.399 --> 00:25.942
You're moving too fast.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.279
That's something
I've never been accused of.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.032
What's going on?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.871
We're only living together
'cause my house burned down.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.331
Otherwise, we wouldna done it, and...

00:40.540 --> 00:43.543
You're just asking me to marry you
'cause you think you should.

00:44.002 --> 00:44.961
That's not true.

00:46.046 --> 00:46.921
I love you,

00:47.088 --> 00:48.798
and I thought you felt the same way.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.302
Please, my answer's no.

00:53.136 --> 00:53.970

00:54.888 --> 00:56.264

Or am I super early for tomorrow?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.063
Look, I'm sorry.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.606
I barely got any sleep last night.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.818
Mary disappeared
and I haven't found her yet.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.154
Hold on. We talked about this.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.489
Before we partnered back up,

02:36.865 --> 02:39.951
you promised me that
this Mary shit wouldn't be my problem.

02:40.785 --> 02:44.622
I just told you Mary's missing,
and that's what you have to say about it?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.294
You know what? Fuck it.
It's not your problem.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.461
Let's work.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.298
Yeah, I've been working
for about an hour there, bud.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.092
Well, you're making great progress.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.514
I see your oil cap here says
"Yoo-hoo" on it.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.227
Yeah, well, we can't always afford
new parts, alright?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.564
To be fair, I did buy that Yoo-hoo
at an AutoZone.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.608
[Luke] Well...

03:12.150 --> 03:15.486
you're not gonna wanna hear this
but we got a cracked engine block.

a thousand dollars.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.621

last night?

03:25.330 --> 03:26.831
A pair of edible underwear

03:26.915 --> 03:28.458

I don't even wanna know.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.635
Well... I don't know what you wanna do,

03:38.718 --> 03:41.095

until we get a new block.

03:42.096 --> 03:42.931
Shit.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.476
But didn't you say you got, like...

03:47.644 --> 03:48.937
a bit of money left over?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.648
I had, yeah. It's gone.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.608
Gone? What happened?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.526
I lent it to somebody.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.694
Lent it to who?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.529
-Oh, fuck me sideways!
-What?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.409
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:03.534 --> 04:04.994
She was late on her mortgage.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.538
I didn't think she'd run off
with the money.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.792
But what did you think
she was gonna spend it on? Lollipops?

04:12.752 --> 04:15.838
It's my money. So...
I'll do whatever the fuck I want with it.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.548

Listen, this woman
is gonna ruin your life.

Nobody knows this town better than you.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.395

who she'd talk to.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.521
Where she might be?

04:31.604 --> 04:34.315
I know you don't give a shit
but I'm worried about her.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.402
Alright.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.864
If anyone in this town's doing drugs,

04:41.948 --> 04:43.992
there's a guy named Shaggy
that'll know about it.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.245
And if you're in the market
for an exotic pet,

04:47.328 --> 04:50.206
he might be able to hook you up
with a snake or a chinchilla.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.086
I wish I had chinchilla money.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.342
Look, don't worry about this tractor,
we'll figure it out.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.052
Figure it out.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.556
That's all we do. We figure shit out
and then something else pops up.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.267
It's like a never-ending fish's cycle.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.106
A... "fish's cycle"?

05:18.651 --> 05:19.569
Yeah.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.821
The phrase is "vicious cycle."

05:22.030 --> 05:25.533
[sniggers]

05:25.992 --> 05:27.076
No.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.537
It's fish's cycle.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.748
Like a fish trying to ride a bicycle,

05:31.831 --> 05:34.125
it ain't got no legs,
it just sits there going...

It would get real frustrated.

You're not homeschooling Peyton,
are you?

05:49.932 --> 05:50.767
Whatever.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.367
Hey, Beau.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.078

06:13.289 --> 06:15.249
Almost signed up for an e-mail account.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.252
Sorry I worried you.

06:18.961 --> 06:22.298
Stayed in a motel last night.
I just needed a little time alone.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.050
[cow mooing in distance]

06:25.051 --> 06:26.469
[Beau] I'm just glad you're back.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.974
And I'm sorry if I was rushin' things.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.061
We don't have to get married.

Saves me watching Colt and Dale cry
when I...

06:39.732 --> 06:42.068
tell them I want my best man to be Drake.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.282
There's something I've been trying
to figure out how to tell you.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.369
And when you asked me to marry you,
it just...

06:51.619 --> 06:53.121
caught me by surprise.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.499
So what's going on?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.629
I went to the doctor a few weeks back
and they did a bunch of tests...

07:06.759 --> 07:08.845
I'm in the early stages of Alzheimer's.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.054
Oh.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.306
Jesus!

07:17.311 --> 07:18.438
I'm so sorry.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.025
Are they sure?

07:25.695 --> 07:27.488
Maybe we could go to somebody else.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.450
I forget stuff all the time.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.952
The other day, I was in there,

07:33.619 --> 07:35.621
spent 20 minutes looking for my glasses

07:35.705 --> 07:38.291
before I realized
I don't wear any fucking glasses.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.880
Honestly, I wasn't that surprised
when they told me.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.968
One day, I went for my usual walk
around the lake and...

07:50.887 --> 07:51.721
[sighs]

07:53.514 --> 07:54.599
...all of a sudden...

07:57.810 --> 08:00.271
I looked around and I had no idea
where I was.

08:00.938 --> 08:01.772
It was...

08:02.523 --> 08:03.357
terrifying.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.112
I was in a place that I'd been
a thousand times before...

08:08.946 --> 08:10.198
nothing looked familiar.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.574
It was...

08:13.242 --> 08:15.703
It was like I was a stranger
in my own life.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.957
Why didn't you tell me about this?

08:20.249 --> 08:21.584
What was I gonna say? I...

08:22.168 --> 08:24.003
I got lost walking around the lake?

08:24.086 --> 08:26.172
It's embarrassing, it's a fucking circle!

08:29.300 --> 08:31.052
Yeah, like you said, it's early.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.097
No telling what they'll come up with
to treat it.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.058
Well, thanks.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.770
But the reality is, at some point, my...

08:41.646 --> 08:43.439
my little granddaughter is gonna...

08:43.814 --> 08:46.442
give me a hug
and I'm not gonna know who she is.

08:51.822 --> 08:52.657
Love you.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.203
I love you, too.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.748
We'll get through it. Together.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.170
Beau... I've already made arrangements.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.965
I'm gonna go live with my daughter
in Arizona. [sniffs]

09:09.382 --> 09:10.216
-What?
-I've been...

09:10.299 --> 09:12.260
trying to find a good time to tell you.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.344
You're leaving?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.805
I don't want you taking care of me.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.266
I want you to remember me like I am.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.183
Joanne, it's--

09:19.267 --> 09:20.935
Stop now. Please.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.270
This is hard enough.

09:23.145 --> 09:26.023
-I made up my mind. I'm leaving tonight.
-Tonight?

09:26.107 --> 09:28.568
The longer I stay,
the harder it'll be to leave.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.236
This is the right decision.

09:31.862 --> 09:35.199
Besides, I took care of my daughter
when she was all methed out

09:35.283 --> 09:38.035
and couldn't remember her own name.
So she owes me one.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.998
-Can't we talk about this?
-No.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.041
There's nothing more to say.

09:51.757 --> 09:52.592
Hey.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.510
Where the hell have you been?

09:54.885 --> 09:57.555
I was with that Shaggy guy
you were telling me about.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.140
Thanks for hooking us up.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.143
He made me meet him
down at the strip club.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.231
He said the girls don't really twirl
around the pole,

10:07.315 --> 10:08.858
the pole just rotates.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.862
Like findin' out there's no Santa Claus.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.283
Has he seen Mary?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.578
No, but he's gonna ask around.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.748
Oh. On Halloween, you should bring Peyton
down to the club,

10:23.831 --> 10:26.042
because they're gonna do
trick or treat for the kids.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.504
The strippers are gonna dress up
in costumes.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.592
Then take 'em off at some point.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.721
What did you wanna show me?

10:39.138 --> 10:42.308
Oh. Alright. Well, I Googled
"how to make money with cows,"

10:42.975 --> 10:45.686
which led me to how McDonald's
makes money with cows,

10:45.770 --> 10:47.521
which led me down to McDonald's.

10:48.064 --> 10:51.067
Yea-- Can you believe it?
Fuck-- Mike Perrier works there.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.654
If you went to high school with me
that would blow your mind.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.988
We all thought he was dead.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.449
Turns out he just lost an arm
in a tractor incident.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.370
-Took forever to get my McFlurry.
-Hmm.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.123
You know what? I've seen that dude
at the McDonald's.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.376
I was there and something got stuck
in the deep fryer.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.295
He took those pinchers,
slammed them right in there,

11:11.379 --> 11:12.254
popped it out.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.132
So fucking cool!

11:15.966 --> 11:19.345
Yeah, anyway. So that McDonald's,
they got that free Wi-Fi,

11:19.637 --> 11:21.055
so I'm surfing around etc,

11:21.138 --> 11:23.516
and I come across this website
called "Crowd Cow."

11:23.724 --> 11:24.600
Crowd Cow.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.811
Isn't that the capital of Poland?

11:29.897 --> 11:31.649
No. I don't know. Maybe.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.945
Anyways, so it's a website, right?

11:36.362 --> 11:39.323
It helps independent ranchers
sell their cows

11:39.407 --> 11:40.741
directly to the customer.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.035
-I don't--
-There's no middle man.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.287
-That means more money for us, right?
-Ah.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.873
It's like slipping ten bucks
to the guy driving the Bud truck,

11:47.957 --> 11:49.792
he tells his boss
a case fell off the back,

11:49.875 --> 11:51.794
I wake up in a ditch and everybody happy.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.506
Ditches are Earth's hammocks.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.757
I've said that.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.511
Look, if this was such a great idea,

12:00.594 --> 12:02.513
why isn't every rancher doing this?

12:02.596 --> 12:04.932
I'm sure they said that
about the guy who invented the helmet

12:05.015 --> 12:07.685
with the two beers going in
and the crazy straw.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.312
The other night, I'm feeding Peyton
with the bottle,

12:10.396 --> 12:12.523
and I take down two beers
at the same time.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.736
So, you know, excuse me
if I ain't afraid of being an innovator.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.656
Okay, so you're saying

12:20.740 --> 12:23.743
this is the ranching equivalent
to the beer helmet?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.497
Buddy, I'm in.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.002
Okay. Now, all we gotta do
is make up a little profile here.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.378
-That's where you come in.
-Okay.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.381
Alright? You gotta post up
some pictures of the cows,

12:37.465 --> 12:38.883
of us looking cool as shit,

12:39.133 --> 12:41.886
and then write something
about what makes us so special.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.847
Oh, and by the way,
this is what makes us so special.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.685
You're more than that, Colt.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.980
What makes you special is your brain.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.569
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.948
Well, I can make us a kick-ass profile.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.700
When I got divorced, I...

13:04.950 --> 13:07.161
I joined some online dating websites.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.455
Oh, it's easy. I know exactly what works.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.583
We just have to put a sweet potato
in the cows' underpants.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.589
I've done that.

13:21.967 --> 13:22.968
[phone beeps]

13:25.262 --> 13:26.096
Ya got there?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.265
-Oh shit!
-What?

13:29.099 --> 13:30.017
It's Heather.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.728
Cops are at their place.
They're evicting them.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.730
Evict... What the hell? Why?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.899
That wasn't the first payment she missed.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.275
I gotta go down there.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.320
Woah! You're leaving now?

13:41.570 --> 13:42.863
Yeah. They need my help.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.365
Yeah, okay, well, so do I.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.826
We'll finish this up
and then you go there.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.118
I gotta go over there!

13:48.661 --> 13:49.954
Okay? You can do this.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.164
Okay, yeah.
You know what? Fine. Thank you.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.291
I guess I'll just do it myself.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.044
You got this. Remember:

13:57.878 --> 13:58.754
You're special.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
[door knocks]

14:04.385 --> 14:06.011
Hey. You alright?

14:06.720 --> 14:07.930
Yeah, I'm great!

14:08.180 --> 14:09.682
You live in a place for 20 years,

14:09.765 --> 14:12.017
then, suddenly,
you get 12 hours to move out.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.687
It's like the worst HGTV show ever.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.858
Come on, Wilkerson,
don't you have better things to do?

14:19.024 --> 14:21.235
I saw your girlfriend is having
a yard sale.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.444
It's just her...

14:23.320 --> 14:24.280
in the yard.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.448
I don't wanna be doing this.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.077
So why not cut her a break,
go get some dinner and lose the paperwork?

14:30.452 --> 14:31.954
'Cause they'll just send someone else,

14:32.037 --> 14:34.832
who'll kick you guys out
and put a padlock on the door.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.917
I'm giving you a chance
to get your stuff out.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.836
Yeah, it's not his fault.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.881
-Thank you.
-Oh, fuck you, Wilkerson!

14:43.465 --> 14:44.925
Wanna help put things in boxes?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.011
I got a friend coming with a U-Haul.

14:47.595 --> 14:51.056
Sure, this Tupperware of baby carrots,
that staying or going?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.266
No. Those are mine.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.478
I lost 15 pounds. Thanks for noticing.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.398
Your ass found them.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.404
Hey, if you and your sister need
a place to stay,

15:05.529 --> 15:07.072
I can put you up at the hunting cabin.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.241
Thanks, but I'm gonna go stay at Nikki's.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.744
Darlene's taking her kids
to her boyfriend's.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.329
He parks his RV at McDonald's,

15:13.412 --> 15:15.789
so the kids can use the play place
whenever they want.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.626
You know, there's a guy at that McDonald's

15:18.709 --> 15:20.544
who's got a super-cool hook hand.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.588
Yeah. It's Darlene's boyfriend.

15:22.963 --> 15:23.881
Oh.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.966
Any word on your mom?

15:26.467 --> 15:28.344
Um... not since last night.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.888
I don't even know what to do anymore.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.099
How about you?

15:34.183 --> 15:36.143
Why don't you hop on
your Fisher-Price radio

15:36.226 --> 15:37.645
and call up a full-size cop?

15:39.730 --> 15:41.690
Hey, I can make a few calls, but...

15:42.483 --> 15:45.486
unless a crime's been committed,
I can't put out an official APB.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.779
She took my car.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.530
My name's on the title.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.699
Heather, that's grand theft auto.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.662
Yeah, if she gets arrested for that,
she's looking at serious jail time.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.538
It's better than finding her dead.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.123
Are you sure?

15:58.666 --> 16:02.252
I've sent family members to jail,
and Christmas has never been the same.

16:04.713 --> 16:05.547
Call it in.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.174
Okay.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.102
Dad?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.230
[Beau] Hey.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.775
It's two in the morning.
What you doin' up?

16:25.442 --> 16:28.278
Oh shit! Are the Broncos playing
in London again?

16:30.447 --> 16:32.574
I mean, man, you know, fuck England!

16:32.658 --> 16:36.328
Where they get off naming that big,
ole clock after Ben Roethlisberger?

16:40.499 --> 16:41.375
You okay?

16:44.878 --> 16:47.381
Joanne got diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.261
Fuck.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.431
You're kidding, right?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.435
She hasn't told anybody, so...

17:00.519 --> 17:01.979
keep this between you and me.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.397
[Colt] Yeah, of course.

17:05.774 --> 17:06.692
[Colt groans]

17:09.028 --> 17:09.862
That's crazy.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.033
She seemed fine.

17:15.034 --> 17:15.868
Yeah.

17:17.745 --> 17:20.080
She'd been having some issues
with her memory.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.502
I didn't know anything about it.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.880
She's been going through this...

17:28.422 --> 17:29.256
all alone.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.595
Where is she?

17:36.388 --> 17:38.932
She went to live with her daughter,
in Phoenix.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.268
Phoenix?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.354
She ought to be with you.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.108
You're a grumpy, miserable man,

17:48.192 --> 17:50.569
but when you're with Joanne,
you're just grumpy.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.740
Not my decision.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.622
[Colt] So, what? You just...

18:03.040 --> 18:04.541
ain't never gonna see her again?

18:05.417 --> 18:06.293
I don't know.

18:08.003 --> 18:11.048
I mean if she stayed,
dunno what the hell I could do for her.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.260
When Rooster died,
there was a funeral plan...

18:16.970 --> 18:19.306
to make sure
you and your mother were okay.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.183
But now...

18:23.102 --> 18:24.228
I don't know.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.357
There's gotta be something you can do.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.235
Even if it's...

18:32.152 --> 18:33.445
just being there for her.

18:36.073 --> 18:36.907
Yeah.

18:42.329 --> 18:46.208
She is the sweetest,
most caring person I have ever met.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.965
I want to tell her it's gonna be okay,
but it...

18:54.049 --> 18:55.300
She knows it's not.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.179
We both know it's...

19:00.556 --> 19:02.516
never gonna be "okay" again.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.983
Fucking fish's cycle.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.162
Hey.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.413
Hey!

19:24.580 --> 19:25.581
Uh-oh!

19:26.123 --> 19:27.624
[baby voice] Look at his face!

19:27.708 --> 19:30.252
He's thinking really hard
and that hurts Daddy.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.004
[Abby laughs]

19:32.254 --> 19:34.381
What's going on?
Another letter to L'Oreal?

19:34.798 --> 19:38.468
You know they're never gonna bring back
just-outta-bed hair texturizer.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.931
[sighs] I'm just working on that stupid
Crowd Cow thing I told you about.

19:43.056 --> 19:44.933
-[Abby] Hmm.
-By the way, fuck L'Oreal.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.769
There's a new sheriff in town.
His name's Paul Mitchell.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.606
I thought you were excited
about making a bunch of money.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.858
Yeah, I was.
I worked on the ranch all day,

19:52.941 --> 19:55.485
and I get back,
I gotta do this stupid profile,

19:55.569 --> 19:57.654
'cause Luke bailed on me. Again.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.572
[Abby] Hmm.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.825
They want a story about me,
the herd, the history of the ranch.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.495
I'm a rancher, Ab.
I'm not Ernest... Goes to Camp.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.874
I think you meant Hemingway.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.376
I dunno what the name
of the camp was, Ab.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.631
I just know I can't do this.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.007
[sighs]

20:17.216 --> 20:19.718
The last chance to save the ranch
and I'm shitting the bed.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.012
Okay. I'm sure it's not that bad.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.097
Listen, let me take a look at it. Here.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.433
-Come here, sweetie.
-Alright. Let's see it.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.851
-[Peyton gurgles]
-[Colt] Alright.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.144
[Abby sighs]

20:29.519 --> 20:31.480
-Yeah, Daddy shit the bed.
-[Colt sighs]

20:33.523 --> 20:34.900
I told you I suck at it.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.361
The only reason I passed freshman English

20:37.444 --> 20:38.487
was I slept with the...

20:39.947 --> 20:40.781
textbook.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.743
Do you want me to help you?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.955
You ain't gotta do that,
I'm sure you got stuff to do.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.499
I was just gonna drink wine
and grade some papers.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.542
I mean, I could just give everyone a B.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.045
Everyone would be happy,
except Melissa Anderson,

20:55.128 --> 20:56.630
but she could use the ego hit.

20:57.714 --> 20:58.548
You sure?

20:58.632 --> 21:01.551
Yeah. I mean, I want to.
I love writing, it's fun.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.888
Woah! Hey! Don't say stuff like that
in front of our daughter.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.807
-[Peyton grumbles]
-You hear that?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.725
We like looking at the pictures, don't we?

21:11.311 --> 21:12.521
[keys jingling]

21:14.231 --> 21:17.109
Ah. Good! Tell them this is a mistake.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.570
It's my car, too! I got 300 bucks off
when I flashed the salesman.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.741
You aren't even supposed to be in here.
So make it quick.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.493
When I get outta here,

21:26.576 --> 21:29.496
my Nachos BellGrande better be
with my stuff, you fat fuck.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.376
-[scoffs]
-[door closes]

21:34.710 --> 21:36.878
-[keys rattle in lock]
-What the hell, Mary?

21:38.255 --> 21:41.133
You steal the money,
you just disappear for two days?

21:41.216 --> 21:42.634
I didn't steal anything.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.887
I went to the ATM and there was
a ton of money in my account.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.848
I figured it was a banking error.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.310
When I found a 20 on the floor at church,
I didn't look for the owner.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.312
So you still have the money?

21:53.395 --> 21:54.396
Yeah, I have it.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.315
I mean, I did have it.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.524
-[Heather] Jesus!
-I...

21:57.607 --> 21:59.443
I got a job interview.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.777
I had to get a new dress.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.571
Am I gonna, like, show up in my old--

22:02.654 --> 22:05.282
Can you just stop fucking lying?

22:05.741 --> 22:08.035
You're in jail, Mom!

22:08.618 --> 22:09.953
You got us evicted!

22:10.037 --> 22:13.540
-Oh, fu-- Those bastards evicted us?
-Yeah.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.336
And you knew about it, 'cause you were
the one hiding all the notices.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.922
What else is it gonna take for you
to finally admit you have a problem?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.300
I've been putting up with your shit
for so long!

22:23.383 --> 22:24.885
I'm finally over it!

22:24.968 --> 22:27.054
Come on. Sweetie, I can fix this!

22:27.137 --> 22:29.222
Remember the Christmas
we had no money for presents?

22:29.306 --> 22:32.059
I rigged that McDonald's Monopoly game,
and got us a CD.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.101
[chuckles]

22:35.062 --> 22:35.896
Just save it.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.066
We came here to tell you
we're not bailing you out.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.568
What are you talking about?

22:41.818 --> 22:44.571
We're worried what you'd do
if you got outta here, so...

22:44.654 --> 22:47.032
we think the safest thing's
for you to stay in jail.

22:48.116 --> 22:49.576
You fucking kidding me? Do...

22:50.202 --> 22:52.412
You're an addict.
You need to get clean, Mom.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.706
Jesus Christ! An addict?

22:54.790 --> 22:55.999
Okay, you know what?

22:56.083 --> 22:58.752
If it makes you feel better,
I will go to rehab,

22:58.877 --> 23:02.255
or meetings, or whatever. Okay?
Just get me the hell outta here!

23:02.714 --> 23:03.799
Well, the thing is...

23:04.508 --> 23:06.009
we don't believe you anymore.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.012
Oh, come on!

23:09.471 --> 23:11.306
Come on! You know I'm a good person.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.600
You know how hard I've been trying.
I just...

23:14.851 --> 23:16.853
Come on! Look, I just fucked up.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.279
We wouldn't do this if we didn't love you.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.406
[Mary] Love me?

23:27.489 --> 23:28.448
[laughs] Love me.

23:29.116 --> 23:29.991
Fuck you.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.952
Fuck you! Fuck you both!

23:33.245 --> 23:34.246
Jesus...

23:40.961 --> 23:43.296
So, why would you say
you got into ranching?

23:44.381 --> 23:46.508
Well, I failed at football.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.302
They canceled American Gladiators.
So, here we are.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.681
Oh, shit! Pick six!

23:52.764 --> 23:54.766
[laughs hysterically]

23:55.225 --> 23:57.436
You even suck in video games,
Aaron Rodgers.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.938
Oh, yeah!

24:00.939 --> 24:02.399
Man, this is awesome.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.444
Just you and me,
working on a project together.

24:05.527 --> 24:07.696
It's like being back
at high school again.

24:07.779 --> 24:08.905
And just like high school,

24:08.989 --> 24:10.782
I'm doing all the work
and you're playing Xbox.

24:10.866 --> 24:11.700
[Colt] Cool!

24:12.993 --> 24:15.745
Am I playing or am I dominating?

24:17.539 --> 24:18.540
You're playing.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.502
-[keyboard clicks]
-[Peyton crying]

24:22.586 --> 24:24.671
-[Abby clears throat]
-Baby's crying.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.007
-[keyboard stops clicking]
-[crying continues]

24:27.090 --> 24:29.092
Yeah, I know.
You gonna go check on her?

24:29.176 --> 24:32.762
Babe, I'm playing a live game here.
If I pause it, I automatically lose.

24:33.388 --> 24:34.556
[crying continues]

24:34.848 --> 24:36.933
Yeah, and I'm saving the family ranch!

24:37.017 --> 24:38.602
Yeah, and you can pause that.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.854
-[crying stops]
-Wow.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.232
There you go. She stopped crying.
See, I solved it.

24:46.026 --> 24:49.279
Okay. Now, would you say
your ranching innovations are more...

24:49.613 --> 24:52.657
-um... brilliant or ingenious?
-[chuckles smugly]

24:52.741 --> 24:54.659
Okay, babe.
I don't wanna embarrass you

24:54.743 --> 24:57.287
but I'm pretty sure the word is "genius."

25:00.540 --> 25:01.458
Special.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.545
Right. I'm just gonna go with "brilliant."

25:05.879 --> 25:06.755
Okay.

25:07.047 --> 25:10.425
Well, if you wanna check out
the Bennett Brother Ranch profile,

25:10.509 --> 25:12.385
I'm pretty sure I fucking dominated.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.846
[Colt] Babe, I'm just... Babe I'm...

25:15.805 --> 25:16.640
[growls]

25:17.974 --> 25:19.559
Urgh. Okay.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.311
Woah!

25:21.978 --> 25:23.271
-This is awesome!
-Hmm.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.356
Man, look at these pict--

25:24.523 --> 25:26.900
Hold on! When did I volunteer
at a soup kitchen?

25:27.901 --> 25:29.653
[laughing] No, that's photoshopped.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.738
I used a picture of you
standing behind a keg.

25:31.821 --> 25:32.656
[Colt] Yeah!

25:33.907 --> 25:35.534
-Oh, that's great!
-[chuckles]

25:35.742 --> 25:36.826
Wait! What's this?

25:36.910 --> 25:38.703
-About "checking the herd..."
-[Ab] Yep.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.122
"...feeling the morning grass,
dew between my toes..."

25:41.206 --> 25:42.666
You go out there without boots on,

25:42.749 --> 25:44.709
you gonna feel something else
between your toes.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.255
Hey, Colt, this is what I do, okay?

25:48.338 --> 25:50.090
People are gonna love it. Trust me.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.967
I don't criticize
the way you play Madden.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.302
[scoffs] Yeah, you do, like, all the time.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.846
That's true,
but it's 'cause you suck at it.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.725
Alright. You know what?
This is what you do,

26:00.976 --> 26:02.477
so I just wanna say thank you.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.482
Would you like to say something nice
about me playing Madden?

26:09.109 --> 26:11.278
I'd love to. When you stop sucking at it,
I'll tell you.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.654
[Colt] Oooh!

26:13.613 --> 26:16.575
Right. Well, if you're ready,
I can put your profile online.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.034
-What? Already?
-Yeah.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.828
-Jesus!
-[Abby laughs]

26:19.911 --> 26:20.787
Now I'm nervous.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.248
This is gotta pay off.
It's a big moment, right?

26:23.331 --> 26:26.251
It's like when you're holding a quarter
with a scratch-off.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.545
"Come on, Blackbeard!
Show me the sunken treasure!"

26:28.628 --> 26:30.630
-[Abby chuckles]
-Hoo!

26:30.755 --> 26:31.590
Alright, done.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.925
Now, we just wait and see
if we sell some cow.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.093
[Colt] Alright.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.179
[sighs] We sell any yet?

26:39.472 --> 26:40.682
It's been three seconds.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.976
Okay. You're right. I'm just kidding.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.688
-Refresh it. Let's--
-Yeah, okay.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.441
Woah! Woah woah woah!

26:49.566 --> 26:52.319
What happened to the picture
of the cow with the potato?

27:08.835 --> 27:10.128
What are you doing here?

27:11.004 --> 27:11.921
Are you kidding?

27:12.380 --> 27:13.506
I love Arizona.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.717
Gave us Goldwater.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.260
And McCain.

27:18.386 --> 27:21.056
Only bad thing is
it's right next to California.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.808
That's where they outta build
a fucking wall.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.979
I can't believe you drove all the way
down here.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.149
I can't believe your Ford
made it all the way down here.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.151
Where'd the tow truck drop you off?

27:35.403 --> 27:37.489
I'm gonna chalk that up
to your condition.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.243
I'm never gonna forget
how shitty Fords are.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.286
[Beau laughs]

27:44.245 --> 27:45.497
What are you doing here?

27:46.414 --> 27:49.167
If this is where you wanna be,
it's where I'll be, too.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.670
Beau, you're not moving to Arizona.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.798
You can send me away, if you want.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.092
But I'll be back tomorrow.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.929
You can send me away tomorrow,
and I'll just be back the next day.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.099
I'm not going anywhere, Joanne.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.727
Well, that's very sweet, but...

28:08.561 --> 28:10.480
I'm not gonna let you take care of me.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.192
I know how you feel about male nurses
and you don't wanna be one.

28:14.275 --> 28:17.404
If you have to put the word "male"
in front of your profession,

28:18.446 --> 28:20.156
you know there's something wrong.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.870
I told you, I don't want you
to watch me decline.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.498
I don't want you to remember me that way.

28:28.790 --> 28:32.168
It's not about remembering you,
it's about being with you.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.547
You were gone one night
and I couldn't stand it.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.465
I had to talk to Colt.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.259
Jesus!

28:39.718 --> 28:40.593
I'm sorry.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.346
I got something for you.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.439
It's a photo album.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.357
I can see that.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.069
But you forgot to put any photos in it.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.238
I thought I was the one with Alzheimer's.

29:00.321 --> 29:01.239
[Beau chuckles]

29:03.241 --> 29:05.744
We're gonna spend the next few years
filling it up.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.706
That way, if you have trouble
remembering something,

29:10.331 --> 29:11.833
we can look at 'em together.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.378
I love you, Joanne.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.173
And I want to be with you

29:19.132 --> 29:20.633
whether we're married or not,

29:21.426 --> 29:22.844
whether you're sick or well,

29:23.178 --> 29:26.181
whether we live in Arizona or Colorado.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.558
Preferably Colorado.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.730
You asshole, you're gonna make me cry.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.817
Let's take the first picture right now.

29:37.901 --> 29:38.818
Oh, good!

29:39.027 --> 29:40.236
We can take a selfie.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.030
Selfie?

29:42.572 --> 29:43.490
Oh, boy.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.159
You're already making up words.

29:56.836 --> 29:57.670
[Colt] Hey.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.132
-Peyton's down. Again.
-Mm-hm.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.343
Every time I read
Goldilocks and the Three Bears,

30:03.968 --> 30:05.887
I can't help but hear my dad saying,

30:06.387 --> 30:09.557
[deep voice] "You know, those bears
woulda had every right to shoot her."

30:09.682 --> 30:10.600
[Abby chuckles]

30:11.601 --> 30:13.353
I heard him tell her the other day

30:13.436 --> 30:17.524
that the three little pigs should've just
hired a licensed and bonded contractor.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.319
-Oh, my God!
-Err, I can explain.

30:21.402 --> 30:22.737
Luke borrowed my computer.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.115
No. We just sold some of our cow.

30:26.407 --> 30:27.534
-[Colt] You serious?
-Yeah!

30:27.617 --> 30:29.994
Someone just ordered three filet bundles.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.413
-Oh, my...
-Fuck yeah!

30:32.539 --> 30:33.373
Yeah.

30:34.707 --> 30:36.584
-Holy shit!
-[Abby laughs]

30:36.960 --> 30:39.295
Oh my God! This is actually gonna work.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.131
The idea I had actually wasn't shitty!

30:42.215 --> 30:43.258
-No.
-This...

30:43.341 --> 30:46.928
This makes all that time
volunteering at the soup kitchen worth it.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.224
This was such a good idea.
I'm so happy for you.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.268
For me? You kidding me?
This is for us.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.436
I couldn't have done any of this
without you.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.563
So, thank you.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.826
[police siren]

31:13.288 --> 31:15.123
Hey, Hank. What are you in for?

31:15.456 --> 31:16.374
Littering...

31:16.958 --> 31:18.626
while intoxicated.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.627
[Mary] Hm.

31:21.129 --> 31:21.963
Okay.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.882
Sign here and you can go.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.888
Hey. Thanks for bailing me out.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.309
No problem.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.352
Glad you called me.
