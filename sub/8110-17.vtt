OH, MAN...

01:23.251 --> 01:24.852
IS THAT GUY DEAD?

01:24.885 --> 01:26.387
I THINK SO.

OFFERING SPA TREATMENTS.

OFF OF A HOTEL BALCONY.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.758
WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT?

02:37.791 --> 02:41.629

03:00.248 --> 03:01.782

SAID OUT LOUD,

03:01.815 --> 03:03.217
SOUNDS EVEN MORE
INAPPROPRIATE.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.457
WITH BURN INJURIES AND--

03:09.490 --> 03:11.625
LET ME GUESS--
DIAGNOSIS WAS FIRE.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.927
HE SAID HIS BURNING FLESH

03:13.961 --> 03:15.629
AND THE E.R. ANTISEPTICS

03:15.663 --> 03:18.632
LIKE BLUEBERRY MUFFINS.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.501
COOL.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.935
DYSOSMIA--
COULD BE ANYTHING

03:21.969 --> 03:24.538
FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR
TO AN EARLY SIGN

03:24.572 --> 03:25.973
OF A DEGENERATIVE
BRAIN DISEASE.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.643
SMELLS LIKE A WINNER.

03:29.677 --> 03:33.514
OKAY, YOU AND CHASE GO CHECK OUT
THE PARK WHERE THEY FOUND HIM.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.650
YOU TWO LOAD HIM UP
WITH PREDNISONE,

03:36.684 --> 03:38.352
GIVE HIM
AN ODOR I.D. TEST.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.021
IF HE'S STILL MISTAKING
HIS BODY ODORS FOR CANDY,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.257
THE PROBLEM'S DEFINITELY
IN HIS BRAIN.

03:43.291 --> 03:47.295
ALSO, FIND OUT WHAT ELSE
HE'S LYING ABOUT...

03:47.328 --> 03:48.929
SINCE I'M ASSUMING
"FERRIS BUELLER"

03:48.962 --> 03:50.998
IS NOT HIS REAL NAME.
WHY?

03:54.668 --> 03:58.339
SERIOUSLY,
WHO IS THAT?

03:58.372 --> 04:01.675
THEY SAY HE'S
A RIGHTEOUS DUDE.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.378
BEFORE I FORGET,
I WANT YOU TO MEET DOMINIKA.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.637
HOW'S THE ARM?
HMM?

04:29.670 --> 04:30.704
IT HURTS.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.674
DO I HAVE TO CHECK OUT NOW?

04:33.707 --> 04:34.942
NOT UNTIL
WE FIGURE OUT

04:34.975 --> 04:37.311
WHY YOUR SENSE OF SMELL
IS OFF.

04:37.345 --> 04:40.047
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME
YOU NOTICED IT?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.682
MAYBE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.917
(Foreman)
YOUR REAL NAME,U TO TELL US

04:43.951 --> 04:48.722
SO WE CAN REVIEW
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.625
I DIDN'T ASK
TO COME HERE, OKAY?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.794
I'M NOT PAYING
FOR ANY OF THIS.
DON'T WORRY.

04:53.827 --> 04:54.962
I DON'T THINK
THE COLLECTION AGENCY

04:54.995 --> 04:56.397
HAS AN OFFICE
IN THE PARK.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.800
I DON'T HAVE
A MEDICAL HISTORY.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.635
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.770
WHAT ABOUT THOSE SCARS

05:02.803 --> 05:04.905
AND BURN MARKS?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.626
WE DIDN'T EXACTLY GET ALONG
WHEN I WAS A KID.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.995
HOW MANY TIMES
WERE YOU HOSPITALIZED?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.566
NEVER.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.801
HE WAS GOOD AT IT.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.003
MADE SURE HE NEVER
DID ANYTHING

05:36.036 --> 05:38.005
THAT COULDN'T BE COVERED UP
BY A SWEATSHIRT.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.908
I'M SORRY.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.578
[chuckles]
NO, DON'T BE.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.714
I'M NOT.
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.749
THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE
TALKING ABOUT IT.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.789
[whistling]

06:03.731 --> 06:06.133
YOU CAN'T RIDE
THAT THING IN HERE.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.435
SPEAKING OF THINGS,

06:07.468 --> 06:08.869
I'M HAVING ONE
ON FRIDAY.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.871
IF YOU WANT TO DROP BY,
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.507
NO PRESSURE.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.642
YOU'RE STILL STANDING
ON IT.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.410
SO I AM.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.845
PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT
FAMILIAR

06:17.878 --> 06:20.714
WITH NEW JERSEY
HANDICAP ORDINANCES.

06:20.748 --> 06:24.184
OR PERHAPS I AM.

06:24.217 --> 06:28.021
THEY APPLY TO WHEELCHAIRS
AND POWERED SCOOTERS ONLY,

06:28.055 --> 06:29.189
NOT TOYS.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.759
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH THIS TOY COST?

06:31.792 --> 06:33.727
I DON'T CARE.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.696
FOR SOME REASON, MY LEG'S
BEEN HURTING A LOT THIS WEEK.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.731
FOR SOME REASON,
I STILL DON'T CARE.

06:37.765 --> 06:41.469
FINE.
I'LL RETURN IT.

06:41.502 --> 06:45.172
DO I HAVE TO WALK IT
OUT OF HERE?

06:45.205 --> 06:46.540
STOP.

06:46.574 --> 06:50.844
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION
FOR YOUR LEG.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.914
BUT NEXT TIME,
CHECK WITH ME FIRST.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.495
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.996
I HEAR A STRANGE VOICE.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.965
A VERY SOFT-LOOKING MAN.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.234
MUST BE THE WILSON.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.302
(House)
I KNOW WE SAID NO SECRETS,

07:15.335 --> 07:17.905
BUT I THINK I NEED TO
TAKE THIS ALONE, HONEY BUNNY.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.741
OKAY.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.511
NICE TO BE MEETING YOU.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.946
[chuckles]

07:32.620 --> 07:35.956
YOU'RE TRYING TO SCREW
WITH CUDDY.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.492
YEAH, IT'S THE CLASSIC
"YOU DUMPED ME,

07:38.526 --> 07:40.494
SO I'M GONNA GET MARRIED
A WEEK LATER" RUSE.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.896
'CAUSE NOT ONLY
IS SHE THAT STUPID,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.665
BUT APPARENTLY
I'M THAT STUPID.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.967
THEN WHAT, YOU'RE
OPENLY MOCKING MARRIAGE--

07:47.000 --> 07:48.669
TRYING TO PROVE
IT MEANS NOTHING?

07:48.702 --> 07:49.537
IT DOESN'T.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.806
BUT YOU PROVED THAT
YOURSELF YEARS AGO.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.674
I'D LOVE TO KEEP GUESSING,

07:53.707 --> 07:55.776
BUT I'VE GOT PEOPLE
WITH TUMORS WAITING.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.512
WHY DO YOU WANT US TO THINK
THAT YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

07:58.546 --> 08:00.981
ONLY ONE THEORY LEFT--
I AM.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.617
DOMINIKA NEEDS
A GREEN CARD.

08:03.651 --> 08:07.054
SO YOU'RE JUST DOING
SOME RANDOM STRANGER A FAVOR?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.523
IT'S ILLEGAL.
PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR THAT--

08:09.557 --> 08:11.024
PAY HUGE FINES.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.793
HAVE YOU SEEN ME
PRACTICE MEDICINE?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.729
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS
TO HAVE A LIVE-IN MAID,

08:15.763 --> 08:19.533
PERSONAL ASSISTANT, COOK,
MASSAGE THERAPIST, WHORE?

08:21.068 --> 08:23.036
I DO.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.906
SHE'S WILLING TO WORK
FOUR DAYS A WEEK FOR FREE.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.809
IT'S GONNA SAVE ME
ABOUT $33,000.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.912
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS SAY TWO STUPID WORDS--

08:31.945 --> 08:35.148
"I DO."

08:35.182 --> 08:37.985
AND IF SHE DOESN'T
SEE IT THIS WAY?
IRON-CLAD PRENUP--

08:38.018 --> 08:40.854
WE GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.923
YOUR STUNNED LOOK,
I TAKE IT,

08:42.956 --> 08:46.526
IS YOUR WAY OF SAYING,
"BRILLIANT IDEA, HOUSE."

08:59.907 --> 09:03.110
WOW.
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.745
THE PREDNISONE
HAS HAD TIME TO WORK,

09:04.778 --> 09:07.147
SO WE NEED TO GIVE YOU
THE ODOR I.D. TEST NOW.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.917
SURE.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.686
WE NEED YOU TO TELL US
WHAT YOU SMELL.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.087
OH...

09:14.121 --> 09:16.657
SOMETHING SPOILED...

09:16.690 --> 09:18.792
MAYBE ROTTING MEAT?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.094
IT'S BABY POWDER.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.835
I KIND OF LIKE THAT ONE.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.102
PEPPERMINT?

09:29.136 --> 09:32.005
IT'S EXTREMELY BAD
BODY ODOR.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.678
WELL, YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

09:37.711 --> 09:39.647
THAT ONE'S KIND OF
A GOOD DEAL FOR ME.

09:42.716 --> 09:43.951
MY BACKPACK.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.719
OH, WHERE'D YOU FIND IT?

09:45.753 --> 09:48.889
IN THE PARK, RIGHT NEXT
TO A BIG PILE OF QUESTIONS.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.625
(Taub)
WHAT KIND OF DRUGS
YOU SHOOTING UP?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.795
VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS.

09:54.828 --> 09:58.131
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BOOST
MY IMMUNE SYSTEM.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.701
ALL RIGHT, TEST ME
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.870
(Taub)
FERRIS TELL YOU
HIS REAL NAME YET?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.304
PETER JOHNSON.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.807
DANNY JENNINGS.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.877
I BOUGHT THOSE BOOKS USED.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.779
ALL FROM THE SAME GUY?

10:11.812 --> 10:14.782
I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW,
I THINK I SHOULD CHECK OUT NOW.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.751
AND I SHOULD--OW!

10:17.785 --> 10:18.819
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.153
OH, MY STOMACH.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.756
(Foreman)
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.999
IS ANYONE ELSE
DISTURBED BY THIS?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.300
(Foreman)
WHAT?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.035
SHE OFFERED.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.704
(Masters)
DANNY MAY HAVE LIED
ABOUT HIS NAME,

10:36.737 --> 10:38.839
BUT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE VIALS.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.975
TESTS CONFIRM THEY WERE
VITAMIN "A" AND B12.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.879
(House)
HE ALSO ENJOYS VITAMIN "H."
THE KID'S A JUNKIE.

10:45.913 --> 10:49.082
(Taub)
TOX SCREENS WERE NEGATIVE
FOR DRUG USE.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.853
HIS HAIR WASN'T.
I HAD IT TESTED...

10:52.886 --> 10:54.922
'CAUSE UNLIKE SANTA
AND THE EASTER BUNNY,

10:54.955 --> 10:57.891
HOMELESS, NON-MENTALLY ILL
20-SOMETHINGS

10:57.925 --> 10:59.927
WITHOUT DRUG PROBLEMS
DON'T EXIST.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.094
HE WAS A HEAVY USER

11:01.128 --> 11:02.830
SOMETIME IN THE LAST
FIVE MONTHS.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.765
(Foreman)
WOW.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.099
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.935
THANK YOU.
NO, THANK YOU.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.904
I LIKE A MAN
WITH THE BIG, STRONG, SEXY FEET.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.740
HE REALLY PUTS THE "MANI"
IN THE "PEDI."

11:12.773 --> 11:14.842
(Foreman)
IF HE HAS A HISTORY
OF SNORTING HEROIN,

11:14.875 --> 11:16.910
HE COULD HAVE CAUSED
THE DYSOSMIA HIMSELF.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.879
BUT WE STILL NEED TO EXPLAIN
THE BLEEDING IN HIS G.I. TRACT.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.047
VITAMIN INJECTIONS
COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT--

11:20.080 --> 11:21.949
HYPERVITAMINOSIS "A"
SYNDROME.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.751
SO HIS SYMPTOMS
AREN'T CONNECTED.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.452
HOUSE, YOU BUYING THIS?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.156
NOT USUALLY.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.059
BUT THIS GUY'S BEEN SLEEPING
ON A BED OF DOG POOP.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.794
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE'S GOT

11:33.827 --> 11:36.396
SIX DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS
FOR SIX DIFFERENT REASONS.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.465
THE BLEED COULD BE CAUSED
BY A G.I. OBSTRUCTION.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.368
(House)
VITAMIN O.D. MAKES SENSE,
AND IT'S EASIER TO TREAT.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.203
GIVE HIM TOCOPHEROL
AND ZINC SUPPLEMENTS

11:43.236 --> 11:45.038
FOR THE EXCESS VITAMIN "A."
IF WE'RE RIGHT...

11:45.072 --> 11:46.740
HE COULD GO HOMELESS
TOMORROW.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.908
(Masters)
AND IF WE'RE WRONG,

11:47.941 --> 11:49.877
HIS INTESTINES COULD GET
FURTHER DISTRESSED,

11:49.910 --> 11:52.012
WHILE WE IGNORE
THE G.I. OBSTRUCTION.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.281
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WOMEN DON'T HAVE TO SERVE MEN

11:54.314 --> 11:55.749
TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.885
THE GET ALL UPPITY.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.319
THIS IS WHY
WE INVENTED GREEN CARDS.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.055
GO X-RAY THE GUY'S ABDOMEN,

12:02.089 --> 12:04.391
IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL
ALL EQUAL.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.000
[loud bang]

12:15.568 --> 12:18.872
I NEED A FAVOR.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.373
I WANT TO ADD
MY FIANCEE'S NAME

12:20.407 --> 12:22.810
TO MY HEALTH INSURANCE
A FEW DAYS EARLY.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.144
SHE WANTS TO GET
A TOOTH CAPPED

12:24.177 --> 12:26.546
BEFORE THE BIG DAY.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.049
I'M NOT SIGNING THIS.
I AGREE.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.051
I THINK SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
THE WAY SHE IS.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.956
OH, NO, WAIT.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.891
YOU'RE NOT SIGNING THAT
FOR MORAL REASONS?

12:37.925 --> 12:42.162
YOU'RE DECLARING YOURSELF
THE SOLE ARBITER OF TRUE LOVE?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.898
'CAUSE YOU COVERED
TAUB'S WIFE FOR YEARS.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.067
IT'S FRAUD.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.171
[speaking Russian]

12:54.241 --> 12:55.375
SHE WANTED ME TO BRIBE YOU,

12:55.408 --> 12:57.077
LIKE THEY DO
BACK IN THE OLD COUNTRY.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.812
TELL HER WHAT I SAID.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.014
THIS IS AMERICA--
THE LAND OF THE HOME

13:01.048 --> 13:02.182
AND THE FREE OF THE BRAVES.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.583
YEAH, I JUST GET
TEARY-EYED

13:03.616 --> 13:06.019
EVERY TIME
I HEAR HER SAY THAT.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.021
SHE BROUGHT YOU A GIFT.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.957
ALMOND KULICH--
I MAKE WITH OWN HANDS.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.959
I-IT'S DELICIOUS.
ALMOND KULICH--

13:11.992 --> 13:15.528
HOW CAN YOU SAY NO
TO THAT?

13:15.562 --> 13:18.065
YOU REALIZE
IF I DO SIGN THIS

13:18.098 --> 13:20.100
AND YOU DON'T GET
LEGALLY MARRIED,

13:20.133 --> 13:22.135
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR INSURANCE
WITH OUR CARRIER?

13:22.169 --> 13:25.572
YES.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.143
FINE.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.080
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.885
I WISH YOU BOTH
THE BEST WITH IT.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.919
THANK YOU.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.126
NORTH, MISS TESCHMACHER!

13:48.428 --> 13:50.397
YOUR BLOOD TEST WAS CLEAN,

13:50.430 --> 13:52.532
BUT YOUR HAIR SHOWED
HEROIN USE.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.369
I'VE BEEN CLEAN
OVER THREE MONTHS NOW.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.905
HOW'D YOU KICK IT?

13:57.938 --> 14:01.308
I HAD TO DIE FIRST.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.476
I O.D.'D
BACK IN NOVEMBER,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.212
AND THEY SAID
I WAS CLINICALLY DEAD

14:05.245 --> 14:08.148
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.151
IT WAS LIKE GOD GAVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE

14:11.184 --> 14:12.986
TO DO THINGS RIGHT
THIS TIME.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.123
YOU'RE SAYING GOD
CURED YOU?

14:16.156 --> 14:20.193
NO.
STATE REHAB CURED ME.

14:20.227 --> 14:24.397
BUT I SHOULD BE DEAD,
BUT I'M NOT.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.034
IT HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.971
I MEAN, I-I MUST BE HERE
FOR A REASON, RIGHT?

14:33.173 --> 14:35.042
DID YOU FIGURE OUT
THE REASON?

14:35.075 --> 14:38.545
MY GOAL IS TO BECOME
A DOCTOR ONE DAY.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.349
I AM SMART.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.987
I MEAN, I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP
FOR PREMED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.288
CHASE...

14:50.423 --> 14:53.360
LOOK.

14:53.393 --> 14:58.431
(Masters)
WE FOUND 13 MASSES SPREAD
ACROSS THE WALL OF HIS COLON,

14:58.465 --> 15:00.333
RANGING FROM TWO
TO EIGHT MILLIMETERS.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.502
(Taub)
IT CAN'T BE TUMORS. EDGES
ARE TOO SHARP AND DEFINED.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.071
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
PARASITES,

15:04.104 --> 15:06.239
BUT WE DIDN'T SEE ANY MOVEMENT
BETWEEN X-RAY EXPOSURES.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.075
AND NO LARVAE OR EGGS
WERE OBSERVED

15:08.108 --> 15:09.476
IN ANY OF HIS
STOOL SAMPLES.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.979
WHICH IS KIND OF SURPRISING
FOR A HOMELESS JUNKIE

15:12.012 --> 15:14.214
LIVING IN A PARK.
(Chase)
EX-JUNKIE--

15:14.247 --> 15:16.083
CLAIMS HE'S BEEN CLEAN
FOR OVER THREE MONTHS.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.585
AND HE'S NOT PLANNING
ON STAYING HOMELESS.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.387
HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT
HIS HEALTH,

15:20.420 --> 15:22.990
WHICH IS WHY HE'S BEEN TAKING
VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.191
HE WANTS TO BE A DOCTOR.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.194
HE'S JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.163
ONCE AN ADDICT,
ALWAYS AN ADDICT.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.065
CAN YOU...

15:32.099 --> 15:34.134
PLEASE NOT DO THAT
IN FRONT OF ME?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.003
DOUBT IT.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.670
YOU'RE THE MAIN REASON
I'M ON THE STUFF.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.073
WE COULD BE LOOKING
AT FUNGAL MASSES

15:40.107 --> 15:41.975
HANGING OFF THE WALLS
OF HIS COLON.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.610
START HIM
ON AMPHOTERICIN "B" TONIGHT,

15:43.643 --> 15:45.145
AND IN THE MORNING,
RUN A SCOPE UP

15:45.178 --> 15:46.379
WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE,

15:46.413 --> 15:49.382
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY TRUFFLES.

15:51.084 --> 15:55.055
I THINK WE SHOULD BOYCOTT
THIS WEDDING ON PRINCIPLE.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.057
I KIND OF HAVE TO GO.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.426
HIS FIANCEE DID GIVE ME
A FOOT MASSAGE.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.195
AND HE INVITED ME
TO BE IN HIS WEDDING PARTY.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.264
W-WHAT ABOUT CHASE?
HE ASK HIM?

16:04.297 --> 16:07.067
YEP. HE'S IN IT.
WHAT THE HELL?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.469
YOU JUST SAID
YOU WEREN'T EVEN GOING.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.204
I STILL HAVE FEELINGS.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.173
WHAT'S THAT?

16:13.206 --> 16:17.277
(Foreman)
THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT
A FUNGUS.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.013
YOU WERE BLEEDING BECAUSE
YOU HAD 13 PIECES OF BONE

16:20.047 --> 16:21.281
IN YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.783
WE THINK YOU HAVE PICA,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.585
A CRAVING
FOR NONFOOD ITEMS

16:25.618 --> 16:27.554
THAT'S CAUSED
BY A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE--

16:27.587 --> 16:31.024
I DIDN'T CRAVE THEM.
I KIND OF...

16:31.058 --> 16:32.792
VOLUNTEERED
TO EAT THEM.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.028
W-WHAT? WHY?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.329
THERE'S THIS GREAT
ITALIAN RESTAURANT

16:36.363 --> 16:37.597
I LIKE TO FREQUENT.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.100
AND BY "RESTAURANT,"

16:40.133 --> 16:42.035
I MEAN THEIR DUMPSTER
OUT BACK.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.271
THE COOK IS KIND OF
A FRIEND OF MINE.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.339
HE CHALLENGES ME
TO EAT STUFF.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.640
SOMETIMES IT'S RAW SQUID,

16:47.674 --> 16:49.776
OR, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO CHEW
ON A CHICKEN BONE.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.312
BUT IF I DO IT, THEN HE
HOOKS ME UP WITH REAL FOOD,

16:52.345 --> 16:55.182
NOT JUST THE GARBAGE.
GREAT FRIEND.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.184
THESE FRAGMENTS COULD HAVE
PERFORATED YOUR COLON

16:57.217 --> 16:57.984
AND KILLED YOU.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.619
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE US
YOU'LL STOP.

16:59.652 --> 17:03.190
I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY EYES.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.225
WHAT IS IT?

17:05.258 --> 17:08.027
UH, IT'S LIKE I'M LOOKING AT YOU
FROM THE BOTTOM OF A WELL.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.705
[toy helicopter whirring]

17:18.738 --> 17:21.441
(Masters)
IF WE ADD TUNNEL VISION
TO THE DYSOSMIA,

17:21.474 --> 17:24.844
WE CAN SUBTRACT THE BONE-INDUCED
ABDOMINAL BLEEDING.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.081
(Taub)
I THOUGHT THE DYSOSMIA
WAS FROM HEROIN.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.617
(Masters)
HE SAID HE NEVER SNORTED.
HE JUST SHOT UP.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.452
SO THAT WOULDN'T HAVE AFFECTED
HIS SENSE OF SMELL.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.822
AND WE BELIEVE
THE LYING LIAR WHY?

17:35.855 --> 17:36.523
HOUSE...

17:36.556 --> 17:39.592
ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO US?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.861
I'LL START WHEN YOU DECIDE
WHAT THE SYMPTOMS ARE

17:41.894 --> 17:43.230
AND GIVE ME SOME THEORIES.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.198
IF WE COMBINE
THE DYSOSMIA

17:45.232 --> 17:47.500
WITH THE TUNNEL VISION,

17:47.534 --> 17:51.171
THE SYMPTOMS FIT
FOR WESTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.873
BUT THE PATIENT DOESN'T--
NO FEVER.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.776
OW!
WHAT THE HELL?

17:56.809 --> 17:58.878
NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.713
WHAT ABOUT
FOSTER KENNEDY SYNDROME?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.815
HE COULD HAVE A MENINGIOMA
OR PLASMACYTOMA.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.751
STARTED BY PRESSING
ON HIS OLFACTORY NERVES,

18:04.784 --> 18:06.519
IT AFFECTS HIS SENSE
OF SMELL,

18:06.553 --> 18:09.522
AND NOW IT'S GROWING AND
PRESSING ON HIS OPTIC NERVE.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.159
GOOD.
MRI HIS HEAD, FIND IT.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.494
(Cuddy)
YOUR POTENTIAL DONATION...

18:14.527 --> 18:18.798
HEY, HEY.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.168
...HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT
ON OUR COMMUNITY.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.370
WE COULD EXTEND THE HOURS--

18:26.506 --> 18:28.741
SOMETHING WRONG?
NO.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.743
I JUST THINK MAYBE IT WOULD BE
A BETTER IDEA TO HAVE A TOUR

18:30.777 --> 18:32.179
OF THE CLINIC FIRST.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.247
IT'S RIGHT THIS WAY.
OH--

18:37.250 --> 18:39.686
OH!
OH!

18:43.890 --> 18:45.825
UH...

18:45.858 --> 18:49.796
WE HAVE SEVERAL PATIENTS
THAT ARE CHILDREN,

18:49.829 --> 18:51.931
AND WE FIND
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

18:51.964 --> 18:52.932
TO GIVE THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY

18:52.965 --> 18:57.870
TO MAKE THE HOSPITAL
A LESS INTIMIDATING PLACE.

18:57.904 --> 19:02.642
M-MY DAD USED TO LOCK ME
IN A CLOSET,

19:02.675 --> 19:04.844
AND IT--AND IT FEELS
LIKE I CAN'T BREATHE.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.947
WE NEED YOU TO STAY STILL.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.749
GIVE HIM A BREAK.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.684
YOU WANT HIM
SQUIRMING AROUND?

19:11.718 --> 19:12.552
WE'LL HAVE TO DO IT TWICE.

19:12.585 --> 19:15.222
I WANT YOU TO SHOW HIM
A LITTLE RESPECT.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.791
YOU REALLY THINK THIS KID
CAN TURN HIS LIFE AROUND?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.628
HE BELIEVES GOD GAVE HIM
A SECOND CHANCE.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.962
THAT KIND OF BELIEF
CAN BE POWERFUL.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.798
MASTERS
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.667
HE PLAYS THE FELLOW
MED STUDENT

19:27.700 --> 19:29.802
WHO DREAMS OF BEING A DOCTOR
AND REELS HER IN.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.206
BUT YOU FALLING FOR HIS
DEEP CONNECTION WITH GOD?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.641
HE HAS HOPE.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.842
AFTER ALL HE'S BEEN THROUGH,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.810
IT KIND OF MAKES ME
ROOT FOR HIM.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.911
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO HE IS,

19:38.945 --> 19:41.514
EXCEPT THAT HE LIES
ABOUT WHO HE IS.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.717
THE BIT ABOUT HIS ABUSIVE FATHER
IS PROBABLY ALL MADE UP.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.786
AND HE FAKED
THE SCARS?

19:46.819 --> 19:48.788
HE'S A PUNK. PROBABLY GOT
INTO A LOT OF FIGHTS.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.959
AND HE SUCKED YOU IN
USING THE DAD STORY.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.727
I DON'T THINK
I'M FEELING VERY WELL.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.764
I THINK I'M--

19:57.797 --> 19:59.666
HE'S VOMITING.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.702
SHOULD I ASK HIM TO STAY STILL
WHILE HE DOES THAT?

20:05.372 --> 20:07.607
HE HAS TWO DARK SPOTS
IN THE PARIETAL CORTEX.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.675
THEY'RE NOT TUMORS--

20:08.708 --> 20:12.645
MAYBE SOME KIND OF, UH, INJURY
OR INBORN DEFECT.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.514
APPARENTLY HE WAS
CLINICALLY DEAD

20:14.547 --> 20:16.249
FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
WHEN HE O.D.'D.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.950
THE DARK SPOTS
COULD BE BRAIN DAMAGE

20:17.984 --> 20:20.620
FROM OXYGEN STARVATION.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.788
EXCEPT IT'S NOT.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.724
I'VE SEEN MRI IMAGERY
LIKE THAT IN SCHIZOPHRENICS.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.793
THREE SERVING TWO.
BUT SCHIZOPHRENIA
DOESN'T EXPLAIN

20:26.826 --> 20:28.795
WHY HIS BLOOD PRESSURE
SKYROCKETED,

20:28.828 --> 20:29.962
AND HE THREW UP
IN THE MRI.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.764
PANIC ATTACK.
HE'S CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.266
HE WAS FINE
ONCE WE LET HIM OUT.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.934
(Foreman)
THE DYSOSMIA AND TUNNEL VISION

20:34.967 --> 20:35.968
COULD BE HALLUCINATIONS.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.904
EXCEPT, AS WAS
ALREADY COVERED,

20:37.937 --> 20:42.275
HE WAS SCREENED FOR
MENTAL ILLNESS DOWN IN THE E.R.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.443
IN YOUR HEAD!

20:43.476 --> 20:45.812
IT'S "FACE."
ON YOUR FACE!

20:45.845 --> 20:47.847
CLOSE ENOUGH.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.915
THE E.R. DOCS MISSED IT,

20:48.948 --> 20:50.983
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T PRESENT
WITH MAJOR SYMPTOMS YET.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.485
WE'RE SEEING IT
IN ITS INFANCY.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.986
SO WE TREAT HIM,
AND THEN WHAT?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.891
HE BECOMES JUST ANOTHER
SCHIZOPHRENIC HOMELESS MAN

20:58.925 --> 21:00.893
WANDERING THE STREETS--
WE HAVE TO HELP HIM.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.296
I'D LOVE TO, BUT I GOT
FOUR MILLION OTHER CRAZY PEOPLE

21:03.330 --> 21:04.831
AHEAD OF HIM
ON MY TO-DO LIST,

21:04.864 --> 21:08.301
ALONG WITH MILK.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.974
[door opens]

21:15.007 --> 21:16.843
YOU TWO SPENT MONTHS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

21:16.876 --> 21:17.877
A WAY TO DATE
AND NOT HAVE IT AFFECT

21:17.910 --> 21:19.412
YOUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.914
NOW YOU NEED TO DO
THE SAME THING FOR NOT DATING.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.353
NO, I DON'T.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.388
THIS IS SERIOUS.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.690
DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHE'S--

21:30.723 --> 21:34.861
SHE'S DYING OF GUILT AND FEELS
HORRIBLE FOR DUMPING ME.

21:34.894 --> 21:35.628
IT'S GREAT.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.097
I MEAN,
NOT THE DUMPING PART,

21:38.130 --> 21:39.832
BUT THE PART WHERE
SHE'LL NOW

21:39.866 --> 21:42.001
LET ME DO
WHATEVER I WANT.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.637
SO YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO PUNISH HER?

21:44.671 --> 21:46.939
SHE FEELS BAD,
AND YOUR ONLY GOAL

21:46.973 --> 21:48.575
IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.910
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.045
I GOT PLENTY OF GOALS.

21:53.079 --> 21:56.483
ONE OF THEM IS A 60-INCH
FLAT SCREEN RIGHT THERE.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.654
YOU'RE A LOT OF THINGS, HOUSE,
BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN A SADIST.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.490
YOU'RE PUMMELING

22:03.523 --> 22:06.693
AN OPPONENT
WHO ISN'T FIGHTING BACK.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.968
I ALREADY GAVE HIM
A SECOND DOSE OF CLOZAPINE.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.406
YOU DON'T NEED--
I'LL BET YOU 50 BUCKS
HIS FAVORITE SPORT IS HOCKEY.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.940
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
KNOW THAT?

22:20.973 --> 22:22.609
JUST A HUNCH.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.944
HOW YOU FEELING?

22:24.977 --> 22:26.413
MY ARM KIND OF HURTS.

22:26.446 --> 22:30.383
I'LL TALK TO THE NURSE
ABOUT UPPING YOUR PAIN MEDS.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.786
HOCKEY, EH?
[chuckles]

22:33.820 --> 22:36.556
OH, MY NEPHEW
BOUGHT IT FOR ME--

22:36.589 --> 22:38.958
KNOWS I'M A HUGE FAN.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.063
I HATE HOCKEY.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.971
IF THIS IS SCHIZOPHRENIA,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED REGULAR CARE.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.973
I FOUND SOME SHELTERS
THAT HAVE

22:54.006 --> 22:55.642
FULL-TIME MEDICAL STAFF
AND ALSO--

22:55.675 --> 22:57.410
OH, MY ARM REALLY HURTS!

22:57.444 --> 22:59.178
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
OW...

22:59.211 --> 23:01.714
IT FEELS LIKE IT'S ON FIRE!
WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK
UNDER THE BANDAGES.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.916
OW! NO, NO, NO.
NOT THAT ONE, THIS ONE!

23:14.861 --> 23:18.498
AHOY THERE, ME HEARTIES!
PERMISSION TO COME ABOARD.

23:18.531 --> 23:21.133
[rock music]

23:21.167 --> 23:25.538
*

23:25.572 --> 23:32.779
[engine revving]
*

23:32.812 --> 23:36.182
DANNY SAID HIS LEFT ARM
FELT LIKE IT WAS

23:36.215 --> 23:37.750
ON FIRE LAST NIGHT.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.219
WE ASSUMED IT WAS
A SCHIZOPHRENIC DELUSION, BUT--

23:40.252 --> 23:42.655
IT'S NOT.
HE'S ON CLOZAPINE.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.123
HE'D BE GETTING BETTER,
NOT WORSE.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.826
SOUNDS LIKE
REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.127
HAS TO BE
A GENETIC DISORDER.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.161
[horn honks, tires screech]

23:49.195 --> 23:51.798
WOULD YOU SLOW DOWN!
YOU'RE GONNA GET US ARRESTED.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.666
(Taub)
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.702
WE'LL PROBABLY DIE FIRST.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.136
DON'T MAKE ME
TAKE MY SHOE OFF!

23:57.169 --> 23:58.805
WE NEED TO RUN
HIS DNA.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.907
HE COULD HAVE EARLY ONSET
OF PARKINSON'S.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.743
OR CORTICAL-BASED
GANGLIONIC DEGENERATION

24:03.776 --> 24:05.578
OR HUNTINGTON'S OR ANY ONE
OF A DOZEN OTHER

24:05.612 --> 24:07.046
GENETIC DISEASES.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.181
HEY, IF YOU LET US OUT,
WE CAN START TESTING.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.684
IF WE'RE GONNA TEST
FOR THEM ALL, IT'LL TAKE WEEKS.

24:11.718 --> 24:14.621
I'M NOT CANCELING MY HONEYMOON
TO TREAT THIS KID.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.923
IT'S A FAKE MARRIAGE,
BUT A REAL HONEYMOON?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.257
MOST ARE.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.391
DANNY COULD ALSO DIE

24:19.425 --> 24:21.628
BEFORE WE GET THROUGH TESTING
FOR ALL THE POSSIBILITIES.

24:21.661 --> 24:22.662
SO WE CHEAT.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.932
SINCE IT'S GENETIC,
DADDY OR MOMMY'S GOT IT TOO.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.567
THEY'RE EITHER SICK OR DEAD.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.968
(Masters)
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE HIS MOTHER IS,

24:29.001 --> 24:30.803
AND HE WON'T TELL US
WHERE HIS FATHER IS.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.809
HE'S A HOMELESS
EX-JUNKIE.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.978
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU FOUR GENIUSES

24:39.011 --> 24:41.648
CAN'T OUTWIT HIM?

24:41.681 --> 24:43.215
GREEN LIGHT!

24:43.249 --> 24:46.619
[engine revving]

24:46.653 --> 24:48.755
[door opens]

24:51.558 --> 24:52.892
CUDDY GOT IT FOR ME.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.894
AND NOW I'M DRAFTING
A REQUEST

24:54.927 --> 24:56.796
FOR A STUDY
INTO THE EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE

24:56.829 --> 24:58.197
INVOLVING AN ITALIAN
ESPRESSO MACHINE

24:58.230 --> 25:00.700
AND A MASSAGE CHAIR,
SO MAKE IT QUICK.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.636
I FOUND DANNY'S FATHER.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.671
WELL DONE.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.773
THE KID SAID HE WAS
IN A STATE-SPONSORED REHAB

25:06.806 --> 25:07.907
LAST NOVEMBER.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.809
THERE'S ONLY ONE
DANNY JENNINGS

25:09.842 --> 25:11.844
THAT WAS IN TREATMENT
AT THE TIME,

25:11.878 --> 25:13.546
AND HE LISTED
HIS FATHER'S ADDRESS

25:13.580 --> 25:16.215
AS HIS PRIMARY
NEXT OF KIN.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.317
THE "WELL DONE"
WAS FOR MAKING IT QUICK.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.886
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE THAT BACK.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.254
HE LIVES ABOUT 30 MINUTES
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.023
AND THE REASON
YOU'RE CONTINUING TO TALK

25:24.056 --> 25:25.692
INSTEAD OF DRIVING THERE?

25:25.725 --> 25:28.861
CHASE AND MASTERS
ARE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY.

25:34.934 --> 25:38.871
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME
TO BE PART OF YOUR WEDDING?

25:38.905 --> 25:41.908
YOU ARE GENUINELY UPSET
AT BEING MOCKINGLY SNUBBED

25:41.941 --> 25:43.042
BY A MOCK WEDDING?

25:43.075 --> 25:45.812
IS IT BECAUSE
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE

25:45.845 --> 25:47.046
AS LONG AS THEM?

25:47.079 --> 25:51.083
OR IS IT THAT YOU
REALLY DON'T LIKE ME?

25:51.117 --> 25:53.886
OR ARE--
ARE YOU JUST S-SCREWING--

25:53.920 --> 25:56.923
UM...

26:01.861 --> 26:04.063
I'LL...

26:04.096 --> 26:08.635
I'LL COME BACK
WHEN SHE'S FINISHED.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.970
SHE IS.

26:13.339 --> 26:14.774
OH, MY GOD!

26:14.807 --> 26:17.309
W-WHAT DID YOU THINK
SHE WAS DOING?

26:17.343 --> 26:20.246
SHE'S JUST INSTALLING
THE CABLE.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.282
THAT'S NOT A EUPHEMISM!

26:23.315 --> 26:26.786
OH, I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE LITTLE ONE.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.922
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO?

26:33.926 --> 26:35.127
[knocking on door]

26:39.999 --> 26:40.967
CAN I HELP YOU?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.703
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR SON DANNY.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.905
DANNY?
WHO ARE YOU?

26:45.938 --> 26:47.807
WE'RE HIS DOCTORS.
WE NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.776
OR PERHAPS HIS MOTHER,
HAVE ANY FAMILY HISTORY

26:49.809 --> 26:50.609
OF GENETIC DISEASE.

26:50.643 --> 26:53.713
WHY? WHAT DIFFERENCE
WOULD IT MAKE?

26:53.746 --> 26:55.181
[scoffs]

26:55.214 --> 26:57.183
YOU MAY NOT CARE
ABOUT YOUR SON, BUT--

26:57.216 --> 26:58.651
IS THAT WHAT DANNY
TOLD YOU

26:58.685 --> 27:01.120
WHEN HE WAS IN REHAB--
WE DIDN'T LOVE HIM?

27:01.153 --> 27:03.189
UM, NOT WHY WE CAME HERE.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.891
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW

27:04.924 --> 27:07.894
IF THERE'S ANY DIAGNOSED
GENETIC DISEASE IN YOUR FAMILY.

27:07.927 --> 27:08.828
WE'RE TRYING

27:08.861 --> 27:10.196
TO MAKE
YOUR SON BETTER.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.899
BETTER?

27:12.932 --> 27:14.867
HE DIED OF A DRUG OVERDOSE.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.836
WE BURIED HIM
THREE MONTHS AGO.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.889
WHO ARE YOU?

27:36.923 --> 27:39.358
SHH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:39.391 --> 27:40.793
A TEST.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.796
WHO ARE YOU?

27:43.830 --> 27:47.466
THE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS,
WHO ARE YOU?

27:47.499 --> 27:50.870
DANNY JENNINGS IS DEAD,

27:50.903 --> 27:53.806
WHICH MEANS THAT
DANNY JENNINGS HAS NO PULSE.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.776
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND...

27:56.809 --> 27:58.077
DO.

27:58.110 --> 28:02.181
ERGO, YOU ARE NOT
DANNY JENNINGS.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.884
OR I DID THE TEST WRONG.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.152
SO WHY DON'T YOU CUT
THE CRAP

28:06.185 --> 28:09.021
AND TELL ME
YOUR REAL NAME.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.890
NO.

28:10.923 --> 28:14.260
HIDING YOUR IDENTITY--

28:14.293 --> 28:16.963
WELL, EITHER YOU'RE A CRIMINAL
OR A SUPERHERO.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.899
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.201
AWESOME.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.837
WHAT COLOR
IS MY UNDERWEAR?

28:24.871 --> 28:27.740
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
MY NAME.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.511
NO PROBLEM.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.380
I JUST NEED
YOUR FATHER'S NAME.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.885
FORGET IT.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.287
CARE TO TELL ME WHY?

28:44.891 --> 28:47.226
HE'S LOOKING FOR ME.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.798
HE SUPPOSEDLY...

28:51.831 --> 28:55.167
CLEANED UP
AND GOT SOBER.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.870
AND NOW HE--

28:57.904 --> 29:00.372
HE WANTS TO BE A PART
OF MY LIFE AGAIN.

29:00.406 --> 29:04.043
AND I CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.779
YOU'RE A BIG BOY NOW.

29:06.813 --> 29:09.748
YOU STILL THINK
HE CAN HURT YOU?

29:11.851 --> 29:14.120
YOU DON'T GET IT.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.990
IF I EVER SEE
MY DAD AGAIN...

29:21.060 --> 29:24.296
I'LL KILL HIM.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.211
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

29:41.848 --> 29:43.115
WELL, LUCKILY FOR YOU,

29:43.149 --> 29:46.919
WE DON'T NEED DADDY
TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.894
DID YOU FIND OUT
HIS REAL NAME?

29:54.927 --> 29:57.196
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.065
THAT'S A WEIRD NAME.

29:59.098 --> 30:02.001
THE GUY WHIFFED TWICE
TRYING TO PICK UP A CUP

30:02.034 --> 30:03.102
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.938
THAT PLUS
EVERYTHING ELSE...

30:10.309 --> 30:14.947
MEANS THAT WE HAVE WHITTLED
OUR LIST OF GENETIC DISEASES...

30:14.981 --> 30:18.417
ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO ONE--

30:18.450 --> 30:21.888
EARLY-ONSET PARKINSON'S.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.890
AFTER EVERYTHING
HE'S BEEN THROUGH,

30:23.923 --> 30:25.057
NOW WE HAVE TO TELL HIM,

30:25.091 --> 30:28.460
"HEY, YOU HAVE
AN INCURABLE DISEASE

30:28.494 --> 30:30.897
THAT GETS
PROGRESSIVELY WORSE."

30:30.930 --> 30:33.866
YOU COULD LIE.
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.868
BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY
BOTH FEEL BETTER

30:35.902 --> 30:39.005
IF YOU GIVE HIM LEVODOPA
AND CONFIRM WITH DNA TESTS.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.648
HE'S GONE TOO FAR.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.084
HE'S TAKING UP
SIX HANDICAPPED SPACES

30:52.118 --> 30:53.652
WITH A MONSTER TRUCK.
IT'S ONLY FOUR,

30:53.685 --> 30:55.454
AND HE'S GONNA GET RID OF IT
AFTER THE WEDDING.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.389
AND THE CHAPEL--
HE'S TURNED THE CHAPEL

30:57.423 --> 30:58.891
INTO HIS OWN PERSONAL
CATERING HALL.

30:58.925 --> 30:59.858
WHO CARES?

30:59.892 --> 31:01.894
OTHER THAN A JANITOR
SLEEPING OFF A BENDER,

31:01.928 --> 31:03.963
HE'S THE FIRST PERSON
TO USE IT IN TWO WEEKS.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.966
APPEASEMENT IS NEVER
THE ANSWER

31:06.999 --> 31:08.134
IN THE FACE
OF NAKED AGGRESSION.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.302
IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE HIS TANKS

31:10.336 --> 31:13.372
ARE ROLLING DOWN
YOUR CHAMPS-ELYSEES.

31:13.405 --> 31:17.576
I KNOW WHAT HOUSE IS DOING.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.445
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND--
WHY DO YOU CARE?

31:19.478 --> 31:21.047
HE ISN'T HURTING ANYONE.

31:29.555 --> 31:32.691
YOU'RE THE FIRST BOSS
HE'S EVER HAD

31:32.724 --> 31:34.660
WHO COULD HANDLE HIM.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.963
BEFORE YOU,
HE WAS EITHER FIRED

31:36.996 --> 31:39.231
OR BURIED UNDER A MOUNTAIN
OF MALPRACTICE SUITS.

31:39.265 --> 31:43.469
HE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO SAY NO.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.704
HE NEEDS SOMEONE
HE'LL LISTEN TO

31:45.737 --> 31:48.307
WHEN THEY SAY NO.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.976
IF YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT HOUSE,

31:50.009 --> 31:51.677
YOU'LL STOP FEELING
SORRY FOR HIM

31:51.710 --> 31:54.380
AND GET OUT THERE
AND START KICKING HIM

31:54.413 --> 31:57.083
WHERE HE NEEDS KICKING.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.524
I CHANGED MY MIND.

32:05.557 --> 32:08.027
WHAT, YOU WANT THE FISH
INSTEAD OF THE CHICKEN?

32:08.060 --> 32:09.962
THIS ROOM IS
FOR PATIENTS' FAMILIES,

32:09.996 --> 32:12.031
NOT FOR DOCTORS TRYING
TO DEFRAUD THE GOVERNMENT.

32:12.064 --> 32:15.401
OH, SO...

32:15.434 --> 32:17.403
YOU'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE A MORAL STAND.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.704
YEAH.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.739
THE CHAPEL STILL HAS SANCTITY
FOR SOME PEOPLE.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.008
YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.275
I THINK I SAW
BLUE THE JANITOR

32:23.309 --> 32:25.311
PASSED OUT IN ONE
OF THE PEWS LAST WEEK.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.147
IT'S "LOU," AND I WOULD HAVE
THROWN HIM OUT TOO.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.717
WELL, WHERE ARE WE
GONNA GO?

32:31.750 --> 32:34.253
WE GOT CATERERS STAGING
EVERYTHING DOWNSTAIRS

32:34.286 --> 32:35.621
AS WE SPEAK.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.756
WE'VE GOT FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS,
PLACE SETTINGS...

32:37.789 --> 32:39.992
OTHER WEDDING-Y STUFF.

32:40.026 --> 32:42.461
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

32:42.494 --> 32:46.098
I SENT OUT
THE INVITATIONS.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.633
PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE.

32:47.666 --> 32:52.004
THAT'S ALSO NOT MY PROBLEM.

32:56.442 --> 33:00.412
(Cuddy)
AND I WANT THE TV BACK.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.223
YOU SHOULD JUST
LET ME DIE.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.328
THE WORLD'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT ME.

IT'S NORMAL.

33:21.267 --> 33:25.404
PEOPLE FEEL DEPRESSED
WHEN THEY GET BAD NEWS...

33:25.437 --> 33:27.606
BECAUSE IT'S BAD NEWS...

33:30.476 --> 33:32.244
OBVIOUSLY.

33:33.779 --> 33:37.749
I DIDN'T O.D.
BY ACCIDENT.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.751
I WAS TRYING
TO KILL MYSELF.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.423
WHY?

33:49.495 --> 33:53.099
'CAUSE I'VE DONE THINGS...

33:53.132 --> 33:56.668
HORRIBLE THINGS.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.704
I'VE HURT PEOPLE.

33:58.737 --> 34:02.408
AND WHEN I DIDN'T DIE,

34:02.441 --> 34:03.675
I THOUGHT...

34:03.709 --> 34:06.778
[chuckles tearfully]

34:06.812 --> 34:09.615
I THOUGHT GOD FORGAVE ME.

TO SUFFER.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.723

YOU DON'T DESERVE IT.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.769
I...

34:30.802 --> 34:35.441
I HAD A GIRLFRIEND
IN COLLEGE...

34:35.474 --> 34:39.411
AND I ALMOST KILLED HER.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.748
I JUST SNAPPED.

34:45.484 --> 34:49.255
AND I STARTED HITTING HER.

34:49.288 --> 34:52.458

HADN'T COME HOME...

34:57.763 --> 35:01.800
I'M EVIL.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.903
I AM JUST LIKE MY DAD.

35:04.936 --> 35:09.741
WE'RE BOTH MONSTERS.
I DESERVE TO DIE.

35:17.783 --> 35:21.753
I CAN'T--I CAN'T--

35:38.904 --> 35:40.939
HIS HEART IS DILATED
AND FAILING.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.542
AND AT THE RATE IT'S HAPPENING,
HE'LL NEED A NEW ONE SOON.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.812
AND THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL GET HIM
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.747
WHAT ARE WE MISSING?

35:48.780 --> 35:51.250
EVERYTHING. WE KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS KID.

35:51.283 --> 35:54.920
EXCEPT THAT HE'S GOTTEN WORSE
SINCE WE ADMITTED HIM.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.555
WHY?

35:56.588 --> 35:58.790
MOST OF OUR PATIENTS
TEND TO DO THAT,

35:58.824 --> 36:00.192
UNLESS WE CURE THEM.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.828
YEAH, BUT WHY
SO FAST?

36:02.861 --> 36:04.563
HE HAD DYSOSMIA
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS,

36:04.596 --> 36:05.931
NEVER EVEN CAME HERE
TO GET IT TREATED.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.934
HE'S JUST
A RANDOM BURN VICTIM.

THAN, SAY, LIVING

36:20.779 --> 36:22.848
IN A FILTHY STATE PARK?

36:22.881 --> 36:25.217
YOU THINK CLEANLINESS
IS MAKING HIM SICK?

36:27.253 --> 36:29.321
WE TREATED HIM
WITH VICODIN, CLOZAPINE,

36:29.355 --> 36:30.922
AND ONE I.V. BAG
OF LEVODOPA.

36:30.956 --> 36:34.960

HIS CONDITION STARTED
DETERIORATING BEFORE THAT.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.400
IT'S HIS HEALTHY DIET
OF GREEN VEGETABLES

37:14.433 --> 37:15.667
THAT'S KILLING HIM.

WE SAVE HIS LIFE.
