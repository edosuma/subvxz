<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.926 --> 00:07.461
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.897
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.965 --> 00:12.586
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.654 --> 00:14.874
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.942 --> 00:17.067
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.135 --> 00:20.317
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:20.385 --> 00:22.952
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:23.020 --> 00:24.560
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.627 --> 00:26.196
Should we shoot them?

00:26.264 --> 00:28.767
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.835 --> 00:31.177
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.718
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.786 --> 00:35.890
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.958 --> 00:38.394
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.462 --> 00:40.065
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:50.005 --> 00:51.945
<i>In the world of intelligence,</i>

00:51.946 --> 00:54.280
<i>taking down</i>
<i>an entire covert network</i>

00:54.348 --> 00:56.249
<i>is the ultimate challenge.</i>

00:56.318 --> 00:58.620
<i>It's not something</i>
<i>you can do alone.</i>

00:58.687 --> 01:00.321
- You.
- Welcome back.

01:00.388 --> 01:02.956
<i>You need the resources of</i>
<i>an entire intelligence agency</i>

01:03.024 --> 01:04.191
<i>behind you.</i>

01:04.257 --> 01:05.759
<i>You need solid intelligence</i>

01:05.827 --> 01:07.962
<i>that can point you</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

01:08.030 --> 01:09.196
That list is the key

01:09.264 --> 01:10.798
to destroying the people
who burned me.

01:10.866 --> 01:13.933
<i>But that's just</i>
<i>a starting point.</i>

01:14.001 --> 01:15.768
<i>You're not after</i>
<i>an individual person --</i>

01:15.836 --> 01:18.937
<i>you're after dozens of people,</i>
<i>all of them hiding,</i>

01:19.005 --> 01:21.105
<i>all of them</i>
<i>with resources and skills,</i>

01:21.173 --> 01:24.241
<i>all of them fighting you</i>
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

01:24.310 --> 01:27.212
<i>It's a gigantic jigsaw puzzle</i>
<i>of information</i>

01:27.279 --> 01:29.449
<i>that requires months</i>
<i>of research and analysis</i>

01:29.517 --> 01:31.084
<i>where one target</i>
<i>leads to the next.</i>

01:31.152 --> 01:34.788
<i>A courier picked up</i>
<i>off the suburban street</i>

01:34.856 --> 01:38.627
<i>leads to a spy hiding out as</i>
<i>a diplomat in a foreign embassy</i>

01:38.695 --> 01:40.295
<i>leads to a hardened group</i>
<i>of armed assassins</i>

01:40.363 --> 01:42.698
<i>in another place entirely.</i>

01:42.766 --> 01:46.068
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>it's a surgical operation</i>

01:46.136 --> 01:48.070
<i>done with discrete teams</i>
<i>that no one ever hears about.</i>

01:48.839 --> 01:50.506
<i>Other times, it's all-out war.</i>

01:54.143 --> 01:56.111
<i>But one thing</i>
<i>is always the same --</i>

01:56.178 --> 01:57.679
<i>with each piece of the puzzle,</i>

01:57.746 --> 02:00.014
<i>you find you understand</i>
<i>your enemy more clearly.</i>

02:01.783 --> 02:03.484
<i>You penetrate the secrecy</i>

02:03.551 --> 02:04.551
<i>that shields the people</i>
<i>behind the scenes...</i>

02:06.387 --> 02:08.389
<i>...Working your way</i>
<i>to the top of the network</i>

02:08.457 --> 02:09.691
<i>to the people</i>
<i>pulling the strings.</i>

02:11.260 --> 02:12.994
<i>You keep fighting,</i>

02:13.062 --> 02:15.465
<i>trying to put that last</i>
<i>piece of the puzzle in place...</i>

02:17.902 --> 02:20.337
<i>...Trying to find</i>
<i>that last person</i>

02:20.405 --> 02:23.040
<i>who will give you the answers</i>
<i>you're looking for.</i>

02:41.230 --> 02:42.530
Glad you made it.

02:42.598 --> 02:45.099
I was beginning to wish
I'd brought a magazine.

02:45.167 --> 02:47.535
There was a guard change
at the front entrance.

02:47.603 --> 02:48.903
Isn't knowing that

02:48.971 --> 02:51.038
supposed to be <i>your</i> job
as senior field officer?

02:53.343 --> 02:56.311
Handling that kind of your job as an
operative extraordinaire?

02:56.379 --> 02:57.813
Oh, but that's not
my title.

02:57.881 --> 03:00.417
Until my burn notice
is officially lifted,

03:00.484 --> 03:02.786
I'm just a "civilian
intelligence asset."

03:05.089 --> 03:07.223
Just saying, the way
the boss talks about you,

03:07.291 --> 03:11.128
I'd think handling
a few government security guards

03:11.195 --> 03:12.863
would be
a piece of cake.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.032
I think
he's got a crush on you.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.634
I can hear you guys,
you know.

03:16.702 --> 03:18.202
Your mikes are live.

03:20.038 --> 03:22.539
Just busting your chops,
boss.

03:22.607 --> 03:24.074
I'm here
with your favorite toy.

03:24.142 --> 03:25.976
I get jealous sometimes.

03:26.044 --> 03:27.945
We're supposed to be wheels up
at the airport in an hour.

03:28.013 --> 03:30.147
Stop screwing around
and get in there.

03:30.215 --> 03:31.148
Roger that.

03:31.216 --> 03:33.317
He sounds grumpy.

03:33.385 --> 03:36.388
You'd be grumpy, too, if you had
a beard that looked that bad.

03:36.455 --> 03:37.990
You want to do the honors,
superstar?

03:38.057 --> 03:41.660
<i>RFID security</i>
<i>is easy to get around</i>

03:41.728 --> 03:43.997
<i>with a device known</i>
<i>in the trade as a "gecko."</i>

03:44.064 --> 03:47.334
<i>Complicated electronics,</i>
<i>but a simple principle --</i>

03:47.401 --> 03:51.071
<i>any key can be copied,</i>
<i>even a digital one.</i>

03:59.649 --> 04:01.249
Hey, I'll be
out of here in a sec.

04:01.317 --> 04:03.152
Just finishing up
a software update.

04:03.219 --> 04:05.187
You know, nowadays,
those updates are done remotely.

04:05.255 --> 04:07.055
You don't have to hard-line
into the mainframe.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.191
Unless, of course,
you're trying to steal data.

04:09.259 --> 04:12.461
Game's over, Hector.
You're coming with us.

04:12.529 --> 04:13.729
Listen,
this is some sort of mistake.

04:13.797 --> 04:15.464
Come on, Hector.
We can do this the easy way

04:15.532 --> 04:17.099
or the way
that involves an ambulance.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.500
My name is <i>Tim,</i> all right?
Not Hector.

04:18.567 --> 04:19.902
Tim Sayers?

04:19.969 --> 04:22.437
No. That's the name
on the I.T. badge you stole.

04:22.505 --> 04:23.705
You're Hector Oaks.

04:23.773 --> 04:25.206
I guess after you bombed
the embassy in Albania,

04:25.274 --> 04:27.676
you lost the glasses
and bleached your hair.

04:27.744 --> 04:29.343
It's working for him.
I like it. Yeah.

04:29.411 --> 04:31.712
Me too.
Guys, seriously -- some sort of mistake.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.881
I'll prove it to you.
I've got my license right here.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.654
They never choose
the easy way.

04:47.695 --> 04:48.929
Hello, security?

04:48.996 --> 04:50.664
Yes, there's a man down
on the 9th floor.

04:50.732 --> 04:52.700
He's hurt,
and I think he's unconscious.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.034
Let's move, fellas.

04:54.102 --> 04:56.637
We'll meet you
at the northwest service exit.

04:56.704 --> 04:59.172
We got to hustle before
a real ambulance shows up.

05:12.821 --> 05:14.788
Let's move!

05:14.856 --> 05:16.624
Plane ticket,
one-off I.D.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.625
You head home
at 2200 hours.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.028
Really good
to have you back.

05:21.096 --> 05:22.663
No, I want in on this.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.331
You know as well as I do

05:24.399 --> 05:25.599
this isn't just
another interrogation.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.835
Slow down.
Let us question him --

05:27.903 --> 05:29.069
he could know where
the operations chief is.

05:29.137 --> 05:30.170
And if he does --

05:30.238 --> 05:31.905
Hey! We'll keep you
in the loop.

05:31.973 --> 05:33.073
Make sure you do.

05:33.141 --> 05:35.342
I've waited
a long time for this.

05:35.410 --> 05:38.279
- I know, Michael. You want answers.
- No, Raines.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.482
I <i>need</i> answers.

<i>One of the most dangerous times</i>
<i>for a spy</i>

05:50.922 --> 05:52.512
<i>is right after a job.</i>

05:52.513 --> 05:54.113
<i>Your guard is down,</i>

05:54.181 --> 05:56.482
<i>which makes it a good time</i>

05:56.549 --> 05:59.652

05:59.720 --> 06:00.954
<i>Your friends.</i>

06:01.021 --> 06:02.622
Fiona. Uh, Fiona.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.524
Fiona, don't you think

06:04.592 --> 06:07.493
we'd be more comfortable
on the bed?

06:07.561 --> 06:09.195
What makes you think...

06:09.263 --> 06:11.664
That I care...

06:11.732 --> 06:13.065
If you're comfortable?

06:32.453 --> 06:33.954
How was the job?

06:34.021 --> 06:35.555
The job was good.

06:35.623 --> 06:36.956
I missed you.

06:37.024 --> 06:38.658
Yeah, I...got that.

06:38.726 --> 06:40.493
I think you broke a rib.

06:43.865 --> 06:45.499
So where were you
this time?

06:47.201 --> 06:48.401
Fi...

06:50.170 --> 06:51.204
Right.

06:51.271 --> 06:55.107
Right, right, right.
You can't say.

06:55.175 --> 06:58.678
Secret spy stuff.

06:58.746 --> 07:01.414
Don't you find it
somewhat ironic

07:01.481 --> 07:02.848
that for years,

07:02.916 --> 07:06.586
we've been dealing
with this little conspiracy?

07:06.653 --> 07:08.488
I think a memo called it

07:08.556 --> 07:11.491
an "Unauthorized
quasi-governmental agency."

07:13.628 --> 07:15.796
My point is,

07:15.864 --> 07:19.066
we fought the people who burned
you for a long time, Michael.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.501
Now they're on the run,

07:20.568 --> 07:23.570
the CIA
hunting the bastards down,

07:23.638 --> 07:25.372
and we're just out.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.609
I wish I could tell you, Fi.
I really do.

07:28.676 --> 07:31.379
It's been six months now.

07:31.446 --> 07:35.116
Mysterious trips
around the world with Max.

07:35.184 --> 07:36.818
It just doesn't seem fair

07:36.885 --> 07:39.354
that he should
get to have all the fun.

07:39.421 --> 07:41.189
I mean, he's, what,
your keeper or whatever?

07:41.256 --> 07:45.059
He's my agency contact.
It had to be someone, Fi.

07:45.127 --> 07:47.361
The CIA wasn't just gonna
let me got out there alone.

07:55.570 --> 07:58.872
When you got burned...

07:58.940 --> 08:01.742
It wasn't just you.

08:01.810 --> 08:06.046
These last four years
have been hard on all of us.

08:06.114 --> 08:07.081
I know.

08:09.017 --> 08:13.253
I know, and I'm really sorry
about that.

08:13.321 --> 08:17.891
But we are so close
to wrapping this up.

08:17.958 --> 08:20.760
And then I can move on.

08:20.828 --> 08:23.363
I hope you find what
you're looking for, Michael.

08:23.431 --> 08:27.033
I really do.

08:27.101 --> 08:28.701
Then we can all move on.

08:39.111 --> 08:41.011
Hey, mom.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.681
Look who's here.

08:42.748 --> 08:44.415
The world traveler
returns.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.117
Hi, baby.

08:46.184 --> 08:47.785
Sam called. He said he had
something to show me here.

08:47.852 --> 08:49.920
Yeah, he does.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.355
Sam! Michael's here!

08:51.422 --> 08:52.689
Mom, every time
I come over here these days,

08:52.757 --> 08:54.691
you've changed
something else.

08:54.759 --> 08:57.361
Yeah, well, I thought
you're starting a new life,

08:57.429 --> 08:58.929
so I'd make
a few changes myself.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.165
Hey, Mikey!

09:00.232 --> 09:01.533
Speaking of changes,
look at you.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.535
Yeah.
Back in my fighting shape.

09:03.603 --> 09:04.870
And by fighting shape,
of course I mean --

09:04.937 --> 09:06.938
We know, we know.
The ladies love it.

09:07.006 --> 09:08.373
What can I say?

09:08.441 --> 09:10.008
You know, I think I was
stress eating before,

09:10.076 --> 09:14.380
so I dropped a few pounds
since you nailed these guys.

09:14.448 --> 09:15.915
Please tell me the cleanup
is going well.

09:17.216 --> 09:18.450
Mike, come on.

09:18.518 --> 09:20.385
I had security clearance
back in the day, too.

09:20.453 --> 09:22.754
It's going well.
We're making progress.

09:22.822 --> 09:24.522
Progress is good.

09:24.590 --> 09:27.326
Okay, hey. Come on back.
I got a surprise for you.

09:29.762 --> 09:34.765
Okay, Mikey,
three guesses what it is.

09:34.833 --> 09:35.900
Is it --
is it my car?

09:35.967 --> 09:37.201
Ah.
Give the man a prize.

09:37.269 --> 09:38.903
Now, the, uh,
roof looks kind of like

09:38.971 --> 09:41.272
a tin can
mauled by a grizzly bear,

09:41.340 --> 09:43.208
but the power train and
the engine are still ticking,

09:43.275 --> 09:44.342
so I think
it's salvageable.

09:44.410 --> 09:45.243
Sam.
Mikey.

09:45.311 --> 09:47.613
Jesse?

09:47.680 --> 09:48.847
Nothing says "Welcome home"

09:48.915 --> 09:50.449
like 4,000 pounds
of mangled steel, right?

09:50.517 --> 09:52.284
I wanted to
take the tarp off.

09:52.352 --> 09:54.153
Sam wanted to let you
do it yourself.

09:54.221 --> 09:56.155
You know, more of a dramatic unveiling.
What are you doing here?

09:56.223 --> 09:57.656
Shouldn't you be in CIFA
in D.C.?

09:58.892 --> 10:00.425
I thought you told him.

10:00.493 --> 10:01.827
You didn't tell him?
I thought you told him.

10:01.895 --> 10:02.861
I didn't have time.
I just saw him.

10:02.929 --> 10:06.031
I was, but now I'm, um...

10:06.099 --> 10:08.867
Now I'm not. I quit.

10:08.935 --> 10:10.534
You quit?!
I quit. You know what it is?

10:10.602 --> 10:12.370
After everything I went through
with you guys,

10:12.437 --> 10:14.071
helping all those people,
I just --

10:14.139 --> 10:15.606
I can't do the government thing
anymore, man.

10:15.674 --> 10:17.341
It's too much red tape.
I just --

10:17.409 --> 10:19.544
it's harder than you think,
going back. You'll see.

10:19.612 --> 10:22.180
He's got a fancy job with a
private security firm down here.

10:22.248 --> 10:23.348
Big money.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.383
Well, the money's all right.
It's not bad.

10:25.451 --> 10:26.952
Actually helped me get this
bad boy out of impound, so --

10:27.019 --> 10:29.188
Uh...Thanks.

10:31.124 --> 10:33.192
Sam said the car
had some sentimental value,

10:33.260 --> 10:35.395
said it belonged
to your dad.

10:35.462 --> 10:37.730
Um, please tell me
that you want the car,

10:37.798 --> 10:38.964
'cause it was actually a huge
pain in my ass to get it here.

10:39.032 --> 10:42.234
This...is great.

10:42.301 --> 10:43.802
Things are heating up at work,
so don't expect any more favors.

10:43.869 --> 10:45.703
Enjoy this one.

10:45.771 --> 10:46.971
Well,
aren't you gonna unwrap it?

10:47.038 --> 10:49.039
I should take this.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.641
Is that the batphone?
Yeah.

10:50.709 --> 10:51.976
Yeah, duty calls.

10:52.043 --> 10:53.477
Hello?
It's Max.

10:53.545 --> 10:56.179
We need you
to get up to D.C., pronto.

10:56.247 --> 10:57.614
D.C.?

10:57.681 --> 10:59.449
I just got back to Miami
yesterday.

10:59.517 --> 11:00.984
Well,
hop on a plane, buddy.

11:01.052 --> 11:03.620
Raines decided we need a little
help on this interrogation.

11:03.688 --> 11:04.788
See you soon.

11:07.058 --> 11:09.826
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>you give up in intelligence</i>

11:09.894 --> 11:12.162
<i>is control</i>
<i>over your own schedule.</i>

11:12.230 --> 11:14.364
<i>It's a little like</i>
<i>being a doctor on call,</i>

11:14.432 --> 11:18.101
<i>only your emergencies tend</i>
<i>to be thousands of miles away.</i>

11:27.277 --> 11:30.813
So what's the problem?

11:30.881 --> 11:32.481
The problem is
he's not talking.

11:32.549 --> 11:34.617
Only one of these bastards
is left in the wild,

11:34.685 --> 11:36.452
and Hector there
still won't give him up.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.787
Anything new in here?

11:37.855 --> 11:40.489
No. The name "John Kessler"
and a blurry photo.

11:40.557 --> 11:43.659
Hard to believe he managed
to assemble so many operations

11:43.727 --> 11:46.262
and stay so off-the-radar,
but he pulled it off.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.598
The last one.
Yeah.

11:48.665 --> 11:49.966
We get him,
we get everything --

11:50.034 --> 11:52.402
not the mealy-mouthed
"I followed orders" B.S.

11:52.469 --> 11:54.204
We got
from all the other guys.

11:54.271 --> 11:57.040
Kessler got his hands dirty
on every spy they burned,

11:57.108 --> 12:00.210
every op they pulled --
all of it.

12:00.277 --> 12:01.444
But first,
we got to find him.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.380
And to do that,

12:03.448 --> 12:05.982
we need to get our friend
Hector, there, talking.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.483
What do you
want me to do?

12:07.551 --> 12:09.452
Just be the same
unstoppable son of a bitch

12:09.520 --> 12:12.422
I recruited
all those years ago.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.591
Do what you have to do.

12:14.658 --> 12:16.526
Listen, buddy,
I warned you.

12:16.594 --> 12:18.995
I gave you plenty of chances
to talk.

12:19.063 --> 12:21.732
You're leaving us
with no other choice

12:21.799 --> 12:24.201
but to move on
to other options,

12:24.268 --> 12:25.702
options that you're not
gonna like.

12:25.769 --> 12:27.437
Mm-hmm.
What's that supposed to mean?

12:27.505 --> 12:30.339
It means if you're not
gonna talk to me,

12:30.407 --> 12:32.508
you get to talk
to Michael Westen.

12:32.576 --> 12:34.443
He doesn't get
a government paycheck.

12:36.313 --> 12:40.083
He doesn't
play by our rules.

12:40.151 --> 12:41.518
Knock yourself out,
Michael.

12:41.586 --> 12:45.188
Nobody's watching.

12:45.256 --> 12:46.590
<i>The biggest obstacle</i>

12:46.658 --> 12:50.194
<i>you can face in</i>
<i>an interrogation is yourself --</i>

12:50.262 --> 12:51.763
<i>when your own feelings,</i>
<i>your own anger,</i>

12:51.830 --> 12:53.498
<i>your own desire for revenge</i>

12:53.565 --> 12:57.302
<i>are all that stand between you</i>
<i>and the information you want.</i>

12:57.369 --> 13:00.938
<i>The stronger your feelings are,</i>
<i>the hotter your hate burns,</i>

13:01.006 --> 13:03.641
<i>the more important it is</i>
<i>to set it aside.</i>

13:03.709 --> 13:05.676
Do you know
why they sent me in here?

13:05.744 --> 13:06.977
Yeah.

13:07.045 --> 13:09.280
Got a pretty good idea.

13:09.347 --> 13:12.483
They dismantled
the main camera,

13:12.551 --> 13:15.719
but they usually have
an extra one around here.

13:15.787 --> 13:16.820
Let's have a look.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.401
There we go.

13:30.469 --> 13:33.739
Now we can have
some real privacy.

13:33.806 --> 13:35.040
What are you gonna do?
You gonna torture me?

13:35.108 --> 13:36.041
It doesn't matter.
I'm not -- I'm not gonna --

13:36.109 --> 13:37.376
I'm not -- I'm not --

13:37.444 --> 13:39.812
calm down, calm down.
I'm not gonna hit you.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.347
I just want to
have a conversation.

13:41.415 --> 13:44.083
I'm not
gonna say anything.

13:44.151 --> 13:46.018
Okay, then I'll talk.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.321
You know, I've learned a lot
about your organization

13:48.388 --> 13:51.257
over the last four years.

13:51.325 --> 13:55.428
And the thing is, the more
I tried to dismantle it,

13:55.496 --> 13:58.665
the more I realized
it was just people.

13:58.732 --> 14:00.299
Not some abstract thing --

14:00.367 --> 14:03.636
just people trying to get work
done in a dangerous world,

14:03.704 --> 14:05.771
and having a few
burned spies around

14:05.839 --> 14:07.673
could make that possible.

14:07.741 --> 14:10.209
And the thing is,
I get it.

14:10.277 --> 14:13.179
I mean, plenty of us
have had that dream --

14:13.246 --> 14:15.615
an operations group
that didn't have to adhere

14:15.683 --> 14:17.116
to government bureaucracy,

14:17.184 --> 14:20.920
that could just act without
rules, without red tape.

14:22.923 --> 14:24.724
And you made that happen.

14:24.792 --> 14:27.528
Do I support
what it turned into? No.

14:27.595 --> 14:28.895
But I'd be lying

14:28.963 --> 14:34.301
if I said I didn't understand
that dream, Hector.

14:34.369 --> 14:35.803
I don't blame you.

14:35.870 --> 14:40.141
Even when
you pulled that knife on me,

14:40.208 --> 14:43.277
I knew you were just a guy
trying to survive.

14:43.345 --> 14:45.880
But the thing is, these guys,
they don't understand that.

14:45.948 --> 14:49.183
To them, you're just
member number 31

14:49.251 --> 14:51.719
in a criminal conspiracy
they need to dismantle.

14:51.787 --> 14:53.621
It doesn't
have to be that way.

14:53.689 --> 14:55.723
But you have to help me.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.328
Tell me where Kessler is.

15:00.396 --> 15:02.030
I can't.

15:02.098 --> 15:04.699
You don't understand.
He'll kill my family.

15:04.767 --> 15:05.968
Not if I get to him
first.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.736
How do you think
he's avoided you so long?

15:07.804 --> 15:08.837
He'll see you coming.

15:08.905 --> 15:10.071
He didn't see me coming

15:10.139 --> 15:12.107
when I took down
his entire organization.

15:12.175 --> 15:14.409
You want to protect your family?
I'm your best bet.

15:23.919 --> 15:25.487
You think
you can take him?

15:25.555 --> 15:26.822
Well, let me
put it this way --

15:26.889 --> 15:28.123
he was
the head of operations.

15:28.190 --> 15:29.791
He planned every project
that made my life hell

15:29.858 --> 15:32.093
for the last four years.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.794
I'd like to put those years
behind me,

15:33.862 --> 15:36.130
but I have a few questions,
questions only he can answer.

15:36.198 --> 15:37.665
So trust me.

15:37.733 --> 15:41.670
I want to talk to him more
than you can possibly imagine.

15:41.737 --> 15:44.773
Just tell me
what you know.

15:49.413 --> 15:51.481
What the hell did
you do to the camera in there?

15:51.548 --> 15:53.950
We've been deaf and blind
out here for an hour.

15:54.018 --> 15:55.451
It's in the trash can.
I disabled it.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.886
I don't need
to remind you --

15:56.954 --> 15:59.521
I went out on hell of a limb
bringing you back in.

15:59.589 --> 16:02.958
Kessler's in Caracas.
He's got a compound there.

16:03.025 --> 16:05.594
You want the address?
What?

16:05.661 --> 16:06.761
- How --
- You said to do what I had to do.

16:06.829 --> 16:08.263
I did what I had to do.

16:08.330 --> 16:09.798
You said he was good.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.601
What else?
Did you get details?

16:13.669 --> 16:16.037
Kessler's dug in.
We're gonna need a team.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.873
Oh, and one more thing --
I want to bring my people.

16:18.941 --> 16:21.910
Your people?
What people?

16:21.978 --> 16:24.547
You mean that ex-S.E.A.L.
and your <i>girlfriend?</i>

16:24.615 --> 16:26.949
Yes, the ex-S.E.A.L.
and my girlfriend.

16:27.017 --> 16:28.685
I can't have people
without clearance --

16:28.752 --> 16:31.154
Sam and Fi knew
the classified intel on this op

16:31.222 --> 16:32.456
before <i>you</i> did.

16:32.523 --> 16:34.725
They're two more pairs of boots
on the ground

16:34.793 --> 16:37.861
in a country that's not too
friendly with the CIA right now.

16:37.929 --> 16:39.763
Max will have
his team there.

16:39.831 --> 16:42.032
If you want my help,
I want <i>my</i> team.

16:43.901 --> 16:47.570
You know, I forgot what a pain
in the ass you could be, Westen.

16:47.638 --> 16:49.005
Yeah, but I'm worth it.

16:54.745 --> 16:58.215
<i>Intelligence agencies choose</i>
<i>their foreign command centers</i>

16:58.283 --> 17:00.117
<i>with a few things in mind.</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:03.855
<i>You want a place that's near</i>
<i>main roads but not on them.</i>

17:03.923 --> 17:06.424
<i>It's best if the owner</i>
<i>is on the payroll,</i>

17:06.492 --> 17:08.759
<i>or is controllable</i>
<i>in some other way.</i>

17:08.827 --> 17:10.361
<i>You want power</i>
<i>for the computers,</i>

17:10.429 --> 17:12.029
<i>air-conditioning</i>
<i>for the meetings,</i>

17:12.097 --> 17:14.031
<i>and a generous</i>
<i>late checkout policy</i>

17:14.098 --> 17:15.633
<i>in case an operation</i>
<i>goes wrong.</i>

17:15.701 --> 17:17.101
Hey, guys.
Welcome to Caracas.

17:17.169 --> 17:18.269
How was the flight?
Which one?

17:18.336 --> 17:19.470
It would have been better

17:19.537 --> 17:21.238
if we hadn't been
routed through Turkey.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.973
And Spain. And Costa Rica.
And if they had peanuts.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.209
Well, you know how
these jobs are.

17:25.277 --> 17:26.743
They got to bounce you around
a little bit

17:26.811 --> 17:27.944
to throw the dogs
off the scent.

17:28.012 --> 17:29.247
Come on.
Let's get inside.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.526
Okay, so, this is what our
taxpayer dollars get us, huh?

17:40.594 --> 17:43.663
It's low-key, and it's got
a great view of the street.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.431
If you got a couple of
<i>bolivares,</i> the bed vibrates.

17:45.499 --> 17:46.965
Used to be
the honeymoon suite.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.800
Well, in this room,
I'd ask for an annulment.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.402
Well, you don't have to
stay in here.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.671
You're staying in room
cinco-zero-cinco.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.040
It's been swept
by counter-intel,

17:54.107 --> 17:55.341
but try to keep the shop talk
down to a minimum.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.009
And don't drink the water.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.578
I got two guys on jello
and antibiotics so far.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.704
W-we're all staying
in the same room?

18:00.729 --> 18:01.929
Yeah.

18:01.948 --> 18:05.217
Wow. You really know how
to show a girl a good time.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.652
Well,
don't blame him.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.521
We don't have the resources
to secure the whole building.

18:08.589 --> 18:11.057
Hey, have, uh -- have a little something
from the mini-bar on Uncle Sam

18:11.125 --> 18:13.927
as my way of saying "I'm sorry."
Apology accepted.

18:13.995 --> 18:15.162
You two get settled in.

18:15.230 --> 18:17.065
Mike and I,
we're gonna over the details.

18:17.132 --> 18:19.667
Well, wait.

18:19.735 --> 18:21.702
We don't -- we don't need to
go over the details, too?

18:21.770 --> 18:24.505
Uh, Fiona,
just give us a minute.

18:27.009 --> 18:29.845
Is, uh -- is that
gonna be a problem?

18:29.913 --> 18:31.881
It'll be fine.

18:31.948 --> 18:34.184
I'm sorry. I know
they're part of the team.

18:34.251 --> 18:36.119
- Just regulations are regulations.
- What are we looking at?

18:36.187 --> 18:38.981
Kessler's compound. Right where
Hector said it would be.

18:38.982 --> 18:39.971
Can we get in?

18:39.972 --> 18:42.040
Well, we <i>could,</i>
<i>but we'd never get out.</i>

18:42.127 --> 18:44.995
Alarm's wired directly
to the central police station.

18:45.063 --> 18:46.163
We raid the place,

18:46.231 --> 18:47.698
there's gonna be
a huge fire fight.

18:47.766 --> 18:48.999
We'd never extract our team
before the Venezuelans arrived.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.534
Hit him on the road.

18:50.602 --> 18:52.435
Unfortunately, Kessler
doesn't travel that much.

18:52.503 --> 18:53.970
And when he does,
he sticks to places

18:54.038 --> 18:55.605
with as much security
as he has at home.

18:55.673 --> 18:57.273
He drives
an armored S.U.V., too.

18:57.341 --> 18:59.041
And there's no way
I can get an okay

18:59.109 --> 19:01.577
to hit him with anything that's
big enough to make a dent.

19:01.645 --> 19:04.113
So, that leaves us
with what?

19:04.181 --> 19:06.749
Well, <i>you,</i> my friend.

19:06.816 --> 19:09.352
Meet commandante
Armando Puente.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.688
He runs a military checkpoint

19:11.756 --> 19:13.390
that Kessler travels through
regularly.

19:13.457 --> 19:16.526
He was trained in Cuba by the
Soviets during the late '80s.

19:16.594 --> 19:19.896
Since your Russian's
better than mine...

19:19.964 --> 19:22.465
I'm gonna
make a new comrade.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.901
Technically, "Vasily Andropov"
gets to make a new comrade

19:24.969 --> 19:27.237
and then convince that comrade
to look the other way

19:27.305 --> 19:28.338
when our team goes in.

19:28.406 --> 19:30.573
Study up, Vasily.

19:30.641 --> 19:31.774
There's a full legend
in the file.

19:31.842 --> 19:34.111
This is a surgical strike,
Michael.

19:34.178 --> 19:35.979
If anything goes wrong,
we're gonna have

19:36.047 --> 19:37.981
a major international
incident on our hands.

19:38.049 --> 19:39.883
And if you end up
in a Venezuelan prison...

19:39.951 --> 19:41.117
Yeah, yeah.

19:41.185 --> 19:42.519
It's gonna be tough
to do a prisoner swap

19:42.586 --> 19:44.454
for a spy
who's still officially burned.

19:44.521 --> 19:47.123
I get it.
I can handle it.

19:47.191 --> 19:50.059
Talk to your team,
get cleaned up.

19:50.126 --> 19:52.361
You scout the checkpoint
at 1400 hours.

19:57.533 --> 20:00.901
Oh, sightseeing is so much
more fun with a machete

20:00.969 --> 20:02.569
and scouting
a military checkpoint.

20:02.637 --> 20:05.272
Maybe your CIA buddies
could throw in a hotel

20:05.339 --> 20:06.907
and some flight upgrades.

20:06.975 --> 20:09.543
I could get used to
a vacation like that.

20:09.610 --> 20:10.677
I'm glad
<i>you're</i> enjoying it.

20:10.745 --> 20:11.778
Well, that makes
one of us.

20:11.845 --> 20:14.448
How long is this gonna take,
Mikey?

20:14.516 --> 20:16.216
I got a half a bottle of Tequila
waiting for me back at the hotel.

20:16.284 --> 20:18.419
What? They said
not to drink the water.

20:21.656 --> 20:25.125
Ooh, it looks nasty. What are
you doing here, exactly?

20:25.193 --> 20:28.696
Offering a bribe to him
in the officer's uniform.

20:28.764 --> 20:30.665
All right, I'm gonna need
a little private time with him.

20:30.732 --> 20:32.200
Give me about 10 minutes?

20:32.267 --> 20:34.201
Yeah, I think Chuck Finley
and his wife can handle that.

20:34.269 --> 20:36.337
What do you think,
Darlene?

20:36.405 --> 20:38.506
Actually,
you're Tara and Greg Winter.

20:38.573 --> 20:41.275
Max already backstopped you
with passports, licenses,

20:41.343 --> 20:42.877
baggage-claim stubs.

20:42.945 --> 20:45.613
Yeah, yeah. Everything except
the monogrammed socks. Great.

20:45.681 --> 20:47.815
The Winters are gonna have some
car trouble at the checkpoint.

20:47.883 --> 20:50.051
- Okay, so you need us to rig a car.
- Max already did that.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.585
Oh, I see,
so it's probably

20:51.653 --> 20:52.520
one of these fancy-shmancy
pre-rigged things,

20:52.588 --> 20:53.922
totally state-of-the-art.

20:53.990 --> 20:56.457
Top secret.
Uh-huh. Completely undetectable.

20:56.525 --> 20:57.692
Yeah,
I could have done that

20:57.760 --> 20:59.327
with some olive oil
on the engine block.

20:59.395 --> 21:01.396
Well, I guess that's the world
of the big leagues.

21:01.463 --> 21:03.564
Okay, come one.
Let's get this done.

21:08.571 --> 21:11.172
<i>When you're working</i>
<i>under a cover I.D. overseas,</i>

21:11.240 --> 21:13.141
<i>it's all about</i>
<i>the little things.</i>

21:13.209 --> 21:16.144
<i>The farther you are from home,</i>
<i>the higher the stakes.</i>

21:16.212 --> 21:17.646
<i>That's why you study.</i>

21:17.713 --> 21:19.981
<i>You have to know every visa</i>
<i>on your passport,</i>

21:20.049 --> 21:21.817
<i>every detail on every document,</i>

21:21.884 --> 21:25.287
<i>the entire history of the</i>
<i>person you're claiming to be.</i>

21:25.355 --> 21:28.157
<i>It's true whether you're</i>
<i>pretending to be a Russian spy</i>

21:28.225 --> 21:29.993
<i>on a foreign</i>
<i>recruitment mission</i>

21:30.060 --> 21:33.730
<i>or a clueless American tourist</i>
<i>with a bad rental car.</i>

21:33.797 --> 21:35.465
Well, I certainly
didn't rent the damn thing.

21:35.533 --> 21:36.766
Well, what do you
want me to say?

21:36.834 --> 21:38.401
I'm sorry. I mean,
we're here in Venezuela.

21:38.469 --> 21:40.403
It's not like there's a lot
of choice of rental cars here.

21:40.471 --> 21:41.438
<i>Señor.</i>

21:41.505 --> 21:42.773
Huh? Yes, sir?

21:42.840 --> 21:44.441
<i>Señor, por favor,</i>
<i>se tiene que mueve.</i>

21:44.509 --> 21:46.209
I would love to, okay?
<i>Yo quiero</i> vroom vroom.

21:46.277 --> 21:48.111
But as you can see,
the car is <i>en fuego.</i>

21:48.179 --> 21:49.479
It's on fire.

21:49.547 --> 21:51.447
<i>No me importe</i>
<i>cual es el problema.</i>

21:51.515 --> 21:52.748
I hope that means
you're gonna get a mechanic.

21:52.816 --> 21:53.949
'Cause otherwise --
<i>señor, por favor.</i>

21:54.016 --> 21:54.916
Here we go.

21:54.984 --> 21:56.451
I'm gonna fix it

21:56.519 --> 21:59.354
'cause you certainly
don't know what you're doing.

21:59.422 --> 22:01.389
Oh, boy. Yeah,
you really nailed it there.

22:01.457 --> 22:03.758
Sir, <i>por favor.</i>
<i>Sir, give us a break, please.</i>

22:03.826 --> 22:07.128
Well, help us.
Help us.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.696
<i>Por favor,</i> it's kaput.
We need help.

22:08.764 --> 22:10.731
<i>¿Cual?</i> Pepe.

22:10.799 --> 22:13.434
<i>When you're recruiting an asset</i>
<i>from a hostile country,</i>

22:13.502 --> 22:16.203
<i>you pose as a citizen of</i>
<i>one of your target's allies.</i>

22:17.772 --> 22:19.740
<i>Someone who would never help</i>
<i>the United States,</i>

22:19.807 --> 22:20.808
<i>for example...</i>

22:25.213 --> 22:27.547
<i>...Might be perfectly happy</i>
<i>to help a Russian.</i>

23:01.115 --> 23:02.749
Engl-- English.

23:02.817 --> 23:04.185
Fine.

23:07.956 --> 23:09.556
Now, why are you here?

23:09.624 --> 23:12.493
For this man.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.094
<i>Señor</i> Kessler.

23:14.162 --> 23:17.398
He drives through here,
always with armed guards.

23:17.466 --> 23:19.267
He is...American.

23:19.335 --> 23:21.636
What do you want with him?

23:21.704 --> 23:23.571
This man has committed
many crimes in my country,

23:23.639 --> 23:24.873
terrible crimes.

23:24.941 --> 23:26.842
<i>Señor</i> Kessler
is well-connected.

23:26.909 --> 23:29.045
He has friends
in government,

23:29.112 --> 23:30.746
he has money.

23:30.814 --> 23:33.215
That is why I come to you,
comrade.

23:33.283 --> 23:37.152
Other men get rich
off this criminal,

23:37.220 --> 23:38.220
but you,
you serve this country.

23:38.287 --> 23:39.821
This man is very dangerous.

23:39.889 --> 23:42.624
You would be doing a great
service to your country

23:42.691 --> 23:44.192
and to my country.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.594
All you have to do
is bring him here alone,

23:46.662 --> 23:48.697
and my team will take care
of the rest.

23:48.765 --> 23:52.167
Think about it, comrade.

23:52.235 --> 23:54.069
I will be at this address
this afternoon.

23:55.805 --> 23:58.507
I hope to see you soon.

23:58.575 --> 24:02.911
I will make it
worth your while.

24:04.514 --> 24:07.216
<i>It's always a tense time</i>
<i>right after you've made a pitch</i>

24:07.283 --> 24:09.452
<i>to recruit an asset</i>
<i>on foreign soil.</i>

24:09.519 --> 24:11.787
<i>If they accept,</i>
<i>you're in business.</i>

24:11.855 --> 24:14.056
<i>If they decline,</i>
<i>you're in jail,</i>

24:14.124 --> 24:15.924
<i>which is why it's a good idea</i>
<i>to have backup.</i>

24:15.992 --> 24:17.259
Don't worry.

24:17.327 --> 24:19.328
He's only a few minutes late.
He'll be here.

24:19.396 --> 24:21.697
Well, when he does
get here, quit talking in my ear.

24:21.765 --> 24:23.199
If he hears you,
I'm dead.

24:23.266 --> 24:24.734
He's not gonna
hear anything.

24:24.802 --> 24:26.836
That radio's so far down
your ear canal

24:26.904 --> 24:28.137
it's tickling
your brain.

24:31.643 --> 24:34.945
Okay, Michael, Puente's here.
Look Russian.

24:35.013 --> 24:37.715
Commander, you came.
I was beginning to worry.

24:41.354 --> 24:44.222
Is there
something wrong?

24:44.290 --> 24:46.391
I spoke to a friend
at FSB.

24:46.459 --> 24:48.226
He said he has never heard
of your operation.

24:50.696 --> 24:52.430
Who are you?

24:52.498 --> 24:54.165
You pull a gun on me.

24:54.233 --> 24:55.667
Abort, abort!

24:55.734 --> 24:57.168
Get the extraction team ready.

24:57.236 --> 24:58.386
Alpha team
getting into position.

24:58.556 --> 24:59.310
Wait, are you kidding?

24:59.335 --> 25:00.846
Michael's never gonna
let you just pull him.

25:00.847 --> 25:01.780
Let him sell it.

25:01.781 --> 25:02.612
What are you talking about?
We can't let him --

25:02.613 --> 25:04.960
He can handle himself.
Just give him what he needs.

25:06.278 --> 25:07.779
Alpha team, stand by.

25:07.846 --> 25:10.481
Find Puente's FSB contact.
Now!

25:10.549 --> 25:12.383
I will not
ask you again. Who are you?

25:12.450 --> 25:13.517
I told you.

25:13.585 --> 25:15.919
I am Vasily Andropov.

25:15.986 --> 25:17.620
My friend said there is
no such person at FSB!

25:17.688 --> 25:20.356
Calm down, calm down.

25:20.424 --> 25:21.423
I will calm down!

25:22.792 --> 25:24.459
When you tell me
who you are.

25:24.527 --> 25:26.495
Then I am calling
security forces,

25:26.563 --> 25:28.830
and you can
explain yourself to them.

25:28.898 --> 25:32.434
There are three FSB operatives
specializing in Venezuela --

25:32.501 --> 25:36.438
Viktor Banin, Bogdan Egorov,
and Gennady Yohzin.

25:36.506 --> 25:37.973
<i>Magicians and mind readers</i>

25:38.040 --> 25:40.442
<i>often use a technique</i>
<i>known as shotgunning...</i>

25:40.510 --> 25:42.811
I spoke with Banin
yesterday.

25:42.879 --> 25:45.515
Uh, he told me
this might happen.

25:45.582 --> 25:48.018
<i>...In which you determine</i>
<i>what your target is thinking</i>

25:48.085 --> 25:49.953
<i>by throwing a bunch</i>
<i>of information at them</i>

25:50.021 --> 25:51.888
<i>and reading their reactions.</i>

25:51.956 --> 25:54.558
I don't know
Viktor Banin.

25:54.626 --> 25:56.427
<i>It's effective for spies,</i>
<i>as well,</i>

25:56.495 --> 25:58.596
<i>but it's considerably harder</i>
<i>to do</i>

25:58.664 --> 25:59.597
<i>with a gun pointed at you.</i>

26:01.701 --> 26:04.136
Of course
you don't know Banin.

26:04.203 --> 26:05.871
I spoke with Gennady.

26:05.939 --> 26:10.242
Eh, it is their job to shoot
your good friend Bogdan

26:10.310 --> 26:14.246
if this mission goes wrong.

26:14.314 --> 26:17.316
All teams stand by.

26:18.719 --> 26:20.119
How do you know Bogdan?

26:20.187 --> 26:22.088
I am an FSB Agent.

26:22.155 --> 26:23.889
I don't come to this mission

26:23.957 --> 26:27.227
without knowing who you are
and who your friends are.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.897
Tell me this --
why has not Bogdan

26:30.965 --> 26:32.465
heard of this operation?

26:32.533 --> 26:34.613
Bogdan is an FSB analyst
in Saint Petersburg.

26:34.789 --> 26:35.857
He's a computer nerd.

26:35.882 --> 26:38.239
Uh, tech specialist
in Latin-American studies.

26:38.606 --> 26:40.974
Here we go --
disciplined for alcohol abuse.

26:41.042 --> 26:42.375
The guy's a booze hound.

26:42.443 --> 26:43.877
He's an alcoholic, Mike.

26:43.944 --> 26:46.179
What can I say?
Maybe he was too drunk

26:46.247 --> 26:48.849
or too busy
playing with his computers

26:48.917 --> 26:50.684
to notice the memo
on his desk!

26:50.752 --> 26:53.220
I am sure that
when he is executed

26:53.288 --> 26:54.655
for ruining this operation,

26:54.722 --> 26:56.891
he will wish he was
a little more attentive.

26:56.958 --> 26:59.993
You have a decision to make,
comrade.

27:00.061 --> 27:01.295
You can shoot me,

27:01.362 --> 27:03.296
but then you will explain
yourself to the FSB

27:03.364 --> 27:04.564
and to the police.

27:04.632 --> 27:06.699
You can leave,
and I will find someone else.

27:06.767 --> 27:09.068
Or you can help me
with the American,

27:09.136 --> 27:11.337
you collect your fee,

27:11.405 --> 27:13.639
and you keep
your mouth shut.

27:17.410 --> 27:18.644
Come on, Mike.

27:30.188 --> 27:32.156
If I find you are lying,

27:32.224 --> 27:34.925
I will not hesitate
to shoot you.

27:34.993 --> 27:38.363
I would expect nothing less
from a soldier.

27:38.431 --> 27:40.165
Let us drink.

27:40.233 --> 27:41.900
<i>Na zdorov'e.</i>

27:52.168 --> 27:53.128
All right, everybody,

27:53.129 --> 27:55.197
I'm gonna review this one time,
so pay attention.

27:55.263 --> 27:57.198
Michael and I will be
in the command van, here.

27:57.265 --> 27:59.300
Kessler will approach the
checkpoint, moving southbound.

27:59.368 --> 28:01.436
When he gets to the checkpoint,
we have an asset in place

28:01.504 --> 28:02.737
that will separate him
from his security.

28:02.805 --> 28:05.339
Michael, you want to
go over those details?

28:05.407 --> 28:06.474
I've arranged with the commander
of the checkpoint

28:06.542 --> 28:09.077
to take Kessler
into the outbuilding

28:09.145 --> 28:11.446
to view his documents while
keeping his soldiers outside.

28:11.514 --> 28:14.283
At this point, the extraction
team will enter from the east

28:14.351 --> 28:17.019
using the forest as cover.
Remember...

28:17.087 --> 28:18.221
You're supposed to be

28:18.288 --> 28:19.522
a Russian team,
so speak Russian.

28:19.590 --> 28:20.890
Or keep your mouths shut.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.592
From there,
he goes to the transpo team,

28:22.660 --> 28:24.494
which puts him in a box
and gets him on a plane.

28:24.562 --> 28:26.864
Documents has already
created the paperwork.

28:26.932 --> 28:28.065
Are we clear?

28:28.133 --> 28:29.500
All right,
remember this guy Kessler,

28:29.568 --> 28:31.469
he ran his own covert ops
for a long time.

28:31.537 --> 28:32.937
He did it well.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.474
He's not gonna be a pushover,
so be ready for anything.

28:35.541 --> 28:38.709
Okay. Let's move out.

28:41.913 --> 28:43.814
Yeah, hey, Mike, uh,
can we talk to you for a second?

28:43.882 --> 28:45.282
Sam, I don't have time.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.317
Well,
I suggest you make time.

28:47.753 --> 28:51.455
Max put Sam and me on bag-watching
duty at the airport.

28:51.522 --> 28:52.722
What's next,
coffee detail?

28:52.790 --> 28:54.157
- Fi...
- She's got a point, Mike.

28:54.225 --> 28:55.793
I mean, you say
we're part of the team,

28:55.860 --> 28:57.661
but we're definitely not
part of the action.

28:57.729 --> 28:58.896
You <i>have</i> been part of it,

28:58.964 --> 29:00.564
which is why
you have to hang back now.

29:00.632 --> 29:03.167
Puente thinks you're American
tourists with a bad rental car.

29:03.234 --> 29:05.737
If he sees your faces again,
he'll know we set him up.

29:05.804 --> 29:07.171
Well, look,
we can stay out of sight

29:07.239 --> 29:08.540
and still be ready
to back you up.

29:08.607 --> 29:10.508
Sam, you know this is
the way they do things.

29:10.575 --> 29:13.044
Different teams have different
jobs, for operational security.

29:13.112 --> 29:14.379
"Operational security"?

29:14.446 --> 29:16.448
What happened to the way
we do things?

29:16.515 --> 29:17.949
It's their show, Fi.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.117
It's <i>our</i> show,
too, brother.

29:19.185 --> 29:20.185
We should be able to
see this through.

29:20.253 --> 29:21.620
I mean, right is right.

29:21.688 --> 29:22.988
All right,
Michael, let's go.

29:23.056 --> 29:24.523
Bravo team's
already moving out.

29:24.591 --> 29:25.992
I got to go.
I'm sorry.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.494
I'll see you
back in Miami.

29:31.299 --> 29:35.168
<i>The challenge of a good</i>
<i>large-scale field operation</i>

29:35.236 --> 29:36.803
<i>is to keep all parts</i>
<i>coordinated</i>

29:36.871 --> 29:40.306
<i>while keeping them</i>
<i>as separate as possible.</i>

29:40.374 --> 29:44.611
<i>Field units are separate</i>
<i>from transportation units...</i>

29:47.181 --> 29:49.982
<i>...With the command unit</i>
<i>separate from both.</i>

29:50.050 --> 29:53.252
<i>When things go right, they all</i>
<i>work together as one big team.</i>

29:53.320 --> 29:55.121
Okay, we've got
the target moving.

29:59.527 --> 30:02.062
It's all you, buddy.

30:06.033 --> 30:08.268
Extraction team, stand by.

30:10.404 --> 30:13.707
Mr. Kessler, I need you
to come inside for a second.

30:16.444 --> 30:17.945
Is there a problem?

30:18.012 --> 30:20.347
There's no problem.
Just some documents to sign.

30:20.415 --> 30:22.116
Please, come inside.

30:22.183 --> 30:24.051
Okay,
everybody ready.

30:24.119 --> 30:26.287
<i>The problem</i>
<i>with remote command centers</i>

30:26.355 --> 30:28.355
<i>is what happens</i>
<i>when things go wrong.</i>

30:28.423 --> 30:29.790
What's going on, Max?

30:29.858 --> 30:31.693
What the hell is happening?

30:31.760 --> 30:33.128
<i>Anyone stuck</i>
<i>in the command center</i>

30:33.195 --> 30:34.863
<i>is too far away</i>
<i>to do anything about it.</i>

30:34.931 --> 30:36.431
Damn it!

30:36.499 --> 30:38.900
The radios are not working!

30:38.968 --> 30:40.001
We've got no contact.

30:40.069 --> 30:42.270
Kessler knew we were here.

30:42.338 --> 30:44.506
We're blown.

30:44.574 --> 30:46.943
Fi, not a good time.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

30:49.680 --> 30:51.448
Wait. Where are you?
Red team, come in.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.450
We're about 50 yards
from the checkpoint.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.652
Fi, you were supposed to be
at the airport.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.987
Yeah, well,
we decided to stick around

30:57.054 --> 30:58.355
and watch the "experts"
do their thing.

30:58.422 --> 30:59.422
What's happening
out there?

30:59.490 --> 31:00.856
I'm not sure.

31:00.924 --> 31:02.758
It looks like Kessler picked up
on your radio frequencies

31:02.826 --> 31:04.060
and jammed them.

31:04.127 --> 31:05.527
They must have had some kind
of scanner in the car.

31:08.798 --> 31:09.898
How many down?

31:09.965 --> 31:11.432
The smoke is still clearing,
but it's bad.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.500
He's moving.

31:13.568 --> 31:15.436
He's heading
back to the compound.

31:15.503 --> 31:17.872
- I hope you have a plan "B."
- I'm working on it, Fi.

31:23.211 --> 31:25.345
Kessler's men took out the team
before they could move in.

31:25.413 --> 31:26.780
Sam and Fi are helping
the survivors.

31:26.847 --> 31:28.014
Sam and Fi? Sam and Fi
are supposed to be --

31:28.082 --> 31:29.983
They're helping
with survivors!

31:30.051 --> 31:31.684
Kessler's on his way
to the compound.

31:31.752 --> 31:33.586
We got less than 20 minutes
to salvage this.

31:33.654 --> 31:35.989
- How the hell are we gonna salvage --
- Just get in the van!

31:36.057 --> 31:38.290
There he goes.
This is our last chance.

31:42.095 --> 31:43.930
Uh, what's going on here?
Do we have a plan?

31:43.997 --> 31:45.865
A plan? No.

31:45.933 --> 31:47.400
I got some tactical goals
and a rough approach.

31:47.468 --> 31:49.468
A rough approach?
Oh, well, that's terrific.

31:49.536 --> 31:51.070
Thank God we've got that.

31:51.138 --> 31:53.706
Because we don't have back-up,
video feeds, or working comms.

31:53.774 --> 31:54.907
Welcome to my world.

31:59.746 --> 32:01.046
You're sure
you want to do this?

32:01.114 --> 32:02.347
I am not letting this go.

32:02.415 --> 32:03.748
This is our chance
to get Kessler

32:03.816 --> 32:05.650
before we're swamped
with security forces.

32:05.717 --> 32:08.518
You want out, I'll slow down,
but I am <i>not</i> stopping.

32:10.054 --> 32:11.321
Floor it!
Hang on!

32:30.574 --> 32:32.776
- Is this seriously how you do things?
- When I have to.

32:34.511 --> 32:36.279
How are you still alive?

32:36.346 --> 32:37.380
Good question.

32:38.949 --> 32:40.784
I eat a lot of yogurt.

32:48.416 --> 32:50.718
I think we're a little
out-gunned here.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.573
Grenade.

32:55.018 --> 32:56.686
Make that a <i>lot</i> out-gunned.

32:58.755 --> 33:00.956
If you cover me,
I can flank him

33:01.024 --> 33:03.059
and take him out
from the woods.

33:07.597 --> 33:09.765
Or you could just shoot him.
That works, too.

33:09.832 --> 33:11.466
Let's get inside.

33:11.534 --> 33:13.401
We're gonna have every cop and
soldier in Caracas here in a minute.

33:13.468 --> 33:14.602
Keep your head down.

33:32.419 --> 33:34.320
Oh, I think we lost him.

33:34.388 --> 33:36.589
I don't think we lost him.
I think he doubled back.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.964
Or we're both wrong.
No! Don't shoot.

33:44.032 --> 33:45.365
I want him alive.

34:03.617 --> 34:05.285
Steel door.

34:05.353 --> 34:07.521
Ugh, a safe room?
Something like that.

34:07.589 --> 34:09.623
The walls are metal.

34:09.692 --> 34:11.659
All right,
unless you have a thermal Lance,

34:11.726 --> 34:12.927
I'm calling this one.

34:12.995 --> 34:15.730
No. I'm not leaving here
with the job undone.

34:15.797 --> 34:18.833
This is not about
your personal revenge, Michael.

34:18.902 --> 34:20.402
We'll can get him
another time.

34:20.469 --> 34:22.237
How? You don't know
anything about him.

34:22.304 --> 34:24.440
He compromised a secure
CIA communications system.

34:24.507 --> 34:27.009
What do you think you're gonna do,
just grab him at the airport?

34:27.077 --> 34:28.411
Fi, you guys all right?

34:28.478 --> 34:29.879
As well
as could be expected.

34:29.946 --> 34:32.114
The team is pulling out
with their wounded now.

34:32.181 --> 34:33.181
I need you to buy us
a little time.

34:33.248 --> 34:34.583
Slow the cops down.

34:34.650 --> 34:36.717
Do you know the choke-point
on the road near the bridge?

34:36.786 --> 34:39.621
All traffic going to Kessler's
has got to pass through there.

34:39.688 --> 34:42.291
And you want us
to stop them?

34:42.359 --> 34:43.860
Consider it done.

34:43.927 --> 34:45.094
I don't know what you think

34:45.161 --> 34:46.797
buying us a few extra minutes
is gonna do.

34:49.034 --> 34:51.034
It would take us hours to get
through that with the right tools,

34:51.101 --> 34:52.302
and we don't have <i>anything.</i>

34:52.370 --> 34:54.038
Kessler's men
have grenades.

34:54.105 --> 34:56.139
We do this right,
we can make a hole.

34:56.206 --> 34:59.076
Old-school. I like that.
I got 'em.

34:59.144 --> 35:02.713
<i>The most vulnerable system</i>
<i>in any reinforced structure</i>

35:02.780 --> 35:04.514
<i>is typically ventilation.</i>

35:04.582 --> 35:06.950
<i>Holes that let in air</i>
<i>can also let in other things,</i>

35:07.018 --> 35:09.486
<i>like the explosive cores</i>
<i>of concussion grenades,</i>

35:09.554 --> 35:11.088
<i>for example.</i>

35:11.155 --> 35:14.091
<i>They're a high-quality</i>
<i>explosive and quite effective.</i>

35:14.159 --> 35:16.293
<i>Of course, you have to</i>
<i>get them into place</i>

35:16.361 --> 35:17.929
<i>without blowing your hands off.</i>

35:21.834 --> 35:23.234
Hurry it up, Sam.

35:23.302 --> 35:25.637
We've got about 30 seconds
before <i>la policía</i> get here.

35:25.705 --> 35:27.105
Yeah, well, you know what?

35:27.173 --> 35:29.675
Next time Tara and Greg Winter
take a vacation,

35:29.743 --> 35:31.877
<i>you</i> get to soak the upholstery
in gasoline.

35:32.980 --> 35:36.883
Well,
first bullets, now fire.

35:36.951 --> 35:40.120
So long, old girl.

35:40.188 --> 35:43.225
So, you think the CIA's
insurance plan covers that?

35:43.293 --> 35:44.660
Maybe.

35:44.727 --> 35:47.429
But I doubt
it covers this.

35:56.304 --> 35:58.004
Last chance, Kessler!

35:58.072 --> 36:00.706
<i>As a spy,</i>
<i>your job is intelligence.</i>

36:00.774 --> 36:04.109
You might want to back up
away from the wall!

36:04.177 --> 36:06.145
<i>Whether you're after</i>
<i>national-security secrets</i>

36:06.212 --> 36:07.446
<i>or operational information</i>

36:07.514 --> 36:09.347
<i>about the people</i>
<i>who destroyed your life,</i>

36:09.415 --> 36:11.249
<i>the job is the same.</i>

36:11.317 --> 36:12.884
We'll go in quick.
He'll be stunned.

36:12.951 --> 36:15.419
Anything to get us out of here
sooner, I'm all for. Do it.

36:17.656 --> 36:20.758
<i>There's no greater satisfaction</i>
<i>than that moment</i>

36:20.826 --> 36:22.927
<i>when you finally get the</i>
<i>answers you're looking for.</i>

36:22.995 --> 36:24.329
Is he alive?

36:24.397 --> 36:25.831
<i>And nothing is harder to take</i>

36:25.899 --> 36:28.968
<i>than having those answers</i>
<i>forever taken away.</i>

36:29.036 --> 36:30.236
He's dead.

36:30.304 --> 36:31.571
I thought you said the blast
wasn't enough to --

36:31.639 --> 36:33.740
it wasn't the blast.
He shot himself.

36:36.011 --> 36:39.413
Well, I guess he didn't
want to be taken alive.

36:39.481 --> 36:41.949
Well, it happens.
We did our best.

36:42.016 --> 36:44.250
That's it?

36:44.318 --> 36:46.252
All this way?

36:46.320 --> 36:49.455
After all these years?
That's it?

36:49.522 --> 36:51.156
Hey, hey.
That's it?!

36:51.224 --> 36:53.291
Hey, listen!
I'm sorry, man.

36:53.359 --> 36:54.993
But if you want tidy endings and easy
answers, you picked the wrong job.

36:55.060 --> 36:56.427
He's gone.

36:56.495 --> 36:58.496
And the police are here.
We got to find a way out.

37:01.901 --> 37:04.069
Come on. Come on.

37:08.208 --> 37:10.042
<i>A well-trained police force</i>
<i>knows</i>

37:10.110 --> 37:12.745
<i>that the first priority</i>
<i>when arriving at a scene</i>

37:12.813 --> 37:15.482
<i>is to establish a perimeter</i>
<i>and lock down the area.</i>

37:15.549 --> 37:16.850
<i>You let them do that</i>

37:16.918 --> 37:18.652
<i>and, chances are,</i>
<i>you're not getting out.</i>

37:18.720 --> 37:20.387
I think Kessler's gun
had a spare clip.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.389
We can hold them off
for a little while, but...

37:22.457 --> 37:23.957
We won't be able to
shoot our way out.

37:24.025 --> 37:25.592
At least not that way.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.862
Grab that fan.
I got an idea.

37:28.930 --> 37:31.031
<i>That's why it's important</i>
<i>to make sure</i>

37:31.099 --> 37:32.700
<i>that they have</i>
<i>a higher priority,</i>

37:32.767 --> 37:35.235
<i>like dealing</i>
<i>with a more urgent threat.</i>

37:37.705 --> 37:42.142
<i>If you've got enough ammunition</i>
<i>and a good oscillating fan,</i>

37:42.210 --> 37:45.646
<i>you can keep them busy</i>
<i>dealing with your gun...</i>

37:48.450 --> 37:49.784
<i>...While you're busy</i>
<i>getting away.</i>

38:02.858 --> 38:05.092
Well,
we made the papers.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.427
Not exactly the goal
of this little operation,

38:07.495 --> 38:08.662
but it's something.

38:08.730 --> 38:09.766
Could be worse,
I guess.

38:09.767 --> 38:10.901
Could be a picture
of our corpses.

38:10.967 --> 38:13.439
Is my Spanish that bad
or does this say,

38:13.440 --> 38:15.907
"The shootings are believed to be
a part of a kidnapping attempt

38:15.975 --> 38:17.442
by a Colombian cartel?"

38:17.510 --> 38:19.410
Yeah.
P.R. guys did a good job.

38:19.478 --> 38:21.445
We got out clean.
Clean?

38:21.513 --> 38:23.847
With two team members K.I.A.
And a dead target?

38:23.915 --> 38:25.582
I don't know
what to tell you, Michael.

38:25.650 --> 38:27.084
Our job
is to do the impossible.

38:27.151 --> 38:28.552
We took Kessler
out of the game.

38:28.619 --> 38:30.287
Yeah, with help
from a few pinch hitters.

38:30.354 --> 38:31.621
You're never gonna hear it
from the agency

38:31.689 --> 38:33.590
because officially
you were never in Caracas,

38:33.658 --> 38:36.360
but thank you.

38:36.428 --> 38:37.695
It would have been a lot worse
without you.

38:37.763 --> 38:39.764
Unofficially,
you're welcome.

38:39.832 --> 38:41.733
Anything for the cause.

38:41.801 --> 38:45.605
So this is how it ends --
a body on the ground.

38:45.672 --> 38:47.774
Yeah, but he put a bullet
in his own head and not yours.

38:47.841 --> 38:49.376
Hey,
I'll drink to that.

38:49.443 --> 38:51.678
Mike, you won.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.113
The people that burned you,
the whole damn network --

38:53.180 --> 38:54.381
it's done.

38:54.448 --> 38:55.649
To new beginnings.

38:59.219 --> 39:01.955
Mike, uh, you're kind of
leaving us hanging, here.

39:20.175 --> 39:22.109
I saw the door open.

39:22.177 --> 39:23.744
What are you doing here?

39:23.812 --> 39:25.913
I hope
I didn't surprise you, mom.

39:25.981 --> 39:28.216
I-I thought you were out.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.519
No, I was just at my yoga class
at the "Y."

39:31.587 --> 39:34.322
Glad to see you're
taking care of yourself.

39:34.389 --> 39:36.190
Hmm.

39:36.258 --> 39:38.025
Oh, well. Baby steps.

39:38.093 --> 39:40.094
Which reminds me --

39:40.162 --> 39:42.830
Sam said that you're on your way
back to your old job.

39:42.898 --> 39:44.765
Something like that.

39:46.701 --> 39:48.902
He also said that

39:48.969 --> 39:51.170
you didn't quite find
what you were looking for

39:51.238 --> 39:52.838
in your trip down south.

39:52.906 --> 39:57.511
I had a chance
to finally get some answers,

39:57.578 --> 40:00.514
make sense
of the last four years.

40:00.582 --> 40:03.017
And that chance ended up
in a body bag.

40:04.887 --> 40:09.491
You know, all those years
I lived with your father,

40:09.559 --> 40:13.529
I used to think through
millions of ways

40:13.597 --> 40:16.265
that I could confront him,

40:16.332 --> 40:19.067
everything
that I wanted to say.

40:19.135 --> 40:21.837
And all of a sudden,
he drops dead.

40:21.904 --> 40:22.838
That's it.

40:25.875 --> 40:27.443
You know...

40:27.510 --> 40:30.980
People talk about "closure,"

40:31.048 --> 40:34.584
but I don't buy it.

40:34.652 --> 40:38.488
When somebody blasts a hole
in your life...

40:38.556 --> 40:41.993
It tends to stay open.

40:42.060 --> 40:44.262
It does, doesn't it?

40:48.735 --> 40:50.636
So what do you do now?

40:50.703 --> 40:53.072
Now?

40:53.139 --> 40:55.274
Things go back to normal,
I guess.

40:55.341 --> 40:56.407
<i>Normal.</i>

40:56.475 --> 40:58.342
What exactly is normal?

40:58.410 --> 41:00.511
I have no idea.

41:00.579 --> 41:01.913
Here's an idea.

41:01.980 --> 41:04.082
Why don't you
fix the Charger?

41:04.150 --> 41:05.550
This?
Oh, no. No, no.

41:05.617 --> 41:08.386
This is <i>beyond</i> saving.

41:08.454 --> 41:13.224
<i>Nothing</i> is beyond saving
if you work at it.

41:13.291 --> 41:16.160
Nothing.

41:16.227 --> 41:18.963
Besides, then I could have
my garage back.

41:20.642 --> 41:21.842
Want anything?
