YOU JUST SCRATCH
THE LITTLE SQUARES ON THE MENU

12:21.198 --> 12:23.868
AND ORDER YOUR FOOD
BY HOW IT SMELLS.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.162
MAN, I WISH OUR WAITRESS

14:07.846 --> 14:10.266
IT'S CHANGED THE WAY YOU LIVE.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.269
AND NOW YOU PRETEND
IT DOESN'T EXIST?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.396
WHAT, JUST 'CAUSE

14:15.479 --> 14:17.314
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.607
YOU NEED HELP.

14:18.691 --> 14:23.112
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM,
