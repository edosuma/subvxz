03:02.967 --> 03:05.533
-YEAH, THE CAR TURNED AROUND
ON THE CHECKPOINT.

03:05.633 --> 03:07.500
-I WASN'T IN THE CAR!
-WE FIGURED THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED,

03:07.600 --> 03:11.200
'CAUSE THEY FLEW PAST,
AND BECAUSE OF THE WET SURFACE,

03:11.300 --> 03:13.200
WE KNEW THEY WEREN'T GOING
TO NEGOTIATE THE TURN,

03:13.300 --> 03:15.867

03:16.867 --> 03:19.567

-DID YOU SEE
BOTH OF THESE GUYS

03:25.967 --> 03:27.067
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.567
-MAN, I WAS NOT IN--
I WAS NOT THE DRIVER.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.700
-Man on radio: YOU'RE GOOD.
-YEAH, I THINK WE HAVE
A THIRD GUY

03:31.800 --> 03:34.933
WITH A WHITE T-SHIRT, BUT--
-I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.967
-I WAS NOT THE DRIVER.
I WAS NOT IN THE CAR.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.467
-WHEN YOU TURNED AROUND
AT THAT CHECKPOINT

03:39.567 --> 03:41.100
AND YOU STARTED GOING
THE OTHER WAY,

03:41.200 --> 03:42.833
YOU DROVE RIGHT PAST ME.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.533
I LOOKED AT YOU,
AND YOU LOOKED AT ME.

03:44.633 --> 03:47.233
-YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT ME,
'CAUSE I WASN'T IN NOBODY'S CAR.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.533
-LET'S WALK DOWN HERE.
-I WAS NOT IN NOBODY'S CAR, MAN.

03:49.633 --> 03:51.933
-Man on radio:
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
-NOW YOU'VE GOT TWO...

03:52.067 --> 03:53.600
-YOU'VE GOT A TURN-AROUND.
-...TWO GUNS.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.300
SO THIS IS THE CAR
THAT ELUDED THE CHECKPOINT,

03:56.400 --> 03:59.667
WRECKED INTO THE CONCRETE HERE,
THEN THEY TOOK OFF RUNNING.

03:59.767 --> 04:01.900
WE'VE GOT AN IGNITION
INTERLOCK DEVICE,

04:02.067 --> 04:04.467
WHICH MEANS THIS PERSON'S
A PRIOR OFFENDER

04:04.567 --> 04:06.333
FOR DRIVING
WHILE INTOXICATED.

04:06.433 --> 04:09.800
AND WE'VE GOT
A COUPLE OF WEAPONS
IN THE VEHICLE AS WELL.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.500
9mm BERETTA,
FULLY LOADED WITH A MAGAZINE.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.300
IT WAS FOUND

FLOORBOARD HERE.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.333
AND WE'VE GOT A KEL-TEC
556 SEMI-AUTOMATIC--

04:21.433 --> 04:23.300
ALMOST LIKE A RIFLE OF SORTS,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.733
BUT IT'S BEEN CHOPPED DOWN.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.900
THIS IS A VERY DEADLY GUN.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.700
WE'VE GOT
AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF 1800--

04:30.800 --> 04:33.400
WELL, IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF BEVERAGE IN THERE STILL.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.700
1800 TEQUILA.
-(radio chatter)

04:35.800 --> 04:38.533
-Dispatcher: HE'S CHECKING
SOME OF THE NUMBERS,
OFFICERS WANT TO KNOW REFERENCE.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.567
-I'M GETTING SOME INFORMATION
BACK FROM OUR DISPATCHER.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.333
SO, OUR DRIVER,
HE'S GOT A WARRANT
OUT OF OUR CITY

04:44.433 --> 04:46.567
FOR MALICIOUS DESTRUCTION
OF PROPERTY.

04:46.667 --> 04:47.967
ONE OF THE GUNS
WE FOUND IN THE CAR

04:48.067 --> 04:50.233
HAS RESPONDED BACK
STOLEN OUT OF GRANDVIEW.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.067
WE'LL GO AHEAD
AND RECOVER 'EM BOTH.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.067
LET'S TALK TO THE PASSENGER.

04:54.167 --> 04:56.500
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

04:56.600 --> 04:58.533
-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON.

04:58.633 --> 05:01.700
I WAS AT MAX'S BAR.
TERRY HAD BEEN THERE EARLIER.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.067
TERRY HAD TO LEAVE,
AND HE SAYS, "I'LL BE BACK
TO PICK YOU UP."

05:05.167 --> 05:07.467
I SAID, "OKAY."
WELL, I'M CALLING,

05:07.567 --> 05:09.700
"DUDE, I'M ALMOST
OUT OF MONEY, MAN.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.300
"WHERE YOU AT?
I WANNA GO HOME!"

05:11.400 --> 05:12.800
"I'M AROUND THE CORNER."

05:12.900 --> 05:15.067
SO HE COME
AND PICK ME UP AT MAX'S,

05:15.133 --> 05:17.067
I GET IN THE CAR, DIDN'T THINK
NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

05:17.133 --> 05:19.400
THEN I GET IN THE CAR,
AND I CAN SMELL ALCOHOL.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.233

"WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

05:39.233 --> 05:41.633
HE STARTS WALKING DOWN,
"DUDE, WHERE'S THE COPS?"

05:41.733 --> 05:43.500
-YOU WANT AN AMBULANCE
TO COME UP HERE
AND CHECK YOU OUT?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.767
-NO, I'M JUST TRIPPING

05:45.867 --> 05:48.233
I'M IN A CAR WITH GUNS.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.233
-IS ONE OF THEM YOURS?
-NO! I DON'T--

05:50.333 --> 05:52.200

06:07.900 --> 06:10.100
-NO, I AIN'T GOT NO WARRANTS.
-WELL, YOU DO.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.867
-Terry: WHAT AM I GOING
TO JAIL FOR?

06:11.967 --> 06:13.567
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.533
I AIN'T GOT STOLEN PROPERTY.
I GOT MY BEST--

06:16.633 --> 06:19.100

-(radio chatter)

06:21.100 --> 06:24.267
-I WASN'T DRIVING.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.500
-WE'VE GOT AN OFFICER

06:26.600 --> 06:29.567
-IT'S BETWEEN YOU

-I'M NOT DRIVING.

06:30.733 --> 06:32.600
-DID YOU KNOW
THERE WAS GUNS IN THAT CAR?

06:32.700 --> 06:34.333
-I DIDN'T HAVE
NO GUNS IN NO CAR.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.167
I WAS NOT DRINKING
AND DRIVING.

06:36.267 --> 06:38.700
-OKAY.
-I WAS NOT DRIVING, OFFICER.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.133
-ALL RIGHT, STEP UP,

08:18.433 --> 08:20.400
WE ACTUALLY JUST

08:20.500 --> 08:22.367
THEIR CAR HAD BROKEN DOWN,

08:22.467 --> 08:24.167
AND SO THEY CALLED US
FOR A RIDE.

08:24.267 --> 08:26.233
THE OTHER RIDE

08:26.333 --> 08:28.500
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

08:28.600 --> 08:30.067
JUST BECAUSE OF THE AREA

08:30.100 --> 08:33.333
WE ALWAYS HAVE A K-9 COME OUT,
JUST DO A QUICK OPEN-AIR SWEEP.

08:33.433 --> 08:36.067

-WE WERE HANGING OUT
WITH OUR FRIEND JAKE, AND WE
WENT AND GOT SOME McDONALD'S.

08:51.933 --> 08:54.067
THEY LIVE DOWN IN THIS AREA.
THEY JUST MOVED.
-MM-HMM.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.833
HE AND I WERE WITH THEM
AND THEIR CAR WOULDN'T START.

08:56.933 --> 08:59.600
AND IT WAS KIND OF
A SKETCHY AREA.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.333
-THIS GENTLEMAN HERE
CAME AND PICKED Y'ALL UP.

09:01.433 --> 09:02.767
-YEAH, TAYLOR CAME
AND PICKED US UP.
-OKAY.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.833
SO THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL
IN THE CAR?

09:04.933 --> 09:06.933
-NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF.
-NOBODY HAS ANYTHING ON 'EM?

09:07.067 --> 09:09.367
-I JUST MET THESE TWO,
I'VE KNOWN TAYLOR
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

09:09.467 --> 09:12.367
-MM-HMM.
-AND... THAT'S IT, YOU KNOW?

09:12.467 --> 09:14.900
-I'M GONNA SEND HER UP.
SEND ME TAYLOR BACK.

09:15.933 --> 09:17.833
ALL RIGHT, JUST REAL QUICK,
I WANTED TO FINISH UP WITH YOU.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.500
-K-9's HERE.
-OKAY.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.700
-JUST GONNA DO
A SWEEP OF EVERYTHING, OKAY?

09:21.800 --> 09:23.500
SO, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
IN THERE I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT,

09:23.600 --> 09:25.500
LET ME KNOW NOW.
NOTHING IN THERE?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.867
-NOPE.
-ALL RIGHT, HANG TIGHT
WITH HIM REAL QUICK.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.900
-WELL, THIS WAS
SITTING LIKE THIS...

09:31.067 --> 09:32.733
-OKAY.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.900
-SHE DEFINITELY ALERTED?
-OH YEAH.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.733
-OKAY.
-IF YOU WANNA GRAB THAT...

09:36.833 --> 09:38.500
-YEAH, I'LL SET IT UP ON--

09:38.600 --> 09:40.767
SHE WON'T ALERT
ON THE NEEDLE UNLESS THERE'S

09:40.867 --> 09:42.433
SOME SORT OF RESIDUE ON IT.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.167
THERE'S RESIDUE IN THERE.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.200
-HEY.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.333
-WAS THAT PURSE UP FRONT?
-NO, IT WAS IN THE BACK.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.633
-THERE'S A PIECE--
NEEDLE CAPS IN THERE.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.067
THERE IT IS.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.933
WHAT WE GOT?

10:02.033 --> 10:04.367
LOOKS LIKE SOME HEROIN RESIDUE.

10:04.467 --> 10:05.733
WE'VE GOT NEEDLE CAPS...

10:07.767 --> 10:10.233
MORE RESIDUE
DOWN IN THE BAG HERE.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.200
-HONESTLY, I THINK
THEY JUST SPRINKLED IT OUT.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.900
IT WAS RIGHT ON THE RIGHT SIDE
ON THE FLOORBOARD.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.900
THERE'S JUST RESIDUE OVER THERE.
THEY PROBABLY OPENED IT,
SPRINKLED IT OUT.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.700
-YOU WEREN'T COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH ME HERE.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.333
WE FOUND SYRINGES.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.700
-WELL, LOOK...
-I KNOW YOU'RE NERVOUS.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.667
-THE PEOPLE THAT WE PICKED UP...
-MM-HMM.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.267
-...THEY WERE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

10:30.367 --> 10:33.800
SO... THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS.
-THE OTHER MALE--

10:33.900 --> 10:35.167
-THE OTHER COUPLE.
-OTHER COUPLE?

10:35.267 --> 10:37.500
-YEAH, THAT'S WHO WE PICKED UP.
-OKAY.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.967

10:40.067 --> 10:43.033
-COME HERE, MA'AM.

10:43.133 --> 10:45.233
I DON'T KNOW IF OFFICER KANE
EXPLAINED TO YOU

10:45.333 --> 10:47.767
WE FOUND BAGGIES WITH RESIDUE,

10:47.867 --> 10:50.033
SYRINGES,
ALL THAT GOOD STUFF,

10:50.133 --> 10:51.267
RIGHT WHERE
Y'ALL WERE SITTING.

10:51.367 --> 10:55.600
-YEAH. I THINK THAT
IT'S THE GUY AND THE GIRL'S.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.767
-YOU THINK IT'S THEIRS?
-YEAH.

10:57.867 --> 10:59.400
-WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S THEIRS?

10:59.500 --> 11:03.467
-THEY MUST'VE PICKED THEM UP
IN THE FRICKING GHETTO?

11:03.567 --> 11:06.800
-OKAY.
-AND, LIKE,
THEY WERE FREAKING OUT

11:06.900 --> 11:09.400
WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE PULLING US OVER,
LIKE, "WE'RE GOING TO JAIL."

11:09.500 --> 11:11.433
-MM-HMM. OKAY.

11:11.533 --> 11:15.133
SO, WHO DO YOU THINK
HAS IT ON 'EM? HER?

11:15.233 --> 11:17.100
WHERE? DID YOU SEE HER
PUT IT SOMEWHERE?

11:18.633 --> 11:21.300
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE A SEAT FOR ME.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.833
-YES, SIR.

ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.600
WE KNOW THAT
YOU HAVE IT ON YOU...
-WHY?

11:31.700 --> 11:33.467
-...SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA--
LISTEN TO ME.
-OKAY.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.100
-SO WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO NOW IS

11:35.200 --> 11:36.967
EITHER I CAN HAVE
A FEMALE OFFICER COME OUT HERE

11:37.067 --> 11:38.967
AND IN PRIVATE
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO HER

11:39.067 --> 11:41.167
OR YOU CAN RETRIEVE IT YOURSELF.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.633
IT'S YOUR DECISION.
-OKAY.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.400
-I APPRECIATE YOU FINALLY
MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION

11:51.500 --> 11:53.600
AND LETTING US
GO ON ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.367
-THE... COUPLE THAT I MET...

11:56.467 --> 11:58.133
-MM-HMM.
-...HANDED ME THIS.

11:58.233 --> 11:59.233
-OKAY.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.767
-THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING.

12:01.867 --> 12:03.533
-WELL, I WOULD RATHER DO THIS...

12:03.633 --> 12:06.833
-YEAH.
-...THAN GO THROUGH THE HASSLE
OF THE OTHER WAY

12:06.933 --> 12:09.533
AND HAVING SOMEBODY ELSE
RETRIEVE IT FOR YOU, YOU KNOW.
-YEAH. YEAH.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.700
-IT'S IN TINFOIL,
SO I'M GUESSING IT'S COCAINE.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.167
BUT IT COULD BE HEROIN.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.267
THE SMALL, LITTLE BAGGIES

12:16.367 --> 12:18.600
ARE GONNA BE
YOUR HEROIN RESIDUE.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.300
WE'RE GONNA TEST IT.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.533
-EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE CAR WHEN WE STARTED
TO PULL YOU OVER.

12:22.633 --> 12:25.900
-EVERYTHING WAS HIDDEN.
EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW,

12:26.067 --> 12:29.100
THAT HAD ANYTHING
HANDED ME WHAT THEY HAD.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.100
-AND YOU DID WHAT WITH IT?
-I PUT IT IN MY PANTS.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.900
-PUT IT IN YOUR PANTS.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

12:35.067 --> 12:37.567
BAD DECISION.
-VERY BAD DECISION.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.900
-OKAY. SOMETIMES YOU NEED
TO SEPARATE YOURSELF

12:40.067 --> 12:42.767
FROM THEM, OKAY, SO YOU DON'T--
-HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING...

12:42.867 --> 12:45.467
-SO YOU DON'T GET IN TROUBLE.
-...AT ALL ABOUT HIS THING?

12:45.567 --> 12:47.700
-NO, NOBODY TOLD US
ANYTHING ELSE.

12:49.067 --> 12:52.700
YOU'RE GONNA BE ARRESTED FOR
THE POSSESSION OF HEROIN, OKAY?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.167
-ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
OBVIOUSLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:55.267 --> 12:56.533
SHE'S GONNA TAKE THE RAP,

12:56.633 --> 12:58.833
BUT YOU GUYS ARE
ALL DOWN HERE AS A TEAM.

12:58.933 --> 13:03.200
THERE'S TWO STRAWS,
ENOUGH HEROIN FOR MORE
THAN ONE PERSON.

13:03.300 --> 13:06.967
SHE'S GONNA DO THIS TONIGHT,
AND YOU GUYS ARE JUST
GONNA GO HOME FREE.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.833
-JOSH, RAY-BANS.
DON'T FORGET THOSE.

13:09.933 --> 13:13.067
-YOU WERE IN THE BACK.
-Man: YEAH, I PUT 'EM ASIDE...
(mumbles)

13:13.133 --> 13:16.900
-OKAY.
-LIKE I SAID,
THIS IS A LIFE LESSON.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.233
YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER BEEN
LOCKED UP FOR THIS BEFORE,

13:19.333 --> 13:21.400
SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO JUST
SEPARATE YOURSELF

13:21.500 --> 13:23.467
FROM CERTAIN PEOPLE SO
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, OKAY?

13:27.067 --> 13:28.433
-Sr. Deputy Thompson:
HERE IN RICHLAND COUNTY,

13:28.533 --> 13:30.067
JUST AS IT IS IN ANY
COMMUNITY IN ANY STATE,

13:30.100 --> 13:33.600
YOU ARE GONNA HAVE
A SUBSECTION OF PEOPLE
WHO JUST DON'T LIKE COPS.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.867
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
IS EVERYBODY IS HUMAN

13:35.967 --> 13:37.933
AND EVERYBODY
NEEDS US AT SOME POINT.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.800
AND AT THAT POINT THEY REALIZE

13:39.900 --> 13:42.100
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
HERE IN RICHLAND COUNTY

13:42.200 --> 13:44.633
IS THE BEST PLACE FOR THEM
TO GO TO GET THAT HELP.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.867
-(siren chirps)
-ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT
A BLACK B.M.W.

13:49.967 --> 13:54.100
WE OBSERVED MAKE A HAND-TO-HAND
TRANSACTION ABOUT A MILE BACK.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.267
POTENTIAL DRUG DEAL.

13:56.367 --> 13:59.433
9-1-9, STOPPING ON WINDOVER.

13:59.533 --> 14:01.067

THAT COULD BE BAD.
YOU GOT I.D. ON YOU, BOSS?

14:22.100 --> 14:24.733
-IT'S IN THE HOUSE.
-IT'S AT THE HOUSE?
YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON YOU?

14:24.833 --> 14:27.067
-Y'ALL MAKING
A TRAFFIC STOP, RIGHT?

14:27.167 --> 14:29.700
-RIGHT, BUT I NEED TO IDENTIFY
EVERYBODY INSIDE THE VEHICLE.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.800

14:31.900 --> 14:33.600
-NO, SIR.

14:37.767 --> 14:39.533
-NO, I WAS NOT EVEN SPEEDING!

14:39.633 --> 14:42.600
I ACTUALLY BEEN BRAKING BECAUSE
THERE'S POTHOLES IN THE ROAD!

14:42.700 --> 14:44.267
I DON'T WANT 'EM

14:44.367 --> 14:45.833
-RUN HIM REAL QUICK FOR ME.

14:45.933 --> 14:47.567

-I UNDERSTAND.
JUST STEP BACK HERE

BACK, BACK, BACK.
I DON'T WANT YOU
ON THE ROAD HERE.

14:56.467 --> 15:00.300
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT TODAY?
-NO! I WAS NOT SPEEDING AT ALL!

15:00.400 --> 15:01.933
-I DIDN'T SAY
THAT YOU WERE SPEEDING.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.867
IF YOU WERE TO GIVE ME AN
OPPORTUNITY, I COULD TELL YOU.
-OKAY, OKAY.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.833
-I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CATCH UP

15:05.933 --> 15:08.933
BECAUSE YOU WERE

15:09.067 --> 15:10.633
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

15:10.733 --> 15:12.600
-I WAS ON THE PHONE

16:14.367 --> 16:16.933
-THANK YOU.
-I HOPE HE DON'T
TEAR THE SEAT UP,

16:17.067 --> 16:18.267
'CAUSE THAT'S
GONNA BE A LAWSUIT.

16:18.367 --> 16:20.767
-THE DOG JUST INDICATED
POSITIVELY INSIDE THE VEHICLE,

16:20.867 --> 16:23.800
DIRECTED TOWARDS
THE PASSENGER SEAT.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.667
I'D REALLY LIKE YOU
TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.167
DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING ILLEGAL ON YOU?

16:27.267 --> 16:29.400
AND WHEN I SAY "ON YOU,"

16:29.500 --> 16:31.167
I DON'T MEAN IN YOUR POCKETS.

16:31.267 --> 16:33.233
I'M TALKING ABOUT

I HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE.
IF I HAVE TO DO WHAT
I NEED TO DO--

16:38.633 --> 16:40.900
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT DOG.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.367
I HAVE PROBABLY CAUSE

16:42.467 --> 16:44.133
-YOU DON'T HAVE
NO PROBABLY CAUSE.
-NO, I DO.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.533
-YOU DO NOT, SIR.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.700
TURN THIS WAY.
KEEP YOUR HANDS

16:54.800 --> 16:56.600
-Woman: THIS IS CRAZY!

16:56.700 --> 16:58.467
-YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT, SIR.
