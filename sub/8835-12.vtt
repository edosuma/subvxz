WEBVTT

01:09.904 --> 01:13.283
Laura: PA DIDN'T Go AWAY
VERY OFTEN, BUT WHEN HE DID,

01:13.450 --> 01:16.703
IT TOOK ALL OF US WORKING
TOGETHER TO GET HIM READY.

01:16.870 --> 01:20.415
HE WAS ONLY GOING TO BE GONE 3
WEEKS TO MANKATO AND OTHER PLACES

01:20.582 --> 01:22.125
ON ERRANDS FOR MR. HANSON,

01:22.292 --> 01:26.004
WITH MR. EDWARDS TO HELP HIM
AND KEEP HIM COMPANY.

01:26.171 --> 01:28.798
BUT PA SAID
WHEN IT CAME TO LEAVING HOME,

01:28.965 --> 01:32.594
IT TOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE PUSHING
TO GET HIM STARTED.

01:36.181 --> 01:38.725
Laura: GOOD-BYE, PA!
GOOD-BYE, MR. EDWARDS.

01:38.892 --> 01:41.603
Mary: BYE.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

01:46.441 --> 01:48.193
GOOD-BYE, MR. EDWARDS!

01:48.359 --> 01:49.444
BYE, PA.

01:49.611 --> 01:52.363
Carrie:
GOOD-BYE, PAPA.

01:52.530 --> 01:56.075
Ma: ALL RIGHT, GIRLS, YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

01:56.242 --> 01:57.869
WE'LL HURRY, MA.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.090
LAURA, WILL
YOU COME ON?

02:11.257 --> 02:12.592
WE'LL BE LATE
FOR SURE.

02:12.759 --> 02:14.302
I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING.

02:14.469 --> 02:15.261
WHAT?

02:15.428 --> 02:16.554
I DON'T KNOW.

02:16.721 --> 02:19.140
WELL, HOW CAN YOU BE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

02:19.307 --> 02:21.267
IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE SOMETHING IS?

02:21.434 --> 02:22.560
I'LL KNOW IT
WHEN I SEE IT.

02:22.727 --> 02:25.063
LAURA, SOMETIMES YOU
DON'T MAKE SENSE.

02:25.230 --> 02:26.189
COME ON.

02:26.356 --> 02:29.609
OK, I'M COMING.

02:29.776 --> 02:31.694
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU
DON'T MAKE SENSE, EITHER.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.238
WHEN DON'T I?

02:33.404 --> 02:36.366
EVERY MORNING YOU'RE ALWAYS
IN A HURRY TO GET TO SCHOOL.

02:36.533 --> 02:37.700
WELL, I LIKE SCHOOL.

02:37.867 --> 02:41.329
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
YOU DON'T MAKE SENSE.

02:50.046 --> 02:51.673
COME ON, LAURA.

02:59.055 --> 02:59.973
HURRY UP!

03:00.139 --> 03:01.474
Miss Beadle:
NOW, AS YOU ALL CAN SEE,

03:01.641 --> 03:03.309
I'VE WRITTEN
"SCHOLARSHIP AWARD."

03:03.476 --> 03:04.477
SHH!

03:04.644 --> 03:07.188
YES, GIRLS. COME IN.

03:13.152 --> 03:14.153
Miss Beadle:
YOU'RE LATE.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.030
YES, MA'AM.
I'M SORRY.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.576
IT WAS MY FAULT. I WAS
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.828
WELL, I HOPE
YOU FOUND IT.

03:21.995 --> 03:23.830
THANK YOU,
MISS BEADLE.

03:23.997 --> 03:26.749
NOW, I'VE WRITTEN "SCHOLARSHIP
AWARD" ON THE BLACKBOARD.

03:26.916 --> 03:30.086
AS YOU ALL KNOW, EACH
YEAR AN AWARD IS GIVEN

03:30.253 --> 03:32.672
TO THE STUDENT WHO
SCORES THE HIGHEST GRADE

03:32.839 --> 03:34.048
IN A SPECIAL
EXAMINATION.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.176
NOW, IN THE YEARS PAST,
THE AWARD HAS BEEN A RIBBON,

03:37.343 --> 03:42.348
BUT THIS YEAR THE SCHOOL BOARD
HAS MADE A GENEROUS DONATION,

03:42.515 --> 03:44.684
AND THIS WILL BE THE AWARD.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.063
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.274
[STUDENTS MURMUR AGREEMENT]

03:51.441 --> 03:53.693
IT'S A LOVELY
WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY.

03:53.860 --> 03:57.697
NOW, I WILL SUPPLY ANY STUDENT
WHO WISHES TO ENTER THE CONTEST

03:57.864 --> 04:00.450

04:00.617 --> 04:06.039
WITH A LOVELY AWARD LIKE THIS, I'M SURE
WE'LL HAVE MORE ENTRIES THAN EVER BEFORE.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.042
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'LL GET ON
WITH TODAY'S WORK.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.835
I'VE CORRECTED
YOUR SPELLING PAPERS,

04:11.002 --> 04:15.632
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO WRITE THE
WORDS THAT YOU MISSED 25 TIMES.

04:15.798 --> 04:16.591

04:18.009 --> 04:19.385

04:19.552 --> 04:20.762

04:29.729 --> 04:31.898

04:32.065 --> 04:32.982
WHOEVER WINS

04:33.149 --> 04:35.193
IS REALLY GOING
TO DESERVE IT,

04:35.360 --> 04:38.029
WITH THIS LIST
OF SUBJECTS.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.781
I'VE GOT 3 WEEKS
TO DO IT.

04:39.948 --> 04:42.325
I'VE JUST GOT
TO WIN.

04:42.492 --> 04:45.912
MARY, A LOT OF THE STUDENTS
ARE OLDER THAN YOU ARE,

04:46.079 --> 04:47.956
AND THEY'LL ALL
BE TRYING TO WIN.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.292
PA SAYS YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IF
YOU JUST SET YOUR MIND TO IT.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.627
THAT'S TRUE, BUT--

04:52.794 --> 04:54.253
WELL, I'VE SET
MY MIND TO IT.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.964
I WANT TO BE A SCHOOLTEACHER
LIKE YOU WERE,

04:56.130 --> 04:57.924
AND I'LL NEED
A DICTIONARY.

04:58.091 --> 05:00.343
I'M GONNA GO
UPSTAIRS AND STUDY.

05:02.178 --> 05:04.597
I'LL WIN IT.
YOU'LL SEE.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.227
MA?

05:09.394 --> 05:10.728
MM-HMM?

05:10.895 --> 05:13.106
DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL WIN?

05:13.272 --> 05:15.525
I KNOW SHE'LL DO
HER BEST.

05:17.193 --> 05:19.195
WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON?

05:19.362 --> 05:21.114

05:21.280 --> 05:24.659
I HAVE TO WRITE DOWN EVERY
WORD I MISSED 25 TIMES.

05:24.826 --> 05:26.619
HMM. HOW MANY DID YOU MISS?

05:28.204 --> 05:29.622
A FEW.

05:35.003 --> 05:38.131
HOW DO YOU SPELL "BO," [RHYMES
WITH "NO"] LIKE ON A TREE?

05:38.297 --> 05:39.632
YOU MEAN BOUGH
[RHYMES WITH "COW"]?

05:39.799 --> 05:41.050
BOUGH.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.805

05:45.972 --> 05:47.348

05:49.684 --> 05:51.602

05:51.769 --> 05:54.647
"O-U-G-H."

05:54.814 --> 05:58.317
"O-U-G-H."

06:00.153 --> 06:01.195
IF MARY WINS
THAT DICTIONARY,

06:01.362 --> 06:03.156
PRETTY SOON YOU
WON'T HAVE TO ASK.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.116
YOU CAN LOOK
THE WORDS UP.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.249
HOW CAN I LOOK UP
A WORD I CAN'T SPELL?

06:33.644 --> 06:34.645
MISS BEADLE?

06:34.812 --> 06:36.022
YES, MARY?

06:36.189 --> 06:37.523
I'M HAVING TROUBLE FINDING
SOME OF THE THINGS

06:37.690 --> 06:39.525
I NEED TO KNOW
FOR THE EXAMINATION.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.027
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

06:41.194 --> 06:45.865

BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

06:46.032 --> 06:49.952
MM-HMM. I THINK
I CAN HELP YOU.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.043
THIS HELPED ME,
MARY.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.878
I'M SURE IT CAN
HELP YOU.

06:59.045 --> 07:00.505
OH, THANK YOU.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.548
I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF
YOUR BOOK, MISS BEADLE.

07:02.715 --> 07:03.716
OH, I KNOW YOU WILL.

07:03.883 --> 07:04.842
BYE.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.385
BYE, MARY.

07:19.190 --> 07:20.650
MARY, WOULD YOU
QUIT POKING?

07:20.817 --> 07:21.818
WE GOT CHORES TO DO.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.028
I'M NOT POKING.
I'M READING.

07:24.195 --> 07:25.613
WHAT ARE YOU
READING ABOUT?

07:25.780 --> 07:26.781
HISTORY.

07:26.948 --> 07:27.698
YUCK.

07:27.865 --> 07:28.991
I LIKE HISTORY.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.869
I DON'T. IT'S ALL
ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.705
YUCK.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.750

07:49.762 --> 07:50.972
HI, MA.

07:51.139 --> 07:53.182
HI. YOU'RE LATE. DID YOU
HAVE TO STAY AFTER SCHOOL?

07:53.349 --> 07:54.600
CLOSE THE DOOR.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.018
NO, MA. IT WAS
MARY'S FAULT.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.146
SHE WAS READING
ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.522
WHAT?

07:59.689 --> 08:01.983
LOOK WHAT MISS BEADLE GAVE ME.

08:02.150 --> 08:03.734
OH, MY.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.405
SHE GAVE IT
TO YOU?

08:07.572 --> 08:09.365
NO. SHE JUST
LET ME USE IT

08:09.532 --> 08:11.450
TO HELP ME STUDY
FOR THE EXAMINATION.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.953
OH. I KNOW YOU'LL
TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.454
I PROMISED.

08:15.621 --> 08:16.998
GOOD FOR YOU.

08:17.165 --> 08:18.332
MA?

08:18.499 --> 08:19.542
MM-HMM?

08:19.709 --> 08:21.335
SINCE I DON'T HAVE
ANY HOMEWORK,

08:21.502 --> 08:23.296
CAN I GO FISHING
AFTER I DO MY CHORES?

08:23.462 --> 08:24.881
WELL, JUST BECAUSE YOU
DON'T HAVE ANY HOMEWORK

08:25.047 --> 08:26.424
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T SPEND

08:26.591 --> 08:28.009
A LITTLE EXTRA
TIME LEARNING.

08:28.176 --> 08:28.968
YES, MA.

08:29.135 --> 08:30.469
WHEN I'M DEAD,

08:30.636 --> 08:33.472
THE HISTORY BOOK WILL SAY I
HARDLY EVER GOT TO GO FISHING.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.266
CLOSE THE DOOR.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.501
MARY, WOULD YOU PLEASE
BLOW OUT THAT LIGHT?

09:02.668 --> 09:04.170
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITH IT ON.

09:04.337 --> 09:06.172
WELL, I CAN'T READ
WITHOUT IT.

09:06.339 --> 09:07.465
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE READING.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.091
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE SLEEPING.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.426
I CAN'T SLEEP.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.844
MA NEEDS HER REST

09:12.011 --> 09:14.347
WITH ALL THE EXTRA WORK SHE
HAS TO DO WITH PA GONE.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.225
I KNOW, BUT I'M
IN A REAL GOOD PART

09:17.391 --> 09:18.684
ABOUT
GEORGE WASHINGTON.

09:18.851 --> 09:20.186
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:20.353 --> 09:22.313
HE GOT TO BE THE FATHER
OF OUR COUNTRY.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.358
NOW BLOW OUT THAT LIGHT
BEFORE IT WAKES UP MA.

14:43.175 --> 14:46.178
I'M--I'M SO SORRY, MA.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.264
SORRY IS NOT ENOUGH.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.018
Ma: I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.729
I MUST HAVE
FALLEN ASLEEP...

14:57.022 --> 14:58.899
TIPPED THE LANTERN
OVER. I--

14:59.066 --> 15:02.152
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

15:04.613 --> 15:06.240
I WAS STUDYING...

15:07.950 --> 15:09.577
FOR THE EXAMINATION.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.204
YOU HAVE A WHOLE
HOUSE TO STUDY IN,

15:12.371 --> 15:13.956
AND YOU HAD TO
COME OUT HERE?

15:15.499 --> 15:18.711
MA, I DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE YOU. I--l--

15:18.877 --> 15:22.756
DO YOU REALIZE YOU
COULD HAVE BEEN--

15:26.885 --> 15:28.637
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU

15:28.804 --> 15:31.515
NOT TO LIGHT MATCHES OR
LANTERNS IN THE BARN?!

15:35.603 --> 15:37.313
HUNDREDS,
I GUESS. I--

15:37.479 --> 15:40.399
BUT YOU FORGOT!

15:40.566 --> 15:43.402
WELL, YOUNG LADY, YOU'RE GONNA
REMEMBER FROM THIS NIGHT ON!

15:43.569 --> 15:46.655
AND YOU CAN FORGET
THAT EXAMINATION.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.158
NOW, TOMORROW MORNING
I WANT YOU TO GO IN

15:49.325 --> 15:51.577
AND TELL MISS BEADLE THAT
YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT.

15:51.744 --> 15:52.745
BUT, MA,
SHE CAN'T.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.747
WHY NOT?!

15:54.913 --> 15:56.206
BECAUSE TOMORROW'S SATURDAY.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.167
WELL, MONDAY, THEN.

15:58.334 --> 16:00.919
NOW GO ON TO BED!

16:01.086 --> 16:02.463
BOTH OF YOU!

16:26.236 --> 16:27.905
9 EGGS THIS MORNING.

16:28.072 --> 16:31.116
WITH THE 9 YOU HAD, THAT'S
A DOZEN AND A HALF.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.576
THANK YOU.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.495
MARY?

16:37.623 --> 16:41.043
WOULD YOU SIT
DOWN, PLEASE?

16:52.930 --> 16:54.306
MARY, I WANT
YOU TO KNOW

16:54.473 --> 16:56.433
I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED
LAST NIGHT...

16:58.394 --> 17:01.188
HORRIBLY FRIGHTENED.

17:01.355 --> 17:04.191
I'M VERY SORRY, MA.

17:05.734 --> 17:11.031
WELL, IF THE BARN BURNED--THE
SPARKS-- THE HOUSE.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.578
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I WAS SO HARSH--

17:16.745 --> 17:18.747
BECAUSE I WAS
FRIGHTENED.

17:18.914 --> 17:20.541
YES, MA'AM.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.920
CAN I GO NOW?

17:25.087 --> 17:30.884
I WANT TO RAKE UP ALL THE BURNT
STRAW AND THE PIECES OF SACK.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.808
CAN I GO?
PLEASE, MA?

17:40.018 --> 17:41.603
OF COURSE.

18:28.692 --> 18:31.236
MOST TROUBLES ARE NOT
AS BLACK AS THEY SEEM

18:31.403 --> 18:32.738
WHEN YOU PULL THEM
INTO THE SUNSHINE

18:32.905 --> 18:35.282
AND TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT THEM.

18:35.449 --> 18:37.785
BEFORE I FORGET...

18:37.951 --> 18:41.038
I RAN INTO CHARLES AND MR.
EDWARDS ON MY WAY HERE--

18:41.205 --> 18:45.918
NEAR NEW ULM. THEY WERE
CAMPED ASIDE OF THE ROAD.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.629
CHARLES SENT
HIS LOVE.

18:50.339 --> 18:52.424
THANK YOU.

18:53.967 --> 18:57.095
NOW, AFTER THE FIRE, YOU
SENT THE GIRLS TO BED,

18:57.262 --> 18:59.807
AND YOU TOLD MARY SHE COULDN'T
TAKE THE EXAMINATION?

19:01.099 --> 19:02.810
I DID MORE THAN THAT.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.853
I LOST MY TEMPER,

19:05.020 --> 19:08.732
AND I NEVER LOSE MY
TEMPER WITH MY GIRLS.

19:09.608 --> 19:10.859
THERE ARE FEW
AMONG US

19:11.026 --> 19:13.111
WHO HAVEN'T SAID OR DONE
SOMETHING WE REGRET.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.073
DID MARY SAY
SHE WAS SORRY?

19:16.240 --> 19:18.659
OH, SEVERAL TIMES,
BUT I WAS SO UPSET,

19:18.826 --> 19:20.786
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

19:20.953 --> 19:21.829
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN--

19:21.995 --> 19:24.122
SHE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN KILLED...

19:24.289 --> 19:26.291
BUT SHE WASN'T.

19:27.459 --> 19:30.546
THAT'S ONE WORRY
BEHIND YOU.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.966
LET'S TALK ABOUT
TODAY, THIS MORNING.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.136
WELL, I TRIED
TO TALK TO MARY.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.806
WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO TELL HER?

19:40.973 --> 19:42.391
THAT YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND,

19:42.558 --> 19:45.269
THERE WASN'T GOING TO
BE ANY PUNISHMENT?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.229
SOMETHING LIKE THAT...

19:48.355 --> 19:50.315
BUT I DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE.

19:51.567 --> 19:52.776
WHY NOT?

19:57.489 --> 19:59.241
SHE WAS LIKE
A STRANGER.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.785
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT ME.

20:01.952 --> 20:05.163
SHE JUST KEPT SAYING
SHE UNDERSTOOD

20:05.330 --> 20:09.877
AND THAT SHE HAD WORK TO DO
AND ASKING IF SHE COULD GO.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.169
WHAT KIND OF WORK?

20:11.336 --> 20:13.338
CLEANING UP
IN THE BARN.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.383
HAD YOU TOLD HER
TO DO THAT?

20:18.010 --> 20:19.720
NO. IT WAS HER OWN IDEA.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.057
DOESN'T THAT SAY
QUITE A LOT?

20:26.184 --> 20:28.186
SHE'S ACCEPTED
THE RESPONSIBILITY,

20:28.353 --> 20:30.689
AND SHE'S TRYING
TO MAKE AMENDS.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.191
A FEW DAYS,

20:33.358 --> 20:37.237
AND SHE IS GOING TO BE THE
MARY YOU ALWAYS KNEW.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.615
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE EXAMINATION?

20:45.871 --> 20:47.748
IF YOU FORGET
THIS PUNISHMENT,

20:47.915 --> 20:49.791
ALL YOUR GIRLS
COULD EXPECT YOU

20:49.958 --> 20:51.209
TO FORGET
THE NEXT ONE

20:51.376 --> 20:53.754
AND THE NEXT ONE
AFTER THAT.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.174
THAT'S TRUE.

20:59.468 --> 21:03.221
FAMILY DISCIPLINE
IS...

21:03.388 --> 21:06.808
WELL, IT'S BASED
ON PROMISES KEPT

21:06.975 --> 21:09.353
FOR PUNISHMENT
OR REWARD.

21:09.519 --> 21:13.190
WITHOUT CONSTANCY, A CHILD
HAS NO RULES TO LIVE BY.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.653
NOR DO WE.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.115
THANK YOU.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.334
COME ON, MARY.
HURRY UP.

21:32.501 --> 21:34.252
OTHERWISE WE WON'T
HAVE ANY TIME TO PLAY

21:34.419 --> 21:35.420
BEFORE
THE BELL RINGS.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.756
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE PLAYING.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.014
DO YOU WANT
SOME CANDY?

21:46.181 --> 21:47.349
WHAT?

21:47.516 --> 21:49.184
WELL, I STILL HAVEN'T
PAID YOU BACK

21:49.351 --> 21:51.436
THE HALF OF A CHRISTMAS
PENNY I OWE YOU.

21:51.603 --> 21:52.854
AH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.857
WELL, LICORICE ALWAYS
MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.275
ALL RIGHT.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.123
WELL, GOOD
MORNING, GIRLS.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.124
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

22:12.290 --> 22:13.709
HI, MR. OLESON.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.169
WE'D LIKE A WHOLE PENNY'S
WORTH OF LICORICE, PLEASE.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.213
MY, MY.

22:18.380 --> 22:22.509
A WHOLE PENNY-- IT SOUNDS
LIKE A REAL CELEBRATION.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.552
MR. OLESON?

22:23.719 --> 22:24.469
YES?

22:24.636 --> 22:25.804
THAT SIGN--
"HELP WANTED"?

22:25.971 --> 22:26.888
MM-HMM.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.141
WHAT KIND OF HELP
DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

22:29.307 --> 22:32.477
OH, JUST SOMEBODY TO HELP AROUND
HERE KEEPING THINGS NEAT,

22:32.644 --> 22:34.438
KEEPING AN EYE
ON THE PLACE

22:34.604 --> 22:35.856
WHEN I'M
IN THE STOREROOM.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.858
SEE, NELLIE CAN'T HELP
OUT FOR A FEW WEEKS.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.776
SHE'S STUDYING FOR THAT
SPECIAL EXAMINATION.

22:39.943 --> 22:40.944
WELL,
I'M A GOOD WORKER,

22:41.111 --> 22:42.529
AND I ADD
BETTER THAN MOST.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.866
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR MA
AND PA WOULD LIKE THAT IDEA.

22:46.033 --> 22:48.493
I'LL ASK MA. I'M SURE
IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.495
IT WOULD MEAN EVERY
DAY AFTER SCHOOL

22:50.662 --> 22:52.039
AND ALL DAY
ON SATURDAY.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.331
THAT'S FINE.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.459
WELL, I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.003
YOU ASK YOUR MA,
AND IF SHE SAYS YES,

22:58.170 --> 22:59.588
YOU CAN START
TOMORROW.

22:59.755 --> 23:00.964
THANK YOU.

23:01.131 --> 23:02.174
WELL, THERE'S
YOUR LICORICE--

23:02.340 --> 23:03.341
A WHOLE
PENNY'S WORTH!

23:03.508 --> 23:04.634
AND HERE'S
YOUR PENNY.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.344
THANK YOU.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.056
COME ON, LAURA.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.724
OH, MR. OLESON?

23:10.891 --> 23:12.768
YES?

23:12.934 --> 23:14.436
HOW MUCH DO I GET?

23:14.603 --> 23:16.688
50 CENTS A WEEK.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.565
THANK YOU.

23:18.732 --> 23:20.609
MR. OLESON?

23:20.776 --> 23:22.861
YES, MARY?

23:23.028 --> 23:24.988
HOW MUCH IS
A HISTORY BOOK?

23:25.155 --> 23:27.491
WELL, THAT ALL
DEPENDS ON THE BOOK.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.117
A <i>THOMPSON
AMERICAN HISTORY.</i>

23:29.284 --> 23:31.328
ABOUT A DOLLAR.

23:31.495 --> 23:33.288
THANK YOU.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.557
WHY, MARY. I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE OUT AT RECESS.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.518
I WAS JUST LOOKING
AT THE BOOK.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.813
YES. lT'LL BE A NICE
PRIZE FOR SOMEBODY.

23:57.979 --> 23:59.523
YES, MA'AM.

24:00.398 --> 24:01.483
MISS BEADLE?

24:01.650 --> 24:04.277
YES, MARY?

24:04.444 --> 24:06.780
I THINK I'LL
GO OUT AND PLAY.

24:25.423 --> 24:27.384
Laura: GUESS IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

24:27.551 --> 24:28.844
WHAT ISN'T?

24:29.010 --> 24:30.637
WHAT I'M THINKING
ABOUT.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.931
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

24:33.098 --> 24:36.268
YOU DIDN'T DO
WHAT MA TOLD YOU TO DO.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.894
YOU DIDN'T TELL
MISS BEADLE

24:38.061 --> 24:40.981
THAT YOU COULDN'T BE
IN THE AWARDS CONTEST.

24:41.148 --> 24:43.024
YOU KNOW
WHY I DIDN'T.

24:43.191 --> 24:46.903
I KNOW. BECAUSE YOU'D
HAVE TO GIVE BACK A BOOK

24:47.070 --> 24:49.197
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO GIVE BACK.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.908
I'LL HAVE IT AS SOON AS I
EARN THE MONEY TO BUY IT,

24:52.075 --> 24:54.828
AND THAT'S BEFORE
THE AWARD CONTEST.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.456
THE DAY BEFORE.

24:58.623 --> 24:59.666
YES.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.670
THEN ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL HER WHAT MA SAID?

25:05.297 --> 25:07.716
THAT'S
A LONG TIME AWAY.

25:07.883 --> 25:09.718
BUT WHAT IF MA
ASKS YOU?

25:09.885 --> 25:11.386
ASKS ME WHAT?

25:11.553 --> 25:15.348
IF YOU TOLD MISS BEADLE
WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.518
MAYBE MA WON'T ASK.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.188
THAT'S A BIG MAYBE.

25:21.354 --> 25:24.691
REMEMBER, PA ALWAYS SAYS,
"NEVER CROSS YOUR BRIDGES

25:24.858 --> 25:26.109
UNTIL YOU GET
TO THEM."

25:26.276 --> 25:28.153
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.530
I'M GOING TO WAIT
FOR MY BRIDGES.

25:40.832 --> 25:41.958
[WHINNIES]

25:44.502 --> 25:46.129

25:52.469 --> 25:53.970
HI, MA.

25:54.137 --> 25:57.349
HELLO. OOH!
CLOSE THE DOOR.

25:57.515 --> 25:58.808

25:58.975 --> 26:00.352
I'M GOING OUT
TO PLAY.

26:00.518 --> 26:01.353
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR CHORES?

26:01.519 --> 26:02.687
I'LL DO THEM.

26:02.854 --> 26:03.897
HI, MARY.

26:04.064 --> 26:05.315
HI, MA.

26:07.692 --> 26:08.860
HOW WAS SCHOOL
TODAY?

26:09.027 --> 26:11.154
OH, SAME AS ALWAYS.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.325
AND, MA?

26:15.492 --> 26:17.202
MM-HMM?

26:17.369 --> 26:19.371
MR. OLESON HAD
A SIGN IN HIS STORE

26:19.537 --> 26:21.706
THAT SAID "HELP WANTED."

26:23.250 --> 26:24.209
AND?

26:24.376 --> 26:26.503
I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT.

26:27.879 --> 26:28.880
WELL?

26:29.047 --> 26:30.882
HE SAID
I COULD HAVE THE JOB

26:31.049 --> 26:33.260
IF YOU SAID
IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

26:34.719 --> 26:36.721
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO ALL THAT

26:36.888 --> 26:38.348
AND KEEP UP
YOUR CHORES, TOO?

26:38.515 --> 26:40.600
OH, YES, MA.
I CAN DO IT.

26:40.767 --> 26:41.810
ALL RIGHT,

26:41.977 --> 26:45.063
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP YOUR
MARKS UP AT SCHOOL.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.439
OH, THANK YOU, MA.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.442
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER
GET TO MY CHORES.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.987
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

26:58.243 --> 26:59.661
THERE YOU ARE,
MRS. FOSTER.

26:59.828 --> 27:01.288
SHOULD I PUT THAT
ON YOUR ACCOUNT?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.081
CERTAINLY. SAY HELLO
TO YOUR MOTHER FOR ME.

27:03.248 --> 27:04.124
I WILL. GOOD-BYE.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.375
BYE.

27:25.770 --> 27:26.896
WORKING HARD?

27:27.063 --> 27:28.440
DOING JUST FINE.

27:28.606 --> 27:31.943
YOU SHOULD LOOK NICER WHEN
YOU COME TO WORK IN A STORE.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.529
MAYBE YOUR MOTHER WOULD LET
YOU WEAR YOUR SUNDAY DRESS.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.448
MY SUNDAY DRESS
IS FOR CHURCH.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.867
WELL, YOU DON'T GET PAID
FOR GOING TO CHURCH.

27:39.034 --> 27:41.828
AND I DON'T WORSHIP IN
OLESON'S MERCANTILE.

27:42.662 --> 27:43.955
OH, HELLO, MISS BEADLE.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.582
OH, HELLO, NELLIE.
WHY, MARY.

YES, MA'AM.

27:49.586 --> 27:51.421
I CAN'T WORK UNTIL
AFTER THE EXAMINATION.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.465
MOTHER WON'T LET ME.
SHE WANTS ME TO STUDY.

27:53.631 --> 27:54.966
WELL, THAT'S FINE,
NELLIE.

EVERY ONE OF THEM.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.318
YOU'RE A VERY
LUCKY GIRL, NELLIE.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.820
I WISH ALL MY STUDENTS HAD
THE SAME OPPORTUNITY.

28:15.987 --> 28:18.656
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO
IS BUY THE BOOKS.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.660
NELLIE, I THINK
YOU BETTER GET STARTED.

28:22.827 --> 28:25.330
YES, MISS BEADLE.

LT'LL BE
JUST A MINUTE.

AND THE EXAMINATION.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.517
I CAN MANAGE.

TO STUDY?

28:54.234 --> 28:56.694
HERE YOU ARE.
THAT'S 4 CENTS.

28:56.861 --> 28:59.155

ANSWER MY QUESTION.

28:59.322 --> 29:02.534
WHEN DO YOU FIND TIME TO
STUDY FOR THE EXAMINATION?

29:02.700 --> 29:05.245
YOU HAVE
A VERY GOOD CHANCE.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.456
I HAVE A LOT
OF FREE TIME HERE,

29:08.623 --> 29:11.042
AND I CAN READ ALL THE
BOOKS IN THE STORE

29:11.209 --> 29:12.544

OH, I SEE.
VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD.

WELL, I'LL SEE YOU

BETTER MEMORY THAN I HAVE.

31:07.742 --> 31:10.161
JUST FORGOT WHAT
TIME IT WAS, MA.

31:10.328 --> 31:11.412
I DIDN'T
MEAN TO.

31:11.579 --> 31:12.664
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK

31:12.830 --> 31:14.332
THAT I'D WORKED HER
THAT LATE.

31:14.499 --> 31:16.793
I DIDN'T THINK SO,
MR. OLESON.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.837
I WAS WORRIED, MARY.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.131
THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING HER HOME.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.133
I EXPECT SUPPER
IS ON THE TABLE.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.135
YES, IT IS.

31:29.514 --> 31:31.349
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
A GOOD WORKER.

31:31.516 --> 31:32.976
SHE'S A GOOD READER, TOO.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.352
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS
DOING WHEN I LOCKED UP

31:34.519 --> 31:38.147
AND DIDN'T NOTICE
SHE WAS THERE.

31:38.314 --> 31:39.566
I BETTER GO EAT.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.569
UH, THANK YOU,
MR. OLESON.

31:44.404 --> 31:45.655

32:25.945 --> 32:27.405
MY HOMEWORK.

32:27.572 --> 32:31.701
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DID
IT AT OLESON'S MERCANTILE.

32:31.868 --> 32:33.578
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.330
I...BUT...

32:35.496 --> 32:37.999
MISS BEADLE
CAME IN TODAY,

32:38.166 --> 32:39.417
AND I WANTED
TO TELL HER

32:39.584 --> 32:41.461
I COULDN'T TAKE
THE EXAMINATION,

32:41.628 --> 32:44.339
BUT--BUT
I JUST COULDN'T.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.758
SHE WANTS ME
TO TAKE IT.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.927
SHE SAID I HAVE A
GOOD CHANCE TO WIN.

32:50.094 --> 32:52.847

YOU COULDN'T.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.682
I KNOW,

32:54.849 --> 32:57.435
BUT I CAN'T DISAPPOINT
MISS BEADLE.

32:57.602 --> 33:00.938
SHE'S SURE I'M GOING
TO TAKE THE TEST.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.650
IF I TAKE IT
AND WIN,

33:03.816 --> 33:06.277
I THINK MA WILL
BE SO PROUD,

33:06.444 --> 33:07.945
SHE WON'T BE ANGRY.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.615
I'M NOT SO SURE.

33:10.782 --> 33:14.035
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
ELSE I CAN DO.

33:18.498 --> 33:21.834
BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T
WIN AND MA FINDS OUT?

33:28.424 --> 33:30.927
I'LL JUST
HAVE TO WIN.

HONESTLY, I DID.

37:42.470 --> 37:46.015
I WAS THAT NERVOUS
AND UPSET.

WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
DONE THAT, HAVE YOU?

37:48.559 --> 37:50.186
NO, MA'AM.

MARY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SCOOT ON HOME

37:55.942 --> 37:58.235

38:23.594 --> 38:24.971
IT'S THE MONEY
I EARNED.

38:25.137 --> 38:28.057
I THOUGHT IF PA HAD TO BUY
ANYTHING TO FIX THE BARN...

38:28.224 --> 38:30.184

VERY HARD.

38:34.063 --> 38:35.356
I LEARNED A LOT.

38:35.523 --> 38:37.483
BUT ALL THOSE HOURS.

38:37.650 --> 38:40.027

THERE AREN'T
MANY YOUNG FOLKS

WHO WOULD SPEND
THEIR OWN MONEY

TO BUY
A HISTORY BOOK.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.813
I KNOW NEITHER ONE
OF MINE WOULD.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.064
A HISTORY BOOK?

40:40.231 --> 40:41.982
I WAS SURPRISED
THAT SHE BOUGHT IT.

45:30.312 --> 45:31.688
I THOUGHT
SHE'D BE HERE.

45:31.855 --> 45:35.067
I CAME OUT BECAUSE I
WANTED TO SHOW YOU THIS.

45:37.027 --> 45:38.654
IT'S NOT THE KIND
OF EXAMINATION PAPER

45:38.821 --> 45:40.072
MOST PARENTS
WOULD ENJOY,

45:40.239 --> 45:41.698
BUT IN THIS CASE,

45:41.865 --> 45:44.785
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE.

45:55.838 --> 45:58.757
AND SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT.

45:58.924 --> 46:01.009
I SEE.
