01:49.871 --> 01:52.305
And now my mind
is made up.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.305
Oh, Lucy.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.308
I never heard
of such a thing.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.809
Oh, Lucy, Lucy.

01:56.878 --> 01:58.812
Please don't make it
more difficult.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.814
I know you've tried to be
generous and kind...

02:00.882 --> 02:03.248
but it simply won't work,
my living here.

02:03.318 --> 02:04.751
Eva, speak to her.

02:04.819 --> 02:06.878
Are you serious, Lucy?

02:06.954 --> 02:08.251
Yes, Eva, I am.

02:08.323 --> 02:10.257
And poor Edwin
barely cold in his grave.

02:10.324 --> 02:12.259
He's been dead
almost a year now.

02:12.327 --> 02:14.158
Still you might have
some consideration
for your husband's memory.

02:14.228 --> 02:17.254
I don't see what Edwin's
got to do with this.

02:17.332 --> 02:20.392
I'm not leaving him,
I'm leaving you.

02:20.468 --> 02:24.370
After all we've tried
to do for her.

02:24.439 --> 02:26.771
You mustn't think
I'm not grateful.

02:26.841 --> 02:28.775
You've both been
so very kind to me...

02:28.843 --> 02:32.279
but I'm not really
a member of the family...

02:32.347 --> 02:34.781
except for marrying your son,
and now he's gone.

02:34.849 --> 02:36.783
I have my own life to live...

02:36.851 --> 02:38.785
and you have yours...

02:38.853 --> 02:40.844
and they simply
won't mix.

02:40.922 --> 02:43.789
I've never had
a life of my own.

02:43.858 --> 02:48.295
It's been Edwin's life
and yours and Eva's...

02:48.363 --> 02:51.059
never my own.

02:51.132 --> 02:52.463
Stop sniveling, Mother.

02:52.533 --> 02:54.296
If she's determined
to make a fool of herself...

02:54.369 --> 02:56.303
there's nothing
we can do about it.

02:56.371 --> 03:00.307
But what will I have to
remind me of poor Edwin?

03:00.375 --> 03:03.208
Lucy, have you
considered Anna?

03:03.277 --> 03:05.245
Yes, Eva, I have.

03:05.313 --> 03:08.578
You're willing to take responsibility
for what might become of her?

03:08.649 --> 03:10.549
She's my daughter, Eva.

03:10.618 --> 03:12.745
And what do you
mean by that?

03:12.820 --> 03:14.253
Only what I said.

03:14.322 --> 03:16.916
You're insinuating
that I interfere with Anna.

03:16.991 --> 03:19.391
Don't deny it, Lucy.

03:20.828 --> 03:22.728
Don't deny it, I say!

03:22.797 --> 03:25.163
I'm not denying it, Eva.

03:27.368 --> 03:30.804
Please, can't we discuss this
without quarreling?

03:30.872 --> 03:33.306
I'm sure I don't know
how you'll manage, Lucy.

03:33.374 --> 03:35.308
You haven't any money.

03:35.376 --> 03:37.310
I have the income
from Edwin's gold shares.

03:37.378 --> 03:40.814
Anna and I can live
quite cheaply with Martha.

03:40.882 --> 03:43.146
Do you mean you're
taking Martha Huggins?

03:43.217 --> 03:46.812
And why not? She was with me
before I came to live with you.

03:46.888 --> 03:48.287
Of all the ungrateful--

03:48.356 --> 03:52.292
Please, Eva. I'm sorry,
but I've made up my mind.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.796
But where, Lucy,
where can you go?

03:55.863 --> 03:58.491
The seaside, I think.

03:58.566 --> 04:01.399
I've always wanted
to live by the sea.

04:01.469 --> 04:02.527
Oh, goody.

04:02.603 --> 04:05.299
Well, that's all I have to say.

04:05.373 --> 04:07.807
I should think
it's quite enough.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.309
Apparently there's
nothing we can do about it...

04:10.378 --> 04:12.312
but when you realize
your mistake

04:12.380 --> 04:14.314
and try to come
crawling back to us...

04:14.382 --> 04:16.315
don't expect
any encouragement from me.

04:16.384 --> 04:18.147
I won't, Eva.

04:27.895 --> 04:30.830
Well, it's done.

04:30.898 --> 04:34.163
Oh, it's a blooming
revolution, that's what.

04:46.914 --> 04:50.008
Isn't Whitecliff
beautiful, Martha?

05:08.870 --> 05:12.306
Oh, I am sorry.

05:12.373 --> 05:13.840
It's quite all right.

05:13.908 --> 05:15.876
Are you Mr. Itchen?

05:15.943 --> 05:17.877
Mr. Itchen passed on
3O years ago.

05:17.945 --> 05:19.879
May he rest in peace.

05:19.947 --> 05:21.380
Mr. Boles?

05:21.449 --> 05:22.381
Likewise.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.883
Then you're Mr. Coombe.

05:23.951 --> 05:25.077
Junior.

05:25.152 --> 05:26.881
Of course.
You answered my letter.
Please eat.

05:26.954 --> 05:28.387
Thank you.

05:28.456 --> 05:29.889
I'm Mrs. Muir.

05:29.957 --> 05:32.391
Mrs. Muir, of course.
You were desirous of renting a house.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.392
Yes.

05:33.461 --> 05:35.395
Well, I've selected
several prospects

05:35.463 --> 05:39.399
suitable to a young lady
in bereaved circumstances.

05:40.968 --> 05:44.404
Bowles Yard. Seaside villa.
Three beds, two recept...

05:44.472 --> 05:46.406
complete offices,
company's gas and water...

05:46.474 --> 05:49.409
ideally sits near bus stops,
modern drains, private garden...

05:49.477 --> 05:51.911
1 2O.
1 O deposit.

05:51.979 --> 05:54.072
I'm afraid that's
a little too expensive.

05:54.148 --> 05:55.115
Right.

05:58.986 --> 06:02.353
Labernum Mount.
First-class residential street...

06:02.423 --> 06:04.857
four bed, one recept,
sun parlor, offices...

06:04.926 --> 06:07.861
company's gas and water,
beautifully planted, short walk--

06:07.929 --> 06:09.863
This one.
Uh, Gull Cottage.

06:09.931 --> 06:11.865
What was that, madam?

06:11.933 --> 06:13.366
This house.
Gull Cottage.

06:13.434 --> 06:15.368
It's exactly the sort of
place I'm looking for.

06:15.436 --> 06:17.768
Gull Cottage. Oh, no, no.
That wouldn't suit you at all.

06:17.838 --> 06:20.864
Labernum Mount.
First-class residential street...

06:20.942 --> 06:22.876
four bed, one recept,
sun parlor, offices...

06:22.944 --> 06:24.377
company's gas and water--

06:24.445 --> 06:27.380
And only 52. That's very little
for a furnished house.

06:27.448 --> 06:29.382
It's a ridiculous price.

06:29.450 --> 06:31.884
I suppose
there's something wrong.

06:31.953 --> 06:34.012
Is it the drains?

06:34.088 --> 06:37.455
When Itchen, Boles, & Coombe
put up a house for rent...

06:37.525 --> 06:40.460
you may be sure there is
nothing wrong with the drains.

06:40.528 --> 06:42.462
Then why shouldn't it suit me?

06:42.530 --> 06:45.693
My dear young lady, you must
allow me to be the judge of that.

06:45.766 --> 06:47.961
Now where were we?
Oh, yes. Labernum Mount.

06:48.035 --> 06:49.969
Beautifully planted,
short walk from--

06:50.037 --> 06:51.971
But if I'm going to
live in the house...

06:52.039 --> 06:53.472
I should be the judge.

06:53.541 --> 06:55.475
You'll only waste your time.

06:55.543 --> 06:56.976
But it's my time.

06:57.044 --> 06:59.478
I believe there's another
house agency in Whitecliff.

06:59.547 --> 07:02.778
Perhaps they have
Gull Cottage listed, too.

07:02.850 --> 07:05.717
Very well, madam,
if you insist.

07:07.788 --> 07:10.222
[Blows Out Candle]

07:10.291 --> 07:12.725
I shall drive you to Gull Cottage
in my motorcar.

07:12.793 --> 07:15.387
That's very good of you,
Mr. Coombe.

07:53.834 --> 07:56.268
Uh, Mrs. Muir.

07:56.337 --> 08:00.273
It's only a short drive
to Labernum Mount.

08:00.341 --> 08:03.208
But I want to see the inside.

08:03.277 --> 08:04.710
The inside?

08:04.779 --> 08:08.215
Of course.
What on earth's the matter?

08:08.282 --> 08:10.375
Very well.
If you insist.

08:30.304 --> 08:31.737
Terribly dusty.

08:31.806 --> 08:34.240
The house has been empty
for nearly four years.

08:34.308 --> 08:35.741
Oh.

08:35.809 --> 08:37.744
Office is back there.
Living on the right.

08:37.812 --> 08:39.746
Dining off the living.

08:49.256 --> 08:50.883
Oh.

08:50.958 --> 08:54.086
Of course.
It's a painting.

08:55.830 --> 08:57.764
I thought for a moment...

08:59.333 --> 09:00.766
Who is it?

09:00.835 --> 09:04.703
The, uh, former owner,
a Captain Gregg.

09:04.772 --> 09:06.205
A sea captain.

09:06.273 --> 09:10.209
That explains the scheme
of decoration, doesn't it?

09:10.277 --> 09:12.211
Which is in frightful taste.

09:12.279 --> 09:14.713
Oh, I don't agree with you.

09:14.782 --> 09:16.716
It's really a lovely room...

09:16.784 --> 09:18.718
and most of the furniture
will do as it is.

09:18.786 --> 09:21.220
Mrs. Muir, I must beg of you
not to be so precipitous.

09:21.288 --> 09:23.722
I assure you this house
will not suit you at all.

09:23.791 --> 09:27.727
Oh, but it does.
It suits me perfectly.

09:27.795 --> 09:29.729
What a hideous tree.

09:29.797 --> 09:32.231
What kind of a tree is it?

09:32.299 --> 09:34.733
I believe it is called
a monkey puzzle tree.

09:34.802 --> 09:36.235
Why?

09:36.303 --> 09:38.737
Because it defies the efforts
of monkeys to climb it, presumably.

09:38.806 --> 09:42.401
Why, it ruins the view.
I'll have it chopped down.

09:46.814 --> 09:49.749
Did you say something,
Mr. Coombe?

09:49.817 --> 09:51.250
No, I did not.

09:54.321 --> 09:57.256
Well, I think I'd better
see the rest of it.

09:57.324 --> 09:59.258
As you wish, Mrs. Muir.

10:28.082 --> 10:29.515
What on earth?

10:29.583 --> 10:30.948
What, Mrs. Muir?

10:31.018 --> 10:34.454
That table. I thought you said
no one had been here.

10:34.522 --> 10:36.456
I said nothing of the sort.

10:36.524 --> 10:38.458
I said the house
had been empty. It has.

10:38.526 --> 10:40.460
A charwoman
was here last week.

10:40.528 --> 10:42.462
Well, she must have left
in a frightful hurry.

10:42.530 --> 10:43.963
That she did.

10:44.031 --> 10:45.965
Did she tell you why?

10:46.033 --> 10:47.967
She told me nothing.

10:48.035 --> 10:49.969
She returned the key
to the office whilst I was out.

10:50.037 --> 10:50.969
Oh.

10:51.038 --> 10:52.471
Mrs. Muir, I--

10:52.540 --> 10:54.974
I know, it won't suit me.
But it does.

10:57.545 --> 11:00.981
I'd like to see the upstairs.

11:01.048 --> 11:03.107
The upstairs.

11:23.504 --> 11:26.598
The, uh, main bedroom.

11:41.188 --> 11:42.951
Of course.

11:43.023 --> 11:45.958
He liked to watch the ships.

11:46.026 --> 11:47.459
Hmm.

11:47.528 --> 11:49.462
But what...

11:49.530 --> 11:53.466
That's what it is.
You're clean.

11:53.534 --> 11:56.469
I beg your pardon,
Mrs. Muir.

11:56.537 --> 11:58.971
Oh, not you, Mr. Coombe,
the telescope.

11:59.039 --> 12:01.473
[Ghostly Laughter]

12:01.542 --> 12:04.306
Did you laugh,
Mr. Coombe?

12:04.378 --> 12:07.074
[Ghostly Laughter]

12:07.147 --> 12:08.580
Mr. Coombe?

12:26.166 --> 12:28.066
You would come.
I didn't want to show it to you...

12:28.135 --> 12:30.262
but, oh, no, no,
you had to see it.

12:30.337 --> 12:34.330
Haunted.
How perfectly fascinating.

12:34.408 --> 12:35.875
Fascinating?

12:35.943 --> 12:40.107
I suppose it's fascinating that
this house is driving me to drink.

12:40.180 --> 12:43.115
To drink!
Four times I've rented it

12:43.183 --> 12:46.118
and four times the tenants
have left after the very first night.

12:46.186 --> 12:48.620
The owner's in Australia,
Captain Gregg's cousin.

12:48.689 --> 12:51.123
I've written to him, cabled him
begging him to release me...

12:51.191 --> 12:53.125
but he only replies,
""Rely on you.''

12:53.193 --> 12:55.627
Well, I don't want
to be relied on.

12:55.696 --> 12:57.630
I never want to see
this house again.

12:57.698 --> 13:00.132
I wish Captain Gregg
had lived to be 1 OO.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.134
I wish he'd never been born.

13:02.202 --> 13:04.067
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Coombe.

13:04.138 --> 13:07.073
Well, at least you know now
why it won't suit you.

13:07.141 --> 13:10.577
Yes, I--I suppose so.

13:10.644 --> 13:14.080
Why does he haunt?
Was he murdered?

13:14.148 --> 13:16.082
No, he committed suicide.

13:16.150 --> 13:18.584
Uhh! I wonder why.

13:18.652 --> 13:21.587
To save someone the trouble
of assassinating him, no doubt.

13:21.655 --> 13:23.748
Come. We'll go
to Labernum Mount.

13:27.995 --> 13:30.657
Mrs. Muir.

13:30.731 --> 13:32.926
Mrs. Muir, if you please.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.096
You'll probably think it
very silly of me, Mr. Coombe...

13:37.171 --> 13:40.607
but I've decided to take
Gull Cottage after all.

13:40.674 --> 13:44.110
I mean, if everyone rushes off
at the slightest sound...

13:44.178 --> 13:46.112
of course the house
gets a bad name.

13:46.180 --> 13:48.114
But it's too ridiculous, really...

13:48.182 --> 13:50.116
in the 2Oth century,
to believe in apparitions

13:50.184 --> 13:52.118
and all that
medieval nonsense.

13:52.186 --> 13:54.120
But you heard him laugh.

13:54.188 --> 13:56.122
I heard what might
have been a laugh.

13:56.190 --> 13:58.624
It might have been the wind
roaring down the chimney.

13:58.692 --> 14:01.126
If I may so say, Mrs. Muir,
fiddlesticks.

14:01.195 --> 14:03.060
I want Gull Cottage.

14:03.130 --> 14:07.066
In my opinion, you are the most
obstinate young woman I have ever met.

14:07.134 --> 14:08.567
Thank you, Mr. Coombe.

14:08.636 --> 14:11.901
I've always wanted
to be considered obstinate.

14:11.972 --> 14:14.566
Very well, Mrs. Muir...

14:14.642 --> 14:18.078
on the understanding
that I disclaim all responsibility

14:18.145 --> 14:20.079
of what may happen...

14:20.147 --> 14:22.081
you shall have
Gull Cottage.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.094
Don't you dare come in.

14:38.165 --> 14:41.601
Bringing your muddy feet
through my nice clean kitchen.

14:41.669 --> 14:43.102
Landlubber.

14:43.170 --> 14:45.104
Uh, there.

14:45.172 --> 14:48.608
Nothing like soap and water
to make everything shipshape

14:48.676 --> 14:50.109
in Bristol fashion.

14:50.177 --> 14:51.610
Yes.

14:51.679 --> 14:53.613
What did you say, Martha?

14:53.681 --> 14:55.615
Why, I said--

14:55.683 --> 14:57.617
What did I say?

14:57.685 --> 14:59.619
Shipshape in Bristol fashion.

14:59.687 --> 15:02.121
I've never heard you use
that expression before.

15:02.189 --> 15:05.386
Huh. Must have been
the sea air.

15:06.627 --> 15:08.060
Come along, Mrs. Muir.

15:08.128 --> 15:10.062
I'll have that iron,
if you please.

15:10.130 --> 15:12.064
But I've nearly finished.

15:12.132 --> 15:14.066
You've done enough
hard work for today.

15:14.134 --> 15:16.068
Besides, you know,
you're supposed not to be--

15:16.136 --> 15:18.070
If you're going to start
telling me I'm not strong...

15:18.138 --> 15:20.572
I'll pack you off back to London
on the first train.

15:20.641 --> 15:23.576
Dear old London,
how I miss it.

15:23.644 --> 15:25.578
Now come along,
upstairs to your room

15:25.646 --> 15:28.080
and a bit of shut-eye
before tea.

15:29.783 --> 15:31.580
I feel so useless.

15:31.652 --> 15:34.587
Here I am nearly
halfway through life...

15:34.655 --> 15:36.589
and what have I done?

15:36.657 --> 15:38.591
I know what I done,
all right.

15:38.659 --> 15:41.093
Cooked enough steaks
to choke an hippopotamus

15:41.161 --> 15:45.598
and kept the name of Huggins
as fair as the day I found it.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.600
You've led
a very useful life, Martha.

15:47.668 --> 15:49.602
I have nothing to show
for all my years.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.604
I suppose you call
Miss Anna nothing.

15:51.672 --> 15:55.108
Oh, heavens.
I can't take any credit for her.

15:55.175 --> 15:57.609
She just happened.

15:57.678 --> 15:59.009
Yes.

15:59.079 --> 16:01.809
That's what my old mum
always used to say.

16:01.882 --> 16:03.747
I was the 1 1 th.

16:07.321 --> 16:08.253
Oh.

16:08.322 --> 16:09.721
Hurt yourself?

16:09.790 --> 16:11.519
Here, let's have a look.

16:11.592 --> 16:13.526
Oh, it's nothing,
just a scrape.

16:13.594 --> 16:16.529
But I am tired. I think
I will take a little rest.

16:18.098 --> 16:21.033
Begging your pardon,
Your Highness.

16:24.104 --> 16:25.537
There.

16:27.107 --> 16:30.042
This will keep you
nice and warm.

16:32.112 --> 16:34.046
Thanks, Martha,
you're an angel.

16:34.114 --> 16:37.550
Ha! Ain't noticed any wings
sproutin' lately.

16:42.623 --> 16:45.387
I'll call you in plenty
of time for tea.

17:03.143 --> 17:06.010
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

17:06.079 --> 17:08.343
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

17:08.415 --> 17:11.179
[Growling]

17:39.780 --> 17:41.543
[Ding-Ding]

17:47.621 --> 17:49.555
[Bang]

17:54.795 --> 17:56.524
[Bang]

17:58.632 --> 18:00.065
[Bang]

18:31.865 --> 18:34.527
Oh, it's you.

18:34.601 --> 18:38.059
I crept up, not
wanting to wake you

18:38.138 --> 18:41.073
in case you
was still asleep.

18:41.141 --> 18:42.574
Tea's all ready.

18:42.643 --> 18:45.077
Miss Anna will have it all
cleared off in no time

18:45.145 --> 18:47.079
if you don't hurry.

18:47.147 --> 18:50.082
I've got a nice bit
of fresh fish for you, too.

18:50.150 --> 18:53.085
Martha, I had
such a curious dream.

18:53.153 --> 18:56.589
Did I close the window
before I went to sleep?

18:56.657 --> 19:00.093
You did, and scraped your finger.
Don't you remember?

19:00.160 --> 19:02.594
It's shut now, ain't it?

19:02.663 --> 19:04.028
Yes.

19:08.602 --> 19:10.035
It's shut now.

19:25.118 --> 19:26.881
Sleep tight.

19:26.954 --> 19:31.050
Good night, Mummy.
I love the sea, and so does Rummy.

19:31.124 --> 19:32.557
And so do I.

19:50.143 --> 19:52.577
I put hot water bottles
on the kitchen table, ma'am...

19:52.646 --> 19:54.580
and the kettle's
on the stove.

19:54.648 --> 19:56.081
Oh, thank you, Martha.

19:56.149 --> 19:57.582
Good night, ma'am.

19:57.651 --> 19:59.084
Good night.

19:59.152 --> 20:01.086
Should I leave this on, ma'am?

20:01.154 --> 20:02.587
No. This will do nicely.

21:09.890 --> 21:11.291
[Thunder]

21:13.226 --> 21:16.320
[Thunder]

21:38.418 --> 21:40.511
I know you're here.

21:46.926 --> 21:50.020
I say, I know you're here.

21:51.431 --> 21:56.368
What's wrong?
Are you afraid to speak up?

21:56.436 --> 22:01.373
Is that all you're good for,
to frighten women?

22:01.441 --> 22:05.309
Well, I'm not afraid of you.

22:05.378 --> 22:08.313
Whoever heard
of a cowardly ghost?

22:08.381 --> 22:09.814
[Thunder]

22:09.882 --> 22:12.316
Now if the demonstration is over...

22:12.385 --> 22:15.320
I'll thank you not to interfere
while I boil some water

22:15.388 --> 22:17.322
for my hot water bottle.

22:17.390 --> 22:20.325
Light the candle.

22:20.393 --> 22:23.328
Go ahead, light it.

22:23.396 --> 22:27.833
How can I when you keep
blowing out the match?

22:27.900 --> 22:30.494
Light the blasted candle!

22:46.919 --> 22:48.750
Well?

22:48.821 --> 22:53.849
You'll--You'll forgive me
if I take a moment

22:53.926 --> 22:56.622
to get accustomed to you.

23:01.934 --> 23:03.902
You're Captain Gregg.

23:03.970 --> 23:05.904
Aye.

23:05.972 --> 23:09.373
I'm sorry I called you names...

23:09.442 --> 23:11.376
coward and so forth.

23:11.444 --> 23:15.346
I didn't really believe in you,
or I wouldn't have.

23:15.415 --> 23:18.316
It must have been
embarrassing to you.

23:18.384 --> 23:19.783
Why?

23:19.852 --> 23:23.879
Why, I mean because
of the way you died.

23:26.392 --> 23:28.986
The way I died, madam?

23:29.062 --> 23:32.964
I mean because
you committed suicide.

23:33.032 --> 23:35.830
What made you think
I committed suicide?

23:35.902 --> 23:37.335
Mr. Coombe said--

23:37.403 --> 23:40.338
Coombe's a fool.
They're all fools.

23:40.406 --> 23:43.842
I went to sleep
in front of that confounded
gas heater in my bedroom...

23:43.910 --> 23:47.846
and I must have kicked the gas on
with my foot in my sleep.

23:47.914 --> 23:51.008
It was a stormy night like this

23:51.084 --> 23:53.848
with half a gale blowing from
the south-southwest
into my windows...

23:53.920 --> 23:55.854
so I shut them as
any sensible man would.

23:55.922 --> 23:57.150
Wouldn't you?

23:57.223 --> 23:59.885
Yes, I suppose so.

23:59.959 --> 24:02.359
Then the coroner's jury
brought in a suicide

24:02.428 --> 24:04.794
because me blasted
charwoman testified

24:04.864 --> 24:06.798
I always slept
with me windows open.

24:06.866 --> 24:09.858
How the devil should
she know how I slept?

24:09.936 --> 24:11.733
Oh, I'm so glad.

24:11.804 --> 24:15.069
Do you have a strange
sense of humor, madam?

24:15.141 --> 24:18.770
I mean because you
didn't commit suicide...

24:18.845 --> 24:22.281
but if you didn't,
why do you haunt?

24:22.348 --> 24:25.283
Because I have plans
for me house

24:25.351 --> 24:27.285
which don't include
a pack of strangers barging in

24:27.353 --> 24:29.287
and making themselves at home.

24:29.355 --> 24:31.289
Then you were trying
to frighten me away.

24:31.357 --> 24:34.793
You call that trying?
I'd barely started.

24:34.861 --> 24:36.795
No, that was enough
for all the others.

24:36.863 --> 24:39.798
They didn't want any part of it,
let me tell you.

24:39.866 --> 24:41.800
Didn't even stop
to weigh anchor.

24:41.868 --> 24:43.802
They just cut their
cables and ran.

24:43.870 --> 24:46.304
I think it's very mean
of you frightening people...

24:46.372 --> 24:47.805
childish, too.

24:47.874 --> 24:49.808
In your case,
I'm prepared to admit

24:49.876 --> 24:52.811
I charted the course
with regret.

24:52.879 --> 24:54.813
You're not a bad-looking
woman, you know...

24:54.881 --> 24:56.815
especially
when you're asleep.

24:56.883 --> 25:00.319
So you were in my room
this afternoon.

25:00.386 --> 25:01.853
My room, madam.

25:01.921 --> 25:05.755
I thought I'd dreamed it.
Did you open the window
to frighten me?

25:05.825 --> 25:08.259
I opened the window because
I didn't want another accident

25:08.327 --> 25:10.420
with the blasted gas.

25:10.496 --> 25:12.327
Women are such fools.

25:12.398 --> 25:16.801
You, of all people,
should not have brought that up.

25:16.869 --> 25:20.965
I wouldn't call that remark
in the best of taste.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.907
Well, I'm sure it
was very kind of you...

25:23.976 --> 25:27.412
but I am quite capable
of taking care of myself.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.914
Now, if you don't mind.

25:29.982 --> 25:31.916
[Thunder]

25:42.795 --> 25:44.854
Well, what's the matter now?

25:44.931 --> 25:46.865
I just wanted to see
if you were really there.

25:46.933 --> 25:48.867
Of course I'm really here...

25:48.935 --> 25:51.665
and I'll still be here when
you've packed up and gone.

25:53.439 --> 25:55.373
But I'm not going.

25:55.441 --> 25:57.705
The house suits me perfectly.

25:57.777 --> 26:00.245
My dear woman,
it's not your house.

26:00.313 --> 26:01.974
It is as long as I pay rent.

26:02.048 --> 26:04.278
Pay rent to me blasted cousin!

26:04.350 --> 26:05.612
He's the legal owner.

26:05.685 --> 26:07.710
Legal owner be hanged!

26:07.787 --> 26:09.220
It's my house...

26:09.288 --> 26:11.722
and I want it turned into
a home for retired seamen.

26:11.791 --> 26:14.726
Then you should have
said so in your will.

26:14.794 --> 26:16.659
I didn't leave a will.

26:16.729 --> 26:18.026
Why not?

26:18.097 --> 26:20.725
I didn't expect to kick
the blasted gas on with me foot!

26:20.800 --> 26:23.735
I won't be shouted at.
Everyone shouts at me
and orders me about...

26:23.803 --> 26:25.737
and I'm sick of it,
do you hear?

26:25.805 --> 26:27.204
Blast! Blast! Blast!

26:27.273 --> 26:28.433
Temper. Ha ha!

26:28.507 --> 26:30.737
Or laughed at, either.
I won't leave this house.

26:30.810 --> 26:34.746
You can't make me
leave it. I won't!

26:36.315 --> 26:38.749
Here, belay that.

26:38.818 --> 26:41.082
Stop it now,
do you hear me?

26:41.153 --> 26:44.748
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's a woman crying.

26:44.824 --> 26:47.588
Stop it!
Blast it all, madam.

26:47.660 --> 26:51.255
I love this house.
I thought I must stay here

26:51.330 --> 26:53.264
the moment I saw it.

26:53.332 --> 26:54.765
I can't explain it.

26:54.834 --> 26:57.268
It was as if the house itself
were welcoming me...

26:57.336 --> 27:01.272
asking me to rescue it
from being so empty.

27:01.340 --> 27:04.275
You can't understand that,
can you?

27:04.343 --> 27:07.210
I suppose you think
I'm just a silly woman...

27:07.280 --> 27:10.215
but that's the way I feel.

27:10.283 --> 27:11.716
Hmm.

27:11.784 --> 27:14.218
Well, there might be
some truth in it at that.

27:14.287 --> 27:17.222
I felt that way
about a ship once...

27:17.290 --> 27:18.723
my first command.

27:18.791 --> 27:21.225
Found her rusting
in the Mersey...

27:21.294 --> 27:25.594
gear all foul
and a pigsty below.

27:27.233 --> 27:30.225
Always swore she sailed
twice as sweetly for me

27:30.303 --> 27:32.237
as she would
for any other master

27:32.305 --> 27:34.239
out of gratitude.

27:34.307 --> 27:39.074
Well, you love the house.
That counts for you.

27:39.145 --> 27:41.306
And you've got spunk.
You didn't frighten like the others.

27:41.380 --> 27:43.314
That counts for you, too.

27:43.382 --> 27:45.873
You may stay...

27:45.951 --> 27:47.316
on trial.

27:47.386 --> 27:48.819
Oh, thank you.

27:48.888 --> 27:50.822
Keep your distance,
madam.

27:50.890 --> 27:52.983
I'm sorry.
You made me so happy.

27:53.059 --> 27:54.822
No intention
of making you happy.

27:54.894 --> 27:56.828
I merely want to do
what's best for the house.

27:56.896 --> 28:00.195
Then we're agreed,
and you'll go right away
and leave us alone.

28:00.266 --> 28:04.794
I will not go right away.
Why should I?

28:04.870 --> 28:07.805
Because of Anna,
my little girl.

28:07.873 --> 28:09.807
I don't want her
frightened into fits.

28:09.875 --> 28:11.809
I never frighten
little girls into fits.

28:11.877 --> 28:14.812
Think of the bad language
she'd learn and the morals.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.815
Confound it, madam,
my language is most controlled...

28:17.883 --> 28:19.316
and as for me morals...

28:19.385 --> 28:22.320
I lived a man's life,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

28:22.388 --> 28:23.821
I can assure you

28:23.889 --> 28:26.323
no woman's ever been the
worse for knowing me...

28:26.392 --> 28:29.327
and I'd like to know how many
mealy-mouthed bluenoses

28:29.395 --> 28:30.828
can say the same.

28:30.896 --> 28:33.330
She's much too young
to see ghosts.

28:33.399 --> 28:35.833
Very well. I'll make
a bargain with you.

28:35.901 --> 28:37.835
Leave me bedroom as it is...

28:37.903 --> 28:40.337
and I'll promise not to go
into any other room in the house.

28:40.406 --> 28:42.340
And your brat need never
know anything about me.

28:42.408 --> 28:44.740
But if you keep the best bedroom,
where should I sleep?

28:44.810 --> 28:46.744
In the best bedroom.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.780
But...

28:48.848 --> 28:51.578
In heaven's name,
madam, why not?

28:51.650 --> 28:54.244
Why, bless my soul,
I'm a spirit.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.254
I have no body. I haven't
had one for four years...

28:56.322 --> 28:57.755
is that clear?

28:57.823 --> 28:59.757
But I can see you.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.759
All you see is an illusion.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.761
It's like a blasted
lantern slide.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.694
Well, it's not very convincing...

29:05.765 --> 29:07.699
but I suppose it's all right.

29:07.767 --> 29:10.702
Then it's settled.
I'm probably making a mistake.

29:10.770 --> 29:13.705
I always was a fool
for a helpless woman.

29:13.773 --> 29:15.206
I'm not helpless.

29:15.274 --> 29:17.208
If you're so confoundedly
competent...

29:17.276 --> 29:19.210
you'll notice your kettle's
about to boil over.

29:19.278 --> 29:20.973
Oh, so it is.

29:22.782 --> 29:25.046
Oh, one thing more.

29:25.117 --> 29:27.278
I want me painting
hung in the bedroom...

29:27.353 --> 29:29.287
the one that's
in the living room.

29:29.355 --> 29:32.119
Must I?
It's a very poor painting.

29:32.191 --> 29:34.989
It's my painting.
I didn't invite your criticism.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.324
I make that
part of the bargain.

29:37.396 --> 29:41.093
I want you to put it there now,
tonight. Good night.

29:41.167 --> 29:43.328
Good night.

29:43.402 --> 29:46.137
I mean, it doesn't
do you justice and--

29:46.270 --> 29:47.965
[Thunder]

30:02.386 --> 30:05.822
You might at least have
turned the light back on

30:05.890 --> 30:07.323
before you left.

30:07.391 --> 30:08.824
[Thunder]

30:48.432 --> 30:50.366
Such nonsense.

31:33.043 --> 31:35.944
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

31:57.534 --> 32:00.469
My dear, never
let anyone tell you

32:00.537 --> 32:02.300
to be ashamed
of your figure.!

32:04.441 --> 32:05.806
[Thunder]

32:12.182 --> 32:15.117
There!
That's the last of them.

32:16.687 --> 32:18.712
Never held
with mourning meself.

32:18.789 --> 32:21.383
I always say life's
black enough as it is

32:21.458 --> 32:23.050
without dressing in it, too.

32:23.127 --> 32:24.560
Cheer up, Martha.

32:24.628 --> 32:26.061
Life isn't as bad as that.

32:26.130 --> 32:27.563
Who said it was?

32:33.137 --> 32:34.365
Good afternoon.

32:34.438 --> 32:36.998
What have you done with
me monkey puzzle tree?

32:37.074 --> 32:39.872
I expect it's chopped
for firewood by now.

32:39.944 --> 32:41.377
Hang it all, madam!

32:41.445 --> 32:43.879
I planted that tree
with me own two hands.

32:43.948 --> 32:45.142
Why?

32:45.215 --> 32:48.013
Because I wanted
a monkey puzzle tree in me garden!

32:48.085 --> 32:51.054
Think how much prettier
a bed of roses will look there.

32:51.121 --> 32:52.588
I hate roses!

32:52.656 --> 32:56.092
I hope the whole blasted bed
dies of blight!

32:56.160 --> 32:59.095
I wish you wouldn't swear.
It's so ugly.

32:59.163 --> 33:00.755
If you think that's ugly...

33:00.831 --> 33:03.595
it's a good thing you
can't read me thoughts.

33:05.002 --> 33:08.199
You seem to be very
earthly for a spirit.

33:08.272 --> 33:11.537
And you, madam, are enough
to make a saint take to blasphemy!

33:11.608 --> 33:13.303
Blasted women!

33:13.377 --> 33:16.210
Always make trouble
when you allow one aboard.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.373
Captain Gregg,
if you insist on haunting me...

33:18.449 --> 33:20.041
you might at least be
more agreeable about it.

33:20.117 --> 33:21.379
Why should I be agreeable?

33:21.452 --> 33:23.044
Well, as long as we're living--

33:23.120 --> 33:26.055
I mean, if we're to be
thrown together so much...

33:26.123 --> 33:28.853
life's too short to be forever
barking at each other.

33:28.926 --> 33:31.053
Your life
may be short, madam.

33:31.128 --> 33:33.722
I have an unlimited time
at my disposal.

33:33.797 --> 33:35.731
There you go
arguing again.

33:35.799 --> 33:39.064
Try to say something
pleasant for a change.

33:39.136 --> 33:40.262
Hmm.

33:43.140 --> 33:46.735
Ah, that's a--that's
a pretty rig you have on.

33:46.810 --> 33:47.902
Oh, thank you, sir.

33:47.978 --> 33:49.275
Much better than
smothering yourself

33:49.346 --> 33:50.938
in all that ugly
black crepe.

33:51.015 --> 33:53.313
I happen to have been wearing
mourning for my husband.

33:53.384 --> 33:54.578
Whom you didn't love.

33:59.656 --> 34:01.590
How dare you say that!

34:01.658 --> 34:04.092
Because it's true.
You were fond of him perhaps...

34:04.161 --> 34:06.356
but you didn't love him.

34:06.430 --> 34:07.829
I suppose you're jealous

34:07.898 --> 34:10.025
because no one
put on mourning for you.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.261
That shows how little
you know about it.

34:12.335 --> 34:15.533
Some poor, misguided
female no doubt.

34:15.606 --> 34:19.042
Three poor, misguided
females to be exact.

34:19.109 --> 34:21.202
I should--I should think
you'd be ashamed of it

34:21.277 --> 34:23.041
instead of boasting
about it.

34:23.112 --> 34:24.978
Why? They
misguided themselves.

34:25.049 --> 34:26.539
I never raised
a finger to help them.

34:26.617 --> 34:28.880
That's not what I've heard
about sailors.

34:28.952 --> 34:30.543
Seamen, confound it!

34:30.621 --> 34:33.215
Sailor is a landlubber's word.

34:34.625 --> 34:36.388
Why did you marry him?

34:36.460 --> 34:37.552
Edwin?

34:39.463 --> 34:41.226
I don't really know.

34:43.132 --> 34:44.565
He was an architect.

34:44.635 --> 34:46.569
He came down
to plan an addition

34:46.637 --> 34:49.071
to my father's library.

34:49.139 --> 34:51.572
I was only 1 7.

34:51.641 --> 34:54.076
I remember I'd--
I'd just finished a novel

34:54.143 --> 34:56.408
in which the heroine was
kissed in the rose garden

34:56.480 --> 34:58.914
and lived happily ever after.

34:58.982 --> 35:01.576
So when Edwin kissed me
in the orchard--

35:01.652 --> 35:03.085
But it was different

35:03.153 --> 35:05.246
after you left the orchard.

35:06.590 --> 35:08.524
He didn't beat you, did he?

35:08.592 --> 35:10.526
Oh, no!

35:10.594 --> 35:14.189
Poor Edwin.
He never did anything.

35:14.264 --> 35:17.529
I'm afraid he wasn't even
a very good architect.

35:18.936 --> 35:21.871
He couldn't have designed
a house like this.

35:21.939 --> 35:23.372
Who did?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.374
I did.

35:26.944 --> 35:29.378
It reminds me of something--

35:29.446 --> 35:32.882
An old song, or--or a poem.

35:32.950 --> 35:34.884
""Magic casements,
opening on the foam

35:34.952 --> 35:38.388
of perilous seas,
in faery lands forlorn.''

35:38.455 --> 35:39.888
That's Keats, isn't it?

35:39.957 --> 35:41.390
The nightingale.

35:41.458 --> 35:45.394
Strange to find a sea captain
quoting Keats.

35:45.462 --> 35:47.896
Oh, life's slow at sea.

35:49.299 --> 35:51.893
Plenty of time for reading
in the off watches.

35:53.303 --> 35:55.396
How romantic.

35:55.472 --> 35:58.407
Reading lyric poetry
up in the crow's-nest

35:58.475 --> 36:00.909

bellying in the wind.

36:00.978 --> 36:02.912

36:02.980 --> 36:05.414

36:05.482 --> 36:07.507

36:08.785 --> 36:11.345
I don't know anything
about the sea

36:11.421 --> 36:13.116
except that it is romantic.

36:13.190 --> 36:15.090
Mmm. That's what
all landsmen think.

36:15.159 --> 36:16.717
Seamen know better.

36:16.793 --> 36:18.351
Then why do they
go to sea?

36:18.428 --> 36:20.862
Because they haven't
the sense to stay ashore.

36:20.931 --> 36:23.365
Heaven help
the ordinary seaman.

36:23.433 --> 36:24.866
Were you ever one?

36:24.935 --> 36:27.529
For several years,
while I learnt me trade.

36:28.939 --> 36:32.705
It's hard to imagine you
being an ordinary anything.

36:35.946 --> 36:37.880
[Carriage Approaching]

36:42.386 --> 36:44.115

36:46.957 --> 36:49.391
Oh, dear!
Whatever can they want?

or decompose.

do it quickly.

that they should.

Oh, then please don't choose.
I'll get rid of them.

37:13.083 --> 37:15.017
Why don't you let me?
I've had plenty of practice.

37:15.085 --> 37:17.485

and I'll keelhaul them.

like yours, madam...

we're just in time.

38:14.878 --> 38:17.506
So perhaps our bad news
is good news after all...

38:17.581 --> 38:20.015
and now we can all
go home and live together

about living alone.

39:05.395 --> 39:07.363
Yes, I heard her.
Stop sniveling, Mother.

39:07.431 --> 39:09.524
If that's what you want,
we will keep out of it.

39:09.599 --> 39:10.531
I didn't mean you.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.033
Then just whom
did you mean?

39:12.102 --> 39:14.036
Well, I--I could
explain, I suppose...

39:14.104 --> 39:16.038
but--but you
wouldn't believe me.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.539
All I know is
that you're acting

39:17.607 --> 39:19.040
in a most peculiar fashion.

39:19.109 --> 39:20.542
The only charitable explanation

39:20.610 --> 39:22.544
is that the solitude
has preyed on your mind.

39:22.612 --> 39:24.546
She thinks you've got
bats in your belfry.

39:24.614 --> 39:25.546
Oh, pipe down!

39:25.615 --> 39:28.049
I mean, I want to think.

39:28.118 --> 39:31.315
Very well, I will pipe down,
as you put it...

39:31.388 --> 39:32.548
but it should be
perfectly obvious

39:32.622 --> 39:33.884
that with your income gone

39:33.957 --> 39:35.549
there's only one course
for you to follow...

39:35.625 --> 39:37.149
and that is to come
home now, with us.

39:37.227 --> 39:39.491
You mean
give up this house?

39:39.563 --> 39:42.498
Naturally. It was idiotic
to take it in the first place...

39:42.566 --> 39:45.831
and now that you're a pauper,
how can you possibly stay?

39:50.073 --> 39:52.007
Don't do it, Lucy.

Do you want me to stay?

39:56.012 --> 39:57.001
Yes.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.513
Do you really mean it?

39:58.582 --> 39:59.947
Of course I mean it.

40:00.016 --> 40:01.540
Tell them to shove off.

40:01.618 --> 40:03.882
We'll think of something.

40:05.622 --> 40:08.759
I'm sorry. It's very kind of you
to want me back...

40:08.892 --> 40:11.156
but I'm going to stay.
I'll manage somehow.

to shove off.

the house suitable after all.

41:31.641 --> 41:34.075
I'm convinced now that
we were unduly concerned

41:34.144 --> 41:36.578
about the possibility
of a ghost haunting it.

41:36.646 --> 41:38.580
As you say, how could
such things exist

41:38.648 --> 41:40.582
in the 2Oth century?

41:40.650 --> 41:42.584
Indeed. How could they?

41:42.652 --> 41:45.951
Still, you must admit
it's a very isolated location...

41:46.022 --> 41:48.582
and I've often thought of you
out here alone

41:48.658 --> 41:53.095
without the protection of a man,
the right man, could offer you.

41:53.163 --> 41:54.824
[Engine Starts]

42:29.966 --> 42:32.400
I only hope when
I reach the afterlife

42:32.469 --> 42:33.868
I have a little more dignity.

42:33.937 --> 42:34.926
Dignity?

42:35.005 --> 42:36.905
Do you call it dignified
to throw yourself

42:36.973 --> 42:38.907
at a herring-gutted swab
like that?

42:38.975 --> 42:41.910
I asked Mr. Coombe here
because he's the logical man

42:41.978 --> 42:44.412
to help me find lodgers
for the summer.

42:44.481 --> 42:45.413
Lodgers?

42:45.482 --> 42:46.676
Oh.

42:48.318 --> 42:49.910
Here, weigh your anchor.

42:49.986 --> 42:51.419
Forgive me, my dear.

42:51.488 --> 42:52.921
I've been seriously misled.

42:52.989 --> 42:55.423
I thought you wanted
to sign him on for a husband.

42:55.492 --> 42:57.926
Mr. Coombe?
That walrus!

42:57.994 --> 43:00.929
It's my experience that women
will do anything for money.

43:00.997 --> 43:04.933
Now you and your blasted
experiences have ruined everything.

43:05.001 --> 43:06.434
No. No. No.
There's no harm done.

43:06.503 --> 43:08.869
I couldn't allow you to
take in lodgers in any case.

43:08.939 --> 43:10.873
They're worse
than passengers at sea.

43:10.941 --> 43:12.533
It's them or starve.

43:12.609 --> 43:15.009
Not at all, my dear.

43:15.078 --> 43:17.512
I've solved all your problems.

43:17.581 --> 43:19.276
You're going to write a book.

43:21.318 --> 43:23.252
A book?

43:23.320 --> 43:26.289
But I couldn't.

43:26.356 --> 43:29.018
I find it hard enough
to write a postcard.

43:29.092 --> 43:30.525
No, but I can.

43:30.594 --> 43:33.028
I can write a book...

43:33.096 --> 43:35.030
and you can put it
down on paper for me.

43:35.098 --> 43:36.531
What will the book be about?

43:36.600 --> 43:38.534
Me. The story of me life.

43:38.602 --> 43:41.867
And we'll call it,
uh, let's see.

43:41.938 --> 43:43.405
We'll call it, uh...

43:43.473 --> 43:45.532
Blood and Swash.

43:46.977 --> 43:49.912
Yes. Blood and Swash
by Captain X.

43:49.980 --> 43:52.210
I don't think that's
at all a nice title.

43:52.282 --> 43:53.715
It's not meant to be.

43:53.783 --> 43:56.718
It's meant to be sensational,
like the subject.

43:56.786 --> 43:59.050
But it takes months
to write a book.

43:59.122 --> 44:01.283
What are we to live on
in the meantime?

44:01.358 --> 44:02.552
You have jewelry?

44:02.626 --> 44:03.558
A little.

44:03.627 --> 44:04.559
Pawn it.

44:04.628 --> 44:06.061
But I couldn't!

44:06.129 --> 44:08.427
Blast your eyes, madam.
Will you understand?

44:08.498 --> 44:10.432
You're trying to
crawl off a lee shore.

44:10.500 --> 44:11.933
Can't afford to be squeamish.

44:12.002 --> 44:13.936
I do understand,
and don't swear at me.

44:14.004 --> 44:16.438
Start with that
ugly broach.

44:16.506 --> 44:18.440
But Edwin's mother
gave it to me.

44:18.508 --> 44:19.941
All the more reason
to pawn it.

44:20.010 --> 44:21.443
You don't like
Edwin's mother...

44:21.511 --> 44:24.742
and you
hate her broach. Hmm.

44:24.814 --> 44:26.509
Really, Captain Gregg.
I'll have you know

44:26.583 --> 44:28.244
I'm very fond
of my mother-in-law.

44:28.318 --> 44:30.684
Very well. If you're
so fond of her...

44:30.754 --> 44:32.221
you can go back
and live with her.

44:41.131 --> 44:43.599
I think I can get
about 1 O for it.

44:43.667 --> 44:47.034
I'm glad you're
going to be sensible...

44:47.103 --> 44:49.037
and since we're
to be collaborators...

44:49.105 --> 44:51.073
you can call me Daniel.

44:51.141 --> 44:53.473
That's very good of you.

44:53.543 --> 44:56.307
And I shall call you Lucia.

44:56.379 --> 44:58.506
My name is Lucy.

44:58.581 --> 45:01.049
It doesn't do you justice,
my dear.

45:01.117 --> 45:03.551
Women named Lucy are always
being imposed upon...

45:03.620 --> 45:07.056
but Lucia, now there's
a name for an amazon...

45:07.123 --> 45:08.488
for a queen.

45:08.558 --> 45:10.992
I don't feel much
like a queen.

45:11.061 --> 45:13.359
I feel frightened
and confused

45:13.430 --> 45:15.990
and wondering what
the future will bring.

45:16.066 --> 45:17.499
Don't you trust me?

45:17.567 --> 45:20.502
Oh, I do, Daniel,
when I'm talking to you.

45:20.570 --> 45:23.004
When you're not here, I--

45:23.073 --> 45:25.837
Well, it's asking a great deal
to expect anyone

45:25.909 --> 45:29.003
to trust her whole
future to a--

45:29.079 --> 45:31.013
To someone who isn't real.

45:31.081 --> 45:32.514
But I am real.

45:32.582 --> 45:34.675
I'm here because
you believe I'm here.

45:36.086 --> 45:38.520
And keep on believing...

45:38.588 --> 45:41.022
and I'll always
be real to you.

45:41.091 --> 45:43.025
Yes, Daniel.

45:47.897 --> 45:49.330
Ha ha ha!

45:54.270 --> 45:56.329
Ha ha ha!

46:14.858 --> 46:16.792
Well, what's the matter?

46:20.363 --> 46:21.796
You haven't finished
the sentence.

46:21.865 --> 46:23.298
I know. It's--

46:23.366 --> 46:25.800
It's-- It's that word.

46:25.869 --> 46:27.803
I've never written
such a word.

46:27.871 --> 46:29.304
It's a perfectly good word.

46:29.372 --> 46:31.306
I think it's a horrid word.

46:31.374 --> 46:33.308
It means what it says,
doesn't it?

46:33.376 --> 46:34.809
All too clearly.

46:34.878 --> 46:36.311
What word do you use

46:36.379 --> 46:37.812
if you wanted to
convey that meaning?

46:37.881 --> 46:38.973
I don't use any!

46:39.048 --> 46:40.481
Well, hang it all, Lucia.

46:40.550 --> 46:42.313
If you're going to be prudish,
we'll never get the book written.

46:42.385 --> 46:44.785
Now, put it down
the way I give it to you.

46:50.794 --> 46:52.819
Good.

46:52.896 --> 46:55.831
Now, at this point,
having had a drink...

46:55.899 --> 46:58.333
I, uh, I went upstairs.

46:58.401 --> 46:59.663
Why?

46:59.736 --> 47:00.828
Why what?

47:00.904 --> 47:02.838
Why did you go upstairs?

47:02.906 --> 47:04.840
Because I saw no harm in it.

47:04.908 --> 47:07.172
You must have been
very young and foolish.

47:07.243 --> 47:08.767
I was young,
but I was never foolish.

47:08.845 --> 47:10.574
Inexperienced, perhaps...

47:10.647 --> 47:14.276
curious, as young men are,
eager for adventure.

47:14.350 --> 47:16.284
I matured early.

47:16.352 --> 47:18.286
I wish I'd known you then.

47:18.354 --> 47:19.787
How old were you, Daniel?

47:19.856 --> 47:22.290
1 6. It was me first voyage.

47:22.358 --> 47:23.791
Only 1 6.

47:23.860 --> 47:26.294
I suppose you'd
run away from home.

47:26.362 --> 47:28.296
Yes. I was an orphan.

47:28.364 --> 47:31.299
Brought up by a maiden aunt
in a country village.

47:31.367 --> 47:33.301
Now, let's get on with it.

47:33.369 --> 47:34.802
Where was I?

47:34.871 --> 47:35.803
Upstairs.

47:35.872 --> 47:37.305
Ah, yes!

47:37.373 --> 47:41.104
The customs of Marseilles
are different to any--

47:41.177 --> 47:42.610
Different from.

47:42.679 --> 47:45.011
To or from, who cares?

47:45.081 --> 47:46.844
This isn't a blasted
literary epic.

47:46.916 --> 47:49.282
It's the unvarnished story
of a seaman's life.

47:49.352 --> 47:51.752
It certainly is unvarnished.

47:51.821 --> 47:54.016
Well, smear on
your own varnish.

47:54.090 --> 47:55.523
Change the grammar
all you please...

47:55.592 --> 47:57.526
but leave the guts in it.

48:00.430 --> 48:02.022
I think it would be nice

48:02.098 --> 48:05.033
if we included a chapter
about your early life...

48:05.101 --> 48:07.035
your school days.

48:07.103 --> 48:10.300
I never went to school.
I was educated by the vicar.

48:10.373 --> 48:12.967
Poor man. He must have
had a dreadful time.

48:13.042 --> 48:15.476
He enjoyed every minute of it...

48:15.545 --> 48:18.981
except for the time
I put a snake in this bed.

48:19.048 --> 48:21.482
You must have been
a horrid little boy.

48:21.551 --> 48:22.984
I suppose you were
a model of all the virtues

48:23.052 --> 48:24.314
when you were 1 2.

48:24.387 --> 48:25.649
Certainly I was.

48:25.722 --> 48:27.485
I won a prize
for deportment at school.

48:27.557 --> 48:29.491
Hmm. I can see you.

48:29.559 --> 48:31.493
Fat little girl
in hair ribbons.

48:31.561 --> 48:32.994
I wasn't fat.
I was skinny.

48:33.062 --> 48:33.994
Just as bad.

48:34.063 --> 48:35.496
And I wore my hair in braids.

48:35.565 --> 48:36.998
And a thousand freckles.

48:38.568 --> 48:41.002
You, uh, you still
have freckles.

48:41.070 --> 48:43.004
Only seven of them...

48:43.072 --> 48:45.666
and I'm told
they're most becoming.

48:47.076 --> 48:49.510
They are at that.

48:49.579 --> 48:52.514
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

48:52.582 --> 48:54.516
Good heavens! 1 1 :OO.

48:54.584 --> 48:56.017
I--

48:56.085 --> 48:59.020
I had no idea
it was so late.

48:59.088 --> 49:02.023
Yes. You had better
be getting some sleep.

49:02.091 --> 49:03.786
We'll put in
a full day tomorrow.

49:06.095 --> 49:10.464
Daniel, what did your aunt do
when you ran away to sea?

49:10.533 --> 49:13.468
Oh, probably thanked heaven
there was no one around

49:13.536 --> 49:14.969
to fill her house
with mongrel puppies

49:15.038 --> 49:17.006
and track mud
on her carpets.

49:17.073 --> 49:18.904
Did she write to you?

49:18.975 --> 49:21.341
Every Sunday for seven years.

49:21.411 --> 49:24.346
I was at sea
when she died.

49:24.414 --> 49:26.314
It was the year
I got me mate's ticket.

49:33.423 --> 49:35.755
What are you
thinking about, Lucia?

49:35.825 --> 49:38.988
I'm thinking how lonely
she must have felt

49:39.062 --> 49:41.622
with her clean carpets.

50:21.404 --> 50:23.338
Seen that Coombe
in the village.

50:23.406 --> 50:24.998
He give me this for you.

50:25.074 --> 50:26.507
Oh, thanks, Martha.

50:26.576 --> 50:28.806
It's another demand
for payment of the rent.

50:28.878 --> 50:30.812
He did say something
about sending the bailiffs

50:30.880 --> 50:32.313
to put us out.

50:32.381 --> 50:35.179
I've got a little money
put by, ma'am.

50:35.251 --> 50:37.310
There ain't been nothing
to spend it on here.

50:37.386 --> 50:38.819
Oh, thank you, Martha...

50:38.888 --> 50:40.822
but I wouldn't dream
of taking it.

50:40.890 --> 50:42.824
We'll manage somehow.

50:42.892 --> 50:44.325
Yes, ma'am.

50:51.601 --> 50:53.831
It's unimportant.
Don't worry about it.

50:53.903 --> 50:55.336
What if he sends the bailiffs?

50:55.404 --> 50:56.837
I'll handle them.

50:56.906 --> 50:58.339
Bailiffs are nothing

50:58.407 --> 51:00.272
but sea lawyers
come ashore.

51:00.343 --> 51:02.277
I'm so tired, Daniel.

51:02.345 --> 51:05.280
I can't see straight
or think straight.

51:05.348 --> 51:06.781
Ah, now then...

51:06.849 --> 51:09.283
there's only one more
chapter to do.

51:09.352 --> 51:11.286
Better be at it.

51:13.356 --> 51:14.516
Lucia!

51:16.359 --> 51:18.293
I'm ready, Daniel.

51:18.361 --> 51:19.794
Good, my dear.

51:24.166 --> 51:25.292
To all who follow

51:25.368 --> 51:28.303
the hard and honorable
profession of the sea...

51:28.371 --> 51:31.306
to the after-guard
and forecastle alike...

51:31.374 --> 51:35.310
to masters, mates,
and engineers...

51:35.378 --> 51:38.313
to able-bodied
and ordinary seamen...

51:38.381 --> 51:41.817
to stokers, apprentices,
ship's boys...

51:41.884 --> 51:44.819
carpenters, sailmakers,
and sea cooks...

51:46.222 --> 51:48.156
I dedicate this volume.

51:49.725 --> 51:50.817
The end.

51:50.893 --> 51:52.326
The end.

51:52.395 --> 51:55.330
Now, tomorrow
you'll take it to the publishers.

51:55.398 --> 51:57.332
I hope they like it.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.163
They must like it.

51:59.235 --> 52:00.759
They will.

52:00.836 --> 52:02.770
It's strange. I--

52:02.838 --> 52:05.773
I didn't think so at first.

52:05.841 --> 52:08.776
Somehow--
Somehow it's a very wise book.

52:08.844 --> 52:12.109
It has elements of wisdom
in it, my dear.

52:12.181 --> 52:14.115
I didn't lead
a very wise life myself...

52:14.183 --> 52:17.778
but it was-- it was a full one
and a grown-up one.

52:19.689 --> 52:23.523
You come of age very quickly
through shipwreck and disaster.

52:24.527 --> 52:27.155
I never understood
the sea before...

52:27.229 --> 52:29.288
or the men who go to sea.

52:30.866 --> 52:32.800
Why did you write
the book, Daniel?

52:32.868 --> 52:35.132
It wasn't merely to
save the house for me.

52:35.204 --> 52:36.296
Partly that.

52:36.372 --> 52:40.809
For you and the retired seamen
you'll leave it to in your will...

52:40.876 --> 52:43.811
but mostly to help
people understand...

52:43.879 --> 52:45.847
to make them understand.

52:45.915 --> 52:48.406
All those
comfortable swabs

52:48.484 --> 52:50.918
who sit at home
in their beam-ends

52:50.987 --> 52:52.511
reveling in the luxuries

52:52.588 --> 52:55.421
that seamen risk their lives
to bring to them...

52:55.491 --> 52:57.425
and despising
the poor devils

52:57.493 --> 53:00.360
if they so much as touch
a drop of rum, and--

53:00.429 --> 53:04.365
and even sneering at people
who try to do them some good

53:04.433 --> 53:06.424
like you and me.

53:11.340 --> 53:13.365
Well, uh...

53:13.442 --> 53:15.876
tomorrow, the publishers.

53:15.945 --> 53:18.379
Tacket and Sproule
in Great Smith Street.

53:18.447 --> 53:20.381
Now be sure you see Sproule.

53:20.449 --> 53:22.713
He owned a small
sailing yacht.

53:22.785 --> 53:24.878
He came in fourth
in a club regatta once

53:24.954 --> 53:28.253
and fancies himself as the very devil
of a seafaring man.

53:28.324 --> 53:29.552
Ha ha ha!

53:29.625 --> 53:33.891
To tell you the truth, he doesn't know
a crossjack from a scuttlebutt.

53:33.963 --> 53:35.396
Yes, Daniel.

53:48.644 --> 53:50.407
Ship out there.

53:50.479 --> 53:52.413
Too close, by the sound.

53:52.481 --> 53:54.745
It's the loneliest sound...

53:54.817 --> 53:57.911
like a child lost
and crying in the dark.

53:57.987 --> 54:00.012
Mmm, he's lost,
all right...

54:00.089 --> 54:02.353
with a captain
cursing a blue streak

54:02.425 --> 54:03.858
and wondering why
he ever went to sea

54:03.926 --> 54:05.689
instead of opening
a grocer's shop

54:05.761 --> 54:07.524
like a sensible man.

54:08.931 --> 54:11.695
Fog in the channel
is treacherous.

54:11.767 --> 54:13.701
I'd rather face
a northeaster.

54:13.769 --> 54:16.363
Still, it's honest, the sea.

54:16.439 --> 54:19.374
It makes you face things
honestly, doesn't it?

54:20.776 --> 54:23.370
There's something
on your mind.

54:23.446 --> 54:24.378
Yes.

54:25.948 --> 54:28.382
What's to become
of us, Daniel?

54:28.451 --> 54:29.884
Of you and me?

54:29.952 --> 54:32.386
Nothing can become of me.

54:32.455 --> 54:35.891
Everything's happened
that can happen.

54:35.958 --> 54:37.892
But not to me.

54:37.960 --> 54:40.394
When we were
writing the book...

54:40.463 --> 54:41.896
I was happy.

54:41.964 --> 54:43.898
We were accomplishing
something together.

54:45.301 --> 54:47.394
Now, when I try to
think about the future...

54:47.470 --> 54:51.406
it's--it's all dark
and confused...

54:51.474 --> 54:54.910
like--like trying
to see into the fog.

54:56.979 --> 55:00.380
You've been working too hard,
cooped up in the house too long.

55:00.449 --> 55:01.848
You need a change of scene.

55:01.917 --> 55:03.350
But I love it here.

55:03.419 --> 55:05.011
You should be out
in the world more...

55:05.087 --> 55:06.520
meeting people.

55:08.791 --> 55:10.190
Seeing men.

55:10.259 --> 55:12.352
I have no desire
to see men.

55:12.428 --> 55:14.362
You should, Lucia.

55:14.430 --> 55:18.127
You're a confoundedly
attractive woman...

55:18.200 --> 55:20.361
or hadn't you noticed?

55:20.436 --> 55:23.667
Really, my dear,
you owe it to yourself.

55:25.941 --> 55:27.374
Yes, Daniel.

55:30.946 --> 55:32.038
Good night.

55:32.114 --> 55:33.376
Good night.

55:35.951 --> 55:37.543
My dear.

55:47.963 --> 55:50.761
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

55:50.833 --> 55:53.734
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

55:56.972 --> 56:00.169
Oh, Daniel, I'm afraid
we've got ourselves

56:00.242 --> 56:02.335
into an awful fix.

56:45.621 --> 56:47.885
I should like to see
Mr. Sproule, please.

56:47.957 --> 56:49.618
I see you're back,
Mr. Fairley.

56:49.692 --> 56:50.624
Obviously.

56:50.693 --> 56:52.388
Have you decided to wait?

56:52.461 --> 56:54.395
Forever if I must.

56:54.463 --> 56:57.227
I should like to see
Mr. Sproule, please.

56:57.299 --> 56:59.392
Can't see Mr. Sproule
without an appointment.

56:59.468 --> 57:01.333
But I have a manuscript.

57:01.403 --> 57:03.098
So you have a manuscript.

57:03.172 --> 57:04.366
Most unusual.

57:04.440 --> 57:06.840
No more so than your adenoids
and your bad manners.

57:06.909 --> 57:09.139
Now, take the lady's name.

57:09.211 --> 57:10.337
Leave your name.

57:10.412 --> 57:11.845
Mrs. Edwin Muir.

57:11.914 --> 57:13.347
Mrs...

57:13.415 --> 57:16.976
Mrs. Edwin Muir.

57:17.052 --> 57:20.351
Gull Cottage,
Whitecliff-by-the-sea.

57:20.422 --> 57:23.357
Can't I have just a few moments
with Mr. Sproule now?

57:23.425 --> 57:25.359
I've come all the way in
from Whitecliff.

57:25.427 --> 57:26.689
[Bell Rings]

57:26.762 --> 57:27.956
All for now.

57:39.942 --> 57:42.206
Is it a cookbook?

57:42.278 --> 57:45.543
I hope not another
life of Byron.

57:45.614 --> 57:47.605
Or is it
a book of dreams?

57:50.452 --> 57:51.885
You're trying
to give me a hint.

57:51.954 --> 57:53.387
Has it something
to do with ice?

57:57.293 --> 57:59.818
Is it really very important
for you to see old Sproule?

57:59.895 --> 58:01.328
Oh, yes, so important.

58:01.397 --> 58:02.830
Then see him you shall...

58:02.898 --> 58:05.890
and it is your good fortune
that I'm not only irresponsible...

58:05.968 --> 58:07.401
but also unreasonable.

58:07.469 --> 58:08.561
I don't understand.

58:08.637 --> 58:10.502
I had an appointment
at 1 1 :OO.

58:10.572 --> 58:12.836
I arrived at 1 O:3O
and wouldn't wait.

58:12.908 --> 58:15.843
I'm only here now because
I followed you back.

58:15.911 --> 58:17.640
So you may have
my appointment...

58:17.713 --> 58:19.476
for which you
are just in time.

58:19.548 --> 58:21.379
That's very good of you,
but I'm afraid I can't--

58:21.450 --> 58:23.315
Now, my dear young woman...

58:23.385 --> 58:25.615
if you will set aside
your book of social graces

58:25.688 --> 58:27.417
for just long enough
to seize an opportunity

58:27.489 --> 58:29.354
that you want very much

58:29.425 --> 58:33.020
by merely indulging a small
natural selfish instinct.

58:33.095 --> 58:35.529
Without doubt, sir, you are
the most forward gentleman

58:35.597 --> 58:36.859
I have ever encountered.

58:36.932 --> 58:38.365
Without doubt.

58:38.434 --> 58:39.867
Mr. Fairley.

58:39.935 --> 58:40.867
Forward.

58:40.936 --> 58:42.369
Oh, no, no.
I couldn't.

58:42.438 --> 58:43.370
It's quite all right.

58:43.439 --> 58:44.599
Oh, no, really.

58:46.942 --> 58:48.466
Here now--

58:48.544 --> 58:51.479
She's mad about you.
Couldn't you tell?

58:51.547 --> 58:53.071
Come in, Fairley.
Come in.

58:53.148 --> 58:54.547
Your new book is terrible...

58:54.616 --> 58:57.642
the most awful trash
I've had on my desk since--

58:57.720 --> 58:59.244
Who are you?

58:59.321 --> 59:02.882
I--I'm-- That is--

59:02.958 --> 59:04.050
Who let you in?

59:04.126 --> 59:06.788
Why, the gentleman outside
said it was all right.

59:06.862 --> 59:08.796
Oh, he did, did he?

59:08.864 --> 59:10.331
Well, it isn't all right...

59:10.399 --> 59:11.923
and I'll trouble you
take yourself elsewhere.

59:12.001 --> 59:14.333
Oh, please, Mr. Sproule.

59:14.403 --> 59:17.099
I simply had to get in
to see you. I--

59:17.172 --> 59:18.332
I have a manuscript.

59:18.407 --> 59:20.204
Of course you have.

59:20.275 --> 59:22.800
2O million discontented females
in the British Isles

59:22.878 --> 59:25.312
and every blessed one of them
is writing a novel.

59:25.381 --> 59:27.645
Don't tell me what's in it.
I know.

59:27.716 --> 59:30.310
Bless my soul, madam,
I've got to publish this bilge

59:30.386 --> 59:33.321
in order to stay in business,
but I don't have to read it.

59:33.389 --> 59:34.822
No, madam, I do not.

59:34.890 --> 59:37.518
And now if you'll pardon me,
I'm busy.

59:37.593 --> 59:39.925
Come back here,
you blasted grampus.!

59:45.567 --> 59:46.829
Madam.

59:46.902 --> 59:48.570
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

59:48.703 --> 59:51.570
You're such
a nice-looking woman, too.

59:51.639 --> 59:54.506
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Sproule.

59:54.576 --> 59:56.510
I didn't mean to say that...

59:56.578 --> 59:58.512
but you're all wrong
about the book.

59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.514
It isn't what you think at all.

01:00:00.582 --> 01:00:02.516
It's...
It's a biography.

01:00:02.584 --> 01:00:06.020
It's the unvarnished record
of a sailor's life.

01:00:06.087 --> 01:00:08.021
A sailor's life, eh?

01:00:10.592 --> 01:00:12.526
I ask your pardon, madam...

01:00:12.594 --> 01:00:14.528
but what do you know
about sailors?

01:00:14.596 --> 01:00:16.530
Oh, a great deal,
believe me.

01:00:16.598 --> 01:00:18.031
Mmm.

01:00:18.099 --> 01:00:20.533
Unvarnished, you say?

01:00:20.602 --> 01:00:24.698
Well, perhaps I have time
for a few pages, at that.

01:00:37.619 --> 01:00:39.052
What's your name?

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.553
Mrs. Muir.

01:00:40.622 --> 01:00:42.055
Hmm.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.553
Heh heh heh!

01:00:52.967 --> 01:00:55.231
Ho ho ho ho!

01:00:55.303 --> 01:00:58.067
I have been waiting here
for three hours.

01:00:58.139 --> 01:01:00.004
I consider it outrageous!

01:01:12.153 --> 01:01:13.586
Still in there?

01:01:13.655 --> 01:01:15.589
Sent luncheon in at 2:OO.

01:01:15.657 --> 01:01:17.022
For two?

01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:29.695
Well! You're not going to pretend
that you wrote this.

01:01:29.771 --> 01:01:31.568
No.

01:01:31.639 --> 01:01:33.766
No. It's a man's book...

01:01:33.841 --> 01:01:35.502
and what a man.

01:01:35.576 --> 01:01:37.976
Is he-- Is he your husband,
Mrs. Muir?

01:01:38.046 --> 01:01:41.504
Oh, no.

01:01:41.582 --> 01:01:44.881
This Captain X,
I'd like very much to meet him.

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:47.546
Oh, I'm afraid
that's impossible.

01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:49.556
He's--He's away.

01:01:49.624 --> 01:01:51.558
On a voyage, of course.

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:53.321
Yes. A very long voyage.

01:01:53.394 --> 01:01:56.557
Bless my soul,
what a yarn!

01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:58.565
What a life!

01:01:58.633 --> 01:02:00.498
I'll tell you a secret.

01:02:00.568 --> 01:02:03.503
If I hadn't had a mother
and two sisters to support...

01:02:03.571 --> 01:02:05.505
I'd have gone
to sea myself.

01:02:05.573 --> 01:02:08.508
Bless my soul,
to live like that!

01:02:08.576 --> 01:02:11.010
Instead of sitting there
turning out

01:02:11.079 --> 01:02:13.513
indigestible reading matter
for a bilious public.

01:02:13.581 --> 01:02:15.014
Tsk tsk tsk!

01:02:15.083 --> 01:02:17.517
Of course we'll publish it,
Mrs. Muir.

01:02:17.585 --> 01:02:19.519
Now, you're empowered by
the captain to act for him?

01:02:19.587 --> 01:02:21.521
Yes. He's given me the rights.

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:23.523
Good. Well, my dear...

01:02:23.591 --> 01:02:26.025
you presented me
with a most enjoyable day.

01:02:26.094 --> 01:02:28.528
Bless my soul,
yes, remarkable.

01:02:28.596 --> 01:02:31.030
Now, you just leave
everything to me

01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:33.033
and be happy that
you know such a man.

01:02:33.101 --> 01:02:35.535
There aren't many
like him these days.

01:02:35.603 --> 01:02:37.195
You appreciate that?

01:02:37.271 --> 01:02:40.035
Yes, I think so.

01:02:40.108 --> 01:02:42.042
Well, goodbye, Mr. Sproule.

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.543
Goodbye, Mrs. Muir.

01:02:43.611 --> 01:02:44.737
Goodbye.

01:02:50.952 --> 01:02:52.544
Mr. Fairley.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.053
Coming.

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:11.004
It's easy to understand

01:03:11.072 --> 01:03:13.006
why the most beautiful poems
about England in the spring

01:03:13.074 --> 01:03:15.008
were written by poets
living in Italy at the time.

01:03:15.076 --> 01:03:16.509
How do you do?

01:03:16.577 --> 01:03:18.511
I'm not a poet,
but I've got an umbrella...

01:03:18.579 --> 01:03:20.513
and your hat,
if I may say so...

01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:22.515
is singularly inadequate
under the circumstances.

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:25.518
I didn't bargain
for this blasted rain.

01:03:25.586 --> 01:03:27.520
That is, I'm afraid
I shall be late

01:03:27.588 --> 01:03:30.022
and miss the last train
for home.

01:03:30.091 --> 01:03:33.527
I could call you a cab...

01:03:33.594 --> 01:03:35.528
if you ask nicely.

01:03:39.267 --> 01:03:40.529
Oy! Cab!

01:03:54.115 --> 01:03:55.047
Where to?

01:03:55.116 --> 01:03:56.549
Victoria.

01:03:56.617 --> 01:03:59.051
Victoria. What a coincidence.
Victoria, cabby.

01:04:02.824 --> 01:04:05.452
I know you won't mind
Sharing my cab with me, will you?

01:04:05.526 --> 01:04:07.118
Not at all.

01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:12.965
The word you're
looking for is ""brass.''

01:04:13.034 --> 01:04:14.467
Brass?

01:04:14.535 --> 01:04:16.469
To describe
my behavior and me.

01:04:16.537 --> 01:04:18.471
You don't approve
of either, do you?

01:04:18.539 --> 01:04:19.972
Not very much.

01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:22.475
Still, in a way
I should be grateful to you.

01:04:22.543 --> 01:04:24.238
Of course...why?

01:04:24.312 --> 01:04:27.611
Because Mr. Sproule
has agreed to publish my book.

01:04:27.682 --> 01:04:29.479
Splendid. So the old boy

01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:32.485
has developed a weakness
for feminine literature, has he?

01:04:32.553 --> 01:04:34.987
I can't say
that it's one of mine.

01:04:35.056 --> 01:04:37.991
This book
might surprise you.

01:04:38.059 --> 01:04:39.651
It's surprising enough

01:04:39.727 --> 01:04:41.991
to find a lady author
infinitely more exciting

01:04:42.063 --> 01:04:45.999
than her heroine
could possibly be.

01:04:46.067 --> 01:04:48.501
Do you write, Mr., uh...

01:04:48.569 --> 01:04:51.037
My name is Miles Fairley.
Yes, I write a little.

01:04:51.105 --> 01:04:52.504
Children's books.

01:04:52.573 --> 01:04:55.007
Children's books? You?

01:04:55.076 --> 01:04:57.010
I should like to see one.

01:04:57.078 --> 01:04:59.012
I'm afraid you already have.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.948
I write under the name
of Uncle Neddy.

01:05:03.017 --> 01:05:05.952
Uncle Neddy?
You're Uncle Neddy?

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.954
Ridiculous, isn't it?

01:05:08.022 --> 01:05:10.957
Then all of your cynicism
must be nothing but a pose.

01:05:11.025 --> 01:05:13.960
You're adored by half
the children in the world.

01:05:14.028 --> 01:05:15.791
Uncle Neddy is a pose.

01:05:15.863 --> 01:05:17.797
Deep in
my innermost heart...

01:05:17.865 --> 01:05:19.799
I loathe
the little monsters.

01:05:19.867 --> 01:05:22.961
My little daughter
is not a monster...

01:05:23.037 --> 01:05:24.971
and she'll be
very excited to know

01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:27.974
I've been talking
to her favorite author.

01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:30.476
I shall make an exception
of your daughter.

01:05:30.545 --> 01:05:32.479
I'm looking forward
to meeting her

01:05:32.547 --> 01:05:34.481
and your husband, too.

01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:36.483
My husband is dead.

01:05:36.551 --> 01:05:38.485
Oh.

01:05:38.553 --> 01:05:39.747
Oh?

01:05:41.389 --> 01:05:44.483
Oh, I do wish he'd hurry.

01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:47.323
Well, there's no rush now.

01:05:47.395 --> 01:05:49.488
We'll get there in time.

01:05:54.735 --> 01:05:56.327
Here's an empty one.

01:05:59.574 --> 01:06:01.439
Well, goodbye, Mrs. Muir.

01:06:01.509 --> 01:06:04.444
Goodbye, Mr. Fairley,
and thank you very much.

01:06:04.512 --> 01:06:06.446
Not at all.
Are you all right?

01:06:06.514 --> 01:06:08.948
Oh, yes, quite all right.
Thank you.

01:06:09.016 --> 01:06:11.450
Cheero!

01:06:11.519 --> 01:06:12.952
[Engine Chugging]

01:06:42.383 --> 01:06:43.975
[Captain Gregg]
Cheero.

01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:46.986
Oh. You've been
eavesdropping.

01:06:47.054 --> 01:06:48.988
Feminine literature.

01:06:49.056 --> 01:06:50.990
What's he mean,
feminine literature?

01:06:51.058 --> 01:06:52.992
He had no way of knowing
it's your book.

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.493
Brass, he says.

01:06:54.562 --> 01:06:56.996
I'll polish his brass for him.

01:06:57.064 --> 01:06:58.998
And the way he was
smirking at you...

01:06:59.066 --> 01:07:00.931
like a cat
at a fishmonger's.

01:07:01.002 --> 01:07:03.436
You should have
slapped his face.

01:07:03.504 --> 01:07:05.938
Why? I found him
rather charming.

01:07:06.007 --> 01:07:08.942
Rather charming. Now you're
starting to talk like him.

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.944
How in blazes
do you want me to talk?

01:07:11.012 --> 01:07:11.979
That's better.

01:07:12.046 --> 01:07:13.946
I think you're being
extremely childish.

01:07:14.015 --> 01:07:15.949
I'm only trying to
protect you

01:07:16.017 --> 01:07:17.780
from your
own worse instincts.

01:07:17.852 --> 01:07:19.615
I'll manage my own instincts,
thank you.

01:07:19.687 --> 01:07:21.712
What made you lie
to the blighter?

01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:23.120
I didn't lie to him.

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:25.124
You did. You told him
he was Anna's favorite author.

01:07:25.192 --> 01:07:27.126
You know perfectly well
she hates Uncle Neddy

01:07:27.194 --> 01:07:29.924
and reads nothing but Deadeye Dick,
the Rover of the Spanish Main.

01:07:29.997 --> 01:07:31.965
Well, I had to say something.

01:07:32.033 --> 01:07:35.469
Hmm. You should have
pushed him out of the cab.

01:07:35.536 --> 01:07:38.130
In another minute,
I would have.

01:07:38.205 --> 01:07:41.436
Why, Daniel,
I believe you're jealous.

01:07:41.509 --> 01:07:43.443
Of course
I'm not jealous!

01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:45.479
Do you take me
for a blasted schoolboy?

01:07:45.546 --> 01:07:48.106
Besides,jealousy
is a disease of the flesh.

01:07:48.182 --> 01:07:50.946
I've never known you
to be so disagreeable...

01:07:51.018 --> 01:07:52.815
today of all days.

01:07:52.887 --> 01:07:54.787
What's so wonderful
about today?

01:07:54.855 --> 01:07:56.288
The book, Daniel.

01:07:56.357 --> 01:07:58.120
Mr. Sproule liked the book.

01:07:58.192 --> 01:08:00.387
Of course he liked it.

01:08:00.461 --> 01:08:02.929
And now I can buy
the house.

01:08:02.997 --> 01:08:04.555
[Whistle Blows]

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.434
Just as we planned.

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:09.935
I'm not sure
I want you to have

01:08:10.004 --> 01:08:11.596
the blasted house after all.

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:13.936
Oh, Daniel, please.

01:08:14.008 --> 01:08:17.444
Oh, I suppose being a woman,
you can't help it.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:18.944
Can't help what?

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:20.947
Making a fool of yourself.

01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:23.448
Daniel, you stop sulking.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:26.452
You yourself said that
I should mix with people...

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.113
that I should see...men.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.953
I said men, not perfumed
parlor snakes.

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:34.961
He's a man
and a very nice one.

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:37.895
Anyway, I shall never
see him again.

01:08:37.965 --> 01:08:38.897
Hmm.

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:43.466
Cheer off, you blasted mud turtle!
There's no room!

01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:45.630
I beg your pardon, madam.

01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:56.640
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:59.652
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:09.593
[Children Laughing]

01:09:12.337 --> 01:09:15.273
Will my name stay there
forever, Mr. Scroggins?

01:09:15.341 --> 01:09:17.274
Mm-hmm.
Forever and a day...

01:09:17.343 --> 01:09:19.277
and I've cut it
nice and deep

01:09:19.345 --> 01:09:22.781
so all the ships at sea
can see it as they sail along.

01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:25.283
My goodness!

01:09:32.692 --> 01:09:33.920
Mummy!

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:39.287
Mummy, come and see
what Mr. Scroggins has done!

01:09:39.365 --> 01:09:41.595
I'll be right out, darling!

01:10:01.688 --> 01:10:03.781
Mr. Scroggins says
I'll always be here...

01:10:03.857 --> 01:10:05.791
and all the captains
of all the ships

01:10:05.859 --> 01:10:08.123
will look at me
through spyglasses.

01:10:08.194 --> 01:10:10.128
Why, that's very thoughtful
of Mr. Scroggins.

01:10:10.196 --> 01:10:12.130
Just think of all
the lovely shipwrecks

01:10:12.198 --> 01:10:13.961
we'll have on this beach.

01:10:14.033 --> 01:10:16.126
Now, in the meantime,
what do you say to getting dressed

01:10:16.202 --> 01:10:18.136
and plotting
our course for home?

01:10:18.204 --> 01:10:20.138
Oh, please, Mummy!
Mr. Scroggins and I

01:10:20.206 --> 01:10:22.140
have got to build
a breakwater and a canal!

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:24.142
I'll be pleased
to bring her home, ma'am.

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:27.145
All right, Skipper,
but mind you're not too late.

01:11:10.523 --> 01:11:13.617
Life is just one coincidence
after another, isn't it?

01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:15.627
Thank you for returning
my handkerchief, Mr. Fairley.

01:11:15.695 --> 01:11:17.629
I feel rather ashamed
about having taken it.

01:11:17.697 --> 01:11:18.629
You should be.

01:11:18.698 --> 01:11:20.131
Only as a writer,
of course.

01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:21.689
It was much
too obvious a device.

01:11:21.768 --> 01:11:23.133
And in questionable taste.

01:11:23.202 --> 01:11:24.794
But very necessary.

01:11:24.871 --> 01:11:26.634
I wanted to have
something of you

01:11:26.706 --> 01:11:28.367
until I saw you again.

01:11:31.978 --> 01:11:34.310
You're quite accomplished,
aren't you?

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.143
I should think
being Uncle Neddy

01:11:36.215 --> 01:11:38.149
would satisfy anyone.

01:11:38.217 --> 01:11:40.151
No. I also paint...

01:11:40.219 --> 01:11:42.153
under the name of Renoir.

01:11:42.221 --> 01:11:43.654
Oh, you're such a fool.

01:11:43.723 --> 01:11:45.657
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

01:11:45.725 --> 01:11:47.818
And what, if anything,
do you do as Miles Fairley?

01:11:47.894 --> 01:11:49.623
Play the fool, generally.

01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:51.630
Specifically, I behave
quite idiotically

01:11:51.698 --> 01:11:54.132
towards a certain young lady
that I fell in love with

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.259
while passing on a stair.

01:11:56.336 --> 01:11:57.963
Mr. Fairley, please.

01:11:58.037 --> 01:11:59.937
I have no illusions
about my conduct.

01:12:00.006 --> 01:12:03.533
Am I being unforgivably
offensive, Lucy?

01:12:03.609 --> 01:12:05.008
Lucy?

01:12:05.078 --> 01:12:07.012
That's your name.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.516
It's been so long
since anyone called me that.

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:14.019
No, you've done nothing
really unforgivable.

01:12:14.087 --> 01:12:17.022
It's just that I'm not--

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:19.581
Come and take a look
at my canvas.

01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:23.591
Why, it's me.

01:12:23.663 --> 01:12:26.097
You've been painting me.

01:12:26.165 --> 01:12:28.099
You've been
watching me bathe.

01:12:28.167 --> 01:12:30.601
But always from
a respectable distance.

01:12:32.472 --> 01:12:35.305
Not too bad, is it?

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:39.607
I think
it's very flattering, really--

01:12:39.679 --> 01:12:42.614
It will need
a thousand Renoirs.

01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:52.123
That was unforgivable,
wasn't it?

01:12:53.893 --> 01:12:56.327
But I shall not go away,
even if you send me...

01:12:56.396 --> 01:13:00.127
and I shall see you again,
even if you forbid it.

01:13:00.199 --> 01:13:03.066
I'm sure I have no control
over where you go or...

01:13:03.136 --> 01:13:05.570
or what you do.

01:13:05.638 --> 01:13:07.572
Then you won't forbid it.

01:13:32.231 --> 01:13:35.394
So now you've been kissed
in the orchard all over again.

01:13:35.468 --> 01:13:36.901
You've been spying on me.

01:13:36.969 --> 01:13:39.096
I merely happened to be
cruising in the vicinity.

01:13:39.172 --> 01:13:40.332
I don't believe you.

01:13:40.406 --> 01:13:41.771
Why did you let him?

01:13:41.841 --> 01:13:45.004
I--I didn't.
He took me unaware.

01:13:45.078 --> 01:13:48.605
Ha ha ha! My dear,
since eve picked the apple...

01:13:48.681 --> 01:13:51.616
no woman's ever been
taken entirely unawares.

01:13:51.684 --> 01:13:54.118
Just what do you mean
to insinuate by that?

01:13:54.187 --> 01:13:55.620
When a woman's kissed...

01:13:55.688 --> 01:13:58.122
it's because deep down
she wants to be kissed.

01:13:58.191 --> 01:14:00.625
That is nothing
but masculine conceit.

01:14:00.693 --> 01:14:02.558
Nevertheless, it's true.

01:14:02.628 --> 01:14:04.562
Well, now what happens?

01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:06.564
He'll stay, or he'll go away.

01:14:06.632 --> 01:14:09.066
It doesn't matter to me
one way or the other.

01:14:09.135 --> 01:14:11.569
I think it matters to you
more than you'll admit.

01:14:11.637 --> 01:14:13.229
Isn't that so, Lucia?

01:14:13.306 --> 01:14:15.069
Why bother
to ask me, Daniel?

01:14:15.141 --> 01:14:18.076
You seem to know my mind
better than I do.

01:14:18.144 --> 01:14:20.578
You don't like him, do you?

01:14:20.646 --> 01:14:22.580
He puts brilliantine
on his hair.

01:14:22.648 --> 01:14:24.081
Most men do.

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:26.584
And he uses perfume.
Blasted near drove me
out of his room.

01:14:26.652 --> 01:14:28.586
You shouldn't have been
in his room in the first place.

01:14:28.654 --> 01:14:30.588
So you can find an excuse
for everything.

01:14:30.656 --> 01:14:32.590
Only because you're
attacking him, Daniel.

01:14:32.658 --> 01:14:34.592
I know. It's a natural
human reaction.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.594
I wish you
wouldn't be so superior

01:14:36.662 --> 01:14:39.096
just because
you're...not alive.

01:14:39.165 --> 01:14:40.598
And he is,
very much so.

01:14:40.666 --> 01:14:42.395
It's no crime to be alive.

01:14:42.468 --> 01:14:45.596
No, my dear. Sometimes
it's a great inconvenience.

01:14:45.671 --> 01:14:47.434
The living can be hurt.

01:14:47.507 --> 01:14:49.600
I don't intend to be hurt.

01:14:49.675 --> 01:14:52.473
No captain intends to pile his ship
up on a reef, but it happens.

01:14:52.545 --> 01:14:55.275
You yourself said I should
go about in the world.

01:14:55.348 --> 01:14:57.111
That means taking risks.

01:14:57.183 --> 01:14:59.117
I know, my dear.

01:14:59.185 --> 01:15:02.052
Real happiness is
worth almost any risk...

01:15:02.121 --> 01:15:03.884
but be careful.

01:15:03.956 --> 01:15:06.686
There may be
breakers ahead.

01:15:08.961 --> 01:15:10.485
I will, Daniel.

01:15:31.817 --> 01:15:32.909
[Footsteps]

01:15:40.159 --> 01:15:41.592
Hello, Martha.

01:15:41.661 --> 01:15:42.593
Hello.

01:15:42.662 --> 01:15:44.095
Like my picture?

01:15:44.163 --> 01:15:45.289
No.

01:15:45.364 --> 01:15:47.264
That's honest, anyway.

01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:49.767
It's indecent,
that's what it is.

01:15:49.835 --> 01:15:53.430
Him painting you in your
bathing costume like you was a...

01:15:53.506 --> 01:15:54.939
I don't know what.

01:15:55.007 --> 01:15:57.942
Oh, come, Martha.
This is the 2Oth century.

01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:01.707
We must rid ourselves
of the old fetishes and taboos.

01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:04.545
Huh! Learnt a lot
of new words, ain't you?

01:16:04.617 --> 01:16:07.051
We're never
too old to learn.

01:16:07.119 --> 01:16:09.553
No. Nor to make fools
of ourselves either.

01:16:09.622 --> 01:16:11.055
""Uncle Neddy.''

01:16:11.123 --> 01:16:13.717
All right, my girl.
Let's have it.

01:16:13.793 --> 01:16:17.058
What's he up to?
What's he want with you?

01:16:17.129 --> 01:16:21.566
Well, I rather think he's going
to ask me to marry him.

01:16:21.634 --> 01:16:23.067
And you'd be willing to.

01:16:23.135 --> 01:16:25.069
I might.
Why shouldn't I?

01:16:25.137 --> 01:16:27.571
Because he ain't good enough
for you, that's why not.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.575
He's the kind of man
no decent woman
would associate with.

01:16:30.643 --> 01:16:32.577
Martha, what right have you
to talk like that?

01:16:32.645 --> 01:16:34.078
Well, I got a right
to me own feelings...

01:16:34.146 --> 01:16:35.579
and I got a feeling about him.

01:16:35.648 --> 01:16:37.081
How dare you!

01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:38.582
I'm sorry.

01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:43.088
It's just that I've been
so worried about you lately.

01:16:43.155 --> 01:16:46.591
Now, Martha.
There's nothing to worry about.

01:16:46.659 --> 01:16:49.253
I know he isn't perfect.

01:16:49.328 --> 01:16:53.594
Perhaps he's conceited
and erratic...

01:16:53.666 --> 01:16:55.600
even childish...

01:16:55.668 --> 01:16:57.465
but he's real.

01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:00.937
Real?

01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:03.771
I thought I was impervious
to emotion...

01:17:03.843 --> 01:17:06.778
a respectable widow woman
with a growing child

01:17:06.846 --> 01:17:09.280
and a hide
like a rhinoceros...

01:17:09.348 --> 01:17:10.940
but I'm not.

01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:13.781
I need companionship
and laughter

01:17:13.853 --> 01:17:16.947
and all the things
a woman needs.

01:17:18.524 --> 01:17:21.391
I suppose I need love.

01:17:22.528 --> 01:17:25.964
Well, I hope
he can give it to you.

01:17:26.032 --> 01:17:28.466
Now, suppose you
go on downstairs

01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:31.469
and make us both
a cup of tea.

01:17:32.705 --> 01:17:34.138
I'll finish up.

01:17:34.206 --> 01:17:35.639
Yes, ma'am.

01:17:54.727 --> 01:17:56.160
Well, Daniel...

01:17:59.565 --> 01:18:02.056
haven't you anything to say?

01:18:13.179 --> 01:18:14.441
Happy?

01:18:14.513 --> 01:18:17.448
Oh, I've never
felt like this before.

01:18:17.516 --> 01:18:18.448
How?

01:18:18.517 --> 01:18:19.950
I don't know.

01:18:20.019 --> 01:18:21.452
Tell me.

01:18:23.522 --> 01:18:27.458
Like...Like looking
down from high up...

01:18:27.526 --> 01:18:29.960
all dizzy and unsure.

01:18:30.029 --> 01:18:32.463
You won't fall.
I'll hold you.

01:18:32.531 --> 01:18:36.467
It isn't right, it can't be,
to feel like this...

01:18:36.535 --> 01:18:38.469
like...I don't know.

01:18:38.537 --> 01:18:41.131
It is right
because you're happy.

01:18:46.545 --> 01:18:49.912
Martha's gone up.
It's Anna's bedtime.

01:18:49.982 --> 01:18:52.576
Just this once,
pretend you've forgotten.

01:18:52.651 --> 01:18:54.482
But I didn't.

01:18:54.553 --> 01:18:56.282
Just this one night.

01:18:57.656 --> 01:19:00.090
There'll be so many nights,
darling...

01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:03.026
two lifetimesful,
till we're both old

01:19:03.095 --> 01:19:06.030
and even Anna's
grown and married, too.

01:19:06.098 --> 01:19:07.531
What's wrong?

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.033
I'm jealous.

01:19:09.101 --> 01:19:12.036
I'm even jealous
of a little girl.

01:19:12.104 --> 01:19:13.537
But she's my daughter.

01:19:13.606 --> 01:19:16.541
I can't just forget
my duty to her.

01:19:16.609 --> 01:19:18.042
When you're with me...

01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:20.544
I want you to forget about
everyone else in the world...

01:19:20.613 --> 01:19:22.547
your duty, and what
the world will say.

01:19:22.615 --> 01:19:24.549
I think you
must be a magician.

01:19:24.617 --> 01:19:27.051
You make it seem all wrong
to consider my duty

01:19:27.119 --> 01:19:29.144
and only right that I...

01:19:44.804 --> 01:19:46.439
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

01:19:46.439 --> 01:19:47.531
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

01:19:47.606 --> 01:19:50.541
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

01:19:50.609 --> 01:19:54.375
I thought you were
one woman with sense...

01:19:54.447 --> 01:19:57.416
but you're like
all the rest of them.

01:19:57.483 --> 01:20:01.010
Fall for any man
who'll promise you the moon

01:20:01.086 --> 01:20:04.285
and end by taking everything
you have to give.

01:20:06.787 --> 01:20:10.018
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
my dear.

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:12.024
It's not your fault.

01:20:12.092 --> 01:20:15.528
I should have known
it was on the chart.

01:20:15.596 --> 01:20:17.530
You've made your choice...

01:20:17.598 --> 01:20:20.032
the only choice
you could make.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.533
You've chosen life...

01:20:21.602 --> 01:20:24.036
and that's as it should be...

01:20:24.104 --> 01:20:26.072
whatever the reckoning.

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:29.541
And that's why
I'm going away, my dear.

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:32.545
Oh, I...I can't help you now.

01:20:32.613 --> 01:20:35.047
I can only confuse you more

01:20:35.115 --> 01:20:38.551
and destroy whatever chance
you have left of happiness.

01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:40.780
You must make your own life

01:20:40.854 --> 01:20:43.220
amongst the living.

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:48.060
And whether you'll meet
fair winds or foul...

01:20:48.128 --> 01:20:53.896
find your own way to harbor
in the end.

01:20:59.073 --> 01:21:02.338
Lucia, listen to me.

01:21:02.409 --> 01:21:04.502
Listen, my dear.

01:21:04.578 --> 01:21:07.012
You've been dreaming...

01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:09.015
dreaming of a sea captain

01:21:09.083 --> 01:21:11.017
that haunted this house...

01:21:11.085 --> 01:21:13.519
of talks you had with him...

01:21:13.587 --> 01:21:17.023
even a book
you both wrote together...

01:21:17.091 --> 01:21:22.028
but, Lucia,
you wrote the book...

01:21:22.096 --> 01:21:26.089
you and no one else--

01:21:26.166 --> 01:21:29.033
The book you imagined
from his house...

01:21:29.103 --> 01:21:31.537
from his picture
on the wall...

01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:34.540
from his gear
lying around in every room.

01:21:38.612 --> 01:21:42.207
It's been a dream, Lucia.

01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:53.555
And in the morning
and the years after...

01:21:53.627 --> 01:21:57.290
you'll only remember it
as a dream...

01:21:57.364 --> 01:21:59.992
and it'll die...

01:22:00.067 --> 01:22:03.764
as all dreams
must die at waking.

01:22:11.845 --> 01:22:15.110
How you'd have
loved the North Cape

01:22:15.182 --> 01:22:18.242
and the fjords and
the midnight sun...

01:22:18.318 --> 01:22:21.185
to sail across the reef
at Barbados...

01:22:21.255 --> 01:22:24.190
where the blue water
turns to green...

01:22:24.258 --> 01:22:25.691
to the Falklands

01:22:25.759 --> 01:22:29.195
where a southerly gale
rips the whole sea white!

01:22:29.263 --> 01:22:32.699
What we've missed, Lucia!

01:22:33.934 --> 01:22:37.392
What we've both missed.

01:22:40.441 --> 01:22:44.537
Goodbye, my darling.

01:23:03.564 --> 01:23:07.000
Listen to this.
From Mr. Sproule.

01:23:07.067 --> 01:23:09.831
It's about the book
I've written.

01:23:09.903 --> 01:23:14.169
""Our check for 1 OO
advance royalties

01:23:14.241 --> 01:23:15.674
as you requested.''

01:23:15.742 --> 01:23:20.509
You mean to tell me they paid you
good money for that?

01:23:20.581 --> 01:23:23.015
Martha, have you
been reading my book?

01:23:23.083 --> 01:23:24.516
I'm supposed
to dust in here...

01:23:24.585 --> 01:23:26.519
and what falls under me eye
falls under me eye.

01:23:26.587 --> 01:23:29.021
I'm surprised at you.
It's like eavesdropping.

01:23:29.089 --> 01:23:32.024
I'm surprised at you.
Such language! Lummy.

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:34.526
Well, if you're writing
about a sea captain...

01:23:34.595 --> 01:23:37.496
you have to use the sort
of language he would use.

01:23:37.564 --> 01:23:40.692
He'd have a hard time
living up to your idea of him.

01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:44.533
Mr. Sproule wants me to come
into town to sign some papers...

01:23:44.605 --> 01:23:48.041
but I...I can't possibly
leave here now just when--

01:23:48.108 --> 01:23:49.507
Just when what?

01:23:49.576 --> 01:23:52.044
I'm expecting Mr. Fairley.

01:23:52.112 --> 01:23:54.603
We're having a picnic.

01:23:54.681 --> 01:23:56.808
You mean he is.

01:23:56.884 --> 01:23:59.375
I heard you, Martha.

01:23:59.453 --> 01:24:02.650
Please remember
that I'm going to marry him.

01:24:02.723 --> 01:24:04.156
Yes, ma'am.

01:24:06.059 --> 01:24:08.653
By the way,
I've been thinking

01:24:08.729 --> 01:24:12.825
we might put that portrait
of Captain Gregg up in the attic.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.663
Don't you like it anymore?

01:24:14.735 --> 01:24:17.499
It was a silly idea
to hang it in here.

01:24:17.571 --> 01:24:20.506
I--I don't know
what possessed me.

01:24:20.574 --> 01:24:22.007
Atmosphere, I suppose.

01:24:22.075 --> 01:24:23.337
Yes, ma'am.

01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:26.004
I'll hang it in my room,
if you don't mind.

01:24:26.079 --> 01:24:27.512
Of course not.

01:24:27.581 --> 01:24:29.515
Perhaps you can
get Uncle Neddy

01:24:29.583 --> 01:24:31.016
to paint one
of himself instead.

01:24:31.084 --> 01:24:32.016
Martha!

01:24:44.264 --> 01:24:45.697
""Dear Mr. Sproule...

01:24:45.766 --> 01:24:50.203
""I find that I am unable to leave
Whitecliff this week

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:53.364
and hope that you...''

01:24:57.945 --> 01:25:00.880
A boy brought
a note for you.

01:25:07.888 --> 01:25:10.322
A billet-doux,
I dare say.

01:25:15.062 --> 01:25:16.495
Oh, how terrible.

01:25:16.563 --> 01:25:21.500
Mr. Fairley has been called up
to London for a few days.

01:25:21.568 --> 01:25:23.502
What's so terrible about that?

01:25:37.584 --> 01:25:38.516
There!

01:25:38.585 --> 01:25:40.519
Is that all,
Mr. Sproule?

01:25:40.587 --> 01:25:45.024
Except to deposit the checks
to your account when they come in.

01:25:45.092 --> 01:25:47.026
I congratulate you, my dear...

01:25:47.094 --> 01:25:49.528
and I congratulate
the captain, too.

01:25:49.596 --> 01:25:51.029
Oh, the captain.

01:25:51.098 --> 01:25:54.864
And I intend to hold you
to your promise to introduce us.

01:25:54.935 --> 01:25:57.529
Oh, yes,
I did promise, didn't I?

01:25:57.604 --> 01:25:59.037
You know...

01:25:59.106 --> 01:26:01.973
someday when I've known you
a little longer, Mr. Sproule...

01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:04.476
I'll tell you the truth
about the captain.

01:26:04.544 --> 01:26:06.307
Goodbye
and thank you again.

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.007
Goodbye, Mrs. Muir.

01:26:12.552 --> 01:26:15.487
Would you please give me
Mr. Fairley's address?

01:26:15.555 --> 01:26:16.988
Miles Fairley?

01:26:17.057 --> 01:26:18.490
Yes, please.

01:26:20.394 --> 01:26:22.828
Uh, here it is, Mrs. Muir.

01:26:22.896 --> 01:26:24.830
Number 1 4,
Albemarle Street.

01:26:24.898 --> 01:26:26.832
Thank you so much.

01:26:48.255 --> 01:26:49.187
[Ring]

01:26:51.758 --> 01:26:53.020
Yes, ma'am?

01:26:53.093 --> 01:26:55.186
I'd like to see
Mr. Fairley, please.

01:26:55.262 --> 01:26:56.524
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:59.266 --> 01:27:00.699
What name, please?

01:27:00.767 --> 01:27:02.132
It's Mrs. Muir.

01:27:02.202 --> 01:27:05.137
Yes, ma'am.
Will you wait in there, please?

01:27:32.733 --> 01:27:36.829
Mrs. Muir? The maid said
you wanted to see my husband.

01:27:36.903 --> 01:27:38.871
Perhaps I can help you.

01:27:38.939 --> 01:27:40.668
Husband?

01:27:40.741 --> 01:27:42.868
Or if you don't mind waiting.

01:27:42.943 --> 01:27:44.035
He should be back soon.

01:27:44.111 --> 01:27:46.045
He's taking the children
to the park.

01:27:46.113 --> 01:27:50.550
I've had them abroad
for the past few months.
We just returned.

01:27:50.617 --> 01:27:53.552
Miles is making up
for lost time.

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.053
Please sit down.

01:27:55.122 --> 01:28:00.059
If you're a friend of his, you know
how fond he is of the children.

01:28:00.127 --> 01:28:02.618
You are a friend of his,
aren't you?

01:28:02.696 --> 01:28:04.823
I--I'm a writer.

01:28:04.898 --> 01:28:08.891
We, uh... Mr. Fairley and I
have the same publisher.

01:28:08.969 --> 01:28:10.493
How exciting.

01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:14.939
I don't often meet
one of Miles' literary friends.

01:28:15.008 --> 01:28:17.499
You'll wait for him,
won't you?

01:28:17.577 --> 01:28:20.740
I expect him back any minute,
and we'll have tea.

01:28:20.814 --> 01:28:22.338
No, I...

01:28:22.416 --> 01:28:23.678
I'll go.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:25.513
I'm afraid
I've made a mistake.

01:28:25.585 --> 01:28:27.018
Mistake, Mrs. Muir?

01:28:27.087 --> 01:28:29.021
Yes. I--I'm sorry.

01:28:30.524 --> 01:28:33.015
I think I understand,
my dear...

01:28:33.093 --> 01:28:35.288
and I'm sorry, too.

01:28:35.362 --> 01:28:36.852
Truly I am.

01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:42.527
You see, it isn't the first time
something like this has happened.

01:28:47.707 --> 01:28:48.765
Mrs. Muir.

01:29:37.758 --> 01:29:39.692
Come on in, ma'am.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.695
I brought you
some nice hot milk.

01:29:42.763 --> 01:29:44.196
[Crying]

01:29:48.102 --> 01:29:50.036
Oh, there, there.

01:29:50.104 --> 01:29:54.040
He ain't worth it.
Blast his hide.

01:29:54.108 --> 01:29:56.542
He ain't worth it.

01:30:15.963 --> 01:30:17.396
[Arf Arf]

01:30:17.464 --> 01:30:17.898
[Arf Arf]

01:30:17.898 --> 01:30:18.887
[Arf Arf]

01:30:18.966 --> 01:30:20.399
[Arf Arf]

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:28.073
Where you been?

01:30:28.142 --> 01:30:29.575
Just walking.

01:30:29.643 --> 01:30:32.578
You've been doing a lot of walking
these last few months.

01:30:32.646 --> 01:30:34.580
You mustn't go
tiring yourself out, now.

01:30:34.648 --> 01:30:36.582
I'm not a bit tired.

01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:38.584
Off to your room

01:30:38.652 --> 01:30:41.587
and a nice bit
of shut-eye before tea.

01:30:45.959 --> 01:30:48.427
Martha, do you know
what day this is?

01:30:48.495 --> 01:30:49.928
Wash day.

01:30:49.997 --> 01:30:54.434
Yes, but it was exactly a year ago
that we came here.

01:30:54.501 --> 01:30:56.935
We went up
these stairs together...

01:30:57.004 --> 01:31:00.440
and then I hurt my finger
on the window.

01:31:00.507 --> 01:31:01.906
Remember?

01:31:01.975 --> 01:31:02.942
Yes, ma'am.

01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:04.875
Then I had a dream.

01:31:04.945 --> 01:31:07.004
I remember you
telling me about it.

01:31:07.081 --> 01:31:09.549
It was a very
strange dream...

01:31:09.616 --> 01:31:13.211
the first of many dreams.

01:31:13.287 --> 01:31:15.881
Now, then, off with your dress.

01:31:15.956 --> 01:31:18.891
No. I'll rest in the big chair.

01:31:18.959 --> 01:31:20.893
Whatever you say, ma'am.

01:31:20.961 --> 01:31:22.394
Go on down, Rummy.

01:31:27.301 --> 01:31:28.734
Thank you, Martha.

01:31:28.802 --> 01:31:30.895
I'll call you in an hour.

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:37.743
[Door Closes]

01:31:41.148 --> 01:31:44.083
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

01:31:44.151 --> 01:31:46.585
[Ding-Ding Ding-Ding]

01:33:26.954 --> 01:33:27.886
Mummy!

01:33:27.955 --> 01:33:30.048
Hello, Anna!

01:33:39.299 --> 01:33:41.733
Anna! Darling!
This is a surprise.

01:33:41.802 --> 01:33:44.066
How did you get off
from the university?

01:33:44.137 --> 01:33:45.570
They don't know I'm away.

01:33:45.639 --> 01:33:46.571
But--

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.403
Come on, Bill.
Don't be shy.

01:33:48.475 --> 01:33:49.407
This is Bill, Mummy.

01:33:49.476 --> 01:33:50.408
How do you do?

01:33:50.477 --> 01:33:51.671
How do you do?

01:33:51.745 --> 01:33:53.406
His real name is Sir Evelyn
Anthony Peregrine Scathe...

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.004
so of course
he's called Billy...

01:33:55.082 --> 01:33:57.482
and we're thinking
of getting engaged.

01:33:57.551 --> 01:33:58.483
Anna!

01:33:58.552 --> 01:33:59.644
Well, I haven't even
asked her yet...

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.153
but if she keeps on
committing us...

01:34:01.221 --> 01:34:02.586
I suppose I'll have to.

01:34:02.656 --> 01:34:04.590
We've come for
your blessing, Mummy...

01:34:04.658 --> 01:34:06.091
and we haven't had tea.

01:34:06.159 --> 01:34:09.094
Anna, you--you quite take
my breath away.

01:34:11.498 --> 01:34:14.433
Darling, you just make
yourself at home in there...

01:34:14.501 --> 01:34:16.093
and we'll help Martha
with the tea.

01:34:16.169 --> 01:34:18.103
Well, if I'm not wanted.

01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:21.106
Oh, we'll sing out
when we want you.

01:34:21.174 --> 01:34:22.607
Come on, Mummy.

01:34:25.846 --> 01:34:28.610
There will be
two more for tea, Martha.

01:34:28.682 --> 01:34:29.614
Martha!

01:34:29.683 --> 01:34:31.116
Miss Anna.

01:34:31.184 --> 01:34:33.118
And you'll find a strange young man
in the living room.

01:34:33.186 --> 01:34:34.118
Who?

01:34:34.187 --> 01:34:36.121
Well, what do you think?

01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:38.783
Gracious. You haven't
given me time to think.

01:34:38.859 --> 01:34:41.020
I gather his name
is Sir Evelyn Scathe...

01:34:41.094 --> 01:34:42.618
and you want to marry him.

01:34:42.696 --> 01:34:44.129
Sir Evelyn?

01:34:44.197 --> 01:34:45.789
I met him at a dance
in London.

01:34:45.866 --> 01:34:47.128
He's a sublieutenant
in the navy.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.134
You know my weakness
for sailormen.

01:34:49.202 --> 01:34:50.794
Well, it's the first
I've heard of it.

01:34:50.871 --> 01:34:52.805
Oh, it's a lifelong vice.

01:34:52.873 --> 01:34:54.636
But what do you
want me to say?

01:34:54.708 --> 01:34:56.141
Don't matter what you say.

01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:58.143
She'll have her own way,
same as her mother.

01:34:58.211 --> 01:35:00.145
Don't you go making eyes
at him, now.

01:35:00.213 --> 01:35:03.080
Only a lieutenant?
Captains is more in my line.

01:35:03.150 --> 01:35:04.344
[Giggles]

01:35:04.418 --> 01:35:07.581
Oh, I've never been
so happy in all my life.

01:35:07.654 --> 01:35:09.087
Then I'm happy, too...

01:35:09.156 --> 01:35:11.590
and I shan't waste time
with questions.

01:35:11.658 --> 01:35:13.592
I knew you wouldn't,
and wait till you hear.

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:15.093
I've discussed it with Bill.

01:35:15.162 --> 01:35:17.596
You're to come and live with us,
you and Martha.

01:35:17.664 --> 01:35:19.097
Oh, no, darling.

01:35:19.166 --> 01:35:20.599
Oh, but you must.

01:35:20.667 --> 01:35:23.602
You've been alone
so much of your life.

01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:27.106
You're very kind,
but... it's hard to explain.

01:35:27.174 --> 01:35:30.610
You can be much more alone
with other people

01:35:30.677 --> 01:35:32.611
than you are by yourself...

01:35:32.679 --> 01:35:34.943
even it's people you love.

01:35:35.015 --> 01:35:38.382
That sounds all mixed-up,
doesn't it?

01:35:38.452 --> 01:35:42.582
No, not a bit, but if you ever
change your mind...

01:35:42.656 --> 01:35:44.715
Get a plate, darling.

01:35:46.626 --> 01:35:48.560
And some extra cups.

01:35:48.628 --> 01:35:51.563
No. I--I won't
change my mind.

01:35:51.631 --> 01:35:55.567
I love this house,
and I've been very happy here...

01:35:55.635 --> 01:35:57.728
and I shall live here till I die.

01:35:57.804 --> 01:35:59.237
With Captain Gregg?

01:36:00.307 --> 01:36:01.740
What did you say?

01:36:01.808 --> 01:36:04.174
With the ghost
of Captain Gregg?

01:36:04.244 --> 01:36:06.678
Anna, what are you
talking about?

01:36:06.747 --> 01:36:08.180
Oh, I knew the captain
very well.

01:36:08.248 --> 01:36:09.681
When I was a little girl...

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:11.183
the first year we lived here...

01:36:11.251 --> 01:36:13.185
we used to have
the most wonderful talks.

01:36:13.253 --> 01:36:14.686
You didn't.

01:36:14.755 --> 01:36:16.848
It was all a game
I made up, of course...

01:36:16.923 --> 01:36:18.857
sort of a dream game...

01:36:18.925 --> 01:36:22.361
but it was a very real
while it lasted...

01:36:22.429 --> 01:36:24.363
and he stopped
coming suddenly.

01:36:24.431 --> 01:36:28.868
I suppose I was growing too old
and sophisticated for him...

01:36:28.935 --> 01:36:30.698
but I grieved and grieved.

01:36:30.771 --> 01:36:33.706
I was hopelessly
in love with him.

01:36:33.774 --> 01:36:36.709
Heavens. You look
as if you've seen a...

01:36:36.777 --> 01:36:39.712
Don't tell me
you saw him, too.

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.509
No.

01:36:41.581 --> 01:36:44.379
No, not for years.

01:36:44.451 --> 01:36:45.850
Then you did.

01:36:45.919 --> 01:36:49.355
Oh, Mummy, you don't suppose
he really haunted us.

01:36:49.423 --> 01:36:52.517
No, darling.
Things like that can't happen.

01:36:52.592 --> 01:36:55.356
It was only a dream.

01:36:55.429 --> 01:36:58.865
The same dream for both of us?

01:36:58.932 --> 01:37:02.197
Perhaps I set you off
by telling you about my dreams.

01:37:02.269 --> 01:37:04.134
Little girls are
very impressionable.

01:37:04.204 --> 01:37:06.138
I don't remember
your telling me.

01:37:06.206 --> 01:37:09.642
Oh, tell me now.
I'd love to hear about them.

01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:12.143
Well, I can't remember them
very well...

01:37:12.212 --> 01:37:13.645
just bits and pieces...

01:37:13.713 --> 01:37:16.147
a phrase here and there,
a look...

01:37:16.216 --> 01:37:20.778
and I think I dreamed most of my book
Blood and Swash.

01:37:20.854 --> 01:37:22.481
I must have.

01:37:22.556 --> 01:37:25.821
I never could have
thought of it.

01:37:25.892 --> 01:37:30.659
All these years,
I--I've tried to remember...

01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:32.789
but I can't.

01:37:32.866 --> 01:37:34.663
Do you know
what I think?

01:37:34.734 --> 01:37:37.430
I think you
fell in love with him, too.

01:37:37.504 --> 01:37:39.165
I did nothing
of the sort.

01:37:39.239 --> 01:37:42.174
Oh, I wouldn't blame you
if you had.

01:37:42.242 --> 01:37:44.676
When did you
stop seeing him?

01:37:44.744 --> 01:37:48.180
After about a year,
I dreamed we quarreled...

01:37:48.248 --> 01:37:50.842
and it was about a man.

01:37:50.917 --> 01:37:52.350
Uncle Neddy.

01:37:52.419 --> 01:37:55.183
Anna, did you know
that Miles and I--

01:37:55.255 --> 01:37:57.689
I used to pray
you wouldn't marry him.

01:37:57.757 --> 01:37:59.190
And you were so right.

01:37:59.259 --> 01:38:03.127
I saw him about five years ago
at a dinner party.

01:38:03.196 --> 01:38:07.462
He was bald and fat.
He drank too much, and then he cried.

01:38:07.534 --> 01:38:11.800
It seems his wife finally had enough
and took the children away.

01:38:11.872 --> 01:38:14.466
You never can tell, can you?

01:38:14.541 --> 01:38:16.975
Once I thought I wanted

01:38:17.043 --> 01:38:20.672
to spend the rest
of my life with him.

01:38:20.747 --> 01:38:24.808
Oh, perhaps he did exist,
the captain.

01:38:24.885 --> 01:38:27.945
Perhaps he did come back
and talk to us.

01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:30.489
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he had?

01:38:30.557 --> 01:38:32.991
Then you'd have something--
you know what I mean--

01:38:33.059 --> 01:38:35.493
to look back on
with happiness.

01:38:35.562 --> 01:38:37.496
No, darling.
He never existed.

01:38:37.564 --> 01:38:40.499
We made him up,
you and I.

01:38:40.567 --> 01:38:44.162
I just wasn't intended to have
that kind of happiness...

01:38:44.237 --> 01:38:47.172
and I haven't missed it,
really I haven't.

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.674
Oh, I've been lonely
at times...

01:38:49.743 --> 01:38:51.938
but there have been
compensations--you...

01:38:52.012 --> 01:38:55.846
now Bill...
and dear Martha.

01:38:55.916 --> 01:38:59.511
We sit and chatter
like a pair of parrots.

01:39:02.422 --> 01:39:05.448
And this house...

01:39:05.525 --> 01:39:08.460
and the sea
and the gulls...

01:39:10.196 --> 01:39:12.130
and memories...

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.634
I have those, you know.

01:39:15.702 --> 01:39:17.636
Even if it was a dream.

01:39:17.704 --> 01:39:19.137
Now, come along...

01:39:19.205 --> 01:39:22.641
and we'll join your young man
for some tea.

01:40:55.367 --> 01:40:57.631
You, come in here.

01:41:00.706 --> 01:41:02.970
Catch your death.

01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:07.076
What were you
doing out there?

01:41:07.146 --> 01:41:08.579
I don't know.

01:41:08.647 --> 01:41:11.081
You know what
the doctor said.

01:41:11.150 --> 01:41:13.243
Oh, bother the doctor.

01:41:13.319 --> 01:41:14.752
He's an old woman.

01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:18.256
Yeah, and you ain't
a young one anymore.

01:41:18.324 --> 01:41:20.258
Here's a letter from Anna.

01:41:20.326 --> 01:41:21.759
What she say?

01:41:21.827 --> 01:41:23.260
Little Lucy's engaged

01:41:23.329 --> 01:41:26.765
to the captain
of a transatlantic plane.

01:41:26.832 --> 01:41:28.766
Anna's very happy
about it.

01:41:28.834 --> 01:41:31.769
Says it must
run in the family.

01:41:31.837 --> 01:41:34.772
Airplanes, not in my family,
they don't.

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.774
I suppose she means captains.

01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:41.445
Here, drink your hot milk.

01:41:41.513 --> 01:41:43.947
Not now, Martha.
I'm too tired...

01:41:44.016 --> 01:41:47.452
and I have a funny pain
in my arm.

01:41:47.519 --> 01:41:49.783
No wonder,
standing out there in the fog.

01:41:49.855 --> 01:41:51.789
Come on, drink it up.

01:41:51.857 --> 01:41:53.290
Stop bossing me, Martha.

01:41:53.359 --> 01:41:55.293
I don't want
any hot milk.

01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:57.295
Now, now.
Don't get in a state.

01:41:57.363 --> 01:42:02.300
I'm not in a state.
I--I just want to be left alone.

01:42:02.368 --> 01:42:03.801
Bossing me.

01:42:03.869 --> 01:42:07.236
Very well. The bossing
I never intended.

01:42:07.306 --> 01:42:11.504
I only brought the milk
for your own good.

01:42:13.879 --> 01:42:15.369
Bossing me.

01:42:23.322 --> 01:42:25.415
I'm tired.

01:42:46.345 --> 01:42:47.277
[Crash]

01:42:53.852 --> 01:42:57.185
And now you'll never
be tired again.

01:42:57.256 --> 01:43:00.783
Come, Lucia.

01:43:00.859 --> 01:43:04.625
Come, my dear.

01:43:47.272 --> 01:43:48.762
Martha...
