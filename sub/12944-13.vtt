that would possibly require me
to know anything about Bolivia.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.667
Ambassador to Bolivia?

10:21.533 --> 10:22.533
Oh.

10:23.367 --> 10:25.100
Whoa. Aren't those those planes

10:25.166 --> 10:26.667
that your aunt
gave you for your birthday?

10:26.900 --> 10:28.400
I thought you thought they were goofy.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.533
That's what I thought.
They're actually kind of cool.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.900
The Allies used this plane
in World War II

10:32.967 --> 10:35.367
to deliver powdered eggs
and rubber to American Samoa.

10:36.133 --> 10:38.500
Wow, that's so cool.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.300

10:40.500 --> 10:43.333
Anyway, everyone's really excited
about this whole <i>Rat Pack</i> dance.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.500
Ugh.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.734
Oh, come on.
I know you don't like dancing,

10:46.800 --> 10:47.867
but it could still be fun.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.600
It's not the dancing. I'm just not
into that <i>Rat Pack</i> thing anymore.

10:52.066 --> 10:53.066
Not into it?

10:53.367 --> 10:54.367
That's nuts.

Oh, come on, you love it.

10:56.533 --> 10:57.533
Not anymore.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.000
Now I love radio-controlled

11:03.467 --> 11:04.533
How could you just give that up?

11:04.867 --> 11:05.934
Fine, I'll tell you why.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.367
It's because you and Miranda
got Ethan Craft into it,

11:08.433 --> 11:10.266
and then he got
everybody else into it.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.767
When Kate Sanders
likes something,

11:11.834 --> 11:13.266
it's officially a mindless fad,

11:13.333 --> 11:14.600
and I don't want any part of it.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.133
[SCOFFS] Gordo, I think
Kate might really like it.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.667
She thinks it's ding-dong.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.233
The phrase is "Ring-A-Ding-Ding".

11:20.300 --> 11:22.367
It was a code for living life
on your own terms.

11:22.734 --> 11:25.266
A ding-dong is a chocolate
covered devil's food cake treat

11:25.333 --> 11:26.567
intended for mass consumption.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.300
I'm not into mass consumption.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.033
Let's do homework.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.400
Great. I ruined Gordo's hobby,

11:34.633 --> 11:36.700
and I ate a cat hair cupcake.

will officially be called

12:58.734 --> 12:59.934

13:00.266 --> 13:02.333
I thought it would be really lounge

13:03.233 --> 13:04.300
to have those little plastic

13:04.367 --> 13:06.400

glasses for punch.

Lizzie, since you're the expert,

13:11.333 --> 13:14.166
we are going to need
a list of songs the DJ should play.

13:14.700 --> 13:15.700
No problem.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.500
Any idea what those songs are?

13:18.333 --> 13:22.066
Oh, and we are going
to have a costume contest.

13:22.567 --> 13:25.200
Miranda, we'll need
a list of the kind of outfits

13:25.266 --> 13:26.567

13:26.967 --> 13:27.967
You got it.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.233
You know what those are?

13:30.867 --> 13:35.667
And we are going to need
all of this by tomorrow.

13:41.734 --> 13:44.033
We have to get Gordo to give us
the scoop on this stuff.

13:44.967 --> 13:46.000
We can ask him, but I don't think

13:46.066 --> 13:47.667
he's gonna be
too crazy about helping us.

13:47.734 --> 13:49.900
He has to.
This is the dance committee.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.934
They can do things to us.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.800
Remember, Gordo's not that wild

13:56.867 --> 13:58.066
about this whole <i>Rat Pack</i> dance,

13:58.133 --> 14:00.166
so let me get around to it
kind of slow, okay?

14:01.734 --> 14:04.200
This is like,
the dorkiest hobby ever.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.000
Hey, Gordo.
How's the plane stuff coming along?

14:07.233 --> 14:08.233
It looks really cool.

14:08.433 --> 14:09.834
Can't get the engine started.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.667
Oh, well, uh, you will.

14:13.266 --> 14:14.633
So how fast do these things fly?

14:14.967 --> 14:16.900
If anyone ever gets one
off the ground, I'll tell you.

[SCOFFS] We need a list

-and the Rat Pack's favorite food.
-Huh?

14:24.867 --> 14:26.800
What can I say? I cut to the chase.

14:28.066 --> 14:30.100
The Sinatra songs were
all called Leave me Alone,

14:30.300 --> 14:32.066

was goodbye.

Gordo, come on.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.200
Come on what? You guys are
the big <i>Rat Pack</i> fans here.

14:37.266 --> 14:38.500
You should know all this stuff.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.333
You're the <i>Rat Pack</i> fan
and you know it.

Not anymore, not since
you guys made it a big fad.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.734
Now I'm stuck
with this lame old hobby.

14:49.800 --> 14:50.800
You're not stuck with it,

14:50.867 --> 14:52.600
and you don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

14:52.667 --> 14:53.667
But it's not our fault that

14:53.734 --> 14:55.266
the other kids like the music and stuff.

We can't help it if you
refuse to like something

15:02.867 --> 15:04.467
just because other people like it.

15:04.533 --> 15:05.867
It's called being your own person.

15:05.934 --> 15:07.767
It's called being an idiot, okay?

15:08.066 --> 15:10.367
It's ridiculous to do some
airplane thing that you hate

15:10.433 --> 15:12.567
instead of doing some
<i>Rat Pack</i> thing that you love.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.500
Besides, why isn't anyone else
allowed to like Frank Sinatra?

15:16.934 --> 15:18.233
Because they don't
even really like him.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.900
They're just mindless trendoids
following the herd.
