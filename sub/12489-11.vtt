IT'S GOOD THAT
HE KEEPS GOING.

01:09.140 --> 01:12.743

THEY WENT TO A DUDE RANCH?!

02:53.274 --> 02:55.906
DUDE, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO GO UP TO A COW

02:55.906 --> 02:57.808
AND CALL IT
A "BIG-BONED HEIFFA."

02:57.808 --> 03:00.381
MAYBE TELL IT
TO "MOOOVE OVER."

03:00.381 --> 03:01.752

I told you there
was someone down there.

What do we do?

04:30.301 --> 04:31.902

GONNA HIT HIM WITH A COPY
OF A BOOK YOU WROTE?

NO, I WAS GONNA
SIGN IT FOR HIM.

I MAKE THIS OUT TO?!

OH, IT'S JUST
THE COMPUTER.

04:56.527 --> 04:58.969
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
ONE OF THE KIDS
MUST'VE LEFT IT ON.

04:58.969 --> 05:01.832
IT'S ONE OF THOSE STUPID,
MINDLESS VIDEOS.

05:01.832 --> 05:04.435

05:15.346 --> 05:17.317
STAN, YOU HAVE
TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.589
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

05:18.589 --> 05:21.992
YEAH, "DOG WITH THE HOSE"
IS LIKE TWO YEARS OLD.

05:21.992 --> 05:25.526
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE VIDEOS
WE WATCHED AT THE DUDE RANCH.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.997
STOP WITH THE DUDE RANCH!

05:26.997 --> 05:28.959
NOT EVERYBODY GOT TO GO!

HOWDY.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.473
KIDS, YOUR MOM AND I

TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

05:42.473 --> 05:44.715
WE HEARD A NOISE
LAST NIGHT.

05:44.715 --> 05:46.747
AND WE THOUGHT
IT WAS A BURGLAR.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.949
OH, NO!
THAT'S TERRIBLE!

05:48.949 --> 05:50.881
GOOD THING IT WAS JUST
THE COMPUTER.

05:50.881 --> 05:51.882
WHAT?

05:51.882 --> 05:54.525
WHAT?

05:54.525 --> 05:55.986
ANYWAY, IT
GOT US THINKING,

05:55.986 --> 05:58.859
"WOULD WE BE PREPARED
IF THERE REALLY WERE
AN UNWANTED VISITOR?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.891

06:00.891 --> 06:03.564
NO.
All: OH, THANK GOODNESS.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.897
ANYWAY, WE JUST NEED
A PLAN IN CASE THERE'S
EVER A REAL INTRUDER.

06:06.897 --> 06:08.839
I WAS ACTUALLY
THINKING, HON,

06:08.839 --> 06:11.402
MAYBE WE COULD GET
A HIGH-TECH SECURITY SYSTEM.

06:11.402 --> 06:13.704
NO...
UH--I FOUND THIS
REAL BEAUT ONLINE.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.546
THE HOME WATCHER 9000.

06:15.546 --> 06:17.708
WE CAN GET THE WHOLE HOUSE
WIRED WITH SENSORS

06:17.708 --> 06:19.810
AND MONITORS, AND THEY
HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'LL MAKE--

06:19.810 --> 06:21.381
NO, NO, NO.
THAT SOUNDS WAY TOO MUCH

06:21.381 --> 06:23.754
LIKE THAT "HOUSE WIZARD"
APP YOU PUT ON OUR PHONES.

06:23.754 --> 06:25.856
LIGHTS.

06:25.856 --> 06:27.087
LIGHTS.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.659
LIGHTS!

06:30.821 --> 06:32.593
( beeping )
SIMPLE.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.995

AAH!

( Bennett and Ellen
yelling )

06:39.069 --> 06:40.901
( screaming )

06:42.833 --> 06:45.536
NO COMPLICATED,
HIGH-TECH SECURITY SYSTEM.

06:45.536 --> 06:49.079
YOU KNOW, THE BEST DETERRENT
TO CRIMINALS IS A DOG.

06:49.079 --> 06:50.941
AND THIS WOULD BE
SO GOOD FOR STAN.

06:50.941 --> 06:52.713
YOU KNOW,
DOGS NEED A PURPOSE.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.084
WORKING DOGS ARE HEALTHIER,

06:54.084 --> 06:56.116
HAPPIER, AND THEY
LIVE LONGER.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.488
I DON'T KNOW, SWEETIE.

06:57.488 --> 06:59.590
STAN'S NOT REALLY
A GUARD DOG.

06:59.590 --> 07:00.691
BUT WE CAN TRAIN HIM.

07:00.691 --> 07:02.122
YOU KNOW, HE'S A REALLY
QUICK LEARNER.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.954
LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS
I'VE ALREADY TAUGHT HIM.

07:03.954 --> 07:06.126
STAN, SIT.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.998
GOOD BOY. SPEAK.

07:07.998 --> 07:08.999
( barks )

07:08.999 --> 07:10.200
GOOD BOY. SHAKE.

07:17.107 --> 07:19.039
WOW, CAN YOU
TEACH ME THAT?

07:19.039 --> 07:21.171
I DON'T THINK SO.
ALL RIGHT.

07:21.171 --> 07:23.574
WELL, I GUESS STAN
MIGHT BE A BETTER OPTION

07:23.574 --> 07:26.647
THAN SOME SECURITY SYSTEM
I WON'T BE ABLE TO OPERATE.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.119
SOUNDS LIKE A "YES" TO ME.
( chuckles )

07:29.119 --> 07:31.522
YES! THAT COULD
BE MY PURPOSE.

07:31.522 --> 07:32.923
GUARD DOG.

07:32.923 --> 07:35.756
OH, THIS'LL BE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN WHEN I WAS A FOOT MODEL.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.988
Woman: NEXT UP
IS ITEM J35-3,

07:37.988 --> 07:40.060
A LADIES OPEN TOE
SLING BACK PUMP.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.093
( record scratches )
WHY IS THAT DOG STILL HERE?!

07:45.035 --> 07:46.497
THANKS, AVERY!

07:46.497 --> 07:49.099
THIS GUARD DOG GIG
IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

07:49.099 --> 07:51.171
YOU KNOW, I PROMISED THEM
YOU'D BE GOOD AT THIS.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.204
I WENT OUT ON A LIMB FOR YOU,
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO DELIVER.

07:54.204 --> 07:55.776
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN, AVERY.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.508
I'LL BECOME
THE BEST GUARD DOG

07:57.508 --> 07:59.149
THIS HOUSE HAS EVER SEEN.

07:59.149 --> 08:02.513
HOW MANY HAS IT SEEN,
JUST SO I KNOW WHAT
I'M UP AGAINST?

08:04.114 --> 08:06.517
I'VE GOT A LOT
OF TRAINING TO DO.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.519
( workout music playing )

08:21.171 --> 08:22.733
I'M READY.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.543
HEY, HONEY.

08:32.543 --> 08:35.215
BACK FROM CLASS
ALREADY, HUH?

08:35.215 --> 08:36.887
HI.
( screams )

08:38.849 --> 08:42.122
CAN'T SHE KEEP
THAT THING IN HER ROOM?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.654
BENNETT, I AM PUMPED!

08:43.654 --> 08:46.096
AFTER MY COOKING CLASS,
I TOOK A SELF-DEFENSE CLASS.

08:46.096 --> 08:47.928
THAT REALLY WOULD
NOT BE NECESSARY

08:47.928 --> 08:51.161
IF WE GOT THE
HOME WATCHER SYSTEM...
MMM.

08:51.161 --> 08:52.833
AW, LOOK AT THIS, ELLEN.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.165
IT MONITORS MOVEMENT
IN EVERY INCH OF THE HOUSE.

08:55.165 --> 08:56.667
IT CONTACTS THE AUTHORITIES.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.068
IT EVEN HAS A FAIL-SAFE
KILL SWITCH

08:58.068 --> 09:00.040
IN CASE THE SYSTEM
BECOMES SELF-AWARE

09:00.040 --> 09:01.972
AND DECIDES TO DESTROY
HUMANITY.

09:01.972 --> 09:05.115
JUST COME HERE.
LET ME TEACH YOU WHAT
I LEARNED IN SELF-DEFENSE.

09:05.115 --> 09:06.546
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.248
YOU PRETEND TO BE
AN INTRUDER AND COME AT ME.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.720
REALLY?

09:10.721 --> 09:12.783
( yells )
WAIT!

09:12.783 --> 09:14.925
PUT YOUR LEFT HAND
ON MY RIGHT SHOULDER.

09:14.925 --> 09:17.557
FEET APART, LEAVING YOUR
VITAL ORGANS EXPOSED.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.989
WHAT?

09:18.989 --> 09:21.862
OH, WAIT A SECOND.
LET ME JUST...
( groaning )

09:26.897 --> 09:29.569
NOW SURPRISE ME!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.972
WHAT IF THE INTRUDER
DOESN'T WANNA FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS

09:31.972 --> 09:33.974
AND ALLOW YOU
TO WARM UP?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.606
( grunting )

09:36.977 --> 09:39.149
CAN YOUR HOME WATCHER
DO THAT?

09:39.149 --> 09:41.581
( choking )
IF YOU GET THE UPGRADE.

09:45.816 --> 09:48.158
HALT. STATE YOUR BUSINESS.

09:48.158 --> 09:50.621
I'M A KID.
I HAVE NO BUSINESS.

09:50.621 --> 09:52.723
THAT CHECKS OUT.
CARRY ON.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.699
STAN, YOU'RE STILL
STANDING GUARD UP THERE?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.631
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU'VE SLEPT?

10:00.631 --> 10:03.934
HA! I DON'T NEED SLEEP.
SLEEP IS FOR HAND MODELS.

10:03.934 --> 10:05.605
I HAVE A SENSE OF PURPOSE.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.638
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS MISSING.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.980
AW, I'M SO HAPPY
IT'S WORKING OUT FOR YOU.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.813
YOU KNOW, YOU BRING
SO MUCH HAPPINESS
TO EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.185
IT'S NICE THAT YOU'RE
FINALLY GETTING SOME
HAPPINESS BACK.

10:15.185 --> 10:16.687
AW, THANKS.

10:16.687 --> 10:19.049
( yawning )
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU
FOR DOING THIS.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.050
LOVE YOU, STAN.

10:20.050 --> 10:22.152
I LOVE YOU, TOO, AVERY.
( chuckles )

10:22.152 --> 10:24.755
HALT! WHO GOES THERE?!

10:24.755 --> 10:26.256
STAN, IT'S AVERY.

10:26.256 --> 10:28.128
YOU JUST SAID
YOU'D NEVER FORGET ME.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.129
DID I?
( yawns )

10:29.129 --> 10:31.061
I'M A LITTLE BIT TIRED.

10:31.061 --> 10:32.362
I REALLY THINK YOU
SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.

10:32.362 --> 10:35.135
THANKS. YOU'RE REALLY
LOOKIN' OUT FOR ME, AVERY.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.407
HALT! WHO GOES THERE?!

10:37.407 --> 10:39.870
STAN, SERIOUSLY,
GET SOME REST.

10:39.870 --> 10:42.142
I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
FOR DOIN' THIS.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.644
HALT! WHO GOES THERE?!

10:44.644 --> 10:46.777
COME ON, GUYS!
IT'S TIME TO GO
TO THE CARNIVAL!

10:46.777 --> 10:48.178
LET'S GO!

10:48.178 --> 10:50.781
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
GET YOUR COATS!

10:50.781 --> 10:52.683
WHOO, YEAH!

10:52.683 --> 10:56.056
OH, HAS ANYONE
SEEN YOUR MOTHER?

10:56.056 --> 10:58.388
VERY FUNNY. I'M PRACTICING
MY SNEAK-ATTACK.

10:58.388 --> 11:01.361
HOW IS "SNEAK-ATTACK"
A PART OF SELF-DEFENSE?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.193
DO NOT QUESTION
SENSEI DEREK.

11:03.193 --> 11:05.665
OH! WAIT,
GOTTA GET MY JACKET.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.668
WOULD YOU STOP WALKING
SO I CAN THROW YOU
TO THE FLOOR?

11:10.901 --> 11:12.342
WHY ARE YOU RECORDING THAT?

11:12.342 --> 11:14.204
SOMEDAY, WHEN I'M
CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR

11:14.204 --> 11:16.206
IN A FETAL POSITION,
UNABLE TO SPEAK,

11:16.206 --> 11:19.109
SHOW THIS TO MY DOCTORS.
IT WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

11:24.815 --> 11:26.817
( family chattering
excitedly )

11:29.790 --> 11:31.391
THANKS FOR WINNING ME
A FREE MONKEY.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.094
EH, THAT "FREE MONKEY"
COST ME ALMOST A HUNDRED BUCKS

11:34.094 --> 11:35.365
OF RING TOSSES.

11:35.365 --> 11:37.327
I TOLD YOU IT
WAS OKAY TO STOP TRYING.

11:37.327 --> 11:39.229
BUT YOU SAID
NO BABY-TOOTH CARNY

11:39.229 --> 11:40.971
WAS GONNA GET THE BEST
OF YOU.

11:42.332 --> 11:45.906
HEY, GOOD BOY, STAN!

11:45.906 --> 11:48.238
LOOK AT HIM GETTIN'
HIS GUARD DOG ON, HONEY.

11:48.238 --> 11:50.210
SEE, I TOLD YOU
HE COULD DO IT.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.282
AND LOOK HOW MUCH HAPPIER
HE IS TO HAVE A PURPOSE.

11:52.282 --> 11:55.345
I AM HAPPY. SO WHAT
IF I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN THREE DAYS?

11:55.345 --> 11:56.787
IT'S NOT AFFECTING ME.

11:56.787 --> 11:58.248
ANYONE ELSE
SEE THAT LEPRECHAUN

11:58.248 --> 12:00.791
DANCING IN FRONT
OF THE RED CURTAIN?

12:00.791 --> 12:03.193
ALL RIGHT,
UP TO BED, EVERYONE.

12:03.193 --> 12:05.725
CAN'T I JUST GO BACK
TO THE CARNIVAL BY MYSELF?

12:05.725 --> 12:06.927
NO.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.429
I BARELY GOT TO TALK
TO TILT-A-WHIRL GIRL.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.831
IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.263
NOT FOR HER.
SHE DROPPED OUT
A LONG TIME AGO.

12:13.263 --> 12:15.265
UP TO BED.
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.

12:15.265 --> 12:17.037
OKAY, MOM.
DON'T FREAK OUT ON ME

12:17.037 --> 12:18.769
LIKE YOU DID WITH THAT GUY
AT THE CARNIVAL.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.340
HE CAME AT ME
WITH A STICK.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.342
IT WAS A CHURRO!

12:22.342 --> 12:25.846
COULD'VE BEEN
A SUGAR-COATED GUN.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.883
HEY. WHERE YOU GOIN'?

12:32.883 --> 12:36.326
SNEAKIN' OUT
OF THE HOUSE TO TAKE A SPIN
WITH THE TILT-A-WHIRL GIRL.

12:36.326 --> 12:38.488
OKAY THEN. CARRY ON.

12:38.488 --> 12:41.261
STAN, YOU'VE BEEN
UP THERE FOR DAYS.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.894
WHY DON'T YOU
GET OFF THAT COFFEE TABLE
AND GET SOME SLEEP?

12:43.894 --> 12:45.996
YOU WANT ME
ON THIS COFFEE TABLE!

12:45.996 --> 12:48.468
YOU NEED ME
ON THIS COFFEE TABLE!

12:48.468 --> 12:52.242
COME ON, YOU'RE
SO EXHAUSTED YOU'RE
NOT EVEN MAKING ANY SENSE.

12:52.242 --> 12:55.946
REALLY? THREE IS A BLANKET
YOU DO NOT WANT TO SWIM IN.

12:55.946 --> 12:58.108
WHATEVER. GOOD NIGHT, STAN.

12:58.108 --> 12:59.249
GOOD NIGHT, CAROL.

13:03.353 --> 13:05.785
WHOA, WHOA.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.958
THANKS FOR HELPING ME HOME,
BEARDED LADY.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.320
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
GONE ON THAT TILT-A-WHIRL

13:10.320 --> 13:11.491
THOSE LAST TEN TIMES.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.164
I'M SO DIZZY. WHOA.

13:14.164 --> 13:16.026
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR
ONE-MAN--WOMAN SHOW.

13:17.027 --> 13:18.568
WHOA!
( crashing )

13:18.568 --> 13:21.201
SHH. WHOA!

13:21.201 --> 13:22.432
WHOA!

13:22.432 --> 13:24.134
AAH! NO!

13:24.134 --> 13:26.236
( knickknacks rattling )

13:26.236 --> 13:28.839
PUT YOUR LEFT HAND
ON MY RIGHT SHOULDER!
WHAT?

13:28.839 --> 13:30.410
( grunts )
( Tyler yells )

13:30.410 --> 13:32.582
Bennett: HONEY!
BENNETT!

13:32.582 --> 13:35.015
ARE YOU OKAY?!
YES!

13:35.015 --> 13:37.217
OH! YOU GOT HIM!
( laughing )

13:37.217 --> 13:39.189
( both gasping,
panting )

13:39.189 --> 13:41.191
Both: TYLER?

13:41.191 --> 13:43.223
( weakly )
WHY?

13:51.031 --> 13:54.104
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SNEAKED
OUT OF THE HOUSE LIKE THAT.

13:54.104 --> 13:56.967
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
FOR A MONTH!
COME ON, DAD.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.239
DIDN'T YOU EVER DO SOMETHING
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO DO

13:59.239 --> 14:00.971
FOR THE LOVE
OF A CARNY GIRL?

14:00.971 --> 14:03.273
( scoffs )
NO.

14:03.273 --> 14:04.274
SHH...

14:05.475 --> 14:08.348
COME ON, HASN'T TYLER
BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.080
OH WOW, THANKS, AVERY.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.223
I MEAN, NOT ONLY THE PAIN
OF BEING THROWN TO THE FLOOR,

14:13.223 --> 14:16.486
BUT THE HUMILIATION OF BEING
FOLDED UP LIKE A LAWN CHAIR
BY HIS OWN MOMMY.

14:18.228 --> 14:21.231
AS I FEARED, STAN
IS COMPLETELY USELESS
AS A GUARD DOG.

14:21.231 --> 14:25.065
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE
YOU'RE THE ANSWER, EITHER,

14:25.065 --> 14:27.267
MY LITTLE NINJA FLOWER.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.239
WE CLEARLY NEED

14:29.239 --> 14:33.043
THE HOME WATCHER 9000.

14:33.043 --> 14:34.404
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

14:34.404 --> 14:36.606
AH, JUST SOMETHIN'
THEY SEND YA IF YA
FILL OUT A SURVEY.

14:36.606 --> 14:38.178
CHECK THIS OUT.
( shrill beeping )

14:38.178 --> 14:39.309
Bennett: OH! OH!

14:40.550 --> 14:42.112
THAT'S LOUD!

14:42.112 --> 14:44.284
HOW DO YOU--
HOW DO YOU TURN THIS OFF?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.216
IT'S, UM--( stammers )
NIPPLE, NIPPLE, BELLYBUTTON.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.218
( beeping stops )
( mutters )

14:48.218 --> 14:50.660
THAT WHOLE SECURITY SYSTEM
THING JUST SCARES ME.

14:50.660 --> 14:53.223
OH COME ON, ELLEN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD HAPPEN?

14:53.223 --> 14:56.026
IT COULD FALL IN LOVE
WITH ME.

14:56.026 --> 14:57.527
IS THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

14:59.029 --> 15:00.900
( lock engages )

15:00.900 --> 15:02.933
HOME WATCHER,
OPEN THE BACK DOOR.

15:02.933 --> 15:06.036
Home Watcher:
( imitating HAL 9000 )
I'M SORRY, ELLEN.

15:06.036 --> 15:07.507
I CAN'T DO THAT.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.140
( lock engages )

15:10.140 --> 15:12.312
( Home Watcher cackling )

15:12.312 --> 15:13.283
( lock engages )

15:13.283 --> 15:14.544
BENNETT!

15:14.544 --> 15:16.346
WHAT DO YOU
WANT BENNETT FOR?

15:16.346 --> 15:18.318
AREN'T I ENOUGH FOR YOU,

15:18.318 --> 15:19.589
MY LITTLE NINJA FLOWER?

15:19.589 --> 15:23.153
BENNETT!

15:23.153 --> 15:26.296
ELLEN, I ASSURE YOU
THE HOME WATCHER
IS PERFECTLY SAFE.

15:26.296 --> 15:29.299
IT EVEN HAS CAMERAS
THAT MONITOR EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ON IN THE HOUSE.

15:29.299 --> 15:31.131
WELL, IT WOULD MEAN THE KIDS

15:31.131 --> 15:33.933
WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET AWAY
WITH ANYTHING EVER AGAIN.
YEAH.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.037
Both: WE'LL NEVER GET AWAY
WITH ANYTHING EVER AGAIN!

15:37.037 --> 15:40.270
WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO KEEP THE SECRET
THAT STAN CAN TALK.

15:40.270 --> 15:41.972
STAN, YOU'D BETTER WAKE UP.

15:41.972 --> 15:43.543
I'VE BEEN AWAKE
FOR A WHILE.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.675
I WAS JUST TOO EMBARRASSED
TO FACE YOU ALL.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.177
STAN, YOU WERE SNORING.

15:47.177 --> 15:49.179
I DON'T REALLY
SNORE LIKE THAT.

15:49.179 --> 15:51.181
I SNORE LIKE THIS.
( snores )

15:51.181 --> 15:53.223
MI-MI-MI-MI-MI-MI.

15:53.223 --> 15:54.224
I MEAN, I'M GUESSING.

15:54.224 --> 15:57.187
I'M USUALLY ASLEEP
WHEN IT HAPPENS.

15:57.187 --> 15:59.329
( sighs )
I'M SORRY I LET YOU DOWN.

15:59.329 --> 16:01.691
STAN, YOU DIDN'T
LET ME DOWN.

16:01.691 --> 16:03.233
YOU DID YOUR BEST.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.694
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY,
YOU HEAR ME?

16:04.694 --> 16:06.236
A GOOD BOY.

16:06.236 --> 16:08.968
AND WHEN YOU SNORE
YOU SOUND MORE LIKE THIS:

16:08.968 --> 16:12.242
( sputtering loudly )

16:12.242 --> 16:13.203
THAT'S NOT MY SNORE.

16:13.203 --> 16:15.445
THAT'S MY BEEFIN'.

16:15.445 --> 16:18.448
HEY, MOM AND DAD
ARE HAVING THIS
WHOLE HOUSE MONITORED.

16:18.448 --> 16:20.450
BUT SURE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT SNORING.

16:20.450 --> 16:22.382
OKAY. TYLER
SNORES LIKE THIS:

16:22.382 --> 16:26.156
( hacking )

16:26.156 --> 16:28.288
THAT'S ACTUALLY MY MOM.

16:28.288 --> 16:32.292
BUT TYLER'S RIGHT.
WE CANNOT LET THEM
GET THIS SECURITY SYSTEM.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.363
WE NEED A PLAN.

16:33.363 --> 16:35.665
DON'T INVOLVE ME.
I'M USELESS,

16:35.665 --> 16:37.267
JUST LIKE YOUR MOM SAID.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.229
BUT WHAT DID I SAY?

16:39.229 --> 16:42.402
I'M A GOOD BOY!

16:42.402 --> 16:45.004
( sweetly )
YOU'RE THE BEST BOY.

16:46.376 --> 16:48.378
( loud snoring )

16:48.378 --> 16:50.540
Bennett: ELLEN,
TURN ON YOUR SIDE.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.446
IF WE CAN'T PROVE
STAN'S A GOOD GUARD DOG,

16:56.446 --> 16:58.388
THEY'RE GONNA
GET THAT SECURITY SYSTEM.

16:58.388 --> 16:59.319
THIS PLAN WILL WORK.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.092
WE'VE BEEN PREPARING
FOR IT ALL DAY.

17:02.092 --> 17:05.295
I'M GONNA NEED A "GO,"
"NO-GO" FROM ALL DEPARTMENTS.

17:05.295 --> 17:06.396
SPEAKERS OUTSIDE?

17:06.396 --> 17:07.397
GO.

17:07.397 --> 17:09.028
SOUND EFFECTS?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.361
( tires squealing )

17:11.361 --> 17:12.362
GO.

17:12.362 --> 17:13.363
CARNIVAL MONKEY?

17:13.363 --> 17:15.265
GO.

17:15.265 --> 17:16.736
MANNEQUIN?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.369
( high-pitched )
GO.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.343
ALL RIGHT, STAN.
YOU READY?
I WAS BORN READY.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.446
ACTUALLY, WHEN I WAS BORN,
I COULDN'T SEE,
AND I COULDN'T WALK.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.348
AND MY PAWS WERE WAY
TOO BIG FOR MY BODY.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.520
BUT I'M READY NOW!

17:30.520 --> 17:32.522
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO THIS!

17:32.522 --> 17:33.753
Tyler and Stan: YEAH!

17:33.753 --> 17:36.186
Avery: OPERATION
STANDING GUARD

17:36.186 --> 17:37.487
WILL COMMENCE IN THREE...

17:37.487 --> 17:40.460
TWO...ONE...

17:40.460 --> 17:43.793
MOM! DAD! I-- I THINK
THERE'S SOMEONE OUTSIDE!

17:43.793 --> 17:46.196
( clicks )
( rattling )

17:47.567 --> 17:50.340
HE'S RIGHT. I THINK
THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE.
SHH.

17:51.341 --> 17:52.442
( clicks )
( rattling )

17:52.442 --> 17:53.673
Avery: THE PATIO!

17:55.475 --> 17:56.476
GO, MONKEY!

17:57.307 --> 18:00.210
( grunting )

18:00.210 --> 18:02.582
LOOK! THERE'S SOMEONE
OVER THERE!

18:02.582 --> 18:05.385
SOMETHING'S ABOUT TO GET
ASKED TO PUT THEIR LEFT HAND
ON MY RIGHT SHOULDER.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.687
( barks )

18:07.687 --> 18:09.119
LET STAN TRY!

18:09.119 --> 18:10.520
GO GET 'EM, STAN!

18:10.520 --> 18:12.522
( barking )

18:13.523 --> 18:16.496
( mouthing words )

18:16.496 --> 18:19.269
I SAW SOMEONE OUT THERE.
WHERE'D HE GO?
WELL, WHERE'S STAN?

18:19.269 --> 18:20.500
I DON'T KNOW!
THE WINDOW!

18:20.500 --> 18:21.671
( knocking on glass )

18:23.173 --> 18:24.504
STAN, GET IT. GET IT.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.736
( growling )

18:26.736 --> 18:29.339
OKAY, THIS IS GETTING SERIOUS.
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

18:29.339 --> 18:31.311
WHERE IS MY PHONE?!
I LEFT IT RIGHT HERE!

18:31.311 --> 18:32.642
I-I CAN'T FIND MINE,
EITHER!

18:32.642 --> 18:35.385
( stammering )
I THINK I SAW THEM
IN THE KITCHEN!

18:40.290 --> 18:42.121
LET'S GO!

18:42.121 --> 18:44.524
AVERY!
WHAT ABOUT THE PHONES?

18:44.524 --> 18:45.395
( sighs )

18:45.395 --> 18:47.627
( clattering )

18:47.627 --> 18:49.529
I CAN'T FIND MY PHONE!

18:49.529 --> 18:51.861
LOOK!

18:51.861 --> 18:53.633
( growling )

18:54.764 --> 18:56.666
Stan: GET OFF ME,
YOU CRAZY MUTT!

18:56.666 --> 18:57.907
LET ME GO!

18:57.907 --> 19:00.210
THIS DOG IS TOO VICIOUS!

19:00.210 --> 19:02.772
YET HANDSOME AND MAJESTIC.

19:03.773 --> 19:05.615
I THINK HE'S LEAVING.

19:05.615 --> 19:07.577
( clicks, tires squealing )
HE'S GETTING IN HIS CAR!

19:11.251 --> 19:12.452
STAN, YOU WERE AWESOME.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.254
AND YOU REALLY
SAVED THE DAY, BOY.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.457
WOW. SO I GUESS WE DON'T
NEED THAT SECURITY SYSTEM.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.559
( talking over each other )
NO...
NO WAY...

19:19.559 --> 19:21.431
AND I GUESS YOU WON'T
HAVE TO TAKE THOSE
SELF-DEFENSE CLASSES.

19:21.431 --> 19:23.363
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
MM-MMM.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.836
AND I GUESS I DON'T
HAVE TO HIDE THAT BARN SNAKE
I TOOK FROM THE DUDE RANCH.

19:26.836 --> 19:28.268
Both: WHAT?

19:28.268 --> 19:29.699
WHAT?

19:33.543 --> 19:35.505
WE DID IT!
WHOO!
GREAT JOB.

19:35.505 --> 19:37.377
WAY TO GO, MANNEQUIN.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.349
WAY TO GO, STAN!
Avery: YEAH.

19:39.349 --> 19:40.350
( knocking on door )

19:40.350 --> 19:41.351
WHOA!

19:41.351 --> 19:42.452
Bennett: CAN I COME IN?

19:42.452 --> 19:43.883
( whimpering )

19:46.216 --> 19:47.357
YEAH! COME ON IN!
YEP.

19:48.358 --> 19:50.320
HI.
Girls: HI.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.593
I KNOW THAT LITTLE SCENE
YOU GUYS DID DOWNSTAIRS
WAS A FAKE.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.595
IT WAS HIS IDEA!
IT WAS HER IDEA!

19:57.327 --> 19:58.798
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.431
ARE WE IN TROUBLE?

20:01.431 --> 20:03.273
WELL...
( clears throat )

20:03.273 --> 20:05.375
I WAS THINKING THIS
COULD BE OUR LITTLE SECRET,

20:05.375 --> 20:06.576
NOT TELL MOM.

20:06.576 --> 20:08.608
AS LONG AS SHE THINKS
STAN CAN PROTECT US,

20:08.608 --> 20:10.480
SHE'LL STAY OUT OF THAT
SELF-DEFENSE CLASS

20:10.480 --> 20:11.711
AND STOP
WITH THE SNEAK-ATTACKS.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.413
HI, GUYS.
( yells )

20:13.413 --> 20:16.616
THERE'S MY...
STEALTHY LADY NOW.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.588
I JUST CAME
TO CONGRATULATE STAN

20:18.588 --> 20:20.420
ON A JOB WELL DONE.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.322
AH! THAT'S WHAT
I WAS DOING.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.625
( humming )

20:25.625 --> 20:27.397
I KNOW YOU KIDS
STAGED THE WHOLE THING.

20:27.397 --> 20:29.459
IT WAS HIS IDEA!
IT WAS HER IDEA!

20:29.459 --> 20:33.433
I'M SO CONFUSED.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.506
FINE. LET'S NOT SAY ANYTHING
TO DAY ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

20:36.506 --> 20:38.408
NOW THAT HE THINKS
STAN'S A GUARD DOG,

20:38.408 --> 20:40.510
HE'S NOT GETTING
THAT STUPID SECURITY SYSTEM.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.472
OUR LITTLE SECRET, OKAY?
( clicks tongue )

20:46.516 --> 20:47.977
( sighs )
THAT WAS CLOSE.

20:47.977 --> 20:49.449
MAN.
WHEW.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.351
WHEW!

20:52.752 --> 20:55.325
Stan: AVERY
NEVER LOST FAITH IN ME,

20:55.325 --> 20:56.826
AND THAT MEANS A LOT.

20:56.826 --> 20:58.488
AND BEING
THE FAMILY WATCHDOG

20:58.488 --> 21:00.490
GIVES ME A REAL
SENSE OF PURPOSE.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.932
I'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING
ON SOME HOBBIES
TO FILL MY TIME.

21:02.932 --> 21:05.535
YOU KNOW WHAT TURNED OUT
TO BE REALLY GREAT?

21:05.535 --> 21:07.997
GOING TO A DUDE RANCH!

21:14.604 --> 21:16.606
HEY, TYLER.

21:16.606 --> 21:18.608
MOM WAS SHOWING ME SOME
OF HER SELF-DEFENSE MOVES,

21:18.608 --> 21:20.610
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TRY ONE OUT ON YOU.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.011
( scoffs )
COME ON.

21:22.011 --> 21:23.853
THERE'S NO WAY
A LITTLE THING LIKE YOU

21:23.853 --> 21:26.716
IS GONNA BE ABLE TO TRY
ANY KIND OF MOVES ON ME.

21:26.716 --> 21:28.588
WHOA!

21:29.589 --> 21:30.920
( weakly )
THAT WAS JUST LUCKY.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.423
( groans )
THERE'S NO WAY YOU
COULD ACTUALLY DO THAT--

21:33.423 --> 21:35.795
( yells )

21:35.795 --> 21:37.527
( laughing )
OH, COOL. CAN I TRY?

21:37.527 --> 21:38.698
YEAH.
NO.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.630
NO.
( grunts )

21:40.630 --> 21:42.301
( yells )

21:42.301 --> 21:44.474
( laughing )
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

21:44.474 --> 21:45.605
( girls laughing )

21:45.605 --> 21:49.509
WHY DOES EVERYONE
KEEP DOING THAT TO ME?

21:49.509 --> 21:51.010
( laughing, muttering )
