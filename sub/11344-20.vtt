(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.104 --> 00:05.573
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.606 --> 00:08.042
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.076 --> 00:10.078
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.111 --> 00:11.312
are members
of an elite squad

00:11.345 --> 00:13.481
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.549
These are their stories.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.087
(Stabler)
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.122
It's been two years
since my last confession.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.257
These are my sins:

00:23.291 --> 00:27.061
I was selfish.
I was disrespectful.

00:27.095 --> 00:31.099
I lost my temper.

00:31.132 --> 00:36.570
For these and all
of my sins I am truly sorry.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.539
After two years
that's it?

00:38.572 --> 00:39.840
Why don't you tell me

00:39.873 --> 00:46.280
what's really
bothering you, Elliot?

00:46.314 --> 00:50.451
It's like I keep losing people.

00:50.484 --> 00:56.090
Like your family?

00:56.124 --> 00:59.360
My family...

00:59.393 --> 01:05.199
my kids...

01:05.233 --> 01:09.237
friends.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.671
You said friends.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.341
You mean someone at work?

01:13.374 --> 01:17.545
[pager beeps]

01:17.578 --> 01:19.413
Sorry, Father, I gotta go.

01:19.447 --> 01:23.751
Okay, but you should
come back.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.853
Ego te absolvo,
in nomine patris,

01:25.886 --> 01:28.556
et filii,
et spiritus sancti.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.823
Amen.

01:29.857 --> 01:37.331
Elliot, for your penance,
call your wife.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.877
(Blaine)
Stabler!

01:49.910 --> 01:51.412
You weren't
at the house.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.714
I thought you
clocked out early.

01:53.747 --> 01:57.385
Lucius Blaine,
Queens SVU.

01:57.418 --> 02:01.389
You and me,
we're gonna be partners.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.424
Victim's a teenage hottie.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.759
No purse, no panties,

02:05.793 --> 02:07.628
unconscious with head trauma,

02:07.661 --> 02:09.630
ligature marks
around both wrists,

02:09.663 --> 02:12.933
and her finger
sliced clean off.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.468
Dump job?

02:14.502 --> 02:16.637
(O'Halloran)
We got fresh tire tracks.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.672
Perp pulled the girl
out of the car.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.674
Dragged her
behind this barricade.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.475
Perps?

02:21.509 --> 02:23.477
We got two clear sets
of footprints.

02:23.511 --> 02:28.916
From the depth of indentation,
these guys aren't small.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.619
Get me an ID
on the tires and the shoes.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.455
Who found her?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.258
Marie Antoinette over there.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.659
Her footprints are
all over the scene too.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.229
Oh, yeah?

02:41.262 --> 02:43.464
You officers
check this woman?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.532
Ma'am, turn around.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.833
Turn around.
What are you doing?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.601
(Blaine)
Where is it?
It's gone!

02:47.635 --> 02:48.602
Here it is right here.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.937
Yeah.
Let it go.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.273
Well, well, well,
what do we have here, huh?

02:52.306 --> 02:54.808
It was on the ground.
I didn't steal it.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.944
So it just jumped up
into your coat?

02:56.977 --> 03:00.214
Hold her.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.616
It looks like our victim's name
is Jessica DeLay.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.219
William Osler High School.

03:05.253 --> 03:10.691
Oh, my God.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.625
What the hell is this?

03:11.659 --> 03:14.995
You cut off her finger,
you freakin' witch?

03:15.028 --> 03:18.332
No, It was just lying
on the ground!

03:18.366 --> 03:20.768
Uh-huh, so taking her money
wasn't enough, was it?

03:20.801 --> 03:21.869
You had
to get this ring?

03:21.902 --> 03:22.970
Huh?
We can still save it--

03:23.003 --> 03:24.505
We can still save it.
Put it on ice.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.939
Answer me!
No!

03:25.973 --> 03:27.608
Hold the bus!
Put it in the cup!

03:27.641 --> 03:29.843
Put it in the cup.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.713
Hold the bus.
I'm coming with you..

03:39.453 --> 03:41.422
[sirens blare]

04:29.737 --> 04:31.672
Jessica's being prepped
for surgery.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.907
Thanks to you, we might be able
to save her finger.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.042
You do a rape kit?

04:35.075 --> 04:35.876
No fluids.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.879
She was sodomized
with a blunt object.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.080
What about the cuts
on her wrists?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.416
Made by a knife,
not by ligatures.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.884
Somebody tried
to cut off her hands?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.686
Couldn't get through the bone,
took a finger instead.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.687
Can I talk to her?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.056
After the surgery.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.791
Excuse me.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.025
Did you call
Jessica's parents?

04:52.059 --> 04:53.627
Mom's on her way.
You question her yet?

04:53.661 --> 04:55.429
No.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.564
There she is.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.065
Hey, I'm a detective,
Jessica.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.066
Leave her alone.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.701
Look, Jessica,
just tell me what happened.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.102
I need to know who did this
to you, okay?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.871
Let me know.
Just tell me something.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.773
Enough!

05:05.806 --> 05:07.841
Look, man, we've got
a window of opportunity.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.443
I understand that,
but scaring the girl's

05:09.477 --> 05:10.444
not gonna get us anything.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.514
Sorry.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.583
I forgot I was dealing
with Detective Sensitive.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.524
Why'd you land
this blowhard on me?

05:23.557 --> 05:26.660
He's a good cop.
Queens SVU speaks highly of him.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.562
Right, that's why
they dumped him on us.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.464
Where's Benson?

05:30.498 --> 05:32.366
Computer crimes.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.503
You needed a break
from each other.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.504
In whose opinion?

05:36.537 --> 05:39.440
Decision's made.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.745
Bring me up to speed.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.046
(Blaine)
Sure thing, Captain.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.949
CSU ID'd the tires
as Bridgestone RX,

05:48.982 --> 05:50.851
used on any number
of SUVs and vans.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.621
Now the shoe prints were made
by a Quattro Game

05:53.654 --> 05:55.122
and a Solon Shock.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.123
Now given the size of the print,

05:56.156 --> 05:59.860
creep number one
is about 5'10", creep two, 5'8".

05:59.893 --> 06:01.895
Where was Jessica attacked?

06:01.929 --> 06:04.832
I wouldn't know.
I wasn't allowed to talk to her.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.468
But she was probably grabbed
anywhere

06:07.501 --> 06:09.169
between her school here

06:09.202 --> 06:11.138
and the downtown
subway station here.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.974
Now for the amount of blood,
CSU reckons

06:14.007 --> 06:17.445
that she was probably raped
and mutilated on the scene.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.713
Until we talk to her,
we won't know.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.982
You got anything
of value you want to add?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.484
Just that it was personal.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.519
Perps didn't take
her money or credit cards.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.687
They just wanted
to inflict pain.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.656
(Blaine)
So why did they steal
her cell phone?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.057
How do you know
she had one?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.892
She's 16
with three credit cards.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.461
She had a cell phone.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.162
(Munch)
Something else
the perps didn't take,

06:35.195 --> 06:37.197
Jessica's Health Department
ID card.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.499
(Cragen)
I never heard
of a teenager working

06:38.532 --> 06:39.500
for the Health Department.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.300
(Munch)
Neither have they.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.503
So what's she doing
with a fake ID?

06:42.536 --> 06:43.604
I don't know, but check out
the number on the back.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.839
It belongs
to Rufus Brownell,

06:45.873 --> 06:47.508
an inspector
at the department.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.408
He's not in the office today.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.711
He's on 14th Street
checking out stores.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.047
His license plate number
is AEV7685.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.153
(Stabler)
That's our boy.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.690
He's got a little friend
in there with him.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.691
What the hell?

07:03.724 --> 07:04.892
Blaine.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.727
Blaine!

07:09.262 --> 07:10.798
Hey-hey-hey-hey!
Take your hands off her!

07:10.831 --> 07:11.999
Get out here!
Get out here!

07:12.032 --> 07:13.200
Ow.
What seems
to be the problem?

07:13.233 --> 07:14.602
Huh?
Huh?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.203
What, One girl
isn't enough for you?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.204
Leave him alone!
Blaine.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.772
It's cool.
I'm a cop, okay?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.574
(Brownell)
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Calm down.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.242
I can explain.
All right,
let's everyone calm down.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.477
Calm down.
Come here.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.712
(Blaine)
Let me see some ID.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.514
Now, what are you doing
with that girl?

07:26.547 --> 07:29.883
I'm a Health Department
Inspector.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.251
I'm working with Lori.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.587
(Blaine)
What, you're working
with her undoing her bra?

07:33.621 --> 07:37.491
I'm fixing her wire.
This is a tobacco sting.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.993
I'm trying to catch stores
selling cigarettes to minors.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.261
You use children
as bait?

07:41.294 --> 07:44.264
Lori's 16.
I pay her eight bucks an hour.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.199
Listen, I'm not
doing anything illegal.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.536
Stabler.
Fake ID come with the job?

07:48.569 --> 07:49.737
What do you mean
it's fake?

07:49.770 --> 07:53.006
Look, it makes
the kids feel important.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.241
Like part of a team.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.277
How about her?
Is she part of the team?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.445
Jessica.
Where did you get this?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.214
From her purse after she was
attacked and nearly killed.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.716
What are you talking about?
What?

08:02.750 --> 08:03.917
You use kids
as bait, man.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.786
You don't think
they might get hurt?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.688
I'm always close by.
Nothing bad happens.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.523
Tell that to Jessica.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.560
We're gonna need a list of
stores that you sent her to.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.565
(Brownell)
These are this month's
investigations.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.166
The blue flags are stores
I raided with Jessica.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.968
I'm surprised she had time
to go to school.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.903
Jessica takes
the job seriously.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.938
It's not
a job, man.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.307
This is putting kids
in harm's way.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.543
More harm than letting
them buy cigarettes?

08:29.577 --> 08:32.279
Where we do these stings,
teen smoking is down by 50%.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.213
I'm helping these kids.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.717
You know, a store loses
its tobacco license,

08:36.750 --> 08:38.586
it's a big hole
in its income.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.621
Any of these places
threaten Jessica?

08:40.654 --> 08:43.857
Sometimes store owners
get angry.

08:43.891 --> 08:47.561
One guy--
one guy did get a bit rough.

08:53.233 --> 08:57.771
That's Jessica.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.573
She pays.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.942
She takes the cigarettes
and heads out.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.978
(Elliot)
It looks like
she's laughing at him.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.148
Yeah, but look.
Nothing happened.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.717
The second there's trouble,
I'm in.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.951
Yeah, that's comforting.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.219
Who's that guy,
and where can we find him?

09:12.252 --> 09:13.654
Hamzid Latif.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.089
Third time
he's been caught this year.

09:16.123 --> 09:20.594
He lost his license
for six months.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.096
The store is two blocks
from where Jessica was found.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.665
I remember
the little bitch.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.233
She cost me
thousands of bucks.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.635
So you took it out on her?

09:27.668 --> 09:28.468
I didn't touch her.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.671
Sure, you did.
We got it on videotape.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.940
Yeah, the health inspector
said you wanted to kill her.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.608
I was angry.
She comes in here.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.610
She says, "I want cigarettes."
I say, "You're too young."

09:36.644 --> 09:38.612
She says, "Come on,
I won't tell anybody."

09:38.646 --> 09:39.713
And she is real pretty.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.615
Yeah.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.084
She is a hottie, all right.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.719
She's all, like, you know,
flirting with me.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.720
What could I do?

09:46.754 --> 09:49.923
Yeah, what could you do?

09:49.957 --> 09:50.758
Pervert.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.160
You get turned on
by little children?

09:53.193 --> 09:54.027
What are you saying?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.996
I'm saying the little whore
came in here

09:56.029 --> 09:57.197
and stole
your tobacco license,

09:57.230 --> 09:58.365
so you wanted
to pay her back.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.668
Okay, she got me angry.
She called me names.
Blaine.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.070
She laugh at me,
but I swear I did not touch her.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.038
That's why you took her outside
and hit her over the head?
Blaine!

10:05.072 --> 10:05.839
What?

10:05.873 --> 10:09.342
Nice shoes.
Are those Quattros?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.044
Tell you what,
why don't we take

10:11.078 --> 10:13.380
Mr. Hamzid for a walk
through the crime scene?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.248
Come on.
Get your jacket.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.786
We need you to print
our friend's shoes here.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.954
No way, you need warrant
for my footprints.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.322
We don't need squat,
smart ass.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.757
Just go stand in the mud.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.025
There's no point.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.727
Hey.
Do it!

10:26.760 --> 10:28.361
I took casts
of the perps' shoes.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.263
Based on the depth
of impressions,

10:30.297 --> 10:33.133
the smaller perp weighed about
240 pounds, the heavier 300.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.169
At most, this guy weighs 150.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.171
Good-bye, Mr. Hamzid.
Thank you for your time.

10:38.205 --> 10:42.242
[cell phone rings]

10:42.275 --> 10:44.377
Stabler.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.682
(Warner)
Where's Olivia?

10:48.716 --> 10:52.385
Reassigned.
Detective Blaine, Dr. Warner.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.121
Your rape-kidnap case.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.924
I ran tests on the blood stains
on your victim's clothes.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.259
There were two blood types.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.794
A perp cut himself?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.195
Cut "herself."

11:02.229 --> 11:03.396
From the levels
of the hormones

11:03.430 --> 11:05.866
FSH and LH
in her blood,

11:05.899 --> 11:08.068
this female's going
through puberty.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.238
We're looking
for a 240-pound girl?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.239
Whose blood glucose
is through the roof.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.441
So when you arrest her,
make sure you tell her

11:14.474 --> 11:16.777
she's got Type Two Diabetes.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.482
(Cragen)
So we're looking for two kids?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.017
Two very large kids.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.185
You speak to Jessica yet?

11:25.218 --> 11:26.086
No, she was sedated post-op.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.088
And then her mom wouldn't
let us see her.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.089
Said she was too upset.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.090
What about
her finger?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.825
They reattached it,
but, you know,

11:31.859 --> 11:33.226
whether she'll be able
to use it again...

11:33.260 --> 11:35.495
(Cragen)
How's Blaine doing?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.398
Great.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.833
Okay, get Jessica to speak.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.402
I'll send Munch and Fin
to her school.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.274
(Jessica)
I don't remember much.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.910
I got out of school
at about 1:30.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.180
And I was gonna take the subway
to Tommy's apartment.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.882
I took my usual shortcut
down an alley.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.850
And then I heard
a van behind me.

11:56.884 --> 11:57.851
It stopped.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.187
And then I heard footsteps.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.289
And then suddenly there was
a bag over my head.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.291
And I was being dragged
into the van.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.260
The next thing I know
I'm here.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.396
How many people were
in the van, Jessica?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.799
I don't know.
More than one.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.302
Did they say anything to you?
To each other?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.304
No.

12:17.337 --> 12:21.074
Do you have any enemies?
Any school feuds?

12:21.108 --> 12:24.311
No, I get along with everyone.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.512
I have a lot of friends.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.980
Is that true?

12:27.014 --> 12:28.949
Why are you asking me?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.417
You're her friend,
aren't you?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.520
Yes.
Jess doesn't have any enemies.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.956
We think your attackers
knew you.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.490
Which means
you probably know them.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.793
Is there any reason why someone
would want to hurt you?

12:39.827 --> 12:41.795
Why are you making me
go through this again?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.063
I already told you I don't know.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.397
Can't you see
you're upsetting her?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.399
We're just trying
to find out who hurt her.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.902
Did you have your cell phone
when you were attacked?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.237
I don't think so.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.839
(Blaine)
We didn't find it
in your purse.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.473
Well, then those bastards
must have stolen it.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.876
Why didn't
they take anything else?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.911
(Jessica)
Why are you being so mean?

12:57.945 --> 13:01.548
Please, just get out
and leave me alone.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.817
In Queens we treat
a victim like a victim.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.385
Then go back
to Queens.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.889
Gentlemen, you get anything
from Jessica?

13:08.922 --> 13:09.722
Not much.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.925
She wasn't given much
of a chance.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.393
What happened?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.896
Stabler intimidated her.
I'm not buying her
"Little Miss Innocent routine."

13:15.929 --> 13:17.898
You saw how she
led on that store owner.

13:17.931 --> 13:18.932
Hey, good for her, man.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.400
She took down
a drug-peddling creep

13:20.433 --> 13:22.535
who had a thing
for schoolgirls.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.271
The guy
was selling cigarettes.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.874
Jessica's school faxed over
her outreach schedule.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.308
Busy little bee.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.610
Plays, concerts,
debating society.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.879
Who was
the last concert?

13:31.912 --> 13:32.880
The most recent was

13:32.913 --> 13:36.016
the Coretta Scott King
high school orchestra.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.350
That's where we start.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.285
Why?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.453
Because whoever attacked her
knew she played.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.455
You wanna screw up a pianist,
you cut off her finger.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.626
(Stabler)
Do you have any big kids
in the orchestra?

13:46.659 --> 13:47.494
Like over 200 pounds?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.629
It used to be
heavy kids played music

13:49.662 --> 13:51.564
just so they wouldn't have
to do P.E.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.599
But we don't have P.E. anymore,

13:52.632 --> 13:54.634
and about a third
of our kids are overweight.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.469
What are you
doing about it?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.239
Made the cafeteria serve
more salads and fruits.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.108
But kids like
burgers and fries.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.877
Got about a half dozen food
restaurants right on this block.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.612
Vending machines are locked
during school hours,

14:05.645 --> 14:08.248
but kids stock up before.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.450
It's not
just about food.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.419
Right, I mean, these kids,
they could exercise.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.453
Play sports.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.654
Where you been, Detective?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.924
We can't afford
sports facilities

14:16.957 --> 14:18.325
or the teachers
to run them.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.560
They're lucky
to have an orchestra.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.562
Why do you wanna talk
to the kids anyway?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.364
We're looking
for a witness.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.398
Blaine.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.936
Excuse me one second.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.004
Munch checked
Jessica's cell phone records.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.406
There was a call made
an hour after she was attacked.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.942
You get the number?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.143
Great.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.178
[instruments tuning up]

14:38.211 --> 14:40.580
(Rivera)
Hi, everyone.
These are police officers.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.950
They've got a few questions.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.352
We're looking for witnesses
to an assault

14:45.385 --> 14:47.955
that happened
Monday afternoon.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.223
A girl was attacked
on the way to the subway,

14:50.257 --> 14:51.925
and she was hurt real bad.

Anyone?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.664

Kenny, no phones in practice.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.666
Sorry.
Hello...

14:59.699 --> 15:01.034
Hey, Kenny.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.003
What's going on?

15:03.036 --> 15:05.038
You tell me.

15:05.072 --> 15:08.675
Where were you
two afternoons ago?

15:08.708 --> 15:09.676
I don't remember.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.711
You don't remember.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.712
Stand up.
Come with us.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.049
Leave my brother alone.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.985
Hey, and what happened
to your face?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.086
Nothing.
Put it down.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.720
You're coming too.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.691
Let's go.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.060
(Cragen)
What's up with him?

15:27.094 --> 15:28.228
Kenny Bixton, 16.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.629
Wearing Quattro Jumps,

15:29.662 --> 15:31.999
same size as the prints
from the scene.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.166
He say anything?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.534
Yeah. "Get me a soda."

15:34.567 --> 15:37.037
He needs to ease up
on the soda.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.438
What about the girl?

15:38.471 --> 15:41.308
It's his sister Mia,
age 14.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.976
Mom's coming on down.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.644
Get the forensics,
get a confession,

15:44.677 --> 15:46.646
and put this to bed.

15:48.215 --> 15:52.019
The victim described you
pretty good, Mia.

15:52.052 --> 15:56.723
As soon as we walked
into the band room,

15:56.756 --> 15:58.691
we knew exactly
who you were.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.759
Where's my brother?

15:59.792 --> 16:00.860
Next door.

16:00.893 --> 16:06.499
He's been telling
Detective Stabler all about it.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.069
You see, this is
what we call truth time.

16:09.102 --> 16:14.007
Tell us the truth,
and it counts in your favor.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.444
It counts a lot.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.678
Is my mother coming?

16:18.711 --> 16:21.614
The thing is, sweetheart,

16:21.648 --> 16:24.751
once your mother shows up,
the lawyers show up.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.554
And then truth time
is over.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.291
And whatever you say has
to be put in the book.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.327
And once it's there,
it's on your record forever.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.664

16:37.697 --> 16:40.100
I just want my mother.

We're trying to find her.

16:41.201 --> 16:48.375
In fact, my colleague
will leave now and call her.

Mia.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.679
This is your chance.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.547
Tell the truth now.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.284
And the fact it's your
first offense, you'll get off.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.453
Really?

17:00.487 --> 17:03.656
You'll get immunity.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.592
Detective, outside now.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.528
Okay?

17:08.561 --> 17:12.132
Detective!
Outside, please!

17:16.203 --> 17:18.505
What seems
to be your problem?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.640
You--questioning a minor
without a parent present.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.774
Oh, give me a break.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.277
Even if you get something
in there, we can't use it.

17:24.311 --> 17:26.213
Look, we can use it
to break the brother!

17:26.246 --> 17:29.149
They did it, man!
Look, they brutalized that girl!

17:29.182 --> 17:30.350
Right, and when
the defense finds out

17:30.383 --> 17:32.119
how you got
the confession, what?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.587
How they gonna find out, huh?
You're gonna back me up!

17:34.621 --> 17:38.258
The words of two detectives
against a kid.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.459
There's no way
I'm doing that.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.694
Don't give me
that holier-than-though crap.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.463
I know how you work.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.132
You know
nothing about me.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.666
No wonder
your partner dumped you.

17:46.699 --> 17:50.137
What'd you
just say to me?

17:50.170 --> 17:52.205
You screwed her, and now
you're trying to screw me.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.874
Get off me!

17:54.907 --> 17:56.876
Hey-hey-hey!
Come on, guys, easy, easy.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.745
Get off me!
Get off me!

17:58.778 --> 18:00.680
That's enough!
Elliot, come on!

18:00.713 --> 18:03.750
Blaine, my office now.

18:03.783 --> 18:07.354
Everybody, back to work.
Fun's over.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.890
What do you got
to say, Elliot?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.526
Either you get rid of him,
or I quit.

18:13.560 --> 18:18.765
You get changed,
and get in my office.

18:35.682 --> 18:40.587
I like that shirt.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.588
What are you doing here?

18:41.621 --> 18:44.557
I heard what happened
between you and Blaine.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.527
What can I tell you?
He's a prick.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.543
Why didn't you tell me?

19:03.576 --> 19:08.248
Elliot, we've been partners
for seven years.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.850
Longer than anybody else here.

19:10.883 --> 19:17.490
We needed a change.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.758
I'm sorry.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.929
I should have
talked to you.

19:22.962 --> 19:27.334
It's just
too complicated.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.344
Thanks for dropping by.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.917
You got anything
to say?

19:44.951 --> 19:45.985
I've already said it.

19:46.018 --> 19:46.986
You're not leaving.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.288
Is Blaine?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.257
He stays,
and so do you.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.325
You're running away
from yourself.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.728
What are you talking about?

19:55.762 --> 19:59.866
You know why
I put Blaine with you?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.668
Because you
started drinking again?

20:01.701 --> 20:04.537
So you know what
you're like to work with.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.873
What does that mean?
I don't lie to kids.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.008
He bends the rules.
You do too.
Not with kids.

20:09.041 --> 20:14.981
You want me to list every time
you've crossed the line?

20:15.014 --> 20:17.016
You're a good cop.

20:17.049 --> 20:21.254
But God knows how Olivia
put up with you for so long.

20:21.288 --> 20:24.757
Oh, well,
Olivia's a saint.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.894
The kids' mom just left.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.330
CSU is on their way over
to search the house.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.332
Get Blaine,
and get over there.
Captain.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.935
You will work this case
together, understood?

21:01.494 --> 21:05.798
Sorry about your shirt.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.367
Sorry about your face.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.835
[laughs]

21:08.868 --> 21:10.069
Look, we don't got a choice.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.640
Let's just work this case,
all right?

21:13.673 --> 21:15.608
Fine with me.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.013
(Stabler)
Ms. Bixton, do you own a car?

21:21.047 --> 21:22.415
How could we afford a car?

21:22.449 --> 21:23.483
Do you have access to one?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.885
This is New York City.
What do we need a car for?

21:25.918 --> 21:28.988
Excuse me.
Where were Kenny and Mia
two afternoons ago?

21:29.021 --> 21:29.989
At school.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.091
What time
did they get home?
I don't know.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.962
I work in a Laundromat
until 8:00 at night.

21:35.995 --> 21:39.366
Maybe your son knows.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.100
Rudi, tell them.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.070
Where were your brother
and sister Tuesday afternoon?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.772
They came home
after school.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.706
They were here.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.641
Those are some bruises
you got on you, Rudi.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.543
What happened to you?
Did you get in a fight?

21:50.577 --> 21:53.746
I fell down some stairs.
Hurt my leg.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.482
Hurt your hand too?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.617
Broke a couple bones.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.918
(O'Halloran)
Detectives.

22:02.455 --> 22:05.124
Souvenir bat
for the Bronx Gators.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.594
I think it's
what they battered Jessica with.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.328
Hit the lights.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.066
It's blood and skin fragments.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.103
They used this
to beat her unconscious.

22:17.136 --> 22:21.441
And then used it
to sodomize her.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.410
(Stabler)
Do you know what that is, Mia?

22:23.443 --> 22:24.877
You don't have
to answer that.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.479
That was found
in your brother's room,

22:26.513 --> 22:28.047
and it has
Jessica's blood on it.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.384
They could have found that bat
in the street and taken it home.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.756
This your shoe print, Mia?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.024
That's the shoe print

22:38.057 --> 22:42.762
from the scene
where Jessica was found.

22:42.795 --> 22:43.996
Identical.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.832
That doesn't mean
Mia put her there.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.435
(Blaine)
But it sure does
add up.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.169
Pretty soon
we're gonna find the knife

22:50.202 --> 22:52.405
that you used
to cut her with.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.441
Gonna find the van.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.608
And we're gonna
match your blood

22:55.642 --> 22:57.410
to the blood
on her clothes.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.078
Just don't say anything.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.580
(Stabler)
He's right,
you shouldn't say anything

23:00.613 --> 23:02.949
about what you did to Jessica.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.953
Now, what we
wanna know here...

23:06.986 --> 23:08.921
what'd Jessica do to you?

23:12.825 --> 23:14.761
Hmm?

23:14.794 --> 23:16.128
She stole his cap.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.830
Okay, whose cap?

23:17.864 --> 23:19.432
My brother Rudi's.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.601
She was wearing it
at the practice for the concert.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.002
How do you know
it was his?

23:23.035 --> 23:23.970
(Mia)
Because he's the only guy

23:24.003 --> 23:26.706
dumb enough to support
the team the Gators.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.708
It still doesn't mean
that it's his cap.
It was!

23:28.741 --> 23:30.510
Because I asked her
where she got it from.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.211
What'd she say?

23:32.244 --> 23:35.448
She said that she took the cap
off this fat slob

23:35.482 --> 23:38.184
that was stinking up
the park bench.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.019
And that's when I knew.
Knew what?

23:40.052 --> 23:42.455
That she was one of the people
that beat up my brother.

23:42.489 --> 23:46.225
Kicked him so bad
they put him in the hospital.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.527
Cost him his job.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.028
So it was time for payback?

23:49.061 --> 23:50.730
You bet it was.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.033
So you grabbed her,
you beat her, and you cut her.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.536
My brother's hand has gangrene
under the bandage

23:56.569 --> 23:58.237
because of his diabetes.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.239
Doctors had
to cut off three fingers.

24:00.272 --> 24:04.043
I wanted her to suffer
like he did.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.812
Why'd you
sexually assault her?

24:05.845 --> 24:12.084
She called
my sister a pig.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.688
She said pigs shouldn't
be allowed to breed.

24:15.722 --> 24:16.689
(Jessica)
I could never say

24:16.723 --> 24:18.190
such a terrible thing, never.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.593
So if we search your house, will
we find Rudi's baseball cap?

24:20.627 --> 24:22.028
No.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.130
I don't wear baseball caps,
and I don't even know

24:24.163 --> 24:26.566
Rudi Bixton or Mia Bixton--
any of them.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.200
They know you.

24:28.234 --> 24:32.138
That's because they kidnapped
me, did horrible things to me.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.206
They tortured me,

24:34.240 --> 24:38.778
and you're treating me
like it's my fault.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.279
I'm Lionel Granger,
your attorney.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.783
Jessica's mother called me.
This interview is over.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.552
Hey,
we're just talkin'.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.286
You're talking, she's crying.
That's harassment.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.287
Come on, Jessica.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.656
Hey, we believe
she was involved

24:49.689 --> 24:51.090
in a brutal assault.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.260
This alleged assault, is there
a police report of it?

24:54.293 --> 24:56.529
An E.R. report?

24:56.563 --> 24:58.164
That's because
it didn't happen.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.167
Why don't you go do your jobs
and charge the little--sorry--

25:01.200 --> 25:03.736
large bastards who ruined
this girl's life?

25:06.639 --> 25:07.974
Granger's right.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.777
We have nothing on Jessica
and everything on the kids.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.779
I have to charge them
and put them on trial.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.013
Then the case is closed.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.082
What about Rudi?

25:16.115 --> 25:17.617
He's a grown man.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.251
He coulda reported the assault.
He didn't.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.321
And even if he did,
it isn't a case for SVU.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.524
Type up your DD5s
and move on.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.569
Here's my paperwork
on Jessica DeLay.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.676
So what do you want me
to do next, Captain?

25:43.710 --> 25:46.012
[phone rings]

25:46.045 --> 25:48.648
Cragen.

25:48.681 --> 25:53.085
Uh, what?
Cheney shoot somebody else?

25:53.119 --> 25:55.087
A rich white girl gets attacked
and the fine officers

25:55.121 --> 25:56.823
of the NYPD are on it.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.858
Within 48 hours
her attackers are arrested,

25:58.891 --> 26:00.459
charged, arraigned.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.995
Thank you, Assemblyman Molina.
But when a person of color
is beaten nearly

26:03.029 --> 26:04.764
to death,
where are the police?

26:04.797 --> 26:06.699
Where is the outrage?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.735
I mean, must the ghetto always
suffer from unequal justice?

26:08.768 --> 26:12.772
It's just a lot
of hot air.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.041
Yeah. Well, I--

26:15.074 --> 26:17.343
We--Yes, sir.

26:17.376 --> 26:21.848
We're right on it.
Yes, sir.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.816
One Police Plaza.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.619
What I said about Rudi
not being an SVU case--

26:26.653 --> 26:27.687
Um-hmm.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.022
He is now.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.758
[scoffs]

26:34.026 --> 26:36.362
(Molina)
I'm not saying
the police are racists.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.665
All I'm saying is
that if you have money

26:38.698 --> 26:40.800
you get a better kind
of service.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.235
Detectives, it looks like
the TV cameras have

26:43.269 --> 26:44.737
to show up
before you do.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.106
Lucious Blaine,
congratulations

26:47.139 --> 26:50.376
on finally investigating
a three-week-old crime.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.779
We investigate crimes
when they're reported to us.

26:52.812 --> 26:53.780
Right.

26:53.813 --> 26:54.981
You know him?

26:55.014 --> 26:56.983
Grew up
on the same block.

26:57.016 --> 26:57.984
Justice!

26:58.017 --> 26:58.985
(crowd)
For all!

26:59.018 --> 27:01.888
Yeah, I was coming from work.

27:01.921 --> 27:05.658
I stopped for a minute,
must have fallen asleep.

27:05.692 --> 27:08.961
The next thing I know
I got these two devils

27:08.995 --> 27:11.698
kicking and beating on me,

27:11.731 --> 27:18.905
cursing and shouting
that I'm a fat scum.

27:18.938 --> 27:22.241
And to get my fast ass
out of their park.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.776
Did you see any faces?

27:23.810 --> 27:27.680
Don't know
I'd recognize them again.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.716
I was trying to protect my head.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.418
You remember anything else?

27:32.451 --> 27:41.327
At the end, when I couldn't
see through the blood,

27:41.360 --> 27:45.998
I heard one of 'em say,
"Get a picture."

27:46.032 --> 27:50.903
There was a flash.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.740
And they left.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.708
Okay.
Did they take your cap?

28:02.514 --> 28:05.184
Why is it that you
didn't report this, Mr. Bixton?

28:05.217 --> 28:08.420
You don't understand.

28:08.454 --> 28:13.760
No, I don't.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.828
Why would you let

28:15.862 --> 28:19.298
your little brother and sister
fight your fight?

28:19.331 --> 28:20.733
What kind of man are you?

28:20.767 --> 28:23.369
Why are they in jail

28:23.402 --> 28:25.504
when the people who
attacked you should be, huh?

28:25.537 --> 28:31.944
Because I got so damn fat,
I let children beat me.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.079
No names, no faces.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.081
Checked the park where it
happened, no security cameras.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.348
And no forensics.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.450
Been two storms
and a snowfall since the attack.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.852
Rudi mentioned
a camera flash,

28:39.886 --> 28:41.320
could have been taken
with Jessica's phone.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.856
It could have been why Rudi's
brother and sister stole it.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.858
It was.
I was just at Rikers.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.059
Mia told me
she checked the phone,

28:47.093 --> 28:48.260
no pictures
of Rudi on it.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.261
Where's the phone now?

28:49.295 --> 28:50.496
The bottom
of the East River.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.064
But its billing records
are here.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.499
Jessica made lots of calls
in the hours

28:53.532 --> 28:55.501
before and after
Rudi was attacked.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.804
Mostly to two numbers.
One was Tommy Strahan.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.006
(Blaine)
Hey, that's the guy that was
with her in the hospital.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.541
And the other was
an Internet sign-on page.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.443
Maybe she
was emailing something.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.978
Like a photo.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.546
Computer Crimes
is already on it.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.548
Our latest recruit
sweet-talked a subpoena

29:09.581 --> 29:11.117
out of a friendly judge.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.252
And then got Jessica's ISP
to show us exactly

29:13.285 --> 29:14.486
where the girl went
on the web.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.957
Straight to a private website
accessible only by password.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.358
The kind of we normally see
with Jihadists

29:19.391 --> 29:20.893
or child pornographers.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.862
(Benson)
Scratchyouritch.net,
all the latest ways

29:22.895 --> 29:23.662
to vent your hate.

29:23.695 --> 29:26.198
Oh, pet peeves.
Choose your topic.

29:26.232 --> 29:30.536
Fags, spics,
dykes, coons, fatsos.

29:30.569 --> 29:31.637
(Benson)
They're a special favorite.

29:31.670 --> 29:34.206
Even have a thread
about how to get rid of them

29:34.240 --> 29:35.574
including shipping them
to Africa

29:35.607 --> 29:36.809
to feed them
to the starving.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.812
What does this
have to do with our case?
Follow the thread.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.981
You want another way
to get rid of porkers?

29:42.014 --> 29:44.583
Kick 'em into shape.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.385
(Stabler)
That's the park
and the park bench.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.387
(Blaine)
Rudi on the ground.
And that...

29:48.420 --> 29:50.056
(Stabler)
Jessica's friend Tommy Strahan.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.158
(Blaine)
Taken with Jessica's cell phone.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.895
Tommy Strahan.

29:55.928 --> 29:56.963
How can I help you,
Detectives?

29:56.996 --> 29:58.831
You can turn around
because you're under arrest

29:58.865 --> 29:59.832
for assaulting Rudi Bixton.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.868
What are you doing to him?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.135
Jessica DeLay,
you are under arrest

30:03.169 --> 30:05.571
for assaulting Rudi Bixton,
come on.

30:05.604 --> 30:08.474
Luke, call my dad.
Tell him I need a lawyer.

30:14.947 --> 30:18.417
(Novak)
Do you recognize
the girl who attacked you?

30:26.492 --> 30:29.495
(Rudi)
No, I don't see him.

30:29.528 --> 30:35.034
(Novak)
Do you see the man
who attacked you?

30:35.067 --> 30:37.870
Number four.
That's him.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.271
I don't even know
who Rudi Bixton is.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.272
He says he knows you.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.273
He's lying.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.875
He was sitting on a park bench

30:42.909 --> 30:44.376
minding his own business
when you jumped him.

30:44.410 --> 30:45.377
I never touched him.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.946
Yeah, who's this?

30:46.979 --> 30:49.648
(Granger)
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. Strahan.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.185
The only reason you arrested my
client was political pressure.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.055
You have not one scrap
of evidence against him.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.990
We have this
and a positive ID.

30:58.024 --> 30:58.925
What ID?

30:58.958 --> 31:00.659
The victim picked him
out of a line-up.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.429
Only because he'd seen him
on the TV news.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.965
(Newscaster)
People are shocked about
the arrest of two teenagers

31:05.998 --> 31:07.633
in connection with the assault

31:07.666 --> 31:11.170
on East Harlem resident,
Rudi Bixton.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.639
Kids and their
damn camera phones.

31:13.672 --> 31:17.009
That item was first broadcast
30 minutes

31:17.043 --> 31:19.145
before your officers
collected Rudi Bixton

31:19.178 --> 31:20.546
from his home
and brought him here.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.681
You have no proof Rudi saw it.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.383
You have no proof he didn't.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.953
Let's get him in here.
Ask him.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.021
Whatever he says
doesn't change the fact

31:29.055 --> 31:31.657
that your line-up
was contaminated.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.659
No judge will allow
the identification.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.361
Good thing we still got
this photo showing

31:35.394 --> 31:36.462
your client beating up Rudi.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.364
It shows
an unidentifiable man

31:38.397 --> 31:41.100
kicking another
unidentifiable man.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.368
It was taken
by Jessica Delay's cell phone

31:42.401 --> 31:44.470
and posted on the web
the night your client

31:44.503 --> 31:46.505
beat Rudi Bixton
to a pulp.
Impossible.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.540
He was playing poker
at a friend's house that night.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.978
You have nothing.

31:52.011 --> 31:55.081
My client's going home.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.315
Why don't we just talk
to your ADA,

31:56.348 --> 31:57.383
use the Internet photo to get

31:57.416 --> 31:58.450
a warrant
to search Tommy's house?

31:58.484 --> 31:59.618
(Rudi)
Detectives.

31:59.651 --> 32:03.022
(Stabler)
Rudi, what are
you doing back here?

32:03.055 --> 32:05.257
I heard you let the girl go.
Yeah.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.126
What about the guy?

32:07.159 --> 32:10.662
We couldn't hold him.
Not enough evidence.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.133
Had a good lawyer, huh?

32:14.166 --> 32:16.135
(Blaine)
Sorry, man.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.070
Wish you'd come forward
in the first place.

32:18.104 --> 32:21.540
Yeah.
Me too.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.475
Even with a warrant,
Jessica and Tommy

32:23.509 --> 32:26.245
have had plenty of time
to get rid of the evidence.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.547
Yeah, thanks
to their expensive lawyers.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.016
(Rudi)
Hey.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.251
Hey, you!

32:32.284 --> 32:33.519
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.586
Remember me?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.655
He's got a gun!

32:36.688 --> 32:40.626
Drop it!
Drop it!

32:40.659 --> 32:44.696
Somebody call a bus!

32:44.730 --> 32:46.965
Did I kill him?

32:56.108 --> 32:57.476
With all the security
in this building,

32:57.509 --> 32:59.145
how did Rudi
get a gun in here?

32:59.178 --> 33:03.049
Nobody thought to search
the guy in the wheelchair.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.151
What do we do
about Jessica DeLay?

33:05.184 --> 33:07.153
What can we do?
Rudi didn't identify her.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.020
And any half decent lawyer

33:08.054 --> 33:10.089
will pull the Internet photo
to pieces.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.391
Keep digging.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.793
These two psychos,
they started this whole thing.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.562
Yeah.
And they've been punished.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.597
She was raped, beaten,
and mutilated, and he's dead.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.466
If the Bixton family
didn't keep taking the law

33:20.499 --> 33:21.700
into their own hands--

33:21.733 --> 33:24.270
Hey, they have
no reason to trust the law.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.339
(Cragen)
Assemblyman Molina,
what an honor.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.707
Likewise.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.610
I was told I could find
Miss Novak here.

33:31.643 --> 33:35.814
Rudi Bixton, I assume
you're gonna plead him out.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.549
I'll try him
for murder.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.417
Look, he saw the man

33:38.450 --> 33:41.120
who brutalized him
walk free as a bird.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.354
He reacted out
of rage and despair.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.390
And I'm sure the defense
will try that argument.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.792
So if you came here to bully me
into making a deal--

33:46.825 --> 33:49.395
(Molina)
No, I'm here to warn you
that this trial is about more

33:49.428 --> 33:50.729
than Rudi Bixton.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.398
He's just one victim
in an epidemic.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.233
What epidemic?
Obesity.

33:54.266 --> 33:57.103
[Blaine snickering]
And Type Two Diabetes.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.071
No, this trial
is about a murder.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.073
It's about what led up
to a murder.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.441
Now race, class,
and geography

34:02.474 --> 34:04.276
guaranteed that Rudi
would become obese,

34:04.310 --> 34:05.111
would get Diabetes.

34:05.144 --> 34:08.180
Obesity put Rudi
on that park bench.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.581
Made him the victim
of a hate crime.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.383
If you think a judge
is gonna let you

34:11.417 --> 34:12.784
use a health issue
as a smokescreen--

34:12.818 --> 34:15.187
4100 people diagnosed
with Diabetes every day.

34:15.221 --> 34:19.158
55 go blind.
120 have kidney failure.

34:19.191 --> 34:23.162
230 get a limb amputated.
That's every single day.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.097
Is that a smokescreen?

34:25.131 --> 34:26.765
It's got nothing
to do with the case.

34:26.798 --> 34:29.268
Rudi Bixton is the case.

34:29.301 --> 34:33.339
And by the time he's told his
story, no jury will convict him.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.680
(Waldron)
How much do you weigh, Rudi?

34:41.713 --> 34:43.215
(Rudi)
320 pounds.

34:43.249 --> 34:46.752
Have you always been
that heavy?

34:46.785 --> 34:51.223
I guess so.
Most of my family's big.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.359
What is your favorite food
that you remember,

34:53.392 --> 34:57.363
when you were a kid?

34:57.396 --> 34:59.698
Snippy's Snowy Flakes,
the one with the lion

34:59.731 --> 35:01.333
called Snippy on the box.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.735
And why was Snippy
so special?

35:03.769 --> 35:06.138
He was my favorite character
on TV.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.375
And the cereal came
with little toys inside.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.443
Did your family
eat breakfast together?

35:11.477 --> 35:13.245
Moms had to work.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.746
So she would just sit us
in front of the TV

35:14.780 --> 35:15.914
until school time.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.516
What about when you
came home from school?

35:17.549 --> 35:18.750
Did your mom cook dinner?

35:18.784 --> 35:21.587
Are we going to hear about
every meal Mr. Bixton ever ate?

35:21.620 --> 35:22.788
Ms. Waldron.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.423
Your Honor, I'm just trying
to show the jury

35:24.456 --> 35:26.158
how impossible it is
for a child

35:26.192 --> 35:27.659
to learn how
to eat responsibly.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.728
Your Honor--
Especially when the teacher
is not a parent,

35:29.761 --> 35:31.730
but a TV set
whose sole purpose

35:31.763 --> 35:34.666
is to sell him as many sweet
and fatty foods as--

35:34.700 --> 35:36.468
Your Honor, she is testifying.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.605
Jury will ignore
Counsel's last remarks.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.373
You may answer the question.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.242
Moms didn't cook.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.843
She was always tired
from working two jobs.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.446
We'd go out for burgers

35:47.479 --> 35:49.681
or fried chicken,

35:49.715 --> 35:54.220
order in pizza
to eat in front of the TV.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.522
What happened
when you got sick, Rudi?

35:58.724 --> 36:02.294
When I was diagnosed
with Diabetes

36:02.328 --> 36:04.396
I went to a clinic.

36:04.430 --> 36:09.201
I did good too.
I lost nearly 50 pounds.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.669
Had my blood sugar
under control.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.771
And then?

36:12.804 --> 36:13.872
The clinic closed.

36:13.905 --> 36:17.509
Why?

36:17.543 --> 36:19.811
The hospital couldn't afford it.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.947
The insurance company
said it cost too much.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.516
(Waldron)
Do you have
health insurance now?

36:24.550 --> 36:25.551
(Rudi)
No.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.591
Why did you shoot Tommy Strahan?

36:37.529 --> 36:41.367
I was so mad.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.969
It was like
I was blind with rage

36:44.002 --> 36:47.373
because of what he had done
to me and my family.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.341
He was just gonna walk away.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.577
(Waldron)
Are you sorry for what you did?

36:54.380 --> 36:55.914
I am.

36:55.947 --> 36:56.915
(Waldron)
Thank you.

36:56.948 --> 37:01.353
Your witness.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.589
That's a very sad story,
Mr. Bixton.

37:03.622 --> 37:04.590
Thank you for sharing.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.358
You're welcome.

37:06.392 --> 37:09.328
Now, the sequence of events
on the day of the shooting,

37:09.361 --> 37:10.996
you picked Tommy Strahan
out of a line-up.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.664
Yes.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.500
Then you went home,
you got a gun,

37:14.533 --> 37:17.403
and you returned
to the police station.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.404
Yeah.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.971
And then because you were

37:20.005 --> 37:23.275
blind with rage, and he was
just going to walk away,

37:23.309 --> 37:24.943
you shot him.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.044
Yeah.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.913
So you must have known
he was going

37:27.946 --> 37:30.349
to walk before you got the gun.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.850
That's right.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.820
How did you know?

37:37.523 --> 37:38.724
You didn't.

37:38.757 --> 37:43.562
Be honest, you were gonna shoot
him no matter what happened.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.364
He could have been
on his way to court,

37:45.397 --> 37:47.599
you still
would have shot him.

37:47.633 --> 37:48.700
No.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.436
You weren't blind
with rage.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.704
You planned
the entire thing.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.373
He beat you.
He humiliated you.

37:54.406 --> 37:58.410
You wanted to prove
that you were a man.

37:58.444 --> 38:01.747
You aren't sorry
you shot him, are you?

38:01.780 --> 38:06.452
Are you?

38:06.485 --> 38:09.555
No.

38:09.588 --> 38:12.858
I'm glad he's dead.

38:12.891 --> 38:16.828
And I'd do it again.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.335
Nothing further.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.874
How'd it go?

38:28.907 --> 38:30.041
Wonderful.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.478
I goaded the gentle giant
until he snapped.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.880
Detective Tutuola found
our baseball cap.

38:34.913 --> 38:38.417
Perched on the pretty
little head of Jessica DeLay.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.686
It's the Bronx Gators.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.488
We got her.
And when and where
was this taken?

38:42.521 --> 38:45.424
The security camera
at Coretta Scott King High.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.460
The day she showed up there
for concert practice.

38:48.494 --> 38:49.928
I found something else
on Jessica.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.130
Are you working
this case now?

38:52.163 --> 38:53.699
I've been following
her postings online.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.700
She's obsessed.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.368
With what?

38:56.402 --> 38:57.268
Weight.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.505
I took a look
at her high school yearbook.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.540
She hasn't been at that
fancy private school very long.

39:01.573 --> 39:02.641
Where was she before?

39:02.674 --> 39:06.011
Some very interesting places.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.817
There she is.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.152
Have a seat right there.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.153
Shouldn't I have
my lawyer here?

39:15.186 --> 39:16.955
No.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.690
You're not under arrest.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.392
(Stabler)
We just need help
with something.

39:20.426 --> 39:25.397
You said you never wore
that baseball cap.

39:25.431 --> 39:26.865
There it is on your head.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.166
(Blaine)
Yeah, Rudi's sister
Mia said

39:28.199 --> 39:30.669
that you told her
you took it off a--

39:30.702 --> 39:32.604
what was that again,
partner?

39:32.638 --> 39:35.006
A fat slob stinking up
a park bench.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.743
Yeah.
I didn't say that.
She's lying.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.912
I found that hat.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.180
You can't keep me here.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.984
No, no, you're free to go
whenever you want.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.053
You hate fat people,
don't you?

39:48.086 --> 39:51.923
No, I don't mind them.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.124
What about me?

39:53.158 --> 39:55.694
I'm kinda heavy.
Do I disgust you?

39:55.727 --> 39:56.695
No.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.564
Come on!

39:58.597 --> 40:00.198
You see a 300-pound mountain
shoving food in his mouth

40:00.231 --> 40:01.867
in a restaurant,
that doesn't make you sick?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.535
People can't help
being black

40:03.569 --> 40:05.671
or gay, but being fat, well,
that's their fault, right?

40:05.704 --> 40:09.040
No pride, no self-control.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.442
Check this one out
right here.

40:10.476 --> 40:11.209
Look at her.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.711
She's a heifer.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.212
(Stabler)
Jessica DeLay, age 14.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.515
Where did you get that?
Jessica, aged 15.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.451
230 pounds, and this is
from your yearbook

40:19.485 --> 40:21.987
at Hidden Glades Ranch
in California--what's that?

40:22.020 --> 40:26.558
A very exclusive school
for very heavy teens.

40:26.592 --> 40:29.495
Good diet, lots of exercise,
strict supervision.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.328
Why are you doing this?

40:30.361 --> 40:33.732
The final result
is this right here.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.568
A beautiful young girl
who hates fat people.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.603
Stop it!
Please!

40:37.636 --> 40:38.737
'Cause she used
to be one herself.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.741
Stop!
You don't know what it's like!

40:42.774 --> 40:46.512
People staring at you
every bite that you eat.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.547
The jokes.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.082
Do you sleep in a crate?

40:51.116 --> 40:58.524
Broken any benches lately?
You're a leper!

40:58.557 --> 41:02.694
(Blaine)
Is that how
you saw Rudi Bixton?

41:02.728 --> 41:06.498
Is that why
you attacked him?

41:06.532 --> 41:07.566
Tommy started it.

41:07.599 --> 41:09.701
(Stabler)
Yeah, but you joined in.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.870
Yes.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.940
I couldn't stand
the sight of him.

41:14.973 --> 41:18.544
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.484
[sighs heavily]

41:28.587 --> 41:30.989
So you'll give this
to the defense?

41:31.022 --> 41:33.592
Yeah, but it
won't help Rudi much.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.562
Some of Jessica's
money might have.

41:36.595 --> 41:41.099
Like they say, "You can never be
too rich or too thin."

41:46.938 --> 41:49.841
(male judge)
In the case of
The People vs. Rudi Bixton:

41:49.875 --> 41:51.777
On the sole count
of the indictment,

41:51.810 --> 41:54.646
murder in the second degree,
how do you find?

41:54.680 --> 41:59.918
(jury forewoman)
We find the defendant...

41:59.951 --> 42:01.553
guilty.

42:01.587 --> 42:02.588
[gavel bangs]

42:02.621 --> 42:04.522
This court is adjourned.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.126
Where's Rudi?
I don't know.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.729
I didn't have a chance
to find out from Roger.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.270
You heard the verdict?

42:19.304 --> 42:23.208
I was there.
Rudi wasn't.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.110
What happened?

42:25.143 --> 42:26.344
He was rushed
to the hospital.

42:26.377 --> 42:32.350
Double whammy--kidney failure
and his left foot amputated.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.752
Guilty verdict's
kind of irrelevant

42:33.785 --> 42:39.157
when he's under
a death sentence anyhow.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.826
You leaving?

42:40.859 --> 42:43.294
Captain said to close
the case and move on.

42:43.328 --> 42:47.666
So I'm moving on.

42:47.699 --> 42:52.303
I won't say
it's been a pleasure.

42:52.337 --> 42:53.304
Take care.

42:53.338 --> 42:55.340
Yeah.

43:06.284 --> 43:09.287
