<i>Would you raise your right
hand, please?</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:29.444
<i>Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth</i>

00:29.445 --> 00:31.884
<i>- and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
- Yeah.</i>

00:31.885 --> 00:34.684
<i>Would you please give us
your full name?</i>

00:34.685 --> 00:36.564
<i>Lance Armstrong.</i>

00:36.565 --> 00:39.804
<i>You understand that although we're in
the conference room of your lawyers,</i>

00:39.805 --> 00:43.044
<i>you are giving testimony as
if you are in a court of law?</i>

00:43.045 --> 00:44.964
<i>- Do you understand that?
- Correct.</i>

00:44.965 --> 00:48.524
<i>And that penalties of perjury
attach to this deposition</i>

00:48.525 --> 00:51.685
<i>- just like they would to a court of law proceeding.
- Of course.</i>

00:53.645 --> 00:55.244
<i>There's been allegations</i>

00:55.245 --> 00:58.884
<i>regarding what has been alleged to
be a steroid or cortisone in
connection...</i>

00:58.885 --> 01:02.484
<i>- What do you mean, a steroid or a cortisone?
- Cortisone, I apologise.</i>

01:02.485 --> 01:06.604
- Because they're different.
- <i>I understand, believe me.</i>

01:06.605 --> 01:09.605
<i>One is actually anabolic
and one is actually catabolic.</i>

01:12.445 --> 01:14.564
<i>Know what they've done with
the money?</i>

01:14.565 --> 01:16.324
<i>I just told you I don't know.</i>

01:16.325 --> 01:19.765
<i>- Was it earmarked...
- Which part of "I don't know"
do you not understand?</i>

01:22.485 --> 01:25.924
<i>- I'm just trying to make sure your testimony is clear.
- How many times do I have to say it?</i>

01:25.925 --> 01:28.284
<i>It can't be any clear than
"I've never taken drugs."</i>

01:28.285 --> 01:29.844
<i>How clear is that?</i>

01:38.525 --> 01:42.564
<i>His name is Lance Armstrong,
and today, if his legs feel strong,</i>

01:42.565 --> 01:44.484
<i>this 21-year-old Texan can become</i>

01:44.485 --> 01:46.645
<i>cycling's first million-dollar baby.</i>

01:48.445 --> 01:50.884
<i>Regardless of
the million-dollar prize,</i>

01:50.885 --> 01:53.324
<i>it's been a race that
I wanted to win all year long</i>

01:53.325 --> 01:56.924
<i>and now with that staring me in the
face, it's an even bigger race.</i>

01:56.925 --> 02:00.764
<i>He's going for his third consecutive
victory with only today's
four states championship</i>

02:00.765 --> 02:04.044
<i>standing in the way of winning the
Thrift Drug Triple Crown -</i>

02:04.045 --> 02:05.364
<i>look out Philadelphia,</i>

02:05.365 --> 02:06.685
<i>Lance is coming to town!</i>

02:08.645 --> 02:11.724
There was this million-dollar prize,
if Lance Armstrong

02:11.725 --> 02:14.205
could win, so all the pressure
was on him, it was on the team.

02:16.085 --> 02:18.844
Thing is, he was the favourite
going in - he was strong,

02:18.845 --> 02:20.324
he was beating up on everybody.

02:20.325 --> 02:22.565
<i>I'll be disappointed with anything
but a win.</i>

02:24.925 --> 02:26.764
Lance had the chance to win it.

02:26.765 --> 02:30.965
But he knows, the man to beat
that day, it was me.

02:33.725 --> 02:38.764
Philadelphia - it was my race, every
year I was preparing for that race.

02:38.765 --> 02:40.844
<i>And Frankie Andreu of Motorola</i>

02:40.845 --> 02:43.044
<i>who has slowed down the brakes...</i>

02:43.045 --> 02:47.324
I remember Lance made a deal
with some Italians.

02:47.325 --> 02:49.284
Stephen Swart,

02:49.285 --> 02:54.524
Davis Phinney, Tommy,
the team have this deal with Lance.

02:54.525 --> 02:58.765
<i>Lance Armstrong is flying up the wall,
making it look almost effortless!</i>

02:59.725 --> 03:03.365
The last three laps is
when the race is decided.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.604
That's
when Lance starts talking to me,

03:06.605 --> 03:08.924
he wants to make sure that
I was in the plan,

03:08.925 --> 03:10.885
didn't want to take any risk.

03:12.005 --> 03:14.364
And he say, "We make a deal,

03:14.365 --> 03:16.644
and I know you're the only one
can come with me,

03:16.645 --> 03:18.244
but don't come with me."

03:18.245 --> 03:20.484
<i>And right on cue,
Lance is out of the saddle,</i>

03:20.485 --> 03:22.484
<i>pushing himself into a higher gear.</i>

03:22.485 --> 03:26.644
On my heart, on my deep heart,
I don't want to do it,

03:26.645 --> 03:30.364
but when you have eight team-mates,
you can't go against the team.

03:30.365 --> 03:34.124
<i>The group could do nothing but watch
Lance dance away into the lead</i>

03:34.125 --> 03:37.564
<i>as they, compared to Lance,
seemed to be standing still.</i>

03:37.565 --> 03:41.645
And so I pulled back and see him
going. And he went.

03:47.885 --> 03:50.724
<i>And true to form, Lance doesn't
disappoint them.</i>

03:50.725 --> 03:54.604
<i>Cycling's first million-dollar man,
US Pro champion!</i>

03:54.605 --> 03:57.124
Deep inside, I feel terrible,
because I know I could have,

03:57.125 --> 03:58.644
I could have won it.

03:58.645 --> 04:02.124
<i>For Lance, a joyous celebration
with his mother.</i>

04:02.125 --> 04:05.724
<i>The success that Lance has seen
and will continue to see</i>

04:05.725 --> 04:09.684
<i>of course makes me very proud,
there's not a better gift.</i>

04:09.685 --> 04:13.124
<i>Lance has rolled the dice and come
up a winner.</i>

04:13.125 --> 04:16.844
<i>It's a big day for me but I think
it's a bigger day for cycling,</i>

04:16.845 --> 04:18.925
<i>everybody won today.</i>

04:20.084 --> 04:22.604
As far as I know, Philly's been
going around for 30 years

04:22.605 --> 04:24.524
and I don't think that's ever been
done before.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.245
So, that's a huge chunk of change.

04:29.885 --> 04:34.804
After the race, Lance
come to my room,

04:34.805 --> 04:40.204
with a cake box, a metal
cake box, a Panettone

04:40.205 --> 04:43.325
and he just gave it to me
and say "Merry Christmas."

04:47.365 --> 04:49.805
It was, like, $100,000.

04:51.085 --> 04:53.004
Cash.

04:53.005 --> 04:55.725
This was a... This was
a Lance Armstrong specialty.

04:59.325 --> 05:01.444
I really want to win a classic.

05:01.445 --> 05:03.644
<i>I mean, if you're going to put
a lot of time into it,</i>

05:03.645 --> 05:05.604
<i>if I'm going to be
18, 19, 20 years old</i>

05:05.605 --> 05:07.644
<i>and I'm going to give up
an education,</i>

05:07.645 --> 05:09.644
<i>- if I'm going to give up...
- That is what you did?</i>

05:09.645 --> 05:12.004
<i>Yeah, if I'm going to give
up time at home,</i>

05:12.005 --> 05:15.324
<i>sure, it better be rewarding,
in terms of money.</i>

05:15.325 --> 05:17.044
Always in the back of Lance's mind

05:17.045 --> 05:21.404
was that great fortunes can be made
in professional road racing.

05:21.405 --> 05:27.404
And for a poor kid growing up, hard
scrabble in Texas, it's important.

05:27.405 --> 05:31.845
The next progression is to race
in Europe, in the biggest pro races.

05:34.725 --> 05:37.364
Como, Italy, was kind of like
the American base.

05:37.365 --> 05:39.964
A lot of 7-Eleven guys were living
there, and at that time,

05:39.965 --> 05:41.044
Lance and I,

05:41.045 --> 05:43.684
I don't know how we got into
the discussion, but we decided,

05:43.685 --> 05:46.844
"Hey, we'll live together for next
year" and so I was like, "Sweet.

05:46.845 --> 05:48.604
It'll be good, it'll be fun."

05:48.605 --> 05:51.204
It was great. You know, cooking,
having risotto.

05:51.205 --> 05:54.924
I remember eating watermelon out on the
balcony and we had this bad little car,

05:54.925 --> 05:56.884
that we used to get around.

05:56.885 --> 05:58.284
I mean, we weren't teenagers,

05:58.285 --> 06:00.764
but it was like teenagers
just hanging out in Europe.

06:00.765 --> 06:05.684
Frankie was Lance's closest friend,
and because I was dating Frankie,

06:05.685 --> 06:09.644
I became friends with Lance as well,
and he was fun.

06:09.645 --> 06:11.484
He was fun to hang out with.

06:11.485 --> 06:14.324
And Lance and I had a unique
relationship,

06:14.325 --> 06:20.044
because so many people from early on
would just kow-tow to him,

06:20.045 --> 06:26.284
but with Lance, he would try to rib
me, and try to just get me going,

06:26.285 --> 06:29.844
and so we would butt heads and
we would argue.

06:29.845 --> 06:35.805
But we kind of, I think, enjoyed
getting under each other's skin.

06:41.565 --> 06:44.004
Hello again, and welcome back to
the Tour de France.

06:44.005 --> 06:47.804
We're at Stage 8 this morning and
the sun is still shining...

06:47.805 --> 06:50.204
The Tour de France...

06:50.205 --> 06:51.645
...REALLY hard.

06:53.285 --> 06:57.524
Racing bikes in Europe is bad for
you, it's not healthy.

06:57.525 --> 06:59.924
You sacrifice a lot to be
successful.

07:04.765 --> 07:07.764
At the Tour de France, I was rooming
with Lance, and I was like,

07:07.765 --> 07:10.204
"Lance, this is your day.
This is the one you can win."

07:10.205 --> 07:12.604
And he was like, "Really, you
think so?" I'm like, "Yeah!"

07:12.605 --> 07:15.084
<i>Armstrong is fifth down the
line...</i>

07:15.085 --> 07:16.884
<i>Armstrong has the advantage...</i>

07:16.885 --> 07:18.884
It's got, like,
a little 6K climb at the end,

07:18.885 --> 07:21.484
I mean, it's power downhill sprint,
it's perfect.

07:21.485 --> 07:23.964
And on that day, the whole team
committed,

07:23.965 --> 07:26.004
led him out to the bottom of that
climb

07:26.005 --> 07:27.844
and pretty much, "All right, go!"

07:27.845 --> 07:32.284
<i>Armstrong boxed in by Dominique Arnould, who
won the first stage of the Tour a year ago.</i>

07:32.285 --> 07:35.404
<i>They've pushed Armstrong very,
very wide indeed as Pensec goes</i>

07:35.405 --> 07:38.444
<i>and Pensec really isn't a sprinter,
this would be a surprise.</i>

07:38.445 --> 07:41.964
<i>Ronan Pensec leading out, now Armstrong
goes, on the left of the picture,</i>

07:41.965 --> 07:45.884
<i>Lance Armstrong in his first Tour de
France, they all said he was too young,</i>

07:45.885 --> 07:47.925
<i>but he gets it on the line!</i>

07:49.485 --> 07:54.084
We met at the Motorola Hotel, he was
only 21 years of age, he was riding

07:54.085 --> 07:55.684
the Tour for the first time

07:55.685 --> 07:58.404
and in that pathetic way of
sports writers,

07:58.405 --> 08:00.924
we like to be able to say
at some future point,

08:00.925 --> 08:02.004
"Oh, you know,

08:02.005 --> 08:04.644
I interviewed Lance when he was
just a kid in his first Tour",

08:04.645 --> 08:06.644
it was going to be like
a badge of honour.

08:06.645 --> 08:09.004
<i>That was a lot of fun.
That was really -</i>

08:09.005 --> 08:12.284
<i>I think, just the way it went
down with the last climb</i>

08:12.285 --> 08:16.444
<i>and guys were attacking
and I was so motivated...</i>

08:16.445 --> 08:20.324
When I asked him about what he felt
like coming towards the end of race,

08:20.325 --> 08:24.764
he said, "Oh, when I get in the situation
with the little group of 6 or 8 riders

08:24.765 --> 08:30.244
and I know I've got a real chance of winning"
he said, "I start to shriek and my body shakes.

08:30.245 --> 08:34.565
And I think about my mum -
she didn't raise a quitter."

08:38.684 --> 08:41.684
I had this sense of a guy
who just wouldn't be beaten.

08:43.365 --> 08:46.364
Who through the force of his will
and his personality,

08:46.365 --> 08:48.965
became almost somebody different.

08:49.725 --> 08:51.444
<i>There's Dekker on the floor again!</i>

08:51.445 --> 08:53.844
<i>And Lance Armstrong
has sprinted the gap closed...</i>

08:53.845 --> 08:56.564
<i>Lance Armstrong, who has joined...</i>

08:56.565 --> 08:59.044
<i>Now he's looking back and seeing
nobody</i>

08:59.045 --> 09:01.204
<i>as he become champion of the world.</i>

09:01.205 --> 09:03.524
<i>Lance Armstrong, 21 years of age,</i>

09:03.525 --> 09:08.084
<i>is America's second only
World ever Road Race Champion,</i>

09:08.085 --> 09:10.964
<i>beating the greatest
man of the moment in world cycling,</i>

09:10.965 --> 09:12.084
<i>Miguel Indurain.</i>

09:12.085 --> 09:15.285
<i>He raised a smile there, but I
think Miguel, very disappointed.</i>

09:18.125 --> 09:20.124
<i>And could it be that we're
watching the man</i>

09:20.125 --> 09:22.844
<i>who will replace the great
Greg LeMond in the years ahead,</i>

09:22.845 --> 09:24.085
<i>Lance Armstrong now.</i>

09:31.605 --> 09:35.844
<i>Indurain goes now, in what to him
will hopefully re-establish him</i>

09:35.845 --> 09:37.284
<i>as the best rider...</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:38.604
Through 1993,

09:38.605 --> 09:41.564
the races just increased,
the speeds were so dramatic,

09:41.565 --> 09:42.764
it was night and day.

09:49.765 --> 09:52.804
One of the riders was told what was
going on in the Spanish team.

09:52.805 --> 09:56.005
The rider just said,
"Pfft, you guys have no chance.

09:57.285 --> 10:00.044
We're doing EPO, growth hormone,
testosterone.

10:00.045 --> 10:01.524
You'll never make it."

10:01.525 --> 10:05.405
<i>He comes up to the line, 1 hour 50
and 58, 2 minutes precisely!</i>

10:07.805 --> 10:09.924
<i>Well, the way that guy came by...</i>

10:09.925 --> 10:13.244
<i>and that was probably part of the
reason that I'm so wasted in the end</i>

10:13.245 --> 10:15.724
<i>because I tried to match his speed</i>

10:15.725 --> 10:21.164
<i>and he goes along the flats 55, 56,
57 K's an hour, I was 53.11.</i>

10:21.165 --> 10:23.005
<i>Getting dropped!</i>

10:28.525 --> 10:32.844
We're talking about the speed
of the peloton and this new drug EPO

10:32.845 --> 10:35.444
and talking about Dr. Ferrari.

10:35.445 --> 10:38.924
Lance would have known Ferrari
by reputation.

10:38.925 --> 10:43.164
Now he wanted to meet the man
and start working with him.

10:43.165 --> 10:46.004
Ferrari had a reputation of being
the best in the business.

10:46.005 --> 10:48.404
If you wanted to win
races, win the Tour,

10:48.405 --> 10:51.284
you go see this guy and he's going
to set you up.

10:51.285 --> 10:54.244
As good as that reputation was,
everybody knew that if you went

10:54.245 --> 10:56.284
to see Ferrari, you were going
to get doped.

10:56.285 --> 10:59.004
So Lance kept it a secret
from everyone for a long time.

10:59.005 --> 11:03.484
And Lance had the intelligence
to see that Ferrari was special

11:03.485 --> 11:06.564
in terms of his understanding
of physiology,

11:06.565 --> 11:09.524
and of the drugs and how
they interacted.

11:09.525 --> 11:12.764
With his charisma
and his natural intelligence,

11:12.765 --> 11:15.484
Lance was able to endear himself
to Ferrari,

11:15.485 --> 11:20.004
become the Adam of what would be
Ferrari's creation.

11:20.005 --> 11:22.084
You keep doing your job
as Frankenstein

11:22.085 --> 11:26.524
and I'll be the best monster
you've ever created.

11:26.525 --> 11:28.844
And Ferrari loved him for that.

11:28.845 --> 11:31.965
You know, the pupil from heaven.

11:34.165 --> 11:36.324
The train just started rolling
full blast,

11:36.325 --> 11:38.244
just like, it was just...

11:38.245 --> 11:40.405
reefing across the landscape.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.484
<i>It is, he's gone.
Armstrong has gone,</i>

11:44.485 --> 11:47.724
<i>the sort of thing he did
in the World Championship at Oslo.</i>

11:47.725 --> 11:50.604
<i>Is this man on the start of his
greatest ever season?</i>

11:50.605 --> 11:53.764
<i>Travelling at nearly 40mph,</i>

11:53.765 --> 11:56.284
<i>Armstrong showing enormous
determination.</i>

11:56.285 --> 12:01.004
You couldn't develop a product more
perfect for the ravages

12:01.005 --> 12:03.165
of endurance athletics than EPO.

12:05.005 --> 12:08.684
<i>Armstrong has done it today.</i>

12:08.685 --> 12:11.084
EPO was done in secret.

12:11.085 --> 12:13.124
You never knew what anybody
else was doing.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.364
Even for the top, top guys,

12:14.365 --> 12:17.604
they never knew what the other guy
was doing, so everybody thought

12:17.605 --> 12:20.845
they had to do more in order to be
able to win, or to keep up.

12:24.725 --> 12:27.164
I was tired of getting beat up on,

12:27.165 --> 12:30.644
tired of getting dropped
and watching fat sprinters get over

12:30.645 --> 12:34.364
category-one climbs and win. Getting
thrown out the back of the group.

12:34.365 --> 12:37.124
"I'm going to, I'm not going to."
You know, sleepless nights,

12:37.125 --> 12:39.244
figuring out, and then...

12:39.245 --> 12:42.884
<i>- You did a great job.
- We're going, "That's our Frankie!"</i>

12:42.885 --> 12:45.284
<i>- That's great. Congratulations.
- Thanks a lot.</i>

12:45.285 --> 12:48.125
<i>Have you been enjoying
the Tour de France?</i>

12:50.725 --> 12:52.164
<i>No comment.</i>

12:52.165 --> 12:54.204
Sure enough,
eventually I cracked.

12:54.205 --> 12:58.244
Yeah, drove to Switzerland
and pretty much just walked

12:58.245 --> 13:01.244
into a pharmacy, just like, could
have bought chewing gum.

13:01.245 --> 13:02.404
It was that easy.

13:02.405 --> 13:03.964
<i>But then the punch-up started.</i>

13:03.965 --> 13:07.205
<i>Lance Armstrong, number 61 for
the Motorola Team.</i>

13:08.405 --> 13:10.604
When you're racing,
you think you're invincible.

13:10.605 --> 13:13.084
You think you can do anything,
nothing's going to stop you,

13:13.085 --> 13:15.285
nothing's going to harm you and then
all of a sudden...

13:22.805 --> 13:26.284
<i>From the beginning of the Tour,
I knew that I was a step off,</i>

13:26.285 --> 13:29.244
<i>and a lot of times when your body
is down like that,</i>

13:29.245 --> 13:32.445
<i>then a virus or any illness will move
in and take over.</i>

13:38.965 --> 13:44.364
<i>That evening the phone rings,
and I hear Lance's neighbour</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:47.804
<i>on the other end, and he said
"Linda, I don't know any easy way</i>

13:47.805 --> 13:51.645
<i>to tell you this, but Lance has
been diagnosed with cancer."</i>

13:53.325 --> 13:58.045
<i>It literally crushed every
single piece of me on the inside.</i>

14:00.805 --> 14:05.124
<i>On Wednesday October 2nd, I was
diagnosed with testicular cancer.</i>

14:05.125 --> 14:07.124
<i>Prior to seeing my doctor last week,</i>

14:07.125 --> 14:08.964
<i>I'd been experiencing swelling</i>

14:08.965 --> 14:10.604
<i>and pain in one of my testicles,</i>

14:10.605 --> 14:12.165
<i>and I'd coughed up some blood.</i>

14:13.565 --> 14:15.364
<i>On Thursday October 3rd, I underwent</i>

14:15.365 --> 14:16.884
<i>surgery at St David's hospital</i>

14:16.885 --> 14:19.605
<i>here in Austin, to have
the malignant testicle removed.</i>

14:20.725 --> 14:23.564
<i>A CAT scan was also performed
the same day.</i>

14:23.565 --> 14:27.405
<i>The CAT scan revealed that my
condition has spread into my abdomen.</i>

14:30.725 --> 14:33.564
At the time, I think most people
would have suggested,

14:33.565 --> 14:36.604
with the brain metastases and such,

14:36.605 --> 14:41.004
that at best you'd cure maybe one
out of three of those people.

14:41.005 --> 14:45.684
It was awful, and I thought how
in the hell does a guy

14:45.685 --> 14:48.885
who's in such good shape,
so young, get cancer?

14:52.445 --> 14:54.724
The first impression I got,

14:54.725 --> 14:57.484
which is the impression
I get from a lot of people,

14:57.485 --> 14:59.164
is that he was scared.

14:59.165 --> 15:02.724
He was certainly looking
at very primal aspects.

15:02.725 --> 15:05.284
You know, saving his life or not,

15:05.285 --> 15:08.524
and a lot of secondary
consequences - his career,

15:08.525 --> 15:11.445
family, future kids.
All that.

15:13.365 --> 15:17.404
We wanted to go see Lance,
and the time to see him

15:17.405 --> 15:19.204
was after his brain surgery,

15:19.205 --> 15:22.804
and so Frankie and I made the
six-hour drive to Indiana.

15:22.805 --> 15:26.724
And that was the first time I'd
seen him since the announcement,

15:26.725 --> 15:29.364
and I remember seeing
the big horseshoe scar

15:29.365 --> 15:30.645
on the top of his head.

15:32.485 --> 15:34.884
We went into the room
and it was a football game,

15:34.885 --> 15:38.124
Dallas Cowboys football game
was playing. So he was in there,

15:38.125 --> 15:40.804
his girlfriend at the time
Lisa Shields was there,

15:40.805 --> 15:43.684
and Stephanie McIlvain,
the rep from Oakley was there.

15:43.685 --> 15:47.404
Chris Carmichael, his coach,
was there with Paige, I think.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.004
And the doctors came in, and when
the doctors came in...

15:50.005 --> 15:52.684
...they said, "Oh, you know, we need
to ask you some questions."

15:52.685 --> 15:55.124
I said, "We should leave,
let him have his privacy."

15:55.125 --> 15:57.564
And Lance said, "No, no, no.
Don't worry about it.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.924
You guys can stay, no problem."
And I said, "OK, we'll stay."

16:00.925 --> 16:05.324
They asked a few banal questions,
and then one of them was.

16:05.325 --> 16:09.564
"Have you ever used any
performance-enhancing drugs?"

16:09.565 --> 16:13.964
And Lance, just nonchalantly holding
on to his IV, staring down,

16:13.965 --> 16:18.805
rattled off, "Yeah, EPO, testosterone,
growth hormone, cortisone and steroids."

16:20.445 --> 16:24.004
And at that point my
jaw was, like, holy shit,

16:24.005 --> 16:26.004
because Betsy's sitting
right next to me.

16:26.005 --> 16:28.044
I don't know what the hell
she's thinking.

16:28.045 --> 16:29.684
And I was like, "We got to go."

16:29.685 --> 16:32.684
And we stood up and walked
out of the room, right away.

16:32.685 --> 16:34.444
I was furious,
because I said to him,

16:34.445 --> 16:36.204
"That's how Lance got his cancer,

16:36.205 --> 16:38.644
and if you're doing that,
I'm not marrying you."

16:38.645 --> 16:41.084
We were just engaged
six weeks earlier.

16:41.085 --> 16:43.964
She was upset that
he was taking that stuff.

16:43.965 --> 16:47.724
She was crazy, like, if I was taking
that stuff, then if you're

16:47.725 --> 16:50.964
taking all that stuff, it obviously
is going to affect your health.

16:50.965 --> 16:54.964
Because I thought, "Oh, my gosh,
is this going on?

16:54.965 --> 16:58.924
Is everybody doing this?"
And Frankie swore to me no.

16:58.925 --> 17:02.124
Had to do with trust,
and is she going to marry me?

17:02.125 --> 17:04.523
So, you know, it was, yeah,
you know, I think she even

17:04.525 --> 17:07.444
right there on the spot threatened,
like, "I'm not marrying you,

17:07.444 --> 17:09.684
if you're doing all that stuff."

17:09.685 --> 17:11.724
I was just ready to call
the whole thing off.

17:16.765 --> 17:18.324
Before cancer,

17:18.325 --> 17:21.044
Lance had signed up for
the French Team Cofidis.

17:21.045 --> 17:24.243
It wasn't know if he would live or
race bikes again.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.523
All of those things were not known.

17:26.525 --> 17:29.964
<i>I still have a ways to
go on the bike.</i>

17:29.965 --> 17:32.884
<i>Does it sound like some kind of
miracle cure?</i>

17:32.885 --> 17:36.884
<i>No, it's not a miracle.
Everything was...</i>

17:36.885 --> 17:38.964
<i>The therapy was normal therapy.</i>

17:38.965 --> 17:41.645
<i>I had to do just as much
as everybody else.</i>

17:45.125 --> 17:49.604
He made the decision to go because
they were astonished to see him

17:49.605 --> 17:51.964
there, and then he decided he would
carry on to Italy

17:51.965 --> 17:54.964
and see Michele Ferrari,
for what would have been

17:54.965 --> 17:58.924
really just
a friend-to-friend visit.

17:58.925 --> 18:01.164
That is extraordinary,

18:01.165 --> 18:02.884
because it indicated

18:02.885 --> 18:04.964
that in a relatively short time,

18:04.965 --> 18:07.764
he and Michele Ferrari
had become very close,

18:07.765 --> 18:10.844
and it was also a visit to say,

18:10.845 --> 18:15.244
"If I come back and I make a full
recovery, I'm going to achieve

18:15.245 --> 18:18.844
everything I ever wanted to
achieve, whatever it takes,

18:18.845 --> 18:21.805
and I want you working with me."

18:24.245 --> 18:26.284
<i>The American Mafia.</i>

18:26.285 --> 18:28.564
Took him a long
time to find a team

18:28.565 --> 18:31.044
and a structure that would
make it worthwhile.

18:31.045 --> 18:34.645
<i>When I tried to come back,
there was no interest. None.</i>

18:37.885 --> 18:41.724
<i>And then finally signed the deal
with the US Postal Team.</i>

18:41.725 --> 18:44.524
<i>I think that if I were to come back
and to win,</i>

18:44.525 --> 18:48.804
<i>and to be successful, I would
consider that a complete recovery,</i>

18:48.805 --> 18:50.604
<i>as an athlete.</i>

18:50.605 --> 18:54.124
As much as Lance wanted to win,
Thom Weisel wanted to win,

18:54.125 --> 18:57.205
and he was the creator
of the US Postal Team.

18:59.045 --> 19:05.084
People talk about Lance being this
kind of ruthless alpha male leader.

19:05.085 --> 19:09.324
Thom Weisel was one of those.
You know, a ruthless guy.

19:09.325 --> 19:13.604
Lance's first contract
was for minimal wages.

19:13.605 --> 19:16.844
Weisel said, "Go out there,
win races,

19:16.845 --> 19:20.684
prove you're back competitive
and I'll give you a huge bonus."

19:20.685 --> 19:24.085
And he went after those bonuses
like, tooth and nail.

19:30.285 --> 19:34.525
<i>Lance, that's 40 seconds on Masolini
and one minute and ten seconds.</i>

19:39.045 --> 19:42.844
On certain teams, you have riders
that are acquaintances.

19:42.845 --> 19:45.244
<i>He was just smiling a minute ago!</i>

19:45.245 --> 19:46.924
Or co-workers.

19:46.925 --> 19:50.284
That '99 Tour Team,
we were friends and good friends.

19:50.285 --> 19:52.364
We were just, we were close.

19:52.365 --> 19:55.124
It was a close-knit group of riders.

19:55.125 --> 19:59.244
Hincapie, Livingston,
Vande Velde, Lance,

19:59.245 --> 20:01.524
and we would do anything
for each other.

20:01.525 --> 20:04.204
<i>I hate the French.
Screw the French.</i>

20:04.205 --> 20:07.484
Frankie was on that team,
Tyler Hamilton was on that team.

20:07.485 --> 20:09.804
When I got selected to do the team,

20:09.805 --> 20:11.964
I told my parents.
I told them to come over

20:11.965 --> 20:14.884
because this is probably
the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

20:14.885 --> 20:16.325
to see me in the Tour de France.

20:18.765 --> 20:22.044
Lance, Kristin, Frankie and I
were driving

20:22.045 --> 20:27.524
from Milano to Sanremo, and Lance
had to make a stop to see Ferrari,

20:27.525 --> 20:30.444
which was outside of Milano,

20:30.445 --> 20:34.645
in the parking lot of a hotel
gas station...

20:36.125 --> 20:37.725
...in Ferrari's camper van.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.804
And I said,
"Why are you meeting him here?

20:41.805 --> 20:45.124
Isn't that odd, you meeting
Ferrari, your doctor, here?"

20:45.125 --> 20:49.564
He said, "So the fucking journalists
don't find out."

20:49.565 --> 20:52.804
And I said, "Well, what's wrong,
if the journalists find out?"

20:52.805 --> 20:55.205
And he just looked at me
and he glared.

20:57.405 --> 21:00.444
Kristin and I had to
waste about an hour

21:00.445 --> 21:03.645
until Lance was done
doing his tests with Ferrari.

21:06.325 --> 21:09.244
When he was finished,
Lance was pretty excited,

21:09.245 --> 21:12.764
and he said,
"My numbers are great."

21:12.765 --> 21:14.164
And then he got in the car,

21:14.165 --> 21:16.924
he looked through his rear view
mirror, he looked at me

21:16.925 --> 21:20.044
and he said, "Frankie could get
results too, but he's too cheap."

21:20.045 --> 21:22.804
He told me a bunch of times,
that I needed to step up,

21:22.805 --> 21:25.764
and I should go see Ferrari.
You know, there's no way.

21:25.765 --> 21:29.124
I just felt like if I was even
linked as going to see Ferrari,

21:29.125 --> 21:31.565
that automatically
meant I was a doper.

21:34.005 --> 21:36.844
The danger about EPO and there
in France was, you know,

21:36.845 --> 21:38.764
there was a big bust
the year before.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.125
Riders and staff went to jail.

21:43.985 --> 21:46.744
<i>French police raided the hotel
rooms of several leading riders</i>

21:46.745 --> 21:48.984
<i>and found stashes of
performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

21:49.485 --> 21:52.764
<i>Another leading rider was missing
from the line-up,</i>

21:52.765 --> 21:54.044
<i>in police custody...</i>

21:54.045 --> 21:57.404
It was the year after the Festina
affair, where a lot of drugs

21:57.405 --> 21:59.044
were caught within a team.

21:59.045 --> 22:01.964
The team couldn't risk taking it
to the race.

22:01.965 --> 22:05.965
You know, we'd lose the sponsor
right away.

22:07.885 --> 22:11.925
To get EPO for the Tour de France,
we came up with a plan.

22:13.245 --> 22:16.044
<i>Well, after last year's sensational
Tour de France,</i>

22:16.045 --> 22:18.124
<i>who knows what we can expect
this time around.</i>

22:18.125 --> 22:23.564
<i>Departure of the man everybody
is talking about, Richard Virenque.</i>

22:23.565 --> 22:25.245
<i>Did you hear that cheer?</i>

22:27.125 --> 22:29.284
The plan had Motor Man involved.

22:29.285 --> 22:32.404
Motor Man was a French...

22:32.405 --> 22:35.124
He used to be a gardener/handyman

22:35.125 --> 22:38.804
for Lance Armstrong.
He loved to ride motorcycles.

22:38.805 --> 22:41.004
<i>Back to Abraham Olano,</i>

22:41.005 --> 22:43.524
<i>I think probably the number one
favourite now.</i>

22:43.525 --> 22:47.284
He would follow the race,
always stay within probably

22:47.285 --> 22:48.924
a half-hour drive from our hotel.

22:48.925 --> 22:51.124
<i>The best finisher of a year ago,
Bobby Julich.</i>

22:51.125 --> 22:53.684
<i>He's based everything on this month,
the Tour de France,</i>

22:53.685 --> 22:55.884
<i>he wants to be the American winner.</i>

22:55.885 --> 22:59.204
<i>But the man doing great times out on
the course, Phil, is Lance Armstrong.</i>

22:59.205 --> 23:02.004
<i>He hasn't been here for a couple
of years because of his illness</i>

23:02.005 --> 23:03.085
<i>but he's back now.</i>

23:04.685 --> 23:07.644
Motor Man would basically just
wait for a phone call.

23:07.645 --> 23:11.564
The EPO would arrive, you know,
in the evening.

23:11.565 --> 23:15.005
<i>He's just about done.
8.18, Chris Boardman.</i>

23:16.765 --> 23:20.844
<i>8 minutes and 12 seconds
for Abraham Olano</i>

23:20.845 --> 23:25.484
<i>8.09, Zulle has rewritten
the finishing order for now.</i>

23:25.485 --> 23:26.964
<i>And Armstrong coming up now,</i>

23:26.965 --> 23:29.364
<i>can he get off to a great
start in the Tour de France?</i>

23:29.365 --> 23:31.684
<i>He is aiming at eight minutes
and nine seconds,</i>

23:31.685 --> 23:34.124
<i>he's certainly
ahead of Chris Boardman</i>

23:34.125 --> 23:36.044
<i>at this point, my goodness me!</i>

23:36.045 --> 23:38.404
<i>8:02.51,
Lance Armstrong,</i>

23:38.405 --> 23:41.845
<i>with that performance, I think
may have done enough.</i>

23:49.845 --> 23:53.685
He knew about it.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.245
Johan Bruyneel knew about it.

24:01.445 --> 24:04.164
You were right there in the heart
of the Tour de France,

24:04.165 --> 24:06.764
you know?

24:06.765 --> 24:10.564
Thousands and thousands
of people around the team camper.

24:10.565 --> 24:13.245
<i>- All the way from Indianapolis!
- No time, sorry.</i>

24:14.445 --> 24:17.284
I remember just trying to get rid
of it as quickly as possible.

24:17.285 --> 24:21.324
You quickly just stuck it in,
got rid of it.

24:21.325 --> 24:24.885
Then it was quickly hidden away,
typically in like, a Coke can.

24:27.245 --> 24:28.764
It was nerve-racking,

24:28.765 --> 24:31.684
but yet, at the time, it was kind
of exciting too,

24:31.685 --> 24:34.285
cos you were being such a deviant.

24:35.845 --> 24:38.004
Sestriere, the first big
mountain day.

24:38.005 --> 24:42.244
<i>Destination's Sestriere, 213 km of
distance...</i>

24:42.245 --> 24:45.244
We had a job to set up Lance,
to keep him as fresh as possible

24:45.245 --> 24:46.964
till that final climb.

24:46.965 --> 24:51.044
<i>US Postal, where the pace-making up
the climb was done by Frankie Andreu.</i>

24:51.045 --> 24:54.324
We had to set the tempo, to be
able to keep things together,

24:54.325 --> 24:56.884
and then riding on the
front like a drag race,

24:56.885 --> 24:59.484
as hard as we could to the bottom
of the climb,

24:59.485 --> 25:02.765
turn and then start riding as hard
as I could, like a field sprint.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.924
When I was watching
the Tour on TV,

25:08.925 --> 25:11.924
I saw Frankie climbing,

25:11.925 --> 25:15.684
leading the pack up
a mountain in Sestriere.

25:15.685 --> 25:17.924
He doesn't specialise in sprinting,

25:17.925 --> 25:20.324
he doesn't specialise
in mountain climbing.

25:20.325 --> 25:23.084
He just specialises in being
the worker bee,

25:23.085 --> 25:28.884
so when Frankie was actually
pulling on Sestriere,

25:28.885 --> 25:31.804
it just didn't make sense.

25:31.805 --> 25:34.924
And so I called a friend of mine
in Paris,

25:34.925 --> 25:38.204
and I said "Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?"

25:38.205 --> 25:41.204
And she said, "Yeah, isn't it great?
Frankie's doing wonderful."

25:41.205 --> 25:44.204
"He's doing so well." And I said,
"Wonderful, my ass.

25:44.205 --> 25:47.044
He's not a climber,
he should not be pulling."

25:47.045 --> 25:50.125
<i>An attack there by Armstrong.</i>

25:52.245 --> 25:55.644
<i>Look at the acceleration of this as
he chases down those motorbikes.</i>

25:55.645 --> 25:58.044
<i>Five and a half hours he's
been pedalling today,</i>

25:58.045 --> 26:00.404
<i>marking everything,
never looking distressed</i>

26:00.405 --> 26:02.764
<i>and now he's going to try
and tear this race apart.</i>

26:02.765 --> 26:05.404
<i>That was an unbelievable attack,
he took a lot of risk to go up</i>

26:05.405 --> 26:08.044
<i>through the inside there. There was
hardly any room at all.</i>

26:08.045 --> 26:10.644
<i>Armstrong is so comfortable,
he jumped across that gap.</i>

26:10.645 --> 26:12.124
<i>That gap was up to 30 seconds.</i>

26:12.125 --> 26:14.844
We're watching the Sestriere stage,
and it was shocking.

26:14.845 --> 26:18.604
It was like, "Oh, my God, he's
dropping riders, dropping climbers."

26:18.605 --> 26:22.284
<i>This man has managed to come back
from the face of death...</i>

26:22.285 --> 26:25.044
One of the mechanics
was right next to me,

26:25.045 --> 26:27.404
and he said, "Il est sur Le jus."

26:27.405 --> 26:30.884
<i>And Armstrong is ripping
the legs off this climber right now.</i>

26:30.885 --> 26:33.164
"Il est sur Le jus."
Like, he's on the juice.

26:33.165 --> 26:36.044
And I'm like, "What?"
He said, "He's on the juice."

26:36.045 --> 26:39.844
<i>He is going faster and faster,
and he is going to win this...</i>

26:39.845 --> 26:41.684
I said, "How do you know?"

26:41.685 --> 26:44.124
He said, "Look at his eyes,
his breathing.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.565
There's no suffering."

26:49.805 --> 26:51.804
It's almost like whatever
they're doing,

26:51.805 --> 26:55.205
they got so much oxygen, it's like
they're not feeling the pain.

27:02.605 --> 27:06.845
He's talking on his radio,
his phone, and it was surreal.

27:10.965 --> 27:15.284
<i>And the rain starts again as Lance
Armstrong conquers Sestriere now.</i>

27:15.285 --> 27:16.884
<i>He heads up towards the line.</i>

27:16.885 --> 27:20.084
<i>Now he's ridden fast and dropped
his rivals, mano-a-mano.</i>

27:20.085 --> 27:22.004
<i>This will be some victory salute.</i>

27:22.005 --> 27:24.564
<i>It will be a while before we know
if it is as the winner</i>

27:24.565 --> 27:27.804
<i>of the Tour de France, but there are
few people in this race now</i>

27:27.805 --> 27:30.804
<i>will doubt that. Lance Armstrong
comes across the line</i>

27:30.805 --> 27:35.165
<i>winner today of the mountain
stage of the Tour de France.</i>

27:38.765 --> 27:41.285
<i>He is really ripping
the race apart.</i>

27:48.965 --> 27:52.284
And so that night after the race
I called Frankie, and I said,

27:52.285 --> 27:54.284
"What in the hell was that?"

27:54.285 --> 27:56.684
And he said, "What was what?"

27:56.685 --> 27:59.004
"What are you doing?
What are you taking?

27:59.005 --> 28:01.285
I don't believe you.
This is bullshit."

28:02.845 --> 28:06.284
There are a lot of secrets,
lot of secrets, lot of...

28:06.285 --> 28:09.124
It was almost like I was
in this just bizarre movie,

28:09.125 --> 28:11.364
some sort of wild western movie.

28:15.525 --> 28:18.085
But something didn't go right.

28:21.245 --> 28:23.644
It was the UCI really who
alerted us.

28:26.845 --> 28:29.284
After winning the prologue,
you're tested.

28:29.285 --> 28:31.484
<i>But then everybody saw you
speaking to the Italians</i>

28:31.485 --> 28:33.404
<i>so is it just
an English language ban?</i>

28:33.405 --> 28:36.284
When Lance was tested for that,
when the results came back,

28:36.285 --> 28:39.684
he had high levels
of corticosteroids in his system.

28:39.685 --> 28:42.364
Cortisone definitely worked.

28:42.365 --> 28:45.564
You know, you could push through
to a whole 'nother level on it,

28:45.565 --> 28:48.924
so over the years, I myself
took cortisone many times -

28:48.925 --> 28:52.124
not for injuries, but for
performance enhancement.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.444
<i>Now you're going to speak...?</i>

28:53.445 --> 28:56.645
<i>- Actually, we were looking for you in there.
- You were? OK.</i>

28:58.045 --> 29:01.244
Lance had asked us to pick up something
from the Spanish doctor in Spain.

29:01.245 --> 29:04.004
<i>What these people need to
remember is that I was</i>

29:04.005 --> 29:07.364
<i>the World Champion in 1993 when
nobody had heard of drugs.</i>

29:07.365 --> 29:10.364
So I went down to Spain,
picked up the product.

29:10.365 --> 29:12.124
That was cloak and dagger.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.244
<i>Nobody had heard of EPO.</i>

29:14.245 --> 29:18.124
Johan, he just kind of passed it
as he's walking by, he just passed

29:18.125 --> 29:21.204
it into my hand and said, "Lovely
day." Just to make sure I had it.

29:21.205 --> 29:24.644
<i>I've proven my class.
I've shown my class, from day one.</i>

29:24.645 --> 29:27.284
Then we were getting back up to
the border to go into France,

29:27.285 --> 29:29.884
there's never a queue at
this border.

29:29.885 --> 29:32.004
There's no secrets here.

29:32.005 --> 29:36.164
There was a queue. I'd seen what
happened after the Festina affair

29:36.165 --> 29:39.924
and I thought, "Oh, God - I could be
one of these that got picked up

29:39.925 --> 29:44.124
last year in the Tour," and I
must have aged about ten years.

29:44.125 --> 29:46.804
<i>We have the oldest secret
in the book - hard work.</i>

29:46.805 --> 29:49.204
So, but luckily enough,
we didn't get stopped.

29:49.205 --> 29:51.804
Came back to France and gave Lance
the little bottle

29:51.805 --> 29:54.565
in the car park of McDonalds
and Frasiers.

29:58.685 --> 30:02.724
We needed to come up with a proper
plan that we're on the same page.

30:02.725 --> 30:05.124
So while I'm giving Lance
his massage,

30:05.125 --> 30:07.884
the others from the team came in.

30:07.885 --> 30:10.404
The problem that had to be sorted
was that Lance

30:10.405 --> 30:13.484
didn't have a prescription
for corticosteroids,

30:13.485 --> 30:17.564
so the idea was then that the doctor
would write a prescription for that,

30:17.565 --> 30:19.484
but backdate it to pre the prologue,

30:19.485 --> 30:23.285
and just pretend it was a cream that
Lance was taking for saddle sores.

30:34.645 --> 30:38.084
And then as we kind of come to the
end of the whole conversation

30:38.085 --> 30:40.244
about steroids, Lance just goes,

30:40.245 --> 30:42.444
"Oh, well, now you know enough
to bring me down."

30:42.445 --> 30:44.284
The next day was the press
conference,

30:44.285 --> 30:46.684
and everything could just blow up
in everybody's faces.

30:46.685 --> 30:49.164
<i>To think I'm going to come back
into sport and risk my life</i>

30:49.165 --> 30:51.124
<i>with performance-enhancing drugs
is crazy.</i>

30:51.125 --> 30:53.604
<i>When I tried to come back to the
sport, nobody gave me a chance.</i>

30:53.605 --> 30:54.804
<i>Nobody gave me a chance.</i>

30:54.805 --> 30:57.564
<i>"So he must be doing something",
so it's the same mentality.</i>

30:57.565 --> 31:00.524
<i>It's the same mentality, it's
consistent through and through.</i>

31:00.525 --> 31:02.804
<i>Tonight, he has some very
high-level help</i>

31:02.805 --> 31:05.404
<i>because the UCI, the world governing
body of cycling,</i>

31:05.405 --> 31:07.404
<i>have just released this press
communique.</i>

31:07.405 --> 31:09.724
<i>They confirm basically that
the rider used an ointment,</i>

31:09.725 --> 31:11.124
<i>and they give the brand name,</i>

31:11.125 --> 31:13.444
<i>and that he also offered them
a medical prescription</i>

31:13.445 --> 31:15.804
<i>before his test.</i>

31:15.805 --> 31:18.924
<i>He comes up to the line -
16 seconds, 15, 14,</i>

31:18.925 --> 31:20.844
<i>it is getting desperately close here.</i>

31:20.845 --> 31:22.124
<i>Zulle versus Armstrong,</i>

31:22.125 --> 31:24.564
<i>and Zulle loses!
Armstrong is the winner,</i>

31:24.565 --> 31:28.524
<i>he has achieved yet another page in
this fairy story</i>

31:28.525 --> 31:31.765
<i>that just goes on.</i>

31:33.045 --> 31:35.364
<i>I'm so proud of my son,
always have been,</i>

31:35.365 --> 31:38.644
<i>and the fact that we overcame
cancer, and we're here today,</i>

31:38.645 --> 31:40.404
<i>in the yellow jersey.</i>

31:40.405 --> 31:45.164
<i>And when you see him tomorrow in the
yellow jersey on the Champs-Elysees?</i>

31:45.165 --> 31:48.085
<i>A picture without words.</i>

31:55.645 --> 31:58.444
<i>...the winner of the Tour de France,
in a big field,</i>

31:58.445 --> 32:01.924
<i>is the American Lance Armstrong,
and what a ride that has been.</i>

32:01.925 --> 32:04.204
<i>It will be remembered
in the millennium</i>

32:04.205 --> 32:07.364
<i>as one of the finest sporting
achievements in the history</i>

32:07.365 --> 32:09.524
<i>of not just cycling, but any sport.</i>

32:09.525 --> 32:14.084
<i>Back in his home state of Texas,
they are celebrating a hero.</i>

32:14.085 --> 32:17.004
<i>The most fantastic feeling,
we're just so proud of him</i>

32:17.005 --> 32:18.524
<i>and this whole team, they just...</i>

32:18.525 --> 32:20.524
<i>It's absolutely incredible and we're</i>

32:20.525 --> 32:22.284
<i>so excited to celebrate tonight</i>

32:22.285 --> 32:24.324
<i>all of us!</i>

32:24.325 --> 32:27.684
We were talking about how our lives
were going to change,

32:27.685 --> 32:31.364
and so I asked the question,

32:31.365 --> 32:34.964
"So, what do you think
about EPO, Kristin?"

32:34.965 --> 32:37.084
"Oh, it's a necessary evil."

32:37.085 --> 32:40.484
And I thought, "Oh, my God,

32:40.485 --> 32:42.884
she doesn't care.

32:42.885 --> 32:44.565
She just doesn't care."

32:47.285 --> 32:49.524
<i>- Smile - say cheese!
- Howdy!</i>

32:49.525 --> 32:54.284
<i>Congratulations, friend, on behalf
of all of us in Texas and America,</i>

32:54.285 --> 32:55.924
<i>we're so proud of you.</i>

32:55.925 --> 33:00.604
<i>He went up and he went up.
Lance is on the wheel.</i>

33:00.605 --> 33:02.564
<i>There's Tyler.</i>

33:02.565 --> 33:04.524
<i>Take it easy on camera.</i>

33:04.525 --> 33:07.484
<i>- Luis!
- How are you? Are you tired today?</i>

33:07.485 --> 33:10.404
<i>No. Be well.</i>

33:10.405 --> 33:14.924
<i>Carmichael and Stapleton,
unbelievable. They're so serious.</i>

33:14.925 --> 33:18.484
<i>The man, the myth - Johan Bruyneel.</i>

33:18.485 --> 33:20.765
<i>- Say hello to my family.
- Hi, family!</i>

33:22.725 --> 33:24.124
<i>In Texas, all eyes were on</i>

33:24.125 --> 33:26.724
<i>American Tour de France winner
Lance Armstrong.</i>

33:26.725 --> 33:29.164
<i>A parade was held in his honour
in Austin,</i>

33:29.165 --> 33:31.284
<i>Armstrong's adopted hometown.</i>

33:31.285 --> 33:34.365
<i>Many people wore yellow, the colour
of the winner's jersey...</i>

33:41.045 --> 33:43.444
<i>...proclaim July 29 in the city
of New York as</i>

33:43.445 --> 33:45.445
<i>Lance Armstrong Day.</i>

33:47.525 --> 33:50.004
<i>...Cycling's biggest prize,
the Tour de France,</i>

33:50.005 --> 33:52.764
<i>the first American winner to lead
an American team,</i>

33:52.765 --> 33:54.845
<i>and in record time at that.</i>

33:58.885 --> 34:01.924
<i>Nobody believed in us,
nobody believed that</i>

34:01.925 --> 34:04.804
<i>if Lance Armstrong took the yellow
jersey, with the help of his team,</i>

34:04.805 --> 34:07.124
<i>on stage eight, how could
they keep it to stage 22?</i>

34:07.125 --> 34:08.884
<i>They thought the team would crack.</i>

34:08.885 --> 34:11.404
<i>But that team of seven out of nine
guys being American,</i>

34:11.405 --> 34:13.164
<i>an American team,
an American sponsor,</i>

34:13.165 --> 34:15.524
<i>they were the strongest
team in the race.</i>

34:15.525 --> 34:17.643
<i>And everybody in Paris knew that.</i>

34:17.645 --> 34:21.324
<i>And I can assure you that next
year's Tour de France,</i>

34:21.324 --> 34:24.485
<i>there will be no,
there'll be no doubters.</i>

34:29.885 --> 34:33.444
<i>Welcome to Futuroscope
on the outskirts of Poitiers,</i>

34:33.445 --> 34:36.284
<i>and to the 87th running
of the Tour de France.</i>

34:36.284 --> 34:41.043
All of a sudden they're talking
about this EPO test coming out.

34:46.005 --> 34:50.083
We didn't know exactly when it was
coming out, but no longer

34:50.085 --> 34:52.565
could you feel 100% safe.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.444
You take a shot of EPO,
you know,

34:56.445 --> 34:59.444
you can get tested the next day
or the day after that.

34:59.445 --> 35:02.245
We weren't 100% sure we were going
to test negative.

35:04.325 --> 35:07.125
So that's when
we did a blood transfusion.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.284
Who was organising all of that?

35:13.285 --> 35:18.124
Lance and Johan Bruyneel,
and the doctor, Del Moral,

35:18.125 --> 35:23.564
had told me a couple of days before
we made a trip down to Spain.

35:23.565 --> 35:27.444
You know, my first time doing it.

35:27.445 --> 35:31.244
And it seemed kind of,
sort of caveman-like.

35:31.245 --> 35:33.564
You know, taking out your own blood,

35:33.565 --> 35:35.965
not seeing it
for three or four weeks.

35:39.725 --> 35:43.564
<i>Weather conditions out here really
have been atrocious.</i>

35:43.565 --> 35:46.124
<i>It's only around about six or seven
degrees Celsius...</i>

35:46.125 --> 35:50.804
The night before our first rest day,
we were in this small hotel,

35:50.805 --> 35:55.324
just south of Mont Ventoux,
which is a famous climb in France.

35:55.325 --> 35:57.884
20 minutes before
it actually happened,

35:57.885 --> 36:00.524
they told me, "We're doing
the transfusion."

36:00.525 --> 36:03.485
Re-infuse the blood, tonight.

36:08.445 --> 36:11.564
I arrived in my room
and it was pretty wild.

36:11.565 --> 36:14.604
The staff had sort of prepared
everything, the doctors.

36:14.605 --> 36:18.044
There was a blood bag taped up
on the wall.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.124
You know,
a red tube coming down,

36:20.125 --> 36:22.924
a tube filled with blood
coming down.

36:22.925 --> 36:27.564
Basically, they, you know,
injected me here.

36:27.565 --> 36:30.004
I have pretty small veins,

36:30.005 --> 36:33.124
so the one place that always
worked was right there.

36:33.125 --> 36:36.484
And it's, you can see
the scars today...

36:36.485 --> 36:39.004
It was a big needle.
It's a serious needle.

36:39.005 --> 36:41.245
You don't mess around
with those things.

36:42.445 --> 36:45.484
Halfway through it,
I'm like, almost shivering,

36:45.485 --> 36:48.924
because, you know, these bags have
been, you know, in a refrigerator.

36:48.925 --> 36:51.564
So they're almost like, you know,
just taking icy cold water,

36:51.565 --> 36:54.525
nearly a gallon of it,
and pouring it down your throat.

36:56.725 --> 36:59.084
I never did, you know,
blood transfusions,

36:59.085 --> 37:01.444
growth hormone, whatever.

37:01.445 --> 37:05.004
I wasn't willing to get
into a full doping programme.

37:05.005 --> 37:08.764
Betsy was upset, so that was
definitely on my mind.

37:08.765 --> 37:11.485
A little bit of being scared
of getting caught.

37:13.525 --> 37:14.924
<i>Here is the Devil,</i>

37:14.925 --> 37:17.884
<i>probably wishing some luck to
the US Postal riders today...</i>

37:17.885 --> 37:21.604
I think we were all pretty nervous,
but almost giddy about it.

37:21.605 --> 37:26.284
We're in the heart of France doing
this completely illegal procedure.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.924
<i>US Postal were pace-making
by Frankie Andreu,</i>

37:28.925 --> 37:30.564
<i>but he paid the price.</i>

37:32.065 --> 37:34.184
I remember, the third week
I was dead.

37:34.185 --> 37:37.784
I mean, barely able to get through
it, and just, you know,

37:37.985 --> 37:39.804
it's not an option to quit. That's
the only reason I got through it,

37:40.005 --> 37:43.964
but I was getting dropped and in
the back, and I was suffering a lot.

37:44.565 --> 37:48.244
<i>I think he'll just about get in
but he's aiming at the time</i>

37:48.245 --> 37:52.044
<i>of 15.27. We're watching probably
the second-fastest time trial</i>

37:52.545 --> 37:54.064
<i>in the history of the
Tour de France...</i>

37:54.065 --> 37:55.284
I had done a lot to help
Lance Armstrong,

37:55.585 --> 37:57.224
I had done a lot to help the team,

37:57.425 --> 38:00.384
and I just wanted to race one more year,
but they had different thoughts.

38:00.385 --> 38:02.984
<i>Armstrong rocks and rolls his way
home here now.</i>

38:02.985 --> 38:07.664
<i>His time is 15.01,
he wins the time trial.</i>

38:07.665 --> 38:10.024
<i>Fantastic. I will definitely
come back.</i>

38:10.025 --> 38:11.944
<i>I will definitely be back
next year.</i>

38:11.945 --> 38:14.744
<i>I don't know how many more years,
but definitely be back next year.</i>

38:14.745 --> 38:17.384
He finished 111th,
but on Lance's team,

38:17.385 --> 38:22.185
it doesn't pay to finish 111th
when you're at the Tour.

38:24.305 --> 38:27.104
<i>I would say, Johan, thanks for giving
us the vision,</i>

38:27.105 --> 38:30.225
<i>but we already had the vision, so...</i>

38:34.185 --> 38:37.704
Here we are at this Tour de France
party with hundreds of people

38:37.705 --> 38:41.344
and everybody is celebrating
the cancer survivor's

38:41.345 --> 38:45.104
incredible win at the most gruelling
sporting event in the world.

38:45.105 --> 38:47.504
What wasn't there to celebrate?

38:47.505 --> 38:52.065
It was a fraud.

39:02.505 --> 39:06.344
Stephanie McIlvain wasn't invited
to the Tour De France party,

39:06.345 --> 39:08.184
which we found very peculiar

39:08.185 --> 39:11.024
given that she was Lance's
personal liaison,

39:11.025 --> 39:16.065
so she went as our guest and we
clicked and a friendship was born.

39:16.945 --> 39:21.664
Stephanie had been there with us
visiting Lance in Indiana,

39:21.665 --> 39:24.304
and the hospital incident came up,

39:24.305 --> 39:28.104
and Stephanie
and I were marvelling at how

39:28.105 --> 39:32.544
Lance was snowballing
the American media,

39:32.545 --> 39:35.865
because they were just
buying into this fairy tale.

39:40.865 --> 39:43.904
It seemed like it worked,
seemed like it worked.

39:43.905 --> 39:47.464
Now, looking back,
"Oh, my God, what was I doing?"

39:47.465 --> 39:51.864
But you're so deep into it, you
know, you don't even have time

39:51.865 --> 39:55.864
to take a half step back
and look at the big picture.

39:55.865 --> 39:57.544
I think if we all stepped back

39:57.545 --> 40:01.184
and looked at the great franchises
that have been built...

40:01.185 --> 40:03.744
I'm glad we didn't get caught.

40:03.745 --> 40:05.424
I would have been...

40:05.425 --> 40:07.785
We all would have been.

40:16.345 --> 40:17.784
It became very divided.

40:17.785 --> 40:20.224
You were on Lance's side
or you were on my side.

40:20.225 --> 40:22.784
And ultimately, you know,
he had control of who was hired,

40:22.785 --> 40:24.025
fired, and whichever.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.704
Frankie was a good guy.

40:29.705 --> 40:31.264
To have your career end

40:31.265 --> 40:34.224
because you wouldn't get
on Lance's doping programme?

40:34.225 --> 40:36.384
It's just, it's not right.

40:36.385 --> 40:41.024
<i>Please welcome 1999's ESPY comeback
athlete of the year...</i>

40:41.025 --> 40:44.064
<i>We're all in this together,
it's going to touch all our lives.</i>

40:44.065 --> 40:47.184
<i>We will win this fight one day.</i>

40:47.185 --> 40:50.024
Lance called me one day

40:50.025 --> 40:52.784
and said, "We're putting together
this foundation.

40:52.785 --> 40:55.585
We're going to focus
on testicular cancer."

40:58.185 --> 41:02.225
<i>Tour de France, baby.
Lance Armstrong. Maillot jaune.</i>

41:04.625 --> 41:09.984
<i>Thank you, Lance, thank you!
I love you!</i>

41:09.985 --> 41:13.304
People believed in Lance.
They believed in his story,

41:13.305 --> 41:15.024
they believed in his hope.

41:15.025 --> 41:16.584
We're all going to leave, I think,

41:16.585 --> 41:19.104
with a different perspective
on this illness,

41:19.105 --> 41:22.304
and a different perspective on this
movement called survivorship.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.464
<i>I tip my hat to Lance Armstrong</i>

41:24.465 --> 41:26.345
<i>and to the whole US Postal Team.</i>

41:30.825 --> 41:34.824
The success of the foundation began
to grow and succeed,

41:34.825 --> 41:39.024
literally in tandem
with Lance's success.

41:39.025 --> 41:41.184
Tour after Tour after Tour.

41:41.185 --> 41:44.424
<i>$15,000. Can we go 20?</i>

41:44.425 --> 41:45.825
<i>Sold, $30,000.</i>

41:47.785 --> 41:52.344
They approached me about exploring
the possibility of coming down

41:52.345 --> 41:54.344
and running the foundation.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.904
<i>Sold, $56,000.</i>

41:55.905 --> 41:59.184
My motivation,
my primary motivation,

41:59.185 --> 42:01.344
in taking that position,

42:01.345 --> 42:04.144
was the fact that I had,

42:04.145 --> 42:05.944
um...

42:05.945 --> 42:09.184
a very personal experience.

42:09.185 --> 42:12.144
I had been diagnosed with cancer.

42:12.145 --> 42:15.464
We believe in life, your life.

42:15.465 --> 42:18.824
Greg LeMond was my friend,
and I called him.

42:18.825 --> 42:20.384
And I begged him.

42:20.385 --> 42:23.144
I said, "Steve, you won't make it."

42:23.145 --> 42:27.664
I said, "You are way too ethical.
I'm just telling you, don't do it."

42:27.665 --> 42:31.305
But I needed to talk to Lance.

42:32.305 --> 42:36.344
We met at a bar and I said,

42:36.345 --> 42:39.464
"Is there ANYTHING that might happen

42:39.465 --> 42:43.304
that would negatively impact

42:43.305 --> 42:47.344
the work of the foundation
and me professionally?"

42:47.345 --> 42:50.785
And he put his beer down
and looked me in the eye...

42:52.545 --> 42:55.704
...and said, "Steve, you have NOTHING
to worry about.

42:55.705 --> 42:57.464
We're going to have a good
ride on this.

42:57.465 --> 42:59.025
This is going to be great."

43:01.225 --> 43:03.024
<i>And there is Armstrong.</i>

43:03.025 --> 43:05.984
<i>He's not looking good, he's all over
his machine right now.</i>

43:05.985 --> 43:09.064
<i>He doesn't look good, Phil. He should
not be riding so far down the group.</i>

43:09.065 --> 43:11.984
<i>He's obviously having
a very hard day.</i>

43:11.985 --> 43:14.704
<i>This is where you have to race alone
and Armstrong's gone.</i>

43:14.705 --> 43:16.064
<i>A big move by Lance, this</i>

43:16.065 --> 43:18.824
<i>and no reply coming at all
from Jan Ullrich.</i>

43:18.825 --> 43:21.024
<i>Ullrich has got
no answer to this.</i>

43:21.025 --> 43:23.464
<i>He's fooled everybody
in the Tour de France.</i>

43:23.465 --> 43:25.744
<i>I never expected
Armstrong to do this.</i>

43:25.745 --> 43:29.064
<i>He has ripped the field apart
and he is climbing now to the...</i>

43:29.065 --> 43:31.624
<i>...and he was riding to win the Tour
de France.</i>

43:31.625 --> 43:33.664
<i>Now are we seeing the foundations</i>

43:33.665 --> 43:37.344
<i>of the man who will win the Tour
for the third time in Paris?</i>

43:37.345 --> 43:40.305
<i>"Yes, that's the one I wanted
and I've got it."</i>

43:42.185 --> 43:44.584
I had been convinced for some time

43:44.585 --> 43:46.944
that Armstrong worked
with Michele Ferrari.

43:50.625 --> 43:53.024
I got the Italian police
to help me.

43:53.025 --> 43:55.384
They got me evidence that Lance,

43:55.385 --> 43:59.464
in the space of two years, spent 13
days in the town of Ferrara

43:59.465 --> 44:01.824
and the only reason,
if you were Lance Armstrong,

44:01.825 --> 44:04.905
for being in Ferrara, was to see
this doping doctor.

44:12.465 --> 44:16.064
He had to do a press conference
on the rest day in Pau.

44:16.065 --> 44:17.424
<i>I think this is a clean tour.</i>

44:17.425 --> 44:20.384
And in that press conference,
16 questions go,

44:20.385 --> 44:22.744
no questions about doping
and then bang,

44:22.745 --> 44:24.584
first question is asked

44:24.585 --> 44:26.904
and the doping questions
then come like a,

44:26.905 --> 44:28.544
like in an avalanche.

44:28.545 --> 44:31.424
And as soon as the question
turned to doping,

44:31.425 --> 44:33.664
Lance did something quite strange.

44:33.665 --> 44:35.024
<i>I believe he's an honest man,</i>

44:35.025 --> 44:37.744
<i>I believe he's a fair man
and I believe he's an innocent man.</i>

44:37.745 --> 44:40.824
He started fixing his gaze on me.

44:40.825 --> 44:44.504
And even though it was some journalist
over here who asked the question,

44:44.505 --> 44:46.584
Lance would refer to me
in his answer.

44:46.585 --> 44:50.224
<i>I've never denied the relationship.
Even to you.</i>

44:50.225 --> 44:52.065
<i>Um...</i>

44:53.745 --> 44:55.304
<i>People are not stupid.</i>

44:55.305 --> 44:59.384
<i>They say, "Has Lance Armstrong
ever tested positive?" No.</i>

44:59.385 --> 45:01.824
<i>"Has Lance Armstrong been tested?"
A lot.</i>

45:01.825 --> 45:05.064
But I found that
just wholly unconvincing.

45:07.505 --> 45:10.304
Two weeks later,
David Walsh called up

45:10.305 --> 45:12.584
and I'm like, "God, I,
I don't know what to say."

45:12.585 --> 45:15.464
So I chose my words
as well as I could

45:15.465 --> 45:18.904
and I just said, "I'm disappointed
he's seeing Ferrari."

45:18.905 --> 45:21.224
And then David posed
the question, now,

45:21.225 --> 45:24.504
"If he's clean, would you consider
this the greatest comeback

45:24.505 --> 45:27.384
in the history of sport?"
And I said, "Absolutely."

45:27.385 --> 45:30.264
And he said, "but what if he isn't?"

45:30.265 --> 45:32.825
I said, "Then it would be
the greatest fraud."

45:35.945 --> 45:38.144
After that comment came out,

45:38.145 --> 45:40.784
our whole lives changed in an hour

45:40.785 --> 45:43.025
after that was published.

45:44.385 --> 45:46.144
We went out to dinner

45:46.145 --> 45:49.264
and Lance, he said,
"Fucking LeMond.

45:49.265 --> 45:50.344
His comments about Ferrari,

45:50.345 --> 45:53.024
and how he's disappointed
that I'm working with Ferrari."

45:53.025 --> 45:56.064
Lance flipped. You know, and at that
dinner it was vent session.

45:56.065 --> 45:58.464
"Who does Greg think he is?
I'm going to destroy him",

45:58.465 --> 46:00.024
all this kind of stuff.

46:00.025 --> 46:03.144
And I said, "Yeah,
but I thought Ferrari's a BAD guy."

46:03.145 --> 46:05.425
And he just looked at me
and he glared.

46:07.785 --> 46:11.065
And he said,
"I'm going to fuck him over."

46:18.705 --> 46:21.184
Lance returned to the US.

46:21.185 --> 46:24.264
He was scheduled to throw

46:24.265 --> 46:27.584
the opening game baseball
at Yankee Stadium.

46:27.585 --> 46:31.144
And he was sitting in his hotel room
at the Four Seasons.

46:31.145 --> 46:32.665
He calls Greg LeMond.

46:36.385 --> 46:38.144
We were at bag claim,

46:38.145 --> 46:41.344
Minneapolis airport,
I had pulled up outside...

46:41.345 --> 46:43.984
...and the phone rang

46:43.985 --> 46:46.024
and Greg says, "It's Lance."

46:46.025 --> 46:47.464
He said, "Oh, come on,

46:47.465 --> 46:49.944
your win in '89 was a miracle,
just like mine,

46:49.945 --> 46:52.145
in '99", I said, whoa...

46:53.385 --> 46:56.384
That's where you're wrong, buddy,
cos mine wasn't a miracle.

46:56.385 --> 46:59.264
I worked my ass off,
I barely won by eight seconds.

46:59.265 --> 47:01.904
- No miracle there.
- ...<i>by eight seconds.</i>

47:01.905 --> 47:05.704
He said to Greg, "You're telling me
YOU never did EPO?"

47:05.705 --> 47:08.944
Absolutely not. "Oh, come on -
everybody takes EPO."

47:08.945 --> 47:11.424
And he mentioned drugs that I

47:11.425 --> 47:15.904
never heard of.
Hemasist, er, Hemopure, PFC's.

47:15.905 --> 47:18.544
He listed probably ten drugs
I'd never heard of.

47:18.545 --> 47:21.264
"Is that what you think I'm on?"
I'm like, whoa, um...

47:21.265 --> 47:24.584
You know, he was VICIOUS.

47:24.585 --> 47:27.904
He said, "Well, if you want to throw
stones, I'll throw stones."

47:27.905 --> 47:31.704
And he said, "I'll get people, I'll get ten
people to say you took EPO."

47:31.705 --> 47:33.144
Holy shit.

47:33.145 --> 47:34.504
And Greg...

47:34.505 --> 47:38.664
just said, "I'm sorry, but if
anybody comes out saying I used EPO,

47:38.665 --> 47:40.824
I'm going to know it came from you

47:40.825 --> 47:42.184
and you paid 'em."

47:44.465 --> 47:47.384
Cos I know that Steve was working
at Lance Armstrong Foundation,

47:47.385 --> 47:50.224
I called him just to say, you know,
"This is what happened to me."

47:50.225 --> 47:52.144
<i>This is Greg LeMond calling.</i>

47:52.145 --> 47:53.944
He was clearly shaken.

47:53.945 --> 47:58.064
And he proceeds over the course
of 45 minutes to an hour

47:58.065 --> 48:01.584
telling me exactly what had just
transpired.

48:01.585 --> 48:03.824
Including the threat.

48:03.825 --> 48:06.664
The next day, I get
a call from Lance.

48:06.665 --> 48:10.104
And he proceeds to tell

48:10.105 --> 48:12.385
of his conversation with Greg.

48:13.825 --> 48:17.024
He was out of control,
he was clearly drunk.

48:17.025 --> 48:18.464
We've gotten reports back

48:18.465 --> 48:22.304
that, "Oh, yeah, Greg had
a drug and alcohol problem."

48:22.305 --> 48:25.544
I actually had a reporter
call and ask me one day,

48:25.545 --> 48:27.744
if Greg had a heroin problem.

48:27.745 --> 48:29.664
What was interesting

48:29.665 --> 48:34.984
is Lance's version was completely
different than Greg's version

48:34.985 --> 48:39.184
and it was certainly at that
moment in time I thought...

48:42.505 --> 48:44.585
I have been made a fool of.

48:53.785 --> 48:59.864
I packed my car and I drove
out of Texas

48:59.865 --> 49:02.064
and the next day I resigned.

49:02.065 --> 49:04.424
<i>Absolutely, I had to learn
a lot about the illness</i>

49:04.425 --> 49:06.784
<i>and I had to learn
a lot about my options.</i>

49:06.785 --> 49:09.624
<i>Mm-hm. Did you ever consider
the option of giving up?</i>

49:09.625 --> 49:10.984
<i>Oh, no.</i>

49:10.985 --> 49:14.064
<i>That's great. That's great.</i>

49:14.065 --> 49:16.144
<i>Because it's not an option, is it?</i>

49:16.145 --> 49:17.705
<i>It's just not an option.</i>

49:26.345 --> 49:28.344
Tyler Hamilton left the team,

49:28.345 --> 49:31.064
because Tyler was incredibly
ambitious

49:31.065 --> 49:34.024
and he was resentful
of Lance's profile.

49:34.025 --> 49:38.704
He was a... absolutely driven guy,
a bit like Lance,

49:38.705 --> 49:43.064
had to win and Tyler thought the
only way that I can win the Tour

49:43.065 --> 49:44.744
is to be in another team

49:44.745 --> 49:47.504
and when I go and leave this team

49:47.505 --> 49:49.704
I then am going to get a doping
programme

49:49.705 --> 49:53.544
- just as good, if not better than Lance's.
- <i>One, two...</i>

49:53.545 --> 49:56.984
There became more stresses,
you know, having to

49:56.985 --> 49:59.984
work with my own
special doctor there in Spain,

49:59.985 --> 50:01.944
having to organise those trips.

50:01.945 --> 50:04.744
It wasn't the team handling it.

50:04.745 --> 50:07.344
The easy part about the US Postal
Service cycling team

50:07.345 --> 50:11.224
for me in terms of doping was it
was all kind of taken care of,

50:11.225 --> 50:13.104
like, one-stop shopping.

50:13.105 --> 50:15.184
<i>Stuart O'Grady has moved
too far back</i>

50:15.185 --> 50:18.104
<i>and there's been a mass pile-up
there, it was Tyler went down,</i>

50:18.105 --> 50:20.744
<i>and the peloton completely
crashing on the line.</i>

50:20.745 --> 50:24.184
And if Tyler Hamilton left the team,
Lance needed

50:24.185 --> 50:27.584
a young American guy, preferably,
to take Tyler's place.

50:27.585 --> 50:29.584
Floyd was the obvious example.

50:29.585 --> 50:32.504
He was talented,
he was gritty, he was tough

50:32.505 --> 50:36.224
and he's saying to Johan,
I'll do whatever it takes.

50:36.225 --> 50:39.824
<i>We have to make sure that we're not in
a situation like Pyrenees, for example.</i>

50:39.825 --> 50:41.624
<i>Floyd will remember that very well.
Floyd.</i>

50:41.625 --> 50:45.024
<i>Thanks for pointing that out, yes.
I won't forget that any time soon.</i>

50:45.025 --> 50:47.424
<i>You're 27 seconds faster than...</i>

50:47.425 --> 50:49.984
<i>...and 40 seconds faster than...</i>

50:49.985 --> 50:52.984
<i>Boys, come on, keep it together.
We're going to win it.</i>

50:52.985 --> 50:56.064
There was a train here
and it was dripping with gravy.

50:56.065 --> 50:57.904
<i>Here they are, a blue train.</i>

50:57.905 --> 51:00.664
And these guys were desperate to mop
up as much as they could

51:00.665 --> 51:02.064
for themselves.

51:02.065 --> 51:04.024
Because the financial
rewards were huge.

51:04.025 --> 51:06.424
<i>OK, OK, OK, OK!</i>

51:06.425 --> 51:09.584
<i>This is the best team in the world
right now.</i>

51:09.585 --> 51:12.864
I saw what I deemed a huge fraud

51:12.865 --> 51:16.544
being played out on a world stage

51:16.545 --> 51:18.384
and there was no place,

51:18.385 --> 51:19.624
no place to turn.

51:22.105 --> 51:24.504
Journalists approached me

51:24.505 --> 51:27.144
and some of them had got questions
they'd e-mailed me across

51:27.145 --> 51:30.664
and stuff were very close
to what was going on.

51:30.665 --> 51:32.944
All the peloton
were on Armstrong's side.

51:32.945 --> 51:35.264
The sponsors are
on Armstrong's side.

51:35.265 --> 51:37.265
The UCI were on Armstrong's side.

51:38.545 --> 51:42.064
Everybody had a stake
in Lance being a success.

51:42.065 --> 51:45.024
And of course anybody who
accused him

51:45.025 --> 51:48.144
was deemed an enemy of the sport.

51:48.145 --> 51:50.104
<i>London sports writer,
David Walsh</i>

51:50.105 --> 51:53.504
<i>accuses Armstrong of doping
in the book, LA Confidential.</i>

51:53.505 --> 51:55.344
<i>The book, published only in France,</i>

51:55.345 --> 51:58.024
<i>quotes Armstrong's former
massage therapist,</i>

51:58.025 --> 52:00.864
<i>who claims she covered up
injection marks with make up.</i>

52:00.865 --> 52:03.984
I remember I was sweeping
my sitting room floor,

52:03.985 --> 52:05.744
Sky Sports is on.

52:05.745 --> 52:09.064
In the corner of my eye I can see
the ticker tape underneath it go,

52:09.065 --> 52:14.224
and it says, "Former Armstrong
masseuse, Emma O'Reilly...

52:14.225 --> 52:17.584
spills the beans", blah, blah,
blah. I'm thinking...

52:17.585 --> 52:21.744
I have to say my first thought was, I am
going to get David Walsh and wring his neck.

52:21.745 --> 52:23.584
<i>I'll say one thing about the book</i>

52:23.585 --> 52:26.664
<i>and especially since
our esteemed author is here...</i>

52:26.665 --> 52:30.904
<i>In my view, I think extraordinary
accusations</i>

52:30.905 --> 52:33.704
<i>must be followed up</i>

52:33.705 --> 52:35.864
<i>with extraordinary proof.</i>

52:35.865 --> 52:38.944
<i>And they have not come up with
extraordinary proof.</i>

52:38.945 --> 52:41.104
Why couldn't it just be proof,

52:41.105 --> 52:44.745
that allegations must
be followed up by proof?

52:46.145 --> 52:49.585
And what Lance was saying
is that, when you're an icon...

52:51.265 --> 52:54.264
...who sits as high
in the firmament as I do,

52:54.265 --> 52:58.224
you have to have extraordinary proof
to bring ME down.

52:58.225 --> 53:01.264
And it was true.
What he was saying was right.

53:01.265 --> 53:04.544
Different rules apply to the gods.

53:04.545 --> 53:05.865
And I am a god.

53:07.545 --> 53:09.944
Mr. Armstrong's legal team

53:09.945 --> 53:11.824
was very concerned
about the book

53:11.825 --> 53:14.544
and wanted to discredit David Walsh.

53:14.545 --> 53:17.864
They knew one of the sources
was likely Betsy Andreu

53:17.865 --> 53:20.424
and they wanted Betsy Andreu
and Frankie Andreu

53:20.425 --> 53:24.024
to distance themselves from the book
and say Mr. Walsh had it wrong.

53:24.025 --> 53:27.744
Lance told me that his two,
his two agents,

53:27.745 --> 53:30.624
Bill Stapleton and
Bart Knaggs wanted to talk with me.

53:30.625 --> 53:31.944
So I was like, OK.

53:31.945 --> 53:34.824
You know, I knew what was coming, I
knew what it was going to be about.

53:34.825 --> 53:37.344
He asked me, he said,
"Shall I tape the conversation?"

53:37.345 --> 53:39.985
I said, "Hell, yeah, because
they'll say it never happened."

53:42.945 --> 53:46.544
We met in the parking lot
of the Tour de France start

53:46.545 --> 53:49.544
after everybody had, you know,
all the riders had left and so,

53:49.545 --> 53:52.185
I put a tape recorder in my pocket
and I tape recorded everything.

54:02.745 --> 54:04.744
Cos I didn't trust
these guys, you know.

54:04.745 --> 54:06.784
Still don't trust them.

54:06.785 --> 54:09.264
They talked about how bad it would
be for the sport

54:09.265 --> 54:12.665
if Lance gets in trouble
and all this comes out.

54:17.945 --> 54:20.184
They wanted her to sign an affidavit

54:20.185 --> 54:24.425
saying she would never go against Lance Armstrong
for the rest of her life. Something crazy.

54:41.625 --> 54:43.984
You can imagine
when I brought that up to Betsy,

54:43.985 --> 54:46.264
"So, Bets, they want you to, er,
sign something

54:46.265 --> 54:49.104
"saying you'll never sue or go
against Lance Armstrong," and it was,

54:49.105 --> 54:50.704
it was just a bunch of cuss words.

54:50.705 --> 54:54.065
Yeah! Because I saw what they were
doing. It was ridiculous.

54:55.545 --> 54:58.184
OK, first of all Frankie
loses his job

54:58.185 --> 55:01.505
because he won't get
on a doping programme and now...

55:02.945 --> 55:07.504
...they are trying to get me
to sign something

55:07.505 --> 55:09.384
to support Lance?

55:09.385 --> 55:12.424
Whom I believe is cheating?
It's not going to happen.

55:12.425 --> 55:16.624
<i>There's no argument who the
champion is of the Tour de France.</i>

55:16.625 --> 55:18.664
And when I refused...

55:18.665 --> 55:21.104
<i>It's been four times now,
how do you differentiate...</i>

55:21.105 --> 55:23.264
It just was not good
for Frankie's career.

55:23.265 --> 55:25.024
<i>Thank you, Lance. Thank you.</i>

55:25.025 --> 55:27.944
<i>The yellow jersey
is owned by only one man,</i>

55:27.945 --> 55:30.744
<i>as it has been for the last
eight days.</i>

55:30.745 --> 55:34.944
Lance Armstrong benefited from SCA
and Bob Hammond paying

55:34.945 --> 55:37.304
an enormous
amount of prize money for him,

55:37.305 --> 55:41.584
winning races that Lance
Armstrong swore he won cleanly.

55:41.585 --> 55:44.304
...as he races the line
to the victory...

55:44.305 --> 55:47.984
Total amount to Lance if he won all
of the Tour de France races

55:47.985 --> 55:49.544
came close to almost $10 million.

55:49.545 --> 55:51.784
<i>Lance, well done.
Back for more next year?</i>

55:51.785 --> 55:53.944
<i>Ha, ha. Probably.</i>

55:53.945 --> 55:58.104
When somebody consistently
goes against the odds,

55:58.105 --> 56:00.024
the evidence is that perhaps

56:00.025 --> 56:02.064
the odds aren't
what you think they are

56:02.065 --> 56:04.824
and something else is present

56:04.825 --> 56:06.624
and quite often that's cheating.

56:08.225 --> 56:11.224
<i>He is down the ramp for
the last time in his career.</i>

56:11.225 --> 56:14.864
<i>I've decided that the Tour de France
will be my last race</i>

56:14.865 --> 56:16.184
<i>as a professional cyclist.</i>

56:16.185 --> 56:19.704
<i>It is the picture
we will never see again.</i>

56:19.705 --> 56:23.104
<i>A rider in yellow
we've come to know since 1999.</i>

56:23.105 --> 56:25.464
<i>You won't believe what the
crowd are doing here.</i>

56:25.465 --> 56:28.104
<i>They are leaping in every direction</i>

56:28.105 --> 56:31.424
<i>as Lance Armstrong brings it to
an end as a winner.</i>

56:31.425 --> 56:33.584
<i>History in the making,
he now retires</i>

56:33.585 --> 56:36.024
<i>seven times a winner
of the Tour De France.</i>

56:36.025 --> 56:38.504
<i>Lance Armstrong!</i>

56:38.505 --> 56:40.304
<i>The last thing I'll say
for the people</i>

56:40.305 --> 56:41.824
<i>that don't believe in cycling,</i>

56:41.825 --> 56:44.144
<i>the cynics and the skeptics,</i>

56:44.145 --> 56:45.624
<i>I'm sorry for you,</i>

56:45.625 --> 56:47.264
<i>I'm sorry you can't dream big,</i>

56:47.265 --> 56:49.424
<i>and I'm sorry you don't
believe in miracles,</i>

56:49.425 --> 56:50.824
<i>but this is one hell of a race.</i>

56:50.825 --> 56:53.464
<i>This is a great sporting event
and you should believe.</i>

56:53.465 --> 56:55.144
<i>And, er...</i>

56:55.145 --> 56:58.344
<i>Vive La Tour. For ever. Thank you.</i>

57:07.945 --> 57:10.824
<i>Good morning, this begins
video tape number one,</i>

57:10.825 --> 57:14.264
<i>in the arbitration matter
of Lance Armstrong et Al</i>

57:14.265 --> 57:17.544
<i>versus SCA Promotions
Incorporated et Al.</i>

57:17.545 --> 57:21.184
Bob Hamman kind of basically felt
that he'd been duped,

57:21.185 --> 57:25.024
he'd already paid Lance, I think four
and a half million at that time,

57:25.025 --> 57:27.944
he baulked at paying the
last $5 million bonus.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.464
<i>Mr. Armstrong, my name
is Jeff Tillotson, I represent...</i>

57:30.465 --> 57:34.664
It became a law suit and over the
course of about a year and a half,

57:34.665 --> 57:37.104
we took depositions,
which is sworn testimony,

57:37.105 --> 57:39.184
we ploughed through records.

57:42.345 --> 57:45.864
The day before the SCA deposition,
I received a phone call from him.

57:45.865 --> 57:47.984
"Just calling to see
how you're doing."

57:47.985 --> 57:50.544
I hadn't talked to the guy in like,
four years, you know

57:50.545 --> 57:53.304
and saying, "Ah, you know
I heard this is,

57:53.305 --> 57:55.424
Kathy LeMond said this,
that Betsy said this."

57:55.425 --> 57:57.904
He was prying for information
and questions

57:57.905 --> 58:01.184
and trying to say, "Hey, I'm here."

58:01.185 --> 58:02.944
I'm right at your door.

58:02.945 --> 58:05.264
And then he showed up
at the door step.

58:05.265 --> 58:07.384
So when I showed up,

58:07.385 --> 58:10.504
I saw Lance walking in the hallway

58:10.505 --> 58:12.704
and I thought, "Oh, my gosh."

58:12.705 --> 58:15.384
She was so nervous,
she was literally shaking,

58:15.385 --> 58:17.544
because there she was,
to give a deposition

58:17.545 --> 58:20.584
and Lance Armstrong
had flown from Austin,

58:20.585 --> 58:23.864
on his private jet to watch her
testify about him

58:23.865 --> 58:27.224
and she knew exactly what kind
of message he was trying to send.

58:27.225 --> 58:31.064
There was a long table
in the conference room

58:31.065 --> 58:35.104
and it was me and my lawyer

58:35.105 --> 58:37.344
and Lance.

58:37.345 --> 58:39.545
<i>- I was furious.
- Why?</i>

58:40.985 --> 58:44.464
So I saw what Lance was doing,
how he was on his BlackBerry,

58:44.465 --> 58:46.464
how he was on his computer.

58:46.465 --> 58:48.185
<i>Because...</i>

58:49.625 --> 58:51.744
<i>It WASN'T a lie.</i>

58:51.745 --> 58:54.984
<i>I'm not going to say somebody is
lying when they are not lying.</i>

58:54.985 --> 58:57.544
She was the first witness
who effectively said,

58:57.545 --> 59:00.704
"I don't care what happens to me.
I'm going to tell the truth."

59:00.705 --> 59:02.384
<i>First, tell me where you were.</i>

59:02.385 --> 59:05.184
<i>Michel's. It's a restaurant
in Villefranche.</i>

59:05.185 --> 59:07.384
I had never been in a
deposition before,

59:07.385 --> 59:09.264
so when I didn't remember something,

59:09.265 --> 59:12.544
a restaurant, I had leaned over
and I asked Lance.

59:12.545 --> 59:15.744
<i>- It is Villefranche, isn't it, Lance?
- Objection. Well...</i>

59:15.745 --> 59:18.304
"You can't do that, hold it,
hold it, you can't do that."

59:18.305 --> 59:21.584
So it was, I was just answering
questions honestly.

59:21.585 --> 59:24.584
<i>I just would like you to recount
what took place</i>

59:24.585 --> 59:27.105
<i>in the Indiana University
Hospital...</i>

59:28.545 --> 59:31.224
<i>The doctor asked him
a couple of questions</i>

59:31.225 --> 59:33.825
<i>and then came the question,
have you ever...</i>

59:35.305 --> 59:38.504
<i>...taken any performance-enhancing
drugs?</i>

59:38.505 --> 59:42.384
<i>And Lance said, yes. The doctor
said, "What were they?" And he said,</i>

59:42.385 --> 59:47.824
<i>"EPO, growth hormone, cortisone,
steroids and testosterone."</i>

59:47.825 --> 59:50.304
<i>Did any medical person ask you</i>

59:50.305 --> 59:52.504
<i>while you were at the Indiana
University Hospital</i>

59:52.505 --> 59:53.984
<i>whether you had ever used</i>

59:53.985 --> 59:57.584
<i>- any sort of performance-enhancing drugs or substances?
- No.</i>

59:57.585 --> 01:00:00.464
<i>Can you offer,
can you help explain to me</i>

01:00:00.465 --> 01:00:03.504
<i>why Miss Andreu would make
that story up?</i>

01:00:03.505 --> 01:00:06.184
<i>Well, she said in her deposition
she hates me.</i>

01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:10.384
<i>I don't know how the doctor phrased the question,
but Lance's response was that he had taken EPO</i>

01:00:10.385 --> 01:00:12.185
<i>and testosterone...</i>

01:00:13.265 --> 01:00:15.544
<i>...and growth hormone</i>

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.265
<i>and cortisone.</i>

01:00:18.505 --> 01:00:21.425
<i>Why would Mr. Andreu say the same
things, if you know?</i>

01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:24.824
<i>Probably to support
his wife, which...</i>

01:00:24.825 --> 01:00:27.624
<i>I don't know if you're
married or not, but... I am.</i>

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:30.944
<i>...sometimes is... required.</i>

01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:35.784
<i>So your testimony that Mr. Andreu
was also lying when he said</i>

01:00:35.785 --> 01:00:39.105
<i>- that he heard you say those things
regarding your prior use?
- 100%.</i>

01:00:44.905 --> 01:00:47.984
<i>- But I feel for him.
- What do you mean by that?</i>

01:00:47.985 --> 01:00:50.185
<i>I think he's trying
to back up his old lady.</i>

01:00:52.385 --> 01:00:54.504
Frankie Andreu was under

01:00:54.505 --> 01:00:58.064
extremely difficult circumstances
at that particular point in time,

01:00:58.065 --> 01:01:00.344
all of which was a result
of Lance Armstrong.

01:01:00.345 --> 01:01:03.744
<i>Did Mr. Armstrong ever tell you
during that time period</i>

01:01:03.745 --> 01:01:06.424
<i>that he definitely
was not going to use EPO</i>

01:01:06.425 --> 01:01:08.584
<i>and no-one else should use EPO?</i>

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:10.104
<i>No.</i>

01:01:10.105 --> 01:01:13.104
<i>Did he indicate to you
that he was going to use EPO</i>

01:01:13.105 --> 01:01:14.825
<i>- or consider using EPO?
- No.</i>

01:01:21.385 --> 01:01:25.344
He said openly and to the public
that Betsy was crazy.

01:01:25.345 --> 01:01:29.224
They implied behind the scenes
that Betsy wasn't believable

01:01:29.225 --> 01:01:32.544
and perhaps unstable.
Everything you can possibly think of

01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:35.904
as a way to hurt someone,
they basically employed.

01:01:35.905 --> 01:01:38.545
<i>And what is it you told Frankie
after leaving the room?</i>

01:01:41.225 --> 01:01:42.825
<i>I...</i>

01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:59.784
His modus operandi, which
was, "Don't attack the message."

01:01:59.785 --> 01:02:01.344
"Attack the messenger."

01:02:01.345 --> 01:02:04.144
So, if people don't know me,
people are going to say,

01:02:04.145 --> 01:02:06.784
"Well, wait a minute,
who is this woman?

01:02:06.785 --> 01:02:11.504
Her husband stopped racing early. If
he was so good, why did he do that?

01:02:11.505 --> 01:02:16.264
If Lance is dirty, then why hasn't
the governing body caught him?

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:20.944
Why does USA Cycling back him?
Why do his sponsors back him?

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:24.264
Why does he keep getting
more and more money from him?

01:02:24.265 --> 01:02:27.544
How come none of these doctors,
who allegedly heard

01:02:27.545 --> 01:02:31.304
what happened in the hospital room,
how come they're remaining quiet?

01:02:31.305 --> 01:02:35.224
How come nobody has backed her up
for that hospital room?

01:02:35.225 --> 01:02:38.024
Look at his legions of fans.

01:02:38.025 --> 01:02:40.704
He has a foundation fighting cancer.

01:02:40.705 --> 01:02:44.744
What is this woman doing
beside raising her own kids?

01:02:44.745 --> 01:02:46.784
His problem
was never with Frankie."

01:02:46.785 --> 01:02:49.224
<i>And after Mr. Armstrong
told the doctor</i>

01:02:49.225 --> 01:02:53.184
<i>he was using certain performance
enhancing drugs, did your husband</i>

01:02:53.185 --> 01:02:56.384
<i>ever tell you, "That's wrong,
he hasn't done those drugs?"</i>

01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:59.224
<i>Not your husband, but Mr. Armstrong?</i>

01:02:59.225 --> 01:03:00.225
<i>No.</i>

01:03:07.265 --> 01:03:09.344
<i>How could it have taken place</i>

01:03:09.345 --> 01:03:12.104
<i>when I've never taken
performance-enhancing drugs?</i>

01:03:12.105 --> 01:03:15.064
<i>- How could that have happened?
- That's my point. It's not just simply</i>

01:03:15.065 --> 01:03:17.344
<i>- you don't recall?
- How many times do I have to say it?</i>

01:03:17.345 --> 01:03:20.144
<i>I'm just trying to make sure
your testimony is clear.</i>

01:03:20.145 --> 01:03:23.624
<i>Well, if it can't be any clearer
than, "I've never taken drugs,"</i>

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:26.024
<i>then incidents like that
could never have happened.</i>

01:03:26.025 --> 01:03:27.385
<i>OK. How clear is that?</i>

01:03:30.065 --> 01:03:34.104
These are things that are so
devious, if untrue, but so powerful

01:03:34.105 --> 01:03:37.784
when you use with people
that makes you a compelling liar.

01:03:37.785 --> 01:03:40.464
I'll give you an example.
Bad liar - Richard Nixon.

01:03:40.465 --> 01:03:43.264
Sweaty, looks suspicious,
said goofy things

01:03:43.265 --> 01:03:45.544
when people challenged him,
"I'm not a crook."

01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:47.504
Great liar - Lance Armstrong.

01:03:47.505 --> 01:03:51.544
"I never doped. I passed every test.
And anyone who challenges me,

01:03:51.545 --> 01:03:54.584
I'm currently suing
and are proving they're lying."

01:03:54.585 --> 01:03:55.744
That's a good liar.

01:03:55.745 --> 01:03:58.584
<i>Greg, who...</i>

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.344
<i>I know has serious drinking
and drug problems,</i>

01:04:01.345 --> 01:04:05.224
<i>was clearly intoxicated,
yelling, screaming.</i>

01:04:05.225 --> 01:04:09.024
<i>It started off as, you know, "Hey,
Greg, I thought we were friends."</i>

01:04:09.025 --> 01:04:11.504
<i>"Friends?!
What do you mean friends?!"</i>

01:04:11.505 --> 01:04:15.424
<i>He said, "Well, if you want to throw
stones... I can throw stones..."</i>

01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:19.464
He went after his reputation,
his livelihood

01:04:19.465 --> 01:04:23.824
- and his way of life.
- <i>Well... let me see...</i>

01:04:23.825 --> 01:04:27.744
<i>being called potentially the biggest
fraud in the history of the sport...</i>

01:04:27.745 --> 01:04:29.624
<i>That was a little bit upsetting.</i>

01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:32.824
He's set out to destroy me
every step of the way.

01:04:32.825 --> 01:04:36.624
I lost, er, a company that did
$20 million in sales in the US.

01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:37.984
<i>Oh, he, you know, he said,</i>

01:04:37.985 --> 01:04:40.624
<i>"The sport is full of crooks
and thieves and liars."</i>

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:43.584
I've been at trade shows,
where dealers that said...

01:04:43.585 --> 01:04:46.544
I would see and that I knew
and they wouldn't even...

01:04:46.545 --> 01:04:48.304
They wouldn't even look at me.

01:04:48.305 --> 01:04:49.704
<i>He didn't like that either.</i>

01:04:49.705 --> 01:04:53.584
How could this be?
How could it be that my career

01:04:53.585 --> 01:04:57.024
collide with this guy and then
he takes everything away from me?

01:04:57.025 --> 01:05:00.184
<i>We also wanted to believe...</i>

01:05:00.185 --> 01:05:01.665
<i>...in Lance.</i>

01:05:04.545 --> 01:05:07.585
<i>And it was hard to find
out that it wasn't...</i>

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:14.264
<i>I don't know why I'm crying, but it
was really hard to find out that...</i>

01:05:14.265 --> 01:05:16.264
<i>this was going on.</i>

01:05:16.265 --> 01:05:19.184
<i>It's been awful stressful.</i>

01:05:19.185 --> 01:05:23.424
<i>If I'd known for a second,
I wouldn't have done it.</i>

01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:27.624
They were very, very mean and
very dismissive of Emma O'Reilly

01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:30.544
as they were really almost of all the women

01:05:30.545 --> 01:05:33.184
that testified against Mr. Armstrong.

01:05:33.185 --> 01:05:36.664
<i>Afraid that we were going
to out her as a...</i>

01:05:36.665 --> 01:05:39.784
<i>All these things she said. As a
whore or whatever. I don't know.</i>

01:05:39.785 --> 01:05:42.904
- <i>Primarily...</i>
- You don't talk about people like that!

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:45.224
And also to...
By calling me those names,

01:05:45.225 --> 01:05:47.384
calling me basically
an alcoholic prostitute,

01:05:47.385 --> 01:05:49.384
it's just attacking me personally,

01:05:49.385 --> 01:05:53.464
but it's not addressing the
points that I brought up.

01:05:53.465 --> 01:05:57.104
You know, and that's probably
what upset me the most over it all.

01:05:57.105 --> 01:05:59.984
<i>Raise your right hand. Do you
solemnly state your testimony</i>

01:05:59.985 --> 01:06:03.024
<i>- shall be the truth, whole truth
and nothing but the truth?
- I do.</i>

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:06.264
We had been told
that Stephanie McIlvain

01:06:06.265 --> 01:06:10.824
would testify that, yes, she heard
Mr. Armstrong admit to drug use,

01:06:10.825 --> 01:06:13.184
so we went out to depose her
in California

01:06:13.185 --> 01:06:15.704
at her place of business,
which was Oakley.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:19.584
<i>- What kind of things do you do?
- I take care of, er...</i>

01:06:19.585 --> 01:06:22.944
<i>Well, I take care of Lance Armstrong
and cycling also.</i>

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:25.744
She called us up
and she was in tears.

01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:29.024
"Lance called me!
Lance is pissed!"

01:06:29.025 --> 01:06:31.504
And I thought, "Oh, my God!"

01:06:31.505 --> 01:06:33.784
I said, "You're going to lie,
Stephanie."

01:06:33.785 --> 01:06:35.504
"You're going to lie
to keep your job."

01:06:35.505 --> 01:06:37.424
Stephanie needed that job.

01:06:37.425 --> 01:06:41.024
Her husband worked for Oakley.
HE needed the job.

01:06:41.025 --> 01:06:44.064
She's got a young son
who's autistic.

01:06:44.065 --> 01:06:46.464
They were in an extremely
difficult position.

01:06:46.465 --> 01:06:48.264
<i>Where you ever in a hospital room,</i>

01:06:48.265 --> 01:06:51.224
<i>or other part of the hospital
with Mr. Armstrong,</i>

01:06:51.225 --> 01:06:55.184
<i>- where he said anything about
performance-enhancing drugs?
- No.</i>

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:59.944
<i>Er, do you have any recollection
of any doctor in your presence</i>

01:06:59.945 --> 01:07:05.064
<i>asking Mr. Armstrong, er,
if he used in the past</i>

01:07:05.065 --> 01:07:08.864
<i>- any performance-enhancing drugs
or substances?
- No.</i>

01:07:08.865 --> 01:07:12.664
Betsy was going to be thrown under
the bus and I finally told her.

01:07:12.665 --> 01:07:17.264
I said, "Betsy...
I recorded her and I have a tape."

01:07:34.145 --> 01:07:35.945
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

01:08:18.745 --> 01:08:20.305
<i>I agree.</i>

01:08:22.944 --> 01:08:25.224
This recording was done
well before her deposition,

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:28.663
so all we could conclude from
that was someone got to her.

01:08:28.665 --> 01:08:30.904
Because she clearly changed
her testimony.

01:09:10.904 --> 01:09:14.703
Once I made that recording public
to the Lance Armstrong side,

01:09:14.705 --> 01:09:17.264
saying, "I think you've
monkeyed with this witness,"

01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:19.504
literally all hell broke loose.

01:09:19.505 --> 01:09:23.464
I said, "You lied, didn't
you?" I just had this bad feeling.

01:09:23.465 --> 01:09:25.544
"You lied, didn't you, Stephanie?"

01:09:25.545 --> 01:09:27.984
"Pat was told,
if I make the company look bad,

01:09:27.984 --> 01:09:31.144
that we'll both lose our jobs. We
can't afford to lose our jobs, Betsy.

01:09:31.145 --> 01:09:33.144
We don't have college degrees.

01:09:33.145 --> 01:09:35.825
Where are we going to go?
What are we going to do?"

01:09:37.225 --> 01:09:39.944
She made her bed.
She made her decision.

01:09:44.425 --> 01:09:46.904
<i>That's a foul! Wow!</i>

01:10:26.425 --> 01:10:28.945
So, our relationship was over.

01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:34.064
<i>If you have a doping offence,
or you test positive,</i>

01:10:34.065 --> 01:10:37.264
<i>it goes without saying that you're
fired, from all of your contracts,</i>

01:10:37.265 --> 01:10:39.584
<i>not just the team, but there's...</i>

01:10:39.585 --> 01:10:44.264
<i>numerous contracts that I have
that would all go away.</i>

01:10:44.265 --> 01:10:49.304
<i>- Sponsorship agreements, for example?
- All of them! And...</i>

01:10:49.305 --> 01:10:52.824
<i>The faith... of all the cancer
survivors around the world,</i>

01:10:52.825 --> 01:10:55.665
<i>so everything I do off of the bike
would go away, too.</i>

01:10:57.745 --> 01:11:01.184
<i>And don't think for a second
I don't understand that.</i>

01:11:01.185 --> 01:11:03.544
Either everyone who I had talked to,

01:11:03.545 --> 01:11:06.104
and all the evidence I had gathered,
and all the scientists

01:11:06.105 --> 01:11:10.824
and other people were liars,
which I found frankly impossible,

01:11:10.825 --> 01:11:13.984
or Lance approached basically
a clinical sociopath.

01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:16.584
Someone able to do wrong
without remorse,

01:11:16.585 --> 01:11:19.704
er, or care as to who
they hurt in the process.

01:11:19.705 --> 01:11:23.224
Er, the former was unpalatable.
The latter, er, was scary.

01:11:23.225 --> 01:11:27.464
That we were litigating with someone
who would do anything to prevail.

01:11:27.465 --> 01:11:28.985
<i>It's not about money for me.</i>

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:34.104
<i>Everything. It's also about the
faith that people have put in me</i>

01:11:34.105 --> 01:11:37.344
<i>over the years, so all of that
would be erased, so I don't need it</i>

01:11:37.345 --> 01:11:40.384
<i>to say in a contract,
"You're fired if you test positive."</i>

01:11:40.385 --> 01:11:43.184
<i>That's not as important</i>

01:11:43.185 --> 01:11:46.265
<i>as losing the support of
hundreds of millions of people.</i>

01:11:47.705 --> 01:11:50.584
<i>That's an easy question.</i>

01:11:50.585 --> 01:11:55.344
The SCA case was settled on really
what it said in the contract.

01:11:55.345 --> 01:11:57.864
<i>Lance has always followed
the rules of the Tour de France</i>

01:11:57.865 --> 01:11:59.504
<i>and he's won seven times.</i>

01:11:59.505 --> 01:12:01.904
<i>Every time he wins,
and he's a certified winner,</i>

01:12:01.905 --> 01:12:03.584
<i>he's followed the rules</i>

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:06.224
<i>and Tailwind has had
an obligation to pay him.</i>

01:12:06.225 --> 01:12:10.464
After all, he was still officially
the Tour de France winner.

01:12:10.465 --> 01:12:15.224
That was really the question and,
if SCA went forward with that case,

01:12:15.225 --> 01:12:17.144
it would have been a big risk.

01:12:17.145 --> 01:12:20.784
So they ended up paying
Armstrong $7 million

01:12:20.785 --> 01:12:21.864
to settle it.

01:12:24.305 --> 01:12:26.544
We just paid.

01:12:26.545 --> 01:12:29.024
Lance slipped past the gates

01:12:29.025 --> 01:12:31.264
and... said,

01:12:31.265 --> 01:12:33.745
"Time to fold your tent, boys."

01:12:35.825 --> 01:12:37.904
<i>Floyd Landis used to ride alongside</i>

01:12:37.905 --> 01:12:41.144
<i>Lance Armstrong on the
US Postal Service for three years.</i>

01:12:41.145 --> 01:12:45.424
<i>They've split up in a little
bit of, er, disenchantment.</i>

01:12:45.425 --> 01:12:48.344
<i>Well, Floyd Landis
has launched an attack.</i>

01:12:48.345 --> 01:12:53.144
<i>He's trying to ride all of these men
off. Surely with eight minutes...</i>

01:12:56.145 --> 01:12:58.784
<i>...he is one of the great riders
of this race once again.</i>

01:12:58.785 --> 01:13:03.504
<i>This is one of the most incredible
performances I've seen. It's fine...</i>

01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:06.184
<i>Is it nice to come out
of the shadows of Armstrong</i>

01:13:06.185 --> 01:13:08.224
<i>in such a golden style?</i>

01:13:08.225 --> 01:13:10.424
<i>Yeah! Again, I've said many times</i>

01:13:10.425 --> 01:13:13.904
<i>I was one of the lucky ones
to be part of his seven wins.</i>

01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:22.544
<i>Yet another doping scandal hits
the very top of the Tour de France.</i>

01:13:22.545 --> 01:13:24.264
<i>Floyd, right here!
'Yes, the winner</i>

01:13:24.265 --> 01:13:27.264
<i>of this year's prestigious
cycling race, Floyd Landis,</i>

01:13:27.265 --> 01:13:29.584
<i>has tested positive
for testosterone.</i>

01:13:29.585 --> 01:13:32.744
<i>It's the first time in the Tour de
France's history that a winner...</i>

01:13:32.745 --> 01:13:37.024
When I look back now, nobody
on that team was ever positive.

01:13:37.025 --> 01:13:41.464
No positives. The moment they left,
every rider that was a competitor,

01:13:41.465 --> 01:13:44.784
that Armstrong didn't like,
boom, they're positive.

01:13:47.665 --> 01:13:49.944
<i>Remember, it's not a race...</i>

01:13:49.945 --> 01:13:51.704
<u>It's been an amazing year.</u>

01:13:51.705 --> 01:13:54.664
<u>I stood up here last year
and everybody at their table</u>

01:13:54.665 --> 01:13:58.144
<u>had little pieces of yellow
silicon sitting there.</u>

01:13:58.145 --> 01:14:00.984
<u>And somewhere along the way,
50 million of them were sold.</u>

01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:03.944
<u>Um...</u>

01:14:03.945 --> 01:14:05.264
<i>Woo!</i>

01:14:05.265 --> 01:14:07.064
<i>What showed up in your sample?</i>

01:14:07.065 --> 01:14:09.904
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:14:09.905 --> 01:14:13.224
<i>- Were you doping at the Tour de France?
- No.</i>

01:14:13.225 --> 01:14:17.864
I told Frankie, "I can't believe
nobody's ever asked you

01:14:17.865 --> 01:14:21.744
whether or not you've ever done
anything or tried anything.

01:14:21.745 --> 01:14:25.024
But if somebody does, I'm not
going to be one of the wives

01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:27.784
who stand by you as you lie.
I'm not going to do it."

01:14:27.785 --> 01:14:30.024
<i>I raced for 12 years
as a professional.</i>

01:14:30.025 --> 01:14:32.624
<i>I used EPO at a...
at a certain moment.</i>

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:36.024
<i>There are many people out there that
worry - whether they have cancer</i>

01:14:36.025 --> 01:14:38.744
<i>in their families or not -
that cancer is going to get them.</i>

01:14:38.745 --> 01:14:41.104
<i>It's the scariest disease there is.</i>

01:14:41.105 --> 01:14:43.584
<i>- And we think we're making a difference.
- I agree.</i>

01:14:43.585 --> 01:14:47.904
<i>One of my biggest accomplishments
was raising my son Lance.</i>

01:14:47.905 --> 01:14:51.505
<i>I am so proud to be the mom
of Lance Armstrong.</i>

01:14:53.825 --> 01:14:58.184
<i>We will lose more than 560,000
Americans to cancer this year.</i>

01:14:58.185 --> 01:15:02.224
<i>Landis was stripped of his title and
banned from the sport for two years.</i>

01:15:02.225 --> 01:15:05.744
<i>It's time for a government
that wages a war against cancer</i>

01:15:05.745 --> 01:15:08.744
<i>as aggressive as the war
cancer wages against us.</i>

01:15:08.745 --> 01:15:12.624
<i>We will beat this dreaded disease,
and we will win.</i>

01:15:15.025 --> 01:15:18.864
The longer it went on,
the more impressed I am that Lance

01:15:18.865 --> 01:15:23.024
could maintain a story like that
that was nearly 100% fabricated.

01:15:23.025 --> 01:15:27.224
And still live
such an obnoxious life.

01:15:27.225 --> 01:15:29.224
And not even try to hide it.

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:32.585
I mean, I'm a guy
that he's never really even met...

01:15:40.065 --> 01:15:44.464
<i>Mr. President, you've been
a long-time friend of mine.</i>

01:15:44.465 --> 01:15:47.184
<i>Thank you. Thank you for being
a friend and for allowing us</i>

01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:51.024
<i>to be here to talk about
this critical, er, issue.</i>

01:15:51.025 --> 01:15:53.224
<i>As some of you may or may not know,</i>

01:15:53.225 --> 01:15:56.784
<i>I've decided
to race my bicycle again.</i>

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.544
<i>Um...</i>

01:15:58.545 --> 01:15:59.785
<i>It...</i>

01:16:01.385 --> 01:16:04.304
Lance came back,
because he couldn't stay away.

01:16:04.305 --> 01:16:08.144
<i>Please welcome seven-time Tour de
France champion Lance Armstrong.</i>

01:16:09.905 --> 01:16:13.624
Why couldn't he stay away?
Because it's like

01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:17.304
the oldest theme in Hollywood
that you've ever come across.

01:16:17.305 --> 01:16:23.384
The jewel thief,
the bank robber, the assassin.

01:16:23.385 --> 01:16:27.424
They do their jobs brilliantly.
They win every time.

01:16:27.425 --> 01:16:29.344
They kill all the people
they should kill,

01:16:29.345 --> 01:16:31.384
they get all the jewels
they should get,

01:16:31.385 --> 01:16:33.664
they get all the money
from the bank they should get.

01:16:33.665 --> 01:16:35.905
Somebody comes and says,
"One more job."

01:16:40.065 --> 01:16:44.224
Just one more little turn
of the carousel.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:47.544
And they can't resist.

01:16:47.545 --> 01:16:53.104
Because that was them living
like they'd never lived before

01:16:53.105 --> 01:16:54.825
or they will never live again.

01:16:57.665 --> 01:17:00.504
<i>I cannot guarantee a victory
this time, I'm not... What?</i>

01:17:00.505 --> 01:17:02.105
<i>Please stop your whining.</i>

01:17:09.065 --> 01:17:11.104
I'd made several requests
to interview Lance,

01:17:11.105 --> 01:17:12.464
especially when he announced

01:17:12.465 --> 01:17:14.984
that he was going to be different
this time with the media,

01:17:14.985 --> 01:17:16.784
that he was going to be open
and transparent

01:17:16.785 --> 01:17:19.824
and there wasn't going to be any of
the stuff that had gone on before

01:17:19.825 --> 01:17:22.184
where he had been very, very difficult.

01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:24.664
And I baited him.

01:17:24.665 --> 01:17:29.624
<i>Lance, we've spoken recently
about the return of Ivan Basso</i>

01:17:29.625 --> 01:17:34.344
<i>and Floyd Landis after
their suspensions.</i>

01:17:34.345 --> 01:17:38.784
<i>What is it about these dopers
that you seem to admire so much?</i>

01:17:38.785 --> 01:17:40.464
<i>Excuse me? What is your name again?</i>

01:17:40.465 --> 01:17:43.024
<i>My name is Paul Kimmage,
I work for The Sunday Times.</i>

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:45.944
<i>I asked for an interview,
but I didn't get one.</i>

01:17:45.945 --> 01:17:49.104
<i>Right, and just as a little preface,
I might just clear up one thing.</i>

01:17:49.105 --> 01:17:52.104
<i>The reason you didn't get it, Paul,
I wanted to make sure that was you,</i>

01:17:52.105 --> 01:17:55.024
<i>because I don't know
what you look like...</i>

01:17:55.025 --> 01:18:00.384
<i>When I decided to come back for
what I think is a very noble reason,</i>

01:18:00.385 --> 01:18:06.104
<i>you said, "Folks, the cancer has
been in remission for four years,</i>

01:18:06.105 --> 01:18:08.585
<i>but our cancer has now returned."</i>

01:18:10.265 --> 01:18:12.584
<i>Meaning me.</i>

01:18:12.585 --> 01:18:14.744
<i>I am here to fight this disease.</i>

01:18:14.745 --> 01:18:16.824
<i>I am here so that
I don't have to deal with it,</i>

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.344
<i>you don't have to deal with it,</i>

01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:21.584
<i>none of us have to deal with it, my
children don't have to deal with it.</i>

01:18:21.585 --> 01:18:24.184
<i>But yet you said
that I am the cancer.</i>

01:18:24.185 --> 01:18:26.184
<i>So, I think it goes without saying,</i>

01:18:26.185 --> 01:18:29.464
<i>no, we're not going to sit down
and do an interview.</i>

01:18:29.465 --> 01:18:31.784
<i>And I don't think
anybody in this room</i>

01:18:31.785 --> 01:18:33.584
<i>would sit down for that interview.</i>

01:18:33.585 --> 01:18:35.944
<i>You are not worth the chair
that you're sitting on</i>

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:37.424
<i>with a statement like that.</i>

01:18:37.425 --> 01:18:40.825
<i>With a disease that touches
everybody around the world.</i>

01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:04.024
<i>Getting back to the
Tour Of California...</i>

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:12.104
<i>Armstrong,
shades of his seven victories</i>

01:19:12.105 --> 01:19:15.424
<i>in the Tour de France, he's got
happy memories of the Pyrenees</i>

01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:17.944
<i>and they're all coming back now.</i>

01:19:17.945 --> 01:19:22.024
When Floyd has lost all his money,
fighting his ban,

01:19:22.025 --> 01:19:24.384
and he calls up Johan Bruyneel
and says,

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:27.224
"Look, will you get me on your team?
I need a place."

01:19:27.225 --> 01:19:31.384
And Lance and Bruyneel,
both kindred spirits

01:19:31.385 --> 01:19:35.104
in terms of having
no emotional intelligence,

01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:37.744
decide they don't want to
have anything to do with Floyd -

01:19:37.745 --> 01:19:40.184
he's just a loser, he got caught.

01:19:40.185 --> 01:19:43.624
They don't realise that
they're... they're actually

01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:46.664
handling a ticking bomb here.

01:19:46.665 --> 01:19:50.744
Floyd has offered them the chance
to diffuse the bomb.

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:53.184
To just take out that little pin
or whatever,

01:19:53.185 --> 01:19:56.425
give him a little, small job
in the team, everything is OK.

01:19:58.025 --> 01:20:01.385
They tell him to get lost and
the bomb blows up in their faces.

01:20:03.585 --> 01:20:05.384
And when he saw Armstrong,

01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:08.984
who he knew from the first day
he'd entered the sport was doped,

01:20:08.985 --> 01:20:11.384
who had shown Floyd how to dope

01:20:11.385 --> 01:20:13.984
and all he sees is this
fucking shit everywhere,

01:20:13.985 --> 01:20:16.744
"Hope rides again."
"The Great God."

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:19.384
"The Jesus of cycling
is coming back."

01:20:19.385 --> 01:20:23.504
And all the spectators are
getting down on bended knee

01:20:23.505 --> 01:20:27.384
and he's thinking, "This is not
right. This sticks in my throat."

01:20:27.385 --> 01:20:29.425
"I fucking am going to
sort this out."

01:20:31.185 --> 01:20:34.024
At least now I've confirmed
that there's nothing else to lose.

01:20:34.025 --> 01:20:36.624
Nothing. There's nothing in it for me
in cycling.

01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:38.144
There's no team for me. There's...

01:20:38.145 --> 01:20:41.984
No matter what I do, it's going to
be worse and worse until I leave.

01:20:41.985 --> 01:20:43.985
Eventually, the levee breaks.

01:20:48.185 --> 01:20:51.504
<i>Tonight, Landis and
others once close to Lance</i>

01:20:51.505 --> 01:20:54.944
<i>go on camera for the first time
for our special report -</i>

01:20:54.945 --> 01:20:56.224
<i>"Did Lance Cheat?"</i>

01:20:56.225 --> 01:20:57.984
<i>At some point people have to tell</i>

01:20:57.985 --> 01:20:59.985
<i>their kids that Santa Claus
isn't real.</i>

01:21:01.545 --> 01:21:03.345
<i>I hate to be the guy to do it,
but...</i>

01:21:04.705 --> 01:21:06.464
<i>...it's just not real.</i>

01:21:06.465 --> 01:21:08.225
<i>You're saying Lance Armstrong
is a liar?</i>

01:21:09.505 --> 01:21:13.784
<i>Yes, I suppose if that's
the question, yes.</i>

01:21:13.785 --> 01:21:16.064
<i>We have somebody that's been
under oath several times</i>

01:21:16.065 --> 01:21:17.784
<i>with a completely different version.</i>

01:21:17.785 --> 01:21:19.584
<i>You have somebody
that has written a book</i>

01:21:19.585 --> 01:21:21.304
<i>with a completely different version.</i>

01:21:21.305 --> 01:21:24.264
<i>You have somebody that took
people's money for their defence,</i>

01:21:24.265 --> 01:21:27.344
<i>some would say a million dollars,
with a completely different version.</i>

01:21:27.345 --> 01:21:31.264
<i>He said he has nothing, he's got
no proof. It's his word versus ours.</i>

01:21:31.265 --> 01:21:34.344
<i>We like our word, we like where
we stand, we like our credibility.</i>

01:21:34.345 --> 01:21:38.584
<i>As Lance Armstrong prepares for his
final weekend at the Tour de France,</i>

01:21:38.585 --> 01:21:41.824
<i>a federal investigation
into alleged doping by him</i>

01:21:41.825 --> 01:21:45.624
<i>and his former team threatens
to tarnish his golden image.</i>

01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:48.784
<i>The investigation was sparked
by allegations by former friend</i>

01:21:48.785 --> 01:21:51.424
<i>and team-mate Floyd Landis.</i>

01:21:51.425 --> 01:21:56.104
At the end of July, I got a
phone call from Jeff Novitzky

01:21:56.105 --> 01:21:58.864
and one of the first questions
I asked him was,

01:21:58.865 --> 01:22:01.104
"What's taken you so
long to call me?"

01:22:01.105 --> 01:22:03.024
It was scary, because that whole,

01:22:03.025 --> 01:22:05.424
"This is Jeff Novitzky,
federal agent..."

01:22:05.425 --> 01:22:07.864
It put the holy terror
of God in you.

01:22:07.865 --> 01:22:11.744
Novitzky was able to bring
these guys into a room.

01:22:11.745 --> 01:22:13.864
He would open up his coat and,

01:22:13.865 --> 01:22:16.464
"Oh, sorry I didn't mean you
to see my gun..."

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:19.864
That's what they do. And then he
takes his sheriff's badge out,

01:22:19.865 --> 01:22:23.064
drops it on the table, in case
you forget that he's a cop,

01:22:23.065 --> 01:22:24.504
and then he says to you,

01:22:24.505 --> 01:22:27.104
"You know, if you lie to us,

01:22:27.105 --> 01:22:29.424
it'll be perjury.

01:22:29.425 --> 01:22:31.824
And we will know you're lying
to us,

01:22:31.825 --> 01:22:34.264
because of all we know
about this case.

01:22:34.265 --> 01:22:38.145
And then we will go after you and
you'll end up doing prison time."

01:22:41.505 --> 01:22:44.944
A subpoena means you come in.
There's no question.

01:22:44.945 --> 01:22:48.424
You go in and you tell the truth
in front of the Grand Jury.

01:22:48.425 --> 01:22:50.064
No lawyer by your side.

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:52.144
I probably told them
more stuff, more detail,

01:22:52.145 --> 01:22:55.104
than what I had revealed
to anybody else before.

01:22:55.105 --> 01:22:58.064
You know, the information kind
of started trickling out of me

01:22:58.065 --> 01:23:01.744
and then, after 15 minutes or so,
it just poured out of me.

01:23:01.745 --> 01:23:05.625
I don't think they were expecting
any kind of testimony like they got.

01:23:08.585 --> 01:23:11.304
Lance Armstrong
didn't appreciate that.

01:23:11.305 --> 01:23:13.864
A few months later, I was out
at dinner with some friends

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:20.024
and... he must have had eyes on me,
because he had people contact him

01:23:20.025 --> 01:23:24.624
and let him know where I was,
and he, you know, approached me,

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.584
and tried to intimidate me.

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:29.304
He said he was going to
make my life a living hell -

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:32.025
both in the courtroom
and out of the courtroom.

01:23:35.465 --> 01:23:38.264
Lance was really pissed
that Greg questioned why

01:23:38.265 --> 01:23:40.024
he was working with Ferrari.

01:23:40.025 --> 01:23:44.544
<i>He helped call the shots.
Yes, he doped himself.</i>

01:23:44.545 --> 01:23:46.104
<i>If he didn't win the Tour,</i>

01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:48.344
<i>someone else that was doped
would have won the Tour.</i>

01:23:48.345 --> 01:23:51.224
I really felt happy at that moment,
because I thought,

01:23:51.225 --> 01:23:53.424
that's it. There is no way back now

01:23:53.425 --> 01:23:55.904
because Floyd had given
chapter and verse

01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:59.864
and I thought the tide
was now irreversible.

01:23:59.865 --> 01:24:03.744
<i>Lance Armstrong handed me
some testosterone patches.</i>

01:24:03.745 --> 01:24:06.104
<i>It's just a little patch
that you put on your skin.</i>

01:24:06.105 --> 01:24:10.344
<i>They can't say that. Nobody is
that conniving.</i>

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:12.104
<i>Nobody is that good,</i>

01:24:12.105 --> 01:24:15.865
<i>to try and get away with something
for 17, 18, 19 years, no way.</i>

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.064
<i>No.</i>

01:24:19.065 --> 01:24:22.624
If you think he was facing jail,

01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:24.545
he had to have been scared to death.

01:24:25.825 --> 01:24:29.824
He called every single famous,

01:24:29.825 --> 01:24:31.864
political favour

01:24:31.865 --> 01:24:34.744
he could possibly pull in.

01:24:34.745 --> 01:24:37.504
I had just woken up,
I'd switched on my phone.

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:42.864
My brother had direct messaged
me on Twitter and saying,

01:24:42.865 --> 01:24:46.065
"WTF, the Feds' case
has been dropped."

01:24:51.825 --> 01:24:55.464
When you want to give news that
you don't want anybody to notice,

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:58.104
you put it out at a time
when everybody is distracted

01:24:58.105 --> 01:24:59.584
by somebody else.

01:24:59.585 --> 01:25:02.704
This news was dropped late
on a Friday afternoon

01:25:02.705 --> 01:25:06.345
on Super Bowl weekend,
when America goes into party mode.

01:25:08.465 --> 01:25:11.904
And Lance Armstrong,
for one weekend,

01:25:11.905 --> 01:25:14.025
ceases to be relevant.

01:25:24.465 --> 01:25:26.504
Obama was running for re-election

01:25:26.505 --> 01:25:30.904
and it wouldn't have looked good
to go after the American hero

01:25:30.905 --> 01:25:34.704
who still had a lot of supporters.

01:25:34.705 --> 01:25:36.784
<i>More Americans entered
the workforce...</i>

01:25:36.785 --> 01:25:39.864
It goes to show you the power
that Armstrong has.

01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:42.544
He got a federal investigation
shut down,

01:25:42.545 --> 01:25:45.104
despite having all that
information out there

01:25:45.105 --> 01:25:46.905
and all that evidence out there.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:53.264
I was not proud to be an American at the
time.

01:25:53.265 --> 01:25:57.064
I was so disappointed in
the whole system, you know.

01:25:57.065 --> 01:26:00.624
That, you know, this corruption
can happen and, you know,

01:26:00.625 --> 01:26:02.625
favours can be granted.

01:26:10.345 --> 01:26:12.744
Travis Tygart picks up the baton.

01:26:12.745 --> 01:26:15.224
He says, "I'm going to
ask all these cyclists

01:26:15.225 --> 01:26:17.344
to come and be interviewed by me."

01:26:17.345 --> 01:26:19.704
This was not just Lance Armstrong

01:26:19.705 --> 01:26:22.224
getting away with doping
for a few years.

01:26:22.225 --> 01:26:26.624
This was something by far bigger
and greater than just that -

01:26:26.625 --> 01:26:29.184
they took it to an entirely
different level

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:33.344
and no other team, right,
won seven Tour de Frances.

01:26:33.345 --> 01:26:35.344
And all the glory
and all the profits

01:26:35.345 --> 01:26:38.904
and all the sponsorships
that went along with that.

01:26:38.905 --> 01:26:42.144
He was the boss.
The evidence is clear.

01:26:42.145 --> 01:26:46.224
He was one of the ring leaders
of this conspiracy

01:26:46.225 --> 01:26:48.184
that pulled off this grand heist,

01:26:48.185 --> 01:26:51.304
using tens of millions
of taxpayer dollars,

01:26:51.305 --> 01:26:55.145
that defrauded millions of sports
fans and his fellow competitors.

01:26:57.585 --> 01:27:00.464
Lance immediately went on the
attack, immediately sued them in his

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.304
home court and immediately
started saying,

01:27:02.305 --> 01:27:04.904
"You saw it as a terrible, bad,
kangaroo court organisation."

01:27:04.905 --> 01:27:06.864
I thought, "Here we go again.

01:27:06.865 --> 01:27:10.624
He's going to bloody them up.
He's going to walk away from this."

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:14.224
<i>Good morning, everybody,
welcome to the Team RadioShack bus...</i>

01:27:14.225 --> 01:27:15.704
Almost at every turn,

01:27:15.705 --> 01:27:18.744
the lobbyists for Armstrong and
his criminal defence attorney

01:27:18.745 --> 01:27:21.584
and others wanted to bankrupt us
and take us down.

01:27:21.585 --> 01:27:24.344
<i>- The boss.
- How are you? Good morning.</i>

01:27:24.345 --> 01:27:28.904
Whether it was claiming to the
world media we had not authority or

01:27:28.905 --> 01:27:33.784
we were on witch hunts or the
jurisdiction didn't rest with us,

01:27:33.785 --> 01:27:35.744
there were numerous efforts by them

01:27:35.745 --> 01:27:38.344
to ensure this
information never got out.

01:27:38.345 --> 01:27:41.304
<i>Your investigations showed
that there were personal threats</i>

01:27:41.305 --> 01:27:45.424
<i>made against riders who had
decided to come clean.</i>

01:27:45.425 --> 01:27:49.144
<i>- I wonder if there were any threats against you?
- There were, Scott.</i>

01:27:49.145 --> 01:27:55.504
<i>These threats came from where? / E-mails, letters.
Anonymous? / Yeah.</i>

01:27:55.505 --> 01:27:59.385
<i>Can you remember any of the lines
from the e-mails or the letters?</i>

01:28:03.225 --> 01:28:07.384
<i>The worst was probably
putting a bullet in my head.</i>

01:28:07.385 --> 01:28:09.625
<i>- Did you take that seriously?
- Absolutely.</i>

01:28:12.025 --> 01:28:15.705
<i>Turned it over to the FBI to
investigate it. Which they're doing.</i>

01:28:19.665 --> 01:28:23.744
<i>A new report from the US
Anti-Doping Agency reveals...</i>

01:28:23.745 --> 01:28:25.624
<i>Just months after
federal prosecutors</i>

01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:29.024
<i>dropped their investigation,
the US Anti-Doping Agency says</i>

01:28:29.025 --> 01:28:31.304
<i>they now have proof that
the seven-time winner</i>

01:28:31.305 --> 01:28:32.664
<i>of the Tour de France...</i>

01:28:32.665 --> 01:28:34.504
<i>From our end, it was never personal.</i>

01:28:34.505 --> 01:28:36.624
<i>In fact, you know, we gave
him the same opportunity</i>

01:28:36.625 --> 01:28:38.384
<i>to come in and be part of
the solution.</i>

01:28:38.385 --> 01:28:40.824
<i>1,000 pages of evidence</i>

01:28:40.825 --> 01:28:43.624
<i>provided by the agency
include first-hand accounts,</i>

01:28:43.625 --> 01:28:44.945
<i>scientific documents...</i>

01:28:48.545 --> 01:28:52.984
Lance believed that he was
bulletproof, that he was invincible,

01:28:52.985 --> 01:28:55.624
that they could
bring down the Floyds,

01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:57.984
the Tylers,
they could bring down anybody.

01:28:57.985 --> 01:28:59.624
"But you can't bring down me,

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:02.785
because I am too big
to be brought down."

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:07.104
<i>I thought in light of recent events,
I ought to reintroduce myself.</i>

01:29:07.105 --> 01:29:10.224
<i>My name is Lance Armstrong.
I'm a cancer survivor.</i>

01:29:10.225 --> 01:29:13.824
<i>I've been asked to come up here and
talk about my story of survivorship.</i>

01:29:13.825 --> 01:29:18.945
<i>I'm a father of five and, yes,
I won the Tour de France seven times.</i>

01:29:23.665 --> 01:29:26.784
<i>UCI will ban Lance Armstrong
from cycling</i>

01:29:26.785 --> 01:29:30.705
<i>and UCI will strip him of
his seven Tour de France titles.</i>

01:29:32.065 --> 01:29:34.305
<i>Lance Armstrong has no
place in cycling.</i>

01:29:38.025 --> 01:29:39.784
<i>I don't have anything to worry
about.</i>

01:29:39.785 --> 01:29:43.184
<i>Nobody needs to cry for me.
I'm going to be great.</i>

01:29:43.185 --> 01:29:46.224
<i>Are you doing something to take
your mind off the news this week?</i>

01:29:46.225 --> 01:29:48.985
<i>I'm more at ease now than
I have been in ten years.</i>

01:29:50.265 --> 01:29:54.544
What surprised me was how
quickly it fell apart.

01:29:54.545 --> 01:29:57.064
<i>This was a day
we could not have imagined.</i>

01:29:57.065 --> 01:29:59.144
<i>Nike has fired Lance Armstrong</i>

01:29:59.145 --> 01:30:02.144
<i>over allegations he
was doping during races.</i>

01:30:02.145 --> 01:30:06.224
And it first hit me when Nike
announced they were fleeing.

01:30:06.225 --> 01:30:08.064
<i>Over the last ten years,</i>

01:30:08.065 --> 01:30:11.304
<i>he's made more than an
estimated $100 million.</i>

01:30:11.305 --> 01:30:14.824
<i>What am I on? I'm on my bike,
busting my ass six hours a day.</i>

01:30:14.825 --> 01:30:16.584
<i>What are YOU on?</i>

01:30:16.585 --> 01:30:20.344
And then, almost in rapid
succession, everyone left him.

01:30:20.345 --> 01:30:24.384
<i>Anheuser-Busch, FRS sports drinks,
Trek bicycles and Giro helmets</i>

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:27.264
<i>all dropped today like dominoes.</i>

01:30:27.265 --> 01:30:29.945
And suddenly, in a matter
of days, it collapsed.

01:30:32.545 --> 01:30:35.024
<i>Oh, my golly, the category tonight.</i>

01:30:35.025 --> 01:30:38.064
<i>Paul, take a guess what you think
the category might be tonight.</i>

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:40.264
<i>Well, could it...? Something about Lance
Armstrong?</i>

01:30:40.265 --> 01:30:42.904
<i>Nice going. Nice going!</i>

01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:45.905
<i>Honest to God, who cares
about cy...? No-one.</i>

01:30:55.905 --> 01:30:57.904
We were pulling
into the driveway and,

01:30:57.905 --> 01:31:00.784
right when we pulled into the
driveway, Betsy's phone rings

01:31:00.785 --> 01:31:04.224
and Betsy turned to me
and she goes, "It's Lance."

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:06.024
And our daughter in the back said,

01:31:06.025 --> 01:31:08.944
"Is it really him?
Is it really him?"

01:31:08.945 --> 01:31:11.624
He apologised. Apologised
for everything he'd done.

01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:14.584
And I said, "You know, it must be...
It's got to be a tough phone call

01:31:14.585 --> 01:31:17.224
for you to make..." I said,
"You know,

01:31:17.225 --> 01:31:19.304
I appreciate it," and I said,

01:31:19.305 --> 01:31:22.744
"I'm sure you're going through hell
for the last month and a half."

01:31:22.745 --> 01:31:24.264
I said, "But no...

01:31:24.265 --> 01:31:27.224
That I'd been going through hell
for ten years with this shit."

01:31:27.225 --> 01:31:33.945
The Lance in that phone call
was a Lance I've never, ever...

01:31:36.865 --> 01:31:38.984
It was a Lance I didn't know.

01:31:38.985 --> 01:31:41.144
He really, genuinely seemed contrite.

01:31:41.145 --> 01:31:42.745
Um...

01:31:47.225 --> 01:31:48.945
And he apologised.

01:31:50.465 --> 01:31:54.785
He said he had done a lot of bad
things to a lot of good people.

01:31:56.505 --> 01:32:00.265
I said, "Lance, you better admit
that that hospital room happened."

01:32:02.265 --> 01:32:08.385
<i>Now the worldwide exclusive
Oprah and Lance Armstrong.</i>

01:32:09.945 --> 01:32:12.824
<i>So let's start with the questions
that people around the world</i>

01:32:12.825 --> 01:32:14.584
<i>have been waiting for you to answer</i>

01:32:14.585 --> 01:32:17.544
<i>and for now I'd just like
a yes or no.</i>

01:32:17.545 --> 01:32:21.304
<i>Did you ever take banned substances
to enhance your cycling performance?</i>

01:32:21.305 --> 01:32:22.585
<i>Yes.</i>

01:32:24.025 --> 01:32:28.864
<i>- Yes or no, was one of those banned
substances EPO?
- Yes.</i>

01:32:28.865 --> 01:32:30.624
I was physically sick.

01:32:30.625 --> 01:32:32.304
<i>Did you ever blood dope</i>

01:32:32.305 --> 01:32:36.184
<i>- or use blood transfusions to enhance
your cycling performance?
- Yes.</i>

01:32:36.185 --> 01:32:38.504
It was sort of like an old Mike Tyson
fight,

01:32:38.505 --> 01:32:40.784
that by the time you sat down
in your ringside seat,

01:32:40.785 --> 01:32:43.024
he'd already knocked the
guy out and it was over.

01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:46.784
<i>Did you ever use any other banned
substances like testosterone,</i>

01:32:46.785 --> 01:32:49.584
<i>cortisone or human growth hormone?</i>

01:32:49.585 --> 01:32:50.904
<i>Yes.</i>

01:32:50.905 --> 01:32:54.744
I was, like, holy shit. Wow.

01:32:54.745 --> 01:32:56.185
Wow!

01:32:58.345 --> 01:33:01.145
Yeah, am I jealous and bitter
and vindictive now?

01:33:02.505 --> 01:33:06.304
<i>In all seven of your
Tour de France victories,</i>

01:33:06.305 --> 01:33:10.904
<i>- did you ever take banned substances or blood dope?
- Yes.</i>

01:33:10.905 --> 01:33:14.504
Those five yeses in one fell swoop,

01:33:14.505 --> 01:33:19.184
just wiped out a generation
of cyclists.

01:33:19.185 --> 01:33:21.944
Watching the show,
for me, was like...

01:33:21.945 --> 01:33:25.544
I never thought those words would
come out of Lance Armstrong's mouth.

01:33:25.545 --> 01:33:26.585
It was unbelievable.

01:33:28.225 --> 01:33:32.864
<i>Was Betsy telling the truth
about the Indiana hospital</i>

01:33:32.865 --> 01:33:36.224
<i>- overhearing you in 1996?
- Erm...</i>

01:33:36.225 --> 01:33:39.984
<i>I'm not going to take that on.
I'm laying down on that one.</i>

01:33:39.985 --> 01:33:41.984
<i>Was Betsy lying?</i>

01:33:41.985 --> 01:33:43.425
<i>Erm...</i>

01:33:46.385 --> 01:33:47.905
And he dropped the ball.

01:33:49.305 --> 01:33:51.584
He dropped the ball.

01:33:51.585 --> 01:33:54.944
<i>- She asked me and I asked her not to talk about...
- What you said?</i>

01:33:54.945 --> 01:33:58.784
<i>...the details of the call. It was a
confidential, personal conversation.</i>

01:33:58.785 --> 01:34:01.704
It was 40 minutes long.

01:34:01.705 --> 01:34:03.664
So again, it was classic Lance.

01:34:03.665 --> 01:34:08.024
His way out, throughout that whole
interview, he... he just used me.

01:34:08.025 --> 01:34:10.864
He called to apologise so that when
he went on Oprah he could say,

01:34:10.865 --> 01:34:13.024
<i>"Oh, yeah, I've reached out
to people to apologise.</i>

01:34:13.025 --> 01:34:15.504
<i>I'm a changed man.
I'm trying to be better."</i>

01:34:15.505 --> 01:34:17.944
<i>It played into his hand.
It played into his game.</i>

01:34:17.945 --> 01:34:20.624
<i>My stepfather called me and said,</i>

01:34:20.625 --> 01:34:22.624
<i>"Your mom's having a
really hard time."</i>

01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:24.105
<i>And I saw my mom...</i>

01:34:26.345 --> 01:34:28.745
<i>...and I thought, "Oh...</i>

01:34:30.705 --> 01:34:31.945
<i>..this woman's a wreck."</i>

01:34:35.305 --> 01:34:38.665
<i>What has been the financial cost?
Have you lost everything?</i>

01:34:40.225 --> 01:34:42.345
<i>I don't like thinking about it.</i>

01:34:43.545 --> 01:34:46.104
<i>But that was a...</i>

01:34:46.105 --> 01:34:50.705
<i>I don't know,
that was a $75 million day.</i>

01:34:53.985 --> 01:34:56.345
<i>- Gone. Gone.
- Gone.</i>

01:34:58.425 --> 01:35:01.464
Do you think he
will ever come clean?

01:35:01.465 --> 01:35:03.424
No, I don't think fully.

01:35:03.425 --> 01:35:05.905
Partly because it would
burn too many people.

01:35:07.705 --> 01:35:10.064
He's protected Bruyneel,
he's protected Ferrari,

01:35:10.065 --> 01:35:12.944
he's protected Thom Weisel,
he's protected Bill Stapleton

01:35:12.945 --> 01:35:16.505
and he's protected, I believe,
the medical people at that hospital.

01:35:18.505 --> 01:35:21.224
It's really not about him,
but about the people behind him.

01:35:21.225 --> 01:35:23.984
They put this team together
that had knowledge of the doping,

01:35:23.985 --> 01:35:26.624
that went out and
then sold sponsorships

01:35:26.625 --> 01:35:31.024
to the tune of about 30+ million
federal dollars from citizens

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:33.985
of the United States of America.
It's alleged fraud.

01:35:37.585 --> 01:35:39.784
I don't know Lance Armstrong now.

01:35:39.785 --> 01:35:42.584
The man I knew in 1993,
I had a blast with.

01:35:42.585 --> 01:35:44.264
A great friend and it's hard for me

01:35:44.265 --> 01:35:46.664
to talk about because of
how much hell he put me through

01:35:46.665 --> 01:35:47.945
and my wife through.

01:35:50.585 --> 01:35:53.224
He's like the guy who robs a bank

01:35:53.225 --> 01:35:57.944
and then says, "Oops, forgot to
frisk the tellers for any money

01:35:57.945 --> 01:36:00.304
they might have in their pockets."

01:36:00.305 --> 01:36:02.985
So he essentially wanted it all.

01:36:08.385 --> 01:36:11.865
Most of the cheats pretty much
stop at the water's edge.

01:36:14.905 --> 01:36:17.104
Lance didn't.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:19.665
<i>I had it. And then I just...</i>

01:36:22.105 --> 01:36:24.465
<i>Things got too big.
Things got too crazy.</i>

01:36:32.545 --> 01:36:35.305
What Lance never had
was the truth...

01:36:36.545 --> 01:36:39.625
...which is more powerful
than the corrupt athlete.

01:36:49.145 --> 01:36:51.145
<i>It's an epic story.</i>

01:36:56.425 --> 01:36:57.745
Time flies, huh?

01:37:01.025 --> 01:37:02.585
Who would have thought?

01:37:03.305 --> 01:37:09.499
