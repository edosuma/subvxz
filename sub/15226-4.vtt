01:22.848 --> 01:24.249
Who am I kidding?

01:24.316 --> 01:27.218
I just don't have it in me to be
a good television executive.

01:27.286 --> 01:29.988
I'm... I'm too concerned
about people liking me.

01:30.055 --> 01:32.056
I-I'm too afraid
to get tough.

01:32.124 --> 01:33.591
Janine, when you're against
           the wall,

01:33.659 --> 01:35.126
you always come through.

01:35.194 --> 01:36.661
But I've got something
really unpleasant to do,

01:36.728 --> 01:38.396
and I don't think
I can do it.

01:38.464 --> 01:39.697
You'll do it,
              because your sense

01:39.765 --> 01:41.166
of responsibility
            will make you do it.

01:41.233 --> 01:42.400
And you'll do it great.

01:42.468 --> 01:43.535
JANINE:
I don't think so.

01:43.602 --> 01:44.803
I'm so nervous
about it.

01:44.870 --> 01:47.204
MAN:
Janine, you can do it.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.740
Maybe you're right.

01:49.808 --> 01:52.644
Of course, I'm right.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.078
Okay, here goes.

01:54.146 --> 01:55.846
I'm gonna have
to fire you.

01:55.914 --> 01:57.348
What?

01:57.416 --> 02:00.151
Mitch, if the ratings don't
come up next week, you're fired.

02:00.219 --> 02:01.286
Nothing personal.

02:01.354 --> 02:02.554
No.

02:02.621 --> 02:05.056
Oh, driver,
I'll get out here.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.258
Mitch, thanks.

02:07.326 --> 02:08.859
Oh, you helped me again.

02:08.926 --> 02:10.228
Thanks a million.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.729
You're welcome.

02:11.797 --> 02:14.165
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

02:17.136 --> 02:18.636
Oh, God!

02:18.704 --> 02:20.305
(clears throat)
    Ah.

02:20.372 --> 02:23.575
You can't live with 'em,
     you can't live without 'em.

02:26.512 --> 02:29.180
You're in television, right?

02:29.248 --> 02:30.415
Oh, yeah.

02:30.483 --> 02:34.452
You look pretty young to
         be a network executive.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.687
Well, it's a young man's
          profession.

02:36.755 --> 02:38.656
In my business,
      you can be burnt out

02:38.724 --> 02:40.358
by the time your skin clears up.

02:40.425 --> 02:41.726
Uh-huh.

02:41.793 --> 02:45.563
You know, I've
                 always wondered

02:45.631 --> 02:50.068
how the networks decide
           what shows to put on.

02:50.136 --> 02:53.104
It's a lot of complex variables.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.541
We-We look at sex,
       education, income.

02:56.608 --> 02:57.976
It's-It's very scientific.

02:58.044 --> 03:01.179
Oh, then how come
    you took off <i>Star Trek?</i>

03:01.280 --> 03:03.081
What?

03:03.149 --> 03:06.751
That was my
                  favorite show.

03:06.818 --> 03:08.686
I really miss

03:08.754 --> 03:11.356
<i>Star Trek.</i>

03:13.058 --> 03:16.160
Well, actually,
  that wasn't even my network.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.061
But the point is is that...

03:17.129 --> 03:19.430
The only guy I didn't like

03:19.498 --> 03:21.832
was the leader
                of the Romulans.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.235
Well, you see...

03:24.337 --> 03:25.703
It wasn't the actor's fault.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.204
It was the script.

03:27.206 --> 03:31.009
They gave him things to say
that no Romulan would ever say.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.012
Right.

03:36.315 --> 03:39.150
Well, I guess you might
as well drive me home now.

03:39.218 --> 03:42.053
I-I live at Central Park West
and 68th...

03:45.223 --> 03:47.358
So...

03:47.426 --> 03:50.228
any, uh, new
                shows coming on?

03:50.296 --> 03:52.730
Oh, yeah, sure,
all the time.

03:52.798 --> 03:54.865
For instance, we're trying out
a couple tonight.

03:54.933 --> 03:56.734
Any good?

03:56.802 --> 03:59.471
Well, the first one
is very, very, very good.

03:59.538 --> 04:00.838
We're very excited
about it.

04:00.906 --> 04:03.541
It's-It's a special
one-hour presentation

04:03.609 --> 04:05.076
of <i>Hometown Girl.</i>

04:05.144 --> 04:07.812
That's our most popular
daytime soap opera.

04:07.879 --> 04:09.280
That one's a winner.

04:09.348 --> 04:11.416
Oh, what's the other one?

04:11.484 --> 04:12.783
That one's trouble.

04:12.851 --> 04:14.051
It's musical variety.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.255
Oh, oh, oh.
    I love musical variety.

04:18.322 --> 04:20.291
What is it?

04:20.392 --> 04:23.494
<i>The Pittsburgh Steelers</i>
         <i>at Marineland.</i>

04:23.596 --> 04:26.163
Oh. Oh.

04:26.231 --> 04:28.666
Would you mind
             hearing an opinion?

04:29.969 --> 04:31.569
You've got it backward.

04:31.637 --> 04:33.771
The marine show will win big.

04:33.839 --> 04:37.041
The soap opera
     will get clobbered...

04:37.108 --> 04:40.044
everywhere except Chicago.

04:42.347 --> 04:44.382
Were you ever in the business?

04:44.417 --> 04:47.319
No, I-I just have these hunches.

04:47.386 --> 04:48.787
For no reason at all,

04:48.854 --> 04:51.622
I'll suddenly see something
    happening in the future,

04:51.690 --> 04:53.123
and it usually comes true.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.326
Yeah, well,
 let's-let's make a deal, okay?

04:55.393 --> 04:57.294
You don't tell me
how to program television shows,

04:57.362 --> 04:58.396
and I won't tell you

04:58.463 --> 04:59.564
how to drive a cab, okay?

04:59.632 --> 05:00.831
Okay!
Okay.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.867
(horns honking)

05:04.169 --> 05:06.637
(horns honking loudly)

05:06.705 --> 05:07.839
Why are you heading

05:07.906 --> 05:09.807
into the exit
     of the Lincoln Tunnel?

05:09.874 --> 05:11.776
Oh, oh, oh!
              Remember our deal.

05:11.843 --> 05:13.778
(tires squealing,
     loud honking of horns)

05:21.120 --> 05:22.286
Does anyone happen to know

05:22.354 --> 05:24.822
why there's white powder
     all over Louie's cage?

05:24.890 --> 05:27.191
Oh, yeah, I bet
I know what that is.

05:27.259 --> 05:28.793
That's rat poison.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.129
It'll never work.

05:32.197 --> 05:34.733
He brings his own lunch.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.267
No, no.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.636
Louie's convinced that we
     have a mouse in the garage,

05:38.704 --> 05:41.005
so I-I bet he dusted
       his cage with that stuff.

05:41.073 --> 05:44.575
What's going on
here?

05:44.643 --> 05:48.012
Jim, we're trying to figure out
   what this white powder is.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.947
Oh.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.618
No, no, no, Jim!

05:54.687 --> 05:55.720
What?

05:55.788 --> 05:57.154
That could be
                     rat poison!

05:57.222 --> 06:00.257
Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.894
Nope. Flour.

06:03.962 --> 06:05.763
Flour?

06:05.831 --> 06:07.231
Hey! Get away from there!

06:07.299 --> 06:08.566
Don't touch anything!

06:08.634 --> 06:09.567
Oh?

06:09.635 --> 06:10.735
Aha!

06:10.803 --> 06:12.003
What?

06:12.070 --> 06:13.404
Just as I thought.

06:13.472 --> 06:14.305
What? What? What?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.807
My little plan worked.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.177
What does that look
like to you?

06:19.245 --> 06:21.211
A set of tiny
                     footprints!

06:21.279 --> 06:22.513
(laughs)

06:22.581 --> 06:24.282
And what does that tell you?

06:24.417 --> 06:26.584
You just had a dance lesson?

06:28.087 --> 06:30.154
We got a mouse, Reiger.

06:30.222 --> 06:31.255
A mouse!

06:31.323 --> 06:32.456
He walked
through the powder,

06:32.524 --> 06:34.592
and now he's tracking it
all over the garage.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.826
Well, well.

06:35.894 --> 06:38.396
His little footprints
are gonna lead me right to him.

06:38.464 --> 06:39.463
(laughs)

06:39.531 --> 06:41.399
ALEX:
The American sportsman
in action.

06:43.635 --> 06:45.470
I'm gonna find out
       where he's hiding.

06:45.537 --> 06:47.972
Then I'm gonna surround
   the place with mousetraps.

06:48.039 --> 06:51.376
As soon as that little sucker
        moves a muscle,

06:51.443 --> 06:53.277
Minnie's a widow.

06:53.345 --> 06:55.045
No, wait.

06:55.113 --> 06:56.481
Louie, come on!

06:56.548 --> 06:59.149
Come on, you're not gonna
      really set traps, are you?

06:59.217 --> 07:00.651
Traps are so cruel.

07:00.719 --> 07:03.387
Please, I hate to
             see even a helpless
            little mouse suffer.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.189
LOUIE:
                    Yeah, and as
                    soon as that

07:05.324 --> 07:08.392
helpless little mouse
scurries across the floor,

07:08.460 --> 07:10.094
you know who's gonna be

07:10.162 --> 07:11.563
standing on that table,

07:11.630 --> 07:13.565
screeching like a banshee,
           don't you?

07:13.632 --> 07:14.866
Maybe I would,

07:14.934 --> 07:16.968
but that still don't mean
you should kill it.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.070
He's back in there.

07:19.137 --> 07:20.371
(mutters)

07:20.439 --> 07:21.639
No. Wait.

07:21.707 --> 07:22.874
Louie?!

07:23.842 --> 07:26.777
No time for love, Nardo.

07:26.845 --> 07:29.647
I'm looking for a mouse here.

07:29.715 --> 07:33.751
Louie, you don't want to have
to spend money on traps, do you?

07:36.087 --> 07:38.189
If you let us catch
        the mouse alive,

07:38.257 --> 07:40.325
then not only have we saved
           his life,

07:40.392 --> 07:43.161
but we'll save you a couple
         of bucks, too.

07:46.031 --> 07:49.266
You always know how
           to appeal to my finer
               instincts, Nardo.

07:49.334 --> 07:50.601
All right, okay, go ahead.

07:50.669 --> 07:51.602
ELAINE:
Okay.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.037
You try it your way,

07:53.105 --> 07:55.806
but if you guys don't
    catch him pretty quick,

07:55.874 --> 07:58.408
little pink-eyes
           gets a metal necktie.

07:58.476 --> 08:00.911
Ee-ee-ee!

08:03.248 --> 08:05.183
Hi. Do you
                    remember me?

08:05.250 --> 08:06.817
I'm the guy
                  in television.

08:06.885 --> 08:08.719
Oh. Raymond Burr!

08:11.723 --> 08:14.759
No, no, no, I'm not...
           I'm not Raymond Burr.

08:14.826 --> 08:16.293
My name is
                   Mitch Harris.

08:16.361 --> 08:19.530
I'm the television
            executive you had in
            your cab last night.

08:19.598 --> 08:21.032
Oh, yeah?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.867
Uh, what can I do for you?

08:22.968 --> 08:24.535
I need your help
                    desperately.

08:24.602 --> 08:26.770
Everything that
                   you predicted

08:26.839 --> 08:28.672
about last night's
                shows came true.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.575
You were even right
                  about Chicago.

08:30.642 --> 08:32.243
Oh, it's no big deal.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.678
Yes, it is!

08:33.746 --> 08:37.582
What-What you did went against
all conventional wisdom.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.984
Oh, it's just some
            kind of crazy knack.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.654
Jim, I have to
ask you a favor.

08:42.721 --> 08:45.089
I want you to come
into my office

08:45.157 --> 08:47.424
and do what you did
last night in the cab.

08:47.492 --> 08:49.060
You know, just-just
tell me your hunches

08:49.128 --> 08:50.461
about television shows.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.062
My job is hanging
by a thread!

08:52.130 --> 08:54.565
I-I'm just asking
for a few hours of your time.

08:54.632 --> 08:57.334
It's been a
                   long-standing
                  policy with me

08:57.403 --> 09:00.304
to turn down any executive
        offers that came my way.

09:00.372 --> 09:02.206
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.880
Jim, if you had had this
chance a few years ago,

09:08.947 --> 09:11.181
you could have
saved <i>Star Trek.</i>

09:12.885 --> 09:14.819
Oh.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.087
<i>Star Trek!</i>

09:16.155 --> 09:17.922
Oh.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.157
What do you say, Jim?

09:20.225 --> 09:22.660
Shall we boldly go

09:22.727 --> 09:25.029
where no man has
               ever gone before?

09:29.101 --> 09:30.834
Louie,

09:30.936 --> 09:33.270
I need to take the rest
           of the afternoon off.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.072
I'm gonna go save television.

09:45.517 --> 09:47.751
MITCH:
          <i>See anything</i>
   <i>that impresses you so far?</i>

09:47.820 --> 09:49.020
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:49.088 --> 09:53.490
The one where the train
        smashed into those cars,

09:53.525 --> 09:55.426
and then the cars
            go through the house

09:55.494 --> 09:56.594
and over the cliff.

09:56.661 --> 09:57.895
Oh, you mean <i>Stunt Wife.</i>

09:57.962 --> 09:59.130
Yeah.

09:59.198 --> 10:01.832
Well, you pray for ideas
like that to come along.

10:04.469 --> 10:07.205
Ah, look, Jim,

10:07.272 --> 10:09.173
there's something
 that I haven't mentioned yet,

10:09.240 --> 10:10.641
but in case somebody walks in,

10:10.709 --> 10:12.977
I think we're gonna need
      an identity for you.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.178
Identity?

10:15.246 --> 10:17.281
Well, to explain
what you're doing here.

10:17.348 --> 10:19.350
You know, I mean,
      if people found out

10:19.417 --> 10:21.618
that I was basing my decisions
        on your hunches,

10:21.686 --> 10:24.322
it might not sit too well
      with the top brass.

10:24.389 --> 10:26.557
Let me see. Who could you be?

10:26.625 --> 10:28.593
No offense,
but you don't really look

10:28.660 --> 10:30.261
like my lawyer
or my accountant.

10:30.328 --> 10:33.898
Oh, I suppose
     a periodontist is out.

10:35.333 --> 10:38.235
Shoeshine! Perfect.

10:38.303 --> 10:41.538
I've got a brush and polish
      in this top drawer.

10:41.606 --> 10:43.273
If someone walks in
from upstairs,

10:43.341 --> 10:45.209
you came
to shine my shoes.

10:45.276 --> 10:46.811
Okay, Jim?

10:46.879 --> 10:49.981
It would really save a lot
of embarrassment, you know?

10:50.048 --> 10:51.983
Well, okay.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.350
I don't mind.

10:53.418 --> 10:54.585
Terrific!

10:54.652 --> 10:58.389
Okay, now let's take a look
       at this schedule.

10:58.456 --> 11:02.293
You see, Tuesday night is always
      the biggest problem.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.262
It has been for years.

11:04.329 --> 11:06.764
Excuse me,
                Mr. Harris.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.800
Oh, I'm, uh,
                    just looking
               over the schedule

11:09.868 --> 11:11.835
before I shine
                      his shoes.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.707
Okay, now these are the shows

11:16.742 --> 11:18.675
that we're considering
         for Tuesday night, Jim.

11:19.811 --> 11:22.747
(clicking)

11:22.814 --> 11:24.381
MAN (on TV):
       What's the matter?

11:24.449 --> 11:26.083
You never seen one
        of these before?

11:26.151 --> 11:28.118
(canned laughter)

11:31.156 --> 11:32.823
WOMAN (on TV):
    Yeah, but under the bed.

11:32.891 --> 11:34.291
Not on your head.

11:34.359 --> 11:35.793
(canned laughter)

11:35.861 --> 11:37.828
(applause)

11:39.564 --> 11:40.798
Comedy.

11:40.865 --> 11:43.100
Oh, oh, oh.

11:43.168 --> 11:44.335
(laughs)

11:47.372 --> 11:50.107
And here's-here's a game show
that tested very well.

11:50.175 --> 11:51.943
It's kind of
an updated version

11:52.010 --> 11:54.611
of <i>Truth or Consequences</i>
with celebrity contestants.

11:54.679 --> 11:56.613
MAN (on TV):
 All right, if you guess right,

11:56.681 --> 11:59.616
you'll move one step closer
     to the giant jackpot.

11:59.684 --> 12:01.618
But if you guess wrong,

12:01.686 --> 12:04.554
well, you know what happens
   to your celebrity partner.

12:04.622 --> 12:06.623
(laughter)

12:09.594 --> 12:12.529
What's in that big tank
         over Paul Lynde's head?

12:12.597 --> 12:14.365
Melted cheese.

12:14.432 --> 12:15.299
(sputters)

12:15.366 --> 12:18.336
This is great!

12:18.403 --> 12:21.205
Yeah, it is--
it is great.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.707
We kind of see it, though,
as a summer replacement.

12:23.775 --> 12:25.709
This is a winner!

12:25.777 --> 12:27.644
I'm sure!

12:27.712 --> 12:29.713
(grunts)

12:32.017 --> 12:34.084
Well, yeah--

12:34.186 --> 12:37.454
the problem would be, I guess,
       where to place it.

12:37.489 --> 12:40.457
Maybe Tuesday...

12:40.526 --> 12:42.259
Hold it!
                        Hold it!

12:42.326 --> 12:44.061
Uh, hunch, hunch.

12:46.532 --> 12:47.532
Friday!

12:47.599 --> 12:49.433
Friday?

12:49.535 --> 12:51.435
Uh...

12:51.537 --> 12:54.872
well, maybe Friday at 8:00?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.173
Uh, 9:00!

12:56.208 --> 12:57.941
9:00?

12:58.043 --> 12:59.943
At 9:00 on Friday

13:00.012 --> 13:02.980
the competition has
     a new James Bond movie

13:03.048 --> 13:05.816
and <i>Brooke Shields Turns 17.</i>

13:07.485 --> 13:09.786
You want to put a game show
       on opposite that?

13:09.854 --> 13:11.722
I'm just tellin' you my hunch.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.092
I've got a crazy feeling
      it could win there.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.466
9:00 on Friday?

13:22.534 --> 13:24.235
(mutters):
               Don't-don't talk.

13:29.174 --> 13:30.608
I can't believe

13:30.676 --> 13:32.443
that I'm letting a cabdriver
off the street

13:32.511 --> 13:33.611
do my job for me.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.613
Hey, don't feel bad.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.482
If you could do your
                 job, you would!

13:54.799 --> 13:56.734
Okay, I've got
the mousetrap.

13:56.801 --> 13:58.335
Jason finished it
this morning.

13:58.403 --> 13:59.604
Wow!

13:59.671 --> 14:02.106
That's an impressive little
   device your son cooked up.

14:02.173 --> 14:03.674
Yeah, it looks slick.

14:03.742 --> 14:06.177
But I don't think it's
                     gonna work.

14:06.244 --> 14:08.746
I mean, no mouse is
            gonna be dumb enough

14:08.814 --> 14:10.948
to walk right
                      up in here

14:11.016 --> 14:12.783
and get himself caught.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.122
Don't get encouraged, Nardo.

14:19.190 --> 14:22.860
Just because Banta fell for it,
   doesn't mean a mouse will.

14:22.928 --> 14:23.961
(phone ringing)

14:23.996 --> 14:25.862
Hello.

14:25.964 --> 14:27.064
Yeah, just a minute.

14:27.131 --> 14:28.198
Jim, telephone.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.400
It's right there in your hand.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.103
Jim!

14:33.171 --> 14:34.405
Huh?

14:34.473 --> 14:36.941
It's a phone call for you!

14:37.008 --> 14:38.342
The guy at the network.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.311
Oh, yeah.

14:43.882 --> 14:46.817
Hi, Mitch, how's it goin'?

14:46.885 --> 14:49.086
We did?

14:49.154 --> 14:51.855
Wow, that's terrific!

14:51.923 --> 14:54.858
You're welcome.

14:54.926 --> 14:57.361
If you can't tell me
how happy you are,

14:57.429 --> 15:00.364
why did you call?

15:00.432 --> 15:02.699
(mumbling)

15:02.767 --> 15:04.201
Okay, yeah.

15:04.269 --> 15:07.204
I'll-I'll drop by later
this afternoon.

15:07.272 --> 15:08.905
Okay.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.207
(sighs)

15:10.242 --> 15:11.342
Jim, what happened?
                        Tell us.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.477
The network won Friday night
in the ratings

15:13.545 --> 15:15.546
for the first time
in two years.

15:15.614 --> 15:16.948
ELAINE:
           Oh, that's wonderful.

15:17.015 --> 15:18.182
TONY:
             I can't believe it.

15:18.250 --> 15:18.915
You're kidding me!

15:19.051 --> 15:20.917
Oh, do you know
        what this means?

15:20.986 --> 15:23.320
This means you're gonna be
   a big shot at the network.

15:23.388 --> 15:25.722
I mean, you're gonna have an
 office and an expense account.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.124
This is your ticket
                outta here, Jim.

15:27.191 --> 15:29.393
Oh, they must be paying you
           a fortune.
                            Ooh!

15:29.461 --> 15:31.928
Uh, well, "fortune" is
a relative term.

15:32.030 --> 15:33.364
Well, how much are
        they paying you?

15:33.431 --> 15:35.466
Nothing.

15:37.468 --> 15:38.835
But what are they
                  doing for you?

15:38.903 --> 15:40.237
Nothing.

15:40.305 --> 15:42.573
Uh, as a matter of fact,

15:42.641 --> 15:46.109
they treat me like
        a shoeshine boy.

15:46.211 --> 15:47.310
Why?

15:47.346 --> 15:49.646
Well, it's probably
         my own fault.

15:49.681 --> 15:52.583
While I'm there,
    I shine the guy's shoes.

15:54.085 --> 15:56.420
Jim, this is ridiculous.

15:56.488 --> 15:57.954
You're being taken advantage of.

15:58.022 --> 15:59.490
That guy's gonna get
         all the credit

15:59.558 --> 16:01.425
and you're not gonna get
    any recognition at all.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.427
Hey, it's thanks enough to me

16:03.495 --> 16:06.096
that he's walking around
with a nice shine on his shoes.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.034
Every time he
gets a compliment
on his shoes,

16:11.103 --> 16:12.802
it reflects on me.
Jim!

16:12.870 --> 16:14.638
I'm not talkin'
about shoes!

16:14.705 --> 16:16.707
God, sometimes
you can infuriate me,

16:16.774 --> 16:17.874
you know that?

16:17.942 --> 16:19.376
ELAINE:
              Oh, wait a minute,
                           Alex.

16:19.444 --> 16:20.777
What are you getting
so upset about?

16:20.845 --> 16:21.912
It's not his fault.

16:21.979 --> 16:24.448
Yes, it is his
                  fault, Elaine.

16:24.516 --> 16:28.885
Some people in this world
        make themselves victims,
         and Jim is one of them.

16:29.021 --> 16:32.189
People who invite other people
          to walk all over them.

16:32.257 --> 16:33.924
He's letting that guy
              walk all over him.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.826
Wait a minute, Alex.

16:35.927 --> 16:36.827
What can I do?

16:36.895 --> 16:38.496
How can I change?
            Help me.

16:38.563 --> 16:40.163
Jim, there's only
                    one person--

16:40.232 --> 16:42.999
there's only one person in this
         life that can help you.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.568
There's only one person
                  you can trust.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.036
I do trust you, Alex.

16:46.104 --> 16:47.471
Not me, damn it!

16:47.538 --> 16:50.374
Jim, when do you finally stand
         up and assert yourself?

16:50.409 --> 16:52.976
August.

16:53.044 --> 16:54.611
August?!

16:54.679 --> 16:56.446
Wrong answer.
You say when.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.115
Now, Jim, now!

16:58.183 --> 17:00.951
Start standing up for
             yourself right now!

17:01.019 --> 17:03.954
You have dignity and value
                as a human being

17:04.021 --> 17:06.257
and it's high time that that
           Mitch person knew it.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.557
Dignity?
                            Yes!

17:07.625 --> 17:08.692
Value?
                   That's right.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.060
Thank you, Alex.

17:10.127 --> 17:13.130
This little conversation has
   been an eye-opener for me.

17:13.231 --> 17:14.698
If you'll excuse me,

17:14.765 --> 17:16.700
I'm gonna go have a little talk

17:16.767 --> 17:18.736
with that old buddy of mine,
             Mitch.
                           Good!

17:18.803 --> 17:21.472
About a little thing
     called human dignity.

17:21.539 --> 17:22.705
Attaboy, Jim.

17:30.915 --> 17:32.015
(grunts)

17:41.526 --> 17:42.660
Hi, Jim.

17:42.727 --> 17:44.728
Don't give me that.

17:46.431 --> 17:48.766
I've got a little news
for you, Mitch.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.703
I'm not gonna be shining
shoes anymore.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.671
And not just because
        I'm outta black.

17:54.739 --> 17:56.306
It's more than just that.

17:56.374 --> 17:57.841
It's a lot more.

17:57.909 --> 18:00.977
It's got to do with a little
  thing called human dignity.

18:01.045 --> 18:03.113
You ever heard of that, Mitch?

18:03.181 --> 18:05.048
I've been doing your
work for you.

18:05.116 --> 18:06.816
You've been taking
all the credit.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.654
Jim, you're right.

18:12.724 --> 18:15.926
The only explanation I can give
       you is that I was afraid.

18:15.993 --> 18:18.195
I was afraid that if
                 they found out,

18:18.262 --> 18:19.630
I'd-I'd lose my job.

18:19.698 --> 18:21.698
And I know that's
                      no excuse,

18:21.766 --> 18:24.101
Jim, but I wasn't just
             thinking of myself.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.337
I was thinking of them.

18:28.206 --> 18:30.106
You know them?

18:30.208 --> 18:32.108
Yes, Jim.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.643
These are my children,

18:33.712 --> 18:35.913
Arlene, Bennet
                    and Dorothy.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.647
Boy,

18:37.682 --> 18:40.183
I bet they say some
cute things.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.618
They do.
Like what?

18:41.686 --> 18:43.320
Well, I can't think of
                 anything now...

18:43.388 --> 18:45.822
Well, I'll take
your word for it.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.092
You know, maybe it would
               be good for them.

18:48.159 --> 18:50.160
Maybe it'd be good
                   for all of us

18:50.262 --> 18:52.596
to cut back a little bit,
      not have it so soft.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.531
Oh, that would be terrible.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.300
Bennet's gonna
need braces.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.101
No, no...

18:58.169 --> 19:00.604
don't-don't try to talk
              me out of it, Jim.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.439
My mind's made up.

19:02.507 --> 19:04.941
Mitch, they're having a victory
party down the hall.

19:05.009 --> 19:06.943
Everybody's asking
for you, so come on.

19:07.011 --> 19:08.945
No, no, Janine,
                come in, please.

19:09.013 --> 19:10.947
I have something
                    to tell you.

19:11.015 --> 19:13.551
I had nothing to do
              with the schedule.

19:14.586 --> 19:17.588
That man is the one
        who did it all.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.524
Jim, here, is
     a programming genius.

19:20.592 --> 19:24.461
Well, I guess the cat's
         outta the bag.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.434
Mitch, they're waiting
for us at the party.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.835
I can't go

19:31.903 --> 19:33.804
up there and take credit
   for something that he did.

19:33.871 --> 19:35.072
Oh, Mitch,
all of us here

19:35.140 --> 19:36.740
are always asking
people's opinions

19:36.775 --> 19:37.941
about television.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.776
All our friends,
our lovers,

19:39.844 --> 19:41.111
the man on the street,

19:41.179 --> 19:43.046
even the shoeshine boy.

19:43.114 --> 19:45.982
I've gotten advice,
       darn good advice,

19:46.050 --> 19:47.651
from my hairdresser.

19:47.719 --> 19:50.687
My nephews picked
      our 6:00 news team.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.523
Now, what does it matter
           in the final analysis

19:53.625 --> 19:54.825
how we arrived at
                  those choices?

19:54.893 --> 19:55.926
The point is

19:56.061 --> 19:57.894
we made the final decisions

19:57.963 --> 19:59.896
and we stuck to them.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.898
Now I'm going to that party.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.567
The champagne's getting warm.

20:03.634 --> 20:05.569
It was nice meeting you.

20:05.636 --> 20:07.538
I'll see you at the party,
             Mitch.

20:07.605 --> 20:10.541
Yeah, I'll-I'll see you
at the party.

20:10.608 --> 20:12.142
JIM:
I love

20:12.209 --> 20:13.477
champagne.
                            Jim!

20:13.545 --> 20:15.445
Uh... Jim!

20:15.513 --> 20:17.147
And-and do they
have shrimp?
                     Jim? Jim...

20:17.215 --> 20:18.682
Those-- I love those
big shrimp.
                         Right.

20:18.749 --> 20:20.384
Yeah, Jim, you know,
                and I'd-I'd love

20:20.452 --> 20:22.218
to invite you
                   to the party,

20:22.320 --> 20:25.289
but I-I think it would be
            a little bit awkward

20:25.356 --> 20:27.490
having you there.

20:28.326 --> 20:30.060
You understand?

20:30.128 --> 20:32.495
Uh... yeah...

20:32.563 --> 20:34.497
You sure?
          I guess so.

20:35.566 --> 20:37.500
Sure.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.075
But-but listen,

20:45.143 --> 20:48.111
first thing Monday morning
       I'm gonna talk to someone

20:48.179 --> 20:49.913
about getting you an
            office and a salary.

20:49.981 --> 20:51.915
No, no, no, no, I...

20:51.983 --> 20:55.352
I can't accept any money.

20:55.419 --> 20:58.689
I just wouldn't feel right.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.693
My ability to see glimpses of
 the future is a gift from God

21:02.761 --> 21:06.697
and I refuse to abuse it

21:06.765 --> 21:09.366
or taint it

21:09.434 --> 21:13.003
by using it for financial gain.

21:14.405 --> 21:17.073
Well, Jim, if that's
                 how you feel...

21:17.141 --> 21:20.811
Uh, you can pay me
for the shoe shine.

21:20.879 --> 21:22.913
How much do I owe you?

21:22.947 --> 21:26.583
$150,000.

21:38.863 --> 21:41.598
(bells ringing)

21:52.443 --> 21:54.711
Aha!

21:54.779 --> 21:57.681
Uh-huh!

22:00.618 --> 22:03.153
At last we meet!

22:03.221 --> 22:05.155
Uh-huh!

22:09.327 --> 22:11.995
What to do, what to do...

22:17.035 --> 22:20.103
I could flush you.

22:20.171 --> 22:23.507
Send you bodysurfing
        down the tubes.

22:25.042 --> 22:27.978
A little sewer snack
      for some alligator.

22:31.182 --> 22:34.118
I could leave you in this jar

22:34.185 --> 22:36.120
for another 15 minutes.

22:36.187 --> 22:38.055
(mimics gasping)

22:43.828 --> 22:46.496
Just my luck you're a baby.

22:46.564 --> 22:48.365
All right,

22:48.433 --> 22:50.367
I'll give ya a fair chance.

22:50.435 --> 22:53.036
Heads, I set you free.

22:53.104 --> 22:56.206
Tails, you're a dead mouse.

22:56.274 --> 22:57.007
Ready?

22:57.075 --> 22:58.741
Huh? Huh?

22:58.809 --> 23:00.410
Here, look here.

23:00.478 --> 23:02.412
Huh? Huh? Huh?

23:05.583 --> 23:06.683
Tails!

23:06.750 --> 23:08.652
Surf's up!

23:12.223 --> 23:14.424
Nah, I was only kiddin'.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.359
It's heads.

23:15.426 --> 23:17.193
Look, look.

23:17.228 --> 23:18.961
All right, all right,
        get outta here.

23:19.029 --> 23:20.897
Go on.

23:20.965 --> 23:23.900
Get outta my garage.

23:23.968 --> 23:25.902
Go on, go on.

23:25.970 --> 23:28.071
(laughs)

23:32.110 --> 23:35.012
(theme song playing)

23:57.802 --> 23:59.102
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:59.170 --> 24:00.170
(man grumbling)
