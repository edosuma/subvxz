00:13.047 --> 00:14.513
- [Josh] I don't
know where to start.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.482
(children chattering)

00:16.484 --> 00:18.050
I do know you wouldn't
be proud of me,

00:18.052 --> 00:20.753
but I need you to
know that I tried.

00:20.755 --> 00:21.653
(intercom rings)

00:21.655 --> 00:23.122
- [Nurse] Paging Dr. Grant,

00:23.124 --> 00:24.656
Dr. Grant, please
report to the ER,

00:24.658 --> 00:26.759
Dr. Grant to the ER.

00:26.761 --> 00:29.428
- I didn't wanna be
in this situation.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.629
I didn't pick it.

00:30.631 --> 00:34.066
I mean, I just
did what I, I did,

00:34.068 --> 00:35.434
doesn't make it wrong.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.637
Sometimes, we make decisions

00:38.639 --> 00:40.639
that people don't understand,
(Josh yells)

00:40.641 --> 00:42.041
because they weren't there.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.444
I didn't wanna be
in this situation.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.579
(Josh yells)
I didn't pick it.

00:48.749 --> 00:49.681
That's what they all say,

00:49.683 --> 00:52.518
'cause no one can
be bothered to help.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.220
Why don't you have any money?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.755
I bet you do.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.791
I bet you do, and you just
don't care if I die, right?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.094
- Please, ma'am.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.195
Can you just stop?

01:03.197 --> 01:04.763
Can you just not talk so loud?

01:06.267 --> 01:09.401
(solemn music)

01:09.403 --> 01:11.103
- I've been here for so long,

01:11.105 --> 01:13.705
and no one cares
about me (laughs).

01:13.707 --> 01:14.740
(dramatic music)

01:14.742 --> 01:17.309
Walking back and forth,

01:17.311 --> 01:18.577
I didn't pick this.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.613
I mean, I just did
what I had to do.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.316
Doesn't make it wrong, right?
(electricity crackling)

01:24.318 --> 01:27.352
People don't understand,
because they weren't there,

01:27.354 --> 01:29.488
because none of
us gets a do over,

01:29.490 --> 01:31.190
no point talkin' about it.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.124
- What are you doing?

01:32.126 --> 01:34.760
- It's just what is.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.595
- What are you doing?

01:37.465 --> 01:38.597
What are you doing, stop!

01:38.599 --> 01:39.865
Nurse, nurse!

01:39.867 --> 01:41.633
Please, ma'am.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.801
Stop, stop.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.670
(eerie music)

01:44.672 --> 01:45.737
Stop.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.141
(intercom beeps)

01:49.143 --> 01:49.875
- [Announcer] This
is a code blue.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.544
This is a code blue.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.179
- I'll never be normal.

01:55.549 --> 01:59.751
- Nurse, nurse! They're
bleeding! (echoes)

02:01.555 --> 02:03.722
Nurse, nurse!
- Code blue, code blue.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.325
- [Woman] I'll never be normal.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.159
(people screaming)

02:07.161 --> 02:08.827
I just want it to end.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.395
(electricity crackling)

02:10.397 --> 02:11.730
Make it stop.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.766
(dramatic music)

02:21.742 --> 02:22.774
(bell ringing)

02:22.776 --> 02:25.611
(solemn music)

03:35.716 --> 03:37.816
- I hate that I let you down.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.589
But then again, you're
not here, are you?

03:43.591 --> 03:46.425
(dramatic music)

03:52.399 --> 03:55.300
(chains clinking)

03:57.972 --> 04:01.707
- [Mason] I'm sorry,
Father, for I have sinned.

04:01.709 --> 04:05.444
I have laid my hands
on a man of cloth.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.912
But why should I confess to you?

04:08.282 --> 04:09.815
Why not talk to God myself

04:09.817 --> 04:12.651
and cut out the middleman?

04:15.723 --> 04:19.591
- God's (gasps), God's people,

04:20.761 --> 04:21.994
when they were wandering
through the desert,

04:21.996 --> 04:23.862
asked the same question (gasps).

04:26.600 --> 04:30.535
But when God spoke to
him, they were so afraid,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.573
so they asked Moses to
speak on their behalf.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.846
Most people don't
want to hear from God.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.584
They don't like
what he has to say.

04:47.021 --> 04:51.657
- [Mason] Oh, I'm not
here to talk to God.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.893
I've come to talk to you.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.866
You've tried so
hard to protect them

05:01.935 --> 05:03.735
but I have searched

05:03.737 --> 05:08.040
for a very long time.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.044
What was that they used

05:12.046 --> 05:13.879
to call them?

05:13.881 --> 05:16.381
Freaks?

05:16.383 --> 05:18.717
Demons?

05:18.719 --> 05:21.320
Possessed?

05:21.322 --> 05:22.554
- Who are you?

05:27.428 --> 05:29.861
(priest gasps)

05:32.499 --> 05:35.701
- [Mason] I'm just a
man searching for truth.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.873
- I don't see a man.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.911
I see an angry boy
hiding in a mask.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.787
(Mason grunts)
(knife clinks)

05:55.789 --> 05:58.423
(somber music)

05:59.727 --> 06:01.860
(priest gasping)

06:01.862 --> 06:03.128
(Mason grunts)

06:03.130 --> 06:05.831
- [Mason] Who will
protect them now?

06:05.833 --> 06:08.100
(clock ticking)

06:08.102 --> 06:10.836
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

06:10.838 --> 06:13.538
(door thuds)

06:25.986 --> 06:27.719
- [Josh] How you doing, Emma?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.457
- I did it again.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.129
- [Josh] Yeah, I know.

06:40.768 --> 06:41.666
- [Emma] Josh?

06:42.536 --> 06:43.435
- Yeah.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.772
- I can't do this,

06:47.908 --> 06:50.876
this place, these
walls, this food.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.747
I want to go home.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.850
- I know you do.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.754
I know this is hard,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.956
(tone whining)
but you need to trust me.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.758
This is what we
need to do for now.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.927
I'm trying to pull some--

07:08.929 --> 07:13.865
(electricity crackling)
(ground rumbling)

07:15.436 --> 07:16.868
- [Emma] He's lying to you.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.937
He's lying to you.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.772
- This isn't forever.
- You don't want to be there.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.107
No.

07:22.109 --> 07:22.941
- It's just for a season.
- He's lying.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.842
No.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.778
(gasps) I wanna go home.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.482
- [Josh] Emma, Emma, you
need to stay in control.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.216
(Emma sobbing)

07:31.218 --> 07:32.984
- [Emma] Please stay, I can't.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.821
- Don't lose control.
- I can do better.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.088
- [Josh] Emma, Emma.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.824
- [Emma] I can do better!

07:38.826 --> 07:40.091
- Please, Emma.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.762
Please just trust me, I
need you to stay calm.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.764
Emma--
- I can do better.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.765
- I need you, I need
you to stay calm, Emma.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.068
Stay in control, Emma.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.937
Emma, Emma.
- I can do better!

07:51.939 --> 07:54.039
I can do better.
- Listen to me, Emma,

07:54.041 --> 07:56.808
I need you to stay calm.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.643
- I can do better.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.613
(cup clatters)

08:01.615 --> 08:03.882
I can do better.
- Emma, please.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.617
- I can do better.

08:05.619 --> 08:09.888
Please, Josh (sobbing), please.

08:09.890 --> 08:14.960
(Emma sobbing)
(dramatic music)

08:17.764 --> 08:19.998
(Emma panting)

08:20.000 --> 08:22.934
(clock ticking)

08:39.753 --> 08:42.554
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

08:42.556 --> 08:43.788
(door thuds)

08:43.790 --> 08:44.856
- Let's get you
back to your bed.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.994
(Emma panting)

08:56.970 --> 08:59.838
(somber music)

09:12.819 --> 09:14.986
- I'm out of black paint.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.656
- I'll get you some more.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.764
- I didn't mean to break it.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.732
- It's okay.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.600
I'll fix it.

09:38.845 --> 09:43.915
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

09:44.618 --> 09:46.851
(door thuds)

09:55.662 --> 09:56.361
- I told you.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.196
She's getting worse.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.898
I doubled her dosage.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.134
It's what's causing
the nosebleeds.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.303
- Did you notice she's
out of black paint?

10:07.074 --> 10:08.873
- What?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.309
- If you didn't even notice
she's out of black paint,

10:11.311 --> 10:13.244
that makes me wonder
what else you're missing.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.947
If something so
simple can get by you,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.049
how can I trust you
to help my sister?

10:21.722 --> 10:23.788
- I can't, okay?

10:23.790 --> 10:24.889
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.925
I'm trying to, but I can't.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.331
(Doug sighs)

10:33.333 --> 10:36.301
Listen, this was
only supposed to be

10:36.303 --> 10:39.304
for a couple of weeks,
and I've done everything.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.950
There's someone I
want you to meet.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.919
He's a specialist.

10:54.921 --> 10:55.887
I think he can help.
- No.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.190
No, no, you stick to the plan.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.793
You keep her safe.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.728
You find a new
drug to sedate her,

11:03.730 --> 11:05.380
and you fix her, all right.

11:05.381 --> 11:07.031
I'm not letting anyone
mess with her head.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.968
(electricity crackling)

11:09.970 --> 11:13.004
When people find
out what she can do,

11:13.006 --> 11:14.973
they're not interested
in helping her.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.913
So do your job and get
her some new paint.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.382
(solemn music)

11:32.292 --> 11:35.026
(ominous music)

11:41.835 --> 11:44.836
(dramatic music)

11:46.807 --> 11:49.908
Do you believe in angels?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.242
(gentle music)

11:51.244 --> 11:52.277
- Yes, I do.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.482
- Then you believe
in demons too.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.494
- I don't believe your
sister's possessed.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.396
- I've heard people talking.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.399
(voice whispering)

12:17.804 --> 12:21.239
- I've never seen a demon,
but I believe they exist.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.177
I also believe
people use that word

12:25.178 --> 12:27.479
to describe things they don't
understand or are afraid of.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.017
- My dad told me I
needed to protect her.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.487
- I'm so sorry.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.859
Things are gonna be really
difficult, from now on,

12:42.763 --> 12:43.995
but you'll have each other.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.831
That means more
than you realize.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.368
Your dad left her in good hands.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.438
Let's go.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.074
(solemn music)

13:02.315 --> 13:05.116
- [Josh] I'll be the first to
admit I have an anger issue.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.785
(fists thudding)

13:06.787 --> 13:10.221
I can't remember what it's
like to not feel this way,

13:10.223 --> 13:14.025
to live a normal life,
worry about normal things.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.962
They say that the first
step is acknowledging

13:17.964 --> 13:20.965
you have a problem
and then owning it.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.536
Right, well, here's the thing.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.138
It's not entirely my fault.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.509
(solemn music)

13:33.180 --> 13:35.280
(fist thuds)

13:35.282 --> 13:38.082
(static hissing)

13:43.990 --> 13:46.558
(object clacking)
(suspenseful music)

13:46.560 --> 13:49.561
(voice whispering)

13:53.834 --> 13:57.569
¶ This little light of mine ¶

13:57.571 --> 14:01.005
¶ I'm gonna let it shine ¶

14:01.007 --> 14:02.574
(voice whispering)

14:02.576 --> 14:05.510
- [Emma] You can't
hide her forever, Josh.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.513
Somebody is going to
come looking for her,

14:08.515 --> 14:10.348
and then it will be too late.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.449
(knife clinks)

14:11.451 --> 14:14.085
(Josh gasping)

14:16.056 --> 14:18.523
And then it will be too late,

14:27.200 --> 14:30.001
- [Josh] It's getting worse.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.903
I can't tell what's
real anymore.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.505
It's not just in my dreams.

14:34.507 --> 14:38.109
It's like, like I'm
living a nightmare.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.979
(gentle music)

14:42.249 --> 14:44.549
(bird squawks)

14:44.551 --> 14:47.352
(engine rumbles)

14:52.392 --> 14:55.226
(car door thuds)

15:08.642 --> 15:12.443
- You know, Josh, we're
gonna need some more.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.045
It's not for me.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.448
I have to pay some colleagues
to unsee some stuff.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.652
- You understand this
isn't easy to come by.

15:20.654 --> 15:21.653
- They think I'm trying
to make a quick buck,

15:21.655 --> 15:22.587
and they want in.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.359
- Fine, just let 'em think that.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.260
- Okay, good.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.031
- When are you done?

15:33.033 --> 15:36.000
- Soon, a couple of
hours, two hours?

15:36.002 --> 15:36.701
Yeah, two hours.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.671
Are you going to see her?

15:39.673 --> 15:41.239
She had a rough
night, last night.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.546
(motorcycle revs)

15:57.157 --> 16:00.158
- [Josh] You said Dad
left her in good hands.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.993
I doubt you'd still say that.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.529
I wanna change it.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.631
I try to change it.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.101
But it still stays the same,

16:10.103 --> 16:12.971
over and over and over.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.672
- Uh, do you have any change?

16:15.709 --> 16:17.508
I forgot money for the dryer.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.545
- Oh, sorry, I don't
have any cash on me.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.147
- We're in a laundromat.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.752
You can't do your laundry if
you don't have any change.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.322
You know what?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.757
Forget it.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.125
(door squeaks)

16:34.127 --> 16:35.326
(door clacks)

16:35.328 --> 16:37.628
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I got some change.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.030
Now the question is, though,

16:39.032 --> 16:40.999
what are you willing
to do for it?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.634
I guess you used
up all your tips.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.137
That right?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.205
Hey, ah, ow!

16:48.341 --> 16:50.708
You used to be gentle.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.477
Hey, I was just trying to
talk to you, sweetheart.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.678
I miss you, you know.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.017
Hey!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.053
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.221
Hey, just calm down.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.124
(motorcycle revs)

17:09.429 --> 17:12.163
(ominous music)

17:14.768 --> 17:17.101
Don't test me, now give me --

17:17.103 --> 17:18.403
Give me the basket, come on.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.805
- Let go.
- No, you --

17:20.807 --> 17:23.274
- [Josh] I think you
should leave her alone.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.345
- Just ignore it.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.280
That voice inside your
head that's telling you

17:29.282 --> 17:31.716
to be a hero is
gonna get you hurt.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.618
- You okay?

17:34.788 --> 17:35.753
- She's fine.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.190
Now why don't you turn
around and get outta here

17:39.192 --> 17:41.459
before you wake up
in a hospital bed.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.496
- It would've been a lot
simpler if I'd just listened.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.601
Let's just say things
got off to a rough start.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.237
(Derek grunts)

17:54.674 --> 17:57.442
- (laughs) You weren't
ready for that one.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.342
Try again.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.848
(Derek grunts)
- Derek!

18:03.850 --> 18:04.849
- You stay outta this.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.517
- Come on.
(Derek grunting)

18:06.519 --> 18:07.418
- Stop it!

18:08.354 --> 18:09.253
- Come on!

18:10.790 --> 18:12.757
Come on!
(Derek yells)

18:12.759 --> 18:14.525
Is that all you got?

18:14.527 --> 18:16.694
Come on, come on, hit me!

18:18.765 --> 18:19.664
Hit me!

18:21.367 --> 18:23.468
(tone whining)

18:23.470 --> 18:27.271
- Give her back the bunny now!

18:27.273 --> 18:28.506
Give her back the bunny now!

18:28.508 --> 18:29.707
- Hit me!

18:29.709 --> 18:30.842
(Derek yells)

18:30.844 --> 18:33.277
Is that all you got?
- It's cool, man.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.213
- [Priest] I don't believe
your sister's possessed.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.547
- [Derek] Something's
wrong with you, man.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.815
Come on!

18:37.817 --> 18:40.518
- [Man] Give her
back the bunny now!

18:40.520 --> 18:43.254
(intense music)

18:52.365 --> 18:55.199
(dramatic music)

18:56.903 --> 18:58.603
- I wish it wasn't a dream.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.572
I wish...

19:05.311 --> 19:08.179
Like I said, you
wouldn't be proud of me.

19:08.181 --> 19:11.849
(pager buzzing)
(solemn music)

19:11.851 --> 19:14.819
(birds twittering)

19:32.805 --> 19:36.807
- How long have you been
from, um, around here?

19:38.211 --> 19:38.910
- Too long.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.681
(pager buzzing)

19:45.251 --> 19:45.950
Shit.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.522
Is she okay?

19:55.495 --> 19:55.960
- No.

19:55.961 --> 19:56.426
I found her passed out in there,

19:56.429 --> 19:57.461
at like four in the morning.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.431
I don't have answers.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.333
But she thinks you've
abandoned her here.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.537
- She thinks I've
abandoned her, or do you?

20:09.842 --> 20:12.543
Everything I do is for her.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.246
Every choice I make,
every sacrifice,

20:15.248 --> 20:17.281
I make it to protect her.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.550
So what else do
you want me to do?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.652
- Get her real help, Josh.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.754
Okay, talk to someone
who knows her condition.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.690
- No, no, no, we have
been through this.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.594
- Yes, we, yes, we've
been through this.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.861
But that doesn't change the fact

20:30.863 --> 20:32.997
that these are not the answers.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.931
(syringes clatter)

20:33.933 --> 20:35.333
Okay, this isn't the solution.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.702
(syringe clatters)

20:37.704 --> 20:38.769
Listen, I know a guy--

20:38.771 --> 20:39.804
- No.
- And he's--

20:39.806 --> 20:40.705
- Not with my sister.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.407
- Josh, what your sister
needs is for you--

20:43.409 --> 20:45.810
- No, no, what she
needs is for me

20:45.812 --> 20:47.411
to protect her, all right?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.580
So I'll make this clear.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.984
I don't want anyone
poking around in her head.

20:52.986 --> 20:53.851
- Stop it.

20:55.788 --> 20:56.854
Okay.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.496
(Doug coughs)

21:05.498 --> 21:06.464
You have one week.

21:07.834 --> 21:08.733
- [Josh] What?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.803
- She's having an episode
almost every day now,

21:12.805 --> 21:14.772
and I've run out of options.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.841
- No, I pay you to
do whatever you can--

21:16.843 --> 21:18.909
- No, no, you're
paying me to hide her.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.047
And I'm not gonna
sit around anymore

21:23.049 --> 21:25.683
and watch her die, because
you're too stubborn

21:26.552 --> 21:28.386
or too afraid to
do what's right.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.423
Now you either get her
the help that she needs,

21:32.425 --> 21:34.792
or you find another
place to bury her.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.827
- And what's that
supposed to mean?

21:38.431 --> 21:40.598
- We always hurt the
ones that we love, Josh.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.303
And you love your sister a lot.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.039
(solemn music)

21:48.041 --> 21:51.742
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

21:51.744 --> 21:55.579
(charcoal scratching)

21:55.581 --> 21:58.082
(clock ticking)

22:09.395 --> 22:10.761
- I asked him not to tell you.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.467
- Yeah, I know.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.487
- Thanks.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.059
- How'd you sleep?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.468
- Why don't you want to
talk to another doctor?

22:52.138 --> 22:53.637
We can trust Doug, right?

22:57.710 --> 22:58.609
He's family.

22:58.610 --> 22:59.509
- It's not that simple, Em.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.912
We have to be
careful, even in here.

23:04.650 --> 23:07.485
(both sigh)

23:07.487 --> 23:09.720
Do you remember when
we were little kids?

23:09.722 --> 23:12.390
And we read Dad's story
about the paratroopers?

23:12.392 --> 23:15.025
And I took one of my bedsheets,
and I made a parachute,

23:15.027 --> 23:17.027
and I climbed the tallest
tree in our forest,

23:17.029 --> 23:18.462
and I jumped out of it.

23:20.933 --> 23:21.832
I felt like I hit every
branch on the way down.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.003
- I remember.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.808
- And you dragged
me out of the forest

23:30.810 --> 23:35.446
in your old, squeaky red
wagon, took me to see Dad.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.517
- You're lucky I was
there to save you.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.754
- And the worst part
was I tried it again,

23:43.756 --> 23:45.022
a couple of weeks later.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.726
(Emma laughs)

23:49.896 --> 23:50.961
Just me and you, Em.

23:58.871 --> 23:59.737
- What happened?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.673
(tense music)

24:02.675 --> 24:05.609
- Oh, it's nothing, just
some guy at the bar.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.111
- You're not fighting
again, are you?

24:09.749 --> 24:11.015
- No

24:11.017 --> 24:11.916
I promise.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.520
(dramatic music)

24:16.522 --> 24:17.822
Yeah, I lied.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.824
But I have to pay
for this somehow.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.893
And the truth is I like it.

24:24.464 --> 24:28.866
This is the one place in my
life that I have control.

24:47.787 --> 24:48.919
- Come on!

24:48.921 --> 24:51.922
(strikes thudding)

24:52.959 --> 24:54.158
(suspenseful music)

24:54.160 --> 24:55.793
- Come on, Josh.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.896
(Emma whispering)

25:10.142 --> 25:12.009
(big fighter grunts)
(Josh thuds)

25:12.011 --> 25:14.845
(solemn music)

25:21.921 --> 25:26.991
(strikes thudding)
(big fighter grunting)

25:28.861 --> 25:30.027
You're   a liar.

25:30.029 --> 25:30.861
You lied to me.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.196
You're a liar, Josh.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.631
You're a liar.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.835
(dramatic music)

25:44.977 --> 25:47.778
What are you doing, Josh?

25:47.780 --> 25:50.281
You know, I thought
I could trust you,

25:53.119 --> 25:54.718
just you and me,

25:57.290 --> 25:58.889
but look at you.

26:00.293 --> 26:01.892
You're nothing but a liar.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.863
I don't even know you anymore.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.699
(dramatic music)

26:15.942 --> 26:18.876
(Josh grunting)

26:19.612 --> 26:22.613
(punches thudding)

26:39.332 --> 26:42.166
(hands clapping)

26:53.012 --> 26:55.879
(gentle music)

27:08.761 --> 27:11.662
(motorcycle revs)

27:40.693 --> 27:42.292
- You want something?

27:43.663 --> 27:46.030
(tense music)

27:49.902 --> 27:51.902
- [Mason] Where is she?

27:52.838 --> 27:54.104
- What'd you say?

27:58.811 --> 28:02.946
- [Mason] I'd like to
meet your sister, Joshua.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.449
- [Josh] What was that?

28:05.451 --> 28:08.952
- [Mason] She is
very, very dear to me.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.922
- Mention her again!

28:11.924 --> 28:12.990
Mention her!

28:13.793 --> 28:15.426
You have no idea who I am.

28:16.962 --> 28:20.998
- [Mason] You don't know
who I am, who I am, either.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.901
(Josh grunts)

28:23.903 --> 28:26.370
(somber music)

28:49.028 --> 28:51.795
(door creaks)

29:26.932 --> 29:28.198
- We failed her.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.944
- [Emma] You were
here to protect me.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.480
(ominous music)

29:46.886 --> 29:49.419
(Josh groaning)

30:04.870 --> 30:07.371
- [Doug] Jeez, Josh, what
the hell happened to you?

30:10.042 --> 30:12.810
- (sighs) Someone found us.

30:12.812 --> 30:13.510
- [Doug] Who?

30:14.980 --> 30:15.879
- I don't know.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.216
But he's looking for her.

30:23.589 --> 30:26.190
I always thought I
could keep her safe

30:26.192 --> 30:27.090
But now

30:29.328 --> 30:30.360
I'm not so sure.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.566
- What do you want to do?

30:38.537 --> 30:41.038
- I think we need
to call your friend.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.373
- Okay, I'll give him a call.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.875
- If we do this,

30:44.877 --> 30:46.910
(suspenseful music)

30:46.912 --> 30:48.212
we need to do it my way.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.319
(Josh sighs)

31:00.226 --> 31:01.124
- Josh.

31:04.463 --> 31:05.362
What am I?

31:10.870 --> 31:12.236
- You're my sister.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.503
That's all that matters.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.575
- If that's true,
then why am I here?

31:22.147 --> 31:23.914
When you found me
in the bathroom,

31:27.887 --> 31:32.189
I wasn't trying to kill
myself, not really.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.060
I just needed to know
if I was alive or not,

31:39.098 --> 31:41.932
if I was human,
if I would bleed,

31:44.169 --> 31:46.904
or just wake up from a dream.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.908
I don't remember what happens,

31:53.612 --> 31:55.913
but I remember the
faces after it happened,

31:58.984 --> 32:00.918
every single one.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.591
(Josh sighs)

32:09.395 --> 32:12.629
- I'm gonna get you out
of here, Emma, I promise.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.699
I'm gonna get you
home, very soon.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.703
- No more promises, Josh.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.945
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

32:27.947 --> 32:31.014
(footsteps clatter)

32:34.386 --> 32:35.419
(Josh sighs)

32:35.421 --> 32:37.287
- Why'd you want to meet here?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.123
- Ah, bodies are heavy to carry.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.328
It's easier to dump them if
they're already at the bridge.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.402
Well, let's go meet the doctor.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.206
You'll need that.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.551
- Josh, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Dunn.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.753
- Joshua, it is a
pleasure to meet you.

33:13.258 --> 33:14.308
- So tell me, Doctor,

33:14.309 --> 33:15.359
how is it you think
you can help my sister?

33:15.361 --> 33:19.129
- Okay, uh, we'll
get right to it then.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.331
Doug here has shared your
sister's case with me.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.500
I think I may be able to help.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.469
- (chuckles) Well, that's
a bit of a problem.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.771
See, she's not the
biggest fan of doctors.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.640
In our experience, they
tend to make things worse.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.643
- Josh, my interest is
in the marginalized,

33:34.747 --> 33:36.313
those who don't fit
into regular society.

33:36.315 --> 33:40.250
Think square pegs, round holes.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.319
We all have our differences,

33:42.321 --> 33:45.022
but some of us have
something more.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.591
Those are the people
who interest me.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.311
They're not just different.

33:50.312 --> 33:53.030
They can, they can do things
that aren't naturally possible.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.699
(tense music)

33:55.701 --> 33:59.036
I guess what I'm trying to
say is some people are capable

33:59.038 --> 34:01.138
of some crazy shit.

34:07.513 --> 34:10.147
From what I've
heard, your sister,

34:11.150 --> 34:13.050
she might be one
of these people.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.052
- And what if she is?

34:19.458 --> 34:20.791
- Then she's probably afraid,

34:22.161 --> 34:23.527
afraid of what she can do.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.797
But I help my patients
understand their abilities,

34:26.799 --> 34:30.734
and in some cases, maybe
even your sister's case,

34:32.271 --> 34:33.837
I can help them to control it.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.110
- All right.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.452
But this is how it's gonna be.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.754
- What does that mean?

34:50.756 --> 34:53.690
(dramatic music)

34:53.692 --> 34:55.125
- You'll have one week.

34:56.462 --> 34:57.727
You'll stay in the building,

34:57.729 --> 34:59.329
and you won't have
access to a phone.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.400
You try to get inside
her head, you're gone.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.769
You try a test
without running it

35:05.771 --> 35:08.171
by me first, you're gone.

35:08.173 --> 35:11.208
(solemn music)

35:11.210 --> 35:14.177
And if you touch
her, you're gone.

35:28.293 --> 35:33.363
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

35:40.539 --> 35:42.372
(door clacks)

35:42.374 --> 35:43.273
- Hi.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.577
(clock ticking)

35:50.782 --> 35:53.200
- You here to fix me?

35:53.201 --> 35:55.619
- (sighs) No, I'm, I'm
here to understand you.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.256
- You might not like
what you find, Doctor.

36:00.792 --> 36:04.594
- (chuckles) You don't
need to call me that.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.931
- Isn't that what
you are, a doctor?

36:11.270 --> 36:12.769
- [Malcolm] I'm a specialist.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.306
- What does that mean?

36:16.308 --> 36:18.408
- It means I know
enough to be dangerous.

36:19.878 --> 36:20.710
It's a bad joke.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.779
I'm a bit nervous here.

36:26.785 --> 36:27.651
I'm Malcolm.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.489
We should talk.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.693
(birds twittering)

36:38.897 --> 36:40.197
- Out for a walk?

36:43.702 --> 36:44.801
Care to join me?

36:58.317 --> 36:59.816
I saw a picture in your trailer,

36:59.818 --> 37:01.785
um, old girlfriend?

37:01.787 --> 37:04.988
- (laughs) No,
that is my sister.

37:04.990 --> 37:05.889
- Ah.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.693
(laughs) Do you
still keep in touch?

37:10.662 --> 37:11.561
- A little.

37:12.864 --> 37:13.863
She's not well.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.270
- I'm really sorry.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.004
Is she--

37:21.006 --> 37:22.505
- She's in Trafalgar now.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.878
Look, I appreciate
what you're doing.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.414
It's just, right now, I can't--

37:31.416 --> 37:32.315
- Can't...

37:34.353 --> 37:35.986
I'm just having a
drink with a friend.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.999
(crickets chirping)

37:51.837 --> 37:54.571
(floor squeaks)

37:55.707 --> 38:00.810
(door squeaks)
(door clacks)

38:00.812 --> 38:01.711
Josh.

38:03.048 --> 38:03.947
Hmm.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.936
(floor squeaking)
(suspenseful music)

38:26.938 --> 38:30.073
(footsteps rustling)

39:33.638 --> 39:35.405
- Charming and dark.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.876
(clock ticking)

39:39.878 --> 39:42.512
Emma, I need you to know
that you can trust me.

39:46.451 --> 39:50.920
Years ago, a boy, he
arrived at my office.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.123
He had a, he had a gift too.

39:55.627 --> 39:56.559
He could take the momentum

39:56.561 --> 39:58.895
from things around him, hold it,

40:01.867 --> 40:02.966
redirect it.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.569
At first, it was
arbitrary, destructive.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.908
But then, he, uh, he
learned to control it.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.478
Oh, it was incredible to see.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.548
(suspenseful music)

40:26.792 --> 40:29.993
Emma, that boy, he was broken,

40:31.863 --> 40:33.062
but I was able to help him.

40:34.466 --> 40:37.100
And I believe that I
can do the same for you,

40:37.102 --> 40:37.967
if you'll let me.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.706
- Mine isn't a gift.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.944
You haven't seen
what I could do.

40:49.848 --> 40:50.914
- But I'd like to.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.954
Will you show me, please?

41:01.526 --> 41:02.959
- It doesn't work like that.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.029
- No?

41:23.548 --> 41:24.214
But if it did,

41:26.551 --> 41:28.685
wouldn't that mean there's
nothing wrong with you?

41:29.721 --> 41:31.338
And if there's nothing
wrong with you,

41:31.339 --> 41:32.956
wouldn't that mean you
can leave this place?

41:49.174 --> 41:50.940
(door clangs)

41:50.942 --> 41:54.277
(dramatic music)

41:54.279 --> 41:56.980
(ball clatters)

41:58.984 --> 42:01.885
(clock ticking)

42:03.088 --> 42:04.854
- So what happened to the boy?

42:11.162 --> 42:13.563
- Do you listen to all
of our conversations?

42:15.767 --> 42:17.800
- What happened to the boy?

42:20.605 --> 42:21.304
- I don't know.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.874
He wanted to find
others like him,

42:25.877 --> 42:27.644
give them a place to feel safe.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.913
- A place to be safe?

42:29.915 --> 42:31.047
- You would know about that.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.817
I often wonder if he succeeded.

42:34.819 --> 42:37.587
(tense music)

42:39.791 --> 42:42.825
Say, uh, coffee?

42:42.827 --> 42:46.229
Or just refried beans
and canned fish?

42:48.667 --> 42:50.800
- Yeah, there's a
machine over there.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.770
- Ah, can I?

42:53.772 --> 42:54.837
- Yeah.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.045
- Instant.

43:03.915 --> 43:04.847
That's great.

43:05.884 --> 43:09.586
That's great.
(jar clacks)

43:09.588 --> 43:10.787
- So can you help her?

43:10.789 --> 43:14.891
- Josh, whatever you may
believe about your sister,

43:18.029 --> 43:19.379
she's not sick.

43:19.380 --> 43:20.730
There's a scientific
solution for all of it.

43:21.967 --> 43:23.866
- So what are you saying?

43:23.868 --> 43:26.069
- I'm not interested
in fixing her.

43:26.071 --> 43:27.637
She's special.

43:27.639 --> 43:30.273
She can do extraordinary things.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.812
- So if you're not
interested in fixing her,

43:35.814 --> 43:37.246
what are you interested in?

43:38.183 --> 43:40.950
- Something triggers all of it.

43:41.853 --> 43:42.752
I'm not sure how.

43:42.754 --> 43:43.786
I'm not sure why.

43:43.788 --> 43:47.023
But I figure it all has
to do with the amygdala.

43:47.025 --> 43:48.257
It's the part of the brain

43:48.259 --> 43:49.959
that's responsible
for decision-making.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.629
For the rest of us,
when we face that,

43:52.631 --> 43:54.931
that fight-or-flight situation,

43:56.067 --> 43:58.635
the decision we make,
it, it isn't logical.

43:58.637 --> 44:00.670
It's no different for her.

44:00.672 --> 44:03.206
- I would say it's a
lot different with her.

44:03.208 --> 44:07.143
- Sure, but what she's
capable of isn't the issue.

44:08.713 --> 44:11.080
I mean, if we -- or she --
can just, can just learn

44:11.082 --> 44:13.916
to control that, that
split-second decision...

44:15.220 --> 44:17.020
- So you believe it's possible?

44:21.226 --> 44:22.125
- Yeah, I do.

44:26.331 --> 44:31.401
(suspenseful music)
(footsteps rustling)

44:40.845 --> 44:42.845
(flashlight buzzing)

44:42.847 --> 44:44.981
- [Man] Mighty early
for trespassing.

44:49.688 --> 44:50.420
- I'm sorry.

44:50.422 --> 44:51.821
I was just looking for someone.

44:52.824 --> 44:54.323
- [Man] Are you alone?

44:54.325 --> 44:56.426
I wouldn't recommend
a pretty girl

44:56.428 --> 44:58.161
like you being out here alone.

44:59.831 --> 45:01.998
Nobody could hear you
if you got into trouble.

45:03.968 --> 45:05.234
Who are you looking for?

45:06.271 --> 45:08.805
- Um, just a friend.

45:08.807 --> 45:10.206
He lives back there.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.374
- You mean Joshua?

45:12.811 --> 45:14.177
- Yeah.

45:14.179 --> 45:16.979
- (laughs) Why
didn't you say that?

45:16.981 --> 45:19.015
I haven't seen him for a while.

45:19.017 --> 45:20.883
I only see him when
the rent's due.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.720
- Rent?

45:23.722 --> 45:25.188
- [Landlord] Yeah,
for the property.

45:26.024 --> 45:27.256
- [Amanda] He rents this?

45:27.258 --> 45:29.892
- (laughs) Yeah,
until he buys it,

45:29.894 --> 45:30.893
whenever that is.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.331
He came out here with
his sister (chuckles).

45:37.902 --> 45:40.169
I'm always afraid I'm gonna
find her dead body buried

45:40.171 --> 45:41.504
in the ground somewhere.

45:42.974 --> 45:43.873
Too bad.

45:44.976 --> 45:46.409
She wasn't hard on the eyes.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.112
- She's at Trafalgar.

45:54.419 --> 45:55.585
- Trafalgar.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.752
Crazy runs in the family, too.

45:57.889 --> 46:00.857
The house used to be in
the family, you know.

46:00.859 --> 46:02.058
His grandfather built it.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.928
(laughs) The old geezer
was always ravin'

46:05.930 --> 46:10.032
about government testing
and end-of-the-world stuff.

46:11.102 --> 46:15.404
Rumor is he, uh, he
built a Cold War bunker

46:16.508 --> 46:18.508
and stocked it for the
apocalypse (laughs).

46:20.545 --> 46:23.279
Strange stuff always
happened around them,

46:24.182 --> 46:25.448
after the accident.

46:28.853 --> 46:33.189
Anyway, I, uh, I got
things to deal with.

46:33.191 --> 46:36.492
(ominous music)

46:36.494 --> 46:38.027
Take care of yourself.

46:39.063 --> 46:42.198
(footsteps rustling)

46:48.273 --> 46:50.439
(wood cracking)

46:50.441 --> 46:53.509
(suspenseful music)

47:11.429 --> 47:12.929
- Amanda?

47:12.931 --> 47:13.963
What are you doing out here?

47:13.965 --> 47:16.899
- Uh, yeah, I, um--

47:16.901 --> 47:17.900
- Are you okay?

47:18.837 --> 47:21.003
- Can we get outta here?

47:21.005 --> 47:22.572
- Let's go back inside.

47:24.075 --> 47:26.375
(solemn music)

47:30.515 --> 47:33.082
(eerie music)

47:36.254 --> 47:38.321
(clock ticking)

47:38.323 --> 47:41.023
- The first step is to figure
out what triggers them.

47:42.193 --> 47:43.326
Tell me what happens.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.362
- I don't remember.

47:50.001 --> 47:52.635
I get angry, overwhelmed,

47:52.637 --> 47:56.205
and then I just black out.

47:57.242 --> 48:00.576
- You don't remember
anything else?

48:00.578 --> 48:03.346
(Emma sighs)

48:03.348 --> 48:05.014
Is it always anger?

48:06.517 --> 48:07.416
- I think so.

48:09.921 --> 48:10.620
No.

48:13.358 --> 48:14.523
Sometimes, I'm afraid.

48:17.395 --> 48:18.461
- Will you trust me?

48:20.932 --> 48:22.031
- Yes.

48:25.036 --> 48:27.904
- Do you remember those pyramid
food chains from school?

48:29.908 --> 48:32.074
Millions of blades of
grass from one cow,

48:33.011 --> 48:34.677
hundreds of cows for one human.

48:36.648 --> 48:38.547
We're all blades of
grass to someone.

48:41.352 --> 48:46.422
Alexander the Great, Genghis
Khan, Ramesses the Second,

48:47.926 --> 48:49.943
men who accomplished
great feats only possible

48:49.944 --> 48:51.961
on the backs of the nameless
thousands who served them.

48:53.164 --> 48:56.032
For most of us, our sole
purpose is to serve others,

48:56.935 --> 48:58.034
like the ant.

48:59.404 --> 49:01.437
He works, he
builds, he provides,

49:01.439 --> 49:04.140
not for himself,
but for his queen.

49:06.711 --> 49:08.277
The masses of this
world are designed

49:08.279 --> 49:09.979
to feed the singularities.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.683
- The, the singularities?

49:13.685 --> 49:18.087
- You, Emma, you are here
because you're great,

49:19.190 --> 49:21.457
beyond what most of
us could ever dream.

49:21.459 --> 49:24.093
You are the singularity.

49:25.296 --> 49:26.662
I'm not here by chance.

49:28.733 --> 49:32.068
Over a year ago, I was
called into a hospital.

49:33.271 --> 49:35.471
There had been an incident.

49:40.979 --> 49:43.479
Over 150 people tried
to kill themselves,

49:44.682 --> 49:49.518
at exactly the same time,
in exactly the same way.

49:49.520 --> 49:53.489
My task was to interview
these patients, find out why.

49:55.593 --> 49:56.759
But none of them knew.

49:59.063 --> 50:00.329
None of them could remember.

50:01.632 --> 50:03.733
So I went back and I looked
at those records again,

50:05.670 --> 50:08.738
and I found out one
other interesting
thing from that night.

50:11.409 --> 50:13.275
There was one patient
who went missing,

50:13.277 --> 50:16.445
(suspenseful music)

50:16.447 --> 50:20.049
a girl who was checked
in by her brother

50:20.051 --> 50:21.150
for a drug overdose.

50:22.754 --> 50:23.753
She was suicidal.

50:27.025 --> 50:28.257
And I believe that she tried

50:28.259 --> 50:30.459
to kill herself
again, that night.

50:32.597 --> 50:37.066
Now I also believe
that that girl was you.

50:39.637 --> 50:44.673
Emma (sighs), I
want you to be free.

50:45.710 --> 50:48.811
You are capable of
some incredible things.

50:53.818 --> 50:55.418
- I want to talk to my brother.

50:58.756 --> 51:01.457
- You want to talk
to your brother?

51:05.663 --> 51:06.479
Why?

51:06.480 --> 51:07.296
He doesn't want to talk to you.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.299
- You don't know my brother.

51:10.301 --> 51:11.767
- Do you?

51:11.769 --> 51:14.070
Do you know that he's
been seeing someone?

51:15.440 --> 51:17.473
Oh, you didn't know, did you?

51:19.310 --> 51:20.776
You're in here, rotting,

51:21.846 --> 51:24.580
and he's out there,
moving on with his life.

51:24.582 --> 51:25.548
Seems fair.

51:28.186 --> 51:29.085
- You're lying.

51:29.754 --> 51:32.588
(solemn music)

51:38.763 --> 51:41.497
(ominous music)

51:48.873 --> 51:52.108
- Do you know why
you're here, Emma?

51:56.848 --> 51:59.815
It's because your brother
has given up on you.

51:59.817 --> 52:03.252
He's ashamed of you,
and he's rejected you

52:03.254 --> 52:05.121
by putting you into this hole.

52:06.290 --> 52:09.158
Why do you feel so tied to
him when he finds it so easy

52:09.160 --> 52:10.826
to walk away from you?

52:12.897 --> 52:14.363
- You may need to leave.

52:15.233 --> 52:16.532
- Stop holding out on me!

52:16.534 --> 52:17.766
(Emma grunts)
(hand slaps)

52:17.768 --> 52:21.203
(Emma gasping)
Yeah, yeah.

52:21.205 --> 52:22.771
Show yourself to me.

52:22.773 --> 52:26.909
Stop hiding what makes you
different from everyone else.

52:26.911 --> 52:29.178
- (sobs) Please leave.

52:29.180 --> 52:30.846
(hand slaps)
(Malcolm grunts)

52:30.848 --> 52:33.215
- Come on, there you are.

52:35.686 --> 52:37.853
I know it's in there.

52:37.855 --> 52:40.356
Show yourself to me.

52:40.358 --> 52:41.257
(tense music)

52:41.259 --> 52:43.926
(Emma sobbing)

52:47.398 --> 52:48.297
You know,

52:49.634 --> 52:51.734
if you're just gonna let
them control you like this,

52:51.736 --> 52:54.170
then I guess you're the
freak that they say you are,

52:54.172 --> 52:56.672
and this place, this
is where you belong.

52:59.610 --> 53:00.743
(Malcolm sighs)

53:00.745 --> 53:01.810
(Emma sobbing)

53:01.812 --> 53:04.647
(solemn music)

53:12.456 --> 53:13.355
I'm sorry.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.259
Hey.

53:17.261 --> 53:18.761
I mean, it's just
like you said, right,

53:18.763 --> 53:20.396
that, right now, you're afraid.

53:20.398 --> 53:23.265
You're angry, and
nothing happened.

53:23.935 --> 53:25.534
Nothing triggered you.

53:28.773 --> 53:32.341
You know, everything
I'm doing is for you.

53:35.513 --> 53:39.982
Please, Emma, I need you to
forgive me, please, please.

53:45.523 --> 53:48.257
(Malcolm sighs)

53:49.827 --> 53:52.695
(Emma sobbing)

54:04.375 --> 54:06.775
(door rattles)

54:06.777 --> 54:11.714
(door thuds)
(ax thuds)

54:15.286 --> 54:16.819
- [Emma] Josh, Josh,

54:18.356 --> 54:20.789
(ominous music)
Josh, I don't want to be here.

54:20.791 --> 54:23.892
I don't want to be here,
I don't want to be here.

54:23.894 --> 54:25.294
Help me, Joshua.

54:27.265 --> 54:27.963
Help me.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.000
Help me, Josh.

54:32.637 --> 54:35.437
(dramatic music)

55:07.705 --> 55:10.773
(Emma yells)

55:10.775 --> 55:14.310
(electricity crackling)

55:14.312 --> 55:15.311
(people groaning)

55:15.313 --> 55:18.380
(people chattering)

55:20.017 --> 55:21.784
- [Man] Oh my God.

55:25.556 --> 55:26.455
(Emma sobbing)

55:27.358 --> 55:29.625
- I know what's in there.

55:29.627 --> 55:31.827
- [Man] Give yourself to me.

55:33.531 --> 55:35.964
(Josh panting)

55:42.840 --> 55:45.874
(Josh grunts)

55:45.876 --> 55:48.677
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

55:48.679 --> 55:51.547
(door thuds)

55:51.549 --> 55:54.950
(electricity crackling)

55:58.389 --> 55:59.088
Emma.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.057
Emma.

56:02.059 --> 56:03.859
(Emma gasping)

56:03.861 --> 56:05.661
- He said he's sorry.

56:09.834 --> 56:12.401
(tense music)

56:14.472 --> 56:17.106
(dramatic music)

56:19.477 --> 56:20.876
Please don't do anything.

56:28.819 --> 56:30.052
(door thuds)

56:30.054 --> 56:32.488
(strikes thudding)
(Josh grunting)

56:32.490 --> 56:33.889
(Malcolm groans)
- Stop!

56:33.891 --> 56:35.491
No, no!

56:35.493 --> 56:37.559
Please don't, I'm sorry!

56:38.662 --> 56:43.632
(Josh grunting)
(Emma whispering)

56:44.101 --> 56:47.636
(electricity crackling)

56:47.638 --> 56:50.472
(dramatic music)

57:01.952 --> 57:07.022
- Get out!
(Malcolm groans)

57:08.159 --> 57:11.894
- [Malcolm] No, no, no,
it's not what you think.

57:11.896 --> 57:12.861
I need to see it
to understand it.

57:12.863 --> 57:14.596
I need to know.
- No.

57:14.598 --> 57:15.864
- [Malcolm] I need to
know what her trigger is.

57:15.866 --> 57:17.699
- No, you needed to help
her, not make her worse!

57:17.701 --> 57:18.901
- [Malcolm] No, you
can't hide her, Josh.

57:18.903 --> 57:20.969
I'm the only one trying to, ah!

57:20.971 --> 57:22.905
(Malcolm gasping)

57:22.907 --> 57:24.006
No, no!

57:25.910 --> 57:27.810
- Look at me!

57:27.812 --> 57:30.145
If you talk to
anyone about this,

57:30.147 --> 57:32.681
if you try to come
back, and God help me,

57:32.683 --> 57:35.050
if I ever see you again,

57:35.052 --> 57:36.452
(Malcolm gasps)

57:36.454 --> 57:37.686
I will kill you.

57:39.657 --> 57:43.792
(Malcolm sighs)
(Malcolm laughs)

57:43.794 --> 57:46.662
(Malcolm panting)

57:52.870 --> 57:55.237
(engine revs)

57:56.774 --> 57:58.607
I know I messed up.

58:00.578 --> 58:01.844
But I have a plan to fix it.

58:03.581 --> 58:04.947
I'm gonna take one last fight,

58:04.949 --> 58:06.248
and with the money from that,

58:07.551 --> 58:09.485
I'm gonna get Emma
far away from here.

58:10.788 --> 58:13.655
It's never been safe unless
it's just the two of us.

58:43.654 --> 58:44.586
- Hi, can I help you?

58:44.588 --> 58:45.954
- Looking for an Emma Coleman.

58:48.259 --> 58:49.525
- Sorry, Emma who?

58:49.527 --> 58:53.161
- Emma Coleman, um, I'm bringing
something from her brother.

58:54.098 --> 58:55.931
- There's no Emma Coleman.

58:55.933 --> 58:57.065
She's not here.

58:58.102 --> 58:59.701
No, I know every patient
in this facility.

58:59.703 --> 59:00.936
There's no one by that name.

59:00.938 --> 59:02.538
You must be in the wrong place.

59:04.575 --> 59:05.841
- Okay, thank you.

59:07.144 --> 59:08.043
- Yup.

59:19.557 --> 59:21.156
(pager buzzing)

59:21.158 --> 59:23.058
(dramatic music)

59:23.060 --> 59:25.294
(suited fighter grunts)

59:25.296 --> 59:28.063
(solemn music)

59:28.065 --> 59:30.933
(Josh gasping)

59:35.940 --> 59:41.009
(strikes thudding)
(both grunting)

59:57.061 --> 1:00:00.062
(dramatic music)

1:00:04.969 --> 1:00:07.636
(Josh panting)

1:00:11.842 --> 1:00:16.912
(both grunting)
(strikes thudding)

1:00:20.851 --> 1:00:23.652

(suited fighter growls)

1:00:32.896 --> 1:00:37.966
(both grunting)
(strikes thudding)

1:00:41.839 --> 1:00:47.075
(dramatic music)
(energy warbling)

1:00:49.780 --> 1:00:54.816
(both grunting)
(strikes thudding)

1:01:03.293 --> 1:01:05.861
(suited fighter gasps)

1:01:05.863 --> 1:01:10.932

(Emma whispering)

1:01:16.306 --> 1:01:18.173
(Emma gasps)
(ball clatters)

1:01:18.175 --> 1:01:20.909
(ominous music)

1:01:27.951 --> 1:01:31.019
(crickets chirping)

1:01:33.023 --> 1:01:36.091
(suspenseful music)

1:02:05.389 --> 1:02:08.223
(metal clanging)

1:02:36.019 --> 1:02:39.054
(Amanda panting)

1:03:12.189 --> 1:03:14.990
(static hissing)

1:03:23.967 --> 1:03:27.169
(door creaking)

1:03:27.171 --> 1:03:29.371
(door thuds)

1:03:29.373 --> 1:03:32.207
(Amanda gasping)

1:03:52.930 --> 1:03:57.999
(door buzzes)
(lock clangs)

1:03:58.569 --> 1:04:01.303
(clock ticking)

1:04:04.942 --> 1:04:07.442
(door thuds)

1:04:12.883 --> 1:04:14.950
- It's all right.

1:04:14.952 --> 1:04:17.385
My name's--
- I know who you are.

1:04:18.922 --> 1:04:19.888
- [Amanda] Really?

1:04:21.024 --> 1:04:23.225
Your brother told you about me?

1:04:23.227 --> 1:04:24.125
- No.

1:04:25.929 --> 1:04:26.928
No, he didn't.

1:04:26.930 --> 1:04:29.865
(ominous music)

1:04:31.101 --> 1:04:34.436
- [Mason] How does it work
between the two of you?

1:04:34.438 --> 1:04:38.940
You sister, sister,
the connection?

1:04:39.910 --> 1:04:41.276
I have a theory.

1:04:41.278 --> 1:04:43.612
Are you angry?

1:04:43.614 --> 1:04:44.880
Are you afraid?

1:04:45.616 --> 1:04:48.350
(Josh grunting)

1:04:52.489 --> 1:04:54.322
You should be.

1:04:54.324 --> 1:04:59.294
(Josh grunts)
(Emma gasps)

1:05:00.330 --> 1:05:05.400
- Are you--
(Emma gasping)

1:05:07.237 --> 1:05:10.038
- [Mason] Does she
feel everything

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:11.907
or just the pain?

1:05:11.909 --> 1:05:14.242
(Josh panting)

1:05:14.244 --> 1:05:16.011
How does it work?

1:05:16.013 --> 1:05:17.679
- You shouldn't be here.

1:05:17.681 --> 1:05:19.514
- [Emma] Who are you?

1:05:20.617 --> 1:05:22.284
- I'm gonna go get
some help, okay?

1:05:23.387 --> 1:05:26.554
- [Emma] What do
you want with her?

1:05:26.556 --> 1:05:29.357
(Amanda gasping)

1:05:31.228 --> 1:05:32.594
(solemn music)

(electricity crackling)
(Amanda gasping)

1:05:35.465 --> 1:05:36.965
I'll kill you.

1:05:40.304 --> 1:05:44.005
(fist banging)
(muffled speaking)

1:05:44.007 --> 1:05:47.375
(electricity crackling)

1:05:47.377 --> 1:05:49.978
- [Mason] When did
it start, it start?

1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:53.381
Was it always this
way, always this way?

1:05:55.719 --> 1:05:59.054
- [Mason] Does she feel
other people's pain?

1:05:59.056 --> 1:06:02.090
(dramatic music)

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:05.060
You can't keep me here, Josh.

1:06:05.062 --> 1:06:07.195
- [Mason] How does it work?

1:06:10.100 --> 1:06:12.367
(strikes thudding)
(Josh grunting)

1:06:12.369 --> 1:06:15.003
(solemn music)

1:06:25.983 --> 1:06:28.516
(pager buzzing)

1:06:29.987 --> 1:06:31.152
(Josh yells)

1:06:31.154 --> 1:06:32.587
- [Mason] Enough!

1:06:32.589 --> 1:06:35.256
(Josh gagging)

1:06:37.494 --> 1:06:38.727
(Josh gasps)

1:06:38.729 --> 1:06:40.495
(lock clangs)

1:06:40.497 --> 1:06:41.596
- Leave.
(electricity crackling)

1:06:41.598 --> 1:06:43.064
- Emma!
(syringe zips)

1:06:43.066 --> 1:06:44.132
- No.

1:06:44.134 --> 1:06:45.033
- Em.

1:06:45.035 --> 1:06:49.738
Emma, I can't breathe.
(Emma grunts)

1:06:49.740 --> 1:06:50.638
Let go.

1:06:53.043 --> 1:06:55.143
(Emma wheezing)

1:06:55.145 --> 1:06:57.078
Em, I can't breathe.

1:06:58.015 --> 1:07:00.682
(solemn music)

1:07:21.038 --> 1:07:22.504
(doorknob rattles)

1:07:22.506 --> 1:07:24.305

1:07:25.542 --> 1:07:28.109
(Josh groans)

1:07:33.450 --> 1:07:34.349
- No.

1:07:35.452 --> 1:07:37.652
(Emma yells)

1:07:37.654 --> 1:07:40.555
(explosion roars)

1:07:45.695 --> 1:07:50.765
(electricity crackling)
(ominous music)

1:07:59.509 --> 1:08:01.109
Give it back!
- Come and get it.

1:08:01.111 --> 1:08:02.510
- Josh!
- No way.

1:08:02.512 --> 1:08:03.845
- Give it back!

1:08:06.850 --> 1:08:09.617
- Come and get it.
- Give it back!

1:08:09.619 --> 1:08:11.820
- Joshua, give her
back the bunny now!

1:08:14.357 --> 1:08:15.590
Joshua!

1:08:15.592 --> 1:08:16.257
- Josh!
- Give her back the bunny!

1:08:16.259 --> 1:08:17.459
- Give it back!

1:08:17.461 --> 1:08:19.327
- [Dad] Joshua, give
her back the bunny, now!

1:08:19.329 --> 1:08:20.628
- Give it back!
(horn honks)

1:08:20.630 --> 1:08:25.166
(air bag pops)
(tires squealing)

1:08:25.168 --> 1:08:25.867
- Josh.

1:08:27.404 --> 1:08:29.170
(Dad groans)

1:08:29.172 --> 1:08:30.338
Josh.

1:08:30.340 --> 1:08:32.807
(somber music)

1:08:34.778 --> 1:08:37.812
(Dad grunting)

1:08:37.814 --> 1:08:39.414
Are you okay, buddy?

1:08:39.416 --> 1:08:41.416
Hey, hey, look at
me, look at me.

1:08:42.552 --> 1:08:44.352
This may not make
sense, right now,

1:08:46.356 --> 1:08:48.590
but you and your
sister are connected.

1:08:51.695 --> 1:08:53.862
No matter what happens next,

1:08:53.864 --> 1:08:55.864
I need you to protect her.

1:08:55.866 --> 1:08:58.733
(Josh sobs)

1:08:58.735 --> 1:09:01.803
(crickets chirping)

1:09:11.615 --> 1:09:14.616
(phone rings)

1:09:14.618 --> 1:09:16.651
- [Operator] 911, what
is your emergency?

1:09:16.653 --> 1:09:18.419
- Hi, uh, I need help.

1:09:18.421 --> 1:09:19.921
- [Operator] Can you
explain your situation?

1:09:19.923 --> 1:09:21.589
- Uh, uh, there's a woman here.

1:09:21.591 --> 1:09:22.824
I don't know who, she's from
that mental institution,

1:09:22.826 --> 1:09:24.425
but she's attacked
several people.

1:09:24.427 --> 1:09:25.927
I think she may have
even killed someone.

1:09:25.929 --> 1:09:27.762
I heard screaming, and--
- Sir, what is your location?

1:09:27.764 --> 1:09:31.332
- Uh, uh, 11 Foxline.
- Sir, are you in danger?

1:09:31.334 --> 1:09:32.834
- Emma.

1:09:32.836 --> 1:09:33.735
Emma!

1:09:37.741 --> 1:09:39.507
Doug.

1:09:39.509 --> 1:09:40.408
Doug!

1:09:42.779 --> 1:09:45.547
(Doug coughing)

1:09:45.549 --> 1:09:46.848
Wait, Amanda!

1:09:46.850 --> 1:09:48.783
- Don't touch me!

1:09:49.653 --> 1:09:50.885
I'm calling the police.

1:09:50.887 --> 1:09:52.654
- No, no, no, you
cannot do that!

1:09:53.823 --> 1:09:55.356
They will kill her.

1:09:57.527 --> 1:09:58.760
- Who are you?

1:10:01.331 --> 1:10:02.797
Who are you, Josh?

1:10:02.799 --> 1:10:05.934
You're not normal, and
your sister is not normal!

1:10:05.936 --> 1:10:06.834
- All right.

1:10:09.606 --> 1:10:11.206
Ever since I was little,
I can take a hit.

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:12.540
- And her?

1:10:12.542 --> 1:10:14.342
She almost killed him.

1:10:15.845 --> 1:10:17.845
- She's not a bad person.

1:10:17.847 --> 1:10:19.347
She just needs help.

1:10:19.983 --> 1:10:20.882
That's why she's here.

1:10:20.884 --> 1:10:22.750
I need to help her.

1:10:22.752 --> 1:10:24.819
She's in here for
her own safety.

1:10:24.821 --> 1:10:26.988
- Her safety?
- Yes.

1:10:26.990 --> 1:10:29.490
Until I can figure
out how to stop it,

1:10:30.594 --> 1:10:33.328
I need you to leave
the cops out of this.

1:10:33.330 --> 1:10:34.929
I need you to
forget what you saw.

1:10:37.367 --> 1:10:38.633
I need you to trust me.

1:10:40.870 --> 1:10:43.571
Just stay here until it's safe.

1:10:44.441 --> 1:10:47.842
- Josh, when you find her,

1:10:49.913 --> 1:10:51.446
don't bring her back here.

1:11:00.423 --> 1:11:01.322
You're lucky.

1:11:02.759 --> 1:11:04.025
She could've killed you.

1:11:05.262 --> 1:11:06.661
I know what it's
like to want to help.

1:11:06.663 --> 1:11:09.831
- No, I don't want
anything to do with them.

1:11:09.833 --> 1:11:10.732
- Well, at least stay until--

1:11:10.734 --> 1:11:11.833
- I'm not staying.

1:11:11.835 --> 1:11:13.635
(suspenseful music)

1:11:13.637 --> 1:11:15.970
- [Doug] Hey, wait.

1:11:15.972 --> 1:11:21.042
(radio crackling)
(radio chattering)

1:11:42.399 --> 1:11:43.064
- [Emma] Did you come

1:11:43.066 --> 1:11:45.333
did you come to save me?

1:11:46.836 --> 1:11:50.738
Or did you come
to take him away?

1:12:28.945 --> 1:12:30.511
- Josh!

1:12:30.513 --> 1:12:32.747
(dramatic music)

1:12:32.749 --> 1:12:33.648
Josh!

1:12:37.954 --> 1:12:39.887
- Amanda, behind me.

1:12:42.459 --> 1:12:43.791
- Just you and me, right?

1:12:44.928 --> 1:12:46.027
- Always.

1:12:47.630 --> 1:12:48.696
- Then who is she?

1:12:53.036 --> 1:12:55.370
- Em, don't do this here.

1:12:56.473 --> 1:12:57.805
- Why should I care
what they think?

1:12:57.807 --> 1:13:00.541
- There's no going
back if you do this.

1:13:00.543 --> 1:13:02.577
Emma, they can't
know what you can do.

1:13:03.613 --> 1:13:04.612
- What I can do?

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:07.548
Don't pretend you're
any better than me.

1:13:08.818 --> 1:13:11.853
- Emma, you need
to listen to me.

1:13:11.855 --> 1:13:13.020
- Listen to you?

1:13:13.022 --> 1:13:14.489
Trust you?

1:13:14.491 --> 1:13:17.392
I've been trusting
you my whole life!

1:13:17.394 --> 1:13:18.760
(Josh gasping)

1:13:18.762 --> 1:13:21.095
(voice whispering)
And you locked me in a cage.

1:13:21.097 --> 1:13:23.865
(Josh gasping)
(voice whispering)

1:13:23.867 --> 1:13:26.868
(dramatic music)

1:13:31.975 --> 1:13:34.842
(Josh groans)

1:13:34.844 --> 1:13:36.411
- This isn't real.

1:13:37.013 --> 1:13:38.613
This isn't real.

1:13:43.486 --> 1:13:45.953
(door thuds)

1:13:46.856 --> 1:13:49.857
- Josh, help me.

1:13:49.859 --> 1:13:52.660
(ominous music)

1:13:52.662 --> 1:13:53.928
Help me!

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:56.764
(dramatic music)

1:14:09.546 --> 1:14:10.945
- [Amanda] Josh.

1:14:11.815 --> 1:14:13.915
- Amanda, I'm in here!

1:14:15.218 --> 1:14:16.117
No, no!

1:14:18.555 --> 1:14:19.987
- Josh, what's happening?

1:14:19.989 --> 1:14:21.689
- It's just a dream.

1:14:21.691 --> 1:14:23.491
None of this is real.

1:14:23.493 --> 1:14:24.926
- How can you be sure?

1:14:24.928 --> 1:14:26.761
- None of this is real.

1:14:26.763 --> 1:14:28.146
It's Emma.

1:14:28.147 --> 1:14:29.530
She's in our head, but
you need to trust me.

1:14:29.532 --> 1:14:34.602
(flesh splats)
(tense music)

1:14:44.514 --> 1:14:46.981
(Josh gasping)

1:14:49.486 --> 1:14:50.685
(hand slapping)
Wake up!

1:14:50.687 --> 1:14:55.756
Wake up!

1:15:08.838 --> 1:15:10.972
What have you done, Emma?

1:15:12.909 --> 1:15:15.076
- You blame me for
Dad's death, don't you?

1:15:16.846 --> 1:15:18.145
That's why you locked me up.

1:15:20.216 --> 1:15:22.683
- No, you tried
to kill yourself.

1:15:22.685 --> 1:15:23.584
I had to.

1:15:25.121 --> 1:15:27.054
- But we both know
that's not true.

1:15:28.958 --> 1:15:29.857
I have a trigger.

1:15:31.227 --> 1:15:35.897
- Emma, I need you to
open this door, right now.

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:38.900
- I don't control my episodes.

1:15:40.570 --> 1:15:41.269
You do.

1:15:46.309 --> 1:15:47.942
- Emma, I am sorry.

1:15:50.013 --> 1:15:50.912
- You're right.

1:15:53.850 --> 1:15:55.716
One of us does need
to be locked up.

1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:58.920
But who says it needs to be me?

1:15:59.756 --> 1:16:02.290
(ominous music)

1:16:05.728 --> 1:16:08.195
(Josh gasping)

1:16:13.269 --> 1:16:14.869
- It's not real.

1:16:15.872 --> 1:16:16.904
It's not real.

1:16:17.941 --> 1:16:19.974
None of this is real.

1:16:21.010 --> 1:16:23.711
None of this is real.

1:16:23.713 --> 1:16:26.013
None of this is real.

1:16:26.015 --> 1:16:27.315
(dramatic music)

1:16:27.317 --> 1:16:28.749
It's not real.

1:16:29.752 --> 1:16:31.218
It's not real.

1:16:31.220 --> 1:16:34.055
(Josh gasping)

1:16:41.931 --> 1:16:45.733
- The same four walls.

1:16:45.735 --> 1:16:47.868
Nothing but empty promises.

1:16:53.009 --> 1:16:55.343
I know you tried,

1:16:55.345 --> 1:16:56.944
but I can do better.

1:16:56.946 --> 1:17:01.015
I'm gonna give you
something better than hope.

1:17:03.086 --> 1:17:04.952
Ignorance.

1:17:07.924 --> 1:17:11.959
You won't even know
you're not free.

1:17:15.898 --> 1:17:17.298
- I'm sorry, Em.

1:17:18.901 --> 1:17:22.903
I'm sorry I couldn't do it.

1:17:22.905 --> 1:17:23.804
- Do what?

1:17:24.907 --> 1:17:26.707
Forgive me?

1:17:26.709 --> 1:17:28.109
- No.

1:17:28.111 --> 1:17:30.378
Admit that I was a part of it,

1:17:32.782 --> 1:17:34.048
this whole time.

1:17:35.318 --> 1:17:38.152
I blamed you,
because I couldn't,

1:17:38.921 --> 1:17:42.156
I couldn't admit it.

1:17:42.158 --> 1:17:44.792
- Admit what?

1:17:45.895 --> 1:17:47.128
- You didn't kill Dad.

1:17:49.365 --> 1:17:50.698
I did.

1:17:50.700 --> 1:17:51.666
(dramatic music)

1:17:53.903 --> 1:17:54.869
- So that's it.

1:17:54.870 --> 1:17:55.836
You think you can just say sorry

1:17:55.838 --> 1:17:57.938
and forget it happened!

1:17:57.940 --> 1:18:00.107
It doesn't work like that!

1:18:01.844 --> 1:18:04.245
(Emma yelling)

1:18:05.882 --> 1:18:08.115
It doesn't work like that!

1:18:10.853 --> 1:18:12.453
- Show us your hands!

1:18:12.455 --> 1:18:15.022
(tense music)

1:18:16.025 --> 1:18:18.359
Show us your hands, do it now!

1:18:18.361 --> 1:18:20.928
- Ma'am, put your
hands in the air.

1:18:26.269 --> 1:18:28.936
(tense music)
(wind howling)

1:18:28.938 --> 1:18:30.037
Ma'am!

1:18:32.909 --> 1:18:35.076
- Hold it, or I will shoot!

1:18:35.078 --> 1:18:38.412
- Nothing's happened
yet, but if you do this,

1:18:38.414 --> 1:18:40.948
we will be on the run for
the rest of our lives.

1:18:40.950 --> 1:18:42.383
- You don't have to do this.

1:18:42.385 --> 1:18:44.085
I will shoot!

1:18:44.087 --> 1:18:47.822
- Emma, there's no going
back if you do this.

1:18:50.259 --> 1:18:52.860
- Ma'am, put your
hands behind your head.

1:18:52.862 --> 1:18:54.929
Do not take one more step.

1:18:54.931 --> 1:18:57.898
- Emma, you need
to listen to me.

1:18:57.900 --> 1:19:00.334
No, wait!
(gun bangs)

1:19:04.874 --> 1:19:05.773
- No.

1:19:06.409 --> 1:19:08.042
No (yells)!

1:19:08.044 --> 1:19:10.945
(energy crackles)

1:19:12.014 --> 1:19:14.882
(solemn music)

1:19:16.119 --> 1:19:19.286
(heartbeat thumping)

1:19:23.059 --> 1:19:23.958
(Josh gasping)

1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:25.459
Josh?

1:19:25.461 --> 1:19:28.362
Josh.
(Josh sighs)

1:19:49.085 --> 1:19:51.118
(gun clicks)
- No, no, no, no!

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:52.453
This is not how it ends.

1:19:52.455 --> 1:19:55.356
No, you, you were
supposed to kill her.

1:19:55.358 --> 1:19:57.291
And he would've been all angry

1:19:57.293 --> 1:19:59.827
and would never be able
to forgive you, but oh --

1:19:59.829 --> 1:20:02.530
His rage, his rage would've
made you more powerful

1:20:02.532 --> 1:20:04.999
than any of us
could ever imagine.

1:20:05.001 --> 1:20:07.402
I mean guys, I've been
more than gracious

1:20:07.403 --> 1:20:09.804
to all of you, letting you
play your parts, but now,

1:20:09.806 --> 1:20:13.874
(ominous music)
(wind whistling)

1:20:13.876 --> 1:20:15.009
(Emma whispering)

1:20:15.011 --> 1:20:17.077
but now, it's too late.

1:20:17.079 --> 1:20:20.247
(tense music)

1:20:20.249 --> 1:20:22.183
(Emma whispering)
(energy warbling)

1:20:22.185 --> 1:20:23.417
(Malcolm gasping)

1:20:23.419 --> 1:20:26.487
- [Emma] Shoot
yourself, yourself.

1:20:26.489 --> 1:20:28.956
Shoot yourself.
(Malcolm chuckles)

1:20:28.958 --> 1:20:30.157
Shoot yourself.

1:20:30.159 --> 1:20:32.459
- No, no!
- Shoot yourself.

1:20:38.201 --> 1:20:39.900
Goodbye, Malcolm.

1:20:42.505 --> 1:20:45.072
(gun bangs)

1:20:47.844 --> 1:20:49.343
- [Josh] (Inaudible)

1:20:58.955 --> 1:21:00.621
We've got to cover our tracks,

1:21:00.623 --> 1:21:02.857
not let anyone know
that you were here.

1:21:02.859 --> 1:21:04.191
(solemn music)

1:21:04.193 --> 1:21:07.294
Can't let anyone
know what's happened.

1:21:07.296 --> 1:21:09.196
Can't let anyone know.

1:21:12.535 --> 1:21:15.603
Get some (mumbles)

1:21:19.342 --> 1:21:23.244
(speech drowned out by music)

1:21:36.959 --> 1:21:39.326
- If you could go back,
would you change anything?

1:21:42.465 --> 1:21:44.164
- Em, you did what
you had to do.

1:21:46.402 --> 1:21:48.035
- No, I mean all the way back.

1:21:48.037 --> 1:21:49.637
Would you change what happened?

1:21:52.041 --> 1:21:53.974
(Josh sighs)

1:21:53.976 --> 1:21:55.175
Sometimes we're forced

1:21:55.177 --> 1:21:57.077
to make decisions
people won't understand.

1:21:58.180 --> 1:21:59.146
It doesn't make us wrong.

1:21:59.148 --> 1:22:00.981
It's just what needs to be done.

1:22:02.118 --> 1:22:04.451
It's gonna be different
this time, though.

1:22:04.453 --> 1:22:05.352
I promise.

1:22:07.690 --> 1:22:09.356
It'll be different.

1:22:14.664 --> 1:22:15.562
- You're right.

1:22:19.502 --> 1:22:21.368
It is gonna be
different, this time.

1:22:21.370 --> 1:22:24.004
(solemn music)

1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:31.979
- Emma.

1:22:33.015 --> 1:22:34.114
Emma!

1:22:34.116 --> 1:22:36.016
Emma, we need to go.

1:22:38.955 --> 1:22:41.989
(match crackles)

1:22:48.331 --> 1:22:49.496
It's better this way.

1:22:54.403 --> 1:22:57.604
(fire roars)

1:22:57.606 --> 1:23:00.374
(fire crackling)

1:23:16.692 --> 1:23:18.192
(crickets chirping)

1:23:18.194 --> 1:23:20.527
- Sir, put the gun down, sir.

1:23:22.665 --> 1:23:25.132
Sir, please put the gun down.

1:23:27.503 --> 1:23:28.569
Put it down.

1:23:30.139 --> 1:23:31.038
- I can't.

1:23:36.712 --> 1:23:39.546
(solemn music)
