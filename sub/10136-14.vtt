07:22.359 --> 07:24.194
I don't have a clue.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.486
That's for sure.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.408
I can't believe Steve

07:27.530 --> 07:29.408
and I have been going out

07:29.449 --> 07:31.076
six months tonight.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.788
Amazing, your anniversary

07:31.118 --> 07:34.788
and my 16th birthday

07:34.829 --> 07:36.206
falling on the same day.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.210
That day would be...today.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.254
What a coincidence.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.048
Coincidence?

07:42.296 --> 07:45.048
I'd call it a bombshell.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.926
Kaboom!

07:50.137 --> 07:52.973
My parents wanted to fly me to

07:50.137 --> 07:52.973
Pittsburgh for WrestleMania VI

07:53.014 --> 07:55.016
but I said no way.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.726
I knew my best friend

07:55.058 --> 07:56.726
would be planning

07:56.768 --> 07:58.645
the greatest night

07:56.768 --> 07:58.645
of my life.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.022
Does she know you, or what?

08:03.442 --> 08:05.193
Well, I can see

08:03.442 --> 08:05.193
I'm way underdressed.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.320
So I'll go

08:05.235 --> 08:06.320
home and change.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.988
Oh, don't worry,

08:06.361 --> 08:07.988
when I come back

08:08.029 --> 08:09.489
I promise I'll act surprised.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.825
Me, too.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.034
Thanks, Deej.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.623
Oh, no.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.252
I forgot the most important day

08:18.665 --> 08:22.252
of my best friend's life.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.711
This is horrible.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.547
She's never gonna set foot

08:23.753 --> 08:26.547
in this house again.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.259
And the horrible

08:26.589 --> 08:29.259
part would be..

08:32.762 --> 08:34.264
I blew it.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.640
What am I gonna do?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.190
[instrumental music]

08:44.732 --> 08:47.027
Huh, I can't believe

08:44.732 --> 08:47.027
I forgot Kimmy's birthday.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.988
I don't have a gift, a card.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.988
What am I going to do?

08:50.030 --> 08:53.283
I've got it, tell Kimmy we all

08:50.030 --> 08:53.283
went through a time warp

08:53.325 --> 08:55.452
and it's a month earlier

08:53.325 --> 08:55.452
than it really is.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.539
Great, we can flip

08:57.078 --> 08:59.539
the calendars

08:59.580 --> 09:01.916
get some old

08:59.580 --> 09:01.916
TV guides and..

09:01.958 --> 09:04.961
What am I saying?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.961
Kimmy will never believe that.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.840
Why not? She believes

09:05.003 --> 09:08.840
the Pillsbury doughboy is real.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.389
(Joey)

09:12.344 --> 09:15.389
'Common, Steph,

09:12.344 --> 09:15.389
we're ready to go.'

09:15.430 --> 09:18.599
Boy, Deej, you're really

09:15.430 --> 09:18.599
in a rough spot.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.394
Well, have a nice night.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.022
Steph, wait.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.022
Stephanie.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.149
Hey, Michelle,

09:24.064 --> 09:26.149
I've run out of lumber.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.776
We're working

09:26.191 --> 09:28.776
as fast as we can.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.322
Okay, this should be enough

09:30.195 --> 09:32.322
for you, sweetheart.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.614
- Have a good time.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.614
- Bye-bye.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.534
- Bye-bye.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.534
- See you later.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.494
Freeze.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.454
Nobody's going anywhere.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.788
Alright, I confess.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.582
I ate the last cupcake.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.918
But it wasn't my fault.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.878
The frosting,

09:44.959 --> 09:46.878
the sprinkles..

09:46.920 --> 09:48.463
He was asking for it.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.216
Guys, this is serious.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.968
I forgot that today

09:51.258 --> 09:53.968
is Kimmy's birthday.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.136
Well, the day's

09:54.010 --> 09:55.136
not over.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.179
Give her a call.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.179
Bye-bye.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.431
- See you later.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.431
- Bye-bye.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.558
Wait!

09:57.472 --> 09:59.558
This is an emergency.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.184
Kimmy's 16.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.728
She's thinks I've planned

10:01.226 --> 10:03.728
this big surprise party for her.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.439
If we don't give her one,

10:03.770 --> 10:05.439
she'll be crushed.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.648
What, we?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.648
Why we all of a sudden?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.234
Just call a couple of her

10:07.690 --> 10:09.234
friends and pay 'em enough.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.360
They'll show up.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.114
It's Saturday night.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.114
Everyone has plans.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.242
You guys have to help.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.242
She'll be back any minute.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.910
Oh, Deej,

10:17.284 --> 10:18.910
look, I'm sorry.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.829
But Vicky and I have a really

10:18.952 --> 10:21.829
special night ahead of us.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.583
I've been planning to be

10:21.871 --> 10:24.583
impetuous for two weeks, now.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.128
Danny, we can always

10:26.042 --> 10:28.128
take a helicopter ride

10:28.169 --> 10:29.837
but Kimmy will

10:28.169 --> 10:29.837
only be 16 once.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.631
Yeah, but she'll be

10:29.879 --> 10:31.631
a sophomore twice.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.970
If my best friend

10:34.759 --> 10:36.970
forgot my 16th birthday

10:37.011 --> 10:38.597
I would have been

10:37.011 --> 10:38.597
devastated.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.265
I know this family.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.475
When someone's in trouble

10:41.516 --> 10:43.143
you all pitch in.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.151
Maybe I'm thinking

10:48.940 --> 10:51.151
of the Walton's.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.779
Oh, Vicky's right.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.779
Deej, count me in.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.823
Thanks, Aunt Becky.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.284
You guys don't want to

10:56.864 --> 10:59.284
see me beg, do you?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.452
I do.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.954
Oh, come on,

11:01.828 --> 11:02.954
she needs our help.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.122
What do you say, guys?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.500
- Alright. I'm in.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.500
- Yeah.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.001
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

11:08.042 --> 11:12.005
My first date,

11:08.042 --> 11:12.005
and it's over like that.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.840
Listen, I'll make it up

11:12.046 --> 11:13.840
to you, I promise.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.425
We don't wanna hurt

11:13.881 --> 11:15.425
Kimmy's feelings, do we?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.388
Michelle..

11:20.430 --> 11:22.641
Okay, I don't want

11:20.430 --> 11:22.641
her to be sad.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.683
That's my girl.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.354
What about

11:24.725 --> 11:27.354
my honey bee house?

11:27.395 --> 11:30.357
Now, we'll j-just make it

11:27.395 --> 11:30.357
a honey bee fence, that's all.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.026
Thanks, you guys.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.819
Now, we have to get started.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.819
What do we do?

11:34.861 --> 11:37.447
Okay, just relax.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.447
All we need is a plan.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.282
Good, good.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.282
Plans are good.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.492
I'll tell you what,

11:39.324 --> 11:40.492
Joey, Rebecca and I

11:40.534 --> 11:42.118
will take care

11:40.534 --> 11:42.118
of decorations.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.163
Good, good. Decorations

11:42.160 --> 11:45.163
are good, just like plans.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.915
Ah, D.J., you, Steph,

11:45.205 --> 11:47.915
and I, we can do the cake.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.461
Good, good, cake is good,

11:47.957 --> 11:51.461
more good stuff.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.629
[chuckles]

11:51.503 --> 11:52.629
Okay, let's get started.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.548
- Thank you.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.548
- Okay.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.049
Okay, boys

11:56.090 --> 11:58.801
we're gonna go

11:56.090 --> 11:58.801
decorate for a party.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.220
- Well?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.220
- Yeah.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.805
'Yeah, actually you look

12:00.261 --> 12:02.805
pretty festive already.'

12:02.847 --> 12:05.058
What do you think?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.685
Come on, boy,

12:05.099 --> 12:06.685
yum, yum, yum.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.769
Look at that.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.769
Red.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.231
Okay, Michelle,

12:08.811 --> 12:11.231
we're on gift patrol.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.857
You mean we're

12:11.272 --> 12:12.857
going shopping?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.275
Yeah, more like rummaging.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.987
Cake, cake, cake.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.155
There's nothing in here.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.365
Who's eating all the food?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.450
Your boyfriend, robo-mouth.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.704
[sighs]

12:23.951 --> 12:25.704
What's in the freezer?

12:25.744 --> 12:28.456
Um, hash brown potatoes

12:25.744 --> 12:28.456
and a box of baking soda.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.125
Kimmy will eat either.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.293
[knock on door]

12:32.335 --> 12:33.587
Oh, no, she's here.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.589
How did she change so fast?

12:35.630 --> 12:36.755
Everybody back in the kitchen.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.425
Kimmy's here.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.801
Everybody. Kimmy's here.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.801
Get down here.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.932
[knock on door]

12:48.226 --> 12:50.311
Surprise!

12:50.353 --> 12:53.189
Wow! You Tanners really

12:50.353 --> 12:53.189
know how to treat a guy.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.567
- Steve. Aw.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.567
- What?

12:55.609 --> 12:57.569
What, too much cologne?

12:57.611 --> 13:00.154
No, Steve, they were

12:57.611 --> 13:00.154
expecting somebody else.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.824
You have another date?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.118
No, no.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.203
I was just so excited

13:05.159 --> 13:07.203
about our anniversary

13:07.245 --> 13:09.830
I completely forgot

13:07.245 --> 13:09.830
it was Kimmy's birthday.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.291
So we're throwing together

13:09.872 --> 13:11.291
this surprise party.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.668
- And you have to help.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.668
- Oh, Deej.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.587
But tonight was gonna

13:13.710 --> 13:15.587
be really special.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.838
Just you and me

13:17.880 --> 13:20.508
a ferry ride

13:17.880 --> 13:20.508
across the bay..

13:20.550 --> 13:23.094
...dinner for two

13:20.550 --> 13:23.094
in Sausalito.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.805
Then we'll hold hands

13:23.136 --> 13:26.805
and walk on the beach.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.016
You can handle the party,

13:26.847 --> 13:29.016
can't you, Steph?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.478
Nice try, Deej.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.440
O-oh, flowers.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.984
We can use these.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.073
[instrumental music]

13:52.165 --> 13:54.292
Here comes Kimmy.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.292
Everyone put on your hats.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.502
[groaning]

13:55.543 --> 13:57.170
The hats, please?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.839
She's here.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.839
Everyone hide.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.550
That's what I always do.

14:07.806 --> 14:08.889
Oh, boy.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.308
It sure is dark in here.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.476
I wonder why.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.979
(all)

14:12.935 --> 14:14.979
Surprise!

14:16.147 --> 14:17.732
All this for<i> moi?</i>

14:17.774 --> 14:19.317
I don't believe it.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.694
Nice hat, Deej.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.114
And, Comet,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.114
you came, too.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.659
All these years,

14:25.156 --> 14:27.659
I thought you hated me.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.076
That was me.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.749
Vicky, so that's why

14:31.454 --> 14:34.749
you flew in, for my birthday.

14:34.791 --> 14:39.253
Well, would I miss the 16th

Gibbler.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.884
Sorry, jet lag.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.803
Wow.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.803
This is some surprise.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.262
You're telling us.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.643
Oh, what's with the Halloween

14:50.598 --> 14:53.643
and Christmas decorations?

14:53.685 --> 14:55.520
Well, well, uh--

14:55.562 --> 14:58.565
See, Kimmy, your birthday is

14:55.562 --> 14:58.565
n-not just a regular birthday.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.859
It's a, it's

14:58.606 --> 15:00.859
a national holiday.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.404
Toilet paper,

15:02.610 --> 15:04.404
how creative.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.698
Oh, yeah, two-ply.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.492
Only the best

15:06.740 --> 15:09.492
for you, Kimmy.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.911
Uh, by the way,

15:09.534 --> 15:11.911
we're all out upstairs.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.164
This is great, Deej.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.833
But where's all our friends?

15:16.875 --> 15:19.085
Oh...well, um..

15:19.126 --> 15:21.379
I thought it would be much

15:19.126 --> 15:21.379
more special to just have

15:21.421 --> 15:23.256
the people who really

15:21.421 --> 15:23.256
care about you.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.636
Do I feel a group hug

15:26.300 --> 15:28.636
coming on?

[beeping]

15:36.603 --> 15:38.354
Oh, cake's ready.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.898
Wait a minute., Vicky.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.898
I'll help.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.066
You baked a cake for me?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.527
Baked, defrosted, whatever.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.823
That's not all.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.823
We even got you presents.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.242
Yeah, you're not an easy person

15:48.865 --> 15:51.242
to shop for, young lady.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.952
You mean rummage.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.163
Well, sit down, Kimmy

15:56.205 --> 15:59.125
a-and happy..

15:56.205 --> 15:59.125
Close your eyes.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.044

16:14.474 --> 16:16.309
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.018
Favorite perfume.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.773
Boy, I-I hope you enjoy it

16:18.060 --> 16:21.773
as much as I did, do.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.065

Uh...yeah, um..

17:12.406 --> 17:15.075
Kimmy, don't you remember

17:12.406 --> 17:15.075
when we were 11

17:15.117 --> 17:17.036
and you ate that

17:15.117 --> 17:17.036
powdered doughnut

17:17.077 --> 17:19.455
and got sugar

17:17.077 --> 17:19.455
all over your lips?

17:19.497 --> 17:21.624
No.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.794
Well, you did and I always meant

17:21.666 --> 17:24.794
to call you sugar lips.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.590
Deej, that is so sweet

17:29.632 --> 17:30.967
and weird.

17:32.343 --> 17:35.680
Happy birthday, Kimmy.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.723
Here you go, Kimmy

17:36.764 --> 17:40.226

17:36.764 --> 17:40.226

17:41.728 --> 17:45.023
With my own special

17:41.728 --> 17:45.023
ketchup frosting.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.317
You made a cake out of my

17:45.105 --> 17:48.317
favorite breakfast side dish.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.195
I'm going to cry.

17:57.535 --> 17:58.786
Thanks, everybody.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.121
Hey, hey, D.J. deserves

17:58.828 --> 18:01.121
all the credit.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.666
Who else could have thrown all

18:01.163 --> 18:03.666
this together in 15 minutes?

18:09.296 --> 18:12.550
Uh, not-not that she did.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.261
But, uh, let's, let's say if

18:12.592 --> 18:15.261
she ever forgot your birthday

18:15.302 --> 18:18.097
and, um, only had 15 minutes

18:18.138 --> 18:19.640
she could have

18:18.138 --> 18:19.640
thrown this together.

Nice save.<i> Not.</i>

18:27.607 --> 18:29.108
Now I get it.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.485
This was a mercy party.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.905
You never planned anything.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.740
You forgot my

18:33.947 --> 18:35.740
birthday, didn't you?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.033
Kimmy, I--

18:37.075 --> 18:39.911
Thanks, everybody.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.911
At least you tried.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.245
It's nice to know

18:39.953 --> 18:41.245
you all care about me

18:41.287 --> 18:43.122
even though

18:41.287 --> 18:43.122
my best friend doesn't.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.672
- Kimmy, I'm sorry.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.672
- Forget it.

18:51.714 --> 18:55.342
Don't you have an

18:51.714 --> 18:55.342
anniversary to celebrate?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.054
I don't understand why

18:55.384 --> 18:58.054
you're so jealous of Steve.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.683
You think I'm jealous?

19:04.226 --> 19:05.812
You don't know me at all.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.984
She left.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.903
- Can you blame her?

19:11.025 --> 19:13.903
- I apologized.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.696
I mean there's no law

19:13.945 --> 19:15.696
that says you have to

19:15.738 --> 19:18.491
throw your friend

19:15.738 --> 19:18.491
a birthday party.

19:18.532 --> 19:22.453
Deej, it's, it's not just

19:18.532 --> 19:22.453
about a birthday party.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.538
You know, since Steve's

19:22.495 --> 19:24.538
been your boyfriend

19:24.580 --> 19:27.041
I think Kimmy's

19:24.580 --> 19:27.041
been left out.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.336
You've been dating

19:28.751 --> 19:30.336
Steve for six months.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.172
You've been friends

19:30.377 --> 19:33.172
with Kimmy for six years.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.465
Seven.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.926
I think you're still

19:34.507 --> 19:36.926
blocking out 1989.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.098
Look, Deej..

19:42.140 --> 19:44.017
..in life,

19:42.140 --> 19:44.017
if you're lucky

19:44.058 --> 19:46.978
you wind up with a few

19:44.058 --> 19:46.978
really good friends.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.229
And for some reason,

19:47.020 --> 19:49.229
beyond my realm of understanding

19:49.271 --> 19:50.481
Kimmy is yours.

19:52.775 --> 19:56.236
Just like Joey

19:52.775 --> 19:56.236
and Jesse are mine.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.823
And w-with friends, you really

19:56.278 --> 19:58.823
have to come through for them.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.075
I mean when I needed Joey and

19:58.865 --> 20:01.075
Jesse to raise you three girls

20:01.117 --> 20:02.952
they were here in a second.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.038
Of course, they didn't know

20:02.994 --> 20:05.038
a diaper from a dinner napkin

20:05.079 --> 20:06.831
which made for some pretty

20:05.079 --> 20:06.831
interesting meals.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.292
But they were here.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.253
And I'd have been

20:10.334 --> 20:13.253
there for them.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.631
And, uh, you ought to be

20:13.295 --> 20:15.631
there for Kimmy.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.721
I'll go next door

20:19.552 --> 20:21.721
and talk to her.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.224
That's my girl.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.560
Okay, you go talk

20:25.265 --> 20:27.560
to Kimmy

20:27.601 --> 20:29.770
and I'll talk to Steve

20:29.812 --> 20:30.897
sugar lips.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.655
What are you doing here?

20:39.697 --> 20:41.032
Well, I can't go home.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.450
My parents think you're

20:41.074 --> 20:43.450
throwing me a party.

20:43.492 --> 20:47.163
I'd look like a dork

20:48.956 --> 20:52.543

20:52.585 --> 20:54.962
It was a lousy thing to do,

20:52.585 --> 20:54.962
and I'll never forgive myself

20:55.004 --> 20:57.464
for hurting your feelings.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.133
Never?

20:59.175 --> 21:00.968
Never.

Will it eat at you till your

21:01.010 --> 21:02.929
tormented night and day

21:02.970 --> 21:06.599
like my dad after

21:02.970 --> 21:06.599
a bunch of bad clams?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.810
Come on, Kimmy,

21:06.640 --> 21:09.810
don't put me through this.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.939
You put me through the most

21:09.852 --> 21:12.939
humiliating night of my life.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.151
You forgot my birthday.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.905
And you accused me of being

21:17.193 --> 21:20.905
jealous of your boyfriend.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.823
I should have

21:20.947 --> 21:22.823
never said that.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.035
That really hurt

21:26.077 --> 21:27.787
because I'm not jealous.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.417
Steve's a great guy,

21:30.873 --> 21:33.417
and I'm happy for you.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.463
I just miss you.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.220
It's like you have

21:41.926 --> 21:44.220
a new best friend.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.851
Kimmy...you are

21:48.015 --> 21:50.851
my best friend.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.937
And you always will be.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.563
T-There are so many things

21:52.979 --> 21:54.563
I can do with you

21:54.605 --> 21:57.316
that I could never

21:54.605 --> 21:57.316
do with Steve.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.609
Like what?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.279
Like talk about Steve.

22:03.072 --> 22:06.117
Steve and I can't go

22:03.072 --> 22:06.117
through each other's closets.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.868

22:10.204 --> 22:11.831
Believe me, Kimmy

22:11.872 --> 22:13.624
no one could

22:11.872 --> 22:13.624
take your place.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.212
I guess I am one of a kind.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.842
Kimmy, you and I

22:21.090 --> 22:22.842
have been best friends

22:22.883 --> 22:24.927
since the day

22:22.883 --> 22:24.927
you moved next door.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.472
I want to stay

22:26.428 --> 22:28.472

22:30.348 --> 22:33.060
You mean it?

22:34.436 --> 22:35.896
Thanks, Deej.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.693
Hey, how about

22:38.983 --> 22:40.693
next Friday night

22:40.734 --> 22:41.861
just you and me?

22:41.902 --> 22:43.445
We'll go out

22:41.902 --> 22:43.445
for your birthday.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.114
Sounds great.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.615
Do you want to go

22:45.156 --> 22:46.615
back to the party?

22:46.657 --> 22:49.327
You think there's any

22:49.367 --> 22:51.871
Oh, I can pretty much
