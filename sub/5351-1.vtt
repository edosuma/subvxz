<i>Don't be lazy, don't be crazy,
get on down to Price-LeBlanc Toyota.</i>

00:31.714 --> 00:35.519
<i>And drive out a Toyota
of your choice at a low price...</i>

00:36.119 --> 00:38.286
<i>And we can top that...</i>

02:11.980 --> 02:15.051
- I don't have a husband.
- <i>Borracha! Vieja loca!</i>

02:15.151 --> 02:18.555
Speak English...
Get the hell outta here...

02:18.655 --> 02:22.390
You move the truck!
Who died and made you boss?

02:26.261 --> 02:30.499
- <i>He had a bad hanging-by-his-hair day.
- Oh, that's Absalom...</i>

02:33.603 --> 02:35.472
<i>You got the spoon in.</i>

02:35.572 --> 02:37.574
<i>He got rocked literally.</i>

02:37.874 --> 02:39.107
<i>You've got it, sister.</i>

02:43.312 --> 02:44.998
Manglehorn Lock and Key.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.481
You got your kid in there.

02:50.786 --> 02:52.407
Yeah.

02:57.859 --> 03:01.097
Oh, look at this car.
How'd he get in there?

03:01.197 --> 03:02.999
Hey, boy.

03:03.099 --> 03:07.237
Okay, you know, your car is filthy.
Your car is really dirty.

03:07.337 --> 03:10.394
<i>Sucio. Sucio.</i> You can't do that.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.977
Yeah, you gotta take care
of these things, you know?

03:14.577 --> 03:18.108
Your kid locked in a filthy car.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.189
Let me see this.

03:21.480 --> 03:26.389
How you doing there?
Being a big shot with those keys?

03:26.489 --> 03:28.923
Here we go. We got it.

03:40.602 --> 03:41.970
You okay?

03:45.275 --> 03:47.777
Now, he doesn't wanna come out.
Look at him.

03:47.877 --> 03:48.912
He looks happy.

03:49.012 --> 03:53.147
20... 20... 26. 30 will do.
It's fine for me.

03:54.116 --> 03:56.186
You're too kind.

03:56.286 --> 03:59.790
Take care of your car. Okay?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.492
- <i>Sucio.</i>
- <i>Gracias.</i>

04:02.592 --> 04:04.659
<i>Limpia. Limpia.</i> Okay?

04:07.829 --> 04:09.061
<i>De nada.</i>

04:17.072 --> 04:19.108
<i>Dear Clara...</i>

04:20.108 --> 04:23.313
<i>Clara, how I missed you.</i>

04:24.013 --> 04:28.209
<i>You know, not a day goes by
when I don't miss you deeply...</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:31.021
<i>without you to hold my hand</i>

04:31.121 --> 04:35.289
<i>to look at me with those
life-affirming eyes.</i>

04:37.426 --> 04:40.018
<i>Those eyes...</i>

04:40.597 --> 04:43.866
<i>you could save the world
with those eyes.</i>

04:43.966 --> 04:46.901
<i>You could've stopped evil
dead in its tracks...</i>

04:48.604 --> 04:51.138
<i>if it looked in your eyes.</i>

04:53.075 --> 04:55.810
<i>Trouble never saw it coming.</i>

04:58.947 --> 05:03.019
<i>I just want you to look at me
one more time.</i>

05:03.419 --> 05:08.092
<i>Never have I felt more alive
than when you looked at me.</i>

05:09.592 --> 05:12.526
<i>I mean, I could always feel it.</i>

05:13.562 --> 05:16.633
<i>I'd give up everything...</i>

05:16.733 --> 05:19.273
<i>for one more glance.</i>

05:20.269 --> 05:22.939
<i>I'm a wounded man, Clara.</i>

05:23.039 --> 05:27.474
<i>I got... real pain in my heart.</i>

05:28.944 --> 05:31.097
<i>Look at me.</i>

05:31.197 --> 05:35.802
<i>Everybody's here
looking at me except you.</i>

05:35.902 --> 05:39.389
<i>These people in my life standin' here...</i>

05:39.489 --> 05:42.425
<i>they're waiting for something from me.</i>

05:42.525 --> 05:45.261
<i>They're waiting for a miracle.</i>

05:45.361 --> 05:48.097
<i>They want something...</i>

05:48.197 --> 05:51.239
<i>or they're just passin' through.</i>

05:51.968 --> 05:54.170
<i>People everywhere...</i>

05:54.270 --> 05:56.172
<i>but none of them...</i>

05:56.272 --> 05:58.643
<i>mean a thing to me.</i>

05:58.875 --> 06:02.078
<i>They're not gonna distract me
away from you.</i>

06:02.178 --> 06:04.560
<i>They're just not...</i>

06:06.416 --> 06:08.840
<i>'cause I bet on you.</i>

07:24.426 --> 07:26.796
Mornin', Carl. What's shakin'?

07:26.896 --> 07:28.298
Lookin' left, lookin' right.

07:28.398 --> 07:30.366
- Oh, you're tellin' me.
- I know that's right.

07:30.466 --> 07:32.640
Morning, Mr. Manglehorn.
How are you doing today, sir?

07:32.740 --> 07:35.405
Hey, Steve, there you are.

07:35.505 --> 07:37.840
There's a doughnut.

07:37.940 --> 07:41.044
I'm not gonna breathe
a word of this to Collette.

07:41.144 --> 07:44.614
She will not know which night
I'm gonna be there.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.483
- It's so exciting.
- Oh, thank you.

07:47.583 --> 07:50.820
It'll be a great surprise for her.
Good job, Dawn. We'll see you later.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.968
I'll see you later.

07:54.122 --> 07:55.358
- Well.
- Ma'am.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.560
- So, how's it going?
- I've got a little grandbaby.

07:57.660 --> 08:00.760
Oh, my gosh. That is so exciting.

08:00.860 --> 08:03.796
- 8 pounds 3 ounces.
- My gosh. That could hurt.

08:03.896 --> 08:06.399
- Well, I don't know.
- She's like my size.

08:06.499 --> 08:08.368
I'll take the next guest down here.

08:08.468 --> 08:10.136
Having a new baby is just so exciting.

08:10.236 --> 08:12.272
The next guest... Hi. How are you?

08:12.372 --> 08:15.808
That's great. Oh. Oh. Lawrence.

08:15.908 --> 08:18.011
Oh, yes. Thank you.

08:18.111 --> 08:19.512
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

08:19.612 --> 08:22.081
Are we okay? You have room for me now?

08:22.181 --> 08:24.450
- Good morning.
- How are you doing, Dawn?

08:24.550 --> 08:25.652
Lady?

08:25.752 --> 08:28.087
It's not even 11
and I'm already starving.

08:28.187 --> 08:30.690
- Don't tell me.
- It's gonna be a long day. I can tell you.

08:30.790 --> 08:34.360
I'd give you this, but it's kinda stale.
Maybe I go get you a Danish over there.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.361
I've already had two.

08:36.462 --> 08:38.664
Two, my limit.

08:38.764 --> 08:41.962
- Chief got back from the vet yesterday.
- Well.

08:42.802 --> 08:46.706
- Little guy's gonna have to wear a cone.
- No. Oh, gee, that's awful. That thing...

08:46.806 --> 08:48.597
I know.

08:49.497 --> 08:52.145
Poor baby. Look at him. Oh, gee.

08:52.245 --> 08:54.380
How is Fannie?

08:54.480 --> 08:58.651
Oh, not too... I don't know.
She's seen better days, like me.

08:58.751 --> 09:03.523
She just won't eat.
She eats grass and then spits it out.

09:03.623 --> 09:05.558
I don't know what to do.

09:05.658 --> 09:10.029
There they are, all over the world,
the scoundrels, the lowlifes and...

09:10.129 --> 09:12.596
pets get stepped on.

09:16.701 --> 09:19.769
- Here you go.
- Okay.

09:21.006 --> 09:23.276
- Well...
- I'll see you next Friday.

09:23.376 --> 09:26.910
You bet. Hopefully. Yeah.

10:01.046 --> 10:02.725
Fannie?

10:32.410 --> 10:35.189
Honey, you around?

10:35.914 --> 10:37.750
Yeah.

10:37.850 --> 10:40.279
I know you're somewhere.

10:41.152 --> 10:43.422
Somewhere might be here.

10:43.522 --> 10:45.321
Fannie?

10:45.757 --> 10:48.528
So you're still all plugged up?

10:48.628 --> 10:50.950
Come on in, honey.

10:55.367 --> 10:58.004
I'm not gonna give you too much, just...

10:58.104 --> 11:01.806
just a taste, just a little taste.

11:05.545 --> 11:07.813
How'd you get in there again?

11:07.913 --> 11:11.350
Fannie, I know. You did it again.

11:11.450 --> 11:13.886
How do you get in here?

11:13.986 --> 11:16.289
You use your paws.

11:16.389 --> 11:18.624
You get in with your paws.

11:18.724 --> 11:21.327
I mean, where'd you learn that?

11:21.427 --> 11:23.618
You're Houdini.

11:24.430 --> 11:27.633
Alright, look at this.
I'm gonna eat too.

11:27.733 --> 11:30.269
See? I got fruit.

11:30.369 --> 11:32.071
Nice prunes...

11:32.171 --> 11:35.141
and you got... What do you got?

11:35.241 --> 11:36.976
You got nothin'.

11:37.076 --> 11:40.613
You got nothin', I got nothin'.
I'm starvin'.

11:40.713 --> 11:43.583
Oh, we got taco shells

11:43.683 --> 11:46.352
and pussy cat food.

11:48.953 --> 11:50.189
Damn it!

11:50.289 --> 11:52.492
- Meat, sir?
- Yeah, liver and onions.

11:52.592 --> 11:55.027
Okay. Any sides?

11:55.127 --> 11:57.830
- Mashed potatoes.
- Okay.

11:57.930 --> 12:00.500
- Brown gravy.
- Okay.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.169
- Green beans.
- Alright.

12:03.269 --> 12:06.537
- There we go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:09.374 --> 12:13.179
<i>I just want to know
where you are right now.</i>

12:13.579 --> 12:16.482
<i>Where you are, what you're doin',
that's all I wanna know.</i>

12:16.582 --> 12:19.652
Everybody loves fried chicken.
Chicken tenders. We have roast chicken.

12:19.752 --> 12:22.088
Any kind of chicken you'd like.
Black-eyed peas.

12:22.188 --> 12:25.591
Everybody loves those. Candied yams,
soups. We have vegetable soups...

12:25.691 --> 12:29.193
<i>There's always tomorrow,
but I tell you, Clara...</i>

12:30.729 --> 12:34.333
<i>I'm losing hope in tomorrow.</i>

12:34.433 --> 12:37.536
And, of course, everybody's specialty...
macaroni and cheese.

12:37.636 --> 12:40.306
Peas and carrots, cabbage,
squash, and...

12:40.406 --> 12:42.341
<i>It hurts...</i>

12:42.441 --> 12:44.968
<i>day in, day out.</i>

12:45.510 --> 12:48.014
<i>And beautiful memories of you</i>

12:48.114 --> 12:50.650
<i>walking toward me.</i>

12:50.950 --> 12:54.787
<i>Just one... painful</i>

12:54.887 --> 12:57.535
<i>constant reminder</i>

12:58.858 --> 13:01.093
<i>there's no one like you.</i>

13:01.193 --> 13:04.795
<i>None of them can hold a candle to you.</i>

13:06.831 --> 13:08.701
<i>You remember how you used to whisper</i>

13:08.801 --> 13:12.071
<i>about the future to me
right before we'd fall asleep?</i>

13:12.171 --> 13:14.561
<i>I always liked that.</i>

13:15.574 --> 13:18.509
<i>You are a fortune teller...</i>

13:19.011 --> 13:21.527
<i>and a mind reader.</i>

13:22.214 --> 13:25.724
<i>And you were my own private president.</i>

13:33.825 --> 13:35.526
Yes.

13:36.294 --> 13:38.129
Big money.

13:38.563 --> 13:41.028
You got that wrong, hon?

13:42.934 --> 13:45.471
Manglehorn. Hey, coach.

13:45.571 --> 13:47.488
Hit the jackpot?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.208
- That's it.
- Yeah.

13:49.308 --> 13:54.347
Here comes that damn Gary. He just
makes me so nervous I could spit.

13:54.447 --> 13:56.783
- I'll catch you around after a while.
- Okay.

13:56.883 --> 14:00.286
- Remember, today is your lucky day.
- Alright.

14:00.386 --> 14:04.056
Manglehorn! Manglehorny,
it's good to see you.

14:04.156 --> 14:06.292
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah. Good seeing you, Gary.

14:06.392 --> 14:08.261
Long time no see, man.
Can I get you a drink?

14:08.361 --> 14:09.929
You guys know each other?

14:10.029 --> 14:11.497
- No.
- Hey, hi.

14:11.597 --> 14:13.833
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14:13.933 --> 14:16.636
Check it out. That's Jasmine.
She's the new girl that works with me.

14:16.736 --> 14:19.803
- She is fresh.
- Yeah.

14:20.172 --> 14:21.907
- I know.
- It's been a while, man.

14:22.007 --> 14:24.410
It has, Gary. It has. You know.

14:24.510 --> 14:26.646
I'm doing alright, you know,
just hangin' in.

14:26.746 --> 14:28.447
Just trying to play a game here.

14:28.547 --> 14:30.383
- There you go.
- Okay, take care.

14:30.483 --> 14:32.351
When are you gonna come down
check out the new salon?

14:32.451 --> 14:34.554
- Salon?
- You didn't know?

14:34.654 --> 14:38.724
Oh, my God, I got 3, 4, 5,
6 tanning beds now.

14:38.824 --> 14:41.460
- That's good for you then.
- We do massages. It's more than good.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.763
It's excellent.
Oh, speaking of which, check this out.

14:43.863 --> 14:46.866
You know, I do 6000 crunches a day

14:46.966 --> 14:49.135
just for this card. Here, check it out.

14:49.235 --> 14:51.370
I look like a Lebanese strong man.

14:51.470 --> 14:53.005
- Got some nice tits in there.
- You do.

14:53.105 --> 14:54.774
Just had it made, homie.

14:54.874 --> 14:57.076
Beautiful photo. Really good.

14:57.176 --> 15:01.214
No, seriously, come on, man.
I miss you. Come on down, take a look.

15:01.314 --> 15:04.019
- Yeah, alright, Gary.
- We're doing massages now. Real ho stuff.

15:04.119 --> 15:06.919
- Thanks, Jasmine.
- Here you go.

15:07.019 --> 15:09.388
- Oh, well, thank you. Thank you, dear.
- You're welcome.

15:09.488 --> 15:10.990
Good stuff, man, good stuff.

15:11.090 --> 15:14.960
Anyway, Jasmine, this dude is a hero.
He was my little league baseball coach.

15:15.060 --> 15:17.863
Probably the greatest genius
of little league of all time.

15:17.963 --> 15:22.201
And he had his little kid, Jacob Manglehorn
his son, was almost retarded.

15:22.301 --> 15:26.020
The dude had like a hunchback, crow's feet,
always sweating twitchin' out, nervous.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.140
He used to walk like a monkey.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.655
We always thought he was
a queer bait but in truth,

15:30.755 --> 15:33.579
he was just a little guy kinda confused,
and I feel bad about it

15:33.679 --> 15:36.215
kinda like a little
Michael J. Fox bowl cut.

15:36.315 --> 15:37.283
What am I gonna do...

15:37.383 --> 15:40.886
Anyway, coach, I heard he's doin' good,
your son. I heard he's rich. Is that true?

15:40.986 --> 15:44.290
Yeah, he's a real stud.
A real son of a prick.

15:44.390 --> 15:47.727
That's how it goes, my man!
All those nerds in high school.

15:47.827 --> 15:49.188
They read all those books,

15:49.288 --> 15:52.164
page 1, chapter 6. I have no idea
what the hell you're talking about.

15:52.264 --> 15:55.401
Gary. Gary. You wanna shut up, Gary?

15:55.501 --> 15:58.638
- Okay? Just tone it down a little.
- Nothin'. Nothin' resonates.

15:58.738 --> 16:01.273
Anyway, coach...
sorry about rambling, man.

16:01.373 --> 16:04.310
You know, it's okay, Gary.
Listen, do me a favor.

16:04.410 --> 16:07.513
I like... I enjoy seein' you,
just leave me alone now.

16:07.613 --> 16:08.781
- Alright, man.
- Yeah.

16:08.881 --> 16:13.919
No problem. Sorry to impede on your...
good fortune, but it's good to see you too.

16:14.019 --> 16:15.855
I would be honored, if maybe tonight...

16:15.955 --> 16:17.890
you wanted to kick it with me
and some of the homies.

16:17.990 --> 16:21.660
I got this mulatto friend who'd just won
a half a million dollars in the Lotto.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.947
- Not tonight, Gary.
- Alright... anyway.

16:25.047 --> 16:26.832
Come have a drink, my man.

16:26.932 --> 16:30.067
I appreciate it.
I take it as a compliment.

16:30.268 --> 16:32.004
<i>Dear, Clara...</i>

16:32.104 --> 16:36.588
<i>I've made so many mistakes and now
I look around and everything's gone.</i>

16:37.376 --> 16:39.745
<i>Why didn't I stay with you?</i>

16:39.845 --> 16:41.881
<i>I'm a fool.</i>

16:41.981 --> 16:44.884
<i>The only thing I wanna do
anymore is love you.</i>

16:44.984 --> 16:46.252
I love you, coach.

16:46.352 --> 16:51.090
<i>Even thinkin' those words
makes my heart pound.</i>

16:51.190 --> 16:53.893
<i>Maybe tomorrow, I'll drive
my beat-up old van home</i>

16:53.993 --> 16:56.762
<i>and there you'll be
waitin' for me with a smile</i>

16:56.862 --> 16:59.432
<i>and a wink and I'll be okay.</i>

16:59.532 --> 17:02.101
<i>Maybe you're looking for me too.</i>

17:02.201 --> 17:06.338
<i>I'm a silly man with stupid dreams?</i>

17:06.438 --> 17:10.874
<i>You gave me my chance,
and I put it out with the wash.</i>

17:58.324 --> 18:03.028
My coach, my old coach.
Coach Manglehorn, a living legend!

18:03.428 --> 18:05.329
Let's turn it up. Coach.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.832
Loosen up.

18:18.243 --> 18:21.735
Coach, how could you not love this?
You were a star, coach. You were beautiful.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.518
What happened to you?
All slumped over. Where's the life?

18:25.618 --> 18:28.521
You were a genius.
We all wanted to be like you, coach.

18:28.621 --> 18:31.624
We wanted to walk like you.
You were the greatest ever!

18:31.724 --> 18:34.059
- Gary, you look good. You look good.
- Coach, you can hear me.

18:34.159 --> 18:36.528
Don't pretend to be deaf,
you're not that old.

18:36.628 --> 18:40.332
Everyone loved you. The way you moved,
the way you walked, the way you talked.

18:40.432 --> 18:41.934
You were smooth.

18:42.034 --> 18:45.836
Live in the moment!
Yeah, live in the moment!

19:56.707 --> 20:01.213
Oh, Fannie, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you last night.

20:01.613 --> 20:05.149
Well, what am I gonna do?
Sometimes I just get crazy.

20:05.883 --> 20:08.489
I broke the toaster, too.

20:09.188 --> 20:12.624
Come on, baby, eat your food.

20:12.724 --> 20:14.658
Nice and tasty.

20:30.174 --> 20:32.377
That's what I'm talking about.

20:32.477 --> 20:35.948
I'm looking at it now.
It's beautiful, yeah.

20:36.648 --> 20:38.382
Yeah.

20:40.718 --> 20:45.796
Yeah, look, it's not an offer that's gonna
stay on the table longer than 24 hours.

20:46.591 --> 20:50.262
I understand. Yes, I understand.

20:50.362 --> 20:52.831
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's in for 3 mill.

20:52.931 --> 20:56.001
I... yes, that's not the way this goes.

20:56.101 --> 20:58.170
The way this goes down,
you count yourself lucky

20:58.270 --> 21:01.417
for finding me at this time in your life
because you have a chance right now,

21:01.517 --> 21:05.044
right this second
to be so rich, it's sick.

21:05.644 --> 21:07.713
It's sick.

21:08.013 --> 21:10.549
Stan, I don't convince...
That's not what I do.

21:10.649 --> 21:12.851
You should convince me
why I should invest for you.

21:12.951 --> 21:15.568
You understand?
Does that make sense to you?

21:15.988 --> 21:19.558
Look, I'm gonna count to 10. I don't
have time for this. I gotta go lunch.

21:19.658 --> 21:23.095
I come back on the phone, I want a yes.
If I don't hear a yes, the offer's gone.

21:23.195 --> 21:26.679
You don't call me back in 5 minutes you don't
call me back in 3 minutes. You got it?

21:26.779 --> 21:29.466
Start the countdown. 10.

21:39.643 --> 21:41.634
What is it?

21:42.347 --> 21:45.584
Bingo. Great. I'm proud of you, Stan.

21:45.684 --> 21:47.899
We'll go from there. Great work.

21:47.999 --> 21:49.946
Okay.

21:50.521 --> 21:55.461
Sorry about that, Dad.
Just... real idiot.

21:55.561 --> 21:59.464
But he went for it, you know, so...
He's a good guy, He's a... he'll learn.

21:59.564 --> 22:01.767
How you doin'? How you been?

22:01.867 --> 22:03.501
Great.

22:04.636 --> 22:06.605
- Good. Yeah.
- Good?

22:06.705 --> 22:09.239
Yeah. Great.

22:14.745 --> 22:16.615
What the hell's that?

22:16.715 --> 22:20.103
My friend, the elephant.

22:20.719 --> 22:22.307
He's lookin' at you.

22:24.189 --> 22:26.392
That's some elephant.

22:26.592 --> 22:29.194
It doesn't... I don't know,
look like an elephant, Dad.

22:29.294 --> 22:31.617
Well, it depends, you know.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.036
From where I'm sitting here now,
looking down?

22:34.136 --> 22:38.003
- Yeah.
- He does look a little like a baby elephant.

22:38.103 --> 22:42.406
But, you know, that's...
neither here nor there?

22:43.708 --> 22:45.444
You like it?

22:45.544 --> 22:47.997
So you workin'?

22:48.097 --> 22:51.617
Yeah, I'm working. Sure. Of course.

22:51.717 --> 22:53.185
Work is good?

22:53.285 --> 22:57.122
Work is alright.
You know, it's what I do.

22:57.222 --> 22:58.590
- Workin'.
- Yeah.

22:58.690 --> 23:00.638
That's what we do, right?

23:03.294 --> 23:05.063
Why'd you come see me?

23:05.163 --> 23:07.265
Do you need some money?

23:07.365 --> 23:08.400
No.

23:08.500 --> 23:12.871
- I'll give you a loan if you need one...
- No, I don't need your money. Come on.

23:12.971 --> 23:14.613
I just came to see my son, you know.

23:15.053 --> 23:17.619
I mean, you're never ringin' my doorbell
so every once in a while

23:17.719 --> 23:19.478
I come around, ring yours.

23:19.578 --> 23:21.780
- That's all.
- Yeah.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.129
You do what you wanna do
with your money.

23:24.229 --> 23:25.984
You take care of yourself

23:26.084 --> 23:30.288
and you take care of my granddaughter
with your money.

23:30.388 --> 23:32.435
Because that's what your money's for.

23:33.208 --> 23:36.128
- What does Kylie have to do with anything?
- It's got everything to do with her.

23:36.228 --> 23:39.332
You don't want her slippin'
through the cracks now, do you?

23:40.132 --> 23:43.769
You gotta give her
all the love she needs.

23:44.169 --> 23:47.014
- Yeah.
- Even if you have to pay for it.

23:47.972 --> 23:50.447
That's what it is.

23:51.076 --> 23:53.509
- That's great advice.
- Well...

23:54.433 --> 23:55.747
You know who I saw?

23:55.847 --> 23:57.883
- Who's that?
- I ran into Gary.

23:57.983 --> 24:00.285
- Gary who?
- He asked for you.

24:00.385 --> 24:04.676
Gary, you know, old Gary...
Baseball Gary. Remember?

24:05.176 --> 24:06.725
What's his last name?

24:06.825 --> 24:07.993
- Hodges?
- Yeah.

24:08.093 --> 24:09.595
- Gary Hodges.
- Yeah, there it is.

24:09.695 --> 24:11.430
You keep in contact
with Gary Hodges. Why?

24:11.530 --> 24:15.033
I don't keep contact with him, I just...
now and then I run into them.

24:15.133 --> 24:19.536
He's got this successful salon
he's put together.

24:22.073 --> 24:24.243
See. There it is. He's a good kid.

24:24.343 --> 24:26.578
You gotta be kidding me.

24:26.678 --> 24:30.015
Well, he's doing nice.

24:30.115 --> 24:32.251
- Tan-Man? Nice?
- His own business.

24:32.351 --> 24:33.885
Okay, this guy was a drug addict.

24:33.985 --> 24:35.821
Do you remember that?
Gary was a drug addict.

24:35.921 --> 24:38.624
Yeah, I do. I remember it.
He's not a drug addict anymore.

24:38.724 --> 24:43.095
He's got a good head on his shoulders.
He's... you know...

24:43.195 --> 24:45.997
We have the same taste in music.

24:46.097 --> 24:49.594
And... also modern art.

24:49.694 --> 24:51.703
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:51.803 --> 24:56.122
- You up on modern art?
- I don't give a shit about modern art.

24:56.222 --> 24:57.641
I wonder why.

25:03.581 --> 25:07.718
You know what? Here's the thing.
I'm just gonna be honest with you.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.027
Gary...

25:12.590 --> 25:15.418
he doesn't mean anything to me.
Okay? I beat Gary.

25:15.518 --> 25:18.564
I beat him long ago. While he was
washing cars you know what I was doing?

25:18.664 --> 25:20.666
I was putting myself
through college, Dad, okay?

25:20.766 --> 25:23.685
While he's running a tanning salon,
you know what I'm doing?

25:23.785 --> 25:25.254
I'm trading commodities with giants.

25:25.404 --> 25:28.340
So if you wanna parade Gary in front of me
as one of your accomplishments, Dad,

25:28.440 --> 25:30.442
I'm not... I'm telling you
I'm not impressed.

25:30.542 --> 25:32.745
Are you gonna talk like a jerk now?

25:33.245 --> 25:35.647
Is this what our conversation's
gonna be?

25:35.747 --> 25:38.850
Because if I wanna hang around
with a jerk, I'd just go...

25:38.950 --> 25:41.720
oh, look in the mirror...

25:42.420 --> 25:43.488
talk to myself.

25:43.588 --> 25:45.691
I didn't mean, I'm not trying
to be a jerk, okay?

25:45.791 --> 25:48.126
I just don't know why you always have
to compare me to everybody else.

25:48.226 --> 25:51.428
I'm glad of that. This food stinks.

25:52.363 --> 25:54.266
- It's awful.
- It's expensive food.

25:54.366 --> 25:57.002
- I don't care how much it costs.
- Eat it, Dad.

25:57.402 --> 26:01.373
Menu, pretentious.
Conversations are pretentious.

26:01.473 --> 26:04.474
This whole place, overpriced.

26:04.909 --> 26:07.112
Emperor's new clothes right here.

26:07.212 --> 26:09.014
- Don't eat it then.
- It won't be eaten.

26:09.114 --> 26:11.450
- I don't care. Don't eat it.
- Guaranteed.

26:11.550 --> 26:12.918
Everything okay, Mr. Manglehorn?

26:13.018 --> 26:16.529
Oh, it's terrific, Rudolfo.
Thank you, we're just...

26:16.955 --> 26:18.573
- just having a conversation.
- Rudolfo,

26:18.673 --> 26:21.460
I would like a piece
of chocolate cake if you got it.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.896
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Thank you.

26:23.996 --> 26:25.797
And take this, Rudolf.
He's not gonna eat it.

26:25.897 --> 26:28.198
- Okay.
- Thank you.

26:29.700 --> 26:32.437
Never easy with you. It's never.

26:33.566 --> 26:35.974
Never easy. Of course, never.

26:36.074 --> 26:37.876
Dad, I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna do it.

26:37.976 --> 26:40.545
So you talk to Mom lately?
How's she doing?

26:40.645 --> 26:42.834
I don't talk to her.

26:43.882 --> 26:46.089
I never loved your mother.

26:46.718 --> 26:50.135
The woman I loved slipped away,
I let it happen.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.437
Got my priorities screwed up.

26:52.537 --> 26:56.908
My vision of what I wanted in life.

26:57.008 --> 26:59.911
- Well, that's too bad.
- Yeah.

27:00.011 --> 27:02.481
- That's really too bad.
- Yeah.

27:02.581 --> 27:04.616
Guess things change.

27:04.716 --> 27:07.984
You know, I don't know, maybe this
other woman maybe she'll return and...

27:08.084 --> 27:11.456
then maybe you'll remember how
to love someone more than an animal.

27:11.556 --> 27:12.815
You don't know love.

27:12.915 --> 27:17.028
- Don't tell me I don't know what love is.
- You don't know. You're a son of mine.

27:17.128 --> 27:19.319
You should know these things.

27:21.732 --> 27:24.936
- I got a lot of work to do, Dad, so...
- Oh, what else?

27:25.036 --> 27:27.238
It was great seeing you.

27:28.089 --> 27:30.242
Leave this for Rudolf.

27:30.342 --> 27:32.963
- Keep the rest for yourself.
- I don't need it.

27:33.063 --> 27:35.779
Great seeing you, Dad. Really great.

27:38.816 --> 27:40.843
Your cake, sir.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.244
Yeah, I like it a la mode.

27:45.322 --> 27:47.505
- Will do, sir.
- That means...

27:47.605 --> 27:48.560
Ice cream.

27:48.660 --> 27:52.063
Get rid of that orange stuff
on the side, please.

27:52.163 --> 27:53.997
Yes, sir.

28:00.370 --> 28:03.074
Go ahead, don't you like the ice cream?

28:03.174 --> 28:04.476
- Yeah.
- How is it?

28:04.576 --> 28:08.647
It's good. But do you know
what my favorite flavor is?

28:09.521 --> 28:12.517
- Chicken.
- Chicken ice cream?

28:12.617 --> 28:17.455
That's confusing.
I like... I like vanilla.

28:17.555 --> 28:19.958
Vanilla? That's really confusing.

28:20.158 --> 28:24.489
- That's a strange flavor for ice cream.
- No, it's not.

28:25.230 --> 28:29.434
Well, it's kinda confusing
how the leaves change color.

28:29.534 --> 28:31.002
- It is.
- How do they do that?

28:31.102 --> 28:34.573
Well, you see, something happens
in nature because...

28:34.673 --> 28:38.143
- I think fairies do it.
- Oh, you think the fairies do it.

28:38.243 --> 28:40.545
Well, sure, why wouldn't they?

28:40.645 --> 28:43.915
What do you think
the fairies do to the leaves?

28:44.015 --> 28:47.953
They paint them and then they
jump on them like trampoline

28:48.053 --> 28:50.587
so they look like they're gonna fall.

28:52.770 --> 28:56.159
You know, I once read a poem...

28:56.660 --> 28:59.297
and it went like this.

28:59.397 --> 29:02.333
Nobody knows the wind...

29:02.433 --> 29:05.203
neither you nor I.

29:05.303 --> 29:10.306
But when the leaves
bow down their heads...

29:10.407 --> 29:13.476
the wind is passing by.

29:13.744 --> 29:15.480
- Get that?
- Yeah.

29:15.580 --> 29:18.786
- You want to say it with me?
- But in pictures...

29:18.886 --> 29:20.800
you can see the wind.

29:20.919 --> 29:25.023
It looks like this.
It's a straight line and then a curl.

29:25.123 --> 29:27.759
- Yeah.
- A straight line and a curl.

29:27.859 --> 29:30.895
And a straight line, curve, curl.

29:30.995 --> 29:33.665
- And you can see that?
- Yeah.

29:33.765 --> 29:36.588
You're special. I can see that.

29:36.688 --> 29:38.169
Okay, here comes the sneeze.

29:38.269 --> 29:41.239
Now, if I sneeze three times
then you go down.

29:41.339 --> 29:43.074
Let me see your sneeze first.

29:53.751 --> 29:56.421
Yeah. That was good.

29:56.521 --> 29:57.556
- This is fun.
- You see that?

29:57.656 --> 29:59.758
- Once you start, you can't stop.
- Do you wanna do it?

29:59.858 --> 30:02.533
Just keep going, yeah.

30:03.061 --> 30:06.498
You better let your balloon go, honey,
before we get home.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.333
Why?

30:08.433 --> 30:13.671
Well, I don't know. You know, balloon
belongs in the sky where it came from.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.473
- Right?
- Yeah.

30:15.573 --> 30:17.876
- I guess.
- So it's lonely.

30:17.976 --> 30:20.612
Homesick. That's right. Oh, that's good.

30:20.712 --> 30:24.449
Look. Thanks for hangin' with us.

30:24.949 --> 30:27.524
- Come on. You wanna drive this time?
- No.

30:27.624 --> 30:31.223
Why not? You know,
I gotta do everything.

30:31.723 --> 30:35.392
- Bye-bye, grandpa.
- Bye-bye, Kylie.

30:35.859 --> 30:39.197
- I love you very much.
- I love you too. Thank you for my lion.

30:39.297 --> 30:43.066
Oh, there was nothing to it.
See you next week.

30:44.168 --> 30:45.937
Thank you, Patricia.

30:46.037 --> 30:49.334
Thank you, mister. See you next time.

32:01.812 --> 32:05.383
You know, I remember one time...

32:05.783 --> 32:08.920
that we went to the rodeo with your dad

32:09.020 --> 32:12.824
and your <i>abuelo</i> and me and you.

32:12.924 --> 32:14.392
- Do you remember?
- No.

32:14.492 --> 32:18.430
Well, we went to that rodeo
and there was this bull.

32:18.530 --> 32:22.634
The longhorn bull.
It was... it was really big.

32:22.734 --> 32:25.904
He jumped the fence into the ring

32:26.004 --> 32:28.907
and he started jumping
and throwing things

32:29.007 --> 32:32.277
and the clown went running
and everybody was running

32:32.377 --> 32:35.413
and everybody was
so afraid of this thing

32:35.513 --> 32:39.484
and nobody knew what to do,
the vets couldn't help him

32:39.584 --> 32:43.989
and the poor bull was suffering
and suffering and...

32:44.489 --> 32:49.661
Mr. Manglehorn clapped
his hand two times...

32:49.761 --> 32:52.030
and walked to him...

32:52.130 --> 32:55.233
put his hand like that next to the bull

32:55.333 --> 32:59.704
and the bull with his big, big paw

32:59.804 --> 33:02.674
put it on top of the hand

33:02.774 --> 33:07.676
and the nail that was hurting him
so bad and nobody realized,

33:07.776 --> 33:12.015
went straight to <i>abuelo's</i> hand.

33:12.216 --> 33:13.384
- Cool.
- Yeah.

33:13.484 --> 33:17.522
And then the bull was good
and relaxed again.

33:17.622 --> 33:22.594
- That's why I love grandpa.
- Well, we all love grandpas.

33:22.694 --> 33:24.062
<i>Abuelos.</i>

33:24.162 --> 33:27.597
- <i>Abuelos.</i>
- <i>Abuelos</i> are really good.

35:39.029 --> 35:43.601
Can you hear me talking to you, ma'am?
Are you hurting anywhere, ma'am?

35:43.701 --> 35:46.022
You know what happened?

36:17.200 --> 36:19.540
- Mr. Manglehorn, good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

36:19.640 --> 36:23.139
- Yes, sir. Have a seat please.
- Yeah.

36:23.974 --> 36:25.376
Sure.

36:25.476 --> 36:29.981
I've got some interesting things
to share with you about Ms. Fannie.

36:30.081 --> 36:33.150
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Yes.

36:33.730 --> 36:38.556
Her vomiting... and lack of appetite...

36:38.656 --> 36:41.859
is resulting from a problem
in her small intestine.

36:41.959 --> 36:44.429
She has swallowed a foreign object.

36:44.529 --> 36:46.998
She has an obstruction...

36:47.098 --> 36:51.402
that... is not allowing
the normal peristalsis

36:51.502 --> 36:53.604
of the smooth muscle to continue.

36:53.704 --> 36:57.208
- What could that object be?
- Well, that's a good question.

36:57.308 --> 37:00.778
And I'm sure you'll be able
to recognize it quite easily.

37:01.491 --> 37:05.416
How she swallowed that,
I don't know but there it is.

37:05.516 --> 37:09.320
And so what we're gonna need
to do is a laparotomy.

37:09.420 --> 37:12.323
It's in a actually a very good position.

37:12.423 --> 37:14.125
It passed through her stomach

37:14.225 --> 37:17.295
through her pylorus
and it's in the upper part

37:17.395 --> 37:20.665
of what we call the duodenum
of the small intestine.

37:20.765 --> 37:24.569
This is a... another chart
showing, in this instance

37:24.669 --> 37:29.140
a foreign object, which is a ball
that's in this animal's intestine.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.909
Even in a sterile surgical setting

37:32.009 --> 37:35.079
there's bacteria at work in the GI tract

37:35.179 --> 37:37.682
so we're gonna need
to compensate for that.

37:37.782 --> 37:39.317
- We'll flush her abdomen.
- Yeah.

37:39.417 --> 37:44.658
Her blood work looks really great.
She's gonna be a good anesthetic risk.

37:44.758 --> 37:47.659
- We're catching this early...
- <i>You're gonna get right through this.</i>

37:47.759 --> 37:50.628
Very, very good chance that she'll...
she'll do super fine.

37:50.728 --> 37:54.698
- I'll be able to just make a small...
- Could you give me the percentage of chance?

37:54.798 --> 37:58.803
We're gonna make a small incision...
I would say 95%.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.905
Excellent chance of full recovery.

38:01.005 --> 38:03.539
- That's all I want.
- Okay.

38:44.081 --> 38:46.384
Mornin', Mr. Manglehorn.
You doin' alright today?

38:46.484 --> 38:49.587
- Another day, another sausage.
- You got that right.

38:49.687 --> 38:52.323
Little ol' sausage he got...

38:52.423 --> 38:53.958
I don't know what he doing...

38:54.058 --> 38:55.820
For Chief.

38:57.662 --> 38:59.730
- How's he doing?
- So much better.

38:59.830 --> 39:01.532
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, the wound is healing.

39:01.632 --> 39:04.502
- Yeah? It's healing.
- Yeah.

39:04.602 --> 39:08.272
Thank you so much.
You're such a sweet man.

39:08.372 --> 39:09.874
She's a little drugged.

39:09.974 --> 39:14.343
It's starting to take effect on her.

39:16.566 --> 39:20.599
Alright, Ms. Fannie,
we're fixin' to open you up, young lady.

39:22.086 --> 39:27.158
Pop that scalpel blade
on my sterile 4x4s right there.

39:27.258 --> 39:29.474
Okay, don't touch nothing.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.831
Go ahead and get that t... tape.
Be careful now.

39:33.931 --> 39:37.535
Y'all scrubbed her already?
Alright, put that solution on there.

39:37.635 --> 39:40.838
That's what needs to be on there
right now. Yeah, just drape it on there.

39:40.938 --> 39:44.208
Sorry to say, I'm gonna have
to withdraw some cash.

39:44.308 --> 39:48.413
'Cause I went for that
second opinion and...

39:48.513 --> 39:50.982
you know, Fannie got some X-rays.

39:51.082 --> 39:53.050
Okay, we're gonna open her up...

39:53.150 --> 39:55.486
And now, they put me
on the Total Care Plan.

39:55.586 --> 39:56.541
What's that?

39:56.641 --> 39:59.390
She had to have some involved surgery

39:59.490 --> 40:02.927
and so... we gotta pay by the month.

40:03.340 --> 40:05.763
Yeah. Not too happy about it.

40:05.863 --> 40:10.768
Based on our radiographs
we got a foreign object

40:10.868 --> 40:14.505
that looks like... a key of some sort

40:14.605 --> 40:15.873
located in the intestine.

40:15.973 --> 40:19.610
We've got a lot of intestinal
fat here in the omentum.

40:19.710 --> 40:21.512
- I'm so sorry.
- So...

40:21.612 --> 40:26.284
Look at you, coming in here
with a toy for my dog.

40:26.384 --> 40:29.954
It's a cheap toy.
Picked it up in a bargain bin.

40:30.054 --> 40:32.290
- Well, it's the thought.
- The thought. Yeah.

40:32.390 --> 40:35.660
We're gonna take a look here.
Very nice viable tissue.

40:35.760 --> 40:39.764
Very pink and pretty with all the mesenteric
vessels in good shape.

40:39.864 --> 40:43.100
And... there we go.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.232
That doesn't belong there.

40:46.332 --> 40:47.946
It appears...

40:48.046 --> 40:51.709
with our little animal friends that they're
a lot tougher than us humans.

40:51.809 --> 40:54.779
A lot of them,
after a major abdominal surgery

40:54.879 --> 40:58.714
seem to be fairly oblivious
to real pain.

40:59.382 --> 41:01.085
And...

41:01.185 --> 41:05.389
this is what Ms. Fannie has gotten into.

41:05.489 --> 41:09.413
So, you know, I got...
no Fannie for about a week.

41:09.513 --> 41:11.963
Are you just sittin' around on weekend?
You need some company?

41:12.063 --> 41:13.918
I'm going to a pancake jamboree.

41:14.018 --> 41:17.035
You know, at the Legion,
I'm going there tomorrow.

41:17.435 --> 41:18.756
See the old guys.

41:18.856 --> 41:20.972
I like hangin' out with folks
worse off than me.

41:21.072 --> 41:23.250
Makes me look at the bright side.

41:23.508 --> 41:28.713
- I also like pancakes.
- I've never been to that. Always meant to.

41:28.813 --> 41:31.447
Well, you should come on down.
I think you'll enjoy it.

41:31.748 --> 41:33.759
Maybe I will.

41:34.251 --> 41:36.821
Numbers are still good, 96 over 168.

41:36.921 --> 41:42.480
As we close her up here, what we'll do
is put absorbable sutures in the midline.

41:42.580 --> 41:45.216
She had no appearance
of any intussusception

41:45.316 --> 41:48.669
which is where the intestinal tube

41:49.019 --> 41:52.423
envelopes down on itself just like...

41:52.523 --> 41:54.091
when you pull your sock off at night

41:54.191 --> 41:57.128
and it's half off
and still half on your foot.

41:57.428 --> 41:59.645
The tube of the sock...

42:01.731 --> 42:04.769
- Give little Fannie a squeeze for me.
- Oh, sure.

42:04.869 --> 42:08.771
- Don't worry too much, okay?
- Yeah.

42:08.871 --> 42:12.053
<i>I was sinking</i>

42:12.153 --> 42:14.672
<i>Deep in sin</i>

42:15.090 --> 42:19.722
<i>Far from the peaceful shore</i>

42:19.822 --> 42:25.036
<i>Very deeply stained within</i>

42:25.136 --> 42:30.533
<i>I was sinking to rise no more</i>

42:31.136 --> 42:35.666
<i>But the master of the sea</i>

42:36.066 --> 42:39.346
<i>He heard my despairing cry</i>

42:40.621 --> 42:45.036
<i>From the waters he lifted me</i>

42:45.136 --> 42:49.686
<i>Now so safe am I</i>

42:49.786 --> 42:54.664
<i>And it was love</i>

42:54.764 --> 42:58.092
<i>Lifted me</i>

42:59.142 --> 43:04.001
<i>Love lifted me</i>

43:04.101 --> 43:05.948
<i>You sad girl</i>

43:06.048 --> 43:09.074
<i>It was love</i>

43:09.174 --> 43:12.076
<i>Lifted me</i>

43:12.176 --> 43:17.183
<i>I said when nothing else could help</i>

43:17.283 --> 43:21.459
<i>Oh, when nothing else could help</i>

43:21.559 --> 43:24.672
<i>I said it was love</i>

43:24.772 --> 43:27.879
<i>Lifted</i>

43:27.979 --> 43:30.736
<i>Me</i>

43:34.524 --> 43:36.492
Not bad?

43:37.093 --> 43:38.863
Very good.

43:38.963 --> 43:40.997
See you soon.

43:55.311 --> 43:57.214
Someone said, I thought it was you.

43:57.314 --> 44:00.718
I never said a word about bananas.
Now did you hear me say something?

44:00.818 --> 44:03.821
Nobody gets it, except him.
He eats a banana in two bites.

44:03.921 --> 44:07.765
How many people do you know who eats
a banana in two bites? And he did.

44:07.865 --> 44:10.928
In two bites?
And his name was Harry Belafonte?

44:11.028 --> 44:13.964
Not those little Mexican turds,
you know.

44:14.064 --> 44:17.435
- The big Hawaiian chalambos.
- I bet you I can do it.

44:17.535 --> 44:21.272
We'll get a banana later. Let me have this
first, I just don't wanna fill myself...

44:21.372 --> 44:23.974
Why the guy didn't go
to the carnival with that?

44:24.274 --> 44:28.112
I remember last time... You know, I was 8
years old when I went to my first carnival?

44:28.212 --> 44:31.916
And it was amazing, there were lights,
smell of cotton candy in the air.

44:32.016 --> 44:34.899
That time I could smell,
I had a sense of smell, I lost it.

44:34.999 --> 44:38.022
Oh, my sense of smell is not
very good either. I've noticed.

44:38.122 --> 44:39.890
Anyway, I was really into it.

44:39.990 --> 44:43.460
I took my little sister and we
went over to this ride called...

44:43.560 --> 44:46.997
Ride A Boat Across The Pond.
And there were these kids in front of us.

44:47.097 --> 44:50.501
It was pretty sad 'cause they were
all sick, I think. They had bandages.

44:50.601 --> 44:55.506
They had a nun with them.
Meanest, ugliest face you ever saw.

44:55.606 --> 44:59.743
I mean, it was really mean.
I remember being scared.

44:59.843 --> 45:05.783
Now they all get in this boat and they
strap themselves across with the big bar.

45:05.883 --> 45:11.188
And they just take off.
All of a sudden, boat starts to tip.

45:11.288 --> 45:15.526
It's real quiet and we watch
this thing just tip.

45:16.126 --> 45:18.694
And then, bam!

45:19.929 --> 45:21.165
Tips over.

45:21.365 --> 45:23.467
I never saw anything like it.
We just froze.

45:23.567 --> 45:26.036
Few seconds go by and this nun,

45:26.136 --> 45:30.656
she comes up under the boat
and she's screamin'.

45:30.756 --> 45:33.711
No children with her.
Just screaming, "Help, help."

45:33.811 --> 45:37.663
So few of the guys on the line did jump in
the water start swimming toward the boat.

45:37.763 --> 45:41.218
They can't do anything.
No children, just the nun.

45:41.318 --> 45:44.655
And so they start swimmin'
under the boat

45:44.755 --> 45:49.226
seein' if they could get to the... to the
little kids and just pull 'em out, you know.

45:49.326 --> 45:50.961
And this just goes on and on and on.

45:51.061 --> 45:55.104
It was like endless and they
just keep doin' it over and over again.

45:55.204 --> 45:57.168
Finally this guy gives up.

45:57.268 --> 45:59.793
He looks over at us, says,

46:00.335 --> 46:02.156
"They're dead."

46:03.239 --> 46:04.942
- What happened to the nun?
- All of them?

46:05.042 --> 46:07.710
Yeah. All the children were dead.

46:10.413 --> 46:12.214
I don't know.

46:13.650 --> 46:15.386
Sounds like an act of God to me.

46:15.486 --> 46:18.889
Yeah, well, how you ever
gonna tell me there's a God?

46:18.989 --> 46:23.060
How anybody gonna tell me
there's a God after that?

46:23.160 --> 46:24.927
No way.

46:25.962 --> 46:28.299
I'm just a hungry bear.

46:28.399 --> 46:31.869
Yeah, a few more.
Say, you could... you could...

46:31.969 --> 46:34.313
Don't be stingy on the bacon.

46:44.547 --> 46:47.983
How are you doing... Dawn?

46:48.651 --> 46:51.487
Hey, how you doin' there, Dawn?

46:53.122 --> 46:57.726
Sorry. Nice to see ya. You made it out?

46:59.762 --> 47:01.597
Good seeing you.

47:02.231 --> 47:04.719
- Come on, grab yourself... some food.
- Yeah, I thought...

47:04.819 --> 47:08.239
- I'm gonna grab us a table.
- I thought I'd check it out.

47:09.139 --> 47:12.643
My mother and brother and I,
we moved to Sacramento.

47:12.743 --> 47:14.545
Have you ever been there?

47:14.645 --> 47:15.913
Sacramento?

47:16.013 --> 47:18.382
- No. Never have.
- It's real beautiful.

47:18.482 --> 47:20.684
- Yeah.
- Big trees.

47:20.784 --> 47:22.987
What d... what did your brother do?

47:23.087 --> 47:27.723
Don't laugh, but for a while
he was a professional mime.

47:29.560 --> 47:33.797
I don't know what's so funny about it.
You said don't laugh, but it's funny.

47:33.897 --> 47:35.585
You're right.

47:35.685 --> 47:40.337
I just saw a mime. You believe it?
Couple of days ago, in the park.

47:40.437 --> 47:43.226
- I mean, they used to be everywhere, right?
- I know. What happened?

47:43.326 --> 47:46.458
- Lost art, I suppose.
- Yeah.

47:46.558 --> 47:51.772
- You've been here your whole life?
- No. I come from north of here.

47:51.872 --> 47:55.786
Yeah. I moved... I moved here
about 40 years ago. Close to it.

47:55.886 --> 47:59.156
I liked it. I thought maybe
it'd be a good place to raise kids.

47:59.256 --> 48:02.059
You know, I got a son...

48:02.159 --> 48:04.480
and a granddaughter.

48:04.728 --> 48:09.271
- You ever think about retiring?
- Retiring? No, that'd be terrible.

48:09.700 --> 48:12.028
I wouldn't know what to do.

48:12.336 --> 48:17.105
And you know what they say
"Idle hands is the devil's playthings."

48:17.205 --> 48:20.678
I would probably get into a lot
of trouble like the man over there.

48:20.778 --> 48:23.324
He's a time bomb. Yeah.

48:23.424 --> 48:26.583
Hey, Ned. He's sweet though.

48:26.683 --> 48:29.019
Nah. You know what I'd like.

48:29.119 --> 48:33.255
I'd like to get in my boat.
I got a boat. With Fannie.

48:33.755 --> 48:37.693
Get on the ocean and just disappear.

48:38.194 --> 48:40.030
You know,

48:40.130 --> 48:42.004
float away.

48:42.398 --> 48:46.370
What would I do without my friend around?
You know, I'd be sad on Fridays.

48:46.470 --> 48:48.425
Oh, yeah.

48:49.239 --> 48:51.706
Well, that's... that's...

48:52.006 --> 48:54.035
that's nice to hear.

48:54.135 --> 48:56.881
Would you? Yeah?

48:57.481 --> 49:00.350
Well, it's good to know that.
I'm enjoyin' this, you know.

49:00.450 --> 49:01.846
Sitting around with you here.

49:02.146 --> 49:05.270
You got my mind off a lot of stuff.

49:05.370 --> 49:09.827
Crowds' thinned down. There used to be
a lot more people comin' to these things.

49:09.927 --> 49:12.494
Same amount of pancakes though.

49:19.802 --> 49:21.844
Let's do it again?

49:22.839 --> 49:24.540
Okay.

49:33.749 --> 49:36.078
<i>If I could go back...</i>

49:37.653 --> 49:41.514
<i>if I could go back,
I would change things.</i>

49:42.492 --> 49:47.996
<i>Every night I go to bed, I would wake up
hoping things were like they used to be...</i>

49:49.565 --> 49:50.941
<i>like...</i>

49:51.294 --> 49:53.746
<i>we'll be young again.</i>

49:55.738 --> 49:58.976
<i>I don't have time
to put up with it anymore.</i>

49:59.576 --> 50:04.448
<i>The world's changed so much
and I've been around for so many years.</i>

50:04.548 --> 50:06.800
<i>Without you around,</i>

50:07.583 --> 50:09.885
<i>there's no point.</i>

50:15.258 --> 50:17.796
<i>I got nothing, but frustration...</i>

50:18.761 --> 50:20.696
<i>disappointment.</i>

50:41.951 --> 50:44.311
<i>I need you, Clara.</i>

50:45.855 --> 50:50.725
<i>I need you. I need you more than anything
in the world right now.</i>

51:01.737 --> 51:04.984
<i>I look for happiness.</i>

51:06.475 --> 51:10.278
<i>Without you, that don't exist.</i>

51:13.182 --> 51:14.852
<i>You know...</i>

51:14.952 --> 51:17.062
<i>loving you...</i>

51:17.587 --> 51:20.656
<i>is the only thing I ever done right.</i>

51:24.060 --> 51:26.465
<i>No one compares.</i>

51:26.565 --> 51:28.687
<i>They never will.</i>

51:41.712 --> 51:43.458
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

51:43.558 --> 51:46.315
- I'm good.
- Come in, come in.

51:48.217 --> 51:51.155
I want you to... I want you
to see my place.

51:51.255 --> 51:56.213
Yeah, well, that must be
the world famous... Chief! Right?

51:56.313 --> 51:59.363
- Yes.
- Hey, Chief! Let me see you.

51:59.463 --> 52:03.100
- Be good.
- That poor baby. Come to papa.

52:03.500 --> 52:06.568
You've... come here,
come here, come here.

52:06.902 --> 52:10.574
Hey, Chief, say hello to me.
I heard so much about you.

52:10.674 --> 52:15.012
Yes. The poor baby's
gotta have this stuff.

52:15.112 --> 52:17.214
How long does he have to have it on for?

52:17.314 --> 52:19.082
Oh, just for a couple of more days.

52:19.182 --> 52:20.951
- Just a couple of more days.
- Yeah.

52:21.051 --> 52:25.322
Hey, my boy. Here, come on.
He's something, isn't he?

52:25.422 --> 52:27.256
Gee, sorry.

52:27.357 --> 52:29.693
Oh, my God.

52:30.520 --> 52:32.296
Well, I'm sorry.

52:32.396 --> 52:33.931
- Now, don't be.
- I do it every time.

52:34.031 --> 52:36.566
That happens all the time.
I put that in the wrong place.

52:36.666 --> 52:40.037
- But the dirt came out now.
- You have a seat. Let me get it.

52:40.137 --> 52:43.073
- You got a vacuum cleaner in here?
- No. Absolutely not.

52:43.173 --> 52:45.108
- I've got to clean that up.
- I'll get that.

52:45.208 --> 52:47.778
Thank you very much.

52:48.578 --> 52:53.016
Well, it is a nice place
you got here, I must say, it is...

52:53.116 --> 52:56.086
you know, you got
all the knick knacks here.

52:56.186 --> 53:01.058
Look at this. You got a fancy
clay collection and everything.

53:01.158 --> 53:05.662
What'd you do? Boost these things
from Queen of England or something?

53:05.762 --> 53:08.065
Yeah. Look at this.

53:08.165 --> 53:12.135
I know this... this has got real value.
I know these things.

53:12.235 --> 53:13.966
I like your shirt.

53:17.540 --> 53:20.177
- Yeah?
- You look good.

53:20.277 --> 53:23.919
You do too. Thank you.

53:24.580 --> 53:26.416
You look...

53:27.883 --> 53:29.853
you look like a race horse or something.

53:31.354 --> 53:32.356
Yeah.

53:32.456 --> 53:34.825
- I look like a race horse.
- Yeah, I said that.

53:34.925 --> 53:36.893
Well, there's worse things...

53:36.993 --> 53:40.063
- Things just come out of my head sometime.
- No.

53:40.163 --> 53:44.601
I always say the wrong thing, but what
I meant to say is you look really good.

53:44.701 --> 53:46.036
- Have a seat.
- I'm okay.

53:46.136 --> 53:49.673
Would you like a glass of wine
or you know, grape juice?

53:49.773 --> 53:52.675
Yeah, well, blood of Christ.

53:54.210 --> 53:55.979
Blood of Christ.

53:58.447 --> 54:00.850
I'm happy you asked me to dinner.

54:05.454 --> 54:08.857
- Where is your bathroom?
- Oh, right there.

54:08.957 --> 54:10.827
Thank you.

55:03.379 --> 55:05.348
Two seniors.

55:06.682 --> 55:09.128
20 dollars 93 cents.

55:09.885 --> 55:13.389
It went up? When did it go up?

55:15.090 --> 55:17.593
You people gotta eat too, I guess.

55:22.698 --> 55:27.704
It went up. 4 more dollars
than it normally is.

55:27.804 --> 55:29.706
You believe that?

55:33.375 --> 55:35.344
How's the fish?

55:37.980 --> 55:40.383
Shall we go get a drink after this?

55:40.883 --> 55:43.153
Maybe see a movie.

55:43.887 --> 55:47.412
Well, you know, I think I better
get back to...

55:47.512 --> 55:49.253
to Fannie and...

55:49.353 --> 55:51.761
I... I thought she was
on recovery at the vet.

55:51.861 --> 55:54.798
Yeah, she is, but you know...

55:54.898 --> 55:59.469
she's... kinda lonely and then I've just...
I don't wanna leave her there alone.

55:59.569 --> 56:03.172
They've got the 24-hour visitation,
so I could go any time.

56:07.026 --> 56:08.434
You're a good man.

56:13.849 --> 56:17.104
I really had such a nice time
with you the other day.

56:17.653 --> 56:19.856
I like being around you.

56:19.956 --> 56:23.660
Yeah. I'm... I'm just a person,
you know?

56:23.760 --> 56:27.664
Well, I'm a people person,
so you're in luck.

56:27.764 --> 56:30.400
Yeah. People.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.603
- Who needs 'em, right?
- You don't mean that.

56:33.703 --> 56:36.439
Yeah. Well, you know, most of them.

56:36.539 --> 56:40.844
Don't be a grump. People are important.

56:40.944 --> 56:44.681
With... with... with people
you... you have substance...

56:44.781 --> 56:49.518
and life's better
when there's human substance.

56:51.220 --> 56:53.155
I love life.

56:53.255 --> 56:55.624
Like I'm a baby.

56:55.724 --> 56:57.526
I just...

56:58.327 --> 57:00.530
wake up excited everyday that I'm alive.

57:00.630 --> 57:03.499
I... I love everything.

57:03.599 --> 57:05.935
I really do.

57:07.970 --> 57:10.152
You know what I love?

57:10.540 --> 57:13.877
I love... taking baths.

57:13.977 --> 57:17.580
And watching the water
come out of the faucet.

57:19.214 --> 57:21.251
I just sit there.

57:21.351 --> 57:25.622
- Yeah.
- And think... isn't that amazing?

57:25.922 --> 57:30.860
All this beautiful clean water coming
right out of the faucet stickin' on my wall.

57:32.227 --> 57:34.730
Simple things, you know?

57:35.197 --> 57:37.300
Big things.

57:42.671 --> 57:45.057
Let's take a bath together.

57:46.642 --> 57:49.145
Would you like to take a bath with me?

57:54.149 --> 57:58.455
You know, you're wearing
this very similar dress...

57:58.555 --> 58:00.991
that Clara used to wear.

58:01.491 --> 58:04.294
- Who's Clara?
- Clara.

58:04.394 --> 58:07.263
She was a very special woman in my life.

58:07.852 --> 58:10.257
Is this your ex-wife?

58:10.357 --> 58:12.769
No, I was never married to her.

58:12.869 --> 58:15.627
I was married, but not to Clara.

58:15.727 --> 58:18.541
Yeah. The other day, at the bank...

58:18.641 --> 58:23.112
Yeah. We used to do this. Me and Clara.
Go out, have dinner...

58:23.212 --> 58:27.050
talk stuff... eat.

58:27.150 --> 58:30.453
She was... she was really great company.

58:31.620 --> 58:35.058
She had a certain way
about her, you know.

58:35.158 --> 58:38.562
She was perfect in a manner of speaking.

58:39.162 --> 58:42.766
I mean, she was
this giant ball of fire...

58:42.866 --> 58:45.568
giant spirit.

58:45.668 --> 58:49.138
I was very small by comparison.

58:50.539 --> 58:52.976
And she was always so interesting.

58:53.076 --> 58:56.046
I mean, she always had
interesting things to say

58:56.146 --> 58:59.149
and whatever you want to know
she... she was right there.

58:59.249 --> 59:02.319
I mean, you wanted to know
somethin' about Vesalius.

59:02.419 --> 59:07.190
Or let's say you wanted to know
something about Leeuwenhoek

59:07.290 --> 59:12.162
or Isaac Newton or whatever.
Tina Turner.

59:12.762 --> 59:18.168
She was an observer, a great observer
historian, life and people.

59:18.268 --> 59:20.470
Time just flew when I was with her.

59:20.570 --> 59:23.840
I mean, we were in a restaurant
in Florence, Italy.

59:23.940 --> 59:27.243
Looking out, there were these
children playing in the street

59:27.343 --> 59:31.042
and she's ordering off...
off the menu for me

59:31.142 --> 59:36.219
and we're talking and we're talkin'
in Italian, broken Italian and...

59:36.319 --> 59:40.557
then it's an hour, maybe two hours
gone by, it felt like seconds.

59:40.657 --> 59:43.095
I turn around, everybody's gone.

59:43.660 --> 59:46.137
Chairs on top of the tables

59:46.237 --> 59:49.855
and there's just Clara sittin' there.

59:50.599 --> 59:55.167
Thunder crashin'
and rain fallin' and she's...

59:55.267 --> 59:59.810
kinda burnin' against that...
that tableau...

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:02.278
talkin' to me...

01:00:03.879 --> 01:00:06.582
having dinner with me.

01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:14.023
I'm sorry I'm not as interesting
as she seems to be to you.

01:00:14.123 --> 01:00:16.129
Oh, nobody is.

01:00:16.229 --> 01:00:18.611
I mean, not just you. It's just...

01:00:18.761 --> 01:00:21.398
They broke the mold when they made her.

01:00:21.498 --> 01:00:24.701
- It's just one of those things, you know.
- Sounds like quite a woman.

01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:28.371
Oh, yeah. You...
you don't even know, I mean...

01:00:28.471 --> 01:00:32.309
she has so much emotion,
she was emotional...

01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:35.923
I mean, she tried to hide it, but...

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:38.014
I knew.

01:00:40.782 --> 01:00:43.353
Can we talk about something else?

01:00:43.453 --> 01:00:46.488
Yeah. What you got?

01:00:50.092 --> 01:00:52.860
Hey, you know you got nice eyes.

01:00:53.229 --> 01:00:54.664
For the record.

01:00:54.964 --> 01:00:57.366
I kinda like your eyes.

01:00:59.801 --> 01:01:02.789
You know when I eat macaroni salad...

01:01:03.206 --> 01:01:05.877
I get bloated.

01:01:06.642 --> 01:01:09.712
I mean, I eat beets...

01:01:09.812 --> 01:01:12.314
I have instant diarrhea.

01:01:15.617 --> 01:01:17.853
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:01:18.993 --> 01:01:23.059
I thought this was gonna be
something different... you know.

01:01:25.027 --> 01:01:26.763
How do you mean?

01:01:27.063 --> 01:01:29.164
I like you.

01:01:30.165 --> 01:01:32.581
You know, I couldn't sleep last night.

01:01:34.202 --> 01:01:37.609
I was so excited for this date.

01:01:38.141 --> 01:01:41.077
Just excited, you know, to see you.

01:01:41.177 --> 01:01:43.112
And now, I feel like
you'd rather I just leave.

01:01:43.212 --> 01:01:45.581
Oh, no. I'm... I'm not sayin' that.

01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:50.353
You know, I thought you were
a nice man but I... you bring me here...

01:01:50.953 --> 01:01:54.691
and I open up to you and you talk
about a woman you're still in love with.

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:58.629
- How is that supposed to make me feel?
- I don't know.

01:01:59.529 --> 01:02:02.565
I'm not asking for the world. I'm not.

01:02:02.665 --> 01:02:06.936
- I know.
- We've all had relationships in this life.

01:02:07.036 --> 01:02:08.338
You don't wanna cry, Dawn.

01:02:08.438 --> 01:02:12.442
And some things we feel and regret
deeply and hold on to.

01:02:12.542 --> 01:02:14.878
But that's not what I came here for.

01:02:14.978 --> 01:02:17.347
I know. There's people
sittin' here, you know.

01:02:17.447 --> 01:02:20.249
I came here because...

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:28.006
I was hopin' you liked me
like I like you.

01:02:28.106 --> 01:02:30.493
Oh, please. Please, don't.

01:02:30.593 --> 01:02:31.962
There's people.

01:02:32.262 --> 01:02:33.830
I'm gonna go.

01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.299
No, no, you don't wanna go.
Don't... wait I'll just...

01:02:36.399 --> 01:02:39.602
You have no idea how humiliated I am.

01:02:39.702 --> 01:02:43.039
I'll take you home. Where you going?

01:03:00.088 --> 01:03:02.157
What's this?

01:03:08.196 --> 01:03:09.732
<i>Allied Discount Tires.</i>

01:03:09.832 --> 01:03:12.302
<i>You know we sell you tires 5% cheaper</i>

01:03:12.402 --> 01:03:14.737
<i>than any of the other
tire stores' lowest prices.</i>

01:03:14.837 --> 01:03:18.434
<i>You drive into Allied Discount Tires store
they drive your car on the rack.</i>

01:03:18.534 --> 01:03:19.909
<i>They gonna give you great service.</i>

01:03:20.009 --> 01:03:22.395
<i>They raise your car up,
and that guy gets in the pit.</i>

01:03:22.495 --> 01:03:26.449
<i>He looks up under your car, he tells you
what you need and what you don't need.</i>

01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:29.752
<i>He don't give you no pit-bull.
You know, tires are tough to advertise.</i>

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:32.791
<i>It's easy to advertise somethin' good
to eat, somethin' that smells good,</i>

01:03:32.891 --> 01:03:35.425
<i>somethin' that makes you look good
so like I say, tires ain't pretty,</i>

01:03:35.525 --> 01:03:38.667
<i>but you know,
it's very hard to advertise...</i>

01:03:55.177 --> 01:03:58.081
<i>Yeah, just...</i>

01:03:58.181 --> 01:04:00.916
<i>coming for massage, that's all.</i>

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.688
<i>You know, feeling tense, very tense...</i>

01:04:05.788 --> 01:04:09.125
<i>and anxious and I'm tired.</i>

01:04:09.225 --> 01:04:11.386
<i>But I'm very stiff.</i>

01:04:12.562 --> 01:04:15.413
<i>I need a day on the beach.</i>

01:04:15.864 --> 01:04:20.372
<i>And I need to get back to...</i>

01:04:21.887 --> 01:04:23.877
<i>normal.</i>

01:04:24.006 --> 01:04:25.156
<i>Back to normal.</i>

01:04:26.441 --> 01:04:28.945
- Anybody home?
- Coach?

01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:32.482
- Goddamn! Is that you, coach?
- Hey, Gary.

01:04:32.582 --> 01:04:34.417
I am so glad.

01:04:34.517 --> 01:04:36.719
- Don't get too close, buddy.
- Coach, coach, coach.

01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:38.655
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let me just feel.

01:04:38.755 --> 01:04:41.090
- Yeah, those as rocks.
- Hard as rocks, coach?

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:43.126
I promise you, coach,
you're gonna love it.

01:04:43.226 --> 01:04:46.128
- Oh, yeah. Well, let's...
- Come on, coach.

01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:47.997
- Let me give you a little tour here.
- Yeah.

01:04:48.097 --> 01:04:51.467
This hallway right here
was designed by a Vietnamese.

01:04:51.567 --> 01:04:54.404
A Vietnamese man and his wife.

01:04:55.404 --> 01:04:57.440
Girls, we've got somebody
with a stiff neck.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.476
He needs his pores popped.
He needs his pimples jammed.

01:05:00.576 --> 01:05:03.880
This is Coach Mangie, Mangie, Mangie,
basketball... baseball, basketball.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.915
- All sport coach.
- Hi, Mr. Mangie.

01:05:06.015 --> 01:05:09.050
<i>I need to quiet... I need to quiet down.</i>

01:05:09.919 --> 01:05:13.055
<i>My nerves... I know it's funny.</i>

01:05:13.155 --> 01:05:16.693
<i>I get so funny about that.
You know sometimes, we...</i>

01:05:16.793 --> 01:05:19.028
<i>I got some kind of control.</i>

01:05:19.128 --> 01:05:21.731
<i>I got some kind of control, but then...</i>

01:05:21.831 --> 01:05:24.267
The floors are a little greasy,
but it's vitamin B.

01:05:24.367 --> 01:05:26.002
They seethe from the sides.

01:05:26.102 --> 01:05:28.371
<i>I just want a massage.
I want to lie somewhere.</i>

01:05:28.471 --> 01:05:31.574
<i>Have my brain breathe.
Just have it breathe.</i>

01:05:31.674 --> 01:05:34.877
You're gonna enjoy this.
This the audiovisual jambox.

01:05:34.977 --> 01:05:36.879
Wire music, right into you.

01:05:36.979 --> 01:05:40.469
It's pretty advanced.
Basically it's 14 mega jams of slafee.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.503
I was perfecting a different
playlist every day,

01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:45.821
but then we got these Mexican dudes
who'd come in here and swamp the feel.

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:47.790
Hey, coach!

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:50.226
Coach, you're gonna love this.

01:05:50.326 --> 01:05:53.996
Wake up. Come on.
Oh, this beauty right here is Joaquin.

01:05:54.096 --> 01:05:55.464
Thumbs up, Joaquin.

01:05:55.564 --> 01:05:58.524
He's my landlord, pay him off with suntans.
Your time's up, buddy. Get out!

01:05:58.627 --> 01:06:02.405
A rabbit that was dressed
like a clown, I wanted to be that.

01:06:02.505 --> 01:06:06.576
I don't want to be me.
Right now, I don't want to be anything.

01:06:06.676 --> 01:06:09.178
I don't want to be a picture
and I don't want to be me.

01:06:09.278 --> 01:06:12.915
- I just want a massage.
- Dear friend of mine.

01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:14.760
Coach...

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.038
loosen up.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:16.986
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:17.086 --> 01:06:20.648
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I just...

01:06:21.257 --> 01:06:22.993
I was...

01:06:24.926 --> 01:06:27.396
- Coming in for a massage?
- I was just coming in for a massage and...

01:06:27.496 --> 01:06:30.166
- Perfect.
- I know Gary and he...

01:06:30.266 --> 01:06:32.924
Yeah, he told me all about you.

01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:37.740
- Yeah?
- He told me to take real good care of you.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:44.146
Okay. I had a pretty stressful night.
You know, I just... socially.

01:06:44.246 --> 01:06:46.949
And I... and I...
and I got very tense...

01:06:47.049 --> 01:06:50.154
- Okay.
- I developed a sorta...

01:06:50.254 --> 01:06:53.404
kinda tightness in... my shoulder.

01:06:53.504 --> 01:06:58.093
You wanna get a little bit comfy, maybe?
So I can see those knots a little bit better?

01:06:58.526 --> 01:07:01.037
Come on. It will be fun.

01:07:01.397 --> 01:07:03.899
I'm... I'm sorry but I don't...
Wha... what is that?

01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:07.570
It's some services we offer.
I can just show you if you'd like.

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:11.908
- You're gonna do the massage?
- Of course. And then you can do me.

01:07:12.608 --> 01:07:15.378
What do you think? Have some fun.

01:07:15.478 --> 01:07:19.328
- What's on it? What's on this?
- Anything you want.

01:07:19.428 --> 01:07:21.549
Some sensual stimulation?

01:07:21.684 --> 01:07:26.722
There's a gentlemen's massage, but I think
you'd probably want something little bit.

01:07:26.822 --> 01:07:29.225
- I have to... I'm sorry.
- Where are you going?

01:07:35.297 --> 01:07:37.333
Coach! Coach!

01:07:37.433 --> 01:07:39.569
Manglehorn! Coach!

01:07:39.669 --> 01:07:42.038
Come on, coach! Manglehorn. Come on!

01:07:42.138 --> 01:07:45.374
- Coach. Coach. Manglehorn.
- Stay away from me, Gary.

01:07:45.474 --> 01:07:49.112
Who do you think I am? You to put me
in a room with a lady like that?

01:07:49.512 --> 01:07:51.981
- Coach!
- What do you think I am?

01:07:52.081 --> 01:07:55.418
- Damn.
- You don't know who I am!

01:07:55.518 --> 01:07:57.719
Oh, coach.

01:07:58.053 --> 01:07:59.722
Manglehorn!

01:07:59.822 --> 01:08:02.158
Goddamn it. I just want
to make you happy, coach.

01:08:02.258 --> 01:08:05.061
Come on. Come on. Coach.

01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:09.365
- Coach, why did you break my lamp?
- I broke your lamp? You don't know why?

01:08:09.465 --> 01:08:12.869
- You don't know why I broke your lamp?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, coach.

01:08:12.969 --> 01:08:14.937
- I'm sorry. I'm...
- That's making fun of me.

01:08:15.037 --> 01:08:16.805
- I wasn't making fun...
- Why did you send me in there?

01:08:16.904 --> 01:08:19.941
- I was just trying to...
- Why did you send me in there?

01:08:20.443 --> 01:08:22.639
You don't know better?

01:08:23.045 --> 01:08:27.774
- Why? Why? Why did you do that?
- I'm sorry, coach! Sorry, coach.

01:08:27.874 --> 01:08:32.220
You look fine. Get up now
and get away from the car.

01:08:33.388 --> 01:08:36.426
- I thought you want a massage, coach.
- Yeah. Listen...

01:08:36.926 --> 01:08:40.228
right now, I hate you.

01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:46.134
I'm pulling out!

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.943
Why do you hate everyone?

01:08:55.777 --> 01:08:58.412
Why do you hate everyone, coach?

01:09:04.219 --> 01:09:07.622
Listen, girl, coach is a good man.

01:09:07.723 --> 01:09:09.725
He didn't mean none of that.

01:09:09.825 --> 01:09:12.394
He's a man of miracles.

01:09:12.961 --> 01:09:14.897
<i>I remember once we were playing.</i>

01:09:14.997 --> 01:09:18.667
<i>Coach was like... we wanted
to call the game for rain.</i>

01:09:18.768 --> 01:09:21.770
<i>He was like, "Keep playing,
keep playing, keep playing."</i>

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:25.441
<i>Thunder and lightning bolts
came down and...</i>

01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:28.978
there was this little dog
off to the side by the dugout.

01:09:29.078 --> 01:09:33.149
And I remember a little bolt of lightning
just hit him, just lit him up.

01:09:33.249 --> 01:09:36.652
<i>All his fur just went up
and the dog fell...</i>

01:09:36.752 --> 01:09:40.288
<i>fell to the side and coach
just bent down on his knees</i>

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.892
<i>just put his hand out,
and just patted out the fur.</i>

01:09:42.992 --> 01:09:45.461
The fire goes right out and he takes
his hand up and there's a flame

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.663
shootin' up from his palm, and he just
looks me in the eyes and goes...

01:09:48.764 --> 01:09:52.108
"Happy birthday." Just like that.

01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:55.671
<i>He's a special man.</i>

01:09:57.205 --> 01:10:00.542
Stuff like that never
leaves you, you know.

01:10:00.642 --> 01:10:02.111
Yeah.

01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:04.780
Things like that, don't come every day.

01:10:29.371 --> 01:10:31.156
You don't look so good, kiddo.

01:10:32.041 --> 01:10:34.232
No, I'm okay.

01:10:40.515 --> 01:10:43.117
I'm in... I'm in a bit of trouble, Dad.

01:10:43.218 --> 01:10:47.556
- What happened? Kylie okay?
- Yeah, Kylie is fine.

01:10:48.022 --> 01:10:49.793
You got anything to drink?

01:10:51.392 --> 01:10:53.881
Your house smells like trash, Dad.

01:10:55.029 --> 01:10:57.571
Well, that's nice to hear.

01:10:59.367 --> 01:11:02.204
Okay. What's going on?

01:11:05.107 --> 01:11:07.308
I'm being investigated.

01:11:07.609 --> 01:11:09.470
Investigated?

01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:13.715
- What did you do? Something illegal?
- No.

01:11:13.816 --> 01:11:17.019
The people that invest with me,
they know there's a risk.

01:11:17.119 --> 01:11:20.489
I took what was fair. I do all the work.
They don't do anything.

01:11:20.589 --> 01:11:23.925
Don't spit shine yourself to me.
I know what's going on.

01:11:24.025 --> 01:11:26.827
You don't know
what's going on, Dad, okay?

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:30.733
Okay.

01:11:32.567 --> 01:11:36.072
So where did I go wrong with you, Jacob?

01:11:36.972 --> 01:11:39.021
From the beginning.

01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:41.177
Oh, shut up!

01:11:41.277 --> 01:11:44.080
You wanna make me a villain, go ahead.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:48.250
But I was there, you know it.
I was taking you to school.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:53.022
Back and forth, every day.
Doing your homework at night for you.

01:11:53.888 --> 01:11:55.380
Coaching you at baseball.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.762
You forget 'cause it's convenient
to forget those things. I know.

01:12:00.262 --> 01:12:04.100
It was tough. I thought having a baby
was gonna make Beatrice happy.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.704
It didn't. It didn't work out.
It made things worse and it was tough.

01:12:08.804 --> 01:12:10.940
But people got it a lot tougher.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.509
- And you did alright. Didn't you?
- Yeah.

01:12:13.609 --> 01:12:15.994
You followed your own...

01:12:16.345 --> 01:12:19.515
Walked down that road
even when I said don't do it.

01:12:19.615 --> 01:12:21.817
Yeah, that's right,
I'll drink to it too.

01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:23.933
- I'll drink any day of the week to it.
- Yeah.

01:12:24.033 --> 01:12:26.188
'Cause I was right.

01:12:26.288 --> 01:12:28.560
- I didn't approve and I was right.
- Okay.

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:31.894
Now, what happened?
You got everything you wanted? Yeah?

01:12:31.994 --> 01:12:35.231
Your nice houses, you got your nice...

01:12:35.331 --> 01:12:38.467
fancy cars, all those fancy people.

01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:39.935
And what happened to you?

01:12:40.035 --> 01:12:43.873
It turned you into a shark. And a liar.

01:12:43.973 --> 01:12:46.175
That's what it did for you.

01:12:46.275 --> 01:12:49.512
I'm just telling you like it is.

01:12:49.911 --> 01:12:52.782
You know, I'm no saint, believe me.

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:57.141
I'm just being honest with my son.

01:12:59.921 --> 01:13:04.160
- I'm asking for help, Dad.
- Help? What kind of help?

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:08.180
I got a... I got a pull-out sofa
in the house. You want that?

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.467
- You want to stay here?
- I don't want your sofa.

01:13:11.567 --> 01:13:16.539
You know what I want? It would be great
if you could... could be a father.

01:13:18.974 --> 01:13:21.277
- What is that?
- How about that?

01:13:21.377 --> 01:13:25.014
It could be "Okay, Jacob." It could be
"Good, Jacob. It's gonna be okay."

01:13:25.114 --> 01:13:27.049
- "You're gonna be okay."
- Okay. Is that what being a dad is?

01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:29.919
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's okay? Okay. It's okay.

01:13:30.319 --> 01:13:32.191
It's okay.

01:13:32.988 --> 01:13:36.658
You know, I don't know you.
You pop in, you pop out.

01:13:36.758 --> 01:13:39.194
I mean, every time when I see you

01:13:39.294 --> 01:13:42.765
it's like... it's like...
it's like changing channels.

01:13:43.231 --> 01:13:45.735
Most of the time it's... it's static.

01:13:47.002 --> 01:13:49.471
Everything is off!

01:13:49.571 --> 01:13:52.741
Like a horse opera or something.
I don't even know what you're saying.

01:13:52.841 --> 01:13:55.778
You talk in a language I don't know.

01:13:58.313 --> 01:14:00.749
My assets are frozen.

01:14:01.516 --> 01:14:04.220
They... need... need some money.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.055
I don't have money. Come on!

01:14:07.155 --> 01:14:10.993
Money? Why don't you... why don't you
sell that time machine you got out there?

01:14:11.093 --> 01:14:15.064
- Come on, Dad. I'm not asking for much.
- I don't have money.

01:14:15.164 --> 01:14:16.966
Fannie's in the hospital.

01:14:17.066 --> 01:14:20.703
- Who the hell is Fannie?
- Fannie's my kitty cat.

01:14:20.803 --> 01:14:24.573
She swallowed a key,
she's getting operated on.

01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:27.042
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not. Why would I kid you?

01:14:27.142 --> 01:14:30.612
I'm standing here and I'm telling you
I need help and you're talking about a cat?

01:14:30.712 --> 01:14:33.488
- A cat?
- That's right. Operation cost a lot.

01:14:33.588 --> 01:14:35.250
- God, I don't...
- So I don't have anything.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.286
You know what?
Kylie's mom's not talking to me.

01:14:37.386 --> 01:14:39.857
I don't have anyone to go to,
so I go to you. I go to my dad.

01:14:39.957 --> 01:14:43.292
- I'm here. I don't wanna be here.
- I don't have anyone either.

01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:47.830
Who do I have? When you choose
this life, there is no one.

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.999
It's only you.

01:14:51.432 --> 01:14:53.040
Every man for himself.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.370
And let me tell you something.

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:57.940
When you're sitting there
wherever you are in a dark room

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.878
suffering with the pain, guess what?

01:15:02.644 --> 01:15:04.768
There's still no one.

01:15:05.314 --> 01:15:07.517
No one answerin' the phone.

01:15:10.851 --> 01:15:14.089
No one respondin'
to the letters you send.

01:15:15.223 --> 01:15:17.293
You are invisible.

01:15:18.059 --> 01:15:20.062
We're invisible.

01:15:54.545 --> 01:15:58.000
Did I ever tell you this story about me
and my father we had that fight...

01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.635
before school?

01:15:59.735 --> 01:16:02.694
It's stupid. I came downstairs and...

01:16:02.794 --> 01:16:07.142
he's sitting there in the dark
and he's tinkering with this metal box.

01:16:07.242 --> 01:16:09.411
<i>There's no coffee made.</i>

01:16:09.511 --> 01:16:12.848
So I make a comment and he...
and he flips out.

01:16:12.948 --> 01:16:15.184
And he starts screaming at me,
screaming his head off

01:16:15.284 --> 01:16:18.454
<i>and threw a chair through the window.
He broke the television.</i>

01:16:18.554 --> 01:16:21.257
I mean, he's swinging
at everything. He didn't...

01:16:21.923 --> 01:16:24.727
He didn't swing at me and...

01:16:25.026 --> 01:16:26.762
<i>Anyway, I leave for school.</i>

01:16:26.862 --> 01:16:29.798
<i>He doesn't say goodbye. He doesn't say
goodbye even when he's not angry.</i>

01:16:29.898 --> 01:16:32.468
<i>But I'm walking down the street,
and I hear him in the house.</i>

01:16:32.568 --> 01:16:35.337
He's screaming, "Hello."

01:16:35.437 --> 01:16:38.741
He's screaming at the top
of his lungs, "Hello."

01:16:38.841 --> 01:16:43.178
"Hello." I hear it all the way
down the block. "Hello."

01:16:43.278 --> 01:16:45.748
<i>Anyway I go to school,
I do my day, I get out of school.</i>

01:16:45.848 --> 01:16:47.683
<i>It's like a 180 degrees that day.</i>

01:16:47.783 --> 01:16:50.486
<i>I get home and Mom's there. She's happy.</i>

01:16:50.586 --> 01:16:53.756
I'm thinking did she see the kitchen?
How could she be happy?

01:16:53.856 --> 01:16:56.155
I left and it was a mess.

01:16:56.658 --> 01:16:58.088
And...

01:16:58.188 --> 01:17:01.603
I walk into the kitchen
and there is no trace, man.

01:17:01.703 --> 01:17:04.633
There is no trace of his rage anywhere.

01:17:04.733 --> 01:17:06.068
<i>Everything's fixed.</i>

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:09.304
<i>The window is not broken,
the cabinets are fine.</i>

01:17:09.404 --> 01:17:13.208
<i>He put his hand through the TV, the TV's
working. It's like it never happened.</i>

01:17:13.308 --> 01:17:17.746
He gets home, we're all sitting
around the dinner table in the kitchen

01:17:17.846 --> 01:17:20.215
and he doesn't say anything to me.

01:17:20.315 --> 01:17:24.239
All he says is, "Rough morning."

01:17:25.453 --> 01:17:27.723
That's all he says, "Rough morning."

01:17:27.923 --> 01:17:29.996
<i>I don't know. I mean...</i>

01:17:30.096 --> 01:17:32.346
<i>it's some kind of magic.</i>

01:17:32.693 --> 01:17:34.630
<i>Some kind of magic.</i>

01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:37.766
I'm going to faint.

01:17:37.866 --> 01:17:40.836
Fannie, what are you doing?

01:17:40.936 --> 01:17:44.105
You are eatin'. I can't believe it.

01:17:44.491 --> 01:17:46.675
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:17:46.775 --> 01:17:49.107
Oh, that's good.

01:17:52.681 --> 01:17:54.800
Thank God.

01:17:55.416 --> 01:17:58.354
Oh, thank God.

01:18:01.756 --> 01:18:03.834
<i>Thank God.</i>

01:18:07.595 --> 01:18:09.665
<i>Thank God.</i>

01:23:25.079 --> 01:23:27.240
"Angelo.

01:23:27.848 --> 01:23:30.051
"I'm sorry.

01:23:30.417 --> 01:23:33.756
"You've kept me at arms length
for so long...

01:23:34.989 --> 01:23:37.225
"with your distance...

01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:43.865
"circumstances and riddles

01:23:43.965 --> 01:23:48.537
left me confused and unsure."

01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:25.233
Hi.

01:25:25.733 --> 01:25:28.537
I... missed all the donuts.

01:25:28.936 --> 01:25:31.773
Running late? How you doing?

01:25:33.474 --> 01:25:35.043
Yeah.

01:25:35.676 --> 01:25:37.979
Fannie's doin' really good.

01:25:38.079 --> 01:25:42.851
She's eatin' and everything
and recovering so nicely.

01:25:48.622 --> 01:25:51.633
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

01:25:54.061 --> 01:25:56.850
I'm a tough man to be around.

01:25:57.998 --> 01:26:00.002
I'm a...

01:26:00.102 --> 01:26:03.274
angry man. I'm very angry.

01:26:03.937 --> 01:26:06.274
A toaster burns my toast.

01:26:06.374 --> 01:26:08.243
The toaster's gone.

01:26:08.343 --> 01:26:10.646
I'll throw it out.

01:26:11.945 --> 01:26:14.449
I'll kill the table too.

01:26:15.949 --> 01:26:18.987
Yeah, but I'm not quite
so angry around you,

01:26:19.087 --> 01:26:20.856
you know.

01:26:22.723 --> 01:26:25.127
I'd like to try things again.

01:26:27.294 --> 01:26:29.896
I enjoy your company.

01:26:30.431 --> 01:26:32.134
I do.

01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:37.329
I didn't mean to be rude.

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:43.145
It's that easy?

01:26:45.312 --> 01:26:49.250
I don't know, yeah... what you mean?

01:26:50.083 --> 01:26:54.589
I'm sorry, but it isn't easy, no.

01:26:59.293 --> 01:27:01.997
So you know you're a son of a bitch.

01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:04.833
Yes.

01:27:05.033 --> 01:27:07.068
Yes, you do.

01:27:07.168 --> 01:27:09.704
Yeah. I'm aware of it.

01:27:09.804 --> 01:27:12.428
I'm a son of a bitch. Kinda.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:14.715
Who isn't?

01:27:17.778 --> 01:27:20.182
I like your smile, Dawn.

01:27:22.716 --> 01:27:27.689
I think... you are a beautiful lady.

01:27:28.722 --> 01:27:31.278
And I want you to know...

01:27:31.378 --> 01:27:34.936
that I think that.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.104
So what do you say?

01:27:46.974 --> 01:27:50.178
God, you are gonna have to work.

01:27:50.378 --> 01:27:52.013
Okay.

01:27:52.113 --> 01:27:56.952
- I mean charm level at 10.
- I know. I'll go 12.

01:27:58.051 --> 01:28:02.190
- 12.
- Level 12 with the charm.

01:28:02.489 --> 01:28:04.759
It's gonna take a while.

01:28:05.665 --> 01:28:07.962
I've got nowhere to go.

01:28:09.363 --> 01:28:11.849
I'm gonna clean the house.

01:28:14.735 --> 01:28:16.753
That's for sure.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.544
Alright. Get out of here.

01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:26.815
- So next Friday.
- See you next Friday.

01:28:27.314 --> 01:28:30.285
Maybe I'll just come by,
you know, tomorrow.

01:28:31.084 --> 01:28:34.923
Have a donut and some coffee, you know.

01:28:35.889 --> 01:28:38.093
Say hello.

01:28:40.193 --> 01:28:42.964
Okay, Carl, the world is yours.

01:28:43.064 --> 01:28:45.602
- Alright, see you next week.
- Oh, you bet.

01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:05.246
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:30:05.346 --> 01:30:07.574
<i>Jacob, it's me.</i>

01:30:07.982 --> 01:30:10.818
<i>And I'm just calling to say...</i>

01:30:10.918 --> 01:30:14.082
<i>just leave a message on your telephone.</i>

01:30:15.221 --> 01:30:18.560
<i>I went to church. I tried to pray.</i>

01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:23.431
<i>And I went to work and I...
I tried to become an artist.</i>

01:30:23.998 --> 01:30:26.868
<i>I think I'm gonna buy paints
and I'm gonna try.</i>

01:30:26.968 --> 01:30:29.437
<i>I'm gonna paint on a big canvas.</i>

01:30:29.537 --> 01:30:32.173
<i>I'm gonna clean out my garden.
I'm gonna dig up the roots.</i>

01:30:32.273 --> 01:30:35.510
<i>I'm gonna start somethin' fresh.</i>

01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:40.148
<i>And try nice foods for a change.</i>

01:30:42.015 --> 01:30:45.686
Oh, you piss me off, Jacob,
but I love you.

01:30:45.786 --> 01:30:50.925
And I need to say that to you now.
I need to make sure that you know it.

01:30:51.908 --> 01:30:54.745
<i>On the day you were born, I fainted.</i>

01:30:54.845 --> 01:30:56.564
<i>I just fainted.</i>

01:30:56.664 --> 01:30:59.667
<i>Who knows. Something overtook me.</i>

01:30:59.767 --> 01:31:03.581
<i>And I fell on the hospital floor
and I laid there like a...</i>

01:31:03.681 --> 01:31:06.114
<i>like a rag doll.</i>

01:31:06.606 --> 01:31:08.810
Your mother was sick, I remember that

01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:11.846
so I had to take you home.

01:31:11.946 --> 01:31:15.482
She couldn't leave the hospital,
so I had to do it.

01:31:15.582 --> 01:31:17.759
<i>And there I was on the bus.</i>

01:31:18.019 --> 01:31:19.521
<i>Just you and me...</i>

01:31:19.721 --> 01:31:24.862
<i>rolling along and listening to the sounds
of the people around us.</i>

01:31:25.126 --> 01:31:27.795
<i>And the drone of the motor from that bus</i>

01:31:27.895 --> 01:31:30.398
<i>and the joy in my arm.</i>

01:31:31.465 --> 01:31:36.314
<i>You and I, we got off the bus
we met my old friend for coffee.</i>

01:31:36.671 --> 01:31:40.975
<i>She looked at me
when she saw you and she said...</i>

01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:45.580
<i>"Pal, you know what love is."</i>

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:51.019
<i>You don't realize that everyone is jealous
of how good you got it now.</i>

01:31:51.751 --> 01:31:55.757
By that I mean how much love
you have inside you.

01:31:57.124 --> 01:32:01.096
Some day you'll know
just how good that is.

01:32:24.384 --> 01:32:25.854
I'm locked out.

01:32:36.596 --> 01:32:38.500
You missed.

01:32:38.832 --> 01:32:41.236
I don't speak mime.

01:32:44.572 --> 01:32:46.975
Oh, yeah, that's clever.
