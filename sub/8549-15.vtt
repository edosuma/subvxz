WEBVTT

00:05.106 --> 00:07.641
OKAY, ALRIGHT.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.310
LET'S SEE...

00:11.379 --> 00:12.546
MUNCHIES.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.750
COMFY COUCH.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.221
REMOTE CONTROL.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.798
AHH, THE GOOD LIFE.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.103
OKAY, MOM, BRING IT IN.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.937
ALRIGHT, SWEETHEART.

00:37.004 --> 00:37.971
BE CAREFUL, HARRIETTE.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.408
YEAH, OKAY

00:43.777 --> 00:46.547
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD UP.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.550
HARRIETTE, I'M TRYING
TO WATCH THE FOOTBALL GAME.

00:49.617 --> 00:53.687
-LOOK AT MY NEW PLAYHOUSE.
-THIS BABY'S REALLY LOADED--

00:53.754 --> 00:56.157
IT'S GOT A TABLE, A PHONE,
A SWINGING DOOR..

00:56.224 --> 00:57.625
A MORTGAGE.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.594
GOOD LUCK PUTTING IT
TOGETHER, UNCLE CARL.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.564
OH, HARRIETTE.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.467
PLEASE, UNCLE CARL?

01:07.701 --> 01:10.638
RICHIE, I'LL PUT IT TOGETHER
AFTER THE GAME.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.039
HOW LONG IS THAT?

01:12.106 --> 01:13.307
THREE HOURS.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.677
I'LL BE TOO BIG
FOR IT BY THEN.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.982
BUT, RICHIE, IT'S THE BEARS
AND THE VIKINGS.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.118
PLEASE, UNCLE CARL?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.853
I LOVE YOU...

01:25.919 --> 01:27.221
A BUSHEL AND A PECK

01:27.288 --> 01:30.524
AND A HUG
AROUND THE NECK.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.462
OKAY, OKAY

01:34.528 --> 01:37.165
-HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
-MM-MMM.

01:48.742 --> 01:52.380
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION
IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:52.446 --> 01:55.949
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:56.016 --> 01:59.887
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:59.953 --> 02:04.292
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

02:04.358 --> 02:07.195
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

02:07.261 --> 02:11.399
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

02:11.465 --> 02:14.868
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

02:14.935 --> 02:18.906
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'

* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY **

03:13.994 --> 03:15.929
HI, BIG GUY.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.932
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:18.999 --> 03:22.870
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST WEAR A HAT
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.541
STEVE, I'M IN
NO MOOD FOR THIS.

03:27.608 --> 03:32.413
WHY THE SOUR PUSS,
MY PORTLY POUTING PAL?

03:32.480 --> 03:36.049
WELL, I HAVE TO ASSEMBLE
THIS PLAYHOUSE FOR RICHIE.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.751
OOH, YOU WANT SOME HELP?

03:37.818 --> 03:38.919
NO, THANKS.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.988
I MEAN, IT'S JUST A KID'S TOY.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.324
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

03:44.024 --> 03:46.560
YIKES!

03:46.627 --> 03:48.329
NO PROBLEMO.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.997
JUST PUT YOURSELF
IN THE HANDS

03:50.063 --> 03:52.966
OF MASTER
BUILDER URKEL.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.535
OKAY, YOU READ
THE INSTRUCTIONS

03:54.602 --> 03:56.637
WHILE I LAY OUT
ALL THE PIECES.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.971
OKAY.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.209
"MUN-JE IL--
CHEE-GOOM

04:02.276 --> 04:03.911
"IN-UHN
MUHL-GOHN DUHRURH

04:03.977 --> 04:05.679
"CHOGNG HWAK-KI

04:05.746 --> 04:08.949
CHOM-KOHM
HA-SHIP-SHI-YO."

04:10.351 --> 04:12.386
WHAT ARE YOU
BABBLING ABOUT?

04:12.453 --> 04:13.887
THIS PAGE
IS IN KOREAN.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.657
TSK, TSK, TSK.
THEY MISSPELLED THREE WORDS.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.595
YOU CAN READ KOREAN?

04:21.662 --> 04:23.864
WHY, SURE, IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.968
I'LL TEACH YOU. LET'S START
WITH A COMMON KOREAN PHRASE.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.372
NOMO-GIETS-ITSOMERA.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.308
MUT-IROSOMERA.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.709
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

04:35.776 --> 04:38.746
I'VE FALLEN
AND I CAN'T GET UP.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.518
I'LL GET US SOME TOOLS.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.554
YOU, LAY OUT ALL
THE PIECES.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.391
I'VE FALLEN
AND I CAN'T GET UP.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.330
HARRIETTE,
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED CARL

04:56.397 --> 04:57.831
TO BUILD
RICHIE'S PLAYHOUSE.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.068
AFTER ALL, HE'S NOT
EXACTLY MR. FIX-IT.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.636
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.406
REMEMBER LAST MONTH
HE INSTALLED THAT
EXTRA LIGHT SOCKET?

05:05.473 --> 05:08.141
IT WORKS PERFECTLY.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.510
THAT'S TRUE,

05:09.577 --> 05:13.781
AND HIS EYEBROWS HAVE
JUST ABOUT GROWN BACK.

05:13.847 --> 05:17.150
JOLENE, I'VE GOT A
CHEST HAIR UPDATE FOR YOU.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.152
I'M UP TO A DOZEN.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.523
BY THIS SUMMER...
I SHOULD BE A RUG.

05:25.959 --> 05:26.727
ATTENTION, EVERYBODY.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.497
I CAN'T FIND
MY SCREWDRIVER.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.064
I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.600
ME, NEITHER.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.710
EXCUSE ME.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.612
EXCUSE ME.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.915
DAD, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF
A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.

05:50.618 --> 05:54.655
BINKY BEAR CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE HIS WINKY BEAR.

05:54.722 --> 05:58.726
EDWARD, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.361
YEAH, LAST WEEK,
I USED IT
TO FIX MY BIKE.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.063
WELL, WHERE IS IT NOW?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.465
DAD, I DON'T KNOW.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.366
I'M BUSY HERE.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.770
SORRY, WINKY BEAR,
BUT BINKY BEAR

06:09.837 --> 06:13.140
HAS TO TALK
TO PAPA BEAR. BYE-BYE.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.576
DAD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT!

06:15.643 --> 06:17.811
EDWARD, WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH MY SCREWDRIVER?

06:17.878 --> 06:20.648
-I DON'T REMEMBER.
-YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

06:20.714 --> 06:23.250
WHY CAN'T YOU REMEMBER
WHERE YOU PUT
ONE SCREWDRIVER?

06:23.316 --> 06:25.018
BECAUSE THAT'S
NOT IMPORTANT.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.054
GIVE ME
A BREAK, OKAY?

06:31.792 --> 06:35.162
EDWARD, I HAVE TOLD YOU
A THOUSAND TIMES

06:35.228 --> 06:38.832
THAT WHEN YOU BORROW
MY TOOLS, PUT THEM BACK
WHERE THEY BELONG.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.801
OKAY, OKAY.

06:40.868 --> 06:44.572
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN
TO MISPLACE MY TOOLS.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.541
MY DAD MISPLACED ONE
OF HIS TOOLS ONCE.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.342
BOY, WAS HE UPSET.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.512
OF COURSE, HE'S
A BRAIN SURGEON.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.547
SO, IT'S TOUGH WONDERING
WHICH OF YOUR PATIENTS

06:53.614 --> 06:56.650
HAS A CLAMP
IN HIS CRANIUM.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.587
STEVE, THIS IS
A FAMILY DISCUSSION.

06:59.653 --> 07:03.457
AND I'M DARN PROUD
TO BE PART OF IT.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.526
SHOO, SHOO, SHOO, SHOO.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.562
EDWARD, I WANT TO KNOW

07:08.629 --> 07:10.330
WHERE MY SCREWDRIVER IS.

07:10.397 --> 07:14.201
DAD, I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
LOOK, I'LL BUY YOU A NEW ONE.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.436
EDWARD, I CAN DO THAT MYSELF.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.371
GREAT. THANKS, DAD.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.541
HOLD IT!

07:20.608 --> 07:22.576
EDWARD, YOU'RE STILL
MISSING THE POINT HERE.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.044
WHAT IS THE POINT?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.814
THE POINT IS, THIS
SCREWDRIVER INCIDENT

07:26.880 --> 07:28.549
IS JUST
ANOTHER EXAMPLE

07:28.616 --> 07:30.450
OF YOUR TOTAL LACK
OF RESPECT

07:30.518 --> 07:32.419
FOR PEOPLE AND
THEIR PROPERTY.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.854
IT IS?

07:33.921 --> 07:35.388
YES, IT IS.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.924
YOU START OFF BY
FORGETTING SCREWDRIVERS,

07:36.990 --> 07:39.392
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE DROPPING
OUT OF SCHOOL,

07:39.459 --> 07:40.728
YOU CAN'T GET A JOB,

07:40.794 --> 07:42.763
AND YOU WIND UP WEARING
A CARDBOARD BELT,

07:42.830 --> 07:45.899
SELLING YOUR BLOOD
FOR A BOWL OF SOUP.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.901
WHAT KIND OF SOUP?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.270
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

07:50.337 --> 07:54.074
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S YOUR STORY.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.109
UH, I GOT TO GET GOING.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.547
HOLD IT, EDWARD.
WE ARE NOT THROUGH HERE.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.215
-I'VE TO GET READY FOR MY DATE.
-NO, YOU DON'T.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.484
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.119
WHAT?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.788
OVER A STUPID
SCREWDRIVER?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.223
SON, IT'S NOT
THE SCREWDRIVER.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.892
IT'S YOUR ATTITUDE
I DON'T LIKE.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.895
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.565
UH-OH.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.169
ALRIGHT. THAT'S IT.
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.370
LOOK, DAD--

08:23.436 --> 08:24.805
GO!

08:27.340 --> 08:31.945
CARL, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION?

08:33.313 --> 08:36.449
AS THE GREAT MAHARISHI
MOSKVICH ONCE SAID--

08:36.516 --> 08:37.918
SCRAM!

08:37.985 --> 08:40.954
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID
BUT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.773
EDDIE.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.508
SHH!

09:01.575 --> 09:02.943
-GOING SOMEPLACE?
-YES.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.245
I'M TAKING JOLENE
TO THE CONCERT.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.080
AND YOUR LIFE
IN YOUR HANDS.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.417
EDDIE, DAD GROUNDED YOU.
IF YOU LEAVE,
HE'LL KILL YOU.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.052
LAURA, IT'LL BE WORTH IT

09:12.119 --> 09:14.588
TO SEE JOLENE IN
HER NEW MINISKIRT.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.489
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, EDDIE.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.858
FOR WHAT?

09:17.925 --> 09:20.293
YOU'LL BE MAKING LICENSE PLATE
FOR YOUR FIRST CAR.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.896
LAURA, THANKS FOR
YOUR CONCERN.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.199
BUT AS THEY SAY
IN FRANCE, SIONARA.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.829
DAD! HI.

09:55.896 --> 09:56.930
HI.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.900
HEY, YOU FOUND
THAT SCREWDRIVER.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.836
WELL, ACTUALLY,
URKEL FOUND IT.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.405
HE USED HIS METAL DETECTOR
AND COMBED OUR BACKYARD.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.608
HE FOUND THE SCREWDRIVER,
38 CENTS,

10:08.676 --> 10:11.078
AND A MOOD RING.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.813
GREAT.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.614
SO WHERE WERE YOU?

10:14.682 --> 10:17.584
UH, I WAS IN THE GARAGE

10:17.651 --> 10:19.687
LOOKING FOR
THE SCREWDRIVER?

10:20.854 --> 10:23.691
REALLY? SO IS THIS

10:23.757 --> 10:25.558
YOUR SCREWDRIVER
HUNTING OUTFIT?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.560
WELL, I--I...

10:27.627 --> 10:29.863
LIPSTICK
ON THE COLLAR.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.835
EDWARD,
WERE YOU NECKING

10:34.902 --> 10:36.804
WITH THE
WEED-WHACKER AGAIN?

10:39.406 --> 10:43.010
OKAY, DAD, I WENT TO
THE CONCERT WITH JOLENE.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.880
YOU, UH...

10:46.947 --> 10:49.216
YOU REALLY LIKE
THAT GIRL, DON'T YOU?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.651
I SURE DO, DAD.

10:54.888 --> 10:58.125
I HOPE SHE'S WORTH
DYING FOR.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.192
LOOK, DAD--

10:59.259 --> 11:00.227
NO, YOU LOOK.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.530
EDWARD, I WENT UP TO
YOUR ROOM TO APOLOGIZE

11:03.596 --> 11:06.033
THINKING MAYBE I WAS
TOO ROUGH ON YOU.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.068
BUT JUDGING FROM YOUR BEHAVIOR,

11:08.135 --> 11:09.970
I HAVEN'T BEEN
ROUGH ENOUGH.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.671
DAD, YOU JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.707
THIS DATE WAS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME TONIGHT.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.308
WELL, I HOPE
YOU ENJOYED YOURSELF.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.145
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE ANOTHER ONE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.014
-YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR ONE MONTH.
-WHAT? NO WAY.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.350
-MAKE THAT TWO MONTHS!
-WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

11:23.416 --> 11:25.719
MOM, DAD'S ACTING LIKE
A MANIAC AGAIN.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.120
MAKE THAT THREE MONTHS!

11:27.187 --> 11:29.222
-CARL!
-LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.959
AS LONG AS YOU
LIVE UNDER MY ROOF,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.927
YOU WILL
LIVE BY MY RULES.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.163
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD
FIND ANOTHER ROOF.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.364
EDDIE!

11:37.430 --> 11:40.067
-SO YOU'RE MOVING OUT?
-WELL, YEAH.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.268
WELL, FINE!

11:41.334 --> 11:42.335
FINE!

11:42.402 --> 11:44.204
FINE!

11:46.539 --> 11:47.707
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:47.775 --> 11:49.743
FINE!
FINE!

12:12.365 --> 12:13.666
CARL.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.302
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT!

12:15.368 --> 12:16.904
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.872
THIS THING'S GOTTEN
WAY OUT OF HAND.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.540
WE CAN'T LET EDDIE MOVE OUT.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.309
WHERE'S EDDIE GOING?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.311
NOWHERE. GO BACK TO BED.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.213
CAN I HAVE HIS ROOM?

12:26.679 --> 12:28.015
GO!

12:29.282 --> 12:32.019
GUYS, I FEEL TERRIBLE.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.922
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU TO
PUT TOGETHER RICHIE'S PLAYHOUSE.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.224
I'M HIS MOTHER.IT'S
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.059
TRUE, I'M NO GOOD
AT THOSE THINGS,

12:39.126 --> 12:41.261
BUT WE LEARN
BY DOING.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.329
RACHEL--

12:42.395 --> 12:44.564
BUT I DIDN'T DO.
NOW LOOK
WHAT I'VE DONE.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.835
YOU'RE MAD AT EDDIE, EDDIE'S MAD
AT YOU, I'M MAD AT ME.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.004
I TELL YOU,
THIS IS A MADHOUSE.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.907
THIS WHOLE FAMILY
HAS GONE OFF
THE DEEP END.

12:53.974 --> 12:57.510
CARL, WE CAN'T LET
OUR SON MOVE OUT.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.912
HARRIETTE...

12:58.979 --> 13:01.781
I WILL NOT TOLERATE
OUTRIGHT DISOBEDIENCE.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.216
NOW, I DON'T ASK FOR MUCH,

13:03.283 --> 13:06.019
BUT THERE'S ONE THING I DO
DEMAND AND THAT'S RESPECT.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.988
YOU KNOW
EDDIE RESPECTS YOU.

13:08.055 --> 13:11.124
HARRIETTE, THE BOY
DELIBERATELY ANTAGONIZES ME.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.827
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
THAT GETS MY GOAT.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.996
CARL, BE FAIR.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.900
YOUR GOAT'S GOTTEN OLD,
AND IT'S EASIER TO GET.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.935
OH, SURE.
TAKE HIS SIDE.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.438
THERE ARE NO SIDES HERE.
WE'RE A FAMILY.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.075
PLEASE GO UP
AND TALK TO EDDIE
AND SETTLE THIS.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.110
HARRIETTE, HE'S THE ONE
WHO DISOBEYED.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.945
HE'S THE ONE
WHO WANTS TO LEAVE.

13:32.012 --> 13:36.049
SO, HE'S THE ONE WHO
HAS TO COME TO ME.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.118
CARL--

13:38.185 --> 13:40.587
HARRIETTE,
I HAVE SPOKEN!

13:46.927 --> 13:50.363
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
KING CARL.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.900
BUT IF PRINCE EDWARD
LEAVES THIS KINGDOM,

13:52.966 --> 13:55.835
YOU WILL BE SLEEPING
ON THE ROYAL COUCH.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.044
EDDIE...

14:04.111 --> 14:05.578
GO BACK UPSTAIRS.

14:05.645 --> 14:10.450
MOM, I'M LEAVING. DON'T TRY
AND TALK ME OUT OF IT.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.919
OH?

14:11.985 --> 14:14.121
WELL,
WHERE YOU GOING?

14:14.187 --> 14:17.524
SOMEPLACE WHERE
THEY DON'T HAVE
ANY SCREWDRIVERS.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.127
YOU KNOW THIS FIGHT'S
NOT ABOUT SCREWDRIVERS.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.029
IT'S BECAUSE YOU
DISOBEYED YOUR FATHER.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.097
BUT, HE DIDN'T
HAVE TO GROUND ME.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.598
THAT WAS
EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.300
POLICE BRUTALITY.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.271
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.206
DON'T WORRY, MOM.
I'LL BE FINE.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.208
-WHERE WILL YOU SLEEP?
-I DON'T KNOW.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.810
-WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR MONEY?
-I DON'T KNOW.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.813
-HOW WILL YOU BUY FOOD?
-I DON'T KNOW.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.284
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU HAVE A PLAN.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.620
WELL, MOM, ANYTHING IS
BETTER THAN STAYING HERE.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.122
YOUR FATHER'S
NOT THAT BAD.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.425
OH, REALLY?
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
LIVING WITH HIM?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.129
BUT DAD
DRIVES ME CRAZY.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.999
DID YOU EVER THINK
THAT MAYBE YOU
DRIVE HIM CRAZY?

14:59.066 --> 15:02.502
SURE, TAKE HIS SIDE.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.038
EDDIE.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.374
YOU KNOW YOUR
FATHER LOVES YOU.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.476
MOM, HE SURE DOESN'T
ACT LIKE IT.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.079
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
IT'S NEVER GOOD ENOUGH.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.114
HE'S ALWAYS ON MY BACK.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.316
I DON'T EVEN THINK
HE LIKES ME.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.090
WAIT HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.764
HARRIETTE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:31.831 --> 15:33.600
COME, COME.
COME ON. SIT DOWN.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.502
EDWARD, YOU, TOO.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.769
HARRIETTE--
MOM--

15:36.836 --> 15:38.005
SIT!

15:39.572 --> 15:41.341
THE REASON YOU TWO
DON'T GET ALONG

15:41.408 --> 15:43.110
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.045
NO WAY!
NO WAY!

15:45.112 --> 15:46.313
LOOK AT THIS.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.049
THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT
MEN IN MY LIFE

15:49.116 --> 15:50.550
ACTING LIKE
BIG BABIES.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.651
HE STARTED IT.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.819
NUH-UH!
DID, TOO.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.587
DID'NT.
DID!

15:54.654 --> 15:57.724
LISTEN UP, YOU TWO!

15:57.790 --> 16:00.660
NOW, I WANT
TO TELL YOU A STORY--

16:00.727 --> 16:01.894
-MOM!
-AW, HARRIETTE--

16:01.961 --> 16:03.963
AH! UNH!

16:05.598 --> 16:07.600
NOW...

16:07.667 --> 16:09.602
THIS IS A TRUE STORY.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.105
IT HAPPENED 16 YEARS AGO...

16:12.172 --> 16:16.009
ON JANUARY 28, 1974.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.012
MY BIRTHDAY?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.480
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE,

16:20.547 --> 16:23.450
BUT YOU WERE
AS IMPATIENT THEN
AS YOU ARE NOW.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.654
WE HAD JUST MOVED
INTO THIS HOUSE.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.524
AND WE HADN'T FINISHED
UNPACKING. IT WAS 1:30
IN THE MORNING,

16:31.591 --> 16:34.394
IN THE MIDDLE OF
A TERRIBLE SNOWSTORM.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.263
ALRIGHT.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.464
OKAY

16:49.309 --> 16:50.710
OKAY

16:50.777 --> 16:52.812
CARL!

16:52.879 --> 16:54.714
YOU'RE FORGETTING
TWO THINGS--

16:54.781 --> 16:56.616
YOUR WIFE
AND YOUR PANTS.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.917
OH!

16:57.984 --> 17:00.420
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.921
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:01.988 --> 17:03.490
YEAH,
I'M JUST SWELL.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.559
COME ON, LET'S GO
CUT SOME LUMBER.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.863
IT'S A WONDER
YOU EVER MADE A BABY

17:10.930 --> 17:12.632
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.469
THINGS WENT
FROM BAD TO WORSE.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.037
WE WERE COMPLETELY
SNOWED IN.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.406
THE PHONES WERE DEAD,

17:19.472 --> 17:21.841
AND WE HAD NO WAY
TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL.

17:21.908 --> 17:25.912
SO WE DID WHAT
ANYONE WOULD DO--
WE PANICKED.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.081
CARL...RELAX.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.083
RELAX. RELAX.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.185
YEAH, RELAX.
UH-HUH.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.586
NOW, YOU'RE A COP.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.021
I'M A COP.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.789
YOU'RE TRAINED TO HANDLE
THESE SITUATIONS.

17:36.856 --> 17:40.059
I'M TRAINED.
I TOOK A CLASS ONCE.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.594
THE BABY
WAS PLASTIC.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.697
I PUT HIM
ON THE RADIATOR,
AND HE MELTED.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.166
AAH!

17:46.233 --> 17:48.668
AAH! WHAT HAPPENED?
TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.670
-GO BOIL SOME WATER!
-GOOD IDEA!

17:50.737 --> 17:51.904
I COULD
USE SOME COFFEE!

17:51.971 --> 17:53.673
AAH!

17:53.740 --> 17:56.543
TEA! COCOA! SWEETHEART,

17:56.609 --> 17:59.011
I'LL DRINK
ANYTHING YOU WANT!

17:59.078 --> 18:01.548
AAH! OH! CARL, CARL,
THE BABY'S COMING!

18:01.614 --> 18:04.184
HAND ME A PILLOW!
HAND ME A PILLOW!

18:04.251 --> 18:05.885
PILLOW! PILLOW!

18:05.952 --> 18:08.255
OH!

18:08.321 --> 18:10.590
I CAN'T
FIND A PILLOW!

18:12.058 --> 18:13.626
OH!

18:13.693 --> 18:14.961
CARL! CARL! CARL!

18:15.027 --> 18:16.963
PILLOW! PILLOW!
PILLOW!

18:17.029 --> 18:18.465
OH!

18:18.531 --> 18:20.032
OH! OH!

18:20.099 --> 18:22.569
HARRIETTE, YOU'RE
FALLING OFF THE COUCH!

18:22.635 --> 18:23.603
OH!

18:23.670 --> 18:25.037
GET IT TOGETHER, BABE!

18:25.104 --> 18:26.373
OH! OH!

18:26.439 --> 18:28.808
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.009
LET'S BREATHE.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.043
LET'S BREATHE.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.078
BREATHE.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.180
BREATHE, CARL.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.748
OKAY WE'RE
BREATHING. OKAY.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.886
I LOVE YOU, HONEY.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.654
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.723
BUT YOU'RE NEVER
TOUCHING ME AGAIN.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.966
FINALLY THE PHONE STARTED
WORKING AGAIN.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.735
AND WE CALLED OUR DOCTOR.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.470
HE SKIED RIGHT OVER

18:57.537 --> 19:00.373
JUST IN TIME TO BE TOO LATE.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.677
CARL, YOU DID
A GREAT JOB.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.079
GEE, THANKS, DOC.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.782
YOUR WIFE AND YOUR SON
ARE DOING JUST FINE.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.384
THANKS. OKAY.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.190
HELLO, MOM.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.659
HELLO, DAD.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.861
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HOLD YOUR SON?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.663
OH, YEAH.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.174
HELLO, EDWARD.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.245
I'M YOUR DAD.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.149
ISN'T HE BEAUTIFUL?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.817
OH, YEAH.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.953
LOOKS
JUST LIKE YOU.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.390
I THINK HE LOOKS
MORE LIKE YOU.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.191
YEAH, HE DOES.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.127
EDWARD.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.563
MY SON.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.600
WHAT A WONDERFUL WORD.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.938
YOU KNOW, I'M REAL
NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.641
I NEVER BEEN
A FATHER BEFORE.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.877
THEN AGAIN, YOU NEVER
BEEN A SON BEFORE.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.346
I TELL YOU WHAT--

20:13.413 --> 20:15.815
WE'LL LEARN TOGETHER.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.587
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU...

20:20.653 --> 20:23.690
I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL OF MY HEART.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.693
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET
HOW PROUD I AM...

20:26.759 --> 20:28.961
RIGHT NOW....

20:29.028 --> 20:30.363
SON.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.984
DID YOU REALLY
SAY THOSE THINGS?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.423
WELL...AHEM.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.558
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.665
DAD, I'M SORRY
I DISOBEYED YOU.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.301
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SNUCK OUT.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.337
WELL, I MIGHT HAVE
OVER-REACTED...

21:10.403 --> 21:11.738
A LITTLE.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.806
I CAN PROMISE YOU
ONE THING--

21:13.873 --> 21:16.709
I'LL NEVER LOSE
ANOTHER SCREWDRIVER.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.480
YOU KNOW...

21:21.514 --> 21:22.915
I REMEMBER ONCE...

21:23.983 --> 21:25.918
I USED
MY FATHER'S HAMMER

21:25.985 --> 21:28.655
TO MIX
A CAN OF PAINT.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.624
AT THE TIME,
HE DIDN'T THINK

21:31.691 --> 21:33.993
THAT HAMMERS
SHOULD BE PURPLE.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.363
MAN.

21:36.429 --> 21:40.066
HE GROUNDED ME
FOR ONE WHOLE WEEK.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.937
MAN, I THOUGHT
HE WAS THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST JERK.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.639
NOW LOOK AT ME.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.541
I'M HIM.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.978
DAD, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

21:52.044 --> 21:56.883
ONE DAY I'LL PROBABLY HAVE A KID
WHO'LL DRIVE ME CRAZY, TOO.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.018
I SURE HOPE SO.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.760
DAD...

22:09.195 --> 22:11.030
I'D LIKE TO STAY.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.769
I WOULD LIKE THAT,
TOO, SON.
