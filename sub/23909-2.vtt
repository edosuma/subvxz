11:01.228 --> 11:03.263
- So, uh, what are you
driving now?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.799
- A 2007 Celica G.T.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.135
- Ooh, the 'Stang's
quite an upgrade.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.703
Fully loaded.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.905
I mean, she handles
like a dream.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.240
- She's gorgeous.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.711
- My Celica's been good to me,

11:17.745 --> 11:20.714
but she's pushing 100,000
miles, so...

11:20.748 --> 11:21.849
- She's dependable.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.984
- Sad to see her go,
but...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.053
I think it's time to
change things up a bit.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.487
- I thought the
exact same thing.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.758
- You know, you see something
shiny and new

11:30.791 --> 11:32.860
and you just forget
about what you got.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.294
Once you upgrade,
those memories,

11:34.327 --> 11:36.096
they come back and they--
they haunt you.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.734
You know like, uh,
road trip with the kids.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.469
- Oh, I don't have kids.

11:42.502 --> 11:46.506
- The fun stuff you did in
the backseat in high school.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.242
- I haven't had it that long,
so...

11:49.276 --> 11:51.211
- The crazy thing is,
you thought you were the one

11:51.244 --> 11:53.280
sick of her,
and now you'd do anything

11:53.313 --> 11:54.848
to get her back.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.986
- You--you do sell cars here,
right?

11:59.019 --> 12:01.521
- Don't give up on your Celica.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.824
- Maybe...
Maybe if we test drove it--

12:03.857 --> 12:04.892
- You'll regret it.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.095
- Yeah, uh, okay.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.104
- Come on, baby.
Let's go, let's hustle!

12:17.137 --> 12:19.172
- Pace yourself!
Don't be a hero!

12:19.206 --> 12:21.008
- Run, baby!
Get the ball!

12:22.275 --> 12:24.044
Time out!
Time out!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.245
Water break!

12:25.278 --> 12:27.881
She needs water.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.249
- Come on, girls.
Get back in the game.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.952
Can we keep it together please?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.153
- She shouldn't overdo it.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.187
- She's doing great.
She's fine.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.188
Look at her.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.124
- Yeah, I see.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.059
And what about when we can't
afford that damn truck anymore?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.160
What happens then?

12:40.193 --> 12:41.261
- Cops get real good insurance.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.262
- You're not a cop yet.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.330
- Yeah, I will be.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.765
- Yeah, in six months, babe.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.336
- Okay.
Okay, look.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.238
I know you're not used to this.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.974
- Neither am I.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.042
I mean, we haven't been here
in a long time.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.311
- This.
Right here, right now.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.948
It's what winning feels like,
babe.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.883
Our girl's strong enough
to run and play in the sunshine

13:02.916 --> 13:03.884
for the first time in years.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.152
I don't know about you,

13:05.185 --> 13:07.988
but I'm gonna drink
in this moment.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.023
- Fine, drink up.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.860
- Oh, I'm gonna need a little
bit more than that.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.163
- I'm gonna need you to say it.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.266
- You're crazy.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.834
- Say it with me.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.035
We are winning.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.871
- We're winning.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.405
- Yeah, I'm sure you can do
a lot better than that.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.808
- We are winning.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.079
- Mean it.
Come on, baby.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.016
- We're winning.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.151
- Yes,
that's what I'm talking about!

13:38.185 --> 13:40.020
- We're winning!
- Yes!

13:40.053 --> 13:41.989
Come on, baby!
Let's go!

13:42.022 --> 13:43.156
We're winning, baby!

13:43.190 --> 13:45.092
We are winning!
Let's go!

13:45.125 --> 13:46.927
We are winning!

13:46.960 --> 13:48.061
- No, we're not!

13:48.095 --> 13:49.329
- I'm sorry, baby.
I know.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.931
I know, just stay focused,
baby!

13:50.964 --> 13:53.400
Stay focused.
- We are winning.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.302
- Get back inside, coach.
My bad.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.170
Stay in the game, baby.
Stay in the game.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.342
*

14:02.375 --> 14:04.311
- That's $13.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.647
This is some bull right here.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.117
Them coming at us with guns,
dropping by my job,

14:10.150 --> 14:11.919
uh-uh.
We have families.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.420
We have children.
We have lives.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.623
And we gotta end this now.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.125
- Great.
How?

14:18.158 --> 14:19.960
- The way I see it,
we got two issues

14:19.993 --> 14:21.228
we need to take care of.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.030
One is your boy
up in that tree house.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.231
- Excuse me,
he's not my boy.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.465
- And the money.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.301
- Yeah, so two birds,
one stone.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.205
Y'all are already getting
charged for kidnapping.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.274
We might as well ransom
his ass, too.

14:42.615 --> 14:42.950
.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.687
Just let me go already.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.489
- Yeah, so you can run
to the cops?

14:49.522 --> 14:51.491
- It's not like you're
gonna kill me.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.462
- 'Cause you don't
have the guts.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.364
You're not killers.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.933
You're just a dumb
checkout girl.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.670
And you're, what,
a housewife?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.472
Thought you'd pull a fast one?
Hmm?

15:05.505 --> 15:06.573
Make a quick buck?

15:06.606 --> 15:08.041
Now you guys are freaking out

15:08.075 --> 15:10.010
because you are in
way over your head.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.511
- Just shut up.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.046
- Only reason I'm up here
is 'cause you don't know

15:13.080 --> 15:14.547
what to do with me.
- Just shut up!

15:14.581 --> 15:17.050
- You have no idea.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.920
'Cause girls like you,
you never think things through.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.458
- No, he's right.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.960
You do do this.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.461
I mean, you've done this
your whole life.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.063
I mean,
you make these big messes,

15:30.097 --> 15:32.966
and then you just expect
everyone else to clean it up.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.568
And then you just ignore it.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.005
For hours.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.408
Hours become days,
and days become weeks.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.112
- Yes, and weeks sometimes
turn into months.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.514
You're so right.
I do do that.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.516
Mmm.
Fatal flaw.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.086
- You can't leave me
here forever.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.621
- Oh, we wouldn't mean to.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.623
- No, right, but like you said,

15:56.656 --> 15:59.526
we don't have the guts
to kill you.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.729
And it's just we're in
so far over our heads,

16:02.762 --> 16:05.565
I feel like it's gonna take us
a really, really long time

16:05.598 --> 16:07.400
to figure out what
to do with you.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.070
- And by then,
the animals

16:10.103 --> 16:12.539
or just Michigan winter
would probably

16:12.572 --> 16:14.607
would probably just take care
of it for us.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.009
*

16:16.043 --> 16:18.145
- I'm just a dumb
checkout girl.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.413
- And I'm just
an idiot housewife.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.385
- His grandma's loaded.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.120
- And she doesn't trust banks,

16:27.154 --> 16:29.722
so she keeps all of her cash
at home like Scrooge McDuck.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.059
- Where should we
have her bring it?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.594
- Well, they always do the drop
in a park in "Law & Order,"

16:34.627 --> 16:36.529
so how about Beeman?

16:36.563 --> 16:38.665
- All right, check out this app
I downloaded onto his phone.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.667
- We have your grandson.

16:40.700 --> 16:44.237
Deliver $60,000 to Beeman
Park by 5 p.m., or he's dead.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.774
- No, it's just Scottish Man.
Here.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.577
- Sounds hot.
- What about...

16:50.610 --> 16:52.145
We have your grandson.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.713
Deliver $60,000--
- No, no.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.415
- She wouldn't get that.
- Okay, uh, let's see here.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.417
We have your grandson.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.686
Deliver $60,000 to Beeman
Park by 5 p.m., or he's dead.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.088
- That's good.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.089
- I think that's good.
- Yeah.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.190
- All right.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.226
Whew, okay.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.698
- You've reached
Marion Petersen.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.833
I'm not home right now.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.768
Please leave a message.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.439
- Try later.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.743
- You've reached
Marion Petersen.

17:23.776 --> 17:27.647
- * Baby

17:27.680 --> 17:29.816
- You've reached
Marion Petersen.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.184
I'm not home right--

17:31.218 --> 17:32.685
*

17:32.719 --> 17:35.155
- You've reached Marion--

17:35.188 --> 17:36.556
- I'm not home--

17:39.892 --> 17:41.861
- * I wish I was dead

17:41.894 --> 17:45.265
- I mean,
if she's out for the night...

17:45.298 --> 17:49.136
*

17:49.169 --> 17:51.604
- Everyone has to use
their own toothbrush.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.607
And no one goes
in the backyard tonight.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.143
We just sprayed for bugs,

17:56.176 --> 17:59.779
and it's covered
in very toxic chemicals.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.616
I won't be late.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.118
I just have a thing with
my sister and a friend.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.753
- Oh, a girls night.
- Yeah.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.223
- * I'm gonna tear up
the lexicon *

18:10.257 --> 18:11.891
* With a hexagon and
my sexy thong on *

18:11.924 --> 18:13.726
* No matter where your
head is gone *

18:13.760 --> 18:14.827
* Or where you're from,
I'ma take you on *

18:14.861 --> 18:16.263
* It's not about you

18:17.364 --> 18:19.666
- Ugh, of course.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.334
It's a security door.
We don't have a code.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.735
- All right,
will you just be cool?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.304
- I hate it when you say that.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.905
- This is so much easier
than the grocery store.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.707
She's not even home.
- Okay, here we go.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.841
Here we go.
Here we go.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.179
- * It's not about you

18:32.212 --> 18:34.581
* Shut up
It's not about me either *

18:34.614 --> 18:36.749
* I am my sister's keeper

18:36.783 --> 18:37.850
* Chill

18:37.884 --> 18:39.652
* It's not about you

18:39.686 --> 18:42.155
* Shut up
It's not about me either *

18:42.189 --> 18:44.224
* It's us verse
the grim reaper *

18:44.257 --> 18:46.259
* Chill chill chill

18:46.293 --> 18:49.862
* You look like a tortoise
Your issues are enormous *

18:49.896 --> 18:52.799
* In my eyes you're flawless
I'm gonna share my cake *

18:52.832 --> 18:53.933
* Whoo

18:53.966 --> 18:55.802
* It's time to drop

18:55.835 --> 18:57.604
- You're gonna rake through
with the tumblers.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.806
- Go back to the part with
the second pin thingie.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.242
- I'm trying.
- Stop flipping it around.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.876
Just hold it one...

19:04.911 --> 19:06.379
- It's buffering.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.215
- That unlimited data plan
sounds real nice

19:08.248 --> 19:10.350
right about now, doesn't it?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.290
- Marion!

19:17.324 --> 19:19.692
You're up and about!
That's great!

19:19.726 --> 19:21.394
We were told that you
would be bedridden

19:21.428 --> 19:22.929
and to just let ourselves in.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.833
- We're the volunteers.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.835
Medicare automatically
enrolls you

19:28.868 --> 19:30.803
to receive a number
of services.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.873
Tidying up, meal prep,
companionship,

19:33.906 --> 19:35.174
whatever you need.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.211
Should we come back
another time?

19:38.245 --> 19:39.412
Or is this a bad time?

19:40.980 --> 19:44.317
- Well, I suppose not.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.619
- You are an incredible liar.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.289
- Thank you.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.623
- * It's not about you

19:50.657 --> 19:51.791
* Shut up

19:51.824 --> 19:53.360
* It's not about you

19:57.297 --> 19:57.464
.

20:00.433 --> 20:05.505
*

20:05.538 --> 20:07.640
- Got any family in town,
Marion?

20:07.674 --> 20:11.378
- My husband passed last year.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.747
- I'm so sorry.
- Such is life.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.583
We had 40 years.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.285
Five children.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.753
Sixteen grandchildren.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.555
- Wow, that must keep you busy.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.824
- Every one of them moved away.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.426
Can you believe that?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.596
They're just too into
their own lives.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.998
Except Leslie.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.534
He's my little boy.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.505
Oh, and this is his fiancee.
Isn't she pretty?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.407
- Very.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.510
Jessica Alba?

20:43.543 --> 20:46.846
- I know what you're thinking,
but she's only half.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.818
How about some of this
no

20:52.785 --> 20:54.587
- Marion,
where's your restroom?

20:54.621 --> 20:55.788
- Oh.

21:24.851 --> 21:28.355
- * It's gonna take a lot
to take me away from you *

21:30.390 --> 21:31.858
- Help me!

21:31.891 --> 21:34.661
- * There's nothing that
a hundred men or more *

21:34.694 --> 21:37.397
* Could ever do

21:37.430 --> 21:42.602
* I bless the rains
down in Africa *

21:42.635 --> 21:49.476
* Gonna take some time to do
the things we never had *

21:49.509 --> 21:50.677
* Ooh

21:50.710 --> 21:57.750
*

22:00.587 --> 22:05.758
* It's gonna take a lot
to drag me away from you *

22:05.792 --> 22:08.728
* There's nothing that
a hundred men or more *

22:08.761 --> 22:11.431
* Could ever do...

22:23.576 --> 22:30.617
*

22:56.976 --> 22:58.811
- Yeah, they're fine.

23:00.447 --> 23:04.150
- No, it's input, satellite,
some--

23:04.183 --> 23:05.885
You know what?
Tell them there is no TV.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.687
It's too late.
- Okay, but the kids are--

23:07.720 --> 23:09.656
- No, what--what--
Wait, wait.

23:09.689 --> 23:10.990
What's that noise?

23:12.925 --> 23:15.595
- No, that noise.
Where's that coming from?

23:17.530 --> 23:20.166
- Be sure that you really get
back in that corner, now.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.203
- You gonna make the white girl
clean something?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.605
Or does she just get to eat?

23:25.638 --> 23:28.575
- Mmm, Doug looks
so skinny here.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.578
Oy, Gloria.
Are you ever not pregnant?

23:31.611 --> 23:32.779
Right here, hand me the--

23:32.812 --> 23:34.547
- We've gotta go.
Now.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.519
- Sorry, Marion.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.655
You didn't take it?

23:42.689 --> 23:44.491
- I told you,
Dean is in my backyard.

23:44.524 --> 23:45.525
I can't do this.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.793
- No, we're doing it.
Stop.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.495
- Why didn't you
take the money?

23:48.528 --> 23:49.762
- I couldn't do it.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.998
- You couldn't rob the sweet
old racist lady?

23:52.031 --> 23:54.233
- She had this life.
She had this full life

23:54.266 --> 23:55.835
that she loved.

23:55.868 --> 23:59.506
Come on, we're robbing
lonely old people?

23:59.539 --> 24:00.807
This is who we are now?

24:00.840 --> 24:03.576
- What we are is screwed
because you choked.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.045
- Beth!

24:07.246 --> 24:08.648
We needed that money!

24:08.681 --> 24:09.882
- I know.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.017
I'm sorry.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.553
I gotta go.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.688
- Okay, yeah, we'll just
talk about this tomorrow

24:15.722 --> 24:17.557
when we're all dead!

24:30.002 --> 24:31.938
- I told you not
to mow the lawn.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.840
- Well, good thing I did,

24:33.873 --> 24:35.908
'cause guess what
I found back there?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.647
- Moles.
Those tiny little rat thingies

24:40.680 --> 24:41.848
that build tunnels.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.249
We got them, like,
really bad.

24:43.282 --> 24:47.253
- No, I have them.
I have the moles.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.254
- Okay.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.789
- In my backyard.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.024
In my house that I
paid the mortgage for,

24:52.058 --> 24:56.062
and am perfectly capable of
handling all the aspects of.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.598
Including the lawn.

24:58.631 --> 24:59.866
And the remote control.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.968
And--

25:06.906 --> 25:07.940
- I took it off.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.511
- I don't know.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.847
- Oh.

25:23.956 --> 25:27.126
You can throw chewed-up
bubble gum

25:27.159 --> 25:29.996
into the mole hole and...

25:30.029 --> 25:32.732
They'll choke and die.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.767
- That's terrible.

25:34.801 --> 25:35.835
- I know.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.844
Thank you.

26:05.632 --> 26:08.000
- It's the middle
of the night.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.836
- I'm making lasagna.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.675
- You have to reheat at 350,
okay?

26:17.810 --> 26:18.911
- What, do you plan
on going somewhere?

26:19.946 --> 26:21.681
- You tell me.

26:21.714 --> 26:22.849
You don't wanna act like
you're not gonna be around

26:22.882 --> 26:24.016
to feed us no more.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.686
- Oh.
An island sounds good.

26:28.154 --> 26:31.724
- Oh.
Island.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.960
With one of those huts, mmm.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.963
Where you could see the ocean
through the floor.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.097
- Hmm, yeah.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.735
I might come.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.738
- I'm sorry,
it's my imaginary island.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.175
- I mean,
you can make conjugal visits.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.683
Hey.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.619
You'd tell me if something
was going on, right?

27:02.789 --> 27:05.725
- Baby...

27:05.758 --> 27:07.760
- I'm just making lasagna.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.901
- Why don't you come on
back to bed?

27:15.902 --> 27:17.837
And bring some of that
sauce with you.

27:27.279 --> 27:34.687
*

27:38.124 --> 27:42.829
*

27:42.862 --> 27:45.698
- Oh, honey, it's so late.
Why aren't you in bed?

27:45.732 --> 27:47.700
- I woke up,
and you were gone.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.838
- She's always sexting
her boyfriend.

27:51.871 --> 27:55.908
*

27:55.942 --> 27:57.944
- It's scary when you wake up
and I'm gone, huh?

27:57.977 --> 27:59.846
*

27:59.879 --> 28:03.182
Well, there's something you
need to know about mommies.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.484
Sometimes they go away.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.886
But guess what?

28:07.920 --> 28:10.022
- They always come back.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.191
No matter what.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.760
Okay?

28:13.793 --> 28:17.063
*

28:17.096 --> 28:18.264
Come on.

28:18.297 --> 28:24.837
*

28:24.871 --> 28:28.040
Did Kristen teach you
that word?

28:28.074 --> 28:29.108
Sexting?

28:29.141 --> 28:30.910
- Mm-hmm.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.079
*

28:33.112 --> 28:35.047
- Well, I'm glad
I gave her a raise.

28:35.081 --> 28:38.284
*

28:38.317 --> 28:39.952
- Um, she sleeps with
a nightlight.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.220
- Sadie.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.221
She sleeps with a nightlight,
okay?

28:42.254 --> 28:44.023
- She's 11 years old.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.925
- Yes, I know that.
That's why you just turn it on

28:45.958 --> 28:47.159
and you walk out of the room
so you don't embarrass her.

28:48.828 --> 28:49.996
- And she doesn't like
to swallow pills,

28:50.029 --> 28:51.063
so you have to make sure
that you get her

28:51.097 --> 28:52.331
the gummy vitamins, okay?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.202
- And she's gonna need to start
wearing a bra soon,

28:56.235 --> 28:58.004
so don't get her anything
too girly.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.072
Just get her something like
tank tops or something

29:00.106 --> 29:01.340
so that she can
have them layered.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.042
- Annie, Annie, Annie,
Annie, Annie.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.880
- I'm not gonna fight you
for custody.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.954
Why

29:14.987 --> 29:16.789
- Because I'm dealing
with some stuff.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.959
And...
I just can't.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.097
And she's a kid,
you know.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.999
- Uh-huh.

29:27.033 --> 29:29.368
- So don't make her take off
her shoes in her own house.

29:41.447 --> 29:41.780
.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.216
- Same as yesterday.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.552
- Bugs.

29:46.585 --> 29:49.188
- We cannot run.
We have families.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.958
- All right.
China.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.960
- Earthquakes.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.527
- That's your big issue
with China?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.363
- You have a better problem
with China?

29:57.396 --> 29:59.431
Language barrier,
human rights violations,

29:59.465 --> 30:01.167
communistic rule.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.169
- We're staying here,
and we are facing this.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.904
- Air pollution.
Swine flu.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.505
I mean--
- They don't have Indian food.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.340
I need to go someplace
where they have Indian food.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.010
- God, no.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.380
- Oh, I put Hans up on ebay.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.450
- The little drummer boy
I stole from Boomer's granny.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.352
- Annie, that is an heirloom.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.354
- Who's she gonna
pass it down to?

30:22.388 --> 30:23.956
Alba?

30:23.990 --> 30:26.592
Or her only one quarter Mexican
grandchildren?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.561
- Holy mother.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.865
- Hans is up to eight g's.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.600
- Shut the front door.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.922
- You're short.
- No, we're not.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.324
- Yeah, you are.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.892
- Actually...

31:01.493 --> 31:02.962
We're over.

31:02.995 --> 31:08.500
See, these are super
rare collectables.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.337
- Treasures.
- Yes, sister, you are correct.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.571
That's a better word for these.

31:12.604 --> 31:16.375
Because these super
rare treasures

31:16.408 --> 31:20.379
go for 10 to 15 g's on ebay.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.647
How much leg work is there,
right?

31:21.680 --> 31:24.250
But the truth is,
it's very little.

31:24.283 --> 31:27.653
Because we have done the lion's
share of the work for you.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.255
Ruby?

31:29.288 --> 31:31.023
- These are the usernames
and passwords

31:31.057 --> 31:32.558
for our ebay accounts.

31:32.591 --> 31:36.595
Plus auction tips to maximize
your profits.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.534
- You want me
to sell your dolls?

31:42.568 --> 31:44.070
- Tell him about Hans.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.638
- Ooh, our little drummer boy.

31:46.672 --> 31:51.343
The pride of Hamburg.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.013
You see, Hans here is one
of only 12 in the entire--

31:54.046 --> 31:56.983
all:

32:01.587 --> 32:04.323
11 in the world.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.626
- This some kind
of joke to you?

32:10.696 --> 32:12.564
I'm done playing with you guys.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.677
What are they doing?

32:25.711 --> 32:27.146
- Making it look like
a home invasion.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.983
- Please don't do this!
- Wait, please, wait!

32:31.017 --> 32:32.451
We can get you the money,
I swear!

32:32.484 --> 32:33.719
Please!
- We have families!

32:33.752 --> 32:34.753
- Please!
- We have kids!

32:37.089 --> 32:38.757
- Please, don't!

32:44.096 --> 32:47.333
*

32:47.366 --> 32:48.567
- You're an idiot.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.136
Beth!

32:50.169 --> 32:51.637
*

32:51.670 --> 32:53.039
- What, are you gonna
blow our brains out

32:53.072 --> 32:54.573
all over the room?

32:54.606 --> 32:56.142
'Cause that's how it works,
right?

32:56.175 --> 32:57.676
Someone shorts you,
and they get tossed out

32:57.709 --> 32:59.111
like trash?

32:59.145 --> 33:02.148
And no one cares,
and no one even notices.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.551
Your problem this time is
that's not us.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.053
We're normal people.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.155
*

33:09.188 --> 33:10.722
We pay our taxes and...

33:10.756 --> 33:12.624
*

33:12.658 --> 33:14.193
We take our kids
to P.F. Chang's,

33:14.226 --> 33:17.463
and we take orange slices
to soccer games.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.132
*

33:20.166 --> 33:22.101
And when bad things happen
to good people,

33:22.134 --> 33:25.104
everyone else goes crazy.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.106
It's all over the news.

33:27.139 --> 33:31.110
And there are all these
hashtags and movements.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.411
Because if it could
happen to us,

33:32.444 --> 33:34.413
it could happen to anyone.

33:34.446 --> 33:38.450
So if you wanna invite
all that attention

33:38.484 --> 33:40.719
over a few grand,

33:40.752 --> 33:44.490
then you're not the smart
businessman you think you are.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.692
Now, roll the dice.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.127
Tell him to pull the trigger.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.664
*

33:52.698 --> 33:53.799
See what happens.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.601
*

33:55.634 --> 33:57.669
- Please, please.

33:57.703 --> 34:04.776
*

34:07.579 --> 34:09.581
Oh, my God.

34:09.615 --> 34:14.086
*

34:18.190 --> 34:20.692
Sweet Jesus.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.783
This was my favorite
sangria bowl.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.618
- Well, it could have
been your face.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.521
- L'chaim.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.660
