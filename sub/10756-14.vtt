00:09.864 --> 00:12.503
Oh, dear, your chair's
got another big rip in the bottom.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.097
MARTIN:
Where?

00:14.264 --> 00:15.902
Hand me my reupholstery kit,
would you?

00:17.024 --> 00:18.503
Thanks.

00:19.424 --> 00:22.143
Oh, Dr Crane, don't you look smart.

00:22.344 --> 00:23.618
I don't feel smart.

00:23.784 --> 00:26.503
I've let Roz set me up
on another one of her blind dates.

00:26.704 --> 00:29.298
- Who's the lucky woman?
- Oh, a friend from her aerobics class.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.695
Well, perhaps it won't be too bad.
She's 32, has a terrific body,

00:32.904 --> 00:34.815
apparently thinks I'm God's gift
to broadcasting.

00:35.024 --> 00:37.492
Well, at least you have one thing
in common.

00:40.144 --> 00:42.897
When will you stop blighting
the environment with this atrocity?

00:43.064 --> 00:44.053
[DOORBELL RINGS]

00:44.224 --> 00:46.533
My God, can't you see
that it wants to die? Let it go.

00:47.424 --> 00:50.655
You know, I keep having this dream
where you say the same words,

00:50.824 --> 00:54.419
only I'm in the hospital,
and you're slipping the nurse a 20.

00:54.584 --> 00:56.654
- Dad, that will never happen.
MARTIN: Thank you.

00:56.864 --> 00:59.424
I have medical power of attorney.
It won't cost me a thing.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.862
- Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

01:03.024 --> 01:05.413
We were in the neighbourhood
for a pedicure and a seaweed wrap

01:05.584 --> 01:07.142
and we thought we'd stop by.

01:08.504 --> 01:10.620
- Of course, the pedicure was for...
- Stop right there.

01:10.784 --> 01:13.856
There's no way to finish that sentence
that'll make me proud.

01:15.664 --> 01:16.938
I have some wonderful news.

01:17.104 --> 01:19.220
I just signed a lease
for an apartment

01:19.384 --> 01:21.852
in one of the most exclusive buildings
in Seattle.

01:22.024 --> 01:23.298
- You don't mean?
NILES: I do.

01:23.464 --> 01:27.093
As of next week, I will be
a resident of The Montana.

01:27.264 --> 01:29.824
Niles, why would you even want to live
in such a stodgy building?

01:29.984 --> 01:31.940
When I applied there
they treated me like riffraff.

01:32.104 --> 01:34.060
If you're gonna ask
and answer your own questions,

01:34.224 --> 01:35.976
what do you need me for?

01:36.704 --> 01:38.934
The best part is I'll never have
to give my address again.

01:39.104 --> 01:42.141
From now on, I'll simply be
Dr Niles Crane, The Montana.

01:43.584 --> 01:45.017
DAPHNE:
That's a lovely building.

01:45.184 --> 01:47.459
I've only been there once,
applying for a job.

01:47.624 --> 01:49.740
Can't imagine anyone turning down
a chance to hire you.

01:49.904 --> 01:51.940
Well, I hope you're right.
I haven't heard yet.

01:52.104 --> 01:53.822
Well, good night.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.014
- Hey, Frasier, you don't think she...?
- Just relax, Dad.

01:59.184 --> 02:01.652
It's just her way of angling
for more vacation time.

02:01.824 --> 02:02.973
But what if she isn't?

02:03.184 --> 02:06.460
They'd have to call me for a reference.
Either way, she's not going anywhere.

02:07.904 --> 02:09.223
Gosh, that's uncanny, Dad.

02:09.383 --> 02:11.693
- What is?
- The way she's taken with you.

02:11.864 --> 02:15.413
Look at that.
She's absolutely mesmerized.

02:17.824 --> 02:19.735
- She is not.
- Oh, she is.

02:19.944 --> 02:21.775
She's just playing hard to get.

02:21.984 --> 02:23.975
Go to Grandpa. Go to Grandpa.
Go to Grandpa.

02:24.184 --> 02:25.776
Oh, hello, Grandpa. Oh, yes.

02:25.984 --> 02:27.656
Isn't she warm and cuddly?

02:27.864 --> 02:30.424
I see I'm going to have a tough
time tearing the two of you apart.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.937
FRASIER:
I'm gonna go out on a limb.

02:32.144 --> 02:33.896
The Montana doesn't accept pets,
does it?

02:34.104 --> 02:35.617
On the contrary, they welcome them.

02:35.784 --> 02:37.615
Just not cats or dogs.

02:39.424 --> 02:42.621
Well, then you're in luck, because
I don't know what the hell this thing is.

02:42.944 --> 02:44.935
There's no way that dog
is moving in here with us.

02:45.104 --> 02:47.413
Please? At least if she's here,
I'll be able to visit her.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.814
I cannot turn her over to strangers.
She worships me.

02:49.984 --> 02:51.019
FRASIER:
Oh, please.

02:51.224 --> 02:53.818
You must realize that that dog has
no genuine affection for you.

02:54.184 --> 02:55.378
You only pretend that she does

02:55.584 --> 02:57.495
because she's a canine substitute
for Maris.

03:01.304 --> 03:04.262
That is the most absurd psychobabble
I have ever heard.

03:04.464 --> 03:06.534
She's high-strung, cold to the touch
and ignores you.

03:06.704 --> 03:08.660
My God, stand her upright,
take ten pounds off her,

03:08.824 --> 03:11.179
put her in a Chanel suit,
what have you got?

03:13.984 --> 03:16.452
- I'm sorry, that's ridiculous.
- Is it really? All right, here.

03:16.624 --> 03:19.422
Remember the little pillbox hat that
Maris wore to the Duchamps wedding?

- Good morning.
- Hey, Frasier.

03:34.304 --> 03:38.092
- So how did it go with Rita last night?
- She didn't quite take to me.

03:38.304 --> 03:41.023
Oh, you're just being hard on yourself
like you always are.

03:41.184 --> 03:42.412
FRASIER:
You tell me.

03:42.624 --> 03:45.855
Over appetizers, she suddenly realized
she had a very early morning meeting,

03:46.024 --> 03:48.458
suggested that we skip
the jazz club after dinner.

03:48.664 --> 03:49.892
People have meetings.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.902
When the waiter suggested a soufflÃ«
that would take an extra 30 minutes,

03:53.064 --> 03:55.294
she said, "Oh, dear God, no."

03:57.064 --> 03:58.861
She was probably on a diet.

03:59.424 --> 04:00.698
After I dropped her off at home,

04:00.864 --> 04:03.059
I noticed that she'd left
her suede jacket in my car.

04:03.264 --> 04:04.663
I called to offer to swing it by,

04:04.824 --> 04:07.861
and she said, and I quote,
"Just keep it."

04:09.304 --> 04:10.896
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

04:11.224 --> 04:12.293
God, Roz, I have had it.

04:12.464 --> 04:14.136
You know, in the past six months
I have done

04:14.304 --> 04:16.214
everything a man can possibly do
to meet a woman.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.017
Singles bars, blind dates,
a lecture series at the museum.

04:19.184 --> 04:21.015
I've even spent hours in
the grocery store

04:21.184 --> 04:24.142
trying to look helpless
in the produce department.

04:24.384 --> 04:26.056
That's it. I'm taking myself
off the market.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.500
Frasier Crane has thumped
his last melon.

04:32.784 --> 04:33.853
You know, Frasier...

04:34.024 --> 04:35.935
Roz, Roz, please,
I know what you're going to say.

04:36.144 --> 04:37.702
I should climb back up
on that horse.

04:37.904 --> 04:40.020
I'm too great a catch
to give up now.

04:40.224 --> 04:42.692
- No, I think you should give up.
- What?

04:43.464 --> 04:45.455
Well, I don't really want to give up.

04:45.624 --> 04:47.979
I was just saying that
to get your sympathy.

04:49.064 --> 04:51.624
Look, this happens sometimes.

04:51.784 --> 04:54.252
When you're on a really bad streak,
you start to get desperate.

04:54.464 --> 04:56.295
Women can sense that.
They can smell it.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.453
- Smell it?
- Mm-hm.

04:57.624 --> 04:59.535
And trust me, when a guy starts
to get overeager,

04:59.704 --> 05:01.296
you know, like complimenting
you too much

05:01.464 --> 05:04.262
or laughing too hard at all your jokes,
you just wanna turn and run.

05:04.464 --> 05:05.658
- I don't do that.
- Oh, honey,

05:05.824 --> 05:08.099
wake up and smell...
Well, yourself.

05:09.824 --> 05:11.542
You just need to air it out a little bit.

05:11.744 --> 05:14.178
And in my experience,
the minute you stop looking,

05:14.344 --> 05:16.255
the perfect person
falls right in your lap.

05:16.464 --> 05:17.783
Well, Roz, as much as I appreciate

05:17.944 --> 05:20.014
you comparing me to a dead squirrel
in a heating duct,

05:20.184 --> 05:21.583

05:52.224 --> 05:53.816
Niles, why the bed
in the living room?

05:54.024 --> 05:56.618
It's not a bed, Dad.
It's an antique fainting couch.

05:56.784 --> 06:00.333
My goodness, they had furniture
for everything back then, didn't they?

06:02.544 --> 06:03.533
Glad you made it.

06:03.704 --> 06:06.457
Niles, this precious little building
isn't as exclusive as you think.

06:06.624 --> 06:07.977
Your doorman waved me
right through.

06:08.144 --> 06:10.897
- Well, that's because he knows you.
- Oh, a fan of my show?

06:11.264 --> 06:13.061
No, he lives in your building.

06:18.624 --> 06:20.694
So, Niles, what'd you do
about the dog?

06:20.904 --> 06:22.940
Oh, I found a wonderful family
to adopt her.

06:23.144 --> 06:26.295
Well, I'm sure it won't take you long
to adjust to being alone again.

06:26.464 --> 06:29.376
Actually, I won't have to. Follow me.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

06:29.584 --> 06:31.142
It was love at first sight.

06:31.304 --> 06:33.499
She's very exotic,
only eats every other day,

06:33.704 --> 06:36.502
and she's so white,
she's almost blue.

06:36.704 --> 06:37.853
Well, I'm getting nervous.

That's what he said just before
he introduced us to Maris.

You bought a bird?

06:51.824 --> 06:54.179
Well, I started to think
how quiet it would be around here,

06:54.344 --> 06:57.575
and, well, she is lovely,
and she's so affectionate.

06:57.744 --> 06:59.621

I love you.

07:01.184 --> 07:04.142
She says that all the time.

I love you, Grandma.

from her last owner.

do you, Baby?

Well, here, go to your food.
Go to your food.

Oh, good girl. Excuse me.

07:25.744 --> 07:28.338
Oh, you know, I've always been
fascinated by these birds

07:28.504 --> 07:29.983
that can actually learn how to talk.

07:30.144 --> 07:33.375
Oh, they can't talk. They just drill
a few words into them at the pet shop,

07:33.544 --> 07:35.500
and then they never learn
anything else after that.

07:35.704 --> 07:36.693
It is attractive, though.

07:36.864 --> 07:39.298
Yeah, well, that's the way they are.
Cute, but stupid.

Cute, but stupid.

07:42.664 --> 07:44.780
Daphne, perhaps we should
just leave these two alone.

07:44.944 --> 07:48.016
I sense a real battle of wits
shaping up here.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.096
NILES:
Thanks so much.

07:52.344 --> 07:54.858
Well, I'm off to an auspicious start
in the building.

07:55.064 --> 07:56.782
One of my neighbours got
my mail by mistake.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.900
Look at those bills.
What must she think of me?

07:59.064 --> 08:00.417
But, Niles, everybody gets bills.

08:00.584 --> 08:02.700
Not at The Montana.
They all have people.

08:02.864 --> 08:04.263
Yeah.

08:04.424 --> 08:06.176
Their bills go to their people.

08:06.344 --> 08:08.619
I want them to think
I have people too.

08:08.824 --> 08:10.940
I used to have people,
only they were Maris' people.

08:11.104 --> 08:13.220
Niles, you keep this up,
you won't even have the people

08:13.384 --> 08:15.454
who don't care
you don't have people.

08:16.024 --> 08:17.343
It just proves how essential it is

08:17.504 --> 08:20.064
to make a good first impression
when you move into a new building.

08:20.224 --> 08:22.294
Which is why I'm throwing
a dinner party Friday night

08:22.464 --> 08:23.499
for a few select residents.

08:23.664 --> 08:26.258
I'll show them such a good time,
there'll be no question I belong.

08:26.424 --> 08:27.698
- And I'm invited?
- Yes, you are.

08:27.864 --> 08:30.776
But I'm afraid you can't bring a date.
You know how I hate a crowded table.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.741
That's quite all right. I've taken myself
off the dating circuit.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.462
Afraid I was getting a bit desperate.

08:35.624 --> 08:37.057
Well, I was a bit concerned

08:37.224 --> 08:41.011
when you called to ask if Gloria
was our first or second cousin.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.582
Hey, Niles, you gotta see this.
Your bird's eating peanut butter.

08:46.744 --> 08:48.416
It's even funnier
than when Eddie does it.

And pretend you're my people.

FRASIER: Hello.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.057
I was looking for Dr Crane.
I found some more of his mail.

Oh, well, I'm a Dr Crane.
I'm Niles' brother.

gonna believe this,

09:17.664 --> 09:19.973
but when I was a freshman
at Harvard,

09:20.144 --> 09:21.862
I saw you perform the Pirate King

<i>in their production of
The Pirates of Penzance.</i>

- No, no, no, you were great.

09:28.024 --> 09:30.743
that I brought my husband back
to see you the next night.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.179
Well, I mean, he wasn't
my husband then.

09:33.384 --> 09:35.181
Well, actually,

19:34.024 --> 19:36.219
Birds today.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.096
You just don't know where
they pick things up.

19:40.584 --> 19:42.734
Well, shall we all join Peter
at the table?

19:42.904 --> 19:44.622
BABY:
Peter's a letch.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.140
- What did you say?
- I said, let's all sit down.

19:48.304 --> 19:50.022
BABY:
Peter's a letch.

19:50.224 --> 19:51.577
Is this your idea of a joke?

19:51.784 --> 19:54.173
I've had quite enough of this.
Come along, Carol.

19:54.384 --> 19:55.499
No, please, people, don't go.

19:55.664 --> 19:57.177
I did not teach
the bird these phrases.

19:57.344 --> 19:58.902
I don't know where
it picked them up.

19:59.104 --> 20:00.423
You'll stay, won't you, Stephanie?

20:00.624 --> 20:03.263
BABY:
Stephanie's horny.

20:04.624 --> 20:09.379
Oh, my God, is that what you've been
saying about me behind my back?

20:09.584 --> 20:11.654
No, I never said that about you.
I said it about me.

20:11.824 --> 20:13.860
I'm the horny one.
All I said was, you're very cute.

20:14.064 --> 20:15.622
Cute, but stupid.

20:19.024 --> 20:22.812
Well, thank you both
for a wonderful evening.

20:22.984 --> 20:24.656
- Good night.
- Please let me explain.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.463
I know we got off on the wrong foot,
but we are going to be neighbours...

20:27.624 --> 20:29.262
[DOOR BUZZES]

20:35.144 --> 20:39.217
- Well, thank you very much.
- Oh, please.

20:39.384 --> 20:41.852
- I've lost far more than you did.
- Oh, really?

20:42.064 --> 20:44.737
I've lost the most promising
romantic prospect I've had in years.

20:44.904 --> 20:48.453
What have you lost? The respect
of a posh lush and a Dutch letch.

20:48.624 --> 20:50.342
Try repeating that, Baby.

20:52.104 --> 20:53.856
All right.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.614
I apologize.

20:57.904 --> 20:59.576
Thank you.

20:59.744 --> 21:01.894
Perhaps I can drive you
to the vet now.

21:02.064 --> 21:03.861
Maybe we should take
the service elevator.

21:04.024 --> 21:05.013
Oh, what's the point?

21:05.184 --> 21:07.823
I don't think my reputation can suffer
any more than it already has.

21:07.984 --> 21:11.294
I wouldn't be so sure about that,
wearing a white bird after Labour Day.

21:12.305 --> 21:18.591
