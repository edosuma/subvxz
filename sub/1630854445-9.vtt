WEBVTT

00:13.638 --> 00:16.099
Obviously, I mean, I regret it.

00:17.058 --> 00:20.270
I just--
I-- I don't know what I was thinking.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.565
I just think
something else just took over.

00:27.819 --> 00:28.695
Wow.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.198
That is quite the story.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.199
I know.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.326
I really wish it wasn't true.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.585
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you before.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.003
It's just…

00:45.086 --> 00:46.463
…Judy has no idea.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.381
She loved Steve.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.760
And she
would just be so devastated

00:51.843 --> 00:54.345
if she knew that I

00:55.430 --> 00:56.931
was fucking him.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.896
Oh!

01:02.979 --> 01:05.565
<i>-Shit!
</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.211
I have to ask.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.089
Is that Steve's?

01:29.172 --> 01:31.716
Mmm. Yeah. Yep, yep.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.385
-Okay.
-It's a little Wood up in there.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.638
-I'm so sorry.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.474
You must think
that I'm just a horrible person.

01:39.557 --> 01:42.102
No, no, no.
Having an affair isn't a crime.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.313
-Or else my ex-wife would be in jail.
-Oh.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.363
-Oh!
-Are you…

02:06.000 --> 02:07.085
Oh…

02:07.836 --> 02:09.420
I'm fine. I'm all right.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.923
-Oh. Okay.
-Whew!

02:12.465 --> 02:14.384
Whew.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.261
I thought that was the end there
for a minute.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.430
-Oh, right.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.725
Well, anyway.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.687
I appreciate you being honest with me.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.606
I know it probably
took a lot to come here.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.402
Well, yeah, it's…
Just trying to do the right thing.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.695
Absolutely.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.657
And if we end up, let's say,

02:37.740 --> 02:40.326
finding your DNA on Steve's body,

02:41.411 --> 02:44.706
this'll certainly give us
one plausible explanation.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.459
Yeah. That it would.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.095
-Hi!
-Hey.

03:41.179 --> 03:45.183
Can I please have a small mint chip

03:45.266 --> 03:47.268
with chocolate sprinkles in a cup?

03:48.019 --> 03:51.189
Actually, can I have
a large in a waffle cone?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.608
Looks like you're having a nice day.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.193
I'm alive.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.570
What?

03:58.154 --> 03:59.155
I'm terminal.

04:10.041 --> 04:10.875
W-what?

04:11.459 --> 04:12.919
-I'm terminal.
-Stop saying that.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.171
-Well, you just asked me to.
-Okay…

04:15.255 --> 04:17.006
Tell me exactly what the doctor said.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.759
She said she was really sorry

04:19.842 --> 04:22.345
and that the chemo
didn't shrink my tumors.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.930
-What, like, not at all?
-Mm-mm.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.516
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It-- it had to have done something, okay?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.268
They just-- they need to do more.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.437
She also said that if it didn't work
this time, it won't work the next time.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.731
Oh, what-- what is she,
the authority on fucking cancer?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.191
-She's <i>an </i>authority.
-Okay, no.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.026
There are options.
There are always options.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.112
-Jen, no. Stop.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.365
The odds of the chemo working
were always really low.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.035
It's okay. Really.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.913
I've accepted it.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.957
Accepted what?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.501
Everybody dies, right?

04:53.584 --> 04:54.460
Shut up, Judy!

04:54.544 --> 04:56.170
You're gonna tell
a dying woman to shut up?

04:56.254 --> 04:57.422
-You're not dying.
-Jen.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.340
Okay, no. How about that, um…

04:59.424 --> 05:02.427
…that clinical trial, uh,
at St. Bridget's, right?

05:02.510 --> 05:03.720
No guarantee that'll it work,

05:03.803 --> 05:05.930
and it's way more intense
than what I just went through.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.266
Yeah, but guess what, you got through it.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.727
All right? I'm not saying
it's not gonna be hard.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.979
And I'm saying,

05:14.022 --> 05:16.441
if this is all the time that I have left,

05:17.483 --> 05:21.863
I wanna spend it swimming in the ocean
and hugging the people that I love.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.365
-Well, you're doing it, and that's final.
-You're not my mom.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.452
No, I'm not. I'm your best friend
who fucking gives a shit.

05:27.535 --> 05:31.205
Unlike your mom, who isn't here because
she's too busy being in fucking prison.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.498
Well, she's out, actually.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.167
Oh, well, good. More room for me.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.419
-You're not going to prison.
-Really?

05:37.378 --> 05:40.131
Then why did Agent Moron swipe my DNA?

05:40.214 --> 05:41.883
-What?
-Yeah.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.594
Karen saw him
going through the garbage.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.346
He took something out
and put it into a bag.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.722
What did he put in the bag?

05:47.805 --> 05:50.016
-My water bottle. It doesn't matter.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.893
If it didn't matter,
he wouldn't have taken it.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.354
Don't worry, all right?
Stress isn't good for the cancer.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.230
Well, stress isn't good
for the baby either.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.608
-What baby?
-There's a baby?

06:00.568 --> 06:02.195
Oh, fuck me.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.155
No fucking way.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.907
Whose is it?

06:07.825 --> 06:09.202
-Whose is it?
-What?

06:09.285 --> 06:12.372
Ben Wood pled guilty.
They're transferring him to County.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.874
Oh, well done, Prager. You got your guy.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.209
You should feel good.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.420
Yeah, well, uh, turns out
it doesn't feel very good

06:19.504 --> 06:20.838
sending a friend to prison.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.131
Oh, so now he's your friend?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.133
Uh, I mean…

06:24.217 --> 06:27.929
We're friendly. Okay, he's a good guy.
He-- he made a mistake, I admit.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.555
Well, you did the right thing.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.517
Sometimes the right thing doesn't
feel right, but it doesn't make it wrong.

06:33.976 --> 06:34.977
Yeah, I guess.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.398
You know…

06:38.481 --> 06:41.359
…the one thing I just-- I can't figure out

06:41.442 --> 06:44.529
is why Jen Harding
doesn't wanna press charges.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.864
I mean, she was a dog with a bone
when her husband got hit.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.699
Until she became BFFs with the driver.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.910
She's mercurial.
You never know what she's gonna do.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.161
Sure, but I mean…

06:52.245 --> 06:53.788
The brother hits her husband?

06:53.871 --> 06:56.916
The other brother hits her?
You think she'd hate that family.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.960
-Talk about a vendetta.
-Don't wanna talk vendetta.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.087
-There's no vendetta.
-How do you know?

07:01.170 --> 07:03.423
I know because Jen's pregnant
with Ben's baby.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.425
-What?

07:05.508 --> 07:07.844
-He didn't say anything about that.
-Because he doesn't know.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.637
She just hasn't had a chance
to tell him yet.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.055
But she had a chance to tell you?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.724
No, I mean, she just
was going through some stuff,

07:13.808 --> 07:15.226
so I just happened to be there.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.978
-Oh, my God.
-What?

07:17.061 --> 07:18.563
-You're friends with her.
-No, I'm not.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.731
That's why every time
I bring her up as a suspect,

07:21.441 --> 07:22.442
you jump to her defense.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.860
-No, I don't.
-You're doing it now!

07:23.943 --> 07:25.486
-No, I'm not. I'm not doing it!
-Relax!

07:25.570 --> 07:26.946
-Can you sit down?
-I'm sitting.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.407
-Stop talking. You're not sitting.
-I'm on my way to the seat.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.992
Mm-hmm. Just…

07:31.534 --> 07:32.410
Look.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.329
There's no harm
in admitting you like a person.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.082
I don't. Trust me, okay?
That woman and I are not friends.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.127
-Well, you're keeping her secrets.
-There's no secret-keeping going on here.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.045
-Did you tell Agent Moranis?
-Tell him what?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.923
-That Jen's carrying Ben's child.
-What's that got to do with anything?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.134
Who knows?
Maybe nothing, maybe everything!

07:48.217 --> 07:50.219
-What if it's all connected?
-What if it is?

07:50.303 --> 07:53.347
Then it'd be wrong
not to tell Moranis everything you know.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.563
-Yes, I am still here.
-<i>You sound angry.</i>

08:00.646 --> 08:03.483
Well, if I sound angry,
it's because I fucking am.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.984
<i>You have to use foul language?</i>

08:05.067 --> 08:06.736
Uh, yeah, I do have to use foul language

08:06.819 --> 08:08.905
because I think it's fucking shitty

08:08.988 --> 08:11.407
that you're not letting my friend
into your clinical trial.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.034
<i>-I said before it's closed.</i>
-Yeah--

08:13.117 --> 08:16.120
Yes, I understand that it is closed, okay?

08:16.204 --> 08:18.956
But what you don't understand
is that she is gonna fucking die

08:19.040 --> 08:20.917
if she doesn't get in,
you fucking dick fuck!

08:22.376 --> 08:24.337
Well, you know what?
If the dick fuck fucking fits.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.174
What-- Oh-ho-ho!
You did not just hang up on me.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.509
Fucking fuck!

08:32.303 --> 08:33.221
Hello.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.056
<i>Collect call from an inmate</i>

08:35.139 --> 08:37.517
<i>in South Orange County</i>
<i>Correctional Center.</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:40.144
<i>If you choose to accept these charges,</i>
<i>press one.</i>

08:42.230 --> 08:44.106
<i>Your call is being connected.</i>

08:46.442 --> 08:47.610
-<i>Hello?</i>

08:48.361 --> 08:49.362
<i>Ben?</i>

08:50.154 --> 08:52.240
Jen. Hey.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.243
Hey.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.370
<i>So good to hear your voice. </i>

08:57.453 --> 08:59.705
I wasn't sure if you'd accept the charges.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.166
Well, wasn't sure it was you.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.920
-Get a lot of calls from prison?
-Oh, you don't know my life.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.630
<i>-How are you?</i>

09:07.713 --> 09:08.756
You okay?

09:09.674 --> 09:13.010
<i>Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm hanging in there.</i>

09:13.594 --> 09:16.430
It's not that long
and even shorter on good behavior.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.516
So, you're looking at life, then, huh?

09:18.599 --> 09:21.269
Yeah, I don't wanna
stay here <i>that </i>long.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.521
It's a little scary here.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.108
<i>But it's also kind of a relief</i>
<i>taking some responsibility.</i>

09:28.359 --> 09:29.819
For something, at least.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.030
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.535
I'm so sorry.
You're the last person I wanna make cry.

09:37.618 --> 09:41.247
No, no, it's not you, Ben.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.499
It's Judy.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.001
Is she okay?

09:45.501 --> 09:46.836
Did she get her results back?

09:46.919 --> 09:50.006
Yeah, she did, and she's, uh, she's not.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.592
<i>I'm trying to get her</i>
<i>into this clinical trial.</i>

09:52.675 --> 09:54.468
Oh, God. Okay, that's good. That's good.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.387
Yeah, well,
I might have burned that bridge

09:56.470 --> 09:59.098
because I just called the doctor
a fucking dick fuck.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.934
Yeah, it might be tough
to walk that one back.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.061
<i>You have one minute remaining.</i>

10:04.145 --> 10:05.688
-Fuckin' Jesus. Really?
-I know, right?

10:05.771 --> 10:08.608
-It's like I'm in prison or something.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.776
<i>Poor Judy. That's just not fair.</i>

10:10.860 --> 10:13.362
I mean, she's like
an actual angel, you know?

10:13.946 --> 10:14.947
Yeah, I know.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.283
<i>Listen. </i>

10:18.534 --> 10:20.244
I know we're running out of time.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.289
But I can't wait any longer
to tell you how I feel about you.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.583
Okay.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.085
<i>And I know that, uh,</i>

10:29.629 --> 10:32.131
we got a lot of stuff
that we gotta work through.

10:32.214 --> 10:35.384
Oh, uh, well, yeah, there--

10:35.468 --> 10:37.011
Yeah, there definitely is.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.346
<i>Right, and, uh,</i>

10:39.013 --> 10:42.433
there's so much
that I have to make up for.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.935
-No, you…
<i>-But I gotta be honest with you.</i>

10:46.771 --> 10:48.564
Because I love you…

10:49.857 --> 10:53.235
…so much and you--
and I'm not expecting anything back.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.030
-You don't have to say a word.
<i>-No, no, no, no, no, Ben.</i>

10:56.113 --> 10:58.157
-I…
-<i>Your call has been terminated.</i>

10:58.240 --> 11:01.202
-Wait, Jen.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.997
I love you too.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.584
And I'm pregnant.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.838
And I killed your brother.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.841
Wasn't that Fresno?

11:15.925 --> 11:19.136
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Fresno was something else.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.638
-It was Bakersfield.
-Oh.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.933
I remember because you were so nervous
from cashing those checks,

11:24.016 --> 11:25.309
you threw up your McNuggets.

11:25.393 --> 11:29.480
Well, I was so sure the teller knew
that I wasn't you. I was like, 12.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.774
We were such a great team, you and me.

11:32.942 --> 11:33.943
Yeah.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.736
Gosh.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.572
Everything was so much easier
before they figured out DNA, huh?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.658
Yeah. Fuckin' science.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.868
Yeah. I mean, now,
if they have your DNA, I mean,

11:42.952 --> 11:45.913
it's kind of like there's nothing
you can do about it.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.915
-Is there?
-No.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.251
Why are you asking?

11:52.002 --> 11:54.004
-Did you do something, Judy Ann?
-What?

11:54.088 --> 11:57.383
No, I'm just… making conversation.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.761
Yeah, well, I have other hobbies now.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.639
I learned how to do nails
when I was inside.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.100
Oh, pretty! Look at-- what are those?

12:06.183 --> 12:08.811
Stars. No, wait, no. Hearts.

12:08.894 --> 12:09.854
They're cats.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.647
Of course. I see that.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.441
Looks good.

12:15.025 --> 12:18.195
Well, it looks like
you're really adjusting to your new life.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.239
It's a nice place.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.325
Yeah, well, you know,
as fancy as this place is,

12:23.409 --> 12:27.455
I was hoping maybe I could
slum it with you for a while.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.039
Get the old team back together.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.292
Oh.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.961
I could do your nails.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.922
That sounds nice, Mom.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.717
But I'm actually, um,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.969
not gonna be around for much longer.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.098
You going somewhere?

12:46.974 --> 12:49.185
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going somewhere.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.563
Hmm. Oh, sure.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.483
I mean, you gotta live your life.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.320
Oh, um, I have a…

13:00.029 --> 13:02.698
a little something
I wanted to give you before I left.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.326
Thanks.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.706
Well, I should

13:11.582 --> 13:12.708
get going.

13:14.668 --> 13:15.503
Bye, Mom.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.463
Bye.

13:23.594 --> 13:24.512
I love you.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.894
Judy Ann? Wait.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.772
Where you going?

13:34.855 --> 13:35.898
You didn't say.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.486
Oh, I'm, uh,

13:41.654 --> 13:42.780
going to Sonoma.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.116
To help a friend start a restaurant.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.159
Uh-huh.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.162
Good. Good luck.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.439
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

14:17.523 --> 14:20.776
-Come on, dipshit! Green means go!

14:21.402 --> 14:23.153
-Go!

14:23.821 --> 14:25.072
Fuck.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.782
-Mom.
-Yes.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.369
I know you're upset because Charlie
called you an irresponsible fuck face.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.829
Yes, he did. Yep, yep, yep.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.915
But I'm really excited about the baby.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.333
You are?

14:37.001 --> 14:39.628
Yeah, I mean,
I finally get to be a big bro.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.880
Aww.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.590
You are getting big, aren't you?

14:43.132 --> 14:44.425
Like, overnight.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.346
And, you know,
I think Dad would be chill with it too.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.473
Oh, he would be chill, huh?

14:52.099 --> 14:53.309
Why do you say that?

14:55.185 --> 14:57.730
When he died, there were only three of us,

14:58.480 --> 15:00.482
and now there'll be four again.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.401
Well, five with Judy.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.069
Yeah.

15:04.778 --> 15:05.863
And six with Ben.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.575
Right.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.165
Okay, just a second.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.346
What are you doing in here?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.391
Oh, sorry, I was just--
I was just grabbing a few things.

16:16.016 --> 16:16.892
I'm leaving right now.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.812
Jesus Christ. Does anybody
in this fucking family have boundaries?

16:19.895 --> 16:21.814
You think of me as family?

16:21.897 --> 16:23.857
Sure, why not? You fucked my dad…

16:23.941 --> 16:25.734
Guess that drunk loser fucked my mom…

16:25.818 --> 16:27.736
-So we're one big happy family now.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.989
Okay, well,
I'm going to get out of your hair

16:30.072 --> 16:33.826
and let you metabolize
all of this and everything.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.955
I just need
a second still.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.833
Are-- are you, um…

16:41.375 --> 16:44.420
Do--
do you want some-- some water or, uh--

16:45.462 --> 16:46.588
Well, I have this.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.175
Glacier Cherry?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.344
-Yep.
-That's my fave.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.304
Me too.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.810
Listen, I know you're upset
about the Ben thing.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.564
Well, I just don't get it.

17:03.647 --> 17:07.067
Uh, she hated my dad,
but she likes that guy?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.987
-She didn't hate your dad.
-She had a weird way of showing it.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.156
All she did was yell at him all the time.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.450
Okay, well, your mom can be a little hard.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.993
-But she's like a--
-A bitch.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.162
I was going for "rock."

17:19.246 --> 17:21.874
But that's the kind of mom you want
at the end of the day.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.420
Your mom is tough and solid, and…

17:28.005 --> 17:29.631
she's there for you, no matter what.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.925
Even if you almost kill her
in a hit-and-run?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.097
Yep, even then.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.767
Your mom is

17:40.517 --> 17:43.437
really good at forgiving people
when they fuck up,

17:43.520 --> 17:46.648
and that is a really hard thing to do.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.317
Because <i>she </i>is fucked up.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.568
Who isn't?

17:54.156 --> 17:57.117
Um, how long was this sitting there?

17:57.701 --> 17:58.619
Pretty long.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.538
I don't think it goes bad though.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.083
-Ooh. Yeah, okay.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.167
You can have that.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.128
-All right, I'm really going now.
-Okay.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.088
Here. Wait.

18:09.963 --> 18:12.216
-Oh, thanks.
-Okay.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.135
You come here.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.720
Right there.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.390
I love you.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.268
I love you too.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.126
-Bye, Mom!
-Bye, Boop!

18:48.043 --> 18:50.295
-Hey, Jana. Here you go.
-Oh.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.797
These your Cranes For Christ cranes?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.466
Yep, all fucking
million of 'em.

18:54.550 --> 18:58.095
Thanks. I have to say I'm surprised.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.055
-I didn't think you'd actually do them.
-Hmm.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.474
Because you seemed extremely mad
when I asked you.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.352
Mm, yeah, well, I actually didn't do them.

19:05.435 --> 19:06.311
-Oh.
-Yeah.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.189
My friend Judy did
while she was going through chemo.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.399
-So you can thank her.
-Oh.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.818
'Cause she is an angel.

19:12.901 --> 19:15.070
And I, I am a… I'm a cunt!

19:16.238 --> 19:17.281
-Oh.
-Yeah.

19:17.364 --> 19:20.200
-Yeah, I wouldn't use that word.
-Mm.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.536
-I mean, not in here anyway.
-Oh, He knows.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.454
-Oh.
-Everybody knows.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.833
Uh, do you mind if I ask, uh,
what kind of cancer your friend has?

19:28.458 --> 19:30.502
Um, cervical.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.796
Oh. How's her treatment going?

19:38.802 --> 19:40.262
It's not good.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.264
-It's not good at all.
-Oh.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.641
Well, I'm-- I'm sorry to hear that.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.352
Is it squamous cell, adno, or small cell?

19:47.436 --> 19:49.730
Um, small cell.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.857
Wait, how do you know that?

19:52.441 --> 19:53.692
-I'm a doctor.
-Oh.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.652
You are?

19:55.736 --> 19:57.362
Like, for people?

19:57.946 --> 20:00.949
-Yeah, I'm an OB-GYN. I told you that.
-Oh.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.951
No, you didn't.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.954
Yeah, I did.
Rem-- after the Easter Lamb Jam?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.831
We were standing right there.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.834
Oh, God, really? I-- I must have forgot.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.545
Yeah, I don't-- I don't think
you were actually listening.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.423
Well, yeah, that's--
that's a strong possibility.

20:17.424 --> 20:21.094
Hey, do you happen to know anyone
at the St. Bridget's Cancer Center?

20:21.178 --> 20:23.513
Oh, why? Is your friend
in the clinical trial up there?

20:23.597 --> 20:26.892
Oh, yeah, I wish. It's just…

20:26.975 --> 20:28.185
We missed the deadline, so…

20:28.268 --> 20:30.687
-Oh, that's too bad.
-Yeah.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.315
I can make a call if you want.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.943
Seriously?

20:36.026 --> 20:37.903
-Ah.
-Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.112
Oh, of course.

20:39.196 --> 20:43.200
Yeah, I used to be cuddle buddies
with the head of oncology up there.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.993
So he definitely owes me one.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.788
-Yeah, I let him do some weird stuff.

20:59.841 --> 21:02.678
Hey, Jude, it's me. I got some news.
Call me back, please.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.149
-Hey, Jude. What are you doing?
-Nice lawn.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.069
I'm-- I'm sorry. Do I know you?

21:19.653 --> 21:21.697
I'm Eleanor Hale. Judy's mother.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.864
She here?

21:24.533 --> 21:27.786
Uh, no, no. She's, uh,
picking up my son from choir practice.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.872
-Can't tell if that's a joke or not.
-Me neither.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.249
All righty, then.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.751
Uh, that's okay.
I'm just gonna wait for her.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.671
Why don't you just
come right the fuck on in?

21:49.308 --> 21:52.019
So, this is some, uh,

21:52.102 --> 21:54.521
<i>Real Housewives of Laguna</i> type shit, huh?

21:54.604 --> 21:56.189
Hmm. Thanks.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.943
I, uh,
didn't realize that you were

22:00.527 --> 22:01.570
out and about.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.905
So Judy's told you about me, huh?

22:03.989 --> 22:05.657
Oh, she might've mentioned a few things.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.409
Yeah, I wouldn't believe a word she says.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.787
-She's a natural-born liar.
-Look, I'm sorry, why-- why are you here?

22:10.871 --> 22:13.623
Oh, don't look so alarmed, honey.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.417
She came to see me first.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.835
She did?

22:16.918 --> 22:18.754
Oh, she didn't tell me that.

22:18.837 --> 22:22.090
Yeah, I'm sure there's lots of things
she doesn't tell you.

22:22.841 --> 22:26.303
Man, whatever gambit
she's got running this time,

22:26.386 --> 22:27.262
must be pretty sweet.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.306
She's not-- she's not running a gambit.

22:29.389 --> 22:32.934
-Who the fuck runs a gambit anymore?
-Oh, please.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.936
She didn't come by this honestly.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.606
Wait. She gave that to you?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.816
Yeah. Why?

22:40.692 --> 22:42.652
-She steal it from you?
-No.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.030
I'm sure it's from one
of her paintings that she sold.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.824
Oh, she's still doing
that painting thing, huh?

22:47.908 --> 22:51.370
-She's a really great artist, actually.
-Oh, well, good for her.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.872
Maybe that explains
why she doesn't want me around.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.290
Might ruin her image.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.084
Or maybe she just doesn't want you here.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.544
What kind of person
kicks her mother to the curb,

22:59.628 --> 23:01.713
gives her some bullshit
about going to Sonoma?

23:01.797 --> 23:03.882
-Does she think I'm some kind of idiot?
-What?

23:03.965 --> 23:06.426
I brought her into this world,
and now she can't help me?

23:06.510 --> 23:10.013
Why? 'Cause she's too busy
with her rich bitch girlfriends?

23:10.097 --> 23:12.140
-She has cancer.
-If she would just give me two weeks.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.351
-Two fucking weeks to talk to me--
-Did you hear me?

23:14.434 --> 23:16.269
-What?
-She has cancer!

23:17.187 --> 23:18.980
Your daughter has cancer!

23:23.026 --> 23:23.860
You sure?

23:23.944 --> 23:26.321
-Yes, I'm fucking sure.
-Oh, okay, all right.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.032
You just never know with Judy.

23:29.116 --> 23:32.202
Well, maybe you would know
if you had ever been around.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.006
She gonna be okay?

23:48.218 --> 23:49.553
-Hi.
-Oh, hey.

23:49.636 --> 23:52.097
Hey, Boopety-bops! Um…

23:52.180 --> 23:53.932
How was, uh, the practice?

23:54.015 --> 23:55.392
-It was good.
-Yeah?

23:55.475 --> 23:56.977
-Hey.
-Hey, sweetie.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.937
-Aren't you handsome?
-Yeah.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.691
-Uh, Henry, this is Judy's mom.
-I didn't know Judy had a mom.

24:02.774 --> 24:03.984
-Hmm, well…

24:04.067 --> 24:07.028
Uh, yeah,
she just dropped in to say hello.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.407
-Think you might be too late.
-Hmm, what? Why, where is she?

24:10.490 --> 24:12.200
I don't know where,
but she had a suitcase.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.285
What?

24:14.953 --> 24:15.954
Oh, f--

24:49.070 --> 24:51.615
Oh, Judy, what did you do?

24:58.663 --> 25:00.332
<i>Obviously, I regret it.</i>

25:00.415 --> 25:03.877
And if I could go back
and change what happened, I would,

25:03.960 --> 25:05.420
but it was like something just…

25:05.504 --> 25:07.631
…took over.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.634
That's quite a story.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.677
And Jen has no idea.

25:13.261 --> 25:16.264
She would be horrified
if she knew that I did it.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.684
That I killed Steve.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.646
So you're telling me
she doesn't know about any of this?

25:22.729 --> 25:23.730
No.

25:23.813 --> 25:26.608
Your best friend had no clue
that you kept his body in her freezer?

25:26.691 --> 25:27.609
Uh-huh.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.695
And then you used her car to transport it
to Angeles National Forest?

25:30.779 --> 25:32.906
-Uh-huh.
-During a girls' weekend?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.325
I'm a really good liar.

25:36.743 --> 25:39.454
Okay, so how do I know
you're not lying now?

26:05.564 --> 26:06.481
I don't get it.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.567
Why come to me?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.653
Why not go to the FBI
and try to strike a plea?

26:12.737 --> 26:15.031
I thought it'd be easier to tell a friend.

26:21.454 --> 26:24.416
I get a phone call, right?
That's still a thing?

26:26.793 --> 26:27.794
Yeah.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.921
Yeah, you get a phone call.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.342
Where is she?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.137
Where is she?

26:39.180 --> 26:40.348
You have five minutes.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.308
Okay. Thank you.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.225
Hey.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.687
Seriously, what the fuck?
Judy, what the fuck?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.022
-I know you're mad.
-Mad?

26:47.105 --> 26:51.067
What-- I don't even know what the fu--
Are you fucking, like-- You can't do this!

26:51.151 --> 26:52.277
I'm doing it for you.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.361
What? Fuck you!

26:53.445 --> 26:54.571
-Fuck me?
-Fuck you!

26:54.654 --> 26:56.740
-Jen.
-You got into the trial, Judy.

26:56.823 --> 26:59.242
You have to go. That is our plan.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.120
-No. No, no, no, no, that is your plan.
-No, no, no, no.

27:02.203 --> 27:05.206
I'm sorry. You have to take it back.
You have to tell them you didn't do it.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.334
I can't. It's too late. It's done.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.462
No, it's not too late.
There is always a way out.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.965
I don't know. I'll tell them
that you have chemo-brain or something.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.509
That's a thing.
People go nuts, you know, so they--

27:16.593 --> 27:19.179
-Jen. No.
-Don't-- Jesus Christ!

27:20.347 --> 27:22.057
Do you not even care what happens to you?

27:23.058 --> 27:25.810
You're fucking drowning,
and I am the only one paddling here.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.437
Stop!

27:27.520 --> 27:30.482
Stop fucking paddling and listen to me!

27:31.316 --> 27:34.903
This is my life,
and I can do with it what I want.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.446
-No. Judy, no!
-Yes!

27:36.529 --> 27:38.239
Yes! Stop!

27:38.782 --> 27:40.742
Jen.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.286
I'm dying.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.206
Okay, I know you don't wanna hear that,

27:46.706 --> 27:49.334
but that is actually what is happening.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.838
And this is a way out for both of us.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.633
I can't lose you.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.677
Okay?

27:58.760 --> 28:00.345
I can't lose…

28:00.428 --> 28:02.722
…another person. I-- my kids can't.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.017
I need you in this baby's life.

28:08.728 --> 28:09.896
-I need you.

28:13.733 --> 28:14.901
I will be there.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.238
-No matter where I am.

28:20.073 --> 28:23.660
-I will always be there, okay?

28:26.246 --> 28:28.581
Okay?

28:29.416 --> 28:32.585
Three weeks. That's all I need.
Just so she can do this clinical trial.

28:32.669 --> 28:33.503
Are you crazy?

28:33.586 --> 28:36.423
I-- I can't let her go.
She just confessed to murder.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.882
I'm not asking you to let her go.

28:37.966 --> 28:41.553
I'm asking you to just wait a few weeks
before you turn her in to the FBI.

28:41.636 --> 28:42.846
Why would I do that?

28:42.929 --> 28:45.515
Because she's already gotten
a death sentence.

28:47.183 --> 28:50.186
This treatment is the only chance she has.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.563
Look, I'm sorry.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.941
I'm really sorry, but the law is the law.

28:56.067 --> 28:56.985
You know Judy.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.238
And I think you have
a pretty good idea of who Steve was.

29:01.614 --> 29:04.367
She doesn't deserve to die like this.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.787
You can even put one
of those tracker thingies on her.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.372
-Jen.
-No, Nick.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.624
She's my best friend.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.502
I'm just asking for some more time.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.475
I told you I don't wanna do the trial.

29:30.852 --> 29:31.853
I heard you.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.572
-Does that thing itch?
-Yes!

29:43.782 --> 29:46.534
-Do you need, like, salve or something?
-I don't know.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.454
God, do you think I'm just
gonna get a big rash under there?

29:49.537 --> 29:51.623
That's the least
of your worries.

30:08.097 --> 30:08.973
Mom?

30:10.225 --> 30:11.392
Hiya, Judy Ann.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.937
What are you doing here?

30:15.021 --> 30:15.939
I, uh…

30:18.191 --> 30:20.276
I wanted to give you a proper goodbye.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.655
Before we send you off to Sonoma.

30:45.885 --> 30:49.180
Listen, you can report me,
get me fired, whatever.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.933
I just-- I couldn't
send Judy to go die in prison.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.476
Uh-huh?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.603
And it's just three weeks. I don't know.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.314
If that makes me a bad cop… fine.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.026
Well, if being a human being
makes you a bad cop,

31:02.110 --> 31:04.112
maybe they should rethink the whole thing.

31:08.074 --> 31:10.493
My career is over
if Moranis ever finds out.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.872
He's not gonna find out.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.674
-Oh, shit.
-Yep.

31:24.757 --> 31:26.092
-Oh, shit.
-Yep.

31:26.843 --> 31:30.179
I was on my way over to tell him
what I know, and this is how I found him.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.016
Room is completely ransacked.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.398
Do we have any idea who did it?

32:18.227 --> 32:20.438
You really think
we're gonna get away with this?

32:20.521 --> 32:21.606
Well…

32:21.689 --> 32:24.359
We're definitely getting away.

32:26.235 --> 32:27.737
Oh, my house hat!

32:51.552 --> 32:54.305
I mean, you've been talking
about going on vacation forever, right?

32:54.389 --> 32:55.682
I have.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.934
See? I listen.
