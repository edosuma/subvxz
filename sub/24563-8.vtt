01:26.738 --> 01:29.828
Don't forget, the best way

Just stop.

need you behind us.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.495
Yes!

12:37.582 --> 12:39.497
[wind gushing]

12:49.594 --> 12:51.118
[grunting]
Son!

12:52.336 --> 12:54.251
[grunting]

13:02.390 --> 13:04.261
[devilish laughter]

13:06.873 --> 13:09.136
- So--
- So what?

13:09.223 --> 13:11.834
I know we're supposed
to watch the Ninja.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.619
But I feel like all the cool
stuff is happening behind us.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.621
I'll look if you look.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.321
[devilish laughter]

13:21.278 --> 13:23.585
[dramatic music]

13:23.672 --> 13:25.805
Wow! That's awesome.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.028
What's awesome?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.987
[metal clanking]

13:38.121 --> 13:39.993
[intense music]

13:42.473 --> 13:46.173
I call upon
the lord of many names.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.349
Lord of Destruction!

13:48.436 --> 13:50.655
King of Shadows!

13:50.742 --> 13:53.223
Lord Garmadon!

13:53.310 --> 13:55.486
[dramatic music]

13:55.573 --> 13:58.011
Garmadon!

13:59.534 --> 14:01.928
[Lord Garmadon]
'Who..'

14:02.015 --> 14:05.322
'...called me..'

14:05.409 --> 14:06.323
'...here?'

14:07.716 --> 14:09.413
Leave my father alone!

14:09.500 --> 14:11.372
[music continues]

14:14.854 --> 14:16.725
[gasps]
Did you hear that?

14:16.812 --> 14:18.770
T-that sounded
like Lord Garmadon.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.903
We got to do something. Fast!

14:20.990 --> 14:23.210
Well, what are we waiting for?

14:23.297 --> 14:24.864
cling

14:24.951 --> 14:26.866
[clamoring]

14:31.218 --> 14:32.349
The Ninja.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.308
Wait! There's a trap.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.572
Start the wheel.

14:37.659 --> 14:38.790
[laughing]

14:41.228 --> 14:44.013
My son! Help him.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.407
You have to
stop the ceremony.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.498
[growling]

14:52.674 --> 14:54.589
zap

14:56.199 --> 14:57.984
Follow my voice.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.116
Feel my presence.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.989
Join me, Lord Garmadon.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.729
[intense music]

15:04.816 --> 15:10.518
[Lord Garmadon]
'Who are you?'

15:14.609 --> 15:15.827
We have to stop her.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.133
Or maybe we should
save our friend

15:17.220 --> 15:18.526
from drowning.

15:22.182 --> 15:23.531
cling

15:23.618 --> 15:25.489
[music continues]

15:28.710 --> 15:31.104
I can't get to her.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.236
Who's gonna save Lloyd?

15:33.323 --> 15:34.237
On it.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.110
Ooh, yeah!

15:37.197 --> 15:38.111
Oh!

15:43.290 --> 15:44.900
Lloyd!

15:44.987 --> 15:46.771
[grunting]

15:46.858 --> 15:47.772
Let's get
you out of here.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.774
Don't help me,
help her.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.169
Oh, yeah.
Coming, Mrs. G.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.869
Mm-hmm,
hello again.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.393
[growling]

15:59.480 --> 16:00.785
[grunting]

16:00.872 --> 16:02.352
A little help!

16:02.439 --> 16:04.311
[grunting]

16:07.009 --> 16:08.054
Oops.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.012
[whirring]

16:12.972 --> 16:17.193
Lord Garmadon,
follow my voice.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.804
Follow the shadows.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.287
[grunting]

16:25.897 --> 16:27.029
[water splutters]

16:28.596 --> 16:30.511
[screaming]

16:32.295 --> 16:33.253
[grunts]

16:33.340 --> 16:34.558
[groans]

16:34.645 --> 16:36.996
Someone get him
out of the water.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.607
Nya, you are the Water Ninja.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.871
[grunts]
You don't need to be
a Water Ninja to do this.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.916
[grunts]

16:45.004 --> 16:47.354
[intense music]

16:47.441 --> 16:50.139
Cole, get Lloyd out.
Use your lava arm.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.230
[grunting]

16:57.625 --> 16:59.540
[rattling]

17:03.413 --> 17:05.285
[breathing heavily]

17:08.897 --> 17:10.725
Thanks.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.901
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.121
Stop her, son.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.079
[devilish laughter]

17:18.080 --> 17:19.995
[groaning]

17:24.217 --> 17:28.308
It's too fast. Maybe you can do
Spinjitzu to get inside.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.266
[wind gushing]

17:31.702 --> 17:33.574
[diabolical laugh]

17:41.582 --> 17:43.714
- That doesn't sound good.
- What's happening?

17:43.801 --> 17:47.283
You're a nindroid.
You give answers, not questions!

17:47.370 --> 17:49.111
It's him.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.070
[crackling]

17:55.291 --> 17:58.729
[Harumi]
I hear you, feel you.

17:58.816 --> 18:02.385
Come, be mortal once again.

18:02.472 --> 18:05.475
Your son wants to stop you

18:05.562 --> 18:09.436
but I want to make you stronger.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.309
[dramatic music]

18:15.529 --> 18:18.358
It is I, Harumi.

18:18.445 --> 18:19.881
Come to me.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.883
Follow my voice.

18:21.970 --> 18:28.368
[Lord Garmadon]
'Harumi?'

18:28.455 --> 18:31.545
Your time is now!

18:33.024 --> 18:34.939
[grunting]

18:39.944 --> 18:43.818
You cannot stop it.
The end is near.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.820
[whirring]

18:48.997 --> 18:51.304
Yeah!

18:56.222 --> 18:58.659
[screaming]

18:58.746 --> 19:00.269
- Jay!
- On it.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.228
[laughing]

19:03.229 --> 19:04.317
zap

19:09.670 --> 19:10.671
Ah!

19:10.758 --> 19:12.847
[Lord Garmadon screaming]

19:12.934 --> 19:13.891
No!

19:17.025 --> 19:19.027
No!

19:19.114 --> 19:21.029
[crackling]

19:28.210 --> 19:30.473
[breathing heavily]

19:30.560 --> 19:31.648
Father.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.958
Come on, boys.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.177
Let's clean the house.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.179
[clamoring]

19:55.194 --> 19:57.544
Madam,
you are under arrest.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.719
No!

19:58.806 --> 20:00.938
[groans]
Don't touch me.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.766
- We got him. We got him.
- We got him. We got him.

20:02.853 --> 20:03.811
- We got him.
- We got him.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.682
[grunting]

20:05.769 --> 20:06.901
We did it.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.903
[all cheering]

20:12.080 --> 20:15.431
I.. I'm sorry.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.303
I'm sorry
I dragged you into this.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.567
Oh, you didn't drag me
into anything.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.743
This isn't your fault.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.353
I should've known.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.833
I should've seen through her.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.445
Your only mistake is that
you're trusting and good

20:29.532 --> 20:31.839
and see the best in people.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.929
Not anymore.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.198
[instrumental music]

20:43.285 --> 20:45.200
[all cheering]

21:01.825 --> 21:04.741
Please.
You were right.

21:04.828 --> 21:07.744
- This isn't me.
- Stop.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.703
Save it
for someone who cares.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.792
It looks like
you were wrong.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.098
You weren't the one
who got away.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.100
[grunting]

21:17.232 --> 21:18.973
[engine revving]

21:19.060 --> 21:20.931
