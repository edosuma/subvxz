04:05.248 --> 04:07.040
You've never liked living with anyone but me

04:07.296 --> 04:12.672
And when you talk about wanting to start a family you mean in the future but

04:12.928 --> 04:16.255
Sometimes things happen that are planned

04:18.559 --> 04:20.351
Let me know first

04:20.607 --> 04:21.887
I was in the middle of something

04:22.399 --> 04:22.911
Trust me

06:09.919 --> 06:11.711
Guess what

06:11.967 --> 06:16.063
Temple called about the Shoemaker party next week but I will deal with them on Monday

06:16.575 --> 06:20.927
Everything is set for the event tomorrow afternoon but email me if anything comes up don't

06:21.183 --> 06:22.719
Trying to handle it yourself

06:25.279 --> 06:26.303
I'm leaving early today

06:27.071 --> 06:28.095
Early

06:29.887 --> 06:30.655
Are you okay

06:30.911 --> 06:31.679
You need to talk

06:33.471 --> 06:35.007
But probably not to unemployment

06:40.127 --> 06:46.271
Merry Christmas

06:46.527 --> 06:52.671
Even if I could make it to Sunday dinner I would bring something other than Jello mold I hate Jell-O

06:52.927 --> 06:59.071
You're the one who insisted on using the

06:59.327 --> 07:05.471
Video feature

07:05.727 --> 07:11.871
I'm not having it this year I told Jack six months ago things didn't improve I didn't see any other

07:12.127 --> 07:18.271
Solution but divorced

07:18.527 --> 07:20.575
Problems instead of letting just work themselves out

08:20.223 --> 08:25.343
Hey honey

08:25.599 --> 08:26.367
How's your day

08:52.223 --> 08:54.015
Oh yeah my day was great thanks for asking

08:54.783 --> 09:00.415
Exactly what he wants even though he knows I won't like it

09:00.927 --> 09:02.975
Why should I disable

10:05.951 --> 10:08.767
Want me to bring up anything serious

10:09.791 --> 10:15.935
I doubt your way Jack

10:22.335 --> 10:22.847
Hey

10:23.615 --> 10:26.687
Have you seen our limited edition posters new

10:26.943 --> 10:28.223
Can be worth something someday

10:30.015 --> 10:33.343
How are the push pin holes in it not to me but you knew that when you

10:35.903 --> 10:36.415
Okay

10:37.439 --> 10:38.463
Where's this coming from

10:38.975 --> 10:41.279
Even so good about not giving me a hard time lately

10:41.791 --> 10:43.071
And thank you notice

10:43.839 --> 10:45.119
Yeah I noticed a lot of things

10:45.887 --> 10:46.911
Yeah me too

10:50.495 --> 10:54.847
Okay can we skip to the part we come to an impasse about the mass because I am

10:55.103 --> 10:56.383
Really bad at cleaning

10:56.895 --> 10:59.199
Your credit sweeping things under the rug

11:00.223 --> 11:00.735
Okay

11:01.759 --> 11:03.551
You know it's been a while but here we go

11:04.063 --> 11:07.391
I think this the part where I ask how long it's been since you seen macroptera

11:07.647 --> 11:12.255
And I say that I don't like the feeling of walking in on people and they were just talking behind my back

11:12.767 --> 11:14.047
And then I say we just miss you

11:15.071 --> 11:15.583
Carolina

11:16.863 --> 11:18.911
I miss when you didn't think you were better than us

11:19.423 --> 11:23.775
Slow down on me since I turned on the New Yorker job

11:24.287 --> 11:26.079
I just want you to be happy

11:26.591 --> 11:31.711
And it seems like you're doing everything in your power to be lately

11:31.967 --> 11:38.111
You have more free time you just micromanage everything he does should have ceiling at what you can do

11:38.367 --> 11:44.511
Caroline thank you for noticing

11:44.767 --> 11:48.607
I tell you that I'm the one who wants kids remember

11:49.119 --> 11:50.655
And then you say you already have a kid

11:50.911 --> 11:57.055
Meaning me and my kids are just more toys at I won't care about when I'm done playing with them but then I remind you that I'm the one who remember to put up

11:57.311 --> 11:58.847
The tree with ornaments on it

12:01.919 --> 12:06.015
You won't let me put up a real tree by myself you're too many rules about matching

12:06.527 --> 12:07.295
Which one's goal

12:07.551 --> 12:09.599
On the front and which ones going to bottom

12:10.111 --> 12:11.647
I can't keep up

12:11.903 --> 12:13.439
If you could just

12:13.695 --> 12:15.231
Remember to sign the vet

Going to need you to come down so I can ask you some questions okay can you do that for me

14:59.327 --> 14:59.839
Sure

15:03.167 --> 15:04.703
All the time

15:09.311 --> 15:10.335
Do you know your name

15:10.591 --> 15:11.871
Caroline meets Gilbert

15:12.127 --> 15:14.175
Is that your married name

15:15.455 --> 15:18.527
I'm no I'm not married

15:19.295 --> 15:21.087
What color is this

15:21.343 --> 15:22.111
Blue and white

15:22.623 --> 15:26.207
How about your favorite flavor of ice cream

15:30.303 --> 15:36.191
I know I don't I don't know I don't even know if I have a favorite flavor of ice cream okay

15:51.551 --> 15:55.647
Your wife's prefrontal cortex

15:56.159 --> 16:00.767
Has been damaged she suffering from retrograde amnesia

16:01.279 --> 16:03.839
No she responded to her name

16:04.095 --> 16:07.423
The brain is a very complicated playing the star again

16:07.679 --> 16:12.287
Remember something and not others

16:12.543 --> 16:17.151
Could be random or her subconscious could be intentionally disassociating from

16:17.407 --> 16:18.943
Certain things

16:19.455 --> 16:21.503
I don't mean to pry

16:21.759 --> 16:23.039
But how's your marriage

16:25.855 --> 16:26.879
No marriage is perfect

16:27.135 --> 16:28.671
But we love each other

16:29.183 --> 16:29.695
Good

16:29.951 --> 16:31.487
Because this will be very stressful

16:31.743 --> 16:33.279
And she'll need your help

16:33.535 --> 16:35.839
Okay what do I do

16:36.095 --> 16:38.399
Try not to overwhelm

16:38.655 --> 16:39.935
Or pressure

16:40.191 --> 16:42.751
Resist the temptation to bring her up to speed all at once

16:43.007 --> 16:47.359
Especially unpleasant memories self

16:47.615 --> 16:49.919
So this isn't permanent

16:51.967 --> 16:52.479
It could be

16:52.991 --> 16:56.319
Or she can make a full recovery in a day

17:00.415 --> 17:01.695
I wish I had more concrete

17:01.951 --> 17:02.975
Answers for you

17:03.487 --> 17:05.022
I can say

17:05.535 --> 17:07.327
We are our memories

17:09.118 --> 17:10.398
Maybe a different person now

17:11.935 --> 17:13.727
Story of lobster

17:21.406 --> 17:22.175
Don't shoot

17:23.199 --> 17:23.711
It's me

17:24.223 --> 17:24.991
Yasmin Jack

17:26.015 --> 17:26.782
Who loves you

17:36.255 --> 17:40.351
Think you would help if we went through some pictures

17:47.263 --> 17:48.543
So here's us

17:48.799 --> 17:49.311
IParty

17:50.591 --> 17:54.431
Biscotti

17:55.711 --> 18:01.855
Call Scotty

18:04.159 --> 18:05.439
I want to be a married

18:05.951 --> 18:10.559
4 years on New Year's Day

18:11.071 --> 18:13.375
Ironically because you

18:13.631 --> 18:16.447
Thought that day would be easy to remember

18:20.799 --> 18:22.079
I just I don't know

18:22.335 --> 18:24.127
If I have parents or

18:24.639 --> 18:27.711
Friends or kids or Jack Frost

18:27.967 --> 18:31.551
I don't even know if I have a favorite flavor of ice cream

18:33.343 --> 18:34.111
You're not supposed to get

18:34.367 --> 18:36.159
What's up maybe I should just go

18:41.279 --> 18:44.095
Wait

18:44.863 --> 18:48.959
You're married

18:49.215 --> 18:50.751
Not wearing a wedding ring

18:53.567 --> 18:57.919
But you took it to you clean

18:58.175 --> 19:03.295
I still have mine never take it off

19:09.183 --> 19:10.463
I'm sorry I don't know you

19:13.791 --> 19:14.303
And how are you

19:18.399 --> 19:19.423
Rocky Road

19:20.703 --> 19:26.847
Your favorite flavor ice cream

19:29.407 --> 19:31.199
I'll be on here

19:31.455 --> 19:37.343
Jack

19:39.903 --> 19:40.415
Jack

19:40.927 --> 19:43.999
How's my baby

19:45.279 --> 19:46.047
Your babies

19:46.303 --> 19:47.071
Got amnesia

19:47.327 --> 19:47.839
What

19:48.863 --> 19:50.655
Yeah so far she only remembers her name

19:51.935 --> 19:53.215
I don't believe it

19:53.471 --> 19:59.615
I mean she's got to be just trying to teach us some kind of spiteful lesson or something on your mother-in-law

19:59.871 --> 20:02.431
I don't think the doctors really teaches a lesson Peg

20:02.943 --> 20:06.527
NEC not to Riley Route by making a remember anything stress

20:07.295 --> 20:10.111
Bills are politics know about the divorce papers Jack

20:10.623 --> 20:11.647
I'm assuming she doesn't

20:13.183 --> 20:18.559
What she doesn't have to do she was about to make a huge mistake

20:19.071 --> 20:22.911
Dodgers probably right shouldn't tell her everything just yet

20:23.423 --> 20:25.471
Don't trust anyone

20:26.239 --> 20:32.383
So only happy memories passes door

20:43.647 --> 20:44.927
Scottie Pippen boy

20:45.183 --> 20:47.743
Yeah

20:47.999 --> 20:48.767
Boy

20:50.303 --> 20:52.607
I'm glad somebody remembers who loves me

20:53.887 --> 20:54.399
Yeah

20:59.007 --> 21:00.799
I have to pick who to go home with

21:01.567 --> 21:03.871
You have multiple loved ones who want to care for you

21:04.383 --> 21:07.199
Play the doctor aren't you supposed to tell me what's best

21:07.455 --> 21:08.479
You know you got

21:09.247 --> 21:10.527
Thank you could live alone

21:11.039 --> 21:11.807
Your choice

21:17.440 --> 21:18.464
No I can't

21:18.720 --> 21:20.768
Live with my parents forever

21:21.280 --> 21:25.120
I don't want the life I chose

21:27.168 --> 21:31.008
Sweet

21:32.032 --> 21:37.408
She chose to go home with me I mean that's gotta mean something right

21:37.664 --> 21:38.688
Misha's got amnesia

21:39.968 --> 21:40.992
She was in love with me

21:41.248 --> 21:46.624
Okay and I never stop seeing the fun warm strong surprising woman inside that I fell in love with him

21:47.136 --> 21:47.904
I still love her

21:52.768 --> 21:54.560
I'm sure she didn't want to divorce

21:54.816 --> 21:56.864
I'm sure she just wanted to get jacks attention

21:57.376 --> 21:59.168
And trust me she's gotten it

21:59.424 --> 22:02.752
You know you've done the right thing by following the doctor's orders to the T

22:03.008 --> 22:04.032
You spared her

22:04.288 --> 22:05.568
Stress unhappiness

22:06.080 --> 22:08.384
Which is exactly why I've told her

22:08.896 --> 22:09.920
She does not have a job

22:10.432 --> 22:11.456
You did what

22:12.992 --> 22:15.808
All of her problems revolved around that job

22:16.320 --> 22:18.368
She needed a break before this happened

22:18.880 --> 22:20.672
She definitely needs one now

22:21.184 --> 22:23.744
She got a husband who didn't tell her she's divorcing it

22:24.000 --> 22:27.328
Seattle motherhood until she runs a company the dad

22:28.096 --> 22:29.888
Lucy's no better option

22:30.144 --> 22:34.752
For the week your way and then we'll reassess

22:47.808 --> 22:53.952
Take your time

22:54.208 --> 23:00.352
This is what about you

23:06.240 --> 23:08.544
Dj scotty boy

23:08.800 --> 23:13.664
Mom told me she was coming home

23:13.920 --> 23:16.736
I feel the same way

23:16.992 --> 23:18.784
He seems undisciplined

23:19.040 --> 23:21.856
Non groomed dogs

23:22.112 --> 23:23.136
Should be dogs

23:24.928 --> 23:26.464
Home sweet home

23:30.304 --> 23:32.864

Amore by canceling

But these led candles

52:02.431 --> 52:02.943

53:05.919 --> 53:07.199
Industrious review

53:10.271 --> 53:11.551
If I go to bed early

53:12.063 --> 53:14.367

Loved ones

53:43.295 --> 53:46.623
You can crash my place if you want

53:46.879 --> 53:49.951
But I'm going to have to face them eventually

53:50.207 --> 53:52.511
I can't keep this act up another week

53:56.863 --> 54:00.447
Amazing seriously even with half a memory

54:01.727 --> 54:04.799
If you love me why wouldn't they want me to know that

54:06.847 --> 54:08.895
Well

54:09.151 --> 54:11.199
What

54:11.455 --> 54:15.807
I can't fire you my business would go under without you

54:16.319 --> 54:19.135
You used to be

54:19.391 --> 54:21.695
Different ear maybe you were home too

54:22.719 --> 54:23.743
Different how

54:27.327 --> 54:29.631
Wescom

54:31.167 --> 54:31.935
Trusting

54:32.703 --> 54:34.751
Maybe it's nothing but

54:35.007 --> 54:38.335
Endive your accident UF early for

54:39.359 --> 54:40.127
The first time

54:40.383 --> 54:41.663
You were upset

54:42.175 --> 54:43.967
And I don't think it was about work

54:45.759 --> 54:47.295
But you wouldn't have told me right away

54:48.063 --> 54:51.903
I held you back the way they hold me back

54:53.183 --> 54:53.695
No

54:54.207 --> 54:58.303
I know I wasn't always so good at this I learned by watching you

55:03.167 --> 55:09.311
Enough holding back

55:22.623 --> 55:28.511
Didn't want me to know I was a winner that's the big bad Secret

55:30.047 --> 55:35.423
Peg you are so

55:35.679 --> 55:39.263
Boston

55:43.103 --> 55:45.407
Hi honey what are you doing here

55:46.687 --> 55:48.991
Is there any

55:49.759 --> 55:50.783
In the kitchen

55:52.063 --> 55:56.927
Is that your yearbook got the axe mom if you even really are my mother

55:57.439 --> 55:57.951
Porcine

55:58.463 --> 56:02.815
Even telling you Little White Lies for almost 30 years to spare you paid

56:03.583 --> 56:05.375
I get a free pass

56:05.631 --> 56:07.167
You don't get the part in yourself

56:07.423 --> 56:08.191
My specialty

56:09.215 --> 56:11.775
Our daughter apparently has never heard the term

56:12.031 --> 56:12.799
Blissfully ignorant

56:14.079 --> 56:17.151
I'm calling it back. Does not make it not melted ice cream

56:17.407 --> 56:18.687
He's being willfully ignorant

56:18.943 --> 56:19.455
You're special

56:22.783 --> 56:23.807
I'm going to go wash some

56:27.135 --> 56:30.719
What is so evil about planning parties being good at things

56:32.767 --> 56:35.327
Hardly ever saw you anymore

56:35.583 --> 56:40.191
Not only did you always on your phone could make it to my retirement party

56:40.703 --> 56:43.519
Stop doing Sunday dinners

56:43.775 --> 56:45.567
Always irritable

56:45.823 --> 56:47.871
I can like whatever you had going on with

56:48.127 --> 56:50.687
Crucial what everyone else had to go in August trivia

56:51.711 --> 56:53.759
Returning a business

56:54.015 --> 56:56.063
Things are life and death

56:56.575 --> 56:58.367
What about Terry's mom's funeral

56:58.879 --> 57:01.951
She also skipped

57:02.463 --> 57:08.607
Problem is running a business because I've done that and it's not you succeeding me Steve

57:08.863 --> 57:12.959
Don't let your whole life no one knows what caused the problem

57:13.215 --> 57:16.543
But it's all wrapped around your work and we can separate the two

57:16.799 --> 57:22.431
Can you blame us for being as in to bring that back

57:25.759 --> 57:28.063
For then and now

57:34.463 --> 57:40.607
Siri

57:44.703 --> 57:50.847
What are you doing

57:51.103 --> 57:57.247
Cold out there

57:57.503 --> 58:02.879
My dad told me I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you for your mom's funeral

58:04.159 --> 58:05.695
I'm so sorry to hear

58:16.703 --> 58:18.239
I don't understand

58:23.615 --> 58:25.407
What time is it

58:28.735 --> 58:31.039
I don't feel that way anymore if

58:31.807 --> 58:32.831
Anything

58:33.343 --> 58:34.367
I'm jealous

58:36.927 --> 58:39.487
I want kids but I want a job to

58:41.023 --> 58:42.303
I ask you something

58:43.583 --> 58:44.607
Do I seem like

58:45.119 --> 58:45.631
Me

58:46.143 --> 58:51.775
I don't want to be the person I was before but

58:52.031 --> 58:56.383
I'm pretty okay with the me right now

58:56.895 --> 58:57.919
Call 404

59:00.735 --> 59:03.295
Trial of Jack and the good before

59:05.343 --> 59:07.903
I remember every guy you have ever dated

59:08.671 --> 59:09.951
Principle matches all

59:19.167 --> 59:25.311
Why do I dread going home

59:25.567 --> 59:30.687
The minute I saw him in the hospital and I can tell he cares and I love

59:30.943 --> 59:32.991
Denny's Carefree videos also

59:33.247 --> 59:34.271
Really

59:36.575 --> 59:38.111
Exactly I mean

59:39.135 --> 59:42.207
He doesn't take care of anything things he values

59:42.463 --> 59:48.607
Bukti values he sets wet glasses on he loves the dog and he forgets to walk him it's like

59:49.119 --> 59:50.399
I bet Jack

59:51.167 --> 59:53.471
Was really fun to fall in love with

59:53.983 --> 59:55.775
Please not fun to live with

59:56.031 --> 01:00:02.175
Hugh Jackman

01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:07.807
Not ours and he's resistant to change the future is all I have now

01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:12.159
Jack deserves a wife not a roommate

01:00:13.951 --> 01:00:15.999
I have to move out

01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:34.687
Guys I still heard Carolyn say she wants to move out

01:00:35.455 --> 01:00:36.479
Would you want to do that

01:00:36.991 --> 01:00:37.759
Levi

01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:40.831
If you divorce I may never have grandchildren

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:42.879
If she's not happy

01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:45.951
How many Second Chances do you expect check

01:00:46.463 --> 01:00:47.487
Or tomorrow

01:00:47.999 --> 01:00:49.279
Perfect in the beginning

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:51.071
I was just trying to protect that

01:00:52.351 --> 01:00:53.375
You tried it your way

01:00:54.143 --> 01:00:55.423
Over and over

01:00:56.191 --> 01:00:56.959
It doesn't work

01:00:57.471 --> 01:00:58.751
Try it her way

01:01:17.695 --> 01:01:20.255
Did somebody's phone ring.

01:01:21.791 --> 01:01:23.327
Why is it cold in here

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.119
The front door open

01:01:26.655 --> 01:01:27.935
Breezy

01:01:28.703 --> 01:01:29.215
Jack

01:01:31.007 --> 01:01:31.519
Jack

01:01:40.223 --> 01:01:42.015
Hey

01:01:42.271 --> 01:01:43.807
What are you doing calling from your phone

01:01:44.063 --> 01:01:45.855
Check you know I know and I know you know

01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:48.927
Okay look just so we're clear

01:01:50.975 --> 01:01:53.279
And I know you've been hiding my company from me

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:55.071
And I know why

01:01:56.607 --> 01:01:57.375
I forgive you

01:01:58.143 --> 01:02:00.191
But I want to stay at my Folk's place this weekend

01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:07.103
And I coming home

01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:07.871
Monday night

01:03:15.967 --> 01:03:18.527
I talked to Dante

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:20.831
And they said he tried Caroline's my butt

01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:22.623
I don't even know what that is

01:03:24.415 --> 01:03:25.951
I blew it back then

01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:28.255
A good past two weeks

01:03:28.767 --> 01:03:34.655
Smart money says upload again on Monday why are you being so defeatist and self-sabotage man

01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:36.191
Okay

01:03:37.215 --> 01:03:41.311
Carolyn got in the accident she was on her way drop-off sign divorce papers

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:44.895
You sign me into signing them

01:03:45.407 --> 01:03:49.759
No wonder you've been acting so weird I am trying to fix things with her and I'm

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:51.039
Freaking out

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.087
Guys I'm confused I'm hurt

01:03:53.599 --> 01:03:54.879
With everything on the line

01:03:56.927 --> 01:04:03.071
Has she ever mentioned the d-word before I just thought it was for shock value but she has given up on me

01:04:03.327 --> 01:04:07.679
She didn't even want to discuss fixing it I mean she clearly doesn't even think I'm capable of fixing it

01:04:07.935 --> 01:04:10.495
I tried to recreate

01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:15.359
Darling days so that we fall in love like we did before and it doesn't even feel like

01:04:15.871 --> 01:04:16.895
It did before to me

01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:19.711
Because it's not the same as it was back

01:04:19.967 --> 01:04:20.991
Nothing is

01:04:21.759 --> 01:04:23.039
Things change

01:04:25.087 --> 01:04:29.951
See not enough for her to forget right

01:04:30.207 --> 01:04:31.487
So you have to forget to

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:34.559
Remember that

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:38.143
Remember to forget

01:06:12.607 --> 01:06:18.751
The right place my gosh I guess so is your name

01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:25.151
Welcome home

01:06:26.431 --> 01:06:27.711
Be kidding me

01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:30.015
The place looks amazing

01:06:30.783 --> 01:06:36.927
Mr. Awesome

01:06:37.183 --> 01:06:43.327
It goes by the dumpsters occurred to me that this place bore a striking resemblance

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:47.935
You cooked you can cook

01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:54.079
How long can a closet fan of cooking shows with a Middle Fork for once

01:06:55.103 --> 01:06:57.151
Wow how can I turn that down

01:06:57.663 --> 01:06:59.455
North Carolina I'm sorry

01:06:59.967 --> 01:07:06.111
I've always heard that your soulmate love you at your worst and I took that way too literally

01:07:06.367 --> 01:07:09.695
For believing that we were so security have to try

01:07:10.719 --> 01:07:15.071
Maybe you didn't have to before so I should have always been given you my best

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.375
You deserve it

01:07:25.823 --> 01:07:30.175
How many Adventures can one dinosaur go on

01:07:30.943 --> 01:07:32.223
Which like this song

01:07:32.735 --> 01:07:34.015
Do large black butt

01:07:34.783 --> 01:07:36.063
I'm trying not to think about it

01:07:37.855 --> 01:07:40.927
Well how did you think of to begin with

01:07:42.463 --> 01:07:43.999
Trying to meet you

01:07:45.279 --> 01:07:46.303
Make an impression

01:07:47.071 --> 01:07:49.631
Has your buggy on a bunch of balloons

We got over it

01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:43.487
It makes it worse

01:15:43.743 --> 01:15:47.071
So we were having this week because now I can't trust happiness with you

01:15:48.095 --> 01:15:54.239
You can't keep doing this or we're going to keep ending up here and you can't even tell me why

01:15:57.567 --> 01:15:58.079
Okay

01:15:58.847 --> 01:16:04.223

01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:07.295
You don't have those

01:16:08.575 --> 01:16:09.343
And meet me

01:16:09.855 --> 01:16:12.927
Resent your work which is crazy because I was your biggest supporter

01:16:15.487 --> 01:16:19.839
And it just made you nitpick a little things because I wouldn't discuss the big things with you

01:16:21.887 --> 01:16:25.215
He just wanted everything to be easy

01:16:25.727 --> 01:16:30.079
Capizzi's all I cared about this relationship is the last place that I would be alright

01:16:31.615 --> 01:16:37.247
But I did think that if it took work and we weren't the written in the stars couple that I thought we were in

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.807
And that I can lose you

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:41.855

01:16:42.111 --> 01:16:46.463

01:16:48.511 --> 01:16:50.303

01:17:06.175 --> 01:17:12.319

And why are people coming to our party

01:18:08.127 --> 01:18:11.711
If they knew as well enough they probably knew that we were on the verge of divorce

01:18:12.991 --> 01:18:16.063
To be to see the best in people in diapers

01:18:17.087 --> 01:18:19.135

01:18:19.647 --> 01:18:20.927
But he never gives up

01:18:21.695 --> 01:18:24.511
