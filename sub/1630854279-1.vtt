Well, joke's on you,
randal, because
there's only one god.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.737
Yeah. What about Thor?
Thor's a god.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.673
Thor is a fictional
character who flies

08:59.773 --> 09:00.941
So is your god.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.242
Mr. Dante.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.782
His god is the living

09:03.877 --> 09:05.112
His god is the living dead

10:02.269 --> 10:04.671
Maybe we can sell some online.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.073

10:06.173 --> 10:07.641
The only way anyone

10:07.741 --> 10:09.409
would care about
this old-timey bullshit

10:09.510 --> 10:11.445
is if you shot

10:11.545 --> 10:14.615

Christian dickhole.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.452
Asshole.
Thank you.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.263
You know what, randal?
I don't think
there's anything

10:20.287 --> 10:22.456
particularly "metal"
about blasphemy.

10:22.556 --> 10:26.026
Shah, blasphemy
and biting off
a bat's head

10:26.126 --> 10:28.028
are as metal as it gets.

10:29.998 --> 10:32.199
There were two men
who were crucified
with Jesus, randal.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.867
Holy fuck.

10:33.968 --> 10:36.203
A good thief and a bad thief.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.538
If they were caught, I'd say

10:37.638 --> 10:39.072
that makes them both
bad thieves.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.841
The bad thief said,

10:40.942 --> 10:43.210
"if you are really
the son of god,

10:43.310 --> 10:45.812
"get us down from here
and save us."

10:45.914 --> 10:47.848
So why is this
guy called
"the bad thief"?

10:47.949 --> 10:50.584
Call him "the practical
thief with common
fucking sense."

10:50.684 --> 10:53.353
Ah. But the good
thief said,

10:53.453 --> 10:57.926
"Jesus did no wrong,
whereas we are but thieves."

10:58.026 --> 11:00.193
What the fuck are butt thieves?

11:00.294 --> 11:03.063
Uh, well,
then the good
thief said,

11:03.163 --> 11:05.432
"Jesus, remember me
in your kingdom."

11:05.532 --> 11:07.334
And Jesus said
to the good thief,

11:07.434 --> 11:10.103
"today, you shall be
with me in paradise."

11:10.203 --> 11:12.339
And paradise is a strip club.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.541
It's not a strip club, randal.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.644
It's heaven.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.981
So the moral of your
never ending story is,

11:20.080 --> 11:22.649
even in heaven,
it's all about
who you know.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.152
The moral of the story

11:25.252 --> 11:27.287
is if you didn't
go to heaven
as a guest of Jesus,

11:27.387 --> 11:28.555
like the good thief,

11:28.655 --> 11:30.457
where did the bad
thief go, randal?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.492
Not that I wanna
prolong your sermon,

11:32.593 --> 11:34.996
but how is it
blasphemy
to remind a guy

11:35.095 --> 11:36.463
he's the son of god?

11:36.563 --> 11:38.332
Maybe the bad thief thought

11:38.432 --> 11:40.072
<i>Jesus had
a bourne identity
thing going on,</i>

11:40.133 --> 11:41.368
like Jesus fell off a boat,

11:41.468 --> 11:43.236
hit his head and caught amnesia.

11:43.337 --> 11:45.272
He was born in a manger.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.041
Now he's bourne again.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.477
Matt Damon is Jesus bourne in...

11:50.577 --> 11:52.546
The bourne nativity.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.448
Heavenly father, I beseech thee,

11:54.548 --> 11:56.883

11:57.919 --> 11:59.653
Oh.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.024

12:03.123 --> 12:05.994
No, something's wrong, I...
I can't catch my breath.

12:06.094 --> 12:07.127
Stop teasing me.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.463
I'm not teasing, I...

12:09.563 --> 12:11.298
I can't catch my breath, man.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.934

12:15.168 --> 12:16.570

12:16.670 --> 12:19.040

12:19.139 --> 12:20.240

You're really sweating, randal.

12:25.046 --> 12:26.313
It's hot in here, man.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.915
Can we open the door?
I got to...

12:29.783 --> 12:30.918
Mr. Dante!

12:31.852 --> 12:33.487
Oh, shit!

12:33.587 --> 12:35.756
I need an ambulance
at the quickstop.

12:39.493 --> 12:40.995
<i>Dr. Ladenheim,</i>

12:41.095 --> 12:42.696
<i>report to the er.</i>

12:42.796 --> 12:44.331
<i>Dr. Ladenheim...</i>

12:44.431 --> 12:46.067
You had to call
an ambulance,
didn't you?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.903
I just ate too much
fuckin' mooby's,
that's all.

12:49.003 --> 12:51.171
Well, if you know what's wrong,

12:51.271 --> 12:52.839
then I guess I can go home.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.341
Are you the doctor?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.943
I'm the doctor.

12:56.044 --> 12:58.079
Dr. Ladenheim, I'll be
your savior this evening.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.084
What in the fuck?

13:03.183 --> 13:04.484
I apologize for my wardrobe.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.286
I just came from a costume ball.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.555
Listen, doc,
I'm okay. I just...

13:08.655 --> 13:10.524
I can't catch my breath is all.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.225
On a scale of one to ten,

13:12.325 --> 13:13.469
how bad would you say
your pain level is?

13:13.493 --> 13:14.361
My pain level?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.796
Like a negative three.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.431
Well, you're doing it all wrong.

13:17.531 --> 13:18.808
You're supposed to be
in a lot of pain

13:18.832 --> 13:20.434
when you have a heart attack.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.170
Wait a minute.
I had a heart attack?

13:22.269 --> 13:23.637
No, that's not what I said.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.257
You misunderstood me.
Oh, thank Christ.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.425
You're having a heart attack

13:26.473 --> 13:28.308
right now as we speak,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.844
a massive one,
so we have to act
pretty quickly.

13:30.945 --> 13:33.014
I just wish
I wasn't
so hung over.

13:33.114 --> 13:35.049
I'm kidding.

13:35.149 --> 13:36.817
I'm gonna go get all glammed up

13:36.918 --> 13:38.494
for our big date
and I'll see you
in the or.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.886
Look at me.
Uh-huh.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.364
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.456
Good. All right.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.324
He's not gonna make it.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.560
<i>Jesus, could someone
page the good witch?</i>

13:46.660 --> 13:48.695
What's next, a fucking munchkin?

13:48.795 --> 13:52.033
Shave and a haircut two bits.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.768
Shave and a haircut two bits.

13:56.037 --> 13:57.939
I see that you met
Dr. Ladenheim.

13:58.039 --> 14:01.943
And she wants me to
prep you for surgery.

14:02.043 --> 14:05.512
Surgery? No.
The doctor just said
I'm going to the or.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.748
Right! Which is short
for operating room

14:07.848 --> 14:10.684
where they do...
Ding, ding, ding,
surgery!

14:10.784 --> 14:12.552
She gotta get into your heart.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.588
Uh, is the doctor
gonna crack
his chest open?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.590
Fuck.
No, no, no.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.367
She's gonna thread
a camera through
his femoral artery

14:18.391 --> 14:20.827
up to his ticker
through a very
small incision.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.896
Where does
she make this incision?

14:22.997 --> 14:23.997
In the groin.

14:24.065 --> 14:25.766
The groin?
Come on.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.400
So I gotta shave you.

14:27.501 --> 14:29.103
Or I get to shave you,

14:29.203 --> 14:31.939
depending on how much
you love your job
and I love mine.

14:32.039 --> 14:35.842
<i>So, as the wife
says at 10:00 P.M.
after dateline,</i>

14:35.943 --> 14:37.344
every single week,

14:38.246 --> 14:39.846
take off your pants.

14:48.923 --> 14:52.459
I gotta shave
your groin, sir,
so underwear too.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.661
First, can we
establish geography?

14:54.761 --> 14:56.596
Like, where is the groin to you?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.299
Where's the groin to me?

14:59.399 --> 15:00.968
What is this,
a metaphysical question?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.204
We're running
out of time here
to save your life.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.304
So come on, let's go.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.341
Can you avert
your eyes,
block your ears

15:08.441 --> 15:09.977
and sing something, please?

15:10.077 --> 15:12.280
Oh, for god sakes.
What do you
want me to sing?

15:12.379 --> 15:13.713
Not you, him.
Oh, right.

15:13.814 --> 15:15.482
All right, here's the deal,

15:15.582 --> 15:16.117
<i>nurse Jackie.</i>

15:16.217 --> 15:17.651
Mmm.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.686
I got a really small dick, okay?

15:19.786 --> 15:22.756
I promise you,
it's nothing
I've not seen before

15:22.856 --> 15:25.226
because I work in pediatrics.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.793
If I take off my underwear,

15:26.893 --> 15:29.230
everyone in the er is
gonna see my little dick

15:29.329 --> 15:30.932
including my friend here,

15:31.032 --> 15:32.775
who thinks I got
a giant cock 'cause
I've been lying to him

15:32.799 --> 15:34.701
about it since we were 12.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.636
Is this a long fable, aesop?

15:36.736 --> 15:37.948
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,

15:37.972 --> 15:39.974
give you a little
more privacy...

15:40.074 --> 15:42.109
There you go.
Oh, thanks for that.

15:43.978 --> 15:45.947
Unfortunately,
this is as far
as you can go

15:46.047 --> 15:49.116
but we do have a waiting
room that's right
down this hall.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.419
I'll be right here
when you get out, man.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.588
You got this.

16:04.932 --> 16:09.502
<i>♪ You got an idea
we can rock the night</i>

16:09.603 --> 16:11.504
we've got a female with multiple

16:11.605 --> 16:13.207
c-spine complications,
internal bleeding

16:13.307 --> 16:14.541
and multiple lacerations.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.911
Blood pressure,
100 over seven...

16:17.011 --> 16:20.614
<i>♪ Let's both make a promise
that we can't say... ♪</i>

16:22.016 --> 16:24.185
- We're losing her.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.128
Why has he still

16:34.228 --> 16:35.829
got his underpants on?

16:35.930 --> 16:38.232
How am I supposed
to get to his
femoral artery

16:38.332 --> 16:39.733
if he's wearing squeezies?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.335
I told him,

16:41.434 --> 16:42.745
but he's got some
body shame issues.

16:42.769 --> 16:43.905
Look, doc,

16:44.005 --> 16:45.373
I got a really small dick.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.974
I'm trying to save your life

16:47.074 --> 16:48.517
and you're worried
about your
little dick?

16:48.541 --> 16:49.210
We don't have time for this.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.677
Whoa!

16:50.777 --> 16:54.447
This is all my fault.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.516
No, it is not, Elias.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.853
I prayed to god to smite randal

16:59.954 --> 17:04.292
so Jesus
attacked his heart
at my command.

17:05.993 --> 17:08.428
Randal's mother
had heart
trouble, too.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.399
No,
I gotta make
Jesus reverse this.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.267
Pray with me,
Mr. Dante.

17:15.036 --> 17:19.506
Oh, my sweet savior,
hear your
gentle servant.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.609
Spare the heretic
I damned in jest.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.478
Remember the words
of the good thief.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.747
Jesus did no wrong,

17:27.847 --> 17:31.018
whereas we are but thieves.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.854
A-ha.
What's up, doc?

17:34.956 --> 17:37.557
I can tell by your
very subtle tattoo

17:37.657 --> 17:38.825
that you're a superhero fan,

17:38.926 --> 17:40.328
so you might appreciate this.

17:40.428 --> 17:41.628
Uh-huh.
You know,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.230
they have a name for the type

17:43.331 --> 17:44.507
of heart attack
you're having
right now.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.933
Really? Okay.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.935
They call it the widow-maker.

17:48.035 --> 17:50.104
Now, doesn't
that sound like
some bad guy

17:50.204 --> 17:52.505
<i>that ranger danger has to fight?</i>

17:52.605 --> 17:54.674
Why do they call it
the widow-maker?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.476
Because in 80% of the cases

17:56.576 --> 17:59.113
when there's 100%
occlusion like what
you have now?

17:59.213 --> 18:02.283
Hands down,
patient always
dies, always.

18:02.383 --> 18:03.918
Oh, fuck.

18:04.018 --> 18:05.752
But don't worry,
you're gonna
be in the 20%

18:05.852 --> 18:08.289
because keeping
you alive is good
for my brand.

18:08.389 --> 18:10.024
Now, if you excuse me,

18:10.124 --> 18:12.259
I'm gonna go fool around
in your little crotch

18:12.360 --> 18:13.928
and I'm gonna make
a little magic,

18:14.028 --> 18:15.997
but I could use
all the help
that we can get.

18:16.097 --> 18:17.630
So, if you remember any prayers

18:17.731 --> 18:19.532
from when you were a kid,

18:19.632 --> 18:21.432
now would be
a terrific time
to dust those off.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.206
Are you there, crom?

18:25.306 --> 18:26.974
It's me, randal.

18:27.074 --> 18:29.243
<i>Please don't let me die.</i>

18:31.578 --> 18:32.980
He won't answer me.

18:35.416 --> 18:37.018
After all this time...

18:37.952 --> 18:40.653
Devoting my life to god.

18:40.754 --> 18:44.025
Jesus has abandoned
all of us at quickstop.

18:44.125 --> 18:47.328
I think Jesus
was always more
of a wawa guy.

18:47.428 --> 18:50.897
Yeah, well,
you know what I think?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.635
I think I wasted
my life believing
in bullshit.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.138
I've been conned.

18:57.238 --> 19:00.274
Fairy tales, faith
and pledging fealty

19:00.374 --> 19:04.145
to a fictional
fucking phantom.
And for what?

19:04.245 --> 19:06.313
In my darkest hour
when I need him most,

19:06.414 --> 19:08.983
the lord totally ghosts me.

19:11.085 --> 19:14.554
Well, to hell
with all that
made up Jesus jive.

19:17.391 --> 19:20.560
Save randal this night,

19:20.660 --> 19:23.130
and I will swear my soul to you,

19:23.763 --> 19:26.167
oh, sweet Satan.

19:26.267 --> 19:27.834
Satan? Oh,
buddy, no.

19:27.935 --> 19:31.604
I mean, isn't he kind
of like the optimus
prime of evil?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.573
You don't have to
condescend to me.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.342
You can just say Megatron.

19:35.443 --> 19:37.978
<i>I'm kind of
a transformers virgin.</i>

19:38.611 --> 19:40.381
Well,

19:40.481 --> 19:42.249
I'm an actual virgin,

19:42.349 --> 19:44.617
so I know Satan's
gonna want my soul.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.154
For what?
Evil.

19:48.522 --> 19:51.092
And butt sex probably.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.229
Do you have any lube?
Are you...

19:55.329 --> 19:56.663
No!

19:56.763 --> 19:58.765
I don't deserve lube!

19:58.865 --> 20:00.700
Take me, Satan!

20:00.800 --> 20:02.169
Jesus! Pull up
your pants.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.904
Make me
your concubine!
Jesus...

20:04.004 --> 20:05.406
Pull up your pants.
No, stop it.

20:05.506 --> 20:06.941
I have to fuck Satan.

20:07.041 --> 20:10.511
And that's when, I shit you not,

20:10.610 --> 20:13.746
Luke fuckin' Skywalker shows up.

20:13.847 --> 20:15.349
Uh-huh.
And I'm talking about

20:15.449 --> 20:18.385
<i>the young, fuckable Luke
from return of the jedi,</i>

20:18.486 --> 20:21.122
<i>not the gran Torino,

20:21.222 --> 20:23.790
<i>- Luke from the last jedi.
- Okay.</i>

20:23.890 --> 20:25.658
Quick heart update,
Mr. Graves.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.727
Uh-huh.
During your thorough

20:27.827 --> 20:29.497
<i>retelling of
the star wars show...</i>

20:29.597 --> 20:31.198
<i>The Mandalorian, season two.</i>

20:31.298 --> 20:33.134
I was able to get
the stent in place.

20:33.234 --> 20:34.935
So this is where
I need your help now.

20:35.035 --> 20:36.779
I'm gonna open this stent
and all you have to do

20:36.803 --> 20:38.105
is tell me when you feel

20:38.205 --> 20:39.907
the pressure lets up.
All right?

20:40.007 --> 20:41.808
Let's do this, mcdreamy.

20:41.909 --> 20:43.444
"This is the way."

20:43.544 --> 20:44.979
The way to what?

20:45.079 --> 20:47.615
<i>Oh, that's a saying
from the Mandalorian.</i>

20:47.714 --> 20:50.117
<i>Huh?
The star wars show.</i>

20:50.217 --> 20:51.919
Okay, listen,
we need to hit pause

20:52.019 --> 20:53.796
on all your pop culture
references for a minute

20:53.820 --> 20:56.490
just until we open
the stent on three.

20:56.590 --> 20:59.226
One, two, three!

20:59.726 --> 21:00.961
Oh!

21:01.061 --> 21:05.132
Holy shit, I can
fucking breathe again.

21:05.232 --> 21:06.967
Does this mean
I'm gonna live now?

21:07.067 --> 21:09.103
Yes, because
I'm an amazing doctor.

21:09.203 --> 21:12.006
You're a better doctor
than doctor strange

21:12.106 --> 21:15.109
and doctor zaius
combined.
Doctor who?

21:15.209 --> 21:17.077
Oh, no, I don't watch that show,

21:17.178 --> 21:21.115
but I might start now
because I'm fucking alive.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.585
<i>"Mazel tov!"
As the Chinese say.</i>

21:24.684 --> 21:25.920
Thank you, doctor.

21:26.020 --> 21:28.389
Thank you for saving my life.

21:28.489 --> 21:31.358
You're like the Batman
of heart surgery.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.792
Yeah?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.061
With great power

21:34.161 --> 21:35.462
comes great responsibility.

21:35.563 --> 21:37.164
What the fuck was that?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.336
- You're alive!
- You're alive!

21:42.436 --> 21:44.737
Are you okay?
If that was
a heart attack,

21:44.837 --> 21:47.942
I'll take another one.
That shit was easy.

21:48.042 --> 21:50.843
Okay, you must be
on a lot of drugs
right now.

21:50.945 --> 21:52.879
No, they didn't
give me
nothing in there.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.548
I had to do
the whole
thing sober.

21:54.648 --> 21:57.451
He's high as a kite on fentanyl.

21:57.551 --> 22:00.087
Kite imagery, very cool.

22:00.187 --> 22:02.755
See, randal,
kites are in the air.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.325
Stop with the fucking kites.

22:04.425 --> 22:05.926
One more thing,
Mr. Graves,

22:06.026 --> 22:08.895
since you were really
preoccupied about it,

22:08.996 --> 22:13.167
so much so that
you wasted time
and nearly died,

22:13.267 --> 22:15.102
your penis is not that small.

22:15.202 --> 22:17.304
It's not that big,
but it's not that small.

22:17.404 --> 22:20.341
That's the best
news I heard all day.

22:25.012 --> 22:26.447
Is he gonna be okay?

22:26.547 --> 22:27.715
How do I help?

22:27.814 --> 22:29.149
Well, if you care about him,

22:29.250 --> 22:31.218
you'll jam a vegetable
down his throat.

22:31.318 --> 22:33.721
The guy's got more
cholesterol in his
arteries than blood.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.257
Got it. From now on,
I'm only gonna
order him food

22:36.357 --> 22:37.857
off the vegan menu at mooby's.

22:37.958 --> 22:39.693
Him and you.
Me?

22:39.792 --> 22:40.995
If you're around his age

22:41.095 --> 22:42.795
and eat the same diet
as your friend,

22:42.895 --> 22:44.864
you might wanna get
your heart checked out, too.

22:44.965 --> 22:46.667
Will do.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.144
But here's something
I want you to keep

22:48.168 --> 22:50.137
an eye out for
as regards to randal.

22:50.237 --> 22:51.405
Okay.

22:51.505 --> 22:53.741
Middle-aged men tend to
go through a depression

22:53.840 --> 22:55.442
after they've had
a heart attack.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.554
Now your friend might
sound or act differently
now because

22:57.578 --> 23:00.047
he's come face to face
with his own mortality.

23:00.147 --> 23:02.616
So, for the next few months,

23:02.716 --> 23:04.718
do whatever you can do

23:04.817 --> 23:07.787
to help randal
keep his spirits up.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.089
All right?

23:09.189 --> 23:11.392
Now, my bill is in the mail.

23:16.196 --> 23:17.797
Judgy.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.233
<i>♪ Whatever it takes</i>

23:21.101 --> 23:23.270
<i>♪ I know I can make it</i>

23:25.472 --> 23:27.941
<i>♪ I know
I can make it through</i>

23:33.747 --> 23:35.582
I brought you a hat.

23:35.683 --> 23:37.151
Yeah. Thanks.

23:38.786 --> 23:39.996
I can't believe
you're still awake

23:40.020 --> 23:41.388
after the day
you've been through.

23:41.488 --> 23:44.325
Yeah, I can't sleep.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.294
There was only a 20% chance

23:47.394 --> 23:50.597
I was gonna make it out
of that or alive tonight.

23:50.698 --> 23:52.533
Hmm. Is that right?

23:52.633 --> 23:55.369
I mean, I figure I got
a 50-50 chance of dying

23:55.469 --> 23:57.438
any time I leave my apartment.

23:58.305 --> 24:00.240
But today,

24:00.341 --> 24:04.044
there was an 80% chance
everything for me

24:04.144 --> 24:06.013
was just gonna stop.

24:07.214 --> 24:09.116
There was an 80% chance

24:09.216 --> 24:11.296
<i>you and I were never
gonna talk about
star wars again.</i>

24:12.786 --> 24:14.154
There was an 80% chance

24:14.254 --> 24:15.855
I would never know
for a medical fact,

24:15.956 --> 24:18.258
I got a normal-sized dick.

24:18.359 --> 24:20.060
You always said it was huge.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.528
I was gonna miss a lot of shit

24:21.628 --> 24:23.931
if you didn't call
that ambulance today.

24:25.699 --> 24:27.634
You saved my life, man.

24:27.735 --> 24:29.236
Oh.

24:29.336 --> 24:31.972
I wish I had a life
worth fucking saving.

24:32.072 --> 24:33.073
Come on, man.

24:33.173 --> 24:35.509
What are you talking about?

24:35.609 --> 24:36.777
When I was lying there,

24:36.876 --> 24:39.480
wondering if I was gonna die,

24:39.580 --> 24:43.350
I saw the whole
movie of my life
flash before my eyes.

24:44.952 --> 24:46.320
You know what?

24:47.087 --> 24:49.089
It sucked.

24:50.724 --> 24:53.994
I always thought, hoped...

24:54.094 --> 24:58.065
That my life
was building
towards something.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.300
Turns out it was
just the hospital.

25:00.401 --> 25:01.602
What are you talking about?

25:01.702 --> 25:03.704
We built our own business.

25:03.804 --> 25:06.373
So I co-own
a convenience
store. Big deal.

25:06.473 --> 25:09.176
I never went anywhere
outside of Jersey.

25:09.276 --> 25:11.378
I never fell in love like you.

25:11.478 --> 25:13.180
If I'd have
dropped dead tonight,

25:13.280 --> 25:16.316
only you and Elias would
remember I even existed.

25:16.417 --> 25:20.354
I mean, look
at me, man,
I'm almost 50.

25:20.454 --> 25:22.156
I sit around and watch the same

25:22.256 --> 25:24.291
stupid movies over and over.

25:26.093 --> 25:28.262
The fuck is wrong with me?

25:28.896 --> 25:30.931
I don't know.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.599
You know so much
about all that stuff.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.002
I always thought you could
have made a cool movie.

25:42.776 --> 25:44.211
Holy shit.

25:45.078 --> 25:46.346
You're right.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.186
I could make
a pretty cool movie.

25:52.286 --> 25:54.755
I've been
watching movies
all my life,

25:54.855 --> 25:56.657
I've seen all
these people
tell their stories

25:56.757 --> 25:59.526
and never once
thought about
trying to tell mine.

25:59.626 --> 26:00.961
Well, fuck that, man.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.563
Since I almost died tonight,

26:02.663 --> 26:05.132
now I know I'm living
on borrowed time.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.167
So, no more watching movies

26:07.267 --> 26:09.136
because when
I get out of here...

26:10.404 --> 26:13.140
I'm gonna make a movie!

26:19.580 --> 26:20.781
A movie?

26:20.881 --> 26:22.625
Don't you have to go to
film school or something?

26:22.649 --> 26:26.286
It's like 75 g's a year
to go to nyu film school.

26:26.386 --> 26:28.923
And you know what
those kids pay
all that money for?

26:29.022 --> 26:31.258
I don't know.
To watch movies.

26:31.358 --> 26:34.261
I worked in a video
store for 20 years

26:34.361 --> 26:36.563
where I sat around
and watched
movies all day, too.

26:36.663 --> 26:40.234
So basically,
I went to my own
film school.

26:40.334 --> 26:43.303
Just because you've seen
every movie ever made,

26:43.403 --> 26:45.506
doesn't mean you can make
any kind of movie at all.

26:45.606 --> 26:47.508
Tell that to Quentin Tarantino.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.610
Oh, now you're
Quentin Tarantino?

26:49.710 --> 26:53.380
I'm not saying
I'm gonna make
a movie as good as him,

26:53.480 --> 26:55.182
but I'm not good at sex either,

26:55.282 --> 26:57.202
and that doesn't stop me
from trying to get laid.

27:06.026 --> 27:07.661
You wanna shoot a movie here,

27:07.761 --> 27:09.396
at the quickstop?

27:09.496 --> 27:11.441
Yeah, I've seen
convenience stores
in flicks before,

27:11.465 --> 27:13.400
but I've never seen
an entire flick

27:13.500 --> 27:15.135
set in a convenience store.

27:15.235 --> 27:16.803
Because who would
wanna watch that?

27:16.905 --> 27:19.139
I mean, it's my life
and I barely
wanna live it.

27:19.239 --> 27:21.808
This movie's meant
to memorialize
my life.

27:21.910 --> 27:23.210
And since I spent the last

27:23.310 --> 27:24.654
30 years of my life
working here...

27:24.678 --> 27:26.246
Oh. Working?

27:26.346 --> 27:28.382
I got plenty of
convenience stories

27:28.482 --> 27:30.183
to put into a screenplay.

27:30.284 --> 27:32.152
<i>Convenience stories.
Good title.</i>

27:32.252 --> 27:33.955
Well, what kind of
convenience stories

27:34.087 --> 27:35.422
are we talking about here?

27:35.522 --> 27:37.457
Remember the time we went to

27:37.558 --> 27:40.193
Julie dwyer's funeral
and you knocked
the casket over?

27:40.294 --> 27:42.229
You knocked the casket over.

27:42.997 --> 27:44.097
I did?

27:44.197 --> 27:45.866
Well, that's a scene now.

27:45.967 --> 27:47.610
Or how about the time
the old guy
was jerking off

27:47.634 --> 27:49.336
in the bathroom
and dropped dead?

27:49.436 --> 27:51.204
That's totally a scene, man.

27:51.305 --> 27:53.007
I mean, all the shit
you and I have said

27:53.106 --> 27:54.308
sitting at this counter,

27:54.408 --> 27:55.842
these are all scenes now, man.

27:55.944 --> 27:57.554
How about the time
you burned
the store down?

27:57.578 --> 27:59.179
Is that gonna be a scene?

27:59.279 --> 28:00.456
I'm still pretty sure
terrorists did that.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.682
Uh-huh.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.116
Hey, hey!

28:04.184 --> 28:05.752
Motley crewneck.

28:07.287 --> 28:09.323
Anyone in your
Christian crypto club

28:09.423 --> 28:12.259
got a non-crypto camera
we can borrow?

28:12.359 --> 28:14.028
It's called
the crimson
crypto club now.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.597
Our first drops
gonna be all
crypto kites.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.465
Oh, put that
shit away,
elon muskrat.

28:18.565 --> 28:20.233
What do you guys
need a camera for?

28:20.334 --> 28:22.536
Mmm.
Randal wants
to make a movie.

28:22.636 --> 28:24.204
Ooh, like a pornography movie?

28:24.304 --> 28:26.106
No, like a movie-movie,

28:26.206 --> 28:28.308
one with actors and a screenplay

28:28.408 --> 28:30.110
and crafty.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.511
What's crafty?

28:31.612 --> 28:33.146
That's where the,
uh, crew hangs out

28:33.246 --> 28:34.414
and practices witchcraft,

28:34.514 --> 28:36.316
you little devil worshipper.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.251
Cool.

28:38.352 --> 28:40.989
Crafty is where
you find all
the food on set.

28:41.089 --> 28:42.298
But if you're shooting in here,

28:42.322 --> 28:44.092
I guess the whole
store's crafty.

28:44.191 --> 28:45.759
What's the movie gonna be about?

28:45.859 --> 28:47.403
Mmm, it's gonna
be about an hour
and a half.

28:47.427 --> 28:48.930
I hate long movies.

28:49.030 --> 28:51.398
It's about him
working here.
Wow.

28:51.498 --> 28:53.467
Meta. Never seen
a whole movie

28:53.567 --> 28:55.135
set in
a convenience
store before.

28:55.235 --> 28:56.971
Right? Thank you.

28:57.071 --> 28:59.007
I'm gonna fill
the script with
all the weird shit

28:59.107 --> 29:00.187
me and Dante have ever said

29:00.273 --> 29:01.308
or seen around here

29:01.408 --> 29:02.776
over the years.
Oh.

29:02.876 --> 29:04.354
You should put
in that stuff
you used to say

29:04.378 --> 29:05.779
about the death star
contractors.

29:05.879 --> 29:08.548
Get sued by Disney?
Fuck that.

29:08.649 --> 29:10.617
Besides, I don't want
this movie to be about

29:10.717 --> 29:12.719
other movies.
I want it to
be about me.

29:12.819 --> 29:14.488
It's my flick,
so I wanna write about

29:14.588 --> 29:16.124
the things that I do.

29:16.223 --> 29:18.558
Like, um, like how
we play hockey
on the rooftop.

29:18.659 --> 29:21.228
I've never seen
that done in a movie
or a TV show,

29:21.328 --> 29:23.597
even though
it's just
fucking practical.

29:23.697 --> 29:25.265
Remember that fight

29:25.365 --> 29:26.476
where I hit you
in the face
with the bread?

29:26.500 --> 29:28.002
Ooh, that could be a scene.

29:28.102 --> 29:29.904
Or the time
I spit water
on that old guy?

29:30.004 --> 29:32.339
That's, like,
the fucking
opening scene.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.008
Ooh, I got an idea.

29:34.108 --> 29:35.828
Maybe Jay and
silent Bob
could be characters.

29:35.910 --> 29:38.345
That is the
dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

29:38.445 --> 29:39.680
Well, you're still gonna have

29:39.780 --> 29:41.248
to get them involved
if you wanna set

29:41.348 --> 29:42.859
any of the scenes
in your old video store.

29:42.883 --> 29:44.685
All right.
Watch the
register, dawg.

29:44.785 --> 29:47.454
We got to go talk
to the Warner
brothers.

29:48.789 --> 29:51.191
What the fuck, man?
We heard you died.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.061
Almost.
What happened

29:53.161 --> 29:55.063
is I was taking a shit
in the high grass

29:55.163 --> 29:56.263
when a rattlesnake came up

29:56.363 --> 29:58.198
and bit me right on the asshole.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.300
But like the good friend he is,

30:00.400 --> 30:02.602
Dante sucked the poison out.

30:02.703 --> 30:05.505
See? It happened
to them, too, man.

30:05.605 --> 30:07.483
Well, listen,
when we thought
you were dead, man,

30:07.507 --> 30:09.543
I felt really, really bad

30:09.643 --> 30:11.254
'cause in all the time
I've been hanging out

30:11.278 --> 30:12.612
in front of this
store and stuff,

30:12.713 --> 30:14.848
I forgot to give you something.

30:24.224 --> 30:25.692
<i>Dental school?</i>

30:25.792 --> 30:29.296
Me and veggie dick
rented that shit
in 1994,

30:29.396 --> 30:30.797
but we never watched it

30:30.897 --> 30:33.300
'cause we didn't have a VCR.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.502
But now,
you can put it
on the shelf

30:35.602 --> 30:37.871
in the video store.
Oh, yeah.

30:37.972 --> 30:40.942
Uh, the video
store closed
ten years ago.

30:42.843 --> 30:44.112
It did?

30:44.212 --> 30:46.413
This was the video store.

30:51.618 --> 30:53.187
Oh, yeah, I'm getting senile

30:53.286 --> 30:54.821
and shit right there, you know?

30:54.922 --> 30:57.858
So listen,
how much we owe
you for late fees?

30:57.959 --> 31:03.164
Uh, well,
let's see, a dollar
a day for what,

31:03.263 --> 31:06.466
26, 28 years?

31:06.566 --> 31:12.572
That's, like,
approximately...
$10,220.

31:14.341 --> 31:15.776
Oh, didn't rewind.

31:16.610 --> 31:20.413
$10,220 and 50 cents.

31:22.150 --> 31:24.018
You take crypto?

31:24.118 --> 31:25.585
You guys got crypto?

31:27.255 --> 31:28.388
No.

31:28.488 --> 31:29.756
If you never watched it,

31:29.856 --> 31:31.591
why was it
not rewound?
Yeah.

31:31.691 --> 31:33.928
Hey, asshole,
I said we didn't
have a VCR.

31:34.028 --> 31:36.797
We watched it.
We held it up
to the light.

31:37.664 --> 31:38.933
Fucking luddite.

31:39.033 --> 31:41.035
Listen, we'll squash
your giant late fees

31:41.135 --> 31:44.205
<i>on the 28-year-old copy
of dental school</i>

31:44.304 --> 31:45.704
if you let us shoot
a movie in here.

31:45.739 --> 31:48.075
Ooh, a pornography movie?

31:48.176 --> 31:50.510
No, it's not a porno movie.

31:50.610 --> 31:53.780
Sex sells, son,
and I'm always buying

31:53.880 --> 31:58.385
'cause I am the clit commander!

31:58.485 --> 31:59.820
Snootchie bootchies.

32:05.026 --> 32:07.327
<i>♪ I love nachos</i>

32:07.427 --> 32:09.863
<i>♪ nachos from 7-Eleven</i>

32:09.964 --> 32:11.966

they're bad for me</i>

32:12.066 --> 32:15.069
<i>♪ when I eat them

32:15.169 --> 32:17.271

32:22.076 --> 32:25.412
<i>♪ Liquid toppings

32:30.184 --> 32:31.418
Goodnight.

32:32.019 --> 32:33.520
Thirty-seven?

32:37.490 --> 32:38.792
That's not a scene, randal.

32:38.892 --> 32:40.294
Stop writing it right now.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.895
Thirty-seven cannot go
in your movie.

32:41.996 --> 32:44.664
Shut the fuck up.
It's nighttime!

32:49.203 --> 32:51.404
<i>"In convenience"?</i>

32:51.504 --> 32:53.174
It's the story of my life.

32:53.274 --> 32:55.276
Hundred and
sixty-eight pages
full of dick jokes,

32:55.375 --> 32:56.543
set in a convenience store,

32:56.643 --> 32:58.378
written in one night.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.248
Maybe don't
tell people
that last part.

33:00.348 --> 33:02.883
<i>I thought, you were
gonna call it
"convenience stories."</i>

33:02.984 --> 33:05.286
Yeah, that
shit sounded
too precious.

33:05.385 --> 33:06.620
What am I, Wes Anderson?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.189
Not based on this script.

33:08.289 --> 33:09.656
"There is only one return

33:09.756 --> 33:11.993
"and it ain't
of the king,
it's of the jedi."

33:12.093 --> 33:13.627
- Hmm.
- Hey.

33:13.727 --> 33:15.129
You said that
same thing
about return

33:15.229 --> 33:16.897
the day that
guy threw up
in mooby's

33:16.998 --> 33:18.632
and you made
me clean it.
Yeah.

33:18.732 --> 33:20.043
Everything
in the script
is something

33:20.067 --> 33:21.369
either me or someone
I know said,

33:21.468 --> 33:22.669
I just made up new names.

33:22.769 --> 33:24.071
What am I, some kind of writer?

33:24.171 --> 33:25.572
Ah, yes.

33:25.672 --> 33:27.341
Blockchain
would like
to understand

33:27.440 --> 33:29.643
why the two girls
are into this
"Dan-t" character

33:29.743 --> 33:31.946
when the Randy
character is
much funnier.

33:32.046 --> 33:33.546
Randy has been asking himself

33:33.647 --> 33:35.116
the same question
his whole life.

33:35.216 --> 33:36.816
What's wrong with Dan-t?

33:36.918 --> 33:39.153
Read his first scene on page 37.

33:39.253 --> 33:40.687
Are you kidding me?

33:40.787 --> 33:42.199
I'm in this
convenience store
way more than you,

33:42.223 --> 33:43.423
but I don't come into your

33:43.523 --> 33:45.259
convenience store
movie 'til page 37?

33:45.359 --> 33:47.295
I had a lot of exposition to do.

33:47.395 --> 33:48.828
"Enter Dan-t.

33:48.930 --> 33:51.399
"A hideous fuckin'
chud of a man."
What the fuck?

33:51.498 --> 33:53.566
Well, maybe Dan-t's not you.

33:53.667 --> 33:54.969
Do you ever think of that?

33:55.069 --> 33:57.271
"Dan-t's
hideous fuckin'
chud of a beard

33:57.371 --> 34:00.473
"doesn't suggest Tony
stark so much as
a male crack whore

34:00.573 --> 34:02.209
"who is cosplaying
as Tony stark."

34:02.310 --> 34:04.345
That's just
in the screen
direction.

34:04.444 --> 34:05.980
Nobody actually calls Dan-t

34:06.080 --> 34:08.581
"a hideous
fuckin' chud."
To his face.

34:08.682 --> 34:09.783
I can't believe you made me

34:09.883 --> 34:11.551
sign a non-disclosure agreement,

34:11.651 --> 34:13.187
only to read that I'm not even

34:13.287 --> 34:14.998
one of the main
characters in the
story of your life.

34:15.022 --> 34:16.523
I mean, I knew
I was never the Luke,

34:16.623 --> 34:18.023
but I thought
I was at least
the han.

34:18.059 --> 34:19.659
Oh, come on, I'm the han

34:19.759 --> 34:20.794
and the Luke, right?

34:20.894 --> 34:23.463
Then who am I, the Chewie?

34:23.563 --> 34:25.166
I think Elias is more
the Chewie, no?

34:25.266 --> 34:27.201
Unless this is empire
then I'm the lando

34:27.301 --> 34:28.668
and he's the lobot.

34:28.768 --> 34:30.071
I'm not even the lobot?

34:30.171 --> 34:31.571
Which one's lobot?

34:31.671 --> 34:32.815
He's the one with
the headphones
who looks like

34:32.839 --> 34:34.039
a dad who's trying to be a dj.

34:34.108 --> 34:35.709
The bald fucker from bespin

34:35.809 --> 34:37.220
who never
says nothing
the whole movie.

34:37.244 --> 34:39.180
Wouldn't that make
silent Bob the lobot?

34:39.280 --> 34:42.849
No. Jay and silent
Bob are clearly the
C-3PO and r2-d2.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.790
I mean, they've
been here since
the first movie,

34:44.818 --> 34:46.753
which was
the last time
they were cool,

34:46.853 --> 34:48.688
but they've been
with the franchise
so long

34:48.788 --> 34:49.957
they still give them cameos

34:50.057 --> 34:51.524
and put them on the lunchboxes.

34:51.624 --> 34:55.262
So if I'm not
Luke, han,
Chewie, lando,

34:55.363 --> 34:56.863
the droids or the lobot,

34:56.964 --> 34:58.665
<i>then who the fuck
am I in your
star wars,</i>

34:58.765 --> 35:00.667
Princess
fucking Leia?
No.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.136
You're the dak.

35:02.236 --> 35:04.537
Who the fuck is dak?

35:04.637 --> 35:06.073
He's Luke Skywalker's
tail gunner

35:06.173 --> 35:07.841
in the battle of hoth.

35:07.942 --> 35:09.410
You know, the guy who's ready

35:09.509 --> 35:10.911
to take on the whole
empire himself

35:11.012 --> 35:12.621
until the empire kills
the shit out of him?

35:12.645 --> 35:15.782
Did dak
even get an
action figure?

35:15.882 --> 35:18.019
Not in the classic
kenner line, no.

35:18.119 --> 35:19.719
Because?

35:19.819 --> 35:21.465
Because he was
deemed unimportant
to the story.

35:21.489 --> 35:22.923
But that's just bullshit, man.

35:23.024 --> 35:26.260
Without dak,
Luke could
have never...

35:26.360 --> 35:30.164
Like, dak was
the only guy
that's, like, uh...

35:30.264 --> 35:33.867
I mean, dak was
plucky as shit, man,
just like you.

35:33.968 --> 35:35.936
Uh, I have a question
about the script.

35:36.037 --> 35:37.304
Great, more fuckin' notes.

35:37.405 --> 35:39.073
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

35:39.173 --> 35:41.875
Uh, I have a problem
with the friar
fuck character,

35:41.976 --> 35:43.610
who, I believe,
is supposed to be me.

35:43.710 --> 35:46.380
Friar fuck, uh, loves Jesus,

35:46.480 --> 35:49.783
uh, to what appears to
be an unhealthy degree.

35:50.217 --> 35:51.385
And?

35:51.485 --> 35:54.088
And Elias is a born
again satanist.

35:54.188 --> 35:56.023
Because it was Satan
who saved you

35:56.123 --> 35:58.591
when my prayers
fell on the deaf
ears of Jesus,

35:58.691 --> 36:00.660
the giant jerkoff.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.363
All right,
listen up,
friar fuck.

36:02.463 --> 36:03.763
I get that you just broke up

36:03.863 --> 36:05.732
with your boyfriend
Jesus recently,

36:05.832 --> 36:07.734
and clearly you're
going through
some couture

36:07.834 --> 36:09.437
and cosmetic stuff
because of it.

36:09.537 --> 36:11.372
But for the
first 36 years
of your life,

36:11.472 --> 36:14.341
you were into Jesus
to an unhealthy degree,

36:14.442 --> 36:17.610
and that's the Elias
that I based
friar fuck on.

36:17.710 --> 36:19.413
Then this script
is based on lies.

36:19.513 --> 36:20.880
Welcome to the movie biz.

36:20.981 --> 36:23.583
There's no truth in this art!

36:23.683 --> 36:24.851
Jesus.

36:24.952 --> 36:27.555
Everyone's a critic.

36:27.654 --> 36:28.888
So, what do we do next?

36:28.989 --> 36:30.723
What are you asking dak for?

36:30.824 --> 36:33.527
Well, I can't do this alone.
I need a producer.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.563
That's your job.
Me?

36:35.662 --> 36:37.364
What do I know about producing?

36:37.465 --> 36:39.145
Come on. I'm already
writing and directing.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.700
I can't do everything, man.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.769
All right. What does
a producer do?

36:42.869 --> 36:45.506
Just build us a schedule,
keep us under budget,

36:45.605 --> 36:48.175
secure a dp,
and most importantly,

36:48.275 --> 36:49.809
find us financing.

36:49.910 --> 36:52.879
What, I gotta get money, too?

36:52.980 --> 36:54.348
How much are we
talking about here?

36:54.448 --> 36:56.517
Mmm, 25 grand.

36:56.616 --> 36:59.420
$25,000?

36:59.520 --> 37:02.123
Well, technically, it's $27,575

37:02.223 --> 37:04.023
but it would be way more
if we were in Canada.

37:04.091 --> 37:05.559
Where the fuck
am I supposed to find

37:05.658 --> 37:06.893
that kind of money from?

37:06.994 --> 37:08.695
We can find that kind of cash.

37:09.296 --> 37:10.830
What? How?

37:10.931 --> 37:12.509
We launch our
crypto kite
nfts next month.

37:12.533 --> 37:13.867
<i>So the crimson crypto club</i>

37:13.968 --> 37:15.145
<i>could have a lot
of money to invest</i>

37:15.169 --> 37:16.703
if the crypto kites fly.

37:16.803 --> 37:18.439
Again with the fucking kites.

37:18.539 --> 37:20.975
Guys, we need real loot
to make a real movie,

37:21.075 --> 37:23.110
<i>not your make pretend
matrix money,</i>

37:23.210 --> 37:25.246
you fuckin' kite fucker.

37:25.346 --> 37:27.666
I'm sick and tired
of the kite killing
attitude around here.

37:31.851 --> 37:33.354
Anyway, back to the budget.

37:33.454 --> 37:34.830
What if we took
out a loan
against the store?

37:34.854 --> 37:36.190
A loan?

37:36.290 --> 37:38.058
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't we just

37:38.159 --> 37:39.702
slow down a minute
and think about
this first?

37:39.726 --> 37:41.728
Slow down?
I almost died, man.

37:41.828 --> 37:43.364
It doesn't get
any slower than that.

37:43.464 --> 37:46.066
I'm not getting all
"Dante" about this.

37:46.167 --> 37:47.800
Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

37:47.902 --> 37:49.262
You're the guy
who can never decide

37:49.303 --> 37:51.005
whether to shit
or get off the pot.

37:51.105 --> 37:53.140
Well, I don't
have time
for that anymore.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.142
From now on,
I'm gonna shit bricks

37:55.242 --> 37:57.178
or what's the point
of being here?

37:57.278 --> 37:58.379
So, come on, man,

37:58.479 --> 38:00.680
get behind me
when I shit for once.

38:00.780 --> 38:03.284
So I can what, wipe your ass?

38:05.052 --> 38:06.496
You know, I don't wanna get
all "Dante" about this,

38:06.520 --> 38:09.089
but find someone else
to take your shit.

38:27.942 --> 38:31.579
Well, well, well, here he is.

38:31.679 --> 38:33.380
The escape artist.

38:35.748 --> 38:38.052
<i>I sit on your grave.</i>

38:38.152 --> 38:40.955
Didn't
we have that movie
at the video store?

38:41.055 --> 38:42.957
<i>I spit on your grave.</i>

38:43.057 --> 38:44.857
Hicks, you spit
on my grave
in a dream,

38:44.959 --> 38:46.493
you better wake up
and apologize.

38:46.594 --> 38:47.794
Ah...

38:47.894 --> 38:50.030
So this is a dream.
Uh, if it is,

38:50.130 --> 38:52.832
then you need to learn
to dream bigger.

38:52.933 --> 38:54.168
I mean, really,

38:54.268 --> 38:55.835
this is the best
that you can do?

38:56.704 --> 38:58.172
A cemetery?

38:58.272 --> 39:01.675
You can't dream us into sex...

39:01.774 --> 39:03.244
On the beach...

39:03.911 --> 39:06.146
In Hawaii?

39:06.247 --> 39:08.649
Like you'd wanna
have sex with me now.

39:08.748 --> 39:10.718
I'm an old man.

39:10.817 --> 39:13.087
I'll have you know
that being dead only

39:13.187 --> 39:15.589
increases your sex drive.

39:16.856 --> 39:19.627
The dead live to fuck.

39:19.727 --> 39:21.562
So you have sex
in the afterlife?

39:21.662 --> 39:23.097
Hell's yeah.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.165
There's nothing to do
in heaven except fuck.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.534
That's what makes it heaven.

39:27.635 --> 39:29.937
I can't believe my
wife's having sex
with dead people.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.272
Famous dead people.

39:31.372 --> 39:33.107
I'm on the celebrity
circuit now.

39:33.207 --> 39:35.051
Bullshit. Name one
famous person you
fucked in heaven.

39:35.075 --> 39:37.077
One. Okay.

39:37.177 --> 39:41.115
I have knocked boots
with the ghost
of Cleopatra, sir.

39:41.215 --> 39:43.350
Oh.
And miles Davis

39:43.450 --> 39:46.086
and Frederick
douglass,
together.

39:47.187 --> 39:49.323
George Washington...
What?

39:49.423 --> 39:51.158
Carver.
Oh.

39:51.258 --> 39:52.778
You know how much
I love peanut butter.

39:52.825 --> 39:54.728
True.
Who else?

39:54.827 --> 39:56.163
Um, Carl sagan.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.465
Oh!
A real thinker.

39:58.565 --> 39:59.799
Um...

40:00.701 --> 40:02.670
Malcolm X.

40:02.770 --> 40:05.339
Malcolm triple x.
Oh, settle down.

40:05.439 --> 40:08.108
And I'm sure you're letting
them all go ass to mouth.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.544
Uh, yeah, they're famous.

40:17.318 --> 40:19.086
You think
I want this,
don't you?

40:20.853 --> 40:23.090
You carrying the torch for me?

40:24.525 --> 40:26.826
I told you how
I feel about
romantic love, Hicks.

40:26.927 --> 40:28.495
Oh, I remember.

40:28.595 --> 40:31.131
You were very
convincing.
Mmm.

40:31.231 --> 40:33.233
Right up until the day
I proposed.

40:35.369 --> 40:37.471
We only knew each other
for, like, 15 minutes.

40:37.571 --> 40:40.541
You've been mourning me
for, like, 15 years.

40:40.641 --> 40:41.841
So what do you want me to do?

40:41.942 --> 40:43.876
You want me to just
forget about you?

40:43.977 --> 40:46.413
You were all
I ever dreamed about.

40:47.014 --> 40:48.282
Both of you.

40:50.050 --> 40:51.884
Now...

40:53.387 --> 40:56.223
God, I'm so alone.

40:58.826 --> 41:00.294
I know.

41:01.795 --> 41:03.597
I know losing me and grace...

41:04.732 --> 41:05.999
Broke you.

41:07.601 --> 41:09.937
But you don't know
how lucky you have it.

41:10.037 --> 41:11.538
What?

41:11.638 --> 41:14.908
The book of life
is closed
for the two of us.

41:15.008 --> 41:17.578
But you... can still
turn a page.

41:17.678 --> 41:20.581
You get to keep writing
the story of your life.

41:20.681 --> 41:23.584
Why bother without you?

41:23.684 --> 41:27.054
Because there are
more tales
to tell, Hicks.

41:28.355 --> 41:30.491
As long as you're alive,

41:30.591 --> 41:33.293
you can always
start another chapter.

41:34.728 --> 41:39.266
So live while you can,
love while you can.

41:41.602 --> 41:42.903
God damn it.

41:45.172 --> 41:46.540
Dream bigger.

41:49.476 --> 41:52.146
That all sounds pretty romantic

41:52.246 --> 41:55.082
coming from a girl
who doesn't believe
in romantic love.

41:55.182 --> 41:57.050
I don't believe
in romantic love.

41:57.151 --> 41:59.119
That's my girl.

42:01.221 --> 42:02.689
But I do believe in you.

42:31.618 --> 42:33.530
Hey, I wanna thank
you guys for having
me here today.

42:33.554 --> 42:36.290
I've always wanted
to be an actor.

42:36.390 --> 42:37.691
Nice.

42:37.791 --> 42:42.396
I'm not even
supposed to be
here today!

42:42.496 --> 42:44.198
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

42:44.298 --> 42:45.966
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

42:46.066 --> 42:48.836
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

42:51.472 --> 42:53.307
I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

42:53.407 --> 42:54.975
I'm not even supposed

42:55.075 --> 42:58.479
to fucking be here
to fucking day, fucks.

42:58.579 --> 43:01.448
Oh, shit! I thought
that was the police.

43:01.548 --> 43:03.183
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

43:03.283 --> 43:05.385
By the power of grayskull,

43:05.486 --> 43:11.058
I am not supposed
to be here today!

43:11.158 --> 43:12.526
Hey, I'm Joe.

43:12.626 --> 43:14.261
Uh, I'm 45-years-old,
recently divorced,

43:14.361 --> 43:16.430
and I figured I'd give
this shit a go. Uh...

43:16.530 --> 43:18.532
I am not even supposed
to be here today.

43:19.867 --> 43:21.568
Damn right.

43:21.668 --> 43:23.871
Uh...

43:23.972 --> 43:25.907
Lion face.

43:26.006 --> 43:28.575
Lemon face.

43:28.675 --> 43:32.479
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

43:32.579 --> 43:34.414
Um...
A little about me.

43:34.515 --> 43:36.918
I'm known professionally
as Boston John.

43:37.017 --> 43:38.652
<i>That's a nom de plume.</i>

43:38.752 --> 43:42.456
Uh, Robert De Niro
is my fuckin'...
Lone star.

43:42.556 --> 43:44.691
You know what I'm saying?
Close your eyes. Just...

43:44.791 --> 43:47.694
Close your eyes.
Just listen.
Ready? All right?

43:47.794 --> 43:49.964
I have nipples, Greg.

43:50.063 --> 43:51.966
Could you milk me?

43:52.065 --> 43:54.735
Fuck, that is one,
bitch. All day.

43:54.835 --> 43:56.905
Can you give me one
like Schwarzenegger?

43:57.005 --> 43:59.339
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

43:59.439 --> 44:01.875
But can you, uh,
Pacino that shit?

44:01.976 --> 44:02.977
Ooh-ah!

44:03.076 --> 44:04.645
When, lord?

44:04.745 --> 44:08.148
When will I see
the god damn sailboat?

44:09.516 --> 44:13.053
That came from a real
deep personal place.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.454
I have a bfa.

44:14.555 --> 44:16.123
Uh, I'm a theater
background actor.

44:16.223 --> 44:18.125
As an actor with
a theater background,

44:18.225 --> 44:20.028
I was classically
trained in New York.

44:20.127 --> 44:21.828
Have you actually thought

44:21.930 --> 44:23.172
about going
musical with this?
'Cause it could be...

44:23.196 --> 44:24.298
<i>♪ I'm not even...</i>

44:24.398 --> 44:26.700
Supposed to be here.

44:26.800 --> 44:30.470
<i>♪ Today ♪</i>

44:30.571 --> 44:33.407
Hah, hoo, hah.
Yeah-cha!

44:33.507 --> 44:36.243
Kick ball change
and snap,
snap, jazz hands.

44:36.343 --> 44:38.478
That is beautiful, man.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.448
Freddie prinze Jr.

44:43.150 --> 44:44.986
"I'll fuck anything
that moves."

44:45.085 --> 44:47.021
Wait, wait a minute, man,
is this a porno?

44:47.120 --> 44:48.990
I'll fuck anything that moves.

44:49.089 --> 44:50.357
I'll fuck anything that moves.

44:50.457 --> 44:51.993
I'll fuck anything that moves.

44:52.092 --> 44:53.372
That's a little bit
in your face.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.128
Let me try it
like this, hold on.

44:55.228 --> 44:57.106
Can I borrow
your underpants
for about ten minutes?

44:57.130 --> 44:58.699
I'll fuck anything that moves.

44:58.799 --> 44:59.901
And, fool,

45:00.001 --> 45:02.436
I always carry a machete.

45:02.536 --> 45:05.772
I'll fuck anything that moves!

45:05.872 --> 45:07.608
Sounds like the guy
I buy weed from.

45:07.708 --> 45:08.977
You know what this movie needs?

45:09.077 --> 45:11.478
Deez. Deez nuts!

45:11.578 --> 45:13.513
Can I just offer you
a piece of advice?

45:13.614 --> 45:15.315
You know what
this script
needs right here?

45:15.415 --> 45:18.019
Like an old lady
that says curse words.

45:18.118 --> 45:19.853
Holy shit.

45:19.954 --> 45:22.689
Who wrote this garbage?
His mother should
be ashamed.

45:26.760 --> 45:27.996
The fuck?

45:28.096 --> 45:30.230
He's auditioning
for silent bill.

45:32.967 --> 45:34.635
<i>I don't know if you know
sound of music,</i>

45:34.735 --> 45:36.412
the marionettes were
the best part of that.

45:36.436 --> 45:39.941
I think that's why
they won oscars.

45:40.041 --> 45:41.775
It's worth thinking about

45:41.875 --> 45:45.178
maybe doing
the whole movie
with marionettes.

45:53.720 --> 45:55.089
Take your heart pills, tin man.

45:55.188 --> 45:56.757
Hey.

45:56.857 --> 45:58.592
So, how's it going
with the financing?

45:58.692 --> 46:00.227
You raise my money, yet?

46:00.327 --> 46:01.595
If it's your money,

46:01.695 --> 46:03.064
then how come
I have to raise it?

46:03.163 --> 46:04.698
That's Hollywood.

46:04.798 --> 46:06.134
Did you finish
reading the script?

46:06.233 --> 46:07.300
Last night.

46:07.401 --> 46:09.137
And? It's funny,
right?

46:09.236 --> 46:10.972
It's funny,

46:11.072 --> 46:13.607
but it was like
my entire life flashed
before my eyes.

46:13.707 --> 46:16.144
My life flashed
before your eyes.

46:16.243 --> 46:18.612
I was glad you left
some stuff out.

46:20.714 --> 46:21.748
So, uh...

46:21.848 --> 46:24.052
Which one of these guys
gets to play me?

46:24.152 --> 46:25.352
Well, the guys are too young

46:25.452 --> 46:27.254
and hot to play you.
What the fuck?

46:27.354 --> 46:30.091
And nobody's nearly
funny enough to play me.

46:30.223 --> 46:31.463
So then, what are you gonna do?

46:31.558 --> 46:34.194
I'm gonna play my part myself.

46:45.839 --> 46:49.342
All right, already,
we're closing.
Gee whiz!

46:49.443 --> 46:52.412
Why? You're highly
offending me!

46:52.512 --> 46:55.049
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Jesus.

46:55.149 --> 46:57.250
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closed.

46:57.350 --> 46:58.852
It's me, randal.

46:58.953 --> 47:01.555
<i>Huh. Cool.
Blade runner,
I like that.</i>

47:01.655 --> 47:03.790
<i>Thanks. What's
a blade runner?</i>

47:03.890 --> 47:05.927
Can we get back to you
acting in a movie

47:06.027 --> 47:08.495
that you're directing
even though you've
never acted in

47:08.595 --> 47:10.064
or directed a movie before?

47:10.164 --> 47:11.565
It worked for Orson welles.

47:11.665 --> 47:13.266
You're not an actor.

47:13.366 --> 47:14.668
Neither was Howard stern,

47:14.768 --> 47:16.636
but he acted
in the movie
about his life.

47:16.737 --> 47:18.005
If you call that acting.

47:18.106 --> 47:19.539
You think you can do better?

47:19.639 --> 47:21.775
<i>Better than Howard stern
did in private parts?</i>

47:21.875 --> 47:23.477
It's not a high bar.

47:23.577 --> 47:25.947
Great, because
you're playing Dan-t.

47:26.047 --> 47:28.682
What? No, no, no.
I'm not. I can't act.

47:28.782 --> 47:30.218
You're as good
as any of the jokers

47:30.317 --> 47:31.785
we saw at 1the audition.

47:31.885 --> 47:34.354
Besides, if i'm
gonna play me,
you gotta play you.

47:34.454 --> 47:36.323
You have
to do this,
Mr. Dan-t.

47:36.423 --> 47:37.624
Oh, for god's sakes,

47:37.724 --> 47:39.659
please stop calling me
Mr. Dan-t.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.695
That's another thing.
Fuck all the fake names.

47:41.795 --> 47:44.165
<i>What is this shit, mad magazine?</i>

47:44.264 --> 47:46.466
Randal is playing randal.

47:46.566 --> 47:50.570
Dante is playing Dante,
aka Mr. Dante,

47:50.670 --> 47:53.740
and Elias is playing Elias.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.308
I'm in the movie, too?

47:55.408 --> 47:57.410
Yup. And as a satanist
playing a Christian,

47:57.511 --> 47:59.446
you've gotta act the most.

47:59.546 --> 48:01.782
It's my very own chance...

48:01.882 --> 48:03.350
To transform.

48:03.450 --> 48:05.819
And transform
you shall,
Bumblebee.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.990
Soon as Mr. Dante
secures our
fuckin' financing.

48:09.090 --> 48:11.625
Yo, it's too bad
you didn't marry
that Emma chick,

48:11.725 --> 48:13.493
the one with the big clit.

48:13.593 --> 48:15.896
Wasn't she like some
kinda car wash heiress
or something?

48:15.997 --> 48:17.198
Can you focus?

48:17.297 --> 48:18.765
Even if we do play ourselves,

48:18.865 --> 48:20.625
you still got to cast
all the customer parts.

48:20.667 --> 48:24.138
Why am I casting
customers to say
all this stupid shit

48:24.238 --> 48:25.806
when I still see
the real customers

48:25.907 --> 48:27.707
who said all
the stupid shit
in the first place

48:27.741 --> 48:30.278
come in here every day?
They can do it.

48:30.377 --> 48:32.213
Oh, my god, you can't just turn

48:32.312 --> 48:34.015
regular people into movie stars.

48:34.115 --> 48:37.251
Noinch, noinch, noinch!
Smokin' weed.

48:37.350 --> 48:38.685
Smokin' weed!

48:38.785 --> 48:40.121
Pack of wraps, my good man.

48:40.221 --> 48:41.581
Time to kick back,
drink some beers

48:41.621 --> 48:42.990
and smoke some weed.

48:43.090 --> 48:45.293
You own a whole weed store.

48:45.392 --> 48:46.793
Hey, randal, I've got an idea.

48:46.893 --> 48:49.663
What if Jay and Bob
play Jay and Bob?

48:49.763 --> 48:52.934
Well, we can
ask 'em. Yo.

48:53.034 --> 48:55.368
Youse guys want to
be in my movie?

48:55.468 --> 48:57.271
Ooh, a pornography movie?

48:57.370 --> 48:58.906
It's not a porno movie.

48:59.006 --> 49:00.686
It's the movie
we're shooting
in your store.

49:00.774 --> 49:03.177
That movie?
You still ain't done?

49:03.277 --> 49:05.012
We haven't even started yet.

49:05.112 --> 49:08.615
I don't know. Who would
we be playing
in this movie?

49:08.715 --> 49:10.393
Well, it's these
two characters
I kind of based

49:10.417 --> 49:12.419
on you and Maggie Simpson here.

49:12.519 --> 49:14.821
Check out your first scene.

49:14.922 --> 49:16.857
These guys aren't real actors.

49:16.958 --> 49:19.193
But they are real
fucked up and I could
work with that.

49:19.293 --> 49:21.229
This doesn't sound
like me at all.

49:21.329 --> 49:22.662
What are you talking about?

49:22.762 --> 49:24.598
All the shit in there
is all the stuff

49:24.698 --> 49:27.101
I've personally heard
you say around here.

49:27.201 --> 49:28.702
I do not talk like this, man.

49:28.802 --> 49:30.604
Why do you have me
saying stupid shit like

49:30.704 --> 49:32.340
"snootchie bootchies"
all the time?

49:32.439 --> 49:33.975
I'll tell you what.

49:34.075 --> 49:36.110
If you guys
play yourselves
in the movie,

49:36.210 --> 49:38.612
I'll let you guys
be in charge
of crafty, too.

49:38.712 --> 49:40.747
So what's crafty about?

49:40.847 --> 49:43.683
Well, in addition to
being the comic
relief in the movie,

49:43.783 --> 49:46.153
you'd also be in charge
of all the food on set.

49:46.254 --> 49:48.256
Ooh, we learned about food prep

49:48.356 --> 49:51.192
back when we ran
the fucking cock smoker.

49:51.292 --> 49:52.692
Wasn't that place
just a drug front?

49:52.726 --> 49:55.363
No, we had drugs in the front

49:55.462 --> 49:57.564
and drugs in the back.

49:57.664 --> 49:58.899
So if Elias is playing Elias

49:59.000 --> 50:00.767
and these dopes
are playing themselves,

50:00.867 --> 50:02.387
who are you gonna get
to play Veronica?

50:02.469 --> 50:03.803
Well, funny you should ask,

50:03.905 --> 50:05.839
'cause earlier today
I sent the script

50:05.940 --> 50:07.841
to someone who
will be absolutely...

50:07.942 --> 50:10.111
Perfect to play Veronica.

50:11.811 --> 50:14.648
Who the fuck
do you people
think you are?

50:14.748 --> 50:16.750
Veronica?
What is this filth?

50:16.850 --> 50:19.220
What is this gamey, tawdry trash

50:19.320 --> 50:22.223
that makes me out to be
some slutty sex maniac?

50:22.323 --> 50:23.823
It's just a movie I'm making

50:23.925 --> 50:25.393
about my life, and I thought

50:25.492 --> 50:27.104
it'd be fun for you
to play yourself in it.

50:27.128 --> 50:28.329
Oh, you did?

50:28.428 --> 50:29.763
Yeah.

50:29.863 --> 50:31.731
Then you are
fucking sick!
Hey!

50:31.831 --> 50:34.135
Watch it with
my artistic expression.

50:34.235 --> 50:36.971
"Artistic expression"?
That's my life.

50:37.071 --> 50:38.372
It's my life.

50:38.471 --> 50:40.674
Okay, everybody,
calm down.
Jeez.

50:40.774 --> 50:42.094
Oh, come on,
you would have killed

50:42.143 --> 50:43.576
to have been
in a film in college.

50:43.677 --> 50:44.744
You majored in drama.

50:44.844 --> 50:46.914
I minored in drama.

50:47.014 --> 50:49.250
I majored in oral surgery.

50:49.350 --> 50:51.152
All hail the queen of oral.

50:51.252 --> 50:52.719
Fuck you.
Surgery.

50:52.819 --> 50:54.288
You didn't let me finish.

50:54.388 --> 50:56.333
And I'm not gonna let you
finish this film either,

50:56.357 --> 50:58.025
not with me as a character.

50:58.125 --> 51:00.894
I'm not some
fucking joke
you get to tell

51:00.995 --> 51:02.729
in your dirty little b movie,

51:02.829 --> 51:05.899
you two-bit
strip mall soderbergh.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.702
I see myself
more like retail's
Richard linklater.

51:08.802 --> 51:10.071
You want to do this?

51:10.171 --> 51:12.739
Fine, but leave me out of it.

51:12.839 --> 51:15.076
Unlike either of you,
I've got a grown-up job.

51:15.176 --> 51:18.012
And unlike either of you,
I've got a family.

51:21.415 --> 51:23.117
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

51:25.485 --> 51:27.321
I... sorry.

51:39.599 --> 51:40.935
Please don't cry.

51:41.035 --> 51:44.871
It's just been a shit day.

51:46.440 --> 51:48.875
I had two cancelations.

51:48.976 --> 51:50.710
My ex calls to tell me that

51:50.810 --> 51:53.047
he's not putting
our daughter's car

51:53.147 --> 51:54.482
on his insurance,

51:54.581 --> 51:57.751
and so now somehow
she's pissed at me.

51:59.753 --> 52:04.025
And then I see you
and say that shit.

52:04.125 --> 52:06.826
It's okay. Really.

52:06.927 --> 52:10.364
I kinda feel like...
I feel like such
an asshole.

52:10.464 --> 52:13.200
Hey, Ronnie.

52:13.300 --> 52:15.469
If randal told me he was
gonna send you the script,

52:15.568 --> 52:16.971
I would've said no way.

52:17.737 --> 52:19.839
But now, I'm glad he did.

52:21.275 --> 52:22.809
Because it's...

52:22.910 --> 52:26.213
It's really nice to see you.
Even under the circumstances.

52:28.882 --> 52:31.152
And you look great.

52:31.252 --> 52:33.120
You look way younger than I do.

52:33.220 --> 52:35.622
Yeah?
Yeah.

52:35.722 --> 52:38.591
How young you think I look?

52:38.691 --> 52:40.327
You don't look a day over...

52:41.295 --> 52:43.230
37.

52:44.965 --> 52:46.100
So, um...

52:47.935 --> 52:48.935

But it's not my art,
it's your art.

53:41.788 --> 53:43.467
Shouldn't you be
the one doing
the suffering?

53:43.491 --> 53:44.824
I didn't suffer enough

53:44.925 --> 53:46.269
when I almost died
from a heart attack,

53:46.293 --> 53:48.028
which I might add was after

53:48.129 --> 53:49.863

53:57.371 --> 53:58.606
Check out this acting.

53:58.705 --> 54:00.441
Silent Bob,

54:00.541 --> 54:02.977
you are a rrr-rude motherfucker!

54:03.077 --> 54:05.179
But you're cute as hell.

54:05.279 --> 54:08.115
Very natural,
and subtle.
I like it.

54:10.151 --> 54:12.652
So, how are you feeling today?

54:12.752 --> 54:14.687
Oh, you know,
I feel like that kid

54:14.787 --> 54:16.223
that worked in the video store,

54:16.323 --> 54:18.526
fully fluent in
the language of cinema.

54:18.626 --> 54:20.327
It's like I was born to direct.

54:20.427 --> 54:22.387
No, bro. I mean,
you had a heart
attack last month.

54:22.429 --> 54:24.365
Oh, that.
No, I feel fine.

54:24.465 --> 54:25.765
How do you feel today

54:25.865 --> 54:27.800
after your range rover
sleepover last night?

54:27.902 --> 54:30.337
Stop it.
When I said
to be a producer,

54:30.437 --> 54:32.872
I didn't mean produce
a late-in-life child.

54:32.973 --> 54:34.542
Unwilling producer.

54:34.642 --> 54:37.578
I didn't ask
for this job,
but I am doing it.

54:37.677 --> 54:39.914
So I have a meeting
today about money.

54:40.014 --> 54:42.016
Fucking a,
that's producing, j.J.

54:42.116 --> 54:43.984
And I found you
a cinematographer.

54:44.084 --> 54:46.086
What?
May I present to you...

54:47.720 --> 54:48.956
Shooter Bob.

54:50.224 --> 54:52.126
Silent Bob is gonna be our dp?

54:52.226 --> 54:55.596
Shit, yeah,
we all gonna be
doing dps!

54:55.695 --> 54:57.464
Uh, dp is the name of the job.

54:57.565 --> 54:58.774
You said it was cinematographer.

54:58.798 --> 55:01.068
The cinematographer is the dp.

55:01.168 --> 55:02.869
Man, don't be
acting like
you know

55:02.970 --> 55:04.250
all the industry slang and shit.

55:04.338 --> 55:05.973
Me and silent Bob
are the only ones here

55:06.073 --> 55:09.276
who've actually been
on a movie set. Twice.

55:11.212 --> 55:12.379
Come on.

55:12.479 --> 55:14.381
Yes, he's an
unconventional choice,

55:14.481 --> 55:16.917
but you are an
unconventional
filmmaker making

55:17.017 --> 55:18.851
an unconventional film.
Yeah.

55:18.953 --> 55:22.156
<i>You want me to entrust
the story of my life
to the quiet place.</i>

55:22.256 --> 55:23.890
He has some really nice shots

55:23.991 --> 55:25.192
on his Instagram.

55:25.292 --> 55:27.194
Come on, give him a chance, man.

55:27.294 --> 55:28.972
Maybe he speaks
the language of
cinema like you do.

55:28.996 --> 55:30.998
The guy never speaks at all.

55:31.098 --> 55:33.866
Okay, so we just
scouted in here,

55:33.968 --> 55:35.802
and the colors are fucking ugly.

55:35.903 --> 55:38.339
So silent Bob wants to
shoot the whole movie

55:38.439 --> 55:40.107
in black and white.

55:40.207 --> 55:42.943
<i>Schindler's list
black and white?
What, is he nuts?</i>

55:43.043 --> 55:45.145
Uh, no, I'm a fucking filmmaker.

55:45.246 --> 55:47.147
And any filmmaker
worth their salt

55:47.248 --> 55:48.716
would know that the colors

55:48.815 --> 55:50.251
in this place
are fucking ghastly.

55:50.351 --> 55:52.186
The only way
you could
deal with them

55:52.286 --> 55:54.097
is to neutralize
them by going in
black and white,

55:54.121 --> 55:55.956
which will also
kind of act as
a commentary

55:56.056 --> 55:58.392
on the soulless
nature of commerce

55:58.492 --> 56:01.595
while subliminally
giving the audience
the impression

56:01.695 --> 56:03.731
that they're watching our heroes

56:03.830 --> 56:05.132
from the perspective

56:05.232 --> 56:07.767
of an imaginary
store security cam.

56:08.936 --> 56:10.337
That's what
I was thinking.
Mmm-hmm.

56:10.437 --> 56:11.838
That's what
an artist thinks.
Yup.

56:11.939 --> 56:13.507
But, you know, it's up to you.

56:13.607 --> 56:16.210
However,
I'm shooting it
in black and white,

56:16.310 --> 56:18.512
or I ain't shooting
it at all,
motherfucker.

56:18.612 --> 56:20.014
That's right.

56:29.189 --> 56:31.692
<i>Jesus, he looks fat.</i>

56:31.791 --> 56:33.594
You're not on mute, Emma.

56:33.694 --> 56:36.896
<i>I know. So? Hello.</i>

56:36.997 --> 56:38.666
Hi, you.

56:38.766 --> 56:40.567
How's Florida?

56:40.668 --> 56:42.178
<i>Full of assholes,
but at least
it's not Jersey.</i>

56:42.202 --> 56:43.704
<i>What do you want, Dante?</i>

56:43.803 --> 56:47.041
Okay, uh, this is gonna
come out of left field,

56:47.141 --> 56:52.279
but, um, I was hoping
I could borrow some money.

56:52.379 --> 56:53.414
<i>Fuck no.</i>

56:53.514 --> 56:55.582
It's not for me.
It's for randal.

56:55.683 --> 56:58.252
<i>Oh, then double fuck no.</i>

56:58.352 --> 56:59.987
He had a heart attack, Emma.

57:00.087 --> 57:01.989
<i>Good. I hope
he dropped dead.</i>

57:02.589 --> 57:03.856
He didn't.

57:03.957 --> 57:05.892
So he needs the money for, uh...

57:05.993 --> 57:07.261
For the hospital bills.

57:07.361 --> 57:08.895
Randal doesn't have
any insurance.

57:08.996 --> 57:10.564
<i>So the fuck what?</i>

57:10.664 --> 57:12.766
<i>Even if I wanted to help,
which I don't,</i>

57:12.865 --> 57:15.669
<i>I'm not giving
randal graves
any free money.</i>

57:15.769 --> 57:17.438
Emma, please.

57:17.538 --> 57:19.516
You and I once
promised that if
we ever needed help,

57:19.540 --> 57:21.909
we'd always be there
for each other,
no matter what.

57:22.009 --> 57:24.478
<i>That was before
you cheated on me</i>

57:24.578 --> 57:27.081
<i>at a fucking donkey show.</i>

57:27.181 --> 57:28.515
<i>Goodbye, Dante!</i>

57:28.615 --> 57:31.485
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

57:31.585 --> 57:33.287
Please, Emma.

57:34.621 --> 57:36.889
I'm desperate here.

57:36.990 --> 57:38.692
<i>Do you even have any collateral?</i>

57:38.792 --> 57:41.295
If I have to...

57:41.395 --> 57:44.498
I can sign over my
half of the quickstop
as collateral.

57:44.598 --> 57:46.333
<i>That shithole? Ugh.</i>

57:53.374 --> 57:55.943
What's all this about?
We're making a movie.

57:56.043 --> 57:58.645
No shit.
A pornography movie?

57:58.746 --> 58:01.415
How long does
that take?
Twenty-one nights.

58:01.515 --> 58:04.017
It's gonna take
my auteur friend
here 21 nights

58:04.118 --> 58:06.553
for him to cinematically
suck his own dick.

58:06.653 --> 58:07.887

1:01:46.908 --> 1:01:48.875
Nice job, nice work.

1:01:48.977 --> 1:01:50.410
Um...

1:01:50.510 --> 1:01:51.654
All right,
we're doing
the same shot

1:01:51.678 --> 1:01:53.480
just over to this door.

1:01:53.580 --> 1:01:56.817
Sound here.
Let's get the
sticks over there.

1:01:56.918 --> 1:01:58.185
Elias, you with us?

1:01:58.285 --> 1:01:59.620
Okay, we're doing
the same thing.

1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:01.197
We're just, kind of,
coming over here.

1:02:01.221 --> 1:02:02.461
We're gonna stay on the same...

1:02:02.489 --> 1:02:03.890
<i>♪ Find your way back... ♪</i>

1:02:06.326 --> 1:02:08.562
And... action.

1:02:08.662 --> 1:02:13.034
You know, there are
a million fines
in the world, dude.

1:02:13.133 --> 1:02:15.335
"Millions
of fines"?
What the hell, man?

1:02:15.435 --> 1:02:16.938
That's not the line.

1:02:17.038 --> 1:02:19.339
"There's a million
fine-looking women

1:02:19.439 --> 1:02:21.274
"in the world,
dude."

1:02:21.375 --> 1:02:25.479
There are a billion
behinds in this
world, dude!

1:02:25.579 --> 1:02:28.649
Whoo!
Not "billions
of behinds."

1:02:28.749 --> 1:02:31.585
"A million
fine-looking
women."

1:02:31.685 --> 1:02:35.622
You know, they're
killing swines
in the world, dude.

1:02:35.722 --> 1:02:38.291
Jesus fucking Christ,
you non-acting fuck!

1:02:38.392 --> 1:02:40.494
I will do it myself.

1:02:41.062 --> 1:02:43.263
Ahem!

1:02:43.363 --> 1:02:45.133
You know,
there's a million
fine-looking women

1:02:45.232 --> 1:02:46.833
in the world, dude,

1:02:46.934 --> 1:02:49.202
but they don't
all bring you
lasagna at work.

1:02:49.302 --> 1:02:51.139
Most of them just cheat on you.

1:02:51.238 --> 1:02:54.008
<i>You all about
Eve -ining fuck.
Well?</i>

1:02:54.108 --> 1:02:56.810
Fasten your seatbelts.
It's gonna be
a bumpy night.

1:02:56.911 --> 1:02:59.147
So that's it.
He doesn't love
you anymore.

1:02:59.246 --> 1:03:00.681
He loves Caitlin.

1:03:00.781 --> 1:03:03.350
And he told
you all this?
Pretty much.

1:03:03.450 --> 1:03:05.485
All except the latent
homosexuality but...

1:03:05.585 --> 1:03:06.988
What the fuck, man?

1:03:07.088 --> 1:03:09.256
We're making
a movie here. Ew!

1:03:09.356 --> 1:03:12.292
It's nothing
compared to how
my cousin Walter died.

1:03:12.392 --> 1:03:14.929
- How'd he die?
- He broke his neck.

1:03:15.029 --> 1:03:16.630
That's embarrassing?

1:03:16.730 --> 1:03:18.865
He broke his neck
trying to suck
his own dick.

1:03:18.966 --> 1:03:20.267
Holy shit, man.

1:03:20.367 --> 1:03:22.636
- Is that shit true?
- Are you nuts?

1:03:22.736 --> 1:03:23.570
Shut the fuck up.

1:03:23.670 --> 1:03:25.205
We're shooting a scene here.

1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:43.657
<i>♪ I know it's too late now</i>

1:03:43.757 --> 1:03:48.096
<i>♪ but I wish I could
go back in time</i>

1:03:48.196 --> 1:03:51.898
<i>♪ and start all over somehow</i>

1:03:51.999 --> 1:03:55.535
<i>♪ and get it right
from the start</i>

1:03:55.635 --> 1:03:57.771
<i>♪ find your way back</i>

1:03:59.539 --> 1:04:02.342
<i>♪ find your way back

1:04:03.443 --> 1:04:04.979
<i>♪ find your way back ♪</i>

1:04:05.079 --> 1:04:06.713
Uh, what the hell is this?

1:04:06.813 --> 1:04:08.482
The story needs a little action

1:04:08.582 --> 1:04:09.917
so I added a scene where cohee

1:04:10.017 --> 1:04:12.220
comes in to
Rob the place
at the end.

1:04:12.319 --> 1:04:13.921
And in the process,
you get shot.

1:04:14.021 --> 1:04:16.991
No way. I'm not letting
you kill me off
in the third act.

1:04:17.091 --> 1:04:18.358
What if there's a sequel?

1:04:18.458 --> 1:04:20.894
A sequel?
What am I? A hack?

1:04:20.995 --> 1:04:25.332
Cohee, producer
says I gotta cut
your scene, man.

1:04:25.432 --> 1:04:27.434
Yo, I'm still pay
or play, right?

1:04:27.534 --> 1:04:30.004
Publicity? Isn't it
a little early for that?

1:04:30.104 --> 1:04:31.838
I've been
reading the paper
my whole life

1:04:31.939 --> 1:04:33.540
and the only time
I've seen my name in it

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:35.009
was under the headline,

1:04:35.109 --> 1:04:37.644
"local grocer has
massive heart attack."

1:04:37.744 --> 1:04:41.314
So I thought in your
official capacity
as producer,

1:04:41.414 --> 1:04:43.316
maybe you can get
a cub reporter
over here

1:04:43.416 --> 1:04:46.154
to do a story
about your director
in action.

1:04:49.322 --> 1:04:51.225
"I assure you
we're open."

1:04:51.324 --> 1:04:52.960
I don't get it.

1:04:53.060 --> 1:04:55.029
Some savages are
always sticking
gum in the locks,

1:04:55.129 --> 1:04:57.430
so I wrote it
into the script
to be the reason

1:04:57.531 --> 1:04:58.966
the shutters are closed all day.

1:04:59.066 --> 1:05:00.433
That way, we can shoot at night

1:05:00.534 --> 1:05:01.969
and pretend it's day out.

1:05:02.069 --> 1:05:04.972
I fucking hate
how fake
Hollywood is.

1:05:05.072 --> 1:05:08.042
I don't
appreciate
your ruse, ma'am.

1:05:08.142 --> 1:05:09.676
I beg your pardon.
Your ruse.

1:05:09.776 --> 1:05:12.213
Your cunning attempt
to trick me.

1:05:12.312 --> 1:05:14.314
This is the last
time I rent here!

1:05:14.414 --> 1:05:16.316
You will be missed.

1:05:16.416 --> 1:05:17.851
Screw you!

1:05:20.154 --> 1:05:22.856
You're not
allowed to rent
here anymore!

1:05:22.957 --> 1:05:24.058
Yeah!

1:05:24.158 --> 1:05:25.492
And cut.

1:05:29.596 --> 1:05:31.199
Nice work.

1:05:31.299 --> 1:05:32.566
Nice work.

1:05:32.666 --> 1:05:34.568
Okay, now just give
me ten minutes

1:05:34.668 --> 1:05:36.670
and then
I'll be ready
to do mine.

1:05:36.770 --> 1:05:37.838
Your what?

1:05:38.405 --> 1:05:40.874
Wah, Ricky!

1:05:40.975 --> 1:05:44.078
This is
the last time
I rent here!

1:05:48.216 --> 1:05:50.218
I don't get it.

1:05:50.318 --> 1:05:53.420
She wanted to do one as Lucy.

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:55.223
<i>Empire had the better ending.</i>

1:05:55.323 --> 1:05:56.683
I mean, Luke gets
his hand cut off,

1:05:56.723 --> 1:05:58.259
finds out vader's his father.

1:05:58.391 --> 1:05:59.802
Han gets frozen,
taken away by Boba Fett.

1:05:59.826 --> 1:06:01.561
It ends on such a down note.

1:06:01.661 --> 1:06:04.131
Cut.
What? What happened?

1:06:04.232 --> 1:06:05.432
"Han gets frozen

1:06:05.532 --> 1:06:07.734
"and taken away
by Boba Fett."

1:06:07.834 --> 1:06:08.869
I said that.

1:06:08.970 --> 1:06:10.570
No, you said, "han gets frozen,

1:06:10.670 --> 1:06:12.173
"taken away
by Boba Fett."

1:06:12.273 --> 1:06:13.273
You left out
the "and."

1:06:13.341 --> 1:06:14.574
Do I come in now, randal?

1:06:14.674 --> 1:06:17.078
Not yet, Thomas.
Go back out.

1:06:17.178 --> 1:06:19.412
You can blame Dante
for ad-libbing
all over my movie

1:06:19.512 --> 1:06:20.780
like he's Seth fucking rogan.

1:06:20.881 --> 1:06:22.782
Oh, my god, I left out one word.

1:06:22.883 --> 1:06:24.751
Every word is sacred
to the writer.

1:06:24.851 --> 1:06:26.586
This isn't writing.

1:06:26.686 --> 1:06:28.065
It's a bunch of shit
that happened
for real in my life.

1:06:28.089 --> 1:06:29.323
My life.

1:06:29.422 --> 1:06:30.724
Do I come in now, randal?

1:06:30.824 --> 1:06:32.692
Not yet, Thomas.
Back.

1:06:32.792 --> 1:06:35.462
Oh, man, Thomas fucked up again?

1:06:35.562 --> 1:06:37.231
Stop fucking shit up, Thomas.

1:06:37.331 --> 1:06:40.667
Hey, fuck-o.
What'd you say
to my father?

1:06:40.767 --> 1:06:41.969
How about I fuck your shit up,

1:06:42.069 --> 1:06:43.146
you fucking fuck
hole motherfucker!

1:06:43.170 --> 1:06:44.804
Shooter Bob!

1:06:45.805 --> 1:06:47.507
That is the Jersey-iest thing

1:06:47.607 --> 1:06:50.543
I've ever heard
or seen in
my life.

1:06:50.644 --> 1:06:52.846
And action.

1:06:54.081 --> 1:06:55.515
That's your lung.

1:06:55.615 --> 1:06:58.152
By this time,
your lung looks
like this.

1:06:59.452 --> 1:07:01.389
So why don't you put
the cigarettes back

1:07:01.488 --> 1:07:03.224
and try some gum instead?

1:07:03.324 --> 1:07:05.892
Here, chewlies gum, try this.

1:07:05.993 --> 1:07:08.095
Oh, my god, that reeks!

1:07:08.195 --> 1:07:09.863
God!
What is that?

1:07:09.964 --> 1:07:12.266
What happened
to the model of
the lung I gave ya?

1:07:12.366 --> 1:07:13.667
I'm a method actor.

1:07:13.767 --> 1:07:15.002
I ditched the model lung

1:07:15.102 --> 1:07:16.736
for this tripe
I got at foodtown.

1:07:16.836 --> 1:07:19.706
Jesus.
I used my power
of stagecraft

1:07:19.806 --> 1:07:22.575
to see that
stomach as a lung.
It's method!

1:07:22.676 --> 1:07:24.577
And you're Dante Hicks.

1:07:24.678 --> 1:07:27.315
We went to
the same school.
You played hockey.

1:07:27.415 --> 1:07:28.715
Yeah. How'd you
know that?

1:07:28.815 --> 1:07:30.384
You still going out with her?

1:07:30.483 --> 1:07:31.685
No, she's getting married.

1:07:31.785 --> 1:07:33.421
To you?
No.

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:35.323
To an Asian design major.

1:07:35.423 --> 1:07:36.991
What is...
You know what?

1:07:37.091 --> 1:07:40.428
Cut, cut, cut!
I can't abide
by this racist shit.

1:07:40.527 --> 1:07:42.796
Racist? How the
hell is it racist?

1:07:42.896 --> 1:07:44.864
Just look at all
this fucking
lack of diversity.

1:07:44.966 --> 1:07:49.303
And calling some
guy an Asian
design major

1:07:49.403 --> 1:07:51.038
just feels racist.

1:07:51.138 --> 1:07:55.276
That's not racist.
The guy literally
majored in Asian design.

1:07:55.376 --> 1:07:57.178
Are you sure?

1:07:57.278 --> 1:07:59.813
Wasn't he a, uh, Asian
student who was also
a design major?

1:07:59.914 --> 1:08:03.951
He was a passionate
student of Asian design.

1:08:04.051 --> 1:08:07.754
It just so happens
he himself was
coincidentally Asian.

1:08:10.790 --> 1:08:12.293
Take it easy, man.

1:08:14.228 --> 1:08:16.529
So, uh, where are
we gonna shoot the
donkey show scene?

1:08:16.629 --> 1:08:18.498
Where it happened.
Mooby's.

1:08:18.598 --> 1:08:19.967
Our mooby's?
Yeah.

1:08:20.067 --> 1:08:21.835
How are we supposed to get in?

1:08:21.936 --> 1:08:24.671
I got the locations
department
working on it.

1:08:24.771 --> 1:08:27.640
It's stuck in my hair.

1:08:27.741 --> 1:08:30.244
Shit. Can you
get it?

1:08:30.344 --> 1:08:33.847

the mooby suit, man.

1:10:44.979 --> 1:10:47.515
Don't even
think words!
Uh...

1:10:47.615 --> 1:10:48.992
We're gonna shoot
a movie in a minute

1:10:49.016 --> 1:10:50.317
so I gotta chase you guys

1:10:50.417 --> 1:10:51.784
- out of here.
- Oh, okay, my bad.

1:10:51.885 --> 1:10:53.187
I guess you don't want press

1:10:53.287 --> 1:10:54.431
for your little
YouTube video, then.

1:10:54.455 --> 1:10:55.589
Did you say press?

1:10:55.688 --> 1:10:57.024
Mr. Dante
asked them

1:10:57.124 --> 1:10:58.459
to come here to cover the shoot.

1:10:58.559 --> 1:11:00.594
So you're saying
little Lisa is...

1:11:00.693 --> 1:11:03.164
Ah! High school Lisa.

1:11:03.264 --> 1:11:04.764
Don't call her little Lisa

1:11:04.864 --> 1:11:06.400
and you better not
call me big Lisa.

1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:10.104
High school Lisa
writes for the high
school newspaper?

1:11:10.204 --> 1:11:12.306
And her parents
are the chaperones.

1:11:12.406 --> 1:11:13.941
Fucking great.

1:11:14.041 --> 1:11:15.352
Even though
one parent
just came out

1:11:15.376 --> 1:11:16.944
of the strip club tonight

1:11:17.044 --> 1:11:20.047
spending all my $5 bills
that I got at bingo. Bitch.

1:11:22.216 --> 1:11:24.717
Hey! The producer's
on set.

1:11:24.817 --> 1:11:28.189
So lights! Camera!

1:11:28.289 --> 1:11:29.822
Action!

1:11:29.924 --> 1:11:31.592
He looks drunk.

1:11:31.691 --> 1:11:33.893
He looks like
he needs a piece
of butter and bread.

1:11:37.031 --> 1:11:38.632
Ooh, it's cold in here.

1:11:38.731 --> 1:11:40.700
Cough cold... hey!

1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:42.203
All right, look,

1:11:42.303 --> 1:11:44.704
I realize going to mooby's
might have hit you hard

1:11:44.804 --> 1:11:46.140
but you just take off?

1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:48.509
We couldn't even shoot
the donkey show!

1:11:48.609 --> 1:11:49.776
Oh, big deal.

1:11:49.876 --> 1:11:51.579
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

1:11:51.679 --> 1:11:55.449
Try thinking of somebody
other than yourself for once.

1:11:55.549 --> 1:11:57.051
Myself?
Okay.

1:11:57.151 --> 1:11:58.818
We're gonna shoot this scene

1:11:58.919 --> 1:12:00.719
because the kid from
the high school newspaper

1:12:00.753 --> 1:12:02.323
and her mom are waiting.

1:12:02.423 --> 1:12:04.791
Thanks for understanding
the assignment on that one.

1:12:04.891 --> 1:12:06.627
But since you
showed up here
shit-faced

1:12:06.726 --> 1:12:09.363
and ruined tonight
before we even had
a chance to roll,

1:12:09.463 --> 1:12:11.864
we're gonna
re-shoot this tomorrow.

1:12:11.966 --> 1:12:14.734
So get your selfish ass
out there on that cooler

1:12:14.834 --> 1:12:16.136
and let's pretend for a minute

1:12:16.237 --> 1:12:18.672
you've actually
been helpful
on my movie,

1:12:18.771 --> 1:12:20.040
which is, like, the only thing

1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:21.976
I ever asked you to do for me

1:12:22.076 --> 1:12:24.011
and only after I almost
dropped dead

1:12:24.111 --> 1:12:26.714
from a fucking heart attack.

1:12:26.813 --> 1:12:29.149
You're fucking
unbelievable, man.

1:12:29.250 --> 1:12:30.517
Come on!

1:12:38.959 --> 1:12:40.160
What...

1:12:42.029 --> 1:12:43.863
<i>In convenience.</i>

1:12:43.964 --> 1:12:45.432
Stupid title.

1:12:45.532 --> 1:12:48.335
Scene 137.
Take one.

1:12:48.435 --> 1:12:50.337
Are they shooting this
in black and white?

1:12:50.437 --> 1:12:53.040
I see a lot of white.
I don't see the black.

1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:55.342
And action.

1:12:55.442 --> 1:12:58.212
<i>♪ Da-dum, da-dum...</i>

1:12:58.312 --> 1:13:00.180
<i>♪ Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum</i>

1:13:00.281 --> 1:13:02.583
<i>♪ da-dum, da-dum
da-dum, dadum... ♪</i>

1:13:02.683 --> 1:13:04.652
<i>Salsa shark!</i>

1:13:04.752 --> 1:13:06.253
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

1:13:08.055 --> 1:13:11.225
Man goes into cage,
cage goes into salsa.

1:13:11.325 --> 1:13:14.128
Shark's in the salsa.
Our shark.

1:13:15.895 --> 1:13:17.564
Oh, what?
What's with you, man?

1:13:17.665 --> 1:13:19.600
You haven't said
anything in,
like, 20 minutes.

1:13:19.700 --> 1:13:21.268
What the hell's your problem?

1:13:21.368 --> 1:13:22.569
This life.

1:13:22.670 --> 1:13:24.837
This life?

1:13:24.938 --> 1:13:27.574
I'm stuck in this pit
on my day off,

1:13:27.675 --> 1:13:31.645
dealing with every backward
ass fuck on the planet.

1:13:31.745 --> 1:13:33.681
I smell like shoe Polish,

1:13:33.781 --> 1:13:36.183
and my girlfriend
sucked 36 dicks.

1:13:36.283 --> 1:13:37.618
- Thirty-seven.
- Oh!

1:13:37.718 --> 1:13:39.186
Cover your ears, baby girl.

1:13:39.286 --> 1:13:40.954
Why the fuck
are they cursing
like that?

1:13:41.055 --> 1:13:43.223
You need to shit
or get off the pot.

1:13:43.324 --> 1:13:44.992
What the hell
are you talking about?

1:13:45.092 --> 1:13:46.572
I'm talking about
this thing you have,

1:13:46.627 --> 1:13:49.129
this inability
to improve your
station in life.

1:13:49.229 --> 1:13:50.297
Fuck you.

1:13:50.397 --> 1:13:51.799
It's true, man.

1:13:51.898 --> 1:13:54.201
You sit there and
blame life for dealin'
ya a cruddy hand,

1:13:54.301 --> 1:13:56.136
never once
accepting
responsibility

1:13:56.236 --> 1:13:58.072
for the way your situation is.

1:13:58.172 --> 1:14:00.274
You better leave me
the fuck alone, man.

1:14:00.374 --> 1:14:02.042
It's because
you're comfortable,
right?

1:14:02.142 --> 1:14:03.553
This is the life of
convenience for you

1:14:03.577 --> 1:14:05.512
and any attempt
to change it
would shatter

1:14:05.612 --> 1:14:07.880
the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned
for yourself.

1:14:07.981 --> 1:14:09.316
What?

1:14:09.416 --> 1:14:11.016
Man, if you
weren't such
a fucking coward.

1:14:11.085 --> 1:14:13.420
Oh, would you shut the fuck up?

1:14:14.887 --> 1:14:17.091
That's not the line, man.

1:14:17.191 --> 1:14:18.926
What are you doing?
My whole life

1:14:19.026 --> 1:14:21.362
you've been running
your mouth a million
miles an hour

1:14:21.462 --> 1:14:23.464
and saying absolutely nothing!

1:14:25.099 --> 1:14:26.400
I gotta listen to you talk shit

1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:28.602
about everybody
and everything
you think

1:14:28.702 --> 1:14:31.672
as if the world's waiting
for you to weigh in!

1:14:31.772 --> 1:14:34.007
Nobody fuckin' cares.

1:14:34.108 --> 1:14:35.509
Oh, real nice, pal.

1:14:35.609 --> 1:14:37.220
Get me all worked up
because it's not like

1:14:37.244 --> 1:14:38.612
I had a heart attack
and almost...

1:14:38.712 --> 1:14:42.316
Died! "I almost died
from a heart attack!

1:14:42.416 --> 1:14:45.085
"Did I not mention
that a couple of
thousand times yet?"

1:14:45.185 --> 1:14:48.088
Fuck you.
"Hey, everybody,
look at me.

1:14:48.188 --> 1:14:49.623
"I'm the boy who lived."

1:14:50.924 --> 1:14:52.559
"So I gotta make a movie

1:14:52.659 --> 1:14:54.695
"all about what
a relentless fucking
asshole I am

1:14:54.795 --> 1:14:56.130
"to everybody I ever met,

1:14:56.230 --> 1:14:58.599
"especially my so-called
fucking friends."

1:14:58.699 --> 1:15:00.401
Oh, we're not friends
anymore, man.

1:15:00.501 --> 1:15:02.035
You can fucking
believe that shit.

1:15:02.136 --> 1:15:03.337
Oh, good!
Yeah.

1:15:03.437 --> 1:15:05.372
Because if we're not friends,

1:15:05.472 --> 1:15:08.175
I don't have to worry
anymore what
the cold, hard truth

1:15:08.275 --> 1:15:10.244
might do to your poor,
wittle heart!

1:15:10.344 --> 1:15:12.980
Oh, don't worry
about me, pal,
I'll be just fine.

1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:14.248
So since I can be completely

1:15:14.348 --> 1:15:15.749
honest with you?
Oh, please,

1:15:15.849 --> 1:15:17.518
be completely honest.

1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:22.222
You think you deserve a movie?

1:15:22.322 --> 1:15:23.624
Yeah.

1:15:23.724 --> 1:15:27.161
What did you
ever do in life
but watch it

1:15:27.261 --> 1:15:28.896
and mock it?

1:15:28.996 --> 1:15:31.398
What have you ever fucking done?

1:15:31.498 --> 1:15:33.066
I had a life.

1:15:34.635 --> 1:15:37.037
I was this close
to happily ever after

1:15:37.137 --> 1:15:40.707
and then, one drunk
driver later...

1:15:42.042 --> 1:15:43.410
My movie's over.

1:15:44.311 --> 1:15:45.379
Forever.

1:15:46.947 --> 1:15:48.615
No happy ending,

1:15:48.715 --> 1:15:50.517
no sequel.

1:15:50.617 --> 1:15:52.653
Not even a third fucking act,

1:15:52.753 --> 1:15:56.023
just, "fuck you!
And, oh, by the way,

1:15:56.123 --> 1:15:59.326
"fuck you!" Credits.

1:16:01.061 --> 1:16:02.396
But, hey...

1:16:03.397 --> 1:16:05.799
What's that compared
to a heart attack?

1:16:05.899 --> 1:16:08.068
I mean, shit!

1:16:08.168 --> 1:16:10.604
You could have
almost died, right?

1:16:10.704 --> 1:16:12.072
Yeah.

1:16:12.172 --> 1:16:14.141
Well, some of us did die.

1:16:16.677 --> 1:16:19.713
Some of us have
been dead inside
ever since.

1:16:19.813 --> 1:16:23.350
But then, just when
I'm able to walk
into this place

1:16:23.450 --> 1:16:27.588
without wanting to
kill myself every day,
you have an idea.

1:16:28.722 --> 1:16:30.691
You wanna make a movie
about your life.

1:16:30.791 --> 1:16:33.727
Oh, and you...
You've been very
clear about that.

1:16:34.695 --> 1:16:36.096
It's your life!

1:16:37.598 --> 1:16:40.868
Well, get this,
you self-centered,

1:16:40.969 --> 1:16:42.302
gaping wound of a human being

1:16:42.402 --> 1:16:44.738
with your insatiable
fucking ego!

1:16:44.838 --> 1:16:46.607
The fuck?

1:16:46.707 --> 1:16:48.041
Your life...

1:16:49.076 --> 1:16:50.577
Is my life!

1:16:51.913 --> 1:16:55.349
I've been
there with you
the whole time!

1:16:57.618 --> 1:17:01.088
And since you know
how hard that life's
been on me,

1:17:01.990 --> 1:17:04.458
did it ever occur to you

1:17:04.558 --> 1:17:08.195
that maybe I didn't wanna
relive that fucking life?

1:17:10.864 --> 1:17:12.099
So, I quit...

1:17:12.866 --> 1:17:14.401
As your producer.

1:17:16.136 --> 1:17:17.671
And I quit...

1:17:19.106 --> 1:17:21.208
As your fucking friend.

1:17:24.545 --> 1:17:27.147
'Cause I'm not
even supposed to...

1:17:31.552 --> 1:17:34.054
Now that's what I call acting!

1:17:34.154 --> 1:17:37.025
Come on, everybody,
clap it up for that.

1:17:37.124 --> 1:17:39.793
Okay, drinkie-mc-stinky, get up.

1:17:42.030 --> 1:17:43.297
Dante?

1:17:44.431 --> 1:17:45.432
Hey.

1:17:46.066 --> 1:17:49.770
Hey. Hey! Dante!

1:17:49.870 --> 1:17:51.104
Wake up, man. Hey!

1:17:51.204 --> 1:17:52.506
Call an ambulance!

1:17:52.606 --> 1:17:55.309
<i>Wake up, man.
Dante. Dante!</i>

1:17:58.947 --> 1:18:00.949
Dante? Um...

1:18:01.049 --> 1:18:02.482
Excuse me. We're...
What the...

1:18:02.583 --> 1:18:04.060
No, you can't be
back here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:18:04.084 --> 1:18:06.286
All right,
already. God.

1:18:06.386 --> 1:18:07.597
They just brought our friend in.

1:18:07.621 --> 1:18:09.489
His name is Dante Hicks.

1:18:09.590 --> 1:18:11.267
He's the drunk guy
that collapsed
at the quickstop.

1:18:11.291 --> 1:18:12.726
Uh-huh.
The first
responder said

1:18:12.826 --> 1:18:14.306
he's having
a heart attack.
Okay, okay.

1:18:14.394 --> 1:18:15.572
You need to wait out there, sir.

1:18:15.596 --> 1:18:16.956
Someone will be by
to tell you more

1:18:16.998 --> 1:18:18.165
as soon as we know more.

1:18:20.034 --> 1:18:21.234
Thank you.

1:18:23.637 --> 1:18:26.273
This is where
I first rejected Jesus.

1:18:26.373 --> 1:18:29.376
Yeah, and now look
what's happened.

1:18:29.476 --> 1:18:31.012
So weird to be back here.

1:18:31.111 --> 1:18:33.313
Yeah, tell me about it.

1:18:33.413 --> 1:18:35.682
All right, look.
I'm gonna get
out of here.

1:18:35.782 --> 1:18:38.151
Call me as soon
as they say something,
all right?

1:18:38.251 --> 1:18:39.653
Wait, what?
Where are you going?

1:18:39.753 --> 1:18:42.623
I'm gonna go work
on my movie, man.

1:18:42.723 --> 1:18:43.624
Your movie?

1:18:43.724 --> 1:18:45.525
Yeah, I mean, it's almost done.

1:18:45.626 --> 1:18:47.503
It's not like I'm doing
Dante any good
sitting around here.

1:18:47.527 --> 1:18:49.496
I might as well
go work on my movie.

1:18:49.596 --> 1:18:51.933
Are you kidding me?
Even now?

1:18:52.033 --> 1:18:54.002
"Even now" what?

1:18:54.102 --> 1:18:55.402
"Oh, my movie.

1:18:55.502 --> 1:18:57.537
"My movie!
Everybody make
my movie

1:18:57.638 --> 1:18:59.406
"because it's
so important."

1:18:59.506 --> 1:19:01.541
This is neither
the time nor the place

1:19:01.642 --> 1:19:03.410
to do an impression
of Chris Nolan.

1:19:03.510 --> 1:19:05.412
I'm doing
an impression
of you, randal.

1:19:05.512 --> 1:19:06.847
We're in the hospital.

1:19:06.948 --> 1:19:08.916
That's stating
the obvious.
No.

1:19:09.017 --> 1:19:11.184
The obvious statement
right now would be,

1:19:11.284 --> 1:19:12.586
"never mind the movie,

1:19:12.686 --> 1:19:14.321
"my best friend's

1:19:14.421 --> 1:19:18.191
It's just a heart attack.
I had one. He'll be fine.

1:19:18.291 --> 1:19:20.494
Fuck you, randal.

1:19:20.594 --> 1:19:21.828

1:19:21.929 --> 1:19:23.497

God, man.

1:19:23.597 --> 1:19:25.599
I used to look up to you so much

1:19:25.699 --> 1:19:28.102
but you're the worst,
you know that?

1:19:28.201 --> 1:19:29.469
The worst in the world.

1:19:29.569 --> 1:19:32.839
Mr. Dante made
your movie happen.

1:19:32.940 --> 1:19:35.076
I made my movie happen.

1:19:35.175 --> 1:19:37.644
I had the idea
to make the movie.

1:19:37.744 --> 1:19:38.946
I wrote the script

1:19:39.047 --> 1:19:40.814
and I'm the goddamn director.

1:19:40.915 --> 1:19:42.716
I made this movie happen.

1:19:42.816 --> 1:19:44.317
It was all me.

1:19:44.418 --> 1:19:47.155
Oh, it was
all you, huh?
Yeah.

1:19:47.254 --> 1:19:48.588
Okay.

1:19:49.656 --> 1:19:51.825
Take off your stupid
mask, randal.

1:19:52.659 --> 1:19:54.294
Yeah.

1:19:54.394 --> 1:19:56.596
Because I remember
Mr. Dante
doing everything.

1:19:56.697 --> 1:20:00.333
He even called
his ex-fiancee
who hates his guts.

1:20:00.434 --> 1:20:03.004
He put up his half of quickstop

1:20:03.104 --> 1:20:06.074
just to get you
the money to make
your stupid movie.

1:20:06.174 --> 1:20:07.541
Wait a minute.

1:20:07.641 --> 1:20:09.710
Dante got the money
for my movie from Emma?

1:20:09.810 --> 1:20:11.378
<i>Code blue. Er 7.</i>

1:20:11.478 --> 1:20:13.413
Dante, I didn't know about Emma.

1:20:13.513 --> 1:20:14.824
I just found out.
You again?
What did I say?

1:20:14.848 --> 1:20:16.208
I didn't know.
What did I say, huh?

1:20:16.249 --> 1:20:17.451
Security!
Is he okay?

1:20:17.551 --> 1:20:18.711
Get out of here,
man. Get out!

1:20:18.785 --> 1:20:21.288
Is he okay?
Get out! Security!

1:20:21.388 --> 1:20:23.523
All right.
Get off of me!

And that's when
the good thief said,

1:28:03.250 --> 1:28:07.321
"Jesus did no wrong,
whereas we are
but thieves."

1:28:08.855 --> 1:28:10.324

1:28:10.424 --> 1:28:11.858
I don't know

know this

1:28:11.959 --> 1:28:15.596
but I'm a satanist now.

1:28:15.695 --> 1:28:18.199
And while I may be
the devil's concubine,

1:28:18.999 --> 1:28:20.867
I still believe in heaven.

1:28:20.968 --> 1:28:22.970
And because
Mr. Dante

1:28:23.070 --> 1:28:25.506
was the best person
that I ever knew,

1:28:25.606 --> 1:28:27.740
I believe
he's in heaven
right now,

1:28:28.741 --> 1:28:30.311
just like the good thief.

1:28:32.613 --> 1:28:34.048

1:29:05.679 --> 1:29:09.583
I, uh...

1:29:09.683 --> 1:29:13.120
I thought a lot about
what to say here today.

1:29:13.220 --> 1:29:14.854
I was gonna pull from the eulogy

1:29:14.955 --> 1:29:18.192
<i>that kirk gave Spock
in the wrath of Khan,</i>

1:29:18.292 --> 1:29:20.194
<i>but I've always
been more of
a star wars fan</i>

1:29:20.294 --> 1:29:22.563
so I should say something like,

1:29:22.663 --> 1:29:26.899
"may the force be with you"
or "this is the way."

1:29:28.068 --> 1:29:29.737
But I think instead
of quoting a movie,

1:29:29.836 --> 1:29:32.506
I'd like to paraphrase
the departed.

1:29:32.606 --> 1:29:34.942
And by the departed,
I mean Dante Hicks,

1:29:35.042 --> 1:29:37.511
not the scorsese picture
that was pretty perfect

1:29:37.611 --> 1:29:40.481
right up until that
stupid shot of the rat
at the end.

1:29:42.916 --> 1:29:45.486
So in the words...

1:29:45.586 --> 1:29:47.988
Of the best guy I ever knew...

1:29:51.125 --> 1:29:54.028

Mr. Dante's spot.

1:30:22.923 --> 1:30:24.458
Yeah, well, after all this time

1:30:24.558 --> 1:30:27.227

1:30:27.328 --> 1:30:29.296
I'd say you earned it.

1:30:29.396 --> 1:30:30.974
Besides, I told you
way back when
we worked at mooby's

1:30:30.998 --> 1:30:32.299

1:30:32.399 --> 1:30:33.866

else am I gonna

1:30:38.272 --> 1:30:39.573

I not surprised?

1:30:52.686 --> 1:30:54.955
I was surprised
to see you
at the cemetery.

1:30:55.055 --> 1:30:56.757
You flew up for Dante?

1:30:56.856 --> 1:31:00.527
Well, I did almost
marry the man,
and if I had... p.S.

1:31:00.627 --> 1:31:02.529
He wouldn't have died
of a heart attack

1:31:02.629 --> 1:31:04.064

1:31:04.164 --> 1:31:06.233
Yeah, because
after a year
with you,

1:31:06.333 --> 1:31:07.901
he'd have killed himself.

1:31:08.001 --> 1:31:10.671

of your entirely
unwelcome visit?

1:31:29.857 --> 1:31:33.460
I loaned Dante 30 grand

1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:37.998
and he put his half
of the store up
as collateral.

1:31:38.098 --> 1:31:39.833

1:31:39.933 --> 1:31:43.904

Here's your sucking

1:32:48.735 --> 1:32:51.538
Well played, clerks.

of money.

1:33:09.490 --> 1:33:10.891
You wanna buy some weed?

1:33:10.991 --> 1:33:12.759
Yes! I wanna buy

1:33:14.194 --> 1:33:15.496
Whoo! That's gonna
get you higher

1:33:18.031 --> 1:33:20.367
Yo, where those kites at?

1:33:20.467 --> 1:33:23.003

It was shot on black

1:38:15.495 --> 1:38:17.735
<i>I said, "yeah,
I worked in a bunch

"would you be

1:38:24.671 --> 1:38:26.083
<i>And, uh, famous last
words because it...</i>

1:38:26.107 --> 1:38:27.674
<i>It was a convenience store job.</i>

1:38:27.774 --> 1:38:29.776
