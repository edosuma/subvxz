WEBVTT

00:04.120 --> 00:06.276
So I tell this guy there are
three rules for married men.

00:06.300 --> 00:07.146
- Just three?
- Yeah.

00:07.170 --> 00:09.700
One: Pretend to listen,
even when you're not.

00:09.730 --> 00:12.246
Two: Pretend to care,
even when you don't.

00:12.270 --> 00:16.190
And three: Pretend to be generous with
the things that you don't care about.

00:16.630 --> 00:19.086
I tell this guy,"Do you want
to have a happy marriage?

00:19.110 --> 00:21.080
You stick to those
rules, no matter what."

00:21.510 --> 00:23.436
How is your ex-wife, Eddie?

00:23.460 --> 00:26.206
- She's pretending to hate my guts.
- Come on! Tommy, hold on.

00:26.230 --> 00:28.106
Tommy, careful! Not so fast.

00:28.130 --> 00:32.916
Oh, I'm so sorry. I... I said, be careful.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.826
Sorry, Mister.

00:34.850 --> 00:37.946
- It's okay, kid.
- I'm sorry.

00:37.970 --> 00:39.706
Ma'am.

00:39.730 --> 00:42.226
Tommy, I told you to slow down.
I need you to be more careful.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.420
I'm sorry.

00:55.030 --> 01:01.410
* Beautiful dreamer Wake on to me *

01:19.190 --> 01:23.150
I said, stay down! Don't move!

01:58.250 --> 02:00.856
I am very impressed. Gymnastics?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.226
Yeah. For years.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.556
Where?

02:03.580 --> 02:05.866
In Japan, Germany, all
across the country.

02:05.890 --> 02:08.116
- Really?
- Yup.

02:08.139 --> 02:10.205
I've traveled extensively, too.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.096
Tony's still hitting
on the new recruits, huh?

02:12.120 --> 02:15.346
Ignorant, hopeful and eager to please.

02:15.370 --> 02:16.686
Yeah. What recruit isn't?

02:16.710 --> 02:18.300
I was not talking about the recruit.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.930
Sounds great.

02:21.190 --> 02:24.826
Gymnastics. What?

02:24.850 --> 02:27.526
You know, there are rules
about harassment, Tony.

02:27.550 --> 02:32.850
Well, then, maybe I should keep the number that
she just gave me in case I want to file a claim?

02:32.880 --> 02:35.576
You are fortunate recruits are
not allowed to carry guns, Tony.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.690
I don't know if you've noticed, Ziva, but
she and they don't exactly want to shoot me.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.370
Give 'em time.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.586
Look, one more week, they're out of our
hair and off to FLETC for three months.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.786
Why don't you let them focus on
learning how to be an NCIS agent?

02:47.810 --> 02:51.410
Well, you see, since Team Gibbs
was not assigned a recruit,

02:51.490 --> 02:56.270
I am just doing my best to teach and
inspire where I can, when I can, McKilljoy.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.320
It is curious we were
not assigned any recruit.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.320
It's the one-probie
rule, and we've got ours.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.480
Well, I, for one, feel
that we dodged a bullet.

03:03.510 --> 03:06.166
We don't want to let some
newbie get in our way, you know?

03:06.190 --> 03:08.006
I heard rumors that
Gibbs refuses to take one.

03:08.030 --> 03:10.516
Wrong. They won't give
him one. Think about it.

03:10.540 --> 03:14.766
You take a date back to your family's house, you want
to make a good impression, you want them to like you.

03:14.790 --> 03:18.150
You don't introduce them to your weird
Uncle Jethro until, like, the fifth date.

03:18.180 --> 03:20.400
Since when you an expert
on fifth dates, DiNozzo?

03:20.430 --> 03:21.626
You're very right about that, boss.

03:21.650 --> 03:23.426
Bank guard shot dead in Quantico.

03:23.450 --> 03:24.096
Quantico?

03:24.120 --> 03:27.020
Yeah, you heard right, McGee. Let's go.

03:29.090 --> 03:31.010
Bye, Tony.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.946
- There you go.
- Appreciate it, Tommy.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.140
Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.030
Ray Vittorio, bank guard.

03:51.370 --> 03:53.020
Weapon is still holstered.

03:53.050 --> 03:54.286
Never gave him a chance.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.010
To shoot?

03:56.040 --> 03:57.640
Surrender.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.710
It's no mystery what killed him.

03:59.750 --> 04:03.320
You know, when I was younger, I used to
take solace when the victim was elderly.

04:03.350 --> 04:10.270
I thought, well, at least he's had a full life, but
now that I am older, I don't get the same solace.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.760
Apparently, no one actually
saw the guard get shot.

04:13.790 --> 04:16.016
They all had their faces
buried in the carpet.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.829
Bank manager saw him walk into
the bathroom before the robbery.

04:18.860 --> 04:21.480
Steps back out, and, bam, falls here.

04:21.510 --> 04:22.626
How much they take?

04:22.650 --> 04:25.240
This branch just
received a money delivery.

04:25.270 --> 04:27.386
Paul Harris, corporate security.

04:27.410 --> 04:29.756
They took $27,000.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.290
Could have been worse.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.430
Not for him.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.676
Sorry. Of course. I didn't mean that.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.080
This bank ever been hit before?

04:36.110 --> 04:38.456
No, no. Never. This is Quantico.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.516
I mean, come on. It's a freaking Marine
base that houses the FBI Academy.

04:43.540 --> 04:44.796
Security cameras?

04:44.820 --> 04:47.270
I'll get the footage to
your office right away.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.246
Ziva, DiNozzo, witness statements.

04:49.270 --> 04:52.180
On it, boss.

04:54.630 --> 04:56.576
I thought they were
going to kill us all.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.630
I mean, they train us for this, but...

05:00.510 --> 05:01.506
Two guys.

05:01.530 --> 05:03.706
Ski masks, automatic weapons.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.440
Maybe Glocks, sir.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.006
They were barking orders.

05:07.030 --> 05:09.030
All business.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.096
Definitely three of them.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.590
Big guys.

05:11.620 --> 05:12.666
Guns?

05:12.690 --> 05:14.336
Big guns.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.480
I only saw one.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.410
There could have been more.

05:17.730 --> 05:20.056
Car?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.706
Dark sedan?

05:21.730 --> 05:23.346
I think it was a pickup.

05:23.370 --> 05:25.286
It was a red pickup.

05:25.310 --> 05:27.906
Or orange, maybe.

05:27.930 --> 05:29.460
It was a white SUV.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.726
I got a good look at it.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.980
You ever shoot anybody, Mister?

05:46.020 --> 05:48.290
Thanks, Jethro.

05:51.080 --> 05:54.156
Best guess... two bad guys in the
bank, a third one driving, boss.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.566
Possibly a white SUV.

05:55.590 --> 05:56.496
I put out a BOLO.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.776
There's two gates leading
in and out of Quantico.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.096
Both of them were closed down
within minutes of the robbery.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.710
Not enough time to make it out.

06:02.750 --> 06:07.386
What kind of idiots rob a bank with
thousands of Marines and half the FBI around?

06:07.410 --> 06:09.916
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- White Chevy Suburban.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.666
- Where?
- Main gate.

06:11.690 --> 06:14.390
White Chevy Suburban, east of
the main gate, perimeter road.

06:14.420 --> 06:17.020
You two, go.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.940
The suspects may be on the move.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.576
Getaway car didn't leave the base.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.076
Not idiots.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.240
Pros.

06:49.110 --> 06:50.550
I do not understand.

06:50.580 --> 06:54.830
If witnesses do not get a good look at
something, why do they talk out of their ass?

06:55.230 --> 06:56.376
Talking out of one's ass.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.220
That would be your
area of expertise, Tony.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.536
I'm gonna let you answer that query.

06:59.560 --> 07:04.920
Well, the general public is about as observant
as your average probie or new recruit.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.456
I'm a trained eye.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.446
I know every inch of my environment.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.566
Is that a fact?

07:09.590 --> 07:11.406
That's a fact.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.900
Jack.

07:15.470 --> 07:16.520
What do we know?

07:16.550 --> 07:19.620
Bank robbery occurred moments
after an armored car delivery.

07:19.660 --> 07:20.616
What does that suggest?

07:20.640 --> 07:21.646
Perfect timing.

07:21.670 --> 07:22.776
A little too perfect.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.500
Denzel Washington, Clive Owen.

07:24.530 --> 07:28.136
Inside man did an inside job.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.380
Director Vance, I was just...

07:31.410 --> 07:36.806
Explaining your theory of theft in the
workplace, which is certainly an epidemic.

07:36.830 --> 07:39.286
And very wrong.

07:39.310 --> 07:42.976
This is Agent Dwayne Wilson,
one of the new recruits.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.770
He was assigned to the fraud
unit for his two-week visit,

07:45.800 --> 07:48.206
but he's a former Marine
stationed at Quantico.

07:48.230 --> 07:49.570
Thought he might be helpful.

07:49.610 --> 07:52.996
So I've temporarily
reassigned him to your team.

07:53.020 --> 07:55.836
That's great. Welcome aboard.

07:55.860 --> 07:59.210
Thanks.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.140
Thank you.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.586
So, Dwayne, have you been
briefed on this case?

08:09.610 --> 08:11.526
Director Vance gave me
some of the particulars.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.050
And you heard Tony's inside-job theory.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.526
The problem with Tony's theory
is they only got $27,000.

08:18.550 --> 08:22.040
It seems like a lot of effort
for such a little reward.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.576
Maybe that's as much as
the bank holds in cash.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.066
- Did you think to ask?
- Did you?

08:25.090 --> 08:25.917
- Did you?
- You?

08:25.941 --> 08:29.416
If they waited three days, it
would have made a big difference.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.216
Holiday weekend for the base.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.535
Lot of Marines withdraw
cash for a weekend getaway.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.936
We're talking hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.250
Well, you'd think an
insider would've known that.

08:44.570 --> 08:49.806
Dwayne, crime scene photos.
Abby's lab. Go. Now!

08:49.830 --> 08:52.910
Yes, sir.

08:54.410 --> 08:57.580
Where is Abby's lab?

09:07.050 --> 09:09.036
Oh, boss, got the security
footage of the bank robbery.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.476
Put it up.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.090
You're looking at it.

09:14.170 --> 09:16.286
- What? That's it?
- Digital artifacts.

09:16.310 --> 09:20.500
I've tried to reconstruct the
image, but it's too far gone. Watch.

09:23.200 --> 09:28.276
Starts here. Ends here.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.966
They were extremely fast.

09:29.990 --> 09:33.386
Knew how to disable the cameras, were
in and out of the bank in 93 seconds.

09:33.410 --> 09:34.686
Fix it, McGee.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.246
I can't. It's gone.

09:36.270 --> 09:38.286
What... What do you mean, it's gone?

09:38.310 --> 09:43.086
The bank uses cameras that transmit their signals
through a computer network to a central security company.

09:43.110 --> 09:46.640
I searched through access logs.
I searched through keystroke logs.

09:48.010 --> 09:52.136
No one accessed the security
system at the time it went down.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.636
Owner of the getaway car was a 64-year-old
secretary by the name of Patsy Kipp.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.960
She reported the SUV
stolen five days ago.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.200
Long time to hang on to a stolen car.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.580
I'm thinking this isnot
an inside job, boss.

10:03.610 --> 10:05.056
If these guys had waited
another three days,

10:05.080 --> 10:08.520
they would've gotten away with the big
weekend cash delivery... over 600 grand.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.116
Oh, gee, where have I heard that before?

10:10.140 --> 10:10.976
Oh, yeah, Dwayne.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.796
Come on, Tony. Grabbing
credit from a recruit?

10:13.820 --> 10:15.896
I followed up and checked
with the branch manager.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.356
That's what an experienced
special agent does.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.456
Dwayne?

10:20.480 --> 10:22.316
Agent Dwayne Wilson.

10:22.340 --> 10:26.740
The new recruit the director
assigned to us, to you.

10:29.230 --> 10:32.390
You didn't know?

10:34.410 --> 10:37.390
You didn't know.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.136
Gibbs.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.560
I just found out I've
been assigned a rookie.

10:43.590 --> 10:44.930
Only for a few days.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.956
I don't need him.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.236
You need all the help you can get.

10:50.260 --> 10:53.246
A bank robbery in Quantico
is highly embarrassing.

10:53.270 --> 10:57.650
If we can't protect our own house,
how can we protect the nation?

10:57.950 --> 11:00.740
FBI wants to take over.

11:00.780 --> 11:04.310
I asserted that Quantico is first
and foremost a Marine base and,

11:04.340 --> 11:07.036
as such, falls under our jurisdiction.

11:07.060 --> 11:08.980
SECNAV backed me.

11:09.010 --> 11:12.040
That argument is holding for now, but
I'm going to need a quick resolution.

11:12.070 --> 11:15.516
I prefer to choose my own team.

11:15.540 --> 11:19.996
Just like you chose
Special Agent Langer?

11:20.020 --> 11:23.226
That didn't work out very well, did it?

11:23.250 --> 11:26.986
Want to hear me say I made
a mistake about Langer?

11:27.010 --> 11:29.680
Lot of people made a mistake about him.

11:29.710 --> 11:32.036
It's history.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.990
Is it, Leon?

11:35.020 --> 11:38.760
Let me know what you
think about the rookie.

11:48.660 --> 11:53.106
So Major Mass Spec, or Big Daddy,
like he sometimes likes to be called,

11:53.130 --> 11:56.436
analyzes solids,
liquids, vapors, and solutions,

11:56.460 --> 12:01.780
and then an ionizer converts these
substances into a gaseous state.

12:01.810 --> 12:05.230
Then the ions... they're sorted
according to their m/z ratio.

12:05.270 --> 12:07.520
Hey, no touching.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.740
Sorry.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.140
This is from the getaway car.

12:10.170 --> 12:12.946
Are you following all this, Dwayne?

12:12.970 --> 12:15.916
We give you evidence and
you tell us what it is.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.070
Yeah, I guess that's basically it.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.040
Hey, Gibbs. I was just giving
Agent Wilson a tour of Abbyville.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.220
You're Dwayne.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.606
Yes, sir.

12:27.630 --> 12:30.320
You two haven't met?

12:31.360 --> 12:32.350
Awkward.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.106
What have you got, Abs?

12:33.130 --> 12:35.510
Lots of burned out ash from the SUV.

12:35.540 --> 12:39.010
Ah, no touching. What is it with you two?

12:40.110 --> 12:43.006
Sorry. I also found
traces of an accelerant.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.020
Somebody really wanted
this baby to burn.

12:45.050 --> 12:46.046
Destroying evidence.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.780
Not just any evidence, Gibbs.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.650
Wait till you see what Big Daddy found.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.620
Traces of magnetic ink and a blend.

12:53.650 --> 12:54.356
A blend?

12:54.380 --> 12:57.150
25% cotton and 75% linen.

12:57.190 --> 12:59.640
You know what makes
that blend so special?

12:59.680 --> 13:03.590
Only the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing is allowed to use it.

13:03.620 --> 13:04.186
Money.

13:04.210 --> 13:06.916
Technically they call it rag paper.

13:06.940 --> 13:07.890
It's hard to burn.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.480
Exactly, which explains the accelerant.

13:10.510 --> 13:11.626
How much did they barbecue?

13:11.650 --> 13:14.920
Based on the amount of trace
rag paper and magnetic ink,

13:14.950 --> 13:19.290
I would say all $27,000.

13:31.150 --> 13:34.800
This was a sophisticated operation
that took time and money to plan.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.116
And after all that,
they burn the proceeds.

13:38.140 --> 13:41.446
Time, money, futility. Sounds
like one of McGee's date nights.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.806
It was not futility, Tony.
It was by design.

13:43.830 --> 13:45.276
Where have I heard that before?

13:45.300 --> 13:46.930
All right, give me some theories, Ziva.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.060
Maybe they could not get off the base because of
the lockdown, so they destroyed all the evidence.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.190
Uh, they could have stolen
a second car to get out.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.340
McGee.

13:54.370 --> 13:55.836
Maybe they wanted to embarrass the FBI.

13:55.860 --> 13:56.720
Already did that.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.296
We could be looking for a recently
paroled felon with an ax to grind.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.936
DiNozzo.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.266
Yeah. Why'd you call on me last, boss? I
was going to say what they said, honest.

14:04.290 --> 14:07.116
I have a theory, but it's
not flushed out. Never mind.

14:07.140 --> 14:09.510
Agent Wilson.

14:09.540 --> 14:14.210
I don't have a theory, sir, Agent
Gibbs, but if we had access to FBI files,

14:14.250 --> 14:18.840
I'd search other unsolved robberies
that knocked out security cameras.

14:18.870 --> 14:20.886
- Ziva, McGee...
- Follow up on our theories.

14:20.910 --> 14:23.316
- And bank security footage... know it.
- On it.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.856
DiNozzo.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.260
Got it.

14:27.910 --> 14:31.210
Got it, boss.

14:33.220 --> 14:39.520
DiNozzo, since you do not have a theory,
how about you help Agent Wilson with his?

14:39.550 --> 14:42.340
Agent...

14:47.730 --> 14:48.756
Got it.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.986
Where do we start?

14:51.010 --> 14:52.666
FBI.

14:52.690 --> 14:55.370
Let's go, smarty-pants.

15:06.910 --> 15:07.666
Agent Langer.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.936
One of them is betraying their country.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.046
Langer made the jump to NCIS
eight months ago from the FBI.

15:13.070 --> 15:14.256
He got no special treatment.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.990
But you did recommend him.

15:16.020 --> 15:17.560
Am I under investigation?

15:17.590 --> 15:18.186
Should you be?

15:18.210 --> 15:19.630
I'd like a straight yes or no, sir.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.266
- Gibbs.
- Lee?

15:21.290 --> 15:22.436
It's Langer.

15:22.460 --> 15:24.086
Betraying their country.

15:24.110 --> 15:25.090
It's Langer.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.030
You did recommend him.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.050
Sign this, please.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.466
Could you have suggested something
that would require morepaperwork?

15:40.490 --> 15:42.576
I thought the FBI had this
kind of stuff on computer.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.726
- They do.
- Here's your copy.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.110
They want to take the case.

15:46.140 --> 15:50.096
They're trying to paper
us into submission.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.800
Five years of unsolved cases.

15:58.610 --> 16:00.176
Interagency transfer.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.966
Means legal's going to be involved,
which means you've been here one day

16:02.990 --> 16:06.086
and you've already
broken Gibbs' rule #13.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.086
Rule #13?

16:07.110 --> 16:09.876
Yeah, rule #13: Never, ever
involve lawyers.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.416
Things are bound to turn nasty.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.876
I'll rember that.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.656
You should.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.350
Gibbs has be divorced three times.

16:17.380 --> 16:20.600
He has seven rules that involve
lawyers, none of them pretty.

16:20.630 --> 16:22.666
You don't need to
know 'em all, just #13.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.710
It's the umbrella one.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.816
What?

16:28.840 --> 16:30.486
How's Gibbs to work for?

16:30.510 --> 16:32.006
What have you heard?

16:32.030 --> 16:36.136
That bad guys would rather confess
than be interrogated by him?

16:36.160 --> 16:38.626
That his steely gaze can
cool a room by five degrees?

16:38.650 --> 16:41.726
That he can only be killed by a
silver bullet, like a werewolf?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.686
They're all true, except
for the silver bullet part.

16:43.710 --> 16:45.676
Might give him indigestion
or heartburn, but...

16:45.700 --> 16:46.646
I don't think it'd kill him.

16:46.670 --> 16:49.130
Any other questions?

16:49.160 --> 16:51.776
Just one.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.440
What's Gibbs got against me?

16:54.800 --> 16:57.436
You? Nothing.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.676
Don't exactly get a
welcome feeling from him.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.990
Well, he's not exactly
the Mr. Rogers type.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.026
I just got a gut feeling
he doesn't like me.

17:05.050 --> 17:07.136
Oh, you have a gut feeling?

17:07.160 --> 17:10.986
Like he's got something against
me, maybe against all outsiders.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.569
Am I right?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.205
Long story to that one.

17:14.230 --> 17:17.066
What's the short version?

17:17.089 --> 17:20.656
Last outsider he let in
turned out to be a bad apple.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.960
How bad?

17:25.440 --> 17:28.540
That bad.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.606
Here we go.

17:35.630 --> 17:39.186
The start of a very bad
day for Mr. Vittorio.

17:39.210 --> 17:41.630
The start of his last day, you mean.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.226
Kid running with ice cream.

17:43.250 --> 17:44.576
Never ends well.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.826
Mom apologizes.

17:45.850 --> 17:48.406
And Vittorio heads to the bathroom.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.636
That's it. Cameras go down.

17:50.660 --> 17:53.480
Check the security footage
the last three days.

17:53.510 --> 17:54.640
Because?

17:54.670 --> 17:57.206
Because they're pros, and pros plan.

17:57.230 --> 18:00.810
They would have watched
the bank before they hit it.

18:02.490 --> 18:05.570
Come in.

18:07.810 --> 18:11.290
Agent Lee, I need a legal opinion.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.436
Of course.

18:12.460 --> 18:14.276
It's rather sensitive.

18:14.300 --> 18:18.440
How hard is it to terminate agents?

18:19.010 --> 18:20.386
Terminate?

18:20.410 --> 18:23.866
Specifically new agents.

18:23.890 --> 18:26.700
This pile I'm sold on,
this pile not so much.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.836
And you want to terminate
those in the "not so much" pile?

18:29.860 --> 18:32.630
I just want to know my legal options.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.000
All these agents were signed
on under the old administration.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.040
Now, I'm not saying that there
are not some fine people here.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.870
But you'd prefer to be able to choose.

18:41.910 --> 18:44.226
Like I said, options.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.646
I understand.

18:46.670 --> 18:49.436
Well, new agents are probationary.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.096
I know. Do I need
cause to terminate them?

18:52.120 --> 18:56.636
No. If you can articulate a substantive
reason to terminate, that's all you need.

18:56.660 --> 18:58.620
Even before they go to FLETC?

18:58.650 --> 19:00.640
Absolutely.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.836
That's all I need to know. Thank you.

19:02.860 --> 19:05.800
You're welcome, sir.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.680
Agent Gibbs, I'm so sorry, I...

19:31.720 --> 19:32.230
Okay.

19:32.270 --> 19:35.090
- I can be such a klutz sometimes.
- That's okay.

19:37.190 --> 19:39.776
Now you're all settled back into Legal?

19:39.800 --> 19:42.036
Yeah, kind of.

19:42.060 --> 19:47.316
You know, I was a little shaken up for a
while after what happened with Langer, but...

19:47.340 --> 19:50.180
I'm okay now.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.780
Missing the fieldwork.

19:52.810 --> 19:55.820
You know.

19:57.750 --> 20:01.250
I should get back.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.246
Yeah. Gibbs.

20:22.270 --> 20:25.026
I'm trying to weed out
the good from the bad.

20:25.050 --> 20:28.496
I need you to do a written
evaluation on Agent Wilson.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.226
Why?

20:29.250 --> 20:31.330
He's borderline.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.450
Why stick him with me then?

20:33.480 --> 20:35.970
He had to go somewhere.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.596
I'm going to need that evaluation.

20:37.620 --> 20:40.476
Won't be with me long enough.

20:40.500 --> 20:44.180
Bachelor's degree from an online
school only recently accredited.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.996
GPA mediocre at best.

20:46.020 --> 20:47.890
Doesn't speak a foreign language.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.950
Computer skills barely existent.

20:49.990 --> 20:53.046
Putting your stamp on
this agency, are you, Leon?

20:53.070 --> 20:57.110
Our agents should look more
like McGee than they do DiNozzo.

20:57.410 --> 21:01.510
More like you than like me.

21:10.230 --> 21:11.236
What have we got, Duck?

21:11.260 --> 21:12.256
Not much.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.156
Our old friend here, Ray
Vittorio, was shot at close range.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.616
Under three feet.

21:17.640 --> 21:21.350
I extracted this from what was
left of the back of his head.

21:21.390 --> 21:23.900
Hollow point.

21:25.200 --> 21:30.760
This crew had no qualms about what they might
have to do, and they came armed to do it.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.756
You're dealing with cold-blooded
people, Jethro. Oh, yeah.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.600
And to rob a bank on a
Marine secure facility,

21:36.640 --> 21:40.856
these individuals must be extremely
desperate or supremely arrogant.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.426
Or both.

21:43.450 --> 21:45.266
Dwayne Wilson.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.456
He's a baby agent.

21:46.480 --> 21:51.260
And I am looking at his
personnel report because?

21:51.650 --> 21:53.436
It's your thing.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.386
My thing?

21:54.410 --> 21:57.516
I take it that Agent Wilson is alive?

21:57.540 --> 21:58.276
Oh, yeah.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.706
So, you don't want me to do an
autopsy, which leaves my other thing.

22:01.730 --> 22:04.800
Psychological profile?

22:06.210 --> 22:09.460
Aptitude tests, psychological
reports, academic studies.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.526
Yes, I can work up something.

22:11.550 --> 22:17.400
Uh, may I ask why you need it?

22:20.570 --> 22:23.576
What kind of man is he, Duck?

22:23.600 --> 22:30.610
Oh, surely you, of all people,
don't need me to tell you that.

22:31.030 --> 22:33.810
I appreciate it.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.286
No. You went back too far.

22:38.310 --> 22:39.346
I got it.

22:39.370 --> 22:40.996
No, you went back too far.

22:41.020 --> 22:43.340
That's why I'm going fast forward now.

22:43.380 --> 22:45.696
All right, just let me do
it. Let me do it, please, okay?

22:45.720 --> 22:47.796
You handle this like
you handle your car.

22:47.820 --> 22:53.050
And if you want to handle anything ever
again, remove your hand from my mouse.

22:54.250 --> 22:55.216
Boss, got something.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.950
- On the bank security cameras.
- Put it up.

22:58.530 --> 23:01.876
I am almost... there.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.346
There it is. You passed it.

23:05.370 --> 23:08.180
These controls are too sensitive.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.626
- Boss.
- Ziva.

23:11.650 --> 23:13.450
Fine.

23:14.470 --> 23:15.936
All right.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.430
Three days prior to the bank robbery.

23:18.460 --> 23:21.000
Here it comes.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.436
Watch outside the bank.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.356
It's a '99 white Suburban.

23:25.380 --> 23:30.230
Then, four minutes, 23 seconds later.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.786
Same Suburban.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.076
Definitely casing the bank.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.906
Question is, why did they wait
another three days before they hit it?

23:36.930 --> 23:39.566
And the other question is, why
did they burn the money afterwards?

23:39.590 --> 23:42.050
Stop it right there.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.516
That's a different bank guard.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.386
That's why they burned the money.

23:48.410 --> 23:51.366
Because they were not after the money.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.786
No, they were after Vittorio.

23:53.810 --> 23:56.350
This was a hit.

24:03.390 --> 24:07.986
The bank manager says Ray Vittorio was out
sick three days prior to the bank robbery.

24:08.010 --> 24:09.356
Confirms your theory, boss.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.326
I do not understand.

24:10.350 --> 24:11.706
If you want someone dead,
you knock on their door.

24:11.730 --> 24:14.150
They answer, you shoot them. Easy.

24:14.450 --> 24:16.026
For some.

24:16.050 --> 24:18.806
Ziva's right, though. Why rob
a bank just to kill someone?

24:18.830 --> 24:20.590
Collateral damage.

24:20.620 --> 24:24.576
So, they wanted Vittorio's death
to look like collateral damage.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.806
Murder investigation's
different than a bank robbery.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.906
And we've been
investigating a bank robbery.

24:28.930 --> 24:30.736
Not anymore. Ziva.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.940
I will do a full background
check on Ray Vittorio.

24:32.970 --> 24:33.486
McGee.

24:33.510 --> 24:37.310
And I'm just checking to see
if he has a criminal record.

24:37.870 --> 24:39.376
Oh, look at that. Bingo.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.776
1978 felony conviction for
handling stolen property.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.116
And he was allowed to carry a gun?

24:45.140 --> 24:46.356
Non-violent offender.

24:46.380 --> 24:50.266
Granted a restoration of rights certificate
'cause he served only two years.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.760
30 years ago. Been clean ever since.

24:53.590 --> 24:56.580
Or he hasn't been caught.

24:58.070 --> 25:01.660
So why an NCIS agent?

25:02.220 --> 25:05.480
To protect and serve my country.

25:06.420 --> 25:07.956
Come on.

25:07.980 --> 25:13.246
Dwayne, I'm trained in the art of
extracting the truth. You can't snow me.

25:13.270 --> 25:14.176
I can't?

25:14.200 --> 25:16.466
No. You can't.

25:16.490 --> 25:17.896
- For the travel?
- No.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.016
- The babes?
- No.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.376
- Carry a gun?
- No.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.296
Retirement plan?

25:22.320 --> 25:23.810
- No.
- No.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.060
To make a difference?

25:29.100 --> 25:32.930
That was a placebo question.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.096
Whatever you say.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.556
Are you serious?

25:38.580 --> 25:43.180
I mean, make a profound
difference in a man's life, like...

25:43.210 --> 25:45.460
Like what?

25:46.850 --> 25:49.616
My dad was an enlisted
Marine in Vietnam.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.386
Accused of murdering an officer.

25:52.410 --> 25:56.110
Said everyone made him for the
murder, except one NIS agent.

25:56.140 --> 26:01.176
That agent kept investigating, even
after his boss told him to stop.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.836
Ended up exonerating my dad.

26:03.860 --> 26:09.436
If not for that agent, Dad never would've
married Mom, never would've had me.

26:09.460 --> 26:11.026
Dad never forgot.

26:11.050 --> 26:14.530
Told us to always include
him in our prayers.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.576
I wanted to be NCIS...

26:17.600 --> 26:20.606
to make that kind of a difference.

26:20.630 --> 26:23.750
Okay, I buy that.

26:24.890 --> 26:26.716
Why did you become an NCIS agent?

26:26.740 --> 26:28.840
For the guns and the babes.

26:28.870 --> 26:30.126
You're kidding, right?

26:30.150 --> 26:32.546
I got something.

26:32.570 --> 26:36.490
Klaasson's Diamond Boutique
in Maryland six months ago.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.446
It's a regular day, right?

26:38.470 --> 26:42.200
And then... Wait for it.

26:42.940 --> 26:46.950
There. 97 seconds later.

26:48.350 --> 26:50.776
Four million dollars in
diamonds out the door.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.506
None of which have turned
up since the robbery.

26:52.530 --> 26:55.126
Witnesses claimed they
saw two men in ski masks.

26:55.150 --> 26:56.016
Getaway driver.

26:56.040 --> 26:56.816
Makes three.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.246
These are our guys.

26:58.270 --> 26:59.126
They're good.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.026
And they know it.

27:00.050 --> 27:00.986
That's their weakness.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.570
Are we back to robbery as a motive?

27:03.600 --> 27:05.526
That's the robbery.

27:05.550 --> 27:07.846
Vittorio's the murder.

27:07.870 --> 27:10.646
Money, commonalities,
employees, relatives.

27:10.670 --> 27:14.010
You chase everything. Now!

27:16.730 --> 27:17.406
Yeah, Duck.

27:17.430 --> 27:20.710
- I have the Wilson assessment.
- On my way.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.526
Robbery-Homicide, please. I'll hold.

27:25.550 --> 27:26.686
Can I help?

27:26.710 --> 27:27.890
Certainly can.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.046
Long night.

27:29.070 --> 27:31.420
Coffee.

27:37.750 --> 27:38.846
Finished.

27:38.870 --> 27:44.330
You know, Jethro, the more time I spend with
someone, the more accurate I can make my evaluation.

27:44.370 --> 27:49.490
Working from other people's assessments
and reports is far from satisfactory.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.606
But I'll give it a shot.

27:52.630 --> 27:56.676
This agent is more
street-smart than book-smart.

27:56.700 --> 27:59.866
He possesses great inner strength.

27:59.890 --> 28:01.710
He's very focused.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.340
He has a strong sense of
justice that drives him.

28:05.370 --> 28:10.240
He is unrelenting to
the point of obsession.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.700
We're not talking
about a good agent here.

28:12.730 --> 28:16.786
We're talking about an
exceptional investigator.

28:16.810 --> 28:20.966
But such dedication comes at a cost.

28:20.990 --> 28:21.586
Married?

28:21.610 --> 28:25.790
Married four times, divorced three.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.206
That's a nice try, Duck.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.776
I'm not finished, Jethro.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.980
We're talking about a man
who acts on his gut instinct.

28:37.010 --> 28:41.850
Who relies on his ability to judge
people, and he's rarely wrong.

28:41.880 --> 28:48.320
As a result, he's a man who
never suffers from self-doubt.

28:48.700 --> 28:51.940
Until now?

28:52.200 --> 28:54.620
You don't have all the answers.

28:54.700 --> 28:58.750
You recommended that Agent
Langer be brought into the agency.

28:58.800 --> 29:05.550
Now, as a result of his actions, you're having
difficulty trusting your judgment about this young man.

29:06.090 --> 29:11.830
You're simply feeling vulnerable, Jethro.

29:14.880 --> 29:18.200
Appreciate the assessment.

29:21.650 --> 29:22.436
What's that?

29:22.460 --> 29:25.720
It is a test program to check the
bank's wireless Internet connection.

29:25.750 --> 29:26.560
Why?

29:26.590 --> 29:29.520
Because I have already
checked the security system.

29:29.550 --> 29:30.840
Process of elimination.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.406
That. And it's always nice to
look busy when the boss walks in.

29:33.430 --> 29:34.906
Hit pay dirt, boss.

29:34.930 --> 29:38.230
The security company that was
protecting Klaasson's Diamond Boutique

29:38.290 --> 29:40.950
is the same security company
the bank uses in Quantico.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.130
Which is owned by Paul Harris.

29:43.160 --> 29:46.880
His company is maxed-out on its credit line,
and is two months in arrears on its rent.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.156
Had a bad feeling about that guy.

29:48.180 --> 29:49.086
His teeth sparkled.

29:49.110 --> 29:49.706
Meaning?

29:49.730 --> 29:53.400
Meaning no one has teeth that white
unless they have something to hide.

29:53.430 --> 29:54.926
Maybe the bank cameras were not jammed.

29:54.950 --> 29:57.216
Maybe they were switched
off from Harris' office.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.286
Wasn't the cameras. It was
the Internet connection.

29:59.310 --> 30:00.566
Take a look, boss.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.316
I was checking the bank's broadband.

30:02.340 --> 30:07.646
For the 93 seconds those cameras went down, bank's network
was overloaded with three million simultaneous hits,

30:07.670 --> 30:09.336
all from a single source.

30:09.360 --> 30:12.586
It slowed down the system so much, it
couldn't transmit the security footage.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.806
There are system protocols that
should've prevented this kind of thing.

30:14.830 --> 30:18.190
Who better to beat the system
than the guy who installed it?

30:18.220 --> 30:22.060
I know a little about suits, and
that one's pretty expensive, huh?

30:22.090 --> 30:25.590
You brought me here to
compliment me on my suit?

30:25.620 --> 30:27.466
How do you get those teeth so white?

30:27.490 --> 30:29.530
You, uh, cap 'em?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.850
You like to use those whitening strips?

30:31.880 --> 30:34.300
How about the mouth guard
with the gunky gel in it?

30:34.330 --> 30:36.980
You use one of those? How do you do it?

30:37.370 --> 30:38.866
Tony has his own style.

30:38.890 --> 30:42.770
Sort of Dirty Harry meets Keystone Cop.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.646
You got a serious question
for me, Agent DiNozzo?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.890
Yeah.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.470
How's business, Paul?

30:51.500 --> 30:53.760
It's fine.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.116
That was a big one.

31:01.140 --> 31:03.180
Lies make my ears itch.

31:03.210 --> 31:04.346
You should know that.

31:04.370 --> 31:06.770
So let me ask again.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.840
How's business, Paul?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.840
I've been going through
a rough patch, actually.

31:13.870 --> 31:16.486
Yeah, that sounds like the truth.

31:16.510 --> 31:22.186
And yet, you've got the expensive
clothes and the nice bright white teeth,

31:22.210 --> 31:26.696
expensive boat, super-expensive house.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.616
How do you reconcile all those things?

31:28.640 --> 31:30.866
Maybe by robbing a bank
and a diamond dealer?

31:30.890 --> 31:31.946
I'm sorry. What?

31:31.970 --> 31:37.580
Klaasson's Diamond Boutique... same
MO, same security company: Yours.

31:37.610 --> 31:41.900
Klaasson's was, um... some time ago.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.520
Did you run out of money, Paul?

31:47.320 --> 31:48.826
I wasn't involved with that.

31:48.850 --> 31:51.680
Your security cameras, Paul.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.400
I don't know... how they did it. Okay?

31:57.030 --> 31:58.376
Unbearable.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.820
You're gonna push me a
little bit, aren't you?

32:03.610 --> 32:05.586
We have a McGnome in our
office. He never gets out.

32:05.610 --> 32:07.316
He smells like an
overheated computer chip.

32:07.340 --> 32:10.986
But, boy, man alive, does he
know computers, inside and out.

32:11.010 --> 32:14.426
And he explained to me that
there was this network, right,

32:14.450 --> 32:21.240
and it got bombarded with all these hits, and
it slowed it way down, and disabled the camera.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.306
It's kind of crazy.

32:22.330 --> 32:28.630
And he also said, protocol should have prevented
it, protocols that you could've gotten around.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.696
Okay. It was a flaw in
the system. All right?

32:34.720 --> 32:37.350
A flaw?

32:37.380 --> 32:40.356
I learned about it after
the diamond robbery.

32:40.380 --> 32:41.276
That's convenient.

32:41.300 --> 32:45.166
Look, I'll show you my records.
I-I've been... fixing it on site.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.520
And I didn't get around
to Quantico because...

32:47.920 --> 32:49.720
come on, who robs Quantico?

32:49.750 --> 32:52.256
Without a cash influx, you're gonna
be out of business in two months.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.856
I told you, I'll show you my records.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.120
You'll see, I've been
fixing the problem.

32:57.150 --> 33:01.510
I'm gonna track down every move
you've made in the last six months,

33:01.550 --> 33:04.826
and I'm gonna have a little
chat with every person you know.

33:04.850 --> 33:07.280
Don't do that, okay?

33:07.920 --> 33:09.696
Why?

33:09.720 --> 33:12.760
'Cause you'll ruin it.

33:14.010 --> 33:15.026
"It"?

33:15.050 --> 33:17.236
My wedding plans.

33:17.260 --> 33:20.376
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

33:20.400 --> 33:24.670
They say a picture's
worth a thousand words.

33:27.820 --> 33:30.396
Her name's Stella Rawlings.

33:30.420 --> 33:31.156
And?

33:31.180 --> 33:37.280
And she's heir to one of the largest
wine distributorships on the East Coast.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.536
See, I don't need to rob a bank.

33:41.560 --> 33:45.070
I'm about to marry one.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.726
Oh, that is gonna leave a mark.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.560
Look at that.

34:02.430 --> 34:04.656
I scratched myself in
the line of duty, boss.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.976
I'll live.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.815
Ray Vittorio was a widower
with a 28-year-old son.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.326
And?

34:10.350 --> 34:13.295
And that son has a record, too:
Handling stolen property.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.676
Daddy passed the baton.

34:14.699 --> 34:18.956
Except his son has dealt in
higher-end items: Paintings, artifacts.

34:18.980 --> 34:19.600
Where is he?

34:19.630 --> 34:21.005
Last known address was in Maryland.

34:21.030 --> 34:24.016
But his former landlord said
he disappeared six months ago.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.620
I cannot track him anywhere.

34:25.659 --> 34:27.290
The diamond robbery was six months ago.

34:27.340 --> 34:30.360
It's not a coincidence. Keep looking.

34:35.179 --> 34:38.489
Wait. Go back.

34:39.929 --> 34:43.146
Stop.

34:43.170 --> 34:45.545
This guy, right here,
with his back to us.

34:45.570 --> 34:49.060
Zoom in on his right arm.

34:50.780 --> 34:54.525
More.

34:54.550 --> 34:58.540
Where have I seen that tattoo before?

35:01.580 --> 35:02.676
What are you doing?

35:02.700 --> 35:06.000
Shh! I'm arranging my thoughts.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.276
- Pull up the bank robbery footage.
- Why?

35:14.300 --> 35:16.740
Just do it... McGee.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.220
Move.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.016
I saw this earlier.

35:25.040 --> 35:29.276
I wondered why someone would be covering up
such a nice piece of artwork on a warm day.

35:29.300 --> 35:32.510
Very strange.Watch.

35:39.440 --> 35:43.186
When we interviewed him outside the bank,
tattoo man said his name was Curtis Ranier;

35:43.210 --> 35:44.596
Had a driver's license to prove it.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.456
Which was fake.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.910
His real name is James Meyers.

35:46.950 --> 35:49.216
He's an ex con; Did time
for electronic theft.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.630
That's four bank robbers.

35:50.660 --> 35:54.676
Two men in ski masks, one
getaway driver, and... him.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.500
- Known associates, McGee. Find them.
- On it.

35:57.620 --> 35:58.656
There's more.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.080
Guess who his cellmate was.

36:01.850 --> 36:05.016
Joey Vittorio, the dead guard's son.

36:05.040 --> 36:10.590
Before the diamond heist, Vittorio served four years
in the Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown.

36:10.630 --> 36:12.026
Meyers served seven.

36:12.050 --> 36:13.116
- Doc.
- Yes, sir.

36:13.140 --> 36:14.896
Has Ray Vittorio's body been collected?

36:14.920 --> 36:17.626
Joey Vittorio is missing.

36:17.650 --> 36:21.096
Meyers and his crew killed his
dad as part of the bank robbery.

36:21.120 --> 36:21.826
Why?

36:21.850 --> 36:23.036
Collateral damage.

36:23.060 --> 36:25.136
Zeva, find out when he's being buried.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.286
Because money wasn't the object.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.470
They wanted to lure Joey out of hiding.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.526
He must've been their fence.

36:30.550 --> 36:32.776
He kept the diamonds for himself, which
is why they never turned up.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.176
He must've gone underground with them.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.616
But he'll go to his dad's funeral...

36:35.640 --> 36:38.266
If he thinks it has something
to do with the stolen diamonds.

36:38.290 --> 36:40.760
Known associates, boss.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.340
They've all done time.

36:44.370 --> 36:47.640
- Gibbs, the funeral is happening now.
- Let's go.

36:52.030 --> 36:53.970
Reception at the Parrish Hall.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.790
Thank you for your attendance.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.196
Ray Vittorio was a popular man.

37:05.220 --> 37:06.456
Italian, what do you expect?

37:06.480 --> 37:08.346
The service is ending.

37:08.370 --> 37:09.676
Let's move.

37:09.700 --> 37:10.840
Stay.

37:10.890 --> 37:11.496
I'm an agent.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.926
Without a weapon. Guard the car.

37:13.950 --> 37:17.820
Spread out. Look for
Meyers and his crew.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.396
Anybody, anything?

37:29.420 --> 37:30.746
That's a negative, boss.

37:30.770 --> 37:33.810
- Negative.
- No.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.376
Maybe they're not here.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.430
They're here.

37:43.670 --> 37:46.746
Let go! We can talk.
We can work this out!

37:46.770 --> 37:49.886
On the road, black
SUV, eastern side. Move it.

37:49.910 --> 37:53.936
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Get in the car, Joey.

37:53.960 --> 37:57.480
Come on... Get off me.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.336
Get us out of here.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.926
He's got us blocked in.

38:02.950 --> 38:05.046
Hey, Nana. Time to go.

38:05.070 --> 38:07.406
Hey, buddy, move your car.

38:07.430 --> 38:10.396
Sure, no problem. Just have
to get my grandma here.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.606
Nana, are you ready to go?

38:12.630 --> 38:15.820
- Go?
- Come on.

38:20.650 --> 38:24.400
- Cops!
- Get down.

38:25.050 --> 38:27.530
Federal agents!

38:32.410 --> 38:35.570
NCIS! Drop your weapons!

38:39.110 --> 38:43.426
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

38:43.450 --> 38:45.406
Get out of the car! Put
your hands on the ground.

38:45.430 --> 38:48.356
All right. We're coming out!

38:48.380 --> 38:50.906
- On the ground!
- Please, don't shoot.

38:50.930 --> 38:53.660
- Get down on the ground.
- Now!

38:58.500 --> 39:02.010
You're not my grandson.

39:14.770 --> 39:17.246
For a job well done.

39:17.270 --> 39:19.216
It might mean more if you paid for it.

39:19.240 --> 39:22.076
We're government employees.
Get used to disappointment.

39:22.100 --> 39:23.450
Good luck at FLETC.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.026
Yes, and a word of advice.

39:25.050 --> 39:27.120
The ATF girls are smokin' hot.

39:27.150 --> 39:30.006
They're a little crazy, but
they're really hot.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.570
I'm married, Tony.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.430
Then only talk to the
Bureau of Prisons girls.

39:35.470 --> 39:38.160
That'll keep you celibate, unless
you're like McGee.

39:38.190 --> 39:40.566
Just don't mouth off
to the instructors...

39:40.590 --> 39:42.586
Or the Bureau of Prisons Girls.

39:42.610 --> 39:45.700
And you'll be fine.

40:40.070 --> 40:43.680
Your assessment of Agent Wilson?

40:45.590 --> 40:49.306
You didn't write anything.

40:49.330 --> 40:53.110
"Recommended." Write that.

40:59.490 --> 41:00.706
- Wilson.
- Sir?

41:00.730 --> 41:02.850
Good luck.

41:18.550 --> 41:21.540
Bourbon, neat.

41:28.860 --> 41:31.536
On your own tonight?

41:31.560 --> 41:33.880
No.
