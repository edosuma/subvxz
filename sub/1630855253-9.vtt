WEBVTT

00:20.020 --> 00:21.521
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:24.232 --> 00:25.191
Marko,

00:25.275 --> 00:27.527
I'll never forget what the major did.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.488
Those horrible experiments.
The connection you had with my son.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.490
<i>When I found my way here,</i>

00:32.574 --> 00:36.119
everybody was telling me
it was five years later.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.873
I thought I was going crazy.
Somebody called the cops.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.083
It's okay. You're safe now.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.710
NYPD.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.756
Hey! Vasquez from 129! Tone it down, man.

00:47.839 --> 00:51.259
-He's not hurting anyone.
-Who cares? He's a passenger.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.182
You know what you need? A tarot reading.

00:57.265 --> 01:01.019
You, sir, have a very lucky future.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.063
I am lucky.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.532
Hang in there, bud.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.534
We got this.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.538
I just want better numbers this time.

01:35.887 --> 01:39.766
We've had you on
Saanvi's immunotherapy treatment

01:39.849 --> 01:41.101
for the past month.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.732
Your body isn't responding.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.068
And the cancer has progressed.

01:50.860 --> 01:51.820
Rapidly.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.697
What happens now?

01:55.198 --> 01:57.283
Go home. Rest.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.786
Be with your family.

01:59.869 --> 02:00.870
No, uh…

02:02.747 --> 02:04.666
We're gonna get his numbers back up,
his energy.

02:05.416 --> 02:09.087
-How soon can he start another course?
-I'm afraid we're past that.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.966
We can never be certain about timelines,

02:13.049 --> 02:19.013
but… you're likely looking at days
rather than weeks.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.683
There's gotta be something you can do.
You saved him last time.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.310
Alex has done everything
that I would've done.

02:27.063 --> 02:27.897
I'm sorry.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
No.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.442
We're not gonna give up, all right?

02:31.526 --> 02:36.156
Every day we can buy is another day
we can figure out how to beat this.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.117
Sometimes, as much as we want to,

02:39.742 --> 02:41.369
we can't buy more time.

02:41.452 --> 02:45.123
We are gonna keep Cal comfortable.
Get him on hospice.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.207
Morphine.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.460
Um, we will get him
a hospital bed for home.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.591
You should let the family know

02:56.092 --> 02:58.011
'cause you guys are gonna need each other.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.765
Can we keep this just between us?

03:04.142 --> 03:06.811
Tonight should be
just about Mick and Zeke,

03:08.396 --> 03:10.982
and I don't want everyone thinking
I'm gonna die.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.028
We don't have to tell them,
because you are not gonna die.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.574
-Okay?
-Okay.

03:31.002 --> 03:31.961
Ugh.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.379
This is excruciating.

03:37.675 --> 03:38.509
Mm.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.347
-Your chopping's improving.
-You're saying that 'cause I'm crying.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.433
I know a good cure for onion tears.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.271
Hmm-mm.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.232
One more, please.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.454
-Hey. Is everything okay?
-Hey.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.791
Sorry, I just keep playing it
over and over in my head.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.125
I don't know what to do.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.670
About the Registry job?

04:14.504 --> 04:15.588
Drea's made it work there,

04:15.672 --> 04:18.299
you know, but I'm not
a political animal like she is.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.384
I don't know.

04:20.176 --> 04:24.138
I just don't feel like I can keep fronting
as an 828 hater all over again.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.598
You need to be a detective again.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.601
I do. But like this?

04:28.685 --> 04:31.980
Look, you've sacrificed so much.
We know where you stand.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.731
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.732
How's the leg?

04:34.816 --> 04:38.903
One day at a time, but I didn't wanna
put off celebrating anymore.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.745
Oh shit. Sorry, guys. My bad.
I should've called first.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.082
You guys are celebrating, what?
Three years?

04:51.666 --> 04:52.792
Happy anniversary.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.921
We have plenty of food.
Why don't you stay?

04:58.840 --> 04:59.757
Come on.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.094
Thanks, man.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.225
Hey. Sweep over there.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.653
Kenroy, you got a light?

05:23.114 --> 05:24.240
Kenroy!

05:24.324 --> 05:26.617
Old-timer wants an after-dinner smoke.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.120
No smoking. You know the rules.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.000
Most people respond to their name
ten out of ten times,

05:34.083 --> 05:36.586
but you're
more of an eight-out-of-ten guy.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.504
So what gives?

05:39.297 --> 05:40.631
My hearing's not so great.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.343
Right. What are you running from?

05:45.511 --> 05:46.763
Just here to help like you.

05:48.473 --> 05:52.435
Tell the man he can smoke outside
at least 50 feet from the door.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.063
You tell him, Kenroy.

05:55.646 --> 05:56.773
I'm taking a break.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.099
Yeah.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.351
You sure this is okay?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
It's fine. It's a celebration.

07:18.020 --> 07:18.855
Okay.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.189
-Here we go.
-There we go.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.190
-All right.
-Here.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.358
Thank you.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.194
Thank you.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.156
-I'll take some of that.
-You probably shouldn't, bud.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.826
Aha! Bad cop. That's another reason
I don't wanna be a parent.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.494
-Come on, Dad.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.620
Ooh.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.205
One sip won't hurt.

07:36.789 --> 07:37.748
All right.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.628
To my sister.

07:43.796 --> 07:44.630
My rock.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.134
To Zeke, my brother. Mick's rock.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.595
And, uh, sometimes my rock.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.680
I think what we're trying to say
is that you rock.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.393
Together, you've shown us
how to live for today.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.979
And how to love.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.190
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.524
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

08:05.526 --> 08:10.990
Uh, well, as someone who is still
in search of their person,

08:11.073 --> 08:12.408
you two give me hope.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.745
So here's to happiness and to hope.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.788
-Yeah. Cheers.
-Cheers.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.706
Cheers.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.041
One more. One more.

08:20.124 --> 08:20.958
Um…

08:21.542 --> 08:24.545
Just gonna call it how it is. Uh…

08:25.254 --> 08:27.006
I haven't always
been rooting for this couple.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.216
Is that so?

08:30.801 --> 08:34.096
But the best man won.
So did the best woman.

08:35.806 --> 08:36.849
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.226
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.729
Michaela and I are unbelievably grateful

08:41.812 --> 08:43.940
for this anniversary
we never thought we'd have.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.026
Special shout out to Cal
for bringing us together.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.945
-Hear, hear.
-Yeah.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.322
-To Cal.
-To Cal.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.956
Uh…

09:42.039 --> 09:44.500
Okay. What did… what did we miss?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.210
Olive, you didn't see anything?

09:46.294 --> 09:50.256
No. Why… why would I see something
in your Calling?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.384
-Because you were in it.
-Wait. Olive was in your Calling?

09:53.467 --> 09:56.554
-You guys all were.
-I certainly didn't have a Calling.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.140
-What does this mean?
-I don't know. I don't-- I just--

09:59.223 --> 10:00.891
It felt foreboding.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.602
I think we're running out of time.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.270
We are.

10:05.563 --> 10:09.108
Okay. It was hard for me
to make out who was there at first.

10:12.153 --> 10:15.281
I think seeing you guys
in our seats, that was…

10:15.364 --> 10:16.240
Terrifying.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.410
The plane then took a nosedive.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.540
I think I saw a call light turn on.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.961
A passenger needs our help.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.797
Maybe more than one. You see
the person at the back of the plane?

10:31.881 --> 10:33.633
<i>It was Thomas.</i>
<i>Remember the stowaway?</i>

10:37.011 --> 10:39.764
<i>He was pulling at the cargo hatch</i>
<i>like his life depended on it.</i>

10:44.477 --> 10:46.395
More champagne, anyone?

10:48.022 --> 10:50.775
-Passenger boards.
-Yeah.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.402
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.489
I guess I'm a lightweight.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.285
Go. Go. We'll figure out this call button
from down here.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.121
That's the Thomas you saw?

11:04.205 --> 11:06.832
We should talk to him. Figure out
what he was doing in the Calling.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.669
Yeah, might be hard.
Bethany lost contact with him a year ago.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.879
I mean, he'd been through so much.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.215
He escaped death threats in Jamaica.

11:14.298 --> 11:17.343
Gets to New York five years later,
and then his boyfriend Leo's missing.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.554
Yeah, and with Thomas disappeared, he's
probably living off the grid somewhere.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.723
How do you find an invisible man?

11:24.433 --> 11:25.267
Uh, Mick?

11:28.020 --> 11:31.899
So, I still don't get Callings.
So a little help?

11:31.982 --> 11:34.777
The needle was spinning.
Now it isn't pointing north.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.779
I think it's leading us to somewhere.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.990
-Or someone.
-Or to an invisible stowaway.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.335
Oh, hold up. Hold up. I got it.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.921
It's all right. Leave it. Leave it.
I got it.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.720
Here.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.679
Come on.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.180
No, no, no.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.765
You don't need to suffer, Cal.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.143
I do need to be able to think
so we can solve this Calling.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.270
Dad, I wanna help with the Lifeboat.

12:09.353 --> 12:13.107
-Your pain meds will help you feel better.
-What if the Calling can help me?

12:13.190 --> 12:16.819
What if I can help myself?
Dad, this is my choice.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.155
Okay.

12:20.990 --> 12:26.120
All right, boss. Let's find out
whose call button you saw.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.999
It was right by where
the big bag fell out of the overhead.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.294
All right, that's row seven.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.171
Why didn't I see that?

12:35.254 --> 12:38.507
The light came on
right at the end of the Calling.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.926
It was the opposite side of the plane.
Window seat.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.970
That's 7F.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.309
-That's Marko Valeriev's seat.
-We gotta go see Marko.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.060
Come on.
There's no way I'm gonna expose you

12:50.144 --> 12:51.937
to that bacteria at that care facility.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.566
Well, if I can help the Lifeboat
help us survive, then I have to.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.151
Come on, Cal. Please calm down.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.154
-Well, if I'm not gonna go, you need to.
-No, I'm not gonna leave your side.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.238
I'll go.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.824
-Zeke. Are you sure?
-I'm fine.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.075
Okay, we'll both go.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.620
All right. Thank you. Let us know
when you find him, and call--

13:07.703 --> 13:09.205
No. Can you get Marko here?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.456
That's not a good idea.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.833
Well, I need to talk to Marko. I know it.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.252
They don't let strangers
take patients out on field trips.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.796
We'll give it a shot.

13:16.879 --> 13:17.755
Yeah.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.133
All right.

14:10.766 --> 14:14.937
Yeah, I have no idea why a muggle like me
would show up in a Calling.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.981
Me neither.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.610
So, any progress
on the ever-elusive Omega Sapphire?

14:22.611 --> 14:24.405
I may have found a reference to it

14:24.488 --> 14:28.659
in a translation of a 19th-century
trader's diary from Yerevan.

14:28.742 --> 14:29.577
What'd it say?

14:29.660 --> 14:33.622
Uh, he met a man
from a secret order called Omega,

14:33.706 --> 14:38.586
and their sole purpose was
to protect a mystical sapphire.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.087
Okay, now that's something.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.382
Except then the trail goes cold.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.676
We'll get there.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.303
When?

14:49.013 --> 14:52.808
When? Because we've been at this
for weeks.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.977
This stuff takes time, Ol. You know that.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.148
What is it?

14:59.857 --> 15:06.405
Legend says the Divine Sapphire
gave the Oracle of Delphi untold powers.

15:08.198 --> 15:12.411
So just imagine… just imagine
what we could do with this.

15:13.662 --> 15:14.830
Like helping Cal.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.082
Maybe.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.754
Because I don't know how much time

15:23.255 --> 15:24.173
Cal has left.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.220
Hope this rickety old thing
knows where it's going.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.432
I feel really bad pulling you away
from your anniversary.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.684
No, look, we found Thomas
together last time--

15:35.768 --> 15:37.019
Wait. Wait. Wait.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.689
I think the compass is telling us
to go inside this building.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.193
-We've been here before.
-Oh my God.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.779
It's the boiler room where we hid Thomas.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.280
Maybe he's back.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.715
What are you doing down here?
This area is off-limits.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.801
Whoa! Stalk much?

16:09.718 --> 16:12.346
I'm trying to figure out
what's hidden in this creepy maze.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.639
You too, Kenster?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.517
I'm only down here
to stop you from trespassing.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.644
And stealing! You cannot do that.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.104
Come on.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.731
We both know whoever built this place
was flush with cash

16:22.815 --> 16:26.610
built off the backs of people like us.
They won't miss an old tile.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.488
Put it back, or I'll call the police.

16:29.571 --> 16:33.617
What if I told you
they stashed a rock down here so powerful

16:33.701 --> 16:35.119
it can make dreams come true?

16:36.370 --> 16:37.413
That's BS.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.873
You're a church-going guy, right?

16:39.957 --> 16:42.793
Well, I know about miracles.
I was on Flight 828.

16:44.962 --> 16:45.796
You were?

16:45.879 --> 16:50.300
Now, I get messages
from, um, what you might call God.

16:50.384 --> 16:54.263
And she's been guiding me,
crankily at times,

16:54.346 --> 16:56.765
telling me I have to go through this door.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.768
You could call the cops.

17:00.936 --> 17:01.895
Or…

17:03.897 --> 17:05.524
see what's on the other side.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.961
-Okay, this is a little underwhelming.
-Uh…

17:26.045 --> 17:29.381
I don't get it. Why would the compass
lead us to an empty room?

17:31.341 --> 17:32.801
Saanvi, get back!

17:39.933 --> 17:42.936
Well, if it isn't Watson and Holmes.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.615
-So, um, who's that guy?
-A friend.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.952
'Cause you have friends?
What are you doing here, Eagan?

17:59.036 --> 18:02.289
What do you think? The same as you.
Following a Calling, right?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.627
What was your Calling?

18:06.710 --> 18:09.254
So I see we're playing
"I'll show you mine if you show me yours."

18:09.338 --> 18:11.298
Yeah, a little bit. You wanna go first?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.258
Who wrote this?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.470
Uh…

18:16.553 --> 18:18.388
A passenger. His name's Thomas.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.851
When he landed,
he was searching for the love of his life.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.978
He was supposed to meet him at a fountain.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.688
At the Angel of the Waters,

18:28.190 --> 18:29.691
but he wasn't there.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.111
You're Leo.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.197
Knew it! So not a Kenroy.

18:35.864 --> 18:36.949
What hap--

18:37.574 --> 18:38.575
Where were you?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.537
When the plane disappeared,

18:43.413 --> 18:45.874
I thought God wanted to separate us

18:47.000 --> 18:48.627
to punish us for our love.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.797
I hope you see that that's not true.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.008
-I dream of him every night.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.760
Not to bust up this Hallmark moment,

18:56.844 --> 18:59.012
but your compass
is not acting very compass-y.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.352
It's pointed right at the heart.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.021
Wait, Eagan! No!

19:08.105 --> 19:10.315
-Stop!
-What are you doing? Stop, stop, stop!

19:14.820 --> 19:18.115
Don't you see? That compass
is pointing the way to the sapphire.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.241
Seriously?

19:19.324 --> 19:21.118
Logan and I were cellies in prison.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.536
Logan Strickland the 828er?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.496
No, Logan Strickland
the Pilates instructor.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.375
Yes, the 828er.
He told me all about the compass.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.211
He said it was a family heirloom,
but didn't paint the big picture.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.255
Well, I got the extended dance version.

19:33.922 --> 19:37.801
Great-Grandpa Arnold, the first famed
compass owner, was also a Freemason.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.012
And one building he worked on
was the lodge next door,

19:40.095 --> 19:42.973
AKA the Masonic Temple of the Omega Order.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.060
This boiler room must've been
part of it at some point.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.687
That image looks familiar.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.023
He drew a heart in front of the other.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.942
Like Thomas was pointing us right to it.

19:54.026 --> 19:58.864
A puzzle carved into stone
by Logan's great-grandfather.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.158
There's more.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.660
You really think this is gonna lead us
to the Omega Sapphire?

20:03.744 --> 20:06.038
Oh, I know it does.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.165
Some muscle, please?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.586
That thing over there. Move this thing.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.716
I can't allow unauthorized access
to an 828 patient.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.760
The Registry is very strict on that.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.386
Well, listen, this is an emergency.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.305
Well, then why hasn't anyone notified me?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.769
Okay, consider this a notification.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.231
Marko Valeriev is a person of interest
in a developing case.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.442
No, that makes no sense.
The man's been comatose for years.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.572
I assume you're aware that obstructing
a law enforcement officer

20:40.656 --> 20:41.990
is an arrestable offense.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.285
Come on, Vasquez.
Zein's just trying to do their job, right?

20:45.369 --> 20:47.287
Mm. I suggested they do their job better.

20:47.371 --> 20:50.249
Since I've been standing here,
I noted a code violation or two.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.085
Hopefully, nothing that would
endanger patients.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.504
He's a real stickler for the rules.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.632
We'll have him back before daybreak.
What do you say?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.175
I don't know.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.135
Look, if you have a problem,

21:02.219 --> 21:04.012
you go ahead
and call the Registry yourself

21:04.096 --> 21:07.015
'cause either you or Marko are coming
down to the station with me tonight.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.434
That's your choice.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.145
The size of these insets match my tiles.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.730
<i>Stolen </i>tiles.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.898
Borrowed.

21:16.024 --> 21:19.695
These images look familiar.
I think there's more to this puzzle.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.446
-Care to share?

21:21.530 --> 21:23.615
Hey, look what I found.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.869
-Oh my God.
-No way.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.291
Al-Zuras' tarot deck.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.794
The images match the cards perfectly.
Aunt Mick, where are you?

21:35.877 --> 21:39.464
Long story, but I think
that this is all a treasure hunt

21:39.548 --> 21:41.008
to lead us towards the Omega--

21:41.091 --> 21:42.134
Sapphire.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.135
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

21:43.719 --> 21:45.595
Can you send me
a picture of the tarot deck?

21:45.679 --> 21:46.722
I think this is a map.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.765
Yes, sending now. Sending now.

21:48.849 --> 21:49.766
Yeah.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.522
Tarot cards? Please be joking.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.650
Look, the Roman numerals
match the ones on the tarot deck.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.860
That can't be a coincidence.

21:59.943 --> 22:03.822
You know, maybe we need to match
the image with the corresponding number.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.158
-Except Romans don't do zeros, genius.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.328
Hmm, Al-Zuras' tarot deck does.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.829
Card zero. The Fool.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.248
Oh! That one's got your name
written all over it.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.760
I got this one, man.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.471
If you insist.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.607
Okay, what's next?

22:40.734 --> 22:41.693
Cal!

22:43.028 --> 22:45.030
Hold on. I got you.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.823
I got you.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.243
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.746
-What happened?
-I just wanted the remote.

22:53.580 --> 22:58.627
I get the remote, the water, the snacks,
the whatever. You just rest, deal?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.088
Dad, I'm fine.
I just got dizzy for a second.

23:02.672 --> 23:03.924
We have the morphine.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.219
No, I… Marko's not even here yet.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.138
I need to stay alert. He needs me.
The Lifeboat needs me.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.224
This isn't all on you, Cal.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.976
Okay? You're pushing too hard.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.520
Let me help.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.648
How about that water, then?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.611
At your service.

23:33.954 --> 23:37.374
Justice, eighth. Twelfth, the Hanged Man.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.418
Hey, now. This feels personal.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.503
It's all about you, isn't it?

23:53.890 --> 23:55.684
Hey. They're here.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.311
Come on. Let's get you up.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.744
-Thank you, guys.
-A little good cop, bad cop. Team effort.

24:14.828 --> 24:15.662
Yeah.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.581
I haven't seen him since the plane.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.332
He patted my head.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.835
He's calmer here with you
than he did on the ride over.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.712
He's breathing deeper, slower.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.922
Maybe we're still connected somehow.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.050
He looks sad.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.511
-Cal.
-Cal, careful, man.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.346
Marko won't hurt him.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.185
Pretty sure this hasn't happened before.

24:39.227 --> 24:42.189
When he let out a teardrop,
nurse said he couldn't believe it.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.566
It's like he's seeing something.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.529
He needs a pen and paper.
Look at his finger position.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.698
It's like when
I couldn't express my Callings.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.159
Maybe he's trying to draw.

25:17.641 --> 25:18.683
Hey.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.562
He drew these lines and then…

25:22.646 --> 25:23.647
Nothing.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.564
Yeah.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.899
Guys, maybe he's just done.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.317
I don't think so.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.319
Nice daddy helping.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.904
Thank you.

25:36.952 --> 25:37.869
Here.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.007
Marko wants something.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.095
Dad, we need Eden's crayons.

25:56.221 --> 26:00.517
Sometimes when I would get Callings,
the feelings would come to me as colors.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.519
It helped me take the next step.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.154
Try a different color.

26:27.669 --> 26:28.503
It's working.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.318
Is that…

26:53.028 --> 26:53.987
a volcano?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.535
That's not just any volcano.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.340
Done and dusted.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.009
Okay, but Al-Zuras' deck
has one more card.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.302
<i>The World card.</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:22.932
-And they match.
-What does that mean?

27:23.016 --> 27:25.935
I don't know. Maybe that's why
we were all in the same Calling.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.687
Your journeys go hand in hand.

27:32.901 --> 27:36.279
Hey. So we've solved everything
that we can, but we're just missing the--

27:36.363 --> 27:38.198
The World card.
The one with the volcano on it.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.575
-How'd you know?
<i>-Marko drew it.</i>

27:40.659 --> 27:41.951
Wait. Marko can draw?

27:42.035 --> 27:44.621
Yeah, and we were able to find out
what it was, thanks to Cal.

27:45.705 --> 27:48.500
Okay, so we know
that we need the World card to solve this,

27:48.583 --> 27:49.542
<i>but now what?</i>

27:50.043 --> 27:51.836
There's one thing different
on Marko's drawing.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.505
<i>It's a fire.</i>

27:53.588 --> 27:55.423
<i>Does this mean anything to you?</i>

27:56.007 --> 27:58.510
You know what? It might.
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

28:04.307 --> 28:06.017
Okay, so I noticed this grate earlier.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.060
Me too.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.229
Yeah, it's a triangle.

28:11.564 --> 28:13.358
Perhaps indicative of a volcano?

28:13.441 --> 28:14.609
Does anyone have a light?

28:16.027 --> 28:16.861
Bro.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.197
Oh. Me.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.242
Thank you.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.341
Oh my God.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.037
She was on Ben's board.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.123
She's dying.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.210
There's something in there.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.593
That could be the…

29:21.676 --> 29:22.594
Sapphire.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.679
The last Omega Sapphire?

29:28.391 --> 29:30.518
Eagan, wait.
I don't think we should move it.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.530
To think I could've had it years ago.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.033
-How could you have known?
-My first Calling.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.076
I was supposed to find it back then.

29:47.994 --> 29:48.912
I think we were too.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.171
Eagan! Eagan!

30:03.468 --> 30:04.844
-Michaela!
-My leg!

30:07.096 --> 30:08.056
Michaela!

30:09.808 --> 30:12.060
Go! Before the whole place collapses!

30:12.143 --> 30:15.104
-We're supposed to be here with you.
-Not a chance we're leaving you.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.997
All right.
When I say pull, you're gonna pull.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.459
One, two, three. Pull!

30:36.543 --> 30:38.002
Okay, a little more! A little more!

30:38.086 --> 30:39.963
-I got you!

30:44.259 --> 30:46.386
I can stem the bleeding,
but we gotta get him out ASAP.

30:46.469 --> 30:47.762
Eagan locked us in.

30:49.013 --> 30:49.973
What about that?

30:50.056 --> 30:51.057
It's welded shut.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.897
Maybe we can get out through here?

30:59.774 --> 31:02.569
-Wait, wait, wait. Mick! What's that?

31:11.452 --> 31:12.453
It's you.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.454
Thomas!

31:18.626 --> 31:19.711
Leo?

31:20.461 --> 31:22.547
-My love!

31:23.756 --> 31:24.924
Still?

31:26.342 --> 31:27.427
Remember the play?

31:29.637 --> 31:31.431
<i>Angels in America.</i>

31:32.015 --> 31:33.808
Only you.

31:35.351 --> 31:37.103
Only you love me.

31:37.186 --> 31:40.023
Out of everyone in the world.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.070
Wait. How did you--

31:47.739 --> 31:51.409
-I was just drawn here.
-A Calling.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.537
Uh, we need to get Leo out of here ASAP.

31:54.621 --> 31:58.541
Let's just give them a minute.
Maybe send a picture of that to Olive.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.044
Mm.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.297
Hey, um, good news and bad news.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.674
Good news is that
we found the Omega Sapphire.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.344
That's incredible.
If it's as powerful as we think it is--

32:09.427 --> 32:11.554
<i>Bad news is that Eagan ran off with it.</i>

32:13.473 --> 32:15.642
But it could be the key to the Callings.
It could--

32:17.018 --> 32:20.021
<i>-We have to find it.</i>
I know. I'll… I'll find him.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.272
<i>I'll get it back.</i>

32:21.356 --> 32:23.066
I'll help. Anything you guys need.

32:24.233 --> 32:25.068
Yeah.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.238
Hey, we got this, buddy.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.616
We got this, buddy.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.994
I think it's time you go back up to bed.

32:39.207 --> 32:42.752
Hey, thank you, guys.
For getting Marko here. For everything.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.420
I should be thanking you.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.382
Came here looking for clarity today.
I think I found it.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.967
We should get Marko home.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.887
Oh. I think I just overdid it today.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.305
I got you.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.473
Wait.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.018
Marko.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.355
I wish there was more I could do for you.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.692
I sense Marko was happy to help us.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.445
Okay.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.368
Eden, honey, that's not yours to give.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.912
It's okay, Dad.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.665
Eden's right. He's supposed to have it.

33:21.582 --> 33:23.209
All right. Come on.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.930
Tarot cards and Masonic tiles.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.516
I'm amazed even now how things are so--

33:38.599 --> 33:40.101
Interconnected?

33:40.184 --> 33:41.811
-Yeah.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.816
No effing way.

33:49.318 --> 33:52.196
The goddess Maat, from my papyrus.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.824
It taught us that
you all were gonna be judged together.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.372
What is it, Ol?

34:06.377 --> 34:09.630
I keep losing everyone I love.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.924
I don't know if this helps right now,

34:12.925 --> 34:14.385
but you're not gonna lose me.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.096
How would you know that?

34:19.098 --> 34:20.892
How about we consult the tarot cards?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.437
Call this reading, uh,

34:24.520 --> 34:25.772
oracle tarot.

34:25.855 --> 34:26.981
You ready?

34:27.648 --> 34:31.444
Ask your most burning question,
my love, but pick wisely.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.112
Fate lies in your hands.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.391
Hey, don't worry, uh…

35:02.475 --> 35:06.604
The Death card is
all about spiritual transformation.

35:10.066 --> 35:10.900
Sure.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.404
Or it's that I'm about to lose Cal.

35:25.581 --> 35:27.917
Hey. You okay?

35:29.210 --> 35:30.711
I think I need that morphine now.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.296
Yeah, it's… it's right here.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.924
-Could you hand me that?
-Yeah.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.470
Thanks.

35:46.894 --> 35:47.937
There you go.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.625
I'll give you guys some space.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.965
You know I'll never give up on you.

36:16.674 --> 36:17.758
Whatever comes.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.220
I know.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.940
What's going on, Cal?

36:37.695 --> 36:38.779
Please.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.324
Just tell me.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.830
No more hiding.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.752
It's bad, Ol.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.004
No.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.008
No.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.764
No! No, please!

37:06.182 --> 37:07.808
Please, no!

37:16.234 --> 37:18.486
If it isn't the cat with nine lives.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.988
Poking your nose
where it don't belong again.

37:21.489 --> 37:22.573
This doesn't concern you.

37:22.657 --> 37:27.119
This facility's under Registry control.
Your ass is mine, Officer.

37:28.537 --> 37:30.373
That's detective, actually.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.501
I'm transferring to the Registry.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.710
Haven't you heard?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.550
All set.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.886
No jogging for a while.

37:43.970 --> 37:47.139
-You sure I can't pay you back?
-You can pay it forward.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.474
Thank you.

37:52.853 --> 37:53.938
Meet you in a sec.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.944
-Thank you.
-Come on. It was nothing.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.779
No, it's not just that.

38:02.363 --> 38:05.366
For Cal.
I wouldn't have trusted anybody else.

38:06.575 --> 38:11.122
I wanted to do more,
at least buy him more time.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.583
When something is precious,
you always want more.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.087
Any chance to keep it going.

39:31.702 --> 39:32.953
Cal, I'm so sorry.

39:33.662 --> 39:34.747
It's okay.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.166
But none of us are giving up.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.231
Alex!

40:01.690 --> 40:03.692
What's going on? Why are they still here?

40:04.443 --> 40:05.778
Oh my God.

40:06.779 --> 40:07.863
Dad!

40:09.323 --> 40:10.408
It's not just us.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.827
That's why they're here.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.955
Noah's Ark. The apocalyptic Callings.

40:16.038 --> 40:19.333
The Death Date isn't just
for the passengers. It's for everyone.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.335
It's for all. It's the whole world.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.753
We're all gonna die.

40:23.921 --> 40:24.922
Look!

40:26.507 --> 40:27.508
Eagan!

40:29.844 --> 40:30.678
Hey.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.555
Look at me. Eagan, look at me.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.098
Come on. Give me that sapphire.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.685
This is bigger than the Death Date!
This is bigger than 828.

40:37.768 --> 40:38.769
Eagan, please!

40:38.853 --> 40:40.187
Give us the sapphire!

40:42.898 --> 40:44.108
No! No, no!
