No. I'm not done yet, Dave.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.089
All right, so Alvin is a racehorse...

are his incredibly helpful jockey

down the racetrack of life.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.231
But if you hold the reins too tight,

05:57.324 --> 05:59.895
that racehorse is going to fight and buck,

05:59.993 --> 06:02.030
which is no fun for anyone.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.937
But if you loosen the
reins just a little...

blew it with the Chipettes

you're grounded!"

climbing up ropes, ever so stealthy,
from the side of the ship.

Come on, give it to me.
You could cut yourself.

So, I could have saved the whole ship
from robbage and pilgering

is coming in a hot-air balloon.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.687
Because those things are really quiet.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.582
I don't think Dave is gonna be
in a hot-air balloon.

24:42.681 --> 24:45.594
But he is coming, right?

24:45.684 --> 24:47.664
Of course he is.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.892
Just maybe not today.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.468
Alvin's right.
We should prepare to stay the night.

24:52.558 --> 24:56.131
What? You guys expect me
to sleep outside?

24:56.262 --> 24:58.765
Last I checked, Brit, we're chipmunks.

24:58.897 --> 25:00.706
We're used to living in the wild.

25:00.799 --> 25:03.780
No, we used to be used
to living in the wild.

25:03.902 --> 25:06.940
Come on, Brit, it's just one night.

25:07.072 --> 25:08.949
One cold night.

25:09.074 --> 25:13.113
So we'll make a fire. We're always
setting things on fire accidentally.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.954
How hard can it be
when we put our minds to it?

25:16.048 --> 25:17.994
And how are you intending to do that?

25:18.117 --> 25:22.031
I will create a spark by striking this rock
with my Swiss Army knife,

25:22.154 --> 25:24.760
which Dave took from me.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.063
(SNICKERS)

25:26.158 --> 25:28.604
I suppose you have a better idea,
smart guy?

25:29.061 --> 25:31.371
As a matter of fact, I do, smart guy.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.769
As you can see, the lens concentrates
the energy of the sun,

25:35.901 --> 25:37.972
thus creating fire!

25:40.039 --> 25:41.746
Whoa. Impressive.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.377
(AWKWARDLY) Thanks. Thank you.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.887
Thanks for thinking that.

25:47.846 --> 25:49.757
(SNIFFING)

25:50.749 --> 25:52.456
Hot, hot, hot! (YELPS)

25:55.320 --> 25:56.924
(SIGHING IN RELIEF)

26:00.159 --> 26:03.072
We have made fire!

26:03.162 --> 26:05.938
So, what do we do now?

26:08.600 --> 26:13.549
<i>(SINGING) Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya</i>

26:14.139 --> 26:18.087

<i>Oh, lord, Kumbaya</i>

26:30.422 --> 26:33.767
Alvin! Brittany!

26:35.527 --> 26:37.336
We've gotta head inland.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.202
If we climb to the top of that mountain,

26:40.299 --> 26:42.404
we'll be able to get
a better view of the island,

26:42.501 --> 26:44.174
see if they're here.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.340
All right, got it.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.543
What are you doing?

26:49.641 --> 26:51.518
- Building a fire.
- What?

26:51.610 --> 26:54.090
You know, one time in the studio,
Snoop ran out of matches,

26:54.179 --> 26:56.523
got a blaze going
with just two carrot sticks.

26:56.648 --> 26:57.956
Figure, how hard can it be?

26:58.951 --> 27:00.726
Forget the fire. We have to start hiking.

27:01.487 --> 27:05.833
Yeah, okay, Dave.
Look, it's getting dark-ish.

27:05.924 --> 27:08.461
It's gonna be cold. I'm gonna build a fire.
We'll go in the morning.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.597
- No, we'll go now.
(SHOUTING ANGRILY)

27:10.696 --> 27:12.698
Don't take that tone of voice
with me, Dave.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.971
I'm not one of your chipmunks
that you can just boss around

27:15.100 --> 27:16.602
and stuff into a cage
whenever you feel like it.

27:16.702 --> 27:17.942
That was you, Ian!

27:18.303 --> 27:20.078
Calm down.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.483
Jeez, no wonder those furballs
would rather fly off the ship

27:23.609 --> 27:25.816
than spend another day with you.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.924
They didn't do it on purpose.

27:28.013 --> 27:30.584
It was an accident. They're just kids.

27:32.718 --> 27:36.131
I don't know how long
they can survive out there.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.933
(SIGHS)

27:44.263 --> 27:47.733
ALVIN: And you guys were worried.
(LAUGHING) Look at us!

27:47.833 --> 27:52.748
We're warm, we got a great fire going,
beautiful night sky

27:52.838 --> 27:56.615
and if a rescue helicopter comes by,
they'll see us!

27:56.709 --> 27:58.620
Everything's gonna be fine.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.950
Good night, guys.

28:00.446 --> 28:03.017
- Good night.
- Good night.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.855
(YAWNS) Good night.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.828
Night.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.355
ALL: Theodore!

28:09.488 --> 28:13.026
What? Dave always turns off the light
after saying good night.

28:13.158 --> 28:16.037
That fire was sort of the only thing
keeping us from freezing to death.

28:16.161 --> 28:18.698
- Yeah!
- Can't you just relight it?

28:18.830 --> 28:22.471
- How?
- With your glasses. And the sun?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.238
Oh.

28:53.832 --> 28:57.302
- And what is this supposed to be?
- Breakfast!

28:57.402 --> 28:58.540
No, it's bark.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.511
Yeah, for breakfast!

it's not.

It's been forever
since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.

29:14.820 --> 29:15.992
Crazy suggestion, guys.

29:16.088 --> 29:19.399
Let's get off this beach
and let's find some real food.

29:20.893 --> 29:26.070
If I know my horticulture, and I do,
this is a grove of mango trees.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.543
Then where are all the mangoes?

29:28.634 --> 29:32.104
Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!

29:32.304 --> 29:34.079
(GROANS)

29:45.150 --> 29:48.029
You were planning on sharing that, right?

29:48.153 --> 29:50.429
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Of course.

29:50.522 --> 29:51.694
Oh, well, good.

29:51.823 --> 29:54.667
'Cause it kind of looked like
you were gonna eat it all by yourself.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.435
What? I would never do that.

- Jungle Monster.

And he never did.

Huh?

33:14.860 --> 33:18.637
Dave Henderson, my supervisor at UPS.

I used to fly cargo planes for them,

33:20.699 --> 33:23.737
until one day I crash-landed in the ocean.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.816
- We crash-landed, too.
- Really?

33:26.905 --> 33:30.182
But our Dave won't rest until he finds us.

33:30.275 --> 33:31.447
Right, Alvin?

33:31.543 --> 33:33.989
Absolutely. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Ooh, you know what,
you should put some ice on that.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.718
Oh, no, guys, I don't have any ice.
I live there in that tree.

- Yes!

35:55.420 --> 35:56.831
No. We do not.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.061
Listen, lady, maybe you
should just leave us alone

35:59.191 --> 36:01.865
so we can focus more on surviving
and less on killing ourselves.

anyone else getting hurt. Ow!

36:12.103 --> 36:13.605
Criminy. What was that?

36:13.738 --> 36:15.046
You know what, that was just a spider

36:15.140 --> 36:17.245
and they live here because this is nature.

36:17.375 --> 36:20.083
It is not just a spider,
it's a Phoneutria bahiensis.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.055
Its bite contains a neurotoxin.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.953
Ooh! Mr. Fancy Words. So what?

36:26.051 --> 36:29.089
Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?

36:29.187 --> 36:31.827
Oh. That's not good.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.904
Side effects include
changes in personality,

36:35.026 --> 36:38.098
loss of inhibition, dry mouth.

36:38.229 --> 36:41.733
Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably
twice a day by these little fellows

36:41.866 --> 36:43.777
and I am still completely normal.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.882
Yes, normal.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.882
Oh, no.

36:48.306 --> 36:49.785
DAVE: Alvin? Simon!

36:49.908 --> 36:51.888
Chubby one!

36:51.976 --> 36:53.819
Girl chubby one!

36:53.912 --> 36:56.085
Brittany? Jeanette?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.185
I hope they're okay.

36:59.284 --> 37:01.958
Who cares if they're okay?
I just need them to be here.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.994
And here I am thinking you've changed
and don't only care about yourself.

37:06.091 --> 37:08.571
Nope. And it's a good thing, too.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.004
Because right now the rage I'm feeling
for you and those chipmunks

37:11.096 --> 37:13.372
is the only thing keeping me going.

37:13.698 --> 37:14.699
Shall we keep going?

37:14.799 --> 37:17.541
Ian, just keep an eye out for something
to eat or drink, all right?

37:17.636 --> 37:19.547
All right. Right there!

37:20.071 --> 37:23.018
- Where?
- That thing around your neck.

37:23.108 --> 37:25.952
You're not gonna eat this.
This was a gift from Theodore.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.683
That explains it.
I was gonna say, it's really ugly.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.522
Like, really... Wow.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.486
- Ugly.
- It's not ugly.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.567
It goes with everything
and it's soft enough to sleep in.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.691
Yeah, and it's edible.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.933
You will not eat my son's necklace.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.303
He's not your son, Dave.
He's just a chipmunk.

37:53.838 --> 37:57.342
Oh, Dave. Where are you?

38:11.423 --> 38:13.494
Where are you, Alvin?

38:14.159 --> 38:15.661
IAN: All right.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.608
I'm gonna crash.

Who is this Simon you speak of?

39:14.819 --> 39:16.355
Um. you?

39:16.488 --> 39:19.833
No, my name is not Simon. It is

39:20.492 --> 39:21.994
Simone!

39:24.462 --> 39:26.408
That's pretty close to Simon.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.171
And yet completely different.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.643
Would you care to join me
on my adventure?

39:30.735 --> 39:32.009
What adventure?

39:32.103 --> 39:34.583
The adventure called life!

39:35.473 --> 39:36.474
Okay.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.915
But just until Dave shows up.

39:40.945 --> 39:42.652
Alvin, Alvin!

39:42.781 --> 39:44.192
Simon and Theodore are gone.

39:44.315 --> 39:48.457
They probably just went
to get stuff for the shelter.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.090
It's all the guy can talk about.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.635
Still, it's not like them
to wander off like that.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.261
Could you please go look for them?

39:55.360 --> 39:57.271
Why can't you?

39:57.362 --> 40:00.536
I have a situation of my own
to deal with, Alvin.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.178
Oh, right. How is Eleanor doing?

40:03.268 --> 40:06.442
Huh? She's fine. I'm talking about me.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.644
It's been two days since my last bath
and I am a mess.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.085
I can't get rescued looking like this.

40:13.778 --> 40:15.280
Oy.

Bonjour, my friend

40:29.928 --> 40:31.874
Simon? Are you bungee jumping?

40:31.963 --> 40:34.534
- His name is not Simon.
- It is Simone.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.935
That's pretty close to Simon.

40:37.035 --> 40:40.915
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But he's acting totally different.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.109
(CHUCKLES)

40:42.373 --> 40:45.479
The spider bite! That's it!
Remember the side effects?

40:45.577 --> 40:47.989
Personality changes, loss of inhibition?

40:48.079 --> 40:49.217
Lies! Who are you?

40:49.347 --> 40:52.123
Wow! Simone is pretty cool.

40:52.216 --> 40:55.288
It's Simon, Theodore. And, no, he's not.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.874
Okay, Theo, it's all you.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.442
Really? I've never done anything like this.

41:07.532 --> 41:08.875
And you never will.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.105
How can you let him do this?
What are you thinking?

41:11.202 --> 41:14.183
I'm thinking, "When did my dad
wash up on this island?"

41:14.305 --> 41:16.114
- What?
- We were having the best time.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.618
Why do you have to show up
and be so uptight?

41:18.243 --> 41:19.847
Me? Uptight?

41:19.978 --> 41:22.356
I'm not the uptight one, I'm the fun one!

41:53.311 --> 41:57.157

And I also made these for you, Eleanor.

Oh, look how handy you are all of a sudden.

42:01.653 --> 42:05.829

- Spider venom.

- Oui?

get to work on that shelter.

a better roof over our heads

42:48.599 --> 42:50.169
than the stars in the sky.

42:50.301 --> 42:53.578
What about the kind of roof
over our head that's actually a roof?

42:53.671 --> 42:54.911
It's going to rain!

42:55.039 --> 42:57.349
What is a little rain? Hmm?

gonna build a shelter.

43:13.558 --> 43:16.732
I'll try. But I feel so useless.

- What I've wanted to do

Wait a second. You actually think
I'm in this for the money?

Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks,
you're doing a lousy job.

50:24.855 --> 50:27.665
Oh, no. This is terrible.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.396
Shouldn't he have come up by now?

50:29.493 --> 50:32.497
Uh-oh. Simone! Where are you?

50:32.596 --> 50:34.576
Zoe, you've gotta do something.

50:34.698 --> 50:35.972
All right.

50:36.067 --> 50:39.014
Callaway, I need you to go in there
and find Simone.

50:39.103 --> 50:40.673
I know you can do it, little buddy.

50:47.378 --> 50:48.789
You're kidding, right?

50:49.380 --> 50:52.156
If Callaway can't find him, nobody can.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

50:54.685 --> 50:56.358
(GASPS) Simone!

50:56.687 --> 50:57.688

50:57.788 --> 51:00.769
I'm sorry if I caused you
any worry, <i>mademaiselle</i>.

51:00.891 --> 51:05.670
But I have something for you.
Maybe this will be a way to make it up.

51:05.796 --> 51:08.367
Oh! it's beautiful!

51:08.766 --> 51:10.643

51:10.734 --> 51:13.613
Yeah, it is beautiful.
Where did you find it?

51:14.371 --> 51:16.044
In a cave behind the waterfall.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.712
I thought it would look nice on you.

51:18.809 --> 51:23.087
But now I realize even the most precious
gem cannot compare to your beauty.

51:26.417 --> 51:27.725
BOTH: Aw!

51:28.285 --> 51:31.892
Yeah. Were there any other jewels
or gems or diamonds

51:31.989 --> 51:33.229
or anything else in there?

51:33.324 --> 51:34.962
By the time I found the gold,

51:35.092 --> 51:38.232
I had already been gone
from my Jeanette far too long.

51:38.329 --> 51:39.967
Aw!

51:40.064 --> 51:41.372
What?

51:44.301 --> 51:46.941
You guys, they found it. They found it!

51:47.071 --> 51:49.051
And the best part is,
they don't even know what they found.

51:49.139 --> 51:50.982
They think that it's just one bracelet.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.588
Which means that
the rest of the treasure is mine.

51:53.677 --> 51:55.953
All mine! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

Yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.

52:16.266 --> 52:18.109
You just take what you want.

You mess with me, ése,

I'll go loco on you.

Whoa! Hey!

52:29.914 --> 52:31.689

Okay, Brit, I'm all done.

52:49.233 --> 52:52.305
If you want, I can help you get started...

Whoa!

52:56.106 --> 52:59.781
This tree house is awesome.

52:59.877 --> 53:02.084
Maybe you are kind of the smart one.

53:02.212 --> 53:04.317
Thank you, Alvin. And yours is...

Well,

Anyhoo, no reason we can't be
comfortable and stylish

53:14.892 --> 53:16.769
Brit, I...

53:16.861 --> 53:20.707
I think I know why Dave hasn't come.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.641
You do? Why?

53:22.733 --> 53:24.974
'Cause he's not even looking.

53:26.136 --> 53:29.583
Alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?

53:29.673 --> 53:32.711
Because I drive him crazy.

You know, the way Simon's
been driving me crazy?

53:36.380 --> 53:39.293
I mean, that's what I've
been doing to Dave.

53:39.383 --> 53:41.192

No wonder he hates me.

53:50.094 --> 53:51.664
I'm sure Dave will come.

53:51.762 --> 53:56.006
I mean, he certainly loves
Simon and Theodore.

54:11.015 --> 54:13.552
Yes! About Dave!

54:19.390 --> 54:22.530
And I hate to see you sad.

54:22.626 --> 54:25.869
I will help you find your friend Dave.

54:25.963 --> 54:28.170
You really think you can find him?

54:28.265 --> 54:29.437
I know I can!

54:31.068 --> 54:34.311
And then I will find this Simon
you keep speaking of!

Well, he's very kind and
a good storyteller.

55:47.645 --> 55:49.921
Mmm-hmm. Very helpful.

55:50.013 --> 55:53.392
Oh! And he's about this tall.

55:53.484 --> 55:54.792
Mmm-hmm.

55:54.885 --> 55:58.697
Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?

55:59.089 --> 56:00.397
I don't think so.

56:01.191 --> 56:04.502
Then these footprints must not be his.

Maybe you're right.
Maybe no one's coming.

56:41.732 --> 56:44.645
Maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all.
Maybe they're gone.

56:47.438 --> 56:49.509
I really messed up.
