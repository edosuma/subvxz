WEBVTT

00:34.743 --> 00:36.202
SO VICTOR,

00:36.286 --> 00:39.956
{\an4}IT'S BACK TO GOOD OLD FASHIONED
ROOM SEARCHES AND PEERING
THROUGH KEYHOLES, EH?

00:40.039 --> 00:43.460
{\an1}DON'T YOU HAVE CLASSES
TO GO TO?

00:43.543 --> 00:46.796
HEY VICTOR! HAVE A NICE DAY!

00:49.007 --> 00:51.968
{\an1}I MAY NOT HAVE MY CAMERAS
ANY MORE.

00:52.051 --> 00:58.433
{\an1}BUT I'M STILL WATCHING YOU,
REMEMBER THAT.

01:11.070 --> 01:15.492
{\an4}GUYS, GUYS, I WOKE UP EARLY
THIS MORNING AND WENT BACK
DOWN UNDER THE STAIRS,

01:15.575 --> 01:19.245
AND I FOUND THIS.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.290
HG WELLS - 'THE TIME MACHINE'?

01:22.373 --> 01:25.001
YEAH. IT'S "BELEATHERED"
LIKE IT SAYS IN THE CLUE.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.503
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME TRAVEL

01:26.586 --> 01:29.923
{\an4}SO IT COULD BE "THE ONLY PLACE
WHERE YESTERDAY ALWAYS FOLLOWS
TOMORROW"?

01:30.006 --> 01:32.091
YES! WHAT DID YOU FIND?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.635
ACTUALLY NOTHING. YET.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.345
BUT IF IT'S THERE, I WILL!

01:35.428 --> 01:39.766
AMBER WANTS TO SEE THE PHOTO
OF "VICTOR THE EVER-LIVING."

01:41.726 --> 01:45.188
THAT IS SOOOO CREEPY.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.856
IT GETS EVEN CREEPIER.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.025
{\an1}THERE ARE TWO OR THREE OTHER
ONES, ALL FROM DIFFERENT YEARS.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.903
{\an1}AND THAT SAME VICTOR IS
ON THEM ALL.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.949
{\an1}DO YOU THINK HE'S A GHOST OR
I DON'T KNOW... A VAMPIRE?

01:56.032 --> 01:57.867
NO, AMBER, I DO NOT.

01:57.951 --> 02:04.207
{\an5}ALTHOUGH, I DO THINK IT'S
CONFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE
OF... AN ELIXIR OF LIFE.

02:05.291 --> 02:09.086
{\an1}OKAY, SO NOW WE'VE GOT PROOF,
CAN WE GO TELL SOMEONE?

02:09.169 --> 02:13.216
PLEASE. THIS IS JUST
GETTING TOO SCARY...

02:13.299 --> 02:15.969
{\an1}WE HAVE GOT THE PHOTOS TO
BACK IT UP..?

02:16.052 --> 02:17.011
WHO DO WE SHOW THEM TO?

02:17.095 --> 02:18.596
IT'S NOT ENOUGH PROOF.
PHOTOS CAN BE DOCTORED.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.640
FABIAN'S RIGHT.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.059
{\an1}WE NEED TO GET OUR HANDS ON
THE ELIXIR ITSELF.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.435
{\an1}THAT MEANS GOING BACK DOWN
TO THE CELLAR.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.231
{\an4}IF IT MEANS GOING INTO THE
CELLAR AGAIN THEN THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.860
{\an5}WE'LL GO BACK, WE'LL STEAL
SOME OF THE STUFF, BRING IT
BACK AND GET IT ANALYSED.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.904
{\an1}DON'T WORRY. I'LL DO IT
MYSELF.

02:34.988 --> 02:39.576
{\an1}NO. WE STICK TOGETHER. I'M
COMING WITH YOU.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.662
I'M COMING TOO.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.831
SIBUNA, AMBER?

02:44.914 --> 02:48.251
{\an1}COME ON. YOU STARTED THIS
CLUB.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.752
YOU NAMED IT AND EVERYTHING.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.964
IT'S NOT THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.134
SIBUNA.

02:56.217 --> 02:59.846
(Together) SIBUNA

03:05.268 --> 03:06.394
YES. YES. OH YES.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.980
WHAT?

03:09.063 --> 03:12.692
{\an4}WE, BUDDY, HAVE JUST BEEN
OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
'BEST PRANK OF THE YEAR'.

03:12.775 --> 03:13.776
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.279
I WAS OUT WITH MICK.

03:16.362 --> 03:20.283
{\an4}AGAIN? YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME TOGETHER THESE DAYS
AREN'T YOU?

03:20.366 --> 03:23.036
{\an1}I'M HELPING HIM WITH HIS
TRAINING THAT'S ALL.

03:23.119 --> 03:26.331
{\an4}I'M SEEING HIM AGAIN AFTER
SCHOOL AT THREE, AND THEN
TOMORROW AT 9.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.584
{\an1}BE CAREFUL MARA. HE'S A
HEART-BREAKER.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.003
{\an1}NO HE'S NOT, HE'S A
SWEETHEART DEEP DOWN.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.839
{\an1}JUST LIKE HE'S SMART DEEP
DOWN.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.634
GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.636
LISTEN, BEFORE WE
START TODAY'S CLASS,

03:39.719 --> 03:43.097
{\an4}I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR
ATTENTION TO THIS SHEET OF
PAPER ON THE WALL HERE.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.600
{\an4}ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN
AUDITIONING FOR THE SCHOOL
PLAY,

03:45.683 --> 03:47.936
{\an4}SIGN YOUR AUTOGRAPH UP THERE.
AMBER, NINA HOW ARE YOU DOING
WITH THE SCRIPT?

03:48.019 --> 03:52.148
{\an1}NINA'S ALL OVER IT. RIGHT
NINA?

03:52.231 --> 03:54.275
{\an1}I'VE WRITTEN SOME OF THE
EARLY SCENES.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.820
{\an1}BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE
WINKLER- WORTHY YET.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.657
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT OKAY?
IT'S ALL WORK IN PROGRESS.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.826
{\an4}BUT I WOULD LIKE TO START
AUDITIONING FROM NEXT WEEK
IF THAT'S OKAY.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.411
NEXT WEEK?

04:05.495 --> 04:06.454
I'M SURE IT'LL BE GREAT.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.039
{\an1}I'M NOT. I'VE GONE WITH THE
WHOLE SARAH THEME.

04:08.122 --> 04:12.293
{\an1}BUT, I JUST HOPE I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.423
AND STOP!

04:18.841 --> 04:22.387
DUDE YOU'RE TOUGH.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.640
{\an4}THE MORE WE IMPROVE YOUR
LUNG CAPACITY, THE BETTER
YOUR STAMINA.

04:25.723 --> 04:29.143
THAT'S GOOD.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.853
{\an1}I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD THIS
SIDE.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.190
{\an1}THIS VERY VERY CRUEL SIDE.
HA HA HA.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.484
{\an1}WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ME TO BE
LIKE?

04:36.567 --> 04:39.487
I DON'T KNOW. LIKE MARA.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.656
AND WHAT'S MARA LIKE?

04:41.739 --> 04:45.410
{\an1}BRIGHT. STUDIOUS. SENSIBLE.
HUMANE.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.370
SENSIBLE!
(Mick laughs)

04:47.453 --> 04:49.038
I'LL GIVE YOU SENSIBLE.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.708
{\an1}I WANT 400 METRES OUT
OF YOU NOW.

04:51.791 --> 04:56.629
{\an1}AND I WANT IT TO BE A NEW
PERSONAL BEST.

05:04.679 --> 05:10.476
(Humming)

05:10.560 --> 05:11.728
YOU'RE BACK!

05:11.811 --> 05:13.271
AH IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!

05:13.354 --> 05:14.564
TRUDY YOU'RE BACK!

05:14.647 --> 05:17.233
{\an1}CAREFUL, SWEETIE... YOU'LL
BREAK MY RIBS!

05:17.316 --> 05:20.611
{\an1}TRUDY TRUDY TRUDY TRUDY TRUDY!
I'M SO PLEASED TO SEE YOU!

05:20.695 --> 05:22.155
WELCOME HOME, TRUDY.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.448
WE'VE REALLY MISSED YOU.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.283
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
JUST HOW MUCH.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.578
{\an1}SERIOUSLY, WE'VE ALL LOST
WEIGHT. WELCOME HOME!

05:28.661 --> 05:30.204
CAN I HELP YOU WITH
DINNER TONIGHT?

05:30.288 --> 05:33.374
OR CLEANING, ANYTHING, I'VE
JUST MISSED YOU SOOOOO MUCH.

05:33.458 --> 05:38.379
{\an1}THANK YOU, SWEETIE, BUT NO
SCHOOL WORK COMES FIRST.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.383
TRUDY.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.136
VICTOR.

05:45.219 --> 05:49.599
THE HALL IS NOT A
LOUNGING AREA.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.611
A WORD TO THE WISE TRUDY.

06:01.694 --> 06:06.657
{\an4}I DON'T WANT YOU LISTENING
TO THE STUDENTS' LITTLE
CONSPIRACY THEORIES AGAIN.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.992
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

06:08.076 --> 06:12.121
{\an4}IT'S JUST THEY SEEMED SO
CONVINCED THAT SOMETHING WAS
GOING ON.

06:12.205 --> 06:12.997
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.708
YES. OVER ACTIVE
IMAGINATIONS.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.461
PRECISELY.

06:18.544 --> 06:22.590
{\an1}SO, CAN WE PUT ALL THAT
BEHIND US?

06:22.673 --> 06:23.925
START AGAIN?

06:24.008 --> 06:26.803
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.305
{\an1}OH GOOD. OH THANK-YOU
VICTOR.

06:29.388 --> 06:34.268
{\an1}YOU KNOW I THINK THE WORLD
OF THIS PLACE.

06:34.352 --> 06:38.231
JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
AND DO YOUR WORK.

06:38.314 --> 06:42.693
YES. HEAD DOWN. DO MY WORK.

06:45.154 --> 06:48.950
COME ON! COME ON, MICK! KEEP
PUSHING. YOU'RE NEARLY THERE!

06:49.033 --> 06:53.746
{\an1}COME ON! DON'T BE SUCH A LADY!
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!

06:55.706 --> 06:56.332
DID I DO IT?

06:56.415 --> 06:57.625
A NEW RECORD. BY TWO
SECONDS!

06:57.708 --> 07:00.795
YES!!!

07:10.930 --> 07:19.814
{\an1}(all chanting)
TRUDY! TRUDY! TRUDY! TRUDY!

07:19.897 --> 07:21.190
FOR YOU TRUDY.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.820
{\an1}WE'RE ALL SO PLEASED TO HAVE
YOU BACK.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.322
STOP IT YOU GUYS.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.242
DON'T CRY. COOK!

07:31.325 --> 07:36.330
{\an4}WE RECKON VICTOR GOT INTO SOME
SERIOUS TROUBLE FROM SWEET AND
ANDREWS FOR FIRING YOU.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.498
{\an1}DON'T BE DISRESPECTFUL,
FABIAN.

07:37.582 --> 07:41.085
I'M SURE VICTOR THOUGHT HE
WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.170
{\an1}TIME TO PUT YOUR FEET UP,
TRUDY.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.547
{\an1}WE'LL FINISH THIS WON'T WE
MARA?

07:44.630 --> 07:45.506
YEP.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.925
{\an1}AND ALFIE IS GOING TO MAKE
YOU A CUP OF TEA.

07:48.009 --> 07:48.885
AM I?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.052
DOES HE HAVE TO?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.514
{\an1}HEY, IT WAS JUST A TINY FIRE
LAST TIME.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.226
{\an4}AND I BOUGHT YOU SOME CAKE
TRUDY. IT'S NOT AS NICE AS
YOURS.

07:57.310 --> 08:01.189
THAT LOOKS LOVELY
SWEETHEART.

08:01.272 --> 08:05.067
IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.704
{\an1}SO WHAT'S WITH THE SECRET
SMILE?

08:16.787 --> 08:18.748
{\an1}I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT ON
CLOUD NINE.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.041
OH YEAH?

08:20.124 --> 08:21.751
{\an1}(Whispers) WE KIND OF
KISSED.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.335
{\an3}UH OH.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.046
ARE YOU NOT HAPPY FOR ME?

08:25.129 --> 08:27.256
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE HIS
TYPE.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.885
{\an1}HE'S NOT GOING TO DATE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING IN COMMON.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.429
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU EVEN TALK ABOUT?
HIS TRAINING PROGRAMME?

08:34.514 --> 08:38.808
RIVETING. DON'T GET ME
WRONG. I LIKE MICK.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.852
BUT HE'S NOT EXACTLY AN
INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGE.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.190
{\an1}HE'S VERY SWEET AND KIND AND
HE'S GOT A BIG HEART AND

08:44.273 --> 08:45.107
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.194
I DON'T WANT THIS TO
END IN TEARS.

08:48.277 --> 08:52.698
{\an1}SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME SUCH
AN EXPERT ON RELATIONSHIPS?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.826
{\an4}I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
FRIENDS ARE HONEST WITH EACH
OTHER.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.662
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

08:57.745 --> 08:59.205
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.083
WHATEVER.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.939
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.649
IT'S ALL BACK IN PLACE.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.985
HE MAY BE CREEPY,
BUT HE IS GOOD.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.320
EVEN THE STUFFED CAT. UGH!

09:31.404 --> 09:36.534
RIGHT, WE KNOW WHY
WE CAME HERE.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.662
LET'S GET SEARCHING.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.581
{\an1}IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.053
(Loud clang)
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:56.637 --> 09:59.056
NOTHING.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
VICTOR HAS BEEN BUSY.

10:04.937 --> 10:09.358
WHICH ONE IS IT?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.152
{\an1}THIS WAS THE ONE I SAW
HIM DRINKING.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.611
ARE YOU SURE?

10:12.695 --> 10:16.532
AS I CAN BE.
IT LOOKS THE SAME.

10:16.615 --> 10:20.036
{\an4}(loud wailing)
I REALLY HOPE THAT WAS
ANOTHER CAT.

10:20.119 --> 10:24.332
HERE PUSS..?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.627
AMBER, I DON'T THINK.

10:32.381 --> 10:36.344
(All scream)

10:38.429 --> 10:43.434
(All screaming)

10:49.315 --> 10:53.069
(Laughing)

10:55.988 --> 10:58.949
{\an1}GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.035
{\an1}I TRUST EVERYONE SLEPT WELL
LAST NIGHT?

11:01.118 --> 11:02.495
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

11:02.578 --> 11:05.206
I JUST CARE. SLEEP IS AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF LIFE.

11:05.289 --> 11:08.084
{\an1}SO TELL ME, DID ANYONE HEAR
THAT CAT LAST NIGHT?

11:08.167 --> 11:13.631
{\an4}IT SOUNDED LIKE A
COMBINATION OF A VERY OLD
GOAT AND A SCREAMING BABY.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.174
THAT WASN'T A CAT.
IT WAS ME.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.803
{\an4}AND YOU'D SCREAM TOO IF YOU
GOT CORNERED BY A PAIR OF
ZOMBIES.

11:18.886 --> 11:19.136
(together) AMBER!

11:19.220 --> 11:22.098
SORRY.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.601
{\an5}AND ONCE AGAIN, WE ENTER THE
STRANGE AND UNPREDICTABLE
WORLD THAT IS AMBER'S MIND.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.230
{\an5}BUT JEROME, YOU MUST HAVE
HEARD THE RUMOURS OF WHAT'S
BURIED DOWN IN THE CELLAR.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.440
YES I HAVE.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.609
{\an1}THE TWO TEACHERS WHO WERE
BURIED ALIVE?

11:33.692 --> 11:37.279
{\an4}YOU CAN HEAR THEIR STOMACHS
RUMBLING AND AT NIGHT THEY
COME OUT AND EAT YOUR BRAINS!

11:37.363 --> 11:39.031
ALFIE!!!

11:39.115 --> 11:40.658
THINK WE FOUND OUR ZOMBIES.

11:40.741 --> 11:44.245
{\an1}YOU PIG! I'VE NEVER BEEN SO
SCARED IN MY WHOLE LIFE!

11:44.328 --> 11:47.289
{\an1}EXCEPT THAT TIME WHEN MY DAD
FROZE MY ALLOWANCE.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.501
AMBER. ROAR!!!

11:50.584 --> 11:53.838
{\an4}YOU THINK YOU'RE REALLY
FUNNY DON'T YOU? WELL,
YOU'RE NOT.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.257
LIGHTEN UP. IT WAS A JOKE.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.301
{\an1}WHAT WERE YOU DOING DOWN
THERE ANYWAY?

12:00.469 --> 12:05.558
{\an1}OOOH! HAVEN'T THEY GONE
QUIET ALL OF A SUDDEN ALFIE?

12:05.641 --> 12:09.478
MORNING, MICK. AND OTHERS.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.565
HI MARA.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.444
{\an1}I REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE
VICTOR RELATED ZOMBIES.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.736
ME TOO.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.281
PART OF HIS, EXPERIMENTS.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.824
OR FAMILY MEMBERS?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.160
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
THEY WERE ZOMBIES.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.828
(Laughs) OKAY.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.079
{\an3}YEAH RIGHT.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.916
YOU WERE SCREAMING
LOUDER THAN US.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.002
{\an1}WE STILL NEED TO GET THE
ELIXIR ANALYSED.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.753
I SAY WE GIVE IT
TO THE POLICE.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.005
AND THE PHOTOS, AND
THE RECORDINGS.

12:36.088 --> 12:40.509
{\an1}WE CAN'T. THEY'RE IN IT WITH
VICTOR AND HIS SPOOKY FRIENDS.
