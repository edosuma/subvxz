01:01.645 --> 01:04.230
<i>You once told me that
you would do anything for Jericho.</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:07.276
<i>Then here's your chance.</i>

01:08.402 --> 01:10.654
<i>All you have to do is say "yes."</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:17.578
Just say "yes,"
and everything will be okay.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.706
I will give you everything that you want.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.668
Just say "yes."

01:33.135 --> 01:34.595
I need a moment alone.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.980
Why don't you two go wait in the car?

01:44.980 --> 01:46.398
- No.
- You're fucking kidding me.

01:46.398 --> 01:49.193
You're not safe with her.
You have no idea what she's done.

01:49.193 --> 01:52.070
For all we know, she could have
the stolen baby hidden in the house.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.323
I don't.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.577
She's right.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.294
There's no baby here.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.180
I know her as well as you do.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.351
I'll be fine.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.024
All right.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.526
Jesus. You're not serious.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.530
We have to start trusting her.

02:37.616 --> 02:41.078
We'll be right outside if you need us.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.830
Come on.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.219
Dorothy.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.517
Dorothy.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.274
Dorothy, look at me.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.532
What are you?

03:21.827 --> 03:22.828
Doesn't matter.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.081
I'm yours.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.628
And now you don't have to hurt anymore.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.716
And we can be happy again.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.803
Can't.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.399
But you need me.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.652
Dorothy!

03:56.904 --> 03:59.198
I'll be better. I promise I--

04:01.617 --> 04:03.285
Don't you want him back?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.470
<i>On the roads and highways,
we are seeing widespread flash flooding,</i>

05:03.470 --> 05:06.890
<i>and the reports of storm damage
just keep coming in.</i>

05:30.914 --> 05:33.208
I'm not afraid of you anymore!

05:34.751 --> 05:37.379
There's nothing else
that you can do to me.

05:39.590 --> 05:43.051
This was the one thing that I wanted!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.888
Why couldn't I have it?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.273
Leanne!

06:01.820 --> 06:02.821
Leanne!

06:10.329 --> 06:11.163
Leanne!

06:13.165 --> 06:15.000
I know that was my son.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.795
I know you gave him back to me.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.927
But I can't let you do it again.

06:24.927 --> 06:28.722
Do you think I was wrong?
Do you think I'm evil?

06:28.722 --> 06:33.352
No. It was the kindest thing anyone
has ever done for me.

06:34.102 --> 06:39.858
I would have given anything
to have had him for one more minute.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.362
And you gave me months with him.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.034
And this pain that I feel now...

06:51.495 --> 06:54.248
that's a part of my love for him too.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.793
I need to feel it.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.633
You're not evil.

07:06.552 --> 07:07.553
I am.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.431
I'm bad.
You don't know how bad I really am.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.101
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I know you.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.022
When our kitchen caught fire in Wisconsin,

07:19.022 --> 07:24.528
I ran and I hid in my room
because I knew that the fire was my fault.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.114
And I knew I would be punished.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.618
And I heard my parents screaming.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.246
And I could have helped them,
but I didn't.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.707
- You were scared. You were a little girl.
- No. No.

07:36.707 --> 07:40.169
For the first time in my life,
I was happy.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.839
Because I wanted them to die.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.801
And the last thing I remember
was Uncle George taking me away.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.720
He brought me back.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.140
But I didn't deserve it.

07:53.140 --> 07:57.227
I'll never be good enough for him.
I'll never be forgiven.

07:57.227 --> 08:00.647
And I'm fucking sick,
and I'm tired of trying to be--

08:00.647 --> 08:02.065
Can you forgive me?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.195
A mother who killed her own child?

08:07.696 --> 08:08.906
You made a mistake.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.491
I don't care what you've done.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.995
I know your heart.

08:18.874 --> 08:23.337
I met you when you were that little girl.
Do you remember?

08:25.339 --> 08:27.633
You should have been loved.

08:28.217 --> 08:32.554
I would have been so proud
to have a daughter like you.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.106
It's too late, Dorothy.
I don't know how to stop this.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.275
You saved me.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.488
- This is all my fault.
- No.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.490
I'm too dangerous to be around.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.493
Let's please go inside.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.790
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

09:10.843 --> 09:15.013
<i>The Schuylkill River seems to
have exceeded the hundred-year flood zone.</i>

09:15.013 --> 09:18.559
<i>And that, of course, is causing closures
all along the Schuylkill Expressway.</i>

09:18.559 --> 09:20.143
<i>Downed wires, and now...</i>

09:20.143 --> 09:22.980
If Dorothy's not back
in five minutes, I'm going in to get her.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.732
<i>...incredibly
unanticipated storm. Potentially fatal.</i>

09:26.275 --> 09:27.901
We get it. It's Armageddon.

09:30.863 --> 09:31.905
You're leaking.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.576
Shit. Your stitches must have ripped out.

09:39.997 --> 09:40.998
Fuck.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.460
Don't move.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.381
It's Brunello.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.342
This is what love looks like.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.468
Thanks.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.889
We have to get you to the hospital.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.724
The fuck is taking them so long?

10:05.898 --> 10:07.107
I do forgive you.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.738
And Jericho forgives you too.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.260
<i>People are beginning
to abandon their vehicles</i>

10:35.260 --> 10:36.929
<i>as the streets continue to flood.</i>

10:36.929 --> 10:39.598
- <i>If you haven't made it inside yet...</i>
- Hold this. I'm going in.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.766
<i>...do so immediately.</i>

10:40.766 --> 10:41.850
They're here.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.232
We need to go back to the hospital
for Sean before the roads close.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.192
What? What happened?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.485
Nothing. I'm fine.

10:55.989 --> 10:56.990
Get in.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.576
I think I should stay.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.080
You don't need me to come with you.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.581
It's not safe, Leanne.

11:05.374 --> 11:09.419
We don't want you to get stranded here.
Let us help you. Come on.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.463
Come.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.345
I just have to get something
that Uncle George left for me, okay?

11:21.265 --> 11:22.516
Take care of them for me.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.868
<i>Thank you very much, Walker.
Now, this storm is highly peculiar.</i>

11:40.868 --> 11:43.328
<i>It appeared seemingly
out of nowhere last night,</i>

11:43.328 --> 11:46.498
<i>and has only been growing in intensity.
Not only that,</i>

11:46.498 --> 11:51.211
<i>but the sudden storm seems to be localized
primarily over the city of Philadelphia</i>

11:51.211 --> 11:53.172
<i>and doesn't seem to be going anywhere.</i>

11:53.172 --> 11:54.423
<i>That's right.</i>

11:54.423 --> 11:58.594
<i>In fact, our meteorologist says
it's only getting bigger and bigger,</i>

11:58.594 --> 12:01.013
<i>spreading into neighboring counties.</i>

12:01.597 --> 12:03.682
<i>And we've just received word
of an accident</i>

12:03.682 --> 12:07.186
<i>that's caused a massive pileup on 676--</i>

12:11.148 --> 12:12.357
I'm really sorry.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.996
I really hope you'll be proud of me.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.126
<i>Good night to Melanie,</i>

12:31.126 --> 12:34.796
<i>who has gone home a little early today
to be with her family.</i>

12:34.796 --> 12:37.758
<i>I'll be staying here to give you
minute to minute coverage, though,</i>

12:37.758 --> 12:40.469
<i>on this now record-breaking storm.</i>

12:40.469 --> 12:42.095
<i>This is no joke, folks.</i>

12:42.095 --> 12:43.764
<i>Half of Philly have lost power</i>

12:43.764 --> 12:46.433
<i>and authorities
are left scratching their heads</i>

12:46.433 --> 12:49.019
<i>as to how no one
could have seen this coming.</i>

12:49.019 --> 12:51.563
<i>Again...</i>

13:30.018 --> 13:31.854
This is completely fucking insane.

13:31.854 --> 13:35.023
We should be going now.
None of us are safe here.

13:37.401 --> 13:38.402
Are you okay to wait?

13:42.531 --> 13:43.866
Let's give it another minute.

14:00.674 --> 14:05.512
<i>Hey, Leanne. So weird.
I was just thinking about you.</i>

14:06.013 --> 14:07.431
Do you think about me a lot?

14:09.766 --> 14:12.519
<i>Well,
I was gonna call you after work today</i>

14:12.519 --> 14:14.938
<i>and see if you maybe wanted
to go out sometime.</i>

14:17.441 --> 14:18.442
I'd love to.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.570
<i>Okay. Great.</i>

14:23.864 --> 14:24.948
What do you wanna do?

14:24.948 --> 14:28.368
<i>We'd go to this restaurant
where you cook your own pizza.</i>

14:28.368 --> 14:30.204
<i>I swear it's fun.</i>

14:30.204 --> 14:32.456
<i>And if you don't want
to do that, we can go mini golfing.</i>

14:33.165 --> 14:34.166
Let's do both.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.044
<i>Okay, sure. Let's do both.</i>

14:38.962 --> 14:40.339
What should we do after?

14:40.339 --> 14:44.218
<i>After, we could go get some gelato</i>

14:44.218 --> 14:47.804
<i>and maybe walk by the river
if it's not too cold?</i>

14:47.804 --> 14:51.058
<i>But if it is too cold, I will, of course,
give you my jacket</i>

14:51.058 --> 14:52.392
<i>because I'm a gentleman.</i>

14:54.686 --> 14:55.771
Let's go tomorrow.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.106
<i>Okay. Yeah</i>.

14:59.066 --> 15:03.237
<i>Although I don't know
if it'll still be raining tomorrow.</i>

15:03.237 --> 15:06.240
<i>I mean, this storm is insane. Do you
hear they're closing some roads down?</i>

15:09.868 --> 15:11.328
It won't be raining tomorrow.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.915
<i>Okay, then. Tomorrow. It's a date.</i>

15:17.626 --> 15:19.670
<i>Listen,
I should be getting back into work.</i>

15:19.670 --> 15:23.507
<i>But I'm really glad that you called, Leanne.</i>

15:24.091 --> 15:25.092
Me too.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.970
<i>Bye.</i>

15:27.970 --> 15:29.054
Bye.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.603
<i>If you haven't done it already,
we encourage you. We urge you.</i>

15:36.603 --> 15:38.355
<i>Please.</i>

15:42.860 --> 15:45.028
I used to try really hard
to make you happy.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.489
But it was never enough.

15:48.657 --> 15:52.786
But it's okay
because I have a new mother now.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.706
And I don't need anything
from you anymore.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.586
I Wish that I could ask you something now.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.425
What does it feel like...

16:09.136 --> 16:10.179
when you burn?

16:32.201 --> 16:35.579
This is fucking nonsense. I'm going in.

16:46.965 --> 16:47.966
Leanne!

16:57.184 --> 16:58.602
Drive around back.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.907
I'm at 9780 Spruce Street
and the whole building is on fire.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.242
Someone's trapped inside.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.163
9780 Spruce Street.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.916
What-- Please hurry. She's inside.

17:31.927 --> 17:33.011
- Leanne!
- Leanne!

17:33.011 --> 17:35.430
Holy fucking shit!
Julian, don't get too close!

17:36.056 --> 17:38.141
Oh, my fucking-- Oh, my God!

17:38.767 --> 17:40.644
Shit! Dorothy, don't come here! Stay back.

17:40.644 --> 17:41.937
Oh, my God. Leanne.

17:42.521 --> 17:43.522
Stay back.

18:05.586 --> 18:06.837
You did this!

18:08.338 --> 18:09.464
No, Mr. Turner.

18:10.382 --> 18:11.884
We tried, but we couldn't.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.136
She had to do this herself.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.138
She made her own choice.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.308
She has chosen to save us all.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.020
That's a nasty injury.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.523
Hospital said your stitches ripped
while all this was happening.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.361
You gonna be all right to answer
some questions?

22:41.862 --> 22:43.864
Yeah,
I'll tell ya anything you wanna know.

22:43.864 --> 22:46.909
The fire department
couldn't determine the source.

22:46.909 --> 22:48.660
All they know is that it grew fast.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.663
Guessing it was a gas leak of some kind.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.750
Have you had these types of issues before?

22:56.335 --> 22:57.503
It's an old house.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.631
You waiting for someone?

23:01.548 --> 23:02.633
The body bag.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.303
Well, we haven't found any remains yet.

23:06.303 --> 23:08.555
Are you sure someone was in there?

23:12.267 --> 23:13.936
Do you have a place to stay tonight?

23:15.312 --> 23:16.813
Yeah, I booked us a hotel.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.150
Think of it as a blank slate.

23:20.651 --> 23:22.152
You'll get compensation.

23:22.152 --> 23:24.154
You can do the place up really nice again.

23:24.154 --> 23:26.240
Fix all those things
that bugged you before.

23:29.910 --> 23:31.411
I don't think we're coming back.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.748
I remember you.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.210
You were there that day.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.715
The day my son died.

23:45.259 --> 23:46.510
You were kind to me.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.221
Thank you.

23:50.848 --> 23:51.849
I think...

23:53.851 --> 23:54.852
maybe...

23:57.521 --> 23:59.273
the dead are always with us.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.446
Maybe not in physical form, but--

24:08.282 --> 24:11.201
Lots of people say they feel that, Dorothy.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.120
I'm sure there's truth in it.

24:14.288 --> 24:18.292
And I think that maybe in some...

24:20.961 --> 24:22.713
spectacular moments...

24:25.132 --> 24:26.800
we get to see them again.

24:30.554 --> 24:33.390
I got in a bad wreck when I was 17.

24:34.308 --> 24:37.477
Crashed my parents' car
doing 100 miles an hour on the freeway.

24:39.354 --> 24:42.357
I didn't have a pulse
when the paramedics got there.

24:44.443 --> 24:48.864
And I always felt that maybe we were
brought back because we understood pain.

24:49.990 --> 24:53.660
We're supposed to help good people
dealing with horrible things.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.995
People like you.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.417
You're one of them.

25:01.752 --> 25:04.755
Church of the Lesser Saints,
they saved me.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.298
They helped me join the police force.

25:06.298 --> 25:10.010
And when I was ready, they asked me
to keep an eye on one of our sisters.

25:11.678 --> 25:12.679
Leanne?

25:18.602 --> 25:20.103
They didn't find her body yet.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.648
Maybe the cult covered it up.

25:23.148 --> 25:24.650
Maybe somehow she made it out.

25:26.276 --> 25:27.528
Leanne is gone.

25:29.613 --> 25:31.865
We have the worst fucking luck
in the world.

25:33.617 --> 25:34.618
I don't know.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.580
I think we might be all right.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.544
Let's start over.

25:45.671 --> 25:46.880
I'll call a cab.

25:56.473 --> 25:57.724
You never gave up on me.

25:59.643 --> 26:00.644
Thank you.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.064
You came back to me.

26:06.275 --> 26:07.276
Come on.

26:42.311 --> 26:43.312
Julian!

26:47.107 --> 26:48.358
Can I have a word?

26:48.358 --> 26:50.569
I already answered
all the police's questions.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.780
What is this?

26:54.281 --> 26:55.282
We need to talk.

26:55.782 --> 26:56.825
About what?

26:56.825 --> 26:57.993
It's over.

26:58.619 --> 27:05.083
Christmas last year, your heart stopped.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.963
- What?
- He's not breathing. Do something!

27:09.963 --> 27:12.257
- What?
- CPR! Something!

27:26.188 --> 27:28.190
- What? No.
- Well, you're sober now.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.734
Maybe you're seeing things
a bit more clearly?

27:30.734 --> 27:32.236
You probably feel stronger.

27:33.654 --> 27:37.157
- I think I have to go now.
- When you're given a second chance,

27:37.658 --> 27:39.076
it's for a purpose.

27:39.076 --> 27:40.160
Oh, Jesus.

27:40.661 --> 27:42.204
What are you trying to say to me?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.581
What the fuck are you trying to say?

27:44.581 --> 27:45.666
I think you know.

27:48.168 --> 27:51.505
We'll be here when you're ready to talk.

27:54.842 --> 27:56.009
We're family now.

28:34.131 --> 28:35.465
Holy shit.
