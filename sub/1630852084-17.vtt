06:28.830 --> 06:30.699
- You right, Mr. Brown.

06:30.699 --> 06:33.668
- Cora, you need to be
delivered from that Madea demon.

06:33.668 --> 06:34.936
(crowd laughs)
- That's why

06:34.936 --> 06:36.671
when I retired, I felt
like I lost something.

06:36.671 --> 06:40.742

06:46.448 --> 06:50.185
it will be a great help to
us if you would talk to her.

06:50.185 --> 06:51.920
- You sure about that?

06:51.920 --> 06:53.055

not going to school.

07:14.109 --> 07:15.610
- What?

07:15.610 --> 07:18.613

07:18.613 --> 07:20.015

07:20.015 --> 07:21.416
- She just took it on herself

- Mr. Brown?

07:22.350 --> 07:23.351

- Why can't I just take the bus?

07:34.796 --> 07:36.298
- You know why you
can't take the bus.

07:36.298 --> 07:38.633
- Oh right, Lindor.
- Lindor.

07:38.633 --> 07:41.002
- The boy that's
technically a man.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.237
(crowd laughs)

07:42.237 --> 07:43.572
- Yeah, what the
hell is a Lindor.

07:43.572 --> 07:44.906
- [Phillip] (stammers)
I don't know.

07:44.906 --> 07:45.774
- Come on son, let's
get in the car.

07:45.774 --> 07:46.708
- All right.

07:46.708 --> 07:49.177
- So, Cora?
(doorbell dings)

07:49.177 --> 07:50.345
- Yes?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.546
- Would you talk to her?

07:51.546 --> 07:53.749
- Sure, (stammers)
okay, I will, I will.

07:53.749 --> 07:55.917
- Thank you so much.
- I will.

07:55.917 --> 07:56.718
- Cora.

07:56.718 --> 07:57.719
- [Cora] Yes.

07:57.719 --> 07:59.254
- Come here, let
me pray for you.

07:59.254 --> 08:01.790
- Yes, Mr. Brown, but I'm

08:01.790 --> 08:03.392
- Cora, you need
to be prayed for.

08:03.392 --> 08:06.028
That Madea spirit
in you is strong.

08:06.028 --> 08:06.928
(crowd laughs)

08:06.928 --> 08:08.296
(groans)
- Okay,

08:08.296 --> 08:09.831
I got this now, don't
worry about it, I got this.

08:09.831 --> 08:11.333
- Whew, I don't got this.

08:12.634 --> 08:13.602
(crowd laughs)

08:13.602 --> 08:15.203
- She gon' tear Cora behind up.

08:16.738 --> 08:18.240
- She gon' wear that ass out.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.274
(crowd laughs)
(stammers)

08:19.274 --> 08:20.742
- Stop all that cussin'!

08:20.742 --> 08:21.676
- Ya damn right.

08:21.676 --> 08:22.978
- Would both of y'all stop?

08:24.646 --> 08:25.947
- Knock, knock.

08:25.947 --> 08:30.185
(door slams)
Oo, hey.

08:30.185 --> 08:32.220
- If you say knock and
then, just walk in,

08:32.220 --> 08:34.056
then what's the point?

08:34.056 --> 08:36.158
- Okay, I'm sorry,
sorry about that.

08:36.158 --> 08:37.793
- Yeah, I know.

08:37.793 --> 08:39.561
- Woo, okay.

08:40.996 --> 08:42.464
- What do you want?

08:42.464 --> 08:44.266
- Well, I just wanted to
talk to you, that's all.

08:44.266 --> 08:45.767
- Why?

08:45.767 --> 08:47.369
- Well, your parents asked
me to come talk to you.

08:47.369 --> 08:49.237
So I just came to talk to you.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.439
- That is so lame.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.909
- Well, shouldn't you be
gettin' ready for school?

08:53.909 --> 08:56.211
- No, I don't wanna go.

08:56.211 --> 08:57.913
- Well, you have
to go to school.

08:58.914 --> 08:59.748
- Well, I don't.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.416
- Oh.

09:02.517 --> 09:04.252
(crowd chuckles)
And again, all right.

09:05.554 --> 09:08.356
So tell me, what's
goin' on with you?

09:08.356 --> 09:09.558
- What do you mean?

09:09.558 --> 09:11.226
- Well, last night, you just up

09:11.226 --> 09:13.095
and left and you were grounded.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.564
- Okay look, I'm not
an airplane, all right?

09:15.564 --> 09:16.765
So I can't be grounded.

09:17.733 --> 09:18.734
- Oh.

09:18.734 --> 09:20.936
- I am a free spirit.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.070
- Mm, okay.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.973
- Could you just get
out of here please?

09:26.475 --> 09:28.276
- But I wanna talk to you.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.512
- And I don't wanna talk to you.

09:30.512 --> 09:35.484
- Oh, well, but I'm
a good listener.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.419
- Okay.

09:37.419 --> 09:38.653
Well then, let's just both
sit here and listen to nothing

09:38.653 --> 09:40.322
'cause I don't ever
wanna talk to you.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.494
- Woo, help me Lord, I'm just
trying to get this together.

09:45.494 --> 09:48.463
- So let me talk, okay?

09:48.463 --> 09:49.531
- And I won't listen.

09:51.666 --> 09:52.501
- Sandra.

09:54.169 --> 09:56.905
I know you just didn't
put those headphones on.

09:56.905 --> 09:59.608
(crowd laughs)

09:59.608 --> 10:01.043
You got me mixed up, honey.

10:01.043 --> 10:03.145
You got me bent, as
we used to say, honey.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.248
Don't you know I will
snatch those headphones,

10:06.248 --> 10:07.983
right off your head?

10:07.983 --> 10:09.384
Sandra.

10:09.384 --> 10:12.154
So you just gon'
ignore me like that?

10:12.154 --> 10:13.722
You don't hear me!?

10:13.722 --> 10:14.556
Girl!

10:14.556 --> 10:17.526
Oo.
(crowd laughs)

10:17.526 --> 10:18.927
Help me, father, help me.

10:19.928 --> 10:21.430
Okay, this is what we gon' do.

10:21.430 --> 10:25.801
All right then, all right,
I've got somethin' for you.

10:25.801 --> 10:27.035
(tense, reverberant music)

10:27.035 --> 10:28.370
Snatch it, that's
what I wanna do,

10:28.370 --> 10:30.372
is pound you in yo' head.
(crowd laughs)

10:30.372 --> 10:31.540
(music drowns out voice)

10:31.540 --> 10:32.708
Disrespectful.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.978
Oo, that's why I
gave up teachin'.

10:36.978 --> 10:39.548
(crowd laughs)

10:55.930 --> 10:57.064
- ♪

10:57.164 --> 10:58.833

10:58.933 --> 11:02.203
- [laughing]
- Bam, bam!

11:02.303 --> 11:04.739

11:06.073 --> 11:08.876
- VINNY: [laughing]
- Bam!

11:08.976 --> 11:10.611
If you mesh them together.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.046
- I think we need to forget
that book

11:12.146 --> 11:14.949
and just use that jacket.
- [laughing]

11:15.049 --> 11:16.884
- Y'all don't know fashion.
- VINNY: [laughing]

11:16.984 --> 11:18.085

11:18.185 --> 11:19.754

11:22.857 --> 11:25.326
- Look it--What about this?
- Hey, Cora, how did it go?

11:25.426 --> 11:28.095
- I need a drink.

11:28.195 --> 11:30.865
- Do you drink?
- No, I don't drink.

11:30.965 --> 11:33.568
- Cora, what happened?
- I mean, she was rude as...

11:33.668 --> 11:35.369
- Hell!
- You know I don't say that!

11:35.469 --> 11:38.172
- Well, I said it for you.
- I mean, she was so rude,

11:38.272 --> 11:40.074
I can't even believe
how rude she was!

11:40.174 --> 11:42.276
- I know. I know.
- Maybe you should call Madea,

11:42.376 --> 11:44.845
Madea'll get her straight.
- Now, you're right.

11:44.946 --> 11:46.380
You're right, she would
get her straight.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.716
- Wa--wa--was she, uh--
- Oh, Madea's a heavyweight.

11:48.816 --> 11:50.017
Oh, she can fight.

11:50.117 --> 11:52.653
She--she fought in a brass
knuckle contest one time.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.790
- While topless.
- Won.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.558
- Okay, well,
maybe we should call her.

11:57.658 --> 12:00.094
- Yeah.
- No, we can't call her.

12:00.194 --> 12:01.095
- Why?

12:01.195 --> 12:03.664
- You got insurance
on that girl?

12:03.764 --> 12:04.699
- At this point, Mr. Brown,

12:04.799 --> 12:05.833
somebody gotta
do something, okay?

12:05.933 --> 12:07.268
- You don't wanna do that
unless you got

12:07.368 --> 12:09.203
a good insurance policy,
'cause Madea gon' probably

12:09.303 --> 12:11.205
just choke her out.

12:11.305 --> 12:12.907
- You know what?
You young parents today,

I just dont get it.
- What don't you get?

12:16.143 --> 12:19.547

12:22.383 --> 12:26.120

- Thank you, BS.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.121
- You cussed!

12:27.221 --> 12:30.758
- No, that stands
for Baby Satan.

12:30.858 --> 12:31.893
- I'm gonna talk to her.

12:31.993 --> 12:34.262
- LEAH: Hey--
- Ah--uh-uh, no. No.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.763
- Well, look, now, I can--

- Huh?

12:45.506 --> 12:46.741
- You think I'm not?

12:46.841 --> 12:49.310

today's teenagers?

12:49.410 --> 12:51.312
- I have you to know people

- You gonna make it worse.

12:58.619 --> 12:59.954
- No, no, let him
go on in there,

13:00.087 --> 13:03.324
I can't wait for her to chew
him up and spit his ass out.

13:03.424 --> 13:05.993
- Baby, let him.
It can't hurt, right?

13:06.093 --> 13:09.197

13:11.732 --> 13:14.168

Absolutely, go on.

13:14.268 --> 13:16.370

13:16.470 --> 13:18.005

- You go.

13:18.105 --> 13:19.807

Cora, y'all pray for me, okay?

13:27.114 --> 13:28.416
- Cora.
- CORA: Yes?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.819

you can have all my clothes.

13:31.919 --> 13:33.788
- Okay.
- I'm willing them to you.

13:33.888 --> 13:36.157
- Thanks.
- Don't try to wish me dead

13:36.257 --> 13:39.160
'cause you want my stuff.
- Okay.

13:40.328 --> 13:44.165
- Cora, if I don't make it back,

You gotta learn

14:33.247 --> 14:34.282
Hey.

14:36.851 --> 14:38.286
I said hi.

14:41.188 --> 14:42.990
Look, girl,

14:45.393 --> 14:50.464
Leroy S. Brown, and the S
is for "Sychotic."

14:50.565 --> 14:52.967
Y'all don't wanna mess

14:53.134 --> 14:55.069
- Why are you all messing

14:55.136 --> 14:57.705
- You need to get up

14:57.805 --> 14:59.941
- No, I don't,
'cause I'm not going.

15:00.074 --> 15:02.176

15:02.276 --> 15:04.478

15:06.347 --> 15:08.649
- Okay, look, I don't know you.

15:08.749 --> 15:11.752
- That's good, I don't know you
either, so that's a good thing.

15:11.852 --> 15:13.187
- Why's that?
- That way no one

15:13.287 --> 15:16.090
will suspect me when you
come up missing.

15:16.157 --> 15:18.626
They always suspect
the men around first.

15:19.994 --> 15:23.731
- Who are you?
- What's wrong with you?

15:23.831 --> 15:27.101
- Would you mind your business?
- Okay, lil--look, girl,

You been causing a lot

- Would you please get out?
- Okay look, lil' girl.

15:40.681 --> 15:44.118
I ain't in a mood right now.
You see these green shoes?

15:44.185 --> 15:47.421
They hurt. They look pretty,
but they're hurting my feet

15:47.521 --> 15:51.959
right now.
My bunion is going like this.

15:52.126 --> 15:54.128
"I'm gon' get you, sucker."

15:54.195 --> 15:55.463
- That's disgusting.
- And I'm trying to get

15:55.563 --> 15:58.366
this place open so I can get
my money back out of here.

15:58.466 --> 16:01.402
The longer you sittin' around
here, looking mean

16:01.502 --> 16:04.639
and looking ugly in your spirit
and in your "altitudes..."

16:04.739 --> 16:06.841
- Looking ugly?
- I didn't say "looking ugly,"

16:06.941 --> 16:08.442
I said your altitude was ugly,
don't do it.

16:08.543 --> 16:09.777
- Look in the mirror,
'cause you're not

16:09.877 --> 16:12.113
telling me that I'm ugly.
- You don't try to correct me

16:12.213 --> 16:14.181
while I'm fussing at you.
- I have a mirror.

16:14.282 --> 16:15.616
Do you want me to show you
your face?

16:15.716 --> 16:17.585
- Girl, I didn't say
your face was--I said your--

16:17.685 --> 16:21.756
your altitude was ugly.
Pull it...together!

16:21.856 --> 16:23.124
- Don't you put your
hand in my face.

16:23.224 --> 16:24.825
- Ain't nobody putting
my hand in your face.

16:24.926 --> 16:27.528
- Look,
I said that I don't care.

16:27.628 --> 16:31.566
- Well, why you don't care?
- I don't wanna talk to you.

16:31.666 --> 16:33.668
- You not talking to me?
And you turned your--

16:35.369 --> 16:37.138
I bet you you wanna talk
to that little ol' boy

16:37.238 --> 16:39.006
that drive the bus.

16:39.106 --> 16:43.110
- Say what?
- Oh, "Say--say what?"

16:43.211 --> 16:45.746
- That little boy
is none of your business.

16:45.846 --> 16:49.317
- Okay. Okay, look. Girl, why
you gotta be acting like this?

16:49.417 --> 16:51.719
Don't you know that you can
get much more out of people

16:51.819 --> 16:55.189
when you're nice than you can
walking around here mad!

16:55.289 --> 16:59.927
- Would you leave me alone?!
- Okay, look, girl.

17:00.061 --> 17:03.130
Okay, just...go in there
and tell your parents

17:03.231 --> 17:06.100
that you're sorry,
and I guarantee you,

17:06.200 --> 17:07.134
things will get better.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.570
- Look, I don't wanna be here.

17:09.670 --> 17:12.907
- Have you looked around here?
Look, just look around!

17:13.074 --> 17:15.176
Look at all the fun stuff
around here!

17:15.276 --> 17:18.346
Look. Look at that lamp.
Look. Look how it's glistening

17:18.446 --> 17:23.284
up in the air; it's so much
fun, watch, look at this.

17:23.384 --> 17:28.890
Look at that. A spinning top,
you see? That's fun!

17:28.990 --> 17:32.526
- That's a hair brush.
- There's fun stuff everywhere!

17:32.627 --> 17:36.097
Look at the fun stuff
around here!

17:36.197 --> 17:38.266
- Okay, look, the only thing
that's fun here

17:38.366 --> 17:39.600
is hanging out with Lindor,

17:39.700 --> 17:41.602
and they don't even want me
to do that.

17:41.702 --> 17:45.373
- You want me to tell you why?
'Cause it's your altitude.

17:45.473 --> 17:46.674
- It's attitude. Attitude.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.310
- Whatever it is.
- A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E. Attitude.

17:49.410 --> 17:50.912
- You ain't the only one
can spell too.

17:51.012 --> 17:53.214
- Spell it. Spell it.
Spell "Attitude,"

17:53.314 --> 17:55.049
'cause I litereally just
spelled it, so.

17:55.149 --> 17:57.351
- A-T-T--your 'tude is bad.

17:59.086 --> 18:00.421
- That's what I thought.

18:00.521 --> 18:02.056
- But if you went
and told your parents

18:02.156 --> 18:03.891
that you're sorry,
I'm telling you,

18:04.058 --> 18:06.360
things would get better for you,
you can turn this around.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.596
- No, I don't think
that'll work.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.631
- Listen, I'm trying to tell you
how to get

18:10.731 --> 18:14.902
to your little boyfriend,
who's technically "a man."

18:15.069 --> 18:18.639
- Okay, I'm listening.
- When you're nice, like me--

18:18.739 --> 18:19.874
look.

18:23.277 --> 18:26.113
When you're nice,
you can get what you want.

18:26.214 --> 18:28.482
So go down there and tell
your mom and daddy,

18:28.583 --> 18:30.785
"Look, mom and daddy--"
- No.

18:30.885 --> 18:34.622
- Do, like, the, "I'm sorry."
- I don't sound like that.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.324
- But you gotta do it
like this, and that way

18:36.424 --> 18:37.892
they'll know you're really
sorry.

18:39.694 --> 18:42.163
Say it, "I'm sorry."
- "I'm sorry."

18:42.263 --> 18:43.731
- Like that.
- I--

18:43.831 --> 18:46.100
- No-uh!

18:46.167 --> 18:49.570
- "I'm sorry."
- And then, in a couple days,

18:49.670 --> 18:51.739
ask 'em can Lindor
come over, ain't that his name?

18:51.839 --> 18:56.811
Lin--Lind--Lindor? Lindor.

18:56.911 --> 18:59.046
- You know that's his name.
- I don't know his name!

18:59.146 --> 19:00.681
I don't know him!

19:00.781 --> 19:03.317
- If you don't know his name,
then how come you just said it?

19:04.352 --> 19:05.653
- I'm psychic.

19:05.753 --> 19:09.123
I just told you that,
I'm psychotic.

19:09.223 --> 19:11.459
- My parents are just--
they're so...

19:11.559 --> 19:13.694
- Okay, look, your parents know
what you've been through,

19:13.794 --> 19:17.698
but you got to try
something different: nice.
