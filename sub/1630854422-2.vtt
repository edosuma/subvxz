01:10.195 --> 01:11.571
Get down!

09:53.551 --> 09:56.095
Bless them with eternal rest, O Lord.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.389
Shine on them your perpetual light.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.683
And may they rest in peace.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.535
Are you alone?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.568
Poor thing.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.717
Are you okay?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.386
Yes…
I think I might need stitches.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.889
-I'll take her.
-Sorry, Hans. Can you cover my shift?

13:26.972 --> 13:28.015
Yeah, no problem. Go.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.183
Yeah. Thanks.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.137
-Good evening, Father.
-May the Apostle bless you.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.222
Hello.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.684
Did you come for the Apostle's Festival?

18:22.768 --> 18:26.772
We're part of the congregation
of St. Francis Church on Calle Bailén.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.315
Yes. I know it well.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.610
Do you believe in miracles?

18:32.528 --> 18:33.862
-Yes.
-Hmm.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.947
That's good.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.616
Because they're everywhere.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.410
Now that he's among us.

18:40.911 --> 18:41.870
"He"?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.540
The angel, Adriel.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.585
His arrival foretells a new world.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.268
Do not be afraid.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.898
I said, do not be afraid!

19:22.077 --> 19:23.704
What's going on?

19:23.787 --> 19:25.247
With the power of faith,

19:26.874 --> 19:29.209
no danger may stand before you.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.554
So my will be done.

29:42.071 --> 29:46.743
But why be divided,
when we can be so much stronger together?
