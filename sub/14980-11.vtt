He’s gonna answer
our questions.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.782
What is wrong
with you people?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.419
He’s fully cooperated.
You know he’s not well.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.794
He ’5 in his third round
of chemo, for God’s sake.

14:02.884 --> 14:06.376
Those people outside
might get their wish
sooner than they think.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.759
Did you ever stop to think
maybe there’s a reason
they hate you so much?

14:11.476 --> 14:14.263
I was carrying losses forward, son,

14:14.354 --> 14:19.565
and / had eve/y intention
ofpaying the money back
in a couple of good quarters.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.184
I’m not stealing anything.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.488
- You mean you weren’t
stealing anything.
- That’s what I said.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.283
Did you hear him
change verb tenses...

14:34.374 --> 14:37.286
every time he talked about
whether there was any money left?

14:37.377 --> 14:40.289
He kept shifting from
the past to the present
and back again.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.793
But that doesn’t change the fact
that he’s gonna go to a country
club prison for five years...

14:43.884 --> 14:46.296
and he’s never gonna
give up the money.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.298
Mr. Hollin is dying.
He’s not gonna make it two years
in the prison health system.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.801
Maybe he’s protecting
his daughter’s inheritance.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.804
Okay, but he’s
still not gonna tell us
where the money is.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.307
If he’s saving the money
for his daughter,

14:57.397 --> 15:00.810
then she must know something
about how to access it.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.608
Okay, so we get back in
with the devil’s spawn...

15:03.695 --> 15:05.606
and we see
what she knows.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.939
“The devil’s spawn”?
What is with you on this one?

15:09.034 --> 15:11.776
This pompous douche bag
flies around the country
on his privatejet,

15:11.870 --> 15:15.283
he gets people to give him
their hard-earned money— steals it—

15:15.373 --> 15:18.501
and then they act like
we are persecuting him.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.668
- I’m talking to the daughter alone.
- What? Why?

15:21.755 --> 15:26.169
Ifshe keeps sensing
how much you hate her father,
we’ll get nothing.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.631
So, where are we on video?

15:33.725 --> 15:36.137
We’ve got Rajal on video
on the subway platform,

15:36.228 --> 15:39.971
but it’s being held from us
by a US. attorney who’s got
some issue with us— well, you.

15:40.065 --> 15:43.182
Just do yourjob.
Get it.]ust get it.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.814
Where you been?

15:46.947 --> 15:50.405
Can I talk to you
for a minute?
/’m a little busy right now

15:50.492 --> 15:54.701
Could have used you
a couple hours ago.
I called you I think twice.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.653
Just a minute.
Please?

15:56.748 --> 15:58.488
W-What do you want?

16:00.961 --> 16:03.873
I’m on my way to meet
with Carolyn Hollin.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.252
Ijust wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

16:07.342 --> 16:12.553
-|’m fantastic.
-’Cause I can put Hollin on hold
till things quiet down here.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.677
- You didn’t make it to
your meeting with the mayor.
- I canceled it.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.104
No, actually, you didn’t,
and it’s been on the books
for three weeks.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.773
- But I meant to cancel it.
- Cal.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.398
Go mother someone else.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.149
Everyone back to work,
please.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.702
[All Chattering]

16:39.749 --> 16:41.614
Hey.
How’s it going in there?

16:41.751 --> 16:45.664
Ah, this whole thing’s
a little weird, ifyou ask me.
What about it?

16:45.755 --> 16:49.247
Oh, I don’t know.
Investigating suicides
in the first place.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.378
Yeah.
Lightman’s thing.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.381
Yeah. Yesterday he was
watching some old video
ofa British woman...

16:54.472 --> 16:56.554
when I walked into his office.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.180
I want the weekend
to go home to my children.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.188
It’s my husband’s birthday
and, well, we always celebrate.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.144
[Eli]
Brown hair.7About 40?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.150
Yeah.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.153
Lightman probably spent
about a thousand hours
watching that film.

17:16.244 --> 17:21.034
Oh, I’ll bake a chocolate cake,
just like I do every year.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.785
Her name is Louise Mason.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.039
She was a patient
ofone of Lightman’s professors
when he was in grad school.

17:26.129 --> 17:29.587
She had been
in the psych ward about a month
when that was recorded

17:29.674 --> 17:32.006
She told the professor
she was ﬁne.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.004
And you’ve been
feeling better?

17:34.095 --> 17:35.710
Every day.

17:35.805 --> 17:39.047
- Much better.
- But no one could see
she was actually in agony.

17:39.142 --> 17:44.182
tightman finally got the idea to
slow down the ﬁlm. That’s when
he saw the agony on her face.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.350
That’s what led him
to discover microexpressions
in the first place.

17:49.444 --> 17:53.187
Well, I— I hope they didn’t let
that woman offthe psych ward.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.944
She got a pass home
for the weekend
and killed herself.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.994
They didn ’t know to look
for microexpressions then.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.122
Nobody knew they existed

18:16.721 --> 18:20.589
It’s sad how my father
has become the scapegoat
for this country’s problems.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.512
He didn’t cause
the recession.
No, he didn’t.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.685
He’s one man
who made a mistake.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.935
Now it’s gonna haunt
our family forever.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.897
You worked
right by his side.

18:32.988 --> 18:36.355
I’m sure you’re upset
he lied to you too.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.657
/ know what it’s like
to be disappointed b ya father.

18:39.744 --> 18:43.282
Mine drank his way through
my childhood and spent his life
trying to make it up to me.

18:43.373 --> 18:47.241
Don’t try to analyze me
or my father. You don’t know
anything about us.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.748
He’s still hiding
some ofthe money for you
and your children, isn’t he?

18:50.839 --> 18:52.670
Of course not.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.873
You’re telling the truth.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.299
- So what is he hiding?
- Nothing.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.176
But no one
will believe him.

19:02.267 --> 19:06.601
They want to crucify him.
They call him
the Hit/er of Wall Street.

19:08.398 --> 19:12.311
[Carolyn] Nothing good can
ever happen to our family now.
It’s been a horror.

19:12.402 --> 19:15.519
Carolyn used
negative emotion words
every time she spoke.

19:15.613 --> 19:19.276
“Hell. Scapegoat. Haunt.
Hitler. Worthless. Crucify.”

19:19.367 --> 19:22.279
All psychological indicators
ofa guilty conscience.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.409
But she showed no signs of lying
when she said her father wasn’t
hiding the money for them.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.161
No, she didn’t.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.880
What if she’s
hiding the money?

19:32.964 --> 19:36.832
The SEC. cleared her,
but only because
her father took the blame.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.212
Maybe he’s taking the blame
for everything...

19:39.304 --> 19:42.216
to hide whatever part
his daughter had in this scheme.

19:42.307 --> 19:46.846
If his daughter was guilty,
a man like Hollin wouldn’t
hesitate to eat his young.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.303
Look at a man like
he’s the devil and you’ll
never understand his motives.

19:50.398 --> 19:53.014
Well, everyone knows
he’s a liar.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.441
Then we listen to him lie.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.817
Here are the articles
for Carolyn Hollin
and herfather.

19:59.908 --> 20:03.492
Thanks. Now get back
to helping Lightman.
Whatever he needs.

20:07.457 --> 20:11.416
Uh, this suicide thing?

20:11.503 --> 20:12.868
What about it?

20:12.962 --> 20:15.874
I saw him watching
the film ofthat woman,
Louise Mason,

20:15.965 --> 20:19.002
and Lokertold me
how she was a patient
of Lightman’s professor.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.631
-Yeah?
- I saw him looking at her.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.632
He showed guilt all over his face.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.307
Just because you can see
everything doesn’t mean
you understand it.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.348
I don’t think she was
his professor’s patient.

20:31.439 --> 20:34.226
I think she was his patient.

20:34.317 --> 20:37.775
What if he’s the one
who didn’t see it
and let her offthe psych ward?

20:37.862 --> 20:39.978
Leave it alone.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.700
Hey. You okay?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.452
Yeah, I’m good.

20:51.543 --> 20:55.081
Ijust figured you’d be
working late, so I brought
your favorite Pad Thai.

20:55.171 --> 20:59.130
- Nice.
- You know, I thought you
were gonna come home.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.583
Got a lot ofwork
here, love.

21:01.678 --> 21:05.136
You really should try
opening up to me.

21:05.223 --> 21:08.386
- What is that? Oprah?
- Ehh, it might be.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.976
So, are these the two girls
thatjumped off the bridge?
Yeah.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.770
Hey, do you remember,

21:14.858 --> 21:18.100
uh, that girl at my school who,
she took all those pills...

21:18.194 --> 21:19.775
and killed herself?

21:19.863 --> 21:22.400
I-I didn’t really
know her very well,

21:22.490 --> 21:25.106
but she was in my art class...

21:25.201 --> 21:29.695
and she used to paint
these really colorful oil paintings.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.201
Like, just, you know,
shapes, really.

21:33.668 --> 21:37.707
I wonder sometimes ifanyone
could have stopped her.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.214
What?

21:46.306 --> 21:47.967
Nothing.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.805
[ Kisses]

21:57.650 --> 22:00.141
You shouldn’t think
about that stuff, love.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.522
What am I supposed to
think about?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.488
Celibacy.
[Scoffs]

22:07.911 --> 22:11.369
[Grunts]
Food. Here. Eat it.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.619
I love you, Em.

22:58.336 --> 23:01.248
Only reason I’m here is because
Zoe asked me to help you.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.546
She’s a lot more forgiving
than I would ever be.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.544
Yeah? Well, she’s
the mother of my daughter.

23:05.635 --> 23:08.502
We’ve all got things to
forgive, haven’t we, love?
What have we got?

23:08.596 --> 23:11.383
Your third suicide victim,
Rajal Lamba.

23:11.474 --> 23:16.013
This is what you saw on the
videotape. It’s a ring ofskin
pigmentation called melasma.

23:17.355 --> 23:20.518
It’s the mask of pregnancy,
right?
Exactly.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.099
It’s a common
hormonal side effect.

23:23.194 --> 23:26.186
The autopsy revealed
that she gave birth
approximately a month ago.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.611
What about
the Ashrafsisters?

23:30.702 --> 23:32.408
We finished autopsies
on both ofthem.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.907
Each gave birth
in the last two months.

23:34.998 --> 23:39.662
All three ofthem?
Why would they all give birth
and then kill themselves?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.245
And where are
all the babies?

23:49.679 --> 23:53.342
The victims had
all the risk factors
for postpartum depression.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.345
Twenty-five percent
of low-income women
suffer from it.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.677
Okay. You got three
Indian women, right?

23:58.771 --> 24:02.480
All around the same age,
they all have babies,
and they all kill themselves.

24:02.567 --> 24:06.105
I mean, postpartum
doesn’t explain it.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.811
They had no support here.
No family, no friends.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.818
There has to be some link
between these girls.

24:11.909 --> 24:16.243
There has to be some reason
why they killed themselves.

24:20.209 --> 24:24.828
I know you don’t want to
hearthis again, but I’m
gonna say it to you anyway.

24:24.922 --> 24:29.712
It doesn’t matter how many
you find a reason for.
It wasn’t your fault.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.673
Hey.

24:32.764 --> 24:35.221
We found Medicaid bills
for Rajal Lamba,
the third suicide.

24:35.308 --> 24:39.301
She was discharged
from the obstetrics ward
at a hospital in Virginia.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.263
Loker wanted me to tell you
that he got you back in
withJoseph Hollin.

24:43.358 --> 24:44.939
Thanks.

24:45.026 --> 24:47.733
[Barking]

24:49.155 --> 24:52.318
My daughter
had nothing to do with this.
I betrayed her.

24:52.408 --> 24:55.946
- You don’t believe that.
- Well, it happens to be true.

24:56.037 --> 25:00.030
Your daughter’s filled with
pent-up guilt about something,
and it’s not about the money.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.207
I think she feels guilty
because she’s letting you
take the blame.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.205
I’m calling my lawyer.

25:05.296 --> 25:09.084
Before you call your la wyer,
you should know that unless
you tell us the truth...

25:09.175 --> 25:11.837
we’re going to the SEC.
to tell them that
we think she’s involved.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.840
I stole the money.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.637
That’s not true.

25:16.724 --> 25:19.807
You didn’t steal it.
/t was her.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.806
She stood there acting
like we were persecuting
your family.

25:22.897 --> 25:25.730
I mean, what is she?
Some sort of sociopath
with no conscience?

25:27.402 --> 25:30.269
Loker, give us a minute.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.993
Mr. Hollin—

25:43.084 --> 25:47.327
Imagine your husband
or your sister
made a mistake...

25:49.549 --> 25:52.507
and you knew you could
make a small sacrifice
to protect them.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.005
The worst lies we tell
are out of love.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.593
But I’d want my family
to learn from their mistakes.

26:04.147 --> 26:08.561
I’ll get her to give you
the names and accounts of shell
companies holding the money,

26:08.651 --> 26:11.358
but only if
you’ll make me a guarantee.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.823
You’re gonna
let him go to prison
for his daughter?

26:20.913 --> 26:23.655
We’re gonna get these people
their pensions back,
their livelihoods.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.206
That’s what matters.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.284
What does that say
to all ofthe Bernie Madoffs...

26:27.378 --> 26:30.290
and all ofthe Carolyn Hollins
waiting in the wings?

26:30.381 --> 26:32.838
You think the victims
should just lose everything?

26:32.925 --> 26:36.167
You have to put these people away,
or they will keep
coming back like a cancer.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.004
You cannot let them think
they can do this
and not get punished.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.635
When you’re the boss,
make whatever call you want.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.850
Hey.
Ah.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.197
Rajal Lamba was discharged
four weeks ago,

26:55.281 --> 26:57.897
but the baby’s still here
for an ongoing lung condition.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.983
Miss Dale?
This way.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.322
Which one is he?

27:06.417 --> 27:09.830
He’s almost fully recovered.
He’ll probably be discharged
in the next few days.

27:09.921 --> 27:12.162
There must be some mistake.
This baby’s white.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.372
So is
his biological mother.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.226
Is there something wrong?

27:27.313 --> 27:29.520
Is this your baby?

27:29.607 --> 27:31.347
Yes.
Robert’s my son.

27:31.442 --> 27:34.775
Ma’am, I’m from
the US. Attorney’s office,

27:34.862 --> 27:40.073
and we’re investigating
the death ofa woman
named Rajal Lamba.

27:42.411 --> 27:44.823
Rajal’s dead?
Yeah.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.119
How did you know her?

27:49.210 --> 27:51.121
She was my surrogate.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.459
She carried Robert
to term for me.

27:55.550 --> 27:57.211
She was a surrogate?

27:58.511 --> 28:01.469
- What happened to her?
- Well, she killed herself.

28:01.556 --> 28:04.343
- Oh, my God!
- How did you find her?

28:04.433 --> 28:07.300
How did you...
become connected?

28:07.395 --> 28:09.306
Through
this on/ine registiy.

28:09.397 --> 28:12.605
Surrogacy is very expensive—
60 or 70 thousand dollars.

28:12.692 --> 28:16.856
This registry
was able to do it for us
for less than $10,000.

28:16.946 --> 28:19.733
Do you know
where Rajal was living?

28:28.249 --> 28:30.160
What ifall three women
were surrogates?

28:30.251 --> 28:32.913
It would explain
why we haven’t located
any oftheir babies.

was co vering for her.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.602

How did you discover this?

29:36.692 --> 29:39.229
I really can’t
discuss the details

29:39.320 --> 29:41.561
Well, have you spoken
to Mr. Hollin
about the money?

29:41.697 --> 29:44.484
Is he cooperating?

the details.

29:44.575 --> 29:48.193

30:14.021 --> 30:15.932

You said you’d keep
my daughter out ofthis.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.395
I wasn’t the one

30:20.486 --> 30:23.148
I was gonna make her turn over

30:23.239 --> 30:26.072
She was gonna leave the business
and take care of her children.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.070
We had nothing to do
with the SEC. finding out.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.743

That’sJaya

31:05.239 --> 31:08.106
Why don’t you try and tell us
about them, all right?

31:09.452 --> 31:11.693
They had their babies
just as I arrived.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.779
That was the last time
you saw the sisters?

31:16.292 --> 31:18.203
After their babies,

31:18.294 --> 31:22.458
they were thrown out
onto the streets
like slum trash.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.839
We were promised $5,000,

31:25.926 --> 31:28.338

for rent and food..

there’s nothing left.

What was his name?

31:34.060 --> 31:36.301
He will come after me.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.602
He can’t hurt you anymore.

31:43.027 --> 31:45.985
He found me when I went
to renew my visa.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.779
He works at Immigration.

32:00.419 --> 32:04.082
These are notarized surrogacy
agreements for all the women
who were found in the apartment.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.630
He set up consenting adults
with licensed physicians.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.582
Those women
are all illegal aliens.

32:08.677 --> 32:11.419
But they weren’t
when my client entered into
these surrogacy agreements.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.802
They were all on visas
when he approached them
about his Side business.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.760
Why is your client
so afraid to speak?

32:18.854 --> 32:22.563
Ifyou want to charge me
with hiring aliens
after visas expired, go ahead.

32:22.650 --> 32:25.107
How about with murder?

32:25.194 --> 32:27.480
The Ashraf sisters
jumped offa bridge...

32:27.571 --> 32:30.529
and Rajal threw herself
in front ofa train.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.699
You created a world
for these women where suicide
seemed like the only option.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.698
We can charge you
with depra ved heart murder—

32:36.789 --> 32:40.281
callous disregard for human life
that results in death.

32:40.417 --> 32:44.751
This is what you have?
Depraved heart charges are for people
who shoot a gun into a crowd.

32:44.839 --> 32:48.457
There’s nojury in the state
that will convict him,
and you know it.

32:51.220 --> 32:54.428
You exploited these women,
and then you threatened them.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.631
Then you threw them out
into the street.

they were done working for me...

they’d kill themselves?

to operating a business

33:11.866 --> 33:14.232

accusations are ridiculous.

to file your paperwork
before we walk out of here.

33:18.122 --> 33:19.953

Nice to see you too.
Follow me. Let’s go.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.957
I was hoping the threat was
gonna get something out of him,

33:28.048 --> 33:30.460
but we can’t actually charge him
with depraved heart.

33:30.551 --> 33:32.917
We’d have to be able to prove
he knew those women
were gonna commit suicide.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.798
He knew.

33:34.889 --> 33:37.130
When you asked how he could’ve
known those women were gonna
jump, his eyebrows went up.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.055
How could I know
they’d kill themselves?

33:39.185 --> 33:42.552
Eyebrows up means you know
the answer to your own question.
His eyebrows went up?

33:42.646 --> 33:44.853
Did he also click his heels
three times?

33:44.940 --> 33:47.602
That’s not evidence.
We need evidence.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.184
I’m telling you,
he knew those girls
were gonnajump.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.894
We have no proof.

33:51.989 --> 33:55.356
Even ifwe could show
he mistreated those women
and we got them to testify,

33:55.451 --> 33:57.567
all we could charge him with
is negligence.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.368

his statement, and then
we have to let him go.

He got a pay phone call a block
from the subway five minutes
before Ms. Lambajumped.

34:09.548 --> 34:12.665
She called him.
There is no proof
it was Ms. Lamba.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.843
She called him. She told him
what she was gonna do,
and he did nothing.

34:15.930 --> 34:17.636
The definition of circumstantial.

34:19.308 --> 34:23.597

the right question
under the right circumstances.

34:23.687 --> 34:25.393
What circumstances?

34:25.481 --> 34:28.188
We need to confront him
with her family.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.688

35:15.906 --> 35:17.737
Nobody else knew, Loker.

35:17.825 --> 35:19.986
They must’ve found out
on their own.

onto this for months.

and ask them.

how he got his information.
