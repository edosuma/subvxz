I'M REALLY GOOD,

09:16.597 --> 09:19.308
AND HE ADMIRES MY COMMITMENT.
- SO THAT SNEAKY LITTLE RAT

09:19.392 --> 09:21.477
THINKS THAT HE CAN
DIVIDE AND CONQUER,

09:21.560 --> 09:23.854
AND BY THE WAY,
I HAVE THONG THAT CAN DO THAT,

09:23.938 --> 09:26.315
IN CASE WE WANT TO GO
WITH THE LINGERIE ROUTE.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.317
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HIM?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.486
- WELL, I TURNED HIM DOWN,
OF COURSE.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.114
OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN'T WIN
WITHOUT ME.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.782
I'M ONLY MENTIONING IT

09:34.865 --> 09:36.367
SO YOU'LL START TAKING
THE CONTEST SERIOUSLY.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.869
- WHO SAYS WE CAN'T WIN
WITHOUT YOU?

09:38.953 --> 09:42.540
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S A LITTLE COCKY.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.166
- WELL, LET'S BE HONEST, YOU
HAVE YOUR <i> WOMAN'S DAY</i> COLUMN,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.127
AND THEY HAVE
THEIR OUTFIT IDEAS.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.337
I'M THE ONLY ONE SHOWING
ANY REAL PASSION FOR THE MUSIC.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.967
- DIVA SPEAK FOR "I'M GREAT
AND THE REST OF YOU SUCK."

09:53.050 --> 09:54.844
- NO, IT ISN'T.
- OH, PLEASE.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.304
I'VE BEEN SPEAKING DIVA

09:56.387 --> 09:58.681
SINCE I TEARFULLY INFORMED
MY PRESCHOOL TEACHER

09:58.764 --> 10:02.977
THAT NOT ALL THE LITTLE TEAPOTS
ARE SHORT AND STOUT.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.146
- IF YOU'RE JUST STAYING
WITH US OUT OF GUILT, FORGET IT.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.856
GO AHEAD AND BE A WEASEL.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.192
- YOU'LL BE HAPPIER
AMONG YOUR OWN KIND.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.445
- I DIDN'T SAY
I WANTED TO BE A WEASEL.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.863
THERE'S NO REASON
TO GET SNARKY.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.867
- NO ONE'S GETTING SNARKY.
- I WAS.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.786
- LOOK, IF YOU WANT OUT,
WE DON'T WANT TO HOLD YOU BACK.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.039
- OR PUT UP WITH
YOUR PATRONIZING ATTITUDE

10:23.122 --> 10:25.249
THAT IS STIFLING OUR CREATIVITY
AND, QUITE FRANKLY,

10:25.333 --> 10:29.545
TAKING ALL OF THE FUN
OUT OF THIS WHOLE DAMN THING.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.547
OR, YOU KNOW,
THAT NICER THING

10:31.630 --> 10:34.050
THAT MELANIE JUST SAID.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.803
- WELL, IF I'M RUINING YOUR FUN,
MAYBE I SHOULD BE A WEASEL.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.973
- DON'T LET THE DOOR
HIT YOUR TAIL ON THE WAY OUT.

10:43.142 --> 10:47.021
- FINE.
MAY THE BEST BAND WIN.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.899
- OH, DON'T WORRY, WE WILL.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.777
HMPH! SOME DIVA SHE IS.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.029
SHE DIDN'T EVEN
SLAM THE DOOR.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.699
WELL, WHO NEEDS HER?
- RIGHT, WHO NEEDS HER?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.910
- THINKING SHE'S ALL HOOTIE,

11:00.993 --> 11:05.039
AND WE'RE JUST THE BLOWFISH.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.917
- WELL, TECHNICALLY,
SHE'S THE LEAD SINGER,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.753
SO SHE WOULD BE HOOTIE,
AND WITHOUT HER,

11:10.836 --> 11:13.047
WE DO KIND OF BLOW.

11:13.130 --> 11:16.258
- WE DO NOT. NOW COME ON, WE'RE
GONNA BE GREAT WITHOUT HER.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.803
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.805
I MAY NOT
HAVE JOY'S VIBRATO,

11:20.888 --> 11:23.099
BUT I-I THINK
I CAN IMITATE HER PHRASING.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.558
- W-W-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.602
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE LEAD SINGER?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.938
- WELL, YEAH,

11:29.021 --> 11:30.481
'CAUSE THE NEXT-BEST
SINGER SHOULD STEP UP.

11:30.564 --> 11:33.442
- YES, WHICH IS WHY
I AM STEPPING.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.487
- YOU MEAN TRIPPING.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.323
LEAD SINGER OUT,
DRUMMER MOVES UP.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.950
- LOOK, LOOK,

11:41.033 --> 11:44.286
I HAVE SLEPT
WITH A LOT OF ROCK STARS.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.289
- UNLESS TALENT CAN BE
PASSED ALONG LIKE HEP C,

11:47.373 --> 11:49.500
WHO CARES?

11:49.583 --> 11:52.294
- ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT I HAVE

11:52.378 --> 11:54.296
THE MOST
LEAD SINGER EXPERIENCE.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.006
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU AND ROCK STARS?

11:56.090 --> 11:58.926
- I KNOW. IF MY PRIVATE PARTS
COULD TALK, HUH?

11:59.009 --> 12:02.304

BURY YOU.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.348

15:32.431 --> 15:35.684
- UH-HUH.
- THIS IS SO HOT.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.228
AND IT'S AGAINST
EVERY INSTINCT IN MY BODY

15:38.312 --> 15:40.856
TO STOP A GIRL FIGHT THAT
MIGHT RESULT IN TORN CLOTHES

15:40.939 --> 15:44.276
OR A GLIMPSE
OF SIDE BOOBAGE...

15:44.360 --> 15:47.321
BUT I HAVE A BOOM
THAT MUST BE LOWERED.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.199

15:55.996 --> 15:58.165

15:58.248 --> 16:00.542

16:00.626 --> 16:05.172
WE'RE NOTHING
BUT FANTASTIC DRUMMING.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.882
- WITHOUT THOSE THINGS,
WE CAN NEVER WIN.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.218
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST QUIT.
- NO, NO, WE CAN'T.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.428
MY ENTIRE COLUMN
IS ABOUT DOING THIS.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.348

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND

GOOD NIGHT, LADIES.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.091
Joy: OH, GOOD LORD! HOW DID
YOU EVEN GET UP THAT TREE?

19:36.174 --> 19:39.094
[tree branch snapping]
Rick: OH, NO. OH!

19:39.177 --> 19:41.221
[loud crash]
