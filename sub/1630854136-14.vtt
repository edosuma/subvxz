00:09.444 --> 00:11.489
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:12.838
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.838 --> 00:15.319
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:15.319 --> 00:17.104
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:17.104 --> 00:20.063
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:20.063 --> 00:23.458
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:23.458 --> 00:26.722
Uh-huh!
Red Indie, you with me tonight?

00:28.680 --> 00:29.855
Let's do it!

00:29.855 --> 00:33.076
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Uh-huh!

00:42.259 --> 00:44.044
Thank you, queen.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.480
Look, I keep telling you,

00:45.480 --> 00:47.656
you don't need to have
a good voice.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.179
That's old-fashioned.

00:49.179 --> 00:52.791
It's all about your look,
your attitude.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.967
- If you say so.
- I do.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.882
But if it's terrible--

00:56.882 --> 00:58.232
It'll be great.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.494
I'll make sure.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.496
- Hmm.
- Come here.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.413
Damn, you're beautiful.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.896
Oh, my God!

01:10.896 --> 01:12.376
Dude! Yo, there's shooting!

01:20.123 --> 01:23.170
Go, go, go, go!

01:23.170 --> 01:24.867
Hey, hey.
There's a guy with the gun.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.216
You gotta go. You gotta go!

01:26.216 --> 01:28.914
Hey! Yo. Yo!

01:28.914 --> 01:30.177
Hey!

01:30.177 --> 01:31.917
There's a guy with a gun.
You gotta go!

01:31.917 --> 01:33.093
You got--

01:39.882 --> 01:40.926
What do we got?

01:40.926 --> 01:43.146
One dead, two injured.

01:43.146 --> 01:44.974
- They gonna make it?
- Hopefully.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.236
Somebody had
to see something.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.282
- Guess again.
- Really?

01:48.282 --> 01:50.849
So far, all we know is,
the shooter was male,

01:50.849 --> 01:53.809
masked up,
and wearing a winter coat.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.162
Name is Hannah Gray.

01:59.162 --> 02:02.122
Looks like she tried
to crawl toward the exit.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.775
So young.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.864
Word is,
she was a famous model.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.870
Not the photoshoot
she was hoping for.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.788
So why don't you tell me
about what happened today?

02:16.788 --> 02:18.355
Like, where were you?

02:18.355 --> 02:21.793
Man, I was in the kitchen,
working, unloading boxes.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.621
Yeah.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.275
I heard the gunshots,
then hit the deck.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.147
You were with the woman
who got shot, yeah?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.149
Okay. So how did that happen?
You guys know each other?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.628
You friends?
- Nah.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.152
She was just trying
to run out the back door,

02:32.152 --> 02:37.157
but she saw that I was working
and listening to music.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.985
So she pushed me,
told me to run.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.814
I'd be dead right now
if it wasn't for that woman.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.556
Thank you.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.079
I need to speak
to the man who's in charge!

02:47.079 --> 02:48.516
He's busy,
so please back up--

02:48.516 --> 02:49.952
My daughter was in that club.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.693
- I understand--
- I need to see if she's okay.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.477
I understand,
but I'm trying to do my job,

02:53.477 --> 02:56.306
and I need--just listen--hey!
- Sir, sir, sir. Hey.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.829
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Calm down.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.266
That guy was trying
to penetrate the perimeter.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.397
I understand, Officer,

03:00.397 --> 03:02.007
but he said his daughter
was in the club.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.531
So just back off, please.

03:03.531 --> 03:06.011
Thank you, Officer.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.491
Sir, I'm Detective Jalen Shaw.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.971
This is Detective Cosgrove.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.886
We'd like to help you,
but you need to calm down.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.279
My daughter's friend
just called,

03:12.279 --> 03:14.194
said she heard my daughter
had been shot.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.760
Her name is Hannah Gray.

04:07.986 --> 04:10.467
Doesn't make sense.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.731
She just went out
to have a good time.

04:13.731 --> 04:16.038
What the hell
is this world coming to?

04:16.038 --> 04:19.476
From what I understand,
she saved a young man's life.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.522
It may not mean much
to you right now,

04:21.522 --> 04:24.873
but your daughter Hannah,
she died a hero.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.268
Sir, did your daughter
ever mention anybody

04:28.268 --> 04:29.878
she was having a problem with?

04:29.878 --> 04:33.316
Anybody who might have been
harassing her or stalking her?

04:33.316 --> 04:34.926
Not that I'm aware of.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.277
I mean, she kept
her personal life private.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.931
That's how she was.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.890
We're very sorry
for your loss.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.328
If there's anything else
you can think of,

04:45.328 --> 04:47.112
please give us a call.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.558
I was close by.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.603
I was driving back
to the house.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.953
Heard the call,
so I rode to the scene.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.868
It was crazy,
people running like hell,

05:03.868 --> 05:06.175
so it's been tough
to track down witnesses.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.395
And when you got here,
the shooter had already fled?

05:08.395 --> 05:10.310
I think so.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.615
I didn't hear any gunshots.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.356
Then again, it was loud.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.836
People were yelling
and screaming.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.446
You didn't find
any witnesses?

05:16.446 --> 05:19.362
Talked to a lot of people.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.972
No one got a good look
at the guy.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.060
Do me a favor.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.671
Track down the manager
of the club.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.369
I'm sure he's still here,
all right?

05:26.369 --> 05:28.328
These are the two women
who were injured.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.851
They look familiar to you?

05:29.851 --> 05:32.375
No. Sorry, man.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.986
And this is the woman
who was killed.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.379
Hannah?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.381
Oh, no. That ain't right, man.

05:38.381 --> 05:42.516
Hannah is--was real cool.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.431
I mean, she was just
a good person, you know?

05:44.431 --> 05:46.389
Sounds like
you knew her pretty well.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.477
Yeah.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.826
Yeah, she used to
come here a lot.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.480
Anything unusual
happen tonight?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.134
Was she involved
in any kind of, uh,

05:52.134 --> 05:53.614
altercation or argument?

05:55.529 --> 05:57.705
As a matter of fact, yeah.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.447
Yeah, she and some dude got
in a nasty argument earlier.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.057
I had to get security involved.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.065
I wouldn't call it
an argument.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.372
- What would you call it?
- Uh, a conversation.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.982
Even though security
was called in?

06:13.982 --> 06:15.418
Everybody overreacted.

06:15.418 --> 06:18.073
We were just talking.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.771
Hannah and I were friends.
I was her first agent.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.512
I launched her career.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.340
Not only that, I introduced
her to King Matisse,

06:24.340 --> 06:25.907
for God's sake.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.170
- King who?
- Matisse.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.651
- He's a rapper.
- Oh.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.088
So that's Hannah's boyfriend?

06:33.088 --> 06:35.612
Yeah.
For the past six months.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.135
Okay,
so iron this out for us.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.268
You and Hannah
were catching up.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.488
You guys were chatting
about what,

06:41.488 --> 06:43.272
butterflies and rainbows?

06:43.272 --> 06:44.839
And all of a sudden,
security kicked

06:44.839 --> 06:45.970
your ass out of the club?

06:45.970 --> 06:47.407
Drake, you're leaving
something out.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.582
No, I never said
we were talking

06:48.582 --> 06:50.453
about butterflies and rainbows.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.672
What were you talking about?

06:51.672 --> 06:53.325
Business.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.675
Hannah screwed me.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.851
Fired me just as
she was about to blow up,

06:56.851 --> 06:58.505
said she wanted to make
a change, all that,

06:58.505 --> 06:59.897
but it wasn't her idea.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.464
It was Matisse's.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.944
He convinced Hannah
she needed to be

07:02.944 --> 07:06.208
with more of an urban agent,
all that nonsense.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.296
Sounds like
you're more pissed

07:07.296 --> 07:08.558
with Matisse than with Hannah.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.473
Yeah, but he didn't
feel like talking.

07:10.473 --> 07:13.171
Got up in my face, told me
he was gonna kick my ass.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.521
Next thing I know,
security guard's

07:14.521 --> 07:15.565
bouncing me out of the club.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.262
What time was this?

07:17.262 --> 07:19.830
Uh, around 11:00 or so. Um...

07:22.224 --> 07:25.357
11:06, to be precise.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.882
Modeling agent's
alibi checks out.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.884
So we got no leads
on the shooter?

07:29.884 --> 07:32.843
We don't know if he's
white, Black, brown,

07:32.843 --> 07:35.890
or whether the shooting
was random, targeted,

07:35.890 --> 07:37.761
racially motivated?

07:37.761 --> 07:39.371
For what it's worth,
I think it was targeted.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.764
Killer went in there
to shoot Hannah.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.984
The other two women
were hit by accident.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.420
- Based on what?
- Odds.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.074
I mean, what are the chances?

07:46.074 --> 07:48.685
The only murder victim
in a random club shooting

07:48.685 --> 07:51.340
just so happens to be a famous
rapper's model girlfriend?

07:51.340 --> 07:52.863
I mean, doesn't seem
very random to me.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.952
And if the shooter
wanted a body count,

07:54.952 --> 07:55.910
he would have found it.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.172
Place was packed.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.608
And he didn't shoot the barback

07:58.608 --> 08:00.088
who was with the vic downstairs.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.437
Look, I get it,

08:01.437 --> 08:04.048
but we need evidence,
not theories.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.397
Let's track down all the people

08:05.397 --> 08:06.660
who were in the club
that night.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.924
Waitresses, bartenders,
bouncers, patrons.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.318
Find out what they know.
Somebody had to see something.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.450
Yeah, and what the hell
is going on

08:14.450 --> 08:15.582
with that surveillance video?

08:15.582 --> 08:17.018
I just called the manager.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.585
Claims there was some sort
of tech issue.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.151
Yeah, that has
taken too long.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.850
Let's get a subpoena
for their surveillance system.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.156
And why don't you two
go track down

08:25.156 --> 08:26.941
that rapper who she was dating?

08:36.254 --> 08:37.560
Excuse me.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.475
We're homicide detectives.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.739
We need to ask you
about Hannah Gray.

08:42.739 --> 08:45.612
It's a hell of a thing, man.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.135
Can't believe she really gone.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.137
She was special.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.835
Like, for real.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.924
So what y'all wanna know?
- Well, for starters,

08:53.924 --> 08:56.797
why didn't you stick around
after the shooting?

08:56.797 --> 08:59.364
Things got crazy, man,
so I just--

08:59.364 --> 09:00.627
I bounced.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.499
And when you bounced,
did you know

09:03.499 --> 09:04.761
that Hannah had been shot
at the time?

09:04.761 --> 09:06.502
Yo, what you trying to say?

09:06.502 --> 09:07.764
I'm just trying
to understand why

09:07.764 --> 09:09.853
the dead girl's boyfriend
didn't stick around.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.594
Like I said,
things got crazy,

09:11.594 --> 09:13.465
so I got the hell out of there.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.554
I thought Hannah did the same.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.077
You see the shooter?

09:16.077 --> 09:17.426
Not really.

09:17.426 --> 09:18.645
Saw some dude
rolling towards us.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.081
Looked out of place.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.909
Had one of them
hospital masks on, you know?

09:21.909 --> 09:23.563
Then I saw
the metal in his hand,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.042
knew he was looking
to do business.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.479
So that's when I stepped to him
and tried to grab it,

09:27.479 --> 09:29.177
and he spun around
and started shooting.

09:29.177 --> 09:31.092
So you did see the shooter.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.181
- Just a glimpse.
- Was he Black, white?

09:33.181 --> 09:35.792
Couldn't tell. It was dark.
He had a mask on.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.620
And you tried
to grab the gun?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.535
Yeah, but he slipped away
and started shooting.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.015
Yo, look, I wish I could
have done more.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.626
Did it appear like
he was targeting Hannah?

09:43.626 --> 09:45.410
I don't know, man.
It all happened so fast.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.195
Are you aware of any reason

09:47.195 --> 09:48.892
somebody might have wanted
to hurt Hannah?

09:50.764 --> 09:52.853
- No, not that I know of.
- What about you?

09:52.853 --> 09:54.419
Anybody out there
trying to hurt you?

09:56.465 --> 09:59.381
Half the damn city, man.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.556
Why is that?

10:00.556 --> 10:02.036
Because I speak my mind.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.646
And these days,
people can't appreciate that,

10:03.646 --> 10:05.213
so I got a lot of haters.

10:05.213 --> 10:08.085
Especially in the
LGBTQ community, yeah?

10:08.085 --> 10:09.826
Sound like you've been
reading the gossip pages.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.349
Yeah.

10:11.349 --> 10:14.744
Look, people took all those
comments out of context.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.659
It shouldn't be that hard to
talk about things affecting--

10:16.659 --> 10:19.357
And it shouldn't be this hard
to get a straight answer.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.750
Excuse me?

10:20.750 --> 10:22.447
Has anybody threatened
you recently?

10:25.842 --> 10:27.844
Two days ago,
some dude stepped to me.

10:27.844 --> 10:31.413
He said I deserve to die
a slow, painful death.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.807
Ain't that something?

10:40.074 --> 10:41.597
So King Matisse has
his own sneaker line?

10:41.597 --> 10:42.642
Yeah.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.904
Popular as hell too.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.993
Why, may I ask?

10:45.993 --> 10:47.342
Why--why what?

10:47.342 --> 10:49.344
Why does a rapper
have a sneaker line?

10:49.344 --> 10:52.173
I mean, he's not very athletic
on stage, standing there,

10:52.173 --> 10:54.784
swearing, rapping,
wearing lots of jewelry.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.307
Ugh.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.874
That might be--yeah, no,
it is the whitest thing

10:57.874 --> 10:59.136
I've ever heard in my life.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.834
It's actually kind of cute.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.444
Excuse me.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.838
Were you working here
two days ago?

11:04.838 --> 11:06.535
We're homicide detectives.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.971
We understand that
there was an altercation

11:07.971 --> 11:09.407
with the rapper King Matisse.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.539
Mm-hmm.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.062
Evidently,
somebody came up to him

11:12.062 --> 11:14.978
and said that he deserved
to die a slow, painful death?

11:14.978 --> 11:16.371
No, what we said was,

11:16.371 --> 11:18.939
I'm gonna beat your punk ass
into the ground.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.724
- So you heard that?
- No.

11:21.724 --> 11:22.856
I said it.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.553
- Oh.
- You said it?

11:24.553 --> 11:26.207
Yeah.
I tried keeping my mouth shut.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.774
I couldn't help it.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.732
Matisse was here
signing autographs,

11:29.732 --> 11:33.214
promoting his new shoe line,
and it made me crazy.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.911
Here he is,
all rich and famous,

11:34.911 --> 11:37.087
millions of followers,
and what's he do?

11:37.087 --> 11:39.176
Bashes the gay community,
drops the F-word.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.874
So you confronted him?

11:40.874 --> 11:42.223
Hell yeah.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.746
When the event was over,
I went up to him,

11:43.746 --> 11:46.140
and I told him how disgusting
I thought his posts were.

11:46.140 --> 11:50.448
He told me to get lost,
pushed me, and I snapped.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.407
I started yelling,
and then security got involved,

11:52.407 --> 11:54.235
and he took off.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.237
Did you see Matisse again?

11:56.237 --> 11:58.587
You know, track him down,
try to finish what you started?

11:58.587 --> 11:59.544
What? No.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.982
I said my piece,
and that was it.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.202
Wait.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.378
You don't think that I--
- Not really.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.554
But we're still
gonna need an alibi.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.080
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.213
Mason's alibi is solid,
so we're nowhere.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.085
What about the other
two shooting victims?

12:18.085 --> 12:19.303
Are they doing okay?
- Yeah.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.652
They're both
in stable condition.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.132
Well, that's good news.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.831
Bad news is, neither one
of them saw anything.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.137
I was just with the guys
from Computer Crimes,

12:27.137 --> 12:28.835
trying to find
the surveillance video.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.662
Turns out it was deleted.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.186
What? Deleted?

12:32.186 --> 12:34.275
Well, can't they just
retrieve it from the cloud?

12:34.275 --> 12:36.799
It was deleted
from there too.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.061
All right.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.194
Track down this manager
right away.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.981
Look, I'm just responsible
for making sure

12:44.981 --> 12:46.287
the place is packed,

12:46.287 --> 12:50.204
you know, with models,
rappers, ballers.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.422
Surveillance isn't my domain.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.033
Whose domain is it, then?

12:53.033 --> 12:54.599
The owner.

12:54.599 --> 12:57.167
Or, you know, one of the firms
he hired to manage

12:57.167 --> 12:59.126
all of our tech stuff--not me.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.649
Well, the owner's been
in London this past week,

13:00.649 --> 13:02.259
so that just leaves
the tech firms.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.913
You got a name?

13:03.913 --> 13:06.524
No, but I'll find out.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.656
Oh, good.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.005
Yeah, yeah. No problem.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.181
I'll call you.

13:11.181 --> 13:14.663
No, we'll wait.

13:14.663 --> 13:18.798
Or you can just stop lying
and tell us what you know.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.016
Yo, I'm not lying.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.191
Hey, look, man, I ain't had

13:21.191 --> 13:22.323
nothing to do
with that shooting.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.498
How about the missing video?

13:23.498 --> 13:25.500
You got something
to do with that?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.589
Look, we're gonna
find out sooner or later,

13:27.589 --> 13:29.286
and if it's later and we
find out you're involved,

13:29.286 --> 13:31.549
it's gonna sting,
I promise you.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.378
Okay, I--

13:36.380 --> 13:39.122
I deleted
the surveillance video.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.471
That's a good start,
young man.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.169
Now you're gonna tell us why.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.001
You paid the nightclub manager
100 grand

13:48.001 --> 13:50.177
to delete
the surveillance video,

13:50.177 --> 13:53.484
video that could have helped us
find the killer.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.661
The man that shot
your girlfriend.

13:56.661 --> 14:00.013
Now, why would
you do that, bro?

14:00.013 --> 14:01.014
I'm not talking, fellas.

14:01.014 --> 14:05.801
So, uh, if you don't mind.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.150
Sit down. Now.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.760
You got no right
to talk to me like that.

14:08.760 --> 14:13.983
You paid somebody to destroy
evidence in a murder case.

14:13.983 --> 14:17.204
And there's gotta be a reason.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.901
So just tell us.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.606
I want a lawyer.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.180
Now.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.620
Like I told the female
detective on the phone,

14:42.620 --> 14:44.709
I was near the dance floor,
carrying a tray of drinks,

14:44.709 --> 14:46.059
and I heard gunshots.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.278
At first I thought
maybe someone

14:48.278 --> 14:50.063
was lighting off firecrackers.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.891
Then I heard everyone
start screaming.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.675
Did you see the shooter?

14:53.675 --> 14:56.286
Sort of, like,
out of the corner of my eye.

14:56.286 --> 14:58.114
But I was close
to Matisse and Hannah,

14:58.114 --> 14:59.768
so that's where my eyes
sort of focused.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.857
And they ran off
in different directions?

15:01.857 --> 15:03.380
Correct.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.253
Did King Matisse run
towards the shooter?

15:06.253 --> 15:08.908
No, he ran
in the opposite direction.

15:08.908 --> 15:12.346
So just so we're clear,
he didn't confront the shooter

15:12.346 --> 15:14.348
or try to grab the gun?
- Grab the gun?

15:14.348 --> 15:16.089
No. He ran into the bathroom.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.047
The bathroom?

15:18.047 --> 15:19.701
Yeah.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.660
I just remember feeling
really disappointed.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.097
By what?

15:24.097 --> 15:26.577
The fact Matisse did nothing
to protect his lady.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.144
- Hmm.
- I'm a big fan.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.059
Was, anyway.
- Yeah.

15:30.059 --> 15:33.280
My advice has always been,
never meet your heroes.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.151
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.284
Oh, one more thing.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.155
The shooter was wearing
a blue hat.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.592
You know, like, a knit cap.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.682
He ran?

15:44.682 --> 15:46.815
That's why
he deleted the video?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.904
Not a lot of street cred
in being a coward.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.166
Son of a bitch.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.776
He screws up
our homicide investigation

15:51.776 --> 15:54.344
to protect his fake
tough guy image.

15:54.344 --> 15:57.478
I want you to charge him
with obstruction, tampering,

15:57.478 --> 15:59.175
and any other crimes
you can think of.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.307
With pleasure.

16:00.307 --> 16:03.397
Hey, take a look.

16:03.397 --> 16:07.009
11:36 p.m., nine minutes
after the 911 call.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.316
The bodega is six blocks
north of the crime scene.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.795
Yeah, it fits
the general height

16:10.795 --> 16:13.537
and build of the suspect,
and he's wearing a dark hat.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.496
Did any of the witnesses
mention that the shooter

16:15.496 --> 16:17.237
was wearing red boots?

16:17.237 --> 16:18.629
No.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.283
You should head over
to the bodega right now.

16:22.546 --> 16:26.028
11:36, two nights ago.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.377
I'll find it.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.988
Not a problem.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.337
I got new cameras too.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.034
I let everyone know.

16:32.034 --> 16:35.777
Okay, got it. 11:36.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.431
Is this the man
you're looking for?

16:37.431 --> 16:39.215
That's the one.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.695
Well, it's your lucky day.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.045
I--I know him
from the neighborhood.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.655
His name's Bishop Bell.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.222
He's a good kid.
- Wait, wait, wait, hold--

16:46.222 --> 16:47.528
Bishop Bell?

16:47.528 --> 16:49.051
The ball player?
He went to Hudson?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.531
Yeah, yeah.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.750
Yeah, he was a star
until he hurt his knee.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.057
So this kid Bishop,
when he came in that night,

16:55.057 --> 16:56.189
how was he acting?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.365
Normal, good mood, bad mood?

16:58.365 --> 17:00.671
No, no.
He was--he was distracted.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.847
He bought a--a 40
and a pack of cigarettes,

17:02.847 --> 17:05.415
which I thought
was kind of odd and sad.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.504
You know, he used to be
a really good athlete.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.202
I said something to him too.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.681
I told him
he shouldn't be smoking.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.467
What did he say?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.338
Said he was having
a bad night,

17:15.338 --> 17:18.254
feeling real nervous,
needed to calm down.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.995
You know where this kid
Bishop lives?

17:27.785 --> 17:30.092
There he is.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.312
Bishop Bell, I'd like
to ask you a few questions--

17:32.312 --> 17:33.400
Damn it, come on.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.358
Hey, hey, hey. Move, move.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.447
27 Squad, we got
a suspect running north

17:37.447 --> 17:39.449
on Lenox Avenue
and 136th Street.

17:39.449 --> 17:42.322
Mr. Bell, NYPD!

17:42.322 --> 17:43.584
Stop!

18:00.601 --> 18:02.124
Stop running!

18:02.124 --> 18:03.343
Do not move!
- Stop!

18:07.129 --> 18:09.827
Stay down. Stay down.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.090
You know what?

18:11.090 --> 18:14.267
For a guy with a bum knee,

18:14.267 --> 18:15.877
I still got it.

18:22.971 --> 18:25.234
Like I said
for the hundredth time,

18:25.234 --> 18:28.411
I ain't got nothing to do
with that shooting.

18:28.411 --> 18:30.457
Hannah and I were tight.

18:30.457 --> 18:33.938
We weren't together at the
time, but we were close.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.766
Close?

18:35.766 --> 18:38.073
Really?

18:38.073 --> 18:39.727
That's what you call this?

18:39.727 --> 18:42.947
Because we got ahold of this
letter that you wrote Hannah

18:42.947 --> 18:45.602
two days
before she was gunned down.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.387
There's a lot
of great stuff in here.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.606
Here's my favorite part.

18:49.606 --> 18:53.001
"I can't describe
the rage I feel.

18:53.001 --> 18:56.265
"I hope it goes away,
but I don't think it will,

18:56.265 --> 19:00.400
not as long as you're alive."

19:02.141 --> 19:04.230
So? I was in love with her.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.406
That may be so.

19:06.406 --> 19:09.583
But Bishop,
this is not a love letter.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.801
I bet it hurt,
seeing her kicking it

19:10.801 --> 19:12.629
with a guy like King Matisse.

19:12.629 --> 19:15.632
Bentleys, G5s, VIP rooms.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.199
He's a legend, a real legend.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.766
What's that supposed to mean?

19:18.766 --> 19:20.420
It must have
been hard for you,

19:20.420 --> 19:23.988
seeing Hannah living it up,

19:23.988 --> 19:27.992
running with a crowd you just
can't run with anymore.

19:27.992 --> 19:33.172
And once you get a taste
of the good life, been famous,

19:33.172 --> 19:34.738
it's hard to forget.

19:34.738 --> 19:38.089
It's tough going back
to just being a regular Joe.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.004
Man, I always been poor.

19:40.004 --> 19:43.007
I've been about the game,
not the life.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.575
See, Bishop,

19:45.575 --> 19:48.535
you were right there.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.885
You don't blow your knee out,

19:50.885 --> 19:54.802
you'd have been living
that life 24/7, right?

19:54.802 --> 19:57.108
Now, come on. That had to hurt.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.505
It is what it is.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.334
Bishop, we know
you're the shooter.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.640
Hey, we know it.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.119
We know you're the shooter.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.687
And on some level,
I guess we understand

20:10.687 --> 20:13.037
the jealousy, the frustration.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.214
But if you play this right,
you admit it,

20:15.214 --> 20:19.870
you take responsibility,
you'll be out in less than 15,

20:19.870 --> 20:22.221
plenty of time
to have a normal life.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.100
Nah.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.710
I ain't talking.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.757
Lawyer.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.767
Yo, Detective.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.944
I was the number one recruit
in the country.

20:49.944 --> 20:56.516
I had offers from Duke,
North Carolina, UConn.

20:56.516 --> 20:59.519
I ain't never been
no regular Joe.

20:59.519 --> 21:03.305
Never was, never will be.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.709
No gun, no blood.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.059
I know. It's a tough case.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.496
All of the evidence
is circumstantial.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.455
There's this pathetic
and scary letter

21:22.455 --> 21:24.326
that we found
in Hannah's apartment

21:24.326 --> 21:27.721
and 67 unanswered phone calls
over a four-day period

21:27.721 --> 21:29.288
just prior to the murder.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.420
Can we put Bell at the scene?

21:31.420 --> 21:32.726
Sort of.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.162
What's that mean?

21:34.162 --> 21:36.686
Well, a cocktail waitress
said that the shooter

21:36.686 --> 21:38.253
was wearing a blue knit cap.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.777
Nine minutes later,
we've got video of Bell

21:40.777 --> 21:42.562
wearing a blue knit cap.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.694
He's buying a pack
of smokes at a bodega.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.479
It's just six blocks north
of the crime scene.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.613
I know. It's not a lot.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.355
But we are still
questioning witnesses.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.357
If we can't put Bell
at the crime scene,

21:55.357 --> 21:58.099
then we don't have a case.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.456
He was 30 feet away from me,
so I started running after him.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.675
That's real dangerous, bro.

22:08.675 --> 22:09.850
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.634
I just reacted, you know?

22:11.634 --> 22:14.376
Yeah, well, how long
were you chasing him?

22:14.376 --> 22:15.508
Not sure.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.466
10, maybe 20 seconds.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.076
I followed him
out the back door.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.643
I kept chasing him,
but I tripped.

22:20.643 --> 22:23.516
I stepped in something.
I'm not sure what it was.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.344
Can you describe
what he looked like,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.693
what he was wearing?

22:26.693 --> 22:29.391
He was tall,
about my height, thin,

22:29.391 --> 22:30.653
and he was wearing a blue hat.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.394
Was he wearing boots
or sneakers?

22:32.394 --> 22:34.004
No, I'm sorry.
I wish I could help.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.050
But I did get a photo of the
dude while I was chasing him.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.095
I mean, well,
I tried to, anyway,

22:38.095 --> 22:39.358
but it was too dark.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.837
I ran out the back door,

22:40.837 --> 22:42.665
saw him run past the cop car,
but then--

22:42.665 --> 22:44.754
Wait, wait. Cop car?

22:44.754 --> 22:46.626
What are you talking about,
cop car?

22:46.626 --> 22:47.757
There was a police car
parked right here.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.368
Dude ran right past it.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.717
Was there someone in the car?

22:50.717 --> 22:52.675
Yeah, a cop.

22:52.675 --> 22:55.069
When I got back up,
I walked over there,

22:55.069 --> 22:57.158
asked him why the hell
he was sitting in the car.

23:04.034 --> 23:06.515
Like I said before,
I got to the scene

23:06.515 --> 23:08.299
six minutes after the 911 call.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.301
So when you arrived,
the shooter had already fled?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.781
I think so.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.566
I mean, it was a mess,
people running and screaming.

23:13.566 --> 23:14.610
So you didn't
see the shooter?

23:14.610 --> 23:16.090
Correct.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.048
So when you got to the scene,
what'd you do?

23:19.789 --> 23:20.877
Excuse me?

23:20.877 --> 23:22.401
Did you stay in the car?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.533
Did you go inside and try
to render aid to the victims?

23:24.533 --> 23:27.406
Did you try to clear the club?
Did you search for the shooter?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.233
What'd you do?

23:29.233 --> 23:32.106
What the hell is this?

23:32.106 --> 23:34.064
We're just trying to figure
out what happened, that's it.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.284
No, you're looking to throw
someone under the bus.

23:36.284 --> 23:40.810
Yeah, case like this,
lots of press,

23:40.810 --> 23:43.073
police don't find the shooter,
someone takes a hit.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.945
The only reason we're here
is because

23:44.945 --> 23:47.164
there's a discrepancy
regarding the time

23:47.164 --> 23:48.688
that you showed up
on the scene, that's it.

23:48.688 --> 23:49.906
Discrepancy?

23:49.906 --> 23:51.560
Yeah, we checked your AVL.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.084
It says you arrived at the club
approximately three minutes

23:54.084 --> 23:56.217
after the call,
not six minutes.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.305
So what?

23:57.305 --> 23:59.263
So three minutes
is a long time.

23:59.263 --> 24:00.917
It's the difference
between seeing the shooter

24:00.917 --> 24:02.919
and not seeing the shooter.
- I already told you.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.139
We know
what you told us, Nick.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.923
Problem is,
we don't believe you.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.534
We need some answers.

24:08.534 --> 24:11.450
Answers to what?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.799
This.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.717
That's you, right?

24:17.717 --> 24:22.243
And the blurry dude,
that's the shooter.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.294
I'm done talking.

24:30.294 --> 24:33.907
You got any more questions,
call my PBA lawyer.

24:42.829 --> 24:48.269
Officer Riley, if you saw
the shooter fleeing the club,

24:48.269 --> 24:52.142
all right, we need you
to help us identify him.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.797
Like I told the detectives,
I didn't see the shooter.

24:54.797 --> 24:57.974
All right, he was already
gone by the time you arrived?

24:57.974 --> 24:59.106
That's correct.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.543
Yet one of the guests
at the club,

25:01.543 --> 25:03.676
someone who was chasing
after the suspect,

25:03.676 --> 25:06.287
said he saw the shooter
run past a police car

25:06.287 --> 25:07.549
parked outside the club.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.551
- What's your point?
- My point is that--

25:11.727 --> 25:14.077
We know Officer Riley
was there,

25:14.077 --> 25:15.296
that he saw the shooter.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.645
He just told you--

25:16.645 --> 25:17.777
I know what he just told me.

25:17.777 --> 25:20.127
I am telling you
what really happened.

25:22.825 --> 25:25.611
You need to end this charade

25:25.611 --> 25:28.614
and--and tell us what you saw.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.920
I'm sorry.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.009
I'm sorry, I didn't see him.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.273
That young woman's murder
isn't on you.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.405
You understand that, right?

25:37.405 --> 25:38.754
Like, whether you were there

25:38.754 --> 25:40.930
three minutes after
the 911 call or six minutes,

25:40.930 --> 25:42.715
there's nothing you could have
done to prevent her death.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.238
I know that.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.675
But it's not that--

25:46.675 --> 25:49.983
It's not what, it--

25:51.637 --> 25:52.725
It's not that simple?

25:52.725 --> 25:54.291
Is that what
you were gonna say?

25:54.291 --> 25:58.644
There is no law
that requires police officers

25:58.644 --> 26:00.776
to be heroic,
to jump out of their car

26:00.776 --> 26:03.562
and tackle
a dangerous criminal.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.564
Maybe you got nervous, or--

26:05.564 --> 26:10.960
or you weren't sure whether
to engage or call for backup.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.266
It happens.

26:12.266 --> 26:16.270
But this is your chance
to make this right,

26:16.270 --> 26:19.142
to redeem yourself,

26:19.142 --> 26:21.580
and to help get justice
for Hannah Gray.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.539
No? Okay.

26:24.539 --> 26:27.934
Just so you know,
if you stick to your story,

26:27.934 --> 26:31.024
I will dig even deeper into
the exact sequence of events,

26:31.024 --> 26:32.678
and if your story proves
to be inaccurate...

26:32.678 --> 26:34.027
Now, hold on a second.

26:34.027 --> 26:36.203
I will file
criminal charges,

26:36.203 --> 26:40.642
which means you will lose
your job and your pension.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.097
All right.

27:07.451 --> 27:10.759
I was in the patrol car.

27:10.759 --> 27:13.240
People were running
and screaming.

27:16.547 --> 27:21.030
I saw a guy sprinting
toward me, wearing a mask,

27:21.030 --> 27:23.076
with a gun in his right hand.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.820
Do you remember
what he was wearing,

27:27.820 --> 27:30.649
color of his jacket,
his hat, shoes?

27:32.215 --> 27:33.913
Yeah, I do.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.093
The people seek remand,
Your Honor.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.921
Given the severity
of the charges,

27:41.921 --> 27:43.705
the defendant is a flight risk.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.620
He's also a risk
to public safety,

27:45.620 --> 27:47.622
given that he shot up
a nightclub

27:47.622 --> 27:49.450
filled with young men
and women,

27:49.450 --> 27:50.930
injuring two and killing one.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.454
I mean, clearly he has
no reservations

27:53.454 --> 27:54.760
about harming young people.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.066
Which in New York
is totally irrelevant

27:57.066 --> 27:59.460
for the purposes of bail.
- Agreed.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.766
So let's move on.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.289
Mr. Powell,
what's your position on bail?

28:02.289 --> 28:03.899
This case is based
on a series

28:03.899 --> 28:06.206
of coincidences
and suppositions.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.904
There is no actual evidence
to tie Mr. Bell

28:08.904 --> 28:11.733
to the crime scene,
let alone the murder.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.430
He has no prior arrests
or convictions,

28:13.430 --> 28:16.259
and he has substantial ties
to the city of New York.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.131
He was a high school
basketball star

28:18.131 --> 28:20.699
at Harper Field in the Bronx,
and he played collegiately

28:20.699 --> 28:22.831
at Hudson University.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.485
As such, we request
that bail be set

28:24.485 --> 28:26.095
no higher than $100,000.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.141
Defendant is remanded.
Next case.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.708
Your Honor,
my client deserves--

28:29.708 --> 28:30.796
He's remanded.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.015
Next case.

28:33.015 --> 28:36.018
No murder weapon,
no blood evidence,

28:36.018 --> 28:38.891
no clear photo or video
of the defendant

28:38.891 --> 28:40.719
anywhere near the crime scene.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.677
Other than that,
it's perfect.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.026
Yeah.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.768
The truth is, the whole case
rests on our ability

28:46.768 --> 28:48.988
to put Bishop Bell
in that club.

28:48.988 --> 28:50.206
Which means it all comes down

28:50.206 --> 28:53.688
to the testimony
of Officer Riley.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.255
You're right.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.823
Question is,
will the jury buy

28:57.823 --> 29:01.391
the testimony of a coward cop?

29:01.391 --> 29:03.002
That's pretty harsh.

29:03.002 --> 29:06.701
I'm not judging the man,
just telling you

29:06.701 --> 29:09.182
how he's gonna be portrayed.

29:09.182 --> 29:12.315
So you need to bolster
his credibility,

29:12.315 --> 29:14.448
make sure the jury knows

29:14.448 --> 29:17.146
he shouldn't be defined
by this one incident.

29:17.146 --> 29:20.019
Find ways to humanize him.

29:20.019 --> 29:23.979
Might help offset
his moment of weakness.

29:29.680 --> 29:34.033
The defendant and Hannah Gray
dated for three years.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.686
And they broke up last year,

29:35.686 --> 29:39.865
just as Ms. Gray's modeling and
acting career began to soar.

29:39.865 --> 29:43.216
A few months later,
she began dating

29:43.216 --> 29:47.524
a highly-acclaimed musician
named King Matisse.

29:47.524 --> 29:53.052
This relationship
triggered every frustration

29:53.052 --> 29:57.578
and insecurity lurking
deep inside the defendant,

29:57.578 --> 30:01.190
forced him to confront
the fact that he was no longer

30:01.190 --> 30:05.673
an up-and-coming NBA prospect
with an unlimited future,

30:05.673 --> 30:07.414
and that the love of his life

30:07.414 --> 30:10.069
was now jet-setting
around the globe

30:10.069 --> 30:12.941
with a rich and famous rapper.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.988
Two days before he shot
and killed Hannah,

30:15.988 --> 30:20.253
he sent her a "love letter"

30:20.253 --> 30:23.952
rife with ominous threats
and accusations.

30:26.172 --> 30:30.916
"Hope you're enjoying life now,
'cause it's gonna end soon.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.482
"I always thought
you were different,

30:32.482 --> 30:34.006
"that you were special.

30:34.006 --> 30:36.443
Turns out, you're just
another fame-chasing ho."

30:36.443 --> 30:39.707
There are a lot
more insults in this letter,

30:39.707 --> 30:43.580
I can assure you, all of them
exhibiting rage and jealousy.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.408
But that's not why we're here.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.236
A lot of people
have sent foolish

30:47.236 --> 30:49.891
and emotional texts
to their exes.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.284
No, the reason we're here

30:51.284 --> 30:55.157
is that the defendant
actually acted

30:55.157 --> 30:58.595
on his rage and jealousy.

30:58.595 --> 31:02.164
On December 19th,
he entered the Red Envy Club

31:02.164 --> 31:04.166
with a 9-millimeter handgun

31:04.166 --> 31:09.824
and began hunting down
Hannah Gray.

31:09.824 --> 31:12.000
He fired off eight rounds,

31:12.000 --> 31:18.441
injuring two and killing one.

31:18.441 --> 31:22.184
Several witnesses will help
verify that the defendant

31:22.184 --> 31:24.360
was the gunman, that he was
present at the crime scene,

31:24.360 --> 31:28.495
including
a decorated police officer

31:28.495 --> 31:33.065
with commendations for
integrity, community service,

31:33.065 --> 31:35.894
and bravery
in the line of duty.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.773
I know this goes
without saying,

31:45.773 --> 31:48.254
but just answer the questions
truthfully and succinctly.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.646
Got it.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.953
You should also know
that I am going to address

31:51.953 --> 31:54.434
your earlier misstatements.

31:54.434 --> 31:58.090
Try to get out
in front of all that.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.527
And when it comes up
on cross, once again,

32:00.527 --> 32:02.007
just tell the truth.

32:02.007 --> 32:05.749
No need to explain
or rationalize.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.055
Right.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.145
I know this is difficult.

32:10.145 --> 32:12.017
It's a lot more than that.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.584
I've been a cop a long time.

32:14.584 --> 32:18.893
I got three cousins
and an uncle on the job too.

32:20.677 --> 32:25.160
So you don't need to tell me
what this is, all right?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.338
Sorry to put you
in this position.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.864
But I don't have a choice.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.564
Just do the best you can, okay?

32:42.482 --> 32:46.051
I got a call
from dispatch at 11:27.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.488
I was in the area,
so I rolled to the scene.

32:48.488 --> 32:50.794
And what time did you arrive
at the Red Envy Club?

32:50.794 --> 32:52.448
Approximately 11:30.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.233
Can you describe
what you saw?

32:55.582 --> 32:57.714
People running and screaming.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.761
It was very chaotic.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.502
- Did you hear gunshots?
- Yeah.

33:02.502 --> 33:03.982
Two, maybe three.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.766
What did you do?

33:05.766 --> 33:08.160
I called for--for backup.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.032
While you were waiting
for backup to arrive,

33:11.032 --> 33:13.034
what did you see?

33:13.034 --> 33:15.689
I saw more people
running and screaming,

33:15.689 --> 33:20.999
and I also saw a man with a gun
running out of the building.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.045
Could you describe him
and what he was wearing?

33:24.045 --> 33:27.179
He was tall, about 6 foot.

33:27.179 --> 33:31.226
Um, and he was wearing
a winter coat.

33:31.226 --> 33:34.099
And he had, um,
a mask covering his face.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.752
Was he wearing a hat?

33:35.752 --> 33:38.190
Yes. A blue knit cap.

33:38.190 --> 33:41.584
Did you notice what kind
of shoes he was wearing?

33:41.584 --> 33:43.412
Boots.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.066
Red Timberlands.

33:46.546 --> 33:49.592
Does this man
resemble the man you saw

33:49.592 --> 33:52.552
fleeing the club
with the gun in his hand?

33:52.552 --> 33:54.249
Yes.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.208
Same height and build, and he's
wearing the same hat and boots

33:56.208 --> 33:58.340
I saw on the shooter.

33:58.340 --> 34:01.691
Did you provide
this information

34:01.691 --> 34:05.086
to Detectives Cosgrove and Shaw
when they first talked to you?

34:06.783 --> 34:08.524
No, I did not.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.091
Why not?

34:11.832 --> 34:13.616
Because...

34:19.361 --> 34:20.754
'Cause I didn't want
anyone to know

34:20.754 --> 34:24.062
that I stayed in the patrol car
and didn't engage

34:24.062 --> 34:26.107
with the suspect.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.196
Thank you. Nothing further.

34:30.459 --> 34:33.158
Officer Riley, you described
the scene as chaotic,

34:33.158 --> 34:36.422
lots of people
running and screaming.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.599
It was late at night,
so it was also very dark,

34:39.599 --> 34:42.167
which means
you can't be certain

34:42.167 --> 34:43.951
of what the man
with the gun looked like,

34:43.951 --> 34:47.781
or how tall he was,
or what color hat

34:47.781 --> 34:49.130
or boots he was wearing.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.784
Isn't that right?

34:50.784 --> 34:53.091
Uh, I mean, as for the
height, it's--it's impossible

34:53.091 --> 34:55.267
to know for sure.

34:55.267 --> 34:56.659
Like I said,
he looked--he looked

34:56.659 --> 34:58.531
pretty tall, about 6 foot.

34:58.531 --> 35:03.884
But the hat was blue, and the--
the boots were red Timberlands.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.887
My kid has the exact same pair.
I know what they look like.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.541
I mean, I know what they cost.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.543
- Okay.
- You kidding me?

35:10.543 --> 35:11.935
Okay.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.155
Sounds like you got
a good look at the shooter.

35:14.155 --> 35:17.158
But like you just said,
you lied

35:17.158 --> 35:21.380
to the homicide detectives
about this, correct?

35:25.427 --> 35:26.515
Yes.

35:26.515 --> 35:28.169
When they asked you
the first time

35:28.169 --> 35:30.737
if you saw the shooter,
you said no.

35:30.737 --> 35:35.394
You said you got there
six minutes after the 911 call,

35:35.394 --> 35:37.744
not three.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.182
Correct.

35:41.182 --> 35:44.751
And the reason
you did this was

35:44.751 --> 35:46.274
because you didn't
want anyone to know

35:46.274 --> 35:47.493
that you were a coward.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.886
- Objection.
- Sustained.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.193
I will rephrase.

35:52.193 --> 35:55.588
You didn't want anyone to know
that you chose to remain

35:55.588 --> 35:58.025
in your police vehicle,
rather than trying

35:58.025 --> 35:59.331
to apprehend the suspect.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.249
- Correct.
- Objection.

36:04.249 --> 36:07.034
Your Honor,
I've already been over this.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.644
Overruled.

36:08.644 --> 36:11.995
So, Officer Riley,
you deliberately subverted

36:11.995 --> 36:14.215
a homicide investigation because

36:14.215 --> 36:16.217
you were ashamed
of your cowardice.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.703
Correct.

36:23.703 --> 36:27.881
So you admit that you lied
to two fellow police officers,

36:27.881 --> 36:31.667
and yet you expect the jury
to believe your testimony.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.669
Yes, I do,
because I'm telling the truth.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.367
So you lie sometimes
and tell the truth other times.

36:35.367 --> 36:36.455
Is that what you're saying?

36:36.455 --> 36:37.630
No, that is not
what I'm saying.

36:37.630 --> 36:40.546
I'm saying I lied
because I was ashamed,

36:40.546 --> 36:45.551
and that when I saw
the suspect fleeing,

36:45.551 --> 36:47.770
I--

36:47.770 --> 36:48.902
I froze.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.556
You were afraid?

36:50.556 --> 36:52.732
You were worried about
your own personal safety,

36:52.732 --> 36:55.300
rather than the safety
of the innocent men and women

36:55.300 --> 36:57.040
you are paid to protect.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.041
No, I wasn't afraid.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.260
I just chose--

36:59.260 --> 37:01.393
I chose not to engage, right?

37:01.393 --> 37:05.919
I mean, like I said before,
I--I froze.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.748
Yet you were able to describe
what the shooter was wearing.

37:08.748 --> 37:13.274
How can you freeze and process
detailed information

37:13.274 --> 37:14.406
at the same time?

37:14.406 --> 37:16.146
That--that doesn't make sense.

37:16.146 --> 37:21.151
Either you froze, in which case

37:21.151 --> 37:24.111
you didn't see the suspect
fleeing the club,

37:24.111 --> 37:29.421
or you were afraid,

37:29.421 --> 37:31.379
which means--
- Which means I'm human.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.902
That's it. That's all it means.

37:32.902 --> 37:35.122
Which means on that night,
at that one moment,

37:35.122 --> 37:37.646
I chose not to engage.

37:37.646 --> 37:40.170
Where were you the other
500 times I did engage?

37:40.170 --> 37:41.563
Where I risked my life?

37:41.563 --> 37:43.173
So you admit
that you were a coward

37:43.173 --> 37:44.392
on the night in question.
- No, I do not.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.133
I do not admit that.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.439
I just--

37:53.445 --> 37:56.230
I just--I just didn't--

37:56.230 --> 38:00.147
I just didn't respond the way
that I--that I should have,

38:00.147 --> 38:03.150
the way that I normally do.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.805
But I'm a good cop.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.329
I am.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.593
I may not be perfect
or--or a hero...

38:13.900 --> 38:15.162
But I saw the shooter.

38:15.162 --> 38:16.903
I saw a man
with Bishop Bell's build,

38:16.903 --> 38:20.167
wearing a blue hat
and red Timberland boots,

38:20.167 --> 38:21.647
running out of that club,

38:21.647 --> 38:23.388
waving a gun
with his right hand.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.477
So you can insult me
all you want,

38:25.477 --> 38:28.131
but I know what I saw.

38:45.235 --> 38:46.628
Morning, Nolan.

38:46.628 --> 38:48.717
Morning.

38:48.717 --> 38:52.155
Fairly sure I'm the only
person in the office

38:52.155 --> 38:54.506
who still stops
at the newsstand.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.464
Surprised they still exist.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.816
He doesn't deserve this.

39:00.816 --> 39:04.690
He just--he froze.

39:04.690 --> 39:10.260
Let's face it.
Most people are just people.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.958
That's what makes heroes
so special, right?

39:11.958 --> 39:14.090
By definition, they're
willing to do the things

39:14.090 --> 39:17.224
that most people aren't.

39:17.224 --> 39:20.053
This isn't on you, Nolan.

39:20.053 --> 39:22.098
You did the right thing.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.756
Jury's back.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.764
<i>All rise.</i>

39:51.214 --> 39:54.087
Mr. Foreman, have you
agreed upon a verdict?

39:54.087 --> 39:55.305
Yes, Your Honor.

39:56.611 --> 39:59.309
We find the defendant,
Bishop Bell,

39:59.309 --> 40:02.965
guilty of murder
in the second degree.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.925
Listen to me.
I cannot go to jail.

40:05.925 --> 40:08.841
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

40:19.242 --> 40:21.680
- You Nolan Price?
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

40:23.812 --> 40:25.597
Son of a bitch!
I hope you're happy!

40:25.597 --> 40:27.642
Hope you feel good
about all this,

40:27.642 --> 40:29.122
ruining the life of a good cop!

40:31.254 --> 40:32.386
Hey, you okay?

40:32.386 --> 40:34.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.520
What the hell was that about?

40:37.522 --> 40:39.611
What? What is it?

40:39.611 --> 40:41.830
Story just broke.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.442
What story?

40:44.442 --> 40:47.619
Riley committed suicide
a couple hours ago.
