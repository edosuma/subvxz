Yes, but I'm afraid there won't

snowed one bit.

we have a couple of horses

04:33.239 --> 04:35.141
visiting us
this morning.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.945
We just met a really pretty
horse named Snowflake.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.446
And if there was snow,

04:40.513 --> 04:42.615
she could take us
on a sleigh ride.

04:42.682 --> 04:45.785
Cool! I wish
we could go on a sleigh ride.

04:45.852 --> 04:50.156
Oh, that reminds me: it's about
time for us to get our tree.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.959
I'm going to make a horsey
ornament for the tree.

Horses are really strong
and fast.

because you can ride them

05:02.435 --> 05:05.505
and they have
long, pretty hair.

are wonderful animals.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.413
Horses eat lots
of hay and grass,

05:13.479 --> 05:16.215
but they also
love to eat...

05:19.052 --> 05:20.353
{\an3}Apples!

05:20.420 --> 05:22.055
Apples, right!

05:22.121 --> 05:24.757
And horses are so
big and strong,

05:24.824 --> 05:27.560
they can pull
a big, heavy...

05:30.396 --> 05:31.597
{\an3}Sleigh.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.599
A sleigh!
That's right.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.602
And if you want to ride
on a horse's back,

05:36.669 --> 05:40.540
you put a seat
on it called a...

05:42.942 --> 05:44.143
{\an3}Saddle!

05:44.210 --> 05:47.146

{\an1}BOTH:
Okay.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.083
(Imitating horses)

10:51.150 --> 10:52.451
Good horsey.

10:52.518 --> 10:55.087
Now let's go
for a sleigh ride.

10:55.154 --> 10:59.125
All right! Neigh!

10:59.191 --> 11:02.194
{\an1}Hi! Oh--

11:02.261 --> 11:04.196
Wait, Goby--
I mean, Elmer.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.632
You forgot the sleigh!

11:06.699 --> 11:08.167
(Laughing)

11:08.234 --> 11:09.702
Come on, Molly.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.671
We're making decorations
for the Christmas tree.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.007
Come with us!

11:20.212 --> 11:22.748
Giddy-up, Snowflake.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.319
We're making decorations
for the tree.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.321
I'm making
one of a sleigh.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.290
I'm making a horse.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.093
I made a horseshoe.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.028
Horses wear shoes?

11:36.095 --> 11:37.463
They sure do.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.099
A horse's foot
is called a hoof.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.600
That's right.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.470
And horseshoes help protect
their hooves.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.606
Hey, you guys, look!
It's snowing.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.977
{\an5}It's snowing!

11:49.241 --> 11:51.977
It's so pretty.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.181
Maybe Snowflake
can take us on a sleigh ride.

11:55.247 --> 11:57.283
Yeah, that'd be so cool.

11:57.349 --> 12:02.421
Okay, snow ponies. Bundle up,
it's time to go outside.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.915
BOTH:
Princess patrol!

12:29.982 --> 12:31.350
Once upon a time...

12:31.417 --> 12:35.087
There were two royal princesses
who were on patrol

12:35.154 --> 12:37.223
in the magic forest.

12:37.289 --> 12:42.328
It's our job to protect the
magical creatures of the forest.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.597
WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO:
<i>Attention, princesses.</i>

12:44.663 --> 12:48.167
<i>A unicorn has been spotted</i>
<i>at the top of Prancy Peak.</i>

12:48.234 --> 12:50.336
A unicorn?!

12:50.402 --> 12:52.037
Royally awesome.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.441
<i>And be on the lookout</i>
<i>for the shoo-er.</i>

12:55.508 --> 12:57.810
The shoo-er?

12:57.877 --> 13:00.679
<i>He'll try to shoo</i>
<i>your horses away.</i>

13:00.746 --> 13:02.681
{\an1}Oh, boy.

13:04.750 --> 13:08.387
{\an5}NONNY, NARRATING:
But as soon as they started up
the road towards Prancy Peak...

13:08.454 --> 13:11.724
HORSES:
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

13:11.790 --> 13:14.426
Oh, no!
This road is really rocky,

13:14.493 --> 13:19.131
and the rocks are hurting
the royal horses' feet.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.233
Well, that's
a royal pain.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.468
What do we do?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.203
NONNY:
When suddenly...

13:24.270 --> 13:26.639
Shoo. Shoo, shoo!

13:26.705 --> 13:28.641
Shoo! Shoo!

13:28.707 --> 13:30.075
BOTH:
It's the shoo-er!

13:30.142 --> 13:31.944
(Whinnying)

13:32.011 --> 13:36.115
HORSES:
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

13:36.182 --> 13:37.950
Whoa, horsey.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.652
I think we lost him.

13:39.718 --> 13:42.788
And look,
there's Prancy Peak!

13:42.855 --> 13:44.890
{\an1}Let's go!

13:44.957 --> 13:48.260
Yeah, but the road is too rocky
for our horses to walk on.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.097
Let's walk them on the side of
the road, on the soft grass.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.866
{\an1}Good idea.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.035
Come on, horsey.

13:56.101 --> 13:59.672
{\an5}NONNY:
So the princesses walked their
horses on the soft grass.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.540
(Horses sighing)

14:01.607 --> 14:04.076
But once again...

14:04.143 --> 14:05.811
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

14:05.878 --> 14:08.347
(Whinnying)

14:08.414 --> 14:12.284
Oh, no! The shoo-er shooed
our horses away!

14:12.351 --> 14:14.386
Come back, horsies!

14:14.453 --> 14:18.591
{\an5}NONNY:
So the princesses went up the
mountain to find their horses.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.827
{\an5}I'm royally tired.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.827
{\an3}Me too.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.063
But we have to
find our horses

14:24.129 --> 14:26.131
before the shoo-er
shows up again.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.735
Uh-oh, look!
There are three paths ahead.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.004
Shoo, shoo!

14:32.071 --> 14:33.906
Oh, no! He's coming!

14:33.973 --> 14:37.710
We need your help to figure out
which way our horses went.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.413
This is what
horse tracks look like.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.582
Which one of these paths
has horse tracks?

14:46.619 --> 14:48.587
FISH:
That one right there!

14:48.654 --> 14:51.090
Yeah, that path
has horse tracks.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.525
Our horses
went that way.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.662
Hurry! Let's go!

14:58.497 --> 15:00.032
There they are!

15:02.968 --> 15:05.771
Horsey, what's wrong?

15:05.838 --> 15:08.674
Shoo, shoo!

15:08.741 --> 15:10.376
Shoo! Shoo!

15:10.442 --> 15:13.178
All right, that's enough!

15:13.245 --> 15:15.180
Shoo?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.950
No. I'm not going to shoo.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.718
{\an3}Wait, what?

15:19.785 --> 15:21.353
{\an1}Shoes!

15:21.420 --> 15:24.890
You need shoes for your horses.
My unicorn wears them.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.892
She's got hooves too!

15:26.959 --> 15:28.894
(Whistling)

15:31.130 --> 15:33.032
Hey, hey!

15:33.098 --> 15:35.467
BOTH:
The unicorn!

15:36.902 --> 15:39.938
Horses' hooves are soft
and wear down on rocky roads.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.407
Oh?

15:41.473 --> 15:43.976
So they need
to wear shoes.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.913
Fabulous!

15:47.980 --> 15:53.018
{\an5}NONNY:
And so the shoo-er gave the
royal horses brand new shoes.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.720
Thank you, shoo-er.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.288
Shoe-er!

15:56.355 --> 15:57.556
(Laughing)

15:57.623 --> 16:00.626
And they all lived
happily ever after.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.630
(All cheering)

16:04.697 --> 16:07.299

to get our tree.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.544
ALL:
Field trip!

17:58.610 --> 18:01.613
Do you want to come with us

Great! Come on.

Oh, you all picked
a very beautiful tree.

18:10.489 --> 18:14.193
Thank you, Mr. Claws.
Merry Christmas.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.794

18:15.861 --> 18:17.329
Good girl, Snowflake.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.097
She's pretty.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.767
Okay, guys.
Time to get going.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.236
Snow is really starting
to come down

18:24.303 --> 18:25.804
and we don't want
to get stuck.

18:25.871 --> 18:28.106
And Bubble Puppy

19:11.316 --> 19:13.585
What's wrong, Mr. Grouper?

19:13.652 --> 19:17.723
I think we're stuck in the snow.
It's gotten too deep.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.960
What are we going to do,
Mr. Grouper?

19:22.027 --> 19:26.431
We have to get home to Bubble
Puppy. He's all by himself!

19:26.498 --> 19:29.768
If we had a sled,
we could get back.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.738
Or a sleigh!

19:32.804 --> 19:34.773

beautiful.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.182
Okay. Merry Christmas.

21:24.249 --> 21:26.752

21:53.679 --> 21:56.548
That was a really fun
sleigh ride, huh, Gilly?

21:56.615 --> 21:59.451
Totally!
I love horses.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.087
Aw, there you are, Elmer.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.689
Good horsey.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.023
Uh, Gilly...

22:05.090 --> 22:06.992
Would you like
