00:01.839 --> 00:05.079
Anyone watching
thinking we know fuck all

00:05.176 --> 00:09.415
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back...

00:09.416 --> 00:12.035
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:12.075 --> 00:14.434
sending prices sky-high - literally...

00:14.435 --> 00:17.234
literally taking the grass
from its own roots!

00:17.235 --> 00:20.514
Now you've got your condemnation...

00:20.515 --> 00:24.314
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:24.315 --> 00:27.794
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.795 --> 00:31.674
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:31.763 --> 00:33.442
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.793 --> 00:38.032
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.872
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.873 --> 00:44.232
and they charge us for water?!

00:44.233 --> 00:48.952
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found,

00:48.953 --> 00:52.152
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:52.153 --> 00:55.232
yak-yak-yak-yak-yak
yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:55.233 --> 00:58.512
It's not theirs any more.

00:58.513 --> 01:01.032
This is our England now.

01:01.033 --> 01:03.512
Paaaarty!

01:09.033 --> 01:11.593
Depressing thought number 261.

01:12.953 --> 01:15.872
You can never truly know somebody.

01:15.873 --> 01:18.592
What they're really
thinking and feeling.

01:18.593 --> 01:21.952
No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be totally sure,

01:22.027 --> 01:23.466
never truly know.

01:23.467 --> 01:26.026
You'll always be strangers.

01:26.027 --> 01:28.946
Depressing thought number 262.

01:28.947 --> 01:31.146
You will never join that gym.

01:31.147 --> 01:33.026
You will never have a six pack.

01:33.027 --> 01:36.746
You will always feel a vague
sense of self-loathing

01:36.747 --> 01:38.946
every time you undress.

01:38.947 --> 01:41.946
Number 263.

01:41.947 --> 01:44.866
You will never be as young
as you are right now.

01:44.867 --> 01:47.026
See that moment that went by?

01:47.027 --> 01:50.586
That was it. S'gone.
And now you're older.

01:50.587 --> 01:51.987
You can never go back.

01:54.307 --> 01:55.907
Number 264.

01:59.827 --> 02:01.987
Everyone you know will die.

02:05.427 --> 02:08.827
Sometimes suddenly. Sometimes not.

02:11.667 --> 02:14.107
Sometimes they just slip away.

02:17.747 --> 02:20.867
And sometimes go out
in a blaze of glory.

02:23.067 --> 02:26.787
There will come a day when
you see them for the last time.

02:51.307 --> 02:54.226
You probably won't know it.

02:54.227 --> 02:57.466
No warning, no big fanfare.

02:57.467 --> 03:01.507
Just one day they'll be there,
and the next...

03:10.387 --> 03:11.507
gone.

03:13.707 --> 03:16.026
Right in front of me.

03:16.027 --> 03:18.946
Another inch, that could've
been me. Bang. Dead.

03:18.947 --> 03:21.146
Did you never learn
your Green Cross Code?

03:21.147 --> 03:22.866
Always look both ways.

03:22.867 --> 03:26.066
He was heading on in here as well.
That's lost revenue.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.426
It's a person we're talking
about here, Lillian,

03:28.427 --> 03:30.307
not some fucking number
on a spreadsheet.

03:30.308 --> 03:31.786
Eddie McGuinness. 35.

03:31.787 --> 03:34.386
Likes girls in
PVC and stockings.

03:34.387 --> 03:36.226
Have you anything to add to that?

03:36.227 --> 03:37.946
No.

03:37.947 --> 03:40.506
Well hush up
and drink your tea, then.

03:40.507 --> 03:42.226
Deep breaths.

03:42.227 --> 03:44.226
Yeah, s'just...

03:44.227 --> 03:47.306
makes you think, dunnit?
How fleeting life is.

03:47.307 --> 03:49.666
How you've got to make
the most of it.

03:49.667 --> 03:50.866
S'pose.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.306
Which is why...

03:52.307 --> 03:54.306
I've got something to ask you.

03:54.307 --> 03:55.427
Mmm...?

04:05.707 --> 04:08.307
Is there any chance
of another cup of tea?

04:44.667 --> 04:46.346
Don't worry. Not his wife.

04:46.347 --> 04:47.746
Just his sister.

04:47.747 --> 04:49.226
Oh, thank fuck.

04:49.227 --> 04:51.427
I thought for a minute
I was the other woman then.

04:51.428 --> 04:55.106
You're just another gullible tart
he'll barely remember
when he wakes up.

04:55.107 --> 04:57.066
Only difference between you

04:57.067 --> 05:01.466
and Kleenex is he probably
had to buy you a drink first.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.827
You can see yourself out.

05:20.947 --> 05:23.466
You are my sunshine...

05:23.467 --> 05:24.305
I'm your what?

05:24.306 --> 05:25.467
No, not you. SLUT!

05:25.468 --> 05:28.106
Oh, so I'm not your sunshine.
I'm just your slut.

05:28.107 --> 05:30.666
Shit. Sorry, no. I'm just a bit
all over the place here.

05:30.667 --> 05:34.586
I saw it, y'know. Milkman
vs postman. Fucking terrible.
Shook me up, it did.

05:34.587 --> 05:37.267
I had my chance, and I blew it.
Like a twat.

05:43.867 --> 05:44.907
He's up to summat.

05:44.908 --> 05:46.346
Who?

05:46.347 --> 05:49.786
Marty. He's got that look.
That matches, smoke and flame one.

05:49.787 --> 05:52.786
Nah. He's way past that, isn't he?

05:52.787 --> 05:54.027
He's in the toilet.

05:54.028 --> 05:56.946
Fucking hell, Karen.
Maybe he's having a piss.

05:56.947 --> 05:59.026
Best dial 999, shall we?

05:59.027 --> 06:02.226
Or maybe he's planning
his own personal bonfire night.

06:02.227 --> 06:05.466
So unless you want this place
burning down, again,

06:05.467 --> 06:07.267
get your arse into the gents.

06:12.427 --> 06:16.067
Kelly... you are my sunshine...

06:17.387 --> 06:19.466
my starlight...

06:19.467 --> 06:21.626
my...

06:21.627 --> 06:23.426
world...

06:23.427 --> 06:25.706
Will you do me the great honour
of being my...

06:25.707 --> 06:26.866
Shitflaps!

06:26.867 --> 06:29.267
Marty...! You all right
in there, mate?

06:30.787 --> 06:32.147
Marty!

06:36.267 --> 06:37.906
I've lost it.

06:37.907 --> 06:42.026
I've lost it, Jamie,
Jamie, I've lost it, I've lost it.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.987
I've lost it.

06:45.467 --> 06:48.466
"Miss you. Can't stop thinking
about you. Wish you were here.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.306
"Love you so much"?

06:50.307 --> 06:52.866
I mean, c'mon.
Pays 60 quid a pop,

06:52.867 --> 06:56.026
always comes on me tits and me face,
and he thinks that that's love?

06:56.027 --> 06:57.666
That's nice, dear, yeah.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.466
Then the dickhead only gets
me name tattooed on his arm.

07:01.467 --> 07:03.946
"Sherry". Sherry!

07:03.947 --> 07:06.227
It's not even my real name,
stupid twat...

07:12.907 --> 07:13.987
Hello?

07:15.347 --> 07:16.787
Girls...?

07:40.307 --> 07:43.627
Are you the spirit of Eddie,
that poor postie?

07:44.907 --> 07:46.307
I'm just a fucking dog, love.

07:46.308 --> 07:50.387
Now hurry up and open the letter.
Come on, darling.

07:55.467 --> 07:57.187
That doesn't spell romance to me,

07:57.188 --> 07:59.626
not when half of A&E
are sniggering at you.

07:59.627 --> 08:01.426
I've had one of my visions.

08:01.427 --> 08:02.466
What?

08:02.467 --> 08:04.026
Spirit world talking to me.

08:04.027 --> 08:05.586
A message from the other side.

08:05.587 --> 08:07.106
A warning.

08:07.107 --> 08:11.546
Like glass it will break,
a bond it will take.

08:11.547 --> 08:17.187
She will shed not a tear,
for a storm it draws near.

08:18.987 --> 08:20.827
Is that JLS?

08:25.507 --> 08:27.626
Lil... where you going?

08:27.627 --> 08:30.546
I need to spread the word
before disaster strikes.

08:30.547 --> 08:34.426
Also, we're out of batteries
for the dildos.

08:34.427 --> 08:37.466
When I woke up, I just knew
today was the day.

08:37.467 --> 08:40.466
And then I saw the postman get
splattered. It was like a sign.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.427
Yeah, a sign we're
getting a new postie.

08:42.428 --> 08:44.466
So what's flushing a ring
down the lavvy mean?

08:44.467 --> 08:46.106
It means I'm a fucking loser.

08:46.107 --> 08:48.266
It might still be in there, mate.

08:48.267 --> 08:50.346
The toilets are all backed up.
I've been meaning

08:50.347 --> 08:51.906
to get a plumber to sort it.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.426
I've got short arms.

08:53.427 --> 08:54.466
No way.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.746
Pleeease!

08:55.747 --> 08:57.386
I love her, Jamie. Fenian cunt!

08:57.387 --> 08:59.946
I just wanted it to be perfect.

08:59.947 --> 09:01.827
Like she is, but no,
I'm going to be alone

09:01.828 --> 09:05.266
cos I've got stupid
fucking short arms!

09:05.267 --> 09:09.107
You stupid bastard
short-arse fucking arms!

09:12.267 --> 09:13.267
Marty.

09:21.347 --> 09:22.827
Just give me a minute, yeah?

09:22.828 --> 09:24.147
Yeah.

09:26.267 --> 09:27.306
So?

09:27.307 --> 09:27.827
Don't ask.

09:27.828 --> 09:28.866
Jamie!

09:28.867 --> 09:31.267
Seriously, don't ask.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.226
Hero. God amongst men.

09:57.227 --> 09:59.466
I'd shake your hands, but...

09:59.467 --> 10:00.866
This never happened.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.187
Got the ring back!

10:02.747 --> 10:03.907
It's another sign.

10:03.908 --> 10:08.067
It means everything's going to work.
Everything's going to be OK.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.666
'So is two OK or not?'

10:12.667 --> 10:14.186
Listen, I'm willing to look at it,

10:14.187 --> 10:16.946
but I don't want any more of that
American "lite" piss, all right?

10:16.947 --> 10:18.466
'That's a yes, then.'

10:18.467 --> 10:21.386
I'd have more success
shifting me own urine.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.107
'Uh-oh, here comes the dirty talk.'

10:23.108 --> 10:25.827
Fine. Yeah, we'll talk
about it later, yeah?

10:28.067 --> 10:31.907
Fucking brewery. Still trying
to pass off that weak shit to us.

10:33.227 --> 10:34.586
I could go if you want.

10:34.587 --> 10:36.547
Nah. It's all right,
babes. No sweat.

10:37.947 --> 10:39.866
Great man you've got there, Karen.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.546
One of the good'uns.

10:41.547 --> 10:43.747
Love. Fucking love.

10:45.227 --> 10:46.666
It's amazing, innit?

10:46.667 --> 10:48.067
It's fucking amazing.

10:55.115 --> 10:59.034
I've got something
I need to ask you. About Kelly.

10:59.098 --> 11:01.817
I want to propose to her.

11:01.818 --> 11:04.777
And you've come here to
ask my permission?

11:04.778 --> 11:07.497
Well, it's not up to me
who that tart hooks up with.

11:07.498 --> 11:08.858
But you were married to her before.

11:08.859 --> 11:12.458
If she wants to choose a little creepy
pyro over me, it's her choice, innit?

11:12.459 --> 11:13.937
That's all in the past.

11:13.938 --> 11:16.257
What is the past, Marty?

11:16.258 --> 11:18.538
Some schools of thought
think that it doesn't exist.

11:18.539 --> 11:21.097
Everything happens concurrently.

11:21.098 --> 11:26.417
So while we're stood here, chatting,
there's another Marty,

11:26.418 --> 11:28.938
watching his wife
and kids burn to death.

11:31.218 --> 11:32.257
I'm sorry.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.577
Fuck off!

11:34.578 --> 11:36.857
That was way below the belt.

11:36.858 --> 11:39.697
Is that really what people think?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.817
That I killed Sue and the kids?

11:41.818 --> 11:44.938
Cos it wasn't like that.
I wasn't even there.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.898
Nobody thinks you did it.

11:51.498 --> 11:53.937
I was just being a dick.

11:53.938 --> 11:56.178
You did nick my wife after all.

12:01.058 --> 12:04.097
Should just get a taxi stand
outside the house,

12:04.098 --> 12:06.697
for all the gullible girls
he brings back home every night.

12:06.698 --> 12:09.777
Better than having to do
the walk of shame down Chatsworth.

12:09.778 --> 12:10.938
I need a favour.

12:10.939 --> 12:14.057
Does it involve cash?

12:14.058 --> 12:15.257
No.

12:15.258 --> 12:17.458
Then I'm listening.

12:18.818 --> 12:20.578
I need you to cover for me
at the Jockey.

12:20.579 --> 12:22.457
Yeah, course.

12:22.458 --> 12:25.258
Can you be there before two o'clock?

12:26.458 --> 12:30.457
Why? What's, what's happening at
two o'clock?

12:30.458 --> 12:33.097
I don't know. But Jamie does.
And I'm going to find out.

12:33.098 --> 12:34.978
Sorry, I'm not following you.

12:39.218 --> 12:42.217
He's got this text.
From "the brewery."

12:42.218 --> 12:46.177
It's got "xxx" at the end.

12:46.178 --> 12:47.657
That's nothing.

12:47.658 --> 12:50.457
I've been getting these feelings

12:50.458 --> 12:52.817
and they just keep building
and building.

12:52.818 --> 12:56.418
It's probably some dolly-bird who
works for the brewery, and just
texts like that.

12:58.338 --> 13:00.297
Look at me.

13:00.298 --> 13:01.858
Look at me!

13:06.138 --> 13:10.018
Jamie loves you.
Now stop doing this to yourself.

13:13.498 --> 13:15.057
Morning.

13:15.058 --> 13:17.977
Huh! It breathes, it walks,
but is it human?

13:17.978 --> 13:19.738
Barely.

13:20.938 --> 13:26.138
Two types of men in this world.
Men like my dearest brother...

13:27.338 --> 13:32.098
And then there's the rare
ones like your Jamie.

13:33.298 --> 13:34.698
The ones who are worth it.

14:04.338 --> 14:06.138
Idiot. Fuckin' stupid idiot.

14:15.178 --> 14:16.858
This isn't a spectator sport.

14:20.098 --> 14:24.097
I think I maybe need your help.
Spiritual guidance. That sort of
thing.

14:24.098 --> 14:28.538
God have mercy on your soul.
'Scuse me...

14:31.938 --> 14:34.657
Mirrors? Nah. Haven't broken any.

14:34.658 --> 14:37.617
Now you're sure?
The prophecy was quite specific.

14:37.618 --> 14:40.537
It's a prophecy now? Because
before it was just a message.

14:40.538 --> 14:44.777
Those of us who have the gift
are often mocked and shunned.

14:44.778 --> 14:46.978
Look, just if I was going to spend
the effort sending

14:46.979 --> 14:50.017
a message from the other side,
I'd make it coherent.

14:50.018 --> 14:51.696
Straight-forward. Not a shitty poem.

14:51.697 --> 14:52.658
20 menthol, Ches.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.537
You see? That's a message.

14:55.538 --> 14:58.017
No mistaking it. 20 menthol.

14:58.018 --> 15:01.097
None of this "for a storm
draws near" bollocks.

15:01.098 --> 15:03.298
- You had another one of your visions?
- A dog brung it.

15:06.098 --> 15:09.097
Didn't you also predict that
the world would end in 2009?

15:09.098 --> 15:12.778
A cat told me that one.
You can't trust them cats.

15:18.738 --> 15:22.897
Afternoon... oh er,
congratulations by the way. Marty.

15:22.898 --> 15:24.497
You not over that yet?

15:24.498 --> 15:26.217
No, I mean the...

15:26.218 --> 15:27.498
Y'know.

15:29.738 --> 15:31.537
Oh, bollocks.

15:31.538 --> 15:33.177
Shane.

15:33.178 --> 15:34.818
I said nothing, right?

15:47.258 --> 15:49.457
Right,
I'm off to see the brewery rep.

15:49.458 --> 15:50.818
See if you can get us
a bit of discount then?

15:50.819 --> 15:54.218
Yeah, I'll try and get pigs to fly
and hell freeze to over too.

15:55.658 --> 15:57.217
Is it a man or a woman?

15:57.218 --> 15:59.617
Who? The rep? He's a bloke. Why?

15:59.618 --> 16:02.137
Nothing, question. That's all.

16:02.138 --> 16:06.697
Come along if you want.
Should be gripping stuff.

16:06.698 --> 16:07.978
Nah. You're all right. OK.

16:10.498 --> 16:13.337
I've got the ring
and I've got the speech.

16:13.338 --> 16:16.018
But then I see her... I bottle it.

16:17.818 --> 16:20.537
You're a priest. You must have
married loads of people...

16:20.538 --> 16:23.057
Ah. I see. So you're asking me

16:23.058 --> 16:26.097
if I think that you
and Kelly are right for each other?

16:26.098 --> 16:29.377
No. You can't make her happy, Marty.

16:29.378 --> 16:32.857
Chances are, she'll turn you down,
or she'll run off before the wedding
happens,

16:32.858 --> 16:34.457
or a month or two down the line

16:34.458 --> 16:37.257
you'll go home and see a lipstick
message on the mirror.

16:37.258 --> 16:38.456
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote.

16:38.457 --> 16:39.938
I thought priests were meant

16:39.939 --> 16:42.337
to make people feel better about
themselves.

16:42.338 --> 16:43.778
Look at you, Marty. Look at her.

16:43.779 --> 16:46.377
Imagine the things that she's done
to make her money.

16:46.378 --> 16:48.377
The men she's held in her arms,

16:48.378 --> 16:51.737
kissed, fucked, sucked,

16:51.738 --> 16:54.897
and then ask yourself, why, y'know,
why in all that's holy,

16:54.898 --> 16:59.257
would she choose you? Why would she
choose little twitchin' stutterin'
Marty Fisher?

16:59.258 --> 17:02.257
Fuckin' twat!

17:02.258 --> 17:03.098
Marty - eh!

17:03.099 --> 17:04.416
Good lad.

17:04.417 --> 17:05.656
What?

17:05.657 --> 17:08.817
You don't give a shit what anyone
thinks, not me, your family
or friends.

17:08.818 --> 17:12.337
It's not about us. It's about you.
And her. That's all.

17:12.338 --> 17:14.057
Do you love her?

17:14.058 --> 17:16.297
And does she love you?

17:16.298 --> 17:20.098
Then that's it. You ask her.
Ask her to marry you.

17:24.578 --> 17:25.858
And buy me another drink.

17:25.858 --> 17:28.057
Actually do that first,
you know - priorities.

17:28.058 --> 17:30.057
Will you do our wedding?

17:30.058 --> 17:33.738
Make it a double whisky and I'll
throw in some tap dancing as well.

17:37.058 --> 17:38.378
What's wrong with you today?

17:38.379 --> 17:41.418
Sorry.
Can I get a big whisky please?

17:48.778 --> 17:49.818
You alone?

17:59.338 --> 18:00.977
We've got to be more careful.

18:00.978 --> 18:02.377
Yeah, we will be.

18:02.378 --> 18:05.257
Look, you know the rules.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.938
And I get it,
it's not easy for you sometimes...

18:06.939 --> 18:08.057
Sorry?

18:08.058 --> 18:12.137
It's just I've got the wife and the
kid and you're sort of stuck here
alone, aren't you?

18:12.138 --> 18:13.817
What? You feeling sorry for me...?

18:13.818 --> 18:17.137
No, I just I didn't mean
it like that. I mean...

18:17.138 --> 18:18.497
I understand you.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.538
You're such a great guy!

18:36.538 --> 18:38.217
Have you broken any mirrors...?

18:38.218 --> 18:42.898
What? Look, I'm busy,
middle of a complex perm.

18:44.138 --> 18:47.497
See, I've had this vision, and I'm
asking everybody, it's important.

18:47.498 --> 18:50.337
Well, I've had this vision too,
Lillian.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.977
Your nose is bleeding
and my knuckles are sore.

18:52.978 --> 18:54.656
You want to find out how it happens?

18:54.657 --> 18:56.138
I'm only trying to save some souls.

18:56.139 --> 18:57.258
Bye.

19:04.138 --> 19:08.217
"My sunshine, my starlight,
my world." What do you think?

19:08.218 --> 19:11.898
Is sunshine better first?
Or starlight?

19:13.778 --> 19:16.697
I think any woman who won't marry
you because you put

19:16.698 --> 19:18.178
one in front of the other,
isn't worth marrying, Marty.

19:18.179 --> 19:20.298
I just want it to be right.

19:22.338 --> 19:23.738
Well, now's your chance.

19:25.218 --> 19:27.858
Shit. I can't do it,
not here, not now.

19:30.178 --> 19:31.336
Kelly. How are you?

19:31.337 --> 19:32.658
Something you want to tell me?

19:32.659 --> 19:35.178
No. Don't think so.

19:36.298 --> 19:37.698
You're sure?

19:38.818 --> 19:41.217
Do you... want a drink?

19:41.218 --> 19:43.938
How about, "Do you want to marry
me?"

19:45.418 --> 19:46.897
Yeah, I know about it.

19:46.898 --> 19:48.737
You've been avoiding me all day.

19:48.738 --> 19:50.977
That's right, ninja-boy,
I saw you hiding.

19:50.978 --> 19:53.737
So what is it?

19:53.738 --> 19:57.657
Cold feet?
Think I'm not good enough for you?

19:57.658 --> 20:00.737
No, fuck, no. I just...

20:00.738 --> 20:05.137
I wanted everything to be
hearts and flowers,

20:05.138 --> 20:07.057
perfect moment. Just for you.

20:07.058 --> 20:13.898
It's life, Marty. There's no such
thing as the perfect moment.

20:15.938 --> 20:17.257
Go on then.

20:17.258 --> 20:21.258
What, here now?

20:35.673 --> 20:37.932
Kelly Ball. You are my sun...

20:38.023 --> 20:39.062
Yes.

20:39.284 --> 20:41.403
What?

20:41.404 --> 20:42.724
Yes!

21:08.379 --> 21:11.617
- I hope you're as happy as me and Mimi are.
- I tell you what, that woman...

21:11.751 --> 21:13.510
You're about to do it
again, aren't you?

21:13.511 --> 21:14.030
What...?

21:14.031 --> 21:15.672
You know, start talking
about me mam,

21:15.673 --> 21:18.592
tell me how fantastic in bed she is.
Let me save you some time, eh?

21:20.512 --> 21:21.791
He's in love.

21:21.792 --> 21:24.591
And love is the most important
thing in the world.

21:24.592 --> 21:27.151
There's only thing I want to know.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.592
I promise you. I'll love her,
cherish her, honour her...

21:29.593 --> 21:32.671
Nah, nah, nah, nah. Are we going
to have a party tonight or not?

21:32.672 --> 21:33.952
Party!

21:36.272 --> 21:38.711
She said yes, then?

21:38.712 --> 21:42.471
I want your best champagne.
And banners, streamers, the works.

21:42.472 --> 21:43.670
Nothing's too good for my girl.

21:43.671 --> 21:45.390
Dunno about the streamers
and banners

21:45.391 --> 21:47.712
but we can stick up the Christmas
decorations if you like...

21:47.713 --> 21:51.191
Brilliant! Everyone loves Christmas!

21:51.192 --> 21:53.551
Better change into
me party dress then!

21:53.552 --> 21:54.871
You're back early.

21:54.872 --> 21:56.991
Yeah, I got halfway
there and the twat phones

21:56.992 --> 22:00.392
to say he couldn't make
it today. Cheers for that.

22:03.392 --> 22:04.991
You all right?

22:04.992 --> 22:06.631
Yeah.

22:06.632 --> 22:08.032
Never better.

22:11.272 --> 22:13.351
Wait, Kel!

22:13.352 --> 22:16.471
It's all right, I meant it. I'm home
to change, not running out on you.

22:16.472 --> 22:17.632
No. It's about the ring.

22:17.633 --> 22:19.352
It was my grandmother's...

22:20.592 --> 22:22.231
but it was Sue's as well.

22:22.232 --> 22:24.671
She chucked it at me
when we split up.

22:24.672 --> 22:26.952
And I kept it because
I wanted to give it to someone

22:26.953 --> 22:29.791
who truly deserved it.
You see, my nan and grandad,

22:29.792 --> 22:32.511
they were together
till they died...

22:32.512 --> 22:34.711
You're telling me
you've used this ring before?

22:34.712 --> 22:37.672
Proposal, marriage, the whole thing?

22:40.032 --> 22:43.111
I'll buy you a different one if
you give me time to get the money,

22:43.112 --> 22:45.192
I'll get you the biggest,
brightest diamond I can afford...

22:45.193 --> 22:46.432
It's romantic.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.711
What?

22:49.712 --> 22:53.751
You want me to have this
for the right reasons.

22:53.752 --> 22:55.991
I get it.

22:55.992 --> 22:59.191
It's...

22:59.192 --> 23:00.791
romantic.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.072
I know.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.432
It's like Beauty And The Beast.

23:10.433 --> 23:12.591
If the Beast had a thing
for torching houses

23:12.592 --> 23:13.830
and shouting "wanker!"

23:13.831 --> 23:16.230
They just seem a bit wrong
for each other, don't they?

23:16.231 --> 23:17.672
Not like me and you, babe.

23:17.673 --> 23:21.431
She's had more cocks than
Bernard Matthews. Good luck to him.

23:21.432 --> 23:22.991
Oh, for fuck's sake!

23:22.992 --> 23:24.672
Can't you just be happy for them?

23:25.712 --> 23:28.471
Don't you dare fall on me.

23:28.472 --> 23:29.752
I'll do my best.

23:36.032 --> 23:37.911
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

23:37.912 --> 23:39.631
What?

23:39.632 --> 23:44.752
- I said, do you think I'm fucking stupid?
- What the fuck has gotten into you?

23:44.753 --> 23:45.911
You.

23:45.912 --> 23:48.192
Getting into my fucking husband.

23:49.352 --> 23:51.391
Me and Jamie?

23:51.392 --> 23:52.952
Are you crazy?

23:56.072 --> 23:57.751
I don't know.

23:57.752 --> 24:01.551
Something isn't right
and it's driving me mad.

24:01.552 --> 24:03.671
And I don't know...

24:03.672 --> 24:05.631
what is worse.

24:05.632 --> 24:08.871
If it's true...

24:08.872 --> 24:10.311
or if...

24:10.312 --> 24:12.712
or if it's all in your head?

24:17.112 --> 24:18.631
OK.

24:18.632 --> 24:21.391
So, one way or another...

24:21.392 --> 24:22.672
we will find out.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.551
Well, someone must have
broken a mirror.

24:28.552 --> 24:31.071
And as I've told you before,
it's none of us.

24:31.072 --> 24:31.832
But my vision...

24:31.833 --> 24:34.151
Overactive imagination.

24:34.152 --> 24:35.631
I have the gift.

24:35.632 --> 24:38.591
You should take it back
to the shop, then.

24:38.592 --> 24:41.631
Respect for your elders and betters.

24:41.632 --> 24:44.751
The boy's right. I'd hang
onto the receipt if I were you.

24:44.752 --> 24:46.632
Damaged goods.

24:49.272 --> 24:52.352
You're not going
to fuck this one up, Kel.

24:54.512 --> 24:56.672
You're not
going to fuck it up, right?

25:08.632 --> 25:10.792
Princess Kate, in the house.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.031
You look... very passable, dear.

25:15.032 --> 25:17.351
Thank you.

25:17.352 --> 25:19.791
More importantly,
this party of yours tonight.

25:19.792 --> 25:24.871
I am right in understanding there
will be free beverages available?

25:24.872 --> 25:27.831
Only because I want
all the drinking, drugs, fucking

25:27.832 --> 25:31.071
and fighting out of the way tonight.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.471
I am having a proper wedding.

25:33.472 --> 25:36.031
I don't want anybody
wiping blood and vomit off the pews.

25:36.032 --> 25:38.032
You're getting married
in a... a church?

25:40.992 --> 25:46.151
Well, they do say
the Lord is very forgiving,

25:46.152 --> 25:48.192
even of the blackest of sheep.

25:49.472 --> 25:50.551
Bin.

25:50.552 --> 25:51.432
What's happened to these?

25:51.433 --> 25:52.711
Pah!

25:52.712 --> 25:55.432
Vernon Francis Gallagher happened.

26:00.312 --> 26:03.511
Every one bill that
comes through the door now.

26:03.512 --> 26:05.111
Says he's fighting the system.

26:05.112 --> 26:06.591
This isn't a bill.

26:06.592 --> 26:08.032
It's for your Marty.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.792
Err, you can't do that!

26:12.272 --> 26:16.071
That little sponger
gets his post sent here.

26:16.072 --> 26:18.272
It's fair game.

26:23.032 --> 26:24.591
What?

26:24.592 --> 26:28.152
This... is from one of Marty's kids.

26:39.392 --> 26:42.872
Get Jamie alone and then
make a move on him.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.991
It's not rocket science.

26:45.992 --> 26:47.791
Look, I would do this, OK?

26:47.792 --> 26:50.311
But I am related and I think
it would just creep him out.

26:50.312 --> 26:53.231
Karen, I thought we sorted this out.

26:53.232 --> 26:55.272
It's just this little voice
in my head, yapping away...

26:55.273 --> 26:58.151
Get a grip and tell it to fuck off.

26:58.152 --> 27:00.071
Please.

27:00.072 --> 27:02.152
I need to be sure.

27:05.512 --> 27:06.712
Marriage isn't easy.

27:06.713 --> 27:09.431
It's about compromise,
it's about trust,

27:09.432 --> 27:12.311
it's about suppressing things,
knowing you can't always be right,

27:12.312 --> 27:13.751
even when you are.

27:13.752 --> 27:16.391
People say it's
a rollercoaster, but...

27:16.392 --> 27:18.271
it's more of a ghost train.

27:18.272 --> 27:19.791
But it's good, right?

27:19.792 --> 27:22.432
You wouldn't change it for the world?

27:23.632 --> 27:25.551
Welcome to the club.

27:25.552 --> 27:27.951
There you go, love.

27:27.952 --> 27:29.232
Thank you.

27:34.032 --> 27:35.911
All right?

27:35.912 --> 27:37.191
Karen knows.

27:37.192 --> 27:38.351
What?

27:38.352 --> 27:40.671
Or, at least,
she suspects. Something.

27:40.672 --> 27:42.871
She sent me in here to test you.

27:42.872 --> 27:44.032
You're kidding me.

27:44.033 --> 27:45.232
No, Jamie.

27:46.352 --> 27:49.911
Right, so, you go back out there,
you tell her what a good boy I am...

27:49.912 --> 27:52.391
and it's business as usual, yeah?

27:52.392 --> 27:55.111
How do you think
this makes me feel...?

27:55.112 --> 27:57.191
Hey. Like I told
you before, I understand.

27:57.192 --> 27:59.631
It's not easy for you.

27:59.632 --> 28:04.391
So we'll be more careful
in future, right?

28:04.392 --> 28:05.912
Now, go on.

28:17.752 --> 28:18.912
So...?

28:20.272 --> 28:23.111
Seriously, you've
got nothing to worry about.

28:23.112 --> 28:26.192
Like I said, you've got
a good man there.

28:30.112 --> 28:33.351
It just says his kid's
been looking for him.

28:33.352 --> 28:35.791
Most of it's all burnt,
but there's...

28:35.792 --> 28:37.671
an address in Spain...

28:37.672 --> 28:39.631
It just doesn't make sense.

28:39.632 --> 28:41.591
You have to show him the letter.

28:41.592 --> 28:43.271
What if it means...

28:43.272 --> 28:44.791
His wife, his kids...

28:44.792 --> 28:46.151
They're all still alive?

28:46.152 --> 28:49.271
Marty would still want
to be with you.

28:49.272 --> 28:51.471
No matter what.

28:51.472 --> 28:54.392
Unless, of course...

28:56.992 --> 28:59.031
"Unless, of course..." what?

28:59.032 --> 29:02.191
It just seems strange
he said they were all dead.

29:02.192 --> 29:04.111
His wife. His two little children.

29:04.112 --> 29:06.511
I'm sure that's what he believed.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.551
At least, I hope it is.

29:08.552 --> 29:09.992
Because if he lied about this,

29:09.993 --> 29:14.071
then God knows what other
dirty secrets he has tucked away.

29:14.072 --> 29:17.831
But I'm sure
it's all an honest mistake.

29:17.832 --> 29:19.552
It happens all the time.

29:20.792 --> 29:24.511
"Where are your wife and kids, Jim?"
"They're dead."

29:24.512 --> 29:27.231
"Oh, wait. No, they're not.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.352
"They're in Sainsbury's,
doing the shopping."

29:34.712 --> 29:37.631
And there'll be someone
out there for you too.

29:37.632 --> 29:41.271
Of course there is! There's
a fucking busload if she wants it.

29:41.272 --> 29:44.711
Traffic jams up and down the M60,
tits and arse like that.

29:44.712 --> 29:47.111
No... I just meant, the one.

29:47.112 --> 29:49.111
That's such bollocks!

29:49.112 --> 29:51.632
There's no such thing as "the one."

29:53.192 --> 29:55.751
Oh, go suck a Fisherman's Friend.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.192
Well, I think it's very sweet.
Because the view from here

29:58.193 --> 30:00.431
is usually a sea
of glum and tormented faces,

30:00.432 --> 30:02.432
so it's very nice to see a smile.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.632
Wedding's off.

30:08.872 --> 30:10.072
Kel? What's going on?
What's happened?

30:10.073 --> 30:11.631
Your fucking kid, Marty.

30:11.632 --> 30:13.231
You lied.

30:13.232 --> 30:15.471
Sympathy, was it?

30:15.472 --> 30:18.432
"Aw, they died in that fire."
Poor fucking Marty.

30:19.752 --> 30:20.832
Don't fucking touch me.

30:22.032 --> 30:24.551
Don't fucking look at me.

30:24.552 --> 30:27.792
And don't ever
fucking talk to me again.

30:32.192 --> 30:33.352
Kelly?

30:39.432 --> 30:40.752
Marty?

30:43.352 --> 30:44.552
Marty?

30:46.152 --> 30:48.752
You all right, mate?

31:01.072 --> 31:03.151
Lillian here?

31:03.152 --> 31:04.791
She's out on her mission.

31:04.792 --> 31:05.672
You know, the gift.

31:05.673 --> 31:07.191
Doesn't matter. I'm back.

31:07.192 --> 31:08.510
Next customer's mine, all right?

31:08.511 --> 31:09.432
There's a rota.

31:09.433 --> 31:12.232
- Fuck the rota.
- You can't just come and
steal punters off the rest of us...

31:12.233 --> 31:14.951
I'm fucking working.
So get the fuck out of my way.

31:14.952 --> 31:16.992
Sorry, Kel. Just business.

31:18.952 --> 31:20.312
Slag.

31:21.792 --> 31:22.992
Marty?

31:24.312 --> 31:26.032
Hello?

31:28.032 --> 31:30.232
He's gone.

31:38.712 --> 31:41.032
Fuck. Miles away.

31:42.193 --> 31:45.912
Maybe the lad just needs
some spiritual guidance?

31:45.913 --> 31:47.992
I learnt this one in the seminary.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.873
It's the short, sharp shock.

31:52.052 --> 31:53.052
Ooh, Jesus.

31:56.012 --> 31:57.971
Snakes with fucking tits.

31:58.910 --> 32:01.150
And we're back.

32:08.954 --> 32:10.093
Thank you.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.993
So what does it say?

32:13.062 --> 32:14.902
Last month. From Spain.

32:16.182 --> 32:18.941
It's got a return address
and everything.

32:18.942 --> 32:20.141
I don't know what to do.

32:20.145 --> 32:22.425
Most folk will tell you
the right thing to do is jump on

32:22.426 --> 32:25.584
the next plane and head over there.
But there's no way of knowing.

32:25.585 --> 32:27.785
It could have been to
tell you to stay the hell away,

32:27.786 --> 32:30.144
no matter what.

32:31.269 --> 32:33.428
Not like the Good Book offers
much help.

32:33.429 --> 32:36.788
Even the big man upstairs
more or less abandoned his kid,

32:36.789 --> 32:38.689
at least until
the Romans started hammering nails

32:38.726 --> 32:40.604
into his hands and feet.

32:40.605 --> 32:43.684
This idea that we're supposed
to be there for our kids,

32:43.685 --> 32:46.324
that we're needed, even nature
thinks it's bollocks,

32:46.325 --> 32:49.604
the number of animals who kick their
brood out to fend for themselves...

32:49.605 --> 32:53.484
At the end of the day, you've
got to ask yourself one question...

32:53.485 --> 32:56.125
are you doing more damage than good?

32:57.526 --> 32:59.645
Come on. Casting out pearls here.

32:59.646 --> 33:02.845
If you're going to switch off,
that's fine, but let me know.

33:02.846 --> 33:04.885
I'm not a bloody jukebox.

33:04.886 --> 33:07.085
Everything's out of my control.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.525
I want it to burn.

33:09.526 --> 33:11.565
This place.

33:11.566 --> 33:13.926
The estate. You. Everyone.

33:15.166 --> 33:16.726
I need to be stopped.

33:23.398 --> 33:25.237
2.50...

33:25.238 --> 33:27.557
Eh...

33:27.558 --> 33:30.517
Don't look now, but erm...

33:30.518 --> 33:33.677
I think Gloria just made
a move on me in the back room.

33:33.743 --> 33:35.062
Really...?

33:35.063 --> 33:37.222
Yeah, I know she's your mate
and all that...

33:37.223 --> 33:39.102
I'll have a word with her.

33:39.103 --> 33:42.182
Just... don't go too
hard on her, eh?

33:42.183 --> 33:44.103
She seems a bit lonely.

33:58.342 --> 33:59.541
What?

33:59.542 --> 34:01.621
I said "nice one"...

34:01.622 --> 34:03.261
on the engagement.

34:03.262 --> 34:04.942
Put it there, mate.

34:08.382 --> 34:09.982
Can I have, uh...?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.701
Headache, eh?
All that excitement.

34:15.702 --> 34:17.262
No, I meant...

34:25.262 --> 34:27.541
Is it all right if I use
your toilet?

34:27.542 --> 34:30.460
Normally, no, but seeing
as today's your special day...

34:30.462 --> 34:32.181
Go on. Here you are.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.581
Just don't leave a mess.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.462
You don't know what it's like,
up here.

34:48.621 --> 34:50.420
The fucking grind.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.420
Day after day, it's never ending.

34:53.422 --> 34:55.222
I actually envy you.

34:57.942 --> 34:59.422
Is that bad?

35:03.622 --> 35:06.381
It's not bad.

35:06.382 --> 35:09.022
Fucking stupid, though.

35:11.902 --> 35:14.621
Recommended dose, two.

35:14.622 --> 35:16.742
Fuck you, recommended dose.

35:25.542 --> 35:28.862
Fuck. No. Fuck.

36:07.422 --> 36:09.541
So, you've come to gloat then?

36:09.542 --> 36:11.181
Nah, not my style, to be honest.

36:11.182 --> 36:12.542
Totally your style.

36:15.182 --> 36:17.061
Don't fuck this up.

36:17.062 --> 36:18.581
He lied to me.

36:18.582 --> 36:19.902
He worships you.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.661
I saw his face Kel
when you broke the news.

36:24.662 --> 36:26.461
Poor bastard didn't have a clue.

36:26.462 --> 36:28.501
He thought they were dead
too, you know.

36:28.502 --> 36:31.062
Why are you sticking up for him?

36:35.062 --> 36:36.582
Because I love you.

36:43.782 --> 36:46.621
Fuck's sake.

36:46.622 --> 36:48.261
We can try again.

36:48.262 --> 36:50.541
You don't want that.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.422
You want to get fucked up...

36:54.782 --> 36:57.981
and ruin everything,

36:57.982 --> 37:00.542
like you always do.

37:02.102 --> 37:04.061
I thought you'd changed, you know.

37:04.062 --> 37:05.501
Because of Marty.

37:05.502 --> 37:07.381
I have.

37:07.382 --> 37:09.061
Bollocks.

37:09.062 --> 37:10.502
No, I have.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.421
Tell you what, fuck it,
let's do it.

37:14.422 --> 37:17.861
Right here, next to the old
memorial tree.

37:17.862 --> 37:20.341
That'll show everyone, won't it?

37:20.342 --> 37:23.221
All right...

37:23.222 --> 37:24.542
You've made your point.

37:27.822 --> 37:29.781
Good...

37:29.782 --> 37:32.422
Won't say no
to a hand-job though.

37:43.742 --> 37:45.502
One in a million, your mam.

37:48.542 --> 37:49.862
One in a million.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.021
Hey, are you OK?

37:58.022 --> 38:01.181
I was just going to take all
the paracetamol at once. Overdose.

38:01.182 --> 38:05.221
Just finish it here and now.
I dropped them down the toilet.

38:05.222 --> 38:07.021
Clumsy twat, butterfingers!

38:07.022 --> 38:10.541
Wait, I was going to walk in
your body, selfish twat more like.

38:10.542 --> 38:13.741
You know why I used to burn things?
I wanted a measure of control,

38:13.742 --> 38:15.301
you know, to be responsible.

38:15.302 --> 38:19.341
But I was wrong because the world
is chaotic and unpredictable and...

38:19.342 --> 38:20.461
stupid...

38:20.462 --> 38:22.941
and that's why it's beautiful.

38:22.942 --> 38:24.421
All right, all right.

38:24.422 --> 38:27.301
When I saw the postie get hit
by the milk van, I thought...

38:27.302 --> 38:30.301
I thought it was a sign, for me
to move things forward,

38:30.302 --> 38:32.861
to make the most of time,
but it wasn't.

38:32.862 --> 38:35.701
It was a sign to embrace the chaos.

38:35.702 --> 38:37.622
Mate, I'm pretty sure
it was neither.

38:37.623 --> 38:40.981
Just one poor bastard getting hit
by another poor bastard.

38:40.982 --> 38:42.782
You know what?

38:44.182 --> 38:45.782
You're probably right.

38:50.182 --> 38:53.462
Marty? You still owe us
for the paracetamol.

38:55.422 --> 38:56.941
Wait...

38:56.942 --> 38:58.222
Fuck it, fuck it.

38:59.702 --> 39:01.621
Wedding present...

39:01.622 --> 39:03.462
on the house.

39:21.182 --> 39:22.702
Listen Marty...

39:28.782 --> 39:30.222
Give me your hand.

39:31.382 --> 39:34.061
I am not letting you get
away from me.

39:34.062 --> 39:37.302
I love you, Kelly,
and you love me.

39:39.142 --> 39:42.181
And that's why your bag's packed?

39:42.182 --> 39:44.861
That's why you're going, right?

39:44.862 --> 39:47.901
My son could still be alive.

39:47.902 --> 39:50.182
I have to find out what happened.

39:51.302 --> 39:52.341
Wrong finger.

39:52.342 --> 39:53.502
What?

39:55.262 --> 39:58.502
Engagement ring... You put it on my
right finger, right is wrong.

40:00.062 --> 40:01.381
Bollocks.

40:01.382 --> 40:02.942
And, we've got
the engagement party...

40:02.943 --> 40:04.661
I'll be back.

40:04.662 --> 40:06.262
Just wait one more day!

40:12.142 --> 40:14.102
I don't want you to go, Marty.

40:16.742 --> 40:18.302
I was so scared...

40:21.422 --> 40:23.342
scared of being hurt by you

40:27.142 --> 40:28.502
but I want it.

40:30.342 --> 40:32.301
To be hurt, to be happy, to be...

40:32.302 --> 40:35.022
To be everything with you.

40:37.582 --> 40:40.182
I'll be back. You know that, right?

40:42.502 --> 40:44.301
It's a promise.

40:44.302 --> 40:46.142
I'll be back.

41:05.742 --> 41:08.101
A little early for Halloween.

41:08.102 --> 41:10.141
I'm taking you
to your engagement party.

41:10.142 --> 41:13.621
That's not going to happen. If you
think I'm going in there alone.

41:13.622 --> 41:16.302
Argh!

41:20.062 --> 41:22.861
That is what your self pity
sounds like to me.

41:22.862 --> 41:24.301
Honest to God.

41:24.302 --> 41:27.141
That boy Marty loves you
and you love him

41:27.142 --> 41:30.141
and everyone here knows
he would shift heaven and earth

41:30.142 --> 41:31.461
to come back to you

41:31.462 --> 41:36.462
and if that is not a cause for
celebration, I don't know what is.

41:51.582 --> 41:53.182
Don't let me get too drunk, eh?

41:57.382 --> 42:00.822
Thank Christ! The thought of missing
a free bar.

42:06.862 --> 42:08.621
I don't understand.

42:08.622 --> 42:10.221
I've got the gift.

42:10.222 --> 42:11.981
I got the warning.

42:11.982 --> 42:14.861
But poor Kelly and Marty
still got heart-broken.

42:14.862 --> 42:16.901
It weren't for them, you daft cow.

42:16.902 --> 42:19.661
It was for the other couple.
You were meant to save them.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.061
What, the black ones?

42:21.062 --> 42:22.982
The good looking fella
and his wife.

42:22.983 --> 42:27.701
No, Frank and Patty aren't a couple,
they just share a house.

42:27.702 --> 42:29.221
You silly dog.

42:29.222 --> 42:31.542
You stupid cow.

42:32.942 --> 42:35.382
See you next year, love.
