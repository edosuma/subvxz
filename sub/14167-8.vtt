about the fight, I think.

in front of the door,

- Good.

40:45.862 --> 40:48.330
Yeah, it went good. I, uh...

Well, I mean, she doesn't want anything,

41:08.317 --> 41:10.351
and I think we're just
gonna get a mediator.

41:13.389 --> 41:15.190
I don't know what else to say.

She doesn't want any money.
We're gonna get a divorce.

She doesn't want anything
to do with the gym.

Why do you have a
fucking problem with this?

41:32.808 --> 41:35.442
I don't know. Maybe because
you just felt the need

41:35.476 --> 41:37.344
to tell me that she's your wife.

41:37.378 --> 41:40.014

the driveway for 20 minutes.

Huh.

She said that, um,

42:28.629 --> 42:31.096
you should sign over
the deed to the gym to me

42:31.131 --> 42:33.699

42:40.206 --> 42:41.573
You know what you could do?

42:41.607 --> 42:43.475
You could tell your little lawyer friend

42:43.509 --> 42:45.911
that, in a million years,
I wouldn't sign my gym over

42:45.945 --> 42:48.480
to you or anybody else, for that matter.

- No, I get it.

42:50.817 --> 42:52.951
Right. You don't trust me.

I trust you. Although, I don't
know why I should trust you.

does that mean? What...

your money back, sweetheart?

back. My money back?
