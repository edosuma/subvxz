WEBVTT

00:03.786 --> 00:05.396
Bob Evans? Al Ruddy.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.745
I wanted to talk to you.
You got a minute?

00:06.789 --> 00:08.182
What can I do for you,
Mr. Ruddy?

00:08.225 --> 00:09.487
It's what I can do for you.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.228
I want to produce
for Paramount.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.708
"The Godfather."

00:12.751 --> 00:15.711
It's 58 weeks at number one.
Makes us looks stupid.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.321
And that's bad for business.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.062
Buddy, you've read
"The Godfather", right?

00:19.106 --> 00:20.803
I need you to produce it.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.631
The Corleones are my family.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.459
I have to be the one
to write this.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.069
Puzo's never written a film.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.375
It's an unwritten law
in Hollywood

00:27.418 --> 00:28.811
that you never hire
the author.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.378
I can't do this.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.075
Evans warned you
about hiring the novelist.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.208
So how do we fix it?

00:34.251 --> 00:35.948
Francis Ford Coppola.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.863
He's brilliant,
but he'll want to direct.

00:37.907 --> 00:41.650
Jews got the JDL.
The Blacks got the NAACP.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.260
Well, who defends us,
the Italians?

00:43.304 --> 00:45.349
Nobody.Well, I'm starting.

00:45.393 --> 00:48.091
The Italian-American
Civil Rights League.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.832
You're the rat fink
who wrote that fucking book

00:49.875 --> 00:51.355
about the degenerate singer.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.836
Sinatra wants us
to shut the picture down.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.490
Get me Mickey Cohen
in Los Angeles.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.275
Time to send a message.

02:25.797 --> 02:29.149
One! One! One! One!

02:29.192 --> 02:31.281
One! One! One!
One!

02:31.325 --> 02:35.416
There's a conspiracy
in this country...

02:35.459 --> 02:37.374
against Italian-Americans!

02:38.984 --> 02:40.638
The President,

02:40.682 --> 02:42.031
the Vice-President,

02:42.074 --> 02:43.467
the Attorney General,

02:43.511 --> 02:44.729
all conspiring against

02:44.773 --> 02:46.601
the hard-working
Italian people.

02:46.644 --> 02:49.299
- Yeah!
- We must unite!

02:52.563 --> 02:54.478
And the media,

02:54.522 --> 02:56.828
they carry the water

02:56.872 --> 02:58.830
for the corrupt politicians
in the government

02:58.874 --> 03:00.571
that tries to hold us down!

03:00.615 --> 03:02.660
Give me the book.

03:03.748 --> 03:06.055
And books like this trash

03:06.098 --> 03:09.972
only fuel the fire of hatred
for our people.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.235
And now the papers say
they're making a movie of it.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.108
This, my friends,
is a book of lies,

03:16.152 --> 03:18.328
and Mario Puzo is a traitor!

03:21.026 --> 03:24.378
Well, my friends,
this stops today!

03:24.421 --> 03:28.208
Our organization,
your organization,

03:28.251 --> 03:31.515
the Italian-American Civil
Rights League will fight back.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.344
We will snuff out the hatred
and the prejudice!

03:40.872 --> 03:42.831
Columbo, Columbo!

03:52.319 --> 03:54.103
Hey, boys.
Can I help you?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.714
Is this your car?
You Al Ruddy?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.542
Yeah, that's me.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.283
FBI.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.720
I'm Agent Hale,
this is Special Agent Moran.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.069
FBI?

04:04.113 --> 04:05.375
And, uh, and you are?

04:06.507 --> 04:09.684
Bettye McCartt.
Mr. Ruddy's secretary.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.555
Oh, right.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.296
So you were in the car
last night as well?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.255
That's right, yeah.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.604
Look, what's this all about?

04:16.647 --> 04:18.867
I already gave
a statement to the LAPD.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.434
So what are you guys
doing here?

04:22.218 --> 04:24.002
Well, we have reasons
to believe

04:24.046 --> 04:26.440
that you may have been targeted
by Mickey Cohen.

04:26.483 --> 04:27.876
The gangster?

04:27.919 --> 04:29.225
Can you think of
any reason

04:29.269 --> 04:32.663
why Cohen might have wanted
to scare you?

04:32.707 --> 04:34.883
Now, think real hard, hmm?

04:34.926 --> 04:36.754
Maybe something to do
with your business?

04:36.798 --> 04:38.103
Your personal life? Huh?

04:38.147 --> 04:39.061
Scare us?

04:41.019 --> 04:42.586
He tried to kill us.

04:42.630 --> 04:43.848
No.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.068
That was a warning.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.026
When Mickey Cohen
fires a shot...

04:50.333 --> 04:52.074
He doesn't miss.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.468
Is there a reason why you
guys are here right now with us

04:54.511 --> 04:55.991
and not arresting him?Again...

04:57.122 --> 04:58.559
Just a suspicion.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.779
How fucking comforting.

05:10.745 --> 05:14.575
It's not about murder,
it's about family.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.882
Vito Corleone
is like King Lear,

05:17.926 --> 05:20.407
except he has sons
instead of daughters.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.365
He is searching

05:22.409 --> 05:24.106
for who is going to be
his legacy.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.413
And yes, in the meantime,
he's gonna do whatever he can

05:26.456 --> 05:29.329
to provide,
to protect his family,

05:29.372 --> 05:32.462
and, yes, as a last resort,
maybe a little bit of murder.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.029
Did you eat my ham?

05:36.292 --> 05:37.641
No.

05:37.685 --> 05:41.515
There was a ham sandwich
in the refrigerator.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.387
I did not eat
the ham sandwich, Mario.

05:44.431 --> 05:47.042
You ate the ham sandwich.
I watched you eat it.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.610
It's not something
I will soon forget.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.481
What the hell was I saying?

05:51.525 --> 05:53.570
The Don wants peace.
Yes.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.442
He's ruthless
when he chooses to be.

05:55.485 --> 05:59.837
Yes. Yes. And that--
that is why he inspires fear,

05:59.881 --> 06:01.230
because of his confidence.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.884
He has immense power.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.668
He doesn't have to flaunt it.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.714
Unlike every single
studio exec I've ever met

06:06.757 --> 06:09.760
who can't wait to tell you
how well-endowed he is

06:09.804 --> 06:11.980
or better yet,
that he has the great idea

06:12.023 --> 06:13.721
that's gonna save your picture.

06:13.764 --> 06:14.765
You're gonna see.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.767
Evans, he's gonna want to cast

06:16.811 --> 06:19.204
Steve McQueen as the Don.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.641
No, I don't see anybody
but Brando in that role.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.818
Ugh, Brando.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.254
Brando is...

06:26.864 --> 06:28.431
Brando is the golden goose.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.869
He's--he's Brando.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.611
You wouldn't have to write any
character to stand up and say,

06:34.655 --> 06:36.308
"Ooh, that's the Godfather."

06:36.352 --> 06:39.268
You would see him
and you would just know it.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.405
I wrote him a letter.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.928
I sent him a signed copy
of the book.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.973
Huh.
You never know.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.540
Fingers crossed, right?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.674
Fingers crossed.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.330
Fingers crossed.

06:58.374 --> 07:01.464
What's wrong, Francis?
W--what's going on?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.292
I mean,
this is all good stuff.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.554
This is great stuff.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.426
This is all great stuff.

07:06.469 --> 07:09.037
But I can't kid myself.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.562
We are trying to write a movie
about an American family

07:12.606 --> 07:14.608
that happens to be
in the crime business.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.610
And, yes,
it's a commentary about

07:16.653 --> 07:19.395
how greed will often lead
to murder

07:19.439 --> 07:21.266
under the guise of business.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.573
I don't think
that's gonna sit very well

07:23.617 --> 07:25.314
with Evans and his bunch

07:25.357 --> 07:28.186
because at the end of the day,
no matter what he pretends,

07:28.230 --> 07:29.927
he is that capitalist.

07:29.971 --> 07:32.147
And we're gonna walk into
this little creative meeting,

07:32.190 --> 07:35.280
I have no idea why.

07:35.324 --> 07:39.502
They want their typical
little gangster flick.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.421
I'm loving you, Mario,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.641
but I have to keep
reminding myself

07:47.684 --> 07:51.079
that this is just a payday,
and I hate that.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.995
Just, uh, keep--keep working.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.352
I think
this is the part

08:03.395 --> 08:05.006
where you're supposed
to ask me if I'm all right.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.355
Listen, I won't judge you

08:06.398 --> 08:08.575
if you need to walk away
from this.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.359
I'll help you find another gig,

08:10.402 --> 08:12.404
make sure you land
on your feet.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.973
You're still gonna try
and make this thing?

08:18.889 --> 08:21.936
When I was a kid,
I was small.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.288
I mean, like really small.

08:26.331 --> 08:30.553
Like a full head shorter
than all my classmates.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.774
And there was this one guy
who just had it out for me.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.906
His name was Marcus Anderson.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.519
I don't even know
why he didn't like me but--

08:39.562 --> 08:42.173
but he didn't.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.525
This one day,
he comes up to me and he says,

08:45.568 --> 08:48.049
"I'm gonna kick your fucking
ass today after school."

08:50.094 --> 08:52.706
And I was--I was scared.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.320
And I could've told a teacher,

08:58.363 --> 09:02.063
I could've went a different
way home, but I didn't.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.021
I waited for him
right out front.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.634
I didn't hide.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.463
Let me guess--you beat
the crap out of him?

09:11.507 --> 09:12.595
No.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.597
He kicked my fucking ass.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.558
He was a big guy.

09:18.601 --> 09:19.776
You should've seen him.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.563
Oh, fuck that guy.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.959
That's a--that's a real
uplifting story, Rud.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.396
Yeah. No, he did.
He kicked my fucking ass.

09:33.442 --> 09:36.271
But I put up a good fight.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.620
And you know what?

09:37.664 --> 09:40.405
After that,
he never fucked with me again.

09:43.452 --> 09:46.368
I can't go back
to that cubicle at Rand.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.242
But I understand
if you need to cut and run.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.985
I'm not running either.

10:00.556 --> 10:03.690
So what's the move now then?

10:03.733 --> 10:06.388
You gonna go punch
Mickey Cohen?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.042
No.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.044
But I am gonna talk to him.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.504
Happy, eh?
That suit's not Czech,

10:35.547 --> 10:37.027
that is Yugoslavian.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.864
I'm so glad you came.I've missed you.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.866
Would you watch him?
Just watch him.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.781
Jesus Christ, guy's an animal.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.611
You're talking about franchise?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.004
I was, like, "What the fuck
is he talking about?"

10:57.047 --> 10:59.528
But he goes, "Like
I wouldn't throw your ball?"

11:04.098 --> 11:05.708
I broke my own rule.
I started talking shop.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.536
Goddamn it!

11:11.540 --> 11:14.586
I kind of like it.
It's like gladiators.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.198
When are you gonna
put me in the movies, Bob?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.549
Christy,
you're already in the movies.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.812
Shh.
I'm just saying.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.728
I love your work, girls.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.957
Where are you right now?

12:23.481 --> 12:25.266
In the best dream
I've ever had.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.572
You're so full of shit.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.792
You're hiding something.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.795
If you don't want to tell me,
you don't have to.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.492
It's work stuff.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.756
Maybe I can help.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.672
I'm putting together budgets,
and nobody will give me

12:40.716 --> 12:43.414
a straight answer
on union requirements.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.373
Everyone's all nervous
about some guy, Mickey Cohen.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.548
Mickey Cohen?

12:46.591 --> 12:48.158
You know him?

12:48.202 --> 12:49.638
Cohen's a criminal.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.814
He's a--he's a--
he's a low life.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.598
A thug.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.776
He, um--

12:56.819 --> 12:58.299
he came to the Chateau
a few years ago.

12:58.342 --> 13:01.041
It was--

13:01.084 --> 13:03.521
It was right after my divorce.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.829
He said he would
do me a favor and--and--

13:06.873 --> 13:08.700
and bring his business
to the Chateau.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.529
All it would take was for me to
use him as my kitchen supplier.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.880
I said "No, no, thank you."
Very nicely.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.534
And then he said,
"You need friends now."

13:16.578 --> 13:18.406
He threatened you?

13:20.887 --> 13:24.020
I ordered two glasses
of a very nice champagne,

13:24.064 --> 13:26.806
I handed him one.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.677
I looked at him

13:28.720 --> 13:31.854
and then I told him, "I faced
the Nazis and survived.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.900
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?"

13:37.817 --> 13:39.166
We clinked glasses, we drank,

13:39.209 --> 13:41.777
and he never came back
to the Chateau.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.520
He prefers the Oyster House.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.437
Baby,
you are a fucking badass.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.743
A badass who still thinks
you're hiding something.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.843
Okay, pack 'em up
and get 'em out of here.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.888
Make sure they're on time.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.847
You got it, Mickey.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.329
Is that him?

14:18.422 --> 14:21.643
You got some balls
coming in here.

14:21.686 --> 14:25.342
I just want to understand
what I did to offend you.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.823
Me? No, no, it's not me.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.565
I can give a fuck
about what you do.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.394
But they...

14:33.437 --> 14:36.266
they don't want you
making this movie.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.703
They say it's disrespectful.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.357
Who's they?

14:40.401 --> 14:43.317
The Italians back east.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.448
You're making a movie about 'em

14:44.492 --> 14:46.233
and you don't know
who they are?

14:46.276 --> 14:47.887
The movie's fictional.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.020
It's not about anybody
in real life.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.414
Except Sinatra, right?

14:53.457 --> 14:55.372
Listen, Al,

14:55.416 --> 14:56.896
I ain't here
to tell you what to do,

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
but here's the story.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.160
My friends asked me
to deliver a message,

15:00.203 --> 15:01.639
and I delivered that message.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.033
Anything beyond that,
I got no part of.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.256
How do I deal
with your friends?

15:09.299 --> 15:11.127
You want my best advice?

15:12.302 --> 15:14.957
Make a different movie.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.525
And if I don't want to make
a different movie?

15:23.183 --> 15:26.142
Oh, well, then eventually,

15:26.186 --> 15:28.449
you're gonna have to
deal with them directly, Al.

15:28.492 --> 15:31.452
And when that time comes,
and it will,

15:31.495 --> 15:35.195
above all,
be a straight shooter.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.805
They don't fire warning shots.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.683
He just had to handle
something, but he will be here.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.207
Christ!

15:47.250 --> 15:49.122
Are these, uh,
for everyone?What?

15:49.165 --> 15:50.732
Hello, everybody.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.603
Uh, where's Ruddy?

15:52.647 --> 15:54.083
Oh, he's just running
a little behind.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.998
But he said
we can go ahead and start.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.479
All right. All right, yes.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.093
Well, we're all
very excited to be here.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.269
Francis, you know Peter.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.968
And this is Andrea Eastwood,
head of casting.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.971
Now, I know that you and Mario
are deep into the process,

16:12.014 --> 16:13.973
but we just all wanted
to make sure

16:14.016 --> 16:15.975
that we're on
the same page creatively.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.412
Why don't you tell us
what you're thinking?

16:19.717 --> 16:21.241
Sure.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.766
Sure.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.898
Okay, um--

16:26.942 --> 16:28.596
It's actually
coming along really well.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.078
That's one hell
of a paperweight you got there.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.167
Okay, um--

16:35.516 --> 16:38.693
So tonally, thematically,

16:38.736 --> 16:40.695
this whole picture,

16:40.738 --> 16:43.437
it's about light and darkness.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.049
You have the bright celebration
of Connie's wedding

16:47.093 --> 16:49.965
against the dark underbelly
of Don Corleone's business.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.401
I love that. Mm.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.490
Then we introduce Michael.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.971
And Michael,
he's straddling the two worlds.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.930
When we first meet him,
he's very much in the light.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.107
And then,
when he comes to the wedding,

17:01.150 --> 17:04.327
I think that he should be
in full uniform, okay?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.721
He's got the colorful medals,
it's, like, uh, he's glowing.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.070
It's just after World War II,

17:08.114 --> 17:09.550
and Michael
represents hope again

17:09.593 --> 17:10.986
after a time
of great depression.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.118
Excellent, Peter.
Thank you.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.554
Yeah, I can think of
a dozen actors

17:13.597 --> 17:15.077
that would love to sink
their teeth into that.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.731
Oh, hell, yeah.

17:16.774 --> 17:17.993
I think that
when we eventually shoot this

17:18.037 --> 17:19.560
that, uh,
the whole look of the film

17:19.603 --> 17:21.605
should reflect this opposition
of the light and the dark.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.433
Make it feel real.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.218
None of these caricatures
of what a gangster is.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.697
Yeah, they're family men,

17:26.741 --> 17:28.090
they're--they're--
they're businessmen, you know,

17:28.134 --> 17:29.483
they could be your neighbor.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.224
I'm pretty sure
one of them is.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.619
Hey, Barry.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.360
I'm sorry, I thought you were
on the way to the airport.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.622
Do you need something?

17:38.666 --> 17:40.015
Oh, no, thanks, Bob.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.799
Appreciate you asking though.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.106
Everyone,
this is Barry Lapidus,

17:44.150 --> 17:46.065
Gulf and Western's
shining star,

17:46.108 --> 17:48.328
and Jack Ballard,
who runs physical production.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.981
Hey, Jack.

17:50.025 --> 17:52.462
Look, uh,
I'm a little tied up right now.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.290
Can I come and see you after?

17:54.334 --> 17:55.726
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.077
This meeting is the reason
why I'm here.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.209
Look, I know that
the last thing we all want

18:00.253 --> 18:02.211
is this production
to go off the rails

18:02.255 --> 18:04.387
and become another disaster
like "Waterloo,"

18:04.431 --> 18:07.129
so I've come to present you
with a reality check.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.262
My team has done
some financials.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.699
First off, shooting in New York
is way too expensive.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.658
Excuse me.
You can't shoot LA

18:14.702 --> 18:17.096
for New York.No. No.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.619
Of course not.

18:18.662 --> 18:22.057
Uh, Kansas City or St. Louis
could help bring costs down,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.277
especially if we don't shoot
this period.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.626
Hold on.

18:25.669 --> 18:28.542
This entire story,
it takes place

18:28.585 --> 18:31.719
in a very specific time
during post-war America.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.373
It doesn't make sense
any other way.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.244
So Michael comes home
from Vietnam

18:35.288 --> 18:36.898
instead of World War II.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.682
That makes it
even more relevant.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.249
Keep it contemporary.

18:40.293 --> 18:44.079
It's not like crime
no longer exists, right?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.037
Look, this is how
it's going to be

18:46.081 --> 18:47.604
if you want to make this movie.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.084
Wow.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.652
It's very, very
interesting, Barry.

18:51.695 --> 18:52.827
Thank you very much
for bringing

18:52.870 --> 18:54.437
that imagination to the party.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.397
You know what,
a lot of food for thought, huh?

18:57.440 --> 18:58.963
A lot of food for thought.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.184
Yeah.
Well...think hard.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.143
Oh, yeah.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.147
What'd I tell you?

19:08.190 --> 19:10.105
Fuck.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.715
Francis, listen to me.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.631
Hey, where you going?Hey, nice to see you.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.547
What the fuck just happened?Lapidus.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.684
Hey, Francis.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.294
Where were you?

19:25.338 --> 19:26.904
I was handling something
important for us.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.776
Trust me.Oh, okay.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.125
Well, was it more important

19:30.169 --> 19:32.519
than setting this
in modern times?

19:32.562 --> 19:33.781
Was it more important
than shooting

19:33.824 --> 19:35.870
"The Godfather" in St. Louis?

19:35.913 --> 19:37.350
What?
Evans said that?

19:37.393 --> 19:39.656
No, he didn't say anything.
He just sat there!

19:39.700 --> 19:42.268
You know what?
You said--

19:42.311 --> 19:44.444
you said that he was
gonna be a standup guy.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.837
You said that he was gonna
support my vision,

19:46.881 --> 19:49.057
and that empty suit
folded like origami.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.015
Listen to me, I'm gonna
take care of it, okay?

19:51.059 --> 19:52.495
But the best thing
you can do to help

19:52.539 --> 19:54.323
is just to write
an undeniable script.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.020
You're lucky
that I need this paycheck

19:56.064 --> 19:57.239
to keep my business afloat,

19:57.283 --> 19:58.284
otherwise you'd be seeing
my taillights

19:58.327 --> 19:59.763
for the last time.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.942
So now,
Barry Lapidus is dictating

20:04.986 --> 20:06.205
what "The Godfather"
is gonna be?

20:06.248 --> 20:08.903
Ruddy, Ruddy.
Stop being so emotional.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.949
Of course
I support Francis' vision.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.821
But, you know,
you gotta read the room, kid.

20:13.864 --> 20:14.909
And nothing good
would've come from

20:14.952 --> 20:16.476
me confronting Barry
right then.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.912
Fucking Barry.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.784
Barry is mad at the world

20:20.828 --> 20:22.569
because it sees him
for what he truly is:

20:22.612 --> 20:24.440
a no-talent prick.

20:24.484 --> 20:27.965
But he feels like he got a win,

20:28.009 --> 20:29.793
like he's the big man
on campus.

20:29.837 --> 20:32.231
Let him think that for now.
It keeps him out of our way.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.797
I don't know how you're being
so relaxed about this.

20:33.841 --> 20:34.972
Francis, he's about to quit.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.278
Said every director

20:36.322 --> 20:37.453
who eventually finished
their picture.

20:37.497 --> 20:41.240
Trust me,
Francis isn't going anywhere.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.285
So we don't have to set this
in present day?

20:43.329 --> 20:44.591
Ruddy--

20:44.634 --> 20:46.332
How did you get into my office?
Hmm?

20:46.375 --> 20:47.550
What do you mean?

20:47.594 --> 20:49.291
You got in

20:49.335 --> 20:51.032
because you did something
that's not done.

20:51.075 --> 20:51.989
You saw something
that you wanted

20:52.033 --> 20:54.383
and you went it for it.
Woof!

20:54.427 --> 20:57.081
You and I are not like
these corporate fucks.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.996
We don't play by the book.
We write the fucking book.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.303
Now, you want to be
a great producer?

21:01.347 --> 21:02.957
You do whatever it takes
to get your movie made

21:03.000 --> 21:04.785
the way you want to do it.
Now, you want New York?

21:04.828 --> 21:07.440
Go there, make some deals,

21:07.483 --> 21:08.789
prove that you can do it
for the money.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.704
Beg, borrow--
I don't give a fuck.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.314
Steal.
You do whatever it takes.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.708
Now...

21:14.751 --> 21:16.623
you don't have
a long track record,

21:16.666 --> 21:21.584
but you got brains,
and you got balls.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.369
Try using both.

21:23.412 --> 21:26.241
Preferably at the same time.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.079
On behalf of the Mangia
America Food Company,

21:38.122 --> 21:39.428
please allow us

21:39.472 --> 21:41.343
to lend the financial support
you requested.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.866
The League,
it's very important to us.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.695
$10,000.
What is that? An insult?

21:45.739 --> 21:47.175
No, sir, it's--

21:47.218 --> 21:48.219
it's just the beginning
of what we're prepared--

21:48.263 --> 21:49.525
Here's the beginning.

21:49.569 --> 21:50.613
Put another zero
on the end there

21:50.657 --> 21:52.180
and then we're straight.

21:52.223 --> 21:55.314
You want a $100,000?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.577
You don't think I know
how much fucking money

21:57.620 --> 21:59.883
you make a year,
you greedy fuck?

21:59.927 --> 22:02.625
You're--you're lucky, I ain't
making you kick in personally.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.324
Now, be a good boy
and add the zero.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.586
I'll take this fucking pen

22:06.629 --> 22:08.675
and I'll stab you
in the fucking throat.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.111
Add the fucking zero.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.027
Go over to the bar.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.160
David.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.858
I hope you're bringing me
something better.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.860
Not like this fucking meatball.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.775
Danny Thomas?

22:21.818 --> 22:23.342
He's not anybody's
first choice

22:23.385 --> 22:24.604
but he likes the book.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.475
He's a comedy actor
and he's Lebanese.

22:26.519 --> 22:27.824
Quinn is a great actor.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.391
He's half Mexican.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.088
He's played Arabian, Greek...

22:31.132 --> 22:33.047
Olivier is being treated
for prostate cancer.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.265
How do you know that?

22:34.309 --> 22:36.877
Okay, they're all
wonderful actors

22:36.920 --> 22:39.096
but the Don is so specific.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.750
He's explosive,

22:40.794 --> 22:43.449
and he's charismatic,
and he's warm.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.885
And I really think
that we should be talking

22:44.928 --> 22:47.017
about Brando for this.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.323
World's greatest actor.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.933
That's not happeningWhy not?

22:49.977 --> 22:51.761
Because we have no budget,

22:51.805 --> 22:53.589
and so why the hell
are we even doing this?

22:53.633 --> 22:55.896
In my experience,
if you get them excited

22:55.939 --> 22:57.506
about who you want,

22:57.550 --> 22:59.073
they'll find breakage.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.901
What's breakage?It's more money.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.381
But not for Brando.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.774
Jesus Christ, Andrea.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.428
The director, the writer,
and the producer

23:06.472 --> 23:07.603
are all on board
with this thing.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.344
So why not give it
a fucking try?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.390
Brando's an amazing actor,

23:11.433 --> 23:13.740
but he's notoriously difficult,
very expensive,

23:13.783 --> 23:15.306
and his last
four movies bombed.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.612
So there's no way in hell

23:16.656 --> 23:17.961
you're gonna get Bob Evans
to approve him.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.746
Let me worry about Bob.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.839
Why don't we start with
some low hanging fruit?

23:25.882 --> 23:29.059
Johnny Fontane, Vic Damone.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.932
That's a great idea.
Can we even get him?

23:31.975 --> 23:33.847
He's interested.
He just wants to meet you guys.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.065
Where is he?

23:35.109 --> 23:38.199
Vegas.

23:39.679 --> 23:42.377
He says,
"Today, I'm an alligator."

23:44.727 --> 23:46.773
Mr. Damone.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.252
Al Ruddy.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.732
It's great to meet you, man.
Really, pleasure.

23:49.776 --> 23:51.778
This is Francis Ford Coppola.Good to meet you.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.867
You must be Mario Puzo.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.085
In the flesh.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.479
I loved your book, man.
Good stuff.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.960
Tom Collins times four.Yes, sir.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.571
Take a seat, guys.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.791
Mr. Damone?Oh, Vic, please.

24:04.834 --> 24:08.185
Vic, my mother
was such a huge fan.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.405
"The Lively Ones," she'd listen
to it over and over again.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.581
She wore out the vinyl.
I had to go to film school

24:12.625 --> 24:14.714
just to get a little peace
and quiet, you know?

24:14.757 --> 24:18.979
With me, flattery
will get you everywhere.

24:19.022 --> 24:22.199
So Fontane...

24:22.243 --> 24:23.418
he's Sinatra, right?

24:25.289 --> 24:26.508
No.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.511
Fontane is you.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.603
Vic, what do you say?

24:34.647 --> 24:35.952
You want to talk about
the character--

24:35.996 --> 24:39.216
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Francis.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.088
I'm in.

24:41.131 --> 24:44.134
I loved "Patton,"
I love the book.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.310
And I'm sure I'll find
something to love about you.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.921
Hey, I'm the guy
with the credit card.

24:47.964 --> 24:50.837
See?
I knew he was lovable.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.753
All right, listen,

24:53.796 --> 24:55.232
let's talk more tonight
after the show.

24:55.276 --> 24:56.799
I have a great table
for you right in front.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.366
Enjoy.Oh, great.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.889
Looking forward to it, Vic.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.412
Here you go.Okay.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.153
Salute.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.156
Come on.
Come swim with me.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.331
Not--not now, sweetie.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.768
Go take a swim.
We'll go eat later.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.599
Frank.
Hey.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.562
I just got word.

25:20.606 --> 25:24.174
That producer checked in
at The Sands.

25:24.218 --> 25:27.569
Fucking Damone.
Bad enough he steals my act.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.050
Now he's gonna try
to embarrass me?

25:30.093 --> 25:32.574
You know, I bailed his old man
out of a big debt.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.576
This is how he repays me.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.666
No fucking loyalty.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.582
You, uh, want me
to take care of this, Frank?

25:40.626 --> 25:43.019
Mm.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.978
Not yet.

25:48.590 --> 25:49.678
Get me the phone.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.811
Hey, boss.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.247
What?

25:55.466 --> 25:57.251
It's Sinatra.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.296
Oh, fuck.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.388
Frank, how they hanging?

26:04.432 --> 26:05.999
Don't give me that bullshit.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.305
Look, that thing you were
supposed to take care of,

26:08.349 --> 26:09.568
it ain't been taken care of. I know.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.308
I know. I'm in the middle
of it right now.

26:11.352 --> 26:12.875
Don't worry.Don't worry?

26:12.919 --> 26:14.442
Joe, go fuck yourself.

26:14.485 --> 26:17.184
Frank, I said I'm on it.

26:17.227 --> 26:19.665
You got nothing to worry about.
Trust me.

26:19.708 --> 26:20.883
Listen to me.
Get it done.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.537
I will not be humiliated.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.627
This is my legacy
these fuckers are fucking with.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.020
Fuck this guy.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.503
Where is everybody?

27:15.546 --> 27:18.114
I told them not to come.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.986
I need to talk to you
about something.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.336
I told that fucking crooner
I'd handle the goddamn movie.

27:22.379 --> 27:23.685
If he's trying to go
around my back,

27:23.729 --> 27:25.165
he's gonna get
his vocal chords broken.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.297
It's not
about the movie, Joe.

27:27.341 --> 27:30.387
It's the League.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.872
Well, uh--

27:38.569 --> 27:40.528
What about it?

27:42.704 --> 27:46.055
We all think
you're bringing too much heat.

27:46.099 --> 27:49.015
It's not the right time
for this nonsense.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.320
The League is my thing,
Carlo.

27:50.364 --> 27:53.106
I--I ain't asking for help.

27:53.149 --> 27:56.631
Your thing is bringing us
too many problems.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.069
You should've used Biaggi
as the face of this thing.

28:00.113 --> 28:03.333
He's pissed.Oh, fuck that crook.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.683
What?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.641
We answer to corrupt
politicians now?

28:06.685 --> 28:10.340
We don't answer to nobody.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.778
But sometimes we listen.

28:12.821 --> 28:17.217
That Congressman picks up
the phone and calls the FBI,

28:17.260 --> 28:19.741
the storm falls on all of us.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.264
Be reasonable, Joe.

28:21.308 --> 28:25.094
What I'm doing
is a long time coming, Carlo.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.966
The Jews got the JDL.

28:27.009 --> 28:29.490
The--the--the Blacks
got the NAACP.

28:29.533 --> 28:32.014
Shit,
even the Irish got the PBA.

28:32.058 --> 28:34.364
We need our own thing.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.236
We have our own thing.

28:36.279 --> 28:39.587
You know what I'm saying.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.155
Joe.

28:42.198 --> 28:45.549
Listen to me.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.682
Do the smart thing here.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.076
Back away.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.165
Put a politician, or a judge,

28:52.208 --> 28:54.558
or an entertainer
in the front of this.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.256
You don't need the headache.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.171
Oh, that's a good idea.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.651
Maybe we should get the guy
with the blue eyes to step up,

29:00.695 --> 29:01.696
is that what you're saying?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.263
No. Fuck that guy.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.482
I'm just saying,

29:05.526 --> 29:08.572
as the new guy at the table,

29:08.616 --> 29:11.967
you should take it slow.

29:15.101 --> 29:19.322
Well, you delivered
the message, Carlo.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.237
I'll think about what you said.

29:30.159 --> 29:32.988
Stay in the shadows.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.774
It's how things are done.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.822
Okay.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.668
Thank you very much.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.434
Thank you.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.830
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.049
Thank you.

31:18.485 --> 31:22.489
You know, I've played theatres
all over the world--

31:22.532 --> 31:24.926
Hey, Vic!Hah, who is that?

31:24.970 --> 31:27.668
You a big movie star now?

31:27.711 --> 31:30.366
Rumor has it you're gonna play
Johnny Fontane

31:30.410 --> 31:32.542
in "The Godfather."

31:39.723 --> 31:41.943
I was approached
for the role,

31:41.987 --> 31:43.466
but I turned them down.

31:43.510 --> 31:44.946
I would never lend my name

31:44.990 --> 31:47.079
to something
with such an extreme bias

31:47.122 --> 31:49.211
against my Italian heritage.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.526
What the hell?What just happened?

31:59.569 --> 32:02.398
Sinatra happened.

32:02.442 --> 32:03.791
Fuck.
Maestro?

32:03.834 --> 32:05.445
Now, one of my favorite songs.

32:05.488 --> 32:09.101
This is one I recorded in 1957.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.583
Damone's gone already.

32:13.627 --> 32:15.890
What a wimp.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.326
We're never going to
make this movie.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.502
Yes, we are.
Fuck Damone.

32:19.546 --> 32:20.982
No.

32:21.026 --> 32:24.072
It's just--it's a cancer,
it's going to--

32:24.116 --> 32:29.121
it's going to eat our souls
a piece at a time.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.513
No. No.

32:30.557 --> 32:33.821
Francis, listen to me.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.779
We are making this movie,
okay?

32:35.823 --> 32:37.520
And it's gonna be great.

32:37.564 --> 32:38.652
It's gonna be better
than anybody ever had

32:38.695 --> 32:39.958
a right to expect.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.350
Because you've got
a real vision for this,

32:41.394 --> 32:43.352
and I'm gonna get you
what you need, okay?

32:43.396 --> 32:46.094
But you gotta fucking trust me.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.226
If I say
I'm gonna handle something,

32:47.269 --> 32:49.010
I'm gonna handle it.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.881
Might not be right away
or the way you wanted,

32:50.925 --> 32:53.275
but I will fucking get it done.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.411
You're there for me,
I'm there for you.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.021
You respect the budget,
you don't go over,

33:00.065 --> 33:02.502
and I will fucking kill
for you, man.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.461
We're a team.

33:19.432 --> 33:20.999
Hey, I want in on this.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.915
This movie's gonna
be fucking great.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.134
Okay? All right.

33:26.178 --> 33:27.309
Okay, okay.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.575
Sorry.
No.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.055
Were you here long?

33:34.099 --> 33:37.058
No, not at all.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.799
Good, then I can stop
pretending I feel bad.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.545
Is it true that John Bonham

33:45.588 --> 33:48.504
drove his Harley Davidson
through the lobby here?

33:48.548 --> 33:50.767
Well, it's the same carpeting.
See for yourself.

33:50.811 --> 33:53.640
Were you
here that night?Yup, I was.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.250
Same night I found
my ex-husband

33:55.294 --> 33:57.557
fucking Tura Satana
in the bungalow.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.342
At the time, I thought it was
the worst night of my life.

34:00.386 --> 34:03.215
But now I own this place,
and he's in Ohio,

34:03.258 --> 34:06.087
so turns out it was
the worst night of his life.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.046
Mm-hmm.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.352
Best part of marriage
is divorce, I guess.

34:10.396 --> 34:13.529
In my case, yes.

34:19.796 --> 34:22.669
Bourbon.
Mm.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.540
It's good, eh?

34:24.584 --> 34:28.370
It's made in Kentucky.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.068
You know that, per capita,
Kentucky had

34:30.111 --> 34:32.679
the most American men
serve in the war?

34:32.722 --> 34:34.724
I didn't know that.
Yes.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.205
That's why I drink it.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.120
Don't ask for Irish whiskey
at my bar.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.556
I don't carry it.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.515
Do you want to know why?

34:42.558 --> 34:44.082
Mm-hmm.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.172
During the war,
Ireland didn't let

34:47.215 --> 34:49.739
Allied troops use their ports.

34:49.783 --> 34:53.091
Not for munitions,
not for soldiers, not for--

34:53.134 --> 34:55.702
not for fucking food.

34:55.745 --> 34:57.834
They just stayed
on the sidelines

34:57.878 --> 35:00.489
while millions
were exterminated.

35:00.533 --> 35:03.927
and you--
you know what I say to them?

35:03.971 --> 35:06.016
Fuck them.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.368
I like rum anyway.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.021
The reason
why I'm telling you this

35:11.065 --> 35:13.154
is so you understand the...

35:13.198 --> 35:16.026
the type of grudge-holding
woman I am

35:16.070 --> 35:18.507
before I ask you
what I'm about to ask you.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.381
Okay.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.514
What's Al hiding?

35:25.558 --> 35:29.083
Françoise, I--

35:29.127 --> 35:31.303
I'm not sleeping--I don't mean other women.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.522
I--I'm not worried about that.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.133
I know where his dick
goes every night.

35:37.178 --> 35:40.747
I mean something else.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.183
There's something
heavy around him

35:42.227 --> 35:44.925
that he's not telling me.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.927
What is it?

35:48.320 --> 35:50.191
I'm not gonna sit here
and lie to you.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.068
I'm also not gonna
say anything if he hasn't.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.029
So you're Ireland.

36:03.465 --> 36:06.251
I'm an ally.
I'm just not yours.

36:09.341 --> 36:12.474
Touché, mon ami.

36:12.518 --> 36:15.085
I get why Al likes you.

36:15.129 --> 36:16.826
Let's have another drink.

36:16.870 --> 36:20.265
Adam, uh, can we get
two glasses of Mount Gay?

36:25.357 --> 36:29.970
Andrea, how many Redford
knock-offs must we see

36:30.013 --> 36:32.494
before you realize that
none of them are right?

36:32.538 --> 36:35.062
You know, it would be easier
to narrow it down

36:35.105 --> 36:36.933
if we had a script.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.152
I don't need a script.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.153
We're just gonna be
another second.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.808
Andrea,
I know who Michael is.

36:42.809 --> 36:45.333
Who?
Al Pacino.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.553
Has he done any film?

36:47.596 --> 36:50.077
He's about to go do
"Panic in Needle Park,"

36:50.120 --> 36:51.992
he just won an Obie for
"The Indian Wants the Bronx."

36:52.035 --> 36:53.907
Off Broadway.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.778
What's the difference?
He's--he--he's terrific.

36:55.822 --> 36:58.390
I saw it. I agree.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.261
But the studio
will never approve him.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.741
Why not?

37:01.784 --> 37:03.612
He's not Bob Evans' type.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.875
He doesn't have to date him,
he just has to approve him.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.964
He has the quiet intensity
that I want.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.227
And he's Italian.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.272
It's not gonna happen.Listen to me,

37:11.316 --> 37:13.970
I can't sit through another
WASP mispronouncing Corleone.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.929
Core-lay-o-knee,
Core-lay-own.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.496
Hi, guys.
Thanks for waiting...

37:19.367 --> 37:20.673
Are you sure he's your guy?

37:20.716 --> 37:23.241
Yes. Yes. Yes.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.678
He's the only Michael.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.810
I'll get you Pacino.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.075
So where is the old bastard?

37:32.119 --> 37:33.207
I'm sorry, Mr. Evans,

37:33.251 --> 37:35.514
I tried to tell you
on the phone.

37:35.557 --> 37:36.863
Mr. Bluhdorn is in Europe,

37:36.906 --> 37:38.343
and he won't be back
until Monday.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.649
Hmm.
Fair enough.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.303
Well, that'll teach me

37:42.347 --> 37:44.131
to try to go around you
and schedule a meeting.

37:44.174 --> 37:46.133
I'm sorry, sir.

37:46.176 --> 37:47.569
Don't worry, beautiful.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.006
I'll catch him next time.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.454
Excuse me, Mr. Evans. Sir--

38:04.717 --> 38:06.458
Evans.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.502
Certainly
wasn't expecting you.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.677
Weren't expecting what?

38:08.721 --> 38:10.113
Me to barge into your office

38:10.157 --> 38:11.854
the way you barged
into my creative meeting?

38:11.898 --> 38:14.640
I'll give you two a minute.No, don't move.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.076
Listen here, Bob--No, no.

38:16.119 --> 38:18.644
You listen to me,
you fucking accountant.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.123
I run the studio.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.516
Now, you want to visit,

38:21.560 --> 38:23.779
next time you call me
and you ask my permission.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.607
Stop thinking with your ego,

38:25.651 --> 38:27.479
and think
with your goddamn head.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.916
Paramount is both
of our business.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.440
Bob Evans is the movies,
you prick.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.224
Why don't you stick
to what you know best?

38:34.268 --> 38:36.749
Numbers and stocks,
watered-down cocktails

38:36.792 --> 38:38.359
with your Wharton groupies
at the Carlyle,

38:38.403 --> 38:39.665
whatever the fuck it is you do!

38:39.708 --> 38:42.189
But you stay off my lot.

38:43.756 --> 38:46.367
Have a nice day, Jack.Bob.

38:46.411 --> 38:47.586
Tracy!

38:50.415 --> 38:52.330
I am so--Close the fucking door.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.158
I don't know
how you stay comfortable

38:55.202 --> 38:57.378
in that skirt all day.

38:57.422 --> 38:58.510
It's a skirt.

38:58.553 --> 38:59.902
What's not comfortable
about it?

38:59.946 --> 39:01.339
I mean, doesn't it
restrict your movement?

39:01.382 --> 39:03.602
What if you want to cartwheel
or something?

39:03.645 --> 39:05.604
I mean, I'm not doing
a lot of cartwheels.

39:05.647 --> 39:08.346
Are you doing a lot
of cartwheels around here?

39:08.389 --> 39:09.608
I just think that
an everyday skirt

39:09.651 --> 39:12.567
is a symbol of the past,
that's all.

39:12.611 --> 39:16.397
So, uh, how'd you start
working with Ruddy?

39:16.441 --> 39:18.573
I've never seen an assistant
this involved in the process.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.749
Did you know him
from before or--

39:20.793 --> 39:23.012
I didn't fuck him,
if that's what you're asking.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.971
That's not what I meant.
No, no, no.

39:25.014 --> 39:28.148
It's just that, you know,
Ruddy gives you autonomy,

39:28.191 --> 39:30.890
and not every producer's
like that.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.675
So tell me, how did you
become head of casting?

39:33.719 --> 39:37.375
I'd like to think it's 'cause
I have a real eye for talent.

39:37.418 --> 39:38.637
But it might have
been the skirt.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.203
I don't know, you know?

39:40.247 --> 39:41.770
God, I wish I could
tell these actors

39:41.814 --> 39:43.337
the truth, you know?

39:43.381 --> 39:46.209
Like,
"Hey, you're talented but, uh,

39:46.253 --> 39:48.386
"getting this part has nothing
to do with talent,

39:48.429 --> 39:51.127
"it has to do with,
um, the size of your nose,

39:51.171 --> 39:53.173
"and your height,
and who you know,

39:53.216 --> 39:55.175
"who you fucked, the rumors
about who you fucked.

39:55.218 --> 39:56.698
If you're open to fucking."

39:56.742 --> 39:59.701
There is--literally, it has
nothing to do with talent.

39:59.745 --> 40:04.706
It has to do with the opinions
of a bunch of old men in suits.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.976
Look, maybe Sonny should
show Michael what to do.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.891
You know, the older brother

40:15.935 --> 40:17.327
showing the younger
brother the ropes.

40:17.371 --> 40:18.633
No. No.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.418
I love what you did
in the novel.

40:20.461 --> 40:22.028
It has to be Clemenza.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.725
Clemenza's like your uncle.

40:23.769 --> 40:25.379
He--he's got the warmth.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.686
He can stand in
for Michael's father.

40:27.729 --> 40:31.167
Instead of the uncle
teaching you how to tie a tie,

40:31.211 --> 40:32.604
he's teaching him
how to kill two guys.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.562
Yes. Yes, yes.

40:34.606 --> 40:37.478
And why is your detail
so magnificent?

40:37.522 --> 40:40.873
Because the repetition, okay?

40:40.916 --> 40:43.919
When Clemenza says to Michael--

40:43.963 --> 40:45.530
he says it over
and over again to him.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.880
"Michael, when you kill Solozzo
you have to remember

40:47.923 --> 40:49.621
you let your hand
go down by your side,

40:49.664 --> 40:51.666
and you drop the gun."

40:51.710 --> 40:53.581
That's perfect.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.501
Follow me.
Okay.

41:00.545 --> 41:04.549
So we cut to Michael,

41:04.592 --> 41:06.420
he kills Solozzo.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.509
He kills McCluskey

41:08.553 --> 41:11.033
But then,

41:11.077 --> 41:13.688
he holds on to the gun.

41:13.732 --> 41:16.343
He doesn't let it drop.

41:16.386 --> 41:19.041
He hangs on for too long.
He does not listen to Clemenza.

41:19.085 --> 41:20.521
Why?

41:20.565 --> 41:22.218
Why aren't you listening
to Clemenza, Michael?

41:22.262 --> 41:23.393
Why are you hesitating?

41:23.437 --> 41:24.830
And the tension,
the tension is building.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.832
Why? Why?
We're wondering why.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.312
Why are you not listening
to Clemenza, Michael?

41:29.356 --> 41:31.706
And just when we can't
take it anymore,

41:31.750 --> 41:34.013
that's when he lets it fall,

41:34.056 --> 41:36.537
and we're okay again.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.583
We know that Michael's
gonna be fine.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.846
Why is this scene beautiful?

41:40.889 --> 41:44.153
Because it's not just the death
of Solozzo and McCluskey.

41:44.197 --> 41:46.982
It's the death of who Michael
could have been.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.854
He goes all the way

41:48.897 --> 41:51.117
from being the total outsider
of his family,

41:51.160 --> 41:54.207
and the transformation
to becoming the leader

41:54.250 --> 41:56.557
of the Corleone family
has begun

41:56.601 --> 41:58.951
right here in this scene.

42:00.735 --> 42:03.042
Say all of that again.

42:13.748 --> 42:16.011
Congressman Biaggi.

42:16.055 --> 42:18.492
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.189
Françoise always
takes care of me

42:20.233 --> 42:23.845
when I'm on the West Coast,
so here we are.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.368
Everyone says
you're the guy I need to see

42:25.412 --> 42:27.501
to shoot here in New York.

42:27.545 --> 42:28.589
I know you have
some reservations

42:28.633 --> 42:29.851
about "The Godfather."

42:29.895 --> 42:32.201
I told Françoise
I'd keep an open mind.

42:32.245 --> 42:34.377
Now, I understand
that there are a lot of people

42:34.421 --> 42:36.902
who think this book
is anti-Italian.

42:36.945 --> 42:39.513
That is not the story
that we are looking to tell.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.515
We're making a movie
about society,

42:41.559 --> 42:43.169
not just Italians.

42:43.212 --> 42:46.128
This is not just
some gangster film,

42:46.172 --> 42:48.087
it's about family,

42:48.130 --> 42:53.309
and the price that children pay
for the sins of their fathers.

42:53.353 --> 42:55.311
Look,

42:55.355 --> 42:56.574
we want to make a movie

42:56.617 --> 42:59.402
that all Italians
will be proud of.

43:01.317 --> 43:03.189
Mr. Ruddy,

43:03.232 --> 43:06.496
I have the greatest respect
for Françoise,

43:06.540 --> 43:08.237
but I must say no to you.

43:08.281 --> 43:09.848
And I'll give you my reason.

43:09.891 --> 43:12.590
It's true,
I have a lot of friends

43:12.633 --> 43:14.635
in the mayor's film office,

43:14.679 --> 43:17.246
but this book,
this potential movie,

43:17.290 --> 43:18.552
no matter what you say,

43:18.596 --> 43:22.164
is and would be
an insult to my heritage.

43:22.208 --> 43:25.472
But Congressman,
there's a lot--

43:25.515 --> 43:27.300
I understand
you're disappointed.

43:27.343 --> 43:30.085
But you will not make
this movie in New York.

43:30.129 --> 43:32.087
Hmm.

43:32.131 --> 43:33.306
And if I have my way,

43:33.349 --> 43:35.525
you won't make
this movie at all.

43:35.569 --> 43:38.964
Mario Puzo is a traitor

43:39.007 --> 43:41.619
and in this town, my word
still means something, so--

43:42.837 --> 43:44.143
Thank you for coming to see me

43:44.186 --> 43:47.189
but again, I must say no.

43:49.931 --> 43:51.933
Mr. Pacino--All right. All right.

43:51.977 --> 43:53.282
Thank you very much.

43:53.326 --> 43:55.067
Thanks for setting me up
with Biaggi.

43:55.110 --> 43:56.677
Of course.

43:56.721 --> 43:58.374
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

43:58.418 --> 44:00.028
I mean, you came all the way
to New York.

44:00.072 --> 44:01.639
It's ridiculous.Oh, look, it's all right.

44:01.682 --> 44:04.685
I got a lot of fish
to fry here anyway.

44:04.729 --> 44:07.819
Well, you know, I'll always
do anything I can to help you.

44:07.862 --> 44:09.951
I know, baby.

44:09.995 --> 44:11.910
Al!

44:14.826 --> 44:17.655
Hey. Great stuff, man.

44:17.698 --> 44:20.614
You hungry?

44:20.658 --> 44:22.747
I could eat.

44:22.790 --> 44:24.966
Thank you.

44:25.010 --> 44:26.533
Where do you put it?

44:26.576 --> 44:28.796
Not sure I'm
a starving artist,

44:28.840 --> 44:30.842
but I'm definitely
a starving actor.

44:32.844 --> 44:34.715
I hope you don't mind
I ordered the menu, Al.

44:34.759 --> 44:36.499
Listen, you agree
to read for Michael,

44:36.543 --> 44:38.458
I'll take you to Chasen's
once a week until you die.

44:38.501 --> 44:41.461
Um, um--

44:41.504 --> 44:43.463
uh, I read the book.

44:43.506 --> 44:44.899
Uh, it's not bad.

44:44.943 --> 44:47.815
But, uh, I don't know.

44:47.859 --> 44:49.295
Michael's the lead, right?

44:49.338 --> 44:50.688
One of them, yeah.

44:50.731 --> 44:52.385
He's the Don in waiting.

44:52.428 --> 44:53.821
You see,
that's my problem, Al.

44:53.865 --> 44:57.303
I, uh, I guess I just don't
see myself as a lead.

44:57.346 --> 44:59.827
Really?
But you're such a talent.

44:59.871 --> 45:01.394
You're very kind.

45:01.437 --> 45:03.178
Thank you.

45:03.222 --> 45:07.443
Um, how about Sonny, hmm?

45:07.487 --> 45:08.618
Now--now that's a role
I'd be interested

45:08.662 --> 45:09.837
in taking a real big swing at.

45:09.881 --> 45:11.230
Sonny's a great character.

45:11.273 --> 45:12.971
He's certainly a big impact
player in this,

45:13.014 --> 45:15.800
but we really want you
for Michael.

45:15.843 --> 45:17.236
Who's "we"?

45:17.279 --> 45:20.195
Well, it's myself
and Francis Ford Coppola.

45:20.239 --> 45:22.589
Coppola?

45:22.632 --> 45:24.330
I thought you said
Puzo was writing.

45:24.373 --> 45:25.679
What's--what's Coppola doing?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.550
Francis is co-writing
and directing.

45:27.594 --> 45:30.771
I'll be straight with you, Al,
you're all he talks about.

45:30.815 --> 45:33.818
Coppola knows who I am?

45:33.861 --> 45:35.123
He thinks you're the only
person alive

45:35.167 --> 45:36.168
that can pull this off.

45:36.211 --> 45:38.431
Ah, he said that?

45:38.474 --> 45:40.520
He did.

45:40.563 --> 45:42.870
He also said I cannot
let you leave this dinner

45:42.914 --> 45:45.220
until you agree
to read for Michael.

45:45.264 --> 45:46.961
Those were his orders.

45:55.317 --> 45:57.711
Here's what I'll do.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.235
I'm gonna order
three desserts...

46:00.279 --> 46:02.542
and then,
I'll agree to read for you.

46:02.585 --> 46:03.935
How's that sound?

46:03.978 --> 46:06.198
It's music to my ears.

46:06.241 --> 46:07.895
All right.Uh, excuse me.

46:07.939 --> 46:09.810
Can we have
the dessert menu, please?

46:33.529 --> 46:34.922
What the fuck?

46:46.804 --> 46:48.806
Jesus!
Fuck!

46:51.373 --> 46:53.854
God, man, what the fuck?

47:08.564 --> 47:09.957
Hello?

47:10.001 --> 47:11.872
You get my little gift?

47:11.916 --> 47:14.092
Now you know
what you gotta do.

47:14.135 --> 47:15.310
Who is this?

47:18.574 --> 47:19.749
I mean, I thought
he was pretty good.

47:19.793 --> 47:21.882
Yeah.

47:21.926 --> 47:24.232
He's a little short, but...Yeah.

47:24.276 --> 47:27.061
He's got that thing,
you know?

47:27.105 --> 47:28.628
Charisma.

47:28.671 --> 47:30.499
I mean, when he--
when he looks at you,

47:30.543 --> 47:33.502
it's like--it's like you
lose yourself in him.

47:33.546 --> 47:36.636
Don't hold back, honey.

47:36.679 --> 47:39.552
I never hold back
with you, Al.

47:39.595 --> 47:42.163
You, on the other hand...

47:42.207 --> 47:45.036
Me on the other hand,
what?

47:46.733 --> 47:48.691
Well, I'm just wondering
when you're gonna tell me

47:48.735 --> 47:51.129
about what happened
with Mickey Cohen.

48:05.317 --> 48:07.972
I just didn't
want to upset you.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.149
Just always be honest with me

48:11.192 --> 48:15.327
and you'll never have
to worry, all right?

48:15.370 --> 48:17.285
You're right.

48:17.329 --> 48:20.332
Message received.Good.

48:20.375 --> 48:22.247
I'm sorry.

48:25.685 --> 48:28.818
The truth is, there are a lot
of people here in New York

48:28.862 --> 48:31.691
who don't want us
to make "The Godfather."

48:31.734 --> 48:34.955
Apart from the Congressman?

48:34.999 --> 48:37.262
Mickey Cohen was delivering
their message.

48:39.003 --> 48:42.180
But don't worry,
I handled it.

48:44.269 --> 48:46.706
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise.

49:35.842 --> 49:37.148
Fuck.

49:40.194 --> 49:42.022
I might need to get that.Oh, no.

49:45.939 --> 49:48.289
All right.No! No! No.

49:48.333 --> 49:51.292
Baby.
Baby, come on.

49:57.820 --> 50:00.910
Hello.Hello? Oui, bonjour?

50:00.954 --> 50:03.478
Wait, Bob?

50:03.522 --> 50:04.653
Okay, okay, all right.

50:04.697 --> 50:07.830
Calm down, calm down.
What?

50:07.874 --> 50:10.659
Uh-huh.

50:10.703 --> 50:14.446
Yeah, yeah.

50:14.489 --> 50:16.013
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Bye.

50:19.494 --> 50:21.018
Five minutes.He all right?

50:21.061 --> 50:23.933
Yup, everything's good.

50:30.636 --> 50:32.290
Hey, there he is.
There he is.

50:32.333 --> 50:35.075
Hey! Ruddy! Ruddy!

50:35.119 --> 50:36.772
Get in the car.

50:36.816 --> 50:38.122
You okay?Get in the car!

50:38.165 --> 50:39.384
I've got a flight to catch.

50:39.427 --> 50:41.647
And, no, I'm not fucking okay.

50:41.690 --> 50:43.518
Hey.

50:44.345 --> 50:47.348
Bob, tell me,
what's going, man?

50:47.392 --> 50:48.784
The goddamn mafia
put a fucking rat

50:48.828 --> 50:50.612
in my fuckin' bed.

50:50.656 --> 50:52.527
A what?A fuckin' rat.

50:52.571 --> 50:55.487
Wrapped in your book,
"The Godfather."

50:55.530 --> 50:56.966
All right.
Look, just relax.

50:57.010 --> 50:59.708
Fuck you!
"Relax." Fuck you.

50:59.752 --> 51:01.232
I don't know what the fuck
you got me into,

51:01.275 --> 51:02.842
but I am not getting killed

51:02.885 --> 51:04.104
for some gangster movie,
all right?

51:04.148 --> 51:05.540
Now,
this is your fucking job.

51:05.584 --> 51:07.629
You deal with it
or I swear to God,

51:07.673 --> 51:10.763
I will shut this picture down,
understand?

51:10.806 --> 51:12.417
I mean, what was I thinking?I'm gonna handle it, okay?

51:12.460 --> 51:13.766
I'm gonna handle it.Good.

51:13.809 --> 51:15.768
You do that.

51:17.552 --> 51:20.251
Comfortable?
Get the fuck out of my car.

51:20.294 --> 51:21.556
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.950
Get the fuck out.

51:23.993 --> 51:26.474
Fucking amateur.
Hit it, Michael.

51:41.533 --> 51:43.143
You look like shit.

51:43.187 --> 51:45.145
Still prettier than you,
bubbie.

51:45.189 --> 51:47.800
I'm assuming you haven't read
the trades today.

51:47.843 --> 51:50.063
Hmm? We're in trouble.

51:50.107 --> 51:51.456
Paramount being
on the losing team

51:51.499 --> 51:52.718
in Hollywood
is hardly a secret.

51:52.761 --> 51:53.936
You know,
"Variety" needs to find

51:53.980 --> 51:55.677
a new fucking story, man.

51:55.721 --> 51:58.245
Paramount's not the story.

51:58.289 --> 52:00.247
You are.

52:08.603 --> 52:11.737
Fucking Lapidus.

52:17.438 --> 52:20.746
How long have you been up?

52:20.789 --> 52:23.357
A little while.

52:25.707 --> 52:27.666
I need coffee.

52:27.709 --> 52:30.016
Why don't we get
breakfast sent up?

52:32.497 --> 52:34.368
Can't, baby. I gotta figure
this New York shit out

52:34.412 --> 52:37.502
if we're gonna shoot here.

52:37.545 --> 52:39.939
Would you at least get me
one of those croissant I like

52:39.982 --> 52:43.116
from the cart on the corner
before you desert me?

52:48.774 --> 52:52.038
You are at one of the nicest
hotels in the world

52:52.081 --> 52:53.996
and you want me
to get you a croissant

52:54.040 --> 52:55.998
from a cart on the street?

52:56.042 --> 52:57.826
Yes.

52:57.870 --> 53:00.742
That's my girl.

53:00.786 --> 53:02.962
I'm very fancy, you know.

53:03.005 --> 53:06.226
Yes, you are.
You are very fancy.

53:07.358 --> 53:09.490
And a coffee as well.And a coffee.

53:13.233 --> 53:14.539
Hey,
you're Al Ruddy, right?

53:14.582 --> 53:16.541
Yeah, look,
there's somebody important

53:16.584 --> 53:17.890
who wants to talk to you.

53:17.933 --> 53:19.544
Get in the car.

53:19.587 --> 53:21.372
Yeah, look, I'm a--
I'm a little busy right now.

53:22.764 --> 53:24.723
Get in the car.

53:26.420 --> 53:29.118
I'm not gonna ask you again.

53:47.006 --> 53:48.877
Take the bridge.

55:10.394 --> 55:11.395
What's Al hiding?

55:11.830 --> 55:13.048
There's something
heavy around him

55:13.092 --> 55:14.441
that he's not telling me.

55:14.485 --> 55:16.400
I'm not gonna sit here
and lie to you.

55:17.270 --> 55:19.228
I'm also not gonna say
anything if he hasn't.

55:19.272 --> 55:21.187
It was very important to us

55:21.230 --> 55:25.844
that in a story primarily
dominated by males,

55:25.887 --> 55:28.760
that the female characters
had their own agency

55:28.803 --> 55:31.371
and were not just props
in the men's story lines.

55:31.415 --> 55:32.633
Touché, mon amie.

55:35.549 --> 55:38.378
It was very important
to highlight

55:38.422 --> 55:40.772
how ahead of their time
these women were.

55:41.120 --> 55:43.340
I'm an ally, I'm just not yours.

55:43.383 --> 55:46.038
They succeeded in spite
of the challenges

55:46.081 --> 55:47.735
that were in front of them.

55:47.779 --> 55:49.215
I get why Al likes you.

55:49.258 --> 55:53.001
Bettye, I think ultimately
in my perception of it,

55:53.045 --> 55:55.613
she really handles herself
in a way

55:55.656 --> 55:57.615
that I think
is quite inspirational

55:57.658 --> 56:00.400
for past, present,
and future females

56:00.444 --> 56:01.836
because she does it with grace,

56:01.880 --> 56:04.404
and also I think she's
incredibly loyal.

56:04.448 --> 56:07.276
You see that with
the relationship
between her and Ruddy.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.930
I understand if you need to cut
and run.

56:09.496 --> 56:10.932
I'm not running either.

56:10.976 --> 56:12.369
Bettye was like
a relative of mine.

56:12.412 --> 56:13.674
And the minute I met her,

56:13.718 --> 56:15.110
I knew this was the right person
for me.

56:15.502 --> 56:16.982
So what's the move now then?

56:17.591 --> 56:19.506
This is Andrea Eastman,
Head of Casting.

56:19.550 --> 56:21.421
She's one of the only women

56:21.465 --> 56:23.597
that had such
a high power position.

56:23.641 --> 56:25.207
She's a big deal at Paramount.

56:25.251 --> 56:26.339
I agree.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.080
It was such a boys' club
back then.

56:28.123 --> 56:29.211
How do you know that?

56:29.255 --> 56:30.735
I thought it was
really well-written

56:30.778 --> 56:35.087
to show how she kind of
exerts herself in that world,

56:35.130 --> 56:37.959
and how she does it
in such a feminine way.

56:38.003 --> 56:39.526
She's really fun,

56:39.570 --> 56:42.268
and she shows it in her outfits
and her makeup and her hair.

56:42.311 --> 56:43.617
I don't know
how you stay comfortable

56:43.661 --> 56:44.923
in that skirt all day.

56:44.966 --> 56:46.403
It's a skirt, what's not
comfortable about it?

56:46.446 --> 56:47.926
I could talk about
that scene forever.

56:47.969 --> 56:49.841
I have so many good things
to say about that scene.

56:50.232 --> 56:52.191
I loved it, first and foremost,

56:52.234 --> 56:54.280
for the relationship
between Bettye and Andrea,

56:54.323 --> 56:56.064
how they're kind of
sussing each other out.

56:56.108 --> 56:59.590
So how'd you start working
with Ruddy?

56:59.633 --> 57:01.940
I've never seen an assistant
this involved in the process.

57:01.983 --> 57:04.246
We're both kind of like,
"Did you?"

57:04.290 --> 57:05.857
I didn't fuck him,
if that's what you're asking.

57:05.900 --> 57:08.599
They were two women that
are navigating the world

57:08.642 --> 57:10.557
in a very, very different way,

57:10.601 --> 57:13.430
but are still fierce
in their own right,

57:13.952 --> 57:17.216
not just because they were
women doing these jobs,

57:17.259 --> 57:20.306
but because they were
incredible people
doing these jobs.

57:20.349 --> 57:21.916
How did you
become head of casting?

57:21.960 --> 57:24.876
I like to think it's 'cause
I have a real eye for talent,

57:25.703 --> 57:27.748
but it might've been the skirt.
I don't know.

57:27.792 --> 57:29.184
That scene,

57:29.228 --> 57:31.448
I think it was supposed
to be in a casting office,

57:31.491 --> 57:34.363
and Dexter Fletcher was
like, "Oh no, no, no, no.

57:34.407 --> 57:35.974
We're gonna blow the scene out.

57:36.017 --> 57:38.193
It's gonna be driving
through the Paramount lot.

57:38.237 --> 57:41.458
There's gonna be welders,
there's gonna be gladiators."

57:41.501 --> 57:44.373
We got to zip around
the Paramount lot

57:44.417 --> 57:45.810
on a Sunday when it was empty.

57:45.853 --> 57:49.553
So you fully were transported
into their universe.

57:49.596 --> 57:50.989
It was a pinch-me moment.

57:51.032 --> 57:53.687
I just-- It makes all my hair
stand up, you know?

57:55.515 --> 57:57.125
We had another scene
where Coppola

57:57.169 --> 57:58.779
and Puzo were working
on the script.

57:58.823 --> 58:00.302
They were artists,
at the end of the day.

58:00.346 --> 58:04.089
They existed based on their
imagination.

58:04.132 --> 58:06.047
Telling stories,
creating a world.

58:06.657 --> 58:09.050
I'd just met Patrick
in rehearsal,

58:09.094 --> 58:11.618
and he was like, "Yeah, I'm
looking for a place to live."

58:11.662 --> 58:13.577
And I was like,

58:13.925 --> 58:15.317
all right, I'll take a risk here

58:15.361 --> 58:17.537
out of, you know,
the love of the game.

58:17.581 --> 58:19.365
Let's get method here, man.

58:19.408 --> 58:20.322
You never know.

58:20.758 --> 58:21.628
Fingers crossed, right?

58:23.108 --> 58:25.197
He was my roommate
for the first two

58:25.240 --> 58:26.459
or three weeks of shooting.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.243
It's not something
I will soon forget.

58:28.287 --> 58:31.290
That connection when you
meet someone
who you connect with,

58:31.333 --> 58:32.987
creatively and artistically,

58:33.031 --> 58:36.164
it's a rare thing
and it's a really special thing.

58:36.208 --> 58:37.470
Did you eat my ham?

58:37.514 --> 58:40.908
So I think that gave
such a wonderful rhythm

58:40.952 --> 58:42.910
to their relationship
very quickly.

58:43.389 --> 58:44.738
I'm loving you, Mario.

58:45.217 --> 58:47.001
And I think it shows,
I think that on the screen,

58:47.045 --> 58:49.221
you see that we genuinely
really get along.

58:49.264 --> 58:50.178
Salute.

58:51.658 --> 58:53.051
That was a big risk. He could
have been a real jerk...

58:53.094 --> 58:54.443
...you know,
but he was great, he was great.

58:54.487 --> 58:55.793
How lucky are we
to have been able

58:55.836 --> 58:57.490
to develop a relationship

58:58.012 --> 59:00.101
that is gonna effortlessly
bring itself to set?

59:00.449 --> 59:01.755
It's a beautiful gift.

59:01.799 --> 59:03.235
Hey, I want in on this.
