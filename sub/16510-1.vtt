01:05.800 --> 01:09.088
Thank you, ladies. Octavia's usual spot.

01:10.555 --> 01:12.795
- Is that OK for you?
Yes.

04:11.676 --> 04:15.089
Nowhere near where you should be, Bobby.
Give me the score, will you?

04:15.096 --> 04:18.007
Wilf, the gala's only a month away.

04:18.015 --> 04:20.677
I couldn't work out what you were doing.

04:20.684 --> 04:22.675
Can we take it from the top, please?

04:30.526 --> 04:33.438
Bobby, you're going too fast for me.

04:33.446 --> 04:35.482
- I'm sorry, Cedric.
- It's 'Cee-dric'.

04:35.489 --> 04:38.901
Oh, Cee-dric. Could you give me
the intro again, please?

04:45.665 --> 04:49.873
You did it again! I'm on fire here
and you're holding me back!

04:49.877 --> 04:52.835
Be quiet!
You find this amusing. I don't!

04:52.838 --> 04:55.750
It won't be amusing
if they shut this place down.

05:00.636 --> 05:04.220
Thank you, Nigel. You are so kind
to do that. Thank you. Now stop, please.

05:04.223 --> 05:06.965
- The man said thank you. That's it.

05:06.976 --> 05:12.641
- Is there no end to your bloody talent?
- Cissy! Please... pay... attention.

05:12.647 --> 05:15.263
- Ready.
- You must listen.

05:16.318 --> 05:18.809
Never bother with him, Cissy.
He's a bully.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.982
Now, Lottie, in bars 17, 18 and 19,
you were deeply flat.

05:22.156 --> 05:25.273
No, I don't think I was.
I think the piano needs tuning.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.570
Anne, darling,
would you mind singing it for us?

05:27.578 --> 05:29.990
I don't do chorus, Cedric. I never have.

05:29.997 --> 05:34.160
I achieved immediate
international success at the Royal Opera

05:34.167 --> 05:36.158
when I was only 21 years old.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.377
Cedric, we should have been
using this room five minutes ago.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.668
Oh, yeah.
The space is entirely yours, gentlemen.

05:42.841 --> 05:45.753
The rehearsals are over. Come on, Bobby.
Come on. Hurry up.

06:03.193 --> 06:04.729
Beautiful.

06:09.658 --> 06:11.899
You're making a fool of my part.

06:26.756 --> 06:30.419
Reggie, it's empty.
You can't save seats, Reg.

06:30.427 --> 06:31.963
He's not coming.

06:31.970 --> 06:33.755
- Wilf - he's not coming.
- Why now?

06:33.762 --> 06:35.718
You seem to think
that you own the thing.

06:35.722 --> 06:38.384
We've been sitting at this table
since I first came here.

06:38.392 --> 06:40.804
- That's precisely the point.
- It's not fair, Reggie.

06:40.978 --> 06:42.969
We want the window sometimes, don't we?

06:42.980 --> 06:46.722
Yes. If this place has to shut down
in six months, which it very well might,

06:46.732 --> 06:49.690
then I want to try and remember
I once had a fucking window seat.

06:49.694 --> 06:51.230
Excuse me, please.

06:51.237 --> 06:54.649
You can't deny it, Wilf,
you soloists would be lost without us.

06:54.823 --> 06:58.657
Say that once more, and I swear
I'll ram a fork up your jacksy, Harry.

06:58.660 --> 07:00.571
- He's right, Wilf.
- Anybody got a fork?

07:00.579 --> 07:03.321
- And you know he is.
- Make that two forks.

07:03.331 --> 07:07.664
Ah, merci, Angelique. Have you
done something new to your hair?

07:07.668 --> 07:11.331
- No, I just put my fringe in front.
- Oh, I love your fringe in front.

07:11.338 --> 07:15.000
I give you extra slice
of fried bread this morning.

07:15.008 --> 07:17.374
- I noticed.
- And your favourite - apricot jam.

07:17.552 --> 07:19.793
Oh. Magnifique, Angelique.

07:19.804 --> 07:22.090
Fancy vous a little rumpy-pumpy
ce soir?

07:22.098 --> 07:24.510
Qu'est-ce que c'est, 'rumpy-pumpy'?

07:24.517 --> 07:26.097
Oh, secrets of the marriage bed -

07:26.101 --> 07:28.137
you'll have to answer my proposal
at once.

07:28.145 --> 07:29.681
Bon appÃ©tit.

07:29.688 --> 07:31.394
- Cissy, Cissy!
- Ready.

07:31.565 --> 07:34.728
- Remember the emergency meeting, 12: 15.
- Cedric. Cedric.

07:34.735 --> 07:37.316
- Breakfast time.
- This is critical.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.153
All members of the gala committee,
please note,

07:40.156 --> 07:43.148
we have a serious problem
with our star tenor, Frank White.

07:43.159 --> 07:47.322
As such, there's an emergency meeting
at 12 noon - precisely.

07:47.329 --> 07:49.786
Reggie, don't forget to remind me.

07:49.789 --> 07:51.325
I'll set my watch.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.954
Hey, what's this? Look.

07:55.128 --> 07:58.039
- Didn't you say today was the day, Reg?
- What's today?

07:58.047 --> 08:00.129
Tadek setting off
to fetch the new arrival.

08:00.132 --> 08:03.374
- There's to be a new arrival?
- Cissy, we've talked about it for days.

08:03.385 --> 08:04.921
- You too.
- Really?

08:04.929 --> 08:06.465
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

08:06.472 --> 08:08.632
- They'd only send the van for a star.
- Mm-hm.

08:08.806 --> 08:11.343
When I came,
I had to pay for me own taxi.

08:11.351 --> 08:13.763
They sent a private car
with a chauffeur for me.

08:13.770 --> 08:15.886
This is a replacement
for Leonard Timms.

08:15.897 --> 08:19.354
He was a real dear friend of mine.
I'm really gonna miss him terribly.

08:19.358 --> 08:21.644
He was a genius, you know.
He could fart at will.

08:21.652 --> 08:23.438
Yeah, Wilf, we're having breakfast.

08:23.445 --> 08:25.857
- I'm not kidding.
- But don't let that stop you.

08:25.864 --> 08:27.854
I swear it's true.
I saw it with my own eyes.

08:27.865 --> 08:31.449
He got down on all fours
and went into a meditative state.

08:31.619 --> 08:36.158
And when he was ready, he could exhale
and inhale through his anal canal.

08:37.291 --> 08:40.373
- I suppose that's the stroke talking.
- I suppose it must be.

08:40.376 --> 08:45.417
Hey, Cissy, do you think I could replace
Nobby for a quick one in the long grass?

08:46.550 --> 08:48.881
You have the nicest tits
I've ever seen in my life.

08:48.884 --> 08:50.340
Thank you.

08:51.387 --> 08:55.926
Reg, you've got to try this jam.
It is unbelievable.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.261
It's like eating Christmas.

09:34.634 --> 09:38.126
Be careful with that one.

09:38.138 --> 09:39.674
It's fragile.

09:41.223 --> 09:44.556
I come back for the trunk. And for you.

09:54.611 --> 09:57.523
I... I... I apologise.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.862
Please be kind.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.526
We were different people then.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.444
Be kind. Be kind.

10:05.912 --> 10:08.198
I can't do this. I can't. Stop. Stop.

10:08.373 --> 10:10.284
- You say to me something?
- What did you say?

10:11.292 --> 10:13.954
- Why are we stopping?
- We are not.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.792
- We're on the way.
- Right.

10:16.839 --> 10:20.377
- Should I call Dr Cogan?
- No. No, thank you.

10:26.598 --> 10:29.681
These hydrangeas are beautiful.
Do you like them, Marta?

10:29.684 --> 10:31.845
Yes, I do, but I would never
put on my table.

10:32.019 --> 10:34.101
Well, well, well, this is new.

10:34.104 --> 10:36.891
I've never seen you
arranging flowers before, Dr Cogan.

10:36.899 --> 10:40.858
Really, Wilf? Haven't you noticed we've
cut down on staff in the past months?

10:40.861 --> 10:44.819
And is this for the new arrival? Is it?
Or is that a secret?

10:44.822 --> 10:46.733
Is it, Marta?

10:46.741 --> 10:49.528
Is that a new skirt you're wearing,
Dr Cogan?

10:49.535 --> 10:51.651
It clings beautifully to you.

10:51.829 --> 10:54.945
And how it accentuates
your already beautiful legs.

10:54.956 --> 10:57.993
My goodness.
What do you think of that, Marta?

10:58.001 --> 10:59.707
I don't talk such things.

10:59.711 --> 11:02.953
You're overstepping the line, Wilf.
Go for your walk.

11:02.964 --> 11:05.579
I would love to,
if only you would come with me.

11:05.591 --> 11:07.172
Go for your walk.

11:07.176 --> 11:08.712
May I?

11:08.719 --> 11:11.882
I wonder if you could help me. I can
never do this without my glasses.

11:11.889 --> 11:13.425
I can't see a thing.

11:15.725 --> 11:17.340
You don't have a buttonhole, Wilf.

11:17.519 --> 11:19.805
Well, there you go.

11:19.813 --> 11:23.226
You know, I could propose to you, but
this is as close to kneeling as I get.

11:23.233 --> 11:25.097
Go for your walk.

11:25.109 --> 11:27.646
Sure. Would you like to join me, Marta?

11:27.653 --> 11:29.518
I don't do such things.

11:29.530 --> 11:31.612
He's a very naughty boy, Marta.

11:31.615 --> 11:34.027
He could be your father
or your grandfather.

11:34.034 --> 11:37.821
Like that. OK?
Swing it close to the ground.

11:37.829 --> 11:40.445
That's it. That's it. Like a pendulum.
Just like this.

11:40.623 --> 11:43.114
When you're finished
being a croquet expert, Nigel,

11:43.126 --> 11:44.911
I have a pound says I'll kick your arse.

11:44.918 --> 11:47.159
Ah, the way you play, you probably will.

11:47.170 --> 11:49.957
You forget -
I saw your Barber Of Seville,

11:49.965 --> 11:51.956
and your singing
brought tears to my ears.

11:53.510 --> 11:56.091
Saw you in Carmen,
I'll never forget it, but I'll try.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.835
- Morning, Nobby.
- Ah, morning, Mr Bond.

12:35.006 --> 12:37.212
- Simon, what's up?
- All good, mate.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.796
Oh, by the way, Nobby,

12:38.800 --> 12:41.416
if you get a chance,
I could use another one of the usual.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.419
- Do you need any money?
- No, it's alright.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.968
Look, I've got some change from last
time. I'll stick it in the usual place.

12:46.975 --> 12:50.307
Oh, and watch it, Cissy Robson's
been looking for you all morning.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.599
Can't think why. I'm the
most attractive man in the place.

13:00.320 --> 13:04.108
I read somewhere that the average man
thinks of sex every seven seconds.

13:04.282 --> 13:05.818
Do you?

13:05.825 --> 13:07.940
I wish it was only every seven seconds.

13:09.328 --> 13:12.946
Do you know,
the first time I set eyes on her,

13:12.956 --> 13:15.618
I thought she was
the most beautiful, sexiest creature

13:15.626 --> 13:17.332
I'd ever clapped my eyes on.

13:17.336 --> 13:18.996
Oh.

13:19.003 --> 13:21.460
Oh, Cissy, Cissy, my love,

13:21.464 --> 13:24.331
can you imagine the passionate love
we might have made?

13:24.342 --> 13:25.832
But it's not too late.

13:26.010 --> 13:29.627
We can still dive beneath the blankets
and cuddle till the end of time.

13:29.638 --> 13:32.801
- What do you say to that, sweetie?
- Ready.

13:32.808 --> 13:35.174
Why are you laughing?

13:35.185 --> 13:38.177
You'll never guess what I've been
listening to. Our Rigoletto.

13:38.188 --> 13:40.052
We are so lovely...

13:40.064 --> 13:43.022
- Uh, Cissy, the gala committee.
- Oh...

13:43.025 --> 13:45.482
This was the last time we sang it.
Remember, Reggie?

13:45.486 --> 13:47.772
- Why have they reissued it?
- I don't know.

13:47.780 --> 13:51.192
I remember the recording session,
the production, everything,

13:51.199 --> 13:52.735
like it was yesterday,

13:52.742 --> 13:55.700
and yet I can't remember
what I had for breakfast this morning.

13:55.703 --> 13:57.819
- Apricot jam.
- 'Rigoletto - Horton and Paget'.

13:57.997 --> 13:59.612
My name isn't there, of course.

13:59.624 --> 14:02.239
I should've been top of the bill -
I had the name part.

14:02.251 --> 14:05.084
Still, I made a living from it,
which was all I really wanted.

14:05.087 --> 14:08.375
I'm not like you, you see, Reggie -
you're an artist, I'm an artisan.

14:08.382 --> 14:11.623
Where's my bag?
I can't find my bag. Where is it?

14:11.634 --> 14:13.545
Oh. Thank you, Reggie.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.919
And you're safe back from Karachi,
and I'm so glad.

14:16.097 --> 14:17.633
Oh...

14:19.392 --> 14:20.972
Why Karachi?

14:20.976 --> 14:22.637
Well, her father was Indian army.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.602
- Do you think she's getting worse, Reg?
- Yes.

14:25.605 --> 14:28.438
I'm born famous, I'm sorta known

14:28.441 --> 14:30.181
If your son doesn't...
If your...

14:30.193 --> 14:33.025
Son doesn't, I bet your...
I bet your daughter knows.

14:33.195 --> 14:35.857
Boom, boom, chh!

14:35.865 --> 14:38.481
Reg, you might as well get used to it -
rap's here to stay.

14:38.492 --> 14:40.107
Oh, I don't think it is.

14:40.119 --> 14:42.029
That's what you said about The Beatles.

14:42.036 --> 14:44.027
- Well, it isn't music.
- They think it is.

14:44.038 --> 14:45.949
- Who?
- The kids you're talking to.

15:05.933 --> 15:08.515
Now this is a bloody disaster! Really!

15:08.519 --> 15:10.055
Come in, Cissy.

15:10.062 --> 15:11.598
- Oh, what?
- Cissy.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.221
- You're late.
- Sorry. I said I was sorry.

15:14.232 --> 15:15.768
Sit down.

15:15.775 --> 15:18.767
Frank White has just pulled out.
He doesn't feel up to the gala.

15:18.778 --> 15:20.393
It's even in the local paper.

15:20.405 --> 15:22.737
He's not well.
- Darling, Frank White!

15:22.741 --> 15:24.901
Oh, he's such a lovely man.

15:24.909 --> 15:26.740
This is a disaster.

15:26.744 --> 15:30.828
Because he's pulled out, ticket sales
have already fallen by 60%.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.534
The givers aren't giving.

15:32.541 --> 15:35.247
If we can't make the gala
into the hottest ticket in town,

15:35.251 --> 15:37.412
this house could collapse
about our ears.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.081
Oh! We could lose it!

15:39.088 --> 15:41.955
We have to find
a replacement for Frank immediately.

15:41.966 --> 15:44.798
Who was it who said,
'Old age is not for sissies'?

15:44.801 --> 15:48.259
I always remember that, you know,
because it's my name... and 'sissies'.

15:48.263 --> 15:52.882
Cissy, if you must speak,
please raise your hand.

15:52.893 --> 15:54.553
Now, where was I?

15:54.727 --> 15:56.558
'This is a disaster. '

15:56.562 --> 15:59.474
Of course. Yes, it is a disaster.
Yes? What?

15:59.482 --> 16:01.473
- She's raising her hand.
- What?

16:01.484 --> 16:06.318
Bette Davis. Bette Davis. She said,
she said, 'Old age is not for sissies'.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.800
- Silenzio!

16:11.300 --> 16:12.500
- Silenzio!

16:13.161 --> 16:16.618
Shut it! You will choose
a different song immediately.

16:16.622 --> 16:19.955
I'll have no 'tra-la-la' at my gala!
None of it!

16:21.585 --> 16:23.701
What about Reggie? La Donna Ã¨ Mobile.

16:23.712 --> 16:25.622
I just had a brilliant idea -

16:25.630 --> 16:29.088
to ask Reggie if he'll sing
La Donna Ã¨ Mobile.

16:29.092 --> 16:30.957
Oh, yeah, what?

16:30.969 --> 16:33.756
Reggie's a bit funny about
La Donna Ã¨ Mobile.

16:33.763 --> 16:35.378
Your job is to ask him.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.801
Please put your hand/arm down.

16:39.518 --> 16:42.305
- He won't do it.
- That was my idea.

16:42.312 --> 16:44.177
Yes, it was.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.365
Look.

17:12.381 --> 17:14.792
Oh, my God.
Oh, my.

17:19.554 --> 17:21.839
- Excuse me, love.
- Oh.

17:26.269 --> 17:27.633
Here.

17:38.571 --> 17:42.359
Most of our residents
are on the floor upstairs.

17:44.201 --> 17:46.783
This is Sir Thomas Beecham.

17:46.787 --> 17:48.947
He was one of Britain's
greatest conductors.

17:48.955 --> 17:50.911
Yes. I know who he was.

17:50.915 --> 17:54.499
He inherited a fortune.
His grandfather made laxatives.

17:54.502 --> 17:57.915
Naming a nursing home
after him is frighteningly apt.

17:58.089 --> 18:00.750
Um... These flowers are here
to welcome you.

18:00.758 --> 18:02.419
I'll have them sent up to your room.

18:02.426 --> 18:04.417
We're very lucky to have you here.

18:04.428 --> 18:06.293
Your room is as large as Anne Langley's.

18:06.305 --> 18:07.886
Oh, God, is she here?

18:07.890 --> 18:10.551
It's a beautiful suite
in what we call the B Wing.

18:10.725 --> 18:12.511
Well, it sounds like a prison.

18:12.518 --> 18:14.759
The service lift
is currently being repaired,

18:14.771 --> 18:17.308
but we have the chairlift,
which will be much easier.

18:17.315 --> 18:21.728
Chairlift? What do I do
when I get to the top, ski down?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.394
Brava!

18:25.405 --> 18:29.614
Brava! Brava!

18:31.744 --> 18:34.076
Brava! Brava!

18:34.080 --> 18:35.570
Oh.

18:39.126 --> 18:42.413
- Brava!
- Oh, how very kind.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.295
Oh...

18:45.298 --> 18:47.084
Brava!

18:58.310 --> 19:01.267
Yeah, we could always do the Barber -
you, Cissy and me.

19:01.437 --> 19:03.769
For the gala.

19:03.773 --> 19:07.561
- Oh. You moved your ball.
- That's unthinkable! How dare you!

19:07.568 --> 19:09.729
I just saw you move it. With your foot.

19:09.737 --> 19:12.398
Uh, Wilf, uh, she's married.

19:12.405 --> 19:14.316
She gave me a look.

19:17.119 --> 19:18.655
- Your shot.
- Thank you, Wilf.

19:18.662 --> 19:20.653
You're never gonna get it from there,
anyway.

19:20.831 --> 19:22.366
Oh, you watch me.

19:22.373 --> 19:23.909
Told you.

19:23.916 --> 19:27.079
I always wanted to sing
Wagner - Tristan. Never came my way.

19:27.086 --> 19:28.951
Wilf, what are you doing?

19:28.963 --> 19:31.124
What does it look like I'm doing?

19:31.132 --> 19:33.338
- Wagner!
- There are people watching.

19:33.341 --> 19:35.798
The British
should stick to British composers

19:35.802 --> 19:37.667
like Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi.

19:37.846 --> 19:39.802
Boys! Boys! Boys!

19:39.806 --> 19:42.138
I know who it is.

19:42.142 --> 19:44.177
I saw her. I saw her!

19:45.227 --> 19:48.515
George was right - it is a star.
But you'll never, never guess who it is.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.262
- Never.
- Well, tell us.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.105
Don't keep us in suspense for eternity.

19:52.109 --> 19:53.689
No, you won't believe it.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.309
As large as life
and twice as terrifying...

19:56.487 --> 19:58.603
Um... Oh, it's gone. Um... uh...

19:58.614 --> 20:00.150
Think, Cissy. Think.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.319
- Soprano, beginning with G.
- Mary Garden.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.940
- No, no, no, no.
- Rita Gorr?

20:03.952 --> 20:06.659
- Galli-Curci.
- No! No! Oh, God!

20:06.663 --> 20:08.403
Gilda.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.911
- Gilda?
- Our Gilda.

20:13.044 --> 20:15.079
- Rigoletto?
- Yes.

20:15.254 --> 20:17.586
- Jean Horton?
- Yes.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.581
Jean Horton. Yes.

20:24.804 --> 20:26.385
Oh, my darling.

20:29.309 --> 20:31.345
Steady, Reg.

20:33.438 --> 20:34.973
Excuse me, Dr Cogan.

20:34.980 --> 20:38.188
That's why you've kept it such a secret.
You didn't want me to know.

20:40.068 --> 20:42.650
- You mean Jean Horton?
- I should have been consulted.

20:43.697 --> 20:45.402
She was such a huge star...

20:45.573 --> 20:47.313
I should have been consulted.

20:47.325 --> 20:49.361
Well, she didn't want media attention...

20:49.368 --> 20:52.826
She didn't want? Nothing changes!
What about what I didn't want?!

20:54.123 --> 20:56.784
- It had nothing to do with you, Reggie.
- Obviously not!

20:56.791 --> 20:59.954
- I mean, it was simply at her request.
- She did know that I live here?

21:01.421 --> 21:03.753
She did know that I live here?

21:05.383 --> 21:07.623
Reggie, I'm sure
she's gonna be amicable...

21:07.635 --> 21:12.004
With great respect, Dr Cogan,
you don't know her.

21:13.182 --> 21:14.797
You don't know her.

21:21.689 --> 21:23.850
I wanted a dignified senility.

21:25.443 --> 21:27.524
Fat chance now she's here.

21:29.613 --> 21:31.854
I'll have to find
somewhere else to live.

21:32.032 --> 21:33.613
Sod it.

21:34.701 --> 21:37.112
Don't you have
one of your talks tomorrow, Reggie?

21:37.119 --> 21:39.986
- What?
- Your talk, with the children tomorrow.

21:39.997 --> 21:41.533
Oh, God.

21:43.709 --> 21:46.542
Uh... Excuse me.

21:53.468 --> 21:56.460
Why don't they have tenors
like Jon Vickers anymore?

21:56.471 --> 21:58.006
They just don't exist.

21:58.013 --> 22:00.425
And Freni
was such a wonderful Desdemona.

22:00.599 --> 22:02.806
Oh, I loved singing that role.

22:02.810 --> 22:04.721
It was so easy for me.

22:04.728 --> 22:07.390
Poor thing.
She's having such a hard time.

22:07.398 --> 22:10.264
Cissy, canasta! You've won!
- I win! I win!

22:10.275 --> 22:12.015
- You cheated.
- Nonsense.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.937
How dare you.
- Any of you seen?

22:14.112 --> 22:15.648
Who is that smoking?

22:15.655 --> 22:17.486
- George and Harry.
- Nobody, nothing.

22:17.490 --> 22:20.902
I don't know how many times I have
told you - smoking kills. Put those out.

22:20.909 --> 22:22.820
- What?
- Drop them on the floor, please.

22:22.828 --> 22:25.069
- Thank you.
Oh, for goodness sake.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.947
Give them a break.
George is 78, Harry's 82.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.785
Suppose they were to stop smoking -

22:29.792 --> 22:32.158
how much longer are they going to live,
a week?

22:32.169 --> 22:34.251
It would probably rain
that week, anyway.

22:34.422 --> 22:36.879
- You are a bad influence, Wilfred.
- I think so.

22:36.882 --> 22:39.122
- Have you seen Reginald?
- He went to bed early.

22:39.134 --> 22:42.467
Don't worry about him. He's as tough
as a monkey's tit, our Reggie.

22:42.470 --> 22:45.177
I think we should worry
more about Jean Horton.

23:03.197 --> 23:05.062
Ms Horton?

23:06.784 --> 23:09.116
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

23:11.413 --> 23:13.278
Isn't it a lovely room?

23:17.252 --> 23:20.244
Well, you've had a very long day.
You might want to retire early.

23:20.255 --> 23:22.495
Yes, I've not yet
entered second childhood,

23:22.506 --> 23:24.667
so please don't talk to me
as though I have.

23:24.842 --> 23:28.084
Just leave me be.
And I'll take my meals in my room.

23:28.095 --> 23:31.086
Uh... we don't usually
serve the residents in their rooms.

23:31.097 --> 23:34.134
I presume you do when the residents
are unwell. I am unwell.

23:35.643 --> 23:38.430
Well, I... I hope you feel better soon.

25:20.989 --> 25:24.026
Where do you want it, Nobby?
That's it, yeah.

25:31.415 --> 25:34.157
Yoo-hoo, Nobby! Hello, big boy.

25:34.168 --> 25:36.158
- Morning, Ms Robson.
- I'm coming right down.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.575
Good morning, Nobby!

25:58.022 --> 26:00.104
Reggie?

26:00.107 --> 26:03.349
You're the foundation, I'm the cornerstone

26:03.360 --> 26:05.692
I'm born famous, I'm sorta known

26:05.696 --> 26:08.152
And if your son doesn't,
I bet your daughter knows...

26:29.926 --> 26:31.587
- Oh.
Excuse me.

26:31.594 --> 26:33.505
This room is occupied, Wilf.

26:33.513 --> 26:36.801
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, and don't
do your toes the same colour -

26:36.807 --> 26:38.637
it's considered gauche.

26:41.645 --> 26:43.351
No breeding.

26:43.355 --> 26:44.891
Doctor, have you seen Reggie?

26:44.898 --> 26:46.980
Yes. He's using the computer
in my office.

26:47.150 --> 26:48.685
Thanks.

26:57.159 --> 26:58.989
- Morning.
- Good morning.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.531
Oh.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.447
You OK, Mr Bond?

27:09.836 --> 27:11.667
Mr Bond, are you OK?

27:11.672 --> 27:14.709
I'm... just a bit dizzy.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.799
I'm fine. Fine.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.759
Ooh.

27:36.903 --> 27:39.770
Reg? You OK?

27:42.658 --> 27:45.741
- Can I get you a coffee?
- I'm preparing my talk.

27:47.162 --> 27:50.495
Anything?

27:54.168 --> 27:55.999
Reg? Coffee?

27:56.004 --> 27:58.370
Close the door behind you, please.

27:58.381 --> 28:00.372
Yeah. OK.

28:00.383 --> 28:03.590
I said, bitch, listen up...

28:08.515 --> 28:10.346
Well, come in.

28:14.186 --> 28:15.801
Jean?

28:17.106 --> 28:18.971
It's me - Cissy.

28:20.192 --> 28:21.897
Cicely Robson.

28:23.153 --> 28:27.487
Oh! Yes, of course. Course it is.
Yes, do come in.

28:27.657 --> 28:30.364
Ah, lovely room. Bigger than mine.

28:30.368 --> 28:33.154
- How nice to see you.
- You haven't unpacked yet.

28:33.162 --> 28:36.154
I've been telling everyone
you still look like a young girl.

28:36.165 --> 28:37.871
Well, I don't feel it.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.866
Look. Huh.

28:39.877 --> 28:42.959
I'm on the waiting list for a new hip.

28:42.962 --> 28:45.795
Oh, dear. Lovely jewels.

28:46.883 --> 28:48.544
You look beautiful.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.256
You haven't changed a bit.

28:53.263 --> 28:55.128
Did they serve you breakfast
in your room?

28:55.307 --> 28:56.843
Course.

29:00.937 --> 29:02.518
Who are all these children?

29:02.522 --> 29:05.263
It's probably Reggie
giving one of his classes.

29:06.609 --> 29:08.349
Yes, of course.

29:08.361 --> 29:10.727
Reginald Paget's here, isn't he?

29:10.905 --> 29:12.486
Yes.

29:15.241 --> 29:20.452
Now I'd like to ask
if any of you have a favourite singer.

29:21.539 --> 29:23.120
Don't be shy.

29:23.124 --> 29:25.364
- Lady Gaga?
- Lady Ga-who?

29:26.919 --> 29:29.456
I'm sorry. Lady Gaga.
I don't know about Lady Gaga.

29:29.630 --> 29:31.837
Anyone else? You? Do you like Lady Gaga?

29:31.840 --> 29:37.209
Nah, Lady Gaga's pop.
I like hip-hop, period.

29:37.220 --> 29:39.586
'Hip-hop, period'?

29:39.597 --> 29:42.680
Is that the same as rap?

29:42.684 --> 29:44.640
No, it's different, slightly.

29:44.644 --> 29:48.101
- Would you mind telling me what rap is?
- Tell me what opera is.

29:48.105 --> 29:51.893
No, yes, uh, well, yes,
I will... I will eventually.

29:51.900 --> 29:55.267
No, you tell me what rap is
and then I'll tell you what opera is.

29:55.444 --> 29:57.025
How about you tell me what opera is

29:57.029 --> 29:59.190
and then later on
I'll tell you what rap is?

29:59.198 --> 30:01.484
There you go. What can I do?

30:01.492 --> 30:03.699
Uh, well, you know, originally,

30:03.703 --> 30:07.115
it was people just like you
went to the opera.

30:07.122 --> 30:11.365
Casual clothes, they took food,
they took alcohol, they threw things.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.455
Anyway, that was a long time ago

30:14.462 --> 30:16.827
that rich people
took over the world of opera

30:16.839 --> 30:18.579
with their fancy dress,

30:18.590 --> 30:24.301
and they took the soul out of it -
they made it something that it's not.

30:24.304 --> 30:27.761
What is it? Uh, what is it?

30:27.765 --> 30:29.551
Would you wait for me, Cissy, dear?

30:29.559 --> 30:31.390
What? Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm so excited.

30:31.394 --> 30:34.852
Even I... even I... I've woken up
with the black dog on my shoulder

30:34.856 --> 30:37.767
from time to time,
and it doesn't last for long.

30:37.774 --> 30:42.063
You see, how could it? Because everyone
here looks after each other and...

30:42.237 --> 30:45.149
Make up your mind, dear, please.

30:45.157 --> 30:47.989
And there's so much to enjoy here -
people coming and going,

30:47.992 --> 30:50.859
new faces, old friends, new hobbies.

30:50.870 --> 30:52.952
- What's that dreadful noise?

30:52.955 --> 30:55.162
I'm meant to be in there.

30:57.876 --> 31:02.165
Side to side, basic.
Cissy, you're missing my class.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.919
Come in, darling.

31:08.218 --> 31:10.129
Forward and back.

31:11.805 --> 31:14.467
Nice, hips, move those hips.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.685
Side to side now. Shake it, ladies.
Shake it.

31:24.692 --> 31:27.525
This is not a retirement home -
this is a madhouse.

31:28.613 --> 31:29.647
God.

31:31.448 --> 31:32.984
Hello.

31:38.789 --> 31:41.700
Jean? Jean?

31:43.626 --> 31:46.584
Birthday benefit gala,
emergency, top secret.

31:48.130 --> 31:51.212
- Jean.
- Didn't that used to be Bobby Swanson?

31:51.216 --> 31:53.332
- Yes.
- Well, he didn't seem to recognise me.

31:53.343 --> 31:54.879
Isn't that odd?

31:54.886 --> 31:57.502
'Birthday benefit gala,
emergency, top secret'.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.091
Oh, whose birthday?
Mine isn't till January 6.

32:00.098 --> 32:03.135
No, no, no. Not yours, darling, no.
No, Verdi's birthday.

32:03.143 --> 32:05.930
There's a benefit gala
and we're all expected to perform.

32:05.938 --> 32:09.351
- Wha? Perform?
- Yes, we all do... what we do.

32:09.358 --> 32:10.972
At our age? That's ridiculous.

32:10.983 --> 32:13.690
No, it isn't.
Everybody can do something.

32:13.694 --> 32:17.027
Well, I'm not singing at Verdi's gala
or anybody else's.

32:17.031 --> 32:19.443
I don't sing anymore, and that is final.

32:19.450 --> 32:21.986
Jean, I was listening
to our Rigoletto this morning,

32:22.160 --> 32:23.696
and we were all so good,

32:23.703 --> 32:28.072
but... Jean, your Gilda,
it was magnificent.

32:28.083 --> 32:29.698
Yes, I know.

32:29.709 --> 32:33.542
I know. I never took
less than twelve curtain calls. Never.

32:35.381 --> 32:37.212
Where is Reggie?

32:37.216 --> 32:39.798
Um... I think he's round here.

32:39.802 --> 32:44.295
Opera is, when a guy
is stabbed in the back,

32:44.305 --> 32:47.889
instead of bleeding, he sings.

32:48.059 --> 32:51.176
But it seems to me, after much research,

32:51.187 --> 32:55.475
that rap is,
when a guy is stabbed in the back,

32:55.482 --> 32:59.646
instead of bleeding, he talks - albeit
rhythmically, even with feeling.

32:59.653 --> 33:06.114
But because rap's spoken, the feeling is
sort of held in check, all on one note.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.608
I think he's in here. This is the...

33:08.619 --> 33:10.826
No, no, no, no.
This is the little music room.

33:10.830 --> 33:13.536
This is the little m...
He'll be in the big music room

33:13.540 --> 33:16.282
because that's where they
do all the big lectures, in here.

33:16.459 --> 33:18.165
- Yes.
- No, Cissy, don't.

33:18.169 --> 33:20.831
- He'll be thrilled to see you.
- Don't.

33:20.839 --> 33:23.545
In opera, we sing what we're feeling,

33:23.549 --> 33:27.792
and the song,
the rise and fall of the music,

33:27.803 --> 33:31.387
sets our emotions free.

33:31.390 --> 33:35.052
If you ask me, I'd say to you that opera

33:35.059 --> 33:40.599
is simply the outpouring
of all the emotions

33:40.607 --> 33:43.440
that all of us carry inside us.

33:43.610 --> 33:47.397
Now, Joey, I think it's your turn.

33:47.404 --> 33:48.940
Show him what you can do.

33:48.947 --> 33:50.938
- Oh, he can actually do rap.
- He's good.

33:50.949 --> 33:52.689
- Come on.
- Alright.

33:52.701 --> 33:55.032
Opera's where you sing your arse on stage

33:55.036 --> 33:57.322
Rap is where you're trying to get your arse paid

33:57.330 --> 33:59.537
You're talking horny, but we get laid

33:59.540 --> 34:01.656
We can't help what we talk about

34:01.667 --> 34:03.874
We just talk and you sing it out

34:03.878 --> 34:05.868
Opera make you feel the pain too

34:06.046 --> 34:08.081
We wake up, we're 16 years old

34:08.089 --> 34:10.545
We look outside, the sky stays cold

34:10.550 --> 34:13.337
See, there's pain in my heart

34:13.344 --> 34:15.505
And every day I wake up, and it's damaged

34:15.512 --> 34:17.422
But opera, you sing it out loud

34:17.431 --> 34:19.592
Get stabbed in the back, you seem to manage

34:19.600 --> 34:23.809
Everybody thinks that opera and rap
are two completely different things

34:23.812 --> 34:25.847
But it's just talking, for us

34:25.855 --> 34:27.937
And for you, it's just the way that you sing

34:27.940 --> 34:29.931
And everybody knows how we do it, homes

34:29.943 --> 34:31.978
'Cause the sky...

34:31.985 --> 34:34.398
- I don't know, whatever, man...
- Fantastic.

34:38.158 --> 34:41.696
Thank you, Joey. Now,
uh, very good, it's going very well.

34:41.703 --> 34:43.409
Don't go away.

34:43.413 --> 34:46.199
Um, we're going to, uh...

34:46.208 --> 34:48.414
Uh, yes, come in.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.373
It's us.

34:59.010 --> 35:00.591
Can I help you?

35:12.690 --> 35:14.226
Where was I?

35:18.569 --> 35:21.902
Rigoletto is, uh...

35:23.074 --> 35:26.612
...one of Verdi's, uh, masterpieces.

35:26.786 --> 35:29.367
It's about infidelity.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.490
- No. No...
- Ah, Reggie, how'd the talk go?

35:37.462 --> 35:39.167
Um...

35:40.297 --> 35:42.083
Reggie?

36:26.882 --> 36:30.090
Jean, shall we just sit for a while?

36:30.093 --> 36:32.128
I don't care what we do, really.

36:32.303 --> 36:35.716
Oh! Nobby really ought to
have a go at this pond.

36:35.723 --> 36:37.759
Ugh, it's filthy.

36:39.018 --> 36:40.678
Here we are.

36:42.062 --> 36:46.021
There's Olly. Daisy! Daisy-Jo!

36:47.067 --> 36:48.807
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

36:48.818 --> 36:51.684
Look at you!

36:51.695 --> 36:54.186
Give me a hug! Mmmm!

36:55.240 --> 36:57.731
- This is my friend Jean.
- Hello, Jean.

36:57.743 --> 36:59.449
Uh, which hand?

37:00.579 --> 37:02.159
That one.

37:02.163 --> 37:03.528
Yes!

37:03.706 --> 37:06.038
Daisy! It's time to go home.

37:06.042 --> 37:07.828
Off you go. Say goodbye.

37:07.835 --> 37:09.826
- Goodbye, Cissy.
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.

37:09.837 --> 37:12.919
- What's your name again?
- Jean.

37:13.090 --> 37:14.751
Bye, Jean.

37:16.593 --> 37:18.129
Bye.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.052
Mm...

37:23.349 --> 37:25.635
Must be lovely to have visitors,
like family.

37:26.852 --> 37:28.683
Will you, Jean, have visitors?

37:29.730 --> 37:32.687
- The grounds are nice.
- Yes. Yes.

37:36.611 --> 37:39.648
I'm not like you, Wilf -
I positively liked getting old.

37:39.656 --> 37:42.068
I think I can say
that I made the transition

37:42.075 --> 37:45.191
from opera singer to old fart
with aplomb.

37:45.369 --> 37:48.611
And then Jean arrives
and shatters everything.

37:48.622 --> 37:51.864
You know, I remember thinking
about you when you got married...

37:52.042 --> 37:54.453
She was always
much more ambitious than you.

37:54.460 --> 37:57.418
Of course she was.
She was more ambitious than everyone.

37:57.421 --> 37:59.161
If I know anything about it...

37:59.173 --> 38:01.960
- What can you know about it?
- I was your best man.

38:01.968 --> 38:05.551
Yeah, of course you were. But you were
married to the same woman for 35 years.

38:05.554 --> 38:07.169
Call me old-fashioned, Wilf,

38:07.180 --> 38:10.388
but did she know you were unfaithful
to her God knows how many times?

38:11.768 --> 38:14.383
You say some very harsh things, Reg.

38:14.562 --> 38:16.393
I think I'll have myself a widdle.

38:20.818 --> 38:24.401
And you were right, you know -
I do hate getting older.

38:24.404 --> 38:26.440
I hate every bloody moment of it.

38:26.447 --> 38:30.486
If it isn't piles, it's bloody prostate

38:30.493 --> 38:34.406
or peeing five times a night,
if you're lucky.

38:38.083 --> 38:41.416
Ah! Ladies!

38:41.420 --> 38:44.332
You may want to avert your gaze.

38:44.506 --> 38:49.340
A wise man goes when he can,
a fool goes when he must.

38:49.343 --> 38:51.584
Look, here's Jean in all her glory.

38:51.596 --> 38:55.713
Oh, Jean. You haven't changed a jot.

38:55.724 --> 38:59.216
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say
she still looks like a young girl?

38:59.227 --> 39:01.764
Reggie? Don't I get a kiss?

39:02.981 --> 39:04.517
Reg?

39:05.650 --> 39:08.311
I apologise for hurting you.

39:08.319 --> 39:11.527
Please... be kind to me.

39:11.530 --> 39:13.862
We were different people then.

39:14.909 --> 39:19.197
There, I've... I've been
rehearsing that all the past week.

39:19.370 --> 39:21.861
He's upset because he wasn't warned
you were coming.

39:21.873 --> 39:23.409
I'm not upset.

39:24.626 --> 39:26.537
Oh, Reg.

39:26.544 --> 39:31.458
This is the first time we've seen each
other in God knows how many years.

39:31.465 --> 39:35.003
- '97.
- Is it really that long?

39:35.010 --> 39:37.250
God. How time flies.

39:38.387 --> 39:40.093
Oh... A joke!

39:40.097 --> 39:42.088
Cissy!

39:42.099 --> 39:46.263
Bobby, give us a clue, for God's sake.
Is it a book, a film, a play?

39:46.437 --> 39:49.644
Cissy. The note?

39:49.648 --> 39:51.559
I couldn't read your writing.

39:51.566 --> 39:54.182
Meeting, now.

39:54.194 --> 39:56.685
Oh, God. The emergency meeting.

39:56.696 --> 39:59.607
- I wonder what that was all about.
- Where's Reg? Where's Reg?

40:02.493 --> 40:04.108
Reg!

40:34.230 --> 40:35.766
Reg?

40:39.693 --> 40:41.399
Reggie?

40:45.907 --> 40:47.943
Reg, are you in here?

40:54.081 --> 40:56.914
Oh. There you are.

40:57.084 --> 40:59.075
What you doing there?

41:00.129 --> 41:01.664
Leave me in peace, Jean.

41:01.671 --> 41:05.459
God... Oh, dear,
I've walked miles to find you.

41:05.466 --> 41:07.047
Leave me in peace.

41:09.053 --> 41:10.588
Reggie?

41:11.930 --> 41:13.921
Leave!

41:41.999 --> 41:43.785
Can't ever remember you crying.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.408
I don't remember you being religious.

41:46.587 --> 41:50.171
I'm not. I was trying to avoid you.

41:51.216 --> 41:53.957
I apologise for hurting you.
Please be kind.

41:53.968 --> 41:56.926
- We were different people then.
- No, you just said that, Jean.

41:56.929 --> 41:58.590
You're repeating yourself.

42:00.016 --> 42:01.552
Oh, God.

42:02.601 --> 42:04.887
Why do we have to get old?

42:04.895 --> 42:06.760
That's what people do.

42:09.941 --> 42:11.977
We have to come to some arrangement.

42:11.985 --> 42:14.896
I don't want to talk about it.
You're here. I'm here. Trapped.

42:14.904 --> 42:16.690
So what are we going to do?

42:16.697 --> 42:18.358
Grin and bear it.

42:19.658 --> 42:21.398
What happened to forgive and forget?

42:32.754 --> 42:34.414
This cologne...

42:35.756 --> 42:37.462
...takes me back.

42:41.637 --> 42:43.593
It takes me back to you, Reg.

43:24.008 --> 43:27.340
- It's flat.
- I know.

43:27.344 --> 43:29.585
Are there any other pianos?

43:29.596 --> 43:32.463
We will make sure
you get a better one next time, alright?

43:32.641 --> 43:34.927
Have a little go, see how you get on.

43:34.935 --> 43:36.470
OK.

44:05.129 --> 44:06.665
Esme.

44:08.465 --> 44:10.001
Thank you.

44:10.008 --> 44:14.092
- Hello. My name's Isla Mathieson.
- Hello. My name's lona Mathieson.

44:14.095 --> 44:16.336
- And we'll be playing...
- Go Tell Aunt Rhody.

45:28.162 --> 45:29.823
Would you like to go for a walk?

45:55.520 --> 45:57.385
Were you married four or five times?

45:57.397 --> 45:59.809
I was only married twice.

45:59.983 --> 46:01.643
After you.

46:02.734 --> 46:04.474
Charlie Tripper.

46:05.737 --> 46:07.443
He was a businessman.

46:08.574 --> 46:11.906
Mixed pleasure with business
rather too often.

46:11.909 --> 46:13.649
And Edward...

46:15.955 --> 46:18.321
- Fitzroy.
- Yeah.

46:18.499 --> 46:23.083
Yeah. He wanted me to retire, have
a family, so that was the end of that.

46:27.340 --> 46:29.752
- You never married again?
- No.

46:31.928 --> 46:33.588
- Why not?
- Didn't want to.

46:37.725 --> 46:40.683
When we did BohÃ¨me at the Met
and you backed out,

46:40.686 --> 46:42.222
was that because of me?

46:42.229 --> 46:43.764
Yep.

46:43.771 --> 46:45.682
- And Salzburg?
- Yep.

46:48.026 --> 46:49.687
Oh.

46:57.075 --> 46:58.736
What brought you here?

46:58.910 --> 47:01.447
Um... actually Wilf was ill.

47:01.455 --> 47:03.991
He had a stroke, didn't he?

47:03.998 --> 47:05.954
Yes, it was only a mild one, thankfully.

47:05.958 --> 47:08.791
It's affected
his, um... his frontal lobe

47:08.794 --> 47:11.126
and he has trouble censoring himself.

47:11.130 --> 47:13.086
Is that it?

47:13.257 --> 47:14.962
Well, so he says.

47:14.966 --> 47:17.878
So I came here
to see how Wilf was getting on.

47:18.970 --> 47:20.710
- And stayed.
- Mm.

47:22.474 --> 47:26.432
I loved singing. But I like my life.

47:26.435 --> 47:29.893
You can't have both. Can you?

47:32.274 --> 47:34.014
- No.
- No.

47:35.818 --> 47:37.433
No, you can't.

47:40.698 --> 47:42.484
I've nothing.

47:42.492 --> 47:45.779
Well, my clothes, bit of jewellery

47:45.786 --> 47:47.993
and a hip that gives me hell.

47:48.330 --> 47:50.946
- And here you are.
- Yeah, here I am.

47:50.957 --> 47:53.369
On charity. God, it's embarrassing.

47:54.461 --> 47:56.542
I wouldn't tell anyone.

47:56.545 --> 47:58.911
I mean, the press
have always been mean to me.

47:59.090 --> 48:03.299
If they learned I'd landed up here,
God, how they'd gloat.

48:03.302 --> 48:05.384
Do the press still have
any interest in you?

48:05.388 --> 48:06.923
- Oh!
- Ow.

48:06.930 --> 48:08.921
Piss off, Reg.

48:08.932 --> 48:11.639
W... Bitch!

48:11.810 --> 48:13.892
There she goes. See her?

48:13.895 --> 48:15.760
Angelique. Bitch!

48:15.772 --> 48:19.138
Cow! Sodding frog!

48:19.149 --> 48:21.231
She won't give me marmalade
at breakfast.

48:21.235 --> 48:22.975
She gives me apricot jam.

48:23.153 --> 48:26.566
- Oh. You hate apricot jam.
- Bitch!

48:26.573 --> 48:29.814
- Skinny-arsed French twat.
- Shh.

48:29.826 --> 48:31.737
Stop it, Reggie.

48:37.916 --> 48:41.534
So, Jean, what made you stop singing?

48:41.545 --> 48:44.878
- You mean for good?
- Yes, for good.

48:46.049 --> 48:50.883
I just became so scared.
Suddenly, the pressure was huge.

48:50.886 --> 48:53.502
I became so aware of the critics,

48:53.514 --> 48:56.381
and the importance
of getting a good review,

48:56.392 --> 49:01.602
that whatever you did had to be good,
or, well, better than before.

49:03.648 --> 49:05.309
And of course it can't be.

49:06.568 --> 49:10.776
I got so nervous, I just...
I just could not sing anymore.

49:10.946 --> 49:13.858
- I just...
- Here. You know this?

49:18.120 --> 49:21.486
'Works of art
are of an infinite loneliness,

49:21.497 --> 49:24.489
and nothing... '

49:24.500 --> 49:28.914
'... can reach them so little
as criticism. '

49:43.350 --> 49:44.931
We weren't doing anything.

49:46.187 --> 49:47.597
Neither were we.

49:50.800 --> 49:51.935
Can you find us somewhere?

49:54.152 --> 49:55.733
Where is she - Cissy? Where is she?

49:55.737 --> 49:57.819
- She will be here.
- Excuse me!

49:57.822 --> 50:00.063
Are you planning to do this at the gala?

50:00.074 --> 50:01.108
Certainly!

50:01.116 --> 50:04.233
Well, I've changed my mind.
I don't think it's sophisticated enough.

50:04.411 --> 50:06.697
What do you mean
it isn't sophisticated enough?

50:06.705 --> 50:10.038
- Exactly what I say. What did I say?
- 'It's not sophisticated enough'.

50:10.042 --> 50:12.202
- There you are.
Well, we are gonna do it.

50:16.214 --> 50:17.750
We started half an hour ago.

50:17.757 --> 50:19.372
- You're late.
- I had to get my bag.

50:19.383 --> 50:21.748
Have you asked Reggie
to sing that Donna Ã¨ Mobile?

50:21.927 --> 50:24.384
- God. No, I forgot.
- Good. Don't.

50:24.387 --> 50:26.844
I have a brilliant idea!

50:26.848 --> 50:28.429
What is it?

50:28.433 --> 50:31.549
Oh, I've forgotten it. Um... er...
You remember it. What was that?

50:31.560 --> 50:33.801
- You haven't said it yet.
- I told you this morning.

50:33.813 --> 50:35.849
- No, you didn't.
- I told you at breakfast!

50:35.856 --> 50:37.471
- You didn't.
- And you. I've told you.

50:37.650 --> 50:39.857
You were sitting outside with us.
What is it?

50:39.860 --> 50:43.602
You must know...
Oh, for God's sake, you cretins.

50:43.613 --> 50:47.322
I'll find it eventually.
Go and find Wilf. Go on.

50:47.325 --> 50:49.657
Now, where was I?

50:49.661 --> 50:51.322
Who?

50:51.496 --> 50:53.076
Wilf!

50:53.080 --> 50:55.947
Tit-Willow

50:55.958 --> 50:59.542
The reason I've asked you here
is because I've had a brilliant idea.

50:59.545 --> 51:02.161
Excuse me while I shut out Tit-Willow,
Cedric.

51:02.339 --> 51:05.205
'Cee-dric'. A brilliant idea.

51:05.216 --> 51:06.877
Terrific. I can explain to you now.

51:06.884 --> 51:08.875
I'm sorry,
I missed that last bit, Cedric.

51:08.886 --> 51:11.377
- 'Cee-dric'.
- Oh, Cee-dric. Of course, of course.

51:11.389 --> 51:14.300
Now that Jean is here
and the four of you are together again,

51:14.307 --> 51:17.549
I put it to you
that you should perform at the gala

51:17.561 --> 51:19.597
the quartet from Rigoletto.

51:19.604 --> 51:22.767
That's amazing!
I've... I've just been listening to us.

51:22.774 --> 51:25.765
- The Rigoletto.
Think of the publicity!

51:25.776 --> 51:28.233
The Times, The Telegraph,
Opera Magazine.

51:28.237 --> 51:32.321
We have four of the finest singers
in English operatic history.

51:32.491 --> 51:35.482
We already know the bloody thing.
We'd hardly have to rehearse.

51:35.493 --> 51:37.575
- But Jean won't sing it.
- Put your hand up.

51:37.579 --> 51:40.491
Put your hand up?
- Oh, but you must change her mind.

51:40.498 --> 51:42.034
She's a huge draw.

51:42.041 --> 51:44.032
Don't you put your hand up for anyone.

51:44.043 --> 51:46.374
It would be as if Maria Callas
were making a comeback.

51:46.545 --> 51:48.627
I don't think
I want to sing with Jean again.

51:48.630 --> 51:49.710
Why not?

51:49.715 --> 51:52.001
They were married once,
but it didn't work out.

51:52.009 --> 51:54.500
Cissy, please. I don't want to.
It wouldn't be right.

51:54.511 --> 51:56.501
Well, it's a shame.

51:56.512 --> 51:59.595
I can't count the number of galas
you have graced over the years

51:59.599 --> 52:02.215
with your incomparable voice -
and I mean that sincerely.

52:02.393 --> 52:04.133
I don't think you realise it, Reggie,

52:04.145 --> 52:07.602
but people still talk about
your Celeste Aida four years ago

52:07.606 --> 52:09.437
and your Ave Maria two years ago.

52:09.441 --> 52:11.056
For what it's worth,

52:11.067 --> 52:15.026
when I heard you sing Nessun Dorma
at the gala last year,

52:15.030 --> 52:18.738
all I thought was,
'Eat your heart out, Pavarotti. '

52:18.908 --> 52:21.274
Reggie, I know you
don't think much of me,

52:21.285 --> 52:25.244
but with this one concert, we could get
enough money to keep this place going

52:25.247 --> 52:26.827
for the rest of the year.

52:26.831 --> 52:28.992
- Or possibly even the next.
It's true.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.992
You could help save Beecham House,
Reginald.

52:32.003 --> 52:35.166
But I have an important meeting now.
Do excuse me.

52:36.400 --> 52:39.040
- Oh, shut up! For... sakes, shut up!

52:39.051 --> 52:41.667
And you could persuade Jean to sing.

52:41.678 --> 52:44.010
It's only one gala, Reggie.

52:46.058 --> 52:49.015
Why don't the three of us
ask her out to dinner?

52:49.185 --> 52:51.892
- Well done, Reggie.
- Oh, Reggie!

52:51.896 --> 52:53.636
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

52:53.648 --> 52:56.606
No, I'll, uh...
I'll write her a little note, Cissy,

52:56.609 --> 52:59.520
and perhaps you will be good enough
to deliver it.

52:59.527 --> 53:01.063
Yes.

53:10.371 --> 53:11.907
Sorry.

53:16.335 --> 53:18.916
- Just two favours.
- Exactly what do you propose?

53:19.087 --> 53:22.830
The Swan restaurant. Just
the four of us - Cissy, Reggie and me.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.081
If we could convince Jean
to sing at the gala,

53:25.093 --> 53:27.505
we're talking serious money here.

53:27.512 --> 53:31.095
I mean, even Cedric reckons
we could charge Covent Garden prices.

53:31.098 --> 53:32.963
In by 10:30. No later.

53:32.975 --> 53:34.715
- 12:30.
- No.

53:34.726 --> 53:36.387
- You sure?
- Yes.

53:36.395 --> 53:38.726
What kind of cigarettes
is it you smoke again?

53:45.361 --> 53:47.818
- 12:30. No later.
- Done, Lucy.

53:47.822 --> 53:50.187
- Please call me Dr Cogan.
- Done, Dr Cogan.

53:50.198 --> 53:53.190
Why is it, Wilfred, I always get the
impression you're up to no good?

53:53.368 --> 53:55.029
Because I'm normally up to no good.

53:55.036 --> 53:56.572
And please, call me Wilf.

53:56.579 --> 53:59.241
We've done this, remember?
You don't have a buttonhole.

54:00.457 --> 54:04.200
Why do you persist
in flirting with me, Wilf?

54:04.211 --> 54:07.954
Because you're a cracker,
a thing of beauty.

54:08.132 --> 54:11.623
You're not a bimbo or a chick
or any of those awful things.

54:11.634 --> 54:17.095
You're one of that rarest of species -
you're a woman, Lucy Cogan.

54:17.098 --> 54:20.180
Well, I'm flattered, but I have
professional ethics to uphold.

54:20.183 --> 54:23.095
Ah, throw caution to the wind.

54:23.103 --> 54:27.016
What if we were
to make beautiful music together?

54:27.024 --> 54:28.889
Your husband would never know.

54:28.900 --> 54:30.639
That's reassuring, Wilf.

54:30.818 --> 54:33.059
- Think about it, huh?
- No, Wilf.

54:33.070 --> 54:36.187
- No-one would ever know.
- I will know, Wilf.

54:36.198 --> 54:40.441
Older man. Vintage wine. Seasoned wood.

54:41.661 --> 54:44.323
- Did you say wood?
- Seasoned.

54:58.761 --> 55:01.548
Remember,
wait until she's totally legless

55:01.555 --> 55:03.090
before we hit her with it.

55:03.097 --> 55:04.678
Yes. Don't speak till she's legless.

55:04.849 --> 55:06.430
- She's coming.
- Legless.

55:06.434 --> 55:09.016
- I should never have agreed to this.
- Here she comes.

55:10.772 --> 55:13.308
She looks fairly alright-ish.

55:13.315 --> 55:14.976
You look lovely, Jean.

55:14.983 --> 55:17.725
Oh. Thank you.

55:17.736 --> 55:20.193
You give a whole new meaning
to the word 'chic'.

55:20.197 --> 55:23.688
- It's so very, very kind of you.
- It's the least we can do.

55:23.699 --> 55:25.439
- May I, Jean?
- Thank you.

55:54.977 --> 55:57.719
For you, Jean, a little toast,

55:57.730 --> 56:00.563
from all of us to make you feel welcome.

56:00.566 --> 56:04.183
Oh-oh, now, don't forget you've got
to make eye contact or it's bad luck.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.818
I never heard of anything like that
in my life.

56:06.822 --> 56:08.653
- It's the truth.
- Nonsense.

56:10.700 --> 56:13.112
Jean, do you ever
listen to your old recordings?

56:13.120 --> 56:14.780
- Oh, no. No.
- I do.

56:14.787 --> 56:16.323
I listen to us a lot.

56:16.497 --> 56:18.488
As a matter of fact,

56:18.499 --> 56:20.911
Reggie was meant
to be singing La Donna Ã¨ Mobile

56:20.918 --> 56:22.454
at the gala concert.

56:22.461 --> 56:24.951
- But even more exciting, guess what?
- Shh, shh, shh.

56:26.214 --> 56:27.294
What?

56:27.298 --> 56:29.539
La donna Ã¨ mobile. Qual piuma al vento.

56:29.551 --> 56:31.758
Women are as fickle
as a feather in the wind.

56:31.928 --> 56:34.670
Oh, I fell in love with you
when I first heard you sing that.

56:34.681 --> 56:36.545
Yeah, that's why I never sang it again.

56:37.599 --> 56:39.135
I took twelve curtain calls.

56:39.143 --> 56:40.849
No. No, you took nine. I took twelve.

56:42.771 --> 56:44.477
- Stop.
- If you say so.

56:44.648 --> 56:46.228
You know, the other night

56:46.232 --> 56:48.894
I was at the Garden,
I was Sir George's guest,

56:48.901 --> 56:51.017
and I received a standing ovation.

56:51.028 --> 56:53.644
Oh, how lovely!

56:53.656 --> 56:55.237
You're doing it again, Jean.

56:55.241 --> 56:57.606
- Doing what?
- Repeating yourself.

56:57.617 --> 56:59.153
Oh, what's it matter.

56:59.161 --> 57:02.369
In opera we repeat ourselves
all the time, all the time, all the...

57:02.372 --> 57:04.363
In opera we repeat ourselves
all the time,

57:04.374 --> 57:07.035
...repeat ourselves over and over...
- Repetito...

57:07.042 --> 57:08.578
I think you two are drunk.

57:08.586 --> 57:10.122
I think I possibly am,

57:10.129 --> 57:13.292
although I find it very difficult
to tell the difference at this age.

57:13.299 --> 57:15.881
- You always drink.
- Let's have a toast to our quartet.

57:15.885 --> 57:18.591
- To the quartet.
- What quartet?

57:18.761 --> 57:21.753
Cedric wants us all
to sing in the gala concert.

57:21.764 --> 57:23.925
What, us to sing?

57:23.933 --> 57:25.469
He wants us to sing...

57:25.476 --> 57:28.262
The quartet from Rigoletto.

57:28.270 --> 57:29.601
It's such an honour.

57:29.813 --> 57:31.349
It's a great honour, Jean.

57:32.649 --> 57:35.061
- Great honour.
- Very great honour.

57:36.320 --> 57:37.855
The quartet?

57:39.071 --> 57:40.607
Is that why you're?

57:40.615 --> 57:42.571
I don't want any of this, please.
Please.

57:42.575 --> 57:44.440
Is that why
you asked me for this dinner?

57:44.619 --> 57:46.826
No. We asked you because...

57:46.829 --> 57:48.864
- Well...
- Why?

57:48.872 --> 57:51.534
- Because we love you.
- Aye. Yeah.

57:59.089 --> 58:01.455
Well, I'm not singing in any quartet.

58:03.969 --> 58:06.756
I think you really are despicable.

58:14.771 --> 58:16.307
Phew!

58:17.482 --> 58:19.017
Did she say yes?

58:19.024 --> 58:20.639
No.

58:27.658 --> 58:30.239
Caro Nome

59:44.143 --> 59:45.679
Excuse me.

59:45.686 --> 59:47.222
Let me ask you something.

59:47.229 --> 59:48.935
When did you last sing?

59:49.106 --> 59:50.642
This morning in the shower?

59:51.692 --> 59:53.647
Has anybody heard you recently?

59:53.651 --> 59:56.939
Any idea of the noise you make?

59:56.946 --> 59:59.858
I mean, what were you thinking of?
Why did you ask me out to dinner?

01:00:00.033 --> 01:00:03.866
Why didn't you just say you want us -
average age, what, 198-

01:00:03.869 --> 01:00:06.986
to sing the quartet from Rigoletto?

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.247
'It's an honour. ' It's not an honour.

01:00:11.752 --> 01:00:13.287
It's insanity.

01:00:15.463 --> 01:00:17.624
Is this your idea of revenge?

01:00:18.924 --> 01:00:22.291
I'm going to say something
very rude to you.

01:00:23.845 --> 01:00:25.381
Fuck you.

01:00:32.604 --> 01:00:34.139
And you.

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:45.736
Can't believe it.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.401
Can you believe that bitch?

01:00:53.456 --> 01:00:55.741
Oh, my God. It's Olly!

01:01:07.259 --> 01:01:09.420
Dwayne. Olly's been taken ill.

01:01:09.428 --> 01:01:11.168
I'm going to explain to everybody...

01:01:13.224 --> 01:01:14.555
Morning.

01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:18.843
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

01:01:18.853 --> 01:01:20.889
Sorry to interrupt your breakfast.

01:01:21.064 --> 01:01:24.727
Er... it seems
that Olly Fisher is unwell.

01:01:24.734 --> 01:01:26.439
It's his recurring condition,

01:01:26.443 --> 01:01:28.809
but he is in the safest hands.

01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:31.312
I want to reassure you
he's on his way to hospital

01:01:31.323 --> 01:01:34.110
and he's gonna be absolutely OK.
He's going for a check-up.

01:01:34.118 --> 01:01:36.234
Dr Cogan, he is still conscious,
isn't he?

01:01:36.245 --> 01:01:38.235
He's fully conscious, Norma, yes.

01:01:38.246 --> 01:01:40.362
And he wouldn't
want any of us worrying, now.

01:01:40.373 --> 01:01:43.706
Would he?
So, you just enjoy your breakfast, OK?

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.585
With everything in life,

01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:52.080
I'd just like to ask you one question.

01:01:52.259 --> 01:01:55.843
Why, you silly so and so

01:03:02.572 --> 01:03:04.483
Go away.

01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:06.106
Jean?

01:03:06.117 --> 01:03:09.075
- It's me, Cissy.
- Just go away, Cissy, please.

01:03:09.078 --> 01:03:11.910
L- I know you're upset,
so I brought you some flowers

01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:13.450
and I picked them myself.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.993
Aren't they lovely? Look.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.865
I thought these
might really cheer you up.

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:19.660
And Nobby doesn't
usually allow us to pick any flowers,

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:22.537
and especially not the ones
in the woodland, not even those.

01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:26.132
And I really wanted to get you bluebells
because I know you love bluebells.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.921
Because we talked about them before.

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:31.170
But I wondered also, would you like
to talk about the quartet?

01:03:31.348 --> 01:03:34.260
No! I would not like
to talk about the quartet!

01:03:34.267 --> 01:03:35.848
- Oh!
- Get out!

01:03:38.313 --> 01:03:40.349
Why did she do that?
Why did she do that?

01:03:40.524 --> 01:03:42.184
Ahhh!

01:04:26.856 --> 01:04:28.687
Is this my house?

01:04:28.692 --> 01:04:30.853
It's a lovely place.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.225
This is Beecham House.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.102
It's not your room. It's another room.

01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:39.274
You've come here to have a rest, Cissy.

01:04:41.954 --> 01:04:43.944
You're... you're...

01:04:43.955 --> 01:04:45.536
...my friend.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.905
Sheryl.

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:48.577
Sheryl. Yes.

01:04:49.627 --> 01:04:51.618
- Sheryl.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:51.629 --> 01:04:53.165
And this is?

01:04:58.927 --> 01:05:00.588
Reggie.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.886
And, of course,

01:05:07.893 --> 01:05:10.885
this is a naughty, naughty man.

01:05:11.063 --> 01:05:12.599
Hi, Cissy.

01:05:12.607 --> 01:05:14.597
Where's... where's...

01:05:14.608 --> 01:05:16.223
...where's my, um...

01:05:16.234 --> 01:05:18.395
Where's my... my thing?

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:20.106
I got your bag here, Cissy.

01:05:22.032 --> 01:05:23.943
That's my bag.

01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:27.150
- This is my...
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:28.776
Yes.

01:05:30.331 --> 01:05:31.571
See?

01:05:31.749 --> 01:05:33.285
- That's mine.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:37.250
- And what were you listening to?
- Mmm...

01:05:37.253 --> 01:05:38.789
What's that?

01:05:38.796 --> 01:05:42.288
Cissy... this is our quartet.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.133
You... you've been listening to us.

01:05:45.136 --> 01:05:47.296
It's new. It's new.

01:05:47.304 --> 01:05:48.840
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

01:05:48.847 --> 01:05:50.508
- This is...
- The one they re-issued.

01:05:50.682 --> 01:05:53.765
This is new. Yep. That's mine.

01:05:57.938 --> 01:06:01.726
Wilf... Wilf, that's...

01:06:01.734 --> 01:06:03.270
...that's my swimming costume.

01:06:03.277 --> 01:06:04.938
It certainly is, Cissy.

01:06:04.945 --> 01:06:06.525
- Mmm.
- Yes.

01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:09.108
Yes.

01:06:21.502 --> 01:06:25.370
This... this place is a concept for me.

01:06:25.547 --> 01:06:29.835
Because I've got no husband
and no children.

01:06:29.842 --> 01:06:32.504
I've got you.

01:06:32.512 --> 01:06:35.094
- Mm.
- Indeed you have, Cissy.

01:06:35.098 --> 01:06:36.634
All of you.

01:06:44.731 --> 01:06:46.392
I think she should get some rest.

01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:50.687
Lovely girl.

01:06:51.987 --> 01:06:53.523
Beautifully endowed.

01:06:59.285 --> 01:07:01.822
- Have you seen Cissy?
- Yes.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.366
How is she?

01:07:03.373 --> 01:07:04.909
- She's...
- Fine.

01:07:29.188 --> 01:07:30.893
I'll come back in the morning.

01:07:30.897 --> 01:07:32.262
Yes, of course, Ms Horton.

01:07:32.441 --> 01:07:34.523
You be sure
to tell her I came to see her.

01:07:34.526 --> 01:07:35.561
Absolutely.

01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:37.275
Jean, is that you?

01:07:37.279 --> 01:07:39.645
I thought I recognised your voice.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:41.191
As if one couldn't.

01:07:42.283 --> 01:07:43.819
Frank?

01:07:45.035 --> 01:07:46.571
Frank White!

01:07:46.579 --> 01:07:49.366
It's nothing serious,
just one of my dizzy spells.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.621
But I won't be taking part in the gala.

01:07:51.624 --> 01:07:55.788
I had no idea you were here.
I would've come to see you earlier.

01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:59.003
Oh, dear, dear Frank.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.255
I'm sorry you're not well.

01:08:02.259 --> 01:08:04.341
What a fling we had.

01:08:07.389 --> 01:08:09.050
What a fling indeed.

01:08:09.057 --> 01:08:11.547
Short, but giving.

01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:13.095
And that beautiful hotel.

01:08:14.729 --> 01:08:16.810
- You...
- Yes.

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:19.930
You've been up to your usual tricks.

01:08:24.446 --> 01:08:25.982
Poor Cissy.

01:08:25.988 --> 01:08:28.104
I don't know what came over me.

01:08:28.283 --> 01:08:30.694
I feel so ashamed.

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:35.862
She does so want to perform the quartet.

01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:39.490
Jean.

01:08:41.545 --> 01:08:43.250
Take part.

01:08:44.296 --> 01:08:46.879
If you can't sing at the gala,

01:08:46.883 --> 01:08:48.372
do conjuring tricks.

01:08:51.679 --> 01:08:53.214
The only alternative

01:08:53.221 --> 01:08:55.304
is to be guest of honour
at the crematorium.

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:34.046
- Oh, thank you.
- There's some change, Ms Horton.

01:09:34.051 --> 01:09:36.666
No, you keep that.
Could you give this to Mr Paget?

01:09:36.678 --> 01:09:38.214
- Of course I will.
- Thank you.

01:09:39.514 --> 01:09:41.880
It's the only trio
we could come up with, Bobby.

01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:43.471
Are you sure about this, Wilfred?

01:09:43.643 --> 01:09:46.600
Well, the three of us must have
sang the Barber a dozen times.

01:09:46.603 --> 01:09:48.218
You'll need at least six sessions.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:49.765
- Six?
- Mmm.

01:09:50.858 --> 01:09:52.689
- Who's that from?
- Ms Horton.

01:09:56.612 --> 01:09:58.148
Did she say yes?

01:09:59.782 --> 01:10:02.694
Oh. How good of you to come.

01:10:03.911 --> 01:10:05.446
Please. Please sit down.

01:10:07.038 --> 01:10:08.699
Why don't you sit on the bed, Cissy?

01:10:08.707 --> 01:10:10.493
I have some little gifts for you.

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.908
First, I want to apologise,

01:10:12.919 --> 01:10:14.455
especially to you, Cissy.

01:10:15.963 --> 01:10:17.669
What I did to you was appalling,

01:10:17.673 --> 01:10:20.039
and I am... I'm so very sorry.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.586
Thank you.

01:10:21.594 --> 01:10:23.130
This is for you, Wilf.

01:10:23.137 --> 01:10:24.718
Oh, thank you.

01:10:24.722 --> 01:10:26.882
I don't even remember
you throwing flowers at me.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.136
This is for you, Reggie.

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:31.303
There.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.144
I really am very sorry.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:36.683
My fault entirely.

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:39.689
I think I know what it is.

01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:44.482
- Lime marmalade.
- A CD of our Rigoletto.

01:10:44.489 --> 01:10:46.025
How lovely.

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:49.741
Yes, I know you have copies, but these
are signed, so they're rather valuable.

01:10:49.744 --> 01:10:51.860
And I wrapped them myself.

01:10:52.038 --> 01:10:53.574
I thought perhaps you did.

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:57.198
- Well, is that it?
- Yes.

01:10:57.209 --> 01:11:00.075
This should do rather well on eBay,
I would imagine.

01:11:00.086 --> 01:11:01.872
Come on, Cissy.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.996
Have you changed your mind
about the gala?

01:11:04.007 --> 01:11:06.464
Well, of course, she hasn't.
I mean, why should she?

01:11:06.468 --> 01:11:10.210
It's only a celebration in honour of the
greatest composer for the human voice

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.632
who ever bloody lived, that's all.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.926
You must understand. I was someone once.

01:11:14.934 --> 01:11:16.515
I thought I was someone now.

01:11:16.685 --> 01:11:18.549
I can't insult the memory of who I was.

01:11:18.561 --> 01:11:20.517
What are you talking about, memory?

01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:22.102
Whose memory? Your fans?

01:11:22.106 --> 01:11:25.064
Your fans are dead!
Gone, split, bought the farm!

01:11:25.068 --> 01:11:28.435
Except the ones who've moved in here,
and they're just waiting to die.

01:11:28.446 --> 01:11:32.063
We've all aged. It's crept up
on all of us without us even noticing.

01:11:32.074 --> 01:11:34.156
I'm the same old Wilf I always was,

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:37.492
thankfully, with a little bit of
testosterone to keep me interested.

01:11:37.496 --> 01:11:40.237
Now, I'm gonna say something
that's a wee bit rude to you.

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:43.406
Just fucking do it!

01:11:45.503 --> 01:11:47.243
My gift deserted me.

01:11:47.254 --> 01:11:49.585
It deserts us all, Jean.
It's called life.

01:11:49.756 --> 01:11:52.372
Oh, my darling.
Old age is not for sissies.

01:11:52.384 --> 01:11:54.124
No.

01:11:55.971 --> 01:11:57.177
Jean?

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.841
Let go.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:01.634
What's it matter now
what anyone says or thinks?

01:12:01.642 --> 01:12:03.178
You might even enjoy it.

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:05.426
Are you telling me
to go out and smell the roses?

01:12:05.437 --> 01:12:06.973
No, I'm telling you to sing.

01:12:06.981 --> 01:12:10.063
The roses are long gone.
But the chrysanthemums are magnificent.

01:12:10.233 --> 01:12:11.814
They certainly are, Cissy.

01:12:11.818 --> 01:12:13.809
Jean, if you say yes,

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.108
Cedric will give us the finale
instead of Anne Langley.

01:12:17.115 --> 01:12:19.026
- Anne Langley?
- Yes.

01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:20.818
Yes, she wanted to sing Violetta.

01:12:20.993 --> 01:12:23.109
And she was, of course,
a very fine Violetta.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.702
Oh, pull yourself together, Cissy.

01:12:25.706 --> 01:12:28.573
Violetta's supposed
to be dying of tuberculosis.

01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:30.744
She sounded
as if she was singing Falstaff.

01:12:30.752 --> 01:12:32.287
Well, she's singing Tosca now.

01:12:37.341 --> 01:12:39.673
Over my dead body.

01:12:43.513 --> 01:12:45.094
Is that a yes?

01:13:04.574 --> 01:13:07.156
So, you decided
to sing in the gala after all.

01:13:07.326 --> 01:13:09.908
Yes, they've persuaded me
to join them in the quartet.

01:13:09.912 --> 01:13:13.449
Really? I would've thought
you would want to sing an aria, dear.

01:13:13.457 --> 01:13:15.698
No, I prefer to sing with my friends.

01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:18.041
How are your high notes nowadays?

01:13:18.045 --> 01:13:19.706
Just a little shaky, dear.

01:13:19.713 --> 01:13:21.249
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:13:21.423 --> 01:13:23.378
Now, when I sang Gilda...

01:13:23.382 --> 01:13:25.247
Yes, I heard it was a triumph.

01:13:25.259 --> 01:13:27.375
I remember my mother
telling me about it.

01:13:27.386 --> 01:13:31.129
Happy birthday to you

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:35.633
Happy birthday to you

01:13:35.643 --> 01:13:41.183
Happy birthday, dear Octavia

01:13:41.191 --> 01:13:49.939
Happy birthday to you.

01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:53.194
Speech! Speech!

01:13:53.202 --> 01:13:56.318
Now, when I play Gilda!

01:15:05.058 --> 01:15:07.594
I may crack on the high notes.

01:16:55.366 --> 01:16:57.823
And then Sir Thomas Beecham
did the same in Britain.

01:16:57.826 --> 01:16:59.441
- Hence Beecham House.
- Ladies?

01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:01.443
Lady Mayor. Sorry. Thank you.

01:17:01.621 --> 01:17:03.236
Thank you so much for coming.

01:17:03.248 --> 01:17:05.864
Ah. Hello there.

01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:08.161
Nice. Thank you. Yeah, one more.

01:17:08.169 --> 01:17:11.036
Lady Mayoress,
will you come this way, please?

01:17:17.469 --> 01:17:19.255
Well, I don't think that's...

01:17:19.263 --> 01:17:21.424
Is that going to be
too late in the day for that?

01:17:21.431 --> 01:17:25.514
I'd say something like
'Verdi's Rigoletto is a masterpiece

01:17:25.518 --> 01:17:29.352
and the quartet is one of the great
milestones in the history of opera. '

01:17:29.522 --> 01:17:31.058
Now, look at that. Perfect.

01:17:31.065 --> 01:17:33.476
And then
I'll introduce each of us in turn.

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:35.019
No, wait a minute, Reggie.

01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:36.857
- What?
- I'll go on last.

01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:38.772
I'm sure we can live with that.

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.316
We certainly can, yes.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.938
- I remember.
- What?

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:43.735
I've got to do Anne Langley's make-up.

01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:46.905
It's not make-up she needs.
It's a paper-hanging job.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:50.120
- That's very naughty, Jean.
- And very true.

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:53.707
Make it nice and tight. Make sure the
middle bit's tight so it stays that way.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:55.575
'Cause it ends up listing to starboard.

01:17:55.753 --> 01:17:57.744
No, no, no. I promise you...

01:17:57.755 --> 01:17:59.291
This too much, Reg?

01:17:59.299 --> 01:18:01.335
Do you think it's too much?

01:18:01.342 --> 01:18:02.957
No, no. Lovely.

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:05.084
Well, I don't think it'll work.

01:18:05.095 --> 01:18:06.881
I do.

01:18:10.183 --> 01:18:11.719
Hello, good afternoon.

01:18:11.727 --> 01:18:13.717
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:13.728 --> 01:18:15.639
Welcome to Beecham House

01:18:15.646 --> 01:18:18.854
and our annual gala
in honour of Giuseppe Verdi's birthday.

01:18:19.025 --> 01:18:21.812
First of all, I would like
to express our debt of gratitude

01:18:21.819 --> 01:18:25.310
to the amazing Mr Cedric Livingstone
for organising the event.

01:18:25.322 --> 01:18:27.358
Thank you so much.

01:18:27.365 --> 01:18:29.481
Thank you,
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:29.492 --> 01:18:31.357
Let me just say, in all modesty,

01:18:31.369 --> 01:18:35.202
that all great artists
need a great director, you know.

01:18:35.205 --> 01:18:36.786
And I... Here I am.

01:18:36.957 --> 01:18:39.494
Well said!

01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:41.583
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:18:43.005 --> 01:18:44.211
Thank you.

01:18:44.214 --> 01:18:46.670
This year,
in aid of our rebuilding program,

01:18:46.674 --> 01:18:48.289
you have all given so generously,

01:18:48.301 --> 01:18:50.417
and we thank you for that
with all our hearts.

01:18:50.595 --> 01:18:53.428
And, because of that,
the quartet and you have done it -

01:18:53.431 --> 01:18:55.261
Beecham House lives on!

01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:09.563
I'd also like to thank all those
taking part in the gala itself.

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:11.435
The preparations and rehearsals

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.483
have kept everybody busy
and very excited

01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:14.822
for the past few months.

01:19:15.034 --> 01:19:18.821
I and all my staff here
feel highly privileged

01:19:18.828 --> 01:19:22.070
to have in our care
such talented performers,

01:19:22.082 --> 01:19:25.199
gifted musicians
who seem to find renewed energy

01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:27.791
when they anticipate
performing before an audience.

01:19:27.795 --> 01:19:29.331
It keeps them young.

01:19:31.173 --> 01:19:33.960
And, actually, let me
just say something else, if I may,

01:19:33.967 --> 01:19:35.673
before we start.

01:19:36.844 --> 01:19:39.506
I, and all my staff here
at Beecham House,

01:19:39.514 --> 01:19:43.257
we owe those in our charge
an enormous debt.

01:19:44.685 --> 01:19:46.391
They inspire us.

01:19:46.562 --> 01:19:50.645
Their love of life, as you well know,
is infectious,

01:19:50.649 --> 01:19:53.186
and gives us all faith in the future.

01:19:53.193 --> 01:19:54.774
I mean that.

01:19:55.821 --> 01:19:57.402
Thank you so much.

01:20:05.121 --> 01:20:06.611
Whoops!

01:20:56.959 --> 01:20:58.495
Thank you.

01:21:02.964 --> 01:21:05.797
Oh, my darling! It's so exciting!

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.007
- They loved the Brindisi.
- Oh, good.

01:21:08.011 --> 01:21:10.843
Tadek, quick! Come and do my dress.

01:21:10.846 --> 01:21:12.382
OK. OK.

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:14.425
Make sure there's no black showing,
yeah?

01:21:14.433 --> 01:21:15.969
- OK.
- OK.

01:21:17.394 --> 01:21:18.930
Dress is done.

01:21:26.861 --> 01:21:29.022
Reggie likes this one, but I think...

01:21:30.406 --> 01:21:32.361
- I think I'll wear this.
- Yes.

01:22:14.028 --> 01:22:16.110
Hey, Reg, remember the Barber of Seville

01:22:16.113 --> 01:22:17.728
in the '60s in Covent Garden?

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:18.775
Yeah?

01:22:18.783 --> 01:22:20.569
Who was that big, fat, mezzo-soprano

01:22:20.576 --> 01:22:22.987
who was doing it with a little tenor
in the bathtub?

01:22:22.994 --> 01:22:25.155
She got suctioned in.
What was her name?

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:26.866
I can't remember.

01:22:26.873 --> 01:22:29.615
London. Remember.
The wee guy couldn't get out!

01:22:29.626 --> 01:22:31.617
She was Italian.

01:22:31.628 --> 01:22:34.494
The tenor had to dial
the emergency services.

01:22:36.465 --> 01:22:38.001
What was her name?

01:22:38.008 --> 01:22:40.750
Oh, uh... uh... Elizabeta Botticelli.

01:22:40.761 --> 01:22:43.343
That's it. Elizabeta Botticelli.

01:22:43.514 --> 01:22:46.175
They say her high notes
were never the same again.

01:22:46.182 --> 01:22:47.262
True.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.101
I always think you take
the last bit too quick.

01:22:57.109 --> 01:22:59.896
- No, we don't take it too quick.
- No, it's the last four bars.

01:22:59.903 --> 01:23:01.689
Listen to Tony on the trumpet.

01:23:01.863 --> 01:23:04.649
What about the trumpet?
Doesn't matter about the trumpet.

01:23:04.657 --> 01:23:06.397
Sometimes he'd slow down at the end.

01:23:06.409 --> 01:23:09.321
We'll just take two steps after the end,
the way we always do.

01:23:24.134 --> 01:23:25.669
Brava!

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:44.099
Three Little Maids From School

01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:02.077
Jean, is that too much?

01:24:02.084 --> 01:24:03.244
No.

01:24:03.252 --> 01:24:05.618
I'm so happy to be here doing this.

01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:07.790
And you and Reggie are friends again.

01:24:07.797 --> 01:24:10.755
- How long were the two of you married?
- Nine hours.

01:24:10.759 --> 01:24:12.340
- Nine hours?
- Yes.

01:24:12.344 --> 01:24:13.959
Ha! Nine hours!

01:24:15.263 --> 01:24:16.844
We were together for about a year,

01:24:16.848 --> 01:24:19.634
and he finally got down on his knees
and asked me to marry him

01:24:19.642 --> 01:24:22.099
and I said yes -
he's very old-fashioned.

01:24:22.102 --> 01:24:24.093
- He still is.
- I know.

01:24:24.104 --> 01:24:26.186
And we were gonna get married
in the January

01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:27.975
and then I got that offer from La Scala.

01:24:27.982 --> 01:24:30.018
I remember that. I remember.

01:24:30.193 --> 01:24:33.731
But when I was at La Scala, I had...

01:24:33.738 --> 01:24:35.820
...I had a fling with a tenor.

01:24:35.823 --> 01:24:37.905
Why on earth would you do that?

01:24:37.909 --> 01:24:40.775
Because I'd had too much champagne.
I was pissed.

01:24:40.786 --> 01:24:43.869
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:24:44.915 --> 01:24:46.451
Where's Harry?

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:51.622
What's his name, that tenor?

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:53.836
I know who you mean. Roberto di Angelis.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:57.043
- But he was so persuasive.
- I know.

01:24:57.051 --> 01:24:58.961
Anyway, we came back.

01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:01.967
We had this wonderful wedding breakfast,

01:25:01.971 --> 01:25:04.553
champagne and scrambled eggs.

01:25:04.557 --> 01:25:07.094
And I told him about Roberto.

01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:09.974
Why on earth did you do that?

01:25:09.978 --> 01:25:11.514
I wanted to be honest.

01:25:11.522 --> 01:25:13.638
Anyway, he was very angry.

01:25:13.816 --> 01:25:15.397
- So he walked out?
- He ran.

01:25:15.401 --> 01:25:16.982
He was heartbroken, Jean.

01:25:16.985 --> 01:25:18.816
So was I.

01:25:19.904 --> 01:25:21.485
So was I.

01:25:23.533 --> 01:25:25.649
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

01:25:25.827 --> 01:25:30.490
Darling girl,
you still have your future.

01:25:30.497 --> 01:25:32.408
There's not a lot of it.

01:25:32.416 --> 01:25:34.156
Most of it's been.

01:25:36.586 --> 01:25:38.201
No, it hasn't.

01:25:46.262 --> 01:25:47.547
Amen!

01:25:51.057 --> 01:25:53.013
Wonderful!

01:25:53.017 --> 01:25:56.054
- Are you having any fun?
Yes!

01:26:07.322 --> 01:26:10.314
Do you know, darling,
I last wore this in 1983?

01:26:10.325 --> 01:26:12.110
Arts Council tour of India.

01:26:12.118 --> 01:26:14.575
And I fell in love with the maharajah.

01:26:14.579 --> 01:26:16.535
I'll help you with it.

01:26:16.539 --> 01:26:18.279
Ooh, thanks. Yeah.

01:26:19.375 --> 01:26:22.491
Oh, this isn't...
God, this is tight, Cissy.

01:26:22.502 --> 01:26:24.868
- What's... what's the matter?
- I can't fasten it.

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:26.661
Oh. Come on.

01:26:27.841 --> 01:26:30.958
Well, I altered it. I altered it.

01:26:30.969 --> 01:26:33.505
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm trying, I'm try...

01:26:33.512 --> 01:26:35.969
- I can't do it.
- Well, try. Just try...

01:26:35.973 --> 01:26:38.180
I cannot fasten it, Cissy!
I can't fasten it.

01:26:38.184 --> 01:26:40.800
Oh, alright. Well, I'll...
I'll let it out a bit more.

01:26:40.811 --> 01:26:43.347
Alright. Well, I've got
some safety pins somewhere.

01:26:43.354 --> 01:26:45.219
- My scissors.
- Cissy?

01:26:46.357 --> 01:26:47.813
Cissy?

01:26:47.817 --> 01:26:49.557
Cissy, where are you going?

01:26:49.569 --> 01:26:51.105
I... I have to go home.

01:26:51.112 --> 01:26:52.443
What are you talking about?

01:26:52.447 --> 01:26:54.311
Mother and Father are waiting for me.

01:26:54.323 --> 01:26:56.609
Cissy's gone walkabout! Reg, Wilf!

01:27:00.829 --> 01:27:01.909
Cissy!

01:27:01.914 --> 01:27:03.403
Oh!

01:27:03.581 --> 01:27:06.072
I nearly forgot to say goodbye to you.

01:27:06.083 --> 01:27:09.075
Goodbye, Wilfred. Goodbye, Reginald.
Wish me bon voyage.

01:27:09.086 --> 01:27:10.872
- Cissy?!
- I'm late!

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.915
Cissy.

01:27:14.257 --> 01:27:16.373
- Don't let them see her like this.
- Cissy.

01:27:16.384 --> 01:27:17.920
I have to go.

01:27:17.928 --> 01:27:19.418
Cissy.

01:27:19.596 --> 01:27:21.302
You mustn't leave.

01:27:21.306 --> 01:27:23.137
We're doing the quartet, Cissy.

01:27:23.141 --> 01:27:25.756
- The quartet from Rigoletto.
- No. I want to go home.

01:27:25.935 --> 01:27:27.550
Jean?

01:27:27.561 --> 01:27:30.303
Is that Jean Horton?
I thought she wouldn't sing anymore.

01:27:30.314 --> 01:27:32.805
Cissy. Come with me
and we'll get your luggage.

01:27:34.692 --> 01:27:36.273
My big case?

01:27:36.277 --> 01:27:37.813
Yes, your big case.

01:27:37.821 --> 01:27:39.482
Come with me. And your passport.

01:27:39.656 --> 01:27:41.021
Yes.

01:27:41.032 --> 01:27:42.647
Yes. There we are.

01:27:44.244 --> 01:27:46.780
The ship doesn't leave for two weeks,
you know.

01:27:46.787 --> 01:27:50.120
- Doesn't it?
- No. We've got plenty of time.

01:27:50.123 --> 01:27:53.206
Mais la vie...
- It's alright.

01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:55.246
It's the little things
that get you down.

01:27:55.254 --> 01:27:56.868
I know. But we'll get your dress fixed.

01:27:57.046 --> 01:27:58.582
That was a close one.

01:27:59.632 --> 01:28:01.213
Jean was very good.

01:28:01.217 --> 01:28:03.003
She was indeed.

01:28:08.223 --> 01:28:10.009
Shh!

01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:33.906
We're getting close, gents.

01:28:33.913 --> 01:28:35.995
- Thank you, Simon.
- Thanks, Si.

01:28:37.082 --> 01:28:39.323
Getting near, ladies.

01:28:39.501 --> 01:28:40.536
Ready!

01:28:48.092 --> 01:28:49.628
Where shall I.?

01:28:49.635 --> 01:28:51.296
It's through there, Cissy.

01:28:51.304 --> 01:28:52.840
Mr Paget.

01:28:54.348 --> 01:28:56.259
- You're on next.
- Thanks.

01:28:57.435 --> 01:28:59.220
Jean, I was thinking about the sticks.

01:28:59.227 --> 01:29:01.218
I think we could get through
without them.

01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:04.016
Oh, no. No, I don't think I could.
My hip's very bad today.

01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:06.522
Well, I'm not so good,
but I think we should try.

01:29:06.526 --> 01:29:08.481
It's more distinguished, more operatic.

01:29:08.485 --> 01:29:10.316
I may have to lean on you.

01:29:10.321 --> 01:29:12.357
Lean on Reg. You'll be much safer.

01:29:12.364 --> 01:29:15.447
And he'll love it because he adores you.

01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:17.237
Trust me.

01:29:17.244 --> 01:29:18.779
How do you know?

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:21.619
I don't believe
he ever stopped loving you.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.416
How do you know?
Did he say so?

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.909
Wilf!

01:29:29.087 --> 01:29:31.578
It's the man from Opera Today.

01:29:46.145 --> 01:29:47.681
You look very handsome.

01:29:48.898 --> 01:29:50.637
You look very beautiful.

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.441
We're both very old.

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.815
Thanks.

01:29:58.865 --> 01:30:00.400
Then let's get married.

01:30:43.488 --> 01:30:45.149
Were you serious?

01:30:45.156 --> 01:30:46.521
Yes.

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:47.985
OK.
