[Man]
This is the city. Los Angeles, California.

00:22.006 --> 00:27.213
465 square miles of constantly
interfacing humanity...

00:27.303 --> 00:30.636
representing every race, colour...

00:30.723 --> 00:34.008
creed and persuasion...

00:35.602 --> 00:39.470
that God,
no matter how he is worshipped...

00:39.565 --> 00:42.898
chose, in His infinite wisdom,
to deposit here...

00:42.985 --> 00:46.235
in the cultural nexus
of the Pacific Rim.

00:46.321 --> 00:49.239
Almost 4 million people
work and play here.

00:49.324 --> 00:52.491
And like any other place
anywhere...

00:52.577 --> 00:56.445
there are those who have it
and those who want it.

00:56.540 --> 00:59.908
Those who have it, enjoy it...

01:00.001 --> 01:01.875
no matter how they got it.

01:01.962 --> 01:05.376
Those who want it, can get it
by attempting to better themselves...

01:05.465 --> 01:09.165
in a sympathetic community populated
by decent citizens cheering them on.

01:10.303 --> 01:14.051
Or they can try to take it
the easy way.

01:14.140 --> 01:19.098
Because even in the City of Angels,
from time to time, some halos slip.

01:20.354 --> 01:25.562
That's where I come in, doing my job to
the best of my ability on a daily basis.

01:26.652 --> 01:30.152
I work here.
I carry a badge.

[Narrator] Ladies and gentlemen,
the story you are about to see is true.

04:12.856 --> 04:15.774
The names have been changed
to protect the innocent.

04:15.859 --> 04:20.983
For example, George Baker
is now called Sylvia Wiss.

04:42.301 --> 04:44.875
Hey, who called
the fire department?

04:44.971 --> 04:47.758
What the hell is going on here?

04:47.849 --> 04:49.806
Chief, where's the fire?

05:04.657 --> 05:06.234
See the fire?

05:06.325 --> 05:10.025
I see the fire.
I see the fire.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.790
Good! When you wake up...

05:14.875 --> 05:18.955
tell Jerry Caesar
he's out of business.

05:29.681 --> 05:31.839
[Detective]
It was Wednesday, January 7.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.804
A cool day in Los Angeles,
with westerly winds...

05:35.895 --> 05:38.517
and light, scattered clouds
at 3,000 feet.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.646
I was working day watch
out of Robbery-Homicide...

05:40.734 --> 05:42.856
at the same desk
my late Uncle Joe occupied...

05:42.944 --> 05:45.731
when he served with the department
20 years ago.

05:49.784 --> 05:54.161
Many aspects of the officer's routine
have changed since Uncle Joe's time.

05:54.247 --> 05:57.331
Now there are new methods,
new philosophies, new equipment.

05:57.416 --> 06:00.417
The standard service revolver
and simple lead sap...

06:00.503 --> 06:03.954
have given way to Taser guns
and anodized metal batons.

06:04.048 --> 06:07.666
But there's one thing
that never changes.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.718
The face of crime. It just gets bigger
and badder and uglier every day.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.926
My partner's name is Frank Smith.
The boss is Captain Gannon.

06:16.018 --> 06:17.429
My name's Friday.

06:17.519 --> 06:19.393
- Joe.
- Captain.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.397
Frank's late.
Must've been held up in traffic.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.851
- Frank won't be coming in today.
- 24-hour virus?

06:25.944 --> 06:28.779
- Or tomorrow.
- Forty-eight?

06:28.864 --> 06:31.569
Frank quit.
Bought a goat farm.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.529
Moved to Ukiah. Left you this note.

06:34.619 --> 06:37.324
He was too broken up to talk about it.

06:37.414 --> 06:39.703
Said he knew you'd understand.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.580
Every man has a dream to chase.
Frank's was that goat farm.

06:44.671 --> 06:48.004
- I understand. But tell me something.
- Yeah?

06:48.091 --> 06:52.041
Those 3.6 million citizens who expected
him to be on the job this morning...

06:52.137 --> 06:53.714
will they understand?

06:58.851 --> 07:00.511
[Friday]
8:47 a.m.

07:00.603 --> 07:04.815
Captain Gannon had assigned me
to investigate the Pagan robberies...

07:04.899 --> 07:08.102
a pattern of serial crimes
which had occurred throughout the city.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.563
They'd seemed merely irritating,
but were gaining notoriety...

07:11.656 --> 07:13.862
through their growing frequency
and naked brazenness.

07:13.949 --> 07:17.116
I was to contact my new partner
at the central receiving lot.

07:17.203 --> 07:21.781
A less experienced officer might have
been concerned he was getting potluck.

07:21.874 --> 07:25.207
But I knew that any detective
the department had to offer me...

07:25.294 --> 07:28.248
was automatically worthy
of my respect.

07:30.966 --> 07:33.801
- Sergeant Friday?
- Who wants to know?

07:33.886 --> 07:36.673
I'm Pep Streebek,
your new partner.

07:36.763 --> 07:41.010
- Not looking like that, you aren't.
- Really? What's that mean?

07:41.101 --> 07:44.137
It means I don't care what
undercover rock you crawled out from...

07:44.229 --> 07:46.601
there's a dress code for detectives
in Robbery-Homicide.

07:46.690 --> 07:48.314
Section 3-605...

07:48.400 --> 07:52.978
.10,.20,.22,.24,.26,
.50,.70,.80.

07:53.071 --> 07:56.522
It specifies clean shirt, short hair,
tie, pressed trousers...

07:56.616 --> 08:00.067
sports jacket or suit and leather shoes,
preferable with a high shine.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.742
9:05 a.m.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.504
Streebek's unauthorized outfit
and facial growth were history.

08:09.587 --> 08:14.498
For the first time in 12 years, I rolled
into traffic with a new partner.

08:24.393 --> 08:26.931
Detective Pep Streebek:
Male, Caucasian...

08:27.021 --> 08:29.263
six feet, 165 pounds...

08:29.356 --> 08:31.432
no distinguishing scars.

08:31.525 --> 08:34.976
He had an extensive list
of merit citations which was tainted...

08:35.070 --> 08:37.312
by his total disregard
for departmental procedure.

08:37.405 --> 08:40.158
He pictured himself
as some hipster, free-bird cop.

08:40.241 --> 08:42.150
But his wings were about
to be clipped...

08:42.244 --> 08:45.613
because now he was going to play
the detective game by my rules.

08:47.791 --> 08:52.085
[Horns Honking]

08:52.170 --> 08:57.377
[Honking Continues]

08:57.467 --> 09:00.836
Friday, we're allowed to go 55.

09:02.138 --> 09:04.178
On some occasions, even faster.

09:05.392 --> 09:07.883
I'm well aware of the
federally-mandated speed limit.

09:07.977 --> 09:10.978
But did it ever occur to you
that by going 8 miles an hour slower...

09:11.064 --> 09:15.809
we might save gas and ease the burden
on the taxpayers who pay our salaries?

09:15.902 --> 09:18.856
A little extra gas
isn't gonna put the city in hock.

09:18.946 --> 09:20.856
Besides, this looks bad.

09:20.948 --> 09:25.242
Live a little!
It's the vertical pedal on the right.

09:25.328 --> 09:28.531
9:47 a.m.
We arrived at the Griffith Park Zoo...

09:28.623 --> 09:33.415
Los Angeles's habitat for wild animals
sustained in dignified captivity.

09:33.502 --> 09:37.417
An adult male lion and a security guard
had been tranquillized with a dart gun...

09:37.506 --> 09:39.795
and subsequent robberies
had occurred.

09:39.884 --> 09:41.793
These animals have it pretty good.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.376
Simulated surroundings,
three squares a day.

09:44.471 --> 09:48.303
If these creatures could talk, they'd
give the citizens a vote of thanks.

09:48.392 --> 09:51.843
Friday, these animals...

09:51.937 --> 09:56.563
were trapped, stunned and roped,
crated and shipped, dropped into cages.

09:56.650 --> 10:00.268
You think they were in the wild
forming lines, jockeying for position...

10:00.362 --> 10:03.565
saying, "Take me!
I want to live on damn cement"?

10:03.657 --> 10:06.658
When I look in their eyes,
I get a different message.

10:06.743 --> 10:08.866
We'll leave it at that.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.909
Are you the police?

10:15.001 --> 10:18.417
Friday, Streebek. Robbery.
You have some Pagan cards?

10:18.505 --> 10:21.920
Yeah. Three of them.
Left in separate cages.

10:22.008 --> 10:24.878
Let me show you where I found them.

10:24.969 --> 10:27.590
This is Ben, our boa constrictor.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.808
The missing giant anaconda was still
here last night at 8:30.

10:31.893 --> 10:34.348
I know because that's when it gets
its final feeding.

10:34.437 --> 10:36.679
It's not always its final feeding.

10:36.772 --> 10:39.773
Sometimes it hides a little snack
for later.

10:39.859 --> 10:41.898
Just the facts,
if you don't mind, ma'am.

10:41.986 --> 10:44.559
What exactly does a Central Bolivian
Anaconda choose to feed on?

10:44.655 --> 10:46.980
It eats whole, live groundhogs.

10:47.074 --> 10:50.609
- You skip breakfast, Friday?
- Whoever stole it's gotta feed it.

10:50.703 --> 10:53.953
We also seem to be missing
one of these.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.918
What is the approximate dry weight
of the Madagascar Fruit Tree Bat?

10:59.002 --> 11:01.374
You mean you don't know?

11:03.298 --> 11:06.999
This is the one
I understand the least.

11:11.014 --> 11:15.475
Somebody must've wanted that lion's mane
bad to pull a stunt like that.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.973
Although, as Mohawks go,
it's not that bad. It'll grow back.

11:20.065 --> 11:24.477
How do you tell that to kids who haven't
seen a lion and won't want to again?

11:24.569 --> 11:26.727
Kids, it'll grow back.

11:26.821 --> 11:29.193
Yea!

11:30.700 --> 11:31.980
[Friday]
10:35 a.m.

11:32.076 --> 11:35.113
Arsonists posing as firemen
had left a Pagan card...

11:35.204 --> 11:37.493
in the charred ruins
of a downtown warehouse.

11:37.582 --> 11:40.499
We were advised to contact
the owner of the stolen merchandise...

11:40.585 --> 11:42.957
soft-core porno lord, Jerry Caesar...

11:43.045 --> 11:46.995
at his notorious pleasure compound
in the coveted Bel-Air section.

11:47.091 --> 11:49.333

11:52.638 --> 11:55.010

Oh, thank God! Vibrator repair?

11:56.725 --> 11:59.512
No, ma'am.
Los Angeles Police Department.

11:59.603 --> 12:01.311
Sorry.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.568
It's enough to churn your guts,
isn't it?

12:12.658 --> 12:15.612
This girl pruning this bush
with her...

12:15.702 --> 12:19.118
That a slut peddler like Jerry Caesar
could build a modern day Gomorrah...

12:19.206 --> 12:22.621
in the same city where they recorded
"We Are the World."

12:30.008 --> 12:32.380
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:33.470 --> 12:35.047
Don't get too friendly.

12:39.434 --> 12:41.011
Hi. Can I help you?

12:41.102 --> 12:44.637
Police officers, ma'am.
L.A.P.D. Robbery. I'm Friday. This is...

12:44.731 --> 12:47.056
- April!
- That's right.

12:47.150 --> 12:48.976
She was a Baitmate.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.393
Bait magazine.
She was featured.

12:51.487 --> 12:53.859
I get the hang of it.
In the April issue.

12:53.948 --> 12:57.815
No, Mr Silly. February!
My name is April.

12:57.910 --> 13:02.406
Don't tell me. Your favourite movies are
The Sound of Music and Yes, Giorgio.

13:02.498 --> 13:04.490
You love to go bobbing for apples.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.955
Your major turn-offs are...

13:07.044 --> 13:11.089
anchovies, people
who don't use coasters and...

13:11.173 --> 13:14.957
And men who smoke in public places.

13:16.261 --> 13:18.170
Let's go meet Jerry.

13:28.648 --> 13:30.890
There's Jerry over there.

13:40.035 --> 13:42.323
I'm gonna have a place
like this someday.

13:42.412 --> 13:44.654
Dream on, Streebek, dream on.

13:51.713 --> 13:53.670
It's about time.

13:53.756 --> 13:55.963
I called you cops three hours ago.

13:56.050 --> 13:59.051
Yes, sir. My name's Friday.
This is Detective Streebek.

13:59.804 --> 14:01.298
What's missing?

14:01.389 --> 14:03.880
How about the entire run...

14:03.975 --> 14:07.806
every single copy of our
25th Anniversary double issue of Bait.

14:08.896 --> 14:11.469
- Bait.
- That's his skin magazine.

14:11.565 --> 14:15.563
You say.
The intelligent subscriber regards it...

14:15.653 --> 14:18.570
as a politically-oriented,
socially-impacted monthly.

14:18.656 --> 14:22.404
I'm not gonna allow a gang
of cement heads to intimidate me...

14:22.493 --> 14:24.781
just because I refused to publish
their stupid manifesto.

14:24.870 --> 14:29.366
- Tell us about that.
- Here. Read it for yourself.

14:31.251 --> 14:33.457
"Manifest of the International
Brotherhood of Pagan.

14:33.545 --> 14:37.495
We believe bad sex and good drugs are
the cornerstone of a great democracy.

14:37.591 --> 14:41.042
- The peak of pornography..."
- We get the general idea.

14:41.136 --> 14:45.133
My publishing company is not a
private platform for a bunch of yahoos.

14:45.223 --> 14:47.714
I don't care how many copies
they buy.

14:47.809 --> 14:51.509
I don't have to publish their junk just
because they got 1st amendment rights.

14:51.604 --> 14:53.811
I've got 1st amendment rights, too.
Look 'em up.

14:53.898 --> 14:56.472
I don't have.
I can quote 'em to you.

14:56.568 --> 15:00.102
Anyhow, how much do you figure
a monthly run of your...

15:00.196 --> 15:02.153
"magazine" is worth?

15:03.116 --> 15:07.943
It's more money than you'll ever see
in your life. And I do that every month.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.496
My money's clean.

15:09.580 --> 15:13.874
I'll tell you what you do before you go
home and start polishing your pennies.

15:13.959 --> 15:17.210
Go out and get my magazines
back on the stand where they belong.

15:17.296 --> 15:22.124
Listen, hotshot, I don't care for you or
the putrid sludge you're trowelling out.

15:22.218 --> 15:26.796
But until the laws are changed,
my job's to get back your boxes of smut.

15:26.889 --> 15:29.296
Since I'll be doing it holding my nose,
I'll be doing it with one hand.

15:31.435 --> 15:34.768
Excuse me. Jerry, it's time
for your collagen treatment.

15:34.855 --> 15:37.891
And don't forget, you're having
your pores sucked at 3:00.

15:38.984 --> 15:40.526
Thank you, Sylvia.

15:40.610 --> 15:43.066
Boys, as you can see,
I've got my work to do.

15:43.155 --> 15:46.358
Why don't you get the hell out of here
and do yours?

15:52.664 --> 15:55.071
You have very strong hands.

15:55.166 --> 15:57.455
Hey, Sylvia Wiss!

15:58.878 --> 16:00.254
Yes, that's me.

16:00.338 --> 16:03.209
They oughta transfer you to
Missing Persons. You know everybody.

16:03.299 --> 16:08.294
Don't you read the papers? Saturday is
Bait magazine's 25th anniversary party.

16:08.388 --> 16:11.591
Caesar is reuniting all
of his former Baitmates.

16:11.682 --> 16:16.807
Miss Sylvia Wiss, right here,
was the very first Baitmate ever.

16:16.896 --> 16:18.307
Fascinating.

16:18.397 --> 16:23.225
Sergeant, if I asked your honest opinion
about something, would I get it?

16:23.319 --> 16:25.276
You can bet the house on it.

16:26.447 --> 16:29.234
Would you say these look like
the breasts of a 43-year-old woman?

16:32.745 --> 16:35.948
No. No, they don't, Miss Wiss.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.455
They're quite impressive,
bordering on spectacular.

16:39.543 --> 16:41.452
We have to be running along now.

16:41.545 --> 16:43.952
What's your hurry?

16:44.047 --> 16:46.669
Wouldn't you like to have
an early lunch?

16:47.884 --> 16:50.375
Listen, Joe,
it's the darndest thing.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.970
I seem to have
left my notebook in the car.

16:54.057 --> 16:57.924
It's gonna take me 15, 20 min...
A half an hour to find it.

16:58.019 --> 17:02.812
Why don't you pump Sylvia privately
for information?

17:02.899 --> 17:04.939
And I'II, you know...

17:05.026 --> 17:08.810
- Nice meeting you, Miss Wiss.
- I had a good time, too.

17:08.905 --> 17:12.488
Come on. Let's go to the car
and find that notebook.

17:13.910 --> 17:15.819
Are you crazy?

17:15.912 --> 17:17.820
Sylvia Wiss wanted you.

17:19.123 --> 17:21.031
Let me tell you something.

17:21.125 --> 17:24.493
There are two things which differentiate
the human species from animals.

17:24.587 --> 17:28.335
One, we use cutlery.
Two, we can control our sexual urges.

17:28.424 --> 17:32.920
You might be an exception, but don't
drag me into your private hell.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.764
You've got a lot
of repressed feelings, don't you?

17:37.850 --> 17:40.720
Must be what keeps your hair up.

17:51.029 --> 17:55.276
- What is bothering you besides me?
- I'm thinking about those Pagans.

17:55.367 --> 17:59.447
If all they were after was revenge
against Caesar, it's slime versus slime.

17:59.538 --> 18:04.246
But when they attack great institutions
like our city zoo, my hackles turn red.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.703
You'll lose those red hackles
if you eat those chili dogs.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.373
I can handle it.

18:09.464 --> 18:13.248
They're the worst thing for you.
Filled with nitrates, toxins, poisons.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.252
And you're doubling up on them.

18:15.345 --> 18:19.259
Mister, outside of cigarettes
I only have one vice: Chili dogs.

18:19.349 --> 18:22.303
So pipe down and let me
enjoy my lunch in peace.

18:22.393 --> 18:26.011
Do you know the things that can fall
into an industrial sausage press...

18:26.105 --> 18:29.688
not excluding rodent hairs
and bug excrement?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.852
I hate you, Streebek.

18:41.203 --> 18:45.699
Except for you and canned cling peaches,
I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone...

18:45.791 --> 18:48.496
that doesn't know you should never leave
your car keys in the ignition.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.871
It's called a mistake. But I don't
suppose you ever make any of those.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.336
At ease, Streebek.
We got another one.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.962
Chemical train hijack
at the freight yards.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.625
Damn Pagans must be living on No-Doz.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.047
Yes, sir. We'll roll
as soon as we requisition a new...

19:02.140 --> 19:05.556
One more thing.
Police and fire departments...

19:05.644 --> 19:09.558
have been reporting vehicles stolen,
so keep an eye on your car.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.647
[Friday]
1:15 p.m. After requisitioning a replacement vehicle...

19:18.740 --> 19:21.361
we were issued
a new Ford Escort subcompact...

19:21.451 --> 19:26.445
and responded to the call at Southern
California's largest railhead...

19:26.539 --> 19:30.240
with more than 1,000 miles of track
lying parallel over 2 million ties...

19:30.335 --> 19:32.292
hewn from majestic redwood forests.

19:33.546 --> 19:37.129
3,000 gallons of two deadly chemicals
had been siphoned individually...

19:37.216 --> 19:40.253
from their respective
hijacked tanker cars.

19:40.344 --> 19:43.760
We questioned the battered
train engineer, SeÃ±or Tito Provencal...

19:43.848 --> 19:47.430
and attempted to determine the precise
identification of the missing gases...

19:47.518 --> 19:51.219
from the owner of the
chemicals company, a Mr Roy Grest.

19:51.313 --> 19:56.271
Actually trichlornitromethan
and the pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.400
Pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

19:58.487 --> 20:02.152
They're shipped in separate containers.
Mixed properly in the exact ratio...

20:02.241 --> 20:05.526
they form a liquid fertilizer
that's clear as water.

20:05.619 --> 20:07.944
- But you wouldn't want to smell it.
- Why is that?

20:08.038 --> 20:11.324
It burns the eyes, lungs, and throat,
causes vomiting...

20:11.416 --> 20:13.705
and if continuously inhaled, death.

20:13.794 --> 20:16.249
Sort of like your aftershave.

20:26.681 --> 20:31.224
[Announcer] It's time to "Advance"
with the Reverend Jonathan Whirley...

20:31.311 --> 20:35.640
founder of MAMA,
the Moral Advance Movement of America.

20:35.732 --> 20:40.773
Today, Dr Whirley's special guest is
police commissioner for Los Angeles...

20:40.862 --> 20:43.400
Ms. Jane Kirkpatrick.

20:43.489 --> 20:46.027
Dr Whirley.

20:46.117 --> 20:50.494
Thank you, George,
and welcome once again to Advance.

20:51.622 --> 20:52.867
Commissioner...

20:52.957 --> 20:55.530
Please, will you call me Jane?

20:55.626 --> 20:59.493
Only if you call me Jonathan.
[Chuckling]

20:59.588 --> 21:02.506
Have you seen this guy?
What a mental fur ball.

21:02.591 --> 21:04.999
Happens to be one of my favourite shows.

21:05.094 --> 21:07.051
Why don't you listen and learn?

21:07.137 --> 21:12.132
What a deep honour it is for this city
that you have chosen Los Angeles...

21:12.226 --> 21:16.638
to be the new focal point for
the Moral Advance Movement of America.

21:16.730 --> 21:20.858
It's quite simple, Jane.

21:20.943 --> 21:24.109
If one wishes to effect a financial
upheaval in this country...

21:24.196 --> 21:26.687
one should set his or her sights
on Wall Street.

21:26.782 --> 21:30.482
If one wishes to revolutionize
the political system...

21:30.577 --> 21:33.578
he or she would naturally
go to Washington.

21:33.663 --> 21:37.246
But when dealing...

21:37.334 --> 21:40.584
with pornography, filth, crime...

21:40.670 --> 21:42.828
degradation...

21:42.922 --> 21:46.505
what better place is there to begin with
than Los Angeles...

21:47.510 --> 21:50.083
the current capital of depravity...

21:50.179 --> 21:53.844
in what sadly passes
for the modern world.

22:03.693 --> 22:05.270
[Friday]
2:15 p.m.

22:05.361 --> 22:09.987
We had been advised to follow up on
a theft at 8823467 Magnolia Boulevard.

22:10.074 --> 22:12.363
At this time of day,
it took us 20 minutes to get there.

22:12.451 --> 22:14.444
The complainant was the landlady,
Enid Borden.

22:14.537 --> 22:16.612
Some Pagan cards had been found.

22:21.877 --> 22:24.582
- What the hell do you want?
- Police officers, ma'am.

22:24.671 --> 22:26.747
About time you pencil dicks showed up.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.296
Why couldn't you have gotten here
before that big, bad...

22:29.384 --> 22:32.884
stupid-Iooking piece of sewage breath
stole my wedding dress?

22:32.971 --> 22:35.640
Sewage breath would be
your nickname for...

22:35.724 --> 22:37.266
Muzz. Emil Muzz.

22:37.350 --> 22:39.639
Not much of an improvement.

22:39.728 --> 22:45.102
That ass-wipe also stiffed me for two
months' rent when his cheque bounced.

22:45.191 --> 22:47.350
Goddam puss-faced pimp stick.

22:47.444 --> 22:49.732
All that was left in his room...

22:49.821 --> 22:52.110
was a big box of these things.

22:56.953 --> 23:00.203
Any idea where Emil Muzz could be now?
Friends? Family?

23:00.289 --> 23:03.789
He was a Ioner.
Took off in the middle of the night.

23:03.876 --> 23:05.999
Useless scum-lapping shitbag.

23:06.087 --> 23:08.293
Just the facts, ma'am.
He leave anything else behind?

23:08.381 --> 23:12.165
Yeah, a tape deck which I had to sell
to make up for the lost rent.

23:12.259 --> 23:16.257
So there's nothing you can do about it,
you slimy little jizz bucket.

23:16.347 --> 23:20.558
Yes, ma'am. Although you could be cited
for swearing at us.

23:20.643 --> 23:22.635
Says who, flathead?

23:22.728 --> 23:26.678
The California penal code 314.1
covering obscene conduct in public.

23:26.774 --> 23:28.184
Good enough for you?

23:28.275 --> 23:31.810
Them magazines and papers
were his down in the trash.

23:31.904 --> 23:33.896
No cheques or money. I looked.

23:33.989 --> 23:36.314
I should've thrown it in the river
the day he left...

23:36.408 --> 23:39.824
but unlike some people,
I have a heart, goddam it!

23:39.911 --> 23:42.237
That miserable bag of puke.

23:44.624 --> 23:48.124
I think we're finished here,
don't you, Detective Streebek?

23:50.088 --> 23:53.291
Didn't she say she threw
some of his stuff in the trash?

23:53.383 --> 23:56.337
There it goes. Let's roll.

24:11.109 --> 24:13.516
Am I glad I got transferred
into Robbery-Homicide!

24:13.611 --> 24:17.110
You can almost reach out
and touch the tension.

24:17.198 --> 24:19.950
What the hell was that?

24:20.034 --> 24:21.943
It has its days.

24:22.036 --> 24:24.194
Yeah. Like today.

24:24.288 --> 24:28.997
Sitting in a park, getting eaten
by ducks, sifting through garbage.

24:29.084 --> 24:32.916
Hello! Photographs of people.
Kinda faded.

24:33.005 --> 24:36.290
- Maybe one of them's Muzz.
- We couldn't be that lucky.

24:39.428 --> 24:42.180
Hey, phone number.
Think it means something?

24:42.264 --> 24:45.715
There's only one way to find out,
isn't there?

24:51.231 --> 24:53.603
It's for you. The president.

25:08.248 --> 25:09.493
It's ringing.

25:13.336 --> 25:16.290
- Good afternoon. Caesar residence.
- Bingo.

25:16.381 --> 25:19.050
- Hello. May I help you?
- Emil Muzz, please.

25:19.133 --> 25:22.585
- He's not here right now.
- This is Sergeant Friday, L.A.P.D.

25:22.678 --> 25:24.718
Could you tell us where he is?

25:24.805 --> 25:27.510
He's Mr Caesar's driver...

25:27.600 --> 25:31.847
and Mr Caesar's sailing on his yacht.

25:31.937 --> 25:34.096
That's it.
The limousine from the mansion.

25:34.190 --> 25:35.981
Yeah, and Emil Muzz.

25:36.066 --> 25:38.640
Let's check Enid Borden's description.

25:38.736 --> 25:40.527
Well...

25:40.613 --> 25:42.854
"Big, bad, stupid-Iooking."

25:42.948 --> 25:44.608
An exact match.

25:58.422 --> 26:00.498
Police officers. Emil Muzz?

26:04.886 --> 26:07.294
We need to ask you
a few questions.

26:07.389 --> 26:09.346
Blow it out your pants, cop.

26:09.432 --> 26:12.469
Good, Muzz.
Give yourself a hard time.

26:20.652 --> 26:22.312
I'll drive!

26:45.718 --> 26:47.627
- What are you doing?
- Calling for backup.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.637
- Why?
- There are regulations for pursuit.

26:50.723 --> 26:54.341
- We're gonna follow every one of them.
- Forget it. This is our collar.

26:54.435 --> 26:56.474
- Our collar, huh?
- I think so.

26:56.562 --> 26:58.803
Let me tell you something,
Mr Lone Wolf.

26:58.897 --> 27:02.646
The dedicated people of the Los Angeles
Police Department are one big family...

27:02.734 --> 27:05.439
from my brother, the traffic cop,
to my sister, the metre maid.

27:05.529 --> 27:09.147
And when one of us makes a collar,
we all make a collar.

27:09.241 --> 27:12.775
Are you on any medication that as
your partner I should be made aware of?

27:12.869 --> 27:16.072
2-King-14.
I am requesting a backup...

27:20.585 --> 27:23.420
Oh, no! Ahh!

27:38.978 --> 27:40.093
Look out!

27:54.910 --> 27:56.369
Look out! Muppets.

28:15.806 --> 28:20.681
Reckless endangerment of human life,
wilful disregard of private property...

28:20.769 --> 28:24.434
- He's really racking up the violations.
- Not him, you!

28:24.523 --> 28:28.057
Your ticket back to civilian life, Mr
l-Like-To-Throw-The-Book-Out-The-Window.

28:28.151 --> 28:29.859
That's a good idea.

28:37.327 --> 28:39.153
Ever been to Hawaii?

28:50.423 --> 28:52.665
Look out!

29:00.558 --> 29:02.431
Surf's up, but not for you.

29:02.518 --> 29:05.803
You'll be hanging 10 downtown.
Read him his rights.

29:05.896 --> 29:07.972
Emil Muzz, guess what!

29:08.065 --> 29:10.141
You are under arrest!

29:12.820 --> 29:15.393
Sit down, unless you're growing!

29:15.489 --> 29:18.525
We've got you on
'87 motre vehicle violations.

29:18.617 --> 29:21.369
It's only time before we tie you in
to one of those Pagan jobs.

29:21.453 --> 29:23.576
And you stole
your landlady's wedding dress...

29:23.664 --> 29:27.032
which is the only endearing thing
about you, so talk to us.

29:29.628 --> 29:32.415
Listen, you public pawn.
My attorney's on his way.

29:32.506 --> 29:35.709
We both know I'll be out
on bail.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.089
So take off these cuffs
and open the door!

29:38.178 --> 29:43.338
I wouldn't worry about the door. Scum
who'd represent you would ooze under it.

29:43.433 --> 29:47.217
Joe, why don't you go get
a couple cups of coffee?

29:47.312 --> 29:50.063
I could use one.
You want anything?

29:50.148 --> 29:53.980
Chewing gum, Snickers bar,
and my attorney, badge kisser!

30:10.084 --> 30:11.744
Well, Emil.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.537
It's just you...

30:16.674 --> 30:18.880
and me...

30:18.968 --> 30:20.925
and your balls...

30:21.011 --> 30:23.217
and this drawer.

30:28.352 --> 30:33.428
- [Drawer Slamming]
- [Emil Screaming]

30:40.363 --> 30:42.023
[Friday]
4:15 p.m.

30:42.115 --> 30:46.611
By the time I had returned with coffee,
Muzz was singing like Beverly Sills.

30:46.703 --> 30:49.787
He had been planning to attend a meeting
that night at the Pagan clubhouse...

30:49.873 --> 30:53.123
but he refused to divulge the time
or location of that meeting.

30:53.209 --> 30:55.534
Muzz, let's run through it again.

30:55.628 --> 30:59.377
You say you're a Pagan, but you work for
Jerry Caesar. That makes you a plant.

30:59.465 --> 31:02.087
Make it easy on yourself.
Lead us to the stolen magazines.

31:02.176 --> 31:04.335
Jump on this and spin, cop.

31:04.429 --> 31:07.595
I'm not saying another word
until my attorney gets here!

31:07.682 --> 31:08.927
Joe...

31:09.016 --> 31:13.477
wouldn't a couple of Danishes
go good with this coffee?

31:22.112 --> 31:26.027
At 7:13 p.m., Captain Gannon authorized
us to stake out Muzz's clubhouse...

31:26.116 --> 31:29.319

We related the details of our successful
follow-up on the Pagan robberies...

45:31.024 --> 45:34.310
and briefed Captain Gannon on the
outlandish festival we had attended...

45:34.402 --> 45:36.561

45:52.086 --> 45:54.708
At this point, Captain Gannon
became quite upset.

45:54.797 --> 45:56.837
He accused us of being
on a drinking binge...

45:56.924 --> 46:00.293
and based on our appearance, seemed
reluctant to contact the sheriff...

46:00.386 --> 46:02.295
to investigate the area.

46:02.388 --> 46:05.923
Captain, call the sheriff's department.

have gotten away from the snake.

46:23.325 --> 46:25.116
The snake!

46:25.202 --> 46:29.034

46:37.422 --> 46:40.756

magnitude, is worthy of her attention.

46:40.842 --> 46:44.092
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

46:44.179 --> 46:46.385
- Yes, sir.
- Don't ask him that, Captain.

46:46.473 --> 46:50.422
- It's 4:27 a.m., sir.
- He lives for that. It's in his blood.

agreement to contact the commissioner...

46:58.484 --> 47:01.022
and proceed with us
to the San Gabriel Mountains...

47:01.112 --> 47:04.896
we eventually arrived at the scene
of the previous night's debauchery.

47:12.623 --> 47:16.206
What is this?
Some sort of juvenile cop humour?

47:16.293 --> 47:18.963
And where the hell
is this supposed Pagan festival?

47:19.046 --> 47:22.830
I can't understand it. There was a huge
screen with Pagan vision written on it.

47:22.925 --> 47:26.341
Yeah! Yeah! This was the hole
that was filled with water.

47:26.428 --> 47:30.212
We had to dive in to save the virgin
being eaten by the giant snake.

47:30.307 --> 47:33.012
Who are these painted cretins?

47:33.102 --> 47:37.146
- Two of my best men, ma'am.
- That's right. That's right.

47:37.231 --> 47:39.603
They're heading up
the Pagan investigation.

47:39.691 --> 47:43.985
They were heading up the investigation.
Now you may consider them off it.

47:44.071 --> 47:46.692
- But, Commissioner?
- Gannon.

47:46.782 --> 47:49.319

during a simulation surveillance.

48:02.380 --> 48:06.959
- I assume you were once a civilian.
- Yes, ma'am.

If you do not drop that insubordinate
tone, you'll be one again soon.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.808
Wait a minute, Friday.

48:17.270 --> 48:19.939
I've never known you to act this way.

48:20.022 --> 48:24.067
Certainly not the behaviour
your Uncle Joe would have approved of.

48:24.151 --> 48:27.271
You know the kind of man he was.

48:28.155 --> 48:32.319
I suggest you try to be
a little more like him from now on.

48:32.409 --> 48:34.367
Yeah, sir. I'll try.

48:35.412 --> 48:36.491

He's not in any of these.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.176
And I'll never forget his face.

49:00.228 --> 49:05.270
Okay. I guess this officially closes
my end of the investigation.

49:09.320 --> 49:12.772
As far as your personal safety
is concerned, I wouldn't worry.

effective methods of law enforcement.

They'd been playing a version
of good-cop, bad-cop.

49:56.158 --> 50:00.369
Though I was unable to fathom the rules,
it seemed Streebek had lost this round.

50:01.663 --> 50:03.620
Playtime was over...

50:03.707 --> 50:06.280
and it was back to routine duty
for me and Pep Streebek.

50:06.376 --> 50:11.501
Joe, I suddenly got very hungry.
Let's grab some sushi.

50:11.589 --> 50:15.539
We're late for our watch already,
and raw tuna isn't my bag.

50:35.071 --> 50:37.194
My hat was in that car.

50:37.281 --> 50:41.065
- I can tell who reblocked it for you.
- Pagans.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.571
I need coffee.

50:42.661 --> 50:45.283
I know where they serve
the best in town. Come on.

50:45.372 --> 50:49.452
}} [Rock And Roll Playing]

51:14.985 --> 51:16.479
Ma'am.

51:26.246 --> 51:30.623
I hate to admit it, but for once in your
life you're right. This is good coffee.

51:30.708 --> 51:32.915
You should try the French toast.

51:33.002 --> 51:35.244
Joe, lend me 20 bucks.

51:35.338 --> 51:38.921
Do I know you long enough
to lend you money? I don't think so.

51:39.008 --> 51:40.917
We've been ordered off the Pagans...

51:41.010 --> 51:44.545
but that doesn't mean we can't follow up
on one of their thefts.

51:44.639 --> 51:48.090
The trichlornitromethane and
the pseudo-halogenic compound cyanogen.

51:48.184 --> 51:53.142
There's one illegal lab in the city with
the capacity, personnel and equipment...

51:53.230 --> 51:55.389
to mix those two chemicals
into a deadly gas.

51:55.483 --> 51:59.397
Narcotics has been waiting for months to
bust this place. We can do it tonight.

51:59.486 --> 52:02.191
Forget it.
It's out of our jurisdiction now.

52:02.281 --> 52:05.946
But this won't be a Pagan investigation.
We can bring Narc in on it.

52:06.034 --> 52:10.531
Police work is a matter of us
against them, not "Mother, may I?"

52:10.622 --> 52:14.620
Hi, Kay. How are you? I could find out
where they set up the lab this week.

52:14.710 --> 52:18.079
- Oh? How?
- By you lending me 20 bucks.

52:26.137 --> 52:30.349
[Friday]
6:30 p.m. After witnessing the gratuitous sex display...

52:30.433 --> 52:33.600
at Streebek's favourite coffeehouse
and an outlay of $50 by me...

52:33.686 --> 52:38.064
to one of his old informants,
I proceeded by Celebrity Cab...

52:38.149 --> 52:40.901
to 3396834108th Street...

52:40.985 --> 52:44.853
an illegal drug lab disguised
as a legitimate place of business.

52:45.990 --> 52:47.899
Streebek had gone to seek assistance
from friends...

52:47.992 --> 52:50.863
in the undercover narcotics unit
where he used to work.

52:50.953 --> 52:52.862
It didn't surprise me
that he was late...

52:52.955 --> 52:54.912
even though he knew I was waiting
in a part of town...

52:54.999 --> 52:58.119
where it's not advisable
to stand around whistling.

}} [Whistling]

53:03.883 --> 53:05.922
Hey, zipper-head!

53:09.471 --> 53:11.594
Up late tonight, kids?

53:11.682 --> 53:13.639
Let's have one of your smokes.

53:13.726 --> 53:16.181
It's an unhealthy habit
I don't encourage in others.

53:16.270 --> 53:18.476
Get smart.
Give it up by not taking it up.

53:18.564 --> 53:20.473
Thanks for
the public service announcement.

53:20.566 --> 53:23.934
Hand over your money,
and I'll go buy my own smokes.

53:24.027 --> 53:27.147
If you're that strapped for cash,
I'd suggest a part-time job.

53:27.239 --> 53:29.148
How 'bout a paper route?

53:29.241 --> 53:31.566
It builds character.
It did in my case.

53:31.660 --> 53:35.657
Hey, we're not askin' you
for your money, Ozzie.

53:35.747 --> 53:38.155
- No?
- No.

53:38.249 --> 53:43.125
- Are you threatening me, son?
- [Hoodlums] Ooh!

54:15.160 --> 54:17.533
And on a school night, too.

54:37.307 --> 54:38.885
Hit the deck!

55:13.801 --> 55:16.007
I can't quite place it.

55:17.430 --> 55:18.840
It tastes like...

55:18.931 --> 55:20.509
Milk.

55:20.599 --> 55:24.015
Just like the sign said on the building
before you obliterated it.

55:24.103 --> 55:26.772
Fresh, wholesome milk.

55:26.855 --> 55:29.429
You probably love this stuff,
don't you?

55:29.525 --> 55:32.276
Vitamin D, calcium...

55:32.361 --> 55:35.481
essential for good strong bones
and healthy teeth.

55:35.572 --> 55:39.356
But that's probably all Greek to you,
isn't it, Mr Gingivitis?

55:42.663 --> 55:44.620
7:15 p.m.

55:44.706 --> 55:48.870
After explaining to the milk factory
they could not take legal action...

55:48.960 --> 55:50.953
since we had properly obtained
a search warrant...

55:51.046 --> 55:52.955
our apology was
reluctantly accepted...

55:53.048 --> 55:56.547
and Streebek and I were on
our way back to Parker Center.

55:56.634 --> 55:59.339
After losing two previous vehicles
we had been issued...

55:59.429 --> 56:02.050
the only car the department would
release to us at this point...

56:02.140 --> 56:05.057
was an unmarked 1987 Yugo...

56:05.143 --> 56:09.354
a Yugoslavian import donated
as a test vehicle by that country...

56:09.439 --> 56:13.187
and reflecting the cutting edge
of Serbo-Croatian technology.

56:49.478 --> 56:52.644
I've been thinking.
Maybe your informant was right.

56:52.731 --> 56:54.688
Maybe the Pagans anticipated our raid...

56:54.775 --> 56:57.348
and mixed those chemicals
into a deadly gas before we got there.

56:57.444 --> 57:00.113
Nuh-huh.

57:00.197 --> 57:02.652
- Friday?
- That's me.

57:02.741 --> 57:04.650
What do you like to do for fun?

57:06.077 --> 57:08.948
I'm your partner, and
I don't even know where you live.

57:09.038 --> 57:10.948
That's right, mister, you don't.

57:13.960 --> 57:17.210
Streebek, why are you always looking
at your watch?

57:17.297 --> 57:19.206
I'm watching my TV.

57:19.298 --> 57:23.841
You don't like my music, you don't want
to talk, so I'm watching my TV.

57:23.928 --> 57:25.885
We're at the Law and Order
Foundation dinner...

57:25.972 --> 57:30.052
where Los Angeles mayor, Peter Parvin,
is fighting for his political survival.

57:30.142 --> 57:34.057
Leading that attack again is
Police Commissioner Jane Kirkpatrick.

57:34.146 --> 57:36.554
Let's hear what she has to say.

57:36.649 --> 57:41.311
This rampaging gang of Pagans has made
a mockery of city administration.

57:41.403 --> 57:44.488
Vehicles from the fire and police
departments are stolen in daylight.

57:44.573 --> 57:49.912
Deadly toxic chemicals are on the loose.
What next, Mr Mayor?

57:49.995 --> 57:51.988
In my opinion...

57:52.080 --> 57:55.366
Mayor Parvin should consider
the welfare of his constituents...

57:55.459 --> 57:57.747
and do the honourable thing:

57:57.836 --> 57:59.710
Resign now.

58:02.674 --> 58:05.960
You know, I think you and the
commissioner would make a cute couple.

58:06.052 --> 58:08.010
You both keep your jaws locked.

58:08.096 --> 58:11.382
Plus you two share
that curious affection for hats.

58:11.474 --> 58:13.930
May I remind you that
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

58:14.019 --> 58:16.770
threatened to turn me
into a civilian?

58:16.855 --> 58:19.772
Yeah, I know.
There was a gleam in her eye, though.

58:19.858 --> 58:21.601
Put a clamp on it!

58:21.693 --> 58:24.777
I have never been elected
to public office.

58:24.862 --> 58:29.441
I have always sought the approval
of a somewhat higher power...

58:29.534 --> 58:31.028
for my actions.

58:31.119 --> 58:34.119
The sad truth...

58:34.205 --> 58:36.957
is that we live here now
in a city...

58:37.041 --> 58:41.121
where even a gross pornographer
like Jerry Caesar...

58:41.212 --> 58:44.415
is not immune from lawlessness!

58:44.507 --> 58:48.456
With this grim fact in mind...

58:48.552 --> 58:52.087
I am relieved to announce tonight...

58:52.181 --> 58:55.632
that even Mr Caesar himself
has bravely decided...

58:55.726 --> 58:58.762
to strike a blow in our common fight
against crime!

58:58.854 --> 59:00.811
Yes, sir! Yes, indeed!

59:02.399 --> 59:05.815
This guy knows God personally.
I hear they play racquetball together.

59:05.902 --> 59:09.318
Just chuckle away.
I don't hear God laughing.

59:09.406 --> 59:11.813
You will once He sees your haircut.

59:12.826 --> 59:17.571
My friends, in an unprecedented
gesture of atonement...

59:17.664 --> 59:21.448
Mr Caesar has agreed
to donate the sum...

59:21.543 --> 59:26.335
of $1 million

59:32.428 --> 59:35.513
After witnessing the raging political
turmoil on Streebek's puny TV...

59:35.598 --> 59:38.884
I was really looking forward
to the end of a rotten day.

59:38.976 --> 59:43.354
- Well, want to get something to eat?
- Not tonight. I have plans.

59:43.439 --> 59:46.974
You do? What? What?

59:47.068 --> 59:50.353
Where do you go? What is her name?
Does she have a sister?

59:50.446 --> 59:52.604
Good night, Streebek.

59:55.367 --> 59:58.571
Truth is, I don't care where you go.

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:04.747
Yeah, I do.
I gotta know.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.229
I knew it.

01:00:34.322 --> 01:00:36.813
It's Nightmare on Elm Street.

01:00:36.908 --> 01:00:40.573
- That would make him Freddie Krueger.

We're gonna be driving along some night
and the lighting's gonna be bad.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:48.668
He's gonna mistake me for some
pretty coed, and out comes that claw.

Who knows what kind of thrill-seeking
hose monster he's got stashed in there?

My God, he's dating Mother Goose!
Hey, Joe!

01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:17.611
Streebek, what are you doing here?

01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:21.067
- Who is this nice-Iooking young man?
- He's nobody.

01:01:21.159 --> 01:01:22.951
My partner.

01:01:23.036 --> 01:01:26.121
Streebek, introduce yourself
to my grandmother, quickly.

01:01:26.206 --> 01:01:29.789
Well, what a pleasant surprise.

01:01:29.876 --> 01:01:31.785
Granny Friday.

01:01:31.878 --> 01:01:35.378
She's my maternal grandmother.
Her name is Mundy.

01:01:36.675 --> 01:01:39.960
Why don't we discuss this over dinner?
It's my birthday.

01:01:40.053 --> 01:01:44.300
We're going to the Brown Derby.
Do join us, Detective Swayback.

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:46.300
- Streebek.
- Pep.

01:01:46.392 --> 01:01:48.385
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:01:49.145 --> 01:01:51.980
- Why not, Joe?
- Yeah, Joe, why not?

01:01:52.065 --> 01:01:57.403
I've invited someone already
to join us, and you don't know her.

01:01:57.487 --> 01:01:58.815
- Her?
- Her?

01:01:58.905 --> 01:02:02.108
Joe! You have a date?

01:02:07.204 --> 01:02:09.778
I'm so proud!

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:16.662
Well, it looks like
I have a date, too.

01:02:16.755 --> 01:02:19.875
Granny Mundy, may I escort you
to Joe's car?

01:02:19.967 --> 01:02:23.466
I'd be privileged,
Detective Startrek.

01:02:27.558 --> 01:02:31.686
9:00 p.m. Exactly one night after
witnessing the satanic cult rally...

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:36.266
I escorted my grandmother to her
favourite restaurant, the Brown Derby.

01:02:36.358 --> 01:02:41.185
There was someone I wanted her to meet,
and it wasn't Detective Streebek.

01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:43.687
Sergeant Friday, your table is ready.

01:02:43.782 --> 01:02:46.617
I took the liberty of pouring
the Dom Perignon.

01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:48.160
What Dom Perignon?

01:02:48.244 --> 01:02:52.491
I stopped and phoned in an order
in honour of Granny Mundy's birthday.

01:02:52.582 --> 01:02:55.618
You'd want her to have
the most expensive kind, wouldn't you?

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:59.708
What a thoughtful gesture!
Don't you think so, Joe?

01:02:59.797 --> 01:03:03.131
Yes, Granny.
It was very considerate of him.

01:03:12.351 --> 01:03:15.720
Hello, Joe.
Guess I'm early.

01:03:15.813 --> 01:03:17.722
I was kind of excited.

01:03:17.815 --> 01:03:19.891
You sly minx!

01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:24.445
I'd like you to meet my maternal
grandmother, Mrs. Grace Mundy.

Granny, this is
the virgin Connie Swail.

Hi.

01:03:31.995 --> 01:03:35.696
Well, allow me.

01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:38.116
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

01:03:40.671 --> 01:03:43.340
And if I may, a toast.

01:03:43.423 --> 01:03:44.882
To Granny Mundy.

01:03:44.966 --> 01:03:48.170
May you live as long as you want
but never want as long as you live.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.639
Hear! Hear!

01:03:55.018 --> 01:03:57.591
Ahhh.

01:03:57.687 --> 01:03:59.929
This is such a happy restaurant.

01:04:00.023 --> 01:04:03.024
Commissioner Kirkpatrick,
how nice to see you again.

01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:05.600
Reverend Whirley,
it's a privilege.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.690
An aperitif, perhaps?

01:04:09.782 --> 01:04:13.116
I once saw Alan Hale, Jr. In here.

01:04:13.202 --> 01:04:16.737
Alan Hale, Jr! Wow!
"Gilligan, little buddy!"

01:04:16.831 --> 01:04:21.623
Don't order anything more expensive than
the Cobb salad. That is an order.

01:04:21.711 --> 01:04:24.462
Oh, my God!

01:04:24.547 --> 01:04:26.954
- Connie?
- That's him.

01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:29.208
That man with the collar.

01:04:29.301 --> 01:04:31.211
The Reverend Whirley?

01:04:31.303 --> 01:04:34.803
He's the one who kidnapped me
and threw me in that pit...

01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:37.049
with that horrible snake.

01:04:38.185 --> 01:04:41.139
I'll never forget his face
as long as I live.

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:43.851
You have to be sure about this.

01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:46.811
How about very, very sure?

01:04:46.902 --> 01:04:49.274
I'm positive, Joe.

01:04:49.363 --> 01:04:51.236
That's him.

01:04:51.323 --> 01:04:53.280
The face behind the mask.

01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:57.483
The man who tried to kill me.

01:05:00.874 --> 01:05:03.910
Would you testify to that under oath
in a court of law?

01:05:04.002 --> 01:05:06.754
Wait a minute. Settle down.

01:05:06.838 --> 01:05:10.123
Let's think about this.
That is Jonathan Whirley.

01:05:10.216 --> 01:05:13.502
Head of the Moral Advance Movement
of America. He's a public hero.

01:05:13.595 --> 01:05:17.426
- You can't just walk up to him...
- Streebek.

Vermin aren't allowed
inside restaurants.

01:05:19.767 --> 01:05:21.926
I'll be enforcing
the public health code.

01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:25.930
If you'll both excuse me...

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:29.523
I'm afraid
the second-highest duty calls.

01:05:34.782 --> 01:05:38.317
Joe, he is sitting with the commissioner
and our captain.

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:41.862
Bust him now, tomorrow you'll
be mucking out stalls at Horse Patrol.

01:05:49.213 --> 01:05:50.623
Thank you.

01:05:52.674 --> 01:05:54.085
I am sorry.

01:05:54.176 --> 01:05:57.130
Hold it there, Whirley. Police Officer.
You're under arrest.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.628
I beg your pardon?
Is this some sort of feeble joke?

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:05.393
Oh, it's a knee-slapper, if you consider
Penal Codes 484207 A597 and 217...

01:06:05.479 --> 01:06:08.266
theft, kidnapping, cruelty to animals,
attempted murder things to laugh about.

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:10.854
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:06:10.942 --> 01:06:13.729
My partner and I witnessed
that torchlight picnic you threw.

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.485
We're gonna put you where your kind
always ends up: In a 7-by-7 cage...

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:21.903
in some hundred-year-old penitentiary
with a wooden plank for a bed.

01:06:21.995 --> 01:06:25.446
Sure, this city isn't perfect. We need
a smut-free life for all our citizens.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.828
Cleaner streets, better schools,
a good hockey team.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:31.915
But the difference between you and me is
you made the promise, I'm gonna keep it.

01:06:45.893 --> 01:06:49.807
Our good reverend's an amazing
piece of work, isn't he, Jane?

01:06:49.897 --> 01:06:52.981
- May I call you Jane?
- No.

01:07:00.908 --> 01:07:03.149
Captain, Commissioner...

01:07:03.243 --> 01:07:06.280
I demand an immediate explanation
for this outrageous behaviour.

01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:08.494
It's him again.

01:07:08.582 --> 01:07:10.989
Are you insane?

01:07:11.084 --> 01:07:14.833
Reverend Whirley abducted that girl,
had his men throw her in a pit...

01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:17.792
filled with polluted water
and a giant Bolivian jungle snake.

01:07:17.883 --> 01:07:20.552
These accusations are preposterous!

01:07:20.635 --> 01:07:24.419
I beg to differ. Ask him if he remembers
3,000 gallons of stolen...

01:07:24.514 --> 01:07:27.515
trichlornitromethane and the
pseudo-halogenic compound cyanogen...

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.723
which, when mixed properly,
form a liquid fertilizer that burns...

01:07:29.811 --> 01:07:33.346
the throat, eyes, lungs, and nose,
and could cause vomiting and death.

01:07:33.439 --> 01:07:36.191
We're just about to eat here!

01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:40.107
Reverend Whirley, please accept
our most sincere apologies.

01:07:40.196 --> 01:07:43.363
Sergeant, you will remove
those handcuffs immediately.

01:07:43.449 --> 01:07:46.320
Then you will hand in your badge.
You are relieved from duty.

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:47.952
But... But...
But, Commissioner...

01:07:48.037 --> 01:07:49.531
Now!

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.663
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

01:07:53.751 --> 01:07:57.001
I don't care.
I'm absolutely humiliated.

01:07:57.087 --> 01:08:01.132
I know the young man was overzealous,
but he springs from a great tradition.

01:08:01.216 --> 01:08:04.502
Commissioner, won't you please
change your mind?

01:08:16.481 --> 01:08:20.064
I'm afraid I'll have to take
your badge and gun.

01:08:20.152 --> 01:08:24.196
- If we could just please...
- I don't want to discuss it!

01:08:24.281 --> 01:08:26.902
Just hand them over.

01:08:56.979 --> 01:09:02.020
Look, Joe, don't worry. I'm still
on active duty. I'm building a case.

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:04.398
You're building nothin'.

01:09:04.487 --> 01:09:08.649
If I ever hear you've come
within one mile of Reverend Whirley...

01:09:08.741 --> 01:09:10.733
I'll have your badge for breakfast!

01:09:10.826 --> 01:09:13.946
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:22.045 --> 01:09:26.125
It was very nice of you to try
and take us out to dinner, Joe.

01:09:26.216 --> 01:09:29.965
Yeah. Thanks, Joe, for everything.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:36.631
Let's not stand around here moping.
I'm hungry! Let's go for chili dogs.

01:09:36.725 --> 01:09:42.064
Granny, have you ever eaten a chili dog
off the back of a motorcycle?

01:09:42.148 --> 01:09:44.057
Not till now.

01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:47.602
You smooth-talking son of a gun.

01:09:57.663 --> 01:10:00.581
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:08.458
I'm very sorry
you lost your job, Joe.

01:10:08.549 --> 01:10:10.838
I really did have
a very good time.

01:10:10.926 --> 01:10:13.133
I'm glad, Connie.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.257
Now, fasten your seat belt.
I can still effect a citizen's arrest.

01:10:16.348 --> 01:10:19.682
I don't want to ruin a wonderful evening
by bringing you in on a misdemeanour.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.846
That was a joke.

01:10:23.981 --> 01:10:26.306
Oh.

01:10:40.997 --> 01:10:43.204
Oh, Joe!

01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:45.284
Look at the stars!

01:10:45.377 --> 01:10:47.535
Dozens of them.

01:10:49.923 --> 01:10:54.134
You know, when I was a little girl...

01:10:54.219 --> 01:10:57.173
I used to wish upon
a different star every night...

01:10:57.263 --> 01:11:00.679
for that special someone to come along.

01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:03.388
Someone with whom
I could share...

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.556
everything.

01:11:12.111 --> 01:11:14.519
I guess that's not so unusual.

01:11:15.448 --> 01:11:19.030
All girls do that, don't they, Joe?

01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:21.739
Some guys do, too, Connie.

01:11:25.541 --> 01:11:27.913
- Joe?
- That's me.

01:11:29.503 --> 01:11:31.412
Was there ever...

01:11:34.174 --> 01:11:35.585
anyone else?

01:11:35.676 --> 01:11:37.503
Of course there was.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.589
Oh.

01:11:40.681 --> 01:11:44.512
Actually, I've only been driving
with Streebek a couple of days.

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:47.851
- Before that I was with Frank.
- That's not what I meant.

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:13.454
- [Banging]
- [Screaming]

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:16.381
Goodness! Earthquake! It's the big one!

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:18.791
Joe, help!

01:12:18.885 --> 01:12:20.509
Request Code 3.
Officer in distress.

01:12:20.595 --> 01:12:23.382
Assist officer.
I'll handle this. Calm down.

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:29.258
- [Gasping]
- [Shotgun Pump Clicking]

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.272
January 9, 8:37 a.m.

01:12:32.356 --> 01:12:35.061
My name's Streebek.
I'm a cop.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.561
I overslept.

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:43.483
Curiously enough, I still hadn't heard
from my anal-retentive ex-partner...

01:12:43.575 --> 01:12:46.825
although I was sure he'd be proud to
know I was making a concerted effort...

01:12:46.912 --> 01:12:49.284
to personally develop
a close relationship...

01:12:49.373 --> 01:12:52.742
with one of my sisters
in the Los Angeles Police Department.

01:13:15.315 --> 01:13:17.984
I placed a call
to the virgin Connie Swail...

01:13:18.067 --> 01:13:21.234
but according to the girl's mother,
she hadn't come home either.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.156
I don't know what to say, Mrs. Swail.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.861
I'm beginning to be concerned myself.

01:13:26.951 --> 01:13:30.901
No, Joe Friday has never
stayed out all night, either.

01:13:30.997 --> 01:13:34.615
The day he was born,
his mother had him home by 9:00.

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:38.789
Well, let's both stay in touch
in case we hear from them.

01:13:38.879 --> 01:13:40.919
Thank you, Mrs. Swail.

01:13:44.093 --> 01:13:47.010
Oh, my goodness.
I'm gonna be late for my stake-out.

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.173
As enchanting as Robin was...

01:13:50.265 --> 01:13:54.263
I still couldn't get my mind off
what happened to Joe Friday.

01:13:54.353 --> 01:13:56.641
For one misguided moment...

01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:00.063
I actually pictured my ex-partner
introducing that little cupcake...

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:04.148
to the one piece of equipment that
wasn't issued to him by the department.

01:14:04.237 --> 01:14:08.864
But then I realized Joe would never
spring for the price of a motel room.

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:12.533
And since having sex in a Yugo
was a logistical impossibility...

01:14:12.621 --> 01:14:15.824
I came to the conclusion
that something must be wrong.

01:14:15.915 --> 01:14:17.575
Who cares?

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:19.541
Listen to me, Captain.

01:14:19.627 --> 01:14:22.712
Joe Friday was the most dedicated cop
in this city.

01:14:22.797 --> 01:14:25.751
Okay, so maybe all his dogs
aren't attached to one leash.

01:14:25.842 --> 01:14:28.463
He's thickheaded, insensitive
and reactionary.

01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:32.087
And generally less fun to be around
than any person I've ever met.

01:14:32.181 --> 01:14:35.016
Still, he was my partner.

01:14:35.101 --> 01:14:37.556
You want to find Joe Friday?

01:14:37.645 --> 01:14:41.725
My advice is to start checking out
the sanitariums.

01:14:43.401 --> 01:14:45.310
- Hey, Pep.
- What's shaking?

01:14:45.403 --> 01:14:47.775
- Hey, you!
- Me, Pep?

01:14:48.864 --> 01:14:51.272
Detective Streebek to you.
Let's get this mop trimmed.

01:14:51.367 --> 01:14:53.443
Stop shaving with a pocketknife,
and next time you eat your lunch...

01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:55.445
put it in your stomach,
not on your uniform.

01:14:55.537 --> 01:14:58.372
You're a disgrace to this department
and that badge.

01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:16.382
You're late, Jerry.

01:15:18.059 --> 01:15:22.805
I saw your announcement about my
so-called million-dollar contribution.

01:15:22.897 --> 01:15:24.973
Do yourself a favour, friend.

01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:27.818
Try the lottery.

01:15:27.902 --> 01:15:29.859
The lottery I can fix.

01:15:29.946 --> 01:15:32.235
Our problem is Mayor Parvin.

01:15:32.323 --> 01:15:36.570
I'm afraid he is not
"going gentle into that good night."

01:15:36.661 --> 01:15:38.072
Say what?

01:15:38.162 --> 01:15:42.207
That he is not responding
to our pressure to resign.

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:44.961
We're gonna have to push him
over the edge.

01:15:45.044 --> 01:15:49.291
Your million-dollar contribution
will insure his presence at your party.

01:15:49.382 --> 01:15:54.008
Just make sure he turns into
a drug-crazed idiot, with pictures.

01:15:54.095 --> 01:15:56.846
Once he's politically dead,
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

01:15:56.931 --> 01:15:59.303
will be a shoo-in to replace him
in the next election.

01:15:59.391 --> 01:16:02.843
You and I will split control
of the city.

01:16:02.936 --> 01:16:05.095
You will monopolize all pornography.

01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:08.854
Half the poor dumb sheep in Los Angeles
will be forking over money...

01:16:08.942 --> 01:16:10.982
to buy your sleaze...

01:16:11.069 --> 01:16:13.857
while the other half will be funding me
with the means to fight it.

01:16:15.365 --> 01:16:16.776
Reverend...

01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:20.524
you got balls as big as church bells.

01:16:22.122 --> 01:16:23.664
Thank you.

01:16:40.473 --> 01:16:44.222
Jonathan, I do not trust that man.

01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:47.228
Thank goodness he trusts me.

01:16:47.313 --> 01:16:49.602
That socially-retarded hedonist...

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:53.142
actually believes he's going
to be alive tomorrow.

01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:32.015
Where's Joe Friday?

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:47.072
It's no use.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:49.072
These knots are too tight.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.738
Untie the girl.
She's coming with me.

01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:58.625
You hypocrite. If you were decent,
you'd let her go and kill me instead.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.127
Instead?

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:06.587
But, my dear Sergeant Friday,
I'd always planned on killing you.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:09.352
How do you see yourself
going down in history?

01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:11.760
Pagan or reverend,
devil or angel?

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:15.187
Why, both, of course.

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:17.599
One can't exist without the other.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:20.563
Without the Jerry Caesars,
there'd be no moral outrage.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:22.813
What's the good of moral outrage...

01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:26.110
unless you have something tangible
to direct it against?

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.871
By this time tomorrow,
thanks to that poison gas...

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.659
you've been tracking
like some flu-ridden bloodhound...

01:18:31.748 --> 01:18:35.663
Mr Caesar will be sitting
in that big Jacuzzi in the sky...

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.160
and I'll control both sides
of the equation.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:41.671
Sure, but like every other psycho
in this city with a foolproof plan...

01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:44.629
you've forgotten you're facing the
finest fighting force ever assembled.

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:47.506
The Israelis?

01:18:47.597 --> 01:18:50.349
Try the decent, hardworking
men and women of Los Angeles.

01:18:52.435 --> 01:18:54.724
Forgotten about them?

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:57.019
My dear Sergeant...

01:18:57.106 --> 01:19:00.558
I'm absolutely counting on them.

01:19:02.987 --> 01:19:04.944
- Joe.
- [Whirley Laughs]

01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:07.189
Joe?

01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:46.480
[Friday] You may have taken a wrong turn,
but there's time to straighten out.

01:19:46.571 --> 01:19:48.860
You're the one that's gonna
straighten out, cop...

01:19:48.949 --> 01:19:50.858
all the way down the mountain.

01:19:55.288 --> 01:19:56.699
Let's go, Streebek.

01:20:26.444 --> 01:20:29.017
Just relax and hold on tight.

01:20:29.113 --> 01:20:32.446
Tighter!
Pretend I'm Connie. Ooh!

01:20:34.285 --> 01:20:36.111
Look out! Look out!

01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:43.454
There's no road here.

01:20:45.671 --> 01:20:48.126
No road. Look out!

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.767
Look, there's the mayor.

01:21:02.854 --> 01:21:05.725
Pretty clever of Whirley manoeuvring
him up here to Caesar's party.

01:21:05.815 --> 01:21:08.057
