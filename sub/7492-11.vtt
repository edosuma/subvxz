WEBVTT

00:02.959 --> 00:04.458
<i>And here they come.</i>

00:04.542 --> 00:07.041
<i>Give it up for your gymnastics team,</i>

00:07.125 --> 00:10.041
<i>the Seaford Killer Whales!</i>

00:16.417 --> 00:18.417
Whoo! Looking good, Kim.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.667
All right.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.125
I really want to thank you, Jack.

00:24.208 --> 00:28.166
You've been the rock that's gotten me
through my terrible breakup with Julie.

00:28.375 --> 00:29.834
You were going out with Julie?

00:30.583 --> 00:33.458
Yes. Why do you think I've been sitting
in the locker room crying?

00:33.542 --> 00:35.875
I don't know.
I thought you had some jockstrap issue.

00:37.083 --> 00:39.917
Listen, I'm sure Julie's going through
the same tough time you are.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.417
You're right.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.208
I'll bet she's at home crying her--

00:44.291 --> 00:45.917
Holy Christmas nuts!

00:46.000 --> 00:48.542
She's over there kissing Tommy Didier!

00:48.917 --> 00:51.834
There is something called
a grieving period, you know!

00:51.917 --> 00:52.792
Hey, come on.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.792
Try and take your mind off of it.

00:54.875 --> 00:56.208
Look, Kim's up.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.709
Wow, she is good.

01:15.625 --> 01:16.750
Yeah!

01:18.083 --> 01:20.000
This is great.
Half their team has food poisoning.

01:20.083 --> 01:22.834
Tori, all you have to do
is complete one vault, and we win!

01:22.917 --> 01:23.750
I got this.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.083
Next time you see me,

01:25.166 --> 01:28.625
we'll be at Steven Sullivan's house
sipping celebration smoothies.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.250
It's gonna be sick.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.709
Tori, will you stop talking
about smoothies?

01:32.792 --> 01:34.834
Okay, just get out there and focus!

01:35.083 --> 01:36.917
I mean, focus.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.667
What...

01:49.542 --> 01:51.500
You know, Kim, if you quit now

01:51.583 --> 01:54.041
you won't have to go up against
my undefeated Swathmore team

01:54.125 --> 01:55.166
this Saturday.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.583
We're not afraid

01:56.667 --> 01:58.875
of your Swathmore team, Claire.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.000
Our coach has taught us
that we are not quitters.

02:02.083 --> 02:03.208
We are winners!

02:03.291 --> 02:05.250
All right, losers, I quit.

Good, good.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.959
I don't believe it, Rudy.
Are you still hiding from your landlord?

03:01.041 --> 03:02.166
Yes, I am.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.667
Unless Ratface gives
that rent increase in writing,

03:04.750 --> 03:05.709
it's not official.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.792
A guy just delivered that.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.083
Oh, sweet.

03:11.041 --> 03:14.375
Ohh! He got me.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.875
"This notice is to inform you

03:16.959 --> 03:19.250
that your monthly rent
has been increased by $600.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.875
Seaford Mall Management."

03:21.583 --> 03:23.125
Wait, he actually put the letter in there?

03:23.250 --> 03:25.583
No. The sneak wrote it in anchovies.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.625
Hey, Kim. Any luck finding a new coach?

03:31.709 --> 03:33.959
Not a bit.
I begged every adult that I know.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.166
I got five polite no's, three blank looks,

03:36.250 --> 03:38.709
and Officer Joan laughed so hard
she ripped one.

03:39.625 --> 03:40.834
Well, I got you something.

03:40.917 --> 03:42.250
I hope it makes you feel better.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.375
What--
A ticket for the US Gymnastics tour?

03:45.458 --> 03:47.208
It's for tomorrow
at the Seaford Civic Center.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.458
Oh, thanks, Jack.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.208
But I'm holding gymnastics tryouts
tomorrow.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.542
I mean, if I don't find a new team,
then we forfeit to Swathmore,

03:52.625 --> 03:53.542
and that will not happen.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.166
I'll take the ticket.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.750
I don't have much of a life right now

03:56.834 --> 03:58.792
since Julie and I broke up.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.000
You were going out with Julie?

04:01.166 --> 04:03.083
I called you when we broke up.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.750
I cried for three hours.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.625
Don't you remember?

04:06.917 --> 04:08.875
To be honest,
I put the phone in the sock drawer

04:08.959 --> 04:10.291
and went to the movies.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.375
Gah!

04:13.709 --> 04:15.208
Hey, Joan. We haven't seen you in a while.

04:15.291 --> 04:16.458
- Where you been?
- Jail.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.834
Got a little side job
at the Seaford Correctional Facility

04:20.917 --> 04:22.875
teaching the inmates about proper hygiene.

04:22.959 --> 04:26.500
I use this puppet to remind them
about staying clean.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.959
Well, that's so nice
that you volunteer, Joan.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.250
Yeah, it is.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.750
And they pay this volunteer 600 bucks.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.583
Six hundred bucks?

04:34.667 --> 04:37.000
That's exactly what I need
to cover my rent.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.250
They're always looking for new programs.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.542
Hey, Joan.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.667
Let's go out to the food court
and hit on the hot guys.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.875
Man.

04:44.959 --> 04:48.041
This puppet's the best wingman I ever had.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.125
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

04:53.208 --> 04:54.458
So, um...

04:55.041 --> 04:56.375
Our coach isn't coming back.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.417
But the good news is

05:01.500 --> 05:04.000
I have decided to step up
and fill that role.

05:06.959 --> 05:08.500
Yeah. Good!

05:08.583 --> 05:10.417
We just weeded out the wannabes.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.000
Okay, look, I know there is not much time,

05:13.083 --> 05:14.875
but if we are willing to work hard,

05:14.959 --> 05:16.291
I'm sure that there is--

05:23.250 --> 05:24.250
Okay.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.917
We do not need them, okay?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.834
You may not be
the classic gymnastics type,

05:28.917 --> 05:31.417
but I bet inside of you there is a champ--

05:31.500 --> 05:34.208
You're just here for the paninis,
aren't you?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.625
Got any ranch dressing?

05:37.625 --> 05:38.709
Give me those.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.667
Hey, prison peeps!

05:45.750 --> 05:48.083
I got a rap about hygiene

05:48.166 --> 05:50.458
if you'd like to hear it.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.375
I love a good hygiene rap.

05:53.709 --> 05:55.959
Well then, hit it, Joan.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.750
<i>♪ Being a friend is just being nice ♪</i>

06:01.834 --> 06:04.041

06:04.125 --> 06:06.125

06:09.625 --> 06:10.834
Man.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.250
That puppet all right.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.166
Uh-oh.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.917
Every performer knows
you can't follow a rapping puppet.

06:20.041 --> 06:22.083
These guys are real inmates.
What if they hate us?

06:22.166 --> 06:23.250
Rudy, relax.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.500
Just don't show them fear
and they'll respect you.

06:25.583 --> 06:26.500
That's good.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.083
That's good.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.250
Rudy, where are you going?

06:31.333 --> 06:32.500
<i>And now...</i>

06:32.583 --> 06:34.750
Let's give my friends Jack and Rudy

06:34.834 --> 06:38.959
a nice, warm prison welcome, huh?

06:42.583 --> 06:44.542
Thank you. Thank you.

06:45.041 --> 06:46.125
Hey, guys, uh...

06:46.208 --> 06:47.208
I'm Jack,

06:47.417 --> 06:49.250
and the program that we,

06:49.875 --> 06:52.625
or I guess I will be showing you today

06:52.709 --> 06:54.875
will teach you meditative techniques.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.000
Welcome to "Zen in the Pen."

06:58.959 --> 07:00.750
You got a puppet, boy?

07:02.166 --> 07:04.583
We don't need no puppet.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.083
We gonna relax old school.

07:08.417 --> 07:11.208
I said relax, homes.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.667
Hey. Chill out.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.375
Don't you tell me to chill out, Carl!

07:15.458 --> 07:16.583
I am from the streets!

07:16.667 --> 07:17.834
What street you from?

07:17.917 --> 07:20.458
Apple Berry Lane, yo!

07:22.166 --> 07:24.792
Okay, class is over.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.041
- Everyone back to their cells.
- Get.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.583
Wait, wait! No.
I'm nothing like these monsters.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.458
I'm from Apple Berry Lane!

07:31.542 --> 07:33.333
Apple Berry Lane!

07:36.542 --> 07:39.208
Kim, you are not gonna believe
what happened

07:39.291 --> 07:40.583
at the gymnastics tour today.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.792
I told a girl about your situation,

07:42.875 --> 07:46.083
and she agreed to coach your team
for the Swathmore meet.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.375
Um, thanks, Milton.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.000
But do you really think
I want to be coached

07:50.083 --> 07:52.041
by some pimply-faced, wannabe gymnast

07:52.125 --> 07:53.709
you met in the nosebleed section?

07:53.792 --> 07:54.875
No.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.834
But how about Olympic gold medalist
Gabby Douglas?

07:58.792 --> 08:00.125
Get out.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.083
I'm serious. I talked to her.

08:03.166 --> 08:06.667
She has a couple days off from the tour
and she agreed to help you.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.834
Get out!

08:09.709 --> 08:11.667
Oh, Gabby!

08:14.959 --> 08:16.542
Hi. You must be Kim.

08:16.625 --> 08:17.542
I'm Gabby.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.041
Get out!

08:21.083 --> 08:22.041
Okay.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.125
No, no, no.
Come back, come back, come back!

08:31.959 --> 08:35.041
I can't believe <i>the</i> Gabby Douglas
is standing in our dojo!

08:37.166 --> 08:38.250
Kim, relax.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.959
You're freaking out
in front of my girlfriend.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.291
You're right, I'm sorry. It's just--
Your who what now?

08:42.583 --> 08:43.709
That's right.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.125
Gabby's my girlfriend, Kim.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.291
It happened this afternoon.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.500
After my dismount,

08:48.583 --> 08:51.333
I looked up into the crowd and saw Milton.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.417
I just couldn't resist
my little ginger cookie.

08:53.542 --> 08:54.583
Oh.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.291
The first time our eyes met--

08:57.375 --> 08:58.709
Yeah, yeah. Great story.

08:59.875 --> 09:02.291
So you're really gonna coach our team?

09:02.417 --> 09:03.291
Yeah.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.125
When I was in school,
our coach walked out,

09:05.208 --> 09:06.583
so I know what it's like.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.709
Oh, hey guys.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.208
Oh, Jack, Rudy.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.500
Meet Gabby Douglas.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.250
I watched you during the Olympics.
It's such an honor to meet you.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.458
Thank you.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.583
Uh, I don't know what kind of game
you're playing here, missy.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.792
But you are not the real Gabby Douglas.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.542
Yeah, I am.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.417
- Rudy, it's her.
- Yeah, Rudy, it's actually her.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.583
Okay, fine.

09:25.667 --> 09:26.750
I'll prove it's not her.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.333
You people are so gullible.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.083
You're never gonna believe this.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.083
Gabby Douglas is in our dojo!

09:41.166 --> 09:42.583
Would you sign this?

09:42.667 --> 09:44.959
Just write, "To my fellow champion,

09:45.041 --> 09:46.291
much like the Olympic flame--"

09:46.375 --> 09:47.667
I'll just sign it "Gabby."

09:47.750 --> 09:49.917
Simple, powerful. Totally the way to go.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.208
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

09:56.875 --> 09:59.583
That was really good, Donna.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.500
Just don't forget to kick out
a little earlier so you can stick it.

10:02.583 --> 10:03.959
Stick it. Okay, you heard her.

10:04.041 --> 10:04.917
Stick it, girl!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.959
You wanna lose to Swathmore
because you didn't stick it?

10:08.500 --> 10:10.583
- Kim. Relax.
-

10:10.667 --> 10:11.959
We're in pretty good shape.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.125
And we have somebody for every event.

10:14.208 --> 10:15.333
Not the rings.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.583
Ring, ring, who's there? Nobody!

10:20.750 --> 10:22.500
Hide me. Lenore's after me.

10:22.583 --> 10:23.709
She caught me comforting Carol.

10:23.792 --> 10:24.792
Oh, my.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.041
Where'd he go?

10:31.125 --> 10:32.583
He just disappeared.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.750
That was close, yo.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.208
I've had to hide from a lot of women, Kim.

10:50.542 --> 10:53.125
Ring, ring. Who's there? Jerry.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.125
The newest member of our team.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.667
Use your bodies
to release negative energy.

11:04.750 --> 11:08.875
And attain a total state of freedom.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.375
All right, back to your cages!

11:11.500 --> 11:13.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.542
We still got 15 minutes.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.250
What's 15 minutes when you're doing life,
am I right?

11:19.500 --> 11:23.041
Uh, sorry, we're going down
to the Seaford Civic Center

11:23.125 --> 11:24.500
to support the gymnastics team.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.250
Yeah, they're being coached
by my very dear, dear,

11:27.375 --> 11:29.125
dear friend Gabby Douglas.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.667
Gabby Douglas?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.583
Two-time Olympic gold medalist?

11:32.667 --> 11:34.542
And my dear friend.

11:34.959 --> 11:36.583
She's gonna bring her medals to the meet.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.333
I'm gonna get a picture of me
wearing them.

11:38.417 --> 11:39.917
Oh, man. You gonna use that picture

11:40.000 --> 11:42.291
to make everybody think
you won that gold medal.

11:42.792 --> 11:43.875
That's low.

11:43.959 --> 11:46.291
Hey, show a little respect.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.458
You're talking to a man who's won...

11:49.125 --> 11:51.333
Two Oscars, a Nobel Peace Prize,

11:51.375 --> 11:52.667
and the Heisman.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.709
All right. Time's up.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.125
Everyone out of here.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.583
- Hey, Milton.
- Hey, Joan.

12:17.667 --> 12:18.792
Ha, ha!

12:20.875 --> 12:23.125
Julie's over there with Tommy.

12:24.834 --> 12:28.041
Probably make her nuts
to know you're going out with Gabby, huh?

12:35.250 --> 12:36.917
See these gold medals?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.250
They belong to my girlfriend,
Gabby Douglas.

12:40.375 --> 12:41.917
Oh, you heard me, Julie.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.208
Gabby's my girlfriend!

12:44.250 --> 12:45.875
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:45.959 --> 12:48.583
please welcome Gabby Douglas.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.041
My girlfriend!

13:27.166 --> 13:28.125
Kim.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.417
Claire.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.208
Wow, I can't believe it.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.333
You showed up.

13:33.417 --> 13:34.834
That is so brave.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.125
To lose in front of all these people.

13:38.583 --> 13:39.792
We're not gonna lose.

13:40.041 --> 13:42.166
Because Gabby Douglas is our new coach.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.417
<i>What?</i>

13:44.500 --> 13:45.917
- Are you serious?
- Oh, that's right.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.125
Today's the day we wipe

13:47.208 --> 13:50.000
that stupid Swathmore smile
off your snooty face.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.291
Get ready for it.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.291
What are you doing?

13:56.959 --> 13:57.875
Boom!

13:57.959 --> 13:58.834
That's right.

13:58.917 --> 14:01.000
Boom goes the dynamite!

14:01.083 --> 14:02.000
Boom!

14:02.083 --> 14:03.458
She boomed me.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.250
She boomed <i>me.</i> I mean, who does that?

14:06.333 --> 14:08.208
That's right, girl.
You're in the whale house now.

14:08.250 --> 14:09.667
You hear me? The whale--

14:10.458 --> 14:12.166
What is wrong with you?

14:12.250 --> 14:14.125
We have to win. You think we're gonna win?

14:14.208 --> 14:17.250
I think we're gonna win.
What if we don't win? We have to win!

14:18.750 --> 14:20.625
Hold up there, Hoppy Hopperson.

14:21.834 --> 14:24.959
Couldn't help but notice
your bu-dump-ah-dump-a-dump-eow.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.542
And then you threw in
a whippity-whippity-whippity-whippity-oop.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.625
You know, and you followed it up
with a flipper-doodle.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.834
-
- I'm sorry. Who are you?

14:31.917 --> 14:33.458
Oh, the name's Joan.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.750
Of course, in my gymnastics days,

14:35.834 --> 14:37.583
they used to call me the Flying Beaver.

14:37.667 --> 14:38.709
Check it.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.208
<i>-</i>

14:56.583 --> 14:57.792
Do you need help?

14:57.875 --> 14:59.041
Ah, no.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.500
That's why they call me the Beaver.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.333
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

15:05.417 --> 15:06.709
Dude, this is awesome.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.208
We made 600 bucks.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.959
Yeah. And they say crime doesn't pay.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.917
Hey, Tony, it's Carl.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.083
Carl from jail.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.083
The guy on the top bunk.

15:35.542 --> 15:36.709
Listen, I'm out.

15:36.792 --> 15:39.792
Get the boys together
and meet me at Seaford Civic Center.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.667
We're about to bring home the gold.

16:06.792 --> 16:09.792
Yes! In your face, Claire.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.417
When they announce the winner
and everyone's cheering,

16:15.500 --> 16:17.333
we'll replace the real security guards,

16:17.417 --> 16:19.667
and we'll walk right out
with Gabby's medals.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.500
Way to go, Tiffany.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.208
You see that, Kim?

16:29.291 --> 16:31.333
Tiff just scored a 9.7,

16:31.417 --> 16:35.000
which means you need a perfect routine
if you're going to beat us.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.000
Perfect.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.667
All I have to do is be perfect.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.417
If I'm perfect, we win.
If I'm not perfect, we lose.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.625
Perfect, just perfect!

16:46.709 --> 16:48.875
Kim! Calm down.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.625
It's not the end of the world
if you don't win.

16:51.709 --> 16:54.208
Yeah, easy for you to say.
You won gold medals.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.709
I'm proud of my gold medals,

16:55.792 --> 16:59.166
but I also have something else
that's just as important.

17:00.834 --> 17:03.041
A Happy Town Arcade token?

17:03.125 --> 17:04.208
Yeah.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.500
When my grandfather
would pick me up from practice,

17:06.583 --> 17:09.000
he would take me to
the Happy Town Arcade to play games.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.208
Well, how did that help your gymnastics?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.333
It didn't.

17:12.417 --> 17:14.000
But he wanted to teach me

17:14.083 --> 17:18.000
that there had to be a balance
between hard work and having fun.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.250
You know what, Gabby? You're right.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.375
I'm just gonna go out there and have fun.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.208
Yeah. You know what I love to do
before I compete?

17:28.250 --> 17:29.792
- What?
- I put on some music.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.166
Kind of shake things out a bit.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.583
You know? Get loose.

17:32.667 --> 17:33.959
Okay.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.083
Okay.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.542
I think you're loose enough.

18:32.583 --> 18:33.750
Ooh!

18:48.959 --> 18:50.792
Rudy, Rudy. Rudy, Rudy.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.000
Check it out. It's Carl.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.250
<i>Oh, would you look at that?</i>

18:54.333 --> 18:57.000
He got out of jail,
landed a job as a security guard,

18:57.083 --> 18:58.667
and now he's helping Gabby
move her medals.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.166
I knew I made a difference in his life.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.250
Rudy, he's stealing them.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.375
Oh. That makes so much more sense.

19:08.458 --> 19:09.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.750
Put the medals down, Carl.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.834
-
The medals!

19:31.375 --> 19:32.667
- That was fast.
- Not bad.

19:34.959 --> 19:36.834
- That was pretty fast too.
- That was pretty good.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.375
-
- Pretty good, dude.

19:47.041 --> 19:48.709
All right.

19:48.792 --> 19:51.000
You guys got the medals back.

19:51.083 --> 19:53.959
A black belt sensei
should probably guard these.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.291
Wow, Kim.

19:58.375 --> 19:59.667
That was awesome.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.875
Hey, judges.
What do you give that takedown?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.375
Now that was fun.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.458
I've been to thousands
of gymnastics meets,

20:13.542 --> 20:14.792
but I'll never forget this one.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.333
And I'll never forget you, Gabby.

20:16.417 --> 20:17.917
<i>Hey, Gabby.</i>

20:18.000 --> 20:20.250
Want to take a pic
with the real winning team?

20:21.083 --> 20:22.208
Definitely.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.792
Squeeze in, guys. Let's get a pic.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.834
- Come on.
Okay. Ready?

20:29.917 --> 20:32.166
And one, two, three!

20:32.250 --> 20:34.291
<i>-
- ♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

20:38.917 --> 20:41.417
Of all the gym joints in all the world,

20:41.500 --> 20:43.417
you had to tumble into mine.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.125
So my bus leaves in an hour.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.750
Any chance of you coming with me?

20:48.166 --> 20:49.959
I'd only slow you down.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.125
Don't be silly.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.917
No, I'm serious.

20:53.250 --> 20:56.375
I get carsick, airsick, seasick.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.792
If it moves, I've blown chunks on it.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.709
So I guess this is...

21:01.542 --> 21:02.458
goodbye.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.333
What a woman.

21:21.834 --> 21:22.875
Don't worry, Milton.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.250
She'll be back.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.250
Because true love conquers all?

21:26.333 --> 21:27.458
Nope.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.417
'Cause I still have her medals.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.750
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.750 --> 22:02.667
<i>Yes!</i>
