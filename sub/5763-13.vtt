00:00.067 --> 00:02.000
Previously on Ghost Whisperer.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.500
You move between the world of life and death.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.667
You don't know the price.

00:06.734 --> 00:08.234
What price?

00:09.567 --> 00:12.367
No! please, not you!

00:12.434 --> 00:13.634
You have to cross over.

00:13.701 --> 00:15.000
I don't want to.

00:15.301 --> 00:17.500
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.

00:19.401 --> 00:20.467
You're back!

00:20.467 --> 00:21.767
Do I know you?

00:21.767 --> 00:23.501
I see the same guy that you see,

00:23.502 --> 00:26.135
Different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.

00:26.202 --> 00:27.801
He's in there somewhere.

00:27.868 --> 00:28.801
He just has to be.

00:28.801 --> 00:29.801
You're not gonna tell me that

00:29.801 --> 00:31.101
you think I'm your husband reincarnated.

00:31.168 --> 00:34.035
Because your are the only sane person I've met since I woke up.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.701
It's not much. But maybe you could help me finish my garage.

00:36.768 --> 00:38.202
And you could live there while you do the work.

00:38.268 --> 00:40.035
Just until you figure out your next move.

00:40.101 --> 00:42.035
That's strange. I've been hoping for a clue.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.801
Something to tell me who I was.

00:43.868 --> 00:45.569
I bought that less than a month ago.

00:45.635 --> 00:48.368
Question is, who did I buy it for?

00:48.435 --> 00:49.801
Sam?

00:49.801 --> 00:52.302
Oh, my god. It's true. You don't know who I am, do you?

00:52.368 --> 00:53.535
You must be Nicole.

00:53.602 --> 00:54.301
The fiance?

00:54.301 --> 00:56.802
She is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.535
Ok. So where are they now?

01:02.602 --> 01:04.168
I don't know. He hasn't been home all day.

01:04.235 --> 01:06.635
But he's with her? Nikki.

01:06.701 --> 01:07.834
I assume so.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.135
How much time are they actually spending together?

01:10.202 --> 01:13.135
Well, he's not working, and she's in town. so...

01:13.202 --> 01:15.435
You didn't tell me they were spending whole days together.

01:15.502 --> 01:18.168
What about the nights? Is she still staying at the hotel?

01:18.235 --> 01:19.268
Yes.

01:19.335 --> 01:22.468
But they're spending all day together.

01:22.535 --> 01:24.768
I'm really trying not to think about it.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.669
I thought he was just trying to get in touch with her

01:26.734 --> 01:28.251
So that he could explain to her what happened

01:28.251 --> 01:29.768
and then say goodbye.

01:29.834 --> 01:32.035
Well, guess what. They're saying hello.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.268
I think I hear them.

01:35.335 --> 01:38.935
No. No. No. They're just gonna see you.

01:39.001 --> 01:40.768
Oh, yeah. That's a lot better.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.701
Did she see me?

01:42.768 --> 01:43.701
Can I?

01:43.768 --> 01:45.535
- No. - Hold on a second, Sam.

01:45.602 --> 01:47.768
Uh, Melinda?

01:47.834 --> 01:48.935
This is nuts.

01:49.001 --> 01:50.302
Hi. I am Delia.

01:50.368 --> 01:51.602
Hi, Delia. I'm Nikki.

01:51.669 --> 01:53.901
I was looking for Melinda.

01:53.968 --> 01:55.801
- Found it!  -Oh, gosh!

01:58.801 --> 02:02.168
Nikki, Delia. Have you met Delia?

02:02.235 --> 02:03.801
Yes. We did.

02:03.868 --> 02:05.301
- I found it.  - Oh, great.

02:05.301 --> 02:07.468
I'm so sorry we had to come all the way back here for just this.

02:07.535 --> 02:09.768
No. It's great.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.435
Hey, Melinda.

02:11.502 --> 02:14.502
Hi, Sam.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.301
Uh, Nikki left her cell phone here. So...

02:16.301 --> 02:18.468
Right. So...

02:18.535 --> 02:19.868
I guess I'll be taking you back...

02:19.935 --> 02:21.569
Well, actually that's why I wanted talk to you.

02:21.635 --> 02:24.268
Melinda, the hotel that I booked is really nice.

02:24.335 --> 02:25.402
It's fine and everything.

02:25.468 --> 02:27.168
But I'm actually going to be spending

02:27.235 --> 02:29.834
a little bit more time than I originally planned.

02:29.991 --> 02:32.659
And I really want to help Sam out as much as possible.

02:32.725 --> 02:35.125
But I was only able to get a week off from work.

02:35.191 --> 02:37.991
And I don't want to waste a minute that I could spend with him.

02:38.058 --> 02:41.592
So, you are here. And just if you didn't mind?

02:41.659 --> 02:43.158
Mind?

02:43.225 --> 02:46.458
Just 'cause obviously I couldn't stay with Sam.

02:46.525 --> 02:47.924
Obviously.

02:47.991 --> 02:49.791
No. No.

02:49.858 --> 02:51.592
Because we're really just getting to know each other.

02:51.659 --> 02:54.791
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

02:54.858 --> 02:58.058
Really? It's ok. I can stay with you?

02:59.025 --> 02:59.958
Sure.

03:00.025 --> 03:01.500
- Great.  - Great.

03:01.958 --> 03:02.992
Great.

03:05.824 --> 03:07.758
We were walking around the house into the back.

03:07.758 --> 03:09.692
And we get there.

03:09.759 --> 03:12.392
And her grandmother and grandfather are there.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.325
Oh, my god!

03:18.458 --> 03:19.759
What are you doing?

03:19.824 --> 03:21.058
Swimming.

03:21.325 --> 03:23.158
Are you crazy? What are you thinking?

03:23.325 --> 03:25.025
Paula, come on, it's freezing!

03:25.092 --> 03:26.698
No way!

03:26.698 --> 03:28.125
She's going in.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.525
- No.  - Catch me if you can!

03:29.591 --> 03:30.891
Paula, don't go out there.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.425
Oh, my God! This is no£¡

03:33.858 --> 03:34.991
Is she serious?

03:34.991 --> 03:36.191
I'm not going in there, no way!

03:36.191 --> 03:37.191
Paula, come back!

03:37.191 --> 03:38.191
Mark, do something.

03:38.191 --> 03:40.875
Paula, come on! Wait!

03:40.875 --> 03:43.559
Paula, come on! It's freezing.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.559
Seriously, come on!

03:56.658 --> 03:58.425
Paula, come on, it's freezing.

03:58.492 --> 04:00.492
Where is she?

04:00.559 --> 04:02.525
Mark, look down.

04:04.691 --> 04:07.325
- Fish, oh, gross. - Oh, sick.

04:07.392 --> 04:09.258
Paula, come back, ok?

04:09.325 --> 04:12.092
Very funny, we get it. Just come back, seriously.

04:12.158 --> 04:13.125
Come on.

04:14.624 --> 04:16.190
Come on, guys. The water's great.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.192
- Come on, Paula. - All right, let's go.

04:21.257 --> 04:22.758
Paula, come back.

04:22.825 --> 04:24.658
Yeah, Paula. It's not funny. Seriously.

04:28.125 --> 04:29.225
What was that?

04:29.292 --> 04:31.591
Oh, my god. I think there's...

04:33.991 --> 04:35.691
Paula, look, I'm worried! Paula! Hold that.

04:35.758 --> 04:37.791
She's not kidding, get her out of there!

04:37.858 --> 04:39.425
Oh, my god, what's going on?

04:39.492 --> 04:41.158
Get her out of there!

04:41.225 --> 04:42.724
Oh, my god!

04:42.791 --> 04:44.225
I think something's in there! What is that?!

04:44.292 --> 04:46.658
What's the matter?! Hurry! Oh, my god!

04:46.724 --> 04:48.125
Swim this way, come on! Mark, get her!

04:52.891 --> 04:55.858
Oh, my god.

04:55.925 --> 04:57.791
Hurry, hurry, get out! What the hell was that?

04:59.225 --> 05:01.025
- Here, give me your coat. - Here, put this on.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.825
Hey, it's ok. You're ok now.

05:05.058 --> 05:06.958
Just get me out of here.

05:12.092 --> 05:15.925
Ok, I enjoy hiking like the next girl but why are we out here?

05:15.991 --> 05:17.617
Getting your mind off the fact

05:17.618 --> 05:18.973
that your husband's dating your roomie.

05:19.092 --> 05:20.991
She is not my roomie. Ok?

05:21.058 --> 05:23.158
I was in such a fog, I didn't know what I said yes to.

05:23.225 --> 05:25.092
You're literally the girl that can't say no.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.025
Should've made you very popular in high school.

05:27.092 --> 05:28.392
Hey! I can say "no."

05:28.459 --> 05:29.591
Then what are you doing up here with me?

05:29.658 --> 05:31.459
You said you needed a favor.

05:31.525 --> 05:33.225
And I need a favor, too. Ok?

05:33.292 --> 05:35.724
Just please keep working with Sam...

05:35.791 --> 05:37.591
No matter what it takes to get his memory back...

05:37.658 --> 05:40.591
before Nikki convinces him that he loves her.

05:40.658 --> 05:42.624
Just please help us.

05:42.691 --> 05:45.492
Of course. I'll do whatever I can.

05:45.559 --> 05:48.358
But now my favor.

05:48.425 --> 05:51.025
Ew. Do you smell that?

05:51.092 --> 05:53.691
Dead fish everywhere.

05:56.158 --> 05:59.392
A biologist at the university's doing some tests in the water.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.492
But I thought you might get results faster.

06:01.559 --> 06:02.160
Me?

06:02.706 --> 06:04.273
A student of mine was up here swimming

06:04.274 --> 06:05.274
with some friends last night.

06:05.925 --> 06:08.158
The whole experience freaked her out.

06:08.225 --> 06:10.525
And not just the dead fish.

06:10.591 --> 06:13.125
She said something was pulling her under.

06:13.192 --> 06:15.292
She called it a presence.

06:18.459 --> 06:19.858
Look, I know it's a long shot,

06:19.925 --> 06:22.624
but her father died earlier this year...

06:25.325 --> 06:27.225
What was his name?

06:27.292 --> 06:28.459
Edwin Hathaway.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.358
He's here.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.225
But do you hear that?

06:37.125 --> 06:39.225
He's not alone.

06:46.292 --> 06:49.225
Tell no one.

07:23.925 --> 07:25.191
You're sure that's the ghost you saw?

07:25.358 --> 07:26.991
I think so. He responded to his name, anyway.

07:27.058 --> 07:29.293
According to his obituary, he was 52.

07:29.294 --> 07:30.292
Died of a stroke.

07:30.358 --> 07:33.025
Well ,that's weird. 'cause ghosts usually appear one of two ways.

07:33.192 --> 07:34.491
How they looked at the moment of their death,

07:34.558 --> 07:35.592
or how they looked in life.

07:35.658 --> 07:37.591
Half these ghosts were rotting and decomposing.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.358
It says here he died at the hospital.

07:40.425 --> 07:41.758
What was he even doing at the lake?

07:41.825 --> 07:43.958
Sometimes spirits gather. I've seen it before.

07:44.025 --> 07:46.425
But it's usually around the place of their death.

07:46.492 --> 07:48.392
So this is where they all died?

07:48.459 --> 07:51.158
You'd think, but I couldn't find any mass deaths in the vicinity.

07:51.225 --> 07:54.325
Do you remember the plane crash a few years ago?

07:54.392 --> 07:57.258
Yeah. But that was almost 20 miles away.

07:57.325 --> 08:00.216
So what are they doing there?

08:00.217 --> 08:02.025
Keeping a big fat secret. "Tell no one."

08:02.092 --> 08:03.624
Not a lot of subtext there.

08:03.892 --> 08:06.392
Unfortunately, our instructions came a little bit late.

08:06.459 --> 08:09.658
It's the biologist I told you about from the university.

08:09.724 --> 08:12.039
He found heavy concentrations

08:12.040 --> 08:13.057
of a particular pathogen in the water.

08:13.058 --> 08:15.258
The same pathogen found in the waters

08:15.325 --> 08:16.624
filled with bodies after hurricane Katrina.

08:16.691 --> 08:18.425
So they're actually in there?

08:18.492 --> 08:19.420
We'll know soon enough.

08:19.421 --> 08:20.231
Health department's gonna dredge the lake.

08:21.425 --> 08:24.025
Oh! That's my appointment with Sam.

08:24.092 --> 08:26.325
Well, go! Go. Get out of here.

08:30.091 --> 08:30.624
What?

08:30.691 --> 08:32.624
No, but I want it back. Give it back!

08:32.691 --> 08:33.991
You gave it to me.

08:34.058 --> 08:35.258
I did not give it to you.

08:35.424 --> 08:37.724
Give it.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.691
Well, here look. If you want it so badly.

08:41.758 --> 08:42.758
Well, I just wanted to show you the article.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.758
You always do this.

08:48.091 --> 08:49.025
Hey, Eli.

08:49.091 --> 08:50.292
Hey.

08:50.358 --> 08:51.225
This is Nikki.

08:51.292 --> 08:52.692
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

08:52.759 --> 08:55.625
Nice to meet you, too.

08:55.692 --> 08:58.158
Ok. Buddy. Take care.

09:00.025 --> 09:02.325
Well, listen. Thank you so much for helping us out.

09:02.392 --> 09:03.958
Oh, sure. Um...

09:04.125 --> 09:06.158
Is this going to be a joint session?

09:06.225 --> 09:08.692
No, it's just me. But we were running so late,

09:08.759 --> 09:10.091
I didn't have a chance to take Nikki back...

09:10.158 --> 09:11.358
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Not a problem.

09:11.624 --> 09:14.759
I'll just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.658
Thank you.

09:20.225 --> 09:23.425
Past-life regression is just a kind of hypno-therapy.

09:23.492 --> 09:24.924
With all due respect,

09:24.991 --> 09:28.158
I just don't get how discovering that I had a past life

09:28.225 --> 09:29.891
Is going to help me find this one.

09:29.958 --> 09:31.759
All right. The one that I lost.

09:31.825 --> 09:35.392
It loosens the subconscious.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.291
My subconscious?

09:38.792 --> 09:40.759
Do you want to know what my subconscious is telling me?

09:40.825 --> 09:44.058
It is telling me that something off.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.792
Good, that's good. Keep going.

09:46.859 --> 09:48.492
Well, Nikki for example. Ok?

09:48.558 --> 09:51.592
She's beautiful. She's smart. She's blonde?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.692
Blonde? You're into blondes?

09:53.759 --> 09:55.392
No. That she has nice hair.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.958
I remembered how it felt when I put my arm around her.

09:59.024 --> 10:00.658
I mean, I remember how it smelled.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.395
Well, then why can't I remember at all

10:03.396 --> 10:05.312
jerking her around for 10 years?

10:05.492 --> 10:06.858
Maybe you just didn't want to marry her.

10:06.925 --> 10:08.659
Ok. So I was Mr. Can't Commit.

10:08.724 --> 10:10.325
That's what everyone says.

10:10.392 --> 10:16.025
You know what I think? I think I remember wanting to get married.

10:16.091 --> 10:19.991
I feel like that I had finally met the right person and then...

10:20.058 --> 10:21.824
Tell me about her.

10:21.891 --> 10:25.358
Well, that we wanted to have kids.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.691
I mean, maybe we were even trying.

10:29.158 --> 10:31.059
If that's true, then why isn't she telling me about that?

10:31.065 --> 10:32.099
By she you mean...?

10:32.164 --> 10:33.698
Nikki. Who else?

10:33.765 --> 10:35.099
You tell me.

10:35.164 --> 10:38.565
Nikki can't be the only person you dated.

10:38.632 --> 10:43.365
I want you to consider that maybe...just maybe...

10:43.431 --> 10:45.498
There's someone else.

10:45.565 --> 10:47.865
Wait, someone more important

10:47.932 --> 10:50.632
than the woman I spent half my adult life with?

10:54.598 --> 10:56.531
Look, I just think that's kinda hard to imagine.

10:56.598 --> 10:59.065
Look, I...I really gotta talk to her.

11:00.298 --> 11:03.065
But thanks. This has been a big help.

11:44.798 --> 11:45.898
Did they find anything?

11:45.965 --> 11:47.231
Yeah. Plenty.

11:47.298 --> 11:50.065
A reporter said that it's 8 victims and counting.

11:50.131 --> 11:51.732
Victims? Is that what they are?

11:51.798 --> 11:53.531
Paula's father died in a hospital.

11:53.598 --> 11:55.398
Yeah, well that's what his obit said.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.099
Maybe the paper got it wrong.

11:57.164 --> 11:59.065
Anyway, it looks like they're going to be out here a while.

11:59.131 --> 12:01.365
I don't hear anything.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.798
They're here.

12:06.195 --> 12:08.295
- So how'd it go with Sam? - So-so.

12:08.301 --> 12:10.596
As his shrink there's only so much I can tell you was.

12:10.596 --> 12:11.700
what I almost told him.

12:11.767 --> 12:12.734
Which was?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.201
That he's Jim, your husband.

12:14.268 --> 12:17.201
And anything he remembers about anyone he loved is you.

12:17.268 --> 12:18.400
So he remembered something?

12:18.467 --> 12:19.700
Just that he wanted to have kids.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.134
Well, that's huge!

12:21.201 --> 12:23.301
He thinks he wants to have them with her.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.400
What am I going to do?

12:25.467 --> 12:28.667
You've disturbed us. All of us.

12:28.734 --> 12:30.834
All we asked for was your silence.

12:30.901 --> 12:32.467
I couldn't stop this if I wanted to.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.334
It's the health department and the police.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.667
They want answers.

12:35.734 --> 12:38.334
Edwin, we know you have a family that cared about you.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.433
They deserve to find out what happened to you.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.067
Just tell us how we can help.

12:43.134 --> 12:44.767
What is it that you want...

12:44.834 --> 12:46.634
To protect the living.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.800
From what?

12:49.300 --> 12:50.300
Got another one.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.634
What if they just all died of the same thing?

12:55.700 --> 12:58.167
Some chemical, toxic-something?

12:58.174 --> 12:59.367
In the lake?

12:59.434 --> 13:00.850
I think the C.D.C. would say that

13:00.850 --> 13:02.267
the dead people are the problem.

13:02.334 --> 13:04.434
And bothers me is not how they got there,

13:04.434 --> 13:06.534
but why they stayed.

13:06.534 --> 13:08.367
- Your Latte, and the cappuccino. - Thanks.

13:08.434 --> 13:12.067
Well, they were just hanging around their bodies, right?

13:12.134 --> 13:13.167
Yeah. That's the upside.

13:13.234 --> 13:14.733
That's an upside?

13:14.800 --> 13:17.601
You know, it just means as spirits they weren't lured

13:17.668 --> 13:19.067
there by someone or something.

13:19.134 --> 13:22.700
What do you mean? Like some kinda ghost cult?

13:22.767 --> 13:25.217
No. More like the ghosts in the tunnels,

13:25.217 --> 13:27.668
you know, or the watchers.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.334
The watchers?

13:29.401 --> 13:32.867
A group of spirits who made all the threats about Jim.

13:32.934 --> 13:37.167
They said that there would be a price to pay for what I can do.

13:37.234 --> 13:40.301
Ahh. There's Sam.

13:40.367 --> 13:42.934
And no Nikki. And he's heading toward the store.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.467
Go. Go be with him.

13:44.534 --> 13:47.568
I don't know if I'm up for being his "good friend" right now.

13:47.634 --> 13:48.934
Go!

13:49.000 --> 13:51.401
All right. Ok.

13:54.634 --> 13:55.634
Sam.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.301
Hey, Melinda. That's funny.

13:57.367 --> 13:58.934
I was just coming to see you.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.501
Do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit?

14:01.567 --> 14:03.100
- No. I'm good.  - Great.

14:04.367 --> 14:07.967
Thanks for, you know, letting Nikki stay with you.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.501
Oh, yeah. It's no problem.

14:09.567 --> 14:11.033
I didn't even see her last night.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.267
Yeah, she said you were still asleep when she came in.

14:13.334 --> 14:15.434
And she was asleep when I left. So.

14:17.933 --> 14:20.067
Yeah. She's a night person.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.534
I mean, at least that's what she tells me.

14:22.601 --> 14:23.968
I guess both of us were.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.133
She'd do crosswords. I would read the sports pages.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.601
We'd stay up... I hate crosswords.

14:29.667 --> 14:30.968
I don't even remember.

14:31.033 --> 14:32.467
Although, you know it's funny.

14:32.534 --> 14:35.701
I do remember Ryan Howard's 2006 batting average...

14:35.767 --> 14:37.033
3-13

14:38.901 --> 14:40.701
Wait. How do you know that?

14:40.767 --> 14:43.901
You hear something enough times it kinda sticks.

14:47.434 --> 14:50.734
Look, Melinda, what I wanted to ask you is,

14:50.801 --> 14:54.200
How is it I remember something as stupid as sports trivia

14:54.267 --> 14:56.400
But I don't remember something that

14:56.400 --> 14:58.534
Nikki and I fought about for years?

15:00.634 --> 15:04.934
In my head, I remember wanting to have kids.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.934
And Nikki didn't?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.734
No, she says she did.

15:08.801 --> 15:12.300
So this big memory breakthrough I'm having is wrong.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.968
And she's gotta be right.

15:15.033 --> 15:16.100
I mean, she sounds right.

15:16.167 --> 15:19.167
I'm being the typical guy, dragging my heels.

15:19.234 --> 15:21.834
Not all guys are like that.

15:21.901 --> 15:23.767
My husband wasn't.

15:23.834 --> 15:26.367
I was always the one dragging my heels.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.567
But Jim, he...

15:30.000 --> 15:32.767
He wanted everything that you're remembering...

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
which has to mean something, right?

15:37.801 --> 15:39.367
What to me and Nikki?

15:39.434 --> 15:41.100
No, to you.

15:42.534 --> 15:44.534
It's none of my business.

15:44.601 --> 15:48.017
But maybe you...maybe you shouldn't

15:48.017 --> 15:51.434
listen to what everyone else says,

15:51.501 --> 15:53.334
not about the stuff that really matters.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.701
You know who you are.

15:55.767 --> 16:00.000
When you start believing that, you'll get back to you, to...

16:00.067 --> 16:02.701
To what? To being the guy like your husband?

16:02.767 --> 16:05.667
Committed, confident enough in himself,

16:05.734 --> 16:10.000
In the world, to bring another human being into it?

16:10.067 --> 16:12.717
But you see, I wasn't.

16:12.717 --> 16:15.367
So pretending that I was is just wishful thinking.

16:22.734 --> 16:24.434
Thank you so much for coming.

16:24.501 --> 16:25.834
Of course, you seemed upset.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.234
I don't understand.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.133
I tell you something weird happened at the lake,

16:29.200 --> 16:30.450
And then the next thing I know I get

16:30.450 --> 16:31.701
a call from the health department

16:31.767 --> 16:34.501
recommending that I should go on a course of antibiotics.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.200
And then I turn on the TV

16:36.267 --> 16:37.250
and see them pulling dead bodies out

16:37.250 --> 16:39.834
of water that I was just swimming in.

16:39.901 --> 16:41.601
I know this must be scary...

16:41.667 --> 16:43.167
It's disgusting.

16:43.234 --> 16:44.701
I wish I could make you feel better.

16:44.767 --> 16:47.701
But unfortunately, I think I'm about to make you feel worse.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.267
What are you talking about?

16:49.334 --> 16:52.000
I need to ask you about your father.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.367
First I need you to consider the possibility

16:54.434 --> 16:58.734
that parts of us may exist after our bodies have stopped.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.200
Why?

17:00.267 --> 17:02.801
Because I've talked to your father's ghost.

17:02.868 --> 17:04.166
He was up at the lake.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.300
He's there...

17:05.367 --> 17:08.000
No, this is...this is crazy.

17:08.067 --> 17:10.233
Paula, you said you felt a presence,

17:10.300 --> 17:12.467
You think my dad is one of the corpses

17:12.534 --> 17:14.067
They're pulling out of that water?

17:14.133 --> 17:15.300
Look, I know this is hard to accept...

17:15.367 --> 17:17.300
No, literally. There's no way.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.968
Why?

17:20.567 --> 17:22.767
He's right here.

17:25.567 --> 17:28.534
Your father was cremated...where?

19:08.501 --> 19:12.167
Is this what you wanted? To be cremated?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.601
I was done with my body.

19:14.667 --> 19:18.834
I wanted my family to be done with it, too.

19:18.901 --> 19:23.234
I thought, somehow, it would be easier for them.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.834
And now they have to feel your loss all over again.

19:25.901 --> 19:27.467
"Protect the living."

19:27.534 --> 19:30.234
You meant, from what happened to you.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.167
We were betrayed.

19:32.234 --> 19:34.868
Look what's become of us.

19:34.934 --> 19:36.334
It's just how you see yourselves.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.400
No. It's how they'll see us too.

19:39.467 --> 19:42.534
My wife, my daughter.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.601
They'll be forced to...

19:45.601 --> 19:47.733
No. No. You can talk to them.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.534
You can help them through this.

19:49.601 --> 19:52.067
And they'll remember you just as you were.

19:52.134 --> 19:53.733
And then you can move on.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.967
We're not going anywhere.

19:56.034 --> 19:57.733
We've waited.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.434
There's business to finish.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.800
What is it that you want to finish?

20:07.833 --> 20:10.234
You mean who.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.733
If they went to the movies they should been back by now.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.166
Or if they went to dinner...

20:20.433 --> 20:21.733
I don't know where they are.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.466
And I don't want to know.

20:23.533 --> 20:25.199
Well, you should want to know

20:25.266 --> 20:27.499
When your competition looks like this.

20:28.566 --> 20:31.033
It's tough love, girlfriend. And you gotta hear this.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.132
Ok. So what do you want me to do?

20:32.199 --> 20:33.433
Get into the game!

20:33.499 --> 20:35.566
You gotta fight fire with fire!

20:35.633 --> 20:37.283
Look, it's not like I can throw on a bikini

20:37.283 --> 20:38.933
and mud wrestle for the guy.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Well, you can't just sit around and do nothing.

20:41.067 --> 20:42.166
Does it look like I'm doing nothing?

20:42.232 --> 20:44.366
No, it looks like you're helping another ghost.

20:44.433 --> 20:46.433
Not just one ghost, a lot of them.

20:46.499 --> 20:48.166
Ok, and they left loved ones behind.

20:48.232 --> 20:50.366
And if I don't figure out who dumped their bodies...

20:50.433 --> 20:52.566
I am not suggesting that this work isn't important.

20:52.633 --> 20:56.333
I'm just saying that ghosts can keep.

20:56.399 --> 20:58.733
I'm not so sure Sam can.

21:00.299 --> 21:02.466
Yeah. Neither am I.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.733
Then why don't you do something about it?

21:04.800 --> 21:06.166
Because nothing...

21:06.232 --> 21:10.132
Nothing I can do will get him to remember me...

21:10.199 --> 21:12.433
Or choose me.

21:12.499 --> 21:15.232
All I can do is have faith.

21:15.299 --> 21:16.766
That's all I have right now.

21:16.833 --> 21:20.466
Faith.

21:20.533 --> 21:22.683
It's so nice to meet you.

21:22.683 --> 21:24.833
Carl gets so few visitors lately.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.700
Not that we're surprised in his business.

21:27.766 --> 21:30.000
Who wants to watch someone dying?

21:30.067 --> 21:32.566
When did he close the funeral home?

21:34.067 --> 21:38.366
When the cancer made it impossible for him to work.

21:38.433 --> 21:41.666
Did he take care of your family?

21:41.733 --> 21:45.633
No. He...helped some friends of mine.

21:47.199 --> 21:51.533
I keep wishing someone close might get through to him.

21:51.600 --> 21:55.633
He doesn't listen to me anymore.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.333
Get through to him?

21:58.499 --> 22:03.967
He has so little time, and he's in such pain...

22:04.033 --> 22:07.132
But he won't take the pills they give him.

22:09.333 --> 22:13.800
I guess he's afraid it'll make the end come sooner.

22:13.866 --> 22:17.266
But really, why go on like this?

22:18.199 --> 22:19.800
Do you want me to talk to him?

22:21.499 --> 22:23.466
Thank you.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.232
Come on.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.266
Carl?

22:49.333 --> 22:51.333
My name is Melinda Gordon.

22:51.399 --> 22:52.933
I don't know you.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.600
What do you want?

22:55.666 --> 22:58.466
I came to talk about the lake.

22:58.533 --> 23:00.299
What lake?

23:00.366 --> 23:02.900
Where the bodies are.

23:03.833 --> 23:06.433
Where you put them. Didn't you?

23:10.933 --> 23:14.399
Part of me hoped I would die before this day.

23:14.466 --> 23:16.000
And the other part?

23:16.067 --> 23:17.900
What if they're waiting for me?

23:20.700 --> 23:21.700
Why did you do it?

23:21.766 --> 23:23.900
I thought I had no choice.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.533
What do you mean?

23:25.600 --> 23:29.533
The big mortuary chains kept calling to get me to sell.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.433
But my great grandfather built that place from nothing.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.299
And I was proud.

23:35.366 --> 23:37.800
And I wanted a better price.

23:37.866 --> 23:39.766
What happened?

23:39.833 --> 23:41.299
What always happens.

23:41.366 --> 23:45.499
They undercut me. I couldn't compete. The money ran out.

23:45.566 --> 23:50.466
And when the furnace finally broke down,

23:50.533 --> 23:52.833
I was desperate.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.000
It's no excuse.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.266
Sometimes I think...

23:58.333 --> 24:02.067
The cancer is a punishment.

24:02.132 --> 24:04.600
All this pain.

24:06.499 --> 24:09.132
Your wife said there's pain medication that you won't take.

24:09.199 --> 24:11.866
I feel evil.

24:11.933 --> 24:15.433
Carl, you made a mistake. You're not evil.

24:15.499 --> 24:18.633
No. No. I feel evil around me.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.299
Everywhere.

24:24.766 --> 24:28.366
You're right. Carl, they're here.

24:28.433 --> 24:32.299
All the ghosts of the bodies that you threw into that lake.

24:32.366 --> 24:34.833
Oh, no.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.967
I see them.

24:37.033 --> 24:39.766
Oh, please.

24:39.833 --> 24:43.466
They're angry because of what you did. But I can help.

24:43.533 --> 24:44.904
Please just give me the names of all

24:44.904 --> 24:46.466
the people that you threw into the lake.

24:46.533 --> 24:49.033
I can talk to their families. I can help them heal.

24:49.099 --> 24:51.132
To help them suffer, you mean.

24:51.199 --> 24:54.067
Then they'll drop their anger, ok?

24:54.132 --> 24:56.533
Not until he's suffered like we have.

24:58.666 --> 24:59.933
You need to go into the light.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.600
There's forgiveness there.

25:06.466 --> 25:10.433
Carl, take your medicine.

25:20.166 --> 25:22.299
I went back and looked where he told me to.

25:22.366 --> 25:23.700
Back to the funeral home?

25:23.766 --> 25:25.666
Wow, you're a glutton for gruesome.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.967
Yeah well with Mary sunshine bunking at my house,

25:28.033 --> 25:29.466
I already feel like formaldehyde girl.

25:29.533 --> 25:33.166
Formaldehyde girl, that's funny.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.800
Sorry. Not funny.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.433
Did you get the list of names?

25:38.499 --> 25:40.233
Yeah. I'm just trying to see

25:40.233 --> 25:41.967
if their I.D.s match what we found.

25:42.033 --> 25:43.633
Hey, here's Paula's dad.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.733
Was everybody on the list scheduled for cremation?

25:45.800 --> 25:48.232
Cremation, cremation.

25:48.299 --> 25:49.700
Yeah, it looks like they were meant to be...

25:51.067 --> 25:53.166
Cremated. I'll call you back.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.700
How are you?

25:57.766 --> 25:59.266
I'm fine.

26:01.232 --> 26:04.533
Um, do you have a minute to talk about Sam?

26:04.600 --> 26:06.766
Sure. What about him?

26:06.833 --> 26:08.733
Well, first of all, I want to apologize

26:08.800 --> 26:11.166
for imposing on you at your house and here at work now.

26:11.232 --> 26:17.199
But I really...honestly, I didn't know who else to go to.

26:20.366 --> 26:22.199
You know how you grow up imagining

26:22.199 --> 26:24.033
what it'll be like to be in love?

26:24.099 --> 26:26.666
You picture your boyfriend, your husband.

26:26.733 --> 26:27.933
And not just the good times...

26:28.000 --> 26:29.866
But the fights and the problems, too.

26:29.933 --> 26:31.266
Yeah. Sure.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.599
Could you ever have imagined

26:32.599 --> 26:33.866
something like this happening?

26:33.933 --> 26:37.399
A guy that you loved just wakes up one day

26:37.466 --> 26:39.866
and then suddenly has no idea who you are?

26:41.232 --> 26:44.232
No. Never.

26:44.299 --> 26:46.067
Really? Not at all?

26:49.199 --> 26:53.766
I...I don't understand.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.967
I guess I was so blown away by what happened to Sam

26:59.033 --> 27:02.000
that I really didn't notice it at first, but, uh...

27:02.067 --> 27:04.333
Do you think it's a little odd

27:04.399 --> 27:05.900
that he's staying in your garage?

27:05.967 --> 27:09.967
The same garage he was supposed to be doing designs for?

27:10.033 --> 27:12.266
And where are the plans? I haven't seen any of those.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.199
What are you driving at?

27:14.266 --> 27:16.833
When I first came here,

27:16.900 --> 27:19.600
my idea was a quick in and out.

27:19.666 --> 27:21.566
Let Sam know that he was forgiven,

27:21.633 --> 27:24.333
maybe fill in a few memory blanks, and then say goodbye.

27:24.399 --> 27:27.399
But now that I've seen who he is,

27:27.466 --> 27:31.266
this new Sam who wants kids,

27:31.333 --> 27:33.766
who's ready to settle down.

27:33.833 --> 27:38.566
I...I don't want to let him go.

27:42.433 --> 27:44.600
What does that have to do with me?

27:46.266 --> 27:48.700
That's what I'm trying to find out.

27:53.733 --> 27:56.433
Shouldn't you be asking Sam?

28:01.232 --> 28:03.533
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?

28:03.600 --> 28:06.466
I thought I just did.

28:18.599 --> 28:20.433
Thank you.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.866
Mrs. Sessick, you startled me.

28:36.933 --> 28:39.132
I apologize for coming by without calling.

28:39.199 --> 28:41.800
I thought you'd want to know.

28:41.866 --> 28:43.733
Carl died, a few hours ago.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.000
I'm so sorry.

28:46.067 --> 28:48.199
I don't know what you said,

28:48.266 --> 28:51.333
but after you left, he seemed to change.

28:51.399 --> 28:55.466
He relaxed, and decided to take his pain medicine.

28:58.299 --> 28:59.866
After a few hours later,

28:59.933 --> 29:02.132
he took my hand.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.733
Then his eyes opened wide,

29:05.800 --> 29:08.967
like he saw something amazing.

29:09.033 --> 29:10.833
And that was it.

29:13.067 --> 29:16.333
That look in his eyes,

29:16.399 --> 29:20.433
he must have just seen the face of his maker.

29:20.499 --> 29:22.766
Don't you think?

29:24.833 --> 29:27.700
That's a lovely notion.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.433
Thank you so much, Melinda,

29:31.499 --> 29:34.600
for giving my husband peace.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.633
Melinda?

29:40.700 --> 29:42.266
Melinda!

29:43.800 --> 29:45.266
How did I get here?

29:45.333 --> 29:48.633
Oh, no! No. Melinda!

29:49.700 --> 29:51.099
Melinda!

29:51.166 --> 29:52.600
Melinda!

29:52.666 --> 29:56.766
Oh, please god, anywhere but here.

29:56.833 --> 30:00.566
For you, there's nowhere but here.

30:02.399 --> 30:03.900
Forgive me.

30:03.967 --> 30:05.633
Please, I'm begging you.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.132
I'm begging you for forgiveness.

30:08.199 --> 30:10.466
Please! Please!

30:10.533 --> 30:13.266
That's not what you'll find here.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.967
Melinda!

30:18.033 --> 30:19.499
Help me!

30:20.300 --> 30:22.599
Tell me, how can I help you?

30:24.000 --> 30:27.200
Mom, you wanted to talk about this.

30:28.267 --> 30:30.833
No one is mad at you, Mom.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.966
Speak for yourself.

30:37.701 --> 30:40.133
When Edwin had his stroke,

30:40.200 --> 30:42.400
he was jogging a few miles from home.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.467
He had no wallet, no ID.

30:45.067 --> 30:48.100
So the hospital needed someone to say that it was him.

30:48.167 --> 30:49.833
I went.

30:49.900 --> 30:52.434
But I couldn't do it.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.267
I just...I couldn't look at him.

30:55.334 --> 30:58.367
Paula was there by then, so she did it.

30:59.734 --> 31:02.467
I made my own daughter go in and look at her dead father.

31:02.534 --> 31:04.500
Mom, I didn't mind doing it.

31:04.567 --> 31:06.866
There was no shame in what happened to him.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.366
Why couldn't I just look at him?

31:08.433 --> 31:11.866
Marlene, there's no shame in what you did, either.

31:11.933 --> 31:16.966
Most people never see their deceased loved ones ever.

31:17.033 --> 31:22.000
My daughter, she said that you knew something about Edwin's spirit.

31:22.100 --> 31:25.400
He is stuck here? He can't move on?

31:25.467 --> 31:26.833
That's right.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.966
He and the others spirits whose bodies were put in the lake,

31:29.033 --> 31:31.400
They're earthbound,

31:31.467 --> 31:34.133
which means they haven't been able to cross over into the light.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.400
Why not?

31:35.467 --> 31:37.133
They don't want you to know what happened to them.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.067
Out of shame.

31:39.133 --> 31:42.667
That's why your husband tried to scare Paula away

31:42.734 --> 31:44.534
- that night at the lake. - Can we help them?

31:44.600 --> 31:45.933
You might.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.767
But right now, they're very angry.

31:48.133 --> 31:50.766
Until the right moment comes...

31:50.783 --> 31:53.033
If Edwin's ghost is still here,

31:53.100 --> 31:55.634
then that means he saw what I did when he died.

31:55.701 --> 31:59.833
Please give me the chance to make it right.

32:17.334 --> 32:21.100
Sam, please don't sneak up on me like that!

32:21.167 --> 32:22.567
Sorry.

32:24.633 --> 32:28.501
I'm sorry. The door was open.

32:28.567 --> 32:31.000
Look, I took Nikki to a hotel last night.

32:31.067 --> 32:34.100
And, um, I just wanted to come by and see if you were ok.

32:34.167 --> 32:35.367
I'm fine.

32:35.434 --> 32:37.033
Are you sure? Because you seemed a little tense,

32:37.100 --> 32:38.666
and frankly, so did Nikki.

32:38.733 --> 32:40.501
No, really. I'm fine.

32:41.467 --> 32:42.933
Ok.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.467
Well, then I'll go back to the hotel.

32:45.533 --> 32:47.633
Why?

32:47.700 --> 32:50.867
I mean, she's been here almost a week,

32:50.933 --> 32:54.367
so what are you going to do?

32:54.434 --> 32:56.833
I don't know. It's weird.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.967
I feel things when I'm with her.

32:59.034 --> 33:00.533
Nice things.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.900
Her smell is familiar.

33:02.967 --> 33:05.200
I recognize the feel of her hand when I hold it.

33:05.267 --> 33:09.900
You know, it's comfortable.

33:09.967 --> 33:12.234
Ok.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.967
Melinda,not everybody can have what you had with your husband.

33:16.034 --> 33:17.666
All right? And given my track record,

33:17.733 --> 33:19.401
I'm not sure I'd even be capable of that.

33:19.467 --> 33:20.700
Of course you are.

33:20.767 --> 33:23.800
Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.

33:23.867 --> 33:26.267
And, look, if suddenly I feel like I should take a chance,

33:26.334 --> 33:28.633
you know, get some feelings back, maybe that's progress.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.566
Maybe that's a good thing.

33:30.633 --> 33:33.401
Maybe I should reach out with both hands.

33:35.833 --> 33:37.700
All right.

33:37.767 --> 33:39.600
Don't.

33:40.666 --> 33:42.600
Don't what?

33:44.167 --> 33:46.401
You can do better for yourself than

33:46.467 --> 33:48.933
"comfortable"

33:49.000 --> 33:53.533
or "maybe getting some feelings back."

33:53.600 --> 33:55.434
Hold out for more.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.167
What?

33:59.134 --> 34:01.234
What am I holding out for?

34:04.601 --> 34:06.633
Everything.

34:08.666 --> 34:10.434
Hold out for everything.

34:13.967 --> 34:15.867
You know, that's easy for you to say.

34:15.933 --> 34:17.967
You had everything.

34:41.733 --> 34:43.632
Who's there?

34:52.067 --> 34:55.833
Carl, why are you here?

34:55.900 --> 34:59.501
You said there would be forgiveness for me, you lied.

34:59.567 --> 35:01.334
Did you look into the light?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.933
I saw it, but they told me I couldn't go in.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Why not?

35:05.067 --> 35:06.167
Because of my shame.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.603
But you apologized.

35:08.669 --> 35:10.736
I mean, you tried to make things right.

35:10.903 --> 35:12.370
You can come out of the shadows now.

35:12.437 --> 35:14.502
No, I can't. They're looking for me.

35:14.569 --> 35:16.569
They want me to go with them.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.836
Those spirits are angry because of what you did.

35:18.903 --> 35:21.036
Nobody can keep you from the light.

35:21.103 --> 35:24.103
It's not them. It's the others.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.003
The others?

35:25.070 --> 35:27.036
Spirits I've never seen before.

35:27.203 --> 35:29.403
But they said they know you.

35:29.469 --> 35:30.836
They know me?

35:30.903 --> 35:33.703
They said they gave you a warning, but you didn't listen,

35:33.769 --> 35:36.303
And something you cherished was lost.

35:36.370 --> 35:38.136
And?

35:38.203 --> 35:42.736
They said you believed in things that weren't right,

35:42.803 --> 35:47.669
And trusting those things might hurt others...

35:47.736 --> 35:49.602
And you.

35:55.003 --> 35:56.102
Hello?

35:56.469 --> 35:58.070
I'm here.

35:58.336 --> 36:00.602
What do you want from me?

36:00.669 --> 36:03.303
What did I do to offend you?

36:03.370 --> 36:05.803
You did nothing.

36:05.869 --> 36:08.270
Then why did you take my husband away?

36:08.336 --> 36:11.803
Fate did that, not us.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.969
You came to me and you said

36:14.036 --> 36:15.803
That death would touch something that I loved.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.569
And before I knew it, he was dead.

36:17.636 --> 36:20.236
We just warned you to be careful.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.503
Yeah. 'cause that's what you were doing was warning me

36:22.569 --> 36:23.936
With all your lies and threats.

36:24.003 --> 36:27.236
We don't lie or make threats.

36:27.303 --> 36:29.969
You told Carl that he couldn't cross over.

36:30.036 --> 36:31.869
The light has never denied anyone.

36:31.936 --> 36:33.503
The light doesn't make the choice.

36:33.602 --> 36:35.003
We each do.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.170
We? You mean you.

36:38.236 --> 36:42.437
No, each of us for ourselves.

36:42.503 --> 36:46.170
You wondered why these lake spirits stayed earthbound.

36:46.236 --> 36:48.437
Well, it's the same reason that Carl did.

36:48.503 --> 36:53.370
When the light opens, we each see ourselves reflected back.

36:53.437 --> 36:55.803
So Carl's shame kept him here.

36:55.869 --> 36:58.170
When spirits feel unworthy,

36:58.236 --> 37:01.769
sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living.

37:01.836 --> 37:04.402
to make ourselves worthy.

37:04.469 --> 37:06.070
What spirits stay back to do that?

37:06.136 --> 37:08.769
I haven't seen any.

37:08.836 --> 37:10.736
You're meeting four of them now.

37:10.803 --> 37:12.403
You?

37:12.470 --> 37:14.303
Why do you think we're still here?

37:14.370 --> 37:18.036
So when Carl said that you asked him to join you...?

37:23.803 --> 37:25.070
Carl?

37:25.136 --> 37:28.303
They explained it to me, and I understand now.

37:28.370 --> 37:29.503
This is what I want.

37:29.569 --> 37:30.803
Are you sure?

37:30.869 --> 37:32.736
Because they said it's your choice.

37:32.803 --> 37:34.303
You can move on now.

37:34.370 --> 37:38.403
I want to be one of them.

37:38.470 --> 37:39.869
All right.

37:39.936 --> 37:43.503
Will you help me fix the wrongs I did?

37:43.569 --> 37:44.769
How?

37:44.836 --> 37:47.403
By taking away their shame.

37:57.003 --> 37:59.769
Thank you all for coming tonight.

37:59.836 --> 38:02.003
We'd asked for family and friends,

38:02.070 --> 38:06.103
And I just never realized how many friends we have.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.669
- Hey, Eli. - Hi, Sam.

38:07.736 --> 38:10.270
I wasn't sure what to say,

38:10.336 --> 38:15.903
So I asked my darling english major Paula for some help.

38:15.969 --> 38:18.602
And she wrote down some thoughts for me.

38:18.669 --> 38:22.636
Paula? Don't be shy.

38:31.070 --> 38:33.403
"Tonight we send our loved ones

38:33.470 --> 38:36.236
"to where we thought they'd already gone.

38:36.303 --> 38:39.403
"It seems like a detour,

38:39.470 --> 38:42.936
"an embarrassing wrong turn.

38:43.003 --> 38:47.103
"but the truth is, we never knew where they were going.

38:47.170 --> 38:52.170
"We pretended we did, and that made us feel better.

38:52.236 --> 38:55.503
"But every path leads to the unknown.

38:56.836 --> 39:01.736
"some paths join others, and some split off on their own.

39:01.803 --> 39:06.203
"we want to know where they all go, but maybe we shouldn't.

39:06.270 --> 39:09.936
"maybe the more we insist on knowing,

39:10.003 --> 39:15.070
"the less we'll be able to learn from life's twists and turns.

39:15.136 --> 39:18.936
"I know what you're thinking,

39:19.003 --> 39:22.437
"that the unknown is scary.

39:24.170 --> 39:26.602
"But that's ok.

39:26.669 --> 39:28.903
"we're human.

39:28.969 --> 39:32.769
"maybe before we feel free,

39:32.836 --> 39:36.936
"we're supposed to feel fearful.

39:37.003 --> 39:40.036
"Maybe it means more that way.

39:41.869 --> 39:46.203
"So let's all say goodbye now.

39:46.270 --> 39:50.803
"and remember, that no matter what we're feeling,

39:50.869 --> 39:55.170
"there's no shame.

39:55.236 --> 39:56.503
No shame at all."

40:44.270 --> 40:45.303
Melinda.

40:45.370 --> 40:47.103
Oh, hey, Sam.

40:47.170 --> 40:50.136
Nikki's downstairs.

40:50.203 --> 40:52.070
She wanted to talk to you first.

40:52.136 --> 40:53.470
First?

40:58.003 --> 40:59.836
Nikki...

41:01.903 --> 41:03.503
Melinda.

41:04.736 --> 41:08.969
Heh, I...I don't know why you've been so nice to me.

41:09.036 --> 41:12.403
Letting me stay here in your house, when obviously...

41:12.470 --> 41:13.736
Nikki...

41:13.803 --> 41:15.669
It's not easy to say this,

41:15.736 --> 41:18.370
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

41:18.437 --> 41:20.136
And whatever you're feeling right now,

41:20.203 --> 41:23.070
I hope you can understand why I did what I did.

41:23.136 --> 41:26.569
Someday maybe you'll see that it was for the best.

41:26.636 --> 41:28.170
You don't have to...

41:28.236 --> 41:31.669
The weirdest part is Sam is this whole other guy.

41:31.736 --> 41:36.537
He's a grown-up who realizes he wants more.

41:36.602 --> 41:38.669
He talks about holding out.

41:38.736 --> 41:40.069
And that's sort of amazing,

41:40.069 --> 41:45.203
because everything I've been holding out for,

41:45.270 --> 41:47.736
He is ready to give.

41:49.569 --> 41:52.336
And I don't know why,

41:52.336 --> 41:55.103
but I feel like I have to thank you for that.

41:58.769 --> 42:00.936
No hard feelings, I hope.

42:03.203 --> 42:06.702
You...you deserve every happiness.

42:07.769 --> 42:09.437
Thank you.

42:13.736 --> 42:15.602
Thank you.

42:33.470 --> 42:35.070
Thanks for coming.

42:38.303 --> 42:41.903
Please, uh...

42:41.969 --> 42:44.236
Just be happy.

42:49.370 --> 42:51.003
Bye.

42:55.836 --> 42:57.537
Bye.
