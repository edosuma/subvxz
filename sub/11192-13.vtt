WEBVTT

00:10.500 --> 00:12.160
<i>We're almost through.</i>

00:12.179 --> 00:14.089
OK, now push it!

00:14.099 --> 00:15.973
Push!

00:23.778 --> 00:25.855
Would you look at this?!

00:27.298 --> 00:29.789
Many suspected
there was another chamber,

00:29.780 --> 00:34.359
but the Mexican government
wouldn't let us dig to confirm it till now.

00:34.939 --> 00:36.813
What's this?

00:39.460 --> 00:41.618
It looks like a sarcophagus.

00:41.619 --> 00:44.786
Burial chambers in Mayan
temple mounds are very rare.

00:45.060 --> 00:46.719
Here.

00:46.740 --> 00:49.231
Look for glyphs, pictographs.

00:49.819 --> 00:52.226
Something to give us a hint who's inside.

00:57.179 --> 00:59.386
<i>Hieroglyphics!</i>

01:02.579 --> 01:03.658
My God!

01:04.659 --> 01:06.319
They're Egyptian!

01:06.340 --> 01:10.171
That doesn't make any sense. Egyptian
hieroglyphics in a Mayan temple?

01:10.099 --> 01:13.966
I read a journal article once by a young
archaeologist. What was his name?

01:13.899 --> 01:16.769
Uh... Dr. Jackson.

01:16.739 --> 01:18.198
Dr. Daniel Jackson.

01:18.219 --> 01:23.807
<i>He was laughed right out of academia for
his preposterous ideas about...</i>

01:23.658 --> 01:27.408
a connection between
various ancient civilisations.

01:28.379 --> 01:33.289
Maybe Dr. Jackson was onto something.
I recognise one of these pictographs.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.135
It's of the goddess Hathor.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.694
The Egyptian goddess.

02:18.098 --> 02:20.933
<i>Where is Ra?</i>

02:20.899 --> 02:23.817
I assume you mean the God Ra?

02:23.778 --> 02:27.194
- You are not Goa'uld.
- What's that?

02:32.498 --> 02:35.500
Dr. Kleinhouse and
his associates were killed brutally.

02:35.459 --> 02:41.960
The authorities suspected crypt robbers,
going after a burial vault with this.

02:42.457 --> 02:44.533
And who thought to send it here?

02:44.538 --> 02:47.030
<i>Uh, Dr. Kleinhouse's other associates.</i>

02:47.020 --> 02:51.646
They recognised the significance of an
Egyptian sarcophagus in a Mayan temple.

02:51.538 --> 02:56.746
Since I was the only one to ever research
cross-pollination of ancient cultures,

02:56.618 --> 02:59.026
they tracked me down.

03:00.139 --> 03:04.137
- I know this thing.
- Yeah. I recognise it, too.

03:04.057 --> 03:08.103
- It's like that thing on Ra's ship that...
- Brought Sha're and I back to life.

03:08.018 --> 03:10.723
- Well, how could it be?
- I don't know.

03:10.699 --> 03:14.909
But if it does belong to a Goa'uld,
it would explain why no one's in it,

03:14.818 --> 03:18.519
and why it has Egyptian hieroglyphs
on it instead of Mayan.

03:18.457 --> 03:21.376
- General Hammond, sir.
- What is it, Airman?

03:21.337 --> 03:25.383
Sir, a person was just arrested
for attempting an unauthorised entrance.

03:25.298 --> 03:28.465
Happens every now and then.
Let the police handle him.

03:28.418 --> 03:31.537
It's a her, sir. Major Lowel
thought you'd want to talk to her.

03:31.497 --> 03:32.661
Why?

03:33.139 --> 03:35.760
Sir, she knew the Stargate was here.

04:56.617 --> 04:58.408
Sirs.

05:06.737 --> 05:09.442
Ma'am, I'm General Hammond,
US Air Force.

05:11.817 --> 05:13.894
- Yes?
- And you are?

05:13.898 --> 05:15.355
We are Hathor.

05:15.377 --> 05:18.581
You would be wise to unbind us
and kneel before your goddess.

05:20.536 --> 05:21.995
Hello.

05:22.016 --> 05:24.009
- Hathor?
- Yes.

05:24.018 --> 05:26.343
Have you heard of her?

05:26.338 --> 05:30.086
Hathor was the Egyptian goddess
of fertility, inebriety and music.

05:30.016 --> 05:33.682
- Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll?
- In a manner of speaking, yeah.

05:35.817 --> 05:39.401
Um, are the cuffs absolutely necessary?

05:45.576 --> 05:48.281
Surprised we didn't
chain her to the bed, too.

05:48.257 --> 05:50.547
What's she gonna do? Beat us up?

05:53.417 --> 05:55.290
I'm sorry about that.

05:56.177 --> 05:58.252
Thank you.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.437
Your efforts shall not go unrewarded.

06:14.697 --> 06:16.524
So, Ms. Hathor,

06:16.536 --> 06:20.699
would you mind telling us why
you were trying to get into this facility?

06:20.617 --> 06:23.653
<i>- We were drawn to the Chaapa-ai.
- Chaapa-ai?</i>

06:24.415 --> 06:27.750
That's what your monk buddies
on Chulak call the Stargate.

06:28.935 --> 06:32.601
Um, yes. It's also Abydonian
and ancient Egyptian.

06:32.536 --> 06:36.663
- What makes you think it's here, ma'am?
- We were drawn to it.

06:37.216 --> 06:38.877
"We"?

06:39.456 --> 06:41.329
Where is Ra?

06:41.336 --> 06:44.207
- Ra is...
- Dr. Jackson! Need to know.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.345
Ra... Ra is a myth.

06:48.336 --> 06:50.744
He doesn't actually exist.

06:51.418 --> 06:53.494
Miss... Hathor,

06:54.497 --> 06:56.987
what made you think
this Chaapa-ai was here?

06:56.975 --> 07:00.641
The Chaapa-ai was what gave power
to our father and our husband.

07:01.418 --> 07:03.125
Who's she talking about?

07:03.137 --> 07:07.798
Um, Hathor was both the daughter
and wife of Ra in Egyptian mythology,

07:07.697 --> 07:10.151
until Ra was said to have corrupted her.

07:10.137 --> 07:14.050
<i>- We were not corrupted!
- Of course. No disrespect intended.</i>

07:13.976 --> 07:17.725
- We are the mother of all pharaohs.
- Of course we are!

07:19.016 --> 07:20.675
General.

07:22.216 --> 07:24.624
<i>Why don't we call
County Mental Health?</i>

07:24.615 --> 07:28.235
See if we can find
a nice little rubber room for the lady.

07:28.175 --> 07:31.093
Crazy or not,
I wanna know what she knows.

07:31.055 --> 07:35.848
Dr. Jackson, see what you can find out but
don't tell her anything she doesn't know.

07:35.735 --> 07:37.810
OK.

07:38.536 --> 07:40.612
You, with the crown of marble!

07:42.456 --> 07:44.947
<i>She might mean you, sir.</i>

07:46.576 --> 07:49.696
- You are the ruler here?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:50.656 --> 07:52.649
- May we take your hand?
- Why?

07:52.656 --> 07:55.860
We wish to kiss it.
To bless you with fertility and joy.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.591
- Well, you can't pass that up, sir.
- Yes, I can.

07:59.536 --> 08:04.031
Sir, it might help me
if you play into her delusions,

08:03.937 --> 08:06.771
just to keep her talking.

08:38.456 --> 08:39.653
Now...

08:41.096 --> 08:45.094
- Where is Ra?
- Ra, your husband?

08:45.014 --> 08:49.308
<i>Where... is... Ra?</i>

08:50.176 --> 08:51.836
Um...

08:52.696 --> 08:55.863
I hate to be the one to tell you,
but Ra is dead.

08:57.775 --> 09:00.313
- How?
- He was killed.

09:05.735 --> 09:07.610
This is wonderful.

09:08.895 --> 09:11.600
- It is?
- How did he die?

09:11.576 --> 09:15.110
Uh... We killed him.

09:15.735 --> 09:18.688
Then we owe you our gratitude indeed.

09:18.655 --> 09:23.282
Perhaps we should choose you
to be our new beloved.

09:25.654 --> 09:27.730
Together...

09:28.455 --> 09:30.530
we should celebrate.

09:43.174 --> 09:45.250
Come.

09:56.816 --> 09:59.602
Do we really think
anyone'll believe that woman

09:59.576 --> 10:03.442
if she goes around
blabbing about a "Stargate"?

10:03.934 --> 10:06.889
I have a hard time
believing this woman on 73rd

10:06.855 --> 10:10.140
who talks about these devil people
that live in her hair.

10:10.095 --> 10:12.171
Though she could use some conditioner.

10:12.735 --> 10:16.067
<i>Is not the question...
how does she know of the Stargate?</i>

10:16.014 --> 10:21.436
- Dr. Jackson's figuring that out now.
- I believe I have figured that out, sir.

10:23.375 --> 10:28.167
She knows a lot. Either she's studied her
Egyptian mythology very carefully or...

10:28.375 --> 10:31.707
- Or what, Dr. Jackson?
- Or she's actually lived it.

10:31.655 --> 10:34.657
- Meaning?
- She's a Goa'uld, sir.

10:35.096 --> 10:36.341
What?

10:37.053 --> 10:38.713
How is she a Goa'uld?

10:38.735 --> 10:42.020
She could not have come
through the Stargate.

10:41.974 --> 10:46.186
She's been imprisoned in stasis
on Earth for almost 2,000 years.

10:49.014 --> 10:52.301
Is mental illness contagious?

10:53.414 --> 10:56.534
General Hammond, I think she is Hathor.

10:57.735 --> 11:02.196
- Or the Goa'uld that took on her persona.
- Back up. Did you say she's a Goa'uld?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.929
Yes. She feels indebted to us
for killing Ra,

11:04.894 --> 11:07.764
who she was trying to stop
from enslaving Earth.

11:07.735 --> 11:11.019
See, she's always been
a friend of humanity.

11:10.975 --> 11:13.181
Hathor was a much-loved goddess.

11:13.174 --> 11:15.629
- Are you saying she wants to help us?
- Yes.

11:15.614 --> 11:19.480
To defeat Apophis and
protect us from other evil Goa'ulds.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.073
You bought into all this?

11:22.134 --> 11:26.427
General, I'd like permission to have
Hathor come down here and debrief us.

11:26.333 --> 11:29.120
Whoa, Danny! I don't think so.

11:29.094 --> 11:30.587
<i>General.</i>

11:34.213 --> 11:36.289
I think you sense what I do.

11:36.693 --> 11:38.354
Hathor is a friend.

11:45.213 --> 11:48.131
Yes, I do believe that. Bring her down.

11:48.455 --> 11:50.530
- Are you kidding?
- Whoa, General!

11:50.533 --> 11:52.241
Colonel!

11:52.933 --> 11:55.506
- Sir, are you sure?
- Yes, Colonel.

11:57.293 --> 11:59.370
General.

12:02.214 --> 12:06.461
I have served the Goa'uld.
I have yet to meet a good one.

12:06.374 --> 12:09.991
Maybe that's because
you served the wrong one.

12:09.934 --> 12:13.470
Sir, at least close the blast door
so she can't see the gate.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.495
We thank you
for allowing us in your court.

12:27.453 --> 12:28.913
You're welcome.

12:37.453 --> 12:39.991
We would appreciate a drink
from your water.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.366
Colonel.

12:43.134 --> 12:44.164
General?

12:45.054 --> 12:47.130
Colonel, water for the lady.

12:49.653 --> 12:51.730
Yes. Of course, sir.

13:00.614 --> 13:04.991
You are the one who is responsible
for destroying the vile one Ra.

13:04.894 --> 13:07.100
I would be the one.

13:07.092 --> 13:11.754
For you... we will for ever
hold a special place...

13:11.653 --> 13:13.113
here.

13:14.893 --> 13:17.644
Well, that's... very special.

13:17.613 --> 13:19.072
Thank you.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.169
She is a Goa'uld.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.288
Jaffa.

13:54.173 --> 13:58.040
In service to Apophis, the Serpent.
Vile creature that he is.

13:57.972 --> 14:00.048
I am no longer in the service of Apophis.

14:00.053 --> 14:04.347
We despise all that Ra, Apophis
and their kind do and believe.

14:04.253 --> 14:06.080
It's all right.

14:06.092 --> 14:08.001
So does Teal'c.

14:08.852 --> 14:11.937
Then your enemy is our enemy.

14:12.613 --> 14:15.864
Together we can defeat them.

14:15.812 --> 14:18.101
I will serve no Goa'uld.

14:25.453 --> 14:29.238
- What do you say, General?
- I say we make the lady comfortable

14:29.173 --> 14:31.878
and welcome her.

14:32.212 --> 14:34.963
General, sir, I have a problem with this.

14:35.732 --> 14:37.606
Hathor,

14:37.613 --> 14:39.688
this is Captain Carter.

14:44.613 --> 14:46.902
You are an exceedingly beautiful woman.

14:48.094 --> 14:50.169
Thank you. So are you.

14:51.332 --> 14:56.409
General Hammond, I believe we should
keep Ms. Hathor under house arrest until...

14:56.293 --> 14:59.460
- Don't be impolite, Captain!
- Impolite? She's a Goa'uld.

14:59.413 --> 15:01.322
She is a guest of this facility.

15:01.332 --> 15:05.033
General, this doesn't make any sense.
Colonel O'Neill?

15:04.972 --> 15:10.975
I am in command of this facility, Captain,
not Colonel O'Neill. Is that understood?

15:10.812 --> 15:12.970
- But, sir...
- Understood?

15:13.452 --> 15:15.029
Well, sir, with respect,

15:15.052 --> 15:19.548
it seems this woman has all you guys
under some sort of spell or something.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.453
Are you questioning my orders, Captain?

15:23.971 --> 15:26.260
Yes, sir, I guess I am.

15:26.251 --> 15:29.004
Colonel, are you gonna back me up?

15:29.572 --> 15:31.648
Yes, Captain.

15:32.572 --> 15:34.648
If I see that there's a problem.

15:36.172 --> 15:38.248
Thank you, Colonel.

15:38.852 --> 15:42.186
Now, if you'll follow me,

15:42.133 --> 15:45.880
I would be honoured
to give you a tour of our facility.

16:02.852 --> 16:04.928
This is the guest quarters.

16:05.812 --> 16:07.889
This will do fine.

16:09.331 --> 16:12.417
We'll post a couple of guards outside.

16:12.370 --> 16:13.913
Guards?

16:13.932 --> 16:16.009
To protect us or...

16:16.572 --> 16:18.649
to protect everyone else?

16:24.010 --> 16:26.086
- Colonel.
- Sir?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.941
Let's forget the guards.

16:29.932 --> 16:31.806
Are you sure, General?

16:35.250 --> 16:37.788
You can trust us, Colonel.

16:40.572 --> 16:42.813
Oh, that's not in question, ma'am.

16:43.972 --> 16:49.097
But it is our policy to secure...
all quarters.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.460
Of course, um...

16:55.292 --> 16:58.875
The guards probably aren't necessary.

17:00.251 --> 17:02.125
Our thanks to you.

17:07.852 --> 17:12.145
<i>Um...
I suppose we should let you get some...</i>

17:12.851 --> 17:14.309
rest.

17:15.971 --> 17:17.217
Yes.

17:23.892 --> 17:25.968
Dr. Jackson.

17:26.569 --> 17:29.571
Please remain. We have other questions.

17:34.412 --> 17:36.072
Sure.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.375
It is time that you become
our chosen one.

17:47.010 --> 17:48.256
Chosen one?

17:48.290 --> 17:50.781
Will you always honour us?

17:52.451 --> 17:57.445
- Yes.
- Would you... die for us?

17:57.810 --> 17:59.886
Die...

18:02.411 --> 18:04.487
Yes.

18:09.891 --> 18:12.808
- Colonel, here you are.
- Here I am, Captain.

18:13.412 --> 18:17.491
I wanted to have a word with you, sir,
about Hathor, if you don't mind.

18:17.411 --> 18:21.990
- Fascinating lady, isn't she?
- A little too fascinating, don't you think?

18:21.891 --> 18:23.349
What do you mean?

18:23.371 --> 18:28.032
Well, sir, she seems
to have you all so... infatuated.

18:27.931 --> 18:30.422
- Us all?
- Yes, sir. The men.

18:30.412 --> 18:33.911
Don't you think it's dangerous
to give a Goa'uld royal treatment?

18:33.852 --> 18:37.635
- Relax, Captain. She's on our side.
- So she says.

18:40.211 --> 18:43.211
Captain, if you don't mind my saying so,

18:43.172 --> 18:48.249
you're treating her the way you hate to
see people treat Teal'c. Double standard?

18:48.131 --> 18:50.836
Teal'c has proven
whose side he's on. She hasn't.

18:50.810 --> 18:54.808
Have you ever heard the old saying
"My enemy's enemy is my friend"?

18:54.730 --> 18:58.348
Yes, but even when the CIA grants
sanctuary to an enemy turncoat,

18:58.289 --> 19:00.960
they never trust him.
They watch him like a hawk.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.007
Daniel's watching her right now.

19:04.530 --> 19:06.404
Relax.

19:15.651 --> 19:20.810
Tell us, our beloved, what are
the questions swelling in your mind?

19:20.691 --> 19:24.605
I spent years studying you as a student,
and now I'm with you.

19:24.529 --> 19:28.147
Do you know you're described in history
as the most beautiful woman

19:28.089 --> 19:32.917
that ever has or ever will be able
to control men with just your beauty?

19:33.451 --> 19:35.942
We are pleased to see you, old friend.

19:36.970 --> 19:40.304
It won't be long before
you will serve us once again.

19:43.410 --> 19:49.496
Tell us. Do you believe this to be true,
now that you have come to know us?

19:49.330 --> 19:52.534
Well, I certainly have
a deeper understanding of it now.

19:53.410 --> 19:57.703
We are the queen of the gods.
We are the mother of all gods.

19:58.290 --> 19:59.750
Yes.

20:01.089 --> 20:02.963
What does that mean exactly?

20:02.970 --> 20:06.303
From us, all others come.

20:06.849 --> 20:08.676
I don't understand.

20:08.691 --> 20:12.190
The Jaffa, he has
a Goa'uld child in his belly?

20:12.131 --> 20:14.124
A larva, yes.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.835
Did you ever wonder
from whence the children come?

20:17.369 --> 20:22.957
- Are you saying they come from you?
- Yes. And others like us.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.567
My God!

20:26.049 --> 20:29.549
You're like a queen bee!
You create the Goa'ulds!

20:40.569 --> 20:42.857
Captain Carter, what are you doing?

20:42.849 --> 20:46.930
- You noticed how the men are acting?
- Yes! Thank you. You noticed, too?

20:46.851 --> 20:51.429
It all seems to be tied in to the arrival
of this Hathor person or whatever she is.

20:51.329 --> 20:55.162
- I'm researching her right now on the Net.
- What have you found?

20:55.089 --> 20:58.837
This is really Daniel's field,
so I'm kinda starting from scratch.

20:58.770 --> 21:03.183
One web page theorises that a bunch
of sex goddesses from different cultures

21:03.089 --> 21:05.795
were actually all
the same woman - Hathor.

21:06.529 --> 21:09.067
The Greeks identified her with Aphrodite.

21:09.049 --> 21:13.260
There's Ishtar of Babylon,
Astarte of Syria, Ceres of Rome.

21:13.170 --> 21:16.336
- Sounds like she got around.
- Yeah, in most mythology.

21:16.288 --> 21:20.500
And she's pretty loved in all of it,
except for a late period in ancient Egypt

21:20.410 --> 21:24.574
where, according to one story,
she was sent by Ra to destroy mankind.

21:24.489 --> 21:27.359
Then he changed his mind
and they became enemies.

21:27.329 --> 21:32.750
- So she really may be Ra's enemy?
- Yeah, but here's the interesting thing.

21:32.609 --> 21:37.022
According to the stories, this woman
had magical powers over men.

21:36.931 --> 21:41.058
She was supposed to be able to
seduce them into doing anything for her.

21:40.970 --> 21:45.182
In almost every case, it describes them
as "drunk with her presence".

21:45.769 --> 21:48.392
- Well, that's how I'd describe our boys.
- Yeah.

21:48.369 --> 21:53.709
Now, I figure she's using some form
of Goa'uld technology. Any ideas?

21:54.729 --> 21:58.263
My guess would be some sort of
chemical we've never seen.

21:58.209 --> 22:02.917
Pheromones combined with Sodium
Pentothal. Probably airborne delivery.

22:03.368 --> 22:05.657
Great. How do we reverse it in the men?

22:05.648 --> 22:08.435
May not be reversible.
And if it is, it may take years.

22:08.409 --> 22:12.655
<i>We probably don't even have days before
she does whatever she's trying to do.</i>

22:12.569 --> 22:14.561
So what do you suggest?

22:15.569 --> 22:17.894
I suggest we neutralise her.

22:18.807 --> 22:21.049
So you actually create the larvae.

22:21.969 --> 22:23.428
How?

22:23.450 --> 22:28.657
We first need the code of life from the
juices of the species intended as the host.

22:29.929 --> 22:31.173
Code of life?

22:31.209 --> 22:35.420
In order to assure compatibility
for the Goa'uld child and the host.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.836
DNA.

22:40.848 --> 22:43.635
You mean you need DNA
to prevent rejection?

22:44.088 --> 22:45.749
The code of life.

22:47.210 --> 22:51.788
We do so enjoy the method of
procuring the code in your species.

22:55.729 --> 22:59.263
It is much more pleasurable than most.

23:00.568 --> 23:02.229
I bet.

23:02.249 --> 23:04.871
Since you are to be our first pharaoh,

23:06.009 --> 23:09.875
you will honour us
by being the one to contribute the code.

23:10.368 --> 23:13.240
You want me to help you
create more Goa'ulds?

23:23.528 --> 23:29.531
Now that Ra is gone,
we are finally free to rule this planet.

23:30.087 --> 23:33.422
With you, our beloved, at our side

23:34.087 --> 23:36.578
for all eternity.

23:41.568 --> 23:43.229
OK. Here's what we know.

23:43.249 --> 23:47.993
This creature who calls herself Hathor
is a Goa'uld, or some form of Goa'uld.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.844
So she has who knows what
kinds of weapons or defences.

23:50.807 --> 23:55.137
It may take a lot of fire power to neutralise
her. We must come at her from all flanks.

23:55.048 --> 23:58.797
- You know how to use this?
- Yeah, but I haven't touched one in years.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.720
Just point and pull the trigger.

24:00.729 --> 24:05.935
And don't hurt any of our men. They're
all loopy, so they shouldn't be a problem.

24:05.807 --> 24:08.096
Captain Carter.

24:08.768 --> 24:10.310
We must speak of Hathor.

24:10.327 --> 24:15.155
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- Do you not trust me, Captain Carter?

24:16.488 --> 24:20.817
All of the men on this base are under
Hathor's control, from what I can tell.

24:20.728 --> 24:24.310
- I hate to break it to you, but you're male.
- I'm a Jaffa.

24:24.249 --> 24:27.700
The Goa'uld I carry within me
protects me from Hathor's powers.

24:27.648 --> 24:31.065
- It is only together that we may stop her.
- From doing what?

24:31.008 --> 24:33.084
It is legend among the Jaffa

24:33.087 --> 24:36.872
that the original Goa'uld larvae
come from the queen Goa'ulds.

24:36.807 --> 24:39.180
- You think Hathor's one of them?
- Yes.

24:39.169 --> 24:42.501
If I am correct,
this base will become her nest.

24:42.449 --> 24:46.528
From here she will populate your world
with new Goa'uld.

24:46.448 --> 24:48.736
I cannot permit this to happen.

24:49.648 --> 24:53.349
<i>Captain Carter,
we cannot permit this to happen.</i>

24:59.607 --> 25:01.683
Glad you're with us, Teal'c.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.682
Is this really necessary?

25:06.688 --> 25:09.440
Somebody's bound to see
what's going on here.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.942
Yeah, and if they're male,
they'll be under Hathor's control.

25:12.888 --> 25:16.636
Besides, when was the last time you saw
a new woman get assigned here?

25:20.728 --> 25:22.601
Daniel?

25:24.288 --> 25:26.364
You OK?

25:26.847 --> 25:28.508
Where is she, Daniel?

25:31.207 --> 25:34.243
Captain, we found her.
She went into the locker room.

25:34.207 --> 25:36.282
Right. Let's go.

25:38.367 --> 25:40.858
Daniel, you OK?

25:42.886 --> 25:44.346
Captain!

26:30.008 --> 26:31.881
<i>Rin tel nok!</i>

26:34.287 --> 26:38.534
Stand down, Captain Carter,
unless you plan to kill us.

26:47.326 --> 26:50.661
Is this any way to treat a guest, Captain?

27:00.646 --> 27:03.137
It must be a powerful drug Hathor's using.

27:03.125 --> 27:06.460
Colonel O'Neill is trained to fight
mind-control techniques.

27:06.406 --> 27:09.325
Well, not Goa'uld techniques, apparently.

27:09.287 --> 27:11.825
Yeah, well, Mama said
there'd be days like this.

27:11.807 --> 27:14.345
Really? My ex-husband said that.

27:14.326 --> 27:18.324
"You outta your mind, honey? There
is a reason they call it this man's army."

27:18.247 --> 27:20.038
He actually said that?

27:20.048 --> 27:24.508
Yeah. So I said it wasn't the army, but the
air force. They've had women for years.

27:24.406 --> 27:25.652
Man!

27:25.686 --> 27:27.144
Maybe it's just me,

27:27.165 --> 27:31.210
but I can't figure out how to feel like
one of the guys with these guys.

27:31.126 --> 27:33.285
I always feel like I'm "the girl".

27:35.288 --> 27:36.948
- That's it.
- What?

27:36.965 --> 27:39.587
You gave me an idea
on how to get us outta here.

27:39.566 --> 27:42.900
If Hathor's control drug
is hormone-driven like I suspect,

27:42.846 --> 27:45.799
that means
she's making the men libidinous.

27:47.007 --> 27:51.586
OK... Why do I get the feeling
I don't like where this is going?

27:53.366 --> 27:55.240
Excuse me, ma'am.

27:57.405 --> 28:01.320
I'm, uh, sorry to barge in on you,
but I'd like to ask some questions.

28:01.246 --> 28:03.535
- About?
- About you, actually.

28:05.007 --> 28:07.083
See, you've...

28:08.326 --> 28:12.276
You've got me off balance,
and that's unnatural for me.

28:12.205 --> 28:14.992
We are told by the one
that you call Daniel

28:14.965 --> 28:17.800
that you are responsible
for ridding us from Ra.

28:17.768 --> 28:22.512
Yeah, we touched on that earlier, but I'd
like to be the one asking questions now.

28:22.406 --> 28:25.324
We must praise you
and give to you a great honour.

28:25.286 --> 28:28.619
Yeah, I'm sure that'd be just great.
But not right...

29:07.086 --> 29:09.162
Do not worry yourself.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.913
You will enjoy the rich rewards
that come with what we are giving you.

29:13.846 --> 29:17.381
You will cherish
the good health and long life

29:17.326 --> 29:19.402
that goes with being...

29:23.125 --> 29:27.075
<i>Hathor's first new Jaffa.</i>

29:39.086 --> 29:43.165
You know, using seduction wasn't
in any AF training manuals I've read.

29:43.086 --> 29:46.835
You think the Pentagon anticipated
an alien walking onto a base

29:46.766 --> 29:49.008
and drugging the men to make them...?

29:49.006 --> 29:51.127
- Libidinous?
- Yeah.

29:51.125 --> 29:54.210
They do train us to take advantage
of the enemy's weakness.

29:54.165 --> 29:55.660
Exactly.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.723
All right. Let's do it.

30:01.205 --> 30:03.910
Airman, open up!
We've got something for you.

30:04.565 --> 30:07.851
- What?
- Why not come in and see for yourself?

30:07.806 --> 30:10.344
No can do.
We only take orders from Hathor.

30:10.326 --> 30:14.276
<i>Gentlemen, there are
five women in here very alone.</i>

30:16.444 --> 30:19.648
Why do I feel like
I'm in a women-behind-bars movie?

30:26.724 --> 30:30.224
- What are you suggesting, ladies?
- Whatever you want, Airman.

30:47.924 --> 30:50.250
Feel like a woman, Doc?

30:50.244 --> 30:52.118
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's tie 'em up.

30:57.006 --> 30:59.082
Hold it right there, ladies.

31:02.765 --> 31:04.840
Drop your weapon.

31:08.925 --> 31:10.799
Yeah. My career is over.

31:10.805 --> 31:14.008
Don't worry. I'll fix him up
as good as new when this is over.

31:13.964 --> 31:16.455
Great. So he can bring me up on charges.

31:30.084 --> 31:33.915
- I am pleased to see you, Captain Carter.
- I'm glad someone is.

31:33.845 --> 31:36.798
Lock these guys up and stay here. OK?

31:37.045 --> 31:38.704
Yeah.

31:48.325 --> 31:52.108
- OK. Let Teal'c and me take the lead.
- No argument there.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.119
On three.

32:44.723 --> 32:46.799
Do not worry, child.

32:47.525 --> 32:49.730
You will soon receive your Goa'uld.

32:50.884 --> 32:54.218
And then you will begin
to feel strong again.

33:06.083 --> 33:09.951
The strongest of the larvae will soon
find your womb and move into it.

33:13.204 --> 33:16.324
At that moment
you will begin your service to us.

33:16.884 --> 33:18.757
<i>Enjoy.</i>

33:26.403 --> 33:28.278
Let's get him out of there.

33:33.044 --> 33:35.119
<i>OK, Colonel, we got you.</i>

33:41.522 --> 33:43.598
OK.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.699
Here, take this.

34:01.923 --> 34:03.584
Ugh...

34:07.364 --> 34:09.771
No. Nothing went in there yet.

34:10.204 --> 34:12.409
- This is a good thing.
- Oh, maybe.

34:12.402 --> 34:17.195
He no longer has an immune system.
Without a Goa'uld larva he will soon die.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.159
Shouldn't we take him to the infirmary?

34:26.164 --> 34:30.208
- You do not have the technology to help.
- We can at least make him comfortable.

34:30.123 --> 34:33.706
The Goa'ulds have the technology,
and Hathor brought it to us.

34:33.643 --> 34:35.516
Sarcophagus.

34:55.603 --> 34:58.521
I have seen the Goa'uld chamber
do many miracles.

35:32.682 --> 35:34.057
Ah!

35:42.443 --> 35:44.353
Stop!

35:44.362 --> 35:46.271
You will harm our new Jaffa.

35:51.762 --> 35:53.637
Ah!

35:56.762 --> 35:58.637
What's going on?

36:03.762 --> 36:05.755
Colonel!

36:11.442 --> 36:13.518
I don't think this is good.

36:25.081 --> 36:26.956
- You all right?
- Yeah.

36:26.961 --> 36:29.963
- Good to have you back, Colonel.
- What, I left?

36:39.922 --> 36:41.797
Whoa...

36:49.322 --> 36:51.445
- Colonel?
- Yeah?

36:51.442 --> 36:54.858
- D'you mind if I have a look?
- At what?

36:54.802 --> 36:59.380
Well, you were, um... uh...
Let's just say you were wounded.

37:03.601 --> 37:05.059
Wow!

37:05.083 --> 37:07.159
That's a miracle.

37:07.563 --> 37:09.639
Crunches.

37:09.641 --> 37:13.853
Too bad she blew up that sarcophagus.
We could use one in the infirmary now.

37:13.762 --> 37:15.505
Get yourselves down there.

37:17.643 --> 37:19.516
Now what?

37:19.521 --> 37:22.358
Now you and I go for that Goa'uld.

37:22.322 --> 37:26.070
How? She's guarded by our own men.
We can't exactly go in shooting.

37:26.762 --> 37:28.838
We can with tranquilliser guns.

37:28.842 --> 37:32.293
I thought of that, sir,
but there weren't any in the armoury.

37:32.242 --> 37:35.360
This is the military.
We always have more than we need.

37:35.322 --> 37:38.905
- There's a supply in lockup C.
- Be nice if someone told me that.

37:38.842 --> 37:40.918
Your tax dollar at work.

37:42.322 --> 37:45.407
<i>We demand
that the woman you call Carter</i>

37:45.362 --> 37:48.565
be brought before us
so we may gain retribution.

37:48.521 --> 37:50.929
Captain Carter
does deserve to be punished.

37:50.922 --> 37:55.085
But she does not know what she is doing.
I beg of you to show mercy.

37:57.282 --> 38:00.235
<i>She deserves no mercy from us.</i>

38:00.202 --> 38:02.907
She will make amends with her death.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.197
I don't think so.

38:16.440 --> 38:19.063
You have failed us, our love.

38:19.041 --> 38:22.161
You will not fail us again.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.902
No!

38:45.920 --> 38:48.626
Get these airmen outta here!
Daniel, let's go!

38:56.242 --> 38:58.567
You're all right, you're all right.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.717
All right, Danny.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.853
<i>Unauthorised gate activation.
All hands to the gate room.</i>

39:15.800 --> 39:17.876
<i>Unauthorised gate activation.</i>

39:29.280 --> 39:33.148
<i>- Where'd she go?
- Chulak. We have to go after her.</i>

39:38.240 --> 39:40.612
We will.

39:40.601 --> 39:42.143
Not right now.

39:42.159 --> 39:44.615
Hey. What's going on?

39:44.601 --> 39:47.353
I must have... blacked out.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.237
I guess she needs to stay
in proximity to keep control.

39:51.041 --> 39:52.914
Control what?

39:53.800 --> 39:56.291
What? What are you talking about?

40:08.601 --> 40:11.768
- Did you find anything?
- Probably nothing we can use.

40:11.722 --> 40:16.384
Maybe get a cellular level analysis on the
Goa'ulds, or find some DNA information.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.898
- A lot of that will probably be mine.
- You?!

40:20.641 --> 40:22.514
Yeah.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.253
- General Hammond, sir.
- At ease, Captain. At ease, Doctor.

40:28.201 --> 40:31.735
Thank you, sir. About your head,
I'd like to explain if I could...

40:31.679 --> 40:36.306
Captain, I'm putting you and Dr. Fraiser
up for a commendation medal.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.905
Well, thank you, sir, but I can explain...

40:40.800 --> 40:42.079
You are?

40:42.121 --> 40:46.201
If you hadn't kept your wits about you
and done whatever was necessary,

40:46.121 --> 40:49.157
we could have put
this entire planet at risk.

40:49.639 --> 40:51.882
Good job, ladies.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.858
Thank you, sir.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.956
Well, that's all.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.952
- Nice job.
- Yeah.
