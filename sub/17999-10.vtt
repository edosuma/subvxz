WEBVTT

00:03.392 --> 00:06.077
It says here that
if the Avengers had that fight

00:06.111 --> 00:07.495
That they had in Manhattan
in the movie...

00:07.529 --> 00:08.646
Uh-huh.

00:08.681 --> 00:11.215
$160 billion worth
of damage.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.701
- Wow.
- Who pays for it?

00:13.752 --> 00:15.586
Like, who's responsible
for the 160 billion?

00:15.621 --> 00:18.389
Well, I mean,
maybe they go after Stark,

00:18.424 --> 00:20.325
Since he's in the public eye.

00:20.359 --> 00:23.494
But I mean,
who has the cajones

00:23.529 --> 00:25.930
To be saved by the Avengers,

00:25.965 --> 00:27.632
And then to sue them
for saving them?

00:27.666 --> 00:31.502
I mean, let's say the Rhino
and Iron Man are fighting.

00:31.537 --> 00:33.087
They crush your car.

00:33.138 --> 00:35.206
He saved you,
but your car is gone now.

00:35.224 --> 00:37.508
You had no insurance,
you have nothing.

00:37.543 --> 00:39.444
I'm driving around
without insurance?

00:39.478 --> 00:40.645
I mean...

00:40.679 --> 00:42.947
- Okay.
- [laughs]

00:42.982 --> 00:46.184
In this fictional world,
let's assume that's true.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.694

01:21.620 --> 01:24.756
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:24.790 --> 01:26.474
The only show
that delivers the mail

01:26.508 --> 01:28.426
To Willie Lumpkin.

01:28.460 --> 01:29.861
- I'm your host, Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:29.895 --> 01:31.596
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

01:31.630 --> 01:32.897
Ming Chen.

01:32.931 --> 01:34.198
So what's been going on
this week?

01:34.233 --> 01:35.533
Something really weird,

01:35.567 --> 01:37.602
Really badass came
into the store the other day.

01:37.636 --> 01:38.970
I'm intrigued.

01:42.374 --> 01:43.408
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:43.442 --> 01:44.992
Thank you.
Have a great afternoon.

01:45.027 --> 01:46.210
- Hi.
- How's it going?

01:46.245 --> 01:47.578
- Good.
- I have something

01:47.613 --> 01:48.830
I wanted to bring by.

01:48.881 --> 01:50.681
- Oh, my god!
- See if you'd be interested.

01:50.716 --> 01:52.517
- [laughing]
- No way!

01:52.551 --> 01:55.420
- Wolverine claws, right?
- Wolverine claws.

02:01.727 --> 02:05.263
Now, wait a minute, wolverine
doesn't have bones and skulls--

02:05.297 --> 02:07.532
- Zombie Wolverine claws.
- Even better.

02:07.566 --> 02:09.834
So this is not licensed,
then-- Wolverine claws.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.235
No. No, it's not licensed.

02:11.270 --> 02:12.570
It still looks badass,
right?

02:12.604 --> 02:13.654
Is that real metal,
like...

02:13.689 --> 02:15.373
- Oh, yeah.
- Where'd you get this?

02:15.407 --> 02:18.776
There's this web site
I ran across that has all kind

02:18.811 --> 02:20.178
Of weird, crazy stuff.

02:20.212 --> 02:23.014
I saw it, and I was, like,
"man, that is neat."

02:23.048 --> 02:24.782
This is dangerous, man.

02:24.817 --> 02:26.734
Why would you want to sell it
at a comic book store?

02:26.785 --> 02:28.219
It sounds like
a legitimate weapon.

02:28.253 --> 02:31.289
I mean, it is. I mean,
it is truly something that--

02:31.323 --> 02:33.324
Like, you could take care
of business with this thing.

02:33.358 --> 02:35.443
Somebody gets in the store
and gets a little frustrated,

02:35.477 --> 02:37.261
They could just pop the claws
and stick, stick, stick.

02:37.296 --> 02:38.663
[laughter]

02:38.697 --> 02:41.399
Try it on.
Be careful.

02:41.433 --> 02:43.868
Do you feel like Logan--
Weapon X?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.403
Yes, I-I do.

02:45.437 --> 02:47.371
Do you think you can
go hunting with that?

02:47.406 --> 02:49.407
You against nature.
You go out and try

02:49.441 --> 02:52.059
To bag a deer
with just those claws

02:52.094 --> 02:53.544
I mean, I'd have to
chase down the deer.

02:53.562 --> 02:56.714
- I think maybe something slower.
- Like a sloth or something?

02:56.748 --> 02:58.983
No, not a sloth,
but like a moose, maybe.

02:59.017 --> 03:01.853
A moose would crush you,
even with those things.

03:01.887 --> 03:04.522
Wolverine versus Freddy.
Who wins?

03:04.540 --> 03:07.391
I think, hands down,
it's Wolverine, man.

03:07.426 --> 03:10.828
Unless Freddy Krueger has
some backup help

03:10.863 --> 03:13.698
From Edward Scissorhands.

03:13.732 --> 03:15.133
Then you've got a two-on-one
claw fight.

03:15.167 --> 03:17.568
- Edward Scissorhands?
- Yeah, he had claws for hands.

03:17.603 --> 03:19.036
He had kind of claw things
going on.

03:19.071 --> 03:21.272
Didn't he use 'em to cut
women's hair and bushes?

03:21.306 --> 03:22.440
[laughter]

03:22.474 --> 03:24.909
Hey, hey, hey.
We call them "pubic regions."

03:24.943 --> 03:27.044
[laughter]

03:27.079 --> 03:28.913
- Why are you selling it?
- When I got it,

03:28.947 --> 03:31.582
The dog saw it,
and she freaked out.

03:31.617 --> 03:34.051
And now every time
I kind of bring it out,

03:34.086 --> 03:36.521
She's hiding underneath
the table for a good day.

03:36.555 --> 03:39.056
All right, so what are you
looking to get for the claws?

03:39.091 --> 03:40.791
Uh, about 60 bucks.

03:40.826 --> 03:43.694
60 bucks, huh?
I don't know.

03:43.729 --> 03:45.896
60 bucks--it looks like
it's kinda almost like

03:45.914 --> 03:48.065
What you would quote, unquote,
call a "knock-off."

03:48.100 --> 03:50.267
It is a nice knock-off,

03:50.285 --> 03:52.236
But any way you slice it,
it's still a knock-off.

03:52.270 --> 03:53.704
- What? Dude...
- [laughs]

03:53.739 --> 03:54.772
Dude, watch where
you point those things.

03:54.806 --> 03:56.574
[laughter]

03:56.608 --> 03:58.142
Would you take $30
for it?

03:58.177 --> 04:00.611
I'd do $45.

04:02.814 --> 04:04.115
Mm...Yeah...

04:04.149 --> 04:05.383
Meet me in the middle.

04:05.417 --> 04:08.319
$37.

04:08.353 --> 04:10.471
Even $40.
I like even numbers.

04:10.505 --> 04:12.857
Sticked!

04:12.891 --> 04:14.008
All right,
we'll do $40 on it.

04:14.059 --> 04:16.260
All right.
Can we shake on it, like that?

04:16.295 --> 04:19.197
[laughter]

04:20.766 --> 04:22.967
All right, guys,
top ten robots of all time.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.235
Division?

04:24.269 --> 04:26.137
I was thinking more, maybe,

04:26.171 --> 04:27.405
Lost in Space robot.

04:27.439 --> 04:28.772
- [laughs]
- What are you laughing at?

04:28.790 --> 04:30.408
He's at the top
of your list?

04:30.442 --> 04:32.643
The danger--danger--

04:32.678 --> 04:34.478
Danger, Walt Flanagan.
Danger.

04:34.513 --> 04:35.646
Nothing you could be
talking about

04:35.681 --> 04:38.049
That is more important
than this right now.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.984
You've been here, man--
readies?

04:40.018 --> 04:41.419
I have. And?

04:41.453 --> 04:44.071
There are 97 sandwiches
on here, right?

04:44.122 --> 04:46.424
All named after businesses,
streets...

04:46.458 --> 04:48.459
- Okay.
- Guess what's not on here.

04:48.493 --> 04:49.660
What?

04:49.695 --> 04:51.662
- Secret Stash.
- Wow.

04:51.697 --> 04:55.232
Whoa, that's--
man, what a slap in the face.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.367
You know this dude?

04:56.401 --> 04:57.568
I mean, I've seen him.
He knows us.

04:57.603 --> 04:58.869
He must not know us.

04:58.904 --> 05:00.972
Why aren't we
on the menu, then?

05:01.006 --> 05:04.025
Call him. Tell him we want
a sandwich on the menu.

05:04.076 --> 05:06.460
We're a fixture in town.
We've been here for 15 years.

05:06.495 --> 05:08.613
Why not us?
Why can't we have a sandwich?

05:08.647 --> 05:09.814
Totally.

05:09.848 --> 05:10.915
I think there's
an old sandwich club.

05:10.949 --> 05:13.351
You know,
you gotta know somebody...

05:13.385 --> 05:16.053
Smells like sandwich
illuminati to me.

05:16.088 --> 05:18.456
[laughter]

05:18.490 --> 05:19.957
The Flash of Two Worlds.

05:19.975 --> 05:21.208
I was looking for $450.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.162
Let's pretend $50
is worth $1,000.

05:25.197 --> 05:26.931
What do we gotta do
to get on the menu?

05:26.965 --> 05:28.799
Why don't you guys
make the sandwich?

05:28.834 --> 05:30.234
A sandwich competition?

05:32.096 --> 05:33.763
So every sandwich
that readies sells

05:33.797 --> 05:35.465
They name after a business
in town.

05:35.499 --> 05:38.468
But somehow,
we're not represented

05:38.502 --> 05:40.403
- On the sandwich pool.
- Exactly.

05:40.437 --> 05:41.904
So I called him over.
I'm like, "come over. Now.

05:41.922 --> 05:43.106
We gotta talk to you."

05:43.140 --> 05:44.907
- You called?
- Tom, what's happening?

05:44.942 --> 05:46.075
- What's happening, brother?
- Hey.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.410
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. Good.

05:47.444 --> 05:48.961
We just wanted
to call you over

05:48.996 --> 05:51.130
And maybe talk a little bit
about your menu

05:51.165 --> 05:53.633
And its startling omission.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.636
- The Secret Stash.
- The Secret Stash.

05:56.670 --> 05:57.887
As if you didn't know.

05:57.921 --> 05:59.222
What do we gotta do
to get on the menu?

05:59.256 --> 06:00.490
Is there some sort
of selection committee

06:00.524 --> 06:02.725
- We gotta go in front of?
- It's all me.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.060
It's all you?

06:04.094 --> 06:06.295
So why don't you guys
make the sandwich?

06:06.330 --> 06:08.014
- What are your thoughts?
- Like a sandwich competition?

06:08.048 --> 06:09.132
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.867
- Let's do it.
- All right.

06:10.901 --> 06:11.901
Me and Mike.

06:11.935 --> 06:13.086
No, no, me and Mike.

06:13.137 --> 06:15.088
Why you--no.
It's always you and Mike.

06:15.139 --> 06:16.372
And it's always me and Bry.

06:16.390 --> 06:17.557
This time, let's switch it up
a little bit.

06:17.591 --> 06:19.409
No, no.
I want Mike on my team.

06:19.443 --> 06:20.993
- He's a trained chef.
- Oh, okay, all right.

06:21.028 --> 06:22.862
You figured me out.
All right.

06:22.913 --> 06:24.197
He was a chef 15 years ago.

06:24.248 --> 06:25.915
I know, but wait.
Let's hold on here a second.

06:25.949 --> 06:27.550
He's a chef.

06:27.584 --> 06:28.918
I don't even know
what a sandwich looks like,

06:28.936 --> 06:30.053
Basically.

06:30.087 --> 06:32.088
- What?
- I've never eaten a sandwich.

06:32.122 --> 06:34.891
[laughter]

06:34.925 --> 06:39.228
See, I thought,
here's a guy who is pure.

06:39.263 --> 06:41.264
There is nothing inside him
that is, like,

06:41.298 --> 06:42.932
"well, a sandwich has
to be this."

06:42.966 --> 06:45.034
He's got no corned beef
agenda.

06:45.069 --> 06:47.136
[laughter]

06:47.171 --> 06:48.671
You know what?
Screw it.

06:48.705 --> 06:51.441
Yeah, let's do it.
Me and you against you and Ming.

06:51.475 --> 06:52.642
- Cool.
- And how about you judge

06:52.676 --> 06:53.760
The sandwiches, then?

06:53.794 --> 06:54.911
Seems apropos.

06:54.945 --> 06:56.212
And whatever one
that tastes the best

06:56.246 --> 06:58.014
And looks the best,
that becomes

06:58.048 --> 07:00.650
That becomes the Secret Stash
superhero.

07:04.688 --> 07:06.989
- Hey, guys, how are you?
- How you doing?

07:07.024 --> 07:08.107
I brought you something
I thought you might

07:08.158 --> 07:11.427
- Be interested in.
- Flash of Two Worlds.

07:18.135 --> 07:21.187
The golden age Flash meets
the silver age Flash.

07:21.221 --> 07:22.805
The Flash of one world
is boring enough.

07:22.839 --> 07:24.907
Why do they need two?

07:24.942 --> 07:27.209
This is great because
it introduced to D.C. Comics

07:27.227 --> 07:29.428
The concept of a multiverse.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.748
There wasn't just one Earth
that this guy was on.

07:32.782 --> 07:35.218
There was another Earth
that this guy lived on.

07:35.252 --> 07:36.752
I always thought the Flash
was so cool

07:36.787 --> 07:39.255
Because he was always
so forthright, honest.

07:39.273 --> 07:40.523
- You know...
- Straightlaced.

07:40.557 --> 07:42.625
- Are you straightlaced?
- What can I tell you?

07:42.659 --> 07:44.827
I'm an attorney. It doesn't get
more straightlaced, right?

07:44.862 --> 07:46.529
You gotta follow
so many rules, right?

07:46.563 --> 07:49.282
Why don't you let your hair
down today, let's get crazy.

07:49.316 --> 07:50.533
Let's smoke some crack.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.970
- [laughter]
- I don't think I'd--

07:54.004 --> 07:56.339
Am I in the right place?

07:56.373 --> 07:59.108
No.

07:59.143 --> 08:00.776
What kind of law
do you practice?

08:00.794 --> 08:02.411
I do defense work.
Civil defense work.

08:02.445 --> 08:04.113
You're an ambulance chaser.

08:04.148 --> 08:05.248
No, no.

08:05.282 --> 08:07.283
I hope you're not gonna try

08:07.317 --> 08:09.886
To pull out some sort of vial
of fluid,

08:09.920 --> 08:11.220
Squirt it on the floor
at the Stash here today.

08:11.238 --> 08:12.288
No, no.

08:12.322 --> 08:13.539
My back! My neck!

08:13.574 --> 08:15.491
My neck and my back!

08:15.526 --> 08:16.859
No!

08:16.894 --> 08:19.245
It's fun to roast
a customer

08:19.279 --> 08:20.963
Every once in a while.

08:20.998 --> 08:22.281
You have to have
the perfect storm, as they say.

08:22.316 --> 08:24.700
You've gotta have a customer
come in that, you know,

08:24.735 --> 08:25.835
You could tell, you know,

08:25.869 --> 08:27.003
You could play around with
a little bit.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.471
And if you also have an item

08:28.505 --> 08:30.072
That you really
don't care about.

08:30.107 --> 08:31.057
That's a big part of it.

08:31.091 --> 08:33.042
All right,
all kidding aside,

08:33.076 --> 08:35.077
What are you looking for
for the statue today?

08:35.111 --> 08:36.746
I was looking for $450.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.315
- Okay.
- Keep looking.

08:39.349 --> 08:40.650
[laughter]

08:40.683 --> 08:43.836
Maybe on Earth II
we'd sell this for $450.

08:43.886 --> 08:45.855
Let's pretend
we're on Earth II.

08:45.889 --> 08:47.023
Okay.

08:47.057 --> 08:48.257
What do you think
we could do with this?

08:48.292 --> 08:50.693
Let's pretend,
on Earth II,

08:50.727 --> 08:54.864
$50 is worth $1,000.

08:54.898 --> 08:56.566
- Oof, no, no. Now...
- No?

08:56.600 --> 08:58.601
$60?

08:58.635 --> 09:00.303
[sighs]
No.

09:00.337 --> 09:02.705
I can go down to $400.

09:02.739 --> 09:04.640
Here's what you do.
You take it outside,

09:04.675 --> 09:06.642
Throw it through
the windshield of your car,

09:06.677 --> 09:09.946
Collect the insurance money,
don't get the windshield fixed.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.046
That's gonna give you
way more

09:11.064 --> 09:12.465
Than you ever would
have gotten here.

09:12.516 --> 09:14.584
- You want me to commit fraud.
- Little bit of insurance fraud.

09:14.618 --> 09:15.618
- Just a little bit.
- Come on,

09:15.636 --> 09:17.420
Like you haven't
done it before?

09:17.454 --> 09:20.957
Not even thought about it.

09:20.991 --> 09:22.458
Well, that is the best
I could do.

09:22.492 --> 09:25.061
So I think for now
I'm just gonna probably

09:25.095 --> 09:26.162
Put it back in the garage.

09:26.196 --> 09:27.530
All right, man. Sorry.

09:27.564 --> 09:28.664
You know, that's all right.
Thanks anyway, guys.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.232
I appreciate it.
Take care.

09:30.250 --> 09:31.634
Have a great day.

09:31.668 --> 09:34.437
What are you gonna do, man?

09:34.471 --> 09:36.772
The very first appearance
of Spider-Man.

09:36.807 --> 09:38.241
I mean, they talk about
key issues--

09:38.275 --> 09:39.942
This is the keystone!

09:42.474 --> 09:44.175
When was the first time
you saw Star Wars?

09:44.209 --> 09:46.010
Two weeks into
its initial run.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.547
My mom came home about a month
or two before it came out,

09:49.581 --> 09:51.182
And she goes, "you're gonna love
this movie that's coming out.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.384
It's about a wolfman
in outer space."

09:53.418 --> 09:54.885
And I was like,
"I am gonna love that movie."

09:54.920 --> 09:57.354
[laughter]

09:57.389 --> 09:58.939
Star Wars really
changed everything for me.

09:58.990 --> 10:03.461
It was the great
social lubricant of its day.

10:03.495 --> 10:05.563
Because of those figures,
like, you'd wind up

10:05.597 --> 10:07.448
Playing with people you probably
wouldn't have otherwise.

10:07.499 --> 10:09.166
Like, I remember hanging out
with John Kovic

10:09.201 --> 10:11.202
And Chris Dominguez
in grammar school,

10:11.236 --> 10:12.453
And they were more athletes.

10:12.504 --> 10:14.238
I didn't play any sports
or anything.

10:14.272 --> 10:16.106
But Star Wars was
the common bond for us.

10:16.141 --> 10:17.241
So even though--

10:17.275 --> 10:18.309
- That friendship was doomed
to failure.

10:18.343 --> 10:19.510
Why? Why?

10:19.544 --> 10:21.612
You know, kids will still
play football

10:21.646 --> 10:23.447
Into their teens.

10:23.482 --> 10:24.732
And, you know,
in their late teens,

10:24.783 --> 10:27.651
Most kids stop playing
with their action figures.

10:27.686 --> 10:31.355
- [laughter]
- Standing on the sidelines.

10:31.389 --> 10:35.125
Don't tackle him,
I've got a new Lando!

10:46.073 --> 10:47.573
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

10:47.608 --> 10:48.574
Something here
I think you might

10:48.608 --> 10:49.775
- Be interested in.
- Okay.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.278
It's been a treasure here
for a while.

10:52.296 --> 10:54.280
Oh, my God.

10:54.298 --> 10:55.515
And I think you might
be interested.

10:55.549 --> 10:56.749
The very first appearance
of Spider-Man.

10:56.783 --> 10:59.152
- Is this an original?
- It is original.

10:59.186 --> 11:00.820
It's the Stanley Cup
of comic books, boys.

11:00.854 --> 11:02.188
Oh, my God.

11:09.596 --> 11:11.864
This pretty much
ushered in

11:11.899 --> 11:13.032
The marvel age
of comic books.

11:13.066 --> 11:15.434
It was probably
one of the first times

11:15.469 --> 11:17.904
That a superhero had
major problems.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.155
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

11:19.189 --> 11:21.841
Basically, nothing ever
went right for Peter Parker.

11:21.875 --> 11:25.845
And it spawned
the neurotic superhero.

11:25.879 --> 11:27.647
'cause he was basically
Charlie Brown.

11:27.681 --> 11:29.982
<i>We have never had
an Amazing Fantasy 15</i>

11:30.016 --> 11:31.050
Come to the door.

11:31.084 --> 11:32.168
I mean, how many years
have we gone

11:32.219 --> 11:33.469
And been like,
"maybe today's the day"?

11:33.503 --> 11:34.620
Dude, nobody's gonna know
this is yours

11:34.655 --> 11:36.172
If you don't write
your name on it.

11:36.223 --> 11:39.358
[laughter]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

11:39.393 --> 11:41.377
It must have been
a nice book to see, man.

11:41.411 --> 11:43.596
Oh, it was like being
hit in the face

11:43.630 --> 11:45.198
With a web shooter.

11:45.232 --> 11:46.549
When the guy pulled out--

11:46.583 --> 11:47.767
- A comic book web shooter.

11:47.801 --> 11:49.035
[laughter]

11:49.069 --> 11:50.636
- Did you buy it off the stands?
- No.

11:50.671 --> 11:52.872
First birthday,
took him to a comic show,

11:52.906 --> 11:54.790
Back in 1982.

11:54.841 --> 11:56.442
The guy was anxious
to sell this

11:56.476 --> 11:58.561
For about $65 or so.

11:58.612 --> 12:01.931
After all these years, you're
looking to try to sell it?

12:01.982 --> 12:04.050
Yeah, it takes a lot
to part with it,

12:04.084 --> 12:05.885
But we think
it might be time.

12:05.919 --> 12:08.688
We have two granddaughters--
his two twins--

12:08.722 --> 12:11.624
Going to parochial school...
Tuitions and things like that.

12:11.658 --> 12:13.492
Home school 'em
and keep the comic.

12:13.527 --> 12:15.428
[laughter]

12:15.462 --> 12:16.996
- All right, guys.
- What's your pric

12:17.030 --> 12:18.998
What are you asking
for it?

12:19.032 --> 12:21.267
We're looking at
about 18.

12:21.301 --> 12:25.238
- $18,000?
- $18,000?

12:25.272 --> 12:27.139
Would you mind if I brought
somebody else in?

12:27.174 --> 12:28.691
Absolutely not.

12:28.742 --> 12:30.610
He's kind of our guy
that we go to

12:30.644 --> 12:34.480
When something comes in
that's of significant value.

12:34.514 --> 12:37.082
We brought Robert Bruce,
the pop cultures expert,

12:37.100 --> 12:38.784
Just because,
you know what?

12:38.819 --> 12:40.452
It doesn't happen every day
where a book of this magnitude

12:40.470 --> 12:41.470
Walks through the door.

12:41.505 --> 12:42.621
And, you know,
he would have killed me

12:42.639 --> 12:44.857
If I didn't call him.
[laughter]

12:44.891 --> 12:48.077
This is probably the greatest
silver age comic book

12:48.111 --> 12:49.262
Ever created.

12:49.296 --> 12:51.430
I mean, they talk about
key issues--

12:51.464 --> 12:52.898
This is the keystone

12:52.933 --> 12:54.984
That everything else Marvel
was built upon.

12:55.018 --> 12:56.102
What number would you put
on it, though,

12:56.136 --> 12:57.737
In terms of a grade?

12:57.771 --> 13:00.172
The edges are sharp
and clean.

13:00.190 --> 13:01.907
There's not a lot
a great deal of chipping.

13:01.942 --> 13:05.244
There is a nice tear
across the cover, unfortunately.

13:05.279 --> 13:09.932
The tape really detracts
from the overall condition.

13:09.967 --> 13:13.686
Cgc graded,
you're talking 2.0.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.988
I mean, if I was gonna
buy this book personally,

13:16.023 --> 13:18.491
I would offer you $2,500.

13:18.525 --> 13:21.661
I have to say
that's very disappointing.

13:21.695 --> 13:23.779
I probably could do
a bit better than that

13:23.814 --> 13:26.232
Because it is so significant.

13:26.266 --> 13:30.369
Um...Would you do $3,000?

13:30.404 --> 13:31.904
How about, like, $8,500?

13:31.938 --> 13:34.707
Ooh...Um...
I'm sorry, fellas.

13:34.741 --> 13:37.977
That's more than the book
is worth right now.

13:38.011 --> 13:39.228
Okay. I appreciate
your guys' time

13:39.279 --> 13:41.163
For taking to look at it.
Maybe another time.

13:41.214 --> 13:42.715
There you go, fellas.

13:42.749 --> 13:46.102
- Good night.
- Good night, now.

13:46.136 --> 13:47.803
That's, like,
Stash history.

13:47.854 --> 13:51.624
Well, no, history would have
been if we got the book.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.894
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

13:54.928 --> 13:58.197
Let's make some magic.
Let's get our oil going.

13:58.231 --> 13:59.765
Get that nice and hot.

13:59.783 --> 14:03.069
All right, first, flour.
Very nice.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.304
Chefy over here,
you know you've got this thing

14:05.338 --> 14:08.007
Dead to rights 'cause you've
cooked at a ret-rant.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.742
Yes. We went simple.

14:09.776 --> 14:11.510
You know, what do people like?
Fried chicken.

14:11.545 --> 14:13.979
Go simple and tasty.

14:14.014 --> 14:16.282
Be honest, though.
What did he contribute

14:16.316 --> 14:18.784
- To the whole sandwich?
- I had the taste buds.

14:18.819 --> 14:20.886
If that sandwich tasted like
crap, I would have told him.

14:20.921 --> 14:23.356
He made sure his butt
was chapped beyond red.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.891
"Ooh, that's a good sandwich!
[imitates munching]

14:25.909 --> 14:30.029
Ooh, that's a nice sandwich."
[imitates munching]

14:30.063 --> 14:32.031
This is real deal
gourmet cooking.

14:32.065 --> 14:34.133
Beautiful.

14:34.167 --> 14:36.402
- What is that?
- Secret ingredient.

14:36.436 --> 14:39.772
Apple jam, which is
oh, so delicious.

14:39.806 --> 14:41.574
- Awesome.
- There we go.

14:41.608 --> 14:44.510
The Secret Stash Superhero.

14:44.544 --> 14:46.345
What kind of sandwich
were you looking to make?

14:46.380 --> 14:48.814
We knew that these two squares
were gonna go in

14:48.849 --> 14:50.216
And make something, you know,
that the world has seen.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.785
- Something dainty.
- Yeah, yeah. Something safe.

14:52.819 --> 14:55.688
So we wanted to go
180 from that

14:55.722 --> 14:58.357
And make something
anti-establishment.

14:58.392 --> 14:59.959
The fight club
of sandwiches.

14:59.993 --> 15:01.010
Yes.

15:01.044 --> 15:04.029
Smoked turkey, your ham,

15:04.064 --> 15:06.532
Roast beef,
and your bacon.

15:06.566 --> 15:09.435
Ooh, that's gonna make me
vomit, bro. Eww.

15:09.469 --> 15:11.370
All right, well, you tell me.
What do you want to do first?

15:11.405 --> 15:13.038
I don't know.
Cut some bread.

15:13.073 --> 15:15.574
What, are you bailing
on me now?

15:15.609 --> 15:16.976
What, I can't
touch this stuff, man.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.310
What the hell
do you need me to do?

15:18.345 --> 15:19.945
I told you, man,
this is the strategy--

15:19.980 --> 15:22.715
Outside the box. You tell me,
I'll put it together.

15:22.749 --> 15:24.717
- Use it all.
- You want it all?

15:24.751 --> 15:28.687
Put it all on there, man.
Load that crap up.

15:28.722 --> 15:30.322
I would not have thought
of that.

15:30.357 --> 15:32.024
- Really.
- Yeah. It's genius.

15:32.058 --> 15:34.360
You're right. We'll put
everything onto one sandwich,

15:34.394 --> 15:37.196
And that's it, right?
- Booyah.

15:37.230 --> 15:38.597
This is as close
as we've ever had

15:38.632 --> 15:41.133
To a real, live superhero
walk in here.

15:41.168 --> 15:43.536
Gaze upon perfection.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.638
- What's in there?
- What's not in there, tom?

15:51.787 --> 15:52.887
- How you doing?
- Hello.

15:52.905 --> 15:54.589
I'm here to sell
my Chewbacca.

15:54.623 --> 15:56.507
Chewbacca, huh? Wow.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.126
I've always been
a wookiee fan.

16:06.268 --> 16:08.419
So where'd you get this from?

16:08.470 --> 16:11.606
I won it at a costume contest
and super-mega show.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.274
I was dressed up
as Captain America.

16:13.308 --> 16:15.109
You were dressed--
you know what?

16:15.143 --> 16:16.444
You could handle
a Captain America suit

16:16.478 --> 16:17.595
With those guns.

16:17.629 --> 16:19.363
You go to a lot
of costume contests?

16:19.398 --> 16:21.399
Um, no.
I do a lot of charity work.

16:21.450 --> 16:24.619
Charity work dressed in the
costume of Captain America.

16:24.653 --> 16:25.786
- Yes, sir.
- What made you decide--

16:25.821 --> 16:26.871
You're like,
"I'm just gonna dress up

16:26.905 --> 16:28.823
And just start doing
good deeds"?

16:28.857 --> 16:30.658
Growing up, I read
a lot of comic books,

16:30.676 --> 16:31.959
Especially Captain America.

16:31.993 --> 16:33.227
I got very into it.

16:33.262 --> 16:35.329
I was bullied a lot as a child,
and so I saw, like--

16:35.364 --> 16:36.731
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:36.765 --> 16:38.132
- Like Steve Rogers.
- Yeah.

16:38.167 --> 16:40.234
He's a strong role model
to kids that were weak

16:40.269 --> 16:42.836
And became strong
for other people.

16:42.855 --> 16:44.555
You ever been inspired enough,

16:44.606 --> 16:45.773
Maybe to, like,
say to yourself,

16:45.807 --> 16:47.225
"you know what?
I'm gonna go out there and do--

16:47.276 --> 16:49.810
I'm gonna go out on the real
streets, the hard streets"?

16:49.844 --> 16:51.195
I have. I was actually
a police officer

16:51.230 --> 16:53.548
- In Massachusetts.
- No way.

16:53.582 --> 16:55.650
- Mm-hmm.
- By far, this is as close

16:55.684 --> 16:56.934
As we've ever had
to a real, live superhero

16:56.985 --> 16:58.085
Walking in here.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.820
This guy was awesome, man.

16:59.855 --> 17:02.590
He--he actually looked like
a superhero.

17:02.624 --> 17:04.492
Not only his actions
were super-heroic,

17:04.526 --> 17:07.028
He had guns out to here.
Oh, he was a big dude.

17:07.061 --> 17:08.930
And he was so
super-respectful.

17:08.964 --> 17:11.048
I mean, it was literally
like talking to Steve Rogers,

17:11.098 --> 17:12.300
It felt like.

17:12.334 --> 17:14.285
Sounds like one of those
gentle giant types, man.

17:14.336 --> 17:17.171
Big dude, but, like,
comes across soft, like...

17:17.205 --> 17:18.289
- You just want to hug the guy.
- Yes.

17:18.323 --> 17:20.208
You just want to hug
this lovable lug.

17:20.242 --> 17:23.277
[laughter]

17:23.311 --> 17:25.630
So you won this
in the costume contest.

17:25.681 --> 17:27.281
Yeah, and never touched it.
Never used it.

17:27.316 --> 17:28.983
- Not a model man?
- No, not at all.

17:29.017 --> 17:31.452
I just left everything
as is.

17:31.486 --> 17:32.686
Okay. And you're looking
to sell it today?

17:32.704 --> 17:33.704
Yes, sir.

17:33.739 --> 17:34.855
What are you looking
for it for?

17:34.890 --> 17:36.690
Um, at least
the face value.

17:36.708 --> 17:38.542
I saw that it's worth,
like $65.

17:38.577 --> 17:39.860
At least that.

17:39.878 --> 17:41.746
We're not really
a model store, though.

17:41.797 --> 17:43.030
You look around,
we don't sell models,

17:43.065 --> 17:46.450
- And we don't have a lot of--
- You do now!

17:46.501 --> 17:49.253
Yes, sir.
[laughter]

17:49.288 --> 17:50.838
Um, yeah, we just
don't do models, though.

17:50.872 --> 17:54.775
So I mean, I'd be interested
in it, but not at $65, though.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.510
I'm just throwing this number
out there,

17:56.528 --> 17:58.813
Not to insult you,
of course.

17:58.847 --> 17:59.864
I have the utmost respect
for you and what you do

17:59.898 --> 18:01.282
And how you dress and--

18:01.316 --> 18:04.235
- But free.
- Oh... [laughs]

18:04.286 --> 18:05.903
"just give it to me."

18:05.954 --> 18:07.955
No, but I mean
would you take $10 for it?

18:07.990 --> 18:12.176
Um, is there any way
you can do $20?

18:12.210 --> 18:14.378
Just so I can get home.
- What?

18:14.429 --> 18:16.464
It cost me over $30
to get here.

18:16.498 --> 18:19.450
Cap's losing money
on this deal, thanks to you.

18:19.501 --> 18:21.786
- I don't want Cap to walk home.
- What a patriot.

18:21.837 --> 18:23.254
[laughter]

18:23.288 --> 18:25.456
Yeah, I paid
to come see you guys today.

18:25.507 --> 18:26.624
You know what?
I'll just go with $30.

18:26.675 --> 18:28.843
If it was anybody else
but Captain America

18:28.877 --> 18:30.061
In front of me right now...

18:30.095 --> 18:31.112
They'd be walking
out the door,

18:31.146 --> 18:33.180
Taking it on the arches?

18:33.198 --> 18:35.082
$30. $30's good.
I didn't know that

18:35.100 --> 18:36.684
You were--okay.

18:36.718 --> 18:39.203
Thank you.
Thank you very much, guys.

18:39.254 --> 18:40.588
- I really appreciate it.
- It was an honor meeting you.

18:40.622 --> 18:43.291
Thanks, man.
- Thanks a lot.

18:43.325 --> 18:46.160
Guys, I think it's about time
that the Secret Stash

18:46.194 --> 18:49.897
Has a sandwich
on readies' menu.

18:49.931 --> 18:52.500
Mike and Ming, can you unveil
your creation?

18:55.971 --> 18:57.905
- Very nice.
- We went simple, tom.

18:57.939 --> 19:02.209
Fried chicken with bacon,
extra-sharp cheddar,

19:02.244 --> 19:04.345
- And apple jam.
- You got apple jam in there?

19:04.379 --> 19:05.646
I was a chef.

19:05.681 --> 19:08.382
You're playing in
my playground now, bitches.

19:08.417 --> 19:09.900
I didn't think ming was
allowed within 1,000 feet

19:09.951 --> 19:13.371
Of any playground.
[laughter]

19:20.445 --> 19:22.513
Want me to get a bucket?

19:22.564 --> 19:25.666
Two buckets?
One for each end?

19:25.701 --> 19:28.636
[laughter]

19:28.670 --> 19:31.238
Okay, well, bryan,
it's time to unveil

19:31.273 --> 19:35.359
The masterpiece.

19:35.410 --> 19:39.113
Gaze upon perfection.

19:39.147 --> 19:41.849
- What's in there?
- What's not in there, Tom?

19:41.883 --> 19:43.484
The best of both worlds,
in terms of bread.

19:43.518 --> 19:44.852
We got portuguese
on one side,

19:44.886 --> 19:47.188
- Semolina on the other.
- Two breads.

19:47.222 --> 19:48.923
- You got your colby jack.
- Beautiful.

19:48.957 --> 19:52.593
- Two cheeses in one.
- Two cheeses. Two, count 'em.

19:52.627 --> 19:54.045
You got your fried chicken,
you got your grilled chicken.

19:54.079 --> 19:56.564
Two chickens.
Double-fistin' chicken.

19:56.598 --> 19:58.382
You got ham,
and you got bacon,

19:58.417 --> 20:02.970
Roast beef,
and your greens...Lettuce.

20:04.706 --> 20:07.141
Get a good bite there, tom.

20:07.175 --> 20:08.943
Go in for two.
There's two of everything.

20:08.977 --> 20:10.010
You might as well take
two bites.

20:10.045 --> 20:12.029
Huh? Huh?

20:12.064 --> 20:13.547
- He's goin' in for one more!
- Yeah!

20:13.582 --> 20:15.616
Thank you, guys.

20:15.650 --> 20:18.452
I think I've come
to a decision

20:18.487 --> 20:20.388
As to which sandwich
is gonna be

20:20.422 --> 20:24.358
The Secret Stash Superhero.

20:24.393 --> 20:27.161
And the winner is...

20:27.195 --> 20:28.162
Mike and Ming.

20:28.196 --> 20:30.297
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Pbbbt!

20:30.332 --> 20:32.233
[laughing]

20:32.267 --> 20:34.018
- You guys won.
- We won.

20:34.069 --> 20:35.519
That's gotta be
a huge day for you, Ming.

20:35.554 --> 20:37.371
I imagine you called
your parents.

20:37.406 --> 20:38.355
[laughter]

20:38.407 --> 20:39.440
"Hey, it finally happened!

20:39.474 --> 20:41.477
The bad boys got theirs!"

20:41.478 --> 20:44.478
[laughter]

20:44.479 --> 20:47.379
Just like every good
comic book mainly series,

20:47.380 --> 20:49.110
this is coming to an end.

20:49.111 --> 20:51.197
Till then, I'm you host,
Kevin Smith.

20:51.198 --> 20:52.698
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:52.699 --> 20:54.336
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.700
We gotta jam
like she's a aim, kids.

20:56.701 --> 20:57.701
So good night.
