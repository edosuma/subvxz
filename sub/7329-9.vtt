WEBVTT

00:07.742 --> 00:09.453
You tired?

00:09.477 --> 00:10.878
You can't catch me!

00:13.447 --> 00:15.559
You're not getting away!

00:15.583 --> 00:17.728
Give up, I got you!

00:17.752 --> 00:19.529
- Do not!
- You're done.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.145
Am not!

00:23.257 --> 00:24.492
Here I come!

00:26.293 --> 00:27.738
Tag... you're it!

00:27.762 --> 00:30.064
What's that?

00:31.098 --> 00:32.709
It's a scarecrow, stupid.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.361
- Now, come on, you're it.
- Wait, that.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.574
Let's just get out of here.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.083
Run, run!

01:33.427 --> 01:35.405
You're not taking the elevator.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.606
Nope, took the stairs.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.009
It's all about the cardio
these days.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.443
You have been looking
increasingly

01:40.467 --> 01:42.345
Kate Moss-ish there, McTim.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.147
What are you down...
two, three pounds?

01:44.171 --> 01:46.383
15 pounds, actually,
and thank you for noticing.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.385
Well, that's what
I do for a living.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.842
Eagle-eyed special agent.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.756
- Girl?
- No girl.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.890
Come on, McGee.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.292
Nobody gives up the pizza
and the donuts

01:55.316 --> 01:56.293
without a good reason.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.561
All right, you want the truth?

01:58.585 --> 02:00.563
I usually gain a few pounds
during the holidays,

02:00.587 --> 02:02.532
so, this year, I thought
I would counter it.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.833
Oh, you can resume

02:03.857 --> 02:07.504
your diet after
Thanksgiving, Timothy.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.674
The, uh, traditional
Mallard table

02:10.698 --> 02:13.910
is not for anyone
whose body isn't into

02:13.934 --> 02:16.713
bountiful good cheer.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.416
"A thanksgiving supper
at Mallard Manor.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.918
All the fixin's."

02:21.942 --> 02:24.654
I think you misspelled
"fixings."

02:24.678 --> 02:27.324
Uh, Ducky, Thanksgiving
is in two days.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.693
Yeah, well, I'm aware of that.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.628
I already have plans...
I'm gonna see my sister.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.196
Well, bring her with you.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.066
I also have accepted
an invitation

02:36.090 --> 02:38.301
for Thanksgiving...
uh, a neighbor.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.669
Oh, dear.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.072
And Mr. Palmer
is already out of town.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.541
Ducky, I also have plans.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.844
Are you letting some blonde
bombshell baste your bird, Tony?

02:47.868 --> 02:51.881
No, this bird's flying solo
to a poker tournament

02:51.905 --> 02:53.283
at the Big Bend Indian Casino.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.085
They've got
an all-you-can-eat crab buffet.

02:55.109 --> 02:57.287
Pilgrims and Indians
gambling together...

02:57.311 --> 02:58.321
that warms the heart.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.423
What about your mother, Ducky?

03:00.447 --> 03:02.659
Uh, Mother is comfortable,
thank you.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.061
Staff take good care of her.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.463
Poor dear.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.932
She barely recognizes me
when I visit.

03:08.956 --> 03:12.602
Well, then, uh, that leaves me
with a 20-pound bird

03:12.626 --> 03:14.437
and enough trimmings
to feed Coxey's Army.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.473
Not Army. Marines.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.141
Got a dead one in a cornfield.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.643
What, Duck,
you waiting for an invitation?

03:20.667 --> 03:23.480
Oh, yes, uh, here's yours.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.948
Thanksgiving.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.784
Here's yours.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.252
Cornfield.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.254
Let's go!

03:31.278 --> 03:32.956
Maybe I'm amazed.

03:32.980 --> 03:33.957
A maze of maize.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.092
What?

03:36.116 --> 03:37.494
"Maize"... it's the
Indian word for corn.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.597
The Indian word
for corn is makki.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.299
Not Indians from India,
Indians from, you know, here.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.768
Well, if they were
Indians from here,

03:44.792 --> 03:47.203
they would be called
American Indians, you dork.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.905
No, they'd be called
Native Americans,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.330
Miss Citizenship Test.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.644
DiNozzo, process this.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.212
Gibbs...

03:56.236 --> 03:59.482
several sets of footprints,
some of them very small.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.252
A couple kids found him.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.654
These aren't kids' footprints.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.823
Over here, those are big ones.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.024
Come from that direction.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.026
Drag marks.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.562
Which means that
when they pulled our Marine,

04:12.586 --> 04:13.630
he was dead already.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.632
Ah, fresh corn.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.899
That gives me an idea.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.168
Why don't we have corn chowder

04:19.192 --> 04:20.437
as our first course?

04:20.461 --> 04:21.738
Poker.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.972
Sister.

04:22.996 --> 04:23.996
Neighbors.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.677
Later.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.814
Based on the viscosity
of the blood...

04:30.838 --> 04:34.350
I'd say this is a recent demise.

04:34.374 --> 04:38.087
My instinct tells me
he was not shot here.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.990
This is Marine Lance Corporal
Trevor Lozada,

04:41.014 --> 04:42.358
stationed out of Quantico, boss.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.360
The corporal is missing a hand.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.996
He was killed prior
to it being removed.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.766
Otherwise, the blood pooling
would be much greater.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.035
Maybe the crows carried it off.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.894
Caw, caw!

04:56.430 --> 04:58.591
Sorry, I had to do it.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.144
Sorry, boss.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.378
Time of death:

05:02.402 --> 05:04.870
Eight to ten hours ago,
between 3:00 and 5:00.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.517
PCs...

05:07.541 --> 05:09.619
local gang, big up and down
the East Coast, boss.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.054
Of course,
you already know that.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.122
Maybe this is some sort of
initiation thing, you know?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.724
Kill a Marine and you're in,
no questions asked.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.926
Lance Corporal Lozada

05:16.950 --> 05:18.561
was a gang member
before he joined the Marines.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.263
His tat was lasered off.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.731
Why would somebody shoot him,

05:21.755 --> 05:24.519
bring him out here, carve
him up and cut off his hand?

05:27.394 --> 05:29.739
Ziva, get on
DiNozzo's shoulders.

05:29.763 --> 05:30.807
Boss?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.025
I would rather not.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.311
Bend over, Tony.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.479
Boss...

05:36.503 --> 05:38.232
Come on, Tony, use those quads.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.144
Oh, God, boss.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.658
- West.
- Turn this way.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.894
- Okay.
- Uh, police cars.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.095
North.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.397
A farmer on a tractor.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.833
East.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.835
Barn...

05:58.859 --> 06:00.503
200 yards away.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.772
I got a cramp in my neck.
I got a cramp.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.008
I don't think
they meant to hide him.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.144
I mean, this place
is not exactly isolated.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.980
So, whoever put
this body here...

06:11.004 --> 06:12.995
Wanted him found.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.861
Marine Lance Corporal
Trevor Lozada...

06:24.885 --> 06:27.330
had a spotless service
record, multiple tours.

06:27.354 --> 06:30.066
Rewarded with a very desirable
duty post

06:30.090 --> 06:31.667
guarding the Sattler Institute

06:31.691 --> 06:34.003
for Strategic Studies
and Analysis.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.671
R & D, government think tank.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.541
Naval War College and
Marine intel units use them.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.676
Lance Corporal Lozada had
been there about six months.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.911
I'm gonna call
the Sattler Institute,

06:41.935 --> 06:43.446
let them know
we're heading over.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.047
Current address on Lozada.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.250
McGee, you and Ziva
check out Lozada.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.251
DiNozzo, you're with me.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.519
Sattler Institute?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.988
Oh, boss, shouldn't
McSmarty-Pants go

06:52.012 --> 06:53.289
to the nerd theme park?

06:53.313 --> 06:54.657
I mean, it's gonna be
a nerd's paradise

06:54.681 --> 06:55.992
with the World of Warcraft
wallpaper

06:56.016 --> 06:58.060
and the pocket protectors
and the elfin-shaped beds.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.062
'Cause I probably shouldn't...

07:00.086 --> 07:01.454
I'll get the car.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.034
Hi. NCIS.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.602
Special Agents Gibbs
and DiNozzo.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.605
Yes, I'm Krista Dalton,
facilities coordinator.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.107
I spoke with someone
on the phone.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.409
Something happened to
Lance Corporal Lozada?

07:13.433 --> 07:16.679
He was found dead this morning
about 20 miles from here.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.347
Oh, my God.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.649
How did it happen?

07:19.673 --> 07:20.917
Not very nicely, Krista.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.253
What did Lance Corporal Lozada
guard around here?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.321
Um, I'll show you.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.389
Here.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.615
This way.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.196
He guarded a day care center?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.230
This isn't a day care.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.666
This is our intelligence
testing center.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.801
You test the intelligence
of these kids?

07:38.825 --> 07:40.703
No, they test ours.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.957
Hey, Parker, how's it going?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.043
Parker's specialty
is the redeployment

07:47.067 --> 07:48.477
of rapid response groups.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.013
Thought we had people
at the Pentagon who do that.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.081
We do.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.250
But we've found
that gifted children

07:54.274 --> 07:55.885
have a less linear,
less bureaucratic way

07:55.909 --> 07:58.054
of approaching things...

07:58.078 --> 08:00.911
simpler, cleaner, purer.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.761
Where are their parents?

08:05.785 --> 08:07.096
We have an arrangement
with the families.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.322
The kids visit us for
a week or two at a time.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.802
Helps maintain a nice
balance between home

08:12.826 --> 08:14.971
and here and keep
the kids focused.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.207
I guess it's fun.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.309
Well, these are just
puzzles and games to them.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.247
So you're telling me
Lance Corporal Lozada was

08:24.271 --> 08:25.681
a babysitter, basically.

08:25.705 --> 08:28.484
No, a bodyguard.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.621
These kids are incredibly
valuable to us and the military.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.823
Hey, uh, when do I get
my MP3 player back?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.025
When you stop wrapping the cord
around the ceiling fan, Brett.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.294
I was testing my aerodynamic
theory of glide ratio versus

08:39.318 --> 08:40.296
inverted torque.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.797
W-What are you looking at?

08:41.821 --> 08:43.532
Val Kilmer, Real Genius.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.702
Brett, you like to break things,
which is why you wrapped

08:46.726 --> 08:48.137
a cord around the ceiling fan.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.973
You will get your MP3 player
back after Thanksgiving.

08:50.997 --> 08:54.110
Okay, whatever.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.146
Brett's one of
our prize students,

08:57.170 --> 08:58.981
as well as one of the oldest.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.216
Yeah, he's a real smarty-pants.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.450
Lucky you.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.553
Any of these kids
personally close to Lozada?

09:04.577 --> 09:06.722
One... Angela Kelp.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.525
Angela had been acting
distracted lately,

09:09.549 --> 09:11.294
so I asked Lance Corporal Lozada

09:11.318 --> 09:12.628
to keep an eye on her.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.996
They hit it off.

09:14.020 --> 09:14.997
She around here somewhere?

09:15.021 --> 09:16.489
Yes, this way.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.734
Ooh!

09:18.758 --> 09:19.986
Sorry, boss.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.774
Get us out of here! Drive!

09:24.798 --> 09:25.808
I'm ready, Mr. Norvell.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.344
- What do you see?
- Mistakes.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.645
Would you care to elaborate?

09:29.669 --> 09:30.646
First, the sun.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.715
It's almost 30 degrees,

09:32.739 --> 09:34.850
directly into our troops' eyes,

09:34.874 --> 09:37.553
blinding them while concealing
the bad guys on the rooftop.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.055
- Go on.
- They should never have been

09:39.079 --> 09:41.524
in an open, exposed area
like this plaza.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.259
It gives
the enemy gunners a clear,

09:43.283 --> 09:44.794
unobstructed angle of fire.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.830
Yeah... but they were headed
to rescue a unit under attack.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.433
Yes. That's why they took
the most direct route.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.735
What they should have done
was taken a less direct route

09:52.759 --> 09:55.838
on narrower streets
with more vertical protection,

09:55.862 --> 09:57.373
taller buildings.

09:57.397 --> 10:00.127
Would have saved a lot of lives.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.438
Impressive.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.420
The art, I mean.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.322
Thanks.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.590
That's my cat back home.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.292
What's its name?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.127
Kimba.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.628
Lives with me and my mom.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.263
What about Dad?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.832
Split when I was little.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.134
Kimba's good at
taking out Taliban.

10:25.158 --> 10:28.104
You should see
what she does to mice.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.472
Agent Gibbs, NCIS,

10:29.496 --> 10:32.908
this is Gregg Norvell,
our director of youth programs.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.643
Whatever you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.145
Thanks.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.114
Something happened, didn't it?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.615
What do you mean?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.084
To Lance Corporal Lozada.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.099
Something happened
to him, right?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.791
Is there some place
the two of us could go talk?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.340
Yeah, your room.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.818
If you'd like to follow us.

10:57.524 --> 11:02.138
I had a combined
S.A.T. score of 950.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.993
Is that good?

11:05.765 --> 11:06.942
Do you want a cupcake?

11:06.966 --> 11:08.490
I made them.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.697
Thanks.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.493
So, what makes you think

11:24.517 --> 11:26.796
something happened
to Lance Corporal Lozada?

11:26.820 --> 11:29.812
Well, you're here, he's not.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.701
You want to talk to me

11:32.725 --> 11:34.370
because Trevor and I
were friends, right?

11:39.165 --> 11:42.511
Did somebody... kill him?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.730
Why would you ask that?

11:46.172 --> 11:48.851
Because people emote more
sympathy when it's an accident.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.353
You're searching.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.709
Curious.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.728
Do you know that a Marine
returning home from active duty

11:59.752 --> 12:00.996
has a 38% greater chance

12:01.020 --> 12:03.716
of being hurt or killed
than when he's deployed?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.222
Did you make these?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.340
They're good.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.843
Thanks.

12:13.867 --> 12:17.313
Krista says it's important
for me to express myself.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.448
Yeah, I think she's right.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.850
Just like it's important

12:20.874 --> 12:24.420
that, if you know anything
about Trevor,

12:24.444 --> 12:25.845
you should call me.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.592
Yeah. Gibbs.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.080
Where?

12:36.222 --> 12:37.951
Yeah, I'll be right there.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.357
Thanks.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.280
McGee.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.250
LEOs matched the car's
registration to Lozada.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.951
What's the distance
from the crime scene?

12:55.975 --> 12:59.588
About, uh, six miles.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.956
Didn't find anything
in his apartment,

13:00.980 --> 13:02.024
but you were right.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.193
He was a member
of the local gang... PCs.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.895
DiNozzo.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.963
Oh, hey. Look at that.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.431
There's one of the slugs

13:09.455 --> 13:11.734
we didn't find
in the lance corporal.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.969
I patched into
his on board MapSet program.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.972
This was his route to and from
Sattler Institute every day.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.008
And based on the time of death,

13:19.032 --> 13:20.442
Lozada must have just left work.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.610
Ziva.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.579
Someone nicked the fuel line.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.147
- Clean cut.
- Followed him

13:25.171 --> 13:27.550
till his tank ran dry,
pulled up and ambushed him?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.218
Took him to the cornfield.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.800
Hey, DiNozzo.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.162
Yep, it's Lozada's.

13:40.186 --> 13:41.830
Six incoming calls.

13:41.854 --> 13:45.000
All listed to the same number,
billed to the same address.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.168
Go.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.160
Find our missing caller.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.357
Got it. On it.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.812
So, you brought me in here

13:56.836 --> 13:58.881
for making phone calls
to a friend?

13:58.905 --> 14:00.349
No, Eddie, because you

14:00.373 --> 14:02.785
and Lance Corporal
Lozada were eses.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.520
The file here says

14:04.544 --> 14:07.823
that, uh, he broke off
his gang ties years ago.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.991
Clearly, you haven't.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.025
We had our disagreements,

14:10.049 --> 14:11.660
but me and Trev
were like brothers.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.329
Brothers? Really?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.164
Metro Gang Division says
that, uh,

14:15.188 --> 14:16.899
you tried to kill your brother

14:16.923 --> 14:19.268
a few years ago,
when he left the PCs.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.469
No.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.372
People felt betrayed,
but we worked it out.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.708
You worked it out.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.142
That doesn't smell
so good to me.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.644
Call me jaded.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.312
Lozada took an oath.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.313
He broke it.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.549
It pissed you off. Admit it.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.784
If I wanted to kill him
back then, I would have.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.286
Look, me and Trevor

14:37.310 --> 14:38.988
grew up together,
and he burned me, so...

14:39.012 --> 14:40.389
So, it's a grudge.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.558
No, we just had
some unsettled business.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.461
- Like what?
- Like you don't need to know about.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.632
Eddie...

14:49.656 --> 14:52.768
you are a real cool customer,
aren't you?

14:52.792 --> 14:55.137
Got to give you a hand.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.840
Speaking of hands...

14:57.864 --> 15:00.009
why'd you cut Trevor's off?

15:00.033 --> 15:02.544
Carve "PC" into his arm?

15:03.670 --> 15:04.847
That's a nice touch, Zorro.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.515
It's kind of like putting
up a billboard

15:06.539 --> 15:08.350
that says,
"Don't mess with the PCs,"

15:08.374 --> 15:11.553
and Eddie Castillo...
he's not afraid of anyone,

15:11.577 --> 15:12.554
including the Marines.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.589
I didn't do that.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.824
You got an alibi for last night?

15:15.848 --> 15:17.860
- Lullaby.
- Alibi.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.162
It's an after-hours club
for rich kids.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.598
We handle the...
refreshments there.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.832
Really?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.634
Well, we'll see about that.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.169
In the meantime,

15:27.193 --> 15:30.205
I hope you like being
swabbed, poked and pricked.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.607
Why?

15:31.631 --> 15:33.609
'Cause we're checking you
for gunshot residue,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.411
blood and dirt
from the crime scene.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.313
Anything I can think of.
You know why?

15:37.337 --> 15:38.964
'Cause you're messing
with my holidays.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.519
And I don't like it when people
mess with my Thanksgiving.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.621
Boss, you're going
to want to see this.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.690
According to security sensors,

15:47.714 --> 15:49.591
Lance Corporal Lozada
entered the dorm wing

15:49.615 --> 15:51.327
this morning at 6:00 a.m.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.528
That is impossible.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.596
- He was dead.
- Exactly.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.133
Dorm access requires
a palm scan, boss.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.702
Well, that clears up
one mystery.

15:59.726 --> 16:00.903
Someone needed his hand.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.690
Yeah, but here's
the strange part.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.744
That's Angela's room.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.879
- They take anything?
- No.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.648
Figure walked out
less than a minute later.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.451
All he or she was carrying
was Lozada's hand.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.353
All they did was
visit Angela's room.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.354
Then they left.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.606
Empty-handed.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.799
So, Angela, you didn't see
anybody in your room

16:30.823 --> 16:31.800
this morning?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.520
No... but I was asleep.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.272
Nothing missing?

16:37.296 --> 16:40.409
# Look around #

16:40.433 --> 16:43.645
# And think
where have you been... #

16:43.669 --> 16:46.160
Two of my collages are gone.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.586
Yeah?

16:50.610 --> 16:53.755
Anything special about them?

16:53.779 --> 16:55.424
Just collages.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.192
Stuff, art.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.729
# And don't forget #

17:00.753 --> 17:03.265
# That this will pass in time #

17:03.289 --> 17:05.701
Hey, would you mind
if I borrowed this?

17:05.724 --> 17:08.353
# It's cold out this morning #

17:10.930 --> 17:12.406
# You should be... #

17:12.431 --> 17:14.476
Okay.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.046
So, you know that your mom
knows you're coming with us

17:18.069 --> 17:20.435
and that you're safe, right?

17:23.275 --> 17:25.319
Sure you didn't see anything?

17:25.344 --> 17:27.189
Positive.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.522
Okay.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.460
Let's go.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.578
# Of year again. #

17:37.456 --> 17:38.934
Hey, Abby.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.336
Hang on a minute, Gibbs,
'cause this is important.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.772
It's my great aunt's cranberry
sauce recipe. I lost it,

17:43.796 --> 17:44.906
so I'm trying to duplicate it

17:44.930 --> 17:46.341
before Ducky's
Thanksgiving dinner.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.697
I don't want to let
Ducky's turkey down, you know?

17:50.536 --> 17:52.381
Abby.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.548
Today.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.017
What can I do for you, Gibblet?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.252
It's kind of a seasonal
play on your...

17:57.276 --> 17:58.520
I'm ready, sir.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.222
Turn this into pictures.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.044
Thought you were going to
give me something hard.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.264
So what are you bringing
to Ducky's dinner?

18:09.288 --> 18:10.399
Not sure I'm going.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.633
What do you mean,
you're not going?

18:11.657 --> 18:12.834
Who's going to carve the turkey?

18:12.858 --> 18:14.436
Who's going to watch
the game with me?

18:14.460 --> 18:15.771
Who's going to eat too much pie?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.764
Abby... the photos.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.511
What am I looking for?

18:22.535 --> 18:23.979
Girl's room.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.561
Panning shot.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.452
Oh, she listens to H Is Orange.

18:30.476 --> 18:31.577
What a cool little chick.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.157
This is how geeks recreate.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.592
Exhibit A.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.394
She's so cute.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.477
All right, stop it there.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.360
Okay, blow up that one
and that one.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.442
Those are cool. What are they?

18:53.466 --> 18:54.443
That's what
you're gonna tell me.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.678
Well, what am I looking for?

18:56.702 --> 18:59.281
I have... absolutely no idea.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.034
So it is hard.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.679
More sugar.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.094
Ah. Jethro.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.262
You know that
little bakery near you?

19:14.286 --> 19:16.765
I'd appreciate it
if you could bring

19:16.789 --> 19:18.767
a dozen of their dinner rolls.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.135
Got a confirmation
of death, Duck?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.237
Oh, gunshot wound to the head.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.472
Well, what I presume

19:23.496 --> 19:26.007
is the kill shot
entered his head here,

19:26.031 --> 19:28.877
just behind his right ear,
traveled in an upward direction.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.313
I was just about to find out
what damage it caused.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.314
Before he was posted?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.315
Oh, yes.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.083
Clearly, the killer's intention

19:35.107 --> 19:37.719
was to leave some sort
of macabre message.

19:37.743 --> 19:41.456
Yeah, and not too shy about
indicating who was sending it.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.358
Easy autograph to forge.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.293
Duck,

19:45.317 --> 19:48.548
I need a psych evaluation
on a 12-year-old girl.

19:49.588 --> 19:52.067
Where do you go, Jethro?

19:52.091 --> 19:53.235
What?

19:53.259 --> 19:54.870
Over the past
nine Thanksgivings,

19:54.894 --> 19:56.304
I've called your house;

19:56.328 --> 19:57.606
You're never home.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.530
Sometimes I even drive by.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.447
So, I shall expect you
promptly 1600 hours.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.315
Oh, that reminds me...

20:07.339 --> 20:10.085
I mustn't go home without him.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.954
Avoid sourdough rolls
if you can.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.423
Their flavor clashes
with my salad dressing.

20:15.447 --> 20:17.159
White bread is okay,

20:17.183 --> 20:20.175
but whole wheat
would be preferable.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.558
Oh, dear.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.106
Thanks.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.208
Can I get you something
to drink, Mrs. McKinna?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.845
You remembered, Agent Gibbs.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.047
Well, you're memorable, D'Arcy.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.716
Holiday plans, Mrs. McKinna?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.518
Sending a shopping list

20:43.542 --> 20:45.020
to my husband, as we speak.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.355
You cooking for the family?

20:47.379 --> 20:48.676
That's the plan.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.962
Why do I need a legal
youth advocate here?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.886
It's the law, sweetie.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.970
So, have you ever
killed anybody?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.928
Me?

21:05.664 --> 21:07.099
No.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.011
David.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.080
I'm ready for your young lady.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.549
Okay, I will bring her up.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.917
Mrs. McKinna?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.219
Oh, you go on ahead, Ziva.

21:17.243 --> 21:18.587
I'll be right there.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.604
I got all my bars, and I'm only
up to celery stalks.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.830
Gibbs. Ducky's waiting.

21:28.854 --> 21:29.931
Yeah.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.066
I'll take her up.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.667
Okay.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.318
Bye.

21:35.527 --> 21:38.540
You take the stairs up
but the elevator down?

21:38.564 --> 21:40.156
Knees.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.021
Okay.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.123
Got my attention.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.325
You think I'm hiding something.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.693
About Trevor.

21:58.717 --> 22:00.514
Are you?

22:04.056 --> 22:05.367
I told you.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.222
You're safe here.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.085
I know. That's not it.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.542
I'm not in danger.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.363
Who is?

22:21.607 --> 22:23.909
Nobody.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.074
Glad we talked.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.435
Hello, I'm Dr. Mallard.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.037
Please.

22:42.061 --> 22:45.240
And if you wish,
you can call me Ducky.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.709
Hello, Ducky.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.412
Dr. Mallard, you may proceed.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.881
I'm here if you need me, Angela.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.317
Well, now, Angela.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.018
Is this a psych evaluation?

22:57.042 --> 22:58.320
I know there are three types:

22:58.344 --> 23:00.622
General, emergency and clinical.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.580
This feels clinical to me.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.097
Hey.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.198
Ah, Jethro.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.666
I was just coming to see you.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.001
You all right, Duck?

23:13.025 --> 23:15.804
Yeah, well, she had me
talking about my first pet.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.373
It was a guinea pig
called Hunka Munka.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.775
Passed away, ooh, about
the time I was her age.

23:20.799 --> 23:24.045
Duck, you were supposed to
find out about her past.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.147
Yeah, well, all that
went extremely well.

23:26.171 --> 23:27.315
And?

23:27.339 --> 23:29.551
Well, if she is
suppressing memories,

23:29.575 --> 23:31.720
she does a remarkably
good job of it.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.254
I didn't get anywhere there.

23:33.278 --> 23:37.158
But I can tell you that
beneath that precocious bravado,

23:37.182 --> 23:39.594
there is a very
sensitive little girl.

23:39.618 --> 23:42.998
She may act twice her age,
but inside she's anything but.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.866
- Secrets?
- Yeah, and when she's ready,

23:44.890 --> 23:46.501
she will reveal them.

23:46.525 --> 23:48.003
But I wouldn't push her.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.472
Jethro, when I did just now,
she pushed right back.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.774
Hey, boss, here you go.

23:52.798 --> 23:54.409
Eddie Castillo's here again.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.510
Yeah, well, go talk to him.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.012
Me?

23:57.036 --> 23:59.014
Yeah, you got something
better to do, DiNozzo?

23:59.038 --> 24:00.582
Well, yeah, I got travel plans.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.783
No, go, talk.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.570
Right.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.592
Hey, miss me, Eddie?

24:10.616 --> 24:11.760
Look, I've got something to say.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.827
It's about why
I was calling Trevor.

24:12.851 --> 24:15.263
I'm all ears.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.967
Um... I have a cousin.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.769
He's nine years old.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.203
He's already
getting into trouble,

24:22.227 --> 24:25.640
and... I wanted to have
Trevor talk to him,

24:25.664 --> 24:27.308
uh, about that Marine stuff.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.644
Help straighten him out,
give him somebody to look up to.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.312
Other than you?

24:31.336 --> 24:32.347
Wow.

24:32.371 --> 24:33.581
That warms my heart.

24:33.605 --> 24:34.849
I'm serious, man.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.785
I can't let my crew find out

24:36.809 --> 24:39.788
that I'm trying to keep
my own blood out of this life.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.855
Yeah, it's all about honor

24:40.879 --> 24:42.023
and integrity with you,
isn't it, Eddie?

24:42.047 --> 24:43.491
You don't know anything
about me, man!

24:43.515 --> 24:45.060
I know plenty about you!

24:45.084 --> 24:47.862
I know you're not angry at
Lozada, you're jealous of him.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.765
'Cause he had the brains and
the guts to get out of the gang

24:50.789 --> 24:52.100
and you didn't.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.836
And he made something
of himself; You didn't.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.738
Trevor got out
'cause he had a real job

24:56.762 --> 24:58.406
and he could
take care of his family.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.841
They were proud of him,
you know.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.476
He earned that.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.544
But I didn't kill him!

25:02.568 --> 25:04.379
Look, he needed something

25:04.403 --> 25:05.380
from me, too, okay?

25:05.404 --> 25:06.848
He needed some advice.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.283
Something about
some girl in trouble.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.584
You're telling me

25:09.608 --> 25:12.687
that a decorated Marine
calls you instead of the cops?

25:12.711 --> 25:14.055
He said if he went to the cops,

25:14.079 --> 25:15.390
then the girl's life
would be in danger.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.391
I don't know why.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.760
Girl have a name?

25:18.784 --> 25:20.752
Angela.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.134
Mm. Sorry.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.036
My cousin Tetra's lime Jell-O

25:28.060 --> 25:30.772
with yams,
marshmallows and pecans.

25:30.796 --> 25:32.640
Some family traditions
should not be upheld.

25:32.664 --> 25:36.031
That really, really,
really sucked.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.113
Abby.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.948
In a jiffy, Gibbs.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.550
Did you know that "jiffy" is
one one-hundredths of a second?

25:42.574 --> 25:43.818
I mean, it's an actual thing.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.186
Unlike say, lickety-split,

25:45.210 --> 25:47.122
which has no scientific
meaning whatsoever.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.957
All right, we're almost there.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.092
Get there, Abbs, in a jiffy.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.927
There, okay.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.797
I applied a biometric
algorithm recognition program

25:55.821 --> 25:58.600
so the seemingly random
artistic patterns of her...

25:58.624 --> 26:00.802
You don't really care
how I got there.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.770
Okay, let's talk turkey.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.572
A code.

26:04.596 --> 26:05.974
It's more than a code, Gibbs.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.809
It's her own language.
She used 26 shades

26:07.833 --> 26:10.979
of color to correspond with
the 26 letters of the alphabet.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.081
Once I figured that out,
I was able to translate

26:13.105 --> 26:15.096
her art into letters.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.186
A poem?

26:18.210 --> 26:19.721
Yeah.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.090
And it's dark and creepy.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.892
Very detailed.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.326
It's called,
"The Lady in a Fountain."

26:25.350 --> 26:26.494
It's about death.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.062
It's a poem.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.098
Can you just ask me
about the second collage?

26:30.122 --> 26:31.362
Please, please, please, please.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.140
Abby, what am I looking at here?

26:39.164 --> 26:41.142
It's a frequency-jamming
signal, Gibbs.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.744
Frequency?

26:42.768 --> 26:44.679
For what?

26:44.703 --> 26:46.247
It's every communication code

26:46.271 --> 26:48.816
for every ship,
plane and helicopter

26:48.840 --> 26:51.786
in the United States Navy
and Marine Corps.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.289
I don't know why she was
hiding military secrets

26:54.313 --> 26:56.191
in her collages, unless...

26:56.215 --> 26:58.393
I don't know...
she was gonna sell them?

26:58.417 --> 27:00.461
Or someone else was for her.

27:00.485 --> 27:03.386
Bank records
for Angela's mother.

27:05.691 --> 27:09.537
Gibbs, Angela's mom
has called 13 times.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.539
- She wants to see her daughter.
- Yeah, she will.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.374
What'd you find, McGee?

27:13.398 --> 27:14.609
Angela's mom's average income

27:14.633 --> 27:17.912
for the past 16 years
is $43,000.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.113
Okay, more recently.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.882
Over the last three months,

27:20.906 --> 27:22.483
her mother's made
three additional deposits

27:22.507 --> 27:24.919
totaling 60 grand.

27:24.943 --> 27:26.387
So, either her mother's
playing the ponies...

27:26.411 --> 27:28.311
Or she's taking advantage
of her little girl.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.508
It's like those
Magic Eye posters,

27:47.532 --> 27:51.545
where you stare at them
and then, suddenly,

27:51.569 --> 27:53.347
you see that hidden image.

27:53.371 --> 27:55.983
Tony, Abby already un-hid it.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.119
It's frequency-jamming signals.

27:58.143 --> 27:59.420
No, maybe if I...

27:59.444 --> 28:01.455
Maybe if I try to unfocus...

28:01.479 --> 28:02.857
Focus, DiNozzo.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.859
That's it, boss.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.027
Out of focus.

28:06.051 --> 28:07.695
It's dolphins!

28:07.719 --> 28:09.030
In moonlight!

28:09.054 --> 28:10.097
Thank you, boss.

28:10.121 --> 28:12.099
Anytime.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.123
McGee.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.936
Anytime.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.774
Boss, the, uh,
frequency-jamming signals

28:19.798 --> 28:21.609
Abby pulled out of Angela's
collages are linked

28:21.633 --> 28:24.712
to a Naval/Marine maneuver
called Ballistic Winter.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.147
Now, copies of

28:26.171 --> 28:28.249
these jamming signals
appeared on the black market

28:28.273 --> 28:29.350
three months ago in China.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.786
It's an open NCIS investigation.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.888
There is no way that girl
stole state secrets.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.222
She is a child.

28:35.246 --> 28:36.757
You've clearly never
seen The Bad Seed.

28:36.781 --> 28:37.758
Interpol have suspects?

28:37.782 --> 28:39.545
Just one.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.830
Follow along here, boss.

28:42.854 --> 28:45.232
C-Ten Dynamics is
a U.S. defense firm

28:45.256 --> 28:49.090
that does R & D in conjunction
with the Sattler Institute.

28:50.161 --> 28:51.639
C-Ten's sales rep

28:51.663 --> 28:53.174
is a woman named
Debra Leigh Dalton.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.109
Dalton. Same last name

28:55.133 --> 28:56.777
as our think tank
coordinator, Krista Dalton.

28:56.801 --> 28:57.778
Sister?

28:57.802 --> 28:58.913
Affirmative.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.815
Uh, Debra is Krista's
younger sister.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.417
Maybe that was Debra
sneaking into Angela's room.

29:03.441 --> 29:05.019
I want to talk to Debra Dalton.

29:05.043 --> 29:08.155
Uh, boss, that's gonna be
a bit of a problem.

29:08.179 --> 29:10.324
Miss Dalton flew into D.C.

29:10.348 --> 29:13.594
five days ago,
but never got to her house.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.963
And there's no record of any
credit card or cell activity

29:15.987 --> 29:17.098
since she arrived.

29:17.122 --> 29:19.133
A mom, a daughter
and two sisters

29:19.157 --> 29:20.835
trading government secrets.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.350
It's like Hannah and Her Sisters
meets The 39 Steps.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.473
Sorry.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.540
Get Krista Dalton in here.

29:26.564 --> 29:29.343
Put Angela in a safe house.

29:29.367 --> 29:32.279
Safe houses have been
compromised... a computer glitch.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.482
Should be cleared by tomorrow.
Motel?

29:34.506 --> 29:36.317
Good luck finding one
right before Thanksgiving.

29:36.341 --> 29:39.208
Ducky has an extra room.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.758
You know, boss,
we've all got plans

29:43.782 --> 29:45.462
- this holiday season and...
- Cancel them.

29:53.658 --> 29:54.989
Play again?

30:02.200 --> 30:03.911
This kid's a ringer. Watch her.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.846
I know that, Ray.

30:05.870 --> 30:06.996
Hey, that's my money.

30:17.048 --> 30:18.526
So, what's the buy-in?

30:18.550 --> 30:20.060
For you?

30:20.084 --> 30:22.196
Two bucks.

30:22.220 --> 30:26.167
Okay, how about we play
for different stakes?

30:26.191 --> 30:28.435
What do you have in mind?

30:28.459 --> 30:31.238
I win, you tell me the truth.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.575
About Lozada...

30:34.599 --> 30:38.558
military secrets, everything.

30:41.706 --> 30:44.919
Found the jamming signals that
were hidden in your artwork.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.189
I wasn't hiding anything.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.524
It's just how my mind works.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.427
It's how I work out
puzzles they give me.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.462
I do it through art, images.

30:55.486 --> 30:57.977
Numbers, letters,
colors and shapes.

31:01.059 --> 31:04.038
You build things.

31:04.062 --> 31:06.440
Woodwork, right?

31:06.464 --> 31:08.694
My father made cabinets.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.102
Didn't you ever express yourself
in the things you made?

31:16.007 --> 31:20.221
How many people at the Institute
know what was in your artwork?

31:20.245 --> 31:22.790
I'm not sure.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.282
Safe house is ready.

31:33.791 --> 31:36.437
What is going on here,
Agent Gibbs?

31:36.461 --> 31:37.905
Why is NCIS holding my daughter?

31:37.929 --> 31:40.090
You've been getting
a lot of money lately.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.010
No, no.

31:43.034 --> 31:45.746
That is Angela's money.

31:45.770 --> 31:47.681
Look, I never wanted her
to go there.

31:47.705 --> 31:50.451
What mother wants to be
without her child?

31:50.475 --> 31:53.587
But Angela thought that
it would be good for her.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.289
She wanted to fit in somewhere.

31:55.313 --> 31:57.157
You really thought she was
getting paid all that

31:57.181 --> 31:58.592
just to play video games?

31:58.616 --> 32:02.529
We were told Angela's work
saved soldiers' lives.

32:02.553 --> 32:04.431
The money didn't matter.

32:04.455 --> 32:05.766
She felt good about helping.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.501
It all goes to her college fund.

32:07.525 --> 32:08.836
What are you suggesting?

32:08.860 --> 32:10.657
How'd the dollars get to you?

32:12.864 --> 32:16.744
The larger amounts came from
this company,

32:16.768 --> 32:18.579
C-Ten Dynamics.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.436
I assumed they were projects
Angela worked on.

32:27.011 --> 32:29.657
Payments were approved
by Debra Dalton.

32:29.681 --> 32:30.991
You know her?

32:31.015 --> 32:33.594
No, I only ever
talked to Krista Dalton.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.586
The checks come in the mail.

32:37.522 --> 32:38.499
Yeah. Gibbs.

32:38.523 --> 32:39.633
Boss, we got another body.

32:40.658 --> 32:42.002
It's a woman this time.

32:42.026 --> 32:43.003
Where?

32:43.027 --> 32:44.038
At the Institute.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.359
All right.

32:48.232 --> 32:50.811
Wait, when can I see
my daughter?

32:50.835 --> 32:52.496
Soon.

32:55.173 --> 32:58.152
A maintenance worker
from the Sattler Institute

32:58.176 --> 32:59.486
found the body.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.206
That'll spoil your Thanksgiving.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.693
Debra Dalton, boss.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.728
Fished her out of the culvert.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.330
Whoever put her down there
must've thought

33:09.354 --> 33:10.597
that the body would wash away.

33:10.621 --> 33:13.067
It's a pretty public place
for a murder.

33:13.091 --> 33:16.937
I mean, employees,
security guards...

33:16.961 --> 33:18.906
Dorms.

33:18.930 --> 33:21.364
Angela's room.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.427
"Lady in a Fountain."

33:31.776 --> 33:32.820
Can I help?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.221
Uh, I don't think so. Thank you.

33:34.245 --> 33:36.023
Can I watch TV?

33:36.047 --> 33:38.092
Uh, it's on the blink,
I'm afraid.

33:38.116 --> 33:40.361
Computer?

33:40.385 --> 33:42.945
Uh, that's my laptop,
and it's in my car.

33:43.988 --> 33:45.566
Books?

33:45.590 --> 33:47.034
Ah, yes. Uh, the library.

33:47.058 --> 33:50.050
Uh, second door on the left.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.707
Oh, just a moment, Ziva.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.442
We have to start the brining.

33:55.466 --> 33:56.710
Okay, Ducky, but I have to...

33:56.734 --> 33:57.845
No, no, no, no.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.413
It'll only take a moment.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.647
Ah, there we are.

34:00.671 --> 34:01.849
Now, then.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.550
You know the secret
to a good stuffing

34:03.574 --> 34:05.886
is not to get it too moist.

34:05.910 --> 34:08.155
Oh, this is a bit awkward.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.290
You know something? I think
we need a second pair of hands.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.193
Uh, uh, young lady?

34:13.217 --> 34:14.581
Angela?

34:16.754 --> 34:18.244
Angela?!

34:19.757 --> 34:21.725
Angela?

34:28.266 --> 34:30.257
Angela, where are you?

34:33.271 --> 34:36.866
She isn't in the library,
and she didn't go out back.

34:40.445 --> 34:43.123
Ziva? Ziva?

34:43.147 --> 34:44.824
Have you found her?

34:44.849 --> 34:47.010
She's gone. Call Gibbs.

35:06.066 --> 35:07.710
Agents are canvassing
the neighbors.

35:07.734 --> 35:09.011
AMBER Alert? BOLOs?

35:09.035 --> 35:10.012
No hits yet.

35:10.036 --> 35:11.514
Traffic cameras?

35:11.538 --> 35:14.207
D.O.T.'s are on full capacity
for the holidays, but checking.

35:15.442 --> 35:17.253
I looked everywhere.

35:17.277 --> 35:18.421
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

35:18.445 --> 35:20.089
You didn't hear anything?

35:20.113 --> 35:21.624
- Not car tires? Not voices?
- Nothing.

35:21.648 --> 35:23.726
By the time I came outside,
she was gone.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.194
It was all my fault.

35:25.218 --> 35:26.929
I was too busy preparing
for tomorrow.

35:26.953 --> 35:28.498
- No, it was my fault.
- I distracted you

35:28.522 --> 35:30.433
from doing your job.

35:30.457 --> 35:32.568
It's both of your faults.
Focus on fixing it.

35:32.592 --> 35:34.470
Yeah. McGee.

35:34.494 --> 35:35.638
I'll tell him.

35:35.662 --> 35:37.206
Krista Dalton's
in interrogation.

35:37.230 --> 35:39.070
You stay with Ducky.
You two, with me. Come on.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.479
Are you accusing me
of taking her?

35:43.503 --> 35:47.083
The care and safety of
those kids is my only concern.

35:47.107 --> 35:49.985
I can see why.

35:50.009 --> 35:52.188
Worth a lot to you.

35:52.212 --> 35:55.224
We did some digging, and we
found your overseas accounts.

35:55.248 --> 35:57.493
It's... It's not what you think.

35:57.517 --> 35:59.128
What am I thinking?

35:59.152 --> 36:01.397
Because it sure looks

36:01.421 --> 36:03.332
like you made money
selling government secrets,

36:03.356 --> 36:05.101
using these kids.

36:05.125 --> 36:06.402
They're games.

36:06.426 --> 36:07.803
Games?

36:07.827 --> 36:10.239
We sold battle scenarios
to game designers in China.

36:10.263 --> 36:12.541
Th-They paid a lot.

36:12.565 --> 36:14.143
- You and your sister Debra?
- Yes.

36:14.167 --> 36:17.113
Debra made contacts through
her trips to Asia for her firm.

36:17.137 --> 36:18.514
C-Ten Dynamics.

36:18.538 --> 36:21.050
We took some of the money...
Debra and I...

36:21.074 --> 36:22.918
the rest we gave
to the families.

36:22.942 --> 36:24.387
Sattler made a ton
off those kids,

36:24.411 --> 36:25.521
never gave anything back!

36:25.545 --> 36:28.324
It was old information...
useless!

36:28.348 --> 36:29.959
Frequency jamming signals?

36:29.983 --> 36:31.761
For Ballistic Winter... that
system was being phased out.

36:31.785 --> 36:33.028
It's still classified.

36:33.052 --> 36:34.463
Technically, but...

36:34.487 --> 36:36.819
Which makes it
technically treason.

36:38.792 --> 36:42.338
Someone murdered
Lance Corporal Lozada,

36:42.362 --> 36:44.940
and you're talking to me
about game sales?

36:44.964 --> 36:47.091
I had nothing to do
with his death!

36:51.905 --> 36:53.634
Oh, my God.

36:55.742 --> 36:59.178
That's... That's Debra.

37:01.214 --> 37:02.992
How did this...

37:03.016 --> 37:04.693
When did this happen?

37:04.717 --> 37:07.263
Found her today.

37:07.287 --> 37:08.464
Your day off.

37:08.488 --> 37:10.466
Two dead bodies.

37:10.490 --> 37:13.015
Both tied to you
and the Institute.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.839
You think...

37:16.863 --> 37:18.874
I killed my own sister?

37:18.898 --> 37:20.509
Maybe to bury the trail.

37:20.533 --> 37:21.935
Maybe to keep the money.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.547
Oh, my God.

37:24.571 --> 37:26.649
Angela is missing.
What does this dead Marine

37:26.673 --> 37:28.717
and your dead sister
have to do with her?

37:28.741 --> 37:30.553
- I don't know.
- Think!

37:30.577 --> 37:31.945
I swear! I...

37:34.047 --> 37:35.691
D-Debra was seeing someone.

37:35.715 --> 37:37.092
She was afraid of him.

37:37.116 --> 37:39.261
- She was going to break it off...
- Who? Give me a name!

37:39.285 --> 37:40.930
She never told me.
She didn't want me involved.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.856
You are involved!

37:48.394 --> 37:50.139
- 14 or more...
- DiNozzo.

37:50.163 --> 37:51.607
City and county agencies
have now...

37:51.631 --> 37:52.908
No sightings, boss.

37:52.932 --> 37:54.910
Whoever's got her
is keeping her out of sight.

37:54.934 --> 37:56.712
If anyone has seen her.

37:56.736 --> 37:58.581
I just borrowed these from Abby.

37:58.605 --> 37:59.582
I'm listening, Duck.

37:59.606 --> 38:01.083
Well, apart from the cat,

38:01.107 --> 38:03.886
everything in her room
is from the outside world.

38:03.910 --> 38:07.389
- Hey, hey, hey...
- The posters she's chosen, the photographs,

38:07.413 --> 38:09.458
the things she painted,
the things she's drawn.

38:09.482 --> 38:11.727
Yeah, there's nothing
of herself.

38:11.751 --> 38:13.996
It's as if she's resisting
showing the rest of the world

38:14.020 --> 38:15.030
what she really cares about.

38:15.054 --> 38:16.799
And when we talked,

38:16.823 --> 38:19.068
she never once
mentioned her home

38:19.092 --> 38:21.070
or the town
from whence she came.

38:21.094 --> 38:22.538
- She was guarding it.
- Yeah.

38:22.562 --> 38:24.974
Well, deep down,
I think she's just a scared

38:24.998 --> 38:27.409
- little girl trying to protect her mother.
- Ziva.

38:27.433 --> 38:29.478
I've been calling her mother's
house every ten minutes

38:29.502 --> 38:31.547
like you said, but no answer.

38:31.571 --> 38:33.082
I just got a credit card hit.

38:33.106 --> 38:34.950
One of Ducky's credit cards.

38:34.974 --> 38:35.951
What?

38:35.975 --> 38:37.953
She took one of mine?

38:37.977 --> 38:39.889
Clever girl.

38:39.913 --> 38:42.625
Just bought a map of her
hometown at a service station.

38:42.649 --> 38:44.760
She's dropping bread crumbs...
wants us to come get her.

38:44.784 --> 38:47.296
If the killer is thinking
the same way we are...

38:47.320 --> 38:49.288
He'll be waiting for her.
Let's go.

38:52.258 --> 38:54.970
Nice acceleration, boss.

38:54.994 --> 38:57.039
I don't think that
clam chowder was any good.

38:57.063 --> 38:59.041
I... I haven't felt this way

38:59.065 --> 39:01.501
since Aunt Lorraine's
Thanksgiving, back in '86.

39:02.502 --> 39:03.479
Yeah, Abbs.

39:03.503 --> 39:04.680
Gibbs.

39:04.704 --> 39:06.382
Ducky said you were looking
for a connection

39:06.406 --> 39:07.516
between Lance Corporal Lozada

39:07.540 --> 39:09.018
and the woman found
in the culvert.

39:09.042 --> 39:10.185
Talk faster, Abbs.
You're breaking up.

39:10.209 --> 39:11.420
Okay.

39:11.444 --> 39:14.523
I found traces of beeswax
and bleached linseed oil

39:14.547 --> 39:16.025
on both Lance Corporal
Lozada's body

39:16.049 --> 39:18.627
and a thumb impression on
the back of Debra Dalton's head.

39:18.651 --> 39:20.663
It's like she was
held down and drowned.

39:20.687 --> 39:23.265
We matched the water in her
lungs to the fountain in front

39:23.289 --> 39:24.433
of the think tank building.

39:24.457 --> 39:26.001
Exact chlorine
and alkali levels.

39:26.025 --> 39:27.503
Both the oil and the wax
are used

39:27.527 --> 39:28.971
as base ingredients
in oil-based paints.

39:28.995 --> 39:30.272
Thanks, Abbs.

39:30.296 --> 39:33.008
DiNozzo...

39:33.032 --> 39:34.910
Uh, nausea sort of comes
in waves, boss.

39:34.934 --> 39:36.845
But I'm working through it.

39:36.869 --> 39:38.647
The paintings at Norvell's
workstation at the Institute.

39:38.671 --> 39:39.848
They oil- or water-based?

39:39.872 --> 39:41.183
Oil.

39:41.207 --> 39:42.985
Uh, landscape, fruit bowls...

39:43.009 --> 39:46.001
Oh, I really shouldn't
have had that clam chowder.

39:55.054 --> 39:56.498
I'll take the back.

39:56.522 --> 39:58.391
Hang on.

40:03.363 --> 40:05.975
Mom! Mom!

40:05.999 --> 40:07.330
Baby, run.

40:08.368 --> 40:10.512
Run, please.

40:10.536 --> 40:13.449
It's going to be okay, Mom.

40:13.473 --> 40:15.484
Why are you doing this to us?

40:15.508 --> 40:17.486
Tell her, Angela.

40:17.510 --> 40:19.989
Tell her what you told
Lance Corporal Lozada.

40:20.013 --> 40:22.224
What you wrote in your collages!

40:22.248 --> 40:24.193
- Angela, go, please. Just let her go!
- Shut up!

40:24.217 --> 40:25.707
Why'd you kill that woman?

40:26.753 --> 40:29.264
She humiliated me.

40:29.288 --> 40:32.034
It had to be done.

40:32.058 --> 40:34.003
Same thing with Lozada,

40:34.027 --> 40:36.672
- once you told him.
- No! No! No.

40:36.696 --> 40:38.540
I think they bought the whole
gang retribution thing.

40:38.564 --> 40:40.589
Don't you?

40:42.702 --> 40:44.046
Time to take a little ride.

40:44.070 --> 40:45.070
Let's go.

40:47.273 --> 40:48.501
Move.

40:52.445 --> 40:53.878
Let her go.

40:56.282 --> 40:58.807
Back off!

41:00.420 --> 41:02.047
I'll kill her!

41:09.462 --> 41:12.741
Angela... look at me.

41:12.765 --> 41:14.977
Move back! Now!

41:15.001 --> 41:17.112
Ziva.

41:17.136 --> 41:18.247
Got it.

41:18.271 --> 41:20.501
She'll miss.

41:21.507 --> 41:24.442
What's the probability of that?

41:26.479 --> 41:28.590
Based on the temperature
and humidity...

41:28.614 --> 41:32.127
no wind, half moon, good light...

41:32.151 --> 41:34.210
97.6%.

41:35.688 --> 41:37.833
Last chance, Norvell.

41:37.857 --> 41:40.602
Move or I'll do it.

41:40.626 --> 41:42.161
Take it.

41:44.030 --> 41:45.007
Mom...

41:45.031 --> 41:46.442
Oh, baby.

41:46.466 --> 41:48.744
Oh... Oh, baby. It's okay.

41:48.768 --> 41:51.202
Love you.

41:52.939 --> 41:54.804
It's okay.

41:59.846 --> 42:01.557
Oh, Ducky.

42:01.581 --> 42:02.991
- Yay! Yay.
- It is such a pleasure

42:03.015 --> 42:05.928
to have you all here.

42:05.952 --> 42:09.932
Even though our togetherness
was not your first choice.

42:09.956 --> 42:11.934
Ah, it's just Indian poker,

42:11.958 --> 42:13.802
all-you-can-eat crab legs,

42:13.826 --> 42:14.803
showgirls.

42:14.827 --> 42:15.804
Relax, Tony.

42:15.828 --> 42:17.339
Plenty of wine.

42:17.363 --> 42:20.042
Well, then...

42:20.066 --> 42:22.010
I suppose it's time to carve.

42:22.034 --> 42:24.229
And, apparently,
we have a quorum.

42:31.410 --> 42:32.879
Jethro!

42:33.946 --> 42:35.224
Yay.

42:35.248 --> 42:36.725
You remembered the rolls.

42:36.749 --> 42:39.128
There's not a lot available
out there, Duck.

42:43.256 --> 42:45.952
A superb selection.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.337
A toast.

42:48.361 --> 42:51.240
Close friends
and dear family all,

42:51.264 --> 42:54.893
a bountiful thanks
and good things for fall.

42:56.269 --> 42:57.861
And to all a good night.

42:58.604 --> 43:00.516
Wrong holiday.

43:01.874 --> 43:03.185
Cheers.

43:03.209 --> 43:04.520
- To all of us.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

43:04.544 --> 43:05.738
- Cheers.
- Jolly good.
