For 100,000 years,
our civilization flourished...

46:18.000 --> 46:20.002
...accomplishing wonders.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.810
What happened?

46:24.800 --> 46:27.883
Artificial population control
was established.

46:28.560 --> 46:32.201
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.371
We exhausted our natural resources.

46:35.640 --> 46:39.645
As a result,
our planet's core became unstable.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.651
Eventually, our military leader...

46:44.880 --> 46:48.771
...General Zod, attempted a coup.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.882
But by then it was too late.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.766
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity...

46:57.040 --> 46:59.805
...and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.524
<i>This is a genesis chamber.</i>

47:04.400 --> 47:07.529
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

47:07.800 --> 47:11.486
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pre-determined role in our society...

47:11.760 --> 47:12.568
...as a worker...

47:12.840 --> 47:15.969
...a warrior, a leader and so on.

47:16.200 --> 47:19.488
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.927
The element of choice, of chance.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.602
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

47:24.840 --> 47:27.366
...other than what society
had intended for him or her?

47:28.880 --> 47:31.486
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

47:32.280 --> 47:34.282
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

47:34.520 --> 47:36.966
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.771
That's why we risked so much to save you.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.331
Why didn't you come with me?

47:46.880 --> 47:48.609
We couldn't, Kal.

47:49.640 --> 47:50.641
No matter how much...

47:50.920 --> 47:52.126
...we wanted to.

47:52.600 --> 47:54.648
No matter how much we loved you.

47:55.360 --> 47:56.771
Your mother, Lara, and I...

47:57.000 --> 48:00.129
...were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was...

48:00.360 --> 48:02.044
...tied to its fate.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.328
- So I'm alone.
- No.

48:06.080 --> 48:09.766
You're as much a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.209
You can embody the best of both worlds.

48:13.440 --> 48:17.081
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

48:21.600 --> 48:24.570
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

48:24.800 --> 48:27.724
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.401
They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.608
Not if you guide them, Kal.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.248
Not if you give them hope.

48:39.680 --> 48:41.842
That's what this symbol means.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.881
The symbol of the house of EI
means hope.

48:45.120 --> 48:47.646
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

48:47.880 --> 48:51.805
...in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.
