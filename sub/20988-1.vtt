00:33.567 --> 00:36.502
This is, uh, a poem that was...

00:37.805 --> 00:40.806
uh, I found it in the library.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.775
It's for my son.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.146
"To a child dancing in the wind.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.651
"Dance there upon the shore.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.586
"What need have you to care...

00:54.588 --> 00:56.588
"For wind or waters roar?

00:56.590 --> 00:59.324
"Tumble out your hair.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.160
"That the salt drops have wet;

01:03.364 --> 01:07.066
"What need have you to dread the
monstrous crying of the wind?"

01:50.478 --> 01:52.878
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.869
Excuse me.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.304
James? James?

02:19.306 --> 02:21.140
James! James! Come here.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.144
Stay close, okay?

02:25.146 --> 02:27.312
Give me your hand. Tight.
Hold it tight.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.159
Sorry. Sorry.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.924
I'm sorry. Where are they?

02:57.211 --> 02:59.745
Listen, frank. You look after yourself.
All right?

02:59.747 --> 03:02.181
Angela, this way.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.344
Sorry. Excuse me.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.920
There she goes, boys.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.462
Look at that.
Is that fantastic?

03:23.270 --> 03:25.804
Rob! Mum. There you are.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.307
- Hello.
- Thought I was going to Miss it.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.278
Where's grandpa? I don't know.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.721
Pappy won't be coming.
He's not here.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.940
Come on, frank.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.982
You're missing it, frank.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.851
You coming out? I'll be
out in a minute, danny.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.195
How can they let someone else build our navy ships?
It's just the way it is.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.649
And you?
How can they let you go?

04:45.919 --> 04:48.754
You want this? No, thanks.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.811
All right, gus?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.351
You all right?

05:43.744 --> 05:46.044
Joan redmond? Yeah. I'm sorry.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.647
Excuse me. Sorry.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.616
Excuse me. Sorry.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.056
Sorry. Right.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.893
As I was saying, driving a bus is
exactly the same as driving a car,

06:01.895 --> 06:05.097
except for the 50 or so backseat
drivers sitting behind you.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.819
Rob brought the boys
for your last day.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.725
They were looking for you.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.795
Gus fuller lost his hand today.

06:36.797 --> 06:40.832
Oh? How?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.734
One of the presses.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.109
Will he get more money?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.447
I watched him do it.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.134
That's you... tidy.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.710
See you soon, love.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.269
Hello. Hi.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.605
J.SA., pensions or disability?

08:26.607 --> 08:28.707
I'm looking for a job.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.610
First time? Yeah.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.511
You'll need to speak
to someone.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.679
Let's see who's free.

08:52.266 --> 08:55.534
- Angela.
- All right?

08:55.536 --> 08:58.036
Okay.

09:20.093 --> 09:23.628
Look, frank, you don't have
to fill it in here.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.630
You can do it at home.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.174
Won't be the same at work
without frank.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.776
You got the boot as well,
you dozy pillock.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.346
He might have a heart attack.
That happens, doesn't it?

10:14.348 --> 10:16.748
Work monday, redundant tuesday,

10:16.750 --> 10:19.618
heart attack wednesday.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.254
Well, frank'll be all right then.
Today's thursday.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.625
What in the name of total
insanity are you wearing?

10:26.627 --> 10:29.628
Oh! I need clean ones.

10:29.630 --> 10:33.131
- Tell me they're not your mother's.
- Don't be daft.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.800
They're big janine's. She left
'em in the pub again on friday.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.037
- Don't let frank catch you wearing 'em.
- I knew they'd come in handy.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.906
- For what, exactly?
- What if I get run over?

10:44.711 --> 10:47.712
Frank won't be coming
swimming tonight.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.181
I'm glad I got out of there when I did.
It's turned nasty.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.751
Frank could have stayed on like I did.
The men respect him.

10:52.753 --> 10:56.154
All he had to do was let them upstairs
think they were runnin' the job.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.289
Man's too pigheaded
for his own good.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.607
- Frank, I didn't mean...
- Leave it, eddie.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.911
See you in the pool then.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.996
Frank?

12:16.203 --> 12:18.403
Frank?

12:20.307 --> 12:24.109
- Frank?
- Frank?

12:24.111 --> 12:28.213
Frank, where are you going?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.415
- Frank.
- - Oh, my god.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.383
Here, man. Here.

12:34.888 --> 12:38.523
- Get an ambulance, joan. Get an ambulance.
- Please, no!

12:38.525 --> 12:41.805
- You're all right, man. You're all right.
- Get out of my way!

12:47.534 --> 12:50.301
It's okay. He's okay.
Dad's fine.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.037
It was a panic attack.
That's what the doctor said.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.340
What? A panic attack.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.509
Only don't mention it
when he comes out.

12:57.511 --> 13:00.011
Okay, let's go.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.113
Eddie rang me.
Eddie's got a big mouth.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.849
- He was worried.
- I slipped, okay?

13:04.851 --> 13:07.218
- Can I get money for a can of coke?
- You collapsed.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.087
No, we're not allowed. -Mum
says you had a panic attack.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.289
I slipped and fell.
It happens, okay?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.925
What are you asking for? Sorry. -Have
you got money for a can of coke?

13:13.927 --> 13:16.427
No. No. I don't have any money.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.963
Do you have your purse?
No, I don't have my purse.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.498
Right. Ask your dad for the money.
How do I get out of here?

13:20.500 --> 13:23.001
Down there. Where? Right, left?
Where?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.335
That way, frank. Right.
I'll find it.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.038
I'm sorry, love.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.841
Come on, boys, let's go.

13:29.843 --> 13:33.845
What's the matter with you?
You shouldn't...

13:33.847 --> 13:36.488
you could have said hello. You
should not have told him.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.255
Hands.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.601
Is pappy all right?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.871
Of course he is.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.879
Do you like pappy?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.961
Pappy and I are just different.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.951
Pappy doesn't like you.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.533
Oh, look who it is.
Frank's little girl.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.139
Got our fish suppers
ready yet, chinaman?

14:35.141 --> 14:39.944
Oh, god love us. He's a real
chatterbox tonight, isn't he?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.315
Tell you what...
I've changed my mind.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.351
I fancy a curry.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.929
See you tuesday.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.107
Just a bag of chips,
please, chan.

15:10.944 --> 15:14.445
Heard about your dad.
I'm, uh, sorry.

15:24.958 --> 15:29.060
Okay, chan? Frank. All right?

15:29.062 --> 15:31.462
Good book?

15:31.464 --> 15:34.699
It's for my wife.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.935
It's about cooking.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.638
What are you looking for?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.475
Don't know.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.180
But whatever it is,
it's not in here.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.292
He doesn't know what to do
with himself anymore.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.962
More than I can say for you, driving a bus.
Have you told him yet?

16:03.964 --> 16:06.631
No. Don't want to give him
anything else to worry about.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.701
He's gonna find out
sooner or later.

16:09.703 --> 16:13.004
He's shut me out again,
michelle, like when stuart...

16:13.006 --> 16:16.107
it won't last long. Are things
better with him and rob?

16:16.109 --> 16:18.309
Not really.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.288
Hey. Hiya.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.557
- Bag of chips, please.
- Okay.

16:36.429 --> 16:40.031
- Is your dad around?
- No.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.766
Salt and vinegar?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.203
Please.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.490
Oh! Hi, frank. Come on in.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.059
I'm just off to work.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.194
Tom cruise
is in the front room.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.763
Eddie, it's frank.
He's got chips.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.541
Our industrious little beetle
is about to meet someone...

17:24.544 --> 17:27.345
Altogether more...
I've seen this before.

17:27.347 --> 17:31.049
Let's call him...
that wee beetle...

17:31.051 --> 17:36.320
Pushes that big ball of shite for what
is the equivalent of six miles for him.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.322
Then, just as he gets
to where he's going,

17:39.559 --> 17:42.193
another beetle comes...

17:42.195 --> 17:44.495
And steals it
from under his nose.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.731
It's what happens.
Wait, you'll see.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.800
Six miles.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.202
Poor bastard.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.771
They'll have you shoveling shit.
You know that?

17:56.476 --> 17:57.196
I know.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.215
You still coming on the
booze cruise to france?

18:04.217 --> 18:06.751
It'll do us good.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.454
I can see myself
on the ship now...

18:09.456 --> 18:11.622
captain eddie fraser.

18:11.624 --> 18:17.361
Beer in hand, and the
sea air in my lungs.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.631
Oh, eddie, that seagull's
eating your puke.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.471
He caught it in the air. That
seagull caught it in the air.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.574
Puke again, eddie.
Go on, puke again.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.247
Brilliant, that.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.898
All right?

18:56.569 --> 18:59.837
Bloody hell.
You can see france already.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.739
Isn't very far, is it?

19:01.741 --> 19:04.208
Near enough to swim.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.210
I wish I had.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.339
Frank?

19:35.341 --> 19:37.375
Frank?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.811
You all right?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.451
How mad would you
have to be to swim this?

19:47.453 --> 19:49.554
Totally.

19:58.198 --> 20:02.333
How far is it to france? We're
in france, you dipstick.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.369
Yeah, I know we're in france,
but how far is it from britain?

20:05.371 --> 20:09.707
Twenty miles, give or take
the odd oil tanker.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.976
Twenty miles, eh?
How do they measure that?

20:11.978 --> 20:13.744
They look very small
from here, don't they?

20:13.746 --> 20:16.347
They are very small, love.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.583
It's just us women like to
shrink when we get near them.

20:18.585 --> 20:22.987
You can't swim across one of the busiest
shipping routes 'cause the fancy takes you.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.290
Who'd you show your passport to?
Punch and judy?

20:26.292 --> 20:29.760
The deck chair man. -I was
a deck chair man for a day.

20:29.762 --> 20:34.532
- Only a day?
- Wasn't what I was expecting.

20:34.534 --> 20:38.803
Did you tell him? No. God, no.

20:38.805 --> 20:42.974
I will. He won't like it. He'll think
it's to do with him losing his job.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.910
And he'll like it even less
when he finds out the truth...

20:47.981 --> 20:51.301
that it's got absolutely
nothing to do with him at all.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.002
Sorry to pull you back
to the yard like this, frank.

21:11.004 --> 21:13.838
It's a small, little matter.
I just need to prove something.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.407
I know you must be busy.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.844
You know these guys, frank.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.581
So? I've told you...

21:23.583 --> 21:26.484
I didn't see anything.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.519
He must have been desperate.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.888
He's going to get nothing.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.424
He used the wrong hand.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.560
He's right-handed.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.464
Duncan?

21:42.835 --> 21:46.304
He crossed hands
to operate the press.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.809
Okay.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.883
You should have been more
loyal to the company, frank.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.952
You wouldn't know
what loyalty is.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.488
Loyalty is a full wage packet
at the end of the week.

22:05.792 --> 22:09.060
Loyalty is being valued.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.062
Being happy with yourself.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.532
You happy with yourself, frank?

22:16.836 --> 22:20.538
Who do you think you are?

22:20.540 --> 22:24.542
You seriously think you can intimidate
people into being loyal to you?

22:26.979 --> 22:30.014
There's not a man in this yard would
piss on you if you were on fire.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.092
Hi, frank. Can't keep away, eh?

23:51.197 --> 23:53.998
I knocked a vase over.
Which one?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.966
The one with the crack in it?

23:55.968 --> 23:57.802
No, the other one.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.439
Will it fix?

24:07.213 --> 24:09.547
I need to go and get changed.

24:16.522 --> 24:19.123
So what if you swam the clyde?
It doesn't prove anything.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.091
Channel's a completely
different thing.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.594
Think you could then, frank?

24:23.596 --> 24:25.529
- I know I could.
- Look.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.832
You got made redundant.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.000
You should just face up to it,
like everyone else.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.084
Face up to it?

24:52.525 --> 24:54.124
Like you did, eddie?

25:15.548 --> 25:18.782
That's a lot of reading.
That's a lot of swimming.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.985
You think I'm wasting my time?

25:20.987 --> 25:23.087
"A gem cannot be polished
without friction,

25:23.089 --> 25:25.789
nor a man perfected
without trials."

25:27.660 --> 25:30.094
Is that a yes or a no?

25:30.096 --> 25:31.896
When do we start?

25:51.951 --> 25:54.184
Hey, hey, hey.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.687
What have we forgotten?

25:59.859 --> 26:03.060
What's this?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.829
You know you're not allowed.
In you go.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.766
I'll see you at 3:30.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.267
Bye. Bye!

26:22.882 --> 26:26.584
- Hiya, son.
- Dad.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.886
Okay?

26:28.888 --> 26:31.589
You?

26:31.591 --> 26:35.092
- Yeah, good.
- Busy?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.628
Aye.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.767
You used to have one of them.
Remember?

26:43.769 --> 26:46.136
Yeah.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.178
They had one each,
but they're always losing them.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.712
I was going to go for a coffee.
Wanna come?

26:54.714 --> 26:58.782
I'd better not. Got to get on.
Maybe next time.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.087
Aye.

27:22.208 --> 27:25.075
Promised michelle
I'd fix this for her.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.711
Just wanted to see
what was inside.

27:27.713 --> 27:30.047
Now it doesn't seem to want
to go back together.

27:30.049 --> 27:33.017
Things aren't meant
to be fixed nowadays.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.285
No.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.322
Not by you anyway.

27:44.397 --> 27:46.330
How's work?

27:51.070 --> 27:54.672
What was it sausage finger said today?
Something funny.

27:59.679 --> 28:02.379
No, I can't remember. It was
funny anyway, whatever it was.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.716
The thing that he said,
it was funny.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.687
I'm gonna swim it, ed.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.793
I know you are.

28:38.017 --> 28:41.051
Oh, my, that's a lot of reading.
It's a lot of swimming.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.254
Probably mentions sharks.
Does it mention sharks, frank?

28:44.256 --> 28:47.157
- There's no sharks in the channel.
- This one shark...

28:47.159 --> 28:49.893
when they opened it up, they found a
portable telly and a box of condoms.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.229
- They did not.
- Don't tell me the telly was still on.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.265
Look. It's important they take
this seriously and do it properly,

28:55.267 --> 28:57.868
or you may as well not bother.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.737
Bloody hell. Bugger me.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.773
Are you coming,
or are you going?

29:02.775 --> 29:06.310
Sorry, frank.

29:06.312 --> 29:09.780
To start with,
there's the training schedule.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.916
I don't mean to be rude, chan... -A list
of things we need to do to set the swim up.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.019
But I didn't think you could speak english.
I didn't think you could speak.

29:16.021 --> 29:20.290
Danny. First, we need
to register the swim.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.894
I've only ever heard you say about three words,
and two of them were "salt" and "vinegar."

29:23.896 --> 29:27.131
For the love of god,
will you let the man speak?

29:27.133 --> 29:31.101
Sorry, chan. Next we have to get
a boat and an experienced pilot.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.971
How about merv?
He's got a boat.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.507
Merv the perv's got a boat?

29:36.509 --> 29:39.309
It's one of them daft, pointy ones.
It's all chrome and shiny plastic.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.079
No, I don't want to talk to merv.
It's got a dinky, wee bar.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.401
Does it go fast though?
Like shit off a stick.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.100
Two years...
that's what it takes.

30:03.102 --> 30:06.470
I want to do it in six months.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.071
Will you have time to help me?

30:08.073 --> 30:10.974
Aye.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.213
Ed, I would have asked you, but I
didn't think you would have the time.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.016
Aye. Well...

30:19.018 --> 30:22.219
chan is probably better at this
sort of thing than me anyway.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.227
Look, guys, uh... do me a favor, and
can we just keep this to ourselves?

30:30.229 --> 30:32.596
Sure. Aye.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.901
Is he in? Aye. He's
in the kitchen.

30:37.903 --> 30:40.003
Right.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.684
Good evening, joan.
Hello, norman.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.317
I've got a cake. Oh. Very nice.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.159
Hello, Mrs. Redmond. Hello.

31:02.161 --> 31:05.929
It's danny. Danny campbell.
Ah. Right.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.498
You want frank?
He's in the kitchen.

31:15.941 --> 31:18.308
Come in.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.210
He's in the kitchen.

32:27.446 --> 32:31.348
Keep your eyes open, james.
In here.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.618
On you go.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.321
All right, rob? Hey, danny.
How's things?

32:37.323 --> 32:40.190
Aw, not bad. Skint.
No job, no girlfriend.

32:40.192 --> 32:43.126
And I've been wearing big janine's
knickers since last february.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.696
I can't complain.
It's not easy, that...

32:45.698 --> 32:47.597
doing a woman's job.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.733
Here, I'll leave you to it.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.069
Rather you than me.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.404
You okay? Yeah.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.640
Leave it alone, you big numpty.

32:56.642 --> 33:00.444
And try to stay on your feet.

33:00.446 --> 33:04.181
I saw dad down the pool again.
What's he up to? Swimming.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.615
It seems he's there all the time.
It does him good.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.618
Away you go.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.154
How did they both manage
to fall over?

33:11.156 --> 33:14.091
Practice.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.226
Can we go up to our room?
Yes, you can.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.996
I didn't know you had this.

33:20.065 --> 33:23.266
Angela dug it out.

33:23.268 --> 33:26.436
It's a good sand boat.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.573
That's all you ever wanted to make, both of you.
Must be in your blood.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.475
Biscuit?

33:33.512 --> 33:36.279
- I go up there now and then.
- Hmm. I know.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.162
Mum?

33:55.401 --> 33:57.768
I failed my bus test.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.044
That's not bad.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.713
Time's faster and you're getting
more distance from the strokes.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.248
But it's still a long way
from the real thing.

34:15.286 --> 34:18.255
You'd be better
at bus driving than me.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.757
I thought about it.
Kept seeing those ads.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.326
So, why didn't you tell us?

34:25.697 --> 34:27.563
There's no sugar in this.

34:30.101 --> 34:33.136
Can you take it again?
You get three goes.

34:33.138 --> 34:36.473
You should try for it.
You'd be good.

34:36.475 --> 34:39.775
What, and have angela give up work?
She earns twice what I could.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.079
I've said before,
I can help with the twins.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.246
And I've said before,
they're my kids.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.089
If I'm not prepared to look after them,
then we shouldn't have had them.

34:48.454 --> 34:51.121
What? You're like your dad.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.836
You wait right here
at this side of the pool.

35:05.838 --> 35:08.705
Right, go beside campbell.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.308
Good boy.

35:11.310 --> 35:14.750
Aaron, when you get to the side
of the pool, just stop and wait.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.547
Whoop.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.586
Hold on, jonathan.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.870
- You okay? You okay?
- He's all right. He's all right.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.705
I'm all right. It's the way he swims.
It's okay.

35:41.707 --> 35:44.841
Just leave him.
Thank you. Thank you.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.589
Yes!

35:59.591 --> 36:02.792
- Yes!
- Did you see that, big man?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.555
You call that swimming?

36:31.557 --> 36:33.456
Aye.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.462
Have you got a name?

36:39.464 --> 36:41.498
Aaron.

36:43.202 --> 36:45.769
Good name.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.671
Good swimmer.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.445
Rob, hurry up.

37:07.659 --> 37:11.228
Come on, let's go.
He's probably not here.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.830
You said he comes down here all the time.
Unless you don't want to.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.799
No, I'm coming. And I didn't
say, "all of the time."

37:15.801 --> 37:17.934
I said, "some of the time,"
Smart-arse.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.936
Where are you going to?
All right, frank?

37:19.938 --> 37:22.472
All right, danny.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.755
Who's that?
I used to work with him.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.959
Okay. Okay.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.603
Who's gonna be first?
No cheating.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.506
You got a head start.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.441
Ah, my toe. I stubbed my toe.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.510
Who won the race? You.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.583
- Whose clothes are who here?
- Anyone else in here?

38:06.585 --> 38:09.653
No, no. You're safe.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.856
Will you come out of there?
Why are you hiding in there?

38:11.857 --> 38:15.825
You've got the shampoo?
Oh, have I?

38:15.827 --> 38:19.396
Why do men's changing rooms always
smell of P-i-s-s? You're lucky.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.364
Normally they smell of S-h-i-t.

38:21.366 --> 38:23.500
What does that spell?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.740
All right, clothes on.
Who's first?

38:30.742 --> 38:32.842
Come on. Let's get dressed.
T-shirt.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.378
You're cold. You're freezing.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.642
See you monday.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.577
Excuse me.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.415
See you monday.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.690
Just the three. Danny.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.428
Get his change right, shirley.
He'll be watching the pennies.

39:59.831 --> 40:03.099
It's not even may. You can't go
swimming outdoors this time of year.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.935
I've got to get colder. I'm
going to loch lomond tomorrow.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.438
There's frost forecast tonight.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.573
I think we should all do it.
Lend a bit of morale.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.776
I'll do it. Sounds like a laugh.
What about you, eddie?

40:12.778 --> 40:15.812
Oh, yeah, yeah. Count me in. Not me.
I support much better when I'm dry.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.947
I'm more your dry kind of supporter.
Nice cake, norman.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.716
Yeah, less salt this time.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.424
Here we go!

40:32.564 --> 40:35.465
Oh, eddie, where are you going?

40:35.467 --> 40:37.467
No. Oh, no. Eddie, come on.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.536
No. Get off me.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.641
Oh! Oh! I've got piles!

40:49.514 --> 40:51.514
Hold on, frank!

40:51.516 --> 40:53.616
I'll be right with you!

40:58.523 --> 41:00.590
Don't worry, son.
It'll grow back.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.992
It better had.
I'm playing football later on.

41:02.994 --> 41:06.195
Here we go, lads. Nice
cold beers to warm you up.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.798
- Hey, salange.
- - Salange.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.002
The fire of the crucible.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.705
God. What is the "fire of the crucible"?
A chinese proverb.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.541
From now on you have to
train in the cold.

41:18.543 --> 41:21.511
Not only that, you have to swim
25 miles a week, six days a week.

41:21.513 --> 41:24.113
Here. I've got one
for you, chan.

41:24.115 --> 41:27.155
Man who walks through airport turnstile
sideways is going to bangkok.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.925
How do you know
he's going to bangkok?

41:35.927 --> 41:37.760
Bang cock.

41:37.762 --> 41:41.164
Bang cock.

41:41.166 --> 41:45.134
Listen. We still need
to get ahold of a boat...

41:45.136 --> 41:49.038
- so we can support frank in the water.
- Merv the perv's got a boat.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.241
- But do you think he'd let us have a go on it?
- I don't see why not.

41:51.243 --> 41:53.610
He'd let you have a go
with his wife.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.079
Bang cock. Bang cock.

42:10.128 --> 42:12.262
Oh, no, I can't.

42:12.264 --> 42:14.564
I thought I could, but I can't.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.766
- I'll see you at the bus stop.
- Hey!

42:16.768 --> 42:19.302
Hey, over here. Come on.

42:22.274 --> 42:25.642
Don't be shy. Give it a try.

42:25.644 --> 42:27.710
Merv, it's frank.

42:27.712 --> 42:30.613
Can I have a word?

42:30.615 --> 42:34.083
Hiya, frank.
Hey, vera, it's frank.

42:34.085 --> 42:36.185
Hi, vera.

42:36.187 --> 42:40.757
How's joan? Joan's... she's... she's fine.
She's... yeah.

42:40.759 --> 42:44.093
She's still after joan's
recipe for lemon cheesecake.

42:44.095 --> 42:47.130
I'll remind her.

42:47.132 --> 42:50.266
Listen. I'm sorry.
Is this a bad time?

42:50.268 --> 42:53.708
- 'Cause, I mean, I could come back later.
- No, it's great, frank.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.739
Norman says you've got a boat.

42:56.741 --> 42:59.976
I was wondering
if maybe we could borrow it.

42:59.978 --> 43:02.779
I want to shag it!

43:02.781 --> 43:06.249
- Merv probably has.
- You sure you know what you're doing?

43:06.251 --> 43:09.819
Of course I do. I used
to be in the sea cadets.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.888
Bit different to a leaky canoe
on the clyde, this.

43:11.890 --> 43:14.624
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

43:14.626 --> 43:18.695
- Yeah, well, just make sure you are.
- Are you not coming, norman?

43:18.697 --> 43:22.298
Get on there with the missing link at the helm?
You're joking, aren't you?

43:22.300 --> 43:26.769
No. Uh, I'll leave it till I find my sea legs.
Next time maybe.

43:28.173 --> 43:31.007
Help! Slow down!

43:34.779 --> 43:36.613
Right then.

43:43.054 --> 43:46.356
- Aw, you flooded it.
- I'll fix it. Just give us a minute.

43:46.358 --> 43:49.826
Norman! Help!

43:49.828 --> 43:52.662
Norman!

43:56.368 --> 43:59.168
Oh!

43:59.170 --> 44:01.304
Oh, shite!

44:12.851 --> 44:14.917
Oh, sh...

44:41.346 --> 44:43.413
Keep your eye on that,
will you?

44:48.687 --> 44:51.754
What's on your mind, son?

44:51.756 --> 44:53.557
I've been thinking. What with?

44:54.726 --> 44:56.993
I was thinking...

44:56.995 --> 44:58.795
I could have a go
at the channel too.

44:58.797 --> 45:00.863
Yeah? Yeah.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.232
What do you think?

45:03.234 --> 45:05.201
You think you're up to it?

45:05.203 --> 45:07.437
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

45:07.439 --> 45:09.839
Yeah? Definitely.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.819
All right, rob?

45:22.821 --> 45:26.456
Evening, janine.

45:26.458 --> 45:28.991
Pint of lager, please, eight packets
of crisps... assorted flavors...

45:28.993 --> 45:31.194
no prawn cocktail,
two pork pies,

45:31.196 --> 45:33.796
three ham sandwiches
and a pint of guinness, please.

45:33.798 --> 45:36.799
I'm in training... swimming.

45:36.801 --> 45:39.268
- I've got to bulk up.
- You're swimming?

45:39.270 --> 45:42.371
Training, but I'm getting
mentally prepared.

45:42.373 --> 45:45.274
I'm in mental training.

45:45.276 --> 45:47.143
So how's things with you then?

45:47.145 --> 45:49.312
The same.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.380
How's the big fella?

45:51.382 --> 45:55.051
What? Your little boy.

45:55.053 --> 45:57.053
He fell on his arse the last
time I saw you. Oh, yeah.

45:57.055 --> 45:59.989
He's all right.
He does it all the time.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.958
He bounces back quick enough.
Oh, yeah.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.127
They're very bouncy... kids.

46:04.129 --> 46:07.797
Like balls... Or castles.

46:07.799 --> 46:10.099
Still, it's gotta be the most
difficult job in the world, that,

46:10.101 --> 46:12.201
being a dad.

46:12.203 --> 46:15.271
Probably why mine left us.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.313
But you don't Miss
what you never had, do you?

46:21.446 --> 46:24.080
Make sure you stay
in front of him, frank.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.882
If the water suddenly
gets warm,

46:25.884 --> 46:28.384
that'll be danny.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.419
How many of those
have you eaten?

46:30.421 --> 46:32.522
Oh, just the one.
Well, get rid of it.

46:35.827 --> 46:38.261
Right, okay.
Don't do anything stupid.

46:38.263 --> 46:40.096
If you get into trouble,
what do you do?

46:40.098 --> 46:42.799
Go to the boat. Yeah?

46:42.801 --> 46:45.268
All right. Now, remember,
we're not superheroes.

46:45.270 --> 46:47.270
I hear you. I'm good.
Okay, let's go.

46:47.272 --> 46:49.438
What's that?

46:49.440 --> 46:52.441
Jellyfish.

46:52.443 --> 46:54.684
They're fine. They're fine.

46:57.315 --> 47:00.149
Come on!

47:00.151 --> 47:03.252
Oh! Oh! Oh!

47:03.254 --> 47:05.288
Colder than last time.
Danny, slow down.

47:05.290 --> 47:08.558
Come on! Here we go!
Danny. Hey, danny.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.027
Watch this. Pace yourself.

47:34.919 --> 47:38.054
You are king of the jungle.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.625
I'm a lion.

47:42.627 --> 47:45.027
Now repeat after me...

48:00.645 --> 48:05.147
Right. Here you go, frank.

48:05.149 --> 48:07.583
Why can't they just hold
on to the boat and get it?

48:07.585 --> 48:10.052
Frank wants to do it right.

48:10.054 --> 48:12.054
If they touch the boat,
the swim won't count.

48:42.921 --> 48:45.388
Eddie!

48:45.390 --> 48:48.291
He's got cramps! Start the boat, chan!
Start the boat!

48:48.293 --> 48:52.461
- Danny! Danny, hold on!
- Danny!

48:52.463 --> 48:54.530
Hold on, danny!

48:56.434 --> 48:58.134
It won't start.

49:05.944 --> 49:09.578
It's okay. Calm down.
Take it easy.

49:40.511 --> 49:43.479
- What did the doctor say?
- It's fine.

49:43.481 --> 49:46.682
The doctor says he's gonna be all right.
No thanks to you.

49:46.684 --> 49:49.051
He looks to you like a dad.

49:49.053 --> 49:52.121
You should have stopped him.

49:52.123 --> 49:56.025
It wasn't frank's fault, ma. I will
not have him go in the water again.

49:56.027 --> 49:58.327
Ma, it was my own fault.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.135
I just wanted to be
the man for once.

50:08.406 --> 50:11.440
Olympic superstar.
Nike sponsorship.

50:11.442 --> 50:13.542
Just be the man, you know?

50:15.780 --> 50:17.680
Like you.

50:22.253 --> 50:26.155
I didn't want you
to be disappointed.

50:26.157 --> 50:29.557
I was when I found out it was eddie
that gave me the kiss of life.

50:33.097 --> 50:36.332
- You going training now?
- Mm.

50:36.334 --> 50:38.734
Put some down for me, will you?

50:38.736 --> 50:44.540
He can help out...
On the boat or something.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.076
But he wears a life jacket
if he's anywhere near you.

50:52.083 --> 50:55.551
So his mother's not too happy then?
I should have stopped him.

50:55.553 --> 50:59.488
Remember you stopped rob swimming in
here that time? Yeah, he was seven.

50:59.490 --> 51:02.324
He cursed like mad when I pulled him
out 'cause his mates were watching.

51:02.326 --> 51:04.593
Jumped right back in again.

51:04.595 --> 51:07.830
Oh, you know, if I had disobeyed
my father at that age,

51:07.832 --> 51:10.633
he'd have beat
the hell out of me.

51:10.635 --> 51:14.336
But I loved him.

51:14.338 --> 51:19.275
I've never hit rob... Ever.
Not once.

51:19.277 --> 51:22.411
We never can find two words
to say to each other.

51:26.084 --> 51:28.184
Seems like everything's
backwards.

51:43.401 --> 51:46.602
Why don't we just take a chance?
Go down to dover.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.704
It's a long way to go for nothing
if we don't find somebody.

51:48.706 --> 51:52.708
You said yourself, if you don't
find a pilot, you can't swim.

51:52.710 --> 51:56.812
Okay, okay, I'll go there later this week.
I'll come for the ride.

51:56.814 --> 52:00.182
Get a saver. Should be cheap enough.
Take danny too.

52:00.184 --> 52:03.886
Make sure he brings
his water wings this time.

52:13.164 --> 52:14.463
It said "apply thickly."

52:15.900 --> 52:17.533
Maybe we overdid it.

52:32.383 --> 52:35.551
I'm sorry. Oh! Was it the lorry?

52:35.553 --> 52:38.687
Mm-hmm. But he swerved first.
Lunatic.

52:38.689 --> 52:41.690
Mrs. Redmond,
you need to be more...

52:41.692 --> 52:44.212
I'll let you go one more time.

52:52.503 --> 52:54.904
There we are.

52:54.906 --> 52:58.908
Right. I've just had a word
with the barmaid.

52:58.910 --> 53:01.510
Apparently there is a guy
that can do it.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.946
Goes by the name of mad bob.

53:03.948 --> 53:07.249
Mad bob?

53:07.251 --> 53:11.220
- He doesn't sound normal.
- Oh, he sounds friggin' nuts.

53:11.222 --> 53:14.723
Is he here?
You lookin' for a boat?

53:14.725 --> 53:17.793
- We might be.
- Either you are or you're not.

53:19.463 --> 53:21.964
We are.

53:21.966 --> 53:24.687
- So it's you that's gonna be swimmin'?
- Mm-hmm.

53:31.909 --> 53:36.845
If you can't beat me, you
ain't the man to do the swim.

53:36.847 --> 53:39.415
And I ain't the man
to take you.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.872
I take it you're mad bob.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.431
We go on three.

53:57.902 --> 54:00.469
One,

54:01.572 --> 54:03.572
two,

54:03.574 --> 54:06.742
three.

54:06.744 --> 54:10.746
850 the crossing, 200 hundred
deposit, no refunds.

54:10.748 --> 54:13.482
But we get to see your boat?

54:13.484 --> 54:17.386
- What for?
- We get to see the boat.

54:17.388 --> 54:19.308
Righty-ho,
you get to see the boat.

54:22.493 --> 54:24.860
Shark, 35-footer.

54:31.569 --> 54:34.403
Fell off my bike, two-wheeler.

54:34.405 --> 54:36.705
Let's go.

54:39.510 --> 54:40.976
There she is.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.848
Is this yours?

54:48.319 --> 54:50.953
It's all right.

54:50.955 --> 54:56.458
It's good. Yeah, very nice.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.827
- There you go, fellas, tea's up.
- What date is it today?

54:58.829 --> 55:01.063
- Twenty-second of june.
- Aye, it's the 22nd.

55:01.065 --> 55:03.032
Hang on. You sure?

55:03.034 --> 55:04.833
Is that a two or a five?

55:04.835 --> 55:06.969
Yeah, it's the 22nd.

55:10.408 --> 55:13.909
One, two, three.

55:13.911 --> 55:16.545
Blow!

55:16.547 --> 55:18.747
¶For They Are
Jolly good fellows ¶

55:18.749 --> 55:21.617
¶For They Are
Jolly good fellows ¶

55:21.619 --> 55:24.787
¶For They Are
Jolly good fellows ¶

55:24.789 --> 55:28.490
¶And So Say All Of Us
And so say all of us ¶

55:28.492 --> 55:30.959
Where were you?
Sorry, I got held up.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.729
I'll get you some food.
No, it's fine. I've, uh...

55:33.731 --> 55:38.434
and a nice big piece of cake.

55:38.436 --> 55:40.936
- Were you waiting for me?
- Can I open my present now?

55:40.938 --> 55:43.505
They were. -It's fine.
It worked out better.

55:43.507 --> 55:46.875
Come on, let's go crazy!

55:51.716 --> 55:53.549
Hey.

55:55.619 --> 55:59.388
Here. So what did you get them?

55:59.390 --> 56:01.790
The kids? Since when
did I do the shopping?

56:01.792 --> 56:04.393
Your mother
likes to get those things.

56:04.395 --> 56:07.830
You got them those racetracks.

56:07.832 --> 56:09.932
Mom still likes to do that thing, you
know, where she signs the card...

56:09.934 --> 56:12.101
And makes it look like
you've signed it too.

56:16.674 --> 56:18.807
How's your swimming coming on?

56:18.809 --> 56:21.110
I heard you're gonna swim
the english channel.

56:27.151 --> 56:29.952
I didn't tell her.
You were right not to.

56:29.954 --> 56:33.689
Why? Because you heard wrong.

56:33.691 --> 56:36.992
I heard that danny parked merv's
boat halfway up the beach.

56:36.994 --> 56:39.728
And I heard that you were planning
to swim the channel this summer.

56:39.730 --> 56:41.897
Danny gets carried away.

56:48.839 --> 56:51.173
- Saw you down at the library.
- I like reading.

56:51.175 --> 56:53.409
Saw you down at the pool.
I like swimming.

56:53.411 --> 56:54.943
What?

56:57.915 --> 56:59.955
I'm gonna get some jelly
before it's all gone.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.026
You can have another go,
can't you?

57:11.028 --> 57:13.929
I just can't seem
to concentrate lately.

57:13.931 --> 57:18.000
You told him at last then? No, it's not that.
It's something else.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.250
I think he might be
having an affair.

57:25.643 --> 57:27.876
But he's acting so odd.

57:27.878 --> 57:29.978
I'm sorry.
That's just daft. I mean...

57:29.980 --> 57:32.681
well, there's vera.

57:32.683 --> 57:35.451
It's not funny.
She rang last week and...

57:35.453 --> 57:38.120
it's probably just got something
to do with the boat.

57:38.122 --> 57:40.756
- What boat?
- The boat.

57:40.758 --> 57:44.193
The lads are borrowin' a boat
to help frank swim the channel.

57:44.195 --> 57:46.094
What channel?

57:47.531 --> 57:49.631
Thank you.

58:17.561 --> 58:20.095
Nice. Mm.

58:23.767 --> 58:26.935
You know, we were talking
about buying a car.

58:26.937 --> 58:30.973
Mm. I fixed
the wing mirror back on.

58:30.975 --> 58:36.011
Well, michelle says arthur hall
is selling his metro. It's red.

58:36.013 --> 58:39.453
I thought we said a new car could wait?
No, we didn't. You did.

58:40.618 --> 58:43.652
We have to be careful
with the money from now on.

58:43.654 --> 58:46.622
Michelle says the insides
are just like new.

58:49.593 --> 58:51.593
She also says you've been
borrowing merv's boat...

58:51.595 --> 58:54.196
To help you train
to swim the channel.

58:54.198 --> 58:57.478
The english channel. And I was wondering
when you were thinking about telling me.

59:04.308 --> 59:08.043
I was also wondering how it is
we can't afford a new car,

59:08.045 --> 59:11.286
but you can afford to pay for a boat
to show you the way to bloody france.

59:15.185 --> 59:18.745
I'd be worried about you trying to swim all
that way, frank, if I wasn't so angry.

59:23.727 --> 59:26.194
I've never asked you
for anything, frank,

59:26.196 --> 59:28.764
but honesty was something
I took for granted.

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:23.952
Well, look who it is,
three wise monkeys.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.255
Hey, rob, your dad's just got
a few more lengths to do.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:29.825
Why don't we wait for him outside?
I know about his little secret.

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:31.393
I just wanna talk to him. Is that all right?
No, no, no, come on.

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.195
- Eddie...
- Hey! Hey!

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:43.205
You're a liar, dad.

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:46.008
You lied to me
about swimming the channel.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:50.178
Maybe I did.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.414
Why?

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:58.787
Is it because I don't have a job?
It's not about you.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.690
Because I look after the twins?
I'm not ashamed of that, dad!

01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:04.226
I'm not ashamed
like you think I should be!

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:06.662
Good! You're not ashamed!

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:09.765
No, but you are.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:14.436
You're the one who's ashamed!

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:18.807
I'm not listening to this. Why? What
are you afraid of? Afraid I'll drown?

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:21.777
Look at me, I'm drowning!

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:30.819
Thirty-six years!
Thirty-six years!

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:33.822
Twelve hours a day,
five days a week!

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:37.426
Now you tell me, when was I
supposed to go shopping!

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:21.970
He'll be okay.
Just needs time to cool off.

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:24.106
We need to make sure
you keep up the times tomorrow.

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.208
No. What?

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.110
No.

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:38.153
- I can't do it.
- But, frank...

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:40.422
I can't do it.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:44.192
He's right. Come on,
frank, come on.

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:46.228
I'm not going to be swimming.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.823
Your father didn't mean
to hurt you.

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:20.862
I was married once.

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:27.035
Her name was bridget.

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:29.271
She left me for a jam salesman.

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:33.542
She never even liked jam.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:41.016
I didn't bother
with women again after that.

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:44.252
I was always too scared the same
thing would happen all over.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:49.057
If anyone tried to get close,
I just pushed them away.

01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:57.065
Your father did the same thing with you
after the accident, pushed you away.

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:02.871
He blames me.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:06.608
No, he doesn't. He blames himself.
Always has.

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:14.950
Now you're soakin' the seat,
and it's leather. It'll stain.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:07.936
All that way, frank.

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:20.088
I thought we were
too old for secrets.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:26.421
Like learning
how to drive a bus?

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:42.671
There was an ad in the paper.

01:05:42.673 --> 01:05:45.273
I failed twice.

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:50.078
But I'm going to take it again.
I'm not givin' up.

01:06:19.076 --> 01:06:22.711
Let's just play when it smashes.

01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:24.746
All right, you ready?
You take that one, all right?

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:27.582
One, two...

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:41.763
We're not catching
the train, james.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:45.533
There's no point in racing.
I've got the keys, remember.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:51.673
- Pappy.
- Shh.

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:57.145
- Are you playing a game?
- Yeah.

01:06:57.147 --> 01:06:58.613
Don't make me come back out.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.415
You better go inside.

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:07.389
Is it a secret? Yeah.

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:09.190
Like daddy's wee brother?

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:15.397
He says we mustn't talk about
him, that it makes you sad.

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:17.365
Does it make you sad?

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:20.535
Sometimes.

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:25.640
- I won't tell.
- Good boy.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.747
Are you going to
swim the channel?

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:36.084
I don't know.
What do you think?

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:37.752
Dad says it's too dangerous.

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.825
What is the channel?

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:48.229
It's the sea
between england and france.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:52.233
Are there any sharks?

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.402
No sharks.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:57.472
- Crocodiles?
- Mm-mm.

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:59.741
- Piranhas?
- Bananas?

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:02.744
- Piranhas.
- Piranhas.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:05.613
No, no piranhas.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:08.349
It doesn't sound
too dangerous to me then.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:10.151
I'll count to five.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.796
I can swim like a fish.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:36.917
Are you stopping out here all day,
or are you planning to come in?

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:14.282
Hey, big man, you not swimmin'?

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.477
Yes!

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.850
That's five pounds you owe me.
I told you he'd be here.

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:56.824
We're a delegation.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.962
A delegation?

01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:04.399
It's a kind of a gang.
Thanks for that, danny.

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:10.238
Does the delegation
have a proposal?

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.975
Yeah. We think
you're wrong to give up.

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:17.946
Now we've come this far.

01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:21.416
We also think you are a big daft
bollocks for giving... you see that?

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:23.619
See that little lad
with red hair?

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:29.224
It takes everything out of him
just to swim one width. Just one.

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:33.394
He won't take any help,

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:36.998
and he never gives up... Ever.

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:45.220
And when he gets to
the other side... yes!

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:50.612
I'm not givin' up.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.121
That toilet
needs cleaning again.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:22.443
Do it yourself.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:39.427
Take it steady.

01:11:39.429 --> 01:11:42.330
All right, ladies? Pam.

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:44.799
- Oh, my god!
- All right, love.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:46.734
Nearly finished?

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:50.818
Only I thought we might go out.

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:53.074
You mean together?

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:02.083
Oh, aye. You and me.
Me and you.

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:12.560
Excuse me.

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:15.096
Please don't drop the bags.
They split.

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:18.866
Oh, aye.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.735
Sorry, pal.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:29.944
- See you wednesday.
- See you wednesday.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.993
I nearly drowned. We heard.

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:49.464
In the sea? What were
you doing in the sea?

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:53.000
I don't know.
Do you wanna go out with me?

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:59.407
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.008
That's good.

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:05.012
Happy days.

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:24.866
You smell of chlorine.

01:13:24.868 --> 01:13:26.908
Like dad when he was laid out.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.609
He used to smell of oil
and woodbines.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:41.115
I was 16.

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:43.117
You came down to talk to dad
about something.

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:47.054
I couldn't believe
how handsome you were.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.601
I'm learning to drive a bus.

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:04.739
And then, if I pass,
I'm going to drive a bus.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:08.142
It'll be my job. A proper job.

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:10.044
Driving a bus.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.615
I'm going up.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.520
So should you.
You have a big day tomorrow.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.662
Thanks for the sandwiches.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.232
Good luck.

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:09.070
That, uh, time...
When I came to see your father,

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:10.938
I didn't.

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:15.643
I came to see you.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.554
I spy with my little eye, something beginning with...
you'll never get this... "a."

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:28.623
Air freshener. No.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.992
Ambulance.
No. You may get it, norman.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:33.294
Why? 'Cause you're nearer it.

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:35.930
You could say you're on it.
I'm on it?

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:37.832
Kind of. Arse.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:41.235
No. 'Cause you'd have that as well,
unless it was norman's arse.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:44.305
- Leave my arse out of this.
- And that would be n-a.

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:33.588
You okay with heights?

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:36.290
Yeah. You?

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:38.292
Oh, yeah. You sure?

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:40.861
Mm-hmm.

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:46.033
I was thinking about joan.

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.935
I should have told her.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:50.972
Don't know what I was hiding.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.744
- Maybe we should leave him alone.
- Why?

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:59.146
- We should be there for him.
- What if he doesn't want us there?

01:16:59.148 --> 01:17:01.716
Oh, you're as pigheaded
as your father.

01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:04.919
Of course he wants us there.
He just doesn't know how to ask.

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:07.221
But he's not going to
achieve anything by it.

01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:10.658
How do you know?

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.660
Because he's not going to bring
stuart back by swimming the channel.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:17.198
Oh, rob.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.934
It's not stuart he wants back.

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:25.706
I'm away.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:34.715
Mom, thanks for the toys.

01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:36.384
Oh, it's okay.

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:40.655
What toys?

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:51.032
Better out than in, right?

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:54.035
For god's sake.

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:56.137
One more of them
and you're sleeping in the car.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.878
I knew a guy once...
Could fart in german.

01:18:16.893 --> 01:18:19.860
You took your time.

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.429
I'm sittin' in the front.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.737
The observer fellow
seems all right.

01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:41.482
Right, it's 5:00. Let's get crackin'.
Okay, don't forget.

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:45.419
Don't touch the boat or anyone on it once you
get going, or it will invalidate your swim.

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:48.089
When you get to france,
get all the way onto dry land,

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:50.291
pick up a stone
and bring it back to the boat.

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:53.327
- Okay.
- Good luck.

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:58.032
Thank you. Thank you. Well, go.

01:18:58.034 --> 01:18:59.800
Good luck, mate.
Good luck, frank.

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:01.969
Thanks, lads.

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.037
Right.

01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:10.778
- See youse.
- You're not joining us?

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:14.815
No, I don't float very well.
Me neither.

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:19.487
Okay.

01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:26.520
Come on, frank! That's the way!

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.971
Ah, we'll be there
in no time, frank.

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:22.376
The right and the left.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:27.214
One, two, three, four! Oh!

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:30.484
I'm all right, frank.
I'm all right. Carry on.

01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:36.190
You passed, didn't you?

01:21:36.192 --> 01:21:39.560
I thought you'd never ask.
Well done, mom.

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:42.296
Congratulations.
That's brilliant.

01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:45.738
Well, I think we should
celebrate with a gumdrop.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.520
- The fumes are killing me.
- I can't help that.

01:22:08.691 --> 01:22:11.392
I'm keeping this close
to keep you on course.

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:16.196
I can't breathe!

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:19.198
- I'll go ahead.
- Well, what bloody use will I be then?

01:22:21.037 --> 01:22:23.537
Stupid bastard. Bloody fool!

01:22:32.081 --> 01:22:34.581
I am confident.

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:38.319
I am confident. I am a lion.

01:22:38.321 --> 01:22:40.254
I am a lion.
I'm not a timorous beastie.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.491
I'm a lion!

01:23:02.078 --> 01:23:04.545
He's doing great, isn't he?

01:23:04.547 --> 01:23:08.382
No, he's not. At this rate, he's not gonna
make it to the cap before the ebb tide.

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:10.751
And if he doesn't, he's gonna
get swept back out to sea.

01:23:10.753 --> 01:23:13.253
Isn't that being a bit bleak?
No, he's right.

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:16.357
Look, I'll pick up the pace
and he's gonna have to keep up.

01:23:16.359 --> 01:23:18.158
- Bloody hell.
- Better do some hypothermia checks.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.593
Can we get closer to him?

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:27.134
Frank, where are you
swimming from?

01:23:27.136 --> 01:23:30.070
England.

01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:33.707
- Where in england?
- Dover.

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:36.710
- What day is it?
- What?

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:40.714
- What day is it?
- Thursday.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.283
He seems all right.

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:58.165
Come on.

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:01.702
I didn't think to ask where
in france he was swimming to.

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:04.338
There, that's where
he's swimming to.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.507
- How do you know?
- Pappy showed me.

01:24:06.509 --> 01:24:09.276
- When did pappy show you?
- I'm not telling you.

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.650
How many times
did you try it yourself?

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:19.753
Three. Did you ever make it?

01:24:19.755 --> 01:24:21.555
Third time lucky.

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:36.684
There it is, sortie, way out.

01:24:57.693 --> 01:25:01.428
What is it? Ebb tide.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:05.099
- It's dragging him back out.
- What if he can't beat it?

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:08.235
Can't we do anything?

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:11.605
- He's in for the long haul.
- He won't be able to last that long.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:15.242
Yes, he will. He won't. His
body temperature is dropping.

01:25:15.244 --> 01:25:17.804
If he doesn't make this beach,
he's not gonna make it at all.

01:25:18.747 --> 01:25:23.450
Frank! You've only three miles
to go, frank!

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:26.753
I know you're hurtin', but you gotta swim
faster, frank. The tide's against you.

01:25:26.755 --> 01:25:29.690
Frank, you gotta swim faster.
Come on!

01:25:36.332 --> 01:25:39.299
You can do it, frank.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:41.135
You can do it.

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:13.212
Stay there. Stay there. Don't move!
Don't you move from there!

01:26:21.377 --> 01:26:23.911
Stop that.

01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:28.215
Stop it.

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:43.564
Come on, frank, come on.

01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:24.838
Is he all right?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.008
No!

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:35.582
Bloody hell.

01:27:53.302 --> 01:27:55.736
I need to come out, lads.

01:27:57.339 --> 01:27:59.706
What do you think you're doing?

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:03.043
Why don't you just take it slower
for a wee while. See if it passes.

01:28:03.045 --> 01:28:07.781
I'm sorry, chan.
I can't do it, mate.

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:11.518
- You're nearly there. Look, it's not far.
- I can't do it.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.821
Frank, your body's hurting because
you're beginning to burn fat.

01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:17.491
It won't last though. Carry on,
you'll get through it. Yeah, frank.

01:28:17.493 --> 01:28:20.394
It's just a pain barrier.
It's all in your mind.

01:28:20.396 --> 01:28:23.730
- Get me out. It's too far.
- Bollocks. It's always been this far.

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:27.634
- You come in and swim it then!
- Fine. Get on board, we can all go home.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:32.439
All my life I've looked up
to you, frank. All my life.

01:28:32.441 --> 01:28:35.642
I never saw you back down from anything.
It's too far.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.879
I'm nobody, me, I know that.

01:28:38.881 --> 01:28:43.383
But I'm not daft.
I see what's going on here.

01:28:43.385 --> 01:28:45.319
Out here
in the middle of nowhere.

01:28:48.357 --> 01:28:50.717
But he's not here,
is he, frank?

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.794
He never was.

01:28:55.698 --> 01:28:58.018
It's taken you 23 years
to find that out.

01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:05.105
So what now?

01:29:07.443 --> 01:29:08.975
Well, I'll tell you what now.

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:14.948
You get back to swimming, and you
shut up about how far it is.

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:17.818
And you shut up
about how much it hurts.

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.421
Because you don't have a choice.
You never did.

01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:25.359
So, come on.

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:27.394
Get stuck in and put some down.

01:29:27.396 --> 01:29:29.596
We're wasting time.

01:29:41.410 --> 01:29:43.009
I'll go on then.

01:29:52.087 --> 01:29:55.589
It's him!
No, I can't see for sure, but...

01:29:55.591 --> 01:29:57.524
yeah, that's frank! That's frank!
Let me see! Let me see!

01:29:57.526 --> 01:30:00.046
That's frank in the water.

01:30:18.447 --> 01:30:20.847
Right there. Can you see him?

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.821
Come on. Let's go.

01:30:27.823 --> 01:30:29.556
Come on.
I need to be there, mum.

01:30:29.558 --> 01:30:31.625
Come on, mum.

01:30:31.627 --> 01:30:33.960
My god.

01:32:17.933 --> 01:32:20.600
Yes.

01:32:22.938 --> 01:32:25.672
If he touches him before he gets
out of the water, it won't count.

01:32:25.674 --> 01:32:29.709
- It won't be recognized. The swim won't be recognized.
- Don't!

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:35.081
- Don't touch him! Rob!
- Let him get out of the water.

01:32:55.637 --> 01:32:57.070
What's he want?

01:33:09.051 --> 01:33:10.984
Come on.

01:33:27.803 --> 01:33:30.737
What?

01:33:30.739 --> 01:33:32.906
Did I Miss something?

01:33:41.016 --> 01:33:43.149
Yes!

01:33:44.286 --> 01:33:46.886
Come on.

01:33:46.888 --> 01:33:50.357
Come on!

01:34:09.378 --> 01:34:13.647
We made it!
We swam the channel!

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:16.650
Frank!

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:24.391
Norman!

01:34:24.393 --> 01:34:26.292
I took the ferry.

01:34:29.264 --> 01:34:32.666
Get the stone! Get the stone!

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:35.028
Let him get the stone.
Pick up a stone.

01:34:36.305 --> 01:34:42.451
