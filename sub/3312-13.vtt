WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:09.577
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.213
SO HOW DO I LOOK?

00:12.246 --> 00:14.115
OH, JUST LIKE ME!

00:14.148 --> 00:15.749
- I'M GONNA GO CHANGE.
- NO NO NO!

00:15.783 --> 00:19.153
I JUST MEAN YOU LOOK APPROPRIATE
FOR AN INTERN AT CITY HALL.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.654
JUST WAIT TILL YOUR
BOSS SEES YOU.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.590
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT.
I'M YOUR BOSS.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.358
I SEE YOU!

00:25.559 --> 00:27.128
- YO.
- Mel: HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.596
A PAIR OF MEL BURKES.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.731
WHICH IS THE SCARIEST
HAND IN POKER.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.734
LOOK AT YOU ALL DRESSED UP IN
YOUR LITTLE INTERN COSTUME, HUH?

00:33.767 --> 00:36.637
YEP, SHE'S GONNA SHADOW ME
FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS...

00:36.670 --> 00:39.407
LEARN WHAT I DO,
WATCH MY EVERY MOVE.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.009
MAKE SURE YOU TEACH HER
HOW TO DO THIS ONE.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.112
I GOT THAT ONE DOWN. SEE?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.346
OOH, NICE!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.115
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.749
AMATEURS.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.451
REMEMBER WHEN WE GET
TO THE OFFICE...

00:50.484 --> 00:52.753
NO SPECIAL TREATMENT
AND NO PET NAMES.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.756
OKAY? I'M MISS SCANLON, NOT
HONEY, PUMPKIN OR SUGAR BOOGER.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.226
ALL RIGHT, HONEY, BUT, YOU
KNOW, IF A CAKE SHOWS UP

00:58.259 --> 01:00.128
THAT SAYS "BEST INTERN EVER,"
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.795
- AUNT MEL!
- AW, HONEY, I'M KIDDING.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.798
CANCEL THE CAKE.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.268
- JOE, I'M READY.
- HERE YOU GO, BUDDY. THERE'S YOUR LUNCH.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.671
TURKEY SANDWICH, CARROTS...

01:10.704 --> 01:13.073
AND A DAMP SPONGE.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.075
WHAT? SORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.778
I DIDN'T GET A LOT OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT.
HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.748
YOU KNOW, IF GIVEN THE CHOICE,
I'D PREFER THE SANDWICH.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.816
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.387
HOPE I DIDN'T TRY TO CLEAN MY
SHOWER WITH YOUR SANDWICH.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.157
UM, JOE, ARE YOU EVEN AWAKE YET?

01:29.190 --> 01:31.725
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT YOU DRIVING
RYDER TO SCHOOL IN YOUR CONDITION.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.727
RELAX, I KNOW THAT ROUTE
LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.729
I COULD DRIVE IT WITH MY
EYES CLOSED IF I HAD TO.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.698
IN FACT, I HAVE.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.667
I WAS BY MYSELF.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.203
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO,
SUGAR BOOGER...

01:42.236 --> 01:45.639
I MEAN MISS SUGAR BOOGER.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.509
LENNOX GETS TO SKIP SCHOOL?
I WANT AN INTERNSHIP.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.545
FINE, YOU CAN BE MY INTERN. TELL
YOUR OWN BUTT TO GET IN THE CAR.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.314
THIS INTERNSHIP SUCKS.

01:53.347 --> 01:57.451
TRY DOING THE ACTUAL JOB, DUDE.
LET'S GO.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.687
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD
- ♪ All good

01:59.720 --> 02:01.555

02:17.905 --> 02:20.408
ATTENTION, EVERYBODY,
THIS IS LENNOX SCANLON,

02:20.441 --> 02:21.842
AND EVEN THOUGH SHE IS MY NIECE,

02:21.875 --> 02:25.713
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY GIVING THIS
PRETTY LADY SPECIAL TREATMENT.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.549
- BUT YESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT...
- NO, ZIP IT, WYATT.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.318
- SO DON'T DO THE SONG?
- NO.

02:30.351 --> 02:34.388
INTRUDER ALERT. COUNCILWOMAN
MUELLER IS WAITING IN YOUR OFFICE.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.723
OH, MUELLER!

02:35.756 --> 02:37.891
IS SHE, LIKE, YOUR B.F.F.?

02:37.925 --> 02:40.194
YEAH, BIG FISH FACE.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.396
I CLEANED THAT UP JUST FOR YOU.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.898
YEAH, THAT WOMAN IS AGAINST
EVERYTHING I STAND FOR.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.301
YOU KNOW SHE TRIED TO STOP
WINE SALES ON SUNDAYS.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.902
SHE KNOWS THAT'S MY
FAVORITE DRINKING DAY.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.839
AND NOW SHE'S PLOTTING TO
KILL THE TOLEDO STREET SCENE.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.841
BUT THAT MUSIC FESTIVAL'S
BEEN AROUND FOREVER.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.443
YEAH, SINCE I WAS A KID.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.611
EXACTLY, FOREVER.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.914
OKAY, I'M GONNA LET THAT GO
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.584
BETTY.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.319
- BURKE.
- SUCH A PLEASURE.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.922
IS IT? I WASN'T SO SURE
AFTER OUR LAST MEETING.

03:08.956 --> 03:12.626
I RECALL YOU REFERRED TO
ME AS "TURKEY JOWLS."

03:12.660 --> 03:15.529
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I WAS
TOLD MY MICROPHONE WAS OFF.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.865
AND I BELIEVE IT WAS
IN THAT SAME MEETING

03:17.898 --> 03:20.768
THAT YOU CALLED ME "THE
ESTEEMED COUNCIL PIMP."

03:20.801 --> 03:22.770
I DID SAY "ESTEEMED."

03:22.803 --> 03:26.474
THANK YOU FOR THAT. THIS IS
MY INTERN, LENNOX SCANLON.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.775
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:27.808 --> 03:32.646
WELL, THIS IS MY INTERN,
CALVIN SOMETHING.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.616
- IT'S CAMERON.
- YOU WANT COLLEGE CREDIT OR NOT?

03:35.649 --> 03:38.952
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET DOWN TO THIS
TOLEDO-STREET-SCENE BUSINESS.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.854
YOUR HIPPY HOOTENANNY
IS A MENACE.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.823
PARDON ME, THE STREET SCENE
IS A JOYOUS CELEBRATION

03:42.856 --> 03:44.825
THAT BRINGS THE WHOLE
COMMUNITY TOGETHER.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.961
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IT BRINGS?
S.T.D.s...

03:47.995 --> 03:50.531
SEWAGE, TRASH AND DEBRIS,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.833
AND ACTUAL S.T.D.s.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.436
NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESSES
ARE UP IN ARMS

03:55.469 --> 03:57.405
ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.740
SINCE WHEN IS SPENDING
MONEY A NEGATIVE IMPACT?

03:59.773 --> 04:02.810
I HAVE THE NUMBERS HERE DIRECT
FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.946
MISS SCANLON, WOULD YOU MAKE COPIES
OF THESE FOR MY VENERABLE COLLEAGUE?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.881
GOT IT, MISS BURKE.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.317
I HAVE EVIDENCE TOO...

04:09.350 --> 04:12.953
LETTERS FROM LOCAL BUSINESSES
DEMANDING WE SHUT IT DOWN.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.322
- CARLTON?
- CAMERON.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.256
WHATEVER! COPIES!

04:18.759 --> 04:21.329
I DON'T THINK MY COUNCILWOMAN

04:21.362 --> 04:22.830
LIKES YOUR COUNCILWOMAN
VERY MUCH.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.933
I KNOW. THAT WAS LIKE A
CAGE MATCH WITH PANTYHOSE.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.936
UNFORTUNATELY, MUELLER
DOESN'T WEAR PANTYHOSE.

04:28.969 --> 04:29.870
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

04:29.903 --> 04:31.972
I BLOCKED IT OUT.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.642
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN IN THE INTERN GAME?

04:34.675 --> 04:38.011
OH, WOW. I GO BACK LIKE...

04:38.045 --> 04:40.280
20 MINUTES.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.983
A NEWBIE. UM, I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOREVER...

04:43.016 --> 04:44.418
THREE WHOLE DAYS.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.687
OH, SO YOU CAN GIVE ME THE 411.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.888
SURE.

04:47.921 --> 04:51.258
UH, FIRST I THINK YOU HAVE TO
PUT YOUR DOCUMENT FACEDOWN,

04:51.291 --> 04:53.293
BUT ONLY IF YOU WANT
THE WORDS TO SHOW UP.

04:53.327 --> 04:57.965
SO YOU MEAN BRINGING BACK BLANK PIECES
OF PAPER WOULD MAKE ME LOOK BAD?

04:57.998 --> 05:00.801
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
WOULD MAKE YOU LOOK BAD.

05:02.703 --> 05:07.408
AS USUAL, YOU FAIL TO GRASP
THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.643
I THINK ALL THAT PEROXIDE
YOU PUT ON YOUR HAIR

05:09.677 --> 05:12.012
MUST HAVE SEEPED
THROUGH TO YOUR BRAIN.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.349
HEY, THIS USED TO BE NATURAL.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.017
LISTEN, TWINKIE,

05:17.050 --> 05:19.319
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN ON THE CITY
COUNCIL AS LONG AS I HAVE,

05:19.353 --> 05:21.655
YOU'LL LEARN THERE'S A
LOT MORE TO POLITICS

05:21.689 --> 05:25.426
THAN PANDERING TO THE STONERS
AND THE BOOZE HOUNDS.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.928
AND IN ALL THAT TIME, NO ONE EVER
TAUGHT YOU HOW TO USE MOUTHWASH?

05:31.098 --> 05:33.333
- 4289.
- ( phone beeping )

05:33.367 --> 05:35.936
- I'LL CALL YOU.
- NOT IF I CALL YOU FIRST.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.071
- STOP TALKING TO HER!
- STOP TALKING TO HIM.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.642
CLARENCE, LET'S GO!

05:41.675 --> 05:43.877
WHAT WERE YOU TWO DOING?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.546
WELL, I WAS JUST BEING NICE.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.881
THIS IS GOVERNMENT. WE
DON'T DO THAT HERE.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.058
WHOA! OH.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.560
CATCHING UP ON SOME SLEEP?

05:59.593 --> 06:03.931
NO NO NO, I WAS JUST SITTING
HERE RECHARGING MY EYEBALLS.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.065
IN A PUDDLE OF DROOL?

06:05.098 --> 06:08.469
WHAT? OH. YEAH.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.405
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I MAY
AS WELL TELL YOU.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.341
SINCE I STILL CAN'T SEEM TO
GET A REAL EXECUTIVE JOB

06:14.374 --> 06:17.678
HERE IN THIS COUNTRY, I
ACTUALLY FOUND A JOB OVERSEAS.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.013
- YOU DID?
- I DID. IT'S JUST PART-TIME.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.049
IT'S ACTUALLY AN
ONLINE CONSULTING GIG

06:22.082 --> 06:24.017
WITH THIS RUSSIAN
FINANCE COMPANY.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.720
AND WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS MOONLIGHTING YOU'RE DOING?

06:26.754 --> 06:31.559
WELL, IF YOU HADN'T WALKED IN
ON ME SLEEPING, PROBABLY NEVER.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.360
AND HOW LONG HAS
THIS BEEN GOING ON?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.728
JUST A FEW WEEKS, ALL RIGHT?

06:34.762 --> 06:36.664
IT'S JUST A COUPLE HOURS
A DAY FROM 1:00 TO 3:00.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.032
OH, THAT'S NOT SO BAD. I MEAN, THE
KIDS ARE STILL IN SCHOOL THEN.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.035
IT'S 1:00 TO 3:00 A.M., BECAUSE
THAT'S BUSINESS HOURS IN RUSSIA.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.037
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S
NOT GOING TO INTERFERE

06:44.071 --> 06:46.039
WITH MY JOB RESPONSIBILITIES
HERE AT THE HOUSE.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.108
THE HOUSE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO BURN DOWN?

06:48.141 --> 06:49.677
THE WHAT?

06:49.710 --> 06:51.812
OH MY... SHOOT!

06:51.845 --> 06:54.114
OH, WHOOPS. HOLD ON.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.850
I HOPE YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
FOR BLACKENED LASAGNA.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.152
HEY, YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
A FIRE, JUST DROOL ON IT.

06:59.186 --> 07:02.055
( alarm beeping )

07:07.628 --> 07:10.798
- HEY, AUNT MEL.
- HEY, RYDER, NICE HICKEY.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.467
OH, GOD, IS IT... IS
IT THAT NOTICEABLE?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.769
NO.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.170
ONLY FROM SPACE.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.540
OKAY, HELP ME. HOW
DO I GET RID OF IT?

07:19.573 --> 07:23.744
OH, NOTHING WORKS...
FROM WHAT I HEAR.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.113
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TRY COVERING
IT UP, I HAVE SOME MAKEUP.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.081
MAKEUP IS FOR GIRLS. NO WAY.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.851
DAMN, MONSTER HICKEY.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.553
GIVE ME THE MAKEUP.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.688
TOP DRAWER OF MY
BATHROOM VANITY.

07:34.722 --> 07:37.190
SO WHAT YOU WORKIN' ON?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.159
OH, MY POSITION PAPER
FOR THE STREET SCENE.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.094
- MMM.
- HEY, LOOK, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE

07:41.128 --> 07:43.163
IF I WAS A LITTLE CURT
WITH YOU TODAY AT WORK.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.133
YOU KNOW? IT'S JUST I DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING TOO COZY WITH THE ENEMY.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.869
CAMERON'S NOT THE ENEMY.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.039
CAMERON WORKS FOR MUELLER
AND MUELLER PLAYS DIRTY.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.574
BUT I LIKE CAMERON.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.176
MMM, MAYBE YOU DON'T.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.879
MMM, MAYBE I DO.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.214
MMM, MAYBE I DON'T WANT YOU
TALKING TO HIM ANYMORE.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.751
- ( knock on door )
- I'LL GET IT.

08:06.620 --> 08:10.490
HEY, LENNOX. UH,
COUNCILWOMAN BURKE.

08:10.524 --> 08:13.627
MAYBE DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.163
HEY! DID YOU SEE THAT?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.065
PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER DO THAT.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.101
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.103
GOOD. BOYS ARE SO MUCH SIMPLER.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.739
YEAH. HEY, WHICH ONE OF THESE
MATCHES MY SKIN TONE BETTER,

08:25.773 --> 08:27.240
BISQUE OR IVORY?

08:27.274 --> 08:31.879
NEITHER. ANYONE COULD SEE
YOU'RE A BUFF PEACH.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.888
MORNING. EVENING. WHATEVER.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.723
IT'S ALMOST 1:00 A.M.
YOU CAN'T SLEEP?

08:42.756 --> 08:46.226
NOT A WINK. OH, GOOD NEWS IS, I'M
ALL CAUGHT UP ON "STORAGE WARS."

08:46.259 --> 08:48.629
OH, GOOD.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.800
WOW, BUSINESS ON THE TOP,
PARTY ON THE BOTTOM.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.267
IT'S LIKE THE
MULLET OF CLOTHING.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.903
I ONLY CONSULT
FROM THE WAIST UP.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.170
I GOT A MEETING WITH
RUSSIA IN A FEW MINUTES.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.172
WELL, YOU'D BETTER
GET ON THE FREEWAY.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.274
YEAH. UM...

09:03.310 --> 09:05.545
I KNOW I'M GOING TO
REGRET THIS LATER,

09:05.579 --> 09:08.215
BUT, UM... ( exhales )

09:08.248 --> 09:11.151
THIS THING THAT'S KEEPING YOU UP,
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

09:11.184 --> 09:12.920
I'M REGRETTING IT ALREADY.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.823
IT'S THIS WHOLE LENNOX-CAMERON THING.
YOU KNOW?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.258
THIS INTERNSHIP WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING
ME AND LENNOX CLOSER TOGETHER.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.628
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? THE KID HAD
HER HOME BEFORE HER CURFEW.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.663
WELL, SHE SHOULDN'T BE
GOING OUT WITH HIM AT ALL.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.297
THIS IS POLITICS, JOE.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.935
WHAT IF CAMERON IS JUST USING
LENNOX TO GET INSIDE INFORMATION?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.770
LIKE WHAT? THE
TOLEDO LAUNCH CODES?

09:29.803 --> 09:33.206
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THIS HAS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS AT ALL.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.710
I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU TRYING
TO DRESS LENNOX UP LIKE A MINI MEL,

09:36.744 --> 09:38.111
AND SHE'S NOT YOU.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.548
YES, SHE IS. WELL, I
MEAN, SHE COULD BE.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.283
AS I EXPECTED.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.687
THIS WHOLE INTERNSHIP WAS ABOUT
TURNING LENNOX INTO YOU.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.589
WHY DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE HAVE KIDS, JOE?

09:49.623 --> 09:52.993
YOU KNOW? SO THAT YOU HAVE A NEWER,
FRESHER VERSION OF YOURSELF.

09:53.026 --> 09:56.063
THAT WAY WHEN YOU DIE,
YOU DIDN'T REALLY.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.331
WOW.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.867
OKAY, WELL, PUTTING ASIDE

09:59.900 --> 10:01.835
THAT VERY RATIONAL
IMMORTALITY ARGUMENT,

10:01.869 --> 10:04.204
I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM IF
CAMERON GOES OUT WITH LENNOX.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.206
I MEAN, HE'S A
BOY, SHE'S A GIRL.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.742
TRUST ME, THE LAST THING THAT'S GOING TO
BE ON EITHER OF THEIR MINDS IS POLITICS.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.978
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS
AN INTERN FOR MY DAD,

10:11.011 --> 10:13.046
HE WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE BILLS HE WAS WORKING ON,

10:13.080 --> 10:15.248
BUT THE ONLY BILL I WAS
INTERESTED IN WAS BILL HAMMOND.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.817
OH, AND BILLY GINSBURG.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.286
AND TATTOO BILL DOWN
AT THE YOGURT SHOP.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.322
ONCE AGAIN, WOW.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.324
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.660
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
WAS SO WORRIED.

10:26.694 --> 10:31.298
IT TURNS OUT THAT LENNOX IS JUST
MAKING OUT WITH SOME GUY SHE JUST MET.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.934
GREAT, NOW I'M UPSET.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.372
SO I WILL SEND YOU A REVISED
FIVE-YEAR PERFORMER

10:39.406 --> 10:41.374
WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS
THAT WE DISCUSSED

10:41.408 --> 10:44.377
AND THEN WE CAN DECIDE IF THE
CASH-FLOW ESTIMATES ARE WITHIN RANGE.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.914
Thank you, Mr. Longo. We're
looking forward to reviewing it.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.982
- DO SVIDANIJA.
- Do svidanija.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.119
Please, Mr. Longo, remain
on the line for a moment

10:52.152 --> 10:54.654
so we can discuss the
agenda for next meeting.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.723
OF COURSE, MISS ROMANOV.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.361
The coast is clear, Joseph.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.030
LET ME JUST SET THE MOOD.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.307
HOW DO YOU SAY
"VOILA" IN RUSSIAN?

11:14.341 --> 11:15.809
Voilà!

11:15.843 --> 11:18.278
MAY I POUR YOU A
GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.647
Yes, and I will
pour one for you.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.315
WHY, THANK YOU.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.317
( soft music playing )

11:24.351 --> 11:27.154
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE
A TOAST TO YOU.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.722
Za vas.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.993
OH, BY THE WAY, I GOT THE
PACKAGE THAT YOU SENT FOR ME.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.194
Did you open it yet?

11:34.227 --> 11:37.164
NO, I WANTED TO WAIT FOR YOU.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.902
MY GOODNESS. THANK YOU.

11:41.935 --> 11:46.073
I LOVE RUSSIAN POETRY, I'LL BET.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.241
I also got the package
you sent to me.

11:48.275 --> 11:52.746
In fact, I'm wearing
it right now.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.348
WOW.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.785
I REALLY DO KNOW HOW
TO SHOP FOR ME.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.920
I MEAN, YOU.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.060
- DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
- OF COURSE, MISS SCANLON.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.262
ACTUALLY, I'M HERE AS LENNOX...

12:09.296 --> 12:10.998
YOU KNOW, SUGAR BOOGER.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.466
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.103
I SHOULDN'T HAVE JUST RUN OFF.
IT WASN'T RIGHT.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.371
AW, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS
YOUR AGE ONCE, HONEY.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.942
I'VE HAD MY HEAD TURNED
BY MANY CUTE BILLS...

12:21.975 --> 12:24.277
UH, BOYS.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.280
- SO WE'RE OKAY?
- YEAH, WE'RE OKAY.

12:27.314 --> 12:31.484
GREAT, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN GIVING
THE STREET SCENE A LOT OF THOUGHT

12:31.518 --> 12:33.320
AND I HAD A COUPLE IDEAS,

12:33.353 --> 12:36.123
SO I JUST KIND OF INTEGRATED
THEM INTO YOUR POSITION PAPER.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.492
WOW. THIS IS A LOT OF CHANGES.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.428
EH, NOT THAT MANY.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.865
UM, DONATION TO DEFRAY
SANITATION COSTS;

12:44.898 --> 12:46.834
POSSIBLE CHANGE OF VENUE.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.136
A FEW COMPROMISE NOTIONS.

12:49.169 --> 12:53.073
( exhales ) THESE AREN'T
COMPROMISEY; THESE ARE MUELLERY.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.975
HAS CAMERON BEEN FEEDING
YOU HIS BOSS'S IDEAS?

12:55.008 --> 12:56.509
YOU TWO WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE MAKING OUT.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.479
WHAT, I CAN'T HAVE A THOUGHT IN MY HEAD
UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE PUTS IT THERE?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.282
NO, YOU CAN HAVE A THOUGHT IN YOUR
HEAD, JUST NOT THESE THOUGHTS.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.051
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A MINI
ME, NOT A MINI MUELLER.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.954
I'M NOT A MINI ANYBODY. I'M
A REGULAR-SIZED LENNOX.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.755
AND THESE ARE ALL MY IDEAS.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.423
OH, DID CAMERON TELL
YOU TO SAY THAT?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.960
OH, HERE'S ANOTHER THOUGHT
THAT I JUST HAD ALL ON MY OWN:

13:12.993 --> 13:15.395
I'M THROUGH WITH THIS
LOUSY INTERNSHIP. I QUIT!

13:15.428 --> 13:16.496
BUT, LENNOX!

13:16.529 --> 13:18.398
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:18.431 --> 13:21.534
I'M NOT WEARING THIS
STUPID BLAZER ANYMORE.

13:21.568 --> 13:25.538
'KAY! I'LL SEE YOU
AT HOME, HONEY.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.541
SHE REALLY LOVES ME.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.220
- WHAT'S UP, JOE?
- HEY, BUDDY.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.156
WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF MAKEUP
ON THAT HICKEY, MAN.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.492
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
WHICH WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO,

13:45.525 --> 13:48.195
THAT WAS LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR. DON'T YOU
WANT TO SHOW THAT OFF TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS,

13:48.228 --> 13:50.030
SHOW THEM WHAT HOLLY DID TO YOU?

13:50.063 --> 13:53.500
THE THING IS, UM,
IT'S NOT FROM HOLLY.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.469
OOH.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.471
WOW. OKAY. WELL, IF
HOLLY FINDS OUT,

13:58.505 --> 14:01.975
YOU'D BETTER GET IN THE BOYFRIEND
PROTECTION PROGRAM, BROTHER.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.879
SO WHO'S THE LOVELY LITTLE
LADY WHO WOULDN'T LET GO?

14:05.913 --> 14:08.381
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.550
UNDERSTOOD. ALL RIGHT.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.819
WHY DON'T YOU WEAR A
TURTLENECK, YOU KNOW?

14:12.852 --> 14:15.889
OR, UM, GET A BODYGUARD?

14:15.923 --> 14:17.557
DINNER'S READY.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.897
UGH!

14:27.935 --> 14:30.370
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE
PASS THE SALT?

14:30.403 --> 14:33.306
WHY, DOES MUELLER LIKE IT SALTY?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.543
I THINK I KNOW HOW
I LIKE MY FOOD

14:36.576 --> 14:38.478
AND WHERE I LIKE TO EAT IT,
AND THAT'S NOT WITH YOU.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.047
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE
MY DINNER TO GO.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.582
I'M TAKING MY FOOD TO GO FIRST.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.389
SO AFTER THE WHOLE
FINANCIAL SCANDAL,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.191
EVERYONE TREATED
ME LIKE AN OUTCAST

14:51.224 --> 14:52.960
AND I COULDN'T GET
A JOB ANYWHERE.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.462
SO THEN I MET MEL, AND SHE TOOK
ME IN HERE AND GAVE ME THIS JOB.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.298
AND I'VE BEEN HERE EVER SINCE.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.633
You see, Elena,
I'm not currently

15:00.667 --> 15:03.470
exactly the high-powered executive
that you thought I was.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.273
So, look, if you want to hang up right
now, I would totally understand.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.242
What? No no no. I'm... I'm moved

15:09.276 --> 15:11.911
that you share this
truthfulness with me, Joseph.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.181
I wish I could share more.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.049
YOU KNOW WHAT I WISH?

15:16.083 --> 15:18.051
THAT I WAS LYING
RIGHT BESIDE YOU.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.620
DAMN, LADY, YOU ARE
KILLING ME RIGHT NOW.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.590
THAT IS AMERICAN
IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.458
YEAH.

15:25.492 --> 15:28.061
YEAH, IT MEANS, "WHY
DO YOU HAVE TO BE

15:28.095 --> 15:31.031
SO INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL
AND SO FAR AWAY?"

15:31.064 --> 15:33.466
Mel: JOE, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

15:33.500 --> 15:36.103
SPEAKING OF KILLING
ME RIGHT NOW,

15:36.136 --> 15:38.271
THAT'S MEL. LET ME CALL
YOU RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

15:38.305 --> 15:41.074
( knocking on door )

15:41.108 --> 15:43.343
HEY, SORRY, I SAW YOUR
LIGHT ON UNDER THE DOOR.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.646
AND TO YOU THAT'S THE UNIVERSAL
SIGN TO PLEASE BARGE RIGHT IN?

15:46.679 --> 15:48.548
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE CANDLES
AND THE CHAMPAGNE?

15:48.581 --> 15:51.584
ARE YOU ABOUT TO GET
LUCKY WITH YOURSELF?

15:51.618 --> 15:54.187
YEAH, YOU KNOW, BUT IF I RUSH
RIGHT INTO IT, I FEEL CHEAP.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.089
PLUS IF I BUY MYSELF DINNER,
I'M A LOT MORE FUN.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.590
SO WHAT DID YOU DO...

15:57.624 --> 15:59.392
JUST COME UP HERE TO
ANNOY THE CRAP OUT OF ME

15:59.426 --> 16:01.294
OR DID YOU ACTUALLY
NEED SOMETHING?

16:01.328 --> 16:03.296
OH, I REALLY MESSED
THINGS UP WITH LENNOX.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.964
BUT I WASN'T WRONG.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.966
SEEING CAMERON HAS
TOTALLY CORRUPTED HER.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.637
MEL, YOU CANNOT ALWAYS TRY TO
CONTROL THINGS, ALL RIGHT?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.140
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T TELL SOMEONE
THAT THEY CAN'T FALL IN LOVE

16:13.173 --> 16:15.142
- WITH SOMEBODY THAT THEY WORK WITH.
- LOVE?

16:15.175 --> 16:16.709
WHATEVER IT IS.
LOOK, THE POINT IS,

16:16.743 --> 16:19.212
YOU KNOW... I MEAN, IF YOU'RE
LUCKY ENOUGH IN THIS LIFE

16:19.246 --> 16:20.713
TO MAKE A CONNECTION
WITH SOMEBODY,

16:20.747 --> 16:23.016
DON'T YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF
TO SEE IF IT'S FOR REAL?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.951
AS HARD AS THIS MAY BE
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE,

16:24.984 --> 16:28.221
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN FALL FOR SOMEONE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF A POLITICAL ISSUE...

16:28.255 --> 16:30.657
OR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
WORLD, FOR THAT MATTER.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.992
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THIS
WHOLE INTERNSHIP THING

16:33.026 --> 16:35.562
WOULD LEAD TO SOME MAJOR
AUNT-NIECE BONDING.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.498
LIKE WE WERE GOING TO
DISH ABOUT LEGISLATION

16:38.531 --> 16:40.700
AND SWITCH OUTFITS AND
SEE IF ANYONE NOTICES.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.236
BUT NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING.
SHE'S TOTALLY REJECTED ME.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.738
SHE HASN'T REJECTED YOU. SHE'S
JUST DISAGREEING WITH YOU.

16:45.772 --> 16:50.009
LOOK, LENNOX IS SMART
AND INDEPENDENT

16:50.043 --> 16:52.345
AND FIGHTS FOR WHAT
SHE BELIEVES IN.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.047
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THAT MAKES HER?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.383
A BIG PAIN IN THE ASS.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.052
YEAH. SHE IS MINI YOU.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.454
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT!

17:01.488 --> 17:03.756
AH! SHE IS A MINI ME.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.492
I WILL LIVE FOREVER.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.760
AW! OH MY GOSH I
TOTALLY MISREAD HER.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.496
I GOTTA GO TALK TO
LENNOX RIGHT NOW.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.464
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.067
YEAH, WELL, THIS HAS TO BE SAID.
I WILL LEAVE YOU

17:14.101 --> 17:16.069
TO YOUR MENAGE-A-JOE.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.607
LENNOX, WAKE UP.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.410
WHAT'S GOING ON? IS THERE
SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY?

17:23.443 --> 17:26.079
YES... AN US EMERGENCY.

17:26.113 --> 17:29.216
OKAY, WELL, UNLESS ONE
OF US IS ON FIRE,

17:29.249 --> 17:31.518
I'M STILL NOT TALKING TO YOU.
GOOD NIGHT.

17:31.551 --> 17:35.522
NO, COME ON. UNTIL I GET THIS OFF
MY CHEST, I CAN'T GO BACK TO SLEEP.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.725
THEN I GUESS I CAN'T EITHER.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.027
OKAY, LOOK, I THOUGHT
THIS WHOLE THING

17:41.060 --> 17:45.332
WAS ABOUT YOU AND CAMERON
AND POLITICS AND LOYALTY.

17:45.365 --> 17:49.269
BUT IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT
ME LETTING YOU BE WHO YOU ARE,

17:49.302 --> 17:51.171
NOT WHO I WANT YOU TO BE.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.274
PLEASE COME BACK
TO WORK WITH ME.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.443
WHAT IF I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU?
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF THE THOUGHTS

17:56.476 --> 17:59.045
THAT COME OUT OF MY BRAIN DISAGREE WITH
THE THOUGHTS THAT COME OUT OF YOUR BRAIN?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.447
THAT'D BE FANTASTIC.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.483
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN TOO OFTEN, OR PUBLICLY.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.085
REMEMBER, ME BOSS, YOU INTERN.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.687
FAIR ENOUGH.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.157
NOW ABOUT CAMERON...

18:10.190 --> 18:12.525
I HEREBY GIVE YOU
PERMISSION TO SEE HIM.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.760
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.662
NO, I DO. I WAS WRONG.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.664
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN,
BUT WHEN IT DOES,

18:17.697 --> 18:20.133
I AM BIG ENOUGH TO
ACKNOWLEDGE IT.

18:20.167 --> 18:23.203
THAT'S GREAT, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO SEE HIM ANYMORE.

18:23.236 --> 18:26.273
WHAT? BUT I WAS JUST SO BIG RIGHT THEN.
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:26.306 --> 18:30.109
I DON'T NEED A REASON.
HE'S JUST "EH."

18:30.143 --> 18:33.146
BEEN THERE. "EH" IS THE WORST.

18:33.180 --> 18:36.216
IT'S SO TRUE. YOU
REALLY ARE MY MINI ME.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.550
OH, GET OFF ME.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.386
OH, IT'S LIKE HUGGING MYSELF!

18:39.419 --> 18:41.154
OW, YOU'RE ON MY HAIR.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.356
OH, I HATE THAT TOO.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.460
- ( laughing )
- Joey: HEY.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.128
HOW WAS THE TOLEDO STREET SCENE?

18:49.162 --> 18:51.231
BUSY SERVING ME...

18:51.264 --> 18:54.634
FRIED ZUCCHINI, FRIED
JALAPENOS, FRIED PICKLES.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.804
- JEEZ, MEL.
- WHAT? THEY'RE ALL VEGETABLES.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.407
YEAH, DEEP-FRIED AND
TOTALLY DISGUSTING.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.108
UH, YOU MEAN DELICIOUS.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.843
I THINK I KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.412
WELL, YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO YOUR OPINION,

19:05.445 --> 19:07.480
EVEN IF IT'S WRONG, DUMMY HEAD.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.483
YOU'RE WRONG, STUPID PANTS.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.652
Joey: GETTING BACK TO
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

19:12.685 --> 19:14.287
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL ALL OF US, RYDER,

19:14.321 --> 19:15.855
