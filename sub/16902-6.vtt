WEBVTT

00:05.071 --> 00:07.540
Merry almost Christmas, everybody.

00:07.540 --> 00:10.510
I have some great news. We are all getting--

00:10.510 --> 00:11.578
Frozen steaks!

00:11.578 --> 00:12.579
iPod Nothings!

00:12.579 --> 00:13.613
Colorful sweaters!

00:13.613 --> 00:14.848
Nope. Better.

00:14.848 --> 00:20.053
We are getting to participate in a
charity program called "Letters to Santa".

00:21.121 --> 00:22.322
No, this is great.

00:22.322 --> 00:25.625
The Post Office collects letters
that poor children write to Santa

00:25.625 --> 00:27.961
and then we go buy them what they ask for.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.663
Look, we already did our
Christmas charity work.

00:30.663 --> 00:33.063
Everybody here chipped in to get Sue a bra.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.001
Nice!

00:35.001 --> 00:36.636
Much better!
- Sweet!

00:36.636 --> 00:38.905
Come on, nobody but me's gonna do this?

00:38.905 --> 00:40.940
Well, I for one
think it's a great idea

00:40.940 --> 00:42.876
because Christmas is a time of giving.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.877
Ugh!

00:43.877 --> 00:44.944
Are you drunk?

00:44.944 --> 00:46.479
On "The Spirit of Christmas".

00:46.479 --> 00:48.815
It's this cheap, high-proof brandy I found.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.917
I hope it's not seasonal.

00:50.917 --> 00:54.387
I'll take one, Miss Lemon.
I love helping people less fortunate than me.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.755
Where do you find them?

00:55.755 --> 00:57.690
There are these Nigerians
on the internet that help me.

00:57.690 --> 01:02.162
Listen to this.
"Dear Santa, my name is Chanel Jenkins.

01:02.162 --> 01:06.066
I would like some new shoes
so I can walk to school.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.868
My dream is to be a doctor someday --"

01:10.837 --> 01:13.406
That kid's never gonna be a doctor.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.208
Better buy it a jet ski.

01:16.342 --> 01:19.106
This is what the holidays are all about.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.183
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:25.418 --> 01:26.486
Hello?

01:26.486 --> 01:27.887
I'm free, Lemon.

01:27.887 --> 01:29.689
Where are you? I hear sunshine.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.859
I ducked down to Florida for a
surprise early Christmas.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.994
I showed up three days early,
showered my mom with gifts.

01:34.994 --> 01:37.630
She called them all adequate.
It's a Christmas miracle!

01:37.630 --> 01:40.433
Well, I'm glad to hear it went well.
Tell Colleen I said hi.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.936
I wish I could but she's out for her morning walk.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.437
And I'm off to have a real Christmas.

01:44.437 --> 01:49.609
Fly to Rio, tan in the nude,
bet on some monkey wrestling.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.146
Just like Norman Rockwell always drew it.
Well, have a good flight.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.914
I could fly there without a plane.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.193 --> 02:09.024
Mother!

02:31.050 --> 02:35.288
Hey, Toofer, can I buy a kid FUBU?
Is that a swear word?

02:35.288 --> 02:38.791
Okay, while FUBU is not in itself profane,
I do think that--

02:38.791 --> 02:39.985
Thank you.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.260
Lemon --

02:42.829 --> 02:44.597
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in Rio?

02:44.597 --> 02:48.868
I hit her. Colleen. I hit her with my car.

02:48.868 --> 02:50.870
What?! Oh my God! Is she --

02:50.870 --> 02:53.139
She's fine. She's better than fine.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.664
They're giving her a titanium hip.
Like the Terminator.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.311
It's only going to make her more powerful!

02:58.311 --> 02:59.345
Well, are you okay?

02:59.345 --> 03:03.149
How can I be? She's here, now, in my home.

03:03.149 --> 03:06.686
Some quack doctor strongly
recommended she be around family.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.888
Oh, ho, oh, and Colleen didn't miss that one.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.560
Yes, mother...

03:13.560 --> 03:18.364
Well, why don't you try taking one of the
many blankets off you if you're feeling hot.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.968
Yes, I know. It is hard. Life is hard.

03:21.968 --> 03:25.062
No I wasn't! I was just scratching my head.
What!

03:25.471 --> 03:27.574
If you need something
just call down to the doorman.

03:27.574 --> 03:30.910
Yes, he does speak English, mother.
Jamaican people speak Eng--

03:30.910 --> 03:33.310
She hung up.

03:34.647 --> 03:38.084
I had to cancel my trip.
There's nothing going on at work.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.286
Everyone I know is away for the holidays.

03:40.286 --> 03:44.357
It's just me and Colleen. All alone.

03:44.357 --> 03:49.996
Lemon, one of her suitcases was just wigs.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.299
Look, I'm not doing my usual thing
either this year.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.735
Do you want me to come over later,
and say hi to your mom?

03:55.735 --> 03:57.070
Would you, please?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.239
Yeah, sure. I'll entertain her.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.741
You know, I was just thinking
in the shower this morning,

04:01.741 --> 04:04.344
what if Saint Nick was Nic Cage?

04:04.344 --> 04:07.280
'Cause it might go, a little something, like this--

04:07.280 --> 04:10.545
Toofer! Toofer, my man! How's tricks?

04:11.184 --> 04:12.776
Ho, ho, ho...

04:13.686 --> 04:15.119
Nah, that sounds more like Joan Rivers.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.362
Hey are you almost done?
We need to get out of here --

04:22.362 --> 04:24.564
-- before someone recognizes me.

04:24.564 --> 04:28.568
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just have to get
stocking stuffers. And stockings!

04:28.568 --> 04:29.669
Wait, what is all of this?

04:29.669 --> 04:32.639
You have video games in here,
and sports equipment, a T.V.!

04:32.639 --> 04:36.476
We-- I just want to make sure that DeShante,
age nine, and Marcus, age five,

04:36.476 --> 04:37.810
have a wonderful Christmas.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.879
Are you really gonna wrap all these presents?

04:39.879 --> 04:43.583
Of course I'm going to wrap them,
because that's what you do on Christmas.

04:43.583 --> 04:47.487
What you don't do is call your daughter
on December 22nd

04:47.487 --> 04:50.590
and tell her that you don't really feel
that you're up to hosting Christmas this year

04:50.590 --> 04:55.762
because she's 38 and you thought that
she'd have her "own family" by now.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.865
And that instead, you're going to a
couples-only retreat in Arizona,

04:58.865 --> 05:01.200
the theme of which is "Sexy at 70".

05:01.200 --> 05:02.235
Oh, no.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.238
Liz, you've never missed Christmas
with your family.

05:05.238 --> 05:09.008
I know. But I have a new family, the Glovers.

05:09.008 --> 05:12.845
And I am getting them all these
rapping Santas!

05:14.347 --> 05:17.917
Oh, oh well. I kind of assumed they would rap

05:17.917 --> 05:20.987
which is racist on my part,
but still, best Christmas ever!

05:20.987 --> 05:22.215
You're welcome, Glovers.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.563
Mother, what is so urgent that you
could not wait until

05:30.563 --> 05:32.031
I came back from the front door?

05:32.031 --> 05:33.866
I need my other bell!

05:33.866 --> 05:35.356
We agreed. One by the bed --

05:36.235 --> 05:37.202
-- and one by the toilet.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.039
Hello.

05:40.039 --> 05:43.576
Oh Liz... hello there.

05:43.576 --> 05:46.012
So good of you to come see me.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.147
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Donaghy.

05:48.147 --> 05:50.350
Oh, Liz, I'm so glad you're here.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.586
I want you to know and believe

05:53.586 --> 05:56.489
that what happened to me in Florida

05:56.489 --> 05:57.490
was an accident.

05:57.490 --> 06:01.561
My son, Jackie,
did not run me over on purpose.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.995
Case closed.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.932
And I don't want to hear another word about it.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.235
Mother, of course it was an accident,
no one is saying otherwise.

06:09.235 --> 06:13.072
The real tragedy is that the accident
broke of course,

06:13.072 --> 06:15.074
the Cartier watch

06:15.074 --> 06:17.343
that Jackie gave me early
this year for Christmas.

06:17.343 --> 06:18.544
Ho, ho, ho.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.180
It's not a Cartier, it's Chopard.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.817
Yes, of course, Chopard.
Not the Cartier watch

06:24.817 --> 06:26.819
that I wanted.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.014
Uh, Liz, uh, could I speak with you
for a second, please?

06:32.759 --> 06:33.760
I can't do this.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.928
I know, it's stressful.
The holidays are always stressful.

06:35.928 --> 06:36.963
It's not just that.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.831
Well, you're mother's hurt, and you love her.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.867
Do I? Do I, Lemon?

06:40.867 --> 06:42.168
I waited eight minutes.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.202
What?

06:43.202 --> 06:46.330
After I hit her, before I called 9-1-1
I sat in my car for eight minutes.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.813
What kind of son does that to his mother?

06:53.813 --> 06:54.914
Jack, you were in shock.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.383
You froze. It happens.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.185
It was an accident.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.618
It was an accident, right?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.688
Hey!

07:02.688 --> 07:05.657
What are you two girls whispering about?!

07:09.262 --> 07:10.530
What are you all still doing here?

07:10.530 --> 07:13.433
Lutz looked it up, but if we stay until noon,
it counts as a work week.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.035
And NBC has to pay
for our cabs to the airport.

07:16.035 --> 07:19.172
Tracy, you made $300 million this year.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.198
And I'm not going
anywhere for Christmas.

07:22.809 --> 07:25.244
Miss Lemon,
you really outdid yourself.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.913
Those are gonna be the happiest poor kids

07:26.913 --> 07:29.182
since my brother and I
went to Neverland Ranch.

07:29.182 --> 07:32.552
She went overboard because her family's
not exchanging gifts this year.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.555
Holy Buddha, who likes Christmas?

07:35.555 --> 07:37.256
It's gonna cost you a fortune to ship all this.

07:37.256 --> 07:38.891
Oh, no, I'm takin' it up there personally.

07:38.891 --> 07:42.088
I want to see DeShante and Marcus' faces
light up when they get it.

07:42.728 --> 07:47.934
Anyway, I gotta take this up to 245th Street
and Lawrence Taylor Boulevard.

07:47.934 --> 07:51.571
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.006
I will not not let you go
into that neighborhood alone.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.875
In the spirit of Christmas and Kwanzo --

07:55.875 --> 07:56.909
Kwanzaa.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.645
And Shalam-Shizzam to you too, my Sister.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.713
We'll go with you uptown.

08:00.713 --> 08:05.885
And remember, Dot Com, you are there
to protect me, and not Liz Lemon.

08:05.885 --> 08:11.691
Guys, we are outta here in five,
four, three, two...

08:11.691 --> 08:12.680
Exciting news, everyone.

08:13.426 --> 08:18.125
We are going to put on a live
Christmas Eve Special this year!

08:19.131 --> 08:21.100
This year as in tomorrow this year?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.168
Yes, that's right.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.500
Sadly, it will mean working a lot
of hours over the next couple days.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.369
Being away from our loved ones, our mothers --

08:28.975 --> 08:32.611
But we will be part of giving America
the perfect Christmas Eve

08:32.611 --> 08:34.135
It's going to be so worth it!
Now...

08:34.714 --> 08:37.046
Brainstorming session!
Go!

08:37.416 --> 08:40.010
I don't want to do this.

08:41.787 --> 08:45.382
Mr. Donaghy, as leader of this group,
I have to put my foot down.

08:45.691 --> 08:49.428
Christmas is a sacred time for me
and my surrogate family.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.665
So if you're willing to look four
25-year-old gay guys in the eyes

08:52.665 --> 08:56.202
and tell them that we're not going to see
New Kids on The Block at The Borgata,

08:56.202 --> 08:57.236
be my guest.

08:57.236 --> 09:00.106
You are all contractually obligated to participate.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.006
Yes, sir. I never liked that group. Sorry.

09:04.343 --> 09:08.180
Jack, this isn't fair.
Don't take your mommy issues out on us.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.249
I'm sorry, Lemon,
I'm just tryin' to get through Christmas.

09:10.249 --> 09:11.350
And then what?

09:11.350 --> 09:12.752
I found a nursing home off the coast of Maine

09:12.752 --> 09:15.321
run by the same French company
that oversaw Napoleon's exile.

09:15.321 --> 09:18.119
She will be treated humanely
but there will be no escape.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.725
Merry Christmas!

09:27.967 --> 09:29.869
Thank you so much
for carrying that,

09:29.869 --> 09:31.537
I will buy you
guys dinner later.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.266
Liz, we both have girlfriends.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.236
This is it, 4-D.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.506
Tracy, I am gonna need you to take a picture.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.548
You just push the little button on top.

09:42.548 --> 09:45.540
Thanks a lot. I never operated a camera before.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.279
I'm serious, that was very helpful.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.723
Oh... Make sure you get the hug.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.828
Oh... Hi.

09:55.828 --> 09:59.231
I brought these presents as part of
the "Letters to Santa" program --

10:00.833 --> 10:01.901
What just happened?

10:01.901 --> 10:04.503
What is the past tense of "scam"?
Is it scrumped?

10:04.503 --> 10:06.835
Liz Lemon, I think you just got scrumped.

10:08.507 --> 10:11.344
Donaghy wants a Santa costume and a Mrs. Claus.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.612
One, two, three, four, five.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.649
# J-j-j-j-jingle bell,
J-j-j-j-jingle bell all the way?

10:16.649 --> 10:18.184
# And a one horse open sleigh!?

10:18.184 --> 10:21.053
No! Alfonso, I'm on the six, you're on the four.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.555
Come on.
One, two, three, four, five.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.625
# J-j-j-j-jingle bell,
J-j-j-j-jingle bell all the way?

10:25.625 --> 10:29.288
Ah, my little elves at work.
Looking good, gang, looking good.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.029
Oh...

10:33.232 --> 10:35.534
You do realize we're going
into quadruple overtime.

10:35.534 --> 10:39.005
So what? We're giving America
the perfect Christmas, Pete.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.700
There are kids out there who never get that.

10:41.507 --> 10:42.474
I know I didn't.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.869
Not with Colleen around.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.947
My dad was long gone so every Christmas,

10:47.947 --> 10:50.916
Colleen would bring her "friend"
Mr. Schwarz over for dinner

10:50.916 --> 10:53.653
and she'd make me play songs on the
piano when she would sing to him.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.154
My parents divorced when I was nine --

10:55.154 --> 10:56.689
Every year the dreadful moment arrived

10:56.689 --> 10:59.592
when I would catch Mr. Schwarz
caressing my mother's bony thigh.

10:59.592 --> 11:03.396
And I'd say, "Eyes on the keys, Jackie Boy.
Keep your eyes on the keys..."

11:03.396 --> 11:04.864
And they'd ask me to play "White Christmas"

11:04.864 --> 11:07.958
and it would turn into some
boozy, burlesque travesty!

11:08.768 --> 11:10.429
Every time I hear that song I get aroused.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.805
What is wrong with me?

11:12.805 --> 11:16.208
I have to go to the prop meeting, now.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.766
She's the reason, she's why it happened.

11:19.578 --> 11:20.943
So the overtime...?

11:21.914 --> 11:22.881
Approved!

11:23.449 --> 11:24.416
Ah!

11:24.717 --> 11:25.684
It's Christmas!

11:28.821 --> 11:29.822
Next.

11:29.822 --> 11:34.960
Yes. Finally. Hi. I would like to speak to
whoever screens the "Letters to Santa".

11:34.960 --> 11:36.655
Then you better talk to that box.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.899
We-uh, maybe you can help me -- Trené.

11:39.899 --> 11:40.900
Irene.

11:40.900 --> 11:46.405
Irene, I believe that I was the victim of a scam
perpetrated through the mails. So...

11:46.405 --> 11:47.440
There's nothing we can do about that.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.242
I disagree, I think there are
a lot of things we could do.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.345
I would like to access any census information
you have for this address.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.380
No.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.816
In addition, I would like to speak
to the letter carrier...

11:56.816 --> 11:58.350
You know we're closin' in five minutes, right?

11:58.350 --> 12:00.086
Who services this zip, plus four.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.519
Never gonna happen.

12:02.321 --> 12:03.989
Can you help me out with her?

12:03.989 --> 12:07.823
Oh, really? We're both black
so we must know each other --

12:08.461 --> 12:10.096
Hey, Irene!

12:10.096 --> 12:11.397
Hey, Tracy!

12:11.397 --> 12:12.932
Did Vicki hook you up with this job?

12:12.932 --> 12:14.133
Yes...

12:14.133 --> 12:15.930
Oh, girl, you better stop.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.171
Hey, you don't know the
Postmaster General do you?

12:19.171 --> 12:22.108
I do, but we had a falling out
over the Jerry Garcia stamp.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.941
I mean, if I want to lick a hippie I'll just
return Joan Baez's phone calls.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.612
Are you wearing the same clothes as yesterday?

12:28.013 --> 12:29.674
I have no choice. I can't go home.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.584
Come on, you can go home --

12:31.584 --> 12:34.280
No. I can't. Last night we had...

12:35.454 --> 12:36.443
an incident.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.750
Jackie, sweetheart,

12:40.025 --> 12:44.263
can you get this heavy, wool blanket
out from underneath me?

12:44.263 --> 12:46.288
I'm sweating like a grape picker.

12:48.067 --> 12:52.561
Come on, put some back into it,
Jacqueline. Ha ha.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.838
My other hip!

12:56.208 --> 12:58.574
I think it was subconscious...
I've had enough.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.347
Fifty years of criticism and
feelings of inadequacy.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.582
Fifty ruined Christmases. I want to be free.

13:03.582 --> 13:04.617
What are you saying?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.018
I can't be alone with her.

13:06.018 --> 13:09.021
You see, Lemon, my mother is a virus
and my body is trying to get rid of her.

13:09.021 --> 13:11.257
Good God, she can't know
I'm having these thoughts.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.591
She can't know about the eight minutes.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.616
If she knew, she'd have me arrested,
she's done it before!

13:15.227 --> 13:17.127
Hey, the candy canes are for the show.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.634
Oh, so how'd it go uptown, Miss Lemon?

13:21.634 --> 13:22.635
I'll tell you how it went.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.171
I filed a report with the Better Business Bureau.

13:25.171 --> 13:29.699
I'm not going to rest until the
"Letters to Santa" program is shut down.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.578
What is wrong with you?

13:32.578 --> 13:35.047
You are being a real Scrooge!

13:35.047 --> 13:36.849
It was just two dudes, Kenneth.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.885
They scammed me and now they're
selling that stuff on eBay.

13:39.885 --> 13:44.824
There were no kids up there and there
definitely weren't any hugs around here.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.959
Well, if all you want is a hug from a black person

13:46.959 --> 13:49.860
maybe you should just host "The Price is Right."

13:49.995 --> 13:52.865
I don't believe people would do that,
Miss Lemon.

13:52.865 --> 13:56.936
This is a religious holiday,
when has religion ever caused any trouble?

13:56.936 --> 13:58.704
Kenneth, you're naïve.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.070
And you're acting like a real C word right now.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.405
That's right, a Cranky Sue.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.113
I know in my heart
that children got those presents.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.683
They didn't, Kenneth.
I'll prove it to you.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.516
It's dinner break.
Tracy, we're going uptown.

14:14.453 --> 14:18.514
All right, I'll call Grizz and Dotcom.
I'm sure they're not doin' anything.

14:19.592 --> 14:27.431
No. Dr. Williams said, "boundaries."

14:32.605 --> 14:35.574
Oh, mother, you shouldn't be
exerting yourself like that.

14:35.574 --> 14:39.879
I'm sorry that work has kept me
from spending more time with you.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.346
What kind of time, Jackie?

14:42.281 --> 14:44.442
Eight minutes? Maybe?

14:45.217 --> 14:47.586
John Francis Donaghy...

14:47.586 --> 14:51.056
How could you? How could you?

14:51.056 --> 14:54.326
Waiting eight minutes to call 9-1-1.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.361
I can't believe it!

14:55.361 --> 14:56.629
I don't know what you're talking about, mother,

14:56.629 --> 14:57.687
and I've got to get back to work now.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.253
Exhibit A!

15:01.600 --> 15:02.999
Your cell phone bill.

15:03.435 --> 15:06.906
16 AM.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.032
Exhibit B!

15:08.674 --> 15:11.644
The watch that my son gave me
for Christmas,

15:11.644 --> 15:13.305
not the one I wanted by the way!

15:13.712 --> 15:17.116
You had just set it before it broke of course!

15:17.116 --> 15:19.785
When your car rammed into me down in Florida.

15:19.785 --> 15:23.789
And it stopped at 8:08!

15:23.789 --> 15:25.518
Exhibit C!

15:25.958 --> 15:28.894
Sixteen minus eight is eight!

15:28.894 --> 15:32.022
Numbers, unlike children, don't lie!

15:32.364 --> 15:34.199
What kind of son --

15:34.199 --> 15:35.434
What kind of mother tells her son that

15:35.434 --> 15:37.959
John Kennedy died because he talked in church?

15:38.337 --> 15:40.739
Or tells her son when he's
voted captain of the diving team,

15:40.739 --> 15:43.042
quote, "What a great way to meet guys"?

15:43.042 --> 15:44.043
Oh!

15:44.043 --> 15:46.378
Or invites strange men over
on Christmas Eve?!

15:46.378 --> 15:50.582
Don't turn this around, Jackie!
Don't make this about me!

15:50.582 --> 15:52.851
It's always about you!

15:52.851 --> 15:54.586
I am 50 years old.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.689
You have ruined every Christmas I've ever had

15:56.689 --> 15:58.724
and I'm not letting you take
this one down too!

15:58.724 --> 16:00.859
You're walking away from me!

16:00.859 --> 16:02.793
More snow machines!

16:05.664 --> 16:09.234
You see Kenneth, those drawings are
a clue that children live here.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.326
Lebowsky out.

16:11.103 --> 16:14.163
This bare door is a scam door.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.039
No. Children live here, I know it.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.006
Get ready to have your little bubble burst.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.676
Come on, Christmas...
Come on, Christmas...

16:23.615 --> 16:24.604
Hello?

16:27.052 --> 16:30.180
Oh, my gosh,
are you DeShante and Marcus?

16:31.290 --> 16:33.758
And you got the presents?
There are presents under the tree?

16:34.660 --> 16:37.262
I did that! I got that stuff for you!

16:37.262 --> 16:39.560
I'm the one who made Christmas happen!

16:39.732 --> 16:41.467
What about Santa?!

16:41.467 --> 16:45.170
Daddy, she said there's no Santa Claus!

16:45.170 --> 16:46.238
What is wrong with you?!

16:46.238 --> 16:48.774
No, I, it's a, I did a good thing.
I got the letter from--

16:48.774 --> 16:51.910
Yeah, the letter that said "Dear Santa,"
not "Dear Lonely White Lady."

16:51.910 --> 16:52.911
I'm sorry.

16:52.911 --> 16:58.679
Could I offer you tickets to a live Christmas
special in the tradition of Andy Williams.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.019
Okay, you were right.
So, yeah, you were right.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.529
Do you know your mother is here?

17:10.529 --> 17:12.830
I don't care.
I'm trying to produce a Christmas special

17:12.830 --> 17:14.662
that makes "It's a Wonderful Life"
look like "Pulp Fiction."

17:14.933 --> 17:18.069
Where the hell is Mrs. Claus,
you can't do Christmas Eve without her.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.405
What is wrong with you people?!

17:19.405 --> 17:20.939
We're on in 30 seconds.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.007
How can we not have Mrs. Claus?

17:22.007 --> 17:24.406
I didn't realize you were serious
about that so I cut it --

17:24.877 --> 17:26.678
You can't cut Mrs. Claus!

17:26.678 --> 17:29.915
Everyone knows that on Christmas Eve
Mrs. Claus hangs your stockings

17:29.915 --> 17:31.583
and then puts out food for Santa.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.177
Then you sing songs around the piano
until she tucks you in.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.455
Did your mother not do that?

17:36.455 --> 17:38.824
That's not a thing, Jack.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.225
Yes, it is.

17:40.225 --> 17:43.695
No, Mrs. Claus must have been
something special that Colleen did.

17:43.695 --> 17:46.065
Probably to make up for the fact
that your dad wasn't around.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.567
No, Christmas in the Donaghy house was awful.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.770
Have I not told you
about my mom's Yuletide boyfriend,

17:51.770 --> 17:54.740
good old Frederick August Otto Schwarz III?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.909
F.A.O. Schwartz, like the toy store?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.742
His family owned some toy stores. Yes, so what?

18:00.879 --> 18:05.213
Jack, I think your mother "put out" on
Christmas to get you kids presents.

18:05.517 --> 18:06.685
She did it for you.

18:06.685 --> 18:09.279
Not possible. She didn't do anything for us.

18:09.855 --> 18:13.154
I know you guys were pretty poor.
Did you have a lot of presents?

18:14.359 --> 18:16.195
You couldn't even see the tree!

18:16.195 --> 18:19.130
In five, four, three...

18:19.832 --> 18:25.104
Our first guest has sung with everyone
from Paul Anka to Crocodile Dundee.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.332
Cross the piano!

18:27.039 --> 18:31.376
Ladies and gentlemen, Jenna Maroney!

18:34.179 --> 18:39.685
# Chestnuts roasting on an open fire?

18:39.685 --> 18:45.419
# Jack Frost nipping at your nose?

18:46.458 --> 18:51.396
# Yuletide carols being sung by a choir?

18:51.396 --> 18:56.602
# And folks dressed up like eskimos?

18:56.602 --> 19:03.175
# Everybody knows a turkey
and some mistle toe?

19:03.175 --> 19:06.912
Liz Lemon, I know you're going to be
all alone on Christmas Day.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.815
So if you'd like...
you can spend it with the Jordans.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.350
I'd love to, Tracy.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.385
Good. We'll be over at 2:00.

19:13.385 --> 19:14.853
My kids have a peanut allergy,

19:14.853 --> 19:16.878
but my dogs only eat steak.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.191
Okay.

19:20.759 --> 19:25.492
# They know that Santa's on his way?

19:30.769 --> 19:32.634
What on earth is the matter with you?

19:33.605 --> 19:35.941
I love you mother and I don't want you to die.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.375
I'm never going to, Jackie.

19:39.044 --> 19:45.005
# To see if reindeer really know how to fly?

19:51.957 --> 20:01.333
# And so I'm offering this simple phrase?

20:01.333 --> 20:09.841
# To kiss from one to 92?

20:09.841 --> 20:12.811
# Although it's been said?

20:12.811 --> 20:17.983
# Many times, many ways?

20:17.983 --> 20:21.587
# Merry Christmas?

20:21.587 --> 20:25.357
# Merry Christmas?

20:25.357 --> 20:38.670
# Merry Christmas to you?

20:38.670 --> 20:40.399
You're flat Jack.

20:41.305 --> 20:47.379
