00:01.569 --> 00:03.314
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:03.382 --> 00:05.715
Stop looking into Carter's disappearance

00:05.783 --> 00:08.105
or people you love will start to die.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.088
I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry, Sarah.

00:10.156 --> 00:12.860
You've spent 25 years
convinced Dad committed a murder

00:12.928 --> 00:14.374
that never even happened.

00:14.442 --> 00:15.961
Matthew Weitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney.

00:16.029 --> 00:18.276
What I am interested in is Tom Carter

00:18.344 --> 00:19.901
and what it all has to do with Mayfair.

00:19.969 --> 00:21.714
You think I want you getting closer to him?

00:21.784 --> 00:25.874
Do you have any idea how
hard it is to meet with you

00:25.942 --> 00:28.114
and not tell you that I love you?

00:29.210 --> 00:31.967
Today would have been my
one-year anniversary with David.

00:32.034 --> 00:34.327
The "Times" published
his last crossword puzzle.

00:34.395 --> 00:36.887
I feel like I keep getting
these messages from him.

00:36.955 --> 00:38.318
This was a mistake.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.592
We love it here.

00:39.660 --> 00:40.663
David, you're dead.

00:40.731 --> 00:42.115
Did you bring my crossword puzzle?

00:42.182 --> 00:44.530
Did you solve another tattoo?

00:48.850 --> 00:52.651
"Got One, Patterson." Wait.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.149
(David) Pretty clever, huh?

00:54.217 --> 00:55.992
Took me forever to work it in there.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.855
You solved one of the tattoos!

00:57.923 --> 01:00.647
That's... Which one?

01:00.752 --> 01:02.250
- Seriously?
- Oh, right.

01:02.318 --> 01:05.275
Of course, you don't know

01:05.343 --> 01:07.487
because I'm imagining you.

01:07.555 --> 01:09.208
Something sweet?

01:09.300 --> 01:11.232
Oh, I didn't order it.

01:12.026 --> 01:13.263
Oh.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.204
Uh... sorry.

01:19.943 --> 01:21.821
This sheep, do you have this

01:21.952 --> 01:23.104
on all of your desserts?

01:23.182 --> 01:24.992
No, Miss. It's especially for you.

01:25.060 --> 01:27.760
A gentleman with glasses
dropped it off some time ago.

01:27.835 --> 01:29.269
Enjoy.

01:33.216 --> 01:35.191
You organized a scavenger hunt.

01:35.259 --> 01:37.645
The crossword clues and...

01:37.755 --> 01:40.523
A piece from our favorite board game.

01:41.156 --> 01:44.351
David, when you solved a tattoo,

01:44.444 --> 01:45.270
you should have called me immediately.

01:45.369 --> 01:47.082
And we would have had
a two-second phone call

01:47.150 --> 01:49.011
instead of an adventure.

01:50.423 --> 01:53.473
You were supposed to
be here for all of this.

01:55.536 --> 01:58.812
- It was gonna be...
- Super romantic.

01:59.055 --> 02:01.269
These tattoos are very serious.

02:01.352 --> 02:03.412
- You can't...
- Hey, I'm aware, okay?

02:03.511 --> 02:06.116
And the last one I decoded
took down a Russian spy ring,

02:06.202 --> 02:09.382
so, you know, a little credit.

02:09.449 --> 02:11.337
This could be just as massive.

02:11.405 --> 02:13.521
Or bigger.

02:13.703 --> 02:15.713
I wouldn't rule out bigger.

02:20.410 --> 02:23.445
(both breathing heavily)

02:25.529 --> 02:27.020
That was, uh...

02:27.941 --> 02:29.360
Yeah.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.729
I should go.

02:36.994 --> 02:40.658
Yeah. Yeah, we probably should.

02:44.310 --> 02:46.872
(laughing) Stop. That tickles.

02:46.940 --> 02:48.474
- Does that tickle?
- Yes.

02:48.580 --> 02:49.780
Huh?

02:53.255 --> 02:55.123
(laughing)

02:56.180 --> 02:57.500
(phone trilling)

02:57.568 --> 02:58.220
Hold on.

02:58.288 --> 03:00.086
Oh! No!

03:00.846 --> 03:02.452
Oh, crap.

03:02.836 --> 03:04.871
- I have to go.
- No!

03:06.967 --> 03:08.103
Why?

03:08.171 --> 03:10.166
- Is it your boyfriend?
- (laughing)

03:10.234 --> 03:13.614
Yeah, he's 5'6", 250 pounds,

03:13.682 --> 03:16.532
armed and dangerous, but what can I say?

03:16.600 --> 03:17.940
He makes me laugh.

03:18.008 --> 03:21.316
Should be a fun night.
You can stick around.

03:21.384 --> 03:25.346
No. My dad is watching Sawyer.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.887
- He might need some company.
- Since when do you and your dad talk?

03:27.955 --> 03:31.642
Things have changed since... you know.

03:31.833 --> 03:34.862
We're having a family
dinner tomorrow night,

03:34.930 --> 03:37.641
celebrating little Sawyer
getting into the school play.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.425
He's playing a gallbladder.

03:39.759 --> 03:41.711
We're all very proud. (laughing)

03:41.779 --> 03:43.763
You wanna come?

03:44.183 --> 03:46.671
Ooh, inviting me to meet your dad.

03:46.739 --> 03:48.267
That's a big, big step.

03:48.335 --> 03:50.703
No, it's not. It's just dinner.

03:50.835 --> 03:52.523
- Oh, man.
- What?

03:52.601 --> 03:54.040
If I didn't have to leave...

03:54.108 --> 03:55.524
So don't.

03:55.592 --> 03:56.876
Uh-uh. Come here.

03:56.944 --> 03:58.642
No! Uhh! No!

03:58.710 --> 04:01.246
(intercom buzzing)

04:01.403 --> 04:02.736
Oh.

04:04.507 --> 04:05.472
I was asleep!

04:05.540 --> 04:07.806
I'm so sorry. I met you a few times.

04:07.874 --> 04:10.296
I dated David Wagner from 5C.

04:10.364 --> 04:12.107
You mean the kid that just died?

04:12.175 --> 04:14.723
Yes. Yeah, that's him.

04:14.791 --> 04:17.329
Listen, he left something in his apartment

04:17.397 --> 04:19.122
and it's really important that I get it.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.168
Absolutely not.

04:21.236 --> 04:23.850
Show him your badge.

04:23.918 --> 04:28.374
Well, what if I was FBI?

04:28.790 --> 04:30.714
You got a warrant?

04:30.926 --> 04:33.780
- Not yet, but...
- Get a warrant.

04:35.435 --> 04:37.536
Badge was probably a mistake.

04:39.068 --> 04:40.268
Yep.

04:41.088 --> 04:42.555
Thanks.

04:43.989 --> 04:47.073
What are you...? I need you to leave.

04:47.634 --> 04:49.707
Well, too bad. You don't
get to control everything.

04:49.775 --> 04:51.317
Please don't make this
harder than it has to be.

04:51.394 --> 04:54.403
Well, if it's so hard,
then why are you doing it?

04:55.195 --> 04:56.945
Look, I know this is about Kurt, okay?

04:57.013 --> 04:59.475
This has nothing to do with him.

04:59.543 --> 05:01.443
Then what is it?

05:06.396 --> 05:10.052
Please, just... go.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.919
- I know that you love me.
- No, I don't love you.

05:14.507 --> 05:16.808
How can I make that any clearer?

05:22.629 --> 05:25.731
(overlapping chatter)

05:33.940 --> 05:34.774
(speaking Chinese)

05:35.107 --> 05:38.735
Oh, good, you're a generous addict.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.134
- What are you doing here?
- Winning.

05:41.202 --> 05:43.669
That is not the word I'd use.

05:43.737 --> 05:46.417
Ah, I am a little short on cash.

05:46.524 --> 05:49.393
Um, what does this get me?

05:50.690 --> 05:51.557
(speaking Chinese)

05:51.710 --> 05:54.745
(Weitz) Oh, what? Oh, no.

05:57.764 --> 05:59.852
I'm just looking out for my partner.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.304
We're not partners.

06:01.372 --> 06:02.656
No? The deal's off?

06:02.751 --> 06:03.898
Oh, well, I guess I should

06:03.966 --> 06:06.646
just put the bracelets
on you, call it a night.

06:06.714 --> 06:10.011
I gave you everything I have on Carter.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.813
I know. I know you did,

06:11.881 --> 06:13.615
but I'm not interested in Carter anymore.

06:13.683 --> 06:16.362
The focus of the
investigation has shifted...

06:16.947 --> 06:18.590
to Mayfair.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.915
(jazz playing)

06:26.052 --> 06:27.890
I'd like to close out now, please.

06:27.961 --> 06:28.927
(Alexandra) Let go of me.

06:28.995 --> 06:30.812
(Dennis) At least finish
the bottle with me.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.899
Dennis, come on.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.087
It's a $2,000 bottle of wine.

06:34.155 --> 06:35.505
Leave her alone.

06:35.573 --> 06:36.663
Mind your own business.

06:36.731 --> 06:40.477
Let her go and walk away.

06:44.967 --> 06:45.751
Thank you.

06:45.819 --> 06:48.469
- You all right?
- Yeah.

06:50.985 --> 06:54.014
Hey, there's still like...

06:54.082 --> 06:57.059
$1,250 of wine left in here.

06:57.949 --> 06:59.884
Can I pour you a glass?

(groaning)

07:13.382 --> 07:15.623
You're a horrible influence.

07:15.746 --> 07:17.127
This was your idea.

07:17.195 --> 07:19.953
I wouldn't be here if you had just told me

07:20.021 --> 07:21.488
which tattoo you'd solved.

07:21.556 --> 07:22.671
That's no fun.

07:22.739 --> 07:23.966
Neither is this!

07:24.034 --> 07:26.182
But, I mean, this is a little fun.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.808
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

07:30.001 --> 07:31.395
Here we go.

08:34.477 --> 08:37.253
- (groaning)
- What are you doing?

08:37.780 --> 08:39.565
Are you crazy?

08:40.328 --> 08:42.011
Get off of there!

08:43.267 --> 08:45.074
Sorry. I would have helped, but...

08:45.076 --> 08:46.637
Whoa, are you gonna...?

08:46.639 --> 08:48.929
Yes. Yes, you are.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.336
Why didn't you tell me all
your stuff had been moved?

08:59.371 --> 09:01.100
I don't know anything you don't know.

09:01.157 --> 09:03.867
- (groaning)
- Wait, wait. Not so fast.

09:03.869 --> 09:07.022
David, look around. The clue is not here.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.192
You don't know that.

09:08.194 --> 09:09.461
(banging on door)

09:09.463 --> 09:11.216
Open up!

09:12.684 --> 09:13.461
We have to get out, David.

09:13.463 --> 09:17.326
Wait, wait. Think sheep.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.105
(banging on door)

09:20.233 --> 09:21.336
(super) Open up!

09:21.424 --> 09:23.661
David, the Agricola box is gone.

09:23.715 --> 09:24.854
All of your stuff has been moved.

09:24.909 --> 09:27.188
Okay, but in that game, what
do you do with the sheep?

09:27.220 --> 09:30.920
You cook the sheep in... the fireplace!

09:31.970 --> 09:34.439
(banging continues)

09:36.562 --> 09:38.296
Open up!

09:42.727 --> 09:44.150
Okay.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.606
"Carson Clock Company." What is this?

09:46.653 --> 09:47.450
Let's maybe not figure that out right here.

09:47.497 --> 09:49.253
Okay. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.136
(jazz playing)

09:56.204 --> 09:57.764
There's always that
one straight guy at work

09:57.824 --> 10:00.846
that thinks "You just
haven't met the right man."

10:00.956 --> 10:01.950
I had one of those.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.165
Oh, yeah? What did you do?

10:04.235 --> 10:05.393
I married him.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.980
(laughing) How long did that last?

10:08.073 --> 10:09.588
Too long.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.800
I wasn't...

10:13.689 --> 10:16.433
It took me a while to get here.

10:16.487 --> 10:18.722
Well, I'm glad you're here now.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.458
I'm in the city a lot nowadays...

10:26.711 --> 10:28.394
and I think that's probably the last time

10:28.396 --> 10:30.930
I'm gonna let Dennis buy me a drink.

10:31.737 --> 10:35.175
So I was thinking...

10:38.487 --> 10:40.788
- (ringtone chiming)
- There you go.

10:41.028 --> 10:43.085
Now you have mine, too.

10:44.408 --> 10:45.586
Alexandra.

10:45.677 --> 10:46.807
Bethany.

10:47.030 --> 10:48.554
Bethany...

10:49.648 --> 10:51.582
very nice to meet you.

10:52.738 --> 10:54.510
(Weitz) Mayfair's dirty.

10:54.622 --> 10:56.323
No, she's not.

10:56.325 --> 10:58.028
Oh, great, there's a PowerPoint.

10:58.030 --> 11:01.792
Exhibit A... Carter visits Mayfair
24 hours before Guerrero is killed.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.684
What if that meeting was
about finalizing his hit?

11:03.686 --> 11:04.333
And what if it wasn't?

11:04.335 --> 11:06.392
She was in the prison
when Guerrero got shanked!

11:06.394 --> 11:07.853
A federal prosecutor
should know the difference

11:07.901 --> 11:09.719
between correlation and causation.

11:09.721 --> 11:11.837
After Guerrero is killed,
Carter suddenly disappears,

11:11.839 --> 11:13.235
his car abandoned by a bridge.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.172
Everybody hated Carter, not just Mayfair.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.772
Huh, well, that doesn't
explain Sofia Varma.

11:17.774 --> 11:19.810
She and Mayfair were lovers
until, you guessed it,

11:19.892 --> 11:22.520
she commits suicide, her
car abandoned by a bridge.

11:22.593 --> 11:24.227
Sound familiar?

11:24.443 --> 11:27.591
Everybody Mayfair gets
close to winds up dead.

11:27.593 --> 11:29.563
And if you're as smart as you seem,

11:29.696 --> 11:31.828
I know you've had suspicions about her.

11:31.830 --> 11:33.767
I have suspicions about you.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.354
I know you're gunning
for a congressional seat.

11:36.356 --> 11:39.759
Come on, Harvard Law, federal clerkship,

11:39.761 --> 11:41.412
and a sudden passion for union meetings?

11:41.414 --> 11:42.553
It's pretty obvious.

11:42.555 --> 11:46.739
Just 'cause I'm ambitious doesn't mean
there's not corruption in your Bureau.

11:46.794 --> 11:49.379
And I am going to end it.

11:49.813 --> 11:53.155
So you need to choose
what side you wanna be on.

11:55.533 --> 11:59.319
(Patterson) Okay, so
what does this key unlock?

11:59.673 --> 12:04.272
Meet Stefan... the Great.

12:04.326 --> 12:06.748
Ah, an automaton.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.510
This must be the magic speakeasy
he always wanted to take me to.

12:09.577 --> 12:12.178
And he's over a hundred years old, so...

12:12.262 --> 12:14.063
unfortunately, he doesn't
really work anymore.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.528
But that is what your key is for.

12:15.530 --> 12:17.748
Wow, what did he used to do?

12:17.855 --> 12:19.455
Here, pick one.

12:20.374 --> 12:21.664
All right.

12:22.660 --> 12:23.607
- Remember it?
- Yep.

12:23.652 --> 12:25.553
Yep.

12:26.082 --> 12:27.382
(chuckles)

12:28.873 --> 12:30.306
Key?

12:38.596 --> 12:41.231
(mechanical whirring)

12:59.225 --> 13:01.504
- Ta-da.
- (chuckling)

13:01.506 --> 13:02.959
Oh, uh, king of hearts?

13:02.961 --> 13:04.997
Yes! How did you know?

13:05.063 --> 13:08.480
Magic. Stefan is supposed
to stab the chosen card.

13:08.536 --> 13:12.966
But lately he's being leaving
us to pick up the slack.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.854
Well, I gotta get back to the bar.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.753
"I love you to the moon and back."

13:24.858 --> 13:27.604
(David) It's definitely my chicken scratch.

13:30.095 --> 13:32.145
"To the moon and back."

13:32.157 --> 13:34.825
Wait, these holes don't look random.

13:44.003 --> 13:45.798
You see what I see?

13:45.866 --> 13:48.134
It's a constellation.

13:48.444 --> 13:51.471
David, you left me another clue.

13:51.473 --> 13:53.207
(scanner whirring)

13:53.696 --> 13:57.612
Okay, I am 99% sure this is Andromeda,

13:57.748 --> 13:59.471
which is a large northern constell...

13:59.529 --> 14:01.081
I know my constellations.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.268
Okay, of course, of course.

14:04.629 --> 14:07.135
Thank you, space camp.

14:07.738 --> 14:10.148
Huh, there's an extra star here.

14:10.459 --> 14:12.121
Why would you add an extra star?

14:12.191 --> 14:13.571
Okay, okay.

14:13.573 --> 14:16.938
So there are only a few
female constellations.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.643
What if the extra star is a marker?

14:19.645 --> 14:21.651
Maybe if I line this up with Jane's body,

14:21.653 --> 14:24.604
it'll pinpoint the tattoo you solved.

14:25.139 --> 14:26.405
The bull!

14:26.529 --> 14:28.780
Wait.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.144
We solved the bull already.

14:31.562 --> 14:33.405
Weeks ago.

14:33.881 --> 14:36.449
(sighs) What am I doing?

14:36.822 --> 14:38.732
Having a romantic adventure?

14:38.734 --> 14:40.608
David...

14:40.793 --> 14:42.355
you're dead.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.987
You solved this tattoo and...

14:45.089 --> 14:46.956
you thought if we...

14:47.039 --> 14:48.673
You know what?

14:48.873 --> 14:50.807
You were probably right.

14:53.236 --> 14:56.803
You probably would have charmed me
into getting back together with you.

14:59.237 --> 15:00.971
But you're dead.

15:02.727 --> 15:05.044
I don't get a second chance.

15:06.525 --> 15:08.426
But what if you do?

15:16.963 --> 15:18.464
Second chances.

15:18.466 --> 15:21.064
Some of the tattoos have multiple meanings.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.958
The bull was used in
conjunction with another tattoo.

15:25.960 --> 15:29.428
So... maybe it has its own meaning, too.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.951
This could lead to a second
totally different case.

15:32.046 --> 15:33.595
We're not done yet.

15:33.744 --> 15:35.253
Ha ha.

15:48.516 --> 15:51.554
Mmm. This is amazing.

15:51.616 --> 15:53.550
It's yakisoba...

15:53.798 --> 15:55.398
your favorite.

15:58.304 --> 16:00.027
Something wrong?

16:00.697 --> 16:02.844
It's just that, um...

16:05.121 --> 16:07.289
you know more about me than I do.

16:11.082 --> 16:14.618
What was I like before all of this?

16:15.427 --> 16:17.394
You were compassionate.

16:18.267 --> 16:21.623
Loyal, patient.

16:22.832 --> 16:25.424
So damn stubborn.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.120
I'm not that stubborn.

16:29.196 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, said every stubborn person ever.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.081
What else?

16:35.183 --> 16:36.550
Wait.

16:39.309 --> 16:42.578
<i>(music playing on phone)</i>

16:42.897 --> 16:44.598
What is this?

16:46.132 --> 16:46.794
Come here.

16:46.843 --> 16:50.697
(woman) <i>â™ª Imagine me â™ª</i>

16:50.699 --> 16:55.509
<i>â™ª Still loving you â™ª</i>

16:55.633 --> 16:59.398
<i>â™ª After all â™ª</i>

16:59.400 --> 17:03.189
<i>â™ª You've put me throughâ™ª</i>

17:24.968 --> 17:27.435
(phone ringing)

17:32.690 --> 17:33.550
Who the hell is this?

17:33.552 --> 17:35.721
(distorted voice) <i>You haven't
followed our instructions.</i>

17:35.784 --> 17:37.985
If you do anything to her, I'll
do everything in my power...

17:37.987 --> 17:39.652
<i>You don't get to make the threats.</i>

17:39.764 --> 17:43.169
<i>I told you to stop looking into
Tom Carter's disappearance.</i>

17:43.171 --> 17:44.489
I did everything you asked.

17:44.491 --> 17:47.331
<i>Your boss requisitioned the footage.</i>

17:47.333 --> 17:49.601
I had no idea she...

17:49.817 --> 17:51.218
How'd you even know that?

17:51.554 --> 17:55.122
<i>Destroy the file before she sees it.</i>

17:55.164 --> 17:56.965
Wait...

17:57.157 --> 17:59.126
Hello?

17:59.469 --> 18:00.558
Hello?

18:00.899 --> 18:04.282
I mean, it makes sense that it would
have something to do with Taurus.

18:04.399 --> 18:06.091
That's why you used the
whole constellation theme

18:06.093 --> 18:07.731
when you pre-programmed the automaton.

18:07.798 --> 18:09.232
That does sound like me.

18:09.300 --> 18:13.436
Yeah, but I mean, the Taurus is
so general, I could never just...

18:14.956 --> 18:16.623
Here, look.

18:17.470 --> 18:19.709
The bull is solid except for right there.

18:19.806 --> 18:21.700
Oh, yeah, his right eye is blank.

18:21.775 --> 18:23.766
Maybe if we just...

18:23.936 --> 18:26.483
That star lands perfectly in the circle.

18:26.748 --> 18:28.552
And the name of that star is...

18:28.626 --> 18:30.240
Aldebaran.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.984
Oh, we solved it!

18:32.001 --> 18:34.115
Oh, this is great!

18:34.268 --> 18:35.709
What is Aldebaran?

18:35.767 --> 18:39.796
This is the only place within 300
miles with Aldebaran in the name.

18:39.864 --> 18:43.006
I can't imagine why. I mean,
it just rolls off the tongue.

18:43.058 --> 18:45.659
The tattoo must point to something in here.

18:50.044 --> 18:52.312
(knocking on window)

18:55.689 --> 18:56.899
Can I help you?

18:56.971 --> 18:59.297
Hi. What time do you open?

18:59.383 --> 19:01.494
- Not for a couple hours.
- Okay.

19:01.525 --> 19:05.629
But you're welcome to
browse while I set up.

19:05.684 --> 19:08.558
That would be great. Thank you so much.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.168
(sighs) This could take days.

19:17.238 --> 19:18.238
I...

19:18.656 --> 19:21.131
Can you give me a hint or something?

19:21.572 --> 19:22.859
Look for something with a bull?

19:22.914 --> 19:26.343
Oh... (chuckles) Thank
you, Professor Helpful.

19:26.467 --> 19:28.399
- Okay.
- (man) Excuse me.

19:29.714 --> 19:31.355
I'm just sitting down for tea.

19:31.406 --> 19:33.967
- Do you want some?
- Oh, uh, yes.

19:33.969 --> 19:34.688
Thank you.

19:34.722 --> 19:38.074
I could, uh, really use some caffeine.

19:38.124 --> 19:40.239
- Mark Waterman.
- Hi.

19:47.921 --> 19:50.462
(distorted voice) <i>You don't
get to make the threats.</i>

19:52.348 --> 19:56.229
_

20:02.754 --> 20:06.511
So... yes, I know... it seems crazy,

20:06.574 --> 20:09.703
but I think this whole
treasure hunt he made for me

20:09.705 --> 20:11.105
ends here.

20:11.229 --> 20:16.060
Um, I think it's something
about Taurus or constellations

20:16.123 --> 20:18.811
or something I'm supposed to find.

20:18.859 --> 20:25.029
So someone coded messages all over
this city sending you to my shop?

20:25.099 --> 20:27.367
Yeah. (chuckling)

20:27.473 --> 20:29.843
Ah... see, it's crazy.

20:29.845 --> 20:31.179
(chuckles)

20:32.745 --> 20:34.215
I mean...

20:34.302 --> 20:37.333
I do have a rather large
astrological collection.

20:37.335 --> 20:38.746
Some very rare pieces.

20:38.748 --> 20:39.956
- You do?
- Yeah.

20:39.958 --> 20:41.360
Just here in the back.

20:41.385 --> 20:43.422
Let me get them for you.

20:47.785 --> 20:50.114
(glass shattering in distance)

20:54.913 --> 20:56.413
Mark?

20:58.767 --> 21:00.635
Mark?

21:01.084 --> 21:01.890
Aah!

21:22.031 --> 21:23.595
(groaning)

21:23.671 --> 21:25.805
(metal scraping)

21:38.382 --> 21:40.289
I know why they sent you.

21:42.107 --> 21:45.007
No, no. No one's sent me.

21:45.948 --> 21:47.397
I... I'm...

21:47.448 --> 21:48.997
I'm not here in any official way.

21:49.091 --> 21:51.412
I know they've been watching me.

21:51.573 --> 21:52.977
No.

21:54.024 --> 21:55.516
Please.

21:55.861 --> 21:58.596
The FBI is not watching you.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.355
I... I just...

22:00.396 --> 22:04.029
I stumbled in here because of
some stupid crossword puzzle.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.333
They've resumed their messages.

22:07.176 --> 22:09.349
No. No.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.430
(panting)

22:13.174 --> 22:14.758
Who's they?

22:15.575 --> 22:17.691
Maybe I can help you.

22:20.041 --> 22:21.078
Mark...

22:21.250 --> 22:24.576
Don't you call me that.

22:24.609 --> 22:27.053
They need a sacrifice under Taurus.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.615
They thirst.

22:28.683 --> 22:30.539
They...

22:30.617 --> 22:31.907
(groaning) Oh, oh.

22:31.962 --> 22:34.799
Patience. Wait for the moon.

22:36.593 --> 22:37.993
Where's Patterson?

22:38.061 --> 22:40.925
She missed her 7:15 with the new recruits.

22:40.981 --> 22:42.626
- That's not like her.
- I know.

22:42.766 --> 22:45.000
I tried her, but she's not picking up.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.370
Straight to voice mail.

22:47.464 --> 22:49.611
Tasha, turn it on remotely.

22:49.721 --> 22:52.440
Maybe she's just finally
taking time to mourn David.

22:52.533 --> 22:54.490
Patterson's been at the Bureau nine years.

22:54.568 --> 22:56.443
She's been absent never.

22:56.547 --> 22:57.611
The phone's dead.

22:57.679 --> 22:59.480
But you're right, she's
not taking time off.

22:59.590 --> 23:01.486
She accessed the building late last night.

23:01.572 --> 23:04.435
Signed in at 2:04 a.m.,
signed out three hours later.

23:04.516 --> 23:07.885
Why would she come into the
office in the middle of the night?

23:09.190 --> 23:11.925
She accessed the tattoo database.

23:12.078 --> 23:14.260
- She went after a tattoo.
- By herself?

23:14.330 --> 23:16.535
- She wouldn't do that.
- She's done it before.

23:16.613 --> 23:18.375
Reade, put out a BOLO.

23:18.377 --> 23:20.968
Tasha, I want to know everything
that she looked at in that database.

23:21.098 --> 23:24.109
We find the tattoo, we find Patterson.

23:24.459 --> 23:26.159
I've got her downstairs.

23:26.415 --> 23:29.027
Healthy blonde, lovely veins.

23:29.128 --> 23:30.329
Yes, FBI.

23:30.407 --> 23:31.974
Yes, I'm sure!

23:32.029 --> 23:35.576
No, listen to me, they left a
message in "The New York Times"!

23:35.638 --> 23:37.006
They need it.

23:37.050 --> 23:39.118
They need her.

23:40.955 --> 23:42.392
Why would you send me to this place?

23:42.394 --> 23:44.720
I didn't know it was gonna
lead to Buffalo Bill up there.

23:44.722 --> 23:47.465
I figured you'd hand it over to
your team once we solved the tattoo,

23:47.512 --> 23:48.695
like you always do.

23:48.763 --> 23:51.766
- I'm so stupid.
- Hey, opposite, opposite.

23:51.852 --> 23:53.067
Now focus.

23:53.134 --> 23:54.468
We gotta get you out of here.

23:54.536 --> 23:56.070
(sighs) Okay.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.698
You're right. (exhales sharply)

24:05.307 --> 24:07.742
(panting)

24:07.912 --> 24:09.313
Here, pass me that chair.

24:09.395 --> 24:11.596
How do you imagine I do that?

24:11.965 --> 24:13.266
Right.

24:15.770 --> 24:18.158
This the last tattoo Patterson accessed.

24:18.226 --> 24:19.752
Didn't we already solve the bull?

24:19.754 --> 24:21.445
We did, but Patterson
revisited it last night

24:21.500 --> 24:23.419
- for three hours.
- There's another case here.

24:23.489 --> 24:25.303
- (Mayfair) Where's it lead?
- (sighs) That we don't know.

24:25.355 --> 24:28.100
Patterson conducted all of her
research under her secure login.

24:28.232 --> 24:29.450
Well, can't we hack in?

24:29.571 --> 24:31.838
We could if Patterson were here.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.515
Her car just arrived at
an impound in midtown.

24:33.577 --> 24:36.252
- Where'd they tow it from?
- Tribeca, corner of Murray and Church.

24:36.341 --> 24:37.746
Let's move.

24:38.893 --> 24:41.427
(Patterson grunting)

24:45.582 --> 24:48.042
I know it hurts, but you can't stop.

24:48.178 --> 24:49.803
Hurry.

24:50.632 --> 24:52.833
(grunting)

25:08.376 --> 25:09.787
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

25:09.837 --> 25:12.070
It could be any one of these buildings.

25:15.651 --> 25:20.688
Aldebaran is the brightest star
in Taurus, as in the Taurus bull.

25:21.449 --> 25:22.389
What?

25:22.566 --> 25:25.576
I like stars, and I was very
unpopular in high school.

25:28.221 --> 25:29.788
(grunting)

25:41.601 --> 25:42.960
Patterson's coat.

25:43.024 --> 25:44.200
(Reade) What you thinking?

25:44.313 --> 25:45.745
(Weller) We're going in. Quietly.

25:45.786 --> 25:47.745
Tasha, unlock that.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.362
In.

26:04.138 --> 26:06.039
(footsteps above)

26:07.769 --> 26:09.937
(floor creaking)

26:39.457 --> 26:40.824
(Weller) Nothing down here.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.870
(grunts)

26:53.820 --> 26:55.812
Where am I?

27:01.491 --> 27:03.625
(bird cawing)

27:28.244 --> 27:32.604
According to the deed, Aldebaran
Antiques is owned by a Mark Waterman.

27:32.606 --> 27:33.483
What else do we know?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.804
Aside from buying this place
five years ago, the guy's a ghost.

27:35.860 --> 27:40.144
No birth certificate, no
driver's license, no tax returns.

27:40.245 --> 27:42.037
IAFIS got a hit off the
prints from the cash register.

27:42.101 --> 27:43.924
Former high school
history teacher Owen Lyman.

27:43.926 --> 27:44.944
When did he stop teaching?

27:45.007 --> 27:46.596
Six years ago. No record of him since.

27:46.610 --> 27:48.794
So Mark Waterman's a cover for Owen Lyman.

27:48.874 --> 27:50.477
Makes sense. Owen was a prime suspect

27:50.479 --> 27:52.456
in the murder investigation
of one of his former students.

27:52.546 --> 27:56.112
She was found in a remote field with
a constellation carved into her chest.

27:56.150 --> 27:59.728
He taught at a public
school, but he was represented

27:59.788 --> 28:02.378
by one of the best law firms in the state.

28:02.380 --> 28:03.364
Someone else footed the bill.

28:03.389 --> 28:07.364
Owen's brother is Rhode Island
State Senator Patrick Lyman.

28:07.466 --> 28:10.851
(Patrick) Do you know what
I've done to keep this quiet?

28:10.936 --> 28:14.740
The people that help us, Owen,

28:14.818 --> 28:16.996
they don't do it for free.

28:19.510 --> 28:22.848
This is the last time.

28:23.199 --> 28:24.833
Thank you.

28:26.179 --> 28:27.980
(grunting)

28:28.501 --> 28:30.422
Unh, come on.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.455
(Patrick) She's loose!

28:43.457 --> 28:45.139
I thought you tied her up!

28:45.279 --> 28:47.207
Patrick Lyman has a real
rags-to-riches story.

28:47.249 --> 28:50.806
He's a Southie kid, attends
Brown on an ROTC scholarship,

28:50.808 --> 28:54.048
serves in the Gulf, then goes
on to become this golden boy

28:54.134 --> 28:55.287
of the Democratic Party.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.752
They're priming him for a federal election.

28:58.719 --> 29:03.009
Patrick treated his brother to a one-year
stint at McLean Psychiatric Hospital.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.546
So he tried to get Owen help?

29:04.652 --> 29:06.695
By having him chemically castrated.

29:06.818 --> 29:09.598
Trying to stop him from
killing anyone else.

29:12.769 --> 29:13.936
(groans)

29:15.228 --> 29:17.129
(grunting)

29:23.397 --> 29:25.631
(Mark wailing)

29:28.860 --> 29:30.237
We're on our way to Owen's apartment.

29:30.297 --> 29:33.318
It looks like the Lyman brothers
have three other properties.

29:33.404 --> 29:34.325
Got locations?

29:34.326 --> 29:36.988
Patrick owns places in
Boston and Providence,

29:37.036 --> 29:39.209
and they own 30 acres on Long Island.

29:39.255 --> 29:40.723
They share a cabin out there.

29:40.799 --> 29:42.763
Owen's student was
found outside in a field.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.835
These guys never change their M.O.'s.

29:44.894 --> 29:46.200
Send us the cabin address.

29:46.234 --> 29:48.146
(Mayfair) <i>Just did.</i>

29:48.449 --> 29:50.650
(siren whooping)

30:01.280 --> 30:03.848
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't do that.

30:05.253 --> 30:07.388
I thought you left.

30:07.580 --> 30:09.615
I'm not letting you give up.

30:11.334 --> 30:12.968
Baby, get up. Stand up.

30:12.993 --> 30:14.741
Shh! Shh!

30:14.834 --> 30:16.701
(Patrick, distant) I found more prints!

30:18.212 --> 30:20.558
Those men are coming for me.

30:20.634 --> 30:22.993
- If they find me...
- That's why you need to stay here.

30:23.016 --> 30:24.678
Stay low and stay hidden.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.930
David, I'm so cold.

30:27.073 --> 30:28.628
I know.

30:39.842 --> 30:40.792
(Weller) Team...

30:40.887 --> 30:43.252
you see those footprints? Bare feet!

30:43.408 --> 30:44.865
She might have escaped.

30:44.959 --> 30:46.821
Looks like they went after her.

30:46.891 --> 30:50.755
All right, Tasha, Reade, clear the cabin.

30:50.837 --> 30:52.979
Jane and I will search the woods.

30:56.869 --> 30:57.869
(groans)

30:59.356 --> 31:01.100
Her prints stop here.

31:01.435 --> 31:03.498
She's used that stream to cover her tracks.

31:03.542 --> 31:04.709
We gotta split up.

31:04.847 --> 31:06.647
I'll take the left.

31:11.458 --> 31:13.421
(Weller, distant) Patterson!

31:14.974 --> 31:17.442
(bird cawing)

31:17.589 --> 31:19.289
Patterson!

31:21.077 --> 31:22.786
- Weller?
- That's real.

31:22.859 --> 31:25.094
He is real.

31:25.096 --> 31:27.559
Just like you're real, right?

31:27.715 --> 31:29.095
Get up.

31:29.225 --> 31:31.192
You have to get up.

31:31.276 --> 31:33.144
You need to find your team.

31:33.311 --> 31:34.812
Come on.

31:35.838 --> 31:37.063
Go!

31:37.163 --> 31:38.663
(softly) Okay.

31:40.260 --> 31:41.497
(Weller, distant) Patterson!

31:41.585 --> 31:43.420
Weller?

31:43.816 --> 31:45.314
I'm here!

31:45.416 --> 31:47.317
(softly) I'm here.

31:47.464 --> 31:48.931
(Patterson, distant) Weller?

31:53.609 --> 31:55.456
(Weller, distant) Patterson!

31:56.325 --> 31:57.401
That's the feds.

31:57.626 --> 31:58.924
<i>We gotta get out of here.</i>

31:58.970 --> 32:00.804
(quietly) She's so close!

32:05.245 --> 32:06.684
Freeze!

32:06.762 --> 32:07.947
Drop that weapon.

32:08.018 --> 32:09.793
- Put that weapon down.
- Easy.

32:09.856 --> 32:11.749
Take it easy. I'm just here to stop...

32:11.837 --> 32:13.288
- Get on your knees.
- Let's talk about this.

32:13.337 --> 32:14.948
Get on your knees!

32:15.055 --> 32:17.390
Come on, we can work this out.

32:17.498 --> 32:19.305
- I can get you anything you want.
- Shut up!

32:19.616 --> 32:21.504
You tell me where she is.

32:27.122 --> 32:27.975
(Jane, distant) Patterson!

32:28.038 --> 32:29.225
Jane?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.167
Jane?

32:38.849 --> 32:40.149
(gunshot)

32:43.355 --> 32:45.123
(gunshot, grunting)

32:56.995 --> 32:58.887
(Weller, distant) Where is she?!

33:11.873 --> 33:13.543
(loud grunt)

33:17.837 --> 33:19.637
(Patterson grunts, gunshot)

33:28.667 --> 33:29.901
Patterson?

33:30.048 --> 33:31.142
Here.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.816
We need to get you warm, okay?

33:32.823 --> 33:35.677
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay.

33:35.763 --> 33:36.709
You're safe, okay?

33:36.764 --> 33:39.032
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

33:42.586 --> 33:44.553
(sobs)

33:50.393 --> 33:54.569
Owen Lyman, who was living in New
York under the alias Mark Waterman,

33:54.624 --> 33:57.406
not only murdered his former student,

33:57.442 --> 33:59.450
but a dozen other women.

33:59.553 --> 34:04.317
Owen's Brooklyn residence had a stash
of mementos that catalogued his kills.

34:04.390 --> 34:07.789
So the people who tattooed Jane knew
he was looking to kill under Taurus?

34:07.791 --> 34:09.152
How could they have known that?

34:09.155 --> 34:10.666
They knew about Patrick's cover-up.

34:10.668 --> 34:11.527
(Mayfair) Correct.

34:11.529 --> 34:16.813
Senator Lyman took great strides to
keep his brother's crimes a secret.

34:16.889 --> 34:21.152
He cut a deal with DC Littlefield,
the powerful pharmaceutical lobby,

34:21.206 --> 34:23.241
after they found out about the murders.

34:23.327 --> 34:25.184
He was their puppet in Providence.

34:25.215 --> 34:26.199
They bought him off.

34:26.201 --> 34:29.464
They covered up his brother's
killings, he voted any way they wanted.

34:29.536 --> 34:31.467
And some pretty terrible legislation

34:31.469 --> 34:36.157
that benefited Big Pharma
got through again and again.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.482
Senator Lyman has been
charged with 13 counts

34:39.540 --> 34:42.382
of accessory to murder and
accessory after the fact

34:42.463 --> 34:45.205
for systematically covering
up his brother's crimes.

34:45.248 --> 34:49.623
He'll also face a slew of corruption
charges, as will DC Littlefield.

34:49.675 --> 34:51.898
So this wasn't just about the two brothers.

34:51.929 --> 34:53.864
It's much deeper than that.

34:53.931 --> 34:56.056
No wonder it was on Jane's body.

34:57.872 --> 34:59.613
Good work today.

35:10.347 --> 35:12.952
If you're having another moment of clarity,

35:12.954 --> 35:15.226
- tell someone else.
- I lied.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.262
Someone's been threatening me.

35:16.264 --> 35:18.155
They don't want me to look
into Carter's disappearance.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.780
- What? Who?
- I don't know.

35:19.782 --> 35:21.595
They wear a mask. They
use a voice modulator.

35:21.674 --> 35:25.041
They told me they'd kill Sarah if
I didn't delete the D.O.T. files.

35:25.088 --> 35:26.479
I don't understand it.

35:26.481 --> 35:29.083
The footage is a dead end.

35:29.110 --> 35:31.706
It's impossible to I.D. this guy.

35:33.880 --> 35:37.082
- Then why the threats?
- That's not your concern anymore.

35:37.286 --> 35:39.414
They've got to have a guy
on the inside at the D.O.T.

35:39.483 --> 35:42.418
No more theories. You're off this.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.584
I'm putting a detail on you and Sarah.

35:44.638 --> 35:45.551
You'll tip them off.

35:45.613 --> 35:47.378
They're very discreet.

35:47.380 --> 35:49.483
And I'm not asking.

35:49.485 --> 35:51.548
I've never questioned your judgment.

35:51.574 --> 35:53.783
Don't make me start.

35:54.230 --> 35:56.055
Thank you.

36:04.045 --> 36:05.771
What's up with you and Mayfair?

36:05.850 --> 36:06.992
What, are you spying on me now?

36:07.069 --> 36:09.071
Hey! I'm just asking.

36:09.110 --> 36:10.099
And I'm telling you not to.

36:10.139 --> 36:12.529
So, clearly it's something.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.583
Look, I'm here if you need to talk.

36:14.623 --> 36:16.224
Let it go.

36:23.660 --> 36:25.294
Hello there.

36:25.518 --> 36:26.811
Oh, if I'd known you were coming,

36:26.813 --> 36:29.314
I would have bought more cupcakes. Ah.

36:29.371 --> 36:31.607
I guess we can split half a vanilla...

36:31.738 --> 36:33.531
Thought about what you said...

36:34.579 --> 36:36.346
about Mayfair.

36:36.813 --> 36:40.150
If Mayfair's going down,
she goes down alone.

36:40.363 --> 36:43.341
I don't want my friends
being dragged down with her.

36:44.250 --> 36:45.904
You got it, partner.

36:47.232 --> 36:48.865
I'm not your partner.

36:49.342 --> 36:50.545
Sarah...

36:50.701 --> 36:52.705
you don't have to move out.

36:52.791 --> 36:55.527
Tonight's about Sawyer, okay? That's it.

36:55.595 --> 36:57.787
Guys, come on, dig in. It's gonna get cold.

36:57.850 --> 37:00.861
- It looks delicious.
- Thanks.

37:06.163 --> 37:09.803
I'd like to say, to Sawyer...

37:09.915 --> 37:11.420
our little gallbladder,

37:11.576 --> 37:14.526
if anybody in this family's
gonna win "The Voice,"

37:14.672 --> 37:16.256
it's you.

37:17.634 --> 37:20.024
And I'd also like to say...

37:20.219 --> 37:21.920
to Dad.

37:22.538 --> 37:26.352
I know there's been
some distance between us.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.283
I'm glad that distance is going away.

37:32.325 --> 37:35.700
I'm really happy we're all a family again.

37:44.465 --> 37:46.052
Come here, son.

37:49.602 --> 37:51.536
I love you, Kurt.

37:57.742 --> 38:02.517
I had this memory of us
at my memorial service.

38:03.163 --> 38:05.564
I can't make sense of it.

38:05.797 --> 38:08.536
Why were we surveilling Weller?

38:08.608 --> 38:11.793
You wanted to make sure he
was still... connected to you.

38:11.864 --> 38:15.167
So we were assessing his vulnerability?

38:15.349 --> 38:17.956
Your coming back has helped him.

38:18.098 --> 38:20.658
We need you to tell Weller
you're having memories.

38:20.683 --> 38:23.918
Remembering him. Remembering Clearfield.

38:24.050 --> 38:26.185
But I'm... I'm not.

38:26.439 --> 38:27.826
That's what these are for.

38:27.897 --> 38:30.031
They're from when you were little.

38:36.596 --> 38:38.212
These aren't memories. They're pictures.

38:38.214 --> 38:41.737
Pictures that will help you compose
memories that will be familiar to him.

38:41.739 --> 38:43.609
He's mourned you his whole life.

38:43.702 --> 38:47.102
A memory will provide him
comfort, keep you close.

38:49.192 --> 38:53.045
Are we just gonna pretend like
nothing happened last night?

38:53.393 --> 38:57.982
Well, I think that was, uh,
that was probably a mistake.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.718
Right?

39:00.044 --> 39:01.320
Right.

39:01.436 --> 39:02.848
Right.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.893
(bag zipping)

39:17.760 --> 39:18.927
Thank you...

39:19.048 --> 39:20.649
for saying that to Dad.

39:22.629 --> 39:23.723
I meant it.

39:23.725 --> 39:26.440
Look, I shouldn't have blamed
you for what happened with Edgar.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.302
I just, um...

39:29.684 --> 39:31.550
I don't know what happened.

39:31.670 --> 39:32.618
- Sarah...
- (thudding)

39:32.685 --> 39:35.147
(Sawyer) Mom! Mom!

39:36.019 --> 39:37.249
Oh, my God.

39:37.864 --> 39:39.493
Dad. Dad!

39:39.778 --> 39:41.116
Call an ambulance.

39:41.284 --> 39:42.384
Dad!

39:49.231 --> 39:51.184
- Thank you.
- For what?

39:53.091 --> 39:54.626
Everything.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.824
Today and... scavenger hunt.

39:58.933 --> 40:01.867
Have you forgotten that
I almost got you killed?

40:10.031 --> 40:11.198
(sniffles)

40:11.395 --> 40:13.464
I'm so sorry.

40:17.154 --> 40:20.473
I... I don't know how I'm
ever gonna forgive myself...

40:20.515 --> 40:23.116
You can't blame yourself.

40:23.647 --> 40:25.523
But I do. I... if I hadn't have...

40:25.601 --> 40:28.074
It's not your fault.

40:31.093 --> 40:33.027
You loved me.

40:33.267 --> 40:35.314
I know that.

40:35.420 --> 40:37.107
And I loved you.

40:37.785 --> 40:39.216
You know that.

40:39.319 --> 40:41.818
That won't go away.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.915
I know you think you're never
gonna find someone like me again,

40:45.053 --> 40:48.755
and... well, you're right.

40:48.919 --> 40:54.007
It'll be impossible to find someone with
my specific intellectual and sexual gifts.

40:54.086 --> 40:56.394
- (chuckles)
- I know it seems impossible,

40:56.449 --> 41:00.439
but one day you're gonna
be ready for someone else.

41:00.607 --> 41:02.984
And he's gonna be incredible.

41:03.676 --> 41:06.278
Know who I've always liked?

41:06.533 --> 41:08.688
That Borden guy.

41:12.260 --> 41:14.179
You've never even met him.

41:14.288 --> 41:15.760
Oh, you're right.

41:15.856 --> 41:20.026
It's almost like I'm the
manifestation of your subconscious.

41:24.890 --> 41:26.608
I'm gonna go.

41:30.469 --> 41:32.761
I don't want you to.

41:32.845 --> 41:34.359
I know...

41:35.881 --> 41:38.115
but I'm already gone.

41:54.886 --> 41:56.720
Good-bye, David.
