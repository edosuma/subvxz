00:36.280 --> 00:38.647
Fuck this.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.369
- Let me inside!
- There's no way they're getting in.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.326
Yes, there is.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.410
- How much longer?
- 30 seconds.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.567
- That's it!
- Let's go!

01:21.640 --> 01:25.042
Son of a bitch.

01:30.040 --> 01:34.011
Nobody's supposed to die.
You said nobody's supposed to die!

01:34.080 --> 01:36.731
I lied.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.531
TRANSIT

02:50.360 --> 02:55.082
<i>...Tuesday, so drink lots of water.
Temperatures are skyrocketing...</i>

02:55.160 --> 02:59.882
<i>...and we're expecting...
...all major arteries coming to...</i>

03:11.440 --> 03:15.206
<i>...route 962 is...</i>

03:15.280 --> 03:20.491
<i>...take every precaution...</i>

03:20.560 --> 03:24.610
<i>...four suspects fleeing the scene
no vehicle description...</i>

03:24.680 --> 03:29.481
<i>...proceed with caution,
suspects are armed and...</i>

03:29.560 --> 03:34.726
<i>Four armed suspects.
Repeat. Four armed suspects.</i>

03:43.280 --> 03:45.567
- Slow down.
- Yeah, right.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.725
- Why are we heading west?
- They're talking about the 10.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.043
Shit. I told you!
There's a roadblock ahead.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.682
- What are we going to do now?
- Everyone calm down.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.005
I told you to ditch that.
It's a murder weapon.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.091
- Shit!
- Just cross the median.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.322
Hey, Evers. Right. Turn right there.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.124
LUCKY LOUIE'S
TRUCK STOP

04:41.840 --> 04:44.491
So, now what?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.527
- Dad, turn the shit off, please?
- Hey!

05:08.840 --> 05:11.650
How long has he been
cursing like that?

05:11.720 --> 05:15.770
I don't know. It stopped
being shocking six months ago.

05:19.520 --> 05:25.562
Shane? When we get off the
interstate, you can play your music.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.928
- Big mistake.
- You want to play your music?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.561
You don't want his music.
It's all bitches and hoes.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.883
Well, it is. Mom, yell at him!

05:35.960 --> 05:40.522
There's a rest stop. Maybe we should
get something to drink?

05:42.360 --> 05:45.887
- What are we going to do?
- Ditch the car. Go on foot.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.850
120 miles to the boat?
We've got to cross tonight!

05:48.920 --> 05:53.847
- Or chance it with the roadblock.
- No. We fit the description.

05:53.920 --> 05:58.642
Okay, so... we split up.
We meet up on the other side.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.486
One of us takes the bag,
hitches a ride to the port.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.562
Fine, I'll do it.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.123
- And go to Mexico without us?
- Exactly. We don't split up!

06:20.640 --> 06:24.167
Evers. Go up and park.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.402
Do it.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.402
I can't even feel my left butt cheek.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.050
Dad? Are we going
to be back by Thursday?

06:38.120 --> 06:40.851
- Saturday.
- Shocker.

06:40.920 --> 06:47.371
- Dave's having a pool party.
- We'll see. I said we'll see.

06:51.320 --> 06:56.087
- Think fast!
- Kenny. What are you doing?

06:56.160 --> 06:58.925
- You getting too old?
- Like hell I am.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.644
- This won't work.
- It will, play it cool.

07:03.720 --> 07:08.123
- I'm not feeling it.
- What do you think, baby?

07:15.640 --> 07:18.041
Easy.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.527
- Do it.
- This is bullshit!

07:33.600 --> 07:37.127
You're starting to become a problem.
Leave the gun.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.285
- I'm not going to shoot them.
- Leave the gun.

07:43.320 --> 07:46.529
Go. Come on!

07:46.600 --> 07:49.285
Dad? What's a "half-and-halfâ€œ?

07:49.360 --> 07:54.207
- Kenny, stop reading the walls.
- Is it something sexual?

07:54.280 --> 07:58.683
It's something you put in your
coffee. Stop reading the walls.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.440
Sweetheart, you almost ready?

09:43.720 --> 09:46.883
Okay. Think fast, Kenny.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.005
Fuck! Whose retarded
fucking idea was this?

10:30.080 --> 10:33.368
- Lay off it.
- That bag is one-quarter mine.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.046
It's one-quarter mine, too.

10:43.120 --> 10:48.365
- Oh, my God. It's a parking lot.
- What's your hurry?

10:52.120 --> 10:54.248
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.721
- Butch, Jimmy and Joe.
- Who?

10:56.800 --> 11:00.441
Butch your arms around me,
Jimmy a kiss before you Joe.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.922
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

11:08.360 --> 11:11.045
- I got one. Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

11:11.120 --> 11:14.488
- Who gives a shit?
- Shane, watch your mouth.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.245
Afternoon.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.408
What's the problem, Officer?

11:38.480 --> 11:42.690
Sir, I'm going to ask you
to pull over to the right, there.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.762
Sure.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.802
- How're you doing?
- Fine. What can I do for you?

12:00.880 --> 12:04.885
Step out of the vehicle
for me, please.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.567
- Mind if I search it?
- Sure, be my guest.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.371
Step out of the car, please.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.446
- You going camping?
- Yes, Sir.

13:00.520 --> 13:05.003
- Who belongs to this?
- That's mine, it's a scanner.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.642
I know what it is.
Why do you have it?

13:09.720 --> 13:13.520
Is it against the law?

13:20.240 --> 13:23.881
Would you mind telling us
what it is we've done wrong?

13:23.960 --> 13:29.126
Thought you folks might have robbed
an armored truck near Baton Rouge.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.170
I think I might remember that.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.604
Clean.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.720
You folks have a good day.

14:00.600 --> 14:05.845
- Give us some props. It worked.
- I'll celebrate when I get the money.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.811
- Run them off the road.
- That's not the plan.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.724
There's no rush.
They're going our way.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.043
- For how long?
- Losada, think about it.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.409
They have Texas plates,
probably from Dallas or Houston.

14:20.480 --> 14:25.566
A city family with a load of gear.
They're headed for the coast.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.049
- I don't get it.
- Of course you don't.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.363
Does she shut up when your dick
is in her mouth?

14:41.400 --> 14:45.610
They're going camping
in the middle of nowhere. Alone.

14:48.320 --> 14:54.009
Why'd you tell Shane we'd come back
earlier? We need this time together.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.289
He's a teenager,
what do you expect?

14:58.640 --> 15:02.725
What's your excuse?
Nobody wants to do this.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.646
Nobody wants to reconnect,
we're just wasting time.

15:06.720 --> 15:10.964
We decided we're doing this.
We're all here.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.203
What more do you want?

15:14.280 --> 15:16.760
I just...

15:17.960 --> 15:21.362
I just want everything to be
like it was before.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.369
- Still part of your plan?
- Fuck you.

15:39.440 --> 15:44.241
- Just keep looking.
- Anybody see them?

15:46.080 --> 15:49.846
- There they are!
- How are we going to get up there?

15:49.920 --> 15:53.641
- Turn around!
- Everybody hang on.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.564
- We got them.
- Good.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.249
Hey. Jeff Gordon, watch your speed.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.921
Dad? What's going on?

18:06.080 --> 18:08.447
What are you doing? Slow down.

18:08.520 --> 18:12.002
- Are you racing this guy?
- Everybody hold on.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.642
- Make him pass.
- I don't think he wants to pass.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.482
Don't let them get away.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.730
One, two...

18:31.800 --> 18:33.848
- Cop!
- I don't see him.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.161
- Slow down.
- Get it over with.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.163
Fuck!

18:46.480 --> 18:48.289
Damn it, Nate.

18:48.360 --> 18:52.604
- You're getting pulled over.
- Thanks for pointing that out.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.529
- Get back in your vehicle.
- They were chasing us.

19:16.600 --> 19:20.400
- You've got to go after them.
- No, they were piggybacking.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.280
Speeding in your radar shadow,
letting you take the fall.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.321
Worked, didn't it?
License and registration, please.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.685
- If they find the money...
- They won't.

19:37.760 --> 19:42.163
They don't know to look for it,
they're getting a speeding ticket.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.607
It's just a setback.

19:48.360 --> 19:51.091
Pull over at the next town,
wait for them.

19:51.160 --> 19:56.963
Now we've got to wait
for our own money. That's right.

19:58.600 --> 20:03.845
Please understand. I wouldn't make
up a story to avoid a lousy ticket.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.925
Lousy ticket?
This is Louisiana, not Texas.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.325
88 in a 50 here gets you reckless
driving, a class 2 misdemeanor.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.689
Oh, no, no.
Officer, you can't do this.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.731
- I can't? We've got laws here, Sir.
- I understand that.

20:25.240 --> 20:30.804
A misdemeanor's going to get me
in a hell of a lot of trouble.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.850
It'll put me
in violation of my parole.

20:36.200 --> 20:41.127
- You're an ex-con?
- I just served 18 months in Elgin.

20:41.200 --> 20:46.127
I'm not a violent offender,
it was just real estate fraud.

20:46.200 --> 20:50.046
"Just", if you didn't
want back to Club Fed

20:50.120 --> 20:53.602
you shouldn't have tried to break
the sound barrier on my road.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.968
Get back in your vehicle.
We have a fair magistrate.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.283
He'll be fascinated by
your story of being chased.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.523
- Get back in your vehicle.
- Officer, please.

21:03.600 --> 21:08.811
Whoa! Get on the ground!
Down on the ground, now!

21:08.880 --> 21:12.009
On the ground, now.
All the way! All the way!

21:12.080 --> 21:15.527
Put your hands behind your back.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.844
I told you clearly to get back in
your vehicle. Did you listen? No.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.686
- No, you did not.
- Shit.

21:37.720 --> 21:42.601
- What are they doing?
- Looks like Daddy has a temper.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.444
I'm going to have two kids
in college before long.

21:50.520 --> 21:57.404
It was easy money. Secure loans
for some over-valued properties.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.609
- Which is a gray area.
- But you got caught.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.325
Buyer was a drug dealer and this
was part of a laundering scheme.

22:08.880 --> 22:14.762
I had no idea.
That's why the IRS got involved.

22:18.360 --> 22:23.446
It was a big mistake. Cost me 18
months, my broker's license...

22:23.520 --> 22:26.410
...and the trust of my family.

22:30.840 --> 22:35.641
- Is that your wife?
- 40 years and counting.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.564
How do you do it?

22:39.560 --> 22:44.566
I don't know. I guess, if you say
you're going to fix the screen door...

22:44.640 --> 22:47.610
-you'd better fix the screen door.

22:47.680 --> 22:52.720
The first time you let her down,
she'll be waiting for the next time.

22:57.320 --> 23:02.645
Dad got pulled over plenty of times,
and he never ended up like that.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.451
When you break the law,
they don't trust you.

23:05.520 --> 23:09.286
- It's not fair.
- Get used to it, Dad's a convict.

23:09.360 --> 23:14.969
Shane, he's not a convict. He served
his time, he made a mistake.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.486
He's in jail right now, isn't he?

23:17.560 --> 23:21.167
They won't send him
back to Florida, right?

23:21.240 --> 23:24.369
Guys, it was a misunderstanding.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.603
- I like having Dad home again.
- I know you do.

23:37.760 --> 23:43.051
Mom? Why don't you go inside?
We've got this.

23:45.560 --> 23:49.690
Don't stay up too late.
We're going to be on the road early.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.846
- It's heavy.
- Want me to help you?

24:03.280 --> 24:05.681
I got it.

24:08.960 --> 24:14.603
Yeah. I understand. Okay. Alright.

24:14.680 --> 24:18.048
Judge is in Baton Rouge. He won't
be back until late tonight.

24:18.120 --> 24:21.806
Why don't we let Mr. Sidwell
spend the night at the motel?

24:21.880 --> 24:28.206
This man failed to cooperate with a
police officer. He is an ex-convict.

24:28.280 --> 24:32.365
Okay, fine. You've made your point,
Lieutenant. Okay?

24:32.440 --> 24:35.842
Tell your family you're
going to be here overnight.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.446
What?

24:41.200 --> 24:43.567
I'm sorry.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.289
- Can we go back now?
- No. Not yet.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.522
What is that?

24:58.600 --> 25:01.490
- Holy shit!
- Shut up.

25:15.960 --> 25:22.411
<i>...investigation into the robbery in
Baton Rouge...</i>

25:22.480 --> 25:29.045
<i>...suspects were armed
and shots were fired...</i>

25:29.120 --> 25:33.523
You know they're
getting divorced, right?

25:33.600 --> 25:40.529
Dad said they weren't. Why would
they get divorced? He's back home.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.446
Yeah, right.
Except now he's a lying fuck.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.369
Nate?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.926
- Damn it!
- Shit.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.401
<i>The largest robbery...</i>

27:04.480 --> 27:07.962
- Headquarters to Greenwell Springs.
- Greenwell Springs.

27:08.040 --> 27:12.364
We received a call from the Springs
motel, possible 10-14 in progress.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.808
- Copy.
- What's that mean? What's 10-14?

27:15.880 --> 27:20.681
- Possible 10-14 at the Springs Motel.
- That's where my family is, right?

27:21.840 --> 27:25.128
Get to the motel,
I'll see if I can raise Mike.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.247
Where is it?

27:35.280 --> 27:39.842
Call from the Springs Motel,
possible 10-14 in progress.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.491
- We've got to go.
- Come on!

27:59.880 --> 28:01.928
Help!

28:04.160 --> 28:09.041
What happened? What happened?
Listen to me. Calm down.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.526
- Paolo.
- Go for Paolo.

28:14.600 --> 28:21.722
There's been an incident. Get down
here, and bring Mr. Sidwell with you.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.564
On our way.

28:28.920 --> 28:33.608
<i>No me importa. Digale que Losada
lo llama. Esperare.</i>

28:33.680 --> 28:37.651
You gave it away. Four million
dollars, you gave it away.

28:37.720 --> 28:41.884
What, you want to take a shot,
Losada? Let's see you try.

28:41.960 --> 28:45.567
Don't fucking tempt me, you bitch.

28:45.640 --> 28:49.645
Your boyfriend's the only thing
keeping you alive right now.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.885
<i>Oye, Oscar, soy yo...</i>

28:57.680 --> 29:00.684
Are you just going
to stand there and watch?

29:00.760 --> 29:05.084
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm being serious.

29:06.720 --> 29:10.247
It's all just a hiccup.

29:11.360 --> 29:16.287
In 48 hours, we'll be on a beach,
drinking <i>cervesas.</i>

29:16.360 --> 29:19.967
And making babies.

29:20.040 --> 29:24.921
Yeah. That sounds nice.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.403
Hey, Dad.
What did they want with us?

29:37.480 --> 29:41.041
We're nice-looking
out-of-town people.

29:41.120 --> 29:45.444
They think we've got nice things
they could sell for drug money.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.731
- Hey, what's the story?
- They had another room.

29:51.800 --> 29:56.124
Money must have been in there.
Cops advised them to go home.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.851
- What about the boat?
- I've got that covered.

29:58.920 --> 30:03.323
We can make it tomorrow. Right now,
we need the fucking money.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.529
We just need to know
which way it's headed.

30:09.120 --> 30:14.445
It's headed south.
They're going to keep going.

30:14.520 --> 30:19.287
I want to go home. What part of that
do you not understand?

30:19.360 --> 30:24.764
Sweetheart, please. Whoever it was
took off. Cops are outside.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.242
They're reducing the ticket
so it's not a misdemeanor

30:28.320 --> 30:31.449
and giving us a police escort
in the morning.

30:31.520 --> 30:35.889
We've driven 200 miles, we can be
at the campground tomorrow.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.531
Dad, I want to go home.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.046
Well, that's two votes for home.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.529
What about you, Kenny?

30:51.320 --> 30:55.450
Hey, guys. Today was a lousy day.

30:55.520 --> 31:01.129
No argument. This was the shittiest
day... oh, excuse my language.

31:04.280 --> 31:08.330
This family is in trouble.
That's my fault, I know.

31:11.760 --> 31:17.164
It was hard to be in your lives
from 2,000 miles away.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.164
That's why we're doing this.

31:21.840 --> 31:27.165
Hey. You guys know I used to come
down here to camp with my dad?

31:28.200 --> 31:31.363
You know that?

31:31.440 --> 31:35.684
Some of my greatest childhood
memories. You know that?

31:35.760 --> 31:39.924
Kenny, Shane...

31:41.800 --> 31:46.010
...we need to have
memories like that.

31:46.080 --> 31:50.847
We need to get to know
each other again.

31:50.920 --> 31:58.566
Robyn, if we turn back now,
what's going to become of us?

31:58.640 --> 32:02.008
Shane?

32:04.120 --> 32:06.646
Kenny?

32:06.720 --> 32:12.523
- I want to go camping.
- That's good! - Come on, baby.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.366
Let's see what they've got.

32:46.840 --> 32:52.290
So, I'll see you guys
out to the town limits.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.842
I'm sorry about everything.
All of it.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.606
- Y'all have a safe trip.
- Yup.

33:07.520 --> 33:11.081
Come on. That's the best you can do?

33:13.400 --> 33:18.088
We can't take the cop. We've got to
get them in the next town.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.525
We wait until the Bayou.
Take this path and intercept them.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.524
- That's right.
- Are you sure about that?

33:38.080 --> 33:40.481
Trust me.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.762
You folks drive safe, now.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.121
POSTED
PRIVATE PROPERTY

34:39.320 --> 34:45.521
Dad? Dad? The bungee's loose,
can we fix it, please?

35:17.080 --> 35:20.846
- Holy shit!
- Shane, watch your mouth!

35:20.920 --> 35:25.562
- But it's a gator. Look at it!
- That's just a baby.

35:25.640 --> 35:31.568
They're out there and will eat you.
Don't wander into muddy water, cher.

35:31.640 --> 35:37.044
Tie this one up, the top's undone.
<i>- Cher,</i> that be short forma <i>cheri.</i>

35:37.120 --> 35:41.808
â€œKitty, what are you doing?
You've never been to the Thibodaux."

35:41.880 --> 35:45.930
- â€œI know the Cajun way, you know!"
- Boys, get in the car.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.970
Get in the car now!

35:52.520 --> 35:55.569
- You lousy son of a bitch!
- What?

35:55.640 --> 35:58.962
That's why we had to go camping
near the border.

35:59.040 --> 36:05.207
- What are you talking about?
- Who are they, Nate? Who are they?

36:05.280 --> 36:07.965
I almost got killed last night!

36:08.040 --> 36:12.045
I can't believe you would do that
to your own family!

36:12.120 --> 36:16.011
Your own kids.
What is wrong with you?

36:16.080 --> 36:20.130
I'm leaving you here with the
only thing you give a shit about.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.363
Robyn!

36:23.440 --> 36:26.808
Roll the window down now.
Get over here!

36:26.880 --> 36:30.009
Robyn!

36:37.920 --> 36:40.321
Mom?

37:14.480 --> 37:16.482
Shit!

37:37.960 --> 37:41.328
- Mom, what happened?
- What's going on?

37:41.400 --> 37:45.121
I don't know.
Your dad's in trouble again.

37:45.200 --> 37:49.603
He took something that didn't belong
to him and someone wants it back.

37:49.680 --> 37:53.651
Was that who broke into your room?

37:53.720 --> 37:57.202
- Is Dad going back to prison?
- Who cares!

37:57.280 --> 37:59.760
Who cares?

38:14.280 --> 38:20.083
You are so stupid! Stupid!

38:14.280 --> 38:17.011
Pull over, Mom. Come on.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.651
Pull over, Mom. Come on.

40:12.720 --> 40:17.328
Mom, pull over, get Dad. We'll
go home, everything will be fine.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.607
- Mom!
- Run, boys, run!

40:45.680 --> 40:48.286
Go! Get out of the car!

40:52.960 --> 40:55.201
Get them!

40:55.280 --> 40:57.442
Get the bag!

41:25.120 --> 41:27.441
- It's not here!
- Where's the bag?

41:27.520 --> 41:29.841
We don't have it!

41:29.920 --> 41:35.404
Wait a minute. Where's Daddy?
Huh? Where's Daddy?

41:45.440 --> 41:48.808
Why did you leave him
in the middle of nowhere?

41:48.880 --> 41:52.043
No! No!

41:52.120 --> 41:55.044
- Shane!
- Give me your phone!

42:12.640 --> 42:18.443
- Shane, no!
- Don't do that again.

42:24.680 --> 42:29.527
No! Shane! Get up. My god, Shane!

42:29.600 --> 42:34.640
- Are you alright, baby?
- Don't hurt us, please.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.883
We don't have the money.
I'm telling you the truth.

42:37.960 --> 42:42.204
I left my husband on the road
back there. He has your money.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.647
Then let's go get it.

42:49.640 --> 42:53.201
Hey! Hey!

42:53.280 --> 42:58.002
- No!
- You catch up. Come on.

42:59.760 --> 43:04.766
Hey! Hey, hey!

43:06.080 --> 43:08.208
Hey!

43:23.640 --> 43:28.043
- You see what's happening?
- Marek's taking care of it.

43:31.840 --> 43:36.971
Him and that bitch. I'm sure
they can divide four million by two.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.240
Are you going to hurt him?

44:06.240 --> 44:09.926
I don't know what scheme he's into.
Please don't hurt him.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.005
What are you talking about?
Where is he?

44:47.960 --> 44:51.009
Did my Dad steal
the money from you?

44:51.080 --> 44:55.529
Your soccer coach dad steal money
from us? That's adorable.

45:30.080 --> 45:33.323
- Money. Where's the money?
- Take it easy.

45:40.080 --> 45:44.961
- I want the money.
- I want my family.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.611
- Where is it?
- Go look around!

45:50.800 --> 45:55.283
- Where is it?
- You let my family go.

46:04.040 --> 46:06.361
What the fuck?

46:14.240 --> 46:17.289
Get up.

46:21.640 --> 46:24.689
Let them go.

46:24.760 --> 46:29.004
Hey. Hey! Come on.
Let's get in the car.

46:29.080 --> 46:33.642
Get in the car.
- You get up. Get up! Come on.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.891
Get in.

46:50.360 --> 46:53.489
- Yeah?
- How the hell did you miss him?

46:53.560 --> 46:58.771
We got the Dad. He stashed the
money, wants to trade for the family.

46:58.840 --> 47:05.007
Be right there.
- Turn around. Turn around!

47:05.080 --> 47:09.768
Turn around! Let's go! Fuck!

47:12.600 --> 47:14.728
You put a lot of trust in those two.

47:14.800 --> 47:18.202
And you saw how easy it was
for them to leave us.

47:18.280 --> 47:22.001
- He wouldn't. He needs you.
- That's right.

47:22.080 --> 47:25.289
That's why I should
be calling the shots.

47:25.360 --> 47:29.524
I'm the linchpin. His part is over.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.888
Did you stash your guns
in somebody else's car?

47:32.960 --> 47:36.726
Or did you rob
an armored truck with that one?

47:38.320 --> 47:42.689
I'm going to cut your fucking yuppie
head off, if you don't shut up.

48:00.880 --> 48:05.841
- I'm sorry.
- Please... let them go.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.890
Where's the money?

48:08.960 --> 48:12.407
Listen... we can
work this out. No!

48:12.480 --> 48:15.689
Do you think you're
in a position to deal?

48:15.760 --> 48:19.367
- I'll take you to it.
- Yes, you will.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.287
Go get it.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.691
Where is he?

49:36.960 --> 49:41.363
You stay calm. Think about your kids.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.641
Come on.

50:08.320 --> 50:11.847
Where's the bag?

50:11.920 --> 50:15.049
- Where's the bag?
- I thought we had a deal.

50:15.120 --> 50:18.203
- What deal?
- The money for my family.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.681
Yeah, so where's the money?

50:22.240 --> 50:25.449
Let my family go
and I'll give you the money.

50:25.520 --> 50:29.809
- Hey, asshole. Deal with me, not him.
- Who's in charge here?

50:29.880 --> 50:32.360
- I am!
- Fuck you, man!

50:32.440 --> 50:35.125
Shut your mouth,
I'm dealing with this!

50:35.200 --> 50:39.489
Want to get on a boat to Mexico?
Push me again.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.847
- Where's the bag? Where is it?
- Please get him off me.

50:55.640 --> 50:59.725
- Let go. Let him go.
- What's wrong with you?

50:59.800 --> 51:04.249
- I said lay off.
- You fucking asshole!

51:06.040 --> 51:09.089
Don't even try it, shithead!

51:11.160 --> 51:13.686
Go, Mom. Go!

51:15.800 --> 51:18.246
Mom!

51:26.880 --> 51:29.281
Holy shit!

51:32.680 --> 51:35.729
Dad!

51:39.000 --> 51:41.844
Slow down, slow down.
Mom, slow down.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.641
- Close it!
- Call 911!

51:48.720 --> 51:51.485
- They took the phones.
- What happened to your hand?

51:51.560 --> 51:54.962
- Are you crazy?
- They don't have guns!

51:55.040 --> 51:57.520
- We're fine.
- You guys okay?

51:57.600 --> 51:59.967
- Nate, look.
- What?

52:00.040 --> 52:04.011
- Okay, okay.
- Dad, what do we do?

52:04.080 --> 52:08.642
Okay. It's 40 miles to the next town.

52:08.720 --> 52:13.487
We've got to turn this around. We've
got to get back to Greenwell Springs.

52:13.560 --> 52:18.600
You can do this, okay?
Sweetheart. Okay?

52:27.960 --> 52:32.761
- Come here. Come here.
- I'm sorry.

52:35.120 --> 52:38.522
Hey, they're coming back!

52:43.280 --> 52:45.760
Come on!

52:55.720 --> 53:00.203
- You didn't do anything, did you?
- No. These guys pulled a heist.

53:00.280 --> 53:03.090
Remember that roadblock?
They used us to get through.

53:11.680 --> 53:15.321
- Just give them the money.
- These guys are killers.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.802
We have to try,
they're not going to give up.

53:18.880 --> 53:21.201
Dad? Where's the money?

53:23.120 --> 53:26.169
- Dad, where's the money?
- I lost it!

53:33.240 --> 53:36.847
Kill the wife, kill the teenager.

53:36.920 --> 53:41.801
Slit their throats.
Watch them bleed out.

53:41.880 --> 53:46.807
Then put the knife to the kid. He'll
tell us where the money is then.

53:46.880 --> 53:51.044
- What happened to the money?
- There was a guy in a boat.

53:51.120 --> 53:54.602
He must have found it. That's
the only thing that makes sense.

53:54.680 --> 53:59.607
About the only thing that makes
sense. Why did you hide the money?

53:59.680 --> 54:02.763
I hid the money to have leverage
to get you back.

54:02.840 --> 54:06.925
- I don't think like a criminal.
- Nate! Stop it!

54:10.000 --> 54:14.449
Dad, a cop car!

54:16.200 --> 54:19.568
Police! Police!

54:23.360 --> 54:25.408
Hey, hey!

54:31.600 --> 54:35.810
- Lieutenant!
- What happened?

54:35.880 --> 54:38.247
Those guys are still after us.

54:38.320 --> 54:41.210
- What guys?
- What guys?

54:41.280 --> 54:43.760
The guys you arrested me for.

54:43.840 --> 54:47.686
The guys you took me to jail for,
who attacked my wife!

54:47.760 --> 54:51.685
- Slow down, Mr. Sidwell.
- They think we have their money!

54:51.760 --> 54:54.889
What money?

54:54.960 --> 54:58.646
From the robbery yesterday
in Baton Rouge.

55:22.600 --> 55:24.602
Get them!

55:29.720 --> 55:31.802
Dad, there's no way.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.522
Dad!

55:41.840 --> 55:44.002
Hang on!

56:19.440 --> 56:22.250
Get down, everybody!

56:34.560 --> 56:37.484
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

56:47.320 --> 56:49.288
Fuck!

56:57.080 --> 56:59.606
Nate!

57:06.040 --> 57:11.001
- Nate, where are you going?
- I don't know. Anywhere.

57:11.080 --> 57:13.606
Here!

57:35.640 --> 57:37.768
You alright?

57:40.160 --> 57:43.209
Get the fuck off me, man!

57:44.760 --> 57:48.082
Evers! Come with me. Grab that.

57:48.160 --> 57:52.051
- Baby?
- Just leave me. Go with them.

57:52.120 --> 57:55.647
Look at me. Look at me.

58:00.040 --> 58:05.968
- It's all gone to shit, baby.
- But we're not done yet.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.725
Fuck it. Let's go.

58:08.800 --> 58:16.082
Hey. I'm not going to lose.
Not to this guy.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.928
- See anything?
- No. Nothing yet.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.764
Alright.

59:42.480 --> 59:45.324
Watch your backs.

59:55.320 --> 59:58.563
- Get your ass down!
- Dad, look! There!

59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.769
Is that the boat
you were talking about?

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.442
Yeah. I think so.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.285
- Are you okay?
- Is that the guy?

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.250
Shane. Damn it! Shane!

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.250
Hey. Where's the money?
The bag of money, you took it!

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.766
What are you talking about?

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:25.164
- Pardon me. We need your help.
- You didn't find a bag of money?

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.641
Forget about the money!

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.685
Are you accusing me of something?

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.288
Sir... I'm sorry.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:44.003
We need your help. Please.
Some guys are trying to kill us.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.086
Could you just take us out of here?
Please? For my family.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.841
I did see a black car over there
driving up and down the highway.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.884
Let me call the Sheriff.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.449
Let's go, stay down!

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.886
Fucking great.
Now they've got a radio!

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.921
You'd get further in life if you
thought before opening your mouth.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.167
Really? A lot further?
You're so smart, get out of this one.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.491
We've followed your fucking lead.
And this is where you lead us!

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.651
This is not you, Evers.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.929
I just want my cut, Marek.
I don't care how I get it.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.846
You fucked this up!
You and that fucking bitch!

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.922
We had to pass the roadblock.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.083
She got out of their car!
She let them get away!

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.607
She fucks it up every time.
You stand there like a fool.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.763
You've seen her knee. That's broken.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:33.769
You still need us. We don't need you.
We don't need you at all.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.530
Wait! Wait, wait.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.123
Do me a favor,
when you get the money?

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.488
- What's that?
- Choke on it!

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.403
Baby, look away.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.607
Alright? Did you get
what you fucking wanted?

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:34.682
If we're done fucking around,
I suggest we go get our money.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.043
Keep an eye out.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.323
Shane! Damn it! Stay in the boat!

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.847
- Let me help, Dad.
- I've got it. You listen to me!

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.129
- You piece of shit!
- No, stop it!

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.091
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.369
Dad. You still don't get it.
Don't you see what you've done?

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.046
This is your fault.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:10.202
- They're coming. I've got to go.
- Nate? Where are you going?

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.006
You watch your mouth, okay?

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.201
Here they come. Go! Go!

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.285
It's empty!

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.327
Okay, take the boat.
Keep Daddy alive.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.290
And one more for leverage.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.763
Is this like a shrimps place?

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.366
Kenny, come on.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.044
Shit.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:22.121
Hello? Hello, is anybody there?

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.249
Anybody? Fuck.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.809
- Maintenance dispatch, who is this?
- I'm Shane Sidwell.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.690
My family's in trouble,
we need the police.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.644
He's okay.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.247
Kenny, maybe he went to
give them the money back, or...

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.970
What are you doing?

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.725
What are you doing?

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.846
- Oh, shit!
- Don't touch that. Don't touch that!

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.645
Mom, what is it?

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:42.648
- We didn't believe him.
- Oh my God.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.243
Where is it?

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.608
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.282
- I lost it.
- Where's your family?

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.291
Where's yours?

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:22.566
If you don't give me my money,
lam going to kill you.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.406
- I know.
- So what are you doing?

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.249
Fixing the screen door.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.405
- Shane? Come in, Shane.
- I'm here. I'm right here.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.405
Police are on their way,
will be there in half an hour.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.007
- No, no. Mom. Mom!
- We're going to give them the money.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.689
Dad was right. They won't let us go.
We saw them kill a fucking cop.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.481
That money is keeping us alive.
We have to make a stand.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.321
Kenny, get in there.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.170
Sounds like
we just found your family.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.560
- We have to keep one of them alive.
- They shot me!

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.889
Oh fuck!

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.648
- They've got the money inside!
- That's right, we've got it!

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.688
We'll burn every last dollar
unless you back off.

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.330
- We can't let them go.
- Fuck!

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.089
They're inside.
They've got the money.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.690
Motherfucker.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.566
We've got Daddy!

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.690
He's alive.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.924
- Get out of this fucking car.
- Get out.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.808
Throw out the money,
or I'll blow his fucking head off!

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.809
- You have three seconds.
- No, Shane! No!

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.690
- One!
- No, no! Shane!

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.604
- Two!
- You have to give it to them!

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.729
- We don't have a choice.
- Three!

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.008
Wait, wait. Wait.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.324
Let him go.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.125
Like hell.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.929
Get down.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.730
Watch your back.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.641
Come on. Come on. Go!

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.883
- Go!
- Here they come!

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.446
Don't fucking move!

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.285
Don't fucking move.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.722
Easy.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.446
You've got nowhere left to run.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.442
No!

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.923
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.601
Dad. Dad!

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.609
Kenny.
