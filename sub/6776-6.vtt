01:57.260 --> 01:59.649
SO, C'MON UP ON THE FLOOR
ALL YOU BAD BOYS...

02:02.230 --> 02:04.892
( loud chattering )

02:12.800 --> 02:14.119
OVER THERE !

02:14.130 --> 02:15.449
I JUST SAW A FIN.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.928
IN THE MOST POLLUTED
PORT IN AMERICA ?

02:17.930 --> 02:19.921
NOTHING COULD
LIVE HERE.

02:19.930 --> 02:20.999
REALLY ?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.820
THAT MAKES ME SAD.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.627
IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL
AT NIGHT.

02:24.630 --> 02:26.723
YEAH, WELL,
SO IS BURBANK.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.952
YOU'RE GORGEOUS,
YOU KNOW THAT ?

02:29.960 --> 02:31.325
SHUT UP.

02:31.330 --> 02:32.991
SO, WHY HAVEN'T YOU
EVER TALKED TO ME BEFORE ?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.422
I WAS INTIMIDATED.

02:34.430 --> 02:36.250
YOU'RE VERY
INTIMIDATING.

02:36.260 --> 02:38.125
AND FULL OF SHIT.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.498
OF COURSE THEY PICK
A GODDAMN BOAT THIS YEAR

02:43.500 --> 02:47.925
SO, NOBODY CAN LEAVE BEFORE
PARKINSON'S JERK-OFF SPEECH

02:47.930 --> 02:51.127
ABOUT WHAT A FUCKING GREAT
COMPANY THIS IS, RIGHT ?

02:51.130 --> 02:52.859
RIGHT.

02:52.860 --> 02:55.420
LIKE ANYTHING THAT
SELF-IMPORTANT FUCK SAYS

02:55.430 --> 02:57.625
CAN CHANGE THE FACT THAT
WE'LL BE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY

02:57.630 --> 02:59.518
BY THE END
OF THE YEAR.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.294
YOU'RE NEW HERE,
AREN'T YOU ?

03:02.300 --> 03:03.756
YEAH, ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.990
WELL, I'D START SENDING OUT
MY RESUME NOW,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.391
UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF PARKINSON'S
FUCKING INNER CIRCLE,

03:10.400 --> 03:12.891
IF YOU ARE,
WELL, THEN...

03:12.900 --> 03:15.789
FUCK ME, RIGHT ?

03:17.330 --> 03:19.594
DO YOU WANT TO GO
AND GET ANOTHER DRINK ?

03:19.600 --> 03:20.726
PLEASE.

03:20.730 --> 03:21.924
OH.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.251
OH, EXCUSE ME.

03:24.260 --> 03:27.593
I GUESS I'M THE ASSHOLE FOR
TELLING THE FUCKING TRUTH !

03:27.600 --> 03:29.693
OH SHIT !

03:30.430 --> 03:32.398
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.449
YOU SUCK !

03:50.830 --> 03:51.854
MORNING !

03:51.860 --> 03:53.589
GOD, YOU SCARED ME.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.329
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

03:55.330 --> 03:58.151
YOU SLEPT
LIKE A FUCKING BABY.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.855
YEAH, ME TOO.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.191
AFTER THE NIGHT
WE HAD ?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.851
THE SHEER EXHAUSTION
FACTOR ALONE.

04:03.860 --> 04:06.021
YEAH, I GO'I'I'A SAY,
IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.724
SO, DOES THIS MEAN
THE EBB IS OVER ?

04:08.730 --> 04:10.254
FOR NOW.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.090
YOU WANT A COFFEE ?

04:11.100 --> 04:11.919
YEP.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.058
WOW, THIS IS
KINDA RACY.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.948
HEY, HEY, NO !

04:18.960 --> 04:20.393
IS THAT YOUR NOVEL ?

04:20.400 --> 04:21.890
I'M DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS YET.

04:21.900 --> 04:23.720
WHEN DO I
GET TO READ IT ?

04:23.730 --> 04:24.992
WHEN IT'S READY.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.353
IF IT'S EVER READY.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.850
WELL, NOW WHO'S
"CHRISTINA"

04:27.860 --> 04:29.794
IS THAT LIKE
YOUR FICTIONAL ALTER-EGO ?

04:29.800 --> 04:30.824
YOUR HOLDEN CAULFIELD ?

04:30.830 --> 04:34.596
SHE'S MORE LIKE
MY HUMBERT HUMBERT.

04:36.230 --> 04:39.620
MY CONSTANCE CHA'I'I'ERLY ?

04:41.100 --> 04:43.557
SHE'S LIKE HERMIONE
IN THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.027
WHAT WOULD
YOU RATHER HAVE,

04:45.030 --> 04:47.658
SOME OVERLY EDUCATED
GASBAG LIKE TREVOR ?

04:47.660 --> 04:50.299
OR A SEMI-LITERATE
FUCK MACHINE LIKE ME, C'MON ?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.790
THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.199
NO PUN INTENDED.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.057
HEY, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.055
I KNOW IT'S SMALL,
BUT IT IS A DIAMOND.

05:04.060 --> 05:05.994
YOU THINK I CARE
ABOUT DIAMONDS ?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.026
WILL YOU MARRY ME,
BRENDA CHENOWITH ?

05:09.030 --> 05:11.828
HAVEN'T WE DONE
THIS ALREADY ?

05:16.630 --> 05:18.291
WHAT ?

05:18.300 --> 05:19.528
I LOVE YOU.

05:19.530 --> 05:22.852
GOOD.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.754
SOMETHING ELSE ?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.957
I THOUGHT WE COULD ANNOUNCE IT
TO MY FAMILY AT DINNER TONIGHT.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.120
OH, NATE--

05:31.130 --> 05:32.722
I WAS GONNA ASK MOM
TO MAKE DINNER.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.618
LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO
THIS SOME TIME.

05:34.630 --> 05:37.121
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY ?

05:37.130 --> 05:38.358
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

05:38.360 --> 05:40.749
THEY'RE WAY TOO CONSUMED
IN THEIR OWN DIVORCE DRAMA

05:40.760 --> 05:42.057
TO EVEN NOTICE.

05:42.060 --> 05:44.324
LET'S JUST NOT TELL THEM
AND SAY THAT WE DID.

05:44.330 --> 05:45.957
WHAT ABOUT BILLY ?

05:45.960 --> 05:49.259
I HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED
TO HIM FOR A WHILE.

05:49.260 --> 05:52.491
HEY, WHY DON'T
I MAKE YOU

05:52.500 --> 05:54.752
PANCAKES FROM SCRATCH

05:54.760 --> 05:56.455
LIKE A GOOD LI'I'I'LE WIFE-TO-BE
BEFORE I FUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT

05:56.460 --> 05:58.098
AND SEND YOU
OFF TO THE OFFICE ?

05:58.100 --> 06:00.193
HOW ABOUT WE SKIP
THE PANCAKES ?

06:07.230 --> 06:08.720
SHIT, YOU'RE
ALREADY DRESSED !

06:08.730 --> 06:10.152
AM I HOLDING YOU UP ?

06:10.160 --> 06:11.627
NO, NOT REALLY.

06:11.630 --> 06:13.188
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.758
YOU'VE GOT
THE BEST SHOWER.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.058
MINE'S JUST THIS WEIRD BOLT
STICKING OUT OF THE WALL

06:17.060 --> 06:18.891
THAT SENDS OUT MIST.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.118
IT TAKES LIKE FIVE MINUTES
JUST TO GET WET.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.553
HEY, HOW COME
I ALWAYS STAY HERE ?

06:23.560 --> 06:25.790
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO STAY AT MY PLACE.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.688
AFI'ER THAT GREAT
RECOMMENDATION ?

06:27.700 --> 06:29.497
IT'S NICE.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.298
M.G.M. BUILT IT BACK
IN THE 305 TO HOUSE STARLETS.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.189
GREAT PARQUET FLOORS
AND UNBELIEVABLE MOLDING,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.156
BUT SOME IDIOT
DID AN 805 RETRO-FIT

06:37.160 --> 06:40.618
AND RIPPED OUT
ALL THE GOOD FIXTURES.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.059
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO STAY AT YOUR HOUSE,

06:44.060 --> 06:46.426
FIXTURES ASIDE.

06:49.730 --> 06:51.925
YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D CALL ME BACK

06:51.930 --> 06:52.999
AFI'ER THAT SECOND DATE.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.922
WHY ?

06:54.930 --> 06:57.194
BECAUSE I NEVER THINK
THE GOOD GUYS
ARE GONNA CALL BACK.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.020
WHO SAID
I'M A GOOD GUY ?

06:59.030 --> 07:01.726
IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS,
THAT'S USUALLY A SIGN.

07:01.730 --> 07:03.254
CHECK WITH ME
IN THREE MONTHS,

07:03.260 --> 07:05.228
I'LL TELL YOU
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.651
AH, GOOD MORNING,
SIT, SIT.

07:15.660 --> 07:16.820
HAVE SOME BREAKFAST.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.821
MOST IMPORTANT
MEAL OF THE DAY.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.559
GOOD MORNING, DEAR.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.949
APPARENTLY.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.657
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE YOUR EGGS ?

07:25.660 --> 07:27.298
UHH...

07:27.300 --> 07:28.756
SURPRISE ME.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.396
NOW, THIS IS GOOD, YES ?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.789
ALL TOGETHER
FOR BREAKFAST.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.322
WELL, I SEE IT'S
GOOD NEIGHBOR DAY
AT THE FISHER HOUSE.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.422
DAVID, WAS THAT A NEW FRIEND
I SAW LEAVING THIS MORNING ?

07:44.430 --> 07:46.489
MOM, PLEASE,
I'D RATHER NOT DISCUSS--

07:46.500 --> 07:47.899
WHAT DOES HE DO ?

07:47.900 --> 07:49.595
HE'S A PUBLIC DEFENDER.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.090
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIM
IN FOR BREAKFAST.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.158
WE'D ALL LIKE
TO MEET HIM.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.923
YES, BRING HIM
NEXT TIME.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.352
I WOULD LIKE
TO MEET HIM.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.022
WHERE'S NATE ?

07:58.030 --> 07:59.657
WE HAVE AN INTAKE
IN 15 MINUTES.

07:59.660 --> 08:02.094
HE CALLED FROM THE CAR,
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT ON THE 10

08:02.100 --> 08:05.251
AND HE TOLD ME TO ASK EVERYONE
TO BE HERE FOR DINNER TONIGHT,

08:05.260 --> 08:08.798
HE HAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT
TO TELL US.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.721
A BIG FAMILY DINNER.

08:11.730 --> 08:13.721
WILL BE FUN, YEAH ?

08:13.730 --> 08:15.595
( laughing )

08:16.830 --> 08:18.388
EVERYBODY HAD
GO'I'I'EN OFF,

08:18.400 --> 08:20.197
AND THE LIGHTS WERE ON,

08:20.200 --> 08:23.829
AND YOU COULD SEE WHAT A DUMPY
LITTLE BOAT IT ACTUALLY WAS,

08:23.830 --> 08:26.458
AND...

08:28.000 --> 08:30.696
AND HE JUST
WASN'T THERE.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.588
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
RIGHT NOW, BUT TIME--

08:32.600 --> 08:34.454
I GOT DUMPED AT A PARTY,
IN COLLEGE ONCE,

08:34.460 --> 08:36.451
THE KAPPA SIG LUAU BY...

08:36.460 --> 08:40.191
SOME GUY WHOSE NAME
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

08:41.530 --> 08:43.327
THE SUN WAS COMING UP
AND I JUST SAT THERE

08:43.330 --> 08:47.653
STARING AT THIS
STUPID PIG CARCASS

08:47.660 --> 08:50.254
IN MY STUPID HAWAIIAN
PRINT SUN DRESS.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.155
MRS. COLLINS,
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT--

08:55.160 --> 08:57.219
MATTHEW AND I HAD BEEN MARRIED
FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS,

08:57.230 --> 08:59.255
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ?

09:01.360 --> 09:03.453
I MET HIM WHEN
I WAS BARELY 20.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.858
AND NOW, HE'S DEAD AND...

09:10.830 --> 09:13.719
I'M JUST THAT
MUCH CLOSER TO IT.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.152
I'M SORRY, WE DON'T
ALLOW SMOKING INSIDE.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.424
PLEASE, PUT THAT OUT.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.352
IT'S AGAINST
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.349
WE COULD BE FINED.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.295
OH...

09:35.660 --> 09:37.196
SORRY.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.354
HOW LONG
WILL IT TAKE ?

09:41.360 --> 09:43.920
IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF
SERVICE YOU WERE THINKING OF.

09:43.930 --> 09:45.249
LENGTH OF VISITATION,

09:45.260 --> 09:46.659
SHOULD YOU
CHOOSE AN OPEN CASKET--

09:46.660 --> 09:48.924
MY HUSBAND WAS DREDGED UP
FROM LONG BEACH HARBOR

09:48.930 --> 09:51.649
WITH A PROPELLER SLICED
HALF WAY DOWN HIS BODY.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.958
CLOSED CASKET THEN.

09:55.860 --> 09:56.952
HOW MUCH ?

09:56.960 --> 09:59.121
I CAN'T
SPEND A LOT OF MONEY.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.291
WE'RE PROBABLY
LOOKING AT AROUND $7,000.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.928
THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.557
IT'S ABOUT AVERAGE,

10:05.560 --> 10:06.959
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.393
WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING,

10:08.400 --> 10:10.789
AND MAKE IT AS EASY
ON YOU AS POSSIBLE.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.722
WELL...

10:14.800 --> 10:16.893
I NEED TO THINK
ABOUT THIS.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.323
OF COURSE.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.695
LET US KNOW
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.019
I CAN SHOW MYSELF OUT.

10:25.660 --> 10:27.298
SHOPPING AROUND
FOR THE BEST DEAL.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.949
ISN'T THAT HER RIGHT ?

10:28.960 --> 10:31.394
SHE'S WASTING OUR TIME.

10:37.030 --> 10:39.157
OH DEAR, WHEN DID
YOU GET SO DRIED OUT ?

10:39.160 --> 10:41.219
YOU MUST BE THIRSTY.

10:50.430 --> 10:53.752
THE FLOWERS ARE LOVELY,
SARAH, THANK YOU.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.853
I JUST CUT THEM ON MY MORNING
WALK THROUGH THE CANYON.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.396
DON'T WORRY, YOU DIDN'T
PUT ME OUT ONE BIT.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.427
THIS KITCHEN
IS EXACTLY THE SAME.

11:01.430 --> 11:03.557
YES, IT IS.

11:05.530 --> 11:06.656
YOU LOOK WELL.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.651
SO, DO YOU.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.457
I ONLY JUST
GOT YOUR MESSAGES.

11:10.460 --> 11:11.757
I WAS IN MADRID.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.125
I WANTED TO STAY
THROUGH CHRISTMAS,

11:13.130 --> 11:14.620
BUT I RAN
OUT OF MONEY.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.825
THE REASON I WAS
CALLING WAS BECAUSE,

11:16.830 --> 11:18.388
WELL...

11:18.400 --> 11:21.028
WHAT I'VE WANTED
TO SAY WAS I...

11:21.030 --> 11:24.090
I FORGIVE YOU.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.592
YOU'RE THE ONLY FAMILY,
APART FROM THE CHILDREN,

11:27.600 --> 11:29.192
THAT I HAVE LEFI'.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.225
I DIDN'T WANT MORE TIME
TO GO BY WITH OUR NOT TALKING.

11:31.230 --> 11:34.324
WE'RE SISTERS,
WE SHOULDN'T BE ESTRANGED.

11:34.330 --> 11:39.120
I TOOK THIS COURSE
CALLED THE PLAN--

11:39.130 --> 11:40.825
YOU DID THE PLAN ?

11:40.830 --> 11:42.491
YOU'RE SHI'I'I'ING ME.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.593
THAT IS SO GREAT,
RUTH !

11:44.600 --> 11:46.295
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE !

11:46.300 --> 11:47.892
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.128
NO, IT'S VERY BRAVE.

11:49.130 --> 11:50.392
I KNOW IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN EASY FOR YOU.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.049
I DID IT MYSELF,
BACK IN THE 705,

11:52.060 --> 11:54.722
WHEN IT WAS STILL CALLED
TRANSITIONAL FOCUS,

11:54.730 --> 11:57.597
BEFORE ERNST VOLLHOFFER
WAS BUSTED FOR TAX EVASION

11:57.600 --> 11:59.352
AND SOLD IT
TO THE CANADIANS.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.590
THAT'S WHEN IT
BECAME THE PLAN.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.897
OH.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.551
I MET VOLLHOFFER
AT A PARTY ONCE

12:05.560 --> 12:07.858
AND HE CAME ON TO ME,

12:07.860 --> 12:11.455
BUT I HAD JUST DROPPED ACID
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

12:11.460 --> 12:15.556
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS
SOME MAYAN DEATH PRIEST,

12:15.560 --> 12:17.619
WHO WANTED TO CUT OUT
MY HEART AND...

12:17.630 --> 12:19.757
THROW IT INTO A PIT.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.955
SO, I BLEW HIM OFF.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.655
( laughing )

12:28.460 --> 12:31.657
CATHERINE COLLINS HAS DECIDED
TO GO WITH THE UNGER MORTUARY.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.651
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S THAT.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.491
UNGER IS
A KROEHNER HOME, NATE.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.923
YEAH, SO ?

12:37.930 --> 12:41.525
SO, KROEHNER CHARGES
ABOUT DOUBLE WHAT WE DO.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.822
THAT'S THE THIRD FUNERAL
KROEHNER HAS STOLEN FROM US,

12:45.830 --> 12:47.718
SINCE MITZI HUNTLEY
CAME TO VISIT.

12:47.730 --> 12:48.924
THEY'RE AFI'ER US AGAIN.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.352
OH, LOOK, NOW,
YOU'RE JUST BEING DRAMATIC.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.920
THIS FROM A MAN WHO
BASICALLY LIVES IN DENIAL.

12:52.930 --> 12:54.955
HEY, LOOK.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.825
STAN TOLD ME AT LUNCH
LAST WEEK THAT KROEHNER STOCK

12:56.830 --> 12:58.627
HAD TAKEN A NOSE-DIVE.

12:58.630 --> 12:59.892
WHY WOULD THEY BE
WASTING THEIR TIME

12:59.900 --> 13:01.128
WITH SMALL POTATOES
LIKE US ?

13:01.130 --> 13:02.552
UH, MAYBE BECAUSE
YOU TOLD MITZI

13:02.560 --> 13:04.755
TO SHOVE HER GESTURE
OF GOOD FAITH UP HER ASS ?

13:04.760 --> 13:06.819
I TOLD YOU GUYS THAT KROEHNER
WASN'T GONNA LET UP,

13:06.830 --> 13:09.390
BUT NOBODY
LISTENS TO ME.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.924
NOT NOW, FEDERICO.

13:10.930 --> 13:12.488
WE NEEDED THAT FUNERAL.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.491
HOW ELSE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO PAY
FOR THE FINE FROM THE D-C-A ?

13:14.500 --> 13:17.151
THAT'S $1,800
WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.855
HEY, I ASKED YOU
TO CHECK THE PROOF--

13:18.860 --> 13:21.988
NO LICENSE NUMBER ON A BILLBOARD
OPPOSITE A RETIREMENT HOME

13:22.000 --> 13:23.422
MAKES US LOOK
LIKE AMATEURS.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.091
WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO BE VULNERABLE.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.795
DAVID, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
STARTING ON THIS WOMAN'S PERM

13:26.800 --> 13:28.051
UNTIL I HAVE A PHOTO.

13:28.060 --> 13:29.459
FINE.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.098
YEAH, WELL, ANY IDEA WHEN
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE ?

13:31.100 --> 13:33.523
I HAVE AN INSPECTOR COMING OUT
TO MY HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON--

13:33.530 --> 13:36.351
IT CAME THIS MORNING
AND I PUT IT IN HER FILE,

13:36.360 --> 13:39.022
WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW,
IF YOU BOTHERED TO LOOK !

13:41.400 --> 13:43.425
I'M CALLING CATHERINE COLLINS
AND I'M GOING TO LOWBALL UNGER.

13:43.430 --> 13:46.228
EVEN IF WE CUT
OUR PROFITS IN HALF,

13:46.230 --> 13:48.721
WE CAN STILL SHOW KROEHNER
WE'RE WILLING TO FIGHT.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.056
HI, MOM.

14:00.060 --> 14:01.857
HELLO.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.896
WHO ARE YOU ?

14:03.900 --> 14:05.697
I'M YOUR AUNT SARAH.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.759
OH, CLAIRE !

14:07.760 --> 14:11.821
THE GODDESS IS CLEARLY
MANIFESTING THROUGH YOU,

14:11.830 --> 14:13.127
IT'S VERY OBVIOUS.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.392
THAN KS.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.960
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.594
OH, THE SKIN.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.726
LIKE MILK !

14:21.730 --> 14:23.493
TREASURE IT
WHILE IT LASTS.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.425
RUTH, YOU TOLD YOUR DAUGHTER
I WAS DEAD ?

14:27.430 --> 14:29.455
SHAME ON YOU.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.291
I NEVER TOLD HER
ANY SUCH THING !

14:31.300 --> 14:33.655
CLAIRE, WHY WOULD
YOU LIE ABOUT THAT ?

14:33.660 --> 14:35.651
WHENEVER YOU TALKED
ABOUT HER,

14:35.660 --> 14:37.321
IT JUST SOUNDED
LIKE SHE WAS DEAD.

14:37.330 --> 14:38.854
I JUST ASSUMED.

14:38.860 --> 14:41.920
WELL, I'VE MADE
A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.352
OH.

14:49.060 --> 14:52.757
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE
FEELING WHEN YOU MADE THIS.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.194
BO RE DOM .
LIAR.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.089
THERE'S ANGER,
AND YEARNING.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.795
PASSION.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.893
RESENTMENT OF THE STATUS QUO,
SOME JEALOUSY OF IT AS WELL.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.949
NOT THE MOST ORIGINAL
PERSPECTIVE,

15:04.960 --> 15:07.121
BUT IT'S AUTHENTIC.

15:07.130 --> 15:09.621
OOH, I LOVE THIS.

15:09.630 --> 15:13.020
THE TECHNIQUE !

15:13.030 --> 15:15.453
VERY PRECISE,
VERY ADULT.

15:15.460 --> 15:19.419
THE DEATH OF ROMANCE
IN A REGIMENTED,

15:19.430 --> 15:20.988
ARTIFICIAL WORLD.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.399
LOVELY.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.153
ACTUALLY, I FOUND IT
IN THE GARBAGE,

15:25.160 --> 15:26.923
MY DAD THREW IT OUT
AFTER A FUNERAL.

15:26.930 --> 15:29.649
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED COOL,
SO, I KEPT IT.

15:31.300 --> 15:34.258
YOU'RE AN ARTIST,
CLAIRE.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.591
OH, PLEASE.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.999
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE ANY GOOD.

15:37.000 --> 15:37.898
YET.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.697
BUT IF YOU FOCUS
AND LIVE FULLY,

15:39.700 --> 15:41.554
YOU COULD
BECOME SOMETHING.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.391
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
AND DON'T SELF-DESTRUCT.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.924
RIGHT.

15:44.930 --> 15:46.158
YOU'VE GOT AN EYE.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.855
YOU SEE
THROUGH THE VEIL.

15:47.860 --> 15:49.259
OH...

15:49.260 --> 15:51.854
IT'S A BLESSING
AND A CURSE.

15:51.860 --> 15:54.328
OKAY.

15:54.330 --> 15:57.925
YOU NEED SOMETHING RED
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP CORNER.

15:57.930 --> 16:00.854
LIKE A RED
VELVET PILLOW,

16:00.860 --> 16:03.624
SOMETHING BORDELLO-Y.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.655
YOU'RE RESISTING
THE CARNAL,

16:05.660 --> 16:07.196
THAT'S YOUR MOTHER
RUBBING OFF ON YOU.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.452
AND PUT A PLANT
IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE CORNER,

16:09.460 --> 16:11.155
IF YOU WANT TO GROW
INTO YOUR POTENTIAL.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.993
WHAT IS THAT,
LIKE FENG-SHUI ?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.649
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT ?

16:15.660 --> 16:17.924
YOU CAN DROP
THE GENERIC APATHY CRAP,

16:17.930 --> 16:20.558
THAT'S JUST LAZINESS.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.449
YOU'RE MORE THAN THAT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.622
HEY, BABY !

16:27.630 --> 16:29.291
SORRY, I'M LATE.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.120
RICO, WE ARE FUCKED.

16:31.130 --> 16:32.791
IT'S DEFINITELY MOLD.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.427
I TOLD YOU SO.

16:34.430 --> 16:35.988
SEE, THIS IS WHY JULIO'S COLD
DON'T GET ANY BETTER !

16:36.000 --> 16:37.922
MY GUESS IS YOU GOT
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE
IN YOUR CHIMNEY

16:37.930 --> 16:39.727
AND WATER'S
LEAKING IN SOMEWHERE.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.459
WHEN THE RAIN STARTS,
IT'LL GET WORSE.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.496
OKAY, WHAT CAN WE DO ?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.525
WELL, I GOTTA RIP THIS ALL OUT
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.556
MAYBE WE CAN PATCH THINGS UP,
MAYBE IT'LL BE BIGGER THAN THAT.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.721
HOW MUCH IS IT
ALL GONNA COST ?

16:50.730 --> 16:52.391
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
SERIOUS WATER DAMAGE.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.288
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE
FROM THREE TO, I DON'T KNOW,

16:54.300 --> 16:56.359
MAYBE SEVEN GRAND
IF YOUR ROOF IS INVOLVED.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.499
( speaking Spanish )

16:58.500 --> 17:00.127
EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.

17:00.130 --> 17:03.224
WE CAN GET
RAMON TO FIX IT.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.390
FIX IT ?

17:04.400 --> 17:05.958
HE DIDN'T
EVEN SPOT IT.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.450
YOU HEARD THE MAN,
THERE'S SERIOUS WATER DAMAGE,

17:07.460 --> 17:08.791
ANY IDIOT WOULD
KNOW THAT.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.620
HEY, HEY, DON'T CALL
MY COUSIN AN IDIOT.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.257
OH, OKAY, NO,
I'LL CALL YOU AN IDIOT

17:12.260 --> 17:13.352
BECAUSE YOU WERE
TOO CHEAP

17:13.360 --> 17:15.396
TO GET A REAL INSPECTOR
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.628
OH, I'M AN IDIOT ?

17:16.630 --> 17:18.291
WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T
THE SMARTEST IDEA

17:18.300 --> 17:19.449
TO GO TO YOUR SISTER

17:19.460 --> 17:21.496
AND BUY THIS PIECE-OF-SHIT
HOUSE BEHIND MY BACK.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.297
NOW, YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT !

17:26.800 --> 17:28.620
GODDAMN IT.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.029
( male on phone )
What happened ?

17:30.030 --> 17:31.998
I JUST GOT SNAPPED
RUNNING A RED LIGHT.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.298
WE ARE LIVING
IN A MOTHERFUCKING POLICE STATE,

17:34.300 --> 17:35.426
I TELL YOU WHAT.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.523
ANY CALLS
WHILE I WAS AT LUNCH ?

17:37.530 --> 17:39.191
The Unger Mortuary
called to say,

17:39.200 --> 17:41.054
the funeral we poached
from Fisher and Sons

17:41.060 --> 17:42.391
has gone back to them.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.129
YOU'RE KIDDING.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.327
WE UNDERCUT THEM
BY ALMOST $500.

17:47.330 --> 17:49.252
Well, now, they've undercut
us by nearly a grand.

17:49.260 --> 17:52.923
OH MY GOD,
I LOVE THIS.

17:52.930 --> 17:56.889
THEY'RE CUTE, BUT THEY'RE
SUCH BAD BUSINESSMEN.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.652
They won't last.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.118
HEY, WHAT HAVE
I GOT TOMORROW ?

18:02.130 --> 18:04.325
Your trainer
at nine,

18:04.330 --> 18:06.821
then back to back
performance reVIews
from one to five.

18:06.830 --> 18:09.890
CANCEL EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THE TRAINER.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.128
Alright.

18:11.130 --> 18:12.654
I THINK I NEED TO SPEND
A LITTLE QUALITY TIME

18:12.660 --> 18:15.220
WITH THE FABULOUS
FISHER BOYS.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.998
RUTH, DO YOU
HAVE ANY TARRAGON ?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.729
ALL THE SPICES
ARE IN THAT CABINET.

18:20.730 --> 18:24.621
WELL, NOW I KNOW WHAT
TO GET YOU FOR CHRISTMAS.

18:24.630 --> 18:29.351
DEAN AND DELUCA HAVE THESE
FANTASTIC SPICES IN TEST TUBES.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.453
VERY MAD SCIENTIST,
YOU'LL LOVE THEM.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.189
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING ?

18:33.200 --> 18:34.622
I'M NOT SURE YET.

18:34.630 --> 18:36.222
I'M MAKING
CHICKEN KIEV.

18:36.230 --> 18:38.858
I BOUGHT ALL THE INGREDIENTS
TO MAKE CHICKEN KIEV.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.452
SO, WE'LL MAKE
CHICKEN KIEV.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.121
AHA !

18:42.130 --> 18:44.121
HAVE TARRAGON,
WILL TRAVEL !

18:44.130 --> 18:47.429
TARRAGON IS NOT LISTED
IN THE INGREDIENTS.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.422
FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS,
WHERE'S THE CREATIVITY IN THAT ?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.489
COOKING IS ALCHEMY,
NOT A SCIENCE.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.297
IT IS IF YOU WANT IT
TO TURN OUT RIGHT !

18:54.300 --> 18:56.928
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP ?

18:57.960 --> 18:59.393
SMELL.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.890
MMM.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.152
MMM.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.895
THIS VODKA IS
FROM POLAND.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.094
YOU WILL LIKE IT.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.092
RUTHIE, WHY DON'T
YOU JOIN US ?

19:11.100 --> 19:12.624
THANK YOU, NIKOLAI,
BUT I'LL WAIT 'TIL

19:12.630 --> 19:14.325
DINNER IS SERVED
TO HAVE A GLASS OF WINE.

19:14.330 --> 19:15.854
OKAY, SUIT YOURSELF.

19:15.860 --> 19:17.350
NAZDAROVJE.

19:17.360 --> 19:22.127
( singing in Russian )

19:35.360 --> 19:37.726
WHERE ARE YOU LEARNING
TO SPEAK THE RUSSIAN ?

19:37.730 --> 19:39.823
IT'S A LONG STORY.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.252
LET'S JUST SAY
THERE WAS A MAN INVOLVED.

19:41.260 --> 19:42.818
OF COURSE THERE WAS.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.856
CLAIRE, WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED
MIXING THE HERBS IN,

19:45.860 --> 19:48.795
YOU WANT TO FORM THE BUTTER
INTO LITTLE LOGS,

19:48.800 --> 19:49.824
EIGHT OF THEM.

19:49.830 --> 19:50.854
EW.

19:50.860 --> 19:53.192
NO, NOT AT ALL,
IT'S DELICIOUSLY SENSUAL.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.452
WASH YOUR HANDS FIRST,
CLAIRE.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.718
RUTH,

19:58.730 --> 20:01.324
YOU WILD WOMAN !

20:01.330 --> 20:04.549
NIKOLAI IS ADORABLE
AND HOT.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.996
THE SEX MUST
BE SPECTACULAR.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.298
GOOD FOR YOU.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.358
OH, MY GOD !

20:14.360 --> 20:16.692
OH!

20:20.130 --> 20:23.122
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP, BUT YOUR
FACE IS STILL 12 YEARS OLD.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.621
DAVID, YOU REMEMBER
YOUR AUNT SARAH.

20:25.630 --> 20:27.791
UH, YES.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.949
HI.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.451
I'M SURE YOU COULDN'T
FORGET HER IF YOU TRIED.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.394
DAVID, HAVE SOME VODKA.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.220
YES.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.691
THIS IS SO SURREAL.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.895
"THE ENGAGEMENT DINNER"

20:40.900 --> 20:42.697
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN A TRAINING MOVIE

20:42.700 --> 20:45.351
FROM THE 505 ABOUT
HOW NORMAL PEOPLE BEHAVE.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.726
MY FAMILY IS ANYTHING,
BUT NORMAL.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.789
COMPARED TO MINE,
THEY'RE THE FUCKING CLEAVERS.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.859
JUST RELAX,
ENJOY YOURSELF, ALRIGHT ?

20:51.860 --> 20:54.226
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS,
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU--

20:54.230 --> 20:55.527
NOT YOUR MOTHER.

20:55.530 --> 20:56.292
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

20:56.300 --> 20:57.619
IS SIT BACK

20:57.630 --> 20:59.450
AND BE THE CENTER
OF ATTENTION.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.599
ALRIGHT, C'MON.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.125
SO, LINDA,
WHAT DO YOU DO ?

21:07.130 --> 21:08.859
IT'S BRENDA.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.828
FORGIVE ME,
I'M DRUNK.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.991
IT'S ALL
NIKOLAI'S FAULT,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.152
PLYING ME WITH VODKA
SINCE THE MOMENT HE ARRIVED.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.196
I'M A MASSAGE THERAPIST.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.553
OH!

21:20.560 --> 21:22.255
SHE'S AN AMAZING
MASSAGE THERAPIST

21:22.260 --> 21:24.057
AND SHE'S WRITING
A NOVEL.

21:24.060 --> 21:25.698
YOU ARE ?

21:25.700 --> 21:27.895
I'M WRITING SOMETHING,
WE'LL SEE WHAT IT TURNS INTO.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.152
HAVE YOU EVER READ
"CHARLOTTE LIGHT AND DARK" ?

21:30.160 --> 21:31.593
YES.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.454
WELL, SHE'S CHARLOTTE.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.825
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

21:34.830 --> 21:35.899
WHAT IS THIS ?

21:35.900 --> 21:37.356
CHARLOTTE LIGHT AND WHO ?

21:37.360 --> 21:39.499
IT'S THIS BOOK ABOUT THIS GIRL
WHO'S BEING ANALYZED

21:39.500 --> 21:42.094
AND SHE'S LIKE WAY SMARTER
THEN THE PEOPLE ANALYZING HER

21:42.100 --> 21:44.591
AND SO, SHE'S CONSTANTLY
FUCKING WITH THEM,

21:44.600 --> 21:45.749
AND IT'S HILARIOUS.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.159
WELL, WELL, NATE,

21:47.160 --> 21:50.357
YOU CONTINUE TO BE DRAWN
TO STRONG, COMPLEX WOMEN.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.793
BRAVO.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.620
BRAVO.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.222
MOM, THIS DINNER
IS DELICIOUS.

21:57.230 --> 22:00.256
I THINK IT'S
A LITTLE SOUR, MYSELF.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.899
OH, NO, IT'S ONE OF THE BEST
THINGS YOU'VE EVER MADE.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.494
MORE VODKA ?
OH, PLEASE.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.924
I HAD A LOVER
WHO WAS RUSSIAN.

22:08.930 --> 22:11.592
HE ONCE TOLD ME
THAT VODKA

22:11.600 --> 22:14.489
WAS TO RUSSIANS WHAT
THERAPY IS TO AMERICANS.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.798
SOMETHING HABIT-FORMING
AND EXPENSIVE

22:16.800 --> 22:18.859
THAT TOTALLY
DESTROYS YOUR ABILITY

22:18.860 --> 22:21.397
TO LEAD
AN AUTHENTIC LIFE.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.058
SORRY, BOTH MY PARENTS
ARE SHRINKS.

22:26.060 --> 22:29.052
AH, AND THAT WAS
VERY PAINFUL FOR YOU.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.654
BUT IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT,
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T

22:31.660 --> 22:33.423
BE WRITING
YOUR NOVEL, RIGHT ?

22:33.430 --> 22:34.920
SPEAKING OF CREATIVITY,

22:34.930 --> 22:37.592
IS EVERYONE AWARE
OF THE BUDDING ARTIST
IN THE FAMILY ?

22:37.600 --> 22:40.421
YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN CLAIRE'S WORK ?!

22:40.430 --> 22:42.227
SHAME ON YOU !

22:42.230 --> 22:43.720
SHE NEEDS FEEDBACK,

22:43.730 --> 22:45.948
EVEN IF IT'S JUST SO
SHE CAN LEARN TO IGNORE IT.

22:45.960 --> 22:50.021
CLAIRE, I KNOW SO MANY CREATIVE
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

22:50.030 --> 22:52.396
YOU MUST COME STAY WITH ME
IN TOPANGA CANYON

22:52.400 --> 22:54.049
AND MEET SOME OF THEM.

22:54.060 --> 22:55.425
OKAY.

23:01.260 --> 23:03.455
WHAT ?

23:07.700 --> 23:09.190
( clearing throat)

23:09.200 --> 23:11.998
NOW IS A...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.059
GOOD A TIME
AS ANY, I GUESS.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.496
THE REASON THAT I WANTED
US ALL TO GET TOGETHER

23:17.500 --> 23:19.593
FOR DINNER TONIGHT
IS THAT BRENDA AND I...

23:19.600 --> 23:21.056
HAVE DECIDED
TO GET MARRIED !

23:21.060 --> 23:23.153
( Nikolai )
GOOD, A MARRIAGE.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.593
THIS CALLS
FOR A TOAST !

23:24.600 --> 23:26.921
( Sarah )
ABSOLUTELY.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.124
HERE YOU GO,
SOMETHING TO TOAST WITH.

23:30.130 --> 23:32.621
TO ROMANTIC LOVE,

23:32.630 --> 23:36.122
BOTH THE INSPIRATION
AND UTTER FOLLY OF IT.

23:36.130 --> 23:38.348
THANK YOU,

23:38.360 --> 23:40.624
THAT'S REALLY KIND.

23:43.860 --> 23:45.191
SO LINDA,

23:45.200 --> 23:48.454
I NEVER WOULD'VE TAKEN YOU
AS THE TYPE TO GET MARRIED.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.296
SHOW US THE RING !

23:51.300 --> 23:53.518
DON'T BLINK, YOU MIGHT
MISS THE DIAMOND.

23:53.530 --> 23:54.997
HERE YOU GO.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.991
NO, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.956
IT'S LOVELY,
RUTH, DID YOU SEE ?

23:58.960 --> 24:01.690
YES, VERY NICE.

24:01.700 --> 24:05.420
I'LL GO PUT ON
SOME COFFEE.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.524
IS THERE ANYMORE
OF THAT VODKA LEFT ?

24:24.900 --> 24:26.492
RUTHIE, WHAT'S WRONG ?

24:26.500 --> 24:30.425
YOUR SON IS GOING TO MARRY,
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.

24:30.430 --> 24:33.627
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY,
THAT'S ALL, I'M FINE.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.824
JUST LOOK AT THIS MESS !

24:46.830 --> 24:48.821
DON'T WORRY.

24:48.830 --> 24:51.628
I GOING TO HELP YOU
CLEAN UP.

24:51.630 --> 24:53.222
THANK YOU.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.297
GOD, THERE'S SO MUCH
EMOTION TO NAVIGATE

24:57.300 --> 24:58.995
WHERE FAMILY
IS CONCERNED.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.992
VICODIN, ANYONE ?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.049
NO, THANKS,
I'M FINE.

25:05.060 --> 25:08.655
OKAY, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH ME
GOING TO TOPANGA CANYON ?

25:08.660 --> 25:10.958
MOM LIKE,
TOTALLY FREAKED.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.659
NO ONE EVER TOLD YOU ?

25:13.660 --> 25:14.888
OH, MY !

25:14.900 --> 25:19.428
WELL, IT SEEMS
I'M A TERRIBLE INFLUENCE.

25:21.230 --> 25:23.448
DAVID AND I WENT TO STAY
WITH AUNT SARAH ONE WEEKEND

25:23.460 --> 25:25.121
AND I KIND OF
LOST MY VIRGINITY.

25:25.130 --> 25:27.018
HOW OLD WERE YOU ?

25:27.030 --> 25:28.895
15.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.151
HOW OLD WAS SHE ?

25:30.160 --> 25:32.219
I'M NOT SURE,
20-SOMETHING.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.595
SHE WAS 32.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.455
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S TOTALLY FUCKED UP.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.325
YOUR MOTHER HAS
NEVER FORGIVEN ME

25:38.330 --> 25:40.525
AND SHE NEVER WILL,
NO MATTER WHAT SHE SAYS.

25:40.530 --> 25:44.455
GRANTED, THERE WAS AN AWFUL
MOMENT WHEN DAVID WAS LOST,

25:44.460 --> 25:47.759
BUT HE WAS FOUND COMPLETELY
UNHARMED IN THE CANYON

25:47.760 --> 25:49.250
THE NEXT MORNING.

25:49.260 --> 25:52.457
DAMN, I MISS OUT ON ALL
THE BEST STUFF IN THIS FAMILY.

25:52.460 --> 25:55.429
WELL, THAT WAS
A DISASTER.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.398
YOUR MOTHER HATES ME
MORE THAN EVER NOW.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.027
MY MOTHER DOES
NOT HATE YOU--

25:59.030 --> 26:00.122
OH, C'MON, NATE.

26:00.130 --> 26:01.950
WELL, WHO CARES
IF SHE DOES ?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.552
I'M JUST GLAD
IT'S OVER.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.949
ONTO THE NEXT.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.393
WE'VE A WHOLE LIFETIME
OF TENSE AND UNCOMFORTABLE

26:09.400 --> 26:11.823
FAMILY GATHERINGS
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.253
( phone ringing )

26:29.030 --> 26:30.224
HELLO ?

26:30.230 --> 26:32.391
( Ben )
Hey, where've you been ?

26:32.400 --> 26:33.492
HEY.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.060
WE HAD KIND
OF A FAMILY DINNER.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.290
MY BROTHER'S
GETTING MARRIED

26:38.300 --> 26:39.756
ARE YOU DRUNK ?

26:39.760 --> 26:44.254
Yes, my mother's boyfriend
kept pouring vodka.

26:44.260 --> 26:46.990
I'm gonna have such
a fucking headache tomorrow.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.457
YOUR MOM'S BOYFRIEND
WAS THERE ?

26:49.460 --> 26:51.291
So, how come you
didn't invite me ?

26:51.300 --> 26:54.758
BECAUSE I KNEW IT
WOULD BE EXCRUCIATING,

26:54.760 --> 26:56.853
AND I WANTED
TO SPARE YOU ?

26:56.860 --> 26:59.693
I WISH YOU WERE HERE...

26:59.700 --> 27:02.191
OR ME THERE.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.952
Why ?

27:03.960 --> 27:08.897
SO, WE COULD HAVE HOT SEX
AND THEN FALL ASLEEP TOGETHER.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.357
You could always
come over here.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.193
I'M TOO DRUNK,
I SHOULDN'T DRIVE.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.327
Or I could
come over there.

27:16.330 --> 27:19.197
I'M TOO DRUNK,
I SHOULDN'T DRIVE.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.088
( laughing )

27:21.100 --> 27:22.692
TAKE SOME ASPIRIN
BEFORE YOU GO TO BED

27:22.700 --> 27:25.589
AND VITAMIN C,
DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.854
I'LL TALK
TO YOU TOMORROW.

27:28.860 --> 27:31.192
Okay, bye.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.353
HEY, MOM.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.419
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.595
YOU READY ?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.252
YOU SHOULD'VE USED
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S RING.

27:51.260 --> 27:54.855
GOD KNOWS YOUR BROTHER
ISN'T GOING TO USE IT,

27:54.860 --> 27:57.590
AND WHO KNOWS IF CLAIRE
WILL EVER SETTLE DOWN.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.625
THAT RING WAS FOR YOU !

27:59.630 --> 28:01.257
I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT IT--

28:01.260 --> 28:02.454
YOU ARE THE FIRST BORN

28:02.460 --> 28:05.258
AND PROBABLY THE ONLY
OPPORTUNITY FOR GRANDCHILDREN

28:05.260 --> 28:06.693
THAT I WILL
EVER LIVE TO SEE.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.895
MOM, YOU NEVER
EVEN TOLD ME ABOUT IT !

28:14.400 --> 28:16.618
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT IS,

28:16.630 --> 28:18.552
YOU DON'T LIKE BRENDA.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.152
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.799
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.791
IS SHE PREGNANT ?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.428
NO, SHE'S NOT.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.458
BUT SHE IS THE WOMAN
I LOVE, MOM.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.792
YOU MAY NOT THINK SHE IS
THE BEST PERSON FOR ME,

28:32.800 --> 28:35.291
BUT I DO AND I NEED YOU
TO ACCEPT THAT.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.649
WE'RE GLAD YOU CAME BACK
TO FISHER AND SONS.

28:50.660 --> 28:53.652
YOU GAVE ME THE BEST PRICE,
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.

28:53.660 --> 28:56.197
THAT OTHER PLACE WANTED ME
TO SIGN SOME WAIVER

28:56.200 --> 28:58.794
BEFORE I COULD
SEE THE BODY.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.223
DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO THAT AS WELL ?

29:01.230 --> 29:02.822
MRS. COLLINS,
I REALLY DON'T THINK

29:02.830 --> 29:04.297
YOU WANT TO PUT YOURSELF
THROUGH THAT.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.598
YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY
EXPERIENCED SEVERE TRAUMA

29:06.600 --> 29:08.454
IT'S BEYOND RESTORATION.

29:08.460 --> 29:09.996
RESTORATION ?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.297
NO, I DON'T
WANT HIM RESTORED.

29:11.300 --> 29:14.326
WHAT'S THE POINT ?

29:17.230 --> 29:19.289
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
CHOOSE A CASKET.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.295
YOU THINK IT'S A DAY
LIKE ANY OTHER,

29:23.300 --> 29:27.157
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T REALIZE
IS THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN,

29:27.160 --> 29:30.027
AND THEN IT DOES.

29:30.030 --> 29:32.590
IT HAPPENS.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.160
AND THERE'S
SO MUCH LEFT...

29:35.160 --> 29:37.219
UNSAID.

29:37.230 --> 29:41.098
AND IT WAS ALL
JUST WASTED TIME.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.892
I JUST WANT SOMEBODY
TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

29:47.900 --> 29:51.028
JUST TO HELP.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.393
CAN YOU HELP ME ?

29:57.400 --> 30:01.791
THE FIRST LINE OF C.S. LEWIS'S
"A GRIEF OBSERVED" IS,

30:01.800 --> 30:06.055
"NO ONE EVER TOLD ME
GRIEF FELT SO LIKE FEAR."

30:06.060 --> 30:09.052
I'LL GET YOU A COPY,
I THINK IT'LL HELP.

30:09.060 --> 30:12.223
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.221
NO, IT'S NOT.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.391
NATE.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.753
NATE ?

30:23.760 --> 30:26.399
WHAT'S WRONG ?

30:28.200 --> 30:29.895
DOESN'T IT EVER
GET YOU DOWN ?

30:29.900 --> 30:32.425
SURE, ALL THE TIME.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.422
I KEEP THINKING
IT'S GONNA GET EASIER,

30:35.430 --> 30:36.852
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T.

30:36.860 --> 30:39.658
NO, IT DOESN'T.

30:40.830 --> 30:43.321
IT JUST GETS
MORE FAMILIAR.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.796
( door opening )

30:47.800 --> 30:50.849
HELLO, ANYBODY HOME ?

30:53.230 --> 30:54.925
HELLO ?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.356
WOW, DON'T YOU TWO
LOOK SHARP,

31:00.360 --> 31:01.952
JUST AS SHARP AS A COUPLE
OF LITTLE TACKS.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.791
MS. HUNTLEY.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.597
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU ?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.818
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
YOU CAN CALL ME MITZI,

31:07.830 --> 31:09.695
STOP BEING
SO GODDAMNED FORMAL !

31:09.700 --> 31:11.656
NOW, HOW COME Y'ALL
HAVE NOT THANKED ME

31:11.660 --> 31:13.651
FOR THIS SNAZZY
CASKET WALL ?

31:13.660 --> 31:16.356
OR MAYBE I SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR SELLING OUR BEAUTIFUL

31:16.360 --> 31:19.193
AND HIGHLY
PROFITABLE CASKETS.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.589
SEEING AS YOU'VE BOUGHT UP,
ABSORBED AND SHUT DOWN

31:21.600 --> 31:22.726
EVERY OTHER COMPETITOR.

31:22.730 --> 31:24.823
WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU WANT ?

31:24.830 --> 31:28.459
WHAT THE FUCK
DO I WANT ?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.497
I WANT YOU BOYS
TO COME THE FUCK WITH ME

31:32.500 --> 31:33.728
ON LITTLE FUCKING TRIP

31:33.730 --> 31:35.493
WHAT DO YOU
FUCKING SAY, HUH ?

31:35.500 --> 31:36.990
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF A FUCKING TRIP ?

31:37.000 --> 31:38.456
WELL, SEE, NOW,
THAT'S A SECRET.

31:38.460 --> 31:39.688
WE'RE VERY BUSY.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.190
WELL, I SUGGEST
YOU GET UN-BUSY.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.191
I UNDERSTAND
FISHER AND SONS

31:43.200 --> 31:44.553
NEGLECT ED TO PLACE
THEIR LICENSE NUMBER

31:44.560 --> 31:46.699
ON A RECENTLY PRINTED
ADVERTISEMENT.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.349
WE'VE ALREADY
BEEN FINED FOR THAT,

31:48.360 --> 31:50.191
SO, YOU CAN JUST
TURN AROUND AND--

31:50.200 --> 31:51.758
NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE BILLBOARD.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.398
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE TWO-COLUMN-INCHER

31:53.400 --> 31:55.254
IN THE FUNERAL PAGES
OF "THE LA. TIMES".

31:55.260 --> 31:57.524
IT'S RUN, UH-OH,
THREE WEEKS IN A ROW NOW.

31:57.530 --> 32:00.397
SO, THAT IS THREE FINES THAT
YOU CAN AVOID IF YOU JUST...

32:00.400 --> 32:04.325
DROP THE ATTITUDE
AND COME WITH ME.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.124
FEDERICO, HI,
IT'S DAVID.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.553
NATE AND I ARE TIED UP
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY,

32:14.560 --> 32:16.027
SO, WE NEED YOU TO PICK UP
THE COLLINS BODY

32:16.030 --> 32:18.055
FROM THE UNGER MORTUARY.

32:19.060 --> 32:21.153
FEDERICO, I JUST
NEED YOU TO DO THIS.

32:23.000 --> 32:23.989
COLLINS...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.729
OOH, YOU BAD BOY.

32:25.730 --> 32:29.120
THAT WASN'T VERY NICE OF YOU,
STEALING A FUNERAL FROM US.

32:29.130 --> 32:30.597
WHICH YOU STOLE
FROM US FIRST.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.158
OH, PLEASE.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.151
THIS WHOLE SELF-RIGHTEOUS
CHIP-ON-THE-SHOULDER THING

32:34.160 --> 32:36.492
IT KINDA WORKED FOR
RUSSELL CROWE IN "GLADIATOR",

32:36.500 --> 32:39.128
BUT HONEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS
TO BACK IT UP.

32:39.130 --> 32:40.825
YOU GET A BIG KICK OUT
OF YOURSELF, DON'T YOU ?

32:40.830 --> 32:42.821
AND YOU'RE A BIG STICK
IN THE MUD, AREN'T YOU ?

32:42.830 --> 32:44.457
LIGHTEN UP.

32:44.460 --> 32:47.588
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF
THIS TRIP IS TO HAVE FUN.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.352
JUST ASK BOBO.

32:49.360 --> 32:53.319
I SAID, NOW, WHAT'S MITZI DOING
HIDING ALL THE WAY IN BACK ?

32:53.330 --> 32:55.389
HI, DARLING,
YOU KNOW THE FISHERS.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.924
BOBO.

32:56.930 --> 32:58.659
GOOD TO SEE
YOU GUYS AGAIN !

32:58.660 --> 33:01.857
WELL, I NEED TO MINGLE, I'M NOT
BEING A VERY GOOD HOSTESS.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.618
SHE'S QUITE A LITTLE SPITFIRE,
ISN'T SHE ?

33:05.630 --> 33:08.656
SO, WHEN DID YOU
ALL BECOME MEMBERS ?

33:08.660 --> 33:10.321
MEMBERS ?

33:10.330 --> 33:12.992
NOTHING BEATS FLYING OUT
TO PALM SPRINGS TWICE A MONTH

33:13.000 --> 33:14.422
FOR A LITTLE GOLF.

33:14.430 --> 33:16.694
YOU KNOW, I MET
MERV GRIFFIN LAST TIME ?

33:16.700 --> 33:18.292
HELLUVA GUY.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.858
WE'RE NEVER
SELLING TO KROEHNER.

33:19.860 --> 33:22.522
OH, WELL,
THEN YOU'RE IDIOTS.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.395
NO OFFENSE.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.796
IT MUST'VE BEEN FUN
HAVING A SISTER GROWING UP.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.018
FUN IS NOT THE WORD
I WOULD CHOOSE.

34:28.030 --> 34:30.123
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I NEVER EVEN MET HER BEFORE--

34:30.130 --> 34:32.325
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

34:32.330 --> 34:35.356
SARAH HAS NO BOUNDARIES AND
SHE'S COMPLETELY SELF-INVOLVED,

34:35.360 --> 34:37.794
SHE WOULD HAVE
ONLY DISAPPOINTED YOU.

34:39.930 --> 34:41.795
WHATEVER.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.956
CLAIRE.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.396
YOU KNOW THAT I THINK
IF YOU WORK HARD,

34:48.400 --> 34:51.358
YOU CAN BE GOOD AT WHATEVER
YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.454
YEAH, SURE, MOM.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.619
HOW LONG IS MY HOUSE
GONNA BE LIKE THIS ?

35:05.630 --> 35:07.928
THIS IS A BIG JOB,
YOU GOTTA BE PATIENT.

35:07.930 --> 35:09.420
PATIENT.

35:09.430 --> 35:11.625
WHERE WAS PATIENT WHEN YOU TOLD
US TO BUY A HOUSE FULL OF MOLD ?

35:11.630 --> 35:14.121
I'M NOT A LICENSED HOUSE
INSPECTOR, YOU KNEW THAT.

35:14.130 --> 35:15.757
BESIDES YOU SHOULD
CALL THAT REALTOR

35:15.760 --> 35:17.523
AND SUE HER ASS
FOR NON-DISCLOSURE.

35:17.530 --> 35:18.690
OH, SHIT !

35:18.700 --> 35:20.292
I GOTTA HEAD DOWN
TO LONG BEACH BEFORE RUSH HOUR.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.198
NO, NO, NO !

35:21.200 --> 35:22.656
C'MON, BABY.

35:22.660 --> 35:24.321
YOU GOTTA STAY HERE,
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.651
I GOTTA PICK UP A BODY, OKAY,
THAT'S WHAT PAYS THE MORTGAGE.

35:26.660 --> 35:28.799
WELL, LET DAVID GO DO IT,
WHAT ARE YOU, HIS LAPDOG ?

35:28.800 --> 35:29.926
SHUT UP !

35:29.930 --> 35:31.625
OKAY, JUST SHUT UP,
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ONCE ?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.052
WHOA, RICO,
CALM DOWN, MAN.

35:33.060 --> 35:35.494
SHE'S JUST STRESSED
WITH THE MESS AND THE TWO KIDS

35:35.500 --> 35:36.694
WHO WOULDN'T BE ?

35:36.700 --> 35:37.655
CUT HER SOME SLACK,
PRIMO.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.150
THANK YOU.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.299
I'M OUT OF HERE.

35:43.860 --> 35:45.452
HE CAN BE A REAL PAIN.

35:45.460 --> 35:48.725
YEAH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TELL ME THAT.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.095
DON'T YOU WORRY, V.

35:50.100 --> 35:52.250
WE'LL GET THIS FIXED JUST
AS SOON AS WE CAN, OKAY ?

35:59.060 --> 36:02.393
THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN '59
FOR FRANK SINATRA.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.358
IF THESE WALLS
COULD TALK, HUH ?

36:05.360 --> 36:06.918
OOH, I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO KNOW

36:06.930 --> 36:08.750
WHAT HAPPENED ON
THAT COFFEE TABLE.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.057
C'MON.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.698
SEE WHAT YOU BOYS
ARE MISSING

36:11.700 --> 36:13.190
THIS IS THE LIFE !

36:13.200 --> 36:14.599
OH, DON'T HURT
YOURSELF, BOBO.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.249
LISTEN, WOULD YOU
BE A DEAR, DARLING,

36:16.260 --> 36:18.592
AND FIX US UP ANOTHER BATCH
OF FROZEN MARGARITAS ?

36:18.600 --> 36:19.919
THANK YOU, LOVELY.

36:19.930 --> 36:21.522
SHE'S SINGLE.

36:21.530 --> 36:23.088
I'M ENGAGED.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.125
YEAH, WELL,
I'M MARRIED.

36:25.130 --> 36:27.553
THERE ARE SWIM SUITS
AND TOWELS AND SUCH

36:27.560 --> 36:29.152
IN THE CABANA
OUT BY THE POOL.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.594
OOH !

36:31.600 --> 36:35.149
PEPPER USED TO BE CAPTAIN
OF THE U.S.C. SWIM TEAM.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.924
NOW, HE'S TRYING
TO MAKE IT AS AN ACTOR.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.057
OOF, GOD, THEY'RE A DIME
A DOZEN, AREN'T THEY ?

36:40.060 --> 36:41.049
WHY ARE WE HERE ?

36:41.060 --> 36:42.391
TO HAVE FUN.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.288
MY GOD, BOY !

36:44.300 --> 36:46.291
I DON'T EVEN THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.551
LISTEN TO ME.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.653
I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY

36:49.660 --> 36:52.493
HOW EXHAUSTING AND DEPRESSING
RUNNING A SMALL BUSINESS

36:52.500 --> 36:53.853
LIKE YOURS CAN BE.

36:53.860 --> 36:56.954
YOUR ONLY JOB TODAY
IS TO FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.123
ENJOY !

37:02.660 --> 37:03.854
WELL...

37:03.860 --> 37:06.727
WE SHOULD AT LEAST TRY
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.820
( knocking )

37:37.460 --> 37:39.052
WHAT'S UP ?

37:39.060 --> 37:41.358
I WAS JUST LEAVING YOU
SOME LAUNDRY.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.225
THAN KS.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.028
YOU GOT ROOM FOR ME
IN THERE FOR ME, BOYS ?

37:59.030 --> 38:03.126
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, MATT GILARDI
NEVER GOT TO COME HERE.

38:03.130 --> 38:05.655
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE US FEEL BETTER

38:05.660 --> 38:07.093
ABOUT HOW
HE HARASSED US ?

38:07.100 --> 38:09.056
AND HOW YOU'RE CONTINUING
TO HARASS US ?

38:09.060 --> 38:10.425
OH, PLEASE.

38:10.430 --> 38:13.024
YOU BOYS HAVE GOT TO GET
OVER THIS VICTIM MENTALITY.

38:13.030 --> 38:14.998
PEPPER !

38:17.860 --> 38:21.250
AH, FINALLY,
THE SALES PITCH.

38:24.060 --> 38:27.029
THAT'S CONSIDERABLY MORE MONEY
THAN WE'VE EVER OFFERED YOU.

38:27.030 --> 38:29.794
YOU KNOW THIS WAS
OUR FATHER'S BUSINESS,

38:29.800 --> 38:32.951
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
WE CAN JUST WALK AWAY FROM.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.929
DAVID, NOBODY'S
ASKING YOU TO LEAVE.

38:35.930 --> 38:38.558
WE LIKE THINGS
JUST THE WAY THEY ARE.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.495
WE LIKE OUR LIVES
JUST THE WAY THEY ARE.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.059
HONEY, IT MAY BE TOMORROW
OR IT MAY BE 10 YEARS FROM NOW,

38:53.060 --> 38:55.494
BUT Y'ALL ARE GOING UNDER,
IT IS JUST EVOLUTION.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.492
KROEHNER'S GOT THE SIZE,
THE RESOURCES, THE MARKET SHARE,

38:58.500 --> 39:00.456
THE LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON,
WHAT'VE Y'ALL GOT ?

39:00.460 --> 39:02.553
YOUR PRIDE, WOO HOO.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.556
THE CAR'S LEAVING FOR
THE AIRPORT IN FIVE MINUTES,

39:05.560 --> 39:07.027
Y'ALL BETTER HURRY.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.325
SHOULD WE HAVE
TAKEN THAT OFFER ?

39:25.330 --> 39:27.491
WHAT ?

39:27.500 --> 39:29.058
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS ?

39:29.060 --> 39:31.324
FIGHTING SO HARD ?

39:31.330 --> 39:33.025
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT,
MAYBE THIS IS A LOSING BATTLE.

39:33.030 --> 39:35.419
DON'T TELL ME YOU GOT
SEDUCED BY A HOT TUB.

39:35.430 --> 39:38.695
SO, SHE DANGLED
A BIG FAT CHECK IN FRONT OF US.

39:38.700 --> 39:39.997
SO, THE FUCK WHAT ?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.058
NATE--

39:41.060 --> 39:42.698
WE CAN'T GIVE UP, DAVID,
ALRIGHT, WE CAN'T,

39:42.700 --> 39:44.224
WE JUST CAN'T !

39:51.260 --> 39:52.750
YOUR MEDICATION ?

39:57.600 --> 39:59.591
HAVE YOU TOLD
BRENDA YET ?

39:59.600 --> 40:03.252
YEAH, LIKE A WEEK AGO.

40:03.260 --> 40:05.421
HOW'D SHE TAKE IT ?

40:05.430 --> 40:06.749
YOU KNOW BRENDA,

40:06.760 --> 40:10.196
SHE PRETENDS TO BE STRONGER
THAN ALL OF US.

40:28.700 --> 40:30.019
HEY, YOU.

40:35.230 --> 40:37.755
I DIDN'T THINK YOU
WERE COMING.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.558
YOU KNOW ME,

40:40.560 --> 40:42.289
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITHOUT YOU.

40:45.500 --> 40:49.254
YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
IN MY LIFE THAT WORKS.

40:51.330 --> 40:53.127
( doorbell )

40:53.130 --> 40:55.428
OH, SHIT !

40:55.430 --> 40:58.251
MY CLIENT.

41:00.630 --> 41:03.098
NATE, I GOTTA GET THIS.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.125
( laughing )

41:08.900 --> 41:11.619
OH, GOD,
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

41:11.630 --> 41:14.155
I JUST LOVE YOU.

41:15.830 --> 41:18.094
( screaming )

41:28.300 --> 41:30.655
( knocking )

41:34.900 --> 41:36.492
I ENJOYED
THE SERMON.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.252
SO, DO YOU HAVE
TO WORK TODAY ?

41:38.260 --> 41:39.557
UM, NOT REALLY.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.788
GOOD.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.360
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO PREPARE
FOR A HEARING TOMORROW.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.554
I'M THINKING ABOUT
BLOWING THAT OFF.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.959
THE GUY'S LIKE,
TOTALLY GUILTY

41:45.960 --> 41:47.951
AND I'D RATHER
SPEND THE DAY WITH YOU.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.053
DAVID !

41:54.430 --> 41:55.658
HEY.

41:55.660 --> 41:56.991
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.194
THAT'S A BIG ASS LIE.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.599
I SAW YOU
STARING IN CHURCH.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.953
WHO'S THIS ?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.450
THIS IS TAYLOR.

42:02.460 --> 42:04.052
TAYLOR, THIS IS
MY FRIEND, BEN.

42:04.060 --> 42:06.119
HI.
HEY.

42:06.130 --> 42:08.325
SO, HOW ARE YOU ?

42:08.330 --> 42:10.628
DO YOU WANT
TO GO OVER AND SAY HI ?

42:10.630 --> 42:13.258
NAH, WE'LL BE LATE
FOR THE MOVIE.

42:13.260 --> 42:14.921
YOU GUYS NOT
TALKING NOW ?

42:14.930 --> 42:18.229
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT,
IT'S NOTHING.

42:19.800 --> 42:20.721
TAYLOR !

42:20.730 --> 42:23.722
C'MON,
WE GOTTA GO.

42:23.730 --> 42:24.924
I MISS YOU.

42:24.930 --> 42:27.296

42:30.030 --> 42:32.294
BYE.
BYE.

42:34.230 --> 42:35.219
WHO'S SHE ?

42:35.230 --> 42:38.222
HER UNCLE'S AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.890
ROLL ONTO YOUR BACK,
NICE AND SLOW.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.897
SORRY, HAPPENS TO ME
ALL THE TIME.

42:47.900 --> 42:50.357
IT'S NOTHING
I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.692
SO, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.656
WHO SAID
I'M EMBARRASSED ?

43:00.130 --> 43:01.893
OKAY.

43:11.830 --> 43:13.491
EASY.

43:19.830 --> 43:21.650
YEAH...

43:21.660 --> 43:23.321
FEELS GOOD.

43:23.330 --> 43:24.558

43:24.560 --> 43:27.120
YEAH.
YEAH ?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.422
OH!

43:29.430 --> 43:31.751
HARDER.

43:34.430 --> 43:36.091
OH, GOD.

43:36.100 --> 43:37.089
YEAH.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.294
YEAH ?

43:38.300 --> 43:39.995
YEAH, YEAH, FASTER.

43:41.130 --> 43:42.722
YEAH.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.496
C'MON.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.695
AH, AHHH !

43:48.430 --> 43:51.251
( moaning )

44:05.900 --> 44:07.891
SO, THANKS.

44:07.900 --> 44:10.858
CAN I MAKE ANOTHER
APPOINTMENT FOR NEXT WEEK ?

44:10.860 --> 44:14.751
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.489
OH...

44:16.500 --> 44:17.899
OKAY.

44:17.900 --> 44:20.391
I DON'T THINK
I CAN SEE YOU AGAIN.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.949
WELL...

44:23.960 --> 44:25.120
THAN KS AGAIN.

44:25.130 --> 44:27.257
TAKE CARE.

44:43.260 --> 44:44.852
I KNOW YOUR BROTHER
DOESN'T WANT ME TO,

44:44.860 --> 44:46.157
BUT I HAVE TO SEE HIM.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.049
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THAT

44:49.060 --> 44:50.322
BEFORE THE SERVICE.

44:50.330 --> 44:52.491
THERE'S BEEN
NO RESTORATION,

44:52.500 --> 44:55.060
AND SEEING HIM LIKE THIS COULD
MAKE IT THAT MUCH WORSE.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.119
I SPENT OVER HALF
MY LIFE WITH THAT MAN,

44:57.130 --> 44:59.598
I SLEPT WITH HIM
EVERY NIGHT FOR 20 YEARS.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.728
PLEASE,
JUST LET ME SEE HIM.

45:02.730 --> 45:06.621
I HAVE TO SEE HIM
ONCE MORE.

45:06.630 --> 45:09.690
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

45:13.930 --> 45:15.329
ALRIGHT.

45:35.660 --> 45:39.699
( laughing )

45:42.060 --> 45:46.156
LOOK AT YOU NOW,
YOU FUCKING PIG !

45:46.160 --> 45:48.492
I'M GLAD YOU'RE DEAD !

45:48.500 --> 45:50.650
I'M FUCKING GLAD !

45:50.660 --> 45:54.198
AND I HOPE IT
HURT LIKE HELL !

46:02.560 --> 46:04.323
HE CAN'T
HIT ME ANYMORE,

46:04.330 --> 46:06.924
CAN HE?

46:14.030 --> 46:15.850
THANK YOU.

46:45.330 --> 46:48.151
I COULD REALLY LOVE YOU,
DAVID FISHER.

46:56.530 --> 47:00.853
NOT QUITE THE RESPONSE
I WAS HOPING FOR.

47:04.630 --> 47:06.996
BUT I CAN'T SAY
I'M ENTIRELY SURPRISED.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.251
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

47:08.260 --> 47:12.651
I'M REALLY SORRY.

47:12.660 --> 47:16.448
I LIKE YOU A LOT,
BEN--

47:16.460 --> 47:18.394
BUT...

47:24.730 --> 47:26.527
BUT I'M IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

47:26.530 --> 47:29.021
I SEE.

47:29.030 --> 47:33.228
AND WHEN EXACTLY WERE YOU
PLANNING ON TELLING ME THIS ?

47:33.230 --> 47:36.290
IT'S NOT THAT I HAVEN'T
ENJOYED BEING WITH YOU,

47:36.300 --> 47:39.098
YOU'RE A GREAT GUY,
YOU'RE A CATCH.

47:39.100 --> 47:41.250
AND HE'S NOT EVEN
AVAILABLE, I JUST...

47:41.260 --> 47:44.627
I DON'T WANT
TO LIE TO YOU.

47:49.230 --> 47:51.721
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A GOOD IDEA FOR ME

47:51.730 --> 47:53.391
TO GET INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

47:53.400 --> 47:55.823
YOU KNOW, HEALTHY.

47:55.830 --> 47:59.049
GREAT, NEXT YOU'LL BE SAYING
YOU JUST WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

47:59.060 --> 48:00.425
BEN--

48:00.430 --> 48:01.749
WELL, NOW I KNOW WHY

48:01.760 --> 48:03.853
YOU NEVER WANTED
TO INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR FAMILY.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.456
ORGANIC HERBS AND SPICES
FROM THE FARMERS MARKET.

48:18.460 --> 48:20.052
IS CLAIRE HERE ?

48:20.060 --> 48:21.698
NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

48:21.700 --> 48:23.497
WELL, IF I WANT
TO AVOID TRAFFIC,

48:23.500 --> 48:25.559
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO MISS HER, DAMN.

48:25.560 --> 48:28.597
TELL HER THIS IS
FOR HER KNOWLEDGE CORNER.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.352
SHE'LL KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

48:30.360 --> 48:33.249
I'M SURE
SH E'LL APPRECIATE THAT.

48:33.260 --> 48:36.388
OKAY, RUTH,
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ?

48:36.400 --> 48:37.719
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

48:37.730 --> 48:40.654
YOU WALTZ IN HERE
AFTER 20 YEARS...

48:40.660 --> 48:42.252
INSULTING MY COOKING,

48:42.260 --> 48:44.319
GETTING DRUNK
WITH MY BOYFRIEND,

48:44.330 --> 48:46.252
FILLING MY DAUGHTER'S HEAD
WITH ALL KINDS OF IDEAS

48:46.260 --> 48:49.457
AND REMINDING MY SONS OF
TRAUMATIC EVENTS IN THEIR LIVES.

48:49.460 --> 48:50.996
JESUS CHRIST !

48:51.000 --> 48:54.356
THE BOY WAS GONNA LOSE
HIS VIRGINITY SOONER OR LATER.

48:54.360 --> 48:57.124
AND FIONA IS A GREAT WOMAN,
VERY COMPASSIONATE--

48:57.130 --> 48:58.495
HE WAS MOLESTED !

48:58.500 --> 49:02.391
HE WAS A HORNY 15-YEAR-OLD WHO
COULDN'T BELIEVE HIS GOOD LUCK !

49:02.400 --> 49:04.857
OF COURSE, I SHOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED THAT

49:04.860 --> 49:06.259
YOU WON'T TAKE
ANY RESPONSIBILITY,

49:06.260 --> 49:07.488
YOU NEVER HAVE !

49:07.500 --> 49:10.025
OKAY, THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

49:10.030 --> 49:12.055
WHEN MOTHER DIED,
SOMEONE HAD TO STEP UP.

49:12.060 --> 49:14.324
SOMEONE HAD
TO TAKE CARE OF NANNY.

49:14.330 --> 49:15.752
BUT YOU JUST
DID AS YOU PLEASED--

49:15.760 --> 49:17.751
YOU NEVER LET
ANYBODY HELP YOU !

49:17.760 --> 49:20.058
GOD FORBID ANYTHING
SHOULD INTERFERE

49:20.060 --> 49:22.324
WITH YOU FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF !

49:22.330 --> 49:23.752
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE

49:23.760 --> 49:25.193
TO JUSTIFY
YOUR OWN SELFISHNESS--

49:25.200 --> 49:27.156
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, RUTH ?!

49:27.160 --> 49:29.993
I WANT YOU
TO APOLOGIZE !

49:30.000 --> 49:30.796
FINE !

49:30.800 --> 49:32.449
I APOLOGIZE !

49:32.460 --> 49:34.519
DOES THAT MAKE IT
ANY BETTER ?

49:34.530 --> 49:37.693
NO, BECAUSE YOU HAD
MORE FUN THAN I DID !

49:40.300 --> 49:42.052
FUN ?

49:43.700 --> 49:47.796
THE ONLY MAN
I EVER LOVED DIED...

49:47.800 --> 49:50.598
WHEN I WAS 21.

49:52.800 --> 49:56.896
THE CHILDREN I SO DESPERATELY
WANTED WERE IMPOSSIBLE,

49:56.900 --> 50:00.529
BECAUSE MY OVARIES
ARE DRY AS STONE.

50:01.700 --> 50:03.918
AND I'M A TERRIBLE ARTIST,

50:03.930 --> 50:07.422
BUT I SURROUND MYSELF
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE TALENT

50:07.430 --> 50:09.523
THAT I WILL
NEVER REALIZE.

50:09.530 --> 50:12.920
IT'S ALL HARD, RUTH.

50:12.930 --> 50:16.923
WE JUST MADE
DIFFERENT CHOICES.

50:30.200 --> 50:34.125
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT THE OVARIES.

50:39.100 --> 50:41.022
IT'S FINE.

50:45.230 --> 50:47.050
I'M SORRY
ABOUT NATHANIEL.

50:47.060 --> 50:49.551
THANK YOU.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.528
I GOT YOUR FLOWERS...

50:51.530 --> 50:54.294
A COUPLE OF
MONTHS LATER.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.556
I WAS IN PERU.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.121
(crying )

51:07.200 --> 51:09.088
LET ME FINISH MOPPING.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.153
HEY.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.593
HEY.

51:24.430 --> 51:25.829
HOW'S THE WRITING ?

51:25.830 --> 51:28.048
GOOD, REALLY GOOD.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.722
SOMEBODY
HAD A GOOD DAY.

51:33.730 --> 51:36.358
JUST THIS WOMAN
WHO WAS...

51:36.360 --> 51:39.193
SCREAMING AT THE MANGLED BODY
OF HER DEAD HUSBAND

51:39.200 --> 51:41.589
WHO USED TO BEAT HER.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.488
CAN YOU IMAGINE
HATING SOMEONE THAT MUCH

51:49.500 --> 51:51.422
AND STAYING WITH THEM
FOR 20 YEARS ?

51:51.430 --> 51:53.853
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
PEOPLE STAY TOGETHER

51:53.860 --> 51:55.999
BECAUSE IT
MAKES THEM HAPPY ?

52:00.330 --> 52:01.649
PROMISE ME,

52:01.660 --> 52:03.890
IF THINGS EVER
START TO GO NUTSO,

52:03.900 --> 52:05.527
OR YOU EVER HATE ME,
THAT WE'LL DEAL WITH IT,

52:05.530 --> 52:07.395
WE WON'T
JUST COVER IT UP ?

52:07.400 --> 52:11.427
DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE LONG GONE
BEFORE YOU COULD HATE ME.

52:11.430 --> 52:14.820
I DON'T THINK
I COULD EVER HATE YOU.

52:14.830 --> 52:18.197
BESIDES, WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

52:18.200 --> 52:21.021
ABSOLUTELY.

52:24.530 --> 52:26.418
SO, WHAT DID
YOU DO TODAY ?

52:26.430 --> 52:31.129
NOT MUCH,
A CLIENT.

52:34.130 --> 52:35.791
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING ?

52:35.800 --> 52:38.496
RELEASING YOUR COCK FROM
THE PRISON OF YOUR PANTS.

52:38.500 --> 52:40.252
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WISE ?

52:40.260 --> 52:41.955
DO YOU WANT ME
TO STOP ?

52:51.860 --> 52:53.396
( knocking )

52:54.400 --> 52:55.958
IT'S JUST ME.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.496
ARE YOU BUSY ?

52:57.500 --> 53:01.527
UH, I WAS JUST CHATTING WITH
THIS FRIEND OF MINE ONLINE.

53:01.530 --> 53:04.556
I FOUND SOME THINGS
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.425
WHAT THINGS ?

53:06.430 --> 53:08.728
JUST SOME THINGS
I'VE COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS.

53:14.430 --> 53:16.227
THESE ALL MINE ?

53:16.230 --> 53:17.424
YES.

53:19.230 --> 53:21.050
NO WAY.

53:23.660 --> 53:27.448
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S BLUE PAJAMA MAN !

53:27.460 --> 53:29.621
I TOTALLY
FORGOT ABOUT HIM.

53:29.630 --> 53:32.394
I KEPT EVERYTHING
YOU EVER DID.

53:34.630 --> 53:36.928
MOM.

53:48.160 --> 53:49.627
WHERE'S NATE ?

53:49.630 --> 53:52.292
OH, HE HAD LEFT
HOME ALREADY.

53:53.560 --> 53:54.993
WHAT ABOUT DAD ?

53:55.000 --> 53:57.889
HE WAS PROBABLY WORKING.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.989
MY GOD.
