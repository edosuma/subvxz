(female narrator)
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:04.230 --> 00:05.492
We know who it is.
We have a name.

00:05.530 --> 00:06.633
It's Andrew, babe.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.297
Hey, there's another
girl down here.

00:08.340 --> 00:09.637
I'm Sara Harvey.

00:09.670 --> 00:11.228
So when do we tell the police
about Charles?

00:11.270 --> 00:12.737
- We don't.
- We don't?

00:12.780 --> 00:15.101
They'll know Andrew is
Charles when they find him.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.505
[grunting]

00:16.550 --> 00:18.074
What happened to you?

00:18.110 --> 00:20.476
(Hanna)
He just played games with us.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.579
Who do you love more,
me or her?

00:22.620 --> 00:24.212
Who deserves water today?

00:24.250 --> 00:26.411
We all want the person
who did that to you punished.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.212
It was Andrew.
It has to be Andrew.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.785
They're supposed to give me
an anti-anxiety medication.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.128
- I asked them not to.
- I need that prescription.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.390
(Veronica)
No, you want it.
There's a difference.

00:35.430 --> 00:37.318
- That guy they caught..
- Andrew.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.564
Are you sure it's him?

00:38.600 --> 00:40.534
Do we have a Charle_s DiLaurentis
In our family?

00:40.570 --> 00:42.834
No Charles DiLaurentis
in this family.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.064
Your father's a liar.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.231
(Spencer)
'Did she say anything more?‘

00:47.280 --> 00:49.441
(Emily over phone)
'Just that, when she
saw Andrew on the news'

00:49.480 --> 00:52.449
'she didn't think he was the
one who kept her down there.‘

00:52.480 --> 00:53.811
Okay, well, details, Emily?

00:53.850 --> 00:56.785
Did she give you any details?
Why is she sure?

00:56.820 --> 01:00.153
(Emily over phone)
'She's not sure-sure,
just pretty sure.'

01:00.190 --> 01:02.829
Was it the way that he walked,
or the sound of his breathing?

01:02.860 --> 01:05.681
- She didn't say.
- 'Where is she now?‘

01:05.730 --> 01:09.427
Takin' a shower.
She takes a lot of showers.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.199
Yeah, I know the feeling.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.691
Spencer, Sara was trapped
for over two years.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.368
Andrew was in school
with us the whole time.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.605
Yeah, well, Mona was stalking
the halls when she was A.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.244
It didn't exactly
cramp her style.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.874
Mona didn't_have someone
caged up like an animal.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.117
Yeah, I know.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.141
You can't exactly
ask for a hall pass

01:30.290 --> 01:32.781
Look, I know, I may have
screwed up with the police

01:32.820 --> 01:35.482
but I still think that
Andrew is Charles.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.124
I'm just telling
you what she said.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.697
- Spencer thinks--
- It has to be Andrew.

01:39.730 --> 01:41.823
Because if it's not, we're
right back where we started

01:41.860 --> 01:44.328
and 1-1 am not
going back there.

01:44.370 --> 01:47.589
- Are you going to school?
- Hell yes, I'm going to school.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.608
Do you think
Mona will be there?

01:49.640 --> 01:52.200
Mona's mom took
her out of town.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.128
I think they're in Saratoga.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.444
- 'What about Sara?‘
- What about her?

01:56.480 --> 01:58.277
What she told
Emily about Andrew.

01:58.310 --> 02:00.870
He was everywhere, Aria.
You said it yourself.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.741
'He managed to be around
the corner from so much.'

02:03.790 --> 02:06.486
No, 1-1 know
I've been sayin' it's him..

02:06.520 --> 02:08.613
I'll just see you at school.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.820
- I guess so.
- No.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.282
No guessing,
you have to be there.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.548
I not walking in there alone.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.818
- 'Bye.‘
- Okay, bye.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.532
[dramatic music]

02:28.810 --> 02:31.472
* Got a secret
can you keep It? *

02:31.510 --> 02:33.774
* Swear this one you'll save

02:33.820 --> 02:36.618
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:36.650 --> 02:38.914
* Takin' this one to the grave

02:38.950 --> 02:41.589
* If I show you
that I know you *

02:41.620 --> 02:43.952
* Won't tell what I said

02:43.990 --> 02:46.527
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

02:46.560 --> 02:49.529
* If one of them is dead *

02:51.570 --> 02:54.664
So you're going
back to school already.

02:55.770 --> 02:58.568
Yeah, there is
not that much left.

03:00.940 --> 03:03.943
My mom said she could
give you a ride home.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.174
Okay.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.582
Are you okay?

03:15.560 --> 03:17.858
I was wonderin' if I could

03:17.890 --> 03:19.790
hang around here for awhile.

03:19.830 --> 03:23.288
'Till you got home
from school.‘

03:23.330 --> 03:24.763
Okay.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.893
Yeah, I'll just tell my mom.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.237
Thanks.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.741
Why don't you hold onto this?

03:36.780 --> 03:38.748
In case you wanna
talk to someone.

03:38.780 --> 03:41.248
- I can't take your phone.
- No, it's not mine.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.681
I-it's a burner.
My friend gets them for me.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.349
I'll just put my number
on speed-dial.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.255
You can text me if you want to.

03:56.030 --> 03:59.329
I guess I'll have
to go back...to school.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.264
The only way people
know me is from the news.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.676
I saw a story.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.905
They described me as feral.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.240
Did you think I looked feral?

04:15.480 --> 04:18.415
Not feral, um..

04:18.450 --> 04:21.010
...more like a lost puppy.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.789
You just needed
some grooming.

04:25.630 --> 04:28.656
Um...I'm sorry.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.894
I-I shouldn't have come here.

04:29.930 --> 04:33.263
I...I should've just
toughed it out at home.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.436
Is your mom angry
that I came here?

04:36.470 --> 04:37.869
I-I don't want to make
your mom angry.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.334
No-no-no, no.
No one is angry at you.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.313
I'll tell you what..

04:47.680 --> 04:51.639
...why don't the three of us
have breakfast together?

04:51.690 --> 04:53.385
I thought you were
going to school.

04:53.420 --> 04:56.423
H can go tomorrow.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.826
We have French toast
to make this morning.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.935
[mellow music]

05:06.970 --> 05:09.063
[sighs]

05:09.100 --> 05:11.762
- What's that for?
- Comfort food.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.402
Oh, you're a very

05:13.440 --> 05:14.600
attentive host.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.107
No, I don't do
this for every customer.

05:16.140 --> 05:19.348
Just the ones that order
coffee to go and then don't go.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.644
Yeah, I-I just thought
that I'd sit here for a minute

05:21.680 --> 05:23.409
before I walk to school.

05:23.450 --> 05:26.556
You and the others
are going back today?

05:26.590 --> 05:28.581
Yes.

05:28.620 --> 05:32.078
Are you ready for that?

05:32.130 --> 05:33.825
No.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.725
Then don't go.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.398
Play hoolq.
You're entitled to.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.898
I don't wanna hide
in my house all day.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.669
You can stay here.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.735
You can use
the desk in the back.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.761
- You can_ write.
- No writing.

05:44.810 --> 05:45.902
You can not write.

05:45.940 --> 05:49.034
You can read, doodle

05:49.080 --> 05:53.779
'alphabetize the spice shelf,
anything.‘

05:53.820 --> 05:56.983
You're safe here.
I promise.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.887
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.451
I told you
what my father said.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.162
You have to ask him again.
You have to make him tell you.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.691
He looked at me and said
that there was no such person

06:12.740 --> 06:13.764
as Charles DiLaurentis
In our famIIy.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.165
Ali, your father
is lying to you!

06:15.200 --> 06:17.134
A didn't just pick
that name out of the air.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.569
A is for Andrew.

06:18.610 --> 06:19.872
Then why put the name

06:19.910 --> 06:21.605
Charles DiLaurentis
rIght In front of us?

06:21.640 --> 06:22.868
Hidden, but hidden just enough.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.605
Why did he
want us to find it?

06:24.650 --> 06:26.845
Look, if this person is real

06:26.880 --> 06:28.177
and my dad knows who it is

06:28.220 --> 06:30.438
he'd be down at
the police station right now.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.118
I really wish I was as sure
of that as you are.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.881
If you actually are that sure.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.386
I think you should go now.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.522
[dramatic music]

06:50.170 --> 06:52.832
- I'm going to talk to Jason.
- 'No.‘

06:52.880 --> 06:55.804
Leave him out of it.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.478
He's messed up enough
because of all this.

06:57.510 --> 07:00.638
Then he has a right to know
and maybe get un-messed.

07:00.680 --> 07:04.047
He's my brother too.
Our families are connected.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.183
They're more than just connected
they're all tangled up

07:06.220 --> 07:08.654
like necklaces in the bottom
of your jewelry box.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.749
Leave him alone.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.520
I don't want anybody
else hating me.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.621
What makes you think
he's gonna hate you?

07:17.670 --> 07:19.865
Because that's how it works.

07:25.970 --> 07:28.973
I'm under every stone
that somebody turns over.

07:30.710 --> 07:33.440
I make people into people
that they never were.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.945
It's all my fault.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.778
'I saw you and Em and Aria
and Hanna in that place'

07:41.820 --> 07:44.948
'that sick place, and I knew'

07:44.990 --> 07:47.094
I was why you were there.

07:48.030 --> 07:49.895
It always comes down to me.

07:49.930 --> 07:52.125
And everyone would
be fine without me.

07:52.170 --> 07:55.697
God, Ali, no,
it's not like that.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.833
You think it yourself.

07:57.870 --> 08:00.134
No, I don't.

08:05.050 --> 08:07.177
(automated response)
'You've reached Spencer.
Leave a..'

08:10.290 --> 08:12.212
Hanna?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.683
Dr. Sullivan.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.119
I'm so glad to see you here.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.219
I called, did your
mother tell you?

08:17.260 --> 08:19.797
Yeah, yeah, she did.
That was really nice.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.721
I gave her some names of some
people you might wanna talk to.

08:23.770 --> 08:24.896
Thanks.

08:26.030 --> 08:29.261
And you decided
to come back to school?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.733
Yeah.

08:30.770 --> 08:31.998
'Are the others here?‘

08:32.040 --> 08:33.974
Uh, not yet. Just me.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.208
Well, I'm here consulting with

08:37.250 --> 08:39.275
the school counselors
two days a week.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.074
- 'If you'd like stop by..'
- Okay.

08:43.050 --> 08:45.518
Please, stop by.

08:46.620 --> 08:47.655
Thanks.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.025
[bell ringing]

08:54.660 --> 08:56.628
[instrumental music]

09:06.710 --> 09:10.168
* When I come around
all eyes be *

09:10.210 --> 09:12.007
* Turnin' on me

09:12.050 --> 09:15.611
* Turnin' on me

09:15.650 --> 09:17.288
* Yeah yeah

09:20.760 --> 09:24.651
* When you come around
time slows down *

09:24.690 --> 09:26.180
* Feel the heart beat

09:26.230 --> 09:28.551
* I feel my heartbeat

09:29.900 --> 09:32.095
* I feel my heart beatin'

09:34.740 --> 09:38.369
* When you look at me and I feel
like I'm always on skies *

09:38.410 --> 09:41.937
* Don't fool around baby
show me your wild side *

09:41.980 --> 09:45.199
* You know it feels right

09:45.250 --> 09:48.276
* You know it feels right

09:51.120 --> 09:53.714
'Who are you?‘

09:56.660 --> 09:59.220
- How you doin'?
- Good. I'm okay.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.990
Good.
Uh, here's a tip.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.691
If you don't want
somebody knowing that

10:03.730 --> 10:06.733
you're hiding something
from them, don't hide it.

10:08.070 --> 10:10.664
Maybe I wasn't
really hiding it.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.869
Who is he?

10:17.910 --> 10:20.242
Really?

10:20.280 --> 10:23.147
I trusted him, and all I
know is what he told me.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.749
What do you wanna know?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.894
I think the thing that A..

10:37.930 --> 10:42.230
Andrew hated the most was
that we were friends.

10:43.170 --> 10:46.037
Aria, Spencer, Emily and me.

10:46.070 --> 10:49.676
Like ruining that
was the big win and..

10:49.710 --> 10:51.143
...maybe it was.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.439
How?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.277
The dark

10:56.320 --> 10:59.858
the cold,
being hungry..

10:59.890 --> 11:03.223
That was bad enough. But there
was something else going on.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.091
(woman on loudspeaker)
'Choose one.‘

11:11.200 --> 11:14.169
Hanna, how do you feel about

11:14.200 --> 11:17.909
scheduling some time together?

11:17.940 --> 11:19.305
Well, it can't just be me.

11:19.340 --> 11:21.308
I mean, it has
to be the four of us.

11:21.340 --> 11:24.707
I_can't force the others
Into a group seSSIon.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.913
Well, you're a doctor.
Can't you subpoena them?

11:27.950 --> 11:30.145
It doesn't work like that.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.785
But if you can get them
all to come to my office

11:33.820 --> 11:35.788
I'll find time for you.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.751
I'll make it happen.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.251
Hi, is-is the doctor available

11:42.300 --> 11:45.861
to talk to the Rosewood
Police Department?

11:45.900 --> 11:47.333
Oh, alright.

11:47.370 --> 11:50.806
Please hold for
Detective Mervin.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.979
It's the nurse.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.774
[clears throat]

11:55.810 --> 11:59.746
Hello, this is Detective Mervin,
is this Dr. Fenton?

11:59.780 --> 12:01.816
Oh, no, that's alright,
you could help me.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.841
Um, we have a patient
here of the doctor's

12:03.890 --> 12:06.814
one Andrew Campbell,
and we just wanted to

12:06.860 --> 12:08.316
check and _make sure
our InformatIon Is correct

12:08.360 --> 12:10.328
so that he's
properly cared for.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.420
Well, any prescription drugs
he should be taking

12:15.460 --> 12:18.793
any medical history that we
should to be aware of, um..

12:18.830 --> 12:20.263
Why don't, why don't
we start with the basics?

12:20.300 --> 12:23.303
Can you confirm his
date and place of birth

12:23.340 --> 12:26.138
and social security number?

12:29.540 --> 12:30.746
Right.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.869
No, that's alright.
Um, I understand.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.185
We will contact the parents.
Thank you so much.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.858
You didn't get
anything, did you?

12:40.890 --> 12:42.482
Can't give out medical
information over the phone.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.058
But...as for his date of birth,
and where he was born

12:46.090 --> 12:48.058
that information is sealed.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.295
Sealed? Sealed where?

12:52.070 --> 12:54.231
With the rest
of his adoption records.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.868
[dramatic music]

13:08.320 --> 13:10.948
Hey, lady.
Can we get our ball back?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.286
Nice kick.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.025
You got great control.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.322
Thank you.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.923
Are those boys
all from church?

13:25.970 --> 13:29.861
Not all. It's a church program,
but any kid can join.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.162
Where are the girls?

13:32.210 --> 13:34.337
Co-ed doesn't work
well at this age.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.372
They're starting to notice
certain distinctions.

13:37.410 --> 13:41.141
So the girls lose out?
That's not fair.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.511
Oh, we had a group for girls

13:42.550 --> 13:45.314
but, uh, they lost
their youth leader.

13:45.350 --> 13:47.910
Can't have a program
without proper supervision.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.825
That's too bad.

13:52.230 --> 13:55.199
Would you like to volunteer?

13:55.230 --> 13:57.198
For what?

13:57.230 --> 13:59.323
To run the girls'
soccer program.

13:59.370 --> 14:02.362
You've got the moves.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.504
I'm talking about your kick.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.100
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

14:07.140 --> 14:10.143
Why not?

14:10.180 --> 14:12.273
Being a leader of girls

14:12.310 --> 14:14.540
that hasn't worked
out well for me.

14:14.580 --> 14:18.038
Maybe that's somethin'
you can talk to them about.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.546
There are mothers
in this town

14:19.590 --> 14:22.354
who wouldn't appreciate me
supervising their daughters.

14:22.390 --> 14:26.952
Why don't you let
me worry about them?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.025
You don't take no
for an answer, do you?

14:29.060 --> 14:31.267
Not if it can be avoided, no.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.034
[dramatic music]

14:42.540 --> 14:44.576
Up until by the age of 12

14:44.610 --> 14:47.647
Emily's closet was done
in early hurricane.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.649
Then came the glorious day
she discovered hangers.

14:50.690 --> 14:51.645
Okay.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.448
It's true.

14:59.030 --> 15:01.692
You're probably just gonna
start all over, right?

15:01.730 --> 15:05.962
I mean, clear out your closet
and get all new things.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.059
I sort of have to.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.239
Have to?

15:10.270 --> 15:13.433
My mom gave away
all my stuff.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.436
Not right away, she..

15:15.480 --> 15:17.448
...said she waited a year.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.018
Then she packed
it up and gave it away.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.143
Well, it was probably
really hard for her

15:23.190 --> 15:25.442
to have all your
things around.

15:25.490 --> 15:28.015
She said she needed the space.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.385
Uh, you can have whatever fits.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.250
And there's more
stuff in the attic.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.052
Yeah, a lot more.

15:41.170 --> 15:42.728
You ran away from home?

15:42.770 --> 15:43.964
Mom.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.137
That's okay.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.400
Yeah, I ran away.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.301
Why?

15:51.350 --> 15:53.409
Just couldn't do it anymore.

15:53.450 --> 15:56.044
Couldn't do what?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.513
Pretend to be happy.

15:59.050 --> 16:02.656
Pretend everything
was gonna be okay.

16:02.690 --> 16:05.557
Pretend my dad
would come back, and..

16:05.590 --> 16:09.094
...he'd be different
if he did.

16:09.130 --> 16:11.325
I'm really sorry.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.769
Not your fault.

16:12.800 --> 16:17.032
I'm still sorry.
And a little bit angry.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.768
You know what? I think that you
should try this one again.

16:21.810 --> 16:23.505
It looks really nice. The color
should be good for you.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.108
[cellphone ringing]

16:25.150 --> 16:26.503
'Thanks.'

16:31.120 --> 16:32.644
Hanna, I'm sorry.

16:32.690 --> 16:35.989
'I meant to call, I just..
I couldn't make it.'

16:37.760 --> 16:39.682
Where are you?

16:44.070 --> 16:48.131
I have to..
I have to ask you a favor.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.592
Name it.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.244
I need you to
talk to Ali.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.645
Talk to All about what?

16:59.680 --> 17:02.615
About keeping away
from Lorenzo.

17:02.650 --> 17:06.040
Your partner? What does
he have to do with Alison?

17:06.090 --> 17:09.514
Nothing yet.
I wanna keep it that way.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.189
What makes you think Ali's
interested in Lorenzo?

17:13.230 --> 17:14.629
I saw them together.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.829
That's his business,
isn't it?

17:18.870 --> 17:19.723
His and Ali's.

17:19.770 --> 17:22.534
We're not talking about
just anybody here.

17:22.570 --> 17:24.435
We're talking about Alison.

17:24.470 --> 17:27.439
You know, people can change.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.708
She helped you find us.

17:28.740 --> 17:31.243
Right, 'cause she needed
you and Mona alive.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.374
She was looking out for Ali,
that's what she always does.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.217
So that's it,
she just reverts back

17:36.250 --> 17:38.138
to who she was
before all this happened?

17:38.190 --> 17:41.159
Look, I wanna
trust her, believe me.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.819
and anybody else she can use.

17:45.860 --> 17:50.422
'Lorenzo doesn't know
what she's capable of, we do.'

17:50.470 --> 17:53.735
If you can tell me
you completely trust her

17:53.770 --> 17:55.795
I'll drop this whole thing.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.578
Come on, get in the car.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.498
I can't. _
Sara's upstaIrs.

18:05.550 --> 18:08.519
Em, get in the car.
We're gonna go see Dr. Sullivan.

18:08.550 --> 18:09.778
Dr. Sullivan?

18:09.820 --> 18:11.742
Yeah, I'm declaring
an intervention.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.156
If you wanna talk to her,
that's your business.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.715
No, it's all of our business
and you know that.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.081
Well, I can't,
I have to take care of Sara.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.588
Good, you got the text.

18:26.630 --> 18:28.234
Yeah, I got it.
But listen--

18:28.270 --> 18:29.396
Now all we need
Is Spencer.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.839
No, listen,
I got it confirmed.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.235
Andrew Campbell was adopted.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.875
- Confirmed? How?
- Ezra helped me.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.549
Wait, you didn't tell him
about Charles, did you?

18:37.580 --> 18:39.172
No, of course not.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.474
You guys, look, the point is
we know for sure.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.771
Andrew was adopted,
which means he might

18:42.820 --> 18:44.310
be older than we think he is.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.739
He could be that other kid
in the home movie.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.678
Wait, so before
he was a Campbell

18:48.720 --> 18:50.529
maybe he was a DiLaurentis.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.467
You probably heard,
my dad is trying to decide

18:57.500 --> 18:59.798
how many people he
can sue at one time.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.435
It's the kinda
challenge he enjoys.

19:04.470 --> 19:07.507
I wanted to talk
to you about him.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.178
About your family.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.248
Our family.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.679
Well, I don't think
I've ever heard you

19:14.720 --> 19:17.712
refer to it as our family.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.719
Well, things change.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.729
_ 'When we were down there
In that place, we saw a name.‘

19:25.290 --> 19:28.498
We found it or Andrew
wanted us to find it.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.521
But either way,
we have a name now.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.390
And we don't know
what it means.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.795
What name?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.660
Charles DiLaurentis.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.431
We haven't gone
to the police yet.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.674
Why not?

19:42.710 --> 19:43.847
'Cause we _wanna
know what It meant

19:43.880 --> 19:45.745
before we gave it to them.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.247
And All asked your dad

19:47.280 --> 19:49.271
but he said that
there was no such person.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.811
I don't know any
Charles DiLaurentis either.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.919
Not even a cousin somewhere?

19:57.960 --> 19:59.882
Not on our side
of the family.

19:59.930 --> 20:02.990
Look, Andrew must have
done it just to mess with Ali.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.588
[cellphone beeps]

20:08.470 --> 20:11.598
Um...I have to go.

20:14.010 --> 20:15.568
See you later.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.874
Charles DiLaurentis?

20:21.550 --> 20:22.869
You do know the name.

20:24.450 --> 20:27.954
Uh, no, not really.
It's a coincidence.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.689
What is?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.379
'Charlie.‘

20:32.430 --> 20:33.499
Charlie DiLaurentis?

20:33.530 --> 20:35.953
Just Charlie.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.322
But my dad
told you the truth.

20:39.370 --> 20:41.565
About what?

20:41.600 --> 20:43.636
Charlie doesn't exist.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.268
It's nice to see
all of you agaIn.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.449
- Good to see you.
- Glad you all could make it.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.345
I told you we would.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.472
Is Spencer coming?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.340
We don't know.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.584
She'll be here.

20:59.620 --> 21:00.609
[telephone ringing]
Okay, well I've cleared

21:00.660 --> 21:02.753
some time but let me take care

21:02.790 --> 21:03.825
of this phone call first.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.384
I'll be just a minute.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.681
Thanks.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.859
So what are we supposed
to tell her?

21:13.900 --> 21:16.630
It's not about telling her

21:16.670 --> 21:18.900
it's about telling
each other.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.737
Hanna, I think
sometimes it's better

21:20.780 --> 21:22.008
not to talk about things.

21:22.040 --> 21:25.498
Really, Em?
How have you been sleeping?

21:25.550 --> 21:27.541
Guys, we shouldn't do this
without Spencer.

21:27.580 --> 21:28.672
She'll be here.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.347
Are you sure?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.752
You guys, we need to talk.

21:34.790 --> 21:35.882
That's why we're here.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.353
No, I mean we have to talk.

21:37.390 --> 21:40.052
Jason told me who
Charles DiLaurentis is.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.955
Wait, so, he knew,
but Ali didn't?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.059
- Was Alison lying?
- It wasn't Charles.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.694
At least not when Jason
knew him. It was Charlie.

21:46.730 --> 21:48.038
They were friends
when they were little.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.800
So Charlie grew up
to be Charles?

21:50.840 --> 21:53.570
Charlie was Jason's
imaginary friend.

21:53.610 --> 21:56.408
Imaginary, like Mr. Biscuit?

21:58.710 --> 22:00.940
Long story.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.813
- Wait, Jason told you this?
- Yes.

22:03.850 --> 22:06.114
And then one day,
Mr. DiLaurentis went to Jason

22:06.150 --> 22:07.913
and said that Charlie
had to go away.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.827
And then Jason _
never saw CharIIe agaIn.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.795
Wait, wait a minute,
so...if Jason's dad

22:13.830 --> 22:15.957
knew that Charlie was Jason's
imaginary friend

22:16.000 --> 22:19.094
why wouldn't he just tell Alison
that when she asked him?

22:19.130 --> 22:21.530
Yeah, why not?

22:21.570 --> 22:23.504
Wait, so those home movies

22:23.540 --> 22:25.838
those were movies
of Jason and CharIIe?

22:25.870 --> 22:28.407
There's nothing
imaginary about Charles

22:28.440 --> 22:30.101
and Ali's dad knows it.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.677
Yeah, Hanna's right, we have
to tell Sullivan everything.

22:32.710 --> 22:33.972
[cellphone ringing]

22:36.920 --> 22:38.945
It's Sara. I-I gave her
one of Caleb's phones.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.617
Okay, can you please send
that to voicemail?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.810
No, it's a face chat request.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.022
Wait.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.121
If that's Sara,
who's sending this?

22:54.870 --> 22:56.132
[all gasp]

22:56.800 --> 22:59.906
[intense music]

23:02.580 --> 23:03.842
[beeping]

23:10.520 --> 23:13.080
Yes, I will see you
at your session on Tuesday.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.758
Okay.

23:32.170 --> 23:33.501
Where is she?

23:34.610 --> 23:35.872
(Sara)
'Hello.‘

23:47.990 --> 23:49.753
Sara probably thinks
we're insane.

23:49.790 --> 23:51.485
Emily will
explain it to her.

23:51.530 --> 23:53.521
Without telling her
what was on the phone?

23:53.560 --> 23:57.052
No, it won't do her any good
to scare her with that.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.523
If A is Charles,
and Charles is Andrew

23:59.570 --> 24:03.609
and Andrew is in jail,
then who made that call?

24:03.640 --> 24:05.107
'Who was in the room with Sara?‘

24:05.140 --> 24:08.109
Did Mr. Biscuit ever make
any threatenIng phone calls?

24:08.140 --> 24:10.438
Leave Mr. Biscuit out of this.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.643
Hi, Mrs. Fields.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.079
Oh, girls.

24:17.620 --> 24:18.780
Where's Em?

24:18.820 --> 24:19.946
She's upstairs with Sara.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.515
Okay. Good.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.627
Is something wrong?

24:25.660 --> 24:27.150
This isn't official but..

24:27.190 --> 24:30.819
...I was just at the
police station visiting and..

24:30.870 --> 24:32.189
...they're gonna release
Andrew Campbell.

24:32.230 --> 24:34.733
- Release him?
- Wait, did he make bail?

24:34.770 --> 24:35.896
He doesn't have to make bail

24:35.940 --> 24:37.703
they're not charging him
with anything.

24:37.740 --> 24:39.503
Wh-what do you mean
they're not charging him?

24:39.540 --> 24:41.974
Well, I got
this secondhand, but..

24:42.010 --> 24:43.671
...there's no case.

24:43.710 --> 24:45.769
'He has an alibi for when
Mona was taken from her house.‘

24:45.810 --> 24:47.971
And he was having his appendix
removed the weekend

24:48.020 --> 24:49.578
Sara Harvey was kidnapped.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.144
So if they don't think
that he did it..

24:51.190 --> 24:53.909
Then that person is
still out there.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.758
And you girls need to
take precautions.

24:56.790 --> 24:59.122
- When was Andrew released?
- 'He hasn't been yet.'

24:59.160 --> 25:02.197
They still have to process him
and wait for his family.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.198
'He should be out
in a few hours.‘

25:05.770 --> 25:08.068
You girls need to check in
with your parents and..

25:08.100 --> 25:09.260
...let 'em know
what's happening.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.801
Yeah, we will.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.102
Okay.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.801
Why did you ask
when Andrew was released?

25:16.840 --> 25:19.149
Because, if he was out,
he could've made that call.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.944
Well, he wasn't.
So now what?

25:42.240 --> 25:44.902
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

25:44.940 --> 25:47.602
Trust me, we know exactly
how crazy it sounds.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.177
Jason never told you
anything about Charlie?

25:50.210 --> 25:51.575
No.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.942
He said your dad
knows all about it.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.072
'Your dad was the one
who told Jason'

25:55.120 --> 25:57.076
'that Charlie had to go away.‘

25:58.190 --> 26:00.112
Ali, your dad lied to you.

26:06.230 --> 26:07.322
[sighs]

26:10.930 --> 26:15.060
Jason always said that something
was missing from this family.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.807
I always thought that he was
talking about himself..

26:17.840 --> 26:20.559
'...being left out of things
like photo albums.‘

26:23.650 --> 26:26.608
But maybe he wasn't
the one that was removed.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.148
Ali, do you think
there could be proof

26:31.190 --> 26:33.078
of Charles DiLaurentis
in this house?

26:33.120 --> 26:34.781
Guys, we've been through
this house with a map.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.959
Yeah, but we weren't
looking for Charlie.

26:36.990 --> 26:40.994
You were looking for my
hiding places, not my parents.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.823
There's nothing
in here either.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.121
Come with me.

26:50.140 --> 26:51.732
Yeah, I'm sorry.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.362
It was very rude
and we're all very sorry.

26:53.410 --> 26:56.004
But we _had these
emergenCIes come up.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.271
No, I understand
if it was an emergency.

26:59.310 --> 27:02.040
But you all had emergencies?

27:02.080 --> 27:03.718
'No.'

27:03.750 --> 27:06.116
No, we all had
the same emergency.

27:06.150 --> 27:08.254
My mom slipped in the shower.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.110
'We think it was the soap.‘

27:10.160 --> 27:11.684
Is she alright?

27:11.730 --> 27:12.958
Yeah, she's fine.

27:12.990 --> 27:14.252
Tempest in a tea bag.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.429
Do you girls wanna make
another appointment?

27:17.460 --> 27:21.760
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

27:24.370 --> 27:26.736
If we don't find anything here,
we'll look in the garden.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.374
Starting with the azaleas.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.871
Really?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.740
Where do you hide
things, Spence?

27:35.780 --> 27:37.748
Under your mattress,
in that big barn of yours?

27:37.790 --> 27:41.385
[sighs]
No, I have a...loose
floorboard in my closet.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.826
- That's always good.
- 'Yeah.‘

27:49.000 --> 27:51.025
Toby is not gonna like this.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.026
Why not?

27:53.070 --> 27:56.096
He thought you were safe so he
could go back to hating me.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.108
He doesn't hate you.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.844
Have you met his new partner?

28:09.880 --> 28:11.142
Lorenzo?

28:11.990 --> 28:13.958
'No, not yet.'

28:13.990 --> 28:15.912
He's nice.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.382
Yeah, Toby likes him.

28:19.530 --> 28:22.351
Toby must have...told him
all about me.

28:23.230 --> 28:25.061
Just as well.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.398
What's that supposed to mean?

28:27.430 --> 28:29.990
Has Toby talked
to Lorenzo about me?

28:30.040 --> 28:31.359
I don't know.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.075
Where did you meet him?

28:38.110 --> 28:39.839
- Lorenzo?
-Hmm.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.780
Toby was with him.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.789
And then I
saw him again...at church.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.358
- Don't laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

28:51.390 --> 28:54.757
I'm just..
I'm a little bit surprised.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.228
It's pointless, right?

28:58.270 --> 29:01.194
Me with somebody like that.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.458
I mean, that could
never go anywhere.

29:07.570 --> 29:08.730
Could it?

29:09.480 --> 29:11.505
Where would you
want it to go?

29:17.820 --> 29:20.186
You know, Ali,
there's a version of this

29:20.220 --> 29:22.256
where we could've
all been kIlled.

29:22.290 --> 29:24.850
But we weren't.
So it's like a second chance.

29:24.890 --> 29:28.394
And I don't know anybody
who couldn't use one of those.

29:28.430 --> 29:30.489
As long as we don't waste it.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.328
[instrumental music]

30:16.580 --> 30:17.877
[sighs]

30:37.260 --> 30:39.364
[intense music]

30:43.270 --> 30:44.498
(Spencer)
'That's the same place
in the home movie.‘

30:44.540 --> 30:46.531
'The one in the dollhouse.‘

30:46.570 --> 30:49.073
So one of those boys is Jason.

30:49.110 --> 30:50.907
And the other one's Charlie.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.372
The boy who never was.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.943
You're smart, Aria.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.039
I never would have thought
to look in the button jar.

30:59.090 --> 31:02.514
Yeah, well, it's where I used to
hide my candy money from Mike.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.293
My dad's gonna be home soon.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.327
You should probably go.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.668
Maybe we shouldn't leave you
alone right now.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.237
No, it'll be okay.

31:18.270 --> 31:21.273
I'll find out what all this
means and then I'll call you.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.908
Let's go.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.455
Someone should've
stayed with her.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.378
She has to do this alone.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.523
Her dad wasn't gonna say
anything in front of us.

31:47.670 --> 31:49.297
Oh, God.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.067
I guess they processed him.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.402
Aria, maybe you shouldn't.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.541
- Andrew.
- Stay away from me.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.581
- Are your parents inside?
- They called them.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.417
I wasn't staying
in there to wait.

32:09.460 --> 32:12.122
Look, I'm really glad
you're out.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.151
Really? That's not
what I heard.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.258
You have to understand--

32:15.300 --> 32:18.189
No, you have to understand.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.458
Do you know where I was,
the three weeks

32:19.500 --> 32:21.297
'they were trying to find me?‘

32:21.340 --> 32:24.104
Looking for you.

32:24.140 --> 32:25.664
I was gonna be the hero

32:25.710 --> 32:28.975
instead I get arrested,
thrown in jail.

32:29.010 --> 32:32.275
'They investigate my parents,
tear up my uncle's farm'

32:32.310 --> 32:34.744
because I wanted to help you.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.247
Because I didn't believe
what people said

32:36.280 --> 32:38.419
about you and your friends.

32:38.450 --> 32:41.089
- Just let me explain--
- 'Don't.'

32:41.120 --> 32:42.382
Just don't.

32:43.290 --> 32:44.757
We graduate in three weeks

32:44.790 --> 32:47.054
all you have to do
is stay out of my way.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.198
You'll graduate..

32:51.230 --> 32:52.458
...that doesn't mean we will.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.695
Oh, you'll graduate.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.959
The school wants you gone
as much as the rest of us.

32:59.140 --> 33:00.562
'You'll graduate with honors.‘

33:00.610 --> 33:03.602
Andrew, you need a lift?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.074
Like I'm getting in
a car with you two.

33:06.110 --> 33:08.010
'No, thank you.‘

33:10.250 --> 33:12.548
O_ther towns
have nIce tOXIc dumps.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.412
Rosewood has you.

33:19.260 --> 33:20.727
So I guess you heard him.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.389
[sighs]
We heard.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.092
We're just gonna go check in,
then we can drive you home.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.165
Thanks.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.691
Hey. Are you Lorenzo?

33:32.840 --> 33:35.274
Yeah, I'm Lorenzo.

33:35.310 --> 33:36.732
I'm Spencer.

33:36.780 --> 33:39.442
- I figured that's who you were.
- Heh!

33:39.480 --> 33:41.277
Uh, this is Aria,
Emily and Hanna.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.412
We're Alison's friends.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.680
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.412
Come on.

34:00.430 --> 34:03.137
Andrew's not gonna
blame us forever.

34:03.170 --> 34:05.468
Why not?
It's my fault.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.398
He was set up.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.328
It wasn't just Andrew,
we all were.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.541
Hmm.
Worse than ever.

34:13.850 --> 34:15.841
but they don't believe us,
do they?

34:15.880 --> 34:19.213
Now we're more cut-off
than ever.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.512
(Spencer)
'That's what Charles
really wanted to do'

34:20.550 --> 34:23.383
'to us in that dollhouse..'

34:23.420 --> 34:25.422
...make us feel alone forever.

34:25.460 --> 34:26.722
Isolated.

34:33.230 --> 34:35.437
When I was in that place..

34:36.770 --> 34:39.830
...Charlie, Charles,
whoever it was..

34:41.510 --> 34:43.603
...he made me play a game..

34:45.350 --> 34:46.601
...with switches.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.609
About hurting people.

34:54.490 --> 34:56.549
I thought that
I was the only one.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.497
But I, I was never shocked.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.627
Were any of you ever shocked?

35:05.930 --> 35:07.227
No.

35:09.370 --> 35:12.203
He tricked us.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.708
The point was that we thought
we hurt each other.

35:16.780 --> 35:20.546
That was what Charles
really wanted us to know.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.878
That there was a point
that we would do it.

35:23.650 --> 35:25.117
Any of us.

35:26.490 --> 35:27.718
All of us.

35:37.530 --> 35:38.667
[gaSPSI

35:39.800 --> 35:41.791
It doesn't look
that bad, does it?

35:45.870 --> 35:46.859
Your mom helped.

35:46.910 --> 35:50.676
We were talkin'
and one thing lead to another.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.542
What do you think?

36:02.660 --> 36:03.957
I called you.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.389
Toby gave me a ride home

36:05.430 --> 36:06.658
in the back
of his police car, okay?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.597
Andrew Campbell's
been released.

36:10.630 --> 36:11.892
Charges dropped.

36:11.930 --> 36:13.522
I know.

36:13.570 --> 36:16.664
The police patrols will be
coming back for protection.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.463
But I-I don't want you
going anywhere

36:18.510 --> 36:20.705
without me knowing
where you are.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.570
I think I'm gonna try
to sleep on my own tonight.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.499
Apparently, when they
questioned Andrew

36:27.550 --> 36:29.939
'he said a few things about
you and the other girls.‘

36:31.520 --> 36:34.819
How you all tricked him
into helping you.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.556
I bet the police
loved that story.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.558
Is it true?

36:42.030 --> 36:43.952
It's made up of facts..

36:44.000 --> 36:46.662
...that doesn't make it true.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.434
How was it..

36:50.470 --> 36:52.267
'...going back to school?‘

36:53.610 --> 36:56.431
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?

36:56.480 --> 36:59.449
Don't try to catch me in a lie,
it's humiliating.

36:59.480 --> 37:03.519
I am trying to keep you safe.

37:03.550 --> 37:06.883
If it wasn't Andrew, then, that
means whoever did this to you

37:06.920 --> 37:10.287
is still out there,
is still a threat.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.719
[sighs]

37:11.760 --> 37:14.320
God, I wanna put an end
to this whole thing

37:14.360 --> 37:16.248
once and for all.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.995
I don't think you wanna
put an end to this

37:18.030 --> 37:20.590
so much as you wish
it never happened.

37:20.630 --> 37:22.393
'Well, it did happen.‘

37:22.440 --> 37:24.931
It happened to me,
and it happened to my friends

37:24.970 --> 37:28.633
'and that is not something
that gets forgotten. Ever.'

37:28.680 --> 37:30.409
You know, when I was
down there, I just..

37:30.440 --> 37:32.476
I kept thinking, if we could
just make it out

37:32.510 --> 37:36.014
if we could just survive,
and get out and come back home

37:36.050 --> 37:38.644
'then everything
was gonna be alright.‘

37:38.690 --> 37:40.612
'And then, we did.‘

37:40.650 --> 37:41.912
We're back.

37:43.460 --> 37:46.850
And I don't see a happy ending
coming anytime soon.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.896
I really wish I did.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.267

38:20.860 --> 38:24.057

38:28.570 --> 38:32.438
* Throw myself to the unknown

38:33.710 --> 38:38.807
* Like a skipping stone

38:38.850 --> 38:41.717
* Let go of the water

38:41.750 --> 38:46.084
* I'm letting go

38:46.120 --> 38:49.715
* Surrender to the bottom

38:52.530 --> 38:54.521
* Another storm to fight

38:54.560 --> 38:55.822
* Come and take me

38:55.860 --> 39:01.935

* Forever is a long time

39:08.680 --> 39:12.673
* To be walking
on a fine line *

39:12.710 --> 39:16.578

39:36.000 --> 39:40.733
* Skipping stone

39:40.770 --> 39:43.739

40:43.840 --> 40:45.660
We have some questions

40:45.710 --> 40:47.564
and we want answers, not lies.

40:47.610 --> 40:49.532
Don't talk to me like that.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.172
Not after what you've put
this family through.

40:51.210 --> 40:54.077
- What I've done?
- Jason, you don't understand.

40:54.110 --> 40:55.919
Stop.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.019
You're not gonna
get out of this

40:57.050 --> 40:59.018
by picking a fight with Jason.

40:59.050 --> 41:01.655
It's not gonna work.
Not this time.

41:01.690 --> 41:04.887
I am not gonna be interrogated
in my own house by you two.
