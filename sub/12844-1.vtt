01:20.657 --> 01:28.221
WELCOME TO THE RILEYS

02:01.672 --> 02:04.277
Hey, Riley, you in or you out?

02:13.276 --> 02:15.157
What pickle-slicer joke?

02:15.277 --> 02:18.255
Guy who works at a pickle factory

02:18.375 --> 02:21.156
goes home and tells his wife he
got fired

02:21.276 --> 02:24.094
cause he stuck his dick
in a pickle-slicer... that one.

02:24.214 --> 02:28.777
His wife says Oh, my God, you
stuck your dick in a pickleslicer?

02:28.897 --> 02:30.353
Are you all right?’

02:30.473 --> 02:33.362
And...
he says something back and that's
the part I can't remember... the
funny part.

02:33.482 --> 02:35.863
She asks him if he's all right and
he says,

02:35.983 --> 02:38.669
It's not so bad, they
fired her, too.’

02:38.789 --> 02:41.292
There you go. That's it.

02:41.412 --> 02:44.831
Pretty dumb-ass joke.

03:05.350 --> 03:06.891
How you do tonight?

03:07.166 --> 03:08.963
Broke even...

03:09.385 --> 03:11.237
give or take a grand.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.236
Lost again, huh?

03:13.970 --> 03:17.051
- Who says I've lost?
- "Broke even" means you lost.

03:17.978 --> 03:21.034
- 'I did all right' means you won.
- Who said so?

03:21.298 --> 03:22.330
Me.

03:23.455 --> 03:25.054
I got you down ...

03:25.494 --> 03:27.832
Remind me never
to play poker with you.

03:27.952 --> 03:30.560
Waste of money if you ask me.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.988
Well, I never do ask you. But that
hasn't stopped you from telling me that

03:34.108 --> 03:37.671
every Thursday night for the
last..what?

03:37.791 --> 03:39.035
Hey, Vivian!

03:39.155 --> 03:41.020
Four years.

03:44.194 --> 03:47.060
- There you go.
- Thank you.

03:54.116 --> 03:56.122
Four years?

03:57.806 --> 03:59.812
Am I boring you?

04:00.349 --> 04:03.609
No, ma'am.
Am I boring you?

04:04.182 --> 04:05.920
Not yet.

04:10.302 --> 04:13.167
Waffle Man.

04:14.503 --> 04:20.100
I got this convention I got to go to
in New Orleans at the end of the month

04:23.503 --> 04:26.413
why don't you come along?

04:30.129 --> 04:31.920
- Don't do that.
- What.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.380
- Be unpredictable.
- You'll have fun.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.184
This is New Orleans.
Why not?

04:40.846 --> 04:42.566
I mean it.

04:44.428 --> 04:47.838
- I don't even have a suitcase.
- I'll buy you a suitcase.

04:50.535 --> 04:54.403
How about you buy me
dinner at the "Kantarbari?

04:54.523 --> 04:57.469
I like their spinach salad.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.983
All you want for your birthday is a spinach salad..

05:03.103 --> 05:05.419
When you can have a trip to New Orleans?

05:05.539 --> 05:08.617
- I don't know, I just...
- Just...

05:09.821 --> 05:11.641
Just think about it.

05:15.713 --> 05:17.364
Okay.

05:22.048 --> 05:25.693
Maybe it is time for you
to go home.

05:25.813 --> 05:29.774
-No. -Get some sleep.
-Ten more minutes.

05:32.147 --> 05:33.504
All right.

06:05.953 --> 06:08.099
How was your poker game?

06:08.219 --> 06:10.116
Broke even just about.

06:13.729 --> 06:15.527
Want me to turn out the light?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.837
No.
It doesn't bother me.

06:18.925 --> 06:20.098
Good night.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.151
Sweet dreams.

06:25.509 --> 06:26.902
You too.

07:05.068 --> 07:09.997
..just talk to her about the things she wants to talk.
Don't ask about other things..that's a big can of worms.

07:10.117 --> 07:12.404
We're just gonna take the RV and

07:12.524 --> 07:14.811
park it on heir backyard,

07:15.241 --> 07:18.851
and wait for her to kick the bucket I guess.

07:19.278 --> 07:22.430
Watch over and take care of her til then.

07:23.261 --> 07:25.669
I'm sure going to miss you, Brenda.

07:25.789 --> 07:28.477
Oh Lois, I'm gonna miss you too.

07:31.084 --> 07:35.369
I got my grandkids up here.
I'll be back up here from time to time.

07:35.999 --> 07:39.753
- Would you like some more coffee, Sharon?
- No, thank you, Mrs. Riley.

07:40.384 --> 07:43.049
Call me Lois, honey.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.972
Where is your bathroom?
Coffee goes right through me.

07:48.092 --> 07:51.496
Right at the end of the hall.
You can't miss it.

07:53.754 --> 07:56.835
You'll be in great hands with Sharon.

07:56.955 --> 07:59.271
She's a real ...

08:06.716 --> 08:11.330
Walt's just tired of living in Indianapolis.

08:13.966 --> 08:17.003
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

08:18.327 --> 08:20.591
How old is your daughter?

08:23.253 --> 08:25.861
Did you see Lois’ craft room?

08:26.405 --> 08:29.643
She paints and does pastels and all that.

08:30.417 --> 08:32.337
She's a real artist.

08:44.118 --> 08:46.626
Hey! Hey, Doug!

08:47.252 --> 08:49.939
Hey, um, can I talk to you outside for a sec?

08:50.700 --> 08:52.984
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:59.655 --> 09:01.061
Where is Vivian?

09:02.028 --> 09:04.249
I tried to get a hold of you at your office,

09:04.369 --> 09:07.258
but I didn't want to leave a
message with your secretary.

09:08.979 --> 09:10.627
What message?

09:12.203 --> 09:14.316
Doug, Vivian is dead.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.482
It was a heart attack.

09:49.894 --> 09:53.834
- You going to sit out here all night?
- Just smoking a cigarette.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.025
I wish you wouldn't smoke in the house.

09:58.777 --> 10:00.927
Well, I'm not in the house

10:01.536 --> 10:03.076
I'm in the garage.

10:06.388 --> 10:09.325
When you open the door all
the smoke comes inside.

10:10.149 --> 10:12.298
Then close the door, Lois.

10:26.793 --> 10:32.565
Vivian Danley
1964 - 2009

11:41.544 --> 11:46.092
Emily Riley
Our Precious Daughter
1986 - 2001

11:53.525 --> 11:57.111
FAMILY Reilly

11:57.985 --> 12:03.757
Douglas Lloyd Father 1957 -
Lois Banning Mother 1959...

12:27.916 --> 12:30.658
What are you doing home
so early?

12:33.080 --> 12:34.983
That headstone

12:35.103 --> 12:39.013
you got us at Gold Hill,
that is a unique experience

12:39.715 --> 12:42.006
to see your name
carved on piece of granite.

12:42.789 --> 12:45.888
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not dead.

12:46.631 --> 12:48.340
You're not dead.

12:48.941 --> 12:50.931
There's enough people
out there who are dead.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.944
They need headstones.
We don't because we're not dead.

12:56.064 --> 12:59.416
A lot of people do this, Doug.
It's called pre-planning.

12:59.749 --> 13:00.566
Well...

13:01.205 --> 13:02.914
I don't like having my name

13:03.428 --> 13:06.014
carved on a tombstone,
while I'm still alive.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.103
I can't believe
you did that Lois.

15:26.936 --> 15:28.369
Hello!

15:28.489 --> 15:30.753
- Kinda early, aren't you?
- Oh, yeah.

15:31.297 --> 15:35.166
- Traffic, you know. It's gonna be a bear.
- Doug, let's go!

15:35.940 --> 15:38.347
I just hate driving to the airport.

15:39.763 --> 15:43.918
Do you mind picking up my mail
and newspaper while Doug is gone?

15:44.405 --> 15:46.583
Why can't your neighbor
across the street do it?

15:46.703 --> 15:49.878
- She moved.
- Well, what about your other neighbors?

15:49.998 --> 15:53.187
- Just ‘til Doug gets back.
- Okay.

15:53.207 --> 15:55.939
Have to drive all the way over
here from Zionsville every day

15:56.059 --> 16:00.212
here from Zionsville every day
because my nutcase sister can't
walk down her own damn driveway.

16:00.304 --> 16:06.739
Lois, somehow, someway, someday, you're
just going to have to walk out that door.

16:09.228 --> 16:10.693
Give me a sweet ..

16:38.659 --> 16:43.021
So I sent every truck we owned down to the
construction site, paid off the night watchman,

16:43.573 --> 16:46.673
and we went floor-by-floor and
pulled every one of our fixtures...

16:46.793 --> 16:51.549
faucets, sinks, fire hose valves, drinking
fountains, sprinkler heads... you name it.

16:51.669 --> 16:54.234
Damn lucky they didn't charge
you with breaking and entering.

16:54.354 --> 16:58.323
I'm not gonna stand in the back of the line at
some bullshit bankruptcy hearing. Screw that.

16:58.661 --> 17:01.639
Pay me or I'll repo your broke ass.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.463
That's why it's thirty
days net with us.

17:04.583 --> 17:08.630
Why go ninety days out with someone, I don't
need that kind of suspense?

17:09.444 --> 17:10.779
Right, Doug?

17:11.601 --> 17:14.608
No surprises, that's my motto.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.991
I'm gonna hit the little boys room.

17:25.276 --> 17:28.737
- How are you?
- How you doing?

17:34.678 --> 17:36.833
Hey, Doug? Where are you going?

20:04.967 --> 20:07.546
- How you doing tonight?
- I'm okay.

20:08.538 --> 20:11.833
- How about you?
- Oh, I'm real good. - Good.

20:12.947 --> 20:15.418
You want a private lap dance in a
VIP room?

20:15.538 --> 20:18.570
- What? - Do you want a private
lap dance in the VIP room?

20:18.690 --> 20:22.197
- No. Not right now. Thank you.
- Not right now?

20:22.628 --> 20:23.545
Sorry.

20:24.002 --> 20:27.484
- I'm gonna be off work soon.
- All right. Don't...

20:28.014 --> 20:32.634
Come on. It's right upstairs. Only $ 250 and you
got me and a bottle of champagne for an hour.

20:32.754 --> 20:35.421
- I don't drink champagne.
- I do.

20:35.803 --> 20:37.436
Thank you, but...

20:38.038 --> 20:40.588
Come on. An hour just you and me.

20:40.708 --> 20:44.572
<i>Whoa! This is perfect!</i>

20:45.589 --> 20:47.824
- You know those guys?
- Yeah.

20:48.477 --> 20:49.944
You want the room?

20:51.314 --> 20:52.575
All right.

20:52.695 --> 20:53.922
Come with me.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.262
Make yourself confortable.

21:22.140 --> 21:24.690
I'm Mallory.
What is your name?

21:25.091 --> 21:26.237
Doug.

21:27.011 --> 21:29.814
- It's nice to meet you, Doug!
- Nice to meet you too.

21:29.934 --> 21:33.539
- We actually got to wait for the drinks to
come before we can have any fun. - All right.

21:33.659 --> 21:35.459
Well, hold on.

21:36.949 --> 21:39.929
I'm not here for the "fun" part.

21:41.442 --> 21:42.218
Oh..

21:43.942 --> 21:44.618
Well...

21:45.881 --> 21:47.136
Hand-jobs are 50

21:47.256 --> 21:51.532
and I can do oral, but it's a hundred and

21:51.929 --> 21:53.723
you'll need an rubber.
- No, thank you.

21:56.401 --> 21:59.011
I get 60 out of the 250 you
gave the guy at the bar.

22:00.161 --> 22:02.648
- You're not going to tip me nothing?
- All right.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.356
- Here. Will this make it
worth your while? - Wow.

22:11.627 --> 22:12.566
<i>Knock-knock.</i>

22:12.860 --> 22:14.474
Thanks, Doug.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.677
Hi.

22:17.217 --> 22:18.449
There you go.

22:20.334 --> 22:24.164
I'll need to sign this for downstairs.
Plus the champagne.

22:28.330 --> 22:29.460
Hey, Tara.

22:31.124 --> 22:32.078
Here you go.

22:32.841 --> 22:34.454
You gonna tip the girl?

22:36.919 --> 22:39.531
- Wouldn't want to forget to do that.
- No, we wouldn't.

22:42.342 --> 22:43.692
- There you go.
- Thanks.

22:45.247 --> 22:47.389
Y'all have a good time, okay?

22:49.017 --> 22:51.277
Come here it's okay.
Over here.

22:52.494 --> 22:55.165
I really, really like older guys.

22:55.803 --> 22:58.825
- It get's me really wet.
- Sweetheart, sweetheart just...

23:00.747 --> 23:02.757
sit still. Sit still.

23:05.813 --> 23:07.677
You don't want to have any fun?

23:07.999 --> 23:10.083
How about we just talk?

23:10.203 --> 23:12.621
You want me to talk dirty so
you can get yourself off?

23:12.741 --> 23:14.528
Jesus Christ, no! No.

23:21.136 --> 23:24.551
All right, you don't have
to get mad at me lt's fine.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.936
I'm not mad.

23:27.738 --> 23:29.962
You're just persistent, that's all.

23:31.803 --> 23:35.906
- Just trying to keep the customers happy.
- I'm happy, I'm happy...

23:37.626 --> 23:39.574
You don't look very happy.

23:53.068 --> 23:54.695
How old are you?

23:55.498 --> 23:57.996
- How old do I look?
- 15.

23:58.592 --> 24:01.000
You can't be 15 and work in any
strip club I've ever heard of.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.856
- How old are you?
- 22.

24:03.246 --> 24:04.805
You don't look 22.

24:05.364 --> 24:07.221
That's what it says on my ID.

24:07.341 --> 24:12.241
Well, I can buy a drivers license that says I'm 22.
That doesn't make me 22.

24:14.213 --> 24:16.597
So, is Mallory your real name?

24:17.566 --> 24:20.408
- Oh, fuck me, you're a fucking cop.
- No.

24:20.528 --> 24:23.411
Oh, you're not a cop?
Come here, show me your cock then!

24:23.531 --> 24:25.108
Stop it! Stop that!

24:25.228 --> 24:27.638
- Prove you're not a cop!
- I'm not a cop!

24:27.758 --> 24:30.710
Take this fucking back! ‘Cause that's as
close to my pussy as you're getting tonight.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.315
Fuck nuts!

24:50.002 --> 24:53.051
- Hey, how's it shaking, baby?
- It ain't.

24:53.171 --> 24:59.745
- Felix kicked me out early. Too many girls in tonight.
- Meatball.. to go. Thanks.

25:18.428 --> 25:21.110
Excuse me, I'm not a cop.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.824
I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.048
I run a

25:27.437 --> 25:31.999
wholesale plumbing supply business.
I'm here for a convention.

25:41.866 --> 25:43.860
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

25:45.419 --> 25:48.486
I just got cops on the brain.
Can't help it.

25:48.606 --> 25:50.944
Always snooping around the club..

25:51.291 --> 25:53.878
And they towed my car for
unpaid parking tickets

25:53.998 --> 25:57.251
it's like thirty-five bucks a day in
storage fees and I don't got that..

25:57.371 --> 26:00.438
It's been in there for like a week, and
how the fuck am I going to get it out.

26:00.836 --> 26:02.006
It's what it is..

26:03.175 --> 26:04.825
So I don't like cops.

26:07.439 --> 26:08.791
How much do you owe?

26:09.433 --> 26:12.803
1100 for the tickets and uh..

26:13.651 --> 26:16.219
However much thirtyfive
times seven is.

26:16.632 --> 26:19.555
- 245 dollars.
- How much is that all together?

26:20.564 --> 26:25.676
Well, 1100 plus 245 is 1345 dollars.

26:28.243 --> 26:29.252
Oh, fuck me.

26:32.118 --> 26:34.250
You have a terrible vocabulary.

26:36.153 --> 26:37.230
Fuck you.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.255
All right.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.624
I didn't.. mean that.

26:43.771 --> 26:45.108
That way.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.771
Here you go, babe.

27:02.793 --> 27:04.375
Anyway

27:08.776 --> 27:10.839
I got it, I got it.

27:14.530 --> 27:15.888
Sorry.

27:20.157 --> 27:22.198
- Where are you from?
- Why?

27:23.917 --> 27:26.301
Just making conversation.

27:30.084 --> 27:31.303
From Florida.

27:33.114 --> 27:34.650
Where in Florida?

27:36.188 --> 27:38.320
- Panhandle.
- And you work in a. ..

27:38.559 --> 27:39.865
.. strip club.

27:41.112 --> 27:43.504
It's better than working
peepshows in Atlanta.

27:45.992 --> 27:50.789
Guys jerking off staring at your cooter like it
was singing The Star Spangled-fucking Banner.

27:56.489 --> 27:57.546
Here you go.

28:14.176 --> 28:16.817
Hey, you...
you think

28:17.814 --> 28:21.350
I mean, you know, now that
I know you're not a cop..

28:23.507 --> 28:25.605
You think I can have those
hundred bucks back?

28:27.395 --> 28:30.109
I mean, you said you only wanted to talk, right?
And we've been talking.

28:31.907 --> 28:35.234
- Here. - I can do something else
for your money too, if you want.

28:39.315 --> 28:40.586
You can have your money back.

28:41.419 --> 28:43.672
- Enjoy. - No, thanks. Thank you.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.924
It's getting late.
I'll take you home.

28:57.315 --> 28:59.428
It's just .. down this street.
So just..

29:02.025 --> 29:03.976
This is your neighborhood?

29:05.072 --> 29:05.850
Yup.

29:09.928 --> 29:12.422
It's this whitish one, right here.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.819
Do you mind coming in
with me for a second?

29:19.201 --> 29:21.827
Just to make sure it's chill.
My electricity is off.

29:23.807 --> 29:24.658
All right.

29:36.329 --> 29:37.650
Motherfucker.

29:45.807 --> 29:48.712
You shouldn't keep your
key in your mailbox.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.162
I'd just lose it if I didn't.

30:03.530 --> 30:04.469
Jesus.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.171
You weren't kidding.

30:06.707 --> 30:07.778
I know.

30:08.878 --> 30:10.873
The place gets really fucking creepy.

30:37.891 --> 30:40.107
How come you haven't you
paid your electric bill?

30:41.683 --> 30:42.872
I have.

30:45.557 --> 30:47.861
My landlord keeps locking the fuse box.

30:48.110 --> 30:50.237
It's supposed to be included in the rent.
But he is like this ..

30:51.558 --> 30:55.564
He's like this freak who wants me to
suck him off while he videotapes it.

30:55.684 --> 30:58.395
He's a regular at the club.
That's like this whole scam he's got going.

30:58.681 --> 31:01.220
He only rents the place to strippers.

31:02.276 --> 31:03.743
But I told him, you know like

31:03.985 --> 31:05.511
I'm not gonna do blow-job videos

31:05.631 --> 31:07.740
and I'm not leaving
'cause I got my rights.

31:09.193 --> 31:11.012
And he tries to scam me with this,

31:11.364 --> 31:13.990
'for sale' sign shit, like yeah

31:14.629 --> 31:16.888
like people are dying to buy this shit.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.360
- You want to smoke a splif?
- What?

31:23.579 --> 31:24.694
Like a doobi.

31:25.192 --> 31:27.496
- You know, like a joint, weed..
- Marijuana?

31:30.327 --> 31:30.980
Yeah.

31:32.711 --> 31:34.325
I haven't smoked marijuana in...

31:35.000 --> 31:36.130
29 years.

31:43.304 --> 31:45.285
- What's so funny?
- This whole night.

31:48.966 --> 31:50.756
I feel like I landed on Mars.

31:51.005 --> 31:51.709
Well...

31:52.179 --> 31:53.705
Welcome to New Orleans.

32:56.677 --> 32:58.393
How come you don't want to fuck me?

32:59.963 --> 33:02.340
- Prefer women of my own age.
- Why?

33:04.482 --> 33:05.861
They know what they're doing.

33:08.378 --> 33:10.065
I'm pretty good.

33:10.185 --> 33:11.415
Sure you are.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.237
I think I give some pretty good heads.

33:15.357 --> 33:17.511
I'm sure you do.

33:18.373 --> 33:20.805
- Want me to show you?
- No. No!

33:23.206 --> 33:24.251
Lay down.

33:28.298 --> 33:29.762
Its so weird

33:31.615 --> 33:34.601
being with a guy who
don't want to get it on.

33:36.716 --> 33:38.160
Oh well...

33:38.596 --> 33:41.072
it's pretty weird being with you, too.

33:43.662 --> 33:45.129
You don't like me?

33:46.619 --> 33:49.141
I do. I like you a lot.

33:52.653 --> 33:54.395
I like to...

34:14.101 --> 34:15.706
I like you, too.

34:56.167 --> 34:58.597
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.249
I...

35:01.350 --> 35:03.275
- overslept.
- Goddamn

35:03.757 --> 35:06.026
I banged on your door
for five minutes.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.356
Are you all right?

35:09.266 --> 35:09.931
Yeah.

35:10.687 --> 35:11.994
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:12.338 --> 35:14.470
Why didn't check in with Lois yet?

35:14.590 --> 35:16.264
I just talked with Harriet.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.052
I forgot.

35:18.762 --> 35:21.078
- I forgot.
- Are you sure you're all right?

35:21.198 --> 35:23.164
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

35:23.284 --> 35:25.090
I'll see you at the convention.

35:25.686 --> 35:26.511
Huh?

36:46.960 --> 36:49.734
And get that jacket of
yours back from that girl.

36:52.347 --> 36:55.098
Stop loaning your things to people.

37:55.483 --> 37:57.833
- Riley residence.
- Hi.

37:59.392 --> 38:02.315
I'm sorry I didn't call,
when I got in last night.

38:04.521 --> 38:09.020
I checked your flight on the internet
... So I know you didn't crash.

38:10.321 --> 38:12.040
How is New Orleans?

38:12.413 --> 38:16.367
Listen, I think I'm going
to stay here for a while.

38:19.591 --> 38:22.858
- I can't come home right now.
- What are you talking about?

38:23.317 --> 38:25.093
I don't know, I don't know...

38:25.781 --> 38:28.102
I just know that..

38:28.560 --> 38:31.211
I can't come home right now.

38:32.249 --> 38:35.008
I know I'm not dead yet.

38:37.049 --> 38:39.055
- All right?
- Doug!

38:42.664 --> 38:44.957
I'm not mad about Vivian.

38:45.783 --> 38:47.070
What?

38:47.681 --> 38:53.162
A year or two ago I found her name tag
in the pocket of your windbreaker.

38:54.129 --> 38:58.248
It's not like I had no
idea what was going on.

38:59.396 --> 39:01.509
And I know I haven't been..

39:06.703 --> 39:09.702
- Oh, Lord..
- I'm sorry. I...

39:23.114 --> 39:26.942
- I'll make a list of people you got to take care of.
- Okay, I will. We got a deal?

39:27.062 --> 39:29.991
- Not yet, but almost.
- You got the money?

39:30.816 --> 39:33.957
- Almost. - Okay.
- Not guilty.

39:35.259 --> 39:37.391
Morning, Hank. How are you?

39:37.511 --> 39:40.440
We sure had some French Quarter
fun last night, didn't we?

39:40.560 --> 39:45.117
I took Jerry to the swankiest strip joint in
the Quarter, and I'm talking tender to the bone.

39:46.664 --> 39:49.209
- Give us a minute, will you?
- You bet.

39:49.329 --> 39:52.963
We're gonna have ourselves a good time
tonight boys, so take your vitamins.

39:53.083 --> 39:55.215
I like the blue ones myself.

39:56.774 --> 39:59.732
- So, what's up?
- I'm selling Circle City.

40:00.562 --> 40:02.328
Are you fucking nuts?

40:03.107 --> 40:04.689
What's going on with you?

40:04.809 --> 40:08.930
You're gonna make a good profit on your shares
and you're gonna get a nice ..to run the company.

40:09.050 --> 40:11.612
- Doug, don't do this to me.
- Do what?

40:11.732 --> 40:13.909
Make you richer? You'll get over it.

40:14.486 --> 40:17.489
Wait, goddamit, so what..I mean

40:17.924 --> 40:21.432
- What are going to do?
You just gonna pull the plug? - Yep.

40:21.799 --> 40:24.366
Christ, Doug. Where the hell are you going now?

40:24.486 --> 40:27.653
I need a pair of bolt
cutters and a toilet snake.

40:40.682 --> 40:41.965
Morning.

41:12.701 --> 41:16.483
Turn on the water in the tub
so I can rinse this thing off.

41:18.546 --> 41:20.640
Oh my God, I'm outta here!

42:31.638 --> 42:36.160
<i>To Viv, from your Waffle
Man, Happy Birthday</i>

43:34.892 --> 43:37.620
I've got a business
proposition for you.

43:41.687 --> 43:43.606
Well, I told that I
don't do porn tapes.

43:43.939 --> 43:46.241
And I'm not gonna fuck a German
Shepperd, not going to..

43:46.361 --> 43:49.274
Can I just talk for a minute?

43:50.573 --> 43:52.305
Yes, but the answer is no.

43:57.220 --> 43:59.846
I'll give you 100 dollars a
day to stay at your place.

44:00.980 --> 44:01.758
What?

44:02.242 --> 44:04.986
$ 100 a day, if I can
stay at your place.

44:05.311 --> 44:06.647
I don't like hotels.

44:09.390 --> 44:10.505
No pussy?

44:12.493 --> 44:13.182
No.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.259
And don't do anal.
Just so you know.

44:20.547 --> 44:22.484
Thank God there is
something you don't do.

44:27.297 --> 44:29.996
So, a hundred bucks a day, and
you just live in my house?

44:30.116 --> 44:30.803
Yep.

44:33.528 --> 44:35.941
So you'll be my sugar daddy?

44:37.117 --> 44:39.296
- You know what that is?
- Sort of.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.855
Wiil you buy me cool things?

44:44.469 --> 44:46.494
I'll buy you a broom and dustpan.

45:21.505 --> 45:25.448
It's me, Charlene, Mrs Riley.
You remember me, don't you?

45:26.592 --> 45:30.223
I saw the garage open and it didn't
look right to me. Are you okay?

45:30.343 --> 45:32.406
Taking a nap.

45:33.341 --> 45:35.340
Want your paper?

45:37.541 --> 45:39.815
Put it on the hood, please.

45:51.585 --> 45:55.015
You shouldn't leave your
garage door open like that.

45:56.243 --> 45:57.087
I know.

45:58.352 --> 45:59.343
Thank you.

46:00.425 --> 46:01.910
Good to see you,

46:02.442 --> 46:04.038
it's been a long time.

46:37.028 --> 46:38.771
- Good evening.
- Hi.

46:39.926 --> 46:41.595
- Who are you?
- Doug.

46:42.585 --> 46:43.722
Who are you?

46:44.254 --> 46:46.693
- Is Bridget home?
- Who?

46:47.620 --> 46:49.371
You know, Bridget.

46:50.737 --> 46:51.930
Roxy?

46:53.370 --> 46:56.598
- Jennifer...
- Mallory. - Yeah! Mallory.

46:57.038 --> 46:58.139
She home?

46:58.982 --> 47:01.238
- No, she's at work.
- Oh. Saw the lights on.

47:06.341 --> 47:09.972
- You wanna leave her a message or...
- Just dropping by.

47:10.449 --> 47:13.475
No big thing.
Another time.

47:23.160 --> 47:24.498
Good night.

47:41.595 --> 47:45.355
I got a lot of 20's tonight.
It's crazy.

47:51.155 --> 47:54.291
Here is another...ouch! Fucker.

47:55.396 --> 47:56.616
Ten...

47:59.114 --> 48:00.090
Twenty.

48:01.856 --> 48:03.743
Okay, that's thirty...

48:05.164 --> 48:07.295
First of all, put your
money in the right order.

48:07.915 --> 48:10.948
Twentys, tens, fives, ones.

48:12.213 --> 48:15.509
- Okay, chill out.
- Show your money some respect.

48:16.091 --> 48:18.530
Oh, I respect money!

48:19.818 --> 48:21.175
Oh, Fuck.

48:24.366 --> 48:27.253
God! Someone opened
a can of tuna fish.

48:32.094 --> 48:35.285
And I bet your balls smell just
like apple fritters, right?

48:35.405 --> 48:38.340
I wouldn't know... I don't keep
my money in my underpants.

48:38.835 --> 48:41.531
Well, You would if you did what I do.

48:42.503 --> 48:45.327
I know girls who keep money
inside their cooters.

48:46.249 --> 48:49.348
I guess it's, you know, a safety thing..
What's your problem?

48:50.559 --> 48:54.722
I don't know, I guess I'm just not
used to being around young women

48:55.895 --> 48:58.830
who talk about their..private parts.

49:03.039 --> 49:05.632
Like, hello?
I have private parts?

49:15.847 --> 49:18.580
Wait till you see your house.

50:43.869 --> 50:49.188
All right, the top of the sheet,
matches the top of the bed.

50:52.141 --> 50:53.293
See?

50:53.866 --> 50:55.906
Level, right here...

50:56.594 --> 51:00.606
- Just straighting it out. - It looks pretty good to me.
- Both sides even? - Yeah.

51:01.738 --> 51:04.237
They do, huh?
This side's too long.

51:06.575 --> 51:08.684
Well, they're both too long.

51:09.005 --> 51:11.618
- Does it really make that
much of a difference? - Yes.

51:12.491 --> 51:16.136
All right, now tuck it in.
Over here. Under.

51:17.558 --> 51:18.910
Tight.

51:22.241 --> 51:24.648
Okay, now,

51:25.725 --> 51:28.499
This is the tough part.
Come here.

51:32.190 --> 51:34.460
45 degree angle.

51:36.644 --> 51:39.785
'45 degree'... where
do you get this shit?

51:39.905 --> 51:42.788
What? Nobody taught you
how to make a bed before?

51:43.107 --> 51:45.835
There, you see, now it's tight.

51:48.540 --> 51:50.420
Put your hand here.

51:53.492 --> 51:57.824
You know, I'm really not some kind of fucking
idiot, who doesn't even know how to make a bed.

51:59.588 --> 52:01.583
I didn't mean to imply that.

52:06.145 --> 52:08.804
Ok, you tuck it here, tuck it under..

52:08.924 --> 52:11.326
Well then, maybe you shouldn't say shit like that.

52:11.860 --> 52:14.932
And..and think that I should know
shit that I haven't figured out yet.

52:15.643 --> 52:16.674
Okay.

52:17.546 --> 52:19.127
Ok, I'm sorry.

52:24.927 --> 52:26.142
All right.

52:32.406 --> 52:33.759
Okay?

52:36.395 --> 52:37.450
Yeah, okay.

53:20.511 --> 53:22.445
Where you headed?

53:23.054 --> 53:25.132
New Orleans.

53:26.600 --> 53:29.537
I like New Orleans.
Pretty special place.

53:30.505 --> 53:32.797
- Is it?
- Yeah.

53:33.872 --> 53:35.949
But I like about anywhere.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.206
Except Vegas

53:38.326 --> 53:40.248
don't like places invented to

53:40.368 --> 53:43.854
don't like places hold you upside down and
shake all the money out of your pockets.

53:44.725 --> 53:47.522
Name's Roger.
What's yours?

53:48.383 --> 53:49.300
Lois.

53:50.057 --> 53:52.464
You married to Superman, Lois?

53:56.062 --> 53:57.768
But you are married, right?

53:58.850 --> 54:00.745
Thirty years next June.

54:01.479 --> 54:04.377
You're too young too
be married that long.

54:06.596 --> 54:08.100
Am I bothering you?

54:10.298 --> 54:12.132
I'm just not used to...

54:12.462 --> 54:15.580
Not used to talking to strangers?
It's all I do.

54:16.234 --> 54:18.985
Talk to strangers.
Comes with the job.

54:28.295 --> 54:29.660
Got kids?

54:30.833 --> 54:31.714
No.

54:34.725 --> 54:36.266
- Do you?
- No.

54:43.194 --> 54:44.925
Think I might be able
to buy you a drink?

54:47.669 --> 54:50.236
Ummm...I don't think
they serve liquor here.

54:50.999 --> 54:53.977
No. There's a bar, up the road a piece

54:54.359 --> 54:56.545
Nice place, real clean.

54:59.054 --> 55:00.125
It's okay.

55:00.245 --> 55:03.793
Bet you get tired of guys always
trying to get personal with you.

55:04.277 --> 55:06.947
No, I wouldn't say that exactly.

55:10.533 --> 55:12.485
It's been a long time since..

55:17.032 --> 55:19.527
Anything...everything.

55:23.136 --> 55:25.028
It's nice of you to ask me.

55:27.097 --> 55:29.709
I'm flattered.
I mean that.

55:32.476 --> 55:33.356
Well, I...

55:34.119 --> 55:36.041
Better hit the road.
Yeah, me too

55:36.599 --> 55:38.799
Nice talking to you, Lois.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.237
Nice talking to you, too.

56:13.629 --> 56:16.239
<i>Doug, I just got ripped off!</i>

56:17.577 --> 56:18.568
What?

56:18.688 --> 56:21.905
<i>All my fucking money is gone, I'm
gonna fucking kill this guy!</i>

56:23.409 --> 56:25.335
All right. Calm down.
Where are you?

56:25.455 --> 56:27.646
I'm at the ..
Hotel, you don't know where it is.

56:35.222 --> 56:36.285
You all right?

56:37.973 --> 56:42.503
- Yeah, I just can't stand on the street without the cops
coming by me like I'm a fuckin crack whore. - What happened?

56:42.623 --> 56:45.235
I came here with this guy and uh..

56:45.529 --> 56:48.078
He kept trying to stick it up
my fuckin ass and I was like

56:48.395 --> 56:52.026
pencil dick back the fuck
up and he wouldn't so

56:52.503 --> 56:55.620
I went to piss and I came back out,
and my wallet's sitting on the bed

56:55.740 --> 57:00.370
and all my shit is everywhere, and he's cars gone,
and all I've got is fuckin shoes and like..

57:01.159 --> 57:04.497
- I'm out 900 bucks.
- $ 900?

57:05.708 --> 57:08.367
Why-in-the-hell would you carry
that much money around with you?

57:08.991 --> 57:12.053
- Where else am I gonna keep it?
- I don't know. In the bank?

57:12.384 --> 57:14.694
What? I don't have a
fucking bank account!

57:15.813 --> 57:18.821
And this fucking asshole won't
give me the guy's address

57:18.941 --> 57:22.902
- because he's fucking friends with him. I'm gonna fuckin kill him!
- Hey! Hey!

57:23.022 --> 57:27.028
- And what are you going to do with his address?
- I'm gonna go get my money back.

57:27.713 --> 57:30.145
Uh, no, you're not.
Your either going to call the police

57:30.370 --> 57:31.638
Or you're gonna drop it.

57:31.929 --> 57:34.154
I can't call the police, Doug!

57:34.827 --> 57:38.038
- Don't be so fucking stupid, just help me!
- I'm stupid?

57:39.156 --> 57:42.048
You bring 900 dollars to a place
like this, and I'm stupid?

57:43.230 --> 57:46.047
Come here with assholes from that club.

57:46.798 --> 57:50.319
- That's stupid, that's really stupid!
- Yeah, okay, I'm really fucking stupid!

57:50.836 --> 57:51.859
Where are you going?

57:52.197 --> 57:55.136
- I'm gonna go turn some tricks so I can
make my money back. - No, no you're not!

57:55.553 --> 57:56.990
Come on, we're going home.

57:59.441 --> 58:02.220
Then go ahead!
Go ahead, goddamnit!

58:06.947 --> 58:07.849
Okay.

58:08.938 --> 58:09.858
Okay.

58:11.622 --> 58:12.806
I mean fuckin...

58:15.575 --> 58:18.063
fuckin everything..

58:19.936 --> 58:21.411
Always...

58:23.026 --> 58:24.847
like my whole life...

58:25.411 --> 58:26.668
I..

58:34.677 --> 58:36.348
Since forever...

58:37.015 --> 58:38.640
forever...
- I know.

58:39.143 --> 58:40.044
I know.

58:42.222 --> 58:43.532
You'll be okay.

58:45.297 --> 58:46.020
Look at me.

01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:50.187
You up yet?

01:00:50.637 --> 01:00:52.018
Go away.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.266
- You gonna sleep all day?
- Fuck off.

01:00:58.224 --> 01:00:59.764
Come on, let's go.

01:01:09.258 --> 01:01:10.667
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

01:01:10.787 --> 01:01:13.296
- Going to the laundromat.
- What the fuck time is it?

01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:16.790
It's two-fifteen in the afternoon.
Come on. Let's get moving.

01:01:21.696 --> 01:01:22.884
What are you doing?

01:01:23.004 --> 01:01:26.499
Laundry. You wanna do laundry?
Here, wash my laundry for me.

01:01:28.859 --> 01:01:32.532
- You break my heart... - Why?
Because you want to fuck me and you can't?

01:01:50.617 --> 01:01:53.093
Come on.
We're going to the laundromat.

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:55.640
Let's go!

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.754
Can you give me my money today?

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:02.496
Put your clothes on. - Give me my fucking
money or get the fuck out of my house!

01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:10.879
Here, here's your money.

01:02:15.683 --> 01:02:16.763
You know what?

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:19.744
You want to parade around
here in your birthday suit?

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:22.389
If displaying your vagina is
the only way you can feel

01:02:22.509 --> 01:02:24.195
in control then knock yourself out.

01:02:24.432 --> 01:02:26.282
But I'm tired of your language.

01:02:26.402 --> 01:02:29.274
Especially the word 'fuck' in all
of its various permutations.

01:02:29.565 --> 01:02:31.931
Now, I know it's your only adjective,
but it makes you sound cheap

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:34.356
and immature and uneducated.

01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:37.135
And that may be the truth,
but why advertise it?

01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:41.201
Now, starting today I'm docking you a
dollar every time you use that word.

01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:43.579
So get up,

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:44.941
get dressed,

01:02:45.176 --> 01:02:47.035
get in the shower, brush your teeth

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.575
let's go.

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.622
Let's go!

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.206
Let's go.

01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:40.158
Don't be mad at me.

01:03:44.002 --> 01:03:47.147
I don't like being told what to do.
I can't help it.

01:03:49.795 --> 01:03:51.664
And I'll lay off the curse words

01:03:52.054 --> 01:03:53.829
I will, I promise.
Okay?

01:03:56.974 --> 01:03:59.284
Goddamnit, Doug, please!
Don't be mad at me!

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:01.125
I'm not mad at you.

01:04:01.245 --> 01:04:05.153
- You 're acting like you're mad at me!
- No, I'm not acting like I'm mad at you.

01:04:05.588 --> 01:04:06.968
Come on, sit down.

01:04:09.917 --> 01:04:10.959
Take it easy.

01:04:21.438 --> 01:04:22.452
Come here.

01:04:23.335 --> 01:04:24.659
Come here, come on.

01:04:44.206 --> 01:04:45.577
Just..just don't be mad at me.
You can't.

01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:07.464
Hello?

01:05:08.797 --> 01:05:09.483
Hi.

01:05:11.431 --> 01:05:12.398
Hey.

01:05:15.449 --> 01:05:16.783
I called you last night.

01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:19.905
You must have gone to bed.

01:05:20.586 --> 01:05:22.910
- Did you get my message?
- I'm here.

01:05:23.902 --> 01:05:27.066
- Well, like I said last night.
I'm very sorry about not

01:05:27.292 --> 01:05:29.310
- I'm here.
- What?

01:05:30.822 --> 01:05:32.071
I know you are.

01:05:32.191 --> 01:05:33.864
- And I appreciate it.
- Damnit.

01:05:33.984 --> 01:05:35.469
Doug, I'm here

01:05:35.713 --> 01:05:37.469
in New Orleans.

01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:40.216
I was supposed to get off on

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:42.047
Beysan Steet

01:05:42.167 --> 01:05:44.319
and somehow I got on Royal

01:05:44.439 --> 01:05:47.027
I'm really out of directions now.

01:05:49.233 --> 01:05:51.280
- You're in New Orleans?
- Yes!

01:05:51.853 --> 01:05:54.773
- I drove down.
- You drove down?

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:57.179
You know I don't like airplanes.

01:05:57.299 --> 01:06:00.399
- Jesus Christ...
you drove down from Indianapolis? - Yes.

01:06:02.108 --> 01:06:04.176
- By yourself?
- Yes.

01:06:04.542 --> 01:06:08.195
You're not going to be happy when
you see your car, but

01:06:08.899 --> 01:06:11.575
...I'm here.
- Where did you say you are?

01:06:12.433 --> 01:06:15.428
Yeah, 'Royal' and...
hold on.

01:06:20.296 --> 01:06:23.029
"Orleans".
- "Royal" and "Orleans".

01:06:23.733 --> 01:06:25.648
All right, just stay there.

01:06:26.165 --> 01:06:29.473
- Stay right there, I'm gonna
come get you. - Great.

01:06:56.377 --> 01:06:59.069
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where Royal and Orleans is?

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:02.536
Two blocks past Jackson Square there,
make a right and up two blocks.

01:07:02.656 --> 01:07:05.576
Well, that's my car right t, here
here are the keys. I'll be back.

01:07:05.696 --> 01:07:09.440
-You park there, you're going to get yourself
towed real quick. - Then tow it, it's a rental.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.662
Excuse me.
Sorry.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.447
Surprise!

01:08:16.046 --> 01:08:18.103
I would’ve left a lot sooner if

01:08:18.723 --> 01:08:21.446
I'd known it would get
you out of the house.

01:08:21.758 --> 01:08:24.960
I'm not even on my pills,
if you can believe that.

01:08:25.383 --> 01:08:28.615
- You feeling all right?
- I feel all right.

01:08:31.291 --> 01:08:32.654
I haven't seen you in the...

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:35.678
daylight in a long time.

01:08:36.805 --> 01:08:38.475
You look beautiful.

01:08:41.761 --> 01:08:43.703
So good to see you.

01:08:53.488 --> 01:08:54.737
You want a drink?

01:08:54.957 --> 01:08:56.675
Or something to eat?

01:08:57.145 --> 01:08:59.895
Someplace I can freshen
up a little first.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.288
Your hotel, or something...

01:09:06.551 --> 01:09:09.529
Well, I guess there's somebody
that I want you to meet.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.220
First.

01:09:13.812 --> 01:09:14.872
Okay?

01:09:14.993 --> 01:09:16.075
Well..okay!

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:18.009
Where's the car?

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.359
I't's over here.

01:09:20.054 --> 01:09:21.434
I got a ticket.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.615
Well, that's all right. I got towed.

01:09:25.734 --> 01:09:29.005
Yeah, I did. I left it on the
corner, up on the sidewalk...

01:09:50.627 --> 01:09:53.332
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

01:10:08.176 --> 01:10:10.239
Here we are.

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:19.989
- Quite a shade of green!
- Not that one.

01:10:20.768 --> 01:10:21.937
That one.

01:10:23.455 --> 01:10:25.289
You can't be serious.

01:10:27.215 --> 01:10:28.751
Come on inside.

01:10:30.654 --> 01:10:33.405
The person you want me
to meet lives in here?

01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:35.583
Her name's Mallory... well,

01:10:36.545 --> 01:10:38.540
real name is Alison.

01:10:39.312 --> 01:10:43.920
She's got lots of names 'cause she works
at the strip-club. - She's a stripper?

01:10:45.777 --> 01:10:50.774
- You'll understand once you meet her. - Understand what?
That you’ve lost your mind? Jesus, Doug...

01:10:51.659 --> 01:10:54.342
Lois, just come inside.

01:10:55.992 --> 01:10:58.056
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:58.606 --> 01:11:01.586
- Where did you go running off to?
- Well...uh

01:11:01.706 --> 01:11:04.612
Mallory, this is my wife, Lois.
Lois, this is Mallory.

01:11:09.637 --> 01:11:11.539
Hey, how you doing?

01:11:13.809 --> 01:11:14.565
Lois?

01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:19.095
Hey, Doug, Tara's gonna give me a ride
home from work so you don't have to.

01:11:19.701 --> 01:11:21.156
And I'm going early so..

01:11:21.713 --> 01:11:23.187
- Lois, hold up!
- No!

01:11:23.307 --> 01:11:24.361
Hold up, Lois!

01:11:24.784 --> 01:11:25.788
Hold up!

01:11:26.276 --> 01:11:28.408
- Come here!
- No! You're crazy!

01:11:28.642 --> 01:11:31.863
- Okay, calm down! - This is insane!
She's just a child!

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:35.118
She's a sixteen-year-old
runaway from Florida.

01:11:35.776 --> 01:11:37.250
Okay? All right.

01:11:37.719 --> 01:11:39.926
What do you think you are you doing?

01:11:40.686 --> 01:11:41.738
I don't know.

01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:45.083
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, okay?

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.506
No, no, no,
this is a nightmare!

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.317
Just calm down and talk to me.

01:11:54.457 --> 01:11:55.987
Doug, let go of me.

01:11:56.391 --> 01:11:57.668
- Let...
- Okay.

01:11:58.325 --> 01:11:59.546
- Calm down.
- No, I...

01:12:00.354 --> 01:12:02.382
I have made a terrible mistake.

01:12:06.703 --> 01:12:07.595
All rightl.

01:12:08.881 --> 01:12:10.093
Maybe you have.

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:13.590
Take the keys

01:12:13.965 --> 01:12:15.637
drive down to Indianapolis

01:12:15.757 --> 01:12:18.350
and lock yourself up in
your goddamn house again.

01:13:26.355 --> 01:13:28.656
<i>So, it's your job to take care of her?
- Why not?</i>

01:13:30.235 --> 01:13:33.939
For Heaven's sake, Doug, she's not
a stray cat... she's a child.

01:13:34.465 --> 01:13:36.277
I got no one else to care care of.

01:13:37.676 --> 01:13:38.859
What about me?

01:13:44.718 --> 01:13:48.351
- Want another beer?
- I said, 'What about me?'

01:13:49.121 --> 01:13:50.896
I'm your wife, damn it!

01:13:51.441 --> 01:13:54.229
You don't just walk
away after 30 years.

01:13:54.673 --> 01:13:58.598
You don't just call one day and say:
"Oh, by the way, I'm not coming home."

01:13:58.887 --> 01:13:59.554
No!

01:14:00.192 --> 01:14:01.723
That's not the way it works.

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:05.366
You tell me what you want, Doug.

01:14:06.737 --> 01:14:07.676
I don't know.

01:14:09.782 --> 01:14:11.678
Want to..run away?

01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:14.157
Want to hide?

01:14:15.277 --> 01:14:16.160
Maybe.

01:14:16.873 --> 01:14:20.535
You want to pretend that some
runaway stripper is your daughter?

01:14:40.715 --> 01:14:41.785
What time is it?

01:14:46.726 --> 01:14:48.801
I'm selling Circle City.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.685
To this fella from New Orleans

01:14:58.587 --> 01:15:01.385
wants to show me a written offer.

01:15:02.615 --> 01:15:04.709
He's over at the .. hotel.

01:15:05.575 --> 01:15:08.459
I'm supposed to meet him in
the lobby in a half hour.

01:15:11.783 --> 01:15:13.483
I'll get you a room there.

01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:15.654
It's a nice place.

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:21.280
Where are you staying?

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:23.421
Here.

01:15:25.553 --> 01:15:26.539
With Mallory.

01:15:29.413 --> 01:15:31.150
I'll stay here too then.

01:15:34.183 --> 01:15:36.116
You can leave me if you have to.

01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:39.046
But I will never leave you.

01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:42.223
So you just...

01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:45.200
do what you have to do here, huh?

01:16:27.513 --> 01:16:29.626
Hey, sorry. I didn't mean to wake up.

01:16:30.647 --> 01:16:32.971
It's all right.
It's been a long day.

01:16:34.015 --> 01:16:35.236
Where is Doug?

01:16:36.005 --> 01:16:37.592
He'll be back in a little while.

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:39.431
Okay.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:52.308
Are you hungry?

01:16:58.244 --> 01:16:58.911
Yeah.

01:17:00.995 --> 01:17:03.840
I got off early tonight.
Business sucks.

01:17:09.211 --> 01:17:12.163
Want to go around the
corner and get a pow boy?

01:17:12.548 --> 01:17:14.403
- What's a 'pow boy'?

01:17:14.523 --> 01:17:16.082
- It's like a sandwich.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:19.260
All right.

01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:27.623
I figured he was married.

01:17:28.824 --> 01:17:29.815
Did you?

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.931
He doesn't like being alone, you know.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:36.710
I know.

01:17:42.179 --> 01:17:43.793
Hey, you know...me and Doug

01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:49.056
like we don't fool around
or anything like that.

01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:53.054
- I'm just sayin. I mean like..
Nothing like that. - I believe you.

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:57.993
- 'Cause like he's completely old
school, it's crazy. - I believe you.

01:17:58.113 --> 01:18:01.716
He even like fines me a
dollar if I say the word 'fuck'.

01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:08.887
- Could you not tell him that too, cause
I think that he'd.. - ...fine you a dollar.

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:11.076
- Yeah.

01:18:11.714 --> 01:18:13.085
I won't tell him.

01:18:22.351 --> 01:18:24.060
How long you guys been married?

01:18:25.281 --> 01:18:27.253
Thirty years next June.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:34.108
That's basically forever.

01:18:39.986 --> 01:18:41.181
You got any kids?

01:18:43.951 --> 01:18:45.575
We had a daughter...

01:18:47.628 --> 01:18:49.553
She died in a car accident.

01:18:52.526 --> 01:18:54.770
My mom died in a car accident.

01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:58.316
I was in the car accident as well.

01:18:59.837 --> 01:19:01.395
How old were you?

01:19:02.513 --> 01:19:04.996
Four or five.
I don't really....

01:19:05.287 --> 01:19:06.648
I mean, I don't remember it.

01:19:08.902 --> 01:19:09.775
Which is good.

01:19:10.759 --> 01:19:12.205
It' d be kind of fucked
up to remember that.

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:18.480
- What was your daughter's name?
- Emily.

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:21.933
Emily Eugenia Riley.

01:19:24.036 --> 01:19:25.484
How old was she?

01:19:25.775 --> 01:19:26.902
Fifteen.

01:19:29.118 --> 01:19:30.247
That sucks.

01:19:32.322 --> 01:19:33.017
Yes.

01:19:35.449 --> 01:19:36.379
It does.

01:20:13.469 --> 01:20:14.652
Night out.

01:20:22.148 --> 01:20:24.289
It's so unusual to be outside.

01:20:26.176 --> 01:20:27.493
Yeah, I'll bet.

01:20:31.587 --> 01:20:33.136
I had dinner with Alison.

01:20:36.814 --> 01:20:37.743
You did?

01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:42.035
- Is she home?
- Out on a date.

01:20:56.125 --> 01:20:56.923
Come in.

01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:09.394
Did you bring your migraine medicine?

01:21:11.187 --> 01:21:12.332
No, why?

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.018
Because you need to
take one of those pills

01:21:15.138 --> 01:21:17.734
before we make love or your
going to get a headache.

01:21:19.152 --> 01:21:21.631
I haven't had a headache
in a long time.

01:21:22.882 --> 01:21:23.690
I know.

01:21:28.857 --> 01:21:30.388
We haven't made love

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:33.937
in a long time.

01:22:48.483 --> 01:22:50.633
Alison, can I came in?

01:22:52.107 --> 01:22:52.774
Yeah.

01:22:55.168 --> 01:22:56.642
Sweety, what's wrong?

01:23:00.066 --> 01:23:01.193
I don't know...

01:23:02.282 --> 01:23:03.259
there's something...

01:23:03.944 --> 01:23:06.019
there is something really
wrong with my cooter.

01:23:06.484 --> 01:23:07.986
Your "cooter"?

01:23:08.822 --> 01:23:09.977
My pussy.

01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:12.565
Did you pee?

01:23:14.377 --> 01:23:15.757
- Does it burn when you pee?
- Yes.

01:23:19.658 --> 01:23:21.245
I'll gonna get something.

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:24.083
Doug? Honey

01:23:24.947 --> 01:23:26.046
Wake up.

01:23:27.398 --> 01:23:28.186
Doug?

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.912
I need you to go to the drug store.

01:23:32.451 --> 01:23:35.374
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. It's Allison.

01:23:36.528 --> 01:23:37.796
What's wrong with her?

01:23:38.519 --> 01:23:40.409
Just female trouble.
Come on, get up.

01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:44.014
Let's get you in the shower.

01:24:00.825 --> 01:24:01.792
It's just me.

01:24:03.548 --> 01:24:04.412
Come on out.

01:24:05.511 --> 01:24:06.825
Let's get you dried off.

01:24:08.812 --> 01:24:09.695
Come here.

01:24:11.948 --> 01:24:12.842
Come on.

01:24:13.565 --> 01:24:14.504
That's it.

01:24:15.058 --> 01:24:16.148
Sit down.

01:24:20.129 --> 01:24:23.040
Do you have a pair of clean,
white cotton undies?

01:24:25.011 --> 01:24:25.716
No.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.734
Then you don't need to wear any.

01:24:30.448 --> 01:24:31.528
Oh, God...

01:24:33.033 --> 01:24:35.061
We'll just put you in
a clean nightgown.

01:24:36.187 --> 01:24:37.380
I don't have a nightgown.

01:24:38.199 --> 01:24:39.805
You can borrow one of mine.

01:24:51.075 --> 01:24:52.023
Excuse me!

01:24:53.009 --> 01:24:55.056
Excuse me, ma'am, your
daughter want's you.

01:24:55.687 --> 01:24:56.185
What?

01:24:56.305 --> 01:24:58.392
In the dressing room back there,
your daughter needs you.

01:24:59.631 --> 01:25:00.603
Oh, thank you.

01:25:01.984 --> 01:25:03.373
Thank you very much.

01:25:09.018 --> 01:25:10.764
- Alison?
- Yeah, I'm in here.

01:25:20.462 --> 01:25:21.908
This is so not jaydee.

01:25:22.237 --> 01:25:23.467
It fits well.

01:25:23.587 --> 01:25:24.941
Only need to

01:25:25.061 --> 01:25:27.232
adjust these straps.

01:25:31.853 --> 01:25:33.027
Here you go.

01:25:34.153 --> 01:25:36.388
Bet you were a good mom.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.323
That was stupid..

01:25:50.565 --> 01:25:52.692
No, no sweety, I just...

01:25:53.441 --> 01:25:56.712
- Think of things sometimes...
- What things?

01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:02.750
I went after her.

01:26:03.982 --> 01:26:05.772
I didn't tell that part.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:08.853
About how Emily died.

01:26:15.121 --> 01:26:16.309
Tell me what?

01:26:18.671 --> 01:26:20.329
I was awake that night.

01:26:22.017 --> 01:26:24.046
Doug was at his poker game...

01:26:24.515 --> 01:26:26.965
and I always stay up until he get's home.

01:26:28.652 --> 01:26:31.073
I heard something.
Went to the window.

01:26:31.469 --> 01:26:34.244
Saw Emily get into her boyfriends car.

01:26:37.032 --> 01:26:38.308
So I...

01:26:39.276 --> 01:26:42.842
put on some clothes and...
got into my car

01:26:43.285 --> 01:26:45.104
and went looking for them.

01:26:46.028 --> 01:26:47.965
- Did you find them?
- Yes.

01:26:48.405 --> 01:26:51.413
Parked in a shopping center,
not far from our house.

01:26:51.869 --> 01:26:54.378
I'm sure they were
really happy to see you.

01:26:55.258 --> 01:26:56.946
They took off

01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:59.836
I tried to catch up

01:27:00.485 --> 01:27:01.746
but I couldn't.

01:27:02.113 --> 01:27:04.211
He was driving so fast.

01:27:05.575 --> 01:27:07.942
Lost them for a little while until...

01:27:15.937 --> 01:27:17.439
They crashed the car.

01:27:19.435 --> 01:27:22.897
Ran a stop sign and
hit a truck..

01:27:23.675 --> 01:27:26.359
By the time I got there
everything was on fire.

01:27:27.064 --> 01:27:28.736
I couldn't get to them.

01:27:31.744 --> 01:27:34.561
It wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't gone after her.

01:27:40.652 --> 01:27:42.897
You get changed and go meet Doug.

01:27:49.997 --> 01:27:51.197
Hey.

01:27:54.184 --> 01:27:56.282
It's not your fault.
That's not your fault.

01:27:58.073 --> 01:28:00.127
It's just like..
I mean, my mom

01:28:00.479 --> 01:28:03.325
getting in a car accident,
it's not my fault.

01:28:10.048 --> 01:28:12.669
Your mother must have been very pretty.

01:28:15.765 --> 01:28:16.513
Yeah.

01:28:19.976 --> 01:28:22.162
She had bigger tits than me.

01:28:22.479 --> 01:28:25.205
I have dads tits, I don't
know what happened.

01:28:25.325 --> 01:28:27.995
I got my dads too.

01:28:30.697 --> 01:28:32.399
See you back there.

01:28:53.401 --> 01:28:55.485
I said, get white ones, but..

01:28:58.008 --> 01:28:59.578
She likes them.

01:29:07.417 --> 01:29:08.943
- Watch out!
- Sorry!

01:29:12.288 --> 01:29:15.002
Can I take a shower yet?
- Nope.

01:29:15.959 --> 01:29:18.688
There are a couple of more ...
keeps going out.

01:29:23.251 --> 01:29:25.688
- Why did you dump Lois?
- Goddamit!

01:29:27.874 --> 01:29:29.503
I didn't dump her.

01:29:30.192 --> 01:29:31.879
You been living here with me.
What's up with that?

01:29:32.265 --> 01:29:33.380
I don't know.

01:29:33.908 --> 01:29:35.449
You think it's all her fault?

01:29:37.503 --> 01:29:38.662
- What?

01:29:40.437 --> 01:29:42.227
Your daughter and the car crash.

01:29:44.828 --> 01:29:46.295
She told you about that?

01:29:46.633 --> 01:29:47.352
Yeah.

01:29:48.173 --> 01:29:50.066
It's not like a secret or something?

01:29:51.342 --> 01:29:52.853
Give me my lighter back.

01:29:54.210 --> 01:29:57.073
Because it would really suck
shit if you blamed her for that.

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:02.171
I don't blame her.
What are you talking about?

01:30:02.650 --> 01:30:05.389
- I mean, she was being a good mom.
- Who said she wasn't?

01:30:07.530 --> 01:30:10.027
So don't think it's all her fault, then?
- No.

01:30:10.434 --> 01:30:13.129
I don't know. We don't talk about it.
Give me my lighter back.

01:30:16.655 --> 01:30:18.064
You should talk about it.

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:42.677
- Hey, 'll see you later.
- Where are you going? - The club.

01:30:44.324 --> 01:30:47.724
Don't you think you should take
a few nights off until your...

01:30:48.334 --> 01:30:51.305
you know. - I got my cranberry juice.
I'm good to go.

01:30:59.393 --> 01:31:02.332
Allison, I don't think you
should do this anymore.

01:31:07.327 --> 01:31:10.078
- Do what?
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:12.679
You don't work, you don't eat.

01:31:15.318 --> 01:31:16.172
Wait.

01:31:18.619 --> 01:31:21.961
I can't let you do this.
- Lois, don't. - What?

01:31:22.159 --> 01:31:23.220
Don't be stupid.

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:25.807
I apologize for being so unsophisicated

01:31:25.927 --> 01:31:30.079
but I can not let a 16-year
girl prostitute herself.

01:31:30.199 --> 01:31:32.878
- I'm fucking dancer.
- And a prostitute!

01:31:34.466 --> 01:31:38.175
Well, you are not my fuckin mom.
So get the fuck out of my way!

01:31:38.403 --> 01:31:41.060
- Alison! - Don't fuckin touch me!
- All right.

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.927
Listen to me, though.
Please, listen to me.

01:31:43.047 --> 01:31:45.106
- I don't have to listen to you!
- Hey, what's going on?

01:31:45.226 --> 01:31:46.139
You're not my fuckin mom!

01:31:46.259 --> 01:31:48.909
I don't listen to people!
This is my fucking house!

01:31:49.029 --> 01:31:52.866
- Just get the fuck out of my house. - No!
You don't know what your doing to yourself, sweetheart.

01:31:52.986 --> 01:31:55.614
- Oh yeah. I don't know what I'm doing?
- Don't. - Please, Doug.

01:31:55.734 --> 01:31:59.125
And I know more about what
I do, then you'll ever know.

01:31:59.245 --> 01:32:01.229
- How many cocks you swallow?
- Hey!

01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:05.188
- Fuck! Fuck!
- All right, come on!

01:32:05.308 --> 01:32:08.364
- My fuckin.. - She didn't mean it!
- Fuck you!

01:32:08.796 --> 01:32:11.547
- Calm down!
- Stop fucking touching me!

01:32:11.667 --> 01:32:14.202
- She didn't mean it, all right?
- Get the fuck off me!

01:32:14.322 --> 01:32:17.179
- Please, I'm sorry! Alison, Allison!

01:32:18.353 --> 01:32:21.828
- Let her go, Doug! Doug, let her go!
- I just want to talk to her!

01:32:21.948 --> 01:32:23.640
- Mallory!
- Doug!

01:32:24.259 --> 01:32:25.349
Let her go.

01:32:57.146 --> 01:32:59.456
There is a train to Chicago in the morning.

01:33:00.035 --> 01:33:02.458
I will take the bus from
there to Indianapolis.

01:33:28.596 --> 01:33:29.807
We're out of beer.

01:33:30.512 --> 01:33:32.474
I'll be back in a little while.

01:34:33.195 --> 01:34:33.899
Hello?

01:34:36.434 --> 01:34:37.310
What?

01:34:41.291 --> 01:34:42.277
Where are you?

01:34:45.429 --> 01:34:46.782
I'll be right there.

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:49.617
What name are you under?

01:34:51.566 --> 01:34:52.289
What?

01:34:52.504 --> 01:34:54.137
<i>Mallory.
- All right, all right.</i>

01:35:09.045 --> 01:35:10.145
Sit down.

01:35:11.967 --> 01:35:14.230
- Do you want to know what she did?
- Yeah.

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:18.361
She had an altercation with
an unsatisfied customer. He..

01:35:19.155 --> 01:35:22.884
He's droped the charges
and they've shaved down

01:35:23.004 --> 01:35:27.047
the resisting arrest to desordarly
conduct so everybody get's off cheap.

01:35:34.585 --> 01:35:37.890
Here's your receipt and my card.
You're free to go.

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:42.254
Thank you.

01:35:42.508 --> 01:35:43.907
You're welcome. Thank you.

01:37:26.705 --> 01:37:28.421
- Goddamnit.

01:37:29.404 --> 01:37:31.957
Where are you going? Where you going?

01:37:33.132 --> 01:37:35.113
- Get back in the car!
- Doug!

01:37:35.656 --> 01:37:38.374
Goddamnit. What are you doing?

01:37:42.084 --> 01:37:44.328
I'm nobodys little girl.

01:37:46.164 --> 01:37:48.071
It's too late for that shit.

01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:09.265
She's not Emily.

01:38:17.557 --> 01:38:18.789
I know that.

01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:19.478
- You leaving?
- Yeah. You..

01:39:23.323 --> 01:39:24.937
You seen Mallory?

01:39:25.505 --> 01:39:28.054
No, I haven't seen her.

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:32.535
- She got arrested last night. - I know.
I was there. We got raided.

01:39:32.846 --> 01:39:37.477
- They shut us down.
- I bailed her out but..she ran off.

01:39:39.018 --> 01:39:41.493
I haven't seen her.
I don't know where she went.

01:39:51.559 --> 01:39:54.182
Give this to her for me.

01:39:57.684 --> 01:39:58.689
All right.

01:40:02.156 --> 01:40:03.476
Tell her...

01:40:10.898 --> 01:40:12.695
She's got my number.

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:14.621
Okay.

01:40:16.794 --> 01:40:18.628
- You take care.
- You too.

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:41.396
Tara?

01:42:49.804 --> 01:42:50.537
Hello?

01:42:52.683 --> 01:42:53.545
Hey.

01:42:57.238 --> 01:42:58.357
Where are you?

01:42:58.962 --> 01:42:59.998
Houston.

01:43:01.998 --> 01:43:04.599
- I'm heading to Vegas.
- Are you okay?

01:43:06.038 --> 01:43:08.029
Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't sweat it.

01:43:08.545 --> 01:43:10.398
Well I do sweat.
Can't help it.

01:43:11.487 --> 01:43:14.379
- It's been two weeks. - Yeah, I know.
I was gonna call, I just...

01:43:19.099 --> 01:43:21.599
Thanks for the cash that you left me.

01:43:22.453 --> 01:43:25.083
And the bag too, lt's really
getting a lot of use.

01:43:26.134 --> 01:43:27.124
You're welcome.

01:43:30.063 --> 01:43:31.650
We're here, you know.

01:43:32.054 --> 01:43:33.434
Anytime.

01:43:34.991 --> 01:43:37.094
Will you tell Lois, I'm sorry?

01:43:37.329 --> 01:43:38.286
For what?

01:43:39.037 --> 01:43:41.013
Well, you know...

01:43:41.962 --> 01:43:44.131
for getting all up in
her face like that...

01:43:45.555 --> 01:43:47.301
All right, I will.

01:43:48.090 --> 01:43:49.740
And don't be mad at me.

01:43:50.988 --> 01:43:53.336
I'm not mad at you.
Not at all.

01:43:54.650 --> 01:43:55.852
I miss you,

01:43:56.552 --> 01:43:59.097
if that means anything to you.

01:44:01.356 --> 01:44:02.792
I miss you too.

01:44:05.746 --> 01:44:10.027
So Lois is gonna mind if I call
you every once in a while, right?

01:44:10.469 --> 01:44:11.809
No, no.

01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:13.554
Absolutely not.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.826
Lois wouldn't mind
hearing from you either.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.144
If ever you need...

01:44:19.907 --> 01:44:22.812
female advice or whatever.

01:44:23.148 --> 01:44:27.329
She thinks your smart.
Too smart, to be doing what you're doing.

01:44:38.941 --> 01:44:39.865
Okay.

01:44:40.819 --> 01:44:42.374
I gotta go.

01:44:43.826 --> 01:44:46.232
- My bus is leaving.
- All right.

01:44:48.418 --> 01:44:51.327
- Try to stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:54.466
- I quit smoking.
- Really?

01:44:55.552 --> 01:44:57.019
Good for you!

01:44:57.943 --> 01:44:59.748
- Me too.
- Really?

01:45:01.688 --> 01:45:04.490
- Welll, maybe there is some hope for us?
- Maybe so.

01:45:05.986 --> 01:45:07.101
Maybe so.

01:45:08.436 --> 01:45:09.920
You never know.

01:45:10.331 --> 01:45:11.827
You never know.

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.822
You never do.

01:45:16.289 --> 01:45:16.949
Right.

01:45:17.903 --> 01:45:19.386
Bye, Doug.

01:45:19.650 --> 01:45:21.367
Goodbye, Allison.
