WEBVTT

01:08.500 --> 01:10.541
I knew it was a mistake trusting you.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.625
You've been a real picnic yourself.

01:12.708 --> 01:16.833
I'm not the one who walked us
into, not one, but two of Silco's traps.

01:16.916 --> 01:19.291
-This isn't Silco, it's someone else.

01:19.375 --> 01:20.666
How do you know?

01:20.750 --> 01:22.083
'Cause we'd already be dead.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.333
Oh, very nice.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.208
When were you planning to tell me
that your lunatic sister works for him?

01:26.291 --> 01:27.625
Just as soon as you came clean about

01:27.708 --> 01:28.958
what the hell
you're really doing down here.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.875
-I told you the truth.
-Bullshit.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.250
What was that glowing stone?

01:34.375 --> 01:35.458
That's what I thought.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.166
What's going on?

01:40.250 --> 01:42.916
-Hey, stop! Get your hands off of me!
-Leave her alone!

01:43.000 --> 01:44.416
-Let me go!
-Vi?

01:45.500 --> 01:46.583
Vi!

01:47.208 --> 01:49.666
Vi!

02:06.875 --> 02:08.166
Hey.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.541
You shy? Or just ugly?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.875
You look good for a dead girl.

03:03.333 --> 03:06.333


03:06.416 --> 03:11.833


03:48.750 --> 03:49.583
Ekko?

03:53.041 --> 03:54.458
What do you know about this?

03:56.833 --> 03:59.541
Nothing. What the hell is this all about?

03:59.625 --> 04:02.208
What were you doing with Jinx?

04:02.291 --> 04:03.541
Her name is Powder.

04:03.625 --> 04:06.291
And I just found her
when you and your goons showed up.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
It's me. Vi.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.208
Same person who used to take you down
to the junk heap

04:11.291 --> 04:13.375
and hose you down
when you got covered in grease.

04:15.166 --> 04:16.666
That was a long time ago.

04:17.666 --> 04:18.708
People change.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.708
Yeah. I'm getting that.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.750
Are you working for Silco?

04:25.291 --> 04:26.583
Fuck. You.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.208
I thought you were dead.

04:28.291 --> 04:31.041
Now you show up with a Piltie
and give her a tour of the Lanes?

04:31.125 --> 04:33.916
You were following us?
Why didn't you say something?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.416
I didn't know if I could trust you.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.541
So… so you just come out swinging?

04:39.125 --> 04:40.916
Gee, I wonder who I learned that from?

04:41.000 --> 04:44.125
Ah, well, you shoulda learned more.
You still punch like a little boy.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.250
And you still block with your face.

04:48.958 --> 04:51.291
I remember when
you wouldn't stand up to me.

04:54.708 --> 04:56.375
I missed you, little man.

04:58.791 --> 05:00.583
How long have you had those off?

05:01.208 --> 05:02.791
How long have you been whining?

05:09.541 --> 05:11.250
Hmm. Fascinating.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.916
I would very much like to see the device.

05:18.416 --> 05:20.458
This, uh, Hexcore.

05:21.041 --> 05:24.458
That may be difficult to arrange.

05:26.125 --> 05:30.958
I've tried every combination of runes,
but… it's always the same.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.166
The subject, wither and rot.

05:35.250 --> 05:39.208
Uh, perhaps the error resides
not with your calculations but…

05:39.791 --> 05:41.541
with your subjects.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.083
Nature has made us intolerant to change,

05:44.166 --> 05:49.250
but fortunately,
we have the capacity to change our nature.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.708
-And this is… Shimmer?
-A variant.

05:53.208 --> 05:57.375
It should provide everything one needs
to survive a violent transition.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.458
Will it work on plants?

05:59.541 --> 06:02.291
You aren't here about the plants, are you?

06:03.208 --> 06:05.625
I know the look of a doomed man.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.291
I must warn you.

06:09.291 --> 06:12.250
If you take this path,
they will despise you.

06:13.125 --> 06:18.000
Love and legacy are
the sacrifices we make for progress.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.708
It's why I parted ways with Heimerdinger.

06:26.416 --> 06:29.166
-Jayce will understand.
-Perhaps.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.166
Hammer work is such a delicate art.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.458
How'd you find me?

07:07.541 --> 07:11.125
You're the de facto head of the Council.
People notice where you go.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.083
Huh. Don't remind me.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.750
This border shutdown
has people agitated.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.083
They should be.

07:19.083 --> 07:22.541
Marcus brought this to me.
It's an explosive.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.583
I tried taking it apart
and it nearly killed me.

07:24.666 --> 07:26.583
Whoever built it
knows exactly what they're doing.

07:27.375 --> 07:31.125
This and Shimmer. It's hard to believe
what they're capable of.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.666
Is that what's really bothering you?

07:40.041 --> 07:43.625
He was my mentor, Mel. And I betrayed him.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.500
Everything you said about him was true.

07:49.250 --> 07:52.750
My family cast me out
and yet, part of me still loves them.

07:53.958 --> 07:56.208
Heimerdinger will understand eventually.

07:57.083 --> 08:00.416
It's your time now, Jayce.
No more red tape.

08:00.500 --> 08:04.250
You can bring Hextech to the masses,
just like you've always dreamed.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.625
Hmm. First, I have to save Viktor.

08:09.708 --> 08:10.708
Where is he?

08:11.333 --> 08:12.500
I don't know.

08:13.208 --> 08:15.458
He disappeared.
He does that sometimes.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.541
-No sign of Caitlyn either.
-The Kiramman girl?

08:18.625 --> 08:20.958
It's just…

08:21.041 --> 08:24.875
-Uh, never mind.
-Hey. We'll get through this.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.333
I'll stall the Council
but they'll soon need their leader.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.083
In the meantime…

08:32.333 --> 08:34.083
Try not to lose your nuts.

08:46.458 --> 08:50.833
All our business is down. Enforcers are
searching anyone who crosses the bridge.

08:51.583 --> 08:55.833
Marcus is following my orders.
Preventing Vi and Caitlyn from returning.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.458
Or he's finally flipped.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.416
Hmm.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.166
The chembarons scheduled an assembly.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.750
Oh.

09:08.541 --> 09:12.375
-I've had enough headaches.
-It didn't sound like a request.

09:16.666 --> 09:18.958
-Where are you going?

09:19.041 --> 09:20.208
I need to find Jinx.

09:20.291 --> 09:21.583
-Sir.
-What?

09:22.291 --> 09:25.166
I got more in common
with cave lice than Jinx.

09:26.291 --> 09:31.583
But let's just say I didn't always see
eye-to-eye with my old man.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.041
And?

09:35.416 --> 09:38.291
She'll come to you when she's ready.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.583
Hmm.

09:57.833 --> 10:00.125
-<i>You lost her.</i>

10:00.708 --> 10:03.750
I didn't lose her! They took her.

10:03.833 --> 10:07.041
<i>She cares about
that enforcer, you saw it.</i>

10:08.791 --> 10:12.041
She was there for me! Not the enforcer.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.750
<i>Remember her name?</i>

10:13.833 --> 10:16.333
Why would I remember her name?

10:18.416 --> 10:20.458
Well, she's just some stupid topsider!

10:34.500 --> 10:35.333
Caitlyn.

10:56.916 --> 10:57.750
Pow.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.333
Come on. Go!

11:08.500 --> 11:09.666
I got it.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.333
Whoo-hoo!

11:12.000 --> 11:13.625
Is that real tree?

11:13.708 --> 11:14.958
Pretty cool, huh?

11:15.041 --> 11:17.541
When I first saw it,
I knew this was the place.

11:18.041 --> 11:21.125
If a single seed could make it down here,
so could we.

11:21.916 --> 11:23.208
You built all this?

11:23.708 --> 11:24.750
Not alone.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.916
-After Vander…

11:28.416 --> 11:29.291
…died,

11:29.875 --> 11:31.958
Silco flooded the lanes with Shimmer.

11:32.666 --> 11:34.500
He didn't care
what it did to people.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.041
Everyone here was an addict or a victim.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.333
Hi.

11:39.416 --> 11:41.208
They needed
somewhere safe to start again.

11:44.083 --> 11:47.666
I should have been there.
For you. For everyone.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.250
That's a good way to drive yourself crazy.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.458
If I just went with you that day,
maybe none of this would have happened.

11:55.958 --> 11:59.791
Or maybe you'd be dead. Or… changed.

12:00.291 --> 12:01.666
Powder's gone, Vi.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.708
All that's left is Jinx
and she belongs to Silco.

12:03.791 --> 12:07.291
You're wrong. She's still in there.
I can reach her.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.416
You can't.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.833
I know my sister.

12:16.291 --> 12:17.875
I got one more thing to show you.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.875
This is everyone we've lost.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.541
The price of our freedom.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.833
Some of it was Enforcers.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.000
Most was Silco.

12:42.875 --> 12:47.083
Your sister works for him not because
she has to, but because she wants to.

12:47.791 --> 12:49.666
I'm sorry, but that's who she is now.

13:04.708 --> 13:05.875
Get down!

13:05.958 --> 13:07.166
-Let us through!
-Come on!

13:16.375 --> 13:17.625
We understand.

13:17.708 --> 13:18.958
Just stand down!

13:20.166 --> 13:23.208
-Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff.
-Not a problem, Councilor.

13:24.708 --> 13:26.416
Jayce, what is this?

13:28.583 --> 13:30.541
Do you have any idea how this looks?

13:30.625 --> 13:33.125
I order a blockade
and my own partner violates it?

13:34.708 --> 13:37.541
You ordered this? Why?

13:37.625 --> 13:40.708
There are people down there
who seem hell-bent on destroying us.

13:40.791 --> 13:41.875
What were you doing?

13:42.583 --> 13:45.250
I was consulting a friend
about our quandary.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.041
I told you, I knew someone.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.208
Well, you didn't say
they were from the undercity.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.958
What difference does that make?

13:51.041 --> 13:53.250
What diff… They're dangerous.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.083
I'm from the undercity.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.791
You're right.

13:59.208 --> 14:00.333
I'm sorry.

14:00.416 --> 14:01.625
I've had a lot on my plate.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.000
Was your friend able to help?

14:05.541 --> 14:06.625
No.

14:06.708 --> 14:10.625
No, he said, "Nature was resistant
to this sort of tampering."

14:11.333 --> 14:13.041
All right, we'll keep at it.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.958
First, this wild attack
in the heart of Piltover.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.958
Now, the border's closing.

14:40.666 --> 14:43.208
We're bleeding money and for what?

14:43.291 --> 14:48.083
His dreams of rebellion?
He's losing control.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.416
If we stand together…

14:50.250 --> 14:52.416
We aren't due for an assembly.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.541
We should be.

14:58.625 --> 15:02.583
Ever since your stunt topside,
profits have been plummeting.

15:02.666 --> 15:05.625
He's right.
Merchandise is frozen at the border.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.833
Topsiders are too afraid to cross.

15:07.916 --> 15:11.791
We're all wondering,
what's your plan to fix this?

15:13.833 --> 15:16.333
You're all wondering, are you?

15:18.916 --> 15:22.500
Way I see it, we should cut a deal
and give back the Gemstone.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.750
Better to have some trade
than none at all.

15:27.750 --> 15:31.083
The border issue is temporary.
Jinx will deal with it.

15:31.166 --> 15:32.958
Huh.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.041
Rumor is, your dog's off her leash.

15:36.750 --> 15:41.958
How you meant to bring Piltover to heel
if you can't handle your own people, huh?

15:54.375 --> 15:55.583
What's that?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.583
Oh, you don't recognize it?

16:03.875 --> 16:05.875
Have you forgotten
where we came from?

16:07.083 --> 16:08.541
The mines they had us in?

16:10.958 --> 16:14.208
-Air so thick it clogged your throat.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.791
-Stuck in your eyes.

16:18.791 --> 16:21.000
But I pulled you all up
from the depths.

16:21.083 --> 16:24.500
-Offered you a taste of topside.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.791
And fresh air.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.666
I gave you life.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.500
Purpose.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.916
But you've grown fat and complacent.

16:42.666 --> 16:44.958
Too much time in the sun.

16:55.833 --> 17:00.833
We came from a world where there
was never enough to go around, Finn.

17:04.416 --> 17:06.000
That is why we fight.

17:06.666 --> 17:07.791
Do you remember?

17:10.083 --> 17:13.958
Sorry. Please.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.333
Please.

17:24.583 --> 17:25.833
Don't forget again.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.375
Good meeting.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.958
I've had word from
our friends overseas.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.250
This threat from the undercity
is drawing attention.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.375
Piltover looks vulnerable.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.500
It's too soon. Jayce isn't ready.

18:23.666 --> 18:25.625
There's one other thing.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.625
This arrived for you.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.041
-Hmm?

19:07.250 --> 19:08.791
What have you done with Vi?

19:12.333 --> 19:16.750
Listen, let her go. I brought her here.
It's me you want.

19:18.208 --> 19:20.000
-My hero.
-You're…

19:20.666 --> 19:23.875
But I thought you…
I thought they were hurting you!

19:24.958 --> 19:26.833
Vi tells me I can trust you.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.125
You get
a pass back topside, that's it.

19:30.208 --> 19:31.291
Let's go.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.541
Let me help you with that.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.750
Where've you been, Jinx?

19:48.750 --> 19:54.541
Oh, you know.
Here, there, chasing down dead ends.

19:54.625 --> 19:58.916
And guess what? They're not all dead.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.333
I can explain.

20:01.208 --> 20:04.750
-Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.

20:05.583 --> 20:09.875
I didn't know. Marcus never told me
she was in Stillwater.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.791
-But you found out she came back.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.458
-You lied.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.708
-I wanted to protect you.
-From what?

20:19.791 --> 20:25.000
She and the enforcer are back
for the crystal. Not for you.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.875
-Have you forgotten how she left you?

20:29.458 --> 20:33.625
Who found you? Who cared for you?
Gave you a home?

20:34.125 --> 20:39.083
I am your family.
Everyone else betrays us.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.041
-I need you.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.916
-Now more than ever.

20:49.375 --> 20:51.333
You have to complete the weapon.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.250
It's beautiful.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.583
If your people had your way,
it'd be rubble and ash.

21:19.833 --> 21:21.291
It's a misunderstanding.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.666
They think you work for Silco.

21:23.750 --> 21:28.750
Your people hunt us like animals.
Silco pays them to do it.

21:29.625 --> 21:32.041
That's not possible. You're wrong.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.250
Say that one more time.

21:34.333 --> 21:37.750
Ekko, she believes what she's saying,
okay? She's not your enemy.

21:37.833 --> 21:40.000
Oh, yeah? Then what's this?

21:42.166 --> 21:45.333
You got it.
You have to let me take that back.

21:46.375 --> 21:48.750
-
-What is it?

21:48.833 --> 21:50.041
It's a Gemstone.

21:50.541 --> 21:53.666
It was stolen during the attack.
By your sister.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.958
You just forgot to mention that?

21:56.541 --> 21:59.375
With this, someone
with the right knowledge could build…

21:59.875 --> 22:01.750
any Hextech device.

22:02.958 --> 22:07.291
If enforcers are becoming
more… aggressive, that's why.

22:08.791 --> 22:10.750
We could beat Silco with this.

22:11.333 --> 22:12.833
That won't solve things.

22:12.916 --> 22:16.583
Easy for you to say. Your people
aren't dying all around you.

22:18.208 --> 22:21.000
Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.500
You'd be well
within your rights to keep it.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.416
I couldn't blame you.

22:28.083 --> 22:30.208
But… if you do,

22:30.291 --> 22:32.625
this cycle of violence will never stop.

22:34.208 --> 22:37.000
This is our best shot
at setting the record straight.

22:37.708 --> 22:39.291
This city needs healing.

22:40.041 --> 22:41.791
More than I ever realized.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.791
Please, let me help you.

22:47.958 --> 22:48.875
You got a plan?

22:49.833 --> 22:51.500
I have a friend on the council.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.000
Let me take the Gemstone to him.

22:55.958 --> 22:59.000
He'll listen to me.
Your people wouldn't have to hide anymore.

23:01.333 --> 23:04.208
One condition.
I'm the one who gives it to them.

23:08.250 --> 23:11.125
Um, the form is crude, but…

23:11.791 --> 23:14.833
uh, the engineering is… inspired.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.416
You think they could crack Hextech?

23:17.458 --> 23:19.708
Mm. It's a leap.

23:19.791 --> 23:24.125
It's been suggested that they may
have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.

23:24.625 --> 23:28.458
If we are to assume the worst, that would
mean they've turned it into a weapon.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.458
Well, do we know this for certain?

23:31.041 --> 23:32.833
We can't afford to wait to find out.

23:33.916 --> 23:36.000
Wait. What are you suggesting?

23:38.416 --> 23:40.708
We should prepare our own countermeasures.

23:41.416 --> 23:43.000
You want us to build weapons?

23:43.083 --> 23:47.041
Absolutely not.
That is not why we invented Hextech.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.625
We would shatter
any attempt at peace.

23:49.708 --> 23:52.125
-Heimerdinger would never go for this.
-Heimerdingers' inaction

23:52.208 --> 23:54.625
is what brought us here.
You said so yourself.

23:55.583 --> 23:58.875
The peace is already broken, Jayce.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.416
I'm only asking you to prepare
to defend your people.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.291
If we're lucky,
we'll never need to use it.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.208
The decision is yours.

24:19.333 --> 24:22.791
Ridiculous.
You cannot be considering this.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.833
What if she's right? Are we just
gonna stand by while they attack us?

24:26.916 --> 24:29.500
We're scientists, not soldiers.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.250
We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.666
We agreed Hextech was to improve lives…

24:34.750 --> 24:36.083
…not to take them.

24:36.166 --> 24:37.583
We may not have a choice.

24:54.291 --> 24:57.083
There is always a choice.

24:59.833 --> 25:00.833
I need to think.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.250
What are they?

25:58.791 --> 26:02.250
We call them firelights.
Never seen so many though.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.375
I'm worried I have to do something
I never thought I would.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.458
Vi?

28:08.041 --> 28:09.625
I can't leave her again.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.291
You can't change her.

28:12.875 --> 28:13.916
I have to try.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.041
Don't get yourself killed.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.041
No promises.

28:29.750 --> 28:34.125
It's been real, Cupcake.
Thanks. For everything.

28:42.208 --> 28:46.208
-Shut up. It's just a goodbye hug.

28:47.416 --> 28:50.458
She wouldn't do that. Not again.

29:15.791 --> 29:17.041
-Halt!

29:17.125 --> 29:19.291
What the hell is this?

29:22.583 --> 29:26.583
Sir! I have proof.
Silco's behind everything.

29:32.833 --> 29:33.833
Show me.

29:37.958 --> 29:38.958
No.

29:39.791 --> 29:40.625
Hmm.

29:42.583 --> 29:43.416
Shit.

29:58.208 --> 29:59.333


30:05.083 --> 30:06.083
Caitlyn!

30:15.875 --> 30:16.833
Liar.

30:18.791 --> 30:21.083
I told you to leave this alone.

32:02.791 --> 32:05.416
Tell my…

32:05.500 --> 32:07.958
Tell my daughter I…

33:17.458 --> 33:18.916
Go!

33:38.333 --> 33:43.291
Oh, look who it is. The boy savior.

34:02.875 --> 34:03.791
Hah.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.458
Yes!

35:26.750 --> 35:28.625
No.
