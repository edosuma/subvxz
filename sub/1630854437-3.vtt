00:13.947 --> 00:15.183
Mama!

00:15.183 --> 00:17.851
I'd like to bury him
at the ranch.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.653
That way we can always
visit him.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.191
I'm looking for the end
of the airport on my land.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.126
Cancel the lease!

00:25.126 --> 00:28.096
Cancelling the lease is how
they end up with your ranch.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.897
Never contradict him again.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.566
I'm trying to protect him
and the ranch.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.668
Today I'm signing
an executive order

00:34.668 --> 00:37.605
that ceases all state funding
for the Paradise Valley

00:37.605 --> 00:39.240
Development Project.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.974
That's Jamie Dutton,
the Attorney General.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.643
The son doesn't look
up to this fight.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.945
Think I'm gonna start
with him.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.115
Wolves got into pairs
in pasture nine.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.716
We got Ryan and Colby
hunting them out.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.050
What'd we do?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.785
Why'd you shoot the ones
with the collars?

00:51.785 --> 00:54.355
We gotta get these
collars off and keep moving.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.257
You don't tell a soul.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.059
That's my ranch down there.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.729
Whatever you're spraying it with
is killing my cattle.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.131
I'm licensed to spray it.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.898
Hello? Hey!

02:06.794 --> 02:08.429
Fan out wide from here.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.022
Whoa.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.007
Wolves.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.542
Tracks lead west.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.378
Got a cow and
calf down over there.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.779
Picked the calf clean.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.314
Just ate the stomach
out the mama.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.748
Can't find the rest
of the herd anywhere.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.852
You see any cattle?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.988
Not a one.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.156
Maybe it's dogs
if they're not eating 'em.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.125
Those wild dogs pack up,
they can be fierce.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.530
It ain't dogs...

03:49.530 --> 03:50.998
Don't know how they
got here so quick.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.766
Just released them
in the spring.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.335
A hundred miles from here.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.337
I don't think it's a wolf.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.376
You ever see dogs this big?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.045
I haven't.

04:12.185 --> 04:15.323
Thought they weren't
supposed to leave the park.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.759
Well, guess they didn't
bother telling the wolf that.

04:21.161 --> 04:24.031
If they did...

04:24.031 --> 04:25.333
he ain't listening.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.678
The wolves you released
ain't even the ones

04:37.678 --> 04:39.046
that used to be here.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.948
You brought them in
from fucking Canada.

04:43.351 --> 04:47.087
Genetically speaking
they are the same species.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.222
And we sought out wolves
from regions

04:49.357 --> 04:50.991
with no livestock depredation.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.493
You know why?

04:52.493 --> 04:55.663
Because there ain't no livestock
in the forests of Alberta.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.366
But, by God,
there's depredation now.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.370
We do not have
a single confirmed

05:02.370 --> 05:03.637
livestock kill by wolves.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.049
So... What did I miss?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.685
It's... It's not even
possible for the wolves

05:17.685 --> 05:19.887
to have been dispersed
to regions with livestock

05:19.887 --> 05:21.455
within this time frame.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.823
Oh, it's possible.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.428
This is just irrational panic
over the big bad wolf

05:27.428 --> 05:29.229
when there is no such thing.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.964
The big bad wolf
is a fairy tale.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.634
Well, Keith...

05:33.634 --> 05:35.669
It looks like the fairy tale
is coming true.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.482
Well, that was fun.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.986
Help yourselves.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.690
Their fear is not fact based.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.259
It's based on rumors
and media-fueled hysteria.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.429
We investigated
dozens of claims

06:01.429 --> 06:03.030
and do not have a
single verified wolf kill.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.333
I can show you
five right now.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.501
Five?

06:07.501 --> 06:09.336
- Mm-hmm.
- Where?

06:09.437 --> 06:10.804
My ranch.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.440
Do you have any proof?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.941
My word is my proof.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.275
John, I mean no disrespect,

06:15.275 --> 06:19.246
but you are not
a wildlife biologist.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.849
Name another predator
in this region that has
paw prints

06:21.849 --> 06:24.718
the size of my hands,
that brings down its prey

06:24.718 --> 06:27.921
by biting the hocks
and consumes the organs first.

06:27.921 --> 06:31.825
You can't because
there isn't one.

06:31.825 --> 06:35.162
But remember this: ranchers'
support is the reason why

06:35.162 --> 06:37.631
you were allowed to reintroduce
them in the first place.

06:37.631 --> 06:42.035
But if you can't protect us
like you promised,

06:42.035 --> 06:44.672
then they will be forced to take
matters in their own hands.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.039
They'll have no choice.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.276
Killing an endangered
species is a felony, John.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.811
I'd remind the ranchers of that.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.481
You don't know me
well enough to call me John.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.884
It's Commissioner Dutton.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.486
But if Fish
and Wildlife officers

06:58.486 --> 07:01.789
aren't on my front porch by
Friday with a checkbook, well...

07:05.826 --> 07:07.795
you're gonna get
to know me real well.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.067
Morning.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.236
You're up early.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.471
Yeah, I gotta go to Salt Lake.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.141
Mm. What's in Salt Lake?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.143
Loose ends, baby.

09:04.612 --> 09:05.613
Loose ends.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.651
I'll be back late.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.206
You're up early.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.980
Shrewd observers,
the men in my family.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.249
Yes.
I am up early.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.284
Why are you up
so early, honey?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.788
Keeping my promise to you.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.858
Why are you up so early?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.694
Reflecting.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.195
I can't...

09:57.831 --> 09:59.767
I can't reflect at
the end of the day.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.703
Evenings are for forgetting.

10:02.703 --> 10:06.373
But in the morning
I can remember...

10:07.975 --> 10:09.376
Remember what?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.145
There's some memories

10:12.145 --> 10:14.047
fathers shouldn't share
with their children.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.549
I think we're way past
that, don't you, Dad?

10:16.549 --> 10:18.786
I've think I've told you
about everything.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.888
Hell, I told you about
my first threesome.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.222
Your what?

10:24.725 --> 10:28.662
Didn't I? I thought I...
Never mind.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.799
Do you want some more coffee?

10:31.799 --> 10:33.466
God damn, Beth.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.203
Well, I'm not the one
sitting on a porch

10:36.203 --> 10:39.306
thinking about things
that I can't tell my kids.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.174
I was thinking
about your mother.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.982
What about her?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.018
She was a magnificent woman.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.054
I wish she could
have lived long enough

10:54.054 --> 10:56.656
for you to recognize that.
To know it.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.592
To know how much she loved you.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.732
That's not what
you were thinking.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.534
It's what I'm thinking
about now.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.110
I'm late.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.019
You know, Dad, you can love
a memory all you want.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.387
But it can't love you back.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.991
Find someone that you can love

11:30.991 --> 11:34.227
while you're still
young enough to do it.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.196
You know, her memory's
not going anywhere.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.936
God damn it.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.890
Teeter, please.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.227
Oh, for fuck's sake.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.829
Baby likes 'em smooth.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.130
Well, then go shave
over with baby.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.032
It ain't your fucking sink.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.701
Hey, it's your big day.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.337
How old are you now, Lloyd?

12:50.337 --> 12:51.604
Is this the big seven-oh?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.040
Big seven-oh?!

12:53.040 --> 12:55.375
Does this look like the face
of a 70 year-old man?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.077
To me, yes.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.478
Well, here is a mirror.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.413
Don't listen to a word
the assholes are saying.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.316
You just keep doing
them pushups every day

13:03.316 --> 13:05.685
and yous is gonna live
to be a hundred.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.654
I agree with Teeter,
he does look about a hundred.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.622
That ain't what
I fucking said!

13:09.622 --> 13:11.558
How long does it take y'all
to brush your fucking teeth?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.494
Do you need a towel?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.196
I need some fucking privacy.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.365
Don't be ashamed
of what God gave you.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.433
Yeah, there's no little people
in the world,

13:20.433 --> 13:21.701
just little penises.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.203
I'm going to give
you two because

13:23.203 --> 13:24.737
we're out of the big ones.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.140
Will you sumbitches just give
me some time in here by myself?

13:29.776 --> 13:32.412
Well, well, well.
Look who's back in town.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.214
Lia, congrats on the win
in Redding.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.215
Thanks, Amigo.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.350
Happy birthday, Lloyd.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.418
Hope you have a good one.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.888
If my day ends
like yours began

13:40.888 --> 13:42.890
it'll be good enough for me.

13:42.890 --> 13:43.991
Thank you.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.560
Having barrel racer
for breakfast, I see.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.634
Happy birthday, brother.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.304
Thanks, Pard.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.606
- Is he 70?
- 58, come on.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.975
- 58?
- You have cancer or something.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.644
- Must be terminal.
- Accelerated aging.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.046
I saw something
about thaton TV.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.581
Gator'll make whatever
you want for supper.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.717
- Steaks.
- Steaks it is.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.619
We're prowling pairs, let's go.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.302
I think he likes me.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.641
Of course he likes you.
You're feeding him.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.809
He thinks you're his mama.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.480
What about
when he gets older?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.682
Gonna ship him out
with the rest?

14:42.682 --> 14:45.452
No, we'll use him
to practice roping.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.421
Or babysit next year's
bottle calves.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.190
Right.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.293
Orphans don't get shipped
off around here, Carter,

14:53.293 --> 14:54.627
in case you haven't noticed.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.965
Now, when you're done
playing mama,

14:57.965 --> 15:00.467
saddle something you
think you can ride, all right?

15:00.467 --> 15:02.970
I'm going out today?

15:02.970 --> 15:04.471
If I'm gonna make
a cowboy out of you,

15:04.471 --> 15:05.973
you're going out every day.

15:30.230 --> 15:33.000
- Morning.
- Morning.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.202
Can I help you?

15:35.202 --> 15:38.505
Fished a radio collar out
of the Yellowstone River.

15:38.505 --> 15:42.042
GPS shows the animal was on
a portion of your ranch

15:42.042 --> 15:43.410
for roughly three days

15:43.410 --> 15:45.012
before returning
to the park and then

15:45.012 --> 15:46.446
ending up in the river somehow.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.016
That a fact? What kind of
animal was the collar on?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.650
A wolf.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.252
Seen any wolves around lately?

15:52.252 --> 15:56.123
I mean, they're around but
we don't see them very often.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.724
You calving?

15:57.724 --> 16:00.327
Yeah, we, uh...
we finished last month.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.029
No wolves around though.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.431
No, we keep the pairs pretty
close this time of year.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.099
You don't mind if
we head out from here,

16:06.099 --> 16:08.135
follow these wolves' path?

16:08.135 --> 16:10.737
Where'd it go into the river?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.839
- Good question.
- We haven't found the wolves.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.242
Just the collar.
- Strapped to a log.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.711
Sounds like poachers.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.913
Sure does.
Care to ride with us?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.783
Nah, I got work to do.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.053
But just leave the gates
the way you found em.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.888
That sounded like a question,
but it isn't.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.724
We have an extra horse.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.494
Nah, I got my own horse.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.263
Just give me a minute.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.071
So you want
to rest him here?

16:46.706 --> 16:49.109
This is a rental.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.078
So, the ranch.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.813
He will need a four-legged
to take him on the journey.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.583
A horse.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.086
The journey?

16:59.086 --> 17:01.154
Your son's spirit
needs a horse spirit

17:01.154 --> 17:02.822
to carry him to the other side.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.427
You want me
to kill a horse?

17:07.427 --> 17:11.364
Won't have to.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.234
God will have his horse ready
when your son's ready.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.808
You know, death
is a private thing.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.178
It's perhaps the one thing
we do alone.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.283
No matter how many are
around us, we do it alone.

17:31.984 --> 17:35.755
This ceremony is
a private thing, too.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.725
It's not for your father
or your brother and sister.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.528
It's not even for you.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.031
And it's not for grieving.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.236
It's for sending
that boy off the right way.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.972
There's plenty of time
for grieving later.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.345
Tomorrow is the fourth day.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.315
Ceremony should be tomorrow.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.658
I'm gonna get some breakfast.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.039
I need to ask a favor.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.977
Okay.

18:30.977 --> 18:35.047
It's not really
a favor, it's um...

18:37.317 --> 18:41.721
Look, I don't do this for me.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.524
I do it for my father,
and every time I do this job,

18:44.524 --> 18:45.892
something bad happens...

18:45.892 --> 18:47.727
To her. To me, to my son.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.934
My vision told me I'd have
to choose, so I'm choosing.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.937
And I don't choose this.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.839
You did a lot of good
with that badge.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.611
It's not my path.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.216
I choose them.

19:10.783 --> 19:11.884
They are my path.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.921
It's a good choice.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.956
What's the favor?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.693
I need a job.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.968
I don't know how to apply your
skill set on the rez, Kayce.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.938
I mean, tribal police
are native for a reason.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.375
If I call BIA on your behalf,

19:35.375 --> 19:37.577
then you're not policing
for my people,

19:37.577 --> 19:39.078
you're policing my people.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.816
I'd rather you keep
the job you've got.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.953
Your brother could appoint
you an investigator

19:46.953 --> 19:49.756
for the Montana Department
of Justice in this region.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.727
We haven't had a State
Investigator here in decades.

19:56.396 --> 20:01.801
If your vision told you
to choose a different path,

20:01.801 --> 20:03.970
then the right opportunity
is on the new one.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.913
You gotta let her do it.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.350
Gotta let her do it.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.418
It's our way.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.287
Let her grieve.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.696
No!

21:18.345 --> 21:19.579
You got served.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.348
Of course I did.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.215
The attorneys
are in your office.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.918
- What attorneys?
- The ones suing the state.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.790
You do realize we have a
waiting area, right over there?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.792
I didn't think you'd want
every State Assemblyman

21:32.792 --> 21:36.262
walking by them on
their way to the Assembly.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.037
No, no.
Don't get up.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.940
I think we're past the point
of pleasantries, Jamie.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.609
If you had a shred of
confidence in your suit

21:49.609 --> 21:52.545
you wouldn't be sitting in my
office the day you filed it.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.747
Would you bring me
some coffee?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.449
No, just one cup.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.290
Hmph.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.925
Yeah.
I love what you've done here.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.228
Strong wording.

22:09.228 --> 22:12.399
Demanding the judge uphold
the lease with prejudice?

22:14.967 --> 22:17.269
So now we're just making up
judicial authorities?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.141
Here's the reality
of your situation:

22:22.141 --> 22:24.477
the State granted
conditional approval based on

22:24.477 --> 22:27.747
a satisfactory environmental
report approved by the EPA,

22:27.747 --> 22:29.248
which it wasn't.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.884
The EPA can't approve
a study that isn't complete.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.421
We haven't finished building
the thing they need to study.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.255
Park Service approval,
which was denied.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.658
No, the only thing the park
rejected was aircraft

22:38.658 --> 22:40.893
below 2000 feet over land
under their jurisdiction.

22:40.893 --> 22:41.894
None of this matters, Ellis.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.796
Your zoning request was denied.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.566
The county will not
alter its regulations

22:46.566 --> 22:49.802
with regards to multi-family
homes outside city limits.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.439
The plan was to incorporate.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.340
Well, it looks like you
put the cart

22:54.441 --> 22:56.108
in front of
the horse, counselor.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.450
You promised.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.753
You fucking promised, and you
took millions in lease payments.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.855
You have no case,
and you know it.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.766
I believe the legal term for
that is battery, by the way.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.968
It was an accident.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.135
Are you alright?

23:23.135 --> 23:24.504
- I'm fine.
- I'm terribly sorry.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.838
We won't be
pressing charges.

23:32.545 --> 23:35.748
I'll go get you another cup
and we can go try this again.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.917
Thank you, I'll just get
one in a minute.

23:43.022 --> 23:46.392
I think the meeting is over.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.960
You're better than I expected.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.732
I suppose I made the same
mistake coming out here,

23:52.732 --> 23:54.867
the middle of nowhere,

23:54.867 --> 23:58.170
expecting to find attorneys
without sophistication.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.173
But you're pretty good.

24:04.511 --> 24:07.113
The suit...
It is what it is.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.015
We have no choice
but to fight.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.750
Careers will end over this

24:10.750 --> 24:14.320
if we don't present
a measure of outrage.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.188
And we are outraged.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.625
We've invested hundreds
of millions of dollars,

24:18.625 --> 24:21.060
with another billion committed
in money that we don't get back

24:21.060 --> 24:23.329
all based on promises
made by the Governor.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.931
There's a new Governor now

24:24.931 --> 24:26.533
and he didn't
make those promises.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.704
You think it's a mistake.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.139
Of course you do, though,

24:33.139 --> 24:34.974
because you're smart,
you know what's going to happen:

24:34.974 --> 24:38.210
Every development, every Costco,
every department store,

24:38.210 --> 24:40.547
every business
under construction

24:40.547 --> 24:43.415
or planning construction
will have to cease operations

24:43.550 --> 24:45.451
until every single
permit is approved,

24:45.552 --> 24:47.119
every I is dotted.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.756
Business doesn't work like that.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.891
Business moves
faster than government,

24:51.891 --> 24:53.760
and when it has to wait,

24:53.760 --> 24:56.328
it's just too expensive.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.565
Not to mention the billions
a year in tax revenue

24:58.565 --> 25:00.466
you just hurled
out the window.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.674
I understand that Washington
is issuing a moratorium

25:07.674 --> 25:09.976
on harvesting timber
on public lands.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.178
They've issued the same
on oil and gas leases.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.917
Hm. Montana doesn't
charge a sales tax.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.089
How the fuck is this state
gonna make any money?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.996
I'm not here for the lawsuit.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.098
He filed the lawsuit,
it's his fight.

25:32.098 --> 25:35.001
I'm here to find
a soft landing.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.803
For the both of us.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.806
But you don't find those
in a courtroom.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.741
But you do find
those over dinner.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.676
How busy are you tomorrow night?

25:46.846 --> 25:48.881
Have you heard of
the Deerfield Club?

25:52.919 --> 25:54.787
It's good.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.088
Seven?

26:15.141 --> 26:17.810
- Went well?
- I think so.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.784
Good job, by the way.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.819
You play outraged very well.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.521
Thank you.

27:04.691 --> 27:05.725
What'cha doin'?

27:09.495 --> 27:14.734
Oh, trying to
convince myself to be...

27:14.734 --> 27:17.069
good at a job I don't want.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.606
Telling myself to stop
being so god damn selfish

27:20.707 --> 27:26.478
and trust that what's good for
Montana is good for our family.

27:26.478 --> 27:30.817
I guess that depends on which
Montana you're talking about.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.720
And which family.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.587
You've gotten wise, son.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.957
Paid a hell
of a price for it.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.160
I'm sorry.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.397
How's Monica?

27:47.533 --> 27:48.735
Ask me something else.

27:49.736 --> 27:53.105
Okay. How's Tate?

27:53.105 --> 27:57.944
Well, Dad...
He's getting pretty wise too.

27:57.944 --> 28:00.346
Monica wants to have a funeral.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.884
Wasn't alive long
but he was alive.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.889
Doesn't want to bury him
with a bunch of strangers.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.357
She wants him here.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.125
Where she can visit.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.526
If you'll allow it.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.865
Of course I'll allow it.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.771
She wants
a traditional service.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.776
Not sure you can be there.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.944
Not sure I can be
there either.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.346
Whatever she wants,
you give it, son.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.551
You mean that?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.387
Of course I mean it.

28:45.892 --> 28:46.993
Well then...

28:50.262 --> 28:51.297
That's what
I'm gonna do.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.667
I can't serve both.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.106
I choose her
and I choose my son.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.212
The state needs you, Kayce.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.048
She needs me more.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.819
They both do.

29:15.988 --> 29:19.691
Okay.
Let's go pick a spot.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.916
Wonder who John Dutton
will appoint to replace him?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.952
Was pretty handy having
a Livestock Commissioner

29:45.952 --> 29:47.619
who was on our side.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.021
He hasn't reached out.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.459
Not called to schedule a visit.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.760
Nothing.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.528
I think he achieved
his four-year agenda

29:56.528 --> 29:58.564
when he killed
the airport project.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.599
Well, then he should resign.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.034
The state needs a leader.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.440
Chairman.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.814
His is the old way,

30:15.814 --> 30:19.018
the "hang around the fort and
see what they give us" way.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.287
He promised land you don't have,

30:21.287 --> 30:22.788
jobs you can't get

30:22.788 --> 30:26.092
and a future
that hasn't come true.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.827
Rather than bringing jobs
<i>to</i> the Reservation,

30:28.827 --> 30:32.298
he sought jobs <i>off</i>
the reservation.

30:32.298 --> 30:36.768
Sought land
off the Reservation,

30:36.768 --> 30:38.270
Who's gonna make a
living from a casino

30:38.270 --> 30:41.340
a hundred miles from your homes?

30:41.340 --> 30:42.708
Not you.

30:42.708 --> 30:47.446
The only one who will make
money with Rainwater

30:47.446 --> 30:48.747
is white people...

30:50.816 --> 30:52.451
And Rainwater himself.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.325
I'll drive around back.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.027
We want jobs,
we want jobs...

31:12.004 --> 31:13.839
Quiet today.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.707
Business tends to be slow

31:15.707 --> 31:18.844
when there's a protest
at the front door.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.180
You know he campaigns about jobs
and income while he blocks

31:21.180 --> 31:23.615
the doors that lead to
the jobs and income.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.951
I can think of no
better description

31:24.951 --> 31:27.619
of a politician than that.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.957
He doesn't have a permit to
speak in front of the casino.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.491
We can remove him.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.293
You mean we can martyr him?

31:49.175 --> 31:51.543
Club soda.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.379
But you go on and make sure.

31:53.379 --> 31:57.583
Make sure I'm breaking the law
by drinking the poison

31:57.583 --> 32:01.320
you're free to sell to
anyone who isn't Indian.

32:01.320 --> 32:07.493
Like all the other freedoms
they have that we don't:

32:07.493 --> 32:09.828
free to open a business
on their land,

32:09.828 --> 32:12.664
free to choose their doctors,
their banks.

32:12.664 --> 32:17.836
Free to live as free men.

32:17.836 --> 32:21.507
But you keep enforcing
the slave rules, Thomas.

32:23.842 --> 32:27.013
I'm going to teach
you the master rules.

32:28.914 --> 32:32.751
And that lesson will
not be pleasant.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.553
Is that what you're doing,
Angela?

32:34.553 --> 32:36.355
You're teaching me?

32:39.025 --> 32:42.494
No, Tom.
I'm removing you.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.645
Why would you plow this?

32:59.645 --> 33:01.280
To plant hay.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.881
You don't need
to plant hay out here.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.251
The best hay grass in the world
grows wild in these valleys.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.553
Well, we use an alfalfa mix
with our horses,

33:07.553 --> 33:09.821
so we gotta replant it
every five years.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.790
They held up here
during the day.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.425
Then gathered here at night...

33:13.425 --> 33:15.061
behavior consistent
with feeding.

33:15.061 --> 33:17.096
I don't see much to eat
around here.

33:22.168 --> 33:26.805
Right here.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.540
If you say so.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.708
The computer says so.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.177
Well, then it must be true.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.944
They went off that way.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.880
Over the mountain
to the river.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.415
We're going to
follow their path.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.984
Well, be my guest.
This is as far as I go.

33:39.085 --> 33:42.554
I hope you two are pretty handy
before you get to that mountain.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.524
It's killed
some damn good cowboys

33:45.524 --> 33:46.692
and you ain't good cowboys.

33:46.692 --> 33:47.959
Best of luck.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.261
Which side of the mountain
is the river on?

33:49.261 --> 33:52.531
That'd be the wrong
side for you.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.166
We could fly it
in a chopper.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.602
Now you're thinking.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.137
Yeah, I don't want
to mess with that.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.172
Let's take the chopper.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.473
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:37.143 --> 34:40.246
Mountain air suits you, Beth.

34:40.246 --> 34:43.149
This isn't mountain air, Rob.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.383
This is city air.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.418
The mountain air's
about seven hours north.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.320
There's coffee and pastries,

34:48.320 --> 34:51.657
though you guys have
a Keto look about you.

34:51.657 --> 34:55.294
We ate on the plane,
thank you.

34:55.294 --> 34:59.431
Typically when things
seem too good to be true,

34:59.431 --> 35:02.168
I reject the proposition altogether.

35:02.168 --> 35:04.403
Well, thank you
for the latitude.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.338
You have the controlling
interest in Schwartz and Meyer.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.006
- Yes.
- You are offering it for sale.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.408
Correct.

35:09.408 --> 35:12.043
And all you want is to
carve out the real estate funds?

35:12.178 --> 35:13.445
Just the real estate.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.648
You will continue managing
the real estate funds.

35:16.648 --> 35:19.318
It's a little over
28,000 acres.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.620
That's what I mean, Beth.
It's too good to be true.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.689
Schwartz and Meyer
manages 2.3 billion

35:23.689 --> 35:25.624
with an average return
of 22 percent.

35:25.624 --> 35:29.094
That's a net of 480 million.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.397
Per year,
and you're giving it away.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.865
Well, I'm keeping three
hundred million dollars'

35:33.865 --> 35:35.267
worth of real estate.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.236
I'd hardly call that
giving it away.

35:37.236 --> 35:40.105
That land will nose dive
now that M.E.'s airport

35:40.206 --> 35:41.307
has been shut down.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.574
Well, that's my problem.

35:44.776 --> 35:49.881
There is a rattlesnake
somewhere in this deal, Beth.

35:49.881 --> 35:50.949
Care to point it out?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.621
Can we have some privacy?

35:56.888 --> 35:57.889
Give us a minute?

36:19.911 --> 36:21.947
- Care for one?
- Mm-mm.

36:21.947 --> 36:25.751
Rob, I have seen you
snort cocaine

36:25.751 --> 36:27.653
off a stripper's stomach.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.990
Why not?

36:42.268 --> 36:44.270
M.E. is going to sue me.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.672
They're going to claim
they fired me for cause,

36:46.672 --> 36:48.907
and that my severance
should be nullified

36:48.907 --> 36:51.410
by me violating
their company's NDA,

36:51.410 --> 36:54.746
then they're going to sue me
for my piece in this place,

36:54.746 --> 36:57.516
saying that I negotiated
in bad faith,

36:57.516 --> 36:59.951
and therefore the ownership agreement

36:59.951 --> 37:04.290
for Schwartz and Meyer
should also be nullified.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.792
Then they're going to sue the
state for breach of contract,

37:06.792 --> 37:10.462
and seek to initiate eminent
domain in Federal court.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.498
All those things seem likely.

37:12.498 --> 37:14.065
No shit.

37:18.504 --> 37:23.108
Market Equities is your
largest competitor, right?

37:23.108 --> 37:24.410
Yes.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.648
Don't want to fuck them
over just a little bit?

37:31.650 --> 37:34.019
I want to fuck them
over a lot.

37:34.019 --> 37:38.457
I just don't want to get
fucked in the process.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.860
Well, I will place the land
in a conservation easement.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.962
Okay, since this is
the land they intended

37:43.962 --> 37:47.065
to build Terminal Two,
their development is done.

37:47.065 --> 37:50.135
No matter what a fucking
Federal judge says.

37:50.135 --> 37:52.504
They will write down
a billion in losses

37:52.504 --> 37:54.806
and twenty times
that in lost revenue

37:54.806 --> 37:56.808
over the next ten years.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.178
I still control this place,
so I can still sell it

38:00.178 --> 38:03.849
and when I do, there is not
a court in this country

38:03.849 --> 38:06.918
that can give it back.

38:06.918 --> 38:11.222
That's another two billion
off their balance sheet.

38:11.357 --> 38:15.461
And that is how CEOs get fired.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.465
There is zero risk to you.

38:19.465 --> 38:23.769
You will inherit twelve pipe
hitting investment bankers

38:23.769 --> 38:26.372
generating half a billion
in profits

38:26.372 --> 38:29.908
and forty million in your
pocket every fucking year,

38:29.908 --> 38:31.777
and it didn't cost you a dime.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.816
Where's the rattlesnake
in the deal?

38:42.854 --> 38:45.290
I am the rattlesnake.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.025
But you're not who
I'm going to bite.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.532
All right, Beth.
I'll take it to the board.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.667
You don't need
the board's approval.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.803
You're not spending any money.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.572
This is a one day only offer.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.574
Okay? I am on a clock.

39:02.574 --> 39:05.310
I may be one step ahead of
them but I am not two.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.479
Can I have my attorney
look that over?

39:07.479 --> 39:09.147
Sure, why not?

39:09.147 --> 39:11.116
Nothing fucks up a great deal
like a good attorney.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.119
You're a big boy, Rob.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.457
You can trust me on this.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.526
And you know it.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.335
You'd better watch out, Beth.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.771
They might send a hit man
after you for this.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.110
After this, the hit men
will be after them.

39:40.512 --> 39:43.148
I assume you'll be
issuing a press release.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.350
You bet your fucking
ass I am.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.788
Will you fax
over the executed

39:49.788 --> 39:52.658
conservation easement to
the Montana Land Trust, please?

39:52.658 --> 39:53.925
<i>Sure thing.</i>

39:53.925 --> 39:56.227
You don't waste time, do you?

39:56.227 --> 39:58.096
Never.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.108
Robert.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.549
It's been a fucking blast
doing business with you.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.603
What a fucking day.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.377
Hey. Where's my dad?

40:46.377 --> 40:47.846
Went back to Helena.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.219
You hungry?

40:54.219 --> 40:55.487
Too excited to eat.

40:55.487 --> 40:56.955
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.424
We need to celebrate.

40:59.424 --> 41:01.426
Yeah? What are we celebrating?

41:01.426 --> 41:04.095
I really fucked somebody over
today and it felt great.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.231
They're celebrating Lloyd's
birthday in the bunkhouse.

41:06.231 --> 41:07.699
You're not going
anywhere near the bunkhouse.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.401
A party?
That sounds perfect.

41:12.571 --> 41:13.972
You know, I have
the right dress for that.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.340
- Yeah?
- Yep.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.143
Pretty wound up.

41:19.545 --> 41:20.579
Yep. Seems like it.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.883
I feel sorry
for the other guy.

41:24.883 --> 41:28.253
That guy's having a rough day,
I promise you.

You need to see this.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.916
We received it by courier.

41:57.916 --> 42:01.987
She placed all
Schwartz and Meyer land

42:01.987 --> 42:03.388
in a conservation easement.

42:05.323 --> 42:06.592
Can she do that?

42:07.759 --> 42:11.196
Ellis, can she do that?

42:11.196 --> 42:12.363
She can, and she did.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.802
The board is asking that
you return to New York.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.405
Of course they are.

42:24.610 --> 42:27.813
And this changes things,
with respect to litigation.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.150
New York would like
to drop the suit.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.485
They don't want to throw
good money after bad.

42:36.655 --> 42:40.391
Find a way to ruin this
family, Ellis.

42:40.391 --> 42:43.795
Ruin them.
Starting with her.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.632
I think this is
checkmate, Caroline.

42:46.632 --> 42:48.099
There is no such thing.

42:49.434 --> 42:52.738
Well, what about Sarah,
should she stand down?

42:52.738 --> 42:55.140
There are no rules for Sarah.

42:55.140 --> 42:58.009
Turn her loose.

43:07.252 --> 43:09.988

Get in there.

Carter, they thought it was
real cute watching you cheat

43:45.791 --> 43:47.458
before you hit puberty,

43:47.458 --> 43:48.694
but they ain't going to think
it's cute anymore.

43:48.694 --> 43:50.028
You sit here and you watch.

43:50.028 --> 43:51.830
Is this is how you
celebrate a birthday?

43:51.830 --> 43:53.164
Yes.

43:53.164 --> 43:55.366
Don't you do this
shit every night?

43:55.366 --> 43:56.702
- Yep.
- Pretty much.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.571
How old are you, Lloyd?

44:00.706 --> 44:03.074
He's 85.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.575
58, asshole.

44:04.710 --> 44:05.911
All right, here's the river.

44:05.911 --> 44:08.046
- It's a pretty big birthday.
- I'm all in.

44:08.046 --> 44:09.580
Nope, you don't get it. Call.

44:09.715 --> 44:12.450
- Here. Read 'em and weep.
- Whoo!

44:12.450 --> 44:13.919
Birthday boy.

44:13.919 --> 44:15.586
That would be called
the Dead Man's Hand.

44:15.721 --> 44:17.522
Which is appropriate
considering his age.

44:17.522 --> 44:19.557
Hey, why don't we
go to a bar in Bozeman?

44:19.557 --> 44:20.726
That's a terrible idea.

44:20.726 --> 44:22.027
I think it's
an excellent idea.

44:22.027 --> 44:23.561
The bars in Bozeman, Beth,

44:23.561 --> 44:26.464
are full of tourists
and fake cowboys.

44:26.464 --> 44:28.199
We can go to
a real cowboy bar.

44:28.199 --> 44:30.335
Those don't exist
anymore, honey.

44:30.335 --> 44:32.437
Listen to me,
you take fake cowboys

44:32.437 --> 44:35.106
and you put 'em with
real cowboys in a fucking bar,

44:35.106 --> 44:36.141
and there's gonna
be fighting

44:36.141 --> 44:37.342
and we don't need fighting.

44:37.342 --> 44:39.745
It's a bad idea.
Every time.

44:39.745 --> 44:41.479
Hm. Well, we'll be
home before midnight.

44:41.479 --> 44:44.149
Nothing bad happens
before midnight.

44:44.149 --> 44:46.051
That's what mama
used to say.

44:46.051 --> 44:48.186
- That's true.
- Beth, I said no.

44:51.990 --> 44:55.193
- Oh, you said no, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.963
I guess that settles it.
I'm buying, boys.

Yow!

45:09.074 --> 45:10.275
See you later, baby.

45:13.211 --> 45:15.380
You said "no", huh?

45:15.380 --> 45:17.115
Might have been a
poor choice of words, honey.

45:17.115 --> 45:18.349
I think so.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.988
I'm going to force

Probably the worst idea
this year.

46:20.078 --> 46:21.512
I'd say so.

46:25.917 --> 46:28.119
It's fucking stupid

Isaac Hoskins is gonna keep

47:29.915 --> 47:31.316

You and me.

Hey, look who it is.

48:12.823 --> 48:15.826
- Bar M, no?
- Yes, sir.

48:15.961 --> 48:18.829
Miss, take that whiskey

48:18.964 --> 48:20.631

What are you doing here?

48:43.454 --> 48:45.156
Wife wanted to go dancing.

48:45.156 --> 48:46.992
I told her we should
drive to Three Forks.

48:46.992 --> 48:48.893

48:48.994 --> 48:50.428
I remember when every ass
on a bar stool

48:50.428 --> 48:51.729
belonged to a cowboy.

48:51.729 --> 48:53.831
That was a while ago.

49:27.832 --> 49:29.667

Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

50:19.317 --> 50:20.485

50:27.858 --> 50:30.428
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Take it easy.

50:43.341 --> 50:44.642
Back against that wall.

50:44.642 --> 50:45.643
You know who that is,
don't you?

50:45.643 --> 50:47.445
I know exactly who that is.

50:47.445 --> 50:49.747
You need to stop worrying
about her and start worrying
about you.

50:49.747 --> 50:51.816
Fucking bouncer put her
in a chokehold.

50:51.816 --> 50:53.484
Okay? All hundred
and ten pounds of her.

50:53.484 --> 50:55.286
What would you do
if that was your fuckin' wife?

50:55.286 --> 50:56.454
Look, I hear you.

50:56.454 --> 50:57.888
But these ain't
the old fucking days.

50:57.888 --> 50:59.224
The new Sheriff, he doesn't
put up with this shit.

50:59.224 --> 51:00.825
All right, all right.

51:00.825 --> 51:05.363
You decided to come to town
and toss the entire bar I see.

51:05.363 --> 51:08.899
You put your hands on my wife
then you get the horn.

51:08.899 --> 51:11.169
The fuckin' bouncers had her
in a choke hold.

51:11.169 --> 51:13.138
I could charge every
one of you with battery.

51:13.138 --> 51:14.439
You could.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.707
You could charge the whole
fucking bar if you like.

51:28.886 --> 51:30.221
Okay.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.962
You and the rest can go.

51:37.962 --> 51:40.231
But she hit that girl
in the head with a bottle.

51:40.231 --> 51:42.267
- Come on, now.
- That is aggravated assault.

51:42.267 --> 51:43.668
Is she even going
to fucking press charges?

51:43.668 --> 51:46.871
You bet your fucking ass
I'm pressing charges.

51:46.871 --> 51:49.640
You know this going to be a
problem for you, right, sheriff?

51:51.576 --> 51:53.244
A problem of her own making.

51:53.244 --> 51:55.713
Hm. It's your problem now.

52:04.322 --> 52:06.524
You have the right
to remain silent.

52:06.524 --> 52:09.093
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

52:09.194 --> 52:10.295
You've got to be fucking
kidding me.

52:10.295 --> 52:11.462
You have the
right to an attorney.

52:11.462 --> 52:12.497
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

52:12.497 --> 52:13.598
one will be provided for you.

52:13.598 --> 52:14.965
Do you understand these rights?

52:14.965 --> 52:17.268
You're pressing charges,
you fucking pussy, huh?

52:17.268 --> 52:18.669
I hope you die in there,
you bitch.

52:27.412 --> 52:28.879
Shit. All right, let's go.
Come on.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.001
<i>Next time on Yellowstone...</i>

52:52.403 --> 52:54.305
I stepped on a few
land mines.

52:54.305 --> 52:57.708
Once you open that
Pandora's Box it does not close.

52:57.708 --> 53:01.846
You just sit here and hope she
doesn't file formal charges.

53:01.846 --> 53:04.515
And you are going to stop her.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.851
We do need to talk.
A lot of very unhappy people.

53:06.851 --> 53:07.852
You won't win.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.354
We don't have to win.

53:09.354 --> 53:12.156
We just have to assassinate
your father's reputation.

53:12.257 --> 53:13.491
They will come after you with
both barrels, governor.
