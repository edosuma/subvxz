Just give me a ticket

07:57.291 --> 07:58.979
and lemme get back to

07:55.600 --> 07:58.979
butt-blasting that lake.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.147
I am sorry.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.275
- Between the unmade bed,
- your tardiness to kickball,

08:04.278 --> 08:05.840
And now this,

08:05.841 --> 08:07.403
you are up to three citations.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.552
The rules state you

08:08.553 --> 08:09.697
must be punished.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.846
Why are you picking

08:10.847 --> 08:11.991
on me, man?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.326
- I thought
- we were friends.

08:13.329 --> 08:14.662
Hey, it is not only

08:14.663 --> 08:15.996
you I have cited.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.937
Just because they are

08:18.938 --> 08:19.999
safety scissors,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.918
- does not mean
- you can run with them.

08:22.919 --> 08:23.920
Hoodlums.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.965
- ZURI: Quit it!
- EMMA: No, you quit it!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.760
(GASPS) Hey!

08:31.761 --> 08:33.993
My collection of "Corks That

08:33.994 --> 08:36.222
Look Like Country Stars."

08:36.224 --> 08:38.977
If you broke Corky Chesney,

08:38.979 --> 08:41.730
you're going to be sorry

08:36.224 --> 08:41.729
you ever met me.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.813
I was sorry about

08:42.815 --> 08:43.897
that years ago!

08:43.898 --> 08:44.942
Maybe I should

08:44.943 --> 08:45.983
just switch cabins!

08:45.984 --> 08:47.902
- That's the first good
- idea you've had!

08:47.905 --> 08:49.278
Let me help you move.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.364
Good! Because I want

08:50.365 --> 08:51.447
to get out of here

08:51.448 --> 08:52.616
before you burn the rest

08:52.617 --> 08:53.783
of this cabin down!

08:57.203 --> 08:58.767
What in the wide world

08:58.768 --> 09:00.331
of Woodchucks is

08:57.203 --> 09:00.330
going on in here?

09:00.331 --> 09:01.790
(BOTH YELLING)

09:01.791 --> 09:03.250
Whoa, ladies.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.127
Woodchucks never fight.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.004
Except during mating season.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.255
Then it's no holds barred.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.548
(HISSING)

09:09.549 --> 09:11.884
(BOTH HISSING)

09:11.885 --> 09:13.033
Why are you two having

09:13.034 --> 09:14.179
such a hard

09:11.885 --> 09:14.178
time with this?

09:14.179 --> 09:15.889
- Haven't you lived
- together your whole lives?

09:15.892 --> 09:17.389
Yeah, in a giant penthouse.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.225
- It's so big, my bathroom
- has a closet.

09:19.228 --> 09:20.976
With a bathroom in it.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.354
Lou, you're a real counselor.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.837
Do you think you

09:25.838 --> 09:27.317
could transfer me

09:24.355 --> 09:27.316
to another cabin?

09:27.317 --> 09:29.443
One with less Emma in it?

09:29.444 --> 09:31.050
Hey, Woodchucks also

09:31.051 --> 09:32.654
don't abandon each other.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.429
Unless their burrow

09:34.430 --> 09:36.201
floods, then it's every

09:32.655 --> 09:36.200
'chuck for herself.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.702
Dr. Lou has a better idea.

09:38.703 --> 09:39.997
We're gonna settle this

09:39.998 --> 09:41.288
the Woodchuck way.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.332
Does that mean beat

09:42.333 --> 09:43.373
each other with paddles?

09:43.374 --> 09:44.375
Because I'll crack her

09:44.376 --> 09:45.376
open like a pinata!

09:48.338 --> 09:50.278
No. And remind me

09:50.279 --> 09:52.217
to stay away from you

09:48.338 --> 09:52.217
on Cinco de Mayo.

09:53.885 --> 09:54.886
You're gonna do

09:54.887 --> 09:55.887
Canoe Therapy.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.348
It's my patented conflict

09:57.349 --> 09:58.806
resolution technique.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.538
I'd rather use my patented

10:00.539 --> 10:02.268
technique of just ignoring her

09:58.807 --> 10:02.268
for the rest of the summer.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.437
Ladies,

10:05.438 --> 10:07.398
- if you can work out your
- problems in a tiny canoe,

10:07.401 --> 10:08.796
Then you can work them

10:08.797 --> 10:10.193
out in a slightly

10:07.398 --> 10:10.192
less tiny cabin.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.008
I really am wise

10:12.009 --> 10:13.821
beyond my years.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.052
Can't we solve this

10:15.053 --> 10:16.281
the old-fashioned way?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.889
We give you money,

10:17.890 --> 10:19.494
and you let us do

10:16.282 --> 10:19.494
what we want.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.830
Nice try.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.166
Now, once you've

10:24.167 --> 10:25.499
worked your problems out,

10:25.500 --> 10:27.378
just give a tug

10:27.379 --> 10:29.254
on that rope and I'll pull

10:25.500 --> 10:29.253
you back in.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.546
Do we have to do this?

10:30.547 --> 10:31.548
Nope. You can always

10:31.549 --> 10:32.549
settle your differences

10:32.550 --> 10:33.654
buried neck-deep

10:33.655 --> 10:34.759
in a fire ant hill.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.095
Canoe Therapy it is!

10:39.472 --> 10:40.807
Have fun!

10:43.434 --> 10:44.936
Why are a bunch of campers

10:44.937 --> 10:46.436
working in the mess hall?

10:46.437 --> 10:47.710
Did the rats finally overpower

10:47.711 --> 10:48.981
the kitchen staff?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.630
No, those campers have

10:50.631 --> 10:52.276
each received three citations

10:52.277 --> 10:54.194
and are serving their time.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.613
Although the rats have

10:55.614 --> 10:57.030
overtaken the pantry.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.158
So do not eat

10:58.159 --> 10:59.284
any warm raisins.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.829
Hello, Xander.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.373
Thanks, Jorge.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.585
And fellow bunkmate who should

11:08.586 --> 11:10.795
sleep with one eye open.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.298
Uh, might I please have

11:13.299 --> 11:14.549
a bowl for my chili?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.343
There.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.344
Want a knife?

11:20.221 --> 11:21.807
No. I have a feeling

11:21.808 --> 11:23.391
the chili is dangerous enough.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.082
Why are you having

11:26.083 --> 11:27.436
Jorge serve the food?

11:27.437 --> 11:28.542
I saw him blow his

11:28.543 --> 11:29.647
nose in his own hair.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.776
I am merely enforcing

11:32.777 --> 11:34.318
Gladys's edict.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.821
But it's not exactly making

11:35.822 --> 11:37.321
you popular around here.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.989
I have never been popular.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.241
- In eighth grade,
- I was voted,

11:40.244 --> 11:42.243
- "Guy We Did Not
- Know Went To Our School."

11:43.661 --> 11:44.788
But now I am respected.

11:44.789 --> 11:45.913
(CHUCKLES)

11:45.914 --> 11:48.248
Really?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.375
Because when those kids

11:49.376 --> 11:50.501
in arts and crafts found out

11:48.249 --> 11:50.500
this badge was for you,

11:50.501 --> 11:52.170
this is what they made.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.131
Why would they make this?

12:01.012 --> 12:02.221
Asked and answered.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.349
Look, man.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.434
There are some

12:06.435 --> 12:07.517
good camp rules,

12:07.518 --> 12:09.437
- like never give
- a bear an enema.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.419
But can I give you

12:11.420 --> 12:12.481
some advice?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.233
- Don't sweat
- the small stuff.

12:14.236 --> 12:15.360
But the small stuff leads

12:15.361 --> 12:16.485
to bigger stuff.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.363
- If I had not
- punished Jorge,

12:18.366 --> 12:19.927
Who knows what kind

12:19.928 --> 12:21.491
of trouble he would be

12:18.363 --> 12:21.490
getting into right now?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.951
- I have a feeling you're
- gonna find out.

12:22.954 --> 12:24.576
(CHUCKLES) He just left.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.578
What?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.252
Jorge has flown the coop!

12:34.629 --> 12:36.735
And apparently he

12:36.736 --> 12:38.841
seasoned the chili with

12:34.629 --> 12:38.841
an old boot.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.385

12:51.043 --> 12:52.230
hogged the bathroom then

12:49.852 --> 12:52.230
I would've shaved them!

12:56.401 --> 12:57.776
What are you doing?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.278
- I don't want the sun
- in my eyes.

12:59.281 --> 13:00.530
Well, I don't want

13:00.531 --> 13:01.781
the sun in my eyes!

(GASPS)

13:06.327 --> 13:07.536
Hey, watch it!

13:07.537 --> 13:09.413
It was an accident.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.374
Now this is on purpose.

- splashing a superior,

13:22.430 --> 13:23.553

13:22.427 --> 13:24.678
an imaginary one.

- should be real.

There you are, scofflaw!

13:49.829 --> 13:51.498
You almost gave me

13:51.499 --> 13:53.165
a heart attack!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.542
I should probably

13:54.543 --> 13:55.917
go to the nurse.

Bye!

smoothie through

14:03.217 --> 14:05.887
a licorice straw.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.390
I was carbo-loading.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.623
Speaking of which,

14:12.624 --> 14:14.395
I better go unload.

Uh-oh.

- (SHIVERING)
- I'm freezing.

Quit shivering.

You're shaking the boat,

15:51.098 --> 15:52.535
and I'm trying to do my nails.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.996
You stole my nail file again?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.770
Yes, because the first time,

15:57.771 --> 15:59.541
you took it back.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.293
Now that's on you!

16:01.294 --> 16:02.419
Give that back to me!

16:02.420 --> 16:03.630
No!

16:03.631 --> 16:04.838
(BOTH SCREAMING)

16:04.839 --> 16:06.633
Okay, Lou's stupid

16:06.634 --> 16:08.425
Canoe Therapy isn't working.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.066
- I'm just going to
- have her pull us in.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.600
(GASPS) Oh, no!

16:16.601 --> 16:18.143
I'm at the end of my rope.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.644
So am I.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.814
You're lucky you're

16:20.815 --> 16:21.980
still in this boat!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.378
No, I mean we're no

16:23.379 --> 16:24.774
longer tied to the dock!

16:24.775 --> 16:26.736
- We're just drifting out
- into the middle of the lake!

16:26.739 --> 16:28.008
(GASPS) And Lou took

16:28.009 --> 16:29.279
the paddles!

16:29.280 --> 16:30.906
What are we gonna do?

16:30.907 --> 16:32.263
Um, maybe we can use

16:32.264 --> 16:33.618
our hands to paddle

16:30.907 --> 16:33.617
back to camp!

16:33.618 --> 16:35.202
Right!

16:35.203 --> 16:37.622
Uh, which way is camp?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.082
BOTH: Uh-oh.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.756
- Come on, Xander, - we gotta save
- Emma and Zuri.

16:46.759 --> 16:48.716
- Yeah, I just wrote
- Emma a new song,

16:48.719 --> 16:50.072
And it's way too

16:50.073 --> 16:51.427
upbeat to play

16:48.716 --> 16:51.426
at her funeral!

16:51.427 --> 16:52.616
Don't worry, I know

16:52.617 --> 16:53.803
the lake's drift patterns,

16:53.804 --> 16:55.097
- and it'll take
- at least three hours

16:55.100 --> 16:56.641
- For them to hit
- the deadly rapids.

16:56.644 --> 16:58.309
- How long have they
- been out there?

16:58.312 --> 16:59.519
Four hours.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.062
Ugh.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.440
Maybe you could put

17:04.441 --> 17:06.273
that song in a minor key.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.152
- Is it just me, or is the
- bottom of this canoe

17:08.155 --> 17:09.819
- Made entirely
- of duct tape?

17:09.823 --> 17:11.739
- No. The pink stuff
- is bubble gum.

17:11.742 --> 17:12.906
Paddle!

17:14.742 --> 17:16.140
You are in big

17:16.141 --> 17:17.536
trouble, mister.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.372
- First you disobey
- everything I say,

17:19.375 --> 17:21.332
- And now you
- steal the rules?

17:21.335 --> 17:22.480
This is almost as

17:22.481 --> 17:23.626
ironic as it is naughty!

17:24.794 --> 17:26.358
Okay, okay,

17:26.358 --> 17:27.921
I'll sneak it back.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.299
No, you have done

17:29.300 --> 17:30.674
quite enough.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.509
I shall go sneak it back.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.699
Maybe we can

17:33.700 --> 17:34.887
blame the broken glass

17:32.510 --> 17:34.886
on a clumsy bird.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.723
Or one of your wildly

17:36.724 --> 17:38.558
inaccurate softball throws.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.728
Not the time,

17:41.729 --> 17:43.645
I get that.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.670
You stay right here,

17:45.671 --> 17:47.692
and we will deal with your

17:43.646 --> 17:47.691
punishment when I return.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.673
Are you sure you

17:49.674 --> 17:51.654
can pull this off without

17:47.692 --> 17:51.653
Gladys catching you?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.240
I went through all of middle

17:53.241 --> 17:54.824
school without being

17:51.654 --> 17:54.823
noticed by a female,

17:54.824 --> 17:56.117
I think I got this.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.709
- Gotcha, thief!
- (SHRIEKS)

18:12.174 --> 18:13.508
Why'd you stop?

18:13.509 --> 18:14.532
Because we're paddling

18:14.533 --> 18:15.552
a submarine.

18:15.553 --> 18:16.888
Oh, I just thought it

18:16.889 --> 18:18.221
was really humid.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.515
- We're gonna have
- to swim for it!

18:19.516 --> 18:20.516
Ah!

18:21.225 --> 18:22.310
(SHIVERING)

18:22.977 --> 18:24.603
(GASPING)

18:24.604 --> 18:25.751
Hey, my feet are caught

18:25.752 --> 18:26.896
in some fishing line!

18:26.897 --> 18:28.398
Hang on, I'll free you.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.400
(STRAINING)

18:31.027 --> 18:32.466
Oh, shoot,

18:32.467 --> 18:33.903
now I'm stuck too!

18:33.904 --> 18:35.219
This fishing line

18:35.220 --> 18:36.532
must be caught on

18:33.904 --> 18:36.531
a submerged log.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.699
What do we do now?

18:37.700 --> 18:38.867
Scream!

18:38.868 --> 18:40.076
Emma!

18:40.077 --> 18:41.705
Zuri!

18:41.706 --> 18:43.330
Help!

18:43.331 --> 18:45.583
CIT Ross, you have been

18:45.584 --> 18:47.835
caught with stolen

18:43.331 --> 18:47.834
camp property.

18:47.835 --> 18:48.858
Care to explain

18:48.859 --> 18:49.878
yourself?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.839
- I am so sorry!
- (VOICE BREAKING)

18:51.842 --> 18:53.381
(SOBBING)

18:53.382 --> 18:54.924
That was no fun.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.286
- I didn't even get a chance
- to put you in the spider box.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.972
There is a spider box?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.850
Okay, enough!

19:03.851 --> 19:05.268
Stop yelling at him!

19:05.269 --> 19:06.896
- I haven't even
- started yelling!

19:06.899 --> 19:08.273
Whimpering Willie over here

19:08.274 --> 19:09.649
didn't give me a chance.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.068
Jorge, what are

19:12.069 --> 19:13.276
you doing here?

19:13.277 --> 19:14.779
- I told you to stay
- in the cabin,

19:14.782 --> 19:16.489
- Where you can continue
- to break the rules

19:16.492 --> 19:17.532
And wind,

19:17.533 --> 19:18.574
with reckless abandon!

19:20.368 --> 19:22.245
Gladys, I'm the one who

19:22.246 --> 19:24.120
stole the camp rules.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.122
Not Ravi.

19:26.457 --> 19:27.500
I still do not get

19:27.501 --> 19:28.541
why you did it.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.733
Because you and I were

19:30.734 --> 19:32.922
cool before those dumb

19:28.542 --> 19:32.921
rules came along!

19:32.922 --> 19:34.007
I thought if I got

19:34.008 --> 19:35.090
rid of them,

19:35.091 --> 19:36.550
- I would get
- my friend back.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.324
Finally, I get to

19:39.325 --> 19:40.553
yell at someone!

19:40.554 --> 19:42.014
- Wait!
- Come on!

19:43.474 --> 19:46.184
Actually, this was my fault.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.686
Xander is right.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.647
- I got so caught up in
- enforcing the rules,

19:49.650 --> 19:51.545
That I forgot that the

19:51.546 --> 19:53.442
purpose of camp is to make

19:49.647 --> 19:53.441
friends and have fun.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.818
I'm sorry.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.445
- Bros?
- Bros.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.446
(CHUCKLES)

19:59.448 --> 20:01.576
That was the dumbest thing

20:01.577 --> 20:03.702
I have ever heard in my life!

20:03.703 --> 20:04.913
Clearly you have not heard

20:04.914 --> 20:06.122
Jorge fart Reveille.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.190
Emma, you're paddling

20:12.191 --> 20:13.753
in the wrong direction!

20:13.754 --> 20:15.715
- You mean away from you?
- Seems right to me!

20:17.383 --> 20:18.447
(SHRIEKS)

20:18.448 --> 20:19.510
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

20:20.344 --> 20:21.512
Do you hear that?

20:22.888 --> 20:23.932
We're drifting toward

20:23.933 --> 20:24.973
the rapids!

20:24.974 --> 20:26.767
Paddle! Rapidly!

20:27.935 --> 20:29.542
LOU: Emma! Zuri!

20:29.543 --> 20:31.146
XANDER: Help!

20:31.147 --> 20:32.731
It's Lou and Xander!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.400
- They sound like
- they're in trouble.

20:34.403 --> 20:35.610
We've got to save them

20:35.611 --> 20:36.819
before they

20:34.400 --> 20:36.819
drift into the rapids!

20:39.697 --> 20:42.031
What are you doing?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.953
- I don't want Xander
- to see me with boat hair.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.121
Emma!

20:47.663 --> 20:49.122
Zuri!

20:49.123 --> 20:51.333
Handsome lumberjack!

20:53.002 --> 20:54.962
- What? You had the
- first two picks.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.715
EMMA: Xander! Lou!

20:58.716 --> 21:00.134
Woodchuck sisters!

21:00.135 --> 21:01.551
I knew you'd come!

21:01.552 --> 21:03.429
- You took your sweet
- time about it,

21:03.432 --> 21:04.826
But I guess that's my fault

21:04.827 --> 21:06.223
for taking away your paddles.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.769
Wow, Emma,

21:09.770 --> 21:11.352
your hair looks great!

21:11.353 --> 21:12.354
(CLEARS THROAT)

21:14.982 --> 21:16.276
We're stuck on some

21:16.277 --> 21:17.567
fishing line!

21:17.568 --> 21:19.168
- Don't worry,
- I'll help free you guys!

21:19.570 --> 21:20.571
Somehow.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.324
(GASPS)

21:24.658 --> 21:26.119
Here, use the diamond

21:26.120 --> 21:27.577
nail file to cut the line!

21:27.578 --> 21:28.704
Great idea, Zuri!

21:30.915 --> 21:32.415
Hey.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.501
Careful, Emma.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.008
Hey!

21:41.009 --> 21:42.091
Hey, she got us free!

21:42.092 --> 21:44.093
You guys saved us!

21:44.094 --> 21:45.679
- Let's get back
- to the canoe.

21:46.931 --> 21:47.953
I'm so glad you guys

21:47.954 --> 21:48.973
are safe!

21:48.974 --> 21:50.830
And I see my

21:50.831 --> 21:52.686
Canoe Therapy worked

21:48.974 --> 21:52.685
like a charm.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.813
It did?

21:53.814 --> 21:54.938
Absolutely.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.587
When it mattered,

21:56.588 --> 21:58.234
you worked together to free

21:54.939 --> 21:58.233
me and Xander.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.882
So you and Xander getting

21:59.883 --> 22:01.529
stuck was part of the plan?

22:02.988 --> 22:04.907
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.433
Well, I guess sometimes

22:09.434 --> 22:11.372
we do make a

22:07.493 --> 22:11.371
pretty good team.

22:11.372 --> 22:14.040
Yeah, we do.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.105
I'm sorry for hogging

22:15.106 --> 22:16.167
the bathroom.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.045
- I'll try to be
- more considerate.

22:18.048 --> 22:19.151
And I know you're becoming

22:19.152 --> 22:20.255
a young woman,

22:20.256 --> 22:21.486
and you need

22:21.487 --> 22:22.716
time for hair,

22:20.256 --> 22:22.715
makeup and stuff.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.260
I'll say. Being a woman

22:24.261 --> 22:25.802
is a lot of work.

22:25.803 --> 22:26.929
(GIGGLES)

22:29.890 --> 22:31.684
Aww, this makes me feel

22:31.685 --> 22:33.476
all warm inside.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.729
Which is good, because

22:34.730 --> 22:35.980
I think I have hypothermia.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.276
Soup's on, boss!

22:41.277 --> 22:42.591
You know,

22:42.592 --> 22:43.903
if I have to be punished,

22:43.904 --> 22:45.488
I'm glad it's with you.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.156
Me too, Jorge.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.388
And it kind of feels

22:48.389 --> 22:49.617
good just to be a CIT again,

22:49.618 --> 22:51.120
- and not a cop
- on the edge.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.124
Enjoy!

22:58.085 --> 22:59.754
Hey, that's where

22:59.755 --> 23:01.422
my sock went.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.509
Trust me, that is the

23:05.510 --> 23:07.177
least disgusting

23:03.841 --> 23:07.177
ingredient in there.
