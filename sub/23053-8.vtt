I'm sorry, you

16:39.499 --> 16:42.084
don't want our help?

16:42.126 --> 16:45.045
[laugh] That's... that's

16:42.126 --> 16:45.045
ridiculous.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.048
What reason could you

16:45.087 --> 16:48.048
possibly have for that?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.802
Because you're driving

16:48.090 --> 16:50.802
us crazy!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.053
Oh, really?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.890
And just how am I

16:53.095 --> 16:55.890
driving you crazy?

16:55.932 --> 16:58.058
By always coming up with plans!

16:58.100 --> 17:00.520
I don't need a plan!

17:00.561 --> 17:05.024
I mean, maybe I do, but

17:00.561 --> 17:05.024
it'll be mine, not yours.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.153
Well, I'm sorry

17:06.108 --> 17:09.153
for trying to help!

[sobbing]

17:12.866 --> 17:14.701
And you're not any better.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.661
I'm not a filly.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.790
I'm a grown pony with a job to

17:16.703 --> 17:20.790
do and I'll do it on my own.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.003
Well, I'll let you

17:22.667 --> 17:25.003
get to it, then.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.256
Great.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.758
Now we have to smooth things

17:29.298 --> 17:30.758
over with our parents

17:30.800 --> 17:34.053
on top of finding and solving

17:30.800 --> 17:34.053
a friendship problem.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.640
It's almost like our

17:34.846 --> 17:37.640
relationship with our parents

17:37.682 --> 17:39.058
is the friendship problem.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.101
You don't think

17:39.642 --> 17:41.101
that's it, do you?

17:41.143 --> 17:42.979
Ahem.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.397
That's what all

17:43.021 --> 17:44.397
of us think.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.900
Agh!

17:46.941 --> 17:48.275
[thud]

17:48.317 --> 17:52.071
Why couldn't we have been sent

17:48.317 --> 17:52.071
to stop a war or something?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.120
Dad?

18:00.162 --> 18:02.248
Hello, Ms. Glimmer.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.250
How is your friendship

18:02.289 --> 18:04.250
problem search going?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.753
I only ask as an

18:04.291 --> 18:06.753
interested observer,

18:06.794 --> 18:08.922
since I know you are an

18:06.794 --> 18:08.922
adult who's capable

18:08.963 --> 18:11.591
of doing things without

18:08.963 --> 18:11.591
help from any pony else.

18:13.051 --> 18:17.513
Actually, I think Sunburst

18:13.051 --> 18:17.513
and I figured out what it is.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.768
So, Stellar and I weren't

18:18.180 --> 18:21.768
really helpful after all.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.145
Well, we haven't

18:22.184 --> 18:25.145
actually solved it.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.147
And I don't think we can.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.148
Not without you.

Pungent!

18:39.619 --> 18:42.246
Oh, did you come by

18:39.619 --> 18:42.246
to be driven crazy

18:42.288 --> 18:44.874
by more of your mother's plans?

18:45.207 --> 18:48.210
No, I came to apologize.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.171
Well, it's going to take

18:48.252 --> 18:51.171
more than an apology

18:51.213 --> 18:53.800
to make up for telling me

18:51.213 --> 18:53.800
you don't want my help

18:53.841 --> 18:55.635
finding your

18:53.841 --> 18:55.635
friendship problem.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.386
Oh, I'm not sorry for that.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.680
Starlight and I already figured

18:57.428 --> 18:59.680
out what the problem is.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.141
This is a terrible apology.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.979
Well, if you come with

19:03.267 --> 19:05.979
me and help fix it,

19:06.020 --> 19:07.146
I'll give you a better one.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.152
Usually, Twilight or one of

19:10.232 --> 19:13.152
our other friends gets called

19:13.193 --> 19:15.947
to a place with a

19:13.193 --> 19:15.947
friendship problem to fix.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.198
But Starlight and I

19:15.989 --> 19:18.198
realized we came here

19:18.240 --> 19:21.201
to fix a friendship

19:18.240 --> 19:21.201
problem we already had.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.122
I'm sorry I've been

19:21.243 --> 19:24.122
avoiding coming home, Dad,

19:24.163 --> 19:27.166
but you can't keep

19:24.163 --> 19:27.166
treating me like a foal.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.836
I'm sorry, Sugarbun!

[chuckle]

19:32.254 --> 19:35.883
I just know how hard things

19:32.254 --> 19:35.883
were for you when you left home.

19:35.925 --> 19:41.097
I guess I wanted you to feel

19:35.925 --> 19:41.097
safe, like when you were young.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.141
Dad, I know I've

19:41.139 --> 19:43.141
made some mistakes,

19:43.182 --> 19:45.225
and I'll probably

19:43.182 --> 19:45.225
make a bunch more,

19:45.267 --> 19:47.103
but I learn from them.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.022
I think that's

19:47.145 --> 19:49.022
what growing up is.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.986
I'm sorry I never told you how

19:52.066 --> 19:54.986
much your plans bothered me,

19:55.028 --> 19:57.237
and I know you just

19:55.028 --> 19:57.237
want me to succeed,

19:57.279 --> 19:59.198
but I need to do

19:57.279 --> 19:59.198
that on my own.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.241
I remember how

19:59.782 --> 20:01.241
lost you were

20:01.283 --> 20:04.203
when you flunked out

20:01.283 --> 20:04.203
of magic school.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.246
I thought as long

20:04.244 --> 20:06.246
as you had a plan,

20:06.288 --> 20:08.708
you'd never feel

20:06.288 --> 20:08.708
that way again.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.126
You don't have to worry, Mom.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.170
I need to find my own way,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.338
but I definitely don't

20:12.211 --> 20:14.338
feel lost anymore.

I don't suppose

doesn't work that way.

Not unless we solved a

20:44.326 --> 20:48.539

You know, it seems to me your

your parents, we're

your friends too.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.382
I guess so.

less like a little filly

21:01.844 --> 21:04.430
and more like a friend,

Absolutely.

drive me crazy again,

21:11.771 --> 21:14.107
of never coming home.
