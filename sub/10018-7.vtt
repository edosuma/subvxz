00:06.867 --> 00:08.688
Previously on E.R.

00:09.772 --> 00:12.101
- Morning.
- I've overlooked a lot of your behavior.

00:13.035 --> 00:14.430
Now a medical student?

00:14.431 --> 00:15.949
I slept with Doug Ross.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.585
If you were smart, you'd give her
another chance.

00:18.586 --> 00:21.573
I'm a new physician assistant.
I start my ER rotation today.

00:21.574 --> 00:24.297
Can we at least pretend to be civil?
Professional?

00:24.298 --> 00:27.310
Well, let this serve as notice
you will not be renewed.

00:27.311 --> 00:28.341
You're out of here.

00:28.342 --> 00:30.316
- He's a good doctor.
- But he's a loose cannon.

00:30.317 --> 00:31.406
I've been here a few years.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.382
It's the longest commitment I've ever
made to anything or anybody.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.532
"Hell And High Water"

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:57.843 --> 01:01.883
- Where's your little girl?
- I don't have one.

01:02.051 --> 01:05.961
- Where's your little boy?
- I'm all by myself.

01:06.134 --> 01:09.251
- Are you sick?
- No, no.

01:09.426 --> 01:11.251
Then why are you here?

01:13.926 --> 01:16.295
- For a job.
- You don't have a job?

01:16.509 --> 01:20.454
- Did you see the pretty fish over there?
- Did you lose your job?

01:20.675 --> 01:23.507
My daddy lost his job.

01:25.717 --> 01:29.164
- Did you get a new job?
- Yes, giving big shots to little girls.

01:31.091 --> 01:35.832
- Mommy!
- Big shots. There you go.

01:36.049 --> 01:40.339
- Mrs. Riblet. Weak and dizzy all over.
- Be still my heart.

01:40.507 --> 01:42.794
- Smell something?
- Yeah.

01:42.966 --> 01:46.331
Ma'am, smoking is not permitted
in the hospital.

01:46.507 --> 01:50.003
This is my glaucoma medicine.
My grandson grows it.

01:51.049 --> 01:53.288
Oh, no, thanks. Put that there.

01:53.465 --> 01:57.589
Why don't we put these away,
so that we don't get busted?

01:57.757 --> 01:59.877
- Smells like primo stuff.
- Yeah?

02:00.048 --> 02:02.537
God, I miss the '60s.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.995
- New computer?
- Yeah. CD-ROM.

02:06.173 --> 02:09.455
I'm connecting us up by modem
to Mount Sinai. Pooling our resources.

02:09.631 --> 02:12.463
A couple more things.
Dr. Benton goes nuts if you're late...

02:12.631 --> 02:15.747
...or don't answer a page on
the first beep. He has a bad temper.

02:15.922 --> 02:18.411
- I'll have to remember that.
- Never contradict him...

02:18.589 --> 02:19.916
...in front of an Attending.

02:20.089 --> 02:22.659
- Who made brownies?
- Wendy Goldman.

02:22.839 --> 02:24.497
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:24.672 --> 02:27.042
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

02:27.213 --> 02:31.254
- I think I deleted Radiology.
- Well, did you back it up?

02:31.422 --> 02:34.419
- Was I supposed to?
- Try Alt Q. That sometimes works.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.579
Hit-and-run pulling up.
Ten-year-old girl.

02:36.755 --> 02:39.871
- Where's Ross?
- A job interview.

02:40.338 --> 02:43.454
Hit-and-run, no witnesses.
Found unconscious, responsive to pain.

02:43.629 --> 02:46.331
BP 140/90. Resp low at 10.
Tubed her in the field.

02:46.504 --> 02:49.621
Multiple facial lacs, possible fracture
to right lower extremity.

02:49.921 --> 02:51.579
Get Radiology down here. Trauma 2.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.752
- What's her name?
- Lunch box says "Molly Phillips. "

02:54.920 --> 02:57.041
Somebody call her parents.

02:58.129 --> 03:01.043
All right, nice and easy.
Keep bagging her.

03:01.212 --> 03:04.126
Here we go, people. On my count.
One, two, three.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.085
All right, people, let's learn something.

03:09.003 --> 03:12.534
Carter, how do you check for spinal cord
injury on an unconscious patient?

03:12.711 --> 03:14.867
- Look for absence of tendon reflexes.
- Do it.

03:15.044 --> 03:17.035
Poor little thing.

03:17.211 --> 03:21.418
- Harper, what film do we want first?
- Chest?

03:21.586 --> 03:25.414
I'll do a cross-table lateral
to rule out a C-spine fracture.

03:25.585 --> 03:28.785
Deep tendon reflexes are present
bilaterally. Babinski is normal.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.036
Harper, let's talk head trauma.
What study should we do?

03:33.210 --> 03:36.575
- Come on, Harper. Pay attention.
- Pressure's falling, 50/30.

03:36.752 --> 03:38.410
What do you hear?

03:41.168 --> 03:42.993
Diminished breath sounds on the right?

03:43.168 --> 03:45.491
I appreciate air movement bilaterally.
No pneumo.

03:45.668 --> 03:48.998
- No, that's upper airway sounds.
- I see a tracheal shift to the left.

03:49.168 --> 03:50.708
- So do I.
- Tension pneumo.

03:50.876 --> 03:53.708
Good call. I'll teach you how to do
a needle decompression.

03:53.876 --> 03:55.831
Carter, run the blood up to the lab.

04:00.084 --> 04:02.750
Our new Urgent Care Facility
could use someone like you.

04:02.917 --> 04:05.405
- Urgent Care's a smart move.
- Most emergencies are...

04:05.583 --> 04:08.700
...run-of-the-mill stuff.
Sprained ankles, croup, concussions...

04:08.875 --> 04:12.999
You'll spend most of your time on ear
infections and well-baby checkups.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.659
Private practice is changing.

04:14.833 --> 04:17.914
We're chasing PPO contracts
to compete against the HMOs.

04:18.083 --> 04:21.413
- We won't sacrifice our commitment.
- That's what Pedes is all about.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.905
We're a family here.
The kids you see today...

04:24.082 --> 04:26.831
...will be the parents of the kids
you'll see in 20 years.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.871
We believe in continuity
and commitment.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.782
So do I.

04:30.957 --> 04:34.618
- So do you want to join our family?
- Yes, I do.

05:31.829 --> 05:33.238
How's she doing, Peter?

05:33.412 --> 05:36.410
She's stable.
We're just going over her films now.

05:37.537 --> 05:40.570
Nasty break. Anybody want
to take a crack at reading it?

05:40.745 --> 05:44.573
Type three tibial and fibular fracture
with complete displacement.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.494
- Thirty percent chance of nonunion.
- Excellent.

05:47.661 --> 05:50.659
- Were knee and ankle films ordered?
- I don't believe so.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.783
Knee and ankle films are necessary...

05:53.203 --> 05:55.489
...to rule out injuries
from transmitted forces.

05:55.994 --> 05:59.324
She's right as rain, Peter.
Order the films.

05:59.494 --> 06:03.653
Come on. I've got a couple interesting
Colles fractures you may wanna look at.

06:03.827 --> 06:07.109
Have you ever seen
a middle ear bone fracture?

06:10.744 --> 06:13.232
- Hey. How did the interview go?
- Great.

06:13.410 --> 06:15.733
- What did they say?
- They said I was great.

06:15.910 --> 06:18.742
- Did you get the job?
- Ninety grand a year and nobody dies.

06:18.910 --> 06:21.233
Hallelujah. Auf Wiedersehen.
I'll see you around.

06:31.118 --> 06:33.653
- You okay?
- Sure.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.065
Is this what you really want?

06:37.951 --> 06:39.692
Do I have a choice?

06:46.367 --> 06:49.530
Molly? Molly, do you know
where you are?

06:50.617 --> 06:53.698
You' re in the hospital.
You were hit by a car.

06:53.866 --> 06:55.987
We're taking very good care of you.

07:01.324 --> 07:03.315
You like my ring?

07:05.657 --> 07:08.572
I know you're scared,
but I'll stay with you.

07:09.116 --> 07:11.569
We called your parents.
They'll be here very soon.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.902
Okay, let's extubate her. Carter...

07:15.074 --> 07:18.274
- What's her tidal volume?
-500 ccs. Gases are good.

07:18.449 --> 07:19.645
All right. Excellent.

07:19.823 --> 07:23.153
- We're gonna take this tube out.
- Squeeze my hand.

07:23.323 --> 07:25.812
Make sure the cuff is down
before you extubate her.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.396
Good. Now, what I want you
to do is pretend...

07:31.573 --> 07:34.985
...you're blowing out your birthday
candles. Take another big breath.

07:35.156 --> 07:37.360
When I say go,
blow out real hard, okay?

07:38.322 --> 07:39.732
Go.

07:41.281 --> 07:43.650
- Nice.
- Good job. Good job.

07:43.822 --> 07:47.401
Okay, let's send her for a head CT.
I'll be in Exam 2.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.399
- What's your name?
- What?

07:51.572 --> 07:53.278
What's your name?

07:54.447 --> 07:57.361
- I'm Harper. This is John.
- Hi, Molly.

08:06.404 --> 08:09.237
Good. Other eye. Yeah.

08:10.279 --> 08:13.894
Your optic discs are perfectly normal.

08:14.071 --> 08:19.142
- Are you sure you have glaucoma?
- My medicine must be working.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.650
- How long have you been lightheaded?
- I wouldn't call it lightheaded.

08:22.820 --> 08:24.727
It's more like I float.

08:24.903 --> 08:28.150
- How long have you been floating?
- About two weeks.

08:28.362 --> 08:30.566
How long have you been
smoking marijuana?

08:31.236 --> 08:33.357
About two weeks.

08:35.070 --> 08:38.765
- Having trouble?
- I lost Radiology.

08:38.943 --> 08:40.650
- That's bad.
- No kidding.

08:40.818 --> 08:43.308
- You have a file-recovery disc?
- No.

08:43.486 --> 08:45.441
Let me have a go at it.

08:50.235 --> 08:53.399
A couple damaged clusters,
but everything looks intact.

08:53.610 --> 08:59.061
Jerry? Could you keep Mrs. Riblet's
valuables while she gets a CT?

08:59.235 --> 09:01.806
- Help yourself, honey.
- Sure thing.

09:01.985 --> 09:05.765
- Can I stay and watch Geraldo?
- And disappoint Radiology?

09:05.943 --> 09:08.182
- What are you doing here?
- Mozart ring a bell?

09:08.360 --> 09:10.682
- Fantasy of the Opera? The Magic Flute?
- No.

09:10.859 --> 09:13.692
The charity ball.
You promised you'd go.

09:13.859 --> 09:15.400
- That's tonight?
- Yeah.

09:15.568 --> 09:18.103
The tickets cost my company 300 bucks.

09:18.276 --> 09:21.357
- Here's your costume, Don Giovanni.
- No, no, no...

09:21.526 --> 09:24.891
- That's tights. I'll just wear a tux.
- No.

09:25.067 --> 09:27.555
Pick me up at 7.
That'll give you an hour to change.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.061
Yeah, well...

09:29.233 --> 09:31.141
- What are you going as?
- Carmen.

09:31.317 --> 09:33.473
- Don't be late.
- Yeah.

09:34.192 --> 09:35.898
I think you're gonna need this.

09:44.608 --> 09:47.854
Mrs. Wilson has been admitted
with coffee-ground emesis 14 times...

09:48.024 --> 09:49.351
...with the same symptoms.

09:49.524 --> 09:52.854
Order all her charts and write a summary
of all her discharge notes...

09:53.024 --> 09:54.647
...by tomorrow.

10:01.482 --> 10:03.970
- You got the computer fixed?
- Yeah. Linda Farrell.

10:04.148 --> 10:06.767
- Why do you smell like dope?
- I've been with a patient.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.021
- We're hooked up to Mount Sinai?
- Beating the crap out of them.

10:10.190 --> 10:11.979
- What are you doing?
- Playing Doom II.

10:12.148 --> 10:14.471
- How long does it take to play?
- Months.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.930
I've done thoracotomies
that were less bloody.

10:18.106 --> 10:20.429
He doesn't understand
the educational value.

10:20.606 --> 10:23.177
Die, bastard. Die. Come on!

10:25.064 --> 10:28.015
- How are you feeling?
- Okay. I knew you'd come.

10:28.189 --> 10:32.976
- Sweetie, of course we would.
- I want to go home.

10:33.147 --> 10:36.975
Your daughter will be in the hospital
at least several days. Excuse me.

10:38.563 --> 10:42.260
- Will both of you stay with me?
- Of course, sweetheart.

10:42.438 --> 10:44.263
And, Daddy...

10:45.230 --> 10:47.267
...will you come back
to live with us?

10:50.271 --> 10:53.434
- Well...
- We'll talk about that later.

10:53.604 --> 10:56.175
How could you let her ride her bike
in the rain?

10:56.354 --> 10:58.889
- Don't blame me for this.
- Who else let her do it?

10:59.062 --> 11:00.768
I'm doing the best I can.

11:01.562 --> 11:04.762
If you spent more time with her
and less at the office with Sarah-

11:04.937 --> 11:08.930
The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
If either of you have a photo of Molly...

11:09.103 --> 11:11.888
...it would help him repair
the laceration on her cheek.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.934
- Same picture.
- Lake Geneva. It was a great vacation.

11:20.394 --> 11:22.053
Just need one.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.551
Hey, pumpkin.

11:27.727 --> 11:29.801
Handled that very well.

11:29.977 --> 11:32.382
I practice in my own family.

12:57.098 --> 12:58.721
Help! Help! Please, help!

12:58.889 --> 13:00.596
Please! Help!

13:01.848 --> 13:03.885
- What?
- Please, my brother needs help!

13:04.056 --> 13:07.137
- Why? Why?
- Hurry! He's gonna drown!

13:07.347 --> 13:10.014
Okay. Hang on, hang on. Hang on!

13:24.971 --> 13:28.419
We were playing in the tunnel.
My brother got trapped.

13:28.596 --> 13:30.254
Come on.

13:37.012 --> 13:38.671
There you go.

13:43.012 --> 13:46.424
Give me your hand.
Hang on, we're coming in!

13:51.762 --> 13:54.131
- Are you hurt?
- My leg's stuck.

13:54.303 --> 13:58.083
Hang in there. Don't panic.
We'll get you out of here.

13:59.261 --> 14:01.133
- What's your name?
- Ben.

14:01.303 --> 14:04.834
Hey, Ben. I'm Doug.

14:05.011 --> 14:10.000
Let's see if I can move some of this
stuff out of the way here.

14:12.344 --> 14:15.046
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal...

14:15.219 --> 14:17.542
...and the water started
coming real fast.

14:17.719 --> 14:21.926
- Just get it out, please. Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.

14:22.093 --> 14:24.664
It ain't my fault, Joey.
The water just pushed me.

14:24.843 --> 14:27.794
All right, settle down, fellas.
It's nobody's fault.

14:28.468 --> 14:32.047
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.

14:32.218 --> 14:35.381
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day. I'm a doctor.

14:35.551 --> 14:39.627
- Let me check this. Does this hurt?
- Yeah, a lot.

14:39.801 --> 14:42.372
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?

14:42.551 --> 14:45.833
- It might be.
- Oh, no.

14:46.009 --> 14:49.042
- No, no...
- Don't cry, Ben.

14:49.217 --> 14:52.796
Yeah, Ben. Don't cry. It's nothing
compared to what I've seen.

14:52.967 --> 14:57.458
- Let's get him out, okay?
- Please, please, get me out of here!

14:57.633 --> 15:02.623
It's gonna be a piece of cake.
When I was a kid I used to build...

15:02.800 --> 15:06.414
- I used to build forts in these tunnels.
- You did?

15:06.591 --> 15:08.167
Yeah.

15:09.341 --> 15:15.089
You gotta watch, because when it rains,
the water comes up really quick.

15:17.132 --> 15:20.379
Joey, listen to me.
You go find a phone. You call 911.

15:20.549 --> 15:25.087
You tell them to send a rescue squad.
All right, Joey? Go! Go!

15:25.257 --> 15:30.412
- Well, where's he going?
- Well, this grate is locked.

15:30.590 --> 15:34.121
- I'm gonna need a little help.
- But you said you could do it.

15:34.298 --> 15:37.296
- What's that light down there?
- I don't know.

15:38.090 --> 15:40.127
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Don't leave!

15:40.298 --> 15:42.123
- I'll be right back.
- Wait. Just don't!

15:42.298 --> 15:45.745
Ben, listen to me. I'm gonna get you
out of here. I promise you that.

15:45.923 --> 15:50.379
But you gotta do me a favor, okay?
You gotta trust me. Can you do that?

15:51.714 --> 15:53.539
- Okay.
- Okay? All right.

15:53.714 --> 15:58.288
Here's the first thing I need you to do.
You gotta curl up like this, into a ball.

15:58.464 --> 16:01.130
Real tight, like that.
As tight as you can. Okay?

16:01.297 --> 16:04.413
That's gonna keep you warm.
I'm gonna see what that light is.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.875
I'll be back as fast as I can, all right?

16:07.046 --> 16:10.128
Like a ball. Like that. Now sit tight.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.707
All right.

16:48.044 --> 16:51.042
- Ben, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

16:52.794 --> 16:56.160
- All right. Are you okay?
- Yeah. Did you find something?

17:05.127 --> 17:06.785
Come on!

17:27.751 --> 17:30.037
Hello, is anybody there?

17:38.167 --> 17:40.039
It was blocked.

17:41.125 --> 17:44.123
- I'm so cold.
- That's all right, buddy.

17:44.291 --> 17:45.749
Can you wiggle your toes?

17:47.125 --> 17:48.866
No.

17:49.333 --> 17:52.994
That's okay. How about your fingers?
Can you move those? There you go.

17:53.166 --> 17:56.448
- Can you feel me squeezing your hand?
- A little.

17:56.624 --> 17:59.159
Good. All right.

17:59.332 --> 18:02.247
Now all you gotta do is
just think warm thoughts.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.453
You gotta think Hawaii...

18:04.624 --> 18:08.617
...and you gotta think
the Sahara Desert.

18:10.248 --> 18:12.286
You gotta think about...

18:14.623 --> 18:17.823
Come here! Come on! You listen to me.
You gotta stay awake!

18:18.540 --> 18:21.242
You gotta stay awake for me, all right?
Okay. All right?

18:21.415 --> 18:23.452
- I'm so tired.
- I know that.

18:23.623 --> 18:25.080
Why don't we just sing a song.

18:25.248 --> 18:28.281
- You know songs, don't you?
- No.

18:29.289 --> 18:31.694
All right, yeah. Yeah.

18:31.872 --> 18:36.411
How about
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game"?

18:49.621 --> 18:53.697
All right, listen. Come here.
I've gotta get some help.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.447
- No! Don't go. Don't!
- It's okay.

18:55.621 --> 18:56.900
Please, don't.

18:57.079 --> 19:00.409
You gotta sing as loud as you can,
so I can hear you. All right?

19:00.579 --> 19:02.120
- Say yes to me. Come here.
- Yeah.

19:02.287 --> 19:04.112
All right. Here we go.

19:40.827 --> 19:45.034
- Hey, hey! I couldn't find it.
- Come here. What?

19:45.202 --> 19:48.816
I couldn't find a phone.
I couldn't find a phone anywhere.

19:48.993 --> 19:50.616
I couldn't find a phone.

19:52.285 --> 19:55.946
Come here. Come on. All right, listen.
You go in there, and you find a phone.

19:56.118 --> 19:59.779
You call 911, and you stay here till
help gets here. You understand?

19:59.951 --> 20:01.278
Go! Let's go!

20:19.367 --> 20:20.943
You all right?

20:22.742 --> 20:25.609
Hey, hey! Hey, buddy!

20:29.783 --> 20:34.487
- I sang it four times.
- I knew you could do it.

20:36.324 --> 20:39.606
Hey, stay awake!
You gotta stay awake for me.

20:39.907 --> 20:43.439
Come on, you gotta stay awake!
All right, this will do the trick.

20:43.616 --> 20:48.107
We'll use this jack to get your leg out.
So are you a Cubs fan?

20:49.657 --> 20:51.694
Yeah? Who's your favorite player?

20:53.073 --> 20:56.439
Who's your favorite player, Ben?
Hey, come on! Who's your favorite?

20:59.656 --> 21:02.939
- Mark Grace.
- Mark Grace?

21:03.990 --> 21:08.232
What? Are you nuts?
Shawon Dunston's the man.

21:09.823 --> 21:13.686
Best shortstop in the game.
I'll tell you what I'll do.

21:13.864 --> 21:17.230
Next season I'll take you to
Wrigley Field. Come on, stick with me!

21:17.406 --> 21:20.273
Stay here.
I'll take you to Wrigley Field...

21:22.405 --> 21:25.072
Come on, damn it!
We'll get a couple of dogs...

21:26.863 --> 21:30.110
...then we'll compare Grace to Dunston.
All right?

21:30.863 --> 21:32.653
There you go.

21:32.821 --> 21:35.654
Hey, stay up! Stay awake!
Keep your head up.

21:35.821 --> 21:38.938
Keep your head above water. All right.

21:39.113 --> 21:43.651
All right, so you think that you know
a lot about baseball, do you?

21:43.821 --> 21:46.274
Come on. All right.

21:46.446 --> 21:48.650
Ask me a question.

21:49.571 --> 21:53.434
Come on. Ask me a tough one. Let's go.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.480
Stay with me. Stay up. Stay up!

21:57.945 --> 22:00.647
- Most home runs?
- Most home runs?

22:02.153 --> 22:04.772
Hank Aaron beats Babe Ruth.
That's nothing.

22:04.945 --> 22:07.268
That's an easy one.
Here we go. Are you ready?

22:07.445 --> 22:11.604
Okay, we got it. We got it.
All right, come here.

22:11.778 --> 22:15.309
- You gotta push your leg out. Ready?
- I can't feel...

22:15.486 --> 22:17.891
It's okay, I'll help you.
All right, here we go.

22:20.652 --> 22:23.899
All right, buddy. It's okay.
Come here. Come here.

22:24.069 --> 22:27.315
All right, listen, give me your hands.
You gotta hold on right here.

22:27.485 --> 22:30.317
Hold on with both hands.
You hold on!

22:30.485 --> 22:33.436
You gotta keep your head up
above water. Do you understand?

22:33.610 --> 22:37.307
- Yes, you do.
- I can't...

22:37.485 --> 22:41.064
- I can't hold...
- I'll knock out these hinges.

22:44.859 --> 22:46.767
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

22:46.943 --> 22:49.775
- I can't!
- Yes-

22:49.942 --> 22:52.609
Yes, you can. Hey! Damn it!

22:52.776 --> 22:55.015
You hold on, damn it! You hold on.

22:55.900 --> 22:59.645
You hold on. You hold on!
You understand me?

22:59.817 --> 23:04.273
Hold on! Here we go.
Come on. We almost did it.

23:04.692 --> 23:06.647
No, I-

23:12.858 --> 23:15.772
No! Ben! Come here!

23:43.940 --> 23:47.933
No! Ben!

23:50.606 --> 23:52.478
Ben!

24:22.854 --> 24:25.259
You're not dying on me, Ben!

24:31.604 --> 24:33.393
Not now!

24:42.812 --> 24:45.347
Hey. I shot the Hell Knight
with my plasma rifle...

24:45.520 --> 24:47.806
...but he nailed me
with a rocket launcher.

24:47.978 --> 24:49.636
Watch out for the fireballs.

24:49.811 --> 24:51.967
- Excuse me, Dr. Benton.
- Yeah?

24:52.145 --> 24:55.344
I sorted through the charts
and compiled the discharge summaries.

24:55.519 --> 24:58.304
I think your patient has
a paraesophageal hernia.

24:59.561 --> 25:02.263
If you need anything else,
I'll be in the Suture Room.

25:07.269 --> 25:09.425
- Where are we going?
- To a nicer room.

25:09.602 --> 25:11.391
My lunch box...

25:13.102 --> 25:14.725
There we go.

25:14.893 --> 25:19.017
Don't you be scared. I'll stay with you
until we take you upstairs.

25:19.893 --> 25:23.259
- I made it in school.
- It's beautiful.

25:23.435 --> 25:26.183
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

25:26.351 --> 25:28.591
- Nice.
- Yeah.

25:29.226 --> 25:32.757
- The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
- We won't be needing your surgeon.

25:32.934 --> 25:34.841
- Excuse me?
- My plastic surgeon's coming.

25:35.017 --> 25:36.344
- Who?
- Fred.

25:36.517 --> 25:40.427
- Fred Mendoza? He'll cost a fortune.
- It's only your daughter's face.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.930
- No, I hate him. That's why you called.
- He's the best in Chicago.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.174
For lopsided breasts.

25:49.558 --> 25:51.513
Touchy subject.

26:10.641 --> 26:13.129
- Is he all right?
- Mouth-to-mouth's not working.

26:13.307 --> 26:16.056
- His airway's blocked.
- Paramedics are coming any minute.

26:16.224 --> 26:20.762
- That Medevac copter will take us.
- That's a TV news chopper.

26:21.557 --> 26:26.095
- Is my brother going to die?
- No, he is not! No, he is not!

26:27.431 --> 26:30.678
- What are you doing?
- I'm a doctor. I need to clear an airway.

26:35.431 --> 26:36.924
- You got a pen?
- What?

26:37.097 --> 26:38.720
A pen? Do you have a pen on you?

26:51.597 --> 26:52.971
Here we go.

26:57.971 --> 26:59.843
Come on! All right.

27:02.263 --> 27:04.751
Come on. Breathe, damn it!

27:09.596 --> 27:12.926
All right, here we go.
Come here. Help me out.

27:13.096 --> 27:16.757
Get him up, get him up. I got him.

27:16.929 --> 27:18.587
I got him.

27:33.178 --> 27:36.543
- What do you got?
- A 12-year-old trapped in a culvert.

27:36.719 --> 27:39.587
Possible fracture
to the left lower extremity.

27:39.761 --> 27:43.209
Don't jostle him. He's hypothermic.
You can cause an arrhythmia.

27:43.386 --> 27:46.798
I'm Dr. Ross. I work in County ER.

27:47.802 --> 27:51.132
I need a number six ETtube.
There we go.

27:51.302 --> 27:54.086
- I need a portable O-2 and an ambu-bag.
- You got it.

27:54.260 --> 27:57.009
We picked up a paramedic call.
What happened?

27:57.177 --> 28:01.668
- He saved my brother. He's a doctor.
- Here, let's roll on this.

28:01.843 --> 28:04.794
We're at the scene
of an incredible rescue.

28:04.968 --> 28:08.380
It appears that a doctor has saved
a little boy from drowning.

28:08.551 --> 28:10.506
We got it, doc. Call Mercy.

28:10.676 --> 28:14.752
- Mercy's not a Level 1 trauma center.
- It's the nearest treatment facility.

28:14.926 --> 28:18.256
This boy needs a surgeon.
Probably an ICU.

28:18.426 --> 28:20.002
We gotta follow station protocol.

28:20.176 --> 28:23.588
- What's your transport time?
- In this weather, maybe 12 minutes.

28:23.759 --> 28:26.212
- Where's your pilot?
- Hey, Jimmy! Over here!

28:26.384 --> 28:29.417
- Sorry, doc. We got to move.
- Wait, wait.

28:29.592 --> 28:31.084
We're losing time.

28:31.258 --> 28:34.090
- What's your flight time to County ER?
-15 minutes.

28:34.258 --> 28:36.925
- Will you take us?
- We're not medically equipped.

28:37.091 --> 28:40.338
- He's hypothermic, needs special care.
- Mercy is closer.

28:40.508 --> 28:44.418
- Then he dies because there's no ICU.
- Or else he dies in a news chopper.

28:44.591 --> 28:49.924
I don't have time to argue with you.
I will take full responsibility for this.

28:50.091 --> 28:51.998
This boy is gonna die!

28:53.549 --> 28:56.333
Let's do it. It's a great story. Let's go!

28:57.257 --> 28:59.294
- What are you doing?
- I need supplies.

29:00.049 --> 29:03.663
- I need a portable defibrillator.
- I got a spare.

29:04.257 --> 29:07.456
- You're taking a hell of a chance.
- Damn right! Let's go!

29:17.214 --> 29:20.544
Hold it right there. Here we go.
One, two, three.

29:24.256 --> 29:27.170
There's no room in here.
Give me the camera.

29:27.339 --> 29:29.413
- All set.
- Get a minicam van...

29:29.589 --> 29:32.456
...and meet me at County. Here, here.

29:33.047 --> 29:35.168
Close the door. Let's go!

29:43.755 --> 29:46.325
Patch your headsets back to the station.

29:46.504 --> 29:49.419
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.

29:51.754 --> 29:54.918
- You're filming this?
- We're live from Chopper Five with Dr...

29:55.087 --> 29:56.912
- What's your name, doctor?
- Doug Ross.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.793
Dr. Doug Ross from County General.

29:58.962 --> 30:02.541
Just minutes ago Dr. Ross rescued
a boy from a storm drain.

30:03.754 --> 30:07.877
I can see you're attaching electrodes
to the boy's chest. What are those for?

30:08.878 --> 30:12.954
- What are those for, Dr. Ross?
- Patch me through to County.

30:13.128 --> 30:16.291
Dr. Ross has just asked me to
patch him through to County General.

30:17.378 --> 30:19.701
- You need a red key.
- Look out for the Lost Soul.

30:19.878 --> 30:22.366
- Use the rocket launcher.
- Mount Sinai's shooting us.

30:22.544 --> 30:25.033
- They're cheaters! Get them!
- You do it!

30:25.211 --> 30:28.872
- I need a bulletproof vest.
- Blast him with a BFG 9000!

30:29.044 --> 30:31.200
Look, his guts are all over the place!

30:31.377 --> 30:34.245
Quiet, you guys.
This is County General. Go ahead.

30:34.419 --> 30:36.575
This is Chopper Five
from Channel Five News.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.915
We've got a Dr. Ross flying in
a hypothermic kid.

30:40.085 --> 30:42.206
- Doug Ross?
- That is correct.

30:42.377 --> 30:45.079
Hold on, Chopper Five.
Mark, Doug is on a news chopper...

30:45.251 --> 30:46.827
...bringing in a hypothermic kid.

30:47.001 --> 30:50.248
- What?
- It's on the MICN.

30:50.418 --> 30:54.411
- What's he doing on a news chopper?
- Look, there's Dr. Ross.

30:54.626 --> 30:56.865
- Turn up the volume.
- Where's the remote?

30:57.043 --> 30:58.416
Doug, do you read me?

30:59.667 --> 31:02.072
- Mark, is that you?
- What are you doing?

31:02.251 --> 31:05.035
I got a 12-year-old with hypothermia.
I gotta warm him up.

31:05.209 --> 31:07.911
- I'm doing my best. What's our ETA?
- About three minutes.

31:08.084 --> 31:10.453
Seeing a rescue in action,
live from Chopper Five.

31:10.625 --> 31:13.991
Stay with us as Dr. Doug Ross
struggles to save the life of this child.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.825
What are you doing?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.618
How's he doing?
How's he doing, doctor?

31:21.791 --> 31:26.365
Malik, we need heated saline IVs.
Warm up half a dozen to 106 degrees.

31:26.541 --> 31:29.243
Wendy, get heated blankets
and a mattress.

31:29.416 --> 31:31.620
Jerry, tell Benton we may need him
down here.

31:31.791 --> 31:35.238
- Heated peritoneal lavage?
- Yeah, that's right. Come on, let's go!

31:35.416 --> 31:38.781
Can you warm him up now?
How's he doing, doctor?

31:40.249 --> 31:44.289
- Why's the monitor doing that?
- He's got runs of abnormal heartbeats.

31:45.498 --> 31:48.994
- What are you doing?
- Trying to stabilize his rhythm.

31:49.665 --> 31:52.616
Come on. He's in V-fib!

31:53.498 --> 31:56.496
- Come on.
- What are those paddles for, Dr. Ross?

31:56.664 --> 31:59.070
Stabilize his beat.
They didn't charge the battery!

31:59.248 --> 32:01.783
- Oh, my God.
- God!

32:01.956 --> 32:04.444
I need your help. Turn the camera off.

32:05.039 --> 32:07.113
Turn off the camera!

32:08.372 --> 32:11.204
We've momentarily lost contact
with Chopper Five.

32:11.372 --> 32:13.612
This is Warner Saunders,
with Rescue in Action.

32:13.789 --> 32:16.075
Squeeze the bag when I count to five.

32:16.247 --> 32:19.031
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Like this?

32:19.205 --> 32:22.736
Y eah. One, two, three, four, five.

32:22.913 --> 32:25.580
One, two...
We're gonna lose this. God!

32:25.746 --> 32:27.820
Three, four, five.

32:27.996 --> 32:31.113
Mark? Mark, where are you?
Where the hell's County?

32:31.371 --> 32:33.527
- You told me to turn it off.
- Get County.

32:33.704 --> 32:36.655
Tell them we need a crash cart
on the roof, now.

32:36.829 --> 32:40.277
- Come on. How far out are we?
- I can see it.

32:41.329 --> 32:44.824
Keep bagging him.
Squeeze it like that. Like that.

32:46.079 --> 32:49.444
For you, Dr. Greene.
It's Morgenstern.

32:49.620 --> 32:54.407
Yeah, I did think it was kind of risky.
No, we're watching Channel Five.

32:54.578 --> 32:56.734
They're trashing us on Channel Eight.

32:56.911 --> 33:01.450
Listen, you do not need to come in.
Everything is under control.

33:02.453 --> 33:06.281
We have an unconfirmed report that
resuscitation efforts may have failed.

33:06.453 --> 33:09.486
It's always a danger up there
in that copter in the Windy City.

33:09.661 --> 33:12.493
In a child with hypothermia,
it can cause fatal arrhythmia.

33:12.661 --> 33:14.070
She's right outside.

33:14.244 --> 33:16.946
- Jerry, turn that off.
- TV doctors...

33:17.119 --> 33:21.491
Get Security to escort Dr. Mahoney
to a less conspicuous place.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.900
Let's get the life pack and drug box.

33:24.327 --> 33:27.858
- Any sixes?
- Nope. Go fish.

33:29.243 --> 33:33.237
- How are you doing?
- My stomach hurts a little bit.

33:38.118 --> 33:42.158
Get a CTof her abdomen along with
the head. Probably just a bruise.

33:42.326 --> 33:44.151
- Where are her parents?
- Coffee shop.

33:44.326 --> 33:45.569
I get next game, okay?

33:47.742 --> 33:51.321
- Coming through. Coming through.
- Doctor, is he dead?

33:51.492 --> 33:53.482
- Please, get out of the way.
- Dr. Greene...

33:53.658 --> 33:55.649
...can you confirm
or deny this report?

33:55.825 --> 33:58.657
Get Security to get these people
into the Press Room.

33:58.825 --> 34:01.739
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision
to fly the child here?

34:01.908 --> 34:04.194
- Not for a second.
- Come on! Move, now!

34:15.782 --> 34:17.489
Let's go!

34:19.407 --> 34:21.030
Hurry!

34:22.739 --> 34:24.612
We're ready.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.071
Move it! He's hypoxic.

34:29.032 --> 34:31.152
All right, let's move!

34:31.322 --> 34:34.902
- Clear the blades and we'll shock him.
- Where's the crash cart?

34:41.781 --> 34:45.821
- All right, the paddles.
- We just landed at County General.

34:45.989 --> 34:48.857
- The doctors are taking out paddles.
- Charging!

34:49.031 --> 34:50.487
- Clear!
- One hundred!

34:50.656 --> 34:53.938
Several doctors are trying desperately
to revive Ben Larkin.

34:54.114 --> 34:55.487
- One-fifty.
- Clear!

34:55.697 --> 34:58.611
- So far their efforts are failing.
-0.4 epi.

34:58.780 --> 35:01.612
- Charging 200.
- Clear.

35:01.780 --> 35:04.861
- Will he make it?
- Shock him again!

35:05.030 --> 35:06.439
One more time.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.358
- Charging 200.
- Back.

35:11.446 --> 35:15.107
- Let's get him inside. We'll try it again.
- Are we gonna lose him?

35:15.321 --> 35:18.153
- Got warming blankets?
- We're all set.

35:22.862 --> 35:24.355
Damn.

35:31.445 --> 35:34.645
We'll shock him again,
then we'll try rapid rewarming.

35:35.862 --> 35:38.564
- Get that gurney out of there!
- That little girl?

35:38.736 --> 35:41.900
Molly! She crashed in CT. Pressure
dropped. Now she's unconscious.

35:42.070 --> 35:45.435
- Said her stomach hurt.
- Could've blown a mesenteric clot.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.981
Harper, get four units O-neg.

35:48.153 --> 35:51.103
Stay with us, Ben. Paddles. Paddles!

35:52.111 --> 35:53.936
Charging 200.

35:56.277 --> 35:57.604
Clear.

35:58.610 --> 36:00.269
Charging 300.

36:00.944 --> 36:02.271
Clear.

36:04.818 --> 36:07.058
- I got a faint pulse.
- Pulse ox is 80.

36:07.235 --> 36:09.854
He's hypoxic.
Let's change him over to a Shiley.

36:10.026 --> 36:13.108
Dr. Greene, the press is going berserk.
They want a statement.

36:13.276 --> 36:16.274
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.

36:16.443 --> 36:17.770
Right.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.692
Let's get a CBC, lytes,
blood gas and coags.

36:20.859 --> 36:23.561
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.

36:23.734 --> 36:27.395
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.558
Heated saline.

36:29.734 --> 36:33.810
Let's start him on lidocaine,
0.8 mgs per minute.

36:33.984 --> 36:36.519
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.

36:37.525 --> 36:40.807
Doug, you're a mess.
Go change into some scrubs.

36:42.775 --> 36:45.393
You're freezing, Doug.
Go get some coffee and warm up.

36:49.608 --> 36:52.274
Hey, I need you here. Go change!

36:52.441 --> 36:55.604
I should never have put him
on the damn chopper!

36:57.399 --> 36:59.473
- Got it, Carter?
- I'm almost in.

36:59.649 --> 37:01.935
- Got the O-neg.
- Hang it.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.852
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- Get her out of here!

37:06.024 --> 37:09.223
- Somebody call my husband!
- We think Molly has internal bleeding...

37:09.398 --> 37:10.891
...from the accident.

37:11.065 --> 37:14.146
- Molly!
- Somebody get her out of here! Now!

37:14.315 --> 37:16.981
No! Molly! No, please!

37:17.148 --> 37:19.897
- Give me some suction.
- My God. No!

37:24.439 --> 37:26.595
Number five ETtube, please.

37:36.064 --> 37:37.391
- It's in.
- Bag her!

37:38.105 --> 37:41.103
Give her 0.3 of epi
and 0.6 of atropine. Now!

37:42.230 --> 37:44.801
Come on, Molly. Come on, Molly.

37:47.938 --> 37:49.479
Epi's in.

37:52.063 --> 37:54.551
Dr. Ross! He saved Ben.

37:54.729 --> 37:56.886
- We're his parents. How is he?
- It's too soon.

37:57.063 --> 37:59.432
- The news said his heart stopped.
- It's going now.

37:59.604 --> 38:02.093
- How's he doing?
- Coag looks good. Lytes are normal.

38:02.271 --> 38:04.841
- Blood pH 7.37.
- Thank God for small miracles.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.390
- How's the patient?
- He hasn't gone into DIC.

38:07.562 --> 38:09.387
There are reporters crawling all over.

38:09.562 --> 38:11.387
- What's his temp?
- Eighty-five degrees.

38:11.562 --> 38:14.050
- He's not warming up enough.
- Heated pleural lavage?

38:14.228 --> 38:18.222
His heart won't take it. We could
bypass him and warm his blood directly.

38:18.395 --> 38:21.891
- That'd be fastest. What do you think?
- You're the Attending.

38:22.061 --> 38:26.765
Call Cardiac Surgery for a perfusionist
with a bypass pump and a heating unit.

38:26.936 --> 38:28.263
Lily, go get Benton.

38:32.103 --> 38:35.349
- Mark needs you for bypass access.
- Got to stop the bleeding first.

38:35.519 --> 38:37.924
Thoracotomy tray. Now!

38:43.019 --> 38:45.341
- We'll go to the waiting room.
- No, I wanna stay.

38:45.519 --> 38:48.267
No, we have to go. Come on. Come on.

38:50.227 --> 38:51.885
Ten blade.

38:54.435 --> 38:55.975
Retractor.

38:56.143 --> 39:00.302
Carter, start compressions
while I cross-clamp the aorta.

39:00.476 --> 39:02.182
Yeah, I got it.

39:03.309 --> 39:05.051
- She's clamped.
- What happened?

39:05.226 --> 39:08.058
- Abdominal bleed. She coded.
- Start an atrial line.

39:08.226 --> 39:13.048
- I need two 15 French cannulas.
- Mark, little girl's coding in 2.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.089
Hit-and-run,
recent onset of abdominal pain.

39:18.267 --> 39:20.056
Crashed and went into asystole.

39:20.225 --> 39:23.342
We've infused four units of O-neg
and epi and cross-clamped her.

39:23.517 --> 39:26.633
- Mesenteric rupture?
- Probably. Nothing you could've done.

39:26.808 --> 39:29.806
Peter, I'll take over.
Hypothermic kid in Trauma 1.

39:29.975 --> 39:34.217
Needs femoral lines for a bypass.
Infuse another unit.

39:34.391 --> 39:37.638
- Peter, it's about damn time!
- Cut down!

39:47.599 --> 39:49.222
We're trying internal paddles.

39:49.390 --> 39:50.883
- Charge to 10.
- Charging.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.097
Clear.

39:54.807 --> 39:56.880
- Charge 20.
- Charging.

39:58.223 --> 39:59.846
Clear.

40:00.723 --> 40:02.132
- Twenty again.
- Charging.

40:03.473 --> 40:04.717
Clear.

40:05.473 --> 40:09.134
When I remove the obturator, be ready
to hook up the cannula to the bypass.

40:09.306 --> 40:11.012
- What's his temperature?
- Eighty-six.

40:11.181 --> 40:14.676
- He's going into V-tach. Rate's 180.
- Give me 100 procainamide.

40:14.889 --> 40:17.591
Come on, Ben. You can make it.

40:17.764 --> 40:21.259
Hold on, buddy. Hold on!

40:34.180 --> 40:37.094
Time of death, 2125.

40:55.179 --> 40:57.632
I'll go talk to her folks.

41:25.010 --> 41:26.633
Doug?

41:26.802 --> 41:28.958
Doug, your friend's awake.

41:29.135 --> 41:30.462
Hey.

41:32.260 --> 41:33.753
Hey.

41:36.885 --> 41:40.629
You're in a hospital. Don't try and talk.

41:43.801 --> 41:46.834
- Doug?
- He made it.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.461
- Pretty nasty cut.
- Yeah.

41:54.634 --> 41:58.544
- Could probably use a few stitches.
- I'll do that in a little while.

42:00.925 --> 42:04.125
- What's his temperature?
- Ninety-three. Vitals stable.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.627
Ninety-three. Way to go.

42:06.258 --> 42:08.379
You made it. How about that, kiddo?

42:23.674 --> 42:27.502
Excuse me. Are you the parents
of the little boy in the tunnel?

42:27.674 --> 42:30.423
How does it feel to know
that Mercy was three minutes-?

42:30.590 --> 42:32.498
Excuse me. I think you'd better leave.

42:32.674 --> 42:34.463
Sorry, I'm talking with these people.

42:34.632 --> 42:36.208
No, you're not.

42:52.048 --> 42:55.164
Hey, how are you feeling?

42:57.464 --> 43:00.035
- You made it.
- Just like you promised.

43:04.005 --> 43:07.003
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

43:09.088 --> 43:11.541
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.

43:17.046 --> 43:19.167
Sit down. Let me finish.

43:21.213 --> 43:24.376
- That one was crooked.
- Yeah? Next time you can do it yourself.

43:27.879 --> 43:32.204
- Hey, Mark, thanks.
- For what? You did all the hard work.

43:33.879 --> 43:36.746
I don't think I could've gone up
in that helicopter.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.247
I just got lucky.

43:39.128 --> 43:42.210
No. You know about kids.

43:46.336 --> 43:47.829
As good as new.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.668
- Where are you going?
- Check for reporters.

43:53.503 --> 43:54.995
All clear.

44:01.586 --> 44:04.832
- Get some sleep.
- My car's in Grant Park with a flat.

44:05.002 --> 44:07.953
We'll pick it up tomorrow.
I'll grab you a cab. Come on.

44:08.127 --> 44:10.829
- Guess I missed the opera.
- Linda will understand.

44:11.002 --> 44:13.123
- Here, take my coat.
- Thanks.

44:13.293 --> 44:15.165
- Grab a bite?
- Yeah.

44:17.460 --> 44:19.913
- Oh, there he is.
- Dr. Ross! Dr. Ross!

44:20.085 --> 44:23.166
- Over here, Dr. Ross.
- Can we have a statement, Dr. Ross?

44:23.335 --> 44:27.410
- How are you feeling right now?
- Have you seen the rescue footage?

44:30.376 --> 44:34.037
- How does it feel to be a hero?
- Just a moment of your time.

44:34.209 --> 44:37.118
Dr. Ross, just a moment of your time.
