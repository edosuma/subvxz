09:24.481 --> 09:26.233
How did you drag me out
to this?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.609
You  always try
to avoid them.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.946
Usually, but this is one
you needed to make.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.114
My boss is here,

09:32.114 --> 09:34.700
and he's got a book
with a redacted chapter

09:34.700 --> 09:36.284
that you'll be interested in.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.703
Come here.

09:37.703 --> 09:38.954
Albus.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.665
I wanted you to meet
my friend, Kate Sacker.

09:41.665 --> 09:45.293
We were in Tiger, in together.
And she's a voracious reader.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.671
Hello there. [chuckles]

09:46.671 --> 09:49.089
What brings you to this haven
of words and wine?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.216
Oh, just the chance to meet
erudite gentlemen

09:51.216 --> 09:53.760
and learn from them.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.095
[indistinct conversations]

09:55.095 --> 09:58.390
[printer whirring]

09:58.390 --> 10:00.684
There is nothing illegal
in here, nothing actionable,

10:00.684 --> 10:01.977
but fuck.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.521
A guy who has so much

10:04.521 --> 10:06.982
of his public reputation
built on 9/11.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.233
-[Bryan] It's...
[door opens]

10:11.570 --> 10:14.031
[door closes]
-Okay, if this is about Axelrod,

10:14.031 --> 10:15.783
I can't be here.
Why'd you text me?

10:15.783 --> 10:19.619
[Kate] You just need to read
this thing I found.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.912
It'll make your day.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.748
Tell me.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.417
The reason Axe wasn't
in the Towers on 9/11

10:25.417 --> 10:27.461
with the rest
of his company

10:27.461 --> 10:29.839
was because he was at
his attorney's office

10:29.839 --> 10:31.590
going over
his severance package.

10:33.718 --> 10:37.804
That's what's great about you,
Sacker. Always ears out.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.473
So they were brooming him?

10:39.473 --> 10:40.807
[Bryan] Big-time.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.769
Partners thought his trades were
over the line, maybe illegal.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.230
9/11 -- their deaths --
saved his career.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.815
It allowed him
to take over the firm,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.317
rename it for himself.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.943
[Bryan] And it gets worse.
Listen to this...

10:51.943 --> 10:53.904
"Bobby claims that he was
supporting the rescue efforts

10:53.904 --> 10:57.491
on 9/11, but like
everything else in his life,

10:57.491 --> 11:00.035
this is a lie. Because after
the dust settled..."

11:00.035 --> 11:01.870
-[sighs]
-"...the whispers began.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.206
But by the time
the New York markets reopened,

11:04.206 --> 11:06.792
Bobby was hundreds of millions
of dollars richer."

11:06.792 --> 11:08.794
[papers thud]

11:08.794 --> 11:10.337
If this gets out --

11:10.337 --> 11:13.799
I will have nothing
to do with this. No.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.550
Nor will I leak it.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.553
â™ª tense music â™ª

11:20.388 --> 11:21.723
[door closes]

11:21.723 --> 11:23.350
Did he just tell us
to leak it?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.435
How could he?
He was never even here.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.939
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

11:28.939 --> 11:30.816
[door opens]

11:34.194 --> 11:36.988
[door closes]

11:36.988 --> 11:39.074
Who should we give it to?
[sighs]

11:40.575 --> 11:42.285
[files thud]

11:42.285 --> 11:43.746
Sacker has a friend
at the Times,

11:43.746 --> 11:44.914
but someone might
figure that out.

11:44.914 --> 11:46.289
Dimonda.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.416
Dimonda? He's torched us
twice already.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.835
You're gonna reward that?

11:49.835 --> 11:52.003
Yes, I am.
I'll give it to him.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.839
He understands contract.

11:53.839 --> 11:55.757
He'll know the value
of what we're bringing him.

11:55.757 --> 11:56.883
And he'll  reward it.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.844
It's not just about
this story.

11:58.844 --> 12:01.012
It's about the next one,
the one after that.

12:01.012 --> 12:04.099
And he's not Axe's guy anymore.
He's our  guy.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.725
Hmm.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.187
[footsteps depart]

12:09.187 --> 12:10.355
[door opens]

12:10.355 --> 12:12.691
Hey. This came for you.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.735
What's up?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.822
[scoffs]

12:18.822 --> 12:20.323
[envelope rustles]

12:20.323 --> 12:24.494
Hall called yesterday
with some distressing news.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.954
US attorneys pulled in
an informant

12:25.954 --> 12:27.289
in the middle
of the night.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.498
He doesn't have a name,

12:28.498 --> 12:30.292
but he knows he works here
at Axe Capital.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.295
What the fuck?
You sat on this for half a day?

12:33.295 --> 12:34.797
What should I have done?

12:34.797 --> 12:36.756
Fire everyone, right now,
including me.

12:36.756 --> 12:41.887
Wags, if it's you,
you got me.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.763
I am  gonna fire somebody,
though.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.432
That's for fucking  certain.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.059
-Who?
-The informant.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.853
Do you know who it is?

12:49.853 --> 12:52.063
I will.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.481
â™ª dramatic music â™ª

12:53.481 --> 12:56.276
[telephone ringing in distance]

12:56.276 --> 12:59.738
Put your phones down!
Put your phones down!

12:59.738 --> 13:00.739
[receivers thud]

13:00.739 --> 13:02.157
Everybody, right now!

13:02.157 --> 13:03.909
[Mafee] Bid 71 the figure.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.493
-Fifty half a hundred.
-[man] Put it in.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.162
Like, right now.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.914
Who are you talking to?

13:08.914 --> 13:10.081
-Uh, nobody.
[cord clatters]

13:10.081 --> 13:11.958
Our -- our --
our sales monkey at Morgan.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.586
-Let me see your phone.
[receiver clatters]

13:14.586 --> 13:16.713
Not that phone!
Not your work phone!

13:16.713 --> 13:18.048
[phone clatters, thuds]

13:18.048 --> 13:19.382
Your real phone!

13:19.382 --> 13:21.384
[whispers] Ah, here.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.677
[touchscreen clicks]

13:22.677 --> 13:24.346
This is an offshore number.
What is this?

13:24.346 --> 13:26.264
A-a guy, an analyst.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.683
With a fucking
Antigua country code?

13:28.683 --> 13:30.853
[Mafee] A-all right, it's my
bookie. He's set up offshore.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.520
[Bobby] What's this?
Unmarked?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.940
-I'm calling this right now.
-Don't. Please don't. Don't.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.274
[Mafee] Don't.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.485
Who the fuck
are you talking to?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.989
It's my...my girlfriend
from high school.

13:41.989 --> 13:42.822
[line ringing]

13:42.822 --> 13:44.699
I didn't have the heart
to erase her number.

13:44.699 --> 13:48.203
She's...she's so sweet.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.496
And chesty.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.206
[line rings]
-J--

13:51.206 --> 13:53.625
[woman sighs]
You have to stop calling me.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.168
[cellphone thuds]

13:55.168 --> 13:58.505
Everyone here is on notice.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.591
Everything you do
will be picked apart

14:01.591 --> 14:03.928
until I discover
who is on the level

14:03.928 --> 14:06.137
and who's a fucking quisling!

14:06.137 --> 14:09.140
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

14:12.769 --> 14:15.940
[under breath] That should
get the rat scurrying.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.899
[exhales]

What the fuck
is a quisling?

Turncoat.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.739
Shit!

14:24.739 --> 14:26.533
I knew it didn't
sound good.

[machines whirring,

14:29.119 --> 14:30.787
[telephone ringing]

14:30.787 --> 14:33.081
Hey. Congrats on
getting the book.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.000
Really fucking awesome.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.086
Thanks.

14:37.086 --> 14:39.922
Come out with me tonight.
We should celebrate.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.340
Is this a superior
taking out a subordinate

14:42.340 --> 14:44.051
for a job well done?

14:44.051 --> 14:45.969
Uh, yeah, I guess.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.762
Love to,

14:47.762 --> 14:49.932
but I have, uh, dinner plans.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.099
My parents.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.767
I see.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.102
Come along.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.025
The wire at Axe Cap is humming.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.276
What?

15:01.276 --> 15:03.820
Axelrod went full Captain Queeg
on a trader.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.947
He's launching a mole hunt.

15:04.947 --> 15:05.947
I don't know if he knows
something

15:05.947 --> 15:07.782
or if he's just paranoid,
but our man's in trouble.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.409
Shit.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.371
[footsteps depart]

15:13.371 --> 15:15.206
You've got a problem.

15:15.206 --> 15:18.002
[mouth full]
He'll smoke out your guy.

15:18.002 --> 15:21.088
Bury the SEC file on that
Rubinex trade he got pinged on.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.423
Spyros's office is
a fucking sieve.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.925
Axelrod's probably got
a leg in there right now,

15:25.925 --> 15:29.220
looking for anything open
on his people, so...

15:29.220 --> 15:31.848
I will.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.726

It's fucking mall food.

[mouth full] What?
It's good. Vegetarian.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.110
Yeah, you think
it keeps you thin.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.156
Well, at least put some kimchi
on it, for fuck's sake.

15:47.156 --> 15:48.365
-Come on.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.834
You know, you still
have a problem.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.961
[mouth full]
If he's looking for a mole,

16:01.961 --> 16:05.215
he's not gonna stop
until he's got a mole.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.175
So you gotta give him
a mole.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.552
You want me
to take some schmuck

16:09.552 --> 16:11.179
and start talking to him,

16:11.179 --> 16:13.932
make him look
like he's the informant?

16:13.932 --> 16:16.018
Frame an innocent guy,
get him fired, ruined?

16:16.018 --> 16:19.312
No. You  want to.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.980
I'm just telling you how.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.234
[Lara] A Michelin star.

16:24.234 --> 16:27.862
-[man] Whoo!
[applause]

16:27.862 --> 16:30.657
I could not be more proud
of our family.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.243
And, of course, we have to
single out one member.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.994
'Cause when you get that star,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.747
it means you have
a world-class chef.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.999
This one just happens
to be my baby sister.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.876
So let's raise a glass

16:41.876 --> 16:44.171
to the woman who made this
all possible --

16:44.171 --> 16:45.255
Lu.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.840
-Whoo!
-To Lu!

16:46.840 --> 16:48.133
-[all] Whoo!

they been hanging out?

[birds chirping]

17:04.649 --> 17:06.067
Past three days.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.237
Are they in uniform?

17:08.237 --> 17:09.404
No, but they're
watching the farm

17:09.404 --> 17:11.448
like they're undercover
or something.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.784
I don't know.
Maybe cops. Maybe miga.

to duck compliance.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.426
Forward the e-mails to me.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.844
These guys are, uh, saying

17:32.844 --> 17:35.097
some pretty terrible things
about you in them.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.348
Of course they are.
I'm their boss.

Who wrote that?

18:01.498 --> 18:03.333
No. Don't tell me.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.752
I already know
from the syntax.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.045
What do they say
about Wags?

18:07.045 --> 18:09.672
No. No way.
I'm not like you.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.132
I can't hear it.
It would break me.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.800
-[chuckles]
-Well, uh, I'll say one thing.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.761
People are scared.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.179
Three people deleted
their hard drives

18:16.179 --> 18:17.680
and overwrote them
with new data.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.183
Is there a reason
to do that?

18:19.183 --> 18:22.227
Yeah, to intentionally make
the files unrecoverable.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.020
Who?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.104
-Um...
[taps key]

18:25.104 --> 18:28.233
Channing Feldt.
Butch Probert.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.400
-The Pouch?
-The Pouch?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.154
And, uh, Donnie Caan.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.239
[inhales deeply]

18:34.239 --> 18:35.990
[exhales]

18:35.990 --> 18:39.160
If this is what you say it is
and I can verify it,

18:39.160 --> 18:40.620
we are in a whole new place,
Chuck.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.038
Well, that's why
I brought it to you.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.207
Chase down what he did
after the first plane hit.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.834
-The implications --
-I understand the implication.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.254
Right. What are you
eating there, cabbage?

18:49.254 --> 18:50.838
Yeah. Goi ba.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.341
-Uh-huh.
-Delicious. [slurps]

18:53.341 --> 18:55.552
[mouth full] You know, there's
more to bahn mi than bread.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.387
If you say so. [sniffs]

18:57.387 --> 18:59.305
[mouth full] Just so you know,
if you're playing me,

18:59.305 --> 19:01.266
and this story doesn't make,
I swear to God --

19:01.266 --> 19:02.892
I'm not.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.187
Fact-check it, run it,
and you'll see

19:05.187 --> 19:07.814
you're not the only one
who understands contract.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.817
[horns honking in distance]

19:12.944 --> 19:15.196
[Winnie] Thank you so much
for joining us, Bryan.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.740
-[Winnie] We're honored.
-It's my honor.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.284
From how our daughter
described you,

19:19.284 --> 19:21.286
I figured you'd blow it off.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.787
I'm a businessman, after all.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.372
[laughs]

19:24.372 --> 19:27.292
I don't hate business.
I hate criminals.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.793
I can see the difference.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.795
Most civil servants can't,

19:30.795 --> 19:32.338
which is what they use
to justify

19:32.338 --> 19:34.257
their own
less-than-scrupulous behavior.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.217
[exhales] Whoa.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.385
[imitates Boston accent]
Shots fired.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.012
Uh, I don't think
we're the ones --

19:39.012 --> 19:40.179
[normal voice]
Don't take the bait, Bryan.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.389
[Franklin]
No, no. He already has.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.392
Are you saying you
don't occasionally give in

19:43.392 --> 19:44.934
to the impetus to get down
in the gutter

19:44.934 --> 19:47.228
and brawl no-holds-barred style?

19:47.228 --> 19:49.564
Uh, I might've shown him
the manuscript,

19:49.564 --> 19:52.275
told him the sitch.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.818
Why would you show him --

19:53.818 --> 19:56.280
I...uh...

19:56.280 --> 19:57.447
I tell my dad everything.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.116
And when I brought that book
home, I needed some advice.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.035
I knew what would happen
with it,

20:02.035 --> 20:06.290
and I didn't know if I could
or should  be involved in that.

20:06.290 --> 20:08.958
And he convinced me
to bring it in.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.335
Thanks for setting her
straight.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.588
I advised her it was her duty
to share it with her superiors,

20:13.588 --> 20:16.174
even if something unethical
might happen with it after.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.717
-Unethical?
-Dad...

20:17.717 --> 20:20.011
Maybe it's inevitable
that Axelrod's darkest secrets

20:20.011 --> 20:21.346
will be made public.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.805
Inevitability is

20:22.805 --> 20:25.392
a problematic moral
justification for anything.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.517
Look, Mr. Sacker...

20:26.517 --> 20:28.437
Call me Frank.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.314
Frank...

20:30.314 --> 20:33.900
I've accepted
certain realities.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.443
Doing bad to do good.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.488
Nothing you say could
convince me that's all right.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.908
No. We need to fight back.
Think of it what you will.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.036
Hey, I have responsibilities
beyond niceties.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.622
-Let me ask you one thing.
-[Bryan] Hmm?

20:47.622 --> 20:49.415
How does it make you feel,
Bryan?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.001
You know, when I was young,
I would've done the same thing.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.755
Not anymore. Sleeping well
has become important to me.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.507
So is looking my daughter
in the eye,

20:57.507 --> 21:00.301
knowing she's looking back
at a good person.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.345
Principle doesn't usually
go away all at once.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.889
It's a, uh, creeping erosion.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.850
[jazz music playing
over speakers]

21:07.850 --> 21:09.602
[Bobby] A Michelin star.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.728
Well,
it was a great moment.

21:10.728 --> 21:11.896
[glasses clink]

21:15.359 --> 21:17.777
That's not a real smile.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.488
[sips]

21:20.697 --> 21:22.115
[sets down glass]

21:22.115 --> 21:24.283
I had to let Marta
and her family go.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.952
Their papers were forged.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.371
We're going through everyone.
[inhales deeply]

21:28.371 --> 21:31.333
Tito thinks that immigration
agents are watching the farm,

21:31.333 --> 21:32.917
and I think so, too.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.085
You sure?

21:34.085 --> 21:37.505
I saw them, and they're
not local cops.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.885
[glass clatters]

21:42.885 --> 21:44.471
[sighs]

21:47.306 --> 21:49.267
They're Rhoades's people.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.352
FBI.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.230
They've been staking us out
here, too.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.482
They're watching our house?

21:56.482 --> 21:59.318
I didn't know that
they were on you for sure.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.695
I didn't want to alarm you.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.071
Well, please
fucking alarm me.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.573
I need to know
what's going on.

22:03.573 --> 22:04.782
No. Not always.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.034
Not if there's nothing
we can do to change it.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.704
This is the way
things are now.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.289
Didn't the possibility
cross your mind

22:11.289 --> 22:12.331
that they might be
watching us?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.708
Of course.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.168
Well, then you wouldn't have
done anything differently.

22:15.168 --> 22:18.004
-Don't handle me.
-I wasn't. I'm not.

22:18.004 --> 22:21.257
Fuck them. I want you
to live unencumbered.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.050
This is a new reality.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.762
Don't fucking pretend
it isn't.

22:25.762 --> 22:28.515
â™ª tense music â™ª

22:32.977 --> 22:36.898

[sighs]

22:41.319 --> 22:43.613
[door closes]

22:43.613 --> 22:46.450
I thought about it,
what you said.

22:46.450 --> 22:49.952
And you're right. Tactically.
But I can't do it.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.789
I won't frame an innocent man
as our mole.

22:52.789 --> 22:57.461
It's, uh, an...
erosion of principle.

22:57.461 --> 23:00.046
There are no innocent men,

23:00.046 --> 23:02.799
not on Wall Street.
[inhales deeply]

23:02.799 --> 23:06.385
So you won't act
to protect the source?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.137
No. Not -- not this way.

23:09.764 --> 23:13.226
If you don't play back at him,
he'll find the guy.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.395
That's how this is
gonna play out.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.689
Axelrod is gonna be
with your guy in a room,

23:18.689 --> 23:20.525
just the two of them,
sitting there,

23:20.525 --> 23:24.446
and he's gonna be staring
right the fuck  through him.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.155
Maybe by the end of today.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.283
-[inhales deeply]
-[Chuck scoffs]

23:29.283 --> 23:33.830
But you know what?
Maybe it's not my game anymore.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.624
[sighs]

23:35.624 --> 23:38.042
Yeah, maybe it's you young guys,
eating your salads

23:38.042 --> 23:40.419
-and remaking the world.
[pats shoulder]

23:40.419 --> 23:44.173
No, I know how to win.
But, uh...

23:44.173 --> 23:46.425
if that's not
what it is anymore,

23:46.425 --> 23:49.262
then, uh...

23:49.262 --> 23:51.097
you do it your way, Bryan.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.808
Okay, I will.

23:55.810 --> 23:56.936
[door opens]

24:01.274 --> 24:02.733
[door closes]

24:09.490 --> 24:12.034
Donna, what days a week
is Adam DeGiulio in New York?

24:12.034 --> 24:13.662
Uh, Wednesdays, I believe.

24:13.662 --> 24:16.622
Good. Get me on his schedule
for breakfast in my office.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.749
I don't think he eats
breakfast.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.960
Well, then, whatever it is
he does in the mornings.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.505
And get this...

24:23.505 --> 24:26.132
ball chair outta here.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.885
[indistinct conversations]

24:28.885 --> 24:31.470
What's up with
the meditation room?

24:31.470 --> 24:32.847
I asked one of the workmen.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.975
Axe is having it reinforced
into a panic room

24:35.975 --> 24:37.977
in case of a fucking attack.

24:37.977 --> 24:41.063
Who does he think's
gonna attack?

[footsteps approach]

24:42.565 --> 24:44.568
[telephone ringing in distance]

24:44.568 --> 24:47.612
Donnie. Axe wants you in
the conference room right now.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.238
Well, we don't have
anything scheduled.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.781
Good.

24:50.781 --> 24:54.452
He didn't want to give you
the chance to prepare.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.178

overnight.

The Scarsdale payroll fraud.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.643
Give that to Cook.

Yes, sir.

then Okin & Cutler.

Five years?

27:33.986 --> 27:35.071
Eight.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.614
I always wanted to work here,
of course,

27:36.614 --> 27:39.492
but I had to get...
[inhales deeply ] set up first.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.660
And when you go back, you go
back to a senior position.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.830
You're a dot-gov lifer,
right?

27:44.830 --> 27:47.751
-Only the monastery for me. Mm.

I gotta confess.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.201
Yeah, you put in
the hours, the years,

29:04.201 --> 29:06.078
to get to a certain point,
then you get there...

29:06.078 --> 29:07.913
[hand thuds]
-and, uh... [chuckles]

29:07.913 --> 29:10.332
Not everything
you want it to be.

29:10.332 --> 29:13.377
Nothing ever is,
but, uh...

29:13.377 --> 29:14.921
[inhales deeply]

29:14.921 --> 29:19.758
You ever feel like you're
on the cusp of a great triumph,

29:19.758 --> 29:22.887
and then you just wanna
give it all up?

29:22.887 --> 29:24.763
Yeah, sure.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.434
And at what point do you enjoy
what you've achieved?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.894
I could be
the fucking president

29:29.894 --> 29:32.563
and still be boxed in
from above and below.

29:32.563 --> 29:35.649
Bobby Axelrod...

29:35.649 --> 29:37.401
could run through
the Serengeti

29:37.401 --> 29:40.154
and not break a sweat.

29:40.154 --> 29:43.782
I go down in the subway,
I gotta change my shirt.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.327
You do what you do
just as well as him.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.786
Maybe better.

29:49.914 --> 29:52.499
I wanna test the waters
in a private firm.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.835
[inhales deeply]

29:54.835 --> 29:57.671
-Really?
-Mm. [exhales]

29:57.671 --> 29:59.883
Oh, Chuck. You -- you --
you gotta let me do it.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.718
You gotta let me
be the one to set it up.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.178
They all want you.
You'll cash in.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.804
Let me wheel you
into three places

30:05.804 --> 30:07.097
and get the bidding war
started.

30:07.097 --> 30:09.433
Mm, no. Just one.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.644
-Horvath.
-Of course.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.479
The best Supreme Court
litigator.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.023
Big here and in Washington.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.899
Get me a meeting at Horvath.
Keep it confidential.

30:16.899 --> 30:18.442
You say where and when.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.697
[crickets chirping]

30:23.697 --> 30:25.699
[engine revving]

30:34.375 --> 30:35.626
[engine revs]

30:35.626 --> 30:37.002
[lock clicks]

30:41.882 --> 30:44.426
[keys jangle]

30:44.426 --> 30:47.763
How did you know
I was being followed?

30:47.763 --> 30:51.893
Oh, right.
You're watching Axe Capital.

30:51.893 --> 30:52.935
Out of the three of us,

30:52.935 --> 30:55.437
Pouch always plays on
the straight and narrow.

30:55.437 --> 30:57.064
For fuck's sake,
they glossed him "Pouch"

30:57.064 --> 30:58.649
because he's got no balls.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.318
They say he has a vagina.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.821
Wonderful. What else?

31:03.821 --> 31:05.698
Look, if Axe doesn't
trust me anymore,

31:05.698 --> 31:08.034
he might give the Kemlot trade
to someone else.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.576
[glass clatters]
-Don't let him.

31:09.576 --> 31:13.289
Get the trade, make the trade,
testify, and we're done.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.916
Testify? You never said --

31:14.916 --> 31:17.126
There's a thing called
the Constitution.

31:17.126 --> 31:19.712
Sixth Amendment,
Confrontation Clause.

31:19.712 --> 31:23.091
â™ª tense music â™ª

31:23.091 --> 31:25.551
You have a right
in this country

31:25.551 --> 31:26.885
to cross-examine
your accuser.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.846
It's not enough that you
tell us what the tapes mean.

31:28.846 --> 31:30.139
You gotta say it in court.

31:30.139 --> 31:32.016
I can't even imagine it.

31:32.016 --> 31:35.561
Axe there in the room
with those Laura Mars eyes.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.229
That's what he's gonna do
tomorrow, too.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.773
Hey, hey, hey.
You'll get through it.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.900
-[groans]
-You'll get through it.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.444
[exhales]

31:47.489 --> 31:50.075
[slurping]

31:50.075 --> 31:53.370
I'll never know why everybody
drinks that Star Wars  shit.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.998
[smacks lips]
To optimize performance.

31:54.998 --> 31:58.667
[sips] Well, you're
certainly high-performance.

31:58.667 --> 32:02.713
-Well, I try to be.
-You...you aren't a "try-er."

32:02.713 --> 32:03.965
You never have been.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.549
Aw, you've been
watching, huh?

32:05.549 --> 32:09.345
[mouth full] Mm-hmm,
as you've watched me.

32:09.345 --> 32:12.723
I was living out in Seattle
doing my first clerkship

32:12.723 --> 32:14.142
on the Ninth Circuit.

32:14.142 --> 32:16.685
And I remember when you got
your first clerkship --

32:16.685 --> 32:19.605
Supreme Court.
A year before me.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.941
Well, clerking for Ginsburg was
the highlight of my career.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.110
I'll tell you something --

32:24.110 --> 32:25.861
for five-one, that woman
can hold her liquor.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.155
-[chuckles]
-That was a hell of a year.

32:28.155 --> 32:31.492
I remember. I thought,
"DeGiulio is flying past me."

32:31.492 --> 32:32.910
Well, it was never
a competition.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.203
We were both just
trying to do good.

32:34.203 --> 32:37.247
You know, I always figured you
for the robes yourself.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.375
Circuit judge.

32:39.375 --> 32:42.544
Maybe even the big one --
Justice Adam DeGiulio.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.089
-Someday. Yeah.
-Hmm.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.882
There's still a romance
to the judicial branch

32:46.882 --> 32:48.967
that certainly transcends

32:48.967 --> 32:51.929
the petty politicking
in the executive.

32:51.929 --> 32:53.931
But I-I don't even see
how I get there now.

32:53.931 --> 32:56.183
I mean, there's no opening
in the offing.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.976
Things change.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.563
Assignments shift.

33:01.563 --> 33:05.151
Ah. Now we get to the reason
for our meeting, don't we?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.027
I was talking about you,

33:07.027 --> 33:09.196
but, uh, yes.

33:09.196 --> 33:13.201
Yeah. Also about
the situation here.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.994
I want to inform you
that Bryan Connerty

33:15.994 --> 33:18.705
is moving off
the Axe Capital prosecution.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.290
His caseload is too heavy.

33:20.290 --> 33:24.044
And Tonelle Burton
has the better skill set.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.671
That's a problem.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.714
The Attorney General and I
signed off on Connerty

33:27.714 --> 33:29.049
in part because of
his integrity.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.467
T. received
the US Attorney's

33:30.467 --> 33:32.261
Award for Excellence
in the Prosecution of Fraud.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.471
I'm sure "T." is as clean
as a baby fawn.

33:34.471 --> 33:35.931
That's not what
this is about.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.308
High-profile case,
Washington watching.

33:38.308 --> 33:40.519
This can't have the appearance
of string-pulling.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.063
You're recused.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.065
I, alone, determine which
attorneys lead investigations

33:44.065 --> 33:46.900
in the Southern District,
Adam, not Washington.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.152
Absolument.

33:48.152 --> 33:51.072
But...if there's
going to be a change,

33:51.072 --> 33:53.991
I think we would change it all
the way to the Eastern District.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.201
It's cleaner.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.165
[slurping]

34:01.165 --> 34:02.916
[exhales]

34:02.916 --> 34:05.211
It was fun reminiscing.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.462
Enjoy your food.

34:06.462 --> 34:09.089
-[chuckles]
[door opens, closes]

34:09.089 --> 34:12.092
I'm looping you in.
I'm having one-on-ones today

34:12.092 --> 34:14.344
with Butch, Channing,
and Donnie.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.013
I'd like you to sit in.

34:16.013 --> 34:17.806
For what purpose?

34:17.806 --> 34:20.184
Create
an atmosphere of truth.

34:20.184 --> 34:22.728
Maybe they'll feel
more comfortable.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.188
You know these guys well.

34:24.188 --> 34:27.149
I'd like your opinion
on what they have to say.

34:27.149 --> 34:30.986
Donnie. My Bryan Doyle.

34:30.986 --> 34:34.282
Would you say
you've done well for me?

34:34.282 --> 34:36.742
Yeah, Axe. I feel good about it.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.161
â™ª tense music â™ª

34:39.161 --> 34:40.829
Tell me about FedEx.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.499
Uh, that's not my sector.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.834
No, somebody saw you in there.

34:45.834 --> 34:48.171
Mailing a package.

34:48.171 --> 34:49.713
Who was it to?

34:49.713 --> 34:54.009
I don't know...
uh, when that was.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.637
Have you ever met anybody
that worked at the FBI?

34:56.637 --> 34:59.348
I mean, just socially.

34:59.348 --> 35:01.975
I...

35:01.975 --> 35:03.310
No, I don't think so.

35:03.310 --> 35:06.188
Excuse me.
Can we talk for a minute?

35:06.188 --> 35:10.234
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:10.234 --> 35:12.569
[sliding door opens,
footsteps depart]

35:12.569 --> 35:17.115
[indistinct conversations]

35:17.115 --> 35:19.076
I'm not gonna sit there
and be your human lie detector.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.453
You weren't looping me in.
You were roping.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.788
It's different.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.414
I'm just asking you
to listen.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.334
You don't have to do
anything.

35:26.334 --> 35:30.629
I won't be used
to legitimize this bullshit.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.591
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:34.591 --> 35:36.176
[under breath] I can't do this.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.762
Can't do it.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.764
Yes, you can.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.266
-He can't hear you.
[computer chirps]

35:43.809 --> 35:45.227
I know that.

35:45.227 --> 35:49.106
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:49.106 --> 35:51.234
Why'd you overwrite
your hard drive?

35:51.234 --> 35:54.403
I don't know. Just thought
you'd want me to.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.654
I do it once a month.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.990
Some of those first quarter
trades last year...

35:57.990 --> 36:00.367
You wanted me to leave
that paper trail?

36:00.367 --> 36:02.703
Tell me about
Morien Sciences.

36:02.703 --> 36:05.747
Morien? Is that biotech?

36:05.747 --> 36:08.334
Solid company.
Could be a monster.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.211
There is no Morien Sciences.
I made it up.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.379
[Bobby] You still
picking your feet

36:12.379 --> 36:14.257
in Poughkeepsie, Channing?

36:14.257 --> 36:15.591
What?

36:15.591 --> 36:17.050
Never mind.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.885
I would never, Axe.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.762
I don't know what my wife
has to do with this.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.639
What about that
Cross-Co. Trucking play, Pouch?

36:22.639 --> 36:24.225
You still have
a problem with it?

36:24.225 --> 36:26.269
Hey, I made my peace with that.

36:26.269 --> 36:27.519
How many helpings of
strawberries

36:27.519 --> 36:28.979
did you have at lunch
last week?

36:28.979 --> 36:31.815
Uh, two. Two.

36:31.815 --> 36:34.610
If they arrested you,
what would you do?

36:34.610 --> 36:38.196
I'd stand up,
like Dollar Bill.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.364
Would you look me
in the eye

36:39.364 --> 36:41.658
and spew lies about me
on the witness stand?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.660
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

36:43.660 --> 36:47.080
How did you respond to
the SEC letter on Rubinex?

36:47.080 --> 36:49.291
I didn't.
I gave it to my lawyer.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.626
I thought you said Rubinex

36:50.626 --> 36:52.628
never raised flags
with the regulators.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.880
It didn't. I'm sorry.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.673
Are we done here?

36:56.673 --> 36:59.343
Yeah, you're done.
Burnt fucking toast.

36:59.343 --> 37:01.219
[headphones thud]

37:03.639 --> 37:05.015
[headphones clatter]

37:08.769 --> 37:11.772
[engine idling]

37:13.357 --> 37:14.900
[horn honks in distance]

37:14.900 --> 37:16.860
[car door closes]

37:16.860 --> 37:19.905
[indistinct conversations,
glasses clinking]

37:23.075 --> 37:25.535
[clinking continues]
-[sighs]

37:25.535 --> 37:29.206
Alex, thanks for coming.
I appreciate your discretion.

37:29.206 --> 37:31.208
-Of course.
-Please.

37:33.294 --> 37:36.672
-[exhales]
-Well...

37:36.672 --> 37:38.799
You probably know
I have standing offers

37:38.799 --> 37:42.177
from a number of firms.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.845
I chose to set
this meeting with you.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.473
We respect that.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.267
Our firm has a lot to offer.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.937
[glass clatters]

37:51.937 --> 37:55.816
Now...I know this is not
about money for you,

37:55.816 --> 37:57.401
but I also know that

37:57.401 --> 38:00.529
your current annual salary,
185,000,

38:00.529 --> 38:03.448
is what you would
make in a week at Horvath.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.076
Hmm.

38:06.076 --> 38:09.705
And what would you expect
from me in exchange?

38:09.705 --> 38:13.667
Your expertise, image,
prestige.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.128
You would never have
a boring day

38:16.128 --> 38:18.964
because you would never have to
do anything you don't wanna do.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.175
If you wanna be a rainmaker,
you can make rain.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.386
If you want to play golf,

38:23.386 --> 38:25.095
you can be on the circuit
every Monday.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.013
Company box
at sporting events,

38:27.013 --> 38:29.099
partner junkets
to the Super Bowl.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.352
Four weeks vacation
every year.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.311
Well, eight if you prefer.

38:33.311 --> 38:37.315
In due time, your name would be
on the firm, of course.

38:37.315 --> 38:41.319
â™ª pensive music â™ª

38:41.319 --> 38:44.322
All you have to do
is say yes.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.033
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

38:47.033 --> 38:48.369
[Hall] We got him.

38:48.369 --> 38:51.663
An investigation
we dug up at the SEC.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.542
He got picked up, leveraged,
turned against you.

will turn against you.

I'm not surprised.

Those things charge
by the hour, right?

39:33.371 --> 39:36.417
I'm running a story on you.
I'm hoping to get a comment.

39:36.417 --> 39:40.545
That's not why you're here.
You could've called.

39:40.545 --> 39:44.467
You're here 'cause you have
something big -- to you.

39:47.177 --> 39:49.304
Something you think
you can hurt me with.

You're in a lawyer's office.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.533
And everyone you work with
sees it happen.

40:09.533 --> 40:11.868
So you call a broker --
Lincoln Chang in Jersey City --

40:11.868 --> 40:13.537
and have him short
aviation stocks

40:13.537 --> 40:15.413

Then US hotels, shipping.

You go against it all.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.670
The second plane hits.

40:21.670 --> 40:24.297
Everyone you work with
is dead.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.817

of dollars.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.360
And you take that money

40:45.360 --> 40:48.989
and the rest of everything
your dead partners had,

40:48.989 --> 40:52.534

41:51.843 --> 41:53.428
Some damning revelations

41:53.428 --> 41:55.847
of a hedge fund giant --
Robert "Bobby" Axelrod.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.307
Just this morning,
the "Financial Journal"

41:57.307 --> 41:59.100
reported that Bobby Axelrod

41:59.100 --> 42:01.311
may have made much
of his considerable fortune

42:01.311 --> 42:04.814
by preying on aviation, hotel,
and shipping companies

42:04.814 --> 42:06.567
when they were most vulnerable,

42:06.567 --> 42:08.944

during those early moments

50:01.082 --> 50:02.208
Ohh.

50:02.208 --> 50:04.086
You wanna know why?

50:04.086 --> 50:06.379
Because of you.

50:06.379 --> 50:09.048
-Me?
-Yeah.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.299
Because you did it.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.260
[blues music playing
over speakers]

50:12.260 --> 50:15.054
And now I know
you're in this for real,

50:15.054 --> 50:18.975
-...for the whole wagon train.
[hand thuds on counter]

50:18.975 --> 50:23.105
And I can count on you
to do what must  be done.

50:24.272 --> 50:27.109
Because without that sense
of mission...

50:29.569 --> 50:31.362
There's no fucking point
doing it.

50:31.362 --> 50:34.157
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

50:34.157 --> 50:35.324
I struggled with it.

50:35.324 --> 50:38.536
I know. [scoffs]

50:38.536 --> 50:40.413
[sighs] You think I don't?

50:40.413 --> 50:43.249
[bottles clink]

50:43.249 --> 50:45.168
You think I'm a whiff
because of that?

50:45.168 --> 50:47.587
No, I  think  I'm  a whiff
because of that.

50:47.587 --> 50:51.382
I think you have decency.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.301
Mm.

50:53.301 --> 50:55.136
[sets down glass]

50:55.136 --> 50:58.097
For me, doing this,

50:58.097 --> 51:02.185
it's about...it's about
making the world better.

51:02.185 --> 51:03.352
-It really is.
-[sips]

51:03.352 --> 51:04.896
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit more fair.

51:04.896 --> 51:09.192
And as clean as that is
in my head, m-my chest...

51:09.192 --> 51:10.443
[exhales sharply]

51:10.443 --> 51:13.196
Out there, the world's
not clean. It's messy.

51:13.196 --> 51:15.364
[laughter,
indistinct conversations]

51:15.364 --> 51:17.283
Now you're sounding
a little whiffy.

51:17.283 --> 51:19.619
[laughs]

51:19.619 --> 51:22.205
[glass thuds]
-Kidding, all right?

51:22.205 --> 51:24.166
-Number three.
-Mm.

51:24.166 --> 51:26.292
And number three
is the best.

51:26.292 --> 51:30.213
Even if he is an honest man,
even if he's the goddamn Pope,

51:30.213 --> 51:33.132
he's working at a dirty shop.

51:33.132 --> 51:37.137
And that was always gonna end,
and it was never gonna end well.

51:37.137 --> 51:38.137
He should know
the fucking risks.

51:38.137 --> 51:40.348
Right. Like he's a...

51:40.348 --> 51:43.226
haberdasher making
uniforms for the Nazis.

51:43.226 --> 51:45.061
Oh, that's a big contract.

51:45.061 --> 51:47.104
Right, but you don't care
if he loses it.

51:47.104 --> 51:50.233
And whoever did the stitching
on those things

51:50.233 --> 51:51.901
probably didn't hate Jews.

51:51.901 --> 51:54.321
Or maybe they were  Jews.
Prison labor.

51:54.321 --> 51:57.199
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

51:57.199 --> 51:59.659
Yeah. Yeah. [sighs]

51:59.659 --> 52:01.203
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

52:01.203 --> 52:02.578
I like number two better.

52:02.578 --> 52:03.996
What was two?

52:03.996 --> 52:05.998
-Fuck the Pouch.
-Fuck the Pouch.

Hey.

52:14.590 --> 52:17.177
Hey. [clears throat]

52:17.177 --> 52:18.303
[chuckles]

52:22.765 --> 52:27.019
I met with Horvath.

52:27.019 --> 52:28.396
Big offer.

52:28.396 --> 52:31.191
Mm. They recognize my worth.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.111
[towel drops]

52:35.111 --> 52:37.446
Felt good.

52:37.446 --> 52:39.366
[clicks teeth]

52:39.366 --> 52:41.158
But I said no.

52:42.618 --> 52:44.078
Good for you.

52:44.078 --> 52:47.915
You knew I'd never take
the job, didn't you?

52:47.915 --> 52:50.293
-[chuckles]
-Hmm?

52:50.293 --> 52:53.338
I did, yeah.
Was it obvious?

52:53.338 --> 52:55.256
Then why the hell did you
make me go through all of that?

52:55.256 --> 52:57.342
You needed to.

52:57.342 --> 53:00.970
You needed to try it on,
feel it.

53:00.970 --> 53:03.265
And my offer to quit, I knew
it'd push you to do it.

53:03.265 --> 53:05.808
Would you really have quit?

53:05.808 --> 53:08.519
Does it matter now?

53:10.272 --> 53:12.982
I really can't stand
you being there, you know.

53:12.982 --> 53:14.984
That's very honest.

53:14.984 --> 53:17.111
[huffs]

53:17.111 --> 53:20.406
Why is it? [scoffs]

53:20.406 --> 53:22.908
Why do I hate it so much?

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

53:37.465 --> 53:41.052

53:54.565 --> 53:55.983
It's not that simple.

53:55.983 --> 53:57.818
I know.

53:57.818 --> 53:59.362
[chuckles]

53:59.362 --> 54:02.156
It's really
fucking complicated.

54:03.949 --> 54:07.412
And you've been with him longer
than you've been with me.

54:07.412 --> 54:08.746
[sighs]

54:08.746 --> 54:11.916
I love you.

54:11.916 --> 54:15.503
I love you, too.

54:15.503 --> 54:18.464
More than anything.

54:22.134 --> 54:23.344

54:27.349 --> 54:31.727
But you and Axe?
Oh, that's something else.

54:31.727 --> 54:34.146
It's weird,

54:34.146 --> 54:38.109
and it's deep,
and I fucking  hate it.

54:38.109 --> 54:41.112
I do. I fucking  hate it.

54:41.112 --> 54:44.031
I know you do.

54:44.031 --> 54:46.367
But you are strong
because of it.

54:46.367 --> 54:47.952
[exhales]

54:47.952 --> 54:51.456
You are stronger than him,
and you will get through it.

54:54.291 --> 54:57.504
Because things are
changing there,

54:57.504 --> 55:00.840
and it can't last like this
much longer.

55:00.840 --> 55:05.094
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

55:05.094 --> 55:06.846

I don't like it out here.

I'm sorry I didn't
warn you first.

55:31.954 --> 55:36.584
I knew what was going on.
We had to put on a show.

55:36.584 --> 55:38.961
But it still rattled
my nerves.

55:38.961 --> 55:42.757
That was the only way I could
convince Rhoades you were legit.

55:42.757 --> 55:44.049
You okay?

55:44.049 --> 55:46.177
Sort of.

give them Kemlot?
