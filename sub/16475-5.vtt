I'm not telling you
that, Jake.

14:41.777 --> 14:42.978
I'm Team Holt,
and there's nothing

14:42.979 --> 14:44.045
you could say
that will change that.

14:44.046 --> 14:45.313
Okay, fine,
then I guess I have

14:45.314 --> 14:47.381
a new best friend,
and his name...

14:47.416 --> 14:48.415
is Bill.

14:48.451 --> 14:50.151
[scoffs]
You're not serious.

14:50.152 --> 14:51.586
He's just a prop
for the heist.

14:51.587 --> 14:53.555
Sure, it started out
that way,

14:53.556 --> 14:55.790
but you know
how these things go,

14:55.791 --> 14:57.392
spending time together,

14:57.393 --> 14:59.227
sharing intimate secrets,

laughing about nothing
in particular.

15:01.130 --> 15:02.396

- Cabbage.

15:02.431 --> 15:03.565
Holt has the plaque.

15:03.566 --> 15:04.833
It's hidden
in the evidence room

15:04.834 --> 15:06.468
in a box marked
"Cold Cases 1972."

15:06.469 --> 15:08.602
Thanks, bud.
We will always be best friends.

I just can't let you

15:38.334 --> 15:39.934
I told Jake everything.

15:39.935 --> 15:41.101
He threatened to replace me,

15:41.137 --> 15:43.405
and I freaked out hard.

15:43.406 --> 15:45.006
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

15:45.007 --> 15:46.708
I knew you would betray me.

15:46.709 --> 15:48.609
That's why I fed you fake Intel.

15:48.644 --> 15:49.711
Both: What?

15:49.712 --> 15:52.614
The plaque was never
in "Cold Cases 1972."

15:52.615 --> 15:54.949
As if I'd just put it
in a box, unattended.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.617
Uh, but you did.

15:56.652 --> 15:57.652
No, I didn't.

15:57.653 --> 15:59.987
Then how do you explain this?

16:00.022 --> 16:01.990
I have no idea.

16:01.991 --> 16:03.151
I put the plaque
in my office.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.367
Wait, what is going on?
We have the plaque.

16:13.402 --> 16:14.835
Yeah, I just got it
out of the vent

16:14.870 --> 16:16.237

- "Heists."

"Dumb."

16:35.124 --> 16:36.890
Are heists dumb?
Of course not.

16:36.926 --> 16:38.193
That was a stupid question.

16:38.194 --> 16:40.895
No, Jake, it's says,
"Heists are dumb."

16:40.896 --> 16:43.081

all: Terry!

16:44.278 --> 16:46.946
The Oscar for best liar

That's not an Oscars category.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.283
Not to be harsh, Sarge,

16:51.319 --> 16:52.919
but you're setting
a terrible example

16:52.920 --> 16:54.387
for your daughters,
and they're gonna grow up

16:54.388 --> 16:55.754
to be total failures.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.224
You take that back.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.359
No, she's right, Jeffords.
Your children are doomed.

I don't know.

I've been working here

17:04.765 --> 17:05.765

17:05.766 --> 17:07.901
Well, actually,
we both fell asleep.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.836
And Jeffords
never woke us up.

17:09.837 --> 17:11.338
Coincidence?

17:11.339 --> 17:12.605
I don't need this.

I don't understand

17:30.524 --> 17:32.425

17:32.426 --> 17:34.627
Nope, it was all me.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.097
Three weeks ago,
Captain Holt asked me

17:37.098 --> 17:38.797
to order a plaque that read,

17:38.833 --> 17:42.068
<i>"The Ultimate
Detective/Genius."</i>

17:42.069 --> 17:44.504
I did it,

riding a dolphin.

- Is that relevant?
- To my life, yes.

Once I had the plaques,
I manipulated Captain Holt

17:52.613 --> 17:55.382
into choosing Boyle
as his partner.

17:55.383 --> 17:58.451
All it took was
six bottles of dish soap.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.653
See, this is what happens

He is helpless without Boyle.

18:08.596 --> 18:10.297

18:10.298 --> 18:12.331
like a greedy little rat.

18:12.366 --> 18:13.365
Easy.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.167
Yes, it was easy.

18:15.202 --> 18:17.537

18:17.538 --> 18:20.106
<i>a "skating accident."</i>

18:20.107 --> 18:22.174
But you knocked out
your two front teeth.

False teeth.

18:23.744 --> 18:25.378
<i>Fake blood.</i>

birthday party
in fourth grade.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.419
Oh, you made sure
I didn't remember that!

18:32.420 --> 18:33.586
It was minute five

18:33.587 --> 18:35.522
of seven minutes in heaven
with Todd Cohen

18:35.523 --> 18:36.623
when he bumped the wall

on my face.

18:48.035 --> 18:49.569

the rest of the heist.

- No.
- Of course not. Go ahead.

18:51.205 --> 18:52.973

18:52.974 --> 18:55.575

by anyone.

18:55.576 --> 18:58.344

- I wore Amy's clothes.

you and your male prostitute.

Bill is not a male prostitute,

19:09.724 --> 19:11.657
No, Amy, it made me invisible.

that I had that power,

19:13.494 --> 19:15.294

19:15.329 --> 19:16.997

to blame Terry,

19:25.006 --> 19:26.272

19:26.273 --> 19:28.474
But how did you know he was
gonna say "heists are dumb"?

19:28.509 --> 19:29.842
Terry says
that about everything.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.243
Everyone should wear
suspenders.

Belts are dumb.

19:32.279 --> 19:33.584
People should swim forward.

Because you wanted to win?

19:47.028 --> 19:49.428
No!
