00:04.833 --> 00:06.767
We've all done things
 we regret.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.400
Some of us more than others.

00:08.433 --> 00:11.133
Aren't you curious
what this guy was up to

00:11.167 --> 00:12.800
three years ago?

00:12.833 --> 00:16.033
ROSSI: It's a Bruchner. 
 What have you gotta do 
 to get a gift like that?

00:16.067 --> 00:19.167
BILLY: You left a book 
 in your room. 
 There was a note inside.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.967
Rossi was right! What was
 he doing during the war?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Get a shot of your friend?

00:24.033 --> 00:26.733
Dominique? That's not
a story, that's a poem.

00:26.767 --> 00:30.133
Where is my bag?
 It was hanging
 on the back of this chair!

00:30.167 --> 00:31.600
Where's the film?

00:31.633 --> 00:33.367
He was only just adopted.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.700
It might be easier for you
 to get him back if you had
 the father's support.

00:36.733 --> 00:40.533
-It's Claude.
-You can't possibly
hate yourself that much.

00:40.567 --> 00:44.000
-I need a place to live.
-I'll ask around.

00:44.033 --> 00:48.200
Fortier.
 Why do I know that name?
 Didn't I meet her last night?

00:48.233 --> 00:51.333
-My mother
 killed that sailor.
 -Does Claude know?

00:51.367 --> 00:54.733
No. Promise me
 he'll never know.

00:55.933 --> 00:58.200
HELEN: You know, 
 it's never sat right with me,

00:58.233 --> 01:00.400
this arrangement between you?

01:00.433 --> 01:01.567
Scissors!

01:01.600 --> 01:04.167
Maybe it's worked 
 because you and your brother

01:04.200 --> 01:06.800
are driven by completely 
 different impulses.

01:11.433 --> 01:13.867
* I love Paris

01:13.900 --> 01:16.433
* In the springtime

01:18.133 --> 01:20.133
* I love Paris

01:20.167 --> 01:23.400
* In the fall

01:24.667 --> 01:26.500
* I love Paris

01:26.533 --> 01:28.067
* In the winter

01:28.067 --> 01:29.533
* When it drizzles

01:30.400 --> 01:32.767
* Say, I love Paris

01:32.800 --> 01:35.467
* In the summer 
 when it sizzles *

01:35.500 --> 01:38.067
* I love Paris

01:38.100 --> 01:41.733
* Why, oh, why 
 do I love Paris? *

01:41.767 --> 01:43.900
* Because my love

01:43.933 --> 01:45.500
* Is near

02:50.500 --> 02:53.700
I asked my father to describe
 every last one in detail.

02:55.167 --> 02:57.333
Oh, that's heaven!

02:57.367 --> 02:59.133
Was this part of
 the new collection?

02:59.167 --> 03:02.567
-Everything you see here.
-I can't believe
I missed this!

03:02.600 --> 03:06.400
I begged my father.
 If I sneeze,
 he assumes it's pneumonia.

03:06.433 --> 03:09.500
He practically
 locked me in my room.

03:09.533 --> 03:11.600
Madame Sabine,
 I didn't know you were here.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.833
No, I didn't know
 you were here either.

03:13.867 --> 03:16.400
-It's so late.
 -There's still work
 to be done.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.367
Not enough hours in the day.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.067
-Hello.
 -This is Cecile,
 Monsieur Trouvier's daughter.

03:21.067 --> 03:24.300
I ran into her at the
Richelieu where she's
staying with her father.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.400
And I forced Madame Sabine to
 sneak me in. It's my fault.

03:27.433 --> 03:31.067
I'm desperate to wear
something from the new
collection this weekend.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.067
Is there a special occasion?

03:33.067 --> 03:36.567
Monsieur Trouvier is hosting
 a gathering at his chÃ¢teau
 to celebrate our success.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.533
Oh, yes.
 I think I heard about that.

03:38.567 --> 03:41.067
We must find you
 something special.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.333
-Let's see.
-Oh, I love this!

03:45.367 --> 03:48.533
-Oh, yes, that one is lovely.
 -Oh, this is beautiful.

03:48.567 --> 03:51.733
-Would this fit me?
-Is my husband upstairs?

03:51.767 --> 03:55.800
Possibly.
 He doesn't usually leave
 without saying good night.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.500
Cecile, you're in good hands.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.567
(CECILE GASPS)

04:04.667 --> 04:07.700
-It would look fantastic.
-This one I love.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.367
Knock-knock.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.367
How was dinner?

04:18.399 --> 04:20.632
Wet. They just
wanted to drink.

04:22.267 --> 04:25.267
I ran into Jules Trouvier and
 his daughter on the way out.

04:25.300 --> 04:29.100
-I didn't know
 they were still in Paris.
 -Oh, yes. She's downstairs.

04:29.133 --> 04:30.733
They're not leaving
 until Cecile has

04:30.767 --> 04:33.600
at least six costume changes
 for the weekend.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.567
(HE LAUGHS)

04:35.600 --> 04:38.767
-Do you expect to be here
much longer?
-Hope not.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.067
The magazine sent over proofs
 and overheated copy.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.367
There aren't enough
 hours in the day.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.067
Yes, Charlotte
 mentioned that.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.167
-Are they gonna use this?
 -Eliette wants it for
 the last page of the spread.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.367
Any chance
 they could take it again?
 Maybe squeeze Claude into it.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.767
I don't think Eliette's eager
 to squeeze Claude
 into anything except a pulp.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.733
There'll be other pictures.

05:06.767 --> 05:10.400
You keep working.
I'll drop Cecile
and I'll see you at home.

05:10.433 --> 05:13.200
Mm-hm.

05:13.233 --> 05:16.233
What were you
 talking to Claude
 about the other night?

05:17.233 --> 05:19.233
When you were
both at the bar?

05:20.233 --> 05:22.067
What are you asking me?

05:22.900 --> 05:25.733
Why did he want to be there?

05:25.767 --> 05:29.767
Do you have something
to do with his sudden
appetite for visibility?

05:31.533 --> 05:36.200
Your brother trusts me,
Paul, and I'm sorry that
you see that as a threat.

05:37.367 --> 05:42.067
I don't.
 I appreciate your help.

05:42.067 --> 05:46.333
Just wanna make sure
 we all have our eyes
 on the same prize.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.267
(MELLOW JAZZ IN BACKGROUND)

06:18.300 --> 06:21.100
-Are you hungry?
-Always.

06:22.367 --> 06:25.867
Do you think your brother
has a clue about us?

06:25.900 --> 06:29.300
I don't think my brother's
 thinking about me at all.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.800
-What's this?
 -Hospitality.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.233
-I don't serve meals, so...
 -I'm flattered.

06:37.267 --> 06:40.267
You should be. They're still
 black market round here.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.133
They're a gift, actually,
from some baroness.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.467
She's got groves of them
somewhere. Marbella.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.700
Mesopotamia.
 Somewhere with an M.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.200
Why is she sending you gifts?

06:50.233 --> 06:53.167
We sold her a gown that makes
 her look taller than my cat.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.767
-Must be nice.
 -Not really.

06:55.800 --> 07:00.300
The gifts aren't
addressed to me, they're
addressed to my brother.

07:00.333 --> 07:03.067
"Oh, monsieur.
 You must come visit us.

07:03.067 --> 07:05.667
You must come see
 our little castle."

07:05.700 --> 07:09.333
-"Please. Come see our zoo."
 -Does she have one?

07:09.367 --> 07:11.633
-Don't they all?
-You should go.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.100
No, thanks.

07:15.933 --> 07:18.067
I'm racing
at the end of the month.

07:18.067 --> 07:19.933
You should come.

07:19.967 --> 07:21.667
-Fuck you.
 -It'll be fun.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.100
-Oh!
-Private estate.

07:23.133 --> 07:26.633
Filled with lovely ladies
who'll be decked out
in finery from your shop.

07:26.667 --> 07:29.833
You must have me
 mistaken for someone
 who likes people like you.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.500
Come on.
 Be my cheering section.

07:33.067 --> 07:37.067
Don't you wanna see me take
 a hairpin turn on two wheels?

07:37.067 --> 07:39.533
I thought I already had.

07:39.567 --> 07:42.733
Weren't you with
 a lovely lady when we met?

07:43.933 --> 07:47.200
-Your jaw must be tired.
 -Is that another invitation?

07:47.233 --> 07:51.933
I was referring to that nasty
 habit you have. Snapping
 the hand that feeds you.

07:51.967 --> 07:54.767
-I feed myself.
-Such a waste of energy.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.433
All they wanna do is pet you.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.700
You should go.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.333
I have to get up early
 in the morning.

08:07.933 --> 08:10.700
VICTOR: She was here?
 In your office?

08:12.533 --> 08:16.500
-Not by my invitation.
 -Do you want me to ask her?

08:16.533 --> 08:19.100
Dominique may not have left
 that there herself.

08:19.133 --> 08:21.300
She's smarter than that.

08:23.500 --> 08:28.433
Now, this...
was delivered to Rossi...

08:28.467 --> 08:32.232
...the American reporter
who went after the Mayor.

08:38.832 --> 08:43.133
-Who do you think
would write such a thing?
-I don't know.

08:43.167 --> 08:46.267
It could very well be
 the work of someone
 in this building.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.233
Many of the workers
 will be here over the weekend
 catching up on orders.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.767
Don't waste the opportunity.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.433
But I would start with her.

08:56.300 --> 09:01.367
-All of them?
-The daughter
wants to see everything.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.833
But this one isn't even
my size. Who will model?

09:03.867 --> 09:05.533
Flor called in sick.

09:05.567 --> 09:08.967
There's a rumour that she's
 on a Scandinavian holiday...

09:09.067 --> 09:11.700
with the Norwegian prince
who came to see the show.

09:11.733 --> 09:14.800
-A real prince?
-I don't think his title
even matters.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.700
All Flor's looking for is
 a husband who can give her

09:17.733 --> 09:20.933
a sweet house in the country
 and lots of babies.

09:20.967 --> 09:25.733
I'm betting you'll meet
 a few princes yourself
 this weekend.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.967
I'm not going.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.367
Why? Monsieur Trouvier
 invited you himself.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.433
I can't spend
 a whole weekend posing,

09:34.467 --> 09:37.300
strangers asking me
where did I go to school.

09:37.333 --> 09:40.367
-Where are my people from?
 -Who cares?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.333
Make it up as you go along.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.400
Flor just went away with him?
 A man she barely knows.

09:47.433 --> 09:52.600
I'm guessing they'll know
 each other pretty well
 after she sits on his throne.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.333
Ah. So you are in here.

09:57.867 --> 10:00.633
-What do you want?
 -I may have found you
 a place.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.767
-You mentioned
 your living situation.
 -It's better now. Thank you.

10:05.967 --> 10:10.033
I think I'll... model...
this one first.

10:16.967 --> 10:20.967
The film wasn't in the bag
 and I don't know what
 I'm supposed to tell him.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.233
You tell him that some of the
 film was defective and you
 sent the negatives to a lab.

10:25.267 --> 10:28.233
I can't...
I can't keep apologising.

10:28.267 --> 10:31.033
You're not apologising.
 You're buying time.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.900
I'll speak to my friend
at the American Embassy.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.533
We'll find out more
 about this man
 following your buddy.

10:35.567 --> 10:38.567
He's not my buddy. He's just
 a guy from back home.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.067
Just because we laugh at the
 same jokes and miss hot dogs,

10:42.100 --> 10:44.300
doesn't mean I'm writing
fan letters to Stalin.

10:44.333 --> 10:48.133
Billy, whoever took
 your camera bag might
 still have these negatives.

10:48.167 --> 10:51.200
And they can't mean
 much to him.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.733
What if he just
 took my negatives
 and threw 'em in the Seine?

10:54.767 --> 10:56.600
Then he has no taste.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.333
Which is a crime
 much worse than yours.

10:59.367 --> 11:03.867
I just feel like every time
 I turn around here,
 I step into another pile...

11:03.900 --> 11:05.367
You do.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.567
But it's because you've been
 doing a lot of walking.

11:09.567 --> 11:12.300
You don't be ashamed
of your ambition, Billy.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.200
It's what my husband
 likes about you.

11:14.233 --> 11:17.200
You're the only one who has
 as much as he does.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.367
You won't tell him
 I told you this?

11:24.467 --> 11:27.067
Why would I?

11:29.700 --> 11:31.700
Have you eaten
since yesterday?

11:33.133 --> 11:35.300
What was yesterday?

11:37.067 --> 11:38.667
Come on.

11:42.933 --> 11:46.567
-(WOMAN SINGING IN FRENCH)
 -God, I love that colour!

11:51.633 --> 11:53.267
Should I get that one too?

11:53.300 --> 11:56.867
It's only a weekend.
 You can't wear them
 two at a time.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.567
There'll be other weekends,
 Papa.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.267
And weekdays.
 I'd wear that on a Tuesday.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.500
Cecile, be sensible.
Would you really
feel comfortable in that?

12:05.533 --> 12:07.733
Wouldn't you prefer
 something more modest?

12:07.767 --> 12:12.733
You means sleeves?
Just say it. Something
that covers my fat arms.

12:12.767 --> 12:16.233
There's nothing wrong
with your arms. I'm just
saying choose wisely.

12:16.267 --> 12:19.567
Monsieur designs
in many different styles.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.600
Maybe there's something else
 you would like.

12:22.633 --> 12:24.700
This, for example. Hmm?

12:24.733 --> 12:28.667
Actually, monsieur, this can
 be worn with a silk shrug.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.467
Oh, but you don't need it.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.567
The dress would be just as
 flattering on you without it.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.567
-Maybe in a darker colour.
 -But this is a colour
 you love.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.067
On you.

12:39.067 --> 12:41.333
I wasn't sure at first.

12:41.367 --> 12:44.333
It took some time
 to get used to. It's true.

12:44.367 --> 12:48.133
I only own three dresses.
 Light, medium and dark brown.

12:48.167 --> 12:52.600
Papa? May I? Please?

12:57.633 --> 13:01.767
Nina, wait! If I wear that,
 what are you going to wear?

13:01.800 --> 13:05.400
Oh, er, unfortunately
 Nina can't join us
 for the weekend.

13:05.433 --> 13:07.067
What? Why?

13:07.100 --> 13:10.800
I thought you said
 that there would be guests
 that I could talk with.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.233
There are.
The Marquise de LithiÃ¨re.

13:13.267 --> 13:17.800
Papa, the Marquise
 doesn't talk to me.
 She just corrects my grammar.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.333
There's one more dress.
 Excuse me.

13:23.967 --> 13:27.767
You ask me to be a hostess.
 Why can't I dress like one?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.067
Who's that?

13:46.833 --> 13:49.100
Are you looking for Marianne?

13:49.133 --> 13:51.067
She had
 a doctor's appointment.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.467
Who'll be supervising
 over the weekend?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.267
We won't fall behind.
 I'll be here.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.467
Glad to hear that. Who else?

13:58.833 --> 14:02.500
Clarice, Genevieve, Martine.

14:02.533 --> 14:05.633
What about Dominique?
 Does she have any fittings?

14:05.667 --> 14:08.900
She does. Why?

14:08.933 --> 14:12.533
Will you be managing
 the place while Monsieur's
 out of town?

14:16.567 --> 14:20.333
Did you have something
 to do with this German
 fountain pen he found?

14:20.367 --> 14:23.700
What was that detective
 talking about? Was it yours?

14:23.733 --> 14:26.600
You don't need answers.
 Just say thank you.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.067
How can I thank you
when I don't know why
this detective went away?

14:30.067 --> 14:34.633
You can't suddenly treat me
 like a passenger
 on this train.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.733
What?

14:40.967 --> 14:44.300
-What, am I supposed
 to knock first?
 -Trouvier's in the building.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.933
-We could have been
 in a meeting.
 -You could have been.

14:46.967 --> 14:50.067
But you weren't.
Where did that come from?

14:50.067 --> 14:51.833
-Do you like it?
-Does it matter?

14:51.867 --> 14:54.967
-It's borrowed.
-I've put down a deposit.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.467
-What are you eating?
 -Whatever she can.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.167
Take one.
 Use your back teeth,
 they're a little stale.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.233
Erm, is there a reason
that Victor just asked me

15:05.267 --> 15:06.933
if I was working
over the weekend?

15:06.967 --> 15:10.200
I've asked some of the girls
 to put in extra hours.
 We're behind.

15:10.233 --> 15:13.900
You're welcome to be here,
 of course, unless you get
 a better invitation.

15:13.933 --> 15:16.433
Mm. I just did.

15:17.567 --> 15:21.133
From the silent partner's
not so silent daughter.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.767
What did you say?

15:26.100 --> 15:29.400
Well, I said that I would
check my calendar.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.067
But I'm beginning to think
 that I might be available.

15:37.733 --> 15:41.633
It's an intimate gathering of
 potential clients, Claude.

15:41.667 --> 15:45.400
Really?
 Will there be more pictures
 you don't want me to be in?

15:45.433 --> 15:47.600
Claude.

15:47.633 --> 15:50.067
It's not your crowd.
 You'd be bored.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.900
Mm. You see,
 I think it might be useful...

15:52.933 --> 15:55.633
...me to see all your clients
 shed their clothes...

15:55.667 --> 15:57.200
jump into the swimming hole.

15:57.233 --> 15:59.167
Be far easier for me
 to design for them

15:59.200 --> 16:01.700
once I've seen
 all their lumps and bumps.

16:01.733 --> 16:04.300
Oh, Maman. Slow down.

16:05.267 --> 16:08.067
You don't have any
 back teeth. (CHUCKLES)

16:13.167 --> 16:16.667
-He's testing you.
 -Let him. But not in public.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.333
If you shove,
he'll shove back.

16:18.367 --> 16:21.233
I can't have him wandering
 around that chÃ¢teau,

16:21.267 --> 16:23.933
-worrying if he's
gonna detonate.
-Oh, Paul!

16:23.967 --> 16:27.400
He pissed on Eliette Malet
 in front of a room
 full of reporters.

16:27.433 --> 16:30.167
We can't make enemies of the
 people we need as friends.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.867
-If you get him uninvited--
 -I'll speak to Trouvier.

16:33.900 --> 16:37.367
That guest list just expanded
 to include you as well.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.067
Me?

16:39.100 --> 16:42.367
This weekend?
 I'm not sure I'm available.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.233
You'll be there.
 Keeping him on a leash.

16:45.267 --> 16:48.367
If he strays,
you both go home.

16:48.400 --> 16:52.867
-And you're to steer clear
 of Helen. You hear me?
 -Why? Is She contagious?

16:52.900 --> 16:56.567
If you want a seat
 on this train,
 you can pay for the ticket.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.532
You're going now?
 What changed your mind?

17:05.700 --> 17:07.700
Cecile wants me to be there.

17:07.733 --> 17:12.067
Besides, there aren't that
 many princes left in Paris.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.233
(MAN SINGING IN FRENCH)

17:27.166 --> 17:29.500
It seems Cecile did find
something to wear.

17:29.533 --> 17:34.333
Ah, yes.
The atelier has found
its most devoted client.

17:35.533 --> 17:39.133
Unfortunately,
she's not paying retail.

17:39.167 --> 17:42.833
Madame Sabine,
 you were right. They found
 three dresses that fit me.

17:42.867 --> 17:46.067
This young lady's going to
 need a whole new closet.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.733
Yes, I've you
 to blame for this.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.300
Bringing her here when she
 should have been in bed.

17:50.333 --> 17:54.433
Although if her mother was
 still alive, she'd probably
 have done the same thing.

17:54.467 --> 17:57.467
-I'm glad I could
be there for her.
-Cecile.

17:57.500 --> 18:01.433
A little gift. Gloves to go
 with that gorgeous brocade.

18:01.467 --> 18:04.767
Oh, Charlotte,
you read my mind.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.567
-What else am I thinking?
-A hat?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.800
A weekend away for you.

18:08.833 --> 18:12.467
If we're celebrating the
maison, you deserve to be
there too! Doesn't she?

18:12.500 --> 18:14.433
-I couldn't possibly--
 -If you're not,

18:14.467 --> 18:17.367
I'll wear the wrong gloves
 with the wrong brocade.
 Please!

18:17.400 --> 18:20.800
Please say yes.
There are so many things
I want to show you.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.100
-There's a garden
 I designed myself.
 -Oh, really.

19:22.933 --> 19:25.133
Nina. Come on over.

19:25.167 --> 19:28.333
Out host will be eager
 to introduce you.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.967
Wow.

19:30.067 --> 19:32.500
I might turn into
 a mouse at midnight.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.500
It was worth the drive,
 wasn't it?

19:34.533 --> 19:38.100
Impressive set of wheels.
New purchase?

19:38.133 --> 19:39.700
It is, indeed.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.533
Lovely.

19:42.567 --> 19:46.467
I would have thought
 you'd hold off until the...
 next collection.

19:48.767 --> 19:52.300
Let me introduce you
 to General de Fournay
 and his wife.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.133
She's quite smitten
 by your design

19:54.167 --> 19:57.967
and he loves to dress her
to complement his medals.

19:58.067 --> 20:00.233
He was decorated
 after the Ardennes.

20:05.833 --> 20:08.100
Erm, excuse me for a moment.

20:09.900 --> 20:13.433
You're here!
 We're so glad you came.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.367
I wouldn't have missed
seeing you in that dress.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.767
I'm so glad
 you took the shrug.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.567
-It looks lovely on you.
-Thank you.

20:20.600 --> 20:24.267
It really does.
It fits you like a glove.

20:24.300 --> 20:28.333
Come! Come. There's
 so much I want to show you.
 And you must be starving.

20:31.467 --> 20:34.667
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
 Can I just grab
 a quick shot of you?

20:34.700 --> 20:39.200
How was your trip?
 Mine was dreadful.

20:39.233 --> 20:42.000
-OK.
 -What was
 Charlotte thinking?

20:42.033 --> 20:43.733
Hold that. Perfect.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.400
Still, it would have been
 too obvious if she declined.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.967
What do you mean too obvious?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.033
Don't make me spell it out.

20:51.067 --> 20:55.800
It's time you stopped
 seeing me as the pebble
 in your shoe, my dear.

20:55.833 --> 20:58.700
We're both on the same side.

20:58.733 --> 21:03.200
Mesdames, please come inside.
 The champagne
 won't last for ever.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.800
(HORN TOOTS)

21:09.433 --> 21:12.767
Must be the Contessa.
 Always the last to arrive.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.800
Has to make an entrance.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.467
Contessa.
Looking lovely as always.

21:26.167 --> 21:32.333
I would be the first to admit
 that I've made some unwise
 decisions in business.

21:32.367 --> 21:37.400
But joining forces with Paul
 Sabine is not one of them.

21:37.433 --> 21:43.467
With this new collection,
 Paul has announced that
 Paris is far from finished.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.933
He recognises
 that this great nation

21:46.967 --> 21:51.333
is where couture
 and culture began.

21:51.367 --> 21:57.067
I apologise to my American
 friends, but the truth hurts.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.733
(LAUGHTER)

21:58.767 --> 22:04.433
I salute a man
 who understands
 that timing makes the hero,

22:04.467 --> 22:07.433
and this is
 Paul Sabine's time.

22:07.467 --> 22:10.967
His passion for the industry
 has remained steadfast

22:11.067 --> 22:14.067
through the dark years
 of the war.

22:14.067 --> 22:18.467
And he has come through it
 with a shining vision
 of the future.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.633
Our nation's future.

22:25.467 --> 22:28.667
-Vive la France.
 -ALL: Vive la France.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.667
You're so lucky
 to have grown up there!

22:39.700 --> 22:41.400
-What?
 -In Paris.

22:41.433 --> 22:44.500
I had a governess who told me
 about the thrilling carnivals
 in the Tuileries.

22:44.533 --> 22:46.367
Did you ever go to one?

22:46.400 --> 22:47.967
Ah... no.

22:48.067 --> 22:52.733
I... I grew up
 about 40 kilometres
 from the nearest governess.

22:54.733 --> 22:57.633
(GIGGLES)

22:57.667 --> 22:59.233
Oh, you!

22:59.267 --> 23:02.300
-How funny.
 -Take no notice of him.

23:02.333 --> 23:06.067
He's always had this
 very dark sense of humour.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.533
Oh, right. I see.

23:08.567 --> 23:11.267
And anyway,
 you can't fool me.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.300
I know you've seen
 that side of Paris.

23:13.333 --> 23:16.200
(LAUGHS) Thank you.

23:16.233 --> 23:18.633
-It's my pleasure.
 -You're American!

23:18.667 --> 23:22.167
Keep it down. I'd like to
stick around for dessert.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.300
I've wanted to meet you
 for a while, Madame Sabine.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.133
Me? Why?

23:27.167 --> 23:29.267
I came over to do a story
about your husband

23:29.300 --> 23:31.367
a few months back
 but it got derailed.

23:31.400 --> 23:37.333
Now I'm working on something
 about ex-pats who stayed
 in Paris during the war.

23:37.367 --> 23:39.467
Well, you should
 speak to my uncle.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.667
His story is far more
 compelling than mine.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.100
He runs the American
 hospital in Neuilly.

23:44.133 --> 23:45.567
I know. I interviewed him.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.567
He was the one
 who suggested we meet.
 He's a wonderful man.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.767
This room was used
 by the Army in the Great War.

23:51.800 --> 23:55.067
I once found a bullet casing
 in the wine cellar.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.133
-Better than in your wine.
 -(THEY GIGGLE)

23:58.167 --> 24:00.633
Don't you agree? Claude?

24:00.667 --> 24:01.800
Hmm?

24:02.967 --> 24:04.733
Yes. Yes.

24:04.767 --> 24:07.467
Maman, your champagne.
 Let me get you another one.

24:07.500 --> 24:11.067
-Maybe Cecile would like
some more as well.
-Right.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.067
We're still working on
 his party etiquette.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.767
Mm...

24:21.800 --> 24:24.067
Small world, Monsieur Rossi.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.467
What brings you here?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.667
Toasting your success.
 I'm sorry I missed the show.

24:30.700 --> 24:34.233
Oh, that's right -
 I wasn't invited to that one.

24:34.267 --> 24:36.967
I'm sure you weren't invited
 to this one.

24:37.067 --> 24:39.067
What business do you have
with my wife?

24:39.067 --> 24:43.367
-I'm doing a story on--
-This is a private party.

24:43.400 --> 24:49.067
Unless it's a gossip column,
 there's no story you're doing
 that would involve my wife.

24:49.100 --> 24:51.167
Stay away from her.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.200
Hm.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.167
We need a better system,
you and I.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.100
Because you clearly
 can't read lips.

25:08.067 --> 25:10.533
I was drowning in there.

25:10.567 --> 25:12.600
You can save yourself.

25:14.067 --> 25:16.367
(SIGHS) What's going on?

25:18.567 --> 25:21.200
Seriously, one day
 you ask for my help...

25:21.233 --> 25:24.700
and the next
I'm an open sore.

25:26.767 --> 25:29.233
(EXHALES) Is it because
 I couldn't offer you
 a place to live?

25:29.267 --> 25:33.767
-Because you know
 your mother would've--
 -It's not about my mother.

25:48.333 --> 25:53.067
Is this about the man you saw
 outside my flat that day,
 holding a bottle of wine?

25:54.500 --> 25:58.067
-Cos he's a friend.
 -I don't want to know.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.667
It's none of my business.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.933
-You can be friends with
whomever you want.
-Right.

26:03.967 --> 26:07.333
But you shouldn't lie.
 Or hurt people.

26:07.367 --> 26:10.700
Or play games
 with their feelings.

26:10.733 --> 26:14.267
-I've never played games--
 -Yes. You did.

26:14.300 --> 26:18.600
And you're doing it again
right now with Cecile.

26:18.633 --> 26:21.400
Or do you plan on making a
 fool of every girl you meet?

26:25.800 --> 26:28.200
Oh, I...

26:28.233 --> 26:32.700
Monsieur Trouvier
 wants to give us
 a tour of the gardens.

26:32.733 --> 26:34.300
I thought you might wanna...

26:36.267 --> 26:38.167
Yes.

26:39.067 --> 26:41.167
Yes, I would.

27:01.567 --> 27:03.567
(MAN CROONING ON RADIO)

27:15.067 --> 27:17.200
Thank you.

27:21.233 --> 27:23.967
You should let me fix that.

27:24.067 --> 27:26.433
-Fix what?
-The loose button
on your cuff.

27:26.467 --> 27:28.467
-May I?
 -Sure.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.733
I don't believe I've seen you
 in this? Is it new?

27:35.767 --> 27:39.067
Old. It only gets worn
 for weddings and funerals.

27:39.067 --> 27:41.433
Oh. Has somebody died?

27:41.467 --> 27:45.067
No. I'm having a drink
 with Dominique tonight.

27:45.067 --> 27:49.067
I suggested a corner cafÃ©
 but she insists on Le Cinq.

28:00.067 --> 28:02.133
Thank you.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.433
(BIRDSONG)

28:08.900 --> 28:11.400
ROSSI: He makes you
 work weekends.

28:11.433 --> 28:15.133
That's either pure devotion
 or blind ambition.

28:15.167 --> 28:17.467
In your case, it's probably
 more blind than pure.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.233
How'd you get yourself
 invited to this?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.567
You're like a bad penny,
you know?

28:24.400 --> 28:26.500
-Who are you working for now?
 -I'm doing a story--

28:26.533 --> 28:30.133
-I know the story.
Who wants it this badly?
-French paper.

28:30.167 --> 28:35.333
They don't make me
 work on weekends. I go to
 parties in fancy chÃ¢teaus.

28:35.367 --> 28:38.200
I can get you a place
 over there. Last call, Billy.

28:38.233 --> 28:41.200
-Get out while you can.
 -Just leave.

28:41.233 --> 28:42.867
Don't say I didn't warn you.

28:42.900 --> 28:45.833
When the shit hits the fan,
 there isn't a laundry
 in Paris

28:45.867 --> 28:47.500
that'll get that stink
 off you.

28:47.533 --> 28:50.300
-What is it you think
 you got on him?
 -Proof.

28:51.733 --> 28:56.067
Your boss made
 more than a few trips
 to Berlin and Vienna.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.600
While his boss was spinning
 a story about keeping
 the industry in France.

28:59.633 --> 29:03.133
I wonder what our host
 would think if he knew
 he was toasting a hero

29:03.167 --> 29:05.633
-who'd been on two payrolls.
 -Then write it.

29:05.667 --> 29:09.400
If you're so sure that you
 got the dirt on him,
 then publish the story

29:09.433 --> 29:12.633
and leave him the fuck alone.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.767
Jesus, what did you think was
 gonna happen this weekend?

29:14.800 --> 29:17.800
You were gonna
 smoke him out, he was
 gonna confess over Cognac?

29:19.367 --> 29:22.400
You're bluffing. You haven't
 got anything real on him.

29:22.433 --> 29:26.167
You take your shot
when the light is right,
Billy. You know that.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.233
Yeah, I do.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.633
Ooh, that is some dress.

29:33.167 --> 29:35.700
Now I know why you work
 weekends, kid.

29:35.733 --> 29:39.333
Turns out you're not blind.
 Or pure.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.400
Mademoiselle.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.200
Monsieur.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.633
What did he mean by that?

29:53.667 --> 29:55.600
Oh, nothing.

29:55.633 --> 29:58.067
Just stand a little closer
 to the hedge, please.

29:58.833 --> 30:01.667
Billy, who was
he talking about?

30:01.700 --> 30:05.500
Just turn to face me.
 The light is flattening
 everything here.

30:07.100 --> 30:11.267
-So should I just--
 -I just want you
 to stand still!

30:11.300 --> 30:14.367
Jesus Christ, you were
 supposed to be
 out here an hour ago.

30:16.100 --> 30:17.500
Was he talking
 about Monsieur?

30:17.533 --> 30:21.633
Yes. Yes.
 He was accusing him...

30:21.667 --> 30:25.067
...of doing some pretty
 nasty things during the war.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.800
-Like what?
 -It doesn't matter.

30:26.833 --> 30:28.300
Yes, it does.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.200
Do you believe him?

30:31.233 --> 30:35.067
I don't know what
 I believe... any more.

30:37.667 --> 30:39.800
Take the picture.

30:55.433 --> 30:57.733
If only they could speak...

31:00.733 --> 31:02.800
...what stories
they might tell.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.533
What a neck.

31:06.567 --> 31:09.600
Imagine finding
the right dress for her.

31:14.333 --> 31:17.500
This one reminds me
of someone we both know.

31:17.533 --> 31:21.433
Did I mention I saw Madame
 Fortier at the theatre?

31:23.400 --> 31:27.100
I didn't realise you two
had such a long history.

31:27.133 --> 31:30.500
-I've only just met her.
-Oh, please, Charlotte.

31:30.533 --> 31:34.300
That kind of lie only
 works if you're dead
 and hanging on a wall.

31:35.867 --> 31:39.067
We both know how you know her
 and why you didn't use her

31:39.100 --> 31:42.400
as a reference when you
 applied for this job.

31:42.433 --> 31:45.167
You've been remarkably
 discreet, my dear.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.833
But how long can you keep
that up before Paul

31:47.867 --> 31:51.333
or, God forbid, Monsieur
 Trouvier learns the truth?

31:51.367 --> 31:53.200
How will
Generale de Fournay feel

31:53.233 --> 31:55.933
about you telling his wife
 what clothes to put on

31:55.967 --> 32:00.433
when you have spent so many
 years taking yours off?

32:12.800 --> 32:14.233
-What is that?
 -Nothing.

32:14.267 --> 32:17.333
Charlotte forgot to bring
 a gift intended for Cecile.

32:17.367 --> 32:19.800
We'll send it
when we get home.

32:19.833 --> 32:21.800
How many gifts
does Cecile need?

32:22.800 --> 32:24.800
Charlotte gave her one
 in Paris.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.133
I'm not sitting through
 a dinner

32:33.167 --> 32:36.467
with me on one side of you
 and your mistress
 on the other.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.067
Helen...

32:49.533 --> 32:53.467
-I didn't invite her.
 -It doesn't matter
 who invited her.

32:53.500 --> 32:58.667
The fact is she's here
 and I am not crazy
 or delusional.

32:58.700 --> 33:02.267
-I should have said
 something weeks ago.
 -(KNOCKING)

33:08.133 --> 33:10.100
Go ahead, answer it.

33:17.400 --> 33:21.400
-Nina.
-Monsieur.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.733
What's wrong?

33:24.533 --> 33:27.400
Oh, pardon, monsieur.
 It can wait.

33:34.800 --> 33:38.133
-Does she know too?
 -She knows nothing.

33:38.167 --> 33:42.400
Your brother might be willing
 to live with an arrangement,
 but I am not.

33:43.733 --> 33:45.500
You tell her to leave.

33:45.533 --> 33:48.267
-I'll deal with this
 Monday morning.
 -No, you won't.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.067
She won't be there Monday
morning. I want her gone.

33:53.067 --> 33:54.467
Gone.

34:09.266 --> 34:11.100
A bit quiet here tonight.

34:11.132 --> 34:15.233
Maybe everyone in Paris
 was invited to Chez Trouvier
 except for us.

34:15.266 --> 34:18.467
Ah. No interest.
I'm a city rat.

34:19.833 --> 34:22.067

34:24.867 --> 34:28.100
Become very popular
 with Americans, this place.

34:28.132 --> 34:31.100
I have heard Billy raving
about the poulet frites.

34:31.132 --> 34:34.100
Billy is easily impressed.

34:36.167 --> 34:38.167
Have you spent
 much time with him?

34:38.199 --> 34:42.199
I took him to a few clubs
when he first got here.

34:42.233 --> 34:44.400
Whatever happened to that
 reporter he came over with?

34:44.433 --> 34:47.667
Did you show him
 some clubs as well?

34:47.699 --> 34:51.233
You think I'm keen on
 entertaining every American
 who crosses my path?

34:51.266 --> 34:56.266
-I wasn't implying--
 -I don't need to make friends
 with reporters, Victor.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.900
It's not a career move
 that interests me.

34:58.933 --> 35:00.833
What is?

35:00.867 --> 35:05.267
I haven't decided yet, but...
 given that Monsieur Sabine's

35:05.300 --> 35:08.867
taste in models has shifted,
 maybe it's time I did.

35:08.900 --> 35:11.367
Monsieur values you.
 Very much.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.133
So do a few other
 designers in this town.

35:14.167 --> 35:18.167
-They give me lovely gifts.
 -What kind of gifts?

35:32.233 --> 35:33.800
(HANDBRAKE CLICKS)

(CAR DOOR SHUTS)

35:51.200 --> 35:53.533
Always wanted to know
 where he hides it.

35:53.567 --> 35:55.433
Where's the garage?

35:55.467 --> 35:57.067
Who cares?

35:57.100 --> 36:01.367
Bugatti only produced
 four Atlantic 39s.
 Trouvier owns one of them.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.633
Trouvier owns
 one of everything.

36:05.267 --> 36:09.567
Where are you going?
 This isn't exactly
 a quick getaway.

-(DOOR CLUNKS)
 -What did I tell you?
 She's a killer.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.567
I didn't expect anyone
 to still be here.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.900
-I was on my way out.
 -No, you weren't.

37:10.933 --> 37:14.567
You were exactly
 where you wanted to be.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.133
I live there too.

37:17.933 --> 37:20.100
It's lovely.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.500
Maybe we should make
a suggestion to Monsieur.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

37:32.733 --> 37:35.733
-Hello.
 -Maman. Maman, it's me.

37:35.767 --> 37:37.867
Nina. What's wrong?

37:37.900 --> 37:41.733
Remember that American
 reporter who came with Billy
 to the atelier?

37:41.767 --> 37:46.500
He's here and...
 he's questioning what
 Monsieur did during the war.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.667
-What did you say? 
 -I just...

37:49.700 --> 37:51.700
I have to go.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.267
Nina.

37:57.300 --> 38:00.600
I hope you don't mind.
I was calling my mother.

38:00.633 --> 38:04.433
No. Of course not.
Is everything all right?

38:07.333 --> 38:09.600
Please don't say
 you regret joining us.

38:10.433 --> 38:12.767
You're like
 a breath of fresh air.

38:12.800 --> 38:17.433
Cecile is usually surrounded
 by people who are...
 anything but sincere.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.500
Duplicitous, in fact.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.500
I know how that feels.

38:29.167 --> 38:31.367
There's someone here...

38:31.400 --> 38:34.767
who's made it
 very uncomfortable for me.

38:36.967 --> 38:39.200
Do you mind telling me
 who that is?

38:41.967 --> 38:44.267
An American reporter.

38:46.067 --> 38:49.933
He... implied
 that I was only here

38:49.967 --> 38:54.467
because Monsieur and I
 had more than
 a professional relationship.

38:57.433 --> 39:00.700
That couldn't be
 farther from the truth.

39:00.733 --> 39:03.467
Shame on him. Hm?

39:03.500 --> 39:06.267
I will have a private word
 with the Contessa.

39:07.933 --> 39:10.067
They will be gone
by breakfast.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.233
Thank you.

39:23.067 --> 39:26.533
Hey. How long does it take
 to pet a car?

39:26.567 --> 39:28.567
I've only just got
 my hands on her.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.267
What else have you
 been doing?

39:30.300 --> 39:32.133

39:32.167 --> 39:33.733
He followed me in here.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.500
Why?

39:36.533 --> 39:39.467
The seats
 are hardly broken in.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.200
Why did my brother
 follow you in here?

39:46.233 --> 39:50.767
Who cares? It's just
 a business proposition.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.667
Oh.

39:52.700 --> 39:54.700
(CHATTER)

40:13.667 --> 40:16.800
Probably keeps them in
 the boot room. Have a look.

40:16.833 --> 40:18.867
No. I'm not swiping his keys.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.867
We'll take her
for a short spin.

40:20.900 --> 40:24.333
It's 20 minutes
 to the front gate.
 I just wanna get out of here.

 You just got here.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.467
Let's go!

40:31.300 --> 40:32.933
You were invited,
weren't you?

40:32.967 --> 40:35.167
Wasn't like
 you just showed up?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.467
Did you? Just show up?

40:38.767 --> 40:42.067

 -She'll forgive you.

 She doesn't understand.

-I can't be two people.
 -Oh, relax your crack.

41:25.633 --> 41:28.867
Next summer. In Provence.

41:28.900 --> 41:32.667
She's a vapid
 little aristocrat my
 father set me up with.

41:32.700 --> 41:34.900
She's nice enough.
 She's a bit toothy.

41:34.933 --> 41:36.800
But she's good in the saddle.

41:36.833 --> 41:39.200
You should come.

really mean it.

 is wrong with you?

41:48.933 --> 41:51.600
This is vintage Armagnac,
you wasteful shit!

 a lunatic, do you know that?

 in your fucking hole
 and never come out.

 be a fucking fraud like you.

-Because I won't.

 to disappear.

 a step back and...

 to do with your wife.

 didn't she?

-Didn't she?
-My mother never
said one word.

43:23.133 --> 43:28.067
I'm betting she couldn't wait
 to tell you what I did
 for a living during the war.

43:28.100 --> 43:31.167
-But what she
 didn't tell you is why.
 -She didn't tell me anything.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.867
-But it doesn't matter.
 I don't judge anyone...
 -Like hell it doesn't!

43:33.900 --> 43:36.467
...on what they did to get by
 and I don't judge you.

43:36.500 --> 43:40.167
-No. You just want to
 dispose of me.
 -What do you want?

43:40.200 --> 43:42.333
For you to make
 a different choice!

43:44.400 --> 43:47.733

who you need now.

 but I keep them coming back.

you're not feeling well.

 will you give
 for your better half?

44:57.167 --> 44:59.900
Somebody just rang
 the dinner bell.

45:00.067 --> 45:02.100
I'm coming.

45:05.567 --> 45:08.133
Look, Nina, I'm sorry
 if I snapped at you--

45:08.167 --> 45:11.067
It's not me
 you owe an apology.

45:12.700 --> 45:14.200
What?

45:15.633 --> 45:18.333
It's so easy for you
 to come here now,

45:18.367 --> 45:20.533
sip champagne
 in a place like this.

45:20.567 --> 45:22.433
Roller-skate
 on the Place de la Concorde.

45:22.467 --> 45:26.367
-OK. This is about
 Monsieur Sabine.
 -Have you ever missed a meal?

45:27.933 --> 45:30.800
Gone to bed not knowing
 if the person you said
 good night to

45:30.833 --> 45:32.733
may not be there
in the morning?

45:33.767 --> 45:35.200
Have you?

45:37.233 --> 45:39.167
-That's not fair.
-Fair?

45:40.567 --> 45:42.833
What's fair?

45:42.867 --> 45:44.700
Nothing's fair.

45:48.067 --> 45:52.833
If it weren't for Monsieur
 Sabine, my mother and I
 wouldn't even be here.

45:52.867 --> 45:57.500
The papers he bought for us
 kept us from going to a place
 where nobody came back.

45:58.833 --> 46:00.767
That's his crime, Billy.

46:05.733 --> 46:09.333
You'd be surprised how many
 laws you have to break
 just to survive.

46:11.433 --> 46:14.067
Nina, I...

46:14.067 --> 46:18.500
-I had no idea you and your
 mother were Jewish--
 -Then it worked.

46:22.333 --> 46:25.300
You wear the mask long
 enough, it becomes your face.

46:31.233 --> 46:33.433
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

46:34.600 --> 46:37.900
I'm not disappointed.

46:37.933 --> 46:41.467
I wanna know more.
 I want you to trust me enough
 to tell me everything.

46:41.500 --> 46:44.200
You can't capture it all
in a picture, Billy.

46:51.667 --> 46:54.133
Will you walk with me
 to dinner, please?

46:58.067 --> 47:00.167
Of course.

47:02.600 --> 47:05.467
I don't know much
 about the Marquise,

47:05.500 --> 47:09.900
but she must
 have captivated
 someone's attention

47:09.933 --> 47:13.633
because there are
 30 portraits of her
 in the house.

47:14.700 --> 47:17.867
He's been asking about you.

47:17.900 --> 47:22.700
-You not feeling well, dear?
 -I'm fine. Charlotte is not.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.567
She won't be joining us
 for dinner.

47:31.433 --> 47:33.233
You're welcome.

47:34.933 --> 47:36.700
Madame Sabine.

47:36.733 --> 47:38.733
Oh, sorry. I meant this one.

47:38.767 --> 47:40.367
-Oh.
-(LAUGHS)

47:41.367 --> 47:43.233
I just learned
that Claude left.

47:43.267 --> 47:46.767
-Is he not feeling well?
 -I'm not entirely surprised.

47:46.800 --> 47:52.267
Some bachelors just prefer
 their own company.

47:52.300 --> 47:54.067
Are you sure
 he's already left?

47:54.067 --> 47:55.933
Perhaps he could give
 Charlotte a lift.

47:55.967 --> 47:58.433
Why? Is she ill too?

47:58.467 --> 48:00.633
Oh, was it something
 we served?

48:00.667 --> 48:05.500
No, my dear.
 Any germs that struck were
 carried here from the city.

48:06.833 --> 48:13.100
Well, I hope Charlotte had
 some fun... short as it was.

48:13.133 --> 48:15.967
I'm really glad
 you asked me to invite her.

48:16.067 --> 48:18.167
Me too.

48:20.100 --> 48:22.267
(TRAIN CLATTERING
OVER TRACKS)

48:47.633 --> 48:49.633
(LAUGHTER AND CHATTER)

48:55.200 --> 48:57.367
Would you like one of these?

49:02.733 --> 49:04.800
I'm sorry, Helen.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.767
I knew when I met you...

49:14.700 --> 49:18.400
...you spent your days
 surrounded by
 beautiful women...

49:18.433 --> 49:20.767
who desperately wanted
 your approval.

49:22.600 --> 49:25.200
But you promised me
 something different.

49:27.433 --> 49:29.233
And I didn't leave
 one lousy marriage

49:29.267 --> 49:32.067
to spend
 the next 40 years smiling.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.533
And posing.

49:35.567 --> 49:40.067
And keeping just enough gin
 in the cabinet
 to get to sleep.

49:45.667 --> 49:47.667
I can't do that again.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.200
No more lies.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.767
(CHATTER IN BACKGROUND)

50:07.233 --> 50:11.367
It's not... It's not that
simple, though, is it?

50:13.233 --> 50:15.567
It could all go away
 in a moment.

50:22.567 --> 50:25.067
What could all go away?

50:33.600 --> 50:38.733
There are people here
 who would take
 great pleasure in ruining me.

50:41.500 --> 50:44.700
That reporter who sidled up
 to you before dinner...

50:49.067 --> 50:50.633
...his subject is me.

50:53.333 --> 50:55.667
What I did for the mayor
during the war.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.167
That's what he's looking for.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.367
Well, then, let him look.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.633
He's not gonna find anything.

51:12.900 --> 51:14.600
Is he?

51:19.733 --> 51:21.500
No.

51:33.067 --> 51:36.167
Our host is probably
 wondering where we are.

51:39.900 --> 51:42.633
I'm going to go fix my face.

51:50.233 --> 51:52.400
I'll meet you
 in the dining room.

52:21.700 --> 52:23.767
Why would you want
 to leave Paris?

52:25.767 --> 52:27.333
What?

52:27.367 --> 52:30.200
To go and work
 in a perfume factory.

52:30.233 --> 52:33.167
Who told you that?

52:33.200 --> 52:38.367
Cesar Cassatt. My brother
 asked him to find you
 a position in their company.

52:40.267 --> 52:42.433
Don't work for him.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.367
He's a snake.

52:52.067 --> 52:53.500
As long as we're
being honest,

52:53.533 --> 52:56.167
you're not the only one
 looking across the street.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.400
Then what keeps you
 at the maison?

52:59.733 --> 53:01.500
Habit.

53:02.933 --> 53:04.633
Let's drop the game, Victor.

53:04.667 --> 53:06.667
I'm starting to see
 two of you.

53:06.700 --> 53:10.467
-You and your conniving boss.
 -What do you mean?

53:10.500 --> 53:13.333
It means he sent you here to
 find out what's in this bag.

53:13.367 --> 53:17.067
Should I go to the ladies
 room so you can have a peek?

53:17.067 --> 53:19.933
I'll save you the trouble.

53:19.967 --> 53:22.667
Is this what
he's looking for?

53:22.700 --> 53:25.933
If he's looking for
Billy's pretty pictures,
he can have them back.

53:25.967 --> 53:27.567
But not me.

53:27.600 --> 53:30.767
He'll have to work
a little harder for that.

53:35.667 --> 53:37.167
Dominique.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.900
Dominique! Wait!

53:40.933 --> 53:42.733
Stay away from me,
 you lap-dog!

53:42.767 --> 53:45.700
-What are these?
-(HORN BLARES)

53:49.067 --> 53:50.433
(CHATTER)

53:58.567 --> 54:00.500
Help.

54:00.533 --> 54:03.067
Call the doctor.
Call the doctor!

54:03.900 --> 54:05.867
All right. I got it.

54:05.900 --> 54:09.233
OK. I gotta go.

54:09.267 --> 54:13.733
Madame Sabine. I was hoping
 we would have had a chance
 to chat over dinner,

54:13.767 --> 54:16.767
but unfortunately
we were seated
in different time zones.

54:16.800 --> 54:18.833
Yes, that was a shame,
 wasn't it?

54:18.867 --> 54:23.967
Yep. And now the Contessa
tells me we're apparently
leaving before breakfast.

54:24.067 --> 54:26.133
How about we get together
in Paris?

54:26.167 --> 54:28.900
I'm gonna be there
for another week or two.

54:28.933 --> 54:31.900
I'm afraid not.
 It's a very busy month.

54:31.933 --> 54:33.467
-Ain't that a shame.
 -Mm.

54:33.500 --> 54:38.133
All right. Well, here, just
 in case something opens up.

54:38.167 --> 54:40.567
We already have your card,
 Monsieur Rossi.

54:44.600 --> 54:50.100
-Would you excuse us,
 my dear? Thank you.
 -Madame.

54:53.700 --> 54:56.133
Apparently I didn't make
myself clear earlier.

54:56.167 --> 54:59.700
-I was only extending
 a friendly invitation.
 -You're not a friend.

54:59.733 --> 55:02.433
-And your approach
 is misguided.
 -Is that so?

55:02.467 --> 55:06.367
History only holds up
 one side of our lives,
 Monsieur Rossi.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.633
The other side
 is held up by fiction.

55:09.667 --> 55:12.233
You only seem to want
 to contribute to the latter.

55:12.267 --> 55:15.733
-On the contrary--
 -If you have a question
 about my history,

55:15.767 --> 55:20.300
then you ask me.
 Stop stalking third parties.

55:23.533 --> 55:27.733
If I thought I'd get an
 honest answer, I would.

55:27.767 --> 55:32.133
But I think you've
bought into your own lie,
Monsieur Sabine,

55:32.167 --> 55:34.333
and that's what's
so chilling.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.533
You're a genuine fake.

55:44.367 --> 55:46.367
Aren't we all?

55:58.067 --> 56:00.167
