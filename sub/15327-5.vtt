WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.086
- Hey, boys, how'd you
like to help me

00:03.169 --> 00:04.879
with these wedding favors?

00:04.963 --> 00:06.381
- We're walking.
- I'll pay you.

00:06.464 --> 00:07.757
- We're listening.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.260
- All right, I need 500 for
my client's wedding reception.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.886
Each box needs
two chocolates--

00:11.970 --> 00:14.055
one with a "W"
and one with a "K".

00:14.139 --> 00:16.265
- Five hundred boxes?
Five hundred dollars.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.934
{\an5}- Twenty.
- Fifty.
- Twenty.

00:18.017 --> 00:21.604
- Fine, but you're giving
me self-esteem issues.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.857
- Wait 'til you
start dating.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.066
Here.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.737
All right, two chocolates,
one box, no eating.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.280
- What about
the damaged ones?

00:30.363 --> 00:31.948
- Which ones are damaged?

00:32.031 --> 00:34.617
- This one with
the bite in it?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.703
- Aaron, I'm not paying
you guys to eat.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.456
- Don't worry, Steph,
this one's on the house.

00:39.539 --> 00:43.042
- Hey, lay off my chocolate
or nobody gets paid.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.962
- [smacks hand]
- Dude!

00:46.045 --> 00:47.422
- We can buy all
the chocolate we want

00:47.505 --> 00:49.174
when she gives us
our fifty.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.967
- Twenty.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.887
- Hey, Stephanie,
you look nice today.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.305
- Oh, thank you.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.890
- I started using
this great eye cream--

00:56.973 --> 00:58.475
- Right, you're still
new at this.

00:58.558 --> 01:03.271
"You look nice today" means can
I have some money for the mall?

01:03.354 --> 01:07.400
- Uh, well, you could help
the boys and earn some money.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.320
- Yeah, I'm not
doing all that.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.406
Hey, Dad, you look
nice today.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.659
- Bring me back a Mongolian
chicken ball.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.621
- Hey!
- Will do. Love you. Bye.

01:19.704 --> 01:20.914
- Let me get this straight.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.832
Gabby gets money for
saying you look nice,

01:22.916 --> 01:24.667
but we have to
work for it?

01:24.751 --> 01:25.960
That's gotta be worth
two chocolates.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.004
- Hey, stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it!

01:28.087 --> 01:30.173
- Oh!
- Aaron, what's wrong?

01:30.256 --> 01:32.342
- This chocolate
hurt my tooth.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.260
- If it hurts,
stop eating it.

01:34.344 --> 01:39.182
- I can't help it. It tastes
better than it hurts.

frozen peas for dinner.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.342
{\an8}Here, use this popsicle.

02:14.425 --> 02:17.220
{\an8}- Thanks.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.721
{\an8}Ow!

02:18.805 --> 02:20.723
{\an8}- Aaron, sweetie, it's for
the outside of your mouth.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.893
{\an8}- But it's lemon.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.103
{\an8}Mmm...

02:25.186 --> 02:26.980
{\an8}Ow!

02:27.063 --> 02:28.523
{\an8}Mmmm...Ow!

02:28.606 --> 02:30.900
{\an8}- Give me that.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.778
{\an5}- Hey, I finished
all 500 wedding favors.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.114
{\an8}- You couldn't have filled
all the boxes.

02:36.197 --> 02:36.948
{\an8}You ate at least
30 chocolates.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.450
{\an8}- Let's just say
a few lucky guests

02:39.534 --> 02:40.910
{\an8}are going to enjoy
some Raisin Bran

02:40.994 --> 02:44.581
{\an8}and a gummy vitamin.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.584
{\an5}- I can't give any of that
as a wedding favor.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.751
- Well, then you're
in a pickle.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.046
{\an8}Speaking of which,
one of them has a pickle.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.007
{\an8}- James, get everything
that's not chocolate

02:54.090 --> 02:55.258
{\an8}out of those boxes.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.426
{\an8}- How about fifty bucks?

02:56.509 --> 02:57.760
{\an8}- How about you get to
live in this house?

02:57.844 --> 03:01.264
{\an8}- How about twenty?
- How about you get to live?

03:01.347 --> 03:02.891
{\an8}- I'm pretty sure
you're bluffing,

03:02.974 --> 03:05.602
{\an8}but I'm kinda hungry
and I want that pickle.

03:05.685 --> 03:09.814
{\an5}- Okay, thanks for trying to
squeeze my son in, Dr. Porter.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.149
Oh, sure, I can hold.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.859
- I hate the dentist.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.153
- Aw, sweetie, the dentist
is your friend.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.989
{\an8}- Then I'm thinking
I'm more of a loner.

03:18.072 --> 03:22.619
I'll be upstairs growing
a beard and building a cabin.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.288
- I don't understand why people
are afraid of the dentist.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.789
- It might have
something to do with

03:26.873 --> 03:28.207
all that drilling
and yanking.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.126
- Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.462
I've been cavity-free
my whole life.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.173
I am a dental rock star.
- [laughing]

03:35.256 --> 03:38.343
Oh, you can?
Oh, that's perfect.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.970
I owe you one,
Dr. Porter. Yeah.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.138
I always feel silly

03:42.221 --> 03:42.972
playing the professional
courtesy card with a dentist--

03:43.056 --> 03:45.642
like he's a real doctor.
[laughing]

03:45.725 --> 03:48.102
- Uh, honey, you should
probably hang up.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.771
- Oh, no!

03:52.273 --> 03:54.984
- See?
This isn't so bad.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.319
This is the captain
speaking.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.112
Take us to warp speed.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.156
Oh!
[laughing]

04:01.908 --> 04:04.827
- You go warp speed.
I'll be in the car.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.703
- Oh, come on, Aaron.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.373
I thought you were
braver than this.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.958
- Based on what?

04:10.041 --> 04:12.502
Keys?

04:12.585 --> 04:14.170
- Hey, Aaron,
nice to meet you.

04:14.253 --> 04:17.005
- I heard there were toys.
I'd like mine to go.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.841
- What do you say, Mom?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.677
Why don't we show Aaron
how easy it's gonna be.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.845
- Oh, well, I may not
remember how this goes.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.014
I haven't done it
in a while.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.224
Perfect teeth.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.393
- Well, it's just like
riding a bike,

04:28.476 --> 04:30.812
which you should only
do with a mouth guard.

04:30.895 --> 04:31.562
I have stories.

04:31.646 --> 04:35.400
- Great.
Now I'm afraid of bikes.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.277
- See, Aaron, we just
do a little look see.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.530
A little water.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.865
And a little suction.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.076
And we are done.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.036
- Yes, we are.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.538
No big deal.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.831
- Piece of cake.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.749
Actually, cake is the leading
cause of tooth decay in--

04:51.833 --> 04:56.713
- No! Do not ruin
cake for me.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.214
- All right, Aaron,
it's your turn.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.134
And don't worry. I'll be with
you every step of the way.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.760
- Okay, Aaron.
- It's in the back.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.179
On the bottom left.
- Okay, open wide.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.519
A little wider.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.104
- Good job, Aaron.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.897
See? It's simple.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.190
Aren't you having
a good time?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.609
- [garbled]
I'd rather have cake.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.240
- Okay, I see it.
There is a cavity.

05:24.323 --> 05:25.908
And it's on
his baby tooth.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.035
And since it hurts,

05:27.118 --> 05:29.787
you will need to bring him
back in to get it filled.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.955
- No problem.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.248
- Great, and while
we're at it,

05:32.331 --> 05:35.084
we can take care of
that cavity in your bicuspid.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.503
- That what
in my what-what?

05:41.966 --> 05:43.760
- Hey, honey.
How'd it go with Dr. Porter?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.596
- We do not say that name
in this house.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.557
That man is dead to me.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.101
- What happened?
- I've got a cavity.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.936
- Ah, it's tiny.
They're gonna fill it.

05:54.020 --> 05:58.107
- Not unless
it's with chocolate.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.401
- Don't worry,
he'll be fine.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.944
- So why are you so upset?

06:02.028 --> 06:04.781
- Uh, that quack claimed
I've got a cavity.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.949
You know what?
I want a second opinion.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.620
Here, take a look
for yourself.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.288
- Where did you
get a dental mirror?

06:12.371 --> 06:15.583
- Aaron got a toy.
I figured I deserved something.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.960
- Uh-oh, does this mean
the dental rock star

06:18.044 --> 06:20.296
is gonna have to cancel
her perfect teeth tour?

06:20.379 --> 06:24.675
- Yes, which makes me
available to sing backup

06:24.759 --> 06:29.138
on your bald head tour.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.516
- Okay, that's hurtful.

06:31.599 --> 06:35.019
- And so is this tooth
since that quack poked at it.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.021
- You mean it never
bothered you before?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.314
- Well, it may have been
a little sensitive

06:38.397 --> 06:38.981
when I drank something
really hot.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.692
- Hm.
- Or really cold.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.778
Or really wet.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.905
- Hey, Steph, I fixed all
your chocolate wedding favors

06:45.988 --> 06:47.281
and put 'em in
your trunk.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.325
- James, it's like
80 degrees out.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.661
- Don't worry,
they've only been there

06:51.744 --> 06:53.663
for a couple of hours--
maybe five.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.832
- I was driving around
with them all day?

06:55.915 --> 06:59.168
Great, now I've got
$600 worth of chocolate soup.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.004
- I'll help unload
your trunk.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.423
Unrelated--do we have any graham
crackers and marshmallows?

07:07.718 --> 07:10.680
- Hey, Dad, you look
nice today.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.098
- Sorry, the bank of Dad
is rejecting

07:12.181 --> 07:15.977
your withdrawal request.
- That can't be right.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.521
Maybe I just need
a new pin code.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.315
I love my Daddy.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.233
- If you want money, you're
gonna have to work for it.

07:22.316 --> 07:25.695
- That was not our
unspoken agreement.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.863
Since when?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.531
- Since I pointed out
to your father

07:28.614 --> 07:29.949
that he's being played.

07:30.032 --> 07:33.161
But the good new is I might have
a little job for you.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.037
- Job? Like work?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.998
- Like call the chocolate
shop and order

07:37.081 --> 07:38.541
a thousand monogrammed
chocolates--

07:38.624 --> 07:40.418
half with a "W"
and half with a "K".

07:40.501 --> 07:42.086
Then box them, wrap them, and
keep them away from the boys.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.423
- You lost me
at "little job."

07:45.506 --> 07:47.091
You sure you don't
wanna give me that money

07:47.175 --> 07:50.052
because you are
working that sweater vest.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.722
- And you are
working my last nerve.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.521
- Grandma Maggie,
you look nice today.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.190
- And you look...

08:02.273 --> 08:03.065
broke!

08:03.149 --> 08:05.568
- [scoffs]
How'd you know?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.111
- I was a teenaged girl.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.779
I raised a teenaged girl.

08:08.863 --> 08:14.202
There isn't a teenaged girl's
flim-flam I don't know about.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.245
- This is not a flim-flam.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.207
I'm just short a little
money for...books.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.708
- Library's free.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.543
- I meant money
for a field trip.

08:22.627 --> 08:26.297
- You go to a public school.
They don't go anywhere.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.966
Next!

08:29.050 --> 08:32.428
- I'm sponsoring a hungry child
from a Third World country.

08:32.510 --> 08:37.308
- Which one?
- The girl?

08:37.390 --> 08:39.101
- What do you really
want this money for?

08:39.184 --> 08:40.686
- A mini-skirt,
some nice boots,

08:40.770 --> 08:42.647
and tickets to
the Pharrell concert

08:42.730 --> 08:44.273
where I'll be
wearing them.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.150
- Pharrell!
- Mm-hm.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.194
- Oh, I like him.
He makes me...

08:48.277 --> 08:50.112
♪ Happy ♪

08:50.196 --> 08:51.781
- So, you'll give
me the money?

08:51.864 --> 08:54.283
- I said he makes
me happy, not crazy.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.456
- Okay, one more time.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.458
Where is your cavity?
- Baby tooth.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.793
- And what happens
to baby teeth?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.128
- They fall out.
But mine's hardly loose.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.964
- That's where I come in
with this time-honored

09:08.047 --> 09:09.715
scientific method
I've seen work

09:09.799 --> 09:12.468
a thousand times
in cartoons.

09:12.551 --> 09:16.472
Here, tie this string
to your tooth.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.099
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

09:18.182 --> 09:21.143
Hold up there, Wiley Coyote.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.396
- What are you thinking?

09:23.479 --> 09:26.816
- I'm just trying to spare
my brother excruciating pain.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.068
I have the video game
Dental Dungeon

09:29.151 --> 09:31.904
and the desert-keeper's
drill is like this long.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.155
- James.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.657
- And the drill goes
like...Annnhhhh!

09:34.740 --> 09:37.535
- James.
- And one guy's face exploded!

09:37.618 --> 09:40.204
- Get the rock!
- No, no, no!

09:40.288 --> 09:41.747
Nobody's getting any rock.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.041
- Well, nobody's getting
in my mouth either.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.209
- That's not your call.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.712
We're the parents. We'll decide
what's best for you.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.171
- Charlie, let me.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.215
Aaron, you know I would
never ask you to do something

09:51.299 --> 09:53.175
I would not do.
- That's right. She wouldn't.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.219
- And remember how I said
I'll be there with you

09:55.303 --> 09:56.887
every step of the way,
no matter what?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.180
- That's right.
No matter what.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.181
- So you and I,
together...

09:59.265 --> 10:03.311
won't go.
- Exactly. What?

10:09.108 --> 10:11.193
- You know the only reason
Aaron's not getting

10:11.277 --> 10:13.738
his cavity filled is because
you won't go in for yours.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.240
- I don't have to go.
I'm using positive thinking.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.660
My tooth is healing itself.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.164
- Yeah. Because that happens.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.249
- Oh, you medical
professionals think

10:25.333 --> 10:28.252
you know all about
the human body.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.213
- That's why they let us carry
the shiny stethoscope.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.381
Though there is still
the occasional mystery.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.801
Like why is my butt
suddenly cold?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.386
- I don't know.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.181
Why don't you find that shiny
stethoscope and check it out?

10:42.808 --> 10:43.809
- Oh.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.563
- What? I get hungry in
the middle of the night.

10:47.646 --> 10:50.524
- Frozen peas?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.777
Okay, don't let
me stop you.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.071
Snack away.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.239
- Are you sure you wanna
make me do this?

10:57.323 --> 11:00.368
Because when trust
leaves a marriage...

11:00.451 --> 11:02.411
- I believe in us.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.498
Eat the peas.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.583
Mmmm.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.418
Mm-hm.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.878
Mm-hmmm...

11:14.465 --> 11:16.592
Oh, stop, stop.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.469
How's Aaron ever gonna learn
to conquer his fears

11:18.552 --> 11:20.763
when you run away
from yours?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.848
- I don't have any fears.

11:22.932 --> 11:27.728
- Hm.
- [chomps]

11:27.812 --> 11:29.105
- Good?

11:29.188 --> 11:31.524
- Delicious.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.567
And pain free.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.237
I can chew all night.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.533
- Great, because I have
got your favorite right here--

11:40.616 --> 11:42.326
peanut brittle!

11:42.410 --> 11:45.371
- It looks too good to eat.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.420
- That's right, a thousand
dark chocolate truffles

11:52.503 --> 11:53.796
by tomorrow afternoon.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.215
Half monogrammed with
a "W", half with a "K".

11:56.298 --> 11:57.633
And it's, uh,
$600, right?

11:57.716 --> 12:01.762
- I'm sorry, cancel that.
The wedding's off.

12:01.846 --> 12:06.725
It turns out W was on
the DL with K's BFF.

12:06.809 --> 12:11.272
- What are you doing?
Steph's gonna pay me $40.

12:11.355 --> 12:15.860
- Chump change. I got a plan
to make us some real money.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.361
- What do you need
money for?

12:17.445 --> 12:20.197
- Atlantic City, baby.

12:20.281 --> 12:26.328
My prayer circle and I are gonna
put our powers to the test.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.205
So, here's the plan.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.832
You and I go to
the 89 cent store.

12:29.915 --> 12:36.464
Spend $20 on some cheap
candy, glitter pens, boom!

12:36.547 --> 12:38.424
Monogrammed chocolate.

12:38.507 --> 12:42.303
- Oh, and we pocket
the left over money.

12:42.386 --> 12:47.600
- That's right,
you and I split $580!

12:47.683 --> 12:49.351
- BOTH: [laughing]

12:49.435 --> 12:52.688
- Did I hear something
in the mid three figures?

12:52.771 --> 12:55.858
- This is not your scam.
Keep walking.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.068
- Your confidence
is adorable.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.447
What are you two doing?

13:01.530 --> 13:04.408
- Something psychopathic.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.577
- Not psychopathic,
homeopathic.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.455
- Are you sure this
stuff will work?

13:09.538 --> 13:10.623
- Absolutely.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.583
In ancient times, long before
there were any dentists,

13:12.666 --> 13:13.167
do you know how
they cured a toothache?

13:13.250 --> 13:16.378
- Whiskey?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.839
- No, and that his horribly
inappropriate.

13:18.923 --> 13:19.632
Where would you even
get that idea?

13:19.715 --> 13:22.051
- I saw it in
a cowboy movie.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.260
- Did it work?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.387
- I don't know.
They hung the guy.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.475
- All right,
back to my plan.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.393
Nature's medicine.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.478
- Oil of Cloves?

13:32.561 --> 13:36.565
- Yep, two drops
on your gum.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.233
All right,
open up, kiddo.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.402
- You, first.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.154
- Okay, maybe we'll
pass on that one.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
All right,
let's try this one.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.450
It's an herbal poultice.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.495
It has sage, thyme,
and rosemary.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.331
Huh, you can season
a turkey with this.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.960
Wait, this is
turkey seasoning.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.753
- I like cranberry sauce.
Can we use that?

13:57.836 --> 13:59.088
- No.
- Turkey giblets?

13:59.171 --> 13:59.922
- No.
- Pumpkin pie?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.716
- We're not doing
Thanksgiving.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.344
- What else have you got
because my tooth

14:05.427 --> 14:08.389
is starting to hurt again.
- Oh, sweetie, mine, too.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.767
I've been eating
baby food for 24 hours.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.060
Do you know what?

14:13.143 --> 14:15.688
We both need to suck it
up and go see that dentist.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.022
- Can't we just try
that thing

14:17.106 --> 14:18.816
where James tied
my tooth to a rock?

14:18.899 --> 14:21.151
- Sorry, Aaron,
the rock was a bad idea.

14:21.235 --> 14:21.819
- Oh, thank you, James.

14:21.902 --> 14:25.698
- I'm thinking car bumper.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.328
- We're just gonna let
the gas get to work.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.122
And then we can
get started.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.165
- See? This isn't so bad.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.500
I'm sitting in
my spaceship chair,

14:36.584 --> 14:39.378
I've got my space
mask on,

14:39.461 --> 14:42.339
and I'm feeling pretty
good about the whole thing.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.343
Woo, I'm starting to feel real
good about the whole thing.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.095
- [high-pitched whirring]
- What's that?

14:48.178 --> 14:51.015
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
That's my scalpel hand.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.933
- You can play
with mine, Steph.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.395
Ow! Ow! Ow!
That's my tetherball hand.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.397
- You know what?
My tooth feels all better.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.482
You are amazing, Dr. Porter.
It's time to go.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.109
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

15:02.192 --> 15:03.944
I put two hours
in that marking meter.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.279
I want my money's worth.

15:05.362 --> 15:12.161
- Okay, I'm gonna turn this up
so we can get you more relaxed.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.579
- Oh...
[giggles]

15:13.662 --> 15:18.083
I don't think this
is working, Proctor Dorter.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.835
[giggling]

15:19.918 --> 15:24.757
You know, Charlie doesn't think
that dentists are real doctors.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.843
- He will when
he sees my bill.

15:27.926 --> 15:31.930
- See, Aaron, you have
nothing to worry about.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.642
- I know. My tooth fell
out this morning.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.185
- What?

15:36.268 --> 15:38.854
Charlie, did you
know about this?

15:38.937 --> 15:41.398
- More gas. More gas.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.488
- I'm done with my half.
- Me, too.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.239
- Five hundred
chocolate truffles

15:49.323 --> 15:53.035
monogrammed
with the letter "K".

15:53.118 --> 15:55.746
- "K"?
I was doing "K".

15:55.829 --> 15:57.373
- Nah-unh. When I said
do you want to do "W",

15:57.456 --> 15:59.541
you said okay.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.962
- No, I said "K"
as in I'll do "K".

16:04.046 --> 16:06.882
I don't wanna
do no "W".

16:06.965 --> 16:10.386
- We've got a thousand "Ks".
What are we supposed to do now?

16:10.469 --> 16:12.388
- Well, obviously, we're gonna
have to break up

16:12.471 --> 16:16.892
Kelly and Walter
and find her a Ken.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.395
Or a pretentious
Kristopher.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.646
- We're gonna have to
buy more chocolate

16:20.729 --> 16:21.855
and that's really gonna
cut into our profits.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.900
- Well, we would have
more profits,

16:24.983 --> 16:27.069
if somebody didn't
insist on

16:27.152 --> 16:29.613
our buying the "fancy"
cooking glitter.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.656
- The regular glitter
would kill you!

16:30.739 --> 16:34.076
- Oooh, you are
stressing me!

16:37.371 --> 16:40.082
I need some chocolate.
- Oh, have one with a "K".

16:40.165 --> 16:42.000
- [gasps]
Say "K" to me one more time.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.510
- Unh-unh.

16:51.593 --> 16:55.931
Does this taste
weird to you?

16:56.014 --> 16:58.100
- Kind of.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.728
Does it have
nuts in it?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.981
- It's not supposed to.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.691
- Then what's in my mouth?

17:05.773 --> 17:08.444
- I don't know, but I'm
trying to swallow

17:08.527 --> 17:10.612
and my body won't let me.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.702
- MAGGIE: Unh!

17:16.785 --> 17:17.786
- GABBY: [coughs]

17:17.869 --> 17:20.705
- Ooh, I feel like
I need to scrape my tongue.

17:20.789 --> 17:24.960
- You can still feel yours?

17:25.042 --> 17:28.297
- Oh, we can't serve this
89 cent stuff to anybody.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.382
We'd better call
the original chocolate shop.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.469
There's no way they'll be able
to fill this order by tonight.

17:33.552 --> 17:38.682
- Hello, ladies.
Is everything okay?

17:38.766 --> 17:42.352
Or should I say "K"?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.188
- You gonna taunt or help?

17:44.271 --> 17:45.063
- Why, I'm here to
help, of course.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.941
But, first,
a taunt in five parts.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.526
Part One: Robot.
You have failed.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.279
Terminate. Terminate.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.864
Part Two: Morse Code.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.073
- Get to the help part!

17:55.157 --> 17:58.994
- I can fix this whole
thing for a hundred dollars.

17:59.077 --> 18:00.579
- Only a hundred?
Including the chocolate?

18:00.662 --> 18:02.873
- A hundred for me.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.417
Then bring this purchase order
to the chocolate shop

18:05.501 --> 18:08.337
and pay another $600
when you pick it up.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.380
- How did you--
- Don't ask questions.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.717
We now accept
all major credit cards.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.385
- CHARLIE: Anybody home?

18:15.469 --> 18:16.762
- MAGGIE & GABBY: Oh!

18:16.845 --> 18:21.391
- Lookit, we are out.
Do not tell Stephanie.

18:21.475 --> 18:25.187
- [cackling laughter]

18:25.270 --> 18:27.231
- Some of us are only
half way back.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.525
- Oh, stop helping me.
I'm mad at you.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.236
Can't you tell?
[laughing]

18:32.319 --> 18:33.028
Oh, look at that nose.

18:33.111 --> 18:36.281
You've got a nose.
[laughing]

18:36.365 --> 18:37.783
- Yeah, for the eighth time,

18:37.866 --> 18:39.159
it's the same nose
I had in the car,

18:39.243 --> 18:41.078
the same nose
I had at the dentist.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.037
- Stephanie
got her tooth filled.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.665
Hey, Stephanie,
want some more water?

18:44.748 --> 18:46.792
- Oh, thank you,
Aaron, my...

18:46.875 --> 18:48.544
tiny toothless tot.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.380
- Watch this.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.013
- Aaron, would you
stop doing that.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.933
- Hey, Steph, can I get
you some milk?

19:03.016 --> 19:05.477
- Ooh, do grape juice.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.272
- Boys, knock it off.
She's not a fountain.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.731
Go upstairs.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.567
- Hey, Aaron, why aren't
you all loopy?

19:11.650 --> 19:15.070
- Ah, his tooth fell out
and Charlie didn't tell me.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.947
Why didn't ya tell
me, Charlie?

19:17.030 --> 19:20.284
- Because you were
conquering your fear

19:20.367 --> 19:22.411
and being such
a great role model.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.787
- Oh, that you
couldn't trust me

19:23.871 --> 19:28.125
to go to it through it
with my own to fix?

19:28.208 --> 19:31.128
That's right, I said it.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.005
- I'm not exactly sure
how to respond 'cause

19:33.088 --> 19:36.049
I'm not exactly
sure what was said.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.384
- Listen...

19:37.467 --> 19:38.427
when Charlie comes
back in this room,

19:38.510 --> 19:44.099
he and I are gonna have
a long trust about talk.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.229
Now bring me that nose.
- Ow!

19:52.816 --> 19:55.777
Hey, honey, do you want the last
piece of peanut brittle?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.530
- I can't. I already
started my regimen.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.448
Floss. Water Pick.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.783
Four minutes with
the electric toothbrush.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.454
These fluoride trays
and finish with mouth wash.

20:05.537 --> 20:10.751
And then I do the same
thing for my upper row.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.296
- Wow, isn't it easier to
just go to the dentist

20:14.379 --> 20:15.839
when you realize
you have a problem?

20:15.923 --> 20:17.883
- No, no, no. You don't
understand, Charlie.

20:17.966 --> 20:22.179
This way, I'll never
have a problem.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.722
- More peanut
brittle for me.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.183
[tooth cracks]
Ooooh!

20:26.266 --> 20:28.143
- STEPHANIE:
Is something wrong?

20:28.226 --> 20:29.770
- No!

20:31.146 --> 20:47.079
