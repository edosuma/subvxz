00:43.334 --> 00:44.669
Annie, are you okay?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.672
Not now, Owen.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.429
[Mantleray] What? What? They're awake?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.181
They're not dead?

00:57.140 --> 00:59.267
They're alive. You woke up!

00:59.726 --> 01:00.935
Were we not supposed to?

01:01.811 --> 01:03.354
-Hello.
-Congratulations.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.149
-So nice of you to come.
-Congratulations.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.027
-Good to see you. You look wonderful.
-Congratulations.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.071
Hello, hello. So good to see you, yes.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.239
Are you feeling pure, unaffected joy?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.746
Why are they all staring at us?

01:19.829 --> 01:22.791
-[D'Nail] Like we're in a zoo.
-[Raymond] No, like cattle...

01:23.291 --> 01:24.375
in a slaughterhouse.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.045
Fuck the Evens.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.005
I'm a big fan. I have all your books.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.424
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.220
You've just completed
the 73rd iteration...

01:36.012 --> 01:36.971
of the ULP.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.141
It's been a complete success.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.103
Congratulations.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.438
You're healed.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.408

01:58.743 --> 02:02.705
You can speak to them that way,
but you cannot speak to me that way.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.917
Perhaps you know me from my books,
my radio program.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.877

02:14.676 --> 02:16.761

That's not true.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.639

02:28.940 --> 02:31.985
You stole my mind from me for profit.

02:32.068 --> 02:35.613
The combination of hubris and idiocy
is inconceivable.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.448
<i>I agree.</i>

02:37.532 --> 02:42.412
I advise that you never allow my son
to practice in this industry again.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.386
I believe I've...

02:59.470 --> 03:01.389
said everything that I...

03:02.515 --> 03:03.641
needed to say.

03:07.937 --> 03:08.771
Fine.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.196
-Well, Mother, I...
-Yes.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.989
-I suppose...
-Yes.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.619
You and I could share a very brief...

03:23.703 --> 03:25.538

03:27.165 --> 03:28.625
-I'm leaving the country.
-Oh.

03:28.708 --> 03:33.046
I'm going on a 47-city book tour,
all seven continents.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.005
Oh.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.759
So you and I won't
be seeing each other again...

03:39.093 --> 03:39.928

03:40.929 --> 03:42.055

03:43.348 --> 03:44.182

05:00.842 --> 05:01.676
What?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.304
I won't make more of this than it was.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.101
I didn't think you were going to.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.604
I have a problem with that. I...

05:14.605 --> 05:16.149
I get weird.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.610
Okay.

I know it wasn't easy to bring me back.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.730
It was the only choice.

05:56.814 --> 06:00.360
The calculation failed, but I believe
it would have failed in any case.

06:01.819 --> 06:06.824
I was the one who created an...
intolerable situation for Gertie.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.746

was remarkable...

06:49.075 --> 06:51.744
I'm starting to think that your kiss,

Yes.

07:19.814 --> 07:20.690
A fantasy.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.360

against the wealthy

12:31.167 --> 12:33.711
-Absolutely not.
-And have you ever--

12:33.794 --> 12:36.213
-We have a new settlement offer.
-What terms?

12:36.839 --> 12:37.757
Generous.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.260
How many times do I have to tell you guys?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.304
We are not settling.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.221
[Owen] Why not?

12:44.305 --> 12:45.890
Because it's bullshit. That's why.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.976
Then I wouldn't have to lie under oath.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.605
Look, this is a one-time thing.

Any settlement will ruin our family name.

to forgive Jed

13:03.324 --> 13:05.159

13:05.242 --> 13:09.288

will rip it out of her chest cavity.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.230
[Owen] I buzzed him up at 7:05.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.568
I know the time
because he's always five minutes late,

14:21.068 --> 14:22.945
and I asked him to be there at seven.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.406
And I know we were there for four hours

14:25.489 --> 14:28.617
because that's how long
it takes me to beat him at Risk.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.119
[laughter]

14:30.202 --> 14:35.916
So, is it possible for Jed Milgrim
to have been at the office at 8:25?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.670
Not unless someone could be two places
at the same time.

14:40.087 --> 14:43.591
Objection, Your Honor.
There is no real documented time line.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.552
-[judge] Overruled.
-[Frank] No further questions, Your Honor.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.472
Nobody can be two places at once,

14:51.223 --> 14:53.017
but everyone has to be somewhere.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.435
Do you agree, Mr. Milgrim?

14:57.521 --> 14:59.148
I don't understand the question.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.735
You have no data portals
in your micro apartment.

aren't you?

15:15.456 --> 15:16.332
Sure.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.667
Then let's see something visible.

of my father's company.

That's the stairwell
of my father's company.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.065

15:41.982 --> 15:43.984
[Owen] I see a man groping a woman.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.695
[lawyer] This is the man

15:46.779 --> 15:48.656
who used his power in the workplace

15:48.739 --> 15:52.159
to force my client
into a heinous sexual act.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.805
[courtroom murmurs]

16:19.645 --> 16:21.563
[lawyer] The defense's entire case

16:22.106 --> 16:24.608
rests on you not believing
your very own eyes,

16:24.692 --> 16:26.860
and instead believing Owen Milgrim.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.781
Mr. Milgrim, were you diagnosed
with schizophrenia ten years ago?

16:30.864 --> 16:33.867
[Frank] Objection.
Irrelevant and prejudicial, Your Honor.

16:33.951 --> 16:34.994
[judge] Overruled.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.829
Answer the question Mr. Milgrim.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.249
[lawyer] Are you schizophrenic,
Mr. Milgrim?

16:42.584 --> 16:43.460
[clears throat]

16:43.544 --> 16:44.378
Yes.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.715
[lawyer] Are you on any
anti-psychotic medications?

16:48.924 --> 16:52.094
I'm supposed to be,
but I stopped taking them a while ago.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.805
[lawyer] Do you ever get confused
about your brother, Jed?

16:54.888 --> 16:57.474
As in you believe you're seeing him,

16:57.558 --> 17:01.353
when, in fact, you are imagining
someone who just looks like him.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.647
[Owen] Not anymore.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.735
And do you have trouble telling
the difference between what is real

17:08.277 --> 17:09.486
and what's not?

17:09.570 --> 17:10.487
[clears throat]

17:12.072 --> 17:14.491
-Sometimes I do, yes.
-[Frank] Objection, Your Honor,

17:14.575 --> 17:16.702
the witness is clearly having
a panic attack--

17:16.785 --> 17:19.872
I would like to submit my testimony.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.083
[lawyer] As I said before,

17:23.167 --> 17:27.588
this entire case rests
on what Mr. Milgrim thinks of this image.

17:28.505 --> 17:32.593
Does this man
look like your brother, Jed Milgrim?

17:36.513 --> 17:37.765
It doesn't look like him.

17:38.932 --> 17:39.850
See? I told you.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.021
It is him.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.524
[man] What the fuck did he just say?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.152
It's obviously him.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.487
Motherfucker.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.821
[lawyer] Just to clarify,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.699
-your brother wasn't with you--
-I'm saying I lied, and he's guilty,

17:56.283 --> 17:58.452
and he's a monster,
and I'm sorry for lying.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.746
I'm not a liar.
He's guilty and he did it.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.916
-[lawyer] No further questions.
-[Frank] Your Honor, I move to redirect

18:03.999 --> 18:06.001
and treat Mr. Milgrim
as a hostile witness.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.420
[judge] It's too late, Counsel.
You've already examined him.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.713
Motion denied.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.049
[Frank] No further questions, Your Honor.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.595
You're dead. You're fucking dead.
I'm gonna kill you.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.180
I'm gonna kill you my fucking self.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.973
[yelling] I'm gonna fucking kill you!

18:20.057 --> 18:23.352
[gavel pounds]

18:25.187 --> 18:26.230
[birds chirping]

19:02.391 --> 19:03.851
I need to tell you something.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.605
I need to tell you
that it's not okay for me...

19:10.065 --> 19:10.941
out here...

19:11.942 --> 19:14.820
all by myself.
It was before, but it's not anymore.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.410
Yes, you married a woman...

19:22.494 --> 19:23.537
who was sick.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.292
And she couldn't handle having a family,
and she left us.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.377
And it broke your heart.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.422
And then your daughter died.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.259
And it was the wrong one.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.721
It was the easier one...

19:41.597 --> 19:42.806
who was good at life. Who made you laugh.

19:48.478 --> 19:51.106
Who didn't cause problems,
who always called you.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.651
Who didn't remind you of her mother.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.991
And it's okay that you had to go in there,
but I don't accept it anymore.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.078
I need you out here.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.165
We are the only ones left.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.376
I need you out here with me, Dad.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.051
-I'm lonely.
-I take it your trip to Salt Lake...

20:19.968 --> 20:21.261
opened things up.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.557
What are you doing?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.184
Annie, I don't think that,

20:27.267 --> 20:29.478
what you said about the wrong one.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.521
I don't... I don't think that.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.776
Did you steal all my money?

20:38.153 --> 20:39.238
I can pay you back.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.532
When I saw how much you took,
I figured you weren't coming back.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.867
I just figured, well...

20:44.534 --> 20:45.577
there it is.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.373
The third and final Irish exit.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.666
I'm sorry.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.126
Don't be.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.129
How was it?

20:57.297 --> 20:58.340
I didn't go.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.301
Not technically.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.430
[Hank] Your brain is not melted, at least.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.474
It would have been painless, I heard.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.060
According to the, uh...

21:11.353 --> 21:13.021
insane computer.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.564
[grunts]

21:14.648 --> 21:16.066
She was going through a lot.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.820
Well...

21:23.323 --> 21:24.574
You seem good, Annie.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.034
I don't feel good. How is she? How did...

21:29.246 --> 21:31.248
-How'd she seem?
-Who?

21:32.916 --> 21:33.834
Ellie.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.420
Um...

21:36.670 --> 21:38.338
None of that was real.

21:39.464 --> 21:43.427
You get that.
I just... made up a version of her.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.637
Maybe but, you know,

21:45.929 --> 21:48.098
who really knows how this stuff works.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.559
So, how'd she seem?

21:53.937 --> 21:55.314
She seemed like herself.

21:57.774 --> 21:58.608
Good.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.614
Anything come to you
in the last three days?

22:05.198 --> 22:06.700
I don't know. I think so.

22:10.245 --> 22:13.498
But honestly, I feel confused.
I feel like maybe I did it wrong.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.961
Owen listened to all of my stories.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.674
But in the reflections, I kept giving him
all these reasons not to trust me,

22:23.091 --> 22:25.302
but he just... kept trying to help me.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.221
He acted like a friend.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.854
[woman] <i>I want to talk to you</i>
<i>about something</i>

22:35.937 --> 22:37.898
<i>you've been avoiding since you got here.</i>

22:38.398 --> 22:39.232
Okay.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.320
You talked about what happened
at the drug trial,

22:43.403 --> 22:46.490
and you talked about
what you went through with your family,

22:46.573 --> 22:50.243
but I still don't understand why you never
tried to talk to Annie again.

22:50.952 --> 22:54.998
Because there were two options,
and neither could end well.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.085
What are the two options?

22:58.627 --> 23:01.421
Option A, she doesn't really exist.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.717
I look up her name,
figure out where she lives,

23:06.510 --> 23:09.012
and realize there's no one on Earth
with that name.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.557
Next, I go
to Neberdine Pharmaceutical Bio Tech

23:12.641 --> 23:17.687
and find out there's no such thing
as Neberdine Pharmaceutical Bio Tech.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.439
What about option B?

23:21.441 --> 23:22.943
Option B's even worse.

23:31.618 --> 23:32.786
[Annie] <i>Owen, look.</i>

23:32.869 --> 23:34.746
<i>I was so focused on my own shit.</i>

23:35.288 --> 23:37.124
I should have said I care about you,

23:37.958 --> 23:42.170
and that after everything we've been
through, I can't not have you in my life.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.966
Because it's really hard...

23:46.675 --> 23:48.844
to actually just connect with somebody.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.680
And... when you do...

23:52.722 --> 23:55.475
you don't... You can't just run away.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.352
[man] Hey, Annie...

23:58.019 --> 23:59.521
you don't have to explain it.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.233
I know how special our connection is.

24:04.734 --> 24:08.488
It means so much to me that you would
ask me to come with you to San...

24:09.114 --> 24:10.323
to Salt Lake City.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.286
[Annie] Hmm.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.582
Uh, Annie, I love you.

24:19.666 --> 24:23.003
And I'm not gonna let my schizophrenia
get in the way

24:23.086 --> 24:26.339
of these two big, beautiful beating hearts

24:26.423 --> 24:28.675
because we're meant to be together.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.052
Anna, I, uh...

24:31.845 --> 24:33.180
-Um...
-[Annie] What are you doing?

24:33.263 --> 24:35.140
-Annie.
-No, no. You know what? No.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.683
Will you marry me?

24:36.766 --> 24:37.601
[Annie] No.

24:37.684 --> 24:38.518
-What?
-No? No.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.397
-Just stop.
-Oh, I guess I misread the file.

24:43.690 --> 24:46.776
Yeah, it's not like that at all,
and you're doing him wrong.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.862
It needs to feel like pain,

24:49.237 --> 24:51.031
but not an awful kind of pain.

24:51.114 --> 24:54.493
It's like this low-level sadness
that has a lot of...

24:55.327 --> 24:57.621
caring and sweetness underneath it.

24:57.704 --> 24:58.580
Forget it.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.499
That's a lot to remember, but, uh...

25:00.916 --> 25:02.125
Are you firing me?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.252
[man] I can't lose another one, fuck.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.632
This is...

25:10.550 --> 25:11.843
This is real Owen.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.349
Oh, they had me committed? There's no way this is a coincidence.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.687
This... This is a sign, Friend Proxy Owen.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.650
Maybe the universe isn't total chaos.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.568
That's comforting.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.488
Let's do this.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.739
[engine turns over]

25:34.074 --> 25:34.908
Hey!

25:35.325 --> 25:37.369
Oh, I wasn't going to get in any way.

25:37.994 --> 25:38.954
Cue the music.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.581
There she goes.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.292
-[gear grinds]
-[man] Okay, can't really drive stick.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.628
[man] Stuck in Bushwick.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.131
[exhales] God, I hate my fucking life.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.049
[gear grinds] Hello.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.360
Would you sign in
and check your bag, please?

26:10.443 --> 26:11.278
Oh, sure.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.531
For you, sir.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.576
-Hey, there.
-Hello. Just here to visit my niece.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.248
My husband is already inside, so...

26:23.582 --> 26:25.250
I'm late. I'm in trouble.

26:31.631 --> 26:32.966
-Here you go. Thank you.
-All good?

26:33.049 --> 26:34.884
-Okay, where should I go?
-Right here.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.970
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

27:05.957 --> 27:06.916
What are you doing?

27:07.876 --> 27:10.503
-What the fuck are you doing here, Owen?
-Moving benches.

27:17.844 --> 27:18.720
[Annie clears throat]

27:18.803 --> 27:21.222
-My family had me committed.
-I know that, idiot.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.932
I mean, what are you doing in <i>here?</i>

27:23.016 --> 27:24.893
This isn't even a state-run facility.

27:25.393 --> 27:26.311
I'm crazy.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.191
[Owen coughs]

27:31.274 --> 27:32.942
You're not fucking crazy, Owen.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.362
Come on, you're just kind of crazy.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.116
I made some threats to powerful people.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.619
I sent anthrax to the governor.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.454
Your brother did that.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.456
I had a blip...

27:47.040 --> 27:49.584
in college. I should be here. I'm sick.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.502
Okay.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.587
Maybe you're diagnosed,

27:53.046 --> 27:54.673
maybe you need to be medicated,

27:54.756 --> 27:55.799
but this...

27:57.342 --> 27:59.427
This does not work for me, Owen.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.847
I don't think it works for you either.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.601
So you saw some things
that weren't there. So what?

28:06.976 --> 28:11.022
People see aliens, people hear voices,
people see ghosts.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.357
That's different.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.528
My mind, it...

28:17.237 --> 28:20.031
-It doesn't work right.
-No one's does.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.373
I'm gonna go into that bathroom
right there...

28:29.666 --> 28:30.917
and 30 seconds later,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.294
you're gonna go into that bathroom.

28:33.837 --> 28:34.754
You get me?

28:35.672 --> 28:36.506
No.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.341
What is the problem?

28:38.800 --> 28:39.801
I'm afraid.

28:39.884 --> 28:40.719
Of what?

28:43.346 --> 28:44.347
Option B.

28:48.643 --> 28:51.813
Annie, the same thing happens
every time I meet someone

28:51.896 --> 28:53.356
or get close to someone.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.233
I mess it up.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.072
I'm gonna get frustrated...

29:01.990 --> 29:04.325
one day, and yell at you out of nowhere,

29:04.617 --> 29:07.829
over something insignificant
I'm fixated on.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.500
And then you'll stop calling back.

29:14.294 --> 29:17.255
And you'll change your number
and it'll break my heart.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.638
It's just easier if you're not real.

29:27.891 --> 29:28.850
But I am real.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.436
You know me.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.941
You're braver than this, Owen.

29:38.234 --> 29:40.445
And I will never do that to you.

29:41.362 --> 29:42.197
Never.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.118
Thirty seconds.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.247
[Owen clears his throat]

29:53.041 --> 29:53.958
[sniffs]

29:55.502 --> 29:56.628
Thirty seconds.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.298
[clears throat]

30:15.855 --> 30:16.856
Hey.

30:16.940 --> 30:17.816
Come in here.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.234
Come on.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.235
Lock the door.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.875
Our niece is out there.
We were visiting.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.253
She's the one dancing by the wall.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.839
It was a great visit,
but, you know, it's over now.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.382
And you're Bruce.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.384
I'm Linda.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.178
Sorry these are weird. They're my dad's.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.473
Owen, I saw this in a movie. It works.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.809
Here.

30:58.731 --> 30:59.691
Put 'em on.

31:02.902 --> 31:03.820
Owen.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.113
[Owen clears his throat]

31:15.915 --> 31:17.166
Annie, why are you here?

31:19.127 --> 31:20.336
Because I'm your friend.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.009
And that's what friends do.

31:28.928 --> 31:29.804
Okay.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.612
Hey.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.030
Didn't you come in alone?

31:48.197 --> 31:50.116
No, we were together.
You're seeing things.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.452
Uh, I'm pretty sure you came in alone.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.164
I'm pretty sure she came in alone.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.582
Uh...

31:59.500 --> 32:00.919
Let me see the sign in sheet.

32:02.962 --> 32:06.257
-Is that the truck?
-Yes, yes, my dad gave it to me.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.175
Just get in.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.010
Let's go, come on. Go, go, go.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.562
It's open! Get in!

32:20.605 --> 32:22.565
That's Harpo. She's a rescue.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.069
-Dammit.
-What's wrong?

32:26.152 --> 32:29.113
This just happens
when I try to start cars.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.283
Owen, will you go
to Salt Lake City with me? I don't technically have
a driver's license.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.164
Yes! You've gotta start the car, though.

32:38.247 --> 32:39.165
Okay. Okay.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.208
-[engine turns over]
-Go!

32:40.291 --> 32:42.210
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.548
Annie, be careful!

32:48.341 --> 32:49.384
Go, go!

32:50.134 --> 32:51.094
Hey, hey!

32:51.636 --> 32:52.470
Hey, hey, stop!

32:54.722 --> 32:55.890
Annie, be careful!

32:56.391 --> 32:57.517
I got it. We're good.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.018
Shit, I missed the exit.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.068
Hey! Stop!

33:07.151 --> 33:09.654
Let go! We're good.
We're fine. We're fine. Bye!

33:11.656 --> 33:12.532
[man] Stop!

33:17.036 --> 33:17.996
This is it.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.206
This is it.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.122
[Mantleray] <i>It's a ridiculous theory.</i>

34:01.205 --> 34:03.291
<i>More something my mother</i>
<i>would have cooked up.</i>

34:03.374 --> 34:05.835
-[Azumi] <i>I'd like to hear it.</i>
-[Mantleray] <i>Oh, you would?</i>

34:05.918 --> 34:09.422
-[Azumi] <i>It's a long way to Newfoundland.</i>
-[Mantleray] <i>Okay, yes. Well...</i>

34:09.505 --> 34:11.549
<i>it begins like this.</i>

34:11.632 --> 34:14.677
<i>Two billion years ago, an amoeba...</i>

34:15.762 --> 34:17.597
[Owen] <i>How far away is Salt Lake City?</i>

34:18.639 --> 34:19.640
[Annie] <i>It's far.</i>

34:20.683 --> 34:22.226
<i>And I'm not entirely sure</i>

34:22.310 --> 34:24.562
<i>this truck is gonna be able to get us</i>
<i>the whole way there,</i>

34:24.645 --> 34:26.606
<i>but, you know, we'll get there one day.</i>

34:28.983 --> 34:30.735
[Owen] <i>Do we actually know each other?</i>
