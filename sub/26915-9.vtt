[bleating]

00:21.855 --> 00:23.022
Hey.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.859
Are Skye and Puzzle still out there?

00:25.942 --> 00:29.154
Puzzle's been doing great.
Skye took him on a trail ride.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.658
She's taught that horse so much.
In such a short time, too.

00:33.742 --> 00:37.787
You know, she has got a real gift.
She'd be a great vet one day.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.373
-Ah.
-Oh!

00:40.457 --> 00:42.125
-Morning, Trish.
-Speedy!

00:42.500 --> 00:45.795
-So good to see you. Yes, it is.
-[Speedy barking]

00:45.879 --> 00:48.506
And it is so good to see you, too, Trish.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.468
Morning, Grandpa, Billy.
I have a favor to ask.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.385
Ask away.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.555
I've been getting ready
for my first riding competition.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.766
It's at Haversham Riding Academy
this afternoon.

00:57.849 --> 01:01.352
I know. You're going to do great.
You've become a good rider.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.270
Thanks, Billy.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.440
My mom's driving me to Haversham
for some last minute practice.

01:05.523 --> 01:08.902
Nobody's gonna be home with Speedy.
He still chews stuff when he's alone.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.238
No worries. We can take care of Speedy
for as long as you need.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.157
-He loves the ranch.
-Thanks! Gotta go.

01:15.658 --> 01:16.785
Good luck!

01:17.118 --> 01:20.663
We are gonna have so much fun.
Yes, we are.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.500
-[Speedy barking]
-Yes, we are gonna have so much fun.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.335
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

01:25.668 --> 01:27.629
Yes, we love to have fun.

Okay, Debbie. Calm down now.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.295
Hey, what's your name?

02:10.130 --> 02:10.964
Trish.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.634
I'm Brianna.
Are you riding in the competition?

02:15.135 --> 02:15.969
Yeah.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.515
[scoffs] I've won, like,
the last four times in our age group.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.933
Congratulations.

02:22.016 --> 02:25.436
It's my first time, actually,
in any kind of riding competition.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.439
You're kidding.
How long have you been riding?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.441
A couple of years.

02:30.692 --> 02:34.779
Wow. I've been riding since I was like 5.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.324
And you're going to ride that horse?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.993
A stable horse?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.995
-Yeah. Debbie.
-[nickers]

02:42.078 --> 02:43.913
I've been riding her in practice.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.708
Everybody in the competition
has their own horse.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.835
Except for you, I guess.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.295
-[Shelby] Hey, Brianna.
-Hey.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.590
-Are you getting to know our Trish?
-Yeah. Do you know Trish, too?

02:53.673 --> 02:56.634
Of course.
She's my Rescue Ranch colleague.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.470
I'll see you out there, Trish.

03:00.930 --> 03:05.184
Don't worry about her. You'll do fine.
You'll make Rescue Ranch proud today.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.812
She's right, though.
I don't have my own horse.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.898
I haven't been riding for very long.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.357
So what?

03:11.441 --> 03:13.526
You've been practicing a lot, right?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.485
[whinnies]

03:14.569 --> 03:17.030
Hey. Apollo's still grazing in the fields.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.658
If you want, I can give you a few pointers
because I'm not busy.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.036
Okay, sure.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.997
[birds chirping]

03:27.957 --> 03:30.043
I was watching you
with Puzzle this morning.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.421
That horse has really learned
to listen to you.

03:33.504 --> 03:37.383
Yeah. He's definitely changed a lot
since he first came to us.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.803
I wasn't sure
if he'd ever be relaxed or happy.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.766
-You're a good trainer, Skye.
-Thanks, Mom.

03:45.266 --> 03:49.020
-So can I keep him?
-[chuckles] We will see about that.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.230
-Here, look.
-[beeps]

03:51.189 --> 03:54.067
Penny was telling me about her new client.
Silvia Jacobs.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.695
I've heard of her.
She's into trick riding, isn't she?

03:57.779 --> 04:01.491
She actually rides Western and does
a bit of Rodeo like your Aunt Courtney.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.160
It's a little more disciplined
than trick riding.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.373
So Silvia is actually training
for those big arena competitions.

04:09.040 --> 04:09.874
That's her?

04:09.958 --> 04:13.795
[scoffs] That's her. She's only 20.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.215
-Wow, she's really good.
-Oh, she sure is.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.135
Actually, if you'd like to meet with her,

04:21.219 --> 04:23.721
Penny said she'd be happy
to set something up.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.141
Silvia said she could meet with you
and maybe show you a few things.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.395
-I'd love that.
-She'll be at Haversham this afternoon.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.896
Haversham?

04:31.980 --> 04:35.566
Why would a Western-riding rodeo girl
be at English-riding Haversham?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.944
I asked the exact same thing.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.905
Silva is actually a very accomplished
English rider.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.741
Plus, she took her first riding lessons
at Haversham.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.953
Plus, she's going to be a judge
in today's competition.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.873
Works for me. I'm going to Haversham
later to watch Trish anyway.

04:53.584 --> 04:56.462
You know, Mom, I really do enjoy training,

04:56.546 --> 05:01.301
and I've been thinking,
I might wanna be a trainer one day.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.970
Skye, you'd be a very good trainer.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.597
And maybe you could even teach riding.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.351
Yeah. And maybe even, you know,
have my own place.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.687
What do you mean?

05:12.812 --> 05:15.523
Honey, you've already got your own place.
The ranch is ours.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.651
I know.
The future is confusing, that's all.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.739
I've been thinking a lot
about veterinary medicine,

05:22.822 --> 05:27.035
but I've also been thinking
about other careers, like being a trainer.

05:27.118 --> 05:31.122
Mom, what if I don't become a vet
like Grandpa?

05:31.748 --> 05:35.084
-I'm afraid of hurting his feelings.
-Oh, honey. I...

05:35.168 --> 05:38.296
I'm sure Grandpa would love
to discuss this with you.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.176
Maybe. I don't know how to tell him
I'm thinking about other careers.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.386
I feel like I'd be disappointing him.

05:45.845 --> 05:46.888
Hey.

05:47.722 --> 05:51.350
You will never disappoint
either one of us. Okay?

05:51.434 --> 05:54.812
But you know we'd both be very happy
if you went to college

05:54.896 --> 05:57.065
and got a degree to become a veterinarian.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.818
It's all about living up to our potential.

06:00.902 --> 06:01.986
[Grandpa] Hey, guys.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.988
Lunch time.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.200
Who wants a grilled cheese sandwich?

06:07.784 --> 06:08.951
-Yeah.
-Me, please.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.330
Isn't Speedy with you, Grandpa?

06:12.497 --> 06:16.000
No. He was racing around the paddock
a while ago.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.752
He knows his way around the ranch.

06:18.127 --> 06:21.172
Yes, but we should keep
an eye out for him.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.342
Don't you worry. He'll be barking
at that door before you know it.

06:26.928 --> 06:27.929
See?

06:28.012 --> 06:29.263
-[Speedy barking]
-[laughs]

06:29.347 --> 06:33.226
A dog knows how to open doors.
That is one smart dog.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.811
[Skye] Hi, Speedy.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.771
[whimpers]

06:36.854 --> 06:40.942
Hey... Um, Pops, it looks like
he's favoring that front paw a little.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.611
-[whimpers]
-Looks like he's favoring it a lot.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.197
[Grandpa] Oh, dear. [sighs]

06:47.073 --> 06:48.407
Let's see.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.787
Oh. Looks like he's cut his pad.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.373
I'm gonna get him up to the barn and...

06:55.748 --> 06:58.084
see if we can see
what we're dealing with here.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.045
-What'd you get into, eh?
-[whimpers]

07:01.129 --> 07:04.799
He must've stepped on something sharp,
some broken glass maybe.

07:05.174 --> 07:08.136
We should go and look for it
before the other animals get hurt.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.178
-Yeah.
-[Skye] Yeah.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.890
Ah. Let's get you taken care of.
Here we go.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.733
[whimpers]

07:27.905 --> 07:32.243
Speedy, you are gonna be good as new.
That's my boy.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.413
[whimpers]

07:35.913 --> 07:38.708
How's he doing? Does he need stitches?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.461
No. It's a just a superficial cut.

07:41.836 --> 07:45.339
That's lucky. We have to keep it
clean, watch for signs of infection.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.716
Can I put the bandage on?

07:49.010 --> 07:52.346
Here you go. This is good practice for you
for when you become a vet.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.973
-Yeah.
-[Speedy whimpers]

07:55.558 --> 07:57.268
You know what? You finish up.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.730
And I'm gonna take a look around,
see if I can find what he stepped on.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.940
I already found it. [sighs]

08:03.024 --> 08:05.318
It's a hoof pick, and it's sharp.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.696
It looks like he knocked some things over
near where I found it.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.948
[sighs]

08:11.032 --> 08:14.827
I keep my tools stored safely in my shop.
Where'd you find this?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.537
On the floor of your shop.

08:17.413 --> 08:20.082
But how did Speedy get in there?
The door is closed.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.211
He's pretty good
at opening doors, remember?

08:24.086 --> 08:28.007
Speedy, you are your own worst enemy.
This is all my fault.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.842
Oh, I'm sure he forgives you.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.136
How did you know to go in the shop?

08:32.595 --> 08:36.933
I did some detective work.
I just followed Speedy's footprints.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.811
Your powers of deduction
are gonna make you a great vet.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.855
Uh, yeah.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.860
-[horse neighing in distance]
-[whimpers]

08:48.110 --> 08:49.153
All done.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.406
Now we just have to make sure
he doesn't bite at it.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.407
Mm-hm.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.618
I'm afraid we're gonna have to put on...

08:55.701 --> 08:57.036
-The Cone.
-The Cone.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.371
-[both laugh]
-[Speedy barks]

08:58.454 --> 08:59.956
Oops. I think he heard you.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.958
-Only for a couple days.
-Yeah.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.460
-[Speedy whimpering]
-Attaboy.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.337
-He's a good boy.
-Yeah.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.297
Very brave.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.968
-And you did a great job.
-Thanks.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.106
-[Debbie whinnying]
-[Trish] Debbie, no.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.316
[nickers]

09:28.442 --> 09:32.446
What's wrong with her, Shelby?
She won't do anything properly.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.824
She looks like she's having a bad day.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.742
What am I doing wrong?

09:37.076 --> 09:38.160
I don't know.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.788
You haven't ridden Debbie very many times.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.165
Maybe she's just not comfortable
with you yet.

09:43.249 --> 09:47.336
She doesn't have time to get comfortable.
The competition is in a few hours.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.505
I don't know what to tell you.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.923
It's not your fault.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.509
She's obviously not going
to practice with me.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.928
I'm going to take her back to her stall.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.765
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go grab Apollo
for his exercise.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.101
See you later.
And thanks for trying to help.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.313
Hey, Trish, looking good out there.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.070
-Come on, guys.
-Huh?

10:13.154 --> 10:14.905
-Hi!
-Hmm.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.741
Why, good day.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.535
Uh... Hmm.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.250
Oh. [soft chuckle]

10:26.334 --> 10:29.670
-What are you guys doing here?
-Came to support you in the competition.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.339
You're always supporting all of us,

10:31.422 --> 10:33.924
so it's our turn to support you
for a change.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.635
[Olivia] We'll be your cheerleaders.

10:35.718 --> 10:39.305
After my game last night,
my dad and I, well, we went online

10:39.388 --> 10:41.557
and we found out how to make pom-poms.

10:42.266 --> 10:45.853
I don't see any pom-poms.
Did you forget to bring them?

10:45.936 --> 10:48.189
I have all the pom-pom materials
in my box.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.734
We just need to find somewhere to work.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.987
Okay. Bye, Trish.
See you at the competition.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.697
We'll be the ones with the pom-poms.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.823
[Ethan] Bye.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.204
[exhales] I can't do this.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.169
-Trish, where are you going?
-Home.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.254
But you've got the competition.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.298
[sighs]

11:14.465 --> 11:18.386
I can't do it. All the other girls
have been riding their whole lives.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.012
They have their own horses.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.973
I have an old horse
who doesn't even like me.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.934
I just-- I...

11:25.017 --> 11:26.435
I'm not good enough.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.520
Don't say that.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.438
It's true.

11:30.815 --> 11:34.193
Hey, uh, you've heard
of Silvia Jacobs, right?

11:34.610 --> 11:36.570
Of course. I heard she still comes here.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.282
Exactly. Penny arranged for me
to see Silvia today.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.743
She's gonna give me tips
on how to be a trainer.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.120
That's great.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.790
Come with me, please. I'm nervous.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.792
You're not nervous.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.628
It'll be fun.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.549
-Okay, sure. [chuckles]
-Okay, come on.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.050
One sec.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.640
-Be good.

[horse neighs]

12:08.644 --> 12:12.648
There's no more space.
All the rooms are occupied or locked up.

12:12.731 --> 12:16.026
Maybe we could just sit here
in the hallway and make the pom-poms.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.822
No, Isabella.
We need proper pom-pom-making facilities.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.073
[sighs]

12:21.449 --> 12:24.577
Hey, look. That must be the judges' table
for the competition.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.371
They won't be needing it for a while.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.040
It's perfect for pom-pom construction.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.584
Well, let's do it.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.085
[chuckling]

12:39.592 --> 12:41.010
[neighs]

12:41.802 --> 12:43.053
[Silvia] Good job.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.015
Let's make sure
we spread it out a little bit.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.685
Good job.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.729
Let's keep it safe.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.065
Stirrups on the balls of your feet.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.068
Just like that. That's great.

12:58.235 --> 13:02.239
-Wow. She's really good, isn't she?
-[sighs] She sure is.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.240
[Silvia] Good job.

13:03.324 --> 13:07.286
-[Trish] How old is she?
-[Skye] Well, my mom said she's only 20.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.539
She's not that much older than we are.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.418
-Inspiring, right?
-Yeah, that's pretty cool.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.794
Slow it down a bit.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.298

Oh, hi. You must be, um...

14:08.389 --> 14:11.892
Skye. And this is my friend, Trish.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.729
Nice to meet you. So, Skye,
you're interested in becoming a trainer?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.189
Maybe.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.025
Yeah, I mean, I wanna learn more about it.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.779
Our teacher said it's never too early
to start thinking about careers.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.989
Smart teacher.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.367
You're at the perfect age to start
asking questions and figuring it out.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.786
So, trainer is on your list, Skye?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.205
Trainer, veterinarian,

14:33.289 --> 14:35.708
and lots of other jobs
having to do with animals.

14:36.125 --> 14:40.004
It's confusing,
and then there's my family.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.297
Your family?

14:41.755 --> 14:44.008
I can't really talk to them about it.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.719
Mom wants me to live up to my potential.

14:46.802 --> 14:50.931
Grandpa, well, he wants me
to become a vet just like he was.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.559
They're just trying to give you
the best advice they can.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.603
I'm sure they just want
what's best for you.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.148
-Thanks, Silvia. I feel better already.
-[both chuckle]

15:02.067 --> 15:03.777
And what about you, Trish?

15:04.403 --> 15:07.781
Me? Oh, uh, I just help out
at Rescue Ranch.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.953
And she has her very first
riding competition in a few hours.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.496
Good for you.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.790
Thanks. But I don't think
I'm going to do it.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.042
Why not?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.836
The others have been riding
since they were little.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.504
They have their own horses.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.634
I'm supposed to be riding a stable horse,
and... I-I don't think we're a good team.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.219
-Which horse?
-Debbie.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.847
I love Debbie.
I used to ride her when I first started.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.266
She's a great horse
once you get to know her.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.351
Really?

15:35.434 --> 15:39.480
Yes. And you know, Trish, I didn't start
riding when I was a little kid either.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.650
I think I was only a couple of years older
than you when I started.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.360
That's incredible.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.736
[chuckles]

15:46.195 --> 15:49.823
It's amazing what you can do when you put
your mind to it and believe in yourself.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.825
You still have some time
for a warm up.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.120
Why don't you go get Debbie
and I'll meet you in the ring?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.873
Really? Yeah, thanks.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.586
[whinnies]

16:06.507 --> 16:09.426
Did we make too many pom-poms?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.553
Mm, I think so.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.639
I know what we can do with them.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.434
-Ooh.
-[chuckles]

16:22.982 --> 16:23.816
[Ethan chuckles]

16:24.066 --> 16:26.485
-[Isabella] Tape, anyone?
-[Olivia] Yes, please.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.198
Amazing.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.658
Hmm.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.702
-[Isabella] Perfect.
-Hmm.

16:40.582 --> 16:43.043
-Debbie, no.
-[whinnies]

16:43.127 --> 16:45.295
-[Trish] Ugh, I give up.
-[Debbie whinnies]

16:47.089 --> 16:51.051
Thanks for offering to help, Silvia,
but there's just no point.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.553
[chuckles]

16:54.221 --> 16:57.599
Hey, Debbie. How are you doing, girl?

16:58.934 --> 17:00.978
It's been too long, hasn't it?

17:02.730 --> 17:06.734
Obviously, she likes you.
But she sure doesn't like me.

17:06.817 --> 17:07.943
Debbie likes everybody.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.362
But she's a very sensitive horse.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.157
She's just picking up on your energy,
that's all.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.200
My energy?

17:15.743 --> 17:22.374
You're uptight, worried,
a little scared, maybe.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.835
She can feel it from your legs
on her sides,

17:24.918 --> 17:28.464
your hands on the reins,
she can hear it in your voice.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.050
-Really?
-You're anxious.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.801
And that makes her anxious.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.553
She's only worried about you, Trish.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.222
Makes sense to me.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.642
So, what do I do?

17:41.018 --> 17:42.311
Relax.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.438
What difference does it make
who's watching

17:44.521 --> 17:46.106
or how you do in the competition?

17:46.190 --> 17:50.944
The only thing that really matters
is that you and Debbie both have fun.

17:52.488 --> 17:56.617
-Okay, I'll give it a shot.
-[chuckles] Just shake it off.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.077
[Silvia laughs]

17:58.911 --> 17:59.995
[giggles]

18:13.967 --> 18:15.135
Wow.

18:15.219 --> 18:19.098
Yeah. Sometimes, the people need
just as much work as the animals do.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.017
Maybe I should be a psychotherapist.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.394
-[both chuckles]

-Hi.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.380
I just wanted to wish you good luck
in the competition.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.048
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:53.423 --> 18:58.053
I also wanted to apologize
for not being very welcoming earlier.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.849
I can be kind of awkward
when I meet new people,

19:01.932 --> 19:03.183
then I relax later.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.560
Sounds just like Debbie.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.062
[laughs] That's funny.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.440
'Cause Debbie's a horse, but I'm not.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.694
You know, I loved
your Rescue Ranch website,

19:13.777 --> 19:15.612
especially Gary the Goat.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.823
Think I could meet him in person sometime?

19:17.906 --> 19:20.909
-Sure. Gary would love to meet you.
-[giggles]

19:20.993 --> 19:22.244
I have to go.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.413
I just wanted to wish you good luck.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.831
Good luck.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.877
Hey, Brianna.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.213
Thank you. And good luck to you, too.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.932
-Beautiful, aren't they?
-Yeah. And they're so well-trained.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.476
I'm so excited for you.
You're gonna be a great trainer.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.062
Thank you.
And thanks for helping Trish out, too.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.065
Oh, of course.
Anything for the two of you.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.150
[laughs]

19:53.233 --> 19:54.902
Well, I've gotta go over there, so...

19:54.985 --> 19:57.112
-Oh, yeah.
-[laughs]

19:57.196 --> 19:59.031
-See ya.
-Yeah, you, too.

[chattering]

20:05.037 --> 20:09.333
-Oh, do you want these pom-poms?
-Sure, Ethan. Thanks. [giggles]

20:09.416 --> 20:11.793
Was that Silvia Jacobs
you were talking to over there?

20:12.753 --> 20:17.841
Um, yeah. She's, uh...
She's a trainer and a rodeo rider.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.220
[scoffs] I know who she is,
and she is good.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.139
She was answering my questions
about being a trainer.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.808
I was thinking about it
as a possible career.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.811
I love the thought of being a vet.
I just...

20:30.395 --> 20:31.688
I don't know what I wanna be.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.941
Really? That's wonderful.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.652
[scoffs] What?

20:37.319 --> 20:39.863
Skye, it's hard to make a career choice.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.491
And I'm glad you're looking
at all your options.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.701
I really wanted to be a trainer.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.372
You did?
I thought you always wanted to be a vet.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.166
That came later.
That was after I wanted to be a pilot.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.043
And after, I wanted to be a fireman.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.670
Really?

20:55.128 --> 20:59.633
Really. You don't have to make
big decisions like this at your age.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.760
There's lots of time to decide.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.930
In fact, you can do anything
you set your heart to.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.099
Thanks, Grandpa.
