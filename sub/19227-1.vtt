WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:05.469
- Ahh...
- (phone ringing)

00:07.573 --> 00:09.773
Diaz home. You got Tom.

00:09.809 --> 00:12.376
Harley? Let me get her.

00:12.411 --> 00:15.679
Harley! Harley!

00:15.715 --> 00:17.715
Daphne.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.683
Need you to find Harley.

00:19.719 --> 00:24.455
But I'm making toast. It's the
last piece of raisin bread.

00:24.490 --> 00:27.558
I had seven kids
so that when one was lost,

00:27.593 --> 00:29.493
there'd be six others to find them.

00:29.528 --> 00:30.694
Go.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.731
Just so this is still
here when I get back...

00:38.404 --> 00:40.771
Georgie, I need you
to find Harley pronto.

00:40.806 --> 00:42.539
I'm on my way to practice.

00:42.575 --> 00:46.510
Dad specifically said,
"Daphne, we need to find Harley,

00:46.545 --> 00:48.846
and Georgie's the best one to do it."

00:48.881 --> 00:51.381
Yeah, I could see that.

00:52.104 --> 00:53.270
One minute, please.

00:56.622 --> 00:58.838
Lewie, Beast, have you seen Harley?

00:58.863 --> 01:00.524
I'm trying to get out of the house.

01:00.559 --> 01:02.392
I have to go to prac...

01:02.428 --> 01:04.328
What are you doing?

01:04.363 --> 01:06.764
Frying bacon. It's not really
crisping up like we like.

01:06.799 --> 01:09.366
Package said two minutes
in the microwave.

01:09.401 --> 01:10.734
Didn't say how long for patio.

01:10.770 --> 01:13.604
In 30 seconds, we eat it either way.

01:13.639 --> 01:16.507
The phone's for Harley.
Can you guys help find her?

01:16.542 --> 01:19.810
It's a super important,
possibly dangerous mission.

01:19.845 --> 01:23.747
- Dangerous mission?
- We won't let you down.

01:25.818 --> 01:28.585
Look, a helmet!

01:28.621 --> 01:30.554
Let's go head-butt some stuff!

01:30.589 --> 01:32.422
Phone's for Harley!

01:32.458 --> 01:35.726
Uh. Oh, Rachel, need you to find Harley.
She has a call.

01:35.761 --> 01:37.728
From who, 1998?

01:37.763 --> 01:40.531
Who even uses a landline anymore?

01:40.566 --> 01:41.765
(sighs)

01:41.801 --> 01:45.502
Rachel, I'm busy with laundry.
Find Harley.

01:46.772 --> 01:48.539
Hmm.

01:50.442 --> 01:52.442
Hey, Ethan, phone's for Harley.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.545
I can't find her.
I've looked everywhere.

01:54.580 --> 01:55.779
Did you try her room?

01:55.815 --> 01:58.415
Let's not do this.
We both know I didn't.

02:00.519 --> 02:02.553
(knocks) Hey, Harls. Phone's for you.

02:02.588 --> 02:05.355
I'm kind of busy
with my self-tying balloon.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.424
(gas gushing)

02:08.693 --> 02:10.661
May I take a message for Harley?

02:10.696 --> 02:13.463
(gas gushing)

02:13.499 --> 02:16.567
I'm very sorry you had
to hold for so long.

02:16.602 --> 02:19.736
No, this is not a college dorm.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.406
Okay, you're calling about the invention

02:22.441 --> 02:23.774
she submitted to Cannon Ball Cove,

02:23.809 --> 02:25.409
and would like to...

02:25.444 --> 02:27.511
This is Harley.

02:27.546 --> 02:29.780
You're kidding! Really?

02:31.383 --> 02:32.783
Really?

02:32.818 --> 02:34.685
Thank you!

02:34.720 --> 02:37.387
We're going to a waterpark!

02:37.423 --> 02:40.457
(kids exclaiming)

02:40.492 --> 02:42.759
Doughnuts aren't the only thing
that gets them running.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.528
Good to know.

02:44.563 --> 02:48.365
- Yes!

03:39.418 --> 03:41.121
Our whole family is getting

03:41.146 --> 03:42.979
a free weekend at a waterpark?

03:43.004 --> 03:44.203
Is this an internet scam?

03:44.228 --> 03:46.390
Have we been hacked?
Tom, we've been hacked!

03:46.425 --> 03:47.557
We haven't been hacked.

03:47.593 --> 03:49.493
Are you sure?

03:49.528 --> 03:51.628
'Cause normally places
pay us to leave, not come.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.563
It's a thank you
because Cannon Ball Cove's

03:53.599 --> 03:55.499
trying out an invention I submitted,

03:55.534 --> 03:56.500
the Dry-Through.

03:56.535 --> 03:57.634
It's like a hand dryer,

03:57.670 --> 03:59.469
but it dries your whole body super fast.

03:59.505 --> 04:02.539
Big family is the mother of invention.

04:02.574 --> 04:05.475
With nine people, you can
never find a clean towel,

04:05.511 --> 04:08.478
so instead of trying to dry off
with a soggy bathmat...

04:08.514 --> 04:12.349
♪

04:12.384 --> 04:14.451
<i>Yeah, it roasted my ice cream,</i>

04:16.588 --> 04:18.721
<i>Ooh, strawberry!</i>

04:18.757 --> 04:21.725
They said if the Dry-Through
is a hit at Cannon Ball Cove,

04:21.760 --> 04:24.461
they're going to install it
in all of their parks!

04:24.496 --> 04:27.331
Free waterpark vacation every year!

04:27.366 --> 04:28.598
(cheering)

04:28.634 --> 04:30.634
Everybody, slow down.

04:30.669 --> 04:33.637
I hate to be the wet blanket
in the Dry-Through celebration,

04:33.672 --> 04:37.641
but there is no way this family is
spending a weekend at a waterpark.

04:37.676 --> 04:41.445
Who says no to a free
waterpark vacation?

04:41.480 --> 04:44.414
My parents. Not because they're mean.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.816
Because they've learned.

04:45.851 --> 04:49.353
A vacation with seven
kids is no vacation.

04:49.388 --> 04:51.655
We're really proud
of your achievement, Harley,

04:51.690 --> 04:54.358
but we've been burned too many times.

04:54.393 --> 04:56.360
All our family trips
come with the four C's...

04:56.395 --> 04:59.629
cost, chaos, complaining,
and casualties.

04:59.665 --> 05:01.498
And besides, the past few years

05:01.533 --> 05:03.333
we've finally found a vacation

05:03.369 --> 05:05.402
that's simple, efficient, and close.

05:05.437 --> 05:06.470
Pilgrim Land.

05:09.508 --> 05:10.774
- Pilgrim Land?!
- (all groaning)

05:10.809 --> 05:14.578
Pilgrim Land. How I hate thee.

05:14.613 --> 05:16.480
Thou totally sucketh.

05:17.516 --> 05:18.749
Just so you know,

05:18.784 --> 05:22.386
that place is starting to
make me hate Thanksgiving.

05:22.421 --> 05:23.587
Live with that!

05:25.524 --> 05:28.592
(scoffs) Come on, it's not that bad.

05:28.627 --> 05:30.761
Five days of showering
underneath a bucket,

05:30.796 --> 05:33.330
and no cell service? I can't.

05:33.365 --> 05:36.500
Yeah. Wheat-grinding class
is not entertainment.

05:36.535 --> 05:37.801
And shucking corn is not a sport,

05:37.836 --> 05:40.637
even if I did cut
my shucking time in half,

05:40.672 --> 05:42.539
not to brag or anything.

05:42.574 --> 05:45.642
I solemnly swear there will
be no chaos or complaining.

05:45.677 --> 05:49.446
Signed by Rachel Diaz, only valid
during waterpark vacations.

05:49.481 --> 05:50.814
All the kids will sign it.

05:50.849 --> 05:52.549
We'll make a deal.

05:52.584 --> 05:55.352
Take us to Cannon Ball Cove,
and if you regret it,

05:55.387 --> 05:57.354
you never have to take us
on vacation again.

05:57.389 --> 05:59.623
No vacations ever again?

05:59.658 --> 06:01.591
I got to admit, I would like to eat

06:01.627 --> 06:03.660
at a food court
that doesn't serve blubber.

06:03.695 --> 06:07.297
They're wavering! Time to seal the deal

06:07.332 --> 06:09.599
with a shameless tug
on the heartstrings.

06:12.738 --> 06:18.375
Mom, Dad, family is
about making memories.

06:18.410 --> 06:20.444
Memories are your family's story.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.315
Don't you want our family
to have a great story?

06:28.554 --> 06:32.722
(chanting) Waterpark!
Waterpark! Waterpark!

06:32.758 --> 06:36.359
Waterpark! Waterpark! Waterpark!

06:36.395 --> 06:38.462
Everybody belted in
and ready for lift-off?

06:38.497 --> 06:39.663
ALL: Yeah!

06:39.698 --> 06:41.631
Here we go!

06:41.667 --> 06:42.766
(cheering )

06:42.801 --> 06:45.735
Hello! I'm not even in the car.

06:45.771 --> 06:50.340
Oh! I thought that giant cooler
behind me was you.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.708
Should've known. It was too happy.

06:51.743 --> 06:54.811
You realize we're going
on vacation, not moving?

06:54.847 --> 06:58.415
Why do you think
I only have my shirt drawer?

07:02.421 --> 07:04.287
I'm hot!

07:04.323 --> 07:06.756
Can you strap me on the roof
with the luggage?

07:06.792 --> 07:08.525
Uh, what's that I hear?

07:08.560 --> 07:10.460
It can't be complaining,

07:10.496 --> 07:12.462
'cause you all signed a contract.

07:13.765 --> 07:15.732
This is genius, and the best part is,

07:15.767 --> 07:18.602
for once, we get to pick
what station to listen to.

07:18.637 --> 07:19.636

08:34.513 --> 08:35.679
Greetings, Harley!

08:35.714 --> 08:37.614
I'm Rachel. She's Harley.

08:37.649 --> 08:39.381
Hi!

08:39.418 --> 08:41.518
I'm Chester Torvalton, park manager,

08:41.553 --> 08:42.751
and it is my honor to welcome

08:42.788 --> 08:45.422
the Diaz family to Cannon Ball Cove!

08:45.457 --> 08:47.591
Or as we call it,
Hawaii in New Hampshire.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.593
Don't climb the palm trees.

08:49.628 --> 08:51.761
They're actually cell phone
towers in disguise.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.764
Why would you disguise them?
They're beautiful.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.367
And congratulations
on the Dry-Through, Harley!

08:57.402 --> 08:59.603
We're so excited, we're debuting
the Dry-Through this weekend

08:59.638 --> 09:02.439
in time for the Aqualympics on Sunday!

09:02.474 --> 09:03.673
Honored am so I!

09:03.709 --> 09:05.642
I mean, I am so honored.

09:05.677 --> 09:07.477
Sorry, I'm not thinking right.

09:07.512 --> 09:09.479
Too many pool noodles
to the head, I guess.

09:09.514 --> 09:11.348
Colorful and confusing.

09:11.383 --> 09:13.350
Well, listen, I'm sure you're
all anxious to unload.

09:13.385 --> 09:14.584
How about I show you to your room,

09:14.620 --> 09:15.752
and then you can all hit the park.

09:15.787 --> 09:17.320
That would be great.

09:17.356 --> 09:18.688
I know I speak for the family

09:18.724 --> 09:20.523
when I say we are looking forward

09:20.559 --> 09:22.692
to having some space!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.728
Here's your room!

09:27.366 --> 09:28.465
Sleep tight tonight.

09:28.726 --> 09:30.993
In this room? That's a guarantee.

09:34.935 --> 09:38.003
I'm sorry, but there
must be some mistake.

09:38.038 --> 09:41.073
I was told we had accommodations
for the whole family.

09:41.108 --> 09:43.976
Well, this room is for a whole family.

09:44.011 --> 09:45.764
A normal-sized family.

09:45.789 --> 09:47.946
Your family is normal plus five.

09:47.982 --> 09:50.115
Nice! You think some of us are normal.

09:50.150 --> 09:54.052
I would love to give you more space,
but the hotel is completely sold out.

09:54.288 --> 09:55.554
- (beeping)
- Oops!

09:55.589 --> 09:57.322
Time to get my steps in!

09:57.357 --> 10:00.258
Better get my Waiki-keester in gear.

10:01.462 --> 10:02.594
Is this a joke?

10:02.629 --> 10:05.163
Like, one of those hidden camera things?

10:05.199 --> 10:06.431
Is my mascara okay?

10:06.467 --> 10:08.300
I'm pretty sure the elevator was bigger.

10:08.335 --> 10:10.368
Me and Deathnee call the bed!

10:10.404 --> 10:13.138
BOTH: Bed battle!

10:13.173 --> 10:14.406
I called it!

10:14.441 --> 10:16.274
Good! Chaos and complaining,

10:16.310 --> 10:19.177
and we've added a bonus C, cramped.

10:19.213 --> 10:20.412
We should just pack up.

10:20.447 --> 10:22.247
I'll call Ezekiel at Pilgrim Land.

10:22.282 --> 10:24.282
Maybe he can fit us in.

10:24.318 --> 10:27.419
No! I did not just spend four hours

10:27.454 --> 10:30.422
in a nine-person fart box
to turn back now.

10:30.457 --> 10:33.225
We are going to make
some happy family memories

10:33.260 --> 10:35.494
no matter how miserable we are.

10:35.529 --> 10:38.296
We could leave, but you always say

10:38.332 --> 10:41.166
we don't spend enough time
together as a family.

10:41.201 --> 10:43.168
There's no avoiding it here.

10:43.203 --> 10:46.171
She's right. What do you think?

10:46.206 --> 10:50.208
I think there's no way I want to
pack that car twice in one day.

10:50.244 --> 10:51.443
Let's get our swimsuits!

10:51.478 --> 10:52.611
All right, a few people wait in the hall

10:52.646 --> 10:54.346
so we can open these suitcases.

10:54.381 --> 10:56.581
Not complaining is very stressful.

10:56.617 --> 10:58.450
I've never done it before!

10:58.485 --> 11:01.286
I don't even know who I am right now.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.488
Nine people, three trips...

11:03.524 --> 11:05.490
Yeah, it seems about
the right amount of stuff

11:05.526 --> 11:07.392
to bring to a waterpark for a day.

11:07.427 --> 11:10.562
Should've had your father sign
that no-complaining contract.

11:10.597 --> 11:13.231
H2-whoas all around.

11:13.267 --> 11:16.401
Everybody, let's put on sunscreen.

11:16.436 --> 11:19.171
I'm pretty sure we're missing Daphne,

11:19.206 --> 11:21.139
but if you agree, I'm willing to wait

11:21.175 --> 11:23.141
until we hit a few rides to bring it up.

11:23.177 --> 11:24.342
She's not missing.

11:30.317 --> 11:32.417
Wow, Harles!

11:35.355 --> 11:38.523
Mom Tracker 2.0 is now
Daphne Tracker on the Go.

11:38.559 --> 11:39.591
Mom! Mom! Dad! Dad!

11:39.626 --> 11:42.194
I just saw a lollypop so big

11:42.229 --> 11:44.362
you can sprain your tongue on it!

11:44.398 --> 11:47.199
It's a great deal. Only 20 bucks.

11:47.234 --> 11:49.334
At Pilgrim Land, no one begs for treats.

11:49.369 --> 11:52.504
It's not a treat when you have to
catch it and kill it yourself.

11:52.539 --> 11:54.472
I'm sorry, do I hear complaining?

11:54.508 --> 11:58.343
It can't be. Otherwise we
never go on vacation again!

11:58.378 --> 12:01.246
Complaining? Who's complaining?

12:01.281 --> 12:04.149
We're happy, happy, happy to be here!

12:04.184 --> 12:06.351
Yeah, whoo! Diggity doo!

12:06.386 --> 12:07.352
Diggity doo?

12:07.387 --> 12:08.520
That's a thing.

12:08.555 --> 12:10.155
So, I was thinking,

12:10.190 --> 12:11.423
first we'll all try the Dry-Through,

12:11.458 --> 12:13.158
then we'll go on the other rides...

12:13.193 --> 12:16.361
Last one to the Doom Funnel's
a diggity doo!

12:16.396 --> 12:19.130
(cheering)

12:25.339 --> 12:28.406
Good thought. Get wet,
then try the Dry-Through.

12:28.442 --> 12:31.409
My idea of vacation isn't
playing waterpark sherpa

12:31.445 --> 12:33.378
to seven lazy kids.

12:33.413 --> 12:36.448
The only thing lazy
is the river on that part.

12:36.483 --> 12:38.250
Time for you two
to float the stress away.

12:38.285 --> 12:40.471
Rachel and I will grab
the stuff and find seats.

12:40.524 --> 12:41.868
Wait, wait, what?

12:41.893 --> 12:43.993
- Are you sure you can handle all this?
- No, we definitely cannot.

12:44.018 --> 12:46.078
Don't waste any more time
talking about this.

12:46.103 --> 12:48.493
Go! Have fun.

12:48.528 --> 12:50.161
Okay! Look at this!

12:50.197 --> 12:51.296
Ooh, okay.

12:51.331 --> 12:52.464
Ooh, look at this place.

12:52.499 --> 12:54.232
This is gonna be fun!

12:54.268 --> 12:56.301
Fun? I haven't had
one post-worthy moment

12:56.336 --> 12:57.535
since we left the house.

12:57.571 --> 12:59.471
What's the point of going on vacation

12:59.506 --> 13:01.373
if people can't see you on vacation?

13:01.408 --> 13:04.209
Unless you want everyone
to think you lost <i> Storage Wars,</i>

13:04.244 --> 13:07.145
I suggest we move this into the park.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.347
(sighs)

13:10.584 --> 13:13.184
It's so awesome!

13:13.220 --> 13:14.552
What do you mean we can't ride it?

13:14.588 --> 13:16.388
Mm, sorry, not big enough.

13:16.423 --> 13:18.189
Missed it by a tentacle.

13:18.225 --> 13:20.525
I would like you
to call your supervisor.

13:20.560 --> 13:24.129
I am the supervisor,
and you already called for me.

13:24.164 --> 13:26.464
- (chatter, laughter)
- Oh, good, you're here!

13:26.500 --> 13:28.600
Can you guys vouch that
we're bigger than we look?

13:28.635 --> 13:30.368
They have rules for a reason.

13:30.404 --> 13:32.470
You're too small to ride.

13:32.506 --> 13:34.205
But you're not too small

13:34.241 --> 13:36.341
to take a picture of me
as I come down this bad boy.

13:36.376 --> 13:39.144
We'll wave from the top.

13:39.179 --> 13:42.480
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, uhh!

13:42.516 --> 13:44.416
I think I just stepped on a bee.

13:44.451 --> 13:47.352
A bee! Ooh. Looks like
someone got a Maui owie.

13:47.387 --> 13:50.188
I'm sorry, but you cannot ride
with a wound on your foot.

13:50.223 --> 13:54.292
A wound? I stepped on a bee,
not a chainsaw. I'm fine.

13:54.328 --> 13:57.429
Ah ah ah, rule number three:
no open wounds.

13:57.464 --> 14:01.499
I'm sorry, but you'll have to go to
First Aid and get that bandaged.

14:01.535 --> 14:03.435
They have rules for a reason.

14:03.470 --> 14:06.137
Do you want me to take
a picture of you at First Aid,

14:06.173 --> 14:07.238
or am I too small?

14:09.509 --> 14:12.344
Last gal standing. Soon to be sliding!

14:12.379 --> 14:14.212
Look out, Doom Funnel!

14:14.247 --> 14:15.447
Yes! Okay.

14:18.385 --> 14:21.419
I can't do this.
I'm not like you, Harley.

14:21.455 --> 14:23.388
I'm not a workhorse.

14:23.423 --> 14:26.291
I'm one of those little dogs
that wears a tutu

14:26.326 --> 14:28.426
and rides around
in Paris Hilton's purse.

14:28.462 --> 14:30.161
We are almost there.

14:30.197 --> 14:33.231
We just need to find nine
chaise lounges and...

14:33.266 --> 14:35.567
Hey! There's my Dry-Through!

14:39.406 --> 14:42.173
Weird. No one's using it.

14:42.209 --> 14:43.341
Yeah, real surprise.

14:43.377 --> 14:44.609
On a hot day in a waterpark,

14:44.644 --> 14:48.179
a thing called "Dry"
isn't a big attraction.

14:48.215 --> 14:50.348
Great. There's nowhere to sit.

14:50.384 --> 14:52.584
Every lounge can't possibly be taken.

14:56.289 --> 14:58.623
Uh, excuse me, young ladies,

14:58.658 --> 15:01.259
you may not understand
waterpark etiquette.

15:01.294 --> 15:03.361
A towel on a chaise means it is saved.

15:03.397 --> 15:05.096
Sorry, you're out of luck.

15:05.132 --> 15:07.232
- (beeping)
- Oh, hey!

15:07.267 --> 15:09.167
I've reached my exercise goal!

15:09.202 --> 15:12.337
Ope, nope. "Naked toddler
in the gift shop."

15:12.372 --> 15:14.339
Gotta run.

15:14.374 --> 15:16.307
Maybe you were right.

15:16.343 --> 15:18.376
Maybe this was a bad idea.

15:18.412 --> 15:20.211
At least at Pilgrim Land

15:20.247 --> 15:22.180
everyone gets a hay bale to sit on.

15:22.215 --> 15:24.182
MAN: I've had it with you kids!

15:24.217 --> 15:26.251
Whoever replaced
the mayo with sunscreen,

15:26.286 --> 15:28.119
this is your fault; we're out of here.

15:28.155 --> 15:30.455
I don't care if I've already
paid for this cabana.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.364
(both sighing pleasurably)

15:39.399 --> 15:42.333
It's not the cabana's fault
those kids were brats!

15:42.369 --> 15:44.202
Why should it go to waste?

15:44.237 --> 15:47.539
I feel bad for the poor losers
out there in public lounges.

15:47.574 --> 15:50.608
Well, Cabana Seven,
can I get you anything else?

15:50.644 --> 15:53.445
Wait, this is part of the cabana?

15:53.480 --> 15:55.146
Yes. With cabana rental,

15:55.182 --> 15:56.614
all services are yours for the day.

15:56.650 --> 16:00.285
Get your smile ready! It's post time.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.187
Can you hold that right around here?

16:07.462 --> 16:09.362
More sparkling pear soda?

16:09.398 --> 16:11.631
Keep it flowing, Malcolm.

16:11.667 --> 16:15.468
This is the life. We're like
Kim and Kanye on vacation.

16:15.504 --> 16:17.537
Let me guess. You're Kim, I'm Kanye.

16:17.573 --> 16:19.573
We can both be Kim.

16:19.608 --> 16:22.475
Wow! The only Kardashian

16:22.511 --> 16:25.312
she ever let me be before was Rob.

16:25.347 --> 16:28.315
Am I getting teary?
I feel like I'm getting teary.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.216
This is amazing.

16:30.252 --> 16:33.253
I had no idea cheese came from
so many different animals.

16:33.288 --> 16:35.622
Yeah. Before today,
I thought "assorted cheese"

16:35.657 --> 16:38.224
meant stick, string, or spray.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.594
(chatter, laughter)

16:43.465 --> 16:45.398
I'm sure people will use it later.

16:45.434 --> 16:47.400
It's a really cool invention.

16:48.604 --> 16:51.571
Okay, now I'm definitely getting teary.

16:51.607 --> 16:54.641
Do you have to poop?
'Cause you look weird.

16:54.676 --> 16:56.242
And I'm back.

16:56.278 --> 16:57.677

Hey! We haven't seen Malcolm
in a little while.

17:14.262 --> 17:16.496
Can you be a sweetheart and
get us a few more of these?

17:16.531 --> 17:18.498
Also, get yourself one of these robes.

17:18.532 --> 17:20.500
I can't believe they make
you wear that shirt.

17:20.535 --> 17:23.502
I'm not your waiter,
and this is my shirt.

17:23.538 --> 17:25.571
Oh, sorry, but don't feel bad.

17:25.607 --> 17:27.272
She insults my outfit every day.

17:27.309 --> 17:28.474
It's kind of my thing.

17:28.510 --> 17:31.311
Ah, well, my thing is
relaxing with my family

17:31.346 --> 17:34.280
in the cabana next door, so
could you keep the noise down?

17:34.316 --> 17:36.683
Of course. We didn't
realize you could hear us.

17:36.718 --> 17:40.420
Yes, who would think sound carries
through a tent flap, hmm? Ahem.

17:43.392 --> 17:45.358
What's Daphne up to?

She's with Ethan, cheering
him on at the ring toss.

17:47.629 --> 17:50.397
Aw, precious.

17:50.432 --> 17:52.599
You're wasting your cash, you loser!

17:52.634 --> 17:54.534
I'm not giving you lollypop money.

17:54.569 --> 17:55.702
I need to spend it on the games.

17:55.737 --> 17:57.504
I'm injured and can't swim.

17:57.539 --> 17:59.606
Yeah, well, next time
when someone's trying

17:59.641 --> 18:01.508
to remove a stinger from your foot,

18:01.543 --> 18:03.610
try not to kick and squeal
like a little baby.

18:03.645 --> 18:07.547
Okay. First off, that needle was huge,

18:07.582 --> 18:10.617
and you're not gonna shame me
into giving you money.

18:14.489 --> 18:17.357
She's cute. Bet she'll want
to hear about your foot.

18:17.392 --> 18:19.292
- No, Daphne!
- Hey, girl!

18:19.327 --> 18:21.394
You want to hear a funny story
about my brother's foot?

18:21.430 --> 18:23.630
And how I injured it from fighting
off an escaped mountain lion?

18:23.665 --> 18:26.433
Oh, poor little sis had to see it all.

Go buy something to forget.

We got a winner!

18:38.680 --> 18:41.214
Hey, thanks.

18:41.249 --> 18:43.316
Pretty good aim for a guy
who's recently been mauled.

18:43.351 --> 18:44.551
Here, you can have it.

18:44.586 --> 18:47.520
Actually, that purple
unicorn is really cute.

18:47.556 --> 18:49.222
Think you can win it?

18:49.257 --> 18:51.391
I put a mountain lion
into a full Nelson,

18:51.426 --> 18:53.359
then tied its tail into a knot.

18:54.463 --> 18:55.628
I-I went too far.

18:55.664 --> 18:58.631
- Little bit.
- Yeah, I felt it.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.300
One unicorn, coming up!

19:03.605 --> 19:05.472
Whoo! Whoa, some line.

19:05.507 --> 19:08.274
Quads are on fire.
Good thing I'm an athlete.

19:10.412 --> 19:13.513
Whoa, that tunnel is much narrower
than it looks from below.

19:13.548 --> 19:15.615
Does anyone just... bloop!...
get stuck in there?

19:15.650 --> 19:19.452
Because with this hair it'll be
like whoo! Like a cork, you know?

hear where we landed.

polish is worth the extra cost?

Totally! Just grabbing a water first,

20:48.410 --> 20:49.475
but, um, I'm stoked.

20:49.511 --> 20:50.743
Can't spell "funnel"

20:50.779 --> 20:52.579
without "fun"... and "ill."

You're scared. You know
what I do when I'm scared?

20:55.603 --> 20:56.547
What?

20:56.571 --> 20:59.396
Buy a giant lollypop
to share with my sister

20:59.421 --> 21:01.321
and her doll who's like a person.

21:01.356 --> 21:04.224
Nice try, but I'm not here
for a three-person lollypop.

21:04.259 --> 21:05.358
I'm here to do the slide.

21:05.393 --> 21:08.528
(deep breaths)

21:08.563 --> 21:10.396
Hmm.

21:10.432 --> 21:13.533
Eh. We were not gonna share
with her, anyway.

21:16.504 --> 21:19.472
Seven bears, zero unicorns.

21:19.507 --> 21:20.573

A giant, sort-of creepy
pink bear for the road?

21:28.283 --> 21:31.551
No, thanks. But we
could meet up tomorrow

21:31.586 --> 21:33.319
and try this again.

21:33.355 --> 21:35.722
Unless another mountain lion escapes.

21:35.757 --> 21:38.491
No, no. They closed
the hole in that fence.

21:38.526 --> 21:40.493
It should be fine.

21:41.630 --> 21:42.662
Yes!

Okay, I'm really going this time.

Okay.

21:48.436 --> 21:49.736
Okay. Okay.

Ten, nine...

21:54.442 --> 21:55.675
Wait, what's the rush?

21:55.710 --> 22:01.381
Okay. A hundred, 99, 98...

22:06.688 --> 22:08.488
Yeah, the Doom Funnel.

Well, look at you two scallywags.

all that fun in one place.

30:54.423 --> 30:56.323
the great Dry-Through invention
for your park?

30:56.358 --> 30:58.258
Oh, you mean the one
that already got you

30:58.293 --> 31:00.026
free room and free entry into the park,

31:00.062 --> 31:01.328
and sadly no one is using?

31:02.965 --> 31:04.331
There, there.

31:04.366 --> 31:06.933
A waterpark is no place for long faces.

31:06.969 --> 31:08.268
Here.

31:08.303 --> 31:10.270
Here's a token for the arcade.

31:10.305 --> 31:12.205
You know what'll turn your day around?

31:12.241 --> 31:13.340
Winning a backscratcher!

31:16.311 --> 31:18.178
ETHAN: <i>One unicorn coming up!</i>

31:18.213 --> 31:19.346
Okay, here we go. I got it.

31:22.251 --> 31:24.351
- Winner!
- Yes! 94th time's the charm!

31:24.386 --> 31:25.352
Oh, thanks.

31:25.387 --> 31:28.221
Oh, hello!

31:28.257 --> 31:30.223
Here. Come on.

31:31.994 --> 31:34.961
Oh, man. See that guy coming this way?

31:34.997 --> 31:37.230
He was in the cabana
next to us yesterday.

31:37.266 --> 31:39.299
Total jerk!

31:39.334 --> 31:42.002
That's my dad.

31:42.037 --> 31:44.070
I'm not saying you have
to forgive our bill,

31:44.106 --> 31:46.273
but I may or may not have seen a rat

31:46.308 --> 31:48.208
floating in the kiddie pool,

31:48.243 --> 31:50.343
and I have many, many followers

31:50.379 --> 31:52.979
who would be very upset to hear this.

31:53.015 --> 31:55.248
Post away. Last year, we had a barracuda

31:55.284 --> 31:58.151
in the Lazy River
and attendance barely dipped.

31:58.187 --> 32:00.287
Not sure how it got there.

32:00.322 --> 32:04.057
I suspect my ex-wife who just
came back from the Caribbean.

32:04.092 --> 32:07.060
Point is, you can't
keep people from fun.

32:07.095 --> 32:08.128
Speaking of fun...

32:10.065 --> 32:12.232
(scoffs)

32:19.174 --> 32:21.208
Subject spotted.

32:23.345 --> 32:25.145
Copy that.

32:27.015 --> 32:29.916
Excuse me, would you mind
looking for an orange bracelet?

32:29.952 --> 32:31.318
I know I left it on my way...

32:31.353 --> 32:33.153
On your way down,
can you keep an eye out

32:33.188 --> 32:36.923
for an orange bracelet? I... I...

32:36.959 --> 32:38.191
(tweets)

32:39.428 --> 32:41.394
(sighs) You can do this, Georgie.

32:41.430 --> 32:44.064
Face your fears, Georgie.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.033
It's just a slide, right?

32:48.303 --> 32:50.971
I can't! I can't do it! Aah!

32:51.006 --> 32:56.176
(screaming)

32:56.211 --> 32:59.346
Oh, have you ever seen
our kids so happy?

32:59.381 --> 33:01.047
Never.

33:01.083 --> 33:02.148
Mm!

33:02.184 --> 33:03.316
How cute!

33:03.352 --> 33:06.086
Daphne's chatting with Mr. Torvalton.

33:06.121 --> 33:08.888
Oh! She really is getting
to be so grown up.

33:08.924 --> 33:11.925
Daphne be so sad!

33:13.195 --> 33:14.227
Aw, come on.

33:14.263 --> 33:16.329
I hate to see a little girl cry.

33:16.365 --> 33:18.932
Me hate it, too.

33:18.967 --> 33:20.967
Well, your siblings seem like nice kids.

33:21.003 --> 33:23.303
This wasn't intentional, I suppose.

33:23.338 --> 33:25.071
It was an honest mistake.

33:25.107 --> 33:28.375
Yes. They do bad boo-boo with bill.

33:28.410 --> 33:32.212
Well, your sister did make
that invention we installed.

33:32.247 --> 33:34.180
It's not her fault no one's using it.

33:34.216 --> 33:37.117
(sighs) We're having
a really good season,

33:37.152 --> 33:40.120
and our markup on those cabana
items is really outrageous.

33:40.155 --> 33:41.988
Don't quote me on that.

33:42.024 --> 33:45.258
Okay, just this once,

33:45.294 --> 33:49.029
I'm going to do something I never do.

33:49.064 --> 33:51.231
I'm going to forgive your bill!

33:53.235 --> 33:54.968
Hit it, Beast!

33:58.240 --> 34:01.007
(shouting)

34:02.110 --> 34:04.911
Yeah! Welcome to our Doom Funnel!

34:04.946 --> 34:07.113
Who's too small now?!

34:08.949 --> 34:11.083
Just wanted to say thanks
for forgiving our bill.

34:11.119 --> 34:13.353
So cool of you. Hashtag Chester rocks.

34:13.388 --> 34:16.188
Hashtag the deal is off.

34:16.224 --> 34:18.291
With the additional charges
your parents racked up,

34:18.327 --> 34:21.928
your bill is now $922.17.

34:21.963 --> 34:23.963
It'll be on your tab at checkout.

34:23.998 --> 34:25.031
I'm soaked!

34:25.067 --> 34:28.268
- This was my Aqualympics outfit!
- (beeping)

34:28.303 --> 34:31.304
Well, at least my Wrist Walker's
still working.

34:31.340 --> 34:34.908
I wonder if I get extra points
for stomping angrily!

34:36.210 --> 34:38.311
Maybe consider a nice stomp
through the Dry-Through!

34:38.347 --> 34:40.045
There's no line!

34:46.696 --> 34:49.530
That's it! We're out of options.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.376
We'll never pay this cabana bill.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.467
- Hey!
- Hi.

34:53.503 --> 34:54.960
We have to tell Mom and Dad the truth.

34:54.985 --> 34:57.538
We do. We both know I mean you.

34:57.574 --> 34:58.929
Yeah, got that.

34:58.954 --> 35:01.352
Ethan, this is my dad, Simon Pillman,

35:01.377 --> 35:04.044
but you already know him, right?

35:04.080 --> 35:08.182
No! I was thinking
of someone else, different guy.

35:08.217 --> 35:10.887
You were in the cabana
next to ours yesterday.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.987
We have quieter neighbors today...

35:13.022 --> 35:15.189
a flock of wild parrots
having a drum circle.

35:15.224 --> 35:17.291
Hannah, I came to tell
you lunch is ready.

35:17.327 --> 35:18.959
Be right there.

35:20.229 --> 35:23.370
Great. Your dad hates me.

35:23.433 --> 35:26.501
Don't feel special.
My dad hates most people.

35:26.536 --> 35:29.455
Really? Awesome!

35:29.480 --> 35:31.506
I've never been so happy
I'm not special!

35:31.541 --> 35:33.341
Not to him...

35:34.866 --> 35:36.413
We can still stay in touch.

35:36.438 --> 35:39.249
Dad doesn't need to know
everyone that I text.

35:39.675 --> 35:41.975
Nice! Like forbidden love.

35:42.516 --> 35:45.675
This is a waterpark, not <i> Twilight.</i>

35:45.700 --> 35:47.734
You are ridiculously lame.

35:50.460 --> 35:54.375
I'm lame? Only one of us
is holding a purple unicorn.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.367
(giggles)

35:57.767 --> 35:59.334
(screaming)

36:00.637 --> 36:03.504
Got my bracelet!

36:03.540 --> 36:07.117
Oh, no. That can happen?

36:10.886 --> 36:13.720
Will you hold this for me? Thanks!

36:16.586 --> 36:18.753
(screaming)

36:21.090 --> 36:23.090
Mom! Dad!

36:25.028 --> 36:27.895
I'm about to tell you something
you're not going to like.

36:27.931 --> 36:30.392
Could you cut to the chase? There's
a rowdy Scout troop on our tails.

36:30.417 --> 36:34.669
Let me just start off by saying I
love you both very much and...

36:37.740 --> 36:40.107
HARLEY: <i>Family Aqualympics today?</i>

36:40.143 --> 36:44.679
<i>Winner gets $1,000 in Splash Bucks?</i>

36:44.714 --> 36:46.714
We're doing the Aqualympics!

36:46.749 --> 36:49.026
You're kidding. The Diaz family

36:49.051 --> 36:51.018
wants to compete in the Aqualympics?

36:51.054 --> 36:53.688
Yes. We're going to win first place,

36:53.723 --> 36:55.656
$1,000 in Splash Bucks!

36:55.692 --> 36:57.925
Well, not to drench your enthusiasm,

36:57.961 --> 37:00.828
much like you drenched
my game-day suit, but ha!

37:00.863 --> 37:02.830
The returning champs are competing.

37:02.865 --> 37:04.632
They've won five years in a row.

37:04.667 --> 37:05.666
They're unbeatable.

37:05.702 --> 37:08.002
The Pillmans.

37:08.037 --> 37:10.972
♪

37:16.946 --> 37:19.647
You know when you're eating
popcorn at the movies,

37:19.682 --> 37:22.717
all happy, and then a kernel
gets stuck in your tooth?

37:22.752 --> 37:25.786
The Pillmans are my kernel!

37:25.822 --> 37:28.856
The Pillmans are about
to get a serious flossing.

37:28.891 --> 37:31.092
Okay, it's going to be a challenge,

37:31.127 --> 37:33.728
but Team Diaz has what it takes.

37:33.763 --> 37:37.732
One, two, three, four.

37:39.135 --> 37:42.069
We're going up against them?

37:42.105 --> 37:43.971
Thirty-nine, 40.

37:44.007 --> 37:46.641
Don't worry. We can do it.

37:46.676 --> 37:47.708
Yeah, totally.

37:47.744 --> 37:49.043
Second place, here we come.

37:49.078 --> 37:51.712
(sighs)

37:51.748 --> 37:54.949
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

37:58.087 --> 38:00.755
Guys, stop staring!

38:00.790 --> 38:02.590
You're letting them psych you out.

38:02.625 --> 38:03.624
Because they're bigger.

38:03.660 --> 38:04.925
- And faster.
- And stronger.

38:04.961 --> 38:06.961
Is that a family or a machine?

38:06.996 --> 38:10.965
Just FYI, I have a prior relationship
with one of the Pillmans,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.001
so I may not be able to compete
with my whole heart.

38:14.037 --> 38:16.604
If you throw this, I will chase you down

38:16.639 --> 38:18.773
and beat you with your whole heart.

38:18.808 --> 38:21.709
And with that bum foot,
you know I'll catch you.

38:21.744 --> 38:23.811
I do. Never mind.

38:23.846 --> 38:26.814
If anyone can take down
the Pillman dynasty, it's us!

38:26.849 --> 38:28.949
We have nine people
with all different skills,

38:28.985 --> 38:31.952
and we've been training
for this our whole lives!

38:31.988 --> 38:34.789
Water jousting. Beast and Lewie.

38:34.824 --> 38:36.090
That's your specialty.

38:36.125 --> 38:38.959
(all shouting)

38:40.763 --> 38:41.962
Inner tube ring toss.

38:41.998 --> 38:43.698
That's you, lover boy.

38:43.733 --> 38:44.999
You're going to be
tossing them on Daphne,

38:45.034 --> 38:47.668
'cause she's always
in the middle of everything.

38:47.704 --> 38:50.004
Next up, we have roller ball derby.

38:50.039 --> 38:51.906
That's me and Rachel.

38:51.941 --> 38:53.808
Yeah, you didn't see this before.

39:02.018 --> 39:04.885
<i>Stiff-arming girls

39:04.921 --> 39:07.588
<i>was maybe not our finest moment.</i>

39:12.995 --> 39:17.064
Mom, Dad, you're going to be
a part of the family tug-of-war.

39:17.100 --> 39:18.833
We can handle that.

39:18.868 --> 39:21.736
Totally! We pull seven kids
out of bed every school day.

39:21.771 --> 39:24.939
And, last but not least,
the Doom Funnel waterslide race.

39:24.974 --> 39:26.907
Who's doing that?

39:26.943 --> 39:28.075
My lucky bracelet!

39:28.111 --> 39:31.679
I had to do that awful slide nine times.

39:31.714 --> 39:33.981
Thank goodness I'll never
have to do it again.

39:34.016 --> 39:36.751
(sympathetic chuckles)

39:36.786 --> 39:38.085

42:29.158 --> 42:31.759
What happened? What just happ... What?

42:31.794 --> 42:34.094
Just short of the finish line!

42:34.130 --> 42:37.798
That's a tough loss
to swallow for the Diaz family.

42:37.833 --> 42:40.801
You cheated! We would've won,
but you cheated!

42:40.836 --> 42:42.770
That's what losers always say!

42:42.805 --> 42:44.738
(scoffs)

42:44.774 --> 42:46.840
A solid performance by the Diaz clan,

42:46.876 --> 42:48.142
and Blackbeard's coin dive

42:48.177 --> 42:50.778
has bumped them up to second place!

42:50.813 --> 42:53.814
(cheering)

42:53.849 --> 42:56.717
And now our top two families
move into the final event,

42:56.752 --> 42:57.952
the tug of war!

42:57.987 --> 43:01.789
It's the Diazes versus the Pillmans.

43:01.824 --> 43:03.657
- Arm strength!
- Now, get ready, folks.

43:03.693 --> 43:05.993
This is a whole-family event
worth ten points.

43:06.028 --> 43:07.628
We can still win this!

43:07.663 --> 43:09.930
Nine of us against five of them!

43:09.966 --> 43:12.967
Finally! Being bigger
than a normal family

43:13.002 --> 43:14.768
will work to our advantage!

43:14.804 --> 43:15.869
Yeah, not really.

43:15.905 --> 43:17.972
We've beaten big families before,

43:18.007 --> 43:19.707
and, frankly, your three little ones

43:19.742 --> 43:20.941
barely add up to one person.

43:20.977 --> 43:22.643
No, he didn't!

43:22.678 --> 43:24.912
We missed our Doom Funnel
height by one tentacle!

43:24.947 --> 43:28.749
Mr. Cheater Family's right.

43:28.784 --> 43:32.119
Strength-wise, there's
no way we can win.

43:32.154 --> 43:34.922
Should've made an invention
that could pull a rope

43:34.957 --> 43:38.726
instead of that dumb Dry-Through
nobody wants to use.

43:38.761 --> 43:40.961
Hang on.

43:40.997 --> 43:44.999
Oh, wait. Little detour.
Follow me, quick!

The Dry-Through? Is that that
weird green thing by the cabanas?

44:17.867 --> 44:20.701
I thought that was just bad art!

Okay, settle down, people.

Yeah, not quite a thousand.

Long story.

You're right, it's awesome.

Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm not.
