WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.180
Oh, Phil, honey,
you're still up.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.848
Okay.
How does this sound?

00:06.924 --> 00:08.892
"Mitchell,
I love you very much.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.971
I not only love you, but I
admire you, and someday"-

00:12.054 --> 00:13.852
Are you firing him
or proposing to him?

00:13.931 --> 00:16.434
Honey, this was supposed to be
a part-time job.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.190
He was gonna be done
in the summer anyway.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.688
Just ... be direct.
I should have warned him.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.149
How do you tell someone they have
a reputation for being lazy?

00:23.273 --> 00:25.696
Mitchell, lazy?
Yeah, yeah.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.746
He handed in a couple of contracts late,
but I didn't want to say anything ...

00:28.820 --> 00:30.413
because he's practically
doing this for free.

00:30.489 --> 00:33.618
I can't do this! This isn't the face of
a cold-blooded hatchet man.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.244
Hmm.
Will you do it?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.338
Hey.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.166
Oh. I'm sorry.
Did we wake you up?

00:41.250 --> 00:43.969
No, I was up.
Worried about tomorrow.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.138
My art teacher
acts like I don't exist.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.558
But I've one last chance to impress him
at our year-end an fair.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.512
A few students are doing
living versions of famous paintings.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.562
I've chosen this one,
and I'm using my own family.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.140
Brilliant, right?

00:56.223 --> 00:59.067
When I told him, he said,
"That's nice, Alice."

00:59.142 --> 01:00.644
It's been a year.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.570
Alice? Really?

01:02.646 --> 01:04.068
Honey, do you think
you're nervous ...

01:04.147 --> 01:05.615
because you've got
a little crush on Mr. Jarvis?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.575
No. Are you sure? Because
I've seen the way you-

01:07.651 --> 01:09.824
Sounds like you're the one
with the crush.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.031
I've just never had a teacher
not like me before.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.661
Well, Miss Davis.
Mmm.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.162
Please. She's a gym teacher.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.336
She's to teaching
what Dr. Seuss is to medicine.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.505
And to think
she didn't like you.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.254
You?
What's your problem?

01:22.332 --> 01:24.755
Nothing. I'm just
excited for tomorrow.

01:24.835 --> 01:28.385
I'm getting a medal at school
because I put out a fire.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.182
Maybe that's what I should be
when I grow up-

01:31.258 --> 01:33.386
a professional medal-getter.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.773
- Luke, what happened?
- I don't know.

01:38.849 --> 01:42.353
I was just walking by
and I smelled flames.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.733
I was there.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.031
I don't like this.
We're not supposed to be in here.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.483
Just keep a lookout.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.534
We're 10 seconds away
from creating Luketonium.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.330
- Oh, crap!
- Look what you did!

01:55.449 --> 01:57.952
- Luke, what happened?
- I don't know.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.879
I was just walking by
and I smelled flames.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.219
Okay, guys. You're gonna be dragging tomorrow
if you don't go to bed right now. Let's go.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.262
Fine. Come on, Alice.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.840
I'll be up
in a minute.

02:14.551 --> 02:19.352
Mitchell, I can't tell you
how hard- how hard this-

02:19.431 --> 02:22.275
No, that's not personal enough.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.983
Okay, okay.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.819
I can't tell you how hurt
and angry this makes me,

02:31.902 --> 02:33.654
but you've been late
too many times.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.239
I'll need your keys.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.915
Daddy, no.
I'm so sorry.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.789
Honey, I didn't hear you come downstairs.
You couldn't sleep either?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.586
Uh, yeah.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.041
No, there's just, like,
a lot on my mind-

02:45.123 --> 02:48.502
with graduation
and what to wear-

02:48.585 --> 02:50.087
How does this look?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.423
Wait a second.
You're carrying your shoes.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.180
How am I supposed to judge
the whole outfit? Put 'em on.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.761
Oh.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.514
# Hey, hey #

03:00.597 --> 03:02.599
# Hey, hey #

03:02.683 --> 03:04.685
# Hey, hey #

03:04.768 --> 03:06.691
# Hey, hey #

03:06.770 --> 03:07.942
# Hey ##

03:10.315 --> 03:13.319
So make sure you give this menu
here a good, thorough reading.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.616
Soup.
You didn't even look at it.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.913
Soup. Check out what's below
the soup- Sandwiches.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.870
Have you check out
what is below this outfit?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.796
This doesn't come
from sandwiches.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.623
Look.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.927
"The Jay Pritchett"?
I don't understand.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.379
They named you after a sandwich?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.430
No, they named a sandwich
after me.

03:34.506 --> 03:38.682
Turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, red
peppers, anchovies on wheat?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.387
Most people stop
after salty bacon,

03:40.470 --> 03:42.063
but I double down
with anchovies.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.392
Were you making a sandwich
or attracting deer?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.397
Is this bum
bothering you, miss?

03:46.476 --> 03:49.104
I should get a picture of this.
An actual waitress sighting in this dump.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.908
I took a chance and put in
an order for your sandwich,

03:52.983 --> 03:55.782
although most people
like their Jay Pritchetts to go.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.951
What's happening?
Gloria, it's Maxine.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.532
So you're married to Jay.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.413
Where'd you tie up
your Seeing Eye dog?

04:02.492 --> 04:04.745
No, no, I'm not, um-

04:04.828 --> 04:07.377
Okay, I get it. I get it.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.966
Here's that number for that neck
doctor I want you to see. Thanks.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.543
What's wrong
with your neck?

04:11.626 --> 04:13.799
For 30 years, I've been
hearing it's a handball injury,

04:13.879 --> 04:16.382
but it always seems
to get worse with stress.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.137
Maybe it's that audit
he's got comin' up.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.762
- Audit?
- Nothing.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.562
Oh, isn't that cute?
He doesn't want you to worry.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.775
Here's your sandwich.
Now you should worry.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.693
Look at it.
My prettiest child.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.485
Why didn't you tell me about your neck?
it's fine. Take a bite.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.279
Your company's getting audited?
Nothing!

04:34.357 --> 04:37.281
Three bad days, then it's over. Come on!
I'm anxious to hear what you think.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.783
Uh-huh?
Uh-huh?

04:39.863 --> 04:41.536
I see it growin' on you.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.205
It's like Maxine when she first
tried it- I don't like it.

04:44.326 --> 04:47.956
You probably didn't get all- Hey, I try it.
I don't like it.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.707
That's all you can say? It
tastes bad in my mouth.

04:50.791 --> 04:55.012
It's like a fish and a turkey beat
themselves to death with a pepper.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.305
Okay, fair enough.
Maybe a little picky, though,

04:57.380 --> 04:59.303
from someone who prepared
a Colombian specialty ...

04:59.382 --> 05:02.727
and said, "Why are you not eating the hooves?
They're the best part."

05:04.596 --> 05:05.848
I'm back!

05:05.931 --> 05:08.104
Oh, hey, Uncle Cam.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.231
Oh, thanks again
for picking me up last night.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.358
You're welcome. But you
have to be more careful.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.984
I was the responsible one.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.941
Lisa was drinking, and I took
her keys, and then everything-

05:16.024 --> 05:17.276
I understand.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.737
My senior year, I had a
pretty crazy night myself,

05:19.820 --> 05:22.243
involving a bottle of corn
mash and an overturned plow.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.162
Seriously? Yeah. You
don't know terror ...

05:24.241 --> 05:26.619
until you've had to stare down the
eyes of a Missouri state trooper ...

05:26.701 --> 05:28.453
and talk your way
out of a P.U.I.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.298
Honey,
you don't drink coffee.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.842
I do when I've been up
half the night ...

05:33.917 --> 05:35.635
worrying about a project
that's only one-third done,

05:35.710 --> 05:37.758
and I still have an apron to sew,
scenery to paint ...

05:37.838 --> 05:40.682
plus my normal
crushing workload, so-

05:40.757 --> 05:42.885
Unless you have a better way
for me to stimul-

05:43.760 --> 05:45.888
God.
Coffee's bitter.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.814
That was your first sip?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.517
Okay, I got the chafing dish,
salt and pepper shakers.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.273
Perfect matches, both.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.446
I may have to
readjust my grapes.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.400
Huh. Wow. I'll just give
you a little privacy.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.323
Welcome back
to the light show.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.286
Hi.
Hi, Lily.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.285
Hi, Daddy.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.292
Lily. Sweetheart, no.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.540
No, no, no, no. We're-
We're not gonna do that today.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.668
Actually- Actually, Claire, we're trying
not to use the word "no" so much.

06:12.747 --> 06:16.217
We just read a book that said children
learn to rebel against that word.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.178
Uh-huh. So we redirect her
into a new activity instead.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.427
Here. Well, just watch this.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.600
Lily, sweetie, hi.
It's Daddy here.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.143
Would you like to listen
to some music?

06:25.260 --> 06:29.231
Okay. There you go. See?

06:29.306 --> 06:32.606
Every new generation thinks they have
cracked the code on child rearing.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.153
What's the latest theory?
"Never say no."

06:35.228 --> 06:37.572
I say no every day
in this house.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.274
But at night,
she's a yes machine.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.451
No.

06:41.526 --> 06:46.657
Well, it doesn't seem that she is redirecting
her own energy as much as using a lot of ours.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.416
But do you see how she's slowly
transitioning from the lights to the music?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.872
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

06:53.955 --> 06:58.461
It's hard to believe there was ever a time
when we just said, "Stop doing that."

06:58.585 --> 07:01.054
The garbage disposal.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.597
Lily. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.176
Not- Let's redirect you
into a nap, huh?

07:06.301 --> 07:10.272
Actually, we're doing this new thing where we
let her tell us when she wants to take a nap.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.475
It's called "being
your own nap captain."

07:12.557 --> 07:14.980
Mm-hmm.
Come on, sweetie.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.364
Hey, hey.
Phil.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.535
Hey. Did you
ring the doorbell?

07:24.611 --> 07:27.410
Oh, no, 'cause I have
these two coffees.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.203
One is for you.
Thank you.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.501
Here's my life-
A full-time job,

07:31.576 --> 07:33.954
a three-year-old
and a second one on the way.

07:34.037 --> 07:38.292
And as a favor, I agreed to do a
little work for Phil's agency.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.798
The problem is, I'm very good,

07:40.877 --> 07:43.426
and the more I do,
the more they want me.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.303
L-I even turned in
a few assignments late ...

07:45.382 --> 07:47.430
so that they'd fall out of
love with me a little bit.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.307
Right.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.309
How- How long have you
been standing here?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.272
Are-Are you- Are you all right?
Oh, yeah.

07:53.348 --> 07:57.353
- 'Cause you're really blinking.
- Mm-mmm.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.937
I'm a stress blinker.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.320
Um, and what really
gets me going is confrontation.

08:02.399 --> 08:06.029
Hate it. I-l avoid it at all costs.
Terrible at it.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.614
Once, I-l, uh- I tried to
break up with a girl,

08:08.697 --> 08:12.668
and I danced around it so much, she
didn't know I had broken up with her.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.665
Twenty years later,
we're still married.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.964
I am ... really sorry ...

08:19.040 --> 08:20.838
about the cold coffee.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.137
It's not that cold.
it's lukewarm, so-

08:24.254 --> 08:26.131
Okay, so- Funny story
about that expression.

08:26.256 --> 08:30.136
When the kids were younger, we had
a, uh- a wading pool. Uh-huh.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.267
And occasionally Luke would have an
accident and, um, Alex would scream.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.850
And we'd say, um, "It's okay, honey.
He's just making it lukewarm."

08:40.227 --> 08:42.400
What else? What else? So I
gotta get going, but I, uh-

08:42.480 --> 08:44.858
Okay, wait. I'm just gonna
come straight out and say it.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.943
Mitchell, you've done
a wonderful job for the agency ...

08:47.027 --> 08:49.246
since you decided you'd
help us out forjust a little bit.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.539
We couldn't
ask for more, could we?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.332
I wish it didn't have to end.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.833
In fact, if it was up to me,
you'd stay on forever, but it is not-

08:56.953 --> 08:59.206
Phil, Phil.
just up to me, is it, so-

08:59.289 --> 09:02.634
Phil, I saw this coming,
and-and- Look.

09:03.752 --> 09:07.222
I bailed. I made an
excuse and left.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.174
But I-I've- I've gotta be
straight with him.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.931
You know, "Phil, I cannot stay
on with your firm forever."

09:12.010 --> 09:14.513
Oh, God,
it's gonna crush him.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.690
Maybe I can get Claire
to do it.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.188
Well, that was easy.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.606
We're really proud of you, buddy.
See you at the ceremony.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.494
You're not a hero.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.534
I put out a fire.
A fire you started.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.076
Was there a fire?
Yes.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.620
Did I put it out?
That's not-

09:34.741 --> 09:36.835
Answer the question.
Yes.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.833
I'm getting an award for it.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.882
If they gave awards for starting fires,
I'd be getting one of those too.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.709
I know you have
a conscience, Luke.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.763
Do you see this flag?
It stands for justice.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.635
So when that fire marshal
gets here,

09:49.714 --> 09:53.184
I know you're going to look at
that flag, do the right thing.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.107
You were very quiet
all the way home.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.905
Are you upset at me because
I honked at that old lady?

10:05.980 --> 10:09.075
Normally we leave the honking to
the driver, but I'm used to it.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.993
Is it because
of the sandwich?

10:11.069 --> 10:14.539
You maybe could've eaten half of
it, said a couple of nice things.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.537
It's just a sandwich, Jay.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.664
It's not about
the delicious sandwich, Gloria.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.587
It's about being respectful
of a person's feelings.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.290
But I was
just being honest.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.796
You don't have to be honest about
every little thing in a relationship.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.128
Some things you say,
some things you don't.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.055
Oh. What are the things
that you don't say?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.924
Gloria, I really don't want to
do this anymore. Oh, really?

10:33.049 --> 10:36.223
But you cannot just try to teach me
a lesson and then not- Okay, fine.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.896
I don't say this, but it ...

10:38.972 --> 10:42.818
bothers me a little bit
that you're just a tiny bit loud.

10:42.934 --> 10:43.981
Loud?
Not all the time.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.858
Only when you-
you know, when you talk.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.778
So I embarrass you?
Gloria.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.280
What? Am I
being too loud again?

10:51.401 --> 10:53.495
All right. Buckle up.
Oh.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.868
I'm gonna go
and try to do the laundry,

10:55.947 --> 10:58.496
and I'm gonna do it very
quietly so I don't bother you.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.077
Maybe Manny can help me.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.296
Manny.
I get it.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.757
Manny.
I get it.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.424
Now you're not even
making any noise.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.968
Okay, this is
way too many grapes.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.178
And this spoon is modern
day, so if we use it,

11:18.261 --> 11:20.764
everyone at the table has to react in
shock at the spoon from the future.

11:20.847 --> 11:21.848
Okay-

11:21.931 --> 11:23.353
And that went
down the drain.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.026
And you need a nap.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.899
You need a nap.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.072
I got it. Ooh, I lost it. Shoot.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.445
Let me know if I can eliminate
any distractions for you.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.994
I got it. No, I got a finger on it.
There it is. Oh, lost it again.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.742
Maybe you should just
wait until it comes to you.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.495
You know, make it the captain
of its own spoon platoon.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.326
I understand the point
you're making, Claire, but-

11:41.409 --> 11:43.127
Oh, now I'm stuck.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.332
Yeah, Cam. You are stuck. You are stuck on
a philosophy that clearly doesn't work.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.133
Sometimes you need to
say "no" to a child.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.712
Yeah, and sometimes you
need to say "no" to an adult.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.139
No, Claire, no. I don't need help
raising my child.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.135
Oh, okay.
Sorry.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.188
Guess I do have a lot to learn.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.857
Right now, I'm looking forward to learning
if you will get your arm out of there ...

12:04.933 --> 12:07.857
before Lily gets
to the garbage disposal switch.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.237
Um- Lily, sweetie?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.739
- Can-Can you do something, please, Claire?
- I would like to, really.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.491
I would. But I would
probably just say no ...

12:17.570 --> 12:20.289
and shred her confidence
and mangle her self-esteem.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.539
Okay, fine. I'm sorry. Stop her! Stop her!
What to do? What to do?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.245
- Sweetie! Claire!
- What to do?

12:27.372 --> 12:30.376
Oh! Oh!

12:30.500 --> 12:32.343
Yes!  Ohh.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.928
Ohh.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.883
You think
that's funny, don't you?

12:38.007 --> 12:40.476
Yes. Well, it's wicked, Claire.
It's wicked.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.054
Come on.
We're leaving, Lily. Lily!

12:43.137 --> 12:48.268
It's living art. We stay perfectly still
for 90 seconds, basically doing nothing.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.567
Sounds like my first wife. I don't know.
She always moved for me.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.024
Long as you both agree
it was only 90 seconds.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.780
Two nerds with one stone!

12:55.858 --> 12:57.326
I love working in an office.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.575
Is that your brother-in-law?
I thought you fired him.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.407
- I did. Before work.
- Then what's he doin' here?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.333
Is he disgruntled?
He looks disgruntled.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.286
No, he always
looks like that.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.039
Hey. How's it goin'? Hey.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.591
Hey, listen. Okay, I know
this is uncomfortable,

13:11.666 --> 13:14.044
but we really need to talk
about my future here.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.762
But I- I thought we-
No, I know, I know.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.307
I led you to believe that I'd be able
to stay on here indefinitely and-

13:19.382 --> 13:21.760
Okay, okay.
Don't get all blinky.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.137
Oh.  it's not
all bad news, okay?

13:24.220 --> 13:25.938
You will have me until
July, like we agreed.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.436
Okay, great.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.525
Could you jump on the elevator
with me real quick? Yes, yes.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.942
I could use a hand carrying up some stuff
from my car.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.865
Oh, my goodness. I probably
need some empty boxes, don't I?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.443
You know what? You head down.
I'll meet you at the glass doors.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.449
There was something else. What was it?
I know it's in there.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.789
Oh, yeah. You're fired.
What? Fired?

13:42.864 --> 13:47.370
What's goin'
on with these things?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.791
You tryin' to open 'em?
Mm-hmm.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.589
I better get somebody.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.962
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're firing me?

13:54.042 --> 13:57.342
- I don't even like this job.
- That can't be safe.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.218
- Someone trapped in there?
- The guy they fired.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.425
- Oh, the lazy guy?
- Lazy?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.885
You handed in a couple of things late.
I should've warned you.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.515
I'm terrible
at breaking bad news.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.269
Then why did you come over to my
house and tell me how great I was?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.225
That was me
trying to fire you.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.278
I haven't felt like this since I tried
to break up with Claire 20 years ago.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.072
- Someone stuck again?
- That lawyer with the attitude they just fired.

14:16.147 --> 14:19.651
They said it was your attitude,
like you were doing us a favor.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.657
I was doing you a favor.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.239
- Why didn't he take the stairs like everyone else?
- Lazy.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.835
Don't worry.
He can't get you.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.210
Two hours I was stuck in there, with an
entire office of people staring at me.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.383
L- I finally had to lie down.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.295
Didn't help my reputation.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.215
Figures.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.937
You guys nailed it.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.982
Dude, that was surreal.
Get it?

14:59.065 --> 15:02.194
Dad, come on.
We have a minute to set up!

15:02.276 --> 15:03.744
Where are Mitchell and Cam?

15:03.820 --> 15:06.448
Hey, Manny. Thanks for what
you said before about the flag.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.166
It really got me thinking. I
knew you had a conscience, Luke.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.165
More importantly,
you've got a good-

15:11.285 --> 15:13.413
You didn't.
Yep.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.875
And thanks to you, I had them move the
ceremony to right under the flag.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.710
I'll sign a picture
for you.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.677
- Oh, there you are. I was afraid you weren't coming.
- It was a discussion.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.509
If we weren't gonna show up, we
would have clearly let you know ...

15:26.592 --> 15:28.139
and not humiliated you
in public.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.768
If it's any consolation, the
lawyer we hired to replace you ...

15:30.847 --> 15:32.349
is already
suing the elevator company.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.900
Ow! You're sitting on my hand.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.648
Be thankful you have two.
I almost lost one today.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.024
Stop being such a baby.
She was nowhere near that switch.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.106
Shh! Keep your voices down.
We're about to go on.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.692
Why are you looking at me?
Am I too loud?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.903
- Is that what everybody thinks?
- What?

15:44.986 --> 15:47.114
- There's a backstory here you don't want to know about.
- I want turkey.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.948
Save your
appetite, baby girl.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.284
And don't forget, afterwards we're
goin' to Lenny's for a bite to eat.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.165
More than a bite,
if you value my feelings.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.837
Oh, great.
We get to see Maxine.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.539
What?
You know Maxine too?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.249
- Oh, we all know Maxine.
- Love.

15:58.332 --> 16:02.508
Second best hugger in the world after
Mr. Burt Reynolds. Story to follow.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.807
Guys, this will all be over in 90 seconds.
Hold your poses.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.976
I really want to impress
Mr. Gorgeous.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.302
Jarvis! Shut up!

16:09.385 --> 16:12.138
Hey, Mitch,
I know this isn't a good time.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.064
I just want you to know,
I'm really-

16:14.140 --> 16:15.642
I know, Phil.
You're really sorry, okay?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.148
But this is gonna take me
a little time to get over, all right?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.275
Actually, I was gonna say I'm really
gonna need your parking pass.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.865
What?  Our
next stage presentation ...

16:22.940 --> 16:25.318
will be
Alex Dunphyis interpretation ...

16:25.401 --> 16:28.120
of Norman Rockwell's].943 painting
Freedom from Want.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.615
How do you
sleep at night, Luke?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.492
- With a medal around my neck.
- Shh!

16:32.575 --> 16:34.498
I want turkey.
Lily, no!

16:34.577 --> 16:36.796
She doesn't understand that word.
Cram it, Claire.

16:36.871 --> 16:40.000
Control your child, Cam. it's not that difficult.
I've raised three.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.334
Cam!

16:41.417 --> 16:43.761
Why don't you ask Haley
what time she got home last night?

16:43.878 --> 16:45.630
Uncle Cam! Sorry, dear.
Collateral damage.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.177
- What is he talking about?
- Shh!

16:47.298 --> 16:48.800
Your arms are shaking.
Oh, yeah.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.011
I'm sure that the great
Maxine can do a better job!

16:51.093 --> 16:53.767
You can criticize my parenting
all you like, Cam,

16:53.846 --> 16:55.519
but my son just won a medal.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.021
- For a fire he started.
- Luke, is that true?

16:58.100 --> 17:01.980
- Ow!
- A y, how long? It's getting heavy.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.857
You're not getting that parking pass back.
I tried to let you down easy.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.568
You don't know how
to talk to people, Phil.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.449
It's just like when Claire
didn't even know you dumped her.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.162
What?
When did Dad dump you?

17:10.238 --> 17:12.332
I didn't dump her.
I just tried to.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.034
I am losing it!
Just a few more seconds!

17:16.117 --> 17:19.041
I want turkey.  Lily, no!

17:20.455 --> 17:22.458
We really are
trying to not say that word.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.339
B-minus.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.340
But there was a silver lining.

17:27.755 --> 17:31.009
"L expected more, Alex."

17:31.092 --> 17:32.560
Alex!

17:32.760 --> 17:35.639
I am gonna call Haley and tell her
we're not going to that deli.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.268
I can't take
another minute of Cam.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.147
You know, I'm not even sure I believe
all these new parenting theories,

17:40.226 --> 17:43.196
but I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let her tell me they're wrong.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.739
We are not
going to dinner.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.487
I tried that sandwich.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.409
It's not that good.
You're not missing anything.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.862
I sure won't miss seeing
Luke and that stupid medal.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.073
I play by the rules.
Where's my medal?

17:53.155 --> 17:56.580
Jay can stay with that Maxine.
She's not loud, like me.

17:56.659 --> 18:01.005
In fairness, you can be a
little quick to give advice.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.799
Well, I'm always ready to help,
if that's what you mean, yeah.

18:03.874 --> 18:08.755
Yeah, but if you're not careful, it can
come off a little ... know-it-all-y.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.215
That's not a word.

18:10.298 --> 18:14.553
What you mean to say is it can
come off like I know it all.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.806
Have I always been this way? It's
why I wanted to break up with you.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.232
The word "fired"
doesn't even apply.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.106
You can't get fired
from a favor.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.403
Okay, sweetie.
Maybe you should just let it go.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.947
Like I always say, it's better
to carry a tune than a grudge.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.276
Okay,
you never said that, but-

18:29.358 --> 18:31.656
And what about this grudge
you're holding against Claire?

18:31.736 --> 18:33.534
I don't see you
trading that in for a tune.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.537
That is completely different. She
insulted my parenting skills.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.210
Which, you have to admit, you
can be pretty defensive about.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.835
Okay, so maybe we both
can be a little sensitive.

18:43.914 --> 18:46.087
N-No, no.
Mm-mmm, no.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.010
These are-
These are not equal.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.179
No, you have no idea what
it feels like to be fired.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.723
Yes, I do. I've been fired.
Everyone has.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.300
Not me.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.723
Never?
No. Nope.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.271
I've always been very
good at what I do.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.894
So then maybe
what you're feeling ...

19:00.973 --> 19:04.227
is a little insecure about
your work for the first time.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.443
That's hogwash.

19:07.521 --> 19:11.196
As someone who's seen actual hogwash,
I can assure you that it's not.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.654
I don't know why you're so
bothered by Maxine. She's nice.

19:14.737 --> 19:19.413
Oh, good. Why don't you, Jay and Maxine
live together eating sandwiches forever?

19:20.868 --> 19:22.495
Can I float
a theory here, Mom?

19:22.620 --> 19:25.544
You sound like you're jealous.
A y, please.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.092
Me, jealous of that woman?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.920
I just don't like the way
they talk to each other.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.678
And the little jokes, and she
knows everything about his life.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.601
Just makes me
feel like, uh-

19:39.720 --> 19:42.564
Is that jealous?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.940
A y, my poor sisters.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.783
Just you? I thought the whole
family was swinging by.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.156
Who knows what they're doin'? Right now
they're all sniping at each other.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.746
Ah, who needs 'em? Right. As
long as I have you, Maxine-

19:57.822 --> 19:59.870
I'm off in five.
Hey, Luke.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.997
What's with
all the hardware?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.829
Well, he set fire to his school
and lied about it.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.833
You know, they give medals for anything these days.
it's going back tomorrow.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.419
He doesn't get
a lot of medals.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.468
I just really need one of these today.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.386
Don't hold back.
Ohh.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.092
My girls.
There they are.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.677
Hello, hello.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.354
Hey, Cam. Hey!

20:22.430 --> 20:24.899
Come on in.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.983
- I, uh- I appreciate your coming.
- Yeah.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.530
And again, I really, really-

20:31.647 --> 20:32.739
Thank you.
Yeah.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.985
Here she is. Look who made it.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.570
Hola, Maxine.
So nice to see you.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.823
Let me get you some menus.
We don't need it.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.907
It's Jay Pritchetts
all around.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.255
Gloria, if you want your sandwich
without anchovies, I won't be offended.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.797
Ohh.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.546
Course, then it'll
be a Jack Feldman.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.841
Hey, have you ever gotten
a hug from Maxine?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.305
Hey. Yeah?

21:00.384 --> 21:02.102
- Hey, man.
- ls the repair guy here?

21:02.178 --> 21:03.805
He's workin' on it.
Um-

21:03.888 --> 21:06.516
Listen, uh, it's Katie's birthday-
Skip's assistant.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.522
Big 3-0. Still no ring.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.320
- You woke me up to tell me that?
- No. I grabbed you some cake.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.272
Oh. Sure it's not
for employees only?

21:13.355 --> 21:14.948
Okay, had that coming.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.776
- Who are you talking to, Phil?
- Mitchell.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.703
- Who?
- Mitchell, my bro- Uh, the lazy guy.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.373
Who was
doing you a favor.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.916
All right. Just give me the cake.
I'm hungry.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.455
No!

21:25.576 --> 21:27.249
Oh.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.167
