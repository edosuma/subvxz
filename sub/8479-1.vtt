I never thought I'd see a mayor of this city,
even this mayor,

14:52.773 --> 14:56.265
stoop so low as to steal the homes
of 30,000 hard-working New Yorkers.

14:56.410 --> 14:59.208

that I will not let this sale stand

Bolton Village is home to 37,512.

15:29.410 --> 15:32.641

it means inevitable eviction, Mayor.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.407
- Valliant thinks.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.518
What it means is better service,
more attentive landlords,

15:38.652 --> 15:41.644

when the toilet is blocked

15:41.789 --> 15:43.450

And, by the way, how are the renovations
coming on that $4 million townhouse of yours

38:19.211 --> 38:21.941
over in Brooklyn Heights?
- You want my house, too? Take it.

38:22.081 --> 38:25.050
I'm upside-down on my mortgage
like the rest of this city.

38:25.184 --> 38:27.812

by men like you.

38:31.390 --> 38:32.823

- Yeah?

38:32.959 --> 38:35.826

You stick to the issues,

38:47.640 --> 38:49.835
people will see the difference
between the two of you.

38:49.976 --> 38:51.176
- It's not clean enough, Paul.

38:51.243 --> 38:54.770
It's gotta be clean-cut.
He's got this clear line of attack on me.

38:54.914 --> 38:57.508
I'm the rich Connecticut carpetbagger.

He's a crook!

I need to be able to lay his fat ass flat!

Can I talk to you for a minute?

39:23.442 --> 39:25.842
Alright, so what's your problem, Jack?

39:26.012 --> 39:28.310
- The Daily News is my problem, Paul.

39:28.447 --> 39:31.041
The <i>Post</i>, the <i>Times</i>, they're all the same.
Pick one.

39:31.183 --> 39:33.708

a dump-truckload of shit on me

39:33.853 --> 39:36.879

39:37.023 --> 39:40.424
I thought that's what Montauk was all about.
What happened to that source of yours?

39:40.559 --> 39:42.459
- I'm working on it.
- So that's why you disappeared

39:42.595 --> 39:44.290
for nine hours yesterday?
- He kept us waiting.

39:44.430 --> 39:47.422
Kept us on the hook. I told you.
- You came back stinking of booze.

39:47.566 --> 39:50.262
- I had a fucking cocktail, sweetheart.
- So where is our pushback, then?

39:50.403 --> 39:54.100
- Our pushback are truth and facts, Jack.
That's how we play.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.401
- Where are our headlines?
That's all I wanna know.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.783
- I'll tell you something.
We don't need headlines, Jack.

39:58.911 --> 40:00.752
We don't need headlines,
because we're winning.

This is the best game in town, babe.
You got the commissioner over there.

But the commish don't miss a party.
It's like watching Italian opera, them two.

42:00.666 --> 42:02.634
- What the hell do you know about opera?

- But you used to. I can tell.

42:44.043 --> 42:45.067

42:51.650 --> 42:53.641
- Seven years.
- Good for you.

42:55.054 --> 42:57.352
Finally hit rock bottom, huh?

42:57.489 --> 42:59.457

42:59.592 --> 43:01.287
- Then you do believe in love.

43:01.427 --> 43:04.362
- I believe in lovin' the one you're with.
- Hmm. What are you,

43:04.496 --> 43:06.555

43:07.666 --> 43:08.928
- Both.

- Well... perhaps you could explain
what I'm doin' up here?

43:22.248 --> 43:24.546
- Being tailed is exhausting.

43:25.684 --> 43:29.552
If I might pry for a moment, how much
are you being paid for your efforts?

43:29.688 --> 43:32.748
- Which efforts are those?
- The work you're doing for the mayor.

43:35.094 --> 43:36.959
I'll give you $50,000

43:37.096 --> 43:39.087
to give it up.
- Well, that's very generous,

43:39.231 --> 43:41.825
but I got a contract with the mayor.
- Break it.

43:41.967 --> 43:44.333
- You don't break contract with the mayor.

43:44.470 --> 43:47.337
- Don't I know it.
- Why don't you just leave him?

43:47.473 --> 43:49.964
- This is not what you think it is,
Mr. Taggart.

43:50.109 --> 43:52.839
- I take pictures, Mrs. Hostetler.
I don't get paid to think.

43:52.978 --> 43:56.175
- If the last seven years of your life
mean anything,

43:56.315 --> 44:00.251

means anything... walk...

44:00.386 --> 44:01.785

you're investigating adultery,

Mr. Taggart, you don't know
Nicholas Hostetler very well.

44:20.239 --> 44:21.831
- I see you've met Billy.

44:21.974 --> 44:23.498
- Yes, we met.

44:24.310 --> 44:26.608
- Did he tell you
he's doing some work for me?

44:26.745 --> 44:30.010
- He mentioned it.
- Did he mention it was exclusive?

44:30.149 --> 44:31.673
- Yes, he did.

44:31.817 --> 44:34.149
- You used to know what exclusive meant,

Well, don't worry...

01:16:31.235 --> 01:16:32.896
I had papers in my trunk,

01:16:33.036 --> 01:16:35.061
a fuckin' boxful,
all with mockups and renderings

01:16:35.205 --> 01:16:37.799
of some New York skyline
that doesn't exist right now,

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:40.205
but will as soon
as they tear down Bolton Village.

01:16:40.344 --> 01:16:43.575
Until some goons blind-sided me.
- Yeah, we ID'ed him from his license plate.

01:16:43.714 --> 01:16:45.272
- Who is he?

01:16:45.415 --> 01:16:47.246
- Ex-homicide cop. Dick Murdock.

01:16:47.384 --> 01:16:49.784
You know him?
- Yeah, he works for Sam Lancaster.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.754
- He might work for Sam Lancaster,
but he's on Hostetler's payroll.

01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.552
- Say again?
- All that paperwork you got in your trunk,

01:16:56.693 --> 01:16:59.719
not to diminish your new beauty mark,
but it's fucking worthless.

01:17:00.697 --> 01:17:02.927
Everyone knows Solstein Donagan's
gonna tear down Bolton Village

01:17:03.066 --> 01:17:04.795
as soon as the political dust settles.

01:17:04.935 --> 01:17:08.302
A few even know they already hired
the Rochway Group to do it.

01:17:08.438 --> 01:17:11.430
- Really? So why is Paul Andrews dead
if it was such an open secret?

01:17:11.575 --> 01:17:15.773
- Well, he was about to figure out the rest.
- What rest? What fuckin' rest?

01:17:15.912 --> 01:17:20.042
Doesn't anybody in this town
speak in complete fuckin' sentences anymore?

01:17:21.285 --> 01:17:26.348
- Todd Lancaster was meeting with Andrews
that night to bring him a contract.

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:28.788
Somebody didn't want that to happen.

01:17:28.925 --> 01:17:33.794
Now, I myself almost secured the contract
from Todd, but now he's not talking.

01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:35.295
He's scared.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.929
- Well, the contract is proof of the deal
to tear down Bolton Village.

01:17:40.737 --> 01:17:43.297
<font color="#D900D9">(FAIRBANKS SIGHING)</font>
- That's part of it.

01:17:46.343 --> 01:17:48.140
Only Todd Lancaster knows the other part.

01:18:13.503 --> 01:18:16.700
And welcome to third and final
New York City mayoral debate.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.502
At this time,
join me in welcoming our candidates:

01:18:19.643 --> 01:18:22.168
Mayor Nicholas Hostetler
and Councilman Jack Valliant.

01:18:34.491 --> 01:18:36.686
- Manual windows?
- Yeah.

01:18:36.827 --> 01:18:38.761
- That's how you got
those masculine forearms.

01:18:38.895 --> 01:18:40.863
- Where'd you think I got 'em,
from stroking your ego?

01:18:40.997 --> 01:18:43.693
Big booty: good.
Big forearms: no good.

01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:46.735
C'mon, let me drive. What the fuck?

01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:49.430
- You're an asshole!
- I didn't do it on purpose! Let me drive.

01:18:49.573 --> 01:18:52.440
- Oh, my God! You ruined my car
before you even started driving it.

01:18:52.576 --> 01:18:54.009
- I apologize.
- Where are we goin' again?

01:18:54.144 --> 01:18:56.669
- Don't worry about it. Get in.
- What do you think I'm doing?

01:18:56.813 --> 01:19:00.078
- Whoa. Where'd you get these seat covers,
the Gaza Strip?

01:19:00.217 --> 01:19:04.051
- In a Valliant administration,
we will be focusing on two key principals:

01:19:04.187 --> 01:19:07.122
Shared responsibility and shared sacrifice.

01:19:07.257 --> 01:19:11.318
<i>For those of you who are fortunate enough
to earn more than $200,000 a year,</i>

01:19:11.461 --> 01:19:14.055
<i>we'll ask that you pay
a little more in taxes.</i>

01:19:14.197 --> 01:19:18.099
<i>For those of you who don't,
well, we'll bring down the payroll tax.</i>

01:19:18.235 --> 01:19:20.635
It's responsible and it moves us forward

01:19:20.771 --> 01:19:22.432
towards a balanced budget
and a secure future.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.439
- Mayor.

01:19:25.575 --> 01:19:27.839
- I think it is laughable that my opponent

01:19:27.978 --> 01:19:29.969
can be up here
espousing fiscal responsibility

01:19:30.113 --> 01:19:35.073
when it is a known fact he has never
met a tax he didn't want to raise.

- This coming from the man

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.486

- No, this is coming from the mayor

01:19:41.658 --> 01:19:43.626
who got us out of it.
- Yeah!

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.251
- By selling New Yorkers' homes
out from underneath them.

01:19:46.396 --> 01:19:48.261
By selling public housing

01:19:48.398 --> 01:19:49.922
to a Wall Street equity firm.

01:19:50.066 --> 01:19:53.307
I believe the residents of Bolton Village
would have much preferred a tax increase

01:19:53.437 --> 01:19:55.462
to an eviction notice.
<font color="#D900D9">(APPLAUSE)</font>

01:19:55.605 --> 01:19:58.096
- I'm telling you this, Councilman:
no matter where a New Yorker lives,

01:19:58.241 --> 01:20:01.142
<i>nobody wants a tax increase.</i>
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)</font>

01:20:01.278 --> 01:20:02.609
- Nor do I.

01:20:02.746 --> 01:20:06.443
And I believe it's time that you told
the truth about the Bolton Village deal.

01:20:06.583 --> 01:20:09.950
- Here's the truth:
We have a $3 billion surplus.

01:20:10.086 --> 01:20:14.079
Now, we can use that
to put our people back to work.

01:20:14.224 --> 01:20:17.955
<font color="#D900D9">(APPLAUSE)</font>
We can use that to bring tax relief to folks.

01:20:18.094 --> 01:20:22.190
That's the truth.
- No, that's not even close to the truth.

01:20:22.332 --> 01:20:24.823
You made a sweetheart deal
with Solstein Donagan to line

01:20:24.968 --> 01:20:26.629
your own pockets.
To buy your way

01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:30.706
out of a deficit that your broken policies
created in the first place.

01:20:30.841 --> 01:20:32.331
<i>The truth of the matter is,</i>

01:20:32.476 --> 01:20:36.435
<i>you continue to lie to the good people
of this city about their intentions.</i>

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.346
<i>Solstein Donagan did not buy Bolton Village
to get into the landlord business.</i>

01:20:40.484 --> 01:20:44.045
<i>Solstein Donagan bought Bolton Village
to get into the skyline business.</i>

01:20:44.187 --> 01:20:46.485
Pure and simple.
- Peter, I believe we've gone

01:20:46.623 --> 01:20:50.081
into the area of slander.
- Solstein Donagan, in their 50-year history,

01:20:50.227 --> 01:20:52.821
has never bought a property
intended for residential use,

01:20:52.963 --> 01:20:55.557
and I highly doubt they intend to start now.

01:20:55.699 --> 01:20:58.998
- I don't how much clearer
I can make it for you.

01:20:59.135 --> 01:21:01.000
<i>To the people of Bolton Village,</i>

01:21:01.137 --> 01:21:04.004
<i>there's only one reason I got into this deal.</i>

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.040
<i>Because I want better for you.</i>

01:21:06.176 --> 01:21:07.575
There is a new day dawning

01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:10.680
<i>in Bolton Village.
And if Solstein Donagan,</i>

01:21:10.814 --> 01:21:14.580
if they step out of line,
if they don't fulfill their promises,

01:21:14.718 --> 01:21:18.210
<i>then I will smack them back into shape.</i>

01:21:18.355 --> 01:21:20.255
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)</font>
<i>That is my oath.</i>

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:22.381
- Well, unfortunately for you, Mayor,
we're all well aware

01:21:22.526 --> 01:21:24.551
what that oath has been worth.
- The fact remains,

01:21:24.694 --> 01:21:26.355
the debt is gone.

01:21:26.496 --> 01:21:28.536
- There are other ways
to move us toward solvency...

01:21:28.565 --> 01:21:30.362
- Name one.
- ... Besides larceny.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.899
I'll tell you

01:21:32.035 --> 01:21:34.635
<i>what I would've done.
First, I would've done something my opponent</i>

01:21:34.738 --> 01:21:37.104
<i>clearly feels is beneath him
and that is to seek</i>

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.265
the counsel of my betters
on this crucial issue.

01:21:39.409 --> 01:21:42.378
I would've convened a panel of respected
economists to help us solve this.

01:21:42.512 --> 01:21:44.309
- Respected economists
to have an in-depth look...

01:21:44.447 --> 01:21:46.472
We all know about that panel, Councilman.
- Legality and...

01:21:46.616 --> 01:21:49.346
- That's the same panel
that put us into default in the '80s.

01:21:49.486 --> 01:21:51.977
New Yorkers need more than a panel, son,
they want solutions.

01:21:52.122 --> 01:21:54.852
- New Yorkers want...
- There is only one person up on this stage

01:21:54.991 --> 01:21:56.618
in the business of providing solutions.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.523
The other one up here is in the business

01:21:58.662 --> 01:22:00.943
of saying how dire the situation is...
- Is this a debate,

01:22:01.031 --> 01:22:04.797
<i>or are we being treated
to a Nick Hostetler soliloquy?</i>

01:22:04.935 --> 01:22:06.596
The issue is dire.

01:22:06.736 --> 01:22:09.432
Because you and your cronies
have rigged the game.

01:22:09.573 --> 01:22:13.907
And honest, hardworking New Yorkers
recognize that nothing will change.

01:22:14.044 --> 01:22:17.741
Nothing will ever change
if we continue to elect men like this.

01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:20.008
- Tell me things have not changed!

01:22:20.584 --> 01:22:22.711
When I was elected mayor,

01:22:22.852 --> 01:22:25.446
this was a broken city.
Broken.

01:22:25.589 --> 01:22:28.456
Step by step, I've been getting it fixed.

01:22:28.592 --> 01:22:32.084
Bolton Village
is just another one of those steps.

01:22:32.228 --> 01:22:33.525
Tell me things haven't changed.

01:22:33.663 --> 01:22:37.656
I just stood before you all
and told you we have a $3 billion surplus...

01:22:37.801 --> 01:22:40.326
- Mayor...
- Tell me things haven't changed.

01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:42.438
No other mayor
in the history of this great city

01:22:42.572 --> 01:22:45.336
has been able to stand in front of the people
and tell them that!

01:22:45.475 --> 01:22:48.156
When you step out of your house,
in the morning, with your children,

01:22:48.178 --> 01:22:50.908
you take 'em to the parks
of the five boroughs, d'you feel safe?

01:22:51.047 --> 01:22:52.446
Yes, you do,

so why don't you just tell me
the fuckin' truth?

01:30:26.269 --> 01:30:27.930
- The truth is...

01:30:28.071 --> 01:30:29.868
I hired you...

01:30:30.506 --> 01:30:32.064
...to investigate my wife.

01:30:32.208 --> 01:30:33.971
- Investigate her for what?

01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:37.079
- For not minding her own business,
is for what.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.714
For having a big mouth, is for what.

01:30:40.516 --> 01:30:42.916
For asking too many questions, is for what.

01:30:43.052 --> 01:30:45.077
You better be careful
following her example, Billy.

01:30:45.221 --> 01:30:48.088
I might have to hire someone
to investigate you.

01:30:48.224 --> 01:30:50.454
- Who you gonna have do that?
Your boy Murdock?

01:30:50.593 --> 01:30:53.084
I don't think he's available for the job.

01:30:54.297 --> 01:30:57.698
- I hope he didn't suffer.
- No more than Andrews did.

01:30:58.534 --> 01:31:01.765
- Damn shame what happened to that man.
- So tell me this, then, Mayor.

01:31:01.904 --> 01:31:06.364
Did you really think I'd let you turn me
into an accessory to murder? For $50,000?

01:31:06.509 --> 01:31:08.602
What, d'you think
I wouldn't ask any questions?

01:31:08.744 --> 01:31:10.905
Or d'you think I wouldn't get any answers?

01:31:11.547 --> 01:31:14.015
- What answers you got, Billy?
- Oh, I know Andrews

01:31:14.150 --> 01:31:17.608
was about to link you to Bolton Village.
That's the reason you got rid of him.

01:31:17.753 --> 01:31:20.813
- No, sir. Not me.
- Not you.

01:31:20.957 --> 01:31:22.788
The man you hired. Murdock.

01:31:22.925 --> 01:31:25.120
- Try getting that testimony.

01:31:25.261 --> 01:31:27.593
- Yeah. You're good, Mayor.
I give you that.

01:31:27.730 --> 01:31:29.823
You got it all worked out, huh?

01:31:29.966 --> 01:31:32.161
The denial about Bolton Village.

01:31:32.301 --> 01:31:35.293
The discount to Solstein Donagan.
The new big contract

01:31:35.438 --> 01:31:39.101
to the Rochway Group.
Nobody can do a goddamn thing about it, huh?

01:31:39.242 --> 01:31:42.370
'Cause anybody that could is either dead
or you bought 'em.

01:31:42.512 --> 01:31:45.140
I'm fuckin' impressed, Mayor. You're good.

01:31:45.281 --> 01:31:48.148
- Perhaps that's why the people
keep electing me, Billy.

01:31:48.985 --> 01:31:51.545
Because I simply get the job done.

01:31:51.687 --> 01:31:54.520
- So all this, it was all for the city?

01:31:54.657 --> 01:31:56.989
- Everything I do is for this great city.

01:31:57.126 --> 01:32:00.027
- The city doesn't own 50%
of Rochway Group, Mayor.

01:32:00.163 --> 01:32:01.630
You do.

01:32:02.365 --> 01:32:04.299
Look what I got.

01:32:09.372 --> 01:32:11.499
- What you got in your hand?

01:32:11.641 --> 01:32:13.268
- It's your fuckin' jugular, Mayor.

01:32:16.145 --> 01:32:19.171
Fifty percent of $4 billion
is a lot of fucking money.

01:32:20.383 --> 01:32:22.943
So here's how this works.
I got an email in my outbox

01:32:23.085 --> 01:32:25.519
with a scanned copy
of that Rochway contract attached to it.

01:32:25.655 --> 01:32:27.680
I click one button
and 100 different newsmen

01:32:27.823 --> 01:32:29.916
are gonna read your name
alongside Sam Lancaster's

01:32:30.059 --> 01:32:31.492
in black and white.

01:32:31.627 --> 01:32:34.118
Don't worry Mayor,
I got the original nice and safe.

01:32:34.263 --> 01:32:36.754
You resign, you step down,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

01:32:36.899 --> 01:32:39.026
Those emails'll never see the light of day.

01:32:39.168 --> 01:32:41.193
But that Bolton Village deal... is dead.

01:32:41.337 --> 01:32:45.433
Now you wanna tear down
100 other projects as a civilian, so be it.

01:32:45.575 --> 01:32:48.908
But Bolton Village is gonna stand
and you're gonna walk away.

01:32:49.045 --> 01:32:51.411
That's the deal, Mayor.
I suggest you take it.

01:32:51.547 --> 01:32:52.639
- Counteroffer.
- No need.

01:32:52.782 --> 01:32:55.774
I got nothing left for you to threaten.

01:32:55.918 --> 01:32:58.910
- I want the originals,
I want all the copies,

01:32:59.055 --> 01:33:01.080
and I want your case file.

01:33:01.224 --> 01:33:03.215
By... 9 a.m. tomorrow.

01:33:03.359 --> 01:33:04.849
- You're done, motherfucker.

01:33:05.428 --> 01:33:09.194
You are done.
- You ever spend a goddamned minute

01:33:09.332 --> 01:33:11.892
thinking why I chose you, Taggart?

01:33:12.034 --> 01:33:14.059
And I did choose you.

01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:16.667
I chose you.

01:33:18.074 --> 01:33:19.837
Because I own you.

01:33:20.876 --> 01:33:24.243
Now, you'll gonna have to excuse
the quality of the videotape.

01:33:25.248 --> 01:33:28.740
It was shot on one of those camcorders
they used to sell you hot,

01:33:28.884 --> 01:33:30.442
