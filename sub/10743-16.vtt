22:05.324 --> 22:06.990
A really wonderful kid.
              Uh, Richard?

22:06.992 --> 22:08.459
Sure, oh, yes, yes, yes.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.494
It's-- All he needs is
a little understanding.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.095
It's amazing
how much fun you can have

22:12.097 --> 22:13.497
when you understand
each other.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.298
We've been having
such a good time,

22:15.300 --> 22:17.067
I was wondering
if he can spend the night.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.735
I could bring him over
in the morning--

22:18.737 --> 22:19.870
               Major Nelson.
We could--

22:19.872 --> 22:21.572
                 Major Nelson.
    Yes, sir.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.706
                Where is he?
       Who?

22:22.708 --> 22:24.174
  Uh, oh, Richard.
     I'm sorry.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.009
Yes, he's--
Well, he's out on the patio

22:26.011 --> 22:28.445
assembling some model airplanes
we've been working on.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.646
           He didn't smash them?

22:29.648 --> 22:31.815
Mm, well, there were a couple
of little accidents.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.116
Nothing important.
                   Uh, yes.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.417
          Uh, may I see him now?

22:34.419 --> 22:35.886
       Uh, well,
I'd rather you didn't--

22:35.888 --> 22:37.220
              Uh, now, major.

22:37.222 --> 22:38.288

      Yeah.

                      Gentlemen.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.862
Ah, good evening,
general.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.430
       Yes, yes, general.
       How are you, sir?

22:46.432 --> 22:47.597
                 Good evening.
                  How is Gina?

22:47.599 --> 22:48.765
            Gina?
        Oh, wonderful.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.868
         Wonderful kid.
     Just a charming girl.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.903
                Aren't you proud
                 of him, doctor?

22:52.905 --> 22:55.806
I will be as soon as I see
my nephew changed

22:55.808 --> 22:58.108
into a well-behaved
little boy.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.210
Richard?

22:59.212 --> 23:00.677
         Uh, doctor...
         Uh, general--

23:00.679 --> 23:03.981
You don't have
to say a word, major.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.251
The evidence will speak
for itself.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.320
       --intelligent to make
   a model as beautiful as that.

23:10.322 --> 23:11.321
I didn't make it.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.990
I just fixed it.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.225
Most girls would think
that's kids' stuff.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.062
                      GINA:
                 Oh, no, I think
                 it's wonderful.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.731
    You do?
    Really?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.799
I'm making a rocket at home.
  I don't believe it.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.868
              Gina's talking.
Come over and see it sometime.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.571

I certainly owe you
an apology, Major Nelson.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.540
How in the world
did you ever do it?

23:35.614 --> 23:36.913
    May I see you
     to your car?

23:36.915 --> 23:38.349
                   Mm-hm.

  Amazing.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.221
How'd you say
you did that?

23:44.223 --> 23:45.456
         Yeah,
  read the book, sir.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.625
Oh, I did, I did.

23:48.627 --> 23:52.162
It all seemed so terribly
simple in school.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.930
              Good night, major.
Oh, good night, sir.

23:53.932 --> 23:54.931
                And thanks--

23:54.933 --> 23:56.367

        Oh, yeah.

       There's only one problem.

 Well, what is that,
       master?

              If you used magic
             on those children--

24:08.947 --> 24:10.046
 Oh, but I did not.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.048
I did not. All I did
was bring them together.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.751
                Yeah, and then
                what happened?

24:13.753 --> 24:17.053
Oh, you must read
the last chapter, master.
