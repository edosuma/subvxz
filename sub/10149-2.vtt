WEBVTT

01:17.161 --> 01:18.663
What?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.504
Get a load of the freak
in the long johns.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.923
You really haven't been
in Gotham long, have you, kid?

01:29.006 --> 01:30.633
Halt or we'll shoot!

01:38.849 --> 01:39.850
Get him!

02:21.767 --> 02:22.977
Can't you read?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.354
That soup is hot enough
to turn your arm to ash.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.565
It's all right, I brought protection.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.620
You'll excuse me
if I don't stay to chat.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.499
But I've got to deliver this
while it's still hot.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.670
Nice try.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.630
But you're playing with fire, Batman.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.718
[Uaughs]

03:40.179 --> 03:42.765
The vial contained
a rare man-made isotope.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.725
- Beta Sterillium.
- How rare?

03:44.809 --> 03:47.520
That was the only sample.
It's very unstable.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.939
That's why it was stored
in the meta-caloric liquid.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.733
I couldn't even touch him.
He repelled everything.

03:52.817 --> 03:54.485
The Batarangs, the hole.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.837
I've never seen anything like it.

03:55.861 --> 03:56.862
Ihave.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.209
This center is dedicated
to developing new and better

04:10.292 --> 04:12.253
iso-environments for those patients

04:12.336 --> 04:15.256
whose immune systems are unable
to cope with the toxins and microbes

04:15.339 --> 04:16.424
of the real world.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.178
You mean they live alone
in these little boxes?

04:21.262 --> 04:22.262
Glacial.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.766
Well, that's why we've been hard at work
trying to come up with better solutions.

04:25.850 --> 04:27.893
These bubble suits
developed in the last decade

04:27.977 --> 04:31.522
allowed our patients access
to the real world for the first time.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.192
However, they're much too cumbersome
for day-to-day living.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.612
That's why we're so excited
by our newest invention.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.075
The iso-field generator rings.

04:43.159 --> 04:47.413
When worn properly, these devices
create a die-gravitational aura

04:47.496 --> 04:48.622
which repels all matter,

04:48.706 --> 04:51.417
forming a safe barrier
between the patient and the environment.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.543
Impressive.

04:52.626 --> 04:56.005
As you can see, Irene is
completely protected by the aura,

04:56.088 --> 04:58.257
and yet it allows her
near normal dexterity.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.636
I'd be interested in examining
the specs, if you don't mind.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.763
Of course, Mr. Wayne. Right this way.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.728
- For you.
- Thanks

05:11.228 --> 05:12.228
OW-

05:12.855 --> 05:13.689
Thorns.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.608
Sorry.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.026
- Smells beautiful.
- Does it?

05:17.109 --> 05:18.277
Can't you smell through that?

05:19.695 --> 05:21.113
Nothing gets through the aura.

05:21.197 --> 05:23.741
- Then how do you breathe?
- An oxy device.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.868
Recycles the 002 into breathable air.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.663
It's kind of like carrying
my own ecosystem around with me.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.892
Does anyone else use the device
when you're not using it,

05:31.916 --> 05:34.335
like when you go out to dinner
or something?

05:34.418 --> 05:35.961
Did I say something funny?

05:36.045 --> 05:38.839
Yeah... "Dinner"? "Out"?

05:38.923 --> 05:40.966
I've lived here my whole life.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.093
The furthest I've ever been
from my iso-cell

05:43.177 --> 05:44.970
is the top floor of this building.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.597
You mean you've never been outside?

05:48.140 --> 05:50.726
Fascinating.
Can I get a copy of this data?

05:50.809 --> 05:53.729
I'd give you a download,
but our security system won't allow it.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.857
Dr. Suzuki! What's going on here?

05:56.941 --> 05:58.943
Uh... Dr. Blades, this is...

05:59.026 --> 06:00.694
I don't care who it is.

06:00.778 --> 06:03.322
No one outside R&D
is allowed access to the files.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.824
- Understand?
- I'm sorry, Dr. Blades.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.910
It won't happen again, HI... I...

06:09.870 --> 06:11.997
And you, what makes you think
you can rummage

06:12.081 --> 06:13.600
through my files like you own the place?

06:13.624 --> 06:15.209
Because I do.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.544
Bruce Wayne.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.172
The rules apply to everyone,
even to you, Mr. Wayne.

06:20.839 --> 06:21.839
I was just curious

06:21.882 --> 06:23.759
about the power capabilities
of the device.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.843
What about them?

06:24.927 --> 06:26.647
It seems to me
that if the overload problems

06:26.679 --> 06:27.680
could be addressed,

06:27.763 --> 06:29.848
the iso-field would make
a rather formidable weapon.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.393
Ah. So that's it.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.186
Well, you can tell
your board of directors

06:34.270 --> 06:36.897
that I will never participate
in that kind of research.

06:36.981 --> 06:38.816
Not for you,
not for the Defense Department,

06:38.899 --> 06:39.900
not for anyone.

06:39.984 --> 06:43.529
Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Wayne,
I have real work to do.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.383
Ew. This place stinks.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.719
Don't get overheated. He'll be here.

07:06.802 --> 07:07.802
So you say.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.394
Power down, dog. That's our contact.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.279
Always the dramatic entrance.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.823
Let's have it.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.159
Isotope Beta Sterillium.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.043
You only charged us half as much
for the Alpha Sterillium.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.129
This turned out to be
a bit more complicated.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.048
Yes, we heard about Batman.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.966
My people are concerned.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.843
We still need the gamma isotope.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.178
You'll get it.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.223
If he gets in my way again...

07:55.017 --> 07:56.352
Scratch one bat.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.488
Considering she lived her whole life
in an iso-lab,

08:07.571 --> 08:08.864
it's amazing how mature she is.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.699
Yeah. Mature.

08:10.783 --> 08:12.409
At the same time, she's kind of naive.

08:13.535 --> 08:14.787
Like a little girl.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.330
Sounds like your dream girlfriend.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.093
I hope you two
will be very happy together.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.750
Come on, Dana, it's not like that.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.919
She lives in a bubble, for Pete's sake.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.480
Couldn't even touch her if I wanted to.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.190
Maybe that's why
you find her so attractive.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.216
- What?
- Boys.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.717
They always want the unattainable,

08:28.801 --> 08:31.553
and they're willing to sacrifice
what they already have to get it.

08:31.637 --> 08:35.599
Dana, I'm sorry I went on about Irene.
I'm done, okay?

08:36.725 --> 08:38.811
Hold on a sec. Hello?

08:38.894 --> 08:41.522
Terry? It's me, Irene.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.023
Oh. Uh...

08:43.107 --> 08:45.025
Hi! Look, I'm a little busy right now.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.403
Not anymore you're not.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.486
Dana!

08:50.197 --> 08:51.907
<i>Terry, you have to come get me.</i>

08:51.990 --> 08:53.701
<i>I'm out in the city and I'm lost.</i>

08:53.784 --> 08:55.327
They let you out on your own?

08:55.828 --> 08:57.913
No, I escaped.

09:02.418 --> 09:04.461
Come on in!

09:04.545 --> 09:07.172
No, thanks.
I don't want to get my feet wet.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.096
I wish I could get my feet wet.

09:16.265 --> 09:19.935
I can't feel the waves at all.
I can't even smell the ocean.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.730
But the sound, the sound is incredible.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.985
Sometimes it's the only way
I feel like I know something.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.154
Like the sound of my favorite music.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.280
Or someone's voice.

09:34.450 --> 09:35.451
I'm sorry.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.369
The aura creeps a lot of people out.

09:37.453 --> 09:39.788
It's not that, it's...
There's this girl.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.832
Oh, my gosh! We gotta go!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.292
- What?
- Hurry!

09:43.375 --> 09:45.335
I've only got
about 20 minutes of power left!

09:45.419 --> 09:47.713
We have to get back to the lab, now!

09:59.808 --> 10:02.853
- Dr. Blades, we...
- I don't want to hear it.

10:02.978 --> 10:06.607
You have violated your privileges,
Irene, and my trust.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.400
It wasn't all her fault, Dr. Blades.

10:08.484 --> 10:11.570
Young man, as of this moment,
you are banned from this institution.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.280
- Permanently!
- No!

10:13.363 --> 10:16.867
And you, you will go to your iso-cell
and remain there without access

10:16.950 --> 10:20.662
to the dia-grav rings
until you learn some responsibility.

10:20.746 --> 10:21.746
Now!

10:35.677 --> 10:38.722
I know I should have told her
about Dana, but she's so vulnerable.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.766
- And besides...
- You like the attention.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.268
Yeah. No! Not exactly.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.480
I do like her and I like being with her,
but it's not like...

10:47.105 --> 10:48.105
You wouldn't understand.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.441
Actually, I do.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.921
When I was younger,
women used to throw themselves

10:52.945 --> 10:54.238
at my feet all the time.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.615
- What did you do?
- I stepped over them.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.159
- Smooth.
- I thought so.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.372
Another isotope was stolen this month
from the university.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.873
Probably by the Repeller.

11:04.957 --> 11:08.585
Ingredients for something. But what?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.212
Together, they make nothing.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.798
But throw in a third, Gamma Sterillium,

11:12.881 --> 11:15.133
and you have the makings
of a very powerful explosive,

11:15.217 --> 11:17.511
which in the wrong hands...

11:17.594 --> 11:19.781
I'm guessing you can't buy
Sterillium at the Sav-O Mart.

11:19.805 --> 11:20.681
No,

11:20.764 --> 11:23.559
but there's a good supply of it
at the BIUdhaven nuclear facility.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.936
And I was hoping to catch up
on some homework tonight.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.527
Don't worry, I won't be late.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.362
I'm going to be gone all evening, Irene.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.114
The lab will be rather empty,
I'm afraid.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.592
But it should give you time
to reflect on the irresponsibility

11:39.616 --> 11:40.742
of what you did.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.396
Yo.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.064
<i>- Is Terry there?
- Nope.</i>

12:11.148 --> 12:12.983
Can you give him a message for me?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.693
Tell him Irene called.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.029
I found a way to get to the iso-rings.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.323
<i>Tell him to meet me tonight
at the beach.</i>

12:19.406 --> 12:21.658
Got that? It's important.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.910
Mmm-hmm.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.453
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.714
I had a feeling you'd drop by.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.056
I think you should
put away the spitballs.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.059
But these are the extra special ones.

12:52.356 --> 12:55.359
Titanium, the strongest alloy
known to man.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.568
It's unbreakable.

12:56.652 --> 13:01.740
Nothing is unbreakable...
if you apply enough force.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.555
Like drowning a rat.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.032
I have the isotope.
Batman?

15:07.115 --> 15:08.617
He's dead.

15:21.713 --> 15:22.839
Rene!

15:24.966 --> 15:26.551
What's goin' on?

15:36.770 --> 15:37.896
<i>Anything broken?</i>

15:37.979 --> 15:40.148
If I said yes, could I go home?

15:40.357 --> 15:41.357
No.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.986
I've been going over
the lab's invoices and purchase orders.

15:45.070 --> 15:49.282
Someone's put in a lot of requests
for power-boosting servo circuitry.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.705
Suzuki, what have you done?

15:55.789 --> 15:58.625
Only what you were
unable to do, Dr. Blades.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.002
Boost the power of the dia-grav rings.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.088
- But the theoretical limits...
- Limits?

16:06.133 --> 16:07.801
There are no limits.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.761
And I decided
it would be more profitable

16:09.845 --> 16:11.888
if I kept that discovery to myself.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.477
I knew a control freak like you
would catch on to me eventually, doctor.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.318
Aah!

16:30.866 --> 16:33.034
I'm sorry you had to be drawn into this.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.035
Aah!

17:08.862 --> 17:09.862
Ha!

17:31.176 --> 17:32.176
Hey!

17:33.970 --> 17:35.263
Work day's over!

17:35.347 --> 17:36.347
Aah!

17:54.366 --> 17:56.076
Haven't we danced this waltz before?

17:56.159 --> 17:57.494
Humor me.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.686
What are you going to do, blow me away?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.521
Something like that.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.401
Stop it! Stop!

19:48.772 --> 19:51.524
It was a terrible thing
what Dr. Suzuki did,

19:51.608 --> 19:53.902
but at least it got Dr. Blades
to lighten up a little.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.072
Say, there's a new roller coaster
opening down at the beach.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.323
Do you wanna go with us?

19:58.406 --> 20:01.368
Listen, Irene, you probably
don't wanna hear this,

20:01.451 --> 20:03.953
but my friend, Dana,
she's more than... us?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.580
Come on, Irene, we're gonna be late.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.707
- Be right there, Larry.
- "Larry"?

20:07.791 --> 20:09.292
We've been friends for years.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.586
Actually, he's more than a friend.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.046
I'm sorry.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.383
I meant to tell you about him,
but I could never find the right time.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.853
So how'd she take it?

20:30.146 --> 20:31.523
Better than I thought.
