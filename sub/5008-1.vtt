03:32.795 --> 03:35.631
Go, get out of here.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.466
Go!

03:53.942 --> 03:56.860
They say the higher
you aim...

03:57.070 --> 03:59.154
...the farther you fall.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.115
Fuck you, Eddie Kim.

04:02.283 --> 04:05.535
And look at you now,
Mr. Prosecutor, huh?

04:05.703 --> 04:07.996
Not so high and mighty anymore.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.169
Well, that's a noble gesture.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.964
I'll make sure to tell
your son all about it.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.677
The reason he gets
to grow up without a father...

04:21.844 --> 04:24.471
...is because of how
goddamn noble he was.

04:26.224 --> 04:30.852
Then again, I was raised
by a single mom and...

04:32.522 --> 04:35.399
...I didn't turn out so bad, huh? Whoo!

04:42.156 --> 04:44.324
Clean this up.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.243
I'm going back to L.A.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.923
Let's get the hell out of here...

05:00.133 --> 05:01.675
...and find that guy!

05:05.138 --> 05:08.515
This is Mi Jung Lee reporting live
from the Kaena Point area.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.685
Details remain sketchy in
the brutal slaying yesterday...

05:11.853 --> 05:14.229
...of Los Angeles prosecutor
Daniel Hayes...

05:14.397 --> 05:15.897
...who was vacationing
in Hawaii.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.774
Hayes has been in the news lately...

05:17.942 --> 05:22.404
...for his high-profile pursuit of reputed
mobster Edward Kim.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.115
Mr. Kim's representatives
have issued a statement...

05:25.283 --> 05:27.451
...of condolences to the Hayes family...

05:27.660 --> 05:29.619
...and claim absolutely
no involvement...

05:29.787 --> 05:31.538
...in what they call
a hideous act...

05:31.706 --> 05:35.751
...of violence. The ongoing
saga in the criminal investigation...

05:35.918 --> 05:38.920
...of Mr. Kim involves charges
of murder, racketeering...

05:39.088 --> 05:41.798
...and police corruption
at the highest levels...

05:41.966 --> 05:44.384
...both here in Hawaii
and on the mainland.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.094
Thank you, Mi Jung.

05:46.262 --> 05:50.307
We'll be sure to check in for
any updates as they become available.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.743
Do as I say, and you live.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.621
Stay flat against this wall.
Don't even breathe.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.343
Go, go, go, that way!

06:32.100 --> 06:33.475
Black car, go!

06:49.492 --> 06:51.368
What the hell is going on?

06:51.536 --> 06:55.163
You witnessed a murder and didn't tell
anybody. Why didn't you call the police?

06:55.331 --> 06:57.833
The news said they were corrupt.
I figured they'd be in on it.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.501
Smart kid.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.128
Who are you?

07:01.295 --> 07:03.380
I'm Agent Neville Flynn, FBI.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.465
Pleased to meet you, Sean.

07:18.396 --> 07:21.231
I gotta tell you, Sean,
I'm getting tired of all this garbage...

07:21.399 --> 07:22.983
...you've been feeding me.

07:24.819 --> 07:28.530
We know you were there. Your prints are
all over it. Stop insulting my intelligence.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.701
You witnessed a murder.
You have a responsibility.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.710
Look here, Sean.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.880
I've been doing this for a while,
so I know all kinds...

07:45.047 --> 07:47.090
...of neat little
interrogation tricks.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.384
You know, good cop,
bad cop...

07:49.552 --> 07:53.346
...reverse psychology,
stare-down contests, threats.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.725
You name it,
I've done it.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.060
But why don't we
leapfrog all that bullshit?

07:59.228 --> 08:03.940
Save ourselves a lot of aggravation and
time, of which there is close to zero...

08:04.108 --> 08:06.443
...and I tell you the truth?

08:07.236 --> 08:11.531
The truth is, I'm not worried
about you if you testify.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.867
But I am worried
about you if you don't.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.583
What if I didn't see him clearly?
I mean, I wouldn't be...

08:21.751 --> 08:25.253
What did I just tell you about saving us
aggravation and time?

08:25.421 --> 08:27.297
He knows who you are!

08:27.465 --> 08:30.592
That's why those people
were at your house trying to kill you.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.302
And make no mistake...

08:32.470 --> 08:35.639
...Eddie Kim will kill you...

08:35.847 --> 08:37.432
...if you let him.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.811
Last week I was planning
a surfing trip to Bali.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.439
Now...

08:44.607 --> 08:46.775
Now you make it sound
like I have no choice...

08:46.943 --> 08:49.486
Oh, no, no, no.
You got choices.

08:49.654 --> 08:54.449
You got tons of choices,
but there's only one correct choice:

08:54.617 --> 08:56.618
Come with us to L.A...

08:56.786 --> 08:58.495
...testify against his ass...

08:58.663 --> 09:01.581
...put him in jail for life.

09:01.749 --> 09:05.293
Tell you what.
You sit here, think about it.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.005
You let us know what you decide.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.633
We'll be outside.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.440
The white zone is for immediate loading...

09:27.608 --> 09:29.442
...and unloading of passengers only.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.487
So you got any requests
for your final flight?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.824
Well, just what
any flight attendant wants.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.743
- Low-maintenance passengers.
- Uh-huh.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.329
That would be very nice.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.963
All right, ladies. Hey, Troy, Leroy,
I got this. Let me sign them for them.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.965
Let me sign them.
Give me that marker.

09:52.133 --> 09:56.177
How you doing, sweetie?
You all right? There you go.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.804
You take care, baby.
All right.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.765
- Can I get your autograph?
- You can get a little more than that.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.727
No doubt. Let me do this on
the special for you right there.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.731
- Yeah.
- It tickles.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.860
- Take care, all right?
- All right.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.905
- Will you sign this, please?
- Yah, no doubt, little man. Here we go.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.158
- There you go.
- Thank you.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.036
- Hey, yo, stay black.
- Hells, yeah.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.873
All right. All right, y'all.
God bless you. I gotta get out of here...

10:25.041 --> 10:28.084
...and catch this flight.
Y'all take care. Catch the next album.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.962
- We can't wait.
- Yeah, all right, no doubt.

10:31.714 --> 10:35.884
All right, look, we gotta make sure
we got some more of this, all right?

10:36.052 --> 10:39.554
- Look at the Howard Hughes of rap.
What? What was that?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.890
He said, man,
can you believe this crap?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.392
- This is crap right here.
- Hey, come on, y'all.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.771
Y'all messing with t-shirts.
Y'all supposed to be watching my back.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.356
Come on.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.316
Ladies and gentlemen...

10:51.484 --> 10:53.902
...South Pacific Air
flight 121 has been delayed half an hour.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.321
Oh, come on!
- We apologize for this inconvenience...

10:56.489 --> 10:59.616
...and we'll begin boarding...
- Oh, boy. It's gonna be a fun flight.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.369
Aloha all Island Express passengers...

11:03.996 --> 11:05.288
Five whole hours.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.416
Do you know who's working today?
I didn't get a crew list.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.878
You know, I have no idea.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.214
Oh, my God.
Here she comes. Here she comes!

11:15.591 --> 11:17.050
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

11:17.927 --> 11:19.386
Oh!

11:20.930 --> 11:23.640
Oh, Claire, don't go.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.934
Last thing the world needs
is another lawyer.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.104
- I mean, how could you leave all this?
- It's gonna be hard.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.649
Will you take me with you?
Please.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.318
Did we ask for Bruno
from Simply Corporate?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.446
Elena, by we, I mean you.

11:38.614 --> 11:41.282
No, not all drivers are the same.
That's the point.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.119
The last thing I need is some guy
going on and on...

11:44.286 --> 11:47.414
...about the weather
the whole way home. Get Bruno.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.918
Mary Kate, hush.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.463
Sorry, she gets nervous flying.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.966
Oh, that's okay.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.093
I understand, you know.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.928
Do you think she'll
want some Xanax?

12:02.096 --> 12:05.140
Oh, no, she's okay.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.479
How you feeling?

12:11.647 --> 12:13.148
Yeah, fine.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.358
You ready for this?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.444
Yeah.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.448
Is that our plane?

12:21.615 --> 12:25.285
No, every cop in Honolulu thinks it is.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.872
Hey, come on, relax.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.558
FBI's escorting some guy to L.A.

12:48.726 --> 12:52.312
- They just took over all first class.
- Are they allowed to do that?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.355
Well, apparently
FAA Section 108 states...

12:54.523 --> 12:57.025
..."if deemed necessary," they can
do whatever they want.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.028
Who's gonna tell the first class
passengers they're flying coach?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.030
That would be you, kid.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.548
South Pacific Air 121.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.721
Oh, my.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.849
I was hoping you'd
be the sky candy on this flight.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.519
You're looking especially
delicious this evening.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.395
I love it when you demean me, Rick.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.065
My pleasure.
I gotta go fly a big plane.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.609
- Hi, doll.
- Hi there, Rick.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.402
Isn't he smooth?

13:45.366 --> 13:48.535
Yes, sir. I'm soaking the leis with it.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.579
The pheromone will make
these guys go fucking crazy.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.918
Duke.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.926
Leave it, Duke.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.934
- Ladies.
- Welcome aboard.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.395
Agent Flynn.

14:21.443 --> 14:25.613
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the final boarding call for South Pacific Air...

14:25.781 --> 14:27.824
- Thank you.
... with nonstop service to Los Angeles.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.909
- Aloha.
- No, no, no, the hair.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.578
Thank you.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.251
Unfortunately, first class is overbooked.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.753
But there's plenty of room
to stretch in coach...

14:40.921 --> 14:43.631
...which is less than half full.
For the inconvenience...

14:43.799 --> 14:47.260
...we are offering you a free travel
coupon good on any South Pacific flight.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.430
A free travel coupon won't
help me get to my meeting on time.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.141
Sir, I'm pretty sure
that coach gets to Los Angeles...

14:53.309 --> 14:54.642
...the same time as first.

14:54.810 --> 14:58.479
Funny. Does my premium awards
membership come with sarcasm...

14:58.647 --> 15:00.982
...or should I speak
to your supervisor, Claire?

15:03.319 --> 15:06.362
This better be a matter
of national security.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.364
Did I just hear
there's no first class?

15:08.532 --> 15:10.283
I'm afraid only coach is available.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.869
Coach? Is it safe there?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.457
Yes, it is safe there.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.010
Never flown first class before.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.013
See? Things are looking up already.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.354
So how long you and Mr. Personality
been working together?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.065
Five years...

15:42.274 --> 15:44.734
...one blown marriage each.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.570
He's the toughest son of a bitch
I ever met.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.364
Wow.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.908
Yep, that's us.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.202
The glamour and the glory.

15:55.829 --> 15:59.707
Flynn, the captain's patching us
through to Harris for the flight.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.842
Harris, Special Agent Harris.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.220
Harris, so how's the new promotion?

16:12.388 --> 16:15.390
- I'm loving it.
- That was a little quick.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.725
- Wanna try again?
- No, no, I'm serious, man.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.895
You know, no more
junk food hangovers...

16:21.063 --> 16:23.439
...after all-night stakeouts, you know?

16:23.607 --> 16:26.609
I'm actually spending nights
in bed with my wife.

16:26.819 --> 16:31.072
She's hot. You know, and my kids, you
know, forget about them. They're kids.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.533
I'm just spending every
waking minute with them.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.118
You know, they're fun.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.412
Please, this is me you're talking to.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.081
You know you miss it.
You miss the action.

16:40.249 --> 16:44.293
You're bored to tears. So, what are you
actually doing with your time?

16:44.461 --> 16:46.754
- Surfing the net.
- Porn, no doubt.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.133
No, hey, eBay, my cynical-minded friend.

16:50.342 --> 16:54.095
I'm right in the middle of a bidding war
with this punk-ass kid from Iowa...

16:54.263 --> 16:56.264
...for this black velvet...

16:56.432 --> 16:58.307
...Pamela Anderson poster.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.268
Not technically porn.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.937
So how's Eddie Kim doing?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.815
You ain't gotta worry about him.
He ain't going anywhere.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.483
No, I got three teams on him,
so he's not gonna move.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.570
All right, I'll see you
on the other side.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.963
Are you sure about this?

17:30.090 --> 17:32.341
Accidents happen.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.677
You think I didn't exhaust
every other option?

17:35.471 --> 17:36.763
He saw me!

17:36.930 --> 17:38.931
You're right down this aisle to the left.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.350
- Thank you.
- Oh, look at the little baby.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.186
- He's beautiful.
- Thank you.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.648
- Oh, beautiful.
Cheese.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.358
First, they stick me in coach...

17:49.526 --> 17:52.653
...and then they put a dog
next to me. What the hell is next?

17:52.821 --> 17:54.322
Oh, you're adorable.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.950
Okay.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.789
Oh, great. Just great.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.209
Is there a problem, mister?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.920
Oh, gee, what do you think?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.300
Will you at least
get that vermin to shut up?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.010
Don't worry, Mary Kate.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.846
His hair plugs can't hurt you.

18:21.308 --> 18:25.061
Fucking dog, fucking coach,
fucking Americans!

18:25.229 --> 18:29.524
Hi. Oh, I'm really sorry about first
class. Let me see if I can help...

18:29.691 --> 18:31.984
Oh, sweet... Could you tell her
not to touch me?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.653
Oh, please, don't touch the man.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.531
Man don't like to be touched.
We'll find our own seats.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.117
Oh, sorry.
Here's some coupons.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.203
- You all right, man?
Yeah, I'm all right, man.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.051
All right.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.053
Coach ain't looking
so bad after all.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.395
Bad boy.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.482
Hey, yo, check it.
Check it out, check it out.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.568
You like that.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.737
Baby got back,
front and side-to-side.

19:16.905 --> 19:21.284
Hey, y'all two get together, y'all might
have two 20-pound babies or something.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.873
Dad, why can't you come with us?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.875
Come on, you're gonna be fine.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.585
Bet you're even gonna have fun.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.087
- He's just being a baby.
- Curtis.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.590
I'm counting on you to be a man.
What does a man do?

19:35.757 --> 19:37.633
- He looks out for his family.
- Right.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.761
- Sir.
- Oh, sorry.

19:40.929 --> 19:44.932
My wife is meeting them in L.A.
It's their first time flying solo.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.852
That's okay.
Hey.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.062
- Can I tell you a secret?
- What?

19:50.230 --> 19:52.607
- Guess who's on the plane?
- Who?

19:52.774 --> 19:55.443
- Three G's.
- For real?

19:55.611 --> 19:57.278
I bet you could meet him.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.322
Come on, Tommy, let's go.

20:13.170 --> 20:17.006
Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to
welcome you to South Pacific Airlines...

20:17.174 --> 20:21.510
...flight 121 nonstop service
from Honolulu...

20:21.678 --> 20:24.096
...to Los Angeles. I would
like your attention...

20:24.264 --> 20:29.352
...as the flight attendants demonstrate
the safety features of this aircraft.

20:29.561 --> 20:33.105
When the seat-belt sign illuminates,
you must fasten your seat belt.

20:33.273 --> 20:38.361
There are several emergency exits on the
aircraft located in the forward section...

20:38.570 --> 20:42.990
...aft section and over each wing.
In the event of decompression...

20:43.158 --> 20:45.159
...an oxygen mask will drop...

20:45.327 --> 20:47.161
...from a compartment
above your seat.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.998
To start the flow of oxygen, pull
the mask towards you, place it firmly...

20:51.166 --> 20:52.833
...over your nose and mouth...

20:53.001 --> 20:56.504
...secure the elastic band behind your
head and breathe normally.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.674
A lifejacket is located in a pouch
under your seat.

20:59.841 --> 21:02.802
This is how you put it on.
Slip it over your head...

21:02.970 --> 21:04.804
...pass the straps around your waist...

21:04.972 --> 21:06.973
...and adjust loosely at the front.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.893
Tampering with, disabling or destroying
the smoke detectors located...

21:11.103 --> 21:14.146
...in the lavatories
is prohibited by law.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.607
We wish you an enjoyable flight.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.828
Radar indicates a bit
of weather up ahead.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.871
We might catch
a few bumps in the road...

21:31.039 --> 21:33.916
...but we'll be above most of it.
If you need anything...

21:34.126 --> 21:36.752
...you holler at one of those
gorgeous flight attendants...

21:36.920 --> 21:39.547
...and they'll take good care of y'all.
Thank you.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.716
Good evening.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.640
Thank you.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.312
I'm Tiffany.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.106
Hi, Tiffany. I'm Sean.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.112
So, mind if I...

22:03.280 --> 22:05.031
...ask what you did?

22:05.782 --> 22:07.408
Oh, me? Nothing.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.872
It's what I'm supposed to do.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.291
Ever heard of Eddie Kim?

22:15.459 --> 22:20.087
Oh, who hasn't? I was watching
one of those crime shows once...

22:20.255 --> 22:23.215
...you know, with the hokey
reenactments...

22:23.383 --> 22:26.302
...where he tortured this guy who was
a witness against him...

22:26.470 --> 22:28.429
...by gouging out his eyes...

22:28.597 --> 22:31.474
...and then feeding him to some pigs.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.310
Pretty gruesome stuff.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.271
Yeah, he doesn't mess around, that guy.

22:37.439 --> 22:41.275
So, you know, what are you...?
What do you have to...?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.944
I'm a witness for the prosecution.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.114
- Wow.
- Yeah.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.617
That is so...

22:50.410 --> 22:52.244
...hot.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.645
I'm gonna miss these night flights.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.731
I enjoy the passengers so much better
when they're unconscious.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.402
And you, I'm gonna miss you.

23:26.655 --> 23:30.366
- Excuse me. Can I get a gin and tonic?
- Yes. I'll be right back with that.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.867
Thanks.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.710
In Hawaii for a vacation?

23:41.920 --> 23:44.964
Not really. I was there for
the kickboxing tournament.

23:45.382 --> 23:49.468
Oh, my God.
You're a kickboxer? Me too.

23:49.636 --> 23:53.222
Well, I take a kickboxing
class with Lonnie, Malibu Fitness.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.182
- Awesome cardio.
- Good for you.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.518
My girlfriend and I go
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.855
- Yeah, girlfriend. Right.
- Wait, wait. Watch this.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.276
Come on, take it easy, buddy.
You okay?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.863
- Oh! Oh! Son of a... Yeah, yeah.
You all right, dude?

24:09.030 --> 24:11.198
Hey, will you look around?

24:11.366 --> 24:13.242
Look around the plane.

24:13.410 --> 24:16.370
How come there aren't
more people on this flight?

24:16.538 --> 24:18.414
I can't figure it out.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.292
Honey, because it's the red eye.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.673
Okay, okay.

24:27.841 --> 24:31.177
- I'm sorry, sweetie.
- No, I accept... I accept that.

24:31.344 --> 24:36.015
If you hated flying this much, why'd you
let me pick Hawaii for our honeymoon?

24:38.185 --> 24:41.312
Because that's where you wanted to go.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.114
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.454
- Bali, huh?
- What?

24:58.622 --> 25:01.040
You said earlier
you wanted to go to Bali.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.751
It's a very beautiful place.
I've been there.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.213
You surf?
You don't look like a surfer.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.757
- No disrespect.
- Hey, none taken.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.426
And I did try it.
I figure, why spend all my time...

25:12.594 --> 25:17.139
...in the ocean when I could lay on
the beach and admire all the beauties?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.099
Couldn't stay on
your board, could you?

25:19.267 --> 25:21.435
No. Fell off every time.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.896
Got me.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.296
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm just stretching my legs.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.465
Big plane, plenty of places to do it.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.760
Plenty of other places to do it, you mean.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.389
I do something wrong here?

25:59.599 --> 26:01.016
Technically, no.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.811
Next time, you people
could give us a heads-up...

26:03.979 --> 26:05.688
...before you commandeer the plane.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.316
You people?

26:09.484 --> 26:11.277
Oh, no, no, no.
I...

26:11.444 --> 26:14.488
Hey, hey, don't stress it. Just joking.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.491
So can I...?
Can I get you something or...?

26:17.659 --> 26:20.619
No, I'm cool.
Just pretend I'm not here.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.496
Okay.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.586
Psst-psst.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.171
Psst.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.146
- Hi.
- What's up?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.189
This is Mary Kate.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.525
- Yes, that's nice.
- And I'm Mercedes.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.528
- You know, like the car. Vroom-vroom.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.530
- Yeah.
- She likes you.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.158
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Say hi.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.702
- You are?
- Oh, come on now.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.538
Yeah, I'm...

27:04.706 --> 27:07.875
- Trying to steal my dog?
- Oh, believe me, I don't want the dog.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.543
I'm kidding. I know who you are.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.170
- I know you know.
- Three G's.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.547
All right, all right,
"Booty Go Thump. "

27:13.715 --> 27:16.550
- Yeah, my booty went thump.
- Yeah, I know that's right.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.177
That's tight. That's tight.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.555
Yeah, your dog, the dog.
No, that's good. It's cool.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.266
- Yeah, love, yeah, I love dogs.
- Little kiss.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.454
- Hi.
- Aloha.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.171
Here.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.550
- Come on, come out.
- Hurry.

28:45.140 --> 28:49.476
You see, at the end of the day,
the music business is still a business.

28:57.652 --> 29:01.196
- You okay?
- I'm good. As I was saying...

29:01.364 --> 29:05.492
...see, I'm all about taking the music
and the business to the next level.

29:05.660 --> 29:08.036
You know what I'm saying?
That's when evolution...

29:08.204 --> 29:09.872
...becomes revolution.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.838
Here, babe.

29:21.676 --> 29:23.969
Screw it.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.843
Harder.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.426
Mile High Club.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.931
Those were the days.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.228
Oh. This guy is really good.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.776
Well, maybe not that good.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.094
We just lost avionics.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.436
Notify LAX.

31:38.521 --> 31:41.106
LAX, Hula one-two-one...

31:41.274 --> 31:42.858
...mayday, mayday, mayday.

31:43.026 --> 31:46.945
We are 1500 nautical miles
southwest of Los Angeles.

31:47.113 --> 31:50.115
Repeat, mayday,
we have lost avionics.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.492
Hula 1-2-1, heavy,
Los Angeles tower.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.162
We acknowledge your emergency.
You have priority.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.998
All right, give me the manual.
Take control.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.541
I have control.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.706
I'll be back.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.221
How's my big boy?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.443
Ah! Fuck!

33:11.864 --> 33:14.199
Fucking bitch!
Get off my dick!

33:15.076 --> 33:16.410
Fuck!

33:19.038 --> 33:21.206
Fuck.

33:58.077 --> 34:01.455
Because, you know, keeping your sexy
right is part of the business too.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.958
And if you don't mind me saying, it looks
like you keep your sexy very, very right.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.836
Well, thank you.

34:08.004 --> 34:11.089
Have you ever acted before?
- No.

34:11.257 --> 34:14.134
I would love to put you
in one of my pool-party videos.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.011
- Yeah?
- Throw a little thong on you...

34:16.179 --> 34:19.139
- Excuse me, she just wants a treat.
- All right.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.851
I can never find
anything in here.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.896
Her doctor says she's bipolar.

34:28.649 --> 34:30.192
I almost beat the last level.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.194
Man, you playing
that damn video game?

34:32.402 --> 34:34.696
Or was that video
game playing you, son?

34:34.906 --> 34:37.616
- Damn!
- Found them.

35:14.862 --> 35:18.198
Sir, I can assure you,
there's no strange smell.

35:18.366 --> 35:22.202
Maybe you're allergic to the leis.
Let me take them for you.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.162
Oh, yeah.

35:25.748 --> 35:29.543
Thank you, miss. Any idea
how long this turbulence will last?

35:29.710 --> 35:31.545
No, I'm okay.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.172
Well, I'm gonna go and ask the pilot.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.390
Shit, Rick, we got smoke.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.017
Something probably
arced in the avionics.

35:52.275 --> 35:55.527
How much longer do you think
before we climb...? What happened?

35:55.695 --> 35:59.489
We lost the board.
I gotta reset the breakers.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.410
- Keep her steady, Rick.
All right.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.813
Okay, cap, they're coming back!

36:38.654 --> 36:41.448
That's it, old man,
we're back in busin...

36:44.619 --> 36:46.620
Captain!

36:48.748 --> 36:49.956
- Rick!
What is it?

36:50.124 --> 36:52.667
Something's happened to the captain!

36:53.127 --> 36:55.462
All right. Coming.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.299
Oh, Christ.

37:00.134 --> 37:03.803
- Did you...? Did you see what happened?
No.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.141
Captain?

37:11.062 --> 37:13.146
I think he's had a heart attack.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.155
Agent Flynn, Agent Sanders...

37:22.323 --> 37:24.157
...can I see you
for a moment, please?

37:41.884 --> 37:44.302
I flew with that man for 10 years.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.013
Let's go back.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.724
We're halfway. It'd take longer
to get back to Honolulu...

37:49.892 --> 37:51.685
...than keep going to L.A.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.646
Make sure everybody's strapped in.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.363
LAX tower,
this is Hula one-two-one...

38:03.531 --> 38:07.534
...mayday, mayday, the pilot in command
has suffered a fatal heart attack.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.869
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain requests...

38:10.037 --> 38:13.164
...that you remain in your seats
with your seat belts fastened.

38:13.332 --> 38:14.916
Thank you.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.920
Shh. Shh.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.069
Hi, how are you doing?

38:43.863 --> 38:46.114
Think of it like a roller coaster ride.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.908
- Do you like roller coaster rides?
- No, not really.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.704
No, me neither.
They always make me sick.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.373
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

38:55.541 --> 38:59.294
You are gonna close your eyes
and count very slowly to 10.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.715
And when you open your eyes, you make
the funniest face you can at each other.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.384
And whoever laughs first loses.

39:06.552 --> 39:09.304
Okay? Best out of five wins.

39:09.472 --> 39:12.390
And I will be back
to check on the winner.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.772
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

39:18.939 --> 39:21.816
- Sir, seat belt please.
Yeah. Great.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.443
Thank you.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.966
Oh, my God!

39:48.135 --> 39:49.803
What the...?

39:57.853 --> 39:58.895
What the hell?

40:10.449 --> 40:13.159
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck?

40:13.994 --> 40:15.495
I'll go.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.792
Oh, shit.

40:38.352 --> 40:41.563
- Get down!
- What the hell? It's snakes!

40:51.866 --> 40:54.826
Rick, what's up with
the oxygen masks deploying?

40:54.994 --> 40:56.494
Oh, sorry about that.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.330
You won't believe what came out
of the instrument panel.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.207
What?

41:01.375 --> 41:02.917
Look at this.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.003
Goddamn snake, honey!

41:24.064 --> 41:25.940
John! Stay up here!

41:29.528 --> 41:30.904
Flynn!

41:34.033 --> 41:37.911
I've got ophidiophobia. Fear of snakes.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.584
Stay! Mary Kate, sit!

41:45.753 --> 41:47.378
Bad girl. Bad, bad girl.

41:52.259 --> 41:55.136
Come to the front, there aren't any
snakes here! It's safe.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.652
Everybody, move forward!

42:10.861 --> 42:12.612
Cautiously!

42:19.620 --> 42:21.246
Come here.

42:48.315 --> 42:51.067
Get out of my way!
Get out of the way!

42:52.820 --> 42:54.195
Son of a bitch!

43:04.832 --> 43:06.583
Out of the way, grandma!

43:14.633 --> 43:16.718
What the...? Fuck!

43:22.641 --> 43:24.934
Oh, my God, help!

43:31.025 --> 43:33.359
Help!

43:55.591 --> 43:57.592
Go, go!

43:57.760 --> 43:59.552
Oh, fuck me!

43:59.720 --> 44:01.220
Okay, okay.

44:01.388 --> 44:02.722
Oh, fuck, fuck.

44:02.890 --> 44:06.517
Oh, shit, shit!

44:12.107 --> 44:14.400
Who's your daddy now, bitch?

44:16.111 --> 44:18.029
Oh, fuck!

44:20.199 --> 44:22.617
Man, you guys are supposed
to be watching my back!

44:22.785 --> 44:25.787
Front, come on.
We gotta get to the front!

44:27.081 --> 44:28.206
Grab a tray table!

44:33.754 --> 44:35.463
Smash that!

44:35.631 --> 44:38.007
Little bitch! Come on!

44:39.760 --> 44:41.469
Move!

44:41.637 --> 44:43.930
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

44:45.766 --> 44:48.101
Get this fucking snake off my ass!

44:48.644 --> 44:51.062
Snap. You got a snake on
your ass! Yo, hold still!

44:51.230 --> 44:52.563
- Get it off!
- Get him out!

44:52.731 --> 44:54.941
- Get him out of here!
- Come on, man, come on.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.404
Keep moving! Keep moving!

45:02.616 --> 45:05.243
Everybody listen!
We have to put a barrier...

45:05.411 --> 45:07.286
...between us and the snakes!

45:07.454 --> 45:09.789
Grab everything from the overheads,
under the seats...

45:09.957 --> 45:12.667
...and let's build a wall.
Let's go!

45:28.100 --> 45:30.268
- Ken! Do this.
- Okay.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.480
Help me!

46:16.648 --> 46:18.691
Please help me!

46:28.869 --> 46:31.996
I'll put you on my back. We'll
move towards the front, okay?

46:32.206 --> 46:33.998
- No, I can't.
- Here we go! Come on.

46:34.166 --> 46:36.542
Let's go. Yes, you can.
You can do it, come on, up!

46:36.710 --> 46:38.753
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Mary Kate!

46:38.921 --> 46:40.880
Here we go.

46:50.516 --> 46:53.017
I need everyone to close
any compartment that's open!

46:53.185 --> 46:54.560
Just close them!

46:58.524 --> 47:00.358
I can't reach it.
I got it.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.193
Let me get it.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.071
Hey. Whoa. It's only me. What's up?

47:05.239 --> 47:07.615
- I can't find those two little boys.
- Little boys?

47:07.783 --> 47:10.660
Tommy and Curtis,
they were by themselves.

47:17.751 --> 47:21.212
- Hey!
- Mister, my brother... He got bit.

47:24.091 --> 47:25.883
I was supposed to take care of him.

47:26.051 --> 47:29.887
You are taking care of him, sweetheart.
You're taking care of him right now.

47:30.055 --> 47:32.765
- Is he gonna die?
- No, honey.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.768
But you have to be brave
for him now, okay?

47:35.936 --> 47:37.019
Okay, sweetheart.

48:11.722 --> 48:12.763
Are you okay?

48:14.391 --> 48:16.809
My baby!
Where is my baby!

48:24.818 --> 48:27.028
Oh, Lord.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.247
Oh! Oh!

48:40.334 --> 48:42.710
Oh, my baby!
- Here you go.

48:42.878 --> 48:45.421
- Go, go, go! Hurry!
- Thank you!

48:46.298 --> 48:48.966
Come on! Come on!
Come through! Hurry, hurry!

48:50.886 --> 48:53.012
Help! I need help!

48:55.557 --> 48:57.808
Oh, my God, Grace.

48:58.936 --> 49:01.145
Okay, okay.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.982
Okay.

49:05.150 --> 49:07.318
- Let me, let me. I got her.
- Oh, my God.

49:07.486 --> 49:09.362
I have to go and tell Rick.

49:10.989 --> 49:14.200
Grab the first-aid kit!
Grace, hey, hey, hey.

49:14.368 --> 49:17.161
Here's some water. Come on,
man, you got to drink water.

49:17.329 --> 49:19.580
Breathe, breathe.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.707
We missed the bastards...

49:21.875 --> 49:24.335
...because they were cold-blooded.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.337
Come on, come on.

49:26.505 --> 49:28.714
John, John, listen to me. You're okay.

49:28.882 --> 49:31.717
Just take a deep breath, John,
you're having a panic attack.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.603
Oh, shit.

49:47.192 --> 49:49.110
You've gotta be kidding me!

49:53.073 --> 49:54.824
Good luck.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.411
John?

50:10.966 --> 50:13.217
Son of a...

50:13.385 --> 50:16.721
Hey, hey, hey, we have to
figure something out.

50:16.888 --> 50:18.764
All right. Well, I know what I gotta do.

50:18.932 --> 50:20.725
We're in a 200-foot aluminum tube...

50:20.892 --> 50:24.937
...and we're 30,000 feet in the air. Any
one of those slimy little pieces of shit...

50:25.105 --> 50:27.481
...can trip a circuit
or a relay or a hydraulic...

50:27.649 --> 50:30.151
...and this bird goes down
faster than a Thai hooker.

50:30.360 --> 50:33.738
So my job is to keep LAX informed
on how totally screwed we are...

50:33.905 --> 50:36.407
...and then find some way
to keep this mother...

50:36.575 --> 50:39.952
...in the sky another two hours.
Figure that out.

50:41.913 --> 50:44.457
- Hey, hey, where you going?
- I have to go down.

50:44.624 --> 50:47.418
I have to help the passengers.

50:51.298 --> 50:53.632
There's supposed to be
a doctor aboard. A Dr...

50:53.800 --> 50:56.135
...Robert Foster. Robert Foster!

50:56.303 --> 50:58.846
Wait, here he is.
Here he is. Dr. Robert Foster...

50:59.014 --> 51:02.683
...row 11, seat H.

51:18.784 --> 51:20.117
Yeah, Harris.

51:21.453 --> 51:23.496
Sanders is dead.

51:25.499 --> 51:28.834
You know all those goddamn
security scenarios we ran?

51:29.002 --> 51:31.670
Well, I'm smack in the middle
of one we didn't think of.

51:31.838 --> 51:33.339
What the hell you talking about?

51:33.507 --> 51:36.884
Eddie Kim somehow managed
to fill the plane with poisonous snakes.

51:38.011 --> 51:40.346
Wait, hold on.
What kind of insane plan is that?

51:40.514 --> 51:43.682
He can't possibly guarantee
that the snakes are gonna get to Sean.

51:43.850 --> 51:48.187
Yeah, well, he doesn't have to guarantee
it if he brings the whole plane down.

51:51.358 --> 51:53.484
Listen up. Everybody listen up.

51:54.653 --> 51:57.029
I want a crisis team at LAX, ASAP.

51:57.197 --> 52:00.032
And I need the cargo manifest
for every scrap of freight...

52:00.200 --> 52:03.327
...on South Pacific Air 121.

52:03.495 --> 52:05.246
I can't believe I'm saying this.

52:05.455 --> 52:08.707
I need the best poisonous-snake expert
in this time zone.

52:08.875 --> 52:12.086
And I need him in my ear
or at my side in 20 minutes or less.

52:12.254 --> 52:15.548
Well, come on, people, let's go!
Somebody make that happen for me!

52:15.715 --> 52:18.843
Hey, tell surveillance,
don't let Eddie Kim out of their sight.

52:21.096 --> 52:23.597
All right, we have to suck out the poison.

52:23.765 --> 52:26.350
- Man, I ain't sucking nothing.
- Okay, I'll do it.

52:26.518 --> 52:30.729
What? Oh, there'll be no sucking.
Troy, get this man away from my ass!

52:30.897 --> 52:32.314
- Are you sure?
- We sure. Thanks, pal.

52:32.607 --> 52:34.358
Okay, sweetheart, it's gonna be okay.

52:34.526 --> 52:36.235
Oh, my God!

52:40.782 --> 52:42.575
Hold my baby, please.

52:42.742 --> 52:44.451
Forget about that.

52:44.619 --> 52:46.620
Do you have any
olive oil on the plane?

52:46.788 --> 52:48.581
- Olive oil? Olive oil.
- Yeah.

52:48.748 --> 52:51.375
- I'm on it. Okay.
- Yeah, in a cup!

52:51.543 --> 52:54.253
When I was a kid,
whenever we went hiking...

52:54.421 --> 52:58.090
...we always carried olive oil and
a razor blade in case of a snake bite.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.092
I need something to cut.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.719
Here you go.

53:02.888 --> 53:06.557
Okay, this... This will work, yeah.

53:09.269 --> 53:12.104
Okay, oil.
So you swish it in your mouth...

53:12.272 --> 53:15.566
...to seal it from the poison.

53:18.278 --> 53:20.237
- Look at Claire, Tommy.
- Look at me, sweetie.

53:20.405 --> 53:22.281
It's gonna hurt a little bit, okay?

53:23.033 --> 53:25.326
- Okay, now.
- It hurts.

53:27.537 --> 53:28.662
You're so brave.

53:30.457 --> 53:32.958
Yeah, it's gonna
be all right, Tommy.

53:43.094 --> 53:45.137
That's what I'm talking about.

53:46.765 --> 53:49.642
Good boy.
- Yeah, I think I got it all.

53:49.809 --> 53:52.478
It's gonna be okay, Tommy.
You're very, very brave.

53:53.855 --> 53:56.148
I got bit too.

54:08.161 --> 54:10.079
- Flynn, what the hell...?
- Just sit tight.

54:10.497 --> 54:11.830
I can't...

54:12.165 --> 54:14.166
Do you remember the first thing
I said to you?

54:14.334 --> 54:16.835
- Yes.
- What was it?

54:17.003 --> 54:20.547
- I know, but things have changed.
- What was the first thing I said to you?

54:20.715 --> 54:23.467
Things have changed!
You have a whole plane full of sna...

54:23.635 --> 54:26.804
- God! "Do as I say, you live. "
- Nothing's changed.

54:26.972 --> 54:29.223
Now, I need you to stay
up here by the air phone.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.809
When Agent Harris calls,
you come and get me.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.310
You got it?

54:34.896 --> 54:36.605
Got it.

54:41.152 --> 54:44.405
Hey, hey, hey! They're getting through
the luggage, here, seriously.

54:44.572 --> 54:46.657
I need some help!

54:48.702 --> 54:50.119
Fire extinguisher!

55:02.215 --> 55:04.717
- Ken!
Agent Flynn, here.

55:07.220 --> 55:10.055
Weapons. We have to have weapons.
Where's the silverware?

55:10.223 --> 55:11.765
Well, we have any silverware.

55:11.933 --> 55:13.851
All we have is this.

55:14.686 --> 55:17.187
- Sporks?
- Yeah.

55:18.690 --> 55:19.982
Here.

55:22.193 --> 55:23.360
Use that.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.781
His name is Dr. Stephen Price.

55:27.949 --> 55:30.868
He's some kind of
hardcore snake specialist.

55:31.745 --> 55:33.912
And customs uses him
as their go-to guy...

55:34.080 --> 55:36.749
...for any animal smuggling cases.

55:36.916 --> 55:40.252
- The go-to guy?
- Yeah. So he must be good.

55:52.474 --> 55:53.932
Dr. Price?

55:54.100 --> 55:55.934
- It is I.
- Hank Harris.

55:56.102 --> 55:59.063
I'm hoping this is important,
I've got baby Antiguan racer eggs...

55:59.230 --> 56:01.774
...in there ready to hatch.
First time ever in captivity.

56:01.941 --> 56:03.025
- Really?
- Very exciting.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.402
I got another exciting first
I'd like to tell you about.

56:06.696 --> 56:09.448
I need another!
Help, somebody!

56:10.742 --> 56:12.159
Come on!
Help me out here!

56:12.327 --> 56:14.620
- Please, I can't do this!
- Hold on, I'm coming!

56:14.788 --> 56:16.622
Somebody get me another
fire extinguisher!

56:19.125 --> 56:20.959
All right, we got
less than 90 minutes.

56:21.127 --> 56:24.505
We've already lost over 50 people
and that's including an FBI agent.

56:24.714 --> 56:26.131
Okay.

56:26.299 --> 56:29.301
- We've already contacted local ERs.
- Oh, local ERs.

56:29.469 --> 56:32.805
I don't think you understand
the magnitude...

56:32.972 --> 56:35.474
...of what you're dealing with here.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.643
L.A County ERs can, at best...

56:37.811 --> 56:40.312
...handle the occasional snake bite.

56:40.480 --> 56:44.650
Not an entire 747 full of them.

56:44.818 --> 56:47.528
I'm going to contact
the National Poison Control Center...

56:47.737 --> 56:50.781
...to have them alert every ER
in the tri-county area...

56:50.949 --> 56:55.035
...and to order every available helicopter
crew to be ready.

56:55.245 --> 56:58.831
We've got less than
two hours to mobilize an entire army.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.042
Flynn, Flynn!

57:02.252 --> 57:04.503
Hey, they got
a snake guy on the phone.

57:05.171 --> 57:07.005
Who the hell is that?

57:07.173 --> 57:09.007
His name is Dr. Price.

57:11.761 --> 57:14.555
Look, doc, people are dying
up here. We need help fast.

57:14.764 --> 57:17.724
Okay, just break open any blisters
that form around the bites.

57:17.892 --> 57:19.852
- Keep them clean.
- We're doing that.

57:20.019 --> 57:23.021
- It doesn't seem to be doing much good.
- Snakes don't attack...

57:23.189 --> 57:25.232
...unless they're provoked, right?

57:25.400 --> 57:27.526
Something up there
is making them go crazy.

57:27.819 --> 57:31.572
Yeah, no shit. They're attacking
everybody and everything up here.

57:31.781 --> 57:33.907
They're especially fond
of those fucking leis.

57:34.075 --> 57:36.160
Leis? Jesus, I don't know...

57:36.327 --> 57:38.495
It could possibly be a pheromone.

57:38.663 --> 57:41.582
That's what female animals release
to trigger mating behavior.

57:41.791 --> 57:44.418
It could also provoke
serious hyperaggression.

57:44.586 --> 57:46.670
Like some kind of drug.

57:46.838 --> 57:48.380
Well, that's good news.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.215
Snakes on crack.

57:51.050 --> 57:53.385
How could you imbeciles
let somebody put snakes...

57:53.553 --> 57:56.388
- We need to get them to a hospital.
- We're almost to L.A. now.

57:56.556 --> 57:58.932
Know what they call that?
The point of no return.

57:59.100 --> 58:00.934
So this is it?
That's what the plan is?

58:01.102 --> 58:03.604
We sit around here waiting
for the snakes to bite us?

58:03.813 --> 58:06.023
Look, everyone just calm down, please!

58:06.191 --> 58:07.858
We're doing the best we can here.

58:08.026 --> 58:10.402
Okay, there are hundreds
of species of snakes...

58:10.570 --> 58:14.239
...with hundreds of cocktails of venom.
Some will kill you in two minutes...

58:14.407 --> 58:18.243
...others in two hours and some you can
actually cure with a good night's rest.

58:18.411 --> 58:21.747
But here's the thing,
if you administer the wrong antivenom...

58:21.915 --> 58:23.749
...that will kill you.

58:23.917 --> 58:26.084
I am not a zoologist, man.

58:26.252 --> 58:29.254
I can identify maybe
two of the snakes I've seen up here.

58:29.422 --> 58:30.964
A cobra
and a rattlesnake, okay?

58:31.132 --> 58:35.260
You're going to have to be more...
Much more specific than that.

58:35.428 --> 58:36.887
Oh, shit.

58:37.055 --> 58:38.555
Look...

58:38.723 --> 58:41.433
I'll round up all the dead ones
I can find...

58:41.601 --> 58:43.393
...and I'll call you back, okay?

58:43.561 --> 58:45.103
Make it fast. Time is tissue.

58:45.271 --> 58:47.981
Time is t...

58:49.943 --> 58:51.401
I want to know what's going on.

58:51.569 --> 58:53.278
- Get out of the way!
- No, no! No!

58:53.446 --> 58:55.113
You guys are not
supposed to go up there.

58:55.281 --> 58:57.115
Move, girl!
You can't...!

59:03.289 --> 59:04.623
You can't keep us down there.

59:04.791 --> 59:06.458
Why exactly are there
snakes on this plane?

59:06.626 --> 59:09.503
- I don't have time to explain.
You better make time. We're at risk.

59:09.671 --> 59:10.796
You're gonna tell us why.

59:10.964 --> 59:14.007
What I'm gonna tell you
is to go back downstairs now.

59:14.175 --> 59:17.094
- Man, who the hell you think you are?
- Whoa, whoa. Okay, look.

59:17.262 --> 59:19.137
The snakes are on the plane because...

59:19.305 --> 59:22.349
...I'm supposed to testify
tomorrow against Eddie Kim.

59:22.517 --> 59:24.101
Oh, Jesus Christ, we're all dead.

59:24.477 --> 59:26.144
Not me.

59:26.312 --> 59:28.647
It's my job to handle
life-and-death situations...

59:28.815 --> 59:31.858
...on a daily basis. It's what I do,
and I'm very good at it.

59:32.026 --> 59:34.444
You can stand there
and be the panicked, angry mob...

59:34.612 --> 59:38.115
...and blame him, me and the
government for getting you into this.

59:38.283 --> 59:41.535
But if you want to survive tonight,
you need to save your energy...

59:41.703 --> 59:43.787
...and start working together.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.497
Now, what we need to do...

59:45.665 --> 59:48.625
...is go back in there and find
all the dead snakes we can...

59:48.793 --> 59:52.379
...so the doctors on the ground will know
what kind of antivenoms we need.

59:52.547 --> 59:55.257
Whatever you find, you bring it to me.

59:55.425 --> 59:57.342
And I don't need to tell you
to be careful.

01:00:01.472 --> 01:00:03.515
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
- I'm going with.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:05.559
I can't just sit here doing nothing.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:08.312
Remember when you said
it's all about choices we make?

01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:11.857
- Well, I'm making one. I'm not a prisoner.
- I need you to stay up here.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:14.985
- Why?
- Because if you die...

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.195
...then all this was for nothing.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.367
- Sit your ass down.
We got a snake, man.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.605
Okay, doc, I got one here that's...

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:55.692
...I guess, brownish on top and I'd say
green on the bottom.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.778
Wait a second, pure green?
Or blue?

01:00:57.987 --> 01:01:00.113
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say green.

01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:02.199
No, no, teal.
It's a deep shade of teal.

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:03.950
It's teal, doc.

01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:05.577
Why don't we just take a picture?

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:08.747
Sure, let's drop it off at Jiffy Photo
when we land, Einstein.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.415
Ever heard of e-mail, dick-wad?

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:13.669
- We need a digital camera and a computer.
Or this.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.087
It's got both.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:18.382
Doc, I'm gonna e-mail you
some pictures, all right?

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.891
Rick!

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.269
Rick?

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:36.942
Rick!

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.528
Rick!

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.742
Oh, God.

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:02.676
Are we landing?

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:06.430
- There are no lights down there.
- I don't think so.

01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:08.432
Doc, photos are coming to you now.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.480
Everybody, buckle up now! Now!

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.691
Oh, my God, no!

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:25.490
- Come on, buckle up. I got you.
- Oh, my God!

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:53.226
Fucker!

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.189
Come on!

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.986
Okay, let's pull this thing up.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:05.906
MAN I Hula 121 heavy,
you're descending through 23,0000 feet.

01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:08.366
There's no time to strap in,
just pull up, hard!

01:03:08.534 --> 01:03:12.662
Somebody help me!
Somebody help, they're coming through.

01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:19.377
Tiffany! Tiffany!

01:03:20.713 --> 01:03:22.380
Look out!

01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:25.717
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:32.057
We gotta get the people upstairs.
It's safer there.

01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:38.855
Somebody help me.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.403
Hula one-two-one, heavy...

01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:48.448
...you're now below 19,000 feet.
Do you copy?

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.408
It's not working.

01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:53.745
- I wanna get out.
- Let me get you up.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:56.414
Get upstairs, come on.

01:03:58.042 --> 01:03:59.292
Go!

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:01.920
Go, go, go!

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:09.469
Hula one-two-one, heavy,
pull up. Pull up.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.509
Out of the way!
Move your ass, Goddamn it!

01:04:57.476 --> 01:04:59.519
Go, go!

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.317
No.

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.656
Come on, quicker!

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:13.658
Come on!
Move it!

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.621
Hurry!

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.834
Hang on to me. I've got you!

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.678
Get me off this plane!

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:44.940
Come on!

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.151
Get back!

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.986
Go, quick! Move!

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:11.883
Oh, shit!

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.468
Mary Kate!

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.680
You animal! You animal!

01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:19.224
- I hate you!
- Freaking dog, lady.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.059
- I hate you!
Why did you do that?

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.687
What? You all would've
done exactly the same thing.

01:06:28.442 --> 01:06:30.443
Somebody do something.

01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:33.238
Look out! Oh, my God!

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.972
Let's go. Hey, hey, in back of you!

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.473
- Behind you.
- Come on!

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:06.771
Come on, move, move, move!
Get him up, get him up!

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.738
We gotta block the stairs.
Grab bags, everyone.

01:07:14.905 --> 01:07:16.614
- Come on!
- Pass it down!

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.996
Get me NTSB.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:25.790
And call the Coast Guard.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:31.838
Hula one-two-one, heavy,
you are now below 1000 feet. Pull up.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:33.673
Pull up!

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:46.144
Oh, my God.

01:07:47.271 --> 01:07:49.439
Holy fuck.

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:53.526
Oh, thank God.

01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:56.988
Wait a second.
What about the life raft?

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.656
- Use this!
- Good idea.

01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:00.533
I got it!

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:05.997
Hello, can anybody hear me?

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:10.126
Hula one-two-one, heavy, somebody
wanna tell me what's going on up there?

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:12.337
We've lost our...

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:17.216
Rick.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.685
It's not fully inflated yet!

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:33.024
Here, grab an end!

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:35.693
Oh, Rick.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.830
Hold it, hold it down.
Push it down.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:51.209
That's great, okay. Get it down.
There you go. There you go.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:52.877
Don't let anybody down.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:56.214
Oh, Rick, your arm.

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:00.176
Okay.

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:02.720
There you go.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:06.224
Oh, yeah, you know, Claire,
I think I'm gonna need your shirt too.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:09.560
Oh, jeez. Very funny.
Gotta try, right?

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:13.231
Rick, could you please
engage the autopilot?

01:09:13.732 --> 01:09:16.151
Yeah, here, I got it.

01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:24.033
Do you think you can fly with one hand?

01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:28.705
Oh, baby, you'd be amazed at what
a man can do with one hand.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.582
All right, I got this. You go get.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:33.001
Do your business.

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:49.100
We had no choice.
The snakes were everywhere.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:52.060
Yeah, okay, I guess you did
what you had to do.

01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:57.108
These aren't North American snakes.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.903
What does it matter?
Let's just get the antivenom...

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:03.239
...and take it to the airport.
- No, these snakes aren't even...

01:10:03.407 --> 01:10:05.825
...from this continent.
They're from all over the globe.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:09.120
Only a handful of U.S. Hospitals
even carry foreign antivenom. Uh...

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.957
- How long?
- How long what?

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:17.795
- How long to get the antivenom here?
- I don't know. A day, maybe two.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:19.422
What do we do?

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.091
I don't know
if there's anything we can do.

01:10:28.807 --> 01:10:31.059
What are you drawing there, sweetie?

01:10:33.687 --> 01:10:36.981
Oh, wow, that's really good.

01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:41.903
I'm really sorry about your dog.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:44.864
Thanks.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.451
What's up, buddy?

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:53.706
Trying to get this guy to slam
the basketball. He just won't do it.

01:10:53.874 --> 01:10:57.835
Last month they offered
early retirement.

01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:01.297
But no...

01:11:01.465 --> 01:11:04.717
...this broad needed
one more tour of duty.

01:11:04.885 --> 01:11:07.387
You were here for a reason.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.056
You saved my baby.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.600
That's a pretty good reason.

01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:20.358
Hey, it's too...
Flynn, it's too hot.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:22.527
I'm from Tennessee. I hadn't noticed.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:26.406
- Anyway, heat's the least of our worries.
- No, no, no, listen, listen.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.533
The air's not recycling.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:33.329
He's right. If there's no air conditioning,
it's gonna get too hard to breathe.

01:11:33.497 --> 01:11:34.914
Shit!

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:37.583
Okay, how about the zoos?

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:40.336
How about the zoos?
I mean, zoos got snakes, right?

01:11:40.504 --> 01:11:42.046
So they must have antivenom there.

01:11:42.214 --> 01:11:46.092
We would need a detailed list of every
species involved with that exact number.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.555
And an exotic shipment like this would
only come through a dealer. So...

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.890
All right, well, who in Hawaii
would do that?

01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:55.935
No one in Hawaii, because snakes
aren't indigenous to Hawaii.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.896
But Eddie Kim lives in L.A.

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:01.733
Could he have shopped locally?

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:05.945
Yes, only one guy could arrange
this many illegal snakes.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:09.699
- He lives out in the desert.
- Take us to the heliport.

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:12.827
You don't think I know
it's hotter than hell in here?

01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:18.666
We also have abnormal
vibrations in engines one and two.

01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:21.210
I had no choice but to throttle back.

01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:23.421
- You slowed down?
- Yeah.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.089
Well, you know.

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:28.593
- It's that or option B.
- Which is?

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.763
I go faster and the engines seize up.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:35.767
We eventually
plummet to a horrible death.

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:39.437
They spend the next year
identifying femurs.

01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:44.233
Okay, so just tell me
how to get the AC back on.

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:47.779
We've lost power
to the outflow valve motor.

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:52.283
- Which is where?
- Well, you gotta reset it manually.

01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:56.454
The breaker's down in the cargo hold.

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:58.289
Yeah.

01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:00.583
Sucks to be you right now.

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.628
Get off me, man!

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.297
I told y'all to stop touching on me
and coughing on me.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:09.425
It's disgusting up in here.
Stay away from me.

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.389
How come there's no air
coming out of this piece of junk?

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:17.100
- How come there's no air?
- Only lasts about 10 minutes...

01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:18.643
...after they deploy. Please...

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:22.105
- Please nothing. Get out of my face.
- If you could take a seat...

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:26.984
You sit down. Back away from me.
Get up off me, man. Back up off me.

01:13:27.152 --> 01:13:28.486
Hey, hey, hey.

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:30.113
I gotta get off this plane.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.824
- I'm sick of this bullshit.
- Listen, you got to chill.

01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:35.701
- Look, just get a grip, all right?
- You get a grip, man.

01:13:35.869 --> 01:13:38.454
Hey, back up, back up. Back up!

01:13:38.622 --> 01:13:41.499
That gun goes off
in this pressurized cabin, we all die.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:42.834
You know what? I want air.

01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:45.670
- What's the matter with you, Clarence?
- What's the matter with you?

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:48.506
What's the matter
with you, man? Hey, look.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:51.551
You know we go back
to when we were kids, all right?

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.511
But I don't even recognize you now.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.472
Waving a gun at all these
innocent women and children.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.808
Man, there's a baby
right over there, man.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:02.520
We're all in trouble here, dawg.
This ain't just about you.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.981
Sit your ass down, Clarence.

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:07.775
Whatever, man.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.784
It's the snakes!
- Shoot. Now what?

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.705
Breathe deep.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.794
Oh, God, Grace.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:07.627
Claire.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.672
Claire.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.269
I need you to be strong.

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:32.068
Come on.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:35.571
- Let's go get these people some air.
- Okay.

01:15:57.302 --> 01:15:59.971
See this?

01:16:00.138 --> 01:16:02.640
I went through
a pyromaniac phase as a kid.

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:05.309
- Here.
- You too, huh?

01:16:05.477 --> 01:16:07.270
Anything else I should know about you?

01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:10.356
Let me go with you. You don't know
your way around down there.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:13.150
No, I need you up here.
You're my eyes and ears.

01:16:13.318 --> 01:16:15.278
Call me.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:17.488
Be back soon as I can.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:21.826
- You'd better. Be careful.
- Yeah.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.012
Okay, I'm here.

01:16:41.179 --> 01:16:44.015
Okay, the EAP panel
should be on your right.

01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:15.838
Okay, here I go.

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:52.249
Hey, how's your boy?

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:55.086
I don't know, man.
He's in a lot of pain.

01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:59.799
- Here, man, take some of this water.
- Thank you.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.302
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.430
- Hey, you got any water?
- Sure, yeah.

01:18:06.598 --> 01:18:08.391
Thanks.

01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:11.394
Look, I'm not really good at this whole
apologizing thing...

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:13.938
...but I'm sorry about pushing you.

01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:16.065
It's all right.

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.776
You too, man.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.945
That's my bad.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.781
Okay, it's okay.

01:18:36.628 --> 01:18:38.504
Oh.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:43.259
Looks like somebody
rigged this access panel door...

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.928
...to stay open
so the snakes could get out.

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:47.805
Be careful.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:52.351
All right, so where's this outflow
breaker panel you were talking about?

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.687
Oh, it's in the very next compartment.

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.504
Shit!

01:19:20.672 --> 01:19:24.425
- What's going on?
- The goddamn lever's stuck.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.177
Ooh!

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:46.197
- Flynn, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:22.566
Yes!

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:26.570
Okay, well, that's a good sign.

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:30.783
Shh.

01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:33.744
Do you guys hear that?

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:15.661
Kreitler's been busted twice
by customs...

01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:19.290
...for possession of illegal snakes.
There he is. That's him.

01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:24.962
Down, down!

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.132
Get the door.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.968
- What are you doing?
- My job.

01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:22.811
Area's secure. Send in Dr. Price now.

01:22:26.816 --> 01:22:29.693
Wow, that's gonna leave a mark.

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:34.239
That's a desert blacksnake.

01:22:34.407 --> 01:22:37.660
That's indigenous to the Middle East.

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:41.872
- Looks like you can use some antivenom.
- In the fridge. Hurry.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.707
Oh, hurry.

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:46.543
The Middle East.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Price...

01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:48.921
...but that would make
that snake illegal, right?

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:50.214
Yes, it would.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.800
How long does that give
Mr. Mullet here to live?

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:56.720
I would say about seven minutes.

01:22:56.888 --> 01:22:59.556
Seven minutes, huh?
All right, listen to me.

01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:02.768
Hey, I would love
to do this whole dance, you know...

01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:05.187
...take a nuanced approach
to interrogating but...

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:09.566
...I don't have time to be subtle. I want
a list of every snake on that plane.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.902
You got less than seven minutes.

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:14.238
On the clipboard.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.782
- The clipboard!
- Hang on to that.

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:21.745
- Is that every snake on that plane?
- Yes.

01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:23.789
- Did Eddie Kim pay you to do this?
- Yes!

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:25.916
Look, give me the shot, goddamn it.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:27.710
What are you gonna do,
call the ACLU?

01:23:27.877 --> 01:23:30.629
How'd you get them to be so aggressive?
That's what I wonder.

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:33.632
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Hey.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.093
You're wasting it!

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.762
Pheromones. We sprayed
the flowers with it...

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:41.432
...so it would circulate
in the plane's air system.

01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:44.393
I swear to God. That's it.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.070
Okay. All right.

01:23:57.907 --> 01:24:00.617
Bring in Kim. Charge him
with multiple counts of murder...

01:24:00.785 --> 01:24:04.288
...and attempted murder and get that
piece-of-shit attorney on the phone.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:08.125
Yeah, tell him to ask Kim what his
preference is. Gas or lethal injection.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:20.137
Oh, thank God.

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:24.892
Flynn, it's Harris.

01:24:30.648 --> 01:24:33.942
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:38.113
Outstanding. All right.

01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:41.158
Everybody, listen,
they have the antivenom.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.869
It's gonna be waiting
for us when we land in L.A.

01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:47.748
Hear that, little man?
Your brother's gonna be fine.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:51.001
It's all up to the pilot now.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:53.504
I'll go give him the good news.

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:56.840
Rick. Rick.

01:24:58.051 --> 01:25:00.344
Rick, open the door.

01:25:01.554 --> 01:25:04.640
What's going on?
- He's not answering.

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:07.851
Rick!

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:20.531
Oh, my God!

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.743
Get him up!

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:36.088
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:39.925
Is there anyone here
who knows how to fly a plane?

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:44.388
Claire, I'll do it. I'm sure
the tower can talk me through it.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:47.891
No, no, no, Flynn.
I know who could land this plane.

01:25:48.059 --> 01:25:49.977
- Who?
- Him.

01:25:51.729 --> 01:25:53.063
Yeah, you. Come on, Troy.

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:55.274
You know you can do this, man.

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:59.069
- Come on, take us home, dawg.
- You know how to fly?

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:03.615
Hey, man, I got over 2000 hours.

01:26:03.783 --> 01:26:05.909
This is all you've talked about.

01:26:06.077 --> 01:26:08.537
Troy, you can do this.

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:10.205
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:10.373 --> 01:26:12.082
Yeah, I can do this.

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:15.544
We gotta clear the snakes
out of the cockpit.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:18.589
Yeah, yeah, clear the snakes
out of the cockpit, yeah.

01:26:18.756 --> 01:26:20.591
Enough is enough!

01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:23.302
I have had it with these
motherfucking snakes...

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.637
...on this motherfucking plane!

01:26:25.805 --> 01:26:27.639
Everybody strap in.

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:30.976
I'm about to open some fucking windows.

01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:50.037
Take this. Tie it to the cockpit door.

01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:53.790
Let's go.

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:11.099
When the windows go out,
the cabin's gonna lose pressure...

01:27:11.267 --> 01:27:13.227
...and oxygen.
You gotta get us down fast.

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:17.356
All right, everybody make sure you're
strapped in as securely as possible.

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:21.151
Remember, it's going to be loud
and it's going to be cold.

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:24.279
Hold your breath
as long as you can, all right?

01:27:24.447 --> 01:27:26.657
And protect your head.
Use your arms.

01:27:26.824 --> 01:27:29.493
Is everybody ready?
Ready to do this?

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:33.664
- Let's do it.
- All right, take the position.

01:27:35.833 --> 01:27:39.878
One, two, three.

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:01.608
Do it now!

01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:16.498
Let's go!

01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:40.856
Hit that autopilot switch for me.

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.111
Ooh! Whoo!

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.405
That's what I'm talking about, boy!

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:50.657
This shit is bananas!

01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:13.764
Hold on!
Hold on!

01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:19.561
Come on, baby!

01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:23.482
Come on, push.

01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.920
Yeah, right about there.

01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:46.922
Okay, we're leveling out.

01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:53.261
You okay?

01:29:59.018 --> 01:30:01.311
Troy, the plane's not level.
It's not level!

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:05.232
Yeah, yeah, I know that the plane
is not level, okay? Okay?

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:07.901
Give me a break, man.

01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:14.366
All right, what's up? What's up,
y'all? What it is. What it is!

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:17.869
This is your new pilot Troy speaking,
and sitting next to me...

01:30:18.037 --> 01:30:20.705
...is my main man,
my brother from another mother...

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:24.292
...the biggest pimp that I know,
Superfly Agent Flynn.

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.169
Ladies and gentlemen,
Agent Flynn.

01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:34.177
Sir, have you got any experience
piloting a jet aircraft?

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:36.847
Oh, yeah, F-15s, F-16s...

01:30:37.014 --> 01:30:39.391
...A- 10 Warthogs,
I've flown all that shit.

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.518
Then we're all thankful
to have you, sir.

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:44.980
- What squadron were you with?
- The Awesome Fighting Aces.

01:30:45.148 --> 01:30:48.859
Man, I'm telling you, them video gamers
got their shit locked down tight.

01:30:49.026 --> 01:30:52.696
Sir, are you telling me
that your only real flight time...

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.865
...is at the controls of a video game?

01:30:55.950 --> 01:31:00.120
No, see, it's not a video game, all right?
It's a flight simulator.

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:03.665
- Is that a PlayStation or Xbox?
- PlayStation 2.

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:06.710
Man, it's got an introduction
by Chuck Yeager and everything.

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:09.421
Look, Flynn, man, I can do this.

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:11.131
Trust me.

01:31:12.341 --> 01:31:14.217
Look, LAX,
just give me my VOR numbers...

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:16.386
...and my approach vectors,
and I'll be fine.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:20.182
Sir, I suggest you relinquish
the pilot's chair...

01:31:20.349 --> 01:31:22.434
...to someone more experienced.

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:24.895
This is Agent Neville Flynn, FBI.

01:31:25.062 --> 01:31:27.230
You are talking to
the only person up here...

01:31:27.398 --> 01:31:30.525
...who has that experience.
I suggest you give him what he needs...

01:31:30.693 --> 01:31:32.194
...so we can land this thing.

01:31:37.241 --> 01:31:40.202
So, uh, you are
pretty good at this game, right?

01:31:40.369 --> 01:31:42.537
Yes, man. No problem.

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:46.917
Well, I mean, my older brother Randy
has got the high score but I'm good.

01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:50.754
Asshole. Never lets me
hear the end of it.

01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:52.756
LAX tower, this is Hula 1-2-1.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:56.468
Requesting clearance for landing.
Please advise which runway.

01:31:56.636 --> 01:32:00.096
Hula 1-2-1, heavy, we're in the process
of clearing all the runways...

01:32:00.264 --> 01:32:04.267
...but you got a strong tailwind. Advise,
come around and use runway 2-4-left.

01:32:04.435 --> 01:32:06.478
No, negative, tower. I can't do that.

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:08.897
I don't have time
for westbound orientation.

01:32:09.148 --> 01:32:13.068
Look, I got a lot of injured passengers
up here who need help immediately.

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:16.947
You try to land west to east,
you'll come in too fast to control.

01:32:17.114 --> 01:32:19.908
Then I suggest you speed up
clearing the rest of the runways...

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:22.118
...because my ass
is coming in for a landing!

01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:30.627
All right, brace yourselves,
you guys, this is it.

01:32:33.297 --> 01:32:35.257
Everybody brace yourselves!

01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:42.597
Here we go.

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:02.826
Brakes! Brakes, Troy!

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:05.704
- Put your ass in it!
- This part ain't in the game.

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:07.330
Is crashing part of the game?

01:33:07.498 --> 01:33:11.167
I don't know, man. I usually just hit
reset and start the level over.

01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:13.169
Oh, shit, left!

01:33:13.337 --> 01:33:16.881
Left! Turn this big
motherfucker left, Troy!

01:33:49.707 --> 01:33:50.999
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:53.501
All praises to the PlayStation!

01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:55.170
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:57.088
That's my boy, Troy, yes!

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:00.842
Hell, yeah!

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:03.762
Whose house is this?
Troy's house, that's right.

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.930
Fuck Randy!
Fuck Randy and his high score.

01:34:06.098 --> 01:34:08.183
That's my own brother,
and I say, "Fuck him!"

01:34:14.273 --> 01:34:17.025
Man, my ass.

01:34:17.193 --> 01:34:20.362
- My ass, man.
- Okay, let's get going.

01:34:24.283 --> 01:34:26.493
Over here! Got them!

01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:34.084
Okay, everybody.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:02.821
Thank you!

01:35:23.259 --> 01:35:24.634
Hey, doc, thank you.

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:26.970
And hey, good luck with
those Antiguan racers.

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:30.807
- It was nice working with you, agent.
Please help! Help, please!

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:32.851
- This boy is unconscious.
- Keep that close.

01:35:33.018 --> 01:35:35.186
He needs oxygen right away.

01:35:36.939 --> 01:35:39.607
Did anyone see the snake
that bit this boy?

01:35:39.775 --> 01:35:41.818
- Show them, sweetie. It's okay.
What is it?

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:44.154
I couldn't find the snake,
so I drew a picture.

01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:47.115
It's a cobra, right, like Indiana Jones?
Excellent.

01:35:47.283 --> 01:35:50.577
Lactin and Ringer's solution,
25 milliliters. I'll do the antivenom.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.877
Sean.

01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:08.052
Before everything gets crazy out there,
I wanna say thanks.

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.513
Couldn't have done this without you.

01:36:12.516 --> 01:36:14.350
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:36:14.518 --> 01:36:17.020
Let's lock this guy up
who tried to kill us.

01:36:35.706 --> 01:36:37.665
Give him a hand!

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:39.542
Down, down, down.

01:36:47.426 --> 01:36:49.052
I couldn't breathe.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.179
You all right? Come on.
Yeah.

01:36:51.347 --> 01:36:55.183
Come on.
Oh, man.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.563
Nice. Stings like shit, huh?

01:37:01.023 --> 01:37:02.774
Yeah.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.985
This is Agent Harris,
the guy on the other end of the phone.

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.445
It's an honor.

01:37:09.782 --> 01:37:12.742
Kenny, baby. Oh, my God.

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:14.410
Oh, my God!

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:21.125
Oh! Oh, I'm gonna get you home.

01:37:21.293 --> 01:37:24.796
Come on, let's go.
My little cowgirl.

01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:35.431
Claire.

01:37:35.975 --> 01:37:37.684
Hey.

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:42.772
Now that you've saved my life,
I think I kind of owe you a dinner...

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.566
...to show my appreciation.

01:37:45.776 --> 01:37:48.444
Well, I would very much
like to take you up on that.

01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:49.612
Is that right?

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.284
Call me.

01:37:54.994 --> 01:37:56.411
Will do.

01:38:03.168 --> 01:38:06.296
- Sean, hey.
- Hey.

01:38:07.965 --> 01:38:10.592
Oh, damn.

01:38:16.098 --> 01:38:18.099
I'll definitely call you.

01:38:21.937 --> 01:38:23.605
Thank you.

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:28.651
How do you like flying in first class?

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:33.573
Do you remember the first
thing you ever told me?

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:35.867
What the fuck's that got
to do with anything?

01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:38.494
What was the first thing
you ever told me?

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:43.333
"Do as I say and you live. "

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:46.461
Exactly. Now it's your turn.

01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:48.880
Do as I say, and you live.
