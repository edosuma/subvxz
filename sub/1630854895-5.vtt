00:08.508 --> 00:12.012
<i>Four Kildare teens who went missing
nearly six weeks ago</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:16.641
<i>are now reported alive, safe,
and back on Kildare Island.</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:19.185
<i>Now a live update
from the sheriff's department.</i>

00:19.185 --> 00:22.814
<i>Yeah, after six weeks,
the four teens that had been missing</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:26.693
<i>from Kildare County have returned,
been reunited with their families.</i>

00:27.318 --> 00:29.779
<i>We're still waiting for details
about their journey,</i>

00:29.779 --> 00:32.615
<i>but I'm sure
they have quite a tale to tell.</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:35.535
<i>We also got word
that the father of one of the teens,</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:38.455
<i>John B Routledge,
who's been presumed dead for a year now</i>,

00:38.455 --> 00:40.582
<i>has also returned alive and well.</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:41.958
<i>Wonders never cease.</i>

00:43.084 --> 00:45.920
<i>Right now,
we're just trying to get those kids</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:48.048
<i>settled back into school,
with their families.</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:49.841
<i>They've been through a lot.</i>

00:53.011 --> 00:54.971
<i>The teens were down
in the Caribbean</i>

00:54.971 --> 00:57.265
<i>with another Kildare teen, Sarah Cameron,</i>

00:57.265 --> 01:00.185
<i>the daughter
of disgraced real estate magnate,</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:03.271
<i>Ward Cameron, who confessed
to the murder of Sheriff Peterkin</i>

01:03.271 --> 01:04.731
<i>two months ago.</i>

01:04.731 --> 01:08.026
<i>All the teens back,
safe and sound on Kildare Island,</i>

01:08.026 --> 01:10.361
<i>and John Routledge back from the dead.</i>

01:10.361 --> 01:13.114
<i>That's about as good
as a result as we could hope for.</i>

01:13.114 --> 01:16.326
When I went back to Tannyhill,
Rafe was on the phone with Ward,

01:16.326 --> 01:19.329
and he just kept saying,
"My thing, this is my thing."

01:19.329 --> 01:21.831
- He had to be talking about the cross.
- Absolutely.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.293
And he's coming
into Wilmington tonight at eight o'clock.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.421
It's being shipped by train
to Raleigh from there,

01:28.421 --> 01:30.340
but this is our chance to get it back.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.511
- You get any other information?
- Uh, Sarah got the cargo number.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.013
-  Okay, well, that's a start.
-  Yeah.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.224
They're definitely fencing
that shit off as we speak.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.060
- So we should probably get a move on.
- Sarah, you hear from John B?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.854
No, I mean, he's probably
off somewhere with his dad.

01:44.854 --> 01:47.816
- But the problem is they have the Twinkie.
- Our transportation.

01:49.025 --> 01:49.901
Um...

01:49.901 --> 01:52.320
- I could ask Heyward for the truck.
- Uh, what?

01:52.320 --> 01:56.074
- Yeah, that's gonna go well.
- I know, but we have no other options.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.909
Absolutely not!

01:57.909 --> 02:00.328
This might be our last opportunity
to go get that cross.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.288
- Is that so?

02:02.872 --> 02:05.250
- I could just get to the mainland--
- Oh boy.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.793
Pop, please! Come on!

02:06.793 --> 02:09.629
This is about our heritage, our family.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.089
This is our thing.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.551
You wanna know what our thing is?
Doing what we say we're gonna do.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.846
Keeping our promises.
Exceeding expectations.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.931
You used to understand that!

02:19.931 --> 02:21.391
Just...

02:21.975 --> 02:24.269
And I still do! I still understand that.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.437
But, Pop, please,
this is the last opportunity,

02:26.437 --> 02:30.275
and I won't ask you for anything else,
and I promise you, I'm done, I swear.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.069
- Please, please let me do this. Mama.
- Uh-uh.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.573
- You on board with this?
- Gotta strike while the iron's hot.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.949
Get off my counter!

02:38.908 --> 02:40.910
Pop, I know appearances
are against me right now,

02:40.910 --> 02:43.621
but please, I will do anything I have to.
I'll work triple shifts.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.998
I'll never leave the house again.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.667
Just please let me go
to Wilmington with your truck.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.966
Get out of here.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.887
Before your mama talk some sense into me,
but you can't take my truck.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.682
- Pop, we're going to need transportation.
- That is not my problem.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.227
I got deliveries.
Somebody's got to keep the lights on.

03:06.811 --> 03:10.064
You know?
Just in case you don't make it big.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.816
All right. Thank you so much.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.193
- Yeah.
- I won't let you down.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.570
- Appreciate you, Pop.
- Don't break any laws.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.698
- Try to keep him out of trouble!
- I'll try!

03:18.698 --> 03:21.451
<i>- ♪ I know a man, he's a powerful man ♪</i>

03:21.451 --> 03:24.370
<i>♪ Got the people in his power

03:28.958 --> 03:30.668
<i>- ♪ He started at the bottom-- ♪

03:30.668 --> 03:33.213
- Here we are. Gunning for the big prize.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.716
See, the idol,
it has the directions to El Dorado on it.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.718
The diary should lead us
to the other half,

03:38.718 --> 03:40.386
which is why Singh wants it so badly.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.971
But we got the jump on him this time.

03:41.971 --> 03:45.850
If we put the whole thing together,
both halves, and decipher it,

03:47.185 --> 03:49.187
mountain of gold, here we come.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.982
- Let's go find this church.
- Mountain of gold, huh?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.903
So we're looking for 17 Society Street.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.698
Uh, it should be
an old church with a graveyard.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.661
- Uh, 17, you said?
-  Catholic church...

04:04.661 --> 04:07.163
- Seventeen Society Street. That's it.
- Seventeen.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.457
- No, no, no, no.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.292
- This can't be right.
- Right, right.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.462
Because we've been right so many times.
Why would we be wrong now, Dad?

04:14.462 --> 04:16.881
Don't get smart with me.
I don't need that right now, boy.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.841
This doesn't make any sense.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.470
This should be a church and a graveyard,
not a damn Thai restaurant.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.974
Maybe it's numbered wrong. It can't be.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.435
Hey, great explorer?

04:30.770 --> 04:31.854
Check it out.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.191
"Stood until
the Great Earthquake of 1886."

04:35.191 --> 04:36.776
Charleston Museum?

04:38.653 --> 04:41.990
Well, I'll be damned.
You are good for something, son.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.659
Charleston Museum, eh?

04:45.535 --> 04:46.536
Plan B.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.457
Honey, I am listening to you.
I'm just having a hard time.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.085
So I need you
to walk me through it one more time.

04:54.085 --> 04:57.463
- The Cross of Santo Domingo that we found.
- Right.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.132
We thought it was gone forever.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.552
We just find out
it's... it's gonna be in Wilmington tonight.

05:02.552 --> 05:06.264
- Okay. And the cross is Pope's family--
- Pope's family heirloom.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.641
- Okay.
- Priceless historical artifact.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.060
Priceless,
which you're telling me that you found?

05:11.060 --> 05:13.771
We found it,
and then Rafe and Ward stole it from us.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.482
- Wait, do you know how insane you sound?
- Baby.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.734
- Ward is dead.
- He's not dead.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.652
We've been over this part a million times!

05:19.652 --> 05:21.904
You understand that
this is hard to follow, right?

05:21.904 --> 05:23.489
I mean, we had a funeral for the man.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.366
I get how it sounds, but he's alive.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.286
I wish he wasn't, but he is.
Why would I lie?

05:28.286 --> 05:29.412
He's alive.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.081
- JJ?
- Yeah?

05:33.082 --> 05:34.292
A little help?

05:36.252 --> 05:38.463
- Ward's alive in the Caribbean.
-  Yes.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.133
He's living off the loot
that he stole from us, and, uh,

05:42.133 --> 05:44.218
yeah, he's flying across to Wilmington.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.595
Give me a break, man.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.431
You're right. What do I know, though?
Just saw with my own two eyes.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.476
- So did Kiara, but whatever.
- I'm skeptical, okay?

05:51.476 --> 05:54.604
I am skeptical, JJ,
as in "I think it's all bullshit."

05:54.604 --> 05:56.522
I think you've been led astray, Kiara.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.690
- And you, JJ--
- Mike.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.193
- Let's get this out in the open.
- Can we take it down a little?

06:00.193 --> 06:03.988
Let me tell you something.
You need to understand that I do get it.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.075
- Sure, you do. Yeah. Sure. Sure do.
-  Do you hear me? I do.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.535
I like you, JJ, and I bet
you're fricking fun to hang with,

06:09.535 --> 06:14.832
ditch school with, go down to the break,
because I was once just like you, bro.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.667
I didn't think that anything mattered.

06:16.667 --> 06:20.338
Thought I could make up any bullshit story
and these stupid Kooks would believe it.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.255
Mom.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.425
But then I learned about hard work

06:24.425 --> 06:26.344
and about what really mattered.

06:26.344 --> 06:30.515
All I care about,
<i>all</i> that I care about is my daughter.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.350
That's it.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.729
And all that I know is
that she was a lot better off

06:37.355 --> 06:38.898
before she met you and your friends.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.692
-  Dad, I was never better off!
-  Yes, you were.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.111
- Please.
- I was miserable.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.947
- Miserable? No, no.
-  Take it down a notch. Listen.

06:45.947 --> 06:50.034
No, these Pogues
have ruined my daughter's life.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.121
Didn't mean any disrespect, Mr. Carrera.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.500
- Y'all have a good day.
- Yeah.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.335
Lovely home.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.130
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing? Protecting my daughter.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.506
- Can we please--
- Wait a second.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.384
Everybody says it,
that he's a liar and a thief.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.428
- He's just like his father.
-  Don't go there.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.471
Please don't bring him into this.

07:10.471 --> 07:13.141
-  Don't bring him into this?
-  He's nothing like his dad.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.977
- Nothing like his dad. You don't know him.
-  I don't him?

07:15.977 --> 07:18.813
-  They're nothing alike.
-  I know you. Where are you going?

07:18.813 --> 07:21.274
I listened to you guys.
Y'all can listen to me.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.568
This isn't fair. No, I listened to you.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.778
- This isn't fair?
- Y'all were supposed to listen to me.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.781
Please just wait. Please wait.
Just wait one second, please.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.992
I promised myself
if I had a second chance,

07:30.992 --> 07:33.327
I'd try and be different,
and I'm trying to be different.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.745
Okay, I got to go.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.665
I want you take this.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.418
There's a credit card on the back.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.044
If you get into trouble,

07:43.087 --> 07:45.089
if you need help, you call me.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.300
I will.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.218
I will, Mom.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.804
- I love you. I gotta go. I'll be back.
- Okay.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.265
- I love you. Please be careful.
- I'll be back.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.767
Jayj.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.768
I'm sorry.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.314
Jayj, wait.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.443
- My dad's literally the worst.
- It's whatever.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.403
I already know what they think of me.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.282
They think the same about me.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.825
You ready?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.871
- Yeah.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.332

Just follow my lead. Okay, kid?

08:41.562 --> 08:42.563
Hey, sharpen up.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.778
Hello, sir.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.739
I wonder if I could have
a word with your chief of collections.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.659
Dr. Pierce is
out doing fieldwork till June.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.161
- Can I help you with something?
- Well, hopefully.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.997
I'm Dr. Marion from up at USC.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.624
Paleogenetics mostly.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.002
Anyway, I'm interested in seeing
some items you have in your collection.

09:05.002 --> 09:08.381
Specifically pieces retrieved
from the excavation at Trinity Church

09:08.381 --> 09:09.757
back in the 1880s.

09:09.757 --> 09:13.302
You could submit a written request
to get access to the archives.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.179
I was really hoping
to poke around there today.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.931
I got one of my students with me.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.977
They don't let folks down there
after that Egyptologist weaseled in

09:20.977 --> 09:23.771
and proved a bunch
of the Pharaoh collection were fakes.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.398
- I remember that.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.692
You'll have to go through the protocols.

09:27.692 --> 09:31.821
Well, where.... where are the archives?
Are they... are they here on-site?

09:31.821 --> 09:36.158
No, downtown museum storage,
end of Broad Street, uh, near the Battery.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.161
I'd take you, but they won't give me
one of them key cards.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.955
Above my pay grade.

09:40.955 --> 09:44.125
You got to be a director
like Ms. Flannery here.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.752
- Hello, Ms. Flannery.
-  Good afternoon.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.964
-  Key card, huh?

09:49.964 --> 09:51.048
Understood.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.343
All right.
Well, thank you for the information.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.137
You've been most helpful, okay?

09:56.137 --> 09:57.179
Have a good day.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.977
Honestly, the hardest part
is gonna be security, all right?

10:02.977 --> 10:05.313
So most of the guys
are gonna be at the rail yard.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.148
We'll need to find
some place and guard it,

10:07.148 --> 10:09.692
maybe a little further down the line,
like a whistle-stop.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.610
Yeah.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.070
You guys are getting
ahead of yourselves per usual.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.364
We don't have a way
to transport the cross.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.783
What you think? On JJ's motorcycle?

10:17.783 --> 10:19.410
That's not my fault.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.953
Oh, everyone. All right, all me.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.163
Okay, other options.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.124
I was just, uh, surfing the Soup Bowl.
Oh my goodness.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.418
- Oh my God.
-  Oh my God, what?

10:29.337 --> 10:30.546
Is that Topper?

10:31.047 --> 10:33.257
Why... is he everywhere?

10:33.257 --> 10:34.467
Perfect.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.968
- Hey, Jayj.
- What?

10:35.968 --> 10:38.387
I bet you Topper has
a way to transport the cross.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.015
Actually, Pope's right.
He does have a rig.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.350
- No.
- Yes.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.185
- No. Absolutely not.
-  Yes, come on.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.270
Sarah, you already got him
whipped anyway, all right?

10:46.270 --> 10:48.230
So why don't you just take one
for the team?

10:48.230 --> 10:49.857
What would John B say?

10:49.857 --> 10:51.692
I think John B will completely understand.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.278
Think about the circumstances.
It's about treasure.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.821
We can handle John B.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.407
Just talk to him.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.328
So this is your master plan, huh?

11:02.328 --> 11:03.412
Rob an old lady?

11:03.412 --> 11:05.039
Not... rob.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.333
Appropriate, all right?

11:07.875 --> 11:10.169
Temporarily acquire an object
that has no value for her

11:10.169 --> 11:11.545
and is essential for us.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.547
Okay, I just wanna...

11:13.547 --> 11:14.924
Hey, there she is.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.009
It's game time, kid.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.887
- No. What are you doing?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.389
Do you know where we are?

11:21.889 --> 11:23.849
We are on the hot damn Hillary Step,
okay, boy?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.309
One beat away from the mountaintop.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.396
We can't let a little thing
like federal armed robbery get in the way.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.315
- I taught you how to shoplift.
- Are you seriously bringing that up now?

11:31.315 --> 11:33.359
But that came in handy
when I was gone, didn't it?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.694
Oh Jesus. Come on, man.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.280
So here's another little lesson.
A little baby step.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.913
J-bird, hey, you gotta
let that thing go out there at sea, kid.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.415
Lighten up a little.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.500
It was us or them.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.378
What did you want me to do?

11:52.878 --> 11:56.090
And right now,
we got another thing that needs doing.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.679
- I think it's better if you do it.
- Oh, me. You want me to go, your son?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.597
- To go hold up that old lady?
- That's right.

12:03.597 --> 12:07.268
I assure you, once we get to Orinoco,
it will get harder.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.185
Look.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.313
- Hey, see? It's empty.
- Yeah, yeah. I get it. I get it.

12:11.313 --> 12:14.775
You trust me now?
Now I need to know that I can trust you.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.818
Okay?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.154
And don't ask
for her key card specifically.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.197
All right? Get her whole wallet.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.074
We don't want anybody to know
what we're after.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.909
She's leaving now.
This is our only chance.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.871
Go on. It's game time, son.
Go! Get that bag, boy.

12:27.705 --> 12:28.831
That's it.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.340
- Ma'am.
- Ooh goodness.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.135
- You snuck up on me.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.679
Can I help you with something?

12:44.764 --> 12:45.639
Come on.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.187
- Look, I was just wondering, uh--
-  Wondering what, son?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.025
What are you doing?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.652
I just need your bag, please.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.490
You're not getting my bag, son.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.533
I will bring it back
with everything inside of it.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.160
- Can I please just have your bag?
- Shit.

13:07.536 --> 13:10.331
You're about
the most pitiful excuse for a thief

13:10.331 --> 13:12.041
I've ever seen in my life.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.045
What's the matter with you?
Does your mama know where you are?

13:16.045 --> 13:17.963
You need to be ashamed of yourself.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.813
Ain't exactly Jesse James, are you, kid?

13:34.939 --> 13:35.940
Come on.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.944
We'll just get into the archives
the old-fashioned way.

13:42.154 --> 13:46.408
I just can't believe you're here.
I saw the news. I... I texted you.

13:46.408 --> 13:49.203
I didn't even know
if you were alive, Sarah.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.162
How are you?

13:50.746 --> 13:51.622
You okay?

13:53.624 --> 13:57.586
You know, Top, um,
things are a little tough right now.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.755
Yeah?

14:00.714 --> 14:01.757
Tough how?

14:07.721 --> 14:13.978
We've been after
this... family heirloom of Pope's,

14:13.978 --> 14:15.688
which is why we were gone.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.690
And we ended up losing it,

14:17.690 --> 14:22.653
and unbelievably there might be a chance
that, um, we could get it back tonight.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.238
In Wilmington.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.115
- Okay.
- It's crazy.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.825
Okay. How... how can I help?

14:27.825 --> 14:30.619
- No, I can't ask you to do that.
- No, seriously.

14:30.619 --> 14:35.416
Topper, I feel like if I ask you,
just, like, the person that you are...

14:35.416 --> 14:39.086
- What do you mean, "the person I am"?
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.797
I guess I mean
you're such a giver, Topper.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.466
You're just such a helper,
and I feel like if I ask you--

14:44.466 --> 14:46.552
Sarah, that's just... that's just who I am.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.179
That's just the way I was raised.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.225
And anyway, remember when I said
I would do literally anything for you?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.351
Remember that?

14:54.935 --> 14:55.895
Yeah.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.439
I meant it.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.150
Unlike some people
who will just say whatever to get you

15:01.150 --> 15:02.943
to go along with whatever they want.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.071
I'm not that person, okay?
When I say something, I mean it.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.364
I need your truck.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.785
-  My dad's truck?
- Four wheels.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.456
Oh my God. He would literally kill me.

15:15.456 --> 15:19.335
- He's super anal about it.
- So are we. We're super anal.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.463
We, like... we... we...
we'll take such good care of it.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.424
You put me in a tough spot.
I know I said I'd do anything but...

15:26.216 --> 15:28.052
I'm so sorry about everything.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.934
I totally understand.
You have no reason to help us.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.519
Actually, you have
all the reasons not to help us.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.731
Why do I feel like I'll regret this?

15:54.244 --> 15:56.580
Figured out a way
to get in without a key card?

15:56.580 --> 15:57.665
No plan yet.

15:58.332 --> 16:02.169
Just got to wait for the night to settle.
Less people around, the better.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.630
We'll wait till the witching hour

16:04.630 --> 16:06.966
then get down
to some serious cat burgling.

16:07.925 --> 16:08.968
Grit?

16:10.010 --> 16:11.011
I'm good.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.763
Ah, that a boy.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.728
You know what is true, though?
All faults aside,

16:20.312 --> 16:22.314
it is nice to be back together with you.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.609
Yeah, it is.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.071
It sure is.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.200
Oh, three o'clock, eh?

16:40.791 --> 16:43.836
I think I might've bought
a racehorse at that silent auction.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.005
-  What?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.507
I thought it was a horse ranch.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.676
You know, I'm on the board of directors.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.095
Being on the board has its privileges.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.597
This is it.
This could be our chance.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.141
Oh my God. Really?

16:57.725 --> 16:58.642
Let's go.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.772
My God,
are we allowed to go in here?

17:03.772 --> 17:05.607
-  Hell of a dress, lady.
- Thank you.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.609
I'm about to trip all over it.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.822
About 5% of the collection is ever
on display at any given time.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.615
- The rest of it, it's in here.
- What's--

17:13.615 --> 17:15.909
Really? Are we allowed to? Oh my God.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.745
-  Let's go.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.418
Nice catch!

17:31.842 --> 17:34.053
 Well,
there's like 1,000 trains here.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.889
Well, we know it's car 750X
on the track to Raleigh.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.891
Yeah, so now we just gotta find it.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.350
Well, news flash.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.854
We're not getting out
of here unnoticed with a giant cross.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.899
We won't have to. We can nab it
somewhere further in the country.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.942
Just gotta figure out
how to stop the train.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.694
Right.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.655
- Leave that to me.
- How you gonna do that?

17:53.655 --> 17:55.365
I got an uncle up in New Bern, right?

17:55.365 --> 17:57.618
When he got tipsy,
he'd just throw an old chain

17:57.618 --> 18:00.037
across the tracks,
just for shits and giggles.

18:00.037 --> 18:04.792
And that old little chain
would stop all the train traffic

18:05.459 --> 18:06.919
in coastal Carolina.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.796
- A chain?
-  He's actually right.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.049
There's a low-voltage current
that runs across all rail tracks.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.884
Throw a chain on it,
you close that circuit.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.929
It would read as another train.
Crossing lights come down.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.808
- Science is actually pretty sound.
- Science. I knew my science.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.976
Well, we don't have a chain.

18:23.894 --> 18:28.232
No, but I bet Topper's dad
has jumper cables in the truck.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.484
- Would that work?
- Yeah.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.319
What's going on?
Are we doing this?

18:34.029 --> 18:36.156
All right, you all wait here.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.992
Me and Pope will go look for it
and send a signal once we find it.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.078
- Do we actually have a plan right now?
- Think we do.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.580
- That's impressive.
- Let's not jinx it. Come on.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.415
-  Nobody ever listens to me.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.918
-  Try this.
-  I don't think it's gonna work.

18:47.918 --> 18:51.755
- I have shoulders. I do, I do.
-  You do. Lovely shoulders.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.675
- No, this'll be good with that.
-  Oh. Oh, great.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.009
Shh.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.808
Hey! Look, upstairs.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.897
-  You're trouble!
- Shh!

19:10.691 --> 19:12.860
Look at this place.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.112
It's a gold mine.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.991
Check everything, just check everything
Look for anything Trinity Church.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.536
Anything late 1800s.
Habitats, biodiversity.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.957
Antiques. Pretty cool stuff
but not what we're looking for.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.251
Tiles, grass dividers, come on.

19:31.670 --> 19:35.382
Underground Railroad, rocks.
What we got? Uniforms, coats, buttons?

19:35.883 --> 19:38.010
Swords, scabbards.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.265
Some porcelain, silver plates.

19:43.807 --> 19:44.933
Pottery.

19:46.643 --> 19:47.644
Religious.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.317
John B, hey.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.402
The Trinity Church.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.781
- This is it, buddy.
- No way.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.325
Okay.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.119
Look at this. Look at this, boy.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.123
The mother lode.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.879
This could be it, Bird.
Five hundred years in the making.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.548
Here we are.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.680
It's this track here.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.559
Remember, it's car 750X.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.229
All right, 2-0-4-5.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.858
2-0-1-7.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.572
- What's taking so long?

20:42.991 --> 20:45.786
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.544
7-2-6.

20:55.545 --> 20:56.463
Hold on.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.258
750X, baby.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.301
The is our car!

21:03.303 --> 21:06.223
- Run and tell the other Pogues.
- Careful up there.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.267
- Pope, come on.
- Hey, hey.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.066
Hey.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.820
-  That's it. We're green.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.655
- What's happening?
- You hear that?

21:28.745 --> 21:30.539
- Train's moving. Train's moving.
- Shit, shit.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.500
Cleo, get on. Hurry!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.224
- Hey, Sarah.
- Do you have jumper cables?

21:49.224 --> 21:52.102
- Here I am involved in illegal activities.
- Not that illegal.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.229
I'm not even close
to being okay with this.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.981
- Okay.
- Jumper cables. What are we doing?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.567
Topper, if you don't wanna go, it's fine.
We'll take the truck.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.735
- The truck?
- Yeah.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.322
Hey, I just wanna make sure everyone here
is okay with ending up in federal prison.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.699
Uh, if it gets to that,
yeah, I'll do it for Pope.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.634
Come on.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.554
I really wanted this one.

22:27.554 --> 22:30.015
- Hey, hey. Come on, Dad.
- That's it. That's it.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.350
- It's over!
- No, stop.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.270
- Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. Relax. Shh!
- That's the last of it!

22:35.270 --> 22:37.064
No, it's okay, Dad. Calm down.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.398
What's the point?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.484
- That's the last of the Trinity boxes.
- Shh.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.778
It's over.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.323
It's over.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.369
It was a long shot, anyway.

22:58.001 --> 23:00.087
Goddamn it.

23:08.428 --> 23:11.306
There's so much disappointments,
you know?

23:11.306 --> 23:12.641
Near misses.

23:12.641 --> 23:16.395
-  Hey, Dad, we missed one.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.315
Uh, Dad, we actually missed a box.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.442
-  What is this?

23:23.276 --> 23:25.237
-  What?
- Some sort of rock?

23:33.370 --> 23:34.996
- Look.
- What's it labeled?

23:34.996 --> 23:37.457
"Trinity Church, miscellaneous."

23:41.420 --> 23:42.421
Um...

23:42.963 --> 23:43.797
Dad?

23:44.756 --> 23:46.049
This... this...

23:47.300 --> 23:49.219
This is... this is Kalinago.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.265
A vanished Indigenous people.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.063
Dad?

24:00.647 --> 24:02.524
This could be it, John B.
This could be it.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.569
Look, look.
The stones, they're the same color.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.321
- Holy shit.

24:08.321 --> 24:10.449
-  Let's see if it fits.
- Oh my...

24:11.158 --> 24:12.826
Look, look.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.705
Dude, Dad!

24:23.462 --> 24:24.588
Dad. Dad.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.717
Look at this.
This is the cat serpent.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.054
I think this is a skylight.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.396
Oh, Birdy Boy.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.983
All right.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.283
What the shit is that?

24:53.283 --> 24:56.328
Look at that, boy.
Look at that.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.664
We did it, son.

25:00.874 --> 25:01.833
Together.

25:02.584 --> 25:06.087
Just like I said we would.
You see that? You found it, boy.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.089
What--

25:09.132 --> 25:12.093
We did it.
We did it. That a boy.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.816
Hey!

25:26.816 --> 25:27.859
What?

25:28.443 --> 25:29.736
Just so you know,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.614
I'm not normally this crazy.

25:32.614 --> 25:36.701
It's just getting this cross back.
It means a lot to me.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.745
I have to do this.

25:38.745 --> 25:42.249
- It's worth it.
- It better be after all this shit, man.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.505
- This should be far enough.
- All right.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.759
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.178
All right? Oh God, you can hear it coming.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.556
- Let's fry this sucker.
-  All right.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.975
Okay, now, all you have to do...

25:59.975 --> 26:00.976
Do your trick.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.727
...is change the current.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.688
- Let's go.
- Don't get electrocuted, please.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.982
Yeah, no promises with that.
Three, two, one.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.608
- And red.

26:08.608 --> 26:09.734
Moment of truth.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.115
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.744
Okay. That's what he would do.
That's literally what my--

26:19.744 --> 26:21.621
So then it'd change red-- Oh my God.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.457
Think, think, think.
Okay, what if I blockaded the track?

26:24.457 --> 26:26.167
That's what I could do. Maybe put a tree?

26:26.167 --> 26:29.546
Uh, hey. The train touches
both sides of the track.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.096
Come on. Come on.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.893
Please, we don't have a plan B

26:45.020 --> 26:47.564
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- That's what I'm talking about!

26:49.065 --> 26:52.027
- You're a genius. I was gonna do that.
- Science. No, it's all you.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.570
And now we wait.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.165
It's gonna work. It's gonna work.

27:09.377 --> 27:12.589
The train's stopping.
It's stopping. They did it.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.216
- Shit.
- Come on.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.848
- She's slowing down.
- We got brakes, dude.

27:24.017 --> 27:27.395
Hey, dispatch. Trackside signal lights
are red at block 247.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.731
Repeat, red at block 247. Standing by.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.906
Go check it out. Will you?

27:37.906 --> 27:41.534
This is it, my boy.
There is blood on the tracks.

27:41.534 --> 27:43.912
- We are hot on the trail.
- Yeah. Feels great.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.997
Ha, you're right about that, boy.
It feels great!

27:45.997 --> 27:46.915
Wait, wait, wait.

27:47.832 --> 27:48.792
Dad.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.420
Dad, where's the car? Dad.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.547
It's-- Somebody must have stole it.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.925
Why would somebody steal the Twinkie?

27:56.925 --> 28:00.178
That's all I've got.
That's all I've got, Dad.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.223
- What?
- Oh boy. Looks like Carla found us.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.350
Great.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.311
- Limbrey stole the Twinkie.
- Come on, I know where she lives.

28:11.898 --> 28:12.982
Shit, man.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.609
I almost broke my arm.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.612
- Can you pick the lock?
- Sure.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.953
-  Kie. Back up. Back up.
- Shh!

28:26.246 --> 28:28.456
- Shit.
- No, no, no. That's not part of the plan.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.088
-  You almost done?
- Almost.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.924
-  Hey! Hey!
- Shit.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.884
-  Stay right here.
- Oh shit.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.721
Hey, what are you doing here?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.764
Sir, I'm so sorry.
It is not what it looks like.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.349
I know it looks like we're criminals,

28:46.349 --> 28:48.184
but that's not our intention.
I promise, sir.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.645
What is going on here?

28:51.312 --> 28:53.690
-  Hell if I know.
-  What is this bullshit?

28:54.482 --> 28:55.483
You see this?

28:57.861 --> 28:59.946
What are you doing here?
It's very dangerous.

28:59.946 --> 29:03.825
Just trying to get to the next town over.
We're running away from home. That's it.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.661
You know, I'm not buying it.
I'm sorry, I'm calling for backup.

29:06.661 --> 29:09.664
Sir, please, I see you're married.
Sir, please.

29:09.664 --> 29:11.458
We're in love.
That's all we're trying to do.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.210
We're just trying to get married,
and we can't do that here.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.339
Unhook that for me.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.842
What is going on?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.221
Please, this is my fiancée.

29:26.848 --> 29:30.268
- Please.
- Our parents won't let us be together but...

29:30.268 --> 29:34.939
Sir, we can't get married in this town,
but I love her so much.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.442
And if you'd just let us
get to the next town,

29:37.442 --> 29:39.319
we're gonna find a priest who'll marry us.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.279
And we just wanna start a life together.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.531
- Throw that in the back for me.
-  All right.

29:49.871 --> 29:50.955
Please.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.921
You guys hopping the rails,
it's illegal, okay? But...

30:01.341 --> 30:03.343
I can't stop what I don't see.

30:04.177 --> 30:07.722
So listen, just... go.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.808
Thank you. Sir, what's your name?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.392
It's Jimmy.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.478
That's gonna be
our first child's name, Jimmy,

30:13.478 --> 30:16.064
because of what you've done today.
Thank you so much.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.191
All right. Go.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.777
-  Thank you.
- I don't wanna see you again.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.742
You're all set over here.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.620
Some asshole
put jumper cables on the tracks.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.913
There you go.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.999
They've had enough time, right?

30:38.419 --> 30:39.629
Got it.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.297
You did it! All right.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.598
- Help me get this open.

30:55.478 --> 30:58.481
Okay, it's gotta be in here somewhere.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.317
Start looking.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.235
Help up.

31:07.782 --> 31:10.702
Who the hell are we right now, Sarah?
This is ridiculous.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.747
- Right here.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.335
-  How's it looking?
-  Still searching.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.800
That's good. That's good right there.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.595
- You see it?
-  Hey.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.513
- What?
-  This one says Cameron.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.682
- It might be this one.
-  Cameron Development.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.476
This is it. This is the cross. This is it!

31:35.476 --> 31:37.395
Hey, what are we doing here?

31:37.395 --> 31:40.189
- We'll put this in your truck bed.
- That's gonna scratch the paint.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.650
You'll be able to get
a thousand paint jobs after we do this.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.194
-  This thing right here?
- Just help us spot it.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.446
I got you.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.031
- All right.
-  Topper, help me!

31:48.031 --> 31:51.367
- Help me with the door.
-  Just push it this way.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.453
- My dad's gonna kill me.
-  Guide it.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.749
- Shit.
-  That can't be good.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.418
-  Quick!
-  Hurry up, let's go!

32:00.418 --> 32:03.338
- What is in here? It's stuck. Go back.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.382
- Don't mess up the cross!
- Don't mess up the truck!

32:06.966 --> 32:08.676
All right, all good to go.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.970
- The train's starting.
- We gotta go get them.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.139
- There goes the plan. We gotta help them.
- Come on.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.351
- Come on.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.813
Shit. All right.

32:20.813 --> 32:22.398
Hey, you dropped your...

32:28.237 --> 32:29.405
Why do you have this?

32:30.448 --> 32:33.534
If I'm gonna be accused of being a thief,
might as well get something out of it.

32:33.534 --> 32:36.871
- You're just giving them ammunition.
- Ammunition for what, Kie?

32:38.331 --> 32:40.208
They're already against me. So who cares?

32:40.208 --> 32:42.710
They didn't have a reason.
You're giving them a reason.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.712
Know what?
We don't have time for this. Get on.

32:45.546 --> 32:49.008
-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-  Careful, guy! Oh, stop!

32:49.008 --> 32:50.635
Which way you want it to go?

32:50.635 --> 32:53.721
Dispatch, hold up.
We got a train robbery in progress.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.307
Stop!

32:56.307 --> 32:57.392
Hey, stop!

32:57.392 --> 32:59.602
- We gotta go.
-  Hold it right there.

32:59.602 --> 33:00.603
Cops. Come on.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.939
- The cops are coming. Let's go.
- Punch it, Chewie!

33:02.939 --> 33:03.982
Go!

33:03.982 --> 33:06.985
How the hell can you live like this?
You come from a good family.

33:06.985 --> 33:07.944
Just drive!

33:07.944 --> 33:09.612
- Hey, hey, stop!

33:14.867 --> 33:17.370
They took something off the train.
The cops are in pursuit.

33:22.125 --> 33:22.959
Whoa!

33:22.959 --> 33:24.877
Get on the bike, Kie.

33:28.548 --> 33:29.966
That's Top.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.301
And that's the cross. Get on!

33:52.989 --> 33:55.366
- We got somebody on us.
- That's JJ and Kie.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.795
-  J!
- I know. I know.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.380
What the hell is this kid doing?

34:15.636 --> 34:17.221
What is he doing?

34:17.221 --> 34:18.264
I don't know.

34:19.557 --> 34:22.268
- What are you doing?
- Top, keep going straight.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.937
- Y'all be careful. All right?
- Topper, hold it steady.

34:24.937 --> 34:26.272
I'm trying.

34:26.272 --> 34:28.191
- Get ready to jump.
- What?

34:28.191 --> 34:29.233
What?

34:29.233 --> 34:32.612
- Have you lost your mind?
- Probably! Get ready to jump.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.406
Come on. Come on.
I've got you. I've got you. Come on.

34:36.532 --> 34:37.867
Kie, what are you doing?

34:37.867 --> 34:40.995
-  Easy, easy now.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.830
- Be careful.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.999
- Oh sh--

34:44.999 --> 34:45.917
- What?
- Holy sh--

34:47.960 --> 34:49.712
-  You okay?
- Yeah.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.339
Are you good?

34:51.339 --> 34:52.757
Did she make it?

34:58.638 --> 34:59.764
What's he gonna do?

34:59.764 --> 35:02.058
I don't know.
I don't think he knows either.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.689
He's trying to get killed.

35:08.689 --> 35:11.234
Okay, maybe he's just trying
to get rid of the cops.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.318
Let's dance.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.327
Oh, here we go.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.289
- Damn it!

35:29.877 --> 35:31.587
-  He did it! They're chasing him.
- Shit.

35:31.587 --> 35:32.672
Oh God.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.557
- Topper, stop. Stop the truck.
- Oh my God. I'm not stopping the truck.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.725
- Hey! Stop the truck.
- Stop the truck!

35:44.725 --> 35:46.853
- We're going to get JJ.
- Come on, man!

35:46.853 --> 35:51.232
- I'm not going to jail for you. No chance.
- Stop the truck. Please.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.401
All right. All right, damn it!
All right. All right.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.945
Turn around!

35:55.945 --> 35:59.073
- I'm not going... I'm not going to jail.
- Topper, look at me.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.659
They're gonna arrest him.
We can't leave him behind.

36:01.659 --> 36:02.994
Damn it. Damn.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.188
- Go faster. You need to go faster.
-  I'm trying.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.606
- Let's go!
- Move it!

36:31.606 --> 36:34.275
- I'm risking my life for this shit.
-  It's gonna be fine.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.610
- Turn left!
- No, I'm not--

36:35.610 --> 36:38.487
- Go! Yes! Yes! Topper!
- No. I'm getting out of here.

36:42.783 --> 36:44.493
There he is. What is he doing?

36:50.750 --> 36:52.335
- Turn right.
-  Okay!

36:59.926 --> 37:02.261
- No way, he's up on the overpass.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.018
- Oh fuck!

37:17.401 --> 37:19.070
- Pope, go!
-  Go, go!

37:22.531 --> 37:23.950
Jayj.

37:24.492 --> 37:25.576
Jayj!

37:26.285 --> 37:28.162
Jayj? Where is he?

37:28.162 --> 37:29.497
- Shit!
-  No, no, no, no.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.249
JJ? Jayj!

37:31.249 --> 37:33.668
- Ah, man!
-  You all right?

37:33.668 --> 37:34.752
Yeah, I think so.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.589
Where is he?

37:38.589 --> 37:41.050
-  Maybe he's up on the bridge.
- No, no, no.

37:42.468 --> 37:43.803
Sir, you okay?

37:43.803 --> 37:46.597
- Yeah. Just my neck.
- Don't move your neck. Just stay still.

37:51.477 --> 37:54.313
I wish I could say I did that on purpose,

37:54.313 --> 37:58.526
but that was the gnarliest powerslide
I've ever done.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.362
You're alive!

38:01.362 --> 38:03.531
- Dude!
-  I know, I'm surprised too.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.865
Shit, that was gnarly.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.535
That was trucking, dude. Oh Jesus. Oh God.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.745
We really thought
you did it this time, Jayj.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.622
- Hey, did you call the ambulance?
- Yeah.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.624
We got backup coming, sir. Just relax.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.793
The pleasantries are nice,
but we should get out.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.086
Yeah, yeah, let's roll.

38:21.799 --> 38:24.468
Don't... don't ever do that again.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.058
- Hey! Hey, you kids, don't move.
- Go!

38:31.058 --> 38:33.728
Stay right there. I said stay right there!

38:33.728 --> 38:35.271
- We need backup right away.
-  Go!

38:35.271 --> 38:37.148
- Four or five kids in a Dodge Ram.
-  Go!

38:37.148 --> 38:39.483
They're taking off.
They're headed south. Damn it!

38:41.944 --> 38:44.613
So, yeah,
in return for helping me find you,

38:44.613 --> 38:46.824
I told Limbrey I'd get her shroud.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.826
Right, you're talking about
the healing garment,

38:48.826 --> 38:51.329
the one that cures all maladies,
supposedly in the cross.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.372
- Is that what you're referring to?
- That's the one.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.957
It wasn't in the cross. She checked.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.209
That's how I was able to convince her
I had a bead on it.

38:57.209 --> 38:59.837
And do you have a bead
on this magic healing garment?

38:59.837 --> 39:01.922
Currently, I have zero beads.

39:01.922 --> 39:05.134
I don't have a single magic garment
that can heal all maladies.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.428
Oh, and by the way,
that shroud she's after,

39:07.428 --> 39:08.387
it's a known hoax.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.556
Yeah. I could've guessed that.
Do you have a plan?

39:10.556 --> 39:12.016
Sure, always have a plan.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.227
We are gonna prevaricate
our way out of a pickle, son.

39:15.227 --> 39:17.355
- I don't know what that means.
- You'll figure it out.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.731
Play along if you feel like it.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.816
Yeah. I'd play along
if I knew what the word meant.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.289
Hi.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.415
Hi.

39:36.415 --> 39:38.167
Uh, you got my ride, right?

39:38.167 --> 39:42.171
Yeah, I was tracking you,
first on your boat, then on your phone.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.090
I needed to get your attention.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.717
Just checking.
I came down here to see you, of course.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.802
Oh.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.054
Is that so?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.473
That is so... so.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.685
But first, lookee there.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.897
Oh, hey, Ms. Limbrey. What's up?

40:01.899 --> 40:03.109
You found your son.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.362
And you found your father.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.655
How fortunate.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.573
That bond,

40:09.573 --> 40:13.702
so precious, so... fleeting.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.667
Please, come in.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.294
Here, let me help you.

40:25.756 --> 40:26.674
You heard her. Come on.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.384
Can't do this on the front porch?

40:28.384 --> 40:30.302
- Just come on, be cool. Be cool.
- Be cool?

40:30.302 --> 40:31.387
It's okay.

40:33.931 --> 40:38.060
So, as the Spaniards were coming downriver

40:38.561 --> 40:41.313
out of the headwaters, they were attacked.

40:41.897 --> 40:44.442
The Kalinago warriors
began to loot the ship.

40:44.442 --> 40:48.195
And the priest was... was terrified
that the shroud would be taken

40:48.195 --> 40:49.864
if the natives got the cross,

40:50.364 --> 40:53.200
so he... he took it out of the cross. See?

40:53.200 --> 40:56.203
That's why it wasn't there
when you looked. Yeah?

40:56.203 --> 40:57.955
And then that priest

40:57.955 --> 40:59.290
kept the shroud.

40:59.915 --> 41:02.293
And he... he fled. He took cover.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.378
Eventually--

41:04.378 --> 41:08.716
So what my dad is trying to say is that
the priest ended up on the Royal Merchant

41:08.716 --> 41:10.843
'cause he was the sole survivor
of the San Jose fire.

41:10.843 --> 41:11.802
That's right.

41:12.386 --> 41:13.220
Oh.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.723
And we know all this
because of Denmark's diary,

41:15.723 --> 41:17.475
which my son here found.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.684
With a little help.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.854
- Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
- Yeah.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.023
Then later, the priest,

41:24.607 --> 41:26.400
see, he got dysentery,

41:26.400 --> 41:27.485
and he died.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.364
He was... he was buried here in Charleston.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.243
But if he had the shroud,

41:36.243 --> 41:39.705
why didn't he just... touch it

41:40.706 --> 41:41.874
and heal himself?

41:41.874 --> 41:46.045
That, very valid question. You know,
I was thinking the same thing but--

41:46.045 --> 41:49.798
- That's part of the story.
- Yeah, continue, please.

41:49.798 --> 41:52.801
Because he was so devout,

41:53.886 --> 41:56.847
he was so looking forward

41:57.723 --> 42:00.309
to being reunited
with his Heavenly Father.

42:02.561 --> 42:05.523
We dug up his effects
at the Charleston Museum.

42:09.443 --> 42:10.444
And yes,

42:11.904 --> 42:12.863
we have it.

42:15.991 --> 42:17.451
We have the shroud.

42:21.956 --> 42:24.500
We were just on our way to bring it to you

42:24.500 --> 42:27.670
when you left your... invitation.

42:27.670 --> 42:31.715
I wrapped it up the best I could
with... with what we had on the way.

42:31.715 --> 42:32.883
That is

42:33.926 --> 42:36.387
<i>the</i> shroud right in there.

42:38.055 --> 42:41.016
Thousands of years
to be placed in your hands.

42:45.354 --> 42:48.440
There she is. Behold a thing of magic.

42:51.485 --> 42:54.113
You feel that?

42:56.699 --> 42:58.701
I just got chills. Look at that.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.580
Yes, wow.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.252
That's right.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.924
Do you feel the power of that?

43:52.212 --> 43:55.007
- I'll grab it. I'll just leave it, yeah.
-  You can just--

43:56.425 --> 43:57.509
I don't need your help.

44:17.571 --> 44:18.614
Oh.

44:39.426 --> 44:40.427
I'm healed.

44:43.013 --> 44:43.889
Hallelujah.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.519
Look at you, darling.
How about that?

44:52.648 --> 44:54.900
She walked. It worked.

44:54.900 --> 44:57.236
- What the hell was going on there?

44:57.236 --> 45:00.447
Hey, you have to believe in miracles
if you want them to happen.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.449
It'd be a miracle if this thing starts up.

45:04.159 --> 45:06.829
Gotta believe, boy. I believed it.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.749
El Dorado, here we come.

45:18.298 --> 45:20.968
- Shit, they definitely called it in.
- Top, Top! Turn here!

45:20.968 --> 45:23.220
- Turn here!
- Don't touch... don't touch the driver, man.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.765
- Topper, turn around.
- Stop. He said don't touch the driver!

45:26.765 --> 45:28.767
- It's a liability.
- Then go faster.

45:28.767 --> 45:30.686
If I go faster,
that's gonna draw attention.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.646
Yeah, I feel like that ship has sailed.

45:32.646 --> 45:35.357
You guys are a nightmare.
Do you argue about everything?

45:35.357 --> 45:38.026
- Put the pedal to the metal, boy!
- Yes!

45:38.026 --> 45:40.863
Maybe put it a little bit.
You're going 65!

45:40.863 --> 45:43.907
- All right. Screw it. Here we go.
-  Let's just go faster.

45:43.907 --> 45:46.201
There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.

45:47.369 --> 45:48.620
-  Hey!
-  Stop.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.667
- Stop, stop! We lost the cross!
-  Shit.

45:53.667 --> 45:56.253
- Great, Topper.
- You guys told me to go faster.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.890
-  What the hell?
-  Shit.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.809
It's fake.

46:18.567 --> 46:19.860
It's all a freaking fake.

46:19.860 --> 46:23.697
Of course, we did.
Of course, we stole a fake.

46:25.157 --> 46:26.909
Pope, I'm so sorry.

46:41.548 --> 46:44.676
Y'all hear that? Okay, I can't be here.
My grandfather's a judge.

46:44.676 --> 46:45.803
Dog, would you relax?

46:45.803 --> 46:48.597
They're not gonna think some dude
in flip-flops is a part of a robbery.

46:48.597 --> 46:51.183
Oh yeah, with the crate
sitting right next to my truck.

46:51.183 --> 46:53.393
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Pope, we gotta go.

46:53.393 --> 46:55.354
-  Y'all coming?
-  We got to go.

46:55.354 --> 46:56.438
Pope.

46:57.105 --> 46:58.816
Pope, we got to go.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.776
We gonna find it. We gonna find it later.

47:00.776 --> 47:03.612
- Pope, we gotta go.
- We gonna find it. Come on.

47:03.612 --> 47:05.113
Come on. Come on.

47:17.292 --> 47:20.921
This shit is
straight out of the Pope's vault, bro.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.466
You don't think
we can get more for it as it is?

47:24.466 --> 47:26.927
I mean, this straight out of church, bro.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.856
This is how we turn the cross
into untraceable money.

47:43.193 --> 47:44.278
Untraceable, huh?

47:56.582 --> 47:58.959
You know, I heard some crazy shit
that happened last night.

47:58.959 --> 48:00.627
- Is that right?

48:00.627 --> 48:03.463
- You know that fake cross we put in there?
-  Yeah.

48:06.383 --> 48:07.467
It was stolen.

48:08.802 --> 48:11.889
- Does sound like them Pogues, don't it?
- Oh, no doubt.

48:15.392 --> 48:19.229
I mean, I'd pay half the value of this
just to see the look on their faces

48:19.229 --> 48:20.647
when they opened the box.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.108
I'll bet you would.

48:27.279 --> 48:30.365
You know what the melting point
of gold is, Country Club?

48:32.284 --> 48:34.494
1,948 degrees.

48:36.538 --> 48:38.373
Hot enough to melt me and you.

48:38.916 --> 48:42.169
I got to be honest with you, dog.
I don't know if I got this in me, bro.

48:42.169 --> 48:43.128
I do.

48:47.174 --> 48:49.134
Yeah, I knew you did.

48:50.469 --> 48:52.387
It's all yours, Country Club.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.033
There it is.

49:22.876 --> 49:25.170
We're going to hell.
That's for sure.
