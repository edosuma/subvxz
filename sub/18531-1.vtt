01:50.342 --> 01:54.425
In the summer of 1960,
brutal murders at Lake Bodom

01:54.467 --> 01:57.300
shocked the nation.

01:57.342 --> 02:02.550
Four teenagers were viciously
attacked as they slept in their tent.

02:02.592 --> 02:06.550
The killer is still at large.

02:06.592 --> 02:11.092
As time went by the Bodom mystery
spawned countless of theories

02:11.133 --> 02:15.758
on what really happened
during that fateful night.

02:15.800 --> 02:20.258
This movie was inspired
by those stories.

03:46.925 --> 03:49.008
So?

03:49.050 --> 03:51.717
- They're coming.
- Both of them?

03:52.092 --> 03:54.883
- You're not messing with me, are you?
- No.

03:56.258 --> 03:57.717
You bring them?

04:08.383 --> 04:10.341
These are all too big.

04:11.091 --> 04:14.758
- These are too big!
- That's my mum you're talking about.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.592
Wait a second.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.633
- What are you doing?
- Check this out.

04:30.008 --> 04:32.300
It's got the same pattern.

04:35.925 --> 04:38.425
Imagine Ida wearing these.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.217
- Yes, Ida?
- Can I go out?

05:10.592 --> 05:12.258
Where?

05:14.175 --> 05:16.467
Nora's a good girl.

05:17.842 --> 05:20.050
She's a whore.

05:20.092 --> 05:22.800
Have you forgotten what happened?

05:23.467 --> 05:26.342
Ida embarrassed our whole family.

05:27.050 --> 05:29.467
Ida-Maria, sit down.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.800
I'm not a dog.

05:45.258 --> 05:47.717
What did you say?

05:49.092 --> 05:51.300
I'm not a dog.

05:52.550 --> 05:54.758
Let her go.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.425
You can go.

06:16.633 --> 06:18.633
Stay.

06:21.717 --> 06:23.967
Take care of mum.

06:27.758 --> 06:30.592
- What's the hatchet for?
- It's for your mum.

06:30.633 --> 06:33.717
To pretty her up a bit.
Now gimme that.

06:33.758 --> 06:36.550
You'll need
a bigger hatchet than that.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.842
Amen to that.

06:39.717 --> 06:43.425
I don't get how you got them to come.
A reconstruction?

06:43.467 --> 06:46.758
Right.
But we both get what we want.

06:52.217 --> 06:54.592
They're here.

07:02.883 --> 07:04.967
You sure about this?

07:05.508 --> 07:07.550
Of course.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.383
We agreed on this.

07:11.883 --> 07:13.217
You hear me?

07:13.800 --> 07:16.842
Ida, you haven't been anywhere
in six months.

07:19.217 --> 07:21.717
You've been totally invisible.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.675
What happened to you was horrible.

07:28.633 --> 07:31.342
But together we're stronger.
Right?

07:35.050 --> 07:37.925
This weekend we'll put
all that shit behind us.

07:39.717 --> 07:41.300
Ida.

07:42.092 --> 07:44.342
This will be a new beginning for you.

07:59.592 --> 08:01.758
God, you're pretty.

08:03.383 --> 08:07.092
- You just need some makeup.
- But they're waiting for us.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.925
So what?

08:18.967 --> 08:23.258
I heard Nora's dad killed himself
in the basement.

08:24.757 --> 08:27.050
Hanged himself.
Imagine that.

08:27.092 --> 08:30.800
Please don't start
any of that shit with them.

08:30.842 --> 08:33.092
I'm serious.

08:34.342 --> 08:35.925
They're coming.

08:37.925 --> 08:39.550
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:41.008 --> 08:42.883
I can take that.

08:42.925 --> 08:47.092
- Hi! I can help with that.
- Oh, a gentleman.

08:49.967 --> 08:54.217
- You told anyone about this?
- You think we'd be here if we did?

08:59.883 --> 09:02.092
<i>That makes no sense.</i>

09:02.133 --> 09:07.300
- What? That's how it is!
- Anything goes, just don't get caught?

09:07.342 --> 09:10.342
No. We're talking about
two totally different things.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.175
Girls and guys.
Love and sex.

09:14.217 --> 09:18.175
- How do you make two things out of that?
- They're pairs.

09:18.675 --> 09:22.467
Anyway, guys have different needs
than girls...

09:22.508 --> 09:26.050
- Let's not go there.
- Let me finish.

09:26.633 --> 09:31.633
I'm just saying guys need sex
the way girls need love.

09:32.717 --> 09:36.717
The desire's equal, but the outlet's
completely different.

09:37.050 --> 09:41.133
You might actually
be onto something there.

09:41.675 --> 09:45.592
Guys should have different rules
when it comes to relationships.

09:46.050 --> 09:49.092
The laws of nature
in their purest form.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.467
- You're not buying it?
- No.

09:53.508 --> 09:55.550
- Why not?
- Why?

09:55.592 --> 10:00.050
- Yeah.
- Because it's bullshit.

10:01.217 --> 10:04.092
As if a woman couldn't be
whole without a man.

10:04.467 --> 10:07.133
Or want sex in the same way.

10:08.467 --> 10:10.633
So you want sex.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.800
Don't you want love?

10:18.175 --> 10:22.717
I'm switching sides.
Let's get rid of these pigs.

10:24.383 --> 10:26.425
Is everyone else already there?

10:27.258 --> 10:30.675
Almost.
The rest are coming tomorrow.

11:09.592 --> 11:13.425
- What?
- What the fuck did you tell them?

11:14.425 --> 11:18.842
How do you think I got them to come?
Your charisma only goes so far.

11:21.592 --> 11:23.675
Fuck you.

12:44.967 --> 12:46.758
- Listen.
- What?

12:48.550 --> 12:50.092
It's so quiet.

12:56.258 --> 12:58.008
It's here.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.717
What is this place?

13:08.175 --> 13:10.175
Elias, get the hatchet.

13:50.675 --> 13:54.217
- Move it, guys.
- This cabin of yours better be good.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.342
Fuck...

14:20.342 --> 14:22.592
These fucking bags of yours!

14:28.883 --> 14:30.967
Why did we stop?

14:40.800 --> 14:42.717
This is it.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.842
The rock...

14:46.300 --> 14:48.050
The fireplace...

14:50.342 --> 14:53.508
- This has to be it.
- What?

14:54.008 --> 14:57.175
- I'm not saying anything.
- Where's the cabin?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.592
There is no cabin.

15:07.842 --> 15:09.383
Sorry.

15:09.717 --> 15:12.383
Sit down and I'll explain everything.

15:12.425 --> 15:15.633
What? Did you lie to us?

15:24.008 --> 15:27.758
- Hey, watch it!
- Go get the sticks yourself, then.

15:41.883 --> 15:44.258
I remember this.

15:44.300 --> 15:48.842
Some kids were killed in their tent.
Summer of 1960.

15:49.717 --> 15:53.258
- I didn't know you were interested.
- I'm not.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.175
It says so right here.

15:57.258 --> 16:01.092
Why do you guys care about
this kind of stuff?

16:02.008 --> 16:07.758
The killer's still on the loose.
Isn't that reason enough?

16:07.800 --> 16:11.925
But what's it to you?
You guys get a kick out of this?

16:12.633 --> 16:16.592
What's wrong with you bible-thumpers?
Everything's always about sex.

16:18.717 --> 16:21.008
How about the truth?

16:21.050 --> 16:24.300
And you two are gonna find it out?

16:24.342 --> 16:27.467
Pretending to be a couple of Sherlocks
or something.

16:27.508 --> 16:31.092
- We're doing a reconstruction.
- A what?

16:34.425 --> 16:36.633
I want to test one of my theories.

16:38.508 --> 16:41.092
I can't do it without you and Nora.

16:41.925 --> 16:46.467
You are the same size as the victims,
probably the same weight too.

16:53.592 --> 16:56.050
You two can test these out
all you want.

17:01.341 --> 17:03.758
- What are you doing?
- Pull it.

17:06.966 --> 17:09.550
What a fucking waste.

17:10.050 --> 17:12.300
What are we gonna do?

17:12.716 --> 17:14.133
What time is it?

17:15.425 --> 17:17.966
Half past seven. Why?

17:18.008 --> 17:21.425
- Okay, that'll do.
- That'll do for what?

17:22.300 --> 17:24.758
- Here.
- Where'd you get that?

17:24.800 --> 17:28.300
Make sure the girls smoke enough.
You, take it easy.

17:28.342 --> 17:29.967
Sure.

17:35.092 --> 17:36.883
Party time!

17:36.925 --> 17:38.925
Fucking finally!

17:41.508 --> 17:44.008
- Ida. Have some.
- She won't.

17:44.717 --> 17:48.133
- Everything ready in there, Atte?
- Just about.

17:50.633 --> 17:52.217
Fuck.

17:52.258 --> 17:55.967
Hey, come on. You promised
to go swimming with me.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.300
I'm done.
We should probably get started.

17:59.342 --> 18:02.342
- No fuckin' way.
- I'll go swim with you.

18:02.383 --> 18:06.050
- If you ask me nicely.
- I'm serious, let's get started.

18:06.092 --> 18:09.633
- Will you go?
- We only have a few hours.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.592
I'll come swim with you.

18:16.217 --> 18:19.342
- Can we get started?
- We're not starting anything.

18:19.383 --> 18:22.467
- Go to sleep.
- Guys, the water's freezing.

18:25.550 --> 18:28.758
Ida, tell them so we can get started.

18:29.883 --> 18:32.050
So fucking cold!

18:37.633 --> 18:41.467
- I'm serious!
- Sure you are.

18:50.050 --> 18:52.467
Man, these stink.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.425
They're like fifty years old.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.550
That's why they stink.

19:02.133 --> 19:04.258
What do you think really happened?

19:05.592 --> 19:08.675
You dragged us here
because of some theory of yours.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.217
Contrary to what people think,

19:13.258 --> 19:16.133
I believe the murderer
was an outsider.

19:17.383 --> 19:20.217
Someone with the necessary skillset.

19:22.550 --> 19:25.925
<i>It's not easy to catch
four people by surprise.</i>

19:26.967 --> 19:30.675
<i>And beat them
when they're fighting for their lives.</i>

19:36.092 --> 19:38.800
<i>Maybe he followed them the whole day.</i>

19:38.842 --> 19:41.092
<i>Listened to them having fun.</i>

19:44.175 --> 19:46.342
<i>And then decided to end it.</i>

19:49.425 --> 19:52.425
He knew exactly what he was doing.

19:55.508 --> 19:57.717
<i>He patiently waited
for the right moment.</i>

20:03.550 --> 20:05.508
Then he attacked.

20:14.425 --> 20:16.967
He knew the forest
like the back of his hand.

20:18.050 --> 20:22.467
Like a hunter or something?

20:24.592 --> 20:26.467
I think so.

20:28.258 --> 20:32.133
That's what we're here to find out.
Maybe he's still here.

20:35.758 --> 20:37.300
Right.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.925
If he was young back then,
he might still be alive.

20:40.967 --> 20:43.925
Thanks, now I can't sleep tonight.

20:43.967 --> 20:47.508
- Imagine if he was watching us.
- Atte, don't.

20:47.967 --> 20:51.342
- I'm serious.
- If he saw our tent.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.717
And us by the campfire.

20:56.967 --> 21:00.800
- I wonder what he'd think.
- You know, I really don't care.

21:04.592 --> 21:06.383
I'm going to bed.

21:07.550 --> 21:09.467
Good night.

21:10.842 --> 21:12.800
I'm coming too.

21:14.133 --> 21:17.925
- Nora, you don't have to.
- This is none of your business.

21:46.217 --> 21:49.092
What did you mean when you said

21:50.133 --> 21:53.550
that for us bible-thumpers
everything's about sex?

21:54.758 --> 21:58.133
I don't know.
I was just shooting my mouth off.

22:00.717 --> 22:03.883
I have no right to judge anyone.

22:06.092 --> 22:10.217
No, you're right. At least that's
what it's starting to feel like.

22:10.883 --> 22:13.008
At home, you know.

22:17.633 --> 22:20.758
What happened to you was horrible.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.883
Those photos.

22:26.092 --> 22:28.925
I couldn't imagine
what it would be like.

22:30.258 --> 22:34.175
But what kind of stalker would take
nudie pics of me, anyway.

22:40.175 --> 22:43.300
- But you survived.
- Survived?

22:43.800 --> 22:46.675
I haven't been able
to go anywhere after that.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.050
You're here now.

22:54.633 --> 22:56.925
Because you lied to us.

22:59.550 --> 23:02.342
Think we can go in there yet?

23:02.383 --> 23:04.508
I'll kill the fire first.

23:19.883 --> 23:22.300
You said we're alone out here.

23:23.508 --> 23:25.675
I thought I saw a light.

23:25.717 --> 23:29.092
Out there?
There's no one else here.

23:33.633 --> 23:36.967
- Should we go?
- I have to go wash myself first.

24:19.300 --> 24:21.092
Idiot!

24:22.258 --> 24:25.383
Sorry!
I just needed some water.

24:53.717 --> 24:56.008
You don't like me.

24:57.008 --> 25:00.133
I hope you don't think I'm here
because of you.

25:11.967 --> 25:14.342
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

25:14.383 --> 25:15.883
Ida.

25:18.508 --> 25:20.675
Did you see Elias?

25:20.717 --> 25:22.425
No.

26:18.550 --> 26:20.008
Nora!

26:22.550 --> 26:24.383
What?

26:25.008 --> 26:27.133
What's going on?

26:27.175 --> 26:29.050
Listen.

26:35.675 --> 26:37.175
Elias!

26:39.008 --> 26:41.008
What is it?

26:43.300 --> 26:46.133
- There's someone out there.
- No there isn't.

26:57.467 --> 27:00.133
- Where are you going?
- I'll take a look.

27:00.175 --> 27:03.717
- No, you won't!
- Relax. I'll be right back.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.508
Elias?

28:02.383 --> 28:05.550
- Elias!
- He's just messing around.

28:12.008 --> 28:13.925
Elias!

28:20.842 --> 28:25.092
I'm so disappointed in you guys.
Especially you, Atte.

28:25.758 --> 28:27.842
That wasn't funny!

28:43.258 --> 28:47.342
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee. Thanks to you.

28:47.383 --> 28:49.800
Sorry. Couldn't resist it.

28:50.967 --> 28:53.675
Hey, you need company?

28:54.925 --> 28:58.050
- You know, for safety.
- After what you just did?

28:58.758 --> 29:00.758
Not a chance.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.842
Nora!

29:21.383 --> 29:24.425
Elias won't take no for an answer.

29:26.675 --> 29:29.050
Is there a guy who would?

29:42.925 --> 29:45.717
I need to tell you something.

29:47.342 --> 29:49.092
What?

29:51.967 --> 29:53.633
I...

29:54.800 --> 29:57.758
It's about the pics.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.800
What about them?

30:05.383 --> 30:07.800
I don't know anything for certain...

30:09.925 --> 30:12.342
Do you know who took them?

30:14.008 --> 30:17.592
- Atte?
- It's not that simple.

30:17.633 --> 30:19.675
Who took them?

30:21.800 --> 30:23.592
Atte?

30:28.758 --> 30:30.175
You have to tell me.

30:35.592 --> 30:37.592
What the hell?

30:48.342 --> 30:50.550
<i>Okay, you got us.</i>

30:54.967 --> 30:56.675
Elias?

31:12.342 --> 31:14.133
Atte?

31:15.883 --> 31:18.217
Atte, not funny.

31:27.508 --> 31:31.133
They're trying to scare us again.
Dragged a branch from the forest.

31:35.258 --> 31:36.967
Let's get back at them.

31:38.217 --> 31:39.383
<i>No.</i>

31:39.425 --> 31:40.758
- Come on!
- No.

31:41.383 --> 31:43.425
I'm not interested.

31:46.133 --> 31:49.217
- Let's play dead then.
- I hate that kind of stuff.

31:52.425 --> 31:53.592
Atte?

31:55.258 --> 31:57.258
Stop that.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.592
Stop!

32:05.717 --> 32:07.550
Ida?

32:18.467 --> 32:20.592
This isn't funny.

32:21.550 --> 32:23.383
Elias?

32:51.508 --> 32:53.758
<i>- Nora!
</i>- Ida!

33:08.050 --> 33:11.217
Calm down, it's just me.

33:11.925 --> 33:14.633
It's me.
They're just messing around.

33:14.675 --> 33:16.717
Getting back at us.

33:17.092 --> 33:18.675
<i>Help!</i>

33:23.633 --> 33:25.550
Help!

33:30.383 --> 33:33.008
What the fuck happened here?

33:36.425 --> 33:39.592
- I don't know. He had a knife.
- Who?

33:39.633 --> 33:42.633
- Atte was right! It was him!
- What the fuck?

33:42.675 --> 33:45.925
- Who?
- We need a stretcher.

33:45.967 --> 33:49.008
- What are you talking about?
- It was him!

33:49.050 --> 33:51.300
- Who?
- Help me, goddamnit!

33:54.675 --> 33:56.675
Help!

33:58.842 --> 34:01.133
What are we gonna do?

34:01.883 --> 34:03.717
I'm so sorry.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.717
Don't give up!

34:14.425 --> 34:16.842
We're not gonna leave you.

34:16.883 --> 34:18.883
He's gonna come back, go!

34:19.425 --> 34:21.675
Just fucking go!

34:24.050 --> 34:25.508
Go!

34:27.675 --> 34:29.758
Go!

34:31.383 --> 34:33.383
Go!

35:18.675 --> 35:22.967
Fuck! We shouldn't have left him.
I should've stayed with him.

35:23.008 --> 35:25.675
We don't know how to drive.

35:30.050 --> 35:32.008
Did you hear that?

35:50.175 --> 35:52.217
Ow, shit!

35:57.925 --> 36:00.467
- What happened?
- Don't touch it!

36:01.800 --> 36:04.592
Can you walk?
We'll carry you.

36:06.092 --> 36:07.925
Let's go.

36:12.758 --> 36:15.133
This isn't working.

36:16.008 --> 36:19.133
Let's keep trying.
We can make it.

36:19.467 --> 36:21.508
Just hold on.

36:23.342 --> 36:25.592
No. You can't do it.

36:27.217 --> 36:29.800
- We'll carry you.
- No, you go get help.

36:33.050 --> 36:34.592
You sure?

36:37.592 --> 36:39.717
Take this.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.258
Go!

36:43.300 --> 36:45.675
And hurry back!

37:01.800 --> 37:04.425
Wait! Ida, wait.

37:05.883 --> 37:07.842
This way.

37:13.675 --> 37:15.633
Oh, fuck!

37:16.633 --> 37:18.758
We're back here again.

37:20.758 --> 37:24.508
- I was sure! We're lost.
- Be quiet.

37:24.550 --> 37:27.217
- Fuck!
- Shut the fuck up!

37:27.967 --> 37:29.925
I got this.

37:30.633 --> 37:32.300
We'll find the car.

37:33.342 --> 37:36.425
- Don't lose it now. Okay?
- Okay.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.883
Atte's probably dead by now.

38:27.758 --> 38:29.425
Don't say that.

38:30.050 --> 38:31.633
Sorry.

38:38.508 --> 38:40.842
I didn't know him that well.

38:41.967 --> 38:45.092
I thought you two were best friends.

38:45.133 --> 38:47.383
Maybe if you ask him.

38:48.008 --> 38:50.800
I always thought
he was fucking annoying.

38:55.675 --> 38:58.925
- But you got on well with him.
- What do you mean?

38:59.967 --> 39:03.175
- You two stayed by the fire all night.
- So?

39:03.925 --> 39:07.217
Nothing. It's a free country.

39:09.425 --> 39:12.425
Why did you come out here?

39:12.467 --> 39:13.550
What?

39:20.008 --> 39:22.550
I have my reasons.

39:22.592 --> 39:25.175
It's easy to guess what they are.

39:25.217 --> 39:27.425
We didn't do anything.

39:27.842 --> 39:31.008
- If you think that me and Nora...
- I don't care.

39:34.217 --> 39:35.925
Ida!

39:38.383 --> 39:40.467
Ida, wait!

39:43.842 --> 39:45.425
What?

39:47.050 --> 39:49.967
- I lied.
- About what?

39:52.383 --> 39:54.258
Why I came out here.

39:57.342 --> 39:59.175
I wanted to talk to you.

39:59.633 --> 40:02.758
Without Nora or anyone else around.

40:03.925 --> 40:05.842
About what?

40:06.508 --> 40:09.133
About those photos of you.

40:09.717 --> 40:12.550
- What about them?
- Have you seen them?

40:13.925 --> 40:16.008
Fuck you.

40:16.592 --> 40:19.258
There are no nude pics!

40:21.883 --> 40:23.508
What?

40:25.050 --> 40:28.842
I tried to find them.
And if anyone, I would've found them.

40:30.217 --> 40:34.050
Then Atte realised it.
There aren't any nude pics of you.

40:34.800 --> 40:39.133
When the rumor started,
everyone at school said they saw 'em.

40:39.508 --> 40:41.217
But it was all bullshit.

40:42.258 --> 40:46.133
Someone's messing with you.
Someone wants to hurt you.

40:48.467 --> 40:50.008
Everyone's seen them.

41:02.008 --> 41:05.258
- What?
- Why would I lie to you?

41:05.300 --> 41:07.592
Because you're a guy.

41:08.342 --> 41:12.467
Okay, just think about it:
you pass out at a party,

41:12.508 --> 41:16.342
and someone takes photos of you?
Strips you and shares the pics?

41:16.383 --> 41:18.092
Yeah.

41:19.133 --> 41:21.467
How could you not have seen them?

41:21.800 --> 41:24.800
Or the cops? Your family?
Anyone!

41:25.633 --> 41:27.717
Nora saw them.

41:31.383 --> 41:37.175
Right! And still I'm the one who
feels the need to say I'm sorry.

41:42.133 --> 41:43.883
You don't have to.

41:49.508 --> 41:52.467
Do you really think we believed you?

41:52.508 --> 41:55.300
That we came out here
for some damn cabin party?

41:56.342 --> 41:58.425
You shouldn't brag so much.

42:14.425 --> 42:17.592
I don't know what you think of me,

42:18.342 --> 42:21.300
but I'm here because of you.

42:21.717 --> 42:25.383
I promise that
once we get out of here,

42:25.842 --> 42:28.008
I'll make it all up to you.

42:30.258 --> 42:32.467
It's too late.

42:33.592 --> 42:36.592
Don't say that.
You don't know.

42:38.425 --> 42:40.258
Know what?

42:40.592 --> 42:43.758
My heart...
It only beats for you.

43:18.425 --> 43:21.300
Don't worry, honey.
It's over.

43:22.300 --> 43:24.758
We have to hurry.
We're behind schedule.

43:30.717 --> 43:32.300
Watches.

43:32.925 --> 43:34.050
Three, two, one.

43:38.300 --> 43:40.467
Did you get it?

43:40.508 --> 43:42.925
- Ida, did you get it?
- Sorry.

43:44.967 --> 43:46.342
Then the coveralls.

44:08.342 --> 44:11.258
Next time we'll cut them to pieces.

45:04.550 --> 45:07.925
- That's done.
- Not until we wake up at my place.

45:07.967 --> 45:10.467
Three hours and 26 minutes
until breakfast.

45:12.675 --> 45:15.883
Let's pack up,
get back to town and sink the car.

45:16.758 --> 45:19.883
- Then we'll be free.
- Think we'll make it in time?

45:22.633 --> 45:25.050
- We will.
- Thanks.

45:25.092 --> 45:27.425
You thought of everything.

45:28.008 --> 45:31.050
Now the tough part.

45:31.092 --> 45:33.925
You can do it.
Just remember the clutch.

45:40.008 --> 45:41.842
- What?
- Fuck!

45:42.800 --> 45:44.008
What?

45:45.508 --> 45:47.342
The keys.

45:48.467 --> 45:50.842
Elias has the car keys.

45:58.592 --> 46:00.592
You can do it.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.925
Just keep going.

46:35.717 --> 46:37.217
It's right there.

46:38.758 --> 46:40.342
Dive!

46:41.092 --> 46:42.133
Dive!

47:05.008 --> 47:08.508
- Did you get them?
- I can't do this.

47:09.092 --> 47:12.092
Don't say that.
You're the school champion.

47:12.133 --> 47:16.175
- I'm coming out.
- No, you're not. I won't let you.

47:16.550 --> 47:19.258
- I can't see anything down there.
- Listen,

47:19.300 --> 47:23.050
if they find the car,
they'll find us. It's the only link.

47:24.217 --> 47:26.633
Then they'll win.

47:27.300 --> 47:30.508
Two hours,
twenty minutes until breakfast.

47:33.842 --> 47:37.008
Please, I'm asking you.
You can do it.

47:37.050 --> 47:39.633
<i>I mean it.
You can do it.</i>

49:20.467 --> 49:24.342
Ida!
You got them? You did it!

50:10.717 --> 50:13.383
Let's get the hell out of here!

50:44.217 --> 50:45.967
Nora...

50:48.425 --> 50:50.342
We'll make it in time.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.258
It'll be a while before the sun rises.

50:55.425 --> 50:57.467
It's not that.

51:00.925 --> 51:03.300
It's something Elias said.

51:03.342 --> 51:05.467
Of course.

51:06.925 --> 51:09.258
Well, he's done talking.

51:16.717 --> 51:18.342
Well?

51:18.758 --> 51:20.633
What did he say?

51:20.675 --> 51:23.925
- It's probably bullshit.
- But it got you thinking.

51:24.967 --> 51:26.883
Go on, spit it out.

51:28.008 --> 51:29.967
He said that...

51:31.342 --> 51:33.592
...there are no pics.

51:33.633 --> 51:35.300
Right.

51:35.342 --> 51:38.300
- And you believed him?
- Of course not.

51:41.467 --> 51:44.133
It just made me wonder.

51:44.175 --> 51:46.217
I saw those pics.

51:47.092 --> 51:49.425
They were horrible.

51:50.217 --> 51:53.633
I mean, why else would I be
helping you out here?

51:59.758 --> 52:02.633
Sorry.
So much has happened.

52:03.342 --> 52:06.675
Don't worry. I get it.
A lot has happened to me, too.

52:08.633 --> 52:10.967
But you're free now.

52:13.008 --> 52:15.050
And so am I.

52:23.175 --> 52:25.467
So what was in them?

52:26.008 --> 52:27.633
The pics?

52:28.092 --> 52:30.758
I've told you a million times.

52:30.800 --> 52:33.592
But, you know, specifically.

52:34.967 --> 52:37.383
Haven't we talked this through?

52:37.425 --> 52:40.133
It's better you don't know.

52:41.258 --> 52:43.633
You couldn't handle it, trust me.

52:50.758 --> 52:52.383
Come on, don't.

52:53.217 --> 52:55.758
The guys got what they deserved.

52:55.800 --> 52:59.758
And we can be like before.
Just the two of us, okay?

53:06.425 --> 53:09.425
Except... we can't see
each other any more.

53:09.883 --> 53:11.883
Are you serious?

53:13.258 --> 53:16.592
Just think about it.
Nothing else ties us to them.

53:18.508 --> 53:20.467
Oh, fuck.

53:20.925 --> 53:23.300
You're such a brat.

53:23.842 --> 53:27.633
If anything, we've got
even more reason to be friends now.

53:29.467 --> 53:32.383
But we're not just friends.

53:33.592 --> 53:36.842
- I mean to you we're not.
- What did you just say?

53:37.217 --> 53:39.050
Sorry.

53:40.175 --> 53:42.467
You better be.

53:59.717 --> 54:02.633
You're so fucking ungrateful!

54:02.675 --> 54:06.633
Who wanted them dead?
You or me?

54:07.050 --> 54:11.342
You! Who else would've
helped you if not me?

54:12.342 --> 54:14.675
Just think about that!

54:14.717 --> 54:18.758
You don't even understand
how much I've done for you!

54:19.467 --> 54:24.133
Your parents are so fucking right.
You're totally useless.

54:33.425 --> 54:35.175
Sorry.

54:42.967 --> 54:46.300
If you really love me, then tell me.

54:50.258 --> 54:53.508
Were there really any pics,
or did you make it all up?

55:09.175 --> 55:13.883
<i>You think it was easy listening to you
talk up Elias day after day?</i>

55:19.008 --> 55:21.967
<i>I knew I'd lose you to him.</i>

55:22.925 --> 55:25.842
<i>He was all you ever
talked about anymore.</i>

56:02.050 --> 56:04.383
<i>That's when it hit me.</i>

56:06.633 --> 56:09.758
<i>I figured out
how to get you back from Elias.</i>

56:47.967 --> 56:50.842
<i>I knew I would lose you soon.</i>

57:02.050 --> 57:03.925
<i>Seriously.</i>

57:05.383 --> 57:07.758
<i>It was so simple.</i>

57:13.175 --> 57:16.342
<i>It only took a couple of drinks.</i>

57:24.050 --> 57:26.467
<i>And one ugly rumour.</i>

57:38.925 --> 57:41.800
<i>Suddenly everyone was talking
about your nude pics.</i>

57:43.508 --> 57:46.300
<i>They claimed they'd seen them.</i>

57:50.717 --> 57:53.633
<i>They claimed they'd seen the pics.</i>

58:01.633 --> 58:04.425
<i>Photos that didn't even exist.</i>

58:16.092 --> 58:18.508
<i>All I needed was a scapegoat...</i>

58:18.550 --> 58:20.467
<i>Elias.</i>

58:23.425 --> 58:26.008
<i>And from that moment on...</i>

58:26.300 --> 58:28.592
<i>...you were my girl again.</i>

58:34.967 --> 58:37.592
<i>But people can be monstrous.</i>

58:49.425 --> 58:51.800
<i>Then you said it.</i>

58:51.842 --> 58:54.258
<i>Three beautiful words.</i>

58:58.592 --> 59:00.883
They should die.

59:06.550 --> 59:09.925
<i>All that was needed
was an opportunity.</i>

1:00:05.758 --> 1:00:09.842
<i>What's best is that they thought
they were playing us.</i>

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:17.633
- I trusted you.
- That's always been your weak spot.

1:00:21.925 --> 1:00:25.842
When we get home,
I'm gonna tell everything.

1:00:26.967 --> 1:00:29.300
I was afraid you'd say that.

1:00:35.092 --> 1:00:38.008
Don't start blubbering.
You deserved that.

1:00:47.217 --> 1:00:49.050
Get off!

1:00:49.717 --> 1:00:51.717
I'll kill you!

1:00:59.675 --> 1:01:01.633
Watch out!

1:01:11.883 --> 1:01:13.800
Don't touch me!

1:01:50.633 --> 1:01:52.967
Ida?

1:01:54.342 --> 1:01:56.467
Hey, wake up.

1:02:01.342 --> 1:02:03.842
Ida, are you all right?

1:02:41.383 --> 1:02:44.383
Ida, can you hear me?

1:02:44.883 --> 1:02:46.842
Wake up.

1:02:51.175 --> 1:02:53.467
Ida, wake up.

1:03:40.550 --> 1:03:42.925
Is everything okay?

1:03:50.258 --> 1:03:51.967
Can you put the light away?

1:03:56.592 --> 1:03:58.508
You're in luck.

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:08.925
Ida, wake up.

1:04:14.008 --> 1:04:16.342
Come on, wake up.

1:04:18.175 --> 1:04:20.258
Did you see him?

1:04:47.675 --> 1:04:51.383
- What are you doing?
- He saw us. And the car.

1:04:53.508 --> 1:04:54.883
Fuck!

1:04:59.717 --> 1:05:03.508
Same as before. You distract him
and I hit him from behind.

1:05:04.175 --> 1:05:05.383
No!

1:05:06.300 --> 1:05:08.175
I'm done with this.

1:05:18.508 --> 1:05:21.383
- Give me your knife. I packed mine.
- What knife?

1:05:23.258 --> 1:05:26.633
- But what did you kill Atte with?
- What?

1:05:27.008 --> 1:05:29.342
It was you who killed him.

1:05:30.092 --> 1:05:31.758
No.

1:05:43.883 --> 1:05:45.258
Fuck.

1:06:07.467 --> 1:06:08.467
Fuck!

1:06:43.050 --> 1:06:44.925
Let's jump out!

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:13.092
- Nora! Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:07:14.467 --> 1:07:16.508
It won't open!

1:07:22.425 --> 1:07:24.800
Get in the back.

1:07:25.967 --> 1:07:27.050
Go!

1:07:48.383 --> 1:07:50.508
Ida, jump!

1:07:51.092 --> 1:07:53.133
Do it!

1:07:53.592 --> 1:07:55.508
Jump!

1:10:33.758 --> 1:10:35.883
Nora!

1:10:41.925 --> 1:10:43.883
He's coming.

1:10:48.508 --> 1:10:50.717
Please, wake up.

1:10:54.758 --> 1:10:56.883
He's coming.

1:10:59.508 --> 1:11:00.925
Let's go.

1:11:04.467 --> 1:11:06.800
Oh, shit.
Can you move?

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.800
- No.
- Not at all?

1:11:12.508 --> 1:11:13.758
Go.

1:11:17.008 --> 1:11:19.383
No. I won't leave you.

1:11:19.842 --> 1:11:21.758
- Go.
- No.

1:11:22.175 --> 1:11:24.717
You have to make it.

1:12:02.008 --> 1:12:03.175
Run!

1:12:05.842 --> 1:12:07.258
Run!

1:12:20.508 --> 1:12:21.508
<i>Help!</i>

1:18:43.967 --> 1:18:46.550
<i>No one believed her.</i>

1:18:47.092 --> 1:18:49.800
<i>Of course the cops combed the forest,</i>

1:18:49.842 --> 1:18:52.467
<i>looking for a giant and his dog.</i>

1:18:52.967 --> 1:18:55.758
<i>But they never found anything.</i>

1:18:56.633 --> 1:18:58.717
<i>And why would they have?</i>

1:18:59.342 --> 1:19:02.300
<i>Everyone knew there was no giant.</i>

1:19:04.383 --> 1:19:06.508
<i>Only one messed up girl.</i>

1:19:12.842 --> 1:19:16.467
<i>She couldn't even admit to herself
what she had done.</i>

1:19:18.175 --> 1:19:21.008
<i>And I guess
that's what broke her in the end.</i>

1:19:30.883 --> 1:19:32.508
Here it is.
