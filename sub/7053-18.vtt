00:07.741 --> 00:09.409
Walter, I don't remember any of that.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.277
I can't let Peter die again.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.212
What did you mean by that?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.914
I designed a device

00:14.982 --> 00:17.216
intended to cross the
time-space continuum

00:17.284 --> 00:20.920
and retrieve my dying son.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.455
Walter, I gotta tell Peter the truth.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.890
Things have never been better between us.

00:23.957 --> 00:27.093
I can't lose him again. I can't!

00:27.161 --> 00:30.163
Give me time to prepare. Please.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.550
Excuse me, ma'am. Do you
have any spare change?

00:50.617 --> 00:52.118
Thank you. God bless.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.954
Excuse me, sir. Do you
have any spare change?

00:55.022 --> 00:55.955
No. No, I'm sorry.

00:56.023 --> 00:59.158
Anything you can manage, sir.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.860
Thank you.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.529
God bless you anyway, sir.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.575
Spare change?

02:01.922 --> 02:04.390
Oh, God.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.659
Oh, God.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.294
No, no, please! Let me outta here!

02:08.362 --> 02:09.428
Help!

02:09.496 --> 02:11.497
Let me outta here!

Leave a message.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.822
It's Peter. Pick up.

03:13.160 --> 03:17.029
Hey, Walter. It's Peter.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.665
Your son, Peter.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.767
Come on, Walter. Pick up the phone.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.369
Walter, pick up the receiver,

03:23.437 --> 03:26.239
and hit the square black button
next to the red flashing light.

03:26.306 --> 03:27.273
You remember?

03:27.341 --> 03:28.307
All right, fine.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.609
When you get this,

03:29.676 --> 03:30.743
I want you to get your Kit together.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.545
I just got off the phone with Olivia.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.980
She said there was an incident on a train,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.982
and I know how much you love trains.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.483
Thought it might cheer you up.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.119
Be home to pick you up
in 15 minutes, all right?

04:14.554 --> 04:16.689
Have you noticed anything weird?

04:16.757 --> 04:19.625
Not yet, but give it ten minutes.

04:19.692 --> 04:20.926
I was actually talking about Walter.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.029
Hello. I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.864
He's been avoiding me all week.

04:24.931 --> 04:25.931
He didn't even look at me

04:25.999 --> 04:27.199
on the car ride over here.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.501
He's stopped eating.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.735
I got him a new box of Peak Freans.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.170
He hasn't even opened it.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.005
Well, did he say something?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.007
No, all week it feels like he's been

04:35.075 --> 04:37.109
enveloped in this... sadness.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.081
I haven't noticed anything.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.531
Oh, my.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.401
Sir.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.535
What are you doing?

05:36.603 --> 05:37.570
I'm checking their underwear.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.171
Their underwear?

05:39.239 --> 05:42.408
I'm sure you're familiar
that with sudden death

05:42.476 --> 05:46.679
victims often experience
a sudden bladder release

05:46.747 --> 05:49.849
of urine, and sometimes excrement.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.451
Get off this train.

05:52.519 --> 05:56.055
He's with me.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.523
Thank you.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.393
I don't know what happened
to these people, agent Dunham.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.963
My first guess is
collective heart failure.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.231
You think these people died from having

06:05.298 --> 06:06.932
a heart attack at the same time?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.935
Perhaps it was sympathetic.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.937
Contagious, like yawning.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.038
Come on, Walter.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.341
You really believe that?

06:26.820 --> 06:29.355
Walter, does your theory
suggest why all the lights

06:29.423 --> 06:31.290
would be out in this car?

06:31.358 --> 06:34.226
No, there should be battery backup.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.962
Unless it wasn't serviced properly.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.331
Agent Dunham?

06:49.609 --> 06:50.910
He crossed paths with the man

06:50.977 --> 06:52.111
as he entered the train car.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.614
Six foot, brown hair,
wearing a trench coat.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.550
And he's sure that he saw him coming

06:57.617 --> 06:58.951
out of this train car.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.220
The man didn't speak to
him or acknowledge him.

07:01.288 --> 07:04.089
He just exited down the
stairs of the platform.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.291
Did we pick him up on surveillance?

07:05.358 --> 07:08.127
I'm waiting to get word if they
can pull him on any footage.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.373
Agent Dunham.

07:29.716 --> 07:35.421
Hey, Rod, found this over there.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.655
Oh, my God.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.657
Excuse me, gentlemen.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.459
That's mine.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.462
Thank you. Thank you.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.763
All the batteries are dead.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.066
It's not just the lights that went out.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.434
This is her cell phone,
but they're all dead.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.203
All the cell phones, laptops, mp3 players.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.838
They're all completely drained of power.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.007
Any theories, Dr. Bishop?

07:55.075 --> 07:56.709
Oh, no.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.245
Except my initial theory of collective

07:59.312 --> 08:02.081
heart failure is probably incorrect.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.351
I'll need to take some of
these bodies back to the lab.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.853
Six or seven should suffice.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.692
We have an image from
the platform cameras.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.333
Who is this guy?

08:21.401 --> 08:22.501
And how did he kill everything

08:22.569 --> 08:24.470
on this train?

08:31.594 --> 08:33.861
This is unusual.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.398
Dying organisms struggle
for their last breath,

08:36.466 --> 08:37.566
but these people appear

08:37.634 --> 08:40.936
as if their switches have
simply been turned off.

08:41.004 --> 08:43.238
Hey, how's it coming in here?

08:43.306 --> 08:45.841
Hi, Peter. Not very good.

08:45.909 --> 08:47.910
Take samples of this man's
lung, brain, and skin.

08:47.977 --> 08:49.812
Something's not right here.

08:49.879 --> 08:51.480
Yup, I think it's my paycheck.

08:51.548 --> 08:52.481
Hmm?

08:52.549 --> 08:56.418
Whatever it is, I'm sure you're
gonna make sense out of it, Walter.

08:56.486 --> 08:58.353
Walter.

08:58.421 --> 09:00.255
What's going on with you?

09:00.323 --> 09:02.291
Is there something wrong?
Something you wanna talk about?

09:02.358 --> 09:05.828
No, everything's fine.

09:05.895 --> 09:09.698
Astro, show me those previous
cellular samples, please.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.838
That's extraordinary.

09:15.905 --> 09:18.073
The ATP concentrations are unusually low.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.642
Cellular process should
continue for hours,

09:20.710 --> 09:22.377
even after death, but
this man's mitochondria

09:22.445 --> 09:24.213
seems to have ceased functioning

09:24.280 --> 09:25.447
well before it should.

09:25.515 --> 09:28.517
What do you say I take samples of the rest

09:28.585 --> 09:31.019
and see if there's a trend?

09:33.923 --> 09:35.257
So what are you saying, Walter?

09:35.325 --> 09:37.192
That something was able
to reach inside of these

09:37.260 --> 09:38.427
people's mitochondria and just...

09:38.495 --> 09:40.229
drain them, like the batteries

09:40.296 --> 09:42.464
in all of the electrical
devices on the train.

09:42.532 --> 09:44.767
It wasn't just their
hearts that stopped beating.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.702
It was every cell in their bodies.

09:46.770 --> 09:48.504
What do you think could
possibly do something like that?

09:48.571 --> 09:51.039
I have no idea.

09:53.209 --> 09:55.144
20 years ago a person walking

09:55.211 --> 09:56.512
through Boston for two hours showed up

09:56.579 --> 09:59.214
on an average of ten
different surveillance cameras.

09:59.282 --> 10:01.150
Now, it's hundreds.

10:01.217 --> 10:03.786
Bad for privacy, but good for us.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.121
I've asked them to output each
source to a different monitor.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.623
Give us a sense of the
route our suspect took.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.324
Play it.

10:10.493 --> 10:12.127
He exits the train station,

10:12.195 --> 10:15.230
crossing Ferris Ave. , continuing north.

10:15.298 --> 10:17.099
This is from the bank on Howard Street.

10:17.167 --> 10:18.767
Coming around the corner.

10:18.835 --> 10:21.804
There, he enters a cafe.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.906
He spent almost 45 minutes inside,

10:23.973 --> 10:26.441
then left the establishment.

10:26.509 --> 10:28.277
The guy kills a train full of people

10:28.344 --> 10:29.645
and then stops for a meal?

10:29.712 --> 10:32.247
And the trail goes cold there.

10:32.315 --> 10:35.784
Once he left the cafe, we couldn't
locate him on any other cameras.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.987
But we have a place to start.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.856
Cafe Wilusa.

10:40.924 --> 10:43.225
Yeah, he was here this morning.

10:43.293 --> 10:44.993
He comes in all the time.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.528
Weird guy.

10:46.596 --> 10:47.596
Weird how?

10:47.664 --> 10:49.431
Well, he always draws on stuff,

10:49.499 --> 10:51.099
like the napkins and the placemats.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.268
Well, what sort of stuff does he draw?

10:53.336 --> 10:54.536
Some kind of math, I think.

10:54.604 --> 10:56.138
To be honest, my higher math

10:56.206 --> 10:58.106
ends at calculating my tip, so...

10:58.174 --> 10:59.908
Does he ever pay with a credit card?

10:59.976 --> 11:01.977
Sometimes he does.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.415
Here. This is him.

11:09.152 --> 11:11.353
Alistair Peck.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.055
Thank you. This will really help.

11:43.686 --> 11:45.687
Send the Bishops up, please.

11:47.991 --> 11:50.592
These mathematical formulae

11:50.660 --> 11:52.527
are extraordinarily complex.

11:52.595 --> 11:54.529
Physicists use diagrams like these

11:54.597 --> 11:58.433
to shorthand ideas about how
subatomic particles behave.

11:58.501 --> 12:01.503
These are sublime.

12:01.571 --> 12:05.340
This may explain his flourish
for numerical wallpapering.

12:05.408 --> 12:08.777
Astrophysics. He teaches at M.I.T.

12:08.845 --> 12:13.181
If I comprehend this correctly,
then this Alistair Peck

12:13.249 --> 12:17.586
has taken Einstein's theory of
relativity and turned it on its ear.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.888
I grasp portions of it,

12:19.956 --> 12:21.356
tachyons are depicted here,

12:21.424 --> 12:23.025
but I fail to see their relevance.

12:23.092 --> 12:25.093
However, it does confirm

12:25.161 --> 12:27.095
that Dr. Peck was dealing with

12:27.163 --> 12:30.032
tremendous energy to do...

12:30.099 --> 12:32.401
Whatever it is he's doing.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.956
What are you doing with my things?

13:09.906 --> 13:12.341
Peck is here, he's downstairs.

13:23.252 --> 13:25.854
I guess that explains what all
the surgical tools were for.

13:25.922 --> 13:30.225
What did you do to the
people on that train?

13:30.293 --> 13:32.961
12 innocent people.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.731
Those people aren't dead, miss.

13:35.798 --> 13:38.867
Not permanently.

13:38.935 --> 13:40.869
Of course they're dead.

13:40.937 --> 13:42.337
But they soon won't be.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.974
Although, others soon will be, I'm afraid.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.843
Dr. Peck, I want you to lie down

13:47.910 --> 13:50.012
on the ground now.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.413
Don't take my computations.

13:51.481 --> 13:54.049
They're meaningless to you.

13:54.117 --> 13:55.717
It is well within my ability

13:55.785 --> 13:57.152
to make it so that you are never in

13:57.220 --> 13:58.520
possession of the things I require.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.890
You've implanted a faraday mesh.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.892
What are you talking about, Walter?

14:03.960 --> 14:06.795
A shield, to create a temporal
pocket around your body.

14:06.863 --> 14:08.130
Of course.

14:08.197 --> 14:09.231
Of course, what?

14:09.298 --> 14:10.232
Why would he need a temporal pocket?

14:10.299 --> 14:12.034
That's fantastic.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.236
Dr. Peck, what are you doing?

14:14.303 --> 14:16.138
Dr. Peck?

14:16.205 --> 14:18.106
Walter, what's happening?

14:32.822 --> 14:35.123
Spare change?

14:35.191 --> 14:38.527
I'm sorry you have to
go through this again.

14:49.572 --> 14:52.040
Oh, God.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.642
Oh, God.

15:24.029 --> 15:25.630
Have you noticed anything weird?

15:25.697 --> 15:28.799
Not yet, but give it ten minutes.

15:28.867 --> 15:31.369
I was actually talking about Walter.

15:31.436 --> 15:34.272
Excuse me. I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.

15:34.339 --> 15:36.774
Is this the car?

15:38.944 --> 15:41.412
Must be the car.

15:44.383 --> 15:46.951
Oh, my.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.393
And there's nothing else you can give me?

15:55.460 --> 15:57.495
No other information?

16:03.969 --> 16:05.937
Here's the initial report.

16:06.004 --> 16:07.238
You think these people

16:07.306 --> 16:09.407
died from having a heart
attack at the same time?

16:09.474 --> 16:11.776
Perhaps it was sympathetic.

16:11.843 --> 16:14.879
Contagious, like yawning.

16:22.621 --> 16:25.222
Walter, does your theory
suggest why all the lights

16:25.290 --> 16:27.024
would be out in this car?

16:27.092 --> 16:28.726
No, there should be battery backup.

16:28.794 --> 16:31.028
Unless it wasn't serviced properly.

16:31.096 --> 16:33.030
I'll need to take some of these bodies

16:33.098 --> 16:34.298
back to the lab.

16:34.366 --> 16:35.800
Six or seven should suffice.

16:35.867 --> 16:39.537
Agent Dunham?

16:47.879 --> 16:49.814
He crossed paths with the suspect

16:49.881 --> 16:51.082
as he entered the train car.

16:51.149 --> 16:52.984
Says the man was in a raincoat.

16:53.051 --> 16:54.251
Six foot, brown hair.

16:54.319 --> 16:55.519
Says he touched the hand rail.

16:55.587 --> 16:57.455
We're dusting for prints.

16:57.522 --> 16:59.557
Hi there.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.659
Uh, the man from the train...

17:01.727 --> 17:03.327
did he say something to you?

17:03.395 --> 17:04.395
Yeah.

17:04.463 --> 17:05.963
What did he say?

17:06.031 --> 17:08.465
"I'm sorry you have to
go through this again."

17:08.532 --> 17:09.634
Again?

17:26.752 --> 17:27.885
And what then?

17:27.953 --> 17:30.988
He stepped off the stairs and walked away.

17:31.056 --> 17:33.124
Agent Broyles,  Agent Dunham.

17:36.161 --> 17:37.428
All the batteries are dead.

17:37.496 --> 17:39.163
All the cell phones, laptops...

17:39.231 --> 17:40.798
they're completely drained of power.

17:43.101 --> 17:44.935
Hey, Ron...

17:45.003 --> 17:47.772
Look, I found this on
the floor over there.

17:47.839 --> 17:49.240
Oh, my God.

17:49.307 --> 17:51.442
Oh, thank you, thank you!

17:51.510 --> 17:52.710
That... that... that's mine.

17:52.778 --> 17:54.178
He found it on the floor up there.

17:54.246 --> 17:58.082
Oh? Oh. Thank you.

18:03.055 --> 18:05.056
The mitochondria were depleted?

18:05.123 --> 18:06.490
Yup, completely drained.

18:06.558 --> 18:08.426
The victims didn't die
of a group heart attack,

18:08.493 --> 18:10.761
they were just completely
drained of biological energy.

18:10.829 --> 18:12.396
Just like their phone batteries.

18:12.464 --> 18:14.198
Pretty much. How is the question.

18:14.266 --> 18:16.467
Walter's still working
on it. I'll let you know

18:16.535 --> 18:18.235
if he finds out anything else.

18:18.303 --> 18:19.403
Okay.

18:19.471 --> 18:21.806
Dunham... we managed to I.D.

18:21.873 --> 18:23.974
the print we lifted off
the train car railing.

18:24.042 --> 18:25.142
We got lucky.

18:25.210 --> 18:28.112
They matched a set NASA has on file.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.114
Dr. Alistair Peck.

18:30.182 --> 18:31.982
What did he do at NASA?

18:32.050 --> 18:34.785
He was classified as part of a think tank.

18:34.853 --> 18:36.587
We don't know much more than that, yet.

18:36.655 --> 18:37.922
Well, we know that he lives here.

18:37.989 --> 18:40.558
412 Inman Street.

19:01.980 --> 19:05.049
Send the Bishops up, please.

19:12.491 --> 19:14.692
Mr. Peck may have done
project work for NASA,

19:14.760 --> 19:16.060
but he's employed locally.

19:17.896 --> 19:21.699
Astrophysics. He teaches at M.I.T.

19:24.736 --> 19:26.570
What?

19:26.638 --> 19:28.372
Wow, I'm having déjà vu.

19:29.808 --> 19:31.842
Yeah, I read that déjà vu is fate's way

19:31.910 --> 19:33.844
of telling you that you're exactly

19:33.912 --> 19:35.412
where you're supposed to be.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.915
That's why you feel like
you've been there before.

19:37.983 --> 19:40.885
You are right in line
with you're own destiny.

19:40.952 --> 19:43.454
Well, do you believe that?

19:43.522 --> 19:45.589
Mm... no.

19:45.657 --> 19:49.693
It's a bit mystical for my taste.

19:49.761 --> 19:51.128
I never get them, myself.

19:51.196 --> 19:55.766
Maybe that's 'cause I'm not
on track with my own destiny.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.434
Huh, look at this.

19:57.502 --> 19:59.937
What is it?

20:00.005 --> 20:01.772
A photo album.

20:09.281 --> 20:11.448
Okay.

20:11.516 --> 20:14.618
But who are you?

20:14.686 --> 20:16.687
What's your name?

20:26.264 --> 20:27.865
Huh.

20:27.933 --> 20:33.437
Well, one of them is bound
to be back sooner or later.

20:33.505 --> 20:36.106
Hopefully sooner.

20:43.448 --> 20:44.982
Shall we go home now?

20:45.050 --> 20:47.151
I'm tired of waiting.

20:51.323 --> 20:54.825
Olivia... might I come with you?

20:54.893 --> 20:56.961
In your car?

20:57.028 --> 20:58.696
I can't drive home with him.

20:58.763 --> 20:59.964
I can't look at him.

21:00.031 --> 21:01.732
Walter, you can't keep doing this.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.001
Peter knows that
something's upsetting you.

21:04.069 --> 21:06.971
I've written him a letter.

21:07.038 --> 21:11.742
Instead of me stammering in fits
and starts, a letter is more concise.

21:11.810 --> 21:14.912
It explains everything
in just the right words.

21:18.049 --> 21:20.050
Except that every time I
think I'm ready to tell him,

21:20.118 --> 21:23.387
I envision his reaction when he reads it

21:23.455 --> 21:27.558
and I run the scene in
my mind again and again.

21:27.626 --> 21:32.696
And every time, the outcome is terrible.

21:32.764 --> 21:35.599
But I will do it.

21:35.667 --> 21:38.168
But first...

21:38.236 --> 21:41.238
there's something I'm
waiting for, Agent Dunham...

21:41.306 --> 21:43.908
something important.

21:43.975 --> 21:46.310
Hey, guys, check this out.

21:46.378 --> 21:48.846
Templates. Forms.

21:48.914 --> 21:51.215
What are they for?

21:51.283 --> 21:52.549
Well, they're what you'd
use to cast machine parts,

21:52.617 --> 21:53.884
but these look like they were handmade.

21:53.952 --> 22:01.725
This one is dated several months
ago, this one even earlier.

22:01.793 --> 22:05.229
He refers to them as prototypes.

22:05.297 --> 22:07.097
But prototypes for what?

22:45.221 --> 22:47.890
Alistair Peck was a
professor here for six years.

22:47.957 --> 22:51.426
His focus... obsession...
was particle acceleration.

22:51.494 --> 22:54.997
Um, creating wormholes
without a particle collider.

22:55.064 --> 22:56.331
All right, you're saying that Dr. Peck's

22:56.399 --> 22:57.900
area of expertise was time travel?

22:57.967 --> 22:59.768
He kept cranking out
theories, and eventually

22:59.836 --> 23:01.270
every one of them was over our heads.

23:01.337 --> 23:03.839
That must have been
frustrating for his superiors.

23:03.907 --> 23:06.441
Embarrassing is a better classification.

23:06.509 --> 23:08.477
They wanted to fire
Alistair but he saved them

23:08.545 --> 23:11.113
the trouble and left, about a year ago.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.282
Is this his wife?

23:17.053 --> 23:18.487
Ah, the fiancée.

23:18.555 --> 23:19.988
Her name is Arlette.

23:20.056 --> 23:21.590
Do you remember her last name?

23:21.658 --> 23:23.091
I don't recall, no.

23:23.159 --> 23:25.394
Do you know any other
friends he might have had?

23:25.461 --> 23:26.662
People he knew?

23:26.729 --> 23:27.830
That's the sad thing.

23:27.897 --> 23:28.964
He was kind to everyone,

23:29.032 --> 23:30.265
but he never socialized.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.134
I think I was his only friend.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.570
Well, anything that you can remember

23:34.637 --> 23:37.739
about Mr. Peck, it could be important.

23:41.344 --> 23:43.579
Alistair sent me these
about six months ago

23:43.646 --> 23:44.680
to proofread.

23:44.747 --> 23:46.148
He had hopes of seeing them published.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.683
Uh, can we take them?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.117
They're only gathering dust here.

23:49.185 --> 23:50.652
They are pretty dense.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.521
Most would say it's gobbledegook.

23:52.589 --> 23:54.489
Well, I happen to know

23:54.557 --> 23:57.726
someone who's fluent in gobbledegook.

23:59.696 --> 24:02.631
I'm finished.

24:02.699 --> 24:04.433
In another 20 years, with the assistance

24:04.500 --> 24:05.701
of some other great minds,

24:05.768 --> 24:09.438
I will have absorbed this information.

24:09.505 --> 24:12.975
Alistair Peck has conceived
of some extraordinary theories

24:13.042 --> 24:15.677
and is possibly implementing them.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.679
Meaning what?

24:17.747 --> 24:20.816
He may well be able
to travel through time.

24:20.884 --> 24:22.784
Conceivably.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.620
Einstein himself theorized this.

24:24.687 --> 24:28.523
10:00 a.m... 11:00 a.m.

24:28.591 --> 24:30.626
He said that if something

24:30.693 --> 24:34.463
could propel an object faster
than the speed of light,

24:34.530 --> 24:36.698
then time would appear to bend.

24:39.235 --> 24:42.604
When those two folds connect,

24:42.672 --> 24:48.677
a tremendous amount of energy
is required to absorb the jump.

24:48.745 --> 24:49.878
From any power source.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.313
So the laptops, the phones...

24:51.381 --> 24:52.681
and anyone who was near him.

24:52.749 --> 24:54.283
Yes.

24:54.350 --> 24:55.484
Then what you're saying, Walter, is that

24:55.551 --> 24:57.319
Peck's moving through time is what killed

24:57.387 --> 24:58.687
all of these people on the train.

24:58.755 --> 25:01.790
That is my theory, yes,
and Olivia, if it is right,

25:01.858 --> 25:04.893
then we may well have
apprehended this man already.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.429
Possibly several times.

25:07.497 --> 25:08.697
I found his fiancée.

25:08.765 --> 25:11.266
The car in one of the photo album pictures

25:11.334 --> 25:13.402
is registered to an Arlette Turling.

25:13.469 --> 25:14.970
Her license information is coming through.

25:15.038 --> 25:16.505
Okay, that's her. Find
out whatever you can.

25:16.572 --> 25:18.473
She's our only connection to Peck.

25:18.541 --> 25:20.309
Third volume is unfinished.

25:20.376 --> 25:23.078
There's a handwritten segment at the back,

25:23.146 --> 25:25.080
then the writing stops.

25:25.148 --> 25:28.450
The unfinished chapter is entitled

25:28.518 --> 25:31.887
"achieving the Arlette principle."

25:31.955 --> 25:33.822
What'd you just say?

25:33.890 --> 25:35.991
"Achieving the Arlette principle."

25:38.995 --> 25:41.029
I think I know why Peck is doing this.

25:41.097 --> 25:45.634
Arlette Turling was killed in
a car accident ten months ago.

25:45.702 --> 25:47.202
On the 18th of May.

25:47.270 --> 25:51.306
What if Alistair Peck is
going back to save her?

25:54.744 --> 25:58.313
Grief can drive people
to extraordinary lengths.

26:05.855 --> 26:09.458
Now, considering the amount
of energy that was drawn

26:09.525 --> 26:11.059
when he landed at the
station this morning,

26:11.127 --> 26:13.328
using Peck's own theories,

26:13.396 --> 26:16.832
I estimate that we witnessed
just a 12-hour jump.

26:16.899 --> 26:20.502
10-month jump...

26:20.570 --> 26:22.270
The results would be devastating.

26:22.338 --> 26:24.139
Well, how many casualties?

26:24.207 --> 26:28.076
It would depend where he landed.

26:28.144 --> 26:29.911
Hundreds.

26:36.919 --> 26:38.186
This is weird.

26:38.254 --> 26:40.489
I did a search for Peck's cell phone

26:40.556 --> 26:42.591
when we first I.D.'d him as a suspect.

26:42.658 --> 26:43.992
He didn't have one,

26:44.060 --> 26:47.229
but Arlette Turling's
number is still active.

26:47.296 --> 26:49.598
Someone's paying the bill.

26:49.665 --> 26:51.099
Now, in the past 24 hours,

26:51.167 --> 26:52.734
the primary cell tower that's been

26:52.802 --> 26:54.703
handling the signal
from Arlette's cell phone

26:54.771 --> 26:58.173
is a tower near Albany Street.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.975
Well, what's near Albany street?

27:00.043 --> 27:01.810
M.I.T.

27:01.878 --> 27:03.111
Well, what's he doing at M.I.T?

27:03.179 --> 27:05.447
The professor said that she
hadn't seen him for almost a year.

27:05.515 --> 27:07.482
Well, Walter has a lab here,

27:07.550 --> 27:09.985
maybe Peck has a lab there.

27:15.591 --> 27:16.792
According to the files,

27:16.859 --> 27:20.095
the lab registered to Peck when he
was a professor here was lab 107.

27:20.163 --> 27:22.931
Are there any windows in that lab?

27:22.999 --> 27:25.500
Get your men on the rooftops.

27:25.568 --> 27:28.170
Are those guns really necessary?

27:28.237 --> 27:29.204
You okay?

27:29.272 --> 27:30.272
Want me to take you back home?

27:30.339 --> 27:32.340
No, just stay there.

27:32.408 --> 27:33.341
Agent Broyles...

27:33.409 --> 27:34.476
Agent Dunham.

27:34.544 --> 27:36.344
If we are correct,

27:36.412 --> 27:37.879
and, for Peck, this is about

27:37.947 --> 27:39.448
bringing a dead loved one back to life,

27:39.515 --> 27:42.617
then Peck and I, we
have something in common.

27:42.685 --> 27:44.086
Let me speak to him.

27:44.153 --> 27:45.187
Walter, I...

27:45.254 --> 27:47.889
of course I know that killing
him is the only way to ensure

27:47.957 --> 27:49.291
that he won't jump, but if I could

27:49.358 --> 27:57.332
talk to him, I think I can
convince him to stop this.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.634
Please.

28:01.237 --> 28:03.071
Let's talk to Broyles.

28:06.909 --> 28:14.950
* *

28:31.901 --> 28:32.834
Wait.

28:32.902 --> 28:34.569
I am not a threat.

28:34.637 --> 28:36.471
I am an ambassador.

28:39.509 --> 28:41.743
I know who you are.

28:41.811 --> 28:44.946
You're Dr. Walter Bishop. I've read you.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.749
New frontiers in genetic hybridization.

28:47.817 --> 28:51.953
And I know that if you wanted to,

28:52.021 --> 28:54.289
you could disappear from here in a second.

28:56.292 --> 28:59.461
Please, trust me.

29:06.525 --> 29:08.326
We take for granted...

29:08.393 --> 29:09.994
the laws of nature for example...

29:10.062 --> 29:13.531
that are not necessarily binding.

29:13.599 --> 29:15.333
There are places on this earth

29:15.400 --> 29:19.871
where two plus two most
definitely does not equal four.

29:19.938 --> 29:22.006
You've figured out how to bend time.

29:22.074 --> 29:25.843
But you're only interested
in traveling to the past.

29:25.911 --> 29:30.715
Your goal, your next
jump is the 18th of May.

29:30.782 --> 29:33.084
So you know.

29:33.151 --> 29:35.086
The 18th of May.

29:35.153 --> 29:37.388
Yes.

29:37.456 --> 29:38.823
Don't do that! Don't stand there!

29:38.891 --> 29:40.258
There are snipers outside.

29:40.325 --> 29:43.327
Stay away from the window!

29:43.395 --> 29:45.863
I hope he knows what he's doing.

29:45.931 --> 29:47.798
Why are you here?

29:47.866 --> 29:51.669
What do you really want?

29:51.737 --> 29:53.004
My calculations show

29:53.071 --> 29:55.306
what you must already know.

29:55.374 --> 29:57.808
An enormous amount of
energy will be drained

29:57.876 --> 29:59.710
from wherever you arrive

29:59.778 --> 30:02.713
and a large number of
people will be killed.

30:02.781 --> 30:05.416
But each jump back clears that slate.

30:05.484 --> 30:06.417
No.

30:06.485 --> 30:08.753
If you are reunited with your fiancée

30:08.820 --> 30:13.724
and you pull her from that
car, the victims of this last

30:13.792 --> 30:18.262
massive reset will remain dead.

30:18.330 --> 30:20.197
Listen.

30:25.804 --> 30:29.006
On the day of the crash, we argued.

30:29.074 --> 30:30.908
Arlette wanted me to go to some store

30:30.976 --> 30:32.777
to register for wedding gifts,

30:32.844 --> 30:35.846
and I hurt her feelings and I left.

30:35.914 --> 30:39.150
As I walked, I became drawn
to something on the horizon.

30:39.217 --> 30:42.320
A large, red ball.

30:42.387 --> 30:44.422
It was a hot air balloon.

30:44.489 --> 30:48.426
Moored on the city's
outskirts, out in this field.

30:48.493 --> 30:50.494
I spent the whole day in this field,

30:50.562 --> 30:54.632
looking at this balloon,
and I got my answer.

30:54.700 --> 31:01.872
I had an epiphany of how to physically
apply my theories of time travel.

31:01.940 --> 31:07.378
I was in that field the
moment her car was hit.

31:07.446 --> 31:11.482
18 may, 2:18 p.m.

31:11.550 --> 31:13.451
If I'd have simply done what she asked me,

31:13.518 --> 31:17.321
if I'd have said,
"sure, I'll go with you,"

31:17.389 --> 31:22.059
I know it wouldn't have happened.

31:22.127 --> 31:23.894
I will jump back.

31:23.962 --> 31:25.630
But I'll jump back

31:25.697 --> 31:27.064
into that empty field, Walter.

31:27.132 --> 31:30.701
And I'll only drain the
energy from the plant life.

31:30.769 --> 31:33.070
Energy will be dispersed, no one will die,

31:33.138 --> 31:38.242
and I will pull Arlette from
that car and I will save her life.

31:38.310 --> 31:46.317
I know why you haven't
gone back to May 18th, yet.

31:46.385 --> 31:48.252
Because you don't know how to.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.988
You haven't been able to jump back

31:51.056 --> 31:53.858
any further than the train.

32:02.701 --> 32:04.769
What happened?

32:04.836 --> 32:08.139
Someone get that signal back online!

32:08.206 --> 32:11.709
You approximate the time curvature

32:11.777 --> 32:15.613
using a seventh order polynomial.

32:15.681 --> 32:17.982
But you made one small error.

32:18.050 --> 32:23.621
For the distance you require,
it should be at least nine.

32:23.689 --> 32:25.723
I've read you too.

32:31.196 --> 32:32.697
Get a team up there, now.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.434
I'm telling you how to do this,

32:36.501 --> 32:38.202
but I'm telling you you cannot do it.

32:38.270 --> 32:39.570
I must do it.

32:39.638 --> 32:41.706
You'll never be able to
live with the consequences.

32:41.773 --> 32:42.907
I told you, no one will die.

32:42.974 --> 32:44.608
That's not the consequences

32:44.676 --> 32:47.211
I'm talking about.

32:47.279 --> 32:53.851
I, too, attempted the
unimaginable, and I succeeded.

32:53.919 --> 32:58.022
I crossed into another universe,

32:58.090 --> 33:00.891
and took a son that wasn't mine.

33:00.959 --> 33:02.727
And since then, not a day has passed

33:02.794 --> 33:05.830
without me feeling the burden of that act.

33:11.103 --> 33:15.439
I'm going to tell you something

33:15.507 --> 33:17.675
that I have never told another soul.

33:22.614 --> 33:28.319
Until I took my son from the other side,

33:28.386 --> 33:33.023
I had never believed in God.

33:33.091 --> 33:35.359
But it occurred to me...

33:35.427 --> 33:38.763
That my actions had betrayed him

33:38.830 --> 33:42.032
and that everything that
had happened to me since

33:42.100 --> 33:45.703
was God punishing me.

33:45.771 --> 33:51.075
So now I'm looking for
a sign of forgiveness.

33:51.143 --> 33:56.147
I've asked God for a sign of forgiveness.

33:56.214 --> 33:59.683
A specific one, a white tulip.

33:59.751 --> 34:03.387
Tulips don't bloom this time
of year... white or otherwise.

34:03.455 --> 34:07.992
But he's God.

34:08.059 --> 34:14.297
And if God can forgive me
for my acts then maybe...

34:14.366 --> 34:17.434
It's in the realm of possibility

34:17.502 --> 34:23.440
that my son, possibly, may
be able to forgive me too.

34:23.507 --> 34:27.578
Walter, God is science.

34:27.646 --> 34:31.248
God is polio and flu vaccines

34:31.315 --> 34:35.820
and MRI machines, and artificial hearts.

34:35.887 --> 34:37.087
If you are a man of science,

34:37.155 --> 34:40.858
then that's the only faith we need.

34:43.360 --> 34:48.299
Then allow me to serve
as a precautionary tale.

34:48.366 --> 34:50.534
There will be repercussions

34:50.601 --> 34:54.471
if you pull Arlette from that car.

34:54.539 --> 34:55.873
You don't know how things will be changed

34:55.940 --> 34:58.509
by your actions, but they will.

34:58.577 --> 35:01.879
It's not our place to adjust the universe.

35:01.947 --> 35:03.080
And you will never be able

35:03.148 --> 35:05.182
to look at her again without knowing that,

35:05.250 --> 35:10.754
just like every time I look at my son.

35:10.822 --> 35:14.425
I have traveled through
madness to figure this out.

35:14.492 --> 35:16.327
And you will too.

35:22.801 --> 35:26.370
You're asking me to just leave her there.

35:34.813 --> 35:35.980
No, no, no! Stop!

35:36.047 --> 35:37.448
I'm all right.

35:37.515 --> 35:39.416
Stop! No, please!

35:39.484 --> 35:40.484
Gentlemen, please!

35:40.552 --> 35:41.852
Don't you see?

35:41.920 --> 35:43.153
We won't remember this.

35:43.221 --> 35:44.455
Don't you see? We won't remember anything.

35:44.522 --> 35:45.689
We won't remember!

36:07.086 --> 36:08.386
This is weird.

36:08.454 --> 36:10.622
I did a search for Peck's cell phone

36:10.689 --> 36:12.991
when we first I.D.'d him as a suspect.

36:13.058 --> 36:14.425
He didn't have one.

36:14.493 --> 36:17.095
But Arlette Turling's
number is still active.

36:17.162 --> 36:19.364
Now in the past 24 hours,
the primary cell tower

36:19.431 --> 36:20.698
that's been handling the signal

36:20.766 --> 36:23.301
is a tower near...

36:23.369 --> 36:24.669
Albany street.

36:25.738 --> 36:26.838
Dunham.

36:26.905 --> 36:29.207
Alistair Peck is back at his residence.

36:29.275 --> 36:31.809
Six dead, including two
Boston P. D. officers.

36:31.877 --> 36:35.613
We have to take him down
before he jumps again.

37:43.248 --> 37:44.749
Take it.

39:39.698 --> 39:41.432
I haven't seen you look
at that letter for a while.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.601
It's been almost a year
since Alistair died.

39:43.669 --> 39:46.637
Today's the day I'm supposed to send it.

39:46.705 --> 39:49.974
Open it.

39:50.042 --> 39:51.976
Apparently, Alistair felt whatever it is,

39:52.044 --> 39:55.379
he could put in your trust.

39:55.447 --> 39:58.883
He wouldn't have sealed it if he
wanted me to see what's inside.

41:25.437 --> 41:26.537
Walter?

41:26.605 --> 41:29.974
Hey, I got you something.

41:30.042 --> 41:33.978
Fixed your turntable.

41:34.046 --> 41:35.580
I'd tell you to keep it
out of the lab this time,

41:35.647 --> 41:36.948
but I know you won't.

41:37.015 --> 41:38.549
Thank you, Peter.

41:38.617 --> 41:40.918
I thought maybe you'd like
some music to cheer you up.

41:45.190 --> 41:46.557
Walter, I know that you've been in a funk

41:46.625 --> 41:48.392
for the last couple of weeks.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.661
If there's something you
want to talk to me about...

41:50.729 --> 41:54.999
No.

41:55.067 --> 41:57.702
Something was weighing on me,

41:57.769 --> 41:59.870
a decision, but...

41:59.938 --> 42:02.807
I'm fine.

42:02.874 --> 42:05.443
Okay.

42:05.510 --> 42:07.211
I'm gonna go hit the hay.
