WEBVTT

00:05.657 --> 00:07.442
[Jughead]
Everything has shifted.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.139
There was an explosion
at Archie's house

00:09.183 --> 00:10.706
and I lost my ability to hear.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.145
Some things
I could do as before.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.408
Read, eat hamburgers,
kiss Tabitha.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.107
But there are other things

00:20.150 --> 00:22.631
that I may never be able
to do again.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.720
The fact of the matter is,
my world shattered.

00:29.159 --> 00:32.032
The question now was
how do I rebuild?

00:32.075 --> 00:33.468
All right, guys, listen up.

00:33.511 --> 00:34.773
Frank and I have reinforced

00:34.817 --> 00:36.036
the infrastructure
of the house,

00:36.079 --> 00:37.341
so it's safe to work.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.169
But please,
keep your helmets on.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.345
Let's have
a good productive shift, okay?

00:43.913 --> 00:45.306
[Betty] So much for
your safety meeting.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.698
Keep going.

00:46.742 --> 00:47.960
I'm already going.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.962
[chuckling] Well, go harder.

00:50.006 --> 00:53.488
[laughs] I'm pressing
as hard as I can.

00:53.531 --> 00:56.099
[grunts] My God.
You don't feel it at all?

00:56.143 --> 00:58.101
No. Nothing.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.059
Not one bit.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.540
Okay, well, it's confirmed.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.716
You're still invulnerable.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.023
Well, Betty, I don't know
what happened to us
in that explosion,

01:07.067 --> 01:09.939
but all of my childhood dreams
about becoming a superhero

01:09.982 --> 01:12.550
are somehow... coming true.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.857
Mmm-hmm.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.033
Have you talked to Jughead
about any of this?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.817
He was third closest
to the explosion.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.906
Fourth closest.
Don't forget Bingo.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.908
Who's driving my mother crazy.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.128
No. Yeah, I just left Jughead
a couple of messages.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.173
He hasn't answered me.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.304
I'll check up on him.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.393
A little later.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.091
Okay.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.138
Grand Mistress Rose.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.401
I just had
the strangest encounter

01:37.445 --> 01:38.968
with Master Cheryl upstairs.

01:39.011 --> 01:42.102
She seemed...
less like herself than usual.

01:42.145 --> 01:47.368
That's because I transferred
Abigail's soul from your body

01:47.411 --> 01:51.502
into my granddaughter's,
via an arcane ritual.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.722
But where did
Mistress Cheryl's soul go?

01:53.765 --> 01:57.726
Oh, once untethered,
it dissipated into the ether.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.859
Into nothingness.

02:00.903 --> 02:04.080
There is
no more Cheryl Blossom.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.866
There is only... [sighs]

02:07.910 --> 02:09.129
Abigail.

02:12.001 --> 02:16.092
Roseanne, do all the ladies
dress like harlots these days?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.443
Indeed, we live
in fallen times.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.664
That is why
I brought you back, Abigail.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.318
To lift us up.

02:24.361 --> 02:28.235
To restore the Blossom family
to our former glory.

02:28.278 --> 02:31.107
And how, pray tell,
am I meant to do that?

02:31.151 --> 02:34.415
Riverdale once belonged
to the Blossoms.

02:36.547 --> 02:40.160
I think it's time
we took it back, don't you?

02:40.203 --> 02:41.770
Of course.

02:41.813 --> 02:44.860
I should like to get
a lay of the land first.

02:44.903 --> 02:48.298
Well, the town is governed,
inaptly I might add,

02:48.342 --> 02:50.170
by a Council of Four.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.389
We'll start there.

02:52.433 --> 02:55.610
[tense music rises]

03:00.049 --> 03:03.139
[Jughead] Archie just found out
that I lost my ability to hear.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.663
Then he asked me
a curious question.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.232
He wants to know if anything
weird happened to me

03:09.276 --> 03:10.929
after the explosion.

03:10.973 --> 03:14.237
"You mean beside
losing my hearing?", I say.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.196
"Why do you ask?"

03:16.239 --> 03:17.458
"Just curious", he says.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.896
I'm not sure I believe him.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.167
[Veronica] Reggie, I need
to tell you something.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.126
Okay.

03:34.170 --> 03:38.261
Three days ago,
my father's body was found

03:38.305 --> 03:41.264
in a shallow grave
in the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.048
What? How'd he die?

03:43.092 --> 03:46.269
His hands were zip-tied,

03:46.313 --> 03:50.317
and he'd been shot four times
in the back of the head.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.232
His body was then burned.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.320
Could it be a fake-out?

03:53.363 --> 03:54.321
No, Reggie.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.281
He's dead.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.543
I'm sure he's dead.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.767
Wait. You lied to me.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.900
You told me
you called off the hit.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.598
I... I didn't want to
be judged.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.861
In what universe.
am I not supposed to judge you?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.341
Well...

04:14.384 --> 04:16.081
Brace yourself
because there's more.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.868
We are hosting
a memorial service

04:19.911 --> 04:22.000
for my father
right here at the casino.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.741
-[exhales]
-My grandmother is coming.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.222
Some of my father's associates,
my mom.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.745
Does your mom and grandma
know the truth?

04:27.789 --> 04:28.877
No.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.708
I may tell my mom, but...
[inhales deeply]

04:33.751 --> 04:35.971
Not Abuelita.
She'd never forgive me.

04:36.014 --> 04:39.235
Copy. So, should I...

04:39.279 --> 04:41.368
say I'm sorry for your loss
or congratulations?

04:45.372 --> 04:46.851
I don't know, Reggie.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.769
I just don't know.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.336
[Kevin] The long and short
of it is

04:53.380 --> 04:55.599
I'm staying to take care
of Baby Anthony.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.341
And I was... I was thinking,

04:58.385 --> 05:01.257
if I'm gonna be in town
for a while longer...

05:01.301 --> 05:03.259
Maybe I'll take you up on
your offer to be your deputy.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.348
I'd love that.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.784
You sure that's something
that you want to do?

05:06.828 --> 05:09.396
Yeah, I do.

05:09.439 --> 05:12.050
Well, in that case,
I would be honored.

05:12.094 --> 05:13.400
Yeah.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.662
All right. Thanks, Dad.
Hey, cheers.

05:15.663 --> 05:16.794
To my new deputy.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.581
Poor Jug.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.147
[munching] Yeah.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.627
Well, at least
he's got Tabitha.

05:23.671 --> 05:27.457
-[continues munching]
-[phone trilling]

05:27.501 --> 05:29.198
-Hello.
-[Agent Lin on phone]
Agent Cooper.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.895
I wanted to let you know ASAP.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.028
Glen's car was found
outside Pop's diner.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.638
And where's Glen?

05:34.682 --> 05:36.379
[Agent Lin] No one's
heard from him

05:36.423 --> 05:37.119
since he was supposed to
be leaving Riverdale.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.864
[clicks tongue] Okay. Thanks
for letting me know, Agent Lin.

05:42.907 --> 05:43.865
I'll be in soon.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.476
[phone beeps]

05:46.520 --> 05:47.782
That's weird.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.958
Glen's MIA.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.264
[Veronica] Abuelita.
How are you holding up?

05:52.308 --> 05:54.310
[speaks Spanish]

05:54.354 --> 05:55.964
What a tragedy upon your papa.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.922
I know it's awful.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.924
Your father and his business.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.622
I knew it would end up
this way.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.928
In bloodshed, one dark night.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.931
[inhales, sighs]

06:06.975 --> 06:08.846
Veronica, I would like to

06:08.890 --> 06:11.762
introduce you to Heraldo,
my godson.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.155
He takes good care of me.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.374
Nice to meet you, Heraldo.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.897
Pleased to meet you.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.638
Abuelita,I'd like you to meet

06:17.681 --> 06:22.773
my business partner and...
boyfriend, Reginald Mantle.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.601
It's a pleasure
and an honor, ma'am.

06:24.645 --> 06:25.559
[speaks Spanish]

06:26.560 --> 06:29.040
It's very good to meet you.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.215
Can I give this to you?

06:30.259 --> 06:31.391
It's a guest list
for the funeral.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.351
Is there anything else
you want me to do?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.659
Si,your abuelitahas requested
that you deliver the eulogy.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.356
No. I...

06:41.792 --> 06:43.098
I wouldn't know what to say.

06:43.141 --> 06:46.231
Who will be better
than you, Nieta?

06:46.275 --> 06:47.929
Your papiloved you so much.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.585
Please, do this for me.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.942
[Jughead] I told Tabitha
what the ENT doctor said,

07:00.985 --> 07:02.726
that I had to wait
at least six months

07:02.770 --> 07:04.336
before getting an implant.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.426
Then she asked me
about learning ASL.

07:06.469 --> 07:09.080
I told her I wouldn't need ASL
once I got the implants.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.607
Then she asked me
if I wrote today.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.218
I told her that I always
listen to music when I write,

07:16.261 --> 07:19.134
and when I tried to write
without it today, I just...

07:19.177 --> 07:22.137
I couldn't hear the clack
of my keyboard's keys.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.574
Everything about writing
suddenly became alien to me.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.186
I told her
there's nothing she could do,

07:28.230 --> 07:30.667
that somehow we just have to
get through this.

07:39.676 --> 07:44.681
[high-pitched buzzing]

07:44.725 --> 07:46.683
Everything all right,
Agent Cooper?

07:46.727 --> 07:48.032
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.034
Just have, like,
a brutal headache

07:50.078 --> 07:51.471
directly behind my eyes.

07:53.124 --> 07:53.951
Sounds like a migraine.

07:55.692 --> 07:58.390
I've never
had migraines before.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.175
Also this came for you today.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.219
Thank you.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.990
Now we'd like
to open up the floor

08:33.034 --> 08:35.123
to all members
of the community.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.604
[Tabitha] Oh.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.563
Why, that must be some relation
to Archibald Andrews.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.869
Can I get an extension
on the permit

08:41.912 --> 08:42.957
for the dumpsters
in front of house?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.307
Permission granted, Archie.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.439
Uh, who's next?

08:47.483 --> 08:49.267
I have an announcement.

08:52.314 --> 08:56.231
My father, Hiram Lodge...
is dead.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.450
[crowd murmuring]

08:58.494 --> 09:02.890
He died under mysterious,
violent circumstances.

09:02.933 --> 09:03.847
I'm fine.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.067
But please rejoice.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.113
Riverdale's Big Bad will be
tormenting us no longer.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.379
Any other announcements?

09:17.121 --> 09:18.383
Hello.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.081
Uh, my name
is Percival Pickens.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.517
I recently moved to Riverdale,

09:21.561 --> 09:23.519
and I just wanted you all
to know...

09:24.825 --> 09:26.653
how excited I am

09:26.696 --> 09:28.176
to be joining your community.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.613
Pickens.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.572
In the earliest of early days,

09:32.615 --> 09:33.921
did we Blossoms not have

09:33.964 --> 09:35.662
a fellowship
with the Pickens family?

09:35.705 --> 09:38.839
Yes. And it did not end well.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.232
Welcome, Percival.

09:41.276 --> 09:45.193
By any chance, are you related
to General Augustus Pickens?

09:45.236 --> 09:46.586
[chuckles] Oh.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.196
Goodness. Yes, but, uh,
don't worry.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.677
I'm... I'm not here
to cause trouble.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.157
I simply believe that
with a little bit of luck

09:53.201 --> 09:54.637
and some hard work,

09:54.681 --> 09:56.639
Riverdale could become
one of the greatest

09:56.683 --> 09:59.294
and most-prosperous communities
in America.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.904
Now, I have lots of ideas

10:00.948 --> 10:02.514
I'd be happy to share
with the council.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.039
Starting with the removal...

10:05.082 --> 10:07.432
Sorry. So sorry I'm late.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.303
[gasps softly]

10:10.522 --> 10:11.828
I was busy trying to stop

10:11.872 --> 10:13.569
a gang war from erupting
on the streets,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.266
but what else is new, right?

10:15.310 --> 10:17.747
Why, that is the spitting image
of my beloved Thomasina.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.445
That's Miss Topaz. Toni Topaz.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.404
Topaz?

10:22.447 --> 10:25.363
That was my paramour's surname.

10:25.407 --> 10:28.584
You must tell me everything
about this Toni Topaz.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.812
[Jughead] Tabitha was
at a town hall meeting.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.684
I didn't go.
I couldn't face people's pity.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.643
So I stayed home
and tried to write,

10:43.686 --> 10:46.384
but again, nothing came to me.

10:51.607 --> 10:57.178
And then... suddenly I knew
exactly what I wanted to do.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.963
Hey, how you doin'? Really.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.010
I'm okay.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.751
I mean, after all,
it wasn't too long ago

11:04.794 --> 11:08.580
you and I were in your car
plotting to take Daddy out

11:08.624 --> 11:10.844
in a similarly gruesome manner.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.585
We were angry.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.023
It's not like we actually would
have gone through with it.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.941
I guess we'll never know.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.333
[Abigail] All right, Britannia.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.684
Wherefore does this Toni
spent her days?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.034
Miss Topaz
works at Riverdale High.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.731
She's our guidance counselor

11:28.775 --> 11:31.342
and she teaches
the history of social justice.

11:31.386 --> 11:34.606
Fittingly, yes. Thomasina was
a teacher as well.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.826
And this Riverdale High,

11:36.870 --> 11:38.393
-that's a school?
-Exactly.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.570
You will take me
there tomorrow.

11:41.613 --> 11:46.053
And you, little lamb,
will be my Trojan horse.

11:46.096 --> 11:49.926
But tell me, why were Tony
and Cheryl torn asunder?

11:49.970 --> 11:52.146
To be honest, I don't know.

11:52.189 --> 11:55.889
And they were together
as two women out in the open?

11:56.628 --> 11:57.673
Yes.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.633
What a brave new world this is.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.247
[Archie] This is insane, Betty.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.771
Now TBK is in Riverdale
and he murdered Glen.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.294
No, I don't think
he killed Glen.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.775
I think he's keeping him
alive somewhere.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.691
Dismembering him
piece by piece.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.258
What makes you think that?

12:17.301 --> 12:18.738
Because that's his
preferred method of killing.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.522
Slowly.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.872
So it takes days, if not weeks,

12:22.916 --> 12:25.135
so they suffer.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.963
But you don't think
he's going to come after you?

12:27.007 --> 12:30.358
I don't know. But if he does,
even without a mask,

12:30.401 --> 12:34.318
I should be able to see
his aura if it's a threat,

12:34.362 --> 12:36.407
like I did with Glen
and the orderly right?

12:36.451 --> 12:39.149
[sighs] I'm more worried about
everyone else in Riverdale.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.325
I'll have my mom
spread the word on RIVW.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.632
And I'll have my team
out on the streets

12:43.675 --> 12:44.764
canvassing the neighborhoods.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.379
[Jughead] I couldn't hear
what Tabitha was saying,

12:51.422 --> 12:53.468
but I knew
she was pissed at me,

12:53.511 --> 12:55.296
as well as
she should have been.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.385
I took my motorcycle
out for a ride.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.691
Sure enough, I wiped out.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.827
But how could I tell Tabitha
that for those brief moments

13:04.871 --> 13:08.570
when I was cruising,
all was right in the world?

13:08.613 --> 13:11.181
We're getting the word out
through local media and social,

13:11.225 --> 13:13.749
but more than 50%
of TBK's victims

13:13.793 --> 13:15.795
are from
historically disenfranchised

13:15.838 --> 13:17.797
vulnerable communities.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.364
He preys on the unhoused
because no one misses them.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.801
So we're gonna focus on

13:21.844 --> 13:24.151
those neighborhoods
with these flyers.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.761
To anyone
you come in contact with,

13:25.805 --> 13:28.459
tell them if they see TBK,
do not approach him.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.897
Call us
and we'll take it from there.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.246
I'll hit Sketch Alley,

13:32.289 --> 13:33.334
Agent Lin's
got your assignments.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.859
Okay. You're gonna
come with me...

13:38.905 --> 13:40.863
-Veronica Lodge?
-Yes. How can I help you?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.865
This is a release that states
you're okay with us

13:42.909 --> 13:44.998
filming you and using
your likeness on television.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.391
Oh, right. Sure.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.263
[scribbling]

13:50.046 --> 13:50.873
All right.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.311
Oh. Okay.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.836
Okay. If you can just
take a step towards me,

13:56.879 --> 13:58.489
find your light.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.187
Perfect.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.753
All right, let's bring her in.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.017
[gaps] Baby.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.454
Oh. It's okay.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.455
I'm here. Let it out.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.152
Mommy is here.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.372
Hi, Mom.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.292
[saw whirring]

14:20.207 --> 14:21.817
Hey, boss.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.036
Found this while I was
clearing out the basement.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.691
Holy crap.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.346
You know what this is, right?

14:29.390 --> 14:30.608
No.

14:30.652 --> 14:31.740
Palladium.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.350
I got to keep a couple pieces

14:33.394 --> 14:34.569
after I did all that mining
for Cheryl Blossom.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.920
It's worth
a hefty chunk of change.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.096
Hey, as a reward
for finding it,

14:40.140 --> 14:41.141
I'll split it with you.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.621
No, I couldn't. It's yours.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.710
I'll tell you what.
If you find the other piece,

14:45.754 --> 14:46.929
you can keep that one.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.148
Break time, people.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.758
Alice has coffee brewing
next door.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.633
[Alice sighs]
Freshly brewed coffee.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.374
[Bingo grunting]

14:57.418 --> 14:59.768
Bingo, down.
Get down, get down.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.684
Oh.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.686
Archie, how the hell
are you drinking that?

15:04.729 --> 15:05.817
Isn't that too hot?

15:09.212 --> 15:11.823
Yeah, yeah. Yes, it's hot.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.651
It's really hot.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.697
So talk to me, Cheryl.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.004
You said that you need
some help with Britta.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.006
I would like to
formally adopt her.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.703
Well, great.

15:21.746 --> 15:22.922
Um, but, Cheryl...

15:23.748 --> 15:25.054
there's a bunch of hoops

15:25.098 --> 15:26.012
we're going to have to
jump through.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.057
Well, Antoinette,

15:28.101 --> 15:30.190
why don't you come by
Thornhill this eventide

15:30.233 --> 15:32.496
and walk me through
those steps?

15:32.540 --> 15:34.977
Slowly and methodically.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.632
Actually, I'm going to
be bartending

15:37.675 --> 15:39.373
at the Whyte Wyrm tonight.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.765
In that case,

15:40.809 --> 15:43.072
perchance I will pay you
a visit instead.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.949
By the way,
thank you so much for
inviting me, Hermione.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.472
Oh, not at all, Kevin.

15:51.515 --> 15:52.995
I know you're a super fan.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.824
And this is going to be
an extra special episode

15:55.867 --> 15:57.304
of reality television.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.219
All about how Veronica and I
are dealing

15:59.262 --> 16:01.699
with the emotional fallout
of Hiram's tragic death.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.527
Wait, is that what
we're doing here?

16:03.571 --> 16:06.704
Don't worry, honey.
I'll guide you through it.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.489
Do you remember where you were

16:08.532 --> 16:12.101
when you first heard the news
of Hiram's tragic death?

16:12.145 --> 16:14.451
Mom, I'm not gonna
reduce my feelings

16:14.495 --> 16:15.757
to sound bites for your show.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.150
How did you feel
when Daddy died?

16:17.193 --> 16:19.326
-Did you cry?
-Nope.

16:19.369 --> 16:22.894
Because the man I loved
died many years ago.

16:22.938 --> 16:26.463
I cried when I mourned
the death of my marriage.

16:26.507 --> 16:31.338
But I am through shedding tears
for that man.

16:31.381 --> 16:36.169
All right. Kevin, Abuelita,
Heraldo, camera crew,

16:36.212 --> 16:37.909
please clear the room.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.737
I need to talk to my mom.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.087
Alone.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.006
[Hermione] Veronica,
what is it, sweetheart?

16:50.618 --> 16:52.446
It was me.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.361
I put it bounty
on Daddy's head.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.624
I'm the reason he died.

16:59.409 --> 17:00.280
You know what...

17:01.933 --> 17:04.197
I sort of suspected.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.068
When I heard
how your father was found,

17:06.112 --> 17:08.157
I thought,
"What if Veronica was the one

17:08.201 --> 17:09.637
who finally did it?"

17:09.680 --> 17:11.595
-His favorite partner.
-What do you mean?

17:11.639 --> 17:15.382
I don't like admitting this,
but...

17:15.425 --> 17:20.082
Sometimes I was
a little jealous of you two.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.258
I mean, the special
relationship that you two had?

17:22.302 --> 17:25.174
I always knew that he loved you
more than he loved me.

17:25.218 --> 17:28.221
I just... I was afraid that
the same was true of you.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.745
You loved him
more than you loved me.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.094
No.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.444
After all he did,
Daddy infuriated me.

17:34.488 --> 17:37.360
Exactly. And he had all of
your attention because of it.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.406
Do you know that the happiest
I ever was

17:39.449 --> 17:41.060
was when it was just us
living in this apartment?

17:41.103 --> 17:43.497
Just us Lodge women
together against the world.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.762
And then your father came home,

17:47.805 --> 17:51.026
and it was Hiram
and his best girl.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.375
That was you, Veronica.

17:54.029 --> 17:57.076
Not me. [sniffles] Never me.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.993
I'm so sorry, Mom.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.387
I was so caught up in
drama with Daddy

18:04.431 --> 18:06.259
that I wasn't a good daughter
to you.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.437
But I want to be one now.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.788
Honey...

18:13.831 --> 18:15.485
I can't tell you how happy
it makes me

18:15.529 --> 18:16.486
to hear you say that.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.531
[exhales]

18:17.574 --> 18:19.620
There's nothing I want more.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.069
[floorboards creaking]

18:40.119 --> 18:41.468
[groans, coughs]

18:47.300 --> 18:48.649
[moans]

18:56.265 --> 18:58.963
[Jughead] Tabitha found him.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.706
Like me, Daniel experienced
late-life deafness.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.145
He learned a sign and read lips
in his 20s.

19:06.188 --> 19:09.191
Now he helps people
on journeys similar to his own.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.410
He wanted to help me.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.114
I nodded "yes,"

19:19.158 --> 19:21.769
and we made an appointment
for me to go to his office.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.478
[TBK] Hello, pretty Betty.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.567
[gasps]

19:37.611 --> 19:39.961
Working late, I see.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.702
How did you get in here?

19:41.745 --> 19:43.182
Glen's access card.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.360
Glen. Is he still...

19:47.403 --> 19:51.102
Yes. He's proven
extremely hardy.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.931
Why are you here?

19:53.975 --> 19:55.455
I came after reading

19:55.498 --> 19:58.371
you were nearly killed
in an explosion.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.286
[cell phone ringing]

20:00.329 --> 20:03.376
[TBK] You and Archie
are getting close.

20:03.419 --> 20:06.248
Don't make me
go after him next.

20:06.292 --> 20:10.731
Try it. He'll kick your ass.
And so will I.

20:10.774 --> 20:12.080
Get out of here.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.603
Oh.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.476
Betty, I've missed this.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.087
-Oh.
-[cell phone continues ringing]

20:25.006 --> 20:27.313
It's a tad tart.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.749
Might I have
some more butter in it?

20:28.792 --> 20:31.230
I don't have
any butter, Cheryl.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.970
And since when do you
drink beer, anyways?

20:33.014 --> 20:34.668
Quite right.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.105
And in truth,
I didn't come to drink.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.978
Lately, I've been thinking
about the past.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.765
My past, this town's past...

20:46.114 --> 20:49.639
-Your past.
-My past? What about it?

20:49.683 --> 20:52.512
How much do you know
about your ancestor, Thomasina?

20:52.555 --> 20:55.210
She was a great, great aunt
of mine.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.865
And, from what I can remember,
a spinster schoolmarm--

20:57.908 --> 20:59.823
That is falsehood.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.869
Thomasina lived
her life passionately

21:01.912 --> 21:04.088
and drank deeply
from the juices of the world.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.396
Until she was murdered
by a warlock-pirate.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.745
[laughs]

21:08.789 --> 21:10.269
What are you talking about?

21:10.312 --> 21:12.140
There's no such thing
as warlock-pirates.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.837
Hey, Cheryl.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.143
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.623
[straining]

21:16.666 --> 21:17.493
[gasps]

21:19.539 --> 21:22.455
Oh, I'm... sorry, Cheryl.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.108
We told Kevin,
but we just haven't

21:24.152 --> 21:25.458
got around to telling you yet.

21:26.502 --> 21:27.764
Fangs and I are together now.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.245
Together?

21:30.289 --> 21:33.901
And how did that... transpire?

21:33.944 --> 21:36.469
We've known each other
since we were kids.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.471
And after having
a baby together--

21:38.514 --> 21:39.385
A baby?

21:40.647 --> 21:43.040
Yeah. Baby Anthony, our son.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.826
Of course.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.655
And quite the cherub he is.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.484
I have to get back
to fair Britannia.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.877
A mother's work is never done,
after all.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.752
What was that about?

21:58.795 --> 22:01.450
I have no idea.

22:01.494 --> 22:04.932
But Cheryl doesn't even seem
like Cheryl to me.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.499
[Archie] I can't believe
TBK came to see you

22:06.542 --> 22:07.891
at the FBI office.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.328
But what's scaring me
most right now is

22:09.371 --> 22:11.025
I couldn't see his aura.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.376
How could he not be
a threat to me?

22:14.420 --> 22:17.597
Unless he's in
my blind spot somehow?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.555
I don't know.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.557
I keep getting
these headaches, too.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.517
It feels like someone's
taking a pickaxe to my brain.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.694
Something has been
happening to me, too.

22:27.737 --> 22:29.739
I fell through
the landing earlier.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.787
And... I got hurt, Betty.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.266
Like, my invulnerability
is fading.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.572
But what's changed?

22:38.095 --> 22:40.228
TBK might be my blind spot,

22:40.271 --> 22:42.448
but what's
your weakness, Superman?

22:43.623 --> 22:44.667
What's your kryptonite?

22:46.277 --> 22:47.366
Oh, my God.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.848
One of my guys
found this piece of palladium,

22:51.892 --> 22:53.546
and I've been carrying it
on me ever since.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.461
What if this is my kryptonite?

22:58.725 --> 23:00.161
-You take it.
-Okay.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.902
Keep it away from me.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.425
Let's see what happens
if it's not near me.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.688
Maybe I'll go back
to being indestructible

23:05.732 --> 23:07.603
Either way,

23:07.647 --> 23:10.389
you really need to be
super careful right now, Arch.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.783
TBK is a jealous serial killer.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.916
You don't need to be a hero
right now.

23:15.959 --> 23:19.049
At least not until your...
powers come back.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.671
[Jughead] So I went to
Daniel's office.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.237
I told him that
one of my biggest worries

23:33.281 --> 23:35.065
was that I'd never write again,

23:35.109 --> 23:37.067
and he said that I should sit
in his office alone

23:37.111 --> 23:40.419
for five hours, and to just
start writing down my thoughts,

23:40.462 --> 23:42.551
that it would help me get
comfortable with the silence.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.684
I said I'd do my best,

23:44.727 --> 23:46.599
and then he left me alone.

23:46.642 --> 23:47.469
[sighs]

23:49.558 --> 23:52.474
-Wow, Mom,
you really went all out.
-Mmm-mmm.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.781
Is this food I can
actually eat or are we filming?

23:54.824 --> 23:57.479
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.438
How would you feel about

23:59.481 --> 24:02.223
recreating a version
of our conversation

24:02.266 --> 24:04.225
that we had last night
on camera today?

24:04.268 --> 24:06.357
I mean, not the part about you
killing your father, of course.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.403
But the emotional part,

24:08.447 --> 24:09.752
you know, our core wound

24:09.796 --> 24:12.494
about you...
taking me for granted.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.801
But, Mom, I...

24:14.844 --> 24:17.238
I mean, all of that
was real for me.

24:17.281 --> 24:19.022
That's why I want it on camera.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.851
It was just so raw.
What do you think?

24:25.899 --> 24:26.900
-Of course.
-[sighs] Oh.

24:26.943 --> 24:28.118
-Let's do it.
-Really?

24:28.162 --> 24:29.076
Yeah.

24:29.990 --> 24:30.904
Wonderful.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.217
Mistress Abigail,
are you all right?

24:40.261 --> 24:42.742
No, Britannia.
Clearly I am not all right.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.918
I cannot fathom
that my beloved Thomasina

24:44.961 --> 24:47.398
is in love
with a descendant of...

24:47.442 --> 24:50.663
Fenn Fogarty.
Her very murderer.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.710
I'm positively bereft.

24:54.754 --> 24:57.670
Miss Topaz is dating
Fangs Fogarty?

24:57.713 --> 25:00.673
Well, I, for one, am relieved.

25:00.716 --> 25:05.112
I reincarnated you to get back
what is ours.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.592
Riverdale.

25:06.635 --> 25:10.291
Not so you can consort
with some Serpent trash.

25:16.427 --> 25:19.735
Did you just refer
to my beloved Thomasina

25:19.779 --> 25:21.389
as "Serpent trash"?

25:21.955 --> 25:23.217
I did.

25:23.260 --> 25:26.176
[thunder rumbling,
wind howling]

25:28.570 --> 25:30.267
You forget yourself, old woman.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.531
But don't worry.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.358
Abigail is here to remind you.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.796
[classical instrumental music]

25:36.839 --> 25:39.668
I will have Riverdale
back in my thrall.

25:39.712 --> 25:43.542
I will have my revenge
on the offspring of my enemies.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.587
But first...

25:45.631 --> 25:48.068
I will have Thomasina back
by my side.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.591
[scoffs]

25:49.635 --> 25:52.855
And death to anyone
who stands in my way.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.295
[door locks]

26:10.394 --> 26:12.440
[Jughead] Five hours later,
Daniel came back.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.050
[muffled thud]

26:14.094 --> 26:16.270
I hadn't written a word.

26:16.313 --> 26:20.100
"It takes time," he said,
without any trace of judgment.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.976
And then he gave me
a graphic novel to read.

26:27.020 --> 26:30.023
One he'd written and drawn
about his experiences

26:30.066 --> 26:32.721
navigating deafness.
He said it might help me.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.550
I said I would read it.

26:38.771 --> 26:39.772
[Anatol] Good evening,
Miss Lodge.

26:41.687 --> 26:42.992
Did I startle you?

26:43.036 --> 26:44.472
Anatol, what the hell
do you want?

26:44.515 --> 26:45.691
I paid you your blood money.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.388
Yes, you did.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.260
But I'm here on another job.

26:50.304 --> 26:52.306
What, to kill me?

26:52.349 --> 26:54.743
Right before
my father's funeral? Seriously?

26:54.787 --> 26:55.657
[scoffs]

26:56.615 --> 26:58.399
You American women.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.966
You think you're so tough,

27:00.009 --> 27:01.532
but you don't have
the slightest idea

27:01.576 --> 27:02.446
of what you're doing.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.275
And in the end,

27:05.319 --> 27:08.191
you just turn on each other
like rats and kill each other.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.758
-Wait, who hired you?
-[gun cocks]

27:09.802 --> 27:10.890
-Was it--
-[glass shattering]

27:12.239 --> 27:13.109
[thuds]

27:25.905 --> 27:28.995
I'll clean up the body at night
and dispose of it tomorrow.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.300
Who sent the Russian,
you think?

27:30.344 --> 27:31.824
If I had to guess...

27:33.826 --> 27:35.349
my sister Hermosa.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.221
She's pretty pissed at me,
I think.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.745
For ordering
the hit on your father?

27:42.225 --> 27:44.010
Wait, you know about that?

27:44.053 --> 27:45.402
Oh, my God, does Abuelitaknow?

27:45.446 --> 27:46.926
No, she doesn't.

27:46.969 --> 27:47.970
[sighs]

27:48.014 --> 27:49.624
Look, I make it my business

27:49.668 --> 27:52.540
to know about everything
that happens in this family.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.238
And I make sure none of it
touches your abuelita.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.459
How do you do what you do
and then...

28:00.853 --> 28:04.204
sit down to dinner with
Abuelitalike nothing happened?

28:04.247 --> 28:05.945
Are you just
a really good actor?

28:06.902 --> 28:09.165
Yes, but...

28:09.209 --> 28:11.080
it also helps that I don't see
the world in black and white.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.344
It's all just shades of gray.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.740
No person is just one thing.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.792
[Jughead] When Tabitha
came home from Pop's,

29:10.836 --> 29:14.013
I surprised her by showing her
the pages I'd written that day.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.537
I explained that Daniel's
graphic novel had been the key.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.018
I used to write
by hearing words, auditory.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.281
But Daniel's graphic novel
showed me a workaround.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.109
I could write
from a visual space,

29:23.152 --> 29:25.938
seeing words and actions,
then describing them.

29:34.555 --> 29:37.601
And then I kissed her
for not giving up on me.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.518
For never giving up on me.

29:41.562 --> 29:42.911
[Archie] Dennis,
what's going on?

29:42.955 --> 29:45.087
Hey, guess what I found.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.004
Holy crap.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.136
You must have
done some digging.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.180
Where do you find this?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.675
[cell phone ringing]

30:07.718 --> 30:09.416
-Hello.
-[man on phone] Agent Cooper.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.244
I'm calling the number
you listed on those flyers.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.594
I think the Trash Bag Killer
is at the end of Sketch Alley.

30:13.637 --> 30:14.769
I'm on my way.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.257
He's down there,
at the end of the alley.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.475
Keep everyone back.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.004
Hey! Put your hands up!

30:33.701 --> 30:34.528
On your knees.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.097
Don't move.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.968
Please don't shoot me.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.274
Take off your mask.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.105
I'm not TBK, I'm just a guy.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.454
Who gave you that mask?

30:47.497 --> 30:49.064
Some man who came by earlier.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.761
He gave me 50 bucks
and told me to wear the mask

30:50.805 --> 30:51.893
and to deliver a message
to a blonde woman

30:51.937 --> 30:52.894
when she showed up.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.202
What's the message?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.858
"Check the trash cans,"
he said.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.093
Glen.

31:24.970 --> 31:28.103
[reciting prayer in Spanish]

31:32.542 --> 31:35.023
[Veronica] Thank you all
for being here.

31:35.067 --> 31:40.986
I won't stand here and wax
sentimental about my father.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.466
He did horrible,
unspeakable things

31:43.510 --> 31:45.425
to my mother, to my sister,

31:45.468 --> 31:48.123
to my lover at the time,
Archie Andrews,

31:48.167 --> 31:51.126
to my friends, to this town.

31:53.041 --> 31:53.999
And to me.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.871
[guests murmuring]

31:56.915 --> 32:02.224
But I'm also making room for
the fact that, on occasion...

32:02.268 --> 32:07.186
He did a few
not-so-horrible things, too

32:07.229 --> 32:11.538
He was a proud state champion
wrestler for Riverdale High.

32:11.581 --> 32:14.497
He donated money to
the research of rare diseases.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.109
He covered the funeral expense
of Fred Andrews,

32:17.152 --> 32:19.459
with whom he did not see
eye to eye,

32:19.502 --> 32:21.287
without hesitation.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.854
And he was a dutiful son
to my abuelita.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.335
The truth is...

32:29.208 --> 32:30.774
I loved him till the end.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.214
Make no mistake,

32:35.257 --> 32:37.520
I wish my father hadn't done
those awful things,

32:37.564 --> 32:42.221
and I wish I could
sort my feelings more cleanly.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.223
But I can't.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.011
And maybe
there's something to be said

32:50.055 --> 32:52.709
about a child's willingness
to forgive their fathers

32:52.753 --> 32:54.581
for the terrible things
they might have done.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.933
But for what Hiram Lodge
did to all of you...

33:00.239 --> 33:01.631
I apologize.

33:04.199 --> 33:07.420
And I also apologize
for the fact that...

33:09.074 --> 33:10.597
that I will always...

33:12.120 --> 33:17.169
always love... my Daddykins.

33:20.259 --> 33:21.782
I wish I didn't,

33:22.696 --> 33:25.307
but... I do.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.010
Thank you.

33:35.448 --> 33:36.449
[eerie music]

33:46.633 --> 33:49.549
[TBK] Good. You're awake.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.303
Hey. Hey, who are you?

34:04.346 --> 34:06.653
[shushing]

34:06.696 --> 34:08.437
I'm the bogeyman.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.483
I'm Betty's blind spot.

34:10.526 --> 34:14.878
I've heard every one of your
secret whispered conversations,

34:14.922 --> 34:16.489
and I'm not sure why,

34:16.532 --> 34:19.274
but I know
that piece of rock there

34:19.318 --> 34:23.017
makes your flesh
weak and vulnerable.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.323
So I'm going to get ready,

34:24.366 --> 34:28.022
and then we're gonna have
a grand old time

34:28.066 --> 34:30.938
chopping you up
into little chunks.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.419
[shudders]

34:34.507 --> 34:36.683
[grunts, straining]

34:36.726 --> 34:37.988
[knocking on door]

34:38.032 --> 34:38.946
Archie?

34:40.948 --> 34:42.384
Archie, where are you?

34:42.428 --> 34:45.866
Get rid of her,
or I'll hack her up too.

34:46.519 --> 34:47.868
Do it now.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.130
Alice.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.653
I'm just cleaning.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.481
I'll come by later.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.962
Well, you can,
but your dog can't.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.398
He got into my closet again

34:56.442 --> 34:58.705
and ruined
my favorite kitten heels.

34:58.748 --> 35:01.186
It's fine. Just go, please.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.013
[whimpers, whines]

35:03.057 --> 35:04.319
I'm leaving him here.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.366
We'll talk
about compensation later.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.370
Well done.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.373
But don't worry.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.767
We'll be visiting Alice later.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.465

[Bingo barking]

35:23.643 --> 35:25.123

35:25.166 --> 35:26.602
Bingo, kill!

35:26.646 --> 35:27.821
[Bingo growls, barks]

35:31.390 --> 35:32.869
[Bingo continues barking]

35:34.044 --> 35:35.916
Good boy.

35:35.959 --> 35:39.267
Bingo. Bingo. Come here, boy.
Hey, come here.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.747
Come here. Yes.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.488
Good boy. Good boy.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.838
Good boy. Yes, good boy.

35:48.755 --> 35:51.366
-[Hermione sighs]
-It was great seeing you, Mom.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.107
Circumstances notwithstanding.

35:53.151 --> 35:57.372
I love you, honey.
I'm so, so proud of you.

35:57.416 --> 36:00.549
Okay. Thanksgiving at
the Barefoot Contessa's, huh?

36:00.593 --> 36:01.637
Anderson and Andy
will be there.

36:02.899 --> 36:03.987
That sounds nice, Mom.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.689
I can take your abuelita
to the airport if you want.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.040
Thanks, Reggie.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.697
Thanks for coming
to the funeral.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.483
You were the only one
from the gang who did.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.660
I'm sure everyone else
was busy.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.316
I really enjoyed your eulogy.

36:29.361 --> 36:30.710
It resonated with me.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.496
And I don't think
I really ever understood

36:34.540 --> 36:36.281
what you had with your dad.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.108
If I didn't understand it,

36:38.152 --> 36:40.110
what gives me the right
to judge it in the first place?

36:40.154 --> 36:41.808
What you did doesn't matter,

36:41.851 --> 36:42.722
because I love you.

36:43.723 --> 36:44.898
Thank you, Reggie.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.513
Sorry to ruin the moment.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.951
Damn, dude's super quiet.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.389
I have something for you,
Miss Lodge.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.652
Found it among
the Russian's personal effects.

36:59.695 --> 37:00.609
What is it?

37:00.653 --> 37:02.132
It's a recording...

37:02.176 --> 37:03.960
that Hiram made
during his final moments.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.226
Give it a listen.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.364
I still can't wrap my brain
around the fact

37:16.408 --> 37:18.584
that TBK was here

37:18.627 --> 37:20.847
the whole time
right under our noses.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.762
I mean, where did you even
hire Dennis,

37:22.805 --> 37:24.372
if that's his name?

37:24.416 --> 37:27.897
He saw my ad for crew
in Jug's newspaper.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.725
He must have been trying
to keep tabs on you through me.

37:29.769 --> 37:34.077
God knows how long
he's been spying on me for.

37:34.121 --> 37:37.255
Long enough to know
that Glen was being a dick.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.562
And to know that we were
manifesting our powers.

37:40.606 --> 37:41.868
And weaknesses.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.696
And side effects,
like my headaches.

37:43.739 --> 37:44.827
[Bingo panting]

37:46.481 --> 37:47.830
Well, at least now we know

37:47.874 --> 37:48.918
what he looks like
without a mask on.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.790
Yeah.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.095
Though, he could have
really hurt you.

37:52.139 --> 37:54.359
Luckily, Bingo remembers
his commands

37:54.402 --> 37:55.708
from his old dog-fighting days.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.319
He saved my life.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.668
Pushed TBK
right out that window,

37:59.712 --> 38:01.017
and then TBK ran off.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.280
Yeah, he does that.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.283
What about Glen, Betty?

38:07.807 --> 38:09.417
I found most of him.

38:11.245 --> 38:12.246
Including his head.

38:14.509 --> 38:15.989
So now I need to leave.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.384
I need to get out of Riverdale.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.994
I don't understand. Why?

38:21.037 --> 38:23.344
Because I brought TBK here.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.433
He went after Glen,
he went after you.

38:25.477 --> 38:28.349
If I leave, he will follow me.
I know he will.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.655
Betty, if you're a target--

38:29.698 --> 38:30.830
Well, better to be
a moving target

38:30.873 --> 38:32.745
than one standing still.

38:32.788 --> 38:35.617
I'll lead TBK out of Riverdale,
and then I'll circle back.

38:35.661 --> 38:38.881
Something will distract him.
Something always distracts him.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.363
Are you...
Are you gonna be okay?

38:43.495 --> 38:44.713
Yeah, I'll be fine.

38:46.062 --> 38:48.369
Just keep that palladium
away from me.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.284
Hmm.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.459
And come back in one piece.

38:52.982 --> 38:53.940
Deal.

39:10.609 --> 39:12.437
[Hiram on tape] Mija,

39:12.480 --> 39:15.265
I don't have much time left.

39:15.309 --> 39:17.746
But I need you to know
one thing

39:17.790 --> 39:20.227
Whatever I may have said
about wishing I had a son,

39:20.270 --> 39:23.709
all of that changed the moment
I first held you in my arms.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.322
You became
my treasure instantly.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.500
And I want you to know that,
despite our troubles,

39:32.544 --> 39:35.634
you have always been
the apple of my eye.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.679
Everything I did,
no matter how heartless

39:37.723 --> 39:39.942
or inexplicable
or unjustifiable was...

39:40.856 --> 39:41.683
for you.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.686
I think perhaps I was testing

39:44.730 --> 39:47.733
the limits of love a daughter
can have for her father,

39:47.776 --> 39:51.389
and you,mija amada,
never faltered, never failed.

39:51.432 --> 39:55.567
I never felt anything less than
love for you or from you.

39:55.610 --> 39:56.698
I hope you believe that.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.352
[crying]

39:58.396 --> 40:00.441
One last thing.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.965
I'm leaving you
my rum business,

40:03.009 --> 40:04.924
the crown jewel of my empire.

40:07.187 --> 40:08.928
I don't think I was
ever happier

40:08.971 --> 40:10.451
than when we were
in the middle of our rum war.

40:10.495 --> 40:13.323
-[chuckles]
-Do you remember?

40:13.367 --> 40:15.456
Those were good times,
weren't they?

40:15.500 --> 40:17.197
[sniffles]

40:17.240 --> 40:19.634
I always wanted to be
a good father to you, Veronica.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.161
I love you so much.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.861
[Hiram speaking Spanish
on tape]

40:29.905 --> 40:31.124
[tape ends]

40:42.135 --> 40:45.094
[loud banging]

40:45.138 --> 40:46.792
[inaudible shouts]

40:52.841 --> 40:54.930
We'll have no more of that,
I think.

41:04.897 --> 41:05.985
[Jughead] So the story
hasn't been about

41:06.028 --> 41:07.943
things I can't do anymore.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.293
It's about the things
I've learned to do differently.

41:10.337 --> 41:13.819
And what new possibilities
lie before me.

41:13.862 --> 41:15.473
[Tabitha] Did I leave
the oven on at Pop's?

41:18.040 --> 41:18.954
Tabitha.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.217
Did you just say something?

41:26.396 --> 41:28.703
[Tabitha] I'm sure
I turned the oven off.

41:28.747 --> 41:30.531
But did I lock the door
behind me?

41:33.403 --> 41:34.535
Tabby.

41:36.276 --> 41:37.973
Are you wondering
if you left the door unlocked?
