WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.280
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.418 --> 00:07.283
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.421 --> 00:11.804
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.942 --> 00:14.738
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.876 --> 00:17.672
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.810 --> 00:21.987
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.471 --> 00:25.887
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.026 --> 00:28.580
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.718 --> 00:31.238
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.376 --> 00:33.895
Just to get up that hill

00:34.034 --> 00:36.484
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.622 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.593
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.731 --> 00:43.319
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.457 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.749
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.887 --> 01:06.066
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:11.657 --> 01:12.865
Right this way.

01:13.003 --> 01:14.350
This is
the Jeffersons' apartment,

01:14.488 --> 01:15.868
the one I was telling
you about.

01:16.006 --> 01:17.387
They're not at home now.

01:17.525 --> 01:20.977
Not home? Estelle, you mean,
you dragged me down here...

01:21.115 --> 01:23.497
Martin, you're a drag
wherever you are.

01:25.223 --> 01:27.328
Careful, Estelle.

01:27.466 --> 01:29.606
No problem at all.
I have a pass key.

01:29.744 --> 01:33.403
As long as Mr. Whittendale
sent you, I'm sure it'll be
perfectly all right.

01:33.541 --> 01:38.098
Ah, here we are.
This is the living room,
the dining area.

01:38.236 --> 01:40.928
And here is a very large
terrace with a lovely view.

01:41.066 --> 01:42.757
Oh, really?
What can you see?

01:42.895 --> 01:43.965
The outside.

01:45.829 --> 01:48.418
It's a little joke
I use sometimes.

01:48.556 --> 01:49.557
Very little.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.666
Would you like to see
the bedrooms now?

01:54.804 --> 01:56.771
Are you sure
the Jeffersons won't mind?

01:56.909 --> 02:00.637
Not at all. The doorman
told me they were away
at a wedding.

02:00.775 --> 02:02.329
Now the bedrooms
are right this way.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.468
Come, come, come.

02:06.712 --> 02:09.336
Here comes the bride

02:09.474 --> 02:11.959
Running for all
she's worth

02:12.097 --> 02:14.686
Let's get her married

02:18.897 --> 02:20.070
That's a good one, pal.

02:20.209 --> 02:22.003
Yeah, I'm full of them.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.765
He's full of champagne
from the wedding.

02:27.699 --> 02:30.598
He's acting a little silly
because he drank too much.

02:30.736 --> 02:32.566
He'd be acting sillier
if he didn't drink enough.

02:34.499 --> 02:35.741
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:35.879 --> 02:36.846
Why? I thought
it was funny.

02:36.984 --> 02:38.192
No, I mean the cigar.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.987
You're not supposed
to smoke in here.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.747
Don't worry about it.
I won't arrest you.

02:41.885 --> 02:43.370
No, the law's the law.

02:43.508 --> 02:44.647
You know, it's a shame
to waste it.

02:44.785 --> 02:45.924
Why don't you take it?

02:46.062 --> 02:47.097
Okay, thanks.

02:47.822 --> 02:48.789
See you later.
Come on, Weez.

02:48.927 --> 02:50.342
I hope the smoke
didn't bother you.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.723
Oh, no, not at all.

02:51.861 --> 02:53.794
I wasn't even thinking
when I lit it.

02:53.932 --> 02:55.485
It's okay. Forget it.

02:55.623 --> 02:56.900
MAN: All right, just as long
as you're sure
you're not mad.

02:58.626 --> 02:59.903
You!

03:02.734 --> 03:03.735
That...

03:07.601 --> 03:11.191
Oh, calm down, George.
It was just a practical joke.

03:11.329 --> 03:13.848
Yeah, but it scared
the hell out of me.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.127
Well, why?
You're always shooting
your mouth off anyway.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.095
That ain't funny, Weezy.

03:19.233 --> 03:23.410
Oh, come on, George,
Florence has the day off and
it'll just be the two of us.

03:23.548 --> 03:24.549
So?

03:24.687 --> 03:27.862
So, you know what
weddings do to me.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.624
That's right. What are
we waiting for?

03:32.004 --> 03:34.593
Oh, I'll never forget
our wedding night.

03:34.731 --> 03:37.251
Yeah, we couldn't afford
a motel, so we had to
stay at my house.

03:38.977 --> 03:43.084
Remember the hard time
you had carrying me
across the threshold?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.363
Well, it wasn't my fault.
Mama wouldn't unlock
the door.

03:47.779 --> 03:50.160
Well, at least after
we were married a month,

03:50.299 --> 03:52.818
we finally
had enough money to go
away for the weekend.

03:52.956 --> 03:55.925
Yeah. Then we had
to stay at that motel
by the railroad tracks.

03:56.063 --> 03:58.410
And every hour
the bed would shake.

03:58.548 --> 04:01.896
Well, just think how bad
it would have been
if the trains were running.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.002
Oh!

04:10.250 --> 04:12.873
CURTIS:
The master bedroom
has lots to offer.

04:13.011 --> 04:15.393
MARTIN: Yeah. The bathroom
has possibilities, too.

04:15.531 --> 04:17.912
ESTELLE: Oh, I think so, too.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.535
George, somebody broke
into our apartment!

04:19.673 --> 04:21.295
Shh. Stand back, Weezy,
I'll get this.

04:26.162 --> 04:27.991
Mr. Jefferson,
what are you doing?

04:28.129 --> 04:29.579
I'm gonna
bust your brains in,
that's what I'm gonna do.

04:29.717 --> 04:32.168
Oh, hold it.
Just hold it!

04:32.306 --> 04:34.619
I'm Mr. Curtis.
What?

04:34.757 --> 04:36.724
I work for Mr. Whittendale.
Remember?

04:37.380 --> 04:39.624
Oh, yeah, Whittendale.

04:41.453 --> 04:44.594
Oh, you're the man who
rented us our apartment.

04:44.732 --> 04:45.940
Right.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.080
What are you
doing here now?
Well, you see, I...

04:48.218 --> 04:50.186
Get a load
of these monstrosities.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.568
Oh, hello.

04:52.706 --> 04:54.708
Hi. Who the hell
are they?

04:55.812 --> 04:57.020
The Foxes.

04:59.368 --> 05:01.784
Well, she ain't too bad,
but he's a real stiff.

05:02.854 --> 05:04.683
Here, Estelle,
you hold this end.

05:04.821 --> 05:06.478
All right.

05:06.616 --> 05:09.723
Five foot ten inches,
just right.

05:09.861 --> 05:11.241
Say, would you mind
explaining to me
what the hell you're...

05:11.380 --> 05:13.347
We're just checking
on where to put my piano.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.142
I know exactly
where you can put it!

05:16.212 --> 05:17.420
Really?

05:17.558 --> 05:19.802
Would you hold this
for a second?
What?

05:19.940 --> 05:21.769
What's the reading?
What?

05:21.907 --> 05:23.530
What does it say
on the tape measure?

05:24.393 --> 05:25.773
About eight feet.
Perfect.

05:25.911 --> 05:27.430
Ow! Damn it!

05:28.811 --> 05:31.710
Mr. Curtis,
would you please tell us
what's going on?

05:31.848 --> 05:34.541
Well, I tried
calling earlier,
but you weren't home.

05:34.679 --> 05:36.301
How did you get in?

05:36.439 --> 05:40.305
Well, I used my pass key.
Ralph said you were
at a wedding.

05:40.443 --> 05:42.756
What gives you the right to
come busting in here when
there ain't nobody home?

05:42.894 --> 05:44.378
Well, this is
Mr. Whittendale's building.

05:44.516 --> 05:47.519
And the Foxes are friends
of Mr. Whittendale's.

05:47.657 --> 05:49.383
They've just
moved here from upstate,

05:49.521 --> 05:51.765
and they're looking
for an apartment.

05:51.903 --> 05:54.802
But why are they looking
in our apartment?

05:54.940 --> 05:56.528
They want to see
if they'd like living here.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.806
In this building?
In this apartment.

05:58.944 --> 06:00.429
We live here!

06:00.567 --> 06:02.672
Yes, but your lease
expires next month.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.398
So what? We'll renew it.

06:04.536 --> 06:07.953
Oh, well, I'm afraid
it's not really up to you.

06:08.091 --> 06:11.750
You can only renew your
lease if Mr. Whittendale
wants you to stay.

06:11.888 --> 06:13.649
That's illegal!

06:14.166 --> 06:15.375
Ain't it?

06:15.513 --> 06:18.205
Not at all. It's on
the lease that you signed.

06:18.343 --> 06:20.172
Oh, yeah?
Well, we'll see about that.

06:22.554 --> 06:24.245
It does not need
painting, Martin.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.040
Whoever heard of
a brown kitchen?

06:26.178 --> 06:28.457
My mother's kitchen
was brown!

06:28.595 --> 06:31.252
That's because she
never washed the walls.

06:32.564 --> 06:34.048
Careful, Estelle.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.671
Well, what about
the dining room?

06:35.809 --> 06:38.432
You wanna paint this, too?
No, it looks fine.

06:38.570 --> 06:41.331
Fine? Oh, it should be
a warm pink.

06:41.470 --> 06:43.264
What's wrong
with the blue?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.922
Oh, it's hideous.
That's what's wrong
with it.

06:46.060 --> 06:48.994
Oh, hello, Mrs...
Jefferson.

06:49.132 --> 06:54.517
Yes. Um, we were just
admiring the dining room.

06:54.655 --> 06:55.829
It's such a lovely...

06:56.277 --> 06:57.451
Color?

06:59.004 --> 07:00.178
I found our lease!

07:00.972 --> 07:02.939
Oh, good, George.

07:03.077 --> 07:04.769
No, bad, Weezy.

07:04.907 --> 07:06.426
Whittendale doesn't
have to renew our lease
if he doesn't want to.

07:06.564 --> 07:08.358
Just as I said.

07:08.497 --> 07:11.431
You mean, Mr. Whittendale
would throw us out,
just like that?

07:11.569 --> 07:14.537
Oh, no,
he wouldn't do that.

07:14.675 --> 07:15.952
Thank goodness!

07:16.090 --> 07:19.162
He'll give you
at least a week to find
another apartment.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.785
Well, have you folks
seen enough, huh?

07:20.923 --> 07:22.649
Mmm-hmm.
Yes. And we love it.

07:22.787 --> 07:24.789
Oh, now, you wouldn't wanna
move into this apartment.

07:24.927 --> 07:26.273
Why not?

07:26.411 --> 07:28.793
Well, uh, there are
a lot of reasons.
Like what?

07:28.931 --> 07:30.588
Like, uh...

07:30.726 --> 07:34.212
See that? There's so
many reasons, I can't
even think of them all.

07:34.350 --> 07:36.870
Well, then, they can't be
very important.

07:37.008 --> 07:38.699
It's a very noisy apartment.

07:38.837 --> 07:39.942
Noisy?

07:40.080 --> 07:43.877
Uh, yes. From all
the traffic on the street.

07:44.015 --> 07:48.088
Jefferson, you're 12
stories up. You can't
hear any street noise.

07:48.226 --> 07:49.538
That's 'cause
we're up so high,

07:49.676 --> 07:51.712
all the noise from the
airplanes drowns it out.

07:52.886 --> 07:55.302
And don't forget about
the neighbors. Awful.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.373
Always knocking
on your door,
pestering you.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.824
Oh, that's wonderful.

07:59.962 --> 08:01.135
Wonderful?

08:01.273 --> 08:03.172
Well, we'll be happy
just to have neighbors.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.691
We just moved
from the country,

08:04.829 --> 08:07.210
and our nearest neighbor
was miles away.

08:07.348 --> 08:09.937
I never had anyone
to talk to.

08:10.593 --> 08:11.801
What about me?

08:13.458 --> 08:15.909
Thank you for showing us
the apartment.

08:16.668 --> 08:17.945
Oh, but you can't...

08:18.083 --> 08:20.085
Hey, Curtis, wait.
Yes?

08:20.223 --> 08:22.087
You can always use some
extra money, can't you?

08:22.225 --> 08:23.261
Well, can't we all?

08:23.399 --> 08:24.814
How does $500 sound?

08:24.952 --> 08:26.540
Oh, like a symphony.

08:26.678 --> 08:29.509
Well, just
call me Beethoven.

08:29.647 --> 08:32.028
Well, well,
well, well, well.
What's this for?

08:32.166 --> 08:35.825
For you. All you got to do
is tell Whittendale to let
us stay in this apartment.

08:35.963 --> 08:38.207
I'm afraid that's out
of the question.

08:38.345 --> 08:41.624
You see,
the Foxes are friends
of Mr. Whittendale's.

08:42.383 --> 08:45.007
However,
if you're interested,

08:45.145 --> 08:48.562
there is a small
one bedroom apartment
vacant on the third.

08:49.356 --> 08:50.633
Get out of here.

08:50.771 --> 08:53.394
Well, it's as good
as my apartment.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.329
Oh, George, this is terrible.
We're losing our apartment!

08:57.467 --> 09:00.056
Yeah, I don't wanna
move out of here.
I like this place.

09:00.194 --> 09:02.265
I got my main
store downstairs.

09:02.403 --> 09:04.164
Oh, this is awful.

09:04.302 --> 09:05.717
Yeah. And it's all
your fault.

09:07.616 --> 09:09.479
My fault?
Yeah, that's right.

09:09.618 --> 09:11.758
If you'd let me make
friends with Whittendale,
like the Foxes did,

09:11.896 --> 09:13.345
he'd be giving us
our apartment.

09:14.036 --> 09:15.382
I never stopped you!

09:15.520 --> 09:17.177
Yes, you did.
Every time I try to find

09:17.315 --> 09:18.350
a new way to make
friends with Whittendale,

09:18.488 --> 09:19.559
you said it was dumb.

09:20.318 --> 09:22.251
It was dumb.

09:22.389 --> 09:24.184
Especially when you
bought those bicycles,

09:24.322 --> 09:26.151
because you heard
Mr. Whittendale rode

09:26.289 --> 09:28.084
his bike in the park
every Sunday.

09:28.222 --> 09:30.811
Well, I thought it was
a good way for me to
casually bump into him.

09:30.949 --> 09:36.334
But instead, you casually
bumped into a rose bush,
a fence, and a policeman.

09:36.472 --> 09:38.025
Well, it would have worked
if you'd have helped me.

09:38.163 --> 09:39.717
I did help you.

09:39.855 --> 09:42.374
I plucked the rose thorns
out of your behind.

09:44.135 --> 09:45.930
Yeah, well, you better really
help me think of a good way

09:46.068 --> 09:47.379
to make friends
with Whittendale now,

09:47.517 --> 09:49.450
or else we could just
kiss this apartment goodbye.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.073
Well, why don't you
just call him?

09:51.211 --> 09:52.143
Call him, Weezy,
on the phone?

09:52.281 --> 09:53.558
Are you kidding?
I can't do that.

09:53.696 --> 09:55.491
Okay. Then I'll do it.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.874
Weezy, look, you don't just
be calling Whittendale on
the phone just like that.

09:59.012 --> 10:00.427
It's worth a try.

10:00.565 --> 10:02.843
I'll just speak to him
as one human being
to another,

10:02.981 --> 10:04.569
and invite him down
for a drink.

10:04.707 --> 10:07.883
As one human
being to another,
are you crazy, Weezy?

10:08.021 --> 10:11.196
Whittendale
ain't no human being!
He's a millionaire banker.

10:12.163 --> 10:15.200
Hello. Who am
I talking to?

10:15.338 --> 10:19.066
Oh, good. This is
Louise Jefferson,
Apartment 12-D.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.344
I just wondered if...

10:21.482 --> 10:23.761
You're just making a fool
of yourself, Weezy, trying
to talk to that man.

10:23.899 --> 10:26.384
Oh, you do? How nice.

10:26.522 --> 10:28.697
I was just saying
to my husband,

10:28.835 --> 10:31.872
"Why don't we invite
Mr. Whittendale
down for a drink?"

10:33.667 --> 10:34.841
Oh...

10:34.979 --> 10:36.221
Okay.

10:36.359 --> 10:37.947
Goodbye.

10:38.085 --> 10:39.949
You see that? I told you
you was wasting your time.

10:40.087 --> 10:41.606
Weezy, when are you
gonna listen to me?

10:41.744 --> 10:43.677
He'll be down
in 20 minutes.

10:44.851 --> 10:45.852
Say what?

10:45.990 --> 10:47.888
He said he'd love
to meet us.

10:48.026 --> 10:49.752
Weezy, I knew you
could do it!

10:51.236 --> 10:52.928
Whittendale's coming
down here?

10:53.066 --> 10:54.895
You know what this means?
Sure.

10:55.033 --> 10:58.209
The big cheese
meets Mighty Mouse.

11:09.220 --> 11:11.532
Hey, hey, Weezy,
the place looks great.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.604
Oh, thanks, George. I just
hope Mr. Whittendale likes
the way we're keeping it.

11:14.743 --> 11:16.606
Look, Weezy, don't worry
about Whittendale.

11:16.745 --> 11:18.332
I'll use my
personality on him.

11:21.922 --> 11:25.443
Don't you think we're in
enough trouble already?

11:25.581 --> 11:29.412
Now, look, we'll tell him
how much we love
the apartment, and...

11:29.550 --> 11:32.484
Weezy, we don't
mention the apartment
until the time is right.

11:32.622 --> 11:34.383
First we gotta get
to be friends with him.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.903
Oh, that must
be him now.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.180
Let me handle this.

11:42.149 --> 11:43.530
Oh, Bentley,
what do you want?

11:43.668 --> 11:44.945
Hello, Mr. J.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.223
I've got something I think
you'd really like to see.

11:47.361 --> 11:50.502
You know what I'd really
like to see? You walking
back to your apartment.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.263
Oh, you've seen
that before.

11:53.574 --> 11:55.162
What is it, Mr. Bentley?

11:55.300 --> 11:59.373
What I have,
Mrs. J, is a colony
of hymenoptera.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.237
Oh, how nice.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.999
Commonly called
an ant farm.

12:04.137 --> 12:06.864
Oh, you mean you've got
bugs in that case?

12:07.002 --> 12:10.281
Why not? He's got
bats in his belfry.

12:10.419 --> 12:13.594
These little creatures
have a lifestyle very
similar to our own.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.011
Oh, you mean, they got
nosey neighbors, too?

12:16.149 --> 12:18.910
And ants are so efficient.
Each one has a definite job.

12:19.048 --> 12:22.017
These are the workers here,
and these here
are the soldiers.

12:22.155 --> 12:23.294
How can you tell?

12:23.432 --> 12:25.572
By their large mandibles.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.056
Mr. Bentley!

12:28.955 --> 12:32.682
That's their jaws.
And this one here
is the queen.

12:32.821 --> 12:35.202
How can you tell,
by the way he walks?

12:38.896 --> 12:42.658
Uh, I don't mean to
be rude, Mr. Bentley,
but I hate ants.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.280
They give me
the willies.

12:44.418 --> 12:46.800
Would you mind taking them
back to your apartment?

12:46.938 --> 12:49.423
Oh, dear, I was hoping
you could take them off
my hands.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.012
You see, they were a gift
and I haven't the time
to care for pets.

12:52.150 --> 12:54.912
Look, Bentley, if you plan
on leaving those ants here,
you can forget that.

12:55.050 --> 12:59.123
I agree with George,
Mr. Bentley. Who would wanna
live with a bunch of ants?

12:59.261 --> 13:01.366
A bunch of uncles?
Bentley, you get the...

13:01.504 --> 13:02.920
Oh, dear!

13:03.058 --> 13:05.336
GEORGE: Hey!
Oh, Your Majesty!

13:05.474 --> 13:06.889
Oh, the ants are loose!

13:07.027 --> 13:08.339
Get the vacuum cleaner!

13:08.477 --> 13:10.513
Oh, no, no. Please don't
hurt the poor things.

13:12.343 --> 13:15.104
After all, they've just
come from a broken home.

13:16.692 --> 13:19.902
Perhaps if I get some honey,
we could trap them.
LOUISE: Ow!

13:20.040 --> 13:21.352
Get out!

13:21.490 --> 13:24.527
Oh, the apartment is
crawling with ants.

13:24.665 --> 13:27.496
If Mr. Whittendale sees this,
he'll throw us out before
our lease is up.

13:27.634 --> 13:30.085
Well, he ain't gonna see
them, if you hurry up
and start the vacuum cleaner.

13:30.223 --> 13:33.985
Are you sure it's okay
to suck up a bunch of live
ants in a vacuum?

13:34.123 --> 13:35.538
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe we should
kill them first.

13:35.676 --> 13:36.677
Yeah.

13:39.025 --> 13:40.681
Come on, Weezy,
give me a hand
with these things.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.235
Oh, George,
I don't wanna...

13:42.373 --> 13:44.099
Oh, Weezy, look!
These little things
can't hurt you.

13:44.237 --> 13:45.272
Ow!

13:45.410 --> 13:47.309
We can't even see them all.

13:47.447 --> 13:49.138
They blend
right into the rug.

13:49.276 --> 13:50.450
Start the vacuum!

13:52.452 --> 13:53.971
That's Whittendale.
Turn off the vacuum.

13:54.109 --> 13:55.558
I haven't even
started it yet.

13:55.696 --> 13:56.801
Good. Put it away.

13:56.939 --> 13:58.320
But what about the ants?

13:58.458 --> 13:59.631
Look, Weezy,
it'll be all right.

13:59.769 --> 14:01.047
Just don't let Whittendale
go behind the sofa.

14:01.185 --> 14:02.220
Oh...

14:03.877 --> 14:05.775
Mr. Jefferson?
What do you want?

14:05.914 --> 14:07.777
Your wife invited me
down for a drink.

14:09.158 --> 14:10.366
You're Mr. Whittendale?

14:10.504 --> 14:11.920
Have been all my life.

14:12.058 --> 14:13.853
Oh, pleased to meet you.

14:13.991 --> 14:15.440
I got you again!

14:15.578 --> 14:18.305
Boy, that was a good one.
Ha! Come on in.

14:22.171 --> 14:24.311
Louise, this is
Mr. Whittendale.

14:25.140 --> 14:26.210
You're...

14:26.348 --> 14:28.384
Yeah, the funny guy
from the elevator.

14:28.522 --> 14:31.629
Hey, that cigar joke was
pretty funny. Right, Weez?

14:31.767 --> 14:33.320
Uh, yeah, yeah, right.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.943
Well, what about
that drink?

14:35.081 --> 14:36.841
You want one?
That's why
I'm here, isn't it?

14:36.979 --> 14:39.430
Oh...
Oh, oh, Louise will get
it for you. Right, Weezy?

14:39.568 --> 14:41.673
Uh, uh... Oh, sure.

14:41.811 --> 14:42.951
What do you drink,
Mr. Whittendale?

14:43.089 --> 14:44.055
What do you have?

14:44.193 --> 14:45.401
Uh, everything.

14:45.539 --> 14:46.644
That's what I drink.

14:47.610 --> 14:49.992
But I'll start with
Scotch straight up.

14:50.130 --> 14:51.407
Make that two, Weezy.

14:51.545 --> 14:53.823
Uh, two. Right...

15:06.698 --> 15:07.734
What's wrong?

15:07.872 --> 15:09.115
Oh, tight socks.

15:12.532 --> 15:14.672
How'd you do in
the market today?

15:14.810 --> 15:16.225
Well, I didn't go shopping.

15:16.363 --> 15:19.746
Didn't go shopping?
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
that's funny.

15:19.884 --> 15:20.816
Did you hear
that one, Weez?

15:20.954 --> 15:23.612
Oh, uh, yeah.
Here you go.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.096
Oh, thanks, Mrs. Jefferson.

15:26.477 --> 15:27.685
Well, here's how.

15:29.135 --> 15:30.895
I'd like
to make a toast...

15:31.033 --> 15:33.173
Oh, let me get another
drink, George, and I will
join you in that toast.

15:33.311 --> 15:35.693
Oh, uh, you don't
have to do that,
Mr. Whittendale.

15:36.797 --> 15:38.972
Uh, here. Why don't
you just take my drink?

15:39.110 --> 15:40.318
Oh, but I don't wanna...

15:40.456 --> 15:42.286
Oh, go right ahead.
I wasn't really
thirsty anyway.

15:42.424 --> 15:46.290
Well, if you insist.
But let me make the toast.

15:46.428 --> 15:49.810
Here's to two of the nicest,
friendliest people
in the building.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.951
Oh, I'll drink to that.

16:03.997 --> 16:08.070
Uh, Mr. Whittendale,
about our apartment...

16:08.208 --> 16:10.176
Not yet, Weez...

16:15.526 --> 16:16.906
Something the matter?

16:17.045 --> 16:19.081
Oh, no, I was wondering
if this was real wool.

16:19.219 --> 16:20.462
Camel hair.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.222
Oh, yeah? Oh...

16:23.844 --> 16:25.605
Oh, I'll get it.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.575
Here it is. Honey.

16:30.713 --> 16:32.992
Oh, how dare
you call me "honey".

16:39.999 --> 16:42.794
It was awfully nice of
you to invite me down
to your apartment.

16:42.932 --> 16:45.797
Well, why not?
You're a hell
of a nice guy.

16:46.350 --> 16:47.385
Gotcha!

16:49.974 --> 16:51.665
What?

16:51.803 --> 16:55.290
Oh, I was just saying
I'm glad we finally got you
to come down here.

16:55.428 --> 16:59.225
Uh, about our apartment,
Mr. Whittendale...

16:59.363 --> 17:03.815
Uh, George and I
can't understand why...

17:03.953 --> 17:05.817
Why we haven't invited
you down before.

17:05.955 --> 17:07.923
Oh, don't let it
worry you, George.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.925
All my friends
are caught up
in the rat race, too.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.721
Oh, yeah?
Oh, sure. You know,

17:12.859 --> 17:15.344
we used to go to the
race track two or three
times a week,

17:15.482 --> 17:17.243
but now they're all
too busy.

17:17.381 --> 17:19.038
Well, I ain't too busy.
I'll go to the racetrack
with you.

17:19.176 --> 17:20.763
You will?
Yeah.

17:20.901 --> 17:22.386
If we hurry up
we can still make
the second double.

17:22.524 --> 17:23.973
Hey, that sounds great.

17:24.112 --> 17:25.182
Mmm...

17:25.941 --> 17:27.529
I don't have any
money on me.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.187
Money? Look, don't worry
about money.
I got plenty of money.

17:30.325 --> 17:31.464
Here.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.467
Three hundred dollars?

17:34.605 --> 17:37.539
Look, don't worry about it.
If anybody's good for it,
you are.

17:37.677 --> 17:39.472
Maybe your wife would like
to go along, too.

17:39.610 --> 17:41.750
Uh, no,
I don't think so.

17:41.888 --> 17:44.304
I figure we'd go and clean
up at the track, and Louise
can clean up here.

17:44.442 --> 17:45.443
Right, Weez?

17:45.581 --> 17:47.342
Uh, right. Yeah.

17:48.550 --> 17:50.621
Are you feeling okay?

17:50.759 --> 17:53.762
You both have been
acting like you've got
ants in your pants.

17:55.936 --> 17:58.111
Ants in your pants!
That's a good one!
Ants in your pants!

17:58.249 --> 17:59.285
LOUISE: Yeah!

17:59.699 --> 18:00.976
Ow!

18:01.804 --> 18:02.874
What's the matter?

18:03.012 --> 18:04.255
It's all right,
don't worry about it.

18:04.393 --> 18:06.050
She just laughed so loud,
she snapped her girdle.

18:06.809 --> 18:08.432
See you later, Weez.
Goodbye!

18:08.570 --> 18:10.330
We're gonna have
a lot of fun at the track.
Oh...

18:34.216 --> 18:35.252
Ow!

18:36.287 --> 18:38.255
They do have
large mandibles.

18:42.328 --> 18:43.639
BOTH:
I got the horse right here

18:43.777 --> 18:45.262
The name is Paul Revere

18:45.400 --> 18:47.919
And here's a guy who says
if the weather's clear

18:48.057 --> 18:50.888
Can do! Can do!

18:51.026 --> 18:52.648
This guy says
the horse can do

18:52.786 --> 18:55.064
Oh, hi, George. Did you
two have a good time?

18:55.203 --> 18:56.687
We had a great time.

18:56.825 --> 18:58.413
Even if we didn't
win no money.

18:58.551 --> 19:01.657
Say, George, you don't
mind if I make myself
a drink, do you?

19:01.795 --> 19:02.865
Uh...

19:03.003 --> 19:05.005
Oh, sure, Mr. Whittendale,
go right ahead.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.560
Why don't you forget
that Mr. Whittendale
stuff, Louise.

19:07.698 --> 19:09.389
Just call me Whitty.

19:12.565 --> 19:14.118
How do you like
that, Weezy? Whitty.

19:14.256 --> 19:15.533
See, ain't no way
in the world

19:15.671 --> 19:17.259
Whittendale is gonna
throw us out of here now.

19:17.397 --> 19:19.123
Did he say that?
Say what?

19:19.261 --> 19:21.712
Say that he's not
gonna throw us
out of our apartment.

19:21.850 --> 19:23.541
I don't know. I didn't get
a chance to ask him yet.

19:23.679 --> 19:25.371
George!
Don't worry about it, Weezy.

19:25.509 --> 19:27.200
I'll ask him as soon as I
take care of these beers.

19:27.338 --> 19:30.065
What beers?
The beers I drank
at the track.

19:37.245 --> 19:38.211
Oh, hi, Ralph.

19:38.349 --> 19:39.316
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson,
ma'am.

19:39.454 --> 19:40.696
Can I help you?

19:40.834 --> 19:42.664
Um, is... Oh, there you
are, Mr. Whittendale, sir.

19:42.802 --> 19:44.666
Oh, hiya, Ralph,
put her there.

19:44.804 --> 19:46.046
Uh, no, thank you, sir.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.117
I've been burned, or should
I say "buzzed" before.

19:49.602 --> 19:51.569
You know, that Ralph,
he's a smart cookie.

19:51.707 --> 19:54.538
Why, thank you, sir.
And I came right up here
to tell you

19:54.676 --> 19:57.023
that your brother
just called
from Switzerland.

19:57.161 --> 19:58.921
He's coming home
tomorrow afternoon,

19:59.059 --> 20:01.855
and he wants you
out of his penthouse by
the time he gets here.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.375
Ralph, why did you tell
H.L. I was here?

20:04.513 --> 20:08.207
Because I'm a smart cookie,
sir, who doesn't
wanna lose his job.

20:08.345 --> 20:12.072
Wait a minute.
You mean, you are not
H.L. Whittendale?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.454
No. I'm R.S. Whittendale.

20:15.352 --> 20:17.043
You don't own
this building?

20:17.181 --> 20:20.322
I don't own anything.
Just the clothes
on my back.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.570
Hey, Ralph, you looking
for me for something?

20:26.708 --> 20:29.228
No, sir. I just came
to bring a message
to Mr...

20:29.366 --> 20:30.746
...Whittendale.

20:30.884 --> 20:32.438
Good afternoon
for now, sir.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.063
You know
something, Weezy?

20:37.201 --> 20:39.962
That is the first time Ralph
ever came to this apartment
and it didn't cost me nothing.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.688
Don't be so sure.

20:43.552 --> 20:45.451
Why don't you both
join me in a drink?

20:45.589 --> 20:48.385
Hey, Weezy,
you should have heard
my man Whitty

20:48.523 --> 20:51.250
at the track, boy.
He had me laughing
so hard.

20:51.388 --> 20:53.838
We were standing in line
at the betting window,
and this guy comes up,

20:53.976 --> 20:56.669
and he says, "What do
you think of Indian Red
in the fifth?"

20:56.807 --> 20:59.292
And my man,
Whitty, here says,
"I don't know about him,

20:59.430 --> 21:01.018
"but I like Johnny Walker
in the quart."

21:04.159 --> 21:06.368
George, we have to talk.

21:06.506 --> 21:09.129
Oh, yeah, Weezy,
now is the time.

21:10.165 --> 21:11.304
Hey, Whitty, old buddy.

21:11.442 --> 21:12.650
Yeah?
You know,

21:12.788 --> 21:13.858
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

21:13.996 --> 21:15.170
What is it, George?

21:15.653 --> 21:17.724
Well, uh...

21:17.862 --> 21:19.726
Me and Weezy have been
hearing this rumor

21:19.864 --> 21:21.314
that we might have to move
out of this building.

21:21.452 --> 21:23.592
Really? I have
to move out, too.

21:24.041 --> 21:25.145
You're jiving!

21:27.320 --> 21:28.942
Why would you have to move
out of your own building?

21:29.080 --> 21:32.394
George, Whitty here
doesn't own this building.

21:32.532 --> 21:35.673
You mean, you sold it?
Sold it? I never owned it.

21:35.811 --> 21:36.778
Well, how can that be?

21:36.916 --> 21:37.882
You're H.L. Whittendale,
ain't you?

21:38.020 --> 21:39.712
No, H.L. is my brother.

21:39.850 --> 21:42.611
You see, I've been sort of
staying up in his apartment
while he's out of town.

21:42.749 --> 21:44.475
But he wants me
out by tomorrow.

21:44.613 --> 21:46.546
That's what Ralph
came up to tell me.

21:46.684 --> 21:49.204
Your own brother
throwing you out.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.103
Yeah, you might say
I'm the black sheep
of the family.

21:52.241 --> 21:53.415
I wouldn't say that.

21:56.901 --> 21:59.041
I finished
law school years ago
and passed the bar,

21:59.179 --> 22:01.250
and I haven't passed
another bar since.

22:03.563 --> 22:06.463
Oh, Lord. We're in
trouble now, Weezy.

22:06.601 --> 22:08.603
Whittendale's gonna throw
us out of here for sure.

22:08.741 --> 22:11.606
Well, how can my brother
throw you out? Don't you
have a lease?

22:11.744 --> 22:13.677
Yeah, but it expires
next month.

22:13.815 --> 22:17.508
Your brother wants to
lease our apartment
to friends of his.

22:17.646 --> 22:20.442
Wait a minute, George,
didn't you tell me

22:20.580 --> 22:22.582
that you have
a cleaning store
in this building?

22:22.720 --> 22:25.102
That's right. And I got
a 10-year contract. Why?

22:25.240 --> 22:27.380
Because there's a clause
here which means

22:27.518 --> 22:30.279
that as long as your
store lease is in effect,

22:30.418 --> 22:32.868
you cannot be forced
to leave your apartment.

22:33.006 --> 22:35.215
You sure?
Oh, certainly I'm sure.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.080
I got straight A's
in contract law.

22:38.218 --> 22:40.911
You mean, we don't have
to leave our apartment?

22:41.049 --> 22:42.430
Not unless you want to.

22:42.568 --> 22:44.949
Oh, that's wonderful!

22:45.087 --> 22:47.849
Hey, hey,
old Whitty saved the day.
What about that, Weez?

22:47.987 --> 22:49.885
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Whittendale.

22:50.023 --> 22:51.818
Okay. Oh, don't mention it.

22:51.956 --> 22:53.337
Well, I better be going.

22:53.475 --> 22:57.859
Oh, uh, George,
about that $300
you gave me...

22:57.997 --> 22:59.447
Oh, forget it.

22:59.585 --> 23:01.863
No, no, no, I can't, I can't.
I'll tell you what I will do.

23:02.001 --> 23:04.728
I will subtract it from
the legal fees you owe me.

23:05.211 --> 23:06.419
Legal fees?

23:06.557 --> 23:08.801
Yeah, for the advice
I just gave you.

23:10.078 --> 23:11.769
You mean, you're gonna
charge me for that?

23:11.907 --> 23:13.357
Only $500.

23:14.289 --> 23:16.602
So you just
owe me $200.

23:17.499 --> 23:19.915
Pay him, George.
It was worth it.

23:20.847 --> 23:22.124
Yeah, it sure was.

23:23.091 --> 23:24.195
Here.

23:25.542 --> 23:27.716
Thanks. You know,
I better be careful.

23:27.854 --> 23:31.548
If business keeps up like
this, I might have to pay
taxes this year.

23:33.066 --> 23:35.068
Well, I was certainly glad
to be able to help you.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.001
Well, so long, George.
Oh!

23:38.624 --> 23:40.073
Ah! Gotcha again!

23:41.937 --> 23:45.285
You know, frankly,
I don't know why you
want this apartment.

23:45.976 --> 23:47.460
It's crawling with ants.

23:58.126 --> 24:00.404
Well, I'm glad
that's settled.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.441
We won't have to
move after all.

24:02.579 --> 24:04.063
Yeah, and you know
what else is great?

24:04.201 --> 24:05.858
We still got the rest
of the day together.

24:05.996 --> 24:07.584
Yeah...

24:09.344 --> 24:10.483
Ow!

24:10.621 --> 24:11.864
What's wrong?

24:12.002 --> 24:14.176
I think another
ant just bit me.

24:14.314 --> 24:16.213
Well, you can't blame
the ants, Weezy.

24:16.351 --> 24:18.629
It ain't too often
they find something
as sweet as you.

24:21.183 --> 24:23.496
Oh, George...

24:49.418 --> 24:53.112
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
