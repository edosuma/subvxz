WEBVTT

00:01.359 --> 00:04.119
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all

00:04.120 --> 00:08.119
about knowing fuck all about owt
needs to watch their back.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.519
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.520 --> 00:13.279
sending prices sky-high.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.799
Literally, literally,
taking the grass from its own roots.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.999
Now you've got your condemnation.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.759
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.239
Have we had a national
fucking stroke, or what?

00:27.240 --> 00:31.119
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:31.120 --> 00:33.639
Anybody watching needs to know

00:33.640 --> 00:37.079
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.399
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.400 --> 00:43.279
and they charge us for water!?

00:43.280 --> 00:47.279
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.199
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:51.200 --> 00:52.279
Fuckin' bastard!

00:52.280 --> 00:54.279
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:54.280 --> 00:57.079
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.762 --> 00:59.962
This is our England now.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.239
Paaaarty!

60 seconds a minute,
60 minutes in an hour,

01:23.760 --> 01:27.719
24 hours in a day,
seven days a week,

01:27.720 --> 01:33.519
four weeks in a month,
and 1,000 months in a lifetime.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.959
Dead man walking.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.239
That's all, if you're lucky.

01:40.680 --> 01:41.719
Dead man walking.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.599
Ha ha ha ha! Boo!

01:44.600 --> 01:49.599
Tick them off on the calendar.
Count 'em down, one by one.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.139
One life to squeeze in all
the fucking and fighting

01:54.280 --> 01:57.349
and drinking and loving
and living you can.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.875
Hiya, sweet cheeks! Ooh, yeah.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.399
Stick it in me, you fucking wimp!

02:06.600 --> 02:08.359
Dead man walking.

02:09.160 --> 02:14.559
But they won't let you live.
They want to smother you...

02:16.720 --> 02:18.839
...to damn you,

02:19.340 --> 02:24.739
condemn you to fucking work.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.279
One thousand measly months
constitute a life,

02:30.320 --> 02:34.919
and they sentence you
to employment.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.679
Me, employment?

02:42.280 --> 02:45.839
Dead. Man. Walking.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.079
Given your lifetime of
inactivity,

02:49.080 --> 02:50.919
under the new Government guidelines,

02:50.920 --> 02:54.919
I now have no license whatsoever to
label you unfit for work any more.

02:57.252 --> 03:00.577
Feigning mental illness won't work
either, Mr Gallagher.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.959
Fucking hell. It's immoral.
Thrown to the lions.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.204
It's going cold!

03:13.268 --> 03:15.926
I loved my first job.

03:16.581 --> 03:20.709
Cutie little parlour maid in a big
house off O'Connell Street.

03:21.528 --> 03:22.755
Pretty uniform.

03:24.162 --> 03:28.832
The master used to tamper with me
after Mass on Sunday

03:29.083 --> 03:31.462
while his wife delivered scones
to the poorhouse.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.886
Means there's one less job
for the school leavers.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.425
The job he's going to get
isn't one you'll want to do.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.788
Yeah, cos there's going
to be loads of them about

03:40.000 --> 03:40.439
Eh!

03:40.440 --> 03:41.573
Whatever.

03:46.640 --> 03:51.228
And can you give us two packs of
the green papers? Small ones.

03:53.877 --> 03:55.290
You're putting away
a lot of weed, aren't you?

03:55.300 --> 03:57.279
The skins are Mimi's, OK?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.839
Cos she knows buying them
makes me feel like a tramp.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.759
Ours is guaranteed to hit
the spot quicker.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.559
What, in a "Mike Tyson
and foreplay" kind of way yeah?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.479
Here you are, there's your stuff.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.478
<i>I'm not looking to date rape you,
this stuff is 100% legit.</i>

04:17.560 --> 04:20.519
<i>If you feel drowsy, blind
money back.</i>

04:20.519 --> 04:22.399
You don't know what you're missing,
love.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.142
You'll come round.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.079
You have to stop fucking
with the formula.

04:31.080 --> 04:35.079
You see, that, right there.
That's the difference between us.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.559
We should be looking to leave
a legacy. Create a work of art.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.166
How do you think all the timeless
liqueurs got invented, eh?

04:42.493 --> 04:44.534
Drambuie, Cointreau, Tia Maria?

04:46.160 --> 04:47.799
One fine day it'll be,

04:47.800 --> 04:50.479
"a pint of lager
and a Shane and Jackson, please"

04:50.480 --> 04:52.079
"A Shane and Jackson"?

04:52.080 --> 04:55.879
Yeah, we'll create a design classic.
Like snakebite and black,

04:55.880 --> 04:57.879
Sex On The Beach, Black and Tan.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why not "a Jackson and Shane?"

05:00.320 --> 05:01.879
Alphabetical.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.319
No, it's not.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.439
Er, vowels!

05:04.440 --> 05:05.879
I've got an A in mine.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.879
Well, I've got both,
A and E. Fuck off.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.519
Where's the Marmite?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.078
Oh, fucking hell.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.119
Oh, here we go, Al Capone with
another crate of Absolut Piss.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.218
Oh, fucking comedian.

05:25.022 --> 05:28.021
Fucking hell, that is 'anging.
It's even worse than the last lot.

05:28.021 --> 05:30.040
Told you. You need patience
to get it right, mate.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.230
And are you going to sit there
all day, are you?

05:32.260 --> 05:34.359
Fucking drip, drip, drip, drip?

05:34.360 --> 05:38.359
I will.
I can't get hurt doing that, can I?

05:38.360 --> 05:39.879
It's no place for a mammy's boy.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.639
Such a chore spending time together?

05:41.640 --> 05:44.919
No, course not. It's just...
stretch my legs now and then.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.999
We don't need anyone else.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.419
I say we do.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.959
What if I cover half his wages?

05:49.960 --> 05:53.079
Sounds good to me.
Billy, you're on.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.119
Really?!

05:54.320 --> 05:56.039
Be careful out there.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.839
Yes! Ha ha!

05:57.840 --> 05:59.254
Thanks, Mam.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.352
Psst! Hey, pssst.
What are you in for, sweetheart?

06:13.359 --> 06:15.552
Fuck all. I'm wrongly convicted.

06:15.640 --> 06:21.218
We're all wrongly convicted!
The system's got it in for us.

06:22.169 --> 06:26.997
Ey, don't lump me in with you.
I'm a political prisoner.

06:27.120 --> 06:32.259
Direct casualty. Coalition of
the dick-less, Iggle-Piggle Cameron

06:32.380 --> 06:34.659
and the Last Ever Leader
of the Liberal Party.

06:34.720 --> 06:39.397
Not an idea nor a sexual organ
between them. I'm different.

06:39.902 --> 06:41.608
We're all different!

06:44.640 --> 06:49.058
Life as you know it is over.
You're finished.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.091
I'll be free any day.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.284
There's only one way out of here,
mucker.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.120
Ready...

07:06.360 --> 07:08.176
...take aim...

07:10.760 --> 07:12.159
...FIRE!

07:16.040 --> 07:17.481
Mr Gallagher?

07:18.144 --> 07:19.104
Mr Gallagher?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.872
You find anything interesting today?

07:32.956 --> 07:37.674
Er... yeah, plenty. Y'know, it's
just man in my condition...

07:38.784 --> 07:40.780
Isn't the measure
of a civilised society

07:40.920 --> 07:42.185
how well it looks after
its raspberries?

07:42.280 --> 07:45.573
Compared to most of the world,
we provide exemplary care.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.799
Yeah, but how can anyone be
100%, eh?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.439
Except you're deemed fully fit.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.439
"Empathy and Understanding"
new Government guidelines.

07:55.780 --> 07:59.779
How we gently nurture the long-term
unemployed back to the workplace.

08:00.120 --> 08:04.119
You're now my personal mission.
And I'm your champion.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.719
Just sign there, Francis.
This is to say you're fit for work.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.310
Frank?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.199
Why won't you sign?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.524
You will not defeat me.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.479
I will not be defeated.
You cannot contain me!

08:27.440 --> 08:31.341
I am Frank Gallagher.
I am a free man.

08:49.799 --> 08:50.833
No touching!

08:51.238 --> 08:51.829
They're going off.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.019
Well not enough.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.339
These are the wash,
getting ready for the still.

08:56.340 --> 08:59.619
Vodka, rum, molasses,
with a Maguire twist of cinnamon,

08:59.620 --> 09:02.379
cloves and ginger. The barrels
are the volume, the basics,

09:02.380 --> 09:04.259
where we earn
most of the readies, but...

09:04.260 --> 09:07.539
These are my fucking babies.

09:07.540 --> 09:08.859
What's in them?

09:08.860 --> 09:10.539
Oak chips.

09:10.540 --> 09:14.539
Ethyl nitrate, lactose concentrate,
yeast enzymes...

09:15.462 --> 09:16.060
additives.

09:16.300 --> 09:20.139
Collection commences
between 110 and 115 degrees.

09:20.140 --> 09:23.339
Keep an eye on the temperature and
burn a sample every other hour.

09:23.340 --> 09:26.659
But basically, all we need you for
is to stir or shake.

09:26.660 --> 09:29.219
That every hour.
And froth these babies...

09:29.220 --> 09:32.899
harder than your bellend.
All of them. Every two hours.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.609
No problemo.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.975
Nectar...

09:45.020 --> 09:46.499
Not bad...

09:46.500 --> 09:49.619
Yeah. Well drink more than
a thimbleful at this stage

09:49.620 --> 09:52.346
and your liver'll
shrivel like a walnut.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.579
You going to be all right?

09:55.580 --> 09:56.523
Yeah, man.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.467
Owww, fuck!

10:02.855 --> 10:05.269
I'll take double this time.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.259
Not happening, Patty
get too fond of these,

10:08.260 --> 10:11.939
and before you know it you'll be
clucking like some desperate junkie.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.619
Huh, like it could
ever come to that.

10:14.820 --> 10:18.019
Next thing you'll be giving noshes
for a tenner in Whalley Range.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.779
Chance would be a fine thing.
I'd pay them!

10:20.780 --> 10:23.659
But if you just give me double now,

10:23.660 --> 10:27.659
then, if I know I have some in stock
it saves coming here as much.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.699
You know, in case you're not home...

10:29.700 --> 10:33.699
One week's worth.
And when they're gone, I'll be here.

10:36.820 --> 10:39.819
You give Sylvia Staples
twice as much as me.

10:39.820 --> 10:43.019
She won't see Christmas.
They're easing her past the post.

10:43.020 --> 10:45.419
I've got the constitution of an ox.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.234
Mad cow if you don't watch it.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.792
Glass of water?

10:56.820 --> 10:57.989
Thank you.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.991
Melt those stresses away
like a bath of asses' milk.

11:05.780 --> 11:07.486
I'm keeping an eye on you.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.947
I've never seen that old
boot in such good spirits.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.566
Hey, One Direction,
got a proposition for you.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.539
Your lucky day, me old china.

11:28.115 --> 11:28.814
Forget it, Frank.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.931
What, come on,
where's your business instinct?

11:31.480 --> 11:32.219
Protecting me from you.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.293
It's not just money... you know?

11:34.318 --> 11:36.848
It's just produce, you know.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.165
Skunk, resin, Mary Jane.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.790
Lay some on us.
I'll pay you tomorrow.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.462
After you've smoked it? No chance.

11:41.671 --> 11:42.969
I'm going to sell it, honest...

11:43.423 --> 11:45.236
Oh come on,
Escobar started somewhere!

11:47.101 --> 11:48.879
Oh, fuck the lot of you, then.

11:51.531 --> 11:52.766
I'm dropping out.

11:52.831 --> 11:55.304
Dropping out of what?
You're not even a part of anything.

11:56.696 --> 11:58.283
I'm going to live off the grid.

11:58.340 --> 11:59.619
The steel things in the street?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.259
No, self-sustenance...

12:02.176 --> 12:03.851
y'know, solar panels,
grow some spuds,

12:04.855 --> 12:06.541
chickens for free eggs,

12:06.679 --> 12:08.394
wind turbines in the garden...

12:08.489 --> 12:10.926
sell the extra leccy
back to the rapists

12:11.330 --> 12:15.032
who should never have earned out of
its privatisation in the first place.

12:19.860 --> 12:20.939
Off the grid? You?

12:21.963 --> 12:23.544
What choice do I have?

12:23.900 --> 12:26.339
I am not built to comply.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.779
I cannot force my soul to...
wage slavery.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.059
How would I breathe?

12:31.160 --> 12:32.819
Same as everyone else.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.819
Exactly my fucking point!

12:34.820 --> 12:37.059
You're all dead from the neck up...

12:37.160 --> 12:40.959
slabs of meat, serving the Great Gods
Profit and Progress...

12:43.420 --> 12:45.699
Oh, yeah, yeah, go on, laugh it up...

12:46.100 --> 12:49.299
maybe pull out your night-stick
and your gun, anything so you don't

12:49.300 --> 12:52.099
have to think for yourself.
That's why they give 'em you.

12:52.100 --> 12:55.503
You'll submit, everyone does.

12:57.204 --> 12:59.790
Keep the flesh obedient,

13:00.100 --> 13:03.739
performing, but scour out the man,

13:03.740 --> 13:05.631
the very soul.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.419
That's your lot, not mine.

13:07.620 --> 13:12.119
Anything to avoid
taking responsibility, eh?

13:12.940 --> 13:16.192
Any straw you can clutch.

13:17.180 --> 13:18.941
I will leave here.

13:19.692 --> 13:21.275
Survive on my wits.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.467
On your wits?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.910
You almost had me going there...

13:30.260 --> 13:32.139
your wits!

13:32.140 --> 13:34.275
I am a survivor.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.326
I am renegade.

14:45.149 --> 14:46.134
Booosh!

14:51.407 --> 14:52.134
Frank!

14:55.886 --> 14:56.816
That was our tea!

14:58.458 --> 15:01.334
How does "living off the grid"
translate as "taking what you want"?

15:02.287 --> 15:03.763
In time, Kelly.

15:03.860 --> 15:06.659
When has a potato ever
grown under concrete flags?

15:06.660 --> 15:07.899
So dig them up.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.379
I'm onto it...

15:09.380 --> 15:12.179
Irish Macka's lending me a shovel.

15:12.180 --> 15:13.265
He's taking the piss.

15:16.184 --> 15:17.042
And a glass of wine.

15:25.878 --> 15:26.946
I'll fix him!

15:42.660 --> 15:45.099
This is fucking illegal!

15:46.228 --> 15:47.153
We're in the middle of nowhere.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.759
All the more reason to keep it
fucking down, then!

15:50.860 --> 15:54.052
Shhhh. Benchill Polish Club.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.428
Could be the biggy.
Ziggy...

15:57.500 --> 15:59.461
Jak sie masz...?

15:59.522 --> 16:01.490
How's it going, bud?
Good to hear from you.

16:01.820 --> 16:04.739
Stress levels that high,
no wonder this is piss.

16:04.740 --> 16:05.804
Tell me about it.

16:09.020 --> 16:10.139
Out of ten?

16:11.259 --> 16:12.176
My own recipe.

16:12.253 --> 16:12.980
Not bad...

16:15.340 --> 16:16.680
Fuck me, that's tasty.

16:19.460 --> 16:20.800
Oh, aye...?

16:22.100 --> 16:23.299
Well?

16:23.300 --> 16:25.044
Said it tasted worse.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.958
Philistines!

16:28.000 --> 16:29.548
They don't deserve it anyway.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.111
What about... this?

16:42.060 --> 16:43.379
Which one's this?

16:43.380 --> 16:46.059
Needs to blend a few more days
before we put it in the still.

16:46.060 --> 16:48.119
I told you not to touch anything!

16:48.120 --> 16:50.519
Oi! I'm glad he did. This is mint!

16:50.620 --> 16:54.119
It's fennel, actually.
With a bit of basil and nutmeg.

17:04.416 --> 17:06.904
I told that useless bitch
this would happen.

17:07.404 --> 17:08.659
Oh, fuck!

17:12.070 --> 17:13.911
What are you thinking of?!

17:14.396 --> 17:15.672
This shite's poison!

17:16.968 --> 17:18.751
Keep it out of reach, then.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.259
I'm a 21st century man,

17:24.460 --> 17:28.459
not designed to live
off the fucking land.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.075
Whatever happened to green belt?

17:40.740 --> 17:42.779
I can't eat me own young.

17:42.780 --> 17:45.659
I'm not a Scotsman, or a Scouser.

17:45.660 --> 17:49.179
I'm a fucking blue,
a league champion.

17:49.180 --> 17:51.954
Welcome to Manchester!

18:01.620 --> 18:03.292
What doesn't kill you...

18:09.975 --> 18:11.617
I'll absolve you for a favour.

18:11.994 --> 18:13.075
I'd rather be grounded.

18:13.340 --> 18:14.510
Get to your room then.

18:14.849 --> 18:15.468
Yeah, right.

18:17.540 --> 18:19.339
It's a really easy favour.

18:20.271 --> 18:21.278
I'll pay you.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.541
Handsomely.

18:32.699 --> 18:33.361
Marty!

18:33.615 --> 18:34.836
Come on I'm hungry!

18:34.860 --> 18:36.215
Marty!

18:39.134 --> 18:40.515
Fuck you all, then...

18:52.400 --> 18:54.679
I promise you, honestly.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.053
Booze For Buttons are
definitely interested.

19:00.980 --> 19:04.979
The bird was all over me.
I'm outside Off Your Box now.

19:05.620 --> 19:06.659
All right...

19:06.660 --> 19:09.059
Spare any change, mate.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.259
Frank...?

19:12.260 --> 19:14.059
By name and nature,

19:14.060 --> 19:16.379
on the grill and griddle.

19:16.380 --> 19:20.379
A pound'll do.
Or buy us a can, the good stuff.

19:22.170 --> 19:23.898
Jesus, Frank.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.859
C'mon.

19:26.856 --> 19:27.862
Give us your hand.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.059
Laters, guys. See ya.

19:34.060 --> 19:35.055
Behave!

19:36.580 --> 19:38.979
Don't think you're
trying anything on.

19:38.980 --> 19:39.954
Don't flatter yourself.

19:40.757 --> 19:41.933
We'll get more done if we split up.

19:55.249 --> 19:56.384
Just dropped my pen.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.179
Why didn't you just ask?

19:59.580 --> 20:03.579
Her and Dad think I'm stupid.

20:07.679 --> 20:08.875
Are they for you or Patty?

20:09.250 --> 20:09.942
Patty.

20:15.252 --> 20:16.534
Err... it costs.

20:18.734 --> 20:19.915
That's all she gave me.

20:26.057 --> 20:28.411
Dead. Man. Walking!

20:30.700 --> 20:33.299
You're shit. Not capable!

20:33.300 --> 20:37.499
You're condemned,
just like everybody else.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.144
Leave me alone!

20:44.960 --> 20:49.757
Valiant effort, but you can't
stand in the way of progress.

20:52.660 --> 20:56.659
Sentence will be carried out,
there's nothing you can do.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.916
Oh, yes there fucking is...

21:01.900 --> 21:03.979
At least you're happy.

21:03.980 --> 21:06.899
With you on disability,
we know there's something coming in.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.259
You're sure this isn't easier?

21:09.260 --> 21:11.859
Less pain, but less effective.

21:11.860 --> 21:15.739
They can stitch an Achilles,
tie all sorts of cartilage together,

21:15.740 --> 21:18.299
have you fully functioning
in under a year.

21:18.300 --> 21:22.299
But shattering your kneecap
fucks you right up.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.299
Guaranteed to leave a limp.

21:32.260 --> 21:35.295
So it goes through
the back of the knee.

21:36.140 --> 21:40.163
How we took care of
joyriders back home.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.619
When you're re...

21:56.780 --> 21:57.939
Hillbillies!
Who was it?!

21:58.220 --> 22:00.339
She missed.
How could she fucking miss?!

22:00.540 --> 22:01.579
She's passed out!

22:01.580 --> 22:03.189
Where is he?

22:06.300 --> 22:10.299
No! No! Frank! Get off. Frank!

22:22.700 --> 22:25.152
So glad to see you.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.935
Dead. Man. Walking.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.279
I'd neck that all day.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.319
Sarsasparilla's
an aphrodisiac for birds.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.599
Mix with a bit of ginseng.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.359
Is your nose extra strong?

22:39.360 --> 22:40.839
Just hyper-sensitive.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.799
Got battered for being
a freak in infants.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.839
Kept crying every time this fat,
trampy kid walked in the room.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.359
Soon learned to keep quiet though.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.298
Does everything smell clearer?

22:52.880 --> 22:55.959
Tesco lemon and almond shampoo,
Dove natural for men body wash,

22:55.960 --> 22:58.759
Gillette sandalwood shaving gel,
Lynx Temptation deodorant,

22:58.760 --> 23:01.519
Paco Rabanne after shave,
MacLean ice-white toothpaste,

23:01.520 --> 23:04.079
clothes washed in Persil,
forest fresh non-bio...

23:04.080 --> 23:08.079
Shirt, two days ago.
Jeans, yesterday...

23:09.240 --> 23:11.999
It's alright most of the time,
just breathe through my mouth.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.039
Gets a bit tricky though,
'cause Mimi's loves getting plated.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.039
Well, Benchill Polish Club
are back on.

23:18.040 --> 23:22.039
Crumpsall Ukrainian Institute
and Hale Barns Irish.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.879
Now all we need to do
is work out the percentages.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.879
If I take my ball away, you two are
back to selling piss aren't you?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.719
As much you can supply.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.319
Every punter in Manchester's
gonna come my way.

23:44.320 --> 23:48.319
That's it. Sample's all gone.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.839
Do you have to sell to anyone else?

23:51.840 --> 23:53.279
Hey! Don't be greedy.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.239
Alright, there'll be plenty
to go round.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.519
You've brewed liquid gold.
I knew you'd come good.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.439
Here, deposit on 20 crates.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.479
And me.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.559
Whoa!

24:02.560 --> 24:04.799
Be fair, Shane.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.119
If it wasn't for Billy,

24:06.120 --> 24:08.692
these'd be pissing claret instead
of hanging out of each other.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.175
Special edition Ian Brown
pair next month.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.839
Eeeeww.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.279
What you playing at?!

24:16.280 --> 24:20.079
I'll show the world what filth
is living under my roof.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.399
Where did she get them?

24:22.400 --> 24:25.039
That's my washing,
you mental old bitch!

24:25.040 --> 24:28.479
All the bleach in China wouldn't
budge the stains on these.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.591
Do you know how much these cost?

24:29.800 --> 24:33.513
Oh, because,
I regularly buy such garments.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.399
Oh!

24:37.400 --> 24:41.399
Get your poison talons off me,
cos I know where they've been.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.839
No. You're in it together.
Three of you.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.879
See, hear, speak no evil.

24:48.880 --> 24:52.639
Think you can rohypnol me?!

24:52.640 --> 24:54.726
Fuck's up with her?

25:02.320 --> 25:04.319
Phone her doctor,
tell him she's taken the lot.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.934
Oh, shit.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.146
I'm only interested in your
well-being and getting you a job.

25:13.308 --> 25:15.501
50 positions have been created

25:15.566 --> 25:18.020
with the expansion
of Poundswick Hospital.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.679
It's natural to be nervous,
so we'll practise.

25:24.321 --> 25:27.340
Not often we get fish fingers
as a last request.

25:28.359 --> 25:29.996
Folk normally aim higher.

25:30.145 --> 25:30.887
Yeah, well...

25:32.440 --> 25:36.319
sound-track of my youth,
Captain Birdseye,

25:36.320 --> 25:40.319
old man with hands reeking of tuna,
beckoning kids to follow him.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.159
He'd be outed by red tops
these days,

25:43.160 --> 25:46.999
stoned to death,
next to a paediatrician. Besides,

25:47.000 --> 25:50.479
it is not my last meal.
I'm outta here.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.239
I thought you'd given in to
the inevitable?

25:52.240 --> 25:54.399
Fuck all's inevitable, Sparky.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.399
Governor's on his way down,
I'm on a last minute reprieve.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.999
On what grounds?

26:00.000 --> 26:03.959
On the grounds that you cannot keep
a good man down.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.599
The policy has not been devised,

26:06.600 --> 26:10.599
the prison not yet built,
that can contain me.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.719
What the fuck are you two
dressed like?

26:33.480 --> 26:36.118
Even more sinister. Cheap gear.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.526
Whoa! Stop!

26:55.040 --> 26:56.839
Only a few cockles. What?

26:58.040 --> 26:59.561
Shit job anyway!

27:02.440 --> 27:03.267
Vanilla pod.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.026
Shane, caramelise some sugar.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.199
Forget it!
Normal brown sugar will do.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.314
I'll get it.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.570
Getting there?

27:50.680 --> 27:51.604
More aniseed.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.159
We're out.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.999
Working with amateurs, man.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.360
I'm on it.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.457
Why doesn't Shane go?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.848
Go on! One more fucking word!

28:02.983 --> 28:03.539
Come on!

28:04.680 --> 28:06.840
Bit of fresh air will do you good.

28:20.258 --> 28:25.393
I'll burn your houses down,
you fecking orange shite.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.279
Where are we going?

28:32.280 --> 28:33.399
Nowhere.

28:33.400 --> 28:37.399
If you don't get me out of here
in ten seconds flat...

28:37.680 --> 28:39.439
It's for your own good.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.652
It's what?

28:44.457 --> 28:46.692
I might have known.

28:46.920 --> 28:50.359
I'll have you for false imprisonment
and kidnap.

28:50.360 --> 28:54.813
There's plenty of vits, minerals
and natural sustenance.

28:55.626 --> 28:57.519
There's bed pans, blankets

28:57.783 --> 28:59.918
and lots of water.
You're going to be thirsty.

29:00.446 --> 29:03.471
What's more, there's no getting out.
You're locked in.

29:04.037 --> 29:06.626
Do your bosses know you're
no better than some low-life,

29:06.871 --> 29:08.076
street-corner drug dealer?

29:09.762 --> 29:10.867
Don't listen to threats,

29:11.229 --> 29:13.643
don't listen to or pay attention
to any promises,

29:13.732 --> 29:15.836
and do not believe a word
that comes out of her mouth

29:15.936 --> 29:17.213
for the next 48 hours.

29:17.313 --> 29:18.078
Aidan...

29:18.929 --> 29:22.092
I'll buy you those new air max
you want, the Derren Brown ones.

29:22.339 --> 29:24.047
Don't even look in her eyes.

29:24.610 --> 29:28.211
We'll get United season tickets
and go to Spain for the weekend.

29:28.499 --> 29:29.898
Fuck off, Advil!

29:31.884 --> 29:34.671
Steal one more tablet
and you are next.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.439
Your grounding starts once
you help her get through this.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.314
Give us a hand.

29:38.339 --> 29:40.474
I'll have your drug...

29:41.703 --> 29:42.746
Get me out!

29:42.914 --> 29:44.910
Inside, now!

29:46.041 --> 29:48.582
There's a law against imprisonment
in this country you know,

29:48.582 --> 29:49.748
it's a criminal of fence!

29:59.524 --> 30:00.564
All right, Mr Governor.

30:00.998 --> 30:02.971
Bags are packed, I'm ready
to fucking roll.

30:06.787 --> 30:08.036
I'm sorry, Mr Gallagher.

30:08.998 --> 30:09.944
It's an election year.

30:11.612 --> 30:12.758
A Chinese election.

30:16.915 --> 30:17.820
Times are hard.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.553
Every man must face
his responsibilities.

30:21.755 --> 30:23.663
No reprieves, no exceptions.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.175
This is not how the story
ends for me.

30:28.308 --> 30:30.120
How gutted are you?

30:30.286 --> 30:32.426
Fish fingers was your last meal.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.075
Nah man, I'm telling you!

30:52.252 --> 30:52.642
Shut up.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.841
Billy, Shane and Jacksons.

30:53.994 --> 30:56.522
It's not cool enough.
It's got too many syllables.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.716
Why's my name always last?

30:57.716 --> 30:58.953
Especially if you order it
with lemonade.

30:59.095 --> 31:00.472
How you gonna order that
if you're pissed...?

31:00.472 --> 31:01.639
Fuck!

31:19.200 --> 31:23.199
Artic roll,
dripping in tinned pear juice.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.392
I tried.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.957
I really tried.

31:41.840 --> 31:42.924
It's just...

31:43.080 --> 31:45.891
Circumstances conspiring
against you?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.448
Exactly, circumstances.

31:48.527 --> 31:52.526
I am not fucking wired the way they
want, it's a miscarriage of justice.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.976
My fucking ball sack.

31:55.120 --> 31:59.119
There are no unique circumstances
or conspiracies.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.399
You sabotage it for yourself.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.359
Every opportunity, every time.

32:03.360 --> 32:06.239
The only thing that stops you
from standing up and being counted

32:06.240 --> 32:07.639
is your victim complex.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.879
Poor little fucking me.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.838
What the fuck's this?
Tag-team cuntish-ness?

32:16.580 --> 32:18.674
I cannot be a wage slave.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.464
Why everybody else

32:21.520 --> 32:22.769
and not you?

32:25.600 --> 32:27.780
I'm doing me best.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.639
I know you are. It's just proving
more difficult than I imagined.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.879
Listen, Frank,
if this one goes wrong,

32:36.880 --> 32:40.759
there's nothing more I can do.
The state will cut you off.

32:40.760 --> 32:43.679
No benefits ever again.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.925
It's your last chance, Frank.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.576
I wish I could tell you
you scrub up.

33:06.228 --> 33:07.662
It's time to make your peace, Frank.

33:08.034 --> 33:09.478
I'm an atheist.

33:10.902 --> 33:12.098
Are you sure?

33:15.147 --> 33:17.714
Well, there's no harm
in hedging your bets.

33:35.886 --> 33:36.905
Frank?

33:39.187 --> 33:41.254
It's a miracle
any of you walked away.

33:41.280 --> 33:44.077
I still say you should've gone
the 'ossie, to get checked out.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.625
You should've gone last night.

33:46.228 --> 33:47.098
You all right, love?

33:48.080 --> 33:49.870
I'm not sure
we need such a big team.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.639
Come on, Billy...

33:51.640 --> 33:52.999
Shane brought you into the game.

33:53.162 --> 33:54.779
I knew this little prick
were getting giddy.

33:55.038 --> 33:56.045
He's a liability.

33:56.911 --> 33:57.973
I could've died in there.

33:57.973 --> 34:00.765
Excuse me! If you didn't
have the music so fucking loud,

34:00.924 --> 34:03.008
you'd have heard it ready to blow,
wouldn't you?

34:03.238 --> 34:04.210
Yeah, you bellend. We did.

34:04.633 --> 34:05.678
So you're on his team now?

34:06.126 --> 34:06.948
I'm just saying.

34:06.980 --> 34:07.939
I want 70%.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.520
Fuck off!

34:19.320 --> 34:22.683
Good morning, my darling!
I feel great.

34:22.882 --> 34:25.275
And there's no need
to keep a little, harmless old lady

34:25.322 --> 34:26.290
locked up any more.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.107
I forgot my earplugs!

34:28.532 --> 34:30.690
I never told you,
I heard from your mum.

34:30.791 --> 34:32.101
Don't listen to her.

34:32.262 --> 34:32.964
Shut your mouth!

34:33.000 --> 34:34.074
She's been thinking about you.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.170
La-la-la-la-la!

34:35.170 --> 34:38.179
Seriously, she and your dad
are getting back together.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.149
They want to be a family again.

34:42.797 --> 34:44.149
You know she's lying.

34:51.103 --> 34:51.898
Out of order.

34:52.815 --> 34:54.732
What's it got to do with you,
you little fecking slag?

34:56.120 --> 35:00.430
Aidan! Come back here,
you motherless piece of shit!

35:00.854 --> 35:02.892
No wonder she left. Fuck you!

35:03.040 --> 35:05.599
He wouldn't have been able
to do it without you

35:05.600 --> 35:07.279
but it's his recipe

35:07.280 --> 35:09.112
and we all want more.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.177
Come on!

35:15.000 --> 35:17.901
Billy? We've sorted it.

35:22.922 --> 35:23.896
No hard feelings.

35:24.154 --> 35:26.328
No, no hard feelings.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.259
Fucking hell! Shane!

35:29.760 --> 35:31.497
I fucking knew it!

35:34.628 --> 35:35.816
Oh me baby.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.587
What have they said?

35:39.626 --> 35:40.397
Can you smell that?

35:40.568 --> 35:41.534
Does it look like it?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.458
Stays on for 48 hours.

35:43.458 --> 35:46.496
48 hours? Let's get you home, love.

35:46.581 --> 35:47.762
Shit mate, you're joking.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.183
The world has changed
these last half-dozen years, Frank.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.700
Every one of us
must bear the burden.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.871
Not me.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.984
Half of Europe's bankrupt,
below the poverty line.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.350
The easy life is over,
the Baby Boomers spent it all.

36:04.508 --> 36:06.177
They didn't spend mine.

36:07.305 --> 36:09.517
I am not meant to graft

36:09.840 --> 36:12.319
and pay bills, and save pennies

36:12.320 --> 36:16.039
and dole my life out in drips
and drops from a fucking pipette.

36:16.040 --> 36:16.799
Why?

36:16.800 --> 36:20.399
Because it is fucking dull!

36:20.400 --> 36:22.159
Because I am better than that.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.799
Some people are born to obey.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.737
I was born to think...

36:28.520 --> 36:32.104
...dream, indulge, absorb.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.239
So you are better
than the working man?

36:34.240 --> 36:37.216
Of course I fucking am!

36:37.680 --> 36:40.287
See? Look!

36:43.280 --> 36:45.999
Frank. You're a snob.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.279
Let them scurry around. I will not.

36:51.920 --> 36:55.479
The tide is coming in,
whether you like it or not.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.422
It's time.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.279
That clock's slow. Shut it, Lillian.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.540
His health's more important
than your punters' hard-ons.

37:19.400 --> 37:23.079
We wait no less than the 48 hours.

37:24.632 --> 37:25.628
How's it feeling, mate?

37:26.756 --> 37:27.693
Still pretty numb.

37:39.982 --> 37:40.760
Is it working?

37:40.907 --> 37:43.064
Fucking hell. A bit, yeah.

37:44.332 --> 37:45.060
Deodorant?

37:45.176 --> 37:45.667
Lynx.

37:45.795 --> 37:47.615
Scent?
Temptation.

37:48.492 --> 37:49.154
Cool Metal!

37:49.160 --> 37:50.924
At least he got the brand right.

37:50.965 --> 37:52.307
He knows I was wearing it before.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.479
Talk to me. Eh!

37:55.480 --> 37:57.359
Let her do it! Wait.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.159
I think...

37:59.160 --> 38:00.479
There's talc...

38:00.480 --> 38:01.599
Powder?

38:01.600 --> 38:02.826
I think so.

38:05.418 --> 38:06.531
Johnson's Baby Powder?

38:06.853 --> 38:09.251
Vagisil. This clown's lost it.

38:11.015 --> 38:12.044
Satisfied?

38:13.592 --> 38:14.916
You remember the recipe, though?

38:21.760 --> 38:23.319
What? Billy?

38:23.320 --> 38:24.919
You remember, or it's working?

38:24.920 --> 38:26.919
Fresh air! In here?

38:26.920 --> 38:28.719
I can smell fresh air.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.919
I don't have to breathe
through my mouth any more.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.159
Now you're real-I-lly
in for a treat.

38:36.520 --> 38:38.312
Eh, fucking hell, Mam!

38:49.959 --> 38:51.233
Dead man walking!

38:56.305 --> 38:57.196
Knock 'em dead.

38:59.739 --> 39:00.500
Good luck, Frank.

39:01.519 --> 39:03.080
Dead man walking!

39:33.066 --> 39:34.502
Is there any chance
of a last-minute...?

39:34.826 --> 39:35.944
You know, turn a blind eye...?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.000
Your life is over, Frank.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.285
I am sorry.

39:55.410 --> 39:56.190
Ready?

40:01.008 --> 40:02.170
Take aim.

40:05.418 --> 40:06.590
Any last words?

40:08.806 --> 40:10.104
Any last words?

40:12.132 --> 40:12.935
W- would...

40:15.532 --> 40:16.272
Would...

40:18.000 --> 40:19.879
Would you like fries with that?

40:20.200 --> 40:21.156
What?

40:21.984 --> 40:23.677
Would you like fries with that?

40:29.700 --> 40:30.257
Sorry.

40:30.913 --> 40:31.734
Sorry, mate.

40:33.426 --> 40:34.412
Who's Wesley?

40:35.400 --> 40:36.919
Oh, you must be joking.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.359
My sentiments exactly. However...

40:39.360 --> 40:41.079
Late again, first verbal.

40:42.262 --> 40:42.765
Fuck's sake!

40:42.765 --> 40:46.512
How's it my fault if two fat parcels
got stuck in the door on the 105?

40:46.956 --> 40:50.648
Bad language on the premises.
That is your first verbal.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.636
Are you taking the piss?
Come on, mate.

40:53.862 --> 40:56.104
We'll never attain that relationship.

40:59.228 --> 41:00.186
I don't like you.

41:00.386 --> 41:01.876
What?
I don't want you working here.

41:02.563 --> 41:04.740
You swear again... written warning.

41:05.540 --> 41:08.058
I'd be happy to see the back of you
before you begin.

41:14.732 --> 41:15.245
Darren,

41:15.280 --> 41:16.860
would you eat a burger
made with these?

41:19.662 --> 41:21.364
Show Catweazle his locker,

41:21.407 --> 41:24.186
get him scrubbed,
then let him loose on the toilets.

41:24.498 --> 41:25.711
Wesley, your hash browns are ready.

41:25.759 --> 41:26.935
Well, box them up, then.

41:27.751 --> 41:29.703
Come on, teamsters!

41:33.720 --> 41:35.012
Back to normal?

41:35.040 --> 41:36.450
Of course!

41:39.510 --> 41:40.740
She will be by now.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.639
And you think any of this
was really necessary?

41:46.640 --> 41:48.159
Don't play games, Patty.

41:49.030 --> 41:50.847
I was always in control.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.039
What?

41:53.040 --> 41:54.879
You don't remember
the things you said?

41:54.880 --> 41:57.319
I told you that wouldn't be
the real Patty, didn't I?

41:57.320 --> 41:58.802
Sounded real enough to me.

42:02.040 --> 42:05.119
I remember asking to be let out.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.639
Kelly's knickers?

42:06.640 --> 42:07.839
What about them?

42:07.840 --> 42:09.519
Nothing about Aidan's mam?

42:09.520 --> 42:11.257
Have you heard from her?

42:12.631 --> 42:14.203
Never again, Patty.

42:16.978 --> 42:18.291
What are they on about?

42:19.848 --> 42:23.212
You know I'd never hurt a fly.

42:27.350 --> 42:29.398
Look, lot of fuss about nothing.

42:31.880 --> 42:35.125
Push me to Chesney's.
We could do with some sherry.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.594
Oh! Here you go.

42:47.699 --> 42:49.320
That's a worthwhile sight.

42:51.344 --> 42:52.145
You reckon?

42:52.225 --> 42:54.889
I'm proud of you.
You're a natural.

42:55.769 --> 42:57.015
What, at cleaning shit?

42:57.544 --> 43:01.326
Work hard, you'll have your face
up there in no time.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.762
Coffee, please.

43:11.953 --> 43:13.587
Another success story.

43:20.096 --> 43:20.810
Cheers.

43:40.640 --> 43:42.491
Yeah, yeah. Pint of lager.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.359
And would you like to go
large with that?

43:44.873 --> 43:46.326
Showin' your face at last?

43:46.652 --> 43:48.753
So what's it like in the land
of the straight-goer eh?

43:48.755 --> 43:50.593
Yes, boss, no, boss, anything else, boss?

43:50.691 --> 43:52.316
Who you going to shag
at the Christmas do?

44:02.792 --> 44:05.700
There's nothing like
a hard-earned pint.

44:27.887 --> 44:29.980
Don't forget,
we're all free up here.

44:30.408 --> 44:31.988
They can never crush the spirit.

44:39.440 --> 44:42.200
"Thank you, Uncle Frank!"

44:42.800 --> 44:45.407
How long can you rage
against the machine?

44:45.920 --> 44:47.984
Against the dying of the light?

44:49.280 --> 44:53.079
No man can live
entirely alone, isolated...

44:53.320 --> 44:55.512
maybe two centuries ago,
but not now.

44:56.160 --> 45:00.999
The long arm of "progress",
of the law, is all-pervasive.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.839
So, what to do?

45:05.433 --> 45:08.044
Do we all, finally, conform?

45:11.118 --> 45:12.193
Submit?

45:16.446 --> 45:18.965
Do we fuck. You bring the fuckers
down from the inside.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.048
Let them think they've won
and just when they least expect it...

45:22.400 --> 45:25.346
...we, the people, will rise.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.379
Not that I'm one of you,
you uneducated twats,

45:29.524 --> 45:30.320
but you get the gist.

45:34.414 --> 45:36.523
There's more than one way
to skin a society.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.279
50 quid for a moggy.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.719
Here, 50 quid!

45:42.269 --> 45:43.702
Wait up, Frank.
You're not on the counter today.

45:44.085 --> 45:44.940
World of Burgers,

45:45.020 --> 45:47.539
chicken deal.
World of Burgers, meal deal.

45:47.740 --> 45:49.659
He's wrecking the place! Look!

45:49.760 --> 45:51.079
That one's actually not bad.

45:51.080 --> 45:52.999
Welcome to management, Frank.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.719
So what? You may not be the greatest
mother in the world. Who is?

45:55.720 --> 45:59.159
The second you think you know the answers
is the second you fuck it all up.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.239
Cilla! Cilla!

46:00.440 --> 46:03.003
Get on the fucking floor now!

46:43.841 --> 46:46.232
The only thing
a smell test will prove

46:46.320 --> 46:48.119
is that you can't tell
shite from sugar.

46:49.274 --> 46:49.770
Ready?

46:52.080 --> 46:53.119
Little hint of vanilla, maybe.

46:53.419 --> 46:54.785
Go on. Dash of lime.

46:56.098 --> 46:56.935

47:00.960 --> 47:01.774
Barley.

47:01.800 --> 47:02.969
Well done!

47:04.300 --> 47:05.256
It's only cabbage.

47:06.900 --> 47:08.678
That was like a fucking sniffer dog!
