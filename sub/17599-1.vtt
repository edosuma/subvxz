WEBVTT

01:08.986 --> 01:10.943
- You're very strong.
- OK, push!

01:12.364 --> 01:15.402
This is the last holiday I'm ever
going on with you.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.612
Where'd you get all those muscles?

01:17.661 --> 01:20.529
- Come on.
- More, more, more!

01:20.581 --> 01:23.198
- Don't quit now.
- How much further?

01:23.250 --> 01:26.163
It's only a couple million more miles.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.622
A couple of what?

01:27.671 --> 01:30.163
Couple million more miles!

01:30.215 --> 01:33.299
Now, right up here we're gonna stop.
Keep pushing. Don't quit.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.754
Mexico next time.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.090
- Hawaii's better.
- Yeah!

01:38.348 --> 01:39.964
Whoa-ho!

01:40.017 --> 01:42.179
Hold it, hold it. That's good.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.482
Phew!

01:50.527 --> 01:51.734
Now what are you going to do?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.815
- I'm gonna try to get us some...
- Help?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.526
Help.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.203
Come on. Let's have a snowball fight.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.455
Oh, no! No!

02:06.335 --> 02:10.329
Daddy! Daddy! Come on! Help me, Daddy!

02:10.380 --> 02:11.791
Ow!

02:23.143 --> 02:26.727
Yes, do you have the number for
Emergency Road Service?

04:59.382 --> 05:00.623
Thank you, Stan.

05:00.675 --> 05:04.009
If you want a hand with anything,
just give me a shout, Mr Russell.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.511
I will, thanks.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.175
Mr Russell?

06:00.026 --> 06:01.312
Daddy!

06:03.697 --> 06:06.064
Catch!

06:10.495 --> 06:11.531
Mr Russell, I...

06:23.758 --> 06:27.126
You know that this piece is going
to Seattle too, Estancia?

06:27.178 --> 06:28.544
Yes, sir.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.931
Good.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.106
<i>At first, right after it happened,
I was in shock.</i>

06:48.158 --> 06:51.492
I just functioned automatically.
I didn't feel anything.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.946
And one day, it hit me...

06:56.499 --> 06:58.707
Joanna and Kathy are gone.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.211
I just kept walking around the apartment
saying it over and over,

07:02.255 --> 07:03.496
"They're gone, they're gone."

07:03.548 --> 07:05.005
I guess I was about half crazy.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.259
But that's over four months ago and...

07:08.303 --> 07:11.341
what I've got to do now is start
making demands of myself.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.176
Well, your first class is next Monday.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.841
I'll set up a meeting for you tomorrow
with some of the faculty.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.180
You'll remember a lot of them.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.719
11.00 OK for you?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.310
That's fine, Robert, thanks.
Thanks for everything you've done.

07:21.358 --> 07:25.193
Come on. Everyone's very excited
about you being here.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.820
A well-known alumnus and distinguished
composer like yourself.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.777
Says who?

07:30.825 --> 07:34.159
Distinguished or not, we're glad you came.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.117
- Give it to me! Come on! Give it to me!
- No!

07:37.165 --> 07:39.248
OK, kids, keep it down.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.750
Go into the kitchen,
get yourself some cookies.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.880
By the way, how long are you planning
to stay in that hotel?

07:46.925 --> 07:48.791
There's plenty of room for you here,
you know.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.879
No, thanks, Eva.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.512
I think I'm going to find a house to rent.
I've got some things coming out.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.515
What I need is a place I can lock myself
in and pound away at the piano all night.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.549
A place I can work.

07:57.602 --> 08:01.266
I have a friend who works for
the Historical Preservation Society.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.352
They have some old houses
that I'm sure they rent.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.108
We'll see what we can come up with
for you.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.563
Good.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.174
- Mr Russell?
- Yes.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.925
Hello, I'm Claire Norman.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.131
Why don't you hop in and we'll drive up?

08:34.179 --> 08:35.636
Fine.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.007
When was the house last occupied?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.673
Let's see. About 12 years ago.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.514
It's been with the Historical Society
for the past 12 years.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.272
There we go.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.649
Wow!

09:38.036 --> 09:41.950
There were plans at one time to turn it
into some kind of a museum.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.662
But I don't know.
I guess a house was meant to be lived in.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.415
Why hasn't it been lived in?

09:49.464 --> 09:52.628
Well, I've only been with the Society
for a year now.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.589
The impression I get is that they haven't
tried very hard with this place.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.255
Of course, it does need a lot of work.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.673
Yeah.

10:00.725 --> 10:05.470
There's some pieces here
that are just stored.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.229
You'd have your pick of them.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.935
You know, whatever you'd like.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.602
Kitchen's in here.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.988
What does it take to maintain
a house of this size?

10:16.032 --> 10:20.902
Oh, we have a man who looks after
all these places. Mr Tuttle.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.030
And...

10:25.875 --> 10:27.457
This is the music room.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.879
This is really why I thought of you
and this house.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.167
The piano was left here
when the Society took over.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.336
Just too much trouble to move, really.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.345
It must be in very bad shape.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.926
What are the terms?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.919
Sorry to disturb your composing.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.207
That's all right, Mr Tuttle.
This has already been composed.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.093
There's a man at the front, wants to
deliver a water storage tank.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.173
Says you called him.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.383
Oh, OK.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.032
Have you managed to do any writing?

12:28.081 --> 12:31.245
Yes. I'm still working on the second
movement. Same old problem.

12:31.292 --> 12:35.252
Well, maybe the lectures will help,
get some new ideas going.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.223
It's my understanding...

12:57.735 --> 12:59.397
...that there are...

13:00.488 --> 13:02.855
...23 students registered...

13:05.201 --> 13:08.660
...for this series of lectures
on advanced musical form.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.869
Now, we all know that
it's not raining outside.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.458
And unless there's a fire

13:14.502 --> 13:17.540
in some other part of the building
we don't know about,

13:17.588 --> 13:21.207
there's an awful lot of people
here with nothing better to do.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.634
However...

13:24.679 --> 13:28.298
we'll know more after the second lecture.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.221
I'm sure there are many of you...

13:32.270 --> 13:34.182
who may recognise this.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.971
Well, it sounds a little bit better with
an orchestra than it does with a piano.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.474
No, you made it sound fine.
That was a great class.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.135
John's secret is that he's a natural ham.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.770
Don't go too far. Excuse me.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.771
If you can't find your way back...

14:18.816 --> 14:20.227
I'll send out a search party.

14:29.744 --> 14:30.985
Hi!

14:31.037 --> 14:33.074
I'd like you to meet my mother.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.988
- How do you do, Mrs Norman?
- How do you do?

14:35.041 --> 14:38.125
This is John Russell.
You remember the Chessman house?

14:38.169 --> 14:43.039
Oh! Oh, yes.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr Russell.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.923
How are you liking the place?

14:44.967 --> 14:45.957
Fine.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.423
It's so large.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.461
Yes.

14:49.514 --> 14:53.303
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

14:53.351 --> 14:56.765
I'd like to introduce
Senator Joseph Carmichael...

14:56.813 --> 15:00.306
My God!
He's going to make another speech.

15:00.358 --> 15:04.352
What you're hearing is a lifelong
Republican commenting on a Democrat.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.316
I see!

15:06.364 --> 15:09.027
You know how I hate making speeches.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.118
But sometimes,
on a very special occasion...

15:13.162 --> 15:16.576
like raising money for our magnificent
symphony orchestra...

15:16.624 --> 15:19.241
And weren't they fantastic tonight?

15:22.046 --> 15:23.582
Damn right.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.418
I was just going to get a drink.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.923
I think I'll join you.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.425
I'll be right back, Mother.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.004
Thank you.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.928
Thank you.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.594
Actually, he's on our board
of directors

15:38.646 --> 15:40.808
at the Historical Preservation
Society.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.349
In fact, he's become our number one
philanthropist.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.185
So, you're getting settled in then?

15:46.237 --> 15:47.944
- Oh, yes.
- Good.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.448
There's some things at the Society office
that belong to your house.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.984
I'll see if I can dig them up for you.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.278
I'm glad you took the house.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.079
Mr Tuttle?

18:54.675 --> 18:56.382
Mr Tuttle?

18:56.427 --> 18:58.840
Yes, Mr Russell?

19:00.222 --> 19:02.088
You frightened me.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.224
Is anyone else here?

19:04.268 --> 19:07.887
- Mrs Rissean cleaning today?
- No, sir, just me.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.520
Thank you.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.864
That's lovely.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.157
The music.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.417
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.454
Has the quality of a lullaby.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.417
Yes, it is in a sort.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.379
Well, here we are, as promised.

21:01.427 --> 21:05.762
These are some assorted prints that
used to hang in the house somewhere.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.842
Ah!

21:06.891 --> 21:08.757
And this...

21:08.809 --> 21:12.553
is an old restored photograph taken
at the front of the house.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.892
- Isn't that remarkable?
- Beautiful.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.861
I tried to call you first, but Information
isn't giving your number out yet.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.319
That's a beautiful old piece.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.949
Did you refinish it?

21:26.994 --> 21:28.701
I didn't, no.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.032
Oh!

21:31.457 --> 21:34.950
Um, that was Kathy's, my daughter's.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.969
Well, I guess I'd better be off.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.925
I hope you like the prints.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.464
Thank you.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.809
You going riding?

21:53.854 --> 21:55.390
Yes.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.896
Do you ride?

22:39.817 --> 22:42.059
John...

22:42.111 --> 22:44.398
What's the matter?

22:46.073 --> 22:48.565
I was just thinking about
my daughter, Kathy.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.782
How much she loved horses.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.040
<i>Mummy!</i>

22:58.085 --> 23:00.168
Mummy!

23:34.580 --> 23:36.572
An air lock somewhere.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.911
It was too loud, too rhythmic.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.546
Well, it's starting, at least.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.255
Why would it happen two mornings in a row?

23:49.303 --> 23:51.966
Precisely at 6.00?

23:52.014 --> 23:55.303
Why does it go on for about half a minute
and then stop dead?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.467
It doesn't make sense.

23:58.228 --> 24:01.471
A furnace is like anything else,
Mr Russell.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.480
It's got habits.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.983
It's an old house.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.190
It makes noises.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.760
Well, very good.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.718
We're still not together on the off beats.

24:35.766 --> 24:40.511
And, darling, you're retarding a little
too much on the last four bars.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.100
Otherwise, it was splendid.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.059
- Good night.
- Good night. See you tomorrow.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.802
What I'm driving at is...

28:04.850 --> 28:08.059
Has anything like this happened
in the house before?

28:08.103 --> 28:11.938
If so, to whom, when,
and what did they do about it?

28:13.025 --> 28:15.984
Since I've been with the Society,
the house has been empty.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.567
John, you're working very hard.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.823
You've been through a terrible
emotional strain.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.699
- Isn't it possible...?
- Hallucinating.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.610
- Is that what you're going to say?
- Excuse me.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.994
Minnie?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.452
Claire, there's a call for you -
your mother.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.207
- Should I tell her you're busy?
- I'll be right there.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.335
Excuse me, John, just for a minute.

28:42.512 --> 28:46.005
You know there's some question about
your lease, Mr Russell.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.265
What do you mean?

28:48.352 --> 28:50.014
That house shouldn't have been rented.

28:50.062 --> 28:54.272
Miss Norman rushed those papers
through our attorney's office.

28:54.316 --> 28:57.434
She did not use proper channels.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.728
Why should anyone object?

29:01.114 --> 29:03.731
That house is not fit to live in.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.531
No one's been able to live in it.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.244
It doesn't want people.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.417
Then there has been trouble
in the house before?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.877
Claire, listen, it's note for note.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.414
Same tempo, even the same key.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.332
What do you think?

37:00.385 --> 37:02.092
I don't know.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.129
It's a startling coincidence.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.225
But that melody must have been
very popular at one time

37:09.269 --> 37:11.226
or it wouldn't be on the music box.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.979
I agree, but I swear I'd never heard it...

37:14.023 --> 37:16.936
before I played it and recorded it
that day you came over.

37:16.985 --> 37:19.068
No, there's something...

37:19.112 --> 37:20.728
Something.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.193
It's happened before here.
I'm not the first.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.405
I went over the files very carefully,

37:26.453 --> 37:28.786
all the way back to 1920.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.538
Nothing out of the ordinary.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.199
Miss Huxley.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.743
Minnie's a highly eccentric old woman

37:35.795 --> 37:37.787
- but she'd never...
- No.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.707
She said the house didn't want people.
She's mistaken.

37:40.759 --> 37:44.844
Whatever it is is trying
desperately to communicate.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.596
The bangings, the water taps,
the broken window panes.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.303
All the glass fell outward.
It had to be done from the inside.

37:50.351 --> 37:54.971
Everything that's happened has been
designed to get me into that attic room.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.061
I want to see it.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.956
Look at that book on the desk there.

38:26.513 --> 38:31.599
"CSB. January 4, 1909."

38:33.812 --> 38:35.394
It's a little child's writing.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.189
1909. Who could've lived here then?

38:43.238 --> 38:45.776
That's where I found the music box,
on the mantel.

38:51.788 --> 38:53.324
Look at this wheelchair.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.915
Oh, my God!

38:59.087 --> 39:00.623
It's so small.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.000
What was this room?

39:41.671 --> 39:45.460
<i>Former residents William Sarachino
and family. Architect.</i>

39:45.508 --> 39:49.297
<i>Bought the place in 1965. Sold it in 1967.</i>

39:49.345 --> 39:53.555
Purchased for the Society for Historical
Preservation November 1967,

39:53.600 --> 39:56.684
through a generous grant from the
Carmichael Foundation. That's the senator?

39:56.728 --> 39:59.141
- Yeah.
- Great philanthropist.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.350
Now, where is the rest of this file?

40:01.399 --> 40:03.265
Previous occupants...

40:04.360 --> 40:06.317
No previous occupants listed.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.854
There's nothing here before 1920.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.368
Minnie, we're looking for the Chessman
house file, pre-1920.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.528
Do you know where it is?

40:15.580 --> 40:17.412
What is it you want to know?

40:17.457 --> 40:20.165
We're trying to find out who lived in
the house in 1909.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.338
A man named Barnard. A doctor.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.839
Did he have any children, do you know?

40:27.884 --> 40:31.048
I believe a son and a daughter.

40:31.095 --> 40:34.213
There was some kind of family tragedy,
I think.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.349
He sold the house in 1909.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.931
1909? I'll set it up for you.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.720
Fine, OK.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.808
It's all ready to go.
The scanner's on the right.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.146
Thank you so much.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.693
Let's have a look here.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.243
February 9th. These are want ads.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.371
Financial page...

40:59.415 --> 41:01.907
Real estate. More want ads.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.505
Wait, wait, wait.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.347
"Cora Barnard, seven-year-old daughter of
Dr Walter Barnard,

41:16.391 --> 41:19.350
"prominent Seattle physician, was struck
and seriously injured

41:19.394 --> 41:21.852
"when she ran in front of
a passing coal cart

41:21.896 --> 41:24.513
"outside her Chessman Park
home yesterday.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.602
"She was hastened to
St Margaret's Hospital,

41:26.651 --> 41:28.392
"where her condition remains grave."

41:28.444 --> 41:30.527
So forth and so on.

41:30.571 --> 41:33.985
Cora Barnard. CSB.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.032
There!

41:44.961 --> 41:48.796
"Cora Stuart Barnard, daughter of...

41:48.840 --> 41:52.379
"succumbed in St Margaret's Hospital

41:52.427 --> 41:55.135
"to injuries sustained in

41:55.179 --> 41:57.045
"She is mourned by her parents.

41:57.098 --> 42:02.264
"Miss Barnard will be interred in the
family plot in Brookfield Cemetery."

42:04.814 --> 42:07.022
There's the doctor.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.523
And his wife.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.734
There's the brother, Lloyd.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.203
This little girl, Cora...

42:23.416 --> 42:24.998
...was killed in the street.

42:27.003 --> 42:29.336
It was an accident
almost the same as Kathy.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.592
What is it in that house, Claire?

42:41.059 --> 42:43.096
What is it doing?
Why is it trying to reach me?

42:43.144 --> 42:45.511
- John...
- Is it because of my daughter?

42:48.232 --> 42:50.895
I can't go through all this again.

42:50.943 --> 42:54.857
John, you must get out of that house.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.755
<i>I believe everything you're saying,
Mr Russell.</i>

45:21.802 --> 45:25.386
<i>The noises, the lights, the teleportation
of objects, all very familiar.</i>

45:25.431 --> 45:26.421
<i>Fascinating stuff.</i>

45:26.474 --> 45:28.511
- But the point is...
- Yeah?

45:28.559 --> 45:31.017
What do I do now? I mean...

45:31.062 --> 45:34.226
Ah! I tell you, off the record.

45:34.273 --> 45:40.565
We have coming here many mediums
and spiritualists and so.

45:40.613 --> 45:42.229
And we test them.

45:42.281 --> 45:46.446
Now, 99% are the frauds.

45:46.494 --> 45:49.532
But the 1%...

45:50.998 --> 45:52.910
...astonishing!

45:52.959 --> 45:56.077
- Hm! A medium.
- Mm-hm.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.645
Hello.

46:22.697 --> 46:24.654
- Mr Russell?
- Yes.

46:24.699 --> 46:25.985
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

46:26.033 --> 46:27.990
- My wife, Leah.
- Come in, please.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.867
- Thank you.
- It's just to your left.

46:32.081 --> 46:34.869
Could we have these lights off, please?

46:43.217 --> 46:44.708
Thank you.

46:54.186 --> 46:56.428
I thought I'd record what happens.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.437
- Is that all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.

47:00.901 --> 47:03.689
That's fine.
Mr Russell, would you sit there, please?

47:03.738 --> 47:05.695
- Yes, of course.
- And I'll sit here.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.072
Thank you.

47:58.250 --> 48:01.414
You've suffered a cruel loss,
John Russell.

48:01.462 --> 48:04.330
You've lost a wife and child.

48:06.550 --> 48:11.045
The presence in this house is reaching
out to you through that loss.

48:15.017 --> 48:18.886
The presence is very strong here.

48:26.445 --> 48:28.812
It is a child's presence.

48:28.864 --> 48:31.277
A child who is not at peace.

48:32.368 --> 48:35.111
Who cannot rest.

48:39.333 --> 48:43.293
The presence... is with us.

48:45.798 --> 48:48.415
We sense that you are with us.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.010
Will you talk to us?

48:55.307 --> 48:57.765
Will you communicate with us?

48:59.353 --> 49:02.141
Will you come through to us?

49:06.402 --> 49:10.066
Will you speak to us?

49:16.078 --> 49:18.570
We are here to help you.

49:23.377 --> 49:24.834
What is your name?

49:27.965 --> 49:29.797
Will you speak to us?

49:32.261 --> 49:33.797
Yes.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.719
What is your name?

49:40.227 --> 49:42.765
Are you the child Cora?

49:44.899 --> 49:48.358
Are you the child killed by the coal cart?

49:50.613 --> 49:52.149
No.

49:54.909 --> 49:56.571
What is your name?

50:05.878 --> 50:07.039
Joseph.

50:08.714 --> 50:11.297
Did you die in this house, Joseph?

50:13.802 --> 50:15.543
How did you die?

50:18.891 --> 50:23.932
Is there someone here you wish
to communicate with?

50:30.569 --> 50:32.060
John.

50:33.906 --> 50:36.899
Help. Help. Help.

50:38.619 --> 50:41.578
Help. John. Help.

50:41.622 --> 50:45.161
Help.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.420
Mr Russell, will you sit over here now,
please?

51:07.147 --> 51:09.480
Will you speak to John?

51:13.779 --> 51:17.443
Will you tell us why you are not at rest?

51:19.994 --> 51:22.702
Speak to John.

51:25.666 --> 51:28.079
John is with us.

51:33.591 --> 51:36.299
What do you want of John?

51:39.555 --> 51:42.172
Why do you feel no peace?

51:51.108 --> 51:54.067
Why do you remain in this house, Joseph?

51:55.821 --> 51:57.813
What is in this house?

52:00.367 --> 52:02.404
Speak to John.

52:04.538 --> 52:06.530
John is with us.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.790
How did you die?

52:11.128 --> 52:13.745
Did you die in this house?

52:16.675 --> 52:19.213
Why do you remain in this house?

52:19.261 --> 52:22.550
Joseph, how did you die?

52:24.808 --> 52:27.642
Joseph, did you die in this house?

53:35.587 --> 53:37.704
<i>We are here to help you.</i>

53:42.720 --> 53:44.256
<i>What is your name?</i>

53:49.601 --> 53:51.593

53:54.106 --> 53:55.222
<i>No.</i>

53:55.274 --> 53:56.481
<i>No.</i>

54:06.034 --> 54:10.199
<i>Are you the child killed by
the coal cart?</i>

54:10.247 --> 54:12.739
<i>No.</i>

54:12.791 --> 54:14.123
<i>No.</i>

54:21.675 --> 54:24.839

55:09.932 --> 55:12.424
<i>Did you die in this house, Joseph?</i>

<i>House.</i>

55:16.271 --> 55:18.308

55:19.900 --> 55:21.857
<i>Can't walk.</i>

55:24.530 --> 55:29.275
<i>Will you tell us why you are not at rest?</i>

55:29.326 --> 55:31.443
<i>My father.</i>

<i>Joseph, did you die in this house?</i>

55:34.039 --> 55:35.496
<i>My room.</i>

55:35.541 --> 55:37.157
<i>How did you die?</i>

55:37.209 --> 55:39.121
<i>How did you die?</i>

55:39.169 --> 55:41.331
How did you die?

55:42.673 --> 55:43.789
How did you die?

55:43.841 --> 55:45.332
<i>Father.</i>

55:45.384 --> 55:47.341
<i>Father.</i>

55:48.637 --> 55:50.594
<i>The well.</i>

55:50.639 --> 55:51.971
<i>Ranch.</i>

55:53.475 --> 55:55.842
<i>Sacred Heart.</i>

55:55.894 --> 55:58.102
<i>My medal.</i>

55:58.146 --> 56:00.138

56:00.190 --> 56:04.104
<i>Father, don't.</i>

56:04.152 --> 56:05.359
<i>Help!</i>

56:49.281 --> 56:51.819
<i>My body.</i>

56:51.867 --> 56:53.904
<i>Ranch.</i>

56:53.952 --> 56:55.864
<i>The well.</i>

56:57.706 --> 57:03.122
<i>My name... Joseph Carmichael.</i>

58:10.821 --> 58:12.653
Claire?

58:12.698 --> 58:14.109
Yeah.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.950
I'm sorry to...

58:17.995 --> 58:21.318
I...

58:21.415 --> 58:22.872
I just...

58:22.916 --> 58:24.248
Can you c...?

58:24.292 --> 58:25.783
I...

58:33.635 --> 58:35.001
<i>House.</i>

58:38.015 --> 58:39.256
<i>My room.</i>

58:40.600 --> 58:42.592
<i>Can't walk.</i>

58:45.981 --> 58:49.520
<i>Will you tell us why you are not at rest?</i>

58:50.610 --> 58:52.317
<i>My father.</i>

58:52.362 --> 58:55.150
<i>Joseph, did you die in this house?</i>

58:55.198 --> 58:56.564
<i>My room.</i>

58:56.616 --> 58:57.982
<i>How did you die?</i>

58:59.411 --> 59:01.368
<i>Father, don't.</i>

59:02.456 --> 59:08.248
<i>My name... Joseph Carmichael.</i>

59:24.561 --> 59:27.178
I'm sorry, I...

59:27.230 --> 59:29.847
I shouldn't have called you.
It's just that I needed someone.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.768
I know, I know.

59:36.782 --> 59:38.648
I wrote some words on a paper.

59:41.161 --> 59:44.404
I wrote "Sacred Heart".

59:49.878 --> 59:52.837
There used to be a county orphanage...

59:52.881 --> 59:54.668
named Sacred Heart.

59:55.759 --> 59:58.092
It was closed down years ago.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:01.424
Orphanage?

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:04.678
Yes.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.226
Their child, Joseph Carmichael.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:16.228
He was murdered in this house
in the attic.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.405
And buried.

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:24.281
- And then an orphan...
- Stop it, John!

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.911
Just for one minute, please!

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:20.549
Miss Huxley's on the phone, Senator.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.553
It's the third time she's called this
morning. She says it's important.

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:25.088
All right, I'll take it.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:38.859
Hello, Minnie. How are you?

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:41.191
I'm fine.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:44.482
They've been going through the files.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:47.902
Let me have that name again.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:50.947
John...

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.500
...Russell.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:58.037
I'm very glad to be of help, as you know.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.257
Goodbye.

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:49.297
This is the senator's campaign bio
of 1960.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:52.217
I got it from the main library,
had them Xerox it for me.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.476
You found something?

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.854
It's some kind of a rough retrospective
that somebody drew up

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.686
when they were thinking about
turning the house into a museum.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:04.525
Richard Carmichael and family occupied
the house 1899 to 1906.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:07.781
Richard was the senator's father.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:11.035
His mother died when he was born in 1900.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:13.071
It's all in there.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:15.456
Look at the part about his illness.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.957
Um...

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:19.119
"Joe Carmichael, their son, at age three

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.083
"was struck down with a form of
atrophic arthritis..."

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:23.794
A little further down.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:27.335
"It was decided to send little Joe to
the famed Nordbach Sanatorium

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.754
"in Basel, Switzerland,
for special therapy.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:33.925
"Accompanied by his father,
he embarked for Europe in October, 1906

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:39.314
"not to set foot on American soil again
until the cessation of World War I."

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:41.314
See how it might have been done?

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:44.151
Richard's son, a sick child,

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:47.108
was murdered by his father
and buried secretly.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.277
Then the substitute, a six-year-old
orphan, was put in his place,

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.036
shipped right overseas right away,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.412
with the father attending.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.244
It all worked for them.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.329
Even the war worked.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:01.164
It kept him in Switzerland till 1918.

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:03.545
He came back here, he was 18 years old.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.207
Who was going to know that he wasn't
the real son?

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.842
If he wasn't crippled any more,
it was because he was cured.

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.128
John...

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.595
Do you think he knows about the murder
and about the replacement?

01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:16.725
I don't know.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.729
How could any father do such a thing?

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.557
Richard's wife was Emily Spencer.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:28.105
She was the daughter of HT Spencer,
who founded the Spencer Carmichael empire.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:32.070
He died in 1905. He was a zillionaire.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.654
His will!

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.865
His will might be very interesting.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:38.201
There must be a copy of it
in the hall of records.

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:40.411
I'm also going to try to find out
if there was a ranch,

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.453
a Spencer or a Carmichael ranch
somewhere.

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:46.589
Yeah, a ranch with a well.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.922
This is the 1908 atlas of Seattle

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:57.432
which is open to the part of the city
where the Carmichael ranch was located.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.514
- Right here.
- What does that little mark there mean?

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:05.274
According to the legend, here, that was
the location of a well on that property.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:06.399
I see.

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:10.905
And in the 1914 atlas which is opened here
to the same area,

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:14.989
there's been one large lot
that's apparently been sold off,

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.572
but the property is very much the same

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:18.487
and the location of the well
is still given.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.781
Right. Exactly.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.701
The 1928 atlas was quite a change.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.165
There's further subdivision
of the property.

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:29.628
The symbol for the well has disappeared
and a house has been built here.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.688
The ranch is listed in the will.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.439
It's part of the inheritance of
little Joseph Carmichael,

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:31.898
all of five years old at the time.

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:33.983
He got just about everything.

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.898
What about the father, Richard?

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.316
Bypassed.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:40.907
Except as his son's guardian,
and therefore trustee of the estate.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:43.368
Well, old man Spencer's daughter
was dead

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.534
and, obviously, he wasn't too fond of
his son-in-law.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.122
Yes, but wait.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.504
Richard doesn't get any money

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:54.588
but he still controls his son,
and his son is worth a fortune.

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:56.252
Unless...

01:06:56.304 --> 01:07:00.924
Unless, for some reason, the boy dies
before attaining the age of 21.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:03.592
In that case, the entire estate
goes to charity.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.519
That would have shut Richard out
completely

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:11.355
and there he was with a son who was weak,
sickly, bedridden, couldn't even walk.

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:16.071
He must have decided not to take
a chance on the boy.

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.949
The money was just too tempting.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.130
What are you going to tell her?

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.390
About the well under the house
and the body.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:45.391
And the medal with the name on it?

01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:47.098
No. Nothing about Carmichael.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.896
She'll think you're crazy.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.557
You'll tell her I'm not.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.225
Hmm!

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:03.111
Good evening, Mrs Grey. I'm John Russell.
This is Miss Norman.

01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:15.749
Mr Russell, I wouldn't have listened
to your story for two minutes.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.465
I wouldn't have let you in here, but for
something you said on the phone earlier.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:25.349
You said that this sÃ©ance affair of yours
happened three nights ago.

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:26.759
- Right?
- That's right.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.014
Well, three nights ago, on Monday night...

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:36.645
...Linda, my daughter, woke up screaming

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:39.188
just after midnight.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.277
She'd had a nightmare.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:44.785
When I went in to her, she was hysterical,
she was sobbing.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:47.287
I'd never seen her like that before.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.698
Oh, I mean, she'd had nightmares before,
but not...

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:56.163
She said she'd seen a boy.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:59.834
Very small, very thin.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.877
Almost gnome-like.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:06.264
And he was trying to come up
through the floor.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:09.389
And he kept staring at her.

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.764
Here, in the middle.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:19.189
She hasn't been in this room since,
won't come near it. She sleeps with me.

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.604
What we want is...

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.901
What you want, Mr Russell,
is to tear this room apart.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:31.240
Well, I have your phone number,
Mr Russell. I'll have to think about it.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:27.397
Linda!

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.700
What the hell's going on? Linda!

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.465
They're still digging.

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:55.931
But they found the well.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.514
OK.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:04.776
Did you find anything?

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:08.940
No, nothing yet.
This is Tony, Mrs Grey's son. Miss Norman.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:11.529
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.431
Give me that flashlight, will you?

01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:43.473
Sure.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.563
I think I found something.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:48.562
What is it?

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.080
It's a hand.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.415
What?

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.248
It's a hand.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.505
I'll call the police.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.218
There's nothing more?

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:22.847
Doesn't look like it.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.141
You think there might be
something else down there?

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:26.478
No.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:30.942
Assistant coroner said those bones had
been down there maybe 50 years.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.107
Do you have some idea who that child was?

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:35.151
No, not really.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:37.034
What's "not really" mean?

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:39.863
No.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.708
I'm going to want statements
from everybody.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.746
Mrs Grey, do you have some other place
you could stay for tonight?

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:48.914
- Yes, it's all been arranged.
- Good.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:02.261
I think you should have told them.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:06.273
It's gotta be there. Without that medal,
there's no evidence, there's nothing.

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:07.899
You have the tape.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:12.109
Tapes can be altered. They know that.
Did you see the expression on his face?

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.864
It was obvious you were holding
something back.

01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:16.650
I'll say.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:20.491
Look, it's very late. Let me go get some
rest, and I'll talk to you in the morning.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.576
- Fine. Drive carefully.
- You too.

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.173
What's the matter?

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:33.351
"St Paul's Church, September 8, 1900.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:35.607
"Joseph Patrick Carmichael."

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.643
It was there.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.527
It was there.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.237
You have to show it to the police.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:48.324
It's the only piece of solid evidence
we've got.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:50.534
They didn't see me dig it up,
they couldn't find it.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.199
Why should they believe it was there?

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.368
You can't just ignore them.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:59.381
The police aren't going to trouble
themselves with a 70-year-old case.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:02.293
- Still, it's an unsolved murder.
- Nah.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:05.712
Whatever's to be done has to be
done by me.

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.676
I've got to get to Carmichael.

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:11.264
- He won't see you now.
- He'll see me.

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:18.770
Senator!

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.527
- Hey, hold it right there! Hold up.
- Mr Carmichael!

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.780
- Senator...
- Wait a minute, now.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.281
Get the hell out of my way.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:28.945
Senator, I'm John Russell.
I'm living in your house.

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:30.578
Senator, look.

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:32.990
I want to show him that.
I want to talk to him.

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:35.750
Let me go! Senator!

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:38.662
Look at this medal. It's a baptism medal.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.421
It's got your name on it.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:41.798
- You got him?
- We got him.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:43.174
It was buried with a body.

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:47.387
A little boy.

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.923
Senator! The police know about it.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:01.022
Who was that? Some kind of crackpot?

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:03.694
I've no idea.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:06.106
Never mind. Come on.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.529
Dale...

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:19.203
I want you to radio back to police
headquarters, Captain DeWitt.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:22.794
Ask him to call me in Spokane
at this number.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.548
Yes, sir.

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:15.266
You goddamn son of a bitch.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.056
What is it you want?

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.897
What do you want from me?

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:25.564
I've done everything I can do!

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:30.531
There's nothing more to do.

01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:13.195
Mr Russell?

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:14.859
Yes?

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:16.778
My name is DeWitt, Captain DeWitt.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.071
Oh, yes.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:19.785
I'd like to talk to you if I may.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.574
All right. Come in.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:30.254
Quite a house.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:31.793
Yes.

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:37.678
You're a musician, a composer,
is that right, Mr Russell?

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:38.967
Yes.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:42.103
You're teaching a course at the faculty
of music out of the university?

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.638
That's right.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.942
Is this where you held your sÃ©ance?

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:51.570
What was it you wanted to talk
to me about?

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:58.029
You were out at Boeing Airfield
this morning, Mr Russell.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:03.451
They tell me you caused quite a scene,
screaming, yelling, acting like a lunatic.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:08.497
Sergeant Durban tells me you were
up to some strange things last night too.

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:11.792
Seems you dug up some bones
under a lady's house

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:16.134
that some ghostly voice told you
were there, is that correct?

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:21.097
Only Sergeant Durban said you told him
you had no idea who those bones were,

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:22.761
no idea at all.

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:24.645
Now, it seems...

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.683
It seems a little odd, then,
don't you think,

01:22:27.734 --> 01:22:30.477
that you'd go charging across
that airfield this morning

01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:33.067
making crazy accusations against
Senator Carmichael?

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.196
I made no accusations.

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:37.450
Senator Carmichael, who has served
this state for 36 years...

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:39.781
- I didn't accuse him of any...
- and is not about to give in

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:41.571
to any dirty little blackmail scheme.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:42.955
- Blackmail?
- You heard me.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.413
What are you talking about?

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:53.250
I understand you lost your wife
and daughter a little while ago.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:55.043
Maybe it shook you up.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:56.631
Maybe too much.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.387
Maybe you need help.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:01.925
I'd like you to leave now.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.684
We can see that you get it.

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:06.307
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:07.346
Out, now.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:08.935
Listen to me, Russell.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:15.647
You've got something of the senator's.
He wants it back.

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:19.363
It's a little gold medal,
a family heirloom. He lost it.

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:22.320
He thinks you've got it.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:26.081
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:35.542
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,
but I am so damn mad.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:37.551
This morn...

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:40.464
This is Captain DeWitt.
He's with the police.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.803
You're... Miss Norman?

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:45.055
Yes.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.898
I take it now, or I come back in an hour
with a warrant and a crew

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.479
and we tear this place apart.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:56.238
Tear this place apart?
What's going on here?

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.772
I'll be here.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.242
Suit yourself.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.248
Well, what was that all about?

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:10.160
Senator Carmichael thinks
he's being blackmailed.

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:16.712
They've cancelled your lease.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.299
They've forced me to resign
from the society.

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:24.057
No explanation, no reason, nothing,
just "get out".

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:26.684
I have an appointment with the head
of the board of directors.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:29.141
I'll see what I can find out.

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:31.226
I'll call you and let you know.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:00.945
Yes?

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:03.151
Yes, Claire?

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.068
I was driving by, and I recognised
the car.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.610
I don't know how it happened.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.952
I don't know how it could have happened.
There are no other cars. There's nothing.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.787
And it's upside down in the middle
of the road.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.873
It's that man, that policeman who was
just at your house.

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:18.663
DeWitt. He's dead.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.628
Carmichael. Any messages?

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.757
Oh, yes. Captain DeWitt. What'd he say?

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:12.178
What?

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:15.557
Yeah.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.271
Oh, my God!

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:24.608
What?

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.443
Who?

01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:29.279
Russell.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:34.325
All right.

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.667
Let me have that number.

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:56.094
John Russell.

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:58.103
The senator's expecting you.

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:22.454
- Still busy?
- Yes.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.010
Where are you going?

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:36.472
- I'll be back in a little while, Mum.
- Claire!

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:51.240
All right. Just what the hell do you want?

01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:53.071
You must have some idea.

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.657
Otherwise I wouldn't have got
past the door.

01:28:55.705 --> 01:28:57.992
Well, I'm a busy man. Make it fast.

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:04.545
The house on Chessman Park.

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:08.045
Your family lived there until 1906.

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:14.305
It's had a history of...
strange happenings.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:18.434
There's something in that house,
a manifestation.

01:29:20.313 --> 01:29:22.771
This afternoon, Captain DeWitt came
to see me,

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:24.478
presumably on your behalf...

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:30.188
...so you must have known what's happened,
at least as much as DeWitt could tell you.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.532
The disturbances, the sÃ©ance,
the bones found in the well.

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.790
I tried to talk to you at the airport.

01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:43.872
I showed you this.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.249
DeWitt said you'd lost it.

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:55.341
I found it in the grave...

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:58.015
...where the child is buried.

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:06.103
There's no logical explanation for
what I'm going to say to you now.

01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:09.727
The boy was badly crippled.

01:30:11.197 --> 01:30:15.316
I believe he was killed
in an attic room of that house.

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.612
I...

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:23.328
I saw what happened.

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:29.414
And I believe it was Richard Carmichael,
your father...

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:33.801
...who murdered the boy,
his natural son.

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:35.677
Joseph Carmichael.

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:41.680
Then there was a substitution
from the Sacred Heart Orphanage.

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:44.391
The boy was taken to Europe,

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:49.150
cured miraculously
and returned to inherit an empire.

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:53.104
That changeling was you.

01:31:06.962 --> 01:31:10.046
So... that's your story.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.714
Whatever you want to call it.

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:18.466
How much?

01:31:18.515 --> 01:31:20.757
My God!

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:24.428
All right, how much do you want for
this farce that you've concocted?

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.391
This isn't blackmail.

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:29.147
I've been dealing with vermin
like you for years.

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:34.153
You wait your chance, then you come
in with a story so patently incredible...

01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:35.563
Truth terrifies you, doesn't it?

01:31:35.615 --> 01:31:37.277
It's the truth.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.237
- It won't be buried.
- Get out.

01:31:39.285 --> 01:31:41.197
None of this belongs to you.

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:43.784
Get out of here with your filthy lies.

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.323
I should have gone to that dead child.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.662
You suspected something was wrong
all your life.

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:49.077
You're not Joseph Carmichael.

01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:53.339
You're the beneficiary of the cruellest
kind of murder. Murder for profit.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:55.124
No!

01:31:56.761 --> 01:31:59.128
My father was not a murderer.

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:03.261
Nobody in this world can say that.

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:07.762
My father was a great man.

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:10.931
He was a loving man.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:16.688
And for you to come in here
and accuse him of...

01:32:20.285 --> 01:32:22.572
How can you?

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:27.364
Damn you!

01:32:30.503 --> 01:32:34.372
I will not allow you to slander
his good name.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:47.177
These documents are on file with the city.

01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:51.354
This is a tape of the sÃ©ance.

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:54.812
There's no copy.

01:32:56.696 --> 01:32:58.983
Take it. I've done what I had to do.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.363
I'm sorry.

01:33:09.084 --> 01:33:10.495
Russell...

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:15.872
If I find that you've breathed
one word of this...

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:19.759
one word to anyone...

01:33:19.803 --> 01:33:22.546
you'll wish you'd never come
into this world.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.111
What was all that shouting about?

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:49.367
Nothing.

01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:52.453
Get out.

01:33:52.502 --> 01:33:53.993
Leave me alone.

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:40.881
John?

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.171
I tried to call...

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:52.426
John?

01:34:54.647 --> 01:34:56.434
<i>This isn't like me.</i>

01:34:56.482 --> 01:34:59.316
John, where are you?

01:35:14.792 --> 01:35:16.499
John, what are you doing?

01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:19.953
John?

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:00.661
John?

01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:03.372
Please.

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:05.040
I don't want to come up there.

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:06.584
<i>Claire?</i>

01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:08.965
John?

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:23.813
John?

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:02.814
I called you. I called you.

01:37:02.859 --> 01:37:04.600
I thought you were here.

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.244
I thought you were here.

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:17.655
I kept calling you and calling you.

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:21.075
It's OK. Just calm down.

01:37:21.127 --> 01:37:22.663
I want you to wait in the car for me.

01:37:22.712 --> 01:37:24.829
No, you're not going back in there!

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.668
No, please, please, don't!

01:37:26.716 --> 01:37:29.083
Claire, Claire. Get ahold of yourself.

01:37:29.135 --> 01:37:31.502
Go on. I'll be right back. Don't worry.

01:37:35.725 --> 01:37:37.808
Joseph, no!

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:16.567
<i>Father!</i>

01:39:21.372 --> 01:39:23.614
<i>My medal!</i>

01:39:23.666 --> 01:39:26.249
<i>My medal!</i>

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:30.462
<i>Father, Father!</i>

01:39:31.716 --> 01:39:34.550
<i>Father! My medal!</i>

01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:38.213
<i>My medal!</i>

01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:39.638
<i>My medal!</i>

01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:32.184
John!

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:45.237
John!

01:41:04.267 --> 01:41:06.850
<i>Father! Father!</i>

01:41:11.649 --> 01:41:13.436
<i>Father...</i>

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:14.895
<i>Father, don't!</i>

01:41:16.654 --> 01:41:18.395
<i>Help!</i>
