00:02.240 --> 00:05.599
TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:05.639 --> 00:07.599
DAMIEN: Uh, Webster?

00:07.639 --> 00:08.599
-You're in the company.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.839
You, you're Damien Lang!

00:09.880 --> 00:10.519
-Yeah, Damo.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.240
Hi.

00:11.279 --> 00:11.839
[laughs]

00:11.880 --> 00:15.039
-Now you're sure?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.640
-Why are you going
out with Ethan?

00:16.679 --> 00:19.320
-Because he's perfect.

00:19.359 --> 00:20.640
-OK.

00:20.679 --> 00:23.320
-You can flirt with as many--

00:27.559 --> 00:28.640
Aah!

00:28.679 --> 00:30.320
CHRISTIAN: Tara!

00:30.359 --> 00:33.840
-[crying]

00:33.880 --> 00:44.399
[theme song] Whoa-oh whoa.

00:44.439 --> 00:47.240
Whoa-oh whoa.

00:47.280 --> 00:53.560
Take a breath, close your eyes.

00:53.600 --> 01:01.560
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.599
This is my chance,
this is my chance.

01:05.640 --> 01:09.599
My chance to feel alive.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.560
-Whoa-oh whoa.

01:12.599 --> 01:15.519
Whoa-oh whoa.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.400
TARA (VOICEOVER): Growing
up, my least favorite fairy

01:22.439 --> 01:23.799
tale was "The Little Mermaid."

01:23.840 --> 01:25.159
FEMALE DOCTOR:
Dislocated patella.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.200
And I'm pretty sure
the femur's fractured.

01:26.239 --> 01:27.599
MALE DOCTOR: How
long was it out?

01:27.640 --> 01:28.840
FEMALE DOCTOR: Only a few
minutes, but she's a dancer.

01:28.879 --> 01:30.159
TARA (VOICEOVER):
At 15, she decided

01:30.200 --> 01:31.560
she was tired of being magical.

01:31.599 --> 01:35.480
She wanted a human soul
to feel human love.

01:35.519 --> 01:38.760
So she traded in her
tail for some guy.

01:38.799 --> 01:42.159
And from then on,
every step she took

01:42.200 --> 01:43.640
felt like she was
standing on swords.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.159
I never rated that story.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.439
If it was a proper
fairy tale, she

01:48.480 --> 01:50.840
should have been
able to have both.

01:50.879 --> 01:52.280
-Remember, this
is the first time

01:52.319 --> 01:53.640
the prince has seen Cinderella.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.599
They can't take their
eyes off each other.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.519
Good, Abigail.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.439
Release the arms.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.199
Yes, there's the connection.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.080
Finally you're showing
me some artistry.

02:26.759 --> 02:29.319
[phone ringing]

02:29.360 --> 02:31.759
-Um Max, I'll have
to call you back.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.319
MISS RAINE: Tara,
what is it now?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.479
A crisis over napkin colors?

02:36.520 --> 02:37.960
-Sorry.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.159
-When you requested permission
to stage this social event,

02:41.199 --> 02:43.240
I was assured it
wouldn't be disruptive.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.199
-I know, Miss Raine.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.360
I promise it won't happen--

02:45.400 --> 02:45.759
[phone rings]

02:45.800 --> 02:47.840
-Again.

02:47.879 --> 02:49.599
-Tara can't talk right now.

02:53.439 --> 02:56.280
-[giggles] Shh!

02:56.319 --> 02:59.080
You are not telling me
the snow machine's booked!

02:59.120 --> 03:01.400
But we had an agreement.

03:01.439 --> 03:01.840
A bubble machine?

03:01.879 --> 03:03.319
-Oh!

03:03.360 --> 03:05.599
So lame it's not even lame
enough not to be lame.

03:05.639 --> 03:06.719
-That's no on the bubbles.

03:06.759 --> 03:08.159
Thanks, Max.

03:08.199 --> 03:10.439
-You know, I meant the
formal in its entirety.

03:10.479 --> 03:12.639
One small benefit
of this place is

03:12.680 --> 03:15.240
that we get to miss out on the
cheesy high school rituals.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.360
-But it's the defining
moment of our teenage lives.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.479
-Please Tara, just admit
that the only reason

03:20.520 --> 03:24.599
you want a formal is because
you have a boyfriend.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.800
-Mate, we just gotta remember
that it doesn't matter

03:26.840 --> 03:28.800
who it is, so long as
it's one of us, yeah?

03:28.840 --> 03:31.199
-You know it.

03:31.240 --> 03:31.840
See ya.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.280
-Bye.

03:33.319 --> 03:35.039
Hi.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.280
-So you've heard
about Damien Lang?

03:37.319 --> 03:39.039
His knee still hasn't improved.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.319
There's a lot of
ligament damage.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.159
-You know it's bad karma
to look excited by that!

03:43.199 --> 03:44.639
Tara has the exact same injury!

03:44.680 --> 03:48.240
-Just listen for a second, OK?

03:48.280 --> 03:52.680
The company are contemplating a
shuffle up, taking a third year

03:52.719 --> 03:53.800
early.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.400
-Wow, so you and
Tim are in the mix!

03:55.439 --> 03:57.639
-Can't say anything,
'cause they have

03:57.680 --> 03:59.039
to be seen interviewing people.

03:59.080 --> 04:04.199
But I got the heads up
they want it to be me.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.680
Kat, if Damo doesn't make
it back, I'm in the company.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.560
DR. WICKS: Missing it?

04:18.600 --> 04:19.519
-Oh!

04:19.560 --> 04:21.480
Dr. Wicks, I didn't see you.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.399
-I don't want you to
be nervous about today.

04:23.439 --> 04:26.160
We'll be able to tell mo
once the plaster's off.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.319
-I'm not nervous.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.120
-Good.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.560
If it hasn't healed properly,
there are other options.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.600
-OK.

04:34.639 --> 04:35.279
-OK.

04:35.319 --> 04:37.439
See you.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.480
-Hey, everything OK?

04:39.519 --> 04:41.519
--[sighs] Yeah, just
boring doctor stuff.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.319
-Well, do you want to
bore me with the details?

04:44.360 --> 04:45.680
-Details, hey?

04:45.720 --> 04:49.759
How are you with finger food,
fairy lights, streamers?

04:49.800 --> 04:50.759
Oh!

04:50.800 --> 04:53.319
[laughs]

04:53.360 --> 04:56.279
[music playing]

05:45.839 --> 05:47.439
-Oh, I think--

05:47.480 --> 05:48.759
-My watch. [inaudible].

05:48.800 --> 05:50.680
-It's caught. [laughs]

05:50.720 --> 05:52.040
-Gotcha.

05:52.079 --> 05:55.240
-Ow, thanks.

05:55.279 --> 05:57.800
We should probably stop anyway.

05:57.839 --> 05:58.639
-Mmm.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.279
-From the developpe?

06:00.319 --> 06:00.920
-Yeah.

06:00.959 --> 06:04.399
Just gimme a second.

06:04.439 --> 06:05.680
-Sorry.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.839
Didn't realize this was torture.

06:07.879 --> 06:09.360
-Well, I thought
about charging you

06:09.399 --> 06:13.600
for war crimes, but-- [laughs].

06:13.639 --> 06:14.759
Mmm.

06:14.800 --> 06:20.519
Actually, um, have
you ever, you know?

06:20.560 --> 06:23.399
It's, we've been doing
this for a while.

06:23.439 --> 06:28.680
And it could be
worth discussing.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.480
-The next level?

06:32.639 --> 06:34.480
We're not ready.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.800
-No.

06:35.839 --> 06:36.639
No.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.800
No, we're not ready.

06:38.839 --> 06:40.319
Hmm.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.800
-Mm, now from the developpe?

06:42.839 --> 06:45.639
Or do you need more time?

06:45.680 --> 06:47.800
-Funny.

06:47.839 --> 06:51.040
-So what's the verdict?

06:51.079 --> 06:52.720
-Obnoxiously healthy.

06:52.759 --> 06:54.279
I'm going to recommend
to the company

06:54.319 --> 06:55.639
that you start work immediately.

06:58.759 --> 06:59.519
-Hey, Damo.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.800
-Hey.

07:00.839 --> 07:03.399
-Oh Damien, you
can go on through.

07:03.439 --> 07:04.360
-OK.

07:04.399 --> 07:04.800
-Oh, let me--

07:04.839 --> 07:05.600
-Thanks.

07:05.639 --> 07:06.639
-How's it going?

07:06.680 --> 07:08.240
-Good.

07:08.279 --> 07:08.680
You?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.040
-Oh yeah.

07:10.079 --> 07:11.839
-You haven't seen Tara
Webster, first year?

07:11.879 --> 07:13.160
-Uh, no ma'am.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.480
-I heard someone was
organizing a dance.

07:21.519 --> 07:23.319
You don't do that enough?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.040
-Can I interest you in a ticket?

07:25.079 --> 07:26.759
It's a winter wonderland theme.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.839
Kat says it's lame, but--

07:27.879 --> 07:31.480
-But you've never seen snow.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.480
You should be getting
off that soon, right?

07:33.519 --> 07:34.639
TARA: Uh huh, soon.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.120
-I was at the clinic yesterday.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.800
How come you missed
your appointment?

07:37.839 --> 07:41.319
-Ah, I just got my times wrong.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.600
CHRISTIAN: Hey.

07:42.639 --> 07:43.560
-Hi.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.800
-Hey.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.680
Well, I'll get back to
you about the ticket.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.800
-Did I uh, interrupt something?

07:49.839 --> 07:50.800
-Yes.

07:50.839 --> 07:52.160
He was asking me how my knee is.

07:52.199 --> 07:53.439
And no one has in the
last five minutes.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.800
I so badly wanted
to talk about it.

07:56.839 --> 08:02.399
Hey, I'm kinda sick of watching,
and you can't dance without me.

08:02.439 --> 08:06.279
-Are you asking
me to ditch class?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.240
MISS RAINE: Ladies,
you're boring me.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.839
Cinderella has just
arrived at the ball.

08:09.879 --> 08:11.680
Let's see a spark of excitement.

08:19.839 --> 08:21.480
SAMMY: What?

08:21.519 --> 08:22.160
-Nothing.

08:25.319 --> 08:28.720
-Look, about yesterday.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.079
I feel bad.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.120
Might have seemed
like I was, you know.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.080
MISS RAINE: Where's Christian?

08:34.120 --> 08:37.240
And Tara?

08:37.279 --> 08:40.399
-You know, like I
was pressuring you.

08:40.440 --> 08:45.279
Which I don't want you to think,
because I respect the fact

08:45.320 --> 08:48.279
that you're not ready.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.759
MISS RAINE: Next group!

08:51.799 --> 08:54.120
-Actually, I've changed my mind.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.519
[whispers] I think we're ready.

09:08.399 --> 09:10.799
-Sorry, I just stroked
out there for a second.

09:10.840 --> 09:11.799
Ready as in--

09:11.840 --> 09:13.080
-Ready.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.440
But if you don't
agree, we can wait.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.679
-No!

09:16.720 --> 09:17.799
I'm a guy.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
I'm hard wired to
think I'm ready.

09:18.879 --> 09:20.200
-It's ballet, Samuel.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.320
Communicate through
actions, not words.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.039
-Well, let's embrace the
cliche at the formal.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.200
It'll be special.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.480
TARA: Aren't you afraid
the best years of our lives

09:35.519 --> 09:36.279
are passing us by?

09:36.320 --> 09:37.320
-While we're stuck dancing?

09:37.360 --> 09:38.759
Yes, it's my constant refrain.

09:38.799 --> 09:41.639
TARA: Which is what the formal's
all about, avoiding FOMO.

09:41.679 --> 09:43.799
-FOMO?

09:43.840 --> 09:45.720
-Fear of missing out.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.360
Tomorrow night,
you'll feel it when

09:47.399 --> 09:50.360
you're at the boarding house in
your PJs and I am at the formal

09:50.399 --> 09:54.360
wearing this.

09:54.399 --> 09:56.360
It's almost perfect, isn't it?

09:56.399 --> 10:00.159
KAT: [clears throat]
You'll thank me.

10:00.200 --> 10:00.639
Go get in it.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.679
TARA: What about this?

10:31.720 --> 10:33.600
-[gasps].

10:33.639 --> 10:34.200
Oh.

10:36.799 --> 10:37.799
Oh, you know what?

10:37.840 --> 10:42.600
If I can find a date, I'll come.

10:42.639 --> 10:44.679
-So you and Tara.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.399
How's it going?

10:48.200 --> 10:53.360
I mean, you're close, but
you're not you know, close.

10:53.399 --> 10:54.320
It's Tara.

10:54.360 --> 10:59.360
[laughs] Tell me you're not--

10:59.399 --> 11:00.320
-No!

11:00.360 --> 11:01.759
No, we're not.

11:01.799 --> 11:03.600
-I assume though that-- wait,
can we stop for a second?

11:06.519 --> 11:10.320
That you've been close
with someone in the past?

11:10.360 --> 11:12.799
-Mate, I don't want
to talk about this.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.639
-No.

11:13.679 --> 11:15.679
No, of course not.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.639
-Why?

11:17.679 --> 11:20.639
You and Abigail are--

11:20.679 --> 11:22.799
SAMMY: She's requesting special.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.039
And I'm not sure how to deliver.

11:26.080 --> 11:31.320
-Uh, it's not special
when it's rushed.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.679
And if it feels wrong,
I mean, it probably is.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.679
-Great.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.639
But I'm more thinking logistics.

11:37.679 --> 11:38.600
Music?

11:38.639 --> 11:39.240
Location?

11:42.320 --> 11:45.279
What are your thoughts
on manscaping?

11:45.320 --> 11:48.360
-Timmy, my good, good friend.

11:48.399 --> 11:51.600
Please don't tell me you already
have a date for tomorrow night.

11:51.639 --> 11:52.320
-Uh, no.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.720
Not going.

11:53.759 --> 11:54.639
I've got an interview with
the company to worry about.

11:54.679 --> 11:56.240
-Really?

11:56.279 --> 11:57.639
Oh, I, I thought you got an
early offer from New Zealand

11:57.679 --> 11:58.799
Ballet.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.240
-Yeah, but the
National's the dream.

12:00.279 --> 12:02.240
I'm gonna call New Zealand
and knock them back.

12:02.279 --> 12:03.720
-That's a bit drastic.

12:03.759 --> 12:06.320
I mean, don't you want to
keep your options open?

12:06.360 --> 12:07.720
-Well, they wouldn't
interview me

12:07.759 --> 12:10.519
if they weren't serious, Kat.

12:10.559 --> 12:11.799
-Right, you're right.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.840
Uh, unless they need to be
seen to follow a process

12:14.879 --> 12:18.159
or whatever.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.039
-Unbelievable!

12:20.080 --> 12:20.559
-Tim.

12:32.639 --> 12:34.600
-Have you seen my sister?

12:34.639 --> 12:37.200
-I think she's giving into FOMO.

12:37.240 --> 12:37.799
Why?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.279
-Oh, no reason.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.480
Other than that she just
told the whole world I've

12:40.519 --> 12:41.720
been offered a contract
with the company.

12:41.759 --> 12:42.480
-You have?

12:42.519 --> 12:43.159
That's amazing!

12:43.200 --> 12:43.639
Congratulations!

12:43.679 --> 12:44.759
-Yes.

12:44.799 --> 12:45.799
Except it's because
of Damien Lang.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.360
And it's only just
been confirmed

12:47.399 --> 12:50.360
that he's out permanently,
so it's really bad timing.

12:50.399 --> 12:53.679
-Damo's not gonna dance again.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.159
-No.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.159
But every injury's
different, so I-

12:57.200 --> 12:57.799
-Yeah, of course.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.440
Absolutely.

13:01.799 --> 13:03.440
-What are you doing, Tara?

13:03.480 --> 13:05.279
I thought you were
someone who'd do anything

13:05.320 --> 13:06.440
to get back into dancing.

13:10.200 --> 13:17.799
-You know, before
getting injured was like,

13:17.840 --> 13:19.159
my worst nightmare.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.399
-It's normal to be scared.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.080
-No.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.399
See, that's the thing.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.399
I go through days where
no one yells at me.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.120
Where I'm not trying as hard
as I can and still never

13:27.159 --> 13:28.080
being good enough.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.399
You're not supposed to say
it, but I like being injured.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.519
I like having a--

13:34.559 --> 13:35.240
-Boyfriend.

13:35.279 --> 13:36.480
-Life!

13:36.519 --> 13:38.360
I like not dancing.

13:38.399 --> 13:40.799
-You wouldn't say that
if it was forever.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.720
TARA: How do you know?

13:43.759 --> 13:45.120
-I know you.

13:57.679 --> 13:58.279
-Hey.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.320
-Hey.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.639
How's Tara?

14:04.679 --> 14:07.159
-Yeah, she's fine.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.159
-It's just, we were
talking last night

14:09.200 --> 14:11.720
and she seemed pretty upset.

14:11.759 --> 14:13.559
-Well, it must just be you then.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.399
She's fine with me.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.200
-Have you even asked her why she
hasn't got her plaster off yet?

14:18.240 --> 14:20.320
-Is it hard still hanging
around for scraps?

14:20.360 --> 14:24.120
--[laughs] Mate, your girlfriend
came to me when she needed

14:24.159 --> 14:25.360
someone to talk to.

14:25.399 --> 14:27.200
Not sure what you
mean about scraps.

14:33.279 --> 14:34.799
-Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.320
-I'm warming up.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.000
-Incorrect.

14:37.039 --> 14:38.320
You're bludging with me.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.279
-Tara, I can't.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.639
I have to keep up attendance.

14:41.679 --> 14:43.080
-OK.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.039
-Hey, are you OK?

14:46.080 --> 14:48.200
-Oh yeah, just formal stuff.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.200
Couldn't be better.

15:02.360 --> 15:02.639
-Webster!

15:06.639 --> 15:08.639
Reckon there's something
in the country water

15:08.679 --> 15:10.639
that's bad for the knees?

15:10.679 --> 15:12.600
-Maybe.

15:12.639 --> 15:14.200
-So, heard my news?

15:14.240 --> 15:14.679
-No.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.639
Just rumors.

15:15.679 --> 15:17.559
-Ah well, they're probably true.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.399
The ligaments are shot, so.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.480
It's OK.

15:21.519 --> 15:23.159
I'm gonna help Dad
out on the property.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.799
I'm actually looking forward
to getting out of the city.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.399
[laughs] Can't believe it's
been 10 years since I got here.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.120
-Really?

15:30.159 --> 15:33.799
-18 since I first stepped
foot in a ballet studio.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.120
Yeah, you know.

15:35.159 --> 15:36.360
It's probably time
for something else.

15:39.679 --> 15:43.120
[weeping] I'm sorry.

15:43.159 --> 15:46.519
[weeping]

15:49.840 --> 15:51.360
DR. WICKS: You ready?

15:54.360 --> 15:55.639
[buzzing]

16:24.840 --> 16:29.399
[knocking  on door]

16:29.440 --> 16:30.759
-May I come in?

16:30.799 --> 16:33.240
-I was just-- yeah, sure.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.639
-I saw Dr. Wicks.

16:42.679 --> 16:45.320
The initial MRI seems positive.

16:45.360 --> 16:49.200
How hard you work in rehab will
be critical to ongoing damage.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.399
I wish I could believe
you're up to it.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.320
-Miss Raine, I know
my focus has wandered

16:53.360 --> 16:54.320
in the past couple of weeks.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.600
-It's been the whole year, Tara.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.559
-That's not fair.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.559
I've worked.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.799
-When it suited you.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.840
The wasteful part is
you have potential.

17:01.879 --> 17:03.799
-But I'm untrained and--

17:03.840 --> 17:07.279
-More potential than you know.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.480
Unfortunately, it's not enough
to carry you through this.

17:10.519 --> 17:13.079
Are you gonna commit
100% to becoming

17:13.118 --> 17:16.200
the dancer you're
supposed to be?

17:16.240 --> 17:21.680
Or are you gonna keep on
throwing it away on this?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.118
-It's just a formal.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.358
MISS RAINE: No, it's not.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.839
And as much as you may
wish to have everything,

17:28.880 --> 17:32.480
it's just not possible.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.279
-I manscaped.

17:34.319 --> 17:35.599
Didn't know it was so itchy.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.359
-Don't do that.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.839
-Hi.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.200
-Stop looking at me like that!

18:03.240 --> 18:05.039
-Sorry.

18:05.079 --> 18:07.160
-What if I said I had
a surprise for you?

18:07.200 --> 18:10.079
-I'd say, me first.

18:10.119 --> 18:11.640
Can't believe you didn't notice.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.400
-You got your cast off.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.240
-Yeah.

18:14.279 --> 18:15.400
It was actually long overdue.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.559
Boring story.

18:18.599 --> 18:24.839
[dance music playing]

18:24.880 --> 18:26.799
-No snow, but--

18:26.839 --> 18:28.480
-It looks awesome.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.799
KAT: Hi!

18:40.839 --> 18:42.240
You look gorgeous!

18:42.279 --> 18:44.240
So I, I had to scrape
the bottom of the barrel,

18:44.279 --> 18:45.319
but I found a date.

18:45.359 --> 18:46.400
He couldn't get one either.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.039
-You look good out
of your plaster.

18:48.079 --> 18:49.559
-We'll see you later, yeah?

18:55.079 --> 18:57.400
-You don't mind if we stand
here for a bit, do you?

18:57.440 --> 19:00.359
My knee's not up to
anything too fast.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.119
-You know, it's the first
time you've mentioned it.

19:03.160 --> 19:03.799
-My knee?

19:03.839 --> 19:05.599
No it's not.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.200
-To me, I mean.

19:12.599 --> 19:16.200
[music playing]

19:32.839 --> 19:34.440
[crowd cheers]

19:55.200 --> 19:56.039
-I'm so sorry.

19:56.079 --> 19:57.319
It wasn't intentional.

19:57.359 --> 19:58.599
I just opened my mouth
and then everything--

19:58.640 --> 19:59.640
-You know what?

19:59.680 --> 20:01.119
I'm out of this place.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.200
I don't care what they think.

20:15.839 --> 20:16.640
-Sorry.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.160
I got fixated on music.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.119
And then I went down this
creepy rose petal path

20:21.160 --> 20:24.079
before I realized that
was trying too hard.

20:47.839 --> 20:49.680
It's probably not what
you meant by special.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.480
We should rain check.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.799
-No.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.079
It's perfect.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.559
-What made you change your mind?

21:12.079 --> 21:14.200
-I get these
glimpses where I want

21:14.240 --> 21:18.039
to be about more
than just dancing.

21:18.079 --> 21:20.480
Why did you?

21:20.519 --> 21:21.480
-[laughs]

21:31.240 --> 21:33.480
-Can't believe you got
me a surprise as well.

21:33.519 --> 21:34.559
-You sure you should be--

21:34.599 --> 21:38.240
-It can handle one dance.

21:38.279 --> 21:40.599
-How should I know?

21:40.640 --> 21:45.519
I mean, I'm not-- what is it?--
sensitive or smart enough to be

21:45.559 --> 21:46.720
told the details.

21:46.759 --> 21:49.640
-I don't get why you're
so caught up on this.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.720
-You spoke to him, right?

21:51.759 --> 21:53.160
About your knee?

21:53.200 --> 21:54.720
Had a little heart to heart?

21:54.759 --> 21:55.799
-Yeah.

21:55.839 --> 21:56.759
But you don't need
to be jealous.

21:56.799 --> 21:58.680
He just, he just gets it.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.039
-Gets what?

22:01.079 --> 22:03.640
-That side of me,
the dancing side.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.799
-And I don't?

22:04.839 --> 22:06.319
-No.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.480
You're like the other-- I
don't know how to explain it

22:08.519 --> 22:09.160
properly, but--

22:09.200 --> 22:10.799
-No, it's pretty clear.

22:10.839 --> 22:13.400
He gets you, I don't.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.359
TARA (VOICEOVER): There
are lessons in fairy tales.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.559
Even wearing the perfect
dress, Cinderella

22:18.599 --> 22:21.799
discovered that the perfect
night can't last forever.

22:21.839 --> 22:22.799
-Hey.

22:22.839 --> 22:24.759
Can we just stop for a second?

22:31.160 --> 22:33.240
It doesn't feel right.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.720
And it should.

22:40.839 --> 22:42.319
You deserve that.

22:46.319 --> 22:48.119
-OK.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.519
Yeah, it's a good decision.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.759
TARA (VOICEOVER):
When midnight came,

22:53.799 --> 22:59.599
the fantasy ended and real
life switched on the lights.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.200
-You know what?

23:01.240 --> 23:03.200
You don't have a right to know
about my knee or my dancing.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.640
If you hadn't made
me stay at the beach,

23:04.680 --> 23:06.279
then we wouldn't have been
rushing and none of this

23:06.319 --> 23:07.799
would have ever happened!

23:07.839 --> 23:08.759
-That's what you think?

23:08.799 --> 23:10.240
-I don't know what to think!

23:10.279 --> 23:12.240
Except everyone keeps
telling me that I'm wasting

23:12.279 --> 23:15.440
time, that I have to choose!

23:15.480 --> 23:17.640
-Well, let me make
it easy for you then.

23:40.559 --> 23:43.039
-You made it snow!

23:43.079 --> 23:46.279
-Christian did, as a surprise.

23:46.319 --> 23:48.400
-What's wrong, pumpkin?

23:55.200 --> 23:57.599
