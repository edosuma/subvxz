WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.264
Ah!

00:03.264 --> 00:05.048
You know, Kyle'’s
coming back, right?

00:05.048 --> 00:08.530
And the chief stew, they'’re
having an immigration issue now,

00:08.530 --> 00:09.966
they'’re trying to get
their visa.

00:09.966 --> 00:12.577
- Okay.
- I need you to take command.

00:12.577 --> 00:15.102
Easy.
I just like to be in charge.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.626
I know how things should go.

00:17.626 --> 00:20.107
Hi! You made it!

00:20.107 --> 00:22.631
- And Kyle'’s coming later.
- Yes.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.982
I met Kyle at the consulate
when I was getting my visa.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.810
Kyle obviously told me
that he had

00:27.810 --> 00:29.246
his ups and downs with Natalya.

00:29.246 --> 00:31.292
So, what do you
think of the boat?

00:31.292 --> 00:33.120
The organization'’s a sh---show.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.817
- Excuse me?
- I'’m not talking about you.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.949
Yeah, I was talking about
the actual boat itself.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.081
Yeah.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.301
No, no, no, trust me.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.780
She'’s been here for
like half an hour.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.086
Booyah!

00:43.086 --> 00:46.089
Whoever issued this,
it'’s not yours.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.612
I can'’t leave the dock
with you on board.

00:47.612 --> 00:48.961
Will you be
the full-time bosun?

00:48.961 --> 00:50.485
I would love to.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.617
By our next charter,
you'’ll have a new deckhand.

00:52.617 --> 00:55.185
- My name is Max. I'’m French.
- Nice to meet you, brother.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.453
You know?
Grr!

01:02.453 --> 01:04.629
Mecca Moore-Henson is a
New York-based founder

01:04.629 --> 01:05.935
of a lifestyle magazine.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.285
Mecca will be joined by
her husband, Antoine.

01:08.285 --> 01:11.114
And Adjua, oh, plant-based.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.507
When you'’ve got nine guests,

01:12.507 --> 01:14.248
you want all this meat
and fish and all that,

01:14.248 --> 01:15.249
and then you'’ve got
one person who wants vegan.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.467
It'’s a balancing act.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.165
Now, how are we
rating this vegan meal?

01:18.165 --> 01:19.818
- Six.
- Well, God damn.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.124
It'’s the last call for alcohol.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.517
Cheers, guys.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.696
I just like, I just can'’t deal.

01:27.696 --> 01:28.784
Tumi...

01:31.743 --> 01:34.137
I would rather him go to bed
as soon as possible.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.573
Not professional.

01:35.573 --> 01:36.705
Oh, my God.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.054
I am fine with it.
End of the story.

01:38.054 --> 01:39.708
Stop doing things
with your hands.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.624
I'’m a first-time chief stew,
but I know what I'’m doing.

01:42.624 --> 01:45.844
She has no respect,
and I'’ve just had it.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.195
We'’re done.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.674
You have been attacking me
since day one.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.502
Hon, you stepped on board
with no appreciation.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.591
- There was no thank you.
- Bye, Natalya. Bye.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.265
And you stepped on board
with no appreciation.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.876
- There was no thank you.
- Bye, Natalya.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.574
Oh, my God.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.402
Oh, my Lord.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.116
- Good morning.
- Hello.

02:40.116 --> 02:41.596
There'’s no wind.
We can leave the dock.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.641
Finally.
We'’re out of here.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.083
Did something happen just now?

02:51.083 --> 02:52.607
Yeah.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.217
Apparently I'’ve been
attacking her since day one.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.655
Last night she messaged me.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.269
Yeah, go ahead.
I'’m off to----ing Mykonos.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.792
She can suck my balls.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.231
<i>All crew, all crew.</i>

03:08.231 --> 03:10.407
Deporting the dock
in ten minutes.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.455
The railings.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.249
- Can you take this fender off?
- What did you say?

03:26.249 --> 03:28.251
- Can you take the fender off?
- Oh.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.645
And this, the railing,
you tell me?

03:30.645 --> 03:32.299
I'’ll go down and
I'’ll reach it from you.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.431
I'’m working with
French people, normally.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.962
Where does go, the fenders?

03:43.962 --> 03:45.964
You got it, honey.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.923
I----ing hate her.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.881
- What'’s going on?
- She'’s got an issue with me.

03:50.969 --> 03:54.016
I know.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.496
Natalya and Tumi fighting.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.280
It needs to get sorted out
right now.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.803
If this goes on
for another charter,

03:58.803 --> 04:00.588
that'’s going to cause
a divide in the crew.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.677
The whole vibe of
the boat'’s going to drop.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.118
You just get the charter
out of the way

04:09.118 --> 04:10.206
and we'’ll sit down properly.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.599
I'’m too busy at the moment.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.122
Me and Lara,
we'’re going to go forward.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.603
Sweet. So me and you are going
to be on the stern.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.214
- Yeah?
- Single up the two lines.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.476
Coming.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.913
All right, let'’s smash this.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.744
We'’re finally leaving the dock
with a full deck team.

04:26.744 --> 04:30.270
It'’s going to be a good test to
see how everyone works together.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.575
See Max in action, you know?

04:32.446 --> 04:34.230
Yeah.
Get ready to go.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.536
You can start
dropping the lines.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.364
- You got it?
- Yeah.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.845
Hopefully it'’s going
to be easier.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.066
- Good.
- Drop it.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.720
- Belissimo.
- Bravo.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.895
Grazie, Signore.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.723
Bridge, that'’s
all stern lines in.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.292
Drop the starboard ground line.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.902
Bridge, you got five meters,

04:53.902 --> 04:57.209
port quarter and plenty of room
on your starboard side.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.516
- We'’re moving.
- We got out.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.518
Starboard ground line is off.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.346
Your stern is now clear.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.783
<i>Deck crew,
that is an excellent job.</i>

05:08.569 --> 05:09.961
Okay, great. Thanks.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.836
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.577
This is going up.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.361
Do you like coffee?
How would you like your coffee?

05:18.361 --> 05:20.102
Ah, black. Two sugars.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.799
Tumi, do you know how
to make a proper mimosa?

05:21.799 --> 05:22.931
How do you like it?

05:22.931 --> 05:24.062
- Well, let me show you honey.
- Oh boy.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.586
Oh!

05:25.586 --> 05:26.891
So there'’s no confusion.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.940
That'’s my type of mimosa.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.898
Good morning.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.726
We'’re out.
We'’re going out of the port.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.294
If it'’s too swelly, we're not
putting those docks out.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.774
Let'’s put the
jetskis out first.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.603
Maybe go to the laz and
just pull out that toe line.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.344
I'’m thinking I'm going
to get a line,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.041
tie it to the bow
of the jet skis,

05:46.041 --> 05:48.957
so that carabineer doesn'’t get
unhooked all the time.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.567
So like a little bowline
and a little bowline.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.875
I love Lara'’s enthusiasm
to just get involved.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.442
So it'’s just easier
done and we can tie up.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.834
Yeah, yeah.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.575
This is my first time in
a management position,

05:58.575 --> 06:00.969
and I feel like I don'’t have
to tell her what to do.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.623
She just knows.
She just does it.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.147
Having her there is definitely
making my job easier.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.627
- Yeah.
- Do that, for sure.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.759
Cheffy, I want to hear
the special.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.153
- Smoked haddock.
- Smoked haddock.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.763
I kind of want to eat now.

06:12.763 --> 06:15.766
- Let'’s get Tumi.
- Meow.

06:15.766 --> 06:18.813
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Tumi.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.119
- How are you?
- Good, good, good.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.469
I mean, look at where we at.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.427
Now I understand
why people do it every year.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.863
Breakfast.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.606
So the special,
it'’s a smoked haddock.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.434
- I like that.
- And poached egg, okay?

06:34.045 --> 06:35.133
Okay.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.352
What a day.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.658
How'’s your deck team?

06:37.658 --> 06:39.050
They'’re doing really
good, actually.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.618
Lara'’s doing really well.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.315
- She'’s a worker.
- Yeah, she'’s cool.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.665
Well, I wanted to ask you about

06:44.665 --> 06:47.015
the whole lead deckhand thing.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.103
Would you like me to?

06:48.103 --> 06:49.626
- Yeah.
- You do you.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.845
I'’ll have to think about it.

06:50.845 --> 06:51.715
Okay, cool.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.325
This is a breakfast special,

06:53.325 --> 06:54.892
but she wants it
with scrambled eggs.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.459
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.505
And then a side of potatoes
home fries.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.203
Deck crew, deck crew.
Prepare to drop the anchor.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.813
We'’re going to drop
the starboard anchor.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.859
- You want to drop it?
- Yeah.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.469
Slowing down.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.210
Goes out really fast, so you
just got to find the sweet spot.

07:08.210 --> 07:11.126
Yeah, because me,
I'’m more on smaller boats.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.475
Are you comfortable doing that?

07:12.475 --> 07:13.824
Yeah. Completely.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.522
We'’re going to go
three in the water.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.740
- Go?
- Yeah.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.529
That'’s three shackles out.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.661
Okay, you can
put the anchor ball up.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.184
Sweet.
Anchor ball'’s up.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.185
I wonder where we are.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.186
Italy, somewhere.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.840
Oh, yeah.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.060
All right. You want to go down
to the stern and help the girls,

07:32.060 --> 07:33.975
and I'’ll call you when
I want you up on the sun deck.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.498
Bravissimo.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.371
Tumi, I'’ve got breakfast ready.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.461
Only the best for the guests.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.898
Right, so we got Chef Special.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.073
Thank you.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.422
And you were having
a scramble, right?

07:46.422 --> 07:48.337
- Thank you, darling.
- Of course.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.513
Two mimosas. She didn'’t
have one yet. Give it to her.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.428
Okay.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.473
I hear Kyle.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.691
- Listen.
- Babe, I'’m done.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.476
No, what happened?

07:56.476 --> 07:57.868
I was like, are you able,
I just, you know,

07:57.868 --> 07:59.566
instead of, like,
popping clutter somewhere,

07:59.566 --> 08:01.045
just, like, deal with
clutter at the time.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.004
I was like, because,
like, I don'’t know,

08:03.004 --> 08:05.136
it could be, it could be,
but anyway, it'’s still there.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.964
Here is the potatoes.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.096
Thank you.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.445
She was not listening
to me, you know?

08:09.445 --> 08:11.273
She was going like,
no, no, no.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.579
You'’re talking sh-- now.

08:12.579 --> 08:13.928
Babe, I swear to God,
she'’s like,

08:13.928 --> 08:15.103
you'’ve disrespected me
from day one.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.104
I said, disrespected you?

08:19.150 --> 08:20.978
I could easily come
at her right away.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.592
I live for a good goss,

08:25.592 --> 08:27.637
but I'’m realizing
that my involvement

08:27.637 --> 08:29.204
has made the situation worse.

08:29.204 --> 08:32.599
I shared with Tumi how
my time on Motor Yacht Home

08:32.599 --> 08:34.296
went with Natalya,

08:34.296 --> 08:35.906
and Tumi'’s response was...

08:35.906 --> 08:37.517
"I know you'’re mates with her,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.301
"but she needs to stay
in her lane.

08:39.301 --> 08:43.566
"Tumi, losing her sh--,
will end in her walking off

08:43.566 --> 08:45.307
because she had a diva moment."

08:45.307 --> 08:48.136
I'’m really good at
getting information.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.790
My biggest problem is,

08:49.790 --> 08:52.140
I'’m not good at
keeping the information.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.925
It'’s not good.
Trust me, I know.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.318
Please, let me know
when you go up there,

08:56.318 --> 08:57.754
and just when you need it.

08:57.754 --> 08:58.799
So you know whether
to pack your bag or not.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.017
You'’re not going anywhere.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.195
How'’s everyone's food so far?

09:04.195 --> 09:05.849
- Really good.
- Good.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.549
We'’re going to get the toys out.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.463
Here you go, my G.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.682
Okay.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.816
You want to blow up
that trampoline, bro?

09:15.816 --> 09:17.774
Okay. I'’ll blow it up.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.210
Oh, it is beautiful outside.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.603
It'’s so pretty.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.087
Oh, my God.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.262
What'’s wrong?

09:27.262 --> 09:29.220
It'’s nothing you need
to worry about.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.353
Okay, that'’s not good.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.790
You can talk to me.

09:33.790 --> 09:37.098
I'’m a bit worried because...

09:37.098 --> 09:38.403
Natalya.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.667
It'’s just constant resistance.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.973
Oh, that'’s not good.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.803
Coming up...

09:46.803 --> 09:48.152
You okay, brother?

09:49.284 --> 09:50.894
What the [bleep] are you doing?

09:52.853 --> 09:55.116
We don'’t have time to----ing
sit around and wank.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.383
You can talk to me.

10:01.383 --> 10:05.430
I'’m a bit worried because Natalya...

10:05.430 --> 10:08.608
It'’s just like it's
constant resistance.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.740
Oh, that'’s not good.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.916
I feel like I just came in here

10:12.916 --> 10:14.396
and it was just like,
"I don'’t like her.

10:14.396 --> 10:17.007
I don'’t want you here.
I don'’t like you."

10:17.007 --> 10:18.618
It was, honestly,
Sandy, that'’s how it felt.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.968
I just wanted to get it,
like, done.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.230
I'’m going to let you handle it.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.754
And if you need me,
you'’ll call me.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.495
Yeah, I definitely have...

10:26.495 --> 10:27.931
I'’m going to ask
you, I think

10:27.931 --> 10:29.846
it'’s hard for someone
to adjust, I agree.

10:29.846 --> 10:33.241
I think if your approach
is one of kindness,

10:33.241 --> 10:35.504
you'’ll win instead
of one of authority.

10:35.504 --> 10:36.853
Yeah.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.333
I mean, look, I'’m going
to have a chat with her

10:38.333 --> 10:40.161
Yeah.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.337
And then if it doesn'’t change,
come to me and I'’ll talk to her.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.817
Okay, perfect.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.732
You know, as a second stew,
everyone loves you.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.168
But when you become the chief,

10:47.168 --> 10:49.953
that'’s when
the love isn'’t there.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.956
To lead, you'’re not always
going to be popular.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.697
I mean, how many people
like their boss?

10:54.697 --> 10:55.698
There'’s growing pains
of figuring out

10:55.698 --> 10:57.352
how to work together.

10:57.352 --> 11:01.617
They just have to get through
this initial uncomfortability.

11:01.617 --> 11:04.011
If it becomes a bigger issue,
then I'’ll step in.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.360
I'’m happy you're here.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.491
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.449
Of course.

11:11.627 --> 11:12.846
Oh, it is beautiful outside.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.631
- Hello, baby.
- It'’s so pretty.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.372
Captain Sandy said I'’m going
to bring you all the weather.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.374
How is it up there?
What'’s the vibe?

11:19.374 --> 11:21.245
- Fuming.
- Fuming.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.812
I'’m not sorry.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.164
Yeah.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.736
You okay, brother?

11:35.477 --> 11:36.826
Okay.

11:57.804 --> 11:58.892
Yeah, man.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.023
Oh, I like it.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.459
- How you doing?
- Hello.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.073
2:00-ish? And also...

12:07.378 --> 12:09.337
The primary wants to
surprise her friends

12:09.337 --> 12:12.340
for a beautiful lunch
at an amazing spot.

12:12.340 --> 12:15.212
Guests would like lunch in
exclusive outdoor space.

12:15.212 --> 12:19.216
So that outdoor space is an
actual castle, Santa Margarita.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.436
We got the Santa Margarita Castle.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.569
It was built in the 1600s,
and it used to be the site

12:24.569 --> 12:26.441
of these epic military raids.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.270
But now
it'’s a great picnic spot.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.272
They'’re looking at like
00-ish.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.664
Three tables, eight chairs.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.928
- Happy?
- Yeah, thank you.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.973
Housekeeping.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.804
I'’m going to go and
get to set up.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.240
I don'’t know if you want
anything set up.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.068
I'’d rather not have to
go at all, to be honest.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.809
I want to do a poke lunch.

12:46.809 --> 12:47.941
Perfect, I think that'’s great.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.464
Just a few big platters,

12:49.464 --> 12:51.031
and I'’ll do some lobsters
to keep them happy.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.424
All this sh-- going on
with the interior.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.137
Whether right or wrong.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.487
- But she'’s happy, so...
- All right, good, good.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.836
What a----ing mess.

13:13.836 --> 13:14.837
The way how she'’s gone
about everything

13:14.837 --> 13:16.273
is just----ing stupid.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.058
She'’s not being like,
coming up to me like,

13:18.058 --> 13:20.408
you Natalya, but she
is messaging behind my back,

13:20.408 --> 13:21.670
Oh, my gosh.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.715
We all have----ing
chief stew experience.

13:23.715 --> 13:24.934
How things
actually works.

13:24.934 --> 13:25.935
Right.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.328
Every time I see Natalya,

13:27.328 --> 13:30.331
she has another update
about whatever it is

13:30.331 --> 13:31.941
Tumi did wrong.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.161
Putting together the table,
just had to remove one thing.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.816
Then she'’s didn't say
thank you to anything.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.991
And I just said,
she came on board

13:37.991 --> 13:40.341
with the worst----ing attitude.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.299
It'’s like a small detail,
like, this morning.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.910
Like, I went up to Tumi
with any of this sh--.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.955
She was like, I only like maple
syrup and honey on the table.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.000
Well, apparently
you'’re like...

13:52.657 --> 13:56.052
Note to self, never get
on Nat'’s bad side.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.185
It'’s a hard no for me.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.187
- I want to do jetskis.
- All right.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.623
Nice.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.495
Pull throttle.

14:04.495 --> 14:05.627
Oh, this is about
to be a disaster.

14:07.672 --> 14:08.978
All right, I want to go.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.719
She looks so cute.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.852
Look at that ass.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.983
Ass, ladies, woo!

14:13.983 --> 14:16.551
Take it a little faster.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.987
Good morning.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.904
Yeah, yeah.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.210
Yeah, boy.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.168
- Go for it.
- Woo!

14:25.168 --> 14:26.735
Kyle, please, can you pull
some cutlery, Tumi.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.345
Copy that.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.089
I am gonna set it up, come back,

14:33.089 --> 14:34.308
and then you'’ll do to the service.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.309
Okay.

14:35.309 --> 14:36.614
Woo!

14:38.790 --> 14:40.357
- You want to come?
- Mm-hmm.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.011
Tumi, Tumi, we'’re ready to go.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.404
Okay.

14:43.404 --> 14:44.840
So, I'’m just gonna
set it up and come back.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.189
Okay.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.408
As soon as I get off,
go on your break, okay?

14:47.408 --> 14:48.626
All right.

14:48.626 --> 14:49.714
Wait, wait, wait,
let me disconnect this.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.107
Awesome.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.892
Oh, my God, I'’m so glad
to get off that boat.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.415
Hi! Kyle!

14:54.415 --> 14:56.852
I'’m excited for the castle.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.899
Tumi, you'’ve got three tables,
eight chairs, and a gazebo.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.030
Okay.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.250
- Is it up here?
- Oh!

15:03.250 --> 15:05.774
The castle literally overlooking
the port and the whole city.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.384
It'’s so beautiful.

15:07.384 --> 15:11.606
I wish I wasn'’t so----ing
high, but let'’s do it.

15:11.606 --> 15:15.523
All right, let'’s get all
of this on the roof of that.

15:15.523 --> 15:16.611
We go to the top.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.873
Oh, hell no.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.962
Ah!

15:24.010 --> 15:25.881
What the [bleep]?

15:25.881 --> 15:28.275
We don'’t have time to----ing
sit around and wank.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.059
What the [bleep] are you doing?

15:30.059 --> 15:31.931
Is it up here, brother?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.628
After you, your castle,
my princess.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.325
Oh!

15:35.325 --> 15:37.327
Get the hell out of here.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.941
Oh, sh--.

15:43.725 --> 15:44.813
This is cool.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.510
Where'’s the table, Max?

15:46.510 --> 15:49.122
I didn'’t bring the two tables
in one, bro. It was too heavy.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.689
<i>Tumi, Tumi, Luka.</i>

15:56.216 --> 15:58.000
Okay, I can do that.

16:04.137 --> 16:07.140
♪ La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la ♪

16:07.140 --> 16:09.098
I want to kick Max in the dick.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.274
Max, we just got to
go get the guests.

16:16.366 --> 16:20.196
It is exhausting to walk 1,000
feet, carry up this luggage.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.677
I hear my neck,
like this.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.463
We'’re actually getting
ready to go to lunch.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.988
<i>Tumi, Tumi. How much time
for it all to be set up?</i>

16:28.988 --> 16:30.685
I would say 15 minutes.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.688
<i>We'’ll probably be back at
the castle in 20 minutes.</i>

16:33.688 --> 16:34.863
Copy.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.517
Oui, oui.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.648
What do you say?

16:37.648 --> 16:39.041
There was the----ing
French guy.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.130
I can'’t make out
a word he says,

16:41.130 --> 16:42.610
so... I don'’t know.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.700
The dynamic we had on deck
was----ing amazing.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.354
But I'’m worried.

16:47.354 --> 16:50.357
Like, I'’ve come across a lot
of lazy people in yachting.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.576
It annoys me.
Annoys the sh-- out of me.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.752
Like, to me, yachting is
not just fun and games.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.406
It'’s----ing work.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.801
And if Max doesn'’t have
that mentality, trust me,

16:59.801 --> 17:03.022
I'’m going to----ing
say a few things.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.589
, I smell like a horse.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.200
Coming up...

17:07.200 --> 17:08.897
All right,
what'’s the issue this time?

17:08.897 --> 17:10.812
You said I'’ve done the cabins.
When you say that...

17:10.812 --> 17:12.161
They'’re freshened up for
the middle of the day, hon.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.380
Let me finish.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.164
Stop putting your hand
in my face.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.557
You'’re going to do this, then
I'’m going to do this to you.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.734
Tumi, Natalya,
to the bridge now.

17:19.734 --> 17:20.778
To the bridge.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.478
Great job.
Great job, my girl.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.392
Thank you.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.958
Maybe we should go down, Tumi.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.396
Excited for lunch
at the castle?

17:29.396 --> 17:31.137
Once I leave, pack up
some of this stuff.

17:31.137 --> 17:34.836
- Okay, easy.
- Let'’s go.

17:34.836 --> 17:35.880
Yeah. I don'’t care.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.231
- You guys ready to go?
- Yes.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.232
Sweet, let'’s do it.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.320
I'’m so excited.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.451
Tumi, Tumi, Luka.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.626
<i>I'’m on the way with the guests.</i>

17:42.626 --> 17:45.151
<i>Copy, we are on
our way to the dock.</i>

17:46.500 --> 17:47.936
Whoosh!

17:47.936 --> 17:51.026
- Hi!
- Hey!

17:52.636 --> 17:54.029
I got you.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.291
Beautiful.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.511
It'’s a beautiful
day today.

17:59.687 --> 18:00.992
Where is it?
Are we going in a car?

18:00.992 --> 18:02.255
- No.
- No, it'’s a walk.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.691
Up the hill.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.475
You don'’t know what
we just went through.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.608
I'’m not excited to do this
hike on day two on board.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.176
But you got to look
at the bright side on day three.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.873
My ass is going
to look fantastic.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.267
- That'’s really high up there.
- I can'’t believe myself.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.142
<i>Max, Max.
Can you hear me? I'’m on my way.</i>

18:21.143 --> 18:23.580
Oh, this is gorgeous.

18:23.580 --> 18:26.148
Today, we have self-service
poke bowls

18:26.148 --> 18:28.498
with everything that you need.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.283
I'’ll have a look for champagne.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.372
What'’s up, Frenchie?

18:33.503 --> 18:34.765
Well, let'’s dig in, guys.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.027
This looks yummy.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.943
- It'’s really good.
- Oh, this is delicious.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.815
Yeah, I'’m here for it.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.776
What a beautiful day.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.604
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.867
How'’s it going?
What have you been doing?

18:51.608 --> 18:54.220
<i>Hey, Tumi, could either you
or maybe Natalya come with me?</i>

18:54.220 --> 18:55.743
We'’ll pack everything up.

18:55.743 --> 18:56.918
<i>I'’ll go.</i>

18:56.918 --> 18:58.398
Okay, Natalya'’s going
to go with you.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.703
Chef'’s doing his thing.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.704
Do you want to go
for another round?

19:00.704 --> 19:01.879
You want me to clear for you?

19:01.879 --> 19:03.054
I think I'’m done.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.447
You'’re done, honey?
Okay.

19:04.447 --> 19:05.535
- Where are we going?
- We'’re going on a date.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.972
You----ing cheating on me.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.323
I just want to get off
this boat at this point,

19:10.323 --> 19:12.673
take a break away
from the Tuminator.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.111
It'’s fine. As long as the
guest cabins are done.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.895
- Have fun, bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.

19:17.895 --> 19:21.334
Let'’s move cruise
back to Australia.

19:21.334 --> 19:24.685
Jesus Christ!

19:24.685 --> 19:27.731
Anything along the storefront,
here'’s all your good stores.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.038
Okay.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.347
The cabins are not finished.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.437
Okay, they'’re just not.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.742
There'’s spots on the mirror.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.701
There'’s still trash
in the bin.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.877
I want her to go have fun
and go out and see things

19:42.877 --> 19:44.531
and not just be stuck
on the boat.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.097
But if it'’s not done,

19:46.097 --> 19:47.838
I would have just appreciated
her saying, you know what?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.057
This is what I'’ve done.
This is what I haven'’t done.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.101
Then I can step in.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.712
Like, I just...

19:51.712 --> 19:53.627
Don'’t tell me something
is done and it'’s not done.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.455
That'’s how things get missed.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.720
I'’ve got to pack everything up.
They want to do some shopping.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.461
They don'’t want a crew
to go with them.

20:01.461 --> 20:02.723
I'’m getting too old
for this sh--.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.115
I want a 20-minute heads-up

20:04.115 --> 20:06.117
and I can go back and
pick up the guests.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.423
- Ah!
- How you doing?

20:07.423 --> 20:08.424
I'’m pooped.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.209
The French guy is so lazy.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.645
I don'’t know what he's doing.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.994
He'’s probably sitting
and----ing wanking.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.128
No, not those chairs.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.608
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.262
- How are you?
- I'’m good.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.307
How was the beach set up?

20:21.307 --> 20:22.308
Really pretty.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.526
Okay, let'’s go.

20:23.526 --> 20:24.614
I was just going
through the cabins.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.268
I'’m just going to tell you.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.010
When we'’re doing turn-ups, for
me, the biggest thing is trash.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.841
I can see that this
hasn'’t been wiped.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.016
Yeah.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.584
For sure.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.063
No, no. I don'’t even care
if they'’re not done.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.414
Natalya, she just told me
cabins were done.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.763
But if you say they'’re done,

20:42.763 --> 20:43.981
I expect, like, do
you know what I mean?

20:43.981 --> 20:45.635
Oh, you can tell me,
you know what?

20:45.635 --> 20:46.680
I haven'’t finished this.
I haven'’t finished that.

20:46.680 --> 20:47.681
That'’s perfectly fine.

20:47.681 --> 20:50.336
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

20:50.336 --> 20:52.425
My fat rolls!

20:53.948 --> 20:55.428
Now I'’m going to return back
to the hobbit hole

20:55.428 --> 20:56.429
under the waterline.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.430
Bravo. Grazia.

20:57.430 --> 20:58.518
Thank you.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.867
- Are they done?
- Yeah.

20:59.867 --> 21:00.998
All finished.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.438
Have you had a break today?

21:05.438 --> 21:07.048
No. I'’m going
to have mine later.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.443
It'’s so serene.
It'’s peaceful.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.619
I love that.

21:13.663 --> 21:14.925
It'’s so different.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.100
Absolutely stunning.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.450
She'’s like,
I won'’t buy anything.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.625
- What?
- I can'’t do this.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.670
I can'’t.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.850
Bitch, I can literally see you.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.678
I just went to the beach and
carried everything down.

21:28.678 --> 21:29.679
I just did all of the cabins.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.159
I just got off break

21:31.159 --> 21:32.856
and she just said
that she'’s annoyed

21:32.856 --> 21:35.729
because the cabins
aren'’t done.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.034
What?
They'’re fricking done.

21:37.034 --> 21:37.948
They all have towels.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.689
She was, like, trash in there.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.865
We'’re not going to keep changing
out three times a----ing day.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.867
<i>Tumi, Tumi, can you please come
to the bridge deck bar?</i>

21:43.867 --> 21:45.347
Copy.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.044
I feel like she just wants
to have a go all the time.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.655
It'’s the second time
we'’re on cabins today.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.221
It'’s a check-up.
Nothing will ever be okay.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.527
What'’s up?

21:51.527 --> 21:52.615
All right, what'’s the
issue this time?

21:52.615 --> 21:54.051
We'’ve done the cabins today.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.357
We'’ve just quickly
done a quick check-up.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.706
We'’ve made all the beds again.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.360
If you say cabins are done,

21:58.360 --> 22:01.145
that means that your shower
doors have been wiped.

22:01.145 --> 22:03.887
Everything was done this
morning, that was a freshen up.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.282
You could have done the cabins.
When you say that...

22:07.282 --> 22:08.892
They'’re freshened up for the
middle of the day, hun.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.678
- Well, I am the chief stew.
- Congratulations.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.029
Where?

22:15.029 --> 22:16.770
Out of all the crew,
there'’s only one person

22:16.770 --> 22:18.554
I'’m not getting along with.
And that happens to you.

22:18.554 --> 22:19.903
You had a problem with me
from the beginning.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.078
You literally...

22:21.078 --> 22:22.384
You stepped on and
started nitpicking.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.517
- Okay.
- I made you bed for you.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.040
Where is she?

22:26.040 --> 22:27.128
Let me finish.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.564
Stop putting your hand
in my face.

22:28.564 --> 22:31.350
Let me finish.
Don'’t scream at me.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.873
If you'’re going to do this, then
I'’m going to do this to you.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.571
Tumi, Natalya,
to the bridge now.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.791
- To the bridge.
- Amazing.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.270
You really are something else.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.882
I'’m over her and I'm done.

22:41.882 --> 22:44.624
I'’m sorry, but out of
everyone on this boat,

22:45.973 --> 22:47.453
First and foremost,
thank you for everything

22:47.453 --> 22:48.628
you did for the boat.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.760
I can'’t tolerate this.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.066
Captain, can I please
tell you my side?

22:52.066 --> 22:54.198
Because I gave a
very nice handover.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.809
Straight away, nitpicked
and the moment I said,

22:55.809 --> 22:57.941
texting Kyle
behind my back.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.901
I have no problem
firing Natalya.

23:00.901 --> 23:04.557
But she hadn'’t
even meet me.

23:04.557 --> 23:07.560
I said...
Excuse me.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.909
No, no, no.
That'’s not okay.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.127
I agree, but I have no problem.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.956
But please...
That'’s not okay.

23:12.956 --> 23:16.220
You do not make fun of people
while I'’m in the room.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.788
- You'’re in a leadership role.
- I agree, Sandy.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.573
You need to rise above
and figure this out.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.575
Because right now, I'’m ready
to put you both off the boat.

23:29.103 --> 23:32.019
You do not make fun of people
while I'’m in the room.

23:32.019 --> 23:33.542
- You'’re in a leadership role.
- I agree, Sandy.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.588
You need to rise above
and figure this out.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.373
Because right now, I'’m ready
to put you both off the boat.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.418
Copy.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.202
Okay.
Figure it out.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.465
You have to respect each
other in the workplace.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.727
You can'’t do this.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.686
This is behavior
that can'’t happen.

23:46.686 --> 23:47.991
You owe her an apology.

23:47.991 --> 23:49.515
For the way that I reacted
right now?

23:49.515 --> 23:50.646
- Is that an apology?
- Yes.

23:50.646 --> 23:51.821
Okay. I agree.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.170
- Go figure it out.
- Okay.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.390
In this situation,
I need to diffuse it,

23:55.390 --> 23:58.219
but then you have to step away
and let the leader handle it.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.003
Because if I draw
the line for them,

24:00.003 --> 24:01.483
they'’re never going
to respect each other.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.354
- The vibe'’s just tense.
- Make it.

24:03.354 --> 24:06.009
We'’re only on charter two.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.533
Having said that,
if I hear Natalya

24:07.533 --> 24:10.666
screaming at Tumi again
and Tumi can'’t diffuse it,

24:10.666 --> 24:13.016
then I need to step in
and make a decision.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.543
Oh, my gosh.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.153
She'’s just completely
- ing disgusting.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.328
I wasn'’t, like, trying
to start more drama.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.112
No, it'’s not drama.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.723
It'’s just, like, I've no problem
not being chief stew. None.

24:23.723 --> 24:26.203
But, like, messaging Kyle,
it'’s not on.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.080
It'’s not fair.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.342
I don'’t need this sh--
in my life.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.059
The text message.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.887
My words clearly
had been twisted.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.629
The only text I sent was
her diva behavior,

25:00.629 --> 25:02.457
which will result in me
walking off the boat.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.764
I never said that I have
no problem firing her.

25:04.764 --> 25:05.765
That'’s not my job.
Am I the captain?

25:05.765 --> 25:07.375
How can I fire you?

25:07.375 --> 25:09.725
And I don'’t know if
it'’s her or it's Kyle.

25:09.725 --> 25:10.900
I don'’t know where
this is coming from.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.728
And it'’s frustrating.

25:14.948 --> 25:15.905
Yeah, go ahead, hon.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.472
In hindsight in my position,

25:17.472 --> 25:20.127
it was an unprofessional text,
and that'’s on me.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.824
If I ever vent about anything,

25:21.824 --> 25:23.783
it'’s going to be
talked about, like,

25:23.783 --> 25:25.436
learn from a mistake,

25:25.436 --> 25:30.180
and I think that we can have
a constructive conversation.

25:38.972 --> 25:39.973
No, I have something
perfect for tonight.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.322
It'’s so cute, though.

25:41.322 --> 25:42.889
- I like paisley.
- Somebody'’s listening.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.152
Look at her.
Here we go.

25:45.152 --> 25:49.199
Finally, yes.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.680
Natalya, can we
speak downstairs?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.160
Can we talk downstairs?

25:53.160 --> 25:54.857
I need to... I need to
literally chill for a bit.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.293
I would love to talk with you,
but not right now.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.991
I think the best way
to do this

25:57.991 --> 26:00.428
is I'’ll communicate
through Kyle and vice versa.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.256
Okay.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.823
Don'’t lower yourself.
Don'’t do that.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.695
I know you want to.
Don'’t lower yourself.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.179
We can start packing everything.

26:12.179 --> 26:13.267
Okay, brother.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.485
Is this brother
or is this brother?

26:14.485 --> 26:15.878
Yeah, come,
let'’s pack your stuff.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.358
Yeah, you can take two chairs.

26:17.358 --> 26:19.795
Night job will be the put
all this stuff away.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.367
Okay, come, brother.
Let'’s put this stuff back.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.890
Yes, sister.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.370
Come, we'’re not
lazy on this boat.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.807
- No, we'’re not lazy.
- No, we'’re not lazy.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.419
- Come.
- I'’m waiting for you.

26:45.038 --> 26:45.995
I'’m going to pull for tonight.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.214
- Okay.
- Positive vibes.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.215
Yeah.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.738
Do you have a menu
for tonight?

26:52.785 --> 26:54.395
Yellowtail gousions.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.571
This charter has not gone
as well as I'’d have liked.

26:56.571 --> 26:59.748
So tonight'’s dinner has
to go absolutely perfect.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.187
They make food Caribbean

27:04.187 --> 27:05.580
and just make everything
jerk-flavor.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.930
Big platters, vibrant colors.

27:09.236 --> 27:11.891
Whoa, I'’ve got to be careful
how I say that.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.110
Jerk-flavor.
That'’s it.

27:16.286 --> 27:17.853
Is he packing up the
stuff back there?

27:17.853 --> 27:19.202
I told him too, but he wasn'’t.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.814
And I said, bro,
what the [bleep]? Do something.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.127
And then we'’ve got...

27:33.695 --> 27:35.262
If you go for an hour now,

27:35.262 --> 27:37.699
and then you just come back for
one hour to help us pack up,

27:37.699 --> 27:39.048
and then you'’re
finish for the night.

27:39.048 --> 27:42.225
- Okay.
- Is that all good?

27:43.792 --> 27:48.492
What?
What is your problem?

27:48.492 --> 27:49.972
Just because...

27:53.759 --> 27:54.934
But yesterday you had...

27:54.934 --> 27:56.283
You finished
quite early as well.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.414
Oh, yeah.

27:57.414 --> 28:00.113
Yeah, I knocked
you guys off real early.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.941
With the girls, I can just
tell them to do something.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.420
They'’re going to go do it.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.901
And now I'’ve been tracked
a curveball with Max.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.209
I need to figure out how
to deal with him

28:09.209 --> 28:11.690
and make sure he doesn'’t
up the whole vibe on deck.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.908
So we'’ll just knock him off now?

28:12.908 --> 28:14.170
Yeah, we don'’t need his help.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.737
- Stay down.
- Okay.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.173
- And you start at 3 a.m.
- Okay.

28:17.173 --> 28:20.002
- Well, that was tasty.
- It was. It was so good.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.441
Copy.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.879
I'’m going to go try
to find the guests.

28:28.271 --> 28:29.490
You'’re going to go
to shore now, honey.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.839
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'’m ready.

28:34.887 --> 28:38.238
So I know like
walking in is hard.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.718
Yeah.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.807
And I know when you feel that
pushback, talk it out.

28:41.807 --> 28:45.636
Honestly, it is so difficult to
have a conversation with her.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.464
So when you guys went
downstairs, didn'’t have a chat?

28:47.464 --> 28:49.510
I went down to her and
said, please can we talk?

28:49.510 --> 28:51.773
And she was like,
I don'’t want to talk.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.296
It'’s hard.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.515
Natalya is a great person.

28:54.515 --> 28:55.995
Yeah.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.606
But you need your team
to do their job respectfully.

28:58.606 --> 29:01.609
I do want to apologize for
the way that I reacted.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.611
I am such a calm person

29:03.611 --> 29:06.048
that I'’m actually shocked
that I'’m feeling like this.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.576
I protect myself all the time.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.317
As a kid, eight years old.

29:14.317 --> 29:16.537
I was the lead role
in my ballet concert.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.800
My concert was
literally starting.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.282
And my mom told me my dad
was shot through the...

29:22.282 --> 29:23.979
So he was killed by a bullet.

29:25.415 --> 29:28.027
And I went on stage
and did a two-hour show.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.899
In between my breaks,
I'’d go cry in the bathroom

29:30.899 --> 29:33.336
and then go like put
on a face and dance.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.034
And like I look back
at it now and I'’m like,

29:35.034 --> 29:39.429
I know how to hide that
emotion to do my job.

29:39.429 --> 29:43.694
Fighting people like this.
It'’s unusual for me.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.174
I love what you'’re doing.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.002
I think you'’re doing
an amazing job.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.656
- Keep trying.
- Yeah.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.484
Is Tumi happy with me
taking over the table?

29:50.484 --> 29:52.747
I'’m telling you to
take over, okay?

29:52.747 --> 29:53.922
Hello.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.271
Oh, you did some shopping.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.492
We are headed back
with your guests.

29:58.492 --> 30:01.016
Did you guys miss us
while we were gone?

30:01.016 --> 30:03.279
Of course we did.

30:07.153 --> 30:09.111
Guests are back.
Guests are back.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.029
How was it?

30:27.913 --> 30:30.089
No, it'’s my mom.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.873
So I'’m just going to
print the menu quickly.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.266
And then...

30:33.266 --> 30:34.615
I just wanted to
say I wasn'’t

30:34.615 --> 30:37.400
trying to stir up
anything earlier.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.620
I was just trying to reiterate
what needs to be done

30:39.620 --> 30:42.057
the next time
we go back down there.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.929
But it did and now
I feel really bad.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.060
No, that'’s okay.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.888
There is just a lot right now.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.237
Like trust me, I know.

30:48.237 --> 30:50.892
I'’m starting to
feel bad for Tumi.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.417
I think that Natalya didn'’t
want to hand over that role.

30:54.417 --> 30:58.247
And so she'’s being
a mean girl now.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.901
I was bullied in high school.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.598
It reminds me of all that sh--.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.078
Like she'’s been
stirring sh-- up.

31:03.078 --> 31:04.123
And I don'’t like that.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.515
Thank you, my love.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.821
Deck crew, can we get all
the water toys in?

31:06.821 --> 31:07.822
Yeah.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.911
You got this, hey?

31:09.911 --> 31:11.173
I'’ll send the hook down.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.481
Yay!

31:16.700 --> 31:17.658
Good job, girl.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.268
Yeah, you rocked it.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.930
- All good?
- Yeah.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.758
It'’s beautiful.
Very tropical.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.194
I love this.

31:32.194 --> 31:38.113
<i>Natalya, Natalya, Tumi.
This is very pretty.</i>

31:38.113 --> 31:39.636
All good. Hey, hey.
Good job.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.944
We'’ll all put our blacks on.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.032
Yeah, let'’s do that.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.338
Hey, what you doing?

31:45.338 --> 31:47.340
Wait, who'’s changing for dinner?

31:47.340 --> 31:48.515
I'’m changing for dinner.

31:50.691 --> 31:51.561
She is.

31:51.561 --> 31:52.736
She did the same on our season

31:52.736 --> 31:54.303
with the chief stew and me

31:54.303 --> 31:56.218
- But do we want a mean girl?
- No.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.745
I'’m not warning you because
I'’m saying know your place.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.530
I don'’t give a
about that sh--.

32:03.530 --> 32:06.315
If you don'’t want to die today,
don'’t go down there.

32:07.751 --> 32:08.752
Coming up...

32:08.752 --> 32:10.189
I need you over here, please.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.886
We need the starboard
ground line now.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.975
You need to be clear.
One way in, one way out.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.237
Because now we'’re...

32:15.237 --> 32:16.499
Can you, like, shut up
a little bit?

32:25.856 --> 32:27.641
It smells like
the Caribbean in here.

32:27.641 --> 32:28.990
- Jambalaya.
- Yeah.

32:28.990 --> 32:29.991
For the vegan as well.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.819
- Cheffy?
- Yeah.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.342
I think we'’re just going to go
for dinner for 9 o'’clock, okay?

32:33.342 --> 32:35.605
Yeah.
The later the better.

32:35.605 --> 32:36.563
Okay.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.741
I hate that I let someone
get under my skin so bad.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.785
It really bothers me.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.874
Okay, so the key
is communication.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.703
You sit down, have a chat,
in a non-threatening way.

32:46.703 --> 32:47.748
Yeah.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.358
I want to really
get across to you

32:49.358 --> 32:50.490
that she actually just
didn'’t acknowledge,

32:50.490 --> 32:51.882
everything was nit-picked.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.014
It was just...

32:53.014 --> 32:54.668
Well, that, I want
you to have that.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.061
You guys have that conversation.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.366
- Yeah.
- 100%, sorry.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.412
Thank you.
You guys can figure it out.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.891
I was going
to change for dinner.

33:00.891 --> 33:03.198
- Change into Caribbean.
- No, I'’m sure.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.026
Hey.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.507
- Ah!
- Yes, mama!

33:08.856 --> 33:09.639
Oh!

33:09.639 --> 33:11.032
Looks beautiful out there.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.033
I have a glass of white wine.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.382
- White wine?
- Yeah.

33:13.382 --> 33:16.603
♪ Caribbean queen
Caribbean dream ♪

33:16.603 --> 33:18.779
All right.
Cabins, cabins, cabins.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.350
Did everyone have
a good day today?

33:24.350 --> 33:26.221
Did we kick the day in the dick?

33:26.221 --> 33:27.701
We definitely kicked
today in the dick.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.746
Someone kicked me in
the dick today, so...

33:32.271 --> 33:33.402
Have a seat, guys.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.187
Just thanks for
joining us, ladies.

33:35.187 --> 33:36.797
Thanks for having us.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.755
<i>Deck crew, deck crew. Can you
guys run plates, please?</i>

33:38.755 --> 33:40.801
- Okay, I'’m going to stop.
- Go in if you want.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.933
- I take this to the bar?
- Just take it to the bar.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.414
All righty.

33:45.414 --> 33:48.113
Avo, cajun sauce.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.592
- Smells amazing.
- Smells Caribbean.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.554
- Jerk chicken.
- Beautiful.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.034
This is bringing me back
to the Caribbean.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.687
The bar is set.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.211
- We are real Jamaicans, so...
- Yeah, real Jamaicans, right.

33:59.211 --> 34:02.083
- So this is the vegan...
- Jambalaya.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.432
Thank you very much.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.130
Okay, this is really yummy.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.132
That lobster.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.133
Mm-mm.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.351
And it has a little kick to it.

34:09.351 --> 34:13.616
- Is that the jambalaya?
- Jambalaya.

34:13.616 --> 34:14.922
I'’m not feeling that.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.578
Four.

34:18.578 --> 34:19.796
Let'’s get in the flavor, though.

34:19.796 --> 34:20.710
Thank you.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.799
Yeah, see, we didn'’t get...

34:22.799 --> 34:24.932
We didn'’t nail it with
the new flavors tonight.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.761
We didn'’t.
We missed the mark.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.806
- Very bland.
- Oh, Tumi.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.330
Yes.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.418
You know I don'’t play
about my guests, right, honey?

34:32.418 --> 34:33.854
No, we can fix it.

34:33.854 --> 34:35.551
Super important to me,
it'’s our last night

34:35.551 --> 34:36.683
that everyone'’s happy.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.032
She'’s not really
loving her food.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.468
Okay.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.035
If you could whip
up something fast, maybe?

34:41.035 --> 34:42.471
Everybody else is...

34:42.471 --> 34:44.038
How are we feeling, guys?

34:48.695 --> 34:50.479
Yep. I need something
greasy at this point.

34:50.479 --> 34:51.785
Two more cabins.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.489
Love my job.

35:00.489 --> 35:03.188
So, the vegan isn'’t happy.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.319
Why?

35:04.319 --> 35:07.017
She'’s asking if she can have

35:07.017 --> 35:09.933
just, like, a fried tofu that'’s
seasoned with French fries.

35:09.933 --> 35:12.327
Fried tofu with French fries?
Is that what she said?

35:12.327 --> 35:14.721
She said she wants
something greasy.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.288
Like, I am a lot
of things, yeah.

35:16.288 --> 35:18.464
But vegan is not one of them.

35:20.727 --> 35:21.858
You just feel like
the mark was missed.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.295
Mm-hmm.

35:23.295 --> 35:24.470
I mean, listen, we want them
to cater to all guests.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.732
That'’s important for me.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.517
- No, I just want what I want.
- Ooh!

35:28.517 --> 35:30.084
Okay, thank you so much.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.868
Oh, I just can'’t be
bothered with this.

35:36.917 --> 35:37.918
Okay.

35:37.918 --> 35:38.962
Can we ask Chef
to come upstairs?

35:38.962 --> 35:40.486
- Okay.
- It needs to be breaded.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.618
How do you fry without bread?

35:42.618 --> 35:43.967
<i>- Chef, Chef, Tumi.</i>
- Go ahead.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.491
Guests want you
to come upstairs.

35:45.491 --> 35:46.535
<i>Copy.</i>

35:46.535 --> 35:48.058
All right.
To the master.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.886
Has anyone told you that
your standards are too high?

35:49.886 --> 35:52.367
I'’m a young Black woman
who built my business.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.152
Why should I lower my standards?

35:57.242 --> 35:58.547
- Hi, Chef.
- Hi.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.548
So, listen.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.549
Her tofu, she wanted it fried.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.203
That'’s more of a...

36:02.203 --> 36:03.552
- I did not get told, though.
- Oh, what did Tumi tell me?

36:03.552 --> 36:05.250
- Tumi.
- I was told.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.599
I said fried tofu.

36:06.599 --> 36:07.774
Tumi, you setting us
up for failure here.

36:07.774 --> 36:08.862
- Not breaded.
- Tumi.

36:08.862 --> 36:10.385
I was told fried
is in fried.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.213
- Oh, like pan-seared.
- No, no, no.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.780
Breaded, like deep-fried.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.912
I'’m going to do it for
you now, don'’t worry.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.349
If you don'’t specifically
say to me,

36:17.349 --> 36:19.220
they want deep-fried
breaded tofu,

36:19.220 --> 36:20.526
I'’m not going to do that.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.092
I know I'’m a wizard
in the kitchen,

36:22.092 --> 36:23.224
but I'’m not that magic.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.704
I can'’t read your mind.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.884
People are throwing people under
the bus around you, huh?

36:30.884 --> 36:32.712
It really is.
That'’s what's happening.

36:32.712 --> 36:35.280
I don'’t really understand.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.933
I am emotionally exhausted.

36:36.933 --> 36:40.241
There'’s just tension
in every single corner.

36:40.241 --> 36:42.548
Just when I thought I was
turning corners with the chef,

36:42.548 --> 36:44.550
he just throws me under the bus.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.552
My mom always says,
leave with grace.

36:46.552 --> 36:47.988
And how'’s that going, honey?

36:47.988 --> 36:49.424
Good, fantastic.

36:49.424 --> 36:52.775
- Good night, Bo.
- Good night, honey.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.082
- Tumi, they'’re both ready.
- Thank you so much.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.954
Let me just say,
us Black women period,

36:57.954 --> 37:00.609
when we put our foot down.
Boss sh--.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.220
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.569
See, I told you.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.048
I want a fry.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.441
Here we go.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.051
- How'’s that?
- Much better.

37:08.051 --> 37:08.835
So excited for tomorrow.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.402
Yeah, beyond. I'’m done.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.968
- I'’m going to bed.
- You'’re not going to bed.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.448
- I am.
- But you want to go to bed?

37:13.448 --> 37:14.667
When is our last night?

37:14.667 --> 37:15.972
- Sweet dreams.
- See you tomorrow.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.018
- See you in the morning.
- Bright and early.

37:18.018 --> 37:20.412
Oh, hell to the no.

37:20.412 --> 37:21.456
Thank you so much.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.762
- What time you up?
- 7:30.

37:22.762 --> 37:24.242
All right, everyone go to bed.

37:26.461 --> 37:27.854
Home, sweet home.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.993
All right, well,
that was a very...

37:36.993 --> 37:38.995
Ow, I just stabbed
my finger with a knife.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.867
That was sh--ty.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.304
Um, can we just in the morning?

37:43.304 --> 37:44.958
Yeah.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.135
Okay.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.140
I am shocked things
have gotten this bad.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.448
You know, there'’s no
textbook to this,

37:56.448 --> 37:58.972
but I do know at
this point as chief,

37:58.972 --> 38:01.627
I clearly have to change
something on my part.

38:01.627 --> 38:03.629
And I have to do it now.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.023
Coming up...

38:07.023 --> 38:08.503
You should have come on here,

38:08.503 --> 38:10.244
appreciated the fact
that there was a...

38:10.244 --> 38:11.637
I said thank you.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.029
Personally, I do not want
to be your friend.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.727
Okay, cool.

38:23.562 --> 38:24.867
Oh, no.

38:41.580 --> 38:42.711
Okay.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.804
What are you doing?

38:51.198 --> 38:53.156
Go help Lara on the bow.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.072
Oh, Jesus.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.726
Sandy, everything'’s
good on the stern.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.772
The gates are in,
and the crane'’s home.

38:59.772 --> 39:00.773
Thank you.

39:00.773 --> 39:03.341
- Morning.
- Morning.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.777
Well, what would you guys
like to drink?

39:04.777 --> 39:06.779
I would like a coffee, please.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.607
Okay, Lara. All good?
What'’s up?

39:08.607 --> 39:10.086
Untie this.

39:10.086 --> 39:12.001
- Morning, how are you?
- Good morning.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.960
Tumi, I got two
breakfasts ready.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.267
Girl, we got 90 minutes
of paradise left.

39:17.267 --> 39:18.443
You can start
hauling the anchor.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.966
<i>Copy that.</i>

39:19.966 --> 39:21.533
You'’re going to lie there
and put your head there

39:21.533 --> 39:23.230
and tell me if it'’s
long-stay, short-stay,

39:23.230 --> 39:24.362
and if it comes up.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.233
Oh, [bleep],
I don'’t know. Well...

39:26.233 --> 39:28.017
Max, is it up and down?

39:29.628 --> 39:30.759
Is it home?

39:30.759 --> 39:32.500
- Bravo.
<i>- Anchor, home.</i>

39:32.500 --> 39:34.676
Thank you.
Good job. Thank you.

39:34.676 --> 39:35.938
So, I come here and, like,

39:35.938 --> 39:36.939
one of you guys hug
me good morning

39:36.939 --> 39:38.158
or is it just a thing?

39:38.158 --> 39:39.377
Oh, there we go.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.204
Okeydokey.

39:41.204 --> 39:43.337
So, we'’re going to do exactly
what we did last time.

39:43.337 --> 39:45.687
Grab the ground lines
and then spin around.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.428
Can Lara be up with me forward?

39:47.428 --> 39:49.343
I'’m going to take her
on the stern with me.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.606
It'’s hard up there
with one person.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.434
But we'’ve got both.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.349
Have you done ground lines
and stuff before?

39:55.349 --> 39:56.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.874
Four years in
yachting, man.

39:58.874 --> 40:02.617
With Max, knowing what
I'’ve seen the whole charter,

40:02.617 --> 40:04.140
I just instantly am like,

40:04.140 --> 40:06.142
, this is not
going to go well.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.970
Once the boat'’s in position,

40:07.970 --> 40:09.363
these guys are going to pull
up on the ground lines

40:09.363 --> 40:10.712
and tighten everything up.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.541
Yeah, we'’re moving now.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.675
All right, ladies and gents.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.503
I don'’t need this
sh-- in my life.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.680
I will do exactly what
we did the last time.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.290
Pilot boat,
four meters off.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.814
One meter off.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.512
That is the pilot on board.

40:27.512 --> 40:28.730
We'’re running out of time.

40:28.730 --> 40:29.818
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We'’re docking.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.516
We do got to pack and stuff.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.213
Is you and me in the bow?

40:33.213 --> 40:35.694
Hello.

40:35.694 --> 40:38.087
25 meters to the dock
starboard quarter.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.396
Yeah.

40:45.094 --> 40:47.488
The situation has
gone too far.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.272
This needs to end.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.057
Like, we have to try
and get along.

40:51.057 --> 40:52.711
Maybe I just have
to swallow my pride.

40:52.711 --> 40:56.932
I'’m willing to take
the L for peace.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.239
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:59.239 --> 41:01.284
- You okay to talk?
- Yes.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.503
Okay.

41:02.503 --> 41:05.724
I hate having conflict
in interior team.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.856
One thing I will say about you

41:07.856 --> 41:11.860
is I really respect your,
like, enthusiasm

41:11.860 --> 41:13.514
- and I can see it.
- Thank you.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.950
And that'’s where I feel
like we'’re very similar.

41:14.950 --> 41:16.517
And maybe it'’s just too similar.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.693
- Maybe that'’s just...
- Too right.

41:18.693 --> 41:19.781
It might actually
be the problem.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.435
Yes.

41:21.435 --> 41:24.090
I'’ve worked with so many
different chief stews

41:24.090 --> 41:26.266
that, like, I just took
the things that I liked

41:26.266 --> 41:29.443
and then I shaped it into,
like, how I want to manage.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.662
I came same as you,

41:30.662 --> 41:31.924
straight into this
into a three-day charter

41:31.924 --> 41:33.752
with three stewardesses
in the interior,

41:33.752 --> 41:35.275
one being a greenie.

41:35.275 --> 41:38.060
You should have come on here
appreciated the fact.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.366
I said thank you.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.237
It was more like
a, this is wrong.

41:41.237 --> 41:43.109
And I even said,
if you had listened to me,

41:43.109 --> 41:44.763
actually looked at me in the
face and acknowledged me,

41:44.763 --> 41:46.939
if when you were here, you
wouldn'’t look at me.

41:46.939 --> 41:48.462
At that point, I was...

41:48.462 --> 41:50.377
I was pissed off with the way
that you were speaking.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.596
No, I was.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.249
I'’m going to be dead
honest right now.

41:53.249 --> 41:55.121
You'’ve never given me
a fair go from day one.

41:55.121 --> 41:56.383
You can'’t really say that

41:56.383 --> 41:57.993
because you never gave
me a fair go.

41:57.993 --> 41:59.560
- Hon, I said hello.
- It'’s just the way...

41:59.560 --> 42:00.953
No, your hello was beautiful,

42:00.953 --> 42:02.911
but it'’s just the walk-through
for me

42:02.911 --> 42:03.869
that was just, like, okay, well.

42:03.869 --> 42:05.131
I think you came on here.

42:05.131 --> 42:06.654
You want to obviously
show your place,

42:06.654 --> 42:09.483
which I'’m happy being, and the
fact that you came in...

42:09.483 --> 42:11.137
Natalya, I'’m not, I'm so far
from that person.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.878
- The fact that you came in...
- No, you can'’t.

42:12.878 --> 42:14.836
- ...with not great attitude.
- You can'’t. You can't. Okay.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.359
And I just don'’t...

42:16.359 --> 42:17.796
See, don'’t please
don'’t walk away again

42:17.796 --> 42:18.797
because this is your sort of...

42:18.797 --> 42:20.320
I'’m not walking away.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.583
- Eight minutes from the dock.
- We need more on it.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.367
We need to pull more slack up.

42:24.367 --> 42:26.979
Okay, okay.
You can come here.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.807
No, this sh--...

42:28.807 --> 42:30.112
I need you over here, please.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.984
We need the starboard
ground line now.

42:31.984 --> 42:34.160
They'’re waiting on us.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.596
- Yeah.
- Right back.

42:35.596 --> 42:37.990
Wait, stop. Stop.

42:37.990 --> 42:39.339
Haleigh, Haleigh.

42:39.339 --> 42:40.645
Well, I told you, if you
just listened to me

42:40.645 --> 42:42.168
and did the controls,

42:42.168 --> 42:43.996
it wouldn'’t have been a
- ing madhouse, bro.

42:43.996 --> 42:45.171
You get the starboard
ground line?

42:45.171 --> 42:47.782
What the [bleep] is going on?

42:47.782 --> 42:49.523
Give me a fair go.
Come to the boat.

42:49.523 --> 42:51.177
- I'’ve been giving...
- No, you have not.

42:51.177 --> 42:53.005
When Kyle walks out
of that cabin,

42:53.005 --> 42:54.528
Kyle, have you eaten?

42:54.528 --> 42:56.617
Me. Crickets.

42:56.617 --> 42:57.966
You ignore my presence.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.272
I'’ve never asked him
if he'’s eaten.

42:59.272 --> 43:00.621
I'’m running around like
a headless chicken.

43:00.621 --> 43:01.883
Do you know what my
chief stews taught me?

43:01.883 --> 43:03.319
Not to leave wine bottles

43:03.319 --> 43:04.364
just sitting overnight
on the counters.

43:04.364 --> 43:06.409
You'’re supposed to be my boss.

43:06.409 --> 43:08.020
So, with that, if you
want me to do a day head,

43:08.020 --> 43:09.325
I will do the day head.

43:09.325 --> 43:10.979
Want me in cabins,
I'’m in cabins.

43:10.979 --> 43:12.981
If you want me to be
anywhere, I'’m anywhere.

43:12.981 --> 43:14.635
Personally, I do not want
to be your friend

43:14.635 --> 43:16.028
and I don'’t care...

43:16.028 --> 43:17.420
because I think it'’s
all fake bullsh--.

43:17.420 --> 43:19.379
But I would happily
love to work with you.

43:19.379 --> 43:23.557
Um, and that'’s it.
Communication'’s great.

43:23.557 --> 43:24.819
With the...
You want me in housekeeping?

43:24.819 --> 43:25.820
I will go anywhere.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.082
Okay.

43:27.082 --> 43:28.649
I don'’t want
to friendship with you.

43:28.649 --> 43:30.346
Okay, we'’re all good and
nicely secure on the stern.

43:30.346 --> 43:31.696
How are you doing
up forward, Haleigh?

43:31.696 --> 43:33.349
We'’re still pulling up.

43:33.349 --> 43:36.004
You need to be clear.
One way in, one way out.

43:36.004 --> 43:37.397
Can you shut up a little bit?

43:37.397 --> 43:39.181
Just a little bit
while we do this.

43:39.181 --> 43:40.705
This is not good.

43:40.705 --> 43:42.184
Oh, hell no.

43:42.184 --> 43:43.577
First charter with a full team.

43:43.577 --> 43:45.448
Everything should be
easier to operate.

43:45.448 --> 43:47.581
Clearly, that'’s not the case.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.714
You need to add
the port ground line.

43:49.714 --> 43:51.585
Don'’t tell me to shut up.

43:51.585 --> 43:53.239
You can talk as much
as you want later.

43:53.239 --> 43:54.849
If you do things wrong,
I have to tell you.

43:54.849 --> 43:56.677
I just want to see
a successful charter

43:56.677 --> 43:57.896
because we'’re both here to
make, obviously, great tips.

43:57.896 --> 43:59.245
Okay, cool.

43:59.245 --> 44:01.029
ing little bitch.
