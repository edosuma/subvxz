WEBVTT

00:07.941 --> 00:10.377
Oh, don't you look nice?

00:10.377 --> 00:11.911
Yeah, Frasier
wanted me dressed up

00:11.911 --> 00:14.447
for this mystery lunch
of his.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.449
He hasn't told you what
the occasion is, either?

00:16.449 --> 00:18.952
No, but I'm sure
it's something very important.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.453
I'm sure he
wants to unveil

00:20.453 --> 00:23.957
his new antique
Elizabethan egg timer.

00:23.957 --> 00:27.460
Yeah, or debut
his Precolumbian spoon rest.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.863
Hello, all.
MARTIN: Hey.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.931
Well, Dad,
I see you're ready to roll.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.433
Yeah. Can you
at least tell us

00:33.433 --> 00:35.702
what kind of restaurant
you're taking us to?

00:35.702 --> 00:36.536
Patience, Dad.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.538
Roz'll be here in a few minutes,

00:38.538 --> 00:41.307
then we'll be off
and all will be revealed.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.076
So, how did it go
with the doctor?

00:43.076 --> 00:44.544
Judging by that smile
on your face,

00:44.544 --> 00:46.046
I'm guessing
your cholesterol's down.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.547
Well, after several weeks

00:47.547 --> 00:49.549
of watching my diet
and taking my medication

00:49.549 --> 00:52.485
and racewalking every Tuesday,
it hasn't budged.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.987
The good news is, though,

00:53.987 --> 00:56.890
that I've developed bursitis
to help take my mind off of it.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.794
The doctor says it's all
just a matter of aging.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.762
Well, no reason to let it
ruin our festive lunch.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.297
Yeah... Boy,
you don't forget

01:04.798 --> 01:06.266
that trip to the
doctor, do you?

01:06.266 --> 01:08.735
That day he says, "There's
nothing I can do for you.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.204
You're just getting old, sport."

01:11.204 --> 01:14.140
In my case, it was "slugger,"
but that was the gist.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.141
You know what I realize?

01:15.642 --> 01:17.010
When people reach
our stage of life...

01:17.010 --> 01:18.311
Dad, please,
with all due respect,

01:18.311 --> 01:19.379
when it comes
to life's journeys,

01:19.379 --> 01:21.381
you and I do not share a stage.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.351
We're not even
in the same theater.

01:25.351 --> 01:28.054
You're taking this all
very cheerfully, Dr. Crane.

01:28.054 --> 01:28.788
(doorbell rings)

01:28.788 --> 01:30.123
Well, why shouldn't I?

01:30.123 --> 01:32.392
In many ways,
my life couldn't be better.

01:32.392 --> 01:33.259
I mean, by and large,

01:33.259 --> 01:34.928
I'm in good health.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.764
There's a promising new
relationship on the horizon--

01:37.764 --> 01:39.265
the lovely Rachel.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.267
My career is thriving.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.769
Did you say "thriving"
or "diving"?

01:42.769 --> 01:43.636
What?

01:43.636 --> 01:46.005
Look at these ratings.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.507
Oh, Roz, that's nothing
to worry about.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.375
For God's sakes,
they're just leveling off.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.611
Yeah, that's what tends
to happen when you hit bottom.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.513
There's no cause
for alarm here, Roz.

01:53.513 --> 01:56.883
The important thing is that
we go on doing a quality show.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.651
Hey, how about
some quality lunch?

01:58.651 --> 01:59.919
Splendid idea, Dad.
Off we go, then.

01:59.919 --> 02:01.921
Oh, uh, Niles will be
joining us there.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.389
(cell phone rings)

02:03.389 --> 02:04.390
Excuse me.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.658
Hello?

02:05.658 --> 02:09.963
Ah, Rachel, yes, uh...

02:09.963 --> 02:11.464
momentito.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.467
So, is Donny going
to be joining us?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.469
No, he's got wedding business
this afternoon.

02:16.970 --> 02:17.971
He's composing our vows.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.372
Oh, isn't that romantic?

02:19.372 --> 02:22.308
He's not exactly Wordsworth
strolling through a shady glen.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.311
When I left, he was lying
on the couch in his underwear

02:25.311 --> 02:26.813
with a tin of Vienna sausages

02:26.813 --> 02:28.581
and a rhyming dictionary
on his chest.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.418
Remember that new promising
relationship on the horizon?

02:32.418 --> 02:33.353
Yeah.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.721
It just got married
in Vegas last night.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.456
(groans)

02:38.191 --> 02:40.326
Great, then you don't have a
date for Daphne's wedding?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.562
Oh, I'll find a date,
don't worry, Roz. Lunch awaits.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.264
Hey, great.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.565
Why don't we
go together?

02:45.565 --> 02:46.566
No, Roz, I assure you.

02:46.566 --> 02:47.567
My dance card
will be punched.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.068
By who?

02:49.068 --> 02:50.069
Well, I don't know
right now.

02:50.069 --> 02:52.071
It's just that I will be
"Crane plus one."

02:52.071 --> 02:53.039
Uh-huh.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.008
Just in case
you don't get a date,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.009
what time would you pick me up?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.010
I'm getting a date.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.511
Well, just in case.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.512
I'm getting a date.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.513
What time are you
picking her up?

03:00.513 --> 03:01.514
3:00.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.515
Can you make it 3:30?

03:02.515 --> 03:03.483
I'm getting a date!

03:07.987 --> 03:09.489
(indistinct chatter)

03:09.489 --> 03:11.558
DAPHNE:
So, what's the big occasion?

03:11.558 --> 03:12.992
Wait for it, Daphne,
let the moment build.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.060
Besides, Niles
hasn't arrived yet.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.528
I'd be surprised
if he came.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.563
He's terrified
of this place.

03:16.563 --> 03:17.830
Still?

03:17.830 --> 03:19.899
My God, it's been 30 years.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.067
What happened?

03:21.067 --> 03:22.402
Oh, Esther and I
brought the boys here

03:22.402 --> 03:24.404
when they were kids, and
Niles was running around,

03:24.404 --> 03:25.905
and he bumped into
the dessert trolley,

03:26.406 --> 03:27.907
and Stefano got hot
and yelled at him,

03:27.907 --> 03:30.210
and Niles got terrified
and he... well...

03:30.210 --> 03:30.910
He vomited.

03:30.910 --> 03:31.711
Right.

03:33.012 --> 03:34.347
All over Stefano's shoes.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.349
Then he ran out,
hid behind the car,

03:36.349 --> 03:38.184
and he hasn't been
back in here since.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.485
Poor little weenie.

03:40.687 --> 03:41.988
Hey, Dr. Crane!

03:41.988 --> 03:44.490
Buon giorno, buon giorno,
buon giorno!

03:44.490 --> 03:46.492
Oh, good to see you,
Stefano. How are you?

03:46.492 --> 03:48.494
Allow me to introduce
you to Daphne Moon...

03:48.494 --> 03:49.495
STEFANO:
Yes, yes.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.464
And my father, Martin,
you remember, of course.

03:51.464 --> 03:52.832
Yes, hi, how are you?
This is...

03:52.832 --> 03:54.500
Hey, we all know Roz.

03:55.735 --> 03:56.769
All right.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.771
For today, we've got
some special dishes.

03:58.771 --> 03:59.739
For you, Dr. Crane--

03:59.739 --> 04:01.574
porcini,
fresh from Napoli.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.442
Oh.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.277
And for me?

04:04.277 --> 04:06.946
Giorgio, fresh from Sicily.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.781
Can I get him to go?

04:08.781 --> 04:10.149
You bet.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.652
Okay, now, I'm going to be
waiting on you myself today.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.654
You just give me a minute,
I come back.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.154
Grazie.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.658
(cell phone ringing)

04:18.658 --> 04:20.159
Excuse me.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.096
Hello?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.498
Yes, hello, Niles.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.367
Oh, really?

04:27.367 --> 04:29.636
Oh, what a shame.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.337
Told ya.
No, that's all right.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.739
If your patient
is having a crisis,

04:32.739 --> 04:33.740
you'd better address it...

04:33.740 --> 04:34.741
before it turns into

04:34.741 --> 04:38.745
a crippling, immature,
lifelong problem!

04:40.179 --> 04:42.181
You're not really
mad at him, are you?

04:42.181 --> 04:43.616
Well, of course,
I'm mad at him.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.018
I'm certainly
going to give him

04:45.018 --> 04:46.586
a piece of my mind
at dinner tonight.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.587
Tonight?

04:47.587 --> 04:50.456
Oh, I was hoping you could come
to Alice's birthday party.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.824
My balloon animal guy canceled,

04:51.824 --> 04:53.826
and I could really
use your help.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.828
I'm sorry, Niles made
the reservations a month ago.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.096
It's at Quelque Chose.

04:57.096 --> 04:58.998
Fine.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.300
Listen, if Niles
isn't coming,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.402
maybe you can tell us
what the big surprise is.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.104
Oh, all right,
I'll spill.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.907
For over 60 years,
Stefano's has immortalized

05:07.907 --> 05:10.343
Seattle's famous faces
on its walls,

05:10.343 --> 05:12.078
as you can see.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.881
With one notable exception.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.817
It's me!

05:17.817 --> 05:19.652
Stefano's unveiling
the portrait today.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.321
Oh, how wonderful.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.623
Hey, that's what I'll do
for Alice's party--

05:23.623 --> 05:25.892
I'll get a cartoonist
to draw the kids.

05:25.892 --> 05:26.659
That's an excellent idea, Roz,

05:26.659 --> 05:28.161
but let's not forget
why we're here.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.162
Does anybody have a toast?

05:29.162 --> 05:32.165
Okay, Dr. Crane,
here it is.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.166
My portrait?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.667
No, it's today's specials.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.169
Of course,
it's your portrait.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.104
Would you like to say
a few words or something?

05:38.104 --> 05:40.540
Well, uh, if you insist.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.514
Before we unveil
this picture,

05:48.514 --> 05:50.950
permit me to paint
one of my own.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.419
A picture
of a young Frasier Crane,

05:53.419 --> 05:57.924
wide-eyed, gazing at the walls
of Stefano's and wondering...

05:57.924 --> 05:59.926
"Who's that?"

05:59.926 --> 06:03.930
Well, little did I suspect
that one day my picture

06:03.930 --> 06:06.432
would be on the wall,
and perhaps now

06:06.432 --> 06:10.436
other children will come in,
gaze at it, and wonder...

06:10.436 --> 06:12.205
"Who's that?"

06:12.205 --> 06:14.507
I'm betting that's
going to happen a lot.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.578
So, thank you, Stefano,
for this honor.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.580
Thank you
for suggesting it.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.150
And now...

06:24.150 --> 06:27.487
may I present Il Dottore!

06:27.487 --> 06:29.522
Dr. Frasier Crane!

06:29.522 --> 06:31.491
(gasping)

06:39.565 --> 06:41.067
Fras, will you let it go?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.635
It's a perfectly
nice picture.

06:42.635 --> 06:43.569
Oh?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.005
So, nothing about it
jumped out at you

06:46.472 --> 06:48.508
as, oh, I don't know...
encephalitic?

06:49.842 --> 06:51.644
So they gave you a big
forehead. Who cares?

06:51.644 --> 06:52.945
It makes you look smart.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.614
It makes me look
like I discovered fire.

06:56.015 --> 06:58.084
Frasier, I was just
leaving you a note

06:58.084 --> 06:59.585
apologizing for
that flimsy excuse.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.587
I'm sorry, just the thought
of going back to that place

07:01.587 --> 07:03.089
got my stomach
doing flip-flops.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.057
Yeah, yeah.
Come on in, Niles.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.661
Oh, by the way, Daphne,

07:08.661 --> 07:10.463
the doorman gave me this.
It's for you.

07:10.463 --> 07:11.697
No, it's for Donny.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.634
No, it's for
"Mrs. Donny Douglas."

07:14.634 --> 07:17.837
Oh, funny, that's the first time
I've seen my name like that.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.172
Well, get used to it.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.007
That's you
in a couple of weeks.

07:21.007 --> 07:21.841
So, how was lunch?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.042
What was
the surprise?

07:23.042 --> 07:23.876
Don't ask.

07:23.876 --> 07:25.211
The less said, the better.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.579
They put his picture
on the wall,

07:26.579 --> 07:28.881
and he thinks his forehead
looks a touch too big.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.983
A touch?!

07:30.983 --> 07:33.753
I look like a fugitive
from Easter Island.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.090
Frasier,

07:38.090 --> 07:40.193
you always think
you look bad in pictures.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.028
Niles, this is not some photo
I can just throw away.

07:42.028 --> 07:45.031
This is a picture of me
in a famous restaurant.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.333
God, I dreamed my entire life
of being on that wall.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.100
And now you are.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.369
Are you really so vain
that that's not honor enough?

07:50.369 --> 07:51.671
Vanity has nothing
to do with it.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.172
It's about misrepresentation.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.174
And you know, if I were you,
I would be careful

07:55.174 --> 07:57.677
about bandying about
the word "vain,"

07:57.677 --> 08:00.112
Mr. $250 Haircut!

08:01.314 --> 08:03.950
I have problem follicles.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.489
Frasier,
it's a caricature.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.324
They exaggerate stuff.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.658
Now, if it were me,

08:12.658 --> 08:14.527
they would have drawn
maybe a big cane.

08:14.527 --> 08:15.661
If it were Niles,

08:15.661 --> 08:16.395
they'd draw a barber

08:16.395 --> 08:18.965
cutting the hair
off a giant sucker.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.372
I know you're sensitive
about your big forehead,

08:26.372 --> 08:28.541
but we all have
stuff like that.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.809
With me, it's my eyes.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.744
I've always fancied
sparkling blue ones

08:32.311 --> 08:33.645
instead of dull old brown.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.014
Your eyes?

08:35.014 --> 08:36.515
Your eyes are not dull.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.784
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
That's very nice.

08:38.784 --> 08:42.587
They're... they're...
warm and, uh...

08:44.590 --> 08:46.592
...full of life.

08:46.592 --> 08:49.095
You have beautiful
eyes, too.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.033
Oh, goodness.

08:54.033 --> 08:58.037
I can't be lollygagging
around here, I have to...

08:58.037 --> 09:00.006
to get Dr. Crane his oat bran.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.841
Oat bran? Now?

09:01.841 --> 09:03.209
You'll need it for the morning.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.211
You've got to have
something to sop up

09:05.211 --> 09:07.179
all that nasty cholesterol
gumming up your heart.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.148
If not, I'm liable to come home

09:09.148 --> 09:10.650
and find you face down
on the floor

09:10.650 --> 09:12.652
with the dog
gnawing off your foot,

09:12.652 --> 09:15.154
and I'm not making that up,
either. That happened.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.389
Cheerio.

09:18.457 --> 09:21.627
I wish she'd move that fast
when I'm out of beer.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.563
Well, I should be off, too.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.565
Are we still on
for dinner at Quelque Chose?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.066
Oh, yes, yes,
of course, Niles.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.501
You might want to call
and confirm.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.735
Yes, I'll make a mental note.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.037
Well, be careful
you don't lose it

09:31.037 --> 09:33.539
inside that giant
puppet head of yours.

09:33.539 --> 09:34.840
Good-bye, Niles!

09:36.943 --> 09:39.145
Giant puppet head, indeed.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.513
Oh, let it go, Frasier--
what are you going to do,

09:40.513 --> 09:42.348
go down there
and make him change it?

09:42.348 --> 09:44.617
Just accept it
for the honor it is,

09:44.617 --> 09:46.085
that's all.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.086
You know,
I don't get you.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.622
A doctor gives you bad news,
you take it in stride

09:49.622 --> 09:50.623
but one bad picture...

09:50.623 --> 09:51.624
Yes, thank you, Dad.

09:51.624 --> 09:52.592
Hello.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.561
Yes, I'm calling
about a reservation tonight.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.997
For two. Crane.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.565
Well, what can I say,

09:59.565 --> 10:02.501
but I just love
your food, Stefano.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.340
I'm in the mood
for Italian.

10:11.911 --> 10:14.246
Will you come along, Niles?

10:14.246 --> 10:15.047
I'd really
rather not.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.049
I'm feeling queasy
just standing here.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.051
You can hardly see
the picture from there.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.553
All right, let's just
be quick about this.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.555
Hello, do you have
a reservation?

10:22.555 --> 10:24.557
Uh, yes. For Crane.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.558
One moment.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.959
You tricked me.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.327
We'll just be here long enough

10:28.327 --> 10:29.328
for me to talk to Stefano,

10:29.328 --> 10:30.830
convince him to change
the picture

10:30.830 --> 10:33.232
so it doesn't mock me
for the rest of my life.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.634
Frasier, the man
has a violent temper.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.601
He's already made me
humiliate myself once.

10:35.601 --> 10:36.569
Niles, I can't believe

10:36.569 --> 10:38.571
you're letting a minor
childhood trauma

10:38.571 --> 10:39.572
like this plague you.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.073
I have a feeling this may be

10:41.073 --> 10:42.541
the root of your fear
of authority figures.

10:42.541 --> 10:43.976
Listen, a nice,
relaxing

10:43.976 --> 10:45.444
dinner here may
go a long way

10:45.444 --> 10:46.946
toward helping you
resolve this problem.

10:47.446 --> 10:48.314
Dottore,

10:48.314 --> 10:50.216
Dottore, how nice
 to see you again.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.218
Stefano, good to see you.

10:52.718 --> 10:53.686
And who is
this gentleman?

10:53.686 --> 10:54.654
He looks
familiar to me.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.122
This is my
brother, Niles.

10:56.122 --> 10:58.124
Of course, you have
the family forehead.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.058
Come on.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.461
Follow me.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.296
Hey, Antonio, slow down!

11:04.296 --> 11:05.598
(yelling in Italian)

11:05.598 --> 11:07.933
What's the
matter with you?

11:07.933 --> 11:09.568
Come on

11:09.568 --> 11:10.903
sit down, we got
a nice table.

11:10.903 --> 11:11.904
Oh, thank you.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.406
Right under
your picture.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.741
Okay, tonight,
no menus.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.610
I'm going to take care
of everything.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.445
Except the bill, of course.

11:19.445 --> 11:20.880
(laughs)

11:24.784 --> 11:28.254
Well, there it is.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.289
Frasier Cranium.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.296
Well, it does have
a certain under-nuanced

11:37.296 --> 11:39.298
over-contoured...

11:39.298 --> 11:41.167
Macy's parade
kind of quality, but...

11:41.167 --> 11:43.035
even so, you cannot

11:43.035 --> 11:43.969
ask him to change it.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.271
The man will explode.

11:45.271 --> 11:48.074
Not if I do it
with the utmost tact.

11:48.074 --> 11:48.908
Okay...

11:48.908 --> 11:51.277
here we are,
antipasto.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.678
Oh...
Oh...

11:52.678 --> 11:53.546
Wonderful, Stefano.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.581
You know, you certainly
do have a way

11:55.581 --> 11:56.882
of making people
feel comfortable.

11:56.882 --> 12:01.153
I suspect that it would
actually physically pain you

12:01.153 --> 12:04.957
to think that someone
wasn't totally pleased.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.559
What's wrong?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.393
Mm-mmm.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.895
Well, actually...
well, there is a...

12:09.895 --> 12:11.764
a tiny, tiny problem.

12:11.764 --> 12:12.998
It's really about

12:12.998 --> 12:14.867
my picture, you see.

12:14.867 --> 12:18.204
There is a small faction

12:18.204 --> 12:21.340
that thinks the forehead
is too large.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.141
What, this one?

12:22.141 --> 12:24.543
No, I love it.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.548
As do I.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.050
It's just that, well, I...

12:31.550 --> 12:33.052
I feel I might be
more recognizable

12:33.552 --> 12:37.022
if the forehead
were a tad smaller.

12:37.022 --> 12:37.990
So you don't like it?

12:37.990 --> 12:38.858
It's not that.

12:38.858 --> 12:39.625
It's not good enough for you?

12:39.625 --> 12:40.326
Yes, it is.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.393
You want me to have it changed?

12:41.393 --> 12:42.161
Could you?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.634
How long is this
going to take?

12:48.634 --> 12:50.169
Now, Niles, I was
fortunate enough

12:50.169 --> 12:51.670
that the artist is
actually here tonight.

12:51.670 --> 12:52.671
I'm certainly not
going to rush him.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.174
Now, you better
finish your lasagna.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.175
You don't want
to offend Stefano.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.543
Offend him?

12:57.543 --> 13:00.446
So far tonight I have had
the prosciutto di Parma,

13:00.446 --> 13:02.948
the pesto Genovese
and the Venetian sea bass.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.450
One more bite,
and we'll conclude

13:04.450 --> 13:07.453
our little tour of Italy
with my impression of Pompeii.

13:08.821 --> 13:12.158
Hey, hey,
look who it is.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.627
They'll let anyone
in this joint.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.595
Hello, Kenny.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.063
So what are you celebrating?

13:18.063 --> 13:18.898
Not your ratings, huh?

13:18.898 --> 13:20.199
I'm kidding!

13:20.199 --> 13:21.700
You got to kid.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.603
If you don't laugh,
you cry, right?

13:24.603 --> 13:26.005
So, did I hear a rumor

13:26.005 --> 13:28.274
you're going up
on the wall of fame? Oh, yes.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.041
As a matter of fact,
they're putting

13:29.542 --> 13:30.476
the finishing touches
on the picture right now.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.378
Isn't that
something?

13:32.378 --> 13:33.879
Hey, hey, hey, you
better save some room.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.381
Stefano goes crazy

13:35.381 --> 13:36.816
if you pass
on his dessert.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.250
My mother found that out
the hard way

13:38.751 --> 13:40.252
on her 80th birthday.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.087
He went off on her.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.823
Called her a...

13:43.823 --> 13:46.759
skoonja-boonja or something.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.061
The kids had it memorized
for a while.

13:49.061 --> 13:51.330
Well, enjoy.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.131
STEFANO:
Okay, Dr. Crane.

13:52.131 --> 13:54.533
Hot off the easel.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.035
Is this one more
to your liking?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.036
Oh, my.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.037
Is it better?

13:58.037 --> 14:00.539
Well, it's like
looking in a mirror.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.341
Okay, that's what
I want to hear.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.543
You know, this is the first time

14:04.543 --> 14:07.613
that anybody's ever
asked for a change.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.114
Beautiful.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.616
You make me so happy.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.051
I'm going to see how
the steaks are coming.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.118
Thank you.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.623
Frasier, I hate
to burst your bubble,

14:17.623 --> 14:21.660
but that picture looks
absolutely nothing like you.

14:21.660 --> 14:22.628
Well, well...

14:22.628 --> 14:27.433
I was wondering when Mr. Envy
would pull up a chair.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.302
Ah, Kenny, Kenny.

14:30.302 --> 14:33.305
If I may, can I direct your
attention to this caricature?

14:33.305 --> 14:35.307
Wow, look at that.
I am impressed.

14:35.307 --> 14:36.242
I thought you might be.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.544
James Garner eats here?

14:39.345 --> 14:41.080
James Garner?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.381
Well, I guess
I can go sit down now.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.850
My father-in-law
just picked up the check.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.386
I don't believe this.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.387
I've waited
my entire life

14:48.888 --> 14:49.889
to have my picture
on this wall.

14:50.356 --> 14:51.790
Now that it is,
it's unrecognizable.

14:51.790 --> 14:52.725
Well, not for long.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.093
No. Frasier,
you are not

14:54.093 --> 14:55.794
going to ask him
to change it again.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.396
Niles... if this means
so much to you,

14:57.396 --> 14:58.597
my girlfriend
is a plastic surgeon.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.132
She can have you looking
like this picture

15:00.132 --> 15:02.167
in six procedures or less.

15:02.167 --> 15:02.968
All right,

15:02.968 --> 15:05.304
here we are, boys, here we are.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.805
Mangia bene.

15:06.805 --> 15:09.308
Whoa!

15:09.308 --> 15:10.309
Thank you. Grazie.

15:10.309 --> 15:11.810
You know, there's
been something

15:11.810 --> 15:14.280
that's been bugging
me all night.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.481
Hey, shove over, will you?

15:18.284 --> 15:19.785
I know you
from someplace,

15:19.785 --> 15:21.287
and I can't
figure out where.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.656
And it's driving me
pazzo.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.991
So, we got to figure
this out together, okay?

15:25.991 --> 15:27.459
You and me, all right?

15:27.459 --> 15:29.428
You know,
while you two

15:29.428 --> 15:30.396
are strolling down
memory lane,

15:30.396 --> 15:32.398
I have a quick errand
I have to run.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.399
I tell you what.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.400
Save some dessert
for me.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.401
Frasier, Frasier...

15:40.339 --> 15:41.140
Uh, Roz...

15:41.140 --> 15:43.609
Frasier, I knew you'd show up.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.610
Yes, well, of course.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.612
You knew how much it would
mean to me and Alice.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.013
Oh, gosh, am I
that transparent?

15:48.013 --> 15:48.847
Come on in.

15:48.847 --> 15:50.349
Everybody, this is Frasier.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.917
Hello, hello. Hi.

15:51.917 --> 15:52.785
Can I get you something?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.154
Jell-O? Lunchables?

15:55.154 --> 15:56.121
Pokemon punch?

15:56.121 --> 15:57.823
Do you have any coffee made?

15:57.823 --> 15:58.624
No.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.959
That's perfect.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.294
I mean, while you're making
coffee, it'll give me some

16:02.294 --> 16:04.196
quality time
with Alice.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.038
Hey, no cuts.
I need

16:13.038 --> 16:14.139
a picture right away.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.808
I'll tell. Do you know
who this is?

16:15.808 --> 16:16.675
This is the birthday girl.

16:16.675 --> 16:17.676
If she wants a picture
right away,

16:18.177 --> 16:19.144
she's gonna get a picture
right away.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.079
Now why don't you run along?

16:22.948 --> 16:24.450
All right, I think
you're finished.

16:24.950 --> 16:25.784
Here we are.

16:25.784 --> 16:27.586
But I don't have any eyes.

16:27.586 --> 16:28.854
Yes, well,

16:28.854 --> 16:30.122
neither did
Little Orphan Annie

16:30.122 --> 16:32.124
and she's got her own
Broadway show. Now, go on, shoo.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.993
Okay, fine.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.361
I'm looking for something manly.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.363
Go easy on the forehead
and leave the kid out.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.074

16:47.940 --> 16:48.941
Niles.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.378
Where the hell
have you been?

16:52.378 --> 16:53.379
Stefano's been
trying to place me

16:53.879 --> 16:54.880
for the last 40 minutes.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.382
Was I ever in Panama?

16:56.382 --> 16:58.384
Did I sell him
his first Lincoln?

16:58.384 --> 17:01.153
Do I have a box
at the dog track?

17:01.153 --> 17:02.488
Why don't you
just say "yes"

17:02.488 --> 17:03.956
and let that be
the end of it?

17:03.956 --> 17:06.290
Oh, that's a good idea.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.194
What's that?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.195
I went by Alice's
birthday party.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.132
I had the artist there
draw me some new sketches.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.532
Here. What do you think?

17:14.532 --> 17:16.568
(gasps):
I think you're insane.

17:16.568 --> 17:17.836
No, Niles,

17:17.836 --> 17:19.605
it's not so crazy,
really, just imagine.

17:19.605 --> 17:20.939
Suppose that picture there

17:20.939 --> 17:24.175
should accidentally
drop to the floor

17:24.175 --> 17:25.577
and tear.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.079
You see, I could come
back here tomorrow

17:27.079 --> 17:28.580
tell Stefano
that I didn't want

17:28.580 --> 17:30.015
to put his artist
to any more trouble

17:30.015 --> 17:31.917
and I had a new
caricature done myself.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.952
You see, I'm actually
partial to this one here.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.954
But there is one in here
of me playing soccer

17:35.954 --> 17:38.424
which is very good.

17:38.424 --> 17:39.458
Frasier...

17:39.458 --> 17:40.859
we'll put these away,
and we'll pay the bill

17:40.859 --> 17:42.861
and we'll find a bed
to strap you into.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.363
No, no, no, Niles.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.364
This can work. It really can.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.366
I promise you,
it can work.

17:47.366 --> 17:50.102
What is this?
The pictures?

17:50.102 --> 17:52.337
It's nothing, it's no business
of yours. Off you go.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.274
Stefano.
Shh.

17:55.274 --> 17:56.275
Stefano!

17:56.275 --> 17:58.043
Mama, what is it?

17:58.043 --> 18:00.212
(speaks Italian)

18:00.212 --> 18:01.480
Dr. Crane,
what is this?

18:02.881 --> 18:04.383
Oh, all right.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.351
I may as well just
tell you the truth.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.688
The fact is, I don't really
care for this picture, either.

18:09.688 --> 18:11.423
It's just that
I'm afraid

18:11.423 --> 18:12.791
your artist has
lost his touch.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.793
To be honest, I think
he's robbing you blind.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.129
I mean, my God, how much
is this hack charging you?

18:17.129 --> 18:18.464
(cries)

18:18.464 --> 18:19.465
Mama, Mama.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.670
Mama's the hack, isn't she?

18:24.670 --> 18:26.672
That's right.
(yelling in Italian)

18:26.672 --> 18:29.174
Son of a gun,
get out of here!

18:29.174 --> 18:30.676
And don't ever
come back!

18:30.676 --> 18:32.678
(yells in Italian)

18:35.180 --> 18:36.982
You, hold on one second.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.283
Now... I remember you.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.751
Oh...

18:39.751 --> 18:42.154
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.056
Yes. Yes.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.357
Right.
Yes.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.626
My car got stuck in the rain
and you saved my ass.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.994
Yes, well, it was nothing.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.796
Glad you remembered.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.965
Let me show you how we
thank you where I come from.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.839
Well, suffice it to say,

19:00.839 --> 19:02.407
that the entire
Crane family

19:02.908 --> 19:03.876
is now banned
from Stefano's.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.310
Just 'cause of
that dumb picture?

19:05.310 --> 19:06.745
No, no, actually

19:06.745 --> 19:08.747
there was a little incident
involving Niles, too.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.383
He was doing just fine

19:11.383 --> 19:13.385
until Stefano took him
in some sort of a bear hug

19:13.385 --> 19:15.888
and shook him
a little too vigorously.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.024
On the shoes again?

19:19.024 --> 19:20.325
No, this time there was

19:20.325 --> 19:23.262
a conveniently placed
lobster tank.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.430
Poor Niles.
Yeah.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.699
Wasn't any picnic
for the lobsters either.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.637
What the hell is wrong
with me, Dad?

19:31.637 --> 19:33.672
I became so obsessed
with that damn picture

19:33.672 --> 19:35.040
I completely lost my head.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.310
Well, I think I know
what's really going on here.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.711
Really?

19:39.711 --> 19:41.146
Well, enlighten us.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.549
Well, I think there's
some stuff in your life

19:43.549 --> 19:44.883
that you can't control.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.585
Your doctor tells you
you're getting old.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.986
Your ratings are low.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.988
You're not happy
with your love life.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.491
And so I think you obsessed
about this picture

19:52.491 --> 19:54.993
because you figured it was
something in your life

19:54.993 --> 19:56.395
that you could control.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.405
Well, Dad, you do raise a point.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.675
Oh, what the hell,
you're dead on.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.543
Where'd you learn so much
about psychology?

20:11.543 --> 20:15.247
Oh, I listen to radio.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.582
Gosh, it's so obvious, isn't it?

20:16.582 --> 20:18.083
You know, when a person
is confronted

20:18.083 --> 20:20.085
with some deeply troubling issue

20:20.085 --> 20:21.587
that they're not
ready to face yet

20:21.587 --> 20:22.588
they usually avoid the problem

20:23.088 --> 20:24.590
by obsessing
about something else--

20:24.590 --> 20:25.591
something completely trivial.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.359
Got it.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.126
Got what?

20:28.126 --> 20:29.561
Dr. Crane's oat bran.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.930
God, you left for that
eight hours ago.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.298
Well, it wasn't easy.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.334
They were out of it
at the regular market

20:35.334 --> 20:36.335
so I went
to another one.

20:36.835 --> 20:37.769
But they
were out of it

20:37.769 --> 20:39.137
so I looked into it

20:39.137 --> 20:39.938
and it turns out

20:40.439 --> 20:41.940
they don't sell it
in Washington anymore.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.443
Well, for some reason,
I just couldn't let it go.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.245
So I went for a little drive.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.847
It wouldn't kill you to do
something like that once in a while.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.649
Get off that big, round
duff of yours.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.653
Anyway... hop, skip
and a jump later...

20:55.153 --> 20:56.121
here it is.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.656
Fresh from Portland.

20:59.157 --> 21:00.158
Well, off to bed.

21:00.158 --> 21:01.460
Good night.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.096
What the hell was that?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.464
I don't know,
what did she mean

21:05.464 --> 21:06.832
about that "big,
round duff" comment?

21:06.832 --> 21:08.100
Now, Dad...

21:08.100 --> 21:09.501
You know, the sands of time

21:09.501 --> 21:11.770
don't exactly flow up
the hourglass.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.674
It's not easy for a guy our age.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.042
Dad, for the last time,

21:17.042 --> 21:18.443
we are not the same age.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.312
I mean, I've seen your
hips start to spread...

21:20.312 --> 21:23.282
For Pete's sake, my hips
have nothing to do with this...
