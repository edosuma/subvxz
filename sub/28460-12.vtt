01:41.750 --> 01:44.834
in here and chanting "Greg"?

01:44.917 --> 01:48.166
Because this isn't college and

01:44.917 --> 01:48.166
you're not doing a keg stand?

You were there.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.583
Look at them.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.291
It is like they are addicted

02:26.667 --> 02:29.291
to the pool.

02:29.375 --> 02:31.917
And they have one at home. I

02:29.375 --> 02:31.917
mean, we got a color TV in here.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.834
Yeah, I always love

02:32.000 --> 02:34.834
connecting with you.

02:34.917 --> 02:38.000
I do not understand it.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.000
Okay, Greg, if you really

02:38.083 --> 02:40.000
want your family

02:40.083 --> 02:42.500
to come in here so bad, just

02:40.083 --> 02:42.500
tell 'em we want to be alone.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.917
That usually brings 'em running.

02:45.917 --> 02:47.667
That's a great idea.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.000
I'll be right back.

02:49.083 --> 02:50.250
And easy on the grapes,

02:49.083 --> 02:50.250
all right?

03:16.125 --> 03:17.166
(chuckles)

03:17.250 --> 03:19.208
Um, can I go back in the pool?

03:19.291 --> 03:21.458
Uh, yeah, sure. Just, uh, uh,

03:19.291 --> 03:21.458
be sure to tell everybody

03:21.542 --> 03:23.208
how lit it is in here.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.208
Okay?

03:23.291 --> 03:25.208
I guess if it

03:23.291 --> 03:25.208
comes up organically.

03:25.291 --> 03:27.291
But it kind of feels

03:25.291 --> 03:27.291
desperate otherwise.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.291
So... bye.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.917
Wh-What do you mean, desperate?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.417
Greg, honey, who cares

03:31.000 --> 03:33.417
if your family thinks

03:33.500 --> 03:35.291
you're less generous than Matt?

03:35.375 --> 03:36.792
Who is poor, by the way.

03:35.375 --> 03:36.792
I mean,

03:36.875 --> 03:38.792
let's see him get a cabana

03:36.875 --> 03:38.792
for the family.

03:38.875 --> 03:42.083
It's a lot harder than just,

03:38.875 --> 03:42.083
you know, booking rooms.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.417
Is it, though?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.250
No, it's pretty much

03:43.500 --> 03:45.250
the exact same thing.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.333
But still!

03:46.417 --> 03:48.083
He just booked it

03:46.417 --> 03:48.083
for the free nights.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.083
Wait, what was that?

03:49.166 --> 03:50.625
Free nights?

03:50.709 --> 03:52.625
Yeah. On Hotels.com,

03:50.709 --> 03:52.625

03:52.709 --> 03:53.917
for every ten you stay.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.417
Colleen was telling me

03:54.000 --> 03:55.417
all about it

03:55.500 --> 03:57.041
on the flight over.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.041
By the way,

03:57.125 --> 03:58.458
she will still keep talking

03:58.542 --> 04:00.709
even if you pretend

03:58.542 --> 04:00.709
you're asleep.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.792
Unbelievable.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.667
Hey, Jen.

04:04.750 --> 04:05.750
I got your text.

04:05.834 --> 04:07.458
You want to make fun

04:05.834 --> 04:07.458
of Greg in private?

04:07.542 --> 04:09.291
Ha! No.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.291
(laughs)

04:09.375 --> 04:11.458
I sent that text

04:09.375 --> 04:11.458
from Jen's phone,

04:11.542 --> 04:13.834
and you came running

04:11.542 --> 04:13.834
like a little idiot.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.041
JEN:

04:13.917 --> 04:15.041
Oh, my God. Greg,

04:15.125 --> 04:17.458
you said you would let me leave

04:15.125 --> 04:17.458
before you did this.

04:17.542 --> 04:19.542
No, Jen, I want you here

04:17.542 --> 04:19.542
to witness this.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.125
Prepare to be

04:19.625 --> 04:22.125
even more attracted to me.

04:22.208 --> 04:26.208
I know that you booked

04:22.208 --> 04:26.208
this whole vacation

04:26.291 --> 04:28.417
so that you could get

04:26.291 --> 04:28.417
some free nights.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.834
-Yeah.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.834
-Don't deny it.

04:30.917 --> 04:33.709
Colleen and I haven't taken

04:30.917 --> 04:33.709
a trip by ourselves, ever.

04:33.792 --> 04:35.709
Oh, yeah, she did mention that

04:33.792 --> 04:35.709
on the plane.

04:35.792 --> 04:39.166
Then she used my credit card

04:35.792 --> 04:39.166
to order a Bistro Box.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.875
Well, ha-ha, how about that?

04:40.959 --> 04:43.250
You know, I bet the whole family

04:40.959 --> 04:43.250
would love to know

04:43.333 --> 04:46.250
that you did all of this

04:43.333 --> 04:46.250
just for your own benefit.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.250
I told 'em.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.250
They were all really happy

04:48.333 --> 04:50.166
that we could finally take

04:48.333 --> 04:50.166
a honeymoon together.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.792
Wow.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.792
(clears throat)

04:52.875 --> 04:54.542
It would appear that...

04:54.625 --> 04:56.291
you've covered

04:54.625 --> 04:56.291
all of your bases

04:56.375 --> 04:57.875
and I have...

04:57.959 --> 04:59.542
wasted a lot of money.

04:59.625 --> 05:00.750
Wow, Greg.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.208
This is so hot.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.834
Really sorry

05:02.291 --> 05:04.834
that this upset you so much.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.166
How 'bout I pay for this cabana?

05:06.250 --> 05:07.375
That make you feel better?

05:07.458 --> 05:09.458
Yes. Yes, it would.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.041
Okay.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.083
who's paying for it,

05:16.166 --> 05:17.500

05:45.083 --> 05:47.500
-No. Not even close, babe.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.500
TIM:

05:47.583 --> 05:48.500
Red,

05:48.583 --> 05:50.083
-the color of Sophia's eyes.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.083
-Mm.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.667
WOMAN:

05:50.166 --> 05:51.667
Help! We need a doctor!

05:51.750 --> 05:54.083
-Somebody help!

05:51.750 --> 05:54.083
-HEATHER: Honey,

05:51.750 --> 05:54.083
that guy's choking.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.792
-Oh, my God.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.792
-Okay. Hey.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.542
Look out!

05:55.875 --> 05:57.542
I'm a doctor!

05:57.625 --> 05:59.208
I'm a doctor!

05:57.625 --> 05:59.208
It's okay.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.959
It's okay.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.959
You're all right, sir.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.750
You're all right, sir.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.750
I got you. You ready? You ready?

06:02.834 --> 06:04.917
-(grunting)

06:02.834 --> 06:04.917
-Okay. Come on, come on.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.375
Here we go.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.375
All right.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.166
And one more.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.875
-Let's do it!

06:08.250 --> 06:09.875
-(coughs, gasps)

06:09.959 --> 06:12.083
-Oh! Babe, you did it!

06:09.959 --> 06:12.083
-(applause)

06:15.041 --> 06:16.709
That's my husband!

06:16.792 --> 06:19.291
The-the doctor,

06:16.792 --> 06:19.291
not the choking guy! Oh, God!

06:19.375 --> 06:22.125
-Yes! Yes!

06:19.375 --> 06:22.125
-Thank you. Oh.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.750
And he's good in bed!

06:23.834 --> 06:27.834
Really... just, good in bed!

06:27.917 --> 06:29.917
And then, just like that-- boom,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.333

06:32.417 --> 06:34.166
-(chuckling)

06:32.417 --> 06:34.166
-Way to go, Dad.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.458
Hey, does that help

06:34.250 --> 06:36.458
with your malpractice suit?

06:36.542 --> 06:39.250
That's a whole separate thing.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.250
-Oh.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.250
-That is so amazing.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.291
Hey, you know,

06:41.333 --> 06:43.291
maybe I should be a doctor.

06:43.375 --> 06:44.542
Yeah, sure.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.417
Sure.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.166
And if that wasn't enough,

06:48.250 --> 06:49.709
it was a rich guy.

06:49.792 --> 06:52.125
That's worth, like,

06:49.792 --> 06:52.125
two normal people lives.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.792
Good for you, Dad.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.166
Oh, I wouldn't use

06:53.875 --> 06:56.166
the word "hero," sweetie,

06:56.250 --> 06:58.417
but... I'm not gonna

06:56.250 --> 06:58.417
stop you if you do.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.917
You know what, honey,

06:58.500 --> 06:59.917
I think I'm having

07:00.000 --> 07:02.166
a hard time breathing,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.166
and I might need you

07:02.250 --> 07:03.834
to get behind me later tonight.

07:03.917 --> 07:04.917
-Oh, no.

07:03.917 --> 07:04.917
-Ooh.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.208
Ooh.

07:06.291 --> 07:08.834
You're literally surrounded

07:06.291 --> 07:08.834
by your children.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.834
Oh, oh, you guys,

07:08.917 --> 07:10.834
there he is. Right there.

07:10.917 --> 07:13.875
This is the guy

07:10.917 --> 07:13.875
who owes his life to your dad.

07:13.959 --> 07:16.375
Oh, he doesn't have to

07:13.959 --> 07:16.375
stop and say thank you,

07:16.458 --> 07:18.583
but I'm not gonna deny

07:16.458 --> 07:18.583
him the opportunity to.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.667
Hey. Doc...

07:23.458 --> 07:25.458
That's weird.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.375
-Maybe he's still in shock.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.375
-Yeah. Yeah.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.333
You know what?

07:27.458 --> 07:29.333
I think I'm in shock, too.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.375
I think I might need someone

07:31.458 --> 07:34.333
to knock some life

07:31.458 --> 07:34.333
into me later tonight. Yeah.

07:34.417 --> 07:36.250
-Mom!

07:34.417 --> 07:36.250
-Oh, what?

07:36.333 --> 07:38.625
We're in a public place.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.875
I can't believe

07:40.792 --> 07:42.875
he didn't say thank you.

07:42.959 --> 07:45.000
Mm. I thought you said

07:42.959 --> 07:45.000
he was in shock.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.333
No.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.333
Shock's not a real thing.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.542
It's just something doctors say

07:47.417 --> 07:49.542
when we don't know what's wrong.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.667
Well, go over there. Give him

07:49.625 --> 07:52.667
a chance to say thank you.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.291
-He had his chance.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.291
He walked right by me.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.291
-Ugh.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.959
He embarrassed me

07:55.375 --> 07:56.959
in front of Clementine,

07:57.041 --> 07:58.834
my very own daughter-in-law.

07:58.917 --> 08:02.542
Well, you know, honey, he

07:58.917 --> 08:02.542
probably didn't recognize you.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.333
I mean, the whole thing,

08:02.625 --> 08:05.333
it happened so fast.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.166
I do look like a local.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.542
Oh, yeah.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.500
-Yeah, watch my drink.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.500
-Yeah, you got it.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.125
I'm gonna watch

08:10.583 --> 08:12.125
something else, too, there.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.417
Walk away slowly, hero.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.417
Don't.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.417
You know I hate that.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.083
I can still see it.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.083
Yeah, there's

08:18.166 --> 08:21.083
a lot there to see.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.041
Uh, we'll play tennis

08:21.166 --> 08:23.041
in the morning.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.041
-I'm gonna take a lesson.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.041
-Mm-hmm.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.083
Hey, buddy.

08:25.166 --> 08:26.750
What can I do for you?

08:26.834 --> 08:29.667
Dr. Tim Hughes, lifesaver.

08:26.834 --> 08:29.667
(laughs)

08:29.750 --> 08:31.291
Want to get get your hands

08:29.750 --> 08:31.291
off me, please?

08:31.375 --> 08:32.959
I saved you from choking.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.375
My hands were all over you.

08:34.458 --> 08:36.792
(laughs)

08:34.458 --> 08:36.792
Sir, I think that you've had

08:36.875 --> 08:38.250
a little too much to drink.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.000
Maybe this will jog your memory.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.041
Huh? It's the olive

08:40.083 --> 08:42.041
you almost choked on.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.583
I mean, it's not

08:42.125 --> 08:43.583
the exact same one,

08:43.667 --> 08:45.250
but I did find it

08:43.667 --> 08:45.250
on the ground.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.000
(laughs) I have no idea

08:45.333 --> 08:48.000
what you're talking about.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.208
Honey, let's get out of here.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.250
The guy's putting

08:49.291 --> 08:50.250
the moves on me.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.458
Okay?

08:52.542 --> 08:55.166
You're welcome.

-No.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.750
I could have gotten a selfie

09:01.834 --> 09:03.542
of the two of us posing

09:01.834 --> 09:03.542
with the olive.

09:03.625 --> 09:04.834
Okay, honey, you know what?

09:04.917 --> 09:06.333
You have all of these patients

09:06.417 --> 09:07.709
that really appreciate you.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.291
Okay, so one doesn't.

JOAN:

11:35.792 --> 11:36.834
Oh, well.

11:36.917 --> 11:38.834
How often do you and I get to do

11:38.917 --> 11:42.166
a quiet activity alone together

11:38.917 --> 11:42.166
for two and a half hours?

11:43.208 --> 11:45.333
This is two and a half hours?

11:45.417 --> 11:47.333
Wow. Well...

11:45.417 --> 11:47.333
(clears throat)

anything like your critique

11:49.500 --> 11:52.417
of my breakfast choices,

11:49.500 --> 11:52.417
this is gonna be a lot of fun.

11:52.500 --> 11:56.542
Who eats sushi before 11:30

11:52.500 --> 11:56.542
in the morning?

11:56.625 --> 11:58.375
No, don't raise your hand.

11:58.458 --> 12:01.000
I'm asking the class.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.875
-This is insane.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.875
-(chuckles)

12:06.959 --> 12:09.125
(groans) I'm starving and

12:06.959 --> 12:09.125
I have to go to the bathroom.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.125
I know, I know. Me too.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.125

N-No.

12:16.542 --> 12:20.041
a time limit on these machines.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.750
Sorry. Go fly away,

-Fly away.

-Okay, okay. Okay.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.083
All right.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.083
We have to take a break.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.250
-We have to do something.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.250
-Okay.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.542
Okay, Grandpa.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.125
We're just gonna go ahead

Mom just died.

16:01.959 --> 16:05.417

16:05.500 --> 16:08.208

16:27.125 --> 16:28.709
You, I don't like so much.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.333
But I saved your life.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.166
Yeah, you saved my life,

16:30.417 --> 16:32.166
you killed my marriage.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.834
How could you, Dad?

16:33.917 --> 16:35.834
I told you--

16:33.917 --> 16:35.834
I hated your mother.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.667
But, over time, I...

16:37.750 --> 16:39.667
I grew to hate his, too.

16:54.458 --> 16:55.792

17:16.709 --> 17:18.625

17:20.542 --> 17:23.041

17:23.125 --> 17:25.125
Yeah, but when you

17:23.125 --> 17:25.125
think about it,

17:25.208 --> 17:29.917
what kind of a gym teacher

17:25.208 --> 17:29.917
takes business trips?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.875
I like these. What are these,

18:07.166 --> 18:08.917
I should've known when I saw Dad

18:09.000 --> 18:11.083
having lunch

18:09.000 --> 18:11.083
with another family.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.333
-What? When did that happen?

18:11.166 --> 18:13.333
-Yeah.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.166
At his nursing home.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.333
He said he wanted to eat

18:15.250 --> 18:18.333
with his other family.

18:18.417 --> 18:20.667
You know, I-I smiled

18:18.417 --> 18:20.667
and just left,

18:20.750 --> 18:22.333
knowing I'd done

18:20.750 --> 18:22.333
the right thing,

18:22.417 --> 18:24.208
putting him in that home.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.959
Oh, well, now maybe you don't

18:24.291 --> 18:26.959
have to visit him so much.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.375
And you always complained

18:28.458 --> 18:31.041
about that difficult

18:28.458 --> 18:31.041
parking lot anyway.

18:31.125 --> 18:33.792
I think my dad loves the man

18:31.125 --> 18:33.792
he named after himself

18:33.875 --> 18:35.625
more than he loves me.

18:35.709 --> 18:38.125
And I'll bet that nurse named me

18:38.208 --> 18:40.667
a-after a corpse in the hallway.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.750
John Doe Short,

18:40.750 --> 18:43.750
don't even say that.

18:43.834 --> 18:46.083
You're focusing

18:43.834 --> 18:46.083
on the wrong thing.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.667
I mean, you can be angry

18:46.166 --> 18:48.667
with your father

18:48.750 --> 18:51.333
or you can be happy

18:48.750 --> 18:51.333
you have a brother.

18:51.417 --> 18:54.041
I mean, you always wished

18:51.417 --> 18:54.041
for a brother, right?

18:54.125 --> 18:56.417
Yeah. To teach me

18:54.125 --> 18:56.417
to play the guitar.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.000
But does Stuart even know how?

18:59.083 --> 19:01.333
I mean, he's obviously

18:59.083 --> 19:01.333
a cool guy,

19:01.417 --> 19:04.291
but who knows if he's musical?

19:04.375 --> 19:07.250
Well, why don't you talk

19:04.375 --> 19:07.250
to him and find out?

19:08.834 --> 19:10.750
Oh, sure.

19:08.834 --> 19:10.750
Yeah, jazz,

19:10.834 --> 19:12.667
classical, calypso,

19:12.750 --> 19:15.333
rock, blues.

19:15.417 --> 19:17.375
I hate every kind of guitar.

19:17.458 --> 19:20.125
-Oh. Oh, well, then,

19:17.458 --> 19:20.125
-Hmm.

19:20.208 --> 19:23.542
uh, maybe you two can find

19:20.208 --> 19:23.542
something else to bond over.

19:23.625 --> 19:24.959
No.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.333
No, I'm a man

19:25.041 --> 19:27.333
of very few interests.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.750
I'm just a guy

19:27.417 --> 19:30.750
who spent his life in the skies.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.000
Oh, you're a pilot, too?

19:33.083 --> 19:34.291
Flight attendant!

19:34.375 --> 19:36.041
Oh. Yeah.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.625
W-Well, we'll-we'll

19:36.125 --> 19:38.625
find something.

having a brother takes

a little getting used to.
