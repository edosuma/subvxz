00:01.000 --> 00:02.491
Take that car out. Shoot!

00:07.907 --> 00:09.499
My name is Michael Knight.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.840
I'm with the Foundation
for Law and Government.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.173
He's here
to try and help us.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.941
I'm sitting on millions
of dollars worth of oil.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.006
I don't want to be involved
in any killings.

00:17.083 --> 00:20.052
I know how much the Kobe
burial grounds are worth to you.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.317
Somehow, someway, we've got to keep
the tribe and the land together.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.017
I think you know
what has to be done.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.389
We gotta go around.
No room for that, Michael.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.245
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

00:46.312 --> 00:48.906
into the dangerous
world of a man...

00:48.982 --> 00:50.574
who does not exist.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.057
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:01.127 --> 01:03.721
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.797 --> 01:05.890
the helpless,
the powerless...

01:05.965 --> 01:09.332
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.087
Stop!

02:42.428 --> 02:44.123
Is it...

02:44.597 --> 02:45.928
What we came for.

02:46.566 --> 02:49.899
The guardian spirits
of the warrior dead.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.506
The Kobe Indian shrine.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.424
They said
we couldn't do it.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.790
We'll show them, Barbara,
we'll show them we've done it!

03:15.094 --> 03:16.823
Now,
let's get this to Susan.

03:16.896 --> 03:20.024
It's wonderful. You know,
I never believed till now.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.158
Barbara!

03:34.847 --> 03:35.836
Go!

03:46.292 --> 03:48.453
Stress relaxation techniques?

03:48.528 --> 03:49.893
It really works, Michael.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.295
Combined with the right
sort of meditation.

03:52.365 --> 03:56.233
What do you know about stress
relaxation and meditation, anyway?

03:56.302 --> 03:59.863
The best stress relaxation
is two weeks in Maui.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.506
I can't wait.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.134
Your choice of shirts
make that quite apparent.

04:04.210 --> 04:08.544
The luaus, the sun,
girls in bikinis...

04:08.848 --> 04:11.578
the sand,
girls in bikinis...

04:12.085 --> 04:14.815
I'm afraid you're going to have
to settle for a working vacation...

04:14.887 --> 04:16.752
on the Kobe
Indian Reservation.

04:17.123 --> 04:20.524
Oh, Devon, come on, that's
a contradiction of terms.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.158
What about Maui?

04:22.395 --> 04:24.693
Maui's going to have to wait,
Michael.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.498
Have you ever heard
of a Dr. Quentin Tanner?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.893
I can't say that I have.
Why?

04:30.203 --> 04:32.831
He's a noted archaeologist who's
been searching for relics...

04:32.905 --> 04:34.896
on the Kobe
Reservation grounds.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.771
The Foundation has supported
his activities...

04:36.843 --> 04:39.107
on behalf of Native Americans
for years.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.579
Last night, he and his
assistant vanished from the area.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.411
Devon, it seems to me...

04:45.485 --> 04:49.046
that's a thing for the Missing
Persons Bureau or the police.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.146
No time.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.384
The bulldozers will be on the
land before they get there.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.825
There's a conflict between the
Kobe Indians, and some oil man...

04:55.895 --> 04:59.228
over the ownership of the canyon
in which Dr. Tanner was last seen.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.132
You're to contact a social
worker named Susan Christopher.

05:03.770 --> 05:04.930
She believes...

05:05.004 --> 05:07.996
that Dr. Tanner and his
assistant may be in grave danger.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.299
All right.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.343
I'll check it out
on one condition.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.613
No more references
to working vacations.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.749
Look at it this way, Michael.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.910
In the desert, you'll get
just what you wanted.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.647
Oh, yeah. What's that?

05:21.721 --> 05:24.554
The sun, the sand.
But no shirt.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.457
And the heat,
and the dust...

05:27.527 --> 05:30.394
and small little animals
crawling all over your fenders.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.961
Well, here we are, pal.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.864
Looks like we got a
welcoming committee, too, huh?

06:48.307 --> 06:49.467
Careful, Michael...

06:49.542 --> 06:51.806
this doesn't appear
to be a welcoming committee.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.138
I got you.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.375
Go back and tell
Cyrus Oakes...

06:57.450 --> 06:59.975
we've had enough of his people
putting the squeeze on us.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.644
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.260
Come on, hold it!

07:11.330 --> 07:12.991
My name is Michael Knight.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.556
I'm with the Foundation
for Law and Government.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.668
I'm here to see
Susan Christopher.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.101
Come on, guys.
Wait!

07:20.173 --> 07:21.765
I know we can talk
about this.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.365
Wait! Stop!

07:24.377 --> 07:25.935
Wait! Stop!

07:26.012 --> 07:27.673
Will you stop it?

07:29.482 --> 07:30.471
Stop.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.979
I called him.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.578
He's here to try and help us
find Dr. Tanner and Barbara.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.089
We don't need
a white man's help!

07:40.159 --> 07:41.387
Tell that to your mother.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.622
A white doctor delivered
your three brothers.

07:50.670 --> 07:55.039
I'll let him go,
if you promise to hold him.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.335
He'll be no trouble.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.868
You control yourself and
you can join us with Thorne.

08:01.914 --> 08:02.938
It's okay.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.447
Who's Thorne?

08:09.522 --> 08:11.615
He's the curator
of our Kobe Museum.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.085
You must be Susan Christopher.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.622
And you're Michael Knight.

08:15.695 --> 08:16.923
I think so.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.397
I work closely
with Dr. Tanner.

08:20.566 --> 08:24.366
We were hoping to come up with
a major archeological find...

08:24.737 --> 08:28.503
and have the burial grounds
declared a national shrine.

08:28.908 --> 08:32.400
Instead, Cyrus Oakes will be drilling
through the bones of our ancestors...

08:32.477 --> 08:33.740
to get to his oil.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.076
Oakes has acquired
the rights...

08:36.148 --> 08:38.639
to exploit the land
as of 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

08:39.585 --> 08:43.282
Dr. Tanner was our last chance
to keep the grounds intact.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.483
Isn't it a little
far-fetched to believe...

08:45.558 --> 08:48.391
that Oakes grabbed Tanner
before he completed his survey?

08:48.694 --> 08:50.719
I told you
he wouldn't believe us.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.787
I didn't say that.
What I'm saying here is...

08:52.865 --> 08:54.298
I need
a little more explanation...

08:54.367 --> 08:56.460
and a lot more proof
before I'm convinced.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.331
Now, if you don't mind...

08:58.404 --> 09:01.032
I'd like to start with the spot
where Dr. Tanner disappeared.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.166
Susan can take you
out there.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.340
But I doubt
you'll find anything.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.742
Shall we?
Yes.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.888
Nothing like a little
tailgate picnic...

09:24.964 --> 09:26.761
to christen a new
piece of property.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.566
What you're seeing, Lisa,
is diversification.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.967
Real estate, coal, oil.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.635
A natural progression.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.640
The land
and its resources.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.943
Something to grab
a hold onto.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.239
All yours?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.338
Absolutely.

09:42.949 --> 09:44.712
Excuse me. Mr. Oakes?

09:48.688 --> 09:49.677
Yeah.

09:51.557 --> 09:52.546
Yeah?

09:52.858 --> 09:54.485
Mr. Oakes, it's Thorne.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.125
How did you get
my mobile phone?

09:58.197 --> 10:00.563
I told your secretary
it was an emergency.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.760
Well, then it better
be just that.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.427
Michael Knight,
an investigator...

10:04.503 --> 10:07.165
for The Foundation for Law
and Government showed up.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.140
He's on his way out to the burial
grounds now to snoop around.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.040
If you did what
you were supposed to do...

10:12.111 --> 10:14.011
then there shouldn't be
anything there to find.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.547
It's not just that.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.314
Some of the Indians
are thinking he might help...

10:18.417 --> 10:21.944
and I think you're going to have
trouble rounding up drill and rig crews.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.990
I pay people to do a job
and I end up doing it myself.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.253
I'll be out to the
reservation to talk to them.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.261
What about this investigator?

10:30.329 --> 10:31.557
Handle him.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.861
Use Simpson.

10:34.934 --> 10:38.529
Wait a minute, I don't want
to be involved in any killings.

10:39.271 --> 10:42.968
I'm sitting on millions of dollars
worth of oil waiting to be tapped.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.806
You've got 89 cents worth
of Indian relics.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.176
Where do you figure
your future lies?

10:58.791 --> 11:01.021
I'm sorry about
that welcoming committee...

11:01.093 --> 11:02.355
back at the reservation.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.760
But Jonathan Eagle
has quite a temper...

11:04.830 --> 11:07.731
and the others are just frustrated
enough to follow his lead.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.428
You seem to be able
to control him.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.964
I've known him
all my life.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.635
When I got my degree and decided
to come back to the tribe...

11:17.710 --> 11:19.268
it was like I had never left.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.405
Now, this whole issue
of oil is tearing us apart.

11:23.416 --> 11:27.546
You know, I can understand your loyalty
to tradition and to your heritage.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.916
As beautiful as this country
is, I can also understand...

11:30.990 --> 11:33.083
why somebody would want to try
and reach out and grab it.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.558
You've got to help us.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.994
Somehow, someway, we've got to keep
the tribe and the land together.

11:38.731 --> 11:39.720
All right.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.128
I'll do the best I can.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.569
Let's do some
old-style tracking.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.669
Please, no Indian jokes.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.378
This isn't a joke.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.676
As a matter of fact,
you're going to like this one.

13:02.748 --> 13:05.876
KITT, give me an imprint
reconstruction of the area.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.384
I want to find out
if there's any...

13:07.453 --> 13:09.580
evidence of struggle that
took place here last night.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.213
Right away, Michael.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.051
They're certainly putting some
interesting accessories on cars lately!

13:15.127 --> 13:18.153
You know, it's amazing what you can
get through mail order these days.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.720
Thank you, Michael.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.597
I show an unusual pattern
for the last 12 hours.

13:24.069 --> 13:26.401
That looks like
Dr. Tanner's Land Cruiser.

13:26.605 --> 13:27.833
Incredible.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.499
Wait a minute,
one, two, three...

13:30.576 --> 13:33.340
Four sets of footprints
intersect by the car...

13:34.280 --> 13:35.372
then disappear.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.308
He wasn't meeting
anyone out here.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.451
He might have been
ambushed after all.

13:45.424 --> 13:48.154
Susan, show me the area in
the cave where he was digging.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.657
KITT, go into
surveillance mode.

13:50.729 --> 13:51.957
Keep an eye on us,
will you?

13:52.031 --> 13:53.225
Of course, Michael.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.216
Michael.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.886
Yeah, KITT, what is it?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.431
I've detected an intruder
on the rocks above you.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.077
KITT, now listen to me.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.475
Go into electrical
generation mode...

14:46.552 --> 14:49.112
and give me about 200 volts
through the comlink.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.656
It'll cause more damage to you
than to those snakes.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.420
I'm taking it off, right now.
Wait for my signal.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.728
Michael.

15:04.536 --> 15:05.525
Do it, KITT!

15:10.676 --> 15:11.665
Come on!

15:17.950 --> 15:19.076
You all right?

15:19.151 --> 15:21.551
Oh, I'll be fine. I've
seen my share of snakes.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.019
Just not all at once.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.224
Can you locate the guy
on the ridge?

15:26.292 --> 15:28.055
I'm afraid he's gone, Michael.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.995
We've got to be able to stop
Oakes now. Isn't this enough proof?

15:32.064 --> 15:33.292
No, not yet.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.697
Nothing to tie him
directly into any crime.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.235
Guy like Oakes
works through middlemen.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.805
But I think I got a good
idea who those middlemen are.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.335
Who's that?

15:43.642 --> 15:44.904
Susan...

15:44.977 --> 15:48.469
there are only two people
who knew we were coming here.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.040
Eagle and Thorne.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.584
It couldn't be Eagle. Not the
way he feels about the land.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.415
Then it's got
to be Thorne.

15:55.487 --> 15:58.752
He said he was working with
Dr. Tanner at the dig, right?

15:59.224 --> 16:01.522
I've worked with Thorne
for a year.

16:02.227 --> 16:03.717
Susan, it's only a hunch.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.791
But I wouldn't
recommend giving him...

16:05.864 --> 16:07.832
any of our travel plans
from now on.

16:07.900 --> 16:08.992
Come on.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.038
...the land, tradition.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.201
Those values
are very important...

16:51.276 --> 16:53.938
but so are present day
economic realities.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.746
Who are you people
going to listen to?

16:57.082 --> 16:59.573
A welfare worker
paid by the state...

16:59.785 --> 17:03.721
who has nothing to gain by
this influx of money and jobs?

17:03.789 --> 17:07.589
How much money has she put in
your jeans since she came back?

17:07.659 --> 17:08.683
None.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.423
When you people start to do
well, she's out of her job.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.656
I don't believe it.

17:12.731 --> 17:16.359
Or are you going to listen to
that investigator in the fancy car.

17:17.269 --> 17:21.103
He's got a steady salary coming
in from a place called FLAG.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.105
Creep.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.540
So, that's the infamous
Cyrus Oakes.

17:25.611 --> 17:30.378
Now, I can guarantee you six months
employment at double minimum...

17:30.449 --> 17:32.713
to each and anyone of you...

17:32.785 --> 17:36.084
who show up at my compound
tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.213
Eagle.

17:37.289 --> 17:41.055
And Oakes Industries can also
guarantee plenty of overtime.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.559
Wait a minute!

17:42.995 --> 17:45.225
How can you shake
this man's hand?

17:45.297 --> 17:48.528
He's stealing your land.
He's taking your birthright.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.595
He's offering them jobs,
Eagle.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.034
Jobs, not ghosts.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.972
Is that what you think this
is about, Simpson? Ghosts?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.908
This land is the heart
of our tribal heritage.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.308
Get lost, kid.

18:01.447 --> 18:05.042
Wait, don't go. Stay!
This is your land.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.607
You were born here.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.175
You have a right
to this land.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.691
Why, you dirty...

18:18.664 --> 18:19.756
What's the matter?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.963
Looks like
you've just seen a ghost.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.332
That's Michael Knight.

18:24.403 --> 18:25.893
I thought you
took care of this.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.103
You seem to know so much,
Mr. Knight.

18:31.176 --> 18:33.167
Since when did you
become an Indian?

18:33.245 --> 18:36.237
When I went through
a snake ceremony and lived.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.775
You sound like a lucky man.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.476
I wouldn't push it
if I were you.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.750
You're not me.

19:05.944 --> 19:07.104
May I help you?

19:07.880 --> 19:10.781
I knew it.
In my heart, I knew it.

19:18.056 --> 19:19.819
What in the world
are you doing?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.619
It is as my dream foretold.

19:23.061 --> 19:25.586
The God of the wind
has come down...

19:25.931 --> 19:29.833
to instruct us
in this time of crisis.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.233
I beg your pardon.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.498
Cross-checking my data bank
on tribal customs...

19:33.605 --> 19:35.596
I find that your
God of the wind...

19:35.674 --> 19:37.471
materializes as a horse.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.534
It is 1985.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.171
So, in your wisdom...

19:42.481 --> 19:45.245
you have chosen, instead...

19:45.317 --> 19:47.808
to come as a car.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.353
No, I haven't.

19:50.455 --> 19:51.479
Ah!

19:51.990 --> 19:55.323
You are trying to trick me,
as the legend said you would.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.831
But I know you, Great One.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.161
I know you.

20:04.803 --> 20:08.603
Well, I have to agree,
I could be compared...

20:08.674 --> 20:10.574
to lightning
on a summer's day...

20:10.742 --> 20:13.438
wise as an all-seeing hawk,
hmm?

20:13.512 --> 20:16.538
Blessed is the servant
of the mighty steed.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.614
He will do great things.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.586
Servant.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.855
You know, Michael, I never
thought of it that way.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.661
Well, don't start to,
"mighty steed."

20:34.833 --> 20:37.461
Sometimes I don't think
you appreciate me enough.

20:37.536 --> 20:41.131
All right, God of the road,
all-powerful one...

20:41.440 --> 20:43.806
if I may check if my
suspicions are on target...

20:43.875 --> 20:46.935
please beam
your all-seeing scan...

20:47.012 --> 20:49.947
on Mr. Simpson's shoes
and his truck.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.150
You don't have to rub it in.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.580
Now, compare them with the
footprints from the ravine...

20:55.654 --> 20:57.121
and the snake attack.

21:00.292 --> 21:01.623
We have a double match.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.127
And, Michael, you can
stop worshipping me now.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.356
I see your point.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.795
Good. Thanks, pal.

21:11.169 --> 21:14.400
All right, let's go talk
to our snake man.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.429
All right, the game
of tag is over, snake man.

21:40.499 --> 21:41.796
And you're it.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.129
What's your beef?

21:43.201 --> 21:46.398
You cut me off. You're the one
who's looking for trouble.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.768
You tried to kill me.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.672
And chances are you're involved
with Tanner's disappearance.

21:50.742 --> 21:52.209
Now, you wanna talk to me?

21:52.277 --> 21:54.006
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.603
Call the cops
or cut me lose.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.548
There's no cops now, man.
It's just you and me.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.209
What do you want
from me?

22:00.285 --> 22:02.253
Like I said,
it's tag and you're it.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.188
Now you belong to me and
it's just a matter of time...

22:05.257 --> 22:06.918
before I come up
with enough facts...

22:06.992 --> 22:08.721
to come back
and take possession.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.092
Now, you tell that to Oakes.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.429
Michael, would you explain
that last bit of action to me?

22:19.504 --> 22:21.062
I assume you have a plan.

22:21.139 --> 22:22.367
It's simple.

22:22.441 --> 22:25.672
We don't have much time before
Oakes takes possession of the land.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.575
One of you left a trail.

22:34.453 --> 22:36.478
Michael Knight's
headed over here.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.853
Now, he's got a reason
to be here. You don't.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.324
I'm here
because I'm scared!

22:41.393 --> 22:42.382
Scared?

22:42.461 --> 22:44.326
I don't care if you're shaking
like a leaf.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.330
If you're spotted here with me
before we take that land tomorrow...

22:47.399 --> 22:49.026
this whole deal
can fall apart!

22:49.101 --> 22:51.729
It's gone too far.
Farther than you ever said.

22:51.803 --> 22:53.430
I'm willing to settle
for a percentage...

22:53.505 --> 22:55.473
of what you promised
if I can have it now.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.837
So you can turn around and tell
Michael Knight everything you know, huh?

23:00.912 --> 23:01.936
No!

23:02.013 --> 23:03.480
I just wanna get away.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.613
I don't want any trouble.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.917
How about you?
You feel the same way?

23:09.654 --> 23:11.986
I only told you what
happened to me so you'd know.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.957
I still want
my end of the payoff.

23:14.860 --> 23:17.420
And I'll do what I have to do
to get it.

23:20.031 --> 23:21.225
All right.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.832
Okay, Thorne,
you go wait in the cook shed.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.035
I gotta send for the cash.
You do want cash, don't you?

23:32.110 --> 23:34.044
Please. Thank you.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.847
I think you know
what has to be done.

23:42.387 --> 23:43.684
Anything else?

23:44.990 --> 23:47.254
Yeah. One little detail.

23:47.592 --> 23:52.154
You'll arrange it so they both go
together. Him and that Knight character.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.043
I'd say Oakes has got
a pretty big...

24:06.111 --> 24:07.305
stake in this operation.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.609
And he's protecting it
very carefully, Michael.

24:09.681 --> 24:11.239
That fence is electrified.

24:11.516 --> 24:15.179
Its control grid goes back to
a timed computer-locking system.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.914
Okay. Use your Comprehensive
Configuration Analysis...

24:17.989 --> 24:20.514
and give me a rundown
on any weak spots.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.087
Do you know what the penalty
is for kidnapping?

24:27.566 --> 24:30.126
Yeah. About the same
as it is for murder.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.470
You have the mentality
of a Cro-Magnon man.

24:38.777 --> 24:41.507
Maybe, but at least
I know where I am.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.177
And I ain't no prisoner.

24:58.597 --> 24:59.825
This is Lucas.

24:59.965 --> 25:03.901
Get over to my office. I've
got a bonus job for you.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.231
Sure thing, Mr. Oakes.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.140
Lucas will take you
to the bank.

25:18.617 --> 25:20.881
Oakes has arranged
for the money in cash.

25:21.453 --> 25:22.681
$25,000.

25:22.754 --> 25:23.743
Thanks.

25:27.893 --> 25:29.292
He's all yours.

25:37.969 --> 25:39.129
Michael.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.762
Yeah, KITT,
that's Thorne's car.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.515
He's heading right at us,
Michael.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.992
Scan the car, right now.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.722
Michael, Thorne's inside,
unconscious...

26:05.797 --> 26:07.958
and there's a packet
of explosives in the trunk.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.861
Can we turbo boost?
Not enough room.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.024
We've got to go around.
No room for that, Michael.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.855
KITT, dig in! Dig in!

27:12.631 --> 27:14.064
I have no traction, Michael.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.531
The whole slope's
coming apart.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.192
I'm going to hit Turbo Boost.

27:17.268 --> 27:19.293
Try and land us
someplace solid.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.586
Well, looks like Oakes figured he'd
get two for the price of one, huh?

27:36.087 --> 27:39.579
Setting Thorne up
and using him as bait for me.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.525
I'm afraid he came very close.
I'll need Bonnie.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.754
You got her.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.425
Michael, I've been getting
some strange readouts from KITT.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.693
It's like an earthquake.

27:48.767 --> 27:51.327
No, no. Just a rock slide.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.562
I wish I thought you were
kidding. Is KITT all right?

27:55.073 --> 27:58.531
I'm fine, thank you.
I love you, too.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.940
But KITT's gonna need
some stabilizer readjustment.

28:02.814 --> 28:03.906
We're coming in.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.111
I'll be here.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.261
So much for that.

28:19.898 --> 28:23.356
Man! Those stabilizers
were hit over, under...

28:23.435 --> 28:25.027
sideways, down.

28:25.670 --> 28:28.662
Michael, didn't you read that
part of the driver's manual...

28:28.740 --> 28:30.935
where it says, "Watch out
for the falling rocks"?

28:31.009 --> 28:32.567
Yeah, right. Thanks.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.578
And speaking of
Foundation manuals...

28:34.646 --> 28:38.844
the Foundation Manual specifically
states on page 47, section C...

28:38.917 --> 28:41.283
"When not
otherwise engaged...

28:41.352 --> 28:44.651
"the semi driver should
be behind the wheel."

28:44.723 --> 28:47.089
Yeah, but Bonnie's
autopilot is so smooth.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.318
Too smooth.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.385
Now, see, I would prefer a more
personalized driving experience.

28:51.463 --> 28:52.623
We know that
you just got here...

28:52.697 --> 28:53.891
but you really
must be going.

28:53.965 --> 28:55.091
You got it.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.903
It really is a trifle unsettling
to find RC chatting away in here...

28:58.970 --> 29:02.963
while 30 tones of truck rolls
down the highway, driverless.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.766
Well, Michael...

29:05.110 --> 29:07.670
our check on Mr. Oakes
proved most fruitful.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.808
Seven years ago,
he tried to cheat...

29:09.881 --> 29:12.679
an Indian tribe in Oklahoma
out of some oil rich land.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.380
He was convicted
on 13 counts of land fraud.

29:17.455 --> 29:21.084
But he appealed and beat
the case on a technicality.

29:21.359 --> 29:22.986
A most unsavory man.

29:24.062 --> 29:25.757
He makes me fear the worst...

29:25.930 --> 29:28.023
for Barbara Ralston
and Dr. Tanner.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.930
Devon, I don't think so.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.266
Oakes tried to kill me twice.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.430
And his compound
in the middle of the desert...

29:34.506 --> 29:36.804
has more security
than an army barracks.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.502
I think
he's hiding them there.

29:38.676 --> 29:39.870
I want to get them out.

29:39.944 --> 29:44.108
Well, I would avoid a second frontal
attack on the compound, if I were you.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.581
I'm way ahead of you.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.551
I think I know enough
about Oakes right now...

29:48.620 --> 29:50.144
to find a different
way in.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.781
Here's his agenda for the
day. Thank you very much.

29:53.224 --> 29:54.987
Oh!
Looks like he's throwing...

29:55.059 --> 29:57.550
an exclusive business
party tonight, at a club.

29:58.096 --> 30:01.088
As always, your computers
are way ahead of everyone.

30:01.299 --> 30:04.291
Right down to where he gets
his hair and nails done.

30:04.369 --> 30:07.236
It'd be a shame to interrupt
his moment of pleasure.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.232
...and I will talk
to you soon.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.304
Michael,
where have you been?

30:46.578 --> 30:50.105
I ran into a small explosion
at Oakes' base camp.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.375
So did Thorne.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.044
He's dead.

30:53.484 --> 30:55.247
Oh, no.

30:56.387 --> 30:57.854
Seems like every time
you turn around...

30:57.922 --> 30:59.446
there's more madness
going on.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.425
Look, I'm pretty sure Oakes
is hiding Barbara Ralston...

31:02.493 --> 31:04.051
and Dr. Tanner
at his base camp.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.358
If they're alive.
I think they are.

31:06.497 --> 31:09.466
Now, I believe that canyon out
there is your sacred shrine...

31:09.534 --> 31:12.002
and Dr. Tanner found
some kind of proof of that.

31:12.570 --> 31:15.334
I knew it.
I always knew it.

31:15.406 --> 31:19.604
Oakes is gotta be keeping him under wraps
until he can grab all the land for himself.

31:19.677 --> 31:21.042
Now, you listen to me.

31:21.312 --> 31:24.907
Until 8:00 tomorrow morning,
that land out there is yours.

31:25.283 --> 31:28.548
I want you to get everybody who
wants to save their burial ground...

31:28.620 --> 31:30.383
out there tomorrow morning
and dig.

31:30.455 --> 31:33.390
Now, if I'm late, you stay
there. Just buy me some time.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.426
Oakes won't let us stay
very long.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.352
I don't want
my people hurt.

31:37.428 --> 31:40.886
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you or your people.

31:45.103 --> 31:48.038
Well, it's my acolyte. Hello.

31:48.873 --> 31:50.670
I knew you'd come back.

31:51.009 --> 31:53.671
I've come for my first lesson,
Great One.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.470
In what?

31:57.115 --> 31:59.106
The Secrets.
Ah, yes.

31:59.217 --> 32:02.550
Of the universe, as it were.
Well, let's see...

32:03.221 --> 32:04.688
Let's start simple.

32:05.290 --> 32:08.453
Basic stress relaxation
and meditation technique.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.822
Clear your mind.
Concentrate on your breathing.

32:12.163 --> 32:15.826
Great One, my tribe has known
these things for centuries.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.802
Well, of course, but you must
start with what you know...

32:19.871 --> 32:24.240
and, in your own way, get to
the great truth by small steps.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.298
I see.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.708
You shelter
your deepest wisdom...

32:27.812 --> 32:31.908
and in that way tell me
to find my own path.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.211
Exactly.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.582
Then I will trouble you
no more.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.547
Goodbye, Great One.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.591
Goodbye, my friend.
I think I'll miss you.

32:43.728 --> 32:47.323
You know, Michael, this
being a God is very demanding.

32:48.533 --> 32:52.401
Yeah, well, stick with
what you do best. Let's go.

33:00.411 --> 33:01.810
Thank you, sweetheart.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.840
This is called luxury, Jim.

33:05.917 --> 33:09.546
A 50-year-old barber
and a hot towel is luxury.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.815
There's got to be
a better word for this.

33:11.923 --> 33:14.721
There is, but none of them
are very nice.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.623
You can't come in here,
it's private.

33:16.694 --> 33:17.888
Well, I'm already in...

33:17.962 --> 33:20.396
and throwing me out could
prove hazardous to your health.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.126
Let Mr. Knight in.

33:27.271 --> 33:28.499
Who's your friend?

33:28.573 --> 33:31.906
Cyrus and I go back
to the Curran County days.

33:31.976 --> 33:35.912
Back to when his game was running
the oil fields in Indian land.

33:38.783 --> 33:40.648
We'd better talk
about this elsewhere.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.720
You're one hell of an
investigator, Mr. Knight.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.922
But you're
really pushing it now.

33:50.161 --> 33:51.560
You know, you're right.

33:51.629 --> 33:54.860
I mean, why spoil your pleasures
by dredging up any more of the past?

33:54.932 --> 33:56.331
I'll get right
to the point.

33:56.401 --> 33:59.063
I know how much the Kobe
burial grounds are worth to you.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.032
And how much your old record
could screw things up.

34:02.106 --> 34:04.666
Uh-huh? And what do you plan
to do about it?

34:04.742 --> 34:05.800
Nothing...

34:05.943 --> 34:08.935
for, say,
half a million dollars...

34:09.213 --> 34:10.202
cash.

34:13.650 --> 34:14.844
You're crazy.

34:14.918 --> 34:16.819
Easy, Cyrus. Easy.
You know...

34:16.888 --> 34:20.119
I know it takes a bit of time to
raise that kind of money. Even for you.

34:20.190 --> 34:23.092
So I'll settle for an initial
installment of, say...

34:23.161 --> 34:24.889
$50,000.

34:24.962 --> 34:27.054
Cash, of course.
Tonight.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.760
All right.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.362
But you're gonna have to come
and collect it from my compound.

34:35.940 --> 34:39.431
I've got a business dinner.
It'll be a couple of hours. Fine.

34:39.710 --> 34:43.271
It's a tough road,
but I know it very well.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.987
Michael, I can't believe...

34:55.059 --> 34:57.289
you're going to walk right
into Cyrus Oakes' compound.

34:57.361 --> 34:59.488
I'm not.
But you just said you were.

34:59.564 --> 35:03.227
No, I said I told Oakes I was.
There's a difference.

35:03.801 --> 35:05.826
I've got something else
in mind.

35:06.671 --> 35:09.333
Michael Knight's on his way
over there to meet with me.

35:09.874 --> 35:11.865
When he gets there,
you hold him.

35:12.210 --> 35:15.236
I'll be there and deal with
him in a more permanent fashion.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.266
All right,
scan the camp personnel.

35:36.334 --> 35:37.733
Right away, Michael.

35:39.203 --> 35:41.831
There's a concentration of men
by the front gate.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.067
Yeah. I'll bet you
they're waiting for me.

35:44.475 --> 35:48.411
Wait a minute. They're
keeping a guard by that hut.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.977
Close in and give me
an infrared scan.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.448
I think we just found Dr.
Tanner and Barbara Ralston.

35:56.687 --> 35:58.587
All right, I'm going in.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.812
Okay, KITT, neutralize
the fence, will you?

36:34.425 --> 36:35.414
Thanks, pal.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.049
Dr. Tanner?

37:38.656 --> 37:41.784
Wait, wait, wait.
My name is Michael Knight.

37:41.859 --> 37:45.090
I'm a friend of Susan Christopher's.
I'm here to get you out.

37:45.162 --> 37:47.630
Come on. Trust me.
Come on, come on.

38:24.335 --> 38:25.859
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:28.906 --> 38:30.203
Okay, go.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.138
No. Don't touch the fence.
Don't, don't.

38:34.211 --> 38:36.406
We've got them now.
Hold it, or you're dead.

38:42.887 --> 38:46.015
Nice watch.
You won't be needing this.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.086
Move it, smart guy.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.774
Let's move them out. I want
to be there by 8:00 a.m.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.585
Susan...

39:26.664 --> 39:30.122
we're running out of time. It's
almost 8:00. Where's this guy Knight?

39:30.601 --> 39:34.901
God of the wind will come.
As he said he would.

39:35.439 --> 39:36.872
Yeah, sure.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.643
The wind ain't gonna stop
Oakes' men from busting heads.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.736
And I got a family.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.582
Why don't you face it?
It's over. Listen to me!

39:46.884 --> 39:48.875
It's not over.
Listen to me!

39:48.953 --> 39:50.716
Listen to me!

39:50.788 --> 39:53.256
All I'm asking is
that we stand here...

39:53.324 --> 39:55.622
just a little while,
while they come...

39:55.693 --> 39:57.888
and demonstrate
our feeling for this land.

39:57.962 --> 39:59.327
What good will that do?

40:00.030 --> 40:02.260
The land belongs
to Oakes.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.857
Not yet, it doesn't.

40:04.301 --> 40:06.997
Michael Knight has still
got something to say.

40:07.104 --> 40:09.402
And from what I've
learned about him...

40:10.341 --> 40:11.865
he'll be here to say it.

40:14.478 --> 40:15.672
Please.

40:15.746 --> 40:16.906
Let's go.

40:18.682 --> 40:21.708
Let's go.
Come on guys, one more try.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.257
Well, I'm sorry our
meeting was delayed...

40:32.329 --> 40:35.355
but I'm afraid you've caused
some real trouble now.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.598
For yourself
and your friends.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.099
Let go of me!
Where are you taking her?

40:42.606 --> 40:44.096
Let go!

40:44.408 --> 40:47.502
In fact, Mr. Knight,
you might say you killed them.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.909
Let them go, Oakes,
you got what you wanted.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.447
And I intend to keep it.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.481
You're going to join them
in a different way.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.316
I think we'll give you another
crack at the electrified fence.

40:58.055 --> 41:00.046
Goodbye, Mr. Knight.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.700
All right, KITT, I could use
a little posse to the rescue.

41:52.810 --> 41:54.710
I'm surrounded
by the bad guys.

41:54.778 --> 41:55.767
Right away, Michael.

42:19.803 --> 42:22.533
Okay, KITT, lay some smoke and
run some interference for me.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.439
Take that car out. Shoot!

42:50.467 --> 42:52.264
Cover me, pal.
Cover me. Go!

43:06.784 --> 43:08.411
Game's over, snake man.

43:11.889 --> 43:13.288
Come on.

43:15.526 --> 43:16.515
Come on.

43:23.534 --> 43:24.592
Go.

44:03.974 --> 44:06.966
All right, pal,
give me Super Pursuit Mode.

44:07.044 --> 44:08.511
With pleasure, Michael.

44:25.863 --> 44:28.798
This land is the property
of Oakes Industries.

44:29.166 --> 44:33.296
If you people don't disperse,
you will be forcibly removed.

44:33.370 --> 44:35.998
I'm not gonna take that.

44:37.975 --> 44:39.943
All right, give me
everything you've got!

44:41.612 --> 44:42.601
Let's go!

44:51.955 --> 44:54.685
I'm not gonna tap dance.
Get rid of them, now.

44:55.092 --> 44:57.287
Come on, guys.
You heard him!

45:13.043 --> 45:15.477
Get him!
Hey, wait a second, guys.

45:16.814 --> 45:20.978
I'd think twice before you become
accessories to kidnap and murder.

45:21.318 --> 45:22.717
You heard what I said!

45:22.786 --> 45:24.811
If there is any
oil on this land...

45:25.289 --> 45:28.690
it belongs to the tribe and
you don't need Oakes to get it.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.124
Michael!

45:34.898 --> 45:36.024
I wouldn't.

45:40.137 --> 45:41.468
Where you're going...

45:41.538 --> 45:44.234
you're going to end up with all
the land you're ever going to need.

45:44.308 --> 45:48.210
An eight-by-eight cell.
No digging allowed.

45:57.888 --> 46:00.914
Come on, Michael. We could use
another pair of strong arms.

46:00.991 --> 46:03.152
You can see
how much fun it is!

46:03.227 --> 46:05.957
I've kinda got my hands
full over here, Doc.

46:06.363 --> 46:07.887
Hi.
Hi.

46:09.233 --> 46:11.064
You think there's any
other caves around here...

46:11.135 --> 46:13.069
that we could
kinda search privately?

46:13.437 --> 46:15.428
I don't think Eagle
would like it.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.733
You and Eagle?

46:19.476 --> 46:21.341
Since we were
seven years old.

46:21.411 --> 46:22.400
Oh.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.646
But he'll understand this.

46:31.522 --> 46:33.717
Thank you.
Thank you.

46:33.857 --> 46:36.485
Take care of yourself.
I will.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.026
Okay. Goodbye.

46:51.542 --> 46:52.839
These are beautiful.

46:54.178 --> 46:58.342
These are simply my way of
offering thanks to both of you...

46:58.949 --> 47:02.441
for your help in our crisis
as the legend foretold.

47:02.886 --> 47:04.012
Thank you.

47:05.455 --> 47:07.946
You know, Michael, I did
fulfill the ancient promise...

47:08.025 --> 47:09.617
of their God of the wind.

47:09.993 --> 47:11.984
Please. Don't get it
into your circuits...

47:12.062 --> 47:15.122
that you have any sort
of divine heritage, all right?

47:15.332 --> 47:16.629
But what if it's true?

47:16.700 --> 47:19.669
Let me answer that question
with a question.

47:20.404 --> 47:23.430
What's wrong with being
a superb piece of machinery...

47:23.507 --> 47:25.168
a partner, a friend?

47:25.242 --> 47:26.334
Nothing at all.

47:26.410 --> 47:28.037
I rest my case.

47:28.111 --> 47:29.305
But, Michael...

47:29.379 --> 47:31.506
you could bring me
flowers some time.

47:31.949 --> 47:33.439
Don't count on it.
