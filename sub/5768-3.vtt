WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:05.296
* Can everybody see
that I'm on fire? *

00:05.330 --> 00:09.505
* Can they tell
you torched me like a car? *

00:09.540 --> 00:12.771
* Do they look
at me discretely? *

00:12.810 --> 00:14.402
* Burning in the street

00:14.440 --> 00:17.739
* I'm just
your average melting heart... *

00:17.780 --> 00:20.044
We're still having trouble
contacting the mom

00:20.080 --> 00:21.274
for an interview.
Any help there?

00:21.320 --> 00:22.617
Jackie? Sure.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.117
She's probably
circling the building.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.084
No, Alicia's mom.
Oh.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.781
That might prove
a little more difficult.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.287
Let me check.
Good.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.252
Now, Will Gardner,
Alicia's boss,

00:31.290 --> 00:32.655
I still want to interview him.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.792
Okay.

00:33.830 --> 00:35.752
How about Diane Lockhart?

00:35.800 --> 00:37.199
We'd prefer Mr. Gardner.
Why?

00:39.100 --> 00:40.135
They went
to Georgetown together.

00:41.470 --> 00:42.801
I'll see what I can do.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.365
Is there anything
else, Mandy?

00:45.410 --> 00:49.278
An interview with Alicia
wouldn't hurt.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.175
(laughs)

00:51.210 --> 00:55.146
It seems this cover story
is more about Alicia than Peter.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.317
No, we've just had
greater access to Peter.

00:56.350 --> 00:58.341
Ah.

00:58.390 --> 01:01.086
* Everybody see
that I'm on fire *

01:01.120 --> 01:04.681
* Did they watch you burn
this mother down? *

01:04.730 --> 01:07.096
* Please don't rescue me

01:07.130 --> 01:09.519
* I'm free to burn out
as I please *

01:09.570 --> 01:11.197
* Just leave me be...

01:11.230 --> 01:12.868
Am I being sandbagged?

01:12.900 --> 01:14.094
Define sandbagged.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.838
Is this a hit piece?
No.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.100
It is an objective profile
of your candidate...

01:21.140 --> 01:23.301
Come on, Mandy, you still
want something from me.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.840
What's going on?
Get me face time
with Alicia Florrick.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.643
Tell me what's up ﬁrst.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.217
I have solid information

01:29.250 --> 01:31.241
of an affair.

01:33.690 --> 01:35.157
Solid information?

01:35.190 --> 01:36.748
What? From the checkout line?

01:36.790 --> 01:39.190
Eli, you asked, so I told.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.492
Get me some face time
with Alicia.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.294
(sighs)

01:43.330 --> 01:45.218
When do you go to press?

01:47.270 --> 01:49.261
This week.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.245
(line ringing)

02:02.290 --> 02:05.145
Come on, Alicia, come on.

02:05.190 --> 02:08.353
This is Alicia Florrick.
Please...

02:08.390 --> 02:10.381
(phone beeps off)

02:20.700 --> 02:24.261
ALICIA:
So, if went looking for your
voice recognition software...

02:24.310 --> 02:26.278
WOMAN:
Our name would be at the top.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.937
ALICIA: And this is
a search engine result

02:27.980 --> 02:30.278
from last year-- June 2011.

02:30.310 --> 02:31.675
That's your sobeare?

02:31.710 --> 02:32.813
Margarita Motions?

02:32.850 --> 02:33.817
Yes.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.341
Julie_and mine.
We named It after our moms.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.608
Margaret and Rita.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.380
Gizmodo considered it the top
voice recognition software

02:41.420 --> 02:43.957
in the country, and you resisted
being bought out by Apple

02:43.990 --> 02:44.979
and Microsoft.

02:45.030 --> 02:48.249
Yes, we wanted to do it
on our own, like our hero,

02:48.300 --> 02:49.665
Neil Gross.
And what happened

02:49.700 --> 02:51.292
after June 2011?

02:51.330 --> 02:53.264
We dropped.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.699
Overnight, we dropped.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.560
Now you have to flip
through 28 pages

02:56.610 --> 02:58.202
of search results to find us.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.901
And if I were to look
for your sobeare

02:59.940 --> 03:02.170
by using your name...?
Try it. Type it in.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.348
"Do you want Margarita Mixes?"

03:06.380 --> 03:07.711
It always corrects that way.

03:07.750 --> 03:08.944
And you say this
happened overnight?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.949
Yes, it did. June 13, 2011.

03:11.990 --> 03:15.209
And why do you know that date
so specifically?

03:15.260 --> 03:17.285
Well, a week earlier,
we were approached

03:17.330 --> 03:18.649
by a sales rep from Chumhum,

03:18.690 --> 03:20.954
Mr. Gross's company.
They wanted us

03:21.000 --> 03:22.729
to buy ads for
the search engine,

03:22.770 --> 03:25.261
and we said no; we wanted
to save the money for hiring.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.198
And then a week later,

03:26.240 --> 03:28.333
you dropped to page 28
in their results?

03:28.370 --> 03:30.736
Yes.
And that's why you're suing
for unfair trade practices?

03:30.770 --> 03:32.806
Yes. The problem is,

03:32.840 --> 03:35.274
if the search engine
doesn't acknowledge you,

03:35.310 --> 03:36.743
you don't exist.

03:36.780 --> 03:37.906
We went bankrupt.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.577
We lost our money,
our parents' money,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.975
our friends' money.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.783
We read your book...

03:43.820 --> 03:45.981
Mr. Gross, we went
to the same college.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.284
We're just trying to do
what you did.
Objection, Your Honor.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.526
Please ask the witness

03:49.560 --> 03:51.027
to refrain from
addressmg my client.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.255
Would you like me to ask
her to not look at him, too?

03:53.300 --> 03:55.495
Okay, do I have
to separate you two?

03:55.530 --> 03:57.395
Can you please speak up?

03:57.430 --> 03:58.658
Nothing further, Your Honor.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.532
LAWYER:
Ms. Sun...

04:01.570 --> 04:04.437
let me read you a review
by the tech blogger

04:04.470 --> 04:07.837
UberTech, posted two days
before your search engine drop.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.599
"Margarita Motions
wasn't just plagiarized.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.799
It stinks."

04:11.850 --> 04:13.545
Don't you think your
search engine drop

04:13.580 --> 04:15.013
was_due to_ the
negative reVIews?

04:15.050 --> 04:18.019
A drop isn't based
on the quality of a product.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.610
It's based on how many people
link to it.
Yes.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.389
But didn't, a week earlier,
competing software,

04:22.430 --> 04:23.954
Wicked Savage Designs,
go on sale?

04:23.990 --> 04:26.652
And isn't it
more popular?
It is now.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.055
Isn't it at the top of all
voice-recognition searches?

04:29.100 --> 04:32.991
Yes, but Wicked Savage
also took out Chumhum ads.

04:33.040 --> 04:33.995
JUDGE MARX:
What?

04:34.040 --> 04:37.931
I said, Wicked Savage
also took out Chumhum ads.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.004
(elevator bell dings)

04:41.040 --> 04:43.008
Well, here we are again.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.302
Good to see you,
Mr. Gross.
This is harassment,
pure and simple.

04:45.350 --> 04:47.318
I don't think _
you've met our newest assoaate,

04:47.350 --> 04:48.772
Cary Agos.
Well, some
people create,

04:48.820 --> 04:50.549
others destroy.
Yup, I'll write that down.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.854
Wait here, please.
We'll be right back.

04:52.890 --> 04:54.448
They got the
whole team.

04:54.490 --> 04:56.082
I'll go get
Julie and Elizabeth?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.951
Good. I want him to negotiate

04:57.990 --> 05:00.720
while our clients _
are staring rIght at hIm.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.728
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

05:04.500 --> 05:05.899
Uh, hello?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.592
Is that him?!

05:08.640 --> 05:10.801
Is that the bastard?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.979
How many drinks
does it take?!

05:13.010 --> 05:15.103
How many?!

05:15.140 --> 05:17.074
You rented out our
conference room?

05:17.110 --> 05:18.179
In my capacity as trustee,

05:18.210 --> 05:20.678
supervising the restructuring
of Lockhart-Gardner,

05:20.720 --> 05:22.540
and taking upon myself the task

05:22.590 --> 05:23.887
of seeking other
cash-flow opportunities...

05:23.920 --> 05:26.047
Mr. Hayden, we need
our conference room.

05:26.090 --> 05:27.489
It's for three days.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.851
They're paying $8,765.

05:28.890 --> 05:30.881
We're in the middle of a
million-dollar negotiation.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.626
Where do you want me to
do it-- in the bathroom?

05:33.660 --> 05:35.719
Out of respect
for his fellow alums,

05:35.760 --> 05:37.421
and without admitting fault...

05:37.470 --> 05:39.119
MAN:
You bitch!

05:39.170 --> 05:40.592
You stupid bitch!

05:42.140 --> 05:46.634
Um... Mr. Gross
is offering $123,000

05:46.680 --> 05:49.444
to help defray Julie
and Elizabeth's

05:49.480 --> 05:51.641
initial
start-up costs.
It's odd, you're not smiling.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.648
Usually when people joke,

05:53.680 --> 05:55.011
they smile.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.381
You turn this down, ladies,

05:56.420 --> 05:57.580
and you'll see what
deep pockets can do.

05:57.620 --> 05:58.746
CARY:
Why don't you refrain

05:58.790 --> 06:00.109
from speaking to our clients,
Mr. Gross?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.718
Why don't you tell them
the truth--

06:01.760 --> 06:02.681
that you have no leverage here.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.426
Leverage belongs to
whomever can outlast.

06:05.460 --> 06:08.395
And money outlasts.

06:08.430 --> 06:10.523
We take this money,
we can start over.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.936
ELIZABETH:
It doesn't even begin
to address what we lost.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.665
JULIE:
He won't pay more.
You heard him.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.565
We have no leverage here.
_ WILL:
Julie, gIve us a day.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.534
If we don't have leverage
by then, take the offer.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.571
WOMAN:
You're the trustee, right?

06:21.610 --> 06:23.578
Yes.

06:23.610 --> 06:24.838
And you are...?

06:24.880 --> 06:26.142
Oh, I'm Viola Walsh.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.977
I'm the defendant in
your current swt.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.011
Unfair trade practices.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.757
May I help you?

06:32.790 --> 06:34.678
You may.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.849
We're gonna fight this
to the last breath.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.549
Your team is working
on contingency.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.568
And you don't fight Waterloo
on contingency.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.058
Now, I know that Will Gardner
likes to battle with his ego,

06:47.100 --> 06:50.069
but I hope more
dispassionate
minds can rule.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.977
Ms. Walsh, you have to negotiate
with Mr. Gardner, not me.

06:53.010 --> 06:55.535
You're watching out for the
creditors, sir. Will isn't.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.605
And I don't think the creditors
are going to be happy

06:57.650 --> 06:58.901
when you throw good work
after bad.

06:58.950 --> 07:00.076
I'm offering cash.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.510
How much?

07:03.550 --> 07:05.518
MAN:
And that's how a search works.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.657
Our software is like a gopher,
but a really fast gopher.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.181
(chittering)
(laughs)

07:12.230 --> 07:14.949
It races through an index

07:15.000 --> 07:16.991
of billions of billions
of Web pages

07:17.030 --> 07:18.566
all connected in a web of links.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.832
We call this gopher Chummie.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.508
After Chummie finds
all the pages

07:24.540 --> 07:25.564
connected to your search...

07:25.610 --> 07:27.202
May I interrupt here?

07:27.240 --> 07:28.502
Yes, Your Honor, of course.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.144
Is it... is it loud enough?

07:30.180 --> 07:31.408
Is this
necessary?

07:31.450 --> 07:34.817
Isn't it just trying to explain
a template-based link analysis

07:34.850 --> 07:36.545
algorithm?

07:36.590 --> 07:38.512
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

07:38.550 --> 07:41.212
Then we can turn it off.
There's no jury. Just me.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.524
VIOLA:
Of course, Your Honor.
My apologies.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.825
So there's no link between ad
sales and search engine results?

07:46.860 --> 07:48.498
That is correct.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.669
Even if I wanted
to Impact the results,

07:50.700 --> 07:51.894
I couldn't.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.568
The algorithm
acts on its own.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.532
We don't touch it.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.037
VIOLA:
Thank you, Mr. Gross.

08:01.910 --> 08:03.775
Why are you shaking
your head, Mr. Gross?

08:03.810 --> 08:05.243
GROSS: I don't know.
The usual reasons.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.771
Disbelief, incredulity,
disappointment.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.946
Ah.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.845
I must be endangering
the future.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.586
No, just being a
bit melodramatic.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.281
So you never tweak
the algorithm?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.527
Chummie, the squirrel,
just acts on his own?

08:17.560 --> 08:18.481
No, I didn't
say that.

08:18.530 --> 08:20.623
But you said
you couldn't impact the results.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.888
Yes.

08:21.930 --> 08:25.764
But the algorithm needs almost
daily attention and revision.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.665
I see.
And why would you revise it?

08:27.700 --> 08:30.635
(scoffs)
Well, for one thing,
to avoid spam.

08:30.670 --> 08:33.730
Spammers are constantly trying
to game the search results.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.270
We adapt the algorithm
to avoid that.

08:35.310 --> 08:37.278
Ah, so the quality
of the Web page

08:37.310 --> 08:38.846
is _taken into account
In the algorithm?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.576
Well, uh, uh,
those are your words, but yes.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.316
And that quality is determined
on an almost-daily basis?

08:44.350 --> 08:46.284
You said,
"tweak the algorithm daily."

08:46.320 --> 08:48.311
Yes.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.783
Did you tweak the algorithm
on June 13, 2011?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.695
I have no idea.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.755
But you said "almost daily,"
so probably?

08:54.800 --> 08:56.256
I have no idea.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.928
You have no idea whether
the algorithm was tweaked

08:58.970 --> 09:01.837
on June 13, 2011,

09:01.870 --> 09:04.759
the day our clients' software
dropped from page one

09:04.810 --> 09:08.632
on your search engine results
to page 28?

09:08.680 --> 09:09.533
That is correct.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.741
Then, Your Honor,
we subpoena Chumhum

09:11.780 --> 09:13.042
for records on their algorithm.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.342
Your Honor, excuse me. No.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.348
The algorithm is the
key to Chumhum's success.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.517
It's their secret sauce.

09:17.550 --> 09:20.348
If you expose the algorithm,
you expose a trade secret.

09:20.390 --> 09:23.325
So? The defendant has admitted
to changing the algorithm

09:23.360 --> 09:24.679
based on quality,

09:24.730 --> 09:27.096
which is the exact subject
of this suit.

09:27.130 --> 09:28.597
Your Honor, I just...

09:28.630 --> 09:29.824
And the only way
to determine whether

09:29.870 --> 09:31.826
the defendant's claims _are true
is to subpoena the eVIdence.

09:31.870 --> 09:33.599
The best evidence rule
applies here, Your Honor.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.538
Your Honor, the plaintiff knows

09:34.570 --> 09:36.299
that we will never
reveal the algorithm.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.807
He is just using

09:37.840 --> 09:38.966
the court authority

09:39.010 --> 09:40.875
so that he can force us
into a settlement.

09:40.910 --> 09:43.344
The difficulty I see, Ms. Walsh,
is that an attribute-based

09:43.380 --> 09:46.247
linked analysis is not
a closed system.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.147
Therefore, it is
subject to manipulation.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.910
So I am prone
to order such a subpoena.

09:51.950 --> 09:53.349
We ask for 24 hours

09:53.390 --> 09:55.255
to prepare our
arguments.
Sorry, I couldn't hear that.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.656
(louder):
We ask for 24 hours to prepare.

09:58.660 --> 09:59.649
(gavelbangs)

10:02.770 --> 10:05.659
Remember when I used
to sleep on your couch?

10:05.700 --> 10:07.395
Eli. What are
you doing here?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.637
Oh, I'm missing a speech to
the National Council of La Raza.

10:10.670 --> 10:12.399
How about you?
Working.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.635
Do you mind
closing the door?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.217
What do you need, Eli?

10:22.220 --> 10:24.245
We've never talked about this.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.259
In fact, I've deliberately
avoided talking about it.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.178
By "it," you mean...?

10:29.220 --> 10:30.721
You and Will.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.292
Just so you know,
I'd rather

10:35.330 --> 10:37.696
be doing anything else.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.865
Okay.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.903
Mandy Post,
the reporter,

10:44.940 --> 10:48.398
wants to talk to you
about your... affair.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.102
Her word.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.777
I pushed Mandy.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.175
She seems to have a copy
of a hotel receipt

10:55.220 --> 10:58.417
for a
September 30, 2011...

10:58.450 --> 11:01.089
encounter. . .

11:01.120 --> 11:03.953
and I need to know
if that timing makes sense.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.798
I don't know.

11:08.830 --> 11:12.869
There is a chance
this all could be a bluff.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.868
But do you have any way

11:14.900 --> 11:18.233
of checking if you were...

11:18.270 --> 11:20.431
if there was a hotel stay?

11:21.780 --> 11:24.044
Is she going to press with this?

11:24.080 --> 11:25.809
She hopes to.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.045
And I hope
to stop her.
Can you?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.918
I don't know.

11:31.950 --> 11:35.989
She likes to think of herself
as a responsible journalist.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.854
The good news is,
responsible journalists
are the easiest to co-opt.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.128
Are you still
seeing him?

11:44.170 --> 11:46.798
Let me put it this way:

11:46.840 --> 11:48.262
if you are still seeing...

11:48.300 --> 11:49.801
(quietly):
Will...

11:49.840 --> 11:52.729
you need to stop.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.736
For a time.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.442
This magazine has been
known to follow people.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.838
I'm not seeing him.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.940
Good.

12:06.990 --> 12:10.858
Can I ask you
when this stopped?

12:12.360 --> 12:13.725
No.

12:15.530 --> 12:18.067
(door opens)

12:18.100 --> 12:21.092
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

12:30.150 --> 12:31.879
(sighs)

12:31.910 --> 12:34.913
(panﬁng)

12:54.840 --> 12:56.831
(phone vibrates)

13:00.080 --> 13:02.036
Yeah?
ELI: It's me.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.378
Where are you?
Don't you come to work anymore?

13:04.410 --> 13:05.809
What do you need, Eli?

13:05.850 --> 13:07.112
Your help.
And first of all, let me say

13:07.150 --> 13:08.572
it's not what you think--
it's only

13:08.620 --> 13:09.814
tangentially
about the campaign.

13:09.850 --> 13:11.044
I'm not helping Peter.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.115
ELI: It's not about--
(phone beeps off)

13:13.160 --> 13:15.185
Who's Peter?

13:15.220 --> 13:16.881
Someone.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.955
You have a lot of
someones in your life.

13:18.990 --> 13:20.799
Yeah.

13:22.230 --> 13:25.927
I want one of your omelets.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.976
Hey, Bill wants
to come over.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.035
To say hi.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.401
You know, he doesn't
blame you anymore.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.113
He's getting the
cast off, and...

13:41.150 --> 13:44.347
I was just thinking
that... (sighs)

13:44.390 --> 13:45.948
Right.

13:45.990 --> 13:49.209
So that's how we're
gonna play it, is it?

14:02.070 --> 14:03.867
How's that?

14:06.610 --> 14:09.135
Yeah, that's better.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.171
(drops knife
to counter)

14:19.920 --> 14:22.184
You know, you have
a strange idea...

14:22.220 --> 14:25.986
of how things work now.

14:26.030 --> 14:28.021
I'm the husband

14:28.060 --> 14:30.460
and you're the wife.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.559
Yeah.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.433
And this isn't
your home anymore.

14:37.570 --> 14:39.902
Clean it up.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.228
(door opens)

15:00.260 --> 15:03.024
(door closes)

15:03.070 --> 15:04.389
Thomas Giles.

15:04.430 --> 15:06.694
I work as _ _
a search engine optimizer.

15:06.730 --> 15:07.662
And what is that?
Ms. Walsh,

15:07.700 --> 15:10.009
I know what _ _
a search engine optimizer is.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.008
(chuckles):
Thank you, Your Honor.
Of course.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.531
When you offer
your services,
Mr. Giles,

15:14.580 --> 15:16.969
what is it that
you guarantee?
To get my clients

15:17.010 --> 15:20.013
onto the first page of
a Chumhum search engine result.
I see.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.018
And did the plaintiffs
hire you to do...

15:22.050 --> 15:24.018
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

15:24.050 --> 15:25.938
This is a preliminary
hearing to discuss

15:25.990 --> 15:28.117
the subpoena
of Chumhum's algorithm.
Yes,

15:28.160 --> 15:30.321
but the question of damages
must be established

15:30.360 --> 15:32.055
before the question
of a subpoena.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.058
How many witnesses
do you intend?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.625
To establish the absence
of damages? Two.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.161
I will allow.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.169
And did the
plaintiffs hire you

15:41.200 --> 15:43.668
to get their product on the
first page of a Chumhum search?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.359
Yes.
In other words,
the plaintiffs hired you

15:45.410 --> 15:47.503
to "game" the system.
Objection!

15:47.540 --> 15:49.178
And the Chumhum algorithm
just countered that gaming...

15:49.210 --> 15:50.370
Objection.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.344
Overruled.
Thank you,
Your Honor.

15:52.380 --> 15:55.213
Miss Holmes,
where do you work?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.013
In Chumhum's
advertising department.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.587
You're the evil advertiser
who approached the plaintiffs

15:59.620 --> 16:01.110
about an online ad?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.458
HOLMES: Well, I hope not evil,
but yes.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.287
And they turned you down.
Yes.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.298
Unfortunately, it happens.
So you immediately

16:07.330 --> 16:08.729
told Mr. Gross, so that he

16:08.760 --> 16:10.762
could meddle with the algorithm
and get back at them?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.132
No.
You didn't?
Really?

16:13.170 --> 16:15.058
Because that just seems
like the sensible next step.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.431
CARY:
Objection.
Withdrawn.

16:16.470 --> 16:19.234
What did you do next,
Miss Holmes?
Well,

16:19.270 --> 16:22.671
after they said no,
I went on vacation.
You did?

16:22.710 --> 16:24.302
For how long?
Two weeks.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.114
And did you tell anyone at
Chumhum about the plaintiff's

16:27.150 --> 16:29.141
ad rejection?
Beforevacation? No.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.317
It was bad news.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.409
I usually hold off on bad news.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.157
So, just so I'm clear,
you never told anyone...
I get it, Ms. Walsh.

16:35.190 --> 16:36.589
Any change in the algorithm

16:36.620 --> 16:39.020
couldn't have come from the
advertismg department

16:39.060 --> 16:41.494
because Miss Holmes
was on vacation.

16:41.530 --> 16:43.020
Do you have any
documentation

16:43.070 --> 16:44.765
to that effect?
Of course, Your Honor.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.529
(elevator bell dings)

16:46.570 --> 16:48.538
You're on it?
Yeah. How long
have I got?

16:48.570 --> 16:50.208
We're back in
court tomorrow.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.435
There's got to be someone
this advertising rep told

16:52.470 --> 16:53.801
before her vacation.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.330
We got this?

17:12.090 --> 17:14.399
Were we together
on September 30 last year?

17:14.430 --> 17:16.227
Together?

17:17.130 --> 17:18.597
I don't know.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.188
Why?
At a hotel?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.162
Maybe. I don't know.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.168
But you paid.
I don't remember,

17:24.210 --> 17:26.428
was it that hotel downtown,
the Fairmont?
I can look.

17:26.470 --> 17:27.835
Thanks.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.179
Mandy Post says she has
a copy of the receipt.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.148
I don't see how she could.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.410
Well, Eli needs
something to...

17:37.450 --> 17:39.179
refute her.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.211
She's gonna
print it?

17:43.790 --> 17:47.089
Eli's having a meeting with her
tonight to convince her not to.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.620
I'll look right away.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.232
You okay?

17:55.440 --> 17:58.603
I don't know.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.108
I feel cursed.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.647
(door closes)

18:07.220 --> 18:08.812
Will...

18:08.850 --> 18:09.942
I like you,

18:09.980 --> 18:13.256
and that's why I'm giving you
a chance to save face.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.552
We're upping
our offer 20%.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.512
MAN (in distance):
You want a divorce?!

18:16.560 --> 18:17.720
You got it!

18:17.760 --> 18:19.682
We want this over.

18:19.730 --> 18:21.595
We're offering $160,000.

18:21.630 --> 18:23.666
(giggling)

18:23.700 --> 18:25.520
Will, I know that

18:25.570 --> 18:27.788
your ego is invested in this,

18:27.840 --> 18:31.765
but I hope that more
dispassionate minds rule.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.774
Oh, no, what
do you have

18:34.810 --> 18:36.903
for us now?
You were right--
it wasn't about

18:36.940 --> 18:40.273
the advertising; that's not why
you messed with the algorithm.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.379
Then why are we still talking?
You messed with
the algorithm

18:42.420 --> 18:44.308
because Mr. Gross
secretly bought out

18:44.350 --> 18:45.886
Wicked Savage Designs.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.252
He bought the top competing
voice-recognition software,

18:48.290 --> 18:50.781
and a week later,
Margarita dropped

18:50.830 --> 18:53.424
on his search engine,
and Wicked Savage climbed.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.291
CARY: We're presenting it
in court tomorrow

18:55.330 --> 18:58.219
unless you come up
with a real offer.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.336
Well, that was
satisfying.

19:03.370 --> 19:05.463
Sometimes the
stars align.

19:15.350 --> 19:17.341
*

19:20.220 --> 19:21.517
(door slams)

19:21.560 --> 19:23.323
What are you doing?

19:24.360 --> 19:26.180
Talking to Viola.

19:26.230 --> 19:29.256
Ms. Walsh? Yes.
We're _in
negobabons
with her!

19:29.300 --> 19:30.324
Calm down, Ms. Lockhart.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.428
No.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.688
You don't sabotage Will.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.731
How am I sabotaging?
By talking to her.

19:35.770 --> 19:36.964
Is she saying Will is

19:37.000 --> 19:39.833
a problematic negotiator
and you need to step in?

19:39.870 --> 19:41.406
Is she lowballing you?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.874
Yes, of course she is!
I'll go to the
judge-- I will

19:43.910 --> 19:46.208
get you replaced for sabotaging
our negotiations, I swear!

19:46.250 --> 19:48.241
I am helping you!

19:49.280 --> 19:51.316
Of course she's
lowballing me.

19:51.350 --> 19:53.511
I'm not dumb.
I'm getting her offer up.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.380
Why do you think she added 20%?

19:55.420 --> 19:57.559
She thinks she's pulling me
on to her side.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.729
But she's not?

20:01.960 --> 20:03.769
Ms. Lockhart...

20:03.800 --> 20:05.927
I work for the firm.

20:05.970 --> 20:09.531
Yes, I have the power
to veto you and Mr. Gardner,

20:09.570 --> 20:11.367
but your success...

20:11.410 --> 20:13.901
is my success.

20:13.940 --> 20:16.272
You have been paranoid
for so long,

20:16.310 --> 20:18.949
you don't recognize
when someone is on your side.

20:21.450 --> 20:23.714
*

20:24.950 --> 20:27.259
No. Actually, I'm
waiting for a call.

20:27.290 --> 20:28.848
I'm just gonna call
about homework.
Eli is calling

20:28.890 --> 20:30.448
this number, and I
don't want to miss it.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.958
I'll get the call waiting.
Grace, I said no.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.992
In ten minutes.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.289
(phone ringing)

20:41.340 --> 20:42.568
Hello?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.807
Alicia?
Yeah. Eli?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.808
Can you talk?
Yeah.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.729
I'm here with Mandy,
talking over the story.

20:49.780 --> 20:50.940
Yeah.

20:51.980 --> 20:54.642
You're in the clear.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.011
(inhales)

20:57.320 --> 20:59.481
How? She got the date wrong?

20:59.520 --> 21:00.487
No.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.885
It's, uh...

21:01.920 --> 21:03.456
i-it's not about you.

21:03.490 --> 21:04.627
Don't worry.

21:05.660 --> 21:08.595
Eli, thank you. I...

21:08.630 --> 21:10.495
Thank you.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.293
Okay, I gotta go.

21:12.330 --> 21:13.661
Take care.
(click)

21:13.700 --> 21:15.361
(sighs with relief)

21:15.400 --> 21:17.402
ZACH:
Is everything all right?

21:18.440 --> 21:20.670
Yeah.
GRACE: Can I have
the phone now?

21:20.710 --> 21:22.371
"May I have the phone now?"

21:22.410 --> 21:24.378
May I?

21:26.380 --> 21:28.041
I love you.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.481
I love you, too.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.488
You all right?
(whispers):
Yeah.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.909
Oh, actually, I do need the
phone, just for one minute.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.427
Now?

21:37.460 --> 21:38.927
Yeah, I left
my cell phone at work.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.762
(phone ringing)

21:47.370 --> 21:48.997
(beep)

21:49.040 --> 21:51.008
Alicia, hi.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.429
How are you?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.107
Okay.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.607
(laughs softly)

21:56.640 --> 21:58.369
We're okay.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.575
You talked to Eli?

22:02.620 --> 22:05.111
Just now.

22:05.150 --> 22:07.118
It wasn't about us.

22:07.150 --> 22:09.357
Good.
Who's it about?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.765
Um... (clears throat)
I've gotta go.

22:19.570 --> 22:21.663
Yeah.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.463
Thanks for calling, Alicia.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.501
You're welcome.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.677
(phone keypad beeping)

22:35.720 --> 22:39.440
(line ringing)

22:39.490 --> 22:41.151
ELI:
You've reached
the voice mail of Eli Gold.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.987
(phone beeps off)

22:43.020 --> 22:46.524
Zach, Grace, I'm going
to go out for a few minutes.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.549
(elevator bell dings)

22:58.010 --> 22:59.966
Alicia, hey.

23:00.010 --> 23:02.103
Everything all right?

23:02.140 --> 23:03.698
I don't know, Eli, is it?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.672
(sighs)

23:05.710 --> 23:06.779
Mandy.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.543
You said it wasn't about us,
so who's it about?

23:11.590 --> 23:12.340
(sighs)
Alicia.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.982
Eli, it's going
to come out anyway.

23:14.020 --> 23:16.659
It's, it's a lie,
it's gossip,

23:16.690 --> 23:18.920
the same as when we thought
it was you and Will.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.518
I'm gonna make this easy.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.424
There's a rumor

23:21.460 --> 23:22.791
of Peter sleeping
with someone last year.

23:22.830 --> 23:25.492
Mandy has
a hotel receipt?

23:27.030 --> 23:28.998
We were separated, Eli.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.060
I'm just getting to
the bottom of this now.

23:34.540 --> 23:37.577
And I haven't told Peter.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.077
Supposedly it's a
campaign worker,

23:39.110 --> 23:41.112
but it's pure fiction.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.218
Alicia...

23:49.260 --> 23:51.626
this is politics.

23:51.660 --> 23:52.888
Peter is vulnerable
in this,

23:52.930 --> 23:55.490
and that is why
it's being used.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.787
What's wrong?

24:21.820 --> 24:23.822
Nothing.
(phone rings)

24:35.040 --> 24:36.996
I have to go.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.009
You know,
you did call me.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.974
I know.

24:42.010 --> 24:43.978
Tomorrow night?

24:44.010 --> 24:46.001
(scoffs)

24:49.080 --> 24:52.117
Sorry to inconvenience you.

24:52.150 --> 24:55.017
Lana, I really have to go.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.937
Kalinda,
you come here,

25:09.970 --> 25:12.768
and I feel like I'm warming
you up for someone else.

25:13.810 --> 25:16.574
You're not.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.760
Hey.

25:39.800 --> 25:40.835
Hi.

25:40.870 --> 25:41.962
You seem good.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.638
I'm excited
about the case.

25:43.670 --> 25:45.331
Uh, Your Honor,
before we begin, I believe

25:45.370 --> 25:47.235
there's still _
a question of standing.

25:47.270 --> 25:48.430
No, Your Honor, there's
no question of standing.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.278
There is a question of Chumhum's
purchase of Wicked Savage.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.107
Yes, but first there is
a question of standing

25:53.150 --> 25:54.617
being raised
by Chancellor Carlyle.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.049
VVho?
MAN:
Your Honor,
I am the chancellor

25:56.080 --> 25:57.581
of Chicago Polytechnic.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.781
I'm happy for you.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.082
Now, what do you want?

26:01.120 --> 26:02.280
I'm here to assert

26:02.320 --> 26:04.254
the university's
ownership of the software

26:04.290 --> 26:05.257
titled _
Margarita Motions.

26:05.290 --> 26:06.757
What?!

26:06.790 --> 26:07.996
IfI could point

26:08.030 --> 26:10.328
to page 42 of the university's
student handbook:

26:10.360 --> 26:12.362
"The college
owns the right

26:12.400 --> 26:15.062
"to all works, inventions,
developments, and discoveries

26:15.100 --> 26:16.988
created by employees
or students..."

26:17.040 --> 26:18.837
You're kidding--
we invented this.

26:18.870 --> 26:22.271
Yes, but on school property
and using school resources.

26:22.310 --> 26:24.005
There is a legal precedent here,

26:24.050 --> 26:24.971
Your Honor.

26:25.010 --> 26:27.274
Google was forced to
negotiate with Stanford

26:27.310 --> 26:29.346
over the rights to Google,
and the University of Illinois

26:29.380 --> 26:32.816
sued one of the cofounders
of Netscape for trademark

26:32.850 --> 26:33.885
infringement.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.911
Therefore, we ask
that the subpoena be quashed,

26:35.960 --> 26:39.589
given that the plaintiffs'
standing here is unclear.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.697
Just give me a listen.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.197
Uh, I'm on a case, Eli.

26:44.230 --> 26:46.698
It's for Alicia,
not Peter.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.290
Look, Peter is being
accused of sleeping

26:49.340 --> 26:51.399
with a campaign worker,
and he didn't.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.839
I'm just trying
to stop the story

26:52.870 --> 26:54.076
before it embarrasses
AllCla.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.169
Embarrasses Alicia?
Yes.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.905
After all she's been through,
you know it will.

26:59.250 --> 27:02.970
Just listen to the reporter's
questions, that's all.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.241
This is Kalinda,
my assistant.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.314
I asked her to sit in.

27:06.350 --> 27:07.317
Hi.

27:07.350 --> 27:08.988
Really?

27:09.020 --> 27:10.317
I thought we were finishing up.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.681
Oh, no, I'm sorry
ifI gave you that impression.

27:12.730 --> 27:14.357
If you want face time
with Peter and Alicia,

27:14.400 --> 27:15.799
I'll need to_know what
you're g0ing to ask.

27:15.830 --> 27:16.797
His assistant, huh?

27:16.830 --> 27:19.196
(sighs)

27:20.370 --> 27:22.861
Pet_er Florric_k and one
of his campaign workers

27:22.900 --> 27:24.333
slept together
on September 30.

27:24.370 --> 27:25.439
Where?

27:25.470 --> 27:26.437
Eli, we vetted this.

27:26.470 --> 27:27.869
Then what's your worry?

27:27.910 --> 27:29.377
(sighs)

27:29.410 --> 27:30.308
The St. Martin.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.399
Was she visiting him
or he visiting her?

27:32.450 --> 27:33.405
They were both there.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.008
Campaign workers
on one floor,

27:35.050 --> 27:36.711
Peter on another.
And which room
did they go to?

27:36.750 --> 27:39.685
They had a prearranged signal.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.382
She was to go to his floor at
11:30 and knock on his door.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.684
KALINDA: _
On how many occa5ions?

27:45.490 --> 27:47.993
What's her name?

27:48.030 --> 27:49.452
No.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.229
ELI:
Mandy, if it's true...

27:51.270 --> 27:54.899
And if I tell you, you'll have
no reason to buy the magazine.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.204
Get me face time.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.911
Eli told me.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.349
Peter, let's not
do this, please.

28:17.390 --> 28:18.379
It's not true;
I wanted you to know.

28:18.430 --> 28:22.491
Seriously, Peter,
I have had a very long day,

28:22.530 --> 28:23.758
and by the end
of the week,

28:23.800 --> 28:25.199
I will have had
a very long week.

28:25.230 --> 28:28.768
Look, I have a target on my
back, and this is not true.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.933
Do you remember what
you said the first time?

28:34.980 --> 28:36.936
"It's not true."
And that's

28:36.980 --> 28:39.403
exactly why they're
throwing this crap at me--

28:39.450 --> 28:42.078
because my denials
will look like lies.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.111
It's politics.

28:45.220 --> 28:48.155
The problem is, Peter,
I don't give a damn.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.123
WILL:
Good morning, Chancellor.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.525
What's this, Chancellor?

29:00.570 --> 29:03.232
It's my book--
a book I wrote

29:03.270 --> 29:06.239
about ways to improve
education in America.

29:06.270 --> 29:08.204
And what income did you
derive from this book?

29:08.240 --> 29:09.502
In royalties?

29:09.540 --> 29:12.145
I... well,
I don't have the facts

29:12.180 --> 29:13.374
and figures at my fingertips.

29:13.410 --> 29:15.469
I do, actually.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.513
$71,450, mostly
due to students

29:19.550 --> 29:21.450
being required to buy
it as a textbook.

29:21.490 --> 29:24.288
Now, how much of that
money went to the college?

29:24.330 --> 29:27.185
CARLYLE:
How much? You mean,
of the royalties?

29:27.230 --> 29:29.357
I don't know.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.220
Did any portion go
to the college?

29:31.270 --> 29:33.966
I... no.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.561
But you're a college employee,
aren't you, sir?

29:37.600 --> 29:40.398
And the student handbook
here clearly states,

29:40.440 --> 29:42.169
"College owns the
rights to all works,

29:42.210 --> 29:43.234
"inventions, developments,

29:43.280 --> 29:46.477
and discoveries created by
employees and students."

29:46.510 --> 29:48.341
Yes, but that's not
a fair comparison.

29:48.380 --> 29:49.813
I'm the university chancellor.

29:49.850 --> 29:51.317
So the rules don't apply to you?

29:51.350 --> 29:52.942
No, that's not
what I said.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.185
The college is selective in
how it enforces its rules?

29:55.220 --> 29:56.187
Oh, come on.

29:56.220 --> 29:58.529
There is a radical
difference between $71,000

29:58.560 --> 30:01.290
in royalties
and the potential millions

30:01.330 --> 30:02.922
from the plaintiffs'
voice recognition software.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.360
Yes, thank you for prompting
the good chancellor

30:05.400 --> 30:06.594
in how to answer
my question, but...

30:06.630 --> 30:08.439
Objection, Your Honor.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.438
I find this line of question
offensive and irrelevant.

30:10.470 --> 30:15.078
No, it isn't, Ms. Walsh;
it actually isn't.

30:15.110 --> 30:17.533
Please continue, Counselor.

30:17.580 --> 30:20.276
WILL: Thank you,
Your Honor.

30:20.310 --> 30:23.416
Is Mr. Neil Gross a graduate
of your university?

30:23.450 --> 30:24.610
He is
an honored graduate.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.982
And did you know that
his company Chumhum

30:27.020 --> 30:29.909
is worth $86 billion?

30:29.960 --> 30:32.986
Well, even if you didn't
know that, you knew

30:33.030 --> 30:35.419
that he'd given a $50 million
endowment to the university.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.018
Yes.
So...

30:37.060 --> 30:38.823
have you claimed
ownership of Chumhum?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.289
No.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.204
Really?

30:44.240 --> 30:47.403
But you read in his
book that he created

30:47.440 --> 30:50.079
his page-ranking hierarchy
in your computer lab.

30:50.110 --> 30:51.077
MARX:
Okay, that's enough.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.273
I'm ready to rule on standing.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.539
It is my determination that,
due to estoppel by silence

30:57.580 --> 30:59.184
and my general disgust with
the chancellor's tactics...

30:59.220 --> 31:00.346
Excuse me, sir.

31:00.390 --> 31:01.414
Excuse me.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.553
This is my court;
you may go now.

31:03.590 --> 31:04.625
Thank you.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.891
The college has no standing
here, and the interests

31:07.930 --> 31:09.898
of the plaintiffs'
suit holds sway.

31:09.930 --> 31:11.488
Yes!
Yes!

31:11.530 --> 31:12.929
I also find
that Mr. Gross

31:12.970 --> 31:15.530
will open all pertinent
aspects of his algorithm

31:15.570 --> 31:17.663
to scrutiny...
Your Honor, we cannot allow

31:17.700 --> 31:19.634
the algorithm,
as you know...
Yes, you can.

31:19.670 --> 31:22.503
Ms. Walsh, what you cannot do
is hide behind the skirts

31:22.540 --> 31:23.939
of trade secrets indefinitely.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.948
I will appoint
a third party

31:25.980 --> 31:28.346
to peruse all algorithm
documents, in order

31:28.380 --> 31:30.940
to avoid competitive leaking.

31:33.990 --> 31:35.958
Mr. Gardner?

31:35.990 --> 31:36.957
Yes.

31:36.990 --> 31:38.924
I know what you're doing.

31:40.330 --> 31:42.958
Your firm's bankrupt.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.127
You lost my competitor,
Patric Edelstein,

31:45.170 --> 31:47.593
so you're looking
for another big fish.

31:47.630 --> 31:50.531
You know I have a
tendency to buy out

31:50.570 --> 31:54.529
my irritants,
hire firms who sue me,

31:54.580 --> 31:58.141
so this-- just a little
performance piece.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.943
Well, not to toot
our own horn, Mr. Gross,

31:59.980 --> 32:02.016
but there is strategic
advantage in hiring the firm

32:02.050 --> 32:04.939
that used to represent
your competition.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.959
Although we're legally bound
by attorney-client privilege,

32:07.990 --> 32:09.218
we know how
Mr. Edelstein works

32:09.260 --> 32:10.659
and we know how
to beat him.

32:10.690 --> 32:14.649
You're right--
strategically smart--

32:14.700 --> 32:19.490
but, you see, here's the
thing: I don't like you

32:19.530 --> 32:22.636
and I intend to go out of
my way to never hire you.

32:22.670 --> 32:25.707
Nice talking with you.

32:25.740 --> 32:27.059
Look, Mr. Gross,

32:27.110 --> 32:28.975
little advice:

32:29.010 --> 32:30.272
If you're looking
for a good lavwer,

32:30.310 --> 32:31.743
don't go
with who you like.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.577
IfI can irritate you like this,

32:33.610 --> 32:36.340
just think what I can do
to your enemies.

32:37.750 --> 32:40.446
I'm rich enough
not to care.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.164
ELI: There were
12 campaign workers

32:51.200 --> 32:55.034
at the St. Martin,
ten of them female.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.662
Who's that?

32:56.700 --> 32:59.066
Indira Starr,
advance.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.271
And she was
at the hotel?

33:01.310 --> 33:02.299
Yeah, why?

33:02.340 --> 33:04.274
Kalinda, it is not true.

33:04.310 --> 33:07.006
Peter did not sleep with her.

33:07.050 --> 33:09.109
(door opens)
PETER:
i...

33:09.150 --> 33:11.345
I want you to look
at this speech...

33:11.390 --> 33:13.210
Hi, Peter.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.218
ELI: Peter, you know
Kalinda Sharma?

33:15.260 --> 33:17.410
Yes, in the State's
Attorney's Office.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.188
with, uh, Mandy Post.

33:20.230 --> 33:22.289
Excuse me.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.764
Uh, you want the photo?

33:24.800 --> 33:26.267
I'm sorry.
Thanks.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.336
Sure.

33:28.370 --> 33:29.564
(door closes)

33:29.600 --> 33:31.431
You have her on this?

33:31.470 --> 33:32.437
Yeah, Why?

33:32.470 --> 33:34.176
She wants to be on it?

33:34.210 --> 33:35.472
Yeah.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.704
Okay.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.800
Okay.
What do I need
to know here, Peter?

33:39.850 --> 33:41.545
(sighs)

33:41.580 --> 33:43.218
Nothing.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.241
Let's go over this.

33:45.290 --> 33:46.689
VIOLA:
You're reluctant to reveal

33:46.720 --> 33:48.210
the Chumhum algorithm
to the court.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.613
Why is that?

33:49.660 --> 33:50.809
Well, for the obvious reason,

33:50.860 --> 33:52.782
it's our crown jewels.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.718
Other companies would pay
millions for access to it.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.318
VIOLA:
And you're here to tell
the court that you

33:56.360 --> 33:57.395
won't acquiesce
to their subpoena,

33:57.430 --> 33:59.466
is that right?
Yes, but I believe

33:59.500 --> 34:02.196
I have the law on my side.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.195
VIOLA:
Why is that?

34:03.240 --> 34:04.468
The First Amendment.
WILL:
Oh, dear God.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.159
JUDGE MARX:
Mr. Gardner.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.359
Please.

34:07.410 --> 34:08.638
Our search
engine results

34:08.680 --> 34:10.375
are protected by free speech.

34:10.410 --> 34:12.799
To compel their release is the
same as compelling a newspaper

34:12.850 --> 34:14.272
to reveal its sources.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.777
(Will chuckling)

34:16.820 --> 34:19.243
VIOLA:
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.383
Therefore, you have editorial
discretion, Mr. Gross?

34:21.420 --> 34:24.082
Yes, and that is why

34:24.130 --> 34:26.553
I am resisting
this subpoena.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.463
, 1 Z 7;; : ::

34:33.500 --> 34:35.468
Kalinda, hello.
NICK:
Hey.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.637
This must be
yourfnend.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.103
Kalinda is it?

34:38.140 --> 34:39.630
How are you doing?
I'm Nick.

34:39.670 --> 34:42.639
He was just keeping me company.
Thrilling me with his accent.

34:42.680 --> 34:45.342
Oh, I was trying to.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.608
So how do you two
know each other?

34:46.650 --> 34:49.574
Just friends.
Really?

34:49.620 --> 34:51.349
You seem like more.

34:52.850 --> 34:54.818
Well, I don't know.
You seem like, uh,

34:54.860 --> 34:57.658
adopted sisters
or something.

34:57.690 --> 34:59.226
No.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.524
Friends from way back.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.399
Let me get you both a drink.

35:05.430 --> 35:06.761
Fnends.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.791
Sure.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.604
Oh, I've just got
something through.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.529
Sorry. Will you
excuse me, please?

35:16.440 --> 35:19.375
I'm just gonna be one second.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.626
Dyke.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.290
Kevin Costas.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.434
I'm a blogger.

35:42.470 --> 35:44.529
My blog, UberTech, was awarded

35:44.570 --> 35:47.733
one of the Top 25
Tech Blogs of 2010

35:47.770 --> 35:49.499
by Engadget.

35:49.540 --> 35:52.509
Congratulations.
And on your blog you wrote:

35:52.550 --> 35:55.576
"Margarita Motions wasn't
just plagiarized...

35:55.620 --> 35:57.645
it stinks."

35:57.680 --> 35:59.910
Yes.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.508
And how do you know
it was plagiarized?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.959
KEVIN:
How do I know the software was?

36:02.990 --> 36:04.355
Because it was.

36:04.390 --> 36:05.527
'Cause it's not very good.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.256
And you have proof
they stole it?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.359
You mean, actual proof?

36:10.400 --> 36:12.618
No.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.537
But I don't need it.
It's my opinion.

36:15.570 --> 36:16.969
VIOLA:
Objection, Your Honor.
What does this

36:17.000 --> 36:18.262
have to do with the lawsuit?

36:18.310 --> 36:19.504
ALICIA:
Mr. Gross is claiming

36:19.540 --> 36:21.371
editorial discretion
for his search engine,

36:21.410 --> 36:23.571
therefore he is responsible
for its editorial content...

36:23.610 --> 36:25.271
Wait a minute._..
They can't have their cake

36:25.310 --> 36:26.675
and eat it too,
Your Honor.

36:26.710 --> 36:29.508
If they insist
on free speech protections,

36:29.550 --> 36:30.949
then they're responsible
for that speech.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.709
Your Honor...

36:32.750 --> 36:34.650
No, Ms. Walsh, she's right.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.214
Overruled.

36:36.260 --> 36:39.559
So, Mr. Costas, you
printed the accusation

36:39.590 --> 36:41.854
of plagiarism without
checking truth or falsehood?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.390
I didn't need to.

36:43.430 --> 36:44.897
And did Mr. Gross,
or anyone from Chumhum,

36:44.930 --> 36:45.726
ask you for evidence

36:45.770 --> 36:49.399
as to the truth
of your accusation?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.761
Uh... from from Chumhum?

36:51.810 --> 36:54.404
Uh, no.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.237
Judge, this is absurd.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.475
Chumhum has millions
of pages. If my client

36:58.510 --> 37:00.444
is gonna be held liable
for every single one...

37:00.480 --> 37:01.970
Well, then there will be
a hell of a lot

37:02.020 --> 37:04.409
of defamation suits.
Yes, Ms. Walsh.

37:04.450 --> 37:06.680
I'm not making
a free speech argument.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.517
You are.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.913
(sighs)

37:09.960 --> 37:11.427
One million dollars.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.984
But you have to take it now.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.351
No consulting with Will.
No second guessing.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.459
Just business between
two like minds.

37:18.530 --> 37:20.293
No.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.366
We're not going higher.
That's probably true.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.628
(sighs)

37:23.670 --> 37:25.831
It's one million dollars.

37:25.870 --> 37:26.939
This firm is bankrupt.

37:26.970 --> 37:28.471
Then negotiate with Will.
Tell him.

37:28.510 --> 37:30.398
But I'll advise him
not to take it.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.509
Why?

37:31.550 --> 37:34.849
I've seen the evidence.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.474
You're a businessman.
Yes. Show a busmessman

37:37.520 --> 37:41.012
a winning hand, he doesn't need
to be a gambler to go all in.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.881
I'm going all in.

37:45.730 --> 37:48.051
Will has gotten to you.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.490
He's put dollar signs
in your eyes.

37:50.530 --> 37:52.395
I'm trying to be
the peacemaker here.

37:52.430 --> 37:53.624
(laughs)

37:55.740 --> 37:58.300
Why aren't people just upfront
with what they want?

37:58.340 --> 37:59.500
Why don't they ever

37:59.540 --> 38:01.337
just say what they mean?

38:01.380 --> 38:03.507
Well, you have chosen
a really strange time

38:03.540 --> 38:04.609
to get philosophical.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.470
No.

38:06.510 --> 38:08.614
It's the perfect time.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.709
Thank you.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.779
At first I was just...

38:16.820 --> 38:19.050
you know, flirtatious.

38:19.090 --> 38:21.593
Older guys
like to flirt with me.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.655
I have a nice laugh.
And then you two had sex?

38:23.700 --> 38:25.759
Yeah, but it wasn't
a big deal.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.098
I told that reporter, it's
not like I'm some Rielle Hunter.

38:28.130 --> 38:29.893
How many times did you have sex?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.339
Maybe eight times.
I don't know.

38:31.370 --> 38:32.598
Was it always
at a hotel?

38:32.640 --> 38:36.076
No, uh, twice
at his apartment.

38:36.110 --> 38:38.476
Once, we were doing it

38:38.510 --> 38:40.375
in the bedroom and

38:40.410 --> 38:42.412
we heard his wife
coming home.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.042
Yeah, it was like
something out of a movie.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.584
I had to hide
in the bathroom.

38:47.620 --> 38:48.985
She saw me, too.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.351
She saw you?

38:50.390 --> 38:52.028
Alicia saw you?
Yeah, Alicia.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.687
But she said it was
no big deal.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.425
I mean, she's used to it.

38:55.460 --> 38:56.791
I guess he's a real
man whore.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.468
Really?
Oh, yeah.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.489
She was like,

38:59.530 --> 39:00.758
you can do it anywhere
you want,

39:00.800 --> 39:02.461
just not in my apartment.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.968
But you know how it is.

39:05.010 --> 39:05.999
GROSS: _
We are negotiating.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.132
_ ALICIA: _ _
Zero is not a negotiation.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.831
GROSS:
Well, then throw
out some numbers.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.074
ALICIA:
Mr. Gross, settle down.

39:10.110 --> 39:12.544
Sorry we're late.
Where are we at?

39:12.580 --> 39:14.514
We seem to be at zero.

39:14.550 --> 39:16.415
VIOLA:
Well, don't forget,
we've agreed not to sue

39:16.450 --> 39:18.418
for _court costs. _
Stop playing games, Viola.

39:18.450 --> 39:20.680
It's settle or
hand over the algorithm.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.415
Mm... no.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.484
I think there's a third way.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.748
And what's that?

39:27.490 --> 39:30.527
Have you spoken to your clients?

39:30.560 --> 39:31.299
You're right.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.389
I do tend to buy out
my irritants.

39:33.430 --> 39:35.694
Just not their lavwers.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.778
Oh, Alicia, hi.
We were just

39:46.810 --> 39:48.516
leaving a note.

39:50.450 --> 39:51.542
You settled?

39:51.590 --> 39:54.514
Mr. Gross hired us

39:54.560 --> 39:56.585
to run Wicked Savage Designs
for him.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.429
Their voice
recognition software.

39:58.460 --> 39:59.757
What happened to running
your own company?

39:59.790 --> 40:01.496
Things change.

40:01.530 --> 40:02.997
Thank you, Alicia.

40:03.030 --> 40:05.419
You guys were great.
If we ever get in trouble

40:05.470 --> 40:06.494
again, we will

40:06.530 --> 40:08.760
give a call.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.538
(sighs)

40:17.540 --> 40:18.973
(chuckles)

40:22.950 --> 40:25.589
ALICIA:
What do you need, Eli?

40:27.120 --> 40:29.782
Eli?

40:33.530 --> 40:35.498
Do you and Peter
have an open marriage?

40:39.070 --> 40:42.130
(giggling)

40:42.170 --> 40:43.967
I'll take that
as a no.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.159
Take it any way you want.

40:47.210 --> 40:49.075
We interviewed the
campaign worker

40:49.110 --> 40:50.236
who supposedly slept with Peter

40:50.280 --> 40:52.840
and she said _
you have an open marriage.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.916
Well, I can't stop
what Peter says.
No.

40:54.950 --> 40:56.110
She said you told her.

40:56.150 --> 40:58.618
She said you found her

40:58.650 --> 41:00.914
in your apartment
bathroom, hiding,

41:00.950 --> 41:02.759
and you told her not to worry
about sleeping with Peter

41:02.790 --> 41:04.052
because you have
an open marriage...

41:04.090 --> 41:06.558
just so long as it's not at

41:06.590 --> 41:08.922
your apartment.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.190
This is all a lie?

41:12.630 --> 41:14.689
Good. Then that means

41:14.740 --> 41:16.560
this campaign worker isn't
just lying about Peter.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.534
She is also lying about you.

41:18.570 --> 41:20.538
* Can everybody see

41:20.570 --> 41:22.731
* That I'm on fire

41:22.780 --> 41:24.543
* Did they watch you

41:24.580 --> 41:26.639
* Burn this mother down?

41:26.680 --> 41:28.671
* Please don't rescue me

41:28.720 --> 41:32.087
* I'm free to burn
as I please *

41:32.120 --> 41:33.587
* Just leave me be

41:33.620 --> 41:35.508
* Don't put me out..

41:35.560 --> 41:37.619
(laughs)

41:45.230 --> 41:48.222
I don't know what you're
getting on about this.

41:48.270 --> 41:50.591
It isn't that hard.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.605
I know you tried
a lot of things

41:54.640 --> 41:55.709
when I was away,

41:55.740 --> 41:57.901
and I forgive you.

41:59.610 --> 42:01.146
Thanks.

42:01.180 --> 42:02.818
Yep.

42:05.150 --> 42:06.686
But now I'm back.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.711
And I don't want you
doing anymore

42:08.760 --> 42:10.557
of that
college dorm stuff.

42:10.590 --> 42:13.855
No more...
No more women.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.691
Things change.

42:17.730 --> 42:19.163
Some things
don't change.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.020
You belong to me.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.869
I belong to you.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.900
And I_know where
your girlfriend lives.

42:33.980 --> 42:36.244
I'd like to see you try.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.339
I don't think you would.
Oh, I would.

42:38.380 --> 42:41.588
She's a federal agent.

42:41.620 --> 42:43.588
My girlfriend...

42:43.620 --> 42:45.952
is a federal agent.

42:45.990 --> 42:49.619
So good luck with that.

42:49.660 --> 42:51.719
* I don't care if people know

42:51.770 --> 42:54.227
* I don't care
what they'd say... *

42:54.270 --> 42:56.363
Oh, Eli,

42:56.400 --> 42:59.904
are we, are we doing
this speech in Oak Park?

42:59.940 --> 43:01.032
'Cause if we are,

43:01.070 --> 43:04.699
I think the demographic's
all wrong.
