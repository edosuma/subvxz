00:01.859 --> 00:04.750
Why can't I remember?

00:04.786 --> 00:06.372
How are you
feeling today, Cora?

00:06.408 --> 00:10.078
There was this wallpaper like
the design on a dollar bill.

00:10.114 --> 00:11.380
It's on every wall.

00:11.416 --> 00:13.416
You'll be sentenced
in two weeks' time

00:13.452 --> 00:15.250
with no right to appeal.

00:15.286 --> 00:17.052
These proceedings
are concluded.

00:17.088 --> 00:18.553
<i>So we just got the car</i>

00:18.589 --> 00:21.323
<i>that Mason Tannetti
saw at the crime scene.</i>

00:21.359 --> 00:23.592
<i>Reported stolen
last week in Trenton.</i>

00:23.628 --> 00:25.561
Two passengers.

00:25.597 --> 00:27.363
Probably Oxy users.

00:27.399 --> 00:29.531
This girl, she got pregnant.

00:29.567 --> 00:33.134
She wanted to name
the baby Winter.

00:33.170 --> 00:36.171
But JD, he didn't want
to be a father.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.440
Maddie, getting pregnant
doesn't make you matter.

00:38.476 --> 00:40.643
Neither does jumping
in front of a car.

00:40.679 --> 00:43.378
Todd, this is Cora.

00:43.414 --> 00:44.546
Me and him have been
talking about

00:44.582 --> 00:46.381
working on a project together.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.551
- I can't breathe. My heart.
- You're okay.

00:48.587 --> 00:50.418
Everything's okay.
Everything's okay.

00:50.454 --> 00:51.519
No, no, the pill.
They poisoned me.

00:51.555 --> 00:52.854
No, you're just peaking.

00:52.890 --> 00:54.323
Are you coming?

00:54.359 --> 00:56.391
Cora, are you coming?

01:00.465 --> 01:02.298
Hey.
Help me!

01:02.334 --> 01:03.364
Breathe!

01:19.384 --> 01:21.316
It was Phoebe.

01:21.352 --> 01:24.122
It was Phoebe all along.

01:25.356 --> 01:27.256
I tried to take her home.

01:27.292 --> 01:29.224
I knew something
was gonna happen.

01:29.260 --> 01:31.560
I knew it.

01:31.596 --> 01:33.528
It's not your fault.

01:36.233 --> 01:37.366
I should have stopped it.

01:37.402 --> 01:40.371
Cora, it's not your fault.

01:41.506 --> 01:43.272
It wasn't Frankie's
fault either.

01:43.308 --> 01:47.242
He was trying to save her,
but I killed him.

01:54.186 --> 01:56.322
What about
what happened after?

01:57.489 --> 01:59.622
The scars on your arms.

01:59.658 --> 02:02.228
The man with the mask.

02:07.532 --> 02:09.732
I don't know.

02:25.372 --> 02:30.372
Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:40.998 --> 02:43.399
I'm gonna find
a witness who was there.

02:43.435 --> 02:45.768
Now we have a motive,
and you have a defense.

02:45.804 --> 02:49.307
- Okay. Come on.
- You're gonna be okay.

02:59.417 --> 03:02.187
I don't see why
this is necessary.

03:15.467 --> 03:18.633
Was there ever any wallboard
in this room?

03:18.669 --> 03:21.302
- Any wallpaper?
- No.

03:21.338 --> 03:23.741
No, it's been the same
since I started here.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.413
Just saw his wife.

03:32.449 --> 03:36.551
Todd Ritger died two years ago.
Kidney cancer.

03:36.587 --> 03:39.320
Okay. He could still be
our masked man, though, right?

03:39.356 --> 03:42.290
July 5th, two days after
the basement business,

03:42.326 --> 03:44.492
Ritger whisked his wife
off to the Caribbean

03:44.528 --> 03:46.694
to renew their vows.

03:46.730 --> 03:48.530
They stayed a month.

03:48.566 --> 03:50.431
Oh, shit.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.367
Okay.

03:52.403 --> 03:54.336
That's our last chance.

03:54.372 --> 03:56.538
Maybe the two guys
knocked off Lambert

03:56.574 --> 03:58.340
'cause he knew something.

03:58.376 --> 04:01.342
Already on it.
The car was stolen in Trenton,

04:01.378 --> 04:02.745
so I had the tow interchange do

04:02.781 --> 04:05.281
a video match
on the license plate.

04:05.317 --> 04:06.819
Good.

04:12.357 --> 04:14.490
Thanks.

04:14.526 --> 04:16.694
Don't mention it.

04:27.906 --> 04:30.442
Tell me.

04:31.576 --> 04:34.343
Tell me.

04:34.379 --> 04:37.613
I don't remember.

04:37.649 --> 04:40.315
Good girl.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.589
A lot of DNA
in that basement,

04:48.625 --> 04:50.591
none of it Cora Tannetti's.

04:50.627 --> 04:54.463
We did get the DNA match
on the body, though.

04:54.499 --> 04:56.835
It actually is Phoebe Lacey.

04:58.636 --> 05:01.769
That's not enough, but...

05:01.805 --> 05:04.105
we'll find something, though.

05:04.141 --> 05:06.375
Thanks.

05:06.411 --> 05:08.543
Tollbooth got a hit.
Called Albany Vice.

05:08.579 --> 05:11.512
They know the guy on the right:
Daniel Burroughs, aka "Duffy."

05:11.548 --> 05:13.514
- Did you get an address?
- No, but Duffy rented

05:13.550 --> 05:17.519
a 15-passenger van two days ago
on his MileagePlus card.

05:17.555 --> 05:19.555
- Let's put out an APB.
- Yeah.

05:19.591 --> 05:22.328
Did that already too.

05:25.829 --> 05:27.963
<i>Code 5 on a white late-model
multi-passenger van,</i>

05:27.999 --> 05:31.834
<i>license plate 7-Gary-6024.</i>

05:31.870 --> 05:34.670
<i>Vehicle spotted

05:34.706 --> 05:36.939
4-5 is en route.

05:49.721 --> 05:51.586
Suspect has entered
a storefront.

05:51.622 --> 05:55.461
The sign outside says
"American Medical Clinic."

06:01.533 --> 06:04.432
- Is he still in there?
- Yes, sir.

06:04.468 --> 06:05.800
I'm not sure what's going on.

06:05.836 --> 06:07.538
I'm waiting for backup.

06:24.689 --> 06:26.855
God damn it.

06:51.615 --> 06:53.649
Hey, this is a private
business. You got to leave.

06:53.685 --> 06:56.485
Okay.

06:56.521 --> 06:57.952
What kind of business
you got here?

06:57.988 --> 07:01.055
Dude, I just said get
the hell out of here.

07:01.091 --> 07:04.660
All right, ladies,
the bus is leaving.

07:04.696 --> 07:06.799
Duffy?

07:08.833 --> 07:10.565
Daniel Burroughs?

07:25.850 --> 07:27.081
Suspect's down!

07:27.117 --> 07:29.050
Go to your left!
Go to your left!

07:29.086 --> 07:30.252
Secure the clinic!

07:30.288 --> 07:31.490
I got it!
I got it!

07:36.593 --> 07:38.493
Clear here!

07:38.529 --> 07:40.495
Clear over here.

07:40.531 --> 07:42.764
Dispatch,
we've got shots fired,

07:42.800 --> 07:45.471
Broadway and Division.

07:53.505 --> 07:56.983
So you take the girls
to the clinics,

07:57.019 --> 07:58.062
they get their prescriptions,

07:58.098 --> 07:59.935
then you drive them
to the pharmacies?

07:59.971 --> 08:02.075
And they get 50 bucks
and we get the bottle.

08:02.111 --> 08:04.178
- Who writes the scrips?
- JD.

08:04.214 --> 08:06.600
He's the one
with the license number.

08:06.636 --> 08:09.816
- So why kill him?
- I didn't kill anybody.

08:09.852 --> 08:11.638
That was Duffy.

08:11.674 --> 08:13.721
He got nervous.

08:13.757 --> 08:15.570
JD being picked up

08:15.606 --> 08:17.560
and then his woman
getting busted,

08:17.596 --> 08:19.726
he thought JD was gonna use him
as a bargaining chip.

08:19.762 --> 08:21.445
All right. And then, so...

08:21.481 --> 08:22.700
He's lying.

08:24.969 --> 08:26.099
Who hired you?

08:26.135 --> 08:27.925
- What?
- To kill JD.

08:27.961 --> 08:29.170
Look, I told you
I didn't kill him.

08:29.206 --> 08:30.939
Was it somebody
at the Beverwyck Club?

08:30.975 --> 08:33.111
- The what club?
- Harry.

08:34.211 --> 08:36.114
We're done.

08:47.578 --> 08:51.387
You get any leads on
Cora Tannetti from our suspect?

08:51.423 --> 08:54.697
Nope.
Three doctors.

08:54.733 --> 08:57.230
California,
Texas, Ohio.

08:57.266 --> 09:01.171
Each defrauded of their license
number in the past month.

09:03.601 --> 09:05.810
That's it.

09:07.244 --> 09:09.877
Well, you busted
a local opioid ring,

09:09.913 --> 09:14.085
so that's something
to be proud of on a Tuesday.

09:15.019 --> 09:17.408
Look, I'm sorry

09:17.444 --> 09:20.158
the Tannetti angle
didn't work out.

09:22.647 --> 09:24.892
It was still good police work.

09:24.928 --> 09:27.765
There's a connection there.

09:29.132 --> 09:31.234
Has to be.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.041
I'm still looking.

09:40.077 --> 09:41.975
It's just I thought

09:42.011 --> 09:44.979
that those two guys
were gonna be the missing piece,

09:45.015 --> 09:46.985
but they weren't.

09:50.087 --> 09:52.152
And I...

09:52.188 --> 09:53.820
let's just go
through it all again,

09:53.856 --> 09:56.159
and something will come up,
I'm sure.

09:58.062 --> 10:00.427
Why can't we
just tell Judge Baird

10:00.463 --> 10:03.131
what happened to me?

10:03.167 --> 10:04.898
You need a witness,

10:04.934 --> 10:08.201
or your story doesn't hold up.

10:08.237 --> 10:10.805
My sentencing is tomorrow.

10:10.841 --> 10:13.010
I know.

10:16.013 --> 10:18.278
I'm sorry.

10:29.393 --> 10:31.926
Tannetti!

10:31.962 --> 10:34.061
Visitor.

10:52.049 --> 10:54.351
I didn't think
you would come.

10:59.088 --> 11:01.922
Your father convinced me.

11:04.428 --> 11:07.265
I want to tell you
what happened to Phoebe.

11:10.033 --> 11:11.903
So?

11:13.136 --> 11:17.140
I took her out that night,
and I don't regret it...

11:18.408 --> 11:20.874
Because...

11:20.910 --> 11:22.977
she met a boy,

11:23.013 --> 11:25.445
and she fell in love.

11:25.481 --> 11:29.120
They danced,
they had sex...

11:30.319 --> 11:32.954
And she died in his arms,

11:32.990 --> 11:36.094
exactly the way
that she wanted.

11:36.927 --> 11:38.926
You're disgusting.

11:38.962 --> 11:41.362
I've never seen her happier
than that night.

11:41.398 --> 11:44.532
Phoebe was buried
in the woods,

11:44.568 --> 11:47.067
in the dirt, alone.

11:47.103 --> 11:49.372
Was that what she wanted?

11:51.207 --> 11:52.406
Why didn't you
call the police

11:52.442 --> 11:54.312
when we didn't come home?

11:55.245 --> 11:57.979
Why didn't you look for us?

11:58.015 --> 12:00.413
We thought you ran away.

12:00.449 --> 12:03.283
You think I didn't hear you
whispering about Florida?

12:03.319 --> 12:06.287
Planning your escape,
like I was some sort of monster?

12:06.323 --> 12:09.327
Turning Phoebe against me?

12:11.294 --> 12:15.229
We just wanted to live.

12:15.265 --> 12:17.364
That's all it was.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.032
And look at you now.

12:19.068 --> 12:21.104
Just look what
you've done to yourself.

12:24.274 --> 12:27.477
I'm more free now
than I ever was with you.

12:36.419 --> 12:38.552
Cora Tannetti murdered
a perfect stranger

12:38.588 --> 12:40.054
without provocation.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.489
We see no need not to prosecute

12:42.525 --> 12:45.026
to the fullest extent
of the law.

12:45.062 --> 12:46.359
Ms. Hutchins,
does your client

12:46.395 --> 12:48.028
wish to address the court?

12:48.064 --> 12:50.034
No, your honor.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.471
I would give anything to go
back to that day on the beach

12:58.507 --> 13:00.210
and undo all of this.

13:10.254 --> 13:13.324
I'm sorry that I took
your son from you.

13:15.324 --> 13:17.395
I am not a killer.

13:19.328 --> 13:21.598
That is not who I am.

13:28.538 --> 13:32.639
But somebody took my sister
and buried her in the woods,

13:32.675 --> 13:36.243
and they kept me
in a room for months,

13:36.279 --> 13:38.045
and I don't even know
what they did to me,

13:38.081 --> 13:40.013
- and they're out there.
- Mrs. Tannetti.

13:40.049 --> 13:42.249
They are still out there.

13:42.285 --> 13:46.119
Mrs. Tannetti, I realize that
this is an emotional moment,

13:46.155 --> 13:48.355
but you've waived
your right to a trial.

13:48.391 --> 13:51.658
I'm sorry. I can't consider
your defense here.

14:01.605 --> 14:03.403
While the defendant
has pled guilty

14:03.439 --> 14:05.672
and shows remorse
for her crime,

14:05.708 --> 14:09.210
a realistic course for her
rehabilitation is unclear.

14:09.246 --> 14:12.580
In order to effectuate justice
for the victim and his family,

14:12.616 --> 14:14.282
I hereby sentence
the defendant,

14:14.318 --> 14:16.117
Cora Elizabeth Tannetti,

14:16.153 --> 14:18.652
to be remanded to
the Department of Corrections

14:18.688 --> 14:21.489
for a minimum sentence
of 30 years.

14:25.462 --> 14:28.128
That concludes
these proceedings.

14:28.164 --> 14:30.564
All rise.

16:00.733 --> 16:02.264
Harry.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.201
Yeah.

16:04.237 --> 16:07.370
Why don't you come over
and have dinner with us tonight?

16:07.406 --> 16:09.972
Working on my osso buco.

16:10.008 --> 16:13.242
No, thanks.
I'm good.

16:13.278 --> 16:15.845
You go ahead.

16:24.456 --> 16:28.692
This is the fourth goddamn
barbecue they've stolen.

16:28.728 --> 16:30.860
- Who's "they"?
- Junkies!

16:30.896 --> 16:32.995
How do you know
they're junkies?

16:33.031 --> 16:35.698
Because who else would steal
a friggin' barbecue

16:35.734 --> 16:37.333
four times in a row?

16:37.369 --> 16:39.001
Can you describe
your barbecue for me, sir?

16:39.037 --> 16:41.837
Yeah.
It's a Napoleon.

16:41.873 --> 16:44.640
Stainless steel
with a side burner.

16:44.676 --> 16:45.942
Side burner.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.653
Brenda, you got a visitor.

17:02.027 --> 17:03.727
Hey.

17:03.763 --> 17:06.233
Hey, honey.

17:07.432 --> 17:09.766
Hey, baby.

17:09.801 --> 17:12.434
You're so big.

17:23.715 --> 17:26.281
Keep your hands on
the table.

17:26.318 --> 17:28.287
There you are.

17:29.488 --> 17:32.756
Okay,
I could do that sideways.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.391
You can do whatever you want.

17:34.427 --> 17:38.028
I cannot get enough to...
watch this.

17:38.064 --> 17:41.064
His teacher said that he's
doing really good in school now.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.798
- Yeah?
- That his spelling is good.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.800
His handwriting is good.

17:44.836 --> 17:46.435
He doesn't really like
listening to authority...

17:47.955 --> 17:49.939
Which I thought sounded
kind of familiar.

17:51.977 --> 17:53.947
- Again.
- It's okay.

17:57.415 --> 18:00.886
Is it a good idea
to be bringing him here?

18:01.754 --> 18:02.919
And I just don't want
to hurt him

18:02.955 --> 18:05.954
any more than I already have.

18:05.990 --> 18:07.493
No, it's a good idea.

18:09.828 --> 18:11.897
He needs his mom.

18:12.864 --> 18:16.499
But if it's easier
to move on...

18:16.535 --> 18:19.805
for him, for both of you.

18:21.006 --> 18:22.971
We're gonna come back
next week,

18:23.007 --> 18:25.344
and every Thursday after that.

18:26.911 --> 18:29.783
That's what we're gonna do.

18:31.549 --> 18:33.982
Okay?

19:41.219 --> 19:45.087
Miss Beecham, I'm Detective
Lieutenant Harry Ambrose.

19:45.123 --> 19:48.525
This must be Winter.

19:48.561 --> 19:51.528
- I'm not Miss Beecham anymore.
- Maddie Beecham?

19:51.564 --> 19:53.997
You're a hard woman to find.

19:54.033 --> 19:56.833
But there's only one
other baby named Winter

19:56.869 --> 19:58.535
on the birth registry.

19:58.571 --> 20:02.605
It's up in Buffalo,
so I thought I'd try here first.

20:04.209 --> 20:06.446
Can I help you?

20:07.880 --> 20:12.048
You know we opened
a missing persons file on you.

20:12.084 --> 20:15.020
Can I ask you why you left
and changed your name?

20:20.124 --> 20:23.092
I was in a toxic
relationship.

20:23.128 --> 20:25.432
JD Lambert.

20:26.265 --> 20:28.131
You were at the Beverwyck Club

20:28.167 --> 20:32.205
on July 3rd, 2012, Miss Beecham?

20:34.006 --> 20:35.471
You were there
with Cora Lacey

20:35.507 --> 20:37.906
and her sister, Phoebe.

20:37.942 --> 20:40.042
What do you remember
about that night?

20:40.078 --> 20:41.911
JD and I had a fight,

20:41.947 --> 20:44.247
and I left before everyone else.

20:44.283 --> 20:47.115
I got on a bus the next morning
to my cousin's,

20:47.151 --> 20:50.086
to Vermont.

20:50.122 --> 20:52.459
I had to get away from him.

20:54.692 --> 20:58.560
Did you ever hear from JD
after that night?

20:58.596 --> 21:01.029
He...

21:01.065 --> 21:03.635
he wouldn't stop calling.

21:04.236 --> 21:06.735
He threatened me,

21:06.771 --> 21:09.672
said that he would find me,

21:09.708 --> 21:12.608
and then he apologized and...

21:12.644 --> 21:16.648
asked me to be part
of a new business opportunity.

21:18.116 --> 21:20.148
What kind of opportunity?

21:22.086 --> 21:24.923
He was selling oxy.

21:25.690 --> 21:28.156
JD's selling pills.

21:31.630 --> 21:33.695
It started after that night?

21:49.538 --> 21:50.947
<i>Hello.
Doctor's office.</i>

21:50.983 --> 21:53.283
- Dr. Strauss, please.
- <i>Who's calling?</i>

21:53.319 --> 21:56.369
Detective Ambrose,
from Dorchester, New York.

21:56.405 --> 21:58.974
- <i>Let me see if he's available.</i>
- Thank you.

22:07.466 --> 22:08.866
Thank you.

22:08.902 --> 22:10.037
Thanks, Your Honor.

22:12.486 --> 22:13.821
Hello, Harry.

23:12.098 --> 23:14.931
I hope you recognize
this place.

23:14.967 --> 23:16.800
I have a right
to call my lawyer.

23:16.836 --> 23:18.936
Sir, we're asking
you step outside.

23:18.972 --> 23:21.004
No.
I won't step outs...

23:26.846 --> 23:29.946
It's okay.
Go ahead.

23:29.982 --> 23:32.720
Take a look around.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.205
- Hello.
- <i>Dad?</i>

26:24.241 --> 26:26.073
<i>You gotta help me
with something.</i>

26:26.109 --> 26:27.775
<i>Something terrible
has happened.</i>

26:27.811 --> 26:28.842
Where are you?

26:28.878 --> 26:30.044
<i>I'm at the Beverwyck.</i>

26:31.281 --> 26:33.180
What?

26:33.216 --> 26:37.819
Yeah, no, no... hold on.
I'll be right there.

26:37.855 --> 26:39.920
What's wrong?

26:55.306 --> 26:57.275
Frankie?

26:58.876 --> 27:00.845
Dad.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.978
Are you all right?

27:05.014 --> 27:06.917
It wasn't my fault.

27:10.887 --> 27:14.121
- What happened?
- I don't know.

27:14.157 --> 27:17.058
She had, like, a heart attack.

27:17.094 --> 27:20.794
I tried to do CPR,
but she just...

27:20.830 --> 27:22.900
broke.

27:25.368 --> 27:27.334
This girl has a pulse.

27:27.370 --> 27:29.303
Yeah, she freaked out.

27:29.339 --> 27:32.173
She attacked Frankie,
she attacked me.

27:32.209 --> 27:34.876
- Who is this?
- JD.

27:34.912 --> 27:37.946
He's a... he's a friend.

27:37.982 --> 27:39.813
We have to get her
to the hospital.

27:39.849 --> 27:41.081
Frankie, they're gonna
tell the police.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.883
- It was an accident.
- Yeah?

27:42.919 --> 27:44.886
You want to try
to convince them of that?

27:44.922 --> 27:47.254
You go to the police, I'm gonna
tell them exactly what happened.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.784
- And what is that?
- That your son was balls-deep

27:49.820 --> 27:51.469
in this very sick girl,

27:51.505 --> 27:53.927
both of them high on pills,
when she died.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.863
Now, maybe that's an accident.
Maybe not.

27:55.899 --> 27:58.268
All I know is
it doesn't look good.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.438
Frankie, go home.

28:04.474 --> 28:07.074
Take your car
and drive straight home.

28:07.110 --> 28:10.214
- What are you gonna do?
- Go! Just go!

28:13.216 --> 28:14.953
Go.

28:54.390 --> 28:56.123
All right,
that's good enough.

29:08.271 --> 29:09.937
Now get out of here.
I'll take care of the rest.

29:09.973 --> 29:12.564
Whatever you say, man.

29:52.790 --> 29:55.008
- I want her out of this house.
- We can't do that.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.692
You can drop her
at the hospital.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.728
You want to talk to
the police about last night?

29:58.764 --> 30:01.434
Well then what the hell
do you intend to do with her?

30:03.634 --> 30:05.410
Oh, my God.

30:05.446 --> 30:09.450
Don't look at this.
The less you know, the better.

30:10.217 --> 30:12.549
- Get him ready.
- Ready for what?

30:12.585 --> 30:14.385
You're flying back
to L.A. today.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.948
Come on.
Let's get you in the shower.

30:16.984 --> 30:17.986
Come on.

30:30.571 --> 30:32.336
How are you feeling today?

30:34.440 --> 30:36.574
Cora, easy.

30:36.610 --> 30:39.277
It's okay.

30:39.313 --> 30:42.180
Shh.

31:26.692 --> 31:27.657
What the hell
are you doing here?

31:27.693 --> 31:29.426
I'm just checking in,

31:29.462 --> 31:32.499
make sure everything
was good on your end.

31:33.834 --> 31:36.737
And wanted
to ask you something.

31:38.372 --> 31:40.337
A favor.

31:40.373 --> 31:42.306
- <i>Is sending...</i>
- <i>His restaurant, Ink,</i>

31:42.342 --> 31:45.209
<i>Michael Voltaggio
finds the debate hypocritical.</i>

31:45.245 --> 31:47.310
<i>Weather is making news
tonight...</i>

31:47.346 --> 31:49.346
- Still nothing?
- No.

31:49.382 --> 31:50.615
<i>Of the president.</i>

31:50.651 --> 31:52.517
Poor girl.

31:52.553 --> 31:54.484
Her poor parents.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.587
Once she's healed,

31:56.623 --> 32:00.558
I'll drop her somewhere.

32:00.594 --> 32:02.559
Maybe she won't remember.

32:02.595 --> 32:04.394
<i>Military's oldest medal...</i>

32:04.430 --> 32:06.200
What if she does?

32:15.475 --> 32:17.607
Ow!

32:24.351 --> 32:25.750
Ow.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.631
Tell me what you remember.

32:42.768 --> 32:45.368
Please.

32:45.404 --> 32:47.672
Tell me what you remember.

33:03.623 --> 33:05.722
You all right?

33:09.796 --> 33:11.632
Where am I?

33:16.150 --> 33:18.202
Those stolen license numbers,

33:18.238 --> 33:20.939
they were all from colleagues
of Dr. Belmont.

33:20.975 --> 33:24.446
JD was blackmailing him
all along.

33:53.107 --> 33:55.177
It was you.

34:00.523 --> 34:02.793
I remember your eyes.

34:11.166 --> 34:13.967
I know you did it for your son.

34:24.547 --> 34:27.848
I'm... I'm so sorry.

34:42.931 --> 34:45.568
It's okay. I got her.
Thanks.

35:06.222 --> 35:11.023
You know, when I first
interviewed you at the station,

35:11.059 --> 35:13.929
the way you were
blaming yourself...

35:15.164 --> 35:18.902
I realized it felt familiar...

35:23.639 --> 35:26.076
Because I do that too.

35:37.085 --> 35:40.219
But the thing is, you're...

35:40.255 --> 35:44.324
what somebody did to us
when we were young,

35:44.360 --> 35:47.326
I know it wasn't our fault.

35:47.362 --> 35:50.966
I know we didn't
do anything wrong.

35:58.106 --> 36:00.110
But somehow, I...

36:04.313 --> 36:07.079
I don't know
what to do with it all.

36:22.841 --> 36:25.310
<i>And he leaves her in
a back alley in Poughkeepsie</i>

36:25.346 --> 36:28.000
as if she were a bag of trash.

36:28.036 --> 36:31.392
From that moment forward,
Cora goes through life believing

36:31.428 --> 36:33.873
not only that she
is a heroin addict,

36:33.909 --> 36:37.177
but that she's responsible
for her sister's death.

36:37.213 --> 36:40.380
Despite all of this,
despite all of the abuse

36:40.416 --> 36:43.116
by Patrick Belmont,
by JD Lambert,

36:43.152 --> 36:45.652
by her own family,

36:45.688 --> 36:48.087
does she give up?

36:48.123 --> 36:51.056
No.
No.

36:51.092 --> 36:53.393
She gets clean,

36:53.429 --> 36:55.128
she gets married,

36:55.164 --> 36:57.130
she has a beautiful son,

36:57.166 --> 36:58.697
she lives a normal life,

36:58.733 --> 37:01.331
free of violence,
free of her past,

37:01.367 --> 37:04.938
until one happy day
at the beach with her family,

37:04.974 --> 37:07.560
she sees Frankie Belmont
sitting on the towel

37:07.596 --> 37:10.210
next to hers.

37:10.246 --> 37:13.115
And that's when it all
comes rushing back.

37:16.351 --> 37:19.571
This is a unique moment
in my time

37:19.607 --> 37:21.790
in this privileged position.

37:21.826 --> 37:23.156
Given this new evidence,

37:23.192 --> 37:25.353
I find that the defendant,
Cora Tannetti,

37:25.389 --> 37:29.695
acted under the influence of
extreme emotional disturbance.

37:29.731 --> 37:33.404
I hereby reduce the conviction
from murder in the second degree

37:33.440 --> 37:36.036
to manslaughter
in the first degree,

37:36.072 --> 37:38.170
and rather than spend
another day in prison,

37:38.206 --> 37:40.974
I hereby order Mrs. Tannetti
to be transferred

37:41.010 --> 37:43.308
to a secure
psychiatric facility.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.328
Her case will be reviewed
every two years

37:45.364 --> 37:47.781
with the possibility of release
if she's determined

37:47.817 --> 37:50.784
no longer to be a danger
to herself or others.

37:50.820 --> 37:53.719
Please rise.

38:21.349 --> 38:24.386
- What?
- Proud of you.

38:48.277 --> 38:50.409
You look happy...

38:50.445 --> 38:52.815
maybe.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.086
Yeah.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.487
Two years, I bet,
and you're out.

39:01.523 --> 39:03.822
I'll check in on you
from time to time,

39:03.858 --> 39:06.061
make sure they're
treating you right.

39:09.297 --> 39:12.367
It's gonna be okay.

39:17.273 --> 39:19.108
Thank you.

39:21.876 --> 39:24.213
Mm-hmm.

40:33.916 --> 40:35.882
<i>We're very pleased
with the ruling.</i>

40:35.918 --> 40:37.951
<i>The court recognized
that Mrs. Tannetti's actions</i>

40:37.987 --> 40:39.451
were not with intent to harm,

40:39.487 --> 40:41.621
but the result of
psychological trauma.

40:41.657 --> 40:44.224
We'll be making sure that
she is given adequate care

40:44.260 --> 40:45.625
and is released
as soon as possible.

40:47.496 --> 40:49.161
We would like to give
the Tannetti family

40:49.197 --> 40:50.395
appropriate space and time

40:50.431 --> 40:52.232
to process these developments.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.634
No further comment.
