[Jefferson] <i>Previously on</i>
Black Lightning...

00:10.760 --> 00:13.263
[Lynn] I left the formula
for the meta-boost serum in Markovia.

00:13.346 --> 00:17.225
What happens if Gravedigger
can have any meta power he wants?

00:17.308 --> 00:18.393
<i>He'd be unstoppable.</i>

00:18.476 --> 00:20.061
War is coming to Freeland.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.563
<i>Take this peace offering.</i>

00:21.646 --> 00:26.025
<i>Use it to burn down</i>
<i>the ASA for what they did to my city.</i>

00:26.109 --> 00:28.445
Gravedigger is en route
with a battalion of troops.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.988
The powers that be have decided

00:30.071 --> 00:32.323
that they would rather nuke Freeland
than let Gravedigger win.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.326
The government is gonna bomb Freeland
if we don't beat Gravedigger?

00:35.410 --> 00:38.621
[Lynn] <i>The DNA sample I took</i>
<i>from Gravedigger matches your DNA.</i>

00:39.122 --> 00:40.248
Gravedigger's your great-uncle.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.126
[Gambi] Gravedigger's at the perimeter.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.335
Where's Jennifer?

00:44.419 --> 00:45.587
[Lynn] Jen?

00:46.629 --> 00:47.464
[explosion]

00:49.799 --> 00:50.633
[Jennifer screams]

00:53.845 --> 00:55.597
I got a bogie at nine o'clock.
What is that?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.931
[Gambi] That's Jen!

00:58.516 --> 00:59.601
[Jefferson] Gambi, she's alive!

00:59.684 --> 01:00.977
Good for her.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.266
You coming all hard. [chuckles]

01:41.267 --> 01:42.143
Hold up.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.145

01:49.692 --> 01:51.236
That's Baby Lightning!

01:52.195 --> 01:53.988
Hmm, that's why you mad, huh?

01:54.572 --> 01:55.448
Come on.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.160

02:15.927 --> 02:16.761
[exhales]

02:17.595 --> 02:20.431
What you can do...
you do for blood, right?

02:21.474 --> 02:23.852
-You and I are blood.
-That's funny.

Police and fire stations

Citizens are being shot down in the street

02:40.243 --> 02:42.787
Is Black Lightning
the only line of defense?

02:42.871 --> 02:44.956
Has the government abandoned Freeland?

02:45.707 --> 02:48.376
I'm Jamillah Olsen reporting live
from Mark--

-Now.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.637
[soldiers muttering indistinctly]

03:06.311 --> 03:07.478
[Jefferson] Let's stop the madness.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.815
All right, we're family.
We can work it out.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.192
Man, stop. We ain't related.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.235
No?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.030
Why am I a stable meta like you?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.741
I know you were born out of wedlock.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.285
You father's name was Cassius.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.786
You got that from the ASA.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.414
I know you only met
your half-brother twice.

03:27.290 --> 03:31.210
Once when you were young and once
right before you both went off to war.

03:33.212 --> 03:36.591
His name was Ben. He's my grandfather.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.386
[exhales]

03:41.429 --> 03:45.225
Look here, kinfolk, you ain't gonna
talk your way out of this one.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.687
I'm on a mission...
and I'm gonna complete it.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.898
So you can surrender now.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.819
You'll be treated nicely,
just like your baby girl.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.406
Where is she?

04:00.490 --> 04:01.324
Uh-uh.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.159
She's a prisoner of war.

04:03.993 --> 04:04.994
Where is she?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.288
I'm giving you one last chance
to surrender, boy.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.090
Yeah, you feel that?
Those are microwaves...

04:18.216 --> 04:19.634
cooking you from the inside.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.219
That's it.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.763
Nothing to be ashamed about.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.014
[groaning]

04:25.098 --> 04:26.266
[Gravedigger] You fought well.

04:26.891 --> 04:27.892

05:32.290 --> 05:35.335
<i>Thunder's on her way to help you</i>

05:36.002 --> 05:37.545
-Copy.
-Grayle, what's up?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.464
We have to prep to move.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.424
Okay, let's do it.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.975
Katie, are you still
jamming all transmissions?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.311
[Katie over speakers] <i>Yes.</i>
<i>This video will go unseen.</i>

05:53.394 --> 05:57.815
Sir, without our perimeter barrier,
Markovian forces will overrun the city.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.818
First will come a shock and awe strike
to disrupt everything,

06:01.319 --> 06:02.945
then they'll secure an exfiltration route.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.783
While the elite Markovian Rangers recon
the city to locate Freeland's metas.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.202
No longer our problem.
We're pulling out of Freeland.

06:11.120 --> 06:15.666
Commander, leave nothing
classified behind. I want total closure.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.043
Yes, sir.

06:17.126 --> 06:21.798
Major, find the briefcase,
bring it to me or destroy it.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.216
Yes, sir

06:30.139 --> 06:32.600
Did I stutter?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.500
Gambi, I need you.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.003
-I'm here.
-The Markovians took Jen.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.797
I need you to find out
where they took her.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.841
I'm on it.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.141
Odell isn't at the Pit.
He must be at a safe house somewhere.

07:13.808 --> 07:18.062
Okay. Okay, uh, I'll start talking
to the cameras around the city.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.772
-I'll find him.
-Thanks.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.899
I need to concentrate on
using the ASA's system

07:21.983 --> 07:23.484
to search for Lightning's
energy signature.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.778
-Copy you.
-Come on.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.046
[Gravedigger] It's not gonna work.

07:47.925 --> 07:51.220
My name is Tyson Sykes.
I'm in command here.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.974
And the first thing you need to understand
is I'm not your enemy.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.894
You could have fooled me with the whole
kidnapping and invasion thing.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.145
[scoffs]

07:59.228 --> 08:03.483
Actions made necessary by the continuing
treachery of the US government.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.986
I have been empowered
by the nation of Markovia

08:07.069 --> 08:11.741
to establish an independent
metahuman state inside their borders.

08:11.824 --> 08:16.287
A place where metahumans
can be free, live normal lives.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.373
Mmm-mmm, you need to sell
that trash somewhere else.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.002
Trash?

08:25.004 --> 08:29.759
Little girl, you don't know
a damn thing about this country.

08:31.052 --> 08:35.890
This country was built by
and for rich white men.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.100
That's never gonna change.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.352
There's been plenty of change.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.604
And not enough, sure,
but it's disrespectful

08:41.687 --> 08:44.148
to the sacrifices of our ancestors
to say there's been none.

08:44.232 --> 08:48.486
"Change." You mean Obama
and Martin Luther King?

08:49.362 --> 08:53.115
Well, seems to me that
Obama was bought and paid for

08:53.199 --> 08:56.327
by rich liberals
and multi-national corporations.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.121
And Martin Luther King, well,
he was a coward

08:59.205 --> 09:01.332
who lacked the courage
to fight for his own freedom.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.375
Are you insane?

09:02.458 --> 09:05.670
MLK was one of the most courageous people
to walk the face of this earth.

09:05.753 --> 09:09.423
Not by fighting but by purposefully
putting himself in harm's way.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.176
The moral authority of his cause
couldn't be debated.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.096
-Yeah, they debated that plenty.
-But he was on the right side of history.

09:15.179 --> 09:19.517
Metas are with you or else?
That's not independence or peace.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.519
Who are you to judge me, huh?

09:22.853 --> 09:25.690
You've been on this planet
for the blink of an eye.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.151
I'm 100 years old.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.862
Maybe that's why
you're so negative and grouchy.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.949
I ought to kill you where you stand.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.786
Well, why don't you let me out of here?
Try it.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.498
Maybe later.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.416
[scoffs]

09:45.459 --> 09:47.587
Is this moment in black history over?

10:49.148 --> 10:53.736
What assurance do I have that the ASA
will honor its side of the deal?

10:53.819 --> 10:55.321
Above my paygrade.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.865
Do you have something for me or not?

10:57.948 --> 11:00.368
Suppose I'll have to trust you.

11:02.328 --> 11:07.041
Or I could wash my hands
in your blood if you double-cross me.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.756
The briefcase is at Gambi's tailor shop.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.217
The tailor who came back from the dead?

11:16.300 --> 11:17.301
Hmm.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.511
[Major Grey] Who does he work for?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.137
No one.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.140
Piece of cake. We'll be in touch.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.393
Prepare for relocation to Gotham City.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.687
You'll receive your seat
on the Shadow Board there.

11:28.771 --> 11:33.025
Gotham? Wait a minute,
you're going to nuke Freeland...

11:33.776 --> 11:39.698
if the Markovians take it,
and I just became a loose end.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.493
[grunting]

11:48.457 --> 11:49.875
You'll never get out of here alive!

11:56.424 --> 12:01.345
[breathing heavily] Des... Destiny?
Call... call Lala.

12:01.429 --> 12:06.308
Call Lala,
tell him that I just got from the ASA

12:06.392 --> 12:12.022
that we won't have a Freeland
if the Markovians succeed.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.905
Good morning, Nurse Judas.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.619

[Tobias chuckling]

12:26.662 --> 12:27.496
[clicks tongue]

12:31.625 --> 12:35.171
Of course a loser like you is still living
at home with his parents in his 40s.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.173
Oh, my God, what did you do with them?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.883
Your mom will be just fine...

12:39.758 --> 12:43.262
as long as you take me to where
they're keeping the Markovian metas.

12:45.639 --> 12:48.309
-What about my father?
-Ah, yes.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.019
The Blackovian.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.938
I assure you he died well.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.738
[beeping]

13:03.324 --> 13:04.533
We sure this is where Jen is?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.911
Not completely.
Her energy signature's vanished.

13:06.994 --> 13:10.664
But I've picked up an energy signature
similar to the ASA's meta collars.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.876
It's there, in the middle of where
the Markovian battalion has made camp.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.462
-That has to be it.
-[Brandon] What has to be it?

13:17.213 --> 13:18.047
[Gambi] You need him.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.591
You'll never get Jen out alive
past a hundred Markovian troops.

13:20.674 --> 13:24.553
I know what I said before,
but if Jen needs help, then I'm there.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.430
What's the plan?

13:28.307 --> 13:29.266
[TC groans]

13:29.850 --> 13:30.893
[Gambi] TC!

13:33.979 --> 13:34.897
[Brandon] What's wrong with him?

13:34.980 --> 13:38.108
Probably ASA countermeasures.
We were trying to trace Odell.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.069
Well, the ASA had him in a pod.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.279
You best believe Odell
knows how to deal with his powers.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.239
Is he gonna be okay?

13:43.822 --> 13:45.449
-I think so.
-[cell phone chimes]

13:51.163 --> 13:53.958
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, just a glitch.

13:54.041 --> 13:57.461
Thought someone was opening up
my front door. All good.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.547
Let's go get Jen.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.844
[grunting]

14:10.140 --> 14:11.350
[Dr. Jace] Oh, thank God.

14:12.226 --> 14:16.605
I presume I'm being tracked
and Odell wants you to break me out?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.984
My orders are to clean out
the classified information in Freeland.

14:21.986 --> 14:22.820
[grunts]

14:38.752 --> 14:40.546
[indistinct chatter]

14:41.255 --> 14:42.715
All right, keep moving, everybody.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.842
Go, go, go. You'll be safe inside.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.012
-Go. Keep moving.
-[man] Hey, Henderson.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.056
That's a lot of bad guys, bro.
What are we gonna do?

14:53.350 --> 14:55.811
We're gonna fight through this.
Everybody, fight!

14:55.895 --> 14:57.396
[indistinct chatter]

15:00.357 --> 15:01.859
[indistinct shouting]

15:22.046 --> 15:23.297
Get off my block.

16:19.144 --> 16:19.979
[beeps]

16:22.982 --> 16:25.526
-Hey, I appreciate you.
-Always.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.861
Could still use your help.
You wanna meet us at the Pit?

16:28.445 --> 16:29.989
Yeah. I got you.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.365

36:08.583 --> 36:11.586
[Gambi] Thanking you for bringing me
the last ASA personnel

36:11.669 --> 36:13.379
that know the Pierce family secrets.

36:14.338 --> 36:18.759
You're welcome.
They all know you very well.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.430
-You're not gonna get out of here.
-[Gambi] I've seen worse.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.182
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

36:27.768 --> 36:28.603
[gunfire]

36:30.897 --> 36:33.107
-[soldier 4] Visual! Visual!
-[soldier 5] Negative. He's on the move.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.568
We have visual.

36:39.655 --> 36:40.531
Flash out!

36:41.115 --> 36:42.158
[soldier 5] Flashing!

36:44.911 --> 36:45.953
Go, go!

36:51.626 --> 36:52.752
North side clear!

36:57.089 --> 36:58.132
[soldier 6] Nothing here, sir!

36:59.258 --> 37:00.301
[soldier 7] He's here somewhere.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.886
-[soldier 8] On me.
-[soldier 9] Okay.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.599
All clear.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.185
We're left.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.355
Pulling.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.566
[indistinct shouting]

37:15.650 --> 37:16.484
[gunfire continues]

37:28.788 --> 37:29.664
[Gambi] TC?

37:32.333 --> 37:33.459
You okay?

37:33.542 --> 37:34.543
[TC coughing]

37:34.627 --> 37:35.544
[Gambi] Come on.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.546
[grunts] I got you.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.259
Come on.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.679
-You're doing good. You're doing good.
-Okay.

37:49.558 --> 37:50.893
Look, so, what's your assessment?

37:53.813 --> 37:58.484
She's in a coma. I'm sorry, honey,
but you know how this goes.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.987
It could be ten minutes.
It could be ten years.

38:02.863 --> 38:06.492
And there's no data to determine
how the shapeshifting might affect it.

38:06.575 --> 38:10.079
No... Come on, there's gotta be
something that you can do.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.543
She needs to be someplace
where she can have constant care.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.256
And we can pray.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.974
[broadcaster 1] <i>The last of our</i>
<i>troops are returning from Freeland.</i>

38:30.057 --> 38:32.184
<i>The Americans have declined</i>
<i>to keep prisoners of war,</i>

38:32.268 --> 38:34.520
<i>but demanded reparations</i>
<i>for the damage to Freeland.</i>

38:34.603 --> 38:36.814
<i>The Prime Minister has flatly refused.</i>

38:36.897 --> 38:38.858
<i>Meanwhile, the Americans</i>
<i>are conducting hearings</i>

38:38.941 --> 38:42.028
<i>to investigate the provocation</i>
<i>that made our aid necessary.</i>

38:42.820 --> 38:43.946
Thanks, Ma.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.198
[broadcaster 2] <i>The commission</i>
<i>has been convened by Congress</i>

38:46.282 --> 38:48.367
<i>to look into the Freeland conflict.</i>

38:48.451 --> 38:51.287
<i>A heinous and brutal attack</i>
<i>on American soil.</i>

38:51.370 --> 38:55.791
<i>Among others, the vigilante known</i>
<i>as Black Lightning is expected to testify.</i>

38:55.875 --> 38:56.751
[Tobias] Hmm.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.962
The neon Negro's about to get
his 15 minutes of fame.

39:01.881 --> 39:05.384
He ain't nothing but a snitch,
just like you.

39:07.678 --> 39:12.099
Well, my brother, looks like
it's time for me to pack my bags.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.727
Things seem copacetic back home.

39:15.269 --> 39:18.189
Plus, I got a date
with a beautiful divorcée doctor.

39:18.939 --> 39:23.152
She's gonna help me get the crown
of Freeland that I am destined to wear.

39:24.862 --> 39:28.616
[Lynn] <i>I'm pleased to report that every</i>
<i>metahuman in Freeland has been stabilized.</i>

39:30.409 --> 39:34.580
<i>And though I was able to fix their bodies,</i>
<i>their lives remain shattered.</i>

39:34.663 --> 39:38.209
<i>They are outsiders in need</i>
<i>of reassimilation into society,</i>

39:38.292 --> 39:40.336
<i>an education, a place to live.</i>

39:40.836 --> 39:44.048
[congressional leader] <i>I have your</i>
<i>recommendations here for a boarding school</i>

39:44.131 --> 39:46.509
<i>keyed to the needs</i>
<i>of Freeland's metahumans.</i>

39:46.592 --> 39:49.136
This congressional commission
hereby ratifies your plan.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.640
-Thank you.
-The commission calls Black Lightning.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.770
So, what happened in Freeland
was not random.

39:58.604 --> 40:03.567
It was the latest in a long, reprehensible
history of experimenting on black people.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.654
From trial-and-error surgeries
on women in bondage

40:06.737 --> 40:09.615
to giving men syphilis at Tuskegee,

40:10.116 --> 40:16.288
and now two decades of illegal human
experimentation to create metahumans.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.546
All the evidence is in this briefcase.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.966
The chair recognizes Judge Isabella.

40:27.049 --> 40:30.636
Black Lightning, where did you
get that briefcase?

40:31.137 --> 40:32.430
[Black Lightning] From the ASA.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.349
Now, what you're looking at
is the master control

40:35.433 --> 40:38.436
for the ASA's operation on metahumans.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.772
The chair recognizes Judge Von Eeden.

40:41.856 --> 40:46.026
Black Lightning, I assume the information
in there is encrypted, is it not?

40:46.110 --> 40:48.904
It was, but it's been cracked.

40:48.988 --> 40:54.452
And it will reveal a crime
against humanity orchestrated by the ASA.

40:54.535 --> 40:58.247
And brought to its height
with Agent Odell in Freeland.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.916
[congressional leader] As chair of the
commission on the Freeland conflict,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.084
I promise you this.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.420
Agent Odell is being detained,

41:04.503 --> 41:06.589
and he will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

41:07.381 --> 41:10.342
Furthermore, the ASA will be disbanded,
effective tomorrow.

41:10.926 --> 41:11.760
[gavel bangs]

41:13.053 --> 41:15.347
For security reasons,
everyone will remain where they are

41:15.431 --> 41:18.309
until Black Lightning, Thunder
and Lightning have left the building.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.520
The lobby has been cleared for your exit.
