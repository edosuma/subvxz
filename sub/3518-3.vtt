00:14.500 --> 00:16.489
This is what the freedom
to assemble looks like!

00:16.578 --> 00:18.330
Stop silencing the press!

00:18.414 --> 00:20.832
Stop persecuting the opposition!

00:20.916 --> 00:24.295
Stop imprisoning people
simply because they're gay!

00:24.378 --> 00:26.213
You're destroying Russia's future!

00:26.297 --> 00:28.132
When Petrov's motorcade arrives,

00:28.215 --> 00:30.342
have the band already playing
as loud as they can.

00:30.426 --> 00:31.510
I'll speak to the colonel.

00:31.593 --> 00:33.678
- What about the Pussy Riot girls?
- I briefed them myself.

00:33.762 --> 00:36.056
Here's a list of the issues
they want you to discuss with Petrov.

00:36.140 --> 00:37.391
- We're good to go.
- Tell them I did.

00:37.475 --> 00:39.310
Sure it's a good idea
to have them at the dinner?

00:39.393 --> 00:40.873
It's a smart idea.
They're dissidents.

00:40.936 --> 00:42.687
They've been nothing but a pain
in Petrov's ass.

00:42.771 --> 00:44.564
He wants to co-opt them
with a photo? Fine.

00:44.648 --> 00:46.488
If it's important to him,
it's important to me.

00:46.566 --> 00:48.235
- Bob.
- Mr. President.

00:48.319 --> 00:50.404
We have to get these amendments
out of committee.

00:50.488 --> 00:52.072
Get AmWorks on the floor.

00:52.156 --> 00:54.533
We might be able to squeeze
a couple through, but not all seven.

00:54.616 --> 00:55.909
Then restructure the funding.

00:55.993 --> 00:57.744
Shoot for one amendment
in one committee.

00:57.828 --> 00:58.996
Try Ways and Means.

00:59.079 --> 01:00.998
The Republicans
will never go for a lump sum.

01:01.081 --> 01:03.208
We have to split it up
into jurisdictional parts.

01:03.292 --> 01:06.504
When I announced America Works,
I promised ten million jobs.

01:06.586 --> 01:08.839
- Maybe it's time to lower expectations.
- No, look...

01:08.922 --> 01:11.967
Pardon me, sir.
President Petrov's motorcade is 15 out.

01:12.050 --> 01:13.511
- Thank you.
- I'll let you go.

01:13.593 --> 01:15.595
Bob, we have a few more minutes.
Please sit down.

01:15.679 --> 01:17.079
You have a lot on your plate today.

01:17.139 --> 01:19.224
Why don't we pick it up tonight
at the state dinner?

01:19.308 --> 01:21.268
Looking forward to it, Mr. President.

01:25.356 --> 01:26.940
What is the face of a coward?

01:27.024 --> 01:29.193
The back of his head
as he runs from the battle.

01:51.923 --> 01:55.219
- Welcome, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

01:55.302 --> 01:57.304
This is your first visit
to the White House?

01:57.388 --> 02:00.765
Yes, yes.
But my third president.

02:08.607 --> 02:11.651
I have reviewed your proposal
for the Jordan Valley.

02:13.362 --> 02:14.946
Impressive.

02:16.615 --> 02:19.577
So you liked the proposal?

02:19.659 --> 02:22.413
The answer is no.

02:22.496 --> 02:24.373
It's not a joke, Mr. President.

02:25.374 --> 02:29.044
I have no interest whatsoever
in pursuing your plan.

02:32.788 --> 04:07.563
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

04:12.606 --> 04:16.067
The Jordan Valley
is the trees instead of the forest.

04:16.151 --> 04:19.654
And this bilateral approach,
it's... alienating.

04:19.738 --> 04:22.700
I don't often see eye to eye
with Ms. Caspi,

04:22.782 --> 04:26.495
but it does feel like
you're asking the state of Palestine

04:26.578 --> 04:29.956
to support a plan without
having a seat at the table.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.834
Well, our goal is to soften Russia,

04:32.917 --> 04:35.045
to bring them in as a partner first...

04:35.128 --> 04:38.549
If we can get the Russians
to agree to a joint force,

04:38.632 --> 04:41.843
monitor the valley together,
then they're invested.

04:41.926 --> 04:44.127
They won't be a thorn in our side
when we move forward...

04:44.137 --> 04:46.390
How can we count on the Russians?

04:46.473 --> 04:49.643
Does your husband truly
believe he can trust Petrov?

04:51.228 --> 04:52.688
The president is optimistic.

04:52.771 --> 04:55.065
All we ask is that you
remain open-minded.

04:55.148 --> 04:59.611
I hope you'll convey our dissatisfaction
directly to your husband.

04:59.695 --> 05:01.613
I'll be sure to share your concerns.

05:01.697 --> 05:05.367
Ambassador Underwood
will remain in contact with both of you.

05:15.586 --> 05:18.505
I shouldn't have
interrupted you earlier.

05:18.589 --> 05:20.632
In the meeting.
It was out of place,

05:20.716 --> 05:22.926
and I should have let you
do all the talking.

05:23.009 --> 05:24.511
It's fine.

05:26.263 --> 05:28.807
I know you have doubts about me.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.351
The recess appointment.
We haven't discussed it.

05:31.435 --> 05:34.438
- And we should.
- It really isn't necessary.

05:34.521 --> 05:38.400
It is an unorthodox dynamic, yes.
You will always be the First Lady.

05:38.483 --> 05:41.403
This is your plane, after all.
But we can work around that.

05:41.486 --> 05:42.487
Yes, I know,

05:42.571 --> 05:44.281
but I want you to know that...

05:44.364 --> 05:46.283
Mrs. Underwood,
the president is on the line.

05:56.794 --> 05:58.336
- Hi.
- Hey. How'd it go?

05:58.420 --> 06:00.589
- Should we conference Cathy in?
- No, just tell me.

06:00.672 --> 06:02.340
A lot of pushback. They aren't happy.

06:02.424 --> 06:04.551
Well, they'll get on board
when the time comes.

06:04.635 --> 06:06.845
- What about you?
- He said no.

06:06.928 --> 06:09.556
- First word out of his mouth.
- No to everything?

06:09.640 --> 06:12.481
Oh, he might just be playing mind
games, trying to throw me off balance,

06:12.559 --> 06:15.079
but this is a guy who was brought up
through the KGB, after all.

06:15.103 --> 06:17.481
We're gonna have to have you
and Cathy use the light touch.

06:17.564 --> 06:20.066
- We need to massage this.
- Let's include her in this phone call.

06:20.150 --> 06:21.710
No, just tell her.
I have to go in soon.

06:21.777 --> 06:24.237
It's important we don't bypass her.

06:24.321 --> 06:26.761
If it looks like we're
leaving her out of the loop, Francis...

06:26.824 --> 06:28.074
All right, put her on.

06:28.158 --> 06:30.285
I can't tell you how much
it would mean to the team.

06:30.368 --> 06:33.037
To have your qualifications,
your expertise on board.

06:33.121 --> 06:35.081
Even just having your name
on the website.

06:35.165 --> 06:37.208
I appreciate your saying that,
Congressman.

06:37.292 --> 06:39.961
Brad. Please.
Congressman's what the interns call me.

06:40.044 --> 06:41.713
All right. Brad it is.

06:41.797 --> 06:44.842
Now as for your title,
I was thinking Special Advisor?

06:44.924 --> 06:47.469
- Title doesn't matter to me.
- You pick what you want.

06:47.552 --> 06:49.929
And you make your own hours.
Come and go as you like.

06:50.013 --> 06:53.308
Uh, compensation,
would 220 a year work for you?

06:54.225 --> 06:56.353
The cap is 173.

06:56.436 --> 06:59.063
Well, the extra 50K
would come out of my re-election fund.

06:59.147 --> 07:01.191
I mean, you deserve more than the cap.

07:02.192 --> 07:04.444
- That's a very generous offer.
- Well, I expect you to earn it.

07:04.528 --> 07:07.447
I really want
to make my mark this session.

07:07.531 --> 07:10.492
- That's more than Underwood paid me.
- I'm sorry?

07:10.575 --> 07:13.286
When I was his chief of staff,
I made the cap.

07:13.370 --> 07:14.830
He never came anywhere near 220.

07:14.913 --> 07:16.554
Well, like I said, I think you deserve...

07:16.581 --> 07:18.709
It's too much money, Congressman.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.168
Well, I disagree, but,

07:20.251 --> 07:22.371
hey, I'm not gonna argue
if you want to get paid less.

07:23.588 --> 07:25.131
As I was saying, this transpo bill,

07:25.215 --> 07:27.425
we really have an opportunity
to make a difference.

07:35.934 --> 07:38.186
Ladies and gentlemen,
the session is over.

07:38.269 --> 07:41.022
Please, right this way.
Thank you for coming.

07:47.738 --> 07:49.907
I hear you've recently taken up surfing.

07:51.324 --> 07:53.618
We have a few spots on the Black Sea.

07:53.702 --> 07:55.787
It's mostly so I can pose
for the photos.

07:55.871 --> 07:57.539
Yes, I've seen them.

07:59.290 --> 08:02.168
It plays well with the young people.

08:02.252 --> 08:04.379
It's important they see
their president has some fun,

08:04.462 --> 08:06.089
doesn't take himself too seriously.

08:09.092 --> 08:10.260
I have a gift for you.

08:14.765 --> 08:17.183
I'm sorry for the delay.

08:17.267 --> 08:19.436
I hope we didn't keep you
waiting too long.

08:22.439 --> 08:23.815
Shall we?

08:23.899 --> 08:28.528
This was handmade by Tomas Vu,
a very talented American artist.

08:28.612 --> 08:33.157
He laser-etches images on one side,
and on the other side...

08:33.241 --> 08:36.787
- he puts Beatles lyrics.
- Uh-huh.

08:36.870 --> 08:38.621
Hm. Back in the USSR.

08:38.705 --> 08:41.082
It's a museum piece,
but you can still ride it.

08:41.164 --> 08:43.961
You should come out
to my dacha in Sochi sometime.

08:44.043 --> 08:45.503
We'll surf together.

08:45.587 --> 08:49.633
The water is cold as hell, but...
the women are very warm.

08:49.716 --> 08:52.051
Oh, I'm not sure what Claire
would think about that.

08:52.135 --> 08:55.013
Well, bring her along.

08:55.096 --> 08:56.890
It's crawling with artists out there.

08:56.974 --> 08:58.516
She might find something she likes.

09:01.895 --> 09:03.563
Mr. President, I'm intrigued.

09:03.647 --> 09:06.566
The first thing you say to me
is "no" the second you arrive,

09:06.650 --> 09:09.319
and the next moment
you're inviting me to your dacha.

09:09.402 --> 09:10.946
Who am I dealing with?

09:11.029 --> 09:14.157
I believe I was clear when we first met.
What confuses you?

09:14.240 --> 09:16.534
Our delegations have been discussing
these issues for months.

09:16.618 --> 09:19.871
Yes, but discussions
are not the same as commitment.

09:19.955 --> 09:22.499
And, uh, I'm telling you now.

09:22.582 --> 09:24.709
There will be no commitment.

09:24.793 --> 09:26.878
You could've told me that on the phone.

09:29.297 --> 09:32.676
I assumed you were undoing
an insult by having me here.

09:32.759 --> 09:34.177
What insult is that?

09:34.260 --> 09:37.305
Two of your predecessors
never invited me to Washington.

09:37.388 --> 09:39.516
This summit is not just for show.

09:39.599 --> 09:42.185
I want to make meaningful strides
toward peace.

09:42.268 --> 09:45.022
The Middle East is hopeless.
History tells us that.

09:45.104 --> 09:47.774
I'm offering you
the chance to make history.

09:47.858 --> 09:48.900
I'll be honest with you,

09:48.984 --> 09:51.611
because you've been kind enough
to invite me to your country.

09:52.988 --> 09:56.240
Russia has nothing to gain
from peace in the Middle East.

09:56.324 --> 10:00.745
And more importantly, nothing
to gain from working with America.

10:02.747 --> 10:04.708
Israel has always distrusted us.

10:04.791 --> 10:08.127
- You expect that to change?
- We expect to build trust over time.

10:10.588 --> 10:14.425
How was your meeting
with the ambassadors this morning?

10:14.509 --> 10:17.261
Ambassador Aruri called me.

10:17.345 --> 10:20.682
They have their doubts, but we
encouraged them to keep an open mind.

10:20.765 --> 10:22.350
He described it as grave concerns.

10:22.433 --> 10:24.234
They will acclimate
as soon as we establish...

10:24.268 --> 10:27.355
Has your husband made direct overtures
to Israel and Palestine?

10:27.438 --> 10:31.735
All formal communication has been
handled through the State Department.

10:31.818 --> 10:34.029
But your husband can't possibly
believe they'll comply.

10:34.112 --> 10:35.793
Gentlemen,
for the purposes of these talks,

10:35.822 --> 10:39.200
I'd appreciate it if you refer to him
as the president, not as my husband.

10:39.283 --> 10:40.952
Of course, Madam Ambassador.

10:41.036 --> 10:43.162
And you really should be addressing
Secretary Durant.

10:43.246 --> 10:45.832
She speaks on his behalf more than I do.

10:46.917 --> 10:50.503
Our apologies, Madam Secretary.
Please, continue.

10:50.587 --> 10:55.842
We'd like to finish reviewing
the specifics, so page 12, please.

10:55.926 --> 10:59.096
Mr. President, we're already
working together on several fronts:

10:59.178 --> 11:02.390
nonproliferation,
the War on Terror, North Korea.

11:02.473 --> 11:05.153
I don't see any reason that
the Middle East should be any different.

11:05.226 --> 11:07.478
- Because it's an American plan.
- It's not an American plan.

11:07.562 --> 11:09.731
- I'm promising equal terms.
- Oh, promises.

11:09.814 --> 11:12.567
Carter promised equal involvement,
then shut us out of Camp David.

11:12.650 --> 11:15.236
- Clinton did the same with Bosnia.
- I'm the president now.

11:15.319 --> 11:16.529
That won't happen this time.

11:16.613 --> 11:19.741
Until 18 months from now,
when you are replaced.

11:22.869 --> 11:24.662
I'm jealous, Viktor.

11:26.123 --> 11:29.333
You don't answer to anyone.
You have no real opposition.

11:29.417 --> 11:32.336
You know exactly how
every election is gonna turn out.

11:32.420 --> 11:35.673
Well, it's not like that
in the United States.

11:35.757 --> 11:41.638
I'm not running because I can do things
a candidate can't do, like this proposal.

11:41.721 --> 11:45.224
Please, Mr. President,
we both know you'll run.

11:45.308 --> 11:48.895
Now, whether you win...
Who knows?

11:48.979 --> 11:52.565
Brass tacks. If you could have anything,
what would it be?

11:54.818 --> 11:56.861
I came with nothing to ask.

11:57.988 --> 12:01.449
Men like you don't show up for dinner
without an appetite.

12:06.037 --> 12:08.873
It was a long flight, Mr. President.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.751
How about we stop here for now.

12:11.835 --> 12:15.588
I rest my eyes a bit and put some
thought into this with a fresh mind.

12:15.672 --> 12:19.300
Maybe I'll...
think of something I want.

12:20.343 --> 12:24.597
- We'll talk more later, at dinner.
- Of course, if that's what you prefer.

12:26.975 --> 12:29.727
He knows exactly what he wants,
but he needs to be wooed.

12:29.811 --> 12:31.062
Progress, nonetheless.

12:31.146 --> 12:34.607
You can't turn a "no" to a "yes"
without a "maybe" in between.

12:44.201 --> 12:46.077
Gentlemen...

12:46.161 --> 12:48.454
Deputy Director coming through.

13:24.824 --> 13:27.535
Orsay? Come with me, please.

13:28.494 --> 13:30.205
We got Asher.

13:30.288 --> 13:32.957
Two-thirty this morning.
He was scared to death.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.919
By 2:45, he gave us six terabytes
of compressed files.

13:36.002 --> 13:38.213
All 25 million AT&T users.

13:38.296 --> 13:39.977
You hid your goodies
with the wrong person.

13:40.006 --> 13:43.134
- He wasn't the only one.
- I think he was.

13:43.218 --> 13:46.012
You can't arrest me for charges
that have already been dropped.

13:46.096 --> 13:47.847
Relax. No one's arresting you.

13:49.057 --> 13:53.144
From the reports I've been getting,
you've been doing an excellent job for us.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.355
If you stay straight, sky's the limit.

13:56.439 --> 13:58.066
Bigger assignments.
Manage your own team.

13:58.149 --> 13:59.776
You know I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

13:59.859 --> 14:02.028
But you do have a choice.

14:02.112 --> 14:05.156
You can make the most
of this second chance if you want to,

14:05.240 --> 14:09.160
but... you have to prove you want it.

14:10.661 --> 14:12.872
- Names.
- That's all I've ever wanted.

14:14.457 --> 14:15.875
No.

14:19.503 --> 14:21.214
Asher's going to give up names.

14:22.757 --> 14:25.302
- He wouldn't do that.
- He might.

14:25.384 --> 14:29.055
Let's hope none of them tell us about
anything we didn't charge you for.

14:30.932 --> 14:34.852
You have a future here, Gavin.

14:37.272 --> 14:39.607
All right. Back to it.

14:42.735 --> 14:44.570
Keep up the good work.

14:45.488 --> 14:47.657
We have to wine and dine.

14:47.740 --> 14:50.451
- Charm them senseless.
- Them? Who's the other?

14:50.534 --> 14:53.788
Birch. He's sitting on AmWorks
like his ass is afraid of the sun.

14:53.871 --> 14:55.957
Please don't make me talk to Bob.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.751
You just focus on Petrov.
I'll deal with Bob.

14:58.835 --> 15:00.920
Excuse me, sir. We're all set.

15:01.004 --> 15:02.839
President Petrov is in the Yellow Oval.

15:02.922 --> 15:04.465
Thank you, Calista.

15:07.844 --> 15:10.180
I think I may need to do
some damage control with Cathy.

15:10.263 --> 15:12.807
- Why?
- I've been trying to be deferential,

15:12.890 --> 15:15.393
but I think it's coming off
as patronizing.

15:15.476 --> 15:18.521
- Well, that was the risk.
- I know.

15:18.604 --> 15:20.564
Is she feeling threatened?

15:20.648 --> 15:23.693
Threatened, no.
Possibly overshadowed.

15:23.776 --> 15:27.197
I think I'm getting too much attention
and it's tough to be effective

15:27.280 --> 15:30.367
when I don't have Cathy on my team,
so I may need to win her over.

15:30.449 --> 15:33.203
Well, let's not forget
where the focus is tonight.

15:33.286 --> 15:36.331
Since when can't I do
two things at once?

15:36.414 --> 15:38.541
- You're crooked.
- What?

15:41.127 --> 15:44.339
- Ready for battle.
- Yes.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.087
The Vice President of the United States,
Donald Blythe.

16:24.170 --> 16:26.172
- Mr. President. Welcome.
- Mr. Vice President.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.716
Thank you.

16:28.799 --> 16:30.427
President Petrov, welcome.

16:30.509 --> 16:33.179
It's a pleasure.

16:33.263 --> 16:35.056
Hi. You look beautiful.

16:35.139 --> 16:36.891
Oh, it's serviceable.

16:36.974 --> 16:39.477
- You look fantastic, as always.
- Thank you.

16:39.560 --> 16:43.022
All eyes at the table
will be on you, not them.

16:44.815 --> 16:47.485
Senator Mendoza.
Soon to be candidate Mendoza.

16:47.568 --> 16:51.072
- The rumor mill begins.
- You started with Reagan, no?

16:51.155 --> 16:52.865
Staffed on his '84 campaign.

16:52.949 --> 16:55.952
He has a portrait of the Gipper
in his office wearing a cowboy hat.

16:56.035 --> 16:59.538
Hm. When men were men. Hm?

17:03.960 --> 17:06.796
Bob, I had a thought. Dave Blanchek
is on Armed Services and...

17:06.878 --> 17:09.589
I don't want to hold up the line.

17:09.673 --> 17:12.135
- Mr. President, a pleasure.
- I want to move Birch.

17:12.218 --> 17:13.928
Put Mendoza next to me instead.

17:14.011 --> 17:16.973
Alan. You clean up well.

17:17.056 --> 17:18.641
Class by association.

17:18.723 --> 17:20.477
- Where's your date?
- I don't have one.

17:20.559 --> 17:24.188
- I can walk you in too, if you'd like.
- No. Wouldn't want to ruin the picture.

17:26.816 --> 17:27.942
Ah, our special guests.

17:28.025 --> 17:29.735
I'm so delighted
you could be with us.

17:29.819 --> 17:31.946
Thank you so much for coming.
Mr. President.

17:32.029 --> 17:34.907
It's taken us too long
to sit at the same table.

17:34.991 --> 17:39.246
Did you discuss
our issues in the closed talks?

17:39.329 --> 17:40.663
We discussed many things.

17:40.746 --> 17:43.791
But specifically our concerns?

17:43.874 --> 17:46.210
Was anything on our list discussed?

17:46.294 --> 17:48.963
- Why don't we take a photo first?
- Good idea. Hm?

18:08.732 --> 18:11.444
Viktor, tell me. Are you in love?

18:11.528 --> 18:15.365
I don't know about...
love, but...

18:17.241 --> 18:19.952
I'm learning to enjoy being divorced.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.212
Which translates into:

18:29.295 --> 18:31.839
"Howdy, and please
don't steal the silverware."

18:34.551 --> 18:37.554
Now that I have exhausted
all of the Russian I know,

18:37.636 --> 18:41.224
Claire and I would like to welcome
all of you to the White House,

18:41.307 --> 18:46.479
as we host President Petrov
in this historic state visit.

18:46.563 --> 18:49.899
A century ago, a century and a half ago,

18:49.982 --> 18:54.987
de Tocqueville wrote, in regards
to America and Russia, the following:

18:55.071 --> 18:58.866
"Their point of departure
and their paths diverse,

18:58.949 --> 19:01.952
nevertheless, each seems called

19:02.036 --> 19:05.873
by some secret desire of Providence,

19:05.956 --> 19:11.295
to one day hold in their hands
the destinies of half the world."

19:11.379 --> 19:15.049
Well, I'd like to amend that tonight
and say, not just half the world,

19:15.132 --> 19:19.554
the entire world looks to us
for leadership.

19:19.637 --> 19:24.225
So, to President Petrov,
and all of the great things

19:24.308 --> 19:26.685
that our great nations
will do together.

19:26.769 --> 19:29.439
- Mr. President.
- Hear, hear!

19:36.362 --> 19:39.365
Which is Russian for,
"Never trust the French."

19:41.784 --> 19:45.829
And thank you to the president and First
Lady for your grace and hospitality.

19:45.913 --> 19:48.625
Now, a little more recently
than de Tocqueville,

19:48.707 --> 19:51.419
about, uh, 30 years ago,

19:51.502 --> 19:54.046
Mikhail Gorbachev came
to this very house

19:54.130 --> 19:57.716
and talked of an end
to our "winter of discontent."

19:59.093 --> 20:04.098
I think it's safe to say that
that winter seems far gone now.

20:04.181 --> 20:09.353
And here, on this beautiful May evening,
I welcome a "spring of enchantment."

20:09.437 --> 20:14.024
Now we all know which of you
brings the enchantment to the table.

20:14.609 --> 20:16.402
To you, Mrs. Underwood.

20:19.947 --> 20:23.451
- And, of course, your lesser half.
- Ah, thank you.

20:26.912 --> 20:31.709
Now I'd like to toast three others
in this room tonight.

20:31.792 --> 20:35.672
Nadya Tolokonnikova,
Masha Alyokhina,

20:35.754 --> 20:37.632
and Pyotr Verzilov.

20:37.715 --> 20:40.342
Now, I know we had our differences.

20:40.426 --> 20:44.263
But I also know they come
from something we all share:

20:45.682 --> 20:48.434
a deep love of our country.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.189
To you. And to Russia.

20:54.398 --> 20:58.027
Mr. President, Nadya and Masha
would like to make a toast.

21:04.367 --> 21:07.495
To Viktor Petrov,
whose loyalty runs so deep

21:07.578 --> 21:09.372
he's given his friends
half of the country.

21:11.207 --> 21:14.502
Who's so open to criticism,
that most of his critics are in prison.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.762
You made your point.

21:25.722 --> 21:30.601
Now, please, sit and let us all

21:30.685 --> 21:34.313
drink and laugh,
like true Russians do. Hm?

21:46.992 --> 21:48.869
Well, Mr. President,

21:48.952 --> 21:53.082
this is proof why you made the
right decision never to have children.

22:01.090 --> 22:03.008
My staff prepped them.

22:03.092 --> 22:05.511
- They assured us.
- It's nothing.

22:05.595 --> 22:09.098
- I admire your grace.
- Please. Not another word.

22:10.767 --> 22:13.310
I knew Pussy Riot was a bad idea.

22:13.394 --> 22:16.313
- You should go.
- No. Best thing is not to comment.

22:16.397 --> 22:18.441
It lowers us to their level.

22:19.650 --> 22:21.193
Juice or soda?

22:21.277 --> 22:22.945
Diet something, if you got it.

22:24.321 --> 22:26.031
Who are they?

22:29.285 --> 22:30.953
My brother's kids.

22:32.246 --> 22:33.581
Adorable.

22:40.963 --> 22:44.091
- I got a job offer.
- Yeah? Where?

22:44.174 --> 22:47.094
Brad Petite. Special Advisor.

22:47.886 --> 22:49.806
From Hawaii.

22:49.888 --> 22:51.641
- Junior congressman?
- That's right.

22:51.724 --> 22:54.769
I like him. He's a good guy.
He's ambitious.

22:54.852 --> 22:56.979
He offered me a lot of money.

22:57.062 --> 22:59.565
- Yeah?
- Two-twenty.

22:59.649 --> 23:01.484
Jesus.

23:02.568 --> 23:05.237
That's more than I would ever make
at the White House.

23:08.198 --> 23:11.786
- You arrange the job?
- No.

23:11.869 --> 23:13.579
Did the president?

23:13.663 --> 23:16.165
- What are you talking about?
- Don't bullshit me, Seth.

23:16.248 --> 23:17.916
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

23:20.002 --> 23:22.129
Who's the senior congressman
from Hawaii?

23:23.422 --> 23:26.091
Chair of Appropriations.

23:26.175 --> 23:28.302
I know him,
I'm just drawing a blank right now.

23:28.969 --> 23:31.764
It's not him, it's a her.

23:31.848 --> 23:34.851
Francine Tenaka.
And if you don't know who Tenaka is,

23:34.933 --> 23:37.186
there's no reason you should know
who Brad Petite is,

23:37.269 --> 23:39.897
or that he's ambitious or a good guy.

23:39.980 --> 23:43.400
This job offer came from you
or the president.

23:43.484 --> 23:45.695
And I'm telling you that it didn't.

23:48.030 --> 23:49.740
Well, I'm turning it down.

23:50.658 --> 23:54.161
You tell the president that I'm ready
to come back whenever he needs me.

23:54.244 --> 23:56.330
I don't need training wheels.

24:10.594 --> 24:12.763
I need you to work on Birch
while you're here.

24:12.847 --> 24:15.558
See if you can get that list
of possible candidates.

24:15.641 --> 24:17.882
I don't think putting him down
the far end of the table's

24:17.935 --> 24:19.136
put him in a very chatty mood.

24:22.523 --> 24:25.735
Refrigeration.
Are you talking about refrigeration?

24:25.818 --> 24:28.153
- No.
- Re-bridge nations.

24:28.237 --> 24:31.365
We need to re-bridgenate ourselves
so we'll more trust each other.

24:31.448 --> 24:33.075
Da? Yes.

24:33.158 --> 24:35.452
Let's get these amendments
out of committee.

24:35.536 --> 24:36.937
Not all of them, just some of them.

24:36.995 --> 24:39.415
The Speaker would go ballistic
if I started meddling in the House.

24:39.498 --> 24:41.959
Not if it means he's going to battle
with the presumptive nominee.

24:42.084 --> 24:43.627
He knows where his bread is buttered.

24:43.711 --> 24:46.792
You shove your wife's recess appointment
down my throat, now you want my help?

24:46.839 --> 24:48.131
I had to fill the post.

24:48.215 --> 24:50.760
And you have a city
full of career diplomats.

24:50.843 --> 24:52.724
Her appointment was
a slap in the Senate's face.

24:52.803 --> 24:54.972
Let's not get hung up
on appointments, all right?

24:55.055 --> 24:57.224
Hector, whatever
you want me to sign, I'll sign.

24:57.307 --> 24:59.351
I will not hold a veto over your head.

24:59.435 --> 25:03.439
You can veto whatever you want.
Just helps our case in 2016.

25:03.522 --> 25:05.315
Excuse me.

25:10.988 --> 25:14.324
Which is more intoxicating,
this wine or Claire Underwood?

25:16.619 --> 25:17.995
How often do you use that line?

25:18.078 --> 25:21.206
- Not as often as you use yours.
- Which line is that?

25:22.207 --> 25:24.334
"Viktor, are you in love?"

25:27.129 --> 25:30.758
President Descoteaux told me you asked
him the same thing when he was here.

25:33.010 --> 25:36.388
I believe my husband quoted a Russian
author the night he gave that toast.

25:36.472 --> 25:39.391
- Don't say, uh... Tolstoy?
- Pushkin.

25:39.475 --> 25:44.271
"A deception that elevates us
is dearer than a host of low truths."

25:44.354 --> 25:47.650
Ah... He didn't make that toast.

25:48.692 --> 25:52.029
- No, he didn't.
- No, no.

25:52.112 --> 25:54.197
Tell me, do you
actually know your Pushkin,

25:54.281 --> 25:56.951
or did you just study up
before I arrived?

25:57.034 --> 25:59.161
Does it really matter?

26:01.956 --> 26:05.001
So, this is what he does?

26:05.083 --> 26:07.085
He leaves the seduction to you.

26:07.169 --> 26:10.756
Isn't there a...
a word for that in English? Um...

26:10.840 --> 26:14.217
- For what?
- "Pimping," yes?

26:14.301 --> 26:16.178
He's pimping you out.

26:18.221 --> 26:19.807
How charming you are.

26:19.890 --> 26:21.642
Thank you.

26:21.725 --> 26:24.770
And you make a much better First Lady
than ambassador,

26:24.854 --> 26:26.897
from what my people tell me.

26:29.692 --> 26:31.027
Only teasing.

26:31.944 --> 26:35.698
More wine... for the ambassador.

26:35.781 --> 26:37.240
Please.

26:49.003 --> 26:51.588
I'm gonna have to go
in a couple minutes.

26:51.672 --> 26:53.841
Ah!

26:53.924 --> 26:57.302
Mr. President, my gift for you.

26:58.178 --> 27:00.305
Best vodka in the world.

27:00.389 --> 27:02.808
Osobaya Sayanskaya.

27:04.309 --> 27:05.769
Solid gold.

27:05.853 --> 27:08.731
Each one of these bottles is 750,000.

27:10.399 --> 27:12.609
Now, a toast.

27:16.446 --> 27:19.616
To friendship, to good food,

27:19.700 --> 27:24.621
and to Leo Tolstoy, who said,

27:24.705 --> 27:27.833
"If you want to be happy, be."

27:27.917 --> 27:30.377
Drink!

27:35.507 --> 27:36.508
Ah!

27:36.592 --> 27:39.636
Now... you sniff your bread.

27:43.223 --> 27:45.434
Say "Nu."

27:45.517 --> 27:46.936
Nu!

27:47.019 --> 27:48.979
Then whistle.

27:49.063 --> 27:50.564
Sniff your sleeve.

27:52.357 --> 27:54.944
And... eat your pickle.

27:55.611 --> 27:58.280
Now, why we do all this?

27:59.448 --> 28:02.701
No one knows.

28:02.785 --> 28:04.036
Again!

28:04.120 --> 28:06.455
- Oh, no. Now, Mr. President.
- Mm, mm!

28:07.330 --> 28:10.167
Now, you, Mr. Vice President.

28:10.250 --> 28:13.378
- A toast!
- Oh! Uh... Um...

28:13.462 --> 28:16.132
Uh, to, uh... further cooperation

28:16.214 --> 28:20.343
between our two countries
and, uh... continued... uh...

28:20.427 --> 28:24.056
Oh, hell. Here's how!

28:27.184 --> 28:30.104
Again!

28:32.314 --> 28:35.818
Now, you... Mrs. Underwood.

28:38.361 --> 28:41.740
To President Petrov and his...

28:41.824 --> 28:44.910
little pickle.

28:44.994 --> 28:45.994
Drink!

28:51.000 --> 28:52.292
Again!

why don't you come up and join me?

29:54.604 --> 29:55.898
Oh, no, no, no.

29:55.981 --> 29:57.399
- Come on.
- It's your show.

29:57.482 --> 29:59.943
I know you can sing.
I know you can sing.

Come on.

30:02.279 --> 30:04.740
All right, well, I almost...
I almost know this song.

30:04.823 --> 30:07.284

30:55.332 --> 30:58.294
Beautiful.
Beautiful, Mr. President.

30:58.335 --> 31:00.420
Now... now, Mr. Cincotti,

31:00.503 --> 31:02.881
uh, you might not know this one.

31:02.965 --> 31:05.926
But, um... it's easy to follow. Hm?

31:06.009 --> 31:09.305
Um... You have a C for me?

31:33.370 --> 31:35.413
You offered vetoes for sale to Mendoza?

31:35.497 --> 31:37.374
Bob, shh... the president's singing.

31:37.457 --> 31:39.209
Is that why you sat him next to you?

31:39.293 --> 31:42.254
Bob, as you said,
the Republicans control Congress.

31:49.386 --> 31:50.846
Any luck with Birch?

31:51.888 --> 31:54.557
No list yet.
I'll keep working him.

31:54.641 --> 31:56.810
Where's Dr. Cooke?

31:56.893 --> 31:58.854
He got called away to surgery.

32:01.773 --> 32:04.484
Save it for Svetla.

32:04.567 --> 32:05.986
That's not her name.

32:06.069 --> 32:08.322
She looks like a Svetla.

32:42.064 --> 32:44.900
Hey!

32:44.983 --> 32:48.945
Well, I don't think we can end
the evening on a higher note,

32:49.029 --> 32:50.989
so I want to thank you all for coming,

32:51.073 --> 32:54.076
for the singing
and the dancing and the vodka.

32:54.159 --> 32:56.119
But most especially to my friend,
Peter Cincotti.

32:56.203 --> 32:57.204
Thank you.

32:57.287 --> 32:59.081
Coming all the way here
to the White House.

32:59.164 --> 33:02.167
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

33:02.251 --> 33:05.128
Wonderful.
And thank you to you, Mr. Cincotti.

33:05.212 --> 33:06.422
Thank you. Thank you.

33:08.382 --> 33:10.259
Your motorcade is ready, Mr. President.

33:10.342 --> 33:11.468
I'll walk you out.

33:11.551 --> 33:13.845
But first, I want to show you something.
Come with me.

33:13.929 --> 33:15.847
- We'll be right down, Calista.
- Yes, sir.

33:17.349 --> 33:20.685
What if I get you transferred?
To some other agency.

33:20.769 --> 33:22.938
It doesn't matter
who I work for. He'll find a way.

33:27.734 --> 33:29.736
How much do you care about staying here?

33:29.819 --> 33:31.613
- What, DC?
- In this country.

33:31.696 --> 33:35.825
I'd have been long gone if they didn't
put a travel lock on my passport.

33:35.909 --> 33:37.660
So let's unlock it.

33:39.455 --> 33:42.791
Is that something you can do?
If I get you what you want?

33:43.750 --> 33:46.420
I need to know exactly where she is.

33:46.503 --> 33:49.923
Not a state. Not a city.
An address.

33:50.006 --> 33:54.136
If I use the Bureau's software and
get caught, I'll give them your name.

33:54.219 --> 33:56.054
I understand.

34:02.811 --> 34:03.853
All right.

34:05.188 --> 34:06.940
Tell me everything you know about her.

34:08.065 --> 34:09.443
Good night.

34:12.821 --> 34:15.157
- How about a night cap?
- Oh, it's late.

34:15.239 --> 34:17.867
And I haven't had that much vodka
since college.

34:17.951 --> 34:19.328
Tulane, right?

34:19.411 --> 34:21.538
So they tell me.
It's all a bit of a blur.

34:21.621 --> 34:24.040
What did you drink in school?
Hurricanes?

34:24.123 --> 34:27.377
Oh, we weren't barbarians.
Scotch, no ice.

34:27.460 --> 34:30.505
Oh... Two Chivas, neat.

34:34.134 --> 34:36.052
Cubans. Smuggled in.

34:36.136 --> 34:38.221
I thought you might
appreciate the irony.

34:38.304 --> 34:40.139
Ah. I do.

34:44.811 --> 34:47.938
Ah. And where does this lead?

34:48.023 --> 34:49.525
Basement entrance.

34:49.607 --> 34:52.027
The Nixon kids would
bring their dates up this way.

34:52.110 --> 34:55.364
Kennedy probably used it
for similar reasons.

34:55.447 --> 34:57.449
Well, you know, now that I'm divorced,

34:57.533 --> 35:00.285
I don't have to sneak anyone
in and out of the palace.

35:00.369 --> 35:03.246
They can come through the front door.
With some dignity.

35:03.330 --> 35:06.542
Well, dignity's a bit overrated
for a mistress, don't you think?

35:09.836 --> 35:14.924
Ah... you know,
a woman like your wife, for example,

35:15.008 --> 35:18.303
would certainly make it worthwhile.

35:18.387 --> 35:21.056
Do you kiss the wife
of every president you meet?

35:21.139 --> 35:24.476
Oh. Not every president's wife
looks like yours.

35:25.727 --> 35:28.688
I'd push him down the stairs
and light his broken body on fire

35:28.771 --> 35:32.650
just to watch it burn,
if it wouldn't start a world war.

35:32.734 --> 35:34.819
- May I?
- Of course.

35:39.616 --> 35:41.659
Well, do you think
they'll ever come around?

35:41.743 --> 35:43.537
Oh, I don't know.

35:43.620 --> 35:46.122
There'll be more summits,
a hundred CoDels.

35:46.206 --> 35:50.419
They'll ping-pong back and forth
for months before Petrov shows his hand.

35:54.256 --> 35:56.674
- What?
- Nothing.

35:56.758 --> 35:58.093
Tell me.

35:58.176 --> 36:01.430
I was just picturing Bugakov
playing ping-pong.

36:01.513 --> 36:05.350
Bugayev?

36:05.434 --> 36:07.727
Imagine him playing beer pong.

36:07.810 --> 36:10.355
Then these negotiations would be over.

36:10.439 --> 36:14.234
You are looking at the Delta Phi
beer pong champion.

36:14.317 --> 36:15.777
- No.
- Yes.

36:15.860 --> 36:17.862
Both sophomore and junior years.

36:17.946 --> 36:19.489
And what happened senior year?

36:19.573 --> 36:21.783
Well, I had to start studying
for law school.

36:23.826 --> 36:27.414
Well, I wasn't... a champion.

36:27.497 --> 36:29.749
- I wasn't too bad, though.
- You?

36:29.832 --> 36:32.461
Mm-hm.

36:32.544 --> 36:34.588
- I think we should play.
- What?

36:34.671 --> 36:35.797
Oh, you can't be serious.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.920
Excuse me? Can you ask housekeeping
to bring us some ping-pong balls, please?

36:38.925 --> 36:41.261
I have got to go home.

36:41.344 --> 36:43.472
We'll be playing by Harvard rules.

36:47.142 --> 36:51.062
You have to admire their fearlessness.

36:53.064 --> 36:55.400
None of them understand, do they?

36:56.067 --> 36:58.111
What it takes to govern.

36:58.194 --> 37:00.656
They scream and yell
and stomp their feet,

37:00.738 --> 37:03.366
but if they had to spend
just one day in our shoes,

37:03.450 --> 37:06.244
the weight we carry on our shoulders...

37:06.328 --> 37:09.914
Like, um... the Middle East?

37:11.291 --> 37:14.836
Oh, I know why we're here,
smoking our cigars.

37:17.380 --> 37:21.259
- And?
- You're not going to like it.

37:24.680 --> 37:27.015
Yes! Ha-ha!

37:27.098 --> 37:28.891
Drink up.

37:33.605 --> 37:35.231
Okay. For the Crimson.

37:40.153 --> 37:42.698
Damn!

37:50.205 --> 37:53.124
Yes! I still got it.

37:56.753 --> 37:58.714
You don't have to drink that.

37:58.796 --> 38:00.173
I accept your mercy.

38:01.341 --> 38:05.762
And I am going to leave
before you challenge me to a rematch.

38:05.845 --> 38:08.806
You're not even gonna give me a shot
at winning in my own house?

38:08.890 --> 38:11.685
First rule of diplomacy:
stop while you're ahead,

38:11.768 --> 38:15.772
which is what I should've done,
after that third vodka of Petrov's.

38:17.482 --> 38:19.526
What do you think of him?

38:20.235 --> 38:23.488
Petrov? I don't know.

38:24.698 --> 38:26.824
You were the one
who talked to him all night.

38:26.908 --> 38:28.660
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.

38:28.744 --> 38:31.246
So, not a fan?

38:31.329 --> 38:34.541
I think he's very intelligent.
And he has a charm.

38:34.624 --> 38:37.126
That kiss was... too much.

38:37.210 --> 38:39.546
No, that's just pushing buttons.

38:39.629 --> 38:42.716
The Russians love to do that.

38:42.799 --> 38:44.426
Good night.

38:45.594 --> 38:48.471
I don't think he's to be trusted, Cathy.

38:48.555 --> 38:51.725
Especially after tonight.
And it made me think...

38:54.102 --> 38:55.562
Go on.

38:56.521 --> 38:59.315
It made me wonder about Francis' plan.

38:59.399 --> 39:03.861
I'm not sure that it's a good idea
to be partnered with Petrov.

39:03.945 --> 39:07.699
In the meantime,
we alienate Israel and Palestine.

39:10.368 --> 39:14.831
Well... between you and me, I agree.

39:16.999 --> 39:18.835
Sit with me.

39:19.919 --> 39:21.963
What would you do differently?

39:24.299 --> 39:25.925
Well...

39:27.302 --> 39:30.472
If the goal is to get troops
into the Jordan Valley,

39:30.555 --> 39:34.267
well, then there's more than one way
to skin that cat.

39:34.350 --> 39:36.352
A multinational force?

39:36.436 --> 39:39.188
I would go through the UN.

39:39.272 --> 39:41.274
Peacekeeping?

39:41.357 --> 39:43.318
You wouldn't get past Russia's veto.

39:43.401 --> 39:47.864
There might be a way, but...

39:47.947 --> 39:52.034
you'd have a lot of responsibility
on your shoulders.

39:52.118 --> 39:55.455
Well, if you can give me guidance,
I'm sure I can handle it.

39:57.123 --> 40:01.670
There is precedent
with the Uniting for Peace Resolution.

40:01.753 --> 40:04.881
We used it to get around
the Russians for the Korean War.

40:10.219 --> 40:13.181
- The whole thing?
- From Poland to the UK.

40:13.264 --> 40:15.558
I want the entire
missile defense system gone.

40:15.642 --> 40:18.561
You know that's there to defend
against North Korea, against Iran.

40:18.645 --> 40:20.438
And far closer
to my borders than theirs.

40:20.522 --> 40:23.232
I'm asking for a few thousand troops
in the Jordan Valley.

40:23.316 --> 40:25.437
You're asking me to dismantle
Europe's defense system.

40:25.443 --> 40:27.904
What you're really asking for
is American forces

40:27.987 --> 40:29.656
just south of the Caucasus.

40:29.739 --> 40:32.074
You must have a strategic play in mind.

40:32.158 --> 40:34.202
This is about stability in the region.

40:34.285 --> 40:37.580
You're trying to consolidate
your foothold in the region. Hm?

40:37.664 --> 40:41.334
The Black Sea, Kazakhstan,
Chechnya, Crimea.

40:41.417 --> 40:45.171
So, please...
don't insult me with peace.

40:47.590 --> 40:53.304
Whatever your strategic goals may be,
the missile defense system is mine.

40:54.848 --> 40:58.727
Viktor, I invited you to Washington
with pure intentions,

40:58.810 --> 41:01.938
so that we could break bread
and learn to trust one another.

41:02.021 --> 41:05.066
Francis, I don't get softened up

41:05.149 --> 41:08.110
by a nice dinner
and dancing with a beautiful woman.

41:09.612 --> 41:11.406
You asked me what I want.

41:11.489 --> 41:13.575
Well... I told you.

41:16.994 --> 41:18.454
I'll tell you what.

41:18.538 --> 41:20.164
It's my turn to get some sleep.

41:20.248 --> 41:21.848
Let's attack all this with a fresh mind.

41:21.875 --> 41:24.502
We've barely smoked our cigars.

41:25.670 --> 41:28.840
We're not men of excess, though, are we?

41:30.341 --> 41:31.927
Aren't we?

41:35.722 --> 41:37.473
No, no.

41:37.557 --> 41:39.225
No, you're right.

41:41.811 --> 41:44.230
Enough smoke for one evening.

41:58.787 --> 42:00.705
What are you going to do?

42:01.581 --> 42:03.959
I don't know.

42:04.041 --> 42:05.919
Try to meet him halfway.

42:08.421 --> 42:10.966
Cathy and I were talking.

42:11.048 --> 42:13.384
Maybe the Israelis
and the Palestinians are right.

42:13.468 --> 42:15.637
We should consider starting with them.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.222
Use the United Nations
to put pressure on Russia.

42:18.306 --> 42:21.726
- How?
- Uniting for Peace.

42:21.810 --> 42:25.480
General Assembly overrides
a Russian veto in the Security Council.

42:25.563 --> 42:29.692
Well, that'll just antagonize them
even if it works. And it won't.

42:29.776 --> 42:32.528
Well, it might work.
Cathy seems to think it could.

42:32.612 --> 42:35.364
I thought you believed in this plan.

42:35.448 --> 42:38.827
We were just...
brainstorming alternatives.

42:38.910 --> 42:41.788
Well, I've worked too hard on it
just to abandon it.

42:43.414 --> 42:45.458
Okay, you know best.

43:07.563 --> 43:09.190
Do you mind?

43:10.984 --> 43:12.401
What?

43:12.485 --> 43:13.736
The light.

43:26.290 --> 43:27.876
Francis.

43:29.585 --> 43:31.629
He's a thug.

43:31.713 --> 43:33.548
Smart, but he's still a thug.

43:33.631 --> 43:35.341
Don't cower to him.

43:44.392 --> 43:49.438
Where I come from, we drop a raw egg
into some tomato juice and drink that.

43:49.522 --> 43:51.399
Luckily, I don't come from there.

43:53.068 --> 43:56.404
That's a perfect job for Doug.
I can't imagine why he'd turn it down.

43:56.487 --> 43:58.280
He thinks we were behind it.

43:58.364 --> 44:00.825
I told him we weren't,
but I don't think he believes me.

44:00.909 --> 44:02.785
Said he doesn't need training wheels.

44:02.869 --> 44:05.747
Well, I want you to still stop in
from time to time and see him.

44:05.830 --> 44:06.873
Yes, sir.

44:08.041 --> 44:10.752
Is the Secretary of Defense here?
Send him in.

44:13.212 --> 44:15.214
- Mr. President.
- We don't have much time.

44:15.297 --> 44:17.884
Petrov gets here in 90 minutes.
We need to talk Europe.

45:00.301 --> 45:02.762
The answer is yes.

45:03.638 --> 45:08.225
- To some, not all, of what you asked.
- I see.

45:08.309 --> 45:10.728
I'm prepared
to scale back significantly.

45:10.812 --> 45:15.357
Now, I have to speak to my team first
and my allies in NATO,

45:15.441 --> 45:17.777
but I'm confident that we can
do something meaningful

45:17.860 --> 45:20.029
in Poland and the Czech Republic.

45:20.113 --> 45:22.490
Now, our people
can work out the specifics.

45:22.573 --> 45:27.495
And whatever it is we decide
and agree on, the public cannot know.

45:32.083 --> 45:35.461
I woke up with the taste
of those cigars in my mouth.

45:36.420 --> 45:39.256
Thinking of Cuba and Kennedy.

45:39.340 --> 45:42.885
I won't be humiliated
the way Khrushchev was with Turkey.

45:42.969 --> 45:47.015
Well, you can't possibly compare what
I'm proposing to what happened then.

45:47.098 --> 45:50.101
I can only consider a partial
scale-back if you announce it.

45:53.104 --> 45:55.148
This press conference
is about the Jordan Valley.

45:55.231 --> 45:58.193
The most important thing about the
missiles is the scale-back, not the PR.

45:58.275 --> 46:00.611
My people would know
I walked away with something.

46:00.695 --> 46:05.200
And, by announcing it,
I can keep you to your word.

46:05.282 --> 46:07.994
I am more than
meeting you halfway, Viktor.

46:14.792 --> 46:18.379
You know what the best part
of the fall of the Soviet Union was?

46:19.338 --> 46:20.965
The cars.

46:22.008 --> 46:24.719
Have you ever been in, um... a Lada?

46:24.802 --> 46:26.303
Lada? No, I haven't.

46:26.387 --> 46:29.140
No? Oh. It's the worst car ever built.

46:29.224 --> 46:30.808
Tiny, little thing, you know.

46:30.892 --> 46:34.311
Your head would hit the ceiling
when you hit a pothole.

46:34.395 --> 46:37.523
And the heat never worked.

46:37.606 --> 46:39.108
And no air conditioning.

46:39.192 --> 46:42.195
You know, your skin would stick
to the seats in the summer.

46:42.278 --> 46:44.072
It was a coffin on wheels.

46:44.155 --> 46:48.659
But then, after the fall,
we got the Lexus.

46:50.036 --> 46:53.248
Temperature control.
Automatic windows.

46:53.330 --> 46:55.208
And so much room.

46:55.291 --> 46:58.294
First time I fucked my ex-wife,
in a Lexus.

46:58.419 --> 47:00.379
You could never do that in a Lada.

47:00.462 --> 47:02.924
No space. Huh?

47:03.007 --> 47:05.885
You see, Mr. President.

47:05.968 --> 47:07.720
I want the Lexus.

47:08.763 --> 47:11.182
And you're trying to sell me a Lada.

47:37.458 --> 47:39.877
I'll have them bring
your motorcade around.

47:43.089 --> 47:45.258
But the... press conference.

47:46.050 --> 47:49.804
Oh. Right!

47:49.887 --> 47:51.889
I'd completely forgotten.

47:52.974 --> 47:55.643
But I think we're gonna be okay
without one today.

47:57.686 --> 47:59.814
Have a safe journey home,
Mr. President.

48:09.198 --> 48:11.867
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. President.

48:22.295 --> 48:24.297
Give me the Secretary of State.

48:38.353 --> 48:41.438
The president will be speaking alone.
No joint conference.

48:43.816 --> 48:45.901
The president will be out shortly.

48:52.367 --> 48:54.952
Last night,
I had the pleasure of hosting

48:55.036 --> 48:57.955
some very special guests
here at the White House.

48:58.039 --> 49:00.958
True Russian patriots
who exhibit the very best

49:01.042 --> 49:03.336
that their country has to offer.

49:03.419 --> 49:06.297
Nadya Tolokonnikova,

49:06.381 --> 49:09.717
Masha Alyokhina and Pyotr Verzilov.

49:09.800 --> 49:13.304
As you're all aware,
they stood up to President Petrov,

49:13.388 --> 49:17.850
and forced him to listen to the truths
that he didn't want to hear.

49:19.310 --> 49:22.980
And, well, that had
a profound effect on me.

49:23.064 --> 49:26.150
Because it made me realize
that I need to stand up to him as well.

49:26.234 --> 49:28.403
As does our country.

49:28.485 --> 49:32.740
When I invited the president here,
I set out hoping to find a partner.

49:32.823 --> 49:35.284
But the demands
that President Petrov made

49:35.368 --> 49:40.248
proves to me that peace
is not a priority for him.

49:40.331 --> 49:43.834
Peace should not have to be bought.

49:43.918 --> 49:46.712
Peace should be its own reward,

49:46.795 --> 49:50.383
and we will achieve it,
with or without him.

49:50.466 --> 49:52.468
Thank you very much.

49:52.551 --> 49:54.762
You have thoughts
on how to bypass Russia.

49:54.845 --> 49:58.349
The idea is to negate Russia's
veto in the Security Council.

49:58.433 --> 50:01.560
I'll let the ambassador tell you
what we have in mind.
