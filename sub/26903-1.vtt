<i>Hey Paula, can I grab you
real quick?</i>

01:00.661 --> 01:02.594
Yeah.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.396
What's up?

01:04.432 --> 01:06.376
We're on deadline to get
the McHenry Auction Catalogue

01:06.400 --> 01:07.633
on the site.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.401
I'm still not sure
about this lamp.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.270
Well, what does
Mrs. McHenry say?

01:11.305 --> 01:13.338
She says it's a real Emily.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.152
The family story goes that
her Great Grandmother got it

01:15.176 --> 01:17.342
for a wedding present back East.

01:17.378 --> 01:20.145
Somehow, made the trip
to St. Louis in one piece.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.384
Well, colour looks good.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.986
Nice patina on the brass.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.056
You hear that?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.357
Is it broken?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.526
They used to use wax to hold
the panels together,

01:34.562 --> 01:37.930
as they wax dries over the years
the panels loosen.

01:37.965 --> 01:41.100
If it didn't rattle, you'd know
the lamp was a fake.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.634
So, rattling's good.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.002
Yep.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.238
You can tell Mrs. McHenry
that her Great Grandmother

01:46.273 --> 01:49.108
got a very nice wedding present.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.143
Thanks.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.866
Aunt Jane!

02:13.901 --> 02:16.401
Hey, how is my favourite niece
doing this evening?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.104
She's trying to figure out
how to make room

02:19.140 --> 02:23.008
for all of her Christmas
decorations.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.788
Yeah, well your places
looks more festive every year,

02:24.812 --> 02:26.292
I wish I was there to help you,
honey.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.646
<i>Me too.</i>

02:27.681 --> 02:29.781
<i>Wait, is that the harbour
I'm hearing?</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:31.061
<i>You've come up for air
from your writing desk?</i>

02:31.085 --> 02:32.251
<i>Is that a good sign!?</i>

02:33.187 --> 02:34.887
It's a very good sign!

02:34.955 --> 02:36.722
You finished your book!

02:36.757 --> 02:37.856
I did, I did!

02:37.892 --> 02:39.791
And I wanted you to be
the first to know.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.561
That's amazing, congratulations.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.197
Thanks so much, I just sent
it off to my editor

02:45.232 --> 02:47.966
and I'm sure she'll have some
things to say about it

02:48.002 --> 02:49.668
but I feel really hopeful.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.370
I'm sure it's gonna
be wonderful.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.671
When do I get to read it!?

02:54.108 --> 02:56.141
Gee, that's actually
why I'm calling you,

02:56.177 --> 02:58.610
I'm trying to tempt you
to come to Nantucket.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.513
So beautiful with the holidays
coming and, I don't know,

03:01.549 --> 03:03.382
you can read it
while you stay at my house?

03:03.450 --> 03:04.616
<i>I wish.</i>

03:04.652 --> 03:07.719
I'm up to my neck
in this McHenry Auction.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.021
<i>You can bring Daniel,</i>

03:09.056 --> 03:10.989
I mean when was the last time
you two got away?

03:11.058 --> 03:12.191
Too long.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.358
Yeah, exactly.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.527
So, come, come see me.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.063
I'll speak to Daniel.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.098
Good!

03:19.166 --> 03:20.799
You do that and call me back,
okay?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.467
<i>You alright?</i>

03:22.503 --> 03:24.736
Yeah... I'm good.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.605
Okay, I love you sweet stuff.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.472
I love you.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.242
<i>Buh-bye.</i>

03:43.524 --> 03:44.923
Daniel, hi.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.458
Hey.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.361
Sorry your assistant said you
were just finishing up in here?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.496
You didn't get my message?

03:51.565 --> 03:52.698
Really?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.633
You really should check
your phone more often.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.379
Well, if I check my phone
then I know you were cancelling

03:56.403 --> 03:57.736
and then I would never come here

03:57.771 --> 03:59.049
and then I'd never get
a chance to see you.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.739
That makes sense.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.610
So what's on the docket that's
so important Mr. Counsellor?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.645
I got slammed
with this Hodges case-

04:06.680 --> 04:08.391
I still have a dozen depositions
to schedule

04:08.415 --> 04:09.715
assuming their lawyer
doesn't ask

04:09.750 --> 04:12.050
for another continuance.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.586
Which is way too much
information.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.387
Just a...

04:16.423 --> 04:17.822
I really am sorry about lunch.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.459
Well, can I at least take you
for coffee?

04:20.494 --> 04:22.539
We can go downstairs,
won't even have to take you out

04:22.563 --> 04:23.829
into the snow.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.497
There's snow outside?

04:25.566 --> 04:26.865
You...

04:28.235 --> 04:30.302
So, Aunt Jane finally finished
her book.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.704
She was wondering if we could
make it to Nantucket

04:32.740 --> 04:35.407
before the holidays
so I could read it.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.309
Can't she just email us a copy?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.345
Kind of missing the point.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.782
Come on, you, me, Nantucket,
romantic getaway.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.550
No, I get it.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.464
But the way this case is looking
I'm gonna be working weekends

04:47.488 --> 04:48.920
right up to the holidays.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.089
And don't you have the McHenry
Auction to prep?

04:51.158 --> 04:53.458
Yeah, but I feel like
you've been working so hard

04:53.494 --> 04:54.660
you could use the break.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.028
We both could.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.596
Believe me, I know.

05:05.673 --> 05:09.741
I gotta say Gery, Christmas has
become a whole lot more festive

05:09.810 --> 05:12.811
around here since
you bought this place.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.813
It's a labour of love.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.448
I hope you worked up
an appetite.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.518
Today I got a big pot of lentil
and chestnut soup on the stove.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.453
Sounds perfect.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.754
What do ya think?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.056
It's beautiful!

05:24.091 --> 05:25.390
Yeah.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.337
It's starting to feel a little
bit like Christmas.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.927
Ho-ho-ho!

05:33.167 --> 05:35.667
So, how's the cherub festival
prep going?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.881
Well, we still got a long way to
go to get the youth centre ready

05:37.905 --> 05:39.771
and Christmas is just
around the corner.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.606
You and that Christmas
spirit of yours

05:41.642 --> 05:42.774
will get it done.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.909
You always do.

05:43.977 --> 05:47.446
So... what're you gonna do
for Christmas?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.459
Well, after the cherub festival
I guess I'll just be back here

05:49.483 --> 05:51.049
looking after the place.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.551
You should come over
to the house.

05:52.586 --> 05:53.852
Join us for dinner.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.187
Dorothy, that's sweet
but your...

05:55.222 --> 05:56.521
Your family's gonna be there

05:56.557 --> 05:57.767
and you're gonna need a break
from this place.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.257
Christmas is about being
with them.

05:59.293 --> 06:02.060
Christmas is about being with
the people that we care about

06:02.129 --> 06:03.995
and that includes you.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.164
No one should be alone
for Christmas,

06:06.200 --> 06:07.933
especially after a divorce.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.034
I know.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.303
But I'll be fine.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.839
Well, the offer's still open
if you change your mind.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.273
Thank you.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.878
So, I found this open
store front

06:19.947 --> 06:23.215
that would actually be perfect
for a little antique shop.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.251
I thought you decided
not to open a shop a while ago.

06:26.286 --> 06:30.021
Well I did, it's just the bakery
on Jefferson closed down so-

06:30.057 --> 06:31.968
Well, you know how impractical
those little shops are

06:31.992 --> 06:34.104
and most of them don't even make
it past the first year.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.427
I know, I just-

06:35.496 --> 06:37.929
I thought you liked working
at the auction house?

06:37.965 --> 06:41.900
Well I do, but, sometimes I feel
like I spend all my time

06:41.969 --> 06:44.936
reviewing reports and doing
inventories on these huge estate sales

06:44.972 --> 06:48.340
and it feels more like I'm in
a factory than anything else.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.175
Weren't they talking about
moving you up?

06:50.244 --> 06:51.777
You'd have your own department
to run.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.178
It'd be like owning
your own place

06:53.213 --> 06:56.314
but you wouldn't have to build
it from the ground up.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.250
I'm just gonna go look at it.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.484
Alright.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.953
Let me know how it goes.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.423
What time are your parents
coming over for dinner tonight?

07:04.491 --> 07:06.825
I was thinking about that
and I don't want you to have

07:06.860 --> 07:08.293
to spend the whole
night cooking.

07:08.362 --> 07:09.528
So, I made reservations.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.996
What?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.876
Yeah, my parents only come
into town once or twice a year

07:12.900 --> 07:14.778
and they'd much rather spend
the evening talking

07:14.802 --> 07:17.135
versus watching us run back
and forth to the kitchen.

07:20.441 --> 07:24.276
The office really can't live
without you, can they?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.911
That was me.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.181
I'm sorr...

07:29.216 --> 07:30.615
You set an alarm?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.117
I will pick you up at 7:00.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.386
My parents and sister
will meet us there.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.563
There they are.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.309
We were beginning to wonder
what happened to you two.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.799
Sorry everybody, it's my fault.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.100
Got held up at the office.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.002
My big brother working late,
what are the odds?

07:52.005 --> 07:52.971
Sis, how you doin'?

07:53.006 --> 07:53.805
I'm hungry.

07:53.841 --> 07:54.884
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

07:54.908 --> 07:55.874
Merry Christmas.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.242
Paula, seems like forever.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.643
It's good to see you, Robert.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.378
You look beautiful, Paula.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.080
Thank you, so do you.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.515
I really need to talk to you.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.249
Later.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.150
Yeah, sure.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.551
Welcome.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.086
Cheers everyone.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.155
<i>Cheers.</i>

08:17.898 --> 08:19.064
Need any help?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.700
No, I'm good, thank you.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.735
Just finishing up.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.069
Great.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.144
Then you can help me fold
the rest of these napkins.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.251
I'm not sure I should
be enabling

08:28.275 --> 08:30.275
this little napkin obsession
of yours.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.643
It's festive.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.578
I tell you what, if you fold
30 of them,

08:33.614 --> 08:36.748
I'll tell you what
tomorrow's soup is before I go?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.015
Deal.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.720
If I could have everyone's
attention, please.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.322
As you all know, if there's
one thing that Paula likes

08:44.358 --> 08:47.325
more than Christmas and
antiques, it is cooking.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.729
And when Paula cooks,
she really, really cooks.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.764
Stop!

08:52.866 --> 08:54.277
So, I decided to have dinner
here to make sure

08:54.301 --> 08:55.845
that I could have her
undivided attention

08:55.869 --> 08:58.103
when the time was right.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.206
Paula, when I first met you,

09:01.275 --> 09:04.276
something told me that you were
the girl of my dreams.

09:04.344 --> 09:08.480
And after these years together
I'm sure of it.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.493
I can't think of a better
Christmas gift than to know

09:10.517 --> 09:13.852
that we'll spend every
Christmas together from now on.

09:17.024 --> 09:21.526
Paula, will you marry me?

09:30.604 --> 09:31.570
Yes.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.771
Yes!

09:35.275 --> 09:36.608
I'm getting married!

09:38.045 --> 09:39.678
We need some champagne.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.347
Congratulations!

09:41.381 --> 09:42.981
Thanks Dad, thank you,
thank you.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.151
<i>You've been quiet.</i>

09:47.187 --> 09:49.754
I think I'm still in shock.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.290
Can I take that as a good thing?

09:52.326 --> 09:54.292
Yeah.

09:54.328 --> 09:57.362
So, you're gonna turn this place
into a winter wonderland.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.965
Well, Christmas is coming.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.100
No kidding.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.836
Okay, Mr. Scrooge, I thought
you were looking forward

10:04.871 --> 10:06.972
to all the Christmases
we'd be spending together

10:07.040 --> 10:08.106
once we were married?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.641
Absolutely.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.143
I just don't know if there's
room for all this holiday cheer.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.445
What do you mean!?

10:13.513 --> 10:15.013
Well, my place is a lot smaller

10:15.048 --> 10:17.482
so it's gonna be a pretty tight
squeeze when you move in.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.286
When did we decide that?

10:21.321 --> 10:24.356
Just makes sense.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.058
Well, I - I thought that
we would look for a place

10:27.127 --> 10:29.060
of our own, together.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.663
Well, we'll be buying
at the top of the market

10:31.698 --> 10:33.409
so financially speaking
it makes a lot more sense

10:33.433 --> 10:35.567
to sell this place
and move into mine.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.003
What you just said that
your place is a lot smaller.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.504
Paula, I can't move out here.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.806
The commute would be insane.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.908
It would be insane for me too.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.810
But you wouldn't have
to keep working.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.714
It's not a matter of have to,
it's because I want to.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.849
No, of course not.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.484
It's about stories.

10:52.552 --> 10:56.988
It's about our personal
histories and how these things

10:57.024 --> 10:58.857
take on a life of their own.

10:58.892 --> 11:03.428
It's a memory of a time
where a person,

11:03.463 --> 11:04.963
that really means something.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.498
That's why you wanted
your own shop?

11:06.533 --> 11:09.167
Yeah.

11:10.303 --> 11:14.472
Let's just... take one thing
at a time.

11:14.508 --> 11:18.143
I'm sorry, I did not mean to...

11:18.178 --> 11:20.512
this is not how I wanted
tonight to end.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.416
Clearly, we have some things to
talk about before the big day.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.218
But what happens is that
we love each other.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.920
And the rest, like you said
it's just,

11:28.955 --> 11:30.989
it's one step at a time.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.091
Okay?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.126
Okay.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.268
Hey!

11:43.303 --> 11:44.436
<i>Hey Aunt Jane.</i>

11:44.471 --> 11:47.872
I wanted to give you
the good news.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.275
Daniel asked me to marry him.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.277
That's fantastic!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.312
Congratulations!

11:54.347 --> 11:57.782
Yeah, it really
took me by surprise.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.651
Well, those don't sound like
happy tears?

11:59.686 --> 12:03.688
I don't feel like it either and
I'm trying to figure out why.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.791
<i>I just wasn't expecting this.</i>

12:06.827 --> 12:08.938
Okay, you and I are gonna figure
this out together, okay?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.228
I'm going online right now

12:10.263 --> 12:11.963
and I'm gonna get you
a plane ticket.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.733
<i>Come stay with me,
we'll laugh, we'll cry</i>

12:14.768 --> 12:16.668
<i>and I'll listen to you.</i>

12:16.703 --> 12:18.803
<i>For as long as you need me
to about anything</i>

12:18.839 --> 12:20.405
<i>you want to talk about, okay?</i>

12:22.242 --> 12:23.742
Okay.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.611
Okay, I'll forward the flight
information to you right now.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.179
Thank you.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.259
<i>You're welcome, I love you,
I can't wait to see ya!</i>

12:30.283 --> 12:31.750
Me too.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.463
<i>I'll keep you in my prayers,
honey. See you soon!</i>

12:33.487 --> 12:34.487
Bye.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.426
Jenn, hi!

13:15.462 --> 13:16.728
Hi.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.641
I'm sorry about just dropping in
on you like this.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.042
I thought I'd catch
you before work.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.101
No, it's fine, I...

13:23.136 --> 13:25.470
Sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk yesterday with-

13:26.640 --> 13:28.306
- Everything that was going on.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.108
Totally, I get it.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.278
Are you going somewhere?

13:33.313 --> 13:37.549
That, yeah, no I was
just gonna take a trip

13:37.617 --> 13:39.284
to visit my aunt in Nantucket.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.886
It's like a last-minute thing.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.322
You're not wearing
your engagement ring?

13:44.357 --> 13:47.525
Yeah, I'm just, I'm still,
you know,

13:47.561 --> 13:51.062
trying to get used to it.

13:51.097 --> 13:55.533
He really threw you a curve,
didn't he?

13:55.602 --> 13:56.835
Yeah.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.336
You could say that.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.407
I guess I always thought we
would talk about getting married

14:02.442 --> 14:03.908
but recently it seems like

14:03.944 --> 14:08.179
when Daniel makes his mind up
about something, that's it.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.883
You didn't come here to talk
about me, I'm sorry.

14:11.952 --> 14:12.650
What's going on?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.252
Please, come in.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.389
Well, I have been looking
for a job this summer

14:18.425 --> 14:22.527
and Daniel pulled some strings
and got me a really great job

14:22.562 --> 14:23.962
at a really good law firm.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.297
It's a great opportunity.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.532
But?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.468
I'm just not sure that's
what I want to do.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.104
A friend of mine works for
a marine biology boat

14:33.173 --> 14:34.472
down in Florida.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.908
They save marine life and help
preserve coral reefs

14:36.943 --> 14:40.078
and she said a crew position
might be opening up.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.747
But how much do you know about
marine life and coral reefs?

14:42.782 --> 14:43.782
Not a thing.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.629
Well, I mean it's a lot
different than working

14:46.653 --> 14:47.653
in a law firm.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.087
It is.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.688
But I'd actually get to see
the world,

14:50.724 --> 14:52.290
before I figured out what it is,

14:52.325 --> 14:54.158
I wanna do with my life.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.294
So, what should I do?

14:56.329 --> 14:59.530
Well, you need to have a
conversation with Daniel

14:59.599 --> 15:02.400
and tell him how
you honestly feel.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.435
Like how you're gonna tell him?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.151
Mine and Daniel's relationship
isn't going to change

15:09.175 --> 15:10.675
over the weekend.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.089
And right now, I'm just looking
forward to spending some time

15:13.113 --> 15:16.848
with my aunt, she...

15:16.917 --> 15:19.784
she has a way of seeing things
more clearly.

15:19.819 --> 15:23.321
You focus on you and we'll talk
when I get back, okay?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.056
Thanks.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.691
Come here.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.766
Welcome to Charlotte Inn, folks.

15:34.801 --> 15:35.912
So why don't you go on in inside

15:35.936 --> 15:37.735
and get you checked in
in just a minute.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.138
Hey, Vern said that package
that you ordered

15:40.173 --> 15:41.717
came in a day early
on this mornings' flight.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.774
That's great.

15:42.842 --> 15:43.953
I'll swing by later
and pick it up.

15:43.977 --> 15:44.876
I'll let him know.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.311
Thanks Buddy.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.090
There's my girl!

16:00.093 --> 16:01.059
Hi!

16:01.094 --> 16:02.060
So good to see you.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.127
It's good to see you.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.763
What a weekend I've got
planned for us!

16:05.832 --> 16:08.967
Walks, fires, food,
lots and lots of antique.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.502
That sounds... great.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.871
Just a little bit of bad news
though with the good.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.217
It's not about your book, is it?

16:15.241 --> 16:16.886
No, everything's fine.
My editor called though

16:16.910 --> 16:18.977
and she needs to talk with me
about the manuscript

16:19.012 --> 16:21.057
because the publishers want
to put it out a little earlier

16:21.081 --> 16:22.513
so that's good.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.015
Okay, well don't worry about me.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.928
No, no, no, you're not gonna
sit around and watch me work,

16:25.952 --> 16:26.884
are you kidding!?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.030
I promised you a great weekend

16:28.054 --> 16:30.288
and I'm gonna give you
a great weekend.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.289
What's this?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.824
Well I was going to surprise you

16:32.892 --> 16:35.304
and go to Martha's Vineyard with
you but just because I can't go

16:35.328 --> 16:36.728
doesn't mean you shouldn't go.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.397
Well, I mean I-I-I've never
been to Martha's Vineyard.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.865
You're gonna love it!

16:40.900 --> 16:43.368
And Edgartown has some of
the best antique shops anywhere

16:43.403 --> 16:44.613
and you're not even
gonna miss me you,

16:44.637 --> 16:46.437
you're gonna be so engrossed
in all of them.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.538
Well, I...

16:47.574 --> 16:49.607
Yes is the word
you're looking for!

16:49.642 --> 16:50.742
Okay.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.221
And you're booked
on the last flight back

16:52.245 --> 16:54.278
so, I'll have a great dinner
waiting for you,

16:54.314 --> 16:55.947
I'll take your bag home with me.

16:55.982 --> 16:56.982
Okay.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.060
Alright, this is me
saying goodbye.

16:58.084 --> 16:58.716
Bye.

16:58.752 --> 16:59.550
<i>Go spend money.</i>

16:59.619 --> 17:00.818
Okay.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.198
<i>Retail therapy,
like I taught you.</i>

17:02.222 --> 17:03.222
<i>Bye.</i>

17:19.372 --> 17:20.605
It's for a good cause.

17:20.673 --> 17:24.175
If you're gonna be on the island
for the holidays.

17:24.243 --> 17:28.046
I'm not but thank you.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.114
You bet.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.786
<i>Good to see you again.
How are the kids?</i>

17:39.159 --> 17:40.159
Hi.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.260
Hi.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.429
Hi.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.708
Do you think you could take me
into town?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.031
Sure thing.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.100
Where you headed?

17:48.134 --> 17:49.600
Edgartown.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.003
I heard there's some good
antiquing there?

17:52.038 --> 17:53.571
Good choice.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.907
Hop in.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.308
Thank you.

18:02.715 --> 18:03.715
Okay.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.387
Sorry, it...

18:10.356 --> 18:11.356
<i>Hang on a sec.</i>

18:23.570 --> 18:24.702
Hey, Kenny.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.871
Did Stacie get my notes
on the grading report?

18:26.940 --> 18:27.940
Thank you.

18:30.877 --> 18:31.877
Pardon me.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.511
Hey Buddy, everything okay?

18:33.580 --> 18:36.247
I don't know, this thing never
breaks down.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.483
Well, let's take a look here.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.750
Okay.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.452
Bye.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.259
You need a new starter, maybe?

18:48.328 --> 18:50.528
Hi!

18:50.597 --> 18:51.329
Hey.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.397
I'm sorry about this, ma'am.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.666
Should I get another cab?

18:55.702 --> 18:58.603
Well, if you can find one.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.705
Keep pretty busy this time
of year.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.752
Gery, you know she's
just heading into Edgartown.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.276
Would you mind giving her
a lift?

19:05.311 --> 19:06.477
Oh, no I couldn't.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.312
I'm headed that way anyway.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.680
And this might take a while.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.015
Are you sure?

19:11.050 --> 19:12.050
Is it no trouble?

19:12.118 --> 19:14.318
It's no trouble at all.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.655
As long as you don't mind
making a quick stop on the way.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.224
Sure yeah, no problem.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.292
Thank you.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.160
Thanks.

19:22.195 --> 19:22.827
Thank you.

19:22.862 --> 19:23.862
Hey, no problem.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.297
Gery Conover.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.265
Paula Mayor.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.500
Nice to meet you, Paula Mayor.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.668
First time on the island?

19:30.703 --> 19:33.838
I'm just here for the day,
I... my aunt was supposed

19:33.873 --> 19:36.374
to be here she's in Nantucket
but something came up,

19:36.442 --> 19:39.076
so, here I am.

19:40.647 --> 19:45.283
Well, Christmas is a pretty
special time a year around here.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.150
Oh yeah?

19:46.186 --> 19:48.085
How long have you lived here?

19:48.121 --> 19:51.656
Well, only about three years.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.801
But it already feels like home.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.526
Especially around the holidays.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.396
Christmas has a way
of doing that, you know.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.731
No matter where you are
it just...

20:00.767 --> 20:03.401
gives you a sense of home.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.469
That's right.

20:06.639 --> 20:10.374
Thank you, again, for the ride.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.642
This is quite the car.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.756
It belonged to my Grandfather.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.012
He bought it brand new.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.447
Right off the show room floor.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.184
It still looks brand new.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.530
It's one of my favourite things
to do,

20:21.554 --> 20:24.288
looking after this old beauty.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.001
Are you okay if we stop by
the Youth Centre?

20:26.025 --> 20:26.824
Oh, yeah.

20:26.859 --> 20:27.859
It'll only take a second.

20:27.927 --> 20:28.927
<i>No problem.</i>

20:35.101 --> 20:36.512
I bet you didn't know you'd be
seeing the vineyard

20:36.536 --> 20:39.136
in a genuine Detroit classic?

20:39.172 --> 20:43.107
No, I, did not.
Lucky me.

20:43.176 --> 20:46.777
Actually, this got here a day
early so you really are lucky.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.679
Well, it's all in the timing.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.481
That is what they say.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.325
Ooh, look at all of this!

21:01.361 --> 21:03.294
Hey Gery, did you bring them?

21:03.329 --> 21:04.428
<i>She's so excited.</i>

21:04.464 --> 21:06.063
Hi Katie, you better believe
I did.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.298
Who's that?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.267
This is Paula.

21:09.302 --> 21:12.069
She's visiting the island
for her very first time.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.404
Hi.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.641
Come see the baskets.
They're the best ones ever.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.277
Oh my gosh, those are
the best ones ever.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.712
They're so good, the kids
are gonna love them.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.649
And, look what I got.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.285
Those are the cutest.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.386
Yeah, they sure are.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.754
There's more on the way.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.933
This friend of mine
from the Mainland

21:30.957 --> 21:32.890
donated a bunch for the kids.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.893
And we get to decorate them
anyway we want.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.530
You know, when I was your age,
my mom used to call me

21:39.565 --> 21:41.565
the Christmas decorating queen,

21:41.634 --> 21:44.268
'cause I would cover the house
in homemade decorations.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.805
Mine taught me how to make
snowflakes yesterday.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.773
Right mom?

21:48.808 --> 21:50.741
That's right, sweetie.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.843
That is a great cameo brooch.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.612
Thank you.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.414
My Grandmother gave it
to me ages ago.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.517
It was really popular
in the '30's.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.018
If you ever want to clean it,

22:01.087 --> 22:02.553
just use a little
white toothpaste

22:02.588 --> 22:04.855
with a soft brush
over the white shell

22:04.891 --> 22:06.190
and it will brighten
it right up.

22:06.259 --> 22:10.227
Really? Toothpaste...
I had no idea.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.166
Cherub Christmas festival.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.645
I've been seeing these
all of the airport.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.402
Yeah, we have Gery
to thank for that.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.905
He handles all the fundraising,
among other things.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.174
No, everyone pitches in
to make it happen.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.443
Well, it seems like everybody's
really into it.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.677
Yes!

22:26.713 --> 22:29.447
And we're keeping you
from your antique shops.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.881
So, we're gonna go.

22:30.917 --> 22:31.849
I'll be back later.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.084
Okay.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.985
It's nice to meet you, Katie.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.155
<i>Are you sure I can't just drop
you at the shops?</i>

22:38.191 --> 22:40.391
<i>No, no, I've put you out
of your way enough,</i>

22:40.426 --> 22:42.259
<i>I can just walk from here.</i>

22:44.731 --> 22:46.764
This is beautiful!

22:47.934 --> 22:50.501
It's like a Christmas card.

22:50.536 --> 22:54.372
Yeah, the house was actually
built in 1866.

22:54.407 --> 22:57.641
It belonged to a whaling-ship
owner and then in 1934,

22:57.677 --> 23:01.846
Charlotte Pent bought it
and turned it into an inn.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.081
The Charlotte Inn.

23:04.117 --> 23:05.249
You're quick.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.520
Unfortunately she was
unable to keep up

23:09.589 --> 23:11.255
with the repairs and it kind of
fell apart

23:11.290 --> 23:12.890
and then about three years ago,

23:12.925 --> 23:15.593
it was completely renovated
to its original beauty.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.329
You sure know a lot about it.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.297
Yeah, I did the renovations.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.666
You work here?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.069
Technically I own the place
but yeah,

23:25.138 --> 23:27.471
you could say that my work
is never done.

23:27.507 --> 23:33.144
You, you sure have a talent
for restoring things.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.446
I don't know about talent,
but I definitely enjoy it.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.292
Something kind of special
about breathing new life

23:37.316 --> 23:38.849
into old things.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.158
Yeah. It's a way to thank those

23:40.219 --> 23:42.186
who took care of the things
before us

23:42.221 --> 23:44.021
and a way to pass them along

23:44.090 --> 23:47.258
to whoever will care
for them after us.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.059
That's right.

23:53.366 --> 23:54.366
Antiques.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.766
Of course, yeah

23:55.802 --> 23:58.135
you just shoot right back
down this road,

23:58.204 --> 23:59.537
take a right at the sign and-

23:59.572 --> 24:00.704
Hi Gery!

24:02.141 --> 24:03.474
Who's your friend?

24:03.543 --> 24:05.176
Dorothy, this is Paula.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.221
She's visiting the island.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.311
Hi.

24:07.346 --> 24:08.546
Hi, welcome.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.014
Thank you.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.527
This is the best time
of year to be staying with us.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.551
You'll love it.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.652
I'm not staying here I'm just...

24:14.720 --> 24:16.053
here for the day.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.656
Well why don't you come in
and have a look around?

24:18.691 --> 24:20.891
I just finished preparing
my soup of the day.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.027
I'd love to but I don't
wanna be a burden,

24:23.062 --> 24:24.328
I should-

24:24.363 --> 24:25.830
Nonsense.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.177
I'm told I make the best soup
outside of Santa's Workshop.

24:28.201 --> 24:31.168
You're gonna have
to eat eventually, right?

24:31.237 --> 24:34.104
Yeah. Eventually.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.840
Then it's settled.

24:35.875 --> 24:36.875
Settled.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.576
Settled.

24:38.611 --> 24:39.877
I'm just-

24:39.912 --> 24:41.523
I'll make a quick phone call
and I'll meet ya inside.

24:41.547 --> 24:42.947
Sounds good.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.595
Hey, Paula, I'm sorry
I can't talk right now,

24:57.630 --> 24:59.497
this Hodges case just blew up
in our faces.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.865
<i>I may have to fly to New York.</i>

25:02.335 --> 25:06.737
That's sorry,
I... I...

25:06.772 --> 25:09.373
I will call you
as soon as I can.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.442
Okay, yeah. That's fine.

25:11.477 --> 25:12.710
Love you.

25:15.248 --> 25:16.614
Bye.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.916
I guess.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.594
I grew up in St. Louis.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.497
My mom worked in the main branch
as a librarian

25:33.533 --> 25:36.467
it was one of those, big old
buildings they used to make,

25:36.536 --> 25:38.180
you know, the kind that
you would just get lost

25:38.204 --> 25:39.670
in all of the books.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.005
It sounds great.

25:41.073 --> 25:44.308
I used to spend hours
just exploring the shelves.

25:44.343 --> 25:45.876
And you still live
in St. Louis?

25:45.912 --> 25:50.548
Yeah, I moved back after I graduated
with no idea what was next.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.716
I mean, what do you do
with a history degree.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.364
I guess that depends on
what got you interested

25:55.388 --> 25:56.921
in the first place?

25:56.956 --> 26:01.492
I always had this fascination
with different times.

26:01.527 --> 26:02.560
You know?

26:02.595 --> 26:05.696
How people lived,
what they thought,

26:05.731 --> 26:07.031
what they loved.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.567
I'm assuming that's why
you're interested in antiques.

26:09.602 --> 26:11.068
Probably, yeah.

26:12.505 --> 26:15.739
When I moved back I looked
into teaching... research.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.576
No, no I don't see that for you.

26:18.644 --> 26:22.379
Says the man who's known me
for what, two hours now?

26:22.415 --> 26:24.048
No, I could see you in a museum.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.516
Why do you say that?

26:25.551 --> 26:27.017
Betsy's brooch.

26:27.053 --> 26:29.264
The second you looked at it,
you knew exactly what it was.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.656
Okay... I work in
an auction house.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.458
There it is.

26:34.527 --> 26:36.305
I spend most of my time finding
out whether or not

26:36.329 --> 26:37.861
antiques are real.

26:37.930 --> 26:38.662
I was pretty close.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.531
Close... ish.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.769
I should get going.

26:45.805 --> 26:46.805
Yeah.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.706
I'll walk you to the door.

26:48.774 --> 26:49.974
Okay.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.876
I'm happy that you stayed.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.478
It was nice.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.013
Thank you.

26:57.416 --> 27:01.418
The whole place, you've really
done a wonderful job with it.

27:01.454 --> 27:02.586
Thank you.

27:02.622 --> 27:03.865
Are you sure I can't
give you a lift

27:03.889 --> 27:05.222
to the antique shops?

27:05.291 --> 27:08.726
No, no, honestly,
it's such a short walk.

27:08.761 --> 27:12.596
Anyway, good luck with
your antiquing and whatnot.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.497
Yes.

27:13.566 --> 27:15.165
You know where you're headed?

27:15.201 --> 27:18.469
If I don't, I'll just
call Buddy to pick me up.

27:18.504 --> 27:20.404
Great.

27:20.439 --> 27:24.408
Well, if I don't see you,
Merry Christmas.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.110
Merry Christmas.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.484
I'll get the door.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.221
Take care.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.189
Bye.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.619
Hi.

28:08.654 --> 28:09.553
Hi.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.155
Can I help you find something?

28:11.223 --> 28:13.891
I'm just looking around.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.797
You have a really
lovely shop here.

28:19.832 --> 28:20.998
Thank you.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.477
I've got a little bit
of everything, I guess.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.735
A friend of mine has a place
just like this.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.537
It's packed to the brim,

28:26.605 --> 28:30.040
I think I've lost days in there
helping her catalogue.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.009
Well, it seems like you know
your stuff.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.345
Well, I dabble.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.614
Must be fun having a store
like this.

28:37.650 --> 28:39.683
It has its ups and downs.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.585
There's definitely never
a dull moment.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.332
Let me know if you see something
you like.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.516
Haggling is an old and cherished
tradition around here.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.462
Good... to... know.

28:57.803 --> 29:00.170
I can hear ya thinking
from the kitchen, Gery.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.606
It's just the decorating
for the festival this weekend.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.842
I want there to be something,
I don't know,

29:04.877 --> 29:06.777
special for everyone.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.246
You know something to get
their holiday spirits racing.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.215
I just can't put my finger
on what's missing.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.217
Looked like ya made
a new friend.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.120
Paula?

29:16.188 --> 29:18.355
No, she's just in town
for the day, antiquing,

29:18.390 --> 29:19.957
headed back home
to St. Louis very soon.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.759
Shame you're so busy.

29:21.794 --> 29:25.129
Looked like you two
really hit it off.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.263
Yeah.

29:26.298 --> 29:30.534
No, I mean, but you know,
never stops.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.402
Well, it's the holidays.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.872
Make sure you take some time
to enjoy.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.273
Indeed.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.219
This is a great place.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.354
Thank you.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.700
There are two other shops
down the road

29:51.724 --> 29:53.644
that have some nicely curated
selections as well.

29:54.727 --> 29:56.004
They're the oldest stores
on the island.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.361
Well thanks.

29:57.396 --> 30:00.097
And Merry Christmas.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.099
Merry Christmas to you.

30:17.917 --> 30:21.051
You don't happen to know
if this Currier and Ives print

30:21.086 --> 30:23.086
is an original, do you?

30:23.122 --> 30:24.621
Those just came in this morning,

30:24.690 --> 30:26.590
I haven't even had a chance
to look.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.592
It's in wonderful condition.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.460
I've had a few of them
come through here,

30:30.529 --> 30:33.330
they usually get bought up
right away.

30:33.365 --> 30:34.598
About 75 percent

30:34.633 --> 30:36.178
of the Currier and Ives images
families bring in

30:36.202 --> 30:37.501
are knock-offs

30:37.536 --> 30:38.980
but some of them are
pretty good, they can fool you.

30:39.004 --> 30:39.970
Really?

30:40.005 --> 30:41.305
What gives them away?

30:41.373 --> 30:44.308
Well, the thickness of the paper

30:44.343 --> 30:46.643
but it's hard to tell when
they're in the frame.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.278
You can take it out,
if you like.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.680
You sure?

30:49.715 --> 30:51.748
Please, be my guest,
you've got me all curious now.

30:51.784 --> 30:52.816
Okay.

30:53.886 --> 30:57.187
Sorry.

30:57.256 --> 31:00.023
Speaking of work,
I just, gotta take this.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.695
Hi, Kenny, everything okay?

31:04.730 --> 31:06.130
One of the McHenry's
doesn't want us

31:06.165 --> 31:07.898
to include the estate
jewellery anymore.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.600
Can you hold on a sec?

31:09.635 --> 31:13.704
My advice would be to just
check it out first

31:13.772 --> 31:15.672
before you put a price tag
on it.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.174
Okay thank you very much.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.276
Yeah.

31:19.311 --> 31:19.810
Bye.

31:19.845 --> 31:20.845
Bye.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.279
Kenny.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.160
Hey Buddy, what's up?

31:45.638 --> 31:46.638
I don't know.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.105
I don't know, it just
won't start.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.248
...what do you think?

31:58.317 --> 32:00.183
And how goes the antiquing?

32:00.219 --> 32:03.020
I've actually only got the chance
to look into one store so far,

32:03.055 --> 32:04.721
Past and Presents.

32:04.757 --> 32:05.522
That's nice.

32:05.557 --> 32:06.590
Yeah.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.702
Susanna's only had it
about a year.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.226
She's still trying to make
a go of it.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.796
Yeah, it can be tricky,
having your own shop's a...

32:12.831 --> 32:13.964
lot of balls to juggle.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.198
<i>Free cider for you?</i>

32:15.234 --> 32:16.478
Is that the voice of experience
I'm hearing.

32:16.502 --> 32:20.270
No. I mean not yet.
That is.

32:20.306 --> 32:24.274
I've looked into having
my own shop but-

32:24.310 --> 32:25.575
I even found a store front.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.678
So, what's stopping you?

32:27.713 --> 32:31.882
It's not something you can
just sort of jump into.

32:31.917 --> 32:36.420
That's what they told me
when I bought the Inn.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.022
I like my job at
the auction house.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.358
But sometimes I think
I might be a little

32:41.427 --> 32:44.561
too sentimental with this line
of work.

32:44.596 --> 32:45.862
What's wrong with that?

32:45.898 --> 32:49.700
Well, families bring in
their treasured heirlooms,

32:49.735 --> 32:51.702
passed on from generation
to generation

32:51.737 --> 32:55.872
and I've been known to talk them
out of selling.

32:55.908 --> 32:57.474
That can't be good for business.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.677
No, but, yeah.

33:00.713 --> 33:01.912
Well, you know, some things

33:01.981 --> 33:03.880
are more important than money.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.051
Yeah.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.320
You know it's a shame
you're only staying for the day.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.955
There's so many things
to see here.

33:12.024 --> 33:15.492
The lighthouses, South Beach,
the carousel.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.727
There's a carousel?

33:16.762 --> 33:17.928
Yeah.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.363
It's the most summertime
attraction.

33:19.398 --> 33:20.964
It's just outside of Tisbury.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.870
Paula?

33:26.939 --> 33:28.805
Sorry, the-

33:28.874 --> 33:32.042
That was my mom's favourite
Christmas carol.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.444
We used to sing it all the time
on the way home

33:34.480 --> 33:36.513
from Christmas service.
It's...

33:40.486 --> 33:42.052
I should get to the airport.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.921
Yes, I can give you a lift,
if you like?

33:44.957 --> 33:47.691
Well, thank you... again.

33:47.726 --> 33:48.726
Okay.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.435
Well, I guess this is good-bye.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.503
Again.

34:00.672 --> 34:01.883
You know, unless Buddy's cab
breaks down

34:01.907 --> 34:03.206
in front of the airplane.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.510
Or you're expecting
another package.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.178
- Yeah, no.
- No.

34:10.114 --> 34:13.750
It was nice to meet you, Paula.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.018
It's nice to meet you too, Gery.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.960
- See ya.
- Bye.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.413
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34:43.449 --> 34:45.681
<i>due to severe fog conditions
in Nantucket,</i>

34:45.717 --> 34:47.050
<i>all flights have been cancelled.</i>

34:47.119 --> 34:51.822
<i>Please see agent for re-booking
tomorrow.</i>

34:51.857 --> 34:53.156
Fog?

35:03.535 --> 35:05.335
I heard it on the radio.

35:12.744 --> 35:13.910
Yeah.

35:13.946 --> 35:16.179
They said Nantucket's never seen
such a heavy fog

35:16.215 --> 35:18.415
for this time of year.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.383
Whatever it is,

35:20.419 --> 35:23.386
all flights are cancelled
until tomorrow.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.822
I'm staying at
the Charlotte Inn.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.557
The Charlotte.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.794
That place is booked up months
in advance for the holidays.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.196
Yeah, their main house is booked
but I guess I got lucky

35:33.232 --> 35:34.931
they had a last-minute
cancellation

35:34.967 --> 35:36.500
in the carriage house.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.046
<i>That's a little more
than luck sweetheart!</i>

35:38.070 --> 35:40.837
People reserve the carriage
house like a year in advance.

35:43.408 --> 35:44.841
How'd it go with your editor?

35:44.877 --> 35:46.042
<i>It was great.</i>

35:46.078 --> 35:47.222
I'll tell you all about it
when you get back.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.378
Okay.

35:48.413 --> 35:49.858
They haven't mentioned
when they're gonna open

35:49.882 --> 35:51.481
the airport again
but when they do

35:51.517 --> 35:52.961
I'll be on the first flight
back tomorrow.

35:52.985 --> 35:55.552
Okay, well just text me alright,
I'll... I'll pick you up.

35:55.587 --> 35:56.820
Okay. Love you.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.655
<i>Alright, be safe.</i>

36:13.172 --> 36:13.904
Hi.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.172
Hey.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.107
I brought you a toothbrush
and some other things

36:17.142 --> 36:20.243
I thought you might need, since
you weren't planning on staying.

36:20.312 --> 36:24.781
That is... that's so sweet
of you, thank you.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.249
Just make yourself comfortable

36:26.285 --> 36:28.785
and if there's anything else
you need, just let me know.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.820
Okay.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.655
We serve dinner until 9:00.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.857
In case you're interested.

36:33.926 --> 36:37.727
Yeah, well actually,
you wouldn't happen to have

36:37.796 --> 36:40.463
any of that soup left over
from lunch, would you?

36:40.499 --> 36:41.865
I'll see what I can do.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.533
Okay.

36:43.569 --> 36:44.301
Enjoy.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.336
Yeah.

36:57.249 --> 36:58.381
Excuse me.

36:59.718 --> 37:00.383
Hey!

37:00.419 --> 37:01.451
Hi.

37:01.486 --> 37:02.419
How's the room?

37:02.454 --> 37:04.354
Perfect.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.188
Good.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.056
Yeah.

37:06.091 --> 37:07.524
What's going on in here?

37:07.559 --> 37:09.704
We do this every year,
it's just a little holiday cheer

37:09.728 --> 37:12.195
before we walk down for
the Christmas tree lighting.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.231
Christmas tree lighting?

37:14.266 --> 37:15.266
That's right.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.845
Down at the waterfront, a bunch
of people gather round,

37:17.869 --> 37:20.503
there's carols and lights,
it's fun.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.471
Nice.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.505
<i>Hey Gery!</i>

37:22.541 --> 37:23.340
Could you excuse me,
for one sec?

37:23.375 --> 37:24.375
Yeah.

37:25.377 --> 37:26.377
Hey Paula!

37:26.411 --> 37:27.411
Hi.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.179
Look.

37:29.214 --> 37:32.449
Nice work.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.517
I think it'll be an antique
one day.

37:36.054 --> 37:39.089
Well, I think that maybe
you should sign your name

37:39.124 --> 37:41.391
because when it does become
an antique,

37:41.460 --> 37:42.292
people will know who did it.

37:42.327 --> 37:43.327
Okay.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.397
Hey, Katie, can I see?

37:47.466 --> 37:48.698
Hi, Paula.

37:48.734 --> 37:51.401
So, you gonna come to the tree
lighting with us?

37:52.704 --> 37:54.371
I'll give you a cookie
if you come?

37:57.075 --> 37:58.075
Sold!

37:58.810 --> 37:59.909
It'll be fun.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.422
Come on, I'll introduce you
to everyone.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.013
Okay.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.561
<i>So we've done it every year as
a thank you to the community.</i>

38:06.585 --> 38:12.555
One of my favourite Christmas
traditions is when families

38:12.591 --> 38:16.960
would make their own Christmas
ornaments to hang on the tree.

38:16.995 --> 38:20.397
You mean like fur on strings
and paper chains?

38:21.566 --> 38:25.468
They'd use all kinds of things
like,

38:25.504 --> 38:32.809
branches or pinecones or,
corn husks.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.210
You know.

38:34.279 --> 38:38.248
The point is they would make it
with their hands.

38:38.317 --> 38:39.783
Hey you two, what's up?

38:39.818 --> 38:43.720
Well, just... makin' stars.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.355
That would be nice to do
at the store.

38:45.390 --> 38:46.550
Where'd you learn to do that?

38:48.093 --> 38:50.060
My mom showed me.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.563
Her dad showed her, it's sort of
been a family tradition

38:53.598 --> 38:55.198
that's gotten passed down.

38:55.233 --> 38:56.313
Well, ain't that something.

38:58.804 --> 38:59.804
Merry Christmas.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.576
That's it.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.944
That's it, that's what we do.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.246
That's what's missing,
the old-fashioned ornament,

39:10.282 --> 39:12.916
old Christmas traditions.

39:12.984 --> 39:16.286
An old-fashioned
cherub festival.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.620
Yeah.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.855
I love it.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.268
Best part is, we don't
have to ship anything in

39:20.292 --> 39:21.591
from the Mainland.

39:21.626 --> 39:23.860
Everything we need is
right here on the island.

39:23.895 --> 39:24.627
It's easy.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.663
Yeah, seems easy.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.566
Buddy may need a few
more lessons.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.000
Yeah.

39:31.036 --> 39:31.968
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

39:32.003 --> 39:34.404
<i>it's time for the tree lighting.</i>

39:34.439 --> 39:36.239
Here we go.
Buckle up.

39:36.308 --> 39:37.841
Okay.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.610
<i>Is everyone ready
to light this tree?</i>

39:40.679 --> 39:42.545
<i>Here we go.</i>

39:42.614 --> 39:50.614
<i>10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1!</i>

40:07.305 --> 40:09.239
You're just...

40:19.785 --> 40:22.986
Appreciate the lesson in
'old-fashioned' decorating.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.991
What're ya building over there?

40:28.026 --> 40:29.526
A pinecone.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.727
Okay.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.061
A little bit of white paint.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.430
Okay.

40:33.498 --> 40:34.531
An old canning jar.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.665
I like it.

40:38.503 --> 40:39.402
Voila!

40:39.471 --> 40:40.437
No way.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.671
It's a snow globe.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.142
My mom taught me how
to make these too.

40:46.178 --> 40:50.847
She was always the best at
making the most of Christmas.

40:50.882 --> 40:54.250
I noticed Susanna had
a bunch of old canning jars

40:54.286 --> 40:55.286
in her shop.

40:55.353 --> 40:56.586
Perfect.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.622
I'll pick those up tomorrow.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.424
How're you doing over there?

41:01.460 --> 41:03.359
Very well actually.

41:03.395 --> 41:05.228
Thank you, couldn't be better.

41:05.263 --> 41:06.623
Is this supposed to look
like that?

41:08.700 --> 41:10.433
You build stuff, right?

41:10.469 --> 41:12.235
Yeah, but not out of sticks.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.039
You make it look so easy.

41:19.511 --> 41:22.512
It looks great.

41:22.581 --> 41:26.683
So, three years in
Martha's Vineyard,

41:26.718 --> 41:28.084
what about before then?

41:28.119 --> 41:30.453
Boy, okay.

41:30.522 --> 41:32.989
I grew up in Philadelphia,
huge Philly's fan.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.457
You're kidding?

41:34.493 --> 41:36.025
What?

41:36.061 --> 41:38.795
I went to the University
of Pennsylvania.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.230
So did I.

41:40.265 --> 41:41.931
What?

41:42.000 --> 41:42.799
We could've passed
each other every day

41:42.834 --> 41:44.601
and not even known it.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.202
Okay.

41:46.238 --> 41:49.939
After graduating,
I mean Martha's Vineyard

41:49.975 --> 41:54.177
is a long ways away
from Philadelphia?

41:54.212 --> 41:56.946
It's also a long story.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.748
And complicated.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.296
Hey, can I buy you
a hot chocolate?

42:02.320 --> 42:02.919
Sure.

42:02.954 --> 42:03.954
Good.

42:05.123 --> 42:07.323
You know it's funny,
people always talk about

42:07.359 --> 42:09.726
how beautiful this place is
but they always end up

42:09.761 --> 42:13.162
missing all the little things.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.230
Like fog horns?

42:14.266 --> 42:15.266
Like fog horns.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.401
And how seeing things
a different way

42:18.470 --> 42:21.037
can change the way you look
at them.

42:25.577 --> 42:29.512
I saw this, my first night
on the island.

42:30.482 --> 42:31.915
Now it wasn't Christmas

42:31.950 --> 42:36.419
but all the lights on
the waterfront at night,

42:36.454 --> 42:40.890
just kind of made me feel like
everything would be okay.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.625
So, you stayed.

42:42.661 --> 42:45.728
Yeah.

42:45.764 --> 42:48.498
Like I found another piece
of my puzzle.

42:52.671 --> 42:55.305
It's too bad you can't stay
for the festival.

42:56.942 --> 43:00.443
Yeah...

43:00.478 --> 43:03.246
Maybe next year.

43:03.315 --> 43:05.148
Yeah.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.202
Brought ya some coffee.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.971
You're an angel.

43:28.006 --> 43:30.840
Thanks, Dorothy.

43:30.875 --> 43:34.310
So the fog in Nantucket
has lifted.

43:34.379 --> 43:36.079
Yup.

43:36.147 --> 43:39.649
They're reopening the airport.

43:39.718 --> 43:41.751
That's good.

43:41.820 --> 43:45.088
Well, she hasn't left yet,
you know.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.589
What?

43:46.625 --> 43:50.793
She was up early this morning,
asked me to call her a cab.

43:50.829 --> 43:52.562
Where to?

44:04.409 --> 44:06.209
I brought ya a coffee.

44:06.277 --> 44:08.945
It's pretty cold up here
this time of year.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.680
You came prepared.

44:10.715 --> 44:12.015
Thank you.

44:12.050 --> 44:13.583
When I told you about
the carousel,

44:13.618 --> 44:17.053
I forgot to mention that
it's closed for the winter.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.521
That's okay.

44:18.590 --> 44:21.391
I was just curious.

44:21.426 --> 44:25.962
Well, maybe your Christmas
wish should be that it's open.

44:25.997 --> 44:28.631
Or maybe I just have
really bad timing.

44:31.603 --> 44:34.370
When I was a little girl,

44:34.406 --> 44:37.874
they would always set up
this winter wonderland

44:37.909 --> 44:40.777
during the holidays.

44:40.812 --> 44:45.348
I thought it was so magical,
they had these lights,

44:45.383 --> 44:50.653
decorations, this enormous
Christmas tree.

44:50.689 --> 44:53.256
But my favourite part...

44:53.291 --> 44:54.924
was the Christmas carousel.

44:57.395 --> 45:00.229
Every Christmas Eve, my mom
and I would ride it together.

45:00.265 --> 45:04.534
We always picked
the same two horses,

45:04.602 --> 45:06.002
Dancer and Prancer.

45:07.539 --> 45:09.372
Because we pretended
they were reindeer.

45:10.909 --> 45:12.408
We would even bring
little scarves

45:12.444 --> 45:17.814
to wrap around their necks to
keep them warm it was... silly.

45:17.882 --> 45:20.183
But it was wonderful.

45:21.653 --> 45:24.754
That was Christmas to me.

45:24.789 --> 45:27.457
What about now?

45:27.492 --> 45:31.561
My mom passed away
two years ago.

45:31.596 --> 45:36.432
I haven't been to
a carousel since.

45:36.501 --> 45:39.469
I'm sorry.

45:39.504 --> 45:42.038
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.640
I don't know, maybe I

45:47.078 --> 45:50.480
just want you to know something
about me,

45:50.515 --> 45:55.785
something I don't usually
tell people.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.186
Thank you.

45:57.255 --> 45:58.255
Yeah.

45:59.591 --> 46:03.493
They reopened the airport.

46:03.561 --> 46:05.061
Guess you got a flight to catch.

46:05.096 --> 46:06.096
Yeah.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.235
I have no service up here
so I can't check in.

46:13.605 --> 46:15.138
You can use the computer
in my office.

46:15.173 --> 46:16.873
Ok.

46:16.908 --> 46:18.007
We should go.

46:18.042 --> 46:19.275
Yeah.

46:25.150 --> 46:26.649
Thank you.

46:40.832 --> 46:41.998
And there you are,

46:42.033 --> 46:43.210
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need anything.

46:43.234 --> 46:45.868
Thanks, this shouldn't take
too long.

46:56.381 --> 46:57.713
Okay.

47:09.160 --> 47:12.929
Yes, we got some of what you're
looking for right on the shelf.

47:12.964 --> 47:14.497
Good morning.

47:14.532 --> 47:15.097
Paula.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.232
Good morning.

47:16.301 --> 47:18.000
I didn't think I'd see you
again so soon.

47:18.069 --> 47:21.971
Yeah, I was just curious
If you had found out anything

47:22.006 --> 47:23.773
about the Currier
and Ives print?

47:23.808 --> 47:25.374
Actually, I reached out
to some people

47:25.410 --> 47:27.743
and I went on the internet.

47:27.779 --> 47:30.613
Here, have a look.

47:30.648 --> 47:32.148
Okay.

47:32.183 --> 47:34.595
I remember what you were saying
about the thickness of the paper

47:34.619 --> 47:36.319
so I took it out of the frame.

47:36.387 --> 47:37.787
Tell me what you think.

47:37.822 --> 47:40.690
Well, it feels good.

47:40.758 --> 47:43.392
One other way you can tell
is by the pigment.

47:43.428 --> 47:45.461
Yeah, I was reading that
the originals were

47:45.496 --> 47:47.630
all individually hand-coloured.

47:47.665 --> 47:49.699
If you look close enough,

47:49.734 --> 47:53.402
I think that those are
brush strokes.

47:53.438 --> 47:55.037
<i>I don't know, I could be wrong.</i>

47:55.073 --> 47:58.507
Not at all.

47:58.576 --> 48:02.011
This is one of the best
I've ever seen.

48:02.046 --> 48:05.715
I was hoping that
you would say that.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.016
I would like to buy it.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.484
Really?

48:08.519 --> 48:12.355
Yeah, actually I'm getting
on a plane shortly,

48:12.390 --> 48:14.001
would you mind putting it
in a frame for me

48:14.025 --> 48:15.124
and having it delivered?

48:15.159 --> 48:16.492
Absolutely.

48:16.561 --> 48:19.028
But, only if you let me give you
a 25 percent discount.

48:20.465 --> 48:22.243
I've been so busy trying to sell
the store that I doubt

48:22.267 --> 48:25.301
I would have even had time
to check if it wasn't for you.

48:25.336 --> 48:28.804
You're thinking
of selling the store?

48:28.873 --> 48:32.642
Yeah, it's only been a year
but I just don't have

48:32.677 --> 48:34.577
the passion for antiques
that someone needs

48:34.612 --> 48:36.812
to keep a place like
this running.

48:36.848 --> 48:38.514
Yeah.

48:38.583 --> 48:41.651
Yeah, it's a,
it's a lot for sure.

48:41.686 --> 48:45.221
And that is why I appreciate
someone like you who does.

48:46.424 --> 48:49.458
Okay, I will have this delivered
later today.

48:49.494 --> 48:51.627
Actually...

48:51.696 --> 48:54.163
Could you have that
delivered tomorrow?

48:54.198 --> 48:55.932
Sure, no problem.

48:55.967 --> 48:58.034
So, what is the address?

49:37.809 --> 49:39.041
We went for a walk last night.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.643
Yeah.

49:40.678 --> 49:44.981
And the way the Christmas lights
sparkled off the water was...

49:45.016 --> 49:47.783
so beautiful.

49:47.819 --> 49:49.352
He wanted me to stay.

49:49.387 --> 49:50.519
Ah-ha.

49:50.555 --> 49:52.321
And did you want to stay?

49:52.357 --> 49:53.357
Yeah.

49:55.927 --> 49:57.159
No.

49:57.195 --> 50:00.896
I don't know.

50:00.932 --> 50:05.301
I didn't tell him
that I was engaged.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.870
Well, you're not wearing
your ring.

50:07.905 --> 50:12.742
Are you still engaged
to Daniel, honey?

50:12.777 --> 50:14.977
I love Daniel, I do.

50:16.147 --> 50:18.848
He asked me to marry him
and I said yes.

50:18.883 --> 50:20.716
I know what you need right now.

50:20.785 --> 50:25.021
You need a great walk,
with a fabulous aunt.

50:26.457 --> 50:27.990
And I happen to know
one personally.

50:28.026 --> 50:29.959
Come on, lets get some
fresh air.

50:31.896 --> 50:34.096
It wasn't easy moving away
from home

50:34.132 --> 50:36.999
and leaving you and your mom.

50:37.035 --> 50:39.101
But when I married
your Uncle Mike,

50:39.137 --> 50:41.737
we made a promise
to one another.

50:41.773 --> 50:46.075
So, when he got the job offered
to come here to Nantucket,

50:46.110 --> 50:50.212
well, it was like a big ol' leap
of faith for us.

50:53.584 --> 50:55.818
I know how much you miss him.

50:55.853 --> 50:57.887
Every day.

50:57.922 --> 51:00.322
But you know what, when
things like that happen,

51:00.358 --> 51:03.592
big things like moving
across the country.

51:03.628 --> 51:06.295
You know it's important
to try to see things

51:06.330 --> 51:08.898
in a different light.

51:08.933 --> 51:10.099
What do you mean?

51:10.134 --> 51:13.169
Well, sometimes God
does not speak to us

51:13.204 --> 51:15.404
in a voice that we can hear.

51:15.440 --> 51:18.374
Sometimes, God winks.

51:22.847 --> 51:25.681
Mom always talked
about Godwinks.

51:25.750 --> 51:28.350
Yeah, well, we grew up that way.

51:28.386 --> 51:29.985
We knew that when things
happened to us

51:30.021 --> 51:32.054
that we didn't understand,

51:32.090 --> 51:35.724
it was really a way of
getting our attention

51:35.793 --> 51:40.262
and moving us, guiding us,
onto the right path,

51:40.331 --> 51:41.197
you know?

51:41.232 --> 51:42.631
A better one.

51:45.536 --> 51:51.173
So, you think everything that
happened this weekend is...

51:51.209 --> 51:52.408
God winking at me?

51:54.178 --> 51:57.113
How many things had to happen
in just the right ways

51:57.181 --> 51:58.881
at just the right time?

51:58.950 --> 52:01.450
So that you and Gery could get
to know each other.

52:01.486 --> 52:03.419
It's kind of miraculous.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.061
So, what am I supposed
to do now?

52:12.096 --> 52:17.166
Just, call off the engagement?

52:17.201 --> 52:19.602
Only you can figure out
what happens next, honey

52:19.637 --> 52:22.271
and it's not going
to happen here.

52:22.306 --> 52:25.074
It's gotta happen right here.

52:25.109 --> 52:27.510
In that beautiful heart
of yours.

52:27.545 --> 52:31.213
Listen to it, it will tell you.

52:31.249 --> 52:32.181
I love you.

52:32.216 --> 52:33.182
I love you.

52:33.217 --> 52:34.650
So big.

52:34.685 --> 52:37.520
Remember when your mom
used to say I love you so big?

52:39.390 --> 52:42.391
Alrighty, I'm going to go home,
start supper, you comin'?

52:42.426 --> 52:45.394
I'm just going to just
hang back here for a little bit.

52:45.429 --> 52:46.996
Okay.

52:47.064 --> 52:49.398
Listen to that heart of yours,
honey.

53:26.771 --> 53:28.837
Paula, will you see who that is,
please?

53:28.873 --> 53:31.106
I got scones in the oven.

53:34.879 --> 53:35.879
Daniel!

53:35.913 --> 53:37.046
Hi, Paula.

53:37.114 --> 53:40.282
Come in.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.351
Thanks.

53:44.288 --> 53:45.688
What are you doing here?

53:45.723 --> 53:47.723
I thought I'd come surprise ya.

53:47.792 --> 53:49.191
Yeah...

53:49.260 --> 53:50.537
I have a meeting tomorrow
in New York,

53:50.561 --> 53:54.330
so I took an earlier flight,
so I could see ya.

53:56.267 --> 53:57.900
That is so sweet.

53:57.935 --> 54:00.202
Look what the tide dragged in.

54:01.339 --> 54:03.205
Big guy, how are ya?

54:03.241 --> 54:04.284
It's really good to see you.

54:04.308 --> 54:05.308
You too.

54:05.343 --> 54:06.842
I hear congratulations
are in order?

54:06.911 --> 54:09.378
Yeah, thanks, once she got over
the shock of it she said yes.

54:10.681 --> 54:13.148
Yes, and your timing
is impeccable.

54:13.217 --> 54:15.017
Yeah, I just got some scones
out of the oven

54:15.052 --> 54:16.018
and if you're interested,

54:16.053 --> 54:17.119
I think I could rustle up

54:17.154 --> 54:18.988
a little of that
strawberry jam of mine.

54:19.056 --> 54:20.222
Yum, lead the way.

54:20.258 --> 54:21.258
Come on over.

54:22.727 --> 54:25.038
So, Paula tells me I should
be congratulating you too, Jane.

54:25.062 --> 54:26.028
You finished your book?

54:26.063 --> 54:27.463
Yeah, I sure did.

54:27.498 --> 54:29.732
I was going over some notes
today with my editor.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.634
It sounds like it went
really well.

54:31.702 --> 54:33.469
It did, sweetie, thank you,
yeah.

54:33.504 --> 54:35.504
They're planning on putting it
out in the new year

54:35.573 --> 54:36.639
so that's great.

54:36.707 --> 54:38.018
Well, here's to hoping
that next Summer,

54:38.042 --> 54:39.353
people are reading your book
up and down the beach.

54:39.377 --> 54:42.077
Thank you so much,
from your lips to Gods ears.

54:47.118 --> 54:49.351
Two minutes, I promise.

54:52.657 --> 54:53.422
<i>Hey!</i>

54:53.457 --> 54:54.957
He'll be right back.

54:55.026 --> 54:56.892
<i>So catch me up
on where we're at, okay?</i>

54:56.961 --> 54:58.894
I gotta get ready for church.

55:00.431 --> 55:01.997
<i>No, no...</i>

55:04.935 --> 55:06.935
What's that?

55:07.004 --> 55:10.506
That... is a snow globe.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.741
It doesn't look like
a snow globe.

55:12.777 --> 55:17.313
All it needs is a little
Christmas magic.

55:17.381 --> 55:18.547
<i>Hey, Gery?</i>

55:19.016 --> 55:20.182
Where do you want these?

55:20.217 --> 55:22.084
Right here. Perfect.

55:22.119 --> 55:24.720
Buddy, pinecones.

55:24.755 --> 55:26.822
Lots and lots of pinecones.

55:26.857 --> 55:28.624
Okay, I'm on it.

55:32.096 --> 55:33.228
Hey!

55:33.264 --> 55:34.697
I thought you'd be
out and about,

55:34.732 --> 55:36.899
looking at all the decorations
by now?

55:36.967 --> 55:42.304
Yeah, Daniel's
just had call after call.

55:42.340 --> 55:44.340
Yeah. You alright?

55:44.408 --> 55:46.775
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

55:46.844 --> 55:49.545
I can't believe he came all
the way out here to surprise me.

55:49.613 --> 55:51.613
He used to do things like that
all the time.

55:51.649 --> 55:56.151
I think I just... I've realized
how much I miss that.

55:56.187 --> 55:57.853
I bet you do.

55:57.888 --> 56:00.789
Well you know what tonight is,
Nantucket Christmas stroll.

56:00.825 --> 56:02.825
It's the highlight of the entire
holiday season.

56:02.893 --> 56:05.561
Everybody's gonna be out looking
at the shops and the lights

56:05.629 --> 56:07.796
and all the decorations.

56:07.832 --> 56:11.066
You two need a romantic night
together, you need to go.

56:11.102 --> 56:13.302
I will talk to Daniel
but that sounds nice.

56:13.337 --> 56:14.236
Doesn't it?

56:14.271 --> 56:16.372
So, does a cup of tea.

56:16.407 --> 56:17.407
Yes.

56:26.384 --> 56:27.282
What do you think?

56:27.351 --> 56:28.550
Love it.

56:28.586 --> 56:29.963
Yeah, so the idea is people
can try their hand

56:29.987 --> 56:33.021
at the various vintage crafts.

56:33.057 --> 56:35.224
Well now isn't that lovely.

56:35.292 --> 56:36.492
You hang these on a tree,

56:36.527 --> 56:38.560
Christmas spirit like you
wouldn't believe.

56:38.596 --> 56:40.307
And we help raise money
for the youth centre.

56:40.331 --> 56:41.697
That's wonderful, Gery.

56:41.766 --> 56:43.599
Paula, actually gave me
the idea.

56:43.634 --> 56:46.568
Yeah, it is pretty wonderful,
isn't it?

56:46.637 --> 56:47.836
I almost forgot.

56:47.872 --> 56:49.638
Susanna dropped this off
for you.

56:49.707 --> 56:50.839
What is it?

56:50.875 --> 56:52.875
I thought you'd know?

56:52.943 --> 56:54.710
I didn't buy anything.

56:58.115 --> 57:00.649
Well, would you look at that.

57:02.653 --> 57:06.255
It's from the same series.

57:06.290 --> 57:10.092
These Christmas prints were the
most popular things they did.

57:10.127 --> 57:14.630
I've seen pictures of this one
but never an actual print.

57:14.665 --> 57:16.999
Who's it from?

57:17.067 --> 57:19.001
Good question.

57:21.672 --> 57:24.740
I really am sorry about
all those calls, this meeting.

57:24.775 --> 57:27.609
No. It's important, I get it.

57:27.645 --> 57:29.878
Not as important as you.

57:29.914 --> 57:31.914
I want you to know that.

57:31.982 --> 57:35.250
There's just so much
that I want for us, Paula.

57:35.286 --> 57:40.556
Daniel, just this, here,
us alone,

57:40.591 --> 57:44.059
I can't remember the last time
that that has happened.

57:44.128 --> 57:44.993
That is nice.

57:45.029 --> 57:46.029
Speaking of which.

57:48.432 --> 57:50.699
Yeah.

57:50.768 --> 57:52.734
That's a keeper.

57:52.770 --> 57:55.070
You're not wearing
your engagement ring?

57:55.139 --> 57:57.306
Is something wrong with it?

57:57.341 --> 58:00.576
What, no.

58:00.644 --> 58:02.578
No... no, of course not.

58:02.613 --> 58:04.279
Then why aren't you wearing it?

58:04.315 --> 58:05.614
I...

58:07.151 --> 58:08.984
I just.

58:09.019 --> 58:12.421
This all happened so fast.

58:12.490 --> 58:13.856
We didn't even talk about it.

58:13.924 --> 58:16.358
I guess I was just...

58:16.393 --> 58:18.560
Need a little bit more time
to...

58:18.629 --> 58:21.930
Get used to it.

58:21.966 --> 58:25.334
I... I'm sorry is there
something I'm missing here?

58:25.369 --> 58:29.671
Two years we've been together
and you weren't ready yet?

58:29.707 --> 58:32.608
Daniel, I haven't been wearing
the ring the entire time

58:32.643 --> 58:33.942
that you've been here

58:34.011 --> 58:37.579
and this is the first time
that you've noticed it.

58:37.615 --> 58:42.985
Which means what?

58:43.020 --> 58:44.620
I don't know.

58:44.655 --> 58:47.322
That's the problem, I just...

58:47.358 --> 58:49.258
I feel like we are out of sync,

58:49.293 --> 58:52.528
like we don't know each other
the way that we used to.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.029
I'm sorry.

58:54.098 --> 58:55.375
I didn't want to do
this tonight,

58:55.399 --> 58:56.576
I just wanted us to enjoy this.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.233
I...

58:58.269 --> 59:00.102
I'm sorry too.

59:03.173 --> 59:05.841
I, you know, I've gotta be
up early in the morning,

59:05.876 --> 59:08.310
I should probably get out
of here.

59:08.345 --> 59:10.546
But look, you stay.

59:10.581 --> 59:12.180
Enjoy the rest of this.

59:12.249 --> 59:13.715
Daniel...

59:29.266 --> 59:31.633
You're up early.

59:31.669 --> 59:34.469
Daniel left about an hour ago.

59:34.505 --> 59:35.938
Okay.

59:35.973 --> 59:38.574
And how are you feeling
about that?

59:38.642 --> 59:42.144
I've been sitting here asking
myself the same question.

59:44.214 --> 59:46.915
Honey, I've known you
your whole life

59:46.951 --> 59:49.651
and you have never rushed
into a decision.

59:49.687 --> 59:55.157
But when you make up your mind,
in here, you know it.

59:55.192 --> 59:58.994
Yeah, I'm just...

59:59.063 --> 01:00:02.664
pretty confused as to what's
going on in here right now.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.865
I know.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.934
I know you are but you're
going to be okay.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:07.469
I'm here for you.

01:00:07.504 --> 01:00:09.805
I don't know what I would do
without you.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.973
I don't either.

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:13.408
You'd be lost.

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:14.810
Just like I would too.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.445
I love you baby girl.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.680
So much.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.016
I should get back.

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:22.095
Yes, you should, you have
a plane to catch.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:22.951
Yeah.

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:24.319
Go.

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:25.721
You know you're beautiful,
right?

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:27.968
You know you look
just like your Mother.

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:29.124
Stop.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:31.693
No, I'm not gonna stop,
get outta here.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:38.367
Susanna.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:39.701
Hi, Gery.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:42.537
Did you get the package
that I left with Dorothy?

01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:44.139
That's actually why I'm here.

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:45.285
It's a beautiful print,
isn't it?

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.576
Original Currier and Ives,
hand-painted.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:49.978
It is, except I didn't order it.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:53.248
I just assumed it was
an early Christmas present.

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:54.850
From whom?

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:56.418
She didn't tell you?

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:03.291
Excuse me.

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:16.371
Hello?

01:01:16.407 --> 01:01:18.440
Are you still in Nantucket?

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:19.775
Gery?

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.209
You haven't left yet, have you?

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:22.344
You're still in Nantucket?

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:27.649
No... I mean yeah,
I'm just about to board.

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:30.452
Can you stay, for a bit?

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:31.987
<i>Just for a bit, please.</i>

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:34.456
No, I-I have to go.

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:38.293
No, I know but...
not yet.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.528
Please.

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:40.563
I'm sorry I...

01:01:40.631 --> 01:01:42.597
<i>I can be there in one hour.</i>

01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:43.799
What?

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:46.702
This is... This is crazy,
what do you mean?

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:48.970
There's another flight
in a couple of hours.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.340
<i>What difference is a couple
of hours going to make?</i>

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:54.276
I don't know.

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:58.346
Maybe nothing, but isn't it
worth finding out?

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.816
<i>Paula, please.</i>

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.187
Okay, hurry up.

01:02:06.123 --> 01:02:07.123
Okay.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:40.188
You asked me a question...
that I didn't answer.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:44.392
Right, when I asked you how
you got to the vineyard

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.327
from Philadelphia.

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:46.661
Yeah.

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:48.074
When I was telling you about
my Grandfather's car,

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.699
what I didn't say is my
grandparents raised me,

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:53.835
and my Grandfather,
there wasn't anything

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:55.403
that he couldn't do
with his hands,

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.672
when it came to building
and fixing things.

01:02:57.708 --> 01:03:00.475
Which is how you got so good
at all the renovations.

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:02.377
I got pretty good.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:05.380
But, I felt like I should also
cover my bases.

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.016
So, I studied finance
and money management.

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:10.185
You know, I had a good job
waiting for me

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:14.222
when I graduated and then
about three years later,

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.825
I got married.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.393
You were married?

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:22.397
I mean, that first year we were,
we were really happy.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:23.932
What happened?

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.169
What happened was,
I woke up one morning

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:30.272
and I realized how much I missed
working with my hands.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.275
And then one day I was
walking down the street

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.711
and I looked in the store window
and I saw this print.

01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:39.581
A Currier and Ives
Christmas print.

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.416
The one in your office.

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.086
And I thought well that wouldn't
be so bad, would it?

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:48.256
Living in a place where people
take the time to appreciate

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:51.326
something like a snowy park
on a Christmas day.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:57.265
You um... you bought the Inn

01:03:57.301 --> 01:04:00.368
because of a print you saw
on the window?

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:02.470
I guess that's what it comes
down to, yeah.

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.775
You know weird thing is I lived
in Philly my whole life.

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.744
Never seen that shop. I'd never
even been on that street.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.849
And when I saw that print,
I felt like I had found

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:16.718
a missing piece of my puzzle.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.490
What about your wife?

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:29.231
She came, for a while, stuck it
out but she ultimately wanted

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:31.600
to live in the big city
and I knew in my heart

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:34.569
that that would never
make me happy.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:37.505
So, we signed divorce papers
at the beginning of the year.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:41.843
I'm sorry. I-

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:46.781
Which is... it's not what
I came here to say.

01:04:46.817 --> 01:04:50.452
When I saw that print
that you gave me,

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.422
it was like I was right back
on that street,

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:58.126
looking into that store window.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:02.063
Except you were right there
beside me.

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:04.432
And it just felt right.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:16.611
I'm... I should have
told you this when we met.

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.951
I'm in a relationship.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:28.590
I'm engaged.

01:05:33.664 --> 01:05:34.729
Gery...

01:05:34.765 --> 01:05:37.198
No, no, no, it's okay.

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:42.137
Look, you're an amazing,
beautiful woman.

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:47.108
And it only makes sense that
somebody else found you first.

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.480
I hope he knows how lucky he is.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.454
Merry Christmas.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:00.523
Merry Christmas.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:04.493
Okay.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.800
Good morning.

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:21.703
Hey, how was your trip?

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:24.072
It was good.

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:25.885
I put the appraisal report
for the McHenry watches

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:27.709
on your desk.

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.778
And a box of books came in
last minute.

01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:31.379
I went through most of it

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:33.515
but I left a couple of piles
on your desk

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.950
that I wasn't sure about.

01:07:35.986 --> 01:07:39.854
Kenny, thank you.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:42.957
Welcome back.

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:49.764
Daniel gets in late tonight
from New York.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:52.700
<i>So, what are the two of you
doing for Christmas?</i>

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:55.737
I... I don't know, we actually
haven't talked about it

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:57.872
since he left Nantucket.

01:07:57.941 --> 01:07:59.741
Well, honey it's less
than a week away.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:01.242
I know.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:05.480
I'm sure we'll probably just
have a quiet holiday together,

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:06.915
try to relax a little.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.918
Okay, well you know you're
always welcome here, right?

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:12.720
I know, thank you.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:14.622
<i>You take care and I'll talk
to you soon.</i>

01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:15.857
Okay.

01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:17.358
Okay, bye-bye.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:50.291
How's your aunt?

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:51.725
She's great.

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:52.794
Yeah, it was good.

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:55.196
I saw Daniel for a night.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:56.296
How was that?

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:57.532
Good.

01:08:57.567 --> 01:08:59.267
Yeah.

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:01.202
Was... great.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:04.872
You know, what you said to me
the other day really helped.

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:07.375
Just know yourself, know
what you need to be happy

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:09.377
and stick to it.

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:16.251
It's true.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:19.020
You give good advice Paula.

01:09:19.089 --> 01:09:20.654
Well sometimes.

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:27.935
How are you going there, Buddy?

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.134
This isn't working.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.202
Alright.

01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:36.504
Try it again.

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:37.973
You've got to take it slow,
alright?

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.642
You want to bend it
just enough that...

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:45.747
Not so easy, is it?

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.149
I'm gonna go get some cider.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.220
Hey.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:56.758
Gery, that looks great,
just like how Paula made it.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:59.360
I'll tell ya what...

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:01.262
It's all yours, champ.

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:03.198
Thank you.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:05.900
Is Paula coming to the festival?

01:10:05.936 --> 01:10:07.669
She had to leave.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:09.671
She's spending Christmas
at home.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.573
I'm sorry she won't be here.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:14.242
I really liked her.

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:15.944
Yeah.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:17.612
Me too.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.994
No, no, they already pushed
the deposition back twice.

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:36.831
Let me give you a call back.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.233
I didn't know you were
coming by?

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:41.269
I thought I'd surprise you
this time.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:42.381
I was gonna call you last night.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:43.716
By the time I got in
it was so late.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.240
No, it's okay, I know
you're busy.

01:10:45.308 --> 01:10:46.808
I promise not to stay
too long I just,

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:49.711
I feel like...
I, miss you.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.613
I miss you too.

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.648
You know we haven't talked about
Christmas yet?

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:56.384
I know, what would
you like to do?

01:10:56.419 --> 01:11:00.088
I was thinking that maybe
we could invite Jenn over,

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:01.689
if she doesn't have plans yet.

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:04.158
Yeah, Jenn, you know she called
me early this morning,

01:11:04.194 --> 01:11:06.427
telling me she was going to
spend the holiday this year

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:09.130
with a friend, in Florida.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:13.668
Well, at least the weather
will be nice.

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.069
This isn't funny, Paula,

01:11:15.105 --> 01:11:16.971
we're talking about
my Sister's future.

01:11:17.007 --> 01:11:20.141
Yeah, you're right, her future.

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.988
So, you really think it's okay
for her to just walk away

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:24.112
from a chance at a real career,
which for the record,

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.281
I had to call in a couple big
favours to get for her.

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:28.483
Well, I'm sure she knows that.

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:30.585
Have you thought about
asking her what she wants?

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.298
Apparently, to sit in a boat
in the middle of the ocean

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:33.821
for weeks at a time.

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:38.826
No Daniel, she just wants you
to listen to her, to hear her.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.234
When I fell in love
with you Daniel,

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:51.105
you were the kindest person
that I had ever met.

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:53.975
People mattered to you.

01:11:54.044 --> 01:11:55.677
You cared.

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:56.911
I still care.

01:11:56.946 --> 01:11:58.246
About work.

01:11:58.281 --> 01:12:01.949
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:05.753
But it's not what I want.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:11.592
You're a really good guy,
Daniel.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.367
I'm sorry.

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:26.374
I have to take this call, Paula.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.946
Hey Jim.

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.915
Yeah, we already got the...

01:12:45.328 --> 01:12:47.228
<i>Okay.</i>

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:54.502
Yeah.

01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:57.105
Okay, yeah, I'll give him
a call.

01:12:58.141 --> 01:12:59.474
<i>Hey, Paula.</i>

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:05.279
Hey, is that invitation
to Christmas still open?

01:13:05.315 --> 01:13:06.315
Are you serious?

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:09.550
What about Daniel, sweetheart?

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:15.857
I'll see you after
the McHenry Auction.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:19.093
Okay, I don't know
whether to laugh or cry.

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:24.399
Well, we'll do a little bit
of both.

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:26.601
<i>Okay sweetie, I love you.</i>

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:28.102
I love you too.

01:13:28.138 --> 01:13:29.670
Bye.

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:41.582
Hey.

01:13:41.618 --> 01:13:42.383
No, yeah, I know.

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:45.953
But I think I've got a plan.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.132
Paula!

01:13:58.168 --> 01:13:59.200
Hi.

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:01.235
It's so good to have
you back, honey.

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:02.837
How are you doin'?

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:04.172
Better now.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.208
I just want you to relax
and enjoy yourself, okay?

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:08.776
As of this very moment,
guess what?

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:09.677
What?

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:10.906
You're officially on holiday.

01:14:11.514 --> 01:14:12.625
But we're going to have to hurry

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:14.160
because our plane is boarding
right now.

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:15.349
Wait, what?
Where am I going?

01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:18.085
No, we, we, we are going
to Martha's Vineyard.

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:19.620
No, no, no, I just want to,

01:14:19.656 --> 01:14:23.524
hide under a blanket and read
a book and drink cider.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.993
No, honey, the best remedy
is to go out there and enjoy

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:29.497
all the Christmas that
you can grab in your hands.

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:30.998
It's Martha's Vineyard though.

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:33.935
Martha's Vineyard is where all
the great antique shops are.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.304
We didn't get to make our memory
last time.

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:37.505
It's a big island.

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.373
Everybody's going to be
running around

01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:41.008
with last minute
crazy Christmas stuff.

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:42.210
We are too.
Let's go.

01:14:42.245 --> 01:14:43.311
Come on.

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:44.826
Before you change your mind,
let's go.

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:54.922
Thank you, Aunt Jane,
this is really helping.

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:57.024
Oh gosh, don't mention it,
sweetie,

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.237
I just want you
to enjoy yourself.

01:14:58.261 --> 01:15:00.628
Look, you love those.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.396
I do.

01:15:02.432 --> 01:15:03.931
That's so sweet.

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.070
You lookin' for something?

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:10.105
No.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:10.872
No.

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:12.640
Okay, let's go to Tisbury.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.520
It's the cutest little town,
you're gonna love it.

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.043
Lets grab a cab.

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:17.211
Hi, are you available?

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.112
Yes ma'am.

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:19.547
Great, thank you.

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:20.515
Hi, Paula.

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:21.550
Hey, Buddy.

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:23.050
Where are you two going?

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.286
Tisbury please.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:26.921
Hop in.

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:32.260
Paula?

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:33.295
Yeah.

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:38.032
<i>We gotta go if we want
to get there before dark.</i>

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:49.410
So, you fold the piece of paper
like this and then you cut here,

01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:51.879
here and here.

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:57.184
Okay just make sure that you
squeeze the lid good and tight.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.252
See.

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.254
Mom, look at my tree!

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:02.857
That looks great!

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.358
Let's take a look.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:08.563
Yes, please.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.097
Ah-ha.

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:13.067
Well Gery, it looks like
you did it again.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.703
I couldn't do it
without you, Dorothy.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.171
You know that.

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.673
It's nice, isn't it?

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:21.509
Having everyone together
like this.

01:16:21.544 --> 01:16:23.144
Yeah.

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:40.094
<i>...Good for you.</i>

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.964
So, how was antiquing,
find anything good?

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:43.898
Yeah.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.466
Yeah, I think so.
It was nice.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:47.902
What was that?

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.437
Nothin'.

01:16:57.013 --> 01:16:58.045
Are you sure?

01:16:58.081 --> 01:16:59.914
Yeah, nothing to worry about,...

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:01.649
Probably just the engine.

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:03.417
Well, can you fix it?

01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:07.154
Sure, yeah, just gotta make
a quick phone call.

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.091
Oh, no.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.993
Buddy!

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:15.863
Yeah, it broke down again.

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:16.931
Hey.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.501
Don't-Get off the-
get off the phone.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:21.636
Hold on.

01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:24.038
You know what, I can
see town from here

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:26.374
I think we should go for a cup
of coffee while we wait.

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.442
Don't be silly, he's gonna call
a friend.

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:29.644
No, I-

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:31.646
I definitely think that
we should go for a walk.

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:32.681
Definitely.

01:17:33.049 --> 01:17:35.449
Wait, wait.
It's my editor.

01:17:35.485 --> 01:17:36.984
What?

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.119
Hello?

01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.622
Yes, yes, I'm here.
Can you hear me?

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:43.424
You know what, I'm gonna...

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:44.091
I'm going by myself.

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:45.059
Go, go!

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:48.162
<i>Yes. Hi!</i>

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:49.697
<i>I hear you better over here.</i>

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:50.931
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:54.035
First of all I want to thank you all
for coming tonight

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.536
I hope you're all having
a good time.

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:56.571
- Yes!

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:01.842
Good, good.

01:18:01.878 --> 01:18:05.112
I'm thrilled to announce
that between ticket sales

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:08.683
and your donations,
we have officially met

01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:10.358
our fundraising goal
for the youth centre.

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:19.527
You have given these children a
truly wonderful Christmas present

01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:23.564
and to that I say,
Merry Christmas to all,

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:25.232
and to all, goodnight.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:28.470
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:35.543
Now, go, enjoy yourselves.
Have fun, it's a party.

01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:42.049
Gery, did you turn
your phone off?

01:18:42.085 --> 01:18:43.085
What?

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:45.553
No.

01:18:45.588 --> 01:18:46.721
Well, Buddy just called,

01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:48.856
says he's trying to get
a hold of you.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:49.957
Where is he?

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:50.992
I don't know.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.827
Give him a call.

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:21.689
What's going on?

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:35.003
Paula.

01:19:36.506 --> 01:19:37.506
Gery.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.744
Hi.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:46.847
Hi.

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:51.152
Welcome back.
What-

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:57.825
I was in, Buddy's cab and
then it, it, well broke down.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.494
So I, I saw the lights
on the carousel

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:02.930
but they're not supposed
to be on,

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.198
in the Winter.

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:06.700
No, they're not.

01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:08.836
What are you doing here?

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:11.739
I got a call that Buddy's cab
had broken down...

01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:12.774
Again.

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:19.079
I thought you were spending
Christmas in St. Louis?

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:26.620
Yeah, I was, I mean I did, I was
I was supposed to.

01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:34.656
I just... turns out that's...
not what I wanted at all.

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:39.834
I think I was missing a piece
of my puzzle too.

01:20:50.213 --> 01:20:53.347
His cab seems to be
working just fine.

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.420
Aunt Jane! Hi!

01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:00.988
We're so glad you made it,
Paula.

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:03.591
We were so afraid you were going
to go straight to town.

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:05.726
I'm sorry, you two
know each other?

01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:07.372
Oh, honey, I've been antiquing
here for years

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:09.964
of course I picked up a friend
or two along the way.

01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:15.803
Hi, Gery, it's so nice
to meet you, I'm Jane.

01:21:15.872 --> 01:21:19.206
So, you two gals had something
to do with this?

01:21:19.275 --> 01:21:22.743
Well, you know what,
when God winks at two people

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:24.645
they way he's been winking
at the two of you,

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.581
how could we not notice.

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:28.983
You needed a little nudge.

01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:31.318
With the help of Buddy
and his cab, of course.

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:32.586
It was no problem.

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:35.789
The carousel was a nice touch,
by the way.

01:21:35.825 --> 01:21:37.625
Yeah, let's just say
I was inspired.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:38.859
You?

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:40.072
It took me a while to defrost
the gears

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:42.329
but it should be running
like summertime.

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:44.765
Well, maybe we should go back
and enjoy the festival.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.666
Absolutely.

01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:46.600
But can't we just-

01:21:46.636 --> 01:21:47.501
No, we can't.

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:48.536
Buddy.

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:51.872
Merry Christmas you two.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.507
Merry Christmas.

01:22:00.983 --> 01:22:02.750
Merry Christmas, Paula.

01:22:04.153 --> 01:22:05.920
Merry Christmas, Gery.

01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:26.440
It looks like I got my Christmas
wish after all.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:31.078
I think we have time for a ride.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:35.416
Absolutely.

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:36.884
Shall we?
