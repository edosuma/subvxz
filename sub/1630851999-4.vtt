WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.878
Welcome home!

00:04.879 --> 00:06.631
[Caterina] What is this?

00:06.715 --> 00:07.882
PREVIOUSLY

00:07.966 --> 00:10.385
Did you go back to Eleven O'Clock
without my permission?

00:10.468 --> 00:13.388
Did you do what I asked?
I'm betting my future on this rehearsal.

00:15.473 --> 00:18.560
If I don't manage to join the company,
I won't be able to stop Greta.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.979
<i>And she's going to try to sabotage</i>
<i>my mom in the next rehearsal.</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:23.898
[Cocó] <i>You can't control everything,</i>
<i>Allegra.</i>

00:23.982 --> 00:26.276
-[gasps]
-[Cocó] <i>You have what it takes.</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:30.864
<i>But the most important thing</i>
<i>is to be present in the moment.</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:35.243
You really impressed me.
Welcome to Eleven O'Clock.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.037
Attention.

00:37.120 --> 00:41.416
On opening night, the character of Ellie
will be played by Caterina.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.093
[photographer]
More of that, Cocó. Perfect.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.596
You look amazing. That's it.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.475
Fire. Good, girls.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.643
-Stand up straight. That's it.
-[photographer] Shot. Shot.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.147
-Amazing, girls.
-I like it.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.358
[photographer] That's it.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.526
Turn.

01:09.819 --> 01:10.737
There.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.823
-It's as if they were torturing her.
-[photographer] Are you two ready?

01:14.574 --> 01:17.786
Some have privilege.
Others of us have talent.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.747
And some of us? Have both.

01:20.830 --> 01:21.915
Sorry.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.417
[photographer] One more.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.587
Come on, come on, Caterina,
a little more expression.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.092
No, maybe not. Not that much.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.218
Are we done yet?

01:33.301 --> 01:35.679
[photographer] No, sweetheart.
Give me a minute to change the film.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.805
We're almost there, eh?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.765
[Cocó] It's all knotted here.

01:38.848 --> 01:39.891
Here.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.935
What are you doing, Laura? Move.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.019
I just want to…

01:43.103 --> 01:44.229
You just joined the company,

01:44.312 --> 01:46.356
and you want to interfere
with the stars' photo shoot?

01:46.439 --> 01:47.899
-No, no, no.
-Go away, please.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.275
Look that way, please.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.531
How did Laura find out
about what we were going to do?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.828
You didn't say anything, did you?

02:00.870 --> 02:02.080
What?

02:02.163 --> 02:05.000
I'm perfectly capable of keeping a secret.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.087
Beautiful. Wonderful.

02:09.713 --> 02:14.300
All right, we're here
with the great Cocó Sharp,

02:14.384 --> 02:17.178
just a few days out from the opening
of <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.222
How are you feeling?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.391
I'm very excited.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.853
It's a big challenge for me,
having played the character of Ellie…

02:24.936 --> 02:27.480
-Of course.
-…to play the character of Katherine.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.609
And how does it feel to work together
as mother and daughter?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.445
It's a dream come true.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.281
We've been waiting for this moment
a long time. Right, Caterina?

02:37.615 --> 02:40.035
Honestly, I have no words.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.664
No. It must be her feet probably hurt
from the heels.

02:44.748 --> 02:45.999
I'm sure.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.085
We understand each other really well.
A chip off the old block.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.922
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved me.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.551
If you're talking about the clip,
it wasn't life or death, right?

02:56.634 --> 02:59.596
No, I mean what happened on stage.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.640
If I had fallen through that trap,
I would be in the hospital now.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.225
And I hate hospitals.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.395
-I hate the smell of disinfectant.
-Yes, I know.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.858
-Everyone hates hospitals.
-Yes, that's true.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.610
Anyway, I owe you one.

03:14.235 --> 03:18.531
Well, I couldn't let anything happen
to the next big musical theater star.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.910
[photographer] Find it. Find it.
You've got it. You've got it. It's you.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.704
Good, Cocó.

03:24.788 --> 03:28.792
And to think the first time I saw you,
I thought you were a crazy fan.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.295
Why did you hug me that day?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.633
Because I thought that--

03:36.716 --> 03:39.678
that you had hurt yourself when you fell,
and I was worried.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.348
That's why I like you so much.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.850
No one is like that here.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.853
It's a very competitive world.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.940
Everyone wants to stand out and be seen.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.319
It's nice to meet someone
who's concerned about others.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.364
[Cocó] Caterina, please! We aren't done.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.699
Coming.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.702
I have to go be mini-Cocó. Yay!

04:07.414 --> 04:10.834
Now that you're officially part
of the company,

04:11.543 --> 04:13.461
we can practice the choreography together.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.716
Do you really mean it?
Yes, thank you. I would love that.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.634
All right. Do you want to rehearse
at my house?

04:22.303 --> 04:25.515
-I don't think I can today.
-Okay, some other day. Whenever you want.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.393
Sure. I'll come by another day,
and we can rehearse.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.853
I didn't give you the address.

04:31.438 --> 04:35.358
No. Of course,
because since I'm a crazy fan,

04:35.442 --> 04:39.070
uh, I looked you up online
and I have it all "saved" in my head.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.239
-The map, the GPS.
-GPS?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.534
Great…

04:45.702 --> 04:47.203
person…

04:47.287 --> 04:50.373
s-s-syndrome.

04:51.332 --> 04:56.838
It's an expression.
Like, "You've got GPS!"

04:56.921 --> 04:59.883
You're very strange. But I like it.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.802
Okay. I'll give you the address later.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.388
Bye, GPS.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.436
[sighs] GPS.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.979
[photographer] All right, kiddos,
we ready?

05:13.063 --> 05:14.230
[Bárbara] Think positively.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.651
You'd be a thousand times worse
if Cocó had found out about what you did.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.489
We did.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.992
But just because Caterina
is going to be Ellie on opening day,

05:26.076 --> 05:29.371
it doesn't mean
she'll be Ellie all season.

05:32.207 --> 05:36.169
Hey, sweetie. Don't be naïve.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.713
It's obvious that if Caterina
makes an impression on opening day,

05:38.797 --> 05:40.590
she'll have the role forever.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.384
Greta, can we talk?

05:43.259 --> 05:44.344
I can't right now.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.638
Can't you see that we're busy?

05:46.721 --> 05:49.099
I'm not leaving until we talk.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.440
Annoying.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.444
I saw how you and Bárbara
were looking at each other.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.030
It hurts me that you don't trust me.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.032
Save playing the victim for the stage.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.367
No, no, no, wait.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.955
You're right. Fine.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.333
The trap wasn't an accident.

06:15.959 --> 06:19.754
Well, you should thank Laura, because
she saved you from getting in big trouble.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.339
You're so dramatic, eh?

06:21.423 --> 06:24.509
You should at least apologize to Caterina,
don't you think?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.637
I did what I had to do.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.805
[scoffs]

06:28.888 --> 06:33.184
I wasn't going to let an injury
or some spoiled little rich girl

06:33.268 --> 06:35.228
steal what I've worked so hard for.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.272
You would have done the same in my place.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.151
Greta, it's only a role on opening day.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.653
Only a role?

06:45.363 --> 06:46.614
It's my future.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.326
If you don't understand that, then I don't
understand what we're doing together.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.165
You're right.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.876
We're done.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.103
INTERTWINED

07:20.440 --> 07:21.775
Marco.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.234
Hi.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.779
Is everything okay? You look a little off.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.697
No, no. I'm fine.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.743
I feel… free.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.536
You?

07:33.620 --> 07:37.415
Congratulations. How does it feel
to be an Eleven O'Clock girl?

07:37.499 --> 07:40.752
Everything turned out okay this time.
I think I was able to change history.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.464
How did you know that trap was loose?

07:47.342 --> 07:50.220
Because my eyes are like radars.
So watch out for me.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.306
All right, I'm off.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.599
Where are you going?

07:55.892 --> 07:56.935
To my house.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.853
Where do you live?

08:01.731 --> 08:04.526
Um… over there.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.694
I'll walk you.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.446
No! [laughs]

08:08.530 --> 08:11.700
My eyes are like radars,
but my brain has no sense of direction.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.493
I was confused. My house is over there.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.913
Well, I'll walk you anyway. Let's go.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.877
We've been rehearsing
with Diego and Dante for a while

08:22.961 --> 08:24.879
because we're playing at CD Room
on Thursday.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.007
CD Room?

08:27.632 --> 08:28.883
You don't know it?

08:28.967 --> 08:31.678
Do you live under a rock?
It's at the Galleria.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.763
I didn't know you had a band with Diego.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.849
And Dante. It's called Serotonin.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.519
On Thursday, a record producer
is coming to hear us. You have to come.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.646
I don't think I can.

08:42.605 --> 08:46.359
If you come, you can save me
a slow dance after the show.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.236
And Greta?

08:50.780 --> 08:51.781
We broke up.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.285
Can I ask why?

08:56.661 --> 09:00.165
Greta is a thing of the past.
I want to think about the future now.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.462
You? Where do you see yourself
in 20 years?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.091
The same.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.012
And you?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.474
Touring the world with my band

09:18.391 --> 09:20.685
or alone on a deserted beach
with my guitar

09:21.811 --> 09:24.856
or maybe with a girl from the future
living in the mountains.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.651
You're very clear on what you want.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.529
I have no doubts. Will I see you Thursday?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.282
I have to rehearse.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.453
Okay, I promise I'll try to come.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.499
And I promise that you won't regret it.

09:48.463 --> 09:52.008
[hip-hop music playing]

09:52.092 --> 09:53.093
Diego.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.810
What are you doing, Dante?
This doesn't go in the rock section.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.521
Hey, okay. It's not that big of a deal.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.694
Bárbara. What-- What are you doing here?

10:11.319 --> 10:15.198
I came to see you. CDs. I came to see CDs.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.118
I don't know if I should get Luismi,
Bon Jovi,

10:18.201 --> 10:20.787
or the new Roxette.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.331
-Do you have that one?
-Um…

10:24.833 --> 10:25.834
Here it is.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.714
[clatters]

10:33.133 --> 10:34.175
[chuckles]

10:36.261 --> 10:38.513
Sorry, but Diego was helping me.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.599
Don't worry. I'm not here to shop.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.602
You know what? Dante.

10:44.686 --> 10:48.732
Dante can help you find what
you're looking for much better than I can.

10:50.942 --> 10:54.320
Uh, you know, an interesting fact
about Bon Jovi--

10:54.404 --> 10:57.657
No, thank you.
I'll come back another time.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.454
How did the interview go?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.959
That well? Look at that. Look at that.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.295
Anyway,
I know now that you're going to be famous,

11:10.378 --> 11:12.505
you're not going to want to hang out
with someone like me.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.840
That's okay.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.052
No. I will always have time for my fans.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.970
[both chuckle]

11:19.054 --> 11:20.805
Will I see you on Thursday at CD Room?

11:20.889 --> 11:23.641
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

11:23.725 --> 11:27.479
Excellent, because I have
a surprise for you.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.239
Well, it was a long walk.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.950
This is my house!

11:41.034 --> 11:44.079
All right, thanks. I'll see you.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.794
Is something wrong?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
Uh…

11:55.423 --> 11:59.135
It's just that I forgot my keys. I'm going
to have to wait until my mom gets home.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.512
I can keep you company.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.306
No. No. That's not necessary.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.184
Well, I'm not going to leave a girl
alone on the street.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.020
Oh, Marco, please. That comment
takes us back a thousand years.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.022
You just brought us back
to the 20th century.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.399
This is the 20th century.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.527
You are…

12:16.236 --> 12:18.905
-Please don't say "weird."
-Different.

12:19.531 --> 12:20.657
And is that bad?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.701
It's what I'm looking for.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.205
That's my mom.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.666
Don't let her see you.
You have no idea how she gets with boys.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.349
Excuse me, ma'am. Do you need help?

12:46.433 --> 12:50.770
Oh, yes, dear. Hold this for me
for a minute. I have so many keys.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.982
This always happens.
I can never find the right one.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.694
My son always says, "You don't
have to carry all those keys, Mom."

12:57.777 --> 13:00.655
-I have his, mine…
-Of course.

13:03.742 --> 13:07.328
There it is. It's this one, I think.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.624
There it is. It's this one.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.946
We need to put bells on your bracelet.
Okay?

13:42.030 --> 13:44.074
-[laughs]
-How did it go?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.076
Excellent. My plan worked.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.787
I was afraid you wouldn't be able
to get back.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.830
You're not going to get rid of me
that easily.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.791
I have to talk to Mom.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.085
Um, she just left in a car with Cocó.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.880
My mom and grandma, together?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.006
Yes.

14:01.216 --> 14:06.846
There's no way that Caterina version 2021
voluntarily got into a car with Cocó.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.725
Unless I changed the past.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.519
But…

14:12.602 --> 14:15.522
And if I did, then my mom
was the lead of <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

14:15.605 --> 14:19.067
Since she's a musical theater star now,
she'll sign my permission slip.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.151
No, I still--

14:20.235 --> 14:22.779
She must be at the peak of her career
with Eleven O'Clock!

14:22.862 --> 14:23.905
-What--
-Let's go.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.866
[sighs]

14:26.950 --> 14:31.705
-No! Everything is the same as always.
-That's what I was trying to tell you.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.082
But if my mom is going to be the lead
on opening day,

14:34.165 --> 14:36.960
it's obvious that she'll be Ellie
for the rest of the season.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.837
I thought it was going to work.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.716
Let's see. It's dangerous
to play with time. Oh, I know.

14:42.799 --> 14:48.388
What if winning the lead
didn't change who Caterina is?

14:50.807 --> 14:51.933
That's true.

14:52.017 --> 14:55.895
When we were doing the photo shoot
for the magazine, my mom wasn't happy.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.897
You could tell
she didn't want to be there.

15:01.443 --> 15:05.572
Why-- Why did it just untie?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.907
I don't know. I don't understand, Félix.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.118
Something weird is going to happen
between my mom and Cocó.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.661
Like what?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.419
Like what? Allegra.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.796
[Allegra] I need to find out
what happened between them.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.798
My mom is always writing in her notebooks.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.467
Maybe there's something there.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.721
-Diego?
-What is that?

15:32.891 --> 15:33.892
What did you find?

15:35.894 --> 15:37.354
Diego is Marco's friend.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.523
And they have a band together.
Or they did.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.408
What does it say?

15:50.492 --> 15:54.621
"For Marco. Wherever you are,
your music will always be with me."

15:58.875 --> 16:01.294
If I find out you were covering
for Allegra again--

16:01.378 --> 16:02.671
Who? Me?

16:02.754 --> 16:05.590
Yes, Cocó Sharp,
the professional conspirator.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.676
This time, I had nothing to do with it.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.761
If you want to make things better
with your daughter,

16:09.844 --> 16:12.430
you're going to have to learn
to respect her decisions.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.891
Are you really talking to me
about respecting others' decisions?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.060
[Cocó] That was 20 years ago, Caterina.
Please.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.688
Caterina.
I heard about what happened to you.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.773
-Terrible.
-Is Allegra here?

16:21.856 --> 16:23.608
No. Why?

16:23.692 --> 16:26.736
She left home. I can't find her anywhere.
I'm really worried.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.322
Yes, I'm very worried about her too,

16:29.406 --> 16:31.574
because if she doesn't bring
the signed permission slip,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.827
she won't be able to try out
at the last audition.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.788
She told you that her daughter is missing,
and that's what you say?

16:36.871 --> 16:37.914
Mom, please.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.126
I see that you haven't changed a bit
in all these years.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.670
Thank you. You're exactly the same too.

16:43.753 --> 16:48.133
You always have that… disinterested look.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.343
It's going to be so nice
to see you more often.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.805
You'll be disappointed to know I don't
plan to sign Allegra's permission slip.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.851
Then it seems that the Sharp legacy
has finally come to an end.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.186
I'm going to check the dressing rooms.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.107
Caterina. Hi.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.152
I heard about your accident.
I was going to call. How are you?

17:07.235 --> 17:08.903
I'm fine. Have you seen my daughter?

17:08.987 --> 17:11.781
Yes, I saw her. Impressive.
The audition the other day was--

17:11.865 --> 17:13.867
No. I can't find her anywhere.
She left home.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.828
Well, don't worry. You know how kids are.

17:16.911 --> 17:20.290
Maybe she met up with a friend
and lost track of time.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.459
We were the same way. You remember?

17:22.542 --> 17:26.504
I feel like I've already seen this movie.
And it doesn't have a happy ending.

17:27.881 --> 17:28.965
Excuse me.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.634
I guess this is the saga.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.138
Too bad sequels always suck, huh?

17:37.098 --> 17:39.934
Here. There's an interview
with the play's producer.

17:40.018 --> 17:44.356
He was in charge of the European tour
of <i>Freaky Friday </i>in 1994.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.774
And what does it say?

17:45.857 --> 17:49.319
Let's see.
He has great things to say about Cocó,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.989
the show, Greta…

17:55.116 --> 17:56.284
That's it?

17:57.327 --> 17:58.495
That's it.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.999
No. I have to go. I have to go. I'm late.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.251
I have to go scout locations
for the short.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.588
I haven't finished editing the images
for the projection mapping either.

18:08.672 --> 18:09.798
For what?

18:10.632 --> 18:11.841
Want me to show you?

18:17.138 --> 18:19.516
Give me a second. I'll find it here.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.642
There it is. Look.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.812
The projection creates
an optical illusion.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.605
It's like a 3D effect.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.982
I'm going to use this
in the chase sequence.

18:28.066 --> 18:31.486
The main character runs,
and the spirit follows her.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.865
What do you think?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.451
It looks real. It's scary.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.744
-See?
-Hmm.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.037

18:41.121 --> 18:44.040

-Yes, Mom. I'm okay.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.628
Where were you?

18:48.712 --> 18:49.796
Uh…

18:49.879 --> 18:51.881
She was helping me with the short.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.968
You should have told me.
Why didn't you take your phone?

18:55.760 --> 18:59.305
You chose a very bad time to play
the rebellious teenager, right?

18:59.389 --> 19:01.266
Caterina, I think that you should--

19:01.349 --> 19:05.353
If you're going to contribute something,
it better be helpful.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.355
Mom, I decided to go to the audition.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.149
No, Allegra. I convinced you.

19:09.232 --> 19:12.819
And I'm very happy that I did.
You were amazing.

19:12.902 --> 19:16.322
If I had missed the audition,
I would have to wait for the next one.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.533
No, she didn't tell you to protect you.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.829
If you're so quick to defend her…

19:25.040 --> 19:26.875
why did you send me this?

19:33.089 --> 19:34.924
I didn't send anything.

19:38.762 --> 19:39.804
-Allegra.
-[door closes]

19:44.517 --> 19:45.643
See you later.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.648
[sighs] I think we should all
calm down a bit.

19:51.483 --> 19:52.609
Do you want tea?

19:53.485 --> 19:55.653
No. Weren't you leaving today?

19:55.737 --> 19:57.447
I missed the flight.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.657
I couldn't leave you while
you were looking for your daughter.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.369
My daughter is home now.
You can leave with a clear conscience.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.539

I don't know what happened.

20:19.344 --> 20:22.389
What is it? You don't want me to audition
again so we can film the short?

20:22.472 --> 20:25.517
What? Of course not.
I've always supported you.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.145
And now you regret having helped me,
so you sent that video to my mom.

20:29.229 --> 20:32.190
You can't seriously be doubting me.
I had nothing to do with it.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.650
I would never do anything like that.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.443
Here nothing works out for me,
while in the past--

20:35.527 --> 20:36.986
In the past what?

21:32.542 --> 21:33.668
Is everything okay?

21:34.627 --> 21:35.670
And that bracelet?

21:36.880 --> 21:38.256
It was a gift.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.467
From who?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.260
A friend, a long time ago.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.846
-Where did they buy it?
-I have no idea. Why?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.515
Because it's very pretty, and--

Caterina must be waiting for me,
so I better go find her.

I don't think we can afford to pay
for the repair right now. No.

for that one to work.
