WEBVTT

00:07.990 --> 00:10.258
AHH, SUNDAY.

00:10.326 --> 00:11.626
YOU KNOW WHAT I
LIKE TO CALL IT?

00:11.693 --> 00:13.894
FUN DAY.

00:13.962 --> 00:15.530
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:27.026 --> 00:30.261
OK, I GOT A COUPLE
PROBLEMS HERE,

00:30.329 --> 00:31.562
BUT LET'S START
WITH THIS ONE-

00:31.630 --> 00:34.365
WHY DO YOUR SOCKS
HAVE BIG 4s ON THE BOTTOM?

00:34.433 --> 00:35.900
IT'S MY NEW SYSTEM.

00:35.968 --> 00:37.769
I LABEL THEM SO
I DON'T MIX THEM UP

00:37.836 --> 00:40.037
WITH MY OTHER
SETS OF SOCKS.

00:40.105 --> 00:42.540
BAM!

00:44.160 --> 00:45.693
BUT ARTHUR, ALL YOUR SOCKS
ARE WHITE.

00:45.761 --> 00:47.295
YOU JUST GRAB
ANY TWO OF THEM.

00:47.363 --> 00:50.699
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD OF "TOE MEMORY."

00:50.766 --> 00:54.602
AS A SOCK EVOLVES, IT
EITHER BECOMES A LEFT SOCK

00:54.670 --> 00:56.237
OR A RIGHT SOCK.

00:56.305 --> 00:58.873
IF YOU PUT ONE
ON THE WRONG FOOT,

00:58.941 --> 01:02.443
YOU'RE ASKING FOR
A DAY OF DISCOMFORT,

01:02.511 --> 01:04.378
AND SHAME.

01:06.265 --> 01:08.533
BUT HOW DO THE 4s TELL
YOU WHICH ONE'S A RIGHT

01:08.601 --> 01:10.067
AND WHICH ONE'S A LEFT?

01:10.135 --> 01:12.003
LOOK, DOUGLAS, MY SYSTEM HAS ITS FLAWS,

01:12.071 --> 01:14.306
BUT I'VE COME AT THIS FROM EVERY ANGLE,

01:14.373 --> 01:17.442
AND BELIEVE ME, THERE IS NO BETTER WAY.

01:18.544 --> 01:21.079
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

01:23.916 --> 01:25.484
UNLESS YOU JUST
LABEL EVERY SOCK

01:25.551 --> 01:28.487
WITH EITHER
AN "L" OR AN "R."

01:28.554 --> 01:31.673
WELL, THERE GOES
MY FUN DAY!

01:33.192 --> 01:34.926
BY THE WAY, IT'S SATURDAY.

02:12.197 --> 02:14.165
TODAY I WAS WATCHING
THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL,

02:14.233 --> 02:16.251
AND THEY SAID BECAUSE
OF THAT EVOLUTION CRAP,

02:16.318 --> 02:19.954
THAT EVENTUALLY PEOPLE ARE
GONNA STOP HAVING PINKIE TOES.

02:20.022 --> 02:22.040
OH, MAN. THAT BLOWS.
I KNOW.

02:22.107 --> 02:24.442
YEAH, BUT THAT WON'T HAPPEN
FOR LIKE THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

02:24.509 --> 02:25.710
STILL, THAT DOESN'T
WORRY YOU?

02:25.778 --> 02:28.563
NO. I HAVE
PINKIE TOES.

02:28.631 --> 02:30.081
GREAT, WHY DON'T YOU TELL
THAT TO YOUR GRANDCHILDREN

02:30.149 --> 02:31.316
WHEN THEY'RE
TIPPING OVER?

02:32.684 --> 02:33.818
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

02:33.886 --> 02:34.986
HEY.

02:37.539 --> 02:39.123
WHAT?

02:39.192 --> 02:42.059
YOU, UH, YOU DO REALIZE YOU GOT
A BABY STRAPPED TO YOUR CHEST?

02:42.127 --> 02:43.394
YEAH.

02:43.462 --> 02:45.029
UM, AH, DIP, GOOD.

02:47.065 --> 02:48.867
OK, GUY, WHAT'S
THE DEAL HERE?

02:48.935 --> 02:50.535
IT'S TANYA'S KID.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.303
THAT WAITRESS YOU
USED TO GO OUT WITH?

02:52.371 --> 02:53.905
YOU HAD A KID WITH HER?

02:53.973 --> 02:55.357
NO, REMEMBER,
SHE CHEATED ON ME?

02:55.424 --> 02:57.892
DO YOU GUYS LISTEN
TO ANYTHING I SAY?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.511
SO-SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH HER BABY?

03:00.579 --> 03:02.963
AH, SHE'S GOT SOME TRAINING
SEMINAR OUT OF TOWN FOR THE WEEKEND,

03:03.031 --> 03:04.965
SO SHE ASKED ME
TO WATCH THE KID.

03:05.033 --> 03:06.267
SO SHE'S GOT YOU
BABYSITTING THE KID

03:06.335 --> 03:09.603
SHE HAD WITH THE GUY
SHE CHEATED ON YOU WITH?

03:09.671 --> 03:10.721
YEAH.

03:10.789 --> 03:12.623
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A
PLOY TO GET BACK WITH ME.

03:12.691 --> 03:15.593
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY SHE BORROWED
MY CAR AND ALL THAT MONEY.

03:15.661 --> 03:19.230
OBVIOUSLY GOT A BAD CASE
OF THE DANNYS.

03:19.298 --> 03:21.466
WELL, I GOTTA SAY
THAT'S A PRETTY CUTE KID,

03:21.533 --> 03:24.101
YOU KNOW, FOR A WHITE ONE.

03:24.169 --> 03:26.504
THANKS, MAN. AND
I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG,

03:26.572 --> 03:28.607
BUT THE GUY THAT SHE
CHEATED ON ME WITH,

03:28.674 --> 03:31.075
HE WAS AN
UNDERWEAR MODEL.

03:31.143 --> 03:33.027
HEY, LET ME
CHECK IT OUT.

03:33.095 --> 03:34.445
OH, MAYBE LATER.

03:34.513 --> 03:36.247
YOU KNOW, MY LITTLE GUY
JUST SAID "DADA"

03:36.315 --> 03:37.382
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

03:37.449 --> 03:40.385
HE SAID IT TO THE CABLE GUY,
BUT IT WAS STILL A THRILL.

03:41.587 --> 03:43.254
AH, KIDS ARE GREAT.

03:43.322 --> 03:45.456
YEAH, I'M SO ATTACHED AND
IT'S NOT EVEN MY OWN KID.

03:45.524 --> 03:47.658
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHAT THAT WOULD FEEL LIKE.

03:47.726 --> 03:49.294
I GOTTA TAKE A LEAK.

03:49.361 --> 03:51.212
YEAH, I'LL
TAKE HER.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.280
AH, DEAC'S GOT HER.

03:52.348 --> 03:53.748
YEAH.

03:53.815 --> 03:56.301
GUY, I CAN HOLD
THE BABY, OK?

03:56.368 --> 03:58.068
I HELD HIS KID
AT HIS CHRISTENING.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.302
EXCUSE ME, YOU'RE
THE MANAGER, RIGHT?

04:14.370 --> 04:15.437
YES.

04:15.504 --> 04:16.588
I'M ARTHUR SPOONER.

04:16.654 --> 04:18.589
I'D LIKE TO OFFICIALLY
ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY

04:18.656 --> 04:21.291
FOR "CUSTOMER
OF THE MONTH."

04:21.377 --> 04:25.179
OH, WELL, WE'LL CERTAINLY
KEEP YOU IN MIND.

04:25.214 --> 04:26.680
JUST TO REMIND YOU,

04:26.749 --> 04:28.682
I HAVE BEEN HERE
EVERY DAY THIS MONTH.

04:28.751 --> 04:30.317
MY ATTENDANCE IS PERFECT.

04:30.385 --> 04:32.686
YES, I KNOW YOU
COME IN HERE A LOT.

04:32.755 --> 04:35.022
NOT A LOT. EVERY DAY.

04:35.090 --> 04:38.109
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE
NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN YOU

04:38.176 --> 04:39.911
BUY ANYTHING.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.345
WHAT?

04:41.413 --> 04:43.514
YEAH, YOU BRING A
THERMOS OF YOUR OWN COFFEE

04:43.582 --> 04:45.583
AND USE OUR
CREAM AND SUGAR.

04:45.651 --> 04:46.818
I BUY THINGS
ALL THE TIME.

04:46.886 --> 04:49.854
I PURCHASED A RICE KRISPIE
TREAT NOT 2 WEEKS AGO.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.290
YES, BUT YOU ATE
MOST OF IT

04:52.358 --> 04:54.058
AND RETURNED THE REST
FOR A REFUND.

04:54.126 --> 04:56.027
YOU SAID YOU FOUND
A FISH HOOK IN IT.

04:56.094 --> 04:58.513
I DID.

04:58.580 --> 05:03.217
UM, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
HOW MUCH MONEY PEOPLE SPEND.

05:03.285 --> 05:05.586
LOOK AT HELEN.
SHE'S 80 YEARS OLD

05:05.654 --> 05:08.055
AND JUST WALKED 12 MILES
FOR MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY.

05:08.123 --> 05:10.925
OH, I SEE. SO I CAN'T BE
CUSTOMER OF THE MONTH

05:10.993 --> 05:13.260
BECAUSE I HAD A FALLING
OUT WITH JERRY LEWIS?

05:13.328 --> 05:14.262
SIR, YOU'RE MISSING-

05:14.413 --> 05:16.614
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I PUT A CALL INTO HIM,

05:16.682 --> 05:18.516
THE BALL IS
IN HIS COURT.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.051
LOOK, I GOTTA
GET BACK TO WORK.

05:20.118 --> 05:22.486
OH, BY THE WAY,

05:22.555 --> 05:24.889
I THINK YOUR RAZOR'S
FINISHED CHARGING.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.751
HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:52.818 --> 05:55.253
SHH! DON'T BE AFRAID.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.756
JUST RELAX.

05:57.823 --> 06:00.491
I GOTTA GET UP EARLY
FOR WORK TOMORROW.

06:00.559 --> 06:01.726
SHH, COME ON.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.428
LET'S MAKE A BABY.

06:04.496 --> 06:06.697
WHAT?

06:06.765 --> 06:09.968
YEAH. I WANT TO MAKE
A BABY. TONIGHT.

06:10.035 --> 06:12.202
WERE YOU AT A STRIP CLUB?

06:12.270 --> 06:14.355
NO, I JUST...

06:14.422 --> 06:16.090
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

06:16.158 --> 06:18.159
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU

06:18.226 --> 06:22.931
AND HOW MUCH A BABY WOULD
MAKE OUR LIVES COMPLETE.

06:22.998 --> 06:24.282
REALLY?

06:24.349 --> 06:27.018
YEAH. SO SCOOCH YOUR
BLOOMERS DOWN AND COUNT TO 50.

06:27.085 --> 06:28.252
COME ON.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.855
ARE YOU SERIOUS? I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU LIKE THIS.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.725
YEAH. OH, AND BY THE WAY,
WHEN WE HAVE OUR BABY,

06:33.793 --> 06:35.259
DANNY'S NOT ALLOWED
TO HOLD IT.

06:35.327 --> 06:36.694
HA HA, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:36.762 --> 06:37.829
IT'S JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW,

06:37.897 --> 06:38.930
HE WAS BABYSITTING
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S KID,

06:38.998 --> 06:40.498
AND HE WOULDN'T
LET ME HOLD IT,

06:40.565 --> 06:42.333
BUT THE JOKE'S ON HIM BECAUSE
WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUR OWN BABY

06:42.401 --> 06:44.202
AND IT'S GONNA BLOW
HIS AWAY, SO COME ON.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.236
ALL RIGHT, GET OFF ME.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.538
WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

06:47.606 --> 06:48.739
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

06:48.807 --> 06:49.773
THE REASON WHY
YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY

06:49.841 --> 06:51.809
IS SO YOU CAN GET EVEN
WITH DANNY?

06:51.876 --> 06:53.595
AND MAKE OUR LIVES
COMPLETE!

06:53.662 --> 06:55.946
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE, MAN!

06:56.014 --> 06:57.881
THIS IS WHY I DON'T
WANT TO HAVE A BABY,

06:57.949 --> 07:01.001
BECAUSE YOU ARE
SO IRRESPONSIBLE!

07:01.069 --> 07:02.119
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY, LET'S
FORGET THE WHOLE DANNY THING.

07:02.187 --> 07:04.489
SERIOUSLY, THE POINT IS,
I WANT TO START A FAMILY.

07:04.557 --> 07:05.573
WELL, GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT,

07:05.641 --> 07:07.391
BECAUSE THIS
KITCHEN'S CLOSED.

07:07.459 --> 07:08.993
WAIT A SECOND NOW! COME
ON, THERE'S TWO OF US HERE.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.628
OK? YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE
ALL OF THE DECISIONS.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.698
UH, THINK I CAN,
THINK I DID.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.133
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF YOU

07:16.201 --> 07:17.936
ACTING LIKE YOU'RE
THE BOSS AROUND HERE.

07:18.003 --> 07:19.303
"NO, DOUG, YOU CAN'T
GET THAT CAR.

07:19.371 --> 07:21.840
NO, DOUG, YOU CAN'T
DO STEROIDS."

07:21.907 --> 07:25.777
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS CONVERSATION'S
OVER. I'M GOING TO SLEEP.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.077
OK, JUST SO
I'M CLEAR ON THIS,

07:27.145 --> 07:30.080
YOU'RE DECIDING
NO BABY, SO, NO BABY.

07:30.148 --> 07:31.732
YEP.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.868
OH, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.031
HEY.
HEY.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.733
I NEED TO BORROW
YOUR BABY.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.401
WHAT? NO.

07:50.468 --> 07:52.220
JUST FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

07:52.288 --> 07:53.354
GUY, IT'S A BABY,

07:53.422 --> 07:54.622
NOT A
WEED-WHACKER.

07:54.790 --> 07:57.108
LOOK, I GOT INTO THIS WHOLE
THING WITH CARRIE AND...

07:57.175 --> 07:58.743
LOOK, I GOTTA SHOW HER
WHO'S BOSS OF THE HOUSE.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.862
I- I CAN'T. I-I
PROMISED TONYA

08:00.929 --> 08:02.230
THAT I WOULDN'T TAKE
MY EYE OFF THE BABY.

08:02.297 --> 08:03.931
AND WHEN SOMEONE PUTS THEIR
FAITH IN YOU LIKE THAT,

08:03.999 --> 08:06.200
YOU KNOW,
IT MEANS SOMETHING.

08:06.268 --> 08:09.971
<i>ALTHOUGH, I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE TRANSPORTER TWO.</i>

08:16.845 --> 08:18.413
ALL RIGHT, THERE
SHE IS. YOU READY?

08:18.480 --> 08:20.381
I WAS BORN READY.

08:23.185 --> 08:25.419
OH, MY GOD!
HE'S CHOKING!

08:26.655 --> 08:29.273
UHH! UHH! UHH!

08:30.976 --> 08:33.544
THERE WAS A FISHHOOK
IN MY SCONE.

08:35.647 --> 08:36.429
That man saved my life.

08:36.582 --> 08:40.967
OH, YEAH. THAT MAN SAVED MY LIFE.

08:41.035 --> 08:42.203
SETTLE DOWN, EVERYONE.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.738
JUST DOING WHAT
ANY CUSTOMER WOULD DO.

08:44.807 --> 08:46.107
ANY CUSTOMER?

08:46.175 --> 08:49.576
HE SHOULD BE
CUSTOMER OF THE MONTH!

08:49.644 --> 08:50.995
We done?

08:52.932 --> 08:55.049
SHALL WE TAKE
MY PICTURE NOW?

08:55.116 --> 08:58.419
I'M PACKED IN A GIRDLE
SO LET'S GET THIS DONE.

08:58.487 --> 09:00.237
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU

09:00.305 --> 09:01.472
CUSTOMER
OF THE MONTH

09:01.540 --> 09:04.475
BECAUSE OF THAT RIDICULOUS
STUNT YOU JUST PULLED?

09:04.543 --> 09:07.728
UNLESS YOU WANT A RIOT
ON YOUR HANDS?

09:11.933 --> 09:14.785
LISTEN, OLD MAN,
AND LISTEN GOOD.

09:14.853 --> 09:16.020
AS LONG AS
I'M MANAGER,

09:16.088 --> 09:19.356
YOU WILL NEVER, EVER BE
CUSTOMER OF THE MONTH.

09:19.424 --> 09:21.525
HAVE A NICE DAY.

09:21.593 --> 09:23.544
HMM...

09:28.934 --> 09:30.100
I'M HOME!

09:30.168 --> 09:31.752
HEY.
OH.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.688
LISTEN, HONEY, I'M SORRY I
CAME DOWN ON YOU LAST NIGHT.

09:34.756 --> 09:35.740
IT'S JUST
THAT SOMETIMES

09:35.807 --> 09:37.558
I GOTTA DO WHAT'S BEST FOR US, YOU KNOW?

09:37.626 --> 09:39.593
I KNOW. I KNOW
AND THANKS.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.896
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

09:51.957 --> 09:53.190
EXCUSE ME.

09:54.459 --> 09:57.211
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

09:57.279 --> 09:59.830
DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD
STOP ME FROM HAVING A BABY?

09:59.898 --> 10:02.333
YOU'RE MY BABY.
YES, YOU ARE.

10:02.401 --> 10:04.285
ALL RIGHT, IF I
TURN THE TV ON RIGHT NOW,

10:04.353 --> 10:06.520
WILL YOUR PICTURE
BE ON THE NEWS?

10:06.588 --> 10:07.688
NO.

10:07.756 --> 10:09.090
NO, IT WON'T.
NO, IT WILL NOT.

10:09.157 --> 10:10.091
COME HERE.

10:10.158 --> 10:11.825
ALL RIGHT, WOULD
YOU STOP DOING THAT?

10:11.894 --> 10:13.094
STOP WHAT?

10:13.161 --> 10:14.461
ALL RIGHT, DOUG,
I GET IT.

10:14.529 --> 10:16.563
YOU'RE VERY CLEVER. YOU
BORROWED SOMEBODY'S BABY.

10:16.631 --> 10:19.600
DID YOU ACTUALLY THINK THIS WAS
GONNA MAKE ME WANT TO HAVE A BABY?

10:19.667 --> 10:20.868
I DON'T CARE.
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.

10:20.936 --> 10:22.270
OK, I'VE MOVED ON.

10:22.337 --> 10:23.804
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN YOU DO STUPID THINGS

10:23.872 --> 10:25.773
LIKE THIS, IT PUSHES
ME FURTHER AWAY

10:25.840 --> 10:27.241
FROM EVER WANTING
TO HAVE A BABY...

10:27.309 --> 10:28.542
WITH YOU, THAT IS.

10:28.610 --> 10:29.910
OK, IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

10:29.978 --> 10:31.512
DON'T NEED YOU

11:10.802 --> 11:13.137
UH, PARENTHOOD
ISN'T A THING.

11:13.205 --> 11:14.605
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.

11:14.672 --> 11:16.107
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG,

11:16.174 --> 11:19.009
IT STARTED OUT STUPID BUT NOW

<i>OH, MAN, YOU GOTTA

11:45.220 --> 11:46.404
CARRIE'S COPPING

11:46.472 --> 11:47.572
AND IF I LET HER WIN

11:47.639 --> 11:49.340
HOW 'BOUT I GO

11:50.708 --> 11:52.009
THAT WAS EASY.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.250
IT'S COMING.

12:22.891 --> 12:26.794
<i>IS MY LITTLE GIRL

12:26.862 --> 12:28.895
FIRST, I TEST
IT ON THE WRIST

12:28.963 --> 12:30.614
TO MAKE SURE IT'S
THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE.

12:30.682 --> 12:33.417
SH-UGH!

12:33.485 --> 12:35.202
I'M GUESSING IT'S NOT?

12:35.270 --> 12:36.821

12:36.888 --> 12:39.423
8 MINUTES IN THE MICRO,
TOO LONG.

12:40.425 --> 12:41.708
UH, YOUR BABY'S CRYING.

12:41.776 --> 12:44.645
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WHIP UP
SOME FLAMING APPLESAUCE.

12:44.713 --> 12:48.449
HER PAPA WILL DECIDE
WHAT SHE WANTS TO EAT, OK?

13:17.729 --> 13:21.265
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

13:21.333 --> 13:25.736

13:28.940 --> 13:31.892
OK, SHE WON'T STOP CRYING.
I CAN'T PUT HER TO SLEEP.

HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

13:57.869 --> 14:00.554
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU GOT

14:00.622 --> 14:03.390
PILLS, DROPS-
LEGAL, ILLEGAL.

14:03.458 --> 14:04.792
I GOT CASH.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.143
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

14:06.211 --> 14:08.079
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONE
TO GO THROUGH THIS.

14:08.146 --> 14:09.313
YEAH, IT DOESN'T.

14:09.380 --> 14:10.414
HOW ABOUT PILLS FOR ME?

14:10.481 --> 14:12.349
'CAUSE I'M AT THE
END OF MY ROPE.

14:12.417 --> 14:13.517
SINGLE PARENT, HUH?

14:13.585 --> 14:15.168

14:20.125 --> 14:22.159
UH, AND BY "HELP"
DO YOU MEAN

14:22.227 --> 14:24.261

14:29.784 --> 14:32.202
HI, WELCOME. COME SIT.

14:32.270 --> 14:33.721
THE FLOOR'S OPEN.
SO, IF YOU HAVE

14:33.789 --> 14:36.173
ANY QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS,
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.774
WELL, MY BABY HASN'T
BEEN SLEEPING,

14:37.842 --> 14:41.378
AND I'VE BEEN
CRYING A LOT.

14:41.446 --> 14:43.147
DID YOU TRY
THE DRYER THING?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.432
YOU PUT 'EM
IN THE DRYER?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.234
NO, NO. YOU PUT THE BABY IN A
CAR SEAT ON TOP OF THE DRYER.

14:47.302 --> 14:48.703
PUTS THEM RIGHT OUT.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.437
AND LET ME ASK YOU.
WHAT ABOUT FOOD?

14:50.505 --> 14:53.840
'CAUSE MY BABY HASN'T
BEEN EATING HER VEGETABLES.

14:53.908 --> 14:55.826
OH, WELL, YOU GOT TO KEEP
THEM AWAY FROM FRUIT.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.495
BECAUSE ONCE THEY TASTE
THE SWEET STUFF,

14:57.562 --> 14:59.430
THEY ARE NOT GOING BACK.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.549

THAT BABY IS RIGHT IN HERE.

16:04.162 --> 16:06.029
LADIES, YOU DON'T WANT
TO PUT YOUR BABIES TO BED

16:06.097 --> 16:07.665
ON THE SAME SIDE
EVERY NIGHT.

16:07.732 --> 16:11.835
THAT'S HOW YOU GET FLATHEAD
McGEE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

16:11.903 --> 16:13.087

16:13.155 --> 16:14.722
I'M KIDDING.

16:17.475 --> 16:18.859
I'LL TELL YOU
MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.728
SINCE I HAD THE BABY,
I CAN'T REMEMBER

16:20.796 --> 16:22.696
THE LAST TIME MY HUSBAND
AND I HAD SEX.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.449
SEX? THAT'S WHAT GOT US INTO
THIS WHOLE MESS. AM I RIGHT?

16:27.151 --> 16:28.368
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO HERE.

16:28.436 --> 16:30.153
JERRY JUST WON'T LATCH ON.

16:30.221 --> 16:32.055
HAVE YOU TRIED
THE FOOTBALL HOLD?

16:32.123 --> 16:33.891

THE FOOTBALL HOLD?

16:33.958 --> 16:34.958

16:35.026 --> 16:36.026
OK.

16:36.094 --> 16:37.895
YOU GOT TO HOLD HIM
LIKE A FOOTBALL.

16:37.962 --> 16:39.497
THAT'S BASICALLY
WHAT YOU DO.

16:39.564 --> 16:40.731
YOU JUST HOLD HIM THERE,

16:40.799 --> 16:43.567
AND YOU LET HIM LAND
IN BOOBYVILLE.

16:43.635 --> 16:44.701
LET HIM FIND IT.

16:44.769 --> 16:47.371
THERE HE GOES. WHOA. HIS
BOTTOM TEETH ARE COMING IN.
