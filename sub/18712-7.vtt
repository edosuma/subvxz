00:14.167 --> 00:16.927
You look tired.

00:16.967 --> 00:19.247
I've had better days.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.287
The perils of a double life.

00:27.407 --> 00:29.407
Updated estimates.

00:29.447 --> 00:32.447
Sorry, they'll need to be added to
tomorrow's charts.

00:32.487 --> 00:34.487
Wonderful.

00:34.527 --> 00:36.527
Don't work too late.

00:42.887 --> 00:44.887
Transatlantic convoys...

00:45.967 --> 00:47.967
departure dates.

00:50.007 --> 00:52.056
There doesn't seem to be anything
for arrivals.

00:52.081 --> 00:53.932
Well he's a cocktail waiter.

00:55.367 --> 00:56.804
He can only do so much.

00:56.829 --> 00:59.039
Then perhaps you need to
move up the food chain.

00:59.087 --> 01:01.767
No, he's still useful. You'll get
what you want.

01:03.007 --> 01:05.527
I trust my efforts will be reflected
in my fee.

01:07.207 --> 01:09.836
You're not a man complicated by
ideology, Mr. D'Aberville.

01:11.111 --> 01:14.207
I like that about you. Fill in the
blanks...

01:14.247 --> 01:16.247
and then we'll talk.

01:27.047 --> 01:30.127
I know I have to go back to work,

01:30.167 --> 01:32.167
but you should be resting.

01:32.207 --> 01:35.767
I'm supposed to be presenting to his
aide-de-camp tomorrow morning.

01:35.807 --> 01:39.567
So I doubt even a direct hit would
cut it as an excuse.

01:39.607 --> 01:41.607
I'll have some coffee sent up then.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.167
Come.

01:50.607 --> 01:53.087
I'm starting to think I might be
quite lucky.

03:34.687 --> 03:37.167
- It's quite beautiful.
- I'm glad you like it.

03:37.207 --> 03:39.007
I should have consulted you.

03:39.047 --> 03:42.287
Why? Well, I'd like you to take over
the organisation

03:42.327 --> 03:44.927
of the hotel's anniversary
celebrations.

03:44.967 --> 03:47.727
It's a big event, the biggest we've
ever had,

03:47.767 --> 03:50.487
- but I think you're ready for it.
- Yes, absolutely.

03:50.527 --> 03:53.447
- Ooh, it's chilly out there.
- Good evening, Mr. D'Aberville.

03:53.487 --> 03:55.225
Her Ladyship's waiting for you in
the bar.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.250
Excellent.

04:02.847 --> 04:04.847
You have something for me, Mr. Joshi?

04:07.487 --> 04:09.327
I obtained the rest of those
figures.

04:09.367 --> 04:12.070
- Well I think that calls for champagne.
- I'm finished with this.

04:12.094 --> 04:12.992
No, you're not.

04:13.015 --> 04:15.727
And please remember I like my service
with a smile.

04:17.087 --> 04:18.687
Smile.

04:26.047 --> 04:27.927
Thank you.

04:30.767 --> 04:33.367
Bloody things.

04:35.887 --> 04:38.447
Just like Cinderella.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.407
Hardly.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.607
And sorry, staff only back here.
They're big on the rules.

04:44.647 --> 04:47.847
Come out front then. Have a drink.

04:47.887 --> 04:50.487
No, I'm fine, thank you. Please.

04:50.527 --> 04:52.407
I insist.

04:52.447 --> 04:54.607
The lady said she's fine.

04:56.727 --> 04:58.447
Of course.

04:58.487 --> 05:01.047
- No offence intended.
- And none taken.

05:01.087 --> 05:03.087
Enjoy your evening.

05:13.967 --> 05:15.967
"The lady says she's fine."

05:26.207 --> 05:28.287
I've packed your sandwiches.

05:28.327 --> 05:31.247
We'll speak on the phone every day,

05:31.287 --> 05:34.609
sometimes twice. I didn't know Dora
was being evacuated.

05:36.647 --> 05:39.287
Peggy feels it isn't safe here any
more,

05:41.207 --> 05:44.007
especially after Billy.

05:44.047 --> 05:46.047
You have to be a big girl.

05:46.087 --> 05:48.767
For me. Look at me.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.807
And for Billy.

05:57.127 --> 05:59.127
Come on now.

06:00.207 --> 06:02.447
Wave bye-bye.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.087
Bye-bye.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.327
Nah, she doesn't want me sticking my
nose in.

06:13.367 --> 06:15.367
Mr. Feldman.

06:15.407 --> 06:17.407
No, you... you do it...

06:27.407 --> 06:29.407
It's Chertsey.

06:29.447 --> 06:32.367
That's not so far.

06:32.407 --> 06:34.407
Seems a long way to me.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.247
They said it couldn't be done, but
he proved them wrong.

06:44.287 --> 06:48.007
The first US president to be elected
to a third term.

06:50.087 --> 06:54.687
And yet here in London there is
still little cause for celebration...

06:54.727 --> 06:56.367
as Roosevelt vows...

06:57.927 --> 07:02.887
not to send any American boys into
foreign wars.

07:02.927 --> 07:05.407
I asked one hard-working English
woman

07:05.447 --> 07:08.167
what she thought of the President and
she said...

07:09.727 --> 07:13.087
Erm, he seems like a nice man?

07:13.127 --> 07:14.807
She said...

07:16.127 --> 07:21.007
that she hoped the President could hear her
prayers from all the way across the water.

07:22.007 --> 07:23.887
It's called artistic licence.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.767
It's called making things up.

07:25.807 --> 07:28.887
How can I help you,
Miss. Garland?

07:28.927 --> 07:32.767
Well, I've been put in charge of the
Halcyon's Golden Anniversary party

07:32.807 --> 07:36.927
and I wanted to run my ideas past someone
before I present them to Lady Hamilton.

07:36.967 --> 07:39.327
And as I work in the entertainment
industry...

07:39.367 --> 07:43.847
Well, as you spend most of your time
in bars but... that works too.

07:43.887 --> 07:46.607
I'd ask you to discuss it over dinner
and drinks

07:46.647 --> 07:48.715
but I know what your answer to that
one will be.

07:48.740 --> 07:49.740
Yes.

07:50.527 --> 07:54.567
Yes? It would have to be tonight
though as I'm volunteering tomorrow.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.607
But you're saying yes.

07:56.647 --> 08:00.264
Was that wrong of me? Should I have said
no? I can always change my answer.

08:00.289 --> 08:01.289
No.

08:02.127 --> 08:04.127
Yes is good.

08:05.847 --> 08:07.847
We can work with yes.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.687
Good morning.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.727
How may I help you?

08:49.487 --> 08:51.967
Maybe they're going to give you a
promotion?

08:52.007 --> 08:53.967
I'm just presenting
facts and figures.

08:54.007 --> 08:56.927
Doesn't mean they can't promote you
at the same time.

08:56.967 --> 09:00.687
Toby, I think what your mother is trying
to tell you in her own unique way

09:00.727 --> 09:03.767
is that she's proud of you. We both
are.

09:03.807 --> 09:07.687
If they do promote you, you can get
yourself a decent suit.

09:07.727 --> 09:10.327
I apologise for the interruption,
Lady Hamilton.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.167
This gentleman would like a word
with Mr. Hamilton.

09:13.207 --> 09:15.207
Hello.

09:16.607 --> 09:18.887
- How can I help you?
- Not here.

09:20.767 --> 09:23.047
Right, OK, let me just...

09:27.447 --> 09:30.727
- Mr. Garland, who are these men?
- Mr. Mortimer is from MI5.

09:30.767 --> 09:34.207
He has a warrant from Special Branch
to have Toby's room searched.

09:34.247 --> 09:37.047
And you let him in here? It's
unacceptable!

09:37.087 --> 09:38.758
Has something happened
to my brother?

09:38.783 --> 09:41.751
It's not about your brother,
Mr. Hamilton, just you.

09:41.785 --> 09:42.363
Wait!

09:42.387 --> 09:44.807
They have a warrant, there's
nothing we can do.

09:44.847 --> 09:48.127
- What are they looking for?
- I'll make some telephone calls.

09:55.327 --> 09:57.647
Good God, what are you doing?!

09:59.887 --> 10:02.767
- That belongs to my son. You have no right.
- Priscilla,

10:02.792 --> 10:05.317
you need to contact Freddie. Go and
telephone your son.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.254
They must stop...

10:06.308 --> 10:08.727
No, no, no, no. I'll see what I can
find out.

10:13.287 --> 10:16.567
I appreciate it's difficult but if
you do hear anything...

10:18.127 --> 10:20.127
Mortimer, yes.

10:22.527 --> 10:24.047
Thank you.

10:24.087 --> 10:27.647
Beauty. I want her. I see.

10:32.687 --> 10:34.687
You're the band leader, aren't you?

10:35.767 --> 10:39.647
Sorry to ask, it's just um, you boys
all look a little alike to me.

10:39.687 --> 10:41.687
If you say so.

10:42.967 --> 10:48.047
Tell me, what's the situation between
you and that delightful young singer?

10:48.087 --> 10:50.087
We're friends.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.247
You seemed a little more than
friends.

10:52.287 --> 10:55.367
With all due respect, that is our
business and no-one else's.

10:55.407 --> 10:59.607
With all due respect, we let you
come here, to England,

10:59.647 --> 11:02.047
and you're pawing away at our women.

11:02.087 --> 11:04.487
There's no respect there at all, is
there?

11:04.527 --> 11:06.807
If you'll excuse me, I need to get to
work.

11:08.127 --> 11:12.727
My God, they put a suit on an ape
and it thinks it's better than us.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.687
I'm talking to you, Sambo. Don't
turn your back on me.

11:17.727 --> 11:19.487
Argh!

11:34.029 --> 11:35.960
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

11:36.036 --> 11:37.818
Did you tell Toby?
Did you tell anyone?

11:37.841 --> 11:38.482
No, I swear.

11:38.489 --> 11:42.407
If you ruin this for me, I will
destroy you. Do you understand?

11:42.447 --> 11:44.447
Do you understand?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.647
Good.

11:48.687 --> 11:50.687
Good boy.

11:53.967 --> 11:58.207
You know, they once tried to shut
down the coffeehouses in London.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.447
Long time ago.

12:03.487 --> 12:06.647
It was the 17th century. Charles II.

12:06.687 --> 12:09.447
An educated man.

12:09.487 --> 12:12.167
Then I suppose you know why they
wanted to close them.

12:12.207 --> 12:15.567
They were seen as... gathering places

12:15.607 --> 12:18.847
for potentially subversive activity.

12:18.887 --> 12:23.247
"Potentially subversive activity."

12:23.287 --> 12:25.287
Very well put.

12:28.127 --> 12:31.247
I don't understand.
What is it that you think I've done?

12:31.287 --> 12:34.287
We've discovered some information has
been leaked from the Admiralty,

12:34.327 --> 12:37.727
information that could only have
come from your department.

12:37.767 --> 12:42.807
It could have led to the destruction of
many of our key ships in the Atlantic.

12:42.847 --> 12:44.847
What? No, that's...

12:48.647 --> 12:51.389
Surely you don't think I had
anything to do with it?

12:51.414 --> 12:52.522
It's a small department.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.967
Were you close to your father?

12:56.990 --> 12:57.693
No.

12:57.779 --> 12:59.887
You understand why I'm asking
you that though...

13:00.967 --> 13:03.107
given his Nazi sympathies.

13:03.132 --> 13:04.132
Yes.

13:13.647 --> 13:15.647
Five people in your department

13:15.687 --> 13:18.887
and one of them has leaked the
information.

13:18.927 --> 13:21.407
So, take a few minutes.

13:21.447 --> 13:23.447
Think hard on who that might be.

13:39.238 --> 13:41.980
It's called The Dorsia.
You've never been?

13:42.011 --> 13:42.956
Well, I've heard of it.

13:43.003 --> 13:47.558
You'll love it. It's good food,
good wine, good company.

13:47.598 --> 13:50.341
I am starting to regret saying yes.

13:54.341 --> 13:55.105
Freddie.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.598
- Do you know where they've taken him?
- Taken who?

13:57.623 --> 14:01.067
Lord Hamilton. I have some
information.

14:01.092 --> 14:03.958
- Mr. O'Hara?
- Of course.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.153
My contact told me...

14:08.184 --> 14:12.118
So as far as we know they've taken him to the
interrogation centre at Latchmere House.

14:12.158 --> 14:14.958
- Well, go down there and get him out.
- It's not that simple.

14:14.998 --> 14:18.228
Freddie, you're Lord Hamilton.
The name carries some weight.

14:18.252 --> 14:22.732
If I may offer a note of caution...
forcing his release won't exonerate him.

14:22.772 --> 14:25.732
With all due respect, Mr. Garland,
it's a family matter.

14:25.772 --> 14:28.332
What it is is an insult.

14:28.354 --> 14:29.182
I need a drink.

14:29.213 --> 14:32.052
What happens to Toby
then? We make them release him,

14:32.091 --> 14:34.470
He'll always have this cloud of
suspicion hanging over him.

14:34.495 --> 14:35.994
He'd be effectively ruined.

14:36.291 --> 14:39.251
He's your brother. They dragged him
out like a common criminal.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.651
He won't be the only one they're
questioning.

14:42.691 --> 14:47.131
We know he's innocent. Let them do their
job and they'll reach the same conclusion.

14:47.171 --> 14:51.331
I'll give you the number for my contact at
Special Branch. He can keep you updated.

14:51.371 --> 14:54.971
I think that's too risky. They might
just be looking for a scapegoat.

14:55.011 --> 14:58.131
The advice is appreciated but my
decision has been made.

14:58.171 --> 15:00.731
At least your father had some
backbone!

15:09.171 --> 15:11.171
Do you recognise these?

15:11.211 --> 15:14.491
Documents about troop movements
found in your briefcase.

15:14.531 --> 15:16.331
In your hotel room.

15:16.371 --> 15:19.257
We have a lot to get through,
some people take work home.

15:19.281 --> 15:20.453
Isn't that against the rules?

15:20.491 --> 15:23.171
Officially yes, but it's understood
if we're up against it...

15:23.211 --> 15:26.331
- You're giving me excuses, Toby.
- No-one else sees them.

15:26.371 --> 15:28.651
When I'm not in my room, they're
locked away.

15:28.691 --> 15:32.451
- I'm the only one with a briefcase key.
- And yet someone in your department's

15:32.491 --> 15:36.451
- leaking information just like this.
- I love this job!

15:36.491 --> 15:39.091
It means the world to me! You
actually have no idea...

15:41.091 --> 15:43.051
Go on.

15:43.091 --> 15:45.771
Shout at me again, Toby. Raise your
voice. Go on.

15:48.131 --> 15:52.011
I am not some snivelling
manservant of yours.

15:53.251 --> 15:56.971
Someone is leaking information to
Germany.

15:59.051 --> 16:01.131
I don't think you realise

16:01.171 --> 16:04.211
just how much trouble these papers
put you in.

16:10.411 --> 16:13.251
That is concerning.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.611
I'm sure it's all just a
misunderstanding.

16:17.691 --> 16:19.811
- I appreciate the effort.
- I'll take it.

16:19.851 --> 16:22.531
Thank you, Mr. Joshi,
that will be all.

16:22.571 --> 16:24.171
Thank you.

16:33.531 --> 16:35.419
Mr. O'Hara, this is
a private residence.

16:35.490 --> 16:36.483
Well the door was open.

16:36.513 --> 16:39.011
Well, you can
close it on your way out, please.

16:40.251 --> 16:43.851
Toby got pinched over leaks from his
Admiralty department, right?

16:43.891 --> 16:46.571
- How do you know that.
- I got a tipoff.

16:46.611 --> 16:49.931
And if I'm getting one it means others
are too. I'm not that popular.

16:49.971 --> 16:52.851
- And you want to do a story on it?
- No, just wanted to see

16:52.891 --> 16:56.051
if there's anything I can do to help
before this all blows up.

16:56.091 --> 16:57.851
Toby's a friend.

17:02.131 --> 17:04.131
You can trust Mr. O'Hara, Freddie.

17:10.090 --> 17:12.731
It turns out it's not as simple as
we thought.

17:13.971 --> 17:17.131
I've just learnt they found
confidential papers in his room.

17:17.179 --> 17:18.255
You don't think he was...

17:18.280 --> 17:21.651
No, he'd have brought them
home to work on.

17:21.691 --> 17:25.531
But they can call it evidence.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.570
And that changes everything.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.891
Have you been compromised? As far as
I can tell, no.

17:33.331 --> 17:36.571
- This is not good, Mr. D'Aberville.
- The fault does not lie at my end.

17:36.611 --> 17:38.229
It must be your people who
were caught out.

17:38.253 --> 17:40.369
- Careful.
- I was careful.

17:41.251 --> 17:44.131
And now I need to plan my exit route.

17:44.171 --> 17:46.171
Documents for safe passage.

17:46.211 --> 17:49.611
Don't be foolish. If you flee now,
you expose the whole thing.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.131
There are ways to leave quietly.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.171
Not without money.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.931
What is it you want me to do?

18:00.971 --> 18:03.931
While the Americans won't want to
get physically involved,

18:03.971 --> 18:08.451
we believe Roosevelt may send
armaments across the Atlantic as aid.

18:08.491 --> 18:10.092
This is well beyond what we agreed.

18:10.116 --> 18:13.475
Information like that would be
worth a lot, Mr. D'Aberville,

18:13.531 --> 18:16.931
enough to help a man disappear,
whatever his circumstances.

18:20.131 --> 18:23.371
There are good ways to leave... or
there are bad.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.571
The choice is yours.

18:37.227 --> 18:39.491
Mr. Garland.

18:40.407 --> 18:43.731
I have a very serious complaint
about one of your staff.

18:49.183 --> 18:51.776
It doesn't matter that you think
he's innocent.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.621
Of course that matters.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.291
Nobody cares what you think.

18:56.331 --> 18:59.697
Well that's good because I think this
conversation is a waste of time.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.214
Just... hear me out.

19:02.571 --> 19:05.851
Whoever you speak to will want to
know why they should care.

19:05.891 --> 19:08.891
It's a rule of broadcasting. You
personalise it.

19:08.931 --> 19:11.731
Here's why Toby's arrest
is bad for you.

19:11.771 --> 19:14.371
And it would be bad for them
because...?

19:14.411 --> 19:18.051
Yeah, I said I wanted to help. I
didn't say I had all the answers.

19:22.866 --> 19:23.804
Freddie?

19:23.842 --> 19:26.731
We're talking about
interfering in state security.

19:26.771 --> 19:29.731
I get that, but your
country's at war.

19:29.771 --> 19:32.291
Justice and due process don't
always win out.

19:32.331 --> 19:35.691
And history is full of men who swung
at the end of a rope

19:35.731 --> 19:37.731
for something they didn't do.

19:47.531 --> 19:49.531
Mr. Sullivan.

19:52.331 --> 19:54.331
Do you know why I'm here?

19:56.691 --> 19:59.531
Mr. Wilson claims he and his friends
were talking to you

19:59.571 --> 20:02.331
and you took offence
at an innocent remark.

20:02.371 --> 20:05.051
- He says you struck him.
- That's not what happened.

20:05.091 --> 20:09.691
- You didn't raise your hand to him?
- Only to push him away when he grabbed me.

20:09.731 --> 20:11.731
He wants you dismissed.

20:13.741 --> 20:15.891
Now I'm of the opinion that a...

20:16.891 --> 20:20.771
humble and sincere apology will
placate him.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.331
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

20:28.331 --> 20:32.771
He's returning this evening to have a
few drinks and watch tonight's show.

20:32.811 --> 20:35.891
I suggest you strongly reconsider
your stance on this.

20:41.458 --> 20:46.011
Try to put everything back in its
place... as best you can.

20:47.131 --> 20:49.131
Is his Lordship going to get him out?

20:51.411 --> 20:53.411
Just clean the room.

21:06.019 --> 21:08.611
Lord Hamilton.

21:08.651 --> 21:12.251
Who would I speak to about having
Toby released?

21:12.276 --> 21:14.065
I strongly advise against it.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.211
I appreciate that,
but my mind is made up.

21:19.451 --> 21:21.971
There is someone,

21:22.011 --> 21:23.891
but it may not go well.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.251
Lord Ambrose.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.291
He has influence.

21:35.322 --> 21:38.242
He is also a close acquaintance of
Brigadier Harker.

21:38.283 --> 21:38.986
And Harker...

21:39.017 --> 21:40.891
Is head of the Secret
Service, yes.

21:42.811 --> 21:45.531
And Lord Ambrose and my father were
good friends?

21:45.571 --> 21:47.571
For a while, yes.

21:47.611 --> 21:49.931
For a while? What happened?

21:51.651 --> 21:53.651
They had a disagreement.

21:55.611 --> 21:59.571
It concerned Lord Ambrose's... wife.

22:01.651 --> 22:03.651
Well, that's just perfect!

22:05.971 --> 22:08.651
Do you think he'd still be willing
to meet with me?

22:08.691 --> 22:12.731
I think he'd be curious to see what
the new Lord Hamilton is like.

22:12.771 --> 22:16.571
But be careful. His dislike of your
father runs deep.

22:16.611 --> 22:18.411
If you don't handle him correctly

22:18.451 --> 22:21.371
he has the power to make things a
lot worse for Toby.

22:27.611 --> 22:29.611
Have you got a girlfriend, Toby?

22:29.651 --> 22:33.906
- What?
- A girlfriend.

22:33.931 --> 22:36.731
No. No, I haven't.

22:36.771 --> 22:39.931
You sure about that? Bright young
thing like you.

22:41.331 --> 22:43.331
Nobody new in your life?

22:46.776 --> 22:49.148
There's nobody.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.490
You seem upset.

22:50.515 --> 22:53.651
Of course I am. You're
accusing me of betraying my country.

22:55.063 --> 22:56.663
Toby.

23:01.743 --> 23:03.983
If you're protecting someone...

23:05.223 --> 23:08.103
this is the one chance you get.

23:09.543 --> 23:13.223
The one and only chance when I can
help you.

23:15.343 --> 23:18.663
So, I'm asking one more time.

23:18.703 --> 23:21.023
I've told you already. There's
nobody.

23:24.463 --> 23:27.343
- So, are we finished?
- Toby.

23:29.663 --> 23:31.663
We've only just started.

23:39.412 --> 23:43.332
Good evening. I'm going to play you a
song I wrote. It's called Invincible.

24:16.612 --> 24:18.612
It always feels a bit strange...

24:19.612 --> 24:21.873
that despite everything that's
happening elsewhere...

24:22.077 --> 24:23.835
Life still goes on.

24:24.812 --> 24:26.732
Yeah, well, what are they
going to do?

24:26.772 --> 24:28.772
Lock the door and hibernate?

24:33.292 --> 24:35.292
Do you regret staying here?

24:35.332 --> 24:37.812
No, I'm not a fan of regrets.

24:37.852 --> 24:41.652
- I don't think anyone's a fan of regrets.
- Yeah, right.

24:41.692 --> 24:45.172
- I didn't think that one through.
- A Joe O'Hara special.

24:45.212 --> 24:48.492
- Sounds meaningful b...
- But ultimately empty.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.241
Now I didn't say that.

24:50.266 --> 24:52.668
When I first met you I didn't think
you had a sense of humour.

24:52.692 --> 24:56.092
- Do you realise how insulting that is?
- It's not like I was broadcasting it.

24:56.132 --> 24:58.199
So it's just insulting in your head, then?

24:58.224 --> 25:01.356
Best place for it.
I'm sure you had your opinions of me.

25:01.452 --> 25:04.132
Honestly?

25:04.172 --> 25:06.732
I didn't think you'd last.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.772
Not once things changed.

25:11.812 --> 25:15.372
Well, some things are worth staying
around for.

25:30.732 --> 25:34.892
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for this.
A sign of the times, I'm afraid.

25:34.932 --> 25:37.572
But I assure you it is temporary.

25:37.612 --> 25:41.412
And if you do need a torch, you can
get one from Mr. Reynolds.

25:43.172 --> 25:46.412
- You should've told me.
- I knew how you'd react.

25:46.452 --> 25:49.427
I'm going to throw a drink over him,
glass and all.

25:49.452 --> 25:50.452
Exactly.

25:51.292 --> 25:53.292
You can't do that.

25:55.812 --> 25:57.892
I want you to stay out of this.

25:59.092 --> 26:01.372
Are you going to apologise?

26:01.412 --> 26:04.292
He won't be the last person who has a
problem with us.

26:04.332 --> 26:08.772
I'm not going to spend my whole life
saying sorry when I've done nothing wrong.

26:08.820 --> 26:09.554
You?

26:09.624 --> 26:13.732
If they sack you, I'm walking
out... right by your side.

26:31.572 --> 26:33.972
You really care about the place,
don't you?

26:35.052 --> 26:37.052
I know it's just a job and a hotel.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.452
But it's home as well.

26:42.492 --> 26:44.372
And after what happened, I...

26:44.412 --> 26:46.412
Part of you wishes you were there...

26:47.692 --> 26:50.412
make sure Toby's OK.

26:50.452 --> 26:52.052
Yes.

26:53.252 --> 26:55.252
But part of me wants to be here too.

26:58.772 --> 27:01.412
One more drink and then we'll go.

27:01.452 --> 27:03.452
One or two more drinks.

27:38.932 --> 27:40.932
- He's good.
- Yes.

27:47.932 --> 27:51.372
- Maybe a power surge tripped it.
- When was it last checked?

27:51.412 --> 27:53.772
I don't know.

27:53.812 --> 27:55.812
Billy was in charge of it.

27:57.972 --> 28:00.372
I see.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.932
If I hadn't encouraged him to go and
play soldiers

28:02.972 --> 28:06.372
- he would have been here to do it.
- I arranged Billy's transfer.

28:06.412 --> 28:09.212
If I hadn't he wouldn't have been in
the park and...

28:12.892 --> 28:14.892
Have you been ignoring Peggy?

28:14.932 --> 28:16.932
No.

28:18.812 --> 28:21.612
- Maybe a little.
- She needs our support.

28:23.732 --> 28:26.172
She doesn't think Billy's gone.

28:26.212 --> 28:28.812
She keeps talking about him
like he's still here.

28:28.852 --> 28:32.772
And then... the other day...

28:32.812 --> 28:36.612
she was telling me about this
widow, her son was in the Navy.

28:36.652 --> 28:39.332
He was reported dead.

28:39.372 --> 28:42.012
It was a... clerical error.

28:42.052 --> 28:45.332
- It's as though she's saying...
- Peggy knows.

28:45.372 --> 28:47.372
Of course she knows.

28:47.412 --> 28:50.852
But knowing and believing aren't
quite the same.

29:02.412 --> 29:04.412
It's what Billy used to do.

29:07.252 --> 29:09.852
- No, thank you.
- Come on.

29:09.892 --> 29:12.896
Make you feel better... for a moment
anyway.

29:14.812 --> 29:16.812
- Here?
- Yep, ready?

29:20.652 --> 29:23.492
Again?

29:29.652 --> 29:31.572
Aye, he's a clever lad.

29:47.892 --> 29:51.812
So, I hear that you might have some
family problems.

29:51.852 --> 29:55.292
It's all a misunderstanding. Toby
wouldn't betray his country.

29:55.332 --> 29:57.332
Nobody betrays their country.

29:57.372 --> 29:59.612
They all have their reason.

29:59.652 --> 30:03.212
A brighter future, a better way.

30:03.252 --> 30:06.972
Your father presumably had his own
for seeking to...

30:07.012 --> 30:09.372
shake the hand of the Fuhrer.

30:09.412 --> 30:12.692
My father only discussed appeasement
as a way to prevent war.

30:12.732 --> 30:14.732
See? A reason.

30:16.772 --> 30:19.292
I understand you and he
had your differences.

30:19.332 --> 30:21.052
Really?

30:21.092 --> 30:23.172
What differences were they?

30:25.115 --> 30:27.355
Do you believe I'm loyal
to this country?

30:27.380 --> 30:29.772
You wouldn't have the wings
if you weren't

30:29.812 --> 30:32.572
and I hear you're an ace nearly
twice over.

30:32.612 --> 30:36.532
So, doesn't it seem strange that my
brother would conspire against me?

30:37.852 --> 30:40.972
Don't you see, this is an attack on
people like you and me.

30:41.001 --> 30:42.462
I'm not sure I follow.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.132
You've seen how things have changed
since the Great War.

30:45.172 --> 30:47.612
Lloyd George deliberately

30:47.652 --> 30:50.212
targeted our families and
estates for tax.

30:50.252 --> 30:53.172
We were once respected, now we're
barely tolerated.

30:53.212 --> 30:56.772
There are even calls for the Lords
to be disbanded.

30:56.812 --> 31:01.492
But, no. Instead... Toby Hamilton is
a traitor.

31:01.532 --> 31:03.532
That makes more sense.

31:04.865 --> 31:07.732
Your father would have barked more.

31:07.772 --> 31:09.772
I prefer your style...

31:09.812 --> 31:11.812
even if it is a little feminine.

31:15.772 --> 31:18.212
I can get them to release him.

31:18.252 --> 31:21.292
But I can't get them to stop
investigating.

31:22.972 --> 31:25.212
- I understand.
- I don't think you do.

31:26.612 --> 31:32.292
It's this kind of entitlement, Lord
Hamilton, that creates enemies.

31:32.332 --> 31:35.732
That's the real reason they'll turn
against us.

31:47.332 --> 31:50.212
You can go.

31:50.252 --> 31:52.252
Thank you.

31:53.372 --> 31:56.772
- I knew this was a misunderstanding.
- It's not my call.

31:56.812 --> 31:59.452
Turns out you have influential
friends.

31:59.492 --> 32:02.652
And, frankly, that makes me sick.

32:02.692 --> 32:05.772
- I give you my word.
- Your word means nothing to me.

32:06.932 --> 32:08.932
I haven't finished with this.

32:08.972 --> 32:11.612
Someone leaked that information.

32:11.652 --> 32:14.252
And you can't hide behind your
family forever.

32:15.412 --> 32:17.412
Now get out.

32:22.052 --> 32:25.684
- Thank you for your help.
- You're the one who handled Ambrose.

32:27.612 --> 32:31.412
What are your feelings on...
Mr. D'Aberville?

32:32.452 --> 32:36.692
I think... he's very fond of himself.

32:36.732 --> 32:39.332
But I also think he cares for
mother.

32:39.372 --> 32:41.812
Not just her status?

32:41.852 --> 32:44.652
Well, can you ever remember seeing
her this happy?

32:49.972 --> 32:54.012
There was... one other thing.

32:54.052 --> 32:58.292
What you said to me before, about
staying away from Emma.

32:58.332 --> 33:01.492
I would very much like your
permission to speak with her.

33:03.692 --> 33:07.852
To see if there's any way... she
would consider me again.

33:14.372 --> 33:16.412
I don't wish to see her hurt...

33:17.692 --> 33:20.172
ever again.

33:20.212 --> 33:22.212
You understand that?

33:28.812 --> 33:30.532
Very well.

33:34.772 --> 33:36.772
I have to say...

33:36.812 --> 33:40.252
of all the things I thought you'd
be, a gentleman wasn't one of them.

33:40.292 --> 33:42.292
I do have my reputation to consider.

33:42.332 --> 33:45.452
Well, I'm sure under that suave
exterior

33:45.492 --> 33:47.492
beats a heart of solid...

33:48.812 --> 33:50.812
dirt.

33:50.852 --> 33:53.332
- That's terrible.
- I know, I'm sorry.

33:53.372 --> 33:55.452
There's something about you. You...

33:56.452 --> 33:58.572
bring out the worst in me.

33:58.612 --> 34:00.612
I get that feeling.

34:15.532 --> 34:17.532
Any regrets?

34:17.572 --> 34:19.572
I'm not a fan of regrets, Mr. O'Hara.

34:35.433 --> 34:38.193
I've not gone mad.

34:38.233 --> 34:40.513
I don't actually think he's
coming back.

34:41.885 --> 34:43.885
I just er...

34:46.125 --> 34:48.485
I wake up and everything
feels so empty.

34:49.645 --> 34:51.844
It was just a thought.
A stupid thought.

34:52.925 --> 34:55.324
Something to hold onto and...

34:55.364 --> 34:57.365
it got bigger and bigger and...

34:59.325 --> 35:02.165
Do you miss him?

35:02.205 --> 35:05.565
Only you've hardly said a word to me
since he died.

35:06.724 --> 35:08.747
Er, I didn't think it was my place.

35:10.725 --> 35:13.445
Because if you do miss him...

35:13.485 --> 35:15.885
it would mean the years of life I
gave him...

35:16.885 --> 35:18.885
weren't a complete waste.

35:20.445 --> 35:22.445
It will mean he made a difference.

35:23.845 --> 35:26.605
And I can't tell you what it would
mean...

35:26.645 --> 35:28.645
just to hear you say that.

35:34.285 --> 35:36.285
I miss him a lot.

35:41.285 --> 35:43.725
I um...

35:43.765 --> 35:45.965
I wrote a... poem...

35:47.045 --> 35:49.685
for him, but...

35:49.725 --> 35:52.005
It's not very good but er, I just...

35:53.685 --> 35:55.685
Yeah, just...

36:13.765 --> 36:15.765
My God.

36:17.525 --> 36:19.525
It's terrible, Richard.

36:19.565 --> 36:21.565
I mean, it's heartfelt but...

36:23.325 --> 36:27.125
when he said it wasn't very good
I didn't think he meant it.

36:27.165 --> 36:29.245
I'm sure it's not that...

36:32.405 --> 36:34.765
Dear.

36:34.805 --> 36:37.165
Aw.

36:38.245 --> 36:40.765
Billy would have bloody loved that.

36:42.605 --> 36:45.045
I just...

36:52.485 --> 36:54.485
Thank you.

37:01.045 --> 37:03.605
Mr. Hamilton, welcome home.

37:03.645 --> 37:05.645
Thank you.

37:09.045 --> 37:11.765
- How are you?
- I'm... I'm...

37:11.805 --> 37:13.925
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry I had to intervene.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.045
I understand it's not
what you wanted

37:16.085 --> 37:18.060
but I couldn't let them
treat you like that.

37:18.108 --> 37:20.217
No, no, that's...

37:20.245 --> 37:22.925
- I understand.
- And what happens now?

37:22.965 --> 37:25.645
Well, they might let me continue
working but...

37:26.645 --> 37:29.885
it won't be the same. It's not
fair, you've done nothing wrong.

37:29.925 --> 37:31.805
Thank you.

37:31.845 --> 37:34.045
Sorry, I... It's been a difficult
day.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.085
I think I just need to get to my
room.

37:36.125 --> 37:39.445
Um, Lucian says that mother wants us
all to have dinner.

37:39.485 --> 37:41.485
They're waiting in the suite.

37:41.525 --> 37:43.525
Half an hour.

38:18.245 --> 38:20.565
Have you reconsidered what we
discussed?

38:22.645 --> 38:27.445
I won't apologise to him. I will not give
that man the satisfaction of seeing me beg.

38:28.645 --> 38:31.285
Very well. Then you leave me no
other option.

38:33.005 --> 38:35.005
I will have to deal with him myself.

38:38.845 --> 38:40.845
So, you were bluffing?

38:40.885 --> 38:44.285
I don't know exactly what happened
out there,

38:44.325 --> 38:46.325
but I do know I believe you.

38:57.005 --> 38:59.325
Mr. Hamilton would like you to bring
up some coffee.

38:59.365 --> 39:02.405
- Do you mean Lord Hamilton?
- No. Toby.

39:02.445 --> 39:04.445
He's back home.

39:13.125 --> 39:14.685
Mr. Wilson.

39:14.725 --> 39:18.405
- How are you?
- Feeling unwelcome, Mr. Garland.

39:18.445 --> 39:20.445
May I?

39:24.205 --> 39:28.365
Do you know how many rooms there
are... in this hotel?

39:28.405 --> 39:30.805
- Of course I don't.
- More than you'd imagine.

39:31.845 --> 39:34.645
And a great proportion of them are
at the back,

39:34.685 --> 39:37.805
- where you claim...
- Mr. Wilson.

39:40.405 --> 39:42.845
I would like to apologise for my
behaviour.

39:42.885 --> 39:47.325
It was unprofessional and I... deeply
regret it.

39:47.365 --> 39:51.165
I just hope that you can find the
decency to forgive me.

39:51.205 --> 39:53.205
For I know you are a decent man.

40:04.245 --> 40:06.845
A bottle on the house and we'll
leave it at that.

40:07.845 --> 40:09.845
I'll arrange that now, Mr. Wilson.

40:20.645 --> 40:22.845
You said you wouldn't apologise.

40:22.885 --> 40:24.885
Not for him, no.

40:24.925 --> 40:26.925
I did it for you.

40:28.845 --> 40:31.285
She sings as though
her heart's breaking.

40:35.645 --> 40:38.205
Do you know the best thing?

40:38.245 --> 40:40.245
It's all an act.

40:42.285 --> 40:44.285
She doesn't mean a word of it.

41:04.325 --> 41:06.685
- How's Toby?
- He's a little shaken.

41:08.485 --> 41:12.565
I feel bad for him. The first time he's
found his place in this world and...

41:12.605 --> 41:16.365
- You just wanted to protect him.
- Well, these are difficult times.

41:17.845 --> 41:19.750
Nobody should be facing them on
their own.

41:19.775 --> 41:20.775
What about you?

41:22.085 --> 41:24.125
Well, I have my squad...

41:24.165 --> 41:26.165
And your family.

41:27.325 --> 41:30.165
And, well, I'm still here.

41:35.085 --> 41:37.685
The work is brutal.

41:37.725 --> 41:39.485
And...

41:39.525 --> 41:42.605
I thought it would be better not to
inflict it on others.

41:45.565 --> 41:48.045
But I think I was wrong, Em.

41:49.405 --> 41:51.445
Lord Hamilton.

41:51.485 --> 41:54.165
I am glad to hear that Toby's home.

41:54.205 --> 41:56.085
Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.

41:56.125 --> 41:59.965
Miss. Garland, I was going over your
proposal for the event again.

42:00.005 --> 42:03.405
I did have a few thoughts, if you
wanted to go through them.

42:03.445 --> 42:05.725
Yes, of course. I'll fetch my
notebook.

42:09.365 --> 42:11.365
50 glorious years, right?

42:13.205 --> 42:15.725
The party next week.

42:15.765 --> 42:17.765
I presume you'll be there.

42:17.805 --> 42:20.245
I think I will be, yes.

42:20.285 --> 42:22.245
Good evening, Mr. O'Hara.

42:35.685 --> 42:37.525
Come in.

42:48.885 --> 42:51.405
I was worried about you.

42:51.445 --> 42:53.445
How are you?

42:57.685 --> 43:00.125
What is it? What's happened?

43:02.605 --> 43:04.605
Tell me you didn't betray me.

43:09.405 --> 43:11.285
Say it wasn't you.

43:12.685 --> 43:15.565
I can't.

43:15.605 --> 43:17.605
I'm sorry.

43:19.085 --> 43:21.165
- Is that what all this was about?
- No.

43:21.205 --> 43:23.205
No, no, no, Toby.

43:23.245 --> 43:25.245
Toby, I love you.

43:26.365 --> 43:28.845
I was threatened, my family, I...

43:28.885 --> 43:31.405
- I didn't have a choice.
- Who's threatening you?

43:31.445 --> 43:33.546
Believe me, I never wanted to do it.
I swear to you.

43:33.571 --> 43:34.812
No, I asked you who.

43:40.005 --> 43:41.925
Mr. D'Aberville.

43:49.605 --> 43:51.845
- What are you doing?
- I need to speak to him.

43:51.885 --> 43:54.165
- No, please don't. Don't...
- Don't touch me!

43:54.205 --> 43:56.205
And don't tell me what to do!

43:57.525 --> 43:59.525
I trusted you. And I...

44:03.245 --> 44:04.845
Toby, pl...

44:11.805 --> 44:14.285
Toby. Good to see you back.

44:21.725 --> 44:24.685
- I spoke to Adil.
- Well, I suppose that's a relief.

44:25.765 --> 44:27.765
It means we can... talk freely.

44:28.818 --> 44:30.537
Makes things so much easier.

44:30.567 --> 44:33.965
Easier? I'm not going to let
you get away with this.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.645
No, no, listen. Listen! Listen,
listen to me.

44:37.685 --> 44:41.339
You're already implicated, you and
your disgusting little boyfriend.

44:41.364 --> 44:43.542
Forget the shame you'll bring
on your family.

44:43.567 --> 44:46.205
I'm talking about treason, espionage,
capital offences.

44:46.245 --> 44:48.525
But you... you are going to help me.

44:48.565 --> 44:50.565
- No!
- Yes, you are.

44:50.605 --> 44:54.005
I only need one more thing and then
all of this will be over.

44:55.525 --> 44:58.525
Toby. I was worried about you.

45:00.045 --> 45:02.165
Come on, dinner's waiting.

45:05.710 --> 45:08.288
And look who I found wandering
in the corridor.

45:08.313 --> 45:09.109
Toby!

45:09.205 --> 45:11.205
We were so worried about you.

45:12.565 --> 45:15.049
Have you said a big thank-you
to your brother?

45:15.074 --> 45:16.128
Yes. Yes, I have.

45:16.205 --> 45:18.605
Shall we tell them?

45:18.645 --> 45:20.645
I think we should.

45:20.685 --> 45:23.245
I have an announcement.

45:23.285 --> 45:25.965
Mr. D'Aberville and I...
are to be married.

45:28.925 --> 45:31.405
That's wonderful news.

45:31.445 --> 45:33.045
Thank you.

45:33.085 --> 45:35.805
Yes, I look forward to being a part
of this family.
