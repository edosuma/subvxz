01:13.279 --> 01:18.297
<i>Poa...</i> There sure are lots of paintings
about the old Lion Guards avengers.

01:18.374 --> 01:19.406
Yeah.

01:19.483 --> 01:22.514
But nothing about them
battling an evil lion

01:22.591 --> 01:24.009
who's come back
from the past.

01:24.086 --> 01:25.823
Maybe its never
happened before.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.864
Or maybe you just haven't
seen the right painting yet.

01:28.941 --> 01:32.473
Did you know that all the lair's
caverns have paintings in them?

01:32.550 --> 01:34.127
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

01:34.204 --> 01:37.159
And there are so many caverns,
you wouldn't believe it.

01:37.236 --> 01:38.395
Come on, I'll show you!

Wow!

03:44.423 --> 03:46.461
So much for
wisdom on the walls.

03:46.538 --> 03:50.305
Yep. I say we go show
Scar what's what.

03:51.245 --> 03:53.601
Hmm.
You coming?

03:54.278 --> 03:55.781
What is it, Kion?

03:56.101 --> 03:57.692
I'm not sure.

03:57.769 --> 04:00.590
This painting kinda looks
like the mark of evil.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.903
You mean that symbol
Scar burned in the dirt?

04:02.980 --> 04:04.025
Yes.

04:04.102 --> 04:05.591
That's what Rafiki called it.

04:05.668 --> 04:07.844
This painting
must be important.

04:08.011 --> 04:10.567
So important they didn't
even bother to finish it?

04:10.644 --> 04:13.514
Maybe they stopped painting because
they couldn't paint anymore.

04:13.591 --> 04:15.617
Look! There's no more room.

04:16.238 --> 04:18.945
Or maybe the painting
came first.

04:19.022 --> 04:20.317
Before the rock.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.774
Beshte, think you
can move this rock?

04:22.851 --> 04:24.469
You got it, Kion.

04:24.925 --> 04:26.737
<i>Twende Kibo...</i>

04:28.409 --> 04:30.725
<i>ko?</i>
Whew!

04:30.802 --> 04:32.714
It's really wedged in there.

04:32.791 --> 04:35.086
But I'll get it.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.590
Look at that.
Wow!

04:43.667 --> 04:45.409
A secret cave!

04:47.052 --> 04:48.867
That's the mark of
evil, all right.

04:48.944 --> 04:50.836
And the original Lion Guard.

04:51.146 --> 04:52.961
You were right, Kion!

04:59.765 --> 05:02.895
I think this means the cave
leads to a secret chamber

05:02.972 --> 05:04.625
deep beneath the lair.

05:12.108 --> 05:14.315
Makini, what does that mean?

05:14.383 --> 05:15.424
Well...

05:15.557 --> 05:17.450
It looks like
a long time ago

05:17.527 --> 05:20.171
the lions of the Pride Lands
found a way to defeat

05:20.248 --> 05:21.877
a great evil,

05:21.954 --> 05:24.156
and this chamber
holds the secret.

05:24.245 --> 05:26.047
Then we're going
to that chamber.

05:26.124 --> 05:27.443
Now we're talking!

05:27.520 --> 05:29.225
<i>- Zuka...</i>
- Wait!

05:32.393 --> 05:34.244
This painting's a warning.

05:34.321 --> 05:36.014
The caves are dangerous.

05:36.091 --> 05:38.226
Well, they are caves.

05:38.303 --> 05:40.326
And if there is a powerful
secret down there

05:40.403 --> 05:43.418
the lions of the past would have
wanted it away from prying eyes.

05:43.495 --> 05:45.000
It may be dangerous,

05:45.077 --> 05:48.717
but we're the Pride Lands fiercest,
bravest, fastest, strongest

05:48.794 --> 05:50.134
and keenest of sight.

05:50.211 --> 05:53.899
If anyone's gonna find the secret
to defeating evil, it's us.

05:53.976 --> 05:55.628
You said it, Kion.

05:55.705 --> 05:57.304
Like I was saying,

05:57.381 --> 05:59.022
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

06:00.131 --> 06:03.518
Sorry, Makini, but you'll be
safer if you stay here.

06:03.595 --> 06:07.238
That's okay, I've got all these
amazing new paintings to look at.

06:07.315 --> 06:09.334
Or if they're not new
they're old, but,

06:09.411 --> 06:12.796
the're new to me
and they're all amazing!

06:16.893 --> 06:19.038
Look! Another painting.

06:20.140 --> 06:23.756
Too bad we don't have Makini here to
make it move and tell us what it means.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.718
Don't worry.
I can figure it out.

06:28.186 --> 06:29.219
Mmm-hmm.

06:29.349 --> 06:30.816
Uh-huh.

06:31.356 --> 06:32.768
Mmm.

06:32.861 --> 06:34.127
Well?

06:34.359 --> 06:35.583
Nope. I got nothing.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.126
Want me to go get Makini?

06:37.203 --> 06:40.660
Mmm-mmm. I'm still worried it
might be too dangerous down here.

06:40.737 --> 06:42.581
Yeah. Who knows what
could happen to her?

06:44.603 --> 06:46.193
Whoa!
Beshte!

06:46.270 --> 06:47.735
Beshte!
Huh?

06:56.221 --> 06:58.359
<i>Hapana!</i>
Guys, watch out!

06:58.436 --> 06:59.857
Sharp rocks coming up!

06:59.934 --> 07:02.200
I mean, you're coming down
on sharp rocks!

07:02.277 --> 07:03.286
Uh-oh.

07:04.489 --> 07:06.894
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

07:06.971 --> 07:08.046
Yeah!

07:08.126 --> 07:09.164
Oh...

07:09.241 --> 07:11.343
Beshte! Incoming!

07:11.420 --> 07:13.756
Guys! Land on me.

07:16.301 --> 07:18.539
Everybody okay?
Yep. I'm okay.

07:18.616 --> 07:19.816
Thanks, Beshte.

07:19.893 --> 07:22.821
Oh, good thing we had the Pride
Lands strongest with us.

07:22.898 --> 07:24.417
You said it, Ono.

07:24.494 --> 07:25.874
Okay...

07:25.977 --> 07:27.302
Ono can fly, but

07:27.379 --> 07:29.432
how do the rest of us
get back up there?

07:29.509 --> 07:32.460
Maybe we're not
supposed to. Look!

07:34.320 --> 07:35.967
You think we should
go in there?

07:36.044 --> 07:39.111
The painting said the chamber
was deep beneath the lair.

07:39.517 --> 07:41.162
We're deep,
all right.

07:50.974 --> 07:52.563
Another painting.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.162
Any idea what it means?

07:54.239 --> 07:57.386
I think it means we're on
the right path. Come on!

07:59.546 --> 08:02.060
I hope we're getting
closer to this big secret.

08:02.137 --> 08:03.186
We gotta be.

08:03.263 --> 08:05.488
We're still finding paintings.

08:07.085 --> 08:08.824
So, which way now?

08:10.314 --> 08:11.380
Huh?

08:11.565 --> 08:15.300
I got this. I've got loads
of experience with caves.

08:16.059 --> 08:19.175
Who knows, maybe he
picked the right one.

08:21.299 --> 08:22.972
Or maybe not.

08:23.235 --> 08:25.464
Dead end. Let's head back.

08:25.541 --> 08:29.417
Or, maybe it just looks
like a dead end.

08:31.372 --> 08:33.379
I bet it's another
secret passage.

08:33.544 --> 08:36.124
Like before!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.573
It's just a wall, Bunga.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.515
I don't think so.

08:44.456 --> 08:47.472
Okay... It could be a wall.

08:47.905 --> 08:53.254
Then Askari and his Lion Guard
led the animals to Mizimu Grove.

08:57.818 --> 09:00.602
Oh. I'm kinda far away
from the entrance.

09:00.679 --> 09:01.828
I better go back.

09:01.905 --> 09:04.449
The first painting said
this cavern's dangerous.

09:04.601 --> 09:09.136
Except, all these paintings must
have been painted by a Royal Mjuzi.

09:09.213 --> 09:11.673
And I'm a Royal Mjuzi
in training.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.875
So it should be safe enough
for me to look at

09:13.952 --> 09:16.613
just one more painting,
or two.

09:29.262 --> 09:31.246
Ugh. Another dead end.

09:31.864 --> 09:34.986
Nah. This one's definitely
a secret passage.

09:35.063 --> 09:37.198
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

09:39.507 --> 09:41.703
Why does that keep happening?

09:41.780 --> 09:44.760
Because this path is
nothing but dead ends.

09:44.837 --> 09:46.419
It doesn't make sense.

09:46.496 --> 09:50.558
Why would the paintings lead us down
here if there's no way to get through?

09:52.390 --> 09:55.662
Ono, fly up there and see if you
can get the lay of the land.

09:55.739 --> 09:57.227
Affirmative.

10:03.535 --> 10:05.155
Oh...

10:05.374 --> 10:08.054
I know why we keep
hitting dead ends.

10:08.131 --> 10:09.399
We're in a maze!

10:09.476 --> 10:12.425
And it looks just like that
last painting we saw.

10:12.502 --> 10:15.035
Don't worry.
I'll find the way out.

10:17.482 --> 10:18.929
Hmm.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.743
Got it.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.433
Follow me. This way!

10:30.130 --> 10:31.452
Oh.

10:31.929 --> 10:33.069
Ow!

10:33.201 --> 10:36.683
What wonderful wisdom do you
have for me, new painting?

10:47.230 --> 10:48.581
It's a warning.

10:48.658 --> 10:52.235
Oh, no. Kion! Fuli!

10:52.312 --> 10:55.763
Bunga, Ono, Beshte.
Are you okay?

10:57.255 --> 10:58.628
Good work, Ono.

10:58.705 --> 11:00.526
You got us through.
Happy to help.

11:00.603 --> 11:03.663
I still think I could have
found the secret passageway.

11:04.022 --> 11:07.661
Luckily, we had the keenest of
sight with us so you didn't have to.

11:07.738 --> 11:11.192
Yeah. Just like it was lucky
we had Beshte with us earlier

11:11.269 --> 11:13.585
or we might have been
smashed on those rocks.

11:13.662 --> 11:15.060
Oh, it was nothing.

11:15.137 --> 11:17.899
Wait. What if it's
not luck at all?

11:17.976 --> 11:19.854
What if this is all a test?

11:19.931 --> 11:22.660
We needed the strongest
and the keenest of sight

11:22.737 --> 11:24.948
to get past those
first two obstacles.

11:25.025 --> 11:27.107
All these hidden caves
and challenges,

11:27.184 --> 11:29.599
it's meant to see if
we're a worthy Lion Guard.

11:29.676 --> 11:32.186
Worthy? Of course,
we're worthy!

11:32.415 --> 11:33.964
Worthy of what?

11:34.041 --> 11:36.331
Worthy of discovering
the secret

11:36.408 --> 11:38.112
to defeating great evil.

11:38.189 --> 11:40.776
Yeah. The lions of the past
must have made it

11:40.853 --> 11:43.648
so that only the best of the
best can make it down here.

11:43.725 --> 11:44.774
That's us!

11:44.851 --> 11:48.138
I mean, who else in the Pride
Lands could have gotten this far?

11:48.215 --> 11:49.745
Seriously, who else?

11:49.822 --> 11:52.400
There you are! I'm
so glad you're okay.

11:52.477 --> 11:54.362
- Makini!
- Oh, hey, Makini.

11:54.430 --> 11:57.459
I was just saying that nobody else
in the Pride Lands could get down...

11:57.689 --> 12:00.239
Hey! How did you make
it through the maze?

12:00.316 --> 12:03.248
Oh, that? I just
followed your footsteps.

12:03.408 --> 12:05.389
Oh, good thinking.

12:05.991 --> 12:08.783
Follow our footsteps!

12:08.860 --> 12:11.386
Why didn't we follow
our footsteps?

12:11.463 --> 12:13.244
Because we hadn't
made them yet?

12:13.321 --> 12:15.285
Ah, good point.

12:15.362 --> 12:19.426
Makini? I'm not sure it's a good
idea for you to be down here.

12:19.503 --> 12:21.764
But, Kion, all these
paintings down here

12:21.841 --> 12:24.717
must have been painted
by a Royal Mjuzi, like me.

12:24.794 --> 12:25.844
She's right.

12:25.921 --> 12:28.317
Okay, then just stay close.

12:28.394 --> 12:29.393
Mmm-hmm.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.217
Now that we know
these are tests,

12:31.294 --> 12:33.765
we know it's not
gonna get any easier.

12:34.430 --> 12:36.320
Up here, this way.

12:39.761 --> 12:41.468
Whoa, stop!

12:43.796 --> 12:46.261
There's the path,
over there!

12:46.564 --> 12:50.101
But how do we get to it?
There's no way across.

12:51.369 --> 12:52.710
Is this another test?

12:52.787 --> 12:54.045
I can get across.

12:54.122 --> 12:56.375
You've already
had your test.

12:56.641 --> 13:01.043
Unless this is a test
for the keenest of flight.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.890
Earlier Lion Guards were all lions.
They couldn't fly.

13:05.058 --> 13:08.327
Oh, yeah. Too bad.
Ono would've aced this test.

13:08.404 --> 13:10.410
Hey, guys, over here!

13:10.487 --> 13:13.593
It's a lion on the edge
of the cliff, just like now.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.970
Hey, that's the bravest lion.

13:16.047 --> 13:19.086
That's me!
I'm the bravest lion.

13:19.731 --> 13:21.192
Except the lion part.

13:21.269 --> 13:23.777
So make it move.
Let's see what I do.

13:29.741 --> 13:31.253
That was a lot of help.

13:31.405 --> 13:33.495
He just walked out
into empty air.

13:33.572 --> 13:34.765
I could do that.

13:34.842 --> 13:37.562
Hang on, Bunga.
Let's think about this.

13:37.639 --> 13:39.364
Think about it? Pfft!

13:39.441 --> 13:41.393
Since when do I do that?

13:41.836 --> 13:43.961
<i>Zuka zama!</i>

13:45.328 --> 13:46.571
Whoo-hoo!

13:48.824 --> 13:52.410
Uh, Little B?
How are you doing that?

13:52.487 --> 13:53.696
Oh.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.444
There's a bridge.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.296
There is?

14:00.939 --> 14:03.082
Oh, there is.

14:03.608 --> 14:04.915
<i>Poa...</i>

14:04.992 --> 14:06.367
When did that get there?

14:06.444 --> 14:09.136
Well, it's always been there.
We just couldn't see it.

14:09.213 --> 14:11.323
It's called
an optical illusion.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.930
Aw... I thought maybe
I was the keenest of flight.

14:15.007 --> 14:18.479
I've never seen anything like
an invisible bridge before.

14:18.556 --> 14:21.806
I can't wait to get back
and tell Rafiki all about it.

14:21.883 --> 14:23.712
Better yet, I'll paint it!

14:23.789 --> 14:28.309
And exactly how are you going
to paint an invisible bridge?

14:28.834 --> 14:31.145
Oh, good question, Fuli.

14:39.110 --> 14:42.003
Oh, we're really close
to the final chamber.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.219
The entrance is at
the end of this path.

14:44.296 --> 14:47.065
You mean the entrance that's
blocked by a gigantic rock?

14:47.142 --> 14:49.246
This must be another test.

14:49.343 --> 14:50.676
I don't know, Kion.

14:50.753 --> 14:53.605
I don't think even Beshte
can move a rock this big.

14:53.682 --> 14:55.737
Maybe not. But I can try.

14:55.814 --> 14:58.454
Wait, I've already
had my test.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.434
Maybe it's just a rock.

15:02.765 --> 15:04.909
Did you skip breakfast
today, Big B?

15:04.986 --> 15:06.042
That's not me.

15:07.277 --> 15:08.686
<i>Hapana!</i> The rock!

15:20.852 --> 15:24.795
Ono! Is there anywhere we can get
out of the path of this boulder?

15:27.725 --> 15:29.783
The passageway is too narrow!

15:29.860 --> 15:31.448
I got an idea!

15:41.673 --> 15:43.021
Fuli, what are you doing?

15:43.098 --> 15:46.053
Trying to slow it down!

15:46.717 --> 15:49.507
Good idea, except
it's not working!

15:49.794 --> 15:52.085
So let's try this!

15:52.378 --> 15:56.374
If I can't slow it down,
maybe I can speed it up!

16:10.735 --> 16:12.802
Huh, nice work, Fuli.

16:12.879 --> 16:15.496
- Thanks.
- That was un-Bunga-lievable!

16:15.573 --> 16:17.282
Good thing you're the fastest.

16:21.946 --> 16:25.742
Okay, guys, this is it.
I hope.

16:28.019 --> 16:30.950
So, Kion, we've had tests
for the strongest,

16:31.027 --> 16:34.015
the keenest of sight,
the bravest, the fastest,

16:34.092 --> 16:35.483
even the Mjuzi-est.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.782
What do you think
your test is gonna be?

16:37.871 --> 16:39.429
I'm not sure, Bunga.

16:40.635 --> 16:42.004
<i>Hapana!</i>

16:46.371 --> 16:49.344
So, uh, when do you think
you're gonna get your test, Kion?

16:49.421 --> 16:51.430
Bunga...
Is everyone all right?

16:51.507 --> 16:53.392
- Yep.
- Affirmative.

16:53.469 --> 16:56.900
Me, too.
Except I can't see anything.

16:58.648 --> 16:59.660
Ah!

16:59.737 --> 17:00.777
Makini?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.199
Oh, careful!

17:02.276 --> 17:05.410
<i>Hapana!</i> What if there are more
traps and dangers here

17:05.487 --> 17:06.714
and we can't see them?

17:06.790 --> 17:08.380
Or more
bottomless pits?

17:08.457 --> 17:09.636
Oh, no.

17:09.713 --> 17:11.705
- Look out!
- Careful! - Ow!

17:11.782 --> 17:14.112
Ohh! Everyone stop moving!

17:17.845 --> 17:20.417
Follow my voice,
and get behind me.

17:20.494 --> 17:23.763
Keep coming, that's good.
Everyone here?

17:23.840 --> 17:25.126
- Yep.
- I am!

17:25.203 --> 17:26.627
- Me too.
- Affirmative.

17:26.704 --> 17:29.794
Okay, now I think
I can find the way out.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.787
Hey, was that
another lion?

17:35.864 --> 17:38.903
No, that was Kion's roar
bouncing off the cave walls.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.157
It's called an echo.

17:40.234 --> 17:43.533
Right, and I'm gonna use
it to lead us all out of here.

17:47.062 --> 17:49.721
Okay, there's a wall
to our left.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.525
Okay, and one dead ahead.

17:59.177 --> 18:01.448
Okay, we're going this way.

18:01.525 --> 18:03.545
Everyone stay close.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.292
Nice job, Kion.

18:21.369 --> 18:24.482
If that was a test of
leadership, I'd say you passed.

18:24.559 --> 18:25.767
Indeed.

18:25.903 --> 18:28.521
Wow, look at this place.

18:28.806 --> 18:31.670
Guys? I think we made it.

18:32.143 --> 18:33.818
<i>Poa.</i>

18:33.896 --> 18:35.544
Fascinating.

18:38.927 --> 18:41.699
I never dreamed
it'd be so beautiful.

18:41.776 --> 18:44.987
Look at this painting.
And this one!

18:45.064 --> 18:46.758
Like my dad always says,

18:46.835 --> 18:49.623
"Live long enough,
and you'll see everything."

18:49.923 --> 18:52.520
I don't think he ever thought
I'd see something like this.

18:52.597 --> 18:54.993
Yeah, but where's the secret?

18:55.852 --> 18:57.420
We've come this far.

18:57.502 --> 18:59.466
I think we'll find it, Bunga.

18:59.543 --> 19:01.549
Good, after all these tests,

19:01.626 --> 19:03.854
I'm itching
to fight great evil.

19:06.862 --> 19:08.281
Or maybe I'm just itchy.

19:08.358 --> 19:10.698
Everyone, over here!

19:10.775 --> 19:14.350
I think the story we're looking
for is right here, look.

19:16.451 --> 19:18.943
It all started long ago.

19:20.057 --> 19:22.221
A very evil group of lions

19:22.298 --> 19:24.423
tried to take over
the Pride Lands.

19:24.500 --> 19:28.217
And, in doing so,
they nearly destroyed it.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.075
So, the good lions
of the Pride Lands

19:31.152 --> 19:33.414
created a powerful,
unstoppable force

19:33.491 --> 19:36.529
that could defeat the evil
lions, once and for all.

19:36.628 --> 19:38.053
And it worked!

19:39.110 --> 19:41.815
But only the worthiest
in the Pride Lands

19:41.892 --> 19:44.696
would be allowed to find
this force and use it.

19:44.773 --> 19:47.174
That's us,
we're the worthiest.

19:47.251 --> 19:49.815
But where is this
unstoppable force?

19:49.892 --> 19:51.303
What's the secret?

19:51.656 --> 19:53.423
I think...

19:53.587 --> 19:55.459
It's right...

19:55.536 --> 19:57.771
Over there.

19:58.996 --> 20:01.809
Okay, guys,
we've come all this way.

20:07.572 --> 20:08.820
Everyone ready?

20:08.897 --> 20:12.386
You kidding? Cave of
secrets, here we come.

20:15.413 --> 20:17.992
Makini, will you
do the honors?

20:18.740 --> 20:20.893
Okay.

20:33.498 --> 20:34.830
Huh?

20:38.002 --> 20:40.773
That's... Unexpected.

20:40.850 --> 20:42.752
There's gotta be
more than this.

20:42.829 --> 20:46.510
I know, maybe the
secret's in the water.

20:48.279 --> 20:49.397
Bunga!

20:49.514 --> 20:53.542
Nope, no secret to defeating
great evil in there.

20:53.784 --> 20:55.543
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

20:55.620 --> 20:59.596
Actually, I think
there is, look.

21:00.045 --> 21:04.042
The great force to defeating
great evil is here.

21:04.119 --> 21:06.451
It's us.

21:07.021 --> 21:08.128
<i>Poa.</i>

21:08.205 --> 21:09.205
Oh...

21:09.412 --> 21:10.819
We're the secret.

21:10.896 --> 21:14.218
Well, yeah, that's what
I've been saying all along!

21:14.295 --> 21:15.732
Of course!

21:15.825 --> 21:18.256
It's all right here
in the paintings.

21:18.333 --> 21:21.712
That's the secret they created
to defeat great evil.

21:21.789 --> 21:25.192
Askari's original Lion Guard.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.442
Exactly.

21:28.519 --> 21:31.118
If I had figured that out from
all the paintings earlier,

21:31.195 --> 21:34.112
you wouldn't have had to go through
all those dangerous tests.

21:34.189 --> 21:35.169
Sorry.

21:35.593 --> 21:37.209
Actually, Makini,

21:37.286 --> 21:40.009
I think we had to go
through those tests.

21:40.146 --> 21:42.480
So everyone would know
we were worthy?

21:42.557 --> 21:43.925
So we'd know.

21:44.002 --> 21:47.579
We are the powerful,
unstoppable force

21:47.656 --> 21:50.889
that will defeat Scar,
together.

21:50.966 --> 21:53.149
Because we're the Lion Guard.

21:53.226 --> 21:54.335
Right.

21:54.412 --> 21:56.587
Till the Pride Lands end...
