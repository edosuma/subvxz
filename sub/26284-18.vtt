WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:05.965
Mm-hmm. I'll tell him.

00:07.133 --> 00:09.427
Sheldon, you need to go
to the principal's office.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.762
Ooh...

00:11.846 --> 00:13.431
You do that every time.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.182
Why?

00:15.266 --> 00:18.060
Uh-huh. Okay.
I'll be right there.

00:19.812 --> 00:20.813
What's up?

00:20.896 --> 00:22.773
Principal wants to talk to me.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.567
Ooh...

00:24.650 --> 00:25.943
Grow up.

00:29.739 --> 00:30.740
Hello!

00:31.240 --> 00:32.408
Oh.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.701
What are you doing here?

00:33.784 --> 00:35.870
I got called
to the principal's office.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.955
So did I.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.876
What, you do something wrong?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.587
Not that I'm aware of.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.255
Did you?

00:47.214 --> 00:48.424
I hope not.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.720
Maybe it's good news.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.972
Sheldon, you ever been
called to the principal's office

00:55.056 --> 00:56.056
for good news?

00:56.098 --> 00:58.017
- Never.
- Mm.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.643
Gentlemen, good news.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.020
I had a feeling.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.354
What's up?

01:02.438 --> 01:04.899
We got the PSAT results back,
and Sheldon

01:04.982 --> 01:07.526
got a perfect score.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.445
- Neat.
- Thanks, Tom.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.197
I'll be sure to put that up
on the fridge.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.323
No, you don't understand.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.284
Sheldon's the only kid
in the school to ever do this.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.119
At his age,
maybe in the whole country.

01:17.203 --> 01:19.038
It was fun. I enjoyed it.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.539
So what's this mean?

01:20.623 --> 01:23.209
It means he pitched
a perfect game, George.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.711
I've already gotten calls from
colleges who want to meet him.

01:25.795 --> 01:27.630
For, like,
scholarships and stuff?

01:27.713 --> 01:29.006
For everything!

01:29.090 --> 01:30.633
They might even pay you
to get him.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.469
My man!

01:33.552 --> 01:36.013
When was the last time
you washed your hands?

01:36.097 --> 01:37.723
Come on!

01:39.225 --> 01:42.269
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

01:42.353 --> 01:44.939
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

01:45.022 --> 01:47.525
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:49.860
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:49.944 --> 01:54.073
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:57.785 --> 01:59.078
Can you believe it?

01:59.161 --> 02:00.454
Perfect score.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.832
Good job, moonpie.

02:02.915 --> 02:03.916
And not just that.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.168
Colleges are already sniffing
around to recruit him.

02:06.252 --> 02:08.128
What do you mean, colleges?
He's ten.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.548
Principal Petersen
said Caltech is interested.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.799
Where's Caltech?

02:11.882 --> 02:13.551
California, Mom.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.802
California?!

02:14.885 --> 02:16.637
It has "Cal"
right there in the name.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.473
You're not a part
of this conversation.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.183
The "tech" is for "technology."

02:21.267 --> 02:24.353
Shelly, go to your room.
The adults need to talk.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.106
Given the events of the day,
I would argue I am an adult

02:27.189 --> 02:29.483
and should be treated as one.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.403
I probably could've
said that differently.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.951
You honestly think that
little boy's ready for college?

02:39.034 --> 02:40.929
Hey, I didn't think
he was ready for high school,

02:40.953 --> 02:42.746
but here we are,
a year and a half in,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.665
- and no one got hurt.
- That is different.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.500
He's got you
and Georgie over there,

02:46.584 --> 02:49.920
and he's still living at home
with his mother and his sister.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.463
- And me.
- Sure.

02:51.547 --> 02:52.923
I understand all that.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.217
Then why are you pushing
so hard for this?

02:55.301 --> 02:58.262
Because these schools
are interested now.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.531
It's like football recruitment.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.223
You got to strike
while the iron's hot.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.475
This is nothing
like football.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.519
Oh, yeah?
What if he stops being smart

03:05.603 --> 03:06.883
and they don't want him anymore?

03:06.937 --> 03:08.939
How is that gonna happen?

03:09.023 --> 03:11.442
I don't know. Conks his head?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.111
Will you help me, please?

03:14.195 --> 03:17.031
Sorry, I'm not a part
of this conversation.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.078
At least Dad's on my side.

03:23.162 --> 03:24.747
Doesn't matter.
Mom's gonna win.

03:24.830 --> 03:25.831
She always does.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.209
But I have to leave
for college at some point.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.294
If you went to college,
you know what would happen?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.837
I'd enjoy higher learning?

03:31.921 --> 03:33.047
You would die.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.341
You would curl up on the floor
and die.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.592
That's not true.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.552
You can't even take care
of your own boo-boos.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.512
For your information,
every college is staffed

03:40.596 --> 03:41.805
with a medical professional.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.308
My boo-boos
will be well-tended to.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.852
<i>Sheldon!
Come back in here!</i>

03:46.936 --> 03:48.395
I guess we'll find out
what happened.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.273
I already know what happened.
Mom won.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.484
Well?

03:53.567 --> 03:57.529
Shelly, I am very proud of you
for doing so well on that test.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.074
But you can't go off to college.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.284
- Mom!
- In a few years, sure.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.161
But right now,
you can just keep taking

04:04.245 --> 04:06.497
your one college class
with Dr. Sturgis.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.458
Why can't I go there full-time?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.835
Oh, baby,
it's an hour away.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.088
We can't drive you back
and forth every day.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.965
I'm the one who's
been driving him.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.216
And she loves it.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.009
How can he be so smart

04:19.093 --> 04:21.803
and so clueless
at the same time?

04:21.887 --> 04:25.599
Dr. Sturgis lives at the school.
What if he acted as my guardian?

04:25.683 --> 04:27.017
That's an idea.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.310
A crazy one.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.312
But it would only be
on school nights.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.690
- Shelly.
- What's the point of being intelligent

04:32.773 --> 04:36.402
if I can't take advantage
of opportunities like this?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.365
They're still discussing.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.367
Mom didn't win?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.910
It's touch and go.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.620
Crazy.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.206
Is staying with John
really that crazy?

04:49.290 --> 04:51.542
Yes. He doesn't
know squat about kids.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.127
Why are you even
considering this?

04:53.210 --> 04:56.255
Well, the Lord gave Shelly
these abilities,

04:56.338 --> 04:58.465
and I don't want to be the one
holding him back.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.592
Okay. I'll ask him.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.470
But I'm pretty sure I know
what answer you're gonna get.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.639
Sure! What the heck?

05:10.561 --> 05:12.187
Do you really think
you could handle

05:12.271 --> 05:13.939
living with a ten-year-old?

05:14.023 --> 05:15.899
Oh, he's only biologically ten.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.610
In every other way,
he's as old as I am.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.112
John, I don't think you realize

05:20.195 --> 05:21.905
the responsibility involved here.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.033
Well, why don't we have
a trial run?

05:24.116 --> 05:27.244
Have him spend a couple days
with me and see how it goes.

05:28.037 --> 05:30.039
A trial run, huh?

05:30.122 --> 05:31.540
Like the space program.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.251
You don't send people up
right away.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.045
You start by spinning them around

05:36.128 --> 05:38.213
in that thing
that makes them throw up.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.090
I don't know.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.010
Connie, despite appearances,

05:43.093 --> 05:47.264
I'm not some stereotypical
absentminded professor

05:47.348 --> 05:49.516
who can't take care
of a houseplant.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.934
No, no, I wasn't saying that.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.936
Yeah, maybe I was.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.730
Here's an idea.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.733
Why don't you and Sheldon
come live with me?

05:57.816 --> 05:59.985
And then you can take care
of both of us.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.155
Trial run sounds
like the way to go.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.407
Not ready to shack up, are you?

06:05.491 --> 06:07.076
- No.
- Darn it.

06:07.159 --> 06:10.913
<i>The Earth is about
four and a half billion years old.</i>

06:10.996 --> 06:13.457
<i>- In the Cosmic Calendar, it's...</i>
- Shelly,

06:13.540 --> 06:14.917
we need to talk to you.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.001
All right.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.214
Meemaw spoke to Dr. Sturgis...

06:20.297 --> 06:21.590
And?

06:21.673 --> 06:22.758
And...

06:22.841 --> 06:24.927
he was open to you staying.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.387
Yes! When can I go?

06:26.470 --> 06:28.198
Now, hold on. Before
you get ahead of yourself,

06:28.222 --> 06:29.890
this is just a trial run,
for one night.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.392
And even if it goes well,

06:31.475 --> 06:32.935
you're not starting
college tomorrow.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.271
It's just to see if this is
an option for the future.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.399
- You understand?
- Yes.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.902
<i>The prospect of advancing</i>

06:41.985 --> 06:44.947
<i>to the next stage of academia
had me feeling giddy.</i>

06:45.030 --> 06:47.950
<i>And on top of that,
I got to pack a suitcase,</i>

06:48.033 --> 06:50.035
<i>which is like playing</i> Tetris
<i>but with underwear.</i>

07:13.142 --> 07:15.310
You know, Shelly, it's okay
if you're a little nervous.

07:15.394 --> 07:16.520
You can tell me.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.980
I'm not nervous.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.064
All right.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.192
When I was your age,
a lot of times,

07:22.276 --> 07:24.820
I'd have to spend the weekend
with my grandparents,

07:24.903 --> 07:26.103
and that always frightened me,

07:26.155 --> 07:28.449
'cause they'd leave their teeth
all over the place.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.410
I never told anybody,
but I wish I had.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.455
That does sound upsetting.
Good thing I'm braver than you.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.915
I'm just saying, it can be tough

07:36.999 --> 07:39.626
sleeping in a new place
without your mom.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.296
Dr. Sturgis will be there.
He's like a mom.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.715
But he's really smart.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.511
Welcome!

07:50.095 --> 07:51.763
Come in, come in!

07:53.891 --> 07:55.684
You like chalkboards, huh?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.269
- Indeed I do.
- Huh.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.563
In fact, I even have one
in the bathroom.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.441
You never know
when inspiration will strike.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.235
I may be the luckiest boy
in East Texas.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.737
I know it's Thursday,

08:06.820 --> 08:09.656
so dinner will be
spaghetti and hot dogs.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.492
And for fun,

08:11.575 --> 08:14.870
I have a few episodes
of <i>Cosmos</i> recorded.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.414
Forget "maybe."
I am the luckiest boy.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.876
Remember, it's a school night,
so his bedtime is 7:30.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.753
Mine, too!

08:26.715 --> 08:30.511
<i>♪ So far away ♪</i>

08:30.594 --> 08:35.474
<i>♪ Doesn't anybody stay
in one place anymore? ♪</i>

08:35.557 --> 08:37.808
Shut up, Carole King.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.856
Watching <i>Cosmos</i>
while we're eating dinner?

08:42.940 --> 08:45.317
Am I awake?
Because this feels like a dream.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.778
Oh, not for me.
In my dreams,

08:47.861 --> 08:52.032
I'm usually running for my life
from a giant praying mantis.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.659
That's the insect

08:53.742 --> 08:55.577
where the female eats
the male after mating?

08:55.661 --> 08:56.662
It is.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.331
I think I understand
why you're not married.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.169
This little piggy's looking good.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.129
Hey, baby.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.257
- Hey.
- Need any help?

09:08.340 --> 09:09.883
No.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.635
Do you want to do mine next?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.095
Why?

09:13.178 --> 09:16.181
Well, just seems like a thing
mothers and daughters might do.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.560
What's wrong with you?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.853
Nothing.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.106
Never mind.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.026
Georgie, what you up to?

09:29.152 --> 09:30.153
<i>All my life,</i>

09:30.237 --> 09:33.699
<i>I've wondered
about life beyond the Earth.</i>

09:33.782 --> 09:38.453
<i>On those countless other planets
that we think circle other suns,</i>

09:38.537 --> 09:40.872
<i>is there also life?</i>

09:40.956 --> 09:43.292
<i>Might the beings
of other worlds resemble us,</i>

09:43.375 --> 09:45.919
<i>or would they be
astonishingly different?</i>

09:46.003 --> 09:47.129
Do you believe there's

09:47.212 --> 09:48.630
intelligent life
in the universe?

09:48.714 --> 09:50.215
I have no doubt.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.842
Why is that?

09:51.925 --> 09:54.595
The Drake Equation claims
that there are at least

09:54.678 --> 09:59.600
20 detectable civilizations
in our Milky Way galaxy alone.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.435
Interesting.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.104
My sister likes to say
that I'm an alien.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.898
I've often been called that.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.776
Once by the praying
mantis in my dream.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.487
Maybe we are aliens.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.406
Perhaps.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.700
Or maybe people
like you and me

10:16.783 --> 10:18.660
were the original
inhabitants of Earth,

10:18.744 --> 10:21.747
and everyone else
is from outer space.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.415
Ooh, I like that better.

10:23.498 --> 10:27.002
<i>In the great dark between
the stars, there also are...</i>

10:27.085 --> 10:28.920
After dinner, want
to toast marshmallows

10:29.004 --> 10:30.255
on a Bunsen burner?

10:30.339 --> 10:31.590
Good gosh, yes.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.217
<i>Good morning, everybody.
Good morning.</i>

10:34.301 --> 10:35.903
<i>Angela, look, you know,
I wanted to jot down</i>

10:35.927 --> 10:38.055
<i>some household hints,
you know...</i>

10:38.138 --> 10:40.140
Want to go out and
get some ice cream?

10:40.223 --> 10:41.391
I'm watching this.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.852
Well, when it's over.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.479
Not really.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.814
Okay.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.027
Want to play <i>Monopoly?</i>
I'll let you be the thimble.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.029
<i>And then he said,
"Boy, what a mess.</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:55.697
<i>How about cleaning this up,
huh?"</i>

10:56.239 --> 10:58.200
Well, pooh to you.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.079
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

11:02.162 --> 11:04.456
- What about the little dog?
- Nope.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.460
Finally, we strike
the flint

11:08.543 --> 11:12.339
while turning up the gas
of the Bunsen burner.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.341
I don't say this often,
but that may have been

11:14.424 --> 11:16.009
the perfect safety lecture.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.469
Thank you.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.305
You're my guest.
After you.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.101
This is like
being around a campfire,

11:24.184 --> 11:25.602
only I'm not miserable.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.563
Would you like me
to sing a cowboy song

11:28.647 --> 11:30.774
while we sit around
our makeshift campfire?

11:31.233 --> 11:33.026
I would like that.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.987
♪ Oh, pity the cowboy ♪

11:36.071 --> 11:38.824
♪ All bloody and red ♪

11:38.907 --> 11:41.410
♪ For the bronco fell on him ♪

11:41.493 --> 11:44.079
♪ And bashed in his head ♪

11:44.162 --> 11:47.165
♪ There was blood
on the saddle ♪

11:47.249 --> 11:49.793
♪ And blood all around ♪

11:49.876 --> 11:52.963
♪ And a great big puddle
of blood ♪

11:53.046 --> 11:55.632
♪ On the ground ♪

11:59.594 --> 12:01.054
<i>"N."</i>

12:01.138 --> 12:02.723
<i>And there are two "N" s.</i>

12:02.806 --> 12:03.807
<i>All right.</i>

12:04.725 --> 12:06.351
You want to go bowl
a few frames?

12:06.435 --> 12:08.687
Don't you see me
watching the <i>Wheel?</i>

12:09.229 --> 12:10.480
You can just say "no."

12:10.564 --> 12:12.190
No.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.611
Have you talked
to John tonight?

12:16.695 --> 12:17.821
- Yeah.
- And?

12:17.904 --> 12:21.992
He and Sheldon were watching TV
without anybody yakking at 'em.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.622
I'm going home.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.419
Thanks for stopping by.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.089
Buy a vowel. Buy a vowel.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.887
If you like being tucked in,
I'm prepared to do it.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.680
I practiced on a watermelon.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.057
That's okay. I'm a self-tucker.

12:46.141 --> 12:50.145
Very well. Now, I'll be
in my room if you need me.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.313
Here's a glass of water

12:51.396 --> 12:52.397
if you get thirsty.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.733
And there's fresh chalk
on the blackboard

12:54.816 --> 12:56.818
in case of any
late-night epiphanies.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.403
Excellent.

12:58.904 --> 13:02.657
Oh, and, uh...
if your meemaw asks

13:02.741 --> 13:03.950
how I did tonight,

13:04.034 --> 13:06.495
I hope you'll give me
a positive review.

13:06.578 --> 13:07.746
Three stars.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.956
- Out of three?
- Yes.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.291
Wonderful!

13:17.380 --> 13:18.381
Hi.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.801
- What do you want?
- I baked you a pie.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.010
Why?

13:22.093 --> 13:23.678
Well, I was thinking
we haven't had

13:23.762 --> 13:25.514
the best history as neighbors.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.724
That's 'cause
we don't like each other.

13:27.808 --> 13:31.269
Right, so I thought we could sit
down over a slice of rhubarb pie

13:31.353 --> 13:33.730
and, you know,
forgive and forget.

13:33.814 --> 13:36.858
I haven't done anything
that needs forgiving.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.654
Okay, well,
that sounds like something

13:40.737 --> 13:43.532
we could sit down
and talk about over the pie.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.909
<i>Mom, I'm bleeding again!</i>

13:45.992 --> 13:48.370
You know what, Mary?
I appreciate it,

13:48.453 --> 13:49.579
but this isn't
a great time.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.665
Bobbi stabbed Billy
in the leg with a fork.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.083
Good Lord. Is he okay?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.501
It was a plastic fork,

13:54.584 --> 13:56.628
but it broke the skin
pretty good.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.713
Oh, okay, I... I understand.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.837
How about I take that pie
and give you a rain check?

14:00.966 --> 14:02.217
Um, sure.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.344
<i>I think there's mustard
in the fork holes!</i>

14:04.427 --> 14:05.887
Gotta go.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.347
You can keep the pan!

14:13.854 --> 14:15.605
<i>Sheldon.</i>

14:16.189 --> 14:18.441
<i>Why are you running?</i>

14:19.234 --> 14:21.486
<i>I just want to kiss you.</i>

14:22.654 --> 14:24.823
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.497
Dr. Sturgis?

14:32.581 --> 14:34.165
Oh, Sheldon.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.126
So nice to see you.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.919
I think you tripped
and hit your head.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.588
I'm a bit woozy.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.423
I better test for concussion.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.591
What's your name?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.259
John Burgess Sturgis.

14:44.342 --> 14:47.053
- Burgess Sturgis? Great name.
- Thank you.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.556
Who's the president
of the United States?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.766
George Herbert Walker Bush.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.518
I like Burgess Sturgis better.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.395
'Cause it rhymes, sure.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.731
Last question.
What is the only fermion

14:57.814 --> 14:59.733
that may not have
an antiparticle?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.568
The neutrino, of course.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.194
I'm gonna rule out concussion.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.488
To be fair,
it was an easy question.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.950
True. Wait here. I'm going to go
get some ice for your head

15:09.034 --> 15:10.744
and I'll fix you a hot beverage.

15:10.827 --> 15:15.582
Oh. There's a... there's an
Earl Grey tea bag in the sink.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.251
I think it still has
some oomph in it.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.550
Hey, what you doing?

15:26.176 --> 15:27.761
Pretty much what it looks like.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.679
Would you like some company?

15:29.763 --> 15:32.223
Sure, I guess.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.493
Of course, if you'd rather watch TV,
I could leave you alone.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.312
Oh, no, no. No, it's a rerun.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.647
But even if it weren't...

15:38.730 --> 15:40.148
Ooh.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.742
Hey, what... what's wrong?

15:50.825 --> 15:54.287
Nothing. Keep going.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.917
Mary?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.754
George, I just miss
my little boy so much,

16:02.837 --> 16:06.633
and he's never gonna come back
'cause he doesn't need his mama.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.219
Oh, baby,
of course he'll come back.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.889
No, you should've seen
how happy he was.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.768
All right, well,
we still got Georgie and Missy.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.360
Oh... oh, dear.

16:27.112 --> 16:30.031
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.241
Oh, dear.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.246
Dr. Sturgis,
your tea is on fire!

16:40.041 --> 16:42.585
Boy, it's a good thing
we did this trial run.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.089
No kidding.
Ooh, it's chilly out.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.684
Night.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.479
I changed my mind.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.356
I don't want to leave here ever.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.692
You never have to.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.778
What were you thinking,
letting me take care of a child?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.696
I won't make that mistake again.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.742
Do I look like Mary Poppins?

17:14.325 --> 17:15.535
As smart as I am,

17:15.617 --> 17:18.872
I tried to put out a fire
with oxygen and paper.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.499
It's okay. No one got hurt.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.128
I may actually have had
a concussion.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.422
What are your symptoms?

17:27.505 --> 17:30.592
It feels like there's hair

17:30.675 --> 17:32.260
on my head.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.310
Hey. He okay?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.395
Yeah, he's fine.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.897
How you doing?

17:43.980 --> 17:45.190
Much better.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.904
You know, I just been
sitting here thinking

17:50.987 --> 17:55.283
how I drove an hour both ways
to bring the two of them back.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.285
Pretty damn decent of me.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.956
Come here.
