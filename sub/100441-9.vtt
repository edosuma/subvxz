WEBVTT

00:17.475 --> 00:19.561
- Great work today, you guys.

00:19.644 --> 00:22.230
Sarah, strong finish. I loved that.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.356
Thanks, Ms. Whedon.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.150
Alexis, did you find a ride home?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.526
Yeah, my mom's coming.

00:26.609 --> 00:29.529
Good.  Okay, you guys.
Don't forget to rehydrate

00:29.946 --> 00:31.448
-and get some rest.
- Bye!

01:04.230 --> 01:05.482
<i>Rendell Locke is dead...</i>

01:06.274 --> 01:08.651
- murdered.
<i>-</i> <i>What?</i>

01:10.236 --> 01:11.196
What happened?

01:11.362 --> 01:12.697
<i>You know what happened.</i>

01:13.364 --> 01:14.949
This is all my fault.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.871
What are we going to do?

01:19.954 --> 01:21.289
I know what I need to do.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.444
So how are things over at Key House?

01:52.320 --> 01:55.073
It must be pretty different
now that the Lockes have moved back in.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.576
Actually, none of them
has ever lived there before so...

01:58.660 --> 02:01.204
Right. Good point.

02:01.704 --> 02:05.250
So, not back in, just in.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.045
The raccoons got into the trash
last night.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.215
Otherwise, nothing unusual to report.

02:14.759 --> 02:15.635
Good.

02:17.053 --> 02:20.098
I mean,
I'm glad things are going smoothly.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.851
-Oh.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.645
Keep eating. I'll get it.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.446
Lucas?

02:37.031 --> 02:38.032
Hey, Ellie.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.587
I'm going to need your help.

03:19.782 --> 03:20.742
Hello?

03:21.576 --> 03:22.410
Nina?

03:24.746 --> 03:25.788
Anybody home?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.307
Hey, take off your wet...

04:26.432 --> 04:27.725
-shoes.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.211
- Hello? It's me. Ellie.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.213
Oh, Jesus, Ellie.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.506
It's me.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.218
Oh, God.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.470
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.890
Rufus left one of his guys
and he was having a total meltdown.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.976
- I knocked, but no one was home

05:10.059 --> 05:11.519
so I just, I used Rufus' key.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.939
Ellie,
you can't just walk into my house.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.275
You should have called me first.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.027
-You're right.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.195
You're right. I'm so sorry.

05:22.030 --> 05:26.242
I think it's just when it comes to Rufus,
I lose my head...

05:30.121 --> 05:31.998
I found it, the Crown of Shadows.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.666
-Atta girl.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.086
And the key?

05:39.297 --> 05:40.465
Ellie, where's the key?

05:41.424 --> 05:42.842
I only found the crown.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.802
Well, I guess
you're gonna have to go back again.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.013
But Nina caught me today.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.431
Oh, come on, Ellie.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.768
Without the key
this is just a goth accessory.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.854
A shadow's just a shape on the wall.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.397
Why do you want it?

05:59.692 --> 06:03.404
Where do you keep disappearing to
all the time?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.447
Aw.

06:05.948 --> 06:06.991
Are you jealous?

06:07.075 --> 06:10.328
-Why won't you just answer my questions?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.044
-Shit!

06:18.336 --> 06:19.962
Did he just take my picture?

06:21.547 --> 06:22.590
I'll go talk to him.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.634
I have a better idea.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.446
Hi, Nina. It's Joe.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.618
Yeah, listen, I, uh...
I just saw something

06:51.327 --> 06:52.745
and I can't explain it.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.915
I think I just need to show you.
I'll be home all night.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.714
Hi, Mr. Ridgeway.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.759
I hope you don't mind.
We let ourselves in.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.180
Joe, just give us the cell phone
and we'll... we'll leave, all right?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.433
Yeah, how are you...

07:14.725 --> 07:16.352
How did you get here?

07:17.728 --> 07:19.814
You died 25 years ago.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.274
Joe,

07:21.357 --> 07:24.277
-just give us the phone.
-Not until you tell me what's going on.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.946
It's not going to make any sense to you!
Please!

07:30.783 --> 07:31.742
Please.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.590
Come on, let's go.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.175
I wish I could, but...

07:49.760 --> 07:51.929
as I recall, Mr. Ridgeway, you were...

07:53.806 --> 07:55.391
always a talker.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.851
Listen, I don't want any trouble.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.102
Get off! Get off!

07:58.478 --> 08:00.354
We have the phone.
He's not going to tell anyone.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.107
-What are you doing? Let him go!

08:03.858 --> 08:04.692
Oh, my God!

08:04.775 --> 08:07.111
No! Let him go!

08:07.195 --> 08:09.030
- No!

08:10.323 --> 08:13.576
No!

08:29.133 --> 08:30.510
Oh, my God. It's Nina.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.262
Guess I'll be going.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.681
- What?
- Bye, Ellie.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.436
Lucas, wait!

08:43.272 --> 08:44.232
Shit!

08:53.449 --> 08:54.283
Joe?

08:54.867 --> 08:58.120
-Joe, it's Nina! I got your message!

09:11.842 --> 09:12.718
Joe?

09:15.972 --> 09:16.806
Joe!

09:16.889 --> 09:18.891
Joe! Joe! No!

09:20.935 --> 09:22.478
Oh...

09:23.688 --> 09:26.440
My friend's dead.
He's not breathing.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.193
-There was a plastic bag over his head.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.155
-Joe! Joe!

10:15.656 --> 10:17.116
What took you so long, Ellie?

10:20.828 --> 10:21.871
You used to be so fast

10:21.954 --> 10:23.539
-when you were young.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.892
That really hurts...

10:46.812 --> 10:47.813
my pride.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.776
-Come on, Ellie, why'd you do that, huh?

10:51.859 --> 10:54.570
-You know you can't kill an echo.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.864
I'm already dead.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.284
-You should know that more than anyone.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.371
Do you know what's going to happen
if you don't help me?

11:03.454 --> 11:06.374
I'm going to have to tear
poor Rufus' useless little head

11:06.457 --> 11:07.708
off his skinny little body,

11:07.792 --> 11:09.669
and I'm pretty sure you don't want that,
do you?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.545
Look at me!

11:13.130 --> 11:14.382
You should be happy, Ell.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.509
We're together again...

11:20.471 --> 11:23.140
and we're so close to having
everything that we need.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.443
- So...
- <i>No, Rendell, no!</i>

11:34.860 --> 11:36.654
Lucas and Dodge
are the same person.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.533
How is that possible?

11:41.534 --> 11:45.162
Only thing I'm sure of
is that Dodge will come for the Omega Key.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.040
Do you think it's safe where we put it?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.834
Might be the safest place in the house.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.336
- Hey, guys, look.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.797
I found the Matchstick Key
whispering to me outside.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.215
Sam must have dropped it.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.634
What's that?

11:59.301 --> 12:00.302
Nothing.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.888
-What's nothing behind your back?
- Come on.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.266
-We should get ready for school.
-Yeah, don't wanna be late.

12:05.349 --> 12:06.851
-I want to see it!
-No, okay.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.478
-You, get out, now.
- Stop!

12:10.062 --> 12:12.481
Hey! The only reason why you know
about the keys

12:12.565 --> 12:13.607
is because of me.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.484
Because I shared them with you.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.737
So stop shutting me out!

12:17.820 --> 12:19.071
We're not shutting you out.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.823
-We're--
-You're protecting me.

12:20.906 --> 12:21.866
Yeah, I know.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.617
But you can stop!

12:23.909 --> 12:26.078
I've gone through everything you have.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.998
I'm not a stupid little kid anymore.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.168
Dad said I was very discerning for my age.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.712
He did, huh?

12:35.546 --> 12:36.464
Please.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.674
Let me help.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.351
-It's okay to be upset.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.188
Memories aren't always accurate.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.356
-They can be distorted.

12:54.815 --> 12:55.983
<i>No, Rendell, no!</i>

12:56.692 --> 12:58.944
That's the guy
who's staying at Ellie's house.

13:01.739 --> 13:02.740
What?

13:02.907 --> 13:04.533
You're saying you've seen Lucas?

13:06.827 --> 13:09.205
Rufus said he was his cousin.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.666
There's something weird about him.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.544
I think Rufus is scared of him.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.379
That's because he's Dodge.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.215
They're the same person,

13:19.632 --> 13:20.925
or demon, or whatever.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.052
In Duncan's memory, he used a key

13:23.135 --> 13:24.595
that could change
what he looked like.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.680
So if Dodge has that key...

13:28.933 --> 13:30.810
why would she use it
to make herself look

13:30.893 --> 13:33.896
like our dad's 17-year-old
dead best friend?

13:43.447 --> 13:46.033
When he died,
what did they do with Rendell's body?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.201
Do you remember?

13:49.078 --> 13:51.080
I think they had him cremated.
Why?

13:53.332 --> 13:54.166
Because...

13:54.667 --> 13:58.379
if they hid the Omega Key inside his head,
then it's probably still in there,

13:59.338 --> 14:01.131
along with whatever's left of him.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.011
You're going to go digging around
in Rendell's ashes?

14:06.303 --> 14:07.137
No.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.181
You are.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.439
Mom?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.650
Are you okay?

14:20.109 --> 14:20.943
Yes.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.989
I'm feeling much more like myself again.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.366
I just...

14:30.786 --> 14:31.704
What?

14:31.787 --> 14:32.788
I could've sworn

14:32.872 --> 14:34.373
something happened
to that thing.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.167
No.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.545
It's just been sitting there.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.504
Like always.

14:41.797 --> 14:42.631
Huh.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.759
I must have just dreamt about it then.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.346
I, um...

14:50.514 --> 14:52.016
I'm so sorry, Kins.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.519
There's no excuse
for what I put you guys through. I--

14:55.603 --> 14:57.271
You don't have to apologize.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.023
Not anymore.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.400
It's good.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.735
We're moving forward.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.196
- Good to go?

15:07.615 --> 15:08.449
Yeah.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.039
Bye, Mom.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.481
Bode.

15:40.564 --> 15:41.941
-What are you doing here?

15:42.691 --> 15:43.943
I skipped school.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.694
Are you alone?

15:45.861 --> 15:47.863
-Yes. My mom's at work.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.366
What about Lucas?

15:54.495 --> 15:55.496
How do you know?

15:56.038 --> 15:58.374
Because your enemy is my enemy too.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.418
Only sometimes he's a lady.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.671
When I first moved here,

16:04.004 --> 16:06.006
she was down at the bottom of the well.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.845
After she got out,

16:11.929 --> 16:14.264
she must've changed herself into Lucas.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.185
That explains a lot.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.771
I didn't know how he came back.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.815
What is he anyway?

16:23.065 --> 16:24.942
I'm not sure exactly,

16:25.025 --> 16:26.694
but something bad.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.864
He's the reason Sam killed my dad.

16:45.921 --> 16:50.050
He made my mom steal this
from Key House.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.722
I don't know what it does,

16:55.347 --> 16:56.598
but it must be pretty important.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.935
There's a key you need to use it,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.104
but my mom couldn't find it.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.191
I think I've seen
that design before,

17:06.775 --> 17:08.777
but I can't remember where.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.778
No!

17:09.862 --> 17:12.573
He could walk in any time.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.415
My mom made me promise
not to talk about him.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.127
-You should go. It's not safe.
-Rufus.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.796
We're fellow soldiers, remember?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.550
We can battle this out together.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.261
How?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.182
I'm going to find that key.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.226
I can hear them whisper sometimes,

17:41.935 --> 17:45.522
and then we'll use that crown
as a weapon against Dodge.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.357
I mean, Lucas.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.943
You've just got to trust me, okay?

Eden! What's going on?

18:35.030 --> 18:37.282
- Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay, she just...

18:45.207 --> 18:47.960
Do you not have anything better to do
in your morning?

18:48.335 --> 18:50.003
Um... What are you talking about?

18:50.087 --> 18:51.630
God, you are so pathetic.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.549
You and your Santorini squad.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.009
I will tell you this once.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.721
You do not want to mess with me, Kinsey.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.185
<i>♪ Send me a signal ♪</i>

19:13.318 --> 19:14.278
Ellie.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.320
Ellie!

19:16.071 --> 19:17.322
How can I help you, Kinsey?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.533
-Cut the bullshit.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.744
I know about the keys,
and I know about Lucas.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.829
He's staying with you.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.748
Bode saw him when he was at your house.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.793
Well, Bode must have been mistaken.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.044
No, he wasn't.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.588
Look, Kinsey, this...

19:32.671 --> 19:35.424
this is not appropriate.

19:36.049 --> 19:36.884
Goodbye.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.386
I'm not gonna let you
lie to me anymore.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.597
Why are you helping him?

19:47.561 --> 19:49.229
Because I don't have any choice.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.773
Do you know what he's done...

19:52.816 --> 19:54.818
to us? To my dad?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.280
How could you ever be a part of that?

19:59.823 --> 20:02.326
I am doing what I have to do
for my family.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.079
And if you're smart, you'll do the  same.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.710
I don't know, Eden.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.754
You sure it wasn't the gardener
with the hunchback?

20:55.837 --> 20:56.755
He's pretty terrifying.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.091
Yes, I am sure. It was Kinsey,

20:59.716 --> 21:02.594
but the 4:00 a.m.
after an all night kegger version,

21:03.178 --> 21:08.141
and her eyes were bloodshot
and her hair was gross.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.394
Ellie admitted Lucas was there.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.146
-She said she didn't have a choice

21:13.230 --> 21:15.190
and she seemed really scared.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.278
Dodge is too powerful.
We can't go up against her by ourselves.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.737
So what are you proposing?

21:22.447 --> 21:23.365
We need some help.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.784
We should tell our friends.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.788
Scot and Gabe already know too much.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.917
No, shutting people out isn't the answer.
I mean, this is some other worldly shit

21:34.001 --> 21:35.711
-we're up against.
- Hey!

21:37.587 --> 21:38.922
I'm not finished with you.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.757
What did you do now?

21:41.049 --> 21:42.884
-I have no idea.
- You know,

21:42.968 --> 21:45.595
I always thought
that you were a freak.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.973
Maybe she found out
about the music box prank?

21:48.056 --> 21:50.392
This is exactly why we can't tell anyone
else about the keys.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.310
Let's just go.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.980
You're not so scary now without your claws
and your monster makeup, are ya?

21:58.025 --> 21:59.151
My claws?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.445
Seriously, you're gonna play dumb?

22:04.072 --> 22:05.449
- Eden!

22:10.620 --> 22:11.621
Get off of me!

22:18.253 --> 22:20.255
What the hell?

23:27.823 --> 23:29.825
Mom. What are you doing?

23:30.158 --> 23:31.535
We're leaving town.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.370
It's not safe here anymore.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.957
Lucas wants me to do something and...

23:37.082 --> 23:38.166
I won't do it.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.377
-And the Locke kids are asking questions--
-I know.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.801
Bode came by earlier.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.721
What did you tell him?

23:51.805 --> 23:54.391
He's going to try to find
the key to the crown.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.601
-Do you remember what I said to you?
-I'm sorry, Mom.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.938
-I know I made a promise,

24:00.981 --> 24:02.149
but I had to.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.776
We need reinforcements.

24:06.361 --> 24:07.362
I'm sorry.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.365
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.576
You didn't do anything wrong.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.494
-It's okay.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.164
If we run, we'll always be afraid.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.916
I'm sick of being afraid.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.215
If I thought there was a way
to fight back...

24:29.342 --> 24:30.427
Come with me.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.060
- He thinks I'm dumb,

24:39.144 --> 24:40.353
that I don't see...

24:44.024 --> 24:45.066
but I do.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.325
-Did you show these to Bode?

24:54.618 --> 24:56.286
I wanted to show you first.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.752
Uh...
Is any of this making any sense?

25:06.505 --> 25:09.925
Okay.
So your house is full of magical keys

25:10.967 --> 25:14.679
and there's this demon chick
who wants to take them

25:14.763 --> 25:17.516
so she can open a black door.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.600
Mm-hmm...

25:18.975 --> 25:20.685
Yep. And, uh...

25:21.937 --> 25:23.271
and Ellie Whedon is helping her.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.232
Him, under duress.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.693
The gym teacher. Well, of course.
Now it's getting interesting.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.656
This has been going on
the whole time?

25:32.739 --> 25:35.408
Yeah, since we moved here. Yeah.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.869
-Pretty much.
- I don't know, man.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.955
Do you have, like, some proof or...

26:01.309 --> 26:02.269
Whoa.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.024
Okay...

26:08.108 --> 26:09.859
- That's not bad.
- Um...

26:10.860 --> 26:12.946
I'm going to go check on Eden.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.413
Shit.

26:22.622 --> 26:26.459
I haven't seen those feral cats
roaming around the school for years.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.546
Yeah, it's pretty unbelievable, isn't it?

26:31.131 --> 26:32.257
You poor thing.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.760
You just rest while I run
and get some more gauze.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.352
So you didn't attack me,

26:44.436 --> 26:46.896
but something that looks
a hell of a lot like you did.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.941
You care to explain that?

26:52.235 --> 26:54.446
No, I really can't.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.365
I felt that thing's breath on my face.

26:59.659 --> 27:00.493
It was...

27:01.161 --> 27:03.455
It was like some kind of, like...

27:04.539 --> 27:07.167
-Monster?
-Yeah, but that's insane.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.711
I agree. It's all insane.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.840
Look, it's a lot to get into right now,
but...

27:14.716 --> 27:15.884
that thing...

27:17.344 --> 27:18.386
it's my fear.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.556
What the hell are you talking about?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.266
It used to live inside my head.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.479
Now it's out and it attacks
anything I'm afraid of.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.192
You're afraid of me?

27:32.651 --> 27:33.526
Yeah.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.195
You're intimidating.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.823
You're also kinda cruel to people.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.035
Are you seriously blaming the victim
right now?

27:42.118 --> 27:42.952
No.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.830
This is definitely my fault.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.920
Well, I'm kinda flattered.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.050
Jackie! Hey!

27:57.634 --> 27:58.885
Slow down.

27:58.968 --> 27:59.803
Are you okay?

28:02.847 --> 28:03.765
Not really.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.267
Fear monsters? Demons?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.061
-Magical keys?
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.854
It's a lot to take in. Yeah.

28:11.231 --> 28:15.110
I'm sorry, I just...
I need a minute, okay?

28:16.486 --> 28:18.488
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.494
So I guess you told her, huh?

28:27.664 --> 28:28.957
How'd Eden react?

28:30.083 --> 28:31.501
Surprisingly well.

28:34.838 --> 28:35.672
Uh...

28:35.755 --> 28:37.590
I'm gonna go get some snacks for everyone.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.300
-You want anything?
-I'm good.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.056
Eden okay?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.517
-Yeah, she'll be fine.
- Good.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.518
Good.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.479
I mean, she's not exactly
my favorite person in the world,

28:51.563 --> 28:54.441
but life would be a lot less interesting
without her, right?

28:54.524 --> 28:57.861
So, she got attacked
by a seven pound feral cat?

28:58.570 --> 29:01.030
- 'Cause that makes total sense.
- Mm-hmm...

29:02.157 --> 29:04.159
Okay, here's what actually happened.

29:06.494 --> 29:09.205
I used one of the keys
to take the fear out of my head.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.335
And everything was great for a while.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.006
Then things got messed up.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.634
I let myself get close to you...

29:23.011 --> 29:24.888
even though we were already a thing.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.393
I wasn't worrying about the consequences.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.606
- You're both amazing.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.567
I mean, that's the problem.

29:38.985 --> 29:40.862
I know I should choose, but...

29:42.447 --> 29:43.823
I don't want to.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.164
What if I didn't?

29:52.874 --> 29:54.501
What if I dated you both?

29:58.755 --> 30:00.089
- So--
-Think about it.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.716
-Just give me a sec.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.261
-Hello?
<i>-It's Ellie. I--</i>

30:05.512 --> 30:07.096
<i>I thought about what you said.</i>

30:08.181 --> 30:09.474
<i>Can we meet at Key House?</i>

30:52.600 --> 30:53.518
Nina.

30:55.311 --> 30:56.145
Detective.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.899
-Daniel.  Hi.
-Uh...

30:59.983 --> 31:01.568
Are you... you going to the meeting?

31:03.486 --> 31:05.530
I, uh... I thought so, but...

31:07.115 --> 31:09.033
I don't think I'm in the right place.

31:09.492 --> 31:12.829
Ah. Well, maybe...

31:13.413 --> 31:15.915
-you'd like to get some coffee instead?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.046
-Come on.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.639
You have to understand, I was doing
what I thought was best for my son...

31:35.727 --> 31:37.270
but I'm done being afraid.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.316
Lucas, the one that I knew,

31:42.609 --> 31:43.651
was sweet

31:44.569 --> 31:45.653
and charming.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.531
Dodge, that was my nickname for him.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.116
He was on the fencing team.

31:50.825 --> 31:53.369
It's a little cheesy,
I know, but...

31:56.122 --> 31:58.958
Now that name means something
completely different to me.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.628
What happened to him?

32:03.963 --> 32:07.800
The night after graduation,
we had a sleepover here in the basement,

32:08.968 --> 32:11.179
but Rendell wanted to go down
to the caves.

32:11.804 --> 32:14.599
A few weeks earlier,
we had found this door down there.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.061
Yeah, we know about it.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.648
Your father became obsessed
with getting it open,

32:22.774 --> 32:23.816
and we all went

32:23.942 --> 32:27.612
because the keys had only brought
good things into our lives.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.238
How do you remember any of it?

32:30.031 --> 32:31.658
The keys, the magic?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.994
We thought after you become an adult,
you forget.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.247
We found a way to remember.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.211
After Rendell opened the black door,

32:43.628 --> 32:45.838
there was this bright, blue light.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.548
Then, these...

32:48.007 --> 32:50.051
things shot out from the other side

32:50.343 --> 32:52.929
like... like bullets, glowing bullets.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.808
I saw one of them hit Lucas.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.397
Rendell and Lucas
managed to get the door closed again

33:03.898 --> 33:05.483
and Lucas said he was fine,

33:06.693 --> 33:08.111
and he did seem fine.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.867
But later...

33:20.373 --> 33:22.375
I think it's easier if I just show you.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.273
-What?
- Rufus and Bode,

33:45.356 --> 33:46.441
you two stay here.

33:46.649 --> 33:47.817
Keep watch. We won't be long.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.421
We got back from the caves
later that night,

34:09.672 --> 34:10.965
tried to get some sleep,

34:11.632 --> 34:13.634
after opening the black door

34:14.469 --> 34:16.387
and that's when it started with Lucas.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.727
Just hand it over, Mark.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.229
Hey, shh, be quiet!
Everyone's asleep! What do you want?

34:25.313 --> 34:26.939
Hand it over. I know you have it.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.483
- What are you talking--
-Lucas?

34:28.566 --> 34:29.984
What is wrong with you?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.403
Give me the Omega Key.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.030
Lucas, what's going on?

34:34.113 --> 34:36.365
-He's acting crazy.
-I know you have it.

34:37.033 --> 34:39.535
- Dude, just calm down.
-Lucas, what are you doing? Lucas?

34:39.619 --> 34:40.828
- What the hell?
-Stop!

34:41.788 --> 34:43.539
- Lucas!
- Make him stop.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.625
- Lucas!
- Just give me

34:45.708 --> 34:46.876
what I want!

34:46.959 --> 34:48.711
Stop it! What are you doing?

34:48.795 --> 34:50.505
Let him go!
What are you doing?

34:50.588 --> 34:51.547
Stop!

34:51.631 --> 34:53.382
- What are you doing?

34:54.008 --> 34:55.760
- Kim!

35:01.265 --> 35:03.601
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

35:03.726 --> 35:05.812
No, no, what did you do?

35:07.647 --> 35:09.649
-He's not Lucas anymore.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.567
- What is wrong with you?
- Jeff?

35:13.569 --> 35:15.279
- Jeff!

35:15.947 --> 35:16.781
Kim!

35:16.948 --> 35:18.199
What are you doing?

35:19.992 --> 35:21.077
Your turn.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.044
-No! No,

35:30.128 --> 35:31.629
-Rendell, no!

35:48.187 --> 35:49.105
Rendell?

35:51.649 --> 35:53.067
Duncan saw what happened.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.028
We had no choice.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.490
We had to remove his memories...

36:00.908 --> 36:02.994
put them some place he wouldn't find them.

36:04.537 --> 36:05.538
The tree.

36:10.710 --> 36:11.878
When Lucas got hit

36:13.004 --> 36:15.214
by whatever came across
from the other side,

36:16.883 --> 36:19.343
some kind of demon attached itself to him.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.685
We created a story
about how our friends had died.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.565
It was easier
than trying to explain the truth.

36:33.983 --> 36:36.485
No one would have believed
what really happened.

36:37.528 --> 36:41.365
So we told everyone that we went down to
the caves and our friends drowned...

36:42.700 --> 36:46.245
and the bodies washed out to sea
and they were battered on the rocks.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.314
We divided up the remaining keys
and we made a pact

37:13.731 --> 37:16.275
to protect them and never use them again.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.737
Rendell took the Anywhere and Omega Keys,

37:19.820 --> 37:21.489
-Erin took the Head Key,

37:22.198 --> 37:24.158
and Mark took the Matchstick Key.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.952
Mark hid the rest in the house.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.745
He was the most trustworthy of us all,

37:27.828 --> 37:30.414
so it made sense that he should know
where all the keys were hidden.

37:30.539 --> 37:34.168
That's why he killed himself,
so no one could ever get inside his head,

37:34.877 --> 37:36.254
to protect the keys.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.463
What about you?

37:38.839 --> 37:39.966
What did you take?

37:41.425 --> 37:44.345
The Identity Key and the Echo Key.

37:45.471 --> 37:46.430
The Echo Key?

37:47.431 --> 37:48.933
It can bring people back...

37:51.519 --> 37:53.354
but not in the way that I thought.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.156
If we can't find the key,

38:04.240 --> 38:06.409
we should get the traps up
around the perimeter

38:06.492 --> 38:09.996
in case he or she or whatever shows up...

38:11.706 --> 38:13.207
The traps didn't work.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.836
The key ring! That's it.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.838
-The key ring?

38:27.972 --> 38:31.058
I knew I'd seen it before.

38:36.772 --> 38:40.276
I tried to move on
with my life...

38:41.444 --> 38:42.653
but I couldn't.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.073
I couldn't let go of Lucas.

38:47.241 --> 38:50.077
Other people, their lives get bigger...

38:50.661 --> 38:51.579
fuller...

38:53.539 --> 38:55.416
I just felt like I was disappearing.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.045
And last year, I...

38:59.503 --> 39:00.963
I hit my breaking point...

39:03.299 --> 39:05.051
and I came to the Well House.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.177
Lucas Caravaggio.

40:07.571 --> 40:08.531
Ellie.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.829
Lucas! Is that you?

40:19.959 --> 40:21.085
-I'm here, Ellie.

40:25.756 --> 40:26.590
Lucas!

40:32.972 --> 40:34.974
I promised
I wouldn't use the key...

40:37.101 --> 40:39.103
but I just missed you so much.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.566
Do you have any others?

40:51.657 --> 40:52.825
Just this one.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.330
I know you can't leave this place, but...

40:59.331 --> 41:01.000
at least I can see you now.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.299
I can leave.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.469
If you give me the Anywhere Key.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.681
Rendell has it.

41:15.764 --> 41:16.891
Then get it from him!

41:21.896 --> 41:22.730
Hey, no, I'm...

41:23.272 --> 41:24.106
I'm sorry.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.902
I'm just... I'm just frustrated.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.530
I want to get out of here
so I can be with you.

41:33.908 --> 41:37.953
I want that, too, Lucas.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.043
That thing wasn't an echo of Lucas.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.713
I didn't know
that when I called out his name

41:47.796 --> 41:49.423
I wasn't bringing him back.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.176
I was bringing back...

41:53.093 --> 41:55.638
the demon
that possessed him when he died.

41:56.013 --> 41:58.766
- You couldn't have known.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.978
The Keepers, we made a pact.

42:04.396 --> 42:05.981
I broke that pact.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.650
This is all my fault.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.531
I just thought I could have him back.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.039
-We should go.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.179
When Bode met Dodge,

42:37.888 --> 42:39.056
he was a she.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.434
She can use the Identity Key
to transform into any form

42:42.518 --> 42:43.978
she thinks will be most useful.

42:44.061 --> 42:46.272
So Dodge is... an echo.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.316
How do we get rid of it?

42:49.858 --> 42:51.485
It can't be killed by normal means,

42:51.569 --> 42:53.112
believe me, I've tried,

42:54.071 --> 42:56.073
but it can be trapped in the Well House.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.617
The problem is getting it in there.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.286
We have a way.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.710
It's the key
for the Crown of Shadows.

43:08.294 --> 43:09.503
Whoever wears the crown

43:09.587 --> 43:11.964
can create and control powerful shadows.

43:12.548 --> 43:14.216
It'll do whatever they want.

43:14.883 --> 43:15.718
Like...

43:16.051 --> 43:18.470
force a demon echo into a Well House?

43:18.554 --> 43:19.680
Exactly like that.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.933
-So where is this crown?
-It's back at my place.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.393
I'll get it.

43:24.852 --> 43:26.145
We'll be here waiting.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.800
What do you got there, Ellie?

43:59.553 --> 44:00.512
Lucas.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.641
You've had a busy day.

44:06.393 --> 44:08.354
Seems someone's been rummaging
through my things.

44:10.773 --> 44:11.982
I took the Head Key.

44:14.568 --> 44:15.402
Why?

44:17.613 --> 44:19.114
I went to Key House

44:19.615 --> 44:21.825
and tried to find the Omega Key
in the ashes,

44:21.909 --> 44:22.910
but it wasn't there.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.164
The Locke kids must have found it first.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.543
I thought I could use it on them
to see where they put it.

44:33.003 --> 44:33.962
And did you?

44:34.713 --> 44:36.090
They weren't home.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.593
-I can try again tomorrow.
- Ellie! Stop it!

44:40.594 --> 44:41.804
You're embarrassing yourself.

44:45.724 --> 44:47.351
- Rufus!

44:47.851 --> 44:49.853
Oh, my God. Rufus!

44:49.937 --> 44:52.439
- Rufus! Rufus!
- Look at that,

44:52.981 --> 44:53.982
what you found.

44:55.526 --> 44:58.278
-That's very helpful. Thank you, Ellie.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.532
Let me go.

45:05.077 --> 45:06.745
Rufus.

45:07.329 --> 45:10.582
- Rufus, are you okay?

45:11.959 --> 45:13.419
Oh, my God.

45:14.002 --> 45:15.087
