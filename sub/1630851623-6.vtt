Enough about me.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.703
You died ages ago, Oscar.

21:09.746 --> 21:13.097
I assumed you would have
moved on to Peace by now.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.447
Mm, mm, for some reason,

21:14.490 --> 21:16.971
I don't have one
of those blasted coins.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.102
Perhaps I wasn't

21:18.146 --> 21:19.582
as good a man as I thought.

21:19.626 --> 21:20.844
NECROMANCER: No.Ah,

21:20.888 --> 21:22.019
but no matter,

21:22.063 --> 21:23.760
I wouldn't have wanted
to go anyway.

21:23.804 --> 21:26.633
I needed to stay and see
how it all turned out.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.853
Just in case you were able
to bring me back.

21:29.897 --> 21:33.770
After a while, I realized
it probably hadn't worked.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.991
You mustn't beat yourself up

21:37.034 --> 21:38.601
about it.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.299
[clears throat softly]

21:40.342 --> 21:41.778
Oscar?

21:41.822 --> 21:43.302
Sorry.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.391
Can you give
us a moment?

21:52.006 --> 21:55.444
I think I know how to get
one of those coins.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.670
JOSIE:
I didn't want to believe it.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.194
What Cleo said was right?

22:06.237 --> 22:08.631
You wanted a spell.
I found one.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.198
You can't go through with this.

22:10.241 --> 22:13.332
Why? Because it has nothing
to do with helping Hope?

22:13.375 --> 22:14.942
Because we're not murderers.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.466
People die in that hospital
every day.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.382
We just need to find someone
who's really sick.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.471
Dying a day early
won't make a difference.

22:22.515 --> 22:25.169
Plus, we'll be saving
a life, too.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.911
Dad wouldn't want to come back
this way, and you know that.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.567
I actually found this spell
in his journal.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.526
I've read
a few of them now.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.136
And there was a time in his life

22:35.179 --> 22:37.834
when there was no such thing
as too far.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.271
If you're not gonna listen
to me, you should know

22:40.315 --> 22:42.056
the Squad is outside.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.406
There's no way you can
get through all of them.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.842
No.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.844
But thanks
to this Illusion Ring,

22:47.888 --> 22:49.542
youcan.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.374
I'll tell the gang

22:55.417 --> 22:57.114
Lizzie needs to rest
for a bit.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.638
Ad somnum.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.564
I guess my old code
still works.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.392
But that'll only get us
so far.

23:13.435 --> 23:17.918
Supposedly, there's some sort
of elaborate security system.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.007
We'll need to find a way
to sneak into the records room

23:20.050 --> 23:21.225
without drawing
too much attention.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.140
Don't draw attention.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.838
Got it.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.884
[alarm blaring]

23:27.928 --> 23:30.496
I figured the followers
of the O.G. Triad

23:30.539 --> 23:31.801
would have laid a trap for us.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.456
It's what I would do.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.762
Told ya.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.940
[grunting]

23:44.597 --> 23:45.728
You know,
instead of sneaking around,

23:45.772 --> 23:47.513
why don't we have some fun?

23:49.602 --> 23:50.994
[growls]

23:51.038 --> 23:52.343
[grunting]

23:52.387 --> 23:54.215

[neck cracks]

24:06.270 --> 24:08.185
[grunts]

24:08.229 --> 24:09.970
Admit it,

24:10.013 --> 24:13.060
you're enjoying yourself
just a teensy little bit.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.063
[grunts]

24:16.106 --> 24:17.804
[exhales]

24:17.847 --> 24:19.458
Yeah.

24:23.070 --> 24:27.683
If Landon's dizzying knowledge
of ghost stories is correct,

24:27.727 --> 24:29.076
you're stuck here

24:29.119 --> 24:30.773
not because of some wrong
you've committed,

24:30.817 --> 24:33.689
but because you and I have
unfinished business.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.952
In order to move forward,

24:35.996 --> 24:37.954
I think you need to know
the truth.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.435
[exhales]

24:40.479 --> 24:43.003
I didget the power.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.441
I just never brought you back.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.399
Or anyone who deserved it.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.967
In fact,
I never even tried.

24:51.011 --> 24:54.623
At the end of the day, I just
wanted the power for myself.

24:54.667 --> 24:57.017
I was a tyrant.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.801
You...

24:58.845 --> 25:00.194
used me?

25:00.237 --> 25:01.630
Yes.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.806
Because I knew you were
a very good person

25:03.850 --> 25:06.853
who would do anything
for someone you loved.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.421
It doesn't change anything,

25:10.465 --> 25:12.293
but what I did was wrong,

25:12.336 --> 25:15.165
and I honestly hope you can find
it in your heart to forgive me.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.560
You're telling me this because
you want me to forgive you,

25:18.604 --> 25:20.649
so you can be at peace.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.216
It's so you

25:22.259 --> 25:23.391
can get on the boat.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.958
You're using me all over again.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.395
No, I'm telling you
because I'm hoping the truth

25:27.438 --> 25:29.528
will set you free.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.400
[whispers]:
Hey.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.968
And it wasn't all fake.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.755
I did love you, Oscar.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.758
Your companionship
was a very...

25:42.802 --> 25:46.762
rare and...
it was a beautiful thing.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.287
I should never
have thrown it away.

25:51.288 --> 25:52.855
Will you forgive me?

25:52.899 --> 25:56.119
Not for my sake,
but because I want you to leave

25:56.163 --> 25:58.078
this misplaced trust in me
behind.

25:58.121 --> 26:01.603
I don't want you to miss out on
a chance at Peace because of me.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.866
And that's the truth.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.276
[chuckles softly]

26:23.930 --> 26:26.323
MG:
You were right.

26:28.891 --> 26:31.024
The Squad does have
a problem.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.808
We need leaders
to step up.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.768
But you cannot be one of them.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.422
That's how yousee it.

26:38.466 --> 26:39.946
That's how they all
see it.

26:39.989 --> 26:43.384
You cannot lead a team
that doesn't trust you.

26:43.427 --> 26:46.082
You know what I did,
I did for Cleo.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.084
I also know that it didn't work.

26:48.868 --> 26:51.435
Josie saved Cleo
with the team's help.

26:51.479 --> 26:52.872
And I know

26:52.915 --> 26:55.135
that's why you've been
so hard on yourself.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.137
You're trying to fix
your mistake.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.662
But you can't take that out
on the team.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.708
You've got to earn
their trust back.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.187
Until then,

27:04.231 --> 27:05.580
you're benched.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.713
[running steps approaching]

27:09.889 --> 27:11.281
I thought you left.That was Lizzie.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.153
She knocked me out.
I think that she's trying

27:13.196 --> 27:15.068
to do the spell.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.334
Go.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.553

we could.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.393

27:42.182 --> 27:44.401
CLARKE:
This looks bad.

27:45.881 --> 27:49.232
[deep growling]

27:53.019 --> 27:55.151
I'm not enjoying myself
anymore.

27:55.195 --> 27:57.806
Hope, that's an Argus.Usually, I'd just go down there

27:57.850 --> 28:00.417
and kill it
single-handedly, but...

28:00.461 --> 28:02.681
I think I want to use you
as my bait.

28:02.724 --> 28:03.812
Think of it

28:03.856 --> 28:05.335
like your final exam.

28:05.379 --> 28:06.685
Hope, don't.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.382
Time to find out
which guy you are.

I need a second. Hold on.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.747

31:19.790 --> 31:23.794
I found someone
on the brink of death, but then

31:23.838 --> 31:27.363
his daughter was there,

31:27.407 --> 31:29.626
so I...

31:33.239 --> 31:36.633
I thought I knew
what the right thing to do was.

31:36.677 --> 31:40.246
But Dad was always the one
that I'd talk to about that.

31:40.289 --> 31:43.945
Without him here, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

31:43.989 --> 31:47.949
Just feels like
everything is on pause.

31:47.993 --> 31:52.867
And I'm waiting
for him to wake up.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.783
And I don't know
how long I can handle that.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.004
I can't guarantee

33:00.543 --> 33:02.284
Yet you came alone.

about that fancy toothpick?

how much being a human sucks.

I know it sucks.

34:28.979 --> 34:30.372
It's hard

34:30.416 --> 34:33.245
and disappointing,
and some days you hate it.
