WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:02.470
[Naomi screams]

00:02.503 --> 00:03.971
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:04.004 --> 00:05.439
[gasps]

00:05.473 --> 00:07.975
-[Luke] Is this ever gonna end?
-It's only gonna get worse.

00:08.008 --> 00:11.379
I can let you in
to New Bethlehem.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.980
-What?
-A place where refugees

00:13.013 --> 00:14.315
can get amnesty.

00:14.348 --> 00:18.519
Where one might visit
their grown children.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.621
You're saying I can be
with my daughter?

00:20.654 --> 00:24.225
-[Luke] You trust Lawrence?
-He has been my friend.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.459
-Your friend?
-Yes!

00:25.493 --> 00:28.396
The "architect of Gilead"
is what they call him,

00:28.429 --> 00:29.830
and you just...
You believe him--

00:29.863 --> 00:31.332
You got a package.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.367
-Do you see it?
-Yeah.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.472
I know in my heart
what is best for my child.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.841
That child came from me.
That is my baby.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.645
You're in here, and I'm not.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.746
Here's what you're gonna do.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.880
You're gonna go back in there,

00:46.914 --> 00:48.716
and you are gonna act like
a Handmaid.

00:48.749 --> 00:53.821
But the entire time,
you will be
plotting your revenge.

00:53.854 --> 00:57.758
You cannot help your child
if you're not with them.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.059
[Luke] So what do you think?

00:59.093 --> 01:00.861
You think we can use it
to find Hannah's location?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.163
I hope so.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.331
Give us some time.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.399
[Mark] We found Hannah.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.202
We found her Wives School.
We know where she is.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.303
[June] Mark called.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.139
They're gonna do a raid
of her school,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.273
and they're gonna go get her.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.841
They're gonna bring her
back to us.

01:13.874 --> 01:14.975
[all clamoring excitedly]

01:15.008 --> 01:16.310
I fucking love Mark Tuello!

01:16.344 --> 01:18.612
[Moira] I fucking love
Mark Tuello!

01:34.162 --> 01:35.763
[Mark] Get much sleep
last night?

01:35.796 --> 01:36.697
[June] Hardly any.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.266
Me neither. A lot of details.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.000
[Luke] Where is she?
Where's the school?

01:40.033 --> 01:41.669
Colorado. Colorado Springs.

01:41.702 --> 01:42.736
Near the Mackenzies.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.273
The school's a former
U.S. Air Force academy.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.209
Turns out it was just repurposed
as a Wife School.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.377
Some families there
have identified

01:49.410 --> 01:50.878
the girls to be evacuated.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.713
-So, how many girls?
-Thirty.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.783
Only those who've been stolen
from their parents.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.486
Tonight, our task force will
launch in three aircraft,

01:58.519 --> 02:00.688
literally flying
under Gilead's radar.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.989
That's possible?

02:02.022 --> 02:04.992
Yes. Our sources have confirmed
a small window of opportunity.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.228
A clear flight path
to the school.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.829
Paratroopers will jump
from the first plane,

02:08.862 --> 02:11.365
securing the landing strips
for the other two.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.271
They'll kill anyone
who gets in their way.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.340
Commander.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.442
Luke Bankole, June Osborne.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.711
May I introduce
Commander Elijah Vance?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.379
-Sir.
-It's an honor.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.147
-[Elijah] Ma'am.
-Commander.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.283
We are so grateful.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.219
It's incredible
what you're doing for us.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.820
You've done some pretty
incredible things yourself,

02:32.853 --> 02:33.887
Miss Osborne.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.459
-[Mark] Her daughter is--
-Hannah Bankole.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.494
Goes by Agnes Mackenzie
in Gilead.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.397
Elite unit.
They do their homework.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.099
Commander, the girls...

02:46.133 --> 02:47.435
Um...

02:47.468 --> 02:49.303
When all of this happens,
the girls are gonna just...

02:49.337 --> 02:51.038
-They're gonna be so scared--
-I got a kid of my own

02:51.071 --> 02:52.273
here in Toronto.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.843
Emma. Light of my life.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.080
My plan is to bring
your daughter home

03:00.113 --> 03:01.249
and go home to mine.

03:03.751 --> 03:04.685
Thank you.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.527
I'll be watching their progress
tonight from the consulate.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.963
-[Luke] Watching?
-[Mark] Live feed.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.197
I'll keep you informed.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.966
No. We need to
watch it with you.

03:18.999 --> 03:19.900
Yeah.

03:19.933 --> 03:20.834
[Mark] Uh...

03:20.868 --> 03:21.835
None of the other families--

03:21.869 --> 03:23.737
None of the other families
gave you the intel

03:23.771 --> 03:24.938
to help make this happen.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.444
All right then.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.848
-I'll see what I can do.
-Thank you.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.718
Nice.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.763
[plane flying overhead]

04:32.773 --> 04:34.475
[camera snaps]

04:34.508 --> 04:38.178
[Mrs. Wheeler] Turn him.
This way. A little bit.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.280
Just prop his head up.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.683
There. There. That moment.
There. Did you get that?

04:42.716 --> 04:47.321
-Got it, Mrs. Wheeler. All good.
-Okay. It has to be perfect.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.856
It's going
in the reception area.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.958
It's the first thing
that people will see

04:50.991 --> 04:52.059
when they come to the center.

04:54.261 --> 04:57.631
You know,
that does make me wonder.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.568
Would it be even more effective
if Noah and I were there

05:00.601 --> 05:03.471
to greet our donors
and supporters in person?

05:04.672 --> 05:08.842
-At the fertility center?
-Yes, for the official opening.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.878
And expose him
to all of those people

05:10.911 --> 05:11.912
and all of those germs?

05:11.945 --> 05:15.215
[chuckles] No, no, you're both
gonna stay here.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.250
Well, the Commanders did
send me here

05:17.284 --> 05:18.919
to represent the republic.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.691
But you're our guest
while you're here in Toronto

05:23.724 --> 05:25.926
and you're under
our supervision,

05:25.959 --> 05:30.030
and my husband doesn't answer
to those Commanders.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.465
[Noah crying]

05:32.332 --> 05:33.934
Sounds like someone's hungry.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.538
I can fix that.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.474
You really ought
to start pumping again.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.110
So that he can
bottle-feed on occasion.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.812
I mean,
that was all that he knew

05:44.845 --> 05:47.080
while you were
at the Detention Center.

05:48.982 --> 05:49.883
He must miss it.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.489
It will be
less confusing for him

05:55.523 --> 05:57.491
if he only nurses for now.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.896
Well, my smart boy
won't get confused.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.936
Pump. For next time.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.071
Mrs. Wheeler.

06:19.447 --> 06:24.418
Certainly.
I will pump for next time.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.186
[Noah crying]

06:26.219 --> 06:27.521
Mmm-hmm.

06:30.290 --> 06:33.060
I know.
You miss your bottle.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.563
[Noah continues crying]

06:47.541 --> 06:49.810
-[Lawrence] She's late.
-Two minutes.

06:51.612 --> 06:56.617
Commander, if I may,
you're doing the right thing.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.286
The honorable
and necessary thing

06:59.319 --> 07:01.689
to be a true leader in Gilead.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.526
I appreciate you being here.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.127
I am happy to be of service.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.997
[Martha] Mrs. Putnam's
here, Commander.

07:17.037 --> 07:17.971
Show her in.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.175
[clears throat]

07:24.344 --> 07:26.446
[footsteps approaching]

07:28.148 --> 07:29.583
Blessed day, Commander.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.253
-Aunt Lydia.
-[Aunt Lydia] Mrs. Putnam.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.788
How lovely to see you.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.963
-Tea?
-No, thank you.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.668
But please,
have some yourselves.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.204
I hate tea.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.945
Uh, um...

07:58.345 --> 08:01.314
Mrs... Naomi,

08:01.348 --> 08:05.018
uh, I recognize
that the incident

08:05.052 --> 08:09.356
regarding your late husband
has left you on your own

08:09.389 --> 08:11.692
with a young child
and I've considered

08:11.725 --> 08:13.393
what to do about your future.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.428
Please don't send me
to The Colonies.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.330
Please. I beg you to have mercy.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.732
Heavens, no.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.602
[Lawrence] You're not
responsible for Warren's sins.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.036
Are you kidding? That guy?

08:23.070 --> 08:26.073
You deserve a reward
for putting up with him.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.076
A reward?

08:30.443 --> 08:31.979
In a sense.

08:33.747 --> 08:37.484
Mrs. Putnam, you simply cannot

08:37.517 --> 08:39.620
remain a widow
with a young child

08:39.653 --> 08:42.222
and continue to live
in your house.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.758
Oh.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.894
Of course.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.030
It's much too grand
for two of us.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.066
Maybe a nice condo in Brookline
or Back Bay.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.903
For Pete's sake.
We're not your realtors.

08:55.936 --> 09:00.641
Commander, may I suggest
you convey your intentions?

09:00.674 --> 09:05.278
Right. Okay. So, basically,
it's a quid pro quo.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.584
You need security.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.153
I need to represent
traditional Gilead values.

09:13.186 --> 09:17.124
So you can move in here
with the kid if you want.

09:22.630 --> 09:26.867
As his new Wife and child.
A sacred union, of course.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.704
This is a marriage proposal?

09:30.738 --> 09:34.007
Yep. Yep. So, what do you say?

09:35.643 --> 09:36.910
I have a choice?

09:38.712 --> 09:41.148
That's hurtful.

09:41.181 --> 09:46.820
Mrs. Putnam, a Wife is bound to
her husband as long as he lives.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.957
But if her husband dies,
she is free to marry

09:49.990 --> 09:52.926
whom she chooses.
Only in the Lord.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.696
First Corinthians.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.498
And who doesn't
love Corinthians?

09:58.531 --> 10:00.968
Especially First Corinthians.

10:02.636 --> 10:06.874
Naomi, it's just a suggestion.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.678
Think about it.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.050
I have work to do.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.624
Take some time.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.361
But consider your situation.

10:29.863 --> 10:33.466
His stature, this house.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.969
He had Warren killed
in front of me.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.773
Which he's willing to overlook.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.378
So should you.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.252
May I walk you out?

10:53.453 --> 10:54.387
[Naomi] Yes, please.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.803
[sighs]

12:06.626 --> 12:07.761
Come in.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.739
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.878
-Is there a problem?
-No, no, not at all.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.515
I was just hoping
for a moment with you.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.118
Are you gonna shoot me?

12:33.520 --> 12:34.687
[Mr. Wheeler sighs]

12:34.721 --> 12:36.123
What can I do for you?

12:39.426 --> 12:42.796
I am very grateful
that Ezra is all right.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.700
And for you and Mrs. Wheeler

12:47.734 --> 12:49.602
to welcome me back
into your home

12:49.636 --> 12:52.806
with such kindness
and understanding,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.074
it's a blessing.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.111
Little Noah deserves
a safe space.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.982
[Serena] Yes.
Yes, of course he does.

13:02.015 --> 13:05.085
I know that you're working
on tomorrow's opening.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.256
Gilead could have
used men like you

13:09.289 --> 13:13.060
in the early days
to avoid all those missteps.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.528
Live and learn.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.198
Well, it heartens me
to see how involved you are.

13:18.231 --> 13:23.203
-You truly are Gilead's future.
-I think I'm buttered up.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.939
What's actually on your mind?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.544
The idea to repurpose
the welcome center

13:31.578 --> 13:32.779
into a fertility center.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.982
That was my idea.
I came up with that.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.685
I should be there with Noah,

13:38.718 --> 13:41.955
as a symbol
of a successful pregnancy.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.659
To recruit more followers,
more supporters,

13:46.693 --> 13:48.361
to get women to come in.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.463
Women who want children
of their own.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.734
That was the role
that was intended for me.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.603
That is what I am meant to do.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.076
That's a nice pitch.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.381
I appreciate your passion
for the cause.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.085
I'll consider it.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.291
-Praise be.
-Oh, yeah.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.866
[people chattering indistinctly]

14:26.900 --> 14:28.535
[man 1] Uplink is steady.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.636
[woman 1] 618, holding strong.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.707
Planes are traveling
parallel to the border.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.244
Across near Montana,
then fly due south.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.711
[man 2 over comms] Tiger 1,
confirm position.

14:38.745 --> 14:39.879
[woman 1] Looking into it now.

14:39.913 --> 14:40.813
[pilot over comms]
Vector zero-nine-zero

14:40.847 --> 14:42.149
at 85 miles, 400 knots.

14:42.182 --> 14:46.886
That live feed, it shows
all activity at Hannah's school.

14:48.922 --> 14:49.923
So she's in there?

14:49.957 --> 14:50.924
[woman 1] Signal's good.

14:50.958 --> 14:51.925
[command center]
Tiger 1, altitude.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.726
Right now?

14:53.760 --> 14:56.196
[Mark] We'll see the raid
as it happens.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.767
[command center] Tiger 3,
hang back, maintain visual.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.504
[radio chatter continues]

15:04.537 --> 15:06.139
Maintain visuals on One.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.325
Hey, banana.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.963
[girls] Let our hearts
be devoted to God,

15:29.997 --> 15:34.067
to walk in His statues,
to keep His commandments

15:34.101 --> 15:35.635
as at this day.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.340
May the Lord keep you
and bless you.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.676
[girls] May the Lord keep you
and bless you.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.955
[Aunt Paula] Good night, girls.
Blessed dreams.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.058
[girls] Good night, Aunt Paula.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.137
[people on comms
chattering indistinctly]

16:11.138 --> 16:12.739
[man 1] Maintain visual on 1.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.187
[comms chatter continues]

17:13.266 --> 17:15.402
[comms chatter continues]

17:46.199 --> 17:47.567
You're coming home.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.787
-[operators chatter frantically]
-[computer beeps]

18:11.824 --> 18:13.226
What's happening?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.029
[Mark] Get them out.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.865
-Get them out.
-What's happening?

18:18.898 --> 18:20.032
[Mark] Get them
out of here. Now.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.668
[all clamoring indistinctly]

18:47.827 --> 18:49.229
The girls are safe.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.330
[sighs in relief]

18:51.331 --> 18:53.700
They're still at the school.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.404
It appears our intel was wrong.

18:58.505 --> 19:02.242
Gilead anticipated our mission
and they...

19:03.510 --> 19:05.778
moved their
anti-aircraft systems.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.684
They took all three planes down

19:11.718 --> 19:13.553
as soon as they
crossed the border.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.454
[Luke] What?

19:17.023 --> 19:18.491
There are no survivors.

19:26.266 --> 19:30.169
Sorry. I need to call
the other families.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.214
[phone buzzes]

19:48.855 --> 19:51.258
[buzzing continues]

19:55.762 --> 19:59.299
-Hello.
-[Lawrence] Um, I'm sorry.

19:59.332 --> 20:03.803
June, I really am.
All this bloodshed.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.838
It's exactly
what I was trying to avoid.

20:05.872 --> 20:10.410
All those soldiers are dead.
You fucking slaughtered them.

20:10.443 --> 20:15.248
-They invaded my country.
-To save our children.

20:15.282 --> 20:18.751
-Citizens of Gilead.
-They were stolen from us.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.886
You knew that.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.089
I gave you the chance
to be with Hannah.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.358
You threw your lot in
with the Americans.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.193
Is that why you called?
To blame me?

20:27.226 --> 20:31.364
No. I called because
I want you to know

20:31.398 --> 20:33.266
you can still come
to New Bethlehem.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.234
Why would you let me do that?

20:35.935 --> 20:39.606
Hannah's a symbol now.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.475
And like it or not, so are you.

20:42.509 --> 20:47.113
So after last night,
it would be even more effective

20:47.146 --> 20:51.050
if June Osborne chose
to return to Gilead

20:51.083 --> 20:53.019
to be close to her child.

20:53.052 --> 20:56.323
You can be close to Nick too.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.928
-What do you mean?
-Nick will be there.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.397
You could be neighbors.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.534
You could borrow
cups of sugar from each other,

21:07.567 --> 21:10.036
whatever the kids
are calling it these days.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.540
Do you think that you can
just dangle Nick in front of me

21:13.573 --> 21:15.508
and I'll just do whatever
the fuck you want?

21:15.542 --> 21:18.978
I think it's a good deal
and I think you should take it.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.620
But...

21:30.189 --> 21:31.891
there's this one thing.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.226
Um...

21:34.260 --> 21:36.829
I need you to go public.

21:38.698 --> 21:43.570
Call the failed mission
a foolish act of aggression.

21:44.604 --> 21:48.074
What? No,
I'm not gonna say that.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.476
Why not? It's the truth.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.078
Americans did
what they always do.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.346
They put Hannah...

21:53.380 --> 21:57.249
They put all of those girls
in real danger.

21:57.283 --> 22:02.054
I cannot make Gilead
look like the victim here.

22:02.088 --> 22:08.127
Joseph, this is an...
It is an evil fucking country.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.630
-I can't do that.
-I'm trying to fix it

22:10.663 --> 22:14.133
-from the inside.
-You are still a part of it.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.802
You're one of them.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.940
It's even worse,
'cause I know you know better.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.446
I'm doing what I can.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.716
Step by step
is what I promised Eleanor.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.588
Eleanor hated you.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.060
She couldn't stand
the sight of you.

22:44.063 --> 22:48.501
She was so broken and so...

22:50.202 --> 22:51.671
ashamed.

22:54.507 --> 22:58.511
By the man that she loved.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.016
But she'd rather be dead.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.459
I watched her die.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.931
I did. I watched her die.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.635
And I did nothing.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.171
Nothing.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.846
I knew you had...

23:37.416 --> 23:38.885
something to do with it.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.461
But Eleanor would still want me
to help you with Hannah.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.465
Help come back.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.467
[sobbing] I want her here.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.872
I want my baby here.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.811
Safe...

24:06.946 --> 24:08.014
and free.

24:11.751 --> 24:12.785
Please.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.689
It's never gonna happen.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.097
Then go fuck yourself.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.679
[grunting]

24:45.852 --> 24:46.853
Fuck!

24:58.464 --> 24:59.732
Don't.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.606
[panting]

25:08.107 --> 25:11.110
I know. I know.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.648
-I know.
-Let me go.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.949
It's gonna be okay.

25:18.484 --> 25:21.087
-Please let me go.
-You're gonna be okay.

25:23.556 --> 25:24.757
You're gonna be okay.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.161
You're gonna be okay.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.070
We're gonna get her.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.974
Wait till they see him,
Mrs. Waterford.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.210
So pleased Mr. Wheeler
gave you permission.

25:44.577 --> 25:45.645
Me too.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.151
Blessed day, Mrs. Wheeler.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.187
[grunts]

25:57.089 --> 25:58.658
[gasps]

26:00.693 --> 26:03.830
Stay away from my husband.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.669
Sneaking down all alone
in the middle of the night?

26:09.702 --> 26:12.705
-Mrs. Wheeler, I assure you--
-After I told you no?

26:13.505 --> 26:15.307
Who do you think you are?

26:18.678 --> 26:21.981
I am Mrs. Fredrick Waterford.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.117
To me you're just a whore.

26:30.823 --> 26:31.991
I'm coming with you.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.194
Get in.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.751
[footsteps approaching]

27:16.836 --> 27:18.838
We shouldn't have trusted
those sources.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.810
Gilead was always one step
ahead of us, Mark.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.285
Lawrence called me this morning.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.426
I'm so done
with that son of a bitch.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.498
No doubt they see this
as a victory.

27:46.532 --> 27:47.934
Yeah.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.841
Fuck them. Fuck them, Mark.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.612
You know how
we honor those soldiers?

28:00.646 --> 28:03.049
We do not stop fighting.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.317
No matter what they throw at us,
we don't stop.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.419
Not for one fucking second.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.456
So what's next?

28:14.727 --> 28:15.928
What do we do now?

28:20.733 --> 28:23.035
-So you're done with Lawrence?
-Mmm-hmm.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.738
What about Nick Blaine?

28:28.507 --> 28:29.441
What about him?

28:30.409 --> 28:33.445
I offered to help him
when I was in Gilead,

28:34.646 --> 28:37.283
if he'd help us,
but he turned me down.

28:46.158 --> 28:50.863
What, to be your inside man
in Gilead or something?

28:50.897 --> 28:56.135
At first, but then, eventually,
to be our man here.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.270
With immunity.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.309
He said no?

29:04.743 --> 29:07.179
Yes, but he can still have that.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.482
Maybe you could persuade him.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.423
Nick was an Eye.
He's a Commander now.

29:17.456 --> 29:21.794
Someone like that defecting
from Gilead... Big impact.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.499
You can make one too.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.774
You could. You know that.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.244
After Angels' Flight,
after your testimony

29:38.277 --> 29:40.947
against Waterford,
you should step up.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.149
Put your power to use.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.420
I don't feel comfortable
doing that right now, Mark.

29:51.723 --> 29:52.859
Fair enough.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.428
What about Nick?

29:59.298 --> 30:03.069
I could set up a meeting.
I could set it up today.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.474
Be nice to have a win.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.911
Yeah.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.416
Yeah, set it up.

30:24.991 --> 30:28.160
-Praise the Lord.
-Such a precious miracle.

30:28.194 --> 30:31.330
-So darling. You're so blessed.
-Thank you.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.033
My late husband and I,
God rest his soul,

30:34.066 --> 30:36.435
we tried for many years
to conceive.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.705
There was a lot of heartache
and disappointment.

30:39.738 --> 30:42.041
So I do understand
the yearning for a child.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.709
But Gilead helped a lot.

30:43.742 --> 30:47.213
Clean water, clean air,

30:47.246 --> 30:49.949
scrubbing all of those horrible
toxins out of the environment,

30:49.982 --> 30:53.252
and above all,
a devotion to God.

30:53.285 --> 30:55.387
And living by
the highest of moral standards.

30:55.421 --> 30:58.824
So, you follow Gilead's path
in Toronto,

30:58.857 --> 31:00.192
then perhaps you too

31:00.226 --> 31:03.029
could be blessed
with a child of your own.

31:03.462 --> 31:04.396
Serena?

31:06.598 --> 31:09.201
-WOMAN: Praise be.
-Excuse me.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.006
The Driver will take you home.
You must be exhausted.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.374
I'm doing fine. Thank you.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.944
There's still so many people
here to greet and talk to.

31:17.977 --> 31:21.013
They're not here to see you.
They're here to see Noah.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.715
He is the star attraction.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.052
MRS. WHEELER: Leave Noah
here with us.

31:26.085 --> 31:30.256
Tomorrow, I think
I'll bring Noah by myself,

31:30.289 --> 31:31.991
so you can get some more rest.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.426
That sounds like
a pretty sweet deal to me.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.401
Right. I am quite tired.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.672
I'll just need to nurse him
before I leave.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.008
No need.
We'll just use a bottle.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.377
I didn't bring one.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.114
I told you to always
have one on hand.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.885
I should have packed one,
Mrs. Wheeler.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.955
My mistake.
Just so foolish of me.

32:05.657 --> 32:09.261
Well, just don't take too long.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.564
[chuckles] Think that's
up to little Noah, isn't it?

32:16.835 --> 32:18.670
Thank you for letting me
be a part of today.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.140
I'm very grateful.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.210
There's a nice quiet spot
in the back, Mrs. Waterford.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.111
Thank you.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.659
[Noah crying]

32:41.460 --> 32:43.429
Shh, shh.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.386
Do you mind
if I have some privacy?

33:09.588 --> 33:10.589
Of course.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.231
Thank you so much.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.325
[door beeping]

33:48.894 --> 33:50.629
Please stop. Stop. Stop.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.233
Please. Please.

33:56.202 --> 33:58.137
Please stop. Stop, stop!

34:00.072 --> 34:01.540
[Noah crying]

34:04.443 --> 34:07.446
Please. Please help me
save my son. Please.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.716
-Okay. Get in.
-Thank you.

34:14.986 --> 34:17.689
Thank you, bless you.
Please, just go. Please.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.158
[Noah crying]

35:09.341 --> 35:10.642
Wish you'd said yes.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.647
-To Lawrence's offer?
-Yeah.

35:16.415 --> 35:19.084
Why didn't you say yes to Mark?

35:19.117 --> 35:21.253
He told me.

35:21.287 --> 35:24.055
He said he could still help you
come to Canada.

35:24.089 --> 35:27.193
Why the fuck
didn't you say anything?

35:27.226 --> 35:29.828
-I can't just pick up and leave.
-But you expect me to?

35:31.530 --> 35:36.368
-I'm married now. I have a Wife.
-I have Luke. I have Nichole.

35:36.402 --> 35:40.572
-You can bring Rose with you.
-No. Can't.

35:40.606 --> 35:43.141
Gilead's her home.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.277
Her father's the top Commander.
She's happy there.

35:45.311 --> 35:50.282
Happy? So what happens when
they want you to have a baby?

35:50.316 --> 35:52.884
What happens when they issue you
a Handmaid, and your Wife

35:52.918 --> 35:54.085
has to hold her down
while you--

35:54.119 --> 35:55.587
She's pregnant.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.329
Rose is pregnant.

36:07.866 --> 36:08.734
Oh.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.376
Right.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.715
Gilead's changing.

36:23.749 --> 36:27.853
There's progress under Lawrence.
We're making it better.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.291
"We"?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.662
I have to do whatever it takes
to protect my family,

36:36.695 --> 36:37.863
just like you.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.702
I want what's best
for both our families.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.218
Well, this is
a fine mess, isn't it?

37:01.820 --> 37:03.422
And the world's a mess.

37:10.128 --> 37:12.698
Yeah. You know what
I wish, though?

37:15.567 --> 37:17.703
I wish the world
would just go away.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.740
Just for a little bit.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.681
It's gonna be hard for us
to see each other.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.487
I don't want
to make trouble for you.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.532
Do me a favor and tell Nichole
that I love her.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.037
Tell her I miss her and that
I think about her all the time.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.539
You do that for me?

37:54.440 --> 37:55.574
Of course I will.

38:01.647 --> 38:02.748
I should go.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.585
Enjoy yourself.

38:09.355 --> 38:12.324
Yeah. I haven't seen enough
of my own driver yet.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.293
[chuckles]

38:18.063 --> 38:18.997
I love you.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.773
I love you.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.555
-Hey, Nick?
-Yeah.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.859
Children look to their fathers,
you know.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.029
Set an example.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.668
Rose, I'm so happy for you.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.337
There's no greater gift
than a child.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.372
I know Agnes
has certainly been mine.

39:35.907 --> 39:40.679
Oh, glory be.
You are absolutely glowing.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.648
How lovely.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.216
Blessings upon you
and the Commander, Mrs. Blaine.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.418
[Rose] Thank you, Aunt Lydia.

39:46.452 --> 39:48.454
Aunts are on the guest list now?

39:50.355 --> 39:52.491
Aunt Lydia's here
at the Commander's request.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.994
To be my chaperone.

39:56.027 --> 39:59.731
It is my honor
to accompany you, Mrs. Putnam.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.770
Well, thank the Lord
for such an incredible miracle.

40:04.803 --> 40:08.173
-You and Nick must be thrilled.
-And concerned.

40:09.941 --> 40:14.446
Chance for any genetic issues...
Considering.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.885
We'll leave that in God's hands.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.560
Brothers, the world knows now

40:28.594 --> 40:31.129
that Gilead
will defend its borders

40:32.130 --> 40:33.131
and protect our children.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.602
And the force
and the fury of God,

40:36.635 --> 40:39.204
they kept my dear Agnes
and all the other girls safe.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.607
Praise be.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.876
Not to mention, we've
strengthened our alliances.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.946
The ambassadors from China,
Russia and North Korea

40:47.979 --> 40:50.248
have all congratulated us

40:50.281 --> 40:51.683
for sticking it
to the Americans.

40:51.717 --> 40:54.486
Well, I guess we're playing
with the big boys now.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.987
Yeah, what's the old saying?

40:56.021 --> 40:58.757
"Any club that would have me
as a member..."

41:04.329 --> 41:07.599
Blaine, our troops
are on the move?

41:07.633 --> 41:09.300
Yes, sir.
We'll have two battalions

41:09.334 --> 41:10.536
waiting at the border.

41:10.569 --> 41:11.870
[Commander Mackenzie]
Well, that's excellent.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.139
Canada will think twice
before letting the Americans

41:14.172 --> 41:16.007
use their airspace again.

41:16.041 --> 41:20.111
So all in all, a success.

41:20.145 --> 41:24.683
Well, June Osborne
is still stirring up trouble.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.920
It's about time we fixed
that problem. Don't you agree?

41:34.225 --> 41:39.064
Certainly worth considering.
Shall we, gentlemen?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.778
-[Nick] You okay?
-Now that you're here.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.822
[Commander Mackenzie]
May I take a moment

42:03.855 --> 42:05.891
to thank our gracious host?

42:07.626 --> 42:09.561
Your vision for Gilead's future,

42:09.595 --> 42:12.598
your commitment to our values
and our purpose.

42:14.165 --> 42:17.769
You have impressed, and, well,
surprised me, Commander.

42:22.841 --> 42:28.346
I like to defy expectations.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.781
[Commander Mackenzie]
I'd say you have.

42:31.349 --> 42:32.784
You're truly one of us now.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.320
Praise be.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.256
Praise be.

42:41.627 --> 42:44.395
[Mark] Lieutenant
Miguel Rodriguez.

42:44.429 --> 42:45.597
[protestors shouting
indistinctly]

42:45.631 --> 42:47.633
Ensign Evan Sandler.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.003
Chief Petty Officer Levi Scott.

42:52.037 --> 42:53.905
[female protestor] Get out!
Go home!

42:53.939 --> 42:57.208
Senior Chief Petty Officer
Jill Strickland.

42:57.242 --> 42:58.309
[male protestor] Fuck America!

42:58.343 --> 42:59.911
[female protestor]
They deserved it!

43:01.412 --> 43:03.715
[Mark] Ensign Benjamin Turner.

43:04.750 --> 43:08.186
Petty Officer First Class
Adam Umansky.

43:08.219 --> 43:11.723
-[protestors clamoring]
-[male protestor] Go home!

43:11.757 --> 43:15.694
[Mark] Commander Elijah...
Commander Elijah Vance.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.297
We remember these patriots.

43:20.632 --> 43:23.234
[protestors continue yelling]

43:23.268 --> 43:26.805
Their service. Their courage.

43:29.641 --> 43:30.976
Their sacrifice.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.611
For our country.

43:34.245 --> 43:36.682
[protestors clamoring]

43:38.083 --> 43:40.051
And now, Emma?

43:54.165 --> 43:56.301
I pledge allegiance...

44:02.874 --> 44:06.044
[male protestor] Get the fuck
out of my country!

44:08.714 --> 44:10.782
I pledge...

44:12.684 --> 44:14.319
Can I help?

44:21.626 --> 44:24.896
Hi, Emma. Can I help you?

44:26.264 --> 44:29.367
Say it with me? Okay. Ready?

44:32.137 --> 44:36.041
"I pledge allegiance
to the Flag..."

44:37.275 --> 44:40.846
[both] "Of the United States
of America...

44:42.247 --> 44:46.918
"and to the Republic
for which it stands..."

44:46.952 --> 44:51.923
"One nation under God,
indivisible..."

44:52.657 --> 44:55.393
"With liberty and justice...''

44:55.426 --> 44:57.162
-[gun firing]
-[all screaming]

44:58.696 --> 45:00.999
[gun fires]

45:01.032 --> 45:03.234
[music playing in background]

45:10.208 --> 45:12.410
[gun firing]

45:25.656 --> 45:28.126
