00:58.875 --> 00:59.910
Come in.

01:05.667 --> 01:06.657
Do you like it?

01:07.917 --> 01:08.702
Yes.

01:19.625 --> 01:20.786
Fancy a drink?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.081
Yes... rum.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.748
- Neat?
- Neat.

01:27.917 --> 01:29.499
Where's the bathroom?

01:30.417 --> 01:31.828
Next to the front door.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.164
Okay.

02:04.042 --> 02:04.827
Done.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.536
Here you are.

02:10.917 --> 02:11.827
Thanks.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.039
You know what...?

02:15.333 --> 02:17.370
I really wanted
to get you alone.

02:18.000 --> 02:18.580
Hey!

02:18.750 --> 02:19.990
No screaming,
no funny business!

02:20.583 --> 02:21.744
What are you doing?
Let me go!

02:21.917 --> 02:22.827
What are you doing?

02:24.625 --> 02:25.581
Open the safe.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.073
What?

02:30.333 --> 02:31.789
- I don't have a safe.
- Do it!

02:33.417 --> 02:36.000
- I don't have a safe, okay?
- Please! Please!

02:36.208 --> 02:38.495
You! On your knees.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.786
I'm gonna count to three.

02:43.625 --> 02:44.865
One...

02:48.833 --> 02:50.449
- two...
- Please!

02:50.958 --> 02:52.289
Please!

02:52.500 --> 02:53.080
No!

02:53.292 --> 02:54.498
Please! No!

02:54.917 --> 02:55.998
Stop! 0kaY-

02:56.208 --> 02:56.889
Alright. Alright.

02:57.042 --> 02:57.907
<i>Okay, 0KaY...</i>

02:58.333 --> 02:59.698
lllopeniﬂ

02:59.875 --> 03:00.615
Alright.

03:02.542 --> 03:03.452
Where is it?

03:04.250 --> 03:04.990
Where is it?

03:05.208 --> 03:05.868
Upstairs.

03:12.583 --> 03:13.573
Where have you got it?

03:18.083 --> 03:19.244
Where have you got it?!

03:22.292 --> 03:23.908
Open the fucking safe!

03:24.375 --> 03:26.207
- Open the fucking safe!
- Alright, alright.

03:27.042 --> 03:28.453
Don't you dare get it wrong.

03:35.833 --> 03:37.039
Don't you move.

03:57.875 --> 03:58.706
I'm out of here.

03:58.875 --> 03:59.556
What? No, no, no.

03:59.708 --> 04:00.994
You can't go.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.168
I'm calling the cops.
You're staying as a witness.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.240
I don't even know you!

04:04.417 --> 04:06.579
I came here for a good time
and look at this shit!

04:23.250 --> 04:24.991
Hey!

04:35.083 --> 04:35.823
How did it go?

04:36.167 --> 04:36.827
Sweet.

04:39.667 --> 04:40.623
Hey!

04:40.792 --> 04:41.702
Motherfuckers!

05:44.625 --> 05:46.707
So you'll always take me with you.

05:55.708 --> 05:57.745
No, no, no. Not now.

06:00.083 --> 06:02.541
One more score
and we're gone for good.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.823
Promise me.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.494
I promise.

06:43.583 --> 06:45.449
It's a jewelry store downtown.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.328
The owner, Julia Camacho,

06:47.500 --> 06:49.332
inherited her parents' business.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.491
They both died in a robbery
two years ago.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.412
Since then, the store
has been connected to the home.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.161
It's right above it.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.828
This is the target.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.749
His name is Mikel Gémez.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.533
From a swank family
fallen on hard times.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.620
He just moved in with her
and they're getting married.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.620
Just get them
to open the door for you.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.370
Then we can get into
the jewelry store.

07:13.958 --> 07:15.619
Is it all set
with your catering guy?

07:16.333 --> 07:17.573
Sure, as usual.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.332
We find out everything
before we go in.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.490
I don't like it.

07:24.458 --> 07:25.289
Why?

07:26.708 --> 07:28.449
Just because.
Burgling a house is one thing,

07:28.583 --> 07:30.144
getting into a jewelry store
is another.

07:30.292 --> 07:31.874
If something goes wrong,
we're trapped.

07:32.042 --> 07:33.407
Nothing will go wrong.

07:35.708 --> 07:38.166
We only need this job to get
the cash to take off to Lisbon.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.037
I just mean we've got
the cops on our heels.

07:41.583 --> 07:42.948
Maybe it's time to stop,

07:43.167 --> 07:44.908
split what we've got and disappear.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.249
If I win in Lisbon
we'll make one million.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.282
You have to win first.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.494
You know I will.

07:52.833 --> 07:53.948
You'd better.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.661
Shall I help you tidy up?

08:17.833 --> 08:20.700
No, but you could help me
make room for all this.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.416
So where do I fit in
in all this stuff?

08:23.875 --> 08:25.991
- Are you calling me anal?
- A little.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.323
Come here.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.255
You've no idea how much
I wanted you to move in.

08:34.332 --> 08:35.414
Me too.

08:35.542 --> 08:37.783
And you played hard to get.

08:37.957 --> 08:40.871
- You have to do the right thing.
- You've got a nerve.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.286
- Are you happy?
- Ecstatic.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.411
You're the perfect couple.

08:58.542 --> 08:59.748
Hey there.

09:00.833 --> 09:01.538
How are you?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.699
Fine, hoping you'd pay us a visit.

09:03.875 --> 09:04.785
No, no, no.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.574
I don't want to bother you yet.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.492
Besides, I'm a bit jealous.
You're taking my soul mate.

09:09.667 --> 09:10.748
So take care of her for me.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.956
Carla, you're never a bother,

09:12.167 --> 09:14.249
and the guest room is always yours,
you know that.

09:14.708 --> 09:15.708
I'll take you up on that.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.039
Do it.

10:11.542 --> 10:12.532
Got a light?

10:15.083 --> 10:16.244
Sure.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.995
Nice car.

10:36.042 --> 10:38.249
- Very fancy.
- Thanks.

10:38.417 --> 10:39.327
You want some?

10:39.500 --> 10:40.911
Thanks. I don't smoke dope.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.448
No, you're a secret smoker.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.199
I wasn't smoking in secret.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.157
Alright then.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.790
How can you work
and smoke this stuff?

10:59.958 --> 11:02.165
I couldn't handle
those lame-asses straight.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.324
Whatever happened to
booze binges on the beach?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.457
And it's kind of a mixed party.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.699
Yes, well, my fiancée's
a bit traditional.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.248
So, you get a hit?

11:17.375 --> 11:18.490
No.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.911
Do you want to play a game?

11:23.833 --> 11:24.823
Yes.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.498
Close your eyes.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.536
Open your mouth.

11:46.208 --> 11:47.323
What are you doing?

11:49.292 --> 11:51.784
Just checking if
you're one of the good guys.

11:56.417 --> 11:58.328
It turns out you are.
Sorry.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.207
Wait... Wait.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.874
So you're not one
of the good guys after all.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.331
Look...

12:12.250 --> 12:13.991
I'll be there on Thursday.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.457
If you want to stop by...

12:18.667 --> 12:20.533
I'm going inside, okay?

12:22.583 --> 12:23.288
Ciao.

12:54.750 --> 12:55.865
Vodka!

12:58.458 --> 12:59.869
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.328
Welcome to your bachelor party.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.036
Maybe I shouldn't be here...

13:09.208 --> 13:10.994
Maybe it's the dress.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.915
It's a bit over the top. Sorry.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.414
No, on the contrary.

13:14.542 --> 13:15.577
You look stunning.

13:18.042 --> 13:20.079
- I'll get this.
- No, no, I will.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.489
What kind of bachelor party is it
if the groom has to pay?

13:24.083 --> 13:25.164
Do you want to sit down?

13:25.333 --> 13:26.414
Yeah, sure.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.957
I don't even know your name.

13:29.917 --> 13:30.952
Ari.

13:32.625 --> 13:33.535
I'm Mikel...

13:33.875 --> 13:34.706
I know.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.529
Tell me something about yourself.

14:00.375 --> 14:01.536
What do you want to know?

14:01.917 --> 14:03.248
Got a boyfriend?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.082
Do you want me to, or not?

14:07.292 --> 14:08.908
Actually, I'll take the truth.

14:17.292 --> 14:18.077
Shit.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.920
Sorry if I annoyed you.
Let's change the subject.

14:21.833 --> 14:22.948
Let's go, please.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.073
Where to?

14:26.667 --> 14:27.788
I don't know, let's just go.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.288
Let's go.

14:49.208 --> 14:49.913
Hey!

14:50.333 --> 14:51.664
That's the chick that robbed me.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.786
- Did you come by car?
- Yes.

14:57.542 --> 14:58.748
- Where is it?
- Over there.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.289
That car. Let's go!

15:11.292 --> 15:12.032
Let's go!

15:36.958 --> 15:37.718
What are you doing?

15:37.875 --> 15:39.036
It's red, can't you see?

15:39.417 --> 15:40.452
Go that way!

15:40.875 --> 15:41.990
- Come on!
- No.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.073
Shit.

15:46.292 --> 15:47.327
Wait.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.244
So who was that?

16:42.792 --> 16:44.783
Some jerk I owe money to.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.287
Where'd you learn
to drive like that?

16:51.083 --> 16:52.994
There's a lot
you don't know about me.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.031
I'll get out here.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.867
Here? This is
the middle of nowhere.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.202
Well...

17:12.750 --> 17:14.286
It'll be a nice quiet stroll.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.665
I could use some fresh air.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.156
Okay.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.323
Was I so bad?

18:08.458 --> 18:09.573
Quite the opposite.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.491
I just gave you my number

18:14.917 --> 18:16.453
in case you want to
call me sometime,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.458
to hang out and talk for a bit.

18:23.625 --> 18:24.911
You're incredible.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.492
And I wouldn't want to
hang out just for a bit.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.374
It's been a pleasure.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.331
Same here.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.706
He had some wild moves.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.161
Where'd this guy come from?

19:34.333 --> 19:35.664
No idea.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.699
But he sure can drive,
and he's tough.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.328
You're not losing your cool?

19:42.667 --> 19:44.328
I've got it all under control.

21:19.167 --> 21:20.953
I overslept.

21:22.042 --> 21:23.703
Why didn't you wake me?

21:25.750 --> 21:27.161
I felt bad for you.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.745
And I was starting to think
I was marrying a robot.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.749
Sorry,
I was out late with Alfredo,

21:34.917 --> 21:37.079
you know, bachelor party stuff.

21:37.542 --> 21:38.452
Well...

21:39.042 --> 21:40.373
you could've called.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.290
Yes, you're right.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.448
Did you get in very late?

21:45.917 --> 21:46.873
A little,

21:48.833 --> 21:51.200
that's why I didn't want to wake you.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.956
- That him?
- Yes.

23:15.292 --> 23:16.248
So...

23:17.458 --> 23:18.744
Sunday morning.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.706
We'll be ready.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.082
Good, good work.

23:51.083 --> 23:51.788
Hello.

23:52.708 --> 23:53.698
Good morning.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.990
You're an early bird, aren't you?

23:57.208 --> 23:57.993
Yes.

23:58.458 --> 23:59.738
Where are we going at this hour?

23:59.750 --> 24:00.785
It's a surprise.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.540
Are you afraid of heights?

24:03.333 --> 24:04.038
No.

24:04.417 --> 24:05.828
Then you're going to love it.

25:49.792 --> 25:50.657
I loved it.

25:50.833 --> 25:51.823
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.205
That's great.

25:53.375 --> 25:54.786
I haven't been here in ages.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.073
Is this your secret hiding place?

25:58.625 --> 25:59.831
I don't hide.

26:01.583 --> 26:02.493
So what else?

26:02.667 --> 26:03.748
What else what?

26:04.042 --> 26:05.163
What else do you want to do?

26:05.208 --> 26:05.868
Well...

26:06.042 --> 26:07.908
Are you hungry?
Shall we grab a bite?

26:08.250 --> 26:10.708
Sure, I'm starving.
But let's go somewhere quiet.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.491
Okay.
How about my place?

26:17.250 --> 26:18.411
Are you sure?

26:18.958 --> 26:20.619
Yes. We're friends, right?

26:21.083 --> 26:22.539
Girls don't buy that

26:22.708 --> 26:24.369
from boyfriends,
just so you know.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.491
Don't worry.
My fiancée won't be at home.

26:28.667 --> 26:29.828
Shall we go?

26:57.500 --> 26:59.992
This guy is
full of fucking surprises.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.331
Damn right.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.911
Dude, this isn't the jewelry store.

27:36.083 --> 27:37.448
I know.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.032
So what do we do?

27:39.500 --> 27:40.490
Do we go see what's up?

27:40.750 --> 27:41.990
Maybe she's in trouble.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.911
Go to the garage,
I'll stay and wait for her.

27:47.875 --> 27:48.785
Whatever you say.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.289
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

28:06.292 --> 28:07.908
I didn't picture it like this.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.741
This is where I live before.

28:21.375 --> 28:22.786
Are you alright?

28:25.167 --> 28:27.283
Maybe this is a bit awkward.

28:28.167 --> 28:29.453
I'll take you home if you like.

28:55.458 --> 28:56.493
What's this?

28:57.667 --> 28:58.702
I had an accident.

28:59.625 --> 29:00.740
A flying accident?

29:01.958 --> 29:03.414
Yeah, kind of.

29:08.167 --> 29:09.498
No, no. Sorry, sorry.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.078
I can't. Sorry, I have to go.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.874
No, I'm sorry. I asked you over
for lunch and suddenly...

29:13.042 --> 29:14.953
Really, it's fine, but I have to go.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.453
I really have to go.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.288
- I'll take you.
- There's no need, really. I'm going.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.536
- Will I see you again?
- We'll talk.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.957
You knew that wasn't the place.
What took you so long?

29:55.417 --> 29:57.328
It was hard to get away.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.230
I didn't want him
to suspect anything.

30:01.250 --> 30:01.990
Right.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.203
You've got him in the bag.

30:05.417 --> 30:07.033
We'll keep trying
until he falls for it.

30:07.417 --> 30:08.532
I don't want to.

30:09.583 --> 30:10.698
- Excuse me?
- I don't want to do it.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.537
You want me to screw him until
he takes me to his fiancée's place?

30:14.750 --> 30:15.911
Is that what you want?

30:16.833 --> 30:18.198
Go fuck yourself.

30:23.625 --> 30:24.660
And why's that?

30:24.833 --> 30:27.165
It was a shitty bachelor pad,
for him alone.

30:27.333 --> 30:29.290
You think he'll ever take me
to his girl's house?

30:29.458 --> 30:30.072
No!

30:30.292 --> 30:31.623
It's a waste of time.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.490
Navas, I'm sick of all this.

30:35.083 --> 30:35.948
I'm sick of it.

30:37.292 --> 30:38.157
Let's leave.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.490
Please, let's go.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.452
Okay.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.911
We'll forget about him,

30:48.292 --> 30:49.373
but we'll find a new one...

30:49.500 --> 30:50.490
the last one.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.410
The last one?

31:26.958 --> 31:28.369
You can't sleep either?

31:30.750 --> 31:32.616
I've been having
nightmares all night...

31:33.625 --> 31:34.831
about my parents.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.867
Julia, don't dwell on it.

31:38.042 --> 31:40.659
- It won't happen to you.
- Of course not, but...

31:41.333 --> 31:44.075
living in this place,

31:44.583 --> 31:46.494
over the same store where...

31:47.292 --> 31:48.202
Anyway...

31:50.417 --> 31:52.909
Promise you'll always be here
to protect me?

31:54.792 --> 31:56.248
Of course.

32:25.625 --> 32:26.365
<i>Ari?</i>

32:27.333 --> 32:28.213
<i>Ar/', can you hear me?</i>

32:28.292 --> 32:29.202
Hello.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.285
How are you?

32:32.042 --> 32:32.873
Fine.

32:33.042 --> 32:33.873
What about you?

32:35.250 --> 32:35.990
Fine.

32:37.750 --> 32:38.615
What do you want?

32:41.958 --> 32:42.948
I want to see you.

32:43.833 --> 32:44.948
<i>Can we meet up?</i>

32:48.208 --> 32:49.494
Yes.

32:52.375 --> 32:53.581
My place okay?

32:56.958 --> 32:57.948
L\ \ \ \ 30 \\

32:58.625 --> 32:59.615
Great.

33:00.292 --> 33:01.248
See you soon.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.865
We've got the architect.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.366
We did some research at it,
looks okay.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.411
The party's in two weeks.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.831
That's cutting it fine.

33:27.625 --> 33:29.741
I don't get why we gave up
on the jewelry guy.

33:30.750 --> 33:31.785
It didn't work out.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.660
We'll go ahead with this guy.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.499
Talk to your man
and focus on the car.

33:36.667 --> 33:37.498
Alright.

34:26.958 --> 34:27.822
Your hair...?

34:28.167 --> 34:29.498
Don't ask.

34:30.500 --> 34:31.489
Don't say a word.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.286
I was climbing the walls.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.158
I can't get you out of my head.

36:34.958 --> 36:35.914
Who are you?

36:40.333 --> 36:41.789
What are you hiding from?

36:42.167 --> 36:43.703
You're much prettier like that.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.494
I'm not hiding.

36:46.708 --> 36:47.869
I'm right here.

36:54.208 --> 36:55.369
What's your dream?

37:02.625 --> 37:05.367
I'd kill to live somewhere
like Punta del Este.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.242
Unspoiled beaches,
just doing my thing...

37:14.375 --> 37:15.331
Let's go then.

37:18.458 --> 37:19.573
Let's go.

37:20.458 --> 37:21.789
To Punta del Este,

37:21.958 --> 37:23.414
or wherever you want.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.324
What are you talking about?

37:27.583 --> 37:28.948
You don't think I'd do it?

37:30.417 --> 37:31.748
Are you kidding me?

37:36.167 --> 37:37.373
You asshole.

37:51.667 --> 37:54.034
I know it seems I always rush off,
but I really have to go.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.865
Don't worry, honey.

38:16.042 --> 38:17.908
It's only natural that
he's scared about the wedding.

38:18.083 --> 38:19.619
He could have told me though.

38:19.792 --> 38:22.830
The engagement dinner was
his idea, not mine.

38:23.000 --> 38:23.705
Sure.

38:23.875 --> 38:24.865
He's nervous.

38:25.042 --> 38:26.624
His life has done
a U-turn for you.

38:26.792 --> 38:27.782
You have to understand.

38:27.958 --> 38:28.868
You think so?

38:30.583 --> 38:31.789
I don't know.

38:32.375 --> 38:33.581
Sometimes I think

38:33.750 --> 38:36.162
I'm trying to turn him
into something he's not.

38:37.167 --> 38:38.874
Julia, he adores you.

38:39.417 --> 38:40.657
That's all that matters.

38:41.292 --> 38:41.997
Right.

38:42.625 --> 38:44.241
If he adores me so much,

38:44.583 --> 38:45.618
why isn't he here?

40:47.833 --> 40:48.823
Good luck.

41:29.750 --> 41:30.660
Fuck!

42:43.875 --> 42:46.993
Navitas, where were you?
Come here!

42:56.958 --> 42:58.448
When are you going to race for me?

42:58.583 --> 42:59.493
Not gonna happen.

42:59.792 --> 43:00.702
I'm on my own.

43:01.750 --> 43:02.911
Then race against me.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.286
Just you and me.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.789
One race.

43:07.625 --> 43:09.161
For real money.

43:12.958 --> 43:13.823
Alright.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.035
Whenever you want.

43:51.333 --> 43:52.368
Julia!

44:13.042 --> 44:14.248
Julia...

44:16.250 --> 44:17.661
Honey, I'm sorry.

44:17.833 --> 44:20.495
I totally forgot.
I'm really sorry.

44:22.458 --> 44:25.780
I was up late with Alfredo
and stayed at his place.

44:25.958 --> 44:29.622
That's odd. We spoke to Alfredo
last night. He was with his girl.

44:30.458 --> 44:31.789
I'm going.

44:35.500 --> 44:36.831
I can explain.

44:38.625 --> 44:39.911
Then explain.

44:41.500 --> 44:42.490
Right...

44:43.625 --> 44:45.332
I was flying till late.

44:46.375 --> 44:49.208
Then I stayed at the airfield,
just thinking, and...

44:50.375 --> 44:52.582
I needed some time to myself.

44:53.958 --> 44:55.289
I don't get it.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.786
Yesterday was our engagement dinner.

44:58.500 --> 44:59.740
Yes, I know.

45:00.750 --> 45:02.036
I'll make it up for you.

45:02.250 --> 45:04.457
I called you 20 times. 20!

45:05.292 --> 45:06.812
Can you tell me why
you didn't pick up?

45:06.958 --> 45:08.369
My battery ran out.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.081
Fine.

45:14.625 --> 45:17.242
You disappear at night,
you lie to me...

45:17.500 --> 45:19.662
and now you tell me
you need to be alone.

45:20.542 --> 45:22.078
What the hell's wrong with you?

45:23.958 --> 45:24.914
I don't know.

45:26.625 --> 45:28.457
Do me a favor
and make up your mind.

46:16.333 --> 46:17.073
Hello.

46:18.292 --> 46:19.077
Hello.

46:20.833 --> 46:21.793
What are you doing here?

46:22.083 --> 46:23.039
I wanted to see you.

46:24.417 --> 46:25.623
Hey, stop, stop.

46:25.792 --> 46:26.953
What's your game?

46:27.958 --> 46:29.574
When did you decide
that I owe you an explanation?

46:29.750 --> 46:31.991
We've a few fucking nice days,
then you vanish...

46:32.208 --> 46:33.369
Come on, cut it out.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.535
Ari.

46:36.083 --> 46:36.743
Hello.

46:38.208 --> 46:40.449
- Am I interrupting?
- No, it's nothing, honey.

46:41.583 --> 46:43.449
You look familiar.
Customer or friend?

46:43.583 --> 46:45.290
- Friend.
- Friend.

46:46.792 --> 46:48.908
You're Escribano, the driver, right?

46:50.500 --> 46:52.491
Not anymore.

46:53.208 --> 46:55.245
Formula GT's shattered hope.

46:55.625 --> 46:57.992
An accident took you
off the track in 2010.

46:58.208 --> 46:59.073
That's right,

46:59.292 --> 47:00.578
I can't compete anymore.

47:01.708 --> 47:02.664
Too bad.

47:03.292 --> 47:04.327
I'm Navas.

47:04.500 --> 47:05.331
Mikel.

47:05.833 --> 47:06.573
Right.

47:06.750 --> 47:07.785
If you need something
from the garage...

47:07.958 --> 47:08.743
No.

47:09.167 --> 47:10.202
It's okay.

47:10.625 --> 47:11.581
Nice to meet you.

47:40.958 --> 47:42.164
Nice ride.

47:42.333 --> 47:43.915
500 horsepower, all-wheel-drive...

47:45.458 --> 47:46.539
Can I hear it?

47:58.625 --> 47:59.581
Hit it.

48:13.917 --> 48:15.282
I'll buy you a beer.

48:16.625 --> 48:17.660
Let's go.

48:34.542 --> 48:36.704
Wait inside,
I'll be right there.

48:43.417 --> 48:45.875
- What the hell are you doing?
- I want to see how he rolls.

48:46.250 --> 48:48.662
If he's not into you,
he's come a long way to find you.

48:48.833 --> 48:50.415
Get this into your head:

48:50.542 --> 48:52.874
Mikel's in love with his fiancée,
he's going to marry her.

48:53.083 --> 48:55.290
Maybe he wants to fuck me,
I won't deny that,

48:55.458 --> 48:56.698
but he'll never take me
to his girl's place.

48:56.875 --> 48:58.866
Not you,
but a good buddy, maybe.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.160
Everything alright?

49:23.625 --> 49:24.581
Fine.

49:25.500 --> 49:28.788
She gets jealous when I hang out
with her friends.

49:29.458 --> 49:30.823
Couple of beers here.

49:34.708 --> 49:36.790
You really like her don't you? Ari.

49:39.042 --> 49:41.704
I'm not sure I feel comfortable
talking to you about it.

49:41.958 --> 49:42.993
Why?

49:43.417 --> 49:45.328
Ari and I have been friends for years.

49:47.083 --> 49:48.369
Like brother and sister.

49:50.375 --> 49:52.958
So how does it work?
If you approve, I can call her?

49:59.375 --> 50:01.082
You don't have
much of a chance with Ari.

50:01.917 --> 50:02.748
No?

50:02.917 --> 50:03.782
You bet...

50:04.250 --> 50:05.206
Why's that?

50:05.792 --> 50:07.749
She's into another type of guy.

50:08.375 --> 50:09.661
Daredevils.

50:11.083 --> 50:12.414
Daredevils...

50:14.000 --> 50:15.240
Daring to do what?

50:15.625 --> 50:17.241
Guys that dare to race.

50:17.958 --> 50:19.369
Guys that dare to live.

50:20.167 --> 50:22.204
What makes you think
I'm not one of them?

50:23.417 --> 50:24.498
I don't know.

50:24.917 --> 50:25.873
Are you?

50:38.458 --> 50:39.823
Right, what is there to do?

50:40.292 --> 50:42.499
We let the train pass,
and when I say, you step on it.

50:42.625 --> 50:45.306
We beat it to the level crossing,
then cut across to the other side.

50:47.167 --> 50:48.077
You're crazy.

50:48.375 --> 50:50.412
I'll do it if you want.
You can be my passenger.

50:52.833 --> 50:56.030
It's some people's place in life,
and that's cool.

50:57.458 --> 50:58.823
It's cool, Mikel.

51:03.333 --> 51:04.243
Let's go.

51:18.833 --> 51:20.449
It's down to one second.

51:23.917 --> 51:26.750
In one second you can brake
and slam us against the wall.

51:26.917 --> 51:29.204
Or you can hesitate
and let the train take us.

51:29.917 --> 51:32.625
Or you can step on it all the way
and reach the other side.

51:34.375 --> 51:35.035
Ready?

51:37.375 --> 51:39.036
- Now?
- I'll let you know.

51:43.083 --> 51:43.788
Now?

51:56.250 --> 51:56.910
- Now?
- Now!

52:10.667 --> 52:12.283
This is your fucking second, Mikel!

52:25.500 --> 52:26.080
Yes!

52:26.917 --> 52:27.952
God!

52:28.167 --> 52:28.998
That's the shit!

52:33.000 --> 52:34.365
So, you wanna race again?

52:38.292 --> 52:39.327
Yes.

52:39.833 --> 52:40.493
Yes.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.662
Nano! This is Mikel.
He's racing with us tomorrow.

52:59.833 --> 53:00.664
Well, we'll see.

53:00.917 --> 53:01.873
We'll see.

53:04.458 --> 53:05.493
How's it lookin'?

53:06.958 --> 53:08.198
The upholstery could go.

53:08.958 --> 53:10.869
We definitely have to
adjust the locks.

53:11.042 --> 53:12.658
And unplug some of the electronics.

53:13.417 --> 53:15.875
- Good. Charge him as a friend, yo?
- Sure.

53:17.917 --> 53:19.453
You ready to race again?

53:20.292 --> 53:21.578
I hope so.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.537
Are you going to chicken out now?

53:27.167 --> 53:28.282
Thanks.

53:51.625 --> 53:52.865
2,000 to Navas.

53:54.542 --> 53:55.703
Now we're all here.

53:55.875 --> 53:56.990
May the best man win.

56:00.833 --> 56:01.664
Come on, get off.

56:01.958 --> 56:03.244
You wanna leave the car here?

56:03.417 --> 56:04.498
It's too risky,
we'll run for it.

56:04.667 --> 56:07.034
- How do we get it later?
- We can come back.

56:41.542 --> 56:42.247
Shit!

56:42.417 --> 56:43.498
- Relax! Relax!
- Shit!

56:43.625 --> 56:44.410
Think about it!

56:44.625 --> 56:45.706
What could happen, a fine?

56:45.875 --> 56:47.036
I can't get busted, Mikel.

56:47.250 --> 56:47.955
Why not?

56:48.167 --> 56:49.623
I can't get busted,
end of story!

56:52.458 --> 56:53.493
Go, I'll lift you.

56:54.250 --> 56:55.081
Then nobody can pull you up.

56:55.292 --> 56:56.828
I fucking know that!
Come on!

56:57.042 --> 56:57.782
Let's go!

57:06.417 --> 57:07.623
Show me your hands!

57:10.792 --> 57:12.157
Now get down!

57:13.083 --> 57:14.949
- Make it fast!
- Relax!

57:23.167 --> 57:24.032
Do you know...

57:24.333 --> 57:25.915
the girl in the blond wig?

57:27.375 --> 57:27.989
No.

57:29.708 --> 57:31.619
Look at her, it's important.

57:34.208 --> 57:36.165
Really, like I said, no.

57:41.292 --> 57:42.032
So...

57:42.250 --> 57:43.081
Let's see...

57:43.417 --> 57:45.283
I was only racing.

57:45.458 --> 57:48.530
I ran when I saw the patrol cars
because I was scared.

57:48.708 --> 57:50.244
I'm not involved in all of this.

57:50.708 --> 57:51.823
"All of this“?

57:52.292 --> 57:55.660
What does that mean?
Do you know what we're looking for?

57:56.042 --> 57:57.032
Look...

57:58.250 --> 58:00.570
I don't know anybody from the race,
least of all that girl.

58:00.708 --> 58:02.290
I've never seen her before.

58:02.458 --> 58:03.744
You don't know anyone?

58:04.458 --> 58:06.995
You only get in a race like this
by invitation.

58:07.708 --> 58:08.948
Who invited you?

58:10.833 --> 58:11.789
I don't know his name.

58:11.958 --> 58:13.915
I met him through a customer.
We started talking about cars...

58:14.083 --> 58:15.369
At the jewelry store?

58:17.583 --> 58:18.448
Yes.

58:21.458 --> 58:22.744
Is he one of these men?

58:30.333 --> 58:31.323
No.

58:31.500 --> 58:32.865
It's a gang of thieves.

58:33.042 --> 58:35.830
They use the girl as bait
to get into the houses.

58:36.375 --> 58:38.457
We've been after them
for some time.

58:39.083 --> 58:41.199
Do you get it?

58:43.333 --> 58:44.289
No.

58:46.833 --> 58:48.323
I'm sorry,
but I can't help you.

58:49.542 --> 58:50.282
Very well.

58:51.500 --> 58:54.743
If they contact you
or if you change your mind,

58:57.792 --> 58:59.499
call me, that's my number.

59:04.292 --> 59:07.205
I didn't want to worry you, Julia,
that's all.

59:08.458 --> 59:11.576
You said you'd quit for good,
that you'd never race again.

59:12.458 --> 59:14.199
And to top it off, illegal races.

59:17.292 --> 59:19.408
I'm having a rough time, that's all.

59:20.708 --> 59:21.994
Who is she?

59:22.875 --> 59:23.831
Nobody.

59:24.917 --> 59:26.578
This is because of the wedding.

59:27.333 --> 59:28.038
Is that it?

59:28.333 --> 59:31.655
You're scared, so you bang
the first bitch you come across.

59:32.458 --> 59:33.619
Or is it serious?

59:33.792 --> 59:34.702
What are you saying?

59:34.875 --> 59:36.457
If that's not it,
then tell me what's wrong.

59:36.583 --> 59:38.343
A person doesn't change
completely overnight.

59:38.458 --> 59:40.699
Maybe now I'm who
I really want to be.

59:41.500 --> 59:42.865
What's that supposed to mean?

59:43.042 --> 59:45.955
It's not only the wedding,
it's everything, this life...

59:46.708 --> 59:48.290
Julia, we got here out of habit.

59:48.750 --> 59:49.740
Habit?

59:49.917 --> 59:51.328
Habit, Julia, habit.

59:51.667 --> 59:53.032
We decided to get married
cause we were supposed to...

59:53.250 --> 59:54.866
Who is she, Mikel?
Do I know her?

59:56.333 --> 59:57.573
Do I know her?!

01:00:01.542 --> 01:00:03.158
No, you don't know her.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.037
You must admit that if we split up,
you'd be relieved.

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:08.453
Do you mean...

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.412
you're breaking up with me
as a favor?

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.536
I really need this.

01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:16.828
I need to getaway,
from the wedding, the store, you...

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:19.037
Then why did you let us
go this far, damn it?

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:22.907
Get out of my house.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.490
Go!

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.164
And leave the key.

01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:37.615
Mikel.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.661
I wasn't with you out of habit.

01:00:42.583 --> 01:00:44.244
It was out of love.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:22.581
Fuck!

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.582
Let's just stick to the plan!

01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:26.073
Nano, don't go on about it.

01:01:26.708 --> 01:01:29.416
You let him find the garage!
You let him race!

01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:30.996
It couldn't be more perfect!

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.911
I don't get it!
I really don't!

01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:34.539
I don't get it either.

01:01:36.958 --> 01:01:38.638
How many suckers like me
have you taken in?

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.741
- Easy, man.
- Fuck easy!

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:42.706
What the fuck is this about?
My car?

01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:44.161
Julia's store?
Or did you want everything?

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.414
What did you tell them?

01:01:45.542 --> 01:01:47.462
What the fuck can I say
if I don't know anything?

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:52.243
It's true,

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.283
we were after your money.

01:01:57.417 --> 01:01:58.407
Fine.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:01:59.910
Now what?

01:02:00.208 --> 01:02:02.870
Nothing. You know everything,
so we forget about your money.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.740
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:06.624
Fuck, Navas,
he just came from the cops.

01:02:06.917 --> 01:02:07.907
Relax.

01:02:08.917 --> 01:02:10.499
Nothing to say?

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:13.786
What do you want me to say?

01:02:16.708 --> 01:02:18.164
It is what it is.

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:22.199
You better wise up, Escribano.

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.411
Mikel.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.661
Now you're one of us.

01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.244
Don't screw us over.

01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:50.452
Navas...

01:02:50.792 --> 01:02:52.203
We can't let him go
just like that.

01:02:52.375 --> 01:02:53.957
He could fuck us up big-time.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.536
Open the door for him, Nano.

01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:25.948
What are you doing here?

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:28.578
Nothing, man. Relax.

01:04:29.167 --> 01:04:30.828
Ari's downstairs.
We want to sort this out

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.536
like civilized human beings.

01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:34.661
Civilized human beings...

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:38.500
I'm not going to give you away,
but please leave me alone.

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:40.707
I know that, and we owe you.

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:43.619
All this has been
a bad smash-up.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.241
You manned up for me.

01:04:49.292 --> 01:04:51.172
Why don't you come along?
We'll forget about it.

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:53.994
There's nothing to forget.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:56.290
Ari's with you,
that's pretty clear, right?

01:04:56.458 --> 01:04:58.665
That doesn't mean
she doesn't want to see you again.

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.786
There's a party in the suburbs.

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:04.198
Why don't you come along?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.286
You don't give up, do you?

01:05:11.042 --> 01:05:12.077
Never.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.331
I'll go get changed.

01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:32.874
I didn't think you were coming.

01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:35.579
Your boy can be persuasive.

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:39.833
- We're gonna have a blast tonight.
- Let's go.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:01.164
Are you alright?

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:02.581
How do you do it?

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.786
You really want to know?

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.956
See that girl?

01:07:32.292 --> 01:07:34.909
She's got a Lexus convertible
parked out front.

01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:36.494
The keys are in her bag.

01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:39.245
Grab them and take the car.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.535
I'll wait outside.

01:09:44.167 --> 01:09:45.908
So this is how it feels?

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:47.331
Cool, huh?

01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:51.038
Are you okay?

01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:52.698
I'm in heaven.

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:58.290
Fuck, you're so hot, Ari.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.706
Cut it out, Navas.

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.408
You're kinda wasted.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.535
Yeah?

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:36.664
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:38.618
Where are you?

01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:39.953
<i>That's none of your business.</i>

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:41.786
You stole that car.

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:43.786
<i>They saw you at the party,
and they're looking for it.</i>

01:11:43.958 --> 01:11:46.245
Hold on,
what are you talking about?

01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:47.782
So don't bother us anymore.

01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:50.539
Is that clear, Escribano?

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.911
- Yes.
- Good.

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:01.245
Now he won't come back
to the garage,

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:02.748
or even think about
talking to the cops.

01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:04.203
You're a bastard.

01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:05.789
Why didn't you tell me.

01:12:05.958 --> 01:12:07.073
You wouldn't have come.

01:12:07.292 --> 01:12:08.453
What do you know?

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:10.286
Don't you trust rne now?

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:12.039
You tell me.

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:13.664
Can I trust you?

01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:44.990
What's going on, Navas?

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:47.289
What are you doing?

01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:49.223
I'm going to race against
the Argentinean.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.786
Are you crazy or what?

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:53.619
We've got no choice.

01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:56.079
We don't have time
for the architect thing,

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.832
and we can't risk
Mikel talking to the cops.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.703
Navas, that's enough of that.

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:01.868
That's enough.

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:03.282
No, gorgeous.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.582
I'm going to race in Lisbon.

01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:06.918
There'll be other races.

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:08.494
There won't be any other races,

01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:10.828
Of any ITIOTG chances.

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:14.165
You have to grab them
when they come along, Ari.

01:13:14.583 --> 01:13:15.914
What if you lose?

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.536
It's my money too.

01:13:17.708 --> 01:13:18.869
I'm doing this for you,

01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:20.368
for us.

01:13:23.083 --> 01:13:24.744
You don't care what I think.

01:13:27.917 --> 01:13:29.032
Of course I do.

01:13:33.708 --> 01:13:34.914
Don't worry.

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:36.994
I got it all figured out.

01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:05.073
Count it if you like.

01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:09.702
It's alright.

01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:11.914
There's only 100,000.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.036
Are you wasting my time?

01:14:16.375 --> 01:14:17.786
It's 100,000 plus my car.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.286
That makes it 200,000.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.617
I'll take the car as collateral,
but it's no good to me.

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:26.449
If you lose,
you'll have to get the cash.

01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:27.907
Sure.

01:14:29.875 --> 01:14:30.910
The race...

01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:32.490
is there and back.

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:33.994
Everyone in their own lane.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.240
Got it?

01:16:23.792 --> 01:16:24.702
What's wrong with you?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.537
It was meant to be separate lanes,
and you cut me off half-way.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.540
I got here first,
and that's what counts.

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:31.157
Those weren't your rules!

01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:33.627
Let's do the race again.

01:16:34.667 --> 01:16:35.498
No.

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:36.952
You lost.

01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:39.073
I want my 100,000...

01:16:39.792 --> 01:16:40.907
the day after tomorrow.

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:08.660
Coming!

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:32.573
Cut it out.

01:17:33.667 --> 01:17:35.499
Stop playing with me.

01:17:38.625 --> 01:17:40.366
I just wanted to know
if you were alright.

01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:43.164
And to apologize.

01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:46.078
Yeah, I'm fine, fucking great.

01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:49.159
I left my fiancée for a girl
who wants to rob me blind.

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:50.698
You left your fiancée?

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:52.448
I sure did.

01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.908
And my job, my life, everything.

01:17:55.792 --> 01:17:56.953
And it was worth it.

01:17:59.917 --> 01:18:02.249
Are you still into
running off to somewhere?

01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:04.369
Where do you want to end up?

01:18:07.042 --> 01:18:08.658
I really screwed up.

01:18:11.333 --> 01:18:13.165
But I want to be with you.

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.198
I love you.

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:22.449
- What about Navas?
- I don't care about Navas.

01:18:24.292 --> 01:18:25.282
I love you.

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:47.615
Open up.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.206
Open the door!

01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:11.323
Open up!

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.740
It's Navas.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.865
Open the door!

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.410
Open up!

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.535
What are you doing here?

01:19:29.583 --> 01:19:31.369
There's nothing for you here.

01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:36.453
Get dressed,
we're going on a trip.

01:19:36.583 --> 01:19:40.030
No. This isn't your fucking garage,
you can't walk in giving orders.

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.051
You shut your mouth.

01:19:41.208 --> 01:19:42.414
You're in my home.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:43.865
Get dressed, Ari.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.490
I won the race.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.161
Get out.

01:19:49.167 --> 01:19:51.499
You're staying with this loser?

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:52.998
Come on, Navas...

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:56.743
Stop it!

01:19:58.333 --> 01:20:00.665
Fuck all this.
You're more important than Lisbon.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:02.289
It was all my fault.

01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:05.495
I didn't take care of you,
but that's over.

01:20:06.542 --> 01:20:08.203
It's over, babe, I swear.

01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:13.073
You can't show up here,

01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:14.748
come out with this shit,

01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:16.619
and expect me to come with you.

01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:20.823
Go.

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.243
Fine.

01:20:25.833 --> 01:20:27.494
But you know you're coming.

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:32.074
I'll be at the airport at 8 o'clock,

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.615
waiting for you.

01:20:41.417 --> 01:20:42.953
You know why she'll be there?

01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:44.907
No. You tell me.

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:47.282
Because she loves me.

01:20:48.792 --> 01:20:51.375
You're just a toy to her.

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:54.448
You'll find that out.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.664
I'm sorry.

01:21:05.625 --> 01:21:07.081
Are you thinking about it?

01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:09.539
No.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.661
No.

01:21:12.042 --> 01:21:12.656
But...

01:21:12.833 --> 01:21:14.244
Whatever you choose to do,

01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:15.828
I'll understand.

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:39.496
<i>Hello. This is Ar/'.</i>
<i>Leave a message and I'll call back.</i>

01:21:45.417 --> 01:21:49.456
<i>Hello. This is Ar/'.</i>
<i>Leave a message and I'll call back.</i>

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.365
Where are you going?

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:14.873
Nowhere.

01:22:15.042 --> 01:22:16.282
What are you doing here?

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:18.866
You shouldn't trust
your people so much.

01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:24.208
A trip to Punta del Este.

01:22:25.542 --> 01:22:28.284
Don't make a scene here,
you'll come off worst.

01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:32.326
Do we tell the cops where you got
the money you gave me?

01:22:32.667 --> 01:22:33.953
There's no need for that.

01:22:34.167 --> 01:22:34.952
Good.

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:35.907
Shall we go?

01:22:57.958 --> 01:22:59.448
What are you going to do?

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:02.410
<i>I'll</i> pay you. okay?

01:23:02.833 --> 01:23:04.540
Just give me some time.

01:23:05.333 --> 01:23:06.414
<i>I'll pay Y0“-</i>

01:23:29.917 --> 01:23:31.197
Put his right hand on the block.

01:23:31.292 --> 01:23:32.157
Not my hand, no!

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:34.579
Not my hand!

01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:36.323
I'll pay!

01:23:36.667 --> 01:23:37.657
I'll pay!

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:38.618
No!

01:23:38.792 --> 01:23:40.328
Not my hand! Fuck!

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:41.535
No!

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:42.740
Not that!

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:49.957
You won't be driving again
for a long time.

01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:04.990
Let's go.

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:14.535
Are you okay?

01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:16.414
Sure.

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.288
I'm going to like having breakfast
with you every day.

01:24:28.917 --> 01:24:30.749
It's a text. Check it.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.365
Nah.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.411
Really, Ari, it's fine,
I don't mind.

01:24:34.542 --> 01:24:35.623
You check it.

01:24:45.542 --> 01:24:46.407
What is it?

01:24:47.292 --> 01:24:48.498
Navas!

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.615
Navas...

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:56.490
What happened?

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.240
What happened to you?

01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:00.823
Let's go. Get up.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.206
Who did this to you?

01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:06.414
Ari, get in the car.

01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:11.493
The girl.

01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:13.039
Ari, get in the car.

01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:15.823
Son of a bitch!

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.331
- Don't touch me!
- Let her go!

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:18.035
Stay there!

01:25:18.333 --> 01:25:19.289
Let me go!

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.707
Let me go!

01:25:21.958 --> 01:25:23.414
What the fuck is going on?!

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:27.135
You'll never see her again
unless you pay up.

01:25:28.167 --> 01:25:30.033
And if you're one day late,

01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:33.369
I'll slice off her ears.

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:36.450
- You got that?
- Wait, I don't get it.

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:39.665
I know how you roll,
so you people better hurry.

01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:42.575
But I need time.
I need time. Please.

01:25:43.042 --> 01:25:45.283
I'll call the cops
and tell 'em what you're up to.

01:25:45.667 --> 01:25:46.873
That's what I'll do.

01:25:49.792 --> 01:25:51.328
Then you'll never see her again.

01:26:07.583 --> 01:26:08.698
Fuck!

01:26:14.792 --> 01:26:16.157
How much do you owe him?

01:26:17.542 --> 01:26:18.657
100,000.

01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:23.196
You're rich.
You've got it, right?

01:26:23.208 --> 01:26:25.245
Fuck off, I don't have
that kind of money.

01:26:26.917 --> 01:26:28.533
But you can get it.

01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.324
Yeah, but not overnight.

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.706
Well, you heard the man.

01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:44.581
You're a piece of shit.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.615
Let's go.

01:27:24.542 --> 01:27:25.247
Yes?

01:27:25.417 --> 01:27:26.248
<i>Julia, it's me.</i>

01:27:26.417 --> 01:27:27.782
<i>Sorry to call you like this,</i>

01:27:27.958 --> 01:27:30.370
but I need to come get some stuff.

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.536
I'll send it to you this week.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.457
Julia, please, it's important.

01:27:40.083 --> 01:27:40.914
No.

01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.494
I don't want to see you.

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:43.581
Please.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.536
I'll be there for
half an hour, tops.

01:27:57.292 --> 01:27:58.373
Navas!

01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:00.581
Navas!

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:15.206
Who did this to you?

01:28:15.375 --> 01:28:17.255
The Argentinean and his crew
took me for a walk.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.408
I didn't tell him
where to find you.

01:28:20.083 --> 01:28:21.744
You bet our whole stake,
you lost it,

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:23.869
so you were cutting out
without a word.

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:26.494
You're a son of a bitch.

01:28:26.833 --> 01:28:28.949
I trusted you, and this
is how you pay me back.

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:32.491
What are we gonna do, Navas?

01:28:32.833 --> 01:28:35.495
- We'll help him pay the Argentinean.
- You shut your mouth.

01:28:35.625 --> 01:28:38.065
If Ari hadn't lost it over you
none of this would've happened.

01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:41.698
The Argentinean has Ari.

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:46.957
We have to do the score today,
it's our only chance.

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:52.240
How do we get in?

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:54.824
I'll tell you when,
and I'll convince her to play ball.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.456
But you do not touch her.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:17.660
Hello?

01:29:17.958 --> 01:29:18.948
Julia, it's me.

01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:21.323
I'm sorry,
but I need to see you.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.456
<i>Can I come up?</i>

01:29:25.625 --> 01:29:26.831
I already said no.

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:28.660
Julia...

01:29:30.292 --> 01:29:31.373
We have to talk.

01:29:32.458 --> 01:29:34.165
<i>We have to talk and you know it.</i>

01:29:54.542 --> 01:29:55.498
Julia...

01:29:55.917 --> 01:29:57.032
Just grab it all and go.

01:29:57.333 --> 01:29:58.619
Julia, look at rne, please.

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:00.289
Let's talk.

01:30:02.667 --> 01:30:04.874
Haven't you hurt me enough?

01:30:06.292 --> 01:30:08.203
What are you going to tell me?

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:09.994
That you thought it over?

01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:12.244
That you want rne back?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.707
I need a drink.

01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:15.036
I'm sorry, Julia.

01:31:15.708 --> 01:31:17.039
Forgive me.

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:19.957
Please, Mikel.

01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:21.490
What was that?

01:31:21.917 --> 01:31:23.328
Relax, relax.

01:31:23.625 --> 01:31:24.456
Relax.

01:31:24.583 --> 01:31:26.324
Move and I'll shoot you
in the fucking head!

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:27.740
Hold still! You!

01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:29.998
Where's the safe?

01:31:30.875 --> 01:31:32.616
- Answer me!
- We don't have one.

01:31:33.042 --> 01:31:34.498
I'm going to ask you again.

01:31:35.042 --> 01:31:36.874
Where's the fucking safe?

01:31:38.792 --> 01:31:39.532
Downstairs.

01:31:39.708 --> 01:31:41.415
Down in the office, that way.

01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:07.290
- What the fuck is going on?
- You're making her nervous!

01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:07.958
You shut up!

01:32:12.667 --> 01:32:13.577
That's it.

01:32:19.542 --> 01:32:20.452
Open the safe.

01:32:22.667 --> 01:32:23.498
Open it!

01:32:26.542 --> 01:32:27.498
I can't do it.

01:32:28.292 --> 01:32:29.578
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:32:29.875 --> 01:32:31.832
Open it or I'll blow
your brains out, bitch!

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:44.706
Back, back.

01:32:44.875 --> 01:32:46.081
- Put the fucking gun down!
- No, no, wait!

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:47.490
Julia, you're making it worse.

01:32:47.667 --> 01:32:49.249
Just open the safe.

01:32:50.333 --> 01:32:52.791
The insurance covers it,
just open it and let them go.

01:32:55.042 --> 01:32:56.498
What are you saying, Mikel?

01:32:58.167 --> 01:32:58.907
Open it!

01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:01.615
Open it!

01:33:03.833 --> 01:33:05.289
Open the fucking safe!

01:33:06.083 --> 01:33:07.243
You gonna let him get killed?

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.365
I'm doing it.

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.869
I'm doing it. Please...

01:33:18.042 --> 01:33:19.248
That's it.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.035
That's it.

01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:22.956
Not that one, Julia...

01:33:23.167 --> 01:33:24.202
the other one.

01:33:25.792 --> 01:33:26.657
What?

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.786
You heard me.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.910
The other one.

01:34:02.833 --> 01:34:03.948
There it is.

01:34:22.458 --> 01:34:23.698
You son of a bitch!

01:34:25.375 --> 01:34:27.616
Look at me.
Fucking look at me!

01:34:29.875 --> 01:34:31.582
Why are you doing this to me?

01:34:33.583 --> 01:34:35.244
Fucking answer rne.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.616
I'll pay you back, Julia,
I promise.

01:34:46.583 --> 01:34:48.369
Go away, Mikel.

01:34:49.667 --> 01:34:51.203
Far away.

01:35:27.875 --> 01:35:29.491
We agreed you weren't
going to touch her!

01:35:29.667 --> 01:35:30.498
It all went fine.

01:35:30.667 --> 01:35:31.702
Fine? Fuck you!

01:35:32.417 --> 01:35:34.578
You got the fucking money,
which is all you care about.

01:35:53.875 --> 01:35:54.660
It's all here.

01:35:57.792 --> 01:35:59.328
I always keep my word.

01:36:02.042 --> 01:36:02.952
The girl.

01:36:18.708 --> 01:36:19.573
Are you alright?

01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:20.740
Yeah.

01:36:23.458 --> 01:36:24.619
Let's go.

01:36:27.167 --> 01:36:28.567
- Did they do anything to you?
- No.

01:36:40.375 --> 01:36:41.536
Sorry, princess.

01:36:45.375 --> 01:36:47.161
You're a son of a bitch!

01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:48.539
They were about to kill me.

01:36:48.958 --> 01:36:49.743
Motherfucker.

01:36:49.917 --> 01:36:51.828
That's enough.
It's all over.

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:55.329
What the hell are you doing?

01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:56.206
Where's the money?

01:37:00.958 --> 01:37:02.448
Where the hell
are you going to go?

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:03.914
That's my business.

01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:05.365
Where is it?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.241
- You too, Ari?
- Where's the fucking money?

01:37:13.958 --> 01:37:15.699
We can stay like this
all fucking day.

01:37:17.542 --> 01:37:18.327
Fuck!

01:37:18.542 --> 01:37:19.247
Navas.

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:21.454
The next one's in your head,
then it's Nana's turn.

01:37:23.292 --> 01:37:23.952
In the office.

01:37:24.292 --> 01:37:25.327
It's in the office.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.035
Open door.

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:29.573
Let's go!

01:37:43.417 --> 01:37:44.157
Let's go.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:54.573
Mikel!

01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:55.831
Mikel!

01:37:56.292 --> 01:37:57.248
Mikel!
