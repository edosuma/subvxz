00:01.039 --> 00:02.585
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:02.640 --> 00:04.273
- Oink. Oink.
- What the?

00:04.297 --> 00:05.929
A cop was murdered last night.

00:05.930 --> 00:07.830
A bagman on your payroll?

00:07.866 --> 00:09.999
I think someone is trying
to send you a message.

00:10.035 --> 00:11.267
Grenade!

00:12.837 --> 00:13.970
We have unfinished business.

00:14.005 --> 00:15.805
Listen, if you think you're gonna...

00:15.840 --> 00:18.408
Don't talk about my mother.

00:19.744 --> 00:21.878
An opportunity awaits you.

00:21.913 --> 00:23.446
With you and Barbara,

00:23.481 --> 00:25.615
the three of us
could give all those creeps

00:25.650 --> 00:27.083
a run for their money.

00:27.118 --> 00:28.918
She's making alliances with politicians.

00:28.953 --> 00:30.787
Building a fortress.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.287
She's been planning a war.

00:33.459 --> 00:35.625
Oswald, I want you to
know I forgive you.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.293
You started an orphanage?

00:37.328 --> 00:38.461
I wanted to surprise you.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.996
If you don't kill me,

00:40.031 --> 00:43.466
I will kill everyone you love.

00:48.073 --> 00:49.739
It doesn't stop

00:49.774 --> 00:50.907
till I've butchered

00:50.942 --> 00:53.209
every single swine

00:53.244 --> 00:55.211
on Penguin's payroll.

00:55.246 --> 00:58.775
We both know, Captain Bullock,
you deserve this.

00:58.883 --> 00:59.883
Hold on, buddy.

00:59.918 --> 01:02.085
How long you been
taking money from Penguin?

01:02.120 --> 01:03.386
You got to understand, Jim.

01:03.421 --> 01:05.688
- The debts I got...
- It stops now.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.367 --> 01:18.501
Call dibs on my office?

01:19.904 --> 01:22.672
- I ain't dead yet.
- Just measuring

01:22.707 --> 01:24.307
for when you are.

01:24.342 --> 01:25.775
Shouldn't you be resting?

01:25.810 --> 01:28.377
- Let me help you.
- I'm fine.

01:30.582 --> 01:32.081
Great, so we can talk

01:32.117 --> 01:33.850
about you taking Penguin's money.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.218
I'm not that fine.

01:35.253 --> 01:36.519
I meant what I said, Harvey.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.055
This stops today. You hear me?

01:39.090 --> 01:40.890
- Hey, hey!
- What the hell is that?

01:40.915 --> 01:43.764
- You're trying to change the subject.
- Obviously.

01:43.821 --> 01:46.922
But seriously, what the hell is that?

02:01.638 --> 02:04.840
Some fancy-ass guy on the phone.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.342
How was I supposed to know
what we were carrying?

02:07.377 --> 02:10.078
Stench of death, for starters?

02:10.113 --> 02:11.346
I got a cold.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.614
44 boxes...

02:12.649 --> 02:14.950
one for every cop in the precinct.

02:16.486 --> 02:18.520
Pyg's escalating.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.522
He's not just after dirty cops anymore.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.057
It's the whole GCPD.

02:22.092 --> 02:23.825
There are 45 cops here.

02:23.861 --> 02:26.194
Oh, yeah. The instructions said

02:26.230 --> 02:28.630
don't give nothing to
this one cop here named, uh...

02:29.933 --> 02:31.566
Uh...

02:31.602 --> 02:34.336
Jim Gordon?

02:41.921 --> 02:43.545
Your support, I really appreciate it.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.880
Enjoy the, uh, benefit.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.015
As far as the foundation is concerned...

02:48.686 --> 02:50.085
Helping the needy.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.388
Very good for the soul, Master Bruce.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.025
I have to say I really appreciate

02:57.067 --> 02:59.317
you allowing us
to do the fund-raiser here.

02:59.796 --> 03:02.097
The Society meant a great deal
to your father.

03:02.132 --> 03:04.833
As long as I don't have to leave
the house.

03:04.868 --> 03:07.068
Well, you're Bruce Wayne, ain't you?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.571
The world can come to you.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.206
Hey.

03:11.241 --> 03:12.726
- What the hell?
- Excuse me?

03:12.765 --> 03:15.210
- You knocked into me.
- Bruce.

03:15.245 --> 03:17.779
- Sorry, I didn't notice.
- Well, you should've.

03:17.814 --> 03:20.363
- Bruce.
- Honestly. I'm really sorry.

03:39.803 --> 03:43.071
I haven't wanted to push, Master Bruce.

03:43.106 --> 03:46.448
I mean, what happened with Ra's...

03:46.910 --> 03:48.910
I know that you're hurting.

03:50.914 --> 03:52.047
Just, please, tell me

03:52.082 --> 03:55.250
- what I can do to help.
- You can get off my back.

03:56.732 --> 03:58.353
I'm sorry.

03:59.435 --> 04:01.255
I just...

04:04.227 --> 04:06.576
I can't stop thinking...

04:07.164 --> 04:11.132
about... when I k...

04:16.673 --> 04:19.428
I should feel bad.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.405
Guilty. I...

04:22.612 --> 04:26.114
- I-I just...
- You're just angry.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.928
That anger

04:30.279 --> 04:32.053
is concealing what's really going on.

04:32.089 --> 04:35.855
Unless you face it full-on,

04:36.651 --> 04:38.292
it will consume you.

04:39.144 --> 04:40.886
And it will erupt.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.800
I know...

04:45.042 --> 04:46.942
what you're capable of.

04:47.752 --> 04:49.404
And I don't want to see you

04:49.987 --> 04:52.507
or anybody else get hurt.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.613
I need some air.

05:08.425 --> 05:10.692
All right.

05:12.978 --> 05:15.830
Next time you see red stuff
dripping from a package,

05:15.866 --> 05:17.599
consider calling the police.

05:17.634 --> 05:19.167
We're C.O.D.

05:19.726 --> 05:21.929
Get the hell out of here.

05:22.472 --> 05:24.873
Hey, Jim.

05:28.096 --> 05:29.544
James!

05:29.579 --> 05:32.080
I am so happy
we are working hand in hand

05:32.115 --> 05:34.983
to rid the city of this menace.

05:35.018 --> 05:37.452
He just showed up to, uh, offer his help.

05:37.487 --> 05:38.757
Did he?

05:39.233 --> 05:40.989
Nice to meet you, Jim. I'm Headhunter.

05:41.791 --> 05:43.324
I'm sure you heard of me.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.627
My new security consultant.

05:45.662 --> 05:47.562
Recommended by Victor,

05:47.597 --> 05:49.831
who is off visiting his bubbie.

05:49.866 --> 05:51.533
You want to know why
I carry two pistols?

05:51.568 --> 05:52.901
Overcompensation?

05:52.936 --> 05:55.370
See, I always shoot twice.

05:55.405 --> 05:57.372
The first one does the job.

05:57.407 --> 05:59.307
Every time. But the second one, well...

06:00.510 --> 06:02.444
...that's just my signature.

06:02.479 --> 06:04.145
He has a signature.

06:04.181 --> 06:06.014
Colorful, isn't he?

06:06.049 --> 06:07.082
- Mm-hmm.
- But effective.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.484
Mr. Headhunter and my men

06:09.519 --> 06:11.119
will help the GCPD

06:11.154 --> 06:12.921
until this Pyg situation is resolved.

06:12.956 --> 06:16.458
We don't want your help,
or that of your idiot hit man.

06:17.494 --> 06:19.127
Pyg's actions threaten the both of us.

06:19.162 --> 06:20.762
He's killing

06:20.797 --> 06:24.032
my cops, my employees.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.366
Allegedly.

06:25.402 --> 06:27.602
Get this through your head, Oswald.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.870
We don't work for you,

06:28.905 --> 06:30.138
and we don't work with you.

06:30.173 --> 06:31.306
Ever.

06:33.343 --> 06:37.145
Well, your captain says otherwise.

06:39.282 --> 06:41.583
Excited to work with you, Jim.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.788
Are you out of your frickin' mind?

06:46.823 --> 06:49.224
- Jim, listen...
- You are legitimizing him, Harvey.

06:49.259 --> 06:53.023
He's been legitimized for years.
He was the freaking mayor!

06:53.124 --> 06:54.896
Is it about the money? Is that it?

06:54.931 --> 06:56.698
It's not about that.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.299
How can I know that?

06:58.335 --> 06:59.834
How can you even know that?

06:59.870 --> 07:01.469
Take a look out there, okay?

07:01.505 --> 07:03.104
Half the precinct skipped town

07:03.140 --> 07:05.740
because they didn't want to wear
bacon-flavored death masks.

07:05.775 --> 07:07.642
We need the help.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.744
You are dangerously overreacting.

07:09.779 --> 07:11.446
I'm overreacting because every cop

07:11.481 --> 07:12.892
in this precinct got a death threat.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.082
Except, of course,

07:14.117 --> 07:15.750
- for you.
- So, Penguin's guys

07:15.785 --> 07:17.597
are gonna beat and torture
their way through the city?

07:17.621 --> 07:18.753
Then execute Pyg

07:18.788 --> 07:20.388
- if they find him?
- And?

07:20.423 --> 07:22.090
And the people need to know

07:22.125 --> 07:24.359
they don't need gangsters
to keep them safe.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.651
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna find Pyg,

07:26.698 --> 07:28.363
alive, and I'll bring him to justice.

07:28.398 --> 07:30.198
Good for you.

07:30.233 --> 07:32.200
Three cops just went missing.

07:32.235 --> 07:33.568
Where?

07:33.602 --> 07:36.738
It's gonna be tough. It's the Narrows.

07:41.511 --> 07:42.877
So, that's it.

07:42.913 --> 07:44.312
We're shutting up shop.

07:44.347 --> 07:46.214
So long. Farewell. Toodle-oo.

07:46.249 --> 07:47.649
I can't believe this.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.284
I can.

07:49.319 --> 07:52.120
All this was so I could be
Ra's eyes and ears in Gotham.

07:52.155 --> 07:53.388
He was bankrolling us,

07:53.423 --> 07:55.557
and now he's gone.
So I'm pulling the plug.

07:57.197 --> 07:59.416
Help yourself to whatever.

08:00.096 --> 08:02.661
So all of this... being partners,

08:02.700 --> 08:04.032
building something together...

08:04.067 --> 08:05.333
lies.

08:05.368 --> 08:07.135
A sales pitch.

08:07.170 --> 08:09.504
- I couldn't do it alone.
- We can still spy

08:09.539 --> 08:12.073
on the jerks who come in here
and get intel on jobs.

08:12.108 --> 08:13.208
We can make it work.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.711
What? And the three of us stay together

08:16.746 --> 08:18.313
like a plucky little family?

08:18.348 --> 08:20.114
Well, how about a little parting lesson

08:20.150 --> 08:21.749
from big sis.

08:21.785 --> 08:24.960
In this life, you're on your own.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.914
Always.

08:31.228 --> 08:32.559
Bonus lesson:

08:32.893 --> 08:35.328
never make Bellinis from a can.

08:40.870 --> 08:43.443
I followed a buyer
from the Street Demonz.

08:43.498 --> 08:44.872
They have a chop shop across town,

08:44.908 --> 08:47.787
and I saw exactly
where they hide their stash.

08:48.011 --> 08:50.245
Let's hit it. Show her she's wrong.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.379
We're not gonna rip off

08:51.414 --> 08:52.658
one of Gotham's
biggest motorcycle gangs.

08:52.682 --> 08:54.082
Why not?

08:56.119 --> 08:58.353
You and I will find something else.

09:17.240 --> 09:20.008
All right, PD here,
Penguin's guys over there.

09:21.921 --> 09:24.512
Three missing officers.
Patel from our precinct,

09:24.547 --> 09:25.890
Fisoli and Perkov from the 2-2.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.998
Good Lord, there's blood all over.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.889
He got them here.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.661
Clear view from dozens of
windows. Someone saw it.

09:40.686 --> 09:42.046
They sure did.

09:42.171 --> 09:44.699
All right, bring it in,
everybody. Come on.

09:47.992 --> 09:49.637
This is the Narrows:

09:49.673 --> 09:51.539
the poorest of the poor,

09:51.574 --> 09:53.441
the hardest of the hard.

09:53.476 --> 09:54.876
Now, I don't need to tell you

09:54.911 --> 09:57.007
that they got a code of silence
down here,

09:57.046 --> 09:59.447
which means we got to make 'em
more scared of us

09:59.482 --> 10:01.941
than they are of their own people.

10:02.012 --> 10:04.574
We go floor by floor.

10:04.654 --> 10:05.787
Airmail!

10:15.999 --> 10:18.132
Let's get 'em! Move on out!

10:22.372 --> 10:24.372
This is gonna be fun.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.590
Hey! Hey!

10:40.621 --> 10:41.680
Get off of him!

10:41.716 --> 10:44.583
Get back.

10:48.659 --> 10:50.072
Hey! Hey!

10:50.128 --> 10:51.385
Get off! Get off of him.

10:51.409 --> 10:53.426
They're potential witnesses.
They're not perps.

10:53.466 --> 10:55.504
This is the Narrows, Gordon.
You think there's a difference?

10:55.528 --> 10:57.450
- Step away, Ruseckas.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:57.535 --> 11:01.906
Ruseckas, they need you upstairs.
You two, go. Now.

11:06.213 --> 11:07.512
Working out great.

11:07.585 --> 11:10.419
If it gets me my cop killer,
yeah, it is.

11:10.455 --> 11:12.421
Right.

11:20.398 --> 11:21.597
Bruce?

11:21.633 --> 11:23.666
I just wanted to say hi.

11:25.808 --> 11:28.671
I'm Grace. We went to school together.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.606
Grace Blomdhal.

11:30.995 --> 11:32.975
Yeah.

11:33.011 --> 11:34.310
Sorry I d...

11:34.533 --> 11:36.924
It's been years...
I didn't even recognize you.

11:37.127 --> 11:38.581
I heard you were homeschooling.

11:38.616 --> 11:39.916
Yeah.

11:39.951 --> 11:41.751
I, um...

11:42.252 --> 11:44.169
Why aren't you in school?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.523
'Cause it's Saturday.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.360
I don't mean to knock your fund-raiser,

11:51.396 --> 11:53.963
but is there any chance
you're as bored as I am?

11:57.037 --> 11:59.605
You'd have to be pretty bored.

11:59.804 --> 12:02.104
So do you want to maybe go somewhere?

12:04.609 --> 12:06.776
Yeah.

12:20.692 --> 12:22.391
May I?

12:23.861 --> 12:25.982
Ma'am, please.

12:34.272 --> 12:35.705
I'm Detective Gordon.

12:35.866 --> 12:37.907
We didn't see nothin'.

12:37.942 --> 12:40.142
But you knew those missing cops.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.026
Or knew of 'em. Right?

12:43.548 --> 12:46.282
Three officers, different precinct,

12:46.317 --> 12:49.852
same patrol car...
they were freelancing.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.893
Look, I know how it is down here.

12:53.024 --> 12:56.225
A lot of bad stuff happens; half
the time it's the cops doing it.

12:56.617 --> 12:59.595
They were running some sort of
protection racket, am I right?

13:02.633 --> 13:06.110
You sit over here. Yeah?

13:06.270 --> 13:08.070
It gives you a pretty good view.

13:08.106 --> 13:09.774
So what'd you see?

13:09.908 --> 13:11.742
Please, I need you to leave.

13:12.043 --> 13:14.310
No one's gonna know
you told me anything.

13:14.345 --> 13:16.012
I give you my word.

13:20.051 --> 13:21.951
Can I help?

13:21.986 --> 13:23.085
Get out of here.

13:23.121 --> 13:24.687
Now.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.489
Will do, Jim.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.392
Hey!

13:32.397 --> 13:35.338
This is ridiculous.
We're all on the same team.

13:41.305 --> 13:43.413
No, no, come on.

13:43.574 --> 13:46.042
Come on. Come, come... yeah.

13:46.872 --> 13:48.577
If the old lady doesn't talk,

13:48.613 --> 13:50.813
the old man gets it!

13:50.848 --> 13:53.849
And after that,
I go apartment by apartment

13:53.885 --> 13:55.651
until I get an answer!

13:56.357 --> 13:57.724
Drop it!

13:57.855 --> 13:58.988
Back atcha, Jim.

14:00.425 --> 14:01.709
Oh!

14:01.926 --> 14:04.193
Oh! Everybody stand down!

14:04.228 --> 14:06.395
- I'm giving you three seconds.
- I'm giving you two.

14:06.431 --> 14:07.897
No one is counting!

14:07.932 --> 14:09.598
You drop your weapon!

14:13.738 --> 14:15.638
I'll tell you what I saw!

14:17.602 --> 14:19.642
He took them.

14:20.137 --> 14:23.472
He was driving a hearse.
I didn't see the plate.

14:23.548 --> 14:25.414
It's all right.

14:25.450 --> 14:27.083
We don't need the plate.

14:27.621 --> 14:29.605
Just tell me which direction
was he headed.

14:29.675 --> 14:32.277
Down 7th. Heading west.

14:33.825 --> 14:36.025
Hey, thanks, Jim.

14:36.060 --> 14:39.061
You know, I never really did the
whole good-cop/bad-cop thing.

14:39.097 --> 14:41.030
It's quite effective.

14:43.568 --> 14:45.668
West on 7th... that's Hoover Island.

14:45.703 --> 14:48.170
It's tiny... there's only a
couple of abandoned buildings.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.506
We can canvass the whole area
in ten minutes.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.640
Yeah.

14:51.676 --> 14:52.842
And the second shot...

14:52.877 --> 14:54.543
well, that's just my signature.

14:54.579 --> 14:56.745
I know it doesn't look good,

14:56.781 --> 14:58.848
but no one got hurt too bad.

14:58.883 --> 15:00.516
And we got what we needed, right?

15:00.551 --> 15:03.552
You just, you got to trust me
on this one, partner, okay?

15:03.588 --> 15:05.020
People, we're moving out

15:05.056 --> 15:07.690
to Hoover Island right now!
Let's move! Go!

15:07.725 --> 15:09.058
Go!

15:09.093 --> 15:10.359
Come on!

15:30.151 --> 15:32.251
Last door, let's go!

15:38.687 --> 15:40.626
Empty.

15:41.726 --> 15:43.359
I got two in here!

15:52.854 --> 15:54.571
This man is alive. Call an ambulance.

15:58.176 --> 15:59.209
Help me.

15:59.244 --> 16:00.577
- We will. We're here.
- Jim!

16:00.612 --> 16:03.880
Pyg disappeared. There's no sign
of the third cop anywhere.

16:03.915 --> 16:05.481
All right. Get some help.

16:06.518 --> 16:08.017
Hold on.

16:11.022 --> 16:12.488
My God.

16:12.524 --> 16:14.524
It's okay.

16:14.559 --> 16:15.925
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>

16:15.961 --> 16:18.178
<i>we just had a major police operation.</i>

16:18.240 --> 16:19.440
<i>A raid of some sort on this...</i>

16:19.464 --> 16:21.297
Sofia, look!

16:21.333 --> 16:22.866
Those are my men.

16:22.901 --> 16:26.369
And there's that Headhunter
person I was talking about.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.706
Kind of a moron, but... he is effective.

16:29.741 --> 16:30.974
<i>...at the scene.</i>

16:31.009 --> 16:32.854
<i>Another is in stable condition
and on his way...</i>

16:32.878 --> 16:36.112
So, technically,

16:36.147 --> 16:37.947
I saved that cop's life.

16:39.417 --> 16:42.118
Such great PR.

16:45.490 --> 16:47.156
Excuse me. Little person.

16:47.192 --> 16:48.391
Scoot.

16:58.336 --> 16:59.569
Is co-opting the police

16:59.604 --> 17:02.438
not the most brilliant idea
I have ever had?

17:02.474 --> 17:04.446
It is Pax Penguina

17:04.486 --> 17:06.608
taken to a whole other level.

17:10.415 --> 17:12.147
Hello?

17:12.183 --> 17:13.750
Isn't it?

17:13.785 --> 17:16.719
Oh. You don't need to know what I think.

17:16.755 --> 17:19.255
Well, now I definitely do.

17:22.948 --> 17:24.281
Ears.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.344
My father never would have

17:27.396 --> 17:29.532
publicly aligned with the GCPD.

17:29.567 --> 17:33.036
They are incompetent and unreliable.

17:33.071 --> 17:35.772
Eventually, they will fail
and fail big, and...

17:35.807 --> 17:38.090
you will fail with them.

17:38.276 --> 17:40.176
So...

17:40.379 --> 17:42.111
that's what I think.

17:43.281 --> 17:45.481
Thank you for your input.

17:45.517 --> 17:47.283
You're welcome, Oswald.

17:49.754 --> 17:53.523
Because you have shown me
very clearly what not to do.

17:53.558 --> 17:54.691
In fact...

17:54.726 --> 17:56.459
I'm gonna get more involved.

17:56.501 --> 17:58.668
Personally.

17:59.698 --> 18:02.875
Don't ask for my opinion
if you don't want to hear it.

18:04.336 --> 18:06.135
Okay.

18:34.899 --> 18:36.666
- Look at that!
- Aw!

18:39.237 --> 18:40.983
- Come on!
- Aw!

19:13.420 --> 19:16.864
- Yo! The alarm's going off!
- What the hell!

19:17.709 --> 19:19.638
Someone broke in?

19:20.211 --> 19:22.865
I was... I was under the car.

19:23.081 --> 19:24.380
The stash is gone.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.145
Guy must've got out.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.251
So you must've messed up your only job.

19:30.088 --> 19:33.289
Guess it's time to burn rubber.

19:33.324 --> 19:35.491
Wait! No!

19:35.527 --> 19:37.393
No!

19:37.429 --> 19:39.429
Let go! I didn't do anyth... Aah!

19:39.464 --> 19:42.198
Aah! No! No!

19:42.233 --> 19:43.499
No!

20:06.491 --> 20:08.558
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey.</i>

20:08.593 --> 20:09.859
We scanned the entire area...

20:09.894 --> 20:12.061
still no sign of Pyg or Officer Patel.

20:12.097 --> 20:15.631
- <i>You get anything off Fisoli?</i>
- No. No. I'll, uh...

20:15.667 --> 20:18.401
Wait, wait. He's coming to.
I'll call you back.

20:18.456 --> 20:19.936
Officer Fisoli.

20:19.971 --> 20:21.437
It's okay. It's all right.

20:21.473 --> 20:23.423
You're on your way to Gotham General.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.908
You're safe. I'm Detective Gordon.

20:26.065 --> 20:29.220
- I know who you are.
- You were taken by the Pyg.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.681
Did you happen to see his face?

20:31.716 --> 20:34.437
Nah, he wore a mask.

20:34.686 --> 20:36.319
The others?

20:37.362 --> 20:39.445
Perkov didn't make it.

20:39.523 --> 20:41.190
Patel's gone missing.

20:41.226 --> 20:43.759
- Do you remember anything?
- I don't know, man.

20:43.795 --> 20:46.095
He was torturing us for hours.

20:46.131 --> 20:50.355
He was singing nursery rhymes...
talking crazy.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.902
Oh, geez.

20:52.937 --> 20:54.937
I watched him bleed out Perkov.

20:54.973 --> 20:58.262
- Did he say anything about Patel?
- I don't know. I don't remember.

20:58.308 --> 20:59.619
Look at me.

20:59.644 --> 21:00.610
- Look what he did to me.
- Okay,

21:00.645 --> 21:02.211
all right, all right, all right.

21:02.247 --> 21:04.247
Let's take a break.

21:09.638 --> 21:11.739
Why is he doing this?

21:12.816 --> 21:14.449
'Cause he's insane.

21:14.492 --> 21:17.260
But it's more than that.

21:17.295 --> 21:20.396
I guess he's just
reached a breaking point.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.834
There's so much rot in Gotham.

21:25.072 --> 21:27.339
All of it, high to low.

21:29.607 --> 21:32.742
Sometimes even I feel
like breaking, you know?

21:38.341 --> 21:40.843
I was on Penguin's pad.

21:42.220 --> 21:44.901
Started off small stuff...

21:45.370 --> 21:49.143
deliveries and... payoffs... and then...

21:50.229 --> 21:52.028
it got bad.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.629
I get it.

21:53.909 --> 21:56.465
I've done bad stuff myself.

21:58.865 --> 22:00.836
For Penguin, even.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.508
But you and I can make it right.

22:05.543 --> 22:07.143
Once I get Pyg,

22:07.312 --> 22:09.946
I'm gonna take down the Pax Penguina.

22:10.124 --> 22:13.874
And then I'm gonna go after
the dirty cops, one by one.

22:14.385 --> 22:16.452
Now you have a chance

22:16.654 --> 22:18.688
to make right what you've done wrong.

22:19.724 --> 22:21.290
Help me.

22:25.063 --> 22:27.163
Pyg is planning something.

22:27.811 --> 22:29.832
Nearby. He was...

22:29.867 --> 22:31.834
Maybe where he took Patel.

22:31.869 --> 22:34.732
He-he kept saying something about,

22:35.169 --> 22:37.847
"I'll bring justice to where there is,

22:38.430 --> 22:40.746
uh, justice no more."

22:41.715 --> 22:43.646
Justice. A courthouse.

22:43.856 --> 22:46.048
There ain't no courthouse
in the Narrows.

22:46.217 --> 22:47.994
There's one they abandoned
a few years back.

22:48.019 --> 22:49.485
Pull it over!

22:49.520 --> 22:51.902
- I'm getting out.
- Yes, sir.

22:52.056 --> 22:54.667
- Thank you, Officer Fisoli.
- Hey.

22:55.533 --> 22:58.501
You are one of the good ones, Jim.

23:13.711 --> 23:15.278
Hey, Brant.

23:15.524 --> 23:18.752
I ran into an old friend. Bruce Wayne.

23:20.084 --> 23:22.018
Bruce, this is Emma Hsueh
and Tommy Elliott.

23:26.308 --> 23:28.375
You two know each other?

23:28.426 --> 23:31.127
Oh, yeah. Last time I saw this
guy, he punched me in the face.

23:35.099 --> 23:36.732
I should go.

23:36.768 --> 23:38.534
Hey, hold on, bro.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.245
I totally deserved it.

23:40.388 --> 23:41.989
If anything,
you should've hit me harder.

23:42.091 --> 23:45.567
So true. He was such a jerk back then.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.987
Okay.

23:48.023 --> 23:49.289
Little heads-up, next time

23:49.314 --> 23:51.650
you just bring some
random kid to my place...

23:51.697 --> 23:54.784
- Parents' place, Brant.
- He's so jealous.

23:54.819 --> 23:56.919
Brant wanted Grace all to himself.

23:58.289 --> 23:59.255
Whatever.

23:59.290 --> 24:00.389
Uh, you want a shot?

24:00.425 --> 24:02.591
Maybe sample some party favors?

24:02.627 --> 24:03.926
I'm good.

24:03.961 --> 24:07.263
Oh, I forgot about
this guy. Total animal.

24:07.298 --> 24:09.103
So what do you do for fun?

24:09.981 --> 24:12.603
I used to walk on rooftops
and fight crime.

24:13.189 --> 24:15.002
Now I'm not so sure.

24:15.373 --> 24:18.274
Whoa! You're a bigger dork
than I remember.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.477
Just kidding. Hey, whatever
happened to that, uh, that,

24:21.512 --> 24:23.346
that creepy old guy, the butler?

24:23.381 --> 24:25.448
Is he still, uh, buttling?

24:29.187 --> 24:30.453
Kidding.

24:31.723 --> 24:33.222
It's a joke.

24:33.843 --> 24:35.210
Seriously, does he buttle with you?

24:35.234 --> 24:37.141
Bruce!

24:37.242 --> 24:39.234
Stop! Oh, my God!

24:39.831 --> 24:42.264
Stop!

24:46.540 --> 24:48.190
So, does he buttle with you?

24:50.013 --> 24:52.480
Brant, didn't you say
you had a hookup at that club?

24:52.744 --> 24:54.677
Yeah. Yeah, this is lame.

24:54.712 --> 24:56.379
Let's go.

25:01.419 --> 25:04.263
Brant's a tool, but this'll be fun.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.571
Whoa, there... partner.

25:23.187 --> 25:24.807
You followed me?

25:24.842 --> 25:25.975
Didn't have to.

25:26.010 --> 25:27.690
Your captain told me
where you were headed.

25:29.213 --> 25:31.847
I guess he thought
maybe you needed some help.

25:49.934 --> 25:51.333
Hi, Jim.

25:51.369 --> 25:53.169
Thanks for leading the way.

25:53.204 --> 25:55.037
We'll take it from here.

26:12.769 --> 26:15.116
Keep watching me like that and
I'll think you don't trust me.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.106
Just give me my money
so I can get out of here.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.147
Where are you?

26:23.174 --> 26:25.189
<i>Okay, I don't want
to hear how I'm an idiot.</i>

26:25.260 --> 26:26.626
I'm at the Demonz' place.

26:26.662 --> 26:29.119
It's, uh... it's bad.

26:29.197 --> 26:31.665
- What?
- <i>I'm hiding, but...</i>

26:32.510 --> 26:34.172
there are three of 'em,

26:34.269 --> 26:36.250
strapped.

26:36.312 --> 26:37.637
And they just called backup.

26:37.673 --> 26:39.439
You idiot.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.908
<i>How about you yell at me
after you come get me?</i>

26:41.944 --> 26:43.710
Just wait right there.

26:43.745 --> 26:46.212
I kind of have to.

26:48.250 --> 26:50.817
Selina's at the Demonz'.
We got to get her.

26:50.852 --> 26:53.132
Isn't this what they call
a teachable moment?

26:53.187 --> 26:56.056
- Let her claw her way out.
- We owe her.

26:56.091 --> 26:58.491
That is what her salary was for.

26:58.628 --> 26:59.927
Look, she only went there

26:59.975 --> 27:01.828
to prove that we can make this work,

27:01.863 --> 27:03.563
us running heists together.

27:03.598 --> 27:07.000
Oh. Then she might have
considered not getting caught.

27:07.035 --> 27:08.802
She just wants a purpose.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.270
She wants a home.

27:10.305 --> 27:11.705
Mm. Then sucks for her.

27:11.740 --> 27:13.907
You know, I thought you'd changed.

27:13.942 --> 27:15.241
Like maybe you could think

27:15.277 --> 27:17.077
about somebody other
than yourself for once.

27:17.112 --> 27:18.712
Then sucks for you.

27:29.989 --> 27:32.625
It was my idea to offer
my consulting services.

27:32.661 --> 27:36.730
And I daresay it has been
a smashing success,

27:36.765 --> 27:40.090
the Pax Penguina taken
to the tactical level.

27:40.207 --> 27:43.269
And now we have reason to believe
that the notorious Pyg is trapped

27:43.305 --> 27:45.286
in the courthouse behind us.

27:45.379 --> 27:48.145
Look, I know it's a bit of a circus.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.054
But there was no way in hell
I was gonna let you go

27:50.078 --> 27:52.323
in there alone, all right? The
Pyg ain't gonna go down easy.

27:52.347 --> 27:55.048
So I say we let Penguin's thugs
go in first... let them be

27:55.083 --> 27:57.250
the cannon fodder instead of our guys.

27:57.285 --> 27:58.418
It's win-win.

27:58.453 --> 28:00.333
End of conversation.

28:05.427 --> 28:07.027
Yeah.

28:07.062 --> 28:10.597
<i>Did you know I spell my name with a "Y"?</i>

28:11.633 --> 28:13.133
I didn't.

28:13.168 --> 28:15.301
You want to meet me somewhere,
we can talk about it?

28:15.337 --> 28:18.304
<i>Please, Jim, I'm not that dumb.</i>

28:18.630 --> 28:21.599
<i>Anyway, P-Y-G.</i>

28:21.684 --> 28:24.978
<i>The "Y" is because it's short
for "Pygmalion."</i>

28:25.067 --> 28:28.399
<i>Like I'm creating a new, better Gotham.</i>

28:28.516 --> 28:32.102
<i>And I'm creating a new you, Jim.</i>

28:32.165 --> 28:35.789
- Really?
<i>- Yes, except there's a slight hitch.</i>

28:35.891 --> 28:40.008
<i>I can't recreate you
if you're, you know...</i>

28:40.095 --> 28:41.662
<i>dead.</i>

28:41.763 --> 28:46.566
<i>Which you will be if you go in there.</i>

28:49.959 --> 28:51.104
In where?

28:51.139 --> 28:53.106
<i>Oh, don't act dumb.</i>

28:53.141 --> 28:55.775
<i>Only I get to do that.</i>

28:56.084 --> 28:59.779
<i>Let them play cops and robbers.
It'll be fun.</i>

28:59.815 --> 29:00.980
<i>But not you.</i>

29:01.016 --> 29:03.316
Why should I believe anything
you have to say?

29:03.351 --> 29:04.984
<i>Because...</i>

29:05.102 --> 29:08.247
<i>you are one of the good ones, Jim.</i>

30:58.366 --> 30:59.966
Call it off!

31:00.001 --> 31:01.434
Call off the raid.

31:01.469 --> 31:03.303
Fisoli's dead.

31:03.338 --> 31:05.471
The guy in the ambulance
was the Pyg in disguise.

31:05.507 --> 31:07.618
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Pyg called me.

31:07.642 --> 31:09.962
He warned me off.
He used the same phrase

31:10.001 --> 31:11.444
he used in the ambulance.

31:11.479 --> 31:13.791
He fed us the clue to get us here.

31:13.949 --> 31:15.248
It has to be a trap.

31:15.634 --> 31:19.252
So the insane serial killer
who hates cops

31:19.287 --> 31:21.549
warned you to save your life

31:21.656 --> 31:24.529
- because why, now?
- Because I'm against dirty cops.

31:24.599 --> 31:26.896
Except all of the times you are one.

31:27.295 --> 31:30.365
I'm telling you, Harvey, call it off.

31:30.568 --> 31:32.031
Call it off.

31:32.067 --> 31:33.433
I have another

31:33.468 --> 31:36.095
interpretation, Jim. The Pyg
is not trying to save you.

31:36.150 --> 31:38.838
He's trying to save himself
by stopping the raid.

31:38.873 --> 31:40.373
You are being played.

31:40.408 --> 31:42.642
And not for the first time, I might add.

31:42.677 --> 31:44.344
We called Gotham General.

31:44.379 --> 31:47.680
They can't locate Fisoli
or the ambulance.

31:47.716 --> 31:50.492
Jim, it's Gotham General.
It's a madhouse down there.

31:50.554 --> 31:53.119
If I'm correct, the Pyg
isn't even in the courthouse.

31:53.154 --> 31:54.654
I came directly from the ambulance.

31:54.689 --> 31:57.297
There is no way he beat me here.

31:57.376 --> 32:00.126
You're wrong! Pyg is in there, Jim!

32:00.161 --> 32:01.094
He's right!

32:01.129 --> 32:02.629
We got a spotter across the street

32:02.664 --> 32:05.231
that got a visual on Pyg in there,

32:05.267 --> 32:07.500
standing next to Patel tied to a chair.

32:07.535 --> 32:09.235
- I swear.
- Look,

32:09.271 --> 32:11.704
I can't explain it.
All I know is, this is a trap.

32:11.740 --> 32:13.239
Now, you asked me to trust you.

32:13.275 --> 32:16.063
I am asking you to trust me.

32:18.305 --> 32:20.364
Ugh! It's so tiresome!

32:20.415 --> 32:22.749
- Start the operation!
- Let's go.

32:22.784 --> 32:24.217
Jim, I'm sorry.

32:24.252 --> 32:27.453
I'm with Penguin on this one.
We got to think about Patel.

32:28.089 --> 32:30.323
Let's move out, people!

32:30.358 --> 32:33.926
You better pray I can clean up
your mess on this one, Harvey.

32:33.962 --> 32:35.828
- You are out of line, pal!
- And you are

32:35.864 --> 32:37.178
gonna get our guys slaughtered!

32:37.225 --> 32:40.066
Jim Gordon, I am ordering you
to stand down!

32:40.769 --> 32:44.431
Finally, a good idea, Harvey! Boys?

32:44.502 --> 32:46.681
We've gone over the game plan, people.

32:46.776 --> 32:48.943
You know what to do. Let's go.

33:00.907 --> 33:03.945
- When's our guys coming?
- How should I know? You called them.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.393
It's about time.

33:18.437 --> 33:19.669
Come on.

33:19.705 --> 33:21.271
Come on.

33:34.453 --> 33:35.719
I'll draw their fire.

33:35.754 --> 33:37.621
You see an opening, run.

33:37.656 --> 33:40.857
Screw that. Whatever we're
doing, we're doing together.

33:43.362 --> 33:45.706
Well... I guess now we see

33:45.738 --> 33:47.316
if I taught you how to use that whip.

33:47.378 --> 33:49.812
Hello? Excuse me?

33:50.078 --> 33:51.868
- Did you guys order Thai?
- No.

33:51.904 --> 33:54.137
Good, 'cause I don't have any.

34:01.413 --> 34:03.271
- Nice shooting.
- Obviously.

34:03.322 --> 34:04.722
Give me my cut.

34:05.896 --> 34:08.782
- Barbara.
- I'm sorry.

34:08.851 --> 34:09.886
Did you want a hug?

34:09.922 --> 34:12.722
I just killed five guys for you.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.159
Actually, we did it together.

34:18.664 --> 34:20.914
So that's it?

34:21.366 --> 34:23.733
We're just... over?

34:24.062 --> 34:25.668
Over?

34:26.705 --> 34:29.759
Think I came down here for kicks?

34:31.219 --> 34:32.976
You're coming back to the nest.

34:33.011 --> 34:34.210
We got a shipment coming in

34:34.246 --> 34:36.012
and a business to run.

34:38.449 --> 34:41.129
Well, come on.

35:13.719 --> 35:15.151
Hey!

35:15.187 --> 35:17.691
Got him! Come on!

35:20.934 --> 35:23.028
Harvey.

35:23.536 --> 35:26.396
Damn it!

35:26.981 --> 35:28.898
Oh, no.

35:31.103 --> 35:32.369
Patel.

35:32.404 --> 35:34.227
Oh...

35:34.339 --> 35:35.899
Oh, no.

35:35.974 --> 35:38.875
It's a setup!

35:47.486 --> 35:49.219
Get out!

35:57.471 --> 35:59.796
The exits are blocked!

36:01.503 --> 36:03.574
That's not our guns.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.761
They're pinned down.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.672
- Get in there.
- Back up!

36:08.707 --> 36:09.806
Mm-mm.

36:10.642 --> 36:12.609
Get in there!

36:36.835 --> 36:38.516
Headhunter's hit!

36:39.571 --> 36:41.571
Ruseckas! Harper!

36:41.606 --> 36:42.772
Get Patel, now!

36:46.812 --> 36:48.478
Shoot the chain!

36:49.957 --> 36:51.757
Get down!

36:57.422 --> 36:58.888
Come on.

37:53.211 --> 37:55.406
I did not order the cops in there.

37:55.469 --> 37:57.085
I do not have that authority.

37:57.132 --> 37:59.982
I made a suggestion.
It was Captain Bullock...

38:00.036 --> 38:01.464
Gordon. Gordon!

38:01.508 --> 38:03.842
How did you find the courage to run in

38:03.877 --> 38:05.744
and save all of those people?

38:08.682 --> 38:10.639
If the Pyg is watching...

38:10.917 --> 38:13.418
the GCPD is gonna take you down.

38:17.958 --> 38:20.725
And that was Detective James
Gordon with a very modest,

38:20.761 --> 38:22.994
if I may say, statement about

38:23.029 --> 38:24.696
- his genuinely heroic...
- Thanks, Jim.

38:24.731 --> 38:26.998
- Way to go, Jim.
- Thanks.

38:31.872 --> 38:34.305
They think Patel's gonna make it.

38:36.076 --> 38:38.209
Congratulations, Jim.

38:38.736 --> 38:40.411
You're a hero.

38:41.302 --> 38:43.552
And I'm just the cop

38:43.784 --> 38:46.044
who shot a cop.

38:57.063 --> 38:58.463
This is Gordon.

<i>Wow.</i>

38:59.933 --> 39:01.733
<i>You were amazing.</i>

39:01.768 --> 39:04.495
Oh, I was right about you.

39:04.638 --> 39:08.406
You are a "get things done"
type, Jim Gordon.

39:08.441 --> 39:11.517
Oh, and those things
that you want to get done...

39:11.578 --> 39:15.480
well... they're the same things I want.

39:15.515 --> 39:17.662
Only if you want to go to prison
for the rest of your life.

39:17.686 --> 39:19.484
Well, now that's just mean.

39:19.771 --> 39:21.493
I'm gonna find you.

39:21.865 --> 39:24.826

39:35.735 --> 39:39.330

well, gave me an idea.
