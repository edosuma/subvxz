09:49.709 --> 09:52.750
YOU KNOW? AND--AND SHE'S KIND
AND SO PRETTY.

09:52.792 --> 09:56.041
AND... I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE N-- (chuckles)

09:56.083 --> 09:59.041
I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS WAY BEFORE. (laughs)

09:59.083 --> 10:03.542
IT'S JUST NICE TO CONNECT
WITH SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW?

10:03.583 --> 10:06.041
SO IT'S ROMANTIC, THEN?

10:06.083 --> 10:08.625
I WANT IT TO BE.

10:08.667 --> 10:12.417
I GET THE FEELING
SHE DOES, TOO.

10:12.458 --> 10:16.709
NICK, I HAVE TO ASK YOU...

10:16.750 --> 10:19.750
HOW OLD IS SHE?

10:25.208 --> 10:28.291
HE SAID SHE WAS 25,
BUT... HE HESITATED.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.542
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE WAS LYING.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.166
NO, NO. HIS DEMEANOR.
HE WAS EXCITED.

10:31.208 --> 10:32.583
ALMOST EUPHORIC.

10:32.625 --> 10:33.583
EUPHORIA ISN'T UNCOMMON

10:33.625 --> 10:35.250
WHEN THE S.S.R.I.s
START TO WORK

10:35.291 --> 10:36.500
AND THE DEPRESSION LIFTS.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.375
HE WAS ACTING
LIKE A SCHOOLBOY IN LOVE.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.291
SO YOU'RE AFRAID HE'S IN LOVE
WITH A LITTLE GIRL?

10:40.333 --> 10:42.458
I'M AFRAID HE'S IN LOVE
WITH SARAH NELSON.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.333
WOW. THAT'S QUITE A LEAP.

10:44.375 --> 10:45.542
AW, COME ON, DIANE.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.333
YOU SAW HIM IN THE E.R.
AFTER SHE DISAPPEARED.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.083
HOW COULD HE
HAVE TAKEN HER?
I DON'T KNOW,

10:49.125 --> 10:51.166
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT HE WOULD BE THIS EXCITED

10:51.208 --> 10:53.375
ABOUT HAVING A RELATIONSHIP
WITH AN AGE-APPROPRIATE WOMAN.

10:53.417 --> 10:56.375
YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT THERAPIST,
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS

10:56.417 --> 10:58.291
THAT MAKE EVEN THE PSYCHIATRIC
COMMUNITY UNCOMFORTABLE.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.041
OH, THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO

11:00.083 --> 11:02.208
WITH FINDING PEDOPHILIA
TO BE REPUGNANT OR--

11:02.250 --> 11:04.583
OKAY, THEN MAYBE
IT'S COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.

11:04.625 --> 11:05.834
WHAT?

11:05.875 --> 11:08.083
YOU EFFECTIVELY ACCUSED HIM
OF TAKING SARAH,

11:08.125 --> 11:09.166
AND YOU WERE WRONG.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.375
OBVIOUSLY, THE GUILT YOU FEEL

11:10.417 --> 11:13.166
OVER DESTROYING
THE TRUST WITH A PATIENT--

11:13.208 --> 11:15.041
IT'S OVERWHELMING.
WAIT.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.959
YOU'RE SAYING THAT I CONCOCTED
THIS SCENARIO WHERE HE TOOK HER

11:18.000 --> 11:21.375
TO ASSUAGE MY GUILT ABOUT
ACCUSING HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE?

11:21.417 --> 11:23.375
I DON'T KNOW. DID YOU?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.500
(huffs) I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.375
SHELDON, YOUR PATIENT
WAS SUICIDAL

11:27.417 --> 11:29.208
AND JUST CAME BACK
INTO THERAPY.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.959
YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ACCUSE HIM
WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE--

11:32.000 --> 11:33.041
IT WORRIES ME.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.208
A LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE
IS AT STAKE.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.500
I THINK THIS IS
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

11:51.375 --> 11:52.583
MARK TWAIN.

11:52.625 --> 11:54.959
YOU'RE THE TUXEDO GUY
FROM THE E.R.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.041
OH.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.291
OH, YOU'RE
THE CHOCOLATE GIRL... WOMAN.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.041
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

12:02.083 --> 12:05.041
I HAD A WIG ON
AT THE HOSPITAL,

12:05.083 --> 12:06.917
OUT IN PUBLIC,
AND LISTEN,

12:06.959 --> 12:08.166
I WAS REALLY RUDE
THE OTHER DAY.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.875
NO, IT'S FINE.
I UNDERSTAND.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.083
NO, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

12:11.125 --> 12:13.166
I'VE BONDED WITH PEOPLE
IN THIS SITUATION BEFORE,

12:13.208 --> 12:14.458
NOT HERE, BUT IN CHEMO,

12:14.500 --> 12:19.041
AND ONE DAY YOU SHOW UP,
AND... SHE DOESN'T.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.250
AND YOU REALLY WANT
TO TELL YOURSELF

12:21.291 --> 12:22.166
THAT SHE'S IN REMISSION

12:22.208 --> 12:23.834
AND SHE'S TAKING
THAT TRIP TO PARIS

12:23.875 --> 12:25.291
THAT SHE'S
ALWAYS DREAMED OF.

12:25.333 --> 12:28.041
BUT SINCE YOU BROKE YOUR OWN
RULES AND GOT FRIENDLY,

12:28.083 --> 12:29.208
YOU'RE FRIENDS.

12:29.250 --> 12:33.041
SO HER HUSBAND CALLS YOU
AND TELLS YOU THAT SHE DIED.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.041
WELL, I'M SORRY.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.959
ME, TOO.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.333
SO WE CAN CHITCHAT,

12:38.375 --> 12:41.083
'CAUSE IT'S WEIRD TO SIT HERE
AND NOT SAY ANYTHING,

12:41.125 --> 12:44.959
BUT IT DOESN'T GO
BEYOND THAT, OKAY?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.041
NICE WEATHER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

12:47.083 --> 12:48.333
BEAUTIFUL.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.625
(door opens)

12:49.667 --> 12:51.333
(man) MIRANDA?

12:51.375 --> 12:52.291
SEE YA.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.250
YEAH.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.542
(whirring)

12:57.583 --> 12:59.917
(man) Hold still.

12:59.959 --> 13:03.709
(whirring continues)

13:06.000 --> 13:07.333
(knock on door)

13:07.375 --> 13:08.333
GOT A MINUTE?

13:08.375 --> 13:10.375
(exhales) NO.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.041
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.792
THE COPS MADE AN ARREST
LAST NIGHT.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.458
THE GUY WHO TOOK SARAH NELSON
FROM THE E.R.?

13:15.500 --> 13:16.583
IT WASN'T YOUR PATIENT.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.375
THEY FOUND SARAH?

13:18.417 --> 13:20.041
NOT YET, BUT THEY SAY
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.166
WHO WAS IT?

13:21.208 --> 13:23.166
CONTRACT WORKER
ON THE JANITORIAL STAFF.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.375
SINCE HE WASN'T
AN ACTUAL HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE,

13:25.417 --> 13:27.125
IT TOOK A WHILE
TO CONNECT THE DOTS.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.041
HE'S A REGISTERED
SEX OFFENDER.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.375
THEY'RE SURE IT'S HIM?
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

13:31.417 --> 13:34.333
I HEARD FROM A PARAMEDIC.
HE HEARD FROM A COP BUDDY.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.583
I WAS A JERK.

13:35.625 --> 13:39.250
I WAS OUT OF LINE,
AND I'M SORRY.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.625
NO HARD FEELINGS?

13:41.667 --> 13:45.000
JAMES, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.083
(door opens and closes)

13:48.125 --> 13:49.542
(exhales deeply)

13:54.083 --> 13:55.709
YOU HAVE TO WRITE
"WHOLE CUMIN"?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.417
I NEED WHOLE CUMIN.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.375
YEAH, BUT WHY NOT
JUST WRITE "CUMIN"?

13:59.417 --> 14:00.917
YOU AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA
GET TO THE SPICE AISLE

14:00.959 --> 14:04.041
AND SEE "CUMIN" ON THE LIST,
AND ACCIDENTALLY BUY IT GROUND?

14:04.083 --> 14:06.834
WELL, I DON'T NEED GROUND CUMIN,
I NEED WHOLE CUMIN...

14:06.875 --> 14:08.709
WHICH IS WHY I'M WRITING
"WHOLE CUMIN."

14:08.750 --> 14:11.041
(door opens)

14:11.083 --> 14:12.417
(man) MIRANDA?

14:18.417 --> 14:21.834
(whirring)

14:21.875 --> 14:23.417
(Nick) I THOUGHT ABOUT
CANCELING TODAY,

14:23.458 --> 14:26.375
'CAUSE I'M GOOD.
REALLY GOOD.

14:26.417 --> 14:27.667
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU?

14:27.709 --> 14:30.625
YOU KNOW THINGS ABOUT ME
THAT NO ONE ELSE DOES.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.458
SO SHARING MY HAPPINESS
WITH ANYONE ELSE,

14:32.500 --> 14:34.041
THEY DON'T...

14:34.083 --> 14:35.250
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TOOK
FOR YOU TO GET THERE?

14:35.291 --> 14:38.959
EXACTLY. BUT YOU GET IT.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.959
WHAT DO YOU DO?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.208
GUESS.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.000
OH, COME... I'M REALLY
BAD AT GUESSING.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.166
YOU CAN'T BE BAD AT GUESSING.
IT'S NOT A SKILL.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.083
JUST SAY RANDOM THINGS.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.583
OKAY. MUSICIAN?

14:49.625 --> 14:52.625
YEAH. I PLAY
AND TEACH VIOLIN.

14:52.667 --> 14:53.709
HOW'D YOU GUESS THAT?

14:53.750 --> 14:55.417
YOU HAD A VIOLIN
ON YOUR KEYCHAIN.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.208
I SAW IT IN YOUR HAND
AT THE E.R.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.375
THAT WAS AGES AGO.

14:58.417 --> 15:00.375
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EACH OTHER THEN.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.458
WELL, PAYING ATTENTION
TO DETAIL

15:01.500 --> 15:02.834
IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF MY JOB.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.208
WHICH IS?

15:04.250 --> 15:05.875
PSYCHIATRIST.

15:05.917 --> 15:08.000
OH.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.917
YOU TAKE NAPS
ON YOUR COUCH?

15:09.959 --> 15:11.291
YOU KNOW, LATELY I DO.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.792
MY ONCOLOGIST TOLD ME
I'D BE EXHAUSTED, BUT, UH...

15:13.834 --> 15:15.417
IT'S LIKE KINDERGARTEN,
RIGHT?

15:15.458 --> 15:16.583
WELL, I KEEP WAITING
FOR SOMEONE

15:16.625 --> 15:18.458
TO BRING ME
MILK AND COOKIES.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.709
(door opens)

15:19.750 --> 15:21.458
(man) MIRANDA?

15:25.083 --> 15:28.000
(whirring)

15:31.792 --> 15:33.041
(man) Hold still.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.959
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID LAST WEEK

15:35.000 --> 15:37.750
ABOUT DISCONTINUING THERAPY,
SINCE YOU FEEL OKAY.

15:37.792 --> 15:41.041
I DON'T WANT TO.
I LIKE COMING HERE.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.250
IT'S JUST...
WHEN I FEEL GOOD,

15:43.291 --> 15:45.875
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
IF IT'S A CRUTCH.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.291
WELL, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY

15:47.333 --> 15:49.542
HANDLING HAPPINESS
THAN TROUBLE.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.542
THEY FEEL THEY HAVEN'T
EARNED IT.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.083
OH, I-I GET THAT.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.750
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW
I HAVE EVERYTHING

15:55.792 --> 15:57.709
A NORMAL PERSON
COULD EVER WANT, YOU KNOW?

15:57.750 --> 16:00.041
BUT...

16:00.083 --> 16:03.041
GIVEN WHERE WE STARTED,

16:03.083 --> 16:05.917
DO I DESERVE IT?

16:05.959 --> 16:08.375
DIVORCED, THEN BRIEFLY
BACK TOGETHER,

16:08.417 --> 16:10.750
BUT IT...
IT'S DONE NOW.

16:10.792 --> 16:13.583
MINE ASKED ME FOR A DIVORCE
IN AN E-MAIL.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.458
(chuckles) I TAKE IT
YOU DON'T MISS HIM, THEN?

16:16.500 --> 16:19.959
JUST SLEEPING
NEXT TO HIM.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.333
HE HAD A BAD BACK,

16:21.375 --> 16:23.041
AND HE SLEPT ON HIS SIDE
FACING OUT,

16:23.083 --> 16:25.166
AND I'D SLEEP
WITH MY BACK NEXT TO HIS.

16:25.208 --> 16:28.792
NOT QUITE TOUCHING,
BUT CLOSE ENOUGH TO FEEL WARM.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.667
THAT PART WAS NICE.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.208
I DON'T MISS MY EX.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.041
SHE COULDN'T EVER BE...
STILL.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.166
IT FELT LIKE WE ALWAYS HAD TO
BE BUSY DOING SOMETHING,

16:41.208 --> 16:42.834
OR SHE'D GET BORED.

16:44.750 --> 16:48.041
IT'S BETTER TO HAVE SOMEONE
YOU CAN JUST BE ALONE WITH.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.667
YEAH.

16:51.959 --> 16:53.041

18:57.792 --> 18:59.583
LIKE I'M JUST CANCER GUY.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.333
YOU UNDERSTAND.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.375
YEAH, I DO.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.583
YOU KNOW,
EVERY BEGINNING VIOLIN STUDENT

19:07.625 --> 19:10.000
LEARNS TO PLAY
"TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR."

19:10.041 --> 19:12.792
AND AT FIRST, IT'S AWFUL.

19:12.834 --> 19:15.834
AND THEY PLAY IT OVER
AND OVER AND OVER

19:15.875 --> 19:18.291
TILL I DON'T THINK I CAN
LISTEN ONE MORE TIME,

19:18.333 --> 19:20.166
AND THEN IT CLICKS.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.834
THE FINGER PLACEMENT,
THE PRESSURE ON THE BOW.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.291
ONE DAY IT'S NOISE, AND THEN
THE NEXT DAY, IT'S MUSIC.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.417
I LOVE THAT MOMENT.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.291
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS THAT.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.417
YOU DON'T TEACH VIOLIN
ANYMORE?

19:33.834 --> 19:37.166
MY CANCER HAS METASTASIZED.
IT'S IN MY BRAIN.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.834
SO THE RADIATION IS JUST...

19:39.875 --> 19:42.750
I PROMISED MY NIECE I WOULD GO
TO HER COLLEGE GRADUATION.

19:42.792 --> 19:44.917
SO I'M HOLDING ON
AS LONG AS I CAN,

19:44.959 --> 19:48.041
BUT THIS IS JUST DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.417
I'M TERMINAL, SHELDON,

19:50.458 --> 19:52.375
(voice breaks)
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

19:52.417 --> 19:55.583
FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO TALK TO.

19:55.625 --> 19:56.792
(door opens)

19:56.834 --> 19:58.000
MIRANDA?

20:05.250 --> 20:08.250
(whirring)

20:15.000 --> 20:16.792
(man) Hold still.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.917
UGH. HOW AM I GONNA
SIGN PAYROLL NEXT WEEK?

20:24.959 --> 20:27.834
NEED ONE OF THOSE ASTRONAUT PENS
THAT WRITES UPSIDE-DOWN.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.166
MAKES YOUR HEAD HURT, TOO.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.417
MASON TRIED LAYING LIKE THIS
ON THE SOFA AT HOME.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.208
OH. HOW LONG
DID YOU MAKE IT?

20:34.250 --> 20:35.500
TEN MINUTES,

20:35.542 --> 20:37.083
THEN I THOUGHT MY BRAINS
WERE GONNA EXPLODE.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.500
(laughs)
DAD ONLY MADE IT FIVE.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.083
WELL, CLEARLY,
THE MAN IS WEAK.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.417
I'M GONNA GO
TO THE VENDING MACHINE.

20:43.458 --> 20:44.667
YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING?

20:44.709 --> 20:46.125
MNH-MNH.
NO, THANK YOU.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.041
HEY.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.542
COME RIGHT BACK.

20:55.125 --> 20:57.458
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.333
UGH. HOW DO YOU THINK?

20:59.375 --> 21:01.166
I'M ALREADY JUMPING
OUT OF MY SKIN,

21:01.208 --> 21:02.458
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.041
I GOT TWO MORE MONTHS LAYING
HERE LIKE A SACK OF POTATOES.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.041
IF I EVEN THINK
ABOUT GETTING UP TO PEE,

21:07.083 --> 21:08.417
THERE'S A WHOLE CHORUS
OF "HOLD STILL,"

21:08.458 --> 21:10.041
LIKE THE WORLD'S
GONNA COME TO AN END

21:10.083 --> 21:11.083
IF I MOVE HALF AN INCH.

21:11.125 --> 21:14.041
IT'S NO FUN, SHELDON,
STAYING IN ONE SPOT,

21:14.083 --> 21:16.625
CONTEMPLATING EVERY BAD THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN

21:16.667 --> 21:19.542
ON A CONTINUOUS LOOP.
IT'S...

21:19.583 --> 21:22.041
OH, IT'S NO FUN.

21:22.083 --> 21:24.709
I GET THAT. I DO.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.041
SHELDON...

21:26.083 --> 21:29.041
YOU HAVE AN ABUNDANCE
OF EMPATHY,

21:29.083 --> 21:31.750
BUT HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
IMAGINE WHAT THIS IS LIKE?

21:34.166 --> 21:36.041
WELL, THIS MORNING...

21:36.083 --> 21:38.542
WELL, EVERY MORNING
FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS,

21:38.583 --> 21:40.625
I-I--I'VE BEEN GOING...

21:43.500 --> 21:46.291
TO THE GYM, AND I USE
A STATIONARY BIKE,

21:46.333 --> 21:48.250
AND YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST DON'T GET ANYWHERE,

21:48.291 --> 21:49.917
NO MATTER HOW HARD
YOU PEDAL.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.083
AND I'M NOT LOSING
ANY WEIGHT.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.750
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

21:52.792 --> 21:55.000
SO YOU DO UNDERSTAND.

21:55.041 --> 21:58.083
YOU'RE RIGHT. I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS LIKE.

21:58.125 --> 22:01.041
BUT YOU'RE
THE STRONGEST PERSON I KNOW.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.834
AND JUST BEING AROUND YOU,
I...

22:03.875 --> 22:08.000
I THINK IT GIVES ME
STRENGTH, TOO.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.333
(chuckles)

22:16.166 --> 22:18.166
YOU'RE LATE.

22:18.208 --> 22:22.041
YEAH. TRAFFIC.

22:22.083 --> 22:25.291
SO I WAS THINKING OF TRYING
THIS LUNCH PLACE DOWN THE STREET

22:25.333 --> 22:27.417
THAT HAS SALADS WITH
REALLY MOTIVATIONAL NAMES,

22:27.458 --> 22:31.250
LIKE "YOU CAN CONQUER ANYTHING"
AND "IT'S NEVER TOO LATE."

22:33.125 --> 22:34.750
LET ME KNOW
IF IT'S ANY GOOD.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.583
(door opens)

22:40.625 --> 22:42.083
(man) MIRANDA?

22:50.083 --> 22:53.667
(whirring)

22:53.709 --> 22:55.000
(clicks)

22:55.041 --> 22:57.041
(man) Hold still.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.041
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO LUNCH
WITH MIRANDA?

22:59.083 --> 23:02.041
OUR FRIENDSHIP DOESN'T GO
OUTSIDE THAT ROOM.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.041
THAT'S THE RULE.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.125
I THINK IT'S ALREADY
OUTSIDE THAT ROOM,

23:05.166 --> 23:07.000
AND YOU KNOW IT.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.041
SHE TOLD ME
SHE'S TERMINAL.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.041
AHA.

23:13.083 --> 23:15.041
WHAT "AHA"?

23:15.083 --> 23:17.041
NOT EVERYONE
HAS THE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER

23:17.083 --> 23:18.792
TO GO THROUGH THIS
WITH SOMEONE.

23:18.834 --> 23:21.041
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
WE DISCUSSED WITH LAURA.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.500
WELL, I'M NOT LAURA.
LAURA WAS SELFISH.

23:23.542 --> 23:25.041
OR SCARED.

23:25.083 --> 23:27.041
GETTING CLOSER TO SOMEONE
WHO'S SICK IS TERRIFYING.

23:27.083 --> 23:28.375
NO, IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING.

23:28.417 --> 23:30.375
LAURA AND I
HAVE A 20-YEAR HISTORY.

23:30.417 --> 23:33.041
I MET MIRANDA
SEVEN WEEKS AGO.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.291
WE SPEND FIVE MINUTES A DAY
TOGETHER FIVE DAYS A WEEK,

23:35.333 --> 23:38.291
AND OUR--OUR FRIENDSHIP
IS, UH...

23:38.333 --> 23:39.875
THREE HOURS OLD.

23:39.917 --> 23:42.041
AND YET, THE EXPERIENCES
YOU'RE SHARING--

23:42.083 --> 23:44.875
THAT CREATES A DEEPER BOND
THAN YOU WOULD NORMALLY HAVE

23:44.917 --> 23:46.959
WITH SOMEONE YOU'VE KNOWN
FOR THREE HOURS.

23:49.542 --> 23:51.709
I LIKE HER.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.083
BUT I...

23:55.667 --> 23:57.417
I CAN'T TAKE THE NEXT STEP.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.083
WHY?

23:59.125 --> 24:01.208
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

24:04.083 --> 24:06.000
EVERYTHING.

24:10.083 --> 24:11.333
HOW ARE RON AND DANA?

24:11.375 --> 24:13.250
IMAGINATIONS
ARE RUNNING WILD.

24:13.291 --> 24:14.792
HOW COULD THEY NOT?

24:14.834 --> 24:15.959
THE GUY IN CUSTODY
HAD THEIR DAUGHTER

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
FOR HOW MANY DAYS
BEFORE HE WAS ARRESTED?

24:18.041 --> 24:19.583
54.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.291
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT
COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HER...

24:21.333 --> 24:22.500
I DON'T WANNA.

24:22.542 --> 24:23.750
WELL, PEOPLE ARE STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK.

24:23.792 --> 24:25.500
AND KIDS CAN SURVIVE
MOST ANYTHING

24:25.542 --> 24:27.792
IF THEY GET
THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP.
WELL, TO BE HELPED,

24:27.834 --> 24:30.041
SARAH HAS TO
ACTUALLY BE FOUND,

24:30.083 --> 24:31.667
YOU KNOW, ALIVE.

24:31.709 --> 24:33.041
AND WHO'S TO SAY
THE GUY IN CUSTODY

24:33.083 --> 24:34.291
IS EVEN THE ONE
WHO TOOK SARAH?

24:34.333 --> 24:36.125
(Cooper) THE GUY DID IT BEFORE.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

24:36.166 --> 24:38.041
HE SHOULD BE TORTURED WHETHER
IT HELPS FIND SARAH OR NOT.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.458
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SERIOUS.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.083
YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT MASON,
I GOT TWO ON THE WAY,

24:41.125 --> 24:42.250
I HAVE A BABY
IN THE NICU

24:42.291 --> 24:43.792
WHO'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY.

24:43.834 --> 24:45.583
I HAVE NO SYMPATHY
FOR A PEDOPHILE. I'M SORRY.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.917
I LIKE VIGILANTE COOP.
WHERE'D HE COME FROM?

24:47.959 --> 24:50.166
VIGILANTE COOP IS JUST A GUY
WHO PUT A BID IN ON A HOUSE

24:50.208 --> 24:52.291
AND THEN HE CHECKED
THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.625
YOU KNOW HOW MANY LIVE
WITHIN A 5-MILE RADIUS

24:54.667 --> 24:56.959
OF OUR DREAM HOUSE?
SIX.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.959
AND THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES
THAT ARE REGISTERED.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.625
FOUR BLOCKS AWAY,
THERE'S A GUY THAT DID TIME

25:00.667 --> 25:02.625
FOR SEXUAL PENETRATION
WITH A--
OH, STOP. STOP, COOP.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.583
NO, COOPER'S RIGHT.

25:04.625 --> 25:07.041
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE
MORE OF THEM RIGHT NOW,

25:07.083 --> 25:10.750
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK
IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT IT.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.417
THEY HAVE A DISEASE,
THEY WANT OUR SUPPORT,

25:12.458 --> 25:14.125
THEY WANT OUR HELP,
THEY WANT US TO TELL THEM

25:14.166 --> 25:15.709
THAT GOD
DIDN'T MAKE THEM WRONG.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.041
BUT I MEAN,
HOW CAN WE DO THAT?

25:18.083 --> 25:20.875
THERE'S SOME MALADIES THAT
ARE SIMPLY CONTRARY TO NATURE,

25:20.917 --> 25:22.041
AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

25:22.083 --> 25:24.041
THAT NO LOVING GOD
WOULD PUT ON THIS EARTH

25:24.083 --> 25:25.667
UNLESS IT WAS TO DEMONSTRATE
TO THE REST OF US

25:25.709 --> 25:28.041
THAT THERE WAS A LIMIT
TO HUMANITY

25:28.083 --> 25:30.000
AND PATIENCE
AND COMPASSION...

25:30.041 --> 25:34.333
WHICH FURTHER JUSTIFIES
MY UTTER LACK OF FAITH.

25:34.375 --> 25:35.959
THE ONLY LIFE
SOME PEOPLE DESERVE

25:36.000 --> 25:37.166
IS A LIFE SENTENCE.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.875
AND YET,
WE HELP THEM LIVE FREELY,

25:39.917 --> 25:41.458
AND WHILE WE DO THAT,

25:41.500 --> 25:44.250
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

25:54.291 --> 25:57.542
NICK, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

26:00.083 --> 26:02.041
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU IMAGINE SOMETHING, AND...

26:02.083 --> 26:04.417
IN THE BEGINNING
IT FEELS AMAZING,

26:04.458 --> 26:07.917
BUT THEN SLOWLY,
THE REALITY SETS IN.

26:07.959 --> 26:10.041
IT JUST ISN'T
WHAT YOU PLANNED.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.291
IS THIS ABOUT ALYSSA?

26:11.333 --> 26:13.792
I THOUGHT IT WAS LOVE.

26:13.834 --> 26:18.041
BUT REAL LOVE...
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GROW,

26:18.083 --> 26:22.041
RIGHT, OVER TIME?

26:22.083 --> 26:24.417
(exhales) ONE HOPES.

26:24.458 --> 26:28.041
WELL, IT'S NOT GROWING
FOR ME.

26:28.083 --> 26:31.458
SHE JUST DOESN'T SEEM HAPPY,
NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.041
MAYBE THIS WASN'T
MEANT TO BE.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.542
EVERY RELATIONSHIP
IS EXCITING AT THE START.

26:39.583 --> 26:41.542
THE PERSON YOU'RE WITH
IS A BLANK CANVAS,

26:41.583 --> 26:43.542
AND EVERYTHING IS NEW.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.417
OF COURSE, THE NOVELTY FADES,
AND SOMETIMES

26:45.458 --> 26:47.542
YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THAT RELATIONSHIP TIME,

26:47.583 --> 26:49.041
YOU KNOW,
TO--TO REALLY KNOW--

26:49.083 --> 26:51.500
MAYBE LOVE JUST ISN'T
IN THE CARDS FOR ME.

26:51.542 --> 26:54.667
NICK, YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN.

26:54.709 --> 26:57.000
THE SEARCH
FOR THE RIGHT WOMAN...

27:01.000 --> 27:02.792
ALYSSA'S NOT HER.

27:02.834 --> 27:08.875
AND, UH...
I DON'T WANNA HURT HER, BUT...

27:08.917 --> 27:11.000
I THINK I HAVE TO END IT.

27:29.083 --> 27:32.000
(violin music playing)

27:45.375 --> 27:48.375
♪♪♪

28:02.792 --> 28:04.041
THE SARAH NELSON CASE.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.709
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
THE WRONG MAN IN CUSTODY.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.000
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

28:07.041 --> 28:08.834
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
ON YOUR SUSPECT?

28:08.875 --> 28:10.542
WELL, HE'S A REGISTERED
SEX OFFENDER.

28:10.583 --> 28:12.583
DID IT AT LEAST
ONCE BEFORE.

28:12.625 --> 28:15.041
SAME TYPE--
BLONDE, BLUE EYES...

28:15.083 --> 28:17.333
THEY ALL HAVE A TYPE.

28:17.375 --> 28:20.458
FOUR WITNESSES PUT HIM
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM

28:20.500 --> 28:23.375
MOPPING FLOORS MINUTES
BEFORE THE GIRL WENT MISSING.

28:23.417 --> 28:25.792
AND THAT WAS TEN MINUTES
AFTER HIS SHIFT WAS OVER.
(coffee pouring)

28:25.834 --> 28:27.041
THAT'S EVIDENCE?

28:27.083 --> 28:28.750
BEEN A COP 30 YEARS,
SHELLEY.

28:28.792 --> 28:31.250
HE'S A LOWLIFE,
THROUGH AND THROUGH.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.250
YEAH, BUT... (sighs)
BUT HE HASN'T CONFESSED.

28:33.291 --> 28:34.583
WHY WOULD HE?

28:34.625 --> 28:37.208
WE GOT HIM ON FELONY POSSESSION
OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY

28:37.250 --> 28:39.041
AND PAROLE VIOLATION.

28:39.083 --> 28:40.166
HE'S NOT GONNA ADD LIFE
ON TOP OF THAT

28:40.208 --> 28:42.458
JUST TO HELP US
WITH OUR INVESTIGATION.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.041
(exhales) ALL RIGHT.

28:44.083 --> 28:45.667
ALL RIGHT.

28:45.709 --> 28:47.041
I'M BREAKING PROTOCOL,

28:47.083 --> 28:48.041
I'M BREAKING PROBABLY
THE LAW,

28:48.083 --> 28:49.458
AND I'M RISKING MY...

28:49.500 --> 28:51.875
I'M RISKING MY LICENSE
BY SAYING THIS,

28:51.917 --> 28:54.500
BUT I COUNT YOU
AS A FRIEND, JOE.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.417
(sets down mug)

28:56.458 --> 28:57.875
ALL RIGHT.

28:57.917 --> 28:59.667
I HAD A PATIENT WHO WAS
AT THE HOSPITAL THAT NIGHT,

28:59.709 --> 29:01.041
AND... I THINK
HE TOOK SARAH.

29:01.083 --> 29:03.083
HE HAS A HISTORY
OF SEXUAL URGES TOWARD CHILDREN.

29:03.125 --> 29:05.041
HAS HE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THE GIRL?
NO, NO, NO.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.000
HE'S TOO SMART.
YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS THE RULES.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.417
BUT HE WAS IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE,

29:08.458 --> 29:10.500
AND NOW HE'S HAVING MOOD SWINGS
BECAUSE IT WENT BAD,

29:10.542 --> 29:12.291
AND I THINK
IF THAT SOMEONE IS SARAH,

29:12.333 --> 29:14.041
HE COULD BE GETTING READY
TO HURT HER.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.041
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME ANYTHING
TO GO ON HERE, SHELLEY.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.208
I CAN'T BUST DOWN THE DOOR
TO A GUY'S HOUSE

29:18.250 --> 29:19.417
WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.291
JOE, COME ON.
I-I JUST HAVE A FEELING.

29:21.333 --> 29:22.625
A FEELING?

29:22.667 --> 29:24.417
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE A SHRINK,
BUT COME ON.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.083
SHE'S OUT THERE.
HE COULD HAVE HER. HE...

29:27.125 --> 29:28.458
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

29:28.500 --> 29:32.041
LOOK, THE BEST WE CAN HOPE NOW
IS TO FIND HER BODY

29:32.083 --> 29:34.083
SO THAT THE PARENTS
HAVE SOMETHING TO BURY.

29:34.125 --> 29:37.375
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON HER.

29:39.500 --> 29:42.375
I'M SORRY, SHELLEY.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.458
(telephone ringing in distance)

29:52.500 --> 29:54.500
NICK. HEY.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.917
THANKS FOR
COMING BACK SO SOON.

29:56.959 --> 29:58.500
I-I HAVE TO LEAVE TOWN
NEXT WEEK,

29:58.542 --> 30:00.166
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
WE DIDN'T MISS AN APPOINTMENT.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.041
NO PROBLEM.
OKAY.

30:02.083 --> 30:04.792
SO DID YOU... DID YOU HAVE
ANY TROUBLE GETTING HERE?
(elevator bell dings)

30:04.834 --> 30:07.583
'CAUSE TRAFFIC CAN BE HEAVY
THIS TIME OF DAY.

30:07.625 --> 30:09.834
NO. NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

30:14.542 --> 30:15.750
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
IN MY OFFICE?

30:15.792 --> 30:17.375
AND I'LL, UH,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

30:17.417 --> 30:18.333
SURE.

30:18.375 --> 30:20.000
OKAY.

30:21.834 --> 30:25.583
(telephone rings)

30:25.625 --> 30:28.375
COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE THIS CALL
IN 15 MINUTES?

30:28.417 --> 30:32.041
OKAY. IT'S IMPORTANT.
THANK YOU.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.041
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH ALYSSA?

30:41.083 --> 30:43.041
OH, THE SAME.

30:43.083 --> 30:44.792
SO YOU DIDN'T END IT?

30:44.834 --> 30:46.709
NOT YET.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.041
(inhales)

30:48.083 --> 30:50.083
(exhales deeply)

30:50.125 --> 30:53.041
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT COUPLE
IN THE LOBBY--

30:53.083 --> 30:55.166
THIS IS
HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL,

30:55.208 --> 30:57.125
BUT I AM...
I'M DISTRACTED.

30:57.166 --> 30:58.375
WHY?

30:58.417 --> 30:59.959
WELL, THEY WERE THE PARENTS

31:00.000 --> 31:02.792
OF THAT LITTLE GIRL THAT WENT
MISSING FROM THE E.R.

31:02.834 --> 31:04.250
"WERE"?
WHAT?

31:04.291 --> 31:06.125
YOU SAID THEY "WERE"
THE PARENTS

31:06.166 --> 31:08.667
OF THAT MISSING GIRL,
BUT...

31:08.709 --> 31:11.166
THEY'RE STILL HER PARENTS.
WELL, NOT IF SHE'S DEAD.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.458
WELL, YEAH,
BUT MAYBE SHE'S OKAY.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.125
MAYBE SHE'S DOING
EVEN BETTER.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.125
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

31:16.166 --> 31:18.417
I WAS THERE THAT NIGHT.

31:18.458 --> 31:19.875
THOSE PARENTS ARE AWFUL.

31:19.917 --> 31:22.041
FIGHTING LIKE THAT
IN FRONT OF HER?

31:22.083 --> 31:24.750
THAT'S... THAT'S NO WAY
FOR A KID TO LIVE.

31:24.792 --> 31:27.291
KIDS NEED TO BE LOVED.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.041
YES, THEY DO.
YEAH.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.166
THEY ABSOLUTELY DO.

31:31.208 --> 31:33.208
SO YOU THINK MAYBE
SHE'S STILL ALIVE?

31:33.250 --> 31:35.208
SARAH?

31:35.250 --> 31:36.458
YES.

31:36.500 --> 31:40.000
I DO.
I THINK SHE'S OKAY.

31:41.834 --> 31:44.083
I CAN'T SIT HOME ANYMORE
AND JUST WAIT.

31:44.125 --> 31:45.291
I CAN'T DO IT.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.417
WELL, I CAN'T PRETEND
THAT WE NEVER HAD A KID.

31:47.458 --> 31:48.417
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M DOING.

31:48.458 --> 31:49.917
DANA, THIS ISN'T HELPING.

31:49.959 --> 31:51.375
PLEASE, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:51.417 --> 31:53.250
WE HAVE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE.
WE HAVE TO EAT.

31:53.291 --> 31:56.000
HE WENT BACK TO WORK.
OUR BABY IS MISSING,

31:56.041 --> 31:58.041
AND HE IS TREATING IT
LIKE IT'S A REGULAR DAY.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.625
RIGHT, BUT WE HAVE
DISCUSSED THIS.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.333
EVEN THOUGH TWO PEOPLE
SHARE THE SAME LOSS,

32:02.375 --> 32:05.208
THEY MAY NOT EXPERIENCE OR DEAL
WITH GRIEF THE SAME WAY.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.041
EXACTLY.
AND FOR A FEW HOURS A DAY

32:07.083 --> 32:08.417
WHEN I'M IN COURT,
I CAN FORGET.

32:08.458 --> 32:12.667
WELL, I CAN'T, AND I WON'T.

32:12.709 --> 32:16.041
DANA, SHE'S DEAD.

32:16.083 --> 32:19.250
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

32:19.291 --> 32:20.709
I JUST NEEDED
TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.542
I... CAN'T WALK AROUND
ON EGGSHELLS ANYMORE

32:23.583 --> 32:26.041
AND PRETEND TO HOPE.
I... I'M NOT HOPEFUL.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.458
DR. TURNER,
YOU ARE A MOTHER.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.208
YOU TELL HIM HE IS WRONG.

32:29.250 --> 32:32.041
WELL, WE JUST...
WE DON'T KNOW.

32:32.083 --> 32:35.041
I KNOW.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.083
A MOTHER KNOWS.

32:37.125 --> 32:39.291
SARAH IS ALIVE.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.375
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.125
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:43.166 --> 32:44.750
YOUR DEPRESSION.

32:44.792 --> 32:46.959
I'M NOT DEPRESSED.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.083
I JUST SAID MY RELATIONSHIP
ISN'T WORKING.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.375
WELL, YOU CAME TO ME
IN THE BEGINNING

32:50.417 --> 32:51.667
BECAUSE YOU WANTED HELP,

32:51.709 --> 32:54.000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT YOU ARE.

32:54.041 --> 32:56.333
WHAT I AM?

32:56.375 --> 32:59.041
YOU SAID
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

32:59.083 --> 33:00.041
THE URGES
AREN'T YOUR FAULT,

33:00.083 --> 33:01.667
BUT ACTING ON THEM
WOULD BE.

33:01.709 --> 33:04.959
YOU'D BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.750
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF SOMETHING?

33:06.792 --> 33:08.375
NO. NO, I'M JUST
ASKING YOU TO BE HONEST,

33:08.417 --> 33:10.291
BECAUSE OUR DEAL,
AFTER I SAVED YOUR LIFE,

33:10.333 --> 33:12.125
WAS... NO MORE SECRETS.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.417
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO SAVE MY LIFE.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.333
YOU TOOK A BOTTLE OF PILLS
AND CAME TO MY OFFICE, NICK--

33:15.375 --> 33:17.041
A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.291
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WOULD HAPPEN?

33:18.333 --> 33:21.041
I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE ALONE
WHEN I DIED.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.125
YOU KNOW,
THE TERMS THAT WE DISCUSSED

33:22.166 --> 33:23.625
FOR MY CONTINUING
TO HELP YOU--

33:23.667 --> 33:26.291
THE ONLY REQUIREMENT
WAS YOUR HONESTY.

33:26.333 --> 33:28.000
I'VE BEEN HONEST.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.333
WHO'S ALYSSA?

33:32.375 --> 33:34.333
THE WOMAN I'VE BEEN SEEING.

33:34.375 --> 33:35.583
WHERE'S SHE FROM?

33:35.625 --> 33:36.834
HERE.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.041
WHAT DOES SHE DO?

33:38.083 --> 33:40.083
SHE'S, UM... A WAITRESS.

33:40.125 --> 33:43.083
I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS.

33:43.125 --> 33:44.208
WHERE DOES SHE LIVE, NICK?

33:44.250 --> 33:46.750
VENICE.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.041
DO YOU HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH?

33:48.083 --> 33:49.333
NO.
NOT EVEN ON YOUR PHONE?

33:49.375 --> 33:52.000
WHAT COLOR ARE HER EYES?
ARE THEY BLUE?

33:52.041 --> 33:54.125
AND HER HAIR BLONDE, TOO,
LIKE SARAH?

33:54.166 --> 33:57.041
BECAUSE THERE IS NO ALYSSA.
IT'S ONLY SARAH,

33:57.083 --> 33:58.041
AND YOU TOOK HER.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.709
AND THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.792
SARAH IS DEAD, OKAY?

34:03.834 --> 34:05.542
AND YOU KEEP ENCOURAGING HER
TO HOPE, DR. TURNER.

34:05.583 --> 34:08.166
IT'S GONNA KILL HER.
I DON'T KNOW THAT, RON.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.125
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
THEY HAVE THE GUY
IN CUSTODY.

34:10.166 --> 34:12.208
THAT'S WHAT THE DETECTIVE SAID.
HE'S THE GUY.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.041
AND IF THEY DIDN'T FIND SARAH
AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS,

34:14.083 --> 34:16.000
THE ODDS THAT THEY WERE
EVER GONNA FIND HER ALIVE--

34:16.041 --> 34:18.291
THE DETECTIVE DOESN'T KNOW
OUR BABY. HE DOESN'T KNOW US.

34:18.333 --> 34:21.041
IT IS JUST A JOB TO HIM.
HE IS ON TO THE NEXT CASE.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.250
WE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE
SUPPOSED TO KEEP CARING.

34:23.291 --> 34:25.500
I'M THE ONLY ONE CARING!

34:25.542 --> 34:27.250
DANA, RON CARES. HE CARES.

34:27.291 --> 34:28.291
OF COURSE I CARE!

34:28.333 --> 34:30.417
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
IF SHE'S ALIVE?

34:30.458 --> 34:32.166
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

34:32.208 --> 34:35.000
WHAT HE MUST HAVE DONE
TO HER?

34:35.041 --> 34:37.458
ALL THOSE NIGHTS THAT YOU
SAT THERE TAKING PILLS,

34:37.500 --> 34:39.291
I WAS AWAKE
STARING AT THE WALL,

34:39.333 --> 34:41.709
AND I COULDN'T STOP
IMAGINING...

34:41.750 --> 34:45.041
IN YOUR DREAMS, YOU COULD HEAR
SARAH ASKING TO BAKE CUPCAKES.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.709
BUT ALL I COULD HEAR
WAS HER SCREAMING...

34:47.750 --> 34:51.083
(voice breaking) SCREAMING
FOR DADDY TO COME SAVE HER.

34:51.125 --> 34:53.834
I NEED TO THINK
THAT SHE'S DEAD, DANA,

34:53.875 --> 34:56.041
BECAUSE OTHERWISE...

34:56.083 --> 34:57.709
(crying) OH, MY GOD,
I CAN'T EVEN...

34:57.750 --> 35:00.041
YOU ARE WRONG.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.417
HER PARENTS FOUGHT
AND SHE RAN AWAY,

35:01.458 --> 35:02.875
AND WHEN YOU LEFT
THE E.R. THAT NIGHT,

35:02.917 --> 35:04.250
YOU FOUND HER OUTSIDE,
DIDN'T YOU?

35:04.291 --> 35:06.041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:06.083 --> 35:09.250
SHE WAS UPSET, SCARED,
PROBABLY HIDING FROM THE RAIN.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.458
I MEAN, WHAT DID YOU DO?
DID YOU CHARM HER?

35:10.500 --> 35:11.625
DID YOU BUY HER SOMETHING?

35:11.667 --> 35:13.041
HOW DID YOU GET HER
TO GO HOME WITH YOU?

35:13.083 --> 35:15.041
YOU'RE CRAZY.
I GET IT, NICK. I DO.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.208
YOU WANTED TO GIVE HER
A BETTER LIFE.

35:16.250 --> 35:17.500
I MEAN, THAT'S IT,
ISN'T IT?

35:17.542 --> 35:19.125
WHY WOULD I KEEP COMING HERE
IF I TOOK HER?

35:19.166 --> 35:20.709
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.291
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO TELL ME.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.542
JUST LIKE YOU WANTED
TO SHARE YOUR JOY WITH ME,

35:24.583 --> 35:25.750
AND NOW YOU WANT TO CONFESS,

35:25.792 --> 35:28.041
BECAUSE THE URGES,
THEY GOT TO BE TOO MUCH.

35:28.083 --> 35:29.959
YOU COULDN'T STOP YOURSELF.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.291
YOU NEVER THOUGHT
YOU COULD HELP ME.
BUT SHE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.792
HOW COULD SHE?
SHE'S A CHILD.

35:33.834 --> 35:35.291
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE WITH YOU.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.041
AND MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO BE A MAN WITH HER.

35:37.083 --> 35:38.250
MAYBE YOU COULDN'T PERFORM,

35:38.291 --> 35:40.083
AND MAYBE THAT'S
WHY YOU'RE DEPRESSED.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.083
GOD, YOU'RE GUESSING!

35:41.125 --> 35:44.041
YOU'RE... YOU'RE GUESSING.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.041
YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP
AS YOU GO ALONG.

35:46.083 --> 35:49.125
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

35:49.166 --> 35:52.041
YOU'RE POWERLESS.

35:52.083 --> 35:55.083
YOU ARE POWERLESS
AND WEAK.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.041
WHERE IS SHE?

35:57.083 --> 35:59.041
I HAVE NO IDEA.

35:59.083 --> 36:00.166
WHERE IS SHE?!

36:00.208 --> 36:02.125
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.041
HE'S ACUTELY SUICIDAL
AND COMBATIVE.
WHAT THE HELL?

36:10.083 --> 36:11.709
HE'S PARANOID
AND EXTERNALIZING,

36:11.750 --> 36:14.041
SO EXPECT ACCUSATIONS
OF PERSECUTION.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:14.083 --> 36:16.625
NOW HE IS SLEEP-DEPRIVED,
SO WE'LL NEED ONE-ON-ONES

36:16.667 --> 36:18.083
UNTIL HE CAN BE
HEAVILY SEDATED.
(clicking)

36:18.125 --> 36:20.333
SEDATED? NO, I'M NOT SUICIDAL.
I'M TOTALLY--I'M FINE.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.083
I'LL FOLLOW UP DIRECTLY
WITH THE INTAKE DOCTOR.

36:22.125 --> 36:24.709
WE'RE PUTTING YOU ON
A 5150 PSYCH HOLD, OKAY?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.333
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

36:26.375 --> 36:30.583
NO, NO, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING!

36:30.625 --> 36:33.041
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, NICK.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.166
SHELLEY, I JUST DID A DOUBLE.
I'M GOING HOME.

36:40.208 --> 36:41.375
MY PATIENT, NICK CALHOUN,
HAS SARAH.

36:41.417 --> 36:43.208
HE TOOK HER AND HE HAS HER
AT HIS HOUSE.

36:43.250 --> 36:45.041
SO WHAT CHANGED
SINCE THIS MORNING, HUH?

36:45.083 --> 36:46.333
YOU GET SOME PROOF?

36:46.375 --> 36:47.583
NO, I'M TELLING YOU
I KNOW.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.417
HOW? DID YOU SEE HER
AT HIS HOUSE?

36:49.458 --> 36:52.041
DID HE TELL YOU
THAT HE HAS HER?

36:52.083 --> 36:55.875
YES. HE TOLD ME.
NICK CONFESSED.

36:58.709 --> 36:59.667
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

36:59.709 --> 37:00.917
HE'S 5150.

37:00.959 --> 37:01.959
YOU HAD HIM COMMITTED?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.583
HE WAS IN DANGER
OF HURTING HIMSELF.

37:03.625 --> 37:05.792
OR SOMEONE ELSE.
YES.

37:05.834 --> 37:08.291
THAT'S PROBABLE CAUSE.
LET'S GO.

37:08.333 --> 37:10.250
OKAY.

37:10.291 --> 37:13.000
(door cracks, wood clatters)

37:19.083 --> 37:20.667
(man) LIVING ROOM CLEAR!

37:22.208 --> 37:23.709
(man) KITCHEN CLEAR!

37:25.458 --> 37:26.667
(man) BEDROOM CLEAR!

37:26.709 --> 37:28.041
SHELLEY?

37:28.083 --> 37:31.250
SHE'S HERE. SHE...
SHE HAS TO BE HERE.

37:31.291 --> 37:34.000
THERE'S A BASEMENT.

37:35.375 --> 37:36.959
(cracks)

37:45.250 --> 37:46.959
(clatters)

38:00.250 --> 38:02.667
(crying)

38:02.709 --> 38:06.166
(lowered voice) SHE'S
UNDER THERE. FIND THE LIGHTS.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.709
HI, SARAH.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.250
MY NAME IS SHELDON.
I'M HERE WITH THE POLICE.

38:14.291 --> 38:18.041
AND WE'RE--WE'RE GONNA
TAKE YOU HOME, OKAY?

38:18.083 --> 38:21.291
IS HE...
IS HE COMING BACK?

38:21.333 --> 38:24.667
NO. NO, SWEETIE.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
