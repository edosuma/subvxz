WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.434
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...
I now pronounce you

00:02.436 --> 00:03.736
husband and wife.

00:03.738 --> 00:07.773
(applause)

00:07.775 --> 00:09.541
I fired you

00:09.543 --> 00:11.243
because I'm in love with you.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.779
I'm in love with you, too.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.447
I don't know what to do
with that information.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.316
I have an idea.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.418
(gasps)

00:19.420 --> 00:20.386
Guess Paige is
back on the team.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.720
I know this is
not a good time,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.022
but we have a case.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.623
The government
of French Polynesia

00:24.625 --> 00:26.191
needs help setting up

00:26.193 --> 00:28.694
their underwater
wave-powered generators.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.262
They're willing
to fly us

00:30.264 --> 00:31.330
to Tahiti, meaning...

00:31.332 --> 00:32.498
Free honeymoon.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.033
SCOTTY:
Our copilot is sick.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.734
We're looking at
a minimum of four hours, okay?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.102
HAPPY:
Nope.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.638
Got a multi-engine
commercial license.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.674
Are there any other secrets
about you that I should know,

00:42.676 --> 00:44.109
my beautiful bride?

00:44.111 --> 00:44.743
Probably.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.513
(thuds and rattling)

00:47.515 --> 00:49.248
Something's wrong, I can tell.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.834
We've lost power.

00:51.835 --> 00:53.251
Buckle up and brace yourselves;
we're going down.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.288
(engine whirring)

00:57.658 --> 00:59.525
Nothing's getting
the power back up.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.393
Hydraulics, too,
they're shot.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.496
I can keep her steady as we lose
altitude, but no more than that.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.832
We are on pure glide
back to earth at 120 knots.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.267
We need a plan!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.802
I can't hack
into plane's controls.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.603
Tablet's dead.
Cell phones, too!

01:11.605 --> 01:13.539
That loud boom
must've been an EMP.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.741
It came from the back.
Guys, move out the way.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.142
I'm gonna open the hatch.

01:17.144 --> 01:19.178
(grunting)

01:24.385 --> 01:26.118
WALTER:
Oh.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.852
Look, one of the batteries
for the wave-powered generators.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.189
People use batteries every day--
why did that one explode?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.491
They're designed to charge
via ocean current.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.626
But this one must've mistaken
the turbulence in the flight

01:34.628 --> 01:36.161
for motion of the sea.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.863
SYLVESTER:
So it turned on, charged up

01:37.865 --> 01:39.164
and overheated till it blew.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.265
This is the last time
we take a job

01:40.267 --> 01:41.667
using third-party equipment.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.268
This might be the last time
we take a job at all!

01:43.270 --> 01:44.336
Keep it positive.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.838
SCOTTY:
We're at 45,000 feet

01:45.840 --> 01:47.639
and dropping fast.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.208
Sounds negative to me!

01:49.210 --> 01:50.409
Walt, I hate
to state the obvious,

01:50.411 --> 01:52.344
but an EMP
will not kill the hydraulics.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.846
You need to get
eyes on what did!

01:53.848 --> 01:55.347
I'm already searching.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.850
Oh, I found it!

01:57.852 --> 02:00.152
One of the Pelican cases
is being held against the wall,

02:00.154 --> 02:01.787
a few feet up in the air.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.355
That can only be from suction.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.723
Which means, when the
battery exploded,

02:04.725 --> 02:05.858
it sent shrapnel
through the wall

02:05.860 --> 02:07.426
going to the forward
compartment.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.695
That's where the hydraulics are;
shrapnel cut the lines.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.263
No fluid, no hydraulics.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.431
And no hydraulics, no control.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.399
If that case wasn't
blocking that hole,

02:14.401 --> 02:15.834
depressurization would kill us.

02:15.836 --> 02:16.869
Earth's surface
is gonna handle that

02:16.871 --> 02:18.403
in a matter of minutes.

02:18.405 --> 02:19.771
Not if we get the
hydraulics up and running.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.306
We have the world's
smartest engineer on board.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.708
SCOTTY: If you can
patch the line,

02:22.710 --> 02:25.310
I might be able
to land this bird safe.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.479
I can't open the hydraulics
compartment; it's depressurized.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.647
We won't be able to breathe.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.350
Scotty, Scotty,
you have to get this plane

02:31.352 --> 02:33.719
down to 8,000 feet
to equalize the pressure

02:33.721 --> 02:36.555
so Happy can open the hydraulics
hatch and fix the line!

02:36.557 --> 02:38.323
Science is already doing that
for us.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.825
Speed of the plane,
weight of the plane,

02:39.827 --> 02:41.927
and the plane's
g-force of 32.036,

02:41.929 --> 02:45.297
we'll reach 8,000 feet
in six minutes and 42 seconds,

02:45.299 --> 02:46.832
and then the ground
quickly thereafter.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.900
How quickly?

02:47.902 --> 02:50.202
Uh, 39.52 seconds.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.937
It's a shorter honeymoon
than I envisioned.

02:51.939 --> 02:55.207
Listen, if she can fix
the hydraulics,

02:55.209 --> 02:56.909
I'm gonna need
all the help I can

02:56.911 --> 02:58.477
to pull this from a free fall.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.878
I'll copilot!

03:01.215 --> 03:03.215
Ow, that actually hurt.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.184
Not like a crash will.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.419
Walt, hydraulics are under
your feet, so cut a rug.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.754
SCOTTY:
39,000 feet.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.722
31,000 to go.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.224
Everyone,
we're over the Pacific,

03:12.226 --> 03:13.892
so get your flotation devices
ready.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.195
Oh, God, I forgot
about the water.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.197
I am not a strong swimmer.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.665
30,000 feet!

03:19.667 --> 03:21.466
Mom, it's backwards.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.205
20,000 feet!

03:27.208 --> 03:28.707
No, this way.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.244
(plane creaking)

03:32.246 --> 03:34.446
Coming to 8,000 feet! You ready?

03:34.448 --> 03:35.480
Ready.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.850
8,000!

03:38.852 --> 03:40.852
Equalizing pressure. All right,

03:40.854 --> 03:42.354
get ready.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.489
(air blowing)

03:44.491 --> 03:47.259
You're good. Open up the hatch.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.228
There's a lot
of hydraulic fluid.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.996
(liquid dripping)

03:50.998 --> 03:52.397
Do you see the cut line?

03:52.399 --> 03:53.966
There's lots of lines,
give me a minute.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.767
We don't have a minute,
we have just over half a minute.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.302
Uh, I found the culprit--
shrapnel hit

03:57.304 --> 03:58.770
the hydraulic fluid reservoir.

03:58.772 --> 03:59.871
It's all drained out.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.006
You can fix it, right?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.941
Maybe. I did a fix like this

04:02.943 --> 04:04.009
when I was ice road trucking.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.677
You were what now?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.512
7,400 feet!

04:07.514 --> 04:08.947
Okay, we got to improvise
a reservoir.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.316
Any kind of fluid could be
enough to get us landed.

04:11.318 --> 04:14.319
Oh, oh, I packed a two-liter
bottle of Shazz Active

04:14.321 --> 04:15.687
to fight off
honeymoon hangovers.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.055
Here.

04:17.056 --> 04:18.422
Okay, Walt,
put a hole in the bottle cap.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.626
After I feed the tube
through the bottle cap,

04:20.628 --> 04:22.694
I'm gonna need something
to create a tight seal.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.297
Gum. I always fly with it
for Ralph's ear pressure.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.398
Ready?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.634
Everyone chew.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.304
Oh, what is this,
raspberry mint?

04:32.306 --> 04:34.806
Thanks for making
my last culinary experience

04:34.808 --> 04:35.974
a disappointing one.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.442
5,800 feet!

04:38.979 --> 04:40.612
HAPPY:
Okay, that's enough.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.514
Hand them over.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.549
Ugh, disgusting.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.454
Shazz, don't fail me now.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.557
Okay, we're done. Pull her up!

04:54.528 --> 04:56.028
(straining)

04:57.431 --> 04:59.665
(grunts)

04:59.667 --> 05:01.366
Hydraulics engaged, okay,

05:01.368 --> 05:02.601
we have control!

05:02.603 --> 05:04.036
We're not out of the woods yet.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.804
Yeah, but we are
out of the clouds.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.040
Everybody, get your vests on
and buckle in!

05:08.042 --> 05:10.309
There, to the right, an island.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.044
Good stretch of sandy beach.

05:12.046 --> 05:13.345
You think we can make it?

05:13.347 --> 05:15.314
Maybe if I dump fuel.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.349
The weight loss
will help us glide longer.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.051
Prevent a fiery crash
on impact? Do it.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.786
Okay.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.554
(mechanical whirring)

05:24.358 --> 05:26.358
Tricky turn on approach. Happy!

05:26.360 --> 05:28.026
Yeah, coming!

05:29.363 --> 05:31.930
How far's the island?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.099
3.4 miles and closing.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.801
How much fuel did we shed?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.069
13,000 pounds, give or take.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.470
Sly?

05:38.472 --> 05:40.105
We're gonna come up
a tenth of a mile short.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.441
Smack into the ocean
like hitting concrete.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.076
Not if we skip off it,
like a rock.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.645
HAPPY: The ocean absorbs
some collisional force,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.547
easing up our beach landing.
It's not crazy.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.581
It's not?

05:49.583 --> 05:50.682
Sly, run the numbers.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.050
Ralph, back him up.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.453
Barf bag.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.122
WALTER:
Going at 120 knots,

05:57.124 --> 05:59.858
factoring in the kinematic
viscosity of seawater

05:59.860 --> 06:02.527
and the diameter
of the plane's belly.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.098
RALPH AND SLY:
Nose up at 22 degrees.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.065
All right, roger that!

06:07.067 --> 06:09.401
I got her lined up on approach.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.837
You get back to the cabin.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.538
Like hell, I'm your copilot.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.408
The cockpit is the most
dangerous part of the plane.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.445
I'm the captain.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.082
It's not a request.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.151
(seat belt clicks)

06:32.059 --> 06:33.959
Ugh, our honeymoon sucks.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.127
Love you.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.396
I love you, too.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.398
Mom, I'm scared.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.566
It's gonna be okay.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.568
(panting)

06:43.570 --> 06:46.138
Okay, brace for impact in ten!

06:46.140 --> 06:48.106
Nine!

06:49.109 --> 06:50.709
Eight!

06:50.711 --> 06:52.411
I'm right here, sweetheart.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.079
Seven!

06:54.081 --> 06:56.615
Six!

06:56.617 --> 06:58.617
Five!

06:58.619 --> 07:01.453
Four!

07:01.455 --> 07:03.188
Three!

07:04.792 --> 07:07.192
Brace for impact!

07:31.652 --> 07:32.918
(grunts)

07:32.920 --> 07:34.486
Is everyone okay?

07:35.589 --> 07:37.522
(exhales)
We made it.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.990
(laughing):
I can't believe we all survived.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.259
Please remain in your seats

07:41.260 --> 07:43.527
until the captain turns off
the "crap your pants" sign.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.530
My life's still flashing
before my eyes.

07:45.532 --> 07:46.698
Is that why you look so bored?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.166
(moans)

07:48.168 --> 07:49.601
How long have we been out?

07:49.603 --> 07:52.070
Uh, must've been 20 minutes?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.473
Bravo on the landing, ace.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.841
Scotty?

07:59.913 --> 08:00.846
Door's jammed.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.248
You okay?

08:07.254 --> 08:10.021
(ocean waves rolling)

08:10.991 --> 08:13.592
Oh, my God.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.529
CABE: Cockpit got ripped
clean off in the crash.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.598
HAPPY:
Oh, there it is!

08:21.568 --> 08:24.202
(Walter exclaiming)

08:24.204 --> 08:26.271
SYLVESTER:
Scotty!

08:27.241 --> 08:28.240
(groaning)

08:28.242 --> 08:29.274
HAPPY:
Scotty?

08:31.812 --> 08:34.112
That was my seat.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.286
Hey. Did everybody make it?

08:41.288 --> 08:43.655
Yeah. Thanks to you.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.023
(chuckles)

08:45.025 --> 08:46.691
You know, teamwork, huh?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.727
Speaking of which,
my arm is stuck.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.595
Can you help me out?

08:50.597 --> 08:52.931
H-Hang, hang on, hang on.
Y-You can't move him.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.099
We need to get him out.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.734
I know, but he, he
needs a hospital.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.569
Hospital?
This island's deserted,

08:57.571 --> 08:59.304
we saw it from the plane,
there's nothing here.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.939
We don't even know
where "here" is.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.941
Um, Scotty, I'm sorry,

09:02.943 --> 09:04.743
can you just
give us one second?

09:04.745 --> 09:08.079
Uh, guys, sidebar.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.617
(groans)

09:13.287 --> 09:15.754
Guys, our fearless flyer
is in trouble.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.122
We are all in trouble.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.790
If rescuers
don't find us,

09:18.792 --> 09:19.958
we don't find
a fresh water source,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.793
we'll be dead in three days.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.296
I'm aware of that,
but Scotty is on a faster clock.

09:24.298 --> 09:26.932
He's talking, alert;
it doesn't seem that serious.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.266
No, that's a crush injury.
His arm

09:28.268 --> 09:30.068
and all surrounding muscles
have been pinned,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.137
and that results in a buildup
of deadly toxins--

09:32.139 --> 09:34.773
creatine kinase,
myoglobin, purines--

09:34.775 --> 09:35.974
so if we just free his arm,

09:35.975 --> 09:37.174
those toxins circulate
through his body,

09:37.177 --> 09:38.910
resulting in heart failure.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.644
Well, let's just leave him there
till we figure out what to do.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.047
No, no, that's not an option,
'cause soon enough,

09:42.049 --> 09:43.315
the toxins will seep
through the pinned veins

09:43.317 --> 09:44.983
and get to his heart anyway.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.650
Hold on. I've seen folks
pulled out of earthquake rubble

09:46.653 --> 09:48.687
after three days and they live.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.172
That's 'cause they're trapped
in an air pocket

09:50.173 --> 09:51.656
or under something heavy
that hasn't actually compressed

09:51.658 --> 09:52.958
their musculature.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.694
Scotty's forearm is
building up these toxins,

09:55.696 --> 09:56.962
and when the pressure
is big enough,

09:56.964 --> 09:58.129
molecular level diffusions

09:58.131 --> 09:59.598
will just push it
through the crush point.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.116
He will die.

10:01.117 --> 10:02.633
SYLVESTER: Then, what
are we supposed to do?

10:02.636 --> 10:03.935
It's not like we have access

10:03.937 --> 10:05.770
to a dialysis machine
on this island.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.275
Well, then-then we make one

10:10.277 --> 10:12.110
'cause if we don't,
he's dead in 60 minutes.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.179
♪ ♪

10:21.822 --> 10:24.089
This isn't<i> Gilligan's</i>
<i> Island.</i> We can't tae

10:24.090 --> 10:26.357
a couple of coconuts
and make a dialysis machine.
Who's Gilligan?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.159
TOBY: All right,
I'll figure something out.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.862
Guys, I need the needles
from the first aid kit,

10:30.864 --> 10:32.731
and we got to sterilize
them somehow

10:32.733 --> 10:33.865
so he doesn't get infected.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.234
Let's-let's not do
anything drastic, okay?

10:37.237 --> 10:38.970
Look, when an aircraft
goes missing,

10:38.972 --> 10:43.341
dozens of independent agencies
start a search.

10:43.343 --> 10:47.879
The EMP kept me from
signaling distress,

10:47.881 --> 10:49.347
but they know our course.

10:49.349 --> 10:54.052
L.A. to Tahiti is
a well-traversed route.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.255
Okay? So, let's,
let's just give it some time.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.658
If that time's longer
than an hour, you die.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.027
You guys aren't doctors,
you're-you're computer nerds.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.161
Actually, I am a doctor.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.063
A surgeon?
Of the mind.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.482
CABE:
He's a shrink,

11:07.483 --> 11:09.900
but these guys repaired my aorta
in the middle of the desert.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.903
These are the nerds
you can bet on.

11:11.905 --> 11:16.908
(scoffs) Okay, look, just do
whatever needs to be done,

11:16.910 --> 11:18.176
just be smart about it.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.779
Don't worry.
They're smart about everything.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.682
Uh, uh, I'm gonna start looking
through what survived the crash,

11:23.684 --> 11:25.817
see if I can make
a makeshift blood filter.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.452
Uh, one of you geniuses
come up with a plan

11:27.454 --> 11:28.753
to crack the
instrument panel open.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.455
I've been pondering
that for some time.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.023
The panel's compromised.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.758
Now, if we use brute force
to free Scotty,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.061
it could cause
further severe damage.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.363
So, we need to melt it and then
bend it off him like a hinge.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.466
To sterilize equipment and melt
the hinge, we'll need a fire.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.334
On it.
All right, I'll
go with the kid.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.704
Main thing I need for
the dialyzer is something

11:45.706 --> 11:47.706
that can process fluid
and do filtration.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.840
Oh, how about a coffee machine?

11:49.843 --> 11:50.742
Uh, that's my
wedding gift to you.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.776
It's in the plane storage.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.311
We didn't register for that.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.747
But the one
in the garage is subpar.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.749
You bought a gift
for the office?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.751
That's unbelievable, but sadly,
very believable.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.019
Coffee pot will do the trick.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.055
And I'm also gonna need
a semipermeable membrane

12:04.057 --> 12:06.224
to filter the toxins
out of the blood.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.094
I'm thinking maybe a tropical
version of vegetable parchment,

12:09.096 --> 12:12.097
like what they used in 19th
century dialysis experiments.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.766
Citrus has natural membranes
that could do the job.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.768
I'll go see if there's
any fruit on this island.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.070
You do realize that fruit is
somewhere in that scary jungle.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.472
What other choice do we have?

12:20.474 --> 12:22.073
Okay. I'll go with.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.942
Guys, now the EMP
fried our comm,

12:23.944 --> 12:25.477
so each group will
be on its own.

12:25.479 --> 12:27.512
Now, I will go with you, Paige.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.047
Uh, Toby, Happy, work
on the dialysis.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.665
Cabe and Ralph
should be back soon.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.282
Now, Scotty,
we're gonna pull this off.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.318
Just hold tight.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.820
I'm not going anywhere.

12:35.822 --> 12:38.123
TOBY:
Ticktock, people.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.892
Sly, I never thought I'd say
this, but slow down.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.827
You're-you're going too fast
into a dangerous area.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.330
Scotty doesn't have the luxury
of us being cautious.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.365
Besides, the odds of us
surviving on this island

12:47.367 --> 12:49.968
are so low,
what's the point of caution?

12:49.970 --> 12:53.438
Who is this guy
who looks like Sylvester?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.374
He's just having
a-a severe reaction

12:56.376 --> 13:00.445
to living through something that
has over a 99% fatality rate.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.415
He's probably already run
thousands of potential scenarios

13:04.417 --> 13:07.786
for getting off this island
and all of them have a chance

13:07.788 --> 13:10.855
of somewhere between
zero and nil.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.390
What about you?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.142
How are you holding up?

13:14.143 --> 13:15.893
I'm freaked out, but I decided
to stay positive.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.496
You know, me, too.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.097
Actually, after what happened
between us at the wedding,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.933
I am only feeling positive.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.535
(laughs) We will
get off this island

13:23.537 --> 13:25.436
because I have so
much to live for.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.472
That's very sweet.
I feel the same way.
Oh.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.177
A gift for...
(sniffs)

13:32.179 --> 13:33.278
...my new love.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.146
Oh. Nice.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.483
Yes. A-a flower
for my flower.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.186
Uh, okay. We should
stay focused

13:41.188 --> 13:42.987
on getting that
fruit Toby needs.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.323
Yeah, of course. I'm just
expressing how I feel.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.025
I feel nauseous.

13:47.027 --> 13:51.162
Oh, no. This is
gonna be a problem.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.001
Oh, boy.
Oh, no.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.469
Oh, look.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.272
Lime trees on the other side.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.473
This is too far to jump.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.976
Don't need to jump.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.261
Wait, Sly.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.545
Wait, are-are you
sure it's safe?

14:07.547 --> 14:08.613
Seems so.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.615
Oh, be careful.
What...

14:10.617 --> 14:12.951
Why? Odds are
we're all gonna die here.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.587
I'm playing with house money.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.856
I am worried something is
seriously wrong with him.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.624
Excellent maturation here.

14:19.626 --> 14:23.294
You know, if Toby were
here, he would say that

14:23.296 --> 14:26.364
Sly has spent his whole life
terrified of death.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.299
Now that he is facing
its imminent arrival,

14:28.301 --> 14:31.102
he has nothing left
to be scared of.

14:32.639 --> 14:36.107
You know, if we could find
some lemons on this island,

14:36.109 --> 14:38.042
we can mix them with
the leftover water bottles

14:38.044 --> 14:40.311
on the plane and
make a delicious...

14:42.249 --> 14:44.182
You guys need
to come over here now.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.351
Across a super high,
dangerous tree bridge?

14:46.353 --> 14:48.419
Trust me. It's worth it.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.927
Oh, boy.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.529
Thank goodness for the FAA
mandatory first aid kit.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.933
How come I'm not in more pain?

15:01.935 --> 15:03.635
It's 'cause your nerves
are compromised

15:03.637 --> 15:05.821
from the compression.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.006
Your brain has no idea
how much pain your body's in.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.607
HAPPY: Okay.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.442
Cabe and, uh, Ralph
are sterilizing

15:11.444 --> 15:12.610
the rest of the needles.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.679
Got the coffee maker,
cut the oxygen masks

15:14.681 --> 15:16.114
from over the seats.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.016
TOBY:
Great, hand me the tubing.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.353
Happy.

15:25.558 --> 15:29.193
If I had stayed in that seat...

15:29.195 --> 15:30.662
Scotty, I owe you my life.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.064
And I owe you my wife.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.266
That didn't sound right, did it?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.968
Just shut it
and get to work.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.603
This won't take
too long to build.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.672
Team Citrus
better be here soon.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.106
(groans)

15:43.076 --> 15:44.208
Took you long enough.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.077
WALTER:
That's a bunker.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.579
Nothing gets past a genius.

15:53.720 --> 15:58.222
This must be an old Japanese
World War II bunker.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.993
Oh, take a look at these maps.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.094
Ooh, this one
that's circled.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.329
You think that's
where we are?

16:04.331 --> 16:05.997
WALTER:
Well, that cove

16:05.999 --> 16:07.699
corresponds to where we landed.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.968
The shape isn't dissimilar
to what I was able to ascertain

16:09.970 --> 16:11.369
when we were crashing.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.204
If this is where we are,
then we are nowhere near

16:13.206 --> 16:14.739
where we thought
we were heading.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.542
We're 2,000 miles
southeast of Tahiti

16:17.544 --> 16:20.111
on an island in a giant swath
of the Pacific

16:20.113 --> 16:22.146
between New Zealand and Chile.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.115
The EMP blast on the plane
must've been preceded

16:24.117 --> 16:26.050
by an electromagnetic
field that wreaked havoc

16:26.052 --> 16:27.418
on the plane's instruments.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.387
It sent us off course
without the pilot even knowing.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.756
But rescue parties will still
be looking for us, right?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.658
WALTER: They'll be looking
for us, just not here.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.060
L.A. to Tahiti might be
a well-traversed route,

16:36.062 --> 16:37.996
but L.A. to uninhabited island,
not so much.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.198
I told you, the odds of
getting off this island

16:40.200 --> 16:42.567
are infinitesimal.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.636
I don't like fatalistic Sly.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.739
I like terrified-to-die Sly.

16:47.741 --> 16:50.141
That Sly's always looking
for solutions.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.213
Too late. I beat him to it.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.387
TOBY: You know,
this rubber bulb should let us

17:02.389 --> 17:06.057
manually create enough airflow
to get the dialyzer started.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.425
Taking engineering work
off my plate.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.593
Nice surprise. Thanks, Doc.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.495
My pleasure.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.264
Now, speaking of surprises,
um, ice road trucker?

17:13.266 --> 17:15.133
I mentioned it.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.603
No, no, I-I definitely would've
remembered the love of my life

17:18.605 --> 17:21.506
driving a multiton vehicle
over a frozen lake.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.475
Did you get the booze?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.443
Additive-free,
at least 80 proof?

17:25.445 --> 17:28.413
Grabbed it from
the plane's bar.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.416
Um, yeah, I-I-I don't know
if this will sterilize.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.450
This is in Portuguese.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.085
It's good. I read it.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.754
Before we met,
I designed automation

17:36.756 --> 17:38.523
for a Portuguese car plant.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.358
Wow.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.660
Learning more and more

17:42.662 --> 17:44.429
about my new bride,
aren't I?

17:44.431 --> 17:46.531
Guys! Got 'em!

17:46.533 --> 17:49.200
It's the waitress.
Looks like she's got fruit.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.069
TOBY:
Where are Sly and Walter?

17:51.071 --> 17:53.638
(water boiling)

17:53.640 --> 17:57.575
Not so fast around a fire.
You could get burned.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.177
The sooner we
sterilize the needles,

17:59.179 --> 18:00.745
sooner we save the pilot,
sooner we get home.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.713
Maybe you could move faster.

18:02.715 --> 18:08.152
Hey, now, it's okay
for you to be scared,

18:08.154 --> 18:12.590
but it is not okay for you to be
disrespectful to your elders.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.859
Now, that's not like you.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.562
Are you sure
everything's all right?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.597
(sighs)

18:19.599 --> 18:22.800
I'm scared Mom and Walter's new
relationship won't have a chance

18:22.802 --> 18:24.802
if we don't get back home
as soon as possible.

18:24.804 --> 18:28.639
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:28.641 --> 18:32.243
Come on. I saw how they held
hands as the plane went down

18:32.245 --> 18:35.480
and how Walter volunteered
to go with her into the jungle.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.281
Who needs help picking fruit?

18:37.283 --> 18:40.651
You consistently
impress me, kid.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.688
I've wanted Walter
to be my dad for years,

18:43.690 --> 18:45.323
and it's what I want for my mom,

18:45.325 --> 18:48.459
but this isn't a good
situation for a couple

18:48.461 --> 18:49.660
starting out.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.229
We need to get home.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.664
Radio?! We-we can get home.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.400
(sighs)
2,000 miles off course?

18:56.402 --> 18:58.402
You know,
I-I-I feel responsible.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.438
I-I-I didn't know
I was flying blind.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.640
It's not your fault the
instruments went wonky.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.876
Okay, Paige, Miss Portugal,
now, wash the lime membranes

19:04.878 --> 19:07.378
in this bottled water

19:07.380 --> 19:08.679
and then I will press them in
metal that sheared off the plane

19:08.681 --> 19:09.680
in the accident.

19:09.682 --> 19:10.882
Miss Portugal?

19:10.884 --> 19:12.483
Oh, you-- oh, yeah.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.585
Oh, you didn't know
Happy used to live there?

19:14.587 --> 19:16.587
Me neither.
There's actually so much

19:16.589 --> 19:17.722
that I don't know
about the woman

19:17.724 --> 19:19.690
I just agreed to
spend eternity with.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.626
One, I had a life
before I met you,

19:21.628 --> 19:22.727
and two,
I only learned the language

19:22.729 --> 19:24.295
so I could record my single.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.564
Record the what now?

19:26.566 --> 19:27.732
I said too much.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.201
No, you said way too little.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.335
(groans)

19:31.337 --> 19:33.504
Hey, oh, hey,
pal, you okay?

19:37.710 --> 19:40.578
Remember when you told me
my brain didn't know

19:40.580 --> 19:42.647
I was in so much pain?

19:42.649 --> 19:43.881
I think it figured it out.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.416
Well, you're just gonna
have to push through

19:45.418 --> 19:46.551
and we're gonna have
that dialysis machine

19:46.553 --> 19:48.586
ready to go soon, okay?

19:48.587 --> 19:50.620
We got clean needles,
sterilized tubing,

19:50.623 --> 19:52.890
organic filter...
in theory, this works.

19:52.892 --> 19:56.227
And in reality?

19:56.229 --> 19:58.663
In reality, there's
a very good chance

19:58.665 --> 20:00.665
you're going to be home
to see your baby be born.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.337
I didn't tell you
my wife was expecting.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.573
Well, you...

20:08.575 --> 20:10.575
you got nine perfectly
manicured fingernails,

20:10.577 --> 20:11.576
except for your left
thumb, which has

20:11.578 --> 20:12.577
been bitten to the quick,

20:12.579 --> 20:14.512
clearly from stress.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.315
And that photo on
your pilot's license,

20:17.317 --> 20:18.549
it's less than a year old--

20:18.551 --> 20:19.717
you look 20 pounds
lighter in it.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.320
I know men often
gain weight

20:22.322 --> 20:23.754
when their spouses
are pregnant.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.256
It's called the
Couvade effect.

20:25.258 --> 20:28.593
But mainly, you got
that, um, book

20:28.595 --> 20:31.295
in your pilot's
bag there.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.630
Ah, you saw that, huh?

20:32.632 --> 20:34.632
(Scotty sighs)

20:34.634 --> 20:39.604
You know, my wife is due
in three weeks.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.740
I don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.542
Scorpion doesn't fail.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.677
You will be
in that delivery room.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.914
Sly and Walter are working
on the rescue radio as we speak.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.849
This radio is never gonna work.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.551
What do you care?

20:53.553 --> 20:55.253
I thought you accepted
we're all gonna die.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.787
That was before
you found the radio.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.789
Our survival percentage
jumped a few points.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.691
I'm cautiously optimistic,

21:00.693 --> 21:03.027
but not if we can't get this
transistor box humming again.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.663
We can, we just need
a capacitor.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.798
Oh, great, I'll just run to
the store and grab you one.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.767
No need-- just pass me
one of those pieces

21:09.769 --> 21:11.769
of gum that Paige is
always sharing with you.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.604
(Sly sighs)
What's the problem?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.806
Well, we are on
a deserted island,

21:15.808 --> 21:18.643
and this is my last piece.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.749
Oh, that's truly awful.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.852
So I take this wire.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.854
I roll it in the wrapper,

21:29.856 --> 21:32.623
foil on the inside,
and instant capacitor.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.759
Actually,
it's incredible.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.827
All our brainpower
would be useless

21:36.829 --> 21:39.030
without Paige's humanity.

21:39.032 --> 21:42.667
If she wasn't thoughtful enough
to pack snacks for us,

21:42.669 --> 21:43.968
we would have no capacitor.

21:43.970 --> 21:47.505
In a way, she's smarter
than us all.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.706
What are you even
talking about?

21:48.708 --> 21:50.441
She's nowhere near
as smart as any of us.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.742
Agree to disagree.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.777
I disagree to agree.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.745
You've never
exercised your brain's

21:54.747 --> 21:56.647
emotional center before.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.482
The amygdala should be
the size of an almond.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.384
Yours is probably
the size of a pea.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.719
It has no idea how to handle

22:01.721 --> 22:02.953
being in love
for the first time,

22:02.955 --> 22:05.790
so you're acting like a putz.
A putz?

22:05.792 --> 22:08.826
Picking flowers,
saying how she's a genius.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.062
You really want Paige to enjoy

22:11.064 --> 22:12.330
the last three days
of your relationship

22:12.332 --> 22:13.597
before the Reaper comes?

22:13.599 --> 22:15.433
You should play it cool,
because all of this

22:15.435 --> 22:17.668
is... undignified.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.604
(man speaking Japanese on radio)
Oh. Oh, it's working.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.474
Well, the transmitter's shot,

22:23.476 --> 22:25.576
so we can't send a distress
signal, but we can listen.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.978
Didn't you learn Japanese when
you went undercover in prison?

22:30.550 --> 22:33.351
(man speaking Japanese
over radio)

22:33.353 --> 22:35.419
It's a cargo ship.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.722
Now, a Japanese vessel
is passing by

22:37.724 --> 22:39.123
two miles out in 17 minutes.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.726
Sly's monitoring
their radio chatter now.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.094
How long will it
be close to us?

22:43.096 --> 22:44.562
I did a rough nautical chart,

22:44.564 --> 22:46.797
based on the data
Sly could translate.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.466
We believe the ship will be
in our field of view

22:48.468 --> 22:49.500
for eight minutes.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.669
So we have to make
sure it sees us.

22:51.671 --> 22:52.903
'Cause if we don't,
it could be weeks

22:52.905 --> 22:54.438
until another ship comes by.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.773
Or months.
Or never.

23:01.447 --> 23:02.680
CABE: All right, so what
the hell do we do now?

23:02.682 --> 23:04.482
I checked the plane's
emergency compartment.

23:04.484 --> 23:07.585
The door got ripped off
during the crash,

23:07.587 --> 23:08.719
the flares are long gone.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.820
What if you fired
your gun in the air?

23:09.822 --> 23:10.821
Maybe someone on the
ship is deck side,

23:10.823 --> 23:12.740
and they hear us?

23:12.741 --> 23:14.658
My gun got ripped out
of the holster from the crash.

23:14.660 --> 23:15.893
I looked for it.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.661
Must have flown
into the water somewhere.

23:17.663 --> 23:19.864
Let's quintuple the size
of this fire.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.766
A boat could see it.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.000
TOBY:
That's a good idea.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.668
You, your mom, and Cabe

23:24.670 --> 23:26.404
handle that,
Happy and I will start

23:26.406 --> 23:27.471
cleaning out Scotty's blood.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.223
That filter should
be ready by now.

23:29.224 --> 23:30.974
He's got, like, 15 minutes left
if we don't hurry.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.643
Okay, and I'll heat
the control panel

23:32.645 --> 23:34.111
so we can set him free--
let's go.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.462
Got the fire.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.763
Okay, melt the panel.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.764
I'm gonna stick this guy
and start

23:53.766 --> 23:55.666
percolating some platelets.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.435
Now, Scotty,

23:57.437 --> 23:58.602
to insert the needles,

23:58.604 --> 24:00.471
I need to make an
arteriovenous graft.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.706
it's gonna sting a little.

24:02.708 --> 24:05.142
Okay, this will make it
sting less-- here, chew.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.744
What are they?
Kava root.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.045
A natural anesthetic.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.783
Thanks.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.453
I'm gonna turn away now.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.455
Kava root.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.456
A day of marriage, and you're
already thinking like a doctor.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.559
I drank Kava tea once
after spraining my ankle

24:21.561 --> 24:22.693
hiking in Morocco.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.795
Okay, you also lived in Morocco.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.597
No, I was visiting
my boyfriend, Jake.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.998
He was filming a movie.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.333
Hold the phone, w-wait.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.667
No, I remember,
you told me about Jake.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.537
You dated him, um,
eight years ago, right?

24:33.539 --> 24:35.539
Hey, you're about
to stick metal in my arm.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.041
Don't you want to keep
your eye on the ball?

24:37.043 --> 24:39.677
Eight years ago, the film
<i> Prince of Persia</i>

24:39.679 --> 24:41.879
was being shot in Morocco,
wasn't it?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.848
Don't follow the bread crumbs
on this one, Doc.

24:43.850 --> 24:47.651
And that was staring a, uh,
a certain Jake Gyllenhaal?

24:47.653 --> 24:50.554
Is that the, uh,
Jake that you dated?

24:50.556 --> 24:51.889
Who's Jake Gyllenhaal?

24:51.891 --> 24:54.024
Is he related to
that Gilligan fellow?

24:54.026 --> 24:56.126
I'm not saying
I didn't date him.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.862
Oh, wow.
You know what?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.730
I-I don't want to know
any more about you.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.532
I don't want to know
about long-haul trucking,

25:01.534 --> 25:03.334
I don't want to know
about celebrity dating.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.135
I certainly don't want
to know about this single

25:05.137 --> 25:07.037
that you recorded
in Portugal, okay?

25:07.039 --> 25:08.873
Less history, more mystery.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.908
Okay, we've got the
fire going strong.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.910
Cabe's keeping it smoky.
Ralph says it's 11 minutes

25:12.912 --> 25:14.778
till the ship sees us.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.680
WALTER:
Okay, the panel's weakened.

25:16.682 --> 25:17.915
How do you propose
we handle this?

25:17.917 --> 25:19.049
Very carefully.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.619
So, Walt will
lift the panel,

25:21.621 --> 25:24.755
Happy and I will carry
Scotty out of the plane,

25:24.757 --> 25:26.090
Paige will hold the tubing,

25:26.092 --> 25:27.791
and then I will start
pumping the blood

25:27.793 --> 25:28.859
through the filter.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.999
Okay, on three.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.868
One...
Wait, wait.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.104
Listen.

25:40.106 --> 25:43.007
If I don't walk
onto that boat with you guys...

25:45.545 --> 25:46.944
...please tell my wife
that I did

25:46.946 --> 25:48.846
everything I could
to stay alive.

25:48.848 --> 25:49.980
We'll tell her.

25:49.982 --> 25:53.183
Thanks.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.885
Okay, I'm ready.

25:54.887 --> 25:59.223
On three.
One, two,

25:59.225 --> 26:00.858
three!

26:00.860 --> 26:03.193
(metal creaking)

26:03.195 --> 26:06.163
(groaning)

26:08.167 --> 26:09.166
Okay, go, go, go.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.200
Go, go, go!

26:10.202 --> 26:12.336
Go, go, go!
(pained groans)

26:14.106 --> 26:16.907
Hang in there, chief,
you're halfway there.

26:19.612 --> 26:22.880
HAPPY: Get cracking.
We're losing him, Doc.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.848
All right, blood's filtering.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.685
Cleaning out the toxins.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.289
But... he isn't responsive.
Is he okay?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.758
Scotty.
Scotty!

26:34.760 --> 26:36.727
Scotty, can you hear me?

26:38.364 --> 26:39.363
Scotty.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.831
Scotty, come on!

26:41.801 --> 26:43.867
(gasps)

26:46.205 --> 26:48.973
You guys are gonna have to get

26:48.975 --> 26:51.175
a new coffee machine
for the office.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.877
Look, I'm not
gonna stop pumping

26:53.879 --> 26:56.046
till you've got three cycles of
your blood through the filter.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.915
You'll be good, just hang on
till the ship sees our smoke.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.984
Okay.

26:59.986 --> 27:03.187
Which they will,
thanks to the great fire

27:03.189 --> 27:04.788
that Paige helped build.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.857
You did a fantastic job.
Really superlative.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.960
Walt? It's fire.
Cavemen did it.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.395
Arsonists do it all the time.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.764
Don't be jealous
'cause me and my soul mate

27:13.766 --> 27:15.366
get along better than
you and your soul mate.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.234
What?
That's not true.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.068
Today it is.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.006
Walt, a moment?
Yeah.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.912
Okay, couldn't be happier
we said what we said

27:28.914 --> 27:30.314
to each other at Kovelsky's.
Me either,

27:30.316 --> 27:33.684
D.P.
"D.P."?

27:33.686 --> 27:36.220
Dedication Paige.
It's my nickname for you.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.655
You know, like in a book,

27:37.657 --> 27:40.057
except I'm dedicating
my love to you.

27:40.059 --> 27:43.894
Again, just like
the flower you gave me

27:43.896 --> 27:45.295
in the middle of a search
for something that

27:45.297 --> 27:48.832
could have saved a man's life,
it's really sweet,

27:48.834 --> 27:50.968
but maybe not the right time
for pet names.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.971
Oh. Okay.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.873
I'm sorry, it's just I'm...

27:55.875 --> 27:58.342
I'm... I'm full of these
feelings that I-I've never had.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.311
And you taught me to be
more EQ and to be frank.

28:01.313 --> 28:02.913
They're just kind of
coming out of my mouth.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.949
(chuckles) I think it's
because my amygdala is

28:05.951 --> 28:08.152
a pea instead of an almond.

28:08.154 --> 28:13.290
Yeah, maybe.
Anyway, here's the thing.

28:13.292 --> 28:17.428
You... suck at this.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.964
I'm not saying you will forever.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.934
I'm just saying
don't try so, so hard.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.836
I know how you feel,
you know how I feel.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.906
Let's just let it
progress naturally.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.774
Yeah, Sly gave me
similar advice.

28:30.776 --> 28:32.076
He said "be cool."

28:32.078 --> 28:33.043
He was right.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.478
And then he called me a putz.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.213
He could have said worse.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.415
CABE: Paige, Walter,
we got a big problem.

28:39.452 --> 28:41.018
WALTER:
What's going on?

28:41.020 --> 28:42.586
The wind picked up
and shifted.

28:42.587 --> 28:44.153
It's blowing the smoke
horizontal instead of vertical.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.090
If the ship's passing
in seven minutes,

28:46.092 --> 28:48.826
it'll never see the signal
if it doesn't get high enough.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.829
SYLVESTER:
Guys!

28:51.831 --> 28:54.098
What's wrong?

28:54.099 --> 28:56.366
On the radio, a weather front,
out in the Pacific...

28:56.368 --> 28:57.468
Oh, you think?

28:57.470 --> 28:59.803
We already know.
It's disrupted the fire.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.472
We don't think the boat
will be able to see it

29:01.474 --> 29:03.073
when it passes by
in a few minutes.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.274
We don't have a few minutes.

29:04.276 --> 29:07.444
I heard them reroute
the ship's course

29:07.446 --> 29:08.712
to avoid rough seas.

29:08.713 --> 29:09.979
I ran the numbers.
The ship will be

29:09.982 --> 29:11.982
passing the island
in 90 seconds,

29:11.984 --> 29:14.985
and it'll only be in view for
two minutes after that, tops.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.446
We're gonna need
a bigger signal.

29:25.447 --> 29:27.064
WALTER: No, not just
bigger, thicker.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.766
With bad weather
reducing visibility,

29:28.768 --> 29:30.801
we need smoke that will
absolutely be seen.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.436
Oh, wet burns denser smoke.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.305
Uh, driftwood, seaweed,
any wet vegetation.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.074
Perfect. Okay, Paige,
Cabe, the three of us

29:37.076 --> 29:38.242
will collect
the materials

29:38.244 --> 29:40.110
needed to
goose the fire.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.411
Sly, there is no
way you would go

29:41.413 --> 29:43.447
to the South Pacific
without packing binoculars

29:43.449 --> 29:45.249
for bird watching.
They're on the plane.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.050
Okay, perfect. Go grab them
so we can look for the boat.

29:47.052 --> 29:48.285
Toby, Happy,
stay with Scotty.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.820
Let's go, everyone, now.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.825
Ah!

29:57.530 --> 29:58.529
Oh.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.164
(laughing):
Oh!

30:00.166 --> 30:01.565
There you are.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.833
Okay.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.003
Holy sherbet.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.973
Guys!

30:09.975 --> 30:11.508
I found a flare gun!
We don't need to worry

30:11.510 --> 30:12.476
about fire or wind

30:12.478 --> 30:13.443
or anything.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.312
Give me that.
Give me that.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.281
Okay.

30:17.282 --> 30:19.249
Let's hope this thing didn't
get damaged in the crash.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.318
Ship's in sight.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.586
Start the clock.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.154
WALTER:
Okay, our two-minute window

30:24.156 --> 30:25.589
starts now. Fire.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.558
(flare gun clicks)

30:27.560 --> 30:29.393
Firing pin is busted
on this thing.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.828
What, it's useless?

30:30.830 --> 30:32.697
CABE:
No.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.565
The flare's intact; we're gonna
have to crack the capsule open,

30:34.567 --> 30:35.850
light it up.

30:35.851 --> 30:37.134
There's no way
they see it on the beach.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.302
This needs to get airborne.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.837
Then we launch it.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.538
There's a rectangular-shaped
gift box with resistance

30:41.540 --> 30:43.240
training bands in them
from a home workout kit.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.909
I can create a slingshot
and launch the sucker.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.512
All right, I'll go find them.
Sly, you come with me, come on.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.880
How do you know
what people got us?

30:49.882 --> 30:50.981
It was my gift to you.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.316
Oh, oh, oh,

30:52.318 --> 30:54.184
so my physique needs
some fine-tuning now?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.220
It's not Gyllenhaal
enough for you?
(groaning)

30:56.222 --> 30:57.421
Doc?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.093
Pulse is weak,
unsteady.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.394
What happened? I thought
your machine worked.

31:04.396 --> 31:05.896
You mean the one we made
out of fruit skins

31:05.898 --> 31:06.897
and a coffee pot?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.565
100 seconds!

31:08.567 --> 31:10.567
TOBY:
What is this?

31:10.569 --> 31:12.202
Oh, this is a
Grey Turner's sign.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.537
This is a classic indicator

31:13.539 --> 31:14.872
of internal bleeding.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.573
He is not dying from
crush injury toxins,

31:16.575 --> 31:18.609
he is bleeding from the abdomen.

31:18.611 --> 31:20.444
This is likely a vital organ.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.079
Do something.
Well, how do you expect me

31:22.081 --> 31:23.213
to cauterize
an internal wound

31:23.215 --> 31:24.615
that I can't
spot or I.D.?

31:24.617 --> 31:25.916
SYLVESTER:
Guys...

31:25.918 --> 31:27.651
we found the resistance band.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.453
Now, give me that flare
so we can get it skyward.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.055
WALTER:
That's it.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.656
We can use the flare
to save Scotty.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.092
Toby, we can use the strontium
nitrate from the cartridge

31:35.094 --> 31:36.460
to cauterize the wound.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.028
You're gonna light
a flare in him?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.263
He's not a jack-o'-lantern.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.430
No, no, no,
W-Walt's right.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.015
The caustic nature
of the chemical

31:42.016 --> 31:43.599
can cauterize because
it denatures proteins.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.035
As soon as it
comes in touch

31:45.037 --> 31:46.637
with-with the bleeding
organic material,

31:46.639 --> 31:49.039
it'll act as a kind of, like,
instant internal spackle,

31:49.041 --> 31:50.274
and it'll close off
the wound.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.942
85 seconds!

31:51.944 --> 31:53.377
If we do that,
the flare's kaput,

31:53.379 --> 31:55.012
and we are never
leaving this island.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.647
Logically,
we're saving Scotty now

31:56.649 --> 31:58.916
so he can likely die
in a few days of dehydration.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.584
Now, my brain says
launch the flare,

32:00.586 --> 32:02.286
but another part of me
says save Scotty.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.087
That'd be your heart, son.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.156
But I think that
there's a way to save Scotty

32:06.158 --> 32:07.524
and all of us as well.
Uh, Toby,

32:07.526 --> 32:08.659
how much powder
do we need for the wound?

32:08.661 --> 32:10.560
A few tablespoons.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.929
Okay, Paige,
cup your hands.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.465
Yeah.
(grunts)

32:15.467 --> 32:17.234
Now, that should
be more than enough

32:17.236 --> 32:18.969
to save Scotty.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.703
We'll err on the side
of saving his life.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.556
Cabe?

32:22.557 --> 32:24.407
Let's wrap that band around the
bent metal of the wings.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.575
70 seconds!

32:25.577 --> 32:28.378
TOBY: Okay, I'm gonna need
something cylindrical

32:28.380 --> 32:30.948
to act as a shunt to deliver
the strontium nitrate,

32:30.950 --> 32:33.451
something we can
sterilize.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.953
How about a metal straw
from a vintage milkshake kit?

32:35.955 --> 32:37.304
Surprise.

32:37.305 --> 32:38.654
We never registered
for that, either.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.424
That's perfect,
get the straw.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.626
Darling bride, can you
please be my prep nurse

32:42.628 --> 32:44.328
or is that the one job
you've never had?

32:45.664 --> 32:47.064
Okay, s-save enough

32:47.065 --> 32:48.465
to sterilize the straw
and your pocket knife.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.401
Hey. thank you for saving
the guy who saved me.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.670
Of course.
Pour some on his bruise.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.405
I know you've been
a little bit anxious today,

32:55.407 --> 32:56.740
learning all that stuff
about me.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.008
Truth is,
I've bounced around

32:58.010 --> 32:59.009
a lot in my life--

32:59.011 --> 33:00.677
always kind of unsettled,

33:00.679 --> 33:01.712
trying things that came my way,

33:01.714 --> 33:03.080
looking for a home.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.414
Point is, you're
gonna find out

33:04.416 --> 33:06.249
a lot of weird stuff about me.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.118
Like your Southern European
singing career?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.720
You're never gonna get
the details on that.

33:09.722 --> 33:12.589
Bottom line, I would not
change anything in my past

33:12.591 --> 33:14.324
because it's led me
to where I am today.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.626
Abandoned on an island
with little chance of survival?

33:16.628 --> 33:19.096
It led me to be your wife,
jackass.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.731
And of all the things

33:20.733 --> 33:25.202
I've ever been or will ever be,
that one is my favorite.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.336
SYLVESTER:
Straw!

33:26.338 --> 33:27.537
Ah.
Okay.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.705
40 seconds!

33:28.707 --> 33:29.773
TOBY:
Knife?

33:33.112 --> 33:34.111
Oh, I'm looking away.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.178
Oh, me too.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.015
28 seconds!

33:38.017 --> 33:39.449
(band stretching)
Are you ready?

33:39.451 --> 33:42.352
Just finishing
up the slingshot.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.787
Well, since we don't know
where the bleed is,

33:43.789 --> 33:45.522
I'm making the incision
at the point

33:45.524 --> 33:47.157
with the greatest proximity
to the highest number

33:47.159 --> 33:48.258
of vital organs.

33:49.628 --> 33:52.462
Okay, incision made. Straw?

33:56.301 --> 33:57.768
Okay, Paige, pour it in.

33:57.770 --> 33:59.219
But I never sterilized.

33:59.220 --> 34:00.669
Well, when the chemical
hits the wound,

34:00.672 --> 34:02.606
the pH of the reaction
should kill off any bacteria.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.775
(power pouring)

34:04.777 --> 34:06.743
Seven seconds!

34:09.081 --> 34:10.313
How do we know it's working?

34:10.315 --> 34:12.716
The bleeding stops,
the bruise disappears.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.051
Four seconds!

34:21.794 --> 34:23.460
One second!

34:28.267 --> 34:30.634
CABE: Time's up.
Let her rip, son.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.242
Would you look at that.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.411
Would you look at that!

34:41.413 --> 34:42.746
Bruise is receding.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.083
And the pulse is back!

34:46.085 --> 34:47.651
HAPPY:
There he is.

34:47.653 --> 34:50.420
We got to stop
meeting like this.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.724
Ship's in my sights.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.394
It's got to turn
around soon.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.361
Any minute now.

34:58.363 --> 34:59.763
Scotty's alert
and stable.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.264
Good job with him.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.399
Good job with the flare.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.201
The flare got up pretty high.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.769
Walt got it up there, all right.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.774
And while we wait to, uh,
go back to civilization,

35:10.776 --> 35:12.409
can I steal you
for a minute?

35:12.411 --> 35:13.276
Sure.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.479
Um... okay.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.584
So, um, about our
conversation earlier

35:20.586 --> 35:23.353
about how you've been
acting, uh, since we...

35:23.355 --> 35:24.788
expressed our feelings
for each other.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.324
Yes. You were totally right.

35:27.326 --> 35:30.360
I, um, was over-eager.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.195
And I'm not fully
sure how to approach

35:32.197 --> 35:33.864
our current
relationship situation,

35:33.866 --> 35:37.300
but I have taken what you said
to me into consideration

35:37.302 --> 35:39.136
and I promise, going forward,

35:39.138 --> 35:41.571
to, uh, fight
any instinct that I have.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.341
No. You-you did nothing wrong.

35:44.343 --> 35:47.644
If anyone was a putz, it was me,
for-for saying what I said.

35:47.646 --> 35:51.248
Uh... I'm incredibly confused.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.582
Listen,
I learned something

35:52.584 --> 35:55.519
from Toby and Happy today.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.187
We're gonna learn
a lot about each other

35:57.189 --> 35:58.421
as we go on this journey.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.357
Things, things we didn't
know, things that...

36:00.359 --> 36:01.892
may be uncomfortable.

36:01.894 --> 36:05.795
Like-like, I learned that
you can be... super geeky

36:05.797 --> 36:07.330
when trying to do
romantic boyfriend stuff.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.765
That's 'cause you've
never done it before.

36:08.767 --> 36:09.699
(chuckles)
And-and the truth is,

36:09.701 --> 36:11.801
it's... sweet.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.771
So, however you want
to express yourself,

36:14.773 --> 36:16.406
it's okay by me.

36:19.778 --> 36:22.746
Well, that is
wonderful to hear...

36:22.748 --> 36:23.947
my little arrhythmia.

36:25.217 --> 36:28.552
B-Because I make your heart
skip a beat?

36:28.554 --> 36:30.487
Exactly.
(chuckles)

36:31.890 --> 36:33.223
(chuckles nervously)

36:34.893 --> 36:37.961
(sighs) Oh, this is gonna be
harder than I thought.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.804
What are you more nervous about?

36:47.806 --> 36:50.540
The boat turning around
or those two guys?

36:51.510 --> 36:52.776
(sighs)
I hope he doesn't blow it

36:52.778 --> 36:54.844
'cause I haven't had a dad
in a long time

36:54.846 --> 36:56.980
and I know
he'd be perfect.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.416
For me and my mom.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.817
All right, wrap it up,
here they come.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.319
PAIGE:
Hey.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.486
The boat turn
around yet?

37:03.488 --> 37:04.554
Any minute now.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.889
That flare got up pretty high.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.324
Walt got it up
there, all right.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.525
How's it looking?

37:08.527 --> 37:10.393
Don't think the boat's
gotten any closer.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.696
Well, it's a big vessel.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.931
Takes a-a while
to change course.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.367
Boat on its way?

37:17.369 --> 37:20.704
Any minute now.
The flare got up pretty high.

37:23.709 --> 37:24.908
Hey, did the flare...

37:24.910 --> 37:26.343
Walt got it up there,
all right?!

37:26.345 --> 37:28.445
Okay. Sheesh.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.614
Scotty's resting.
He's doing great.

37:30.616 --> 37:31.915
How long till
the boat's here?

37:44.463 --> 37:46.930
The Water Channel.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.901
HB... Ocean.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.874
Sea... BS.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.910
Get it? Sea-BS?

38:00.912 --> 38:03.480
Stopped being funny
15 days ago.

38:04.950 --> 38:05.949
Sea-W?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.684
Huh?

38:16.995 --> 38:18.928
This is the good stuff
right here.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.267
Coconut?

38:24.268 --> 38:25.534
Any more hooch on the plane?

38:25.537 --> 38:26.836
Just the Portuguese stuff.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.038
That'll work.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.410
Really getting
the hang of fishing.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.312
Hey, uh, perhaps after dinner,

38:35.314 --> 38:37.580
you, me and Ralph
can take a walk by the cove?

38:37.582 --> 38:38.982
Yeah, fantastic.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.418
18th straight day
on a cove walk?

38:41.420 --> 38:43.453
Can never get enough
sand and shells.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.322
That is the sense of humor
that is making

38:45.324 --> 38:47.557
this whole ordeal bearable,
(chuckles)

38:47.559 --> 38:49.626
my little... asthma.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.996
'Cause she takes
your breath away?
(snaps fingers)

38:52.998 --> 38:54.964
I'm gonna go brine this fish.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.969
Afternoon, Cabe.
Fish for dinner tonight?

38:59.971 --> 39:02.872
You really got it up there.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.042
Hey, Walt, have
you seen Sly?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.913
He's still in the bunker.

39:09.915 --> 39:13.116
And I think he's
kind of losing his mind.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.051
SYLVESTER: Three and a half days
until we're out of coconuts.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.587
Fish migration patterns have
changed with colder weather.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.923
Got to keep Ralph alive
so he can tell our story,

39:19.925 --> 39:21.925
but how with no food?

39:21.927 --> 39:24.027
What's that, Mitchell?

39:24.029 --> 39:26.062
We can't eat Cabe.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.964
That'd be crazy.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.033
Now, let's get back
to rehearsing.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.902
I'll take the first verse
this time.

39:32.904 --> 39:38.074
♪ Daisy, Daisy,
give me your answer, do. ♪
