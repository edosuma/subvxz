00:06.966 --> 00:09.298
(theme music playing )

00:17.727 --> 00:20.639
( crowd chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

00:27.236 --> 00:29.522
( crowd continues chanting )

00:34.994 --> 00:36.985
They roar your name.

00:38.748 --> 00:41.706
Soon they shall roar
yours as well

00:41.876 --> 00:45.289
or mourn it,
if your mind is absent the task.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.628
l'm yet to have word
on my wife and son.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.506
I will not fight alongside a man
who is not clear to his purpose.

00:53.137 --> 00:55.503
I am clear.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.718
My purpose is blood.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.544
Shield.

01:35.137 --> 01:38.220
(yelling)

01:51.487 --> 01:52.693
Oh yes!

01:52.863 --> 01:55.479
Even chained to an inferior gladiator,
Spartacus prevails.

01:55.658 --> 01:58.525
One would expect no less
from the champion of Capua.

01:58.703 --> 02:01.319
See how he ignites
the crowd.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.328
His presence
at your son's birthday

02:03.499 --> 02:05.285
will be the talk
of the republic.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.871
A far cry
from my own 15th year.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.422
When I put on the toga virilis
and passed into manhood,

02:10.589 --> 02:13.922
it was a stuffy, formal ceremony
ridden with corpses and hags.

02:14.093 --> 02:17.460
Batiatus: My father
deemed himself an orator,

02:17.638 --> 02:20.926
lulled our guests to slumber,
some never to reawaken.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.761
We would not have it so
for Numerius.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.176
Calavius: He's been clamoring
for a pair of your finest

02:25.354 --> 02:27.936
to battle in exhibition
at his celebration.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.813
Well, we would see him
well satisfied.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.849
And by extension,
his noble father.

02:32.028 --> 02:34.485
Though a thought strikes--
if you hold the celebration

02:34.655 --> 02:36.191
beneath my humble roof,

02:36.365 --> 02:38.947
then your boy can bear close witness
to all my gladiators.

02:39.118 --> 02:42.485
Could we, Father? Please?

02:42.663 --> 02:46.121
And the extra cost
for such generosity?

02:46.292 --> 02:48.328
A favor between friends.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.289
Received with much gratitude.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.466
You're next, Spartacus.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.712
Come here.

03:13.152 --> 03:15.484
Are you certain
it won't cause imposition?

03:15.654 --> 03:17.815
Place it
from your thoughts.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.276
A boy becomes a man
but once in his life.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.658
He should be richly indulged
in his interests.

03:22.828 --> 03:26.491
He never ceases
to tire of the games.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.826
He's of the same obsessive ilk
as llithyia

03:29.001 --> 03:30.912
regarding blood and sport.

03:31.087 --> 03:33.749
Herabsence
comes as a surprise.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.879
Has she returned to Rome,

03:36.050 --> 03:37.881
absent farewells?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.258
No.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.339
She has been feeling unwell.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.971
Nothing serious, I hope?

03:44.141 --> 03:47.008
It will pass, as all things
born of a weak stomach.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.499
His armor gives pause.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.706
Then we shall aim higher.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.383
Pull!

04:48.247 --> 04:49.612
Oh.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.576
Oh yeah!

05:12.146 --> 05:13.761
I've never seen
anything like it.

05:25.784 --> 05:29.993
( crowd chanting )

05:30.164 --> 05:31.654
Yeah!

05:36.295 --> 05:39.253
Man: Open the gates!
Open the gates!

05:39.423 --> 05:41.129
Get up.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.712
( men cheering )

05:43.886 --> 05:45.877
Man: Spartacus.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.714
Man: Live to fight
another day.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.975
lt pains me to watch others
claim your laurels.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.983
Your pain will increase
if you continue to stand beside me.

06:03.656 --> 06:06.523
Man: Well done, brother.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.486
Well done.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.996
- You fought well today.
- The gods favored me

06:14.166 --> 06:15.542
to count you as ally.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.961
Their favor extends
beyond the arena.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.375
Aurelia.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.353
lfeared lwould never
hold you again.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.765
Ashur said he found only blood
when I sent him to you with message.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.355
- Titus had returned.
- Did he hurt you?

06:43.529 --> 06:45.645
I will see his heart
from his fucking chest.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.109
The blood was not mine.

06:48.284 --> 06:51.822
I cut him, deep and low.

06:51.996 --> 06:56.740
He will never force himself
on a woman again.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.875
Afterwards I sought refuge
with my brother's family in the hills.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.331
The slave girl found me there,

07:02.506 --> 07:04.497
by Spartacus's direction.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.666
Thank the gods you're safe.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.349
Where were they when Titus
first laid hands on me?

07:15.519 --> 07:18.056
I still carry his child.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.355
Nothing's changed, Varro.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.646
The entire world has changed,

07:28.824 --> 07:31.736
and I along with it.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.946
The child--

07:34.121 --> 07:36.032
it springs from your belly,

07:36.206 --> 07:37.742
a part of you.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.248
And I would love it as such

07:40.419 --> 07:42.410
if you would have it so.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.801
(Licinia laughing)

08:08.947 --> 08:11.324
Your absence was noticed.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.778
Absence?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.488
The games.

08:15.663 --> 08:18.075
You were supposed to join us.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.955
I could not face prying eyes.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.539
One look into mine and they
would have full knowledge--

08:24.713 --> 08:27.125
Licinia's blood,

08:27.299 --> 08:30.336
her skull steeped
between my fingers.

08:30.511 --> 08:34.971
Jupiter's cock,
would you come to grips?

08:35.140 --> 08:37.552
Licinia's murder
and your part in it

08:37.726 --> 08:39.262
have been concealed.

08:39.436 --> 08:43.020
The truth will only unfold

08:43.190 --> 08:45.932
if yourjaw splits
and your tongue unfurls in song.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.441
What would you
have me do?

08:47.611 --> 08:49.977
Appear yourself,

08:50.155 --> 08:54.319
absent conscience
of deeds unknown.

08:54.493 --> 08:57.326
The magistrate's celebration
provides a perfect opportunity.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.657
The venue turns
to my husband as host.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.788
You won't even have to
move from under this roof,

09:01.959 --> 09:04.666
my hand ever present
to steady your resolve.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.162
You will guide me
through this?

09:09.842 --> 09:12.504
As trusted friend.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.294
And as such,
I require a favor.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.805
We would swell
the ranks of celebration

09:18.976 --> 09:21.843
with these noble citizens,

09:22.020 --> 09:24.602
ones I'm certain
would accept the invite

09:24.773 --> 09:27.856
from the daughter
of Senator Albinius.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.316
Gather yourself.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.733
See it done.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.801
( groans )

10:04.980 --> 10:08.313
I owe you more
than I can ever repay.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.816
If you had not sent Mira
to find my wife...

10:10.986 --> 10:12.772
She has taken you
backthen?

10:12.946 --> 10:15.323
And lwill yet be
the man she deserves.

10:15.491 --> 10:18.107
If not, I shall remind you
of your shortcomings.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.277
Oh, it lifts the heart

10:21.455 --> 10:24.697
to see a man reunited
with his woman.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.288
Now you'll have someone
to weep for you when you die.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.748
If I fall,
it will be in the arena,

10:30.923 --> 10:33.084
as a gladiator.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.670
You remember what that is like,
do you not?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.719
Spartacus, Crixus,

10:39.890 --> 10:41.755
you are summoned.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.009
We are to fight each other?

10:45.187 --> 10:46.893
Numerius has chosen.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.929
He insisted on drinking in
the spectacle

10:49.107 --> 10:51.769
of present glories
pitted against the past.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.560
And his thirst shall be
satisfied, Dominus.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.239
Keep in mind
this is an exhibition.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.738
Blood may be spilled,
but only for show.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.742
Serious punishment will be meted out
to the man who caused them.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.028
We shall serve you
with honor, Dominus.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.992
I expect no less.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.702
Return to quarters.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.832
Spartacus, remain.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.962
What make you of Crixus?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.340
Numerius insisted upon him,
yet with his wounds barely sealed...

11:17.511 --> 11:19.126
He believes himself ready.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.840
To a fault.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.266
The ego bruises deeper
than the flesh.

11:25.477 --> 11:28.469
He brought this house
great honor not long ago.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.638
Do not overly embarrass
the man.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.567
I will give Numerius a show,
nothing more.

11:36.655 --> 11:40.193
When I put on the toga virilis,
it was in this very room,

11:40.367 --> 11:43.279
surrounded by my father's
champions.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.695
Even then I knew
that one day

11:46.874 --> 11:49.661
my own titans
would eclipse them all,

11:49.835 --> 11:52.451
none more so
than Spartacus,

11:52.629 --> 11:55.166
the bringer of rain.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.629
Eh? Ha ha!

12:00.679 --> 12:02.340
You honor me.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.222
You stand above all others.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.849
Continue on this path,

12:08.020 --> 12:10.181
and we will have the world!

12:10.355 --> 12:12.220
( roars )

12:30.042 --> 12:31.873
You have been avoiding me.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.786
l have been tending
my duties.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.249
Your manner hardens.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.881
I prefer it soft, as the moment
we shared not so long ago.

12:40.052 --> 12:44.421
You mistake smile and friendly touch
beyond intent.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.964
And the key that went missing
from my clasp

12:47.142 --> 12:49.884
after your friendly touch?

12:50.062 --> 12:55.182
It did not by mistake
draw into your palm, did it?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.392
It did not.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.812
And yet you tense
from question.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.073
Such reaction warrants
fair search.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.029
My hands service
Domina alone.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.865
She would not be pleased
to have yours

13:09.039 --> 13:12.372
laid upon me
without her consent,

13:12.542 --> 13:17.036
or to learn a guard
has misplaced his key.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.544
I would not have it so.

13:23.762 --> 13:27.846
You have a reputation
for your handling of women.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.473
Seek your loss
among them

13:30.644 --> 13:33.386
and do not press me again
with accusation.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.195
You trust llithyia
not to come unhinged

13:47.369 --> 13:48.779
in front of the magistrate?

13:48.954 --> 13:50.660
I shall keep
watchful eyes upon her.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.412
More watchful than the last,
I pray.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.619
Everything worked
to our advantage.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.955
llithyia's in our debt,
and through collection

13:58.130 --> 14:00.462
we gained access
to the most noble of families.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.543
She attends to the list?

14:02.718 --> 14:05.630
She will draw all
to the magistrate's celebration,

14:05.804 --> 14:08.796
so artfully placed
within our walls.

14:08.974 --> 14:12.762
There must be no cause
for disappointment.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.804
After the exhibition
between Spartacus and Crixus

14:16.982 --> 14:19.519
has ignited his son,

14:19.693 --> 14:21.900
I will broach the magistrate
on the subject of political office.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.026
And be well received.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.153
( guffaws )

14:26.324 --> 14:28.986
To behold Solonius's face
when he sees me

14:29.161 --> 14:32.528
consort with the highest
echelon of Capua...

14:32.706 --> 14:35.448
Solonius? And how should he
witness such a thing?

14:35.625 --> 14:38.833
By invitation.
I desire his eyes upon me

14:39.004 --> 14:41.791
when I am anointed
by the magistrate.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.001
I want him to see
that as my fortunes rise,

14:44.176 --> 14:46.667
his plummet.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.928
You taunt an injured snake,

14:50.098 --> 14:52.009
one that may yet turn
and strike.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.049
Ease your mind.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.811
The serpent's head will be struck
from its body in due course.

14:57.981 --> 15:02.315
And Solonius will never
see it coming.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.134
So you and Crixus battling
as entertainment, eh?

15:34.309 --> 15:37.221
- Something the boy will never forget.
- It is only exhibition.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.306
Dominus gave
strict instructions

15:39.481 --> 15:41.563
to avoid grievous injury.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.585
I do not believe
he was listening.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.726
Your Gaul is restored.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.888
Lucretia: He is not alone.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.557
The sun has revived
what the night had withered.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.067
Due to kindness
of a dear friend.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.650
And is that kindness
returned?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.689
The magistrate's celebration

16:32.868 --> 16:36.577
will swell
with all names provided.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.158
Gratitude.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.870
Would that I had words
to multiply it in response.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.829
Aw fuck.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.998
My finger.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.750
(laughing)

16:51.928 --> 16:54.590
Yet the value of a friend
cannot be expressed

16:54.764 --> 16:57.927
by the clever grouping
of letters.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.639
It is blood and flesh,

17:01.813 --> 17:04.520
granting life to the world.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.033
You submit like a fucking girl
begging for a cock to split her open.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.865
l was bested.
What would you have me do?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.825
Rise and fight
till your final breath

17:20.999 --> 17:22.990
or prove the name
brother false.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.995
Heard of opportunities
in Sicilia.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.506
Had I been wise, we would have
moved there to escape my debts.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.088
Yet the advice of my wife
fell short of its mark.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.218
It is a distance to travel--

17:36.389 --> 17:38.675
from a woman's mouth
to a man's ears.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.717
I shall close the gap

17:42.896 --> 17:45.262
from this point forward.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.399
Aurelia tells me Sicilia is an island
blessed by the gods.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.276
You must visit us there
when you gain freedom.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.985
| no longer concern myself
with thoughts beyond these walls.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.899
And nor should you.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.195
A true champion
dreams only of the arena.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.867
And what does one dream of
when he's no longer a champion?

18:11.675 --> 18:15.839
Regaining the title from the thief
who stole it from me.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.218
He stole nothing.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.175
If I am a thief,

18:19.349 --> 18:21.510
the crime was witnessed
by all of Capua

18:21.685 --> 18:24.722
and is still celebrated
to this day.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.807
Guard: Spartacus!

18:28.149 --> 18:30.401
You are summoned.

18:42.914 --> 18:46.031
The magistrate will arrive tomorrow,
well in advance of his guests,

18:46.209 --> 18:48.700
to ensure that preparations
are to his standards.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.254
While I reassure him,

18:50.422 --> 18:52.458
I would have you
tend the boy.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.294
lt's imperative
that he is well satisfied,

18:55.468 --> 18:58.756
and by proximity
his noble father.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.966
The name Batiatus
will be honored.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.132
And envied
throughout the republic.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.734
Spartacus:
You move unwisely.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.355
You play?

19:14.529 --> 19:16.110
I've had occasion,

19:16.281 --> 19:18.021
during my time
with the auxiliary.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.939
By all means,

19:20.118 --> 19:21.858
grace us
with your knowledge.

19:33.631 --> 19:37.715
It appears our champion
has no head for games of strategy.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.800
( chuckles )

19:42.974 --> 19:44.885
Battles may be lost,

19:45.060 --> 19:48.552
and yet the war
concludes in victory.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.353
Ah, treacherous fuck.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.858
( laughs)

19:56.029 --> 19:58.315
Played like a true Roman.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.572
Fall from your chair
and bring us some wine.

20:11.503 --> 20:14.119
The Syrian could swindle
the scales from a snake,

20:14.297 --> 20:15.707
but never command
a charge.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.965
Come, let us have
a contest between men.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.855
Oh, your touch
has been missed.

20:35.026 --> 20:39.144
And thoughts of yours
consume me.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.109
Soon you will feel
the hands of a champion

20:42.283 --> 20:44.365
once again upon you.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.027
The match with Spartacus
is but exhibition.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.413
I know the crowd as my heart.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.165
They will yearn for blood,

20:53.336 --> 20:56.248
and I shall give it to them.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.379
Dominus forbids injury.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.792
To make attempt
on Spartacus's life is to--

21:01.970 --> 21:03.301
is to risk your own.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.087
This is my life.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.598
If not champion,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.429
lam nothing.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.013
Then I must be
without my mind

21:15.191 --> 21:17.682
to love only the man.

21:17.861 --> 21:20.398
Yes.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.904
And | relish your madness.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.442
Oh, fuck the heavens.

22:09.621 --> 22:13.113
How can you keep besting a man
so far above your station?

22:14.876 --> 22:17.868
l sprung from my mother
with sword in hand.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.458
The ways of battle
are second nature,

22:20.632 --> 22:23.123
passed down
from father to son.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.297
I regret my own father
never saw

22:27.472 --> 22:30.009
the advantage
of military glory,

22:30.183 --> 22:32.799
never saw the spoils
that could be won,

22:32.977 --> 22:36.094
the patronage, the alliances forged
had he taken up arms.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.934
He aspired to be no further
than what he was--

22:42.111 --> 22:44.523
a simple lanista,

22:44.697 --> 22:46.312
far from Rome.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.698
You and I, however--

22:48.868 --> 22:51.484
we have fashioned wings
to raise us higher

22:51.663 --> 22:53.324
than the muck and mire
of heritage,

22:53.498 --> 22:56.080
higher than our fathers
could ever imagine.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.039
Quintus.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.170
What stirs such a vision
from her dreams?

23:03.341 --> 23:06.629
My husband
not beside me.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.590
Spartacus was helping me
hone my game.

23:09.764 --> 23:12.506
Over a cup of wine?

23:12.684 --> 23:15.346
( chuckles )

23:17.855 --> 23:19.982
Gratitude for the instruction.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.524
Have your senses flown,

23:27.699 --> 23:29.564
to share drink with a slave?

23:29.742 --> 23:32.119
| drink with the champion
of Capua.

23:32.287 --> 23:33.868
Crixus was a champion,

23:34.038 --> 23:36.324
yet no cup was ever raised
with him.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.706
Crixus is a brute.

23:38.876 --> 23:40.741
Spartacus is different.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.629
We owe our good fortune
to the man.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.461
He's beneath you.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.377
And tomorrow we play hosts
to Capua's finest.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.261
Such behavior
would be spat upon.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.799
They spit only
to stroke their own cocks.

23:55.977 --> 23:59.390
Spartacus is the reason
the magistrate graces our house,

23:59.564 --> 24:01.304
along with all the shits
that follow.

24:01.482 --> 24:05.521
They come to see you,

24:05.695 --> 24:08.232
a man ascended
to the heavens.

24:08.406 --> 24:12.399
And Spartacus is merely
the beast that you ride upon.

24:15.204 --> 24:15.238
You and Varro fought
as if brothers.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.737
You and Varro fought
as if brothers.

24:17.915 --> 24:20.372
Your victory
was a glorious sight.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.659
Man: Did you see the key,
huh? Huh?

24:22.837 --> 24:24.418
Don't suppose you know
anything about that?

24:24.589 --> 24:26.079
- Spartacus.
- Still your tongue.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.293
What grievance
has the woman given?

24:28.468 --> 24:31.335
- None which concerns you.
- She is known to me.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.594
This one is known
to every cock in the villa.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.096
Move off.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.097
Tell me her grievance!

24:37.268 --> 24:39.759
I gave you command.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.187
(screaming )

24:43.358 --> 24:46.350
Spartacus!
What is the fucking meaning of this?

24:46.527 --> 24:48.392
Speak.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.778
Your man attacks Mira
without cause.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.610
What reason have you for laying hands
on one of my slaves?

24:54.911 --> 24:56.276
The girl is a thief.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.319
I stole nothing.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.786
What exactly do you believe
she has stolen?

25:04.879 --> 25:06.335
Nothing of worth.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.001
Go.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.886
You overstep.
A month's wages forfeited.

25:16.057 --> 25:17.638
Press further

25:17.809 --> 25:19.549
and coin will be replaced
by blood.

25:19.727 --> 25:20.933
Remove yourself.

25:21.104 --> 25:22.844
Dominus.

25:25.775 --> 25:26.981
Apologies.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.642
Do not fucking speak!

25:29.821 --> 25:32.233
l defend your worth to my wife,
only to turn and find you

25:32.407 --> 25:34.147
shitting in my
fucking house.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.657
If the toga virilis
were not tomorrow,

25:36.828 --> 25:38.318
lwould have you lashed

25:38.496 --> 25:40.327
until the flesh peeled
from your back.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.830
Lay hands on one
of my guards again,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.833
and you will receive
far worse.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.716
Dominus.

26:00.351 --> 26:03.013
You attack a guard,
yet escape punishment?

26:04.564 --> 26:07.055
Being champion
is not without advantage.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.225
I must remember to stay
close to your side.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.030
Perhaps a swath of your good fortune
will rub off on me.

26:17.785 --> 26:21.323
Your efforts would be better focused
protecting your flank.

26:21.497 --> 26:25.115
Oh fuck.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.409
(laughing)

26:27.587 --> 26:30.044
Magistrate Calavius,

26:30.214 --> 26:31.954
the House of Batiatus
welcomes you

26:32.133 --> 26:33.873
on this glorious day--

26:34.051 --> 26:36.463
a young boy enters my doors,
but leaves a man.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.094
Gratitude for your hospitalities.
We are in your debt.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.801
As are we all.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.307
llithyia.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.218
l'd begun to fear
for your health.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.852
A momentary lapse.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.059
I've been tended to
with most compassionate care

26:49.233 --> 26:51.098
within these walls.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.189
- Where are the gladiators?
- Numerius.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.695
He couldn't sleep last night
for excitement.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.481
Batiatus: Who can blame him,
to stand among

26:58.659 --> 27:01.241
the greatest titans of the republic,
his to command?

27:01.412 --> 27:03.243
Mine? Really?

27:03.414 --> 27:05.279
Each of my proud warriors
has been instructed

27:05.458 --> 27:07.744
to regard your orders
as if from my own lips.

27:07.919 --> 27:10.080
Flavius will be filled
with great envy.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.745
As he should,
even more so when he hears

27:12.924 --> 27:15.290
the champion of Capua
himself

27:15.468 --> 27:17.834
- has given you a tour of the ludus.
- Spartacus?

27:18.012 --> 27:20.754
He awaits your presence,
with the permission of your father.

27:20.932 --> 27:24.595
I would have better fortune
reining Apollo's horses.

27:24.769 --> 27:28.603
Guards, escort young Numerius
to the training square.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.606
I've never seen him
in higher spirits.

27:32.777 --> 27:34.768
The House of Batiatus
has such an effect.

27:34.946 --> 27:37.813
Have you ever witnessed
a view from their balcony?

27:37.990 --> 27:40.242
It simply overwhelms
the senses.

27:40.409 --> 27:44.243
Come, let us gaze upon
Capua's perfection.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.199
And give the men
a private moment

27:46.374 --> 27:49.286
to discuss how ravishing
their women are.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.125
llithyia resides with you?

27:55.299 --> 27:57.961
For the moment,
a valued friend.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.717
With connection to the senate
in both husband and father--

28:00.888 --> 28:02.094
value indeed.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.802
One must choose one's company
with exceeding care.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.262
Or else be dragged down
by them.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.927
Preparations are
in order?

28:10.106 --> 28:12.722
Set as if the boy was my own.
Ease all concern.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.686
This night
will be etched

28:14.861 --> 28:17.193
in the memories
of all in attendance.

28:19.782 --> 28:21.898
What is it like
having the life of another

28:22.076 --> 28:23.486
resting in your hands?

28:23.661 --> 28:27.449
My sword may deliver
the final blow,

28:27.623 --> 28:29.488
but a gladiator's fate
is for the crowd

28:29.667 --> 28:32.124
and the editor
to decide.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.506
You have no wall
over by the cliff.

28:38.676 --> 28:42.214
The very reason I find it best
not to train there.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.424
Has anyone
ever fallen below?

28:44.599 --> 28:46.555
l've witnessed but one.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.466
Come.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.135
It's been a long time
since last we trained.

28:51.314 --> 28:53.726
Let us see
what you remember.

29:07.288 --> 29:10.872
The magistrate's son
graces our sands,

29:11.042 --> 29:13.328
and this is
what greets him?

29:15.671 --> 29:19.255
Would that I had an opponent
worthy of his interest.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.547
I would spar with you.

29:24.722 --> 29:27.179
I meant a real gladiator.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.808
Crixus shows
impeccable form.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.567
Hmm.

29:40.738 --> 29:43.730
I shall prove otherwise
at your ceremony tonight.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.866
Anyone else
dare challenge?

29:51.082 --> 29:52.743
Our fight
is not yet finished.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.078
Stand down, pup,

29:55.252 --> 29:57.288
before your shriveling cock
wets the sand.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.881
The man is beaten.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.765
ln body, perhaps.

30:13.771 --> 30:18.140
A confrontation
is often not won by force,

30:18.317 --> 30:20.148
but by will.

30:49.724 --> 30:52.466
Stay down,
you ignorant shit.

31:03.112 --> 31:05.694
Enough!

31:30.681 --> 31:33.343
The man is soundly defeated,
yet treated as victor.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.926
A sign of respect

31:37.104 --> 31:38.685
for his courage.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.097
Doctore:
See him to the medicus.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.610
ls every day like this?

31:50.785 --> 31:52.366
( laughs)

32:00.461 --> 32:03.168
l was unaware you possessed
such a skilled hand at latrunculi.

32:03.339 --> 32:06.172
Well, I consider myself
a student of military strategy.

32:06.342 --> 32:09.755
To win one must maneuver
to catch one's opponent unawares.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.045
As it is in war,

32:12.223 --> 32:15.556
so it is in politics.

32:15.726 --> 32:18.809
Another subject
of my interest.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.641
- Perhaps--
- Numerius: Father!

32:21.816 --> 32:24.023
Spartacus gave me his sword
so I could practice.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.808
Numerius, you are filthy.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.897
Calavius: I fear he will form a crust
if not sent to water.

32:28.072 --> 32:30.905
No, we shall see him well prepared
before the guests arrive.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.532
Naevia, escort Numerius
to the baths.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.442
Yes, Domina.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.873
Just through here.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.956
There is yet
much the boy in him.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.338
For but a moment longer.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.750
Tonight Numerius
becomes a man.

33:02.439 --> 33:03.645
Clean?

33:05.317 --> 33:06.932
Or do you yet require
a hard scrubbing?

33:07.111 --> 33:09.602
No, I am--

33:09.780 --> 33:10.986
I am--

33:11.157 --> 33:12.647
( laughs)

33:12.825 --> 33:15.111
Yes, you are.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.910
Nothing more sensual
than a warm bath...

33:21.625 --> 33:25.664
mm, the water
caressing your skin.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.839
Your eyes seem
rather fixed.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.466
Apologies.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.012
None required.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.967
This is your night,
Numerius,

33:37.141 --> 33:40.725
one that occurs but once
in a man's lifetime.

33:40.895 --> 33:42.726
I am filled
with much excitement.

33:42.897 --> 33:44.478
Of course you are.

33:44.648 --> 33:48.015
Your life unfolds
before you--

33:48.194 --> 33:51.652
many glories,
many honors,

33:51.822 --> 33:54.939
many pleasures.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.699
The choices
you make tonight

33:57.870 --> 33:59.656
will ripple through time,

33:59.830 --> 34:03.163
altering fates and destinies.

34:03.334 --> 34:06.497
So much rests
in your hands.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.162
And I would see them
properly filled.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.969
Woman: Mm, very nice.

35:03.143 --> 35:06.601
Then you jump up
and stab him down like that.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.305
A fine celebration, Batiatus.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.600
I've never seen the boy
so happy.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.485
Let us call him a boy
nolongen

35:15.656 --> 35:17.942
Does he not
appear to you a man?

35:21.495 --> 35:24.282
He does seem to stand taller,
does he not?

35:24.456 --> 35:26.242
By quite some measure.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.533
Soon he will rival the stature
of his honored father.

35:28.711 --> 35:30.747
It gives great pride
to know

35:30.921 --> 35:33.207
l have such an heir
to carry the name Calavius.

35:33.382 --> 35:36.249
Every house
should be so blessed.

35:36.427 --> 35:39.214
I believe your son will do
extraordinary things.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.755
l for one cannot wait
to see them.

35:53.736 --> 35:57.228
It appears the wife of the legatus
yet harbors a grudge.

35:57.406 --> 36:00.944
She is a cat absent claws.

36:01.118 --> 36:03.609
Varro: Yet fangs remain.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.238
Gratitude for last night.

36:08.417 --> 36:11.033
The man overstepped.

36:12.296 --> 36:13.957
l merely made correction.

36:14.131 --> 36:16.247
Still,

36:16.425 --> 36:18.290
the heart swells
at such kindness.

36:18.469 --> 36:20.300
Then see it deflate.

36:20.471 --> 36:23.008
I would have done the same
for any woman.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.632
You are an ass.

36:26.810 --> 36:29.973
(Varro snickering )

36:30.147 --> 36:32.980
The champion of Capua,
always making friends.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.141
I need but one.

36:35.319 --> 36:38.652
Fortunate, since it appears
one is all you have.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.321
Herhusband
is mad with worry.

36:48.499 --> 36:50.455
Licinia has
completely vanished.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.834
She slipped away in the night
absent slaves and not seen since.

36:54.004 --> 36:56.962
A proper woman should never
travel without escort.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.838
Her cousin good Crassus
has offered

36:59.009 --> 37:01.000
substantial reward
for her discovery,

37:01.178 --> 37:03.544
larger still towards punishment
if harm's been done.

37:03.722 --> 37:07.135
But who would wish such a thing
upon a relation of Crassus?

37:07.309 --> 37:08.719
Why, that would be
madness.

37:08.894 --> 37:12.978
It is revelation what we are capable of
when pushed to brink.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.354
Or pulled.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.860
Well, there can only be one cause
to slip out in the night

37:20.030 --> 37:21.895
absent slaves or husbands.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.860
Oh.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.411
She is married
to a fat little man

37:26.578 --> 37:28.534
who sprouts hair
as if beast.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.570
(women laughing )

37:30.749 --> 37:32.535
Who could blame her,

37:32.709 --> 37:35.542
flown to the arms of another,
as Helen to Paris?

37:37.923 --> 37:40.414
Solonius: I fear Rome must be
absent her beauty,

37:40.592 --> 37:42.799
for tonight
the jewels of the republic

37:42.970 --> 37:46.007
stand glittering before me
in Capua.

37:46.181 --> 37:49.673
Good Solonius,
you decided to attend.

37:49.852 --> 37:51.968
Who could resist
such divine company?

37:52.146 --> 37:54.011
Batiatus:
Do my eyes deceive?

37:54.189 --> 37:56.771
Solonius, come from
the shadow to the light,

37:56.942 --> 37:58.728
embrace me as brother.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.439
Would that blood
were our bond.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.774
I almost did not
recognize you,

38:03.949 --> 38:05.564
so gaunt of cheek.

38:05.742 --> 38:08.404
- Are you quite well?
- My health has never been better.

38:08.579 --> 38:11.412
Sadly the same can't be said
for your fortunes in the arena, huh?

38:11.582 --> 38:13.994
Have you had opportunity
to greet the magistrate?

38:14.168 --> 38:16.580
He was deep in conference
with the consularis when I arrived.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.618
As the evening wears,
I am certain

38:18.797 --> 38:21.083
he will find time
for the less significant guests.

38:21.258 --> 38:23.874
Gratitude for the invitation.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.259
I hope soon to return
the favor.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.259
Did you see the look
upon his face?

38:30.434 --> 38:33.676
He has the rictus of a man dying
a slice at a time.

38:33.854 --> 38:37.142
Lucretia: I would have the fatal cut
in a single stroke.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.557
Oh, I prefer as many strokes
as possible,

38:39.735 --> 38:42.147
to maximize the pleasure.

38:52.331 --> 38:55.949
l was unaware you had taste
for such exotic treats.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.460
We cannot be
seen together.

39:00.631 --> 39:04.374
| find it curious that Batiatus
would extend me invitation.

39:04.551 --> 39:07.258
What is he planning?

39:08.305 --> 39:11.638
To humiliate you
before the magistrate.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.345
Your master swims
in deep waters.

39:14.520 --> 39:18.104
Someday soon he shall disappear
beneath the waves.

39:20.317 --> 39:20.942
Come, gather,
esteemed guests

39:20.943 --> 39:23.480
Come, gather,
esteemed guests

39:23.654 --> 39:28.193
and those of a more
questionable repute.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.733
Tonight the House of Batiatus
is humbled

39:30.911 --> 39:33.869
to help celebrate
a most glorious occasion.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.870
The son
of Magistrate Calavius

39:36.041 --> 39:39.454
casts off the robes of a boy

39:39.628 --> 39:42.335
and becomes
a proper Roman man.

39:47.553 --> 39:50.511
Yet before he dons
the toga virilis,

39:50.681 --> 39:53.013
let us honor him

39:53.183 --> 39:56.175
with sport and blood,

39:56.353 --> 39:59.516
a contest between the present
and the past.

39:59.690 --> 40:03.899
Spartacus, champion of Capua,

40:04.069 --> 40:06.481
step forward.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.191
Crixus, former champion, step--

40:12.369 --> 40:14.325
Wait.

40:14.496 --> 40:17.363
I fear Crixus has seen
his best day passed.

40:19.126 --> 40:22.209
I would have Varro
fight in his place.

40:28.385 --> 40:30.876
You are the editor,
young master,

40:31.054 --> 40:33.090
your will our hands.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.264
Varro, step forward.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.847
( applause )

40:42.399 --> 40:44.390
Did you have hand
in my elevation?

40:44.568 --> 40:46.980
The boy's change
comes a surprise.

40:50.741 --> 40:53.448
It seems the gods
favor us both now.

40:54.703 --> 40:56.409
Honor the boy.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.286
Honor the ludus.

41:01.293 --> 41:03.875
Numerius insults Crixus
in our own house.

41:04.046 --> 41:05.456
Let it pass.

41:05.631 --> 41:09.044
The magistrate's happiness
is our only concern.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.798
Come, Numerius.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.301
These men, these titans of the arena
await your command.

41:17.309 --> 41:18.924
Begin.

42:18.328 --> 42:21.320
( crowd exclaims, laughter)

42:24.334 --> 42:25.995
My fucking flank.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.750
Protect it,

42:27.921 --> 42:30.833
and next time it may be you
who stands victorious.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.632
Batiatus: Spartacus--
still the champion of Capua.

42:37.806 --> 42:40.218
And Varro--
a formidable opponent,

42:40.392 --> 42:42.849
one to watch closely
in the arena.

42:43.019 --> 42:44.225
Come, Numerius,

42:44.396 --> 42:47.388
pass judgment
on our fallen warrior.

42:52.571 --> 42:55.187
( crowd exclaims )

43:09.171 --> 43:12.379
Apologies, Magistrate, it was agreed
this was an exhibition only,

43:12.549 --> 43:14.164
not a fight to the death.

43:14.342 --> 43:16.207
There must be blood.

43:16.386 --> 43:18.422
Father.

43:18.597 --> 43:21.304
Numerius has made
his decision.

43:22.768 --> 43:25.384
I will reimburse you
the cost of the man.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.566
Proceed.

43:48.877 --> 43:51.539
Do we have a problem,
Batiatus?

44:01.097 --> 44:03.349
I said proceed.

44:20.283 --> 44:21.944
Varro: Don't.

44:26.623 --> 44:29.114
Don't.

44:29.292 --> 44:31.453
They will kill us both.

44:33.672 --> 44:36.129
There is no choice.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.291
There is always a choice.

44:42.806 --> 44:45.548
Not this time.

44:49.062 --> 44:51.724
Spartacus.

45:08.999 --> 45:11.160
Live

45:11.334 --> 45:13.165
and see my family
provided for.

45:15.005 --> 45:16.916
And know

45:17.090 --> 45:19.126
I would have done the same.

46:06.139 --> 46:08.926
( applause )

46:35.627 --> 46:39.711
I am forever indebted
to your hospitality, Batiatus.

46:39.881 --> 46:42.623
Think nothing of it.
A favor for a dear friend.

46:42.801 --> 46:44.666
He calls for blood
without hesitation.

46:44.844 --> 46:47.881
Such boldness will one day
lead him to the senate.

46:49.599 --> 46:51.260
The noblest of ambitions.

46:51.434 --> 46:54.471
I myself have designs
towards political office.

46:54.646 --> 46:55.886
Is that so?

46:56.064 --> 46:58.271
Well, not the senate, not so soon,
but something local.

46:58.441 --> 47:00.818
I would speak to you of support,
perhaps tomorrow.

47:00.986 --> 47:02.442
I leave for the coast
on business.

47:02.612 --> 47:04.944
Well, when you return then.

47:06.491 --> 47:09.858
Politics is too dull
for a man of your persuasion.

47:10.036 --> 47:12.778
You would ache for the sights
and sounds of the arena.

47:12.956 --> 47:16.949
A sacrifice I would gladly make
in the service to Rome.

47:19.212 --> 47:21.794
Batiatus, you are
a fine lanista,

47:21.965 --> 47:24.297
perhaps the finest
in all the republic,

47:24.467 --> 47:28.085
but politics--
it requires a different sort.

47:28.263 --> 47:32.131
Solonius: Citizens of status,
with the proper heritage.

47:32.308 --> 47:34.344
Calavius: Just so.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.680
Relish what you know best.

47:36.855 --> 47:39.813
Leave politics to the men
with breeding for it.

47:39.983 --> 47:41.814
Come, good Solonius.

47:41.985 --> 47:44.567
We have not had occasion
to speak this evening.

47:47.657 --> 47:50.114
The magistrate's response?

47:51.161 --> 47:53.243
To be answered in blood.

49:55.368 --> 49:57.700
(theme music playing )
