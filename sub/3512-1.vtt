WEBVTT

00:00.654 --> 00:01.980
Previously on "Castle"...

00:02.243 --> 00:04.286
You're a good candidate for the opening

00:04.287 --> 00:06.225
on the A.G. investigative team.

00:06.226 --> 00:08.963
Opportunities like this come
along once in a lifetime.

00:08.964 --> 00:10.298
We're in this relationship,

00:10.299 --> 00:12.806
but we never talk about where we're going.

00:12.807 --> 00:15.842
- But if I get that job...
- Then you're gonna have to.

00:15.843 --> 00:19.197
I didn't tell you about it
because you would be upset.

00:19.395 --> 00:20.318
Yeah.

00:20.659 --> 00:22.151
Yeah. You're damn right I'm upset.

00:22.152 --> 00:25.702
You get this job, you move
to D.C., I'll never see you.

00:25.703 --> 00:28.161
That's pretty much the
end of our relationship.

00:29.527 --> 00:30.705
What are you gonna do?

00:30.967 --> 00:32.256
I don't know, dad.

00:32.583 --> 00:35.374
This job... it's what I want.

00:35.375 --> 00:38.732
I know you say you love her, but, darling,

00:38.733 --> 00:41.509
is it possible that the
reason you have held back

00:41.510 --> 00:43.791
is because somewhere deep down inside,

00:44.085 --> 00:47.455
you don't think this is gonna really work?

00:48.469 --> 00:50.250
I've been doing a lot of thinking about us.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.085
I've decided I want more.

00:52.491 --> 00:54.038
We both deserve more.

00:55.019 --> 00:56.586
And whatever you decide,

00:56.587 --> 00:58.357
Katherine Houghton Beckett...

01:00.123 --> 01:01.365
will you marry me?

01:07.580 --> 01:09.365
Oh, my God!

01:09.676 --> 01:11.347
Oh, my God. You're proposing.

01:11.348 --> 01:13.832
- Okay. You're surprised.
- Of course I'm surprised.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.388
I thought you were breaking up with me.

01:15.389 --> 01:16.540
By offering you a ring?

01:16.541 --> 01:18.171
Well, you just... you seemed so serious.

01:18.172 --> 01:19.256
Yeah, of course I'm serious.

01:19.257 --> 01:22.194
- This is the most serious thing I've ever done.
- Good.

01:25.416 --> 01:26.626
So that's a "yes"?

01:26.648 --> 01:28.038
- No, wait.
- "No"?

01:28.039 --> 01:30.369
- No, no, no, not... not "no."
- So "yes"?

01:30.647 --> 01:32.258
- I...
- Not "yes"?

01:32.259 --> 01:34.154
No. Not "not yes."

01:34.155 --> 01:35.813
I... I...

01:35.979 --> 01:38.101
You do know how this works, right?

01:38.331 --> 01:39.909
There's something that I have to tell you.

01:42.283 --> 01:43.675
I got the job.

01:43.676 --> 01:44.741
In D.C.?

01:45.980 --> 01:47.509
Castle, I love you.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.765
But this is my shot.

01:52.526 --> 01:55.236
And if I don't do this,
I'll always regret it.

01:55.739 --> 01:57.879
Look, if this changes anything for you,

01:57.880 --> 01:59.658
if this changes the way that you feel...

01:59.659 --> 02:02.902
Kate, I'm not proposing
to you to keep you here

02:03.115 --> 02:05.406
or because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you.

02:05.407 --> 02:09.080
I'm proposing because I can't
imagine my life without you.

02:09.519 --> 02:10.842
If that means when things get difficult,

02:10.842 --> 02:11.886
we have to figure them out,

02:11.887 --> 02:14.422
then I'm willing to figure them out,

02:14.423 --> 02:18.410
assuming you're willing
to figure them out with me.

02:20.399 --> 02:21.753
Well, in that case,

02:22.032 --> 02:25.006
Richard Edgar Alexander Rodgers Castle,

02:25.007 --> 02:26.057
yes.

02:26.351 --> 02:29.130
Yes. I will marry you.

02:37.007 --> 02:38.702
It's big.

02:38.703 --> 02:41.353
No, you just have remarkably tiny fingers.

02:45.807 --> 02:47.897
We're gonna be able to
make this work, right?

02:48.640 --> 02:49.881
We're gonna be great.

02:50.527 --> 02:52.547
D.C. is gonna be great.

02:52.548 --> 02:53.598
I promise.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:06.889 --> 03:07.971
Look out!

03:15.899 --> 03:17.594
Federal agent!

03:17.994 --> 03:20.308
Come out with your hands on your head!

03:27.674 --> 03:29.476
Put your weapon on the ground.

03:31.001 --> 03:33.975
- Do it!
- Okay. All right. Nobody needs to get hurt.

03:33.976 --> 03:34.930
Okay?

03:36.091 --> 03:38.882
I'm gonna put it down and
I'm gonna slide it over.

03:44.312 --> 03:45.315
Okay?

03:46.452 --> 03:47.841
Okay, here it comes.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.151
You okay, ma'am?

04:01.943 --> 04:03.567
I'm fine.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.230
Beckett!

04:17.382 --> 04:18.575
Agent Beckett?

04:20.297 --> 04:21.540
Congratulations.

04:21.541 --> 04:24.084
Because of you, the Chechens now
have our nuclear launch codes.

04:24.085 --> 04:25.167
Nice job.

04:28.789 --> 04:29.935
Damn it.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.814
You didn't find it odd that
the hostage wasn't struggling?

04:34.815 --> 04:36.770
She had a gun held to her head.

04:36.771 --> 04:38.770
And she didn't cry out for help. Why?

04:38.771 --> 04:41.047
Because she didn't wanna
give away her accent. Fine.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.069
But the intel said that
the operative worked alone.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.651
And that's the point of the exercise.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.354
Intel is sometimes wrong.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.873
You have to use your
judgment, your instinct,

04:49.874 --> 04:52.186
because the analyst that's
gathering that intel...

04:52.187 --> 04:53.938
he's not the one that's
gonna be catching a bullet.

04:53.939 --> 04:56.352
That's gonna be you, or worse, me.

04:56.353 --> 04:57.848
Now step up your game.

04:57.870 --> 04:58.907
McCord!

05:04.254 --> 05:05.496
Hostage alley?

05:05.603 --> 05:06.616
Yeah.

05:06.894 --> 05:10.034
Don't feel bad. Everyone screws that up.

05:10.035 --> 05:11.094
- Should've seen it.
- Hey, look,

05:11.095 --> 05:13.779
it's better to die in training
than in the field, right?

05:13.780 --> 05:16.246
- It's better not to die at all.
- Yeah.

05:17.138 --> 05:19.326
Listen, a few of us are
grabbing a beer tonight.

05:19.327 --> 05:20.171
You wanna join?

05:20.172 --> 05:21.857
Thank you, Hendricks. I would love to,

05:21.858 --> 05:25.042
but with the caseload and the training,

05:25.043 --> 05:26.785
I haven't had a weekend off in ages,

05:26.786 --> 05:28.444
and I've actually got plans.

05:28.674 --> 05:29.304
Not anymore.

05:29.305 --> 05:31.860
We just received a priority 7 from the A.G.

05:31.944 --> 05:33.367
There's been an incident...

05:33.368 --> 05:35.714
a potential national security breach.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.031
Ah, the prodigal son returns.

05:41.032 --> 05:42.803
How was the west coast book tour?

05:42.804 --> 05:44.868
It was exhausting.

05:44.869 --> 05:47.407
12 cities in 11 days.

05:47.408 --> 05:49.516
I signed my fingers to the bone.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.229
- You poor boy. Mm.
- Mwah.

05:51.230 --> 05:51.891
I'm gonna go change.

05:51.892 --> 05:54.239
I'll let this guy fill
you in on all the details.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.474
He's best with rhetorical questions.

05:57.392 --> 05:58.889
- Is Alexis back?
- Ah, yeah.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.405
She came in this morning.

06:00.406 --> 06:01.973
Oh, I thought she was
in Costa Rica until...

06:01.974 --> 06:03.839
Next week. Surprise!

06:03.840 --> 06:04.907
Daddy?

06:05.236 --> 06:05.806
Hi!

06:05.807 --> 06:08.169
Oh. Mm. Come here, you.

06:08.335 --> 06:10.052
How was your trip?

06:10.533 --> 06:11.898
Amazing.

06:11.899 --> 06:13.797
Just wait till you see our pictures.

06:14.028 --> 06:15.221
"Our" pictures?

06:15.356 --> 06:17.658
Hey, Al, where do you keep the matches?

06:17.659 --> 06:19.477
I wanna light these sage bundles.

06:21.051 --> 06:22.741
Surprise again.

06:23.259 --> 06:24.107
Dad...

06:24.108 --> 06:25.222
Pi.

06:25.325 --> 06:27.243
Pi, dad.

06:27.244 --> 06:28.823
Hey, Mr. C.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.834
Awesome to meet you.

06:33.985 --> 06:36.973
Pie. Like the dessert?

06:36.974 --> 06:39.581
Without the "E." Like the Greek letter.

06:39.582 --> 06:40.459
But personally, I feel

06:40.460 --> 06:43.078
the whole spelling thing
just stifles creativity.

06:44.032 --> 06:44.823
The "spelling thing"?

06:44.824 --> 06:47.837
Let's let my dad decompress.
Matches are in the kitchen.

06:47.838 --> 06:48.824
Okay.

06:51.758 --> 06:53.501
He's... he's not staying here?

06:53.502 --> 06:55.320
Oh, he is.

06:56.964 --> 06:58.991
N... not in her room.

06:59.395 --> 07:01.290
Hey, you get to have that talk.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.957
I have a class. Ta-ta.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.050
Uh, Alexis?

07:10.629 --> 07:12.339
Could I talk to you a second?

07:16.530 --> 07:17.921
Give him a chance, dad.

07:17.922 --> 07:18.632
I really like him.

07:18.633 --> 07:20.084
And he's brilliant.

07:21.018 --> 07:22.116
Found 'em!

07:22.942 --> 07:24.355
We'll talk about this later.

07:26.634 --> 07:28.480
Uh, make sure you put some, uh,

07:28.481 --> 07:31.700
blankets out on the couch
for Pi if he's staying?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.246
Want him to be comfortable...

07:33.321 --> 07:34.750
and visible.

07:36.357 --> 07:38.643
Please tell me your flight is not delayed.

07:38.644 --> 07:41.283
I don't think I can bear
another minute not seeing you.

07:41.284 --> 07:43.982
I'm sorry. I'm not at the airport.

07:44.979 --> 07:46.176
You're not coming, are you?

07:46.177 --> 07:48.513
I just got put on a priority case.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.812
Kate, we haven't seen
each other in six weeks.

07:50.914 --> 07:52.774
Trust me. This was not my call.

07:52.775 --> 07:54.319
I'm just as upset as you are.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.235
No, I know. It's...

07:56.465 --> 07:58.231
I'm the one who canceled last time.

07:58.232 --> 08:00.374
Beckett, let's go.

08:00.375 --> 08:01.219
Look, I gotta go.

08:01.220 --> 08:03.017
I will make this up to you, I promise.

08:03.018 --> 08:04.293
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

08:04.294 --> 08:05.442
Okay. I love you.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.910
Love you, too. Bye.

08:06.911 --> 08:07.913
Bye.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.953
What are you smiling about?

08:49.331 --> 08:51.731
Can you at least finish taking
that off before you shoot me?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.157
Cas... Castle?

08:55.155 --> 08:56.541
What are you doing here?

08:56.711 --> 08:59.271
I know I promised to respect your job,

08:59.272 --> 09:01.135
but I couldn't go another
week without seeing you.

09:01.136 --> 09:03.338
You... you shouldn't have come here.

09:03.601 --> 09:04.751
So you want me to leave?

09:04.752 --> 09:06.234
Oh, immediately.

09:09.277 --> 09:10.519
Oh, God.

09:19.997 --> 09:20.718
Hey.

09:20.719 --> 09:21.901
How long have you been up?

09:21.902 --> 09:24.775
Hey. Couple of hours. I
had some homework to do.

09:24.925 --> 09:27.208
Maybe we should do some homework, too.

09:28.172 --> 09:29.375
Yeah, I would love to,

09:29.376 --> 09:30.958
except I'm still proving myself.

09:30.959 --> 09:32.082
I got to know these reports

09:32.083 --> 09:33.573
better than the people that wrote them.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.453
Is this your case?

09:34.454 --> 09:36.497
- Yeah.
- What's it about?

09:38.006 --> 09:39.040
Castle.

09:39.318 --> 09:40.624
It's classified.

09:41.094 --> 09:43.809
You do realize that only
makes me more curious.

09:43.810 --> 09:46.030
So... is it big?

09:46.707 --> 09:48.083
You know I can't talk about it.

09:48.084 --> 09:49.012
Doesn't mean I can't guess.

09:49.013 --> 09:51.078
It must be big. You had to
cancel our weekend together.

09:51.079 --> 09:53.793
Must be local, because you're still here.

09:54.551 --> 09:56.008
I bet I can figure this out.

09:56.009 --> 09:57.811
Well, that doesn't mean that you should.

09:57.849 --> 10:00.431
Come on. Don't you miss working together?

10:00.432 --> 10:01.818
Yes, I do.

10:01.841 --> 10:06.363
So if I were to help you,
maybe we could solve whatever...

10:06.560 --> 10:08.570
this is faster,

10:08.899 --> 10:10.371
and then have the whole
weekend to ourselves.

10:10.372 --> 10:13.248
- Wouldn't you like that?
- I would...

10:13.924 --> 10:15.990
until I got arrested for disclosing

10:15.991 --> 10:17.959
classified information.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.683
Oh, come on. Who's gonna know?

10:20.441 --> 10:21.632
Wow. They're good.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.291
I gotta go. That's my partner.

10:24.237 --> 10:26.463
- Oh.
- Sorry. No, no. I got it. I got it.

10:26.464 --> 10:27.530
I'm not looking.

10:28.335 --> 10:29.418
So what time will you be back?

10:29.419 --> 10:30.822
I... you know what? I'm not quite sure.

10:30.823 --> 10:32.669
I'll give you a call...

10:32.670 --> 10:34.296
as soon as I find out.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.305
Hey, come on in.

10:35.306 --> 10:36.895
- Hey. Are you ready?
- Uh, yeah.

10:36.896 --> 10:38.282
I just gotta get my bag.

10:43.168 --> 10:43.809
Yeah.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.284
He is, except he knows that we're working.

10:47.156 --> 10:49.235
Uh, Castle, this is Rachel McCord.

10:49.236 --> 10:50.608
She's my new partner.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.378
So you're the new partner.

10:52.379 --> 10:53.541
Yep.

10:54.507 --> 10:56.288
Chief's waiting. Gotta go.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.355
Yeah.

10:58.768 --> 11:00.221
- Bye.
- Bye. Mwah.

11:02.852 --> 11:04.120
Have fun saving the...

11:04.121 --> 11:05.043
world.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.195
Oh, you forgot your, um...

11:30.084 --> 11:32.532
All right. Now...

11:38.208 --> 11:38.971
Seriously?

11:38.972 --> 11:41.542
Only four months away. I wanna be ready.

11:41.683 --> 11:43.677
It's gonna be a long four months.

11:46.931 --> 11:47.735
Esposito.

11:47.736 --> 11:49.234
'Sito! It's me.

11:49.235 --> 11:51.309
Castle? I'll put you on speaker.

11:52.867 --> 11:53.796
So where you been, bro?

11:53.797 --> 11:55.164
You've missed, like, three "Halo" nights.

11:55.165 --> 11:56.330
I told you, I was on a book tour.

11:56.331 --> 11:57.399
Yeah? Did you tell your book groupies

11:57.400 --> 11:58.802
you're engaged now?

11:59.144 --> 12:01.394
You're swaddling that
doll right now, aren't you?

12:02.825 --> 12:04.570
So listen, we just finished a case.

12:04.571 --> 12:05.616
Come have a drink with us after work.

12:05.617 --> 12:08.142
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm working
on a case of my own right now...

12:08.143 --> 12:09.550
for my next book.

12:09.551 --> 12:11.205
Oh, so you just called us

12:11.206 --> 12:13.277
'cause you need some
expert technical consulting.

12:13.278 --> 12:15.320
Well, s-since you offered.

12:16.222 --> 12:17.484
I'm writing a scene about someone

12:17.485 --> 12:19.600
trying to investigate a crime

12:19.601 --> 12:21.668
using only one evidence photo...

12:21.669 --> 12:24.394
a crime involving national security.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.043
So your hero's a spy?

12:26.044 --> 12:29.621
More like a... ruggedly handsome everyman.

12:29.691 --> 12:32.409
Anyway, the photo is
of a blown transformer,

12:32.410 --> 12:35.986
so I pulled a random photo of
a transformer off the Internet,

12:36.040 --> 12:37.713
and there's a serial number on the side.

12:37.714 --> 12:39.553
I'm trying to determine how much

12:39.554 --> 12:42.764
my character could figure
out just from that number.

12:42.898 --> 12:44.169
I'm wondering if my character's

12:44.170 --> 12:46.864
police buddies might have any... resources.

12:46.865 --> 12:48.977
Well, if your hero's fictional cop buddies

12:48.978 --> 12:50.945
are anything like your real cop buddies,

12:50.946 --> 12:53.499
then they'd have real
work to get back to, so...

12:53.500 --> 12:57.974
- Bye-bye now.- What if... our hero
was offering Knicks floor seats?

13:00.828 --> 13:01.694
What's that serial number?

13:01.695 --> 13:02.633
Here.

13:03.167 --> 13:07.081
A-P-5-7-3-9-2-1-5.

13:07.951 --> 13:11.005
Here we go. The "A-P"
stands for Allegra Power.

13:11.006 --> 13:12.925
They service Northern Virginia.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.343
And would it be possible
to trace the location

13:15.344 --> 13:16.804
of that transformer using that number?

13:16.805 --> 13:18.047
Yeah, sure.

13:18.326 --> 13:20.750
The transformer with that
serial number controls

13:20.751 --> 13:22.033
a 10-square block region

13:22.034 --> 13:25.341
of the Ashton Heights
neighborhood in Arlington.

13:25.650 --> 13:28.972
Thanks, you guys. You saved the story.

13:29.346 --> 13:31.629
Whoa. Guys, that exact transformer

13:31.630 --> 13:33.560
was sabotaged two nights ago,

13:33.663 --> 13:35.752
and the feds are investigating.

13:35.790 --> 13:38.472
Arlington? Isn't that Beckett's backyard?

13:39.103 --> 13:40.047
Castle.

13:40.048 --> 13:41.369
Is this a real case?

13:42.830 --> 13:45.370
Well, actually, I... what?

13:45.499 --> 13:47.562
Tunnel... right... m... m...

13:47.563 --> 13:48.740
call... later... when I...

13:48.741 --> 13:49.903
b...

13:52.644 --> 13:53.774
Smooth.

13:54.836 --> 13:55.950
All right.

13:57.255 --> 13:59.216
Why would someone blow up a transformer?

14:00.534 --> 14:01.681
Terrorism.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.903
No, that would have been in the news.

14:04.438 --> 14:05.920
To cause a blackout?

14:06.966 --> 14:09.952
How does a blackout
affect national security?

14:10.822 --> 14:12.558
The blackout momentarily shut down

14:12.559 --> 14:14.647
the Cybertech building security system.

14:14.648 --> 14:16.206
Now this particular facility

14:16.207 --> 14:18.025
houses a number of government contractors.

14:18.026 --> 14:21.508
One of them is Cybertech Transnational.

14:21.559 --> 14:24.055
Someone gained access
to Cybertech's clean room

14:24.056 --> 14:27.138
and stole a highly classified
hardware security module.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.841
This is that module

14:28.842 --> 14:30.511
that contains the encryption system

14:30.512 --> 14:33.372
that serves as the gateway to
the military satellite network.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.073
Whoever took it is capable of shutting

14:35.074 --> 14:37.151
that satellite network down completely.

14:37.152 --> 14:40.759
Leaving a large portion of
our military's defenses blind.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.145
What do we know about our thieves?

14:42.146 --> 14:45.273
Not much. There's no
prints, no trace D.N.A.

14:45.274 --> 14:47.219
But it was a highly complex operation.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.585
So we believe whoever pulled this off

14:48.586 --> 14:50.103
had to have had military training

14:50.104 --> 14:51.255
or stealth ops.

14:51.256 --> 14:53.143
They had to blow up the transformer,

14:53.144 --> 14:55.360
disable the backup generators,

14:55.361 --> 14:57.833
then climb up this air shaft.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.787
And they had to do it
all extremely quickly,

14:59.788 --> 15:02.770
because even though the blackout
defeated the security cameras,

15:02.771 --> 15:05.105
they reset on battery
power five minutes later.

15:05.106 --> 15:07.976
There's no way this operation
took less than five minutes.

15:07.977 --> 15:09.860
We must have video footage of them leaving.

15:09.861 --> 15:11.783
No, sir. We scrubbed the entire video.

15:11.784 --> 15:13.151
There's nothing.

15:13.923 --> 15:15.369
Could they still be in the building?

15:15.370 --> 15:16.832
No, not if they're alive.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.806
A thermal imaging sweep
of the entire premises

15:18.807 --> 15:20.075
came up negative.

15:20.458 --> 15:21.707
They must have found a way out

15:21.708 --> 15:23.360
that didn't take them past the cameras.

15:23.361 --> 15:24.730
There isn't one, sir.

15:24.976 --> 15:27.337
The outside of the
building has 100% coverage.

15:28.276 --> 15:30.205
What about under the building?

15:30.303 --> 15:30.870
Under it?

15:30.871 --> 15:33.637
A research facility dealing
with sensitive materials

15:33.638 --> 15:35.643
would need to have some
sort of flood controls.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.326
Can you pull up a map of
the drainage system myriad?

15:41.351 --> 15:44.241
Drainage tunnels go right under
the building. We thought of that.

15:44.242 --> 15:45.631
We checked all the access points,

15:45.632 --> 15:46.977
including the drainage grids.

15:46.978 --> 15:49.515
- They're all welded shut.
- Check 'em again.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.576
If they did use the tunnels,

15:51.710 --> 15:53.690
they wouldn't have
wanted to travel too far.

15:53.971 --> 15:55.539
So they'd need to access
the drainage system

15:55.540 --> 15:57.983
from a nearby area... one
that's inactive at night.

15:57.984 --> 15:58.847
Like...

16:01.125 --> 16:02.406
this golf course.

16:08.036 --> 16:08.999
Thanks.

16:09.901 --> 16:12.107
That was Hendricks from the building.

16:12.108 --> 16:14.429
Turns out someone did
pry open the drain grate,

16:14.430 --> 16:16.205
then welded it on the way out.

16:16.747 --> 16:17.800
There's hope for you, Beckett.

16:17.801 --> 16:19.265
Well, at least we know
we're on the right track.

16:19.266 --> 16:21.592
Excuse me. Federal agents.

16:21.783 --> 16:23.597
Uh, is this about the
blackout the other night?

16:24.382 --> 16:25.772
Yeah. How did you know that?

16:25.773 --> 16:27.116
Well, like I told the other guy,

16:27.117 --> 16:29.836
I wasn't here, so you'll
have to talk to Watkins.

16:29.837 --> 16:30.933
What other guy?

16:36.582 --> 16:38.041
What the hell is he doing here?

16:47.244 --> 16:48.727
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

16:48.728 --> 16:50.429
Beckett, I know he was
your partner in New York...

16:50.430 --> 16:52.793
No, no, I swear. I didn't
say anything to him.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.219
Then why is he here?

16:57.060 --> 16:58.346
Agent Beckett.

16:58.347 --> 16:59.335
Agent McCord.

16:59.336 --> 17:01.844
- What are you guys doing here?
- What are you doing here?

17:01.845 --> 17:05.046
Well, I figured since, uh,
Beckett was working, I'd...

17:05.401 --> 17:06.888
I'd just get in a few rounds.

17:07.521 --> 17:08.596
Where are your clubs?

17:09.307 --> 17:09.856
Crap.

17:09.857 --> 17:10.553
Do you realize what would happen

17:10.554 --> 17:12.006
if I told the chief that he was here?

17:12.007 --> 17:13.618
You would be kicked off the team,

17:13.619 --> 17:16.343
not to mention obstruction
charges against you.

17:16.554 --> 17:18.009
This is my one and only warning.

17:18.010 --> 17:21.345
The next time I see you, it'd
better be on a book jacket.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.064
Okay, she is not invited to the wedding.

17:29.065 --> 17:31.334
"Get in a few rounds"?

17:31.335 --> 17:33.723
What did you want me to say,
that you accidentally left out

17:33.724 --> 17:35.601
your evidence photo of
the blown transformer?

17:35.787 --> 17:37.573
Castle, you went through
my classified photos?

17:37.574 --> 17:39.911
- What the hell were you doing?
- Trying to help.

17:40.813 --> 17:43.404
- I didn't think I'd get caught.
- Yeah, well, you did.

17:43.405 --> 17:45.410
- Yeah.
- How'd you get here, anyway?

17:45.411 --> 17:46.692
I mean, why are you here?

17:46.693 --> 17:49.005
Well, the transformer
led me to a research park

17:49.006 --> 17:51.421
where all the tenants
have government contracts.

17:51.422 --> 17:53.096
I figured maybe they're using the blackout

17:53.097 --> 17:54.826
to circumvent the security system.

17:54.827 --> 17:56.972
But they're not just gonna
waltz in through the front door.

17:56.973 --> 17:59.048
Then I remembered that case
we had at the old haunt,

17:59.049 --> 18:01.739
- where the killer used...
- Used the abandoned sewer tunnels

18:01.740 --> 18:03.239
underneath New York. Yes.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.511
You thought of it, too.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.227
Except... this isn't New York.

18:07.339 --> 18:09.655
Do you realize how many laws were broken

18:09.656 --> 18:11.152
by looking at that photo?

18:11.296 --> 18:13.045
Are you trying to get me fired?

18:13.046 --> 18:14.379
Would make it easier to see you.

18:14.380 --> 18:15.583
Not if I was in jail.

18:15.994 --> 18:16.717
Right.

18:16.718 --> 18:17.942
Look, I wanna see you, too,

18:17.943 --> 18:19.508
but it can't be like this, okay?

18:19.509 --> 18:21.207
You have to promise
you're gonna stop fiddling

18:21.208 --> 18:22.433
with this investigation.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.833
Okay. Yeah. I promise.

18:23.834 --> 18:26.428
But wouldn't you at least
like to hear what I found out?

18:27.959 --> 18:28.868
Right.

18:29.257 --> 18:31.276
These guys didn't see anything
the night of the blackout.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.635
It was too dark.

18:32.636 --> 18:33.907
But that guard over there

18:33.908 --> 18:35.493
remembers seeing a guy a couple days ago

18:35.494 --> 18:37.861
in a late '90s model gold Sedan.

18:37.862 --> 18:39.647
- He's probably doing some kind of recon.
- Castle...

18:39.648 --> 18:41.382
- If you have them send over
their surveillance footage...
- Castle.

18:41.707 --> 18:43.885
Castle! Please.

18:45.003 --> 18:45.912
Right.

18:46.037 --> 18:49.047
Sorry. Okay. I'm out. I...
I... I didn't... I promise.

18:49.138 --> 18:50.840
Wiped from my brain.

18:50.878 --> 18:52.097
Like I wasn't even here.

18:54.246 --> 18:55.568
- I gotta go.
- Of course.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.261
Nice job with the drainage tunnel.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.039
Keep up the good work, Beckett.

19:25.513 --> 19:26.402
Thank you...

19:27.498 --> 19:30.287
for, uh, not saying anything about Castle.

19:31.858 --> 19:32.815
Look...

19:33.311 --> 19:35.138
when I was a year out of Quantico,

19:35.294 --> 19:38.154
I was busting my ass on this case...

19:38.396 --> 19:39.592
my first big chance,

19:39.593 --> 19:41.718
and we'd been going at
it straight for a month,

19:41.719 --> 19:43.616
and I really wanted to let off some steam,

19:43.617 --> 19:46.417
so I went to a bar, and I picked up a guy,

19:46.418 --> 19:47.636
and I took him home.

19:47.655 --> 19:50.296
Next morning, he says, "who's Scofield?"

19:50.683 --> 19:53.431
Scofield was the subject of our

19:53.481 --> 19:55.981
highly classified investigation.

19:55.982 --> 19:57.329
You talked in your sleep?

19:57.330 --> 20:00.170
It's this job. Things happen.

20:00.392 --> 20:02.711
You better make sure they only happen once.

20:07.412 --> 20:09.293
Golf course security video's in.

20:10.115 --> 20:13.478
This is across the street from
the entrance to the golf course

20:13.479 --> 20:15.128
the day before yesterday.

20:15.323 --> 20:18.088
Our guy said the car stayed
like this for 15 minutes.

20:18.089 --> 20:19.164
Can we get a plate?

20:22.998 --> 20:24.806
Ah, the angle's just not good enough.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.185
What about the driver?

20:27.178 --> 20:28.330
Pretty clear shot.

20:28.406 --> 20:32.869
Creating a future vector descriptor
to run facial recognition.

20:34.357 --> 20:36.262
Check the military databases first.

20:36.263 --> 20:37.531
This guy's had training.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.623
This was two days ago.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.705
That's the day before the break-in.

20:46.706 --> 20:48.672
He's planning his escape route.

20:50.308 --> 20:51.487
We've got a match.

20:52.486 --> 20:54.902
Driver was Jack Bronson, 35.

20:54.903 --> 20:57.306
Recently retired marine force recon.

20:57.335 --> 20:59.944
His last rotation he worked Black Ops,

20:59.945 --> 21:03.530
specializing in forward
position infiltration.

21:03.567 --> 21:04.979
You got an address on this guy?

21:18.075 --> 21:19.014
Clear!

21:20.425 --> 21:21.278
Clear!

21:21.279 --> 21:22.129
Clear.

21:23.135 --> 21:24.221
He's not here.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.112
Except he left this.

21:27.231 --> 21:28.332
Tools of the trade.

21:32.255 --> 21:34.542
C-4 to blow up the transformer.

21:35.017 --> 21:38.553
Wire cutters to disable
the backup generator rope

21:38.554 --> 21:40.344
and pulleys for the air shaft.

21:41.486 --> 21:42.565
This is our guy.

21:42.642 --> 21:43.929
Tear this place apart.

21:45.068 --> 21:47.290
We're not gonna find that
encryption system here.

21:47.575 --> 21:48.855
That's his meal ticket.

21:49.246 --> 21:51.076
Wherever he went, that
thing's going with him.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.408
Hendricks, call the office.
Pull his phone records.

21:53.409 --> 21:55.856
Run his credit cards. I
wanna know who he talks to,

21:55.857 --> 21:58.748
where he eats, what gym he goes to.

21:58.749 --> 22:00.653
And have him look for a girlfriend.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.890
If he's on the run, he might have help.

22:13.307 --> 22:14.691
Hey, Castle, everything okay?

22:14.760 --> 22:16.126
Red or white?

22:16.963 --> 22:17.686
What?

22:17.687 --> 22:19.580
What kind of wine do you
want with your salmon?

22:19.581 --> 22:20.301
I'm cooking you dinner tonight

22:20.302 --> 22:22.142
to make up for getting
you in trouble at work.

22:22.268 --> 22:23.483
That's so sweet.

22:24.084 --> 22:25.676
Yeah, I know. Um...

22:25.677 --> 22:27.525
- So how's the case going?
- Castle.

22:27.526 --> 22:29.814
No, I just wanna know
when to start cooking.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.870
Trust me. I got the
message. Cone of silence.

22:32.871 --> 22:34.820
Church and state. No more interference.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.905
Okay, well, then in that
case, red, and, um...

22:39.196 --> 22:41.267
can you get that kind
that makes me feel all...

22:41.630 --> 22:44.497
I'll buy a whole case. See you tonight.

22:45.595 --> 22:46.912
We're gonna walk over to my car together,

22:46.913 --> 22:48.400
and you're gonna get in like you know me.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.616
Yeah, but I don't know you,

22:49.617 --> 22:51.722
and I have salmon here that
needs to be refrigerated.

22:52.150 --> 22:53.480
Okay. Okay.

22:57.422 --> 23:00.727
Hey, this is a... late '90s gold Sedan.

23:00.728 --> 23:01.845
You're the guy...

23:09.667 --> 23:10.643
Okay, look,

23:10.739 --> 23:12.110
you're making a mistake here, okay?

23:12.111 --> 23:13.708
I don't... I don't...
that's a red. That's a red.

23:13.709 --> 23:15.622
Hey, go! Go! Stop!

23:15.623 --> 23:16.582
Jeez!

23:16.692 --> 23:19.389
Ooh. Ahh. I don't know who you think I am.

23:19.390 --> 23:20.712
I know who you are.

23:20.713 --> 23:22.624
You were at the golf course with the feds.

23:22.757 --> 23:23.812
What do they know?

23:24.110 --> 23:25.545
I... I... I'm not sure.

23:25.546 --> 23:26.997
Are they looking at me?

23:26.998 --> 23:29.460
- Do they know about Valkyrie?
- I don't know! I don't know!

23:29.461 --> 23:31.833
All right? I swear. I... I
wasn't even supposed to be there.

23:31.834 --> 23:36.107
Did they... say anything about Valkyrie?

23:37.102 --> 23:38.335
Hey, man, are you okay?

23:38.564 --> 23:42.123
Mnh-mnh. Can't... hold... on.

23:42.500 --> 23:47.253
- Going... to dream... world.
- Hey.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.483
Hands at 10 and 2.

23:52.484 --> 23:53.440
Come on, buddy.

23:54.147 --> 23:55.213
Heading on the left.

24:13.429 --> 24:14.458
Bronson?

24:14.459 --> 24:15.470
That's him.

24:15.665 --> 24:17.879
- What about the hardware module?
- It's not in the car.

24:17.930 --> 24:19.526
- Anybody riding with him?
- Yep.

24:19.527 --> 24:20.825
- Girlfriend?
- Nope.

24:21.131 --> 24:22.094
That guy.

24:25.077 --> 24:26.425
You've gotta be kidding me.

24:27.131 --> 24:28.342
You know what? I'll... I'll deal with him.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.389
No. You've already had your chance.

24:30.390 --> 24:33.417
Hendricks, please place
Mr. Castle under arrest.

24:42.565 --> 24:43.549
Hello?

24:44.107 --> 24:45.485
Is anyone even there?

24:47.043 --> 24:48.739
Where's Beckett? Let me talk to her.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.124
I'm afraid she can't help you.

24:54.403 --> 24:56.563
Look, this has just
been a misunderstanding.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.220
You were in a car with a man who we believe

24:59.221 --> 25:01.507
is an enemy combatant of the United States.

25:01.980 --> 25:03.974
That's not a misunderstanding, Mr. Castle.

25:03.975 --> 25:05.103
That's a federal offense.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.837
Whoa. I was abducted at gunpoint.

25:08.838 --> 25:11.686
Is that so? And of all
the people in the world,

25:11.687 --> 25:15.219
why would our chief suspect abduct you?

25:15.220 --> 25:18.340
I don't know. He said he
saw me at the golf course

25:18.341 --> 25:19.711
with Beckett and McCord.

25:19.712 --> 25:21.502
Why exactly were you at the golf course?

25:23.131 --> 25:25.018
Why are you in D.C., Mr. Castle?

25:26.843 --> 25:27.933
But why did you choose

25:27.934 --> 25:29.973
to see her on this particular weekend?

25:29.974 --> 25:31.057
Well, I...

25:32.808 --> 25:34.230
Oh, now wait a minute.

25:34.316 --> 25:36.982
What, you don't think I'm
involved in this, do you?

25:40.145 --> 25:41.275
Okay, look...

25:41.718 --> 25:43.671
a man walked up to me on the street,

25:43.672 --> 25:47.038
shoved a gun in my ribs
and forced me into a car.

25:47.039 --> 25:48.645
Then he started questioning me,

25:48.646 --> 25:50.855
whether or not you guys know about him

25:50.856 --> 25:52.551
or about Valkyrie.

25:53.345 --> 25:54.784
- Valkyrie?
- Yeah.

25:59.989 --> 26:01.225
What's Valkyrie?

26:01.455 --> 26:02.806
I don't know!

26:03.115 --> 26:05.146
I told him I didn't know,

26:05.157 --> 26:07.907
and then he dropped dead right in the car.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.229
Mysteriously? With you
sitting right next to him?

26:13.434 --> 26:15.833
No, there's nothing relevant about Valkyrie

26:15.834 --> 26:17.291
in any of our databases.

26:17.292 --> 26:20.074
It could be the name of
Bronson's contact or buyer.

26:20.075 --> 26:21.490
They must have found out we were on to him

26:21.491 --> 26:22.391
and taken him out.

26:22.392 --> 26:24.397
Which means the encryption
system's in play.

26:24.398 --> 26:26.072
Sir, I know what this looks like,

26:26.073 --> 26:29.012
but I swear to you, Castle's
not involved in any of this.

26:29.013 --> 26:30.175
We know he isn't.

26:30.884 --> 26:33.535
We have A.T.M. footage on him
being abducted at gunpoint,

26:33.536 --> 26:34.628
just like you said.

26:34.964 --> 26:35.896
Well, then why did you...

26:35.897 --> 26:38.516
I needed to make sure he
told us everything he knew,

26:40.769 --> 26:42.185
he needed to learn once and for all

26:42.186 --> 26:44.094
to keep his nose out of federal business.

26:44.347 --> 26:46.097
Any word yet on how Bronson died?

26:46.098 --> 26:47.520
They're doing the autopsy right now.

26:47.521 --> 26:49.403
Sir, we've got something.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.599
- Uh, what about Castle?
- Let him sweat.

26:58.453 --> 26:59.458
I'm sorry.

27:00.849 --> 27:03.032
So this is Jeanette
Miller, Bronson's girlfriend

27:03.033 --> 27:04.968
and most likely his accomplice.

27:04.969 --> 27:06.404
Uh, they've been dating for six months.

27:06.405 --> 27:08.350
Phone records show that Bronson called her

27:08.351 --> 27:10.770
a number of times right
before he abducted Mr. Castle,

27:10.771 --> 27:14.339
and get this... she worked
as an aide to Senator Shelton.

27:14.340 --> 27:15.700
Shelton's a ranking member

27:15.701 --> 27:17.479
of the foreign relations committee.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.982
She'd have the connections to help Bronson

27:18.983 --> 27:21.181
move the encryption
system out of the country.

27:21.653 --> 27:23.865
She's part of this. Find
her, you find that system.

27:23.866 --> 27:24.961
You have a location on her?

27:24.962 --> 27:26.487
We tracked the G.P.S. on her phone

27:26.488 --> 27:27.656
to a street in Rosemont,

27:27.657 --> 27:29.092
but when we moved in a few minutes ago,

27:29.093 --> 27:32.011
we found the phone and
her car, both abandoned.

27:32.021 --> 27:32.982
She's off the grid.

27:32.983 --> 27:34.500
She knows we're looking for her.

27:34.501 --> 27:36.292
I want every inch of this
city under surveillance.

27:36.293 --> 27:37.553
You tap into every sidewalk,

27:37.554 --> 27:39.376
traffic and mass transit video feed.

27:39.377 --> 27:42.365
Run everything through facial
recognition with a 70% match.

27:42.426 --> 27:44.115
She may have altered her appearance.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.292
I want her found.

27:45.293 --> 27:46.349
You got it, sir.

27:47.408 --> 27:48.539
Not you, Beckett.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.532
You and I have something else to discuss.

27:57.638 --> 27:59.913
Please tell me there's something
stronger than coffee in there.

28:00.218 --> 28:01.233
Sorry.

28:04.484 --> 28:07.393
So... how much trouble am I in?

28:07.859 --> 28:10.204
Not as much as me.

28:13.176 --> 28:14.840
Look, Castle...

28:15.059 --> 28:17.852
I can't make it like it was before, can I?

28:19.649 --> 28:20.944
Maybe it'll be better.

28:22.358 --> 28:24.505
This way, when we come
home at the end of each day,

28:24.506 --> 28:25.933
we'll have something to talk about,

28:25.934 --> 28:27.380
like normal couples.

28:27.611 --> 28:29.402
Only your day will be classified.

28:30.853 --> 28:32.088
We're gonna make this work.

28:32.089 --> 28:33.433
I promise.

28:33.443 --> 28:35.967
I'll have a couple of
days off after this case,

28:35.968 --> 28:38.998
and... and we'll figure
it out, but until then...

28:38.999 --> 28:40.483
You don't have to say it.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.852
I'll be on the first
flight out in the morning.

29:01.796 --> 29:02.635
Mr. C.!

29:04.651 --> 29:05.660
Pi.

29:08.802 --> 29:09.705
Where's Alexis?

29:09.706 --> 29:11.216
She went shopping with her grandma.

29:11.233 --> 29:12.394
I volunteered to make dinner tonight,

29:12.395 --> 29:14.218
and I'm just getting a jump on the prep.

29:14.465 --> 29:16.852
Can I count you in on a nice, juicy steak?

29:18.508 --> 29:19.684
These aren't steaks.

29:19.685 --> 29:20.883
That's papaya steak.

29:20.919 --> 29:22.441
It's the juiciest steak there is.

29:23.410 --> 29:25.493
This is all fruit.

29:25.648 --> 29:26.797
I'm a fruitarian.

29:27.713 --> 29:28.765
Course you are.

29:28.982 --> 29:30.236
It's all that I eat.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.184
Original diet of mankind.

29:32.474 --> 29:34.534
Nutrition as God intended.

29:35.799 --> 29:40.055
You know, Pi, don't, uh, take
this the wrong way, but...

29:40.188 --> 29:43.857
how long do you plan on
staying at casa de Castle?

29:44.701 --> 29:47.492
You know, I'm actually
in a little bit of a bind.

29:47.573 --> 29:49.920
See, I live in Amsterdam,

29:49.920 --> 29:53.620
but I, uh... kinda lost my passport.

29:54.182 --> 29:55.723
But, hey, you don't wanna
hear about my troubles.

29:55.723 --> 29:57.075
You got your own, right?

29:57.075 --> 29:58.415
I do now.

29:58.595 --> 30:00.337
You are gonna clean all this up?

30:01.777 --> 30:03.101
Mr. C.,

30:03.515 --> 30:05.083
I get the feeling things didn't go too well

30:05.084 --> 30:07.214
in D.C with your fiancée, did they?

30:09.421 --> 30:12.030
No, Pi. They did not.

30:12.958 --> 30:14.759
You know, sometimes the best thing to do...

30:14.909 --> 30:16.274
is talk about it.

30:21.726 --> 30:23.764
You know what? You're absolutely right.

30:26.864 --> 30:27.917
Where you goin'?

30:27.917 --> 30:29.901
I'm going to find someone
to talk about it with.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.453
Any luck tracking down
Bronson's girlfriend?

30:48.642 --> 30:49.931
Not yet.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.646
Castle get home okay?

30:58.268 --> 30:59.222
Yeah.

30:59.222 --> 31:00.628
Fine.

31:00.906 --> 31:02.493
You wanna talk about it?

31:02.806 --> 31:04.090
No.

31:04.213 --> 31:05.455
Good.

31:10.249 --> 31:11.162
You get a hit?

31:11.162 --> 31:12.711
Possible match. Uh...

31:12.711 --> 31:15.224
- 87% certainty?
- Bring it up.

31:16.224 --> 31:19.525
This is traffic cam video, streaming live.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.668
Well, she dyed her hair, but that's her.

31:21.668 --> 31:23.543
And that bag on her shoulder...

31:23.543 --> 31:26.519
- You think she's got the encryption system in it?
- Let's go find out.

31:26.519 --> 31:28.159
Wait. We're losing her.

31:28.159 --> 31:29.671
Switching feeds.

31:29.851 --> 31:30.884
There.

31:30.884 --> 31:32.092
Where is this?

31:32.092 --> 31:34.836
20th and P, near Dupont Circle.

31:35.142 --> 31:38.349
This is McCord. We need to acquire
a target near Dupont Circle.

31:38.349 --> 31:39.889
We're losing her again.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.410
- She's gone.
- Richmond.

31:48.410 --> 31:50.826
She must have ducked into a store or alley.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.964
Or the Metro. Damn it. Stand by.

31:52.964 --> 31:54.757
Can you just display the
route that she was following?

31:54.757 --> 31:58.212
Okay. It's analyzing her path.

32:02.422 --> 32:05.365
It doesn't look like she's
taking a direct route.

32:05.365 --> 32:07.893
It's like she's using evasive tactics.

32:07.893 --> 32:10.620
Okay, so if she started off in Rosemont...

32:11.082 --> 32:13.631
her general trajectory leads to...

32:14.997 --> 32:15.809
Union Station.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.647
She's making a run for it.

32:19.677 --> 32:21.885
You know, I don't think
Jenny and I have been apart

32:21.885 --> 32:23.882
for more than two days since we met.

32:23.882 --> 32:24.924
It's gotta be rough.

32:24.924 --> 32:26.159
I just feel like we're so far out of synch.

32:26.159 --> 32:27.907
I don't know how to get back.

32:28.434 --> 32:32.141
Guess I was just... trying
to make it feel like us again.

32:32.141 --> 32:34.976
Yeah, by playing me and Ryan for chumps.

32:35.612 --> 32:36.803
You should have known that we were gonna

32:36.803 --> 32:38.265
figure out this case was real.

32:38.265 --> 32:40.996
Well, you'll be happy
to know that for my sins,

32:41.014 --> 32:44.702
I was abducted by a maniac
at gunpoint and nearly killed,

32:44.702 --> 32:46.579
but at least I didn't get Beckett fired.

32:46.579 --> 32:48.711
Whoa, whoa. Abducted?

32:49.620 --> 32:50.828
By who?

32:52.379 --> 32:54.599
Look, guys, I really shouldn't
be talking about this.

32:58.026 --> 32:59.543
Come on, Castle. It's us.

32:59.543 --> 33:00.827
And thanks to you,

33:00.827 --> 33:02.503
we're already involved.

33:02.737 --> 33:04.729
Okay, but this goes no further, all right?

33:04.729 --> 33:06.149
So I'm just walking down the street,

33:06.149 --> 33:07.611
and this guy that they're looking for

33:07.611 --> 33:09.841
grabs me, shoves me into a car,

33:09.841 --> 33:12.610
starts talking crazy,
asking all these questions.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.308
- What kind of questions?
- Something about Valkyrie,

33:16.308 --> 33:18.045
and then I thought he was gonna pass out

33:18.045 --> 33:19.887
because he was talking about
going off to dream world.

33:19.887 --> 33:21.332
But he didn't pass out.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.791
He dropped dead.

33:23.219 --> 33:25.987
Uh, this guy... was he, uh...

33:25.987 --> 33:27.449
was he military?

33:28.139 --> 33:30.148
Why, is "Valkyrie" a military term?

33:30.148 --> 33:31.252
I don't know about "Valkyrie,"

33:31.252 --> 33:32.604
but "Dream world"...

33:32.604 --> 33:35.405
It's a highly classified special
operations base in the Gulf.

33:35.405 --> 33:37.263
It's a ghost base.

33:37.263 --> 33:38.843
The government's never
confirmed its existence,

33:38.843 --> 33:40.429
but I...

33:40.429 --> 33:43.446
I met a guy who knew a guy
who was stationed there.

33:44.120 --> 33:44.958
Where is it?

33:44.958 --> 33:47.821
I... it... it's a ghost base, Castle.

33:47.821 --> 33:49.776
You think he's gonna say where it is?

33:51.327 --> 33:53.669
No. But I will tell you this.

33:54.067 --> 33:55.931
If Beckett's case has
anything to do with this base,

33:55.931 --> 33:58.781
well, then she's into something
way bigger than she realizes.

34:12.911 --> 34:14.297
There.

34:15.504 --> 34:17.674
Target is moving to
the mezzanine. Close in.

34:17.674 --> 34:19.257
- No, wait. Not yet.
- Stand by.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.578
Would you like her to catch a train?

34:20.578 --> 34:22.618
No, something else is going on.

34:22.618 --> 34:24.726
She abandoned her car in Rosemont,

34:24.726 --> 34:25.920
and then she came all the way out here?

34:25.920 --> 34:27.841
Maybe she thought she was being followed.

34:27.841 --> 34:29.786
Then why didn't she just
hop the train in Alexandria?

34:29.786 --> 34:32.317
Maybe the line she wants
only leaves from here.

34:33.179 --> 34:35.733
Or maybe she's meeting her buyer here.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.646
You're the one that told
me to follow my instincts,

34:38.646 --> 34:40.683
and my instincts say that we should wait.

34:43.014 --> 34:45.723
Union Station is a nonsmoking building...

34:45.728 --> 34:47.983
I'll give your instincts two minutes.

34:48.012 --> 34:49.399
Hold position.

34:58.599 --> 35:01.048
Where is she? Where did she go?

35:04.213 --> 35:06.392
I knew it. I knew we
shouldn't have done this.

35:06.916 --> 35:08.378
No, by the lockers.

35:11.937 --> 35:14.880
Jeanette Miller. Federal
agents. You're under arrest.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.201
- What?
- Let's do this quietly.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.181
- Step away.
- What? What did I do?

35:32.407 --> 35:33.735
Look, I told you,

35:33.735 --> 35:35.497
I have never seen this before in my life.

35:35.497 --> 35:37.033
Then what was it doing in that locker?

35:37.033 --> 35:38.944
Trafficking government property,

35:38.944 --> 35:41.655
jeopardizing national security, treason...

35:41.655 --> 35:44.735
each one is punishable
by life imprisonment.

35:44.735 --> 35:47.081
Or worse. What was the plan, anyway?

35:47.081 --> 35:49.158
Did someone hire you and
Jack Bronson to steal it?

35:49.158 --> 35:52.264
You don't understand.
This isn't how it looks.

35:52.264 --> 35:54.383
Really? Because you dumped your phone,

35:54.383 --> 35:56.856
and then you dumped your
car and you dyed your hair.

35:56.856 --> 35:57.973
Clearly you're trying to disappear.

35:57.973 --> 36:01.700
Because Jack was in trouble.
He's being set up. We both are.

36:01.700 --> 36:02.734
- Jeanette...
- Listen.

36:02.734 --> 36:04.751
He got a call a couple of nights ago...

36:04.751 --> 36:07.071
someone wanting to meet
him at a golf course.

36:07.071 --> 36:09.427
And whatever they said freaked Jack out,

36:09.427 --> 36:11.756
so he went out there,
but the guy never showed.

36:11.756 --> 36:13.253
And then when he heard about the break-in,

36:13.253 --> 36:15.165
he realized they'd set him up.

36:15.165 --> 36:16.915
- Who?
- He didn't know.

36:17.212 --> 36:19.987
But Jack was scared, and
Jack does not get scared.

36:19.987 --> 36:21.611
And he said that we needed to go on the run

36:21.611 --> 36:23.862
until he could figure
out what was going on.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.602
And he told me to go to
his locker at union station,

36:26.602 --> 36:28.338
that there'd be money there...

36:29.275 --> 36:31.272
and he'd meet up with me when he could.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.296
Okay, if he wasn't involved,

36:32.296 --> 36:34.260
then how did that end up in his locker?

36:34.260 --> 36:36.334
I don't know. Maybe it's part of the setup.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.457
What's Valkyrie?

36:40.949 --> 36:43.186
- Valkyrie?
- What did Jack tell you about Valkyrie?

36:45.867 --> 36:48.453
Look, where is Jack?
Do you know where he is?

36:55.344 --> 36:56.895
Oh, no.

37:00.203 --> 37:01.720
She had the encryption system.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.668
She had the overseas contacts,

37:03.668 --> 37:05.821
and yet after everything she did,

37:05.821 --> 37:08.322
she really expects us to
believe she wasn't involved?

37:08.322 --> 37:10.956
Well, people do crazy
things when they're in love.

37:11.401 --> 37:12.686
I noticed.

37:13.744 --> 37:15.657
Don't tell me you believe her.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.887
Well, she's right.
Bronson was being set up.

37:18.887 --> 37:21.412
- And why do you think that?
- The tools in his apartment,

37:21.412 --> 37:23.371
the security footage from the golf course,

37:23.371 --> 37:25.812
even the encryption system in his locker...

37:25.812 --> 37:28.740
someone with his training
wouldn't be that sloppy.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.911
You know what the hardest
thing about this job is?

37:30.911 --> 37:33.414
- What?
- Knowing when to stop doing this job.

37:33.548 --> 37:35.277
We have the encryption system.

37:35.277 --> 37:37.803
We got the bad guy. This is a victory.

37:37.803 --> 37:39.253
I wasn't wrong in the train station,

37:39.253 --> 37:40.105
and I'm not wrong here.

37:40.105 --> 37:41.846
There is something that we're missing.

37:42.887 --> 37:44.130
Okay.

37:44.603 --> 37:47.996
Let's just say someone did
have it out for Bronson.

37:47.996 --> 37:49.980
Why would they go through all the effort

37:49.980 --> 37:52.075
to orchestrate a blackout,

37:52.075 --> 37:54.206
break into a secure government facility,

37:54.206 --> 37:56.752
only to steal something
that they knew we'd recover?

37:56.934 --> 37:59.853
There are many easier
ways to set someone up.

37:59.853 --> 38:01.460
Wait. I mean, you're right.

38:01.481 --> 38:03.919
Why would someone go
through all the trouble

38:03.919 --> 38:06.906
to steal something just so
that we would recover it?

38:07.080 --> 38:09.202
Unless it was a diversion.

38:09.570 --> 38:11.899
What if it wasn't the encryption system

38:11.899 --> 38:13.637
that they were really after?

38:14.919 --> 38:18.551
They just wanted us to think
that that's what they were after.

38:18.551 --> 38:20.914
And the air shaft that they
used to access Cybertech...

38:20.914 --> 38:23.453
they could have used that
to access any of the floors

38:23.453 --> 38:24.567
in that same building.

38:24.567 --> 38:27.250
Cybertech is on floors 3 and 4.

38:27.250 --> 38:28.683
Right, and...

38:30.828 --> 38:33.053
5 and 6 are a genetics lab.

38:33.202 --> 38:37.059
7... is a consulting firm.

38:37.391 --> 38:38.976
And 8...

38:42.989 --> 38:45.273
There are no details about the tenant on 8.

38:45.273 --> 38:47.370
It says it's classified.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.645
What's on 8?

39:02.420 --> 39:03.810
Are you coming, dad?

39:03.834 --> 39:04.967
Dinner's ready.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.294
Oh, yes. I'd best hurry.

39:06.294 --> 39:08.572
I wouldn't want my
papaya steak to get cold.

39:08.572 --> 39:10.599
Have you even tried
them? They're delicious.

39:10.599 --> 39:11.324
Maybe you should start without me.

39:11.324 --> 39:13.318
I'm right in the middle of something.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.487
You're not avoiding Pi, are you?

39:15.487 --> 39:19.660
No, sweetheart. I'm just doing
some research for a story.

39:19.793 --> 39:22.304
You sure you're not still
looking into Beckett's case?

39:22.434 --> 39:24.710
Even after you promised not to?

39:24.836 --> 39:26.206
I'll get it.

39:27.502 --> 39:29.412
Look, it's fine.

39:29.412 --> 39:31.295
No one's ever gonna know.

39:32.006 --> 39:34.192
Richard, these men are here for you.

39:34.192 --> 39:36.046
They say they're federal agents.

39:36.046 --> 39:39.370
- Castle, you need to come with us right away.
- What is this about?

39:39.370 --> 39:41.094
- Please, sir, just come with us.
- Why?

39:41.094 --> 39:43.738
We... well, wait a minute.
You can't just take him away.

39:43.738 --> 39:46.222
- Do me a favor. Um, call up my lawyer.
- Okay.

39:46.222 --> 39:48.317
- Dad?
- And... and call Beckett.

39:48.317 --> 39:49.500
Okay.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.214
Oh, my God.

40:01.228 --> 40:03.072
Beckett. Finally.

40:03.186 --> 40:04.926
What's going on? Why
won't anyone talk to me?

40:04.926 --> 40:07.614
And why would they take my blood?

40:08.167 --> 40:10.983
Castle, you know that case
that I've been investigating?

40:10.983 --> 40:14.262
The, um, the break-in and the theft?

40:16.206 --> 40:19.052
Well, it turns out there's
more to it than we thought.

40:21.068 --> 40:22.166
Are you gonna waterboard me?

40:22.166 --> 40:24.009
Because that would seriously
affect our relationship.

40:24.009 --> 40:26.516
No, babe, can... can
you listen for a second?

40:30.238 --> 40:33.338
It turns out that something
else was stolen from another lab

40:33.338 --> 40:34.886
in that building.

40:35.417 --> 40:37.818
It was a chemical agent
that they were working on

40:37.818 --> 40:41.199
for the military, but it was
deemed to dangerous to use.

40:42.278 --> 40:47.151
The amount stolen was enough
to kill thousands of people.

40:49.011 --> 40:51.508
Isn't this "need-to-know" stuff?

40:51.508 --> 40:52.464
Why are you telling me?

40:52.464 --> 40:57.643
Because that toxin was
used to kill Jack Bronson,

40:57.643 --> 40:59.605
the man that abducted you.

41:00.441 --> 41:01.398
It was aerosolized.

41:01.398 --> 41:04.452
It was placed in the
ventilation system of his car.

41:07.445 --> 41:08.862
I was in that car.

41:16.132 --> 41:17.471
Was I...

41:21.961 --> 41:23.211
How bad?

41:26.414 --> 41:28.276
Based on the amount
found in your bloodstream,

41:28.276 --> 41:30.071
you have less than a day to live.
