WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:08.774
You nervous?
I got you surrounded.

00:08.776 --> 00:13.045
If I roll a nine
or a six, it's over.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.581
Do you need some tissue
in case you start crying

00:15.583 --> 00:17.683
when you lose?!

00:18.618 --> 00:21.120
You gonna bark all day,
little doggy?

00:21.122 --> 00:22.988
Or are you gonna bite?

00:22.990 --> 00:24.156
( Rattling )

00:24.158 --> 00:25.290
When I first moved
to Hollywood,

00:25.292 --> 00:27.292
my little brother Parker
was six

00:27.294 --> 00:30.129
and still wore footsie
choo-choo train pajamas.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.630
( Chuckles )

00:31.632 --> 00:33.665
He's grown up a lot since then.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.903
Yes! A five!

00:39.039 --> 00:40.139
Monkey bubble time!

00:40.141 --> 00:42.274
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, oooh!

00:42.276 --> 00:43.542
( Mimics explosion )

00:44.544 --> 00:46.745
My sister Maddie...
Not so much.

00:47.781 --> 00:48.914
We're playing a board game

00:48.916 --> 00:50.149
we invented while
you were in Hollywood.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.317
It's a mash-up between
"I rule the world"

00:52.319 --> 00:55.888
We call it
"I smack your world."

00:57.123 --> 00:58.290
Both:
Two, four, six...

00:58.292 --> 00:59.792
( both holler )

00:59.794 --> 01:00.993
Smack it!

01:03.596 --> 01:05.764
I mean, the two of them
have had four years together

01:05.766 --> 01:08.734
to make up games, build forts,

01:08.736 --> 01:10.903
and play in dirt.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.838
But now it is time for me
to do all those things
with Parker.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.742
You know, minus the games,
forts and dirt part.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.210
You wanna play?

01:18.212 --> 01:20.979
Sure, yeah.
Um, do I require a helmet?

01:22.315 --> 01:24.316
A helmet?
Come on, Hollywood.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.984
Join us in the real world,

01:25.986 --> 01:28.053
where we like
a little smack in the head.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.857
Yeah, this game actually
gets really intense.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.358
Mom banned us from
playing in the living room

01:33.360 --> 01:35.194
because one time
Parker rolled a 10,

01:35.196 --> 01:36.695
and on his ninth cartwheel,

01:36.697 --> 01:38.764
knocked over great gram's urn.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.267
But her memory
still lives on...

01:42.269 --> 01:44.336
In the dirt vac.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.372
Huh. So I missed out

01:47.374 --> 01:49.308
on getting to know Parker

01:49.310 --> 01:51.310
and I think I might
have missed a funeral.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.011
( Giggles )

01:53.013 --> 01:55.080
I thought great gram
was still with us.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.916
Oops.

All right, Karen,
tonight's the last night

02:52.840 --> 02:55.707
the pastrami palace
is open. You read...

02:57.844 --> 02:58.911
what's wrong?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.214
( Nasally ) Hi, honey.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.084
I'm trying to loosen
my phlegm so we can go,

03:06.086 --> 03:07.986
but I am so sick.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.156
( Normal voice )
Oh, I was sick...
sick of that pastrami palace.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.424
We've been there four times

03:12.426 --> 03:14.293
since he found out
it was closing.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.261
So I faked a little flu
to get out of going.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.130
See, a big part
of a healthy marriage

03:18.132 --> 03:19.331
is strategic lying.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.235
( Nasally )
I'd suck it up,
but I'd hate to ruin

03:23.237 --> 03:24.770
your night of pastrami.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.739
( Normal voice )
And I'd hate to ruin my night

03:27.741 --> 03:30.075

03:30.077 --> 03:31.410

But I love you, Mr. bates.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.448
Hey, Liv.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.950
Wanna come with me
and eat your weight

03:37.952 --> 03:39.384
in pastrami?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.153
Oh, ha ha.
I would love to,

03:41.155 --> 03:43.455
but I just had pastrami
like three years ago.

03:43.457 --> 03:47.392
All right, I guess
I'll just have to eat
enough for everybody.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.095
Um, use the downstairs bathroom

03:50.097 --> 03:51.163

03:56.337 --> 03:58.337
What are you doing
sitting around?

03:58.339 --> 04:01.139

04:23.264 --> 04:24.830
Oh, dad!

04:24.832 --> 04:27.332
Listen, Joey,
when I was your age,

04:27.334 --> 04:29.835
there was no way you would
have caught me at home

04:29.837 --> 04:31.336
on a Friday night.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.872
I'd have been out having fun.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.808
I'm fun.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.278
Sure you are, dad.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.146
And I'm super athletic

04:41.148 --> 04:43.382
and super smooth
with the ladies.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.919
Listen, I'm headed out
to my old high school
hangout...

04:47.921 --> 04:49.388
the pastrami palace.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.923
Why don't you come with me,

04:51.925 --> 04:55.460
and I'll show you
some real fun?

04:55.462 --> 04:59.965
Dad, there is absolutely
nothing that could happen

04:59.967 --> 05:01.600
to make me want to do that.

05:03.836 --> 05:04.903
Hi, Joey.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.872
( Screams, clears throat )

05:06.874 --> 05:08.507
I'm here to study with Maddie,

05:08.509 --> 05:11.376
but I wore new body spray
in case I saw you.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.512
Take a whiff!

05:13.514 --> 05:16.181
It's okay, willow,
I can smell it from here.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.016
I'm just...
gotta bolt, though.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.153
I have a date
with my dad and fun.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.321
( Laughs )

05:22.323 --> 05:23.522
So much fun.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.492
I think I'm too shy.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.532
Sorry about that cold, mom.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.101
You know, you need
some chicken soup

05:36.103 --> 05:38.270
and, uh, acting lessons.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.406
Dad might believe
you're really sick,

05:41.408 --> 05:43.909
but, one actress to another,
you are no actress.

05:44.265 --> 05:45.244
I'm so relieved.

05:45.245 --> 05:48.547
I didn't wanna have to pretend
to be sick all night.

05:51.050 --> 05:55.387
Your dad's out, Parker's
leaving for a sleepover
with his karate buddies.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.022
That means I've got
a date with...

05:57.024 --> 05:58.490
( English accent )
"Downton abbey."

05:59.425 --> 06:00.492
( Normal voice )
Do not interrupt

06:00.494 --> 06:02.294
unless there's a fire.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.262
Parker: <i>Mom!</i>

06:04.497 --> 06:05.965
Ready for the sleepover?

06:05.966 --> 06:09.935
( Nasally )
Yup, I got you all
packed up and ready to go.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.637
Uh, go where?
The sleepover's here.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.339
Oh, no no no, Parker.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.540
I've got it marked
on the calendar.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.541
Your sleepover is...

06:16.543 --> 06:18.877
At our house.

coming any minute.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.383
This party has to be epic.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.486
I need playground <i>buzz</i>
<i>at school.</i>

06:27.488 --> 06:30.589
Look, I need kids to be
talking about this at recess

06:30.591 --> 06:33.925
so I get invited
to other parties.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.194
Parker...

06:36.196 --> 06:37.929
I'm gonna chaperone your party!

06:37.931 --> 06:39.631
- You are?
- You are?

06:39.633 --> 06:43.468
Yeah. I mean, mom is
way too sick to do it.

06:45.339 --> 06:46.405
I am so sick.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.507
- Thanks, Liv.
- Yeah.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.042
Oh! Wait, mom.
Don't forget this.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.045
And remember, do not use
these tissues too quickly,

06:54.047 --> 06:55.147

a brain freeze.

Hi, I'm Evan!

07:33.220 --> 07:36.221
My mom wants proof
that I was well-behaved.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.689
Can you initial
the box that says

07:37.691 --> 07:39.958
"greeted the host
of party politely"?

07:40.565 --> 07:41.727
Evan.

07:41.728 --> 07:45.430
You just said hi.
It's not like you
brought me flowers.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.367
I'm messing with you.
Ha ha ha.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.470
Of course I'll sign.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.271
Is this your first time
at a sleepover?

07:53.273 --> 07:56.408
'Cause I am sure
you will do great.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.710
Me too! I have tons
of self-confidence

07:58.712 --> 08:01.480
because that's
an important part of character.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.383
Well, you certainly are
a character.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.753
Mind putting that in
the additional comment section?

08:10.590 --> 08:12.023
Oh, and this is
my mom's phone number.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.259
In case there's
any kind of emergency.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.361
I really don't think
that's gonna happen.

08:16.363 --> 08:19.030
Really? I was kinda hoping
things would get nuts

08:19.032 --> 08:20.765
and I'd end up
in a cast or something.

Evan, you don't get out
much, do you?

of one-on-one before we start?

Maddie, we got to get
this history assignment done.

representation of the era."

09:46.485 --> 09:47.485
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:47.487 --> 09:48.820
Oh yeah.

09:48.822 --> 09:49.821
We build a giant...

09:49.823 --> 09:51.489
- guillotine.
- Baguette.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.226
Guillotine's better.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.428
We'll use it to
slice our baguette.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.496
- Yes.
- ( Grunts )

09:59.699 --> 10:01.166
So, uh...

10:01.168 --> 10:02.534
Quick game of one-on-one
before we start?

10:02.536 --> 10:04.135
- Madison!
- Fine.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.407
( Clicking )

10:10.643 --> 10:12.611
Oh come on!

10:12.613 --> 10:15.213
We're hanging and having fun.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.483
Life doesn't happen
on a video screen.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.118
<i>( Siren blares )</i>

10:20.120 --> 10:21.353
Oh man!

10:23.522 --> 10:25.357
Any chance I can get
my phone back?

10:25.359 --> 10:26.558
I would like to post
a picture of you

10:26.560 --> 10:28.693
getting a ticket for
texting while driving.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.228
( Sighs )

10:30.230 --> 10:32.197
Say "pastrami."

10:32.199 --> 10:33.698
( Camera clicks )

10:35.868 --> 10:37.636
( Boys shouting )

10:48.447 --> 10:49.648
Cease fire!

10:50.816 --> 10:52.350
Cease fire.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.586
- Everyone having fun?
- All: Yeah.

10:54.588 --> 10:57.422
We're definitely gonna be
talking about this on Monday.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.791
Remember your favorite
anecdotes.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.960
Are you kidding?
This party rocks.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.595
I never get to do this.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.463
Use fun blasters inside?

11:05.465 --> 11:08.366
No, stay up past 7:30!

11:08.368 --> 11:11.269
Oh mom, you made snacks for us?

11:11.271 --> 11:13.371
Oh.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.874
For you.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.542
I thought you were too sick.

11:17.544 --> 11:20.245
( Sneezes )

11:20.247 --> 11:22.380
Oh no.
It's all contaminated.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.550
I'll have to throw this out
in the garbage can in my room.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.354
Liv, where are you?

11:29.356 --> 11:32.357
My sister says she has
a surprise for us.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.893
No spoilers from me,
but let's just say

11:34.895 --> 11:37.896
she's friends with the rock.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.765
His movies are not
age-appropriate for me.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.536
Okay, I have got something

11:44.538 --> 11:46.838
totally... ¶ coolsies
for you guys. ¶

11:46.840 --> 11:49.240
everyone get in a circle and
sit criss cross applesauce.

11:50.843 --> 11:54.913
Tell me she did not just say,
"criss cross applesauce."

11:56.716 --> 11:57.782
You're all going to love this

11:57.784 --> 11:59.451
and I know that
because dinosaurs

11:59.453 --> 12:00.952
have always been
Parker's favorite.

12:01.921 --> 12:04.789
( Caws )

12:04.791 --> 12:05.924
She's choking!

12:05.926 --> 12:07.425
My mom prepared me for this.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.493
I'll give her the heimlich.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.494
Oh.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.363
Evan, honey, I'm not choking.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.432
That is just my
pterodactyl impression.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.769
It would have been better
if she was choking.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.440
Who is ready for some
duck, duck...

12:22.442 --> 12:24.542
¶ Dinosaur!

12:26.912 --> 12:28.780
Duck.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.782
Duck.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.617
Duck.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.388
Dinosaur!
Whoo!

12:37.390 --> 12:39.390
( Laughing ) Yes!

12:39.392 --> 12:40.859
Whoo.
Come on.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.393
Get up and chase me.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.595
( Chuckles )

12:43.597 --> 12:45.263
Catch me!

12:45.265 --> 12:46.798
Whoo!

12:46.800 --> 12:48.433
Dude,

12:48.435 --> 12:50.635
even my mom would
think this was lame.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.371
Come on, guys.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.293
Let's go eat something
without washing our hands.

12:58.377 --> 12:59.477
Where are you going?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.446
- Duck, duck, dinosaur?
- Yeah.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.581
Liv, what were you thinking?

13:03.583 --> 13:04.749
I thought you loved this game.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.551
When I was six!

13:08.420 --> 13:10.722
Way to embarrass me in front
of my karate buddies.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.791
You're killing
my playground buzz.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.026
Parker...

13:17.530 --> 13:19.497
( Horn honks )

13:19.499 --> 13:21.533
Beat it, Terry.
It's not happening.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.902
( Horn honks, whines )

13:28.073 --> 13:29.407
( Both laugh )

13:29.409 --> 13:31.376
We rocked this guillotine!

13:31.378 --> 13:33.745
Who knew carpentry camp
would pay off, right?

13:34.880 --> 13:38.349
You ready to get your slice on?

13:38.351 --> 13:39.851
Bring out the prisoner!

13:39.853 --> 13:41.386
( French accent ) Baguette,

13:41.388 --> 13:43.521
for crimes against the state,

13:43.523 --> 13:45.056
having too many carbs,

13:45.058 --> 13:47.725
and fraternizing
with the American cheese,

13:47.727 --> 13:48.927
I condemn you!

13:57.102 --> 13:58.503
- Oh!
- ( Laughs )

13:58.505 --> 14:01.039
Maddie, I need your help...

14:02.174 --> 14:03.541
So how's the sleepover going?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.676
Are you and Parker buds yet?

14:04.678 --> 14:07.612
I tried playing
duck, duck, dinosaur,

14:07.614 --> 14:10.481
and it was a disaster
of Jurassic proportions.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.418
Yeah Liv, he kind of
grew out of dinosaurs
in the first grade.

14:14.620 --> 14:15.787
That's interesting.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.522
What was Joey like
in the first grade?

14:19.391 --> 14:20.692
Smaller head, same glasses.

14:20.698 --> 14:22.962
So then I made
fish sticks for them,

14:22.963 --> 14:26.064
you know, the really cool ones
that are shaped like racecars?

14:26.066 --> 14:28.132
I even made ketchup headlights.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.435
He used to love ketchup art.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.903
Uh, Liv, those have been
sitting in the freezer

14:31.905 --> 14:33.471
since he was in third grade.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.874
Well, now they're
sitting in my stomach.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.944
and then I ate the rest
because they are so good.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.746
Maddie, cool if
I guillotine
your math book?

14:41.748 --> 14:44.382
Yeah, sure willow, whatever.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.084
Liv, why are you doing
all these little kid things?

14:46.086 --> 14:47.485
This is a 10-year-old
sleepover.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.620
Well because
those are the things

14:48.622 --> 14:49.821
that Parker and I
liked to do together

14:49.823 --> 14:51.389
before I left for Hollywood.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.724
That was a really
long time ago.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.059
You just need to find
things he likes doing now.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.429
Okay, well then what do
10-year-old boys like to do?

14:58.431 --> 14:59.898
Uh, they like to smash things.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.633
They're incredibly immature.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.101
Yeah!

15:04.803 --> 15:07.405
What's the cosine of that,
trigonometry?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.574
( Laughs )

15:10.409 --> 15:11.709
Just like some
16-year-old girls.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.614
Let me do the talking.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.949
Ooh, here's a tip,

15:17.951 --> 15:20.585
if he's carrying a boom box,
he's not a real cop.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.688
I learned that the hard way.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.093
Sir, it's illegal
to text and drive.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.628
I wasn't texting.

15:30.630 --> 15:34.198
My son was texting,
officer clarkson.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.034
Mike clarkson?

15:36.036 --> 15:39.737
Pete Rooney, is that you?

15:39.739 --> 15:42.540
What is happening?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.742
Mike and I were
buddies in high school.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.679
When he wasn't off winning
state championships
in basketball.

15:47.681 --> 15:51.082
Your dad...
one of the coolest
guys in high school.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.584
How many guys were
in this high school?

15:55.220 --> 15:57.088
I'm not gonna
write you up, Pete.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.557
I believe you weren't
texting and driving,

15:59.559 --> 16:01.292
'cause you never could do
two things at once, right?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.894
( Both laugh )

16:02.896 --> 16:04.562
Thanks, pal.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.631
Hey, you know what?
We're headed out to
the pastrami palace.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.766
The palace?
No way!

16:08.768 --> 16:10.768
Hey, let me clock out
for dinner early.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.236
I'll drive you
over there myself.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.539
How would you like to ride
in a real cop car there,

16:14.541 --> 16:17.875
Little buddy?
I will have you know

16:17.877 --> 16:20.979
I have three chest hairs, sir.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.949
Did you ever get dragged to
a party you didn't want to go to

16:24.951 --> 16:27.085
then ended up having
a great time?

16:27.087 --> 16:29.487
This was not
one of those situations.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.224
Come on, Joey.
Lighten up.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.093
This is fun.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.894
Attention, car 591,

16:36.896 --> 16:38.229
I'd like to report
a teenage boy

16:38.231 --> 16:40.565
having the night
of his life, over.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.834
I wish this was over.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.770
Woman on radio:
<i>Car 591, dispatch.</i>

16:45.772 --> 16:47.238
<i>We have a 1099 in progress.</i>

16:47.240 --> 16:49.574
<i>Red sedan headed west</i>
<i>on route 20.</i>

16:49.576 --> 16:50.908
Whoa. 1099.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.111
That means a stolen car.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.245
How do you know that?

16:54.247 --> 16:57.281
Oh, I play a lot
of "wheels of anger."

16:57.283 --> 16:59.517
I hate that game.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.352
Why, 'cause it glorifies crime?

17:01.354 --> 17:02.754
Nope.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.622
'Cause I can't get past
level three.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.225
- <i>( Tires screeching )</i>
<i>- Oh! Oh!</i>

17:07.227 --> 17:09.227
That's a red sedan.
That's our perp.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.862
Light 'em up, Mike.
Light 'em up!

17:10.864 --> 17:13.097
- <i>( Siren blares )</i>
<i>- Car 591, dispatch.</i>

17:13.099 --> 17:15.700

<i>- He's evading.</i>
<i>He's evading.</i>

17:15.702 --> 17:17.101
Oh yeah, he's evading.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.270
That is 12,000 bonus points.

17:19.272 --> 17:23.107
Car 591, we are in hot pursuit.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.844
I told you we'd have fun!

17:26.846 --> 17:29.180
This is awesome!

17:29.182 --> 17:30.681
Oh, turning left.
He's turning left.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.583
( Grunts )

17:32.585 --> 17:35.086
Oh, air support is closing in.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.055
Run, buddy, run!

17:37.057 --> 17:38.322
Hey.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.291
I'm sorry. I have never
played this game

17:40.293 --> 17:41.626
as the cop before.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.032
Come on, guys.
We can still have fun.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.102
Pizza and orange juice.

17:51.104 --> 17:55.339
But who wants to see
how they taste together?

17:57.176 --> 17:59.010
( Kids booing )

17:59.012 --> 18:02.313
I know we weren't all fans
of duck, duck, dinosaur,

18:02.315 --> 18:04.315
but there is something
waiting for you outside

18:04.317 --> 18:06.884
that is going to blow
your 10-year-old minds.

18:06.886 --> 18:07.952
I'm nine.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.689
Just come outside.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.726
Okay, but if there's
someone out there in
an elmo suit,

18:15.728 --> 18:17.095
I'm gonna lose it.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.899
( Squeals )

18:23.135 --> 18:25.636
Terry, cue my jam.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.472
<i>( Dance music playing )</i>

18:29.930 --> 18:31.276
Whoa, what did you do?

18:31.277 --> 18:35.046
It's Liv Rooney's
karate watermelon...

18:35.048 --> 18:36.681
¶ Smash-a-thon!

18:37.883 --> 18:40.118
Dojo bros,

18:40.120 --> 18:41.385
attack.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.354
Go, Parker!

18:43.356 --> 18:45.223
( Cheering )

18:45.225 --> 18:47.258
Come on, smash it!

18:49.128 --> 18:50.661
( Cheering )

18:57.302 --> 18:59.036
Whoo!

19:04.176 --> 19:05.209
Hiya!

19:05.211 --> 19:08.112
This is so awesome!

19:08.114 --> 19:09.780
Do you hear that, Liv?

19:09.782 --> 19:13.284
That's what playground buzz
sounds like.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.919
( Squeals )

19:14.921 --> 19:16.254
What I heard was a big sister

19:16.256 --> 19:18.789
finally bonding
with her little brother.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.792
I also heard Terry the clown
laying down some sick beats.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.327
( Beatboxing )

19:26.265 --> 19:28.099
Kids:
Whoo! Parker!

19:30.702 --> 19:33.271
( Kids groan )

19:33.273 --> 19:35.406
And that's when
those racecar fish sticks

19:35.408 --> 19:37.208
roared right out of me.

19:38.143 --> 19:39.177
( Retches )

19:39.179 --> 19:40.778
All: Ew.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.348
<i>( Dance music continues )</i>

19:50.789 --> 19:52.256
We've been chasing this dirtbag

19:52.258 --> 19:53.457
for like 50 Miles.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.359
How often does this happen?

19:55.361 --> 19:58.963
Just another day
in the life of a cop.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.232
You've never done this before,
have you, Mike?

20:01.234 --> 20:03.267
No.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.369
This is so awesome!

20:05.371 --> 20:07.305
Oh, he's stopping.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.306
Oh, you got him.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.942
Box him in, Mikey.
Box him in.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.378
You guys stay in here
while I track him down.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.281
But... take some pictures
of me in action?

20:17.283 --> 20:18.849
This never happens.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.285
<i>( Camera clicks )</i>

20:21.287 --> 20:23.321
Looks like we're not
gonna make it to

20:23.323 --> 20:24.322
the pastrami palace.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.724
Sorry?
Are you kidding me?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.259
This is the greatest
night of my life.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.794
Dad, you are so right.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.495
Life doesn't happen
on a video screen.

20:33.265 --> 20:34.932
I got my boy off the couch

20:34.934 --> 20:37.268
and showed him that life
could be pretty exciting.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.494
It was a good night.

20:41.273 --> 20:45.343
This is not the kind of
sandwich I had in mind.

20:45.345 --> 20:50.881
But I gotta take
these dirtbags back to
the station for processing.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.216
Officer Mike,

20:52.218 --> 20:54.785
how slowly can you drive?

20:58.890 --> 21:00.825
You really need
to hydrate, honey.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.226
You lost a lot of fluid...

21:02.228 --> 21:04.161
And solids.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.164
Mom, I'm fine.
I just...

21:08.133 --> 21:09.433
Tonight was
a complete disaster.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.534
Oh no, sweetie.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.803
I got to watch
four episodes of...

21:12.805 --> 21:14.338
oh, for you.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.775
I mean, that's what I get
for being away for so long.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.144
I just really wanted
Parker to see me

21:20.146 --> 21:22.146
as his cool older sister,

21:22.148 --> 21:25.950
and instead I am a girl
who can't hold her fish sticks.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.086
Hey, guys.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.388
Hey.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.556
Parker, I'm really sorry
I ruined your party.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.091
Are you kidding?

21:34.093 --> 21:36.093
Between blasting watermelons,

21:36.095 --> 21:37.862
you spewing like a volcano

21:37.864 --> 21:40.531
and that clown's sweet tunes...

21:42.100 --> 21:43.834
I'm gonna have
more playground buzz

21:43.836 --> 21:45.569
than Stevie hudacky's
sleepover.

21:45.571 --> 21:47.905
Wait, so the boys
like the party?

21:47.907 --> 21:49.140
Check it out.

21:49.142 --> 21:53.411
<i>( Kids laughing )</i>

21:53.413 --> 21:56.480
Ooh, I'm a big
Hollywood actress.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.418
Oh! You hit me
in the belly

22:00.420 --> 22:02.153
with the melon.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.389
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna...

22:05.391 --> 22:06.824
( retches )

22:06.826 --> 22:10.428
( Chuckles )

22:10.430 --> 22:12.296
I'll never forget this night.

22:12.298 --> 22:15.032
Thanks, Liv.
It's so great
to have you back.

22:18.403 --> 22:19.904
Hey.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.305
If you really want
playground buzz,

22:21.307 --> 22:23.441
I am pretty sure I saw a possum

22:23.443 --> 22:25.409
eating my puddle
of barf in the backyard.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.477
( Laughs )

22:26.479 --> 22:29.613
Come on, boys,
the show's not over.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.215
( Cheering )

22:40.158 --> 22:42.293
Willow, this is
gonna work great.

22:42.295 --> 22:44.495
I'm so glad we found this
in the Halloween stuff.

22:44.497 --> 22:47.198
<i>I also found this gem.</i>

22:49.368 --> 22:51.168
Ohh!

22:51.170 --> 22:53.237
Let them eat cake!
( Laughs )

22:56.441 --> 22:58.008
You ready to do this?

22:58.010 --> 22:59.643
Let's crank it to
its highest notch

22:59.645 --> 23:01.679
and see what this baby
can really do.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.615
- Drop it like it's hot.
- Drop it like it's hot!

23:09.888 --> 23:10.955
( Laughs )

23:12.057 --> 23:13.591
( Screaming )

23:13.593 --> 23:16.293
Zee head!
I want zee head!

23:16.295 --> 23:18.028
( Screaming continues )

23:21.299 --> 23:23.401
I love your family,
Mrs. Rooney.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.503
Oh, thank you, Evan.
That is so sweet.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.304
I don't care what my mom says.

23:27.306 --> 23:28.973
The bad parents
are the fun ones.
