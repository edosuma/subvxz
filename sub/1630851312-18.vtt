Bam.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.141
Queen of hearts? Oh, babe.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.752
Even when you're not on my team,
you help me win.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.189
Eh.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.755
Come on, Dave,
slap that spade on her.

00:16.799 --> 00:17.756
Let's go, baby.DAVE:
All right.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.629
Coming right up.[phone ringing]

00:21.847 --> 00:23.240
I'm sorry, I got to take this.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.286
Hello, Terrence. Again.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.417
CALVIN:
Hey, hurry up, man.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.289
This is Spades.
This is not a game.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.248
[scoffs]
He's been on that phone all day.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.250
Yeah, it's his new
mediation clients.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.470
Two rich brothers
who don't get along.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.601
CALVIN:
Uh, well,

00:36.645 --> 00:38.125
there's gonna be a mediation

00:38.168 --> 00:39.561
between me and him,
if he doesn't come over here

00:39.604 --> 00:41.258
and help us win this book.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.609
Hey, sorry about that, guys.
Okay, where were we?

00:44.653 --> 00:47.134
Oh, we were talking about
your jackass clients.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.701
Well, as their mediator,
I can't say that.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.094
Yeah, well, I can.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.531
Look, lately, all of your
clients have been--

00:53.575 --> 00:57.318
how can I put this nicely--
total jackasses.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.626
You haven't been happy
at work in a long time.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.238
Well, maybe not, but if I can
get these guys to agree

01:04.281 --> 01:05.674
on where to build
their new factory,

01:05.717 --> 01:08.676
not only will it create,
well, a lot of jobs,

01:08.720 --> 01:10.679
but happy Dave will return.

01:10.722 --> 01:11.723
Hmm.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.116
Happy Dave needs

01:13.160 --> 01:14.551
to return his ass
back to this game.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.511
Mm, yeah.Let's go, baby.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.339
So, what you got? What you got?Okay, all right.
Let's do this.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.384
We're about to run
a Baltimore on you two.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.385
[laughter]

01:21.429 --> 01:22.473
No.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.127
It's called a Boston, Dave,

01:24.170 --> 01:26.434
but good trash talk, man.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.392
Come on, man.
Hit them with it, baby.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.655
Well, let's g... Sorry.[phone ringing]

01:30.699 --> 01:32.701
It's the other brother.
I'm so sorry. There you go.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.833
[shouts]
Our book.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.661
No, no, no, baby, no,
he was distracted.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.794
That's a do-over.
That's a do-over.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.274
No, no do-overs, okay?

01:40.317 --> 01:41.926
This is Spades.
This ain't a game!

01:41.971 --> 01:44.669
Nope.
[laughs]

01:44.713 --> 01:47.324
Know what? That's it for me.

01:47.368 --> 01:50.371
I'm never being Dave's partner
on anything ever again.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.503
Okay, well, I got them
off my back for now,

01:52.547 --> 01:54.679
but guess
we're playing golf tomorrow

01:54.723 --> 01:56.899
at the very exclusive
Samora Country Club.

01:56.942 --> 01:59.423
I just have to find a fourth.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.339

Man, look at this place.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.440
There are countries smaller
than this course.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.443
I got to get in good
with these guys

02:19.487 --> 02:20.836
so I can get invited back.

02:20.879 --> 02:24.274
Well, that's fine, but just
remember, this whole day

02:24.318 --> 02:26.494
is about getting the Wilton
brothers to relax

02:26.537 --> 02:28.452
and agree where to build
their new factory,

02:28.496 --> 02:30.541
so just be cool
and leave everything to me.

02:30.585 --> 02:31.803
[laughs, stammers]

02:31.847 --> 02:34.023
You telling meto be cool?

02:34.893 --> 02:37.287
Dave, I'm always cool.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.856
Wow. Is that Sylvester Stallone?

02:40.899 --> 02:43.641
Yo. What's up?

02:43.685 --> 02:46.078
Ooh, Calvin.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.602
Calvin. Here they come.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.560
What a splendid day.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.346
The air
is positively salubrious.

02:54.086 --> 02:57.655
Uh, hey, uh, Terrence,
this is my friend, Calvin.

What's up, Terrence?Hello.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.092
Hmm, firm shake there.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.965
You strike me as a Columbia man.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.314
Am I right?

03:04.358 --> 03:06.098
Uh, no. I've been to Cabo.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.666
Hey, don't sleep
on those cruises.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.841
They got everything.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.016

03:11.060 --> 03:12.583
This fellow's a riot.

03:12.627 --> 03:13.802
Where is my brother?

03:13.845 --> 03:15.717

03:29.905 --> 03:31.820
Jordan Wilton.
What's happening, fellas?

03:33.082 --> 03:34.692
Terrence.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.478
Once again, Jordan,
your punctuality

03:37.521 --> 03:38.522
is not your strong suit.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.960
Oh, lighten up. I'm on RPT.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.876
That's Rich People Time.
I'm never late.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.966
Well, then, you were tardy
for yesterday's board meeting.

03:48.010 --> 03:50.926
Yeah, you're right, man.
"Bored."

03:51.970 --> 03:54.103
Can you stop talking?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.366
I come bearing gifts.

03:56.410 --> 04:01.545
I have here
24 karat gold golf tees.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.854
[chuckles]
24 karat gold?

04:05.897 --> 04:08.900
I'm-a commemorate my
retirement with this.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.555
All right, guys,
we can talk business later.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.383
Calvin, you're riding with me.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.472
You two loving brothers
are together.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.733
Fine, but I don't
want to listen

04:16.778 --> 04:18.127
to loud music with
all that bass.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.911
It's demeaning.
It shakes my insides.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.089
Well, maybe I should
turn up those heated seats,

04:24.133 --> 04:26.657
to loosen up your sphincter
so that stick will fall out.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.793
Wow.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.969
Dave, you got to deal with
people like that all the time?

04:34.012 --> 04:36.711
Well, yeah, I mean,
I fix people's problems,

04:36.754 --> 04:39.931
so I get a lot of people
with a lot of problems.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.412
Well, I'm glad I just fix cars.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.196
Cars don't talk back.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.111
If all goes well,
by the end of the day,

04:46.155 --> 04:47.808
they'll be as close
as you and me.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.419
TERRENCE: You unhand me
before I sue you again!

04:49.463 --> 04:51.595
JORDAN:
Family does not sue family.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.946
Wow, are you sure about that?

04:54.990 --> 04:56.905
Ah, you know, it's nothing.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.123
I-- Remember when we first met?

04:58.167 --> 05:00.169
You wanted to put
your house up for sale.

05:00.212 --> 05:03.433
Look at us now.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.130
Dave, don't make me
call my Realtor.
All right.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.963
Yeesh. Are all of these
clothes for the birthday party

05:12.007 --> 05:13.835
that Grover's going to?Yeah.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.924
He couldn't decide what outfit
he wanted to wear.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.013
Oh. Someone's got a crush.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.884
[scoffs]

05:19.928 --> 05:21.712
What? No way.

05:21.756 --> 05:22.887
Well, has he been

05:22.931 --> 05:24.193
taking a lot of showers lately

05:24.236 --> 05:25.716
without you telling him?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.806
Well, sure. He has to wash off
all that Axe body spray.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.025
Oh, my God!

05:31.940 --> 05:35.030
My baby has a crush on a girl.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.815
Oh. I have to ask him about her.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.862
Eh, uh, but be casual,
because if you scare him away,

05:40.905 --> 05:42.733
he's not gonna
talk to you about it.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.474
Tina, I work with kids all day.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.694
I know how to deal with them.
I'll be smooth, girl.

05:46.737 --> 05:47.782
All right.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.827
Which shirt do you like?

05:49.871 --> 05:50.872
Do you have a crush on a girl?

05:50.915 --> 05:52.700
[stammers]

05:52.743 --> 05:54.266
Uh, yeah, real smooth.

05:54.310 --> 05:57.052
What? No.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.272
Okay, maybe I kind of like

06:00.316 --> 06:01.796
this girl named Molly Martin.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.058
She's Andy's cousin.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.886
Aw. Is she pretty?

06:04.929 --> 06:07.149
Mom, can we just focus
on the shirts? Which one?

06:07.192 --> 06:10.587
Oh, uh, right. The blue one.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.546
Okay, great.
The blue one's definitely out.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.724
I'm gonna find Malcolm and
Marty to get their opinion.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.815
We should look up this Molly
Martin girl on Instagram.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.600
You know,
you parents today got it easy.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.036
Back in the day,
I would've had to drive

06:25.080 --> 06:26.560
around the neighborhood yelling,

06:26.603 --> 06:28.997
"Does anybody know Molly?
Is she cute?"

06:32.609 --> 06:34.045
Oh...

06:34.089 --> 06:35.220
Yes.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.571
Only missed it
by a couple of inches.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.225
Let's celebrate.

06:40.269 --> 06:43.838
Calvin, I'm gonna treat you
to a $10,000 cognac.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.232
Did he say cognac or Pontiac?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.931
Either way, I want it.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.804
All right, I'm going to
negotiate with Terrence.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.632
You keep Jordan occupied.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.895
[chuckles]
You ain't got to threaten me
with a good time.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.726
Hey, Terrence. Looks like, uh,

07:02.770 --> 07:05.033
this one's gonna break
a little bit left.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.730
Well, thank you
for your good counsel.

07:06.774 --> 07:10.342
Here's some more advice. You
should talk to your brother.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.170
[grunts softly]You know, there's
something about coming

07:12.214 --> 07:16.044
from the same womb that just,
well, it bonds you, you know?

07:16.087 --> 07:17.872
No.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.961
B-But I appreciate you
trying to bring us together.

07:20.004 --> 07:23.138
Even though it does conjure up
images of my mother's anatomy.

07:24.356 --> 07:27.272
Well, y-you know
what, Terrence,

07:27.316 --> 07:29.361
you know what's so great
about New York City?

07:29.405 --> 07:32.800
It's an island. You can
park your yacht anywhere.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.671
Mm. Hmm.

07:34.715 --> 07:37.282
I hear you, Dave.
And I'll think about it.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.023
All right.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.982
Now, how you like that?

07:41.025 --> 07:44.681
I couldn't really tell.
I might need another one.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.161
That's fine with me.

07:47.641 --> 07:50.339
You know, I've never
had this much money

07:50.382 --> 07:53.037
in my stomach before.
[chuckles]

07:53.081 --> 07:54.909
And I once swallowed
my wife's wedding ring.

07:54.952 --> 07:57.433
Those were a rough
couple of days.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.089
So, off the record,

08:01.132 --> 08:04.701
my brother, he's like
a nap with two legs, ain't he?

08:04.745 --> 08:06.616
[chuckles]

08:06.660 --> 08:10.141
Yeah, the guy's like an
audiobook that you can't pause.

08:10.185 --> 08:14.319
[laughs]
I nodded off on
holes three and four.

08:14.363 --> 08:18.019
You know what? You just earned
yourself another shot.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.674
Ho! Let's go.[phone chiming]

08:20.717 --> 08:21.762
Oh, hold on.
Hmm.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.286
It's my boy Elon.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.723
He wants to give me a new car.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.073
Do you want a Tesla?

08:29.117 --> 08:31.293
Hell yeah, I want a Tesla, man!

08:32.860 --> 08:34.034
Switch.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.384
Your turn to putt with Terrence.N-No, Dave,

08:35.427 --> 08:36.994
we're just talking about
my new Tesla that I...

08:37.038 --> 08:39.431
Switch! I said switch!Okay. Dave.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.086
You don't have to get so loud.
I'm switching.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.307
Aha.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.004
I see you want to take part
in this nectar?

08:47.048 --> 08:48.789
Oh, uh, no, thank you.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.181
Uh, I think there's
a time and place

08:50.225 --> 08:51.879
for everything,
and you know what?

08:51.922 --> 08:54.098
There is a good time and place
to think about

08:54.142 --> 08:56.274
what's best for your company.

08:56.318 --> 08:57.972
Now, Jordan,

08:58.015 --> 09:00.365
I know you like
to do things big.

09:00.409 --> 09:03.194
But in Nashville,
you could do 'em even bigger.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.848
You know what that is?

09:04.892 --> 09:07.024
Huge.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.722
You know what?

09:08.765 --> 09:11.812
Between the cognac,
my head and your words,

09:11.855 --> 09:13.248
you're starting to make sense.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.383
Ah. Nah, it's the cognac.

09:18.427 --> 09:19.950
[chuckles]

09:19.994 --> 09:22.387
So, your professional advice

09:22.431 --> 09:24.694
is that I should open up
more auto shops?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.130
No, no, no, not you.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.697
You should franchise them.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.960
You make the little guy
make you money. Hmm?

09:30.004 --> 09:31.701
[chuckles]

09:31.745 --> 09:34.095
This is some good stuff, man.
I need to write this down.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.705
Oh, don't worry about it,
don't worry about it.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.142
We'll-we'll discuss it all
next weekend right here.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.318
[mouths]
[chuckles]

09:40.362 --> 09:41.885
You know, I'll even
share my secret

09:41.929 --> 09:44.409
on how I garnered
my first billion.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.107
Your first billion?[laughs]

09:46.150 --> 09:47.978
I need to get me
some little guys.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.153
[both laugh]

09:49.197 --> 09:51.155
Calvin, we're cut
from the same cloth.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.331
Smart businessmen.
Not like my brother over there

09:53.375 --> 09:55.333
who flushes
money down the toilet.

09:55.377 --> 09:58.206
Seriously, he thinks
it's good for the plumbing.

09:58.249 --> 10:02.906
Yeah, he does spend money like
a third world dictator, right?

10:02.950 --> 10:04.299
But without the fun little hat.

10:08.912 --> 10:11.567
All right, little man.
Let's see the outfit.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.092
[laughs]:Oh...

10:15.136 --> 10:16.485
Okay.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.967
Hey, see, this is the one.
You look good, man.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.404
I'm trying to look cool,
like J-Hope from BTS.

10:24.841 --> 10:27.757
Molly loves him, but J-Hope's
hair is straighter than mine,

10:27.801 --> 10:29.324
so I thought I could use this.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.762
Mama's hair perm?

10:32.806 --> 10:34.764
Yeah, uh...
[clears throat]

10:34.808 --> 10:36.331
Grover, you can't use this.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.159
Why?

10:38.202 --> 10:39.551
It says my hair will be
flat and silky.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.162
It's exactly what I want.

10:42.990 --> 10:46.297
Uh, little boy, um...

10:46.341 --> 10:49.170
hair straighteners have
strong chemicals in them.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.519
You can't mess around
with this stuff.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.913
Okay. I'll put it back.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.437
[laughs]
Man.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.526
You know, today he's trying
to look like J-Hope,

10:57.569 --> 10:59.310
and tomorrow
it's Michael B. Jordan.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.835
Ah. Well, I mean, let's be real.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.924
We are all trying to look
like Michael B. Jordan.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.142
Yeah.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.973
[laughter]CALVIN:
Not bad. Not-not bad.

11:10.017 --> 11:13.063
Okay, all right, my turn.
I got one.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.849
Why did the golfer bring
an extra pair of pants?

11:15.892 --> 11:16.937
Why?

11:16.980 --> 11:19.156
In case he got a hole in one.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.202
[laughter]I know.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.073
I know it's corny,
but it's good.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.206
See that? Laughter truly
is the best medicine.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.381
L-Look at this.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.817
Two titans of industry

11:27.861 --> 11:29.166
finding common ground.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.080
CALVIN:
Oh.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.081
To common ground.Yeah.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.300
To common ground.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.475
CALVIN: Hey.TERRENCE:
You know, Jordan,

11:33.518 --> 11:35.259
I'm ready to work this out.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.827
If you could just refrain from--
how did you put it, Calvin?

11:37.871 --> 11:39.002
Spending money

11:39.046 --> 11:40.003
like a third world dictator

11:40.047 --> 11:41.135
without the fun hats.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.268
You said that?

11:44.312 --> 11:45.313
[stammers]

11:45.356 --> 11:46.401
I got plenty of fun hats.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.359
CALVIN:
Look,

11:48.403 --> 11:52.146
I-I said it, but remember,
tone is everything.

11:52.189 --> 11:55.149
W-Well, maybe
I misunderstand your tone

11:55.192 --> 11:57.499
when you said that my brother
was so boring

11:57.542 --> 12:01.372
that you fell asleep
on holes three and four.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.635
I beg your pardon?

12:03.679 --> 12:06.029
You know, once again, tone, man.

12:06.073 --> 12:08.031
You know? Tone.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.468
Guys, guys,
we were doing so well.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.601
Let's be escalators
and keep moving up.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.865
Well, this escalator's
going down.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.171
You know what?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.389
I think Calvin's playing us.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.217
CALVIN:
Jordan, come on, man,

12:20.261 --> 12:21.349
I was just messing around...

12:21.392 --> 12:22.698
I'm out!

12:26.093 --> 12:27.485
No Tesla for you.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.621
You know, it's people like you
who make people like us

12:32.664 --> 12:34.362
stay away from people like you.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.672
[groans]

12:40.716 --> 12:42.631
Well, that took a turn.

12:42.674 --> 12:46.287
No kidding. I just lost a Tesla.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.862
Look, Dave.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.690
I know getting these two
brothers together was important.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.171
Mm-hmm.I-I hope I didn't
mess that up for you.

13:01.215 --> 13:04.609
But those guys were ticked off.

13:06.611 --> 13:07.699
Yes.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.832
But the good news is,

13:09.876 --> 13:11.834
they're not ticked off
at each other anymore.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.837
Now they're mad
at somebody else.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.100
[chuckles]
What did you do, Dave?

13:20.147 --> 13:21.670
No. No, no.

13:21.713 --> 13:24.716
Uh, not me, you.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.939
Now I can use what's
called strategic leverage.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.550
A common enemy always
brings people together.

13:32.594 --> 13:36.250
Now we just need to get them
to focus their anger at you.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.993
I don't know,
that sounds dangerous.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.561
But, hey, that's okay.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.042
Because if one of them fools
put their hands on me,

13:46.086 --> 13:50.220
their company's going to be
Wilton, Wilton and Calvin.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.656
You can believe that.

13:55.269 --> 13:58.750
Yes. I found
Molly's Instagram page.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.317
Ooh.[gasps]

14:00.361 --> 14:02.232
Oh, she went to STEM camp.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.844
So she's smart.
Mm-hmm.

14:04.887 --> 14:08.195
Wait a minute. This girl is 13?

14:08.238 --> 14:11.851
Okay. Well, Grover's found
himself a cougar.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.765
No...
Oh.

14:13.809 --> 14:17.726
Tina, that is not funny. She's
way too mature for Grover.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.206
Oh, please,
they're just a year apart.

14:19.249 --> 14:22.252
U-Uh, a year is a
lifetime at that age.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.298
Girls are way more advanced.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.301
In puberty years, she's
a 33-year-old divorcée,

14:27.344 --> 14:29.042
newly single and
ready to mingle.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.784
Uh, Mom. I think I
did something wrong.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.221
My head's itching and tingling.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.787
What? What did you put
in your hair?

14:35.831 --> 14:38.616
I took Miss Tina's straightener
to flatten my hair.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.270
[gasps]Boy, you put my perm

14:40.314 --> 14:41.837
in your hair?

14:42.838 --> 14:45.667
You didn't see that whole
Black lady on the box?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.843
[shouts] Now it's burning! Help!Oh, no. What do we do?
What do we do?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.976
Okay, take him over to the sink.
We got wash it out.Okay, okay, okay.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.978
Okay. O-Okay. Uh,
don't worry, baby.All right, bring it over, okay.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.762
Okay?Here, I'll turn it on. Okay.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.895
Don't worry, baby,
it's gonna be fine.It's gonna be okay.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.722
It will be fine, right, Tina?

14:57.766 --> 15:00.682
Uh, eventually.

15:04.686 --> 15:09.996
Man, I can't believe the valet
lost all of our car keys.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.825
The incompetent plebs.

15:13.869 --> 15:19.005
Siri, order me a helicopter
to pick me up in 15 minutes.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.921
Does Two-Face have to be here?

15:23.183 --> 15:25.750
More like the Joker.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.839
You know the one who did
the weird dance on the stairs.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.145
Remember him?[laughs]

15:29.189 --> 15:31.756
Oh, that is so funny.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.236
You know what's not funny?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.151
When your ass is broke
in two years,

15:35.195 --> 15:36.892
and the closest
you'll get to a Tesla

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
is when you're washing one.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.332
Easy there, bro.

15:42.376 --> 15:45.161
He's still family,
and he has an emergency fund.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.337
I-I forgot to tell you, uh,

15:47.381 --> 15:48.730
I spent that.What?

15:49.905 --> 15:52.690
Yeah, yeah, uh,
Calvin, ease up.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.866
No, no, no, I'm keeping it real.

15:54.910 --> 15:59.132
And you, Mr. I Make Billions
Off the Little Guy,

15:59.175 --> 16:00.829
how do you sleep at night?

16:00.872 --> 16:02.309
Hanging upside down?

16:04.398 --> 16:06.878
Wait a minute, now,
you're talking to my brother.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.185
You don't want
any of this smoke.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.360
[laughs]
Smoke?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.188
Man, I got cigars
bigger than you.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.103
[stammers]

16:14.147 --> 16:16.845
You keep up with this
defamation, you vulgarian,

16:16.888 --> 16:18.281
I'll tie you up
in court so long,

16:18.325 --> 16:20.022
your grandchildren
will need lawyers.

16:21.763 --> 16:22.851
Way to go, T.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.200
What?

16:26.246 --> 16:30.032
Now, look at that.
You guys cansee eye to eye.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.773
Now, why not
come to an agreement

16:31.816 --> 16:33.818
on where the new factory
should be built?

16:33.862 --> 16:34.776
JORDAN:
No.
No.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.299
Great, still on the same page.

16:36.343 --> 16:40.173
Now, Jordan, why are you
so stuck on New York?

16:40.216 --> 16:42.740
The nightlife, baby.

16:42.784 --> 16:46.875
Okay, and, Terrence, what
do you love about Nashville?

16:46.918 --> 16:48.746
The tax breaks, obviously.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.313
Okay, well, is there
any place that you guys

16:50.357 --> 16:54.013
could have both the nightlife
and the tax break?

16:55.362 --> 16:56.319
Vegas.Vegas.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.320
I said it first.

16:57.364 --> 16:58.887
But I thought it first.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.237
It doesn't matter.
You guys came to an agreement.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.979
And in the state of California,
especially on a golf course,

17:04.022 --> 17:05.111
verbal agreements are binding.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.502
Don't look it up.

17:07.548 --> 17:08.983
You see what happens

17:09.028 --> 17:10.464
when you guys compromise?

17:10.507 --> 17:12.031
Too soon.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.816
Don't ruin this, Calvin.

17:17.165 --> 17:18.515
Did you really spend
your emergency fund?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.343
Uh, way gone.
And some of yours, too.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.086
Well,

17:24.130 --> 17:25.348
thanks for your help, Calvin.Yeah.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.872
And I'm sorry
that they were so rude.

17:27.915 --> 17:30.179
Hey, not a problem.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.400
I just found out
that this gold tee

17:33.443 --> 17:35.967
is worth about eight grand, man.What?

17:36.011 --> 17:38.187
Give me that.
I got to tip my pilot.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.931
Don't worry, Calvin.
I'll split mine with you.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.150
Ah.

17:44.193 --> 17:47.066
This is going back
in the emergency fund.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.809
Excuse me, miss.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.985
Is their tab still open?

17:54.029 --> 17:56.466
We'll take four lobsters to go.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.207
Okay? Thank you.

17:58.251 --> 18:01.036
Oh, and, uh,
don't skimp on the butter.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.301
Ugh, I needed this.

18:05.345 --> 18:08.087
I can't believe the miracle
you pulled off on Grover's hair

18:08.130 --> 18:10.437
with just a pair of
scissors and a Sharpie.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.135
Ooh. Well, I had
to fill in that bald spot.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.528
Mm.
I hope he didn't sweat.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.269
[both laugh]

18:18.271 --> 18:20.316
It hurt my feelings a bit
that Grover didn't want me

18:20.360 --> 18:22.579
to pick him up from the party.

18:22.623 --> 18:24.451
I can't believe I won't be
the most important woman

18:24.494 --> 18:26.148
in his life soon.

18:26.192 --> 18:30.065
Yeah, he's growing up, but trust
me, nobody can replace Mama,

18:30.109 --> 18:32.154
as long as you keep
that fridge stocked.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.590
[laughs]GROVER:
Mom.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.331
In here, honey.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.159
Yeah-- I'll come to you.Ah...

18:37.203 --> 18:38.552
Don't be so desperate.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.077
Hey. How was the party?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.209
Fun.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.906
Everybody liked my new look.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.212
Including Krista.

18:46.255 --> 18:49.345
What, what happened to Molly?

18:49.389 --> 18:51.347
Oh, yeah, I'm still
talking to her, too.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.262
[laughs]:
Oh!

18:53.306 --> 18:54.481
Player.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.876
There is nothing good
to eat in here.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.575
Uh-- Come on, little man.
Let's go get some real food.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.928
Let's go to my mama's house.[laughs]

19:06.971 --> 19:09.017
You see what he said?
My house.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.585
See, trust me, as long
as you keep a steady supply

19:11.628 --> 19:14.370
of deli meats and spray cheese
in your fridge,

19:14.414 --> 19:16.024
he'll be yours forever.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.417
[laughs]

19:22.987 --> 19:25.076
You were pretty quiet
on the ride home.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.253
Even when "Livin' on a Prayer"
came on.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.909
You know,
you should be proud.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.694
You helped create
a lot of jobs today.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.218
Yeah, I know.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.873
And I know that that's a good
thing, but, man... [exhales]

19:38.916 --> 19:40.701
...the Wiltons were exhausting.

19:40.744 --> 19:44.792
And they just asked me
to be their in-house mediator,

19:44.835 --> 19:47.664
and they're offering me
a ton of money.

19:47.708 --> 19:51.233
That's great news.
Why don't you tell your face?

19:52.582 --> 19:54.236
Well, because it's my heart

19:54.280 --> 19:55.585
that doesn't think
that it's great.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.457
Then buy a new heart.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.025
Okay, for real, man.
What's going on?

20:02.679 --> 20:05.769
Look, all my clients are these
rich people that I just...

20:05.813 --> 20:07.467
I can't relate to.

20:07.510 --> 20:10.557
Or, as Gemma calls them,
"jackasses."

20:12.036 --> 20:14.865
You know, lately I've been
volunteering at the V.A.,

20:14.909 --> 20:17.999
and I just wish that working
with people like the Wiltons

20:18.042 --> 20:21.568
was as fulfilling
as working with the veterans.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.657
Well, if you enjoy it so much,

20:23.700 --> 20:25.746
why don't you try to get
a job at the V.A.?

20:27.008 --> 20:28.966
You know, actually,
they offered me a job.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.968
But I don't know,
the money's not as good,

20:31.012 --> 20:33.580
and obviously I have
to think about my family.

20:33.623 --> 20:37.497
Yeah, man, but you being happy
is good for you,

20:37.540 --> 20:39.063
which is good for your family.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.850
I mean, the way I see it,
if you find a job you love,

20:42.893 --> 20:45.374
you never have to work
a day in your life.

20:48.638 --> 20:51.598
Wow, Calvin. That's pretty good.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.295
You just make that up?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.819
No. No, it's right here
on the back of this lobster bag.
