WEBVTT

02:56.600 --> 02:58.240
Oga Richie. Oga Rich, sir.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.160
What am I supposed to do? What am I to do?

06:15.480 --> 06:18.840
Hurry up and bath.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.680
Let's go to a party--

06:29.320 --> 06:30.680
If you weren’t boring, babes,

06:30.760 --> 06:35.240
I would take you partying, spoil you.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.480
But you’re boring.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.320
Here is my rent, babes.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.680
And I think next time I go partying,
you have to come with me.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.400
‎I'm off to bath.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.440
-You're a houseboy.
-God, hope you're hearing.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.240
Hope you're hearing all my heart cry.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.320
Silly man, I tell you I'm hungry
and you're fooling around.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.560
I want to help you,
saying babes like things like this.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.720
Hey, piss off!
Don't give me that attitude!

17:16.160 --> 17:17.359
-Really?
-Imagine.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.119
Does he think you're playing games?

17:30.840 --> 17:34.160
Friend, you know I'm broke.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.600
-Playing games here.
-I'm not playing games.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.040
Let's get them.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.560
What do we have here?

18:33.640 --> 18:34.840
‎Let me see.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.920
And he's like yellow.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.560
Just like me, hey?

18:46.640 --> 18:49.520
I'll send him a message.
What should I say?

18:49.600 --> 18:50.920
Say…

18:56.760 --> 18:59.440
Then say…

18:59.520 --> 19:00.440
Four times.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.920
‎No, three times. That's too much.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.680
-Is four too much?
-Three is perfect.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.040
-Oh.
-What?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.840
‎Already replied.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.640
‎I enjoy the fruits of your labor.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.040
You're lazy.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.600
But you're my friend, aren't you?

19:48.880 --> 19:50.800
We're not here to play around.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.120
‎Am I pretty?

20:03.680 --> 20:06.160
Move. Don't let him see you.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.560
‎Right?

21:58.320 --> 21:59.880
-Hello.
-What are you watching?

21:59.960 --> 22:01.160
‎What are you looking for here?

22:05.400 --> 22:08.400
If you are passing, walk past. Why you
watching someone's house like that?

22:33.320 --> 22:35.360
So you're here to visit or to work?

22:48.680 --> 22:50.680
-No.
-You have no permit?

23:06.440 --> 23:09.600
That's right. You must get
a permit to work here.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.000
You can't just come like that
from Ghana and work here.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.600
-Sorry.
-Thank-you, very much.

23:23.680 --> 23:24.760
‎Go on, leave.

23:27.320 --> 23:31.280
I'm working and you're looking,
how would I know you're not a thief.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.640
‎…you take whatever you see from me.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.600
Let go of me!

29:35.040 --> 29:37.240
-Take this girl away, quickly!
-Ah, shut up.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.560
What are you even doing here?

29:40.600 --> 29:42.120
Come, come, come, come.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.640
Throw her out in the streets.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.800
Seems like this guy is crazy.

30:25.920 --> 30:30.040
-Yahoo boy with tum--.
-Can a Southie yahoo scam a Nigerian guy?

30:30.120 --> 30:31.840
Impossi-can't. Calm down.

32:27.720 --> 32:31.560
‎Clive sent me pictures
‎of his cars and house.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.080
It doesn't suit you.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.920
And tomorrow is right now, so
where's the rent?

32:51.760 --> 32:54.600
Friend, can you pay it for me this month?

32:57.480 --> 32:59.320
‎Babes, you want me to pay it for you?

33:00.720 --> 33:05.200
‎What is my rent money compared
‎to those rich guys you hang out with?

33:05.320 --> 33:08.080
Oh, okay. You want me to spend my…

33:08.640 --> 33:12.840
shoe budget and pay your rent?

33:13.160 --> 33:16.000
No, babes. Hustle.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.800
You can be grumpy
after our selfie. Come on.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.880
What will he do
if he finds me like this? What then?

34:49.960 --> 34:52.719
I think I should bath and put makeup on

34:52.800 --> 34:54.719
‎and you should do the same.
‎Then maybe we can get

34:54.880 --> 34:57.040
a rich man for you too.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.560
You know I don't care for rich men.

34:59.640 --> 35:04.200
Well, I do. Unless you want to be a hobo.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.760
‎Take a bath…

38:28.840 --> 38:31.600
Sorry, ma'am. One moment, please?

40:44.600 --> 40:46.680
And kaboom, then she ran.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.000
The friend of all friends.

41:18.000 --> 41:18.880
Where is he?

46:11.360 --> 46:13.520
-Don't know.
-Hey, you. Richard.

46:15.960 --> 46:18.720
-No.
-Don't make me crazy, boy!

49:43.200 --> 49:44.560
Are you crazy?

49:57.280 --> 49:58.880
Stupid idiot.

49:59.320 --> 50:02.920
No, look. Don't speak.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.640
Don't speak.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.960
‎What's your problem, anyway?

50:10.040 --> 50:11.720
Come, let me tell you something.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.080
All right, wait...

50:16.160 --> 50:19.040
I said, wait, just be patient.

51:12.600 --> 51:15.680
Brother, what's going on?
I hear you're looking for me.

51:15.760 --> 51:16.600
Where were you?

51:24.360 --> 51:26.840
-Yes, sir.
-Oh boy, I wish I could be like you.

51:39.960 --> 51:41.360
You know how it is.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.080
But man,

51:44.800 --> 51:46.200
‎I'm tired of it.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.600
-Yeah.
-Brother, you're trying.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.440
-It's not easy now.
-Hmm.

52:00.440 --> 52:02.480
-You should try that someday.
-I'm making the effort.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.040
What about the job thing? How's it going?

52:17.800 --> 52:20.040
What's wrong with you?
On the 'net? Are you a yahoo boy?

52:23.480 --> 52:24.800
‎You're not a child.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.920
Com-, com- what?

52:43.000 --> 52:45.240
Tunde Ednut. They're so many.

52:47.240 --> 52:50.760
Is it an HR person? Who? Tunde what?

52:52.320 --> 52:54.680
This guy, seems like
it's really yahoo you want to do.

52:54.760 --> 52:56.480
No, no, I don't want to do yahoo.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.760
Gmail or Hotmail.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.000
Please, come here.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.160
Any problem?
Is there any-- Hope no problem.

53:43.200 --> 53:44.560
You want to tell me I'm crazy?

53:57.320 --> 53:58.600
Smell your beard.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.440
Isn't that your smell?

54:14.080 --> 54:17.760
‎Smell it, that's a man's smell.

54:18.520 --> 54:20.720
Brother, don't act this way.

54:20.800 --> 54:21.760
-This is--
-It's you.

54:21.840 --> 54:22.920
‎Who did you bring here?

54:23.000 --> 54:24.360
So you didn't bring anyone here?

54:25.880 --> 54:27.160
‎Because it's a man's smell on that pillow.

54:27.240 --> 54:30.040
-Or did you bring a man here?
-Brother, you know me, I like women.

54:30.120 --> 54:32.160
-I don't do men.
-Richard, this whole...

54:32.240 --> 54:34.120
This whole place is smelling like Richard.

54:34.200 --> 54:37.080
It's smelling like Richard.

54:37.160 --> 54:40.120
Now Richard, go and wash this thing away.

54:42.760 --> 54:45.040
Brother Reggie, this is not me. I swear.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.200
What's the problem?

55:03.000 --> 55:04.840
I wish you can ask me that again.

55:24.280 --> 55:25.400
Aren't you a man?

55:31.000 --> 55:33.360
-Why are you stressing yourself?
-It's easy for you to say.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.960
We have plenty ways
of getting these kinds of things.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.320
‎If the police see you,
‎if the police blinks its eye at you,

56:00.400 --> 56:02.160
You can tell them to buzz off.

56:21.960 --> 56:24.080
-Hmm.
-Hah. The girls here?

56:24.400 --> 56:26.120
Don't make me talk too much.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.960
You don't have?

56:35.280 --> 56:38.440
-No, mine is--
-Hey, stop lying to yourself.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.440
‎You don't...You shouldn't ask.
‎Go ask the girls.

57:35.440 --> 57:36.960
‎or you want a new roommate?

58:25.880 --> 58:27.520
‎Watch me, okay?

58:37.600 --> 58:39.480
‎Like a bath.

58:39.680 --> 58:40.880
‎Never in my life.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.560
I'm hungry.
I can't deal with this right now.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.560
All right, brother. Okay.

59:26.640 --> 59:31.360
The Lord will be with you. Thank-you.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:48.280
Huh. What kind of nonsense is this?

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.080
You're so beautiful.

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:02.560
Hey, sweetie. Will you show me?

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.000
So pretty. You all right?

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:09.360
Then why so quiet?

1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:14.200
Are you afraid of me?

1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:20.000
A prostitute who doesn't like
to be touched?

1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:24.440
I called you what you are.
What did you come here for?

1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:27.680
Nothing is going to happen here today.

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:29.360
Hey, then what are we doing here?

1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:25.360
Hi, guys.

1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:07.480
Your thighs are so white,
it's like they're made of snow.

1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:16.800
-Slow down.
-What's the matter?

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.280
She's never done this before,
she's nervous.

1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:19.920
Can I get you champagne?

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.360
‎Cool, friend.

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:28.760
Just give me one kiss.
Or do you want cash up front?

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:02.560
I know.

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.200
‎I'm sorry, friend.

1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:24.560
That rubbish.

1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:36.880
Hey, catch him!

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:39.680
Hey, you.

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:42.280
Why are you looking at me strangely?

1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:45.360
Because you do strange things.

1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:46.680
At your age.

1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:56.800
What's so funny?

1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:03.240
Do you realize
how much younger he is than you?

1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:08.720
And not grannies like you.

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:11.120
What's so sexy about you, tomboy?

1:16:11.720 --> 1:16:13.240
Whatever.

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:21.280
Listen to me. Firstly,

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:24.840
I don't sleep with young boys.

1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.440
That boy is not by Ben10.

1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:30.560
He's my nephew.

1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:38.520
Really, ma'am?

1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:43.120
Sorry.

1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:50.160
He really did her wrong.

1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:51.600
And now she's depressed, ma'am.

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:53.240
‎What did he do to her?

1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:03.760
Like I mentioned, ma'am,

1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:15.720
Why does she allow men to sleep with her?

1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:22.640
Ah. Disaster. From that dog? Good luck.

1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:27.640
But I don't understand.
How does he accomplish all that

1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:31.080
while he's living
under his brother's roof?

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:32.520
Really?

1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:37.720
Listen to me.

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:40.320
That boy is a good-for-nothing.

1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:42.840
‎That parasite is jobless and broke.

1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:53.160
Girls who are like that, like your friend,

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:56.680
‎who believe that house belongs to him.

1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:00.800
He is broke, he has nothing.

1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:06.240
Now I know why he was acting

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:09.200
‎so weirdly at the restaurant.

1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:13.600
-Was that in Midrand?
-Yes.

1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:18.080
Yes, that sounds just like him.

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:19.720
That guy…

1:18:25.880 --> 1:18:26.960
How can I help?

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:31.880
Tell me, how can I help?

1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:33.920
I'm glad you asked, ma'am.

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.840
‎I have a plan. I'll tell you.

1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:40.480
Listen to her.

1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:44.600
Don't keep suffering. Men will be selfish.

1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:13.640
Oga, this is a big one.

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:19.520
Oh. How did it go with you?

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.600
I'm from deep rural Nquthu.

1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:31.760
Not like that.

1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:44.600
I was the one
who changed Richard's diapers.

1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:49.760
Up until the age of twelve,
he used to wet his pants.

1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:53.760
-Whoo.
-You know…

1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:56.120
‎I cleaned his underpants.

1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:58.880
Tiny pee-pee, but massive testicles.

1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:04.880
Traditional healers couldn't
give him medicine to make it grow.

1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:07.520
Nothing.

1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:09.080
I took him to Venda,

1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:11.720
where there's a tree with growth potion.

1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:13.040
‎But still nothing.

1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:15.320
You should have seen him,

1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:21.120
sticking it into every tree he could find.

1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:29.040
Hey, mama. Go on. Go on.

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:32.440
He owns nothing. No bike, no house.

1:29:32.520 --> 1:29:36.800
It's all a figment of his imagination.

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:41.040
Yes. And cut.

1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:43.160
Thank-you, ma'am.
