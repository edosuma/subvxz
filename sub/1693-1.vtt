To those beautiful,
ignorant bastards.

00:09.745 --> 00:10.711
( cheers )

00:10.746 --> 00:12.447
You're placing Enoch Thompson

00:12.482 --> 00:15.718
<i>at the head of a criminal organization
controlling Atlantic county.</i>

00:15.752 --> 00:18.989
Torrio: <i>Arnold Rothstein</i>
<i>and Charlie Luciano.</i>

00:19.023 --> 00:21.525
I have a load coming in tomorrow.
500 crates Canadian Club.

00:21.559 --> 00:23.560
You use your own
men for the pickup.

00:23.595 --> 00:25.797
- Jimmy Darmody.
- Al Capone.

00:25.832 --> 00:27.733
- Drop your weapon.
- Get 'em up.

00:29.336 --> 00:31.837
Jimmy left me holding the bag.

00:31.872 --> 00:33.706
Is this the way
you do business?

00:33.741 --> 00:37.378
My husband, he has a
weakness for the dice games.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.846
This should see you
through winter.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.981
Give me that money.
( screams )

00:41.016 --> 00:43.585
I'm investigating Saturday
night's shootings.

00:43.619 --> 00:45.186
We can all rest
now that the architect

00:45.220 --> 00:47.322
<i>of that slaughter has been</i>
<i>killed himself.</i>

00:47.356 --> 00:49.090
You're out, Mickey.
Out of the business.

00:49.124 --> 00:50.692
<i>Chalky White's taking over.</i>

00:50.726 --> 00:52.226
What am I supposed
to tell my partners?

00:52.261 --> 00:54.962
- He drives a packard you said.
- <i>But it wasn't Chalky.</i>

00:54.997 --> 00:56.230
<i>You hung a fella
<i>that works for him.</i></i>

00:56.265 --> 00:58.132
Let's go.
You're under arrest.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.167
These here are my daddy tools.

01:00.202 --> 01:02.905
- <i>What are you gonna do with them?</i>
 - It wasn't the klan.

01:02.939 --> 01:05.541
The roads to Atlantic City
are rivers of mud.

01:05.576 --> 01:08.177
We need paved highways
so cars can come and go.

01:08.212 --> 01:11.549
- Mrs. Schroeder is here.
- Who's Mrs. Schroeder?

01:16.522 --> 01:17.922
Don't move!

01:19.825 --> 01:22.461
- You're sure these are the guys
who held you up? - Absolutely.

01:22.495 --> 01:26.399
D'Alessio brothers. They're being
backed by Rothstein and Luciano.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.968
They shot my brother, Mickey.
They shot at me.

01:29.937 --> 01:31.705
You are consorting with the man

01:31.739 --> 01:34.174
who killed the father
of your children.

01:34.209 --> 01:35.743
Run somebody else for mayor.

01:35.778 --> 01:38.146
- Nucky: <i>What do I do about Eli?</i>
- Replace him too.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.183
I'm dying. There's no
time to be sentimental.

01:41.217 --> 01:43.085
Accept Jesus as your savior.

01:46.090 --> 01:49.693
This morning I found this
hidden in his rubbish pail.

01:49.728 --> 01:50.995
You gonna arrest
her or not, sheriff?

01:51.029 --> 01:53.030
He's not.
Go far away.

01:53.065 --> 01:56.300
- What's your name, handsome?
- Nelson.

01:57.936 --> 02:00.472
You know I'm about to be indicted
for fixing the world series.

02:00.506 --> 02:03.642
I need a man with your political
reach to quash the indictment.

02:03.676 --> 02:06.545
- That could be arranged.
- <i>In exchange for what?</i>

02:09.348 --> 02:12.851
The times with you
and the children,

02:12.885 --> 02:14.787
<i>I've never been happier.</i>

02:14.821 --> 02:16.488
You made me pregnant.

02:17.857 --> 02:19.792
- You have to trust me, Eli.
- What does that mean?

02:19.826 --> 02:21.794
That blood is thicker than water.

02:21.828 --> 02:24.564
- Commodore: <i>You're my </i>
<i>flesh and blood, boy.</i> - So?

02:24.598 --> 02:26.833
So you're gonna take
back Atlantic City

02:26.867 --> 02:28.968
for the both of us.

08:37.102 --> 08:40.472
No!

08:40.506 --> 08:43.107
- You're home.
- Be it ever so humble.

08:44.377 --> 08:46.244
What's the problem?
Why is he under there?

08:46.278 --> 08:49.514
He doesn't want
to go to school.

08:51.049 --> 08:52.984
You want to grow up
to be a fishmonger?

08:53.018 --> 08:56.420
- Yes!
- No, you don't.

08:56.455 --> 08:59.490
You want to be a doctor
or something, remember?

08:59.524 --> 09:02.727
- Like Dr. Surran.
- Sister Bernice--

09:02.761 --> 09:06.530
He was misbehaving apparently
and she took the ruler to him.

09:06.565 --> 09:08.566
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.103
- Well, nuns don't just go around
hitting people.- She pulled my hair.

09:12.138 --> 09:16.274
A nun hit me when I was your age, I'd
get another whipping from my dad.

09:20.078 --> 09:22.313
Go with Katy, dear.
Wash up.

09:22.347 --> 09:25.016
- You too.
- This way, sweethearts.

09:25.050 --> 09:27.451
Come on.

09:30.255 --> 09:32.923
It's nearly 8:00 a.m.

09:32.958 --> 09:35.259
Considering the night I had,

09:35.294 --> 09:37.629
I'm amazed I'm home before 9:00.

09:37.663 --> 09:40.232
I'm sure.

09:46.274 --> 09:49.142
But you do look ravishing.

09:49.177 --> 09:53.014

10:02.224 --> 10:04.459
Teddy: <i>I'm not going!</i>
 <i>I told you.</i>

10:04.493 --> 10:08.929
- Where are you going?
- To the office to get some sleep.

10:08.964 --> 10:11.665
- Katy: <i>Do you want your mommy upset?</i>
- Teddy: <i>No, I told you!</i>

- Teddy!

<i>( gulls cawing )</i>

10:37.160 --> 10:39.328

the chicken laugh.

10:41.598 --> 10:44.833

- Hey, pal.

10:44.868 --> 10:47.002

- Nucky called?

10:53.476 --> 10:55.076
Was he supposed to?

10:58.247 --> 11:00.215
I'll take some ham
and some eggs.

11:01.884 --> 11:04.686
Oh, well, I know how
he likes them, dear.

11:17.201 --> 11:19.269
- You want to go shoot some gulls?
- Yeah.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.438
- Jimmy.
- What?

11:23.040 --> 11:25.841
- He's too young.
- No, I'm not.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.711
 I was his age, I used
to go all the time.

11:27.711 --> 11:29.111
Younger, with your father.

11:29.445 --> 11:32.047
Actually it was with Nucky mostly.

11:32.081 --> 11:35.383
- I don't think it's safe.
- Tommy: <i>Please!</i>

11:35.418 --> 11:38.319
- Please please.
- Jimmy: Come on.

11:38.353 --> 11:40.754
He's a big boy.
Relax, Ange.

11:40.788 --> 11:42.890
You worry too much.

11:46.594 --> 11:49.096
- Tommy: <i>Please!</i>
- Make sure he dresses warmly.

11:49.130 --> 11:51.331
- All right, come on, let's go.
- Your plaid pants.

11:51.366 --> 11:52.900
- Got it.
- You got it?

11:54.602 --> 11:56.903
And be careful.

11:56.938 --> 12:00.441
Are we gonna shoot some real
seagulls with real guns?

12:00.475 --> 12:02.443
Yes, we are.

12:06.282 --> 12:08.984
- I really wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what, dear?

12:09.018 --> 12:11.921
- Undercut me.
- Oh, sweetie,

12:11.955 --> 12:14.757
I would never.
You're his wife.

12:14.791 --> 12:17.160
Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother.

12:18.062 --> 12:19.429
( faintly ) No problem.

12:19.463 --> 12:21.698
I was only trying to help, dear--

12:21.732 --> 12:24.634
as your husband's mother.

12:24.668 --> 12:27.303
Boys will be boys, after all.

12:31.407 --> 12:34.209
You know, when Jimmy was a baby

12:34.243 --> 12:36.911
and I would change his diaper...

12:38.380 --> 12:41.549
I used to kiss
his little winkie.

12:50.193 --> 12:52.328
( men grunting )

13:01.405 --> 13:03.772
What is the meaning of this?!

13:03.807 --> 13:06.008
Move this furniture
back into place!

13:06.042 --> 13:08.143
Sir, we weren't expecting you, sir.

13:12.115 --> 13:15.216
Mrs. Van Alden wanted
to see the office.

13:15.251 --> 13:18.753
The field reports, we were
just about to hop to it.

13:18.787 --> 13:21.689
I take almost no comfort
in "about to," agent Clarkson.

13:21.723 --> 13:23.357
- Yes sir.
- Van Alden: Gentlemen,

13:23.392 --> 13:26.127
I'd like to introduce my wife.

13:26.161 --> 13:29.496
Dear, these are agents
Sawicki and Clarkson.

13:29.531 --> 13:31.098
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

13:31.100 --> 13:33.366
Agent Sawicki
is of polish stock.

13:33.401 --> 13:35.402
He joins us  from Mt. Olivet.

13:35.436 --> 13:36.640
Outside Pittsburgh.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.340
 Yes, they have a large
Christian community.

13:43.143 --> 13:45.711
Mrs. Van Alden is
visiting for the weekend.

13:45.746 --> 13:50.416
Well, there's no shortage
of wholesome entertainment.

13:50.450 --> 13:53.952
I picked up this tourist guide

13:53.987 --> 13:55.887
Yesterday.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.090
Oh.

13:58.124 --> 14:01.292
- Does it list the churches?
- Clarkson: <i>I assume so.</i>

14:01.327 --> 14:04.363
- I haven't read it yet.
- Oh.

14:04.397 --> 14:05.764
Consider it a gift.

14:05.799 --> 14:07.700
Thank you.

14:07.734 --> 14:10.870
If I'm needed, we're staying
at the hotel Metropole.

14:10.904 --> 14:15.375
Though I anticipate we'll be out
mostly, taking in the sights.

14:21.684 --> 14:24.552
Save the roughhouse
for your own time,

14:24.586 --> 14:26.220
gentlemen.

14:26.255 --> 14:28.289
Both:
Yes sir.

14:29.458 --> 14:32.226
<i>( music playing )</i>

14:39.035 --> 14:41.269
( giggling, chatting )

14:43.606 --> 14:46.341
Man: That's a fine
how-do-you-do.

14:46.376 --> 14:49.612
Woman: It's so hot. I could just
come down on the weekend.

14:51.715 --> 14:55.252
- It's just gonna be another minute.
- What's hurting him now?

14:55.286 --> 14:57.187
He's got an earache.

14:57.221 --> 15:00.758
Mr. Torrio's a man beset
by convenient maladies.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.460
- What's that mean?
- Nothing cures him faster

15:03.494 --> 15:05.562
than someone else
doing his laundry.

15:05.596 --> 15:08.131
I ain't his washerwoman.

15:08.165 --> 15:10.666
( chuckles ) Don't take
it personally, kid.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.269
What do you think George Remus
spent five years doing?

15:13.303 --> 15:15.670
- Come again?
- I said what do you think

15:15.705 --> 15:17.939
George Remus was doing for him?

15:17.974 --> 15:20.442
Ain't you George Remus?

15:20.476 --> 15:21.947
Who'd you think I was?

15:22.047 --> 15:24.647
You just said it like
it was someone else.

15:27.150 --> 15:28.651
Torrio: This shyster--

15:28.685 --> 15:32.622
had him on a $500 retainer,
keep me out of the hoosegow.

15:32.657 --> 15:35.726
Cheaper lawyer,
more time in jail.

15:36.795 --> 15:38.630
Why the fuck you
move to Cincinnati?

15:38.664 --> 15:40.932
Well, John,

15:40.967 --> 15:45.369
draw a circle 300 miles
around, know what you get?

15:45.404 --> 15:48.172
- 300 miles of cowshit.
- ( laughter )

15:48.206 --> 15:51.175
And 80% of the bonded whiskey
being stored in this country.

15:51.209 --> 15:55.512
- How much's in your pocket?
- Enough to float your speaks,

15:55.546 --> 15:57.881
plus a whole lot more.

16:02.586 --> 16:06.023
We're looking to keep business
steady-- no heartburn,

16:06.057 --> 16:07.494
No blood on the floor.

16:07.495 --> 16:09.627
Buy from George Remus,
there won't be any.

16:09.828 --> 16:14.365
Remus owns the distilleries and the
pharmacies they're allowed to sell to.

16:14.399 --> 16:17.134
Even better, Remus
owns the trucks

16:17.169 --> 16:19.603
that hijack his own liquor.

16:19.638 --> 16:22.740
- That's a neat trick.
- No trick, my boy.

16:22.774 --> 16:26.978
Remus read the Volstead
Act very closely.

16:27.012 --> 16:29.347
We oughta be
in business with him.

16:29.382 --> 16:32.117
The fuck you talking about?
<i>He's</i> Remus.

16:32.152 --> 16:33.853
I know.
I'm just--

16:33.887 --> 16:37.256
- 4,000 cases a month.
- You're good for eight easy.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.825
Let's see how it goes.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.628
Buying from Canada, john?
Makes sense.

16:42.663 --> 16:45.397
But you never know what
can happen on that lake.

16:45.432 --> 16:49.869
As for Atlantic City,
Cincinnati's a lot closer.

16:51.438 --> 16:54.039
And who really likes
Nucky Thompson anyway?

16:54.074 --> 16:56.942
I take it Remus doesn't.

16:56.976 --> 16:59.411
A man lays out two grand
for a weekend on the shore,

16:59.446 --> 17:02.381
he doesn't expect an altercation
over the telephone bill.

17:02.416 --> 17:05.084
Well, it's all on the
house here, Georgie.

17:05.118 --> 17:07.253
Go say hello to Odette.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.324
( moans )

17:11.358 --> 17:14.094
We'll work out
the details later.

17:21.868 --> 17:23.536
Hi.

17:24.939 --> 17:27.773
- When you go to Atlantic City--
- when am I doing that?

17:27.808 --> 17:30.110
Next month, before you
head to Brooklyn.

17:30.144 --> 17:32.246
Johnny, I got this
thing for my father.

17:32.247 --> 17:33.680
So leave a day early.

17:33.681 --> 17:36.748
Go see Nucky, tell him
things have changed.

17:36.783 --> 17:38.517
That's it?

17:38.551 --> 17:40.686
You'll think of something.

17:42.389 --> 17:44.790
Yeah, your fucking laundry.

17:48.661 --> 17:51.130
<i>Straight through Gloucester county,</i>
<i>all you can get. </i>

17:51.164 --> 17:52.932
Me and the boys here
are gobbling it all up.

17:52.967 --> 17:55.702
- It's pennies an acre.
- ( irish accent ) Because it's worthless land.

17:55.736 --> 17:58.105
- Not for long. - The road
appropriations come through,

17:58.139 --> 18:00.641
we steer the planning commissioners
right where we want them.

18:00.676 --> 18:01.978
With the old golden handshake?

18:02.079 --> 18:03.911
- Well, how does anything
get done, Ernie?

18:04.112 --> 18:07.948
Once that's settled, we sell the land
back to the great state of New Jersey.

18:07.982 --> 18:11.751
- At a tenfold profit.
- So how does a fella get a piece?

18:11.786 --> 18:14.420
- Quickly, my boy, quickly.
- The blue plots are all taken.

18:14.455 --> 18:16.656
<i>Jesus, you fellas</i>
<i>own all that?</i>

18:16.690 --> 18:19.358
- Not all, but most.
- ( all chuckle )

18:19.392 --> 18:20.959
Land barons of barren land.

18:20.993 --> 18:22.627
And it gets even better.

18:22.662 --> 18:24.696
Once the roads are approved, they're
gonna need to be built, right?

18:24.730 --> 18:28.032
It just so happens I have a very close
friend in the construction business.

18:28.067 --> 18:29.901
Edward Bader, master builder.

18:29.935 --> 18:31.936
Yeah, with his own two hands.
( laughs )

18:31.970 --> 18:34.105
And you, my friend,
are hereby notified

18:34.139 --> 18:37.074
we are currently accepting
bids to supply the gravel.

18:37.109 --> 18:40.077
- For 40 miles of road?
- You can do the math yourself.

18:40.112 --> 18:43.280
I will.
But in the meantime,

18:43.315 --> 18:45.849
let this pave the way
in my direction.

18:45.884 --> 18:48.752
Well, it's a fine start.

18:48.786 --> 18:50.720
Perfect, Ernie.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.723
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house Monday night.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.859
- You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.
- Always happy to help.

19:28.561 --> 19:31.563
Nucky, we have an emergency.

19:31.597 --> 19:35.733
There's a reporter calling. He claims
Chalky White has shot a klansman.

19:37.035 --> 19:39.402
- Get my brother--
- I have already called him.

19:44.409 --> 19:46.577
Barker: <i>Right here on the</i>
<i>Atlantic City boardwalk,</i>

19:46.611 --> 19:49.646
- <i>for over 40 years...</i>
- Boy: <i>Five more minutes?</i>

19:52.216 --> 19:55.452
They have a hotel
shaped like an elephant.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.754
It's in Margate-- six stories.

19:57.788 --> 19:59.790
It's quite something.

20:03.027 --> 20:06.029
The tusks are genuine
ivory apparently.

20:06.063 --> 20:08.231
Beg your pardon?

20:08.266 --> 20:10.400
The elephant.
We can take a drive.

20:10.435 --> 20:13.570
Oh no.
Thank you.

20:22.047 --> 20:24.081
Who was that?

20:24.115 --> 20:26.984
No one of any consequence.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.223
If you're hungry,
there's a soda fountain.

20:32.257 --> 20:35.126
They sell potato cakes
called kor-nishes.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.762
- ( gasps )
- What's wrong?

20:37.797 --> 20:39.964
This guide--

20:39.999 --> 20:43.501
It lists the taverns,
the houses of ill-repute.

20:43.535 --> 20:47.972
- "If Jesus came to Atlantic City..."
- The places he <i>wouldn't</i> go.

20:49.408 --> 20:52.444
The author's attempt
at cynicism.

20:52.478 --> 20:56.214
I'm sorry you had
to see that, dear.

20:58.318 --> 21:02.187
Maybe it's better
we don't have children.

21:04.256 --> 21:07.058
This world, Nelson.

21:07.092 --> 21:09.861
<i>( piano playing )</i>

21:33.553 --> 21:35.988
Are you sure I can't offer
you gentlemen luncheon?

21:36.022 --> 21:38.391
Oh, thank you, Lenore, no.

21:48.136 --> 21:50.971
We need some privacy, dear.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.106
Lester baby?

21:57.946 --> 22:00.380
- It's very nice, Lester.
- Talented.

22:00.414 --> 22:03.650
- Thank you, sir. - Lester will be
attending Morehouse in two years.

22:03.684 --> 22:06.086
The college.

22:20.001 --> 22:22.903
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck happened?

22:22.937 --> 22:25.139
It don't matter now, does it?

22:25.173 --> 22:27.241
I took care of it my own self.

22:27.276 --> 22:28.844
You shot a white man
in the throat.

22:28.878 --> 22:31.479
Which I had to hear about
from some fucking reporter.

22:31.514 --> 22:34.716
Hermanacus, he's a schoolteacher.
The other one lost his arm.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.685
I've got four boys dead
in that warehouse.

22:37.753 --> 22:41.421
Half a dozen wounded--
including a woman.

22:41.456 --> 22:44.058
- You know I'll take care of it.
- How I know that?

22:44.092 --> 22:47.028
We're supposed to be
protected from these ofays.

22:47.063 --> 22:49.765
- Look, I can't control--
- No, you look!

22:51.334 --> 22:54.003
I'm done with this <i>shit.</i>

22:54.038 --> 22:57.340
- Just like that, huh?
- I got my family

22:57.374 --> 22:59.376
and I got my people.

22:59.410 --> 23:00.944
Your people?

23:02.313 --> 23:06.583
The 10,000 black folk
who make this city hum.

23:06.617 --> 23:10.453
Busboys, trash collectors, porters.

23:10.487 --> 23:12.255
Meaning what exactly?

23:12.289 --> 23:14.991
Meaning...

23:15.025 --> 23:18.594
you go school these crackers,

23:18.628 --> 23:21.297
Lest you all find out.

23:22.566 --> 23:24.300
You do understand

23:24.334 --> 23:27.436
I'm the only thing keeping
you from a lynch mob?

23:29.839 --> 23:31.774
Are you ready

23:31.808 --> 23:35.010
for what happens here

23:35.045 --> 23:38.148
I turn up on the end of a rope?

23:38.182 --> 23:39.883
Nucky:
<i>Things go that way,</i>

23:39.917 --> 23:43.620
your people have a lot
more to lose than I do.

23:52.263 --> 23:55.365
You gonna arrest me or not?

23:59.905 --> 24:02.406
I can handle this for now.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.542
Stay in the fucking house.

24:06.478 --> 24:09.479
You can see yourselves out.

24:18.889 --> 24:23.592
This klan shit, Eli, I thought
you had it under control.

24:36.437 --> 24:39.540
That is one uppity shine.

24:45.981 --> 24:48.349
Sister Bernice?

24:48.383 --> 24:51.953
I'm Margaret Schroeder,
Teddy's mother.

24:53.022 --> 24:55.156
I stopped by the convent.

24:55.191 --> 24:57.359
They told me
I could find you here.

24:57.393 --> 25:00.429
Much quieter this time of day.

25:02.165 --> 25:04.433
Ben Franklin...

25:04.468 --> 25:06.969
Apparently
he discovered lightning.

25:08.906 --> 25:12.009
- Have a seat.
- Thank you no.

25:12.043 --> 25:15.345
- My son.
- Mm-hmm.

25:15.379 --> 25:17.414
He came home yesterday
with bruises.

25:17.448 --> 25:19.349
Where I struck him
with a ruler.

25:19.383 --> 25:22.686
Did he tell you why
he was punished?

25:22.720 --> 25:26.656
No, not specifically.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.258
What did he tell you?

25:28.292 --> 25:30.427
That he did nothing wrong.

25:30.461 --> 25:33.597
Then you're raising
a liar, Mrs. Schroeder.

25:39.004 --> 25:42.406
He was playing with matches...

25:43.408 --> 25:45.109
in a coat closet

25:45.144 --> 25:49.080
in a school full of children.

25:51.783 --> 25:56.119
I-- I don't know what to say.

25:56.154 --> 25:57.921
You're a widow,

25:57.955 --> 25:59.923
Is that right?

26:02.793 --> 26:06.296
- I am. - And you live
with Teddy's uncle?

26:09.667 --> 26:12.636
Is my son to be expelled?

26:12.671 --> 26:14.839
No.

26:14.873 --> 26:17.676
Father Brennan intervened.

26:18.711 --> 26:21.347
Apparently he's close

26:21.381 --> 26:24.650
with your Mr. Thompson.

26:26.186 --> 26:28.353
Thank you for seeing me.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.795
Eli: We agreed we were gonna put
him out of business, but this--

26:36.830 --> 26:38.631
it's fucking madness.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.633
They had to shoot a woman?

26:40.667 --> 26:44.069
Did you mollycoddle the
enemy in France, Jimmy?

26:44.104 --> 26:47.706
He cut off a man's finger.
They were champing at a bit.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.141
10,000 coloreds up in arms now.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.910
The klan boys are in our corner.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.013
There's a lot more
than 10,000 of them.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.948
What am I supposed
to tell Nucky?

26:57.982 --> 27:00.551
Nucky Thompson was
weaned on my teat!

27:00.585 --> 27:03.487
I know him backwards and forwards.

27:04.890 --> 27:08.159
Governor Edwards, he hates
the bastard more than I do.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.061
They're ready,
him and his people?

27:10.095 --> 27:11.963
Will you stop worrying,
for god's sake?

27:11.998 --> 27:15.200
-  I need to know what's going on, Lou!
- The less you know the better.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.936
Well, that's just peachy, isn't it?

27:16.970 --> 27:20.339
Worry about yourself, Eli.
I'll handle Nucky.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.382
I gotta go.

27:48.467 --> 27:48.532
Commodore:
<i>Some men, I'll tell you.</i>

27:50.569 --> 27:53.038
You give 'em a badge and a gun,

27:53.072 --> 27:55.340
a county treasurership,

27:55.375 --> 27:57.676
they think they have power.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.911
Soon

27:59.946 --> 28:01.646
you'll see what real power is.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.049
- How soon? - <i>I want you to start</i>
<i>laying some groundwork--</i>

28:05.084 --> 28:09.220
Meet the governor,
cultivate relationships;

28:09.254 --> 28:12.256
New York, Philly;
alcohol's the key.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.291
What about here?

28:14.326 --> 28:17.494
Chalky's out of the game,
that's a pretty good start.

28:17.529 --> 28:22.399
Got that whole warehouse
that's there for the taking.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.839
<i>Jimmy.</i>

28:27.873 --> 28:30.843
Don't worry about Nucky.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.979
I'm not.

28:33.013 --> 28:35.815
Hmm.

28:35.849 --> 28:37.684
Look around, boy.

28:37.718 --> 28:40.954
These animals?
Beasts.

28:40.989 --> 28:43.857
<i>Any one of 'em could've</i>
<i>torn me to pieces.</i>

28:43.892 --> 28:46.460
<i>But they didn't.</i>

28:47.395 --> 28:50.831
This fucker, he was a giant.

28:50.866 --> 28:54.768
<i>600lbs,</i>
<i>over seven feet tall.</i>

28:54.802 --> 28:57.737
I tracked him for three hours.

28:57.771 --> 29:01.574
Finally cornered him in a ravine.

29:01.608 --> 29:04.744
He smelled me,

29:04.779 --> 29:07.747
<i>started comin' closer.</i>

29:07.781 --> 29:10.249
The son of a bitch got confident,

29:10.284 --> 29:12.085
thought I was scared.

29:12.119 --> 29:15.022
<i>Reared up on me,</i>
<i>puffed up his chest</i>

29:15.056 --> 29:17.558
<i>and let out a roar.</i>

29:17.592 --> 29:20.995
<i>I blasted him</i>
<i>right in the gut.</i>

29:21.029 --> 29:24.065
Bled out, looking up at me

29:24.099 --> 29:26.000
right in the eyes,

29:26.035 --> 29:29.537
<i>almost like</i>
<i>he couldn't believe it.</i>

29:33.643 --> 29:37.045
You'll be judged by what
you succeed at, boy,

29:37.080 --> 29:39.648
not by what you attempt.

29:40.917 --> 29:43.519
Nucky: <i>Last night,</i>
<i>four fine young boys</i>

29:43.554 --> 29:46.990
were murdered by men
claiming to represent

29:47.024 --> 29:49.759
the race of white
American Christians.

29:49.794 --> 29:51.594
Woman:
Christians?!

29:51.629 --> 29:53.165
I will not speak the name of that so-called

29:53.166 --> 29:55.299
organization within this house of god.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.102
- Congregation: <i>That's right.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i> - Amen.

29:58.136 --> 30:00.671
But I can assure you,

30:00.706 --> 30:03.174
as treasurer of Atlantic county,

30:03.208 --> 30:06.744
and more personally as someone
who has always regarded

30:06.778 --> 30:10.047
the members of our
colored community

30:10.081 --> 30:13.383
as his friends and equals,

30:13.418 --> 30:17.520
that neither I, sheriff
Thompson, or any of his men

30:17.554 --> 30:20.056
will rest until these
hooded cowards

30:20.090 --> 30:23.158
are brought to justice,

30:23.193 --> 30:26.595
and the message is sent
loud and clear...

30:26.629 --> 30:29.265
that no one need fear

30:29.299 --> 30:32.902
For their safety, or the safety
of their wives, children,

30:32.936 --> 30:36.972
or property in the face
of the obstreperous negro.

30:37.007 --> 30:38.640
- Man #1: That's right.
- Man #2: Yes sir.

30:38.675 --> 30:40.843
These coloreds need
to learn a lesson,

30:40.877 --> 30:43.512
and we are going to teach it

30:43.547 --> 30:46.816
with, dare I say
in these sacred confines,

30:46.851 --> 30:50.220
an iron fist?

30:54.192 --> 30:56.727
I just come from St. Mark's!

30:56.762 --> 30:59.964
Herman Dacus just died
from his neck wound.

30:59.999 --> 31:01.766
- ( murmuring )
- It happened.

31:03.435 --> 31:04.969
Eli, find Chalky

31:05.003 --> 31:07.004
and place him under arrest--

31:07.039 --> 31:08.772
for his own safety.

31:12.610 --> 31:14.711
Friends, please please.

31:14.746 --> 31:17.480
Remain calm!

31:20.284 --> 31:22.952
- Good afternoon, welcome to preston's.
- How do you do?

31:22.987 --> 31:24.888
Are we celebrating
a special occasion?

31:24.922 --> 31:27.625
Our 13th wedding anniversary.

31:27.659 --> 31:30.395
Well, that's lucky.

31:30.429 --> 31:32.831
How so?

31:32.865 --> 31:35.100
Lucky 13.

31:36.602 --> 31:38.603
Are we ready to order?

31:38.638 --> 31:40.839
The lady will have
the mutton chops.

31:40.873 --> 31:44.243
- <i>And for the gentlemen?</i>
- Steak.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.978
Turtle soup to start.

31:46.012 --> 31:48.480
And will we be imbibing, sir?

31:48.514 --> 31:50.515
I beg your pardon?

31:50.549 --> 31:53.352
Something to drink perhaps?
For the occasion.

31:53.386 --> 31:56.889
We can accommodate
most requests.

31:58.693 --> 32:00.994
The lady will have coffee.

32:01.029 --> 32:04.397
I'll have a glass
of cold buttermilk.

32:06.100 --> 32:08.035
Ma'am.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.475
Nelson, he was
offering alcohol.

32:14.509 --> 32:17.846
- I realize that, dear. - Well, aren't
you going to arrest him?

32:20.516 --> 32:23.451
- We're here to eat dinner.
- Of course...

32:29.891 --> 32:31.591
But...

32:34.028 --> 32:36.062
Pardon me, dear.
I need to wash up--

32:36.096 --> 32:37.996
Public spaces.

32:51.411 --> 32:53.980
Woman: <i>Yes, she told me.</i>
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

32:54.014 --> 32:57.885
I'm so sorry.
It was just so awful.
I'm so sorry.

32:57.919 --> 33:00.721
Thank you.
I'm so glad you came here.

33:00.755 --> 33:04.057
Mrs. Dacus, I am so
sorry for your loss.

33:04.091 --> 33:06.159
Thank you, Nucky.

33:09.663 --> 33:12.399
He was a pillar of the community
and will be sorely missed.

33:12.433 --> 33:14.367
Thank you, Nucky.
Thank you.

33:18.071 --> 33:20.206
Would you excuse us?

33:22.042 --> 33:24.343
What are you doing here?

33:24.377 --> 33:27.646
I came to pay my respects.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.181
Politics is my department.

33:29.215 --> 33:32.117
He was one of my
high school teachers.

33:32.151 --> 33:33.818
So?

33:33.853 --> 33:36.521
- So what?
- Yesterday morning

33:36.555 --> 33:40.492
- At Chalky's. - I was gone.
It happened after we left.

33:40.526 --> 33:42.927
You saw nothing that
aroused your suspicion?

33:44.463 --> 33:46.631
Let me go do this.

34:16.194 --> 34:18.929
It's an awful waste of a
lot of good tablecloths.

34:18.963 --> 34:21.697
The laundry bills alone.

34:29.574 --> 34:33.512
- So how's Chalky?
- Alive,

34:33.545 --> 34:35.681
which is the main thing.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.958
So you run off and get married
like a thief in the night?

34:45.993 --> 34:48.962
- You sound like my mother.
- What happened?

34:48.996 --> 34:52.199
You used to ask
my advice on things.

34:52.234 --> 34:55.103
My own kid is practically
shaving, Nuck.

34:56.205 --> 34:58.272
He like the new place?

35:00.408 --> 35:02.844
I took him shooting.

35:02.878 --> 35:04.946
Fishing too.

35:04.980 --> 35:06.848
Oyster creek,

35:06.882 --> 35:10.252
- like we used to.
- When I was sheriff.

35:12.055 --> 35:14.156
I used to love that.

35:15.459 --> 35:18.895
Standing there for hours,
not saying a word.

35:18.930 --> 35:22.967
Is there anything now?

35:25.203 --> 35:27.405
That you want to say?

35:30.575 --> 35:32.777
What do you mean?

35:32.811 --> 35:36.047
Your father is a
very duplicitous man.

35:39.685 --> 35:41.952
You've been told.

35:46.324 --> 35:49.326
I told my mother
I'd be over for dinner.

36:15.887 --> 36:18.322
Would you care for some
butterscotch pudding?

36:18.356 --> 36:21.425
I'm afraid I'm too full.

36:24.496 --> 36:27.832
- I got you something.
- Nelson.

36:27.867 --> 36:30.001
I thought you didn't
believe in gifts.

36:30.036 --> 36:32.738
I saw it and I thought of you.

36:44.551 --> 36:46.919
Oh, it's lovely.

36:48.988 --> 36:51.289
Thank you.

36:55.927 --> 36:58.228
- Sir?
- How may I help you?

36:58.263 --> 37:00.965
You mentioned earlier

37:00.999 --> 37:03.334
about this being
a special occasion.

37:03.368 --> 37:06.304
Indeed.

37:07.472 --> 37:10.841
Have you any champagne?
Whiskey perhaps?

37:10.875 --> 37:13.177
- We do, sir.
- <i>Nelson!</i>

37:13.211 --> 37:16.147
It's all right, dear.

37:20.519 --> 37:23.788
Everybody stay seated.
This is a raid!

37:23.822 --> 37:26.892
All staff members
kneel on the floor,

37:26.893 --> 37:28.826
hands interlocked
atop your heads.

37:28.927 --> 37:30.861
- Agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir?

37:30.895 --> 37:32.763
Van alden: <i>Secure the contents</i>
<i>of the cash drawer.</i>

37:32.797 --> 37:34.898
<i>I want the money</i>
<i>counted and documented</i>

37:34.932 --> 37:37.000
<i>with an official</i>
<i>forfeiture receipt.</i>

37:37.034 --> 37:39.902
Agent Sawicki,
break down that door.

37:39.936 --> 37:41.771
Woman: Oh my god.

37:47.912 --> 37:50.613
Van Alden: <i>This establishment is</i>
 <i>being shuttered</i>

37:50.647 --> 37:52.916
<i>for violation</i>
<i>of the Volstead Act.</i>

37:52.950 --> 37:55.686
It is loaded, sir.
There is over 200 cases

37:55.720 --> 37:57.721
of brandy, wine and champagne.

37:57.755 --> 38:00.190
Tag it, catalog it
and destroy it.

38:01.793 --> 38:03.960
- What's your name?
- Carl Switzer.

38:03.995 --> 38:06.196
Mr. Switzer, you are
hereby under arrest

38:06.231 --> 38:08.832
for violation of the Volstead Act.
Agent Sawicki?

38:21.546 --> 38:24.114
<i>( thumping, squeaking )</i>

38:30.888 --> 38:33.656
Right here, this section.

38:33.690 --> 38:35.324
The springs are broken.

38:35.358 --> 38:37.526
- No wonder you're not sleeping.
- Mmm.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.629
We could go to your rooming house.

38:40.663 --> 38:43.131
Men only, dear.

38:43.165 --> 38:46.601
I'm afraid it's not
nearly as luxurious.

38:52.607 --> 38:55.475
- I'm very proud of you, Nelson.
- Hmm.

38:55.509 --> 38:58.144
The way you handled those men.

38:58.178 --> 38:59.978
( nervous chuckle )

39:00.013 --> 39:02.480
It's what I'm paid for, dear.

39:04.350 --> 39:06.985
It was thrilling, actually.

39:07.019 --> 39:09.655
I'm not embarrassed to say it.

39:30.342 --> 39:33.878
( moaning )

39:40.019 --> 39:41.853
- Uh--
- huh?

39:41.887 --> 39:43.688
Oh.

39:43.723 --> 39:46.191
<i>( moaning continues )</i>

39:55.333 --> 39:57.568
You're being awfully quiet.

40:04.776 --> 40:07.678
- I saw Jimmy.
- <i>Oh?</i>

40:07.712 --> 40:10.181
And how are the newlyweds
getting along?

40:10.215 --> 40:12.650
Fine, I suppose.

40:12.685 --> 40:14.619
He was alone.

40:14.653 --> 40:17.455
We need to send them something.

40:17.490 --> 40:19.491
I already took care of it.

40:24.229 --> 40:26.364
What is it?

40:29.968 --> 40:32.703
He's holding something back.

40:32.737 --> 40:36.607
When he was a kid, he
confided in me-- everything.

40:36.641 --> 40:39.543
- Where was his father?
- <i>He was here.</i>

40:39.577 --> 40:41.244
<i>Disinterested.</i>

40:41.278 --> 40:43.747
The commodore needs
to be in control.

40:43.782 --> 40:47.385
10-year-old boy?
There's no controlling that.

40:50.356 --> 40:52.591
Now of course, he's around.

40:56.563 --> 40:59.399
- You're jealous.
- I'm angry.

40:59.434 --> 41:01.801
He's got something
up his sleeve.

41:01.836 --> 41:05.071
I was father and mother to that kid,

41:05.106 --> 41:07.708
with Gillian out all hours?

41:07.742 --> 41:10.912
I nursed him through malaria,
took him camping,

41:10.946 --> 41:14.348
gave him the run of
that goddamn boardwalk.

41:18.786 --> 41:21.888
There is another boy
down the hall.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.929
He was playing with matches.

41:27.963 --> 41:32.000
- Matches. - I saw the sister.
She told me.

41:33.470 --> 41:37.273
- <i>Did you speak to him?</i>
- He offered no explanation.

41:38.642 --> 41:42.779
I'm afraid he's developed
a fascination with fire.

41:44.748 --> 41:47.616
What's that all about?

41:47.651 --> 41:50.852
- P.A.: <i>Now boarding all points west...</i>
- Woman: Come on, dear.

41:58.126 --> 42:01.295
- Did you have a nice time?
- I did.

42:01.329 --> 42:03.964
Although I suppose
I've been kidding myself

42:03.998 --> 42:06.100
to think I could live here.

42:07.503 --> 42:10.471
Sodom by the sea.

42:14.477 --> 42:16.846
I miss you, Nelson.

42:24.923 --> 42:27.691
Until next month.

42:27.726 --> 42:30.694
Thank you for a lovely weekend.

42:33.265 --> 42:35.466
Travel safely and with God.

42:37.636 --> 42:42.007
- Man: <i>Porter, porter!
</i> - P.A.: <i>Now boarding for all points north:</i>

42:42.041 --> 42:46.312
<i>New York, Mount Vernon,</i>
<i>White Plains and Pleasantville.</i>

43:15.676 --> 43:19.012
- Just in time.
- I could smell it from upstairs.

43:19.046 --> 43:21.647
It smells good.

43:22.916 --> 43:25.051
Who was on the telephone?

43:25.086 --> 43:27.420
My father.

43:29.390 --> 43:32.393
He and my mother are gonna
take Tommy to the carousel.

43:34.562 --> 43:36.463
What's this?

43:36.498 --> 43:39.901
Oh, from Nucky.
A wedding gift.

43:39.936 --> 43:42.637
Should we open it?

43:42.672 --> 43:45.374
- Is there any coffee?
- It's on the boil.

43:57.723 --> 43:59.991
Thank you.

44:03.128 --> 44:06.797
The coloreds, they won't
give us any trouble?

44:06.832 --> 44:10.000
The earlier we get there,
the quieter it will be.

44:15.574 --> 44:19.209
You don't have to feel embarrassed
to eat in front of us, Richard.

44:21.546 --> 44:25.216
Why don't you take
some biscuits for later?

44:33.093 --> 44:35.662
<i>How's that</i>
<i>coffee, Ange?</i>

44:57.882 --> 45:01.985
How does it feel
to have everything?

45:17.370 --> 45:19.504
Hey, kiddo.

45:19.539 --> 45:23.108
- What are you up to in here?
- Playing soldier.

45:26.479 --> 45:28.546
I'd like to talk to you.

45:28.581 --> 45:30.515
<i>Yes sir.</i>

45:43.028 --> 45:45.129
What are you doing?

45:45.163 --> 45:47.398
Getting ready for the belt.

45:47.433 --> 45:50.936
No no, Teddy,
I'm not going to beat you.

46:07.354 --> 46:09.923
You need to mind your mother.

46:09.957 --> 46:11.858
And the sisters at school.

46:11.892 --> 46:14.627
Yes sir.

46:14.662 --> 46:17.030
And no more misbehaving,

46:17.064 --> 46:19.332
playing with matches.

46:49.526 --> 46:52.095
Run along now--
the sweetshop.

46:52.129 --> 46:55.665
- And be a good boy.
- Thank you.

47:02.807 --> 47:04.942

48:45.808 --> 48:48.044
Nearly 4:00 p.m.

48:55.820 --> 48:58.388
I fell asleep.

49:00.191 --> 49:02.559
I have your money.

49:03.827 --> 49:07.196
For the last two weeks, right?

49:16.505 --> 49:18.872
Come lay with me, daddy.

49:18.907 --> 49:21.808
You need to sleep
in your own room.

49:38.528 --> 49:38.594
Doyle: And there you have that.

49:45.403 --> 49:48.071
So tell me-- should I be concerned

49:48.105 --> 49:50.740
That there's blood on
some of these crates?

49:50.774 --> 49:52.809
Not unless it's your own.

49:52.843 --> 49:54.878
( giggles )

49:59.117 --> 50:01.885
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

50:12.630 --> 50:14.263
Hello?

50:14.298 --> 50:17.267
Eddie: <i>Nucky, there is a man here</i>
<i>from the state's attorney.</i>

50:17.301 --> 50:19.202
<i>He says</i>
<i>he must see you.</i>

50:19.236 --> 50:21.604
- What does he want?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

50:21.638 --> 50:24.507
Put him on the line.

50:27.512 --> 50:29.479
<i>He says you must</i>
<i>come immediately,</i>

50:29.514 --> 50:32.249
- <i>That it is urgent.</i>
- For god's sake.

50:35.887 --> 50:37.955
Everything all right?

50:38.824 --> 50:41.291
Yes, fine.

50:41.326 --> 50:43.393
I told Teddy we'd
all go to the pictures.

50:43.427 --> 50:45.028
The Chaplin film is
at the Royal.

50:45.063 --> 50:48.999
- Very well.
- <i>I need to stop by the office first.</i>

50:49.033 --> 50:50.901
I won't be long.

50:52.737 --> 50:55.539
You go, I'll meet you over there.

I'm a deputy with the

Mr. Thompson, you're under
