00:01.200 --> 00:02.599
(elevator dings)

00:07.340 --> 00:09.331
Madam State's
Attorney.

00:09.370 --> 00:10.769
Thank you, David.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.401
Well done,
Alicia, truly.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.044
Julius, you're back.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.048
We're closing the
New York offices.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.672
Wow, thank you,
everyone.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.449
I'm honored, I am.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.016
Thank you.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.719
Her office is mine.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.513
Already called dibs.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.118
Thank you.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.388
Thank you so much.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.432
This is insane.

00:39.470 --> 00:41.290
Wow, look at
all this stuff.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.739
I want the muffins.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.772
And whatever this is.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.646
Well, thank you, police union.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.443
What are you doing?
I'm not
working today.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.141
I'm gonna have
a celebratory glass.

00:53.180 --> 00:55.569
You can't-- you're only
allowed to consume gifts

00:55.620 --> 00:57.315
under $75 according to
Cook County ethics rules.

00:57.350 --> 00:58.510
You're kidding.
No.

00:58.550 --> 00:59.380
I've been reading
up on them.

00:59.420 --> 01:00.785
Here, have a muffin.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.424
Well, what do I do
with this-- it's open.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.292
Breakage.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.167
Mr. Castro.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.360
Alicia.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.560
Congratulations.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.794
ALICIA:
Thank you.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.398
Ah, yes.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.839
The honeymoon period.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.474
Oh, this is, uh,
Marissa, she's my...

01:20.510 --> 01:21.875
Executive assistant.

01:21.910 --> 01:23.844
...my executive
assistant.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.404
May I, uh, sit?

01:25.450 --> 01:26.542
Oh, yes, please.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.218
Um, uh... here.

01:31.590 --> 01:32.682
Do you mind
if we speak alone?

01:32.720 --> 01:35.188
Oh, um, Marissa
is helping me

01:35.220 --> 01:36.426
through the
transition.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.257
I trust her
implicitly.
Muffin?

01:38.290 --> 01:40.292
No, thank you.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.564
Alicia, we've had
our differences,

01:45.600 --> 01:46.828
but I want to bury
the hatchet.

01:46.870 --> 01:48.861
I want this passing
of the baton to be smooth.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.458
Likewise.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.375
Uh, one way to assure
that success is

01:52.410 --> 01:54.207
continuity
in the office,

01:54.240 --> 01:56.447
which is why
I strongly urge you

01:56.480 --> 01:58.448
to keep Phil Lorie
as chief deputy.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.675
He's, uh, he's
a good strategist,

02:00.720 --> 02:02.585
not to mention loyal.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.383
I'm sure he is.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.809
But I am going in
another direction.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.226
So thank you, but no.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.798
Uh, one more thing.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.196
I'm sure I don't need
to mention this,

02:15.230 --> 02:17.198
but it is customary
for the incoming SA

02:17.230 --> 02:19.198
not to investigate
the outgoing SA...

02:19.240 --> 02:21.333
MAN: Cary, hang on,
can you take a look at this?

02:21.370 --> 02:23.600
...especially given our,
uh, past encounters.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.868
You mean the prosecution
of my partner?

02:24.910 --> 02:26.502
Yes, given that,

02:26.540 --> 02:27.939
I thought I would remind you
of that rule.

02:27.980 --> 02:28.901
That unwritten rule.

02:32.220 --> 02:35.815
When I became SA, I was
encouraged to look forward,

02:35.850 --> 02:38.489
not back,
and there were a lot of things

02:38.520 --> 02:40.317
to look back at
with your husband.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.726
If there was a gross
mishandling of cases, James,

02:42.760 --> 02:45.251
they shouldn't be swept
under the rug, should they?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.496
You come after me,

02:46.530 --> 02:48.418
I will...
You'll what, James?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.927
You're a lame duck.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.892
Well...

02:55.940 --> 02:57.737
a lame duck can still
tank your record

02:57.770 --> 02:59.374
before you
get started.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.207
I can overload you
with loser cases

03:01.240 --> 03:03.640
so your stats will be screwed
when you drop them.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.544
Is there a problem?

03:08.580 --> 03:10.548
Your friend,
Alicia Florrick,

03:10.590 --> 03:13.616
she's playing on a field where
she thinks she knows the rules.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.854
She doesn't.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.251
For the record, you have
my permission to hold a grudge.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.449
(laughs)

03:20.500 --> 03:23.469
Congratulations,
Ms. State's Attorney.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.660
Thank you, Cary.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.589
It's like, uh,
King Tut's tomb in here.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.664
Yeah.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.804
If King Tut
didn't have

03:30.840 --> 03:32.432
to obey the
ethic rules.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.731
(cell phone rings)

03:33.780 --> 03:35.532
Sorry.

03:35.580 --> 03:36.672
Kalinda, good morning.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.302
Congratulations.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.545
Thank you, are you
on your way in?

03:40.580 --> 03:41.911
We are swimming in wine
and champagne here.

03:41.950 --> 03:42.917
Cheap champagne.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.508
Sounds good.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.757
Listen, Lemond Bishop
asked me to call.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.781
Uh, I think he wants to talk.

03:48.820 --> 03:49.855
Okay, good.

03:49.890 --> 03:50.925
Tell him to
come on In.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.520
Come on in?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.528
Uh, are you sure?

03:55.560 --> 03:57.027
Look, he's fine on the phone.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.698
No, no, I think
it's better in the open.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.696
Okay, look, I think
he wants to talk about...

04:01.740 --> 04:02.934
what you could do for him.

04:02.970 --> 04:05.564
Yeah, okay, tell him
to come on in.

04:05.610 --> 04:08.374
I'm fine,
thank you, Kalinda.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.549
Alicia, did you knock over
a cheese and wine store?

04:10.580 --> 04:12.616
ALICIA: (laughs) What's
the point in having power

04:12.650 --> 04:13.674
if you can't use it?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.472
Time to negotiate?

04:15.520 --> 04:17.579
Yeah, let's go see
what they're offering.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.417
Well, with David
Lee involved,

04:19.460 --> 04:21.018
I think I know.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.721
$350,000.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.489
Really, David?
Yes, if you agree
to these terms,

04:24.530 --> 04:25.679
we can cut a
check today.

04:25.730 --> 04:26.890
Alicia's capital
contribution alone

04:26.930 --> 04:28.898
is worth half a million.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.591
DIANE: Yes, and as Alicia
is well aware,

04:30.630 --> 04:32.632
we have had to pay

04:32.670 --> 04:33.864
for significant
capital improvements

04:33.900 --> 04:35.697
upon assuming
these offices,

04:35.740 --> 04:37.560
all of which falls
on the partners.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.963
POLMAR: We want this to be
a dignified exit.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.773
JULIUS: We all do.
POLMAR: And yet here we are,

04:40.810 --> 04:42.949
$300,000 short of dignified.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.744
DAVID:
We're all family here,

04:45.780 --> 04:47.748
but our cash reserves
have been depleted.

04:47.780 --> 04:51.739
Surely Alicia knows that we were
bruised by the loss of Chumhum.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.985
Yes, and because of
the loss of Chumhum,

04:54.020 --> 04:56.625
client retention is
even more critical.

04:56.660 --> 05:00.619
Which is why I am assuring
all my clients

05:00.660 --> 05:02.992
that they're
in good hands.

05:03.030 --> 05:04.827
We_have a
depOSItlon now.

05:04.870 --> 05:06.428
Why don't we all
think about it

05:06.470 --> 05:07.664
and get back together
later in the day?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.907
POLMAR:
Just so long as we know

05:09.940 --> 05:13.728
that Alicia needs
$300,000 more to be happy.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.338
Okay.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.540
We have her
over a barrel.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.377
Now that she's an SA,

05:18.410 --> 05:20.810
she has to divest her
financial interests immediately.

05:20.850 --> 05:22.408
So we stick with
the lowball.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.849
No-- if we piss her off,

05:23.890 --> 05:25.687
we put all our future
criminal cases at risk.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.085
No, Alicia's no Castro.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.712
She wouldn't let
this hurt our clients.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.558
Come on, she deserves the
money-- she built this firm.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.399
And abandoned it.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.829
Uh, then we bump it up
another hundred thou.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.418
I can agree to that.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.665
God, great negotiating
stance, Julius.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.691
Did you learn
that in New York?
(Julius argues indistinctly)

05:40.740 --> 05:41.695
We have a deposition.

05:41.740 --> 05:43.537
Shh...
let's not fight.

05:43.570 --> 05:46.539
Wharfmaster began
as a labor of love.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.536
Sharing software in development
has always been difficult

05:48.580 --> 05:50.571
because of the size
of the files.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.578
That's why peer-to-peer sites
were created.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.474
So the average user
of Wharfmaster

05:54.520 --> 05:56.112
is an entrepreneurial
programmer

05:56.150 --> 05:57.549
looking to share
his latest creation?

05:57.590 --> 05:59.717
I, uh, have
a novel idea.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.149
How about we tone down the snark
and keep this CIVII?

06:02.190 --> 06:03.987
MAN:
I don't know about average,

06:04.030 --> 06:06.624
but, yes, programmers are
our biggest client base.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.628
And yet 80%
of Wharfmaster's traffic

06:08.660 --> 06:10.594
comes from copyrighted
music and films.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.598
Uh, nice parsing
of numbers, Mr. Agos.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.868
That 80% reflects
the number

06:13.900 --> 06:16.095
of downloads,
not traffic.

06:16.140 --> 06:19.109
And yet our client's movie was
downloaded four million times

06:19.140 --> 06:21.574
on your site before
it opened in theaters.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.942
4.2 million.
DIANE: 4.2 million times.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.517
So when it finally premiered,
the box office was depressed.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.939
I'm sorry, Mr. Dalton, but I
saw In Bra when it opened,

06:28.980 --> 06:30.948
and the box office
was depressed

06:30.990 --> 06:32.548
because the movie
wasn't very good.

06:32.590 --> 06:34.478
Well, thanks for the review,
jackass. Listen,

06:34.520 --> 06:36.659
why don't you stop encouraging
people to illegally download?

06:36.690 --> 06:37.850
And then maybe you
wouldn't find yourself

06:37.890 --> 06:39.653
in this situation.
(overlapping chatter)

06:39.700 --> 06:40.997
Gentlemen, please.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.497
I'm sorry.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.191
I'm sorry that there are
illegal downloads.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.698
I really am,
but I'm like the post office.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.890
People pick up and drop off
letters and parcels.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.909
I can't control _if _some
of that actIVIty IS Illegal.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.500
Because I'm not looking inside
of the parcels.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.508
CARY: So, Mr. Bacevich,
you and your employees have

06:56.550 --> 06:58.541
no specific knowledge
of any illegal downloading?

06:58.580 --> 07:00.138
Is that correct?
That's correct.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.738
Good. One second.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.914
Uh-oh.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.508
We're in trouble now.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.448
(music plays)

07:08.490 --> 07:09.650
ANDREWS (laughs):
What is this?

07:09.690 --> 07:11.624
I'm on hold with the
Wharfmaster help line.

07:11.660 --> 07:14.220
Is this really
necessary?
Hmm.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.659
MAN:
Welcome to Wharfmaster.

07:15.700 --> 07:16.962
My name is Rami,
how can I help you?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.763
KALINDA:
HI, RamI.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.769
I'm having some trouble
downloading a file.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.609
Okay, what kind of file?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.005
It's _the movie
American Sniper.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.598
Oh, come on...

07:26.640 --> 07:29.006
Okay, how big is the file?

07:29.040 --> 07:31.099
It's about
700 megabytes.

07:31.150 --> 07:34.779
Are you using a VPN connection
when you connect to Wharfmaster?

07:34.820 --> 07:37.015
Oh. Oh, um...

07:37.050 --> 07:38.938
There it goes, it
started to download.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.548
Thank you so much
for your help.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.751
No problem, have a nice day.

07:42.790 --> 07:45.554
Your client claimed that neither
he nor anyone at Wharfmaster

07:45.590 --> 07:47.820
has specific knowledge
of illegal downloading.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.964
And yet here is
his help desk

07:50.000 --> 07:51.968
being helpful illegally
downloading a movie.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.968
_ So shall we
discuss a number?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.507
Mrs. State's Attorney...

07:58.540 --> 07:59.700
Mr. Redmayne.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.231
Look at how she basks
in her power, Crystal.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.248
Huh? I know that look.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.838
Now get over here.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.848
Get over here,
come on.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.847
Okay.

08:08.880 --> 08:09.847
Oh, yes.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.243
Yes, yes, yes.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.951
Yes...
This is my assistant,

08:12.990 --> 08:14.287
this is a great...
my personal
assistant, Marissa.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.787
Executive assistant.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.856
Yeah, all right, well,
look at all this crap.

08:17.890 --> 08:19.050
What did we
send over, Crystal?

08:19.090 --> 08:20.125
A chess board.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.048
Uh, made out
of human teeth.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.068
Well, anyway, can I
sit over there?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.067
Oh, please.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.658
Thank you.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.588
Is it really made
out of human teeth?

08:28.640 --> 08:30.801
So I thought I'd get
together with you

08:30.840 --> 08:34.799
to talk before the crowds
descended on you,

08:34.840 --> 08:36.649
you know whatI mean?

08:36.680 --> 08:38.238
Everybody with their
hands outstretched.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.248
"Me, me, me, me!"

08:40.280 --> 08:42.043
(chuckles)
We're fine here.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.786
Why don't you, uh,
sit here next to me?

08:43.820 --> 08:45.242
Um, no, I'm fine.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.882
Oh, I know you are,

08:46.920 --> 08:48.649
but I-I want you
to sit near me.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.759
Please.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.121
Pretty please.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.754
Ah, good.
Good, good, good.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.768
Now, I started out
in sales, shoe sales.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.324
Did I ever tell
you that, Crystal?

08:58.370 --> 08:59.997
And there you
have to look

09:00.040 --> 09:02.600
into the customer's
eyes.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.834
And-and that's
the way you know

09:03.870 --> 09:06.134
whether you've made
a sale or not.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.604
Is there something you want
to sell me, Mr. Redmayne?

09:08.640 --> 09:10.141
I love women's feet.

09:10.180 --> 09:13.343
You can always tell
a woman's taste from her feet.

09:13.380 --> 09:17.840
There's this whore in Arizona,
what was her name, Crystal?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.313
She had the most
elegant little feet.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.316
Would you like a muffin?
Brittney.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.055
Yeah, cute little
piece of ass.

09:24.090 --> 09:27.856
And she could do the most
amazing things with her feet.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.868
And your feet
are like hers.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.063
Is there something you
need, uh, Mr. Redmayne?

09:33.100 --> 09:37.799
Well, yeah, I want you
to appoint Dean Lumber

09:37.840 --> 09:39.034
as your major deputy.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.209
Why?
I've known him
20 years.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.208
He's a hell of a guy,
he's a hell of a lawyer.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.741
He'd be good
for your office here.

09:45.780 --> 09:47.179
Uh, Crystal?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.915
Set up a meeting
with Dean.

09:48.950 --> 09:49.917
Uh, no.

09:49.950 --> 09:51.747
Well, have
your secretary do it.

09:51.790 --> 09:52.950
I don't care.
No, thank you.

09:52.990 --> 09:55.049
I'm going in
another direction.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.752
Uh, now, look,

09:58.790 --> 09:59.950
I know you're new
to this office,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.956
so I'll cut you
a little slack.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.889
But I spent a lot of zeros
to help you get elected.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.295
And I appreciate
your contribution.

10:06.330 --> 10:08.059
I don't want
your appreCIation.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.898
I want you to appoint Dean
as your number two man.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.306
Okay, well, I'm so glad you
stopped by, Mr. Redmayne.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.035
MY: my, mY-

10:15.080 --> 10:18.049
I-I spent seven figures...

10:18.080 --> 10:21.049
putting you into office.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.244
It won't cost me nearly as much
to get you out of it.

10:26.990 --> 10:28.753
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.224
REDMAYNE:
Oh, aha, another suitor.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.399
My, my goodness.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.795
I should have known.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.229
It's always the
colored guys.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.262
Excuse me?
No, no, don't
worry about it.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.393
I-I'm on your
side, you got it?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.793
I gave enough

10:41.840 --> 10:43.262
to the Negro
College Fund

10:43.310 --> 10:45.904
to give the whole friggin'
Congo a scholarship.

10:45.940 --> 10:48.272
Let's go, doll.
You know, this, um,

10:48.310 --> 10:50.699
this may seem like power
to you, but it isn't.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.342
You give me 20 hours,

10:52.380 --> 10:55.213
I'll show you power.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.148
Excuse me.

11:07.060 --> 11:09.028
Who the hell was that?

11:09.060 --> 11:10.721
(sighs)

11:22.480 --> 11:24.277
Shall we close the door?

11:24.310 --> 11:26.301
No, that's
not necessary.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.718
For my benefit, then.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.240
I'll get it.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.258
BISHOP:
It was a close race.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.087
It was.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.382
Well, congratulations.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.229
Thank you.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.989
I want to talk
about my future.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.224
And yours.

11:41.260 --> 11:45.219
I'm ready to leave
the business.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.761
You are?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.802
My son is at
the age now

11:49.840 --> 11:52.229
where I want to devote
more time to him.

11:52.270 --> 11:53.476
Good.

11:53.510 --> 11:54.932
Smart.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.800
ButIJlneed
your help.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.249
With your son?

11:58.280 --> 11:59.440
Uh, no.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.142
With my transition.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.182
Out of the business.

12:05.390 --> 12:06.982
Do you want me
toleave?

12:07.020 --> 12:08.157
No.

12:08.190 --> 12:11.387
It might make
things smoother.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.250
No, I think it's better
if Marissa stays.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.268
I've noticed
what happens

12:18.300 --> 12:21.497
when people of my stature
leave the business.

12:21.540 --> 12:25.499
They lose their power,
and they either...

12:25.540 --> 12:29.032
become imprisoned
or deceased.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.308
I can prevent
the latter.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.170
I need your help in
preventing the former.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.848
What help?

12:33.880 --> 12:36.417
I need you to stop Geneva
Pine's investigation.

12:36.450 --> 12:37.485
What investigation?

12:37.520 --> 12:38.942
Into me.

12:44.090 --> 12:46.058
I suggest this,
Mr. Bishop,

12:46.090 --> 12:49.253
I will cheerfully quash
the investigation into you

12:49.300 --> 12:52.895
and offer you
a full grant of immunity

12:52.940 --> 12:55.295
in trade for your testimony
against your lieutenants.

12:59.370 --> 13:02.430
You know I would
never do that.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.448
You're turning over
a new leaf.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.299
For your son.

13:07.350 --> 13:09.341
I funded your PAC.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.887
I started your PAC.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.956
I kept it going...
I never asked you to.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.582
Please extend me the courtesy
of not interrupting.

13:17.630 --> 13:22.329
I spent $1 million
on your campaign.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.964
That's a lot of money.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.422
I don't expect to be treated
like the hired help.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.290
Mr. Bishop, I'm not
treating you...
I'll go public.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.228
About my support.

13:31.070 --> 13:34.870
You can, but the campaign laws
also protect me.

13:34.910 --> 13:36.309
I can't coordinate
with my PAC.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.274
This was not
a smart move.

13:42.650 --> 13:45.483
This was not a
smart move at all.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.348
All right,
where were we?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.994
Uh, you were asking
my client for $28 million.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.930
Which I said
wasn't an offer.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.335
It was a punch line.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.065
Your contention is

14:04.110 --> 14:07.432
that the market for your movie
In Brain was strangled

14:07.480 --> 14:08.629
by the downloads
of said film.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.272
The illegal downloads.

14:10.310 --> 14:11.470
Uh, you are aware

14:11.510 --> 14:13.478
that In Brain,
uh, was released

14:13.520 --> 14:17.342
on, uh, Wharfmaster
on February 3 of this year?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.346
I am, two days
before it opened in theaters.

14:19.390 --> 14:20.550
That's why I'm suing you.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.319
And do you know
who uploaded it?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.328
Probably some hacker
in his mother's basement.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.954
No, it was you.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.524
Excuse me?

14:28.560 --> 14:30.960
This file was uploaded

14:31.000 --> 14:34.629
by Gemstone Publicity,
one of your contractors.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.638
As you can see,

14:36.670 --> 14:39.662
the, uh, digital
code is identical.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.678
Come on, Gemstone's got
nothing to do with us.

14:41.710 --> 14:44.543
They're a PR company that
we hired to do viral marketing.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.377
To build buzz
for the movie.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.219
ANDREWS: And part of that
"buzz" was on Wharfmaster.

14:48.250 --> 14:51.481
Right, um, why don't we
take a moment here?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.525
What the hell
are you doing?

14:57.560 --> 15:00.597
Uh, thank you,
Pastor Jeremiah.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.222
No, no, no.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.227
I appreciate it.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.225
Okay.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.464
Good, good-bye.

15:06.970 --> 15:08.562
(clears throat)

15:08.600 --> 15:10.465
You were saying?
What the hell
are you doing?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.102
Hi, Dad.
Oh, don't
"Hi, Dad" me.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.937
You're supposed
to be keeping her in line.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.572
Eli, can you give me
a subject, please?

15:15.610 --> 15:16.941
Anything?

15:16.980 --> 15:19.301
Guy Redmayne--
he just called me.

15:19.350 --> 15:21.716
You mean the man, Guy
Redmayne, who came in here

15:21.750 --> 15:23.718
and pressed his
groin against me,

15:23.750 --> 15:27.311
compared my feet to those
of an Arizona prostitute,

15:27.360 --> 15:30.420
and then demanded that I hire
a deputy SA of his choosing?

15:30.460 --> 15:32.428
Yes, him. So?

15:32.460 --> 15:33.449
So I told him no.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.092
I told him _it
was my ch0ice.

15:35.130 --> 15:36.449
And, yes, his money
got me elected,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.058
but that_ didn't make
me his servant.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.624
Ugh, dear God, of course it
didn't make you his servant.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.467
Yeah, and that's
what I told him.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.459
Alicia, I have spent a long time
being your confidant and friend.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.307
We have disagreed
on many things,

15:47.340 --> 15:50.605
but I have always respected you,
always, until now.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.277
Eli.

15:52.310 --> 15:53.709
I won't be like Peter.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.308
Then don't be.

15:55.350 --> 15:56.715
Of course you're gonna
make your own decision,

15:56.750 --> 15:58.547
of course you're not gonna
do what Redmayne asks,

15:58.590 --> 16:00.148
but you don't
tell him that.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.555
You don't tell
him the truth.

16:01.590 --> 16:02.557
No, shut up.

16:02.590 --> 16:03.488
Listen to me.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.485
(sighs)

16:04.530 --> 16:05.724
You know the truth.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.193
Here, in your heart.

16:07.230 --> 16:09.721
Good, be a Disney
princess,

16:09.760 --> 16:11.489
but don't tell moneymen
like Redmayne anything

16:11.530 --> 16:12.497
but what they want to hear.

16:12.530 --> 16:13.690
Even if it's a lie?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.492
Yes, because it won't be a lie

16:15.540 --> 16:16.689
when you tell it.

16:16.740 --> 16:20.335
Absence of yes times time
equals no.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.336
That's the law.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.348
If you're in doubt,
you don't say no,

16:24.380 --> 16:26.348
you say,
"Thank you for your advice.

16:26.380 --> 16:27.540
"All options are open to me.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.515
I plan to decide
in the next 48 hours."

16:30.550 --> 16:32.609
Well, what happens
in 48 hours?

16:32.650 --> 16:34.618
You do whatever you like,
or you delay again,

16:34.660 --> 16:37.083
but you never, ever say no,
because anything could happen.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.586
Redmayne will get
just as angry if she delays.

16:38.630 --> 16:39.483
No, he won't.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.589
Men like him don't
want you to say yes,

16:41.630 --> 16:43.598
they want you to say,
"I'm listening."

16:43.630 --> 16:45.222
They want to be able
to tell their friends,

16:45.270 --> 16:47.295
"I have the ear of the SA.
She listens to me."

16:47.340 --> 16:48.591
He's rich, he's forgetful.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.436
Alicia, look at me!

16:49.470 --> 16:52.769
I know of which I speak,
and you don't.

16:52.810 --> 16:54.300
And you don't either.

16:56.810 --> 16:59.540
So what do I do?

16:59.580 --> 17:02.219
I bring Redmayne back in here,
and you kiss his ass.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.218
And you shut
the hell up.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.319
Okay?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.351
Do what you
have to do.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.656
He's right
about unclean hands.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.362
Our client created the problem
for which he's suing.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.197
Hmm, so what are we
supposed to argue?

17:21.240 --> 17:23.231
Our client only wanted his
copyright infringed a little?

17:25.270 --> 17:26.828
No, we pivot.

17:26.870 --> 17:29.839
Trademark tarnishment?

17:29.880 --> 17:31.848
(laughs)

17:31.880 --> 17:33.211
Are you kidding me?

17:33.250 --> 17:34.649
(laughs)
No, sir.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.671
We're not arguing
copyright infringement,

17:36.720 --> 17:39.518
which is, as you know,
hard to win.

17:39.550 --> 17:40.858
We are arguing
that you tarn...

17:40.890 --> 17:42.710
I'm not sure how
you can Win that.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.649
Uh, In Bra was
released in 4K,

17:45.690 --> 17:47.658
the highest
resolution possible.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.689
Kalinda.

17:48.730 --> 17:49.697
ANDREWS:
Oh, here we go.

17:49.730 --> 17:51.527
Superwoman is back.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.095
I'm now searching
for In Brain, and...

17:55.640 --> 17:58.564
...the banner ads--
they're hard-core porn.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.601
ANDREWS:
Oh, come on.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.779
DIANE:
Mr. Dalton, are you careful
where you advertise your movie?

18:02.810 --> 18:04.778
Very careful.
You would
never assoaate

18:04.810 --> 18:07.779
with a porn
site like...

18:07.820 --> 18:09.776
"Teenagers
and Hounds"?

18:09.820 --> 18:13.153
No, one is very careful
with one's brand.

18:13.190 --> 18:14.680
JULIUS:
I see.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.621
One might even call this...
trademark tarnishment.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.628
Mr. Redmayne,
you had some advice

18:21.660 --> 18:23.469
you wanted to share
with Alicia.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.297
Uh, I did, but I don't think
she wants to hear it.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.696
ELI: Oh, she does, Alicia's
just a little thrown

18:27.740 --> 18:29.696
by all the changes in
her circumstances, aren't you?

18:29.740 --> 18:32.709
Yes, I'm sorry,
Mr. Redmayne.

18:32.740 --> 18:36.335
I was trying to get
my bearings here,

18:36.380 --> 18:39.144
and I'm, uh, afraid I
came across more boldly

18:39.180 --> 18:40.545
than I wanted to.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.548
I don't think
I understand.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.184
Well, what Alicia
means is...

18:44.220 --> 18:45.744
No, I know what
you think she means.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.758
I want to hear
what she thinks she means.

18:47.790 --> 18:51.556
I want to hear your
advice, Mr. Redmayne.

18:51.590 --> 18:54.559
All options...

18:54.600 --> 18:57.296
are open to me as SA.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.662
And, uh, I will decide

18:59.700 --> 19:03.500
what to do in the
next 48 hours.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.759
Guy.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.232
Guy.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.703
Uh, what do you think,
Crystal?

19:09.740 --> 19:11.674
Is this a bad penny?
ELI: Guy, you wanted

19:11.710 --> 19:13.849
a welcome ear in the SA's
office, well, AliCia is it.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.609
You like Taylor Swift?

19:15.650 --> 19:17.379
Excuse me?

19:17.420 --> 19:19.388
Taylor Swift, you know,
"Shake That Thing."

19:19.420 --> 19:20.387
Uh, what is it?

19:20.420 --> 19:21.387
"Shake It Off."

19:21.420 --> 19:22.580
"Sh-Shake It Off," right.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.757
"Shake It Off,"
I love that song.

19:23.790 --> 19:25.758
Do you?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.326
Do I?

19:27.360 --> 19:28.691
Uh, do I?

19:28.730 --> 19:29.890
Yes.

19:29.930 --> 19:31.727
The current SA,
what's his name?

19:31.770 --> 19:32.464
Castro.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.196
(chuckling):
Yeah, Castro. Right.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.458
He's been looking into
some real estate deals

19:37.510 --> 19:38.909
of mine
in Jefferson Park.

19:38.940 --> 19:40.908
It's nothing more
than a shakedown.

19:40.940 --> 19:44.307
But I'd like to be relieved
of the-the tension.

19:44.350 --> 19:48.946
Well, all options
are open to me, Guy.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.584
I like that.

19:52.590 --> 19:54.558
Eli, you're a man
of great depth.

19:54.590 --> 19:55.784
I've always told
you that, sir.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.378
Yeah, now I'm
a believer.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.455
Praise Jesus.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.991
_ I'll be _ _
seeing you, AliCia.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.497
Give me a hug.

20:02.530 --> 20:03.519
Come on, we can...

20:06.570 --> 20:09.539
I have to say I was surprised
by the invitation to come back.

20:09.570 --> 20:10.867
ELI:
Well, Alicia called me

20:10.910 --> 20:12.707
and said
she wasn't thrilled

20:12.740 --> 20:14.537
with the way
she left it.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.536
I probably spoke too soon
about your chief deputy.

20:16.580 --> 20:19.299
And some other issues.

20:19.350 --> 20:20.510
I'm so glad to hear it.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.518
All options are open to me,

20:22.550 --> 20:25.519
and I plan to decide
in 48 hours.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.359
KALIN DA:
Web sites?

20:27.390 --> 20:30.359
ANDREWS: Yes, what sort
of Web sites do you search

20:30.390 --> 20:32.358
when you surf the Web,
Ms. Sharma?

20:32.390 --> 20:34.824
I do research for the firm,

20:34.860 --> 20:37.420
track down witnesses.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.028
Case work.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.731
You surf a lot of porn,
Ms. Sharma?

20:40.770 --> 20:41.998
No.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.564
Uh, you are
under oath, ma'am.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.861
Oh, I'm not married.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.639
You don't need
to address me as ma'am.

20:46.670 --> 20:49.798
Thanks-- you surf a lot
of porn, mademoiselle?

20:49.840 --> 20:51.671
No.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.508
Ms. Sharma, whose computer
did you use?

20:54.550 --> 20:55.517
Hi.

20:55.550 --> 20:58.519
So this is
your laptop?

20:58.550 --> 20:59.915
Well, I use it.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.554
I use it only
when I don't want

21:01.590 --> 21:03.285
to use the one
that's on my desk.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.582
And do you surf
a lot of porn, sir?

21:05.630 --> 21:07.655
Well, define "surf."

21:07.700 --> 21:09.759
What does this have to do
with trademark tarnishment?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.597
Wharfmaster's ads
are targeted.

21:11.630 --> 21:13.598
Advertisers track a
user's online behaVIor

21:13.640 --> 21:14.993
and tailor
ads to them.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.632
The only people who see
ads for pornography

21:16.670 --> 21:18.433
are people
who like it.

21:18.470 --> 21:19.630
Wait a minute, I don't
like pornography.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.001
I just, you know...

21:21.040 --> 21:22.769
I get targeted, I
just get targeted.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.673
Oh, uh, why don't we
take a break here?

21:26.710 --> 21:28.712
We can bump
it up $50,000.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.939
You're serious.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.029
$50,000 bump
for Alicia's exit package.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.028
Yes.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.995
You see, we're ten feet apart,
and you offer an inch.

21:43.030 --> 21:45.999
I wish we were in a better
p05ition to offer more.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.638
Problem is, we don't
have any leverage.

21:49.670 --> 21:51.638
They know that you
need to divest now.

21:51.670 --> 21:54.002
No, the problem is
Cary's pissed at me.

21:54.040 --> 21:57.009
I can maybe get him to
eke out another $75,000.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.644
I'll have two kids
in college.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.649
An SA's salary will
never cover that.

22:01.680 --> 22:02.840
Let me mull it over a little.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.689
Think of another angle.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.587
Finn.
Yeah?

22:07.620 --> 22:10.054
How would you feel
about being my number two

22:10.090 --> 22:11.580
in the SA's office?
What?

22:11.630 --> 22:13.495
You know the job
better than I do.

22:13.530 --> 22:14.792
And...

22:14.830 --> 22:16.718
we work well together.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.692
Look, I'm flattered, but...

22:19.730 --> 22:20.731
But what?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.558
I don't know.

22:24.610 --> 22:25.702
Well, think about it.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.879
I will.
ALICIA: Thanks

22:27.910 --> 22:30.674
to you and the Lakeshore
Women's Group, Mrs. Riggin,

22:30.710 --> 22:32.974
for the wine.

22:33.010 --> 22:34.944
Right, I meant biscotti.
(chuckles)

22:34.980 --> 22:37.039
Mom?

22:37.080 --> 22:40.789
Yes, okay.
Hope to see you soon. Thank you.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.587
What's wrong?

22:43.630 --> 22:45.882
I was Googling coverage
of your election win.

22:45.930 --> 22:48.649
Oh, don't read any of it.
Some of it will be nasty.
No,

22:48.700 --> 22:50.759
there was a hit on this site
called Legal Scholar Today.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.439
It's like, um, like a Gawker
for the legal world.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.438
They posted e-mails
from your firm.

22:55.470 --> 22:57.768
From my... What e-mails?

22:57.810 --> 23:00.677
Oh, my God.
This one's from today.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.132
"From: D. Lockhart
To: C. Agos.

23:02.180 --> 23:03.647
Subject: Alicia's exit package."

23:03.680 --> 23:05.443
Oh, my God!

23:05.480 --> 23:07.744
"Alicia has full plate.
String out negotiations best

23:07.780 --> 23:10.169
strategy. Let's frustrate
into accepting initial offer."

23:10.220 --> 23:11.585
How much of this is there?

23:11.620 --> 23:13.713
A lot. Like, a lot a lot.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.557
Somebody must've
hacked your system.

23:15.590 --> 23:17.751
Are there any from me?

23:23.130 --> 23:24.119
(laughing): Oh!

23:24.170 --> 23:26.126
Oh. Oh, oh, this is wonderful.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.161
Cary Agos to Carey Zepps.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.135
"Fourth consecutive case
Diane refuses to settle.

23:31.170 --> 23:34.537
"Clearly a senior moment.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.038
Need to loosen her up."
JULIUS: "Maybe we can

23:38.080 --> 23:41.470
"ask McVeigh to do
a better job in the sack,

23:41.520 --> 23:43.169
get the stick
out of her ass."

23:43.220 --> 23:44.812
Who wrote that? David Lee?

23:44.850 --> 23:45.885
Cary.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.518
Uh, did you see the one
from January 8?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.187
"Julius is coming
back from New York.

23:51.230 --> 23:55.018
Great, more
affirmative action bs."

23:55.060 --> 23:56.493
KALINDA:
"Did you see what she wore?

23:56.530 --> 23:59.169
Ten bucks says she's noisy."

23:59.200 --> 24:01.191
Who is that?
Carey Zepps.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.060
He thinks we're sleeping
with each other.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.237
DIANE:
And you apparently

24:04.270 --> 24:06.204
called David Lee
a racist fruitcake.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.901
What? When?

24:07.940 --> 24:10.079
I mean, I know he is, but...

24:10.110 --> 24:12.101
I don't remember writing that.

24:12.150 --> 24:15.074
(chuckles) Well, that's nothing
compared to Kalinda.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.089
So you performed oral sex on
Howard Lyman in a supply closet?

24:18.120 --> 24:20.247
What?
(chuckling): That's...
That's what he's saying.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.111
He's saying, "Good lay.
Real firecracker."

24:23.160 --> 24:25.651
"The good Mr. Lee
has done Gilbert and Sullivan.

24:25.690 --> 24:29.126
The question is, has he
done Gilbert or Sullivan?"

24:29.160 --> 24:30.821
(laughs)

24:30.870 --> 24:33.259
Or try this one.
Diane replying to David Lee:

24:33.300 --> 24:36.269
"Cary good lawyer,
not great lavwer.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.599
Going to prison
not total loss for us."

24:39.640 --> 24:41.107
You're kidding.
DIANE: All right, is everyone

24:41.140 --> 24:44.041
here? Ladies and gentlemen.
(all clamoring)

24:44.080 --> 24:45.240
Quiet.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.646
Go ahead.
Okay.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.274
I've disconnected your computers
from the network. No e-mails.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.947
Oh, are you
kidding?
What?

24:51.990 --> 24:53.787
(all clamoring)
If you need to
write something,

24:53.820 --> 24:55.151
do it on paper.
Now, uh, yeah.
Shh!

24:55.190 --> 24:57.158
I'm gonna need
all your cell phones.

24:57.190 --> 24:59.283
I need cell phones.
I want to tell
everyone here...

24:59.330 --> 25:00.592
Quiet.

25:00.630 --> 25:02.154
Shut up in back!

25:02.200 --> 25:05.192
There seems _to be
a misunderstanding here

25:05.230 --> 25:06.891
that I am gay.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.192
I am not gay.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.299
I am dating a woman, in fact.

25:10.340 --> 25:13.207
And I will sue anyone here...
Who suggests

25:13.240 --> 25:15.708
that I was hired because
of affirmative action.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.173
That's what
you people always do.
Oh, David, come on.

25:17.210 --> 25:19.041
We people? Have you
noticed you're surrounded

25:19.080 --> 25:21.048
by rich people?
Listen to you, huh?

25:21.080 --> 25:23.173
That's what you people
always do.
Okay, all right...

25:23.220 --> 25:25.916
And I do not pick my nose
during client meetings.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.759
Tell it to the disgusted
clients.
I have a deviated

25:27.790 --> 25:29.883
septum, all right? Things get
caught up there but I do not

25:29.920 --> 25:31.251
bring them to the meeting.
Calm down,
let's

25:31.290 --> 25:32.587
calm down. Come on.
We all said things

25:32.630 --> 25:34.291
that we didn't mean.

25:34.330 --> 25:36.298
Even things, Diane,
that we should take back.
What, like

25:36.330 --> 25:37.763
removing a stick from my ass?
Excuse me,

25:37.800 --> 25:39.927
you said I wasn't
much of a lawyer.

25:39.970 --> 25:43.565
DIA_NE:
Everyone, let's just calm down.
(clamoring continues)

25:45.210 --> 25:47.337
Every single partner had
their e-mails hacked except you.

25:47.370 --> 25:49.179
How is that possible?

25:49.210 --> 25:52.304
Because they only released
them from the last four months.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.773
I was using my
campaign e-mail.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.640
Wow. Lucky.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.138
(door slams)
The recriminations stop now.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.158
Everyone wrote things
in those e-mails

26:02.190 --> 26:03.657
that they clearly regret.

26:03.690 --> 26:06.250
Yes, and things
that weren't true... Howard.

26:06.290 --> 26:08.758
What? You and I were
in the supply closet.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.064
What? No, we weren't.
What planet are you living on?

26:11.100 --> 26:12.863
Stop. Stop!

26:12.900 --> 26:14.231
WE DEGd to focus on our cases

26:14.270 --> 26:16.329
or there will be
a mass exodus of clients.

26:16.370 --> 26:17.860
KaHnda?

26:17.910 --> 26:21.107
Okay, odds are this is
a hacker's reaction

26:21.140 --> 26:23.005
to the Wharfmaster case.
I mean, Nathan Bacevich

26:23.040 --> 26:25.008
is a hero in the cyber world.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.847
Do we think this is Anonymous?
I don't know.
I mean, they

26:26.880 --> 26:29.019
usually announce themselves,
but let me see what I can

26:29.050 --> 26:31.245
dig up, but this one's
not gonna be easy.
I want an update every

26:31.290 --> 26:32.917
30 minutes.
Let's get back to work.

26:32.950 --> 26:35.316
And remember:
normalcy.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.727
After you, my dear.
You and I are gonna
have a serious chat.

26:38.760 --> 26:39.886
Oh...
Oh, wait.

26:39.930 --> 26:41.693
I got an e-mail.
What is it?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.698
From E.E.-- no other name.

26:43.730 --> 26:45.391
"This is just the first batch.

26:45.430 --> 26:49.264
Tomorrow, we will release
two years of e-mails."

26:49.300 --> 26:51.234
Two years?
Yes.

26:51.270 --> 26:53.773
Does Kalinda have _
any idea who's domg this?

26:53.810 --> 26:55.232
No.
But...

26:55.280 --> 26:56.736
it's because
of the illegal download

26:56.780 --> 26:58.042
case, right?

26:58.080 --> 27:00.241
Aah! (grunting)
I can explain that!

27:00.280 --> 27:01.269
JULIUS:
Hey, hey!

27:01.320 --> 27:03.242
Break it up. Break it...
Stop it!

27:03.280 --> 27:05.180
Get out of here.
What the hell is wrong

27:05.220 --> 27:07.882
with you?
It's like a pirate ship here.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.855
Do you have any problems
over the last two years?

27:10.890 --> 27:13.358
Yes.
Yeah, me, too.

27:13.390 --> 27:16.951
And just to warn you,
I probably said some things

27:17.000 --> 27:19.423
when we were
argumg at the firm.
Same here.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.734
Let's agree: you see any e-mails

27:21.770 --> 27:24.000
from me about you, delete it.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.302
Yes.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.001
And you, too.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.338
Agreed.
Good.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.870
What a nightmare.

27:33.380 --> 27:35.018
I need you to do me a favor.

27:35.050 --> 27:37.848
Sure. What, shoot you now?
(sighs) Take my laptop,

27:37.890 --> 27:40.040
go through all my e-mails
from the last

27:40.090 --> 27:42.308
two years and find
out what I said.
That's a lot of e-mails.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.987
Can I do a word search?
Sure.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.021
With what?

27:51.030 --> 27:52.998
Anything with Will or...

27:53.030 --> 27:53.997
Elfman?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.189
No, that wouldn't

27:55.240 --> 27:56.366
be on my work e-mail.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.094
Bishop.

27:57.140 --> 28:00.769
Really?
Not sexual. Business.

28:00.810 --> 28:04.109
And Peter. Anything with
Peter. Not just his...

28:04.150 --> 28:05.378
Tell me it's not true.
It's okay,

28:05.410 --> 28:06.399
we're on top of it.
On top of what?

28:06.450 --> 28:07.974
The e-mails.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.078
Wait, what are you
talking about?

28:09.120 --> 28:11.179
Finn Polmar.
Tell me you did not

28:11.220 --> 28:12.414
ask him to be
your number two.

28:12.450 --> 28:13.951
And that's my cue.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.449
He would make
an excellent deputy.

28:17.490 --> 28:19.287
And how did you even hear?
Don't you get it?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.095
Wait, what are you talking
about? What e-mail?

28:24.130 --> 28:25.165
Nothing. It's something here.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.020
Alicia, you offered Finn the job

28:27.070 --> 28:29.095
because you like him and he's
maybe even a good lawyer,

28:29.140 --> 28:31.131
but he doesn't do anything
important for you.
You mean

28:31.170 --> 28:33.309
he doesn't do anything
important for you.
DAVID: Next time

28:33.340 --> 28:35.001
say it to my face, jackass.
Oh, but I have

28:35.040 --> 28:36.803
said it to your
face, Blanche,

28:36.840 --> 28:39.343
I have said it to your face.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.439
DAVID:
Stupid son of a bitch.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.141
Everything all right here?

28:43.180 --> 28:44.283
It's a long story.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.344
Giving Finn the job

28:45.390 --> 28:47.415
will be seen
as a slap in the face

28:47.450 --> 28:49.509
by every senior attorney
in your office

28:49.560 --> 28:51.323
who was passed over.
Every woman. Every...

28:51.360 --> 28:52.850
(whispers):
African-American.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.354
Where are you going?
Out.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.492
HOWELL:
I'm a

28:58.530 --> 29:00.168
superstar, Kalinda, uh,

29:00.200 --> 29:01.428
but one thing I can't do

29:01.470 --> 29:04.064
is track a hack
back to a hacker.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.362
Okay, but you can identify the
LP. addresses they're using.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.275
Sure, but they're
just false fronts.

29:08.310 --> 29:09.777
They bounce around a thousand
different servers,

29:09.810 --> 29:12.870
and every one of
them is anonymized.
(sighs)

29:12.910 --> 29:16.311
So there's nothing we can do?

29:16.350 --> 29:18.215
This is a hacker

29:18.250 --> 29:20.411
chat room. Read some
of these messages.

29:20.450 --> 29:22.816
"This law firm
needs to be punished!"

29:22.860 --> 29:25.556
"Time for some A.P.T."?
Advanced

29:25.590 --> 29:27.922
Persistent Threat.
Oh.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.554
"Dox-p, anyone?"
Right. The thing
is, there's no way

29:30.600 --> 29:34.138
to know if this is all just
angry talk, or if any of this

29:34.170 --> 29:35.990
is real.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.099
Or maybe there is.

29:38.140 --> 29:39.801
"What they're

29:39.840 --> 29:42.570
"doing to me is a blow against
freedom for all of us.

29:42.610 --> 29:45.249
"Today it's Wharfmaster.
Tomorrow,

29:45.280 --> 29:46.440
who knows?"
Nathan was
complaining,

29:46.480 --> 29:48.311
not stirring anything up.

29:48.350 --> 29:49.419
I believe it's called
free speech.

29:49.450 --> 29:51.589
It's called
intimidation.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.281
Your client incited hackers
to attack us

29:53.320 --> 29:54.958
to get us to back off.
You know, we

29:54.990 --> 29:56.514
could settle this
right now

29:56.560 --> 29:58.448
and make all your
problems go away.

29:58.490 --> 29:59.980
You have incredible
chutzpah, Jared.

30:00.030 --> 30:02.919
No, Diane,
I have a winning case.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.496
Well, you and your case
can go to hell.

30:04.530 --> 30:06.464
You lived there for a year?
Six months

30:06.500 --> 30:08.468
on a kibbutz, six
months in Jerusalem.
What was

30:08.500 --> 30:11.037
Israel like?
Hot.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.004
Do you think
I'd like living there?

30:13.040 --> 30:15.270
No.
'Cause I'm Christian?

30:15.310 --> 30:16.971
No, there are a ton
of Christians there,

30:17.010 --> 30:18.978
all with cameras.
Because it's hot.

30:19.010 --> 30:21.513
You spent a year living
where it all began.

30:21.550 --> 30:24.348
You must have felt, like,
I don't know-- inspired.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.312
No, just hot.
(door closes)

30:26.350 --> 30:29.217
And gassy. You eat
a lot of falafel.
(chuckles)

30:33.260 --> 30:36.491
Marissa's trying to convince me
to not live in Israel.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.589
Really?

30:38.630 --> 30:42.066
Hey, Grace, can you give
me and Marissa a moment?

30:42.100 --> 30:45.137
Yeah. Just let me know
when you want to eat.
Okay.

30:45.170 --> 30:46.637
The e-mails?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.604
Yeah. I went through
about 5,000.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.473
(door closes)

30:51.510 --> 30:53.171
How bad?

30:53.210 --> 30:55.542
Well, there's one where
you call a donor "the worst

30:55.580 --> 30:58.640
kind of sexist pig--
a pompous sexist pig."

30:58.690 --> 31:01.386
Another where you tell
Cary Agos that Finn Polmar

31:01.420 --> 31:04.389
is "soft and malleable with
a spine of cottage cheese."

31:04.430 --> 31:08.127
I was trying to buck Cary
up during his trial.
At the bottom

31:08.160 --> 31:10.094
is one from your gynecologist.

31:10.130 --> 31:13.520
It's your question about the
reliability of pregnancy tests.

31:13.570 --> 31:16.266
I was late.
Hey,

31:16.300 --> 31:19.007
I'm just the messenger.
Okay, so...

31:19.040 --> 31:22.009
these aren't good,
but they're not overly awful.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.076
Um... those are just
the ones I marked

31:24.110 --> 31:27.147
questionable. These are
the ones I marked bad.

31:27.180 --> 31:29.444
I highlighted
them in red.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.141
This one's from
Will Gardner

31:31.190 --> 31:33.146
right after some
New York conference.

31:33.190 --> 31:34.657
He talks about
you two.

31:34.690 --> 31:36.419
Oh, my God.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.087
Yeah.

31:38.130 --> 31:41.156
And... this one
was kind of unexpected.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.293
"Relax. It was just
a one-night stand,

31:43.330 --> 31:46.094
albeit a great one."
That was from
you to Elfman.

31:46.130 --> 31:48.098
But how did this
even get in... here?

31:48.140 --> 31:51.132
I... I never wrote_Jon
from my campaign
or my work e-mail.

31:51.170 --> 31:53.661
You probably toggled
the wrong account.

31:53.710 --> 31:55.598
It was quaint.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.575
You don't really see "albeit"
in too many e-mails.

31:58.610 --> 32:01.408
What am I gonna do?

32:01.450 --> 32:03.941
Stop these e-mails
from getting out there.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.287
How?

32:08.720 --> 32:11.086
Braden v. Campbell-- punitives
for invasion of privacy

32:11.130 --> 32:14.998
stemming from the unauthorized
publication of a diary.

32:15.030 --> 32:18.466
So we argue every e-mail
hacked is like a diary entry.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.297
ALICIA:
No.

32:20.330 --> 32:22.230
You have to settle this.

32:22.270 --> 32:24.636
The firm's reputation
can't handle another dump.

32:24.670 --> 32:27.605
The firm reputation,
Ms. State's Attorney?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.005
You_r e-mails were
noticeably absent

32:29.040 --> 32:30.234
from the first dump,
Alicia.

32:31.510 --> 32:33.501
You're going to clean that up!

32:33.550 --> 32:36.678
Our interests are aligned here.
Respectfully,

32:36.720 --> 32:38.585
Alicia, our interests
have not been aligned

32:38.620 --> 32:41.157
since you used our office
as a staging ground for your

32:41.190 --> 32:43.613
political career.
Have you read
the last two years of e-mails?

32:43.660 --> 32:46.527
This one's from
Will to me,

32:46.560 --> 32:48.198
November 12, 2013.

32:48.230 --> 32:50.551
"Alicia, can you meet
with Sweeney tomorrow at 3:00?

32:50.600 --> 32:54.730
Our favorite wife-killing psycho
has requested your presence."

32:54.770 --> 32:58.262
Diane, this one's from you.
Monday, June 3, 2013.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.608
"Let's huddle about
the Connolly billings.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.507
"I want to head that
geriatric blimp off

33:03.540 --> 33:04.768
at the pass."

33:04.810 --> 33:07.244
Yes.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.747
We need to settle.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.316
Now.

33:10.350 --> 33:12.784
No.
Mr. Dalton,
$500,000

33:12.820 --> 33:14.515
at least gives you something.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.118
It's a drop in the bucket
for Wharfmaster.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.321
I want that arrogant
son of a bitch out of business.

33:19.390 --> 33:20.618
Well, then
at this time,

33:20.660 --> 33:22.355
we need to notify
you that we are

33:22.400 --> 33:23.526
withdrawing as
your counsel.

33:23.560 --> 33:24.788
What?
Given the damage

33:24.830 --> 33:26.798
we've already incurred
from that hack,

33:26.830 --> 33:28.536
_ we can't_continue_
in an effective capaCIty.

33:28.570 --> 33:31.300
But we can refer
you to a number of
excellent law firms.

33:31.340 --> 33:33.365
You think a single one
would take me on after
what happened to you?

33:33.410 --> 33:34.809
We're stuck with each other,
Ms. Lockhart.
Mr. Dalton,

33:34.840 --> 33:36.637
our_ firm is
undergomg a catas...
No. Listen,

33:36.680 --> 33:38.545
you undertook
an obligation to represent me.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.002
Now, you're going to fulfill it.

33:42.550 --> 33:45.519
Or we can ask the judge
what he thinks.

33:45.550 --> 33:46.812
(sighs)

33:46.850 --> 33:48.659
ELI:
Oh, my God.

33:48.690 --> 33:51.784
Oh, my God!

33:51.830 --> 33:53.354
Oh, my...
Eli.

33:53.390 --> 33:55.153
Would you please
stop saying that?

33:55.200 --> 33:57.156
Phone sex?
It was two
years ago.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.565
MARISSA:
Question is,

33:58.600 --> 33:59.567
what do we do, Dad?

33:59.600 --> 34:01.295
These aren't out yet?
No,

34:01.340 --> 34:02.830
the threat is that
they'll get dumped today,

34:02.870 --> 34:04.735
and the question is,
do I apologize

34:04.770 --> 34:06.067
to people beforehand?
No.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.759
Never apologize beforehand.

34:07.810 --> 34:09.573
You never know
what's gonna happen.
I disagree.

34:09.610 --> 34:10.679
Well, bully for you.
When you have

34:10.710 --> 34:12.143
more than _
four months' experience,

34:12.180 --> 34:13.602
come back and we'll listen.

34:13.650 --> 34:15.311
In the real world,
where real people live,

34:15.350 --> 34:17.215
not politicians, there's
something to be said

34:17.250 --> 34:19.684
for preparing a client to
hear that you called them

34:19.720 --> 34:21.278
an "arrogant,
sweaty misanthrope."

34:21.320 --> 34:22.856
You put that in an e-mail?

34:22.890 --> 34:25.586
Look, it's a corollary
to the never-say-no principle.

34:25.630 --> 34:29.396
Always best to do nothing when
you don't have to do anything.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.125
It shows
con5ideration.
It shows weakness.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.730
And most importantly,
it may not happen.

34:33.770 --> 34:35.590
Excuse me.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.268
No. No. Whatever
you're gonna do, no.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.663
ALICIA:
I'm sorry.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.769
What for? _
For an e-mail

34:41.810 --> 34:44.199
I sent about you.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.599
What e-mail?

34:46.650 --> 34:49.312
I said you were soft...
and malleable,

34:49.350 --> 34:51.341
with a spine
like cottage cheese.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.483
Cottage cheese?
It was during
Cary's trial,

34:53.520 --> 34:55.886
when everything
was getting crazy.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.649
And did you believe it?

34:57.690 --> 34:59.624
No. No.
Alicia, if
you're looking

34:59.660 --> 35:01.821
to rescind the offer to
be your chief deputy...
What?

35:01.860 --> 35:04.420
No. I mean,
this whole thing is... it...

35:04.470 --> 35:06.859
Of course
the offer still stands.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.765
Okay, then.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.763
Bygones.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.368
Really?

35:14.410 --> 35:15.308
Sure.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.672
ALICIA:
Mr. Bishop.

35:20.710 --> 35:22.519
Hello.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.848
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.211
Shall we go up
to my office?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.650
No. Here's fine.

35:30.890 --> 35:32.221
You're probably right

35:32.260 --> 35:34.728
about the PAC information
not hurting you.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.296
Let's go upstairs.

35:36.330 --> 35:37.399
No.

35:37.430 --> 35:38.897
But I did give
my captains

35:38.930 --> 35:40.591
walking-around money

35:40.630 --> 35:43.758
to get the vote out in the
African-American communities.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.303
You know, the communities
where you were weak.

35:46.340 --> 35:49.798
I didn't ask you
to do that, sir.
It gets a bit confusing

35:49.840 --> 35:52.206
about who asked who to do what.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.218
That's my
impression, anyway.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.740
So maybe you
should think about

35:55.780 --> 35:57.839
the Geneva Pine investigation.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.512
Okay?

36:01.960 --> 36:04.849
Thank you for your thoughts,
Mr. Bishop.

36:04.890 --> 36:06.858
All options are open to me,

36:06.890 --> 36:09.791
and I plan to decide
in the next 48 hours.

36:09.830 --> 36:13.869
Good. Then I'll sit tight
and wait to hear from you.

36:15.900 --> 36:16.798
I appreciate your openness.

36:16.840 --> 36:30.811
*

36:30.850 --> 36:33.614
(angry, overlapping chatter)

36:39.730 --> 36:42.858
You know, I sense
something between us.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.460
Want to grab some
dinner one night? Huh?

36:49.540 --> 36:52.464
Please tell me you've made
some headway on these hackers.

36:52.510 --> 36:55.536
No, but I may have found
something on Nathan Bacevich.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.378
Remember he said that
he saw In Brain when
it first came out?

36:58.410 --> 36:59.877
Yes, and wasn't impressed.

36:59.910 --> 37:02.276
Yeah. But it was
only in the US. theaters

37:02.320 --> 37:04.288
from February 5 through March 6.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.448
Bacevich was in Europe
promoting Wharfmaster.

37:07.490 --> 37:09.981
So where did he watch it?

37:10.020 --> 37:12.659
You used your own site
to download it, illegally,

37:12.690 --> 37:17.354
despite your repeated
denials that you and your
Web site knowingly violated

37:17.400 --> 37:18.765
copyright infringement laws.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.495
Congratulations,
Mr. Bacevich.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.634
You lied under oath
and can now be prosecuted

37:22.670 --> 37:23.989
for perjury.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.598
DIANE: We have enough
to win this, Nathan,

37:25.640 --> 37:26.800
and your attorney
knows that.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.432
And if we press
the perjury charge,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.436
you could go to prison.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.607
We will go as low
as $15 million.

37:32.650 --> 37:35.642
(takes deep breath)

37:35.680 --> 37:39.411
Here's the only deal
we'll agree to.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.509
An apology...

37:41.560 --> 37:42.982
from Mr. Dalton

37:43.020 --> 37:44.851
for bringing a
frivolous lawsuit

37:44.890 --> 37:46.778
to Mr. Bacevich.
CARY:
What the hell?

37:46.830 --> 37:49.549
I'm sorry, are we in
upside-down land here?
DIANE: Excuse me?

37:49.600 --> 37:50.953
ANDREWS:
No, Sir.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.525
We are very much
right-side up,

37:53.570 --> 37:56.368
and the view
is very clear.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.039
You have two hours,
or the deal is off the table.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.560
This is disgusting!
It's the triumph
of the anarchists.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.339
No, it isn't.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.904
You know, the next killer app

38:03.940 --> 38:05.771
isn't coming
from some corporate office

38:05.810 --> 38:09.314
in Seattle or San Jose, it's
coming from some 16-year-old

38:09.350 --> 38:12.410
in Warsaw who gets excited
by a 14-year-old's
code in Mumbai.

38:12.450 --> 38:15.351
You obsess so much
about copyright and DRMs,

38:15.390 --> 38:17.585
you're missing what's great
about what's going on.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.827
You're building fences,
and we're trying
to tear them all down,

38:19.860 --> 38:21.521
not because we hate you,

38:21.560 --> 38:24.393
but because we're trying
to build the next big thing.

38:24.430 --> 38:25.966
Let us do it.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.798
Because it's gonna happen
either way.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.862
(door closes)
Take the deal.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.878
Um, excuse me?

38:35.910 --> 38:37.707
We are winning
this, sir.

38:37.740 --> 38:39.378
No, we're not.

38:39.410 --> 38:41.549
My company's e-mails
were just hacked, too.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.411
(Diane sighs)

38:46.620 --> 38:48.713
Take... the deal.

38:51.990 --> 38:53.878
(sighs)

38:53.930 --> 38:55.921
*

39:04.670 --> 39:06.638
If the hacker or hackers

39:10.840 --> 39:12.444
they sure succeeded.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.471
Wildly.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.942
So...

39:20.690 --> 39:23.488
...I think an apology's
in order.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.685
From whom to whom?

39:29.030 --> 39:31.021
Take your pick.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.831
(chuckles)

39:34.870 --> 39:36.497
I was blowing off steam.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.031
Yes, you were
pigheaded,

39:39.070 --> 39:43.177
belligerent, and arrogant
to the extreme...

39:43.210 --> 39:45.701
but you're, uh...
(clears throat)

39:45.750 --> 39:48.446
you're also a hell
of a lawyer.

39:51.020 --> 39:52.840
A fruitcake?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.858
CARY:
We settled
the Wharfmaster case.

39:54.890 --> 39:56.858
(relieved sigh)

39:56.890 --> 39:58.858
Thank you.

39:58.890 --> 40:01.120
Yeah. Let the bad guys win.

40:01.160 --> 40:05.028
Well, it was the only
move, which means it
was the smart move.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.061
It's not a pretty picture

40:07.100 --> 40:09.568
when you see what people
really think of you.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.728
I don't think it is, really,
what people think of you.

40:12.770 --> 40:14.829
I think sometimes
you just have to...

40:14.880 --> 40:17.007
let off steam, say
something nasty.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.713
Sometimes.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.718
POLMAR:
Is this a joke?

40:23.750 --> 40:26.048
$100,000 total?
That is a quarter million

40:26.090 --> 40:27.614
below your initial offer.

40:27.650 --> 40:30.016
This hack has been
a game changer.

40:30.060 --> 40:33.552
We have to buy a whole
new computer network
and e-mail system.

40:33.590 --> 40:36.457
Not to mention new laptops,
cell phones, iPads.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.718
There's nothing
more to give.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.169
Alicia...

40:40.200 --> 40:42.964
you should take it.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.732
I'll consider it.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.078
And I want you
all to know...

40:51.110 --> 40:54.739
that this offer does
not in any way

40:54.780 --> 40:57.078
impact my consideration
of your criminal cases

40:57.120 --> 40:59.213
when I'm SA.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.822
Was that a thinly
veiled threat?

41:09.860 --> 41:12.829
(sighs): Nope.
Very clear one.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.269
She wouldn't dare.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.894
You want to chance it?

41:20.540 --> 41:22.508
So, are you safe?

41:22.540 --> 41:24.178
For the moment, yes.

41:24.210 --> 41:26.849
And Redmayne and Castro
are satisfied?

41:26.880 --> 41:28.711
Happy days.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.541
So, what did we learn?

41:32.590 --> 41:33.887
Hell ifI know.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.286
Go slow, choose carefully.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.015
Right.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.028
Do you know Neil Sands?

41:40.060 --> 41:41.891
Do I... No.
He's a lawyer

41:41.930 --> 41:43.227
over at Justice.
African-American.

41:43.260 --> 41:45.660
Dad was a cop.
He is by all accounts

41:45.700 --> 41:46.997
a topnotch attorney.

41:47.030 --> 41:48.691
He'd be a great number two.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.037
What do you think?

41:53.040 --> 41:55.679
Thank you for
your advice, Eli.

41:55.710 --> 41:57.837
All options are
open to me,

41:57.880 --> 42:01.099
and I plan to decide
in 48 hours.
