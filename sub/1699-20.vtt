WEBVTT

00:08.885 --> 00:09.851
Oh, look.

00:09.852 --> 00:11.924
It's the perfect Sunday morning.

00:11.925 --> 00:13.493
Dad's making waffles.

00:13.494 --> 00:15.750
Mom's squeezing
fresh orange juice, and...

00:15.751 --> 00:17.620
well, Corey's still living here.

00:17.621 --> 00:18.891
Almost perfect.

00:18.892 --> 00:19.998
I know, Lionel.

00:19.999 --> 00:21.147
She's mean.

00:22.759 --> 00:23.635
What?

00:24.585 --> 00:26.184
He thinks you're ugly, too.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.013
Corey, in the cage.

00:29.014 --> 00:30.444
You, not the rat.

00:32.024 --> 00:33.160
What's up, folks?

00:33.161 --> 00:34.592
Your houseguest
has arrived.

00:34.593 --> 00:35.617
Hey, Eddie.

00:36.164 --> 00:37.787
So, Eddie what kind
of waffles do you want?

00:37.788 --> 00:41.107
We got blueberry, boysenberry

00:41.108 --> 00:42.393
raspberry

00:42.394 --> 00:44.132
and strawberry.

00:44.133 --> 00:47.500
Okay. Well, uh,
how about Halle Berry?

00:49.619 --> 00:50.943
Don't hurt nobody.

00:50.944 --> 00:52.457
Shake it up,
shake it up.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.495
So, uh, you're just going
to have the plain waffle?

00:59.496 --> 01:00.703
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

01:02.202 --> 01:03.745
Oh, my mom told me
to tell you guys

01:03.746 --> 01:05.078
thanks again
for letting me stay here

01:05.078 --> 01:06.781
while she's
at her dental conference.

01:06.782 --> 01:08.151
It's the least we can do.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.326
She takes care
of our teeth.

01:09.327 --> 01:10.095
We take care

01:10.096 --> 01:10.796
of her son.

01:10.797 --> 01:12.264
You're family.

01:12.265 --> 01:13.581
Did you bring
the free toothpaste?

01:13.582 --> 01:14.962
Yeah.

01:14.963 --> 01:16.093
Got it.

01:16.094 --> 01:17.858
Why don't you
take your stuff upstairs

01:17.859 --> 01:19.831
and when you come back down,
you can have breakfast.

01:19.832 --> 01:21.106
You're going to be staying
in Corey's room.

01:21.107 --> 01:22.576
Okay.
What?

01:22.577 --> 01:23.601
No way!

01:23.602 --> 01:24.854
Corey...

01:25.494 --> 01:26.477
Fine.

01:27.103 --> 01:29.711
But if you cut the cheese
one time...

01:30.177 --> 01:31.681
you're sleeping on the couch.

01:32.244 --> 01:33.646
Man.

01:34.241 --> 01:35.523
Well, aren't you glad

01:35.524 --> 01:37.231
you're staying
with my loving family?

01:42.825 --> 01:43.791
That's it, Tonya.

01:43.792 --> 01:44.884
I can't take this anymore.

01:44.885 --> 01:46.028
We're going to have
to split up.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.582 --> 02:40.915
Yep, that's me.

02:50.185 --> 02:51.444
Oh, no, no.

02:51.445 --> 02:54.019
Now let me explain
the rules of the my room.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.768
No gels, no smells.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.775
No sprays.

02:58.776 --> 02:59.783
No mouth...

03:00.453 --> 03:02.403
mouthwash.

03:03.815 --> 03:05.080
You should keep that.

03:07.034 --> 03:08.038
Look, is he going

03:08.039 --> 03:09.171
to be staying in here?

03:09.715 --> 03:12.889
That's the same thing
Lionel just said about you.

03:14.556 --> 03:16.525
Corey, I need to speak
to Eddie alone.

03:18.116 --> 03:19.663
Excuse me?

03:20.356 --> 03:22.131
This is my room.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.014
Oh, that's right.

03:24.015 --> 03:25.750
Boy, and there is something
so cool

03:25.751 --> 03:26.362
about your room.

03:26.363 --> 03:27.502
Come here.
Let me show you.

03:27.883 --> 03:29.249
You're going to love it.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.423
Look, stand out there.

03:30.424 --> 03:31.524
Ready? Ready, ready?

03:31.525 --> 03:32.715
Ready? Look, ready?

03:32.716 --> 03:34.011
It locks.

03:37.115 --> 03:38.552
Eddie, I am freaking out.

03:38.553 --> 03:39.326
I just had a vision

03:39.327 --> 03:41.004
my parents are going
to split up.

03:42.084 --> 03:43.240
Your parents?

03:43.814 --> 03:44.650
They're the last people

03:44.651 --> 03:46.060
I thought
would ever get a divorce.

03:46.061 --> 03:47.134
I know.

03:47.135 --> 03:49.432
And I mean, they hardly
every argue that much.

03:49.433 --> 03:51.824
Hey, my parents never argued
either

03:52.461 --> 03:53.928
so, I never saw it coming.

03:54.825 --> 03:56.014
But you did.

03:56.015 --> 03:57.954
So, you still have time
to do something.

03:57.955 --> 03:58.813
And I'll help you.

03:58.814 --> 03:59.443
I'm listening.

03:59.444 --> 04:00.192
Okay.

04:00.515 --> 04:02.111
Well, there's always
little signs

04:02.112 --> 04:04.265
when people are thinking
about getting a divorce.

04:04.266 --> 04:07.115
Like, you know, how your parents
are all happy and stuff?

04:07.116 --> 04:07.807
Yeah.

04:07.808 --> 04:08.824
That's got to stop.

04:09.305 --> 04:10.909
They're just holding in
all that anger.

04:11.506 --> 04:12.959
Well, you think?

04:13.779 --> 04:15.005
Eddie, I don't know.

04:16.176 --> 04:17.877
I think I might need
a second opinion.

04:21.197 --> 04:23.934
Well, Raven, you have come
to the right person

04:23.935 --> 04:25.418
because both my parents
are therapists

04:25.419 --> 04:26.215
and I can tell you, like

04:26.216 --> 04:28.049
anything you want to know
about relationships.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.385
Okay, so what does it mean...?

04:29.386 --> 04:30.684
Time's up. See you next week.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.585
I totally...

04:38.354 --> 04:40.035
Here's what I've been thinking.

04:40.036 --> 04:41.893
Maybe Rae's parents are
going to break up

04:41.894 --> 04:43.942
because they haven't been
spending enough time together.

04:43.943 --> 04:45.673
I mean, that's what happened
to my parents.

04:45.674 --> 04:47.793
Yes. That's a good point, Eddie.

04:47.794 --> 04:49.450
A successful marriage is one

04:49.451 --> 04:52.476
that coexists with equality
and mutual respect.

04:52.477 --> 04:56.105
A couple should unselfishly
put aside the "I"

04:56.620 --> 04:59.485
and make for time for the "we."

04:59.888 --> 05:03.280
'Cause you can't spell
"we" with an "i."

05:05.485 --> 05:07.626
You spell "insane" with an "i."

05:09.596 --> 05:10.405
So, maybe I
just need

05:10.406 --> 05:11.719
to get my parents to
spend more time together.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.133
Exactly.
Yes, yes, yes.

05:13.134 --> 05:13.835
They call that

05:13.836 --> 05:15.206
"creating a safe place

05:15.207 --> 05:16.972
for the we to grow."

05:17.378 --> 05:18.981
And to blossom.

05:23.221 --> 05:26.222
We call that
the "us" shutting up

05:26.223 --> 05:27.100
the "you."

05:39.816 --> 05:42.457
Hey, Mom, what are
you doing down here

05:42.458 --> 05:44.123
all alone in
the quiet?

05:44.705 --> 05:46.837
Being all alone
in the quiet.

05:48.955 --> 05:50.969
But that's all over now,
isn't it?

05:51.774 --> 05:53.649
You know what else
is good reading, Mom?

05:53.650 --> 05:55.125
A cookbook

05:55.126 --> 05:56.965
which is in the kitchen with Dad

05:56.966 --> 05:58.585
and I'm sure
he'd love for you

05:58.586 --> 05:59.930
to spend some more
time with him.

05:59.931 --> 06:00.894
Really?
Yup.

06:00.895 --> 06:02.146
He never told
me that.

06:02.147 --> 06:03.513
Did-did he
tell you that?

06:05.096 --> 06:07.679
Well, um, kind of sort of.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.331
Not really.

06:08.332 --> 06:09.511
Okay, buh-bye.

06:12.415 --> 06:13.484
Hey, hon.

06:13.485 --> 06:15.532
Need some help
cutting those veggies?

06:15.533 --> 06:17.158
Sure. Love some.

06:21.591 --> 06:22.447
There you go.

06:22.448 --> 06:23.516
Thank you.

06:26.445 --> 06:27.897
Look at us.

06:27.898 --> 06:29.637
Cutting together.

06:30.245 --> 06:31.934
Reminds me of when
I was little

06:31.935 --> 06:32.625
and I used to help

06:32.626 --> 06:34.410
Great Grandma Izzetta
in the kitchen.

06:35.123 --> 06:36.355
She'd always say

06:36.356 --> 06:37.804
"I don't believe in all that

06:37.805 --> 06:39.633
"fancy weighing and measuring.

06:39.634 --> 06:40.950
"Just throw it all in.

06:40.951 --> 06:42.031
It'll chew."

06:42.818 --> 06:43.875
How would she know?

06:43.876 --> 06:45.002
She didn't have no teeth.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.943
"I came
in this world with no teeth

06:47.944 --> 06:50.780
and I'm going out the same way."

06:53.315 --> 06:54.449
What's going on?

06:54.450 --> 06:55.243
Take a look.

06:55.244 --> 06:56.769
They are spending time together.

06:56.770 --> 06:58.619
No way are they going
to get a divorce.

06:58.620 --> 06:59.986
Oh, okay.

07:00.485 --> 07:02.545
And I say, "Grandma Izzetta

07:02.546 --> 07:05.285
you don't wear your teeth,
you don't wear your bra."

07:05.286 --> 07:06.045
And she said

07:06.046 --> 07:07.920
"Child, I'm 92.

07:07.921 --> 07:10.035
Trust me, nobody lookin'."

07:14.814 --> 07:16.674
Where's your
wedding ring?

07:17.745 --> 07:21.175
Oh, um, you know I don't like
to wear it when I cook

07:21.176 --> 07:25.057
'cause it always gets
junked up with food and stuff.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.009
Victor, it's not
just when you cook.

07:30.010 --> 07:31.448
You don't wear it
when you shower

07:31.449 --> 07:32.548
when you take
out the garbage.

07:32.549 --> 07:34.786
Baby, I'm sure
it'll show up someplace.

07:40.875 --> 07:41.784
How do you know

07:41.785 --> 07:43.896
you didn't just bake it
into that cake or something?

07:43.897 --> 07:46.946
Tonya, I'm a professional chef.
I don't make mistakes like that.

07:46.947 --> 07:47.928
Just forget it.

07:47.929 --> 07:49.879
The ring is a symbol
of our marriage

07:49.880 --> 07:51.761
and you treat it
like it's nothing.

08:08.455 --> 08:09.755
Man, it's too bad

08:09.756 --> 08:11.546
your parents had that
fight last night.

08:11.547 --> 08:12.918
That cake was looking good.

08:12.919 --> 08:16.019
How can they get divorced
over a missing ring?

08:16.020 --> 08:17.414
It hasn't happened yet.

08:17.415 --> 08:19.479
You still have time
to change the future.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.219
You just got
to stay positive, Rae.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.480
Positive?

08:23.366 --> 08:24.972
I don't know if I can,
you know.

08:24.973 --> 08:26.923
I just can't fake something
like that.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.160
Morning, sunshines.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.615
Who's going to have
a good day today?

08:40.475 --> 08:41.440
We are.

08:45.296 --> 08:46.841
I said positive, Rae--

08:46.842 --> 08:48.041
not psycho.

08:50.645 --> 08:52.419
Hey, has anybody seen Lionel?

08:52.420 --> 08:53.636
He got out again.

08:53.637 --> 08:54.784
Ask your father.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.291
He knows all about things
getting lost.

08:58.197 --> 08:59.682
Is this coffee bitter?

09:00.979 --> 09:02.044
No.

09:02.445 --> 09:03.785
Must be you.

09:05.185 --> 09:07.093
Hey, now. Hey.

09:07.094 --> 09:10.319
Now, why don't I make us
all a loving

09:10.320 --> 09:12.515
family breakfast?

09:13.163 --> 09:14.418
I'm not hungry.

09:14.419 --> 09:15.844
Neither am I.

09:15.845 --> 09:17.427
I am. Two eggs over easy.

09:17.966 --> 09:19.114
Okay.

09:21.849 --> 09:23.020
Dig in.

09:27.785 --> 09:29.806
Kids, I'm going
to take you to school.

09:30.410 --> 09:31.954
I'll be waiting in my car.

09:31.955 --> 09:33.776
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:33.777 --> 09:35.352
I'm taking the kids to school.

09:35.353 --> 09:37.045
I'll be waiting in my car.

09:43.615 --> 09:45.245
Eddie, what do I do?

09:45.906 --> 09:46.743
Well...

09:46.744 --> 09:48.126
there's only one thing
you can do.

09:48.537 --> 09:49.738
Little thing.

09:49.739 --> 09:51.245
How fast can you break your leg?

09:56.785 --> 09:58.777
Okay, this is
never going to work.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.598
I'm telling you, Rae,
when I broke my leg

10:01.599 --> 10:03.279
my parents forgot all
about their problems

10:03.280 --> 10:04.713
and focused
their attention on me.

10:04.714 --> 10:06.060
It really brought them together.

10:06.953 --> 10:09.095
Okay, well, Chelsea, you really
have to make it look

10:09.096 --> 10:10.100
like it's in a cast.

10:10.101 --> 10:11.066
Hey, Rae?

10:11.621 --> 10:13.392
Why doesn't your leg
just audition

10:13.393 --> 10:14.660
for the school play?

10:14.661 --> 10:16.735
'Cause then it'll be in a cast.

10:16.736 --> 10:18.321
Get it?

10:19.256 --> 10:21.553
A cast,
like a cast.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.802
Isn't that funny?

10:25.275 --> 10:26.437
No.

10:28.415 --> 10:29.481
You know what?

10:29.482 --> 10:31.075
My parents are really angry.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.715
Maybe I just need
to break one more thing.

10:45.537 --> 10:46.715
Okay, there's the wall.

10:48.145 --> 10:50.555
This should keep them together
for years.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.245
Sorry, Mr. Simpson.

10:57.978 --> 10:59.085
Hey, girl.

11:00.415 --> 11:02.629
Oh, girl.
Oh, I'm so sorry...

11:07.999 --> 11:10.495
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:10.496 --> 11:11.858
Look. Oh, can't help you.

11:14.144 --> 11:15.660
Eddie, there's a banner.

11:15.661 --> 11:16.627
Eddie,
there's a ban...

11:16.628 --> 11:18.541
Eddie, there's a banner!

11:30.209 --> 11:31.375
I'm telling you,
Rae

11:31.376 --> 11:32.804
when your parents
see you like this

11:32.805 --> 11:34.296
they're going to freak.

11:34.297 --> 11:35.380
Yeah, Rae,
I mean

11:35.381 --> 11:35.861
they're going to be

11:35.862 --> 11:37.480
up all night
worrying about you.

11:37.481 --> 11:39.521
They won't be able
to, like, sleep or eat.

11:39.522 --> 11:40.649
I mean, their lives
are going to be

11:40.650 --> 11:43.203
this bottomless pit of misery
until you get better.

11:43.204 --> 11:44.801
Promise?

11:45.361 --> 11:46.444
Absolutely.

11:46.445 --> 11:47.558
They're going
to come back together.

11:47.559 --> 11:49.115
We'll be upstairs.

11:57.015 --> 11:58.781
Hi, Dad. Hi...

11:59.301 --> 12:02.350
Hey, Lionel.
What are you doing here?

12:02.351 --> 12:04.919
Lionel, you need to get
back in your cage, sweetie.

12:04.920 --> 12:04.875
What are you doing, Lionel?

12:06.413 --> 12:08.443
Li...Li... Lionel?

12:09.324 --> 12:10.449
Lionel, get out of there.

12:10.450 --> 12:11.635
Lionel, no.

12:11.636 --> 12:13.327
Lionel, stop it! Get out!

12:13.328 --> 12:15.451
No! Lionel!

12:16.210 --> 12:18.219
Lionel, stop it.

12:18.220 --> 12:22.352
No, no. No!

12:25.145 --> 12:26.869
Get out of...

12:34.067 --> 12:35.827
Oh, man.

12:37.441 --> 12:40.657
No, I said I was
going to pick him up.

12:40.658 --> 12:42.064
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

12:47.536 --> 12:49.846
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

12:51.102 --> 12:52.378
I'm fine.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.884
What happened to you?

12:58.885 --> 13:01.014
Oh, well at least
somebody cares.

13:01.015 --> 13:04.176
I was trying to help people out
and see, and then...

13:05.170 --> 13:07.399
Did the bad lady hurt you?

13:16.515 --> 13:18.579
I love this picture
of me and my folks.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.885
Don't we look happy?

13:20.616 --> 13:21.844
Where's Corey?

13:21.845 --> 13:23.007
Oh, he wasn't born yet.

13:23.008 --> 13:24.260
That's why we were so happy.

13:25.857 --> 13:26.495
You guys

13:26.496 --> 13:28.466
I'm never going to stop
this vision from happening.

13:28.869 --> 13:30.477
Oh, look, Rae.

13:30.478 --> 13:33.379
If it makes you feel better,
divorce isn't so bad.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.584
Check this out.

13:34.585 --> 13:37.606
I got two homes,
two bedrooms and two TVs.

13:37.906 --> 13:39.744
Of course, a brother's
got to make two beds

13:39.745 --> 13:40.673
but that's cool.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.095
Eddie, you're okay
with your parents

13:43.096 --> 13:44.197
not being together?

13:44.198 --> 13:47.155
No, but I
deal with it.

13:48.798 --> 13:50.853
And I still think
I could have stopped it.

13:53.115 --> 13:54.994
Oh, you guys,
look at this one.

13:54.995 --> 13:56.540
Mom and Dad
at country-western bar.

13:56.541 --> 13:57.898
It was their first date.

13:58.285 --> 14:01.847
Oh, gosh,
they were so happy.

14:04.585 --> 14:06.014
And still are.

14:06.015 --> 14:08.713
Yes, and will be,
uh-huh.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.705
And, and, and...
please stop me.

14:10.706 --> 14:12.673
Oh, no, Chelsea,
that's a great idea.

14:12.674 --> 14:14.445
All we have to do
is remind these two people

14:14.446 --> 14:16.361
how much they still
love each other.

14:17.028 --> 14:17.944
Yeah.

14:23.285 --> 14:24.784
What are you
doing home so early?

14:24.785 --> 14:27.149
I got a message from Rae.
She said to get home right away.

14:27.150 --> 14:28.657
She left me the same message
on my cell.

14:28.658 --> 14:29.664
Do you have your key?

14:30.267 --> 14:33.219
Why? Did you lose yours?

14:33.220 --> 14:35.016
Huh?
That's okay.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.737
Happens to all of us.

14:43.718 --> 14:46.234
Uh, what's going on
in here?

14:48.445 --> 14:50.311
Howdy do, folks.
Come on in.

14:50.312 --> 14:51.649
Eddie, what is...

14:51.650 --> 14:53.850
No, no, no time
for chitchat, missy.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.611
You come and take
a seat right here.

14:56.409 --> 14:57.867
Just like you did

14:57.868 --> 15:02.093
on the night
of June 23, 1983.

15:02.094 --> 15:03.471
When you were young...

15:03.988 --> 15:05.363
and in love.

15:06.293 --> 15:08.209
Whee, doggy!

15:10.762 --> 15:12.614
June 23rd...

15:12.615 --> 15:14.449
that was our first date.

15:14.450 --> 15:15.345
It was?

15:16.315 --> 15:17.218
It was.

15:18.682 --> 15:20.195
Hey, how 'bout
a little something

15:20.196 --> 15:21.251
to wet your whistle, huh?

15:21.675 --> 15:23.638
Hey, Jimmy Ray,
get on out here.

15:26.512 --> 15:28.781
Howdy, partner.
Evening, ma'am.

15:29.354 --> 15:31.557
Fine night for falling
in love, ain't it?

15:34.245 --> 15:36.546
Okay, where's your sister?

15:36.547 --> 15:38.812
Chelsea Mae, hit the lights.

15:44.837 --> 15:48.381
And now, without further ado

15:48.382 --> 15:50.219
introducing the little lady
with the big voice

15:50.220 --> 15:51.807
and even bigger hair.

15:52.445 --> 15:54.496
Put your hands together
for the queen of country music

15:54.497 --> 15:58.062
Mrs. Rodeo Raven, whoo!

16:04.105 --> 16:08.151
Hello, folks, and welcome
to Rusty's Bar and Grill

16:08.152 --> 16:12.779
located on I-94, right next
to Leanna's Hair Emporium

16:12.780 --> 16:16.468
where the bigger the hair,
the more we care.

16:19.915 --> 16:22.779
Are the memories of love
just flooding back?

16:22.780 --> 16:24.315
Flooding back.

16:27.685 --> 16:31.210
Anyway, here's a song for all
you first-daters out there.

16:31.211 --> 16:36.915
Remember when love was new and
you loved him and he loved you?

16:39.585 --> 16:40.849
# Stay together #

16:40.850 --> 16:42.044
# Stay together #

16:42.045 --> 16:43.782
# You two were meant to be #

16:43.783 --> 16:44.789
# Like white leather #

16:44.790 --> 16:45.890
# Like white leather #

16:45.891 --> 16:47.908
# On Elvis Presley #

16:47.909 --> 16:50.234
# 'Cause love is rare #

16:50.235 --> 16:52.050
# Time will prove it #

16:52.051 --> 16:53.945
# And like my hair #

16:53.946 --> 16:55.719
# You can't move it #

16:55.720 --> 16:56.732
# No, you can't #

16:56.733 --> 16:57.908
# Stay together #

16:57.909 --> 16:59.014
# Stay together #

16:59.015 --> 17:00.819
# Like chili and corn bread #

17:00.820 --> 17:01.878
# Love's forever #

17:01.879 --> 17:02.863
# Love's forever #

17:02.864 --> 17:04.904
# Absorb what I've said #

17:06.115 --> 17:07.465
# Remember this night #

17:08.183 --> 17:09.780
# Try not to fight #

17:10.465 --> 17:12.165
# And we'll be all right #

17:12.550 --> 17:13.579
# Stay together #

17:13.580 --> 17:14.695
# Stay together #

17:14.696 --> 17:17.491
# For the sake of the kids #

17:17.492 --> 17:18.694
# Stay together, please. #

17:21.693 --> 17:22.767
Thank you.

17:23.426 --> 17:25.271
You know what they're
trying to do, don't you?

17:25.780 --> 17:27.385
They want us
to stop fighting.

17:28.025 --> 17:29.930
And they want you
to apologize to me.

17:31.991 --> 17:33.133
Excuse me?

17:33.502 --> 17:34.610
One more time.

17:34.611 --> 17:35.678
# Stay together... #

17:35.679 --> 17:36.919
Rae, please.

17:37.253 --> 17:38.181
Now, look, baby

17:38.182 --> 17:39.614
we appreciate what
you're trying to do

17:39.615 --> 17:41.081
but you got to let
your mother and I

17:41.082 --> 17:42.681
work this out
amongst ourselves.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.164
There'd be nothing
to work out

17:45.165 --> 17:46.760
if you hadn't lost the ring
in the first place.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.879
That's it, Tonya.
I can't take this anymore.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.098
We're going to have to split up.

17:50.099 --> 17:51.500
Eddie, that was my vision.

17:51.501 --> 17:53.537
You look upstairs,
I'll look downstairs.

17:53.538 --> 17:55.307
One of us has got to find it.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.435
What?

17:56.436 --> 17:58.912
Um, uh, excuse me.

17:58.913 --> 17:59.974
I'm sorry.

17:59.975 --> 18:03.319
Um, you're not getting
a divorce?

18:03.320 --> 18:04.980
A divorce?
A divorce?

18:06.574 --> 18:10.245
See, I had a vision
of Dad saying "split up."

18:11.232 --> 18:12.560
So that's what I thought

18:12.561 --> 18:14.554
and I've been trying
to keep it from happening.

18:15.097 --> 18:17.854
Oh, honey, come here.

18:20.226 --> 18:21.111
Listen.

18:21.885 --> 18:25.337
Honey, your dad and I
are not getting a divorce.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.964
Not even close.

18:27.408 --> 18:28.866
Just because
we have an argument

18:28.867 --> 18:31.168
doesn't mean we're not
going to work things out.

18:31.169 --> 18:32.847
Yeah, baby,
you got to understand

18:32.848 --> 18:35.578
just because we disagree,
it's not your job to fix it.

18:35.579 --> 18:37.940
And that goes for you, too.

18:39.937 --> 18:41.284
Okay?

18:41.285 --> 18:42.349
Okay.
Okay.

18:42.350 --> 18:44.473
I'm glad that's over.

18:44.474 --> 18:46.360
This hat's messing up
a brother's 'fro.

18:46.361 --> 18:47.671
Oh, bizzle.

18:51.085 --> 18:52.766
Funny, I never
really thought

18:52.767 --> 18:54.845
you guys would be
into country western.

18:56.405 --> 18:57.701
Actually, we're not.

18:57.702 --> 19:00.507
I thought I was taking
Rae's mom to Motown Night

19:00.508 --> 19:03.348
and it turned out
to be Hoe-down Night.

19:04.247 --> 19:06.976
That was the worst
first date ever.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.249
And I loved
every minute of it.

19:11.226 --> 19:12.415
Really?

19:17.513 --> 19:18.839
Whee, doggy.

19:20.383 --> 19:21.514
Come on, partner.

19:21.515 --> 19:24.075
I'll go rustle up some
vittles in the saloon.

19:24.876 --> 19:26.441
You, too, Johnny Ray.

19:27.645 --> 19:29.176
It's Jimmy Ray.

19:29.177 --> 19:31.032
Don't you recognize me, Daddy?

19:32.473 --> 19:34.904
Well, I'm glad everything
worked out for you, Rae.

19:34.905 --> 19:36.714
Thanks.
Oh, and Eddie

19:36.715 --> 19:38.379
you know you couldn't
have done anything.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.644
About what, Rae?

19:39.645 --> 19:40.942
About your parents splitting up.

19:40.943 --> 19:42.235
I mean, didn't you hear
what they said?

19:42.236 --> 19:44.397
It's your mom and dad's problem,
not yours.

19:45.914 --> 19:47.249
I guess so.

19:47.585 --> 19:49.461
I just never really
thought of it that way.

19:50.643 --> 19:51.846
Thanks, Rae.

19:53.319 --> 19:54.344
Hey, guys.

19:54.345 --> 19:55.788
I'm going to wear my outfit
to school tomorrow

19:55.789 --> 19:58.360
because then if I forget
my homework I could just say

19:58.361 --> 19:59.819
"My wee doggy ate it."

20:00.310 --> 20:01.408
Get it?

20:01.952 --> 20:03.468
My wee doggy,
my doggy...

20:03.469 --> 20:04.804
Isn't that funny?

20:06.984 --> 20:08.285
No.

20:21.021 --> 20:22.646
Hey, look what I found.

20:24.276 --> 20:25.684
My ring.

20:25.685 --> 20:27.169
Where did you find it?

20:27.170 --> 20:28.915
I didn't. Lionel did.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.889
It was in his cage, sitting
in a big pile of rat poop.

20:38.245 --> 20:40.719
Honey, do you mind walking
Corey to school today?

20:40.720 --> 20:41.992
Yes, but I need the leash.

20:41.993 --> 20:43.399
And can you please
make him promise

20:43.400 --> 20:46.055
not to lift his leg up
every time he sees a bush?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.842
Hello. I'm the one
walking with a dog.

20:53.285 --> 20:56.476
You know, your dad and I thought
you might feel this way

20:56.477 --> 20:58.767
but we still think
that you should...

21:01.343 --> 21:03.613
# Walk together #
# Walk together #

21:03.614 --> 21:06.488
# You two were meant to be,
like brother and sister #

21:06.489 --> 21:07.791
# Brother and sister #

21:07.792 --> 21:09.745
# Why, you're a family #

21:10.845 --> 21:11.915
# Don't fight #

21:12.915 --> 21:14.215
# It ain't right #

21:15.088 --> 21:16.888
# You ought to be tight #

21:17.608 --> 21:18.888
# Walk together... #

21:18.889 --> 21:20.973
Okay! Okay! All right!

21:22.745 --> 21:24.037
Let's go. Hurry up.

21:24.038 --> 21:25.568
Don't let her
touch you. Come on.
