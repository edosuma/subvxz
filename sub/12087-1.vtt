00:51.176 --> 00:53.270
My name's Paul Raymond.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.814
Welcome to my world of erotica.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.844
-30?
-(Paul) Yes.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.464
(Fawn) 39?
(Paul) Yes.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.550
-50?
-(Paul) Yes.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.561
(Fawn) 55?
(Paul) Yes.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.389
Why do you buy
so many houses, Grandpa?

02:19.598 --> 02:24.069
(Paul) They're not houses, they're...
they're shops, restaurants, offices...

02:24.770 --> 02:26.522
cafes, clubs.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.569
But why so many?

02:29.900 --> 02:31.902
(Paul) I bought them for your mummy.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.706
For your mummy and...you
and your little sister.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.536
-(overlapping chatter)
-(car honks)

02:40.786 --> 02:43.505
-(cameras clicking)
-(reporters shouting)

02:43.914 --> 02:45.131
(Charles) Give him space.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.800
Please, move away.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.001
Can you give him some room, please?
Thank you.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.962
(reporter 1) Mr Raymond!
(reporter 2) Paul.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.505
(reporter 2) Paul!
(reporter 3) Mr Raymond.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.261
What can you tell us
about your daughter?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.183
(reporters clamouring)

02:56.218 --> 02:58.721
Debbie had all the money in the world.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.227
She had a beautiful house,

03:01.306 --> 03:02.558
beautiful children,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.438
beautiful cars.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.986
(cameras clicking)

03:07.688 --> 03:09.065
I don't understand it.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.487
(reporter 2) Okay, thank you.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.278
(reporters clamouring)

03:18.490 --> 03:19.582
(reporter 1) Thank you.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.633
(sighs)

03:46.852 --> 03:48.320
(clicking)

03:49.563 --> 03:50.815
I think we're both quite showy.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.113
<i>We're both quite extrovert
and sort of...</i>

03:54.776 --> 03:56.653
spark each other off in that way.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.123
<i>(Paul) I certainly, uh,
see</i> a <i>lot of myself in Debbie.</i>

04:00.323 --> 04:01.791
She's a maverick.

04:01.867 --> 04:06.122
Uh, [started out as a performer
and so did Debbie,

04:06.204 --> 04:08.832
and eventually I moved backstage

04:09.040 --> 04:11.668
and Debbie has followed a similar path.

04:13.378 --> 04:18.134
My name is Paul Raymond.
Please welcome La Cirque Nu de Paris.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.187
That's "nu", not "new".
It's French for "nude".

04:23.388 --> 04:25.436
'(band playing)
-(applause)

04:29.394 --> 04:32.068
(lion tamer) Come here.
Come here. Come here.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.278
Good boy. Out.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.447
Good boy, out. Out, steady now.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.663
Steady now.
Steady, Atlas, steady. Steady.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.283
- Come on. Come on. Out. Come on.
-(roaring)

04:42.783 --> 04:44.205
- Ahl

04:45.494 --> 04:46.962
- Paul, do the curtain.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.163
Get down. Get down.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.665
- We're not allowed.
-(lion tamer) You've got to.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.000
-(girl) We're not allowed to move.
- Don't be silly.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.675
Come on, you've got to. Get down, quick.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.468
-(audience cheering)
-(Paul) Listen to them.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.088
That's fantastic.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.099
(girl) Quick, hurry. Open the gate.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.644
- The curtain. Do the curtain.
-(Paul) Curtain!

05:04.888 --> 05:06.856
-It's all right.
- I was so scared.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.479
-(Jean) Florence, are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, great.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.935
A bloody lion tried to
eat me for dinner.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.146
- Calm down...
- I am not getting back in that cage.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.230
(Jean) Jim, how bad is it?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.156
Well, the audience liked it.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.660
(Paul)
You can't buy publicity like that.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.704
And they can't prosecute me
because the girls had to move.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.829
- You watch. Tonight we'll be sold out.
- Well, it's all right for you.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.626
I'm the one who's got
to go into the lion's den.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.123
Well, they're not gonna pay
to watch me in a cage.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.625
Oh, I would.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.166
(Paul) Back, by popular demand,

05:32.499 --> 05:37.096
Atlas the lion and
the amazing Cirque Nu de Paris.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.922
-(loud cheering)
-(fanfare playing)

05:39.756 --> 05:40.882
(roars)

05:46.596 --> 05:49.520
(Paul) Look at that. Fantastic.
We're in the nationals. Daily Sketch.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.896
It says I was nude.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.018
Does it matter?

05:52.227 --> 05:55.401
No, I wasn't nude.
I most certainly wasn't nude.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.617
I am a choreographer.
I'm Paul Raymond's wife. I'm not a nude.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.740
What would my mother say?

06:02.445 --> 06:03.571
- Well, they can't...
-it's half a page.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.998
They can't just make things up.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.371
Saying I was nude.
I wasn't bloody nude.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.378
I wasn't naked.
I was wearing a G-string.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.879
A G-skin?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.624
- A G-string.
-(laughter)

06:14.165 --> 06:15.838
It's a form of ladies underwear.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.887
You've been called the
"king of the keyhole shows".

06:19.170 --> 06:22.765
I like to think of myself as the, er...
"king of the glamour shows".

06:23.216 --> 06:26.641
Your shows are refined, respectable

06:26.720 --> 06:28.722
-and modest?
- Yes.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.433
Well, in that case,
surely it is a compliment for a woman

06:31.516 --> 06:33.610
to be classed as a "nude"?

06:34.269 --> 06:37.739
Paul, do you wish that your wife
hadn't tried to sue the Daily Sketch?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.988
I love my wife and I fully support her
in everything she does.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.740
Although she will
have to pay the legal costs.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.945
(laughter)

06:44.154 --> 06:47.658
Gentlemen, I'd love to stand around
and chat further

06:47.824 --> 06:51.078
but, er, my new members-only club
is opening in Soho,

06:51.161 --> 06:53.084
the heart of London's West End.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.756
Er, now being a private club,

06:54.831 --> 06:58.051
our nudes will move,
dance and express themselves.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.633
Gentlemen of the press are,
of course, welcome.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.682
Once you've paid the 10 shillings
and sixpence membership fee.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.429
-(laughter)
-if you come along this evening,

07:05.550 --> 07:09.271
you can enjoy a complimentary
glass of champagne. House champagne.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.768
Thank you.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.901
- I thought you handled that very well.
- Thank you.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.608
I hated that lawyer
making me look stupid.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.064
They didn't make you look stupid.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.658
They didn't "make you" look stupid.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.110
You.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.088
- I do hope this is a good idea.
-(Paul) It's gonna be a great night.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.712
We're a beacon of excellence
in a sea of mediocrity.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.797
Hello, Jean.
How'd it go in court, darling?

07:39.876 --> 07:42.345
- Dreadfully. We lost.
- Oh, yeah? How much you lose?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.548
Uh, it was all money well spent
as far as I'm concerned.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.632
Right.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.513
There's only one thing worse
than being talked about, Jimmy,

07:47.592 --> 07:48.809
and that is not being talked about.

07:48.885 --> 07:49.977
- Do you know who said that?
- No.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.101
Oscar Wilde.
Except he didn't say "Jimmy".

07:52.180 --> 07:54.899
-(Jimmy) Wasn't he a queer?
- Yes, he was one of the first.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.227
See you later.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.819
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- Hello, sir.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.362
- I'm all right, how are you?
- Little bit of striptease.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.609
Beautiful, beautiful girls.

08:00.981 --> 08:05.361
(Jean) One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. And one, two, three...

08:05.443 --> 08:07.241
(Paul) How's the prettiest girl
in the club?

08:07.362 --> 08:09.740
I don't mean you. I mean...
Hello, squeaky nose.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.621
Have you got a squeaky nose still?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.247
Ooh. (squeaks)

08:13.535 --> 08:15.958
Six seven, eight. Chins.
Two, three, four.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.416
-(Paul) How's she been?
- She's a beauty. Just like her father.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.378
Excellent.
Flattery very important for a hostess.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.132
And one, two, three, four...

08:24.254 --> 08:27.007
- So, are you gonna squeak my nose?
-(sighs)

08:27.298 --> 08:28.925
Well, there might be squeaking involved.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.011
- I can't promise it'll be your nose.
-(chuckles)

08:31.428 --> 08:35.058
Five six, seven, eight.
And one, two three, four, five, six...

08:35.265 --> 08:38.063
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.611
(Paul) Ah, there you are.
(Edwyn) Hello, Paul.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.032
Are we having a party?
Hello, sweetheart.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.984
We're just...
We're just chatting, really.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.320
How are you? You all right?
Tending to your flock, are you?

08:48.403 --> 08:52.158
Yes, everyone seems to be in, er...
you know, good spiritual health.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.993
- Oh!
- Out on the town, girls.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.954
Where is my costume?

08:57.078 --> 08:58.580
(dancer)
I'm gonna wear it for David, I think.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.381
I think there's something wrong
with my zip.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.759
I have a needle and cotton
if you need it.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.929
Girls, I want you all on stage
1O minutes before curtain. Okay?

09:06.004 --> 09:08.507
Oh, Betsy, you've decided
to join us, have you?

09:09.007 --> 09:11.385
I'm sorry, Mrs Raymond, I missed my bus.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.687
Well, next time you're out.
It's a professional theatre.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.435
- It's not a bloody fish and chip shop.
- Yes, Mrs Raymond.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.730
Uh, lipstick's bleeding.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.902
All right, lots of smiles.
Confident and enjoy.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.438
(dancers) Thank you.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.862
I ask the girls. I say, you know,
"Don't call me Reverend. Call me Edwyn.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.534
"Forget the dog collar.
Just see me as a friendly face.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.077
"And use that face as... as...
as you wish."

09:32.280 --> 09:33.497
(dancers giggling)

09:33.740 --> 09:35.993
You know, you shouldn't be in here
unless you're topless.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.582
Now, you save that cheek
for on stage, young lady.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.085
Adam and Eve were naked.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.333
Baby Jesus was naked for the first...

09:44.375 --> 09:45.843
part of his life.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.173
(people cheering)

09:52.133 --> 09:53.885
-(cabaret music playing)
-(applause)

09:58.473 --> 10:00.066
(Paul) A glass of champagne. Taittinger.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.227
(music continues)

10:20.829 --> 10:23.173
- To the future.
- To the future.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.757
(music continues)

10:35.510 --> 10:37.228
(interviewer) Paul Raymond's Revue Bar.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.726
To some, a Mecca.
To others, Sodom and Gomorrah.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.851
Ever since it opened in 1958,

10:42.934 --> 10:44.481
people have been flocking to the club

10:44.561 --> 10:47.940
that has become synonymous
with Soho, sex and sophistication.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.363
Mr Raymond has always been a pioneer.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.490
Pushing at the boundaries
of what is legal,

10:53.570 --> 10:55.413
occasionally crossing the line.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.957
This has brought him rich rewards.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.036
His club turns over more than
a quarter of a million pounds a year.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.542
(applause)

11:03.830 --> 11:04.831
Bravo.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.632
(interviewer)
Even as the '60s started to swing,

11:06.708 --> 11:08.802
it seemed people were willing
to pay good money

11:08.877 --> 11:11.050
to see a girl take her clothes off.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.515
Now,
with the Lord Chamberlain abolished,

11:14.591 --> 11:18.141
Paul Raymond faces a new challenge
and a new opportunity.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.439
Legitimate West End theatres
can put on shows with naked girls,

11:22.015 --> 11:25.986
so Mr Raymond has plans to transform
himself into a theatre impresario.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.692
But, for today, he has his hands full,

11:28.771 --> 11:31.240
rehearsing a new dance show
for his Revue Bar.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.368
Okay. Hold it, hold it, hold it.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.993
We're now getting near
to the end of the act.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.667
What I want you to do is,
now, readjust the ending,

11:41.743 --> 11:43.461
so that, by the end,
you're completely nude.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.791
That's great. Undulate.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.254
Remember more... more...
more snake-like movements.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.422
The fact that Midas
has turned you to gold...

11:54.505 --> 11:55.722
Don't worry about the logic of that.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.597
You're not gold ingots,
you're beautiful women

11:58.676 --> 12:00.428
and the gold
doesn't impede your movements.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.979
Very fluid.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.811
Excellent. Great.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.898
Mr Raymond, what makes
a good striptease artist'?

12:07.977 --> 12:10.025
(Paul) Well, the girls are...

12:10.188 --> 12:11.405
in a sense, actors

12:11.481 --> 12:14.610
and they must persuade the men
that they're enjoying the experience.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.070
Uh, so it's a performance
and they must be convincing.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.867
And how did your career begin?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.162
Well, I'm an entertainer,
first and foremost.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.539
I started out with a mind-reading act.

12:23.618 --> 12:28.249
Erm, and I soon realised that people
like to look at attractive girls.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.426
And they liked it even more
if the girls had no clothes on.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.132
Er, so in that sense,
in that sense alone,

12:34.212 --> 12:35.930
I could read people's minds.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.433
(interviewer) In leafy SW19,

12:39.550 --> 12:43.100
not far from the world-famous
grass courts of Wimbledon Tennis Club,

12:43.179 --> 12:45.807
he and his young family
live among the company directors,

12:45.974 --> 12:47.897
city bankers and lawyers.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.195
His son and daughter
go to public schools

12:50.270 --> 12:51.772
and enjoy the right sports.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.530
Not bad for a boy from Liverpool
who arrived with five bob in his pocket.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.830
(Jean) Good try, darling.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.909
Yes, try and hit it, though, Howard.
Try and hit it with the bat.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.921
Okay, again, one more time. Thanks.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.294
Again.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.377
(Jean) Come on, Howard.
Keep your eye on the ball.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.005
Yes! Out! Out!

13:17.088 --> 13:19.432
(interviewer) All this is the measure
of Raymond's success,

13:19.507 --> 13:21.225
far from the grey class certainties

13:21.301 --> 13:23.429
of Moseley Hill, Liverpool,
where he was born.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.189
(Paul) My father left home
when I was just a baby.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.943
Uh, so I was brought up
in a house full of women.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.895
So I'm very comfortable around them.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.814
Um, we moved to Glossop
when I was a child,

13:34.897 --> 13:37.275
where I was educated
by the Sisters of Notre Dame.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.744
What would the nuns think
of what you do now?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.742
I think that they would be forgiving.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.869
I think, you know,
I mean, I'm very strict.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.201
I would never allow anything blasphemous
in any of my shows.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.412
No, never.
I wouldn't have some...

13:48.494 --> 13:51.668
one of the dancers, you know,
dressed as a nun, you know, with...

13:51.748 --> 13:54.718
suspenders under her habit,
you know.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.135
You know, pulling the rope off
a Franciscan monk and, you know,

13:59.213 --> 14:01.932
having him ravage her or something,
you know, in a confessional box.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.477
I would never do anything like that
because I would find that offensive.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.270
Do you keep in touch with your father?

14:06.888 --> 14:08.640
Uh, no, he disappeared completely.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.813
(eastern music playing)

14:14.520 --> 14:16.818
Would you say everything you touch
turns to gold'?

14:17.148 --> 14:20.402
Not... not everything, er...
but enough.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.994
Mr Raymond, thank you very much.
Cheers.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.450
You're more than welcome.
Thank you.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.459
What time do you finish tonight?

14:28.576 --> 14:29.873
I think about 5:00.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.004
(Paul) You're a sweetheart.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.624
(Kim) I think an hour with me
will sort you right out.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.833
(girls giggle)

14:35.917 --> 14:38.966
- Well, I may well take you up on that.
-(girls laugh)

15:10.118 --> 15:11.119
Hello.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.838
I was trying not to wake you.

15:13.996 --> 15:14.997
What time is it?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.675
(sighs) Uh, late. Well, early.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.429
- Was she nice?
- Uh, a girl. Just a girl.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.756
Mmm?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.009
- What's that?
- Hmm?

15:26.467 --> 15:28.720
Oh, shit. (stutters) It's gold paint.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.565
One of the girls in the Midas thing,
you know.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.273
(sighs) Makes a change from lipstick.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.693
You wouldn't want a husband
who was surrounded by all these...

15:39.772 --> 15:42.901
beautiful, naked girls
and have no libido.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.952
- Would you?
- Oh, I don't know.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.831
You could have a boy if you want.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.499
_ "Mmm?

15:51.576 --> 15:52.998
Would you be there?

15:53.202 --> 15:54.875
Yes. Of course.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.503
And would you make love to him, too?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.842
- No, of course not.
-(both chuckle)

16:00.877 --> 16:02.379
And where would this be happening?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.464
Right here. In our bedroom.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.220
And what would you be doing?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.719
I'd be over there in the chair. Tied up.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.305
How would it all get started?

16:12.388 --> 16:15.107
- Well, the doorbell would ring.
- Would you answer it?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.106
Well, of course I can't.
I'm fucking tied up, aren't I?

16:17.185 --> 16:19.529
- I'm not Houdini.
-(laughing)

16:21.355 --> 16:23.574
(auctioneer) Twenty-five with you, sir.
Thirty with you, sir.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.117
Forty.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.200
Forty-five, sir. With you at 45.

16:28.279 --> 16:32.079
I am looking for £50,000.
Fifty at the back.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.410
(Paul) Debbie, this is Carl. My lawyer.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.541
- Hello, Debbie.
-(Debbie) Morning.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.622
£60,000.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.378
I have 60. I'm looking for 65.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.760
Do I see... Thank you, 65.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.303
Seventy with you, sir. Seventy-five.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.847
Hundred and fifty.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.674
(auctioneer) No further bidding.

16:48.299 --> 16:51.223
Sold to you, sir, for £150,000.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.813
- Do you own that one?
- No.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.891
-15?
- No.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.355
-(Debbie) What about 78?
- Not 78.

16:58.643 --> 17:02.238
-76?
-76 is mine. I own 34.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.073
- What about the next one?
- No.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.484
-(Debbie) Is this yours?
- That's mine, yes.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.529
- Say "mine". I mean "ours", of course.
- Of course.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.329
I own this one here.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.407
(Debbie) Why? It's horrible.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.169
Some of the streets...
some of them are a little bit scruffy.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.088
So why do you buy so many buildings?

17:19.247 --> 17:22.968
Because, uh, one day
you will own the company

17:23.084 --> 17:26.179
and nothing confers more respectability
on someone than property.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.632
Do you want a piece of cake
from that shop there?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.351
(Debbie) Yes. Obviously.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.559
I told you I could
read people's minds, didn't I, eh?

17:35.846 --> 17:37.974
Can I have the berry cheesecake,

17:38.099 --> 17:39.942
the strawberry mountain,

17:40.017 --> 17:42.145
the cake with the almonds on the side

17:43.229 --> 17:44.856
and the marzipan figs?

17:48.442 --> 17:49.864
-(Paul sighs) Debbie!
- Mmm!

17:50.027 --> 17:51.700
You're not supposed to eat them all.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.498
They're to share with the other girls,
to help you make friends.

17:54.949 --> 17:58.829
Now, we must insist that you
don't come inside to the dormitory.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.788
It's a rule that we have here.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.839
It can be very upsetting
for the children.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.916
Right.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.128
But they do get over it
after a week or so.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.587
Right.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.519
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.775
Hello, I'm here for the audition.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.321
Too late, I'm afraid.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.825
Are you sure you can't just
squeeze one more in'?

18:28.899 --> 18:30.071
Hold on one moment.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.244
- Mr Raymond?
- Mmm?

18:35.573 --> 18:37.075
I'm here for the auditions.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.367
You're late.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.086
Yes. No. Yes, lam late.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.005
But I told myself
that I wasn't going to come in

18:43.080 --> 18:46.755
unless there was a free parking meter,
which usually there never is.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.259
But, at the last second,
a red Cortina pulled out.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.806
So...here I am.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.347
Luck, hopefully, or destiny?

18:56.719 --> 18:58.721
- Uh, what's your name?
- Um, Amber.

18:58.804 --> 19:02.354
Well, my real name is Julia
but I call myself Amber.

19:02.433 --> 19:05.607
I see. Yes, well,
my name's not really Paul Raymond.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.443
It's, uh...
My real name's actually Geoffrey Quinn.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.523
Oh.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.324
Gosh. (chuckles)

19:14.445 --> 19:17.665
It's really...
It's quite grand, isn't it?

19:18.949 --> 19:21.793
Well, in your own time,
if you'd like to take off your robe.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.916
Of course.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.259
Excellent. Um, turn round, please.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.929
- Exquisite.
-(9i99le$)

19:36.384 --> 19:38.227
if you want to hop into the pool.

19:38.928 --> 19:39.929
Yes.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.722
If you'll fit.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.059
Think you're almost as tall
as the pool is long.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.397
(Amber chuckles) Yes.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.019
Breast stroke?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.483
- Of course.
-(Am ber chuckles)

19:48.938 --> 19:50.406
(water splashes)

19:54.694 --> 19:56.947
(Yvonne) How could any man
be such a cad'?

19:57.071 --> 19:58.573
Such a hypocrite

19:58.698 --> 20:01.622
as to make love to me
whilst he had a wife?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.790
(Leonard) Oh, any man
who would do that...

20:03.869 --> 20:04.916
(audience laughs)

20:04.995 --> 20:06.292
(Yvonne) I thought
you were like other men,

20:06.372 --> 20:07.919
-eager to start an affair...
-(whispers) Quickly.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.796
(Yvonne) ...as long as there were
no strings attached.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.794
-(audience cheering)
-(wolf whistle)

20:16.549 --> 20:19.223
Leonard, Leonard!
Who are those women?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.141
Oh, they're our neighbours.
We let them use the swimming pool.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.645
- They're very liberated.
- Mmm! Liberated from their clothes.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.397
Leonard, I need a huge favour.

20:26.517 --> 20:29.236
You need a place to hide
from this nasty story

20:29.311 --> 20:30.608
-that's going around about you.
-(Leonard) Yes.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.441
(actress 1) Well, it's clear to me,
George, you've made a fool out of me

20:33.524 --> 20:35.151
and I'm leaving you.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.785
(actress 2) And I'm leaving you.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.371
(George) Oh, no, you're not.
I'm leaving you.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.074
(Leonard)
And I'm leaving you, Yvonne, after all.

20:41.157 --> 20:45.412
- In my house with my best friend.
-(Yvonne) Absolute nonsense!

20:45.494 --> 20:48.714
It was I, yes, I
who spent the night with him...

20:48.789 --> 20:50.462
(dialogue fades)

20:51.625 --> 20:53.878
(George speaks gibberish)

20:56.172 --> 20:58.095
(audience cheering)

21:12.104 --> 21:13.276
(upbeat music playing)

21:16.108 --> 21:19.237
-(man) ...lovely boy.
- Rusty! You fancy a drink?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.994
- Er... Oh! How are you?
- I'm celebrating.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.449
- Yeah. You want to join us for a drink?
- Oh, yeah, come on.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.910
Dave can look after here.
It's dead tonight anyway.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.212
(J1 Born Under a Bad Sign
by Booker T & the MGs)

21:29.371 --> 21:30.918
(Paul) Ladies.
(Jimmy) Yeah, thanks, darling.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.584
(Jimmy) on, look at this.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.340
(Jean) Thank you.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.008
Where did you find this lot?

21:37.338 --> 21:38.635
Vienna. Vienna, yes.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.887
(Jimmy) Must have cost you a few bob.
(Paul) No, no.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.677
Just shipping and packing.
And that's just the women.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.146
(Rusty) Oh, I'd like a big snake
like that. Wouldn't you, Jean?

21:45.221 --> 21:46.347
Yeah, I bet you do. (chuckling)

21:47.223 --> 21:48.270
(man) Here's the papers, Mr Raymond.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.813
Right, here we go.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.192
"Hoot or miss?

21:55.022 --> 21:58.652
"Pyjama Tops is the worst acted farce
I have ever seen on any stage

21:58.734 --> 22:00.156
"in the last 25 years."

22:00.277 --> 22:01.278
- Ooh!
-(Jean) That's rubbish.

22:01.362 --> 22:04.832
"It is littered with
arbitrary displays of naked flesh."

22:04.907 --> 22:06.625
Well, he's not wrong there.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.871
To be described as
the worst play in the last 25 years

22:09.954 --> 22:13.675
is almost as good as being described
as the best play in the last 25 years.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.214
Because people
are going to talk about it,

22:16.293 --> 22:17.761
and that's all that matters.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.385
Here's to the worst play
in the last 25 years.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.848
(all) To the worst play.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.350
Bottoms up. Literally.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.469
(applause, cheering)

22:33.185 --> 22:34.903
(girls) Bye.
(Amber) Have a good weekend.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.280
- Bye, Annabell.
- Bye, love.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.033
- Hello, Amber.
- Hello.

22:40.276 --> 22:43.576
Congratulations on
a very successful first week.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.243
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.159
Anyway I got this bottle of
chilled vintage champagne

22:48.325 --> 22:52.455
and the Rolls is outside and I thought
perhaps, you know, we could...

22:52.830 --> 22:53.831
celebrate.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.043
The audience really lapped it up,
didn't they?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.003
You soaked the first three rows.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.890
- You know, I actually own the theatre.
- Oh, really'?

23:02.965 --> 23:04.217
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Wow.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.394
- The Windmill Theatre, you know that?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.685
Yeah, that's...
that's one of mine.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.680
- The Revue Bar, of course.
- Yes.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.436
- Yes.
- Raymond's Revue Bar.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.777
I am probably one of the biggest
show producers in the UK.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.939
Wow.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.574
So tell me all about yourself,
warts and all.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.200
- Gosh. Um...
- Actually, skip the warts.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.075
(Amber) Well, once I was a nanny
for a woman

23:29.158 --> 23:31.286
whose boyfriend
happened to be Sean Connery.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.294
- Really? Yes.
- Mmm.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.248
And, uh, did he try to kiss you?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.425
(laughs) I was... I was 17.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.002
Mmm, and he was James Bond. So...

23:40.753 --> 23:43.176
Actually, he was, um...
he was really nice.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.680
He, er, gave me two tickets
to the Dr No premiere.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.016
- Did he now?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.390
And, uh, he kissed me aftewvards.

23:53.724 --> 23:57.524
- Did he? On the lips?
- Yes.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.278
And, um, was it like this?

24:06.236 --> 24:08.955
Mmm. No, it was
a little bit more like, um...

24:19.249 --> 24:20.671
Like that.

24:22.670 --> 24:23.671
Well, um...

24:24.713 --> 24:26.636
(mimics Sean Connery)
I'm shaken but not stirred.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.762
(laughing)

24:28.634 --> 24:31.478
Very good.
You sound very like him.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.143
I've even got the eyebrows.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.439
- Did you notice?
- Yes, you do.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.107
Yes, you'd make a very good,
uh, Honey Ryder.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.445
'Cause I could just imagine you
like Ursula Andress,

24:40.521 --> 24:43.866
you know, emerging from the, uh...
from the waves.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.909
With a dagger strapped to my thigh.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.489
Yes, perhaps you could be, er...
my Honey Ryder in the, er...

24:50.030 --> 24:51.156
in the Caribbean.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.534
I'd love to be. Hmm.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.719
(Paul) Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

25:08.674 --> 25:09.675
What time is it?

25:10.384 --> 25:11.476
(sighs)

25:11.552 --> 25:12.769
Just after 2:00.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.685
That's early.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.697
- What was she like?
- Nice.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.702
Good in bed?

25:30.112 --> 25:31.614
I don't know.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.326
- Night, girls.
- See you later, Jack.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.707
- Have you kept the school uniform?
-(girl) Oh, of course I still have it.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.834
-(laughter)
-(knock on door)

25:41.206 --> 25:43.004
Mr Raymond's waiting
at the stage door, Amber.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.468
Oh, thank you.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.088
-(girls) Ooh!
- Mr Raymond!

25:47.296 --> 25:48.843
Yes, Mr Raymond.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.091
Going home with the boss-man.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.851
- Maybe.
-(girl) You want to be careful.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.596
- Night, Jack.
- Night.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.111
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

26:10.736 --> 26:14.240
J1 I'm just mad about Saffron

26:15.324 --> 26:18.794
J1 Saffron's mad about me

26:20.454 --> 26:23.298
J1 I'm just mad about Saffron

26:24.333 --> 26:25.926
J1 She's just mad about me

26:26.293 --> 26:27.590
(tyres screeching)

26:28.003 --> 26:29.676
J1 They call me mellow yellow

26:29.880 --> 26:31.598
J1 Quite rightly

26:32.216 --> 26:33.889
I hope it's big enough for you.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.389
(chuckles) I think it is.

26:35.469 --> 26:36.971
Talking about the room.

26:37.471 --> 26:38.518
Nice jugs-.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.598
(Amber chuckles)

26:40.974 --> 26:41.975
(grunts)

26:42.976 --> 26:44.023
Yes, I fit.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.063
Yay! (laughs)

26:46.855 --> 26:50.485
I had a mind-reading act
called Mr and Miss-tree.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.076
Mr and Miss-tree!

26:52.152 --> 26:55.031
- Yes. It's very clever word play...
-it's very clever.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.410
Ah, I love it
when you do all the work.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.749
It's so nice when you're on top.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.415
Especially 'cause of my bad back.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.718
There would be a code system,
uh, for the alphabet.

27:10.587 --> 27:14.308
And the word for "P" was "come",
and the word for "N" was "here".

27:14.466 --> 27:17.219
So if she said, "Come, Mr Raymond,
what do we have here?"

27:17.302 --> 27:19.100
I would say,
"Come-here, P-N. Pen."

27:19.388 --> 27:23.313
Oysters start off as male
and become female.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.648
I did not know that.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.276
- Well, there you go. It's, uh...
- Thank you for that fascinating fact.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.323
I'll give you a fascinating fact
every day.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.992
- Mmm!
- After we've made love.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.819
- Okay.
- A sort of motivation for you.

27:33.902 --> 27:34.949
Oh, great.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.527
I'll be staying at the Mayfair Hotel.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.813
You're a coward. Do you know that?

28:09.897 --> 28:12.901
You're just like your father.
Walking out on your children, on your...

28:13.066 --> 28:14.568
on your family.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.325
Oh, Howard. Howard's here.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.657
You're just in time
to see Daddy leaving.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.040
Look after your mum.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.208
Do you want to tell him
where you're going?

28:22.284 --> 28:24.412
Go on.
Tell your son where you're going!

28:24.912 --> 28:27.916
You're a lying, cheating bastard
and I hate you!

28:29.917 --> 28:31.339
You just wait.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.092
Wait until I tell Debbie
what her dad's really like.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.050
That some stuck-up
fucking little vicar's daughter's

28:37.132 --> 28:38.850
more important than she is.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.520
Don't you dare turn Debbie against me.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.097
Don't you threaten me.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.016
(Paul sighs)

28:46.975 --> 28:48.522
(Jean sobbing)

28:53.398 --> 28:56.242
If only I could trust you.
Start a new life with you.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.116
Tonight our happiness begins.

28:58.612 --> 28:59.738
(Amber) Will you give me your word

28:59.821 --> 29:02.449
-your wife means nothing to you?
- Nothing.

29:02.908 --> 29:07.584
Evening, Jeff. Um, what dressing room
is Amber St George in?

29:07.663 --> 29:09.040
Dressing room four, Mrs Raymond.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.749
Dressing room four, thank you.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.214
(man) Well, I'm not gonna wear this.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.045
I mean, it just feels like
somebody else's suit

29:15.128 --> 29:17.176
and I can't wear it.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.799
(girls chatting, laughing)

29:22.970 --> 29:26.816
(Jean) You keep your hands
off my husband.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.608
He's got two children!

29:28.684 --> 29:31.028
And they need a father,
even one like him.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.317
He probably tells you you're special,
doesn't he'? Oh, he tells everyone that.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.324
Do you know he's had half the girls
in every bloody show we've done?

29:39.403 --> 29:42.156
- Has he had you, love, has he?
- No... (clears throat) ...Jean.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.746
(Jean) Oh, you're nothing special.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.794
In fact, I don't even know
what he sees in you.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.122
You're just a jumped-up
posh little tart.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.883
Well, have you got anything to say?
Can you speak?

29:52.958 --> 29:53.959
(Amber) Yes, I can speak.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.670
(mimics) "Yes, I can speak.
Yes, I can speak."

29:57.004 --> 29:59.473
Don't you look your
snotty little nose up at me.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.343
- Yes, can I help you?
-(giggling)

30:03.593 --> 30:05.186
What are you looking at?

30:07.973 --> 30:10.021
Oh, and you were rubbish
in the play tonight.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.317
(actor) Thank you.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.651
- Night-night, Jeff.
-(Jeff) Goodnight, Mrs Raymond.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.241
(Amber) Is that Jean?

30:22.738 --> 30:24.160
Is she following us?

30:24.656 --> 30:26.078
You're being paranoid.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.796
(Amber) I told you she was following us.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.211
I'll go and talk to her.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.593
(engine revving)

30:48.305 --> 30:49.477
This is silly.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.312
You're the one being silly.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.019
It won't last.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.063
- What won't?
- She won't!

30:56.605 --> 30:58.653
Perhaps, but this is ridiculous.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.076
It's not the 19th century.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.904
Yeah, I don't care what
bloody century we're in!

31:03.987 --> 31:05.113
I'm your wife!

31:06.073 --> 31:08.075
She's making a fool out of me.
It's humiliating.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.081
(Paul) Well, what are you doing here?
Go home.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.289
- Get some sleep.
- Well, come with me.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.675
Paul, come with me.
Get in the car now.

31:19.628 --> 31:20.675
No.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.469
If you don't leave her now
that is it, it's over.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.178
That is absolutely it.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.855
Don't you come running back begging.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.611
Jean, I've never begged
for anything in my life.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.864
Goodbye, then.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.797
(tyres screeching)

31:56.706 --> 31:58.925
Mrs Raymond, you're smiling.
How much did you get?

31:59.376 --> 32:01.470
Well, I'm very, very happy
with the settlement.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.719
It entitles me to 250,000.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.717
Well, this is a great day.
It's like throwing away your crutches.

32:07.801 --> 32:08.802
(laughing)

32:08.885 --> 32:10.603
I deserve every penny.
I've worked damn hard.

32:10.679 --> 32:11.680
(male reporter) There he is.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.315
(all) Mr Raymond!

32:18.603 --> 32:21.231
(female reporter) Mr Raymond, this is
one of the largest divorce settlements

32:21.314 --> 32:22.657
this country's ever seen.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.734
Ah, well, it's... I think you'll find

32:24.818 --> 32:26.820
it's the largest divorce settlement
this country's ever seen.

32:27.154 --> 32:30.033
Not bad for a boy who arrived from
Liverpool with five bob in his pocket.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.283
(laughing)

32:33.410 --> 32:35.833
Just gonna warn you,
I don't own the whole building.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.004
Just the, uh, top floor.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.709
(gasping)

32:41.168 --> 32:42.715
Oh, I love it.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.639
These are the two ladies with big balls.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.931
(Amber) Ladies with balls.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.759
Spirit of Ecstasy.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.685
- You'll be seeing a bit more of him.
- Yes, you love that.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.934
And this is, uh,
this is all designed by Ringo Starr.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.895
- Oh, really?
- Yes. That lamp's a bit low.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.976
Uh, yes. It's nice, isn't it?

32:58.059 --> 32:59.106
(Amber) Ooh, I love it.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.321
- Follow me, come on.
- Come on, I'm going to shoo you in.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.522
- I'm the Pied Piper.
-(Amber laughs)

33:02.689 --> 33:05.192
Follow me into the, er...
Well, not the sewer.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.778
That wouldn't be appropriate
but, uh, the bedroom.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.863
- Fairy-tale bed.
- Yes, it is.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.537
You could get Snow White
and the Seven Dwarves on here.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.334
Starting with, um, Dopey,

33:14.493 --> 33:15.870
and, uh, Happy.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.458
No dwarves.

33:17.829 --> 33:18.876
- Really?
- Mmm.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.590
Press this button.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.794
(Amber) Ooh.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.680
- Better close your eyes.
-(Amber gasps)

33:26.755 --> 33:27.756
(Amber giggling)

33:33.553 --> 33:35.476
(Amber) That is amazing.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.017
(Paul) It's almost like living
inside a giant missile silo.

33:38.308 --> 33:40.481
What, for your, uh, big rocket?

33:41.019 --> 33:43.021
- Mmm. Yes.
- Mmm.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.425
Your guest is seated at your table, sir.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.929
Excellent.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.806
(Tony) £12,000 to you.

34:15.136 --> 34:18.264
I tried doing a magazine in the '60s.
Uh, King. It didn't work.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.942
That's because you didn't know
what you were doing.

34:21.268 --> 34:25.614
We will persuade readers that,
by buying Men Only,

34:25.688 --> 34:27.942
they are buying into the world
of Paul Raymond. Right?

34:28.024 --> 34:29.867
The world of cigars

34:29.943 --> 34:33.822
and exotic holidays and luxury cars.

34:33.989 --> 34:37.835
This will take the world of Paul Raymond
out to the nation.

34:37.951 --> 34:38.998
There will be lots of girls.

34:39.119 --> 34:40.962
Beautiful girls,
beautifully photographed.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.293
We copy the car magazines, right?

34:42.621 --> 34:45.091
We have,
as the face of our magazine,

34:45.166 --> 34:48.670
we have a hot female columnist,
right,

34:48.753 --> 34:51.347
and she road-tests the men of Europe.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.013
I have a contact at John Menzies.

34:54.217 --> 34:58.563
Menzies have 5,000 newsagents.
That's their own newsagents.

34:59.306 --> 35:03.652
Their distribution arm
covers another 20,000.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.528
It's a perfect,

35:05.687 --> 35:07.610
perfect market for advertisers.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.865
Well, if you can, er, edit
as well as you talk,

35:12.861 --> 35:15.080
then, er...I'm very interested.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.378
We're looking for someone who would,
erm, road-test the men of Europe.

35:29.836 --> 35:30.837
Me.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.339
- Could be.
- I'd like that job.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.011
And I'm a very good driver.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.720
It wouldn't be cars
that you'd be driving.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.895
The columns will have to sound sexy.

35:39.971 --> 35:40.972
- Yeah.
-(Amber clears throat)

35:41.056 --> 35:43.354
"Her lips parted.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.528
"His hot, hard member thrust into her."

35:46.936 --> 35:47.983
-it's a good start.
- That's good, that's good.

35:48.021 --> 35:53.073
"He pushed his tongue deep into
her hot, wet, velvet pussy."

35:53.485 --> 35:54.486
Also good.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.368
"He bit my lips hard

35:57.447 --> 36:01.168
"and my whole body shuddered

36:01.242 --> 36:04.121
"as his swelling member
forced its way inside me."

36:04.829 --> 36:06.331
Can I see you with your clothes off?

36:06.581 --> 36:08.629
- If you give me the job.
-(Tony chuckles)

36:09.834 --> 36:11.086
(Tony) We have to think
what we're gonna call you.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.671
Emily Spankhurst?

36:12.754 --> 36:14.301
- That sounds like a porn name.
- Come on, be serious.

36:14.381 --> 36:15.803
Georgina Allcock.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.600
Oh! Iona Jaguar.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.179
I own a Jaguar.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.262
Yeah, we got...

36:21.388 --> 36:23.231
- I don't like Iona. I don't like Iona.
- Oh. Um...

36:23.306 --> 36:25.775
Fi-ona. Fiona Jaguar.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.102
(Paul) It's too... It's too exotic.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.479
- Fiona's good.
- Fiona Kent.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.778
- Yeah.
- Fiona Kew.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.902
- Fiona Richmond.
- Yeah, no, Fiona Richmond.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.992
It's too like "Raymond".
It's too like you.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.535
- Perfect.
-(Tony laughs)

36:35.610 --> 36:36.611
Perfect.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.198
- Oh, that's so romantic and sweet.
- Fiona Richmond.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.492
My name is Fiona Richmond.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.576
(camera clicking)

36:43.952 --> 36:44.999
I'm a professional journalist,

36:45.078 --> 36:49.549
hired by Britain's new and most
sophisticated men's magazine

36:49.624 --> 36:53.720
to travel my way around Europe
and ask penetrating questions.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.348
Need something to make it
a bit less picnic,

36:57.424 --> 36:58.550
a bit more cornucopia.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.310
Here you go. This is luxury.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.053
It is dead.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.639
- Should have had a crab.
-(laughing)

37:04.639 --> 37:07.813
Around the World in Eighty Lays
by Fiona Richmond.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.519
(assistant) More fan mail.
(Tony) More?

37:10.186 --> 37:11.688
Bloody hell, we've created a monster.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.156
And it's me!

37:13.648 --> 37:16.572
(Fiona) Vladimir's strong hands
held me aloft

37:16.651 --> 37:19.530
before dropping me down
on to his upright stalk.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.080
"I wish that you would spank
my naughty bottom like mummy did."

37:29.164 --> 37:31.132
- That might be for me.
-(laughter)

37:39.174 --> 37:41.848
- Think of me.
- Or, if it helps, think of me.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.183
Look at Paul but think of me.

37:44.888 --> 37:45.935
A bit more tit.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.986
The butcher's counter at Harrods,
is at Harrods,

37:59.068 --> 38:00.866
but it's still selling meat, isn't it?
Right, so...

38:00.945 --> 38:02.697
I'm not sure I like Fiona
being compared to a piece of meat.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.785
(clears throat) She's tasty,
you want to eat her. She's rare.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.180
-(footsteps)
-(bell tolling)

38:43.655 --> 38:45.282
Pa, I was only smoking.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.200
(Paul sighs)

38:47.367 --> 38:49.290
That's not really a crime, is it?

38:49.911 --> 38:54.712
Well, you were smoking a marijuana joint
which is illegal, yes.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.844
I can't believe...

38:57.919 --> 39:02.049
that that fat cow expelled me.

39:04.551 --> 39:07.179
You're the one that wanted to
go to that school. You insisted.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.764
Well, I want to go to drama school.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.273
I want to follow in your footsteps
and go out into the world

39:15.395 --> 39:16.897
and do all of those things.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.281
(saxophone playing)

39:23.486 --> 39:26.239
J1 I can hardly wait to hold you

39:26.322 --> 39:28.450
J1 Feel my arms around you

39:29.409 --> 39:32.037
J1 How long I have waited

39:32.245 --> 39:34.293
J1 Waited just to love you

39:34.372 --> 39:37.376
J1 Now that I have found you

39:38.084 --> 39:40.928
J1 Don't ever go

39:44.465 --> 39:46.559
(Paul) Here's to a star of tomorrow.
(Amber) Yes, absolutely.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.760
Pa, thank you. Thank you.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.224
- To Debbie Raymond.
-(Debbie) Cheers.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.560
Cheers.

39:52.682 --> 39:55.231
(Debbie) One thing,
if it's going to be an erotic show,

39:55.476 --> 39:58.320
does that mean, um...
Would I be scantily clad?

39:58.521 --> 40:00.740
No, you will not have to
take your clothes off, of course.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.692
I would never ask my daughter
to do that.

40:02.775 --> 40:03.992
(Debbie) 'Cause the other people
on stage... Thank you.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.866
-...probably would...
- Yes, of course there'll be nudity.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.448
- But you won't. No, no.
- I just wanted to make sure,

40:08.531 --> 40:12.536
because I don't have the equipment
to, sort of, deliver the goods.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.917
(cabaret music playing)

40:17.373 --> 40:20.297
Remember to look up, look up.
Okay, now stay here.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.088
(ma/e choreographer) One, two.
Really swivel those hips.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.173
And two.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.139
And look, and look and dance break.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.393
At the sides.

40:34.057 --> 40:37.561
(director) Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.149
- Cut, cut!
-(mouthing)

40:39.479 --> 40:40.856
Cut.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.158
Ok, let's get the girls in the hoops.

40:44.651 --> 40:47.154
(both vocalising)

40:51.157 --> 40:53.285
(director)
We've got Miss Nude International

40:53.368 --> 40:56.793
followed by Genghis Khan
and Attila the Hun.

40:56.913 --> 41:00.213
(Paul) I think Genghis Khan and
Attila the Hun together is too much,

41:00.291 --> 41:02.714
because it's basically
rape and pillage twice.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.552
Ladies.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.476
- Hello.
- Hi.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.144
My soubrette.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.642
My ingénue.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.769
(kissing)

41:15.848 --> 41:17.316
Do you think I look stupid?

41:18.267 --> 41:19.689
You look beautiful.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.813
Like a peacock.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.445
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Thank you all for waiting.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.785
I hope I haven't kept you too long.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.612
Uh, right.
Well, I'll set straight to it.

41:29.779 --> 41:32.703
I'm here to announce
my latest production,

41:32.782 --> 41:34.625
which is entitled Royalty Follies.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.376
This will be the most expensive
production ever mounted

41:38.454 --> 41:39.751
in the UK.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.175
Uh, we understand that
your daughter is to be in the show.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.672
Will she be topless?

41:43.751 --> 41:45.048
No, she will not.

41:45.378 --> 41:47.096
Isn't that a double standard?

41:47.422 --> 41:51.268
Someone had to keep their clothes on
and Debbie bravely volunteered.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.886
(laughing)

41:53.094 --> 41:55.188
-(vocalising)
- Good.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.644
(vocalising)

41:57.932 --> 42:00.401
-(vocalising)
- Okay.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.570
(cabaret music playing)

42:07.525 --> 42:10.699
J1 My baby does it good

42:11.487 --> 42:13.990
J1 He treats it like he should

42:15.950 --> 42:18.294
J1 When I'm feeling down

42:18.369 --> 42:20.167
J1 When I'm feeling gloomy

42:20.872 --> 42:23.921
J1 I tell you now
he really socks it to me

42:25.334 --> 42:27.553
J1 Shooby-do and sure enough

42:29.338 --> 42:31.932
J1 My baby really knows his stuff

42:32.175 --> 42:34.974
J1 Yeah, my baby does it good

42:36.095 --> 42:39.770
J1 My baby does it good

42:40.058 --> 42:41.901
(J1 Wig Wam Bam by Sweet)

42:47.315 --> 42:49.693
(Russian music playing)

42:57.784 --> 42:58.785
(woman coughing)

42:59.285 --> 43:00.286
(snoring)

43:02.872 --> 43:05.921
J1 Thank you for coming to Follies

43:07.585 --> 43:11.681
J1 We hope that we'll see you soon

43:11.756 --> 43:16.683
J1 We'd like you to know
just before you go

43:17.386 --> 43:21.687
J1 Thank you for seeing our show

43:21.766 --> 43:23.268
(music ends)

43:23.935 --> 43:25.357
(scattered applause)

43:33.694 --> 43:35.367
- Good morning, Dennis.
- Morning, sir.

43:35.488 --> 43:36.580
- How are you'?
- Very well, thank you.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.124
Good, good.

43:40.326 --> 43:41.327
How bad is it?

43:41.869 --> 43:43.371
Bookings just aren't coming in.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.832
If it carries on like this
we're gonna take a real beating.

43:45.915 --> 43:47.337
I don't understand. It's baffling.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.760
I mean, there's something for everyone
in that show.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.463
Is it the black and white baby or...

43:51.546 --> 43:53.548
Oh, that's my favourite.
I love the black and white baby.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.928
It's bloody hilarious.

43:55.007 --> 43:57.260
I mean, we've got dolphins
pulling knickers off girls

43:57.343 --> 43:59.812
for goodness sakes.
I mean, what's not to like?

43:59.971 --> 44:02.941
Excuse me, Mr Raymond, I've got
a gentleman on the phone for you.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.016
He says he's your son.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.227
Well, just take his number.

44:06.811 --> 44:08.154
I get a lot of crank calls.

44:08.729 --> 44:12.529
Well, we've got to make sure
that Fiona's next show is a knockout.

44:12.608 --> 44:14.235
- Yeah.
- We have to...

44:14.318 --> 44:16.741
make as big a splash as possible.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.915
Bigger than those damn dolphins.

44:20.158 --> 44:21.535
My name is Paul Raymond.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.494
This is Fiona Richmond.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.209
Fiona Richmond is starring

44:26.330 --> 44:29.880
in the West End farce Let's Get Laid,

44:30.418 --> 44:32.921
starting this Thursday night.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.180
If you enjoy, as I do,

44:35.256 --> 44:36.553
looking at nude ladies,

44:36.632 --> 44:38.555
please do come along.
You shan't be disappointed.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.977
(woman) That's disgusting.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.895
(Paul) No, it's not disgusting.
It's perfectly natural.

44:41.971 --> 44:45.521
If it's good enough for Lady Godiva,
it's good enough for Fiona Richmond.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.819
That's enough now.
Enough fun. Get off.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.771
-(Fiona) Sorry, everyone.
- Come on, you've had your laughs.

44:50.188 --> 44:53.442
Come on. All right, get rid
of the horse, it's blocking the road.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.500
- Hi. Hello.
-(Carl) Lady Godiva.

45:04.327 --> 45:06.421
- How are you?
- Oh, it went brilliantly.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.672
Paul. Fiona. Let's get laid.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.216
(glasses clinking)

45:11.083 --> 45:12.551
(crowd cheering)

45:15.296 --> 45:16.889
(cheering continues)

45:24.639 --> 45:27.313
(Paul) I'd rather see a beautiful lady
with her top off

45:27.850 --> 45:29.648
than a middle-aged man
with his pants down.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.196
I mean, who wants to see Brian Rix
with his trousers down all the time?

45:32.271 --> 45:33.739
(Fiona) Me!

45:33.814 --> 45:38.365
Well, well, well. Deborah Raymond.
I didn't know you were here.

45:38.611 --> 45:40.488
- Hello. You look gorgeous.
- Oh, hello.

45:40.571 --> 45:43.040
Oh, you were wonderful this evening.

45:43.449 --> 45:44.575
- Don't, I'm hardly in it.
- No...

45:44.659 --> 45:46.411
This is all down to you.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.329
Mwah! Hello, Mr Raymond.

45:48.788 --> 45:52.759
Pa's really happy and
it's a smash hit, isn't it?

45:52.833 --> 45:53.834
Mmm-hmm.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.633
You're a very lucky man, Paul,

45:55.711 --> 45:58.806
getting to share your bed with
such a beautiful and talented woman.

45:58.881 --> 46:01.475
- Are you flirting with my girlfriend?
- Ah, I might be.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.682
Should I be jealous?

46:03.844 --> 46:05.596
Well, that's up to you.

46:06.722 --> 46:08.690
How are the Follies going?

46:09.016 --> 46:11.565
Oh, Tony, I don't want to talk about it.

46:11.894 --> 46:14.568
Well, my apartment's right at the top,
so there's very little light pollution.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.320
You can actually
see the stars from the bed.

46:16.399 --> 46:17.651
I'd love to see it.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.527
Are you all right, Debs? Are you okay?

46:20.069 --> 46:21.446
Tired.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.952
And I also have a sun...
sunbed above the bed

46:24.031 --> 46:25.408
so you can get a tan at the same time.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.744
I have something that'll cheer you up.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.664
- Have to do it quick, right.
- Yeah.

46:30.746 --> 46:33.420
This way... Trumpet. Toot-toot!
This way, right?

46:34.500 --> 46:36.002
(inhaling deeply)

46:36.294 --> 46:38.296
Ha! There you go.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.719
(Kate) Wow, it's amazing!

46:48.848 --> 46:52.318
Ah! Home at last.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.565
(laughing)

46:53.978 --> 46:56.197
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

46:56.772 --> 46:58.490
I'm so glad you guys love each other.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.364
- And, er... and I like you a lot.
-(laughing)

47:00.443 --> 47:01.786
(Fiona) Wouldn't it be awful
if we didn't?

47:01.861 --> 47:03.408
- And I like you a lot.
- Good.

47:05.865 --> 47:07.037
(knocking)

47:07.491 --> 47:09.414
- Here's Debbie.
- Hello.

47:10.578 --> 47:12.046
- Hello, darling.
-(laughs)

47:14.540 --> 47:17.510
Do you want us to, um, head on
when she... when she comes in?

47:17.835 --> 47:21.339
- Uh, yes. Yes, if you wouldn't mind.
-(Carl) Could be a little bit awkward.

47:21.422 --> 47:22.514
- Hello.
- Hi.

47:22.631 --> 47:23.974
- How are you?
- Hello.

47:24.091 --> 47:26.890
- Come, have a seat.
-(Debbie) Oh, thank you, Carl.

47:27.011 --> 47:28.433
- There we are.
- Hi.

47:30.056 --> 47:31.524
Thank you.

47:32.099 --> 47:34.227
- Would you like a drop?
- Yes, please.

47:34.310 --> 47:35.903
- How are you?
- How's the voice?

47:35.978 --> 47:38.982
It's okay. It was a bit hoarse
when lwoke up this morning, yeah.

47:39.148 --> 47:40.274
(Paul) It doesn't sound hoarse.

47:40.399 --> 47:41.651
And, more importantly,
you don't look like a horse.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.327
-(Debbie laughs)
-(Carl) Yeah, you certainly don't.

47:43.569 --> 47:45.196
Not at this moment in time.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.031
Pineapple juice is what you want
for the throat.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.541
Tony, we ought to, uh...

47:49.116 --> 47:50.459
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- See you at the bar.

47:50.534 --> 47:52.081
Just a second.

47:52.161 --> 47:53.834
- See you in a little bit.
- See you in a bit.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.665
Apparently, as well,
if you have chocolate

47:55.748 --> 47:56.874
it's good for your voice.

47:56.957 --> 47:58.425
It soothes it.

47:59.126 --> 48:01.629
Um, I was thinking, uh,
we should think, er...

48:01.712 --> 48:04.010
of perhaps finding another vehicle
for your talents.

48:04.173 --> 48:05.891
I really like the Follies, though.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.348
I know. I just think, you know,
we should find something else.

48:08.636 --> 48:10.479
I don't think we should.
I really enjoy it

48:10.554 --> 48:13.774
-and I really enjoy it every night.
- I'm thinking of cancelling the show.

48:14.517 --> 48:16.861
The public were not ready.

48:16.936 --> 48:19.530
They didn't understand it,
they didn't get it. More fool them.

48:20.523 --> 48:23.527
I mean, is it my...
is it my fault?

48:23.609 --> 48:25.657
No, it's not.
Of course it's not your fault, no.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.864
It was haemorrhaging cash, you know.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.075
I've got to balance the books,
you know, that's...

48:32.535 --> 48:34.378
Well, what am I gonna do now, Pa?

48:34.620 --> 48:37.248
I want to be able to act
and I want to be able to sing.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.174
And I was doing that
and now everyone's going to...

48:39.250 --> 48:40.376
Don't cry.

48:40.459 --> 48:43.929
But they're going to know that
I was in the show that you put me in

48:44.004 --> 48:46.883
and I wasn't good enough
and now nobody's going to hire me

48:46.966 --> 48:48.513
in anything else ever again.

48:48.676 --> 48:49.893
Don't cry.

48:49.969 --> 48:54.145
I'm sorry, Pa, but I'm upset
about what you've just told me!

48:54.223 --> 48:56.726
But don't cry!
The show's losing money!

48:57.435 --> 49:01.531
I can't haemorrhage cash
just because you want to sing.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.575
Don't cry, there's nothing to cry about.

49:04.650 --> 49:07.278
- I can't help crying, I'm sorry.
- There's nothing to cry about!

49:07.361 --> 49:08.783
(sobbing) I'm sorry.

49:09.113 --> 49:12.162
(stutters) Dry your tears. Come on.
Come on, dry your tears.

49:12.491 --> 49:13.913
(waiter) Anything else for Miss Raymond?

49:14.326 --> 49:15.873
Can I have some champagne?

49:16.328 --> 49:17.921
(waiter) Would you like
another bottle of champagne?

49:17.997 --> 49:19.419
Yes. Yes, please, Carl.

49:20.666 --> 49:21.713
(muffled sobbing)

49:21.792 --> 49:23.294
(Paul) Your mascara's running.

49:23.502 --> 49:27.723
I'm just gonna go, um...
I'm just gonna go to the loo.

49:35.097 --> 49:36.895
(overlapping chatter)

49:40.769 --> 49:43.272
Tony, do you have, um, a pick-me-up?

49:43.814 --> 49:46.488
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- I'm okay. Yeah.

49:46.567 --> 49:48.569
Yeah, thank you. Thanks.

49:50.321 --> 49:52.244
(Carl) Didn't take that so well.
(Tony) No, she didn't.

49:53.115 --> 49:54.583
I think you should watch that.

49:55.284 --> 49:58.003
- Oh, she's fine. She's a big girl.
- She's a kid.

49:59.079 --> 50:00.547
(toilet flushing)

50:13.219 --> 50:14.812
(upbeat jazz music)

50:22.603 --> 50:23.855
-(Fiona) Hi.
- Good evening, Tony.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.443
Evening.

50:26.982 --> 50:27.983
Deb?

50:28.817 --> 50:30.694
(Debbie) Um, I'll have
a vodka tonic, thank you.

50:31.278 --> 50:32.404
(Tony) And a scotch, please.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.334
-It's quite phallic, isn't it?
- Yes.

50:37.409 --> 50:40.788
If my penis was shaped like a saxophone
I'd seek urgent medical attention.

50:41.163 --> 50:42.164
There's Pa over there

50:43.040 --> 50:44.462
with those girls.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.301
They look about 12 years old.

50:46.502 --> 50:47.970
I tell you, I did love the show, but...

50:48.337 --> 50:49.805
You know what he's like.

50:49.922 --> 50:51.640
Yeah, I do know what he's like.
That's what pisses me off.

50:52.466 --> 50:55.390
Well, I've got some hard feeling.
Well, I will have later...

50:55.719 --> 50:57.642
Look, come on, let's do a line.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.690
(Fiona) Is she angry with Daddy?

51:00.891 --> 51:02.313
Okay-

51:03.435 --> 51:05.358
Keep these two lovely dishes
on the boil.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.149
'Cause I'm working up
quite a large appetite.

51:08.315 --> 51:09.316
Excuse me.

51:09.650 --> 51:11.152
Oh, do you mind?

51:17.700 --> 51:19.168
(laughing)

51:21.412 --> 51:23.414
Oh, hi. (clears throat) Er, right.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.795
(stutters) This isn't
what it looks like, obviously.

51:25.874 --> 51:28.502
No, we... we were literally
just having a snog in the ladies.

51:28.586 --> 51:30.554
No. No, no, no. Whoa! No, no, no.
We were just...

51:30.629 --> 51:31.926
Where did you get this?

51:33.215 --> 51:35.183
If you're just buying it
off some random guy in the street,

51:35.259 --> 51:36.511
you're crazy. It's junk.

51:36.594 --> 51:39.347
If you're gonna do this kind of thing,
get the good stuff.

51:39.430 --> 51:41.979
Yeah, well, that's mine, Paul,
so it is the good stuff, so...

51:42.850 --> 51:45.478
Oh, right. Well, good.

51:46.270 --> 51:50.275
But thank you for your advice.
I will remember that forever.

51:51.567 --> 51:53.114
- Tony, uh, take her home.
- Pa.

51:53.569 --> 51:54.946
- Come on, Debs. Come on.
- Are you being serious?

51:55.112 --> 51:57.661
No, this is the first time
I've been happy all daylong.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.287
- Come on, Debbie. Look, this is...
- Dad...

51:59.366 --> 52:00.538
(Tony) I'll put you in a cab.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.416
(Debbie) Go have fun
with your four-year-old friends.

52:02.745 --> 52:06.750
- And you're just being an old man.
- Yeah, and you've made me an old man.

52:23.807 --> 52:29.280
All of us are in the gutter.
But some of us are looking at the stars.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.698
'(Q/TU Wow.
-(kissing)

52:31.774 --> 52:32.775
(Paul sighs)

52:33.108 --> 52:35.031
That was Oscar Wilde,
by the way, said that.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.953
- I know.
-(9i99liﬂ9)

52:41.867 --> 52:43.289
(Paul) Well, I don't mind
pushing the envelope,

52:43.369 --> 52:44.461
you know, taking a risk.

52:44.787 --> 52:46.289
I don't want to show too much pink.

52:46.372 --> 52:47.715
Of course. It's gonna be classy.

52:47.956 --> 52:50.129
-(Paul) No penetration.
-No, no, no, no. No, no. No.

52:50.209 --> 52:52.803
- If it's interesting we can give it a...
-"interesting"?

52:53.003 --> 52:55.472
This is an opportunity
for us to re-write

52:55.547 --> 52:57.549
the cultural history of this nation.

52:57.758 --> 52:59.385
And these girls are prepared to do that?

52:59.510 --> 53:00.636
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.523
-(Tony) Okay, a bit too much tease.
-(camera clicking)

53:08.727 --> 53:10.695
Let's take 'em down. Down.
That's good, that's it.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.273
Back against the wall.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.403
I want to see something.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.777
I don't want to think
I might be seeing something.

53:15.859 --> 53:16.860
I want to see it.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.201
Lovely, that's great. That's good.

53:19.446 --> 53:20.663
(camera clicking)

53:20.906 --> 53:22.908
if you come... Yeah. That's it.

53:24.952 --> 53:25.999
No, that's good.

53:26.286 --> 53:28.960
That's it. This isn't...
It's not Germany. So we'll just...

53:29.581 --> 53:31.879
That's it, that's it. Beautiful.

53:32.835 --> 53:35.634
Look at that. I fucking love this girl.

53:35.754 --> 53:37.597
We've got to use her again,
she's amazing.

53:37.965 --> 53:39.217
- Can I have a look, please?
-(Paul) Yes, please do.

53:39.299 --> 53:41.347
- I'm very worried about this.
- Oh, Paul.

53:41.593 --> 53:43.436
(Paul) Are we going to
run into problems with that?

53:43.595 --> 53:44.972
-(Tony) No...
-(chuckles) I think we are going to

53:45.055 --> 53:48.810
run into severe problems
with half of these images, I'd say.

53:49.184 --> 53:50.185
-(publisher 2) Yes.
- Why?

53:50.269 --> 53:51.486
(publisher 1) She's got her bum
in your face here.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.405
You can see her bum-hole here.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.107
Right in your face.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.151
And, you know, I can't see
her middle finger there.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.032
So men are just gonna assume
that's inside her.

53:59.111 --> 54:00.112
- That's obscene.
- Really?

54:00.195 --> 54:02.493
- Well, it's not in her fanny.
- I don't... I don't remember that.

54:02.573 --> 54:03.950
(publisher 1) Do we need
to take these kind of risks?

54:04.032 --> 54:05.659
-(Tony) Yes!
- On the day it wasn't inside her.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.086
(Tony) No,
it's definitely not inside her.

54:07.202 --> 54:08.454
Not during the shoot, anyway.

54:08.537 --> 54:11.541
I think we have to ask ourselves
if we're pornographers or not.

54:11.915 --> 54:14.885
With all due respect,
I do not publish, uh, pornography.

54:15.002 --> 54:18.131
I, earlier today, obtained
these Scandinavian publications

54:18.213 --> 54:20.090
from, uh, a Soho outlet.

54:20.382 --> 54:24.558
Now these are what I call pornography.

54:24.636 --> 54:26.263
Héstspela, for example,

54:26.346 --> 54:28.314
which, you know,
is literally "Horseplay"

54:28.974 --> 54:31.523
in, um...Scandinavian.

54:31.810 --> 54:33.437
And, by the way,
this is not your common or garden

54:33.520 --> 54:36.569
equestrian publication,
I can assure you of that. Um...

54:36.815 --> 54:41.036
The Obscene Publications Squad today
impounded more than 300,000 copies

54:41.111 --> 54:43.079
of Paul Raymond's magazine Men Only.

54:43.363 --> 54:46.833
It's the largest amount of pornography
ever seized in Britain.

54:47.201 --> 54:48.999
(Carl) Tony, I think
you should let me go first.

54:49.077 --> 54:50.624
Ah, you'll only depress him, Carl.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.877
(Carl) It'd be better if you let me
do the talking.

54:53.499 --> 54:54.716
- Paul.
-(Carl) Paul.

54:54.792 --> 54:57.841
Those joyless, puritanical bastards.

54:58.170 --> 54:59.638
(Carl) Yeah, I know.

54:59.713 --> 55:01.681
You know, they're the Roundheads
and we're the Cavaliers.

55:01.924 --> 55:03.050
Yeah, who won?

55:03.425 --> 55:05.143
(Paul) It's as if
masturbation doesn't exist.

55:05.260 --> 55:08.389
Think of one person who you can say
has never had a wank.

55:09.181 --> 55:12.025
-(Tony) Mother Teresa?
- All right, name me another person.

55:12.392 --> 55:13.985
-(Tony) Gandhi.
- Come on.

55:14.937 --> 55:16.359
(doorbell ringing)

55:19.608 --> 55:21.406
(Paul) Oh, Jenny,
it's all right, I'll get it.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.241
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

55:25.197 --> 55:26.665
(sighs)

55:30.619 --> 55:32.087
Darryl. Pleased to meet you.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.214
Come in.

55:34.665 --> 55:36.258
So you found us all right?

55:36.542 --> 55:37.964
Yeah, ljumped in a black cab at Euston.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.303
I'm here on business as well
as seeing you, you know.

55:40.379 --> 55:41.847
Oh, right. What kind of business?

55:41.922 --> 55:43.640
Uh, it's a job interview, yeah.

55:43.715 --> 55:45.137
(Paul) Right, very good.

55:45.217 --> 55:46.639
I like your flat.

55:46.718 --> 55:49.267
It's like something out of James Bond.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.064
(laughs) it is a bit.

55:51.139 --> 55:55.110
Yeah, what's the... what's the
guy called? Dr No. It's like, yeah.

55:55.269 --> 55:58.318
Yes, but it's a...
I don't have the white cat, I'm afraid.

55:58.438 --> 56:01.738
Yes. Uh, Ringo helped me
design it, actually.

56:01.817 --> 56:03.615
Ringo Starr from the Beatles.

56:03.694 --> 56:05.662
- Oh, you know him?
- Well, I know all the Beatles.

56:05.737 --> 56:07.785
Very friendly with them,
apart from Yoko.

56:08.407 --> 56:11.001
Now, Darryl, can I offer you
a glass of champagne?

56:11.285 --> 56:13.128
It's a very, very nice bottle.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.331
(stutters) Yeah, I've had it before.

56:16.081 --> 56:18.175
And by the way,
it's not Darryl, it's Derry.

56:18.542 --> 56:20.169
Okay, well, Derry it is.

56:20.669 --> 56:23.263
I changed my name many years ago.
I used to be called Geoffrey.

56:23.338 --> 56:24.555
- Geoffrey.
- Yes.

56:24.631 --> 56:25.632
(ice cubes rattle)

56:26.884 --> 56:28.306
(Derry) It's really nice.

56:29.970 --> 56:34.225
You know, for years I'd tell people
that you were dead.

56:35.100 --> 56:37.478
That's what Mum...
what Mum told me to say.

56:37.603 --> 56:40.652
And then I find out that
not only are you not dead,

56:40.731 --> 56:43.029
but you're Paul bloody Raymond.

56:43.108 --> 56:44.530
It's just...

56:44.943 --> 56:46.365
It's just, I don't know.

56:47.487 --> 56:49.865
Your mother was very young
when she fell pregnant.

56:50.407 --> 56:52.250
Yeah, she was, urn, 17.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.413
I, uh... (clears throat)
I kept up the maintenance payments.

56:55.787 --> 56:57.915
Thirty shillings a week until I was 21.

56:59.791 --> 57:01.008
Yes.

57:01.084 --> 57:03.303
You know, we even share
the same birthday.

57:03.712 --> 57:05.180
15th of November.

57:05.297 --> 57:07.516
Yes, it's quite a coincidence, isn't it?

57:07.633 --> 57:09.101
(Derry) Mmm.

57:09.468 --> 57:12.472
Yeah, so when I was...
blowing out candles on my birthday cake

57:12.554 --> 57:14.682
at some point during that day,
you'd be doing the same.

57:14.806 --> 57:18.481
Well, I haven't actually had a
birthday cake since 1958, but, uh...

57:19.978 --> 57:23.232
I've got some old photos
if you want to see 'em. I've got, um...

57:23.857 --> 57:25.404
One of you and Mum.

57:29.571 --> 57:30.993
(Paul) Good Lord.

57:32.741 --> 57:34.368
We both look so young.

57:35.911 --> 57:38.334
Your mother is a fine-looking woman.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.383
Yeah. Yeah.

57:43.502 --> 57:45.880
I've got some pictures of me
if you want to see them.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.385
Yes, of course. Please do.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.389
Show you these...

58:02.020 --> 58:03.647
There's another one of you and Mum.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.697
(Paul) That's Southend.
You can tell by the, er... by the pier.

58:07.859 --> 58:11.534
Did a lot of the seaside resorts,
when we were touring.

58:13.198 --> 58:14.700
(chuckles)

58:14.783 --> 58:16.456
- It's so funny.
- Mmm.

58:17.119 --> 58:19.713
Uh... And that's you, is it?

58:20.414 --> 58:23.509
Yeah. That's... that's me
at the seaside.

58:23.709 --> 58:25.336
(Paul) Yes, you've got
a very characterful face.

58:25.419 --> 58:26.420
-(Derry) Thanks.
- Yes.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.807
- There she is again.
- Yeah.

58:30.882 --> 58:32.350
- That's you as a baby, is it?
- Yeah.

58:32.467 --> 58:34.265
I think I was about three weeks.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.347
(Paul) Yes, she looks very happy.

58:40.809 --> 58:42.277
Such a long time ago.

58:45.188 --> 58:47.361
(sighs) Another life.

58:49.484 --> 58:52.863
Yeah, urn, thanks for dinner.
It's really nice to meet you.

58:52.946 --> 58:55.665
Well, absolutely.
And thank you for getting in touch

58:55.741 --> 58:57.334
and I thought it was very worthwhile.

58:58.201 --> 58:59.623
Well, goodbye, Derry.

59:01.496 --> 59:02.918
Yeah, goodbye, Paul.

59:03.123 --> 59:04.545
(Paul) Take care.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.386
(elevator bell dings)

59:21.433 --> 59:23.527
(porter) Good afternoon, Miss Raymond.
(Debbie) Hi.

59:53.215 --> 59:54.683
I'm Paul Raymond.

59:57.344 --> 59:59.267
I am Paul Raymond.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.566
I am Paul Raymond.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.368
I'm Geoffrey Quinn.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.704
(J1 Let's Stick Together by Roxy Music)

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.961
Aperitif, anyone?

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:33.092
-(all cheering)
-(man) Boss man.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.764
(Paul) I really want to emphasise

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.467
-we only do coke socially.
- Absolutely, yes.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:38.969
We just happen to be
very sociable people.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:41.896
I like to do it anti-socially myself.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:43.440
(laughter)

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.233
(overlapping chatter)

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.687
No, no, no, no. Not for me.

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:53.741
(women exclaiming)

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.412
Okay, I'd like to propose a toast

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:02.414
to the one millionth copy of Men Only
sold in the United States of America.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.914
(all cheering)

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.079
It's called the "matador look".

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.384
Oh, my back. I'm joking, I'm joking.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.470
What are you talking about?

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.301
(overlapping chatter)

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.729
(Paul) This...
this is where it all happens.

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.697
(J1 Everyone's a Winner
by Hot Chocolate)

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:44.242
(inhaling)

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:23.623
We need to talk.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:26.830
(clears throat)

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.503
(sniffs) That's never
a good start to a conversation.

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:31.589
I'm leaving, Paul.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.426
And I mean it this time.
I'm tired of it.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:37.845
I just want a normal life.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.428
Normal life is for normal people.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.887
Is there anybody else?

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.059
No.

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.981
Captain of the cruise ship in St Tropez?

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:50.809
No.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.610
Cocktail waiter in Jamaica?

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.274
No.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.323
Is it me?

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:04.576
Don't answer that. (chuckles)

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:08.042
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:10.749
Is it something I've done?

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:15.508
Something I've, uh, not done?

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.549
Something I could do?

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.256
You're never gonna change, Paul.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:24.346
Where will you go?

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:26.845
I'm going to go and live with Debbie.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.481
Debbie knew you were going to leave me
before I did?

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.479
- You wanted us to be friends.
-(sighs)

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.604
Well, uh, I own Debbie's flat

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:39.862
and, urn, technically
she's not allowed to sublet.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:41.693
- It's in the lease.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.243
J1 Anyone who ever loved

01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:50.748
J1 Could look at me

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:54.127
J1 And know that I love you

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.880
J1 Anyone who ever dreamed

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:00.754
J1 Could look at me

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:05.054
J1 And know I dream of you

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:10.347
J1 Knowing I love you so

J1 Anyone who had a heart

(doorbell rings)

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:37.711
Pa?

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:39.838
Pa?

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:47.934
Are you all right?

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:52.772
I don't know.

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:56.442
Oh, dear.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:05.159
Did Fiona send you?

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:08.951
No, she didn't.

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:16.166
You haven't got
a temperature or anything.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:18.665
I just feel old.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.554
I don't think you're old.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:33.397
Oh, Pa. You can't just lie here
and feel miserable all day, can you?

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:35.936
Yes.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:37.396
No.

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:41.439
Come on. You're getting up.
And we're going out!

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.403
You're going to feel much better.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.278
I'll get you some clothes.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:54.118
Come on, you're Paul Raymond.
You're not Geoffrey bloody Quinn.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.416
Let's have some caffeine, first of all.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:03.172
And then let's go and
have some champagne.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.842
Go to L'Escargot for dinner,
and we'll go out to a club

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.092
and we'll have lots and lots
and lots of fun.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.590
Just what the doctor ordered.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.767
Did you hear that, Chris?

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.561
I'm afraid it's going to be
a late one tonight.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.722
Good, I've been missing them.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.275
(Debbie) It's just beautiful
at night-time.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.228
(Paul) Everything looks beautiful
at night-time.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.563
-(Debbie) No, this.
-(Paul laughs)

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.067
This is beautiful.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:28.277
(Paul) Henry VIII used to
use this area as his hunting ground.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:30.995
And "Soho" was his battle cry.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.244
- So-ho.
- So-ho, you know.

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.495
- So-ho.
-(imitating horn blowing)

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:37.498
(howls) So-ho!

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:38.999
(laughing)

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:40.751
Sorry.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.666
(howls) So-ho!

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.797
(people cheering)

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:47.129
I own all of you!

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:49.923
(chuckles) Well, actually,
the Queen owns the pavement, darling.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:51.932
No. Soho!

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.553
(J1 disco)

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:57.856
(waiter) Anything else, Mr Raymond?

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:04.612
I think the magazine needs a revamp.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.363
It's a little old-hat and I think
we need to make some changes.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.111
- Do you have any big changes in mind?
- Yes.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:14.323
Yes, I think we need to, er...
fire Fiona.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:18.164
(Debbie) What are you two doing
sitting here like two wallflowers?

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.999
I know what you're thinking.
"Her father's come to pick her up."

01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:25.129
(laughter)

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:27.051
But, no, I'm here under m own volition.
Y

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.963
I am here to dance.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.132
He is actually here to pick her up.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:33.424
(Paul) Les girls.

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:35.385
- Yeah.
-(girls) Whoo!

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:39.518
We're looking for new beautiful girls
and we were wondering if you knew any.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:40.940
(laughter)

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.776
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
You're very, very beautiful, all of you.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:45.945
(blows kisses) Sexy ladies!

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.489
You wouldn't think I was 35.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:58.367
I'm here to tell you about
the re-launch of Men Only.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.831
Paul, how do you think Fiona feels
about getting the sack?

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.292
I don't know how she felt. Um...

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:06.545
All I know is it's, of course,
always unpleasant

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:08.126
when you have to fire somebody.

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:10.967
Is Men Only gonna become
more pornographic?

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:15.433
It is not pornographic
and it will never be pornographic.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.510
Is Men Only degrading to women?

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.356
- No, it is not.
-(chuckling)

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.518
(Paul) Oh, that's fabulous.

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:26.314
(Tony laughs)

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:27.611
(Tony) Yeah, that's good. That's great.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.359
Think it could be a little more Sapphic?

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:32.071
He wants you to just lick her.

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.576
Turn round, Nicole, go down and...

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:34.777
That's it, yes!

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:36.033
(Paul) You're doing a great job, girls.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.408
Let's have a quid pro quo.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:38.488
Huh?

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:40.450
- He means, urn, the other way...
- Do it for each other.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.533
Yeah, do it for each other.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:44.830
Little more sensual.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:46.163
Can we get some, uh, Vaseline?

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:48.504
(cameraman) Yeah.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:49.880
We don't want the jar in the shot.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.294
Yeah, that's it.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:52.549
(Paul) Excellent, yeah.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:55.923
I do like the blue shoes.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.600
(Chloe) I really like them.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.848
- I want Tony to get me some.
- Whatever colour, I don't mind.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:01.929
I don't normally see the colour.
They're usually behind my head.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.765
- What, on a shelf?
-(Tony laughs) No.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.813
No, I can feel 'em,
I just can't see 'em.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:08.064
- Do you like these, Chloe?
- I think it'd look better maybe

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.272
if there was two blondes, though,
instead of the brunette.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:11.732
I'm blond, we'll do it with me.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.738
We could always do two blondes
and then you in the middle or something.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:15.818
- You like that idea, Tony?
-(Tony) No.

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:16.948
- I do.
-(Paul) You see,

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:18.154
she knows which side
her bread's buttered.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.453
And it wouldn't just be the bread
that's buttered.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.531
(Tony) on!

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:21.992
Have you seen Last Tango In Paris?

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.622
- I haven't.
-(mimics Marlon Brando) Pass the butter.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:27.501
Pass, pass... Pass the butter.

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:30.959
Hey, pass the butter.
And the Worcester sauce.

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.502
Wouldn't the Worcester Sauce sting?

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.587
Precisely.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.514
(normal voice) No, he wouldn't
use a word like that, would he?

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:37.932
(mimics Marlon Brando)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you got it.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.513
-(laughs)
-(Paul) Something like that.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.019
(telephone ringing)

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.653
Hello.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:53.568
Ward... Ward West 8.

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:55.696
- Straight up there on the right.
- Thank you.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:58.528
- He knows what he's doing?
- Yeah...

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.158
Um, excuse me,
I'm looking for Deborah Raymond.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.623
- Oh, she's just through there, sir.
- Thank you.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:04.830
Hello. You must be Jonathan.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.832
Yes. And you are?

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.128
- Paul...
- Raymond.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.330
Precisely.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.173
Is she all right?

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:14.628
Uh, yeah, she's, er, sleeping
at the moment. They gave her something.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.681
(Paul) So, um, what happened?
Enlighten me, please.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:19.716
I heard a crash
so I went to have a look.

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:21.642
Um, I found Debbie.

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:23.845
Her boyfriend lives
in my block of flats.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:26.856
Um, and she looked pretty messed-up

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:29.442
so I, er...
brought her here, you know.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.312
Well, thanks. Thank you.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.147
Hi.

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:35.356
Good evening.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:37.192
Have you met Jonathan, Pa?

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:39.243
(Paul) Yeah, we have been speaking, yes.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:43.073
You know he rescued me,
like a knight in a fairy tale?

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:46.459
Yeah. Sounds like
you're severely concussed.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.003
He writes songs.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.589
He's going to write a song
for me to sing.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:52.798
That's the plan.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:53.916
It's kismet.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:56.715
I thought there was already
a song called Kismet.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.175
What songs have you written?

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.256
Uh, mainlyjingles for commercials.

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:04.556
I'm very good friends with the Beatles,
apart from Yoko.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.105
Ringo actually designed
my, er, apartment.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:10.354
Cool.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.355
I thought you were going to be
a theatre impresario like your Pa.

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:16.607
- What's happened with that?
- Oh, I'm gonna do that as well.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:20.277
You know, I can do whatever I like

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:24.247
because I'm feeling lucky.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:26.290
(Debbie laughs)

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.247
Six, take one.

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:32.748
(interviewer) Some people will say
you're only able to produce this play

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.332
because your father is Paul Raymond.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.423
Pa's renting the theatre to us
for a thousand quid a week.

01:11:38.085 --> 01:11:40.634
J1 You and I have found a world

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:43.596
J1 Where dreams will come true

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:49.273
I could just sit around eating cake
because I'm Paul Raymond's daughter,

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.685
but that's not my way, really.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.269
I'm... I'm a worker.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.607
Debbie is a very hard-working
professional producer.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:00.574
There's no doubt in my mind that...

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.573
Women Behind Bars
will be a huge success.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:06.532
J1 ...together, you and I...

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:09.580
(engineer) That's fantastic.
Just some, uh, technical issues our end,

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.377
but you're sounding great.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:16.508
'Cause people like you are like the
slime at the bottom of the shower stall.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.135
After a while, it gets so thick

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:23.093
all the Dutch cleanser in the world
can't get it off.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:27.185
If you don't love me,
you don't love everybody.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.477
(chuckles)

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:33.225
(Paul) I'd like to propose a toast
to my new impresario

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:35.605
and my always-gorgeous leading lady.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:37.604
- Cheers.
-(all) Cheers.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.781
I'd like to propose a toast of my own

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.324
to...

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:44.699
marriage and to Jonathan.

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.213
Thank you.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.591
(waitress) Good evening, Mr Raymond.
(Paul) Now, this is Jean.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:09.185
(Paul) America suits you.
Your tan's almost as deep as mine.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:12.146
I'd have said it's
twice as deep, actually.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.098
- You like my hair'?
-(Paul) Yes, very nice.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:15.975
It's got a sort of a...

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.310
a Myra Hindley effect.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.813
Say what you like about her,
you know, she was a looker.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:22.987
So, Howard, are you missing home?

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.035
America's more like home for me.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.737
America's a big market for us now.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:28.946
- Mmm.
-Isn't it?

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.998
Tony's doing a really fantastic job.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.825
He's really making quite a fortune

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.458
-which is great for us. So...
-it's great. Yeah.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:36.921
- Yeah.
-(Howard) Yeah.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.377
He's sort of like a son to Pa.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.386
Howard, er...
has made no secret of the fact

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:45.634
he's not particularly interested
in the business.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:49.388
- Not like you, Debbie, is he?
- No, you prefer, sort of,

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:52.095
-playing tennis and...
- Shame about your tits, really.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:54.055
Otherwise you could
work in the Revue Bar

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.061
or be in Men Only, like your friend.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:57.688
Fiona?

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:58.984
- Whatever she calls herself now.
- Yeah.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.904
She's not in Men Only. Um...
Pa sacked her, so...

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:04.612
Oh. I thought she sacked Dad.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.489
No, you're wrong. I sacked her,
so you're wrong about that.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.570
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's enough, you two.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.373
Come along,
we're supposed to be celebrating.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:13.540
Y3)'-

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.034
(glass tinkling)

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.332
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Could I have your attention, please?

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.960
My name is Paul Raymond.
I am the...

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.882
-(shushing)
- Thank you. ...er, father of the bride.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:24.510
- That's what you think.
-(laughter)

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:28.680
Deborah, you look super,
you've got a smashing figure,

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.137
and I'm very proud of you.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.470
She may not be a double-D

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.021
but, to me, she'll always be three-D.

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.600
- My darling daughter Deborah. Ah.
-(guests) Aw.

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:41.860
Someone came up to me earlier
outside and said,

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:45.236
"I understand that the wedding
cost in excess of £75,000."

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.362
I said, "Please don't
talk about money, it's vulgar.

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:51.196
"And anyway," I added, "their wedding
was actually closer to £95,000."

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.572
(scattered laughter)

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:53.823
(inhaling)

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.492
(sniffling)

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.871
J1 And put the freshness back

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:01.213
J1 Do the shake and vac...

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.503
- I love that! I love that. Oh!
- Guilty as charged.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.422
Hi.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:10.260
(Jean) Don't call me Mum, call me Jean.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.717
Well, you're very, very, very gorgeous

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.186
and I'm very proud to have you
as my son-in-law.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.897
- I can't believe you're my...
- Am I interrupting you two?

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:19.561
- Huh?
- Hi, Debs.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.104
Hi.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:23.444
Hi. I, um...

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.191
- What?
- I'll see you later.

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.194
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you later.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.363
(Jonathan) She's great.
(Debbie) She's unbelievable.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.156
You should get a room, you two.
Why don't you do that?

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.822
- You been dancing?
- No, I haven't been dancing, Jonathan.

01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:35.531
I've just been watching my mother
dance with you.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:37.283
(Jonathan) Don't be cross with me.
It wasn't me that was...

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.994
I'm not cross, Jonathan. I'm not 14.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:41.704
Welcome to the family, Jonathan.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.665
-(softly) Cheers.
- You've been welcomed.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.422
Our condolences on this sad day.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.501
(Jonathan chuckles)

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.379
This is more like a fucking funeral.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.344
So, what are you doing later on?

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:54.850
Probably going to bed.

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:57.219
-(Paul) With me?
- No.

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.356
-(Paul) Uh, alone?
-(chuckles) Probably.

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:05.562
Mmm. I mean, my bed's too big
to sleep in all by myself.

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:08.823
Well, that was always
the problem, wasn't it?

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:12.528
I prefer a bed big enough
forjust two people.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:14.820
Oh.

01:16:15.529 --> 01:16:17.827
You know what?
I want you to have my children.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:21.957
Seriously. They're outside in the car.
You can take 'em now if you like.

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:23.253
(both laugh)

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:25.915
(wolf whistles)

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:28.505
Who is that foxy lady?

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.837
- Oh, it might be me.
-(laughing)

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.844
You are looking absolutely sensational.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.301
Oh, thank you very much.

01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:38.260
Are you feeling very lonely
now you've lost your girlfriend?

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:41.689
- Well, I can always get a girl.
- Well, I certainly know that.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.309
(Paul) No, seriously,
you're looking better than ever.

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:47.235
Better than women half your age.
That's a compliment, by the way.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:48.730
Cheeky bugger.

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:52.446
Do I look good enough
to be on the cover of Men Only?

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.823
If you want to be. Is that an offer?

01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:56.578
Might be.

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:00.457
Are we ready, Mr Bailey?

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.126
(Paul) Hop on.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.794
(Jean) Which way, backwards or forwards?

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:05.416
(Paul) Which way do you want to start?

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:06.543
I'm gonna do both, so...

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:07.631
Right, look back at me.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:08.878
Take the bloody picture.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:10.588
(camera clicking)

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:16.140
Where the hell is Tony, by the way?
(stammers) There's no make-up artist.

01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:17.341
No black and white film stock.

01:17:17.424 --> 01:17:19.347
What's going on? What's wrong with him?

01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:20.848
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:22.350
Desire me.

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:24.348
Oh, Golly gosh!

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.058
Change of scenery. Great.

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.269
Did you know Debbie's doing drugs?

01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:30.696
- Who said that?
- Well, is it true?

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:33.650
She's an adult.
She can take care of herself.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:34.733
(knocking on door)

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.318
Come in.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:38.655
Anna, will you tell me the truth?
You're another woman. Do I look red?

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.990
- You look gorgeous.
- See?

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.000
I bet Fiona got hair and make-up.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.459
-(Paul) Oh, darling, just...
-(camera clicking)

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.833
Look at me. Look at me, darling.
We know what's under there.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.664
That's excellent. No love, just lust.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:50.420
(Tony) lwish I had half your talent

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:51.671
for manipulating people.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:54.424
-(Paul) Manipulate?
- She must want you back. Doesn't she?

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.637
She doesn't want me back.

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:58.842
She just wants to show me
that other men still desire her.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.177
Yeah, well, I desire her.
Fucking hell, look at that.

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.017
(Paul)
I'm thinking of taking a year off.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.518
- Oh, yeah?
-(Paul) Going to live in a monastery

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:06.645
like a monk.

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:07.850
(Tony) What, Rasputin?

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:09.226
(inhaling)

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:12.897
- That's very good stuff.
- Yeah. Only the best.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.990
Yeah, it's not too, er...
it's not too buzzy.

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:17.322
(Tony) He's good. He doesn't...
he doesn't cut it with any shit.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:21.242
(Tony)
We need to shift up a gear, right.

01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:23.245
The magazine needs to...
needs to stay on top.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:25.372
We've, uh... We're, you know...
We've dropped down to third, second.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:29.414
We're revving hard
but we're stuck on a hill or...

01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:31.043
I don't know, I don't know.

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:32.758
We've caught too many red lights
or whatever.

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:36.387
We need to put
the serious driving gloves on

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.263
because we don't...
we don't want to get, you know...

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.882
we don't want to get blisters,

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:43.056
uh, gripping the wheel too hard
whilst we're stuck...

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:45.437
Well, I think I know
what you're talking about.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.014
We need to be in the fast lane.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:48.440
(TOW) Yes.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.018
(overlapping chatter)

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:53.904
(inhaling)

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.867
I shouldn't bring my work home
with me, you know, Tony, huh.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.695
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo.

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.196
(laughing)

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:06.909
Can you not see
I am making great art here?

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:08.832
(moaning)

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:10.829
(inhaling)

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:14.587
Well, it's not the neatest line
I've ever set up!

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.592
That's fantastic.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.845
A sort of albino Supremes.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.343
Sort of Chicken Supreme.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:28.021
Paul Raymond, a name once
synonymous with sophistication,

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:32.352
has been accused by the Sunday Times
of organising prostitution

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.277
from one of his clubs in Soho,

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:35.525
the Pink Pussycat.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:36.651
(Paul) "Sex for sale."

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:37.902
I can't believe I bloody fell for it.

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:39.567
Nice picture of you.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:42.161
"Squalid side of Raymond's Soho."

01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:43.487
I am sorry, Paul.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:44.913
Good morning.

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:46.991
How does it feel to be exposed
as a common pimp?

01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:50.874
Well, I'm going to go to court,
and I will swear on a stack of Bibles

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:54.966
that these allegations bear no relation
to the way I conduct my business

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.758
in any shape or form.

01:19:57.001 --> 01:20:01.131
Not only do they ruin the reputation
of one of London's finest districts,

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.386
but they also bring down
property prices,

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:05.555
which I'm sure you'll understand
that I do not want.

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:08.846
Club looks good.

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:10.356
-(Tony) Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.267
- No, thanks.
-(Paul on film) Repeat the conclusion...

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.351
This is quality.

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:15.903
(inhaling deeply)

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.855
...imagine that my face is the camera

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:22.486
and I would like you to splay your legs
before the camera, my face.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.652
(clears throat)

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:27.373
Superb.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:29.041
(laughing)

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.877
- Is that funny?
-(Tony) It's hilarious.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.871
I'd love to see that girl's pussy

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:35.080
but there's an old man's head
in the way.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.292
-(Paul on film) That was excellent.
- I love the gestures.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.294
- They make you look like an air hostess.
- Funny-looking air hostess.

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:41.966
"Doors to manual."

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.594
(Tony) That's your new bird, Di, is it?

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:45.845
- Yes.
-(Tony) All right.

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:49.227
- Yeah, she's hot.
- Thank you.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:50.596
I'd fuck her.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:53.398
Tony, please.

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:54.896
Let me know when you've
finished with her, eh?

01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:56.477
Right, stop the... stop the film.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.607
Switch it off.

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.650
How many grams are you
getting through a day?

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:04.197
Why?

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.404
Because you've got to stop.
You're out of control.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.956
(laughs) Bollocks.
I do about half as much as you do.

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:11.041
(Paul) We both know that's rubbish.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:15.292
And even if it were true,
I don't turn up for work two days late.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:16.588
I don't insult the staff.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:20.167
Listen to me. I don't insult the staff.
I don't upset advertisers.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:23.504
And I certainly don't lose 10%
of US sales of Club International.

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:26.716
And I don't have a boss
because I am the boss.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.018
Yeah, I like you, Tony,
but you've got to clean up your act.

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:32.813
- And I'm telling you for your own good.
- Who's gonna take over the magazines?

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:35.186
- Deborah.
- No. (laughs)

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:39.027
No. No! Because she...
she's a psycho-woman.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.229
- You can't have a...
- Whoa. Tony.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:41.939
- That's enough.
- No. She's up and down like a yoyo.

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:45.447
- She does twice as much coke as I do.
-(Carl) No, she doesn't.

01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:46.994
- Yes, she does. She's...
- Tony...

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:49.660
No-one can stand her. She's talentless.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:52.082
If you weren't bankrolling her
she'd be nowhere. I'm sorry.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.830
(Carl) Zip it! Enough.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.126
I'm sorry, Paul,
I know she's your daughter

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:57.375
but she is nothing like you. Nothing.

01:21:57.454 --> 01:21:59.206
And she's nowhere near me.

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:00.381
- Carl?
-(Carl) Yes, Paul?

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:01.709
Sack him.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:04.553
- Wha... No, come on.
- Tony...

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:13.058
Before long, I think she will
take over the empire that I've built up.

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:15.351
But I wouldn't have said that once.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:18.401
She was very badly behaved

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.898
and almost impossible to control.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:24.858
But now I think she's found
the right balance between work and play.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:27.493
(Debbie) A lot of people still view him

01:22:27.568 --> 01:22:30.947
as very hard-edged and quite
a ruthless businessman, you know.

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:35.042
<i>But, um..- Yeah, I mean, I don't
see him that way. I'm his daughter.</i>

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:39.338
So, as far as I'm concerned,
he's my father and that's that, yeah.

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:43.008
(Paul) Now that Debbie has a child,
I think she'll be a great mother

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:47.714
and I do hope that her child brings her
as much pleasure as she has brought me.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.803
(screaming)

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.763
(midwife) All right.
Okay, just take the gas and air,

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:53.844
take the gas and air.
Good girl. Good girl.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.099
Breathe it in.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.894
In through your nose
and out through your mouth.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.358
Can I have more pethidine?

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.401
(midwife)
I can't give you any more just yet.

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.151
(groans) I'm really drug-tolerant.
I need it, please.

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:05.815
-(midwife) I'm sorry, love.
- Please.

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:07.366
Can you... Can you get the doctor?

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:10.115
- He's on the ward.
- No, can you get the doctor, please!

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.787
(Debbie groaning)

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:16.075
All right, love, you're doing
really well. You're doing great.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.956
No, can you do me a line?
Please, can I have a line?

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.958
- I really need it.
- I can't do that.

01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:22.711
- It's a hospital.
-(sobs) No, please, I really need it.

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:25.459
(Paul) I'll do you a very,
very, very small one.

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:34.051
(inhaling)

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:37.354
Hey, aren't you? Yes, you are.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.102
(Carl) A-ha! There he is!

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:46.356
(laughs) The grandfather of Soho!

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.781
(all cheering)

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:49.574
(Carl) All hail the King!

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.703
Champagne for everyone.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:54.780
(all cheering)

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.577
House champagne.

01:23:56.657 --> 01:23:57.874
(laughter)

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:03.672
I'd like to propose a toast, please,
to my new grand-daughter Fawn.

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:05.879
(all) To Fawn.
(woman) Cheers.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:08.837
- And, of course, my darling Deborah.
-(woman) And darling Deborah.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:13.515
- Evening, Mr Raymond.
-(Paul) Good evening.

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:19.020
Evening, Michelle.

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:20.681
The hair never moves!

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:22.983
No matter what Thatcher does!
And we're all watching!

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.685
Just locked, locked!

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:26.645
- Glued into position!
-(laughter)

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:29.402
She could have gone to Brixton
at the heart of the riots.

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:31.950
Paving stones would have bounced off it.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:33.902
The cops could have held her
as a battering ram.

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.372
The most insane head of hair. Oi!

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.828
Speaking of insane heads of hair,

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.409
it's our landlord, Paul Raymond.

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:42.415
Paul, how are you?
Good to have you here.

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:43.537
Who are you out with tonight, Paul?

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.746
Is that one of your dancers
or your daughter?

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.005
Daughter!

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:49.092
It doesn't matter, either way she's
gonna end the night being wanked over.

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:50.715
(audience laughs)

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:51.928
What did he just say?

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:56.259
He owns all of this because
he's a genius at turning that into that.

01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:57.934
(audience laughs)

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.809
Very clever man. Built on spunk.

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:05.150
He is a fantastic father to me.

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:07.648
Um, he's my best friend, really.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:13.363
I've kind of called him up
over the years with problems

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:15.577
at 4:00 in the morning
in ﬂoods of tears

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:18.451
and he's, um,
he's always been there to listen

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:20.498
and pick up the pieces.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:23.703
And he still does that now. (laughs)

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:34.972
Can you see what I'm doing, Pa?

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:39.014
(Paul) Just joining lots of lines
of coke up in a big circle.

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.309
(Debbie) No, I'm not.

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:42.016
I'm making a big

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.806
It's not a "C" for "coke", Pa.

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:47.396
(inhaling)

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:51.776
Um...

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:55.488
I'm making a "C" for "cancer".

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:58.703
What are you talking about?

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:03.450
Er...

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.120
I've got breast cancer.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.917
(Debbie sobbing)

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:22.019
-(Paul) It's gonna be all right.
-(sobbing) What am I gonna do?

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:23.596
(Paul) It's okay.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:24.805
What am I gonna do?

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:27.767
(Paul) Okay, we'll get treatment.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.233
We'll get some treatment.
It's gonna be all right.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:32.904
(sobbing)

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:51.006
Would you describe him
as a good father?

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:53.003
Yeah. He's a fantastic father.

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:56.715
I don't really know
of too many other people

01:26:56.795 --> 01:26:59.719
who have a relationship
like the one that we do.

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:01.596
I think it's quite rare, yeah.

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:06.222
Okay, I think that's
a good place to finish.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.690
- Thank you. Happy?
-(recordist) Yes, mate, sure thing.

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:10.312
Can you get Debbie's mic off, please?

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:12.269
Thanks very much, Paul.
Thanks for having us.

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:13.353
Thank you. Thank you kindly, yes.

01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:14.905
Sorry for interrupting your morning.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.948
No, no, it's very illuminating.

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:18.570
(chuckling)

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:21.574
Can you tell these are fake
on the camera?

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.496
Thank you.
I wasn't looking too closely.

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:24.573
(laughter)

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:28.870
They used to be much, much smaller.
I had to get them chopped off.

01:27:28.952 --> 01:27:32.673
I got the Big C,
and it's kind of ironic, really,

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:35.217
the business I work in,
'cause the other ones were too small.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.920
- Weren't they, the other tits?
- Well, no, they were fine.

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:39.471
Feel, it's really weird.
They don't feel like...

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.556
Leave the poor man alone, darling.

01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:42.632
-(chuckles)
- Sorry.

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:44.093
Next time, maybe.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:45.810
(laughs) Next time.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:47.896
I thought I was...
I thought I was very fair.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:50.975
You were. I was nice about you, too,
so we're even.

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.943
Well, I don't know,
I think I was more nice about you.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:55.946
- Goodnight, Lydia.
-(Lydia) Night, Mr Raymond.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:58.357
You want to get dinner or something?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.943
No, I think I'm just gonna go
and meet some friends

01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:02.614
and go and get dinner out.

01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.079
Give you a lift?

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:07.249
- No, I'm good. Thank you. Bye.
- Okay. All right, my love.

01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:08.834
That was very good.
That was very good.

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:11.662
- Well done. Bye, darling.
- Thank you, Pa. Love you. Bye.

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:14.915
Hello, Charles.

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:24.933
(inhaling deeply)

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:56.127
(Ainsley) Debbie arrived at my ﬂat.

01:28:56.206 --> 01:29:00.052
She drank some vodka,
and she snorted some cocaine.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:02.713
She then said
she wanted to try some heroin.

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:06.300
I'd never seen her do heroin
before that night.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:11.396
She snorted some heroin
and sat on the bed.

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:16.436
When I woke up, I tried to wake her
but she wouldn't wake up.

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:18.941
I thought she was joking.

01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:23.697
I tried to wake her by putting her under
the shower but she wouldn't wake up.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:31.079
I took her back to the bed and
gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:34.252
And then I called Mr Raymond.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:37.043
(Ainsley over phone) Hello. Mr Raymond?

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.879
-(Paul) Yes. Who's this?
- Look, I'm a friend of Debbie's.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:41.426
You need to come.

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.924
- Why, what's happened?
- She's here at my ﬂat.

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:46.765
J1 Anyone who ever loved

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.893
J1 Could look at me

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:53.518
J1 And know that I love you

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.225
J1 Anyone who ever dreamed

01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.561
J1 Could look at me

01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:04.404
J1 And know I dream of you...

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:05.825
(Paul) Hello?

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:09.033
Hello. Are you Ainsley?

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.907
Yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry.

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:16.745
J1 Anyone who had a heart
would take me in his arms

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:19.251
J1 And love me, too

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:20.423
(sobs)

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.047
J1 You couldn't really have a heart

01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:24.969
J1 That hurt me like you hurt me

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:29.512
J1 And be so untrue

01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:30.843
J1 What am I to do?

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:32.348
(sobbing) Debbie...

01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:34.471
J1 Every time you go away

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:37.015
"Where, O death, is your victory?

01:30:37.474 --> 01:30:39.693
"Where, O death, is your sting?"

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:42.984
For as much as it has
pleased Almighty God

01:30:43.146 --> 01:30:45.740
to take to himself the soul
of our beloved Debbie,

01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:49.486
we bear her body hence
to the place prepared for it.

01:30:49.611 --> 01:30:51.579
That ashes may return to ashes

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:53.453
and dust to dust.

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:57.286
(Edwyn) Who gives this woman
in marriage to this man?

01:30:57.911 --> 01:30:59.037
I do.

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:02.586
This is the first time
I've ever given anything away

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:05.544
and it's the thing
that is most precious to me.

01:31:06.002 --> 01:31:07.470
J1 Love me, too

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:10.219
J1 You couldn't really have a heart

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:13.893
J1 That hurt me like you hurt me

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:16.392
J1 And be so untrue

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:19.607
J1 What am I to do?

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:45.380
J1 Knowing I love you so

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.506
J1 Anyone who had a heart...

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.514
-(Paul) Hello, Jean.
- Hello.

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.054
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:31:58.138 --> 01:31:59.731
- Do you remember me?
- Yes.

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:01.604
Yeah? You've got big.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:05.236
- Oh, is that your baby sister?
- Yeah.

01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:08.573
Oh, yes, this is India.
This is her father, John.

01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:10.321
-(lndia coos)
- Hello.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.868
Hi, gorgeous.

01:32:14.904 --> 01:32:17.157
Well, don't spoil them
like you did Debbie.

01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:23.501
Nice to see you, Jean.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.174
You know, all she ever wanted
was to impress you.

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:27.626
To be strong like you.

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:29.757
To get everything she wanted,
just like you.

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:32.013
But she never was you.

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:34.804
(stutters) This is not the right time.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.301
No.

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:38.520
Never is with you.

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:40.305
Goodbye, Jean.

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:01.956
(Paul) Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:06.331
I'll take Fawn.
I'll see you later on, all right?

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:10.590
-31?
-(Paul) Yes.

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:13.387
-(Fawn) 32?
- Yes.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:15.928
-36?
- Yes.

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:18.889
Why do you buy
so many houses, Grandpa?

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:20.390
They're not houses,

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:24.191
they're offices, shops,
cafes, restaurants, clubs.

01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:26.063
But why so many?

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:28.444
I bought them for your mummy.

01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:30.739
For your mummy and you,
and your little sister.

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:33.992
- I don't want them.
- Why not?

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:36.486
I want my mummy.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.875
I know. I know.

01:33:43.034 --> 01:33:44.456
Now, this...

01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:46.170
this is my favourite.

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:48.498
- Do you own it?
- Yes, I do.

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:49.958
Do you fancy a cake?

01:33:50.083 --> 01:33:52.177
- Yes, please, Grandpa.
- Right.

01:33:52.377 --> 01:33:54.345
Charles, will you take Fawn inside?

01:33:58.424 --> 01:34:01.724
(Debbie singing)
J1 The look of love

01:34:02.846 --> 01:34:07.147
J1 Is in your eyes

01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:10.611
J1 The look your heart

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:14.399
J1 Can't disguise

01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:16.652
Can I have the berry cheesecake,

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:19.161
the strawberry mountain,

01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:21.740
the cake with the almonds around it

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:24.209
and the marzipan figs?

01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:26.374
I like this shop. Do you own it?

01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:29.005
No. No, not yet.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:32.258
Ah! So, what did you get?

01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:33.422
Chocolate éclair.

01:34:33.793 --> 01:34:36.216
- Thank you, Grandpa.
- You're welcome, Princess.

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:42.018
J1 I can hardly wait to hold you

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:45.097
J1 Feel my arms around you

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:47.558
J1 How long I have waited

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.984
J1 Waited just to love you

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:53.571
J1 Now that I have found you

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:55.774
J1 You've got the look

01:34:56.608 --> 01:34:58.781
J1 Of love

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:03.081
J1 It's on your face

01:35:03.489 --> 01:35:04.991
J1 The look

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:10.331
J1 That time can't erase

01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:17.130
J1 Be mine tonight

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:25.309
J1 Let this just be the start of
so many nights like this

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:34.606
J1 Let's take a lover's vow
and seal it with a kiss

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.941
J1 I can hardly wait to hold you

01:35:38.024 --> 01:35:40.493
J1 Feel my arms around you

01:35:41.194 --> 01:35:43.868
J1 How long I have waited

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:45.995
J1 Waited just to love you

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:48.623
J1 Now that I have found you

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:53.711
J1 Don't ever go

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:33.167
J1 I can hardly wait to hold you

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:36.959
J1 Feel my arms around you

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:39.760
J1 How long I have waited

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:42.130
J1 Waited just to love you

01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:44.716
J1 Now that I have found you

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:49.604
J1 Don't ever go

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:53.479
J1 Don't ever go

01:36:54.684 --> 01:36:57.688
J1 Don't ever go

01:36:59.939 --> 01:37:04.194
J1 I love you so J1

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.158
(applause)

01:37:13.369 --> 01:37:15.042
Thank you.
