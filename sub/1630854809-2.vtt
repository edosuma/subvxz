WEBVTT

00:07.703 --> 00:10.010
There'’s been a breach.
We'’ve gotta get everyone
out of the bay.

00:10.010 --> 00:14.057
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Susan, no!

00:14.057 --> 00:17.800
Susan, Susan.
No. No, no, no, no.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.107
- Trent!
- Please. I gotta try!
I gotta try.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.631
- No one told us
what happened to the ship.
- We don'’t know.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.763
We carry roughly
a four-week'’s supply onboard.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.635
We believe
the water recycling unit

00:26.635 --> 00:27.853
can be retrofitted
to work here,

00:27.853 --> 00:29.986
We just have to repurpose it.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.770
I demand to hear
from Captain Lester.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.468
- Where'’s the Captain?
- She'’s dead.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.078
We lost them all
in the incident.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.210
The three of us
standing before you

00:36.210 --> 00:37.428
are the highest ranking officers

00:37.428 --> 00:38.777
left on this ship.

00:38.777 --> 00:41.780
No one can find out about us.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.130
Automated voice:
<i>Oxygen depletion alert.</i>

00:43.130 --> 00:45.175
I need you.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.699
- Shh. You'’re wasting oxygen.
- I love you.

00:47.699 --> 00:50.833
I'’m so sorry.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.356
- I can'’t fix it.
- Why can'’t you fix it?

00:52.356 --> 00:54.141
Because I'’m not Jasper Dades.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.446
I'’ve been to a lot of places.

00:55.446 --> 00:56.969
Met a lot of people there.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.276
I believe her name was Denise.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.555
Don'’t go any closer.

01:17.555 --> 01:20.558
<i>Then how are we supposed
to investigate what hit us?</i>

01:20.558 --> 01:22.169
See what you can see
from there first,

01:22.169 --> 01:24.388
- then tether to the CETA spur.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

01:24.388 --> 01:26.651
<i>Moving to CETA spur position.
Lane, you take right.</i>

01:26.651 --> 01:28.000
<i>Scholnick, you take left.</i>

01:29.611 --> 01:30.742
Good RET.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.658
Good RET.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.051
RET good.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.753
Uh, there is nothing left
of any of these cryopod bays.

01:41.753 --> 01:44.669
Just twisted burnt mess.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.324
Any meteor chunks, ice,
or something like that?

01:47.324 --> 01:49.413
I know what to look for, Sharon.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.505
I'’m reading stress separation
on the wheel support trusses.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.597
- I don'’t see anything.
- Shit. I do.

01:59.597 --> 02:02.034
Guys, the starboard truss
is cracking. Detach now.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.688
Move, move!

02:06.038 --> 02:07.692
Get out of there, Lane.

02:20.444 --> 02:21.924
Lane!

02:25.754 --> 02:27.277
I'’ve got you, pal.
I'’ve got you.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.236
Scholnick, give me a hand.

02:29.236 --> 02:32.500
- Brice, status.
- Scholnick.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.111
<i>I'’ve lost
life readings on Scholnick.</i>

02:38.723 --> 02:40.116
Oh, my God.

02:42.466 --> 02:45.121
Damn it. How'’s Lane?

02:45.121 --> 02:46.818
I'’ve got him.
He'’s non-responsive.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.559
He'’s taken a nasty
conk to the head,

02:48.559 --> 02:50.257
<i>but his helmet seems
to have held integrity.</i>

02:50.257 --> 02:51.736
I'’ve got life signs on him.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.912
Pulse 45, pulse ox 84,

02:53.912 --> 02:55.653
but his BP is dangerously low.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.742
Get him to the airlock.
I'’ll meet you there.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.832
Dr. Kabir, meet me
at airlock 23, stat.

03:14.672 --> 03:17.414
- I broke my promise.
- What promise?

03:17.414 --> 03:19.590
I told Scholnick'’s wife
I'’d keep him safe.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.551
I'’m here for
my post-cryo physical

04:07.551 --> 04:09.553
like you asked, Dr. Kabir.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.816
Oh, my God.
Lieutenant Lane, are you okay?

04:11.816 --> 04:15.080
Oh, I'’m fine.
I'’d be even better if the doc
would just let me go.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.648
You'’re not fine.
You have a head wound
and a concussion.

04:17.648 --> 04:20.390
Ouch.
I had a concussion once,
when I was eight.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.783
Worst part was my mom had
to keep waking me up like--

04:21.783 --> 04:23.915
Uh, doc, I'’ve been waiting
three hours.

04:23.915 --> 04:27.136
Yeah, I'’m sorry.
I'’m a little backed up,
as you can see.

04:27.136 --> 04:30.095
Yeah, but people feel like
they'’ll pass out from the heat.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.880
Can we at least
get some air in here?

04:31.880 --> 04:33.577
Sorry, we had
to channel the energy

04:33.577 --> 04:35.579
from the climate control
to the bioshelter.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.799
Food takes priority
over comfort right now.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.192
- So you'’re the girl
who took over life support?
- Yeah, that'’s me.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.107
Why are you wasting
your time in here?

04:42.107 --> 04:44.196
You look pretty healthy to me.

04:44.196 --> 04:46.024
Well, I had an appointment
to get checked.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.809
Look around you, girl.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.246
Everyone'’s burning up,
starving, and dying of thirst.

04:50.246 --> 04:53.075
And you'’re over here
chatting up the doc?

04:53.075 --> 04:56.426
Well, I mean,
I can'’t magically produce
food or water we don'’t have.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.561
You know what people
are saying?

05:00.561 --> 05:04.042
People are saying
that you murdered that guy
who had a job before you

05:04.042 --> 05:07.089
- so you could get a better job.
- What?

05:07.089 --> 05:09.178
I mean, I don'’t even know
I'’d be considered for the job,

05:09.178 --> 05:11.485
- so that makes
absolutely no sense.
- Please wait over there.

05:15.271 --> 05:18.709
Can you believe that?
There are so many crazy rumors
flying around.

05:18.709 --> 05:22.670
- Yeah, I'’ve heard them all.
- I mean, nutso stuff.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.194
People were saying
that we were attacked,
which is crazy.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.415
We'’re the furthest out
anyone'’s ever been.
Who could attack us?

05:28.415 --> 05:30.330
It was obviously
some kind of meteor shower

05:30.330 --> 05:32.201
or some other
natural occurrence.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.811
And you know what else
people are saying?

05:33.811 --> 05:36.161
That it was some kind of
sabotage by the same person--

05:36.161 --> 05:37.989
Please shut up!

05:49.871 --> 05:51.655
- You okay, doc?
- I'’m sorry.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.353
I didn'’t mean
to lose my temper.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.749
All the other doctors
died in the event,

05:58.749 --> 06:02.492
and I'’m left to deal
with all these injured people

06:02.492 --> 06:04.189
and checking everyone for
post-hibernation problems--

06:04.189 --> 06:06.496
Have you rested at all?

06:06.496 --> 06:08.977
Since we came out
of hibernation, no.
How can I?

06:08.977 --> 06:11.501
How can you not?
You'’re only human.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.547
Look, lock all the doors,
don'’t let anyone in,

06:13.547 --> 06:15.331
and get some sleep.
That'’s an order.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.594
Now if you'’ll excuse me,
I have duties myself.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.988
Uh, you need to stay here
for observation.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.598
And you need
to get some sleep.

06:29.998 --> 06:33.741
Lane, how you doing?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.917
I'’ll live.
How'’s the ship?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.267
Yeah, I mean, only one
cross member was affected.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.617
There'’s five more
redundant struts,
so the structure'’s holding.

06:40.617 --> 06:43.925
So it'’s just bad luck
that it chose to give way
while we were out there?

06:43.925 --> 06:45.535
Yeah, particularly
bad luck for Scholnick.

06:48.146 --> 06:51.106
- He was a good guy.
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.412
You were at his wedding,
weren'’t you?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.370
It feels a lifetime ago.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.417
You know,
I actually introduced him
to his wife Kayley.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.767
After she dumped my ass.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.726
Of course you went out
with Scholnick'’s wife
before he even did.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.424
I bet you gave
quite the wedding speech.

07:04.424 --> 07:09.167
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I was not allowed
to make a speech.

07:09.167 --> 07:13.171
You know,
I do wonder if any of them
are still alive back home.

07:13.171 --> 07:17.480
Hey, let'’s just focus on
the people here on this ship.

07:17.480 --> 07:21.179
They'’re asking
even more questions
after Scholnick'’s death.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.791
Rumor mill'’s going crazy.
Was it sabotage?

07:23.791 --> 07:25.706
Did the same person
who killed Jasper
sabotage the ship?

07:25.706 --> 07:27.925
We'’ve gotta
tell them something.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.753
Yeah, well,
unfortunately right now
all we can tell them

07:29.753 --> 07:32.495
is we just don'’t know.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.987
- Whoa there!
- Sorry. I didn'’t mean to.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.250
Hey, you'’re the girl
who took over life support.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.818
Yes, but I can'’t do anything
about the water or the--

07:50.818 --> 07:53.995
Hey, no,
they gave me your old job.

07:53.995 --> 07:56.606
Waste management,
so thanks for that.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.956
Sorry. I didn'’t mean
to saddle you with it.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.871
No, no. Hey!

08:00.871 --> 08:04.092
I mean it. Thanks.
I needed a job.

08:04.092 --> 08:08.531
I used to work the cryopod bay,
so that job'’s kind of gone.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.924
And, look,
I wanna contribute somehow,
you know?

08:09.924 --> 08:13.057
Even if it means
dealing with people'’s shit.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.364
You know you'’re supposed
to take the fecal matter
to Angus, right?

08:15.364 --> 08:17.627
He uses it as fertilizer.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.629
You'’re also responsible for
the gray water and the urine.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.936
Yes, yes, of course.
I don'’t want to
forget the urine.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.634
Hey, urine'’s important.
It'’s 95% water.

08:24.634 --> 08:28.638
- Do you know that?
- No, I did not know that.
I have so much to learn.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.597
Well, the other 5% is sodium,

08:30.597 --> 08:33.034
potassium, creatinine,
and chloride.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.862
The only part
we throw away is the urea.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.386
Sorry.
Too much information.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.431
No, no, no. It'’s okay.
You know a lot.

08:39.431 --> 08:40.824
I mean,
where are you from anyway?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.260
The great island
of human waste?

08:42.260 --> 08:44.262
Cincinnati by way of London,

08:44.262 --> 08:46.264
by way of New Africa,
by way of Amsterdam.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.614
That'’s why people can
never figure out my accent,

08:47.614 --> 08:50.442
which is... oh.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.967
- You were joking.
- Yep.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.535
Sorry, I have a tendency
to be very literal.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.277
It'’s okay. It's okay.

08:59.277 --> 09:02.803
Anyway,
I'’d happy to show you
around down there.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.282
It'’s really fascinating
once you get into it.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.589
I can'’t ever see
getting into it like you.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.983
But, hey, who knows?

09:08.983 --> 09:12.508
You seem really into it,
so maybe that'’ll rub off on me.

09:12.508 --> 09:16.164
I'’ll do my best
to rub off on you.

09:16.164 --> 09:19.907
I mean, um, I have to go...

09:26.174 --> 09:28.089
"I'’ll do my best
to rub off on you"?

09:28.089 --> 09:29.046
What does that even mean?

09:33.398 --> 09:38.665
As we release these souls
to their final resting places,

09:38.665 --> 09:41.929
into the peaceful calm of space,

09:41.929 --> 09:46.150
let anyone who wishes to remain
and bear witness do so.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.501
Everyone else, feel free
to pay your last respects

09:49.501 --> 09:51.199
and go about your business.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.429
Harris!

10:34.329 --> 10:35.460
Stop! Stop!

10:37.506 --> 10:40.683
Dumping human remains in space
is a waste of valuable resources

10:40.683 --> 10:43.381
- when we could put them
in the NOR drum.
- That'’s genius.

10:43.381 --> 10:47.385
- You wanna compost
the remains in the NOR.
- Uh, sorry, NOR?

10:47.385 --> 10:49.605
Natural Organic Reduction drum.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.868
It'’s an accelerated
composting mechanism.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.175
We have one onboard
to use on the planet
when we get there,

10:54.175 --> 10:57.178
but I took it out of storage
and fired it up to compost

10:57.178 --> 10:59.180
- what little waste we have.
- Of course you did.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.921
Personally,
I think cannibalism
is sacrilege.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.531
Cannibalism?
Who'’s talking
about cannibalism?

11:02.531 --> 11:04.228
We'’d be making food
for the plants.

11:04.228 --> 11:07.057
- Which we would then eat.
- Yeah, I'’m with Mr. Strickland.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.363
Even thinking about this
makes me feel sick.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.799
Eject the bodies into space.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.627
- That'’s an order.
- That'’s a huge mistake.

11:11.627 --> 11:14.412
The laws of conservation state
we need use everything

11:14.412 --> 11:16.676
- at our disposal to survive.
- Why is she here?

11:16.676 --> 11:21.028
She'’s on the council
since Brice put her in charge
of life support.

11:21.028 --> 11:24.248
- Why did you do that?
- Because she'’s really
frigging smart.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.642
- Thank you.
- I already gave an order.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.644
What happened to not taking
unilateral action?

11:28.644 --> 11:31.081
Isn'’t that what
you accused me of?

11:31.081 --> 11:34.781
Shouldn'’t we think about what
people who died would want?

11:34.781 --> 11:36.652
Harris worked in my department,

11:36.652 --> 11:39.437
and I think he would want
to continue to contribute

11:39.437 --> 11:41.526
to the mission'’s success.

11:41.526 --> 11:46.618
- Isn'’t this a way
for him to do so?
- Okay, we'’ll vote.

11:46.618 --> 11:50.405
- I already gave an order.
- All of in favor
of Angus'’s plan,

11:50.405 --> 11:51.319
raise your hand.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.194
Opposed?

11:57.194 --> 11:59.675
Okay, that decides that.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.938
Take the remains
to Angus'’ machine.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.641
You had no right
to override me.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.165
I didn'’t. I called a vote.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.732
Now we have bigger fish to fry.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.385
Oh, man, what I wouldn'’t give

12:14.385 --> 12:17.258
for an actual fish to fry
right about now.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.651
We need to get the engines
back up to near light speed

12:19.651 --> 12:21.828
or we won'’t reach Prox B

12:21.828 --> 12:23.264
before a one-year journey
turns to ten.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.048
Plus,
there'’s a murderer onboard,

12:25.048 --> 12:26.833
and we still have no idea
what hit us.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.835
People seemed particularly
freaked out by that last one.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.054
Well, then maybe you should
go back to figuring that out

12:31.054 --> 12:32.490
instead of just
sitting here complaining

12:32.490 --> 12:34.710
- about who'’s in charge.
- Go to hell.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.758
Good. That went well.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.943
- Spence! Spence, hold on.
- What?

12:49.943 --> 12:52.075
Look, Lane, I know
you don'’t like Garnet

12:52.075 --> 12:53.685
telling you what to do, right?

12:53.685 --> 12:55.296
But she'’s not wrong.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.906
We need to find out
what hit us.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.299
I mean, you said yourself,
people are coming up

12:58.299 --> 13:01.650
with all kinds of
crazy explanations.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.565
Are you not all
suspicious of Garnet?

13:05.306 --> 13:07.090
What do you mean?

13:07.090 --> 13:09.397
Do we even know who she is?

13:09.397 --> 13:12.139
She didn'’t train
with the rest of us.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.968
None of us had even
heard of her until
we stepped foot on this ship.

13:18.623 --> 13:22.323
<i>So I'’m very proud
to be the commanding officer
of the first ark.</i>

13:22.323 --> 13:24.891
Now I'’d like to
introduce to you the person

13:24.891 --> 13:27.284
you civilians
will be interfacing with,

13:27.284 --> 13:29.504
Lieutenant Commander
Susan Ingram.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.815
While we are on this ship,
you will be under

13:35.815 --> 13:39.079
Global Space Administration jurisdiction.

13:39.079 --> 13:44.127
Of course, we will
only be conscious for a week
before we go into cryo.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.129
But in that time,
I look forward

13:46.129 --> 13:48.697
to getting to know each
and every one of you.

13:48.697 --> 13:53.180
And now, I am truly excited
to patch us in

13:53.180 --> 13:57.793
with the man who designed
this wonderful spacecraft.

13:57.793 --> 14:01.666
In fact, he designed
the entire Ark Program.

14:01.666 --> 14:05.018
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. William Trust.

14:07.194 --> 14:10.327
Hello, I'’m William Trust.

14:10.327 --> 14:13.591
I wish I could be there
with you in person for this
historic moment,

14:13.591 --> 14:16.246
but, alas, I'’m busy
preparing the other arks

14:16.246 --> 14:17.726
for their future journeys.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.684
We hope to send
as many as 20 arks

14:19.684 --> 14:22.296
just like this one,
full of people...

14:22.296 --> 14:25.821
I thought Trust got fired
from his own company
because he went crazy.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.084
Most geniuses
are a little crazy.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.956
My life'’s work
has always been about

14:29.956 --> 14:31.609
making life better
for mankind.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.395
If it weren'’t for him,
none of us would be here.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.571
I guess.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.399
But he went
from genius savior of mankind

14:38.399 --> 14:41.184
to a guy with a god complex.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.925
He shouldn'’t be speaking
for the mission anymore.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.188
...between the GSA
and Trust Industries,

14:45.188 --> 14:46.624
you get to be the first to go

14:46.624 --> 14:49.801
on the biggest adventure
in human history.

14:49.801 --> 14:53.457
And in doing so,
you may just find us a new home.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.904
That will be all.
Prepare for departure.

15:13.042 --> 15:16.741
I am so excited
for this wonderful adventure,

15:16.741 --> 15:20.441
and I promise you all
I will continue to dutifully
record my Catgrams

15:20.441 --> 15:22.225
as I'’ve always done on Earth

15:22.225 --> 15:24.445
right up until
we go into stasis.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.708
They tell me
after five years of cryo,

15:26.708 --> 15:29.450
I won'’t have aged a day.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.018
How wonderful is that?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.454
Now, if you'’ll excuse me,

15:33.454 --> 15:35.717
I'’ll see you on your holos
and screens...

15:39.068 --> 15:41.375
...assuming there'’s
anyone left alive on Earth
to receive them.

15:44.421 --> 15:48.730
- It'’s Lane, yeah.
This is Trent and--
- Trent.

15:48.730 --> 15:52.473
At ease. Gentlemen,
I'’d like you to meet

15:52.473 --> 15:53.822
the new addition
to your cohort.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.694
This is
Lieutenant Sharon Garnet.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.479
So happy to meet you, gentlemen.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.350
I hope you will introduce me
around once we get underway.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.961
Of course.
Looking forward to it.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.180
Let me introduce you to
some of the other officers.

16:07.444 --> 16:10.839
Susan.
You know anything about this?

16:10.839 --> 16:14.103
- What do you mean?
- Well, Lieutenant Garnet.

16:14.103 --> 16:18.542
She just arrived today,
didn'’t train with any of us.
What'’s her story?

16:18.542 --> 16:23.765
All I know is she was
assigned here last minute
by someone high up.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.512
Okay, you do have a point.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.949
I do kind of wonder
who put her on the ship.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.302
- What are you doing?
- I'’m just gonna
have a lie down.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.304
This is my quarters.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.873
- There are only
two officers quarters.
- Why?

16:44.873 --> 16:48.094
Well, because we weren'’t
meant to come out of cryo
until we reached Prox B.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.009
The sleep quarters
are for the skeleton crew

16:50.009 --> 16:51.532
left onboard after
we go to the surface.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.751
- Only two officers.
- Oh, I know, I know.

16:53.751 --> 16:58.539
I know all that.
I mean, why do you
get this one?

16:58.539 --> 17:00.323
Because Garnet took
the captain'’s quarters,

17:00.323 --> 17:03.109
- so I should get this one.
- Oh. Why exactly?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.371
Because--

17:07.809 --> 17:09.941
Good question.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.379
I mean, why does she
get the captain'’s quarters?

17:12.379 --> 17:15.382
Because she'’s
quite clearly taken
the role of acting Captain

17:15.382 --> 17:17.253
despite your protests.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.257
How about this?

17:21.257 --> 17:23.346
At the next council meeting,
the three of us will draw straws

17:23.346 --> 17:24.608
to see who gets the rooms.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.177
Yeah, good luck with that.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.192
What the...

17:44.802 --> 17:45.803
What are you doing?

17:48.545 --> 17:50.373
You startled me.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.114
I was just checking
the entrance logs

17:52.114 --> 17:55.204
to see who came in here last,
but they'’ve been wiped.

17:55.204 --> 17:59.121
- I wonder who
could'’ve done that.
- Are you accusing me?

17:59.121 --> 18:01.036
Everyone'’s a suspect
until they'’re not,

18:01.036 --> 18:02.820
which is why you shouldn'’t be
poking your nose around in here.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.779
Come on, Felix.
You know I didn'’t
murder this guy.

18:04.779 --> 18:05.910
Do I?

18:09.262 --> 18:11.829
- I didn'’t murder Jasper Dades.
- His name was Malcolm Perry.

18:11.829 --> 18:14.049
Whatever his name was,
I had no reason to kill him.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.268
Just the same,
this is my investigation.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.096
I suggest you stay out of it.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.145
You'’re right. I apologize.

18:23.145 --> 18:26.279
- I will steer clear.
- Thank you.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.672
But let me know
if you need any help
with anything, Felix.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.718
You can start by telling me
who has clearance high enough

18:30.718 --> 18:32.589
to wipe the logs
on a security pad.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.334
Anyone with 1C clearance.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.641
And who has 1C clearance,
Sharon?

18:40.641 --> 18:45.298
Eva Markovic, Lieutenant Lane,
Lieutenant Brice, and me.

19:24.772 --> 19:25.773
Oh!

19:27.470 --> 19:29.211
No. No!

19:38.177 --> 19:40.135
It took me too long to find
a shutoff valve to stop it.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.268
- We lost a lot of water.
- How much did we lose?

19:42.268 --> 19:45.009
Uh, I don'’t know.
My guess would be
more than 100 gallons.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.968
100 gallons?
That was our drinking water.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.578
I'’m sorry. It's my fault.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.711
If I hadn'’t insisted on
the stupid bioshelter garden--

19:50.711 --> 19:53.801
We wouldn'’t have
any water or food.

19:53.801 --> 19:56.978
You couldn'’t have
anticipated any of this.

19:56.978 --> 20:00.155
Okay, can we recover
any of the spilt water?

20:00.155 --> 20:02.505
Uh, maybe some of it,
if Eva can get

20:02.505 --> 20:04.159
the water reclamation
unit working again.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.508
Did you ask her
how long that would take?

20:05.508 --> 20:06.901
Well, I couldn'’t
find her to ask.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.946
Wait, you couldn'’t find her?

20:08.946 --> 20:11.906
Garnet to Eva Markovic.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.517
Markovic?

20:14.517 --> 20:15.605
Where the hell is she?

20:16.780 --> 20:18.782
Eva?

20:20.393 --> 20:21.785
Eva Markovic?

20:24.440 --> 20:26.964
Eva, there'’s been
a water spill,

20:26.964 --> 20:31.708
and we need your expertise.
Oh, boy.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.710
Are you okay?

20:37.975 --> 20:41.588
Dr. Brandice, I could use
a little help here.

20:41.588 --> 20:46.593
Me? Oh, um, I'’m not sure
I'’ll be any help.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.335
Try.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.604
What'’s wrong?

20:57.604 --> 21:00.215
I think there was something
between her and that man

21:00.215 --> 21:03.262
from her department who died
in the oxygen crisis.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.220
I think his name was Harris.

21:05.220 --> 21:08.876
Oh, Harris, yes.
I met him on intake.

21:08.876 --> 21:13.054
He seemed like
a wonderful guy.
Handsome, too.

21:14.664 --> 21:18.494
Uh, where did you meet him?

21:18.494 --> 21:20.409
Come on.
Don'’t you want to tell me
about your man?

21:27.068 --> 21:31.420
Must'’ve been hard to have
cared so much for a man
and have to keep it secret.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.858
It must be even more
difficult to lose someone
so special to you

21:34.858 --> 21:37.948
and to keep your grief
bottled up inside because
you don'’t wanna get in trouble.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.996
Oh, you want me to--

21:44.738 --> 21:49.133
Eva, no one is gonna
give you a hard time
about that relationship.

21:49.133 --> 21:53.355
- No.
- At this point we'’re all
just trying to survive.

21:53.355 --> 21:56.619
As far as I'’m concerned,
that rule never existed,

21:56.619 --> 21:59.492
and it'’s stupid
that it even did exist.

22:01.189 --> 22:04.148
- Kalemegdan Park.
- Pardon!

22:04.148 --> 22:10.154
That'’s where I met Harris.
Kalemegdan Park in Belgrade.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.896
We both used to go there
to feed the birds.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.943
- Before the birds were gone.
- I'’ve been there.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.947
Yeah. Beautiful park.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.645
What a romantic place to meet.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.300
Was Harris a romantic?

22:25.300 --> 22:28.651
- Yeah, he was sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.480
So here'’s what
I want you to do, Eva.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.483
I want you to only think of
the good times with Harris.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.224
Don'’t let your mind drift
to anything sad.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.226
Do you think you can do that?

22:38.226 --> 22:40.315
And we need you to work on
the water reclam--

22:40.315 --> 22:43.274
Take some time
with those happy memories.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.711
Get a hold of yourself enough

22:44.711 --> 22:47.714
to do what the lieutenant here
wants you to do.

22:47.714 --> 22:51.108
And then after you do it,
come tell me all
the happy stories

22:51.108 --> 22:53.284
you can think of
with that handsome man.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.165
There. Rewind a bit.

23:05.906 --> 23:10.171
Yeah, that must be
where it hit us.

23:10.171 --> 23:12.347
But the camera wasn'’t damaged.
It'’s still working out there.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.436
There has to be a way
to see what it saw.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.090
My best guess
is that whatever did this

23:16.090 --> 23:18.309
triggered an EM pulse
which shut down the cameras.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.442
Because look.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.967
They came back online
sometime after the hit.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.317
If that'’s the case,
there'’s no way
to recover the video

23:26.317 --> 23:29.103
- because it never recorded.
- Any progress?

23:29.103 --> 23:31.540
- Afraid not.
- Lieutenant Lane,

23:31.540 --> 23:33.499
do you mind if we ask you
some questions?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.849
About what?

23:35.849 --> 23:39.592
Where were you
at 1600 ship time
the day of the murder?

23:39.592 --> 23:42.203
- Why?
- That'’s when that imposter
was murdered.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.292
What? And you think
one of us did it?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.860
Lieutenant Brice
was with me at that time.
I cannot rule you out.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.166
Me and about 150
other people on this ship.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.560
The entry log
in the keypad to the room
where he was killed

23:51.560 --> 23:54.041
would have told me
who entered the room,
but the log was wiped.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.957
- And?
- And you'’re one
of only four people

23:56.957 --> 23:59.176
who had access codes
high enough to wipe
the information.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.309
So where were you
at that time?

24:04.181 --> 24:07.402
I don'’t have to answer
any of your questions.

24:07.402 --> 24:11.232
- I outrank you.
- I'’m not in the GSA.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.016
You have no rank over me.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.197
Uh, just for future reference,

24:20.197 --> 24:22.417
Lane'’s not really the type
to find the whole

24:22.417 --> 24:26.377
"You'’re not the boss of me"
argument particularly endearing.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.126
You have to
stop blaming yourself.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.999
I mean, you couldn'’t
have anticipated a water
coupling would blow.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.567
- Did you build it?
- One of Eva'’s techs did.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.221
Then if anything,
it'’s his fault.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.354
It doesn'’t much matter
whose fault it is.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.182
We'’re gonna run out of water
in about three days,

24:48.182 --> 24:49.836
and die of thirst
in about a week.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.538
What the heck
kind of knife is this?

24:59.193 --> 25:01.064
That'’s a hunting knife.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.284
My dad used to hunt
when there was still game
to hunt back home.

25:03.284 --> 25:06.026
That blade is made to kill
and skin an animal.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.202
- Why do you have it?
- It'’s not mine.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.511
It must have
come out of the pipe.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.251
Which means someone
must have dumped it

25:14.251 --> 25:16.515
in one of the water tanks
where they have hatch access.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.429
Then it flowed through
the water,

25:18.429 --> 25:20.780
got lodged there,
and bam.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.433
Oh, my gosh.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.261
You don'’t think--

25:24.261 --> 25:26.394
you don'’t think this
is the murder weapon?

25:43.498 --> 25:45.892
We have to get this
water reclamation unit working.

25:45.892 --> 25:49.069
Stark, check the pressure
on valve 42J.

25:49.069 --> 25:52.115
Novak, report on intake
two and four.

25:59.862 --> 26:04.345
- You okay, boss?
- No. Not really.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.657
Eva, I know
about you and Harris.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.050
I'’m not blind.
None of us are.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.096
And we will all understand
if you take some time--

26:16.096 --> 26:18.925
I don'’t have time to take.

26:18.925 --> 26:21.318
If we don'’t get
this thing up and running,
we all die of thirst.

26:21.318 --> 26:25.845
Eva, you need to grieve.
I can handle this.

26:25.845 --> 26:29.805
Can you? So why is it
not up and running already?

26:29.805 --> 26:31.851
Well, we'’re working on it.

26:31.851 --> 26:35.332
I appreciate your concern,
Sasha. I do.

26:35.332 --> 26:38.031
But you'’re not qualified
to fix it.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.685
Neither are you.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.122
Everyone who was
qualified is dead.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.906
I'’m next in line.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.343
And no offense,
but I'’m the most up to date

26:46.343 --> 26:48.128
to this ship'’s engineering.

26:48.128 --> 26:51.305
So help or get out of way.

27:04.318 --> 27:07.582
Garnet. A word.

27:07.582 --> 27:09.584
Just make sure you'’re
on top of that.

27:09.584 --> 27:13.153
What'’s up?

27:13.153 --> 27:15.982
Just keeping you apprised.
I'’m doing another EVA.

27:15.982 --> 27:18.158
- What? Why?
- To figure out
what the hell hit us.

27:18.158 --> 27:21.552
- Why else?
- A man died last time,

27:21.552 --> 27:23.380
and you'’re lucky you even
made it back alive.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.643
- It'’s too dangerous.
- What?

27:24.643 --> 27:26.557
Look, we need to know
what hit us.

27:26.557 --> 27:29.082
Send someone else.
You'’re too important.
You'’re our only navigator.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.737
- Fine, I'’ll go.
- You already have a concussion.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.652
- Send Leighton.
- What? No. No, no, no.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.219
I'’m not sending
someone else to do something
I wouldn'’t do myself.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.700
I'’m not dragging anyone
with me and risk having
another person lost.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.834
But you'’re fine with it
being you who'’s lost.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.796
- Please don'’t do this.
- Is that an order?

27:47.796 --> 27:50.669
Call it whatever you want.
Just don'’t do it.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.237
- Give me your word.
- Fine.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.509
- You'’re doing it, right?
- Oh, yeah.
Soon as shift changes.

28:14.344 --> 28:15.650
Mind?

28:19.915 --> 28:22.265
So was that knife I found
the murder weapon?

28:26.443 --> 28:29.403
Could you get
fingerprints off it? DNA?

28:31.448 --> 28:35.191
It'’s not like we have
a crime lab on board.

28:35.191 --> 28:38.673
Right, sorry.
Of course not.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.371
- But, yes,
it is the murder weapon.
- How do you know?

28:41.371 --> 28:46.637
Hook blade matches
the shape of the wound
on the victim'’s throat.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.596
I checked the manifest.
There are no knives

28:48.596 --> 28:51.207
with this blade shape that
are supposed to be onboard.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.209
So someone smuggled it on?

28:53.209 --> 28:55.864
- Doesn'’t that mean
it was premeditated?
- I don'’t know.

29:04.046 --> 29:07.833
- Why should you get
any water, huh?
- Because I'’m thirsty.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.792
It'’s your fault
we lost most of it.
You and your stupid farm.

29:10.792 --> 29:14.840
- Please. Give it back.
- Give it back.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.146
- Make me.
- If you insist.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.383
Break it up!

29:53.139 --> 29:55.881
Thanks.

30:27.173 --> 30:29.610
I say we lock them all up
before they cause more trouble.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.960
Are you going to
lock me up, too?
I threw the second punch.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.180
Where would we put them anyways?
We don'’t have a brig.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.052
The only prisoner we ever had,
we locked in a storage closet.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.706
Which didn'’t go
so well for him.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.622
Besides, this is an
all hands on deck situation.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.580
We need everyone
doing their jobs.

30:43.580 --> 30:46.366
We can'’t risk them
making trouble.
It would be chaos.

30:46.366 --> 30:50.152
Look, we'’re all on edge,
sleep deprived,
hungry, thirsty.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.502
This kind of behavior
is only a symptom.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.374
We need to address the cause.

30:54.374 --> 30:57.420
And how do you suggest
we do that?

31:15.177 --> 31:19.660
There you are.
Glad to see one of us
getting some rest.

31:19.660 --> 31:23.098
Yes. Sleep is so important.

31:23.098 --> 31:27.059
Skin tone, hair shininess,
whiter eyes.

31:27.059 --> 31:30.845
- You should get some sleep.
- Will it help me save this
ship and everybody on it?

31:30.845 --> 31:32.629
Feeling a little
self-important are we?

31:32.629 --> 31:36.198
- Dr. Brandice--
- It'’s Cat to my friends.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.592
I get the feeling
you need a friend.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.028
I don'’t know
if you'’ve noticed,

31:40.028 --> 31:44.032
but the crew is starting
to lose it on this ship.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.991
We just had a near riot
in the mess hall.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.644
People have been fighting
all over this ship,

31:47.644 --> 31:49.603
and you'’re in here
getting your beauty rest?

31:49.603 --> 31:51.866
What should I be doing?

31:51.866 --> 31:54.434
I'’m officially naming you
head of ship wide
mental health.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.871
You can start having sessions
with anyone who needs.

31:58.046 --> 32:01.006
Whoa. Oh, uh, hold on.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.572
Um, I'’m flattered,

32:02.572 --> 32:05.010
but I'’m certainly
not qualified for that.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.490
I'’m on board
to be the celebrity face
of the mission.

32:07.490 --> 32:11.277
In case you missed it,
this ship isn'’t exactly
camera ready.

32:11.277 --> 32:14.671
- I need you in a new role.
- Look, I was a TV
relationship specialist.

32:14.671 --> 32:17.674
I talked about sex
and who'’s doing who
and how often.

32:17.674 --> 32:18.980
And you'’ve published
how many books?

32:18.980 --> 32:21.940
Self-help books.
You could write those.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.464
A five-year-old could.
I'’m not qualified.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.683
I wouldn'’t even
know where to start.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.120
I saw you talk Eva
off a ledge.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.383
- You'’re good. Yes.
- That?

32:30.383 --> 32:32.124
I was winging it. I lied.

32:32.124 --> 32:35.562
No idea who her boyfriend was.
Never been to that park.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.911
Well, keep winging it.
You'’re good at it.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.088
And if I refuse?

32:42.699 --> 32:46.094
Look, we both know
the real reason
you'’re on this ship

32:46.094 --> 32:47.704
is because you knew
people in high places.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.185
Well, the highest placed
person you know now is me,

32:50.185 --> 32:52.492
and I'’m telling you
you'’re gonna carry
your weight around here

32:52.492 --> 32:53.667
one way or another.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.930
I could reassign you
to a position

32:55.930 --> 32:57.497
in waste management
if you'’d prefer.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.717
Gross.

33:00.717 --> 33:03.938
Fine. I'’ll do it.

33:03.938 --> 33:05.940
And from what I'’m seeing here,
you'’ll be my first patient.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.507
Oh, you have no idea.

33:10.901 --> 33:15.080
But if I'’m going to do this,

33:15.080 --> 33:17.169
there are a few things
I'’ll need.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.873
Keep an eye
on that support structure.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.657
<i>I'’m not worried about it.</i>

33:27.657 --> 33:29.311
<i>The only damaged part
is already broke off.</i>

33:29.311 --> 33:30.747
Just keep an eye on it anyway.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.184
I'’m monitoring
stress stability here.

33:32.184 --> 33:35.100
<i>So far, it all looks fine.</i>

33:43.325 --> 33:46.589
All right, target reached.

33:48.765 --> 33:51.377
You know, this doesn'’t look
like an impact pattern.

33:53.335 --> 33:56.947
Most of the steel is melted,
like it touched the sun.

33:56.947 --> 34:01.126
<i>There'’s some kind of crystal
thing wedged in there.</i>

34:01.126 --> 34:03.084
I see a few of them.
They look like diamonds.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.186
What the hell?

34:20.145 --> 34:21.450
Aye, they look like diamonds.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.628
<i>Checking compressive strength.</i>

34:29.371 --> 34:30.416
Oh, that can'’t be good.

34:33.854 --> 34:36.596
- Get back to the airlock.
<i>- It'’s melting my glove.</i>

34:36.596 --> 34:38.467
Get back here now before
it breaches your EMU.

34:38.467 --> 34:41.296
Lane, the glove'’s fingers
are nearly off!

34:41.296 --> 34:43.951
Brice, cinch the wrist,
keep the rest of the EMU sealed.

34:43.951 --> 34:47.172
- Your skin will freeze.
- I'’m coming in hot!

34:58.444 --> 35:00.620
Seal the wrist!
I'’m pressurizing now.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.582
Oh, no!

35:06.582 --> 35:08.106
Don'’t-- don't get too close!

35:10.412 --> 35:11.892
Damn it!

35:14.764 --> 35:15.896
I hate it when Garnet'’s right.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.948
You'’ve got
substantial frostbite

35:24.948 --> 35:27.647
and you'’ve lost most
of the first three
layers of dermis.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.301
But it should grow back
good as new.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.041
You sure none of that stuff
is still on me?

35:31.041 --> 35:33.479
- No sign of it.
- Any idea what could'’ve
caused this, doc?

35:33.479 --> 35:36.830
- Some kind of acid?
- No clue. I haven'’t seen
anything like that.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.659
Whatever it was,
it must not react
with human skin,

35:39.659 --> 35:42.401
or I imagine Lieutenant Brice
wouldn'’t have any left.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.403
You gave me your word
you wouldn'’t perform an EVA.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.318
- I lied.
- We were just trying
to give the crew

35:46.318 --> 35:47.623
some of the answers
they deserved.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.234
And did you get
any answers for them?

35:49.234 --> 35:50.278
Well, unfortunately not yet.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.150
But you know what you did do?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.500
You showed them
just how out of control
their leadership is.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.197
If we can'’t respect each other,
trust each other,

35:56.197 --> 35:57.938
if we can'’t work together...

36:00.941 --> 36:02.203
...then why should they trust us

36:02.203 --> 36:04.466
to make sure
they survive out here?

36:04.466 --> 36:06.468
Now, I don'’t know about you,

36:06.468 --> 36:08.209
but I'’m going on 52 hours
without sleep.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.472
- Same.
- Aye, me, too.

36:10.472 --> 36:12.605
Only 52? Must be nice.

36:12.605 --> 36:16.565
Lack of sleep
is probably contributing
to our bad attitudes.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.480
I suggest we get some rest.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.265
Well, I won'’t
fight you on that.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.744
You should give one of
the shifts a sleep break too.

36:21.744 --> 36:25.357
Attention, all hands.

36:25.357 --> 36:27.010
This is Lieutenant Garnet
speaking for Lieutenant Lane

36:27.010 --> 36:29.709
and Lieutenant Brice as well.

36:29.709 --> 36:34.279
We just wanted to say
how proud we are of this crew

36:34.279 --> 36:36.106
and how hard
you have all worked.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.934
Things are stabilized for now,

36:37.934 --> 36:40.546
so, crew shifts one and two,
take leave,

36:40.546 --> 36:43.984
get five hours of rest,
and then we will trade shifts.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.642
We'’ll convene in the ready room
in five hours.

36:49.642 --> 36:50.556
That okay with everyone?

36:55.735 --> 36:58.564
I can'’t.
I have patients.

36:58.564 --> 37:02.872
- Some of us are shift one.
- Keep working.

37:02.872 --> 37:05.745
We'’re all hot
and exhausted and thirsty.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.052
You'’ll be a lot more thirsty

37:09.052 --> 37:10.750
if we don'’t get
the system working

37:10.750 --> 37:12.665
to reclaim some
of the lost water

37:12.665 --> 37:14.580
from the floors
in the bioshelter,

37:14.580 --> 37:17.452
toilet water, gray water,
and make it all drinkable.

37:17.452 --> 37:20.542
If we get it up to
90% of capacity,

37:20.542 --> 37:22.501
it buys us at least
a few weeks,

37:22.501 --> 37:23.763
which beats the hell out of

37:23.763 --> 37:26.374
running out of water
in two days.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.902
Yeah, okay. You'’re right.

37:32.902 --> 37:37.037
Good.
Now release the pressure
on valve 2A.

37:41.607 --> 37:45.219
Since you'’re wounded,
I'’ll let you take the bed.
I'’ll take the floor.

37:45.219 --> 37:48.614
- Ah, you'’re the one
with the head injury.
- Just take the damn bed.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.964
Oh, you are a gentleman
and a scholar, my friend.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.668
Are you two handsome men here
for a session?

37:59.668 --> 38:03.716
- We'’re here to
grab some shut eye.
- What are you doing here?

38:03.716 --> 38:05.500
Well, if you'’re not here
for a session,

38:05.500 --> 38:09.330
then I'’m sorry,
but you'’ll have to go.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.202
- Who told you
you could move in here?
- Commander Garnet.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.639
- Of course.
- It'’s Lieutenant Garnet.

38:13.639 --> 38:14.814
She asked me to conduct
therapy sessions

38:14.814 --> 38:16.555
with the crew, and I told her

38:16.555 --> 38:18.600
I would need a private room
in which to do so.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.385
Well,
she didn'’t have the authority
to give you this room.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.951
Well, nonetheless, I'’m here.

38:21.951 --> 38:24.258
So if you wish
to spend time in this room,

38:24.258 --> 38:27.087
I suggest you make
an appointment for a session.

38:27.087 --> 38:30.046
I'’ll take you two separately
or both at once.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.179
I bet you will.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.718
Hey, hey.

38:49.718 --> 38:54.288
Do you mind, James?
They only gave me
five hours to sleep.

38:54.288 --> 38:57.987
I'’m sorry, Jelena.
Could you maybe move over
and share your bunk?

38:57.987 --> 39:01.164
- I won'’t take much room.
- No funny business?

39:01.164 --> 39:04.254
No. No, no, no, no, no.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.561
Look, I just--
I really need to sleep.

39:21.271 --> 39:23.273
You can have mine, Lieutenant.

39:23.273 --> 39:24.884
Oh, no. That'’s okay.
You need sleep, too.

39:24.884 --> 39:28.148
No, it'’s no problem.
I'’ll sleep in the bioshelter.

39:28.148 --> 39:29.497
Huh.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.153
Thanks, kid.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.302
- How'’s the pressure?
- Eight PSI.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.392
- A little low, but in range.
- Let'’s crank it up.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.442
Fingers crossed.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.100
30 PSI. 35.

40:07.100 --> 40:10.233
37 and holding.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.193
Can we get it up any more?

40:15.325 --> 40:17.284
I don'’t think so.

40:42.178 --> 40:44.180
I wish you would'’ve
taken the cryopod

40:44.180 --> 40:46.792
next to mine like I asked.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.968
'’Cause right about now
I could really use some council

40:48.968 --> 40:51.579
from someone
who understands my situation.

41:01.415 --> 41:04.766
<i>Central council
to Cent-Com, please,</i>

41:04.766 --> 41:06.072
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

41:08.204 --> 41:11.120
- How'’s your hand?
- It'’s all right. I'll live.

41:18.911 --> 41:22.610
Thanks you all for coming.
Hope I didn'’t pull you
from anything important.

41:22.610 --> 41:24.699
I was dreaming
I was having
a nice cold bath.

41:24.699 --> 41:27.789
- Yeah, mine was
a swim in a pool.
- What'’s this about, Eva?

41:27.789 --> 41:30.009
We got the water reclamation
system working again.

41:30.009 --> 41:33.360
- Good!
- Don'’t get too excited.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.232
The best we could do
is 62% efficiency.

41:36.232 --> 41:38.234
Why do I get the feeling
that'’s not enough?

41:38.234 --> 41:40.585
I reclaimed all the water
from hydroponics,

41:40.585 --> 41:42.412
waste water, gray water.

41:42.412 --> 41:44.110
I even drained
the coolant system.

41:44.110 --> 41:46.460
With all that,
I bought us one,

41:46.460 --> 41:48.897
maybe two days
of drinking water.

41:48.897 --> 41:50.812
So that means we only
have four days of water left.

41:50.812 --> 41:53.032
Unbelievable. One damn knife
dumped in a water tank

41:53.032 --> 41:54.816
is going to kill us all.

41:54.816 --> 41:57.645
- How do you know that?
- What?

41:57.645 --> 42:01.823
I haven'’t told anyone
where the blade was introduced
to the water system.

42:01.823 --> 42:02.955
How do you know?

42:08.003 --> 42:11.616
When you said you shut down
the coolant system,

42:11.616 --> 42:13.574
did you mean
the engine coolant system?

42:13.574 --> 42:15.402
- Yes.
- We'’re dead in the water.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.273
What the hell
were you thinking?

42:17.273 --> 42:19.449
I was thinking we can
continue to run the engines

42:19.449 --> 42:21.582
even though
we have nowhere to go

42:21.582 --> 42:24.411
or we can have an extra couple
of days of drinking water.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.501
So you chose more days of life.
