WEBVTT

00:05.939 --> 00:07.041
Hey, Pop.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.277
You are loving
your new truck, huh?

00:09.377 --> 00:10.578
Did you buy or lease?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.446
Lease? I don't lease.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.681
Ain't nobody telling me

00:13.781 --> 00:16.284
how many miles I can
put on my own truck.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.820
Anyway, I was wondering,
what are you doing tomorrow?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.055
Any plans?

00:21.155 --> 00:23.524
No, I just plan
to relax and do nothing.

00:23.624 --> 00:27.195
So... whatever you have
in mind, it's a no.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.996
Okay, then.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.331
Uh, yo, Dave.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.832
Any plans tomorrow?

00:31.932 --> 00:33.167
Free as a bee.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.170
Well, what would you say
to field-level VIP tickets

00:36.270 --> 00:37.405
to the Dodgers game?

00:38.272 --> 00:39.473
Heck yeah.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.809
(laughs)
Uh, hell no.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.412
Why wouldn't
you ask your father?

00:44.512 --> 00:46.680
I did ask my father.
You said no.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.283
Well, that's when I thought
you were asking me to do

00:49.383 --> 00:51.785
something stupid,
like dinner.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.989
Look, I gave the boy life,
he's giving me the ticket.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.558
(laughs)

00:57.658 --> 01:00.361
Well, actually, Dave,
you and Grover can come, too.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.495
I got five tickets.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.597
One of the perks
of my job at USC.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.166
Oh, wow.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.568
Well, life has gone
full circle.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.104
I mean, I used to take you
to the game as a boy.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.872
Now, as a man,
you're taking me.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.542
Yeah.
(sniffles)
See, Malcolm,

01:14.642 --> 01:16.877
you got me all teary-eyed
in front of Dave.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.548
You know, this will be
me and Grover's

01:20.648 --> 01:22.183
first baseball
game together.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.352
A big milestone
in a boy's life.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.454
(chuckles)
Huh.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.889
Well, now I'm getting
teary-eyed.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.525
Hey, guys, what's going on?

01:31.625 --> 01:34.528
Dave,
are you crying?
Well, with joy.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.730
Malcolm got us Dodger tickets.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.200
It's gonna be father-son
day at Dodger Stadium.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.101
Aw, that's so sweet.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.670
I'm jealous.
I love baseball.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.906
Oh, well, you can come, too.
I got five tickets.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.175
Great. I'd love to.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.276
(laughing)

01:48.376 --> 01:50.043
What about Marty?

01:50.144 --> 01:52.980
Oh, Marty's got wedding stuff
with Mom and Necie tomorrow.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.148
Sucks for him.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.583
(chuckling):
Yeah, fantastic for me.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.050
Yeah.
(laughing)

01:57.151 --> 01:59.320
(laughing slowly)

01:59.420 --> 02:00.888
Yeah.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.491
What?

02:03.591 --> 02:04.858
What?
Huh.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.428
No.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.597
No, no, no, no.
It's, it's great.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.199
You know, I was just thinking
that it was gonna be

02:11.299 --> 02:12.600
a father-son thing,
but obviously

02:12.700 --> 02:13.867
it doesn't have to be.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.503
So, what, I'm gonna
mess that up?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.137
You can't have fun
if I'm there?

02:17.238 --> 02:18.706
No. No.
Not at all.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.908
It's just, you know,
when it's all the guys,

02:21.008 --> 02:24.412
we do guy things,
and if you're there...

02:24.512 --> 02:25.946
it's just different.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.781
Different how?

02:27.881 --> 02:29.417
Oh, damn.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.487
I was just thinking
it's-it's-it's

02:33.587 --> 02:36.590
the kid's first
baseball game, and...

02:36.690 --> 02:38.192
you know
how moms can be.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.560
No, I don't.
Tell me, Dave.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.463
Oh, damn.
Oh, damn.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.565
Well, you know moms--

02:44.665 --> 02:47.368
they're just always...

02:47.468 --> 02:49.203
mom-ing.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.207
"Don't do this"
or "Don't eat that."

02:53.307 --> 02:55.042
It just sort of
cramps our style.

02:56.143 --> 02:59.580
In a...
in a caring way.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.550
Well, I'm sorry you feel that
way, but I'm still coming.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.018
But how about
I promise you this?

03:05.118 --> 03:06.420
I won't be a mom at all.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.856
I won't even bring
hand sanitizer.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.292
It'll be like I'm
not even there.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.160
Sounds so good, Gemma.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.897
I saved that, right?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.499
(door slams)

03:19.333 --> 03:21.535
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

03:21.635 --> 03:22.936
* Welcome to the hood. *

03:27.708 --> 03:30.210
Yes! This is how
you do the ball game.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.546
Great seats that I didn't have
to pay for.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.781
(all laughing)

03:33.881 --> 03:36.049
Thank you, Malcolm.
Thank you, man.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.785
Thank you, son, so much.
Did I said thank you?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.488
(chuckles): Yeah, Pops,
you said it the whole ride.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.922
And through
the metal detector.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.090
And at the bathroom.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.293
But... let me hear it
one more time.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.027
Thank you, Malcolm.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.796
(laughs) You're welcome.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.963
Hey.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.567
All right, it
is going down.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.068
Mom, I'm hungry.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.170
Oh, Mom isn't here
today, honey.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.341
My name is Gemma,
and I'm drinking beer.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.877
Dad, I'm hungry.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.346
Well, yeah, sure thing.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.047
After the first inning,
we are gonna pig out.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.683
But I'm hungry now.
I'm starving.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.251
I'm light-headed.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.720
Okay, yeah.
You know what? Let's go.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.722
Get it out of the way now.
Good idea. Come on.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.223
(crowd cheering)
Okay-- oh.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.425
Ooh.
Hey, Mookie's up.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.460
Mookie!
Yeah, yeah, Mookie!

04:19.560 --> 04:21.762
Rip city,
you're the mayor.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.598
(whooping)

04:24.698 --> 04:26.066
(trills softly)

04:26.166 --> 04:28.702
Ah...

04:28.802 --> 04:31.339
(grunting)

04:39.913 --> 04:41.615
You and your
superstitions, Pops.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.585
Especially not blinking
while the first batter's up.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.186
That makes no sense.

04:47.621 --> 04:52.693
All I'm gonna say is,
2020 World Series champs.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.262
Well, what about literally
every other year?

04:55.363 --> 04:56.930
Those are the years I blinked.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.266
* *

05:00.901 --> 05:03.871
Okay. Mom, can we talk
about your guest list?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.205
Oh, what's there to talk about?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.541
Uh... well,
mine is 30 people.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.909
I've got 53.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.679
And, Mommy, yours is...

05:11.779 --> 05:14.648
I don't know because
I'm only on page eight.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.952
I cut down as much as I could.
I'm down to the bone.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.287
Down to the bone?

05:20.388 --> 05:22.556
Mama, Janice is on here.
You hate Janice.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.727
Yes, and I want her to see that
my kids are better than hers.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.631
Okay, fine.
I'll try to get it down.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.701
(imitating Yoda):
Do or do not.
There is no try.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.804
What'd you say to me?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.707
I think it's a Star Wars thing.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.741
Oh.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.275
It sure is.
Ah, but don't worry.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.812
(imitating Yoda):
Soon clear all will become.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.748
What is happening?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.116
Oh.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.218
Tonight, Necie and I
are watching Star Wars.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.753
I've never seen it.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.489
But Marty has acted out
every single scene for me.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.591
(chuckles softly)
It's adorable.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.894
Can I join you?
I've never seen it either.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.262
Mom, we watched
it together.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.731
It's one of my
fondest memories.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.967
Oh, sorry, baby.
I must have fallen asleep.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.836
Really, Mama?
How could you?

06:08.936 --> 06:10.337
Oh, don't get so upset.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.106
Moms have to catch their
sleep wherever they can.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.241
(chuckles softly)
I don't think

06:14.341 --> 06:16.510
I saw a minute
of his school plays.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.546
(chuckles)

06:18.646 --> 06:20.247
Wait, is that why
you said I was great

06:20.347 --> 06:21.615
as the Tin Man
in The Wiz?

06:21.715 --> 06:22.750
Baby, you were.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.818
I was the Cowardly Lion!

06:25.986 --> 06:26.954
(bat cracks)

06:27.054 --> 06:29.657
(cheering)
Boom, boom!

06:34.662 --> 06:35.696
No way.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.732
Did you see the way
Bellinger handled that pitch?

06:38.832 --> 06:42.269
Yeah, he handled-- he handled
it. That was something, Pops.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.304
Excuse me. Sorry.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.139
All right.
What did we miss?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.709
Ho-ho, you don't even
want to know, bro.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.646
Darn it. All right.
Let's go Dodgers!

06:52.746 --> 06:55.182
Did you get ketchup?
Oh, yeah.
It's right here.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.150
I need a napkin.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.553
Okay, hold on.
Here you go.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.589
I can't get this open.
Can you open it?
All right, yeah.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.956
Just give it to me.
Don't...

07:03.056 --> 07:04.224
There's a cup
in my cup holder.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.292
Okay, okay.
Just set it down here.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.894
Cheese is getting
on my pants.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.395
Okay, I'll take this. Now
there's cheese all over me.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.630
No...
My hot dog fell on the ground!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.164
Okay, all right.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.332
Here you go.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.967
Just eat it,
I'm sure it's fine.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.606
Dave, I think Grover's
gonna need another hot dog.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.708
Oh, and I'll take
another beer.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.978
All right.
Come on, buddy.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.213
(loud cheering)

07:26.313 --> 07:27.247
Oh, he's going, he's going.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.949
Yes!

07:29.049 --> 07:30.884
(whooping)

07:30.984 --> 07:32.219
Ah!

07:32.319 --> 07:33.887
Did you see Bellinger
steal second?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.022
Yeah, he's a thief,
Pops.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.423
That's cool,
that's cool.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.426
(groans)
You're not even looking.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.662
Oh, Pop, I'm looking.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.664
(bat cracks)
(crowd exclaims)

07:43.764 --> 07:46.700
Oh, come on.
Damn it, I missed that.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.502
Because I'm not
looking at the game,

07:48.602 --> 07:50.938
looking at you
not looking at the game.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.541
What is going on?

07:53.641 --> 07:55.375
All right, I-I spotted
a woman I know

07:55.475 --> 07:57.845
sitting a few rows back
to the right, but don't look.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.647
And...

08:02.249 --> 08:03.551
You both looked,
didn't you?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.986
I'm still looking.
I was a little curious.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.222
Her name is Kayla.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.458
And at first I was into it
and she was into it.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.793
But then I wasn't
so into it

08:12.893 --> 08:14.327
and she was, like,
really into it,

08:14.427 --> 08:15.729
so I had to get
the hell out of it.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.699
Trust me, if she sees me,
we're gonna get into it.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.068
So, you're gonna let
an ex-girlfriend

08:21.168 --> 08:22.970
ruin our perfectly good day?

08:23.070 --> 08:25.539
Pop, it won't be a perfectly
good day if she sees me.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.240
Trust me, you don't
want to see Kayla

08:27.340 --> 08:28.942
with a bat in her hands.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.344
* *

08:33.614 --> 08:35.716
Wait.
Pause, pause, pause.
Okay, okay.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.385
Remind me again why we're
starting with the fourth one?

08:38.485 --> 08:40.621
Oh, no, the fourth one
is the first one.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.890
So, is that like
a space thing?

08:44.191 --> 08:46.393
No. It's just the way
he told the story.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.329
And that garbage can
that goes "bleepy bloopy,"

08:49.429 --> 08:51.565
he needs the gold man to speak?

08:51.665 --> 08:53.400
Well, yeah.
He's a translator.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.603
But my Alexa can speak.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.506
My car can speak.
Right, but this is
a long, long time ago.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.541
But they have spaceships.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.777
It's a galaxy far,
far away!

09:06.113 --> 09:10.050
Look, can I just,
can I start the movie again?

09:12.519 --> 09:14.387
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

09:14.487 --> 09:16.657
I just got an email.
Keep going, it's fine.

09:16.757 --> 09:20.327
No. No, no, no, no. Okay.
No phones during Star Wars.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.664
He's acting like
he's in the movie.

09:23.764 --> 09:28.568
* For it's one, two,
three strikes you're out *

09:28.669 --> 09:33.440
* At the old ball game. *

09:33.540 --> 09:35.643
(cheering)
Dodgers!

09:35.743 --> 09:37.811
(whooping)

09:39.446 --> 09:41.048
Look at you, man.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.884
It's the seventh-inning stretch,
and you're not even stretching.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.418
Okay...

09:45.518 --> 09:47.621
What did you do to that woman?

09:47.721 --> 09:48.622
Nothing.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.691
It just didn't
work out, so...

09:51.591 --> 09:52.860
I ghosted her.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.663
Oh, so instead
of manning up

09:55.763 --> 09:57.665
and telling her
you're not interested,

09:57.765 --> 09:59.232
you just disappeared?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.568
Well, I wouldn't
put it like that.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.404
Well, how would
you put it?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.473
I would say
I cared so much

10:06.573 --> 10:09.142
about her feelings,
I avoided them.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.081
Okay, then, maybe it's not
too late to get things right.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.749
Oh, no, I think
it's too late.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.218
I don't know,
she looks sweet.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.887
Yeah? Well, check out
her texts.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.356
"I hope you go to hell."
Oh...

10:23.456 --> 10:24.958
I mean, it's not that bad.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.593
No, no, no. Keep reading.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.663
"You stupid..." Oh!
Oh!

10:30.630 --> 10:32.199
"And you can stick..."

10:32.299 --> 10:35.002
(stammers, clears throat)

10:35.769 --> 10:39.139
Yeah, she doesn't look
the way she texts.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.075
Excuse me. Sorry.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.745
All right.
(exhales)

10:44.845 --> 10:47.347
We should leave now so
we can beat the traffic.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.382
Come on.
Boo!

10:49.482 --> 10:50.951
Who brought this guy?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.285
No, I agree with Dave.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.787
We should go now
to beat the crowd.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.123
Plus...
my neck is killing me.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.625
Oh, you can blame
yourself for that.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.129
Dad, I'm cold.
Where's my jacket?

11:02.229 --> 11:03.731
Oh, I-I didn't bring one.

11:03.831 --> 11:07.134
I wish Mom was here.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.339
(exhales)

11:12.439 --> 11:14.574
Okay, let's go
buy you a jacket.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.609
And another ice cream.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.178
You just said
you were cold.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.080
Well, I won't be with a jacket.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.416
All right, come on.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.551
Oh, and while
you're there,

11:24.651 --> 11:26.186
hook a sister up
with a churro.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.255
Ooh, make that two, and
don't forget the caramel sauce.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.556
MALCOLM:
Hey, Dave.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.391
Dave, maybe
I should go with you.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.626
No, no, Malcolm,
you're gonna stay here

11:33.727 --> 11:35.462
and you'll watch this
game with your father.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.798
Come on, Pop.
You come on.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.199
You know what, Malcolm?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.368
I thought this could be
our new tradition.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.736
You treating me
to tickets.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.572
You know, father and son
at the ballpark,

11:45.672 --> 11:47.340
just like Field of Dreams.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.978
Except for there's no cornfield
and nobody's dead.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.213
Yeah, well, not yet.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.782
But if Kayla sees me,
that could change.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.616
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.886
I have never left
a Dodger game early,

11:58.986 --> 12:00.453
and I'm not gonna
start now.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.389
Plus, I've got
the car keys.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.590
So sit down!

12:03.690 --> 12:05.392
Everybody start watching
the game,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.727
and start having fun right now!

12:07.828 --> 12:10.063
Including you, sir!

12:17.170 --> 12:18.271
All right,
look at that.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.407
The Dodgers have
eight hits in.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.910
I've missed all of 'em.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.477
Nice jacket, Grover.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.879
My son's first
baseball game,

12:25.979 --> 12:28.548
and he will have
this memento forever.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.682
Ha!

12:29.783 --> 12:32.252
He'll grow out of it
in six months.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.654
I thought
you weren't here.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.956
I'm not.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.991
If I was, Grover would have
a hoodie from home.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.593
And a bag of carrots.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.930
Oh, look, look.
We're on the dance cam!

12:43.030 --> 12:44.097
Oh, look at that!

12:44.197 --> 12:45.933
Oh, give Daddy some room.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.575
Come on!

12:55.675 --> 12:57.277
Everything okay
down there, Dave?

12:57.377 --> 13:00.180
Oh, yeah,
Just making memories.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.315
* *

13:03.851 --> 13:06.887
Is that one an Ewok?
No.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.290
Is that one an Ewok?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.225
Babe, just, just watch.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.962
When does Billy Dee
Williams show up?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.597
Wait a minute.

13:17.697 --> 13:21.234
Is Billy Dee Williams an Ewok?
'Cause I don't play that.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.838
This movie is
too dry looking.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.707
(winces) I know,
it's making me thirsty.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.611
And you know, it takes too long
to get to the Ewoks.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.813
Ewoks aren't in this movie!

13:35.315 --> 13:36.716
They're in the third one.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.886
So the one
before this one.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.720
No, two after this.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.323
I mean,
come on, Marty.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.624
You got to admit
that's confusing.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.059
Oh, that is interesting.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.527
Because hundreds of
millions of people

13:47.627 --> 13:49.396
clearly do not find it
confusing.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.731
* *

13:53.533 --> 13:55.068
Can you believe
Dave and Malcolm

13:55.168 --> 13:56.336
wanted us to leave early

13:56.436 --> 13:58.105
and miss Freeman's
walk-off homer?

13:58.205 --> 14:00.140
Oh, actually,
Dave did miss it.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.708
Oopsies.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.179
We had a great time spending
the whole ninth inning

14:06.279 --> 14:07.680
looking for Dippin' Dots.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.517
We found 'em.
Yeah, we did.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.119
Yeah, I had a great time, too.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.555
Even though Malcolm ghosted me
like he did that woman.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.991
I guess that's just
what he does.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.793
I got you free tickets
and free parking.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.063
I don't hear you
complaining about that.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.266
(Grover vomits)
Grover!

14:26.366 --> 14:27.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.669
Did he get any of that
in my new truck?

14:29.769 --> 14:30.670
(mouths)

14:30.770 --> 14:34.007
I-I mean, is-is the boy okay?

14:34.107 --> 14:38.345
He's fine and, uh...
so is the truck.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.081
I-I think he just has
a little bit of a stomach bug.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.615
Uh, or...

14:42.715 --> 14:44.884
his father let him eat whatever
he wanted for four hours.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.419
He didn't have
that much.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.721
He literally ate
his height in hot dogs.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.591
Gemma, at this point
there's no reason

14:51.691 --> 14:53.026
for me to tell you
that were right.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.161
The proof is...

14:55.395 --> 14:57.497
...all over the parking lot.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.299
(quietly):
And on the upholstery.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.034
Ah...!

15:01.134 --> 15:02.302
I heard that.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.604
You owe me a full detail.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.608
I'm sorry that I said that
you were gonna ruin guys' night.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.710
But can you please be here now?

15:10.810 --> 15:13.947
Yes. And lucky for you,
I have wipes and Tums.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.048
Thank you.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.416
Look at this.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.518
This traffic is insane.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.554
We've been stuck
for like 20 minutes.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.156
I have to pee.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.158
At least.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.828
At least?
Probably more.
Okay.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.398
Oh, oh, please don't pee
or more in this truck.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.034
Hit the child lock...
I-I don't know
where the button is.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.969
Just hit the button.
It's a new truck.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.604
* *

15:37.704 --> 15:39.006
Hey.
Hey.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.274
You're missing your movie.
Yeah.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.509
We just got to the part

15:42.609 --> 15:44.344
where they fell
into the wet garbage...

15:44.444 --> 15:45.378
Ah.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.779
It's so cool.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.018
Necie, come on, you
think it's silly.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.552
No.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.323
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.858
So, why is it
important to us?

16:01.128 --> 16:02.662
Okay, look.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.065
I don't share this
with a lot of people...
Mm.

16:05.165 --> 16:09.436
...but the truth is,
I wasn't the coolest kid.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.138
What...?
Yeah.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.506
I know. Growing up
was rough for me.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.907
Like...
(stammers)

16:15.008 --> 16:16.376
I wasn't like the other
boys on the block.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.878
I didn't talk like them,
I didn't dress like them.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.249
Whenever we played basketball,
they called me Airball Butler.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.750
(chuckles)

16:23.850 --> 16:25.385
My dad came up
with that one.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.754
(gasps)
Babe.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.091
I spent a lot of time
looking for where I fit in.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.859
You know?

16:32.959 --> 16:37.697
Space and sci-fi movies
were like my escape.

16:37.797 --> 16:41.034
I mean, come on, I work
with rockets and robots.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.935
Where do you think
that came from?

16:44.437 --> 16:47.140
Seems like Airball Butler
got his dream.
Yeah.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.508
And he got the girl.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.243
See, you better
believe it.
Yeah, you know.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.279
I know.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.547
(speaking indistinctly)

16:54.647 --> 16:56.783
Mom, are you...?
Shh.

16:57.817 --> 16:58.785
Are you enjoying this?

16:58.885 --> 17:01.188
Yes, it's exciting,
and, look,

17:01.288 --> 17:04.023
that wizard guy's wearing
the same costume we made

17:04.124 --> 17:05.625
for your school
Halloween parade.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.127
Yeah, that's Obi-Wan Kenobi.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.229
Yes, Obi-Wan.
Oh.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.231
We made
his robes together.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.465
Oh, we had so much fun.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.866
I stayed up all night
sewing that thing.

17:13.966 --> 17:17.036
(chuckles)
He looked so cute.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.540
Mama, I did not look cute.
I was fierce.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.909
Now I remember
watching this movie.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.945
The guy in the black
football helmet...

17:26.045 --> 17:27.147
Yeah?
...he killed Obi.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.381
(gasps)

17:28.481 --> 17:30.417
And then
the big monkey man

17:30.517 --> 17:32.319
helped blow up
the Death Ball.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.821
That's it.
I knew it.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.258
Is that a spoiler?

17:38.358 --> 17:40.059
Several.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.729
* *

17:43.996 --> 17:46.799
Pop, I know you think
I took the easy way out,

17:46.899 --> 17:50.403
but... man, dating now is not
like it was in your day.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.838
My day?
Yeah.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.907
(chuckles) Some things
never change, Malcolm.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.177
I mean, you called it
ghosting, back in my day

17:57.277 --> 17:59.312
we called it
"hit it and quit it."

17:59.412 --> 18:00.513
(groans)

18:00.613 --> 18:03.250
It was foul then
and it's foul now.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.286
You're right.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.922
I promise, moving forward,
I will handle things better.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.491
But-but, hey,
at least you got to see

18:11.591 --> 18:13.025
a good game tonight, right?

18:13.126 --> 18:15.962
Why do you think I was
so excited about this game?

18:16.062 --> 18:18.398
Because you love the Dodgers.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.932
No, Malcolm.

18:20.032 --> 18:23.336
I was excited to spend
some quality time with you.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.338
Hell, I could've
watched the Dodger game

18:25.438 --> 18:27.807
at home in my drawers.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.246
And I spent the whole time
hiding from Kayla.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.514
Mm.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.083
I'm sorry, Pop.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.419
Hey, you want to watch
tomorrow night's game together?

18:39.519 --> 18:40.453
I'd love to.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.854
All right.
All right.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.290
You're gonna have to wear
some pants, though.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.757
Eh...

18:44.857 --> 18:46.793
We'll see about that.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.430
Okay.
GEMMA:
Ooh. (sighs)

18:50.530 --> 18:53.800
There are no Porta Potties
within a quarter-mile radius.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.835
I got to pee in a bush.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.538
Oh.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.040
Congratulations, Grover.
You are now a man.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.177
Nice.
Yeah, up top.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.681
Can I get a squeeze
of that hand sanitizer?
Yeah, mm-hmm.

19:08.781 --> 19:09.782
Oh, traffic's
starting to move.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.351
Hey, Malcolm,

19:11.451 --> 19:12.785
would you see if that
guy will let us in?
Yeah.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.321
(clears throat)

19:15.522 --> 19:17.324
Oh, my God, that's Kayla.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.726
That's Kayla?
Yeah.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.761
Oh, don't worry, I got this.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.095
Hey, Kayla!

19:24.731 --> 19:26.533
I got your boy Malcolm here.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.435
Malcolm?

19:28.535 --> 19:30.870
Hey, Kayla.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.405
Girl, we was just
talking about you.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.406
It was, um...

19:33.506 --> 19:34.874
It was a good game, huh?

19:34.974 --> 19:36.209
Good game?
Yeah.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.143
Good game?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.545
You've got a lot of nerve,

19:38.645 --> 19:41.748
you arrogant, two-faced-ed,
lying-ass dirtbag.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.250
How dare you ghost me?

19:43.350 --> 19:45.017
Yeah, but, Kayla, come on...
You know what, Malcolm?

19:45.117 --> 19:47.720
No, no. The less you say,
the sooner it'll be over.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.356
KAYLA:
You know what?

19:49.456 --> 19:50.757
You can kiss my ass.
Mm.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.660
Besides, you weren't
all that anyway,

19:53.760 --> 19:55.127
two-minute brother.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.929
CALVIN:
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.865
That's my son you're
talking about!

19:58.965 --> 20:01.000
Don't roll the window up.
Oh, hell no.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.402
Roll it back down,
back down.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.771
(overlapping arguments)

20:11.411 --> 20:13.713
I got my list
down to two pages.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.516
Oh, thanks.
That is reasonable.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.650
Mama.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.919
You just used a smaller font.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.090
Well, I thought you were
tripping about the pages,

20:24.190 --> 20:25.558
not the number of people.

20:27.026 --> 20:30.763
You met the caterer.
It's gonna cost $120 a plate.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.600
$120 a plate?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.102
Let me see that list.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.670
Uh-uh.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.372
Okay.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.841
(mutters)
Baby, you just crossed off
the whole church choir.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.677
Babe, if they ain't singing,
they ain't eating.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.047
Don't need him.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.182
Carlos ain't even got teeth.
What he gonna do...?

20:50.283 --> 20:51.984
(mutters)

20:52.084 --> 20:53.820
Ooh, I'm gonna keep Janice.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.756
I want her to see that
our kids are better than hers.
