37:15.859 --> 37:18.647
HERE WE HAVE A
HANDSOME LITTLE YACHT.

37:18.737 --> 37:22.651
BUT I ALREADY OVVN A 94-FOOTER

37:22.741 --> 37:25.779
THIS ONE MAKES THAT LOOK LIKE A DINGHY.
HANDSOME, ISN'T IT?

37:27.078 --> 37:31.072
<i>YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MASTERS? BUYING
THINGS ISN'T ANY FUN FOR ME ANYMORE.</i>

37:32.959 --> 37:35.075
BEFORE I HAD
MONEY, I--

37:35.128 --> 37:37.620
I USED TO LOOK FORWARD
TO BUYING A SECONDHAND CAR

37:37.714 --> 37:42.675
LIKE A...LIKE A KID
WAITING FOR CHRISTMAS.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.595

THERE'S NO HUNGERING.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.767

AH, YOU'RE FEELING
BLUE, MR. HANLEY.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.309
I USED TO ENJOY
LITTLE THINGS

37:53.396 --> 37:56.514
LIKE AN ICE CREAM CONE
WHEN IT WAS HOT,

37:56.608 --> 37:59.600
A BALL GAME,

37:59.694 --> 38:03.153
GETTING OUT OF THE APARTMENT
FOR A VVALK IN THE PARK.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.276
NOW EVERY TIME I GO
FOR A WALK IN THE PARK,

38:05.366 --> 38:09.030
FOUR PEOPLE COME UP AND ASK ME
VVHEN I'M GOING TO SUBDIVIDE IT.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.533
MASTERS, I'M GOING
TO QUIT BUYING THINGS.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.114
THAT'S SUBVERSIVE, SIR.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.166
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

<i>THAT'S UN-AMERICAN. SALESMANSHIP
IS OUR WAY OF LIFE.</i>

38:19.964 --> 38:22.456
THINK OF THOSE MEN LIVING
ON BLUE SKY AND A PRAYER,

38:22.550 --> 38:24.837
DEPENDING ON YOU
FOR THEIR DAILY COMMISSION.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.215
THEY'VE GOT LITTLE ONES,
MOUTHS TO FEED.

38:27.305 --> 38:31.390
<i>NO, MR. HANLEY, YOU CAN'T STOP BUYING,
EVER. BUYING IS YOUR DESTINY.</i>

38:31.476 --> 38:36.061
<i>DON'T WPNER NOW. DO YOUR DUTY, MR.
HANLEY. DO YOUR DUTY.</i>

38:36.147 --> 38:40.186

A GOOD CHAUFFEUR.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.709
