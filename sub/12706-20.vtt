00:01.102 --> 00:03.137
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.170 --> 00:05.971
Get dressed.
Finn stays in the brig.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.509
Helping an H.S.T. escape
is a court-martial offense.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.044
You're only gonna
 make matters worse.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.878
Talk later. Stealthy escape now.

00:11.912 --> 00:16.684
Buffy. If I leave now,
I can't ever come back.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.187
Spike, I want you
to come with me.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.689
You're going to help me
with my problem.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.623
I am going
to help you with yours.

00:25.225 --> 00:28.596
You have to be
with the person you lo-love.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.597
I am.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.533
It's complicated
because of Tara.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.070
Oh.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.704
Are you freaked?

00:37.737 --> 00:42.276
I have to tell you some
stuff... about my past.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.679
And it's not all stuff
that you're gonna like.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.183
And on Angel...
You didn't think
I was gonna find you, did you?

00:50.218 --> 00:51.884
This is not gonna happen.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.088
You're gonna stop me?
Don't do this.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.389
Faith, go.
Don't you move.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.091
Oh. Oh.

00:58.625 --> 01:01.561
I have someone
in my life now that I love.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.896
You don't know me anymore,
so don't come down here

01:03.930 --> 01:06.867
with your great new life and
expect me to do things your way.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.436
Go home.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.438
And the men?

01:11.471 --> 01:14.141
These are exceptional boys.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.710
Their capture ratio
just keeps increasing.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.379
They're keeping it together.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.981
Morale is a problem.

01:22.015 --> 01:25.753
The death of Professor Walsh,
the escape of the prototype--

01:25.786 --> 01:27.920
controlling the H.S.T.s
is getting harder.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.591
We have serious overcrowding
in the containment areas.

01:30.623 --> 01:31.992
Quite a mess.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.561
It's not my mess, sir.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.929
I'm just holding the fort
while you figure out

01:35.962 --> 01:37.965
what you want
to do with the place.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.471
This incident with Finn
was unfortunate.

01:43.503 --> 01:46.006
Fell in with a bad crowd.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.609
Quite frankly, I don't think
he was ever the soldier

01:48.641 --> 01:50.677
that you all hoped he was.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.111
Boy thinks too much.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.615
Nevertheless, we want him back.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.817
The government's
invested a substantial...

01:56.849 --> 01:58.451
We'll catch up to him.

01:58.485 --> 02:02.522
My feeling is he won't stray
too far from the girl.

02:02.555 --> 02:05.593
Yes, uh...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.528
Buffy Summers.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.461
Our data banks don't have much
on her.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.199
She's just a girl.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.634
(sighs)
She's a lot more than that.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.103
Slayer's dangerous,
is all I'm saying.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.104
Yes, she makes things
interesting.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.606
No. See,

02:19.639 --> 02:21.375
you're not getting
it, Mr. Bits.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.877
You're gonna be
interestingly dead.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.379
Little Miss Tiny's got the habit
of bollixing up the plans

02:26.413 --> 02:28.181
of every would-be
unstoppable bad-ass

02:28.216 --> 02:31.151
who sets foot in this town.

02:31.185 --> 02:34.788
Just want you to know,
when the big ugly goes down,

02:34.822 --> 02:36.557
Slayer's gonna be
right in the thick of it.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.658
You ready for that?

02:38.692 --> 02:41.562
I'm counting on it.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.000
(wolf howling)

02:47.033 --> 02:49.036
*

03:41.153 --> 03:42.689
ADAM:
Two slayers.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.191
That's right.

03:44.223 --> 03:46.192
And you killed them both?

03:46.225 --> 03:47.760
Yeah.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.796
I killed the hell out of them.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.799
Yet you fear this one.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.567
Hey, watch it, mate.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.302
I don't fear anything.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.903
Just know my enemies.

03:56.937 --> 04:00.640
Do you? Then why haven't you
killed this slayer yet?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.776
Because...

04:03.811 --> 04:05.812
stinking rotten luck is why.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.382
On top of that, now I've got
this buggering chip up my head.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.985
Yes, your behavior
modification circuitry.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.554
I know what you feel.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.955
(scoffs)
Not likely.

04:14.987 --> 04:16.290
You feel smothered.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.757
Trapped like an animal.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.459
Pure in its ferocity.

04:19.492 --> 04:22.295
Unable to actualize
the urges within.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.432
Clinging to one truth,

04:24.464 --> 04:27.800
like a flame, struggling to burn
within an enclosed glass.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.838
That a beast this powerful
cannot be contained.

04:30.870 --> 04:34.274
Inevitably, it will break free
and savage the land again.

04:35.843 --> 04:39.812
I will make you whole again,
make you savage.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.483
(sighs)
Wow.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.485
I mean, yeah.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.923
I get why the demons
all fall in line with you.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.524
You're like Tony Robbins,

04:51.558 --> 04:55.795
if he was a big, scary,
Frankenstein-looking...

04:55.829 --> 04:58.932
You're exactly
like Tony Robbins.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.000
I will restore you
to what you once were...

05:01.033 --> 05:05.204
when I have the slayer
how and where I want her.

05:05.237 --> 05:07.940
(sighs)
Easier said. She's crafty.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.143
Her and her little friends.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.644
Friends?

05:11.678 --> 05:15.115
There's your-- what
you call it-- variable.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.516
The slayer's got pals.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.050
You want her evening
the odds in a fight,

05:18.084 --> 05:20.521
you don't want her slayerettes
mucking about.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.055
Take them away from her.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.393
Well, there's a plan.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.528
She's working solo,
she won't have a chance

05:27.560 --> 05:29.997
to come after us
when the wild rumpus begins.

05:30.029 --> 05:31.899
(chuckles)
Plus,

05:31.932 --> 05:35.935
it'll make her miserable,
and I never get tired of that.

05:39.939 --> 05:42.175
Yeah.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.976
Leave 'em to me.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.879
You can't hurt them.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.882
What can you do to make sure
they're out of the picture?

05:48.915 --> 05:51.519
Not a blessed thing.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.252
They're gonna do it for me.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.959
(sniffs)

06:19.713 --> 06:21.449
(dog barking)

06:21.481 --> 06:23.350
RILEY:
 You know if she's back yet?

06:23.382 --> 06:25.918
L.A. Woman? Haven't
heard from her.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.422
She'll probably come here
first thing, though. Hey,

06:28.456 --> 06:31.891
who's your buddy? So you
don't have to be G.I. Joe

06:31.925 --> 06:33.293
while your civvies
are getting washed.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.694
Try those on.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.629
You'll feel like a new man.

06:36.663 --> 06:41.134
Would this man have a bright
red nose and big, floppy feet?

06:42.735 --> 06:46.305
Hey, sorry.
That's the cabin fever talking.

06:46.338 --> 06:50.143
But as post-apocalypse
splendor goes...

06:50.177 --> 06:51.812
I've done wonders
with the place.
Yeah.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.582
Still, the sooner Buffy
gets back, the better I'll feel.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.117
You and me
both, big guy.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.153
I take it you're not
an Angel fan, either.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.389
Well, it's not like
I hate the guy.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.494
Just, you know,
the guts part of him.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.394
Can't blame you.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.964
But to be fair, it's not him
you hate. It's the curse.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.904
Right?
Yeah.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.740
What did Buffy tell you?
About Angel?

07:20.774 --> 07:26.112
Everything. More than
I wanted to know sometimes.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.480
She loved him.

07:27.514 --> 07:31.317
He turned evil.
He, uh, killed people.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.754
She cured him. He left.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.524
Interesting little curse.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.026
One moment's happiness.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.994
What do you mean?

07:41.028 --> 07:43.262
You know, it's his trigger.

07:43.295 --> 07:46.800
Angel's an okay guy if
he's mopey and sad and brooding,

07:46.834 --> 07:49.836
but you give him even one second
of pure, real pleasure...

07:49.870 --> 07:52.939
And that sets him off.
Only in the big old

07:52.973 --> 07:54.675
"kill your friends" kind of way.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.711
And you know what
makes Angel happiest?

07:57.745 --> 08:00.848
I'll give you a hint.
It's not crème brûlée.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.319
Buffy.

08:14.326 --> 08:17.730
Sex with Buffy.

08:17.764 --> 08:23.971
She kind of left
that part out, huh?

08:24.004 --> 08:27.540
Yeah, she did.

08:30.377 --> 08:34.981
That explains a lot of things
that I wish weren't explained.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.884
Hey, man, that's all
ancient history.

08:37.918 --> 08:42.221
She went running to L.A.
to bone up on her history.
No!

08:42.254 --> 08:45.592
I'm sure it's boneless.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.327
She just needs to make
sure everything's okay.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.996
She's probably
back already.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.032
Maybe.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.368
You'll feel a lot
better when you see her.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.907
I guess we'll see.

09:03.610 --> 09:09.883
* If I leave here tomorrow

09:09.917 --> 09:14.988
* Would you still remember me?

09:17.090 --> 09:22.129
* Well, I must be
traveling on now *

09:23.963 --> 09:28.601
* There's too many places
I've got to see *

09:31.138 --> 09:36.009
* And if I stay here
with you, girl *

09:37.576 --> 09:41.749
* Things just
couldn't be the same *

09:44.150 --> 09:47.086
* Cause I'm as free as

09:47.120 --> 09:48.922
* A bird now...
(gasps)

09:48.956 --> 09:51.924
You know, for someone
who's got "watcher"

09:51.959 --> 09:54.161
on his resume, you might
want to cast an eye to the

09:54.193 --> 09:57.563
front door every now and again.
What do you want?

09:57.596 --> 10:02.669
Ah! Knew I left one.
Buffy around?

10:02.702 --> 10:05.371
Why?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.176
(beeping)
I need to speak
to the lady of the house.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.177
Hey, be a pet and give her
a message for me, would you?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.647
Tell here I just might have
something she just might want.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.982
And what might
that something be?

10:17.183 --> 10:19.152
Information.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.187
Highly classified.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.289
Not cheap, word-on-the-street
prattle, either.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.457
I'm talking about
the good stuff now.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.027
Thrill me.

10:27.059 --> 10:28.961
(scoffs)
It's nothing I know.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.963
What, you think
I'd come running over saying,

10:30.998 --> 10:32.365
"I've got a secret.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.500
Beat me till I talk"?

10:34.533 --> 10:36.269
There's files in the Initiative.
(beeping)

10:36.302 --> 10:38.437
I'm pretty sure I know where.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.340
(microwave door opens)

10:40.373 --> 10:41.875
Files?

10:41.908 --> 10:45.177
Yeah, secrets.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.148
Mission statements,
design schematics.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.551
All of Maggie Walsh's
dirty laundry,

10:51.584 --> 10:54.520
which I guess would include
lots of tidbits about...

10:54.553 --> 10:56.823
Adam.
Well, yeah.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.826
Say someone was
to risk his life and limb--

10:59.860 --> 11:03.196
well, limb, anyway-- to obtain
said files, might be worth

11:03.230 --> 11:05.365
a little something.
Now,

11:05.398 --> 11:07.466
at this point,
a cynical person might think

11:07.500 --> 11:11.839
that you are offering just what
we need when we need it most.

11:11.871 --> 11:15.708
That person'd be right, Rupert.
Supply and demand.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.677
And it won't be
cheap this time.
What do you want?

11:18.711 --> 11:22.249
Hmm, year's supply of blood,
guaranteed protection,

11:22.282 --> 11:25.184
merry bushels of cash,
and most important,

11:25.217 --> 11:28.687
a guarantee that I'm not
to be in any way slain.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.357
Done.

11:31.390 --> 11:34.727
With a smile
and a nod from you?

11:34.761 --> 11:37.063
Sorry. Not close
to good enough.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.664
This deal's with the slayer.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.567
I'll tell her.
Oh, you'll tell her?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.070
Great comfort that!

11:43.102 --> 11:45.371
What makes you think
she'll listen to you?

11:45.404 --> 11:47.073
Because.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.210
Very convincing.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.211
I'm her watcher.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.383
I think you're neglecting
the past tense there, Rupert.

11:56.415 --> 11:59.418
Besides, she barely listened
to you when you were in charge.

11:59.451 --> 12:02.688
I've seen the way
she treats you.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.724
Ah, yes. And how's that?

12:04.758 --> 12:07.193
Very much like
a retired librarian.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.298
Look, I've got what she wants
as long as she has what I want.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.769
Spread the word.
She knows where to find me.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.905
I'll think about it.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.073
(door opens, door closes)

12:21.107 --> 12:25.044
Ugh. I keep thinking, "Okay,
that's the cutest thing ever."

12:25.077 --> 12:27.279
(cat mews)
And then she does
something cuter

12:27.313 --> 12:29.817
and completely resets
the whole scale.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.318
Did you see
her yawn earlier?
Yes.

12:32.351 --> 12:35.488
I thought I
was gonna die!
(laughs)

12:35.522 --> 12:37.724
Oh, I love you,
Miss Kitty Fantastico!

12:37.756 --> 12:40.293
We've got to get her
a real name.
(mews)

12:40.326 --> 12:42.761
It's so cool
that she's ours.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.996
(mewing)

12:44.030 --> 12:46.133
Uh, yours.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.567
That she's yours is-is cool.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.636
She can be ours if you want.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.006
You still need an elective.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.609
How about...
sophomore-level

12:56.643 --> 12:58.510
psychology?
Oh.

12:58.544 --> 13:02.014
Kind of psyched out
since Professor Walsh.

13:02.048 --> 13:05.152
Maybe something
fun, like drama.

13:05.184 --> 13:07.354
I could be dramatic.
(mews)

13:07.386 --> 13:10.123
"You cannot have more catnip!

13:10.157 --> 13:13.759
You have a catnip problem."

13:13.793 --> 13:16.363
Definitely drama.
(meowing)
Ah.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.168
I haven't even dealt
with the housing situation yet.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.870
Have you done anything?

13:22.903 --> 13:26.273
I hear there's some off-campus
places that are way cool

13:26.306 --> 13:29.042
for groups to, you know, go in
on.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.379
Oh, I just figured you'd be
dorming it up with Buffy again.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.681
We haven't really
talked about it.

13:34.713 --> 13:37.649
I used to assume we'd be
roomies through grad school,

13:37.683 --> 13:40.153
well into little old
ladyhood, you know,

13:40.187 --> 13:42.355
cheating at bingo
together and...

13:42.389 --> 13:44.624
forgetting to
take our pills.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.025
But?

13:47.326 --> 13:49.863
But...I don't know.

13:49.897 --> 13:54.067
It hardly feels like
we're roomies now.

13:54.100 --> 13:58.437
I mean, she's busy with Riley,
and I'm gone a lot, too.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.375
Guess I should ask her.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.177
(cat meows)

14:05.211 --> 14:08.847
(indistinct crowd chatter
and shouting)

14:08.881 --> 14:11.283
(knocking)

14:13.253 --> 14:15.087
Riley.

14:15.121 --> 14:18.691
I, uh, got a little tired
of sitting around waiting, so...

14:20.293 --> 14:22.394
You joined the circus?

14:22.428 --> 14:25.532
Xander took my clothes to
clean them, left me these.

14:25.565 --> 14:29.235
Does he, uh, hate me in some
way I don't know about yet?

14:29.269 --> 14:32.871
I think I would've attracted
less attention in my uniform.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.209
Is it okay for you to be here?

14:37.443 --> 14:39.211
You tell me.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.081
I just meant
with that government branch

14:42.115 --> 14:43.615
hunting you down and all.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.952
I'm good.

14:45.985 --> 14:51.591
It, uh, took me a while, but
I patched into their frequency.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.059
MAN (on radio):
Man, this is alpha one...

14:53.092 --> 14:54.860
Can't sneak up on a guy
if he's listening in.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.763
You're the sneakiest.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.399
Why they hired me.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.506
You okay?

15:10.509 --> 15:12.912
Yeah. I just...

15:14.114 --> 15:16.416
Angel kind of upset me.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.917
How?

15:19.152 --> 15:20.720
It...

15:20.753 --> 15:22.288
It's not that interesting.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.124
Got my attention.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.629
He just spun my head a little.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.633
You don't want to talk about it.

15:33.665 --> 15:36.068
It's just
deconstructing Angel can wait.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.638
Right now, I just want
to get out there and patrol

15:38.671 --> 15:40.606
and-and find Adam.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.110
We can talk about it later.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.578
It's the pants, isn't it?
(chuckles)

15:46.613 --> 15:48.181
It's okay.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.649
I couldn't take me seriously

15:49.682 --> 15:51.484
in these things, either.
Riley,

15:51.518 --> 15:53.120
it's not that big a deal.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.154
I'll tell you what.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.157
Why don't I get out
of your face?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.658
You had a long trip.

15:58.691 --> 15:59.993
Look, you don't have to go.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.294
It's okay.

16:02.328 --> 16:04.797
Besides... I have to
recharge them every two hours,

16:04.831 --> 16:06.298
or they go dead on me.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.035
Okay.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.004
(door opens)

16:11.038 --> 16:13.840
(door closes)

16:16.208 --> 16:19.145
Here. You should've just saved
the ensemble from the last time

16:19.178 --> 16:21.280
we snuck into the Initiative.
I'm not a clothing delivery

16:21.313 --> 16:23.216
service.
Well, he is, kind of.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.884
He did Riley yesterday.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.056
Hello.

16:29.088 --> 16:33.059
This is just... swell.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.994
(sighs)

16:35.028 --> 16:37.730
Got to say,
liking this quite a lot.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.067
Kind of changes the
balance of pow...

16:40.100 --> 16:41.368
Ow!

16:41.400 --> 16:43.202
Aah! Oh!

16:43.235 --> 16:45.337
Come on! You got
to be kidding!

16:45.371 --> 16:47.039
Wow. That chip
in your head means

16:47.073 --> 16:49.542
you can't even point a gun?
How humiliating.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.178
Doesn't work, anyway.
It's a fake.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.846
ANYA:
Can't even point

16:53.879 --> 16:55.581
a decorative gun? Hmm.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.250
Give it up
for American chipmanship.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.251
It doesn't work?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.986
What about self-defense?

17:01.019 --> 17:03.022
I'm taking a risk here,
you know.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.726
Can I tell you how much
I really... don't care?

17:06.759 --> 17:09.194
Attitude. See how far

17:09.229 --> 17:11.564
that'll take you in boot camp.

17:11.597 --> 17:15.201
Say, I hope you get one of those
tough-as-nails drill sergeants

17:15.233 --> 17:17.002
who's only hard on the men
'cause he's trying

17:17.036 --> 17:18.938
to keep 'em alive
when the bullets start flying.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.940
I love that stuff.
Boot camp?

17:20.972 --> 17:23.375
Yeah, like I'd go there.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.578
What, you change your mind?
Not gonna join?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.281
You're joining
the army?!

17:29.316 --> 17:31.584
Okay. One-- ow.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.920
Two-- where'd you
get that idea?

17:33.952 --> 17:35.887
Three-- ow!
I'm not

17:35.922 --> 17:37.390
joining the army!

17:37.423 --> 17:39.425
Well, good.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.394
Stopped that nonsense
just in time.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.930
I was never...
(sucking on straw)

17:43.962 --> 17:45.432
Who'd you hear this from?

17:45.464 --> 17:46.898
Oh, your girlie-mates
were talking.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.635
Something about, uh...
being all you can be

17:49.669 --> 17:51.238
or all you can be.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.106
Uh... having a laugh.
Figured you were signing up.

17:54.141 --> 17:57.477
Say, have you got anything
larger in the... toy gun line?

17:57.509 --> 18:00.380
All I can...
Can you believe this?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.048
Like I'm some sort
of useless lunk.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.250
It happens that I'm good
at a lot of things.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.586
I help out with all kinds of...
stuff.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.222
I have skills and... stratagems.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.159
I'm very...

18:12.192 --> 18:13.593
Help me out.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.060
He's a Viking in the sack.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.263
Terrific. You didn't
have these cleaned

18:17.297 --> 18:18.931
after the last time, did you?

18:18.964 --> 18:20.467
This is so like them lately.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.335
It's all about them
and the college life.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.103
Well, you know
what college is?

18:24.136 --> 18:26.806
It's high school, only without
the actual going to class.

18:27.839 --> 18:29.976
Well... high school was

18:30.009 --> 18:31.778
kind of like that, too,
but the point is, is

18:31.810 --> 18:33.512
is I'm out there working hard
to make a living.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.347
It's nothing
but a huge joke to them.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.083
Xander got fired from Starbucks.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.286
Xander got fired
from that phone sex line.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.086
They look down on you.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.755
And they hate you.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.123
But they don't look down on me.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.526
Hey, it was just a laugh.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.126
There's no need to
go insane over it.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.863
Is anybody talking to you?

18:50.896 --> 18:52.664
Sir, no, sir!

18:54.500 --> 18:57.203
(birds chirping)

19:06.578 --> 19:09.215
Don't shoot.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.851
Give me a reason not to.
You're killing humans now?

19:11.884 --> 19:15.054
Not yet. Beating you senseless
should do just fine.

19:15.086 --> 19:16.855
I could have a patrol here
in under a minute.

19:16.888 --> 19:20.092
So here's a plan:
you go your way, I'll go mine.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.701
I'm checking out that cave.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.136
My orders exactly.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.505
Alone?

19:32.538 --> 19:35.307
We're spread a little thin,
so yeah.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.710
Family's tearing apart.
Family.

19:37.743 --> 19:41.012
What kind of family are you,
the Corleones?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.584
Weren't until
you showed up.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.488
(sighs)
What, no girls
in the club?

19:48.520 --> 19:51.657
You think you're the first
girlfriend Riley's ever had?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.992
Such a big head on that
skinny little body.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.895
No, you're just the first one
to get him to commit treason.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.330
Riley had a career.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.932
He had a future
till he met you, and, yeah,

19:59.965 --> 20:01.367
I got a problem with that.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.835
A future?

20:02.868 --> 20:05.704
A future doing what,
illegal experiments?

20:05.738 --> 20:08.074
Torture? Murder?

20:08.106 --> 20:10.777
I guess killing someone isn't
really a problem for you.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.345
Less and less.
Now why don't you

20:12.378 --> 20:13.779
get the hell out of here
before I...?
Touch me,

20:13.813 --> 20:15.914
and you'll find out
what slayer strength is like.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.916
I think it's about time
you showed me, then.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.385
ADAM:
Yes.

20:19.419 --> 20:23.122
I think that would be
interesting.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.131
(grunting)

20:32.163 --> 20:34.232
Get out of here!
(groans)

20:34.267 --> 20:39.105
(grunting)

20:39.137 --> 20:41.240
Not moving.
(whooshing)

20:41.273 --> 20:45.577
(groaning, whooshing)

20:45.612 --> 20:47.646
Thank you.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.981
Go! Get out!

20:50.016 --> 20:51.284
(grunting)
(groaning)

20:51.317 --> 20:52.451
BUFFY:
No!
(groans)

20:54.953 --> 20:57.423
(Buffy groans)
(weapon whirring)

20:57.457 --> 20:59.491
Oh, God.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.760
(whirring)
(grunts)

21:03.329 --> 21:05.332
(whirring, explosion)

21:13.506 --> 21:16.476
(grunting)

21:25.284 --> 21:27.286
(insects trilling)

21:31.790 --> 21:33.025
(sighs)

21:38.197 --> 21:39.465
(exhales deeply)

21:39.499 --> 21:41.500
(quick breaths)

21:42.701 --> 21:45.136
I think I lost
the buggers.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.538
Any luck with the disk?

21:46.573 --> 21:47.807
Well...

21:47.839 --> 21:49.541
Took what they had.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.809
Should be something useful
on one of them.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.211
Hope so.

21:53.244 --> 21:54.814
What are we looking for?

21:54.846 --> 21:56.883
Anything about Adam.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.851
Any problems
getting in and out?

21:58.884 --> 22:01.119
No. I mean, a couple of 'em made
me on the way out,

22:01.153 --> 22:02.521
but I took care of them.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.891
Gave them a good
running-away-from, did you?

22:05.924 --> 22:07.226
Well, yeah.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.728
When do I get paid?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.663
When Willow tells me

22:10.696 --> 22:14.032
you've brought us
something useful.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.867
(typing, beeping)

22:23.442 --> 22:24.676
I could've
gone straight

22:24.711 --> 22:26.479
to the slayer,
you know.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.913
I cut you in,
let you pretend

22:27.946 --> 22:29.648
you're actually
in charge.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.217
Now you've
got to wait for
Red's permission

22:31.250 --> 22:32.818
to finish the deal?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.688
As soon as we see
what's on the disks.

22:35.721 --> 22:38.124
It looks like gibberish.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.692
Gibberish?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.528
They're encrypted.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.329
Oh, wonderful.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.932
SPIKE:
Can you fix 'em?

22:45.964 --> 22:49.536
Crack a government
encryption code on my laptop?

22:49.568 --> 22:52.203
Easy as really
difficult pie.

22:52.238 --> 22:55.074
You're not exactly the whiz
these days, either.

22:55.106 --> 22:56.776
God, I'm never
gonna get paid.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.344
I am a whiz.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.846
She is a whiz.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.448
If ever a whiz there was.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.715
I-I just need some time.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.217
No, I just heard you weren't...

23:05.250 --> 23:06.919
Your mates said

23:06.952 --> 23:09.288
you weren't playing
with computers so much.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.722
Into the new thing.

23:10.757 --> 23:11.958
What new thing?

23:11.990 --> 23:13.358
You know, you two.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.094
The whole Wicca thing.

23:15.126 --> 23:18.064
They-they were
talking about that?

23:18.096 --> 23:19.298
Could we get back
to business here?

23:19.330 --> 23:20.732
I've got a deal at stake.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.634
What did they say?

23:22.669 --> 23:24.069
Talking about,
you know, it's a phase.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.403
You'll get over it.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.705
What?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.775
Who said that?

23:28.807 --> 23:30.276
Was it Buffy?

23:30.308 --> 23:31.544
'Cause you know
what she means by that.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.144
No, she was
defending you.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.413
'Cause Xander said you were
just being trendy.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.415
Trendy?
I don't know

23:37.450 --> 23:38.651
what they were going on about.

23:38.684 --> 23:39.919
Person wants to be a witch,

23:39.951 --> 23:41.921
that's their business.

23:42.954 --> 23:44.990
I knew Buffy was freaked.

23:45.023 --> 23:46.659
You should talk to her,
'cause I'm sure...

23:46.692 --> 23:48.394
Pressing business,
ladies.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.162
Don't want to get
sidetracked.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.598
Still got your
monsters to fight.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.635
Cell capacity's maxed out
three days ago, sir.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.471
We keep up this pace,
there'll be nowhere left

23:58.505 --> 23:59.739
to contain the hostiles.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.307
They're animals,
Lieutenant.

24:01.339 --> 24:02.642
We pack 'em in
till we're out of room,

24:02.674 --> 24:05.778
then we pack 'em
in some more.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.846
They're going to
start tearing each
other apart, sir.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.648
I have no problem
with that scenario.

24:11.049 --> 24:13.051
(indistinct chatter)

24:15.788 --> 24:18.758
SOLDIER (on radio):
...backup. Request
immediate backup, over.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.861
They're tearing us apart
over here. Two men down...

24:21.894 --> 24:24.830
...from out of nowhere...
Mayday, repeat...

24:24.864 --> 24:26.132
Mayday!

24:27.834 --> 24:29.468
SOLDIER:
...requesting
immediate backup.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.470
We're in the alley
near the school building!

24:31.503 --> 24:34.606
Where the hell is...
...back! Fall back!

24:34.641 --> 24:35.842
It's coming this...

24:35.875 --> 24:37.143
(static)

24:42.381 --> 24:44.683
(groans)

25:03.035 --> 25:04.737
Riley Finn.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.875
I know you?

25:08.907 --> 25:11.743
We have a friend in common.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.115
Angel.

25:20.752 --> 25:23.021
Welcoming committee
your idea?

25:27.727 --> 25:29.260
Way I heard it,

25:29.295 --> 25:31.262
you were all
peaceable now.

25:31.297 --> 25:32.832
You didn't by any chance

25:32.865 --> 25:34.933
go and lose that pesky soul
again, did you?

25:34.967 --> 25:36.969
Don't push me, boy.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.840
Now, what possibly
could've happened with Buffy

25:41.874 --> 25:43.843
that would make you
lose your soul?

25:43.875 --> 25:45.744
That'd be between me and her.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.681
Where do you think
you're going?

25:48.714 --> 25:50.717
Going to see
an old girlfriend.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.183
Oh, you really think
I'm gonna let that happen?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.519
Think you're gonna stop me?

25:53.551 --> 25:55.622
I surely do.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.790
(grunting)

26:00.291 --> 26:01.559
(crashes)

26:11.403 --> 26:13.404
(grunting)

26:21.780 --> 26:23.582
(electric crackling)

26:30.588 --> 26:32.523
(electric crackling)

26:42.868 --> 26:44.202
(vehicles approaching)

27:01.019 --> 27:03.021
*

27:27.645 --> 27:29.214
Angel.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.517
Hi. Can I come in?

27:31.549 --> 27:34.052
I guess.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.455
Um, I need a little more
than that.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.358
Oh. Um...

27:40.392 --> 27:41.827
come in.

27:51.537 --> 27:52.739
You're hurt.

27:52.771 --> 27:54.973
You, too.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.175
I'll live.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.680
You want to tell me who ran
your face into that doorknob?

28:01.713 --> 28:04.549
Not really. It's not
world-in-peril stuff.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.685
Let me guess.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.555
You thought of something else
really hurtful to say,

28:09.587 --> 28:11.723
and, well, you couldn't
tell me on the phone

28:11.758 --> 28:14.093
because the funniest part
is that look on my face...
Buffy, please.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.728
I really don't have
a lot of time.

28:17.695 --> 28:18.931
What's going on?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.036
I told you you weren't
coming near her.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.273
You've got to be kidding me.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.708
This is why you came?

28:29.741 --> 28:30.777
No.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.278
This was an accident.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.447
Running your car into a tree
is an accident!

28:35.480 --> 28:37.583
Running your fist
into somebody's face is a plan.

28:37.615 --> 28:39.786
Please explain
this to me.

28:39.818 --> 28:41.386
Put that gun down.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.255
It's pretty much all I got left,

28:43.288 --> 28:45.791
so I'm thinking not.

28:45.825 --> 28:46.959
He attacked
four of my men, Buffy.

28:46.992 --> 28:48.693
I think he's up to
his old tricks.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.461
He won't hurt anybody.
Tell him.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.529
Might hurt you.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.464
Oh, please try.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.934
Huh. Some threat.
You can barely stand.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.536
My trigger finger feels okay.

28:57.568 --> 28:58.805
You actually sleep
with this guy?

29:00.006 --> 29:02.273
Okay, stop it!

29:02.307 --> 29:03.910
Okay, that is enough.

29:03.942 --> 29:06.377
I see one more display
of testosterone poisoning,

29:06.412 --> 29:07.814
and I will personally put
you both in the hospital.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.585
Anybody think I'm exaggerating?

29:13.618 --> 29:15.186
He start...

29:25.463 --> 29:26.798
Riley...

29:26.833 --> 29:29.734
I'm sorry.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.171
Just wanted to know
that you were safe.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.240
I need to talk to Angel
for a minute.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.442
What?

29:36.474 --> 29:37.876
Riley, please.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.750
I'm not leaving this room.

29:44.782 --> 29:47.719
I mean it.

29:51.656 --> 29:52.892
(door opens)

30:02.167 --> 30:04.470
Not moving a muscle.

30:04.502 --> 30:09.208
Okay, I come to see you,
to help you,

30:09.240 --> 30:12.711
and you treat me like
I'm just... your ex.

30:12.743 --> 30:14.212
Well, technically...
Shut up!

30:14.246 --> 30:17.215
And then you order me
out of your city,

30:17.249 --> 30:18.683
and then you come here

30:18.717 --> 30:20.952
and start pounding
on my boyfriend?

30:20.987 --> 30:23.021
I would really like to know,

30:23.055 --> 30:25.457
what the hell are you
trying to do?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.758
I was trying
to make things better.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.398
(laughs)

30:34.032 --> 30:35.567
(chuckles)

30:35.601 --> 30:37.669
Well...

30:37.702 --> 30:38.904
(laughs)

30:38.938 --> 30:41.240
Aw, well...

30:41.272 --> 30:44.375
Huh. It's, uh...

30:44.410 --> 30:46.811
going pretty good,
don't you think?

30:46.845 --> 30:49.315
Swell.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.349
You know... (chuckles)

30:52.784 --> 30:55.186
I couldn't leave it like that.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.590
The way I spoke to you...

30:59.625 --> 31:01.027
I came to apologize.

31:01.059 --> 31:03.061
I... I had no right.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.531
And Riley?

31:06.565 --> 31:07.766
I got jumped by some soldiers.

31:07.798 --> 31:09.768
He came in in the middle.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.869
And he wasn't real forthcoming
with the benefit of the doubt.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.307
Put yourself in his place.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.479
I get it.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.049
Look...

31:26.617 --> 31:29.488
...you weren't entirely wrong,
what you said in L.A.

31:33.159 --> 31:36.061
We don't live
in each other's
worlds anymore.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.895
I had no right
to barge in on yours

31:37.930 --> 31:39.498
and make judgments.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.800
I'm still sorry.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.238
Thank you.

31:47.272 --> 31:48.473
And next time,

31:48.507 --> 31:51.042
I'll apologize by phone.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.578
(laughs)

31:53.612 --> 31:55.747
Things are pretty tense
around here.

31:58.984 --> 32:00.885
They really are.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.753
Can I do anything?

32:02.788 --> 32:05.723
Honestly...

32:05.757 --> 32:08.493
I think the best thing
you can do right now is...

32:08.527 --> 32:09.795
Okay.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.365
It means a lot that you came.

32:23.642 --> 32:28.114
Oh, and... Riley?

32:28.146 --> 32:30.582
Yeah?

32:30.615 --> 32:33.285
I don't like him.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.355
Thank you.

32:37.388 --> 32:40.058
*

32:55.740 --> 32:58.044
(beeping)
(door closes)

33:00.979 --> 33:04.282
Now, that... was fun.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.317
You were successful?

33:06.352 --> 33:07.653
Oh...

33:07.685 --> 33:09.221
Easier than
I thought it'd be, too.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.655
You're sure?
(scoffs)

33:10.689 --> 33:11.990
Feel it in my bones.

33:12.023 --> 33:15.260
It's, uh...
call it the Yoko factor.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.663
(lighter clicks)

33:18.696 --> 33:21.799
Don't tell me you've never
heard of The Beatles.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.136
I have. I like "Helter Skelter."

33:25.171 --> 33:27.506
What a surprise.

33:27.538 --> 33:30.909
The point is, they were once
a real powerful group.

33:30.942 --> 33:32.978
It's not a stretch to say
they ruled the world.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.513
When they broke up,
everyone blamed Yoko,

33:35.547 --> 33:37.682
but the fact is,
the group split itself apart.

33:37.715 --> 33:38.916
She just happened to be there.

33:38.950 --> 33:41.186
But you know
how it is with kids.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.555
They go off to college,
they grow apart.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.191
Way of the world.

33:45.223 --> 33:47.593
So you separated the slayer
from her friends.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.228
I'm pleased.

33:52.931 --> 33:55.366
Well, since we've got
all our ducks in a row

33:55.401 --> 33:58.203
and not talking to each other,

33:58.237 --> 34:00.506
guess it's time for
the grand plan, huh?

34:00.538 --> 34:03.008
You know, the one where
I get the chipectomy.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.875
You got everything
you need, right?

34:04.910 --> 34:06.112
No.

34:06.144 --> 34:08.614
There's one more thing.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.228
How bad are you hurt?

34:22.260 --> 34:25.130
Dunno yet.
Night's still young.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.202
Riley, I have
to tell you something.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.038
Figured.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.773
Maybe you
want to sit down.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.509
I'm fine.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.878
Riley, I...

34:39.911 --> 34:41.646
Wait.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.081
Me first.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.320
Buffy...

34:49.355 --> 34:51.956
I feel like
we've gotten really close.

34:51.989 --> 34:55.594
At least, I thought we had.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.063
I don't know much about Angel

34:58.096 --> 35:03.001
or your relationship
with him, but...

35:03.034 --> 35:05.137
all I ask is,

35:05.170 --> 35:08.306
if you're gonna break my heart,
do it fast.

35:10.141 --> 35:12.443
What?

35:12.478 --> 35:14.280
You think that Angel and I...

35:14.313 --> 35:17.014
Didn't you?

35:17.047 --> 35:18.849
No.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.318
Of course not.

35:22.052 --> 35:24.289
How can you even ask me that?

35:26.391 --> 35:29.094
(sighs) I don't know.
Xander said...

35:29.126 --> 35:31.929
Xander? Oh, he's
the deadest man in Deadonia.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.166
No, it's not his fault.

35:34.199 --> 35:37.635
I prodded,
and he explained

35:37.668 --> 35:39.338
how Angel went bad.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.306
I mean, the trigger.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.708
Oh.

35:43.742 --> 35:47.878
And after that, I went
a little nuts, you know?

35:47.913 --> 35:52.518
I mean, on the one hand,
I should believe in us,

35:52.550 --> 35:54.519
but on the other,

35:54.552 --> 35:56.722
sometimes things happen
between exes,

35:56.755 --> 35:58.155
and when I saw
that he was bad...

35:58.190 --> 36:00.759
He's... not bad.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.661
Seriously?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.530
That's a good day?

36:07.498 --> 36:09.235
Well, there you go.
Even when he's good,

36:09.268 --> 36:11.637
he's all Mr. Billowy Coat,
King of Pain,

36:11.670 --> 36:12.871
and girls really...

36:12.903 --> 36:14.105
Riley, stop.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.909
See? Nuts.

36:23.349 --> 36:27.253
Have I ever given you
any reason

36:27.286 --> 36:29.420
to feel that
you can't trust me?

36:30.556 --> 36:33.324
No.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.193
Then why
with the crazy?

36:38.429 --> 36:41.266
Because I'm so in love with you
I can't think straight.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.204
Tell me about it.

36:53.311 --> 36:54.579
Riley.

36:56.213 --> 36:59.050
I still have
to tell you something,

36:59.083 --> 37:00.751
and there's no easy way...

37:00.786 --> 37:02.119
Just say it.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.126
Forrest is dead.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.632
I'm so sorry.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.103
There was a fight.

37:18.135 --> 37:20.371
Adam killed him.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.672
I barely got away.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.211
I know there's
nothing that I can say

37:27.244 --> 37:30.315
that's gonna
make this better,

37:30.349 --> 37:33.918
but we will find this thing
and destroy it.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.722
I have to go.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.324
Are you sure?

37:39.358 --> 37:41.992
I have to go now.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.503
(door closes)

37:51.536 --> 37:53.338
WILLOW:
It's still encrypted.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.943
Willow's working
really hard on it.

37:57.976 --> 38:02.012
Okay. Well, how long
before you un-crypt it?

38:02.047 --> 38:04.682
Hours? Days, maybe?

38:04.715 --> 38:06.318
Anyone suggesting months

38:06.351 --> 38:08.619
would not be accused
of crazy talk.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.255
GILES:
Whatever happened to Latin?

38:10.288 --> 38:14.425
At least when that made
no sense, the church approved.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.327
I can't just
wait around, Will.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.996
That disk is no good to me
unless you crack it soon.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.331
ANYA:
Hey!

38:20.365 --> 38:22.701
We worked really hard
getting that.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.702
Xander delivered clothing.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.637
"Church approved."

38:26.672 --> 38:28.974
Sorry, you guys.
We're on a clock here.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.842
Okay, Adam was
at that cave,

38:30.876 --> 38:32.277
so maybe he was there
for a reason.

38:32.309 --> 38:33.545
I-I could,
I could go back,

38:33.579 --> 38:35.179
scope it out,
track him if I have to.

38:35.213 --> 38:38.483
Right, and then maybe
you'll get lucky

38:38.516 --> 38:40.952
and he'll still be there,
and he can rip

38:40.985 --> 38:42.487
your arms off for you.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.889
Buffy, you can't go back alone.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.190
You never train with me anymore.

38:45.222 --> 38:46.525
He's going to kick your ass.

38:46.557 --> 38:47.626
Giles.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.960
Sorry. Was that a bit honest?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.528
Terribly sorry.

38:50.561 --> 38:53.063
So she doesn't go alone.
Giles, weapons all around.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.300
You're not going, Xander.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.202
You'd get hurt.

38:57.235 --> 39:00.304
Oh...

39:00.338 --> 39:02.474
Okay, you and Willow
go do the superpower thing.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.242
I'll stay behind
and putt around the Batcave

39:04.275 --> 39:05.677
with crusty old Alfred here.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.311
Ah, no, I am no Alfred, sir.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.715
No, you forget.
Alfred had a job.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.916
Willow is not going, either.
I'm doing it alone.

39:11.949 --> 39:15.521
Oh, great. And then when
you have your new no arms,

39:15.554 --> 39:17.523
we can all say,
"Gee, it's a good thing

39:17.556 --> 39:19.356
we weren't there
getting in the way of that."

39:19.391 --> 39:21.092
Right. Maybe we can
help in other ways.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.827
Want some fightin' pants, Buff?

39:22.860 --> 39:24.762
I can get you
some new fightin' pants.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.498
You guys, this isn't helping.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.934
Oh, wow, we're already getting
in the way. We're pretty good

39:28.967 --> 39:30.668
at this, Xander, huh?
Right, I'm so good at it,

39:30.702 --> 39:32.170
you might have to ship me off
to the army

39:32.202 --> 39:33.204
to get me out of the way.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.206
The army?

39:35.239 --> 39:36.942
You didn't know I knew
about that, did you?

39:36.974 --> 39:39.945
You two, talking about me
behind my back.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.713
Us talking about you?

39:41.746 --> 39:44.282
How about you
telling Riley

39:44.315 --> 39:46.384
every last detail
of my life with Angel?

39:46.418 --> 39:48.920
Besides, when is there
any "us two"?

39:48.954 --> 39:51.722
You two are the two
who are the two.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.259
I'm the other one.
Uh-huh, but maybe
that all changes

39:54.291 --> 39:55.793
when I'm doing sit-ups
over at Fort Dix.

39:57.262 --> 39:59.565
Fort Dix? (laughing)

40:01.500 --> 40:03.134
Are you drunk?

40:03.168 --> 40:04.902
Yes. Quite a bit, actually.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.871
Well, stop it.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.273
This is stupid.

40:08.306 --> 40:09.907
Stupid.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.909
So you finally had the guts
to say it to my face.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.579
I didn't say you were stupid.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.079
So stop being an idiot

40:15.112 --> 40:16.782
and let me fix this.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.916
Okay, I need you.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.918
I need both of you,
all the time,

40:20.952 --> 40:22.753
just... not now.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.121
Adam is very
dangerous.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.891
Wait.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.793
How do you need me, really?

40:27.826 --> 40:31.597
You're good with
the computer stuff.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.097
Usually.

40:33.130 --> 40:34.965
And-and there's the witch stuff.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.001
"Witch stuff"?

40:37.034 --> 40:39.605
What exactly do you mean
by "witch stuff"?

40:39.637 --> 40:42.773
You guys, what is happening?
This is crazy.

40:42.807 --> 40:45.409
Oh, no, it's not. It's all
finally making perfect sense,

40:45.443 --> 40:48.813
and I'm not gonna miss
a moment of it.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.748
(arguing voices)

40:50.782 --> 40:53.251
You think this'll
go on for a while?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.552
Hard to say.

40:55.686 --> 40:58.123
(indistinct arguing continues)

40:59.824 --> 41:01.458
Nice bathroom.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.293
Like the tile.

41:03.327 --> 41:05.496
And if I did join the army,
I'd be great. You know why?

41:05.530 --> 41:07.498
Because they might give me a job
that couldn't be done

41:07.532 --> 41:09.034
by any well-trained
Border Collie.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.869
That's it.
I'm going to bed.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.971
No, you'd do wonderful
in the army.

41:13.003 --> 41:14.639
Hey, do you think
the umbilical cord

41:14.672 --> 41:16.807
between you and Anya
could stretch that far?

41:16.842 --> 41:19.244
I knew it. I knew you hated her!

41:21.012 --> 41:23.481
Look, I'm not the one
being judgmental here.

41:23.514 --> 41:25.315
I'll leave that territory
to you and Buffy.

41:25.349 --> 41:26.784
Judgmental?

41:26.818 --> 41:28.152
If I was any
more open-minded

41:28.186 --> 41:29.721
about the choices you two make,

41:29.755 --> 41:31.690
my whole brain would fall out.

41:31.722 --> 41:34.391
Oh, and superior.
Don't forget that.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.726
Just because you're
better than us

41:35.760 --> 41:37.728
doesn't mean you can
be all superior.

41:37.762 --> 41:39.396
You guys, stop this.

41:39.429 --> 41:41.231
What happened
to you today?

41:41.266 --> 41:42.867
It's not today.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.469
Buffy, things have
been wrong for a while.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.704
Don't you see that?

41:46.737 --> 41:49.007
Well, what do you mean, wrong?

41:49.039 --> 41:52.710
Well, they certainly
haven't been right since Tara.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.344
We have to face it...

41:54.378 --> 41:56.414
you can't handle Tara
being my girlfriend.

41:56.447 --> 41:59.050
No! It was bad before that!

41:59.083 --> 42:01.385
Since you two went off to
college and forgot about me.

42:01.418 --> 42:04.355
Just left me in the basement
to... Tara's your girlfriend?

42:04.389 --> 42:06.056
GILES:
Bloody hell.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.326
Enough!

42:08.358 --> 42:10.260
All I know is you want
to help, right?

42:10.295 --> 42:12.362
Be part of the team?

42:12.396 --> 42:14.065
I don't know anymore.
Clearly not wanted.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.266
No! No, you said
you wanted to go.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.036
So let's go,
all of us.

42:18.068 --> 42:21.271
We'll walk into that cave
with you two attacking me

42:21.306 --> 42:23.574
and the funny drunk
drooling on my shoe.

42:23.608 --> 42:25.577
Hey!

42:25.610 --> 42:27.211
Hey, maybe that's the secret way
to killing Adam!

42:27.244 --> 42:28.614
Buffy...

42:28.646 --> 42:29.880
Is that it?

42:29.914 --> 42:33.018
Is that how you can help?

42:33.050 --> 42:35.920
You're not answering me!

42:35.954 --> 42:39.389
How can you possibly help?

42:47.297 --> 42:48.532
So...

42:48.565 --> 42:51.202
I guess

42:51.235 --> 42:53.739
I'm starting to understand
why there's no ancient prophecy

42:53.771 --> 42:56.641
about a chosen one
and her friends.

42:57.675 --> 42:59.077
If I need help,

42:59.110 --> 43:00.577
I'll go to someone
I can count on.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.152
(door opens)

43:10.856 --> 43:12.958
I've been waiting for you.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.527
And now I'm here.

43:57.969 --> 44:00.405
Grr. Argh.
