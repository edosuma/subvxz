WEBVTT

01:46.356 --> 01:47.941
Wanna try 'em on?

01:48.525 --> 01:50.193
I can't afford it.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.196
Becca gave the nod. All yours, no strings.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.490
No thanks.

01:55.573 --> 01:59.953
Didn't bother you
when you put that klepped Sandy on.

02:00.036 --> 02:03.123
Can't scavenge off someone you knew?

02:03.206 --> 02:05.041
They're techie mitts anyways.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.127
You're just being picky.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.504
I have my sights set on something else.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.880
Wha'tcha got your eyes on?

02:12.382 --> 02:14.384
Oh! This?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.845
Bit big for you, ain't it?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.638
I can handle it.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.724
Sure, all yours if I flatline.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.270
Gives you time to bulk up, grow into 'em.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.648
'Kay. Deal.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.735
Ya know, something's different about you…

02:32.819 --> 02:33.653
Huh?

02:34.237 --> 02:37.782
You're usually moping,
bringing the vibe down…

02:37.866 --> 02:39.409
Resident buzzkill.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.453
I'm not!
And I ain't no different from yesterday!

02:42.537 --> 02:43.913
Nah. Something's off.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.124
Ya get laid?

02:47.792 --> 02:48.710
You did.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.672
Gotta work on that poker face, son!

02:52.755 --> 02:55.425
Kiwi! Any progress?

02:55.508 --> 02:57.760
Not at all.

02:59.262 --> 03:03.182
Tanaka's beefed up his defenses
since the last gig.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.853
Tried poking holes around,
but it's been a no-go.

03:06.936 --> 03:11.190
What did I tell ya? We ain't getting
nowhere unless Faraday feeds us something.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.151
Tanaka?

03:13.234 --> 03:15.945
Remember your very first grand theft auto?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.447
He's the owner of the limo.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.199
Problem?

03:20.283 --> 03:21.993
Nah, it's nothing…

03:22.076 --> 03:23.453
Would you look at that.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.955
You were schoolmates with Tanaka's kid.

03:27.540 --> 03:32.670
What?! You accusing our kid of
going to some stuffy corpo school?!

03:32.754 --> 03:36.716
Bona-fide Arasaka Academy dropout.
Straight A student, too.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.718
I'll be damned!

03:38.801 --> 03:43.806
Guess we now know why Gloria was
always strapped on cash.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.477
What's a guy gotta do
to get some privacy around here?

03:48.269 --> 03:53.191
There's not much else I could find on
Tanaka's private file. The rest is trash.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.985
-Like?
-XBDs in his viewing log.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.530
That's good. We can use it for leverage.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.741
A real kinkster. More gore than porn.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.077
Some cyberpsycho shit, too.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.996
The deep, dark fetishes of a suit.

04:08.122 --> 04:11.000
Lots of vids from a gonk who goes by JK.

04:11.084 --> 04:11.918
JK?

04:13.461 --> 04:14.629
Heard of him?

04:14.712 --> 04:19.384
Sure. Jimmy Kurosaki. The braindance
director with a cult following.

04:19.467 --> 04:24.764
He's known for putting up snuff reels
within 24 hours of it happening.

04:24.847 --> 04:29.143
Never seen any director
do the edits that he does.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.021
No wonder he's got so many fans.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.066
Didn't know you were a superfreak.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.025
Uh, well…

04:36.109 --> 04:39.654
Just helped a choom
move his stock, is all.

04:39.737 --> 04:44.325
That's good and all, but do you have
any intel we can actually use?

04:44.409 --> 04:45.618
They're custom-made.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.536
What?

04:47.120 --> 04:51.082
I heard that he sometimes tunes
custom-made footage for VIPs.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.126
You know, like removing pain limiters?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.544
So what?

04:54.627 --> 04:58.881
If he's tuning the footage,
Tanaka's gotta be there as well.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.174
And probably alone.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.051
Alone? How you figure?

05:02.135 --> 05:05.555
Would you bring a bodyguard
to tune up a fetish BD?

05:07.890 --> 05:08.933
Kid's got a point.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.185
Getting sharp, kid!

05:11.269 --> 05:14.355
Now that you're a man now!

05:14.856 --> 05:17.442
What? Did something happen?

05:17.525 --> 05:18.693
Nothing!

05:19.319 --> 05:22.447
Faraday came through
with a lead on Tanaka.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.825
Seems our favorite suit
occasionally ditches his huscle

05:25.908 --> 05:28.077
and usual ride for a Delamain.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.996
Going off-radar, huh?

05:30.079 --> 05:33.791
But Delamain's got him fully covered.
Still can't pinpoint his destination.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.712
I also looked into
the tuning services for BDs.

05:37.795 --> 05:42.300
The main buyers are fat cats,
corpo execs, celebrities, gang bosses…

05:42.383 --> 05:45.053
You get in by referral
and the location is undisclosed.

05:45.136 --> 05:48.264
If we wanna know more,
we'd have to chat with the man himself.

05:48.347 --> 05:49.640
How?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.350
Gotta grab him in person.

05:51.934 --> 05:57.440
Lucky for us, he has a reservation at
Embers tomorrow. He'll be alone.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.358
At a ritzy place like that? Sad.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.862
Great. When he leaves,
let's invite him here for a nightcap.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.281
<i>Let's go.</i>

06:33.726 --> 06:37.522
Hey! You wouldn't happen to be
Jimmy Kurosaki, would you?

06:38.981 --> 06:39.941
Who's asking?

06:40.024 --> 06:42.443
I knew it! I'm a huge fan, sir!

06:42.527 --> 06:46.906
You know a ripperdoc
in Arroyo who pushes XBDs?

06:46.989 --> 06:50.284
I helped him sell your stuff!

06:50.368 --> 06:51.285
Really.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.663
Can I shake your hand?

06:53.746 --> 06:58.668
Oh, sorry… Guess I'm a bit star-struck.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.545
Yeah, I got places to be.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.047
Right… I won't hold you up.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.007
Was an honor meeting you…

07:14.851 --> 07:16.310
What was that?!

07:20.022 --> 07:21.190
Fuck!

07:22.108 --> 07:23.234
What?!

07:23.818 --> 07:25.736
Maine!

07:26.320 --> 07:27.447
Where's David?

07:27.530 --> 07:28.990
Find him!

07:29.073 --> 07:30.616
Snap out of it!

07:35.830 --> 07:37.165
You alright?

07:37.248 --> 07:40.251
Son of a bitch pulled something on us.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.503
What happened?

07:42.587 --> 07:44.338
They're gone.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.256
Gone?

07:45.882 --> 07:48.009
He nabbed David.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.804
Kiwi! You take Maine and head out.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.014
Okay.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.724
I'm fine…

07:54.807 --> 07:56.767
Be a good boy, and stay!

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
Lucy! You're with me.

08:07.653 --> 08:11.324
Got him. Mile and change, straight ahead.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.993
What did that asshole use back there?

08:14.076 --> 08:15.912
Seemed like some kind of EMP.

08:15.995 --> 08:20.833
It got Kiwi real bad.
Only gave me a bit of a shock.

08:20.917 --> 08:26.088
Neural implant targeting.
To neutralize runners, clearly.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.632
You seem okay.

08:27.715 --> 08:28.716
I wasn't in range.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.469
David could be in real shit.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.846
It'll be a problem if he uses that again.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.224
Not if we kill him first.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.227
You're pissed, aren't ya?

08:39.810 --> 08:41.270
A little.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.509
Ah, fuck.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.719
Think it's a cyberpsycho?

09:13.803 --> 09:18.349
No shit, let's head out.
Already hailed MaxTac.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.519
Hey, there's another body.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.022
Don't wander off, man.
What if you run into them?

09:25.606 --> 09:28.067
Don't worry. They're not around anymore.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.529
Hm? Who's there?!

09:31.612 --> 09:32.863
The cyberpsycho!

09:32.947 --> 09:34.031
He's got a gun!

09:34.115 --> 09:35.616
-It wasn't me…
-Drop the gun!

09:35.700 --> 09:36.826
Don't move!

09:36.909 --> 09:39.787
-I woke up and I was just…
-Drop it, you fucking psycho!

09:43.624 --> 09:44.917
Who's there?!

09:45.001 --> 09:46.419
Hey! What happened?!

09:53.009 --> 09:54.594
Got a cyberpsycho!

09:54.677 --> 09:55.636
Raise MaxTac now!

10:15.197 --> 10:16.991
Shots fired back there!

10:17.658 --> 10:19.452
Die, bastard!

10:57.031 --> 10:58.199
MaxTac?!

11:20.471 --> 11:21.722
Fucking monster.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.974
No! It wasn't me!

11:39.448 --> 11:41.075
Awesome, isn't it?

11:41.158 --> 11:44.829
Experiencing your own death
instead of someone else's.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.331
Are you fucking kidding me?!

11:47.915 --> 11:51.752
Awesome? You fucking psychopath…

11:52.795 --> 11:55.714
Hey, I thought you were a fan!

11:55.798 --> 11:58.092
Most of my fans are whack jobs.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.345
You're a cyberpunk, aren't you?

12:01.929 --> 12:03.180
What are you after?

12:03.264 --> 12:05.724
Ambushing me in a place like that…

12:06.434 --> 12:10.604
Clearly, you've done your homework.
Have you seen any of my other works?

12:10.688 --> 12:13.232
The Edgerunner series?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.109
Yeah.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.612
I've seen most of your stuff.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.615
Wow. I'm flattered!

12:23.909 --> 12:29.498
Say, have you ever wondered
where I get those cyberpsycho scrolls?

12:29.582 --> 12:30.791
What?

12:30.875 --> 12:36.755
All military prototypes come with
a built-in braindance scroller.

12:37.339 --> 12:42.011
Some people are willing to
pay through the nose for that kinda stuff.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.267
You know who originally owned this Sandy?

12:48.851 --> 12:53.189
James Norris. How many people
did he kill in the end? 27?

12:53.272 --> 12:56.775
Had a hell of a run-in
with MaxTac in the end.

12:57.443 --> 13:02.907
It's not often you get a guy
who can go toe-to-toe with them.

13:02.990 --> 13:07.620
That was so good…
One of the best I've seen in a while.

13:10.247 --> 13:13.626
I've got high expectations for you, too.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.755
I'm surprised you're still sane
after wearing this.

13:17.838 --> 13:21.383
The side-effects are gonna
drive you mad, eventually.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.844
Can't wait to see it.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.388
I'm not gonna go psycho!

13:26.472 --> 13:30.643
That's what all chromers say.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.896
They think they're all sane
until they aren't.

13:33.979 --> 13:34.897
Not me!

13:34.980 --> 13:36.398
Yes, you.

13:36.982 --> 13:42.154
Another couple rounds with the MaxTac
and your brain'll burst like a balloon.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.743
Wait. You're not gonna
make me go through that again…

13:48.994 --> 13:50.788
Hey, stop!

13:50.871 --> 13:51.914
Cut it out!

13:51.997 --> 13:53.916
Stop!

13:58.587 --> 13:59.463
Don't move!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.469
Put your hands up…

14:06.053 --> 14:07.221
Or you're dead.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.473
You got me!

14:14.395 --> 14:15.229
How's David?

14:15.312 --> 14:17.022
He's in a BD or something.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.983
-Can you get him out?
-I'll try.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.651
Need a hand?

14:20.734 --> 14:21.735
Shut it!

14:21.819 --> 14:23.070
Got it!

14:26.991 --> 14:29.451
David! You alright?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.537
Aw, what a shame.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.999
So? What do you guys want?

14:35.082 --> 14:37.626
I assume you're not here to kill me.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.378
That's still up for jury.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.131
Come on. I'll cooperate.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.757
You catch on quick.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.016
That better not be…

14:53.976 --> 14:55.644
Armed drones!

14:55.728 --> 14:56.645
Bingo!

14:57.396 --> 14:58.439
Call them off!

14:58.522 --> 15:00.232
No can do.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.653
Go on, give 'em a wave.
They're my best toys. Bulletproof and all.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.407
Good luck putting them down
with those tiny little bangers.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.451
I'll blow your brains out first!

15:10.534 --> 15:12.286
Well, that wouldn't be very smart.

15:12.369 --> 15:16.540
That won't stop them from turning you
into a bloodstain on my floor.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.669
Yeah? They won't shoot as long as
I'm using you as a meat-shield.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.508
Knew it was smart to have two.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.551
Shit!

15:28.135 --> 15:30.220
Oh no! Looks like you're surrounded.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.847
Ready to give up?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.140
Shut up!

15:33.223 --> 15:34.058
Lucy!

15:34.141 --> 15:35.809
On it…

15:38.562 --> 15:39.688
I need more time…

15:45.778 --> 15:46.612
David!

15:46.695 --> 15:48.197
I'll distract them!

15:54.161 --> 15:55.329
Hurry it up, Lucy!

16:23.357 --> 16:25.192
Wow! That was impressive!

16:25.275 --> 16:26.902
-Mother…
-Fucker!

16:27.653 --> 16:31.031
White flag! White flag!
Okay, I surrender for real this time!

16:31.115 --> 16:32.825
White flag my ass!

16:32.908 --> 16:35.411
You're already dead, shit stain!

16:35.494 --> 16:38.414
I mean, alright, but I thought
you wanted to ask me things?

16:38.497 --> 16:39.665
God dammit!

16:39.748 --> 16:45.337
Hey girl! Takes real talent
to pull off a hack so quickly.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.925
I'll listen to what you have to say,
but can I get up, please?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.761
No funny business or I'll kill you myself.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.888
I won't. Pinky swear.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.184
Alright. Everyone got the plan?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.603
Aye aye, captain.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.690
I'll call you later.
Until then, stay here.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.485
Keep an eye on him.
Don't let him out of your sight.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.203
Sorry about earlier.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.705
Whatever.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.042
Didn't think you'd agree
to help us so easily.

17:23.542 --> 17:29.423
I know how cyberpunks work.
I don't really have a choice, do I?

17:30.007 --> 17:30.966
Well, yeah.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.053
You've seen that one too?

17:34.136 --> 17:34.970
Yeah.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.931
You saw it
and you still installed the Sandy?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.725
You're one crazy dude.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.478
I won't end up like him.

17:42.561 --> 17:46.356
<i>James Norris was a soldier</i>
<i>who knew his way around implants.</i>

17:46.440 --> 17:49.068
<i>But even he couldn't take it</i>
<i>and went psycho.</i>

17:49.651 --> 17:52.446
<i>What makes you think you're different?</i>

17:53.197 --> 17:56.700
I don't know. It just… feels right.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.828
It's like the implant's
always been a part of me.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.957
I think… I'm built different.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.794
You think you're special?

18:06.877 --> 18:07.711
Sure.

18:10.798 --> 18:14.426
I've seen plenty of chromejocks
go psycho over the years.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.638
Some metal's simply not meant to
mix with meat.

18:17.721 --> 18:23.727
Your organic body, your soul, gets pushed
to the edge. Teeters on the brink.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.730
It always comes down to one of two things.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.233
You either lose your mind…

18:29.817 --> 18:31.985
Or die… No in-between.

18:40.077 --> 18:43.247
We will be arriving
at the destination shortly.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.710
As requested, the record of
your ride today has been expunged.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.963
I look forward to serving you again.

18:53.215 --> 18:57.469
<i>Hey, Mister Tanaka. Come on in.</i>

18:59.263 --> 19:01.431
You're early.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.268
It usually takes months for a new release.

19:04.351 --> 19:08.772
Well, it's difficult finding
good material, you see.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.234
But this next one'll be worth your while.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.279
Would you like to have it
tuned immediately?

19:15.362 --> 19:18.282
My son is being discharged
from the hospital tonight.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.742
I will just be taking the chip.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.036
I see.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.665
That's unfortunate. I'm proud of
how this one turned out.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.793
It'd be a huge waste not to have it tuned.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.045
The sensitivity'd be off the charts.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.547
Mister Kurosaki.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.507
I do not humor slow men.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.301
Unfortunate's one word for it.

19:37.926 --> 19:42.806
Would've made our job a lot easier
if you were in that BD.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.391
Who are you?

19:44.474 --> 19:45.851
Don't try nothing.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.062
The nerve…

19:49.146 --> 19:52.316
Super sorry, sir.
They have me by the balls.

19:52.399 --> 19:55.527
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

19:58.405 --> 20:02.075
Forget about the panic button.
We've got a jammer up.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.830
Just as planned, I see.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.673
Not fucking now!

20:25.974 --> 20:26.934
Maine!

20:30.437 --> 20:31.355
You're…

20:37.653 --> 20:39.821
Pain in my ass.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.080
Must've been the needles.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.331
Got him in the neck.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.874
Shit, he really was slow.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.876
He's suffocating.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.628
Ah… Sucks for him.

20:54.711 --> 20:58.882
Looks like he won't be around
to edit his own death scroll.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.142
Flatlined.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.396
<i>Shit. Trauma Team's coming.</i>

21:12.479 --> 21:15.023
What? This bitch had Trauma coverage?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.776
<i>Yup. Platinum and everything.</i>

21:17.859 --> 21:18.902
Fuck.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.656
Kid, we're getting the hell out!

21:22.739 --> 21:25.409
Now. They find us and we're fucked.
