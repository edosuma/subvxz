00:30.323 --> 00:32.162
That's it.

00:33.025 --> 00:35.065
That's it!

00:38.280 --> 00:41.639
Flamin' wrecking ball's
been going all afternoon!

00:41.640 --> 00:43.759
Just rest for a moment.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.159
The family downstairs have sent more
candles, as well as hot water.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.199
You have good neighbours.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.599
Shame there's hardly any
of them left.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.559
Use all of your strength now, Nola.
Use all of it.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.159
All of it!

01:04.560 --> 01:06.959
Where do we begin?

01:06.960 --> 01:11.439
What marks the start
of any new adventure?

01:11.440 --> 01:13.759
Aren't you the clever one?

01:13.760 --> 01:17.199
You've brought a whole new life
into the world!

01:17.200 --> 01:23.959
Is it the first step? The deep
breath? The single leap of faith?

01:23.960 --> 01:29.239
And what do we leave behind us
when the future calls?

01:29.240 --> 01:32.679
- â™ª East Coast girls are hip... â™ª
- Right, that's it!

01:32.680 --> 01:34.479
No ifs, no buts.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.159
I'm going to take the plunge
with my new electric lady shaver.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.039
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, Trixie?

01:39.040 --> 01:41.359
You could take your whole shin off
if you're not careful.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.159
Even a modest risk to life and limb

01:43.160 --> 01:46.319
is better than blonde hair
poking through one's hosiery.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.919
I sometimes wonder
how we afford hosiery at all!

01:48.920 --> 01:50.999
Tights cost even more
than stockings,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.599
not to mention they ladder
as soon as you look at them.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.319
Maybe we should just wear wool,
like we did in the Outer Hebrides.

01:56.320 --> 02:00.070
Valerie! It's not like you
to be so defeatist.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.079
Another placenta for disposal,

02:08.080 --> 02:10.559
neatly wrapped up
in The Racing Post!

02:10.560 --> 02:12.999
Once, we'd simply burn them
in the bedroom fireplace.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.919
Or sent them down to the allotments,
as tomato food.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.079
We interrupt
the current broadcast

02:18.080 --> 02:20.664
with an important announcement.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.679
Sir Winston Churchill, Britain's
Prime Minister during World War II,

02:24.680 --> 02:29.759
has died at his home in London's
Hyde Park Gate at the age of 90.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.799
- Poor old soul!
- Sir Winston suffered a stroke nine days ago.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.079
The announcement was made
this morning

02:36.080 --> 02:38.439
by Sir Winston's physician,
Lord Moran.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.199
Did you hear that, Nurse Crane?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.959
Her Majesty the Queen and the
Prime Minister have been informed.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.439
Old Winnie! He's finally pegged it!

02:44.440 --> 02:47.039
Couldn't go on beating
the odds forever!

02:47.040 --> 02:48.599
And now the shipping forecast.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.719
It's what came after the war
that really changed society.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.919
And the National Health Service
was nothing to do with Churchill,

02:54.920 --> 02:56.879
or his political party.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.079
Patrick, I think we should leave
politics out of it today.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.914
The man has left a widow
and ten grandchildren!

03:07.960 --> 03:12.159
- There's a carrot here for Flopsy.
- Nothing for poor old Genevieve?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.359
We can't send Flopsy back
to the girls' classroom

03:14.360 --> 03:16.559
looking anything other than
supremely groomed

03:16.560 --> 03:20.679
and well nourished, or they won't be
allowed to bring her home again.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.520
Oh!

03:24.880 --> 03:27.079
- Hello, Tim?
- Hi, Dad.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.159
Listen. The headmaster's cut all
our calls home down to three minutes

03:30.160 --> 03:32.759
because we've got to have
some special assembly

03:32.760 --> 03:34.119
for Winston Churchill.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.439
I think that's very appropriate.
Did you get the cake?

03:36.440 --> 03:38.324
Quick, children,
your brother's on the phone!

03:38.325 --> 03:39.919
I sent you a Dundee
so it would last.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.479
It lasted about five minutes.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.279
Boys in boarding school
get very hungry.

03:43.280 --> 03:46.039
- But I came top in that biology test.
- Come on, May!

03:46.040 --> 03:48.839
- Genevieve!
- Say well done to your brother, children.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.000
Well done, Timothy.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.039
I've no objection to the old war
horse getting a full state funeral.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.159
But if we all go traipsing off
to watch the cortege passing by,

04:02.160 --> 04:05.039
what's going to happen
to our patients?

04:05.040 --> 04:08.319
That was the warden from the
homeless shelter in Rakesby Street.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.359
There's a lady in labour.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.959
She isn't on our books, but things
seem to be moving quickly.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.399
We'll hop in my car and go together.

04:15.400 --> 04:19.279
I've heard unsavoury tales
about that place.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.967
Bed bugs. In the walls.
You can actually hear them.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.439
I've been laying on my back
like a tipped-over tortoise.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.319
I'm scared to move in case
it speeds things up.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.879
Don't you worry now. We'll soon see
how fast you're getting on.

04:45.880 --> 04:50.039
And who's this young man sitting so
politely behind the clothes horse?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.479
It's my Terry.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.599
He don't like missing school,
but he wants to look after me.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.879
We'll take care of your mother now,
Terry.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.119
- You get yourself off to your lessons.
- Can I?

05:00.120 --> 05:01.839
You heard the nurse.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.519
Stopping here ain't going to get
you through the 11-plus

05:04.520 --> 05:07.104
and into grammar school, is it?

05:07.280 --> 05:08.920
No.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.279
Capital of Rhodesia.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.319
Salisbury!

05:14.320 --> 05:17.519
- Closest planet to the Earth.
- Venus!

05:17.520 --> 05:19.639
I bought us a Pears' Cyclopaedia
down the market.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.390
And we go through it every night.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.919
- Good morning.
- What year was this place built?

05:38.920 --> 05:42.799
1860, I believe.
May I ask what you are doing?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.639
Council survey. Slum clearance.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.839
- Are we going inside?
- No need.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.424
They'll be taking it down soon.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.639
In you go, one by one.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.224
Come along, Terry. You're late.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.359
I think we can safely say
it was a false alarm,

06:10.360 --> 06:12.360
and you've weathered it.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.159
But you're registered with us
as of today.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.239
Next time you sense
things are on the move,

06:18.240 --> 06:21.240
we're ready and waiting to help you.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.879
Have you any plans
for moving on from here?

06:25.880 --> 06:29.319
Oh, we've been on the list
for a council flat for seven months.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.119
You see 'em being built all over
the place, but I swear to God,

06:33.120 --> 06:37.120
I don't know how anyone
ever gets to live in 'em.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.980
Seven months! Seven months
living in squalor like that.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.759
Can't you book her
into the maternity home

06:45.760 --> 06:47.559
for a square meal,
a bath and bed rest?

06:47.560 --> 06:49.399
That was my first thought.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.279
But she's no-one to leave
the little lad with,

06:51.280 --> 06:52.639
and he'll end up in foster care.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.140
- The Housing Officer's on the phone.
- Hm.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.239
Yes.

07:02.240 --> 07:07.440
The reference is Mrs Dena Bowland
and her son Terence.

07:09.160 --> 07:13.080
Address - Homeless Unit,
Rakesby Street, Poplar.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.719
An appalling, insanitary facility
over which I imagine

07:17.720 --> 07:21.887
you yourself might claim
some sort of jurisdiction?

07:27.560 --> 07:30.399
Whatever are you doing?
Lunch hour's almost over!

07:30.400 --> 07:33.599
My mother will be looking out for me
on the newsreels of the funeral.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.279
I don't want her to think
I'm looking tired and puffy.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.319
Well, while you two
have been busy preparing

07:40.320 --> 07:42.479
yourselves for the spotlight
of history,

07:42.480 --> 07:47.564
I've found the perfect solution
to our mutual hosiery dilemma!

07:47.800 --> 07:50.479
"How perfect are your pins?

07:50.480 --> 07:53.159
"You can win a year's supply
of Slender Legs tights

07:53.160 --> 07:56.559
"by sending us a snap
of your gorgeous gams.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.239
"Individual and group categories.
Free to enter!"

07:59.240 --> 08:02.319
Well, you're the onewho's been working
overtimewith the lady shave.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.599
I would've thought
you're a shoo-in for first prize.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.559
And I'm not sending pictures
into any magazine, so don't ask me.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.119
Lucille, your ankles are exquisite!

08:11.120 --> 08:13.704
Cyril positively gazes at them!

08:14.480 --> 08:18.159
It isn't an ankle competition.
It's a leg competition.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.879
And legs go all the way up
to other parts of the anatomy.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.759
We've all got biology O-Level,
Lucille.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.359
And we would be in
with a chance of free tights.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.239
Thank you, Valerie.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.574
I'm glad to see somebody's
exhibiting a sense of fun.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.839
One lady due to give birth
moved right up the waiting list

08:36.840 --> 08:39.479
and offered the keys to a flat!

08:39.480 --> 08:44.000
May you be garlanded with laurels!

08:47.440 --> 08:50.799
Oh, Fred! I thought
you were getting the tea ready!

08:50.800 --> 08:54.199
I'll be late for the pest control
sub-committee meeting.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.879
I'm just sorting out my medals
for the big feller's send off.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.879
I haven't decided
what hat to wear yet.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.639
Probably my artificial beaver,

09:01.640 --> 09:06.974
because we shall be stood on that
street for nigh on seven hours!

09:08.160 --> 09:12.327
It's funny what people take
with them when they go.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.600
And what they bring back.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.279
That's a lovely picture of Betty.

09:21.280 --> 09:26.364
- A lovely smile.
- Teeth like that were a rarity, round here.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.200
Bloody Blitz.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.644
I've been thinking
about my Bert, too.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.959
But we've got to think
about what we've got now, Fred.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.520
Life is better than it's ever been.
For everyone.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.600
Let me rub my steam iron
over these ribbons.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.879
Lucille, if your principles,
which I respect,

10:11.880 --> 10:15.199
prevent you from participating as
an individual, why don't you enter

10:15.200 --> 10:19.639
the Wonderful Legs In The Workplace
section with Valerie and I?

10:19.640 --> 10:21.199
What does that entail?

10:21.200 --> 10:25.599
Just us three, posing in our
uniforms, flying the flag for smart,

10:25.600 --> 10:28.959
professional ladies
who need free tights.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.319
It's about esprit de corps, Lucille.

10:31.320 --> 10:35.119
Taking pride in who we are
and what we stand for. Like today!

10:35.120 --> 10:37.199
I'll do it to please you.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.479
Just don't try to persuade me
that it's patriotic.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.814
It's time to see
the long procession.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.239
â™ª To everything
Turn, turn, turn

10:50.240 --> 10:55.359
â™ª There is a season
Turn, turn, turn

10:55.360 --> 10:59.279
â™ª And a time to every purpose

10:59.280 --> 11:02.279
â™ª Under heaven

11:02.280 --> 11:06.199
â™ª A time to be born, a time to die

11:06.200 --> 11:10.239
â™ª A time to plant, a time to reap

11:10.240 --> 11:13.679
â™ª A time to kill, a time to heal

11:13.680 --> 11:18.239
â™ª A time to laugh,
a time to weep... â™ª

11:18.240 --> 11:20.239
Three, two, one!

11:20.240 --> 11:23.439
- That's it! What's next?
- Instruments. Cheese!

11:23.440 --> 11:27.039
â™ª To everything
Turn, turn, turn

11:27.040 --> 11:30.919
â™ª There is a season
Turn, turn, turn

11:30.920 --> 11:35.479
â™ª And a time to every purpose... â™ª

11:35.480 --> 11:37.920
The power's gone off.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.999
All right, Sister.
Try flicking the switch again.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.840
- Oh!
- Eh!

11:54.000 --> 11:56.240
Goodnight.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.080
Oh!

12:22.520 --> 12:24.280
Oh, no!

12:25.680 --> 12:27.880
Oh, no, no, no!

12:30.280 --> 12:33.159
It's all right, little one.
I've gotcha.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.320
I've gotcha!

12:41.400 --> 12:44.359
Her temperature's improved.

12:44.360 --> 12:48.399
And I think she has been fed
not long before she was abandoned.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.959
She vomited quite a bit of milk.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.839
Looking at the cord,
she's more than 24 hours old.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.199
Although I don't know
what it was tied with.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.759
It looks like purple sewing thread.

13:00.760 --> 13:06.159
Not a hospital deliver and not
done by a professional either.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.494
I feel as sorry for the mother
as I do for the child.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.360
Sergeant Woolf's here.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.600
Here we go. Come on.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.319
A little bit higher.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.159
Every London hospital has been asked
to be on the alert for anyone

13:27.160 --> 13:30.119
arriving in casualty
with post-birth complications

13:30.120 --> 13:32.479
and no appropriate referral.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.279
I don't want anything going into
the press that would make the mother

13:35.280 --> 13:38.530
too scared to seek help
if she needs it.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.759
Dr Turner wants her to go
to St Cuthbert's,

13:42.760 --> 13:47.427
in case she picked up
an infection from lying in the bin.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.120
Oh. Poor little scrap.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.240
Can I hold her?

13:59.840 --> 14:03.759
I told them I wanted to give her
a name before she goes,

14:03.760 --> 14:06.200
Sergeant Woolf said I could.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.564
But then I couldn't think
of anything.

14:13.440 --> 14:19.240
How about Primrose? They're little
flowers that turn up in the cold.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.199
We will have to ensure a Scotch egg
is despatched to Sister Frances.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.519
I offered to go and relieve her,
but she's adamant she's staying

14:31.520 --> 14:35.319
with the baby until they take her
to St Cuthbert's.

14:35.320 --> 14:39.319
I imagine she's become
emotionally involved.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.559
It happened all the time with people

14:42.560 --> 14:46.039
stumbling across babies
in Hong Kong.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.559
Abandonment's very rare in Poplar.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.239
It's only the second case
I've ever heard of.

14:51.240 --> 14:57.639
Once, infants such as these would
not even have been found alive.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.239
Mudlarks would recover them,

15:00.240 --> 15:03.907
naked and dead on the shoreline
of the river.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.880
I'll go.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.919
Maybe times have improved.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.039
No matter how poor people are,
they always find a way.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.759
The relinquishment of a child
has little to do with poverty

15:18.760 --> 15:21.920
and much to do with desperation.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.519
Oh, sorry, Valerie.
Were you putting your feet up?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.439
No, Maureen.
I was having my lunch.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.279
And I'm on my way back from my
cleaning shift, at the Black Sail.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.239
- Helping Auntie Flo out. Remember her?
- Yes. I do.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.479
Well, that's funny, cos you seem to
have forgotten who your grandma is!

15:38.480 --> 15:40.799
Not to mention where she is!

15:40.800 --> 15:42.559
Holloway?

15:42.560 --> 15:43.959
Why don't you shout a bit louder,

15:43.960 --> 15:46.319
and throw the "abortion" word
in while you're about it?

15:46.320 --> 15:50.079
Ashamed, are you? Because I'm not.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.239
I went to visit her in prison
yesterday, with Flo,

15:53.240 --> 15:56.039
which is more than you have,
according to her.

15:56.040 --> 16:00.790
She cried like a tap all
through my visit. Because of you.

16:02.840 --> 16:07.400
- Does she blame me, Maureen?
- No.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.959
She just misses you.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.159
She kept talking about
when we were all kids,

16:13.160 --> 16:16.639
and how she had us tucked under
that scratchy tartan blanket

16:16.640 --> 16:19.974
down Bethnal Green Tube
in the air raids.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.227
- Seems a long time ago now.
- Don't it just?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.319
We have to let her go.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.479
We've got to have faith
in her future.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.600
How can we have faith in her future?

16:52.760 --> 16:57.760
All we know about her past
is that she wasn't wanted.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.679
Will you hurry up in there?

17:10.680 --> 17:13.039
You'll wash that face off
if you carry on scrubbing!

17:13.040 --> 17:16.319
I was doing my teeth again!

17:16.319 --> 17:19.569
Have I got a Colgate ring
of confidence?

17:20.200 --> 17:24.878
Oh, not half!
Oh, you smell beautiful.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.319
Tomorrow, I've got vouchers
to go down to the charity office

17:28.319 --> 17:32.319
and get us the things we need
for the flat, and for the baby.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.570
We're even in with
the chance of a pram.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.599
Mum.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.679
When the baby's born,
will we be a family?

17:40.680 --> 17:43.159
We're a family now, Terry.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.439
And will it look like me?

17:45.440 --> 17:49.200
No, son. More like me.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.559
Good evening!
I'm afraid the surgery's closed.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.119
I'm sorry. I just wanted to leave
something for the abandoned baby.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.639
The one they're calling
Primrose in the papers.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.559
- That's ever so kind of you.
- It's only a matinee jacket.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.919
In yellow, because of her name.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.919
I felt proper sorry for her,
wrapped up in someone's nightie.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.839
I'll make sure it gets sent
to her at St Cuthbert's.

18:22.840 --> 18:27.174
Why's she at St Cuthbert's?
Papers said she was here.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.439
Dr Turner's surgery.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.159
I'm sorry. We're not allowed
to talk to journalists.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.239
I'll take it there myself.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.079
You're meant to ring the police up.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.664
I don't want to be rude,
but I'm putting the phone down.

18:48.800 --> 18:54.320
Hello? Miss? Hello?

18:57.960 --> 19:00.879
It's not uncommon for cranks
to come forward

19:00.880 --> 19:03.319
in cases like this, Sister Frances.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.799
They can be as disturbed as the
person who abandoned the infant,

19:06.800 --> 19:09.399
yet not have any connection
to the child at all.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.759
This woman was lactating.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.677
I saw the stains on her blouse
with my own eyes.

19:16.680 --> 19:23.119
And she knew that Primrose had been
wrapped in a woman's nightdress.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.454
That detail wasn't
in a single newspaper.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.599
If you could spell "lactating"
for me, I'd be obliged.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.799
I'm running a lot of mauves
at the moment

19:34.800 --> 19:36.599
because purple's all the rage -

19:36.600 --> 19:40.267
everything from lavender
through to amethyst.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.799
This colour is very close.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.999
Do you think it might have been
purchased here?

19:46.000 --> 19:50.319
Oh, no. Because it's pure silk!
Absolutely top notch.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.239
I got something similar in,
in ivory,

19:53.240 --> 19:56.159
when Sister Julienne was mending
the Easter altar cloth.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.519
But that was a special order.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.480
Thank you.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.560
Oh! Ah!

20:09.080 --> 20:12.199
These sums come up
on the 11-plus paper every year.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.879
So we're going to work on them
every day this week.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.759
Sorry to disturb.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.079
I'm just rounding up some stragglers
for the TB testing programme.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.479
A little bird tells me
Sufiyah Ahmad's in this class?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.359
We haven't seen her
for a fortnight, Sister.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.199
- I think the family might've moved on.
- Oh, well.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.679
Not for the want of trying! Sorry.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.320
Terry! Pay attention, please!

20:38.200 --> 20:40.480
Ow! Ow!

20:47.800 --> 20:51.960
Ah! Ow!

21:00.120 --> 21:02.320
Mum.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.400
Mum.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.239
Ah. Do you think
it's another false alarm?

21:25.240 --> 21:28.119
No, precious.
I think you're six fingers dilated.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.719
But it's not convenient.
I need to get home!

21:30.720 --> 21:34.159
You're staying right where you are.
We'll get a message to Terry.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.439
- How?
- Miss Higgins, the secretary, will help.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.920
Argh!

21:46.080 --> 21:48.639
But Terry needs me to help him
with his homework.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.039
It's time you stopped fretting
about everybody and everything.

21:53.040 --> 21:56.039
The next few hours are just
about you and your baby.

21:56.040 --> 22:00.374
I'll do any fretting
that's required. Do you hear me?

22:04.240 --> 22:09.990
Let's get you back up on the bed,
so I can see how you're progressing.

22:11.960 --> 22:15.479
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.839
You don't need to be sopping wet,
you've got work to do!

22:17.840 --> 22:22.257
And you're planning a nice
leisurely evening, are you?

22:24.960 --> 22:29.710
Just move your legs apart for me,
heels up to your bottom.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.319
What's the matter?

22:36.320 --> 22:39.559
- Is there something wrong?
- Everything is going to be just perfect.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.560
But we need a little change of plan.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.090
Did Miss Higgins see Terry?

22:51.720 --> 22:54.959
- I want to push!
- Not yet, precious. Not yet.

22:54.960 --> 22:59.079
- Just pant, Dena.
- Mrs Bowland, what a nice surprise!

22:59.080 --> 23:02.799
I was hoping I'd get to see you
on the big day.

23:02.800 --> 23:06.519
- How might I be of assistance?
- We have a cord prolapse.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.319
Mother is fully dilated
and feeling the urge to push.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.679
What's a prolapse?

23:10.680 --> 23:13.839
It means the cord's been born
in advance of baby.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.879
Best thing we can do
is turn you over

23:15.880 --> 23:18.439
and get you with your knees
up to your chest.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.879
What? No. No. I can't.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.919
- I can't!
- You're already doing it, Dena.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.920
That's it lass! That's it.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.919
- Now tuck your knees right under.
- Argh!

23:30.920 --> 23:35.837
It might feel ungainly,
but that's exactly where we want it.

23:38.920 --> 23:43.479
Push, Dena! The harder you push,
the quicker it will come!

23:43.480 --> 23:47.647
- And the better that's going to be for baby!
- Ow!

23:50.280 --> 23:53.199
Mum? Argh!

23:53.200 --> 23:55.279
We want you to keep pushing
and pushing.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.239
We need this baby to be born.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.719
But I thought I was supposed to push
when I had a contraction.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.119
Remember what I said
about I do all the fretting?

24:02.120 --> 24:04.039
- I do all the giving orders, too.
- Come on.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.040
You grab my hand and do as she says.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.799
No sound this time.

24:09.800 --> 24:15.359
All that energy, you force it
right down, down through your body

24:15.360 --> 24:18.999
while you push, and you push,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.399
and you push that baby out.

24:22.400 --> 24:27.067
- Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming.
- Raah!

24:28.440 --> 24:31.920
Well done!

24:45.560 --> 24:48.310
Listen to him.
Just listen to him!

24:49.480 --> 24:51.897
He sounds just like my Terry.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.320
Mum?

25:06.120 --> 25:08.160
Terry!

25:11.480 --> 25:13.999
Terry?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.559
Terry! Open your eyes, dear.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.644
Terry. I'm fetching help.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.999
You certainly got your reward,
for all your hard work.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.319
It was hard. And it was work.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.600
But it wasn't hard work.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.240
Now open as wide as you can, son.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.319
I can't quite believe
what I'm seeing here.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.404
Or maybe I don't want to.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.879
Can you let me have another look?

26:11.880 --> 26:14.359
See that?

26:14.360 --> 26:17.319
That grey membrane
stretching across his throat?

26:17.320 --> 26:19.279
- It's diphtheria?
- Yes.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.399
This day and age?

26:21.400 --> 26:23.479
I'm giving him penicillin now.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.759
Then we need to get him
to St Cuthbert's.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.120
And the isolation ward.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.719
I'll inform the medical officer
first thing in the morning.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.759
It's also imperative

26:36.760 --> 26:39.359
that everyone who's been in contact
with him is tested.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.360
Every family member.
Every classmate.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.319
I've already swabbed his mother.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.559
She gave birth just hours ago.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.159
Shouldn't Terry
have been vaccinated?

26:50.160 --> 26:54.244
He's ten. It's possible he was,
and it's worn off.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.919
But from his records,
his early life with his mother

26:57.920 --> 27:00.337
was chaotic to say the least.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.519
We're all meant to be
travelling forwards.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.319
Everything's supposed to be
improving, all the time.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.904
Diphtheria making a comeback
isn't progress.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.440
It's medieval.

27:17.800 --> 27:21.439
As nursing professionals,
you have a duty to make sure

27:21.440 --> 27:25.119
you are up-to-date
with all vaccinations and boosters.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.839
Sorry, Nurse Crane.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.959
You need to set a good example
to all your patients,

27:29.960 --> 27:31.719
particularly the mothers.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.119
If you could remember
what I can remember,

27:34.120 --> 27:36.479
you wouldn't have shilly-shallied.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.230
Sleeve up. I haven't got all day.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.999
Ian Halkins, Class Four?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.799
Sweetie from the basket
and go straight home.

27:50.800 --> 27:55.217
Teacher has a letter
for your mother about quarantine.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.359
Nonnatus House.
Midwife speaking.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.439
We've just been called upon
to remove a distressed lady

28:02.440 --> 28:05.399
from St Cuthbert's
maternity ward.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.839
She claims to be
Baby Primrose's mother

28:08.840 --> 28:14.319
but otherwise refuses to give her
name or identify herself in any way.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.519
Have you taken her into custody?

28:16.520 --> 28:19.520
I'd prefer to say she's in our care.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.439
Have you brought her?
Have you brought my baby?

28:31.440 --> 28:32.879
Not this time, sweetie.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.214
But the policeman said
you were midwives.

28:37.320 --> 28:40.319
We are midwives.

28:40.320 --> 28:44.199
And we're also nurses,
and we're your friends.

28:44.200 --> 28:50.200
While we're looking after you, we'll
be whichever of those you need most.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.159
Sh.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.079
But I've been holding him.
I've been feeding him.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.519
You tested positive
for diphtheria bacterium.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.319
Until the antibiotics gets to work,

29:06.320 --> 29:08.119
it's wise to keep him
in the nursery.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.719
If I can't go to him,
can I go to Terry?

29:10.720 --> 29:15.554
Terry's being very well looked
after in the isolation ward.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.519
What are you trying to say, Terry?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.559
Next week.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.319
What's next week?

29:35.320 --> 29:37.720
11-plus.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.279
Good morning, Nurse Crane.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.479
I'm pleased to announce

29:51.480 --> 29:53.679
all recommended precautions
are in place.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.079
That's scant consolation to the
mothers expecting to deliver here.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.279
I've a list of nine whose due dates
fall within the next two weeks.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.279
And I have a list
of alternative facilities.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.159
Please, somebody help me
with my niece?

30:06.160 --> 30:09.660
Miss Higgins.
Will you please fetch Doctor?

30:15.120 --> 30:17.840
Oh, no. I recognise that smell.

30:22.520 --> 30:26.999
There's a lot we can tell you
about your situation.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.399
You have sustained a small tear,
which will mend on its own.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.879
And your breasts are leaking milk

30:33.880 --> 30:38.714
because your body is weeping
for a reunion with your child.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.639
If, in return, you could tell us
a little about yourself,

30:42.640 --> 30:48.119
even just your name, it would be so
much the better for all concerned.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.399
I can't tell... you.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.279
And why is that?

30:52.280 --> 30:54.279
Because I've done wrong.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.030
And you're a woman of the church.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.999
I'm not. Note - red hat, no wimple.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.719
I've some sanitary towels
and some antiseptic in my bag.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.679
The ladies' isn't too dreadful,

31:07.680 --> 31:12.014
so I suggest we pop along
and you can have a tidy-up.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.879
Diphtheria?
People die of diphtheria.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.959
Open wide, please.

31:19.960 --> 31:23.919
Any details you can give us
about Carole's work,

31:23.920 --> 31:27.359
who she mixes with in her spare
time, would be so helpful.

31:27.360 --> 31:33.119
A week or so ago, she rang me,
crying, begging for help.

31:33.120 --> 31:37.620
She was living in a homeless shelter
in Rakesby Street.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.399
I don't know about you,
Sister Hilda,

31:43.400 --> 31:45.839
but I'm seeing nothing untoward
with the naked eye.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.719
The trouble is, half the people
that were here with Terry Bowland

31:48.720 --> 31:50.959
and Carole Witley have moved on.

31:50.960 --> 31:54.239
Any one of them
could've been the source.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.079
Better?

31:56.080 --> 31:58.199
There's nothing worse
than feeling un-fresh

31:58.200 --> 32:01.450
and not having
the necessaries with you!

32:04.320 --> 32:08.680
It's all right, sweetie.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.440
Come on.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.697
You've been so alone in this,
haven't you?

32:22.120 --> 32:25.204
Were you alone
when the baby was born?

32:26.800 --> 32:30.134
I didn't know
how it was going to happen.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.599
I knew it had started.
I knew it would hurt.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.599
I just kept wanting to crouch down,
as if I was an animal.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.599
Did nobody hear you at all?
Did no-one come?

32:40.600 --> 32:44.959
I had my cardigan sleeve
in my mouth to stop me screaming.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.999
- I didn't want anyone to know.
- And what do you want now?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.840
Her.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.174
You need to help us
to help you, sweetie.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.680
Will you help me?

33:01.200 --> 33:05.200
Will you help me
if I tell you my name is Brenda?

33:05.520 --> 33:08.799
Brenda. Primrose is waiting for you.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.634
And the police need your name
and your address.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.879
Brenda Donnelly.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.200
St Genistus' presbytery.
Sarum Street.

33:21.880 --> 33:24.297
I'm the priest's housekeeper.

33:45.160 --> 33:49.439
Ah, to what do I owe the pleasure,
Sister?

33:49.440 --> 33:54.320
Mother. Mildred,
of the Order of St Raymond Nonnatus.

33:55.320 --> 33:59.439
Mrs Donnelly has been following
her usual routines.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.439
I had no knowledge of her situation.
None at all.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.319
She lives under your roof.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.479
Her accommodation
is behind the kitchen.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.759
Meaning that you never go there?

34:08.760 --> 34:11.958
Meaning strict boundaries
are observed.

34:11.960 --> 34:15.998
Up until two months ago,
she had a bedsit in the next street.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.799
But the building was condemned

34:17.800 --> 34:20.599
and so we offered her a home here,
out of charity.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.319
- And expediency, no doubt.
- Father Morris is elderly.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.559
He's confined to his room,

34:25.560 --> 34:27.639
and without going
into indelicate detail,

34:27.639 --> 34:32.224
it does put a certain amount
of pressure on the laundry.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.478
- Is she well?
- She is in distress.

34:39.480 --> 34:43.518
- As you might imagine.
- And the infant?

34:43.520 --> 34:48.320
Primrose has as yet to be
reunited with her mother.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.399
Perhaps continued separation
would be best for all concerned

34:52.400 --> 34:54.199
if adoption is planned.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.599
Is adoption planned?

34:56.600 --> 34:58.319
Obviously.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.999
She cannot keep the child.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.879
She fears she cannot keep the child.

35:02.880 --> 35:07.279
I suspect her desires conflict
with what she thinks is possible.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.839
You just informed me
she placed her in a dustbin.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.159
Brenda is a broken woman,
Father Duncombe.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.559
She's always been a broken woman.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.919
She had a history of mental illness
before she came to us.

35:15.920 --> 35:19.504
That does not mean
she is devoid of feeling.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.320
I venture to say
that it means the reverse!

35:38.480 --> 35:41.239
Is this Mrs Donnelly's
sewing basket?

35:41.240 --> 35:44.239
I believe it is. Yes.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.519
She always had
a lot of mending on the go.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.759
Shirts, vestments and so forth.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.640
So, did she come to your personal
study to do that, Father?

35:58.360 --> 35:59.880
On occasion.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.684
Now, go and give Genevieve
her dinner.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.879
What are you doing?

36:12.880 --> 36:15.439
Sponging and pressing
Timothy's old blazer.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.079
It looked unloved,
just hanging there.

36:18.080 --> 36:22.119
And it smells of his chemistry set
and Clearasil.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.599
I miss him, too.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.479
What? What's the matter?

36:27.480 --> 36:31.760
- Come here.
- Which one of you's hurt? Go on.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.879
Go inside, children,
and wash your hands.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.559
In a minute, you're going
to hear some lovely news.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.719
The rabbit's had...

36:48.720 --> 36:50.279
...more rabbits.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.639
I thought Flopsy was female.

36:52.640 --> 36:55.519
We all thought Flopsy was female.

36:55.520 --> 36:59.479
They've got no fur,
and they look like animated giblets.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.559
No wonder the girls are traumatised.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.919
I think baby rabbits
are actually called kittens.

37:03.920 --> 37:07.837
Patrick. This is going to be
educational enough.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.320
Thank you.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.679
Do I just, erm, pick her up?
Am I allowed?

37:29.680 --> 37:32.014
She's your daughter, Brenda.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.159
I'm sorry.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.439
I'm so sorry.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.399
For what I did.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.319
For what I didn't do.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.904
For what I wanted.
For what I couldn't have.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.039
I'm sorry.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.540
And I'm not sorry.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.560
Not if I die and burn.

38:19.120 --> 38:22.000
Sh...

38:28.840 --> 38:30.839
She says she wants to feed the baby,

38:30.840 --> 38:33.439
but she's so engorged,
it's going to be impossible.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.999
It might be too soon for the
breast pump, but it's worth a try.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.119
We must take
every conceivable measure

38:40.120 --> 38:42.679
to head off mastitis at the pass.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.999
The hospital says
that they won't release Primrose

38:45.000 --> 38:46.799
until Social Services are satisfied.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.599
And then they say there's no bed
for Brenda because she isn't ill.

38:49.600 --> 38:54.239
If the authorities agree, we'll find
a room for her at Nonnatus House.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.599
Ah! Father Duncombe.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.559
I telephoned the ward and asked
if I might see the child.

38:59.560 --> 39:04.119
Mrs Donnelly is with her daughter.
Is she expecting you?

39:04.120 --> 39:06.400
She is not.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.799
The Medical Officer telephoned.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.479
Three more cases of confirmed
diphtheria in the wider borough.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.159
Are the swab results
from Rakesby Street back yet?

39:15.160 --> 39:16.919
No-one appears
to have active disease.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.239
But two adults
and four children have tested

39:19.240 --> 39:22.719
positive for diphtheria bacteria
in the upper respiratory tract.

39:22.720 --> 39:27.304
Someone's infected them. Recently.
That much is certain.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.839
I don't doubt that you want what's
best for your daughter, Brenda.

39:42.840 --> 39:47.319
And that's why I came here today,
to baptise her.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.999
- As a Catholic?
- Of course as a Catholic.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.279
She will not be denied
the Sacrament.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.079
You're too late.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.319
I christened her myself.
A nun told me anyone can do that,

39:58.320 --> 40:01.154
when I was at the children's home.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.879
You must have been
very afraid for Primrose.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.380
I was afraid she'd die
if nobody found her.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.839
Perhaps Brenda might feel
more at ease if you left us alone.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.599
And I would feel more at ease
if I remain.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.959
This lady requires support.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.320
I can't disagree with that.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.880
You need support, don't you, Brenda?

40:30.560 --> 40:34.839
You need to know that your daughter
is safe and well looked after.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.039
You need to know
that she's with someone

40:37.040 --> 40:40.374
who can give her
the care that she needs.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.360
And you can't do that.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.567
With the best will in the world,
you can't do that.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.839
I know I can't.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.519
I've already spoken
with two adoption societies.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.359
Both have offered you assistance.

40:55.360 --> 40:58.559
I am terminating
this conversation forthwith.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.959
The only ASSISTANCE

41:00.960 --> 41:03.119
this baby's mother
currently requires

41:03.120 --> 41:05.279
is of a personal nature.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.879
And Nurse Franklin
is poised to supply it.

41:07.880 --> 41:11.964
- Brenda.
- The breast pump. If you'll be so kind.

41:17.680 --> 41:22.930
Colour film doesn't half make
Reggie's hair look red! Bless him.

41:24.920 --> 41:26.080
Well...

41:27.760 --> 41:31.344
I won't be putting this on display.

41:34.040 --> 41:39.520
In the tin, yeah, with the things
I don't want to forget.

41:41.640 --> 41:45.839
But I will always remember
lifting that bin lid

41:45.840 --> 41:47.924
and seeing Baby Primrose.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.560
Picture or no picture.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.839
These sheets are that smooth,

42:26.840 --> 42:28.959
they're like icing
on a wedding cake.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.479
Clean every day. Shouldn't think
you'd even get that in the Ritz.

42:32.480 --> 42:37.159
What I don't like about this bed
is the space around it.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.077
Or the space around me.

42:40.400 --> 42:44.439
I normally have my Terry
cuddled up across the mattress...

42:44.440 --> 42:47.107
...and I can hear him breathing.

42:47.400 --> 42:52.734
And it's like when I was a kid,
and I bunked in with my brothers.

42:53.720 --> 42:57.637
And that's what family meant.
It meant no space.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.000
No silence.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.254
No being lonely in the dark.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.360
I remember that.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.479
Once we've measured you up
for a more suitable brassiere,

43:20.480 --> 43:24.559
we're going to put these delightful
cold compresses on your bosoms.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.119
Will that help me to feed her?

43:26.120 --> 43:28.159
It will make you
much more comfortable.

43:28.160 --> 43:30.359
And everything else
we can work out together.

43:30.360 --> 43:36.277
I've got so much to make up to her.
There's so much I need to get right.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.439
Brenda.

43:39.440 --> 43:42.319
You are more than capable of being
an excellent mother to Primrose.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.399
And anyone who tells you otherwise
is simply out to bully you.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.839
I do wrong things, Nurse.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.279
I go in wrong directions.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.919
I've fallen into sin,
and I can't climb out of it.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.670
Let's work out what size you are.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.999
I've not told you the truth.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.239
You're free to tell me
anything that you want to

44:00.240 --> 44:03.240
or keep any secret that you wish to.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.039
I tell people I'm a widow.

44:06.040 --> 44:10.239
I'm not. I'm divorced.

44:10.240 --> 44:13.320
Be that as it may, it's not a crime.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.759
Who did this, Brenda?

44:24.760 --> 44:27.319
My husband. With his belt.

44:27.320 --> 44:31.039
The leather just made stripe marks,
and they faded, over the years.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.319
The buckle cut in more.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.800
I'm sorry.

44:41.120 --> 44:43.519
Married straight from the orphanage.

44:43.520 --> 44:46.000
It seemed the best way out.

44:47.040 --> 44:50.399
When I was eight,
me mam took me to the nuns

44:50.400 --> 44:54.119
and asked them to have me
because she was dying.

44:54.120 --> 44:58.999
On the way, she went into a cake
shop and bought us two eclairs.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.399
We sat on a wall and ate them.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.734
Pretended we were in a cafe.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.639
There were times when I was married,
I'd look back and think,

45:08.640 --> 45:13.640
"Sitting on that wall
was the last time I was happy."

45:16.200 --> 45:18.617
But I can't have been, can I?

45:19.720 --> 45:22.199
You were a child, Brenda.

45:22.200 --> 45:26.639
And children are alert
to any joy that comes their way...

45:26.640 --> 45:30.390
...any smile that's tossed
in their direction.

45:31.760 --> 45:35.344
Some of us carry that with us
all our lives.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.450
I want better for Primrose.

45:41.080 --> 45:45.080
The people who smile at her
are going to mean it.

45:52.080 --> 45:53.879
I came to offer help.

45:53.880 --> 45:56.159
You came to arrange an adoption.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.719
That's not the kind of help
Mrs Donnelly requires.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.599
She wants to keep the baby.

46:01.600 --> 46:06.599
- Her decision is therefore final.
- Not necessarily.

46:06.600 --> 46:10.719
Social Services will scrutinise
her mental health.

46:10.720 --> 46:15.199
And as of this week,
she is unemployed.

46:15.200 --> 46:18.039
Is Mrs Donnelly aware of that fact?

46:18.040 --> 46:19.519
With an illegitimate baby in tow,

46:19.520 --> 46:24.439
she is not morally suitable for the
position of Presbytery housekeeper.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.999
Should she choose to return
without the baby,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.599
the situation might be different.

46:29.600 --> 46:33.159
She has said
she will not give up her baby.

46:33.160 --> 46:34.839
That is her right.

46:34.840 --> 46:39.639
The father will have rights too,
if he is legally identified.

46:39.640 --> 46:43.799
Oops.

46:43.800 --> 46:47.919
Apologies. I'm just popping over
to the school with my shark net.

46:47.920 --> 46:49.919
The Class Four teacher called
and said

46:49.920 --> 46:53.119
one of my Mantoux test candidates
has put in an appearance.

46:53.120 --> 46:56.679
She didn't know the class
had been quarantined, poor pet.

46:56.680 --> 46:58.560
Sorry.

47:06.040 --> 47:09.759
Do you know who the father is,
Father?

47:09.760 --> 47:12.840
No, Mother. I do not.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.599
And that's that!

47:17.600 --> 47:21.039
You are a frightfully brave
young lady.

47:21.040 --> 47:23.959
Could you have a look at Sufiyah's
other arm while you're here, Sister?

47:23.960 --> 47:26.544
What's the matter with her arm?

47:35.000 --> 47:38.834
- Oh, good Lord.
- She told me it doesn't hurt.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.679
I've never seen anything like that!

47:41.680 --> 47:43.719
It started as an insect bite.

47:43.720 --> 47:47.470
She says she had it
before they left Pakistan.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.640
Let me see.

47:59.480 --> 48:01.840
You have dark hair.

48:03.480 --> 48:06.039
I've spoken to the school secretary.

48:06.040 --> 48:07.359
The address the Ahmads gave

48:07.360 --> 48:09.999
when they enrolled was
Rakesby Street Homeless Unit.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.839
They've managed to move in
with relatives since then.

48:12.840 --> 48:16.919
That filthy wound is almost
certainly cutaneous diphtheria.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.759
The bacteria has been
constantly shedding

48:19.760 --> 48:21.679
and spreading everywhere she's been.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.919
It can live in floor dust
for 14 weeks.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.519
No. I'm calling
the Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

48:27.520 --> 48:31.359
And the council.
I want Rakesby Street fumigated.

48:31.360 --> 48:33.359
And this surgery deep cleaned.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.694
As soon as the poor little girl
has gone.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.559
Brenda, my dear.

48:44.560 --> 48:48.399
You must think exceptionally
carefully about naming

48:48.400 --> 48:51.039
the father on the birth certificate.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.919
If I don't, I'll look like a slut.

48:52.920 --> 48:57.479
And if you do name him, he'll have
the right to influence her fate,

48:57.480 --> 49:01.897
the right to fight you
if you make a different choice.

49:23.600 --> 49:27.039
- I need to see the doctor.
- Maureen? What's wrong?

49:27.040 --> 49:29.359
I reckon my kids
have got diphtheria.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.839
Maxine's throat is so sore
she can hardly swallow,

49:31.840 --> 49:35.257
- and Gary's not much better.
- All right.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.760
Open wide.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.239
German measles.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.879
Hence the rash
and the inflamed throats.

49:49.880 --> 49:52.279
- Do they need penicillin?
- No.

49:52.280 --> 49:55.159
Just a couple of days in front
of the television, hot drinks

49:55.160 --> 49:57.959
and aspirin if they run a fever.

49:57.960 --> 50:01.240
With a lollipop
to take the taste away.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.759
I'll go and see what we've got.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.879
Thanks, Val.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.919
I spoke out of turn last week...

50:10.920 --> 50:14.999
...about you and your gran.
I'm sorry.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.919
I'm sorry. And I'm grateful.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.479
I was, erm, running away
from something that was hard.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.879
And it was too easy.

50:23.880 --> 50:27.039
Till I opened my ruddy trap.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.119
I'm grateful.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.287
And I'm going to go
and see my grandma.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.959
I'm getting better, Mum.
They're going to let me out soon!

50:46.960 --> 50:49.599
Me too, sweetheart.
And your baby brother.

50:49.600 --> 50:53.434
They're going to let me do
the 11-plus at home.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.040
Pray be seated.

50:56.440 --> 50:59.279
Pass the teacakes
to this end of the table.

50:59.280 --> 51:03.114
There's a draft down there
and they'll go cold.

51:09.920 --> 51:14.504
I will be returning
to the Mother House within the week.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.480
You'll be greatly missed.

51:19.040 --> 51:23.399
I shall be taking Brenda Donnelly
and her daughter with me.

51:23.400 --> 51:27.159
To the Mother House?
Or the Orphanage?

51:27.160 --> 51:28.999
Both, in essence.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.319
We will be, for her,
whatever she requires.

51:32.320 --> 51:36.237
One does not have to be a child
to be an orphan.

51:41.040 --> 51:44.519
Carole Witley has been discharged
from the isolation ward,

51:44.520 --> 51:46.999
but there's no need
for any district visits,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.799
we found her a bed
in the convalescent place at Hythe.

51:49.800 --> 51:54.279
Meanwhile, little Sufiyah Ahmad
is going home, but she'll need

51:54.280 --> 51:57.719
daily dressing changes
on that ulcer for some weeks.

51:57.720 --> 52:00.000
Of course, poor pet.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.879
Nurse Franklin. Good of you
to bestow the gift

52:03.880 --> 52:05.199
of your presence upon us.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.160
I was detained by the postman!

52:10.200 --> 52:12.399
"I am delighted to inform you,
and your colleagues

52:12.400 --> 52:14.599
"that you have been declared
runners-up

52:14.600 --> 52:17.119
"in the Slender Legs
professional section!"

52:17.120 --> 52:19.999
So we haven't won a year's supply
of tights, then?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.319
"Please accept,
with our compliments,

52:22.320 --> 52:24.399
"this selection
of our latest hosiery,

52:24.400 --> 52:27.399
"featuring tutti frutti
and op-art fashions

52:27.400 --> 52:30.479
"for the loveliest
and most lissom limbs.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.479
"Plus one 10% discount voucher

52:32.480 --> 52:35.119
"redeemable
against future purchases."

52:35.120 --> 52:39.399
One 10% discount voucher?
That's not going to go very far.

52:39.400 --> 52:41.879
Do let's take a peek!

52:41.880 --> 52:46.797
What do they mean when they say
"tutti frutti" and "op-art"?

52:48.600 --> 52:51.239
There's a bright fuchsia pair here.
I quite like them.

52:51.240 --> 52:53.679
Oh. Turquoise fishnets!

52:53.680 --> 52:58.597
If you think you're wearing those
for work, I beg to differ.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.119
5oz in a week.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.079
Top marks to Master Bowland.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.000
And his mother.

53:07.280 --> 53:11.197
We just need somebody else
to get top marks now.

53:17.040 --> 53:19.160
Come in.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.519
I wanted Primrose to have this.

53:23.520 --> 53:27.937
I made it from your nightdress.
It kept her warm once.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.370
It can keep her warm again.

53:35.600 --> 53:39.439
If that is payment in lieu
of wages for Mrs Donnelly,

53:39.440 --> 53:41.599
perhaps you ought to hand it to her.

53:41.600 --> 53:45.079
I thought to reimburse you
for her board and lodging.

53:45.080 --> 53:47.959
She is our guest for the present...

53:47.960 --> 53:51.919
...and will be making
her own financial decisions

53:51.920 --> 53:53.600
in the future.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.910
Leave it on the desk.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.820
I can manage this.

54:20.960 --> 54:23.119
Will you forgive me?

54:23.120 --> 54:25.800
Will it make you feel better?

54:29.960 --> 54:31.119
No.

54:31.120 --> 54:34.037
Then I'll leave things as they are.

54:34.760 --> 54:36.880
Please don't smile at me.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.840
I loved you.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.359
Don't you go filling
my sink up with soil.

55:18.360 --> 55:22.559
Look. I don't want it dying
on the way to the Mother House.

55:22.560 --> 55:26.319
And I want them to plant it
somewhere where Primrose can

55:26.320 --> 55:30.119
look at it and know
that she's got friends.

55:30.120 --> 55:31.360
Here.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.519
Oh, Vi.

55:44.520 --> 55:48.020
You put her on display,
with everyone else.

56:12.680 --> 56:16.097
Mother Mildred's
almost ready for the off.

56:17.720 --> 56:20.159
I've had to supply one bottle
of lemon barley

56:20.160 --> 56:21.519
and one of embrocation.

56:21.520 --> 56:24.437
Let's hope she doesn't mix them up.

56:25.200 --> 56:27.450
Don't let her back in here.

56:29.480 --> 56:31.439
Why?

56:31.440 --> 56:34.919
The council have notified us
that the whole of this street

56:34.920 --> 56:38.159
is to be demolished
within the next two years.

56:38.160 --> 56:41.910
And Nonnatus House
will be demolished with it.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.439
Surely Mother ought to be told?

56:44.440 --> 56:48.040
What can she do?
What can any of us do?

56:49.720 --> 56:52.959
Well, it would be a poor show

56:52.960 --> 56:55.959
if I didn't put a word in
for our old chum, prayer.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.440
Tell no-one.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.919
The past is never lost to us.

57:11.920 --> 57:15.004
We carry it with us,
everywhere we go.

57:16.440 --> 57:21.279
It is in every cell
of our body and our soul.

57:21.280 --> 57:23.719
It is where we have been.

57:23.720 --> 57:25.599
It was our son's blazer.

57:25.600 --> 57:28.359
Well done for passing
your 11-plus.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.959
- It is where we learn to love.
- Thank you.

57:30.960 --> 57:33.479
It is where we made our mistakes...

57:33.480 --> 57:35.039
All right there?

57:35.040 --> 57:37.840
...and where we can consign them.

57:39.760 --> 57:44.999
The gift is knowing
that the present will soon pass.

57:45.000 --> 57:51.360
And that the way we embrace it
has the power to change everything.

58:11.120 --> 58:13.159
It was my mother's
favourite variety,

58:13.160 --> 58:16.199
and Aubrey assures me it will bloom
by Mothering Sunday.

58:16.200 --> 58:18.839
I think it's best
we get this door down.

58:18.840 --> 58:21.559
Anyone ever told you you've got
eyes just like Paul McCartney?

58:21.560 --> 58:24.727
- No.
- He's my third favourite Beatle.

58:25.560 --> 58:28.639
- Show yourself!
- I'll tell you what, keep your stupid magazine!

58:28.640 --> 58:31.307
I was only looking at it anyway.
