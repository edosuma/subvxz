WEBVTT

00:01.252 --> 00:07.926
Lot 43A, a silver jewelry
box. A gift from Philip II
to Queen Elizabeth I.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.886
Do we categorize this
as jewelry or mementos?

00:09.969 --> 00:12.597
Mementos. Should do
well in this auction.

00:13.515 --> 00:15.225
Oh. The journal
of John Dee.

00:15.308 --> 00:16.434
John Dee?
Yes.

00:16.518 --> 00:18.770
Queen Elizabeth's
most trusted adviser.

00:18.937 --> 00:22.440
And if you believe the
legend, the Royal Court's
sorcerer supreme.

00:22.524 --> 00:23.566
Right.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.652
Scholars have been
searching for this
for centuries.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.363
Only recently
unearthed this
in London.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.115
Oh.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.034
Best keep this secure, hmm?

00:34.994 --> 00:36.079
Yes.

00:38.123 --> 00:39.207
Mmm-hmm.

00:59.811 --> 01:00.895
Who are you?

01:04.149 --> 01:05.316
You can't be in here.

01:07.736 --> 01:09.154
Listen, you can't
be in here!

01:09.487 --> 01:11.489
Hey! Hey!
Can't you hear?

01:12.031 --> 01:13.241
She said you can't be...

01:13.867 --> 01:15.326
I need you to
turn around slowly...

01:15.994 --> 01:18.747
Turn around and put
your hands up! Now!

01:18.830 --> 01:21.583
I'm talking to you!
Turn around and put
your hands in the air!

01:23.501 --> 01:24.586
That's it.

01:27.213 --> 01:28.631
Put your hands
in the air.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.762
Drop it and get
on the ground now!

02:08.379 --> 02:09.464
Just like a candle.

02:09.589 --> 02:10.632
Crane?

02:10.715 --> 02:12.550
Lieutenant,
thank you for joining me.

02:12.634 --> 02:14.177
Next time,
a little context when

02:14.302 --> 02:15.804
you text me to meet
at a strange address.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.639
What are we
doing here?
Exploring.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.433
A three-bedroom,
two-bath Craftsman.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.894
Or so I've managed
to decipher
from this posting.

02:23.895 --> 02:25.438
House hunting?

02:26.064 --> 02:27.106
You bring me
house hunting?

02:27.690 --> 02:29.567
Less of a hunt,
more a scouting
expedition.

02:31.903 --> 02:33.571
Well, hello!

02:33.738 --> 02:34.906
I'm Keely.

02:35.532 --> 02:36.741
Please, look around.

02:37.367 --> 02:40.078
You'll notice
all the charming
details throughout.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.413
Now, I know
the bedrooms
are a tad cozy.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.748
"Cozy" is code for
too small to live in.

02:43.832 --> 02:46.000
And the backyard
is a bit rustic.

02:46.084 --> 02:47.669
"Rustic" means
you'll need a landscaper.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.420
How are the bathrooms?

02:49.546 --> 02:51.172
They're in their
original condition.

02:51.673 --> 02:52.757
Older than me.

02:52.924 --> 02:54.008
Excuse me.

02:55.093 --> 02:57.095
Yeah, well, you
figured out the real code.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.556
Lieutenant.

03:03.393 --> 03:04.644
Hmm?

03:04.727 --> 03:06.437
One cannot even buy
a home without being

03:06.604 --> 03:08.356
bombarded with
modern-day hucksterism.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.692
We call it marketing.
People even get
degrees for it.

03:11.276 --> 03:12.944
True fact.
People leave with a more

03:13.069 --> 03:14.696
positive impression
if you give them...

03:14.779 --> 03:16.406
Mini muffins!

03:17.115 --> 03:19.033
Oh. Thank you.
You're welcome.

03:22.996 --> 03:24.205
Marketing.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.001
Are you
seriously considering
buying a house?

03:28.084 --> 03:31.671
'Cause if you are,
there are bigger issues
than decoding realtor-speak.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.715
You need a credit rating,
bank approval and...

03:33.798 --> 03:36.217
Not to mention
an actual income.

03:36.301 --> 03:38.595
Call this an
exercise in optimism.

03:39.596 --> 03:42.432
Generous though you've
been in allowing me
Sheriff Corbin's cabin,

03:42.515 --> 03:45.268
sooner or later,
I must find
a place of my own.

03:45.977 --> 03:47.729
Preferably with
granite countertops.

03:48.146 --> 03:49.230
That's gonna have
to be later.

03:49.981 --> 03:52.358
There was a robbery
at an auction house in
White Plains last night,

03:52.442 --> 03:53.526
two people were killed.

03:54.152 --> 03:58.197
Preliminary reports
suggest that the blood
boiled inside their body.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.365
Boiled?

03:59.449 --> 04:00.992
The MEs are stumped.

04:01.451 --> 04:04.329
Security cam didn't
pick up a clear
image of the killer.

04:06.789 --> 04:07.749
Was this book stolen?

04:07.832 --> 04:08.833
Yeah.

04:09.042 --> 04:11.920
It belonged to John Dee,
an Elizabethan-era
academic...

04:12.003 --> 04:13.880
And famed student
of the occult.

04:14.172 --> 04:16.549
He spent years
compiling spells
into books.

04:16.883 --> 04:18.760
This is known as
the <i>Grand Grimoire,</i>

04:19.761 --> 04:21.930
the volume of
forbidden black magic.

04:22.013 --> 04:24.265
So Dee was on
the dark side of the
magical train tracks?

04:24.349 --> 04:26.017
No, he was a scholar.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.810
He wanted to
understand the power

04:27.936 --> 04:29.646
of the dark forces
and keep it hidden away.

04:30.855 --> 04:34.275
The <i>Grand Grimoire</i> has
been much sought after
in magic circles.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.779
But I'm afraid I'm no
expert on the subject.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.948
Where is our
specialist in
that department?

05:00.009 --> 05:03.304
Two hundred years in purgatory
have dearly sapped my skills,

05:03.388 --> 05:05.014
but I'm gradually
growing stronger.

05:06.683 --> 05:09.936
And now, as we enter
a time of perigean tide,

05:10.561 --> 05:12.105
my powers are peaking.

05:14.899 --> 05:16.192
That's handy.

05:16.776 --> 05:20.405
Magic is an innate talent,
but it must be
honed through practice.

05:20.613 --> 05:24.450
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
that we can count on that
talent to help us now.

05:26.744 --> 05:27.787
The <i>Grand Grimoire?</i>

05:28.037 --> 05:30.665
This is a powerful
and dangerous spell book.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.792
It was stolen from a local
auction house last night.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.377
Here? After all this time?

05:34.877 --> 05:36.504
Someone must have
drawn it to this place,

05:37.005 --> 05:38.423
perhaps through
a summoning spell.

05:38.548 --> 05:39.757
A magical someone?

05:39.841 --> 05:42.093
Or another tormented
soul released

05:42.218 --> 05:44.429
from purgatory
after Moloch's death.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.390
The consequences
of Moloch's evil
may never cease.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.644
I know you
still mourn our son.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.151
I just hope his actions
have brought him some peace.

06:01.112 --> 06:04.282
<i>Physical fitness has never</i>
<i>been so cheap. You can do it.</i>

06:07.201 --> 06:09.704
<i>The brand-new invention</i>
<i>that's specifically</i>

06:09.787 --> 06:11.748
<i>designed for</i>
<i>any small kitchen!</i>

06:12.498 --> 06:13.583
Yes?

06:14.667 --> 06:15.835
Mr. Parish.

06:16.002 --> 06:18.463
I'm sorry it took so
long to get back to you.
You said you had a problem?

06:18.546 --> 06:19.714
The hot water is out.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.558
Damn. So it is.
I'll send Ronnie
up right away.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.185
He's my son.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.314
If you'd like,
I can also send
a cleaning lady.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.482
That won't be necessary.

06:37.732 --> 06:38.900
It's no trouble.

06:40.443 --> 06:43.404
Look, I don't
get a lot of
long-term guests,

06:43.488 --> 06:45.907
and, frankly,
not ones that pay
up front and in cash.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.909
All I need is my privacy.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.703
<i>Sources</i>
<i>close to the case</i>
<i>say they're stumped</i>

06:50.787 --> 06:52.330
<i>by the bizarre</i>
<i>nature of the deaths</i>

06:52.455 --> 06:56.542
<i>at the auction house,</i>
<i>which involved</i>
<i>"unusual blood activity."</i>

06:56.918 --> 06:59.796
I was watching
this earlier, so weird.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.048
Ever seen
anything like it?

07:04.300 --> 07:05.384
Yes, I have.

07:06.803 --> 07:09.222
And if I could forget
all about it, I would.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.102
Well, we all have things
we're trying to get past.

07:14.185 --> 07:16.521
I mean, we're
only human, right?

07:25.571 --> 07:28.199
Forensics came back.
They identified
blood at the scene.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.325
Didn't belong
to the victims.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.120
No match,
but it was laced
with an alkaloid,

07:32.203 --> 07:35.081
a compound commonly
found in a plant,
<i>Datura stramonium.</i>

07:35.414 --> 07:37.125
Also known...
Jimson weed.

07:38.042 --> 07:39.627
Witches call it moonflower.

07:43.131 --> 07:45.049
Before performing
dangerous spells,

07:45.133 --> 07:48.302
certain
practitioners ingest it
to augment their power.

07:48.386 --> 07:50.054
It's like doping
in the magic world.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.557
Steroids. It's a
substance athletes use

07:52.682 --> 07:54.183
to make their bodies
unnaturally strong.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.686
Well, this sorcerer
uses blood magic.

07:58.771 --> 08:01.107
Witches draw their magic
from different sources.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.775
Katrina's power
flows from nature.

08:02.859 --> 08:05.903
Others from fire,
from the moon and the stars.

08:06.988 --> 08:09.991
Blood magic is one
of the dark arts.

08:10.074 --> 08:15.246
<i>A destructive form of sorcery</i>
<i>that taps into base,</i>
<i>evil forces.</i>

08:27.758 --> 08:28.885
Ah.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.929
Here's the
security cam footage
from the auction house.

08:33.014 --> 08:35.016
I thought it
proved inconclusive.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.393
Some kind of
electrical surge
wiped out most of it,

08:37.476 --> 08:38.978
but a few
frames survived.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.147
Called in a favor from
a friend at Quantico.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.858
They're experimenting
with a new image
enhancement algorithm.

08:44.108 --> 08:47.403
It isolates pixels
off reflective surfaces
in the environment.

08:48.196 --> 08:49.280
That make sense?

08:49.405 --> 08:50.448
Oh, yes, entirely.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.493
Well,
maybe save one detail.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.288
Pixels?

08:59.290 --> 09:01.000
Oh, pixels.
Mmm-hmm.

09:03.127 --> 09:05.046
Pixels. Thank you.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.133
Any luck with
the research?

09:09.217 --> 09:10.218
Not yet.

09:10.301 --> 09:12.261
But these books contain
much about the <i>Grimoire.</i>

09:12.345 --> 09:13.346
Ah.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.680
Magic.

09:22.813 --> 09:23.898
Katrina?

09:25.233 --> 09:26.275
Do you recognize him?

09:26.359 --> 09:27.818
His name is Solomon Kent.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.030
<i>He's the warlock</i>
<i>all witches fear.</i>

09:33.491 --> 09:36.244
<i>Moloch's death</i>
<i>must have freed him</i>
<i>from purgatory,</i>

09:36.327 --> 09:38.120
<i>and now he is</i>
<i>in our world.</i>

09:47.338 --> 09:49.590
<i>And wherever</i>
<i>Solomon Kent goes,</i>

09:49.715 --> 09:52.009
<i>terror and death</i>
<i>are sure to follow.</i>

10:26.502 --> 10:29.338
Solomon Kent.
Solomon Kent. Here.

10:29.422 --> 10:30.881
Born 1661.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.591
Was a Puritan
minister and leader

10:32.717 --> 10:34.343
of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony.

10:34.427 --> 10:35.845
Salem.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.471
He was one of the leaders
of the town of Salem.

10:37.555 --> 10:39.932
Salem, as in the
Salem witch trials?

10:40.016 --> 10:41.726
His family came
to Massachusetts

10:41.892 --> 10:43.602
during the Great
Puritan Migration.

10:44.061 --> 10:48.566
He grew up a spiritual man,
a pillar of the community,
beloved by all.

10:50.735 --> 10:53.362
<i>Times were hard back then,</i>
<i>but the town was close-knit.</i>

10:53.821 --> 10:55.823
<i>Everyone pulled together,</i>
<i>no matter their background.</i>

10:55.906 --> 10:56.991
Thank you, Mrs. Parsons.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.076
I don't know the
next time we'll
have fresh bread,

10:59.160 --> 11:00.661
especially if this
drought lingers.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.246
As providence decrees.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.043
Peace be upon you.
And upon you.

11:08.044 --> 11:10.254
Will I be seeing you
at the prayer group
tonight, Reverend?

11:10.755 --> 11:13.132
Prayer group?
Ah, yes.

11:14.008 --> 11:15.343
This drought must end.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.429
Until then, Mrs. Van Tassel.

11:19.430 --> 11:20.723
<i>Van Tassel.</i>

11:21.098 --> 11:22.892
The year 1692.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.603
So this woman's
your grandmother.

11:25.728 --> 11:26.771
Helena Van Tassel.

11:27.438 --> 11:29.982
She was among
the first of the Dutch
to come to the New World.

11:30.775 --> 11:34.862
She settled in
Salem because it was
a home to a very strong coven,

11:34.945 --> 11:35.988
one led by Kent.

11:37.365 --> 11:39.408
My mother was only
a young girl at the time,

11:40.284 --> 11:42.286
<i>but she never forgot</i>
<i>what happened in Salem.</i>

11:43.120 --> 11:45.206
And she made sure
I would never forget either.

11:45.289 --> 11:48.125
The Puritans believed magic
was all around them.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.836
Even those such as
Kent's coven who sought
to do good with it,

11:50.920 --> 11:52.797
they still had to
hide their identities.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.841
People distrust
that which they
do not understand.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.093
So what happened?

11:57.218 --> 11:58.386
Kent lost his way.

11:58.677 --> 12:02.306
<i>He became infatuated</i>
<i>with a young woman</i>
<i>named Sarah Osborne.</i>

12:05.810 --> 12:07.686
A worker is only as
good as their tools.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.399
This blade is far too
dull for work or safety.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.950
It's not so bad.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.869
I thought it was much worse.

12:25.955 --> 12:26.997
Thank you.

12:27.498 --> 12:28.582
<i>He thought</i>
<i>his feelings</i>

12:28.666 --> 12:30.709
<i>were being reciprocated,</i>
<i>but he was wrong.</i>

12:30.793 --> 12:32.753
Sarah.
Reverend.

12:39.635 --> 12:42.805
<i>My grandmother knew</i>
<i>this could end in heartbreak,</i>

12:46.267 --> 12:48.477
<i>but she did not know</i>
<i>it would end in tragedy.</i>

12:53.607 --> 12:54.775
Reverend.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.695
You sent for me.

12:57.862 --> 13:00.030
A worker is only as
good as their tools.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.242
For you.

13:04.660 --> 13:05.661
Ah.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.832
Thank you.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.545
Reverend.

13:15.379 --> 13:19.008
Do not be frightened.
I know what's in your heart.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.719
The same as
what's in mine.

13:24.555 --> 13:25.598
No!
Ahhh!

13:28.601 --> 13:29.727
Sarah!

13:29.810 --> 13:31.729
<i>It was</i>
<i>a terrible accident.</i>

13:32.313 --> 13:33.647
Was that a scream?

13:33.731 --> 13:35.733
<i>But Kent</i>
<i>knew how it would look.</i>

13:37.026 --> 13:41.280
<i>In his fear and panic,</i>
<i>Kent chose</i>
<i>a desperate way out.</i>

13:52.625 --> 13:53.751
We heard screaming.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.002
She attacked me.

13:55.628 --> 13:58.964
But I fought her back!
The Devil is upon us!

13:59.423 --> 14:01.967
We are beset by his servants.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.304
There are witches among us!

14:06.388 --> 14:08.974
<i>My grandmother</i>
<i>tried to appeal to</i>
<i>the good in Kent,</i>

14:09.058 --> 14:10.726
<i>to the man she</i>
<i>thought she knew.</i>

14:12.228 --> 14:13.437
Helena, it was an accident.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.941
Your lie has
spread like the plague.
You must end this madness.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.442
They will have my head.

14:18.609 --> 14:19.902
Throw yourself
at their mercy.

14:20.945 --> 14:22.613
Trust in their kindness.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.910
Do not force me to make
this decision for you.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.957
<i>But Kent was</i>
<i>too fearful for trust.</i>

14:34.833 --> 14:36.377
<i>So he turned on Helena...</i>

14:42.091 --> 14:44.134
...<i>and was</i>
<i>forever turned himself.</i>

14:45.719 --> 14:50.599
Behold, another witch.
Witness her unholy gaze.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.186
Let this enemy
have no power over us.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.648
Seize her.
Do not allow her to speak.

14:57.815 --> 15:00.025
This is but
the beginning of a war.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.029
<i>The sentences</i>
<i>were swift and cruel.</i>

15:17.042 --> 15:19.753
The rest of Helena's family,
including my mother,

15:19.837 --> 15:22.131
fled Salem that night
never to return.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.596
So Solomon Kent is responsible
for the Salem witch trials.

15:28.679 --> 15:31.056
A period of mass
paranoia and persecution.

15:31.140 --> 15:32.266
It still
haunts us.

15:32.558 --> 15:35.352
Every kid in America
reads <i>The Crucible,</i>
a play about Salem,

15:36.020 --> 15:39.189
but it's really about
the mass hysteria over
communism in the 1950s.

15:39.523 --> 15:43.152
"Let us not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason.

15:43.736 --> 15:47.072
"Remember,
we are not descended
from fearful men."

15:47.323 --> 15:49.199
Jefferson?
Edward R. Murrow.

15:50.451 --> 15:52.578
He was a journalist
in the 1950s

15:52.661 --> 15:55.039
who spoke out against
these modern witch trials.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.041
You been catching up
on your country's history?

15:57.541 --> 15:59.627
It is heartening to discover
men like Mr. Murrow.

16:00.628 --> 16:02.630
Would have made the
founding fathers proud.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.924
Well, let's make them
proud by locating
this <i>Grimoire.</i>

16:06.383 --> 16:08.010
If I can access
its last location,

16:08.093 --> 16:10.179
I may be able to track
its mystical signature.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.724
How was Kent able to survive
the witch trials unscathed?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.434
He survived,
but not unscathed.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.437
<i>The dark forces he</i>
<i>cultivated allowed him</i>

16:18.562 --> 16:20.606
<i>to fend off</i>
<i>the retribution</i>
<i>for a while,</i>

16:20.689 --> 16:22.650
<i>but eventually the coven's</i>
<i>surviving members</i>

16:22.733 --> 16:24.985
<i>combined their powers</i>
<i>and hunted him down.</i>

16:27.780 --> 16:29.573
<i>They exiled him</i>
<i>to purgatory.</i>

16:29.907 --> 16:30.991
Sarah!

16:33.243 --> 16:35.204
Entering our world,
Kent must have cast

16:35.329 --> 16:37.331
a spell to draw
the <i>Grimoire</i> to him.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.625
The question is why?

17:05.651 --> 17:07.736
I take it you can't
locate the <i>Grimoire.</i>

17:07.820 --> 17:10.781
No, but I sensed
something else.
It's not whole.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.118
John Dee bound
the book with a spell

17:14.284 --> 17:17.663
so that no one could
access any part of it
unless the book was whole,

17:18.247 --> 17:20.958
to make sure
the magic within it
could not spread widely.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.795
Whoever handled the book
must have split up the pages.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.464
Will it work without
the missing pages?

17:27.798 --> 17:28.882
No.

17:29.133 --> 17:31.343
Then he cannot
access its power yet.

17:31.427 --> 17:33.804
We need to find
the second half of
that book before Kent.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.936
Hey, Ramirez.
I need you to
check something for me.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.522
The auction house
had a delayed shipment
due to bad weather,

17:43.605 --> 17:45.232
slowing one of
its cargo ships.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.151
I need an ETA
for the new
delivery date, thanks.

17:51.655 --> 17:52.656
Captain Irving.

17:52.823 --> 17:53.782
Losing your edge, Mills.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.075
I've been tailing
you for 50 yards.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.410
Next time try calling.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.289
A little advance
warning goes a long way,
considering your situation.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.916
I wasn't trying
to sneak up on you.

18:03.417 --> 18:04.501
It's just...

18:04.835 --> 18:06.336
After we left it
at the precinct,

18:06.503 --> 18:08.005
I wasn't sure
you'd take my call.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.090
What do you want?

18:10.841 --> 18:12.050
I'll be straight with you.

18:13.177 --> 18:17.181
I was pretty pissed
when you didn't trust me.

18:18.724 --> 18:19.933
After all I've done.

18:20.225 --> 18:24.021
Your soul was stolen
by a Horseman of
the Apocalypse.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.440
Just kind of hard
to tell which side of
the line you're on now.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.109
That's why I
went to Katrina.

18:29.193 --> 18:31.820
She's proven my
soul is clean.

18:32.696 --> 18:36.241
And the truth is,
I don't even blame you
for not trusting me.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.871
Cynthia and I decided
we need a fresh start.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.957
Put the past behind us.
No grudges.

18:45.167 --> 18:48.420
So as far as I'm concerned,
you and me, we're good.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.380
Just wanted you
to know that.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.052
Frank.

18:56.512 --> 18:59.431
It was 25 yards.
You were tucked
behind the buttress.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.600
A bear in heat
would've made less noise.

19:02.518 --> 19:04.311
So I wasn't
sneaking up on you.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.063
Good to see you, Mills.

19:12.820 --> 19:13.987
Hello?

19:14.112 --> 19:17.533
Oh, hey! Um, Ronnie.
My mom sent me
to fix the faucet.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.460
Ah, hey, a little
hobby of mine.

19:28.919 --> 19:32.005
Yeah, I see you
build models, too.
Your detail work is great.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.216
You use an,
uh, 11 blade?

19:34.424 --> 19:36.218
Just my pocket knife.
Oh.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.428
You got to show me
how you did those edges.

19:38.512 --> 19:41.181
Oh, if you need any wood,
I got plenty downstairs.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.016
I'm building some
ramps for my mom.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.519
Your mother,
what happened to her?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.938
Got clipped by a drunk driver
a few years ago.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.567
It was a tough break,
but she never complained,
not once.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.026
Seems like a strong woman.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.945
She is.

19:55.988 --> 19:56.989
Who needs a dad, right?

19:57.114 --> 19:58.156
Indeed.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.660
Fathers are never what
they're cracked up to be.

20:04.621 --> 20:07.457
No, keep it.
Plenty where
those came from.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.891
The auction house's
shipment was diverted

20:23.974 --> 20:25.726
to a regional air
freight company.

20:25.809 --> 20:28.186
It's arriving at
the Westchester
distribution hub tonight.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.188
We must be there
to intercept it.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.523
Yeah. Right.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.778
Lieutenant, is there
something else?

20:37.487 --> 20:38.614
I ran into Irving.

20:38.697 --> 20:39.823
More like he ran into me.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.074
What did he want?

20:41.158 --> 20:44.161
To tell me that
he doesn't blame us
for being suspicious.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.496
Just wanted to say
that he's moving on.

20:46.997 --> 20:49.333
Letting go of the past
can be difficult.

20:51.752 --> 20:52.794
Crane?

20:52.920 --> 20:53.921
Letting go of the past.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.592
Kent has had 400 years
to think on his mistakes,

20:58.675 --> 21:00.677
on everything
that he's lost.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.138
What if he cannot let go?

21:05.057 --> 21:07.059
There is a spell in
the <i>Grand Grimoire.</i>

21:09.853 --> 21:11.188
A resurrection spell.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.607
Resurrection.
Sarah Osborne.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.277
Sarah!

21:17.611 --> 21:19.947
What if he's trying
to bring Sarah Osborne
back from the dead?

21:20.113 --> 21:22.157
I've been reading up on this
since Irving came back.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.283
One thing's for sure,

21:23.367 --> 21:25.953
once the gates of
the afterlife have opened,
they're not easily shut.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.121
If Kent opens these gates,

21:28.538 --> 21:29.831
Sarah Osborne's
soul will not be

21:29.957 --> 21:31.249
the only one to
enter this realm.

21:32.084 --> 21:35.587
The world of
the living will be
overwhelmed by the dead.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.048
We need to get
to that warehouse.

21:41.301 --> 21:45.055
So, Katrina's
gonna do her
mystical radar thing?

21:45.138 --> 21:46.139
Yes.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.350
If Kent or
the <i>Grimoire</i> are near,

21:48.475 --> 21:50.560
her Spidey senses
shall inform us.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.730
Hey, someone's been
catching up on his reading.

21:54.731 --> 21:55.816
Only the classics.

21:56.692 --> 21:59.695
You know, you and
Kent actually have
a lot in common.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.363
Both men out of time,

22:01.446 --> 22:03.657
unwilling to give up
on the women you love.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.536
How heartening to
know you compare me
to a murderous warlock.

22:08.245 --> 22:09.871
What I'm saying is,

22:11.039 --> 22:13.166
unlike Kent, you made
the right choices.

22:14.084 --> 22:16.086
He let his regret
over his mistakes

22:16.211 --> 22:18.171
turn him into
something dark and evil.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.425
Regret can change
the direction of your life.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.844
Or stop you from
living the one you're
meant to have.

22:23.927 --> 22:28.640
Lieutenant,
do you have a vision
of the life in store for us?

22:29.266 --> 22:30.434
No.

22:32.060 --> 22:35.355
All I know is that
being a Witness is not
a nine-to-five job.

22:35.439 --> 22:38.734
You can't punch out
and go back to
your three-bedroom,

22:39.776 --> 22:41.987
two-bath Craftsman
at the end of the day.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.823
Our enemies are willing
to do whatever it takes.

22:45.449 --> 22:46.658
We have to do the same
to defeat them.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.660
Yes, I violently agree,

22:49.286 --> 22:51.163
but we do not fight
against something.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.290
We fight for something.

22:54.124 --> 22:58.211
For love, family, a life.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.590
I pray we never lose sight
of what is important,

23:02.132 --> 23:04.885
for that is what
drove Kent into darkness.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.844
You are witch breed.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.682
Helena?
No!

23:53.141 --> 23:54.976
But her blood runs
through my veins.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.687
That is why
I will stop you.

23:57.771 --> 24:01.691
Child, if witches have
agency in this world,

24:02.859 --> 24:04.361
it is because of me.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.488
The darkness has
turned you mad.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.282
And given me powers
that you couldn't
possibly fathom.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.536
Or could you?

24:13.411 --> 24:15.956
Do I sense seeds
of darkness within?

24:17.332 --> 24:19.209
Have you never
wondered why your powers

24:19.334 --> 24:21.211
betray you when you
need them the most?

24:22.379 --> 24:24.714
You are walking
the wrong path.

24:24.923 --> 24:27.551
What would you
know about my path?

24:28.552 --> 24:30.595
I know that you
cannot defeat me

24:30.720 --> 24:32.848
because you are not
one with yourself.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.225
Has your soul been so twisted,

24:36.059 --> 24:38.728
you've forgotten
all that's sacred
to our people?

24:38.895 --> 24:40.605
You have broken that bond.

24:40.689 --> 24:41.982
Yes.

24:42.065 --> 24:45.193
But now, I will
make everything right.

25:07.257 --> 25:08.258
Rise.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.226
Go!

25:39.581 --> 25:40.832
I took out one of them.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.000
What happened to the one
that was after you?

25:42.083 --> 25:43.376
We were able
to evade it.

25:43.543 --> 25:44.628
I will stop Kent,

25:45.337 --> 25:46.880
but I need you to keep
the other demon at bay.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.132
Katrina, be careful.

26:34.844 --> 26:38.598
Curb thy foul stench,
unholy minion.

26:50.568 --> 26:51.820
You really need to
work on your trash talk.

26:51.945 --> 26:53.196
My...

26:53.280 --> 26:54.364
Katrina.

27:06.418 --> 27:09.421
You are a formidable witch,

27:11.047 --> 27:13.550
but you resist
your full potential.

27:14.926 --> 27:16.344
Give in to the darkness.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.556
There you will
find your true self.

27:32.736 --> 27:33.987
There. Now you see.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.247
Katrina.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.253
Kent, he has
the <i>Grimoire?</i>

27:50.337 --> 27:52.297
Yes. And it's complete.

27:53.256 --> 27:57.761
And now that he has the book,
I am no match for
the power of his magic.

27:59.637 --> 28:00.680
I cannot defeat him.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.398
Where would Kent go?

28:10.607 --> 28:11.775
Is there anything
else he needs

28:11.900 --> 28:13.026
to complete the
resurrection spell?

28:13.109 --> 28:14.361
Literature's unclear.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.446
Are you able to sense
the <i>Grimoire</i> anymore?

28:20.825 --> 28:22.535
Katrina?
No.

28:23.495 --> 28:27.207
The battle has taken
its toll. It might be some
time before I recover.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.377
We need to act now.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.338
I'm gonna check
on a few things.
Maybe you and Katrina can

28:33.421 --> 28:35.548
come up with a Plan B
on how to take him down.

28:35.632 --> 28:36.633
Hmm.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.596
You seem shaken.

28:42.806 --> 28:44.974
Magic is no ordinary weapon.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.977
It simply cannot be
reloaded like a musket.

28:49.020 --> 28:52.774
There are dimensions
to my magic that even
I have not explored.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.027
I will find Kent.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.655
And when I do,
there is no magic

28:58.822 --> 29:00.782
in the world that
can protect him.

29:04.202 --> 29:05.412
There you go, sir.

29:05.537 --> 29:06.746
Thank you.

29:08.498 --> 29:09.666
Captain.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.127
Thanks for meeting
me so late.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.462
No worries.
I was just watching TV.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.924
Do you know there's
a show where people
go on dates naked?

29:18.174 --> 29:20.301
Yeah, it's on after
the one where they
cook naked.

29:20.677 --> 29:21.803
I should have stayed dead.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.640
So, what's on your mind?

29:25.765 --> 29:27.684
What do you remember
about coming back?

29:28.351 --> 29:29.853
From the great beyond?
Yeah.

29:29.978 --> 29:33.106
Was there a
specific location
of reemergence?

29:33.189 --> 29:34.232
A portal?

29:34.357 --> 29:35.442
It's all a blank.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.778
Why? What's going on?

29:39.612 --> 29:41.698
We may be dealing
with an undead problem.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.617
You're the closest
thing we have to an
expert on the topic.

29:46.244 --> 29:47.996
If you're thinking
mystical portals,

29:48.121 --> 29:49.873
wouldn't Katrina
be your person?

29:49.956 --> 29:51.207
She's out of
commission right now.

29:52.709 --> 29:55.712
So you're a man down,
morale is low
and you're outgunned.

29:56.296 --> 29:57.380
Want my advice?

29:58.923 --> 30:00.091
You keep fighting.

30:01.968 --> 30:05.180
You don't back down,
you don't make excuses.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.057
If there is one
thing I've learned
from all I've been through,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.226
it's that you don't stop.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.271
Afterlife suits you.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.691
You seem to be
a lot more...

30:16.816 --> 30:18.610
Jacked up?

30:20.236 --> 30:23.656
I was gonna say
"alive," but we can go
with your version.

30:25.366 --> 30:27.911
Nothing like dying
to give you some
perspective on life.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.663
Captain, it's good
to have you back.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.375
Thanks.

30:37.712 --> 30:39.172
Hey!
What are you doing?

30:39.297 --> 30:40.757
Sorry,
my mom just...

30:40.840 --> 30:42.842
Oh, it's you.
Come here.

30:42.926 --> 30:44.177
What are you
doing in our room?

30:44.260 --> 30:45.303
I'm sorry. No one answered,

30:45.386 --> 30:47.055
so I was just checking
to see if everything
was all right.

30:47.138 --> 30:48.431
And who asked
you to do that?

30:48.598 --> 30:49.933
Ronnie!
Are you all right?

30:50.892 --> 30:53.353
I want you out of here now
or I'm gonna call the cops.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.688
Relax, <i>mamacita,</i>
the cops make a mess,

30:55.772 --> 30:58.107
and you never know
who's gonna get hurt
in the confusion.

30:59.317 --> 31:01.945
Be out of your
hair in a day or two.
<i>Comprendo?</i>

31:08.117 --> 31:10.578
Hey! You enjoying the show?

31:11.788 --> 31:13.706
Why don't you come down
for a better view?

31:25.802 --> 31:27.220
How's Katrina?

31:27.345 --> 31:28.805
Staying strong,
as always.

31:29.722 --> 31:30.765
That's good to hear.

31:30.848 --> 31:33.351
I'm guessing she won't
be able to answer
the bell for round two?

31:33.434 --> 31:36.020
No. That honor
falls upon us.

31:37.772 --> 31:40.858
The question is,
how to defeat Kent
without Katrina's magic?

31:41.276 --> 31:43.278
His powers are
most formidable.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.946
Before Katrina was here,

31:45.029 --> 31:48.908
we took down all kinds
of supernatural
threats without magic.

31:51.202 --> 31:54.414
I scanned all the 911 calls
for the past few hours.

31:54.497 --> 31:57.166
There are no zombies
walking the streets,

31:57.333 --> 31:59.961
so either Kent hasn't cast
the resurrection spell yet,

32:00.086 --> 32:02.297
or we're wrong
about what he's doing.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.257
When Katrina faced
off against Kent,

32:04.632 --> 32:06.759
he uttered
a most curious phrase.

32:10.930 --> 32:15.018
An ancient Aramaic dialect.
Translated it means,

32:16.311 --> 32:17.770
"I am the traveler."

32:21.441 --> 32:22.525
The traveler.

32:25.028 --> 32:26.613
Grace Dixon's journal.
Yeah.

32:26.696 --> 32:31.367
Grace cataloged
all of the magic
known to her world.

32:31.659 --> 32:34.370
At one point, she wrote about
the Traveler Spell.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.289
Ancient, powerful invocation.

32:36.581 --> 32:38.625
It allows the user
to jump into the past.

32:38.791 --> 32:43.296
To jump into the past,
as in travel through time?

32:43.880 --> 32:45.214
Mmm-hmm.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.551
Kent is not trying to
resurrect his lost love.

32:49.469 --> 32:50.595
He's trying to
go back to her.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.804
Do you know what
this could mean?

32:51.929 --> 32:53.014
The mind reels.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.892
Wait. If Kent goes back
and changes the past,

32:56.142 --> 32:58.311
he could start
a chain reaction
that rewrites history.

32:58.394 --> 33:01.397
Our lives,
our families, you and me,
everything that we know.

33:01.481 --> 33:04.734
Will be changed. Forever.

33:13.701 --> 33:15.745
To attempt the
Traveler Spell,

33:15.828 --> 33:19.082
Kent will need to
tap into an enormous
wellspring of energy,

33:19.165 --> 33:21.334
a convergence of
mystical fields.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.212
The ley lines.
Yes.

33:24.587 --> 33:27.590
And he will need to do so
at a time of astral synergy.

33:27.965 --> 33:30.885
Katrina said her powers
were heightened right now.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.011
Something about a tide.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.179
Perigean tide.

33:33.262 --> 33:35.014
When the moon is
closest to the Earth.

33:35.765 --> 33:38.226
The height of its effect
occurs at midnight.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.519
We only have
a couple of hours.

33:41.437 --> 33:45.108
Lieutenant, useful though
these reinforcements may be,

33:45.191 --> 33:47.860
I fear Kent's magic
may be more powerful still.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.445
Then we'll have
to make our own magic.

33:53.449 --> 33:54.534
I asked the captain to come.

33:55.618 --> 33:58.204
With Jenny off
chasing the Orb of
Mystical Awesomeness,

33:58.287 --> 34:02.125
or whatever artifact
she's looking for,
we're shorthanded.

34:05.962 --> 34:07.296
What else can you
tell me about this Kent?

34:08.673 --> 34:13.302
Uh, he is a powerful warlock
who practices blood magic.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.140
It is a visceral
power that he enhances

34:17.265 --> 34:19.851
artificially
through Jimson weed.

34:19.976 --> 34:21.310
Like some kind of
magical steroids?

34:21.728 --> 34:22.812
That's what I said.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.607
Captain,
you still have friends
in the forensic lab?

34:27.400 --> 34:29.360
We might need
the help of some chemists.

34:30.194 --> 34:34.282
After Kent knocked us back,
Katrina was able to fell him.

34:34.907 --> 34:37.618
Katrina's magic taps
into the natural world,

34:37.744 --> 34:40.413
the elements of wind,
rain, lightning.

34:40.580 --> 34:42.832
Elements.
Now, we can work with that.

34:43.207 --> 34:45.918
We're gonna need a generator,
possibly a fire hose.

34:46.002 --> 34:47.795
It'll take a little time
to get everything together.

34:48.171 --> 34:50.840
Why don't you and
Frank figure out
who's gonna man the equipment

34:50.923 --> 34:52.258
while I go get
ready to face Kent.

34:52.341 --> 34:54.761
No. I will face Kent.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.972
You asked me before
about my commitment
to the cause.

34:58.055 --> 34:59.390
Crane, you don't need
to prove anything to me.

34:59.599 --> 35:00.683
No, I do not.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.686
I will prove it to Kent.

35:44.602 --> 35:45.728
Sarah!

35:55.238 --> 35:56.739
You do not belong here.

36:04.247 --> 36:05.498
Tricks!

36:06.290 --> 36:10.336
Tricks will not protect you.
I have defeated
your spell caster.

36:11.754 --> 36:13.297
She understands my power.

36:13.714 --> 36:16.300
Power that can
be turned against you.

36:24.934 --> 36:27.186
Atropine,
found in Jimson weed,

36:27.311 --> 36:29.564
which you use to
boost your powers.

36:30.398 --> 36:33.442
In high doses, it causes
hallucination and seizures,

36:34.026 --> 36:36.195
something we know
through modern chemistry.

36:37.488 --> 36:39.824
Your magic is vulnerable
to elemental energy,

36:40.449 --> 36:41.617
such as lightning.

36:42.785 --> 36:44.453
And in the 21st century,

36:45.496 --> 36:47.039
we make our own lightning.

36:57.967 --> 37:00.636
The spell caster
of whom you speak...

37:03.514 --> 37:05.850
...her name is
Katrina Van Tassel.

37:07.018 --> 37:09.228
And you've brought
harm to her family!

37:09.937 --> 37:11.480
And you've
brought harm to her!

37:13.482 --> 37:14.692
And to me!

37:16.694 --> 37:17.778
Crane.

37:19.155 --> 37:20.573
Crane.
Crane, come on.
It's over.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.703
Frank! It's done.
Irving!

37:30.333 --> 37:31.542
Irving!

38:00.154 --> 38:01.280
Captain!

38:03.032 --> 38:04.033
Captain!

38:04.158 --> 38:05.201
Over here!

38:12.041 --> 38:14.585
Kent's gone.
He disintegrated.

38:16.712 --> 38:17.880
The <i>Grimoire?</i>

38:18.381 --> 38:19.423
No trace.

38:20.216 --> 38:22.009
Must have been on his body,
destroyed with him.

38:26.055 --> 38:27.556
This was a good win.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.063
Damn right it was.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.871
You should put
some ice on that.

38:50.997 --> 38:52.707
Oh, no. I'll be fine.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.837
Very well.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.592
You surprised me
out there, Crane.

39:03.843 --> 39:05.261
Going all Rambo
like that.

39:05.469 --> 39:07.763
Remind me never to
lay a hand on Katrina.

39:07.847 --> 39:10.391
It was about more
than protecting my wife.

39:10.850 --> 39:14.395
Something in Kent's
story struck a nerve.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.565
That a person
could so easily betray

39:17.690 --> 39:20.109
the people who trust
and rely on him most.

39:21.444 --> 39:23.946
And after you said I
reminded you of him...

39:24.280 --> 39:25.614
Crane, you know I didn't...

39:25.781 --> 39:27.575
No offense was taken.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.995
But it made me
realize we are, all of us,

39:31.078 --> 39:33.998
walking a razor's edge
between darkness and light.

39:35.499 --> 39:37.251
Come on.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.794
I think we've
earned a couple of beers.

39:39.295 --> 39:41.047
Want to grab Katrina?

39:41.172 --> 39:42.923
Uh... No. She is resting.

39:43.007 --> 39:44.884
Said she does not
want to be disturbed.

39:48.304 --> 39:53.642
The epithets I hurled
at Kent during battle,
that was good trash talk?

39:54.351 --> 39:55.394
Wasn't bad.

39:55.478 --> 39:56.562
But for some real practice,

39:56.645 --> 39:58.606
I'm gonna have to take you
to a hockey game.

39:58.689 --> 39:59.774
Hockey.

40:40.189 --> 40:41.273
Good morning,
gentlemen.

40:41.398 --> 40:42.441
What the hell?

40:42.525 --> 40:44.610
I know you're
all very busy

40:44.693 --> 40:47.738
destroying your lives,
day after wretched day.

40:47.822 --> 40:49.532
What do you want?
Well, you see,

40:49.782 --> 40:51.992
I, too, have been
destroying my life.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.912
For weeks now,
I've hid from the world,

40:55.037 --> 40:57.331
unsure of who I am
or what I am to do.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.917
You see,
I killed my father.

41:00.376 --> 41:05.214
And since that time,
all I could feel
was crushing regret.

41:06.924 --> 41:09.593
But then I saw you
threatening
the woman and her son.

41:09.885 --> 41:12.054
Is that
what this is about?

41:12.513 --> 41:14.140
You don't need to get
all papa bear about it.

41:14.223 --> 41:15.516
Oh, no, you've
got it wrong.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.394
I admit that for
a moment I was drawn

41:18.519 --> 41:20.771
to what Mary and
Ronnie represented.

41:21.689 --> 41:24.150
A simple life,
simple needs,
humanity.

41:25.568 --> 41:27.153
But then you
reminded me
of something.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.699
There is a natural
order of things
in this world.

41:32.783 --> 41:36.203
There will always
be sheep and wolves.

41:37.955 --> 41:39.248
And I,

41:41.250 --> 41:42.585
I am a wolf.

42:03.814 --> 42:04.815
Hmm.

42:27.338 --> 42:29.798
Captain Irving,
good to see you.

42:31.133 --> 42:32.343
Didn't expect to
be back here again.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.971
Where it all
came to an end.

42:36.513 --> 42:37.598
I take it
you've been busy?

42:38.224 --> 42:39.808
The Witnesses
trust me again.

42:42.478 --> 42:44.396
They're so desperate
to believe in people.

42:46.565 --> 42:49.068
So, you're gonna use this
to fulfill Moloch's vision?

42:49.276 --> 42:51.987
Moloch is dead and
so are his plans.

42:52.988 --> 42:56.200
No longer am I
the Horseman of War.

42:57.618 --> 43:00.496
No longer will I be
defined by anyone else.

43:01.914 --> 43:05.751
From here on,
destiny bends to my will.

43:07.628 --> 43:08.837
You were wrong,
Captain Irving,

43:08.921 --> 43:11.507
when you said this
is where it all ended.

43:14.301 --> 43:15.344
This

43:16.637 --> 43:18.347
is where it all begins.
