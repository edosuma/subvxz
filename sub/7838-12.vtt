00:13.197 --> 00:15.922
Surprise !

00:24.343 --> 00:26.550
I don't see why I need
a new driving license.

00:26.702 --> 00:28.059
My old one's just fine.

00:28.963 --> 00:32.403
I have serious doubts about
your skill behind the wheel.

00:32.424 --> 00:34.508
You drove in with three
people on your grill.

00:36.446 --> 00:39.198
At least I'm out doing things.

00:40.765 --> 00:44.012
Do you know this baby once
outraced the Flying Finn,

00:44.140 --> 00:45.401
Paavo Nurmi?

00:47.248 --> 00:48.176
Turn the heater off.

00:48.177 --> 00:50.510
It's boiling in here!
- What are you talking about?

00:50.651 --> 00:53.089
This car is cooler
than Guy Lombardo.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.651
What's wrong with me?!

01:04.058 --> 01:06.575
Good heavens, she's some
sort of female madman!

01:07.114 --> 01:09.636
Hot... so hot!

01:11.943 --> 01:13.583
Stop that, you want-wit!

01:13.655 --> 01:15.757
I might get stung
by a bumbled-bee.

01:21.693 --> 01:23.348
Van Houten blows
past Simpson.

01:23.562 --> 01:25.233
He's got all the right moves.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.245
And a fight
breaks out!

01:32.583 --> 01:34.406
Car!
- Car what?

01:34.540 --> 01:36.859
Car is the subject,
but I don't know the verb.

01:42.507 --> 01:43.652
I still feel hot!

01:45.528 --> 01:48.121
Sir, thank God
the airbags activated!

01:48.264 --> 01:50.452
Those are my lungs!

01:53.705 --> 01:56.132
Selma, what you
experienced was a "hot flash,"

01:56.300 --> 01:58.077
an early symptom of menopause.

01:58.260 --> 01:59.494
What the hell is menopause?

01:59.626 --> 02:02.386
Son, menopause is when the stork

02:02.390 --> 02:06.525
that brings babies gets shot
by drunken hunters.

02:06.716 --> 02:08.352
It's a natural process

02:08.360 --> 02:10.866
that women of a
certain age go through.

02:10.877 --> 02:13.700
And it's something to be feared.
Right, Doctor?

02:14.728 --> 02:16.039
Far from it.

02:16.183 --> 02:18.028
Maybe we should all
take a look at this.

02:21.103 --> 02:23.347
What do you know.
She's out of eggs,

02:23.348 --> 02:25.443
and if you're watching this,
so are you.

02:25.671 --> 02:27.196
Hello, I'm Robert Wagner--

02:27.352 --> 02:31.157
actor, smooth customer,
and women's health advocate.

02:31.340 --> 02:33.944
Just as the end of the day
can bring great beauty,

02:34.029 --> 02:35.786
so too can the end
of menstruation

02:35.961 --> 02:38.185
be a time
of radiance and celebration.

02:39.074 --> 02:41.628
Sure, you may experience
mood swings,

02:41.830 --> 02:44.196
loss of desire,
and private dryness,

02:44.356 --> 02:45.231
but don't worry.

02:45.285 --> 02:47.653
You can still do everything
that you did before.

02:47.843 --> 02:50.158
Everything?
Including having children?

02:50.339 --> 02:51.962
Ma'am, we're trying
to make a video here.

02:52.114 --> 02:55.048
Menopause means you can't
have any more children,

02:55.212 --> 02:57.792
but it also marks
a wonderful new plateau

02:57.954 --> 02:59.102
in a woman's life.

02:59.286 --> 03:03.484
So let's all give menopause
a round of men-applause!

03:04.201 --> 03:06.045
"Men-applause"?
I'm not saying that.

03:08.817 --> 03:09.991
So that's it.

03:10.137 --> 03:11.259
The end of the line.

03:11.454 --> 03:13.833
I'm never gonna have children.

03:14.812 --> 03:18.464
Selma, I never realized
you wanted a child so badly.

03:18.648 --> 03:20.938
I didn't want to get pregnant
and lose my looks.

03:23.729 --> 03:26.911
But now I'm afraid
I'll grow old alone.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.937
What about your
pet iguana, Jub-Jub?

03:30.697 --> 03:34.081
Jub-Jub can't take care of me
when I'm old and sick.

03:34.233 --> 03:36.861
All he can do is eat me
when I'm dead.

03:37.053 --> 03:38.569
Don't cry, sweetie.

03:38.570 --> 03:40.307
Everything's gonna be all right.

03:40.565 --> 03:42.398
Come on, kids.
We should go.

03:42.572 --> 03:43.868
Good-bye, Selma.

03:43.869 --> 03:45.300
I'm not dead, idiot.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.193
I know. That was for
the other patients.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.126
My thingies!

03:53.849 --> 03:58.262
We now return to Son of Satan.

04:01.065 --> 04:03.435
Everyone has a child but me.

04:03.593 --> 04:04.590
Cheer up, sis.

04:04.767 --> 04:07.024
There's a dented can sale
down at Schwegman's.

04:07.802 --> 04:11.510
This is one problem
damaged food can't solve.

04:11.687 --> 04:13.366
Wow, you really
are down.

04:13.517 --> 04:15.837
Hey, you ever think
of adoption?

04:15.999 --> 04:17.942
The adoption process!

04:18.091 --> 04:19.478
That'll end the heartbreak.

04:20.463 --> 04:22.374
That foot's not dead.
It's just asleep.

04:26.994 --> 04:29.939
Oh, he's perfect.

04:30.105 --> 04:33.325
For this little guy,
I'm gonna give up smoking.

04:33.537 --> 04:36.012
From now on,
we're a Skoal family.

04:36.013 --> 04:37.013
From now on,
we're a Skoal family.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.453
Is this the baby pound
where I gived up my kid?

04:43.454 --> 04:45.169
'Cause I needs
to get him back.

04:45.397 --> 04:46.921
Oh, no! The birth father.

04:47.097 --> 04:48.847
I shouldn't have gived him away.

04:49.006 --> 04:50.828
Seems I misheard my wife.

04:51.015 --> 04:52.281
What she said was,

04:52.449 --> 04:55.032
she's tired of having rabies.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.906
Give me back my belly fruit!

04:58.478 --> 04:59.222
If  you want,

04:59.365 --> 05:01.963
I'll call you
after Brandine's next litter.

05:02.132 --> 05:03.449
Yeah. Pass!

05:05.597 --> 05:06.936
Don't give up,
Aunt Selma.

05:07.090 --> 05:10.698
China has thousands
of baby girls who need adoption.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.892
Great, another job lost
to a foreigner.

05:14.108 --> 05:16.563
Consulate of China
Russia's wacky neighbor

05:16.874 --> 05:19.801
Madam, your adoption application
is in perfect order...

05:19.984 --> 05:22.154
except for one thing.

05:23.297 --> 05:25.321
You forgot to fill out
the name of your husband.

05:25.489 --> 05:27.160
Husband.
- Of course.

05:27.165 --> 05:29.228
The Chinese government
only allows wholesome,

05:29.391 --> 05:30.719
married couples to adopt.

05:30.878 --> 05:32.647
No "hen without cock."

05:32.841 --> 05:35.722
I apologize if that is a
double-entendre in your language.

05:35.885 --> 05:37.657
It is not in ours.
- Don't worry.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.902
I'll just write my husband's
name on this form.

05:42.736 --> 05:44.085
Have you ever
heard of MacGyver?

05:44.266 --> 05:46.446
Oh yes. Big star. Big star.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.021
We know he's not married to you.

05:48.199 --> 05:49.634
Right, right, right.

05:49.801 --> 05:50.647
And don't forget--

05:50.798 --> 05:53.573
your husband must go with you
to China to pick up the baby.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.753
All right, here I go.
Writing the name.

06:01.171 --> 06:01.776
Excellent.

06:01.777 --> 06:05.075
You are Mrs. Homer Simpson.
He is your soul mate and lover.

06:05.230 --> 06:08.507
Yes, Homer Simpson
is my whole world.

06:09.465 --> 06:10.788
I love him.

06:12.401 --> 06:16.720
Oh,  I just felt a chill
go through my very soul.

06:16.929 --> 06:19.318
Yeah, those Sloppy Joes
will do that.

06:22.225 --> 06:24.018
How about that Selma ?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.976
Flying all of us to China
for no apparent reason.

06:27.156 --> 06:28.600
And how about me
getting off work

06:28.601 --> 06:31.940
by saying I'm teaching math
skills to inner city youths?

06:33.053 --> 06:35.749
Yes, there are many kinds
of heroes.

06:36.885 --> 06:38.608
Marge, when are
we gonna tell Homer

06:38.749 --> 06:40.770
he has to pretend
to be my husband?

06:40.897 --> 06:43.546
Wait till the Drambuie
and sleeping pills kick in.

06:45.742 --> 06:47.115
Hey, look, a dragon.

06:47.155 --> 06:48.311
Hello, Homer.

06:48.312 --> 06:50.509
Give me your peanuts,
and you can fly on my back.

06:50.799 --> 06:54.240
I'll give you... one.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.328
Oh, you are a very greedy man.

06:56.505 --> 06:58.448
The other dragons
shall hear of this.

06:59.597 --> 07:00.601
Hey, dragon!

07:00.759 --> 07:02.426
You fly like a girl!

07:02.616 --> 07:03.728
Go, go, go!

07:08.463 --> 07:11.222
Homer, I'm gonna need you
to do something for me

07:11.223 --> 07:12.398
when we get to China.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.863
You name it, oh, wise
mountain ape.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.755
You have to pretend
to be my husband.

07:19.814 --> 07:24.066
Nooo!

07:24.235 --> 07:25.006
That's him--

07:25.001 --> 07:27.089
the man who broke
a dragon's heart.

07:27.240 --> 07:32.781
The man who broke
a dragon's heart...

07:33.568 --> 07:36.305
Homer, if you do
this one small favor,

07:36.439 --> 07:38.243
it could transform
Selma's life.

07:38.382 --> 07:40.931
But, Marge, I don't
want her to be happy!

07:41.082 --> 07:43.210
Okay, don't do
it for her.

07:43.415 --> 07:45.589
Deal!
- Do it for me.

07:49.092 --> 07:51.745
Oh! Okay, I'll do it.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.247
'Cause your sweet love
is the one thing

07:54.396 --> 07:58.320
that saved my life from being
an unmitigated disaster.

07:58.470 --> 08:00.125
Ha-ha! Now we're even!

08:00.407 --> 08:01.650
This is your captain.

08:01.819 --> 08:03.516
We have started our descent

08:03.517 --> 08:05.757
and will soon be landing
in Beijing.

08:05.758 --> 08:07.511
If you look out
the left side of the aircraft,

08:07.705 --> 08:09.609
you will see our monument to warrior

08:09.757 --> 08:12.582
and spicy chicken pioneer,
General Gao.

08:12.615 --> 08:16.922
It makes the Lincoln Memorial
look like crap.

08:29.905 --> 08:31.185
Very good.

08:31.408 --> 08:33.570
You have passport, husband.

08:33.722 --> 08:37.256
All we need now is the sack
of 10,000 happinesses.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.004
When do I get my baby?
- In a few days.

08:48.163 --> 08:49.675
This will give you a chance

08:49.711 --> 08:52.001
to explore our nation's
ancient culture.

08:53.129 --> 08:55.976
And it will give me a chance
to closely observe

08:55.977 --> 08:59.127
the intimate details
of your married life.

09:01.445 --> 09:03.489
Madame Wu, these are...

09:04.262 --> 09:07.559
our children,
Bart and Lisa. Yes.

09:07.599 --> 09:12.270
And this is Marge,
our surprisingly hot nanny.

09:12.422 --> 09:15.722
Mmm. Thank you,
Mr. Simpson.

09:15.825 --> 09:18.074
Don't mention it,
Miss...

09:18.423 --> 09:19.967
October.

09:19.968 --> 09:21.235
But don't look
at her passport--

09:21.372 --> 09:22.400
it's different.

09:22.531 --> 09:25.065
These are the famous
Shaolin Temple monks.

09:25.227 --> 09:26.886
They pursue
spiritual peace

09:27.022 --> 09:29.251
through mastery of
bare-fisted murder.

09:29.428 --> 09:30.685
I've heard of these guys.

09:30.832 --> 09:33.313
You can wave your arms at them
and make funny faces,

09:33.446 --> 09:35.399
and they just have
to stand there and take it.

09:37.772 --> 09:40.687
Homer, no, stop; you're thinking
of Buckingham Palace!

09:40.855 --> 09:41.752
What?

10:01.070 --> 10:03.322
I hope you washed
your hands first.

10:05.787 --> 10:08.434
Oh-ho, look at him sleeping.

10:08.598 --> 10:12.322
He's like a little angel
that killed 50 million people.

10:12.537 --> 10:15.221
Yes, you are! Yes, you are!

10:17.999 --> 10:20.896
The Great Wall of China
was begun nearly 2,000 years ago

10:20.897 --> 10:23.527
in order to repel
barbarian invaders.

10:24.893 --> 10:26.027
With these pogo sticks,

10:26.171 --> 10:27.901
we'll finally make it over.

10:32.510 --> 10:33.115
All right,

10:33.171 --> 10:35.214
everyone take a break

10:35.260 --> 10:37.532
and come back Monday
with five fresh ideas.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.766
Can't make it Monday.
My kid has a thing.

10:39.809 --> 10:41.288
When I was 17,

10:41.432 --> 10:43.633
I  walked into the jungle,

10:43.798 --> 10:46.304
and by 21,
I walked out.

10:46.350 --> 10:48.537
And  by God, I was rich!

10:54.891 --> 10:57.040
Boys, you see
what I was talking about?

10:57.184 --> 10:59.342
The greatest things
can happen!

11:04.056 --> 11:06.960
I finally get this play!

11:07.500 --> 11:10.453
So, Mr. Simpson, what do you do for a living?

11:10.703 --> 11:12.150
I'm a nuclear...

11:12.600 --> 11:13.768
Wait a minute.

11:14.018 --> 11:15.103
These guys don't know me.

11:15.353 --> 11:17.353
I could be whatever I want.

11:19.717 --> 11:21.717
I'm a Chinese acrobat!

11:25.156 --> 11:27.150
You shall be back in the land you love soon.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.929
Tomorrow, we will give you your baby.

11:30.179 --> 11:32.250
Oh, my God! Really?

11:32.500 --> 11:34.753
My life begins at last!

11:35.003 --> 11:37.650
That  is quite an insult to your other children.

11:37.900 --> 11:38.968
We understand, ma'am.

11:39.218 --> 11:40.803
We're pretty lousy kids.

11:41.053 --> 11:45.567
Lisa, soon you will have a Chinese baby
sister who will surpass you academically.

11:45.817 --> 11:47.106
I don't know about that.

11:47.356 --> 11:50.050
I'm considered pretty smart.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.629
Well, Tibet was considered "pretty independent."

11:52.879 --> 11:54.050
How'd that work out?

11:54.300 --> 11:57.353
How dare you make light of that brutal....?

11:57.603 --> 11:59.553
Mind your manners, Lisa.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.768
Such loving discipline.

12:02.018 --> 12:06.068
Maybe someday, someone will love you too,
childless servant.

12:19.153 --> 12:23.267
I regret to inform you that our final
stunt will not be performed.

12:23.517 --> 12:26.768
Our star acrobat had an onset of outspokenness

12:27.018 --> 12:29.906
and suffered a bullet-related death.

12:30.156 --> 12:31.850
This is most disillusioning!

12:32.100 --> 12:34.629
It seems our leaders are not all-knowing!

12:34.879 --> 12:36.050
Now I will question everything!

12:36.300 --> 12:38.850
Why doesn't Pearl Jam ever come here?!

12:42.303 --> 12:43.550
We need your acrobatic skills.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.850
Only you can prevent this riot and save
our beloved Communist dictatorship.

12:49.118 --> 12:50.203
You guys are Commies?

12:50.453 --> 12:52.667
Then why am I seeing rudimentary free markets?

12:52.917 --> 12:54.906
Just go perform that stunt!

12:55.156 --> 12:57.656
Unless you are not who you claim to be.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.279
Show time!

13:05.500 --> 13:08.704
I give you the great American acrobat Homer Simpson

13:08.954 --> 13:11.253
to attempt our most popular stunt--

13:11.503 --> 13:13.503
Chair Man Wow!

13:18.400 --> 13:19.700
Nice chair toss.

13:20.718 --> 13:22.118
Good one, skinny.

13:23.153 --> 13:25.453
You guys get these chairs from Regal Rents?

13:26.217 --> 13:27.606
Boy, you're a great stacker.

13:27.856 --> 13:29.450
Hi, Lisa.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.450
Now, that's precarious.

13:35.079 --> 13:36.350
Boy, this is easy.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.600
Maybe I am the world's greatest acrobat.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.900
USA! USA! USA!

14:02.618 --> 14:05.203
You're curing me with acupuncture.

14:05.453 --> 14:08.867
No, a porcupine snuck in while you were asleep.

14:09.117 --> 14:10.206
Go on, shoo!

14:10.456 --> 14:11.450
Come back in year of porcupine.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.129
Which is never!

14:13.379 --> 14:15.350
I'd like you all to meet someone.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.600
Introducing... Ling Bouvier!

14:19.303 --> 14:21.553
Selma, she's beautiful!

14:23.300 --> 14:24.968
This is Homer, your daddy.

14:25.218 --> 14:27.468
Without him, I wouldn't have you.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.153
She likes my eyes.

14:32.817 --> 14:35.506
Homer, I do appreciate what you did.

14:35.756 --> 14:38.250
How'd you like a little time with "Miss October"?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.129
I would, but Marge would kill me...

14:40.379 --> 14:42.479
I mean, ohh, right.

14:48.300 --> 14:51.653
Homer, of all the sneaky,
dishonest things you've ever done,

14:51.903 --> 14:56.050
playing Selma's husband was by far the sweetest.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.668
It wasn't easy, Marge.

14:57.918 --> 14:59.968
I missed you so much.

15:02.453 --> 15:04.067
One quick snuggle.

15:04.317 --> 15:06.617
Is there any other kind?

15:14.456 --> 15:16.829
Fool me once, shame on you.

15:17.079 --> 15:20.079
Fool me twice, shame on Wu!

15:22.000 --> 15:24.960
Ling, you're gonna be very happy in America,

15:25.210 --> 15:27.210
unlike everyone else there.

15:31.403 --> 15:33.950
Selma Bouvier, this man is not your husband.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
And for that, no adoption.

15:39.018 --> 15:40.218
Ma-ma.

15:42.053 --> 15:44.203
They took my baby.

15:47.617 --> 15:50.917
Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate.

15:58.656 --> 16:01.250
I am so sorry about what happened.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.500
But at least you saw what it was like
to be married to me for a little while.

16:10.079 --> 16:12.250
Listen, I've got a plan to get Ling back.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.753
But we must be discreet.

16:14.003 --> 16:16.050
You never know where there might be a spy.

16:16.300 --> 16:20.050
Yes, tell me your plan in detail, American sister.

16:21.018 --> 16:22.868
Don't have cattle, dude.

16:23.353 --> 16:25.503
Let's talk about this outside.

16:30.217 --> 16:32.306
Hold still, Homie.

16:32.556 --> 16:33.250
Yeah, Dad.

16:33.500 --> 16:38.350
If you don't look perfect, you'll never be
able to sneak in and steal Ling back.

16:40.279 --> 16:41.850
You look just like a Buddha statue.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.250
Now, all you need is an expression of utter serenity.

16:47.203 --> 16:50.803
Just think about the day you found that
Junior Mint in your belly button.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.468
A Buddha statue?

16:58.918 --> 17:00.003
We cannot leave it outside.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.767
It is bad feng shui.

17:01.817 --> 17:02.406
Feng shui?

17:02.656 --> 17:05.750
I thought that was just a trick to
sell crappy end tables to the West.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Just put this hook in his nostril and pull.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.350
I've never moved a Buddha this heavy.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.600
Let's cut him in chunks and worship the chunks.

17:44.103 --> 17:46.453
Now let's see, which one is Ling?

17:51.900 --> 17:52.700
Ling?

17:53.718 --> 17:54.718
Ling?

18:09.956 --> 18:13.129
If we can just get to the Delta
Airlines Gold Medallion Lounge,

18:13.379 --> 18:16.150
they can't get in without
spending frequent flier miles.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.653
Plus, we get free apple,
orange and grapefruit juice.

18:19.903 --> 18:22.803
I'm afraid that juice is not
on your tongue just yet.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.450
Give the baby back.

18:29.618 --> 18:32.303
I cannot allow her to be raised
by an unmarried woman.

18:32.553 --> 18:36.367
Madam Wu, I too work for a
cruel and faceless empire:

18:36.617 --> 18:39.067
the Department of Motor Vehicles.

18:40.556 --> 18:43.450
May I talk to you bureaucrat to bureaucrat?

18:43.700 --> 18:45.700
Yes. But you first must sign this form.

18:46.879 --> 18:48.050
And initial here.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.453
And here.

18:49.703 --> 18:51.803
Now we must find a notary.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.250
This is Wang Pu's time to shine.

18:56.318 --> 18:57.003
Proceed.

18:57.253 --> 19:01.467
Madam Wu, we both love the enforcement
of pointless rules.

19:01.717 --> 19:04.468
But there's a greater joy in bending the rules

19:04.718 --> 19:07.717
to help someone who thinks all hope is gone.

19:09.556 --> 19:12.950
I was this woman's husband for a few days--

19:13.200 --> 19:16.929
in name only, and beer will soon
obliterate that memory--

19:17.179 --> 19:22.979
but I don't think this baby could find
any greater love on your planet or ours.

19:25.300 --> 19:28.453
You may not believe this, but I once was a baby myself.

19:28.703 --> 19:30.450
My father was a ping-pong champion.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.768
He died when the ball got stuck in his throat.

19:34.018 --> 19:37.503
The Heimlich maneuver was invented the very next day.

19:37.753 --> 19:41.467
My mother raised me alone, so I know it can be done.

19:41.717 --> 19:42.906
You may keep your baby.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.850
But you, drop the panda!

19:45.100 --> 19:46.900
But he loves me.

19:47.579 --> 19:48.750
Why you little...!

19:49.000 --> 19:50.350
I'll endanger you.

20:08.303 --> 20:10.303
Good-bye, Simpsons.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.268
You'll be back some day, Ling.

20:12.518 --> 20:15.068
As a spoiled American teenager.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.267
Something's wrong with Bart.

20:23.517 --> 20:24.706
He's acting weird.

20:24.956 --> 20:27.729
Feast on my shorts, stupid father man.

20:27.979 --> 20:30.050
Wait, you're not Bart.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.550
Close enough.

20:36.003 --> 20:39.750
American jerks are going home

20:40.300 --> 20:44.168
Now we sleep for a thousand years

20:44.418 --> 20:49.418
When we wake, the world will end.

20:54.079 --> 20:56.250
David Silverman here, supervising
director of The Simpsons,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.453
and tonight, I'm going to show
you how to draw Bart.

20:58.703 --> 21:01.250
Now, we start of with a tin can, like this,

21:01.500 --> 21:03.968
and a little tuna fish can for
the bottom part of his head.

21:04.218 --> 21:06.803
A little hinge of an ear,
and a big sausage for a nose.

21:07.053 --> 21:09.167
Two giant golf balls for eyes.

21:09.417 --> 21:10.906
Now, here's a trick about the hair--

21:11.156 --> 21:12.650
it's one, two, three, four,

21:12.900 --> 21:16.329
five, six, seven, eight, nine points.

21:16.579 --> 21:19.050
And, there you go.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.353
Perfect Barts every time.

21:20.603 --> 21:22.350
Now, once you've mastered how to draw Bart,

21:22.600 --> 21:24.668
you can put him in all sorts of costumes.

21:24.918 --> 21:26.203
Some that he likes.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.967
Some that he hates.

21:28.217 --> 21:29.606
Well, that's it, my friends.

21:29.856 --> 21:30.550
Thank you very much.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.846
Keep watching.
