03:27.473 --> 03:29.543
Why did you do that?

03:29.576 --> 03:31.845
We thought you were a prowler.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.780
Nice outfit, Mr. Twinkacetti.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.449
I have pajamas
that look like that.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.451
These are my pajamas.

03:38.484 --> 03:39.886
I spent the night here.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.755
My wife threw me out
just because I forgot

03:41.788 --> 03:43.557
our wedding anniversary.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.526
Well, you should be ashamed.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.561
You should be neutered.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.931
She threw you out?

03:50.964 --> 03:54.868
That's pretty severe for
missing one wedding anniversary.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.504
Well, actually, we've
been married 16 years

03:57.538 --> 03:59.806
and I've forgotten 16 of them.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.744

(Balki and Larry)
Hi, Mrs. Twinkacetti.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.692
Happy anniversary.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.764
Thank you, Balki.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.032
You're one up on him.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.934
I thought you'd be
needing a few things.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.504
Oh, that's very
thoughtful of you, dear.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.573
Can't we let
bygones be bygones?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.607

granted once too often.

04:40.947 --> 04:45.886
Ah, just for forgetting
one wedding anniversary

04:45.919 --> 04:48.321
sixteen times?

04:48.354 --> 04:49.790
It's not the anniversaries.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.091
And it's not the gambling

04:51.124 --> 04:52.859
and the wild nights

04:53.827 --> 04:56.362
Actually, it is that.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.971
Excuse me. I'll be in my office
looking for a reason to live.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.140
No, Mr. Twinkacetti,
you shouldn't be alone.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.375
Cousin, he needs
to be with friends.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.476
Yeah, good idea.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.811
Go see some friends.

05:46.947 --> 05:50.116
I can't do that.
All my friends know me.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.918
Well, we know you
and we're still your friends.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.887
‐ We are?
‐ And‐and you can stay with us.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.055
He can?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.790
You guys would let
me stay with you?

05:56.823 --> 05:57.991
I don't know what to say.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.527
Well, don't say
anything, uh, just yet.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.394
Why don't, why
don't you wait here?

06:01.427 --> 06:03.597
Balki, could I have
a word with you?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.901
Are you crazy?

06:07.934 --> 06:10.070
Cousin, Mr. Twinkacetti
is in pain.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.638
Well, how is making
my life a living hell

06:11.672 --> 06:14.074
going to change that?

06:14.107 --> 06:16.176
Well, somebody has got to let
him know that he's not alone

06:16.209 --> 06:18.044
that he's not a totally
worthless human being.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.813
You mean, somebody's
gotta lie to him.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.717
Balki, I feel as bad
about this as you do

06:23.750 --> 06:26.987
but I draw the line at having
the man sleep under my roof.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.022
Well, then, you tell
him he can't stay.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.491
Alright, I will.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.430
Mr. Twinkacetti?

Yes.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.073
Oh, say no more.

want me to stay with you.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.078

Godzilla for dinner.

Well, how are we going
to get poor Mr. Twinkacetti

07:35.221 --> 07:37.090
and poor Mrs. Twinkacetti
back together?

07:37.924 --> 07:39.760
We are not.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.195
Balki, rule of thumb.
Never butt in.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.030
It's not up to us
to save their marriage.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.766
‐ Just stay out of it.
‐ Yeah.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.138
I‐I see a marriage in trouble

07:52.172 --> 07:54.107
and I have to do
something to help.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.876
Well, just leave me out of it.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.714
Hi, boys. How's it going?

08:00.747 --> 08:01.982
I brought the beer.

08:03.083 --> 08:03.984
Come on in.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.755
You look like you
found a reason to live.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.990
Oh, yeah, I thought about it.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.792
Women. Who needs 'em?

08:11.825 --> 08:15.028
Especially since I got
great guy pals like you.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.797
How about a brewski?

08:16.830 --> 08:17.598
Oh, no, thank you.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.965
I got a pepski.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.542
You see, he's fine.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.011
Just leave them alone,
and they'll work things out.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.280
Cousin, no. He's hiding his
true feelings deep down inside.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.049
The man is shallow.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.019
There is no
deep down inside.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.623
Cousin, no.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.925
He's got something
inside him

08:44.958 --> 08:48.228
and it's going to‐to
fester and‐and swell

08:48.261 --> 08:50.296
and burst like
a tick on a sheepdog.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.235

Would you like
to share the pain

09:12.252 --> 09:14.054
that is going on
deep down inside?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.325
Nah!

What do you say we zip
around the old cable dial

Deep. Dee‐e‐ep.

Now, you know
what I think?

09:32.939 --> 09:35.041

deep down inside

09:35.075 --> 09:37.611
you know that if you
don't have Mrs. Twinkacetti

09:37.644 --> 09:39.279
you‐you got nothing.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.649
Oh, sure, you'll make
a life for yourself.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.050
But in the end

09:44.084 --> 09:47.087

newspapers under your shirt

he's not the same man.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.404
Well, yes,
he's still short.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.275
Tell her he's changing.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.745
I can't tell her that.
That would be lying.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.279
No, it's not. He's in
the bedroom changing.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.921
Mrs. Twinkacetti,
believe me when I tell you

12:00.954 --> 12:02.122
he's changing.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.192
You will? Yes,
I'll tell him.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.161
Yeah, bye.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.096
Balki, she's agreed
to talk to him.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.998
‐ Oh, that's wonderful.
‐ There's one catch.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.800
She'll only give
him five minutes.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.770
Personally, I think she'll
be out of there in three.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.272
Not if he can prove to her
that he's trying to change.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.241
Balki, take a reality pill.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.378
Mr. Twinkacetti is
not going to change.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.880
The best we can
hope for is that

12:26.913 --> 12:28.815
he can romance her
for five minutes.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.050
That way, he'll get
a foot in the door

12:30.083 --> 12:32.185
and out of our apartment.

12:32.218 --> 12:35.221
Appleton, I read your diary.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.190
You're a sick man.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.429
Mr. Twinkacetti,
that was personal.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.532
Hey, we're roomies.
We have no secrets.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.036
You never let me
read your diary.

12:53.507 --> 12:56.209
Why don't you tell
Mr. Twinkacetti the good news?

12:56.242 --> 12:57.210
Mr. Twinkacetti..

12:59.012 --> 13:01.481
...your wife has agreed to
talk to you for five minutes.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.483
Five minutes? What can
I do in five minutes?

13:03.517 --> 13:05.318
Well, I guess flying
her to Paris is out.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.459
You've got to prove to her
that you're going to change.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.595
Forget that.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.030
You've gotta crawl
before you can walk.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.365
And you can start
by being romantic.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.602
Now, we've gotta
find the right spot.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.503
Well, we used to go
to this restaurant.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.270
Oh, Tony's Mambo Room.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.575
"Tony's Mambo Room?"

13:28.609 --> 13:31.377
"Our ribs stick to your ribs."
That Tony's Mambo Room?

13:33.279 --> 13:35.616
I don't think
that's going to work.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.918
What are you talkin' about?
Tony's is a romantic place.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.352
You eat with your fingers.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.486
No.

13:40.521 --> 13:42.523
No, no, that's not romantic.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.357
That's disgusting.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.528
‐ That's cruel, Appleton.
‐ 'Okay.'

13:47.561 --> 13:49.195
Cousin Larry's right.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.397
We've seen you with
Mrs. Twinkacetti.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.366
It's not pretty.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.337
What am I gonna do? I don't
have a romantic bone in my body.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.239
Oh, you must
have had once.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.607
She fell in love with you.

14:00.641 --> 14:04.077
Sure, that was
13 years ago!

14:04.110 --> 14:05.111
(Balki and Larry)
Sixteen.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.312
See, I'm hopeless.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.448
No, no, no.
No, no, you're not.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.651
Alright, look, look.

14:10.684 --> 14:14.420
Let's make‐believe that
this is Tony's Mambo Room.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.223
Balki you are seeing
me for the first time

14:17.257 --> 14:19.292
since I kicked you out.

14:19.325 --> 14:20.393
This is how you have to act

14:20.426 --> 14:22.395
if you want to get
your wife back.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.980
Edwina...you look
lovely this evening.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.550
That dress brings out your eyes.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.220
I'm gonna throw up.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.490
Sit down, turnip.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.362
Donald, the Mambo Room.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.231
How sweet of
you to remember.

14:58.264 --> 15:01.034
How could I
forget, my pet?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.610
It seems like
only yesterday.

15:09.643 --> 15:12.112
You're as beautiful
as you were then.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.648
No, I'm wrong.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.718
‐ You're even more beautiful.
‐ I am?

15:17.751 --> 15:18.719
‐ You are.
‐ I am?

15:18.752 --> 15:19.720
‐ You are.
‐ I am?

15:19.753 --> 15:20.721
You...well,
of course, you are.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.422
Don't be ridiculous.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.329
Donald, I forgot how
romantic you could be.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.697
How could I ever
have kicked you out?

15:31.698 --> 15:33.433
Take me.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.137
I don't think so.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.472
‐ No, no, I'm just showing him‐‐
‐ No, I know what you're doing.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.074
‐ I know..
‐ No, I'm trying to..

15:41.107 --> 15:43.009
Do you get the general idea?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.511
I can't do this.

15:44.545 --> 15:48.014
Let's face it, we'll
be roomies for life.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.350
Alright, alright,
let's not panic.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.253
Look, we can do this.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.321
We put a man on the moon.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.389
We will go with you
to the restaurant

15:56.422 --> 15:58.158
and get you through this thing.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.626
Oh, you guys are the greatest.

15:59.660 --> 16:01.294
Well, we just wanna see you

16:01.327 --> 16:03.630
and Mrs. Twinkacetti
back together again

16:03.664 --> 16:05.465
in your own home.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.569
Did we really put
a man on the moon?

16:11.104 --> 16:13.073
Yes, we did.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.641
And get off my dress.

16:15.776 --> 16:18.512
[instrumental music]

16:27.554 --> 16:30.223
Now, remember,
compliment her clothes

16:30.256 --> 16:31.457
talk about her hair.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.559
Make her think
she's the most

16:32.593 --> 16:34.060
beautiful woman
in the world.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.329
No, Mr. Twinkacetti,
you've got to tell her

16:36.362 --> 16:38.064
the ways you are
going to change.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.499
Like what?

16:39.533 --> 16:42.068
Like, uh, you're
going to try harder

16:42.102 --> 16:43.436
to remember your anniversary.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.539
And you don't have to go
out so much with the boys.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.641
Look, you'll have
years to change.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.275
Right now you've
only got five minutes.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.211
Talk about her eyes.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.679
No, uh, Mr. Twinkacetti,
you've got to

16:52.713 --> 16:54.114
stop thinking
about yourself

16:54.147 --> 16:56.116
and start thinking
about Mrs. Twinkacetti.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.384
You should beg her forgiveness.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.154
You should throw
yourself down at her feet.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.524
You should press your
face up against her arches

17:03.557 --> 17:05.458
and tell her she can
step on your neck

17:05.491 --> 17:07.761
because you have not been
the man you should have been.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.366
What about her eyes?

17:15.101 --> 17:17.403
Tell her that
her eyes remind you

17:17.436 --> 17:19.839
of moonlit pools
on a summer night.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.808
She'll melt like butter.

17:21.842 --> 17:25.310
Alright, moonlit pools
on a warm summer night.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.079
‐ 'Here she is.'
‐ 'Alright.'

17:42.362 --> 17:44.598
Good evening, Donald.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.466
Hello, sugarplum,
won't you have a seat?

17:49.836 --> 17:52.773
‐ You know, sweetheart‐‐
‐ You've got five minutes.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.407
Go.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.878
Uh, my, don't you look
lovely this evening.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.445
You know, your eyes‐‐

17:59.479 --> 18:00.781
Hold the bull, Donald.

18:00.814 --> 18:03.584
Give me one good reason
why I should take you back.

18:03.617 --> 18:05.251
You want a reason?

18:05.285 --> 18:06.152
Don't you wanna
hear about your eyes?

18:06.186 --> 18:07.588
No.

18:07.621 --> 18:08.622
How am I doing on the time?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.290
I knew this wouldn't work.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.359
I'm trying to change.
Really, I am.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.629
Uh, why do you think
I chose this restaurant?

18:16.863 --> 18:17.664
I don't know.

18:17.698 --> 18:19.900
Why did you choose
this restaurant?

18:19.933 --> 18:24.671
Because I consider
the Mambo Room our place.

18:24.705 --> 18:27.173
But why? We've never
been here before.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.643
Oh, sure we have,
sweetness. Years ago.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.878
You don't remember, do you?

18:31.912 --> 18:33.880
I may not remember
wedding anniversaries

18:33.914 --> 18:36.750
but I do remember
the romantic stuff.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.585
We sat right in
that booth over there

18:38.619 --> 18:40.721
'and we necked all night.'

18:40.754 --> 18:45.425
I even slipped the accordion
player 50 cents to play

18:45.458 --> 18:47.327
"That's Why The Lady's A Tramp."

18:47.360 --> 18:48.294
[snaps fingers]

18:51.865 --> 18:53.900
Maybe that's because
the lady was a tramp.

18:53.934 --> 18:55.869
I've never been in this
restaurant in my life!

18:59.439 --> 19:03.544
You know, ahem, come to think
of it, uh, neither have I.

19:04.678 --> 19:06.680
Excuse me.
Nature calls.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.386
It's over.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.688
That was quick.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.257
I got the right restaurant,
but the wrong woman.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.626
'I used to bring dates here
before we were married.'

19:23.730 --> 19:26.199
Hello, Mrs. Twinkacetti.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.400
What brings you to Tony's?

19:27.433 --> 19:29.169
Not the ribs.

19:30.904 --> 19:34.675
You know, darling,
just now in the john

19:34.708 --> 19:37.410
I was thinking
about how your eyes

19:37.443 --> 19:42.482
remind me of, uh, moonlit
pools on a warm summer night.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.384
Stuff it, Donald!

19:44.417 --> 19:47.353
How could you bring me to
a place where you cheated on me?

19:47.387 --> 19:50.924
[gasps]
I never cheated on you
while we were married.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.459
I cheated on you
while we were engaged.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.761
Can't we talk?

19:55.996 --> 19:57.931
You talk to my lawyer.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.001
I still have two minutes.

20:01.034 --> 20:01.968
Uh..

20:03.737 --> 20:05.872
That's it. I guess that's it.

20:05.906 --> 20:08.341
Well, we're sorry
it didn't work out.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.576
Thanks a lot, guys.

20:09.610 --> 20:11.545
You did your best.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.479
And I want you to know
I really appreciate it.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.882
I'm going for a walk.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.784
You don't have
to wait up for me.

20:17.818 --> 20:19.319
I made a key.

20:24.858 --> 20:27.794
[instrumental music]

20:30.764 --> 20:33.333
I'm worried about
Mr. Twinkacetti.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.368
He don't come home last night.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.903
He could be
wandering the streets

20:36.937 --> 20:38.739
a‐a broken,
lonely little man.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.808
Now, at least I get
to sleep in my own bed.

20:43.043 --> 20:45.445
Oh, cousin,
he's our friend.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.948
"Our friend?"

20:47.981 --> 20:50.517
Balki, the man tried
to have you deported

20:50.551 --> 20:52.418
for giving the correct
change to a blind man.

20:56.657 --> 20:58.424
Well, I never said
he was a saint.

21:00.326 --> 21:03.463
Balki, you are the nicest
person I ever met.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.331
And I hope I never
get to be like you.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.736
Cousin, don't worry.
You won't.

21:13.807 --> 21:14.675
[thud]

21:18.579 --> 21:19.513
Mr. Twinkacetti?

21:22.883 --> 21:25.819
What are you bozos
doin' here so early?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.588
Mr. Twinkacetti,
you're alright.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.056
Ha..

21:34.928 --> 21:37.330
‐ Mrs. Twinkacetti.
‐ Hi, boys.

21:43.804 --> 21:45.539
Are you naked
under that coat?

21:50.043 --> 21:50.977
[Mr. Twinkacetti grunts]

21:53.547 --> 21:55.048
You're together?

21:55.849 --> 21:56.883
Yeah.

21:56.917 --> 21:58.018
After I left
the restaurant

21:58.051 --> 21:59.385
I got to thinking
about what you said

21:59.419 --> 22:00.754
about, you know,
being romantic and all

22:00.787 --> 22:02.523
and, uh..

22:02.556 --> 22:04.958
...then I
remembered what I did

22:04.991 --> 22:08.629
when I was trying to get
Edwina to fall in love with me.

22:08.662 --> 22:11.397
This crazy guy showed
up under my window

22:11.431 --> 22:15.101
with a big bag of egg
rolls and his saxophone.

22:15.135 --> 22:17.003
Egg rolls and saxophone.

22:17.037 --> 22:18.772
Why didn't we think of that?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.643
Then we came back here.

22:23.877 --> 22:25.411
You see, when
we were teenagers

22:25.445 --> 22:27.581
we used to steal
precious moments

22:27.614 --> 22:29.049
in the back of
my father's store

22:29.082 --> 22:30.784
so Donald thought
this would be

22:30.817 --> 22:33.520
a perfect place to
settle our differences.

22:33.554 --> 22:34.521
[chuckles]

22:34.555 --> 22:37.524
You big bag of romance.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.895
Why don't you boys
take the day off?

22:49.936 --> 22:51.471
Are you kidding?

22:51.505 --> 22:53.473
Who‐who‐who'd run the store?

22:53.507 --> 22:55.542
Well, maybe today the store
doesn't have to open.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.111
‐ Woof!
‐ Mmm!

23:01.014 --> 23:02.148
Edwina.

23:07.988 --> 23:10.891
Oh, thank you for all you did.

23:10.924 --> 23:12.826
I know there's a side of
Donald that you never see

23:12.859 --> 23:14.761
and I hadn't seen it
in a long time either

23:14.795 --> 23:17.163
but last night made me realize

23:17.197 --> 23:19.600
the Donald I fell in
love with is still there.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.469
After 16 years of marriage

23:23.504 --> 23:25.038
I'm not gonna give up on him.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.511
[instrumental music]

23:39.720 --> 23:43.690
Well, you said it‐it
don't help when you butt in.

23:43.724 --> 23:47.961
Okay, I was wrong,
you were right.

23:47.994 --> 23:52.498
I guess sometimes the only
way to help out is to butt in.

23:53.734 --> 23:56.670
[saxophone music]

24:05.846 --> 24:06.747
You hear that?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.783
That's the sound of love.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.554
Imagine what
hate sounds like.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.725
Well, you know
what they say.

24:18.759 --> 24:21.795
Even bad sax is better
than no sax at all.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.466
