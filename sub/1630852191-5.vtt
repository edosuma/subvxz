01:12.781 --> 01:14.074
A lot of people came.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.201
All of our guests are here.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.745
I can see
that you prepared a lot for this.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.538
Sir.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.571
Say hello.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.491
This is Jeong Hui-ju.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.409
This is Seo Woo-jae.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.792
Hello. I hope you like my work.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.338
Excuse us for a moment.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.306
Thank you for coming.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.058
Can I get an autograph?

02:36.865 --> 02:38.491
Did he recognize you?

02:43.663 --> 02:46.291
I thought he might get
his memory back once he saw you.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.751
I guess I was wrong.

02:51.629 --> 02:55.592
Since he can't recognize you,
I want you to play along.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.469
What are you talking about?

02:58.553 --> 03:01.431
He had an accident,
so he was unconscious for several years.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.892
He lost his memories after that.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.728
But he also lost some of his memories
before the accident.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.188
An accident?

03:10.315 --> 03:14.861
Yes. He's been stuck in Ireland
all these years because of the accident.

03:19.115 --> 03:23.161
Without a passport as
an unidentified illegal alien for years.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.541
Bringing him back to Korea
was quite difficult.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.294
I don't believe you.

03:31.377 --> 03:35.256
Exactly. It's hard to believe,
but that's what happened.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.931
I don't know why he was in Ireland,
so far away from here,

03:43.014 --> 03:45.558
and what on earth happened there.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.356
I hope he gets his memories back soon.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.610
I have tons of questions for him.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.822
But he's not able to answer
any of them yet,

03:59.906 --> 04:01.366
so it frustrates me too.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.333
Is it because of his memory loss?

04:11.167 --> 04:12.377
Isn't it fascinating?

04:13.378 --> 04:16.673
Woo-jae hasn't changed one bit.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.599
Right. Didn't you stay in Ireland as well?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.960
HYEON-SEONG

05:01.676 --> 05:02.593
Yes.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.889
Yes. I'm about to eat now.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.642
He's sleeping. Right now, the time is…

05:14.522 --> 05:15.732
What about you, honey?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.736
That's a relief. Is everything all right?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.030
Yes.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.199
Thank you.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.551
I came without any attachments,

05:44.719 --> 05:46.971
but why haven't you put anything aside?

05:48.556 --> 05:50.475
We don't have money.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.979
That's your favorite excuse.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.940
-I can make money--
-Sorry.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.068
I'll end it soon.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.121
Let's eat. Okay?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.983
<i>I wasn't lying.</i>

06:42.568 --> 06:44.695
<i>I did end it.</i>

07:27.989 --> 07:30.825
<i>All these years,
you didn't look for me. No, us.</i>

07:32.535 --> 07:36.038
<i>And I often wondered why you didn't.</i>

07:57.268 --> 08:00.438
<i>And an accident isn't
one of the reasons I imagined.</i>

08:16.537 --> 08:21.667
EPISODE 5
NOBODY LIED

08:24.462 --> 08:26.881
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.674
-Hi.
-This is the artist, Seo Woo-jae.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.760
I see. Nice to meet you.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.137
-I'm glad that you could make it.
-Of course.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.056
-How was it?
-I thought it was excellent.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.059
-Aren't you excited for his future works?
-Yes. Congratulations.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.352
I'll look forward to it.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.898
All of our guests love your exhibition.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.235
How did you keep his artwork
in such good condition?

08:47.318 --> 08:51.322
Be it artwork or human,
everything crumbles little by little

08:51.405 --> 08:53.324
if they're not cared for.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.744
If the damage became visible,
I wouldn't be able to fix it.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.373
So I checked on them whenever I had time.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.420
Are you all right?

09:08.339 --> 09:09.674
I'll go get some fresh air.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.551
Okay.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.729
Did Mr. Seo tell you about his father?

09:24.564 --> 09:25.523
Pardon?

09:26.857 --> 09:29.944
-No.
-He's talented just like his father.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.614
But luckily, his life doesn't seem
to be like his father's.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.411
Seeing how you two
care deeply about each other.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.862
Is this funny to you?

10:19.327 --> 10:21.287
So should I just play along with you?

10:21.370 --> 10:23.414
Then will that make our past go away?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.006
What is it that you want?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.181
Why are you doing this?

10:41.140 --> 10:44.518
Why? I should be the one asking you.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.855
Did you expect me to pass out in shock
when you showed up like this?

10:47.938 --> 10:48.939
Are you having fun?

10:50.733 --> 10:51.817
I think

10:53.194 --> 10:55.363
-you got the wrong--
-Are you kidding me?

10:55.446 --> 10:58.157
You still act like a kid
who doesn't know any better…

11:22.056 --> 11:23.224
Did I…

11:25.851 --> 11:27.770
do something wrong?

11:32.650 --> 11:33.776
You…

11:41.075 --> 11:42.159
Woo-jae.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.334
I appreciate you looking out for him.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.087
But Woo-jae isn't feeling well.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.883
If you have anything to say to him,
you can talk to me from now on.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.302
Let's go and get some rest, Woo-jae.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.401
DONG-MI'S EX, DETECTIVE PARK SANG-HYEON

12:59.320 --> 13:02.072
<i>There's not much
I can find out at this hour.</i>

13:02.156 --> 13:04.366
<i>It's confirmed that
he came back two months ago.</i>

13:04.450 --> 13:06.118
<i>And ever since he got back,</i>

13:06.202 --> 13:08.412
<i>he's been in Eunsung Nursing Hospital.</i>

14:48.470 --> 14:50.514
Yes. Hello.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.766
Who is this?

14:54.685 --> 14:55.603
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15:17.625 --> 15:18.751
Woo-jae?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.301
Is that you, Woo-jae?

15:29.345 --> 15:31.430
<i>I'm late, aren't I?</i>

15:33.682 --> 15:35.017
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15:36.018 --> 15:37.478
Sorry for what?

15:40.689 --> 15:42.650
For disappearing on me?

15:43.233 --> 15:46.487
Or for not calling me
over the past four years

15:46.570 --> 15:48.864
when you were alive and well?

15:50.741 --> 15:51.784
<i>For everything.</i>

15:54.912 --> 15:56.956
So you think sorry will cut it?

15:57.665 --> 15:59.875
<i>No. I'll tell you everything
once I get there.</i>

16:00.542 --> 16:03.712
<i>I will tell you everything
and apologize to you properly.</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:07.299
So you want me to wait for you again?
Where are you right now?

16:09.718 --> 16:10.886
<i>Hae-won.</i>

16:22.982 --> 16:24.191
If I wait for you,

16:27.486 --> 16:28.737
will you come?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.241
<i>I will.</i>

17:09.653 --> 17:12.114
<i>But you still didn't come after that call.</i>

17:12.197 --> 17:13.615
<i>I had to find you.</i>

17:40.309 --> 17:41.435
You're up.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.985
You strained yourself too much.
You should get some more sleep.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.363
How long do I have to stay here?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.324
You'll get discharged tomorrow.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.204
Should we just leave now then?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.955
We can do the paperwork tomorrow.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.083
But where do we go?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.168
What do you mean? Home, of course.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.461
Home?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.880
Yes. Our home.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.219
I'm sick of the hospital too.

18:29.691 --> 18:33.028
You wanted to live here a long time ago.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.905
Don't you remember?

18:36.824 --> 18:39.284
I guess I did if you say so.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.040
I had to look for this place in a rush
after finding you.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.834
So I haven't unpacked everything yet.

18:46.917 --> 18:51.004
Besides, I didn't want to stay here alone,
so I only moved in a few days ago.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.550
I'm sorry.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.097
I'm sorry

19:01.265 --> 19:02.516
for leaving you all alone.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.783
I haven't decided
where to put that up yet.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.910
Can you pick a spot?

19:26.623 --> 19:31.170
Did I tell you when we took that photo?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.565
<i>A 74-YEAR-OLD KOREAN MAN DIES
IN A HIT-AND-RUN</i>

19:51.648 --> 19:53.692
<i>KOREAN MAN IN HIS TWENTIES
CAUSES DEATH WHILE DUI IN IRELAND</i>

19:55.360 --> 19:56.695
<i>Did I…</i>

19:57.905 --> 19:59.740
do something wrong?

20:00.657 --> 20:03.702
<i>He's been stuck in Ireland
all these years because of the accident.</i>

20:04.620 --> 20:07.414
<i>I thought he might get
his memory back once he saw you.</i>

20:07.497 --> 20:08.832
<i>I guess I was wrong.</i>

20:09.833 --> 20:11.585
<i>A 74-YEAR-OLD KOREAN MAN DIES
IN A HIT-AND-RUN</i>

20:16.381 --> 20:17.299
Another all-nighter?

20:22.846 --> 20:24.431
You're working so hard.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.475
What is it?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.227
Let me borrow your car tomorrow.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.854
I need to replace the brake pads
due to the noise.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.398
I have to make many stops,
so taking cabs won't do.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.984
I need my car tomorrow morning.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.071
Use mine if you're not going far.
The pick-up is in the afternoon.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.824
Okay. Leave your car key
at the entrance before you go.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.285
Don't take both keys like you did before.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.245
Okay.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.497
-Good night.
-Good night.

21:09.559 --> 21:10.852
-Ho-su.
-No.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.106
It was even cut in half.
Just have one bite.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.233
I won't eat it.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.361
-How was it yesterday?
-What?

21:19.444 --> 21:21.863
You went to a party yesterday.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.866
Parties are all the same.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.868
You've been to my exhibition before.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.413
-Why do you ask?
-What was he like?

21:31.790 --> 21:33.166
I mean, the artist.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.422
I don't know much about him.
This is his first exhibition.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.966
I'm going to the exhibition too.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.052
I received a ticket for that.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.679
From whom?

21:46.263 --> 21:50.183
Mimi. She gave the tickets to Ju-yeong,
telling her to come with me.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.811
She said it was pretty good.
Do you think so too?

21:53.395 --> 21:54.938
-Don't go.
-Why not?

21:55.022 --> 21:57.691
I'm worried about you seeing her again.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.109
She apologized.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.986
Even so.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.864
What she did to you
mustn't be forgiven that easily.

22:11.538 --> 22:12.581
Let's sleep on it.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.375
No need. We decided to go this Friday.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.880
Sorry. I'm late.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.050
But I have to get going now.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.261
You can't be late
for our dinner tonight. Okay?

22:29.806 --> 22:31.683
I'm off now. Ho-su, eat a lot.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.102
-Are you done, Li-sa? Let's go.
-Okay.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.944
-Mom.
-Yes.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.823
Don't touch that. It's dirty.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.910
I'm sorry I threw up.

22:54.998 --> 22:56.166
No.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.086
Don't be sorry, Ho-su.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.505
You didn't do anything wrong.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.466
I'm sorry for raising my voice. Okay?

23:05.175 --> 23:06.843
You didn't do anything wrong, Ho-su.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.846
<i>He's been discharged.</i>

23:11.014 --> 23:12.516
The patient named Seo Woo-jae?

23:12.599 --> 23:14.267
Yes. He left yesterday.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.895
And his guardian came
to finish the paperwork today.

23:19.272 --> 23:22.484
Can you tell me why
Mr. Seo Woo-jae was admitted here?

23:22.567 --> 23:26.446
I can't give you his personal information
unless you're his guardian.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.199
She just left. You didn't see her?

23:39.626 --> 23:42.629
DESTINATIONS
EUNSEONG NURSING HOSPITAL

RICE MEAL

24:21.918 --> 24:23.170
I serve food too.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.715
I didn't change the sign yet.
I also serve food.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.265
-Sit wherever you like.
-Okay.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.277
AN HYEON-SEONG

24:53.658 --> 24:55.368
That bottle…

24:56.453 --> 24:59.456
This one? I'm keeping it
for another customer.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.791
That's my husband.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.585
A lot of people share the same name.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.463
Families don't share some stories.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.633
And in the afternoon,
I only serve drinks to my regulars.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.928
-I see.
-I saw that you drove here.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.473
I have delicious cabbage rolls
ready today. Just a minute.

25:16.556 --> 25:21.645
Then do you remember
who my husband came here with?

25:22.270 --> 25:25.273
He's not the type to drink at a bar alone.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.026
I picked up on this habit
while running a bar.

25:28.109 --> 25:31.863
I tend to forget what happens at my bar.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.323
That makes things easier.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.869
Excuse me.

25:42.707 --> 25:45.919
AN HYEON-SEONG

25:52.634 --> 25:54.719
<i>Hello, ma'am.
This is your husband's mechanic.</i>

25:54.803 --> 25:56.554
<i>Could I come around 2 p.m.?</i>

25:57.055 --> 25:59.849
Everything seems fine
from your electroencephalogram.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.310
Take a look at your head MRI scan.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.689
You'll see a 6mm lump right here.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.525
I suspect that it's an astrocytoma.

26:08.608 --> 26:11.361
But the lump is very small yet,
so it's hard to identify it.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.322
You can follow it up every six months.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.574
Then what's the cause for…

26:17.075 --> 26:19.452
Your brain was damaged
due to the accident.

26:19.536 --> 26:23.456
But I don't think it had anything to do
with your memory disorder.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.668
You don't seem to have
any cognitive impairments either.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.670
I came here because there's a problem.

26:29.504 --> 26:30.880
I want to find out why.

26:30.964 --> 26:34.968
Memory loss from traumas
usually improves in the first two years.

26:35.051 --> 26:38.013
But you missed that window,

26:38.096 --> 26:40.098
so I can't guarantee anything.

26:41.182 --> 26:44.144
Seeing how you're losing
memories before the accident,

26:45.103 --> 26:47.647
it's possible
that you have dissociative amnesia.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.567
So you're basically saying
there's nothing you can do.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.569
Isn't this a fancy way of saying that?

26:53.486 --> 26:54.529
Woo-jae.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.251
I'm sorry.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.545
He must be frustrated the most.

27:11.129 --> 27:14.215
He can see a psychiatrist at our hospital
if he's not seeing one.

27:14.299 --> 27:18.470
He's also showing symptoms of ataxia,
so he probably needs physical therapy too.

27:18.553 --> 27:21.723
Seeing all the doctors in one place
will be more convenient for him.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.475
Right. I was planning to do so.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.518
Then I'll see you at the next appointment.

27:27.687 --> 27:28.605
Doctor.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.567
He's asking me about the past.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.987
Sometimes, even I'm not sure
if what I remember is correct.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.365
Despite that,

27:39.824 --> 27:43.244
do you think I should tell him
how I remember it?

27:44.996 --> 27:48.208
Will he believe it even if it's not true?

27:50.251 --> 27:51.419
He will.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.550
<i>A certain part of his life is blank.</i>

27:58.176 --> 28:00.887
<i>It's very possible
to manipulate his memories</i>

28:00.970 --> 28:03.807
<i>by filling the blank
with the stories you tell him.</i>

28:10.772 --> 28:13.233
The slope of your left shoulder
is at ten degrees

28:13.316 --> 28:16.069
while the slope of your right one
is at 40 degrees.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.988
Which means
your right shoulder is the problem.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.491
Let's check your shoulder rotation.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.411
Make a fist and bend it at a right angle.

28:24.911 --> 28:28.289
Rotate it downward. Rotate it more.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.543
Hold on.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.588
Wait. I don't think
this is an accident-related injury.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.427
Did you injure your shoulder here
before the accident?

28:43.471 --> 28:45.348
All right. Let's take it slow.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.281
-Why?
-Wait.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.558
What brings you here?

29:29.726 --> 29:33.855
It's my housekeeper's day off,
but I have a lot of work to catch up on.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.067
-Are you leaving him with my mom?
-Yes.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.444
No hello for your aunt?

29:39.527 --> 29:41.279
Hello.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.619
Our physical therapy program is excellent.

29:47.702 --> 29:50.914
You'll get better if you follow through,
so don't get discouraged.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.457
Okay. Thank you.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.963
You need to get back to work.
Go ahead. I'll drop him off.

30:15.855 --> 30:19.400
Did we meet at the gallery the other day?

30:21.486 --> 30:23.905
-Yes.
-So we did.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.450
You looked familiar,
so I was trying to place you.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.915
But I don't think you fully remember me.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.917
I'm sorry.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.337
I've been like this these days.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.174
That must be tough.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.053
Yes. It's tough.

30:48.388 --> 30:52.100
Right. Did you want
to say something to me that day?

30:52.183 --> 30:54.853
No. There was a misunderstanding.
I'm sorry.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.480
It's okay.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.024
<i>First floor.</i>

31:12.954 --> 31:14.455
-Ms. Jeong.
-Hello, sir.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.292
-Yes?
-Neurosurgery had an outpatient named

31:17.375 --> 31:19.878
Seo Woo-jae today.
I'd like to see his medical records.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.796
Please. I need to see them.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.049
-Okay.
-Thank you.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.806
DOCTOR'S

31:32.390 --> 31:33.641
Thank you.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.190
What did you give her just now?

31:57.248 --> 32:00.919
<i>I chopped a lot of radishes that day,
so I dried them.</i>

32:01.002 --> 32:02.211
<i>Come and take some.</i>

32:22.649 --> 32:23.524
What?

32:24.400 --> 32:25.860
Hello.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.447
-You don't have an appointment today.
-Not me, but a friend.

32:29.530 --> 32:30.657
Who?

32:31.324 --> 32:33.117
Woo-jae. Seo Woo-jae.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.244
I see. Mr. Seo Woo-jae.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.248
He left about ten minutes ago.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.337
-He didn't wait for me?
-Pardon?

32:44.420 --> 32:47.632
I told him to wait.
I clearly told him to wait.

32:48.549 --> 32:50.802
Why don't you call him?

32:53.012 --> 32:55.932
Hold on. Let me call him.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.100
Just a second.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.502
He doesn't have a cell phone.

33:24.585 --> 33:27.630
His physical therapy went well,
so don't worry.

33:27.714 --> 33:28.881
Is that how I look?

33:31.092 --> 33:33.594
Does it look like I'm worried
and nervous to you?

33:34.804 --> 33:37.223
Does it look like
I'm making a fuss over nothing?

33:37.849 --> 33:38.933
No, I mean…

34:28.608 --> 34:30.026
You're still here?

34:37.325 --> 34:38.910
Are you okay?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.079
I couldn't find Hae-won.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.500
Did you try calling her?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.460
I don't have a cell phone.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.421
And I haven't memorized her number yet.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.054
I think you'll keep missing her
if you stay here.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.806
Why don't you wait for her at home?

34:59.889 --> 35:02.141
I went there for the first time yesterday.

35:03.059 --> 35:06.687
I mean, it felt like
I went there for the first time.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.191
I'm so pathetic.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.908
Well, get in.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.704
I know where you live, so get in.

36:14.463 --> 36:16.299
Why are you staring at me?

36:17.175 --> 36:18.426
You feel like a stranger.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.597
It's just hard to believe you are…

36:24.223 --> 36:25.600
the same person I knew.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.394
Did we know each other?

36:30.605 --> 36:33.107
I guess Hae-won didn't tell you about me.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.860
Like what?

36:37.320 --> 36:40.323
You two used to teach me how to draw.

36:41.657 --> 36:42.533
Pardon?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.624
You don't remember that either.

36:57.131 --> 37:00.551
The next request seems
to be even more precious.

37:00.635 --> 37:05.014
The next song was requested
by a listener. Here it is.

37:20.780 --> 37:24.116
But I remember
listening to this song a lot.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.466
You can draw this today.

39:37.666 --> 39:42.254
I feel really bad that
I keep relying on Hae-won.

39:42.797 --> 39:46.675
But she keeps telling me
that I'm a good person.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.513
I really want to be
a good person like she says,

39:51.055 --> 39:53.265
but how can someone always be good?

39:55.684 --> 39:57.311
I know best

39:58.145 --> 39:59.897
that I'm not a good person.

40:32.596 --> 40:33.639
Hey.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.434
I didn't know you came back home.
I kept looking for you.

40:43.691 --> 40:47.153
Where else would I go?
This is the only place for me to go.

40:50.531 --> 40:54.285
I'm glad that I waited for you at home
like Ms. Jeong suggested.

40:55.077 --> 40:56.370
If not, I would've been…

41:02.209 --> 41:06.046
I felt so stupid.
I couldn't remember your phone number.

41:07.214 --> 41:09.216
And I didn't know where our home was.

41:10.676 --> 41:13.345
The artist we met at the gallery
gave me a ride.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.515
Here?

41:17.349 --> 41:18.476
Yes.

41:20.936 --> 41:22.646
She has my phone number.

41:23.772 --> 41:25.774
Why didn't she just call me?

41:29.737 --> 41:31.363
But don't do that next time.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.033
Wait for me.

41:36.076 --> 41:38.037
Okay.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.164
I will.

41:42.541 --> 41:47.087
And it seemed that
Ms. Jeong and my doctor know each other.

41:48.172 --> 41:52.426
I heard her son calling my doctor Auntie.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.055
Her son?

41:56.972 --> 41:57.806
Yes.

41:59.725 --> 42:00.768
He's cute.

42:01.769 --> 42:04.396
It was cute how he was staring at me.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.451
I don't have anyone to call but you.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.246
Exactly. Getting you a phone
will make things easier for me.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.456
-Hello.
-We're here to sign up for a new phone.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.958
Sure. This way, please.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.462
I'll help you fill out these boxes
and go over the plan with you.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.232
Why did you buy so much food?

42:48.315 --> 42:50.109
I'm preparing dinner today.

42:50.192 --> 42:53.779
The director of the gallery that's holding
my exhibition is coming over.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.160
Do you have something to tell me?

43:00.744 --> 43:04.123
You saw my patient this afternoon
at the hospital.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.124
Mr. Seo Woo-jae.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.337
So you do know him.

43:13.507 --> 43:14.592
Yes.

43:15.801 --> 43:19.054
I heard he lost some of his memories
due to an accident.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.639
He'll get better, right?

43:22.725 --> 43:26.520
I'm not sure how much progress he'll make,

43:26.604 --> 43:28.731
but his wife really wants him
to get better.

43:28.814 --> 43:31.066
So she's probably doing
everything she can.

43:34.820 --> 43:37.072
-Have a nice dinner then.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.375

45:11.875 --> 45:13.335
She should've run a restaurant.

45:18.966 --> 45:22.845
Maybe it's because I'm such a horrible
cook, but I'm curious, Ms. Jeong.

45:22.928 --> 45:24.596
How are you good at everything?

45:24.680 --> 45:26.348
I couldn't have done it by myself.

45:26.432 --> 45:28.267
I've had help from my husband.

45:32.146 --> 45:35.190
Exactly. What good is it
if you have no one to share your skills?

45:35.274 --> 45:38.986
And your marriage can survive

45:39.862 --> 45:41.071
Mom.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.824
Mother, the director wanted
to treat you to a meal

45:43.907 --> 45:45.617
for purchasing an art piece,

45:45.701 --> 45:48.787
but I invited her over for dinner instead
to thank her.

45:49.621 --> 45:52.833
Thank you for purchasing
from the gallery again, ma'am.

45:53.542 --> 45:56.712
Well, I bought it because I heard
I could reduce taxes that way.

45:56.795 --> 45:58.297
I don't know much about art.

45:59.047 --> 46:00.966
I find modern art even more perplexing.

46:01.842 --> 46:04.303
They bring some garbage and call it art.

46:04.386 --> 46:05.387
I don't get it.

46:05.471 --> 46:07.431
But it will be very expensive garbage.

46:07.931 --> 46:11.768
The price of the artwork you purchased
will go up several times in five years

46:11.852 --> 46:13.312
if the artist takes off.

46:13.395 --> 46:14.771
Can you guarantee that?

46:14.855 --> 46:18.567
Yes. My job is
to increase an artist's value

46:18.650 --> 46:20.569
and guarantee such growth.

46:21.278 --> 46:24.531
Then do you think
her art will sell well too?

46:25.741 --> 46:28.202
-We spent a lot of--
-This isn't a business deal.

46:28.285 --> 46:31.038
-Let's not talk about money.
-I wasn't done talking.

46:31.121 --> 46:32.831
Is cutting me off fun for you?

46:38.086 --> 46:39.505
I'll go and check.

46:39.588 --> 46:40.547
Okay.

46:44.176 --> 46:47.179
Ms. Jeong's pieces already sell well.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.389
She always sells all of her pieces.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.934
We don't know
how much the value will go up,

46:52.017 --> 46:55.354
so if we could, we'd like to keep
her artwork for three years at least.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.491
Hui-ju, were you having dinner?

47:10.244 --> 47:12.287
How dare you show up here again?

47:12.371 --> 47:14.289
You came to my house too.

47:18.085 --> 47:21.588
Thank you for driving Woo-jae home.

47:23.799 --> 47:26.635
-Take it. I want to show my appreciation.
-What's going on?

47:28.303 --> 47:29.471
It's a package.

47:48.323 --> 47:49.366
Hae-won.

48:05.257 --> 48:07.342

Should we sit down for a bit?

48:07.426 --> 48:08.635
Sure.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.315
This is nice.

48:22.649 --> 48:25.068
Walking and talking with you.

48:30.699 --> 48:32.576
have all become special to me.

48:33.243 --> 48:34.953
So I like ordinary things like this.

48:38.665 --> 48:40.667
You haven't changed one bit,

48:41.585 --> 48:43.795
so I feel weird when I look at you.

48:45.714 --> 48:47.049
You haven't changed either.

48:48.925 --> 48:50.218
No.

48:51.887 --> 48:55.057
I've gone through all the days
that you skipped.

48:57.267 --> 48:59.728
Our lives have been so different
during those days.

49:06.526 --> 49:08.862
Then you can fill my days.

49:10.614 --> 49:12.074
So we can be on the same path.

49:22.501 --> 49:23.585
Right.

49:24.419 --> 49:27.506
I heard I taught Ms. Jeong how to draw.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.426
Is that what she said?

49:32.386 --> 49:34.638
Yes. She told me when she dropped me off.

49:35.138 --> 49:36.223
That's not true.

49:38.016 --> 49:40.227
You didn't teach her. I did.

49:40.310 --> 49:41.687
You just filled in for me.

49:42.312 --> 49:43.689
When my grandpa was injured,

49:43.772 --> 49:46.191
you subbed for me.
It was only for a brief time.

49:46.274 --> 49:48.568
She implied that
I taught her for a long time.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.987
She liked you.

49:52.489 --> 49:55.283
She kept asking you
to give her more lessons.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.745
But you said no.

50:00.539 --> 50:01.498
I did?

50:02.791 --> 50:05.836
I was busy then preparing
for my senior portfolio and to go abroad.

50:07.379 --> 50:09.548
So I wanted you to take over.

50:13.135 --> 50:17.222
But you were
quite uncomfortable around Hui-ju.

50:27.065 --> 50:28.608
<i>That's not a lie.</i>

50:33.530 --> 50:36.241
Woo-jae! We can apply
for the visa as spouses.

50:39.953 --> 50:43.623
We just have to translate these documents.
What was that called?

50:43.707 --> 50:45.542
Right. Apostilles.

50:45.625 --> 50:48.128
We just have to get them notarized
and submit them.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.633
Since we're going there as spouses,
we need a marriage certificate.

50:54.217 --> 50:56.011
So as long as we take care of that…

50:56.094 --> 50:57.387
You want to get married?

50:58.472 --> 50:59.931
We were going to anyway.

51:00.515 --> 51:04.686
For the initial funds,
we will need about 15 to 20 million won.

51:04.770 --> 51:07.439
The money I saved from my jobs,
the deposit on my studio,

51:07.522 --> 51:09.524
and the rent from this place
will be enough.

51:09.608 --> 51:12.569
And in Germany, we can have part-time jobs
with student visas,

51:12.652 --> 51:13.862
so if we need more--

51:13.945 --> 51:15.989
Must we do all that,
just so I can join you?

51:16.698 --> 51:20.577
Yes, we must.
I don't think I can do this without you.

51:21.286 --> 51:23.497
-You've been helping me with--
-It was all you.

51:24.664 --> 51:26.291
I only watched you.

51:26.374 --> 51:28.210
So you should keep watching me.

51:29.294 --> 51:33.548
Hui-ju wants to take lessons from you
since I'll be busy preparing to go abroad.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.343
-With the fees from her, we--
-I won't do it.

51:37.219 --> 51:39.054
-What?
-Tell her I won't.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.099
Why not? That's
a lot of money for a month.

51:49.314 --> 51:52.943
I'll figure something out
to get enough money for us.

51:55.570 --> 51:57.280
But I feel uncomfortable going abroad

51:58.323 --> 51:59.533
with her money.

52:01.660 --> 52:04.162
<i>It was true
that he was uncomfortable with her.</i>

52:24.266 --> 52:28.186
<i>After Woo-jae saw your son,
he kept saying how adorable your son was.</i>

52:28.728 --> 52:30.939
<i>I figured you have everything you need,</i>

52:31.022 --> 52:32.566
<i>so I'm sending a gift for Ho-su.</i>

52:45.871 --> 52:48.623
Darn it. Why won't she pick up?

52:52.210 --> 52:54.629
You've gone mad.
You finally lost it, didn't you?

52:55.297 --> 52:58.508
Sir, give me a cold glass of water.

53:08.602 --> 53:12.230
Haven't you learned anything?
How can you get back together with him?

53:12.814 --> 53:15.942
I didn't get back together with him.
Legally, we never broke up.

53:17.319 --> 53:19.654
-You're married?
-Exactly.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.948
She registered her marriage
when she was young.

53:22.032 --> 53:23.366
So shockingly, she's married.

53:24.409 --> 53:25.827
He ditched you and your plan.

53:25.911 --> 53:28.705
So you guys broke up long ago.
But what? You never broke up?

53:28.788 --> 53:30.415
Unbelievable.

53:30.498 --> 53:32.709
Hey, let me see that jerk's face.

53:32.792 --> 53:34.294
Let's see how shameless he is.

53:34.377 --> 53:36.546
-You've never met him?
-Exactly!

53:36.630 --> 53:37.756
He ruined her life!

53:37.839 --> 53:40.842
Grinding his tongue on asphalt
won't be enough to satisfy me.

53:44.095 --> 53:45.305
He had an accident.

53:45.388 --> 53:46.806
What?

53:47.682 --> 53:49.559
He didn't disappear on me.

53:51.144 --> 53:52.395
He had an accident.

53:52.479 --> 53:55.732
Even so. How could he ghost you
for several years?

53:55.815 --> 53:58.151
Hey, that's an excuse.

53:58.652 --> 54:01.488
He was unconscious for years.

54:01.988 --> 54:03.949
He couldn't have called even if he wanted.

54:04.032 --> 54:07.452
Goodness. You fool. Did you buy that?

54:07.535 --> 54:12.582
Goodness. How could a daughter of mine
be so foolish? Oh, dear.

54:19.172 --> 54:21.257
So? What's your plan?

54:21.341 --> 54:23.885
You'll look after that jerk
and waste your life again?

54:26.137 --> 54:27.430
I want to do

54:29.265 --> 54:30.976
the things I never got to do

54:31.935 --> 54:33.520
and the things I should have done.

54:38.191 --> 54:40.402
I'm the only one
he remembers from his past.

54:42.654 --> 54:45.031
All of the things that I missed out on,

54:46.157 --> 54:47.283
I'll do them.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.287
I will put everything…

54:53.248 --> 54:54.791
back in its rightful place.

55:02.549 --> 55:05.635
<i>THE MEANING OF SILENCE,
FROM DRAWING TO CARVING</i>

55:16.021 --> 55:18.815
I'm sure she invited you here
for a reason.

55:18.898 --> 55:21.276
Take your time.
I'll wait for you at the cafe.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.262
I'm so envious.

55:49.888 --> 55:50.722
Let's go.

55:53.433 --> 55:55.101
Are you here to see the director?

55:57.062 --> 55:58.480
That's one of the reasons.

55:59.397 --> 56:01.566
You don't usually come in.

56:01.649 --> 56:03.568
All my interviews were scheduled today.

56:06.404 --> 56:09.240
I see. What about Hae-won?

56:09.824 --> 56:11.284
She's feeling under the weather.

56:11.367 --> 56:15.455
I wanted her to rest at home,
so I put her to sleep and left quietly.

56:16.539 --> 56:19.501
She must have had a lot on her plate
because of me lately,

56:19.584 --> 56:21.419
but she never shows it.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.379
And then, her body breaks down.

56:23.463 --> 56:25.507
You must've had a lot of interviews.

56:26.341 --> 56:27.759
I was surprised.

56:27.842 --> 56:30.929
From what I remember, you had
a hard time even showcasing your art.

56:31.012 --> 56:33.139
Maybe it's because I wasted a few years.

56:34.557 --> 56:35.934
I want my career to take off.

56:36.726 --> 56:39.020
I want to be successful just like you.

56:40.605 --> 56:42.524
Hae-won went through a lot all alone.

56:43.149 --> 56:44.901
I want to make it up to her somehow.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.947
She must be so happy to hear that.

56:49.030 --> 56:50.615
All right, then.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.086
I'm also headed that way.

57:13.596 --> 57:15.306
What would you like?

57:15.390 --> 57:16.724
-Lemonade…
-Lemonade…

57:19.227 --> 57:20.145
And the syrup?

57:20.228 --> 57:21.688
-Half a pump…
-Half a pump…

57:24.023 --> 57:24.858
Mom.

57:27.485 --> 57:28.486
Hey.

57:39.581 --> 57:41.749
Why did you come out so soon?

57:42.333 --> 57:44.169
-Li-sa--
-It's boring.

57:46.087 --> 57:49.132
I don't get it. And it's eerie to look at.

57:49.966 --> 57:51.676
Why did she want us to see this?

57:52.260 --> 57:54.220
-Li-sa.
-Who's this guy?

57:55.930 --> 57:58.516
-I--
-The artist of the exhibit you badmouthed.

57:59.350 --> 58:00.393
I see.

58:03.354 --> 58:06.149
By the way, you're so handsome.
You look like a model.

58:06.232 --> 58:08.026
-Hey.
-He is handsome.

58:08.109 --> 58:09.486
You ogled at him too.

58:11.070 --> 58:12.864
-Where are you going?
-The restroom.

58:18.620 --> 58:19.704
Can we take a photo?

58:19.787 --> 58:22.415
And can I upload the photo
on my social media?

58:22.499 --> 58:24.375
He doesn't like taking photos--

58:24.459 --> 58:25.460
Sure.

58:34.969 --> 58:36.262
<i>He's someone else.</i>

58:37.096 --> 58:38.306
PROMO: ART BOOK, FREE SHIPPING

58:38.389 --> 58:41.267
<i>You're not the Seo Woo-jae I knew.</i>

59:19.222 --> 59:20.765
What's Li-sa doing?

59:22.058 --> 59:23.142
She's sleeping.

59:24.394 --> 59:27.480
When will Ms. Gu's
disciplinary action be settled?

59:28.690 --> 59:30.400
Look how much Li-sa changed.

59:30.483 --> 59:32.652
Isn't Ms. Gu responsible for it?

59:32.735 --> 59:34.862
It'll be done soon. Don't worry.

59:34.946 --> 59:36.573
I'm worried, so do it quickly.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.909
I don't want you or Li-sa
to see her in private.

59:41.286 --> 59:43.705
If my relationship with Li-sa gets worse…

59:54.007 --> 59:58.511
It's not easy
for a child to hate a parent.

1:00:02.223 --> 1:00:04.309
She just needs some time now.

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:09.689
Sometimes, I think about my father.

1:00:13.610 --> 1:00:15.528
He didn't do it often,

1:00:15.612 --> 1:00:18.990
but he told me some loving words
and showed me warmth.

1:00:22.201 --> 1:00:25.455
There are times when I miss them utterly.

1:00:26.164 --> 1:00:29.083
Then I feel regrettable and guilty.

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:35.673
I loathed my father,
but even I miss him at times.

1:00:40.136 --> 1:00:41.429
Li-sa is lucky.

1:00:44.807 --> 1:00:46.392
To have a dad like you.

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:38.569
That junk car stalled
on top of the bridge.

1:01:44.158 --> 1:01:46.494
You walked home from the bridge
in this weather?

1:01:46.577 --> 1:01:48.955
What could I do?
I couldn't call anyone for help.

1:02:08.725 --> 1:02:11.811
I really hate hearing useless sounds.

1:02:12.311 --> 1:02:14.188
The creaking sound of misaligned windows.

1:02:14.856 --> 1:02:18.192
The rattling sound of the fridge.
The sound of coughs from next door.

1:02:20.528 --> 1:02:22.780
Why don't you try drawing those sounds?

1:02:26.951 --> 1:02:29.871
As you do, they'll grow on you.

1:02:31.330 --> 1:02:34.876
I don't want to love such sounds.
I'm so sick of them.

1:03:13.831 --> 1:03:17.335
JEONG HUI-JU

1:03:24.217 --> 1:03:27.345
JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

1:03:27.428 --> 1:03:29.806
-Thank you for coming.
-It was a nice exhibition.

1:03:30.473 --> 1:03:33.184
Gosh. Thank you for inviting me.

1:03:33.267 --> 1:03:34.936
It was my pleasure.

1:03:36.103 --> 1:03:37.772
Honey. Congratulations.

1:03:39.023 --> 1:03:41.234
I know you worked hard for this.

1:03:45.404 --> 1:03:48.366
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1:03:48.950 --> 1:03:50.993
-You came. Thank you.
-Congratulations.

1:03:54.163 --> 1:03:55.289
Hui-ju.

1:04:20.147 --> 1:04:21.315
Congratulations.

1:04:21.941 --> 1:04:25.570
I'm so happy to see that
you've become such a successful artist.

1:04:27.572 --> 1:04:28.906
I mean it.

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:37.248
Hello. Nice seeing you here.

1:04:47.758 --> 1:04:50.678
It's been a while. How have you been?

1:05:50.237 --> 1:05:53.741
AN HYEON-SEONG

1:06:09.715 --> 1:06:11.217
<i>Where is Woo-jae?</i>

1:06:11.300 --> 1:06:13.928
<i>He is long gone.</i>

1:06:14.762 --> 1:06:17.139
<i>What were you and Ms. Gu
talking about back there?</i>

1:06:20.893 --> 1:06:22.979
<i>Don't you ever approach my family again.</i>

1:06:23.062 --> 1:06:24.605
But why did you?

1:06:27.233 --> 1:06:28.901
<i>I can't trust myself.</i>

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:32.446
<i>I feel like I did something awful to her.</i>

1:06:32.530 --> 1:06:34.532
<i>You never had any respect for me.</i>

1:06:35.408 --> 1:06:36.575
Are you trying to get revenge?

1:06:36.659 --> 1:06:38.244
<i>I'm giving you a warning.</i>

1:06:38.327 --> 1:06:40.454
<i>I won't sit still this time.</i>

1:06:41.372 --> 1:06:44.375
<i>Did I run away from you?</i>
