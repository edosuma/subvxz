00:02.128 --> 00:03.838
<i>Eugene, where are you?</i>

00:03.922 --> 00:05.465
<i>I need you.</i>

00:05.548 --> 00:07.509
<i>Please. Come now.</i>

00:33.993 --> 00:35.078
Lock the door.

00:47.674 --> 00:48.925
Tracy, what's wrong?
What happened?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.011
He cheated on me!

00:54.305 --> 00:57.559
Jenny Lewin saw
him getting head under the bleachers

00:57.642 --> 00:59.561
from Karen freakin' Murphy.

01:00.937 --> 01:02.731
She's a five at best.

01:03.648 --> 01:04.983
Jenny Lewin hates me.

01:05.066 --> 01:08.236
She's gonna tell everyone
that Tucker cheated on me with a five!

01:08.319 --> 01:10.029
I'll be humiliated.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.490
So...

01:15.410 --> 01:17.412
I'm going to kill myself.

01:18.121 --> 01:20.081
It's my dad's
and it's loaded.

01:20.165 --> 01:22.041
Wait. Why don't you put that
down before somebody gets hurt.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.210
I'm killing myself, Eugene.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.672
I already wrote
my suicide note.

01:37.515 --> 01:40.310
"To whom it may concern,

01:40.393 --> 01:42.353
"Dear everybody,
my death has nothing

01:42.479 --> 01:44.439
"to do with that
asshole Tucker."

01:47.233 --> 01:49.944
"I hereby leave
Buckeroo to Suzy K,

01:50.028 --> 01:52.655
"my only friend
who cared enough to bring him carrots.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.784
"The rest of my stuff
should be kept exactly where it is,

01:55.867 --> 01:56.826
"like a shrine,

01:56.910 --> 01:58.369
"so people can
come remember me.

01:59.329 --> 02:03.291
"Under no circumstances
are my brothers ever allowed in my room.

02:05.835 --> 02:06.961
"For Tucker,

02:08.046 --> 02:10.256
"I leave a list
of all the guys I've had really great sex with

02:10.340 --> 02:11.966
"so he can be jealous
for all eternity.

02:13.468 --> 02:18.598
"Greg,
Houston, Cody H, Cody D..."

02:21.559 --> 02:22.852
"Cody D"?

02:24.103 --> 02:27.941
Well, it was just anal
so I'll still get into heaven.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.236
The part about
you is at the end.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.784
"I officially put
my most trusted friend,

02:40.245 --> 02:42.664
"Eugene Root,

02:43.665 --> 02:45.333
"in charge of everything
in this letter."

02:47.585 --> 02:50.088
My funeral playlist
is on page 14.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.798
Make sure they bury
me in that dress.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.509
Look... I'm sorry, Tracy,
but I'm not gonna help you with this.

02:54.592 --> 02:55.593
No way.

02:55.677 --> 02:57.053
You have to.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.764
You're the only person
I can count on to do what I say.

02:59.848 --> 03:03.059
Look, I know this hurts.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.770
But dying is not the answer.

03:06.271 --> 03:07.397
Living is.

03:07.939 --> 03:09.107
Look, Trace,
God would not want you

03:09.190 --> 03:10.942
to give up on
yourself just 'cause...

03:11.693 --> 03:14.529
Just 'cause Jenny Lewin's
got a big mouth.

03:15.989 --> 03:17.365
He's probably got a miracle
waiting for you,

03:17.448 --> 03:19.450
right around the corner.

03:20.118 --> 03:21.619
The thing is,

03:23.288 --> 03:25.331
you gotta stick around
if you want to see it.

03:29.127 --> 03:32.839
It's like what Mary Poppins
says in <i>The Sound of Music,</i>

03:32.922 --> 03:37.093
that when God closes a door,
He always opens up a window.

03:40.138 --> 03:41.180
You're right.

03:42.015 --> 03:44.142
I used to love
<i>Mary Poppins.</i>

03:54.694 --> 03:56.821
We won't need this anymore.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.296
Thanks, Eugene.

04:32.941 --> 04:34.317
What the heck?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.277
I'm... I'm sorry.
I just... I just thought that...

04:36.361 --> 04:39.489
You thought that
because me and Tucker, that...

04:39.572 --> 04:40.907
You and me?

04:44.619 --> 04:45.912
Maybe.

04:51.209 --> 04:52.210
Ew.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.799
- Oh, God.
- No!

05:12.230 --> 05:13.523
Darn it.

05:15.024 --> 05:17.151
Tracy? Oh, thank gosh.

05:17.235 --> 05:18.820
I'm so sorry.
Please, do not die.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.365
I'mma get all
this back in here.

05:23.908 --> 05:26.703
Then you'll be good as new,
all right? It really looks a lot worse than it is.

05:27.412 --> 05:28.871
Let's scoop this stuff back
where it belongs.

05:28.955 --> 05:31.082
Please don't die, Tracy.
Please don't die.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.252
Hello?

05:34.335 --> 05:35.503
Tracy?

05:36.379 --> 05:37.422
Tracy?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.424
Hey, Mrs. Loach,
be out in just a second.

05:39.841 --> 05:41.342
Okay, Eugene.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.345
Why is this door locked?

05:44.429 --> 05:45.513
Be out in just a minute.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.932
Tracy, you know the rules.
Unlock this door.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.893
What's going on
in there, Eugene?

05:50.977 --> 05:53.438
Uh, Tracy's taking a nap,
Mrs. Loach.

05:54.147 --> 05:55.940
We'll be out in just a...
Just a minute.

05:56.274 --> 05:57.734
Tracy, honey, are you okay?

05:58.359 --> 05:59.777
What's he doing to you?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.196
Eugene, open this door
right now

06:02.280 --> 06:05.533
or you're gonna be
in big trouble. I mean it Eugene Root.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.494
Open this door
or I'm calling your father!

06:09.454 --> 06:11.497
Please don't do that,
Mrs. Loach.

06:11.581 --> 06:12.790
Tracy?

06:13.583 --> 06:14.709
Tracy.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.961
Eugene, you leave
my daughter alone.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.505
Eugene,
you answer me right now.

06:19.589 --> 06:20.590
You monster!

06:26.637 --> 06:29.140
You get your hands
off my daughter, Eugene.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.225
I'm calling your father
right now.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.687
Eugene! Eugene!

06:44.322 --> 06:46.032
<i>Eugene, where are you?</i>

06:46.115 --> 06:48.076
<i>I need you.
I need you.</i>

06:48.159 --> 06:50.495
<i>Please. Come now.</i>

06:52.955 --> 06:53.956
Lock the door.

06:54.624 --> 06:55.958
He cheated on me!

06:56.042 --> 06:57.085
I'm going to kill myself.

06:57.168 --> 06:58.669
I'm sorry, Tracy,
but I'm not gonna help you with this.

06:58.753 --> 07:00.171
Dying is not the answer.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.297
Living is.

07:05.510 --> 07:06.511
Ew.

07:06.803 --> 07:07.804
No!

07:08.971 --> 07:10.681
It really looks
a lot worse than it is.

07:11.307 --> 07:12.391
Hello?

07:12.475 --> 07:13.601
Tracy?

07:18.022 --> 07:19.607
<i>Eugene, where are you?</i>

07:20.525 --> 07:21.484
Lock the door.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.777
It's my dad's
and it's loaded.

07:22.860 --> 07:23.945
Dying is not the answer.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.321
<i>Living is.</i>

07:26.697 --> 07:28.074
Please don't die.
Oh, God.

07:30.743 --> 07:31.744
You and me?

07:33.621 --> 07:34.622
Ew.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.208
Ew.

08:12.076 --> 08:15.538
All units down
in block 3767211.

08:20.585 --> 08:21.752
Don't move.

09:38.663 --> 09:40.831
I just think New Orleans
is a dumb idea.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.708
Got a better one?

09:42.792 --> 09:44.001
NOLA's great.

09:44.085 --> 09:47.171
Ladies flash their boobs
at practically nothing out there.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.800
If you like
that sort of thing. I don't.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.427
Are we gonna have to listen
to this one song

09:53.511 --> 09:54.762
over and over
the whole drive?

09:55.346 --> 09:57.807
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.851
Tammy said <i>A Walk To The Peak</i>
was God's favorite.

10:02.353 --> 10:03.729
It is kinda catchy.

10:03.813 --> 10:04.939
Yeah.

10:05.022 --> 10:09.694
Like cats screwing
at the airport under an ice-cream truck.

10:09.777 --> 10:10.778
Hmm.

10:11.696 --> 10:13.239
I thought you hated
New Orleans.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.116
I like the city fine.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.201
It's the swamps I don't like.

10:17.868 --> 10:18.869
Why's that?

10:18.953 --> 10:20.788
It's a family thing.
You want me to drive?

10:20.871 --> 10:21.956
My car?

10:22.039 --> 10:23.040
No.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.293
Why?

10:25.376 --> 10:27.128
You're driving
like a little boy.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.379
- No, I'm not.
- You're goin' 50.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.965
That's the legal
speed limit, Jesse.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.717
I just think New Orleans
is a dumb plan.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.218
So I heard.

10:34.302 --> 10:35.845
All's we know is that
God has a crappy taste in music.

10:35.928 --> 10:36.929
I like jazz.

10:37.388 --> 10:39.307
I like tacos, doesn't mean
I go to Mexico.

10:39.390 --> 10:40.599
You have gone to Mexico.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.351
I didn't go to Mexico
for the tacos, Jesse.

10:42.435 --> 10:43.853
I went to kill a guy.
That's my point.

10:43.936 --> 10:44.979
Do you know what, though?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.772
I could really go for
a Mexican taco right now.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.899
But you don't have
to go to Mexico for one, Cassidy!

10:49.025 --> 10:51.444
Lots of places have
Mexican tacos.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.239
Just like there's lots
of jazz in Mexico.

10:55.323 --> 10:56.365
Mexi-jazz.

10:56.449 --> 10:57.700
Exactly.

10:58.576 --> 11:00.286
I think we probably
should go to Mexico.

11:00.411 --> 11:02.204
'Cause maybe God
likes Mexi-jazz?

11:02.288 --> 11:03.289
Well, maybe.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.840
Well, I got a good feeling
about New Orleans.

11:35.780 --> 11:36.906
Do you have any idea

11:36.989 --> 11:39.950
how many jazz clubs there are
in New Orleans, Jesse?

11:40.034 --> 11:42.453
A hundred and eighty-seven.
I looked it up.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.747
So, where do we start,
Padre?

11:45.664 --> 11:47.041
How about right here?

11:50.252 --> 11:51.712
Excuse me.

11:51.796 --> 11:52.963
Hey.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.010
Lookin' for God.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.180
All three of ya?

12:04.141 --> 12:05.267
Yeah.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.269
Cover me.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.248
These folks are
looking for God.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.918
All three of them?

12:31.919 --> 12:33.003
Yeah.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.840
Follow me.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.413
These folks are
looking for God.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.707
All three of us.

14:11.268 --> 14:15.189
So, $1,800 to watch,
$4,000 if you want to play.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.650
And doggy style is $12,000.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.568
Wow.

14:20.861 --> 14:21.904
That's different.

14:23.614 --> 14:24.782
What'll it be?

14:26.116 --> 14:27.117
Right.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.371
The hell are you doing?

14:30.454 --> 14:31.872
Paying the man.

14:31.956 --> 14:33.457
We don't want this.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.417
You sure?

14:35.501 --> 14:36.794
Yeah, I'm sure.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.673
We're looking for God.
God God.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.174
The God.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.468
Not this.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.976
Get out of here, preacher man.
You had your chance.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.811
Let's go. Y'all too.
Get out of here, you freaks.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.647
You don't know
what you're missing out on.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.656
That suit was so...

15:05.823 --> 15:06.991
Form fitting.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.451
It'd be bloody hard
to get out of, I'd imagine, huh?

15:09.535 --> 15:10.953
Unless he never
takes it off.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.788
She might very well
enjoy grooming him, you know.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.039
Oh, you think
they're a couple?

15:14.248 --> 15:15.833
How do they
make the, uh...

15:15.916 --> 15:18.168
Well, I think
that's what the bloody treats are for,

15:18.252 --> 15:19.295
if you know what I mean.

15:19.753 --> 15:23.007
They dip it in.
I think they dab it, dab...

15:27.636 --> 15:28.721
I don't feel so good.

15:28.804 --> 15:29.888
Well, neither do I.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.099
Stomach's still doing
bloody flips after seeing that.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.268
Not that.
I gotta go lie down.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.603
We're only just
getting started.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.771
Yeah, and I don't feel good.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.566
- Give me a second.
- All right.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.863
What's going on, Tulip?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.824
I told you a bunch
of times, okay?

15:49.533 --> 15:50.993
Got a stomach ache.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.205
It's like a piercing,
sharp grabby kinda feeling.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.543
"Sharp grabby kinda feeling?"

16:01.879 --> 16:03.172
Is that all you gotta say?

16:04.715 --> 16:05.883
Yeah.

16:07.343 --> 16:08.677
All right.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.096
Feel better.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.640
Don't be mad at me.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.183
Why would I be mad at you?

16:14.266 --> 16:16.101
I don't know.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.227
No reason.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.563
Maybe about
the not getting married.

16:23.359 --> 16:25.861
Marriage is stupid,
like we said.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.237
I know.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.115
God's missing, Tulip.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.241
I gotta find him.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.327
Hey.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.831
Till the end
of the world, right?

16:39.208 --> 16:40.376
Right.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.838
- Oh.
- Looks like it's just me and you, Cass.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.507
Where's she going?

16:46.590 --> 16:47.591
Oh, I dunno.

16:47.675 --> 16:48.676
Motel.

16:48.759 --> 16:49.843
Let's try that one.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.136
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, Padre.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.680
I'm gonna have
to go with her.

16:52.763 --> 16:53.722
What?

16:53.806 --> 16:55.057
Well, she can't check
into a motel.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.475
We're staying with Denis.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.518
Who?

16:57.601 --> 16:59.019
The guy who we're
staying with, Denis,

16:59.103 --> 17:00.896
if he finds out we're
staying in a motel,

17:00.979 --> 17:02.940
he'll never forgive
me, all right?

17:03.273 --> 17:04.775
I'll text you the address.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.735
You're gonna love him.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.541
Lookin' for God.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.334
- What's that?
- Lookin' for God!

17:23.877 --> 17:26.255
Yo.
Order your drink and take a hike, buddy.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.632
Ratwater, neat.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.343
Hey. You know that joke
about the preacher who walks into a bar?

17:31.468 --> 17:32.678
That's him.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.808
A preacher
lookin' for God. That's a joke.

17:42.271 --> 17:43.272
Oh...

17:50.195 --> 17:51.321
You seem anxious.

17:52.156 --> 17:53.741
I ain't anxious.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.868
All right,
a little nervous, then.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.494
But it's okay.

17:57.578 --> 17:58.829
It makes sense.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.456
Now, I'm nervous
and I'm not the one

18:00.539 --> 18:02.416
who just killed a man
with a pager wand.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.042
Why are you talking
about that?

18:04.126 --> 18:05.586
I told you not to talk
about that.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.421
- I just have a couple of questions.
- No!

18:07.504 --> 18:08.964
All right,
well, one question, then. Like...

18:09.047 --> 18:10.090
No questions!

18:10.215 --> 18:11.258
None. Got it.

18:12.885 --> 18:13.969
Shit.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.023
So, we're on the run.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.109
Statement, not a question.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.862
What?

18:33.989 --> 18:35.157
Tulip?

18:37.576 --> 18:41.288
Tulip O'Hare,
I thought that was your cute little backside.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.248
Hi, Mrs. Barbaret.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.750
Where've you been, honey?

18:44.833 --> 18:47.711
Oh, you know, just...
Out of town.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.130
Well, you stop all your
running around

18:50.214 --> 18:52.257
and come over for
some of my doberge.

18:52.341 --> 18:54.802
I'll make the lemon
like you like.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.261
Thank you, Mrs. Barbaret.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.471
That sounds real good.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.140
You been a stranger too long.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.271
She seems really nice.

19:06.355 --> 19:07.397
Shit.

19:07.481 --> 19:08.607
Maybe not.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.114
How do you know
this guy again?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.157
Who, Denis?

19:17.241 --> 19:18.784
Ah, we go way back.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.078
He's hysterical.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.413
Denis!

19:23.497 --> 19:25.541
My God, man. You look great.
Come here!

19:25.624 --> 19:27.501
It's good to see you.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.877
Tulip, Denis.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.462
Denis, Tulip.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.554
Mmm-hmm.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.148
- Do you speak French?
- No.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.568
Yeah, neither of us
got any of that, Denis,

19:52.651 --> 19:56.071
but we would like to sleep
in your house for a very long time.

20:02.786 --> 20:03.787
Well, come on quick.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.088
You sure
he's okay with this?

20:14.840 --> 20:17.009
He left the door open,
didn't he?

20:20.470 --> 20:23.390
I know where you can
find God, Preacher.

20:23.473 --> 20:24.725
Man-dog in the basement.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.310
- Hey!
- No, I saw that already.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.312
- It's not what I'm looking for.
- Don't talk to her.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.108
Eddie,
you're so embarrassing.

20:43.785 --> 20:44.828
Hey.

20:47.623 --> 20:51.752
I just wanted to say thank you
for letting us stay.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.296
I got you these.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.673
I remember
you liked the ones with the peanuts, so...

20:57.716 --> 20:58.717
Yeah.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.928
Listen, no need
to go to any trouble.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.597
We're getting ourselves
settled in back there all right, so...

21:03.680 --> 21:05.515
And I've got another friend
coming over, too.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.643
He's a preacher... Preacher.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.519
Man of God, Denis.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.940
We're on
a really big mission.

21:14.024 --> 21:16.485
It's big,
it's important stuff. Really, it is.

21:20.614 --> 21:22.574
Oh, Three Stooges.

21:22.658 --> 21:23.659
It's a classic, isn't it?

21:23.742 --> 21:25.786
In any language,
that's good.

21:27.663 --> 21:28.664
All right.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.582
I'll leave you to it.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.888
All right, so...

21:44.972 --> 21:47.015
Towels are in the closet,
bathroom down the hall.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.976
I just spoke to Denis,
he's thrilled we're here...

21:49.059 --> 21:51.061
I can't be here, Cassidy.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.189
You're afraid of someone.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.566
Statement,
it's not a question.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.402
Why did it have
to be New Orleans, huh?

21:58.944 --> 22:00.862
I knew someone
would see me here.

22:01.196 --> 22:04.241
Mrs. Barbaret's probably
telling Viktor right now.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.993
Viktor? Who's Viktor?

22:07.411 --> 22:08.537
Doesn't matter.

22:08.620 --> 22:12.582
What matters is I screwed him,
and now I'm here in his backyard.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.126
Stupid New Orleans!

22:14.209 --> 22:16.169
All right.
We could always just leave.

22:16.253 --> 22:17.587
You know,
I'm a big proponent

22:17.713 --> 22:19.006
of running away
from your problems.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.257
Yeah, well, Jesse's not.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.592
As long as he thinks
God's here, he's not going anywhere.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.387
I'm sure he might,
if he knew about your troubles.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.805
If he knew
about my troubles...

22:28.348 --> 22:30.517
...he'd make it a whole
lot worse, believe me.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.185
Why would he do that?

22:32.269 --> 22:34.187
He's your ex-fiancé
and he loves you.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.361
I can't tell him.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.697
Well, then let me help
you out.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.242
You can't help me, Cassidy.

22:47.325 --> 22:49.411
Really? You serious?

22:49.494 --> 22:52.539
Helped you move the body
of your murder victim, didn't I?

22:52.622 --> 22:55.417
And I've helped you lie
to my best mate more than once now.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.253
- I know, but...
- I helped to set up these free digs, as well.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.422
I think I can be pretty
damn helpful, actually.

23:00.505 --> 23:01.715
I'm not saying...

23:01.882 --> 23:03.884
No, you're treatin' me
like an idiot Irish sidekick

23:03.967 --> 23:06.053
and I think you need
to tell me

23:06.178 --> 23:08.263
what the hell is going
on here, love.

23:23.945 --> 23:25.572
<i>Excuse me.
Looking for God.</i>

23:25.655 --> 23:27.699
<i>What the hell are
you talking about?</i>

23:27.783 --> 23:28.950
<i>Seen God?</i>

23:29.034 --> 23:30.285
<i>Get lost weirdo.</i>

23:30.535 --> 23:32.079
<i>Have you seen God?</i>

23:32.162 --> 23:33.997
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

23:35.165 --> 23:36.291
<i>I'm looking for God.</i>

23:36.374 --> 23:38.418
<i>In a bar?
Good one preacher.</i>

23:38.502 --> 23:40.087
<i>I'll have
whatever he's smokin'.</i>

23:40.170 --> 23:41.254
<i>Seen God?</i>

23:41.338 --> 23:44.758
<i>You lookin' for
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny too?</i>

23:46.468 --> 23:49.387
<i>You tell him
where God is. You're the preacher, man.</i>

23:50.847 --> 23:52.099
<i>Excuse me.</i>

23:52.182 --> 23:53.642
<i>Looking for God.</i>

23:54.351 --> 23:56.186
<i>Seen God? Looking for God.</i>

24:00.398 --> 24:01.817
Bar's closed, buddy.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.318
Time to go.

24:09.825 --> 24:11.076
Seen God?

24:12.035 --> 24:13.662
In New Orleans?

24:14.955 --> 24:16.289
Never mind.

24:23.547 --> 24:24.714
Hey.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.343
Might wanna talk to the singer
at Le Chamonix.

24:34.266 --> 24:36.268
<i>Almost blue</i>

24:36.351 --> 24:40.939
<i>It's almost touching,
it will</i>

24:42.232 --> 24:44.985
<i>Almost do</i>

24:46.361 --> 24:49.489
<i>There is a part of me that's</i>

24:49.573 --> 24:52.784
<i>Always true</i>

24:55.328 --> 24:56.663
<i>Always</i>

24:58.623 --> 25:01.585
<i>Not all good things</i>

25:03.128 --> 25:05.755
<i>Come to an end, now</i>

25:05.839 --> 25:09.009
<i>It is only</i>

25:09.092 --> 25:11.761
<i>A chosen few</i>

25:12.804 --> 25:14.806
<i>I have seen such</i>

25:14.890 --> 25:19.853
<i>An unhappy</i>

25:20.896 --> 25:23.857
<i>Couple</i>

25:24.649 --> 25:27.944
<i>Almost me</i>

25:29.529 --> 25:32.407
<i>Almost you</i>

25:33.825 --> 25:36.203
<i>Almost</i>

25:36.286 --> 25:40.582
<i>Blue</i>

25:46.546 --> 25:47.881
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:56.139 --> 25:58.433
Make it a double
tonight, Stan.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.268
Put that on my tab.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.146
I'm Lewis.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.565
Lara. Thanks for the drink.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.275
Thank you, honey.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.321
I don't make a habit
of talking to ladies in bars,

26:11.404 --> 26:12.656
but I got to tell you,

26:12.739 --> 26:14.157
you're about the hottest thing
I've seen since fire.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.662
Well, thank you, Lewis.

26:20.330 --> 26:22.207
So, you like America, huh?

26:23.083 --> 26:24.209
Who doesn't?

26:24.292 --> 26:26.294
Which part about
it do you love most?

26:26.378 --> 26:27.963
The freedom, of course.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.547
Hmm, I love that part, too.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.717
Well, sounds like you and me
have a lot in common.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.844
How about you let me
take you to dinner?

26:35.637 --> 26:36.680
Hmm.

26:38.932 --> 26:43.728
Or we could just cut the bullshit
and go back to my dressing room.

26:46.273 --> 26:50.694
Two America-loving patriots
just free to do

26:52.195 --> 26:53.530
whatever we want.

26:54.364 --> 26:55.740
Yes, ma'am.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.952
You just have
to answer me one question first.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.495
I am not married.

27:00.578 --> 27:03.123
That's not my question, Lewis.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.711
What's the capital
of Florida?

27:12.799 --> 27:16.553
Um, I think it's Tallahassee.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.637
Oh!

27:18.221 --> 27:19.472
So close.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.309
Sorry, Lewis.

27:44.247 --> 27:47.542
I believe Tallahassee
is the capital of Florida.

27:47.625 --> 27:48.626
Hmm.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.879
But he wasn't sure.

27:53.798 --> 27:56.301
Lemme guess,
you're a man who knows his capitals.

27:58.261 --> 27:59.387
Nope.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.265
Never really been interested
in geography.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.102
That's right,

28:06.186 --> 28:08.521
preachers aren't allowed
to be interested in geography.

28:09.898 --> 28:11.483
That's Catholics.

28:12.025 --> 28:14.152
I can be interested
in whatever I want.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.113
So what are you
interested in?

28:18.448 --> 28:19.616
God.

28:22.452 --> 28:25.038
I didn't have you pegged
as a cliche.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.750
Bartender at Sugar Foot said
you might know where He is.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.377
Which bartender's that?

28:30.460 --> 28:33.296
Tall black guy.
Said I should talk to you.

28:39.803 --> 28:41.888
Clean yourself up,
meet me outside.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.556
Freak!

28:43.640 --> 28:44.933
How dare you!

29:11.793 --> 29:13.086
No!

29:21.803 --> 29:22.804
Stop.

29:45.368 --> 29:46.369
Aah!

29:58.465 --> 29:59.466
Aah!

30:12.896 --> 30:13.897
You all right?

30:15.773 --> 30:17.192
Who are you?

30:19.068 --> 30:20.528
Jesse Custer.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.990
I'm not with them.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.875
Come with me.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.183
Did she go down okay?

30:50.266 --> 30:52.185
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.489
Where are you gonna go?

31:04.572 --> 31:05.698
Someplace I can
keep Gracie safe.

31:07.283 --> 31:08.535
One sec?

31:13.289 --> 31:15.041
Hey, sweetie.
How you doin'?

31:15.124 --> 31:16.125
Mama's home.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.419
Go back to sleep.

31:39.232 --> 31:41.025
Those men back there.

31:42.777 --> 31:44.904
How'd you get them to stop?

31:44.988 --> 31:46.573
I told 'em to.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.408
You told them to?

31:48.491 --> 31:49.909
It's the collar.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.828
Gives me an authority.

31:53.663 --> 31:55.707
Who are they?
What do they want?

31:55.790 --> 31:58.418
They are a super-secret
crypto-religious

31:58.501 --> 31:59.752
fascist organization

31:59.836 --> 32:02.171
with designs on total
world domination.

32:02.589 --> 32:04.716
Yeah, that's the
same look I had when I heard it.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.050
Who told you that?

32:06.134 --> 32:09.262
Some guy who used to come
into the club,

32:09.345 --> 32:11.472
drink, hit on me, whatever.

32:12.056 --> 32:14.100
No, he said
they were after him.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.602
Why? What'd they
want from him?

32:15.685 --> 32:19.856
He comes in one night,
tells me God's missing.

32:20.732 --> 32:23.693
And that these people
in white suits are after him.

32:23.776 --> 32:24.819
Warning him to be quiet.

32:24.902 --> 32:25.903
Who is this guy?

32:26.863 --> 32:28.239
Where can I find him?

32:29.824 --> 32:30.867
He's dead.

32:31.242 --> 32:33.369
Body washed up
in the swamps.

32:33.453 --> 32:34.621
Until tonight,

32:34.704 --> 32:37.624
I tried to tell myself
it was a coincidence, but...

32:38.833 --> 32:42.420
I mean, they find dead
guys in the swamps all the time, right?

32:43.087 --> 32:46.633
I just couldn't
shake the feeling

32:46.716 --> 32:48.801
I was being followed
by men in white.

32:48.885 --> 32:50.678
Well, they must've known
you talked to him.

32:50.762 --> 32:53.306
- I thought I was losing my mind.
- Hey.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.016
If you hadn't come along...

32:55.141 --> 32:56.726
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

32:58.561 --> 33:00.772
It's just lucky I was there.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.400
Real lucky.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.571
Seriously,

33:09.072 --> 33:11.199
how'd you get them to stop?

33:12.367 --> 33:13.534
Like I said, I told them to.

33:13.660 --> 33:14.827
No.

33:14.911 --> 33:16.162
These aren't the kind
of people

33:16.245 --> 33:17.830
who stop because someone
tells 'em to.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.584
How did you make
them stop, Preacher?

33:23.211 --> 33:25.004
I have a power.

33:25.755 --> 33:28.257
I can make people
do anything I say.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.428
So, hold on, you...

33:32.970 --> 33:34.722
You can just say something
and they do it?

33:34.806 --> 33:36.516
Mmm-hmm.

33:40.478 --> 33:41.646
Show me.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.273
I don't think that would
be a good idea.

33:44.357 --> 33:46.067
Like, for example,

33:48.695 --> 33:50.613
say I wanted to kiss you.

33:54.784 --> 33:56.911
Could you make me stop?

33:59.455 --> 34:02.417
Even if I really,

34:04.252 --> 34:06.212
really wanted to?

34:11.008 --> 34:12.135
Stop.

34:40.329 --> 34:42.165
Hey, sweet baby.
Mama'll be right back.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.960
I'm going to the airport.

34:47.336 --> 34:49.088
You sure this is all right?

34:49.172 --> 34:51.340
We'll be okay
with my sister.

34:51.674 --> 34:54.719
Strange, I never thought much
about God before all this.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.679
Not many people have.

34:57.305 --> 34:59.932
Why would He leave heaven?
What's He thinking?

35:00.016 --> 35:01.517
I don't know.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.562
Well, I hope you find him.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.273
I will.

35:07.857 --> 35:11.027
You know what, Preacher?
I believe you just might.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.113
Got you that time.

35:14.822 --> 35:15.865
Bye.

35:17.033 --> 35:18.534
You take care.

36:10.127 --> 36:11.128
Hey.

36:11.254 --> 36:12.296
Hey.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.383
Whatcha doin'?

36:15.466 --> 36:17.009
Workin'.

36:17.093 --> 36:18.094
<i>Still looking?</i>

36:18.177 --> 36:19.345
Yeah, I'm still looking.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.430
<i>It seems like we might
not be the only ones</i>

36:21.597 --> 36:23.599
<i>- that know God's missing.</i>
- Hmm.

36:24.851 --> 36:27.103
<i>Some kind of cover up.
Some sort of group.</i>

36:27.186 --> 36:29.480
<i>I'm just trying
to figure out why.</i>

36:30.273 --> 36:31.774
Well, that's cool.

36:34.652 --> 36:35.695
What's up?

36:35.778 --> 36:38.322
<i>Well, we're at this guy
Denis's place.</i>

36:38.406 --> 36:40.867
Cassidy keeps talking about
how great he is,

36:40.950 --> 36:44.745
but I think he pretty much
hates Cassidy's guts, so...

36:47.707 --> 36:50.960
But he's got cereal
and Pop-Tarts.

36:51.544 --> 36:52.837
Is that why you called me?

36:52.920 --> 36:54.130
I'm just fillin' you in.

36:56.132 --> 36:57.884
Come on, Tulip.
What's going on?

37:04.056 --> 37:05.933
Did you call me
just to breathe down the phone?

37:06.017 --> 37:07.018
<i>No.</i>

37:07.101 --> 37:09.061
I just wanted to say...

37:14.025 --> 37:15.067
Stuff.

37:15.151 --> 37:16.736
Well, you ain't saying
any stuff!

37:16.819 --> 37:18.487
Well, you ain't saying
any stuff neither!

37:18.571 --> 37:19.572
I gotta go.

37:20.823 --> 37:22.074
Fine.

37:22.617 --> 37:24.994
Go find your God then,
Preacher.

37:36.589 --> 37:37.590
Tulip?

37:38.341 --> 37:39.300
Tulip.

37:39.383 --> 37:40.635
Where you goin'?

37:40.718 --> 37:42.303
Just to get smokes.

37:42.386 --> 37:44.513
Would you want some company?

37:44.597 --> 37:46.140
I'll be okay.

38:50.538 --> 38:51.706
Hello?

38:55.084 --> 38:56.252
Hello?

38:59.380 --> 39:00.923
Who's there?

39:47.219 --> 39:49.555
Oh, heavy set, boys.

39:50.765 --> 39:51.766
Oh, one more.

39:51.849 --> 39:53.517
Come on, one more!

39:55.853 --> 39:57.354
What do you want to hear, man?

39:57.438 --> 39:59.315
Oh, that's a tough
choice, brother.

39:59.482 --> 40:01.192
<i>A Walk To The Peak?</i>

40:01.275 --> 40:03.110
- Oh.
- Yeah.

40:03.194 --> 40:04.862
Deep cut, daddy-o.

40:05.488 --> 40:06.572
Yeah.

40:06.655 --> 40:09.492
One, two, one, two, uh...

40:23.964 --> 40:26.675
Would someone please
get me a damn dog next time?

40:30.971 --> 40:32.389
Was the intel right?

40:32.473 --> 40:35.434
Whatever Custer's got,
it's for real.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.186
So what do you want
to do about it?

40:37.269 --> 40:39.605
Kick him up to Samson Unit.

40:39.688 --> 40:40.981
You sure?

40:42.358 --> 40:43.400
Do it.

41:25.985 --> 41:28.237
Track is 18 carat, brother.

41:32.032 --> 41:36.912
Been listening to it a lot,
trying to understand what it's about.

41:39.290 --> 41:40.958
Can't you feel it?

41:52.887 --> 41:54.763
Yeah. That's right.

41:55.264 --> 41:58.517
Yeah. Now you're
diggin' it, daddy-o.

41:58.893 --> 42:00.936
It's the end of the world.

42:45.981 --> 42:47.024
Hey.

42:47.775 --> 42:49.652
Got change for a 100?

42:50.736 --> 42:52.571
All I got's a 5.

42:52.655 --> 42:53.739
Fine.

43:42.705 --> 43:44.581
Everyone out. Now!

44:21.910 --> 44:24.246
Viktor, we got her.
