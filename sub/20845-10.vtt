"The Carmichael Show" <i>is recorded
in front of a live studio audience.</i>

00:03.609 --> 00:06.171
I'm just saying,
something has to be wrong

00:06.218 --> 00:07.500
with Maxine's sister,

00:07.536 --> 00:11.890
the way Maxine has kept her
away from us all this time.

00:11.959 --> 00:14.726
You think she has any deformities?

00:15.639 --> 00:17.523
What if she only has one hand?

00:17.559 --> 00:20.375
Are we supposed to shake her nub?

00:20.569 --> 00:22.051
Okay, relax, Ma.

00:22.140 --> 00:24.132
I've met Casey before.
She doesn't have a nub.

00:24.168 --> 00:25.492
If she had a nub, don't you think

00:25.528 --> 00:26.694
I would have led with that?

00:26.804 --> 00:27.890
Well...

00:27.926 --> 00:29.546
something got to be wrong with her.

00:29.740 --> 00:32.741
I hope she don't have
none of that Asperger's.

00:33.359 --> 00:35.453
Lord knows,

00:35.626 --> 00:38.070
I don't do well with
people with Asperger's.

00:38.251 --> 00:40.006
See, I-I get scared

00:40.042 --> 00:41.961
that I'm gonna say one
of their trigger words,

00:41.997 --> 00:45.156
so I get real quiet; I
shut down emotionally.

00:45.273 --> 00:48.796
I basically become
a person with Asperger's

00:48.914 --> 00:51.164
around people with Asperger's.

00:51.629 --> 00:53.367
God, I hope they can find a cure.

00:53.521 --> 00:57.414
Okay, there's nothing
wrong with Maxine's sister.

00:57.494 --> 00:59.507
You just haven't seen her
because she's been busy

00:59.550 --> 01:01.453
at school, but she's a nice girl.

01:01.492 --> 01:03.001
Like, I think you guys will like her.

01:03.036 --> 01:05.289
She's like a... quieter Maxine.

01:05.453 --> 01:08.914
Well, I like the idea
of a quieter Maxine.

01:09.502 --> 01:11.687
Well, look, I-if there's
nothing wrong with her,

01:11.723 --> 01:13.004
you'll set me up
with her, right?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.240
No.

01:15.054 --> 01:16.976
You're selfish, Jerrod,
you know that?

01:18.304 --> 01:20.616
He was always a terrible sharer.

01:20.890 --> 01:24.178
Wouldn't let your brother,
Bobby, touch your Hot Wheels!

01:24.881 --> 01:27.413
Didn't want him touching
your Sega Dreamcast.

01:27.495 --> 01:30.092
Well, Jerrod, it stops here.

01:30.148 --> 01:32.210
You gonna let your brother have sex

01:32.272 --> 01:34.639
with your girlfriend's sister.
That's final!

01:38.809 --> 01:39.886
Hey, everyone.

01:39.922 --> 01:41.879
So, this is my little sister, Casey.

01:41.967 --> 01:43.383
I'm so excited for you 
to meet her.

01:43.419 --> 01:44.457
Here she is.

01:44.495 --> 01:45.762
Hey, Casey. Meet my family.

01:45.798 --> 01:47.160
Nice to meet everyone. Hi.

01:47.203 --> 01:48.670
Wow, what a relief.

01:48.828 --> 01:51.897
A nice firm handshake.

01:52.139 --> 01:54.592
And she is making eye contact.
That's a good sign.

01:54.683 --> 01:56.484
- Come on.
- Don't worry.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.819
Maxine already warned me that
you guys can be pretty direct.

01:58.854 --> 01:59.643
Mm-hmm.

01:59.679 --> 02:02.127
Better than our parents who
would get drunk and ignore us.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.792
Anyway, 
can I use your bathroom?

02:03.860 --> 02:05.115
- Uh...
- Well, first of all,

02:05.151 --> 02:06.481
I got to know
what you gonna do in there.

02:06.516 --> 02:08.068
We got a problem with the toilet.

02:08.115 --> 02:10.044
Never mind, go ahead.
Go on, do your business.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.904
Come on, Casey.

02:12.670 --> 02:13.949
Hi.

02:15.206 --> 02:16.839
Oh, my God.

02:16.966 --> 02:18.100
What?

02:18.232 --> 02:20.433
Look, either my eyes are deceiving me

02:20.744 --> 02:22.811
or Maxine's sister is Caramel Diva

02:22.879 --> 02:24.847
from the Blue Diamond Strip Club.

02:25.901 --> 02:27.433
Excuse me, what?

02:27.469 --> 02:30.738
Maxine, you brought
a sex worker into our home?

02:31.487 --> 02:34.221
I didn't.
My sister is not a stripper.

02:34.324 --> 02:36.408
Yes, she is.
I'd know that face anywhere.

02:36.486 --> 02:39.921
That is Caramel Diva using
our bathroom right now.

02:41.112 --> 02:43.041
But, look, my bad. If
you trying to keep this

02:43.077 --> 02:45.260
a family secret, I
won't say another word.

02:45.402 --> 02:47.588
No, this is not some family secret.

02:47.624 --> 02:49.598
And being a stripper is
nothing to be ashamed of.

02:49.634 --> 02:52.371
I'm just saying that you have my sister 
confused with someone else.

02:52.407 --> 02:54.371
Yeah, and, Bobby, if
you're at strip clubs

02:54.407 --> 02:56.697
looking at the women's
faces, you're doing it wrong.

02:59.399 --> 03:02.360
Well, look, when I was
going through my divorce,

03:02.511 --> 03:04.345
one of my friends took
me to the strip club

03:04.381 --> 03:05.848
to get over my depression.

03:06.135 --> 03:08.712
And that woman in that
bathroom, Caramel Diva,

03:09.188 --> 03:12.165
grinded on me for $45.

03:13.598 --> 03:16.133
Okay? And it made me feel special.

03:16.685 --> 03:18.321
That lap dance,

03:18.929 --> 03:22.431
it felt like my own private
Tony Robbins seminar.

03:22.931 --> 03:24.767
It changed everything for me.

03:25.775 --> 03:27.830
Well, I'm happy for you,
Bobby, but it wasn't her.

03:27.923 --> 03:29.619
Well, there's only
one way to settle this.

03:29.635 --> 03:31.872
Somebody go knock on
that bathroom door

03:31.908 --> 03:34.736
and ask her, does she take
her clothes off for money?

03:34.837 --> 03:35.848
On it, Momma.

03:35.884 --> 03:37.336
No! No.

03:37.427 --> 03:39.908
No one is asking my sister
if she is a stripper.

03:39.944 --> 03:41.870
Yeah, you can't just ask
somebody if they're a stripper.

03:41.905 --> 03:42.913
That's rude.

03:43.036 --> 03:44.997
That's right up there
with asking a burn victim,

03:45.033 --> 03:47.306
"What the hell happened
to your face?"

03:49.275 --> 03:50.603
Now, the polite thing to do

03:50.681 --> 03:54.048
is to look away and pretend
that they don't exist.

04:02.611 --> 04:04.103
What?

04:05.126 --> 04:07.814
Come on, girl, stop playing games.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.345
I know who you are...

04:10.419 --> 04:11.837
and you know who you are.

04:11.926 --> 04:12.993
Bobby.

04:13.140 --> 04:14.478
I'm sorry.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.183
For some reason, he
thinks you're a stripper.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.878
Maxine, we need to talk.

04:22.589 --> 04:23.800

It's beneath you.
You're smart.

04:47.096 --> 04:48.315
You should be in school.

04:48.384 --> 04:49.747
Maxine, it's not degrading.

And you don't have the right to

Well, we already know
that you grinded on my son,

04:57.358 --> 04:59.126
so I think
we're a little past privacy.

05:00.821 --> 05:01.849
Maxine,

05:01.892 --> 05:03.408
don't be so hard on your sister.

05:03.444 --> 05:05.092
I mean, weren't you just
saying a few minutes ago

05:05.127 --> 05:07.110
that stripping is
nothing to be ashamed of?

05:07.170 --> 05:08.603
Yeah, it's nothing to be ashamed of

05:08.648 --> 05:10.482
unless you are my little sister.

05:10.649 --> 05:13.103
We used to hold hands and
go ice skating together.

05:13.232 --> 05:17.524
Ice skating? Whoo,
rich people are something else.

05:18.355 --> 05:21.057
Maxine, you can't be someone
who says that they're open-minded

05:21.093 --> 05:22.197
when it comes to stripping...

05:22.232 --> 05:24.470
and that it's just women
owning their sexuality,

05:24.516 --> 05:26.473
and then change your mind
the second you find out

05:26.509 --> 05:27.634
it's someone close to you.

05:27.724 --> 05:30.149
I mean, every stripper
is someone's baby sister,

05:30.190 --> 05:34.115
or daughter, or young hot aunt.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.649
Now, listen, young lady,
I don't want to come off aggressive.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.077
I know we just met.

05:39.145 --> 05:41.943
But if I was your
mother, I'd kill myself.

05:45.185 --> 05:47.662
All right, let's go easy on her.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.740
Let's not forget that she provides

05:49.822 --> 05:51.787
a very necessary service.

05:51.849 --> 05:52.857
Oh, Joe.

05:52.912 --> 05:54.435
Well, somebody's got to strip.

05:54.548 --> 05:57.139
I always said
cities can not function

05:57.178 --> 05:58.997
without hospitals or strip clubs.

05:59.131 --> 06:02.232
That's the reason they
both open on Christmas.

06:03.115 --> 06:04.889
So, Joe, if you had a daughter,

06:04.967 --> 06:06.738
you would be fine
with her stripping?

06:06.928 --> 06:08.406
Well, God blessed me with sons

06:08.442 --> 06:10.110
because He knew
I wasn't strong enough

06:10.163 --> 06:11.701
to face that question.

06:12.849 --> 06:15.467
Casey, what happened?
Why are you doing this?

06:15.584 --> 06:16.744
Are you trying to piss off Dad?

06:16.779 --> 06:18.583
No, I choose to do this.

06:18.724 --> 06:20.482
I like dancing.
It's good money.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.967
I feel sexy and I'm really good at it.

06:23.003 --> 06:24.990
Yep, I can attest to that.

06:26.131 --> 06:27.232
Look, Caramel Diva,

06:27.293 --> 06:29.828
you are one of the most
talented dancers I've ever seen.

06:29.895 --> 06:31.496
In fact, I think
you're a better dancer

06:31.564 --> 06:33.943
than Maxine is a therapist.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.553
You made me feel better

06:35.662 --> 06:37.302
about myself in 15 minutes

06:37.389 --> 06:41.529
than Maxine has done after
years of conversations.

06:41.774 --> 06:44.776
You're not only a great
dancer, you a healer.

06:46.345 --> 06:48.346
You are too beautiful to be a stripper.

06:48.632 --> 06:51.443
Now, seeing a beautiful stripper is like

06:51.599 --> 06:55.318
seeing an Asian man
working at McDonald's.

06:55.842 --> 06:57.553
I just want
to grab him and say,

06:57.589 --> 06:59.545
"You don't need to do this.

06:59.974 --> 07:03.998
People that look like you
are supposed to do better."

07:04.795 --> 07:07.279
Cynthia, that was extremely racist,

07:07.553 --> 07:09.037
but I agree with the sentiment.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.936
Casey, this woman and I have
never agreed on anything.

07:12.004 --> 07:14.943
And we dislike what you're doing
so much that it's uniting us.

07:15.022 --> 07:17.568
It's true. We don't get along.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.642
In fact, I was actually in
Trader Joe's the other day,

07:20.678 --> 07:24.654
saw Maxine, didn't speak to
her like she was a stranger.

07:25.716 --> 07:27.826
That was you.

07:29.928 --> 07:30.990
Now, Maxine,

07:31.026 --> 07:32.873
before you go trying to decide

07:32.952 --> 07:35.240
that what your sister's
doing is right or wrong,

07:35.342 --> 07:38.796
we need to ask her the most
important question of all:

07:38.976 --> 07:41.911
Casey, how much money do
you make, uh, stripping?

07:42.124 --> 07:44.475
That's a good question, Daddy.

07:45.068 --> 07:47.061
Um, I... I really, I don't want to.

07:47.097 --> 07:48.745
Joe, don't be rude.

07:48.781 --> 07:49.989
Now, she don't need to tell us

07:50.024 --> 07:51.558
how much money
she makes a year,

07:51.658 --> 07:53.792
but is it over $60,000?

07:53.946 --> 07:55.570
Cynthia.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.013
I am collecting data.

07:57.049 --> 07:59.382
We're trying to help you, Maxine.

08:00.459 --> 08:02.218
So is it over $60?

08:02.382 --> 08:04.116
I mean, we ain't talking $70, are we?

08:04.163 --> 08:05.225
Um...

08:05.277 --> 08:07.476
Oh, my God.
She makes over $70,000?

08:07.607 --> 08:09.508
Okay. Casey, I'm sorry.

08:09.601 --> 08:13.501
My family will stop
asking if you just tell us.

08:17.383 --> 08:19.868
Okay. If you really need to know,

08:20.329 --> 08:21.973
last year I made $92,000.

08:22.048 --> 08:24.351
- Sweet Shepard of Jesus.
- Get out of town!

08:24.454 --> 08:25.774
Oh, wow. Oh-ho.

08:25.817 --> 08:28.399
I mean, who are we to criticize Casey?

08:28.554 --> 08:30.394
I mean,
if she went back to high school

08:30.430 --> 08:32.929
and told her guidance counselor
she made $92,000 a year,

08:32.969 --> 08:34.160
her guidance counselor would quit

08:34.196 --> 08:35.905
and start stripping herself.

08:37.258 --> 08:39.224
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Nekeisha.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.898
- Hi. - Hey.
- Wait a minute.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.160
Caramel Diva, is that you?

08:44.260 --> 08:46.292
How many people in this house

08:46.378 --> 08:48.299
are regulars at this strip club?

08:48.413 --> 08:50.644
Uh, well, I'm not a regular.
I just brought Bobby there

08:50.706 --> 08:52.788
when he was having trouble
getting over the divorce.

08:52.844 --> 08:54.527
Caramel Diva,
what are you doing here?

08:54.581 --> 08:55.723
I'm Maxine's sister.

08:55.759 --> 08:56.765
My real name is Casey.

08:56.801 --> 08:58.908
Oh, well, that's gonna
be hard to remember

08:58.944 --> 09:00.675
since I met you as Caramel Diva

09:00.761 --> 09:02.370
and that really stuck with me.

09:02.503 --> 09:05.402
I'm just gonna keep calling
you Caramel Diva, okay?

09:06.300 --> 09:07.350
Uh, wait a minute.

09:07.386 --> 09:10.534
Bobby,
you mean to tell me

09:10.800 --> 09:13.753
the friend who took you to a strip club

09:14.097 --> 09:16.214
to help you get over
your divorce from Nekeisha

09:16.269 --> 09:18.159
was Nekeisha?

09:20.065 --> 09:21.941
Well, somebody had to, okay?

09:22.112 --> 09:23.735
I was devastated.

09:23.894 --> 09:26.323
I was crying for,
like, six days straight.

09:26.639 --> 09:30.323
I was afraid I was gonna cry
out all the sodium out my body.

09:31.058 --> 09:33.778
Maxine, why didn't you tell
us your sister was a dancer?

09:34.003 --> 09:35.308
Because I didn't know.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.737
Clearly, she was
too ashamed to tell me.

09:37.789 --> 09:40.605
I'm not ashamed. I just didn't
want to deal with all this.

09:40.691 --> 09:42.339
Look how judgmental you're being.

09:42.441 --> 09:44.909
See, this is the exact
behavior that keeps women

09:44.956 --> 09:46.491
from moving forward in society.

09:46.559 --> 09:48.073
We don't need men
to tear us down,

09:48.109 --> 09:50.105
'cause we doing it to ourselves!

09:50.429 --> 09:51.909
I am not tearing her down,

09:51.945 --> 09:53.839
but I'm concerned with
the negative impact

09:53.899 --> 09:56.668
that degrading herself will
have on her for years to come.

09:56.735 --> 09:58.511
Enough with the therapy.

09:58.614 --> 09:59.808
For once, I would love it

09:59.844 --> 10:01.248
if you could try to understand me

10:01.284 --> 10:03.292
instead of trying to
judge me all the time.

10:03.328 --> 10:05.683
Yes, I hate when she does that.

10:06.798 --> 10:09.666
You should have seen the
judgmental look she gave me

10:09.758 --> 10:13.316
when I said dog-fighting
wasn't no big deal.

10:16.018 --> 10:18.547
Casey, all I have ever
tried to do is protect you.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.472
You know that we couldn't
rely on Mom and Dad.

10:20.508 --> 10:22.006
They're alcoholic narcissists.

10:22.138 --> 10:24.558
There you go judging again.

10:24.753 --> 10:27.058
They are party people.

10:27.230 --> 10:29.067
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

10:29.347 --> 10:30.683
Maxine...

10:31.237 --> 10:33.304
this is the problem
with our relationship.

10:33.394 --> 10:35.448
We're not as close as
you think we are.

10:35.581 --> 10:37.909
Uh, I don't even think
of you as a sister.

10:38.034 --> 10:40.511
You feel more like a second mom to me.

10:40.591 --> 10:42.184
That's why
I don't share things with you

10:42.219 --> 10:44.136
and why I don't come
around too often.

10:44.378 --> 10:45.683
Look, Casey, I want us

10:45.719 --> 10:47.253
to have a healthy relationship.

10:47.353 --> 10:50.448
But how can I not judge you?
I mean, you are stripping.

10:50.644 --> 10:52.956
Maxine, I've heard you
defend stripping before,

10:53.027 --> 10:54.926
saying it's just
women taking control

10:54.994 --> 10:57.428
over the exploitation
of their own bodies.

10:57.581 --> 11:00.100
And as a feminist myself,
I am offended

11:00.136 --> 11:01.589
by how hypocritical you're being.

11:01.698 --> 11:02.800
Jerrod, you have never

11:02.868 --> 11:04.605
said nor done anything

11:04.698 --> 11:08.394
in support of a feminist
cause in your entire life.

11:08.612 --> 11:10.796
But that's what you can do,
you can just label yourself

11:10.831 --> 11:12.745
a feminist and be one?

11:13.078 --> 11:17.682
Well, if Rachel Dolezal gets
to be black by just saying it,

11:18.354 --> 11:21.807
I guess Jerrod gets to be
a feminist.

11:22.101 --> 11:23.666
Maxine, it's easy

11:23.702 --> 11:25.923
to judge when you don't
have firsthand experience.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.292
Maybe you should walk a mile

11:27.393 --> 11:30.487
in your sister's clear
plastic hooker heels.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.146
You mean strip?

11:32.213 --> 11:33.392
Mm-hmm.

11:34.119 --> 11:35.642
Oh, please. My sister

11:35.712 --> 11:37.235
would never do that.

11:37.336 --> 11:39.736
Judging something without
any facts or experience

11:39.829 --> 11:41.639
is one of her favorite things to do.

11:41.707 --> 11:43.275
Oh, she does do that a lot.

11:43.322 --> 11:47.384
But, uh, as a feminist, I really
shouldn't criticize a woman.

11:47.650 --> 11:50.189
Wow, it really is that easy.

11:50.454 --> 11:52.950
See, Jerrod,
now I'm a feminist!

11:54.368 --> 11:56.283
So, if I went and stripped,

11:56.319 --> 11:57.659
that would mean
you would actually listen

11:57.694 --> 11:59.462
to my opinions and my concerns?

11:59.637 --> 12:02.837
Maxine, your sister is
not asking you to strip.

12:02.895 --> 12:04.306
Yes, I am.

12:04.478 --> 12:07.317
Look, at least I'd know
that you cared

12:07.353 --> 12:09.302
and that you were coming
from a place of experience

12:09.338 --> 12:10.470
instead of just judgment.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.689
Or you could be like normal sisters

12:12.725 --> 12:15.694
and talk things out over
a pedicure or something.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.311
You don't think
I'm gonna do this.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.134
I know you won't do this.

12:20.812 --> 12:22.046
I'm gonna do it.

12:22.114 --> 12:24.597
What are you... what are
you doing? Just go to brunch.

12:24.633 --> 12:26.175
Get-get some champagne,
some mimosas.

12:26.211 --> 12:29.406
Use my credit card.
It's on me, y'all, come on.

12:29.838 --> 12:32.609
Oh, no, brother,
they not going to brunch.

12:33.039 --> 12:35.562
Mm-mm. She about to get butt naked.

12:36.617 --> 12:40.133
Caramel Diva is now
The Sisters Caramel.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.241
All right, what do you think
of this for my stripping outfit?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.506
You look like Morticia
from The Addams Family.

12:50.555 --> 12:52.928
You're not doing this, Maxine.
This is insane.

12:52.964 --> 12:54.280
Yes, I am, Jerrod.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.913
This is gonna mean
a lot to my sister.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.639
And you said yourself,
she needs to know

12:57.675 --> 12:59.163
that I'm not just judging her.

12:59.514 --> 13:00.991
Okay, what do you think

13:01.038 --> 13:03.124
of this song for my dance?

13:05.000 --> 13:11.074

♪ When I was young, I knew ♪

13:14.709 --> 13:15.889
Okay, Maxine,

13:15.949 --> 13:17.046
what the hell was that?

13:17.082 --> 13:18.136
What?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.786
Just the fact that
you know that song

13:19.787 --> 13:22.256
reminds me that we had
very different childhoods.

13:23.091 --> 13:24.825
Well, if I'm gonna be stripping,

13:24.893 --> 13:26.295
it needs to be
to something emotional.

13:26.331 --> 13:27.951
Strip clubs are depressing enough

13:27.987 --> 13:29.014
when they're playing Drake!

13:29.050 --> 13:31.163
People are gonna kill
themselves to that!

13:31.616 --> 13:33.194
Here's the thing, Maxine.

13:33.337 --> 13:35.249
Every man wants a woman

13:35.375 --> 13:37.499
that other men fantasize
about seeing naked.

13:37.535 --> 13:40.842
But you don't want those guys to
actually get a chance to see it.

13:40.878 --> 13:43.053
Especially for a $15 admission.

13:43.164 --> 13:45.788
That's right, it only costs
$15 to get into that place.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.424
You are exposing yourself
for the price

13:47.460 --> 13:49.381
of a 12-piece at Popeyes.

13:50.975 --> 13:53.061
Weren't you the one
defending my sister,

13:53.097 --> 13:55.225
saying that stripping
was an okay thing to do?

13:55.298 --> 13:57.686
I was lying!
Stripping is degrading,

13:57.722 --> 14:00.007
and everybody knows that.
It's weird that it's even legal.

14:00.043 --> 14:01.898
Look, look, Maxine,
I realize that I'm as big

14:01.934 --> 14:02.723
of a hypocrite as you.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.405
I-I had no problem with stripping
until someone that I love

14:05.484 --> 14:07.724
decided to do it, and now
I have a huge problem with it.

14:07.774 --> 14:09.600
So please stop before somebody gets hurt.

14:09.756 --> 14:11.514
Look, I'm sorry,
but this isn't about you.

14:11.574 --> 14:13.342
This is about me being
there for my sister

14:13.381 --> 14:16.389
and...
trying to keep my family together.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.288
Are you telling me

14:18.631 --> 14:22.780
that you are stripping
to save your family?

14:24.975 --> 14:25.992
Yeah.

14:26.091 --> 14:28.038
I guess that is what I'm trying to do.

14:28.123 --> 14:29.151
Now,

14:29.187 --> 14:31.107
I'm trying to work on my stripper name.

14:31.217 --> 14:33.165
So, what do you like better?

14:33.499 --> 14:35.639
Double Dip or...

14:35.969 --> 14:37.171
Wet Sprinkle?

14:37.207 --> 14:40.014
Ugh, Maxine,
this is just disgusting.

14:40.388 --> 14:42.803
Well, I think I'm gonna go
with Wet Sprinkle, all right?

14:42.863 --> 14:44.731
Love you.
I won't be too late.

14:44.782 --> 14:47.017
Maxine, don't just kiss me
and say you love me

14:47.053 --> 14:49.256
like everything's fine. Maxine,

14:49.316 --> 14:51.030
I'm trying to protect you, okay?

14:51.066 --> 14:52.534
It's a brutal industry!

14:52.719 --> 14:55.217
You don't have the
heart to be a stripper!

14:55.548 --> 14:58.243
You got no pain to draw from,
Maxine!

14:58.335 --> 14:59.769
Maxine!

15:01.962 --> 15:05.736
Hey, um, can I talk to
you guys for a minute?

15:06.125 --> 15:10.638
Maxine, why you look like a
prostitute Inspector Gadget?

15:13.876 --> 15:16.243
You really are going to that
amateur night, aren't you?

15:16.476 --> 15:17.626
Yeah.

15:17.778 --> 15:19.431
Man, this stripping is turning into

15:19.470 --> 15:21.876
the family business
in front of our very eyes.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.149
I don't even know
if this is even gonna help,

15:24.184 --> 15:26.134
but I don't know what else to do.

15:26.298 --> 15:27.814
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

15:27.850 --> 15:30.540
but I wish
my family was more like yours.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.997
Of course you do.

15:32.135 --> 15:35.423
Everybody likes to borrow
things from black culture,

15:35.495 --> 15:38.197
'cause we so fun and cool.

15:41.391 --> 15:42.923
No, not the culture.

15:43.045 --> 15:45.618
Also, I'm black.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.939
For the sake of argument,
sure. Go on.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.356
I just want the closeness
you all have, you know?

15:53.392 --> 15:56.251
You guys are able to
criticize each other and disagree

15:56.333 --> 15:58.681
without it ruining
your relationships.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.743
The last time my sister
and I got in an argument,

16:00.779 --> 16:02.380
we didn't speak for seven months.

16:02.486 --> 16:04.086
Seven months?

16:04.225 --> 16:06.290
Jerrod stole Bobby's first girlfriend

16:06.326 --> 16:08.907
and Bobby forgave him
by dinnertime.

16:08.957 --> 16:13.347
You see, Maxine, we had the
benefit of living without money.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.925
Nothing unites a family
more than financial struggle.

16:17.038 --> 16:19.737
You really don't know how much
you need another family member

16:19.806 --> 16:22.924
until your cable bill
is in your son's name.

16:24.276 --> 16:27.471
He's right. Our family
grew up in a small house.

16:27.552 --> 16:28.982
We couldn't avoid each other.

16:29.018 --> 16:30.983
Now,
you grew up in a big house.

16:31.174 --> 16:34.887
When your family would fight,
they could just storm off

16:34.955 --> 16:36.604
and go to separate rooms.

16:36.711 --> 16:39.446
That's why Brad and
Angelina didn't make it.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.494
Their house had too many rooms.

16:41.595 --> 16:44.363
And even with all those
international kids,

16:44.448 --> 16:47.080
they couldn't fill up that place.

16:49.823 --> 16:51.682
So what am I supposed to do?

16:51.838 --> 16:53.963
Okay, Maxine,
you got to pretend

16:54.049 --> 16:56.893
that you come from
a poor family.

16:57.119 --> 16:58.908
Say what you got to say
to your sister,

16:58.944 --> 17:01.158
but criticize her to her face.

17:01.196 --> 17:03.877
Yes, you got to call her names.

17:03.932 --> 17:07.401
You know, like, "harlot, slut!"
You know, things like that.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.877
And after it's all over, you sit down

17:10.913 --> 17:13.557
and you have dinner together,
'cause that's what families do.

17:13.627 --> 17:17.195
You disagree, you fight,
but then you stick together.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.298
Part of it is love, but, also,

17:19.366 --> 17:21.166
part of it is circumstance,
like I said.

17:21.233 --> 17:24.436
You know why Bobby and
Jerrod are so close?

17:24.635 --> 17:27.329
Because they shared a car,

17:27.532 --> 17:30.276
a bathroom, one pair of dress shoes.

17:30.343 --> 17:31.948
You know, them boys never could

17:31.984 --> 17:34.401
go to a funeral at the same time.

17:35.885 --> 17:38.010
And know this, Maxine,

17:38.163 --> 17:41.465
whether or not you choose
to be disgusting tonight

17:41.501 --> 17:44.035
and take
all your clothes off for men,

17:44.236 --> 17:47.372
and crawl around
on your hands and knees,

17:47.510 --> 17:51.088
picking up sweaty dollar
bills from the floor,

17:51.207 --> 17:55.377
you are still welcome for
dinner here.

17:56.307 --> 17:57.823
Well, thank you.

17:58.136 --> 18:00.346
After you shower.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.413
Hey.

18:07.514 --> 18:09.148
Oh, my God, Maxine.

18:09.216 --> 18:12.174
It means so much to me
that you are doing this.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.963
Look, Casey, we need to talk.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.862
We can't just shut each
other out because we disagree.

18:16.939 --> 18:19.299
We are sisters; we need to
learn how to criticize each other

18:19.342 --> 18:20.842
and still have a relationship.

18:21.003 --> 18:22.354
So you're not going out there?

18:22.390 --> 18:24.987
Well, it shouldn't matter
whether or not I go out there.

18:25.023 --> 18:26.185
We need to love each other

18:26.221 --> 18:28.127
and stand by each other
no matter what.

18:28.195 --> 18:29.677
I should be able to call you a slut

18:29.713 --> 18:31.752
and still have dinner with you.

18:32.408 --> 18:34.053
Did you just call me a slut?

18:34.302 --> 18:35.564
Kind of.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.220
Look, my point is, maybe
I am a little bit hard on you

18:38.267 --> 18:39.915
and too overprotective.

18:40.009 --> 18:42.158
But you need to take
responsibility for being the one

18:42.227 --> 18:43.994
who shuts me out every
time things get hard.

18:44.049 --> 18:46.751
Because us not being
close can't be all on me.

18:46.806 --> 18:49.142
Well,
I don't know any other way.

18:49.289 --> 18:50.767
We had terrible parents.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.790
Obviously,
they could have done better.

18:53.130 --> 18:56.315
We're both standing
backstage at a strip club.

18:56.948 --> 18:59.284
Look, no matter what is
going on in your life,

18:59.518 --> 19:02.690
whether or not I agree with it,
I am going to be here.

19:02.869 --> 19:05.204
And if you want us to
have a good relationship,

19:05.272 --> 19:07.190
then you need to be here, too.

19:07.393 --> 19:10.096
Who's ready for amateur night?

19:10.467 --> 19:13.370
Making her
Blue Diamond Strip Club debut,

19:13.647 --> 19:17.817
it's Wet Sprinkle!

19:20.706 --> 19:22.229
Well?

19:26.214 --> 19:28.073
Thanks, fellas. Have a good time.

19:28.362 --> 19:29.940
Hey, my man. I'm looking

19:29.987 --> 19:32.017
for my girlfriend;
she's stripping for amateur night.

19:32.053 --> 19:33.720
Ah, man, I wish you
wouldn't have told me that.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.784
Now I can't let you in here.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.753
What are you talking about?
Why not?

19:37.836 --> 19:40.385
We got a strict no boyfriend
policy on amateur night.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.682
See, when a guy sees his
girl take her clothes off

19:42.737 --> 19:44.745
for the first time in a
room full of strange men,

19:44.829 --> 19:46.823
they got a tendency
to shoot up the place.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.169
See that bullet hole right there?

19:50.377 --> 19:52.861
That's from a boyfriend in 2010.

19:53.103 --> 19:55.174
Went right by my face.

19:55.642 --> 19:57.931
Anyway, that's why I
can't let you in here.

19:58.674 --> 20:00.290
Jerrod, 
what are you doing here?

20:00.326 --> 20:01.150
Maxine,

20:01.186 --> 20:03.381
I was at home,
just trying to accept this.

20:03.451 --> 20:06.352
And I-I just couldn't,
okay? I love you,

20:06.537 --> 20:07.834
and I don't want to share you.

20:07.870 --> 20:09.981
So please tell me you
didn't go through with this.

20:11.162 --> 20:12.537
I almost didn't.

20:12.575 --> 20:14.242
Maxine, what the hell?

20:14.318 --> 20:17.834
I told you I needed
to strip to save my family.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.756
Nobody has ever had to
strip to save their family.

20:23.045 --> 20:25.014
I met a lot of
single mothers backstage

20:25.076 --> 20:26.795
who would beg to differ.

20:27.254 --> 20:28.637
Well...

20:29.082 --> 20:31.392
did you make a lot of money?

20:33.392 --> 20:35.229
Jerrod...

20:36.291 --> 20:38.619
we can finally go to Hawaii.

20:39.556 --> 20:43.448
All right, well, let's get
out of here, Wet Sprinkle.

21:02.069 --> 21:04.390
We don't have to ever speak of this.
