00:16.850 --> 00:17.851
Huh?

00:26.609 --> 00:28.194
What's going on?

00:28.194 --> 00:29.279
Why--

00:29.279 --> 00:31.531
Ahhh!

00:40.457 --> 00:42.417
You stole from us.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.461
You committed
a litany of crimes.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.796
with our technology.

00:46.796 --> 00:51.050
You destroyed property
and endangered citizens.

00:51.050 --> 00:55.930
But today, you will repay
your debt to society.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.640
Ivo?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.852
All right,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:00.852 --> 01:02.729
it's moving day.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.928
- <i>Come on!</i>
- <i>Help!</i>

01:35.887 --> 01:37.639
Hello?

01:37.639 --> 01:40.225
<i>Come away
from the window.</i>

01:41.351 --> 01:42.393
Hello?

01:43.937 --> 01:44.979
- <i>Help!</i>
- Huh?

01:50.109 --> 01:52.737
Help, help!

01:52.737 --> 01:54.614
Help me.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.536
Oh, no!
The brakes aren't working!

02:03.665 --> 02:04.833
Help me!

02:07.126 --> 02:08.586
Oh, my gosh!

02:12.924 --> 02:14.968
<i>Negative.</i>

02:14.968 --> 02:17.929
<i>After this operation,
Superman will cease
to be a problem.</i>

02:18.847 --> 02:20.181
<i>Permanently.</i>

02:21.057 --> 02:21.933
The General.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.101
Help. Help, please.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.365
Hey, Clark.
I'm back from my parents.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.118
Sorry if you tried to call.
I forgot my charger.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.411
Oh. Hmm.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.413
500 new followers?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.249
"Superman put out
the house fire!"

02:46.249 --> 02:47.834
"Superman flew us to school."

02:47.834 --> 02:50.545
"Flamebro!
Superman saved my uncle!"

02:51.170 --> 02:52.046
Wow!

02:52.046 --> 02:53.840
Clark's been busy.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.425
Oh! You have no idea, Jimmy.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.093
I heard you all the way
from the warehouse district.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.469
There was almost
a bulldozer accident.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.096
I stopped it.
I have super-hearing.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.098
This is so going on Flamebird.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.808
What's super-hearing like?

03:03.808 --> 03:06.519
It's nuts! I can...
I can hear a... A...

03:06.519 --> 03:07.729
A cat in tree.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.607
I can hear everyone.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.192
And Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

03:13.192 --> 03:14.819
They have problems.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.613
Hmm.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.453
Uh, you've been
sleeping much, buddy?

03:23.453 --> 03:24.829
Not for a few days,

03:24.829 --> 03:27.290
but
that's not important,

03:27.290 --> 03:30.251
because I heard him.
The General.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.628
The guy who attacked you?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.630
And destroyed Cadmus
and kidnapped Heat Wave,

03:33.630 --> 03:36.299
Intergang and every other
person who touched his
crazy tech weapons.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.134
He's in the city
and he's planning something.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.552
I can't stop until I find him.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.471
Okay.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.972
This is a lot for a Monday.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.767
Um, maybe we just
go to work and...

03:45.767 --> 03:47.810
Oh, Lois, I almost forgot.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.354
Wait!

03:51.898 --> 03:54.025
One million new followers?

03:54.692 --> 03:55.568
Uh...

03:55.568 --> 03:56.819
Never mind.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.404
Keep doing what
you're doing, buddy.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.501
What?

04:28.309 --> 04:29.310
Clark...

04:42.907 --> 04:44.075
That can't be you.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.743
Can it?

04:45.743 --> 04:46.869
Lane.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.373
Lane! Good, you're here.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.582
Come with me. Quickly.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.417
Why?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.918
Uh, what's going on?

04:56.421 --> 04:59.090
Today, I need you to assist
our guest editorial writer,

04:59.090 --> 05:01.467
but I also need you
to not freak out.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.803
Uh, why would I freak out?

05:05.388 --> 05:07.223
- It's Vicki Vale!
- I know.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.226
The reporter who broke
the Queen Industries
inheritance scandal.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.728
Who took down the Falcones.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.397
Perry, do you even know
how many awards she's won?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.065
Yes,
it's very impressive, but--

05:16.065 --> 05:17.734
I have a poster of her
in my bedroom.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.611
Neat. I've got a poster
of me in my office

05:20.611 --> 05:23.156
and I've lost track
on the awards side.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.866
But who's really counting?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.576
Other than the
prize committees.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.785
Okay, Vicki, meet--

05:27.785 --> 05:30.496
Lois Lane, it's an honor!

05:30.496 --> 05:32.081
Nice to meet you too.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.667
You know, when Per-Bear here
gave me a call,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.086
begging me to write
an editorial for the <i>Planet.</i>

05:37.086 --> 05:40.298
- Not begging, offering.
- I said, why not?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.883
We knew each other in college.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.053
I ran the number one student
newspaper in the country.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.096
Hmm, don't know
who was number two.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.848
Me. That was me.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.185
Hey, I still have
pictures from then.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.437
This is amazing!

05:54.437 --> 05:56.647
And there's Olsen.
He'll be your photographer.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.649
Fantastic.

05:58.649 --> 06:02.904
Look, Vicki's a lot,
but she's thinking of leaving
the <i>Gotham Gazette.</i>

06:02.904 --> 06:04.113
And if she does,

06:04.113 --> 06:06.741
I want her here
winning us awards.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.117
So today, I need you to do

06:08.117 --> 06:10.286
whatever you can
to keep her happy.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.370
Got it?

06:11.370 --> 06:13.122
That will not be
a problem, Chief.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.165
Don't call me that.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.835
I will crush this assignment.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.380
Gang's all here. Great.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.840
- Let's go.
- Of course.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.176
What story are we
chasing, Miss Vale?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.303
Please, Lois, call me Vicki.

06:27.303 --> 06:31.599
And we're writing about
the number one greatest
danger to Metropolis...

06:32.183 --> 06:33.267
Superman.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.644
What?

06:37.855 --> 06:39.982
Okay, General,
where are you?

06:41.484 --> 06:42.985
<i>Has anybody heard
from anybody?</i>

06:42.985 --> 06:44.570
<i>Sorry.</i>

06:44.570 --> 06:46.614
<i>What do you mean,
you lost him?</i>

06:46.614 --> 06:48.950
<i>We need to know
his whereabouts.</i>

06:48.950 --> 06:49.867
Lost?

06:50.409 --> 06:51.577
Lost who?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.503
Where are you?

07:01.462 --> 07:02.964
I can't find you.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.966
Hey there.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.884
Hey, it's okay.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.469
My name is Superman.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.804
I'll find your parents.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.055
What's your name?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.474
- Libby.
- Give me one second, Libby.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.187
<i>What?
No, no, please don't.</i>

07:18.187 --> 07:19.355
<i>What's going on?</i>

07:19.355 --> 07:21.566
<i>Libby? Libby!</i>

07:23.109 --> 07:24.694
I've got 'em. You ready?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.244
Honey, where are you?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.872
Libby!

07:35.872 --> 07:37.623
- Oh!
- Mommy!

07:42.962 --> 07:45.006
<i>On a crime spree downtown,</i>

07:45.006 --> 07:46.465
<i>citizens are urged
to stay indoors</i>

07:46.465 --> 07:48.509
<i>as he may be armed
and dangerous.</i>

07:50.928 --> 07:53.598
<i>Intergang.
The Invisible Man.</i>

07:55.725 --> 07:58.311
He's the one
The General's looking for.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.982
Superman's an
overpowered vigilante
who doesn't answer to anyone.

08:02.982 --> 08:07.069
Trust me, kids,
no one puts on that
big a show of being good

08:07.069 --> 08:08.946
unless they're
hiding something.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.032
That's not true.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.243
I mean, he has secrets,
but he wouldn't, um...

08:14.243 --> 08:16.329
He just-- He wants to help.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.249
A superpowered being shows up,
and all he wants is
to pull cats out of trees?

08:20.249 --> 08:22.460
Yeah,
I'm not buying it.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.879
I've got that award
feeling about this.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.757
We'll interview people,
get the dirt.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.509
Show everyone,
Superman isn't to be trusted.

08:30.509 --> 08:31.510
No, you can't.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.388
Excuse me?

08:34.388 --> 08:38.726
What I mean is,
you should let us
set up interviews for you.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.603
That's why you
wanted our help, right?

08:40.603 --> 08:43.648
We know Metropolis
and the people in it
better than anyone.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.859
Well, that, and it
annoyed Perry.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.277
We call him Chief
and he hates it.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.862
I love it.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.990
All right, kids,
what do you got?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.787
Captain Immonen,
fifth unit pilot.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.414
Superman saved my life
when my engine stalled out.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.209
Without him,
I wouldn't be here today.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.044
Oh.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.338
Such a nice boy.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.757
And he carries my groceries.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.802
Flip Johnson.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.804
Woman of business.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.681
Mm-hmm.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.433
A literal child. Okay.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.603
And what is your
relationship to Superman?

09:22.603 --> 09:24.981
He saved Flip's life. Twice!

09:24.981 --> 09:28.109
And he let Patti interview him
from the <i>Newskid Newspaper.</i>

09:28.109 --> 09:30.194
- The what?
- I'm glad you asked.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.946
The <i>Newskid Newspaper</i>
is the latest...

09:31.946 --> 09:33.489
- It's Clark.
- The people...

09:35.658 --> 09:36.867
Sorry, I don't have much time.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.411
An Invisible Man
is running around,

09:38.411 --> 09:40.204
and I think he's
connected to The General.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.081
I need to find him.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.667
Ooh. I bet one of my
one million followers
will know where he is.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.586
Now two million!

09:50.339 --> 09:52.174
Are you okay?

09:52.174 --> 09:55.011
Birdwatchers say
an invisible force
broke the window

09:55.011 --> 09:57.888
at Morrison's Pawn Shop
less than a minute ago.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.516
Thanks, Jimmy!
Lois, I'll be fine.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.642
Be careful.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.522
Hey, what are you two doing?

10:06.522 --> 10:08.357
Oh.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.693
Uh, just, uh, talking about
who your next interview
should be.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.862
Oh, I've got that covered.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.948
Let's go meet
my final interview subject.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.200
Superman's no hero.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.869
He's the end of the world.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.203
Is he now?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.496
Tell me everything.

10:42.058 --> 10:42.975
Wait!

10:44.935 --> 10:47.271
You say
Superman is dangerous?

10:47.271 --> 10:48.564
Are you kidding?

10:48.564 --> 10:51.150
Look around.
Superman is a criminal.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.486
He destroyed this tower,
bankrupted Amazo Tech

10:53.486 --> 10:56.572
and put thousands out of work,
including me.

10:56.572 --> 11:00.618
Wow. I see this
and I see a level
of destruction

11:00.618 --> 11:03.329
no human could ever achieve.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.914
Exactly.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.833
He shows up out of the blue,
same time as that crazy tech--

11:07.833 --> 11:10.503
And what a coincidence that is.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.756
Superman wiped out
good American jobs.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.759
He turned your city
into a war zone.

11:16.759 --> 11:20.429
At what point will he destroy
the rest of Metropolis?

11:20.429 --> 11:22.765
He's not normal,
like you or me.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.058
Anything's possible.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.018
I can't believe this!
He's Superman.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.270
He uses his powers
to save people!

11:28.270 --> 11:31.440
Oh, he does?
And what happens when
he decides that having powers

11:31.440 --> 11:33.943
means he doesn't have
to follow our laws anymore?

11:33.943 --> 11:38.239
If he really wanted to hurt us,
what could we do about it?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.121
With how powerful Superman is,

11:45.121 --> 11:48.874
just him having a bad day
could spell the end for us.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.794
Can you really say
we're safer with him overhead?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.045
I...

11:55.965 --> 11:58.008
I think I've made my point.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.260
No, that's not--

11:59.260 --> 12:01.804
I know Superman
and he wouldn't do that.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.931
I know he wouldn't.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.059
Well, not all of us
share your faith.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.855
Beautiful.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.524
I got what I needed.
Thanks, Alex. I'll be in touch.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.652
Wait! He's a biased source.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.405
Hmm? Unlike your contacts?

12:19.405 --> 12:21.574
That... That's different.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.492
Vicki, you can't publish this.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.911
You want to be number one?

12:25.911 --> 12:28.038
You don't get there
by writing fluff.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.707
You go for blood.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.792
That's something
Perry never understood.

12:32.751 --> 12:33.794
Do you?

12:45.222 --> 12:47.183
Ahhh!

12:57.193 --> 12:59.612
Wait, I just want to talk.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.700
No!

13:16.670 --> 13:17.713
- Huh?
- What the heck!

13:17.713 --> 13:19.256
You could've killed someone.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.845
Get away from him.
He's dangerous.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.515
There's a huge accident
and Superman caused it.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.226
I'm... I'm sorry.
I was trying to save...

13:35.022 --> 13:35.981
I'm sorry.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.990
We need to...
We need to stop her

13:44.990 --> 13:47.576
or talk to Perry or...

13:48.577 --> 13:50.079
We need to get to Clark.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.628
- Clark!
- Where are you?

14:04.927 --> 14:08.097
Clark. What is going on?

14:08.097 --> 14:10.599
I ran into some trouble.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.268
You ran into a truck.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.437
I didn't mean to,
but Mist ran into traffic--

14:15.437 --> 14:17.648
If I hadn't jumped in,
he'd... He'd be dead.

14:17.648 --> 14:21.277
And this is my one shot
to find The General.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.238
And if you find him, what then?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.948
You're going to fight
the US military?

14:25.948 --> 14:28.701
That man kidnapped
people, Lois.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.785
I have to stop him.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.579
You're burning yourself out.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.747
And I can see what
they're saying about you.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.000
It's not good.
Wait!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.294
"Superman's dangerous."

14:38.294 --> 14:41.130
"He should go back
to where he came from."

14:41.130 --> 14:43.674
I've... scared them.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.886
And I'm going
to have to fix that.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.221
But right now,

14:49.221 --> 14:50.973
I need to find
The General before--

14:50.973 --> 14:52.474
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.729
At least not right now, uh...

14:56.729 --> 15:01.108
Take a break
from being Superman
and just try being normal.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.194
Normal.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.240
Clark. No, I... I...

15:14.079 --> 15:16.332
Come on, Kent.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.499
Focus.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.131
Ah!

15:27.009 --> 15:28.093
Ahhh!

15:28.093 --> 15:30.095
Don't be afraid.
I'm here to talk.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.228
Leave me alone!

15:38.228 --> 15:39.813
I'm not trying to hurt you.

15:39.813 --> 15:40.898
Then let me go!

15:40.898 --> 15:42.441
I need to save my sister.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.027
Your sister?
What happened to her?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.571
They grabbed us
after you ruined our bank job.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.366
<i>I got away, but they got
Siobhan and Albert.</i>

15:50.366 --> 15:53.911
<i>They took him
into an underground facility
with their other prisoners.</i>

15:55.829 --> 15:58.874
<i>I found out that they're
moving everyone out today.</i>

15:58.874 --> 16:00.542
To some new location.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.837
If I don't break them out now,
I might never find them again.

16:03.837 --> 16:06.507
You can do whatever
you want with me after.

16:06.507 --> 16:10.552
Just... Just let me
spring my sister
and my best friend first.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.637
I can't let you do that.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.599
Not alone.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.726
If you show me where
they're holding her,
I'll help you get them back.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.654
We're too late!

16:28.654 --> 16:29.738
No, we're not.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.998
Everyone, hold on.
I'm here to help.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.717
But you're prisoners...

16:49.717 --> 16:52.428
Oh, we're on
a work-release program.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.179
Can you guess what the job is?

16:54.179 --> 16:56.557
It's getting back at you!

17:02.771 --> 17:03.897
Ahhh!

17:18.037 --> 17:21.290
Hey, buddy.

17:21.290 --> 17:26.754
Did you really think
you could ruin my life
without any consequences?

17:52.237 --> 17:53.697
Ahhh!

18:05.167 --> 18:08.837
I found a new backer
for my Parasite tech.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.340
And they hate you
as much as I do.

18:14.134 --> 18:17.346
Oh, no.
I'm not done with you yet.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.075
We can't stop Clark,
but we can stop Vicki.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.451
We'll talk to Perry.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.954
Whoa! Did you see
what Vicki Vale just posted?

18:49.044 --> 18:52.005
"The <i>Gotham Gazette's</i>
new Editor-in-chief!"

18:52.005 --> 18:54.299
She used us to get promoted.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.843
This is going to hurt Clark.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.554
Lois.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.931
<i>Ahhh!</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:12.901
That's the west entrance.
Come on.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.030
No!

20:36.818 --> 20:38.654
Ahhh!

20:42.324 --> 20:44.409
I told you, Superman.

20:45.243 --> 20:48.205
This ends when I'm done!

20:58.882 --> 21:00.133
That's enough.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.847
Stand down, Ivo.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.936
Ahhh!

21:14.648 --> 21:17.859
You're done when
I say you're done, Ivo.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.284
Why are you doing this?

21:26.284 --> 21:28.120
Because you're no hero.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.498
You are the end of the world.

21:31.498 --> 21:35.210
- No, I only want to--
- Shut him up.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.638
No.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.650
No.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.068
They've taken Clark.
