WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:12.303
Let me ask you all something.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.684
What are we doing here?

00:22.605 --> 00:23.565
[inhales]

00:24.858 --> 00:26.317
Like, right now?

00:27.068 --> 00:29.696
I mean, this operation.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.242
Yes. You.

00:34.325 --> 00:37.412
Trying to… get the bad guy.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.955
Ah. How?

00:40.582 --> 00:42.375
Yes! Yes, go ahead.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.044
Uh, by following the money.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.505
And what would get in the way of that?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.383
Um…

00:51.301 --> 00:55.180
If you don't… what?

00:55.263 --> 00:56.931
We don't…

00:57.015 --> 00:58.516
If you don't…

00:58.600 --> 00:59.851
Show up on time?

01:01.144 --> 01:05.023
-'Cause today we got here before you did.
-No. No. Uh-uh.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.818
If you don't tell us…

01:12.030 --> 01:14.741
that you're screwing the target.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.118
[gasps]

01:18.078 --> 01:20.914
Yeah! Why didn't you tell us?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.583
Um, because I'm not.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.710
Your wire would disagree.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.635
Okay. I'm not screwing anyone, all right?

01:33.718 --> 01:37.055
Except your friends,
if you wanna keep this deal.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.848
You did it with him again, dude?

01:38.932 --> 01:40.308
Not "it."

01:40.391 --> 01:41.476
Then what?

01:42.685 --> 01:44.103
You know, the other thing.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.648
Did it involve your vagina?

01:46.731 --> 01:47.857
Sort of.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.401
And his… penis.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.486
No!

01:52.070 --> 01:54.114
So, his, mmm…

01:54.197 --> 01:55.365
No.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.283
So, his, uh…

01:58.451 --> 02:00.829
Okay, I was trying to distract him.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.997
By trapping his fingers.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.083
Because he was going to see your wire.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.376
Unbelievable.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.962
In his <i>abuelita's</i> house.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.756
I really don't care
how many bases you rounded.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.424
They just call her "Grandma."

02:13.508 --> 02:15.301
Oh, the boss, right?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.719
How was I supposed to know?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.721
Now we're right back where we started.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.016
-None of this is my fault!
-What are we supposed to do now?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.852
'Cause we really need this deal.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.271
You are back on the bench.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.356
One of you two will have to pinch-hit.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.150
Now, I'm getting confused

02:30.233 --> 02:33.945
because the baseball stuff
is blurring with the sexy stuff and…

02:34.028 --> 02:37.282
No part of that man
is getting any of this.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.538
Her wire is still hot.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.290
[Dave] Anything good?

02:45.373 --> 02:47.750
Well, Grandma loves <i>Two And A Half Men.</i>

02:47.834 --> 02:49.836
Um, she's totally sick of C.P.K.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.255
And her foot doctor
appointment's on Tuesday.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.882
[Dave] What about our guy?

02:53.965 --> 02:56.050
Oh, he's gonna need her.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.348
Just don't ask me to wear a wire again.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.644
What were you guys talking about?

03:14.652 --> 03:15.528
[Stan] Hey.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.574
Little Money wants me
to cut the crusts off now.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.285
Thought about
how we gonna sell these things?

03:22.368 --> 03:24.037
You ask me, it's the best part.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.248
[sighs] All right. Check this.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.333
[sniffles]

03:30.835 --> 03:32.629
Mmm, that's swank.

03:32.712 --> 03:36.507
Four bedrooms,
open floor plan, mad curb appeal.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.426
-Yeah, who's staying there?
-We are.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.220
-It's right by Harry's school.
-Mmm-hmm.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.930
With all those rich moms,

03:42.013 --> 03:44.015
it's the kinda place
you buy a top-notch purse.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.600
If you got two G's a night.

03:45.683 --> 03:48.895
One of the girls at the salon
cleans these pads in between guests.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.731
-Won't they know we don't live there?
-Not if we say we do.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.816
Nah, I can't fake that kinda money.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.819
All these bitches care about
are their houses, their charities,

03:56.903 --> 03:58.238
and what everyone else has.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.489
Exactly.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.658
Okay, you can just be my arm candy.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.326
[sighs]

04:03.409 --> 04:05.453
Hey, it's your ass on the line.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.206
[sighs]

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
-Beth can't be a part of this.
-Okay.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.589
-She makes everything about her.
-You're right.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.341
-You're not hearing me.
-I am.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.760
-She does whatever she wants, whenever.
-I know.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.136
-Rules don't apply.
-Right.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.514
Then a bullet in your other knee.
I'm back in jail.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.349
-And she's living large.
-Yes.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.144
She can't even hear about this.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.271
I agree.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.609
-I'm talking about Beth Boland.
-Yep.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.194
-Your homie.
-Got it.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.198
-Really?
-She doesn't tell me everything <i>she</i> does.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.701
Oh…

04:45.535 --> 04:47.996
Okay. Good.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.332
They were out of Windex.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.921
That boy is onto something.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.132
That's good as hell.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.927
Oh, no.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.095
Oh, yeah.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.513
Mugs?

05:05.596 --> 05:07.098
Sit down.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.601
I was really hopin' for more
of a to-go kind of coffee situation.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.396
[sighs]

05:14.355 --> 05:17.275
Just, uh… Just lay it on me, bruh.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.612
You were right.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.115
Hmm, exciting. About what?

05:26.909 --> 05:30.121
-I wanna pull Ben out of St. Anne's.
-Wait. What?

05:30.204 --> 05:32.457
I don't want him to turn into a rich dick.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.418
-But you wanted him to go.
-I changed my mind, okay?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.003
What, now that he has friends?

05:37.086 --> 05:38.379
This place is evil.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.006
He has teachers that love him.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.967
-They'll love him in public school.
-What about lacrosse?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.802
He can play lacrosse anywhere.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.472
-He just got into the playoffs.
-Fine. All right.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.099
Fine. But you deal
with all the birthday stuff.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.602
What does that have to do with anything?

05:52.685 --> 05:54.979
Remember Keela Shuggert's birthday
last weekend?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.189
The Swifty karaoke?

05:56.272 --> 05:58.399
Mmm-hmm.
Turns out it wasn't a theme party.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.109
Taylor Swift actually showed up.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.362
Taylor Swift came
to a 14-year-old's birthday party?

06:03.446 --> 06:06.657
Yeah. And she played the whole <i>1989</i> album.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.911
-Did she do "Out of the Woods"?
-The whole album.

06:09.994 --> 06:12.538
-What about "Clean"?
-The whole <i>1989</i> album. Okay?

06:12.622 --> 06:16.042
All of it. Every single song.
Then she stayed and ate cake.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.712
-My God.
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.800
So, what's Ben gonna expect
for his birthday? Selena Gomez?

06:24.592 --> 06:26.803
You think she charges
by the song, or by the hour…

06:26.886 --> 06:28.971
I don't care.
That's not the point. The point is,

06:29.055 --> 06:32.016
Ben can't think
this is what birthday parties are.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.770
He can't be a dick.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.064
No. So we gotta pull him out.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.567
-Right.
-Stat.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.029
What's faster than stat?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.657
I don't know. You'll figure it out.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.367
Hang on.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.745
-Well, you gotta tell him.
-Why me?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.288
'Cause I'm eatin' the tuition.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.917
[sighs] Jesus.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.796
-This sucks.
-Yeah.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.925
They forgot to put
the cinnamon in it. That's what it is.

07:06.008 --> 07:06.884
[sighs]

07:10.138 --> 07:10.972
[sighs]

07:11.556 --> 07:16.269
Hey, I fed the kids fish sticks,
but I told them it was mozzarella.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.149
We should, uh,
get Kenny to cut his fingernails.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.484
Why? He looks like a wizard.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.987
Are you going out?

07:26.070 --> 07:28.156
Yeah, I'm gonna run some errands.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.198
Like…

07:32.118 --> 07:33.327
[whispers] Like errands?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.037
Why are you whispering?

07:35.663 --> 07:39.625
It's just your hair and your makeup
and you smell good, you know.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.294
No, I don't.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.422
Is this, like, an op?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.388
-Okay, between us.
-Yeah.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.806
-You can't tell.
-I won't.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.600
Swear on Emma's life.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.144
Can I swear on Kenny's?

07:58.227 --> 07:59.979
-Seriously.
-[chuckles] I'm sorry. Yes.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.397
I won't tell. I promise.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.117
I'm going to the grocery store.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.206
[chuckles]

08:23.711 --> 08:24.962
[laughs]

08:25.671 --> 08:27.924
[soft rock music playing over speakers]

08:33.262 --> 08:34.597
[Rio] What are you drinking?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.062
-Something strong.
-Oh, come on, now.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.233
So, dinner was, uh…

08:47.318 --> 08:49.445
fun, yeah?

08:52.865 --> 08:54.158
Parts of it.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.787
We got a problem, though.

09:01.916 --> 09:02.917
What's that?

09:15.429 --> 09:16.264
[sniffles]

09:21.686 --> 09:23.896
Grandma was pissed we missed dessert.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.528
[chuckles]

09:32.697 --> 09:35.324
-What'd you tell her?
-That you're a fan, too.

09:38.744 --> 09:39.870
Tell her thank you.

09:39.954 --> 09:44.458
-One more thing, though, yeah?
-Never mind. I'll just write her a note.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.418
I need a bank.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.632
Maybe try your mattress this time.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.884
A safety deposit box would be even better.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.554
Not when your husband's
under house arrest for laundering money.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.222
That's why it can't be you.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.893
What about the other girls?

10:03.519 --> 10:05.688
Nah. Same kind of heat.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.565
Okay, who's it supposed to be?

10:07.648 --> 10:08.899
It don't matter.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.987
Long as they're in mom jeans,
no one will think twice.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.286
Why jeans?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.669
'Cause a dress like that
draws the wrong kind of attention.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.935
She's not a mom.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.938
She just needs to get him
to talk about his money.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.983
-She doesn't look like a mom.
-They record that, and boom!

10:51.067 --> 10:53.903
-She doesn't even walk like a mom.
-Racketeering, tax evasion--

10:53.986 --> 10:55.529
'Cause she's not a mom.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.657
[sighs]

10:57.740 --> 10:59.450
She <i>has</i> a mom.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.537
No gummy bears
before night-night, little fella.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.290
Don't run with scissors, tiger.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.583
I'm just gettin' my mom on.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.001
[chuckles] Hmm?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.963
We're so gonna die.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.632
How hard can it be?

11:14.715 --> 11:17.510
Literally nothing gets past this guy.

11:18.719 --> 11:19.970
So, teach me.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.349
-How many kids?
-Two.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.267
-Names?
-Tom and Sally.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.061
-[honks horn]
-[scoffs] 'Cause it's 1958.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.605
-Bryer and Julian.
-Okay.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.941
-Bryer with a "Y."
-How old's Julian?

11:32.024 --> 11:34.235
-Um… Um, one and a half.
-Quick.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.319
-[honks horn]
-In months.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.071
-Always in months.
-What?

11:37.154 --> 11:39.240
[Beth] Everything
under two years is in months.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.741
Over two years is in years.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.201
-Why?
-Never ask why.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.869
-Why?
-Only kids ask why.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.080
Let's go again. Start from the top.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.832
[French electro-pop song playing]

12:12.815 --> 12:14.233
Now it's a mom bag.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.693
When's bedtime?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.195
-7:00. 8:00.
-[honks horn]

12:18.279 --> 12:19.530
I go to bed at 9:00.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.448
Trick question.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.367
There's no point in setting one
'cause they'll never listen.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.553
[Ruby] Hmm.

12:43.679 --> 12:44.972
Do you wanna live?

12:45.055 --> 12:46.682
It's so gross.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.146
-It's 2:15. What are you late for?
-School pickup.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.606
-[honks horn]
-Just pickup.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.691
How many times
are we gonna go around this?

12:55.774 --> 12:58.944
-No one says "school."
-[whispers] Okay. Just… Pick up.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.947
Oh, no, don't give him that.
It's too much sugar.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.657
The bad kind, not the good kind.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.160
You know what,
give him the sweet potatoes in the fridge.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.287
I puréed them myself. Don't use the pouch.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.623
I started adding tarragon
to introduce spice.

13:10.706 --> 13:11.832
[whispers] Sorry I'm late.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.335
Marty doesn't know
what to feed the kids. [chuckles]

13:14.418 --> 13:16.879
Just do bath time
and I'll be back in time for stories.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.380
All right. Love you. Bye.

13:19.423 --> 13:20.257
[exhales sharply]

13:20.341 --> 13:23.594
So, Julian has a temp. 102.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.763
And a rash which I was freaking out

13:25.846 --> 13:28.766
'cause I thought it was measles
'cause he just had his MMR,

13:28.849 --> 13:30.184
but turns out it's roseola,

13:30.267 --> 13:32.686
which Bryer never had.
She did have foot-and-mouth,

13:32.770 --> 13:35.481
so I thought it was that at first,
but I was wrong. [chuckles]

13:35.564 --> 13:37.942
Poor little monkey. Mmm… [sighs]

13:38.025 --> 13:41.946
Anyway, I forgot to write down
what the pharmacist told me to get.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.490
Where is that pen? Oh, shoot.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.038
Ah…

13:51.121 --> 13:52.623
[exhales] Here it is.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.172
She's ready.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.882
[vacuum whirring]

14:11.850 --> 14:13.143
Did you fix it?

14:13.727 --> 14:15.271
It wasn't broken.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.148
Danny said he couldn't do his book report.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.443
Well, all he had to do
was replace the ink cartridge.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.532
What is the Aqua Joy 2000?

14:26.615 --> 14:29.660
It's the most powerful
home spa on the market.

14:29.743 --> 14:30.703
[ankle monitor beeps]

14:30.786 --> 14:32.913
Yeah, but why does it say
that we bought it?

14:32.997 --> 14:33.956
'Cause we did.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.419
-We need it.
-You said no one needs a hot tub.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.755
That was before my wife
decided to go all Donnie Brasco on us.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.467
What are you talking about?
This is money we don't have.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.803
For starters, it's very loud, right?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.598
So if you and the girls ever
need to get into a conversation

14:50.681 --> 14:52.182
you don't want others to hear--

14:52.266 --> 14:53.434
No one's listening.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.560
How do you know?

14:54.643 --> 14:56.270
Because I'm the informant.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.231
I can't risk it, okay?

14:59.315 --> 15:00.316
You?

15:02.818 --> 15:03.819
Yeah, me.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.739
-I'm taking all the risk.
-[scoffs]

15:07.448 --> 15:09.450
Well, I have the most to lose.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.705
But we don't need this.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.421
Well… I need Nevada.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.392
[door opens]

15:38.062 --> 15:39.188
Here she is.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.650
-Hey.
-Morning, ladies.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.818
-[Ruby] Morning.
-I added the chunky necklace.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.236
It's great, right?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.989
-No.
-It's not. It's bad.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.492
[chuckles]

15:52.117 --> 15:53.035
[clears throat]

15:54.286 --> 15:56.080
Beep twice if you can hear me.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.291
[car honks]

16:00.292 --> 16:01.293
Showtime.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.421
[scoffs] Is it in the salt
and pepper shaker?

16:04.505 --> 16:05.965
All of it.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.885
Can he hear
when I talk into the condiments?

16:10.719 --> 16:12.638
All of it. Yeah.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.101
Beep three times if you can hear me.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.360
[car honks three times]

16:26.443 --> 16:28.362
-Oh, my God. Damn.
-[Ruby] Hmm.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.532
-Up, ladies.
-[Phoebe] What?

16:31.615 --> 16:33.742
Can't seat you
till your whole party's here.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.744
He's just… He's parking.

16:36.870 --> 16:41.667
[softly] Actually, I spoke to the manager
yesterday about reserving this table.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.628
Well, he ain't here today.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.964
We really need this table.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.757
So do those folks.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.720
But there's, like,
150 other tables in here.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.596
This is their favorite.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.889
[Beth scoffs]

16:57.933 --> 17:00.269
What if we ordered for him?

17:00.352 --> 17:03.230
-Don't count.
-Why doesn't that count?

17:03.313 --> 17:06.233
Because we don't seat
tuna melts, we seat people.

17:06.316 --> 17:10.029
Okay. We're not
actually here to have lunch.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.865
Well, what the heck you doin', then?

17:13.615 --> 17:15.284
-[Annie clears throat]
-[door opens]

17:16.618 --> 17:17.911
-[Rio] Ladies.
-[waitress] Hmm.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.874
[exhales]

17:23.083 --> 17:26.003
Round of Arnold Palmers? Thank you.

17:26.086 --> 17:29.465
And you can just leave out
the iced tea from mine. Thanks.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.176
So… lemonade.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.264
-This is my friend.
-I'm Carolyn. With a "Y." [chuckles]

17:39.349 --> 17:41.560
Oh. So, how do y'all know each other?

17:41.643 --> 17:43.353
-Pickup.
-Garden class.

17:43.437 --> 17:47.441
[chuckles] I mean, well,
I know her first from school.

17:47.524 --> 17:51.528
Yeah, she was the only other mom
who would rosé all day with me, so…

17:51.612 --> 17:52.488
[both chuckle]

17:52.571 --> 17:54.323
And then she did wonders
with my perennials.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.657
-Stop.
-[Beth] You did.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.701
You should see
what she can do with a topiary.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.286
You'd be like… Psh!

17:59.369 --> 18:01.371
I run a small landscaping business

18:01.455 --> 18:06.126
when I'm not schlepping Bryer
and Julian off to playdates, and Gymboree

18:06.210 --> 18:07.586
and toddler tunes--

18:07.669 --> 18:10.672
[spluttering] Then we've all been
great friends ever since.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.216
Yes.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.553
-Cool.
-[Phoebe chuckles]

18:19.431 --> 18:20.599
Way cool.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.187
So, she's trying to grow her business

18:25.270 --> 18:28.649
which makes her
sort of perfect for our arrangement.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.490
So, what do you want me to do?

18:40.661 --> 18:43.038
Well, I don't know about you guys,

18:43.122 --> 18:45.874
but, um, I can't talk shop
on an empty stomach.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.501
Oh…

18:55.175 --> 18:56.176
[waitress] Y'all ready?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.678
Ready if you guys are.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.138
-Sure.
-Yeah.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.723
I could be ready. Just…

19:01.807 --> 19:04.476
Uh, I'll do a BLT.
Bacon extra crispy, please.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.436
White or wheat?

19:06.520 --> 19:07.729
[Rio] Surprise me.

19:07.813 --> 19:12.776
I'll just take a Cobb salad. In fact,
do you guys all just want Cobb salads?

19:12.860 --> 19:14.069
-Yeah.
-[Annie] Mmm, yummy.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
-Read my mind.
-Love Cobb.

19:17.739 --> 19:18.866
Thank you.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.287
So…

19:24.872 --> 19:29.209
What, do you wanna
just have her stash a bunch of cash…

19:29.293 --> 19:30.377
[Rio] Oh, um…

19:30.460 --> 19:33.297
Miss, could you
wrap all that to go for us?

19:34.256 --> 19:35.507
Thank you.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.761
Where are we going?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.013
To her house.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.600
Oh…

19:46.935 --> 19:47.895
Why?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.940
You know, you never know
who's listening around here.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.443
Well, we could go to my house.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.111
-Way closer.
-It's, like, right…

19:56.195 --> 19:57.529
-Yeah.
-Sounds good.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.031
Nah.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.244
I wanna see her place.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.517
How much further?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.646
Uh, just ahead.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.647
And then?

20:32.522 --> 20:33.941
Just a few blocks.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.074
[typing on phone]

20:50.624 --> 20:52.459
Hey, why don't we just talk in here?

20:53.418 --> 20:56.296
Yeah. I mean, it's just us.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.174
-Super private.
-We're close?

21:02.886 --> 21:04.012
We're here.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.107
[Phoebe] <i>They're in here somewhere.</i>

21:19.820 --> 21:21.071
Ha…

21:21.655 --> 21:22.990
Could just knock.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.158
Oh, my husband's sleeping.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.576
At noon?

21:29.871 --> 21:33.709
Yeah, he's not feeling well.
Yeah. He got it from the kids.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.711
Yeah, what did the whole soccer team.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.631
Must've left them inside.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.342
Ugh, that's a shame.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.927
Why don't we go to the park?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.429
-Oh, dine al fresco.
-Oh, yeah.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.723
Yeah, they have those,
you know, picnic tables…

21:50.684 --> 21:52.477
[continues knocking]

21:55.772 --> 21:57.065
[footsteps approaching]

21:58.025 --> 21:59.318
He's up.

22:06.199 --> 22:10.037
-[grunts] Again?
-[Phoebe] I know. Sorry, babe.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.041
Gonna have to put 'em on those big
wooden sticks like at Starbucks.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.087
[chuckles]

22:23.967 --> 22:26.094
[soft pop music playing over speakers]

22:26.803 --> 22:29.681
[woman 1] So, when did you move?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.641
-Recently. Yeah.
-Oh.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.977
Ruby didn't mention it at the recital.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.604
No? Well, yeah, this is real recent.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.688
-Oh.
-Mmm-hmm.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.023
Where is she, anyway?

22:38.857 --> 22:42.110
Oh, she's on her way.
Try some cheese. It's real good.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.696
-Can I get you a refill?
-Ah.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.116
How'd you guys get the wholesale hookup?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.076
Uh…

22:50.368 --> 22:52.621
He would be upset if I told you.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.164
You know Louis Vuitton?

22:55.332 --> 22:56.875
Try some cheese.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.251
-Mmm?
-Mmm.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.380
-Some more?
-[woman 2] Is that real?

23:08.011 --> 23:09.721
A 10-point buck.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.972
[woman 2] Oh, my God.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.433
Oh, he never felt a thing.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.895
Ruby offered to volunteer
at my animal rescue.

23:20.899 --> 23:24.402
Yeah. The poor guy.
He got hit by a gravel truck on I-75.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.905
-[woman 2] Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

23:26.988 --> 23:32.244
We thought this was the best way
to kind of honor his life. Yeah.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.621
-What about the other ones?
-I'm sorry?

23:44.172 --> 23:45.966
Truck killed the whole damn family.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.176
[gasps] Oh…

23:51.805 --> 23:53.014
Try some cheese.

24:06.653 --> 24:07.779
[cell phone vibrating]

24:10.323 --> 24:12.576
Sorry. I didn't expect company.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.081
You got a glass?

24:22.043 --> 24:23.253
Next to the fridge.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.339
Right or left?

24:28.508 --> 24:29.426
Right.

24:34.848 --> 24:38.059
I mean…
I meant my right, not yours. That's…

24:38.143 --> 24:39.269
[both chuckle]

24:40.020 --> 24:41.146
[chuckles]

24:55.160 --> 24:56.745
So, how does this work?

24:57.662 --> 24:59.289
I bring you a duffel,

24:59.372 --> 25:01.666
you keep what's inside till I need it.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.294
What do I get?

25:05.045 --> 25:06.129
Holding fee.

25:07.505 --> 25:08.506
Sounds fair.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.675
I'mma need a key to the box, too.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.802
Okay.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.597
Tomorrow. Noon. Your bank.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.557
Send her the details.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.269
-Oh, I wouldn't drink that, by the way.
-Why not?

25:21.853 --> 25:23.438
Expired a week ago.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.195
That's it. It's over.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.780
We got him, right?

25:33.782 --> 25:36.159
No. He got us.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.663
-He just laid it all out.
-That was practically a confession.

25:39.746 --> 25:42.457
I found this place ten minutes
before you guys got here.

25:42.540 --> 25:45.335
-You didn't have time to wire it?
-I barely had time to text you.

25:46.002 --> 25:46.878
Oh, God.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.173
So it's not over.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.258
[man] Excuse me?

25:51.967 --> 25:53.051
Is it safe?

25:53.134 --> 25:56.763
Oh, yes. I am so sorry about that.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.307
Everyone, meet Irene and Phil.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.936
Your country thanks you for your service.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.689
-[cell phone vibrating]
-[Dave] You have a very lovely home.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.149
My aunt in Nantucket…

26:10.902 --> 26:13.655
[Ruby] Dang! It's archway after archway.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.700
Are you kidding me?

26:17.409 --> 26:19.119
It's like the damn Taj Mahal

26:19.202 --> 26:21.413
if it had two ovens.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.001
Turkey in one,
mac and cheese in the other.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.045
Change the whole Thanksgiving game.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.258
How'd we do?

26:34.217 --> 26:35.719
You mean how did I do?

26:37.470 --> 26:39.139
