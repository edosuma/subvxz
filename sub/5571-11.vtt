WEBVTT

00:08.142 --> 00:10.442
Mr. Palmer, you are slipping.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.780
("Scotland the brave"
ringtone plays)
Hm...

00:17.752 --> 00:19.551
Good morning.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.120
(Man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

00:21.122 --> 00:24.123
Uh, how may I help you?

00:25.326 --> 00:27.359
Yes, this is Dr. Mallard.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.278
(Man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

00:29.279 --> 00:31.196
...about your brother...
(Continues indistinctly)

00:34.135 --> 00:35.434
Wh-when can we meet?

00:35.436 --> 00:36.602
Man: Now?

00:36.604 --> 00:39.071
Yes, yes, now-now is fine.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.173
Well... there's a place

00:41.175 --> 00:43.475
makes a decent cup of tea
in Arlington,

00:43.477 --> 00:45.110
first street
off the military base.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.111
Man: Fine.

00:46.113 --> 00:47.546
I-i can be there
in 20 minutes.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.181
Man:
All right. See you there.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.252
(Elevator bell chimes)

00:55.489 --> 00:57.289
Hello, Dr. Mallard.
Tha...

00:57.291 --> 01:00.125
(Elevator bell chimes)
Oh, don't tell me--
it's dust day.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.261
I'll tell you what, I...

01:10.204 --> 01:13.672
¶ ¶

01:46.874 --> 01:48.874
you're lurking.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.576
I'm gathering data.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.445
Ah, bishop.
Yeah, she just got back
from Oklahoma.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.747
Visiting the fam.
Trying to figure out

01:55.749 --> 01:58.150
whether Jake's still
in the picture or not.
Right.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.219
Still wearing
her wedding ring.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.855
Seems in good spirits.
(Exhales)

02:02.857 --> 02:04.356
She dumped Jake.
They're still married.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.858
What?
What?

02:05.860 --> 02:07.626
This opposite day
or something?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.661
No, every day is opposite day
when it comes to a woman.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.530
Especially a
woman scorned.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.900
McGee: And Jake did some
serious scorning.
He's a dead man.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.435
Bishop's the last
person you'd expect

02:16.437 --> 02:17.870
to slit someone's throat
in their sleep.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.705
Which would make her
the first.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.173
Tony: Now you're catching on.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.474
You know I can hear
every word you're saying.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.478
That's impossible.
I'm whispering.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.646
It's the skylight.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.648
The angle causes

02:29.650 --> 02:31.250
an acoustic
reflection

02:31.252 --> 02:33.552
from the stairs to my desk.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.220
Really?

02:35.222 --> 02:36.688
Mm-hmm,

02:36.690 --> 02:38.524
just like Nancy
at the far east desk

02:38.526 --> 02:40.192
can hear everything I say.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.827
Nancy, can you hear me?

02:43.364 --> 02:44.730
Hey, Nancy.

02:44.732 --> 02:48.300
Wow. I've been here
15 years, I...

02:48.302 --> 02:49.835
That's how he does it.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.270
McGee: How who does what?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.604
Gibbs.
That's how he knows

02:52.606 --> 02:54.206
everything
we're saying.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.441
There must be
a sweet spot in this room.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.777
A little acoustic...
(Pops)

02:58.779 --> 03:01.580
...where he can hear
every single thing we say.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.315
I bet you he
comes in here early

03:03.317 --> 03:05.284
and he waits,
bides his time,

03:05.286 --> 03:06.285
like a howler monkey
in heat

03:06.287 --> 03:07.319
waiting for exactly

03:07.321 --> 03:08.587
the right moment to...

03:08.589 --> 03:11.223
Step in and finish
your sentence?

03:11.225 --> 03:12.457
Exactly.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.259
Thank you, boss.

03:14.261 --> 03:15.827
Howler monkey?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.230
Well, yeah. You know,
primates are fascinating.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.265
I've been watching
a lot of discovery channel.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.267
Did you know that...
That there's a dead marine
in an alley?

03:22.269 --> 03:24.336
Yeah, I did.
And now you do, too.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.771
If you're done lurking...

03:25.773 --> 03:28.373
Gear up; Let's go.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.843
(Siren whoops in distance)

03:31.845 --> 03:34.713
Marine private John angel.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.549
Stationed down the street at
joint base myer-Henderson hall.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.786
Anything missing?
Uh, looks like he's got all his
credit cards and cash.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.721
So we're not
looking at a mugging.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.356
Could've been a fight
that got out of hand--

03:44.358 --> 03:45.691
his collar and
shirt are ripped.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.893
Well, I'm seeing some,
uh, several abrasions

03:47.895 --> 03:50.362
on the knuckles here,
as well as some

03:50.364 --> 03:52.364
blunt force trauma up here.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.267
Looks like somebody took a
couple uppercuts to the jaw.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.318
We'll be able
to find out how many

03:56.319 --> 03:57.368
once we get him back
for some x-rays.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.837
Where's ducky?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.907
That's a... well, that's a,
that's a interesting question.

04:01.909 --> 04:02.841
What's the answer?

04:04.311 --> 04:05.377
Um...

04:05.379 --> 04:07.646
What was the question?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.448
You're perfectly aware
that Gibbs is capable

04:09.450 --> 04:10.949
of eating you, right?

04:10.951 --> 04:13.619
It's a recurring nightmare, yes.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.420
Look, the truth is

04:15.422 --> 04:17.823
I don't know where
Dr. Mallard is. I'm sorry.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.458
I saw him in autopsy
this morning.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.293
Jimmy: Yeah, so did I,
but then he left.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.262
He told me he was going out
to get some dry cleaning,

04:23.264 --> 04:25.330
but I got the funny feeling
he wasn't being honest.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.766
Did you try his cell?
11 times.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.468
He never picked up.
I mean, finally,

04:29.470 --> 04:31.436
I just had to take the Van
and go.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.472
Call his cell again.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.007
Traffic was killer today.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.541
("Scotland the brave"
playing in distance)
Cell battery could've died.

04:36.543 --> 04:37.960
Shh.

04:37.961 --> 04:39.378
Maybe he just wants
to be left alone.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.380
("Scotland the brave" continues)
Shh, shh, shh.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.349
("Scotland the brave"
continuing)

04:58.032 --> 05:01.500
(Muffled grunting)

05:10.311 --> 05:13.545
I received a call from a man
claiming to be a lawyer.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.948
He said he had information
about a member of my family.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.884
I suggested that we meet
at the coffee shop

05:18.886 --> 05:20.385
round the front there.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.887
What kind of information?

05:21.889 --> 05:24.056
Well, actually,
he didn't have any.

05:24.058 --> 05:26.858
And when it became
quickly apparent

05:26.860 --> 05:30.729
that he was fishing
for information from me, I left.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.364
And he followed you.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.367
Yes, he tried to force me
into that Van.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.337
I struggled and I was
knocked unconscious.

05:38.339 --> 05:41.606
When I awoke, I was exactly
as you found me...

05:42.576 --> 05:44.376
...trussed up
like a chicken.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.847
This the guy?

05:48.849 --> 05:51.483
No.
Though I remember

05:51.485 --> 05:53.118
seeing that face
in the coffee shop.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.087
I've no idea how
he ended up out here.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.489
Checking for witnesses.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.830
Who's the relative?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.466
Ducky.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.967
Who was the guy asking about?

06:08.969 --> 06:11.603
He was asking about...

06:11.605 --> 06:13.805
Nicholas Mallard.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.474
My brother.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.078
Duck?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.747
When my parents divorced,

06:21.749 --> 06:23.682
my father remarried.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.985
She was a ghastly,
terrible woman.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.687
But they had a son,

06:28.689 --> 06:31.890
20 years my junior.
His name

06:31.892 --> 06:33.859
was Nicholas.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.794
¶ It's christmastime again... ¶

06:35.796 --> 06:37.596
Donnie!
(Chuckles)

06:37.598 --> 06:39.831
I thought you weren't
coming back until next week.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.833
Change of plans,
little brother.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.403
Looks like I'll just have to
spend the holidays with you.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.470
Happy Christmas, Nicholas.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.805
Whoa!

06:46.807 --> 06:49.007
Wait, I got a present
for you, too.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.880
Oh, good.
Lorraine.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.181
You can watch Nicholas.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.083
Hello to you, too.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.451
Wait, where are you going?

06:59.453 --> 07:01.887
Out.
Out?

07:01.889 --> 07:04.456
He's eight years old-- you're
just gonna leave him on his own?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.858
He'll be fine.
He always is.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.460
It's Christmas Eve, Lorraine.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.128
It's bad enough
father has to work.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.730
Well, I have plans, too.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.098
Now out my way.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.701
¶ ...on the tree, 'cause
everybody's gotta see... ¶

07:16.703 --> 07:17.769
(door closes)

07:19.807 --> 07:20.939
Oh!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.874
¶ Oh, it's christmastime
again... ¶

07:22.876 --> 07:24.543
now, listen, your mother...

07:24.545 --> 07:25.610
I know.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.747
Thought she'd never leave.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.515
You cheeky little monkey.

07:30.517 --> 07:31.650
What'd you get me?

07:31.652 --> 07:34.052
Well, open it.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.489
(Chuckles):
Yes.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.957
Now, that

07:38.959 --> 07:42.594
is a replica of
a 4468 Mallard train.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.829
Holder of the world
speed record

07:43.831 --> 07:46.131
for steam locomotives
and named

07:46.133 --> 07:47.999
after our great-grandfather,

07:48.001 --> 07:49.768
Bernard Mallard.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.603
Nice try.
You already said

07:51.605 --> 07:53.605
they named the duck after him.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.173
He got around?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.708
Who's the cheeky monkey now?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.577
(Growls)

07:58.579 --> 08:00.145
Beep-beep!
(Phone rings)

08:00.147 --> 08:02.247
¶ ...the lights
are on the tree ¶

08:02.249 --> 08:04.249
¶ 'cause everybody's
gotta see... ¶

08:04.251 --> 08:06.485
Mallard residence.
This is Dr. Mallard.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.553
(Man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

08:08.555 --> 08:10.522
Well, isn't there
anyone else available?

08:10.524 --> 08:11.557
I'm sorry,
i can't just...

08:11.558 --> 08:12.591
(Man speaking
indistinctly over phone)

08:12.593 --> 08:14.593
Yes, sir.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.927
I understand, sir.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.996
I'll be right there, sir.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.732
Who was it?

08:20.734 --> 08:22.267
The military hospital.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.735
I've been ordered
there immediately,

08:23.737 --> 08:25.070
goodness knows why.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.705
I understand.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.273
I'll be fine.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.209
Well, I suppose that depends
on how you feel

08:31.211 --> 08:32.878
about the sight of blood.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.914
Grab your coat.
Yes!

08:35.916 --> 08:37.983
Come on!

08:39.553 --> 08:42.020
(Chuckles)
He was such a wonderful boy.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.522
So full of life,

08:43.524 --> 08:46.558
despite abysmal
parenting. Oh,

08:46.560 --> 08:47.893
my father did his best.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.728
But his mother,
on the other hand...

08:49.730 --> 08:52.597
(Short chuckle)
Well, not winning awards

08:52.599 --> 08:54.866
for mother of the year.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.169
Duck, is there a reason you
never told me you had a brother?

08:58.171 --> 09:00.105
Well, we lost contact

09:00.107 --> 09:02.674
under unfortunate circumstances.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.142
And he passed away.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.011
It-it was years...

09:06.013 --> 09:08.146
Years before
you and I met.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.814
To be honest, Jethro,
it's a subject

09:09.816 --> 09:13.051
on which I prefer
not to dwell.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.787
Any idea why someone
was asking about him now?

09:15.789 --> 09:17.022
None whatsoever.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.325
Well, perhaps
Nicholas

09:20.327 --> 09:24.262
was involved in some nefarious
activity before his death.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.332
If he was, I can't even
imagine what it might've been.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.601
Nor would I want to.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.573
This is marine private
John angel.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.907
Worked for the headquarters
and service battalion

09:35.909 --> 09:37.175
at Henderson hall.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.643
Eyewitnesses
at the coffee house

09:38.645 --> 09:40.045
say that
he ran into the alley

09:40.047 --> 09:41.613
when they heard
ducky calling for help.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.881
Angel probably saved his life.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.583
You trace the call to ducky yet?

09:44.585 --> 09:46.585
Dead end.
Came from a prepaid burn phone.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.852
What about the Van?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.154
Uh, we actually
got lucky there.

09:49.156 --> 09:52.357
Van is registered with...

09:52.359 --> 09:54.726
Pimpyourwheels.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.361
Pimpyourwheels?
Yup. It's, um,

09:56.363 --> 09:57.896
well, it's
like an uber

09:57.898 --> 09:59.264
meets, uh, spinlister.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.599
I would have
said lyft

10:00.601 --> 10:02.067
meets zagster, but...

10:02.069 --> 10:03.234
Are you guys talking English?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.036
Sorry, boss.
It's, uh,

10:05.038 --> 10:07.606
it's a ridesharing application
that allows private car owners

10:07.608 --> 10:10.141
to rent out their cars
to total strangers.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.111
You can do it
from your phone.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.814
It's a
brave new world.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.184
The Van is owned
by this guy, Sam Butler.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.920
Ducky says it's not the guy who
attacked him, which makes sense.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.622
McGee:
Calendar on his web site
shows that the Van

10:23.624 --> 10:24.689
was rented out
the entire week.

10:24.691 --> 10:25.690
Did it say to who?

10:25.692 --> 10:28.093
No.
Go talk to him.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.363
Might want to take one of these.

10:31.365 --> 10:32.897
Worked up a sketch
with ducky's input.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.667
Ducky:
It's an excellent likeness.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.068
Put out a bolo.
On it.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.136
Jake called.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.674
You?

10:44.745 --> 10:45.977
What'd he want?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.412
Wanted to make sure
you were here.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.713
Said he was coming over.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.185
Thought you'd want to know.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.956
Ducky: I gather you two
haven't really spoken

10:57.958 --> 10:59.691
since you came back.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.893
Though I imagine

11:01.895 --> 11:04.696
that you have
quite a lot to say.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.666
My big brother used to tell me

11:07.668 --> 11:10.168
when life throws you
a curveball,

11:10.170 --> 11:12.837
you can either duck,

11:12.839 --> 11:14.906
get hit,

11:14.908 --> 11:17.308
or swing.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.744
I've decided to swing.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.446
Your brother's a smart man.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.381
He is.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.216
I'm sure yours
thought the same about you.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.356
Excuse me. I'm looking for
field marshal rand.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.457
Lieutenant Mallard.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.392
I was ordered
to report to the E.R.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.860
Sorry they bothered you.
He wouldn't let

11:35.862 --> 11:37.262
anyone else touch him.
Why me?

11:37.264 --> 11:39.164
I'm not his doctor.
I don't even know him.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.299
Well, he was keen as
mustard about you.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.834
Delirious
when he came in,

11:42.835 --> 11:44.368
but kept shouting for us
to "find that Mallard

11:44.371 --> 11:46.705
I keep hearing about
from my field commanders!"

11:46.707 --> 11:48.773
Till he finally
passed out.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.809
You're famous.
Apparently.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.312
What's wrong with him?
Nobody knows.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.781
Personally, I think it's
too much of the Christmas port.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.850
Or maybe just a bit
too much Christmas.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.118
I'm not a fan myself.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.253
Maybe you should
switch religions.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.124
Prep him for surgery
immediately.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.959
What?
He's suffering from an acute

12:07.961 --> 12:10.095
mesenteric ischemia.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.997
Well, give it some stick.
We might still save his life.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.899
All right, come on.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.469
(Christmas instrumental
music playing over P.A.)

12:17.471 --> 12:19.771
Well, that threw a spanner
in the works.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.306
You gonna be all right
here for a bit?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.041
Got some chocolate
and your stamp book.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.776
Can we do rounds
when you're done?

12:24.778 --> 12:26.978
Pope wear a funny hat?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.379
Then I'll be fine.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.948
Now give it some stick,

12:29.950 --> 12:31.950
you might still
save his life.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.151
(Growls)

12:33.153 --> 12:35.186
Beep, beep!
Nurse: They're prepping the O.R.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.188
Good. I want to start
with an angiogram,

12:37.190 --> 12:39.157
then get him ready
for ng tube decompression.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.825
I'll need a heparin drip...
Donald.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.460
Dad, great.

12:42.461 --> 12:44.094
You got my note.
Um, Nicholas is right here.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.331
You all right?
Lorraine--

12:46.333 --> 12:49.434
she come by my work.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.337
She served me
with divorce papers.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.405
She said she's
leaving the country.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.974
Oh, is that all?

12:55.975 --> 12:57.542
Good riddance to the scrubber.
She hates us both.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.944
And she's taking Nicholas
with her.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.381
She's taking our boy.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.396
(Dogs barking in distance)

13:19.065 --> 13:21.266
Can't believe ducky
has a brother.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.234
I would've loved to have had
ducky as a big brother.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.337
From what I can tell, he was
more of a father to the kid.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.040
Seemed to me like he practically
raised Nicholas himself.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.176
Would've loved to have
had ducky as a father.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.477
(Wry chuckle)
Me, too.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.546
Man:
May I help you?

13:34.548 --> 13:37.248
Well, if you're
the unabomber, no,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.417
but if you're Sam
Butler...You betcha.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.985
Yeah, I'm Sam.
What's up?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.120
Well, we are

13:42.122 --> 13:44.289
special agents McGee
and DiNozzo, NCIS.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.591
A Van registered to you was
recently used in a crime.

13:46.593 --> 13:47.926
Oh, wow.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.828
That's pretty cool.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.963
I mean, not really, but...

13:51.965 --> 13:53.231
Kind of.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.499
(Sniffs)

13:54.501 --> 13:56.167
Oh, it wasn't me, by the way.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.502
The Van was rented out.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.103
Tony:
Yeah, we heard.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.339
We would like
to know to who.

14:01.341 --> 14:05.009
Uh, this week was a guy
named Rufus Simms.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.178
I got a copy
of his driver's license.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.447
This him?
No.

14:09.449 --> 14:13.218
But I did see a guy with Rufus
that looked just like that

14:13.220 --> 14:15.153
last night.
I tried to rent him my bicycle,

14:15.155 --> 14:17.121
actually, but he wasn't
interested.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.357
You rent your
bicycle, too?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.960
Yeah. Bicycle, car,
even the house.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.394
That's what the tent's for.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.330
(Chuckles)
The ladies must love that.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.965
Woman:
Hi.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.467
(Dogs barking,
howling in distance)

14:29.469 --> 14:31.970
Two weeks a month
covers my mortgage.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.571
Who needs to work?
(Chuckles)

14:33.573 --> 14:34.956
Uh, us, actually.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.340
Uh, we need to
talk to Rufus Simms.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.142
You know where
we might find him?

14:38.144 --> 14:39.510
Did you try the house?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.145
Rufus rented
your house, too?

14:41.147 --> 14:43.414
Yeah, he got the whole
package deal.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.650
You're more than welcome to
give a knock, if you want to.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.118
(Woman screaming)

14:48.154 --> 14:50.655
What's wrong?
That...

14:50.657 --> 14:52.390
Is very wrong.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.559
Sam: Yeah, that's...
That's him. That's...

14:54.561 --> 14:57.095
That's Rufus.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.631
Did you rent him
the rope, too?

14:59.633 --> 15:03.167
Ducky:
The romans and greeks
were sanguine about suicide.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.637
But it's a good job
he's not an orphic.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.505
They believed the human
body belonged to the gods.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.274
(Elevator bell chimes)

15:09.275 --> 15:11.042
Thus, killing oneself was
an offense against them.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.310
(Elevator bell chimes)

15:12.312 --> 15:13.678
You confirming
it was a suicide?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.580
No, I can confirm

15:15.582 --> 15:16.948
that it was not.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.017
No, we found chlorinated water
in his lungs.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.286
Abby matched it to the
swimming pool in the backyard.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.420
Ducky:
He drowned, roughly

15:22.422 --> 15:24.155
12 hours ago.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.358
And then someone staged his body
to look like a suicide.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.662
I presume that the man who tried
to kidnap me is a suspect?

15:30.664 --> 15:31.629
Yeah.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.298
Which means

15:33.300 --> 15:35.500
that I could easily have
suffered the same fate.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.602
You are lucky
to be alive, doctor.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.670
This guy look familiar, duck?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.305
You ever seen him before?

15:41.174 --> 15:44.275
No, and I read your report.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.644
No record, no family,
visiting from Philadelphia.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.713
Well, I haven't
been there in years,

15:48.715 --> 15:51.516
much less to the post office
where he worked.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.051
Rufus was a mailman?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.520
Actually, he was a
department manager.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.654
I'm sorry
i can't be more helpful,

15:56.656 --> 15:59.524
but I haven't
a clue as to why

15:59.526 --> 16:01.459
my attacker killed this man,

16:01.461 --> 16:05.630
nor why he was asking
about Nicholas.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.231
I might have an idea.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.033
McGee found something
hidden in the lining

16:09.035 --> 16:10.368
of Rufus's suitcase.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.703
It's an old letter to ducky

16:11.705 --> 16:13.104
from his brother.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.139
This could be
Nicholas's handwriting.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.308
But I've never seen
this letter before.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.411
Oh, it's addressed
to my old flat in London!

16:20.413 --> 16:23.181
I haven't been
there in 40 years.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.085
What's it say?
It says, uh...

16:27.087 --> 16:28.619
"I miss you
very much."

16:28.621 --> 16:32.590
He wants to know where I am and
when he's gonna see me again.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.192
(Laughs)

16:34.194 --> 16:38.162
Apparently,
i owed him a hot chocolate.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.769
Mother said
we're moving away.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.571
That I'd never
see you again.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.473
Oh, that's not
gonna happen.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.174
First, you owe
me ten quid.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.610
Second, you're
my brother.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.579
Nothing's gonna
keep us apart.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.715
But what if she takes me,
and you can't find us?

16:57.717 --> 16:58.783
Not likely.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.585
I would look
under every rock,

17:00.587 --> 17:02.620
turn every town and
city upside down.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.357
Ransack every third world flea
pit until I found you again.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.426
That's a little dramatic.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.161
We're only half-brothers,

17:10.163 --> 17:12.030
remember?

17:12.032 --> 17:13.698
Speaking of third world
flea pits,

17:13.700 --> 17:15.767
I forgot to give you
these for your book.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.302
The Congo!
Might be my last
for a while.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.104
I've had my fill
of traveling,

17:20.106 --> 17:22.707
which is another reason
you better not go missing.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.710
Now, that hot
chocolate looks cold.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.745
Think I owe you
another one.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.681
(Crowd chatter, horn beeping,
bell tolling)

17:35.121 --> 17:36.254
Thanks, mate.
Keep the change.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.456
Cheers, guv'nor.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.526
(Horns honking)

17:41.528 --> 17:43.194
In you go, Nick.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.762
(Lively rock music playing)

17:47.700 --> 17:49.667
Pinball!

17:52.739 --> 17:55.339
Remember that ten quid
i owe you?

17:55.341 --> 17:58.776
How about we make it 11?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.745
Go on then.
Yes!

18:05.852 --> 18:08.119
Dr. Donald Mallard.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.188
Barrister Angus Clarke.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.690
Well, seeing
as you're well aware

18:12.692 --> 18:15.393
that I take my mushy peas
on Thursdays after court,

18:15.395 --> 18:17.495
I take it
this is not a coincidence.

18:17.497 --> 18:21.833
I know we didn't leave things
on the best of terms.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.634
You knocked out
my two front teeth.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.304
I need your help, Angus.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.709
(Pinball bells dinging)

18:31.711 --> 18:33.811
She filed
for full custody already.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.114
Which I see
she's offered to waive.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.416
If my father pays
her 10,000 pounds.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.251
Apparently, motherhood's
not the strongest bond.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.719
It's moot.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.223
Father's a doorman. He doesn't
have that sort of money.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.158
Angus, if she gets custody,

18:47.160 --> 18:48.893
can she really leave the
country with Nicholas?

18:48.895 --> 18:52.230
If your father requests it,
there'd be a relocation hearing,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.565
which he'd lose.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.267
Look, Donnie,

18:56.269 --> 18:58.536
I'll help you fight this,
of course I will,

18:58.538 --> 19:00.271
but that's the least
of your problems.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.740
I like Joseph, but you've always
been much more of a father

19:02.742 --> 19:04.475
to that boy than he ever has.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.677
Even if we win this,
he'll never be able

19:06.679 --> 19:07.912
to raise Nicholas himself.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.648
I know, which is
why I'm gonna do it.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.417
And be a doctor
in the royal army medical corps?

19:13.419 --> 19:14.652
I'm resigning my commission.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.721
Resign? Are you
off your trolley?

19:16.723 --> 19:18.322
You've wanted this
your entire life.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.924
Nicholas<i> is</i> my life.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.926
This, quite simply,
is not a decision

19:21.928 --> 19:24.562
that requires one
second of thought.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.197
¶ It's a winter's day now ¶

19:26.199 --> 19:28.166
¶<i> it's a winter's...</i> ¶

19:29.669 --> 19:31.736
you sure you've never
seen this letter before?

19:31.738 --> 19:34.839
Absolutely, and i
can't even speculate

19:34.841 --> 19:36.908
how our victim got it.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.943
Your attacker was asking you
about your brother?

19:38.945 --> 19:40.912
It must have something
to do with this letter.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.864
Abby wants to analyze it,

19:42.865 --> 19:44.815
see if she can figure out
the connection.

19:47.754 --> 19:48.753
(Elevator bell chimes)

19:48.755 --> 19:51.856
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.592
Hi, Ellie.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.195
You got a sec?

20:09.442 --> 20:13.244
Should I be preparing
for another crime scene?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.951
(Elevator bell chimes)

20:19.953 --> 20:21.385
Hey, I'm sorry
to ambush you

20:21.387 --> 20:22.820
at work like this,
but we need to talk.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.422
Bishop:
It's okay.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.857
You're right. We do.

20:26.859 --> 20:30.294
I have had a lot of time
to think, and...

20:30.296 --> 20:31.796
Actually, can-can I go first?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.832
There's something i
really need to say.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.935
Yeah, I got that sense

20:37.937 --> 20:41.639
from the 6,000 messages
you left on my voicemail.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.874
Yeah, I know. I already
apologized about 1,000 times

20:43.876 --> 20:46.544
about the affair, but I would
gladly do it a thousand more

20:46.546 --> 20:48.312
if I thought it would
make any difference.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.281
Okay.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.450
Go.
I'm sorry.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.885
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sor...
You're right. No.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.288
It's not helping.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.956
I'm sorry.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.792
My point is that, um...

21:03.029 --> 21:04.695
...the affair with Taylor
isn't the problem...

21:04.697 --> 21:06.731
Trust me, Jake...

21:06.733 --> 21:07.932
It's a problem.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.969
Yeah, no, okay,
fair enough, but...

21:11.971 --> 21:13.938
What I mean is that...

21:15.308 --> 21:18.342
...it is also a symptom
of something deeper.

21:18.344 --> 21:21.979
When we were at
the NSA together,

21:21.981 --> 21:24.682
we were together.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.851
Happily in the bubble.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.453
Two peas in a pod.
Right.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.555
And then when you left,

21:31.557 --> 21:33.524
suddenly there was...
There was a wall.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.893
And we could... we could
barely talk to each other.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.496
Well, yeah, not without
violating national security.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.697
And that is the problem.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.967
I put national
security first.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.935
I put the NSA before my wife.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.705
I will do
whatever it takes

21:47.707 --> 21:50.574
to repair our marriage.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.713
What if I'm not?

21:55.715 --> 21:58.449
What? Ellie, come on.
You're right.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.620
Your affair isn't the problem.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.922
We...

22:04.924 --> 22:06.757
We weren't working.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.994
No. Eleanor...
Why did you
tell me about the affair?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.062
What?

22:11.064 --> 22:12.897
I would never have found out.

22:12.899 --> 22:16.000
I think you wanted me to know.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.469
It's over, Jake.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.571
It's been over for a long time.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.506
We are just saying it
out loud now.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.884
Mmm.
Ow!

22:33.886 --> 22:35.453
Mm.
Ow!

22:35.455 --> 22:36.921
Ow! Ow!

22:36.923 --> 22:38.055
Mm.
Ow!

22:38.057 --> 22:39.557
Mm.
Ow!

22:39.559 --> 22:41.125
Hey, Gibbs.
I'm just working out

22:41.127 --> 22:43.627
my aggressions
here on Jake.
Tony said you had something.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.664
I'll be back. Yes.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.600
Rufus Simms' watch.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.470
Tony found it in the pool
where Rufus was murdered.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.138
It's a smart watch.
It has GPS...

22:54.140 --> 22:56.741
That means you can tell me
where Rufus has been?

22:56.743 --> 22:59.977
Yes, except the water destroyed
all the data on the flash drive,

22:59.979 --> 23:03.080
so, no, but yes, because

23:03.082 --> 23:05.049
I am... awesome.

23:05.051 --> 23:08.853
The onboard motion sensors
inside the watch--

23:08.855 --> 23:11.055
they had their own
memory storage,

23:11.057 --> 23:12.923
and that remained intact.

23:12.925 --> 23:17.595
Using that data, I was
able to build a 3-d map

23:17.597 --> 23:20.898
of Rufus's wrist movements
throughout the day.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.100
Like, if he was
buttering his toast,

23:23.102 --> 23:25.002
or tying his shoe, or,

23:25.004 --> 23:29.173
say, typing on a keyboard.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.041
A few algorithms later,
and I was able

23:31.043 --> 23:34.712
to extrapolate what he was
typing just before he died.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.547
Typing what?
A Google search

23:36.549 --> 23:39.517
for a pawn shop-- last
Google search he ever did.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.618
And I have an address.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.119
(Computer chirps)

23:42.121 --> 23:44.688
You're right.
You are awesome.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.190
(Computer chirps)
But wait!

23:46.192 --> 23:48.025
There's more!

23:48.027 --> 23:51.128
I've also been analyzing the
letter from ducky's brother,

23:51.130 --> 23:52.997
trying to figure out where

23:52.999 --> 23:55.699
it's been, and
major mass spec just dinged,

23:55.701 --> 23:58.769
so we shall travel through
these results together.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.104
(Computer chirping)

24:00.106 --> 24:02.173
The paper seems
surprisingly clean

24:02.175 --> 24:04.141
for how old
it would be.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.110
But we'll learn more
from the ink analysis.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.145
Ink is like
a, um... like

24:08.147 --> 24:12.483
a dirt roach motel, and through
dirt, you can really...

24:12.485 --> 24:14.051
(Rapid beeping)
Find out...

24:14.053 --> 24:15.653
Wait.

24:16.722 --> 24:17.788
That can't be.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.973
What?

24:18.974 --> 24:20.157
Well, the solvent
evaporation levels

24:20.159 --> 24:21.659
are way too low.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.694
Way too low for what?

24:23.696 --> 24:27.531
Well, ink solvent evaporates
at a known rate.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.667
And then, by measuring
those levels, you can

24:29.669 --> 24:30.901
tell how long ago

24:30.903 --> 24:32.236
a letter was written.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.537
Well, how long ago?

24:33.539 --> 24:35.139
According to these numbers,

24:35.141 --> 24:37.808
this letter was written
three weeks ago.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.145
I mean, Gibbs, if ducky's
brother did write that letter,

24:41.147 --> 24:43.147
then that means that...

24:43.149 --> 24:44.248
Ducky's brother is still alive.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.517
Yeah.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.026
This is not possible.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.829
The stationery looks
half a century old.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.898
We reran the tests
three times.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.268
The paper may be old,
but what's written on it isn't.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.570
Then it has to be a forgery.

25:06.572 --> 25:09.039
My brother died decades ago.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.008
Abby pulled
touch DNA from it.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.977
She got a familial
match to you.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.913
Duck, this letter was written by
your brother three weeks ago.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.519
Hey, you all right?
No!

25:21.521 --> 25:23.721
I spent the last half
of my life

25:23.723 --> 25:26.524
believing
that my brother was dead.

25:26.526 --> 25:30.160
And all that-that time, he's
been out there somewhere.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.795
This is wrong.
It's all wrong.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.063
Nicholas has to know

25:33.065 --> 25:35.165
that I don't live
at that address anymore.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.001
May be the only address he had.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.003
And the handwriting--
it's that of a child.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.705
Nicholas has got to be
in his 50's by now.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.607
We think it might be
some kind of code,

25:43.609 --> 25:44.642
that he may be in trouble.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.677
Well, we know he's in trouble!

25:46.679 --> 25:49.547
The man who attacked me,

25:49.549 --> 25:51.549
who was asking about Nicholas--

25:51.551 --> 25:53.817
we can assume he's still
looking for Nicholas,

25:53.819 --> 25:55.819
which means
Nicholas is in danger.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.655
We'll get to him first.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.123
Well, do you have any leads?

25:59.125 --> 26:01.125
McGee: Abby thinks that
the victim visited

26:01.127 --> 26:02.877
a pawn shop the
day he was killed,

26:02.878 --> 26:04.628
so we think we might be
able to find something there.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.797
Then what the blazes
are you doing here?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.999
Duck...

26:09.001 --> 26:11.068
We'll find him.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.974
What about the lifetime
we lost together?

26:16.976 --> 26:18.108
(Door bell jingles)

26:19.712 --> 26:20.744
This is...

26:20.746 --> 26:21.812
Man:
What do they have?

26:21.814 --> 26:23.314
One of the first
books ever printed?

26:23.316 --> 26:26.300
A samurai sword?

26:26.301 --> 26:29.285
I'm Dwayne Parker,
and this is...<i> Pawnalicious!</i>

26:29.288 --> 26:31.956
How can I help you boys?

26:33.593 --> 26:37.127
Well, you can start
by turning that thing off.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.997
Uh, sorry, we're, uh...
We're filming a show.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.866
We have almost 500 hits
on YouTube.

26:42.868 --> 26:43.867
Gonna go viral.

26:43.869 --> 26:46.837
Okeydokey then.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.239
Uh...

26:49.241 --> 26:51.241
This guy ever come in here?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.210
Man:
Yeah, uh, Rufus something.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.078
Came in yesterday.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.079
What'd he want?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.747
Wanted to pawn a rare stamp.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.649
From the Camelot collection,

26:58.651 --> 27:00.117
printed by the
British royal mail

27:00.119 --> 27:02.620
in 1973 and sold as a pair.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.755
The king Arthur and the Merlin.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.923
He had the king Arthur.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.758
And did you take it
off his hands?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.026
Got it for two grand.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.629
The guy wanted ten,
but the stamp was damaged.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.632
Some idiot tried
to mail a letter with it.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.067
I told him too bad
he didn't have the Merlin.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.770
Undamaged, this stamp
is worth, now,

27:19.772 --> 27:21.772
north of a half-million dollars.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.707
That's when he and his buddy
started fighting.

27:23.709 --> 27:24.775
His buddy?

27:24.777 --> 27:26.176
Yeah, the guy got really pissed

27:26.178 --> 27:28.412
when he found out
how much the Merlin was worth.

27:28.414 --> 27:31.215
I think that, uh, Rufus guy
lied to him about it.

27:31.217 --> 27:32.683
It's gonna make
a great episode.

27:32.685 --> 27:33.651
Hmm. Is this the buddy?

27:33.653 --> 27:34.818
Yeah.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.422
The detectives appear
to be interested

27:38.424 --> 27:40.691
in the buddy for some reason.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.226
Tony:
We got a still of Rufus's buddy

27:42.228 --> 27:44.828
from the<i> pawnalicious</i>
raw footage. Ducky confirmed

27:44.830 --> 27:46.063
it's the guy
who attacked him.

27:46.064 --> 27:47.297
We were able to
use the footage

27:47.299 --> 27:49.133
to come up with a
facial-recognition match.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.868
Tony:
Meet Viggo trellis,

27:50.870 --> 27:52.936
a p.I. From Philly.

27:52.938 --> 27:55.005
P.I. From Philly.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.373
Bishop: Viggo trellis,

27:56.375 --> 27:58.442
private investigator.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.245
And guess who recently
hired him.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.280
Second victim, Rufus Simms.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.319
Rufus Simms.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.854
Sorry.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.424
Rufus Simms hired Viggo.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.895
Do you need to go home?

28:19.098 --> 28:22.032
Yeah.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.437
(Sighs)

28:30.076 --> 28:33.177
Actually, no,
i don't need to go home.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.778
Where were we?

28:34.780 --> 28:36.146
Rufus Simms.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.782
Right, and we have a theory
on why Viggo killed him.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.452
We know ducky's brother
used the king Arthur, uh,

28:41.454 --> 28:43.087
collector's stamp
to mail his letter.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.988
But...
But without a valid
stamp, it ended up at

28:44.990 --> 28:47.725
the dead-letter office,
which Rufus Simms managed.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.259
Rufus...
Rufus realized
this Nicholas guy

28:49.261 --> 28:51.862
had no idea how much
the stamp was worth and

28:51.864 --> 28:54.932
probably had the sister stamp,
too-- the Merlin.

28:54.934 --> 28:58.402
So Rufus hired a p.I.
To find this Nicholas,

28:58.404 --> 29:00.871
but when the p.I. Found out
how much the Merlin was worth,

29:00.873 --> 29:03.874
he killed Rufus and went looking
for ducky's brother himself.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.210
That is when he
contacted ducky.
I got it.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.277
You dumped Jake.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.212
Like a hot potato.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.880
Dumped him.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.115
I just spoke with Abby.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.449
Is it true?

29:12.451 --> 29:14.818
The letter from Nicholas
was postmarked Philadelphia?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.153
Yeah, the downtown
branch.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.822
Has he really been that
close all this time?

29:18.824 --> 29:20.057
If he is, we'll find him.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.892
Yes, but so
can the killer.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.061
You're just finding out
about that postmark.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.896
He's known for weeks.

29:25.898 --> 29:26.997
DiNozzo, McGee.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.932
MTAC, freeway cameras. On it.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.335
Bishop.
Viggo's cell number and bolo.
On it.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.470
Gibbs:
Duck, I need to know
everything you know

29:33.472 --> 29:35.405
about those stamps.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.911
Hello, sir. Thought I'd just pop
by to see how you're feeling.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.780
Angus:
See? It's like I said,

29:42.782 --> 29:44.782
embarrassingly
predictable.
What are you doing here?

29:44.784 --> 29:47.384
Well, I thought the field
marshal might need a barrister

29:47.386 --> 29:48.852
after you treated him.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.320
I need a drink, not a barrister.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.356
Then you'll also need
an undertaker, sir.

29:52.358 --> 29:55.159
Liver disease is what landed you
here in the first place.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.127
They say that I owe you my life.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.097
Until I'm done using it,
however,

30:00.099 --> 30:01.899
right here will have to do.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.867
Where did you find this?

30:03.869 --> 30:05.169
The nurses found it
outside my door.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.837
Said your boy forgot it.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.273
They told me
that I ruined his Christmas Eve,

30:09.275 --> 30:11.108
that he refused
to leave your side

30:11.110 --> 30:12.943
until you were done with me.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.945
Hmm.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.981
The only thing
i respect more than loyalty

30:17.983 --> 30:21.919
is a boy who appreciates
the fine art of philately.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.822
I had my aide fill it
with some favorites

30:24.824 --> 30:26.824
from my personal collection.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.992
Merry Christmas.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.361
Now sod off.
I have work to do.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.398
Thank you, sir.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.334
(Instrumental Christmas music
playing over P.A.)

30:40.039 --> 30:42.172
Lovely man.

30:43.576 --> 30:45.909
Okay, so what are you
doing here, really?

30:45.911 --> 30:48.245
Looking for you.
I've just come from
the magistrate's.

30:48.247 --> 30:51.081
Fantastic news
about the custody case.
Really?

30:51.083 --> 30:53.951
There is absolutely no way
either you or your father

30:53.953 --> 30:56.486
will ever get custody
of young Nicholas.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.556
Which is why

30:59.558 --> 31:01.458
I'm going to personally
give you the £10,000

31:01.460 --> 31:03.627
required to buy
that manky wench off.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.063
Angus...

31:06.065 --> 31:08.031
Angus, I can't possibly accept.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.299
And I quite simply
and unequivocally

31:09.301 --> 31:10.968
do not allow you to refuse.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.903
You...

31:12.905 --> 31:15.072
There are no words.
(Chuckles)

31:15.074 --> 31:16.640
Well, give it a try. I mean,

31:16.642 --> 31:19.243
I do so enjoy watching
you flounder.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.645
Dr. Mallard, there's an
emergency call for you.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.147
Line four.
Excuse me.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.884
Floundering will have to wait.
Emergency and all.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.619
It's a wonder your head
can fit through a door.

31:28.621 --> 31:30.220
(Chuckles)
Yes, this is Dr. mal...

31:30.222 --> 31:32.890
(Woman talking rapidly
and indistinctly over phone)

31:32.892 --> 31:34.324
Wait, miss Ellison, slow down.
What's wrong?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.626
Woman: (Speaks indistinctly)
...Taking Nicholas...

31:35.628 --> 31:37.060
What?!

31:37.062 --> 31:38.996
Try and delay them.
I'll be right there.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.497
What is it?
One of my father's neighbors.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.399
She said there are movers
at the apartment.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.936
My stepmother is trying to
sneak away with Nicholas!

31:45.938 --> 31:48.005
I'll call
the magistrate!

31:50.943 --> 31:53.010
I got Viggo's cell phone number.
Track it.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.945
Bishop:
It's an old model.

31:54.947 --> 31:55.913
Doesn't have GPS.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.581
Yes, but it has a microphone.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.016
Can you turn it on?

31:59.018 --> 32:01.018
Well, any first-year analyst
can do that.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.020
But we'll need a warrant.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.655
Well, they can sue me.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.061
All right, got it. On speaker.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.096
(Engine revving)

32:13.098 --> 32:14.498
Sounds like he's in a car.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.000
Trellis: Next light,
coming up. Turn there.

32:17.002 --> 32:19.469
That's definitely the man
that assaulted me.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.705
Man (British accent):
Where are you taking me?
He has someone with him.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.507
Trellis: Just keep your hands
on the wheel and keep driving,

32:23.509 --> 32:25.642
Nicholas,
and everything will be okay.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.177
Nicholas!

32:39.224 --> 32:41.024
All right, every agency
between here and the rio grande

32:41.026 --> 32:42.426
has Viggo's photo.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.961
We got a team canvassing
the freeways.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.696
Do we have a location yet?

32:45.698 --> 32:47.564
Uh, Abby and bishop
are triangulating

32:47.566 --> 32:49.366
off the cell towers-- so far,
they've got it narrowed down

32:49.368 --> 32:51.301
to a six-mile radius.
No, that's not good enough.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.437
Tell 'em to keep trying.
Ducky:
It sounds as if

32:53.439 --> 32:54.972
they just went over
train tracks.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.606
Checking train
crossings in the area.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.208
Do we know what
he's driving yet?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.543
McGee: Dmv doesn't have
anything registered,

32:59.545 --> 33:01.078
so it's either rented
or stolen.

33:02.081 --> 33:02.679
Wait.

33:02.681 --> 33:03.981
(Door opens)

33:03.983 --> 33:05.115
He's stopped.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.383
Trellis:
Get out.
Nicholas: Not until

33:06.385 --> 33:07.584
you tell me what's going on.

33:07.586 --> 33:08.719
(Gun cocks)
Okay.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.154
Put the gun down.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.689
We should call
the cell.
No.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.459
Try to negotiate.
No, there's too many
ways this can go wrong.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.160
What choice do we have?

33:17.162 --> 33:18.628
Tony:
Shh! Everyone quiet.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.431
(Chimes tinkling)
McGee, you hear that?

33:21.433 --> 33:23.300
McGee:
Yeah, chimes.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.569
The rental house. Viggo went
back to the scene of the crime.

33:25.571 --> 33:26.670
Let's move.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.343
No, ducky, absolutely not.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.611
You're staying here.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.580
Jethro...

33:36.581 --> 33:38.548
(Rental house door closing
over speakers, chimes tinkle)

33:40.119 --> 33:41.385
Ah, come on.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.756
(Tires screech)

33:54.166 --> 33:56.233
Boss, the seal's been broken
on that door.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.068
McGee:
Viggo must've figured he'd have

33:58.070 --> 34:00.037
some more privacy here.
McGee, take the back.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.039
DiNozzo, you're with me.
And you stay out here.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.408
This time,
no argument.
Go get my brother.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.222
(Wind whistling)

34:25.731 --> 34:28.365
Oh, thank god.
Donnie!

34:28.367 --> 34:31.234
Mother says we're leaving.
Right now.
You're not.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.702
Don't worry.
I don't want
to go.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.838
I don't want to leave you.
You're not
going anywhere.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.108
I got this.
And look what else I've got.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.444
You left it
at the hospital.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.379
Lorraine: Which is where
you're supposed to be.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.782
Let me guess:
Miss Ellison.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.184
(Scoffs)

34:47.186 --> 34:49.386
Woman never could
mind her own business.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.321
Come on. Let's go.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.789
I've got your money, Lorraine.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.724
You can stop playing games now.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.226
This isn't a game.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.694
And I don't want your money.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.229
My son isn't
for sale.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.397
He was yesterday.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.531
Well, I've changed my mind.

35:01.533 --> 35:02.866
I'm taking my boy

35:02.868 --> 35:05.735
and getting away from
the mallards for good.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.471
Nicholas:
Donnie!
Lorraine, please. Please.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.206
Let's just sit and discuss this,
Lorraine, please!

35:09.208 --> 35:11.008
Lorraine!

35:11.009 --> 35:12.809
Lorraine...
There's nothing to discuss.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.845
I'm not going!
Can't you see, Lorraine,

35:14.847 --> 35:16.847
he doesn't want to go.
I don't care what he wants.

35:16.849 --> 35:18.181
I'm his mother,
and we're going.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.117
Over my dead body.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.385
(Chuckles)

35:21.386 --> 35:22.652
I told the magistrate
you'd say that.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.588
Which is why he appointed them

35:24.590 --> 35:25.822
to help with the move.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.424
Get in the taxi, Nicholas.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.493
No! I said I'm not going!
Get in!

35:29.495 --> 35:31.828
Let him go!
Sir, need you
to stand back.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.564
Stand back.
Like bloody hell I will!

35:34.566 --> 35:36.900
Donnie! No! Don't hurt him!
Let go of me!

35:36.902 --> 35:37.801
Lorraine, please!

35:37.803 --> 35:39.803
Nicholas!

35:39.805 --> 35:41.404
(Gunshots)

35:41.406 --> 35:42.873
Ducky: Nicholas!

35:42.875 --> 35:43.907
(Gunfire stops)

35:43.909 --> 35:45.175
(Dog barking in distance)

35:47.246 --> 35:48.178
Nicholas!

35:48.180 --> 35:48.845
It's all clear, duck.

35:53.152 --> 35:53.884
Thank heavens
you're here.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.819
That guy was
barking mad.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.787
Is your name Nicholas Mallard?
Yes.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.923
What on earth
is going on?

36:07.866 --> 36:09.599
Let me go, damn you!
(Grunting)

36:09.601 --> 36:11.168
(Car engine starting)

36:11.170 --> 36:12.769
Donnie!
Nicholas!

36:12.771 --> 36:14.271
(Panting)

36:14.273 --> 36:16.673
(Grunting)

36:16.675 --> 36:18.275
No!

36:18.277 --> 36:19.910
Donnie!
No!

36:19.912 --> 36:22.445
No!

36:22.447 --> 36:26.917
I'm afraid, while Viggo got
the right Donald Mallard,

36:26.919 --> 36:28.852
he got the wrong Nicholas.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.256
This isn't my brother.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.496
Tony: All right,
why don't you come this way.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.797
Okay.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.575
I'll call mi...
Mr. Palmer and...

36:51.577 --> 36:53.977
Tell him to bring the Van.

36:56.949 --> 36:59.416
Take your time, duck.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.431
(Clock chiming
westminster quarters)

37:26.378 --> 37:28.778
She took the paintings
as well?

37:28.780 --> 37:30.380
(Door shuts)

37:30.382 --> 37:33.350
Even the ones
that weren't hers.
Angus: Well,

37:33.352 --> 37:35.952
Margaret always said she
was tears before bedtime.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.588
You haven't told her
about any of this?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.923
Or even that we've spoken?

37:39.925 --> 37:42.759
No. You asked me not
to and I haven't.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.028
Thanks. I can't...

37:45.030 --> 37:49.032
I'm just not ready
to see you two...
Yes.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.836
I gathered that when you
didn't come to the wedding.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.371
I understand, but...

37:54.373 --> 37:55.872
She misses you.

37:55.874 --> 37:59.276
For the life of me,
i can't figure out why.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.411
But she does.
(Chuckles)

38:01.413 --> 38:04.547
Have you heard
from your investigator friend?

38:04.549 --> 38:07.884
No. Not much.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.719
(Grunts)
He thinks Lorraine

38:09.721 --> 38:12.622
might have bought a
train ticket to Albania.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.993
Thinks maybe she took
Nicholas to be with family.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.929
Then I guess
I'm going to Albania.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.866
Aren't you in the,
you know, army?

38:22.868 --> 38:24.868
Yes. As it turns out,

38:24.870 --> 38:26.770
there's a field marshal
who owes me a favor.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.939
Mm.
He already said he'd be happy
to transfer me

38:29.941 --> 38:31.308
wherever I need to go.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.576
You will find him.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.645
Mm.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.013
I know you will.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.685
I will scour the entire planet.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.087
Look under every rock,

38:44.089 --> 38:46.856
turn every town and city
upside down.

38:46.858 --> 38:50.860
Ransack
every third world flea pit...

38:50.862 --> 38:53.930
Until I find my brother again.

38:59.871 --> 39:03.340
Jimmy: Wow. So all those
places you've been,

39:03.342 --> 39:05.408
all those years of travel,

39:05.410 --> 39:07.077
you were looking
for your brother.

39:07.079 --> 39:10.046
Eventually, I found a relative

39:10.048 --> 39:13.049
who informed me
that Nicholas and his mother

39:13.051 --> 39:16.586
were both killed
in a car crash in Prague.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.922
The very next day, I volunteered

39:18.924 --> 39:22.692
for an assignment
to an Afghan refugee camp.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.995
A broken man has no place
in polite society.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.932
Dr. Mallard,
that relative lied to you,

39:28.934 --> 39:31.368
probably just to throw
you off the track.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.769
Nicholas is alive.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.070
He wrote you that letter.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.275
Did he?

39:38.276 --> 39:39.609
No. Abby could have been
mistaken.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.077
It has happened.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.781
You know, Jimmy,

39:44.783 --> 39:49.119
when I heard that Nicholas
was dead, it almost killed me.

39:49.121 --> 39:52.389
I couldn't even bear
the thought of his name.

39:54.393 --> 39:58.161
And... it never improved.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.897
(Sighs)

40:00.899 --> 40:02.432
I...

40:02.434 --> 40:04.701
To my great sadness, don't know

40:04.703 --> 40:06.970
if I have the strength

40:06.972 --> 40:09.572
to start that journey again.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.442
Maybe we can help.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.744
Take a peek.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.045
Happy Christmas.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.882
This is a copy of a 1973

40:18.884 --> 40:20.417
plane ticket to Albania

40:20.419 --> 40:22.152
for a Nicholas and
Lorraine Mallard.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.726
This is an application
for a name change.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.661
Italy, 1974.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.764
Guess Ms. Mallard got tired
of her last name.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.674
Application for united
states residency,

40:44.676 --> 40:46.476
1987.

40:51.183 --> 40:53.183
You found him.

40:53.185 --> 40:55.218
Yeah.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.188
He's in a nursing home
just outside Philly.

40:58.190 --> 41:01.191
They say he's got early-onset
Alzheimer's but he's healthy.

41:01.193 --> 41:02.192
I'll take it.

41:02.194 --> 41:03.560
(Chuckles)

41:03.562 --> 41:05.662
Bishop:
Come on. Let's go.

41:05.664 --> 41:06.930
I could use a happy ending.

41:16.508 --> 41:19.175
Nicholas is one of
our favorite patients.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.611
So kind, so sweet.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.580
Usually he's no trouble at all,

41:23.582 --> 41:26.249
though we did have a scare
a couple of weeks ago.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.585
What happened?
Is he all right?

41:28.587 --> 41:30.220
Oh, yes.

41:30.222 --> 41:32.889
He got out and managed to
take a bus into the city.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.858
Luckily, we found him.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.126
At a post office,
of all places.

41:37.128 --> 41:40.563
We have no idea what
he was doing there.

41:41.666 --> 41:44.200
I do want to
warn you, though.

41:44.202 --> 41:48.204
Nicholas is happy, but he has no
recollection of his former life

41:48.206 --> 41:51.541
and hasn't for years.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.783
I think
you may have dropped this.

42:00.785 --> 42:04.187
I thought you might
be looking for it.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.526
Hello, Nicholas.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.308
Beep-beep!

42:25.310 --> 42:26.609
(Quiet laugh)

42:28.013 --> 42:29.579
You got my letter.

42:29.581 --> 42:32.649
You found me, Donnie.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.017
You found me.

42:34.019 --> 42:36.753
I did, that.

42:36.755 --> 42:38.821
I told you I would.

42:38.823 --> 42:41.224
And you broke one of the wheels
on my<i> Mallard.</i>

42:41.226 --> 42:42.292
I did.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.660
(Chuckles)

42:43.662 --> 42:45.595
You cheeky little monkey.

42:53.138 --> 42:54.571
(Contented sigh)

42:56.908 --> 42:58.107
(Sighs)
