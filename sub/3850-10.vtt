sketches for the... the nursery.

18:04.815 --> 18:07.884
Um, for a baby?

18:07.968 --> 18:09.536
No. No, for a monkey.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.522
Yes, honey, for a baby, of course.

18:12.573 --> 18:16.159
Um, honey, isn't it a little bit soon?

18:16.193 --> 18:18.595
Well, maybe, you know, but
I was always honest with you

18:18.662 --> 18:20.063
about how important
family was to me, right?

18:20.147 --> 18:21.231
No, yeah, it's important to me, too.

18:21.315 --> 18:23.566
I just... I didn't mean right... right now.

18:25.369 --> 18:27.604
Well, you know, I mean, I didn't mean to...

18:27.671 --> 18:28.571
Mean to rush you.

18:28.606 --> 18:30.440
No, it's okay.

18:30.507 --> 18:32.575

Yea... um, f...

18:42.987 --> 18:44.353

really want to talk about it

But he's a really big power player,

18:46.824 --> 18:48.007

18:49.443 --> 18:52.812
So is it cool if we just kind
of wait on the baby thing,

18:52.896 --> 18:54.430

18:54.498 --> 18:55.832
Yeah, it's cool.

18:55.933 --> 18:57.900
Yeah. It's cool.

- Very cool.

alternative. [Clears throat]

What's another 15 minutes, right?

19:20.974 --> 19:21.991

I have a lot of clients
who demand equal time.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.827
Obviously too many clients,

19:24.861 --> 19:26.462
because I spoke to a lawyer friend of mine

19:26.496 --> 19:29.198
who said if Joss' case was
being handled correctly,

19:29.266 --> 19:30.533
she'd be out of jail by now.

19:30.584 --> 19:33.069
Is there something specific
that I can help you with today?

19:33.136 --> 19:34.287
The fact that Joss didn't get bail

19:34.371 --> 19:36.939
and can't have any
visitors is unacceptable,

19:36.941 --> 19:38.908
especially when the police
have as little as they do.

19:41.078 --> 19:43.612
They know Joss was at the
mansion the night of the murder.

19:43.647 --> 19:46.649
They have video of her in Luca's bedroom

19:46.750 --> 19:48.050
trying to seduce him that night.

19:48.135 --> 19:50.719
They know Joss left the scene of the crime

19:50.821 --> 19:52.238
wearing Luca Raines' blood,

19:52.322 --> 19:54.723
that she drove home and showered,

19:54.825 --> 19:56.492
which would have removed any gun residue,

19:56.560 --> 19:58.260
before calling 911.

No, you can... you can stop.

include in-laws?

20:12.294 --> 20:13.472
You and Joss are related?

Technically I'm Joss'
brother-in-law, yeah.

20:16.396 --> 20:17.346
So you're married to her sister.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.647
I was, but we're divorced.

20:18.732 --> 20:20.516

20:20.600 --> 20:22.351
They don't have to know that, right?

Look, I've got a copy of my
marriage license right here,

20:25.021 --> 20:27.156
which proves that I'm
married to Joss' sister.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.408
What if I said I'm the
only link to the family

20:29.526 --> 20:31.944
because Joss' sister is
unreachable, which she is?

20:32.028 --> 20:33.362
Could I see her then?

20:33.446 --> 20:34.413
I'll see what I can do.
