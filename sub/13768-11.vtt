WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:04.254
There it is.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.673
Kill it.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.342
Dewey, a spider has

00:06.966 --> 00:08.342
just as much right

00:08.383 --> 00:10.218
to live as you or I.

00:10.260 --> 00:13.263
Besides, it's unlucky

00:10.260 --> 00:13.263
to kill it in the house.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.892
Okay.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.143
Hello, little fella.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.061
Come on, sweetheart.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.355
Oh!

00:21.396 --> 00:24.065
(screams)

00:24.107 --> 00:25.233
(screaming)

00:25.275 --> 00:27.068
(both screaming)

00:27.110 --> 00:29.070
Go! Go! Go!

00:29.112 --> 00:31.532
(screaming)

00:29.112 --> 00:31.532
Open the door! Open the door!

00:31.573 --> 00:33.074
Front or back or side?!

00:33.116 --> 00:35.953
Side. No, back.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.953
No, front! Front!

00:37.705 --> 00:39.498
(gasps)

00:39.540 --> 00:41.082
Oh, my God,

00:39.540 --> 00:41.082
did we just...?

00:41.124 --> 00:42.083
Go.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.335
She can only ground me.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.294
(Lois screaming)

00:44.336 --> 00:45.796
Get your keys and go.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.088
But...

00:45.838 --> 00:47.088
Go!

(grunting)

01:29.840 --> 01:31.383
My dad's company picnic

01:29.840 --> 01:31.383
is tomorrow.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.176
Laurie Millbrook is going

01:31.425 --> 01:33.176
to be there.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.930
I've kind of had a crush on her

01:33.218 --> 01:35.930
since third grade.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.640
(grunting)

01:38.682 --> 01:42.019
I haven't seen her since

01:38.682 --> 01:42.019
she moved across town last year.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.145
I've grown about

01:42.061 --> 01:44.145
four inches since then,

01:44.187 --> 01:46.023
but I can't just count on that.

01:46.065 --> 01:47.983
If I do, like, 10,000

01:46.065 --> 01:47.983
of these tonight,

01:48.025 --> 01:50.360
I should have something

01:48.025 --> 01:50.360
to show by tomorrow.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.153
(grunting)

01:52.195 --> 01:53.447
Dewey, no candy

01:52.195 --> 01:53.447
tomorrow.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.740
Do you understand?

01:54.782 --> 01:55.824
But I'll be fine.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.034
No, you won't.

01:57.076 --> 01:58.619
What happened at the

01:57.076 --> 01:58.619
last company picnic?

01:58.660 --> 02:02.163
I got in a fight

01:58.660 --> 02:02.163
with that redheaded boy.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.498
And why did you do that?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.167
'Cause I ate candy.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.169
Because you ate candy.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.881
You do not metabolize

02:08.211 --> 02:10.881
sugar well.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.173
You get mean

02:10.923 --> 02:12.173
and crazy,

02:12.215 --> 02:14.175
you get into fights

02:12.215 --> 02:14.175
and you end up crying.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.219
Do you want that to

02:14.217 --> 02:16.219
happen again this year?

02:16.261 --> 02:17.638
No.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.056
Now go get

02:17.679 --> 02:19.056
ready for bed.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.432
Okay.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.267
What do you think?

02:20.474 --> 02:22.267
This..

02:22.309 --> 02:24.394
or this?

02:24.436 --> 02:26.229
What are you doing?

02:26.271 --> 02:28.356
This is an important

02:26.271 --> 02:28.356
office function, Lois.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.067
It's a company picnic.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.819
A picnic attended

02:30.109 --> 02:31.819
by my new boss,

02:31.860 --> 02:33.194
whom  I haven't met yet.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.656
I have to start off

02:33.236 --> 02:35.656
on the right foot.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.491
Hal, you're making

02:35.697 --> 02:37.491
too much of this.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.492
No, I am not.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.576
If I've learned one thing

02:39.618 --> 02:41.870
it's that you have to make

02:39.618 --> 02:41.870
a good first impression.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.581
It sets a tone for

02:41.912 --> 02:44.581
the entire relationship.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.207
MAN: Hal, this is your

02:44.623 --> 02:46.207
new supervisor

02:46.249 --> 02:47.793
Ms. Plum.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.210
Great to meet you, Hal.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.005
I'm really looking forward

02:49.252 --> 02:51.005
to working with you.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.297
Same here.

02:52.339 --> 02:56.010
(singsongy): Oh, and

02:52.339 --> 02:56.010
what do we have here?

02:56.051 --> 02:57.845
(chuckling)

02:57.886 --> 03:00.430
(singsongy):

02:57.886 --> 03:00.430
My big fat stomach.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.517
You know, I'd like you

03:01.515 --> 03:03.517
to meet your staff

03:03.558 --> 03:05.226
but I'm not quite sure

03:03.558 --> 03:05.226
where everyone went.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.186
(hushed laughter)

03:08.313 --> 03:10.189
(loud laughter)

03:13.652 --> 03:16.237
It is great to meet you,

03:13.652 --> 03:16.237
Mr. Jacobson.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.405
I just want you to know

03:17.447 --> 03:20.241
that I am going to do

03:17.447 --> 03:20.241
a terrific job for you.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.910
Well, that's great, Hal.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.910
I'm sure you are.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.662
Have you met my daughter

03:21.952 --> 03:23.662
and son-in-law?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.080
No, I haven't

03:23.704 --> 03:25.080
had the pleasure.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.082
Kelly? Steve?

03:27.124 --> 03:29.376
I want you

03:27.124 --> 03:29.376
to meet somebody.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.045
Hi, I'm Hal.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.253
Hi, Hal.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.672
So, nice...

03:33.714 --> 03:35.423
Oh, oh!

03:35.465 --> 03:36.299
Oh, my God!

03:36.341 --> 03:39.553
There's a toothpick in my eye!

03:39.594 --> 03:40.971
She's gushing blood.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.515
For God's sakes, somebody put

03:41.013 --> 03:43.515
a tourniquet on her neck!

03:43.557 --> 03:46.518
KELLY:

03:43.557 --> 03:46.518
I'm outside of my body.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.436
I can see a light.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.313
Grandma, is that you?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.899
You son of a bitch!

03:51.940 --> 03:53.274
I'm going

03:51.940 --> 03:53.274
to chew off your face!

03:53.316 --> 03:54.359
I'm going

03:53.316 --> 03:54.359
to spit it out

03:54.401 --> 03:55.569
and I'm going

03:54.401 --> 03:55.569
to dance on it!

03:55.610 --> 03:56.904
I'm going

03:55.610 --> 03:56.904
to kill you!

03:56.945 --> 03:58.279
I'm going to drag

03:56.945 --> 03:58.279
your carcass

03:58.321 --> 03:59.447
through

03:58.321 --> 03:59.447
the streets!

03:59.489 --> 04:01.449
She's got a toothpick

03:59.489 --> 04:01.449
in her eye!

04:01.491 --> 04:02.492
(screaming)

04:02.534 --> 04:04.870
It's like

04:02.534 --> 04:04.870
a chess game, Lois.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.288
Every subtle move

04:04.912 --> 04:07.288
is vital.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.750
(grunting)

04:07.330 --> 04:09.750
Eight...

04:09.791 --> 04:12.002
(panting)

04:14.963 --> 04:15.797
Oh, my God!

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
What'd you do?

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
You're huge!

04:17.340 --> 04:19.300
Shut up.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.300
I'd be careful.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.511
You might frighten Laurie

04:19.342 --> 04:21.511
with your savage manliness.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.097
Who says I'm doing

04:21.553 --> 04:23.097
it for Laurie?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.140
Oh, so Laurie's

04:23.138 --> 04:25.140
fair game, then?

04:25.182 --> 04:27.308
I wonder if she

04:25.182 --> 04:27.308
likes older men.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.309
Reese, don't.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.686
Look, I really

04:28.351 --> 04:29.686
like this girl.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.312
Please.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.898
It's my first chance

04:31.354 --> 04:32.898
to see her

04:32.940 --> 04:33.899
since she moved away.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.316
I'm asking you

04:33.941 --> 04:35.316
as a brother.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
Please don't be a jerk

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
and screw this up.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.989
Wow, this desperate

04:37.360 --> 04:40.989
groveling is new for you.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.574
Keep it up.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.826
(grunting)

04:44.868 --> 04:46.327
(door opening)

04:46.369 --> 04:48.329
LAVERNIA:

04:46.369 --> 04:48.329
You call yourselves

04:46.369 --> 04:48.329
a hockey team?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.207
If we're going

04:48.371 --> 04:50.207
to beat McAllister Oil,

04:50.249 --> 04:51.332
you're going

04:50.249 --> 04:51.332
to have to play

04:51.374 --> 04:52.918
a hell of a lot

04:51.374 --> 04:52.918
better than that.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.335
You're making

04:52.960 --> 04:54.335
stupid mistakes.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.712
You're missing opportunities.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.714
You got to keep

04:55.754 --> 04:57.714
your mind on the game.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.300
Are our paychecks

04:57.756 --> 05:00.300
here yet?

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
Aren't you done

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
with that sink yet?

05:03.553 --> 05:04.554
Are you kidding?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.514
There's more in here

05:04.596 --> 05:06.514
than when I started.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.349
You're not leaving

05:06.556 --> 05:08.349
till that sink is finished.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.852
It would go a lot faster

05:08.391 --> 05:10.852
if Eric were helping.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.148
I'm not letting my star player

05:10.894 --> 05:14.148
anywhere near that toxic filth.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.941
I slave away all day

05:14.189 --> 05:15.941
by myself

05:15.983 --> 05:17.734
just because

05:15.983 --> 05:17.734
he plays hockey?

05:17.776 --> 05:20.361
He doesn't just play hockey.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.822
He skates like the wind.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.365
And he's got

05:21.863 --> 05:24.365
a 70-mile-an-hour slap shot.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.367
Well, indoors...

05:24.407 --> 05:26.367
fresh ice.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.412
We're going to teach those thugs

05:27.911 --> 05:29.412
from the oil rig a lesson

05:29.454 --> 05:31.039
they'll never forget.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.624
Those chicks won't

05:31.081 --> 05:32.624
know what hit 'em.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.293
You're playing girls?

05:34.334 --> 05:37.378
Well, the men won't play us

05:34.334 --> 05:37.378
till we beat their ladies team.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.797
PETE:

05:37.420 --> 05:38.797
We're fed up

05:37.420 --> 05:38.797
with those girls.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.091
They play dirty,

05:38.839 --> 05:41.091
they make fun of us

05:41.133 --> 05:42.592
and they steal

05:41.133 --> 05:42.592
our women.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.386
Wow. People who

05:42.634 --> 05:45.386
are actually more

05:42.634 --> 05:45.386
humiliated than me.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.763
I'd love

05:45.428 --> 05:46.763
to see that.

05:46.805 --> 05:47.848
Wish granted.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.390
You're our new

05:47.889 --> 05:49.390
equipment manager.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.391
What?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.186
Renaldo came down

05:50.433 --> 05:52.186
with jock lung.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.313
Here's your check.

05:54.353 --> 05:55.647
Here you go, Eric.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.607
There's a little something

05:55.689 --> 05:57.607
extra in there for you.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.483
Thanks.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.442
Wait a minute.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.236
There's no money

05:59.484 --> 06:01.236
in this check.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.403
It says I owe you $14.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.405
I didn't even buy

06:02.445 --> 06:04.405
anything last week.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.783
There's been some

06:04.447 --> 06:06.783
cost of living increases.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.409
Your room, your board,

06:06.825 --> 06:08.409
your pillow rental,

06:08.451 --> 06:09.911
then there's those

06:08.451 --> 06:09.911
rubber gloves

06:09.953 --> 06:11.412
you insist on wearing,

06:09.953 --> 06:11.412
princess.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.998
This is insane.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.916
I'm not going to work

06:13.040 --> 06:14.916
60 hours a week

06:14.958 --> 06:16.835
and still end up

06:14.958 --> 06:16.835
owing you money.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.836
I quit.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.629
Fine. Just give me

06:17.878 --> 06:19.629
the $604 you racked up

06:19.671 --> 06:21.422
since you got here,

06:19.671 --> 06:21.422
you're free to go.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.008
What?

06:23.050 --> 06:26.469
How could I possibly

06:23.050 --> 06:26.469
have $604 when you keep

06:23.050 --> 06:26.469
taking all my money?!

06:26.511 --> 06:27.846
Well, then shut up!

06:27.888 --> 06:29.264
And get back to work.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.724
And you better not

06:30.765 --> 06:32.517
let your equipment

06:30.765 --> 06:32.517
manager duties

06:32.559 --> 06:34.644
get in the way

06:32.559 --> 06:34.644
of your real work.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.399
Man, that sucks.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.112
(phone rings)

06:44.154 --> 06:45.364
Hello.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.447
Malcolm, great.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.447
It's me-- Francis.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
Listen,

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
I'm in a real bind up here...

06:47.991 --> 06:49.450
Francis, I don't have any money.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.451
Wait, hear me out.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
Tell Mom they're sending

06:51.661 --> 06:53.747
all the smart kids

06:51.661 --> 06:53.747
to Washington, DC.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.166
Hit her up for $600

06:53.788 --> 06:56.166
and then just spend

06:56.208 --> 06:57.334
a long a weekend at Stevie's...

06:57.376 --> 06:58.668
Reese, phone.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.461
Hello.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.462
Reese, great.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.673
Um, you know that hardware

07:01.504 --> 07:03.673
store on Second?

07:03.715 --> 07:06.176
Okay, they've got a real

07:03.715 --> 07:06.176
slippery entryway...

07:06.218 --> 07:08.845
Dewey, phone.

07:08.887 --> 07:09.846
Francis?

07:09.888 --> 07:10.764
Yep.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.182
Money?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.182
Yep.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.530
I don't know why

07:25.695 --> 07:27.530
I go to these things.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.699
I am so nervous.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.744
My stomach sounds like

07:29.741 --> 07:32.744
a bunch of dogs fighting.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.870
Listen to this.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.496
Put your ear down there.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.790
Hal, you'll be fine.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.711
What are you doing?

07:41.753 --> 07:42.963
Just keep moving.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.173
Hal, do you even know

07:43.004 --> 07:45.173
your new boss is here?

07:45.215 --> 07:46.925
Are you kidding?

07:45.215 --> 07:46.925
They're all here.

07:46.967 --> 07:47.968
There's Landon.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.511
He's the head

07:48.009 --> 07:50.511
of the whole company.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.763
Of course

07:50.553 --> 07:51.763
the new guy's here.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.764
Don't talk nonsense!

07:52.806 --> 07:54.433
Well, you've never

07:52.806 --> 07:54.433
met the man.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.517
Do you even know

07:54.474 --> 07:56.517
who you're hiding from?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.478
That's a good point.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.522
Barry, is the new boss

07:59.562 --> 08:01.522
here yet?

08:01.564 --> 08:03.358
Yeah. He's right

08:01.564 --> 08:03.358
over there.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.694
Let me know when you're

08:03.400 --> 08:06.694
going to introduce yourself.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.196
Most of us figure

08:08.238 --> 08:09.906
you're going

08:08.238 --> 08:09.906
to set him on fire.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.616
Hey, no fair giving

08:09.948 --> 08:11.616
him ideas. Bet's off.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.618
Come on, fellas, I'm

08:11.658 --> 08:13.618
nervous enough as it is.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.912
Hal, we're just

08:13.660 --> 08:15.912
teasing you.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.622
Come on. You'll do fine.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.791
You and I both know

08:17.664 --> 08:19.791
that's a lie.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.043
Yeah, well, I tried.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.722
Oh, hi, Mom.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.808
Splendid day

08:34.764 --> 08:36.808
for a picnic.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.352
You want to do this

08:36.850 --> 08:38.352
the easy way

08:38.393 --> 08:39.394
or the hard way?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.646
The hard way.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.857
Spread 'em.

08:50.113 --> 08:53.658
Honey, I'm not always going

08:50.113 --> 08:53.658
to be around to do this.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.785
You have

08:53.700 --> 08:55.785
to control yourself.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.412
I know.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.292
Undies.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.009
Malcolm?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.593
Laurie, hi.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.554
It's so good

09:12.635 --> 09:14.554
to see you.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.599
Yeah... good

09:16.056 --> 09:18.599
to see you, too.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.520
Wow, I can't believe

09:18.641 --> 09:21.520
how tall you are.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.812
Yeah... well, you know.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.105
Oh, man,

09:24.147 --> 09:25.606
I've missed

09:24.147 --> 09:25.606
you guys so much.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.983
I've missed you, too...

09:27.025 --> 09:29.403
I mean, we've

09:27.025 --> 09:29.403
all missed you.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.112
Everyone. Not just me.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.198
Hey, are you doing that

09:31.154 --> 09:33.198
three-legged scavenger hunt?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.699
The what?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.699
They tie your leg

09:34.741 --> 09:36.410
to another person

09:34.741 --> 09:36.410
and send you off

09:36.451 --> 09:37.618
into the woods

09:36.451 --> 09:37.618
to find stuff.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.538
It might be fun.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.538
Plus you can win $100.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.081
I just need

09:39.579 --> 09:41.081
a partner.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.333
Do you want to do it?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.625
Really?

09:44.667 --> 09:45.919
Yeah. It sounds great.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.712
Cool.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.630
Is that your brother?

09:49.672 --> 09:50.840
Hi, Reese.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.300
Sorry, I'm gay.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.094
Okay.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.597
(mouthing)

10:01.059 --> 10:04.438
You work for the company

10:01.059 --> 10:04.438
or are you a drag-along?

10:04.479 --> 10:05.813
Definitely a drag-along.

10:05.855 --> 10:06.940
Oh, me, too.

10:05.855 --> 10:06.940
Me, too.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.443
My husband drags me along

10:06.981 --> 10:09.443
to these functions,

10:09.484 --> 10:11.445
then he runs off

10:09.484 --> 10:11.445
and talks to his friends.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.071
I hide.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.071
Hide?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.282
From my kids.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.242
It's so great to have

10:15.323 --> 10:17.242
somebody to talk to.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.160
I'm really so bad

10:17.284 --> 10:19.160
at social situations.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.496
My psychiatrist says

10:21.538 --> 10:23.498
that I'm emotionally

10:21.538 --> 10:23.498
detached

10:23.540 --> 10:25.708
and that I have

10:23.540 --> 10:25.708
paranoid fantasies

10:25.750 --> 10:28.753
about what people

10:25.750 --> 10:28.753
are thinking about me.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.172
Uh-huh.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.673
Yeah.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.759
Sometimes it can

10:32.715 --> 10:34.759
get really ugly.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.678
False accusations,

10:34.801 --> 10:37.678
crying jags.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.680
I don't know why

10:37.720 --> 10:39.680
my husband married me.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.558
Oh, I mean, I know

10:39.722 --> 10:41.558
why I married him, of course.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.269
Because I'm addicted

10:41.600 --> 10:44.269
to disapproval.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.686
Ah. Really?

10:45.728 --> 10:47.730
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.983
Of course, I only have

10:47.772 --> 10:49.983
myself to blame

10:50.024 --> 10:52.277
because he's exactly

10:50.024 --> 10:52.277
like my father was.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.572
Oh, my God,

10:52.319 --> 10:55.572
he was so judgmental.

10:55.614 --> 10:56.781
Every time

10:55.614 --> 10:56.781
I opened my mouth,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.699
I felt like

10:56.823 --> 10:58.699
I was torturing him.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.996
Go! Good hustle!

11:03.037 --> 11:05.706
Nice slashing!

11:05.748 --> 11:07.334
Guys, let's go!

11:07.375 --> 11:08.793
Keep it moving!

11:08.835 --> 11:10.711
Keep your legs moving!

11:10.753 --> 11:13.298
Good!

11:13.340 --> 11:15.716
Push it!

11:15.758 --> 11:16.801
Good move, Wendy!

11:16.843 --> 11:18.136
Don't relax!

11:18.178 --> 11:19.804
Wow, they're good.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.140
They got nothing

11:19.846 --> 11:22.140
on my boy.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.517
How's the diarrhea?

11:23.558 --> 11:24.643
You feeling all right?

11:24.683 --> 11:25.726
Tip-top.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.562
Hey, Coach, there's Lavernia.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.524
I hear she might actually

11:27.604 --> 11:30.524
have a team this year.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.317
You think we ought

11:30.565 --> 11:32.317
to adjust the front line?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.653
Clarence... Clarence.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.530
What?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.739
Oh, hey, Lavernia.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.824
I was afraid

11:39.866 --> 11:41.742
you'd show

11:39.866 --> 11:41.742
your face.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.662
Not that I was afraid

11:41.784 --> 11:43.662
you'd play me--

11:43.702 --> 11:46.914
just that you'd

11:43.702 --> 11:46.914
show your face. Ha!

11:46.956 --> 11:48.333
Hello, Clarence.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.752
I thought you only gave

11:48.375 --> 11:51.752
your pep talks in your van.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.754
Ah, you'll get a boyfriend

11:51.794 --> 11:53.754
one of these days.

11:53.796 --> 11:57.133
You'll have that

11:53.796 --> 11:57.133
moment of bliss,

11:57.175 --> 11:58.759
and then you'll

11:57.175 --> 11:58.759
bite his head off

11:58.801 --> 12:01.221
and lay your rotten eggs

11:58.801 --> 12:01.221
down his decapitated body.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.682
Come on, was that

12:01.262 --> 12:03.682
comment necessary?

12:03.722 --> 12:05.850
That's exactly why

12:03.722 --> 12:05.850
people don't like you.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.686
People like me.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.770
Who doesn't like me?

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
I got a good feeling

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
about today.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.940
Look at these girls.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.150
They're not

12:12.982 --> 12:14.150
so tough.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.485
Wait till I get

12:14.192 --> 12:15.485
out there.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.570
I'm going to go...

12:16.611 --> 12:17.736
(screams)

12:29.624 --> 12:32.586
How's my breath?

12:32.627 --> 12:34.003
It seems fine.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.796
Not too minty?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.173
'Cause that can

12:35.838 --> 12:37.173
be just as bad.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.008
Please give me

12:37.215 --> 12:39.008
back my compact.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.724
Okay, get in, get out.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.766
Just say hello and go.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.686
Nope.

12:49.728 --> 12:50.729
(gasps)

12:50.769 --> 12:52.188
Mr. Landon, hello.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.398
Hey, Hal.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.982
I told you about the first time

12:53.440 --> 12:54.982
I met this guy, right?

12:55.024 --> 12:56.817
The urinal cake guy.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.027
(laughing)

12:58.069 --> 12:59.028
Unbelievable.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.614
But I didn't

12:59.070 --> 13:00.614
fire him.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.657
He's turned out to be

13:00.655 --> 13:02.657
one of our finest

13:02.699 --> 13:03.824
systems managers.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.702
Just goes to show you

13:03.866 --> 13:05.702
that even a gibbering idiot

13:05.744 --> 13:07.203
can surprise you.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.872
Oh, you know, sir, that would

13:07.245 --> 13:09.872
make a great chapter heading

13:09.914 --> 13:10.831
for your new book.

13:10.873 --> 13:14.001
I thought he dropped

13:10.873 --> 13:14.001
his pill case.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.837
Excuse me for being considerate.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.757
Hi. John Pratt!

13:18.797 --> 13:20.467
It is a pleasure

13:18.797 --> 13:20.467
to meet you!

13:20.508 --> 13:21.551
Hi.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.677
You are a hard man to find.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.012
I finally had to have

13:22.719 --> 13:25.012
someone point you out.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.848
Well, it's not like

13:25.054 --> 13:27.848
I'm avoiding you.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.644
(both laughing)

13:30.685 --> 13:32.853
I had heard you had

13:30.685 --> 13:32.853
a great sense of humor.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.566
I know it's just

13:34.314 --> 13:36.566
going to be great

13:34.314 --> 13:36.566
working with you.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.485
Oh, yeah?

13:36.608 --> 13:38.485
Yeah.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.573
Well, I-I should get back

13:39.902 --> 13:43.573
to my family now.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.532
Oh, right, right.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.866
I'm sorry to hold you up.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.369
It is a real pleasure

13:45.908 --> 13:48.369
to meet you, Mr. Landon.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.622
Same here.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
(gasps)

14:01.924 --> 14:04.469
All right, boys,

14:01.924 --> 14:04.469
you got ten minutes.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.887
Leave your wallets

14:04.511 --> 14:06.887
and other valuables in here.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.888
And hustle up.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.266
We got to get out on

14:07.930 --> 14:10.266
the ice and warm up.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.892
I don't think I can play.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.354
My glute cramped up

14:11.934 --> 14:14.354
on the ride over.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.355
You have to play.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.065
Go lay down

14:15.396 --> 14:18.065
on that table.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.484
You.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.819
Get over there.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.153
Give him a good,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.153
strong massage.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.405
Work that knot

14:22.195 --> 14:24.405
out of his glute.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.199
Out of his what?

14:29.536 --> 14:30.829
No way!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.413
He's our goalie.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.413
We need him.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.206
No!

14:33.247 --> 14:35.834
Look, you owe me $604.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.753
You do this,

14:35.875 --> 14:38.753
I'll take off a dollar fifty.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.087
A dollar fifty?!

14:40.129 --> 14:41.088
And if you don't,

14:41.130 --> 14:43.800
I'll charge you 50 bucks

14:41.130 --> 14:43.800
for the ride home.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.635
The rest of you

14:43.842 --> 14:45.635
get out there!

14:45.677 --> 14:47.846
(players shouting)

14:45.677 --> 14:47.846
Show them what you got.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.930
Here, you're responsible

14:47.887 --> 14:49.930
for these valuables

14:49.972 --> 14:51.474
till after the game.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.936
Don't be afraid

14:52.975 --> 14:55.936
to dig in deep.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.773
If it helps, I'll

14:55.978 --> 14:58.773
unhitch the trapdoor.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.945
(grunting)

15:04.987 --> 15:07.031
LAVERNIA:

15:04.987 --> 15:07.031
Get up, you idiot!

15:07.073 --> 15:08.949
What, are you stupid?!

15:08.991 --> 15:10.744
(yelps)

15:10.785 --> 15:11.994
(groans)

15:12.036 --> 15:14.539
I said hustle to the crease!

15:14.581 --> 15:16.207
Hustle!

15:16.249 --> 15:18.418
Hey, I was just hanging out

15:16.249 --> 15:18.418
in the locker room

15:18.459 --> 15:19.960
and the other coach

15:18.459 --> 15:19.960
approached me.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.047
What's that gin-soaked,

15:20.002 --> 15:23.047
reptilian sack of dog logs

15:23.089 --> 15:24.424
trying to pull now?

15:24.465 --> 15:26.342
He wants to make

15:24.465 --> 15:26.342
a little wager with you

15:26.384 --> 15:27.968
on the outcome of the game.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.597
$642 to be exact.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.972
I don't bet.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.183
I earn my money,

15:32.014 --> 15:34.183
and I hold on to it.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.895
Yeah, he said

15:34.225 --> 15:36.895
you'd be afraid.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.646
Oh, he did?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.815
He also said that

15:38.688 --> 15:40.815
John Grisham was a hack

15:40.857 --> 15:43.984
with no sense of plot

15:40.857 --> 15:43.984
and a tin ear for dialogue.

15:44.026 --> 15:44.985
What?!

15:45.027 --> 15:46.487
He said that

15:45.027 --> 15:46.487
about Mr. Grisham?

15:46.529 --> 15:50.199
All right, he wants

15:46.529 --> 15:50.199
to bet, we'll bet.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.910
Tell him to make it $700.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.162
He was pretty adamant

15:51.951 --> 15:55.162
about the $642.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.372
Fine.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.998
Hey, Chuck!

15:58.040 --> 16:00.376
I need you to hold on

15:58.040 --> 16:00.376
to some bet money.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.629
Okay.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.005
That idiot Clarence

16:02.670 --> 16:05.005
has no idea

16:05.047 --> 16:07.508
what we've got

16:05.047 --> 16:07.508
in store for him.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.927
Go, go!

16:08.968 --> 16:09.844
Go!

16:09.886 --> 16:11.053
Oh, ho-ho!

16:11.095 --> 16:13.180
(cheering)

16:13.222 --> 16:16.309
Easiest $700 I ever made.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.184
(whistle blows)

16:17.226 --> 16:19.019
I don't know

16:17.226 --> 16:19.019
what's with my skates.

16:19.061 --> 16:19.938
The blades are so dull.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.064
Hey, somebody unscrewed mine.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.610
I got Vaseline

16:22.106 --> 16:25.610
all over my grip tape.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.736
(buzzer sounds)

16:26.778 --> 16:29.029
MAN:

16:26.778 --> 16:29.029
Go, go, go, go!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.949
(all yelling)

16:30.990 --> 16:32.492
(sighing)

16:32.533 --> 16:34.535
MEG:

16:32.533 --> 16:34.535
He is never home.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.203
The last time that

16:34.577 --> 16:36.203
we had dinner together

16:36.245 --> 16:37.455
was six months ago.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.915
And that was with his boss.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.250
Oh, and did I tell you

16:38.957 --> 16:41.250
about our anniversary?

16:41.292 --> 16:42.877
I bought $30 worth

16:41.292 --> 16:42.877
of candles.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.044
$30 worth.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.339
And I was wearing a negligee

16:44.086 --> 16:46.339
the size of a postage stamp.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.842
He walks in an hour late,

16:46.380 --> 16:48.842
goes straight to the computer

16:48.883 --> 16:50.718
and spends the next six hours

16:48.883 --> 16:50.718
in a chat room.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.554
I drank an entire

16:50.760 --> 16:53.554
bottle of champagne.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.056
Then I passed out and

16:53.596 --> 16:56.056
I woke up the next morning

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
with the dog licking my face.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.895
And I actually thought

16:58.100 --> 17:00.895
it was my husband.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.355
I'm going to go see

17:00.937 --> 17:02.355
what my boys...

17:02.396 --> 17:04.273
I mean, as if

17:02.396 --> 17:04.273
he would ever show me

17:04.315 --> 17:05.525
any kind of affection.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.067
I mean, as far

17:05.566 --> 17:07.067
as he's concerned,

17:07.109 --> 17:08.528
I am still the fat lady

17:08.569 --> 17:10.070
that answered

17:08.569 --> 17:10.070
his psychiatrist's phone.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.073
I mean, in my mind

17:13.115 --> 17:15.284
I do see myself

17:13.115 --> 17:15.284
as a 200-pounder.

17:15.326 --> 17:18.287
But I have seen the way

17:15.326 --> 17:18.287
that other men look at me.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.539
Wanda!

17:19.580 --> 17:21.081
Oh, it's so good

17:19.580 --> 17:21.081
to see you again.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.542
Wanda, this is Meg.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.542
Meg, this is Wanda.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.335
Why don't you two get

17:22.583 --> 17:24.335
to know each other.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.004
I'm going to get

17:24.377 --> 17:26.004
something to drink.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.087
I'll be right back.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.464
Um...

17:28.506 --> 17:31.091
So, how do you know Lois?

17:31.133 --> 17:34.053
Que?

17:36.347 --> 17:38.098
I like you.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.098
You're fun.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.976
I like you, too.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.644
Want some of my candy?

17:43.145 --> 17:44.104
(crying)

17:44.146 --> 17:47.817
But he... My... my candy!

17:47.859 --> 17:49.610
(screaming)

17:49.652 --> 17:51.111
You fill up

17:49.652 --> 17:51.111
on that bread.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.907
Better you get sick

17:51.153 --> 17:53.907
on that than on candy.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.115
You understand me?

17:55.157 --> 17:57.117
I got enough

17:55.157 --> 17:57.117
to worry about

17:57.159 --> 17:59.453
without you going

17:57.159 --> 17:59.453
crazy on me.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.042
Stay here!

18:11.049 --> 18:12.050
(gasps)

18:12.091 --> 18:13.133
Hi, Lois.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.427
Are you hiding back here?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.596
No, no.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.596
Just enjoying the shade.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.138
Did you meet your

18:16.637 --> 18:18.138
new boss yet?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.849
Yep.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.849
Well, how did it go?

18:19.891 --> 18:22.018
Fine. Good guy.

18:19.891 --> 18:22.018
We really hit it off.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.811
What happened?

18:23.853 --> 18:25.229
What do you mean,

18:23.853 --> 18:25.229
"What happened?"

18:25.271 --> 18:26.564
It went well.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.564
He likes me.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.148
Is that such

18:26.606 --> 18:28.148
a hard thing to imagine

18:28.190 --> 18:29.609
I made a good

18:28.190 --> 18:29.609
first impression?

18:29.650 --> 18:30.985
PRATT:

18:29.650 --> 18:30.985
Hey, Mr. Landon!

18:31.027 --> 18:32.236
You should give me

18:31.027 --> 18:32.236
a little credit.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.154
Mr. Landon! Hey, boss!

18:34.196 --> 18:35.197
Is that man

18:34.196 --> 18:35.197
call...

18:35.239 --> 18:36.240
Of course he isn't.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.158
Whatever you were

18:36.282 --> 18:38.158
going to say--

18:38.200 --> 18:39.994
whatever that was--

18:38.200 --> 18:39.994
he isn't.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.955
Hal, I'm not going

18:40.036 --> 18:41.955
anywhere until you ex...

18:41.996 --> 18:43.414
Lois! Lois!

18:44.665 --> 18:46.751
PRATT:

18:44.665 --> 18:46.751
Excuse me.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.502
Mr. Landon!

18:51.255 --> 18:52.840
So, did I tell you

18:52.882 --> 18:55.802
that his mother

18:52.882 --> 18:55.802
is coming to visit me this week?

18:55.843 --> 18:59.179
I mean, she despises me,

18:55.843 --> 18:59.179
but at least she talks to me.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.974
My husband, on the other hand

19:01.015 --> 19:03.601
hasn't said two words

19:01.015 --> 19:03.601
besides "Where's the remote?"

19:03.643 --> 19:06.186
and "How far are those

19:03.643 --> 19:06.186
going to sag?"

19:06.228 --> 19:07.563
This really isn't

19:06.228 --> 19:07.563
a good time.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.189
And every year

19:09.231 --> 19:10.900
he has to go to this

19:09.231 --> 19:10.900
stupid get-together

19:10.942 --> 19:12.234
for his old friends

19:10.942 --> 19:12.234
from college.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.987
We're about to walk

19:12.276 --> 19:13.987
into this party

19:14.028 --> 19:15.071
and he turns to me

19:15.113 --> 19:16.864
and he tells me

19:15.113 --> 19:16.864
not to say anything stupid.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.199
Well, how's a person

19:16.906 --> 19:19.199
supposed to respond to that?

19:19.241 --> 19:20.200
I embarrass him one time.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.201
I mean, big deal

19:21.243 --> 19:22.411
I didn't know who

19:21.243 --> 19:22.411
Ernest Hemingway was.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.163
I mean a lot

19:22.453 --> 19:24.163
of people don't.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.834
All right, girls.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.834
Secure.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.628
Okay, Pete and Kathy,

19:27.875 --> 19:30.628
you're next.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.587
(giggling)

19:31.629 --> 19:33.923
It's so great to see

19:31.629 --> 19:33.923
you again, Malcolm.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.675
Great to see you, too.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.927
For those of you

19:35.716 --> 19:37.927
without partners

19:37.969 --> 19:39.720
we've done

19:37.969 --> 19:39.720
a random pairing.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.221
Mike and Cristina.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.141
Reese and George.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.642
I'm Reese.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.435
I'm George.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.228
You can call me George.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.898
I can eat eight hot dogs.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.152
That's good, George.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.904
You've got to be kidding me.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.280
It's really weird

19:56.946 --> 19:58.280
being away

19:58.322 --> 20:00.033
from all my friends

19:58.322 --> 20:00.033
I grew up with.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.492
I'll bet.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.912
Malcolm, can I

20:01.534 --> 20:04.912
ask you something?

20:04.954 --> 20:07.040
Sure.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.290
If you liked somebody

20:08.332 --> 20:11.251
and you had no idea

20:08.332 --> 20:11.251
if they liked you back,

20:11.293 --> 20:13.046
would you say something?

20:13.087 --> 20:16.256
I've always thought

20:13.087 --> 20:16.256
honesty was a good thing.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.633
Me, too.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.260
But... what if they

20:17.675 --> 20:20.260
lived too far away

20:20.302 --> 20:22.847
and it'd be really hard?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.932
I like you, too, Laurie.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.767
I really, really like you.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.769
Honestly,

20:26.809 --> 20:28.769
you have no idea.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.104
I've liked you for years.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.065
I think about you

20:30.146 --> 20:32.065
all the time.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.315
Oh, no.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.275
What?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.360
Oh, my God.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.487
I am so sorry.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.281
I was talking

20:38.529 --> 20:41.281
about Gary Spindler.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.533
Oh, no.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.284
Oh. It's okay.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.286
No. This is so humiliating

20:46.328 --> 20:47.287
and it's all my fault.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.332
Oh, Malcolm, I am so sorry.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.085
Really, it's not that...

20:52.126 --> 20:54.045
Malcolm and Laurie.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.215
Now remember,

20:57.256 --> 21:00.134
you're only going

20:57.256 --> 21:00.134
to be tied together

20:57.256 --> 21:00.134
for three hours,

21:00.176 --> 21:01.969
so let's get hopping.
