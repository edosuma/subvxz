02:49.045 --> 02:50.045
Your keys, sir.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.756
Have a good evening.

03:09.065 --> 03:10.066
All clear, sir.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.319
Thank you, number one.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.683
Well, well, what have we here?

03:50.731 --> 03:51.982
Keep her close.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.485
I won't be staying long.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.737
Si, senorita.

04:02.451 --> 04:05.246
It's a very good
catwoman costume, my dear,

04:05.621 --> 04:06.956
if a trifle dated.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.374
What can I say?

04:08.666 --> 04:10.960
I have an appreciation for the classics.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.129
As do I, my dear.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.464
As do I.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.928
It's invitation only, sir.

04:23.806 --> 04:26.934
I believe that covers
my entire entourage.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.395
Yes, sir. Please enjoy
the masquerade, sir.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.089
Sionis.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.928
Stand down, gentlemen.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.223
Tobias whale here works for our hostess.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.100
Excuse me.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.977
I must pay my respects.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.270
Find me later.

05:11.604 --> 05:13.522
Oh, count on it.

05:25.451 --> 05:28.913
Allow me to introduce you
to the leader of leviathan,

05:29.371 --> 05:31.290
lady Barbara Minerva.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.336
Lady Barbara, this is Roman sionis,

05:35.544 --> 05:38.589
known in Gotham city as black mask.

05:40.716 --> 05:44.053
It's an honor to finally meet
the big boss in person.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.556
I don't see myself
as any kind of boss.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.769
Leviathan is more
of a cooperative organization.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.269
We help each other.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.773
That's exactly what impressed me,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.983
and I am not easily impressed.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.860
Neither am I, I'm afraid.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.321
I trust you have your entrance fee.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.365
Right here.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.120
I assume you can secure it
until we're ready to depart.

06:10.871 --> 06:11.871
I can.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.018
Darling, I love your costume.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.104
Oof, hold on to that one, love,

06:35.187 --> 06:36.855
or I mightjust steal him away.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.441
Did you purchase that diamond

06:39.525 --> 06:41.443
or just seduce it onto your finger?

06:43.487 --> 06:45.364
Oof, hold on to that one, love,

06:45.447 --> 06:47.157
or I mightjust steal her away.

06:49.618 --> 06:50.828
Excuse me.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.830
This little kitty needs
to powder her nose.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.676
There. Now let's return to the party.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.430
Oh, I heard about sochi.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.973
Most unfortunate.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.392
It was a promising operation.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.145
Mm-hmm. I will only say this once.

07:16.312 --> 07:18.731
Sochi was a minor setback.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.025
These things happen sometimes.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.570
The point, of course,
is that our operation

07:24.653 --> 07:27.364
is large enough to absorb such losses.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.658
Don't let it concern you.

07:40.753 --> 07:42.004
Oh, come on.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.048
It's that darn cat again.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.758
I told you to catch him.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.135
You ever tried catching a cat
on a hot tiled roof?

07:48.260 --> 07:51.096
This is like the 80th time
he's set off the motion sensors.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.407
The boss is gonna to kill us

07:52.431 --> 07:53.974
if the alarm disturbs her guests.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.851
Just shut it off. Shut it off!

07:56.810 --> 07:59.063
Yeah, yeah, we don't need
the motion sensors.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.439
We still got the cameras.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.024
Exactly!

08:19.792 --> 08:22.002
You know, I appreciate the classics,

08:22.586 --> 08:24.046
but I move with the times.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.071
Hmm. Cameras are so much easier to fool

08:49.154 --> 08:50.447
than motion sensors.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.533
You get picked for the out of town trip?

08:52.783 --> 08:53.867
Nah. You?

08:53.951 --> 08:55.828
I wish. One night's work

08:55.911 --> 08:57.413
and four nights enjoying wherever.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.789
Would have been sweet, you know?

08:58.956 --> 09:01.250
Yeah. Sucks being a grade 3.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.001
We never get the soft gigs.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.713
A lady always accessorizes with care.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.144
The cat's eye emerald!

11:26.228 --> 11:30.023
Darling, you're even
more gorgeous in person.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.951
Yes! Purr-fect match.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.456
I'm smiling, too.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.839
I am no longer smiling.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.052
Not smiling at all.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.725
That perfect crime
went south awfully fast.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.144
Remind me to lay a few choice words

12:07.227 --> 12:09.354
on the bat the next time I see him.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.818
Open fire!

12:18.363 --> 12:19.363
Get her!

12:28.916 --> 12:31.501
What the bloody hell is...

12:42.679 --> 12:45.098
Stop her! All of you!

12:45.432 --> 12:47.851
- Now!
- Now!

12:53.273 --> 12:56.401
All right. No need to get excited.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.904
I thought this was supposed
to be a party.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.368
Ooh, my kind of party.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.286
Out of the way, you idiots.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.412
Excuse me.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.418
Hey, take this, you...

13:25.931 --> 13:27.432
Here, try the caviar.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.393
What the hell is that?

13:35.107 --> 13:35.983
Is this your guy?

13:36.066 --> 13:37.786
Hold on tight
or I mightjust steal him away.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.371
Ah, I love your pearls.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.123
Might just steal those away too.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.089
I don't believe
we've been properly introduced.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.049
The name's selina Kyle,

14:01.299 --> 14:02.551
but please,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.178
call me catwoman.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.307
Move!

14:12.728 --> 14:14.438
Aw, thanks for keeping her close.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.314
Eh, senorita, your key!

14:20.152 --> 14:21.570
Isis, play.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.322
Cat's eye, meet cat's paw.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.533
Your key, senorita!

14:26.616 --> 14:29.536
- You give her the key, you die.
- Si, senor.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.663
It's okay. I have a spare.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.208
Don't just stand there, get her!

14:35.292 --> 14:36.812
Lovely party.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.128
Hate to steal and run.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.636
- The keys, damn it.
- Si, senor.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.139
Mount up! Take all of them.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.932
- You, drive.
- Yes, sir.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.768
Move, all of you!

14:53.143 --> 14:54.436
She's not getting away.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.298
Good girl.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.383
Don't want to lose that little pretty.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.707
It would kind of defeat
the whole purpose of the evening.

15:37.020 --> 15:37.854
Speed up.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.689
Trying not to drive off the cliff.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.526
Speed up or I'll throw you
off the cliff.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.402
Yes, sir.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.581
Why aren't you firing?

15:56.665 --> 15:58.792
Because we don't want her damn car

15:58.875 --> 16:01.586
flying off the damn cliff
with the damn emerald!

16:01.711 --> 16:03.088
Oh, yeah, right.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.297
Idiot.

16:07.759 --> 16:08.969
Go, do it!

16:22.232 --> 16:24.609
Clearly, this fool's never
had a date in his life

16:24.693 --> 16:26.945
or he'd know a woman can lay a man low

16:27.028 --> 16:29.030
with a single swish of her hips.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.434
Pull over, or we'll make you pull over!

16:57.642 --> 16:59.686
Oh, sorry. Can't.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.522
I'm being chased
by some truly horrible people.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.900
And if! Pull over, they might catch me.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.776
Pincer!

17:08.320 --> 17:11.448
Did you just tell him
to pinch me?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.742
That's really inappropriate, young man.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.662
Not "pinch her." "Pincer." Pincer!

17:17.787 --> 17:19.164
Oh, well, that's very different.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.332
Never mind.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.459
Just do it!

17:30.050 --> 17:32.928
I know. That was almost
worse than a pinch.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.055
Again. Hold her this time.

18:44.124 --> 18:48.044
Now, let's see if we can lose
those unwanted suitors.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.129
[Gunshofl

18:49.212 --> 18:51.047
now I can shoot.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.423
[Gunshofl

18:57.887 --> 18:59.055
Cut her off.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.396
- Get ready.
- For what?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.480
Foryourshofl

19:07.564 --> 19:08.982
oh, yeah. Right.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.952
I said get up!

19:24.914 --> 19:27.625
Okay. Now you pull over, or you die.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.461
Is that an order?

19:29.544 --> 19:31.421
That's exactly what it is.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.633
You see, the thing is,

19:35.717 --> 19:37.260
I don't do well with orders.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.680
Oh, sorry, baby.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.140
Mommy will fix it.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.276
There, doors are locked

19:53.360 --> 19:55.362
and no one else is getting in.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.325
Yes, I know.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.243
We're in a convertible. Ugh.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.205
It was a symbolic gesture.
I swear, Isis,

20:05.288 --> 20:07.248
for a cat, you are so literal-minded.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.103
Come on! Get the doors open!

20:28.186 --> 20:29.270
They're stuck!

20:40.281 --> 20:41.908
The street widens up ahead.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.618
Pull alongside.

20:43.701 --> 20:44.953
Roger that, boss.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.632
Honey, you should really watch
where you're going.

21:14.399 --> 21:17.444
Boss? Boss? A little help?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.321
Please?

21:20.738 --> 21:22.407
There, you see?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.659
I told you we'd get away clean.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.496
Yeah, you never doubted it
for a moment, right?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.855
Oh, great.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.024
Congratulations, selina.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.359
You just became
leviathan's number one target.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.265
Mm-hmm.

22:29.557 --> 22:30.934
It is the real thing.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.686
And I'm supposed to thank you
for recovering it?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.897
I put it in your hands, in your vault.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.442
I thought leviathan
had better security than this.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.907
I'm not the one
who escorted her into the party.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.575
Hmm.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.495
Uh, apologies.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.831
I suppose mistakes were made
on all sides

22:53.915 --> 22:56.918
and in the end, no harm done.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.254
Oh, harm was done.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.714
This little kitten
has sauntered into the lair

23:01.798 --> 23:03.216
of the wrong big cat.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.552
Such an affront must not stand.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.470
And I promise you,

23:07.971 --> 23:10.598
selina Kyle will not go unpunished.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.446
Oh, Isis, stop!

23:26.447 --> 23:28.199
Mama's trying to sleep.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.860
Mama should be trying
to stay out of prison.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.289
Ugh.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.961
Ugh, if I'd have known it was you,
I wouldn't have hit the brakes.

23:40.378 --> 23:42.213
Please. You knew it was me.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.173
I see my cat.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.301
I don't see my cat's eye emerald.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.345
Nope, I left that behind
for whale to find.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.181
Wait. That batarang...

23:52.265 --> 23:53.683
Here it comes.

23:54.392 --> 23:55.435
That was you.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.228
Almost there.

23:57.312 --> 24:00.940
You screwed up my extremely
well-planned heist on purpose?

24:01.524 --> 24:03.276
See? I knew you'd put it together.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.278
Wow. Seriously,

24:05.361 --> 24:07.196
you are such a little do-gooder,

24:07.280 --> 24:09.324
you won't even let
a harmless sneak thief

24:09.407 --> 24:10.950
steal from gangsters?

24:11.743 --> 24:12.619
You're not harmless.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.746
And Barbara Minerva is no mere gangster.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.789
Really?

24:16.873 --> 24:18.041
Well, do tell.

24:18.750 --> 24:19.876
Come on.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.419
Enlighten me.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.046
Ugh, no, thanks.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.714
I know you're just stalling for time,

24:24.797 --> 24:26.841
trying to figure out
your little escape plan.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.347
No, no. I can see escape
isn't in my near future

24:32.430 --> 24:34.140
since we're aboard a private jet.

24:34.265 --> 24:37.769
Ajet flying east, if I'm not mistaken.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.772
Mm, very good.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.065
Introductions.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.108
Selina Kyle, meet Interpol agents

24:44.192 --> 24:46.361
Julia pennyworth and king Faraday.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.196
We're already acquainted.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.323
Unfortunately.

24:50.907 --> 24:54.077
Oh, Julia. King.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.163
Is that any way
to talk to an old friend?

24:57.538 --> 24:59.123
Selina, we're not friends.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.125
I'm a police officer. You're a thief.

25:01.876 --> 25:04.545
Oh, and you're clearly corrupt

25:04.629 --> 25:06.339
because the last time I checked,

25:06.422 --> 25:09.550
civil servants didn't rate
luxury accommodations

25:09.634 --> 25:11.844
like these.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.222
We confiscated the jet from the penguin.

25:15.306 --> 25:17.809
Oh, that explains it.

25:17.975 --> 25:21.354
For a flightless bird, oswald
always did love the high life.

25:26.401 --> 25:29.445
So, other than east,

25:30.071 --> 25:31.656
where exactly are we headed?

25:32.240 --> 25:33.282
We don't know yet.

25:33.491 --> 25:36.119
Can't you just, uh, ask the pilot?

25:37.745 --> 25:39.455
We're tracking black mask and Minerva.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.958
Thanks to a liquid tracker
I sprayed on the emerald

25:42.041 --> 25:44.252
in Gotham prior
to black mask acquiring it.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.507
Oh, so that's why
you thought it was essential

25:49.632 --> 25:53.094
that the cat's eye
stay with its current owners.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.555
Minerva is stepping up.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.390
She's built her leviathan
crime syndicate

25:57.473 --> 26:00.143
on narcotics, blackmail,
human trafficking, etcetera.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.478
It's now richer than many countries.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.522
Mm.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.024
Penguin does know his bubbly.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.737
I am glad it suits your tastes.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.156
And what suits yours, king?

26:13.823 --> 26:15.825
As if I don't already know.

26:16.159 --> 26:19.370
Well, what would suit me is, uh,

26:19.537 --> 26:21.831
Interpol taking leviathan apart

26:21.914 --> 26:24.667
while I slap cuffs
on lady Barbara Minerva.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.170
So do it.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.130
Not just yet.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.299
Tracking Minerva and mask will lead us

26:31.382 --> 26:33.760
to a meeting of the entire
criminal cartel

26:33.843 --> 26:35.678
that black mask
is currently trying to join

26:35.803 --> 26:37.805
using the eye as his entrance fee.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.642
Which has exactly what to do with me?

26:46.022 --> 26:49.192
Multiple countries have
multiple warrants out for your arrest.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.819
I always was popular.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.989
You have been on
quite the global tear lately.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.950
You would think Jewel thievery
had an expiration date.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.119
Why the sudden rush?

27:00.912 --> 27:03.247
You're usually much lazier than that.

27:03.414 --> 27:08.085
Languid, not lazy.

27:11.255 --> 27:14.592
I can take action
when properly motivated.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.762
As luck would have it,
we'd like to offer you motivation.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.307
Oh, I'm listening.

27:22.266 --> 27:26.270
You help us bust Minerva,
black mask and the rest of leviathan,

27:26.687 --> 27:29.232
and we make
all those warrants disappear.

27:30.608 --> 27:31.818
Okay.

27:31.901 --> 27:35.655
And if I pass on said generous offer?

27:36.405 --> 27:37.406
Incarceration.

27:38.449 --> 27:40.743
We're talking about
your freedom, selina.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.162
If you cooperate.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.874
Cooperate how?

27:47.500 --> 27:49.210
By making yourself a target.

27:56.551 --> 27:57.844
The line's secure.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.513
You've been
apprised of the circumstances?

28:01.639 --> 28:02.723
Good.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.853
Then I believe you'll agree
an example must be made.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.523
Catwoman must die,

28:11.190 --> 28:14.235
so let me know if you need me
to provide resources.

28:14.652 --> 28:15.945
Not necessary.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.573
I never cared for that feline.

28:19.907 --> 28:23.327
And I have just
the right woman for the job.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.356
Shanghai?

28:53.733 --> 28:56.027
Mm, you know your airstrips.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.154
In my line of work, it pays to.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.072
The cat's eye landed here.

29:02.116 --> 29:05.286
Meaning Minerva's plane landed here.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.621
Exactly.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.671
Pennyworth and I will track
Minerva and mask

29:15.755 --> 29:18.215
to the exact location
of the cartel meet.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.468
- You'll keep an eye on our guest?
- Of course.

29:20.801 --> 29:23.471
Better make it two eyes.

29:24.055 --> 29:28.267
I'm famously slippery,
especially when wet.

29:28.935 --> 29:29.935
Excuse me?

29:32.229 --> 29:33.439
I'm going to take a bath.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.734
Ooh. A bubble bath.

29:37.401 --> 29:38.861
Good luck with that one.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.529
Yeah, thanks.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.127
Just us girls left, huh?

29:58.422 --> 30:00.800
Oh. Nice and hot.

30:01.759 --> 30:04.220
- Want to test it?
- Yeah, I'll trust you on that.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.597
Pretty much only on that.

30:06.681 --> 30:10.309
No. Such a suspicious mind.

30:14.981 --> 30:18.275
Now, we'll just give
the bubbles a little time

30:18.359 --> 30:21.237
to work their scented magic.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.114
Meanwhile...

30:28.869 --> 30:32.915
There's a question that
I have been dying to ask you.

30:33.791 --> 30:39.880
Whenever I wear a wig,
I get so hot.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.008
I mean, don't get me wrong,

30:42.091 --> 30:43.801
I love role-playing.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.929
It's a disguise, not role-play.

30:47.013 --> 30:50.808
But on those steamy,
sultry Gotham nights,

30:51.559 --> 30:54.270
I bet you can't wait to...

30:56.105 --> 30:57.898
Take it off.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.609
You know what I mean?

31:01.777 --> 31:02.777
Mm-hmm.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.118
I think the bubbles are
probably ready now.

31:14.415 --> 31:17.251
And it's such a large tub.

31:20.755 --> 31:24.258
I suppose it wouldn't do
any harm if we...

31:25.259 --> 31:27.261
Oh, sorry, Katie.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.391
Cats bathe themselves.

31:32.558 --> 31:36.771
Of course, you're
more than welcome to watch.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.440
If that's how you get your kicks.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.108
No, damn it, I...

31:42.026 --> 31:43.194
I'll be in the cockpit,

31:43.360 --> 31:45.696
monitoring Faraday
and pennyworth's progress.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.452
But don't think for a moment
you can escape this plane.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.288
No, wouldn't dream of it.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.301
Gotta love bat family tech.

32:07.468 --> 32:09.678
Waterproof and bubble-proof.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.475
Holly, it's me. Yeah.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.853
Well, let's just say
I borrowed the phone

32:17.937 --> 32:20.606
while the owner's attention
was elsewhere.

32:22.650 --> 32:24.360
I know, I know, I know,

32:24.443 --> 32:27.738
but the job's taking just
a little bit longer than we planned.

32:28.322 --> 32:29.323
How's Anya?

32:30.950 --> 32:32.034
What about the other girls?

32:34.245 --> 32:35.913
Okay, understood.

32:36.831 --> 32:41.669
But don't worry,
Isis and I will see all of you very soon

32:41.752 --> 32:45.339
with enough scratch,
so they never have to be afraid again.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.048
I promise.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.357
Ladies and gentlemen
of leviathan,

33:03.732 --> 33:06.360
allow me to introduce
prospective member,

33:06.443 --> 33:09.363
Roman sionis, known as black mask.

33:09.697 --> 33:13.409
The reason why he is here
is because his control

33:13.492 --> 33:15.953
of the eastern seaboard cartel
in the states

33:16.579 --> 33:18.247
should make an important addition

33:18.330 --> 33:20.916
to our control of the global undennorld.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.294
And he brought the price of admission.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.638
All in favor
of confirming his candidacy?

33:42.855 --> 33:44.565
Aye.

33:45.608 --> 33:46.734
Opposed?

33:49.403 --> 33:52.823
Oh, look at that. Unanimously confirmed.

33:54.158 --> 33:55.868
Welcome to leviathan, Roman.

33:57.786 --> 34:01.790
I am truly honored
to join this venerable assembly.

34:02.791 --> 34:06.253
- I assume you know everyone.
- Only by reputation.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.715
Forgive me. Then I'm being rude.

34:09.882 --> 34:13.385
This is oyabun noguri,
known of Mr. Yakuza.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.970
Head of the Japanese cartel.

34:16.889 --> 34:17.723
An honor.

34:17.890 --> 34:20.684
The honor is mine, noguri-sama.

34:22.102 --> 34:25.022
Dr. Tzin zhao tzin,
head of the Chinese cartel.

34:25.231 --> 34:28.108
- Doctor.
- Mr. Mask.

34:28.567 --> 34:32.071
At the appropriate time,
I'd love to pick your brain.

34:32.821 --> 34:33.821
About?

34:33.864 --> 34:36.825
I'm sure
we'll think of something.

34:39.203 --> 34:40.037
Also over here,

34:40.204 --> 34:43.040
let me introduce you to amparo cardenas,

34:43.123 --> 34:46.460
known as la dama. Head of
the central American cartel.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.215
Charmed.

34:52.341 --> 34:55.803
Your mask
fascinates me, senor sionis.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.847
It seems at first an affectation,

34:59.014 --> 35:01.642
a nod to the so-called mystery men

35:01.725 --> 35:03.227
who attempt to plague us.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.313
But, I suppose,
we all wear masks of a sort.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.940
Indeed.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.443
I have simply chosen not to hide mine.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.570
I understand.

35:14.071 --> 35:15.990
I believe you and I will enjoy

35:16.073 --> 35:18.742
the fruits of
our shared hemisphere, Roman.

35:18.993 --> 35:21.328
I look fonnard to sharing.

35:30.087 --> 35:32.006
And I believe you know moxie mannheim.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.510
Sure.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.179
Yeah.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.516
Now, now, boys.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.602
Leviathan is one big happy family.

35:45.853 --> 35:48.522
Old conflicts must stay in the past.

35:48.939 --> 35:50.399
You all have your prescribed roles,

35:50.482 --> 35:52.568
your prescribed arenas and territories.

35:52.776 --> 35:55.154
Black mask runs the eastern seaboard.

35:55.237 --> 35:56.780
Boss moxie heads intergang,

35:56.864 --> 35:58.824
leviathan's interstellar arms dealer.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.826
I trust you can both play nice?

36:05.748 --> 36:06.749
- Yeah.
- Sure.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.543
Speaking of territories,

36:10.044 --> 36:14.048
what of our attempt to, uh,
colonize southern Russia?

36:14.214 --> 36:17.009
Yes, ourfailure in sochi

36:17.092 --> 36:19.178
has given each of us...

36:19.636 --> 36:21.597
- Pause?
- Precisely.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.891
Sochi was a setback,

36:23.974 --> 36:25.476
certainly, but I believe

36:25.559 --> 36:27.436
I can quickly allay any concerns.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.754
Holding pattern established.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.948
We could get the call at any minute.

36:40.157 --> 36:41.533
I assume you're ready for action.

36:41.784 --> 36:46.246
Aw, Katie, dear, this kitten's
always ready for action.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.917
All right, selina, enough with
the faux sexual tension.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.796
Honey, there's nothing faux about it.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.214
Come on, cat.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.257
Don't call me cat.

36:57.508 --> 37:01.303
Wait. I can call you selina,
but I can't call you cat?

37:01.637 --> 37:04.348
Which is, in case you hadn't noticed,

37:04.640 --> 37:05.974
short for catwoman.

37:07.351 --> 37:10.312
- Only he calls me cat.
- Oh.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.204
Jp one to flight one.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.775
This is flight one.
Do you have the location?

37:14.983 --> 37:15.818
Roger that.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.278
Kf one just needs time to get
his ducks in a row.

37:18.445 --> 37:21.156
We don't want any of the cartel leaders
to escape our dragnet.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.784
We need a distraction to keep
the bad guys busy and on site.

37:23.992 --> 37:24.993
Sending coordinates.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.037
Okay, distraction. You're up.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.664
Uh, yeah.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.625
I am up. About 1,000 feet up.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.210
When do we land?

37:33.293 --> 37:35.129
We're not landing. There isn't time.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.048
Do you see wings on this feline?

37:38.132 --> 37:39.425
Cats don't fly.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.220
We had a deal.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.764
No, you had a deal.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.641
I was being blackmailed.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.476
Deal, extortion.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.061
Let's not get caught up in semantics.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.797
Approaching drop.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.698
Jump here, orjump into a prison cell

38:02.781 --> 38:04.199
for 20 years to life.

38:04.408 --> 38:06.243
Ugh, fine.

38:06.410 --> 38:07.995
Here. This will help us keep in touch.

38:08.829 --> 38:09.997
Oh, joy.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.583
Try these instead.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.959
I think you'll like 'em.

38:20.757 --> 38:21.800
Drop in ten.

38:26.680 --> 38:32.811
Drop in five, four,
three, two, one, drop.

38:39.485 --> 38:42.112
Flight one to jp one. The cat's away.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.907
- Any problems?
- Uh, she balked a little.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.242
- Only a little?
- Yeah, I know.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.036
Suspicious.

38:51.121 --> 38:54.208
Ha! So maybe cats can fly.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.877
No wonder Superman's such a happy guy.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.545
Flying kinda rocks.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.464
Deploy chute, selina,

39:00.547 --> 39:03.133
before you find out
just how poorly rocks fly.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.552
No! Killjoy.

39:05.677 --> 39:06.678
I've been called worse.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.454
All right,
I'm very glad you're having fun.

39:14.478 --> 39:16.939
Press the button
on the side of the goggles.

39:17.481 --> 39:18.982
I could do that,

39:19.066 --> 39:20.692
but now that I'm out of the plane,

39:20.776 --> 39:22.694
what makes you think
I'm not going to bail on

39:22.778 --> 39:24.279
this whole endeavor?

39:24.655 --> 39:26.114
Well, I have your cat.

39:28.242 --> 39:29.243
Pressing button.

39:32.829 --> 39:36.250
Oh, wow! You were right.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.544
I like the goggles.

39:42.548 --> 39:43.548
Target acquired?

39:44.758 --> 39:46.343
Target acquired.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.109
- You good?
- Please!

40:02.276 --> 40:03.819
A cat always...

40:03.902 --> 40:05.320
Yeah, yeah, lands on her feet.

40:05.404 --> 40:08.282
I've heard the saying. Don't you ever
get tired of all that cat schtick?

40:08.949 --> 40:10.701
Oh, seriously?

40:11.118 --> 40:14.204
Do you really want to get into
a schtick war,

40:14.538 --> 40:16.498
batwoman?

40:17.791 --> 40:18.875
I didn't think so.

40:33.724 --> 40:36.059
Here, kitty, kitty.

40:38.604 --> 40:43.358
Now, what's a nice feline
like you doing in a place like this?

40:44.276 --> 40:46.278
I could ask you
the same question, cheshire.

40:46.445 --> 40:49.031
Uh-uh. I asked first.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.532
I'm a Jewel thief.

40:50.741 --> 40:52.367
I came here to steal the Jewel.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.661
And I am
a league of shadows assassin.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.831
I came here to kill the Jewel thief.

40:58.749 --> 41:00.500
You came here to try.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.544
Catfight?

41:03.337 --> 41:04.546
Catfight.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.485
Oh, come on! Not the face.

41:26.693 --> 41:29.738
That's my moneymaker, or one of them.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.406
Not for long.

41:32.074 --> 41:33.492
Jellyfish toxin.

41:34.201 --> 41:37.287
Yeah. You used that on me last time.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.915
Since then, I made sure
to build up an immunity.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.210
I have got to find
some new toxins.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.381
Mm, I don't know, chesh.

41:47.464 --> 41:50.425
Poison doesn't really fit
the whole cat motif.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.469
I'm expanding the trope!

42:17.285 --> 42:20.205
Nighty-night, kitty.

42:29.673 --> 42:31.007
Batwoman?

42:31.174 --> 42:32.294
Why are you here?

42:33.677 --> 42:35.387
It's not by choice.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.764
Your cat was going berserk on the plane.

42:38.014 --> 42:40.100
You know, she's small,
but she is a monster.

42:42.060 --> 42:46.356
Yeah, Isis is
way too dignified for berserk.

42:46.857 --> 42:48.984
I think she's here
as your back-up.

42:49.276 --> 42:51.570
Oh, is that true?

42:52.070 --> 42:53.780
Are you my back-up?

42:54.197 --> 42:56.074
Maybe.

42:58.368 --> 43:00.787
In any case, it's two against one.

43:02.664 --> 43:03.832
Three against one.

43:06.334 --> 43:07.669
Okay, two against one.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.755
Am I supposed to be impressed?

43:10.672 --> 43:14.009
I mean, it's not called
the league of shadows for nothing.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.192
Uh, who is that?

43:30.358 --> 43:32.778
I am nosferata.

43:33.445 --> 43:34.654
I'm new.

43:35.572 --> 43:38.074
You've got your bat, I've got mine.

43:39.242 --> 43:40.744
- She's not my bat!
- I'm not her bat.

43:42.412 --> 43:45.081
Then I guess you belong to me.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.649
What do you call a bat without wings?

44:11.483 --> 44:12.843
What is this? Are you the riddler?

44:15.403 --> 44:17.405
You call her roadkill.

44:23.453 --> 44:24.663
Hey! What the...

44:24.871 --> 44:27.082
I don't have wings, but yours will do.

44:28.625 --> 44:30.293
Yeah, we'll see about that.

44:43.557 --> 44:45.517
Well, they seem to be getting along.

44:48.061 --> 44:49.271
Well, sure.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.314
Those bats like to pretend
they're loners,

44:51.398 --> 44:53.817
but there's a whole cave
full of them back in Gotham.

44:54.067 --> 44:55.902
I hear you would know.

44:56.069 --> 44:57.779
We're not discussing that.

44:59.990 --> 45:02.617
Oh, touchy subject?

45:02.742 --> 45:04.870
Listen, you grinning idiot.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.414
You really don't want to make me mad.

45:54.878 --> 45:55.958
What was that?

45:58.214 --> 45:59.925
Retribution, perhaps.

46:12.354 --> 46:13.874
Uh-oh.

46:26.117 --> 46:31.414
Let go. You're too heavy.

46:31.539 --> 46:33.124
Uh, rude.

46:33.291 --> 46:37.337
Still, it never hurts
to lose the extra weight.

46:37.754 --> 46:41.549
- Don't do...
- Aw, we're halfway down already.

46:54.729 --> 46:57.607
Still too heavy.

46:59.401 --> 47:00.735
Still so rude.

47:01.111 --> 47:03.130
Hey, we're going to need something
to break our fall.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.198
Oh, what about her?

47:05.949 --> 47:06.992
That'll work.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.960
No!

47:18.461 --> 47:20.046
You're gonna get us all killed.

47:20.380 --> 47:22.674
I'm sure we'll be fine.

47:22.757 --> 47:24.551
And you'll only be badly injured.

47:39.107 --> 47:41.067
- Ow!
- Yeah.

47:43.236 --> 47:44.571
Uh-oh, again.

47:44.654 --> 47:46.531
What now?

48:01.963 --> 48:04.466
See that? We took out
your two assassins,

48:04.591 --> 48:08.053
so you big-talking, behind-the-scenes
deskjockeys might want to run.

48:08.219 --> 48:11.681
It seems to me the marble floor
took out my assassins.

48:14.559 --> 48:17.062
And we have resources of our own.

48:17.854 --> 48:19.939
None of us got here by accident.

48:20.607 --> 48:22.275
Speak for yourself.

48:22.358 --> 48:23.777
I just fell through a skylight.

48:25.945 --> 48:27.065
Kill them both.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.532
Uh, we should...

48:29.616 --> 48:30.616
Way ahead of you.

48:35.872 --> 48:38.666
I meant move away from
the guys with guns,

48:38.833 --> 48:40.001
not toward them.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.252
Not my style.

48:41.336 --> 48:44.130
Okay, fine, but if you die,
do I still get my deal?

48:44.214 --> 48:45.924
Mm, I'm gonna say nope.

48:47.967 --> 48:49.567
Will you shoot her already?

48:49.803 --> 48:51.679
But, boss, number one's in the way.

48:55.642 --> 48:57.560
There. Now he's out of the way.

49:03.191 --> 49:05.401
Shoot those two broads already.

49:30.635 --> 49:33.596
Yes. These should do for a start.

50:02.250 --> 50:05.712
Abaddon serve la dama.

50:05.795 --> 50:08.256
Morax serve la dama.

50:08.882 --> 50:13.261
And la dama appreciates
your service, mis nihos.

50:21.394 --> 50:24.189
I did not sign up forthis.

50:24.564 --> 50:25.648
Did you sign up for this?

50:25.732 --> 50:28.985
- Uh...
- You really have to think about that?

50:29.819 --> 50:32.155
I definitely did not sign up for this.

50:32.405 --> 50:33.781
See? Even he knows.

51:16.574 --> 51:17.617
Out of the way.

51:20.536 --> 51:22.080
Listen to me, gaijin.

51:22.163 --> 51:26.209
You face oyabun noguri, Mr. Yakuza,

51:26.334 --> 51:28.461
trained in the art of the katana

51:28.544 --> 51:32.715
by sensei who studied with
the great lady Shiva.

51:32.840 --> 51:34.801
Prepare to die.

51:34.926 --> 51:37.595
Mm, yeah, that is something.

51:38.012 --> 51:43.184
The only problem is, you face
selina Kyle, the catwoman,

51:43.268 --> 51:48.356
trained in the art of the katana
by the great lady Shiva herself.

51:49.649 --> 51:51.734
- Oh, crap.
- Exactly.

51:51.985 --> 51:53.225
Prepare to get your ass kicked.

51:56.823 --> 51:58.574
Enough!

52:38.781 --> 52:40.658
Nifios, kill her already.

52:41.409 --> 52:43.328
You demons must earn your keep.

52:46.456 --> 52:48.916
Nihos, protect your mistr...

52:53.463 --> 52:56.424
Abaddon not understand.

52:56.966 --> 52:58.926
What's la dama say?

52:59.010 --> 53:01.554
Morax not sure.

53:01.721 --> 53:04.182
She's saying your service is complete.

53:06.142 --> 53:08.061
Now she's saying you should go home.

53:09.354 --> 53:13.566
Abaddon obey la dama.

53:13.900 --> 53:16.611
Morax obey la dama.

53:21.991 --> 53:23.493
That's the problem with demons.

53:23.576 --> 53:25.453
The major ones are too hard to control,

53:25.536 --> 53:27.663
and the minor ones,
They are dumb as bricks.

53:41.969 --> 53:44.806
- That all you got?
- No.

53:55.942 --> 53:58.528
This is where it pays to be flexible.

54:06.744 --> 54:09.163
Bw-1 to jp-1. Eta?

54:09.247 --> 54:10.832
Um, is the distraction working?

54:11.082 --> 54:12.333
Are the bosses still there?

54:14.710 --> 54:16.838
Yes and yes. Eta?

54:17.046 --> 54:18.131
Perfect, bw—1.

54:18.297 --> 54:20.716
Was worried the bosses
might have gotten ailurophobia.

54:21.759 --> 54:24.095
- What?
- You know, fear of cats.

54:24.429 --> 54:26.556
Didn't want distraction
to scare them off.

54:26.639 --> 54:28.307
Mm. Yeah. No worries there.

54:30.518 --> 54:34.439
It took kf-1 a tad longer than
we'd hoped to get his ducks in a row.

54:37.525 --> 54:39.485
Julia. Damn it. Eta?

54:41.446 --> 54:43.364
Now. Just... eta, now.

54:43.448 --> 54:44.991
Let's go, let's go!

54:45.408 --> 54:48.161
Ducks all in a row here.

54:57.086 --> 54:58.212
Open fire!

55:22.111 --> 55:24.864
Hey, boss. I can't move!

55:24.947 --> 55:26.574
Well, I got my own problems.

55:34.582 --> 55:37.001
Yeah, you better hide, you lousy cop.

55:42.757 --> 55:44.759
Actually, I'm quite an impressive cop,

55:44.926 --> 55:48.054
as you would certainly know
if you were still conscious.

55:52.558 --> 55:53.559
Damn.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.311
Just let me out of this tin can,

55:55.394 --> 55:57.730
I'll show you what
a real crackdown looks like.

55:58.356 --> 56:00.358
Let me out!

56:01.025 --> 56:03.194
It seems we need a little more help.

56:03.277 --> 56:05.905
Touch a single test tube
and you're toast, tzin.

56:06.739 --> 56:08.991
Hands in the air, doctor.

56:09.951 --> 56:11.744
Disappointing development.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.790
Hmm. Learn to cope.

56:23.047 --> 56:25.758
Oh, come on, whale. Seriously?

56:30.471 --> 56:31.471
Gonna_.

56:31.806 --> 56:33.432
Kill you!

56:34.559 --> 56:36.561
Don't make me fight dirty.

56:43.859 --> 56:44.859
Timber.

56:48.447 --> 56:49.447
Huh.

56:49.532 --> 56:51.826
One whale beached.

57:13.097 --> 57:13.973
Nice work.

57:14.056 --> 57:18.394
Yeah, but has anyone seen
lady Minerva?

57:18.894 --> 57:21.606
Oh, now you're here.

57:23.983 --> 57:25.443
I believe we had a deal.

57:25.985 --> 57:27.778
I thought you said it was extortion.

57:27.862 --> 57:29.113
No, no, now.

57:29.196 --> 57:31.365
Let's not get caught up in semantics.

57:31.657 --> 57:33.242
Minerva's still out there.

57:33.534 --> 57:36.996
No, I was just the distraction.

57:37.496 --> 57:39.832
Cordoning off the place
was your job, king.

57:39.915 --> 57:40.915
All right.

57:41.459 --> 57:43.294
You did your part, selina.

57:43.502 --> 57:44.502
You're free to go.

57:44.837 --> 57:46.964
All charges and warrants
will be dropped.

57:47.340 --> 57:48.674
It's a clean slate.

57:49.091 --> 57:50.426
So, stay out of trouble.

57:54.138 --> 57:55.723
Oh, don't you start.

57:56.766 --> 57:59.477
So, since the job's over,

57:59.644 --> 58:02.313
can I have the emerald back now?

58:02.563 --> 58:03.563
No.

58:14.617 --> 58:16.827
Not exactly the cat's eye.

58:17.203 --> 58:19.789
But this pretty will do for now.

58:20.456 --> 58:21.456
Right.

58:23.542 --> 58:26.128
Every little bit helps
Anya and the other girls.

58:26.879 --> 58:28.923
Now, if I could just
get leviathan to quit

58:29.006 --> 58:31.092
sending league of shadows assassins
to kill us.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.311
Well, well.

58:44.230 --> 58:48.067
You know, Isis, cheshire's sword
really has come in handy.

58:48.484 --> 58:50.861
We must remember to thank her
next time we see her.

58:51.487 --> 58:53.698
Assuming she's not still
trying to murder us.

58:57.118 --> 58:58.119
Oh, come on.

58:58.285 --> 58:59.578
Overkill much?

58:59.745 --> 59:01.831
I mean, there are like 100 of you here.

59:02.623 --> 59:03.499
Fifty-two.

59:03.624 --> 59:06.752
Bat-computer in my cowl counts
52 ninja on this tower.

59:07.169 --> 59:11.215
Oh, darn, I was only prepared for 51.

59:11.549 --> 59:12.925
Can you handle the extra?

59:13.384 --> 59:15.302
Please, I'm so getting more than you.

59:20.683 --> 59:22.268
One, two.

59:22.685 --> 59:24.729
So why you here? Three.

59:26.147 --> 59:27.022
One.

59:27.106 --> 59:28.899
I had a feeling this wasn't over. Two.

59:28.983 --> 59:30.526
Minerva's not known for forgiveness.

59:30.609 --> 59:31.609
Three.

59:33.070 --> 59:33.946
Four.

59:34.029 --> 59:35.990
Oh, why won't you just admit? Five!

59:36.657 --> 59:39.368
Six! That you find me irresistible.

59:40.244 --> 59:41.537
Irresistible?

59:41.620 --> 59:42.538
Come on.

59:42.621 --> 59:44.623
Four. Why won't you just admit... five.

59:44.832 --> 59:46.375
But personalities aside... six.

59:46.459 --> 59:48.085
I have a responsibility... seven.

59:48.169 --> 59:49.795
To make sure you survive. Eight.

59:49.962 --> 59:52.131
Oh. At least I have a personality.

59:52.506 --> 59:53.382
Seven, eight.

59:53.507 --> 59:54.508
Nine. Ten.

59:55.176 --> 59:56.302
You're falling behind.

59:56.635 --> 59:57.887
Eleven.

1:00:00.306 --> 1:00:02.141
Nine, ten.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:03.350
Eleven.

1:00:05.269 --> 1:00:07.730
Twelve, 13, 14.

1:00:09.231 --> 1:00:10.691
You'll never beat me at this rate.

1:00:10.775 --> 1:00:12.276
Fifteen.

1:00:12.359 --> 1:00:13.819
Twelve.

1:00:13.903 --> 1:00:14.903
Thirteen.

1:00:15.488 --> 1:00:16.655
Fourteen.

1:00:17.698 --> 1:00:18.698
Fifteen.

1:00:25.164 --> 1:00:26.499
He's mine!

1:00:30.836 --> 1:00:32.213
Sixteen.

1:00:34.006 --> 1:00:38.302
Ah, final count. Batwoman: 25.

1:00:38.677 --> 1:00:40.387
Catwoman: 27.

1:00:40.721 --> 1:00:42.014
Iwin.

1:00:42.473 --> 1:00:43.641
Oh, come on.

1:00:43.724 --> 1:00:46.143
Seriously? Isis took out two of yours,

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:47.770
so, technically, it's a tie.

1:00:48.854 --> 1:00:50.439
My cat, my count.

1:00:56.821 --> 1:00:58.447
I don't want to say I told you so,

1:00:58.531 --> 1:01:02.243
but I believe I told you
52 would not be enough.

1:01:02.827 --> 1:01:06.497
My friend, they simply
do not make ninja like they used to.

1:01:08.123 --> 1:01:09.124
Deliver the package.

1:01:19.385 --> 1:01:20.678
You clearly cheated.

1:01:20.928 --> 1:01:24.014
Just because you don't have
a cat of your own to help fight.

1:01:31.647 --> 1:01:34.108
Solomon grundy.

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:36.819
Born on a Monday.

1:01:37.820 --> 1:01:39.613
Oh, come on.

1:01:40.030 --> 1:01:42.700
Christened on Tuesday.

1:01:43.951 --> 1:01:46.871
Married on Wednesday.

1:01:49.623 --> 1:01:52.084
Wow. That's one fair-weather cat.

1:01:52.209 --> 1:01:54.211
Meaning she's smarter than we are?

1:01:54.628 --> 1:01:56.171
Yeah, pretty much.

1:01:56.755 --> 1:01:59.466
Died on Saturday.

1:02:00.301 --> 1:02:02.970
Buried on Sunday.

1:02:04.555 --> 1:02:10.102
And that was the end of Solomon grundy.

1:02:15.316 --> 1:02:17.610
-Born on a Monday. {933931

1:02:18.402 --> 1:02:21.447
christened on Tuesday.

1:02:21.530 --> 1:02:24.742
Married on Wednesday.

1:02:26.327 --> 1:02:28.245
Oh, sorry, sol.

1:02:28.329 --> 1:02:29.580
You got the wrong bride.

1:02:39.214 --> 1:02:41.926
Died on Saturday.

1:02:46.221 --> 1:02:49.141
Buried on Sunday.

1:02:49.350 --> 1:02:55.397
And that was the end of Solomon grundy.

1:02:56.231 --> 1:02:57.231
If only.

1:02:57.566 --> 1:02:59.568
Come on, sol baby.

1:02:59.652 --> 1:03:02.196
I'm the one they sent you to pulverize.

1:03:02.321 --> 1:03:03.530
Follow me.

1:03:03.614 --> 1:03:06.492
Solomon grundy.

1:03:06.659 --> 1:03:09.662
Born on a Monday.

1:03:09.787 --> 1:03:11.747
Yes, that's it.

1:03:12.122 --> 1:03:13.165
That's it.

1:03:13.499 --> 1:03:14.667
Right this way.

1:03:14.875 --> 1:03:16.168
There you go.

1:03:16.877 --> 1:03:20.047
Christened on Tuesday.

1:03:28.389 --> 1:03:31.433
Died on Saturday.

1:03:32.309 --> 1:03:33.435
Uh. Look...

1:03:33.519 --> 1:03:35.980
I promised a certain someone
that I wouldn't kill

1:03:36.063 --> 1:03:39.358
or not be the direct cause
of death anyway.

1:03:39.817 --> 1:03:42.987
But the truly special thing
aboutyouis_.

1:03:43.445 --> 1:03:45.489
You never permanently kick the bucket.

1:03:45.614 --> 1:03:48.492
Solomon grundy.

1:03:48.701 --> 1:03:50.327
- Born on a Monday.
- Yeah, exactly.

1:03:50.411 --> 1:03:52.037
Come Monday, you'll just regenerate.

1:03:52.204 --> 1:03:54.540
So, when it comes to my promise...

1:03:55.249 --> 1:03:56.500
All bets are off.

1:03:56.709 --> 1:04:00.170
Married on Wednesday.

1:04:00.504 --> 1:04:03.632
Oh. You're getting married?
Congratulations.

1:04:03.757 --> 1:04:05.009
Here. Have a cigar.

1:04:05.759 --> 1:04:07.886
Took ill on...

1:04:08.721 --> 1:04:09.930
Or have a dozen.

1:04:15.144 --> 1:04:16.770
That's all, folks.

1:04:35.330 --> 1:04:36.415
You know what they say.

1:04:36.540 --> 1:04:39.043
The bigger they are... etcetera.

1:04:41.295 --> 1:04:45.257
If you want something
done right, etcetera, etcetera.

1:04:49.762 --> 1:04:52.890
Careful. That kitty has claws.

1:05:00.064 --> 1:05:01.732
So does this one.

1:05:22.377 --> 1:05:25.297
Okay. Did not know you could do that.

1:05:25.672 --> 1:05:26.840
Yes.

1:05:26.924 --> 1:05:30.385
It came as quite a shock
to wonder woman as well.

1:05:31.053 --> 1:05:33.764
But neither of you
should have been surprised.

1:05:33.972 --> 1:05:36.058
I Rose to lead leviathan

1:05:36.141 --> 1:05:39.144
by serving the gods of both my parents.

1:05:39.394 --> 1:05:41.897
My father's god was
always money, of course.

1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:44.108
My mother's god was urzkartaga.

1:05:44.274 --> 1:05:47.903
Becoming the cheetah
is urzkartaga's answer to my prayers.

1:05:48.278 --> 1:05:49.822
Uh, right.

1:05:49.905 --> 1:05:52.658
I have a similar deal with, um...

1:05:53.325 --> 1:05:55.369
Bastet, Egyptian goddess.

1:05:55.619 --> 1:05:59.289
Turns me into a literal catwoman
all the time.

1:05:59.456 --> 1:06:01.333
Yeah. How do you think I got the name?

1:06:01.458 --> 1:06:02.793
You were a cat burglar

1:06:02.918 --> 1:06:06.130
who started wearing a mask
with cute little kitten ears.

1:06:06.713 --> 1:06:07.756
Yeah.

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:09.383
They are pretty cute, aren't they?

1:06:09.591 --> 1:06:13.053
Listen, that transformation
of yours seemed really painful.

1:06:13.137 --> 1:06:15.472
And, honestly, I'm pretty exhausted
just from watching it.

1:06:15.556 --> 1:06:18.392
How about we put this off
until, oh, I don't know...

1:06:18.767 --> 1:06:19.810
Bastille day?

1:06:19.893 --> 1:06:21.103
Bastille day work for you?

1:06:21.770 --> 1:06:23.814
My schedule is clear now.

1:06:24.106 --> 1:06:25.357
Oh!

1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:26.440
Cat fight?

1:06:26.775 --> 1:06:28.360
Big cat fight.

1:10:45.742 --> 1:10:47.327
Oh, by the way,

1:10:47.411 --> 1:10:50.497
your little problem in sochi,
that was me.

1:10:50.664 --> 1:10:51.665
You're welcome.

1:11:39.713 --> 1:11:40.713
Selina.

1:11:41.756 --> 1:11:43.800
Nice catch, bat.

1:11:45.802 --> 1:11:46.802
No problem.

1:12:11.786 --> 1:12:13.330
Well,

1:12:13.413 --> 1:12:16.291
I suppose a leviathan
will need a new proxy.

1:12:16.958 --> 1:12:21.880
If Talia al ghul is to continue
leading from the shadows.

1:12:22.297 --> 1:12:23.423
But I must say,

1:12:23.715 --> 1:12:27.594
this gives me yet another reason
to hate selina Kyle.

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:30.764
As if! Hadn't enough reasons already.

1:12:34.226 --> 1:12:35.685
Inhibitor collar set.

1:12:40.607 --> 1:12:41.483
Hey, hold up.

1:12:41.566 --> 1:12:43.193
Got to put a collar on grundy.

1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:45.695
How? The guy's got no neck.

1:12:47.614 --> 1:12:48.657
Well, it's over.

1:12:48.782 --> 1:12:51.493
Leviathan and its cartels
have been decimated.

1:12:52.118 --> 1:12:54.138
- And now their leader...
- Please.

1:12:54.162 --> 1:12:57.916
You don't really think cheetah was
the true leader of leviathan, do you?

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:00.752
Hold still.

1:13:00.835 --> 1:13:02.170
You're enjoying this.

1:13:02.254 --> 1:13:03.547
Less than you think.

1:13:04.464 --> 1:13:06.464
- But more than I should.
- Hold on.

1:13:06.883 --> 1:13:09.553
If Minerva wasn't
leviathan's leader, who is?

1:13:09.678 --> 1:13:11.388
Um... I don't know.

1:13:11.513 --> 1:13:13.515
Maybe someone
with international resources

1:13:13.598 --> 1:13:16.017
who's been trained from birth
to rule the undenlvorld?

1:13:16.268 --> 1:13:19.062
- Harley Quinn.
- I'm out of here.

1:13:19.145 --> 1:13:20.855
All right, selina, you can go.

1:13:21.606 --> 1:13:23.191
And, hey, thank you.

1:13:23.275 --> 1:13:25.475
Turns out it was our lucky break
you stole that emerald.

1:13:25.944 --> 1:13:27.612
Luck?

1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:30.115
You believe this was all dumb luck?

1:13:31.241 --> 1:13:33.535
What makes you think
this wasn't my plan all along?

1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:35.120
Yeah, right.

1:13:35.245 --> 1:13:38.540
Since when does catwoman care
about taking down criminals?

1:13:39.457 --> 1:13:42.877
Minerva was trafficking human beings,

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:45.171
young girls.

1:13:52.178 --> 1:13:55.265
Batwoman. Faraday.
The safe in penguin's plane...

1:13:55.432 --> 1:13:57.309
It's empty.
The cat's eye emerald is gone.

1:13:59.227 --> 1:14:00.437
How did she...

1:14:00.854 --> 1:14:02.439
I have no idea.

1:14:03.315 --> 1:14:05.692
Um, where's catwoman?

1:14:11.615 --> 1:14:13.992
Luck, my perfect ass.

1:14:14.659 --> 1:14:18.246
Mad skills, baby.
Planning and mad skills.

1:14:19.623 --> 1:14:21.458
Isis.

1:14:21.625 --> 1:14:23.168
You shouldn't wander off like that.

1:14:23.418 --> 1:14:26.588
Or do you want to be quarantined
for months after we make landfall?

1:14:30.342 --> 1:14:32.010
Hi, Holly. How's Anya?

1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:34.721
Well, don't worry.

1:14:35.430 --> 1:14:38.808
We have all the money we need
to get Anya the help she'll need.

1:14:39.309 --> 1:14:42.270
Help for Anya, and help
for all the women and girls

1:14:42.354 --> 1:14:44.272
leviathan was trafficking in sochi.

1:14:46.691 --> 1:14:48.818
Back to Gotham? Soon.

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:50.152
Soon.

1:14:50.403 --> 1:14:52.322
I just have to make
a quick stop in London.

1:14:52.739 --> 1:14:54.616
There are a few things
I need to pick up,

1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:57.702
you know, at the tower.
