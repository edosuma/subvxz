WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:06.966
Tell me, Lynne, you under the influence
of drugs right now?

00:07.049 --> 00:09.301
You all were handing out
oxys like candy,

00:09.385 --> 00:10.594
and now I'm left
to fend for myself.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.263
But I want to help you now.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.598
35–year–old female.
Looks like an OD.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.726
Let's go. Clear.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.602
Come on, Lynne.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.938
I'm sorry.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.233
You and I agreed
what happened was a mistake.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.943
I have to tell Ethan.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.405
April Sexton,
will you marry me?

00:29.488 --> 00:31.574
I don't think
I can have kids.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.993
Look, I love you
no matter what.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.077
Yes.

00:35.161 --> 00:36.454
(CHUCKLES)

00:43.961 --> 00:45.337
From the looks of that rock,

00:45.421 --> 00:46.964
I'm guessing
you didn't tell Ethan.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.258
No, I didn't,

00:49.341 --> 00:50.968
and I would appreciate it
if you didn't mention it again.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.636
Mention what?

00:57.892 --> 00:59.268
Morning, Mags.

01:01.187 --> 01:02.521
Big plans tonight?

01:04.190 --> 01:05.816
I'm actually going
before the board today.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.986
- Uh–oh. What'd you do now?
- Funny.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.237
I'm proposing opening

01:10.321 --> 01:11.781
a safe injection site
at the hospital.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.700
- Safe injection of what?
- Drugs.

01:14.784 --> 01:17.119
People will be
allowed to use,

01:17.203 --> 01:18.537
but with medical staff on hand

01:18.621 --> 01:20.873
to resuscitate should
anyone overdose.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.917
This because of that patient
you lost last week?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.252
- Lynne.
- Mmm–hmm.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.338
She should not have died.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.548
She had a kid, Maggie.
Now he's an orphan.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.467
But that's not your fault.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.010
I gave her the pills.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.637
Her addiction
started with me.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.182
How many other people
did I do this to?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.308
(PAGER BEEPS)

01:39.391 --> 01:40.392
I gotta take this.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.937
Listen, everyone,

01:43.020 --> 01:44.939
there was an accident
at O'Hare.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.274
They're routing victims
to us and East Mercy.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.567
Any word on what happened?

01:48.651 --> 01:50.277
An electrical fire
in the cabin.

01:50.361 --> 01:52.154
Our first victim
is coming in now.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.989
Marcel, you're with Dr. Choi.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.617
We're going to Baghdad.
Desmond?

01:56.700 --> 01:57.952
Male, age unknown,

01:58.035 --> 01:59.203
was seated in the front
of the plane

01:59.286 --> 02:00.746
where the fire started.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.957
55% TBSA.
Full–thickness burns.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.835
GCS 3. BP 70 over 45.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.754
Blunt trauma and suspected C–spine injury.
Couldn't get a line in.

02:08.838 --> 02:09.839
You know his name?

02:09.922 --> 02:12.341
Working on it.
Airline gave us a manifest.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.718
We're identifying victims
based on seat assignments.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.470
Okay, let's transfer him
on my count.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.932
Everybody ready?
One, two, three.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.017
Cross table, C–spine,
chest and pelvic X–ray.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.102
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.104
No place to get an IV
in the arms.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.939
Okay, give me an IO drill.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.399
Breath sounds bilaterally.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.901
Okay, victim's name
is Samuel Abrams.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.238
What?

02:34.321 --> 02:35.656
No, it's just

02:35.739 --> 02:37.449
our head of neurosurgery
is Sam Abrams, but...

02:37.533 --> 02:40.035
There's got to be a dozen
Sam Abrams in Chicago.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.246
Wait, but I do think that Sam
was traveling somewhere, though.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.622
Do you know where
the plane was coming from?

02:43.706 --> 02:46.333
Uh... Honolulu.
Flight 3376.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.882
Dr. Charles, do you know where
Sam was traveling to?

02:52.965 --> 02:57.428
Um... Neurosurgery
conference in Honolulu.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.971
Coming back today, I think.

02:59.054 --> 03:02.600
Mags, see if anyone in neurosurgery
knows what return flight he was on.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.935
- Already on it.
- Why? What's going on?

03:05.019 --> 03:06.979
MIKE: X–ray. Clear.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.398
- This could be Dr. Abrams.
- What?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.818
See if you can
reach him on his cell.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.445
C4 on 5 subluxation.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.155
Could be
a catastrophic injury.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.034
Straight to voicemail.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.663
Sam was on flight 3376.

03:40.888 --> 03:41.931
I'm all out of rooms.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.807
You're gonna have to
double up in Trauma 2.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.268
- Need some help outside.
- Another victim from O'Hare?

03:46.352 --> 03:48.395
Yep, Layla Bistarkey, 36,
in premature labor.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.190
Heavy vaginal bleeding.
Suspect she abrupted on impact.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.609
Maggie, call up to labor and delivery.
Have them open up an OR.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.277
No time.
She's already crowning.

03:55.361 --> 03:56.528
Dr. Sexton, April,
you go and help.

03:56.612 --> 03:57.613
Yup.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.448
(GASPS)

03:59.531 --> 04:00.991
- She have any burns?
- No.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.202
She and her husband were in the back
of the plane, evacuated first.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.703
Fire never reached them.

04:04.787 --> 04:05.829
PATRICK: I'm here. I'm here.
- Patrick...

04:05.913 --> 04:07.665
PATRICK: Just breathe.
(WHIMPERING) Patrick...

04:07.748 --> 04:08.749
Heart tone's 140.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.125
She isn't due for
another four weeks.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.502
This is our last embryo.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.672
So, please don't...
Oh, God. (GASPS)

04:14.755 --> 04:15.756
I can see the baby's head.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.675
- Heart rate is dropping.
- We gotta do this here.

04:17.758 --> 04:18.968
PATRICK: You're okay.
- Layla...

04:19.051 --> 04:20.260
We've got to get
your baby out right now.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.804
I need you to push
with all your might.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.472
(STAMMERS)
- Now, Layla.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.557
Layla, bear down. Push.

04:25.641 --> 04:26.767
(INHALES SHARPLY)

04:26.850 --> 04:28.936
APRIL: Yes!
Come on! Push!

04:29.019 --> 04:31.772
(SCREAMING)

04:31.855 --> 04:33.232
That's it. You're almost there.
Keep going.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.693
- A little more.
APRIL: Breathe him out.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.238
APRIL: Yes! Yes.
PATRICK: Oh, my God. It's okay.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.364
(PANTING) Oh!

04:40.447 --> 04:41.949
WILL: You did it.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.575
LAYLA: Baby.
PATRICK: Here, all good.

04:43.659 --> 04:44.868
Baby.
(LAUGHS)

04:44.952 --> 04:46.912
(BABY CRYING)

04:48.914 --> 04:50.541
Hi, my love.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.834
Oh! Shh.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.804
I know.
Yes, yes. I know.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.473
Just tell them
we'll start in 15 minutes.

05:06.557 --> 05:07.766
Yes.

05:07.850 --> 05:12.563
And move my 3:00.
Move it to 4:30.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.689
Yes...

05:13.772 --> 05:15.274
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

05:15.357 --> 05:16.900
Look, I gotta go.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.282
Hey. Have you heard?

05:23.365 --> 05:24.450
GARRETT: No. What?

05:24.533 --> 05:26.452
There was a plane crash
at O'Hare.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.037
Oh, no. No, I...

05:28.120 --> 05:29.955
I've been tied up.
How many victims?

05:30.039 --> 05:31.832
Well, I haven't gotten
a headcount yet.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.000
Oh, goodness.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.293
I'll keep you posted.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.297
Oh, wait. This proposal
from Dr. Halstead?

05:38.380 --> 05:39.798
Yeah.
A safe injection site?

05:39.882 --> 05:44.094
Well, there are already facilities
like that overseas and in Canada.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.472
Yeah, none in the U.S...
Not above–board.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.141
Well, the judge in
Philadelphia just ruled

05:49.224 --> 05:52.519
that a proposed site there
doesn't violate federal law.

05:52.603 --> 05:53.812
Sharon,
the legal battles alone

05:53.896 --> 05:55.189
would cost this hospital
a fortune.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.484
Yeah, but preventing deaths
would save the hospital money

05:58.567 --> 06:00.527
in the long run,
not to mention the PR value

06:00.611 --> 06:02.571
of being
the first hospital...

06:02.654 --> 06:04.239
To allow drug use
on our premises?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.535
"A PR nightmare"
is how I'd put it.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.581
- Sharon.
- Yes.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.335
Sam Abrams was on that plane
that crashed today.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.669
Oh, no.

06:17.753 --> 06:18.796
He survive?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.672
He did.

06:20.756 --> 06:24.551
But he's severely burned
and in very bad shape.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.678
Okay. Thanks, Daniel.

06:29.515 --> 06:32.768
LAYLA: We did four
rounds of IVF.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.604
I can't believe it.
Is she really here?

06:35.687 --> 06:37.147
She's really here.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.484
Gosh, let me see this.
Yeah.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.986
Where in the world
did this red hair come from?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.404
Don't look at me.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.032
Every Bistarkey since the Stone Age
has been brunette.

06:47.116 --> 06:48.659
As the only ginger
in my family,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.036
I can tell you the redheaded
gene is recessive.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.123
So it's possible
it just hasn't expressed until now.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.415
Noah.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.000
Do her hands look
a little blue to you?

07:00.337 --> 07:03.173
Layla, I just need to take
a quick look at something.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.134
Okay. (GASPS)
Who's this?

07:05.217 --> 07:07.052
Who's this guy?

07:07.136 --> 07:08.512
Who's that?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.598
Chest is mottled.
Feet are blue.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.517
- Why is she breathing so hard?
- Give her to me.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.601
Okay.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.230
She's retracting.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.940
I'm gonna try to clear out
more secretions.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.861
(BABY FUSSING)

07:23.944 --> 07:25.362
(BABY COUGHS)

07:26.488 --> 07:28.115
Still struggling.
Blow–by with Ambu bag.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.616
LAYLA: Is she okay?
What's wrong with her?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.368
Transfer her to the NICU.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.703
Wait.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.663
Don't worry. We're gonna
figure out what's going on.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.540
(BABY CRYING)

07:40.043 --> 07:41.712
Where are they
taking my girl?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.214
This...

07:44.298 --> 07:46.258
Can't be my Sam.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.303
Are you sure?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.681
Paramedics used the flight manifest
to identify Sam by his seat number.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.058
I don't know.
Maybe he switched seats with someone.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.269
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:57.352 --> 07:59.438
We recovered this
from his pocket.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.567
(CRYING) Honey...

08:05.360 --> 08:07.654
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.489
(KNOCKING)

08:10.741 --> 08:12.075
ETHAN: You must be Lucy.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.328
I'm Dr. Choi.
Your father's a friend.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.039
What... No,
I'm not Sam's daughter.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.625
I'm... I'm sorry.

08:19.708 --> 08:23.045
This is Sam's wife, Michelle.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.297
Lucy's backpacking in
South America right now

08:25.380 --> 08:27.299
and I haven't been able
to reach her yet.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.844
My apologies.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.262
They're ready for
Dr. Abrams in CT.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.681
- Okay.
- Can I go with him?

08:34.765 --> 08:36.475
Of course.
I'll take you up.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.948
Hey, Maggie.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.325
- Hey.
- How's Dr. Abrams doing?

08:53.408 --> 08:54.701
He went up to CT.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.036
We'll know more after
we see his scans.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.288
(SIGHS)
I can't believe it.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.582
So...

09:00.666 --> 09:03.794
Couldn't help but notice your tête–à–tête
with Crockett this morning.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.047
Looked a little tense.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.590
It was nothing.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.467
You sure?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.011
- I'm sure.
- Good.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.639
Great news about
you and Ethan.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.224
Thanks.

09:18.392 --> 09:22.354
All I want is to marry him
and forget this ever happened.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.402
So Mazie has
a genetic condition.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.780
Surfactant protein
deficiency. SP–B.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.949
It's a kind of
interstitial lung disease.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.492
"Interstitial"?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.244
It means the scarring
of the lungs,

09:37.327 --> 09:38.537
making it difficult
to breathe.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.165
So what do we have to do?
Does she have to go on medication or...

09:42.249 --> 09:44.960
No. Unfortunately, the only
effective treatment option

09:45.043 --> 09:47.045
is a lung transplant.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.422
- Oh, my God.
- Now?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.632
But she's so little.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.844
I don't understand. Her embryo
was tested for genetic disorders

09:53.927 --> 09:55.429
prior to implantation.

09:55.512 --> 09:59.474
It's possible that this was missed
or wasn't even included in the testing.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.476
- It's a very rare condition.
- Yeah.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.187
How will she get a lung
that's small enough?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.233
Does another baby have to...
Have to die first?

10:08.317 --> 10:10.610
Well, there's also
a living–donor option.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.114
The lower lobes of a lung from
two donors are transplanted.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.408
If you're matches,
you both can donate.

10:17.868 --> 10:21.121
You should know,
it is a major surgery,

10:21.204 --> 10:23.540
followed by four to six
weeks of recovery.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.667
(SOBBING)

10:26.710 --> 10:29.671
- But of course we'll do it.
- Yeah, anything Mazie needs.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.798
Okay, we'll get you both
tested right away.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.186
Oh, God.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.821
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

10:54.905 --> 10:57.032
Trini, come quick!

10:57.115 --> 10:58.617
What's going on?

10:58.700 --> 11:00.118
There's a baby in
the back of the car.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.453
- Is he breathing?
- I don't know.

11:01.536 --> 11:05.916
- Stand back.
(CAR ALARM BLARING)

11:11.630 --> 11:13.673
He's breathing shallow
and he's unresponsive.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.509
You're okay.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.094
You're okay. Come here.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.679
Okay. Let's go.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.309
Get warming blankets
and start an IV.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.560
You got it.

11:25.644 --> 11:26.812
Trini, get a core temp.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.108
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.484
Wake up.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.944
Core temp's 94.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.445
He's hypothermic.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.490
All right, let's bolus
10ccs per kilo of warm...

11:39.533 --> 11:41.952
Shh. You're okay.
You're okay.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.746
I'm working with security
to locate the parents.

11:44.830 --> 11:45.872
Where was the car parked?

11:45.956 --> 11:48.125
Third floor of the parking
structure, south end.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.918
That's administrative parking.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.170
Do either of you remember
the color or make?

11:52.254 --> 11:54.131
Dark gray BMW.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.217
Do you know it?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.344
That's Gwen Garrett's car.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.563
(MONITOR BEEPING)

12:20.323 --> 12:21.950
His name is Devon, right?

12:22.784 --> 12:24.119
Yes. Devon.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.248
What is he,
about seven months?

12:28.331 --> 12:30.041
Eight.

12:34.838 --> 12:40.510
You know, when my son Michael
was about six years old,

12:40.594 --> 12:44.556
I took him school shopping
with his baby sister Tara.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.932
(CHUCKLES)

12:46.016 --> 12:50.812
And Tara was throwing
some kind of fit

12:50.896 --> 12:57.652
about these red, sparkly
Mary Janes.

12:57.736 --> 13:03.158
And I turned away from
Michael for a second

13:03.241 --> 13:05.160
and when I looked back,

13:06.870 --> 13:08.455
he was gone.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.711
And I remember how sick
I felt at that moment.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.630
Where was he?

13:16.713 --> 13:19.424
Hiding under a clothes rack.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.134
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

13:23.720 --> 13:24.888
Anyway...

13:26.139 --> 13:28.266
I know how hard
it can be sometimes

13:28.350 --> 13:31.019
just managing as a mother.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.564
My husband, Mark...

13:34.648 --> 13:39.069
(SNIFFLES) Excuse me...
My soon–to–be ex–husband,

13:39.152 --> 13:42.280
he usually drops Devon off
at daycare on Wednesdays,

13:42.364 --> 13:45.325
but we switched schedules
this week.

13:45.408 --> 13:49.079
I'm sorry, I didn't know you
were going through a divorce.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.372
(SCOFFS)

13:51.706 --> 13:56.169
Well, it's turning into a contentious
custody battle,

13:56.253 --> 13:57.337
unfortunately.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.632
Well, you're obviously
juggling a lot.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.510
I totally forgot
that I had him with me.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.473
I should have double–checked
the back seat. (SOBS)

14:08.557 --> 14:11.351
Yes, that's true.

14:13.103 --> 14:16.481
You were very lucky
this time, Gwen.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.528
And I'm sure you won't
make that mistake again.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.405
No, I won't.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.912
Thank you, Sharon.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.259
(SNIFFLES)

14:45.969 --> 14:47.596
MICHELLE: Oh, my God.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.973
Um...

14:50.056 --> 14:54.769
Wait. You're saying
he'll never walk again?

14:54.853 --> 14:59.024
He'll... He'll never be able
to use his hands again?

14:59.107 --> 15:00.734
I'm very sorry.

15:00.817 --> 15:04.988
But we are optimistic Sam will wake up
once the swelling in his brain goes down.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.782
And, um...

15:07.866 --> 15:09.326
He'll be able to talk to me?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.995
We're hopeful
he'll be able to communicate.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.788
Scans showed no major
brain injury.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.292
MICHELLE:
And what about feeding

15:17.375 --> 15:19.878
and dressing himself and...

15:23.173 --> 15:26.176
He'll be dependent
on others for that.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.887
(GASPS) For how long?

15:28.970 --> 15:30.889
The rest of his life.

15:33.516 --> 15:37.187
Sam and I were supposed
to go to Italy next month.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.024
I'm sorry, I just...

15:41.107 --> 15:43.234
I'll be right back.
I just need a minute.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.655
Oh, man.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.490
A lot to put on
a young woman's shoulders.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.741
Yeah.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.500
- Looking sharp, Dr. Halstead.
- Yeah.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.710
Okay, so I gotta go
practice this presentation.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.337
You're still cool to handle
the Bistarkey case?

16:02.420 --> 16:05.215
Oh, yeah, just waiting on Layla
and Patrick's test results.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.633
- Just keep me posted.
- Will do.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.010
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:09.094 --> 16:12.097
- How they holding up?
- Not so great. They're worried sick.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.142
The Bistarkeys' labs
just came back.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.310
Oh. Thank you.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.271
Dad isn't a match.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.898
- Mmm.
- But Mom is.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.233
Well, that's a start.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.153
- Hold on, um...
- What?

16:32.617 --> 16:36.621
So, the good news is
Layla is a donor match.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.748
I am?
Oh, thank God.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.001
But Patrick,
unfortunately, is not.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.795
It's okay.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.840
Okay, well, still,
we're halfway there, right?

16:46.923 --> 16:48.425
What's next?
What do we need to do?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.885
Does Mazie's second donor
have to be blood–related?

16:50.969 --> 16:54.305
Not necessarily and we'll definitely
go over the next steps

16:54.389 --> 16:56.641
for getting Mazie onto
the transplant list,

16:56.725 --> 16:58.727
but, um, before we do...

16:59.769 --> 17:01.938
Patrick, there are
a few documents

17:02.021 --> 17:04.107
you still need to sign,
if you wouldn't mind following me.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.276
Documents? I mean,
can't that wait?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.153
Technically, they should've
already been taken care of...

17:08.236 --> 17:10.864
Whoa. What's up?

17:10.947 --> 17:14.534
Whatever you need to share with me,
my husband can hear too.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.331
Testing revealed that...

17:20.415 --> 17:23.793
Patrick is not Mazie's
biological father.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.712
- What?
- Not her father?

17:25.795 --> 17:27.422
Obviously there's been
some kind of mistake

17:27.505 --> 17:29.549
because that's... I mean,
that's just wrong.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.926
- Patrick is her father.
- How would that even be possible?

17:32.010 --> 17:34.345
Usually there would be
no reason to even bring this up.

17:34.429 --> 17:38.224
It's just that Mazie's best chance
at a match is a blood relative.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.768
And if we can gain contact
with the father...

17:39.851 --> 17:42.395
Oh, my God!
Patrick is the father!

17:42.479 --> 17:44.397
There's obviously something
wrong with your tests.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.691
We'll, um...

17:46.775 --> 17:49.569
We'll run the labs again,
see if we can get to the bottom of this.

17:49.652 --> 17:50.987
Yeah, you do that.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.579
Devon's father.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.164
Oh, my God!
Is he okay?

18:01.247 --> 18:03.666
Shh, shh.
He's sleeping. He's fine.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.210
What the hell, Gwen?
I must've called you a dozen times.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.295
Sandy said you never
showed up to daycare.

18:07.378 --> 18:10.757
Um... Devon woke up
with a runny nose.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.634
And he was
coughing last night,

18:12.717 --> 18:14.677
so I just thought
that I'd bring him in

18:14.761 --> 18:17.722
so he could get checked out.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.974
Better safe than sorry, right?

18:20.058 --> 18:21.184
Uh...

18:22.477 --> 18:24.813
I'm gonna leave you two.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.651
You should have
picked up your cell.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.528
I thought you were
in an accident.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.654
So that's it?

18:32.737 --> 18:35.156
We're just gonna keep
Gwen's husband in the dark?

18:35.240 --> 18:39.577
Well, I think she's afraid he'll use it
as ammunition to get full custody.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.330
Listen, if anyone was trying to take
Owen away from me,

18:42.413 --> 18:43.540
I don't know what I would do.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.251
But if something ever happened to him
and someone kept it from me...

18:46.334 --> 18:47.877
Trust me, I'm right
there with you.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.629
He has every right
to know the truth,

18:49.712 --> 18:51.881
but the truth should
come from Gwen.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.675
I can't lie to
my patient's father.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.343
I'm not asking you
to do that.

18:55.426 --> 18:59.430
Just give me a chance
to speak with her first.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.891
- Okay.
- All right.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.017
(KNOCKS)

19:03.101 --> 19:04.352
Hey, Michelle.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.980
I know you had some questions pertaining
to Sam's care earlier.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.524
- So I brought you a...
- Thank you.

19:09.607 --> 19:12.360
I've decided I want...

19:12.443 --> 19:14.320
Sam taken off life support.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.448
Oh.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.033
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

19:19.117 --> 19:21.619
Michelle, do you know
what you're saying?

19:21.703 --> 19:24.873
When I married Sam,
I made a vow.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.667
For better or for worse,
and I meant that.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.753
But this isn't about
what I would want.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.881
It's about what Sam
would want.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.633
That's right. It is.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.635
And there are still plenty
of things we can do

19:37.719 --> 19:39.888
to positively affect
Sam's outcome.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.472
He could still have
a meaningful life.

19:41.556 --> 19:42.640
How?

19:42.724 --> 19:45.518
I mean, not be able
to operate again?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.605
Not be able to feed or...
Or bathe himself?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.023
No.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.691
No, my husband
is a proud man.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.027
He's fiercely independent.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.654
He would resent me forever,
and I just...

19:56.738 --> 19:59.449
I just can't do that to him.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.617
We understand.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.244
Michelle, I just wonder
if this is a decision

20:03.328 --> 20:04.579
you should be taking on alone.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.873
Who else would take it on?
I'm his wife.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.416
You are.
Of a few months.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.126
- Dr. Choi.
- Excuse me?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.878
I'm sorry.
With all due respect,

20:11.961 --> 20:14.756
his daughter might be better equipped
to make this decision.

20:14.839 --> 20:18.259
I think what Dr. Choi
means is that

20:18.343 --> 20:21.387
maybe we should wait for Lucy
to come and say her goodbyes.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.513
No, that's not what I mean.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.557
Lucy has known Sam
her whole life.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.726
Dr. Choi...
Don't you think she should

20:26.809 --> 20:27.936
be able to speak for him?

20:28.019 --> 20:31.230
Sam wouldn't want Lucy
to have to make this call

20:31.314 --> 20:34.067
and he wouldn't want her
to see him like this.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.861
He would want her
to remember him at his best.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.571
MARCEL: Okay.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.615
We'll get
the paperwork started.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.171
- What's up?
- Had HR check Sam's

20:55.254 --> 20:56.381
life insurance policy.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.591
Turns out Michelle's on it.
She stands to gain millions.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.178
Not surprising.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.347
She married him three months
after meeting him,

21:04.430 --> 21:06.641
and from what his colleagues tell me,
she was the one who rushed it.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.768
You know what they say.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.853
When you know, you know.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.399
Look, I get it, your whole shtick.
You don't get invested.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.776
"Shtick"? Ha!

21:16.859 --> 21:20.196
No, I just don't stick my nose
where it doesn't belong.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.866
You know, like looking into
a patient's life insurance policy.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.202
Which med school class
they teach that in?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.954
First rule of medicine...

21:28.037 --> 21:29.539
is "do no harm."

21:29.622 --> 21:33.001
I'm not gonna ignore the red flags
just because you can't be bothered.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.586
Look, bottom line, Michelle
is Sam's next of kin.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.922
If she wants to take him off the vent,
we're taking him off.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.257
Yeah, we'll see about that.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.301
I'm convening an
emergency ethics committee.

21:46.347 --> 21:49.058
You know, this is
probably my fault.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.520
The other night, on my
way to my mom's house...

21:52.603 --> 21:53.980
And I was in a rush...

21:54.063 --> 21:55.940
I ran out without
even putting a coat on him.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.483
And I know better.
I just...

21:57.567 --> 22:00.945
We all make mistakes.
Right, Dr. Manning?

22:02.989 --> 22:05.366
The good news is, Devon's
temperature is back to normal

22:05.450 --> 22:07.785
and he is alert
and engaged.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.579
Isn't that right, buddy?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.164
(LAUGHS)

22:11.247 --> 22:12.874
You should be able
to discharge him soon.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.379
It's my mom.
I'm just gonna give her a quick update.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.589
Right.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.257
Gwen.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.260
Please leave me out of this.
I do not feel comfortable.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.262
You have no idea
what I'm dealing with here.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.598
Just don't say anything.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.099
I'm begging you.

22:31.601 --> 22:32.935
All good?

22:33.019 --> 22:35.271
Yup. She's gonna bring over
her chicken soup tonight.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.357
GARRETT: Ah. (CHUCKLES)

22:38.441 --> 22:40.526
Ms. Garrett,
the board meeting is in 15.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.487
We should reschedule.
My son is still...

22:42.570 --> 22:44.030
Go. I got this.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.406
Okay?

22:50.578 --> 22:52.413
Drug overdose in the U.S.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.666
is the leading cause of
death in people under 50.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.211
More than 68,000 Americans
died last year...

22:58.294 --> 23:00.546
Dr. Halstead, we're all aware

23:00.630 --> 23:02.882
of the devastating effects
of the opioid crisis.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.551
What I don't understand is why
you want to make it easier

23:05.676 --> 23:07.136
for addicts to use drugs.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.805
GAIL: And having
the site here.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.723
It looks like we're
condoning drug use.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.517
No, no.
We're not condoning it.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.520
We're trying to save lives
while also offering counseling...

23:15.603 --> 23:16.729
Do you have any evidence

23:16.813 --> 23:19.148
that these facilities
achieve that end?

23:19.232 --> 23:20.316
I do.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.820
Uh...

23:28.366 --> 23:31.327
A review of 75 studies shows
that safe injection sites

23:31.410 --> 23:32.620
reduce overdose deaths

23:32.703 --> 23:35.289
and the transmission
of infectious diseases,

23:35.373 --> 23:37.959
while increasing the number
of people starting treatment.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.837
Okay, but what happens
after these people finish shooting up?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.380
We will provide a space

23:42.463 --> 23:44.799
where they can rest until
their high subsides...

23:44.882 --> 23:46.634
- And what if they won't comply?
- Mmm.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.553
Exactly.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.430
Why don't we all just
take a little recess,

23:51.514 --> 23:53.558
stretch our legs,
get some coffee.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.691
I'm not getting through.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.401
I have an idea.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.366
So did you sort things out?

24:10.449 --> 24:11.742
I apologize for the wait.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.744
But, yes, we were able to
figure out what happened.

24:13.828 --> 24:15.079
At least in part.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.415
But we ran the labs again

24:17.498 --> 24:20.668
and Patrick is not Mazie's
biological father.

24:20.751 --> 24:24.172
- What? This is ridiculous.
- Whoa. Hang on. There's more.

24:24.255 --> 24:29.177
Layla, we went ahead and
karyotyped your blood sample

24:29.260 --> 24:31.762
and found that you are not
Mazie's biological mother.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.181
Wait, what?

24:33.264 --> 24:35.766
I don't understand. How is this possible?

then who are her parents?

24:42.773 --> 24:46.235
We don't know. We believe there must've
been a mix–up at the fertility clinic.

with the fertility clinic.

We need to track down Mazie's
biological parents right away.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.717
What if we can't find them?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.053
One step at a time.
We can just hope for the best.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.055
NOAH: All right. Let's move.

25:17.683 --> 25:21.270
I've been asked to come
and share some thoughts with you

25:21.354 --> 25:24.482
about safe injection sites.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.985
My younger brother Tommy,
he played baseball.

25:28.069 --> 25:32.240
His talent was such that
he was being scouted

25:32.323 --> 25:34.325
by big Division I schools

25:34.408 --> 25:37.787
when he was just a freshman
in high school.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.206
But then,
when he was around 15,

25:40.289 --> 25:43.876
he started to
gravitate towards,

25:43.960 --> 25:45.378
you know, not–so–great kids.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.256
He started to experiment
with drugs and alcohol

25:48.339 --> 25:51.550
and he was hooked on heroin
by the time he was 17.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.471
There was a good stretch there

25:55.554 --> 25:57.640
where Tommy
got himself healthy.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.601
You know, he got married,
had a kid.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.895
His arm was shot by then,

26:02.979 --> 26:06.190
but he loved teaching
his son the game.

26:06.274 --> 26:10.736
And he was actually getting him ready
for Little League tryouts

26:10.820 --> 26:13.114
when he died

26:13.197 --> 26:15.491
on the floor of his bathroom

26:15.574 --> 26:18.869
from a heroin overdose.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.831
My little brother was alone.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.835
I know this because
I'm the one who found him.

26:25.918 --> 26:30.631
And I was minutes...
Just minutes too late.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.720
The time that it took
for Tommy to die

26:35.803 --> 26:39.098
from lack of oxygen
to his brain

26:39.181 --> 26:40.641
are why sites

26:40.725 --> 26:43.561
like Dr. Halstead
is proposing today

26:43.644 --> 26:45.187
are so important.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.315
Because if he hadn't
been alone,

26:47.398 --> 26:49.817
if there had been somebody
there who had the tools

26:49.900 --> 26:51.736
and training to revive him...

26:53.571 --> 26:56.615
Tommy could very well
still be alive today.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.204
Thank you for your time.

27:07.043 --> 27:10.379
I think I speak for all of us

27:10.463 --> 27:14.091
when I say that Dr. Charles,
Dr. Halstead,

27:14.175 --> 27:16.719
you've made a very
compelling case.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.638
And while the official vote
won't happen

27:19.722 --> 27:24.352
until we've reviewed
the funding proposals for the quarter,

husband from life support,

27:40.659 --> 27:44.080

but he wouldn't want to live like this.

the truth on your own.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.273

caused the mix–up.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.515
would be with a guy
like me is money.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.809
No, no, no. I didn't
mean that at all.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.602
For your information,

32:58.686 --> 33:00.521
I'm the eye candy
in this relationship.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.775
You ever hear of
Max Amino Pro?

33:04.858 --> 33:06.944
The protein shake?

33:07.027 --> 33:09.196
Yeah, I drink it every day.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.615
Right, so does every fitness freak
in the country.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.075
My wife invented the formula.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.619
Yeah.

33:15.703 --> 33:17.079
Cha–ching.

33:18.372 --> 33:19.998
Now, if you'll excuse me...

33:33.262 --> 33:35.681
- You lying bitch.
- Mark.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.599
You will never be alone
with our child again.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.435
- Please, please. Let me...
- No.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.812
- Let me explain.
- You'll be hearing from my lawyer. No.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.398
He was asking questions
and blaming himself.

33:44.481 --> 33:45.566
I had to tell him the truth.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.484
You had no right
to insert yourself.

33:47.568 --> 33:50.195
- I am your baby's doctor.
- Do you see what you've done?

33:50.279 --> 33:51.989
- If I lose my son...
- Listen, Gwen...

33:52.072 --> 33:53.866
Sharon, this does not
concern you.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.160
Actually, it does.
I instructed Dr. Manning

33:56.243 --> 33:57.661
to be honest
with your husband.

33:57.745 --> 33:58.829
Ms. Goodwin, you don't...

33:58.912 --> 34:00.164
I confided in you.

34:00.247 --> 34:03.083
Lying to a minor's guardian?
Come on, Gwen!

34:03.167 --> 34:05.669
It's too big of a liability.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.379
You wanna talk about
liabilities?

34:08.589 --> 34:10.716
You can forget about
your little pet project.

34:10.799 --> 34:14.219
(SCOFFS)
- Consider the safe injection site dead.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.596
Really?

34:15.679 --> 34:20.392
You know, I actually thought that you
and I made some strides today.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.272
Me too.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.277
Ms. Goodwin, I'm sorry.
I couldn't...

34:30.360 --> 34:33.280
There is no need
for you to apologize.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.091
I just heard that the board passed.
I'm sorry.

34:53.175 --> 34:54.843
It was a valiant effort.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.094
I don't know
what the hell happened.

34:56.178 --> 34:59.681
They spouted some legalistic garbage
in the rejection email.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.975
They're just, you know...
They're afraid.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.477

35:03.560 --> 35:06.688
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.
There's another way.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.232
What do you mean?

35:12.486 --> 35:14.321
Look, I wanted to do this
on the up–and–up,

35:14.404 --> 35:17.533
but if they're not gonna let me
spearhead it at the hospital,

35:17.616 --> 35:21.036
I got a friend who's got
something already in the works.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.956
You mean an
unsanctioned site?

35:24.039 --> 35:25.499
You said it yourself.

35:25.582 --> 35:28.418
A site like this could've
saved your brother's life.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.711
I know how badly
you wanna help,

35:29.795 --> 35:32.089
but, buddy, they're illegal.

35:32.172 --> 35:35.175
I mean, you could
lose your license.

35:36.677 --> 35:37.886
Yeah. You're right.

35:39.513 --> 35:41.598
Thank you for your help today.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.267
Well, of course.

35:46.103 --> 35:47.145
WILL: And Dr. Charles...

35:49.356 --> 35:51.149
I'm sorry
about your brother.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.785
After testing and
speaking with the clinic,

36:01.869 --> 36:04.955
we can confirm they
made a terrible mistake

36:05.038 --> 36:06.373
and swapped your embryos.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.083
Denise is carrying
your baby.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.668
Oh, thank God.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.421
Uh... What about Mazie?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.423
Steve is a donor match.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.883
But I wasn't?

36:15.966 --> 36:17.009
Unfortunately, no.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.760
APRIL: Don't worry.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.846
There are other options
to find a second donor.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.639
We're getting her on
the transplant list.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.725
Wait, you said
I'm a match, right?

36:24.808 --> 36:26.143
You are, yes.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.229
Yeah.

36:29.313 --> 36:30.731
I'll do it.
I'll donate.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.941
We can't ask that of you.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.402
No, no, you have done more
for us than you know.

36:37.487 --> 36:40.949
Besides, me and Mazie,
we've been through a lot.

36:42.993 --> 36:45.829
And I know she isn't mine...

36:45.913 --> 36:48.457
But I still love her
like she is.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.933

You might've noticed I can
be a little quick to judge.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.919
I get it, man.
You were trying to do right by Sam.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.004
- It's all good.
- Not just with that.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.799
With you, too.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.552
Oh.

37:42.636 --> 37:44.846
- Well...
- Look, man.

37:44.930 --> 37:49.476
I made some assumptions about you.
The truth is, I really don't know you.

37:49.559 --> 37:52.562
Appreciate the sentiment,
but you don't...

37:54.439 --> 37:56.316
You don't have to worry
about it, man.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.694

Yeah, I do.

(CLEARS THROAT) Sure.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.705

- Hey.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.540
Nothing, just
saying good night.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.874
Oh.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.002
Well, good night,
Dr. Marcel.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.463
Good night.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.843
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:27.597 --> 38:30.350
- Ethan?
- Yeah?

38:30.475 --> 38:34.271
I want us to try to
get pregnant again.

38:34.354 --> 38:35.439
Really?

38:35.522 --> 38:37.607
What if we give IVF a shot?

38:37.691 --> 38:40.068
(SIGHS) I thought
you didn't want to go down that road.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.528
I know, I just...

38:43.280 --> 38:45.615
I was afraid.

38:45.699 --> 38:50.287
And IVF isn't a sure thing
and given my condition,

38:50.370 --> 38:52.789
it's possible it may
not even work,

38:52.873 --> 38:55.709
but there's a chance
that it could.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.255
It seems like it's
worth the risk.

- Yeah.
