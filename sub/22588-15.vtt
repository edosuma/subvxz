Oh, heck no. Miss Browning,
our poetry professor.

01:11.869 --> 01:14.604
Let's take a break, gang.
Anyone for a drink?

01:14.606 --> 01:16.305
Me.

01:27.651 --> 01:30.186
Holy cow! Look.

01:30.188 --> 01:31.787
Silver dollars.

01:31.789 --> 01:34.022
Let me try.

01:39.530 --> 01:43.032
Hey, kids, everyone.
Come one. It's Christmas.

01:43.034 --> 01:43.933
Look.

01:50.808 --> 01:52.474
Silver dollars.

01:52.676 --> 01:57.613
A strange disturbing bonanza
from a gimmick milk machine.

01:57.615 --> 02:01.083
Either of you men fear
what I fear?

02:02.119 --> 02:03.085
The Joker?

02:03.087 --> 02:04.920
Exactly, Chief O'Hara!
The Joker.

02:04.922 --> 02:07.756
That most pestilent
of predators.

02:07.758 --> 02:10.192
The Clown Prince Of Crime.

02:10.193 --> 02:13.729
This smells like an opening
gambit of his.

02:13.731 --> 02:14.463
That devil!

02:14.465 --> 02:17.966
- But how can we be sure?
- We can't. Not yet.

02:17.968 --> 02:19.668
But if it's The Joker
we're facing

02:19.670 --> 02:22.538
then his plot is aimed
at Gotham City youth.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.540
We can't wait to be sure.

02:24.542 --> 02:27.075
Now this if there ever
was one is a case

02:27.077 --> 02:31.814
for our unknown friend
behind the mask.

02:41.759 --> 02:44.960
<i> And in Wayne Manor, stately</i>
<i> residents of millionaire</i>

02:44.962 --> 02:49.131
<i> socialite Bruce Wayne and his</i>
<i> young ward Dick Grayson</i>

02:49.133 --> 02:52.067
<i> whom we just saw at school.</i>

02:57.708 --> 03:02.011
Please, Bruce, I beg you.
Accept the proposal.

03:02.013 --> 03:03.546
Run for mayor.

03:04.048 --> 03:04.780
It's funny.

03:04.782 --> 03:08.484
They come to you with the same
offer every two years.

03:08.486 --> 03:11.053
You'd think they'd get it
through their heads

03:11.055 --> 03:11.954
you're not interested.

03:11.956 --> 03:14.089
I'm afraid she's right,
Mr. Vandergilt.

03:14.091 --> 03:16.725
You see the good works
of my Wayne Foundation

03:16.727 --> 03:20.229
require that I stay above
the brawl of politics.

03:20.231 --> 03:23.165
But Gotham City needs you.

03:23.167 --> 03:24.633
Think of our problems.

03:24.635 --> 03:27.970
The snarl of traffic.
A water shortage.

03:27.972 --> 03:30.939
And now these recurrent
power failures.

03:30.941 --> 03:33.976
'How can you turn this down?'

03:33.978 --> 03:34.743
Ahem!

03:34.745 --> 03:36.879
'What is it, Alfred?'

03:36.881 --> 03:39.081
Nothing of importance, madam.

03:40.985 --> 03:42.651
It's the Bat-phone, sir.

03:42.653 --> 03:45.921
Thank you, Alfred,
for reminding me.

03:45.923 --> 03:47.956
I tell you what, Mr. Vandergilt.

03:47.958 --> 03:52.194
I'll ponder it
and give you my answer tomorrow.

03:52.196 --> 03:54.796
Aunt Harriet,
give Mr. Vandergilt

03:54.798 --> 03:56.932
some more tea, will you?

03:58.569 --> 04:00.236
He'll ponder it?

04:00.538 --> 04:03.805
That's strange.
What's he got to ponder?

04:03.807 --> 04:04.640
Yes, commissioner.

04:04.642 --> 04:06.074
'Prepare yourself for a blow.'

04:06.076 --> 04:08.911
Someone has struck in
Woodrow Roosevelt High.

04:08.913 --> 04:10.712
We think it's The Joker.

04:10.714 --> 04:13.982
Good grief!
I'm on my way.

04:14.852 --> 04:16.618
Dick's in the thick
of this already.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.521
If he calls,
tell him to stay where he is.

04:18.523 --> 04:21.390
- Very good, sir.
- The switch, Alfred.

04:23.061 --> 04:24.827
Good luck, sir.

Joker released from jail

06:00.491 --> 06:01.957
immediately buys control

of One-Armed Bandit Novelty
Company.

06:04.829 --> 06:06.095
Makers of coin operated gadgets.

06:06.097 --> 06:09.031
Gum machines, pin balls,
that sort of harmless junk.

06:09.033 --> 06:12.835
There's nothing harmless about
The Joker, we all know that.

06:12.837 --> 06:17.706
Or about a machine which returns
20 silver dollars for a dime.

06:17.708 --> 06:21.677
What about the men who install
the machine and service it?

06:21.679 --> 06:22.711
Clean as driven snow, Batman.

06:22.713 --> 06:25.080

than we are.

06:25.082 --> 06:26.081
Ah, it's open and shut.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.951
Somebody got to that poor
innocent machine

06:28.953 --> 06:29.818
and gimmicked it.

06:29.820 --> 06:34.123
But why?
In the devil's name, why?

06:34.125 --> 06:36.625
I can make a guess.

06:38.129 --> 06:38.861
Yes.

06:38.863 --> 06:41.964
Oh, thank you, Bonnie.
Put him on the conference phone.

06:41.966 --> 06:46.068
It's Principal Schoolfield.
Woodrow Roosevelt High.

06:47.471 --> 06:49.505
'Commissioner Gordon?'

06:49.507 --> 06:50.005
Speaking.

06:50.007 --> 06:52.574
Another machine has gone mad.

06:52.576 --> 06:54.009
In the library.

06:54.011 --> 06:55.110
Instead of candy bars

06:55.112 --> 06:58.480
it's dispensing negotiable
stocks and bonds.

06:58.482 --> 07:01.750
'To put it mildly,
student morale is cracking up.'

07:01.752 --> 07:05.120
Schoolfield,
this is Batman here.

07:05.122 --> 07:05.921
Do you hear me?

07:05.923 --> 07:07.623
'Ah, yes, hello, Batman.'

07:07.625 --> 07:09.558
Who's the president
of your student council?

07:09.560 --> 07:13.429
A boy named Grayson.
Uh, Richard Grayson.

07:13.431 --> 07:14.830
'A fine lad.'

07:14.832 --> 07:16.131
I'm glad to hear it.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.967
Have him call a meeting
in your office

07:18.969 --> 07:19.835
I'll be right there.

07:19.837 --> 07:22.137
I'll have him waiting for you.

07:22.139 --> 07:23.138
Goodbye.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.008
- I think my guess was right.
- What, Batman?

07:27.010 --> 07:27.743
No time to lose.

07:27.745 --> 07:30.812
Chief O'Hara, get me a visual
ID file on The Joker.

07:30.814 --> 07:33.849
- Meet me at the Batmobile.
- Yes, sir.

07:39.823 --> 07:41.456
I mean, like, look, Dicky.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.991
So everyone's goofing off.

07:42.993 --> 07:45.293
- So why shouldn't they?
- It's quite true.

07:45.295 --> 07:48.196
The purpose of our studies
is to equip us

07:48.198 --> 07:49.431
to make our way in life.

07:49.433 --> 07:51.066
If on the other hand

07:51.068 --> 07:53.401
one has merely to insert
a dime in a machine--

07:53.403 --> 07:56.505
He's right. Why go through
all that studying?

07:56.507 --> 07:59.374
Cryin' out loud!
I'm surprised at you guys.

07:59.376 --> 08:02.344
We're meant
to be student leaders.

08:02.346 --> 08:04.312
Susie, what do you say?

08:04.314 --> 08:06.348
I say, has anyone tried

08:06.350 --> 08:09.451
Mr. Schoolfield's coffee
machine?

08:15.226 --> 08:18.694
Hey, not bad
for old Schoolfield.

08:18.696 --> 08:21.630
Quarters! Look.

08:21.632 --> 08:22.531
Hey, not bad, eh?

08:22.733 --> 08:25.400
- How about that?
- Wise up, you guys.

08:25.402 --> 08:26.234
Life isn't this easy.

08:26.236 --> 08:28.036
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

08:28.038 --> 08:30.238
You're the ward of that
rich millionaire.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.740
That has nothing to do with it.

08:31.742 --> 08:35.376
Hey, Gray, cut it out.
Here comes Batman.

08:47.991 --> 08:51.059
Sorry, kids. Stay back.
Sorry, Robin isn't with me.

08:51.061 --> 08:55.163
This Batmobile is filled with
delicate anti-crime equipment.

08:55.165 --> 08:58.834
You might set of the automatic
anti-theft system.

08:58.836 --> 09:01.303
Nobody closer
than 50 feet, please.

09:01.305 --> 09:02.771
Hey, Batman, where's Robin?

09:02.773 --> 09:05.040
'Attending school.
Just as you are.'

09:05.042 --> 09:07.075
- What school?
- I can't tell you that.

09:07.077 --> 09:09.377
It might reveal his secret
true identity.

09:09.379 --> 09:12.481
Now, listen, if anyone hears
a sharp beep

09:12.483 --> 09:13.381
'let me know at once.'

09:13.383 --> 09:18.320
It'll be the Bat-phone ring
with an important message.

09:26.763 --> 09:30.164
<i> And even as Batman races</i>
<i> into the school</i>

09:30.166 --> 09:35.703
<i> across town in a fashionable</i>
<i> little bistro.</i>

09:53.323 --> 09:59.862
'Ha ha ha, the joke's on you,
my cherry booze hounds.'

09:59.864 --> 10:02.164
'It's a stick up!'

10:02.867 --> 10:06.568
'Hands up, you coward.'

10:22.019 --> 10:28.223
'Thanks, folks.
The party will now resume.'

10:31.261 --> 10:34.796
Believe me, this may look
like a party but it's not.

10:34.798 --> 10:36.498
There's a crook behind
these handouts.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.168
- What's his angle?
- He may have several.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.036
One is to lure you

10:41.038 --> 10:42.637
into a receptive pattern
of easy living.

10:42.639 --> 10:45.340
You'll quit your studies,
become dropouts.

10:45.342 --> 10:49.144
You'll have no other recourse
but to join criminal groups.

10:49.146 --> 10:52.247
Batman's right.
It's sort of...recruiting drive.

10:52.249 --> 10:54.249
Sure, he's right.
What did I tell you?

10:54.251 --> 10:56.551
Can you corroborate
this odd hypothesis?

10:56.553 --> 10:58.553
Yeah, Batman, like,
what's the crook's name?

10:58.555 --> 11:01.723
I can do better than that.
I can show you his picture.

11:01.725 --> 11:04.225
- What's your name, son?
- Richard Grayson, sir?

11:04.227 --> 11:05.126
'Thank you, Richard.'

11:05.128 --> 11:08.063
You darken the room,
I'll man the projector.

11:08.065 --> 11:09.397
Roger.

11:12.235 --> 11:16.204
Here it is, everybody,
The Joker.

11:16.206 --> 11:20.108
'Don't be deceived
by that grin, anyone.'

11:20.110 --> 11:24.079
'He's one of the most malevolent
malefactors we've ever met.'

11:24.081 --> 11:26.514
I'll bet he's a master
of makeup too.

11:26.516 --> 11:28.316
You're right. He is.

11:28.318 --> 11:30.285
He might be skulking
around here

11:30.287 --> 11:33.688
in any one of
50 outrageous outfits.

11:33.690 --> 11:38.259
For example,
here's another one.

11:38.261 --> 11:39.227
'A little closer, kids.'

11:39.229 --> 11:44.699
'I want you to see that phony
flower in his button hole.'

11:47.337 --> 11:50.005
Sometimes it shoots out water.

11:50.007 --> 11:52.307
Sometimes powder.

11:52.309 --> 11:55.877
'Other times,
knock-out gas.'

11:55.879 --> 11:56.545
Hey!

11:56.547 --> 12:00.182
Holy magician!

12:01.552 --> 12:06.121
Hello, kiddies,
meet The Joker.

12:06.123 --> 12:07.522
And no hard feelings.

12:07.524 --> 12:10.125
Ow!

12:10.127 --> 12:11.326
Corny, aren't I?

12:11.328 --> 12:12.561
Joker, what are you
doing here?

12:12.563 --> 12:14.930
Oh, just passing by.
I heard my name

12:14.932 --> 12:17.165
and I couldn't resist
shooting a jolly jet

12:17.167 --> 12:19.835
through the tiny perforation
in that screen.

12:19.837 --> 12:22.270
Just passing by, huh?
To do what?

12:22.272 --> 12:24.606
Gimmick another innocent
vending machine?

12:24.608 --> 12:27.442
Oh, there must be bats
in your belfry, Batman.

12:27.444 --> 12:31.246
Has anyone found fingerprints
or other evidence?

12:31.248 --> 12:33.148
You're too smart for that,
Joker.

12:33.150 --> 12:34.883
Hey, Batman,
nab him anyway.

12:34.885 --> 12:36.418
Loitering on school property.

12:36.420 --> 12:41.056
Right. $5000 fine
and five years imprisonment.

12:41.058 --> 12:42.490
Ha ha! No.

12:42.492 --> 12:43.558
Wrong, kiddies.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.426
Look up the statute.

12:44.428 --> 12:47.929
In Gotham City, the crime of
loitering requires the loiterer

12:47.931 --> 12:52.267
to remain in the same spot
for over two minutes.

12:52.269 --> 12:55.337
You..
You jailhouse lawyer!

12:55.339 --> 12:59.374
A tricky trickster!
He's outwittin' us.

12:59.376 --> 13:00.375
Oh, dear me!

13:00.377 --> 13:04.980
The court jester must run.
Jest in time.

13:05.549 --> 13:08.416
Well, goodbye, kiddies.
And remember

13:08.418 --> 13:10.652
I was here, eh!

13:13.290 --> 13:14.222
What an odd parting remark.

13:14.224 --> 13:17.893
Yeah, why does he want us
to remember he was here?

13:17.895 --> 13:23.565
From the lips of a crook,
it can mean only one thing.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.033
Establishing an alibi.

13:25.035 --> 13:25.467
Right.

13:25.669 --> 13:29.304
Gee whiz!
Alibi for what?

13:40.350 --> 13:41.650
The Bat-phone signal.

13:41.652 --> 13:43.485
- Batman!
- Hey, Batman!

13:43.487 --> 13:45.320
'It's your Bat-phone.'

13:45.322 --> 13:48.423
'The Bat-phone, Batman!'

13:59.536 --> 14:00.468
What now, commissioner?

14:00.470 --> 14:02.671
Another strike.
A cocktail lounge.

14:02.673 --> 14:05.273
A gimmick jukebox.
It must be The Joker.

14:05.275 --> 14:07.542
We'll never make it stick.
He has an alibi.

14:07.544 --> 14:11.546
- 'Maybe we can bring him.'
- Impossible, the alibi is me.

14:11.548 --> 14:13.315
- What? You?
- Forget it.

14:13.317 --> 14:17.719
Give me the address. I'll race
to the scene of the crime.

14:17.721 --> 14:19.287
Right.
Goodbye.

14:19.289 --> 14:22.257
'Batman, sir.'

14:22.259 --> 14:23.992
You forgot your
box of slides.

14:23.994 --> 14:27.162
Good, lad.
Bring it over.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.700
Fake a headache,
speed home

14:31.702 --> 14:34.102
wait for me in the Bat-cave.

14:34.104 --> 14:36.471
You're welcome, sir.

14:39.009 --> 14:41.076
Boys and girls,
go back to your studies.

14:41.078 --> 14:45.580
'Believe me,
nothing in life is free!'

15:06.604 --> 15:08.671
<i> Scarcely, 500 yards away</i>

15:08.673 --> 15:11.740
<i> behind this innocent seeming</i>
<i> candy store</i>

15:11.742 --> 15:15.544
<i> an abandoned garage,</i>
<i> now headquarters of The Joker</i>

15:15.546 --> 15:18.414
<i> and his current gang,</i>
<i> the Bad Pennies.</i>

15:18.416 --> 15:20.950
<i> High school dropouts,</i>
<i> most of them.</i>

15:20.952 --> 15:22.851
It's a pretty good haul,
isn't it?

15:22.853 --> 15:24.853
Peanuts, my boy,
mere peanuts.

15:24.855 --> 15:28.424
That bar job was just
a pot boiling appetizer

15:28.426 --> 15:29.325
for the real feast.

15:29.327 --> 15:31.927
Oh-ho-ho! What an inspired
stroke of mind

15:31.929 --> 15:36.732
buying up the One-Armed Bandit
Novelty Company.

15:36.734 --> 15:38.634
Plunder by remote control.

15:39.303 --> 15:42.238
Hey, Joker, I think
I got this one rigged.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.305
Come and have a look.

15:43.307 --> 15:46.475
- Put it all away.
- Right.

15:47.945 --> 15:49.678
Set to go off
on the third strike?

15:49.680 --> 15:52.748
Yeah, and I got two strikes
rung up already.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.384
Ho-ho!
Here we go!

15:59.624 --> 16:00.756
Sensational!
It's a gas!

16:00.758 --> 16:03.325
Oh, you won't be caught
smoking a bar.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.560
It'll be your knock-out stuff.

16:04.562 --> 16:06.662
You've done it again,
Two Bits.

16:06.664 --> 16:08.864
Thank--

16:08.866 --> 16:14.336
A timed reminder,
crime can be shocking.

16:15.339 --> 16:18.974
Someone's trying
the bubblegum machine.

16:24.415 --> 16:25.414
Hiya, gang!

16:25.416 --> 16:29.652
Sweet Sue, shiniest
of my Bad Pennies.

16:29.654 --> 16:31.487
Boy, Joker, you sure
are some card.

16:31.489 --> 16:33.922
Popping out at school
like that at Batman.

16:33.924 --> 16:36.725
Wondrously whimsical,
wasn't it?

16:36.727 --> 16:38.761
It was real crazy
if you ask me.

16:38.763 --> 16:42.364
I might have fainted
and given the whole game away.

16:42.366 --> 16:43.399
However, you didn't.

16:43.401 --> 16:44.833
Ah, I see you have this stuff.

16:44.835 --> 16:47.436
- Of course.
- Any trouble getting it?

16:47.438 --> 16:48.671
Heck no.
Like I told you

16:48.673 --> 16:51.440
being chief cheerleader
puts me on the student council.

16:51.442 --> 16:54.977
Once you're on that,
you can get away with anything.

16:54.979 --> 16:55.678
Let's see.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.580
Hands off.
Not until I get paid.

16:58.582 --> 17:01.917
Trusting little wench,
aren't you?

17:01.919 --> 17:05.020
I'm a crook, Joker,
just like you.

17:05.021 --> 17:07.089
Now where's the payoff?

17:07.090 --> 17:08.723
Oh!

17:09.660 --> 17:12.461
Hiya there, lamb chop,
you busy tonight?

17:12.463 --> 17:13.962
You lowlife,
get away from me.

17:13.964 --> 17:16.065
Now, look here, baby,
I have plans--

17:16.067 --> 17:17.800
Are you stupid
or something?

17:17.801 --> 17:18.867
The reason
I've taken up crime

17:18.868 --> 17:22.771
is so I can get a taste
of the finer things in life.

17:22.772 --> 17:24.940
- Yeah--
- Now beat it!

17:24.942 --> 17:25.574
Uh-oh.

17:25.576 --> 17:28.877
- Shut your eyes, Sweet Susie.
- Oh, yeah?

17:28.879 --> 17:31.613
And get an exploding cigar
in my ears?

17:31.615 --> 17:32.114
No, thanks.

17:32.116 --> 17:36.518
You mischievous varmint,
shut your eyes, I said.

17:39.357 --> 17:41.990
Rhinestone bracelet.

17:41.992 --> 17:43.125
A fox fur stole..

17:43.127 --> 17:49.131
...and one full quart of
imported Mexican perfume.

17:49.133 --> 17:52.368
Oh, gee, Joker.

17:52.370 --> 17:55.637
I'm sorry I sassed you.

17:57.875 --> 18:02.745
Why, this is like
some lovely dream.

18:04.014 --> 18:05.614
Ah! Perfect!

18:05.616 --> 18:08.016
Stolen right
from Schoolfield's safe.

18:08.018 --> 18:11.453
The key card to my
malevolent machination.

18:11.455 --> 18:12.588
But what is it, Joker?

18:12.590 --> 18:15.824
Look, you boobs.
Look and laugh.

18:15.826 --> 18:18.527
Examination papers.

18:23.501 --> 18:25.134
X plus Y

18:25.136 --> 18:27.469
times X plus Y..

18:27.471 --> 18:29.505
Holy alphabet,
what is it?

18:29.507 --> 18:32.007
If you'll excuse me,
Master Robin.

18:32.009 --> 18:32.708
Yes, Alfred?

18:32.710 --> 18:36.612
The solution is
X squared plus 2XY

18:36.614 --> 18:37.179
plus Y squared.

18:37.181 --> 18:39.815
Gee, sure!
Why didn't I know that?

18:39.817 --> 18:42.751
And with nationwide
pre-college exams coming up

18:42.753 --> 18:44.720
in just three days.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.566
Good to have you home.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.635
- What'd you find out, Batman?
- Nothing.

18:59.637 --> 19:01.503
Holy vacuum,
not a single clue?

19:01.505 --> 19:02.704
We don't need clues, Robin.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.706
We know our man
is The Joker.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.041
What we need is evidence.

19:06.043 --> 19:09.478
I went over that looted lounge
with a fine toothed comb

19:09.480 --> 19:12.614
I didn't even find
a single hair to analyze.

19:12.616 --> 19:13.048
Gosh.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.450
And school morale
in a tailspin.

19:14.452 --> 19:17.586
Come a month from now, there'll
be dropouts by the bushel.

19:17.588 --> 19:19.087
- 'If he waits that long.'
- Huh?

19:19.089 --> 19:22.458
I didn't want to cause panic
at the student meeting.

19:22.460 --> 19:27.062
But I think The Joker has some
other dirty plan afoot as well.

19:27.064 --> 19:29.231
- Like what?
- 'I don't know.'

19:29.233 --> 19:32.067
But I think it involves
gimmicked machines

19:32.069 --> 19:33.202
and Woodrow Roosevelt High.

19:33.204 --> 19:36.605
Gee, if we just knew
how he gets in to fix them.

19:36.607 --> 19:38.841
You've guessed it, Robin.
Our next move.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.643
- Stake out the school.
- Right again.

19:40.645 --> 19:43.012
Let's go!

20:22.020 --> 20:22.986
Hello, hello.

20:22.988 --> 20:23.820
Give me the sign.

20:23.822 --> 20:26.656
How do you stop a dog
from barking in July?

20:26.658 --> 20:29.826
Countersign,
Shoot them in June.

20:29.828 --> 20:30.860
Very good.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.697
Listen, Batman and Robin just
drove into the parking lot.

20:34.699 --> 20:38.001
What? The Dynamic Duo
at the school?

20:38.003 --> 20:38.902
That's right, Joker.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.970
What'll I do?
Take another lam?

20:40.972 --> 20:42.672
No, no, no, no,
listen.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.440
Oh. Ha ha ha.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.543
Thank heavens for my
delicious sense of humor.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.145
You have your crooked keys,
don't you?

20:49.147 --> 20:49.779
Natch.

20:49.781 --> 20:54.017
'Alright, Sweet Sue.
Find key 17.'

20:54.019 --> 20:58.188
'Do exactly as I tell you.'

21:02.227 --> 21:05.462
- Gain level set.
- Okay.

21:05.464 --> 21:09.566
Set the anti-theft systems.
Let's go.

21:16.808 --> 21:17.240
Susie.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.509
Wow, am I ever glad
to see you two.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.745
Just now, I saw a suspicious
character in the gym.

21:22.747 --> 21:23.847
Quick! Run to safety.

21:23.849 --> 21:26.683
We'll take care of him.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.818
Wait, Batman,
look, a machine.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.253
It's been tampered with.

21:30.255 --> 21:33.256
This might be tricky.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.258
Get out your Bat-a-rang.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.961
I'll slip in a dime.

21:45.504 --> 21:48.705
Holy ball and chain!

21:51.209 --> 21:54.744
Quick! Let's get out
our cutting tools.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.282
The knock-out gas.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.861
<i> Twelve and one half minutes</i>
<i> later</i>

22:11.863 --> 22:15.765
<i> inside this curious vehicle..</i>

22:20.872 --> 22:21.871
It's all hooked up, boys.

22:21.873 --> 22:24.707
50,000 volts,
straight from the city main.

22:24.709 --> 22:25.875
Good.

22:27.078 --> 22:30.246
Gosh, Joker, this sure is some
crazy mixed-up moving van.

22:30.248 --> 22:34.117
One of the assets of the
One-Armed Bandit Novelty Company

22:34.119 --> 22:37.086
built for a whimsical
Caribbean dictator.

22:37.088 --> 22:40.924
Happily for us if not
for the Dynamic Duo.

22:40.926 --> 22:44.060
Uh, deposed before delivery.

22:50.602 --> 22:51.234
Oh, they're waking up.

22:51.236 --> 22:54.170
Careful no, my dimple darling.
No names.

22:54.172 --> 22:57.106
I'll speak to them through
this trick microphone

22:57.108 --> 23:00.743
that disguises our voices.

23:00.745 --> 23:03.146
'Oh, what a paw.'

23:03.148 --> 23:04.180
Holy Las Vegas!
Where are we?

23:04.182 --> 23:08.952
'In a strange kind
of game room, boy blunder.'

23:08.954 --> 23:11.821
Do you see the machine
next to you?

23:11.823 --> 23:12.221
'Right.'

23:12.223 --> 23:16.192
'It's going to spin around
merrily and merrily.'

23:16.194 --> 23:17.627
What's the payoff?

23:17.629 --> 23:20.997
Three liberty bells,
your freedom..

23:20.999 --> 23:23.900
...and $50,000 cash.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.736
'Three oranges,
your freedom only.'

23:26.738 --> 23:30.039
And if it's three lemons,
which the percentages say

23:30.041 --> 23:30.907
is the more likely.

23:30.909 --> 23:35.378
50,000 volts of electrifying
electricity

23:35.380 --> 23:37.380
my fettered fatman.

23:37.382 --> 23:41.017
'Automatically
on the third lemon.'

23:41.019 --> 23:42.018
Holy fruit salad.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.620
Sorry, I don't approve
of gambling.

23:43.622 --> 23:46.656
'Enough, my captured
caped crusaders.'

23:46.658 --> 23:49.826
I guarantee this machine
is fair.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.061
So let the game commence.

24:01.039 --> 24:04.273
<i> Horrors!</i>
<i> One lemon.</i>

24:05.243 --> 24:09.646
<i> Double horrors!</i>
<i> Two lemons.</i>

24:09.648 --> 24:13.383
<i> And if it's a third,</i>
<i> instant and inescapable</i>

24:13.385 --> 24:16.919
<i> 50,000 volts.</i>

24:17.722 --> 24:21.124
<i> Close your eyes.</i>
<i> Who dares to see it?</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:24.394
<i> Try us tomorrow,</i>
<i> same Bat-time</i>

24:24.396 --> 24:27.263
<i> same Bat-channel.</i>
