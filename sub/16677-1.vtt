00:54.620 --> 00:56.487
Now, the whole country
is in a panic.

00:56.489 --> 00:59.290
We've been summoned
to the White House

00:59.292 --> 01:01.726
knowing that the World War
is upon us.

01:01.728 --> 01:05.163
Well, he comes bursting
down the stairs

01:05.165 --> 01:08.533
with his dick resting
over a hanger shouting,

01:08.535 --> 01:12.803
"Does this look too wrinkled
to wear into Congress?"

01:13.372 --> 01:17.308
But that was Woodrow Wilson
for you.

01:17.310 --> 01:20.545
He just didn't give a fuck.

01:21.613 --> 01:23.414
The next day

01:23.416 --> 01:26.584
we entered World War I,

01:26.586 --> 01:29.053
and the bitch of it is...

01:29.988 --> 01:32.790
I never got my iron back.

01:34.993 --> 01:36.327
We got movement.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.197
What do you think Bronson,
is this our grizzly?

01:39.199 --> 01:40.231
Can't tell.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.401
It's moving between the trees
too quickly.

01:43.403 --> 01:46.204
Have a look Governor Roosevelt.

01:49.608 --> 01:53.911
Oh, my God!

01:53.913 --> 01:56.280
What is it?

01:56.982 --> 01:58.482
Werewolf!

01:58.484 --> 02:00.551
Everybody run!

02:06.792 --> 02:08.359
We're all going to die!

02:08.360 --> 02:11.862
Don't panic, we just got to make
it back to the cabin.

02:13.432 --> 02:16.400
Wait! Wait!

02:16.568 --> 02:19.170
Why me?
I'm fat and weak.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.172
Probably for exactly
that reason.

02:21.174 --> 02:21.772
No!

02:21.774 --> 02:25.076
Let's get some, boys. No, we
got to keep moving, Frank.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.677
They carry polio.

02:37.723 --> 02:41.559
Fuck polio.

02:45.097 --> 02:46.063
Good shot, old boy.

02:46.065 --> 02:48.299
Did you put silver bullets
in that thing, Frank?

02:48.301 --> 02:50.601
No, why?

02:54.673 --> 02:56.707
That's why. Run!

02:56.709 --> 02:58.609
Oh, shit.

02:58.611 --> 03:02.046
Sweet Jesus!

03:11.056 --> 03:12.757
What the shit?

03:12.759 --> 03:13.591
Ooh!

03:13.593 --> 03:17.361
Why even spend the time
to do that?

03:17.863 --> 03:19.397
Frank, we got to get
the hell out of here.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.166
No chair lift,
we're never going to make it.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.502
We're going to have to go
old school on this.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.738
This isn't a time for that--
we need silver bullets.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.334
Oh, sick goblins!

03:56.336 --> 03:58.636
Frank, I'm sorry.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.672
Tell Eleanor I love her.

04:04.176 --> 04:06.610
Eleanor has silver bullets.

04:14.853 --> 04:16.487
Eleanor.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.490
Frank, stay with me.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.492
Stay with me, Frank.

04:25.230 --> 04:30.468
Frank, Frank,
stay with me, Frank.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.570
Please.

04:36.608 --> 04:38.175
Oh, thank God.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.744
Oh, I thought
you were dead, Frank.

04:39.746 --> 04:44.181
Ain't nobody going to take down
The Delano, Kitten Tits.

04:44.183 --> 04:47.385
Kitten Breasts, Frank.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.753
Hey, Frank, how you feeling?

04:48.755 --> 04:53.257
Like a bag full of dicks
at a lesbian convention.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.059
Oh, language, Franklin.

04:55.061 --> 05:00.798
Eh, Comme sucka des
dicks at a convention de lesbian.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.433
Oh, that's better.

05:05.537 --> 05:07.304
Easy Lou, just me.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.906
Put that hamster back
in its cage.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.409
Glad to see you awake,
Governor Roosevelt.

05:11.411 --> 05:15.179
Let me just say, on behalf
of the great State of New York,

05:15.181 --> 05:16.747
it is our honor--
Cut the shit, doc.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.216
If I wanted smoke
blown up my ass,

05:19.218 --> 05:20.384
I would have spread my cheeks

05:20.386 --> 05:24.255
and jammed a whistling teapot
up there.

05:25.857 --> 05:28.225
Why can't I feel my legs?

05:28.227 --> 05:31.662
When the werewolf attacked you
and bit your leg,

05:31.664 --> 05:34.698
it released a small stream of--

05:35.967 --> 05:39.069
You've got the polio, Frank.

05:40.405 --> 05:41.939
Does my cock still work?

05:41.941 --> 05:45.576
Yes, I had one of the nurses
run tests.

05:49.014 --> 05:49.847
Well,

05:49.849 --> 05:53.284
why is everybody looking
so down? Cock works.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.086
I'll be up and at it
in no time.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.956
Oh, in two weeks, Lou,
I want a rematch

05:58.958 --> 06:01.492
of that 100 yard dash,
you son of a bitch.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.427
I'm going to get you this time!

06:03.429 --> 06:05.529
I'm going to get you!

06:05.531 --> 06:08.132
Frank, Frank,
you're not hearing me.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.801
You'll never be able
to walk again.

06:10.803 --> 06:11.435
What?

06:11.437 --> 06:13.003
That's the thing
about werewolf attacks--

06:13.005 --> 06:16.907
where you're bitten is where
the polio sets in.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.143
In your case...

06:20.946 --> 06:23.147
it's your legs.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.316
Oh!

06:25.318 --> 06:28.853
God, no.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.620
Why?

06:29.622 --> 06:34.391
Why did you have to give him tiny,
little, shriveled-up polio legs?

06:34.393 --> 06:37.695
Why, why!

06:37.697 --> 06:39.296
I love you Eleanor,

06:39.298 --> 06:41.332
but you got to just
shut-the-fuck-up

06:41.334 --> 06:42.566
when grown men
are conversing!

06:42.568 --> 06:45.236
Fortunately, Louis got you
to the hospital

06:45.238 --> 06:47.638
before the polio spread
to your--

06:49.174 --> 06:51.775
Good looking out, Lou.

06:52.878 --> 06:55.446
On the reels,
I'll never walk again?

06:55.448 --> 06:57.348
Can't something be did?

06:57.350 --> 06:59.683
If I'm going to give you real
barbershop talk,

06:59.685 --> 07:01.919
no rashes, no chalk--
with rehabilitation

07:01.921 --> 07:04.021
you might be able to stand
with leg braces--

07:04.023 --> 07:05.456
possibly a cane.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.359
But you will never again walk
without guided assistance.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.494
Well, fuck it then! Just get
a goddamn hacksaw up here

07:10.496 --> 07:14.198
and cut my legs off and sew them
on his goddamn body!

07:14.200 --> 07:15.533
Oh, let's do that.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.700
Keep your pants on, Louis.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.469
That isn't how this works.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.938
There's nothing more we can do.

07:21.573 --> 07:24.141
Mr. Roosevelt,
I'm so very sorry.

07:24.143 --> 07:27.478
Eleanor can take you home
this afternoon.

07:33.618 --> 07:36.253
All right, thank you, doctor.

07:36.255 --> 07:39.890
Louis, can I see you
out in the hallway for a moment?

07:42.060 --> 07:43.827
Shut up.

07:43.829 --> 07:47.998
What's the skinny, pill pusher?
It's not good for me to leave the Gov by himself.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.534
There's something I need
to show you.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.237
Do not grab your dick and ask me
to guess the temperature.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.306
Motherfucker, I'm not playing
hide the keys

07:55.308 --> 07:57.007
from the jailer either,
understand?

07:57.009 --> 07:58.342
Put the gun away.

07:58.344 --> 07:59.510
What I'm about to show you

07:59.512 --> 08:01.312
affects not only
Governor Roosevelt,

08:01.314 --> 08:04.181
but possibly all of mankind.

08:08.486 --> 08:10.621
I don't understand--
why are we in the morgue?

08:10.623 --> 08:15.559
This is what I wanted
to show you.

08:16.761 --> 08:18.028
What the fuck, bro?

08:18.030 --> 08:20.130
Sorry, wrong one.

08:22.133 --> 08:26.403
This is what I wanted
to show you.

08:27.806 --> 08:29.139
That thing's dead, right?

08:29.141 --> 08:31.141
Yes, I had a male nurse
check him out.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.309
I won't go into details,
but I owed him a favor.

08:33.312 --> 08:37.914
Anyway, while he was
shaving him, he found this.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.351
Is that a belly tattoo
of a swastika?

08:40.352 --> 08:43.187
The detail's amazing--
Those fucking Germans, man,

08:43.188 --> 08:44.388
their craftsmanship
is unmatched.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.457
How do you know the werewolf
is German?

08:46.459 --> 08:48.792
Besides the swastika,

08:48.794 --> 08:51.195
we found this on him.

08:51.863 --> 08:52.529
But why?

08:52.531 --> 08:55.432
We're not at war with Germany
anymore-- this doesn't add up.

08:55.434 --> 08:58.202
I'm not a mathematician,
I'm a damn doctor!

08:58.204 --> 09:00.371
And I didn't train on wolves.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.271
Plus, he's a German.

09:01.273 --> 09:02.973
We have to call in
the authorities.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.541
You shut that whole
spitting shit

09:04.543 --> 09:06.243
out of your face,
do you hear me?

09:06.245 --> 09:07.711
Do you hear me?
Yes.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.113
Good, now--

09:09.115 --> 09:11.215
I'm going to pull my Model A
around the back

09:11.217 --> 09:12.716
while you bag
this son of a bitch up.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.252
Then you are going to help me
load him into the automobile.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.655
And if you breathe a word
of this to the press out there,

09:17.657 --> 09:19.757
so help me God, I will come up
in here with an axe

09:19.759 --> 09:22.559
I will split your ass in two
like a Granny Smith apple.

09:22.561 --> 09:24.662
Do you understand me?
Yes!

09:24.664 --> 09:25.929
Good.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.865
The Governor's had a bad day.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.467
I don't want him seeing any
of this shit.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.903
Bag that evidence with it too.

09:34.172 --> 09:35.739
I've had a bad day too.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.743
<i>Doctor Bender
to the mental ward, please.</i>

09:40.345 --> 09:43.414
I don't know if I could spend
the rest of my life

09:43.416 --> 09:45.716
in that goddamn thingy.

09:45.718 --> 09:46.583
I know, sweetie.

09:46.585 --> 09:49.019
When we get out of here,
I say we get a second opinion

09:49.021 --> 09:51.155
about attaching Louis's legs
to your body.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.524
<i>FDR, FDR, FDR...</i>

09:53.526 --> 09:55.025
What the hell is that?

09:55.027 --> 09:56.026
FDR, FDR...

09:56.028 --> 09:58.195
Looks like a crowd
is gathered outside.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.898
And they're holding signs
for you--

10:00.900 --> 10:02.466
to run for President,

10:02.468 --> 10:05.402
FDR, FDR, FDR...

10:07.739 --> 10:09.039
among other things.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.474
Hey, Frank, you got a minute?

10:10.476 --> 10:12.009
Yeah, sure-- what the hell's
going on out there.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.812
It's pandemonium, people are
going shit house, Frank.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.280
You're all over the news.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.514
We got to get you
out there, boss.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.450
Let the people know
you're all right.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.818
I can't.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.152
At least not in that thing.

10:22.154 --> 10:25.823
Mr. Roosevelt, there's someone out
here that would like to see you.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.926
Unless it's your identical twin,
not right now.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.495
It's a ten-year-old boy, Timmy.

10:31.497 --> 10:33.831
He's stricken with polio.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.065
Werewolf attack?

10:35.067 --> 10:37.000
No, he had a prolonged virus

10:37.002 --> 10:38.135
in his intestinal track.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.137
Well, mine's kind of braver--
sorry.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.707
Frank.
Oh, all right, I'll see him.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.642
God.

10:49.414 --> 10:50.981
Hi, Mr. Roosevelt.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.784
Please call me Governor.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.819
Okay, Gov, Gov, Governor.

10:55.821 --> 10:59.156
Oh, Jesus, is polio going to
make me stutter too?

10:59.158 --> 11:01.191
Oh, no, that's a separate
problem

11:01.193 --> 11:02.693
he's dealing with, as well.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.228
Oh, thank God.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.998
Wha-- why aren't you
in a wheelchair?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.167
Well, Tommy,
Timmy.

11:10.169 --> 11:14.204
Timmy, I uh...

11:19.611 --> 11:23.180
I was just waiting for you
to come in

11:23.182 --> 11:25.983
and push it to me.

11:26.718 --> 11:27.818
Did you hear that, son?

11:27.820 --> 11:30.921
Bring the Governor
his wheelchair.

11:40.198 --> 11:42.032
Independent.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.201
There you go.

11:52.310 --> 11:58.549
Well, now we're
twi, twi, twi, twins.

11:59.684 --> 12:01.585
Thanks for taking the time,
Governor.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.020
It sure means a lot to him.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.421
I bet it does.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.322
Well, hmm,

12:05.324 --> 12:08.258
take care of yourself, Tommy-- Timmy.
Timmy.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.929
And why don't you drop
by the mansion

12:11.931 --> 12:17.167
on the sixth Tuesday in July
and we'll have a catch?

12:18.403 --> 12:20.938
Thank you.
Yes.

12:22.674 --> 12:27.578
Are you going
to run for President,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.179
Mr. Roosevelt?

12:29.181 --> 12:34.885
You're the only one
who can save us.

12:38.556 --> 12:43.193
FDR, FDR, FDR...

12:51.069 --> 12:53.503
Are you sure you want
to do this, Frank?

12:53.505 --> 12:54.771
I'm sure.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.474
I've got it from here.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.609
How you feeling, Governor?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.944
Like a one dollar bill,
never better.

13:01.813 --> 13:03.914
What was it like being attacked
by a werewolf?

13:03.916 --> 13:05.249
About the same
as having your money

13:05.251 --> 13:08.151
in the stock market,
these days.

13:10.421 --> 13:11.321
Hey, Governor Roosevelt,

13:11.323 --> 13:14.758
there hasn't been a werewolf
attack on a public figure

13:14.760 --> 13:17.461
since Abraham Lincoln in 1860.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.595
Why now?

13:18.597 --> 13:19.529
Ask him.

13:19.531 --> 13:21.064
Oh, no, wait-- head blown off.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.166
Almost forgot about that.

13:24.469 --> 13:27.738
But who am I kidding?
I'm not any better.

13:28.706 --> 13:31.408
Marco... polio.

13:33.211 --> 13:35.712
Hey, all kidding aside,
Mr. Roosevelt, Yep.

13:35.714 --> 13:37.414
you plan on running
for President?

13:37.416 --> 13:38.715
And if you win,
how will it feel

13:38.717 --> 13:41.618
to be the first invalid
ever elected?

13:42.453 --> 13:44.888
Gee, Bob, if I had known you
were going to try to fuck me,

13:44.890 --> 13:48.625
I would have had the hospital
dress me in a nicer gown.

13:49.727 --> 13:52.930
Men are not prisoners
of their fate.

13:52.932 --> 13:57.501
They are only prisoners
of their own mind.

13:57.503 --> 14:02.940
And I will not allow you
to rape the prisoner

14:02.942 --> 14:05.876
inside my mind.

14:06.678 --> 14:08.812
And as far as invalids go--

14:08.814 --> 14:13.150
oh, hell, the conservatives
in this country

14:13.152 --> 14:15.819
have been invalids for years.

14:16.487 --> 14:17.587
He's got that right.

14:17.589 --> 14:21.792
I view this werewolf attack
not as an attack against me,

14:21.794 --> 14:23.627
but an attack
against our nation.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.863
And I will fight the problems
of this nation

14:26.865 --> 14:28.832
with the same tenacity
that I used

14:28.834 --> 14:31.435
to take down
that vicious beast.

14:32.503 --> 14:36.239
So, today I toss my hat
into the ring

14:36.241 --> 14:39.343
with the Democratic Party
to be the next President

14:39.345 --> 14:42.245
of the United States.

14:43.414 --> 14:46.183
God bless America.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.319
FDR, FDR, FDR...

14:52.190 --> 14:53.824
How was that?
It was good.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.926
The part about the prisoner
was a little weird.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.695
I was freestyling, son.

14:58.697 --> 14:59.896
Oh, Frank!

14:59.898 --> 15:01.898
Mrs. Roosevelt,
you're going to have to sit

15:01.900 --> 15:03.633
up front on Franklin's lap.

15:03.635 --> 15:04.801
Ooh.

15:04.803 --> 15:05.402
Why?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.671
Because there's a dead werewolf
in the trunk.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.740
I'll explain later.

15:15.146 --> 15:16.680
Did you debrief him?

15:16.682 --> 15:17.681
Yes.
Cool.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.816
I hate when I have to take
his boxers off.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.618
Is he in bed?
Yes.

15:21.620 --> 15:22.486
Where are you going?

15:22.488 --> 15:25.889
I'm going to sleep
in the guest bedroom.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.558
Do you really think
he should be alone right now?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.227
I can't--

15:30.229 --> 15:32.329
It's just--

15:33.031 --> 15:34.164
His legs--

15:34.166 --> 15:37.467
They're shriveled-up
like two-day-old hot dogs.

15:37.469 --> 15:40.504
I don't want them
touching me.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.271
Eleanor,

15:41.273 --> 15:44.174
He is running for the Presidency
of the United States.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.543
You are his wife
and a potential first lady.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.944
So, what are you saying?

15:47.946 --> 15:50.881
What I'm saying is you have got
to get your shit together!

15:50.883 --> 15:51.948
Not just for Frank,

15:51.950 --> 15:54.584
but for the good of the whole
country, do you hear me?

15:54.586 --> 15:55.719
Yes.

15:55.721 --> 15:56.720
A divorce will blow his chances

15:56.722 --> 15:59.056
right out of the water
and that just can't happen.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.124
There's too much at stake.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.125
We think

16:02.127 --> 16:04.294
there might still be more...

16:05.730 --> 16:07.931
werewolves out there.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.266
Are you serious?

16:09.268 --> 16:13.336
I thought that was
an isolated attack.

16:13.338 --> 16:14.938
We still don't know.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.640
Oh.
Look,

16:16.642 --> 16:18.442
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

16:18.444 --> 16:19.743
Get some sleep.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.678
Oh.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.213
<i>Yes.</i>

16:23.215 --> 16:24.748
How you feeling, Frank?

16:24.750 --> 16:25.615
Not too bad, actually.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.684
Just getting used to getting
in and out of that chair.

16:27.686 --> 16:31.254
Crawling into bed here, I was
as nervous as a 10-year-old

16:31.256 --> 16:33.824
in a whore house.
I bet.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.591
So,

16:34.593 --> 16:38.295
Eleanor is tending
to the kids?

16:38.297 --> 16:41.164
Yeah, she's probably
going to spend the night

16:41.166 --> 16:42.699
with them tonight--
keep an eye on them.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.501
They've had a pretty big scare.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.369
They have? Shit, look at these!
Oh!

16:46.371 --> 16:48.572
Frank, you've got to stop
doing that.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.408
Here's the paper, by the way.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.876
Thank you.

16:52.878 --> 16:54.177
Let's see.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.614
Oh, American hero
and werewolf killer,

16:57.616 --> 16:58.615
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

16:58.617 --> 17:00.851
announces he's running
for President.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.852
Thank you, mm-hmm.

17:01.854 --> 17:07.523
I hope it mentions something
about my cock still working.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.290
No.

17:08.292 --> 17:09.459
Well, shit, call them up!

17:09.461 --> 17:11.694
I want a press release
first thing in the morning.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.296
Before we do that--
But--

17:13.298 --> 17:14.498
let's leak them a picture too.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.366
Before we do that, I have
something to discuss with you.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.236
I don't think there's anything
more important than this.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.404
It's about the dead werewolf.

17:21.406 --> 17:24.374
Stuff it-- hang it
over the mantle.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.942
Put it in the kids' room.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.243
This is serious, Frank.

17:27.246 --> 17:28.812
The doctors ran some tests
and they think

17:28.814 --> 17:31.481
the werewolf might have come
from Germany.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.350
What?

17:33.352 --> 17:34.151
Yeah.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.318
They found some markings
on it

17:35.320 --> 17:37.621
and some literature
next to the body.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.723
German...

17:39.725 --> 17:41.191
why?

17:41.193 --> 17:41.858
I don't know.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.261
But don't you think it's odd
that the last attack

17:44.263 --> 17:47.063
was on Abraham Lincoln
before he ran for President?

17:47.065 --> 17:49.065
The only thing I find odd

17:49.067 --> 17:50.834
is that there's no--

17:50.836 --> 17:51.701
I'm serious, Frank.

17:51.703 --> 17:55.605
I'm serious too, Lou,
I am serious!

17:57.175 --> 17:58.308
All right, what should we do?

17:58.310 --> 17:59.976
Should we call up the FBI
and have them--

17:59.978 --> 18:02.112
No, no, no, I don't want Hoover
to be using

18:02.114 --> 18:04.881
any bullshit German propaganda
against you in the election.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.250
We'll just
get you elected first,

18:07.252 --> 18:08.652
then we'll let them have
a look at the wolf.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.721
In the meantime, I'll beef up
security on the campaign trail.

18:11.723 --> 18:12.956
That's a good idea,
thank you, Lou.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.425
Just keep the kids
out of the meat freezer

18:15.427 --> 18:17.827
for a couple of months

18:17.829 --> 18:18.995
Oh, Lou,

18:18.997 --> 18:19.829
Yeah.

18:19.831 --> 18:21.231
Cancel my soccer camp tomorrow.

18:21.233 --> 18:25.135
I don't think
I'm going to be any good.

18:26.370 --> 18:29.706
Oh, fuck you.

18:58.169 --> 19:00.203
Pleasure.

19:00.205 --> 19:01.104
Yes.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.005
Here we go, there we go.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.774
Excuse me, would you sign
my newspaper?

19:04.776 --> 19:06.109
And does it work?

19:06.111 --> 19:10.113
Damn straight-- the answer
to both those questions.

19:11.148 --> 19:12.749
Thank you.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.484
Thank you.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.686
Lou.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.722
Hey.

19:24.795 --> 19:27.764
So, he reads the sign,
he gets all pissed off,

19:27.766 --> 19:31.201
throws down his pickax
and helmet and starts to leave.

19:31.203 --> 19:35.605
Well, she-- she runs
out of the brothel naked

19:35.607 --> 19:39.142
and says, "No, we don't serve
minors.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.145
You, sir, look well over 18."

19:54.559 --> 19:56.026
And we go.

19:56.028 --> 20:00.463
Oh, I'm exhausted
and I can't even stand up.

20:00.465 --> 20:03.867
God bless you guys.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.669
Keep laughing, boys.

20:05.671 --> 20:08.505
You think God blessed Tommy?

20:08.507 --> 20:10.974
Hold on, fellows.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.108
Who's Tommy?

20:12.110 --> 20:16.846
Tommy-- Tommy used to work
on the docks.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.815
Unions been on strike,

20:18.817 --> 20:20.550
down on his luck.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.852
It's tough.

20:22.854 --> 20:25.522
So tough.

20:26.724 --> 20:28.091
What happened to him?

20:28.093 --> 20:32.696
Got so depressed,
he tried to off himself.

20:33.964 --> 20:37.267
And who's taking care of him?

20:37.269 --> 20:38.968
His wife, Gina.

20:38.970 --> 20:42.405
Gina works the diner all day.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.542
Working for--

20:45.910 --> 20:48.511
Come over here,
come over here!

20:48.513 --> 20:52.082
Sit on Uncle Frankie's lap.

20:53.617 --> 20:57.387
Okay, sh-hhh.

20:57.988 --> 21:00.557
Your Uncle Delano's going to fix
this shit.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.258
You guys are the salt
of the earth.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.994
The real people who make
this country run.

21:04.996 --> 21:08.932
And I am not going to leave you

21:08.934 --> 21:10.967
to live on a prayer!

21:34.458 --> 21:36.192
Beautiful melons, mam.

21:36.194 --> 21:38.294
They sure are ripe
for the picking.

21:38.296 --> 21:39.829
I meant your tits.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.097
So did I.

21:41.099 --> 21:42.932
What in the hell is going on
down here?

21:42.934 --> 21:45.869
Okay, Frank, got to get there.
Yeah, yeah.

21:45.871 --> 21:50.707
Excuse me, were you ogling
at my wife's breasts?

21:50.709 --> 21:52.409
Mm-mm.

21:52.910 --> 21:54.077
I don't mind if you were.

21:54.079 --> 21:56.246
I just want to view it,
that's all.

21:56.248 --> 22:00.450
Congressman Cleavon Baybridge
Buford-- Repube, Georgia.

22:00.452 --> 22:01.985
Nice to meet you.
Yes, you too.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.653
Did you just say Repube?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.221
Mm-hmm, yes, sir.

22:05.223 --> 22:07.157
You mean Republican?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.458
No, sir.

22:08.460 --> 22:12.662
The form I filled out when I ran
for congress said Repube on it.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.564
It was a professional
form, sir.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.633
It was typed on paper--

22:16.635 --> 22:18.735
maybe even double-space.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.938
I think you meant Repub,
short for Republican.

22:21.940 --> 22:23.540
No, sir.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.475
I saved the form, sir.

22:25.477 --> 22:28.311
It is inside a folder
marked official on it.

22:28.313 --> 22:29.379
So, I know that it is real.

22:29.381 --> 22:32.182
Yes, but-- You're probably good then.
Let this one go, Frank.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.350
<i>Nice meeting you folks.
Oh, no stay for dinner.</i>

22:34.352 --> 22:38.188
We've got fried chicken
and fresh biscuits and okra.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.923
I'll go down on you all.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.091
It'll be a nice time.

22:42.093 --> 22:43.026
Excuse me?

22:43.028 --> 22:48.198
My cousin-- wife is excellent
at entertaining guests.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.201
And even though I am a Repube,

22:51.203 --> 22:53.570
it would be an honor to have
the next President

22:53.572 --> 22:56.506
of the United States
over to our house for dinner,

22:56.508 --> 22:58.708
possibly share our bed,

22:58.710 --> 23:01.811
even if he is a Democrat.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.648
No, we have a long campaign
ahead of us.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.450
I don't think it's the--

23:07.452 --> 23:09.319
Sir, I can assure you

23:09.321 --> 23:12.856
that this is
a house where wolves

23:14.925 --> 23:18.027
will not attack us.

23:18.496 --> 23:20.430
Plus, I got some moonshine

23:20.432 --> 23:22.799
which does not taste
like asshole grease.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.168
Sold!

23:25.170 --> 23:26.236
So I said to her

23:26.238 --> 23:29.205
keep your back straight,
knees bent,

23:29.207 --> 23:30.240
feet shoulder-width apart,

23:30.242 --> 23:33.176
and keep your strokes
to a minimum.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.712
Well, she can't golf
worth a shit

23:35.714 --> 23:38.781
but she can give
a hell of a blow job.

23:38.783 --> 23:39.616
It's true.

23:39.618 --> 23:42.986
I'm looking at a big handicap
right now.

23:42.988 --> 23:46.189
Ahhh, Cleavon,

23:46.191 --> 23:50.693
so why do they call
this town Warm Springs?

23:51.362 --> 23:52.495
Oh, Legend has it

23:52.497 --> 23:56.666
that whenever a young Injun girl

23:56.668 --> 23:59.469
becomes a woman,

23:59.471 --> 24:02.138
you know, down there,

24:02.140 --> 24:05.875
she will race toward the springs

24:05.877 --> 24:08.444
and jump inside the water

24:08.446 --> 24:13.783
and begin her menstruation
process.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.286
It is said that the blood

24:16.288 --> 24:19.422
collectively joining together

24:19.424 --> 24:23.793
creates a natural warmth

24:23.795 --> 24:25.795
that gives a man a feeling

24:25.797 --> 24:31.601
as if he is back inside
a womb again.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.469
It will invigorate him

24:33.471 --> 24:34.837
and cause him to do things

24:34.839 --> 24:39.676
that he could only do
when he was a fetus.

24:42.179 --> 24:44.581
Is that true?

24:48.352 --> 24:49.819
Is what true, sir?

24:49.821 --> 24:52.822
The story you just told.

24:52.824 --> 24:57.527
I am sorry,
I am quite inebriated

24:57.529 --> 25:01.064
and I was unaware that I was
speaking out loud just now.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.932
I am shamed.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.802
Who want dessert?

25:05.804 --> 25:08.438
We got peach cobbler,
rhubarb pie,

25:08.440 --> 25:12.141
some southern
strawberry jam cake, and--

25:12.143 --> 25:14.744
Excuse me, this doesn't
seem appropriate.

25:14.746 --> 25:15.912
What is that, sir?

25:15.914 --> 25:18.348
A black slave walking in
with a chalkboard

25:18.350 --> 25:20.683
around his neck
with dessert choices on it.

25:20.685 --> 25:24.153
It seems a little... racist.

25:24.688 --> 25:27.924
These kind people
have taken me in,

25:27.926 --> 25:30.360
given me an education,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.695
shared their bed with me,

25:32.697 --> 25:35.164
given me food,

25:35.166 --> 25:37.467
and you have the nerve

25:37.469 --> 25:39.302
to call them racist.

25:39.304 --> 25:40.269
How dare you, sir?

25:40.271 --> 25:44.273
I have merely been falling
behind on my writing,

25:44.275 --> 25:47.543
so I asked if I may use
the chalkboard

25:47.545 --> 25:48.878
to further my spelling,

25:48.880 --> 25:50.513
and I have to deal with this?

25:50.515 --> 25:51.447
I'm sorry, I--

25:51.449 --> 25:55.585
I shall leave two incongruent
pieces of Georgia pine

25:55.587 --> 25:56.586
next to your bed

25:56.588 --> 26:00.189
in case you want to transfix
them together with twine

26:00.191 --> 26:01.758
and light them ablaze

26:01.760 --> 26:04.961
to make you feel at home, sir!

26:04.963 --> 26:06.496
I didn't mean anything.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.931
May I be excused, sir?

26:08.933 --> 26:09.999
Yes, sure, Curtis.

26:10.001 --> 26:14.337
I shall be in the garden
playing basketball,

26:14.339 --> 26:16.339
should anyone need me.

26:20.577 --> 26:22.211
So, Mr. Roosevelt,

26:22.213 --> 26:25.148
may I escort you out
to the springs?

26:25.150 --> 26:27.917
I think that you will find them
quite delightful.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.619
I know that I do.

26:29.621 --> 26:32.288
Well, I think that would be
quite pleasant.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.623
Mmm, Mrs. Buford,

26:33.625 --> 26:35.491
will you show our esteemed
guest, Louis,

26:35.493 --> 26:37.360
where our extra bathing
suits are?

26:37.362 --> 26:39.162
Oh, that won't be necessary.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.431
I like to be choked.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.899
Mmm, indeed, sir.

26:42.901 --> 26:46.202
Ah, this is remarkable,
I feel so invigorated.

26:46.204 --> 26:51.207
It's like I have full movement
in my extremities again.

26:51.209 --> 26:52.942
Kick your little old
legs, Frank.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.777
Kick your little old legs.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.313
Oh, yeah.

26:58.682 --> 27:00.049
Legend has it

27:00.051 --> 27:04.654
that the Injuns used to come
here to hide from werewolves.

27:04.656 --> 27:10.226
Seems the wolves hate
warm water.

27:12.129 --> 27:12.995
Is that real?

27:12.997 --> 27:17.033
Because earlier you told me
another story about this place.

27:17.035 --> 27:18.367
Mm?

27:18.369 --> 27:22.138
I'm sorry, was I speaking
out loud again?

27:22.140 --> 27:22.739
Yes.

27:22.741 --> 27:27.343
God, shit, sometimes I think
that I am silent

27:27.345 --> 27:30.980
when these thoughts
just flow between my lips.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.149
I'm seeing a specialist
about it.

27:33.151 --> 27:37.420
Anywho, my doctor recommended
that I come here

27:37.422 --> 27:41.491
to relieve my polio
after my attack.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.693
What?

27:43.695 --> 27:45.895
Well, you were attacked too?

27:45.897 --> 27:47.930
Mm-hmm, yes, sir--

27:47.932 --> 27:49.198
up in the Appalachian Mountains.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.603
I had taken my nephew, Jimmy,
Jimmy Carter,

27:53.605 --> 27:55.171
on a camping trip.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.808
Well, in the middle of the night

27:58.810 --> 28:00.777
I had awoken

28:00.779 --> 28:03.146
to relieve myself with my hands.

28:03.148 --> 28:06.449
When, all of a sudden,
out of the corner of my eye

28:06.451 --> 28:09.585
I noticed this werewolf

28:09.587 --> 28:10.653
running through the trees

28:10.655 --> 28:13.956
over to the tent,
trying to kill him.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.795
Uncle Cleavon, Uncle Cleavon.

28:18.797 --> 28:20.229
And what did he do?

28:20.231 --> 28:21.964
Well, instincts kick in
at that point.

28:21.966 --> 28:25.935
And I do the only thing that Cleavon
Baybridge Buford knows how to do,

28:25.937 --> 28:28.037
which is to sprint
over to the tent,

28:28.039 --> 28:31.140
pull out a small sterling
silver cheese knife

28:31.142 --> 28:33.543
I keep tucked inside my pants
at all times,

28:33.545 --> 28:36.846
and kill that son of a bitch
dead on the spot.

28:36.848 --> 28:40.550
That, sir, was unnecessary.

28:42.052 --> 28:45.788
And you are dead, sir.

28:50.227 --> 28:51.027
Damn.

28:51.029 --> 28:55.364
Well, I got a mild case
of the polio--

28:55.366 --> 28:57.166
enough that I can walk
with a cane

28:57.168 --> 29:01.437
as long as I have plenty
of Georgia peaches. Ah.

29:02.739 --> 29:04.440
Peaches?

29:04.442 --> 29:06.275
Mm-hmm.

29:07.477 --> 29:11.380
Peaches, meet the next President
of the United States,

29:11.382 --> 29:13.583
Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.819
Much obliged, sir.
Mam.

29:17.688 --> 29:19.589
I didn't touch your wife.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.556
Oh, that's okay.

29:20.558 --> 29:24.961
Our votes are swing,
if you know what I mean.

29:30.133 --> 29:31.934
Let's enjoy the springs,
shall we?

29:31.936 --> 29:36.439
Here, here.
Enjoy the springs.

29:38.175 --> 29:40.142
This, sir,
was a pleasure.

29:40.144 --> 29:42.011
Well, the pleasure
was all mine.

29:42.013 --> 29:43.679
And mine-- twice.

29:43.681 --> 29:44.747
Thanks, Mrs. Buford.

29:44.749 --> 29:45.915
You're mighty welcome, boys.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.350
You all come back soon,
now, you hear.

29:47.352 --> 29:49.619
And good luck on the rest
of the campaign.

29:49.621 --> 29:54.056
Just know that this Repube
will be voting for you.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.658
Cleavon, if I win,

29:55.660 --> 29:57.426
how would you like
to come down to Washington

29:57.428 --> 29:59.762
and serve
as my vice president...

30:03.600 --> 30:05.434
of the hot tub committee.

30:05.436 --> 30:06.969
Are you serious, sir?

30:06.971 --> 30:09.171
Yes, we can always use
a good Repube

30:09.173 --> 30:11.340
like you on the other side
of the aisle.

30:11.342 --> 30:14.243
Sir, you have no idea

30:14.245 --> 30:17.013
how much this would mean to me.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.081
When I was a little boy,

30:19.083 --> 30:21.784
I put a magic hat on a snowman.

30:21.786 --> 30:23.953
And he came to life.

30:23.955 --> 30:27.556
I blacked out, I got all dizzy

30:27.558 --> 30:29.859
and fell over on the ground.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.061
And when I came to,

30:32.063 --> 30:33.396
I looked up

30:33.398 --> 30:36.365
and the sky was filled
with different colors.

30:36.367 --> 30:40.603
We were flying
through the air together,

30:41.338 --> 30:43.372
kicking our little legs.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.708
We were free.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.410
We were free.

30:47.412 --> 30:51.614
I have that same feeling
right now, sir.

30:54.685 --> 30:55.952
Just say, "yes."

30:55.954 --> 30:58.187
Yes-- yes, sir.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.121
Yes, sir.

30:59.123 --> 31:01.357
And sir, don't worry--

31:01.359 --> 31:03.960
we will get you
the great State of Georgia.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.161
I can promise you that, sir.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.030
Even though this is a State
filled with Repubes,

31:08.032 --> 31:11.634
I will take my wife
to every single town.

31:11.636 --> 31:15.838
She and I will suck
as many dicks as it takes

31:15.840 --> 31:17.740
to get these votes, sir.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.842
That's how much you mean to me.

31:19.844 --> 31:23.479
The experiences we had together,

31:23.481 --> 31:27.350
I will never forget.

31:28.585 --> 31:30.286
Just being friends, you know?

31:30.288 --> 31:31.220
Not in a gay way,

31:31.222 --> 31:34.557
just another politician,
you know?

31:34.559 --> 31:37.994
Just shared
a warm bath together.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.196
I will go door-to-door

31:40.198 --> 31:41.897
and ask each and every person

31:41.899 --> 31:45.201
to have a heart
and vote for FDR.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.570
I will do that, sir.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.239
I will do that.

31:52.275 --> 31:53.209
Love the guy--

31:53.211 --> 31:55.211
crazier than shit,
but I love him.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.113
Thank you, sir.

32:29.379 --> 32:32.248
<i>And the results
are slowly coming in.</i>

32:32.250 --> 32:33.449
<i>Here is what we know, so far--</i>

32:33.451 --> 32:37.086
<i>Hoover has won Pennsylvania,
New Hampshire, Vermont,</i>

32:37.088 --> 32:39.488
<i>Delaware, and Connecticut.</i>

32:39.490 --> 32:40.256
Ooh.

32:40.258 --> 32:41.457
<i>Roosevelt has managed to secure</i>

32:41.459 --> 32:45.194
<i>New York, New Jersey, Virginia,
Tennessee, and Georgia.</i>

32:45.196 --> 32:48.798
Hah, hah!
Good old Cleavon Buford,

32:48.800 --> 32:49.965
that son of a bitch did it!

32:49.967 --> 32:53.669
I'll bet Mrs. Buford
carried a few favors too.

32:53.671 --> 32:55.037
Who?

32:55.039 --> 32:56.772
A Congressman we met--

32:56.774 --> 32:59.275
and his wife, lovely people.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.509
Southern.

33:00.511 --> 33:01.644
<i>Two more States have come in--</i>

33:01.646 --> 33:06.248
<i>North and South Carolina
are for Roosevelt.</i>

33:06.250 --> 33:07.683
Yow!
Ah.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.218
Daddy! Daddy!

33:09.220 --> 33:10.820
I have great news.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.388
Being gay is not
great news, James.

33:12.390 --> 33:13.656
We are listening
to the results

33:13.658 --> 33:17.059
to see if your father
is going to be President.

33:17.061 --> 33:18.727
That's just it-- he won.

33:18.729 --> 33:20.229
He won!

33:20.231 --> 33:21.430
Hoover only carried six States.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.165
You carried the rest
of the country.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.267
If you're sniffing glue again,

33:25.269 --> 33:29.171
I swear to God I'll beat you
with a fat man's belt

33:29.173 --> 33:30.873
and wheel over you repeatedly

33:30.875 --> 33:33.709
until you bleed
out of your eyes, nose and ears.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.644
<i>More State results are in--</i>

33:35.646 --> 33:38.981
<i>Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Nebraska--</i>

33:38.983 --> 33:42.585
<i>my God, man, every other State
except for Maine</i>

33:42.587 --> 33:44.753
<i>has gone to Roosevelt.</i>

34:36.806 --> 34:42.244
Now, I am the most powerful man
in the world!

34:42.246 --> 34:45.414
Suck it, bitches!

34:53.723 --> 34:55.257
You can't walk.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.594
I can't walk, I forgot.

35:00.830 --> 35:04.767
Mr. President, secret service
agent, Dan Ru-- therford.

35:06.136 --> 35:08.804
What... the... fuck?

35:08.806 --> 35:10.272
Oh, shit.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.842
What is wrong with you people?

35:13.844 --> 35:17.346
Get it together, man.

35:18.348 --> 35:20.783
I'm just fucking with you.

35:20.785 --> 35:24.687
Woodrow Wilson did the same shit
when he was elected.

35:24.689 --> 35:25.888
I knew it, I knew it!

35:25.890 --> 35:30.993
But you should tell your son
to stop crapping in that vase.

35:30.995 --> 35:33.662
That's pretty messed up, man.

35:34.397 --> 35:34.897
James.

35:34.899 --> 35:37.700
I'll give you 15 minutes
to collect yourselves.

35:37.702 --> 35:42.071
Then I need to get you to
the White House, Mr. President.

35:42.073 --> 35:43.906
Mr. President.

35:43.908 --> 35:46.609
Mr. President.
Yes!

35:46.611 --> 35:50.312
Wipe yourself, James,
wipe yourself.

36:14.771 --> 36:19.408
<i>And it's official-- the new
President of the United States</i>

36:19.410 --> 36:21.744
<i>is Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</i>

36:21.746 --> 36:22.911
Nein!

36:22.913 --> 36:24.747
Turn that scheisse off.

36:24.749 --> 36:27.349
I was afraid
this would happen.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.718
Get Mussolini on the phone,
schnell!

36:29.720 --> 36:31.920
Right away, Fuhrer.

36:34.592 --> 36:37.760
<i>Rachel Ray's Beach
at Broadway and 7th location.</i>

36:37.762 --> 36:39.395
What! What the fuck?

36:39.397 --> 36:41.463
<i>Whoa, hey,
this is America, Jack.</i>

36:41.465 --> 36:42.298
<i>Who is this?</i>

36:42.300 --> 36:44.266
<i>I'll come down there
and I'll get your fucking--</i>

36:44.268 --> 36:47.202
Sorry, Fuhrer,
wrong Italian.

36:47.204 --> 36:48.604
That is a take-out place
in New York

36:48.606 --> 36:52.174
that is quite delightful--
thin slices, crispy crust

36:52.176 --> 36:54.310
but not overdone, it's--

37:00.217 --> 37:03.118
Mussolini, it's the fuhrer.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.219
Yah, heil me.

37:04.221 --> 37:05.187
Did you hear
the news?

37:05.189 --> 37:07.189
I heard all about that shit.

37:07.191 --> 37:10.726
We should have taken him out
when we had the chance.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.128
I sent my best man
to take him out

37:13.130 --> 37:14.830
before he decided
to run.

37:14.832 --> 37:18.434
But the polio only spread
to his legs.

37:18.436 --> 37:19.868
What about the cock?

37:19.870 --> 37:20.936
It still work?

37:20.938 --> 37:23.739
Jah.
Ah, shit!

37:23.741 --> 37:27.142
The last thing we need
is a big swinging dick

37:27.144 --> 37:28.377
in the White House

37:28.379 --> 37:30.612
trying to fuck up
a whole world takeover.

37:30.614 --> 37:34.049
You are preaching
to the gas chamber on this one.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.818
We already lost Franz.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.252
Okay, hold the phone,

37:37.254 --> 37:39.388
I'm going to get Hirohito
on a 3-way.

37:39.390 --> 37:42.157
Get me Hirohito
on a 3-way.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.662
<i>Hirohito's on 61st
and Madison.</i>

37:46.664 --> 37:47.629
Hello, who?

37:47.631 --> 37:49.898
<i>Hirohito's dry cleaner
on 61st and Madison.</i>

37:49.900 --> 37:52.167
What's the matter you?

37:52.169 --> 37:53.869
Hey.
I'm so sorry, boss.

37:53.871 --> 37:57.840
That's a dry cleaning place
I send out to in New York

37:57.842 --> 37:58.807
for my uniform.

37:58.809 --> 38:00.709
Perfect amount of starch--

38:00.711 --> 38:03.679
not too much, not too little--

38:03.681 --> 38:07.449
Hitler, is it too much to ask
to have a decent assistant

38:07.451 --> 38:08.951
hate America like me?

38:08.953 --> 38:11.820
Tell me about it.

38:14.224 --> 38:15.624
Hello.

38:15.626 --> 38:19.995
Hirohito, it's Moosie
and Hitler.

38:19.997 --> 38:25.467
Ooh, you using that new 3-way
switchboard technology

38:25.469 --> 38:27.136
my scientists invented.

38:27.138 --> 38:31.507
I told you the Japanese
were good at electronics.

38:31.509 --> 38:33.208
Yeah, you also make
a nice car

38:33.210 --> 38:36.412
but better
you no drive, huh?

38:37.614 --> 38:39.415
That's funny.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.417
You heard about FDR?

38:41.419 --> 38:42.985
He got elected.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.052
Of course, I did.

38:44.054 --> 38:45.521
And I'm not happy
about it!

38:45.523 --> 38:49.658
Hitler, you were supposed
to take care of him.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.926
If this is going to be
one of those

38:50.928 --> 38:54.163
gang-up-on-Hitler calls,
I'm out.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.964
I say we go to war.

38:55.966 --> 38:56.899
Okay, not yet.

38:56.901 --> 39:01.103
I'm going to send my mafia
guys over to America.

39:01.105 --> 39:03.105
And they're going to handle
this problem

39:03.107 --> 39:03.972
and make it disappear.

39:03.974 --> 39:06.842
I'm going to pollute
the whole country.

39:06.844 --> 39:10.279
And how do you plan
on doing that?

39:10.281 --> 39:11.113
Prohibition.

39:11.115 --> 39:13.715
You see, these guys
still bootleg

39:13.717 --> 39:14.917
my fine Italian wine.

39:14.919 --> 39:19.288
So, I'm going to take
my werewolf blood

39:19.290 --> 39:21.757
and I'm going to stick it
in my wine

39:21.759 --> 39:23.425
everybody drink in America.

39:23.427 --> 39:26.862
Then everybody going to be
like us--

39:26.864 --> 39:27.930
a werewolf.

39:27.932 --> 39:31.133
FDR, he going to have
no chance.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.534
I'll make
that whole country

39:32.536 --> 39:36.472
- howling at the moon.
- Yes, jawohl, I like it.

39:36.474 --> 39:39.942
I'll give some of mein fine
German beer

39:39.944 --> 39:41.844
to take, as well, huh?

39:41.846 --> 39:43.879
Me like it too.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.147
Count me in.

39:45.149 --> 39:48.650
We will donate sake.

39:48.652 --> 39:49.418
Sake?

39:49.420 --> 39:53.422
Sake is for women
und the gay community.

39:54.724 --> 39:57.259
Laugh it up, bitches!

39:57.261 --> 39:59.862
Sake is a sensual drink

39:59.864 --> 40:04.199
that relaxes the mind,
body, and--

40:06.369 --> 40:08.704
That's so funny.
Fine!

40:08.706 --> 40:10.772
Fuck you!

40:10.774 --> 40:12.274
3-way done!

40:12.276 --> 40:14.376
Pull it!

40:25.755 --> 40:28.223
Mr. President, may I present
to you, George Freeman,

40:28.225 --> 40:31.426
the official White House butler.
It's an honor, sir.

40:31.428 --> 40:32.494
Freeman, Mother.

40:32.496 --> 40:34.830
Yes, sir.
Kind of ironic, isn't it?

40:34.832 --> 40:37.032
I guess so.

40:37.433 --> 40:41.236
Well, we're going to set
this motherfucker off, George.

40:41.238 --> 40:43.071
Pound my shit!

40:43.339 --> 40:45.107
There's some weed
in Washington's humidor--

40:45.109 --> 40:46.842
third drawer down on the right,
good stuff--

40:46.844 --> 40:48.510
no sticks, no stems, no seeds.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.112
My negro.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.547
Literally.

40:51.549 --> 40:52.915
Mr. President,
may I present to you

40:52.917 --> 40:55.183
White House secretary,
Miss Melissa Ricksman.

40:55.185 --> 40:56.852
Mr. President,
anything you need,

40:56.854 --> 40:58.453
anything at all,
don't hesitate to ask.

40:58.455 --> 41:02.824
Anything you dictate,
I will transcribe.

41:02.826 --> 41:05.027
My dictate works just fine.

41:05.029 --> 41:06.762
I mean my dick,

41:06.764 --> 41:08.263
if I was going to dictate
something,

41:08.265 --> 41:11.867
I would talk directly
to the American citizens.

41:11.869 --> 41:14.469
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm not understanding.

41:14.471 --> 41:17.406
You are going to talk
to them directly,

41:17.408 --> 41:19.975
as in town gatherings?

41:19.977 --> 41:22.177
No, what I mean is--
George, how are you with radios?

41:22.179 --> 41:23.679
I'm black, son.
Cool!

41:23.681 --> 41:25.013
Then rig that bitch up--

41:25.015 --> 41:27.482
so I can speak
directly through it

41:27.484 --> 41:29.051
to the entire nation.

41:29.053 --> 41:31.186
Cool.

41:32.956 --> 41:34.656
Hat.

41:38.194 --> 41:40.395
Oh.

41:40.397 --> 41:42.097
There you go, sir.

41:42.099 --> 41:42.931
Right there.

41:42.933 --> 41:44.900
Check one-two, check one-two.

41:44.902 --> 41:46.768
Yo, turn me up
in the headphones.

41:46.770 --> 41:48.036
Your levels are proper, kid.

41:48.038 --> 41:51.306
Now, let me turn
this record player off.

41:51.741 --> 41:53.408
Ooh, shit, sorry guys.

41:53.410 --> 41:56.678
No, no, no, George,
keep doing that-- I like that.

41:56.680 --> 42:00.816
The Delano needs to chat
fireside up in this bitch.

42:00.818 --> 42:02.484
Let that beat right out.

42:02.486 --> 42:04.953
Franklin, I think
this is inappropriate.

42:04.955 --> 42:08.624
Shh, grown men conversing--
seen, not heard, Eleanor.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.460
George, keep scratching.

42:13.763 --> 42:16.398
My fellow Americans,

42:16.400 --> 42:20.669
<i>this is your new President,
Franklin</i>

42:20.671 --> 42:22.170
Delano Roosevelt,

42:22.172 --> 42:25.173
a.k.a. The Delano,

42:25.175 --> 42:26.642
<i>a.k.a.</i>

42:26.644 --> 42:29.277
Big Baby Juice Maker.

42:29.979 --> 42:33.582
And I'm chatting to you
live from the double O.

42:33.584 --> 42:34.483
First of all,

42:34.485 --> 42:38.720
I want to thank you for electing
me as your President.

42:38.722 --> 42:42.958
On the reels,
that was a smart play.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.092
Hoover was great.

42:44.094 --> 42:47.329
They'll probably name a dam
or a vacuum cleaner

42:47.331 --> 42:49.998
after him some day, but--

42:50.000 --> 42:52.501
he wasn't cut out

42:52.503 --> 42:55.771
for what lies ahead.

42:55.773 --> 42:58.573
I know times are hard.

42:59.108 --> 43:02.044
Some of you
are probably wondering

43:02.046 --> 43:03.045
where your next

43:03.047 --> 43:05.547
<i>meal is coming from, or</i>

43:05.549 --> 43:08.984
who your next employer
is going to be.

43:08.986 --> 43:09.718
Hey, hold my hole.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.787
Back of the line--
wait for the glory hole.

43:11.789 --> 43:13.689
You-- glory hole four.

43:13.691 --> 43:14.356
Shh, wait, wait.

43:14.358 --> 43:16.992
I got to hear what
he's got to say.

43:16.994 --> 43:17.793
Me too.

43:17.795 --> 43:19.161
<i>or even if you're
going to be able</i>

43:19.163 --> 43:22.297
<i>to buy your wife
flowers anymore.</i>

43:24.334 --> 43:25.267
James,

43:25.269 --> 43:27.569
stop crapping in that vase!

43:27.571 --> 43:28.804
Sorry, Manny.

43:28.806 --> 43:30.439
If your daddy wasn't President,

43:30.441 --> 43:33.408
I'd steam your chest
like I was Grover Cleveland.

43:33.410 --> 43:35.777
<i>I want you to rest assured</i>

43:35.779 --> 43:39.181
that The Delano
is going to handle shit.

43:39.183 --> 43:41.616
I've got a new deal for you.

43:41.618 --> 43:43.585
I vow

43:43.587 --> 43:45.754
to end the recession

43:45.756 --> 43:47.689
<i>and get every American</i>

43:47.691 --> 43:49.424
<i>working again.</i>

43:49.426 --> 43:50.926
How the hell's
he going to do that?

43:50.928 --> 43:54.196
<i>How the hell am I going
to do that, you ask?</i>

43:54.198 --> 43:55.363
<i>I'm going to</i>

43:55.365 --> 43:56.498
close our borders

43:56.500 --> 43:58.967
and block foreigners
from coming in

43:58.969 --> 44:01.403
and taking away jobs
from Americans.

44:01.405 --> 44:02.938
<i>I'm going to give incentives</i>

44:02.940 --> 44:06.408
<i>to farmers who provide us
with healthy food.</i>

44:06.410 --> 44:08.243
And last, but not least,

44:08.245 --> 44:12.581
I'm going to end prohibition.

44:12.583 --> 44:15.717
I want to be able to come home

44:15.719 --> 44:17.152
after a hard day's work

44:17.154 --> 44:19.821
and drink a glass
of whiskey and milk

44:19.823 --> 44:21.423
like a goddamn man!

44:21.425 --> 44:23.058
You hear that, darling?

44:23.060 --> 44:26.795
We don't have to make
toilet wine anymore.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.964
<i>Put the kiddies to sleep.</i>

44:28.966 --> 44:32.768
<i>Parents,
push your beds together.</i>

44:32.770 --> 44:34.870
And know when you wake up,

44:34.872 --> 44:39.474
you will wake up
to a new America.

44:39.476 --> 44:42.177
This is The Delano,

44:42.179 --> 44:43.945
signing off.

44:44.580 --> 44:46.248
God bless.

44:46.250 --> 44:49.918
You're off the air,
Mr. President.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.054
Jesus, Frank, what was that?

44:53.056 --> 44:55.190
I was freestyling again, son.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.458
Gangsta, wasn't it?

44:56.460 --> 44:59.561
Parents pushing
their beds together--

44:59.563 --> 45:01.296
that is disgusting.

45:01.298 --> 45:02.264
Oh, come on, Eleanor.

45:02.266 --> 45:03.799
I think by now
the American people

45:03.801 --> 45:06.835
know that babies do not
come from storks.

45:06.837 --> 45:08.336
Hell, we have six kids.

45:08.338 --> 45:11.373
Let's make a seventh
one, tonight.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.808
Ooh! Ooh!

45:12.810 --> 45:14.342
You're sick.

45:14.344 --> 45:17.012
I'm going to tend the children.

45:17.914 --> 45:20.749
I loved your speech,
Mr. President.

45:20.751 --> 45:22.918
Thank you.
I don't know, Frank,

45:22.920 --> 45:25.153
shutting down the borders,
ending prohibition.

45:25.155 --> 45:26.188
Sir, speaking of prohibition,

45:26.190 --> 45:28.490
I think there's something
you need to see--

45:28.492 --> 45:31.026
the FBI would like to have
a word with you.

45:31.028 --> 45:34.029
Ooh, all right, Captain Ominous.

45:36.732 --> 45:39.868
The fucking guy.

45:45.042 --> 45:47.409
Oh, way to go, Einstein.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.544
Our scientist, Albert Einstein--
a real jackass.

45:49.546 --> 45:53.515
Mr. President, may I present
Douglas MacArthur,

45:53.517 --> 45:56.084
Chief of Staff
of the United States Army.

45:57.186 --> 45:58.386
Mr. President,

45:58.388 --> 45:59.554
Call me Frank.

45:59.556 --> 46:01.990
Dougie Mac.
Peace be with you.

46:01.992 --> 46:02.891
And also with you.

46:02.893 --> 46:04.659
My father was a midget
so, I'll keep it short.

46:04.661 --> 46:06.928
I heard your speech about ending
prohibition, earlier.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.030
Dope, wasn't it?
I was freestyling.

46:09.032 --> 46:10.532
And I can go along with that

46:10.534 --> 46:11.633
when we fuck all those bastards

46:11.635 --> 46:13.802
who wanted prohibition
in the first place.

46:13.804 --> 46:15.303
But unfortunately sir,

46:15.305 --> 46:17.639
you can't end it right now.

46:17.641 --> 46:19.174
Why not?

46:19.176 --> 46:20.775
What we have here

46:20.777 --> 46:22.043
is a pale lager.

46:22.045 --> 46:24.145
And apparently it's been shipped
from overseas.

46:24.147 --> 46:27.148
Now, some college students
have bootlegged it

46:27.150 --> 46:30.151
and drank it,
and have been wolfing out.

46:30.153 --> 46:32.187
Well, what did you do to them?

46:32.189 --> 46:33.588
We killed them!

46:33.590 --> 46:34.356
Is that legal?

46:34.358 --> 46:37.158
We're the United States
Government-- anything's legal

46:37.160 --> 46:37.893
Fuck yeah.

46:37.895 --> 46:40.328
Now we ran some tests on this
and sure enough we did find

46:40.330 --> 46:42.764
some small traces
of werewolf blood in it.

46:42.766 --> 46:45.367
And the beer itself
came back German.

46:45.369 --> 46:46.635
Same as the wolf.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.536
Motherfucker!
And that's not all.

46:48.538 --> 46:52.440
We got a report that some kids
went full on beast mode

46:52.442 --> 46:54.175
after drinking some wine.

46:54.177 --> 46:55.343
So, we tested that, as well.

46:55.345 --> 46:56.878
And it came back Italian.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.246
Polluted with wolf blood.

46:58.248 --> 47:00.315
Doesn't make any sense, Dougie.

47:00.317 --> 47:01.283
Tell me about it.

47:01.285 --> 47:04.653
Oh, and there was
a lone case of sake

47:04.655 --> 47:07.355
that was found
in the freighter.

47:07.357 --> 47:09.858
Untouched, obviously.

47:09.860 --> 47:10.659
Obviously.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.794
Anybody drank that,
they'd come down

47:12.796 --> 47:16.131
with a fast case
of dick-in-the-mouth.

47:16.133 --> 47:17.966
Chief symptom--
foaming at the ass.

47:17.968 --> 47:22.904
They'd start smelling
in the testicular area.

47:23.239 --> 47:25.974
Shut the fuck up, Einstein!

47:27.677 --> 47:28.643
Damn!

47:28.645 --> 47:32.514
Now, I know this may
sound crazy, Mr. President,

47:32.516 --> 47:36.885
but we think that Germany
and Italy and Japan

47:36.887 --> 47:38.720
are joining forces

47:38.722 --> 47:41.189
to form a kind of axis of power

47:41.191 --> 47:42.724
to take over the world

47:42.726 --> 47:44.326
and turn everyone
into werewolves.

47:44.328 --> 47:47.028
Thundercunt!
Yes, it's a real fuckery!

47:47.030 --> 47:48.663
That same freighter is back

47:48.665 --> 47:51.733
unloading at a warehouse
on a dock in Baltimore.

47:51.735 --> 47:53.601
I have a team of my men
standing by.

47:53.603 --> 47:55.603
No, that won't be necessary.

47:55.605 --> 47:57.839
I got this shit on lock.

47:57.841 --> 48:00.675
I had a feeling
you were going to say that.

48:00.677 --> 48:03.378
Heard you were
a real hard-core S.O.B.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.114
You know, don't let
this limp fool you.

48:06.116 --> 48:07.916
I'm as street as they come.

48:07.918 --> 48:11.219
You cross me and the
motherfuckers come undone.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.787
No tux, no cummerbund.

48:12.789 --> 48:16.458
Respect-- Einstein, the chair.

48:17.760 --> 48:18.660
The chair?

48:18.662 --> 48:22.597
I call this the Delano 2000.

48:25.434 --> 48:26.201
Oh, shit.

48:26.203 --> 48:29.204
That's what the fuck
I'm talking about!

48:29.206 --> 48:30.805
Welcome to death row, gentlemen.

48:30.807 --> 48:31.539
Ha-ha!

48:31.541 --> 48:34.642
This chair is fully tricked-out
with two rocket launchers,

48:34.644 --> 48:38.246
as well as 164 rounds
of silver bullets

48:38.248 --> 48:39.280
inside the wheel wells,

48:39.282 --> 48:42.817
that when spun, activate
a machine gun-like intensity.

48:42.819 --> 48:45.420
Why do you call it
the Delano 2000?

48:45.422 --> 48:46.287
Because with this

48:46.289 --> 48:50.158
the Delano is going to blow
those werewolf asses

48:50.160 --> 48:51.426
into the next century!

48:51.428 --> 48:53.962
Regulators, mount up.

49:00.236 --> 49:02.203
Hey Paulie, what the fuck?

49:02.205 --> 49:03.738
Will you watch
what you're doing!

49:03.740 --> 49:07.108
You're going to spill that shit,
you fucking mook.

49:07.110 --> 49:09.244
Now that would be a shame.

49:09.246 --> 49:11.479
Wouldn't it?

49:13.182 --> 49:15.383
FDR.

49:15.385 --> 49:16.251
Wow.

49:16.253 --> 49:18.787
Surprised to see
you here.

49:18.789 --> 49:22.857
Hey, how's that polio
treating you, huh?

49:22.859 --> 49:26.294
Hey, I heard you were
on your last leg.

49:27.163 --> 49:30.231
But I thought you were
a stand-up guy.

49:30.233 --> 49:32.801
I'm sorry, is that your face

49:32.803 --> 49:36.504
or are you talking
out of a vagina?

49:38.307 --> 49:43.044
You crippled motherfucker!
Get him!

50:11.140 --> 50:14.676
Okay, okay, okay!

50:15.344 --> 50:17.812
Please, don't kill me, please.

50:17.814 --> 50:20.515
Oh, well, since you're being
so nice and saying, "please,"

50:20.517 --> 50:23.551
the least I can do
is offer you a drink.

50:32.895 --> 50:34.062
All right!

50:34.064 --> 50:37.465
What the hell do you want, huh?

50:38.634 --> 50:41.636
I'll do anything.

50:44.607 --> 50:46.407
I'll suck your dick.

50:46.409 --> 50:48.343
What?

50:49.812 --> 50:52.080
I'll suck your dick.

50:53.415 --> 50:54.482
Please!

50:54.484 --> 50:55.450
Get the fuck out of here

50:55.452 --> 50:57.185
and show some respect
for yourself, man!

50:57.187 --> 50:59.187
Thank you, thank you,
Mr. President.

50:59.189 --> 51:02.423
And tell your leader,
if I see another werewolf

51:02.425 --> 51:03.391
on American soil,

51:03.393 --> 51:05.160
I am personally going
to come over there,

51:05.162 --> 51:08.863
roll down the streets, and kill
every last motherfucker

51:08.865 --> 51:10.999
I see with a face comb-over.

51:11.001 --> 51:12.033
Do you hear me!

51:12.035 --> 51:16.571
The Delano don't give a fuck!

52:09.158 --> 52:09.891
Boss,

52:09.893 --> 52:11.259
Eh, what's the matter
with you?

52:11.261 --> 52:14.262
I'm making cannoli,
you scared me out of my skin.

52:14.264 --> 52:16.331
I mean,
I know we're werewolf,

52:16.333 --> 52:19.000
but have some couth,
for Chris sake, huh?

52:19.002 --> 52:20.535
I'm sorry, boss.

52:20.537 --> 52:22.370
How did the drop off go?

52:22.372 --> 52:24.572
Not too good, boss.

52:24.574 --> 52:27.408
You see, Roosevelt showed up

52:27.410 --> 52:30.979
and uh... he sort of killed
everyone.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.513
How the hell he kill everybody?

52:32.515 --> 52:34.482
The guy got polio,
for fuck sake!

52:34.484 --> 52:36.784
That's just it--
he rolled up in some kind

52:36.786 --> 52:38.453
of tricked-out
wheel-fucking chair

52:38.455 --> 52:42.223
with machine guns
and missile contraptions.

52:42.225 --> 52:43.224
I don't know.

52:43.226 --> 52:46.828
But you still alive--
how do you do that, eh?

52:47.363 --> 52:50.298
You suck the dick?

52:50.733 --> 52:52.600
Oh, you suck the dick?

52:52.602 --> 52:54.302
Oh, you suck the dick, Vincent.

52:54.304 --> 52:56.304
No suck the dick.

52:56.306 --> 52:58.506
Eh, Vincenzo,
do me a favor.

52:58.508 --> 52:59.807
You take a little plug
over there,

52:59.809 --> 53:02.010
you stick it in the wall
in the hole that says Hitler.

53:02.012 --> 53:05.146
Yeah, I make a call, go ahead.
Yeah, sure, boss.

53:06.148 --> 53:07.515
Anything else, boss?

53:07.517 --> 53:10.151
No, I'm good, Vincenzo.

53:22.898 --> 53:24.465
You got to take a drink.

53:24.467 --> 53:26.501
<i>Hitler, it's Moose.</i>

53:26.503 --> 53:28.169
Shit got fucked up.

53:28.171 --> 53:30.538
FDR, he iced everybody.

53:30.540 --> 53:33.775
<i>Scheisse, I told you that guy
was ein badass.</i>

53:33.777 --> 53:35.977
What do you
suggest we do?

53:35.979 --> 53:37.578
You already know
my answer.

53:37.580 --> 53:40.515
It rhymes with go
to fucking war.

53:40.517 --> 53:41.816
Big shock, there.

53:41.818 --> 53:43.618
You talk
to Hirohito?

53:43.620 --> 53:46.087
No, I'll get him
on the 3-way.

53:46.089 --> 53:47.322
Oh, scheisse!

53:47.324 --> 53:51.025
Are you playing beer pong again
with the big-titty girl?

53:51.027 --> 53:52.493
Who me?

53:52.495 --> 53:58.633
No, we're just working on
plans to kill Jews. Ah.

53:58.635 --> 54:00.702
Get me Hirohito.

54:19.555 --> 54:20.788
Hello.

54:20.790 --> 54:23.157
Hiro, it's Moosie
and Hitler.

54:23.159 --> 54:26.694
Excellent, how did
the mission go?

54:26.696 --> 54:28.162
Is Franklin dead?

54:28.164 --> 54:30.665
No, he sniffed out
our plan

54:30.667 --> 54:31.933
and kill all
my mafia guys

54:31.935 --> 54:34.369
before they had a chance
for the beer and the wine

54:34.371 --> 54:35.870
to spill
and take effect.

54:35.872 --> 54:36.971
Did anyone think--

54:36.973 --> 54:39.407
Sir, this package just
came for you.

54:39.409 --> 54:41.309
Did I not kill you already?

54:41.311 --> 54:43.845
No, sir, we do not
all look alike.

54:43.847 --> 54:47.048
I'm on 3-way long distance!

54:47.050 --> 54:50.451
I'm sorry, sir,
but this is from America.

54:50.453 --> 54:53.955
There's a card that's
from the White House

54:53.957 --> 54:56.190
Hold on, guys.

55:03.999 --> 55:06.200
Son of bitch!

55:10.639 --> 55:12.907
I say we go to war.

55:12.909 --> 55:15.143
If we spread
the werewolf virus

55:15.145 --> 55:17.478
across to neighboring
countries,

55:17.480 --> 55:21.482
we can take over
the world slowly

55:21.484 --> 55:23.017
and we crush him!

55:23.019 --> 55:25.620
Yes, finally someone
who gets it.

55:25.622 --> 55:27.188
Hito, you are awesome.

55:27.190 --> 55:30.391
I'll start with Austria,
Czechoslovakia,

55:30.393 --> 55:33.027
und then we march
into Poland for lunch.

55:33.029 --> 55:34.395
I will take over China.

55:34.397 --> 55:36.664
Cool, I'll take
Ethiopia.

55:36.666 --> 55:37.665
What!

55:37.667 --> 55:39.634
You fucking pussy.

55:39.636 --> 55:40.701
Ethiopia, really?

55:40.703 --> 55:43.004
What, Ethiopia
is strong.

55:43.006 --> 55:45.540
Great runners--
guys run very fast.

55:45.542 --> 55:47.608
Plus, Hitler,
you going to need

55:47.610 --> 55:49.544
somebody coming up
from the south

55:49.546 --> 55:51.078
when they retreat down.

55:51.080 --> 55:54.715
Yeah, well, it's kind of ein
bitch move, but whatevers.

55:54.717 --> 55:57.218
Bitchy, bitchy, bitchy.

55:57.220 --> 55:58.953
Eh, fuck you guys.

55:58.955 --> 56:01.689
Eh? Moosehead out.

56:04.126 --> 56:06.494
Drink up, bitch,
salute the fuhrer--

56:06.496 --> 56:07.862
Heil me, Heil me.

56:07.864 --> 56:11.232
Are you playing beer pong?

56:12.535 --> 56:16.137
Can't hear you--
bad reception.

56:16.139 --> 56:20.141
Now, where were we, Fraulein?

56:27.349 --> 56:29.383
The werewolfs are
spreading fast.

56:29.385 --> 56:31.953
That's why I came here
in person, he needs our help.

56:31.955 --> 56:33.154
Have you ever met him?

56:33.156 --> 56:35.456
No, but I heard he's
a big drinker.

56:35.458 --> 56:36.791
Who isn't?

56:36.793 --> 56:39.494
Well, I've invited Buford
and his wife to join us.

56:39.496 --> 56:42.797
Hopefully,
he'll help break the ice.

56:42.799 --> 56:44.198
Who's this--

56:44.200 --> 56:47.235
Frank, I came as soon
as I got your message.

56:47.237 --> 56:50.438
Oh, hello, Congressman
Cleavon Baybridge Buford,

56:50.440 --> 56:53.040
Repube, Georgia--
also vice-president

56:53.042 --> 56:54.275
of the hot tub committee.

56:54.277 --> 56:57.178
My wi-- well, I'm sorry,

56:57.180 --> 56:58.479
Dougie Mac, is that you?

56:58.481 --> 57:01.115
No, I don't think we've met.

57:01.117 --> 57:02.750
Oh, sure we have.

57:02.752 --> 57:06.120
You did a cannonball
into the hot tub last week

57:06.122 --> 57:07.955
when the Swiss delegates
were there.

57:07.957 --> 57:10.992
No, I think you're thinking
of someone else.

57:10.994 --> 57:13.194
You're hung like
a full-grown ox.

57:13.196 --> 57:15.329
That's Dougie Mac!

57:16.365 --> 57:18.966
Mr. President,
may I present to you,

57:18.968 --> 57:21.168
Sir Winston Churchill.

57:21.170 --> 57:23.137
You guys are drinking.

57:23.139 --> 57:25.139
And during a time like this.

57:25.141 --> 57:28.876
Jesus, honestly,
had I known this,

57:30.145 --> 57:32.380
I would have come earlier.

57:32.382 --> 57:34.715
Rosey, you old son of a bitch.

57:34.717 --> 57:37.485
Oh, Winny, Winny,
it's nice to meet you.

57:37.487 --> 57:39.153
Buford, would you pour him
a drink?

57:39.155 --> 57:41.422
Yes, sir, in just
a moment, sir.

57:41.424 --> 57:42.590
I bring my own.

57:42.592 --> 57:44.559
Well, that's my kind
of man, yes.

57:44.561 --> 57:48.229
Call this the Georgia sweet tea.

57:50.532 --> 57:52.466
Thank you, Mrs. Buford.

57:52.468 --> 57:56.337
Boy, this drink is as stiff
as a dead man's cock.

57:56.339 --> 57:58.172
Thank you, sir.

57:58.174 --> 57:59.373
I take great pride in that.

57:59.375 --> 58:03.711
My father passed away
with an erection.

58:04.246 --> 58:04.946
Look, Rosey,

58:04.948 --> 58:07.648
I'm going to cut through
all the dumb shit--

58:07.650 --> 58:09.216
we're at war.

58:09.218 --> 58:11.752
And these goddamn werewolves
are getting

58:11.754 --> 58:13.454
closer and closer to us
by the day.

58:13.456 --> 58:16.524
So, what do you need
from The Delano?

58:16.526 --> 58:18.559
Supplies, ammo, ships, tanks--

58:18.561 --> 58:22.263
anything you can spare that will
stop these fucking things!

58:22.265 --> 58:24.298
And look, we're the only ones

58:24.300 --> 58:25.933
who speak English
over in Europe.

58:25.935 --> 58:27.802
You need us to be
werewolf free.

58:27.804 --> 58:30.404
Ireland speaks English.

58:32.608 --> 58:34.275
You need someone
you can understand.

58:34.277 --> 58:35.476
Half the time I don't
even know

58:35.478 --> 58:37.144
what these potato fuckers
are trying to say.

58:37.146 --> 58:41.215
Look, just lend me something
that will blow their minds.

58:41.217 --> 58:44.051
Fine, I will lend you my wife.

58:44.053 --> 58:45.786
I will do it for my country.

58:45.788 --> 58:47.321
Thank you dear lady.

58:47.323 --> 58:49.357
But I actually need
real weapons.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.759
Are you saying my wife's breasts
aren't real weapons?

58:51.761 --> 58:53.060
They have killed lesser men.

58:53.062 --> 58:55.896
They're powerful, sir, but I
need weapons

58:55.898 --> 58:58.199
of steel and smoke and noise.

58:58.201 --> 58:59.734
Well, you can motorboat them
if you want

58:59.736 --> 59:00.968
and make your own noises.

59:00.970 --> 59:02.503
Well, let me level
with you, Winnie--

59:02.505 --> 59:05.973
I want those sons of bitches

59:05.975 --> 59:07.942
wiped off the face of this earth

59:07.944 --> 59:09.110
just as much as you do.

59:09.112 --> 59:13.114
But I have to justify this
to the American people.

59:16.718 --> 59:20.488
Dougie, do we got
any extra shit?

59:20.490 --> 59:23.791
Sure, we can open up some more
defense plants too.

59:23.793 --> 59:26.293
Frank, there's an election
coming up.

59:26.295 --> 59:29.964
No offense, Mr. Churchill, but
we can't just lend it to you.

59:30.465 --> 59:32.366
But we could lease it to you.

59:32.368 --> 59:36.137
And whatever you use,
you pay for.

59:36.471 --> 59:38.572
So it would be sort of a--

59:38.574 --> 59:41.409
a lend-lease kind of program?

59:41.411 --> 59:43.277
Exactly.

59:45.480 --> 59:46.814
You've got a deal!

59:46.816 --> 59:51.419
Oh, damn, go Winnie!

59:51.421 --> 59:52.787
Also, uh...

59:52.789 --> 59:54.488
I could lease you my wife.

59:54.490 --> 59:57.158
Yeah, whatever holes you use,
you pay for.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.293
I think we'll all take
that deal.

59:59.295 --> 01:00:00.261
To the hot tub!

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.363
Yes, sir, to the hot tub.

01:00:04.332 --> 01:00:06.367
Did you bring cash?

01:00:34.696 --> 01:00:36.831
Mr. President,
Uh-huh.

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.766
I have an urgent telegram
from Churchill.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.167
Please read it aloud.

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:43.671
Rosey, it's me!

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.873
No, I didn't mean loud.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.108
Just read it normally.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.275
Rosey, it's me,

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:51.846
Winnie has his head stuck
in the honey pot on this one.

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.514
Need troops.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.649
Send Miss Buford over too.

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:58.185
XO, W.C.

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:01.489
Oh, shit.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.357
I was afraid of this.

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:08.295
I was trying to keep us
out of this damn war

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:10.598
as long as I could.

01:01:12.601 --> 01:01:15.770
Being President
of the free world is--

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:18.439
oh, it's so stressful.

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:21.375
I bet-- sir, anything
that I can do?

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.844
How about a massage?

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.347
That would be rad.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.317
No, what are you doing? Don't.

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:32.253
Don't, no, they're all
shriveled-up from polio.

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:37.191
I don't mind-- just sit and relax.
Don't-- don't.

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.894
Shh-hhh

01:01:40.962 --> 01:01:43.230
Oh, God, that feels so good.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.565
Oh, God.

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:48.235
Oh, my God.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:54.108
Eleanor hates my tiny, little,
shriveled-up polio legs.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.810
I don't.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:56.811
Oh God!

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.779
They remind me of home!

01:01:58.781 --> 01:01:59.446
Huh?

01:01:59.448 --> 01:02:01.448
I used to enter the hot dog
eating contest

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.884
every year at Coney Island.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:10.457
So sexy!

01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:19.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:36.016
Tie me, Frank, tie me!

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:50.464
Frank,

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.100
What the shit?

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.803
It's not what it seems, unh-unh.

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:56.904
Oh, it's not?

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:59.473
Because it looks like
your secretary is sucking

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.141
mustard and ketchup off of you.

01:03:01.143 --> 01:03:02.176
Then it is what it seems.

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:05.880
And it looks
like Eleanor Roosevelt

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:09.049
is going to have
to strong arm a ho!

01:03:10.185 --> 01:03:11.285
Get the fuck out of here,

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:13.854
I need to talk
to my husband, bitch!

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:18.559
Really, Franklin.

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:19.960
Jesus.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.829
Oh, my God, just look
at yourself.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.732
You are President
of the United States!

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.568
Frank! Ooh.
What is it, Louis?

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.170
MacArthur's here with General
Eisenhower-- says it's urgent.

01:03:30.172 --> 01:03:32.806
Oh, of course,
it's always fucking urgent!

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:35.509
Well, I--
Well, I, oh-- by all means, go.

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:37.611
And if they ask you
what happened here,

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:43.484
just tell them a rainbow
took a shit on your legs.

01:03:47.522 --> 01:03:48.756
Do you have a handkerchief,
Louis?

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:52.426
I think it's going to take
a full-blown shower, chief.

01:03:53.561 --> 01:03:55.763
Talk to her--
Eleanor's more important.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.398
I'll make the Generals wait.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.667
Jesus.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:03.270
<i>General, General...</i>

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:06.607
<i>wait.</i>

01:04:14.516 --> 01:04:17.284
Oh, so this is what
this room looks like.

01:04:17.719 --> 01:04:20.487
I wouldn't know because you've
never let me sleep in here.

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:24.224
Don't you dare try to turn this
around on me.

01:04:24.226 --> 01:04:26.727
I saw that whore on her knees

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:31.198
rubbing and moaning all over you
as she touched your le--

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.199
What?

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.168
My what, Eleanor?
Say it.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.703
I want you to say it.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:39.373
Your le-- le-- le--

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:44.611
Legs-- my tiny, little,
shriveled-up polio legs!

01:04:44.613 --> 01:04:47.715
Eleanor, take a good look
at them!

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.216
No.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.584
Look at them.

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:54.088
I can't, it's just too hard, Frank.
Is it?

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:57.191
Is it hard for you, Eleanor?

01:04:57.726 --> 01:04:59.693
What about me?

01:05:00.729 --> 01:05:02.796
I'm stuck
in this damn wheelchair

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:03.998
for the rest of my life
with a wife

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.966
who doesn't want to have
sex with me.

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:08.369
I may be the only President

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.137
in the history
of the United States

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:13.007
who's never
gotten laid in office.

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:15.709
And this is my third term!

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:18.545
Now, am I going to ball
the secretary,

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:21.548
who obviously has daddy issues,
of course I am!

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.384
Because, at least,
she shows some interest in me.

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:27.021
Did you honestly believe
that I thought

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:29.156
that you had to tend
to the children

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:32.159
every night
for the last nine years?

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:34.561
Eleanor, we have one kid

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:37.498
who's old enough
to shit in a vase!

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.533
I know.

01:05:42.237 --> 01:05:44.538
Excuse me.

01:05:45.573 --> 01:05:48.375
I have to go tend

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:51.745
to an entire nation.

01:05:56.518 --> 01:05:59.486
Damn you, Frank!

01:06:04.659 --> 01:06:06.160
At ease, gentlemen, sit.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.562
What's the haps, Dougie Mac?

01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:10.564
And who the fuck is this?

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:13.033
This is General
Dwight Eisenhower,

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.135
call sign-- Dew Drop.

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:16.336
Mr. President,

01:06:16.338 --> 01:06:18.138
it is a pleasure for me
to be here--

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.041
Let's keep the pleasantries to
the left hand on your clam bag.

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:25.212
You know, I'm surprised to see
you boys here this late.

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.347
This better be important.

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:29.383
Well, sir, I only wish
we were here to tell you

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:32.753
about some hot dog eating
contest that's gone wrong.

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.588
But we're not.

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:38.158
What the fuck did you just say?

01:06:39.294 --> 01:06:40.727
Come here.

01:06:40.729 --> 01:06:42.796
Come here.

01:06:46.701 --> 01:06:49.603
Come here-- a little closer.
Yes, sir.

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:53.173
I can fucking weigh you down,
pretty boy!

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.741
Mr. President!

01:06:54.743 --> 01:06:57.978
Mr. President!
Mr. President!

01:06:59.214 --> 01:07:01.181
Okay, all right.

01:07:04.352 --> 01:07:06.386
You still got it, you old
son of a bitch-- good!

01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:09.490
We're going to need your spirit.
For what?

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:10.457
War!

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.626
I got this telegram
from Churchill.

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.394
Shit is fucked up
over there.

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:17.231
He's not going to be able
to hold out much longer.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.233
They're converging from all
angles, Mr. President.

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:22.236
Germany has already taken
Austria, Czechoslovakia,

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.338
Poland, and France
is likely next.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.772
Of course, they're pussies.

01:07:25.774 --> 01:07:27.941
Japan has taken
complete control of China

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:30.210
and now, they're focusing
on Russia.

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:34.181
I also got a telegram
from Missy, from your secretary,

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:35.516
from the Prime Minister
of Ethiopia.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:38.152
Italy has taken them over
and I dismissed it because--

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:40.654
Because it's fucking Ethiopia.

01:07:41.389 --> 01:07:43.991
In all seriousness, sir,
I know you've been trying

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.893
to avoid going to war
for years, but now--

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.695
We must blast
their fucking asses!

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:52.366
Player to player, pimp to pimp,
I appreciate it.

01:07:52.734 --> 01:07:55.469
Well, let me put my mind
on the grind

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:58.739
while you unwind--
just for tonight.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.708
I'll go fireside
on their ass tomorrow

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:05.012
and when the American people
come home from work,

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.380
I'll tell them...

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.483
that we're going to war.

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:12.452
I want you two to strategize
a plan of attack.

01:08:12.454 --> 01:08:14.621
And we'll reconvene at O. H.!

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.455
R.O.

01:08:15.457 --> 01:08:18.692
I'll catch you
in the heart of things.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.861
Mr. President.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:45.419
Mr. President, do you need
anything before bed, sir?

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.587
You got anything that will
tell me what to do

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.488
with this fucking mess
I'm in, right now?

01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:52.492
Third drawer down on the right--
Washington's humidor.

01:08:52.493 --> 01:08:56.462
It'll give you advice
on everything you need to know.

01:09:13.915 --> 01:09:19.118
What kind of shit
were you into, G-dubs?

01:09:42.777 --> 01:09:44.611
Oh.

01:09:47.849 --> 01:09:52.752
<i>Jane, Mary Jane,
Mary Jane, how I miss you.</i>

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:56.490
<i>Over here, boss.</i>

01:09:57.659 --> 01:09:59.359
<i>You going to choke on that
like a prom date</i>

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.828
<i>or are you going to give
The Honest One some?</i>

01:10:02.597 --> 01:10:05.565
Oh, shit, I'm high.

01:10:05.567 --> 01:10:06.533
<i>Yeah, that's rad.</i>

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:08.168
Would you pass that dutchie
to the right-hand side--

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:11.338
I've been dead for 75 years
there, chief.

01:10:16.678 --> 01:10:19.012
Thanks, dude.

01:10:24.185 --> 01:10:26.186
Why don't you come with me?

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.655
We're going to talk.

01:10:39.901 --> 01:10:41.735
Are you real?

01:10:42.203 --> 01:10:46.540
No, only when other presidents
are in time of crisis

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:47.941
and need advice.

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:50.377
Oh, man, that is so cool.
Yeah.

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.979
There's this president in
the next century-- Uh-huh.

01:10:52.981 --> 01:10:56.483
Obama-- he's going to be talking
to me a lot.

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:58.318
Oh, man, you got
a raw deal

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.755
with that whole
John Wilkes Booth thing.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:06.193
Mary Todd had to go
to that fucking play.

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:06.893
Bitch.

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:08.428
Hey it sounds like
you did any better.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.430
Where?
What has two wheels,

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.666
looks gay, and isn't a bicycle?

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.301
This guy.
D'oh!

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:16.036
Well played, sir,

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.872
well played.

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:23.176
Oh, fuck, Linc, I'm in a real
shit-pickle with the missus.

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:27.714
She caught me playing hide
the wrench in the steam engine

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.750
with my secretary.

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:31.184
I know, I saw that.

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:34.521
What?
You bastard, you were watching?

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:35.889
Of course.

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.424
You were about two minutes away

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.627
from her throwing your legs
over her head.

01:11:42.463 --> 01:11:44.664
Somebody had told me
that the Japanese,

01:11:44.666 --> 01:11:47.067
that their werewolves
are teaming up

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:51.271
with the German
and the Italian werewolves

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:53.206
and they're trying
to take over the world.

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:55.809
But I just can't
figure out why.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.011
Now, you were attacked,
right?

01:11:58.013 --> 01:12:02.983
Do you have any insight
on the werewolf tip?

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:08.255
Werewolves-- they're
telepathic-- always have been.

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:11.525
They can sense when someone's
born with true greatness--

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.860
someone who's a revolutionary.

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.562
That's what they see in you.

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:16.630
It's what they saw in me.

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:17.964
It's what they saw
in Washington.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.833
Hey, what, did they attack
G-thing too?

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:23.403
That's why he left
his weed.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:25.338
That's why I could have
this talk with him,

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.407
and so, you could have
this talk with me.

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:29.342
Why didn't they go
after Woodrow?

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:33.380
Oh, I mean, he was, you know,
there for World War I.

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:34.681
That was a bitch war.

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:37.884
We really didn't need
to be in that shit.

01:12:41.522 --> 01:12:44.391
G-dub was a rocking
revolutionary.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.726
I laid the beat down on civil
and you're the man.

01:12:46.728 --> 01:12:49.296
You are the man to lead us
through the deuce.

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.765
Oh, shit, I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:54.367
I'm just freestyling
half the time.

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.970
I just do what I feel is right.

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.773
I didn't know what the fuck
I was doing.

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:00.941
Shit.

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:02.342
I thought so.

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.410
Don't worry, man,

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:05.579
I just did what I believed
in my heart.

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:07.180
You do the same
and you'll be straight.

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:11.384
You're one
cool motherfucker, Linc.

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:12.819
I know.

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:15.689
You are, man,
you are.

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.358
You want to see something cool?

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.560
What's that?

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.163
I can fucking fly.

01:13:24.365 --> 01:13:26.900
This is awesome!
Isn't it?

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:30.337
Hey look, there's my monument.

01:13:30.905 --> 01:13:33.707
Is there going to be a statue
like that of me?

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.242
No, no, no, but they're
going to name like,

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.345
a thousand high schools
after you.

01:13:38.846 --> 01:13:41.381
That's cool.
Yes, it is.

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.617
Hey, Hey, check it out.

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:46.486
There's a hot dog vendor.
You-- you hungry?

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:50.257
Hey, FDR, this is for you,
Roosevelt.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.559
Yeah!

01:13:53.895 --> 01:13:56.429
Oh, you fucker!

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.136
Oh, shit.
What?

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:04.971
Look at them.

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:08.708
What's up, Abe?

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:09.776
Thanks for freeing me.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.778
Look, I'm fucking a white girl.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.313
You're welcome.

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:14.915
Emancipate that ass.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.883
You know this, kid.

01:14:18.986 --> 01:14:21.555
God damnit, you are cool.
I know.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.390
Here you go, Sam.

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:24.190
Who's that?

01:14:24.192 --> 01:14:26.560
That's Uncle Sam,
the bald eagle of justice.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:29.329
Why don't you grab on to those
wings and he'll carry you home.

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:31.665
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm too heavy.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:35.201
No, if he can handle Taft,
he can certainly handle you.

01:14:35.203 --> 01:14:36.202
Come on there, Frankie,

01:14:36.204 --> 01:14:37.304
grab one of those wings
of justice.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.040
Grab on and he'll take you home.
No, I can't.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.641
No, I can't, no.
You can do it.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:44.444
I can't, I can't--
oh, shit!

01:14:46.714 --> 01:14:47.881
Hey!

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:51.184
You weren't honest at all!

01:14:57.725 --> 01:14:59.659
You okay, sir?

01:15:00.194 --> 01:15:01.494
I had this weird dream.

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:05.298
Louis, get Dougie Mac
and Ike on the phone.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.600
Right away, sir.

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.034
Scrambled eggs and sausage, sir?

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.703
You look like
you have the munchies.

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:11.638
Oh, that sounds good.

01:15:12.373 --> 01:15:14.941
Jorge,
Si, senor.

01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:17.243
Respect.

01:15:17.245 --> 01:15:19.512
For what?

01:15:30.191 --> 01:15:32.525
Let's get wet.

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:33.660
Louis, you got him?

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:36.763
Our drop point
is right here, gentlemen.

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:38.832
And once you hit
the ground

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:40.700
you have to hit
the ground running.

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.469
Our element
of surprise,

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.837
it's only going
to last so long

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.071
once they finally
figure out

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:49.275
that we're actually launching
a full-scale attack.

01:15:53.614 --> 01:15:55.181
Attention!

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:56.583
I got it from here, Ike.

01:15:56.585 --> 01:16:01.421
I know what you're thinking,
as you stare at that map.

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:02.856
Hell, I'm thinking
the same thing.

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.891
How in the world
are we going to storm

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:05.925
the beaches of Normandy,

01:16:05.927 --> 01:16:09.129
take down an entire army
of werewolves,

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:13.333
and still make it to a French
titty-bar by last call?

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:15.835
At ease, gentlemen.

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.871
I am not going to tell you

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:21.541
that there aren't
going to be casualties,

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:23.643
or that it's going to be easy.

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.645
Because it's not.

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:31.418
Unfortunately, that is
the business of war.

01:16:32.486 --> 01:16:35.055
I can't change that.

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:39.025
But I can lead by example.

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:41.761
And not the example
of somebody

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.963
who has survived
a werewolf attack

01:16:43.965 --> 01:16:48.568
and now wheels back and forth
in front of you

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:52.238
like a God damn cripple
in a wheel chair!

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.743
That's right--
take a good look.

01:16:58.746 --> 01:17:00.747
Cripple in a wheelchair!

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.515
Cripple in the wheelchair!

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.951
I could have heard that
my entire life

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.820
as people waited on me
hand and foot.

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:09.155
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:11.224
Except I wanted more--

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:15.462
I wanted to be the President
of the United States.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:19.132
I wanted to lead
this great nation of ours

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:20.200
in its darkest hour.

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:24.137
And now I am going to lead
you into war.

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:27.941
I am going to fly
the first plane in

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:31.010
and lead our troops
onto the beach.

01:17:31.012 --> 01:17:33.379
"Why would you do this?"
you might ask.

01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:37.717
Not because I'm President
of the United States.

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.453
Not because it's
the heroic thing to do.

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:43.156
I am doing this to prove

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.924
to those werewolves,

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:47.060
that despite their attack,

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:49.729
I am not just
going to sit here

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:54.667
like some cripple
in a wheelchair!

01:17:55.369 --> 01:17:56.369
Now look,

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:59.439
I know that you're scared.

01:18:00.207 --> 01:18:02.776
Hell, I'm afraid too.

01:18:05.112 --> 01:18:08.248
But I want you to remember...

01:18:21.362 --> 01:18:25.832
we have nothing
to fear, but...

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.637
fear itself.

01:18:31.238 --> 01:18:37.143
Now, let's go kick
some werewolf ass tomorrow!

01:19:11.946 --> 01:19:14.747
Hito's been handled,
he won't bother us anymore.

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:16.382
Word.
Yep.

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:17.350
Fucking Einstein--

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:20.386
That project he was working on
in Manhattan is ready.

01:19:23.123 --> 01:19:25.925
Way to go, Einstein.

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:26.826
Let me go with you.

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:29.996
No, Lou, The Delano's
got to do this on his own.

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:31.397
I'm a motorcycle of death.

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:33.733
I ain't got no sidecar.
I know.

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:36.369
Chair's all loaded
with silver Bs.

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.537
Rockets are loaded.

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:40.139
You're all set.
Thanks, man.

01:19:40.141 --> 01:19:42.775
Oh, Lou, I just want you
to know,

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:44.878
if anything happens to me,

01:19:45.713 --> 01:19:47.714
take care of my mistress,
will you?

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:48.548
I have a spare key

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.983
for the Lincoln bedroom
underneath the mat,

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:53.319
but you might want to change
the sheets first, though.

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.154
Okay.

01:19:55.156 --> 01:19:56.990
Word.

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.625
Word.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:00.159
Give them hell, Frank!

01:20:00.161 --> 01:20:02.195
Yeah!

01:20:28.355 --> 01:20:32.425
Tower one, this is
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:35.395
call sign-- Wheels of Steel.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:36.763
Ready for take off.

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.331
<i>Roger that, Mr. President.</i>

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:40.233
<i>This is
Commander Winston Churchill,</i>

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.735
call sign--
Big Fish and Chips.

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.370
You're clear for take off.

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:46.306
Winnie, you old son of a bitch,

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:47.473
what are you doing in there?

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.309
<i>Do you think I'd miss this?</i>

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:50.310
If I wasn't drunk and blind,

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:52.211
I'd be up there with you,
right now.

01:20:52.213 --> 01:20:55.315
I appreciate that, Churchie.

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:56.382
No retreat.

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:58.251
No fucking surrender!

01:20:58.253 --> 01:20:59.385
God damn right!

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:00.853
Now, go over there and blow

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:01.988
those fucking werewolves

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.423
off the face of the planet!

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:04.924
Over and out.

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:08.795
May God be with you, Frank.

01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:14.901
Oh, come on, George.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.602
I'm fidgeting here

01:21:16.604 --> 01:21:18.371
like a three-peckered puppy
in a wood chipper.

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:20.473
Hold on, hold on,
I'm almost there.

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.742
<i>Oh, ho-ho-ho!</i>

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:24.544
I think that's him.

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.712
<i>So, I said to Stalin,</i>

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.513
<i>"I don't care
if you are Russian,</i>

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:29.916
<i>you can't grab
another man's cock at dinner</i>

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:32.986
<i>and say, 'Sorry, I thought
that was my breadstick.'"</i>

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:34.721
<i>You know?
That's him all right.</i>

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.789
<i>Commies, what are
you going to do with them?</i>

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:39.192
<i>They're all dick grabbers.
They love it.</i>

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:42.261
<i>All right, Frank,
you're approaching France.</i>

01:21:42.263 --> 01:21:46.466
<i>Let's go silent on the radio
unless it's necessary-- over.</i>

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.201
<i>Over and out.</i>

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.202
Get a hold of him?

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:52.205
Yeah, I think Stalin
got a hold of him, personal.

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:53.639
That is enough, George.

01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:54.941
Sorry, go back to standing

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:56.376
in the corner and being black.

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:57.510
How are you, Eleanor?

01:21:57.512 --> 01:22:00.346
I'm hanging in there.

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:03.616
I'm just so worried.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:04.450
Yeah.

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:07.153
Can't imagine what
you must be feeling.

01:22:23.203 --> 01:22:27.707
Boss, boss, it's FDR.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.380
Whoop, what the fuck?

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:35.948
<i>What is it, Frank?</i>

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.417
I'm under attack.

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:38.818
Jesus Hightower Christ,

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.820
they're lighting me up like
an Indian peace pipe

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:42.255
before the first
Thanksgiving dinner!

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.190
God damnit, Frank,
get the hell out of there!

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:46.459
I can't, there's
too much fire power.

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.394
These fucking werewolves
are relentless.

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:53.099
Ha ha, it's time to go
cripple-dick crazy

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:56.269
on these motherfuckers!

01:23:15.456 --> 01:23:16.989
I was going to open

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:20.593
a chain of Italian
restaurants in America

01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:24.597
with a staff that make
you feel like family.

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:27.200
I was going to call

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.169
the Olive...

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.839
Garden.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:36.542
What kind of name
is Delano, anyway?

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.878
It sounds Jewish!

01:23:41.281 --> 01:23:42.682
Oh, oh, shit.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:43.916
Shit, I'm hit, I'm hit.

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:47.787
<i>Talk to me, Frank, Talk to me.
The right engine is out.</i>

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:49.288
<i>I'm going down.</i>

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.090
I'm going down.

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.959
I'm going down!

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.060
<i>Frank!</i>

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:54.994
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:56.529
<i>This is
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,</i>

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:59.999
<i>call sign-- Wheels of Steel,
I'm going down!</i>

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.200
<i>I'm going down!</i>

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.503
<i>I got to bail out--
too much firepower.</i>

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:06.139
<i>I don't know if I'm going--</i>

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:11.144
No--

01:24:13.247 --> 01:24:16.883
I am a President's wife.

01:24:18.218 --> 01:24:22.321
I knew what I was getting into
when he took the job.

01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:24.490
George,

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:25.558
Yes, mam.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.362
could you get me the bottle

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:31.797
that Mr. Daniels sent over?

01:24:31.799 --> 01:24:35.067
Yes, mam.
Thank you.

01:24:41.642 --> 01:24:44.343
Cheers.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.613
I'm sure he's all right.

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:50.883
He's got to be all right--
it's Frank, right?

01:25:24.251 --> 01:25:27.920
Come here, you son of a bitch.

01:25:34.761 --> 01:25:36.028
I got your back, Frank.

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:38.598
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.167
I stashed myself away in there

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:43.636
just in case you might
need some help.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:44.503
Oh!

01:25:44.505 --> 01:25:46.706
Plus, I wouldn't miss
a chance

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.040
to help you kill
some werewolves.

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:53.246
Hold on, I'm going to get
you out of here.

01:25:54.648 --> 01:25:56.983
Underneath the arms.

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.887
Friends until the end, Frank.

01:26:01.889 --> 01:26:03.289
Friends until the end!

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:07.460
Hang on, Frank, I'm going to get
you out of here.

01:26:10.297 --> 01:26:11.764
You ready, Frank?

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:13.199
Red-eye!

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:15.134
Follow me!

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:18.771
Wow, we're really high up here,
aren't we, Frank?

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:20.806
We're really doing it.

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:22.608
We're going into war.

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:23.743
Yeah.

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:26.045
Oh, shit.

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.146
What?

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.147
Hey, Frank,

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:30.983
remember when I said,
"Friends until the end?"

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:32.218
Yeah.

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.053
well, this is the end.

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:36.222
I'm not wearing
a parachute.

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.257
I'm definitely
going to die.

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.558
You're a hero, Cleavon.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.727
I'll make sure
people know that.

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:43.663
I appreciate that, Frank.

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:45.531
And Frank,

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.367
take care of my wife for me.

01:26:53.173 --> 01:26:55.574
No doubt.

01:26:56.376 --> 01:26:58.077
Oh.

01:27:01.948 --> 01:27:03.683
Down with Americans.

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:06.285
You want The Delano, bitch!

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:11.123
You got The Delano,
motherfucker!

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:15.194
Fuck you, Roosevelt, fuck you!

01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:20.199
Picture me rolling!

01:27:22.302 --> 01:27:26.038
What's up, Hitler?

01:27:27.441 --> 01:27:31.344
<i>It's been 16 days since
President Roosevelt's plane</i>

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:33.646
<i>went down over Normandy
and there's still</i>

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:34.980
<i>no sign of the old stalwart.</i>

01:27:34.982 --> 01:27:38.150
<i>At this point most have begun
to fear the worst--</i>

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:41.020
<i>that our beloved FDR
has been killed.</i>

01:27:41.022 --> 01:27:42.521
Turn that God damn thing off.

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:44.824
I can't bear it, anymore.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:47.927
I'm back.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.763
I have a nice crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e
and a chocolate mousse.

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:54.433
I'll take the chocolate mousse if
you-- Get the fuck out of here.

01:27:55.535 --> 01:27:57.670
Bet if I was white
I could have had

01:27:57.672 --> 01:27:59.872
a chocolate mousse.

01:28:00.841 --> 01:28:04.243
<i>Who ordered the burnt honky
with the side of polio?</i>

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:06.412
For God's sake, Frank.

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.180
What?

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:09.482
Somebody die?

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:12.251
Oh yeah, Mussolini and Hitler,

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:13.853
I capped those bitches.

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:14.954
Oh, Frank, I knew it!

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:16.522
What the hell happened
out there?

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:19.191
Well, my plane was shot to shit,

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:20.126
so I had to go rogue --

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.428
I had to go with an old-school
ground attack.

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.930
There were werewolves
everywhere.

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:27.933
I just never took my finger
off the trigger.

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:29.935
It was a hell of a battle,
hell of a battle!

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:32.705
Were you captured? You've been
missing for 16 days.

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:36.275
No, I killed Hitler
and Mussolini right off--

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.576
and most of their soldiers.

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:40.813
I was cool until I had to wheel
myself out of there.

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.648
Do you know how hard it is

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:45.584
to maneuver a wheelchair
through sand?

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:49.455
Eleanor, are you okay?

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.290
You haven't said anything.

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:52.792
Aren't you happy to see me?

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:53.759
Damn you, damn you,

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:56.362
don't you ever put me through
anything like that again!

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:58.397
Ooh, come here!

01:28:58.399 --> 01:29:00.266
Come here.

01:29:04.704 --> 01:29:06.138
Sh-hhh, I told you, baby,

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:10.910
ain't nobody going to take down
The Delano.

01:29:12.879 --> 01:29:15.848
I'm going to ride you
like a free pony

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.917
at the state fair,
tonight.

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:20.519
Frank, should we leave?

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:21.654
I'm cool to stay.

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:24.123
Oh, no, actually, George,

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:26.792
I want you to rig up the radio.

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:30.429
Daddy wants to go fireside.

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:31.430
Right away, sir.

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:34.300
Back in the saddle, Frankie.

01:29:44.144 --> 01:29:45.377
My fellow Americans,

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:51.350
<i>this is your President,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</i>

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:55.754
<i>As you know, we are at war.</i>

01:29:55.756 --> 01:29:57.656
<i>And as your President,</i>

01:29:57.658 --> 01:30:02.161
<i>I felt the need to lead
our troops into battle--</i>

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:06.999
<i>a battle which
we successfully won.</i>

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:10.669
<i>The fight against werewolves
is over!</i>

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:14.707
<i>For those of you who thought
I was gone,</i>

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:18.477
allow me to reintroduce
myself--

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:23.349
It's Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
motherfucker!
