00:00.520 --> 00:02.520
<i>- My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.520 --> 00:04.760
<i>and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools</i>

00:04.780 --> 00:07.520
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.520 --> 00:08.560
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:08.580 --> 00:11.520
<i>to help struggling
small business owners make it</i>

00:11.520 --> 00:14.520
<i>in this competitive world.</i>

00:14.520 --> 00:17.520
This is "Nathan for You."

00:18.520 --> 00:19.520
<i>There's nothing more fun</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:21.520
<i>than sitting on an animal
that's bigger than you</i>

00:21.520 --> 00:23.520
<i>and riding it around,</i>

00:23.520 --> 00:25.520
<i>which is why Joy Lazarus
of Park Place Stable</i>

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
<i>in Malibu, California,
has made a business</i>

00:27.520 --> 00:30.520
<i>out of charging people
to do just that,</i>

00:30.520 --> 00:32.520
<i>unless, of course,
you're overweight.</i>

00:32.520 --> 00:34.520
- We don't want
to injure our horses,

00:34.520 --> 00:36.080
and that's what
it really comes down to,

00:36.100 --> 00:37.520
so, you know,
we're not gonna allow

00:37.520 --> 00:39.520
a 400-pound person
to ride.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.520
<i>- But unlike Joy,
I believe that everyone</i>

00:41.520 --> 00:43.520
<i>should be able to mount a horse,</i>

00:43.520 --> 00:45.520
<i>so I paid her a visit
with a way to help.</i>

00:45.520 --> 00:47.680
You know, it's nice to think
about your horses and all,

00:48.140 --> 00:50.510
but humans have feelings too.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.520
- I don't want
to reject anybody,

00:53.520 --> 00:57.520
but there's... you know, there's...
there's nothing I can do.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.680
<i>- Right now, the heaviest load</i>

00:58.700 --> 01:01.520
<i>a horse can carry is 220 pounds,</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.520
<i>and if Joy allowed riders
above that weight</i>

01:03.520 --> 01:04.519
<i>to mount a horse,</i>

01:04.519 --> 01:06.520
<i>there's a big risk
the animal will buckle</i>

01:06.520 --> 01:09.520
<i>and suffer severe
or even fatal injuries.</i>

01:11.520 --> 01:14.520
<i>But if plus-sized customers
could have their weight offset</i>

01:14.520 --> 01:16.520
<i>by being tied to helium-filled
weather balloons,</i>

01:17.520 --> 01:19.520
<i>Joy would be able to expand
her customer base</i>

01:19.520 --> 01:21.520
<i>to a totally unserved market.</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:31.520
- So, um, you want to put
balloons on a person?

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
- Correct.
- Okay.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.520
- Sometimes it's not about,
you know,

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
only making money.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.520
It's about doing what's right.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.040
Imagine if you were
the only place that

01:39.060 --> 01:43.190
could provide horsey rides
for the, uh, morbidly obese.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
- But I don't, I mean...

01:44.520 --> 01:46.760
- I don't want you to end up
on the wrong side of history

01:46.780 --> 01:49.520
with this one.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.520
- Okay.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.520
<i>- Joy was in,
so the next morning,</i>

01:53.520 --> 01:55.520
<i>I ordered
some weather balloons online</i>

01:55.520 --> 01:56.800
<i>and amassed a stockpile
of helium</i>

01:56.820 --> 01:59.520
<i>to conduct
a preliminary weight test.</i>

01:59.520 --> 02:01.520
<i>I discovered that
each helium-filled balloon</i>

02:01.520 --> 02:03.520
<i>I attached to me
would reduce my weight</i>

02:03.520 --> 02:05.520
<i>by 20 pounds,
so it was a simple matter</i>

02:05.520 --> 02:07.520
<i>of adding more
until each customer</i>

02:07.520 --> 02:09.520
<i>was below the weight limit,</i>

02:09.520 --> 02:10.600
<i>but I still had to factor in</i>

02:10.620 --> 02:12.620
<i>the harsh conditions
of the trail.</i>

02:13.520 --> 02:15.520
<i>You see, when Joy took me
along the route earlier,</i>

02:15.520 --> 02:16.760
<i>I noticed there were two things</i>

02:16.780 --> 02:18.520
<i>that could compromise
the balloons,</i>

02:18.520 --> 02:21.520
<i>the sharp branches
that hung over the trails</i>

02:21.520 --> 02:23.520
<i>and the razor-beaked birds
that were in the sky.</i>

02:23.520 --> 02:25.520
<i>If either one of them
came in contact</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
<i>with our balloons,</i>

02:26.520 --> 02:29.520
<i>the result would be disastrous.</i>

02:29.520 --> 02:31.520
<i>With a horse's life at stake,</i>

02:31.520 --> 02:33.520
<i>I wasn't gonna take any chances,</i>

02:33.520 --> 02:34.560
<i>so I came up with the idea</i>

02:34.580 --> 02:37.520
<i>of having two pizza-paddle-like
branch blockers</i>

02:37.520 --> 02:40.520
<i>that would protect the balloons
from any punctures.</i>

02:40.520 --> 02:41.520
Nice.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.880
<i>This would work well
for the trees,</i>

02:42.900 --> 02:45.520
<i>but unlike branches,
birds are a moving target</i>

02:45.520 --> 02:48.520
<i>that would require
a more precise approach.</i>

02:48.520 --> 02:50.520
<i>So I paid a visit
to a local gun shop</i>

02:50.520 --> 02:52.520
<i>to see if there were
any nonlethal ways</i>

02:52.520 --> 02:54.520
<i>to incapacitate a bird.</i>

02:54.520 --> 02:56.520
I'm looking
for a gun that will, like,

02:56.520 --> 02:59.520
stun a bird but not kill it.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.520
- Doesn't exist.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.520
Odds are, you're gonna
kill it or cripple it.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.520
<i>- I didn't want to kill a bird,
so I explained my entire plan</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:09.520
<i>to the clerk to see
if he had any other ideas,</i>

03:10.520 --> 03:11.760
<i>but that's when his mood soured.</i>

03:11.780 --> 03:14.520
- You want to suspend people
with helium balloons

03:14.520 --> 03:16.520
so that it alleviates
the weight of them

03:16.520 --> 03:17.520
on the back of a horse.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.520
- Yes.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.520
- I do not believe

03:20.520 --> 03:23.520
in this... in this
"hug the world" scenario

03:23.520 --> 03:25.520
that you're describing
where everybody

03:25.520 --> 03:28.520
has a right to do everything
just because they want to.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.520
- I disagree.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.520
I think anyone should
be able to do anything.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.520
- I do not have

03:34.520 --> 03:36.520
a "bubble gum and sunshine"
view of the world.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.520
<i>- Uh-oh! Uh-oh!</i>

03:37.520 --> 03:39.520
If people don't suffer
for their own stupidity,

03:39.520 --> 03:40.960
nobody learns.
- What was that sound?

03:40.980 --> 03:43.520
- Sorry, that was my...
- Oh.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.520
Cell phone telling me
there's a message.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.520
Let me put that on...
forgot to put that on silent.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.520
- It says "uh-oh" like that
every time?

03:49.520 --> 03:50.640
- Every time I get a message.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.520
- Do you have an option
of what it says?

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
- Yeah.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.520
- And you chose that?
- Yep.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.520
<i>- It was clear
this guy wasn't gonna help me</i>

03:57.520 --> 04:00.520
<i>find a way to protect
my balloons from birds,</i>

04:00.520 --> 04:02.520
<i>but that's when
it occurred to me</i>

04:02.520 --> 04:04.520
<i>that I might be able
to adapt a tool</i>

04:04.520 --> 04:06.520
<i>that farmers had been using
on the ground for years</i>

04:07.520 --> 04:08.520
<i>to the sky.</i>

04:08.520 --> 04:10.520
<i>A flying scarecrow.</i>

04:10.520 --> 04:13.520
<i>It was the nonviolent solution
I was looking for.</i>

04:13.520 --> 04:14.640
<i>So, with everything I needed,</i>

04:14.660 --> 04:16.519
<i>I could now head back
to Park Place Stable</i>

04:16.519 --> 04:18.519
<i>to put my idea to the test.</i>

04:19.519 --> 04:21.519
<i>I had found an overweight man
named Heath</i>

04:21.519 --> 04:23.520
<i>who was willing to try out
my concept.</i>

04:23.520 --> 04:25.520
<i>And after doing
an official weigh-in...</i>

04:25.520 --> 04:26.520
275.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.520
<i>I calculated it would take
exactly three balloons</i>

04:29.520 --> 04:31.520
<i>to bring him
under the weight limit.</i>

04:31.520 --> 04:33.520
<i>But as he started getting
strapped in,</i>

04:33.520 --> 04:34.840
<i>I noticed that
two other customers</i>

04:35.520 --> 04:36.960
<i>who had been booked
for the same ride</i>

04:36.980 --> 04:38.520
<i>were looking at Heath
and snickering.</i>

04:38.520 --> 04:40.520
<i>I had already explained to them</i>

04:40.520 --> 04:42.520
<i>that we were accommodating
an overweight customer,</i>

04:42.520 --> 04:45.520
<i>so this behavior
was completely inappropriate.</i>

04:45.520 --> 04:48.520
<i>So, before we headed out,
I decided to give them a talk.</i>

04:48.520 --> 04:51.520
Can I ask what's funny
about what we're doing here?

04:51.520 --> 04:54.520
- There's three massive balloons
ha... attached to a man.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.520
Right there.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.520
- I mean, this is the only way
he can ride a horse.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.520
Would you laugh at a wheelchair?

05:01.520 --> 05:03.520
I mean, that's a medical device
he's wearing.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.520
- Okay.
You're 100% right.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.520
- Right.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.520
Just because he's a larger man

05:09.520 --> 05:11.120
and hooked up
to giant helium balloons...

05:12.520 --> 05:13.680
- It doesn't mean...
excuse me?

05:13.700 --> 05:15.520
- It's not funny at all.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
- Right.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.520
'Cause if I see either of you
so much as smirk

05:20.520 --> 05:23.520
from this point forward,
your ride is over.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
Got it?
- Yes.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.520
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.520
- All right.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.520
<i>- With the normal riders
promising to be respectful</i>

05:32.520 --> 05:36.520
<i>and Heath now weighing in
below the 220-pound limit...</i>

05:36.520 --> 05:37.520
How does it feel?
- Good. Feels good.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.520
- Do you feel lighter?
- Yeah, I feel light.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.520
I feel good.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.520
<i>- It was finally time
for everyone to saddle up,</i>

05:41.520 --> 05:44.520
<i>so the ride could begin.</i>

05:44.520 --> 05:46.520
Great.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.520
<i>And I watched as,
for the first time in history,</i>

05:49.520 --> 05:52.520
<i>a plus-sized man
was able to ride a horse.</i>

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
<i>With my branch blockers
trailing close behind</i>

05:57.520 --> 06:00.520
<i>and the flying scarecrow
overhead,</i>

06:00.520 --> 06:02.520
<i>I felt that we were ready
for anything</i>

06:02.520 --> 06:04.520
<i>Mother Nature could throw at us.</i>

06:04.520 --> 06:06.520
<i>♪</i>

06:06.520 --> 06:07.520
<i>And it wasn't long</i>

06:07.520 --> 06:10.520
<i>until my balloon protection
system was put to the test</i>

06:10.520 --> 06:13.520
<i>as my branch-blocking team
raced into position</i>

06:13.520 --> 06:15.520
<i>to guide Heath
through a narrow clearing...</i>

06:15.520 --> 06:16.520
- You're good to go.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.520
<i>- And all we could do now
was pray.</i>

06:18.520 --> 06:23.520
<i>♪</i>

06:24.520 --> 06:26.520
<i>The system worked flawlessly,</i>

06:26.520 --> 06:28.520
<i>and for the rest of the trail,
tree after tree,</i>

06:29.520 --> 06:32.520
<i>my team was able to keep
the delicate balloons intact,</i>

06:32.520 --> 06:35.520
<i>making the ride a success.</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:41.520
<i>♪</i>

06:41.520 --> 06:45.520
<i>And as the evening fog rolled
in over the Malibu Hills,</i>

06:45.520 --> 06:47.520
<i>I couldn't help but feel
like it might just be</i>

06:47.520 --> 06:48.520
<i>the white breath of God,</i>

06:48.520 --> 06:51.520
<i>opening his mouth to say,
"Nice work."</i>

06:51.520 --> 06:53.520
<i>So I met up with Joy
to congratulate her</i>

06:54.100 --> 06:55.520
<i>on making history.</i>

06:55.520 --> 06:57.520
It's a big moment, right?

06:57.520 --> 06:59.520
- I guess, yeah.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.520
- Because of you,
overweight people

07:01.520 --> 07:03.520
all over the world
can now ride horseys.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.640
I mean, this is how you'll
be remembered when you die.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.680
- I'm not sure about that one,

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
but I hope I'm remembered

07:09.700 --> 07:12.510
for the World Championships
that I won,

07:12.520 --> 07:15.520
to be honest with you,
not for doing these balloons.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.520
- You should be proud
of this achievement, Joy.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.520
- I am extremely proud
of this achievement.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.520
- This is a good thing
to be remembered by.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.480
- Well, you know,
there are a lot of things that...

07:23.520 --> 07:25.520
and my... that I...
that I hope to be known for,

07:25.520 --> 07:28.150
especially horses and maybe,
you know, for my dogs,

07:28.520 --> 07:30.520
and, you know,
I did photography too, and...

07:30.520 --> 07:32.520
- No offense, I don't think

07:32.520 --> 07:35.520
anyone's gonna remember you
for that.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.520
- Hard to say.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.520
- Well, a legacy isn't always
something you get to choose,

07:40.520 --> 07:44.520
and I truly believe that this,
and only this,

07:44.520 --> 07:47.520
will be your legacy.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.520
And there is nothing more
to discuss about it.

07:55.150 --> 07:57.150
- If you're a regular viewer
of the show,

07:57.150 --> 07:59.390
you've probably noticed that
I have a keen sense of style

08:00.150 --> 08:03.150
that's both professional
and approachable.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.150
But I recently discovered
that by wearing

08:05.150 --> 08:07.150
one of my signature articles
of clothing,

08:07.150 --> 08:10.150
I may have unintentionally
committed a hate crime

08:10.150 --> 08:12.150
against the Jewish people.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.150
And that's not good.

08:15.150 --> 08:17.150
<i>My favorite jacket
for the last decade</i>

08:17.150 --> 08:19.150
<i>has been a windbreaker
made by Taiga,</i>

08:19.150 --> 08:22.150
<i>a popular outerwear company
based out of my hometown</i>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.150
<i>of Vancouver, BC.</i>

08:24.150 --> 08:26.150
<i>I love the jacket so much</i>

08:26.150 --> 08:29.150
<i>that I've worn it in nearly
every episode of my show,</i>

08:29.150 --> 08:30.270
<i>so you can imagine my horror</i>

08:30.300 --> 08:32.159
<i>when I recently discovered
that Taiga</i>

08:32.150 --> 08:35.150
<i>had published a tribute
to notorious Holocaust denier</i>

08:35.150 --> 08:38.150
<i>Doug Collins

08:38.150 --> 08:41.150
<i>amongst a selection
of fleece socks and balaclavas.</i>

08:41.150 --> 08:43.150
<i>When asked for comment
by a Jewish newspaper,</i>

08:44.150 --> 08:47.150
<i>the company refused
to explain their actions.</i>

08:47.150 --> 08:49.150
<i>My dad,
who is also a longtime fan</i>

08:49.150 --> 08:51.150
<i>of the German-engineered
windbreaker,</i>

08:51.150 --> 08:53.150
<i>was actually shamed
by a member of his synagogue</i>

08:53.150 --> 08:55.150
<i>for wearing the coat.</i>

08:55.150 --> 08:58.150
<i>- I think he wanted me
to rip the Taiga label off.</i>

08:58.150 --> 09:00.150
<i>He was really quite incensed.</i>

09:00.150 --> 09:03.150
<i>- And he had strong feelings
about me wearing it on TV.</i>

09:03.150 --> 09:04.910
- I don't think
you should promote a business

09:05.150 --> 09:06.150
that's anti-Semitic.

09:06.150 --> 09:10.150
<i>- It was clear I could never
wear my Taiga jacket again,</i>

09:10.150 --> 09:11.510
<i>but in searching
for a replacement,</i>

09:11.540 --> 09:14.160
<i>I realized I couldn't be sure
any of these other brands</i>

09:14.150 --> 09:16.900
<i>weren't hiding dark secrets
as well,</i>

09:17.150 --> 09:19.150
<i>so I decided
the only way to be safe</i>

09:19.150 --> 09:21.150
<i>was to start a jacket company
of my own.</i>

09:21.150 --> 09:23.150
<i>So, after coming up
with a cool name,</i>

09:23.150 --> 09:26.150
<i>Summit Ice, I had
a custom softshell jacket</i>

09:26.150 --> 09:28.150
<i>designed to my specifications.</i>

09:28.150 --> 09:30.150
<i>To undo the damage I'd done,</i>

09:30.150 --> 09:32.190
<i>I needed my brand
to stand for something,</i>

09:33.150 --> 09:36.150
<i>so I created a website
to help launch Summit Ice</i>

09:36.150 --> 09:39.150
<i>as the first outdoor apparel
company to openly promote</i>

09:39.150 --> 09:41.150
<i>the true story of the Holocaust.</i>

09:41.150 --> 09:42.150
<i>It was important to me</i>

09:42.150 --> 09:45.150
<i>that every single person
involved in the brand,</i>

09:45.150 --> 09:47.150
<i>down to the model I hired
for product shots,</i>

09:47.150 --> 09:49.150
<i>shared in
the company's core beliefs.</i>

09:49.150 --> 09:52.150
6 million Jews died
in the Holocaust, approximately.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.150
- Okay.

09:54.150 --> 09:56.030
- So how many Jews died, then,
in the Holocaust?

09:56.150 --> 09:57.190
- 6 million.
- Okay. Great.

09:58.150 --> 09:58.150
- Cool.
- Let's sell some jackets.

09:59.150 --> 10:00.150
- Okay.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.150
<i>- With a team
free of Holocaust deniers</i>

10:02.150 --> 10:03.150
<i>and professional photos</i>

10:03.150 --> 10:05.150
<i>that made the jacket
look really cool,</i>

10:05.150 --> 10:08.150
<i>I had nearly everything
I needed to begin marketing</i>

10:08.150 --> 10:11.150
<i>my softshell jackets
to the world.</i>

10:11.150 --> 10:13.150
<i>But for this brand
to have credibility,</i>

10:13.150 --> 10:15.150
<i>I'd need the support
of a Jewish leader.</i>

10:15.150 --> 10:19.150
<i>So I arranged a meeting with
L.A.-based rabbi Shalom Denbo</i>

10:19.150 --> 10:21.310
<i>and showed him my business plan
and marketing materials</i>

10:21.340 --> 10:23.160
<i>to get his guidance
on how to convey</i>

10:23.150 --> 10:26.150
<i>the core values of Summit Ice.</i>

10:26.150 --> 10:27.270
- See, "deny nothing," okay,

10:27.300 --> 10:29.300
you're not focusing
on something specific.

10:30.150 --> 10:31.470
- "Deny nothing"
is too ambiguous?

10:31.480 --> 10:33.480
- Yeah, you probably
want to have some image

10:33.480 --> 10:36.160
that immediately
focuses the viewer on,

10:36.150 --> 10:38.150
"There's something more
than just a jacket."

10:39.150 --> 10:43.150
Perhaps an image that
immediately identifies

10:43.150 --> 10:44.150
with the Holocaust.

10:44.150 --> 10:46.150
An armband.
- Right.

10:46.150 --> 10:47.150
- A swastika.

10:47.530 --> 10:49.160
- They should see images
of that?

10:49.150 --> 10:53.150
- Yeah, the ovens,
the... the gas chambers,

10:53.150 --> 10:55.150
the pits where they
lined them up to shoot them

10:55.150 --> 10:57.150
before the gas chambers.

10:57.150 --> 11:00.150
- But we're trying to sell
jackets too, right?

11:00.150 --> 11:01.150
- Yeah.

11:01.150 --> 11:02.350
You need to see images to know,

11:02.380 --> 11:05.160
you can't go through life
with your head in the sand.

11:05.150 --> 11:06.510
These things are real.
They happen.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.160
<i>- Rabbi Denbo suggested
having some sort</i>

11:08.150 --> 11:11.150
<i>of physical retail display
that could include</i>

11:11.150 --> 11:13.150
<i>educational materials
for consumers,</i>

11:13.150 --> 11:15.150
<i>so I reached out
to a local outdoor store</i>

11:15.150 --> 11:18.150
<i>whose manager seemed interested
in carrying our brand.</i>

11:19.150 --> 11:20.150
Just so you know, uh,

11:20.150 --> 11:22.150
our company's a strong supporter
of, uh,

11:22.150 --> 11:23.150
Holocaust awareness education.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.150
- Oh, neat, I didn't know that.
That's cool.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.750
- Just wanted to make sure
it's something

11:25.780 --> 11:27.140
you're comfortable with,
cool with.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.150
- Oh, for sure, yeah.
- All right. Cool.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.150
- Yeah. Absolutely.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.150
<i>- With the manager intrigued,
we set up a time</i>

11:31.150 --> 11:34.150
<i>for him to see our display
later that week.</i>

11:34.150 --> 11:35.670
<i>So we'll check back
with this in a bit.</i>

11:35.700 --> 11:38.160
<i>But first:
Susan Kim is the owner</i>

11:38.150 --> 11:40.150
<i>of Elizabeth Albert,
a boutique that sells</i>

11:40.150 --> 11:43.150
<i>some of the top women's
fashions on the Burbank strip.</i>

11:43.150 --> 11:46.150
<i>But lately, she's noticed
that sales have taken a dip.</i>

11:46.150 --> 11:47.150
- People are buying less,

11:47.180 --> 11:49.160
or they're really tightening
their belt.

11:49.150 --> 11:51.150
<i>- It could be because,
in a neighborhood</i>

11:51.150 --> 11:53.150
<i>populated largely
by young couples,</i>

11:53.150 --> 11:56.150
<i>Susan was forgetting
all about the men.</i>

11:56.150 --> 11:57.390
<i>So I paid her a visit with a way</i>

11:57.420 --> 11:59.160
<i>to keep couples happy
in her store.</i>

11:59.150 --> 12:02.150
To be honest with you, as a guy,

12:02.150 --> 12:03.270
this store is pretty boring.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.160
- 'Cause it's a women's store.

12:05.150 --> 12:06.150
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

12:06.150 --> 12:09.150
- So, if I came in here
with my girlfriend,

12:09.150 --> 12:10.510
hypothetically speaking...
- Mm-hmm.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.160
- I don't have a...
have a girlfriend...

12:12.150 --> 12:15.150
um, but...

12:15.150 --> 12:17.150
you know, I think
I'd be nagging her to leave.

12:17.150 --> 12:21.150
- 'Cause men
don't like to spend time

12:21.150 --> 12:24.150
in a women's clothing store
anyway.

12:24.150 --> 12:25.150
<i>- Until now.</i>

12:25.150 --> 12:27.150
<i>You see,
when a guy has nothing to do,</i>

12:27.150 --> 12:30.150
<i>the woman he's with
feels a psychological pressure</i>

12:30.150 --> 12:32.150
<i>to leave,
which will often keep her</i>

12:32.150 --> 12:34.150
<i>from staying longer
and buying more stuff.</i>

12:35.150 --> 12:39.150
<i>A dedicated Man Zone
where guys can chill and relax</i>

12:39.150 --> 12:40.150
<i>while the women shop.</i>

12:40.150 --> 12:43.150
- That's...
sure, that makes sense.

12:43.150 --> 12:44.390
- I mean, trust me, I know guys.

12:44.420 --> 12:46.160
All we need
is a beer in our hand

12:46.150 --> 12:48.150
and a bro by our side,
and we are out of the way.

12:49.150 --> 12:52.150
- I never...
I've, in fact, never heard

12:52.150 --> 12:53.150
any guy saying that.

12:53.150 --> 12:57.150
"If I had a brew
and a bro, I'm fine."

12:57.150 --> 12:59.150
- I totally hear you,
but leave it to me

12:59.150 --> 13:00.150
for the guy stuff.

13:00.150 --> 13:02.150
Trust me.

13:02.150 --> 13:03.150
- Okay.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.150
<i>- Susan was on board,
and we decided</i>

13:05.150 --> 13:08.150
<i>that her back storage area
would be the perfect spot</i>

13:08.150 --> 13:10.150
<i>for the new Man Zone.</i>

13:10.150 --> 13:12.150
<i>So the next day,
I had my team bring in</i>

13:12.150 --> 13:14.150
<i>all the essentials
to make this room</i>

13:14.150 --> 13:17.150
<i>the ultimate hangout den
for guys.</i>

13:17.150 --> 13:19.150
<i>And once everything
was in its place,</i>

13:19.150 --> 13:22.150
<i>all we had to do was wait
for the first couple to come in</i>

13:22.150 --> 13:24.150
<i>to see if my Man Zone
would work.</i>

13:24.150 --> 13:25.150
Just so you guys know,

13:25.150 --> 13:28.150
Elizabeth Albert has
a dedicated Man Zone,

13:28.150 --> 13:30.150
so that means
while the lady shops,

13:30.150 --> 13:31.430
you have a place
you can hang out

13:32.150 --> 13:33.470
that's both comfortable
and geared

13:33.500 --> 13:34.660
towards your masculine needs.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.150
So, if you wanna
come hang out there

13:37.150 --> 13:38.430
and let...
give her time to shop...

13:38.440 --> 13:39.440
You want?
It's up to you.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.160
- You do that, okay?
- Yeah.

13:41.150 --> 13:43.150
- Don't leave this, uh,
bro hangin', dawg.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.350
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.160
- Great, and we'll be having fun
in there,

13:46.150 --> 13:47.430
so take as much time
as you need.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.160
- All right, thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

13:49.150 --> 13:51.150
<i>I knew it wouldn't be
too much of a challenge</i>

13:51.150 --> 13:52.230
<i>to lure guys into the Zone,</i>

13:52.260 --> 13:55.160
<i>and once they saw it had
everything a guy could want,</i>

13:55.150 --> 13:58.150
<i>I was hopeful
they wouldn't want to leave.</i>

13:58.150 --> 13:59.390
Free at last, free at last, huh?

14:02.150 --> 14:03.150
I mean, do you feel free?

14:03.150 --> 14:05.150
- Yeah.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.470
<i>- Things were off
to a good start.</i>

14:09.150 --> 14:11.150
<i>The guy's girlfriend
was leisurely shopping,</i>

14:11.150 --> 14:12.150
<i>while back in the Zone...</i>

14:12.180 --> 14:14.160
You know what I feel like?

14:14.150 --> 14:16.150
A mother-effin' beer.

14:16.150 --> 14:20.150
<i>It was just boys being boys...</i>

14:20.150 --> 14:21.150
Nice catch.

14:21.150 --> 14:23.150
<i>Just two dudes doing
what guys do best...</i>

14:24.150 --> 14:25.150
Crack that shit.

14:25.150 --> 14:27.150
<i>Hanging out, grabbing a brewski,</i>

14:27.150 --> 14:29.150
<i>and watching
royalty-free football.</i>

14:29.150 --> 14:31.150
Oh, yeah.

14:31.150 --> 14:33.150
Tampa Bay Bandits
versus Houston Gamblers.

14:33.150 --> 14:35.150
Enjoy.

14:37.150 --> 14:40.150
Big tackle coming.

14:40.150 --> 14:41.150
There we go.

14:41.150 --> 14:43.150
<i>I thought
he was having a good time,</i>

14:43.150 --> 14:45.150
<i>but then,
something bad happened.</i>

14:46.150 --> 14:47.150
- I'ma go.
I'ma head out.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.150
- Okay.

14:48.150 --> 14:50.150
<i>The guy decided
to leave the Zone</i>

14:50.150 --> 14:53.150
<i>and go back to his girlfriend
after only four minutes.</i>

14:53.150 --> 14:57.150
<i>And even worse, moments later,
they left the shop entirely.</i>

14:57.150 --> 14:59.150
<i>This was not
what I had promised Susan.</i>

14:59.150 --> 15:01.150
<i>I worried that if I lost
another guy that quickly,</i>

15:02.150 --> 15:03.510
<i>there would be
no winning her back.</i>

15:03.540 --> 15:05.160
<i>So when the next couple came in,</i>

15:05.150 --> 15:06.430
<i>I had to somehow
figure out a way</i>

15:07.150 --> 15:08.550
<i>to keep the guy
chilling for longer,</i>

15:08.580 --> 15:10.420
<i>or else my Man Zone
didn't stand a chance.</i>

15:11.590 --> 15:12.670
- You know what I feel like?

15:12.700 --> 15:15.600
- Oh, yeah?
- A mother-effin' beer.

15:15.590 --> 15:18.590
Oop. Sorry.

15:18.590 --> 15:20.590
Just meant to do a little move.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.070
- Okay. Oh, cool.
- There you go, man.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.600
- I appreciate it, bro.
- Enjoy.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.670
<i>So far, things were working out
with my second guy...</i>

15:25.700 --> 15:26.600
- That's not good.

15:26.590 --> 15:27.590
- Gotta let it set.

15:27.590 --> 15:30.590
<i>As he was relaxed
and enjoying his beer.</i>

15:30.590 --> 15:33.590
<i>But when I put on
football again,</i>

15:33.590 --> 15:35.590
<i>for some reason,
this guy wasn't into it either.</i>

15:35.590 --> 15:37.590
Great touchdown celebration
coming up.

15:38.590 --> 15:40.590
Love that celebration.

15:40.590 --> 15:44.590
<i>Just a few minutes in, I could
tell I was losing him quick.</i>

15:44.590 --> 15:46.590
<i>And with his girlfriend
just starting to shop,</i>

15:46.590 --> 15:49.590
<i>I desperately needed
to turn things around.</i>

15:49.590 --> 15:51.590
<i>But that's when I realized
I hadn't yet bro'd down</i>

15:51.590 --> 15:55.590
<i>about the one thing
that's on every guy's mind.</i>

15:55.590 --> 15:57.150
You know what I like
more than anything?

15:57.180 --> 15:58.600
- What?
- Sex.

15:58.590 --> 15:59.790
- Se... oh, yeah.
Hell yeah, man.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.190
You can never get
too much sex, man.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.600
- Yeah, exactly.
- Never too much sex, bro.

16:03.590 --> 16:04.950
Oh, yeah.
- Definitely, definitely.

16:04.980 --> 16:07.600
- Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

16:07.590 --> 16:11.590
- What's your favorite,
uh, posish?

16:11.590 --> 16:13.590
- From the back.
- Hmm?

16:13.590 --> 16:15.590
- From the back, yeah.
From behind, yeah.

16:15.590 --> 16:16.950
- Oh, nice.
- Straight damage, bro.

16:16.980 --> 16:18.600
- Mine's missionary.
- Missionary?

16:18.590 --> 16:19.590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:19.590 --> 16:22.590
- Guy on top,
girl on the bottom.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.590
- There you go.
Nothing's wrong with that, man.

16:24.590 --> 16:25.630
Nothing's wrong with that.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.600
<i>- The sex talk was working,</i>

16:27.590 --> 16:29.590
<i>and the guy was loving
every minute of it.</i>

16:29.590 --> 16:30.590
Bareback or use a condom?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.600
- Oh, bareback, man.
I love the feeling.

16:32.590 --> 16:33.590
- Only way.
- All the way, bro.

16:33.590 --> 16:34.590
- Only way.
- Only way.

16:34.590 --> 16:35.590
- It feels much... so much better
without a condom,

16:35.590 --> 16:36.590
you know what I mean?

16:36.590 --> 16:37.590
- Aw, hell, definitely, dude.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.590
- It's like so much stuff
these days, it's like,

16:39.590 --> 16:41.590
"Oh, you gotta use protection,"
all this stuff.

16:41.590 --> 16:42.590
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- But, like, whatever.

16:42.590 --> 16:43.870
You pull out,
you're fine, right?

16:43.900 --> 16:45.600
- Absolute...
as long as you pull out, man.

16:45.590 --> 16:47.590
- As long as you pull out.
- That's the key.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.590
- Gotta pull out.
- Have to pull out, bro.

16:49.590 --> 16:51.590
You have to.
- Sometimes I get close.

16:51.590 --> 16:52.590
You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, like, "Whoo!"

16:52.590 --> 16:53.590
Almost got me right there!
- Sometimes I get real close!

16:53.590 --> 16:55.590
Yeah!

16:55.590 --> 16:56.590
- Exactly, bro.
- Yeah.

16:56.590 --> 16:57.590
<i>I did it.</i>

16:57.590 --> 17:00.590
<i>As long as we were talking
about sex,</i>

17:00.590 --> 17:03.590
<i>this guy wasn't going anywhere,
and best of all,</i>

17:03.590 --> 17:04.869
<i>his girlfriend
had time to browse</i>

17:04.900 --> 17:08.599
<i>every section of the store
without interruption.</i>

17:08.589 --> 17:10.310
- From behind, that's...
that's pretty much...

17:10.339 --> 17:12.599
I just like to see everything,
man, you know.

17:12.589 --> 17:14.589
You can't...
can't go wrong with that.

17:14.589 --> 17:16.589
<i>- The guy stayed in the Man Zone</i>

17:16.589 --> 17:18.589
<i>for a full 17 minutes
before leaving,</i>

17:18.589 --> 17:21.589
<i>and victory had never tasted
so sweet.</i>

17:23.589 --> 17:25.589
- Drinking a beer.

17:26.589 --> 17:27.589
- Yeah!

17:27.589 --> 17:28.590
<i>- And even though women</i>

17:28.590 --> 17:30.590
<i>may never really understand
what guys need...</i>

17:30.590 --> 17:32.590
- Why are you drinking beer?

17:32.590 --> 17:34.590
- Well, that's what guys do
when they're alone.

17:34.590 --> 17:36.590
- I don't care what they do
when they're alone.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.590
She left because he was
in there drinking beer.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.590
<i>- The only thing
that really mattered</i>

17:40.590 --> 17:42.590
<i>is that Elizabeth Albert
now had a place</i>

17:42.590 --> 17:44.590
<i>where guys could be themselves.</i>

17:44.590 --> 17:46.590
- There have been times
in my life

17:46.590 --> 17:49.590
when I was able to ejaculate
in another position,

17:49.590 --> 17:52.590
but especially as I've gotten
older and fatter,

17:52.590 --> 17:54.670
it's pretty much the only
position that works for me.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.700
- That makes sense.

17:58.930 --> 18:00.090
<i>- The day had finally arrived</i>

18:00.110 --> 18:02.920
<i>to pitch Summit Ice
to the manager of Adventure 16,</i>

18:02.930 --> 18:06.930
<i>so I had my team come in early
to set up an impressive display</i>

18:06.930 --> 18:08.930
<i>under the supervision
of Rabbi Denbo.</i>

18:08.930 --> 18:11.930
<i>I was a little hesitant about
some of the design elements,</i>

18:11.930 --> 18:14.930
<i>but it was crucial that
I follow the rabbi's guidance</i>

18:14.930 --> 18:16.930
<i>for such a sensitive
subject matter.</i>

18:16.930 --> 18:18.330
- And the mannequins
kinda stationed

18:18.350 --> 18:20.920
so that they are the bookends.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.930
- Right.

18:22.930 --> 18:25.930
<i>And before long, he felt like
it was ready to be unveiled.</i>

18:25.930 --> 18:27.930
- Definitely makes a statement.

18:27.930 --> 18:29.930
- Yeah, definitely.
- Definitely makes a statement.

18:29.950 --> 18:32.920
- Okay, I mean, I'm... I want
to follow your lead on this.

18:32.930 --> 18:35.930
- Yeah,
my only thing is just that

18:35.930 --> 18:38.930
that creates just a level
of uncomfort within me,

18:38.930 --> 18:40.170
and perhaps that's a good thing.

18:40.170 --> 18:41.370
<i>- So with the rabbi's blessing,</i>

18:41.390 --> 18:43.920
<i>it was time to bring in
Eric the manager</i>

18:43.930 --> 18:45.930
<i>to show him what Summit Ice
was all about.</i>

18:45.930 --> 18:47.930
- Um...

18:47.930 --> 18:50.930
A little bit much for a...

18:51.930 --> 18:53.930
I think that this mash-up

18:53.930 --> 18:58.930
of retail and history,

18:58.930 --> 18:59.930
it is a train wreck.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.930
I... I, um...

19:01.930 --> 19:04.930
<i>- Eric wasn't nearly
as enthused as I had hoped,</i>

19:04.930 --> 19:06.010
<i>so I brought in Rabbi Denbo</i>

19:06.030 --> 19:07.920
<i>to help explain our intentions
more clearly.</i>

19:07.930 --> 19:11.930
- Look, people go through life
with their head in the sand.

19:11.930 --> 19:14.930
Nobody wants to stand up
against evil.

19:14.930 --> 19:15.930
And you know what?

19:15.930 --> 19:17.930
People deny the Holocaust

19:17.930 --> 19:20.930
because they don't want to say
that evil exists.

19:20.930 --> 19:22.930
And we need to let people
know that.

19:22.930 --> 19:24.930
- Oh, my God,
this is so riddled with issues.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.930
You really think
the Holocaust deniers

19:26.930 --> 19:28.090
are the big softshell buyers?

19:28.110 --> 19:31.920
- The proceeds go to support
Holocaust awareness education.

19:31.930 --> 19:34.930
- This is a retail store,
and you don't learn

19:34.930 --> 19:37.930
about the darkest moments
of history in a retail store.

19:37.930 --> 19:38.930
- I beg to differ.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.930
The Gap had a whole campaign

19:40.930 --> 19:41.930
to make people aware
of breast cancer,

19:41.930 --> 19:43.930
so I don't think
there's a problem in...

19:43.930 --> 19:44.930
- It was actually AIDS.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.690
- AIDS, sorry, thank you.
- The RED campaign.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.920
- I have no faith in your
competence in this business.

19:48.930 --> 19:51.930
I have no faith
in your judgment whatsoever.

19:51.930 --> 19:53.930
The only thing I know
about your judgment

19:53.930 --> 19:56.930
is that it's... doesn't exist.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.930
- Well, I was...
I was kinda taking his lead.

19:59.930 --> 20:02.930
- Um... well...

20:02.930 --> 20:04.610
I'll let you get away
with a certain amount

20:04.630 --> 20:05.920
of liberty in saying my lead,

20:05.930 --> 20:07.930
but the idea
wasn't mine, Nathan.

20:07.930 --> 20:08.930
- Well, not for the jacket...
- The idea was yours.

20:08.930 --> 20:10.930
- But for the display.
- No... for the display.

20:10.930 --> 20:13.930
The display... I don't have
a problem with the display.

20:13.930 --> 20:16.930
<i>- Our sales presentation
didn't go well,</i>

20:16.930 --> 20:18.250
<i>and Eric said
he wasn't interested</i>

20:18.270 --> 20:19.920
<i>in carrying my product.</i>

20:19.930 --> 20:21.610
- Find something else
to do with your life,

20:21.630 --> 20:22.920
because you're not good at this,

20:22.930 --> 20:24.930
and you do not understand
the dynamics

20:24.930 --> 20:26.930
of people's emotions
and what offends them.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.930
<i>- It was a huge blow,
and I began to wonder</i>

20:29.930 --> 20:32.930
<i>if my line of softshell jackets
would ever take off.</i>

20:32.930 --> 20:34.050
<i>But at least I could be proud</i>

20:34.070 --> 20:36.920
<i>knowing that the people
who matter to me most</i>

20:36.930 --> 20:38.930
<i>could now walk the streets
of Vancouver</i>

20:38.930 --> 20:40.010
<i>with their heads held high.</i>

20:40.030 --> 20:41.920
<i>- Summit Ice!</i>

20:41.930 --> 20:43.930
- What do you think, huh?

20:43.930 --> 20:43.930
<i>- I love everything about it.</i>

20:43.930 --> 20:46.930
<i>A lot of zippers.</i>

20:46.930 --> 20:48.210
<i>Zippers are
very important to me.</i>

20:48.230 --> 20:50.920
<i>Yeah, 'cause all my change
falls out,</i>

20:50.930 --> 20:52.930
<i>and, you know,
I need stuff in there.</i>

20:52.930 --> 20:55.170
<i>Yeah, look at this, you can
loosen the sleeves too, or...</i>

21:00.420 --> 21:01.820
<i>- ♪ This is day one</i>

21:01.820 --> 21:02.820
<i>♪ Turn the music on</i>

21:02.820 --> 21:02.820
<i>♪ Hear the drummers drum</i>

21:02.820 --> 21:03.820
<i>♪ Reach up good and high</i>

21:03.840 --> 21:05.810
<i>♪ So alive</i>

21:05.820 --> 21:08.820
<i>♪ This is day one, one, one</i>

21:08.820 --> 21:11.820
<i>♪ This is day one,
one, one ♪</i>

21:11.820 --> 21:14.820
- Summit Ice.
Deny nothing.
