WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:04.589
Oh, my God!
Mom, the party is around the block.

00:04.714 --> 00:07.675
I'll be gone for two hours.
That is two hours you could spend studying.

00:07.759 --> 00:09.677
I have been studying
all weekend.

00:09.761 --> 00:12.722
No friends, no phone.
Just me alone with books.

00:12.805 --> 00:14.307
I feel like Alex.

00:14.390 --> 00:15.850
You're never alone
when you have books.

00:15.934 --> 00:18.061
Really? Is that what you
want me to turn into?

00:18.144 --> 00:20.355
Sweetheart, listen to me.
This is the S.A.T.'s, okay?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.607
It is not some
stupid science quiz.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.192
Hey, if science quizzes
are so stupid,

00:24.275 --> 00:26.069
why do you put mine up
on the refrigerator?

00:26.152 --> 00:28.530
Because we feel sorry for you,
'cause books are your friends.

00:28.613 --> 00:32.116
Yeah, she wasn't studying last night-
she was video chatting the whole time.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.619
I knew it. I knew it. Shut up!
You are such a tattle-

00:34.744 --> 00:37.121
Girls, take it down a notch,
because I- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:37.205 --> 00:40.208
What's the hot topic on
The Mew today, ladies?

00:40.291 --> 00:41.876
Dad, can you
just please tell Mom...

00:41.960 --> 00:44.504
that I can take a two-hour
break and go to a party?

00:44.629 --> 00:48.341
No, ma'am. I'm not stepping into that one.
We're not playing good cop/Mom.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.803
[ Knocking]
I got it.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.889
Hello.
You call for a plumber?

00:54.973 --> 00:57.725
- Uh, no, we did not.
- Oh, yes, we did. We did.

00:57.809 --> 00:59.269
- [ Phil ] We did?
- Plumber, hi. Yeah.

00:59.394 --> 01:02.272
Um, it's at the top of the stairs.
Really, Claire?

01:02.355 --> 01:03.940
Didn't I tell you
I'd fix the tub?

01:04.022 --> 01:06.359
Yes, you did. I think I was
pregnant with Luke at the time.

01:06.442 --> 01:10.113
That is not fair. I've done everything
you've asked me to do around here.

01:10.196 --> 01:13.116
I fixed the step, didn't I?
Look how solid it is.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.201
I'm like Shirley Temple
and that black guy.

01:15.326 --> 01:19.247
Bill “Bojangles” Robinson.
Bill “Bojangles” Robinson! I said it first.

01:19.330 --> 01:22.625
So this is the problem.
Uh, faucet just keeps leaking.

01:22.709 --> 01:25.336
Yeah, it's a cracked washer,
if I know my washers.

01:25.420 --> 01:27.130
And it's, uh, been
leaking a little water.

01:27.213 --> 01:28.715
Yeah, could be a washer,

01:28.798 --> 01:31.426
a cracked valve, a stripped pipe.

01:31.509 --> 01:33.928
Well, I guess I'm not
a professional plumber,

01:34.012 --> 01:36.598
but I have spent a huge
amount of time in that tub.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.642
I can tell you from experience, or at
least what it feels like in there.

[ Mitchell ]
Oh, good. You're back.

01:58.995 --> 02:01.998
I need you to help settle a spat between
our blacksmith and that chimney sweep.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.459
Be nice. It took me 20 minutes
to find my opera cloak.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.419
I still can't believe you didn't
have to rent any of that.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.670
Oh, please. Do you know
how many times this has paid for itself?

02:08.755 --> 02:09.839
Has it?

02:09.922 --> 02:12.175
Our friend Pepper loves
to throw theme parties.

02:12.258 --> 02:17.013
Yes, he does. And this weekend is his
first annual Oscar Wilde and Crazy brunch.

02:17.096 --> 02:20.725
We're still recovering from his
Studio 54th of July barbecue.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.477
They were fun at first.
Uh-

02:22.560 --> 02:24.646
But they have become
a lot of work.

02:24.771 --> 02:27.482
You have to dress in costume.
You have to assume a character.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.817
I- I can't believe
you ever dated him.

02:29.901 --> 02:34.197
One date. It was the '90s.
We'd just lost Princess Di.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.741
I was at sea.
[ Mouthing Words]

02:36.824 --> 02:39.869
Uh, Cam, can we just- [ Sighs
] Can we please cancel?

02:39.952 --> 02:43.498
[Sighs] I wish we could, but you know he's
still mad at us for missing Passover.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.084
Oh, right.
Seder Day Night Fever.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.669
Just go get dressed
and powdered.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.546
Oh. Pepper has done
the impossible-

02:50.630 --> 02:52.924
He's made two gay men
hate brunch.

02:58.429 --> 03:01.140
It might be easier just to pour
the espresso right in the sugar.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.934
[Chuckling]

03:03.017 --> 03:04.644
Every morning.

03:04.727 --> 03:07.105
Jay, what are you wearing?
You can't go to church like that.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.023
Well, that settles it then.
I'm going golfing.

03:09.107 --> 03:10.692
You're gonna
miss church again?

03:10.775 --> 03:12.860
Last Sunday, you said that
you had to go to the office.

03:12.944 --> 03:15.113
The week before, you had
breakfast with a friend.

03:15.196 --> 03:18.741
And before that, you thought you had a
cold that turned out not to be a cold.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.035
Because I babied it.
You don't have to convince us.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.329
You have to convince him.
Who, God?

03:23.413 --> 03:25.206
- Me and God are good.
- How would you know?

03:25.289 --> 03:28.000
Look, you feel God in church,
which is great.

03:28.084 --> 03:30.128
I feel God out in nature,
amongst his works.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.964
- Are you gonna go to church next week?
- We'll see.

03:33.047 --> 03:36.050
I know what “we'll see” means.
If you're done with church, just say it.

03:36.134 --> 03:38.052
- I'm done with church.
- Don't say that!

03:38.136 --> 03:41.222
Look, I'm not going to church any more.
It's not the end of the world.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.474
Let's not make a big deal out-
[ Rumbling ]

03:43.558 --> 03:45.184
- Ah, ah-
- Earthquake!

03:45.309 --> 03:47.228
¡Un terremonto!
¡Vamos, vamos, Manny! [Whimpers]

03:51.607 --> 03:53.443
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Okay.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.862
This is-
This is stuck.

03:55.945 --> 03:59.407
[Whimpering ] Oh, we're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

03:59.490 --> 04:03.911
We better not. If they find us in these
outfits, it's gonna be very bad for the gays.

We're okay.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.374
[Luke] Dad! Luke.

04:08.458 --> 04:11.002
Buddy. You okay?

04:12.003 --> 04:13.463
That thing
almost fell on me.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.923
I was sitting there, and it
came this close to my head.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.926
It's all right. You're okay.
You didn't get hurt.

04:19.010 --> 04:21.012
Well, I'm not gonna
wait around here until I do.

- Yeah, we're fine.

- Mitch, are you okay?
- We're okay. We're okay.

04:40.156 --> 04:44.202
- And Phil and Claire?
- I'm on the other line with them right now. One second.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.746
Hello?
Oh, shoot. We lost Phil.

Yeah. Of course I'm alive.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.722
[ Grunts ]
For now.

05:04.806 --> 05:09.310
For months, Claire has been
after me and dogging me-

05:09.393 --> 05:11.354
“Anchor the cabinet
to the wall.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.981
What if we have an earthquake?
We've got kids in the house.”

05:14.065 --> 05:16.984
Blah, blah, blah. So-
It finally reached a point...

05:17.068 --> 05:21.364
where I hand no choice but to just roll
up my sleeves and tell her I did it.

05:23.074 --> 05:24.659
[Grunts]

05:24.742 --> 05:25.993

On my way.

Well, uh, let's try this together, okay?
[Claire] Okay.

05:44.262 --> 05:45.680
Um, I'm gonna push-
you pull.

05:45.805 --> 05:49.267
Okay. On three. One, two, three-

05:50.434 --> 05:53.688
[Claire Grunts] Nothing.
Oh, dang it.

05:53.771 --> 05:57.191
Okay, here's the thing. I wasn't pushing.
In fact, I was pulling a little.

05:57.275 --> 06:00.027
It dawned on me that as long as
Claire was stuck in the bathroom,

06:00.111 --> 06:02.113
I'd have time to anchor
the cabinet to the wall.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.782
It's like they say, sometimes
when God closes a door,

06:04.866 --> 06:08.494
he closes it so hard
that your wife can't get out.

06:08.619 --> 06:12.123
So, don't panic. I'm gonna get you out.
I'm just gonna go get some tools.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.875
Get a crowbar,
if you have one.

06:13.958 --> 06:17.628
What is that supposed to mean?
Like I'm some dandy who doesn't have a crowbar?

06:17.712 --> 06:19.630
Well, you did
just use the word “dandy.”

06:19.714 --> 06:22.717
“Dandy” is a term coined by miners
in the 15th century.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.969
Phil?
Just get us out of here.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.267

get her out of there? Long time.

wherever you want.

of Tolerance. Fine.

nice to be around similarly dressed people.

That makes no-
The- The earthquake.

07:29.825 --> 07:33.371
Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes, this- Okay.

- Why? We're fine.
- Yeah, but Pepper doesn't know that.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.459
You'll just tell him that we have
some damage we have to deal with.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.337
- Why me?
- Because I'm the one that always cancels.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.464
- Do not hand me that. I will not talk to him.
- Hello?

07:43.547 --> 07:45.716
- I'm a bad liar. Do not hand me that.
- He's on. Pick up.

Well, the earthquake-
Yeah, it was huge here.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.273
So, obviously, we're not- we're
not gonna be able to make it.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.275
- Why not?
- Well, some dishes broke.

08:03.401 --> 08:05.903
You can sweep them up later.
And, um- Well, yeah, I guess-

08:05.987 --> 08:09.156
I guess we could
sweep those up, um, later.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.117

Our- Our hat rack-

08:11.200 --> 08:13.035
Our hat rack fell through the window.
Ha! rack?

08:13.119 --> 08:14.620
Well- Yeah, we do
have a hat rack.

08:14.704 --> 08:17.498
We thought it would force us to
wear our hats more. And it did.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.042
And there's water damage.
There's water everywhere.

08:20.126 --> 08:21.210
A bookshelf fell...

08:21.293 --> 08:22.878
on Mitchell's leg.

08:22.962 --> 08:25.506
Mitchell's hurt, Pepper.
Mitchell's hurt real bad.

08:25.589 --> 08:28.217
- I'm coming right over.
- No, you don't need to come over.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.011
- I'm coming.
- Pepper, no!

08:31.637 --> 08:34.181
- He's coming over.
- See? Kind of panicked.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.642
[ Sighs ] You did panic, Cam.
You panicked real bad.

08:41.272 --> 08:43.524
You're still going golfing?

08:43.607 --> 08:45.401
God sent you a sign, Jay.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.361
What, the earthquake?
You gotta be kidding me.

08:47.445 --> 08:51.365
You say that you're never going to church again,
and the ground shakes with a vengeance.

08:51.449 --> 08:54.076
I'll prove it to you.
God, if you have a problem with me golfing-

08:54.201 --> 08:55.703
Shh.
send me a sign.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.913
I mean, throw in a little lightning.
Put on a show.

08:58.039 --> 09:00.124
Don't talk to God like that!
Now, trust me,

09:00.207 --> 09:03.961
if God had a problem with me, he would let
me know without shaking the whole city.

09:04.045 --> 09:05.713
He would be
a little more specific.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.382
I'm not gonna argue with you.
I don't wanna get upset.

09:08.466 --> 09:09.967
Vamonos, Manny

09:10.051 --> 09:12.470
- I think I'm gonna skip it today.
- What?

09:12.595 --> 09:16.057
I like what Jay said about God being in nature.
No,no,no,no,no,no.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.185
Don't listen to him.
His days are numbered!

09:19.268 --> 09:21.479
Think about it, Mom.
It makes sense.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.732
God made the trees and the grass.
He didn't make that church.

09:24.815 --> 09:28.069
But he made the people that makes the
church, and you're making me angry!

09:28.152 --> 09:29.695
- Vamonos.
- Just one week.

09:29.779 --> 09:31.947
Can I go golfing with you?

09:32.073 --> 09:35.826
I'm probably gonna have a Latino kid carry
my clubs anyway. Might as well be you.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.621
Fine. See what I care.
Go.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.706
Manny, go change.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.666
Sorry, Mom.
Hope you understand.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.128
- Mmm.
- Probably good for us to spend a little time together.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.923
You're gonna spend
eternity together!

09:53.677 --> 09:55.179
Damn it!

09:56.388 --> 09:58.057
I suppose that was God too.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.768
I don't know who did it,
but it makes me happy.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.394
Ah!

10:04.814 --> 10:07.441
[Tool Whirring ]

10:07.525 --> 10:09.276
- What are you doing?
- Hey, buddy.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.071
Oh, just double-checking these straps.
This is an extra.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.657
These babies saved your life.
That's why this cabinet barely moved.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.784
It fell all the way to the couch.
Mm-mmm.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.494
- It almost killed me.
- No, it didn't.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.747
This cabinet barely moved.
That's just perspective playing tricks on your mind.

10:21.831 --> 10:24.416
Like, if I hold up my thumb,
it looks bigger than your head.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.169
- No, it doesn't. It looks tiny.
- You have to look at it from over here.

10:27.253 --> 10:29.380
How can I look at my head
from over there?

10:29.505 --> 10:32.174
[ Claire ] Phil?
Why don't you just lie down.

10:32.258 --> 10:34.552
I gotta make sure
your mom's still stuck.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.263
So she- I can get her out.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.640
Don't fall asleep.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.225
Sorry I took-

10:41.308 --> 10:42.893
You filthy-

10:42.977 --> 10:44.687
Sorry I took so long.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.439
I'm gonna go ahead and just
take off the doorknob, okay?

10:47.523 --> 10:49.316
- Okay.
- Here we go.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.610
[Whirring]
Oh, it's- Oh, damn.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.989
[ Claire ] What? What happened?
I, uh, brought the wrong screwdriver.

10:55.072 --> 10:58.242
- So I'll be right back.
- All right. But hurry up, Phil.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.910
Doing my best, Claire.

10:59.994 --> 11:02.580
Oh, don't talk back, Dad.
She'll just ground you!

11:02.663 --> 11:06.000
That's 32 weeks,
young lady!

11:06.083 --> 11:08.127
I was at 16 before, right?

11:08.961 --> 11:11.547
What?
Nothin'.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.175
Don't judge me until
you've had a teenage girl.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.218
I've had four of 'em.
God.

11:16.302 --> 11:18.262
How did you survive that?

11:18.345 --> 11:21.724
Girls were a piece of cake.
It was the boy.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.809
Every look on his face,

11:23.934 --> 11:26.395
every stupid decision
he made- Mmm.

11:26.478 --> 11:30.441
The way he sat there chewing
his food like an idiot.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.235
Then it hit me why
this kid drove me so crazy-

11:34.820 --> 11:36.864
He's me.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.241
Well, all the more reason
she should listen to me.

11:39.325 --> 11:41.744
I can stop her from
making the same mistakes.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.496
Did you listen to your mother?
No. God, no.

11:44.580 --> 11:50.044
But, you know, I had a reason.
That woman was a psycho control... freak.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.588
[ Luke ] Hey, Mom, I
brought you some soda.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.466
I couldn't find any straws, so
you'll have to drink it like cats.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.427
Oh, thank you, Luke.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.095
That's my sweetie.

12:00.179 --> 12:03.057
I was going to bring you wine, but you
finished the big bottle last night.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.850
Okay. Off you go.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.021
Hold this,
will you, kid?

12:09.104 --> 12:11.732
You know, Mitchell
used to caddie for me.

12:11.815 --> 12:15.027
Of course, he spent most of
his time chasing butterflies.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.862
You won't catch me doing that.
Good for you.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.907
I'm terrified of them.
Huh.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.492
Look at that.
That's a perfect shot.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.369
And I hit that with a bent club.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.747
So you're not worried about getting in trouble?
You know, with God?

12:26.830 --> 12:29.541
Oh, I think he's got
bigger things on his plate.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.337
So you're not
worried about hell?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.840
Let me let you in on a little secret, kid.
There is no hell.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.301
Seriously? No hell?

12:39.385 --> 12:41.345
That's fantastic.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.975
- So everyone just goes to heaven?
- Yep. End of story.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.938
Even bad people? Yeah, they're-
they're- They're in another section.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.731
See, they got
this thing figured out.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.316
Can I hit this?

12:59.863 --> 13:02.283
Damn it.
You distracted me.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.952
- I didn't say anything.
- I could hear you thinking.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.621
I'm thinking about this heaven of
yours that's full of bad people.

13:07.705 --> 13:10.207
Not full.
The tiniest fraction.

13:10.291 --> 13:12.960
- They're walled in.
- What if they break out?

13:13.043 --> 13:15.963
They're surrounded
by a lake of fire.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.840
There are fiery lakes
in heaven?

13:17.923 --> 13:19.758
This is turning into hell.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.887
Tell me about it.

13:28.517 --> 13:29.977
What are you doing?

13:30.060 --> 13:34.023
Well, you promised Pepper broken dishes, so...
I'm breaking dishes.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.233
No, not my frog.
I know you think it's tacky,

13:36.317 --> 13:39.903
but I happen to have won this at my first
4-H summer camp in a hollerin' contest.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.740
Well, we wouldn't have to break
anything if you were a better liar.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.951
If you're trying to make me feel bad
about not being as good a liar as you-

13:46.035 --> 13:49.121
- What are you doing?
- A hat rack fell through the window. Remember?

13:56.920 --> 13:59.506
I-I- I can't do this.
I quit.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.633
You might be comfortable with
all this lying, but I'm not.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.511
Oh, please.
Where was all this conscience...

14:04.595 --> 14:07.014
when I got us into the first-class
lounge at the airport...

14:07.097 --> 14:08.640
and you chewed
Angela Lansbury's ear off?

14:08.724 --> 14:10.809
You know what you are?
You're like a mob wife.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.519
You look down at me and my ways,

14:12.603 --> 14:15.439
but you're happy to wear the mink coat
that fell off the back of the truck.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.401

- I know. I know.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.868
It really hit us bad.

14:27.951 --> 14:31.455
No. I'm just always surprised
how small this place is.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.832
Pepper, you didn't have to leave
your party to come check on us.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.085
Great costume,
by the way.

14:36.168 --> 14:39.088
This isn't my costume.
I just threw this on to help you clean up.

Well, about your party-

14:41.131 --> 14:42.591
Oh, don't worry about canceling.

14:42.674 --> 14:46.428
At least you have an excuse,
unlike Steven and Stefan.

14:46.512 --> 14:48.222
They said they had the flu.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.933
Meantime, I just saw them out
riding their bicycle.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.851
Oh, Pepper,
that is horrible.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.561
I-I'm gonna
make you a cocktail.

14:54.645 --> 14:58.273
Oh, honey, don't go to any trouble.
I'll just have a Kir Royale.

to come to my party, just say it.

brought it up, Pepper,

to your party either.

so much work over the years, and- [ Sighs]

What if they send you
to the wrong place?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.963
They make mistakes
with paperwork sometimes.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.632
I was put in a girl's
health class last year...

16:05.757 --> 16:08.385

Calm down.

what heaven's gonna look like,

look like, who's where,

why don't we just concentrate on this beautiful,
carefree day that's in front of us?

16:21.273 --> 16:23.775
I'd rather concentrate
on something you just said.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.445
There might not even be a heaven?
I don't know.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.114
You seemed pretty sure
of yourself this morning.

16:29.198 --> 16:31.408
So what happens after you die?
There's just nothing?

16:31.492 --> 16:35.162
Look. You're focusing too much
on one little thing that I said.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.955
It was just a hunch, okay?

16:37.039 --> 16:39.958
A hunch? I'm skipping
church based on a hunch?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.377

- All right, all right. Don't freak out on me, kid.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.380
[ Hyperventilating ] You're playing
pretty fast and loose with my soul.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.549
Listen. I want you to forget
everything that I said, okay?

16:47.633 --> 16:49.760
Some things
can't be forgotten, Jay.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.222
Do you know what menstruation is?
Because I do.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.145
Perfect.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.064
- Hey-
- What-what are you doing?

17:02.189 --> 17:05.567
Aren't you supposed to be getting Mom out
of the bathroom? That is what I was doing.

17:05.651 --> 17:09.488
That is what I was doing.
This ca- This cabinet was the problem.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.906
- How?
- Yeah, it's very heavy.

17:11.990 --> 17:15.536
And because it was properly anchored to
the wall, it was sort of a ripple effect.

17:15.618 --> 17:19.164
It was pulling
part of the floor down...

17:19.248 --> 17:23.042
and then pushing part of the floor
up, causing the bathroom door-

17:23.126 --> 17:25.045

should happen,

didn't let me finish.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.657

to come to your party is-

All right. Go! Okay, go. Go! Go!

19:20.577 --> 19:22.371
Oh, got it! Got it!
Oh!

19:22.496 --> 19:24.581
It's moving! It did! All right.
All right. We got it.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.501
Thank God. Oh, thank God.
Thank God. Thank God. Go.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.378
Phil? Phil?

19:29.461 --> 19:31.463
Honey-
Phil, where are you? Phil-

19:32.756 --> 19:34.841
Are you kidding me?
Not the-

19:34.925 --> 19:35.926
Phil!

19:36.593 --> 19:38.053
Phil!
Hey.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.138
What happened to you?
You disappeared for 20 minutes.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.683
We just had to break ourselves
out of that bathroom.

19:42.808 --> 19:46.269
I am so happy to see you. Get in here.
Oh, no. No, no. Seriously.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.063
What happened?

19:48.146 --> 19:49.648
Dad was incredible.

19:49.731 --> 19:52.484
He was running around here,
turning off the gas line,

19:52.567 --> 19:56.279
cleaning up broken glass and taking
care of Luke after he ran into a wall.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.950
I got scared because
the cabinet didn't fall down.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.119
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.372
Um- [ Groans ] I'm sorry.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.207
Well, don't worry about it.
Um, I'm sorry.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.043
Don't. [ Chuckling ] I was so nervous.
I freaked out.

20:10.127 --> 20:12.379
It's all right.
It's all right.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.631
I think it was a little bit
of a rough morning. Yes.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.508
Wasn't it?
Yes, it was.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.511
I don't know about you guys, but I
just wanna relax and put my feet up.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.055
[Alex Clears Throat] At the
Museum of Tolerance. Who's in?

20:22.139 --> 20:24.891
I am! You are. Okay.
Let's do it.

20:26.977 --> 20:29.479
[ Jay ] There's nothing
mystical about an earthquake.

20:29.563 --> 20:32.399
Pressure builds,
and it's released

20:32.482 --> 20:34.234
[ No Audible Dialogue]

20:34.317 --> 20:36.903
And you just hope
there 1; not foo much damage.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.784
But it makes you realize what matters.
And for me, that's my family.

20:42.868 --> 20:46.204
- I'll put in a good word for you.
- You're the best, kid.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.789
My family and golf.

20:47.873 --> 20:50.167
[Laughs]

20:53.253 --> 20:55.714
Well, if heaven's in the sky,
what do you walk on?

20:55.797 --> 20:58.175
Manny, don't be ridiculous.
The clouds.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.636
That makes no sense. Clouds are air.
You'd fall right through them.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.556
The clouds in heaven-
they're like trampolines.

21:04.639 --> 21:07.392
I don't like trampolines.
They make me seasick.

21:07.476 --> 21:10.187
Manny, stop worrying.
Heaven is a beautiful place...

21:10.270 --> 21:14.983
with sunshine and rainbows
and butterflies.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.234
- Butterflies?
- Ay No, no, no, no, no.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.278
Ah! I didn't say butterflies.
[Crying]

21:18.361 --> 21:20.030
Manny, there's no butterflies!
