You must be Peter?

01:11.637 --> 01:13.273
Uh, yeah.

Yeah, that's me, I'm Peter.

02:09.262 --> 02:10.463
We'll have the driver waiting there

02:10.562 --> 02:13.133
and yeah, they'll have your name at

02:13.233 --> 02:15.468

Yeah.

02:22.408 --> 02:23.777
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.747
Yeah, and you know if whatever
you need after the flight,

02:26.847 --> 02:30.050
you know a bite to eat or
drink at the hotel bar,

02:30.350 --> 02:31.818
yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31.918 --> 02:34.487
Yeah, we've got that all covered.

02:34.587 --> 02:37.824
Oh, absolutely,
it's our pleasure.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.124
Yeah.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.835
- Did you get the draft
that I emailed to you?

02:50.736 --> 02:53.774
And you want me to add more sex?

02:53.874 --> 02:56.409
More tasteful sex.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.146
Yeah, okay.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.252
So you received the article,

03:10.290 --> 03:12.825
and you want me to rewrite it?

03:14.727 --> 03:16.930
No, you already posted it.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.900
Okay, well that's cool.

03:21.767 --> 03:25.972
No, yeah, no, I totally get that.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.876
Yeah, okay, great.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.024
- What?

04:20.326 --> 04:21.894
- What?
- You.

04:21.995 --> 04:25.031
Oh, she's here.
My Kate.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.732
- You're back.

04:26.832 --> 04:28.434
- Missed you.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.470
I'm back, I'm back, I'm so back.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.437
- Yes.

04:31.537 --> 04:34.240
- I'm so back.
- Oh my god.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.475
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.543
- Your hair grew
at least two inches.

04:37.643 --> 04:38.643
- Yeah.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.414
Your hair grew at least purple.

04:41.514 --> 04:42.949
- Yeah, I just woke up
and it was like this,

04:43.049 --> 04:47.053
I swear to God, I think
it's the water in Paris.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.254
- Wild times.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.489
- How are you?
Tell me about things.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.257
How's writing going?
How's everything?

04:51.357 --> 04:53.927
- Uh, writing is going.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.395
- Yeah?
- Slowly.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.031
Yeah, it sucks.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.533
- Well if you want me
to look over stuff,

05:00.633 --> 05:03.169
I love reading your stuff, so,

05:04.070 --> 05:04.905
just let me know.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.372
- I want to know about you.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.541
- Okay.
- Tell me.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.344
How was your crazy vacation?
- Oh my god.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.613
- Work? Everything?

05:13.713 --> 05:16.249
- I feel done, you know, good.

05:17.617 --> 05:20.520
- Yeah, you feel better
about everything with Sarah?

05:20.620 --> 05:25.525
- Yeah, I haven't said her
name in like six months.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.160
- That is fucking amazing.
- Yeah.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.862
- That's really great.
- It's good.

05:29.962 --> 05:33.299
I started seeing
someone recently.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.868
- Did you have a fun
little rebound in Paris?

05:35.968 --> 05:39.172
Did you find a little
Parisian hottie?

05:40.606 --> 05:43.944
- No, an Australian
from the gallery.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.611
A photographer, yeah.
- Is he here?

05:45.711 --> 05:46.446
- How fun.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.181
- Super fun. Nick.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.583
- That's a nice butch name.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.853
- For a man it's very butch.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.424
I'm dating a dude.

05:59.592 --> 06:00.793
- You're dating a dude?

06:00.893 --> 06:01.893
- Yeah.

06:02.995 --> 06:03.863
- That's crazy.

06:03.963 --> 06:05.298
You're currently dating a dude,

06:05.398 --> 06:07.133
or you had a thing with a dude?

06:07.233 --> 06:09.769
- I mean, we flew
back together so,

06:09.869 --> 06:10.971
I guess it's kind of a thing.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.872
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.575
I really want you
to meet him, too.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.043
- I would love to meet him.
- You guys would get along

06:17.143 --> 06:19.245
so well, like, I just

06:24.817 --> 06:28.354
I need you, actually, really
bad to make me look cool

06:28.454 --> 06:30.957
and pretty and fun because
I won't know anyone, please.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.425
- You always use me.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.259
Just go.
- I have to go to

06:33.359 --> 06:34.594
a work thing with Pete.

06:34.694 --> 06:35.561
- What time?

06:35.661 --> 06:36.661
- At eight.

06:38.364 --> 06:39.832
I'm fixing it.

06:39.932 --> 06:42.202
- No, you're messing it up.

06:43.369 --> 06:44.504
I think this is it.

06:44.604 --> 06:45.738
Hey, Lilly?

06:45.838 --> 06:49.509
- Oh, Em, Em, oh, it's
so good to meet you.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.011
- This is Kate, by the way.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.345
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

06:52.445 --> 06:53.279
- Has he told you any more?

06:53.379 --> 06:54.547
- No, I want to hear everything.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.250
- Like the most amazing
experience ever,

06:57.350 --> 06:58.518
we'll talk about it.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.353
Lilly's an amazing
aura photographer.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.989
This is her place, you have
an amazing place, by the way.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.224
- You do aura photography?

07:04.324 --> 07:05.058
- Mm-hm.

07:05.158 --> 07:05.958
- Like um...

07:06.058 --> 07:07.227
- Yup, like your aura.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.161
I'll tell you all
about it later,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.863
I'm feeling you're a bit orange.

07:11.697 --> 07:12.697
- Hey, hi.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.500
- Hey, babe.

07:15.568 --> 07:16.902
Jessie, Em. Em, Jessie.

07:17.002 --> 07:18.904
- Hi. Oh my god.
- Hi.

07:19.004 --> 07:20.040
- It's so
good to meet you.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.141
- It's good to meet you, too.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.308
- Pleasure.
- Nick?

07:22.408 --> 07:24.877
- Nick.
- Yeah, wow. Nice to meet you.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.446
- Nice to meet you,
thanks for coming.

07:26.546 --> 07:27.713
- Yeah, my pleasure.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.057
- Your organs in your body
have certain meridians

07:37.157 --> 07:40.993
and they emit an
electromagnetic frequency

07:41.093 --> 07:44.897
and the sensors that you put
your hands on pick that up.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.343
- Hey, you having fun?

07:57.443 --> 07:58.544
- I am.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.347
You're a very popular guy,
seems like.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.749
- Don't let appearances
deceive you.

08:03.849 --> 08:04.984
- Thank you.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.852
- Special rum soda
for you, cheers.

08:06.952 --> 08:08.188
- Cheers.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.822
- Pleasure.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.428
- This is plenty strong.

08:17.463 --> 08:18.664
- No, that's
not what it's called.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.134
- We have to see it.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.236
- You gotta wait 10 minutes.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.037
Anticipation is key.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.188
- Exactly, lay down.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.325
Yeah, go on your back.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.093
Go on your back.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.828
Yeah, that's great.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.146
- Not bad, not bad.

09:15.421 --> 09:18.124
- Here's to women.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.326
- To women, salud.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.731
- Don't leave me.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.501
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.336
I didn't, I wasn't,

09:30.436 --> 09:32.004
I just wasn't
looking at my phone.

09:32.104 --> 09:35.074
Em came back to
town early, I know,

09:36.442 --> 09:38.478
straight from Paris, yeah,
and she surprised me.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.880
I could take a cab over.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.448
Yeah, you sure?

09:42.548 --> 09:44.750
Because if you need
me there then...

09:44.850 --> 09:46.786
No, I won't be out too late.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.755
Yeah, you get back
in there, okay?

09:50.623 --> 09:51.857
Okay.

09:51.957 --> 09:52.957
I love you.

10:08.341 --> 10:12.144
- Ladies, I do apologize,
Kate has one of her

10:13.513 --> 10:15.815
best friends in town, there's
been kind of an emergency.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.049
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.251
- Unfortunately
she's not gonna make it.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.652
- Oh, I'm sorry.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.187
- She sends her apologies...
- Do you need to?

10:21.287 --> 10:23.623
- No, she's gonna be fine,
everyone is totally okay,

10:23.723 --> 10:25.525
but it's something that
she has to attend to,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.493
but I really hope you
get a chance to meet her,

10:27.593 --> 10:28.428
she's the best.
- Yeah, it's kind

10:28.528 --> 10:29.895
of a disappointment, we'll see.

10:29.995 --> 10:31.397
- Yeah.
- See how it plays out.

10:31.497 --> 10:33.533
- Fingers crossed, yes,
of course, of course, yeah.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.669
- She's keen on the idea
of moving to Seattle?

10:36.769 --> 10:38.271
- Absolutely, absolutely.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.072
Yeah, she's a writer.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.742
- I haven't had so
much fun since Em.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.724
- Babe, you okay?
- Go to sleep.

10:59.892 --> 11:00.892
No.

11:01.894 --> 11:02.894
- Babe?

11:05.998 --> 11:07.467
Are you drunk?

11:07.567 --> 11:08.401
- Yeah.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.404
- Come on, sit down, sit down.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.338
There we go.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.940
We're gonna get your shoes off.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.178
I'm gonna get you
some water alright?

11:19.278 --> 11:21.080
Oh, man. Okay.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.487
Okay, okay.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.523
- You don't think
I'm sexy anymore.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.993
- I think you're very sexy.
- No you don't.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.461
- I think you're very sexy.

11:35.561 --> 11:36.662
- No you don't.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.331
- You're very sexy
and you're very drunk.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.733
Okay, just lay down.
- No.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.134
- Yes.

11:42.234 --> 11:43.603
- I'm so drunk.
- Yes, there's that smile.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.306
Okay, I'm gonna
get you some water.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.240
- Em has a boyfriend now.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.542
- A boyfriend?
- Yeah.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.877
- Good for her.
Stay right there okay?

11:51.977 --> 11:53.713
- I said one shot.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.047
- Whatever you say, babe.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.949
Whatever you say.
- Stop.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.486
Stop, don't talk to
me like I'm stupid.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.188
- I'll be right back okay babe?

12:12.932 --> 12:13.932
Hello.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.837
Good morning, Katie.

12:19.905 --> 12:23.776
I have breakfast for you,
there's a whole world outside.

12:23.876 --> 12:24.876
Voila.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.145
- What?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.584
- How you feeling babe?
- Thank you.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.684
Awful.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.322
- You are a gorgeous,
gorgeous mess.

12:41.126 --> 12:42.161
- I'm sorry.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.930
- It's alright.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.032
- Did it go good?

12:47.132 --> 12:48.901
- Yeah, it went well.

12:50.135 --> 12:52.171
Yeah, yeah, it was good.

12:55.140 --> 12:57.677
So, Em's back in town.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.811
- Oh my god.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.215
Yeah, she's dating a man.

13:04.349 --> 13:06.652
- Yeah, you
told me last night.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.154
- Oh, it's super weird.

13:09.254 --> 13:10.356
- It's surprising.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.324
- Yeah.

13:12.424 --> 13:16.128
They invited us to go
up state this weekend.

13:16.228 --> 13:17.497
- Who?
- Can we go?

13:17.597 --> 13:18.631
Em and Nick.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.234
- What's up state?

13:22.334 --> 13:25.070
- He has
a cabin up there.

13:25.170 --> 13:26.406
- Yeah.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.973
Yeah, I'll leave work early.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.399
- Hello, pretty.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.467

13:54.567 --> 13:55.601
Hey, oh, hi.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.604

13:58.704 --> 14:01.507
- This fucking guy.
- You got it, girl.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.942
How are you, Em?

14:03.042 --> 14:04.243
- Six months.
- Good to see you.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.978
- You're handsome,
you're so tall.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.180
- I like the purple, I've
never seen the purple before.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.348
- Look at, you're such a man.
- It's my shoes.

14:09.448 --> 14:10.249
They're taller shoes.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.717
- Hey.
- Thank you.

14:11.817 --> 14:12.552
This is...
- Hey.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.753
- Hi.
- This is Nick.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.854
- Pete, nice to
meet you. Pleasure.

14:14.954 --> 14:15.788
- So good to meet you.

14:15.888 --> 14:16.589
- Thank you for having us.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.690
- My great pleasure.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.624
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.125
- You want a hand with the bags?

14:20.225 --> 14:21.060
- Yeah, sure.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.227
- No, I think we're pretty good.

14:22.327 --> 14:23.162
- You got that?

14:23.262 --> 14:24.396
- Yeah.

14:24.496 --> 14:26.365
- Okay, well, let me
show you the grounds.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.333
This is the east wing.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.304
- The east wing?

14:32.404 --> 14:33.639
Don't go into the west wing.

14:33.739 --> 14:34.874
- These are the gardens

14:34.974 --> 14:35.941
of enchantment.
- Gorgeous place.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.610
- Thank you.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.780
You can drop your bags,
drop your bags here if you like.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.816
- Oh wow, this is like
a proper log cabin.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.284
- Yeah.
- It's nice, right?

14:45.384 --> 14:46.719
- You know I found out
when I bought this place,

14:46.819 --> 14:48.654
it was actually a catalog
cabin from the 20's,

14:48.754 --> 14:50.255
so you'd actually go to a store,

14:50.355 --> 14:51.791
- Oh right, right.
- And buy a cabin,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.058
and they'd bring it to you.
- Then they send it to you.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.426
- Yeah, then they
build it for you.

14:54.526 --> 14:56.228
How crazy is that?
- It's really beautiful.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.396
- Yeah.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.198
- So Kate and I brought
this for you guys.

14:59.298 --> 15:00.733
It's a local guy.

15:00.833 --> 15:01.967
- That's so nice.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.302
- Just down the street
from our apartment.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.004
- Rose water infused gin.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.372
- Yeah, yeah, it's
a nice summery,

15:07.472 --> 15:08.774
refreshing.
- Great.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.643
Mate, thank you very much.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.577
I appreciate this.

15:11.677 --> 15:12.545
- Is it okay if I sit down?

15:12.645 --> 15:13.679
- Yeah, mate please.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.247
- Oh, guys, make
yourselves at home, man.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.217
- We tend to drink a
lot at this cabin, so,

15:18.317 --> 15:20.085
I'm sure once all
the whisky runs out,

15:20.185 --> 15:21.621
we'll get right into this stuff.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.122
- Well, it'll be
there for you, yeah.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.323
- That's great.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.423
Thank you.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.460
Oh man, yeah, look at that guy.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.895
- Wow.

15:29.995 --> 15:33.132
- I was gonna ask you whether
you got him by, you know

15:33.232 --> 15:34.600
hypnotizing him.

15:35.735 --> 15:36.736
- Oh, Crocodile Dundee?

15:36.836 --> 15:38.137
- Right, exactly.

15:38.237 --> 15:40.105
- Because he's Australian,
and I'm Australian

15:40.205 --> 15:43.242
and all Australians
do that, you know,

15:43.342 --> 15:46.712
that's Australia, is
that what you mean?

15:47.813 --> 15:48.813
- No.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.621
- I'm only fucking with you.

15:55.721 --> 15:56.856
I'm so sorry.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.323
- No, I'm sorry,
that was a dumb joke.

15:58.423 --> 15:59.825
- No, I know, it was a
dumb joke on my part.

15:59.925 --> 16:02.327
- You scared the hell out of
me, my heart's like going.

16:02.427 --> 16:03.896
That was stupid, though,
you're very different

16:03.996 --> 16:05.798
from Crocodile
Dundee, I assure you.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.701
- No, no, no, it's a fantastic
movie, personal favorite.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.536
- Oh, good,
good, yeah, me too.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.437
- I'm being a terrible
host, would you guys

16:12.537 --> 16:13.706
like to see the
rest of the place?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.074
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.742
- Yes, let's go.
- Alright, come follow me.

16:16.842 --> 16:18.778
- Follow this one.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.684
- This isn't bad, right?

16:24.784 --> 16:26.018
- No, it's beautiful.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.220
- Not bad at all.
- Right?

16:29.054 --> 16:30.222
Not too shabby.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.323
- I didn't even
see the jacuzzi there.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.725
- A little jacuzzi action later.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.526
- Yeah, you can get some
nice jacuzzi action.

16:34.626 --> 16:35.828
- Yes, please.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.331
A little rum in you.

16:44.436 --> 16:45.337
- Here it is.

16:45.437 --> 16:46.806
- Oh man.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.778
- It's like you're the only
one on this lake, it's amazing.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.380
- Yeah, I mean,
we've got them but

16:55.480 --> 16:56.616
I never see them.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.652
- Oh god,
it's so peaceful.

16:59.752 --> 17:00.820
- Wow.

17:03.122 --> 17:04.455
- You guys paddle board,
I got a paddle board.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.691
- Yeah.
- No.

17:05.790 --> 17:06.925
- I want to paddle
board tomorrow.

17:07.026 --> 17:07.859
- Yeah, we can take it
out tomorrow, for sure.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.761
- You'd have to teach us.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.295
- We can do that.

17:13.397 --> 17:14.700
- It's so nice.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.702
- Yeah, it's really pretty.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.628
- This is your room.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.929
- Nice.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.700
- Yeah, it gets
really bright in here.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.937
- That's cool.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.707
- Yeah, we went to this
estate sale yesterday,

17:54.807 --> 17:57.843
and they just had all
these postcards so

17:57.943 --> 18:01.814
I cleaned them out, Nick
let me do up the wall.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.316
- He let you do up
his wall and you've

18:04.416 --> 18:05.985
only been here a couple days?

18:06.085 --> 18:06.852
- Yeah.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.053
- Yeah.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.621
You're moving in.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.422
- Shut up.

18:26.405 --> 18:27.405
Hey.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.576
I want to show you something.

18:31.676 --> 18:32.676
- Okay.

18:33.712 --> 18:34.546
- Okay, we're turning.

18:34.646 --> 18:35.881
- Alright.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.349
- Alright.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.750
Open your eyes.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.091
Tiny room.

18:51.730 --> 18:52.765
- It's nice.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.632
- You like it?

18:53.732 --> 18:54.732
- Yeah.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.703
- I was drawing here yesterday.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.711
It's like a little loom of books

19:08.047 --> 19:09.715
keeping us safe.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.815
- Yeah.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.385
It's nice, yeah.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.294
- How are you doing?

19:23.295 --> 19:25.164
- Fine, just the same.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.265
You know?

19:28.968 --> 19:29.968
- Yeah.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.340
I um,

19:38.443 --> 19:42.314
found something the other
day in my apartment.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.360
- I remember this.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.565
I haven't thought about
that in a long time.

20:01.666 --> 20:04.003
- There's always this, you know?

20:04.103 --> 20:06.906
There's always us
and that house,

20:08.307 --> 20:12.011
and the three legged dogs
and your stupid grand kids.

20:13.145 --> 20:17.049
- Old Kate and old Em,
in their rocking chairs.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.524
You keep it.

20:25.624 --> 20:28.393
- I'll hold onto it,
to hold you to it.

20:28.493 --> 20:29.428
- It's a contract.

20:29.528 --> 20:30.796
- Okay.
- Cool.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.365
- I'll guard it with my life.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.803
- You're the best friend I got.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.677
- You are the best
friend I have.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.379
- I'm the only friend you have.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.217
- Hey Em.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.286
- I was not--
- Em.

20:54.386 --> 20:55.587
- What?

20:55.687 --> 20:57.356
- Did we use all
the kindling last night?

20:57.456 --> 20:58.456
- Yes.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.092
- Yeah?

21:00.192 --> 21:01.393
- Yes.
- Alright.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.864
Do you want to come help
me grab some kindling?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.231
- Yeah, where do we get that?

21:06.331 --> 21:07.066
- Outside.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.270
- Wasn't she a
housewife, then I mentioned

21:11.370 --> 21:12.704
he's like no.

21:12.804 --> 21:13.638
- Hey, we're
gonna grab some kindling.

21:13.738 --> 21:15.140
- I could kill people.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.475
- Find some kindling.
- Bye.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.509
Go be men.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.111
- Get it cowboy.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.211
Boy scouts.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.182
- Was Pete
ever a boy scout?

21:23.282 --> 21:26.685
- He was for like a year,
and then he got freaked out,

21:26.785 --> 21:28.854
he didn't like camping.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.389
- I can see that for sure.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.166
- Stop.

21:43.268 --> 21:44.136
- They were psychic.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.104
- Yeah, they were psychic.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.572
They would tell you the future.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.078
- I talked to her
and I was like,

21:53.178 --> 21:55.047
I was crushing pretty hard.
- Kate?

21:55.147 --> 21:58.884
- Yeah, I saw her and I used
my best line at the time

21:58.984 --> 22:02.521
which was like are you
friends with so and so,

22:02.621 --> 22:05.424
I think it was like, are
you friends with Chris?

22:05.524 --> 22:08.027
And she was like I don't
think you're talking about,

22:08.127 --> 22:10.795
and I was like oh, I really
had nothing after that, though.

22:10.895 --> 22:13.232
- That's pretty advanced
game, I feel like, for a...

22:13.332 --> 22:14.699
- Yeah, a freshman in college.

22:14.799 --> 22:16.635
- I would have been screwed
if you did know a Chris.

22:22.207 --> 22:26.411
- So yeah, I went in and
before I knew it, I was a,

22:26.511 --> 22:30.349
being a model in New York
which is the unlikely thing.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.451
- I always knew
I'd date a model.

22:32.551 --> 22:33.685
Always knew.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.955
- But I didn't have much
of a stomach for it.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.856
I just kept trying
to fuck all the

22:37.956 --> 22:39.591
models that I was working with.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.926
Then I realized that
they really wanted

22:41.026 --> 22:42.962
to fuck the photographer,
so I was like

22:43.062 --> 22:44.296
I'm gonna pick up a camera.

22:44.396 --> 22:46.298
I loved it and...

22:46.398 --> 22:47.832
- He's really good.

22:47.932 --> 22:49.101
- It's been good to me.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.869
- Well it led you to me.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.172
- That's very true.
That's very true.

22:53.272 --> 22:54.773
- Very glad it happened.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.077
I'm so fucking glad you
guys are here right now.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.378
- Hopefully
the first of many.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.780
- Yeah.
- It's so quiet here.

23:02.614 --> 23:03.949
Did you hear that Kate?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.049
- What?

23:06.251 --> 23:06.986
Outside?

23:07.086 --> 23:07.819
- Yeah.

23:07.919 --> 23:08.720
- No, what was it?

23:08.820 --> 23:09.621
- I don't know.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.123
Check it out.
- What?

23:11.223 --> 23:14.026
- Check it out.
- I'll check it out.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.695
- Did you hear the
sound of murder?

23:20.699 --> 23:22.001
Nailed it. Nailed it.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.902
- You guys think
that's funny every time.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.971
If you hang out with
them long enough,

23:26.071 --> 23:27.772
you see it coming
from a mile away.

23:27.872 --> 23:30.575
- So you guys have more of that?

23:33.445 --> 23:34.513
- Do I look confused enough?

23:34.613 --> 23:35.880
- You look so confused

23:35.980 --> 23:36.915
and it's beautiful.
- Are you getting the picture?

23:37.015 --> 23:38.950
- Oh my god, just wait for it.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.050
Smile.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.192
- It's like you time traveled.
- Yeah, look at that.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.393
- Can I see that?

23:48.493 --> 23:49.594
- Look at that.

23:49.694 --> 23:50.762
- Kate.
- I'm pretty sure...

23:50.862 --> 23:52.364
- Em told me you're a writer.

23:52.464 --> 23:53.298
- Yeah.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.134
- She's a great writer.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.935
- What do you write?

23:58.937 --> 24:00.672
- Mostly short stories.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.474
- Yeah?
- I do some blog work.

24:02.574 --> 24:03.975
- She's working on a novel.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.577
- I'm working on a novel.
- You're working on a novel?

24:05.677 --> 24:06.411
- Yeah.

24:06.511 --> 24:07.346
- Can we read the novel?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.913
- No.

24:09.013 --> 24:10.482
No, it's still a
work in progress.

24:10.582 --> 24:11.783
- How far through are you?

24:11.883 --> 24:13.252
- I'm, I mean...

24:15.086 --> 24:17.689
- She's very
secretive about it.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.691
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.160
- She shared with me a...
- No it's fine.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.728
It's not like I don't like...

24:25.964 --> 24:27.065
I mean, yeah.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.402
It's just kind of like
process is such a weird thing.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.803
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'm sure.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.173
- As an artist so...

24:38.810 --> 24:41.012
- It rolled off the table.

24:42.447 --> 24:46.951
- Let's just say in what world
do I go again, in this game?

24:47.051 --> 24:47.786
- Yeah.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.488
- Alright, fuck it.

24:51.456 --> 24:54.159
- Is this one of Nick's?

24:54.259 --> 24:57.529
- Uh, yeah, what his
girl or his photo?

24:58.730 --> 25:00.265
- Either, both?

25:00.365 --> 25:01.400
- Both, yes.

25:02.367 --> 25:03.367
- Yeah.

25:04.068 --> 25:05.504
Is that weird?

25:05.604 --> 25:08.607
- Um, no, I mean, yeah
it's totally weird

25:08.707 --> 25:11.843
to be surrounded by beautiful
photos of naked women.

25:11.943 --> 25:13.245
I hate it, I hate it.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.846
- No, but it's weird.

25:14.946 --> 25:15.780
What about this one?

25:15.880 --> 25:17.048
Did he fuck this one, too?

25:17.148 --> 25:18.783
- Yeah, I think so.

25:19.884 --> 25:21.786
But look at her, I mean,
who could blame him?

25:21.886 --> 25:23.488
- I don't know, it would
make me really uncomfortable

25:23.588 --> 25:26.125
like dating someone that
takes naked photos of me,

25:26.225 --> 25:28.260
or like hooking up with
someone and then just like

25:28.360 --> 25:31.630
lives amongst the
photos in their home.

25:32.997 --> 25:35.700
- Yeah I mean, I don't know.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.602
He took photos of me.

25:38.503 --> 25:39.271
- Serious?

25:39.371 --> 25:40.505
- Yeah.

25:40.605 --> 25:42.741
- You let him take
naked photos of you?

25:42.841 --> 25:46.044
- Yeah, I mean, it was Paris and

25:46.144 --> 25:47.779
I don't know, it was
like in the morning

25:47.879 --> 25:51.750
and I was in his bed and
he just took them so,

25:52.784 --> 25:56.087
it was weirdly
comfortable actually.

25:56.187 --> 25:58.190
You totally missed
that by the way.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.124
- What?

25:59.224 --> 26:00.325
- I didn't get an applause.

26:00.425 --> 26:01.726
- Oh I'm so sorry.

26:01.826 --> 26:03.795
Well it's because I
got this, once again.

26:05.697 --> 26:07.666
- Thank you. Phew.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.279
- How long have you
and Kate been together?

26:20.379 --> 26:21.246
- Five years.

26:21.346 --> 26:22.080
- Five years.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.180
- Yeah.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.250
- Wow.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.385
- Yeah, it's getting
up there I guess.

26:26.485 --> 26:28.253
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:28.353 --> 26:31.256
You and Em seem to
really hit it off.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.291
- Yeah.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.892
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:33.992 --> 26:35.160
We kind of have.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.862
- Yeah, I gotta say,
you don't look like

26:37.962 --> 26:40.399
the other people she's dated.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.535
- Yeah, I'm sure you must have
gone through a bit of that--

26:43.635 --> 26:44.635
- Yeah.

26:45.570 --> 26:46.570
Oh yeah.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.211
It's an exciting change of pace.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.945
- Yeah, I think so.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.059
- Hello, Kate.

27:08.159 --> 27:09.361
- Hello, Pete.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.176
What do you think of
Em's new boyfriend?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.247
- Well he's a man, not a woman.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.350
That's what I first noticed.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.183
- Yeah?

27:32.283 --> 27:33.283
- Yeah.

27:34.218 --> 27:35.654
- What else?

27:35.754 --> 27:37.489
- Well he seems, um,

27:38.523 --> 27:40.525
he's very welcoming.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.894
I won't have to look at
any porn while I'm here

27:42.994 --> 27:44.863
because I can just
like walk the walls.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.665
- Yes, there you go.

27:46.765 --> 27:47.899
There you go.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.671
- But hey, I mean if, taking
pictures got you this place,

27:52.771 --> 27:55.940
I shouldn't have
gone into business.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.410
- It's not too late,
you can change.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.678
- Hm mm.

27:59.778 --> 28:00.912
- Yeah, do you want
me to pose for you?

28:01.012 --> 28:04.115
- Nah, I can't take
pictures for crap.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.620
- It's overrated.

28:11.289 --> 28:13.592
- What do you think of him?

28:14.526 --> 28:16.194
- I don't know.

28:16.294 --> 28:17.294
Kind of

28:18.663 --> 28:20.365
I think he's kind of creepy.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.102
- Maybe he invited
us up here just to

28:24.202 --> 28:26.104
murder us one by
one in the woods.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.706
- You know that's what
I've been thinking.

28:29.674 --> 28:32.944
- Well it's good
to see sweet Em.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.579
It's been a while.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.416
Tons of fun.

28:37.516 --> 28:38.516
- Yeah.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.488
- It's quiet.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.856
- What?

28:44.956 --> 28:45.990
- It's quiet.

28:46.090 --> 28:47.426
- It's quiet here.

28:47.526 --> 28:48.793
- Just the crickets.

28:48.893 --> 28:49.893
- Yeah.

29:16.655 --> 29:21.192
They're like right on the
other side of the wall.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.794
- We can be quiet.

29:22.894 --> 29:24.663
- I can be quiet.

29:24.763 --> 29:25.697
- I can be quiet.

29:25.797 --> 29:26.831
- You can't.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.000
- We could try.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.234
- You're the worst.

29:30.334 --> 29:33.638
- There's a first
time for everything.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.912
- Maybe tomorrow night.

29:41.012 --> 29:42.814
- Maybe tomorrow day.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.984
- Maybe tomorrow night.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.543
- Did you brush your teeth?

30:15.113 --> 30:16.481
Get it in there.

30:17.348 --> 30:18.917
- Get the back.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.619
Get right in there.

30:21.452 --> 30:23.221
- You're really cute.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.325
I think I swallowed
all the toothpaste.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.597
- It is though,
it's totally art.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.833
- Yeah, it's a new idea,
but it actually happened.

31:08.933 --> 31:10.334
Katie.

31:10.434 --> 31:12.036
- Hi.
- Sleepy girl.

31:13.572 --> 31:14.606
How are you?

31:15.974 --> 31:17.008
She's tired.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.077
Good morning.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.211
- Good morning.

31:20.311 --> 31:21.746
- Hi.

31:21.846 --> 31:23.381
How did you sleep?

31:23.481 --> 31:24.516
- Good.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.218
- And there you are Madam.

31:27.318 --> 31:28.453
We should go.

31:28.553 --> 31:32.123
- Yes, we're gonna go
buy breakfast foods.

31:32.223 --> 31:32.991
Bacon.

31:33.091 --> 31:33.825
- Bacon.

31:33.925 --> 31:34.925
- Bacon.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.662
- A little bacon on the side.
- Bacon.

31:37.762 --> 31:38.597
Great.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.965
- Be right back, babe, okay?

31:42.533 --> 31:45.604
- Nick's on a run so just
tell him where we are.

31:45.704 --> 31:46.437
- See you babe.

31:46.537 --> 31:47.572
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:41.519 --> 33:42.253
- Hi.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.521
- Hi.

33:43.621 --> 33:44.789
- How you doing?

33:44.889 --> 33:48.159
- Good, sorry, I was
looking for tampons.

33:48.259 --> 33:51.830
- Em keeps them in the bathroom
so probably just there.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.698
How you doing?
- Good, how was your run?

33:53.798 --> 33:55.166
- Great.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.000
- Good.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.001
- You sleep all right?

33:57.101 --> 33:58.502
- I slept really good.

33:58.602 --> 34:00.138
- Hey, where are the guys?

34:00.238 --> 34:01.873
- They went out to
the grocery store

34:01.973 --> 34:03.507
to get some stuff for
breakfast, I think

34:03.607 --> 34:06.244
they're gonna get
some bacon and eggs.

34:06.344 --> 34:07.245
- Okay, good.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.780
Yeah, I think we
ran out of that.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.081
- Yeah.

34:12.016 --> 34:13.016
- Sorry.

34:13.985 --> 34:14.786
Get my band here.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.219
- Go for it.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.889
I'm gonna make myself some
coffee, do you want some coffee?

34:17.989 --> 34:19.556
- Yeah, I'd love some
coffee, thank you.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.260
- I'll make some coffee.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.665
- Oh I leave and everyone
stops eating bacon,

34:26.764 --> 34:27.732
I see how it is.

34:27.831 --> 34:29.100
- Turkey bacon.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.601
It's just as good.
- You can never leave again.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.335
- Just as good.

34:32.436 --> 34:34.304
What'd you do this morning?

34:34.405 --> 34:36.708
- Uh, just sat and read a book,

34:36.808 --> 34:41.279
sat on the couch, pined away
hopelessly missing you guys.

34:41.379 --> 34:42.714
- I know.

34:42.813 --> 34:46.449
- And we had that conversation
upstairs, that was good.

34:47.284 --> 34:48.284
- Yeah.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.992
- You know that
supermarket is so big.

34:55.293 --> 34:56.293
Oh my god.

34:57.495 --> 34:58.997
I'm so used to these
tiny bodegas in New York,

34:59.097 --> 35:00.531
it's just so
refreshing to have all

35:00.631 --> 35:03.334
those options, all that space.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.136
- Alright.
- Alright.

35:06.104 --> 35:06.838
Ready?

35:06.938 --> 35:08.372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:08.472 --> 35:12.276
- Is there like a trail or
are we just free styling?

35:12.376 --> 35:14.946
- You don't have any
health issues right?

35:15.046 --> 35:17.148
- I don't like heavy breathing.

35:17.248 --> 35:19.183
I don't like breathing too hard.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.719
- That's not what Kate told me.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.689
- You're
such a little brat.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.731
- We're gonna jump on your
back, too, is that alright?

35:32.831 --> 35:35.599
- I'll fucking do it,
I'll do it.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.854
- Echo!

36:29.988 --> 36:32.556
- In horror movies, the original
is always better. Always.

36:32.656 --> 36:33.792
- In most cases that's true.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.526
- Evil Dead.

36:35.626 --> 36:36.527
Come on man.
- That's the one

36:36.627 --> 36:39.430
that you're choosing that...

36:39.530 --> 36:40.464
- Would you like some?

36:40.564 --> 36:41.432
- What is it?

36:41.532 --> 36:43.001
- It's whisky.

36:43.101 --> 36:44.168
- No I'm good.

36:44.268 --> 36:45.003
- You sure?

36:45.103 --> 36:45.837
- Yeah, thank you.

36:45.937 --> 36:46.937
- Okay.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.579
- You know I'm actually
really impressed that

36:55.679 --> 36:59.350
you even got her out here
since she hates hiking.

36:59.450 --> 37:03.354
- Yeah I know, but I sold
it to her as a nature walk.

37:03.454 --> 37:04.355
- Yeah?

37:04.455 --> 37:05.857
- It all worked out in the end.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.993
- Yeah, I mean, usually it's
just the beach or nothing.

37:09.093 --> 37:10.228
- Oh yeah?

37:10.328 --> 37:11.729
- Yeah, we used to go
to the beach almost

37:11.829 --> 37:13.965
every weekend back in college.

37:14.065 --> 37:18.269
She dragged me out there with
her chesterfields and her 40

37:20.204 --> 37:21.572
and her ukulele.

37:22.706 --> 37:23.474
- Ukulele?
- Jeffrey.

37:23.574 --> 37:24.642
Yeah.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.577
- She had a ukulele
named Jeffrey?

37:26.677 --> 37:28.179
- Yeah, you didn't know
that she played the ukulele?

37:28.279 --> 37:29.113
- I didn't.

37:29.213 --> 37:30.048
- Yeah, she's really good.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.415
- That's great.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.319
- Hey, Em.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.520
Remember Jeffrey?

37:36.620 --> 37:38.456
- Yeah, my ukulele?

37:38.556 --> 37:39.556
Yes.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.093
Oh, I miss him.

37:42.193 --> 37:45.163
- I didn't know you
played the ukulele.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.398
- She plays the guitar,
she plays the ukulele.

37:47.498 --> 37:48.232
- Are you good at it?

37:48.332 --> 37:50.034
- She's really good.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.370
You want to get up
and I'll get this?

37:52.470 --> 37:53.371
- Sure.

37:53.471 --> 37:54.605
- Okay great.

37:55.539 --> 37:56.640
- Wow.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.877
Just goes to show you, right?

38:09.787 --> 38:10.821
- Em.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.192
Does this look frumpy?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.361
- No, I think you look cute.

38:17.461 --> 38:20.398
- No it looks like
a maternity suit.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.000
- I have a bikini
if you want one.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.634
- Yes, please.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.436
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.573
- See if it
fits your boobies.

38:29.673 --> 38:30.474
Let me see.

38:30.574 --> 38:31.509
- Oh I like this.

38:31.609 --> 38:32.776
- Not bad.

38:32.876 --> 38:33.878
- Great.
- Let's go.

38:33.978 --> 38:34.978
- Alright.

38:35.679 --> 38:36.414
- I love you.

38:36.514 --> 38:37.748
- I love you too.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.717
- Do I look like
some surfer dude?

38:39.817 --> 38:43.221
- You're taking
your time up there.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.924
- I might.
- I think you should.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.791
I'm gonna get a beer.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.368
Weren't expecting that shit.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.213
You guys gonna
come in the water?

39:09.313 --> 39:10.714
- Oh third down across?

39:10.814 --> 39:12.416
- Yeah, yeah, you want to
get in the water, babe?

39:12.516 --> 39:13.651
- No, I'm good.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.419
- Oh, come on.
- You sure?

39:15.519 --> 39:16.254
- I don't want to get wet.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.355
- Come in the water.

39:17.455 --> 39:18.722
- Yeah, come with us.
- I'm fine.

39:18.822 --> 39:19.757
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, go in.

39:19.857 --> 39:20.925
- Last chance, dance.

39:21.025 --> 39:21.859
- You're gonna
come in aren't you?

39:21.959 --> 39:23.194
- Yeah.
- Yeah you are.

39:23.294 --> 39:24.362
- She's
not gonna come in.

39:24.462 --> 39:26.730
- That's alright. Alrighty.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.601
- Win there, babe, would you?

39:31.735 --> 39:33.104
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, not over there.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.038
- What?

39:34.138 --> 39:35.073
- Stay on this side of this.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.840
There's rocks out there.

39:36.940 --> 39:37.775
- Got it.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.410
- Yeah don't dive off there.

39:39.510 --> 39:40.644
Al right.

39:40.744 --> 39:41.779
- I haven't dived in ages.
- Ready?

39:41.879 --> 39:42.746
- On three.

39:42.846 --> 39:43.581
- On three.

39:43.681 --> 39:44.848
Alright.

39:44.948 --> 39:47.418
- One, two, three.
- One, two three.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.290
- Whew. Isn't that nice?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.390
- Yes!

39:54.225 --> 39:55.659
- It's a party, Pete.

39:55.759 --> 39:59.463
- Well that's that sweet
cold natural water.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.100
She should get in.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.367
She should really get in.

40:03.467 --> 40:04.868
- Let's get her in.

40:04.968 --> 40:06.104
- This is your idea.
- She can thank us later.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.338
- This is your idea.

40:07.438 --> 40:08.439
- Hey, hey,
follow my lead.

40:08.539 --> 40:09.607
You want a beer?

40:09.707 --> 40:10.441
- Yeah, I'll have one.

40:10.541 --> 40:11.275
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:11.375 --> 40:12.843
- Alright.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.026
How's your day, how's it going?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.360
- Good.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.594
- You getting some answers?

40:30.694 --> 40:31.895
- Yeah, you good at
crossword puzzles?

40:31.995 --> 40:32.830
- I'm pretty good.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.898
- What are you doing? No don't.

40:34.998 --> 40:35.899
Stop.

40:35.999 --> 40:37.168
- Alright.
- Stop.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.002
Do not throw me in.
- It's happening.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.237
- No, do not, do not.

40:39.337 --> 40:40.504
Put me down, put me down.

40:42.406 --> 40:43.406
- Woo hoo!

40:46.810 --> 40:49.079
- God. You fucking asshole.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.382
- Babe, it's alright.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.650
- It's fun, Kate.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.884
- Just hang out
in the water now.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.586
- I said I didn't want
to fucking get in.

40:55.686 --> 40:57.121
- But babe, you can
just hang out in here.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.189
- I'm sorry.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.090
- I thought it was funny.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.224
It was my fault.

41:00.324 --> 41:02.693
- Fuck. Leave me alone. God.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.330
You guys need to grow up.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.645
- Hi.

41:54.745 --> 41:56.013
- Hey.

41:56.113 --> 41:57.181
- Can I come in?

41:57.281 --> 41:59.149
- Yeah, please.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.820
- I just wanted to
apologize for earlier

42:02.920 --> 42:04.288
for freaking out at you.

42:04.388 --> 42:05.389
- Absolutely don't have to,

42:05.489 --> 42:06.790
I'm sorry that I threw you in.

42:06.890 --> 42:08.159
That was stupid.

42:08.259 --> 42:09.960
- It's totally fine.

42:11.161 --> 42:13.030
- Do you want to come in?

42:13.130 --> 42:13.897
- Yeah, is it okay?

42:13.997 --> 42:15.133
- Absolutely.

42:15.233 --> 42:18.136
I'd love you to, I'd
love your opinion.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.236
- Nice.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.672
I don't want to bother you.
- No please.

42:21.772 --> 42:22.673
- I know you're doing work.
- Look around. Got for it.

42:22.773 --> 42:23.507
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:23.607 --> 42:25.643
Absolutely, be my guest.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.336
What do you think?

42:54.338 --> 42:58.542
- These are a lot
of really gorgeous ladies.

42:59.377 --> 43:00.043
- Yeah.

43:00.143 --> 43:01.345
- Yeah.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.515
Oh, I recognize this one.

43:06.116 --> 43:07.485
She was at your party.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.453
- Yeah, that's Jessie.

43:11.355 --> 43:14.224
- Was she a former
lover of yours?

43:18.028 --> 43:21.231
- Uh, well, yeah,
we've had sex before

43:22.600 --> 43:26.003
but she's a very, very,
very dear friend of mine.

43:26.837 --> 43:29.273
- So this is like your thing.

43:30.341 --> 43:31.709
These naked women.

43:31.809 --> 43:34.111
- Uh yeah, well...

43:34.211 --> 43:35.346
- It's your art.

43:35.446 --> 43:38.115
- I guess I've done
a bit of that but

43:38.215 --> 43:40.484
I'm gonna try and
move forward into more

43:40.584 --> 43:43.153
kind of portraiture from now on.

43:43.253 --> 43:44.588
- Cool.

43:44.688 --> 43:46.957
Do you want a test subject?

43:49.393 --> 43:50.561
- Really?

43:50.661 --> 43:51.995
- Yeah, I can do it.
Do you want a model?

43:53.196 --> 43:55.999
I've never modeled
before but I could try.

43:56.099 --> 43:58.502
- I would love to
but, just so you know

43:58.602 --> 44:01.104
the whole process is
really designed to

44:01.204 --> 44:03.607
kind of break down a
barrier so I don't want

44:03.707 --> 44:05.543
to make you
uncomfortable in any way.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.479
- No, I won't feel, as long
as I can keep my clothes on,

44:08.579 --> 44:10.348
I'm totally cool,
I would be game.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.216
- There's no
danger of that, I promise.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.651
- Okay, cool.

44:13.751 --> 44:14.485
- Really?

44:14.585 --> 44:15.586
- Yeah.

44:15.686 --> 44:16.687
I'm totally game.

44:16.787 --> 44:18.222
Do you want to do it now?

44:18.322 --> 44:19.457
- Sure, have a seat.

44:19.557 --> 44:20.458
- Alright.

44:20.558 --> 44:21.759
- Shut this.

44:21.859 --> 44:22.859
- Yes.

44:27.297 --> 44:29.032
- Okay so just
take whatever position

44:29.132 --> 44:32.436
you like that feels comfortable.

44:32.536 --> 44:33.671
- Sitting.

44:33.771 --> 44:35.773
- Sitting,
great, perfect.

44:35.873 --> 44:37.308
Just hold there while I focus.

44:37.408 --> 44:38.609
- Okay.

44:46.149 --> 44:47.149
- Perfect.

44:48.285 --> 44:50.454
Normally when I do
this I ask a lot of

44:50.554 --> 44:52.890
introductory questions, kind
of get to know you stuff

44:52.990 --> 44:55.259
but I feel like
we're past that so

44:55.359 --> 44:56.827
we'll just get into it.

44:56.927 --> 44:57.661
- Okay.

44:57.761 --> 44:59.162
- Okay?

44:59.262 --> 45:02.199
I feel like you don't
trust me and that's fine,

45:02.299 --> 45:04.167
that's absolutely fine
but I just wanted to know

45:04.267 --> 45:07.705
if I was right or not
in that assessment.

45:08.806 --> 45:09.940
- Sorry are you
asking me a question

45:10.040 --> 45:11.842
for like the photo thing

45:11.942 --> 45:13.076
or are you just
asking me a question?

45:13.176 --> 45:14.712
- Yeah, yeah, it's
all part of it.

45:14.812 --> 45:17.548
- Alright, why do you think
that I don't trust you?

45:17.648 --> 45:20.384
- Just from what
I've felt with you

45:20.484 --> 45:21.985
being around Em and I,
I just wanted to know

45:22.085 --> 45:25.222
if that was something I
was right or wrong about.

45:25.322 --> 45:28.626
- I mean, if I'm gonna
be totally honest,

45:28.726 --> 45:30.461
and that's like
what this thing is,

45:30.561 --> 45:34.365
I've seen Em get burnt a
lot of times in the past

45:34.465 --> 45:36.066
by people that she's dated.

45:36.166 --> 45:37.768
- So is it Em's judgment
that you don't trust

45:37.868 --> 45:39.937
or is it me as a person
that you don't trust?

45:40.037 --> 45:41.204
- I don't really know you.

45:41.304 --> 45:42.573
I mean, what I do
know about you is

45:42.673 --> 45:45.876
that you've known Em
for a very short time,

45:45.976 --> 45:50.113
that you are a man, that
you take photos of women

45:51.515 --> 45:55.352
who you have slept with and
keep naked photos of them up.

45:56.820 --> 45:58.322
- So is it the idea
of sexuality in

45:58.422 --> 45:59.957
general that you
have a problem with?

46:00.057 --> 46:02.993
- No I don't feel uncomfortable
about sexuality at all.

46:03.093 --> 46:05.329
I feel good about my
sexuality, I feel good

46:05.429 --> 46:08.031
about my best friend's
who has her own sexuality

46:08.131 --> 46:09.333
and is a very sexual person.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.601
- Is that why you
two are friends

46:10.701 --> 46:12.269
so that you can have
a vicarious kind of

46:12.369 --> 46:13.771
experience through
Em's sexuality?

46:13.871 --> 46:15.373
- No, and I think that's
really insulting that you

46:15.473 --> 46:17.375
would assume that that's why
I would be someone's friend.

46:17.475 --> 46:19.076
- I'm not trying to insult
you I'm just asking.

46:19.176 --> 46:21.244
- No, that is not it.

46:21.344 --> 46:22.713
I like to keep different,

46:22.813 --> 46:24.648
I like to have friends that
are different from me for sure,

46:24.748 --> 46:25.583
and that's--

46:25.683 --> 46:26.884
- I'm not gonna take your photo.

46:26.984 --> 46:28.118
- Why?

46:28.218 --> 46:30.153
- Because I feel like
there's still something

46:30.253 --> 46:32.490
between you and I, I feel
like you're not quite

46:32.590 --> 46:33.957
fully letting me in yet.

46:34.057 --> 46:36.627
- No, I feel like I am, and
I'm being very honest with you.

46:36.727 --> 46:38.629
- It's okay.
- I'm being very clear about

46:38.729 --> 46:40.130
how I feel about things without

46:40.230 --> 46:41.465
giving you any bullshit answers.

46:41.565 --> 46:42.866
- I understand.
- Because that was the thing

46:42.966 --> 46:44.267
that you wanted right?
- It's a very difficult thing

46:44.367 --> 46:45.436
to be vulnerable.
- You wanted people to be

46:45.536 --> 46:46.637
really honest so
that's what I'm doing.

46:46.737 --> 46:47.304
- Look if you're not
ready for it, it's fine.

46:47.404 --> 46:48.105
- Yeah, okay.

46:48.205 --> 46:49.272
- It's absolutely fine.

46:49.372 --> 46:50.474
I want you to be
totally comfortable--

46:50.574 --> 46:51.742
- I think it's really
insulting that you

46:51.842 --> 46:53.243
would say that I'm
not ready for it,

46:53.343 --> 46:54.712
when I feel like I'm a person
that lives a very authentic

46:54.812 --> 46:55.846
and honest life all the time.
- I just feel like I can't

46:55.946 --> 46:57.314
take your photo.
- You just keep talking

46:57.414 --> 46:58.382
over me, you don't even
let me say what I'm saying.

46:58.482 --> 46:59.883
- I'm trying to--
- No.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.051
I feel totally comfortable.
- I'm not gonna take your

47:01.151 --> 47:01.985
photo because
you're scared of me.

47:02.085 --> 47:04.254
- I'm not fucking scared of you.

47:06.957 --> 47:09.493
- That was great, that was it.

47:10.794 --> 47:11.729
Thank you.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.597
- Oh, you're welcome.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.342
- I'm so proud of you.
Are you kidding me?

47:25.442 --> 47:26.777
- Yeah.
- Oh my god. That's amazing.

47:26.877 --> 47:30.280
Holy shit.
- Oh my god, oh my god, what?

47:30.380 --> 47:31.849
- SGI called.

47:31.949 --> 47:33.551
- Yeah?

47:33.651 --> 47:34.918
- They offered me the position.

47:35.018 --> 47:37.921
- Oh my god, oh,
my god, that is though.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.757
- Yeah, babe, we're doing this.

47:39.857 --> 47:40.891
- Yes.
- This is happening.

47:40.991 --> 47:42.325
- Yes.

47:42.425 --> 47:45.696
- They offered me a two
bedroom apartment in Seattle,

47:45.896 --> 47:48.899
company car,
transportation package,

47:48.999 --> 47:51.869
everything's covered,
they want us there next week.

47:53.069 --> 47:54.337
This is fast.

47:54.437 --> 47:55.438
This is gonna happen.

47:55.538 --> 47:56.706
- Oh my god.
- Is this okay?

47:56.806 --> 47:57.875
- Yes, this is so good.
- Is this okay?

47:57.975 --> 47:59.643
- This is so, so, so, so good.

48:00.043 --> 48:01.078
So good.

48:01.178 --> 48:02.813
- Holy fucking shit.
- I know, I know, I know.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.314
- We're there, babe.
- I know, it's so good.

48:04.414 --> 48:07.084
- We're fucking there.
- Yes.

48:07.184 --> 48:09.119
- Put it there, huh?

48:09.219 --> 48:10.488
I love you.

48:10.788 --> 48:11.889
- I love you.

48:11.989 --> 48:14.223
- Oh my god, our lives just changed.
- Yeah.

48:15.058 --> 48:16.126
- I gotta call my parents.

48:16.226 --> 48:17.961
- Yeah, go, go, go call them.

48:18.061 --> 48:19.296
- I fucking did it.

48:19.396 --> 48:21.198
- Call Melinda.
- Should we do shots?

48:21.298 --> 48:22.232
- Yes.
- Yes.

48:22.332 --> 48:23.601
- Like straight away.

48:23.701 --> 48:24.935
- Yes. Yes, yes.

48:25.035 --> 48:25.836
- Give me five minutes.

48:25.936 --> 48:27.170
10 minutes.
- Go.

48:27.270 --> 48:29.172
- 15 minutes.
- Go, I'm so proud of you.

48:29.272 --> 48:30.941
- Oh my god.

48:31.041 --> 48:33.477
- This is crazy.
- Wow, that's...

48:33.577 --> 48:35.345
Next week is like whoa.

48:36.947 --> 48:40.250
- Get coffee, and Nick and I
will have to just visit and...

48:40.350 --> 48:41.350
- Yeah.

48:42.352 --> 48:43.352
Seattle.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.857
Soon be a Seattle citizen.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.461
Come on, come.

48:51.561 --> 48:52.496
Get some shots.
- Drinks?

48:52.596 --> 48:53.731
Alright, alright.

48:53.831 --> 48:56.667
Alright, let's do
this. Let's do this.

48:57.735 --> 49:00.137
Open all his fucking windows.

49:01.504 --> 49:05.776
- Hey, I just wanted to
say sorry about before.

49:05.876 --> 49:07.945
- No, don't, that
was really fine.

49:08.045 --> 49:08.879
- Are you sure?

49:08.979 --> 49:11.682
- So sure and I hope that,

49:11.782 --> 49:12.950
I think it's a
really cool project

49:13.050 --> 49:16.019
so I hope that it works
out really good for you.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.155
- It means so much to
Em that you're here

49:18.255 --> 49:20.357
and I'm really
happy you're here.

49:20.457 --> 49:22.192
- One, two, three, seven.
- One, two, three, seven.

49:22.292 --> 49:23.393
- Fuck.

49:23.493 --> 49:24.895
- One, two, three, 10.
- One, two, three.

49:24.995 --> 49:26.997
- One, two, three, 10.
- One, two, three.

49:28.832 --> 49:30.601
- Where's
his chest hair at?

49:30.701 --> 49:33.436
- I'm just trying to embrace

49:33.536 --> 49:35.773
one day at a time, you know?

49:35.873 --> 49:37.140
You know?

49:37.240 --> 49:38.842
- Here you go.

49:40.443 --> 49:43.547
- That's bringing
back memories isn't it?

49:43.647 --> 49:45.549
Whenever you're ready.

49:45.649 --> 49:48.185
Oh my god, look at you.

49:57.494 --> 50:00.731
- Don't ever make
me miss you again.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.199
- I will try.

50:02.299 --> 50:03.934
- It's like $23.75.

50:06.937 --> 50:09.172
- It's my birthday today.

50:09.272 --> 50:11.241
- Cool, man, happy birthday.

50:11.341 --> 50:12.676
- Do you want
to take a shot, Mark?

50:12.776 --> 50:14.177
- Do you want to
take a shot, Mark?

50:14.277 --> 50:16.179
- Nah, I can't, I'm sorry.

50:16.279 --> 50:18.882
- Yeah, Mark!
- Happy birthday!

50:18.982 --> 50:20.017
- Thank you.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.322
- Guys and with that I gotta go.

50:27.590 --> 50:29.893
Thanks for the hospitality.

50:30.828 --> 50:31.962
- I've never been fishing.

50:32.062 --> 50:32.830
- You want
to catch a fish?

50:32.930 --> 50:34.031
- I would love to.

50:34.131 --> 50:37.667
- Do you, Pete, want
to go fishing tomorrow?

50:39.002 --> 50:41.104
- I, Nick, absolutely do.

50:42.272 --> 50:43.473
Is that a promise or are
you just saying this?

50:43.573 --> 50:44.307
- You want to go
fishing tomorrow?

50:44.407 --> 50:45.643
- Don't mess with me.

50:45.743 --> 50:48.611
- I'm not messing with you.
- No playing.

50:49.646 --> 50:51.514
- Let's play sardines.

50:52.415 --> 50:54.017
- Let's play sardines.

50:54.117 --> 50:55.518
- What's sardines?

50:55.618 --> 50:57.287
- Alright, you turn off
all the lights in the house

50:57.387 --> 50:58.722
and it's like hide and seek.

50:58.822 --> 51:00.457
- But backwards.
- But only one person,

51:00.557 --> 51:02.660
exactly, only one person hides

51:02.760 --> 51:05.095
and then everyone goes
to find the person

51:05.195 --> 51:07.130
and then when you
find the person

51:07.230 --> 51:09.967
you hide with them
like a sardine,

51:10.067 --> 51:11.635
and then the next
person hides with them

51:11.735 --> 51:14.738
until there's only one person
left looking for everybody.

51:14.838 --> 51:15.973
Count to 60.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.207
- Alright turn
all the lights off.

51:17.307 --> 51:20.543
- One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

51:20.643 --> 51:22.746
- 47, 48, 49.

51:22.846 --> 51:24.047
- You're up to 49 already?

51:24.147 --> 51:25.949
- 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,

51:28.886 --> 51:30.487
55, 56, 57, 58, 59,

51:33.791 --> 51:34.791
60!

52:03.753 --> 52:04.753
Em?

54:15.953 --> 54:18.989
- Holy
schnikes, I found you.

54:25.428 --> 54:27.965
I didn't want to be the loser.

54:49.752 --> 54:52.222
- My grandma says
that tuna salad helps.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.724
You want some tuna?

54:55.993 --> 54:56.993
You want some tuna?

55:00.197 --> 55:01.664
- You're so mean.

56:23.680 --> 56:26.716
- I'm getting hot,
I'm going inside.

57:01.718 --> 57:02.852
Hey.

57:02.952 --> 57:04.154
- Hi.

57:04.254 --> 57:05.955
- I just got so hot.

57:09.826 --> 57:10.826
- Crikey.

57:12.061 --> 57:13.863
What is this?

57:13.963 --> 57:17.234
Oh my goodness,
it's an Em crocodile.

57:17.334 --> 57:18.701
- Camouflage.

57:18.801 --> 57:21.804
- It's an Em
crocodile, oh my god.

57:21.904 --> 57:22.972
Never, oh my god.
- You're doing such

57:23.072 --> 57:24.141
a good job.

57:24.241 --> 57:26.943
- All my days being
an Australian.

57:28.978 --> 57:30.113
- Don't.
- Did I ever

57:30.213 --> 57:33.950
in all my days find such
a beautiful specimen?

57:34.050 --> 57:36.053
Check out my big biceps

57:36.153 --> 57:37.620
and my big cabin.

57:40.257 --> 57:41.591
Show me your tits.

57:41.691 --> 57:43.626
I'm gonna take your
photograph to fuck you.

57:43.726 --> 57:44.527
Take your tits out.

57:44.627 --> 57:46.629
- Is that how it works?

57:46.729 --> 57:48.498
Is that how it works?

57:49.466 --> 57:50.667
- Nice.

57:51.834 --> 57:53.636
I don't even need
to see your face.

57:53.736 --> 57:55.238
Just boobs.

57:55.338 --> 57:56.773
Okay, three, two,

57:58.208 --> 57:59.309
and one, yes.

58:01.811 --> 58:02.811
Alright.

58:06.048 --> 58:06.783
Got it.

58:06.883 --> 58:08.351
- Don't break it.

58:10.553 --> 58:12.689
- Armpit juice will
make it really good.

58:12.789 --> 58:14.391
- Gotta get that juice on there.

58:14.491 --> 58:17.794
- That's a secret, for
all of his photographs.

58:17.894 --> 58:19.829
He puts his armpit,
and then he just gets

58:19.929 --> 58:21.898
all snuggled up.
- And then he lies down

58:21.998 --> 58:23.700
on them like this.

58:23.800 --> 58:28.037
And then my 19 year old self
is freaking out right now.

58:28.137 --> 58:29.137
Oh my god.

58:31.508 --> 58:33.610
- I loved 19 year old Em.

58:34.744 --> 58:35.612
- She liked you.

58:35.712 --> 58:37.414
- If I had meant it.

58:45.922 --> 58:47.390
The crocodile Em.

59:04.140 --> 59:06.309
- I think that's a bad idea.

59:06.409 --> 59:07.744
I think that's a bad idea.

59:07.844 --> 59:08.578
- Are you sure?

59:08.678 --> 59:09.812
- Yeah.

59:09.912 --> 59:11.381
- I think it's not.
- I'm pretty sure it's

59:11.481 --> 59:13.015
a really bad idea.

59:19.322 --> 59:20.322
Oh shit.

59:36.739 --> 59:37.739
Oh my god.

59:49.286 --> 59:50.853
- Taste the freshness.

59:50.953 --> 59:52.622
- Em's dad.

59:52.722 --> 59:53.456
- You're kidding?

59:53.556 --> 59:54.291
- Yeah, he did.

59:54.391 --> 59:55.658
Hey, fish, we got fish.

59:55.758 --> 59:57.494
- Ladies, gather round.

59:57.594 --> 59:58.594
Fish!

59:59.496 --> 01:00:01.598
- Get up, get up, get up.

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:04.566
Shit.

01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:15.244
- Hey, how many
did you guys get?

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.573
- She's gonna fucking die.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:44.774
- Hey.

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.042
- Hey.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.610
- What is going on?
- Look at what we got.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.412
- I crashed so hard.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.448
What?

01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:52.749
- Voila.
- Holy shit.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:53.916
- This is what we
conquered for you.

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:55.418
- Wow, I am impressed.

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:56.253
- Yes.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:57.153
- Did you do that?

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.355
Did he do that?
- Yeah.

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:00.223
Thanks to that helpful guidance.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:01.358
Katie.

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:03.260
- This guy.
- I've done it.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.863
I punched the last
hole in my man card.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:07.830
That's right.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.065
- I don't think that's a thing.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:11.768
- I will now catch
our food for us

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:14.571
for the rest of our lives.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:15.505
How are you?
- Wow.

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.707
I'm good, you caught a fish?

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:18.741
- I caught two fish.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:19.709
- Yeah? Great job.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:20.977
- Thanks to the help, yeah.

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:22.645
It was easy, I'd
never done it before.

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:24.947
- You smell like beer, get down.

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:26.182
You smell like booze.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:28.418
- Good, good,
two raisins again.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.086
- Yup.

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.220
- Alright, I'll call.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.221
No problem at all.

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:33.321
- Alright.

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:37.594
- A raisin.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.329
Another raisin bet.
- Just one.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.263
- You're really going for it.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.363
- Yeah.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.803
- Do you want me
to get some plates?

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.471
- No. I'm good.

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:49.439
- Huh?

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.907
- No, it's fine.

01:02:04.286 --> 01:02:05.655
- You want me to make a salad?

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.390
- No, no it's fine.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.894
It doesn't need a salad,
I already have vegetables.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:12.994
- Okay.

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:18.435
- Can you just not, I like...

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.174
- Hey, what's up?

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:27.610
- I just like, I can't...

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:28.710
- What?

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.381
- I like don't.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.149
- What? Hey, talk to me.
- No, no, no, I just

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:35.184
really don't want to.
- Okay.

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:38.721
- Hey, we gonna eat?

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:40.790
- Yes.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:41.624
- Yeah?

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:42.724
- Yeah.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.695
I'm just gonna
grab some kindling.

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.263
- Alright.

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:52.602
- First of all I want to
say thank you to our hosts.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.270
What a wonderful weekend.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:57.139
We've had a wonderful
exciting time

01:02:57.239 --> 01:02:59.642
and I'm so glad we came up here.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:03.980
As Kate could tell you
I've been working a lot.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.115
It's really taken
up a lot of time

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:10.319
and it's been very trying
and just being up here,

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:16.225
being with you guys, seeing
this little one again,

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:18.728
it just reminds me that this is

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:21.531
this is what's really important.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.768
Very old friends,
and very new friends,

01:03:27.169 --> 01:03:29.872
and the people that we love most

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:33.476
and the ones we hold dearest.

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.047
Anyway.

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.215
- Cheers.
- Here, here.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.750
Cheers, guys.
- Beautifully said.

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.184
- Cheers. There you go.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.394
- Baby, you're good, I got this.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.662
I'll get the rest of this.

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.130
- No, that's
alright, I can help.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:58.367
- No, no, you caught the
fish that we ate for dinner.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:03:59.836
It's fine.

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:00.770
- You sure?

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.904
- Yes.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:03.004
- Okay.

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.109
- Thank you.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.511
- Okay.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:12.549
I'm gonna have a smoke.

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:13.850
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.692
- So what'd you really
think of that fish?

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:25.495
- It was the best fish I
ever had in my whole life.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.963
- And don't flatter me.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.430
- No, me?

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:30.932
Who, me?

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:06.669
- Hey.

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:07.769
- Hey.

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.140
- How you doing?

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.676
- Good, almost done.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:20.717
- What did you and
Kate get up to today?

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:26.088
We just went down
by the lake really.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.226
- You guys go swimming?

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:33.162
- No, we just laid out.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:38.968
- Did you get up
to anything else?

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:41.470
- Not really.

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:11.167
- Is it what I think it is?

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:17.839
- Yeah.

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:26.783
I was gonna tell you.

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:29.919
I was gonna tell
you when they left.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.926
- This is a nice little bench.

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:40.595
Oh my god.

01:06:41.563 --> 01:06:43.666
This feels so good, you know?

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:44.967
- Yeah.

01:06:46.368 --> 01:06:48.638
- I've just been
so, I don't know,

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:51.307
I went a little
crazy last night.

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:52.775
- Yeah?

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.811
- I've just been
so fucking happy.

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:55.878
- Yeah?

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.179
- Just,

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.982
being out here, being away.

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:01.183
- Yeah. Good.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.687
- Just so fucking happy.

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.088
- Good.

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.124
I want you to be happy.

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.661
- I love you so much.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:14.230
- I love you so much.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:20.869
- Hey.

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:25.207
Do you want to get married?

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:27.709
- What?

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:36.418
- Do you
want to get married?

01:07:36.518 --> 01:07:37.518
- What?

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:44.225
- Hello.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.630
We got something to
share with you guys.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.598
You want to tell them?

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.502
We're gonna get married.

01:07:54.536 --> 01:07:55.905
We just decided.

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.290
- Congratulations.

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.224
- Thank you.

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:17.326
- I'm very happy for you.

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:26.267
Excuse me.

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:36.345
- You guys should probably talk.

01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:52.361
- Were you the one
to initiate it?

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:05.541
- I don't know, it
just kind of happened.

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:11.546
- Does this feel like something
that you want to do again?

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.917
Do you want like an open
relationship or something?

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.018
- No.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.656
I don't want an
open relationship.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.091
No.

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:27.196
You don't want an
open relationship.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.698
Why would you even suggest
something like that

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:31.200
that you don't even want?

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.270
- I'm not suggesting it,
I was asking the question.

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.640
Of course I don't.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.814
Babe, I think we gotta go.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.030
I mean, it's alright.

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:03.900
We'll see Em again.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:10.472
We just got to figure
this out, babe.

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:12.674
You know?

01:10:12.774 --> 01:10:16.145
I mean obviously
shit's fucked up.

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.880
- I don't, I don't,

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.418
I don't want we to go figure
out my fucked-up-ness.

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:26.688
- What are we gonna do
just talk about it here?

01:10:26.788 --> 01:10:30.927
Look, I get it, there's some
stuff that we need to work out

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:33.662
and we'll work it out, alright?

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.169
What?

01:10:43.805 --> 01:10:45.141
Why are you shaking
your head, Kate?

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.443
- Because I don't want to.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.947
Because I don't want to,

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:52.514
I don't want to get
in the car with you

01:10:52.614 --> 01:10:55.985
because if I get in
the car with you,

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:59.055
then we're gonna
drive back to Brooklyn

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:01.590
and then we're gonna
move to Seattle, and we-

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.493
and then we're gonna get
married and have kids

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:06.562
and all these things
and like, these are all

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.230
the things that you want, okay?

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.799
And here's somebody, you
know exactly what you want,

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.801
right, you know what
you want in life,

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.570
and like, I don't
know what I want.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.073
- Wait, wait, wait, you don't
know what you want, Kate?

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:18.807
What do you mean you
don't know what you want?

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.376
We've been at this
for five years.

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:23.145
- I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.180
- Don't be sorry.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.815
- I am so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.887
You and I got together and like

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:32.388
you had an idea
of what you wanted

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:35.224
and you had an idea
of who I was right?

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:37.559
- Yeah, yeah, I did have
an idea of who you were.

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:39.561
Are you saying that's
not who you are?

01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:41.397
- I'm saying, I don't
know, I'm saying

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:43.499
I'm not like the perfect
thing that you've,

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.301
like, played me out
to be all this time.

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.768
- I know you're
not perfect, Kate.

01:11:46.868 --> 01:11:48.137
- Well you treat me like I am

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:50.439
and you act like I
am and you fucking

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:53.109
put up with all of my
shit every single time.

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.443
- Yes, of course I do.

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:57.113
- If we leave here, if I
get in that car with you

01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:59.215
and we go live
our fucking lives,

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.450
I'm gonna keep
fucking up like this,

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.652
I'm gonna keep
doing fucked up shit

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:06.255
just because you let
me get away with it.

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:07.589
- Do you know how
hard it is to let you

01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:10.826
get away with your
shit when you're moody?

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.062
But that's what I do
because I love you.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.763
- That's the fucked up thing.
- I know that you are

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.798
the woman that I
want, I know that.

01:12:16.898 --> 01:12:18.267
That's what I know.

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.569
- No, I'm not, that's the
thing, is like, the version

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:23.772
that you have of me,
feels like it's missing

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.242
like five angles, there's...

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.446
- Kate, I know you're fucked up.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:32.248
- I'm not fucked up.

01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:37.453
I'm not fucked up, it's like I'm

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:39.388
trying to figure out
shit and I don't know

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:41.991
that this is the right thing.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:46.195
- Yeah, it really seemed
like you knew what you wanted

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:50.332
when I asked you to marry
me a fucking hour ago.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.570
I feel like a fucking idiot.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.445
I'm not staying here.

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:08.350
Come with me, please.

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:09.485
- No.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:12.521
- Please?

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:13.621
- No.

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:17.826
- Have I ever asked
you for anything?

01:13:19.761 --> 01:13:20.761
- Don't.

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.199
- Kate?

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:24.766
- Don't make me.

01:13:24.866 --> 01:13:27.169
- If I put up with
all this shit,

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:30.272
if I'm such a great
guy, I'm asking you,

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:35.077
Kate, please, I'm asking.

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.545
- I told you no.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:52.128
- I'm like lost in
space right now.

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:56.565
I love you, okay?

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.401
I really really do.

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.005
- Are you okay?

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:19.581
If there's anything we
can do, let us know.

01:15:35.096 --> 01:15:37.233
- Here, I poured you one.

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:45.874
Will you drink with me?

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:54.383
- Do you have any idea how
fucking selfish you are?

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:56.252
Do you have any idea?

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:51.659
- Em?

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.035
- Kate?

01:19:17.118 --> 01:19:18.118
Kate!

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.096
Nick!

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.196
Nick!

01:19:30.231 --> 01:19:32.033
I got you, I got you.

01:19:32.133 --> 01:19:33.769
Kate, please. Kate!

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:35.936
Nick! Nick!

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.709
Help me! Help me! Help me!

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:41.809
Help me!

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.550
Kate!

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:53.221
- Roll her over,
let's roll her over.

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:54.355
- Kate.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.926
Kate, Kate, Kate.

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:02.931
Come on, come on,
sweetie. Come on.

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:08.704
Kate.

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.018
- Shit.

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:49.778
Okay, it stopped bleeding.

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:33.922
- Hey, it's me.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.429
I just wanted to make sure
that you got back okay,

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:43.498
that you got home safe.

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:31.607
- Hey.

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:32.808
- Hi.

01:23:32.908 --> 01:23:34.576
- You want some coffee?

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.611
- No, I'm good, thanks.

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.790
- Are you doing okay?

01:24:32.633 --> 01:24:33.633
- No.

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:42.777
I will.

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.837
Thank you for asking.

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:14.309
- You're welcome.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:25.787
- A few showers
for the first hours

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:27.823
of the New York State Fair,
but showers

01:25:27.923 --> 01:25:29.524
should clear around
noon and give way

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:31.626
to a beautiful sunny afternoon.

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:35.897
High of 77, dropping tonight
to a dry and cool 62.

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.265
Scattered showers
tomorrow morning,

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:40.001
should clear up in time
for day two of the fair.

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:41.502
The next weather report is at noon

01:25:41.602 --> 01:25:44.639
so for now, let's get back
to our special requests.

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.207
Again, if you have
a request to make

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.309

I have Sam from
Kingston here requesting

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:55.550
a Cat Stevens classic Wild World.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.052
Excellent choice,
Sam, and we'll get

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.154
that going for you right
after this next tune,

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:00.722
one of my favorites
coming all the way

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.924
from California,
which I hope will

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:07.062
keep you smiling through
this damp but sunny Monday.
