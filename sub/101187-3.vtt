WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:01.919
Is he okay?

00:02.002 --> 00:03.629
- Oh, he's fine.

00:03.712 --> 00:05.214
When Gal Gadot was training with me,

00:05.297 --> 00:06.924
she was on fire for 12 minutes.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.759
She put herself out with a blanket.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.887
He barely lasted 12 seconds.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.180
- This is funny to you?
- Hey.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.850
A leading man must learn
not to sweat the small stuff.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.685
- What are you talking about,
the small stuff?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.062
I was on fucking fire,

00:20.145 --> 00:22.064
Coach Ron!
- Hey! Knock it off.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.899
There's a lady present,
and I want you to meet her.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.193
Agent Hart, this is Agent Jordan King.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.986
She'll be your bunkmate.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.322
- It is a pleasure to meet you.
My pleasure.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.573
Okay, you want to explain
to me why she gets

00:31.657 --> 00:32.824
this nice introduction?

00:32.908 --> 00:34.576
Why isn't she getting hit
in the head with a bat?

00:34.660 --> 00:35.744
When you gonna bop her?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.204
- Excuse me?
- Okay, you know...

00:37.287 --> 00:39.706
Just, when he does this kind of thing,

00:39.790 --> 00:41.959
I just zone him out,
when he starts to whine.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.753
Come on, I'll give you a tour.
- Okay.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.214
- Now, this used to be
a slaughterhouse years ago,

00:47.297 --> 00:48.590
up till the '70s.

00:52.177 --> 00:55.347
This brings me to rule number two:

00:55.430 --> 00:58.016
there will be no sexual intercourse
on the premises.

00:58.100 --> 01:02.980
- Uh, yeah, um, that won't be a problem.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.401
- I didn't think it would be.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.569
- I know you have to say it.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.321
It-it's fine, we're good.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.990
- All right.
So, hey, take a beat.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.325
Okay? Relax,
and we'll see you out in 20

01:15.409 --> 01:17.953
on the training ground, okay?

01:18.036 --> 01:18.996
- Thanks, Ron. You're the best.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.832
- Hey. It's a pleasure.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.963
- Dude is a fucking sociopath.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.173
- How do you mean?

01:29.256 --> 01:30.883
- How do I mean?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.593
Do you really want to know how I mean?

01:32.676 --> 01:35.053
'Cause I was here a couple days ago
when shit hit the fan.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.597
There was a guy in here accusing him

01:36.680 --> 01:38.807
of murdering some dude named Rodrigo.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.893
- Rodrigo?
- Yes, Rodrigo.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.103
Saw the whole thing.
And, when I first walked in this bitch,

01:43.187 --> 01:44.646
they hit me in the head with a bat.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.441
Not no plastic bat.
With a fucking metal bat.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.068
And today, today,
he let me catch myself on fire.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.696
- "Let me catch myself on fire."

01:52.779 --> 01:54.406
- I don't know why you got
to sound it out. Yes.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.366
Let me catch--

01:56.450 --> 01:58.118
No, I see right there, that,
'cause if you slow it down...

01:58.202 --> 01:59.703
You slow it down, it don't sound right,

01:59.786 --> 02:00.954
but you get what I'm saying.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.040
It happened.
It fucking happened.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.209
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
It's just,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.878
I don't have my phone, it's weird in here.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.505
Stuff is just starting to fuck with me.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.090
Maybe, maybe I'm going
a little stir-crazy.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.300
I don't know.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.136
Mmm-- That's shit.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.721
It's shit water.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.641
Yep. Goddamn it.

02:20.724 --> 02:24.520
- Well, you're not alone
anymore. So...

02:24.603 --> 02:26.939
- Yeah, well, maybe, but...

02:27.022 --> 02:30.150
Hey, do I know you?

02:30.234 --> 02:32.402
- Uh...

02:32.486 --> 02:35.864
- I do!

02:35.948 --> 02:38.575
Fuck! You're the girl from that sitcom,
with the robot.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.868
The robot that was a butler, right?

02:39.952 --> 02:41.119
You used to argue with the butler.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.038
"Uh-uh, get the fuck out of here, bu..."

02:43.121 --> 02:45.332
You'd do the thing.
"Butler bitch."

02:45.415 --> 02:47.835
Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.253
That's me.
- Wow.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.381
- Well, was. I just quit.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.049
Kathryn Bigelow offered me the lead

02:54.132 --> 02:56.343
in her next movie, which is huge...

02:56.426 --> 02:57.678
- Get out.
- ...since there are, like,

02:57.761 --> 03:00.472
what, three total action roles for women?

03:00.556 --> 03:04.226
- Well, it's a lot more
than that, but congrats.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.354
Are you-- I mean, want me to name 'em?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.523
Let me go down the list.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.942
You got Wonder Woman, right?
You have the Black Widow.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.320
You got, um... What's the one,
with the woman?

03:15.404 --> 03:17.114
With the, uh...

03:17.197 --> 03:18.949
She's, uh...

03:19.032 --> 03:21.159
The-- What's... That's three.

03:21.243 --> 03:25.289
- Anyway, um, it's all riding
on this action school.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.499
Just got to prove to Ron
that I've got the chops,

03:27.583 --> 03:29.126
that I'm fit enough.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.296
- You ain't got to prove that
to nobody. You are fit.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.674
When you walked in that door,
I said, "Goddamn."

03:35.757 --> 03:38.510
Not like that.

03:38.594 --> 03:39.761
I'm not saying it like that.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.638
I don't mean it that way.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.764
- I'm just here to train,

03:42.848 --> 03:43.974
not make friends.
- Yeah.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.018
- So, just to be clear.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.354
- We're-we're here for the same thing,
right? Fuck friendship.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.148
- Good.
- Yeah.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.650
- Mind if I use the bathroom?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.569
- Do what you got to do.
Bathroom right there.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.862
- Yeah.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.698
I'm gonna need you to just...

03:59.781 --> 04:02.993
- Oh. You got to shit.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.706
- Now, in this lesson,

04:07.789 --> 04:12.002
we're going to focus and explore
the action star's motivations.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.463
Agent King.
What is your motivation?

04:14.546 --> 04:16.465
- After working undercover in Paris,

04:16.548 --> 04:18.091
I go down to the basement of the Louvre,

04:18.175 --> 04:21.220
where I thwart the theft
of an ancient Egyptian artifact,

04:21.303 --> 04:23.722
when I'm accosted by a rogue agent.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.140
- Good. Agent Hart?

04:25.224 --> 04:27.267
- "Accost"?
That's a little strong, isn't it?

04:27.351 --> 04:29.144
- What the fuck?

04:29.228 --> 04:31.146
Focus. Focus.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.565
And...?

04:33.649 --> 04:35.984
- Okay, all right.
I'm-I'm an agent.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.237
- Yes.
- I'm an agent, and,

04:38.320 --> 04:40.906
um, basically, I got to, I got to go get

04:40.989 --> 04:43.116
Agent King-- I got to seduce,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.827
I got to seduce Agent King
in the basement of the Louvre.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.997
And wh-- Just a question,
is this, like, some James Bond

04:49.081 --> 04:51.124
fan fiction or something? What...?
- And action.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.217
Agent King?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.803
- Who wants to know?

05:02.886 --> 05:04.346
- Agent Hart.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.391
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.226
Not so fast.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.937
Look, you're in great danger.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.274
And the only cure for it is
to come with me to my bedroom.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.573
- Seduce her, goddamn it!

05:23.740 --> 05:25.325
Seduce her!

05:25.409 --> 05:26.785
Lure her into the car!

05:34.334 --> 05:37.129
- Get in my car.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.422
Get in my car?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.549
Fucking creep.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.135
- What'd you call...?

05:51.310 --> 05:52.978
What the fuck was that?
- Beautiful, beautiful.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.646
Keep going, keep going.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.732
- What the fuck you mean, "keep going"?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.401
What the fuck, man?
- You have a problem, Agent Hart?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.195
- Yeah, I got a problem, motherfucker.
- What is it?

06:01.278 --> 06:03.238
- She's Bruce Lee
and I'm some weird creeper.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.074
- Oh, it's too challenging for you
to seduce her. Is that it?

06:06.158 --> 06:09.536
- Uh, yes, it is,
when you got me looking...

06:12.497 --> 06:14.958
I see what you're doing.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.585
You're trying to get me all riled up.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.128
It's not gonna work.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.838
I'm not falling for your little trap,

06:19.922 --> 06:21.507
and I'm not going back over here to fight

06:21.590 --> 06:24.134
this fucking jiujitsu master
with sexy talk.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.512
- Oh. You want a change of motivation.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.972
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay. This is your new motivation.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.808
She's a Russian mole
pretending to be an FBI agent.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.269
You eliminate her with this.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.730
It's a prop knife, right?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.857
- Retractable.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.777
Now go in there and show her who's boss.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.196
- Now we're fucking talking.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.032
You say she a Russian mole, right?

06:47.115 --> 06:50.244
Okay. I don't like that.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.413
Down goes the mole. Huh?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.543
Shit. Goddamn it.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.711
Hey. I'm about to stab you in a sec, okay?

06:59.795 --> 07:01.004
Wait a minute.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.882
It's a prop knife.
Knock it off-- No.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.426
Ow! What the...
Oh, oh, you got to sell it,

07:06.510 --> 07:07.553
make it look real.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.305
Fuck! Ow!

07:13.016 --> 07:15.519
- What the fuck?!

07:15.602 --> 07:16.937
- Real blood.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.357
- Oh, my God.
- What have you done to her?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.818
What have you done to her?

07:22.901 --> 07:24.236
- I'm so sorry. I thought,

07:24.319 --> 07:25.696
I thought you said it was a retractable.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.239
- Oh, God.
- I said it was "practical."

07:27.322 --> 07:29.575
It's a practical knife!
It's a real knife!

07:29.658 --> 07:31.660
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God, she's passing out.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.704
- Oh, shit.
- I'm gonna have to stitch her up.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.122
- I've got a medical kit in my office.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.582
- All right, I'll go grab it.
- No.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.000
-Ow, ow, ow.
-Go to your room!

07:38.083 --> 07:39.168
You're grounded!

07:39.251 --> 07:40.377
- No. What are you talking about?
I'll go grab it.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.337
- No!

07:42.421 --> 07:45.174
My office is off-limits to students.

07:51.013 --> 07:54.641
I said my office is off-limits.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.519
If you disobey me again,

07:57.603 --> 07:59.521
the next time I throw that knife,

07:59.605 --> 08:01.064
it'll be through your fucking skull.
