I THINK ANYONE WHO SMOKES
IS A DISGUSTING PIG.

19:13.567 --> 19:16.200
I'M TRYING TO QUIT.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.300
WELL, IT'S NOT
THAT EASY, MINKUS.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.300
THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF PRESSURE.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.000
I MEAN,
WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.400
COULD YOU USE SOMEBODY ELSE
AS AN EXAMPLE, PLEASE?

19:25.600 --> 19:26.667
SURE.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.100
WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.734
WHAT ABOUT IT?
WHAT ABOUT DRUGS?

19:29.734 --> 19:31.200
HEY, CALM DOWN, ERIC.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.934
WE'RE NOT
INTO THAT STUFF.

19:32.934 --> 19:35.400
ALL WE LIKE IS BASEBALL
AND COMIC BOOKS.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.967
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
YOU LIKE NOW.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.100
BUT THAT'S GOING
TO CHANGE,

19:38.100 --> 19:39.900
JUST LIKE YOU'RE
CHANGING SCHOOLS.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.300
JUST LIKE YOU'RE GOING
TO START FEELING

19:41.300 --> 19:42.500
A LOT OF NEW
STUFF INSIDE YOU

19:42.500 --> 19:44.100
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
GONNA UNDERSTAND.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

19:46.100 --> 19:48.100
BECAUSE YOU'RE
GROWING UP.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.934
SOME OF YOU
HAVE ALREADY STARTED.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.567
Minkus: SHE LOVES ME...

20:00.200 --> 20:01.800
SHE LOVES ME NOT.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.300
SHE LOVES ME...

20:04.300 --> 20:06.467
SHE LOVES ME NOT.

20:06.467 --> 20:08.767
THIS IS ABSURD.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.367
THIS ISN'T RATIONAL
OR LOGICAL AT ALL.

20:14.867 --> 20:16.700
SHE LOVES ME...

20:16.700 --> 20:18.700
SHE LOVES ME NOT.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.200
LOOK AT HIM.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.500
THE LOVE BOMB HAS
BLOWN HIS HEAD OFF.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.600
THIS IS BIG.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.000
THIS LOVE THING COULD
KILL US IF WE LET IT.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.300
YOU AND I HAVE TO MAKE
A DEAL RIGHT NOW.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.233
LET EVERYONE ELSE
GO NUTS.

20:31.233 --> 20:33.033
WE STAY THE SAME.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.133
FOREVER.

20:34.133 --> 20:37.200
EXCUSE ME.
I'M NEW HERE.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.734
HOW DO I GET TO
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE?

20:41.667 --> 20:42.834
WE HAVE A DEAL.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.233
WE HAVE A DEAL.

20:47.233 --> 20:48.934
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE?

20:48.934 --> 20:50.867
I'VE BEEN THERE
A MILLION TIMES.

20:50.867 --> 20:53.500
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS.
I'LL TAKE YOU.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.800
WE HAVE A DEAL!
WE HAVE A DEAL!

21:01.700 --> 21:03.734
[READING FRENCH]

21:05.934 --> 21:07.033
MONSIEUR MINKUS,

21:07.033 --> 21:09.033
IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING,

21:09.033 --> 21:12.000
WE WOULDN'T NEED YOUR HELP
FOR THE FRENCH TEST.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.300
<i>PARDONNEZ MOI. </i>
I WILL SPEAK ENGLISH.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.000
YOU WILL PLEASE
ANSWER IN FRENCH.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.033
THE CHICKEN.

21:17.033 --> 21:18.967
LE POOL-LET.

21:18.967 --> 21:20.834
<i>LE POULET. </i>

21:20.834 --> 21:21.600
THE FROG.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.367
LA GREEN OIL.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.133
<i>LA GRENOUILLE. </i>

21:26.133 --> 21:28.934
MINKUS, COME ON.
THERE'S 10 LETTERS HERE,

21:28.934 --> 21:31.033
AND YOU'RE ONLY USING
5 OF THEM.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.767
<i>AU CONTRAIRE. </i>

21:32.767 --> 21:34.233
THE FINAL "E"
IS SILENT.

21:34.233 --> 21:37.367
THE DOUBLE "L" IS
LIKE THE SPANISH "YE".

21:37.367 --> 21:39.834
AND THE DIPHTHONG
CREATES A "W" SOUND.

21:39.834 --> 21:40.967
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.000
NO, MINKUS,
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SIMPLE?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.133
FROG.

21:44.133 --> 21:47.300
YEAH, THE F-R-O IS
PRONOUNCED "FRA".

21:47.300 --> 21:50.667
AND THE "G" IS
LIKE THE ENGLISH "GA".

21:50.667 --> 21:52.900
WHY CAN'T THESE FRENCH GUYS

21:52.900 --> 21:55.300
JUST SPEAK ENGLISH
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE?

21:55.300 --> 21:58.100
WHO CARES
HOW THE FRENCH TALK?

21:58.100 --> 21:59.600
I LIKE HOW THEY KISS.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.567
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:00.567 --> 22:02.300
THEY KISS
DIFFERENTLY, TOO?

22:02.300 --> 22:03.800
LET ME PUT IT
THIS WAY, BOYS.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.667
THE TONGUE
IS NOT SILENT.

22:06.667 --> 22:09.000
EEYEUW!
EEYEUW!
EEYEUW!
