01:32.958 --> 01:35.375
Forget your life out there.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Forget who you are

01:38.250 --> 01:40.916
or what you'll be again tomorrow.

01:41.250 --> 01:45.250
And be merry here
at the Lost Paradise.

01:45.750 --> 01:50.416
The place for those who know how to love.

03:50.083 --> 03:56.416
No, I can't believe
What happened

03:56.958 --> 03:59.916
It was just a dream of mine

04:00.708 --> 04:03.833
Nothing is really over

04:05.041 --> 04:10.791
No, it is not possible
I can't live without you

04:11.833 --> 04:15.083
Come back and see

04:15.625 --> 04:18.791
All in me has changed

04:18.916 --> 04:19.791
LOST PARADISE

04:19.916 --> 04:24.833
I can no longer live inside myself

04:25.750 --> 04:29.041
And... And living like that

04:29.416 --> 04:33.875
It's almost like dying

04:34.458 --> 04:40.500
Come to me and tell me, smiling
That you were just kidding

04:40.625 --> 04:44.166
And that it is still mine

04:44.291 --> 04:48.041
Just mine your love

04:55.666 --> 04:57.375
Stop, stop, stop!

05:00.125 --> 05:01.541
Turn off the engine.

05:03.458 --> 05:04.666
Remove your helmet.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.958
Are you in a hurry, gentleman?

05:09.041 --> 05:10.083
No, not really.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.583
Do you like music?

05:12.583 --> 05:14.541
Come see me in my show.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.000
You are my guest.

05:18.583 --> 05:19.958
LOST PARADISE
LIVE MUSIC

05:22.416 --> 05:24.166
- Go. Go on.
- Thanks.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.333
Slow down, okay?

05:30.708 --> 05:36.208
Come to me and tell me, smiling
That you were just kidding

05:36.750 --> 05:42.541
And that it is still mine
Just mine

05:43.166 --> 05:49.708
Your love

05:51.000 --> 05:56.791
Oh, love

07:30.791 --> 07:32.125
Imã! Imã! Pepe!

07:33.666 --> 07:34.875
Police!

07:34.958 --> 07:37.625
Police! Stop! Stop!

07:38.541 --> 07:39.750
Stop!

07:50.833 --> 07:52.083
Calm down.
It's okay.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.208
It's okay.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.916
A hero. Who are you?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.250
Do you live around here?

08:00.833 --> 08:03.166
Did you see my shoe heel?

08:09.125 --> 08:10.666
Here it is.

08:12.416 --> 08:14.708
This feels like a movie.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.291
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.083
Don't worry.

08:21.416 --> 08:23.375
- I'm a happy person.
- Imã!

08:23.458 --> 08:24.875
Listen to that!

08:25.208 --> 08:26.916
He loves me!

08:34.875 --> 08:36.082
Imã.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.958
LOST PARADISE

09:15.041 --> 09:17.666
I'm gonna climb your entire body

09:17.791 --> 09:21.666
How someone climbs the tallest mountain

09:21.750 --> 09:25.416
And then I'll really scream it out loud

09:25.833 --> 09:29.166
The pleasure of this great feat

09:29.583 --> 09:33.416
Sometimes your body shivers

09:33.875 --> 09:37.833
When I climb just a little higher

09:37.958 --> 09:41.250
But none of that will really stop me

09:41.375 --> 09:45.000
Or make me backtrack

09:45.083 --> 09:48.833
I feel that
I'm already reaching the summit

09:49.166 --> 09:53.041
On this incredible mountain of love

09:53.208 --> 09:57.166
That was never ascended before

09:57.333 --> 10:01.291
That's why I feel like a winner

10:01.541 --> 10:04.875
And I continue the long climb

10:05.333 --> 10:09.166
Seeking pleasure in other arms

10:09.250 --> 10:12.458
And I feel that I'll soon be ready

10:12.541 --> 10:17.750
To finally possess you

10:18.583 --> 10:20.375
Thank you, everyone.

10:20.458 --> 10:24.625
Now Teylor with "Sweet Sin."

10:31.500 --> 10:33.958
You were the truth

10:34.083 --> 10:36.083
And the happiness

10:36.333 --> 10:37.916
That I wanted

10:41.583 --> 10:45.250
You were much more
You were the peace

10:45.375 --> 10:47.958
That I did not know

10:50.458 --> 10:52.708
My sweet sin

10:52.833 --> 10:54.875
My daydream

10:54.958 --> 10:56.166
My delight

11:00.375 --> 11:02.291
You were my craziness

11:02.375 --> 11:06.291
My tenderness
My fantasy

11:06.916 --> 11:08.416
You seem surprised.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.958
No, just curious.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.166
That's my first time here.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.041
Welcome to Paradise.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.458
I haven't introduced myself. José.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.541
Odair.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.833
Thank you so much for helping Imã.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.458
That was my duty.

11:25.541 --> 11:27.125
- I am--
- An angel.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.083
I'm a police officer.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.583
A guardian angel, then.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.166
No.

11:32.666 --> 11:36.041
- I'm no angel.
- Why did you choose to be a policeman?

11:36.625 --> 11:39.208
- It was either that or a thug.
- Or a priest.

11:41.458 --> 11:44.416
- Are you religious?
- Not even facing death.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.041
Odair?

11:49.166 --> 11:52.666
Would you like to work for me?
A freelance job at night.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.625
What kind of work would that be?

11:56.166 --> 11:58.125
Protect Imã.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.583
She's like a son to me.

12:02.458 --> 12:03.875
And I let myself go

12:03.958 --> 12:07.666
For your sweet kiss
For its flavor

12:07.791 --> 12:10.958
By your crazy way
Of provoking me

12:11.041 --> 12:14.000
And making love to me

12:22.541 --> 12:23.375
Hey!

12:26.375 --> 12:27.375
I'm glad you came.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.416
Did you like my song?

12:31.250 --> 12:34.083
Yeah, I like Reginaldo Rossi.

12:37.125 --> 12:38.291
You even know the song.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.541
From my mom.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.291
- She was a singer.
- Was?

12:43.708 --> 12:44.708
Why? Did she die?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.208
No.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.250
- She became deaf.
- Damn.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.708
Come with me, Odair.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.208
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.125
Imã...

13:00.541 --> 13:04.375
we need the description of the first guy
who assaulted you.

13:05.958 --> 13:08.791
I saw you were on the floor
when the motorbike arrived.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.333
It was all so fast.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.916
Did he say anything before he hit you?

13:14.458 --> 13:15.500
Nothing.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.750
- No name calling?
- No.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.375
Was he bigger than you?

13:21.458 --> 13:23.291
- Shorter.
- Skin color?

13:24.250 --> 13:25.458
Fair.

13:25.958 --> 13:27.041
Hair color?

13:29.958 --> 13:31.000
Bald.

13:35.250 --> 13:36.458
Are you sure?

13:37.416 --> 13:39.708
- Absolutely sure, ma'am?
- Not ma'am.

13:40.625 --> 13:41.541
Man.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.250
It may not look like,
but I love being a man.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.791
Can I help you with anything?

15:13.625 --> 15:16.166
Sorry to invade like this.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.041
I was hired as Imã's bodyguard.

15:21.666 --> 15:23.500
It was my father who hired you.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.541
- José is your father?
- Yes. And Imã's grandfather.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.375
My nephew.

15:29.458 --> 15:30.291
Oh!

15:32.583 --> 15:34.083
Nice meeting you. Ângelo.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.541
- Odair.
- Odair?

15:36.625 --> 15:37.458
Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.291
Odair.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.166
Nice.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.416
Nice meeting you.

15:48.958 --> 15:51.000
- May I check your bathroom?
- Of course.

15:51.958 --> 15:53.166
Excuse me.

16:52.708 --> 16:55.583
All this time
That I have not seen you

16:55.666 --> 16:58.750
With all this longing
That I felt about you

16:58.833 --> 17:03.208
You do not see, do not see, do not see

17:05.040 --> 17:08.040
That I have a lot of love
Here inside my chest

17:08.165 --> 17:11.125
To deliver to you
But I feel so shy

17:11.250 --> 17:14.958
You do not see, do not see, do not see

17:15.040 --> 17:17.875
- Three o'clock in the morning!
- Turn that sound down!

17:17.958 --> 17:21.790
- Turn it down, for Christ's sake!
- Are you nuts?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.290
- What the hell, dude?
- Hey!

17:23.415 --> 17:25.583
- It's no use, she can't hear.
- Oh, really?

17:25.750 --> 17:28.415
- And she's playing that song for us?
- He's a cop.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.833
- He does whatever he wants here!
- Ridiculous! It's every night, now?

17:33.500 --> 17:37.125
To say, say, say

17:38.458 --> 17:43.375
I love you, I want you
I cannot live alone anymore

17:44.875 --> 17:50.083
It's no use trying to forget you
Meeting someone else

17:51.000 --> 17:56.291
I'll go and I'll sweep you forever
One way or another

17:57.083 --> 18:02.333
And never again I'll let you go
Away from me

18:17.916 --> 18:21.000
You are so late.

18:24.875 --> 18:28.291
A singer was assaulted.

18:28.375 --> 18:32.291
His grandfather hired me

18:32.416 --> 18:36.791
to be his grandson's bodyguard.

18:37.375 --> 18:40.125
What type of music?

18:41.250 --> 18:47.041
Reginaldo Rossi.

18:52.375 --> 18:59.375
Márcio Greyck.

19:02.500 --> 19:06.291
I knew you were gonna love it.

19:08.625 --> 19:12.666
Is there any female singer in the family?

19:13.458 --> 19:16.625
No woman until now.

19:28.375 --> 19:33.375
Today someone started spinning

19:33.458 --> 19:34.750
AYMORE
COOKIES

19:35.125 --> 19:39.666
An album by Gardel
In the apartment next to mine

19:39.958 --> 19:43.375
How sad was that

19:44.416 --> 19:49.375
It was a beautiful past

19:51.375 --> 19:55.416
My youth coming off the wall
To let me know

19:55.708 --> 19:59.416
That I should feel gloomy

20:01.083 --> 20:06.583
My life is really peaceful these days

20:07.708 --> 20:09.875
With a tango within my soul

20:09.958 --> 20:14.958
An old story of a love
That in time was forgotten

20:15.083 --> 20:18.708
Waiter, put some beer
On the table

20:19.041 --> 20:22.958
Bandoneon play again
About Teresa

20:23.208 --> 20:26.583
That tonight she will be mine
And she's going to dance

20:27.208 --> 20:29.083
So I can dream

20:29.666 --> 20:31.583
That's so beautiful, uncle!

20:31.708 --> 20:34.833
I can already imagine
you divinely singing this song.

20:35.416 --> 20:38.583
But this song was written for a lady,
uncle. It's for Teresa.

20:38.708 --> 20:41.291
And can't you imagine yourself loving
a woman?

20:41.833 --> 20:43.083
Hardly!

20:43.208 --> 20:46.541
- Angela Maria was able.
- Ouch...

20:46.708 --> 20:49.708
What is it? Does it hurt?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.125
Only when I laugh, uncle.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.041
So, keep smiling even if it hurts.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.375
Your mom says your strength
comes from there.

20:55.458 --> 20:58.083
Never let anyone kill that smile.

20:58.208 --> 21:01.583
- I miss her so much.
- Yeah, we all do.

21:01.958 --> 21:05.208
I count the days for her to be back.
And another thing...

21:06.916 --> 21:09.458
People don't hate you for what you are,

21:11.250 --> 21:13.541
but for what they cannot be.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.500
- Don't forget that.
- I don't, uncle.

21:18.166 --> 21:21.666
Now, if all the papers showed
pictures and everything--

21:21.750 --> 21:25.583
If it read: "Two homophobic men arrested
for assaulting transvestite singer."

21:25.666 --> 21:29.791
- That I would love to see. That I would!
- Forget that, Imã. Come here.

21:29.875 --> 21:34.041
Hold your uncle tight and let's dance.
Squeeze!

21:35.500 --> 21:39.000
It seems to tell me

21:39.666 --> 21:42.833
That the night got old

21:43.708 --> 21:47.458
And that's time to remember

21:47.541 --> 21:49.916
Now, only the girl goes. Turn around.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.416
And to weep

21:55.833 --> 21:56.875
Next.

22:01.958 --> 22:04.583
I want to schedule an abortion.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.208
A procedure.

22:06.541 --> 22:07.416
That's it.

22:08.291 --> 22:09.958
Three thousand reais in cash,

22:10.041 --> 22:12.500
and you should be accompanied
by someone older than 18.

22:12.583 --> 22:13.500
Eighteen?

22:13.583 --> 22:18.750
I can schedule for tomorrow or--
Let me see here--

22:20.875 --> 22:23.125
For ten days from today.
When would you like?

22:25.083 --> 22:26.958
- In ten days.
- Okay.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.041
How long will you be pregnant then?

22:31.208 --> 22:32.791
Two and a half months.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.416
Are you sure?

22:38.166 --> 22:39.375
About the procedure?

22:39.916 --> 22:42.458
No, the time of the pregnancy.

22:43.958 --> 22:46.166
Yes. Yes, I am.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.083
Your name?

22:49.583 --> 22:51.208
Celeste da Silva.

22:52.958 --> 22:56.000
Celeste da Silva.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.833
Age?

22:58.083 --> 22:59.208
Thirty years old.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.833
Aunt, it's me, Celeste.

23:30.958 --> 23:32.583
Celeste!

23:33.208 --> 23:35.541
My goodness!
You are so beautiful!

23:38.791 --> 23:40.166
You look like your dad.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.791
Was it Imã who brought you here?

23:43.875 --> 23:46.875
No, Imã woke up
with a lot pain in the jaw.

23:48.958 --> 23:52.333
- Maybe her wisdom teeth, right?
- Yeah.

23:52.541 --> 23:54.750
Yes. It is probably the wisdom teeth.

23:57.208 --> 23:58.250
And you?

23:58.708 --> 24:01.000
Tell me, what do you do?

24:01.083 --> 24:03.750
Events.
Rich people's stuff, you know?

24:03.833 --> 24:08.083
They hire me to prettify the parties
they run for the clients.

24:10.541 --> 24:12.125
Prettify you mean--

24:13.583 --> 24:15.291
You are a call-girl?

24:16.333 --> 24:17.958
No, aunt!

24:18.583 --> 24:21.500
It may seem odd,
but I'm paid just to smile at them.

24:21.583 --> 24:24.541
- Just a pretty face there.
- That's a good job.

24:24.625 --> 24:25.458
Yeah.

24:25.541 --> 24:27.166
I can't complain.

24:28.875 --> 24:32.208
But it is hard to smile
when I really want to cry.

24:34.458 --> 24:35.875
Who hurt you, Celeste?

24:36.916 --> 24:39.583
My boyfriend. My ex, he--

24:39.666 --> 24:40.833
Cheated on you?

24:42.375 --> 24:43.208
A scumbag.

24:44.208 --> 24:48.916
Aunt, is it true that you were pregnant
when all that happened?

24:50.333 --> 24:51.375
Yes.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.208
I was seven months pregnant with Imã.

24:54.708 --> 24:56.833
Weren't you afraid of risking his life?

24:57.375 --> 25:00.583
I risked my own life to save his.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.458
To protect him against his dad.

25:02.583 --> 25:06.208
Imã was born in prison, but he was born.
It was mother's instinct.

25:06.375 --> 25:09.833
I wouldn't waste my life
here in this prison for any man.

25:09.916 --> 25:11.458
You hear me?

25:22.708 --> 25:25.208
Dear audience, good evening.

25:26.791 --> 25:30.416
Somebody said
that when an artist feels the need

25:30.541 --> 25:32.958
to explain their art...

25:35.833 --> 25:39.750
Somebody said
that when an artist feels the need

25:39.833 --> 25:43.458
to explain their art to the spectators

25:43.791 --> 25:45.250
one of them is an ass.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.458
I've never been so sure of myself

25:50.583 --> 25:54.916
When I chose him
To be the love of my life

25:55.000 --> 25:59.208
It is not possible that
My heart can be beguiled

25:59.916 --> 26:04.291
What it feels
It's positively love

26:04.833 --> 26:09.333
This is jealousy
Fruit from some misfortune

26:09.416 --> 26:13.291
From unfortunate ones
Whom love did not know

26:13.416 --> 26:15.125
I'm pregnant.

26:15.208 --> 26:17.250
If God wanted this man--

26:18.791 --> 26:22.333
He would not have indicated me
As a gift of his own

26:22.458 --> 26:24.708
I need money for an abortion.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.458
A passion can be seen
By the eyes

26:28.000 --> 26:29.458
You'd be a beautiful mom.

26:29.541 --> 26:32.833
Of that someone
That brings an inner glow

26:33.208 --> 26:36.875
Our love is mutual

26:37.000 --> 26:38.458
I don't want to be a single mom.

26:38.583 --> 26:42.625
We are deaf
To the false snitch

26:42.708 --> 26:46.208
Our life is so complete
So harmonious

26:46.333 --> 26:48.000
I need to go with someone over 18.

26:48.125 --> 26:51.208
That does not allow
Our love to die

26:51.500 --> 26:54.083
If I listened
To all those evil rumors

26:54.208 --> 26:55.208
Can you go with me?

26:56.250 --> 26:59.791
My life instead of whole
Would be empty and without you

26:59.916 --> 27:01.041
I can be the dad.

27:01.625 --> 27:05.291
If I listened
To those evil rumors

27:05.375 --> 27:07.791
Granddad was our mom.
Together we can raise this kid.

27:07.875 --> 27:11.333
My life instead of whole
Would be empty and without you

27:23.833 --> 27:25.083
Bravo!

27:30.166 --> 27:31.041
Imã.

27:33.333 --> 27:35.833
- Whose song was that?
- From Raul Seixas.

27:37.208 --> 27:39.083
I didn't know. It is different.

27:40.041 --> 27:41.083
Imã...

27:42.250 --> 27:44.208
why were you using sign language?

27:44.291 --> 27:47.666
- How did you learn that?
- With Xuxa, don't you remember?

27:47.750 --> 27:53.041
A for all, B for baby
C for cuddle

27:53.375 --> 27:56.208
- That's funny.
- Here we listen to everything

27:56.291 --> 27:58.958
and that became our secret language.
Mine and Kinswoman's.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.750
- Kinswoman?
- Yeah. Celeste is my cousin,

28:02.833 --> 28:04.375
daughter of uncle Ângelo.

28:05.541 --> 28:08.458
- Ângelo's?
- Why the surprise?

28:09.208 --> 28:10.750
No, nothing.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.500
It's...

28:13.291 --> 28:16.500
just that your cousin should be careful

28:16.583 --> 28:18.708
with those underground clinics.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.458
- It is dangerous.
- Did you watch Xuxa too?

28:21.541 --> 28:22.375
No!

28:22.458 --> 28:24.583
I didn't watch Xuxa.

28:25.708 --> 28:28.125
It's my mom, she cannot hear.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.041
That's why you are like that, then.
Watchful.

28:34.291 --> 28:36.875
Yes, for that too. Imã...

28:38.583 --> 28:43.708
If you need anything, any help,
just let me know.

28:44.666 --> 28:48.458
- You swear?
- I don't know how to swear, Imã.

28:49.833 --> 28:50.875
Excuse me.

28:51.916 --> 28:52.958
Odair?

28:53.916 --> 28:56.833
Send your mom a kiss.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.375
Thank you.

29:09.708 --> 29:13.708
Dreaming of you

29:14.041 --> 29:17.166
Throughout my life

29:18.208 --> 29:22.541
Dreaming of you
My love

29:22.708 --> 29:26.208
To be your darling

29:26.916 --> 29:28.583
To live

29:28.708 --> 29:34.000
Only thinking of you

29:35.208 --> 29:39.708
Live to love you
Be only yours

29:39.833 --> 29:44.041
Eternally

29:44.125 --> 29:47.958
This is

29:48.083 --> 29:52.041
My greatest desire

29:53.083 --> 29:56.958
Take your hands
Shut your voice

29:57.083 --> 30:00.541
In a long kiss

30:01.041 --> 30:03.916
Your daughter is a princess!
I have a crush on her.

30:04.041 --> 30:07.041
With all due respect, of course.
She's a serious girl.

30:07.458 --> 30:12.000
We have to be serious.
But she's something. She's something.

30:12.583 --> 30:15.000
You know you have my blessings, right?

30:15.125 --> 30:16.416
You're my bro.

30:18.041 --> 30:19.083
But then again...

30:20.333 --> 30:21.583
It's just a crush.

30:21.708 --> 30:24.583
Nothing is gonna happen,
she doesn't want me.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.541
Yeah, her heart belongs
to somebody else already.

30:28.958 --> 30:30.958
Soft heart like her dad's.

30:43.208 --> 30:44.375
What is it?

30:44.916 --> 30:47.916
That story about Xuxa is hysterical.

30:49.541 --> 30:50.791
I thought so too.

30:52.833 --> 30:57.083
How about the cross-dresser singer?
Did he get better?

30:58.125 --> 31:01.750
Yes, he's singing again.

31:02.291 --> 31:04.625
And sang what?

31:07.041 --> 31:11.541
"I Was Never More Sure of Myself."

31:12.791 --> 31:14.208
Do you know it?

31:15.458 --> 31:18.791
Of course. Núbia recorded it.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.416
It became an inspiration to me.

31:25.041 --> 31:28.500
She also recorded "Shelter and Food".

31:30.666 --> 31:36.250
It became like an anthem
for all cheated women.

31:39.666 --> 31:46.666
The cousin girl should sing that song.

31:48.875 --> 31:50.625
Cool. I'll suggest that.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.333
I'm glad you're here.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.208
But that sad face is not good.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.416
The thought of becoming a mom...

32:02.500 --> 32:05.000
- It is scary indeed.
- It is?

32:05.583 --> 32:06.916
It sure is.

32:07.208 --> 32:10.666
It is a rad experience.
Maybe the most radical experience of all.

32:10.750 --> 32:13.625
But later you'll be fine, really fine.

32:13.875 --> 32:16.041
Self-assured, empowered.

32:16.375 --> 32:17.958
It is the hormones, right?

32:18.041 --> 32:22.041
Right. Did you tell your dad
or your grandfather?

32:22.166 --> 32:23.708
No, just Imã knows.

32:24.791 --> 32:25.958
Aunt, how...

32:26.041 --> 32:28.416
How old were you when grandma died?

32:31.500 --> 32:34.666
It is hard to tell when she died.

32:35.666 --> 32:37.416
We never knew for sure.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.916
She was arrested and then disappeared.

32:42.416 --> 32:45.875
- Just like mine.
- No way, Celeste! That's bullshit!

32:46.041 --> 32:48.083
The dictatorship made my mother vanish.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.166
I'm sorry, but I don't know what is worse!

32:50.291 --> 32:54.166
- At least you know the reason.
- Don't judge your mom, Celeste.

32:55.208 --> 32:59.500
Each person has their story, their pain.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.833
Your granddad, for instance.

33:02.916 --> 33:06.458
Left an academic career
to isolate himself in that bar.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.166
Never got over the loss
of the love of his life.

33:10.708 --> 33:14.375
Something happened to your mom.
I'm positive.

33:15.375 --> 33:16.583
Do you remember her?

33:19.458 --> 33:21.875
She was like an incandescent sun.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.750
Pure passion, pure life.

33:26.666 --> 33:29.916
She could only live intensely.

33:34.125 --> 33:37.250
- Celeste? Are you okay?
- I'm just... I'm just a little dizzy.

33:37.375 --> 33:38.458
Calm down and breath.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.375
No, Celeste!

33:40.916 --> 33:43.500
Guard! Somebody help!

33:55.041 --> 33:57.208
All my stuff

33:57.291 --> 34:00.541
Became sad all of a sudden

34:00.916 --> 34:04.125
They understood
That there is nothing

34:04.250 --> 34:07.416
Nothing else between the two of us

34:08.666 --> 34:13.875
My guitar fell off the top
Of that old closet

34:14.625 --> 34:16.916
Odair, you cuckold!

34:17.791 --> 34:20.541
Hushing for good my own voice

34:21.416 --> 34:23.291
Son of a bitch.

34:25.250 --> 34:30.791
My overcoat
Got so used to you

34:30.916 --> 34:34.041
It missed you so much

34:34.291 --> 34:37.375
That it faded from all the sadness

34:42.125 --> 34:47.500
If I knew
That one day I would lose you

34:47.875 --> 34:50.916
I would not have let all my things

34:51.291 --> 34:54.458
Get accustomed to you

34:54.541 --> 34:57.666
I would not have let all my things

34:57.791 --> 35:01.125
Get accustomed to you

35:13.500 --> 35:16.750
Even my car
Has lost all its speed

35:16.833 --> 35:18.375
You took so long today.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.166
But I was dying to see you.

35:28.666 --> 35:30.541
I have something to tell you.

35:34.583 --> 35:37.291
But I don't know how you'll react--

35:47.500 --> 35:49.166
You are going to be a grandmother!

35:53.000 --> 35:55.041
Our daughter is pregnant!

36:20.083 --> 36:21.416
Pardon me, Mr. Ângelo.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.708
They will announce you on stage
in a few minutes.

36:24.041 --> 36:24.958
All right.

36:38.541 --> 36:40.166
Sorry, but...

36:40.791 --> 36:44.375
The other day I saw it on your mirror.

36:46.416 --> 36:48.500
It's a beautiful girl
the one on that picture.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.333
Thank you.

36:53.166 --> 36:54.541
Is she your girlfriend?

36:58.375 --> 37:00.000
She's the woman of my life.

37:04.791 --> 37:06.041
I can understand.

37:08.916 --> 37:09.958
I gotta go.

37:20.250 --> 37:22.291
Nothing

37:23.416 --> 37:25.333
Nothing else matters now

37:27.541 --> 37:29.666
You went away

37:31.416 --> 37:33.666
And I was left alone

37:36.208 --> 37:37.958
I move on

37:39.625 --> 37:41.375
Not knowing my direction

37:43.666 --> 37:46.541
I don't get used to

37:47.708 --> 37:51.166
Being without you

37:52.291 --> 37:55.875
What's the use of having
Everything in life

37:56.375 --> 37:59.041
What's the use of the beauty of a flower

38:00.291 --> 38:02.958
If I don't have your affection anymore

38:03.041 --> 38:04.541
MY BAD.
PEDRO 98299-9897

38:04.625 --> 38:07.208
If I do not feel your warmth anymore

38:10.791 --> 38:12.291
Today

38:12.416 --> 38:14.083
"YOUR BAD" WAS GOOD.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.375
I'm so free

38:19.166 --> 38:20.500
I can

38:21.875 --> 38:24.000
Love whoever I want

38:26.791 --> 38:27.833
However

38:30.041 --> 38:32.666
Nothing interests me

38:34.291 --> 38:37.041
Even if you offer

38:38.000 --> 38:42.291
The world at my feet

38:42.375 --> 38:46.000
What's the use of having
Everything in life

38:46.541 --> 38:49.708
What's the use of the beauty of a flower

38:50.708 --> 38:53.041
If I do not have your affection anymore

38:53.125 --> 38:55.541
If you say no, I'll kill you.

39:02.416 --> 39:05.541
I shouldn't have come.
I'm gonna kick that guy's ass.

39:05.750 --> 39:08.375
Forget the leading man
and focus on the baby.

39:09.166 --> 39:11.541
- What? Baby?
- Yeah.

39:11.666 --> 39:15.291
Kinswoman is pregnant.
She's hurt and confused.

39:15.416 --> 39:19.375
So, you'll have to be quick, prince,
if you want to give birth.

39:21.666 --> 39:23.458
- Hey!
- What the hell, bro?

39:23.541 --> 39:25.958
- Get out, dude!
- You should get out, Joca!

39:26.041 --> 39:29.000
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm the father of her baby!

39:29.083 --> 39:31.833
- Tell me that is not true.
- He's crazy, Teylor.

39:31.916 --> 39:33.958
Celeste, you know I can't live
without you.

39:34.041 --> 39:36.791
- Tell me the truth, no matter what!
- Grant his wish.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.291
I'll say a thousand times.
This son is yours, my love.

39:40.375 --> 39:44.041
- Gross! I don't believe it!
- What? Do you want a statement?

39:45.000 --> 39:48.916
This is a peaceful place!
Hey, they are fighting here!

39:49.791 --> 39:52.916
Joca! Stop that! What are you doing?

39:55.250 --> 39:56.875
Stop that, Joca!

39:56.958 --> 40:00.375
- What is this? What is this, Teylor?
- Sorry, peeps.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.041
It was just a family quarrel.
It's all good.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.166
My daughter, she's pregnant.

40:40.416 --> 40:42.791
- Hey, show me your paid tab.
- I need a smoke.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.291
- There's a place in there.
- Can't I go out?

40:45.375 --> 40:47.958
- No.
- He's with me, Pepe.

40:48.041 --> 40:50.916
- He won't leave without paying.
- Thanks.

40:53.916 --> 40:55.916
- Did you need all that?
- Get in there!

40:56.000 --> 40:57.208
Keep your cool, son.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.333
You stay there.

41:02.541 --> 41:03.958
Sit down, son.

41:04.041 --> 41:07.708
I'm sorry, Mr. José,
but she was all over the guy--

41:07.791 --> 41:09.708
Sit down, I wanna talk to you!

41:09.791 --> 41:11.166
Pregnant from another guy.

41:11.291 --> 41:13.750
Now you'll have to prove
that you love my daughter!

41:13.833 --> 41:16.166
- But I do!
- Prove it!

41:16.250 --> 41:18.375
What do you mean, was I too subtle?

41:18.458 --> 41:19.791
- Is that it?
- Look,

41:20.166 --> 41:24.416
what I am saying is that you'll have
to convince her of your feelings.

41:27.583 --> 41:30.375
In case you wanna save the family
that is about to be born.

41:32.166 --> 41:33.958
- Is it because of my cheating?
- Boy...

41:34.333 --> 41:35.375
Is that it?

41:35.458 --> 41:36.875
Because you left her, Joca.

41:37.416 --> 41:40.750
You have to understand that
that's my granddaughter's story.

41:41.125 --> 41:42.166
Are you okay?

41:44.250 --> 41:45.916
Better, impossible.

41:47.125 --> 41:48.833
That's good.

41:50.166 --> 41:51.375
E Teylor?

41:51.458 --> 41:53.875
Glad with his triumphal performance.

41:56.208 --> 41:58.250
When are you bringing
your mom?

42:00.500 --> 42:03.666
I'm getting her ready for that.

42:04.916 --> 42:05.875
What do you mean?

42:07.416 --> 42:11.541
My mom hasn't come out of the house
for years, Celeste.

42:11.625 --> 42:13.208
Really? Why?

42:13.291 --> 42:18.250
Fear. Fear paralyzed her life
after she...

42:19.375 --> 42:20.750
After she became deaf.

42:21.375 --> 42:23.625
Wow, how sad.
How does she do?

42:25.750 --> 42:27.000
She crochets.

42:28.541 --> 42:29.791
Awesome!

42:39.625 --> 42:40.875
Your heel.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.250
I'm feeling like Cinderella.

42:44.541 --> 42:47.500
- And I, Lady Tremaine.
- Lady--

42:47.916 --> 42:49.250
The Wicked Stepmother.

42:49.833 --> 42:50.791
I'm sorry, okay?

42:50.875 --> 42:52.875
You can't go out
without letting me know.

42:52.958 --> 42:54.208
Forgive me.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.250
No, forgive me.

42:58.791 --> 43:01.708
No, you are right.
I should not have left like that.

43:01.791 --> 43:04.708
- Just wise up.
- It's just a cigarette.

43:06.625 --> 43:08.833
Okay then, take your time.

43:25.666 --> 43:28.416
You know, for a second
I almost believed it.

43:31.666 --> 43:32.833
Me too.

43:37.250 --> 43:39.166
Do you think I have any chance?

43:41.791 --> 43:42.708
Teylor.

43:44.291 --> 43:46.708
If I can nail my audition in the theater.

43:49.666 --> 43:50.750
What do you think?

43:51.125 --> 43:52.666
You just tricked me again.

43:57.291 --> 44:00.625
You will nail it, I'm sure.

44:08.375 --> 44:09.875
Sorry, I got held back.

44:11.250 --> 44:13.333
Can you order a Coke for me?

44:20.541 --> 44:21.583
You...

44:21.666 --> 44:24.083
You thought I was gonna come dressed up--

44:27.416 --> 44:28.458
Jeez.

44:31.541 --> 44:33.541
I knew I was gonna find you here.

44:35.375 --> 44:38.833
Yes. I'm here watching the stars.

44:41.291 --> 44:43.333
Maybe they tell me what to do.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.875
What is right.

44:46.833 --> 44:49.416
Oh, they never tell you anything, dear.

44:49.916 --> 44:51.916
Much less a moral lesson.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.500
Don't you repeat my mistake.

44:58.166 --> 45:01.041
For a silly betrayal, I--

45:01.166 --> 45:05.916
I ended it all.
I removed your mom from our lives.

45:06.541 --> 45:07.583
Yeah...

45:09.000 --> 45:11.791
But she went away
and could care less about us.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.625
She disappeared and never came back.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.041
Yes, but if I could find her now,
I would--

45:19.916 --> 45:22.375
I would tell her how much I love her.

45:22.916 --> 45:24.416
You say that now.

45:25.166 --> 45:28.166
But at the time you didn't forgive her.
Why should I forgive Joca?

45:28.250 --> 45:31.208
Because he loves you,
and because you are a woman.

45:32.916 --> 45:37.875
And because, we, men, are stupid
and you are not.

45:39.916 --> 45:41.166
Dream on.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.833
Sometimes I wish to run away from it all.

45:48.333 --> 45:50.291
Get in a car and disappear.

45:54.041 --> 45:57.375
Things are going by slowly.

45:58.750 --> 46:00.375
Time gets shorter.

46:01.666 --> 46:05.166
Life flies, time flies.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.708
I am at 80 mph.

46:09.541 --> 46:11.875
Images get blurry.

46:13.416 --> 46:15.541
I'm running away from myself.

46:16.166 --> 46:17.791
Running away from the past.

46:18.416 --> 46:20.666
From my haunted world.

46:24.166 --> 46:27.708
From sadness, from doubt.

46:30.375 --> 46:31.666
I'm at 90 mph.

46:32.916 --> 46:35.083
Running away from you.

46:35.166 --> 46:39.458
I'll move through life

46:39.666 --> 46:41.458
Not caring if I'll arrive

46:43.041 --> 46:46.416
Nothing's gonna change my route

46:46.916 --> 46:49.500
Or bring me back here

46:50.416 --> 46:53.791
I live running away

46:54.000 --> 46:56.875
Without any destination

46:57.416 --> 47:01.208
I follow paths that lead

47:01.500 --> 47:03.625
Lead me nowhere

47:05.750 --> 47:07.750
I travel

47:08.041 --> 47:10.666
I fly though life

47:10.750 --> 47:13.541
Not caring if I'll arrive

47:14.416 --> 47:17.416
Nothing's gonna change my route

47:17.541 --> 47:23.958
Nothing's gonna change my route
Or bring me back here

47:27.750 --> 47:31.541
I live running away

47:32.041 --> 47:34.375
Without any destination

47:38.625 --> 47:42.416
I follow paths that lead

47:43.041 --> 47:45.583
Lead me nowhere

47:48.750 --> 47:53.291
I'm not so sure of where I'll go

47:53.875 --> 47:56.541
Or when I'll stop

47:59.875 --> 48:02.083
No, I don't leave footprints

48:02.166 --> 48:03.458
Any news?

48:05.125 --> 48:07.291
So I won't know how to return

48:07.458 --> 48:11.333
The singer's wife is really beautiful.

48:11.458 --> 48:13.833
Sometimes
It feels like the world

48:15.000 --> 48:17.375
Forgot about me

48:17.541 --> 48:21.583
She is the love of his life.
He only thinks of her.

48:21.666 --> 48:22.583
No

48:22.708 --> 48:24.750
That's beautiful.

48:25.208 --> 48:27.625
You're gonna love that family.

48:27.708 --> 48:28.875
I already do.

48:28.958 --> 48:31.708
I don't know for how long
I'll live like that

48:31.833 --> 48:35.458
Sometimes
Sometimes it feels like the world

48:36.625 --> 48:38.666
Forgot about me

48:58.875 --> 49:00.000
Hello?

49:00.875 --> 49:01.916
Yes.

49:03.375 --> 49:05.333
Oh, I was waiting for your call.

49:07.875 --> 49:08.916
So?

49:10.000 --> 49:11.208
How was it?

49:12.500 --> 49:13.666
We got it?

49:33.208 --> 49:34.458
Dad!

49:44.875 --> 49:46.333
Sis!

49:48.375 --> 49:50.708
I missed you so bad.

49:51.458 --> 49:53.708
There were days I could not sleep...

49:56.625 --> 49:59.583
thinking of the loneliness
in that prison cell.

50:01.416 --> 50:02.416
Yes.

50:03.875 --> 50:05.958
In the beginning I thought
I was going to die.

50:09.208 --> 50:10.791
But would you believe...

50:13.375 --> 50:15.125
that even inside that prison,

50:15.208 --> 50:19.958
in that world without men,
I loved and was loved?

50:20.041 --> 50:21.500
Are you kidding?

50:22.208 --> 50:24.166
That's why you look so good!

50:24.250 --> 50:27.583
Really? Do I look good?
Beautiful?

50:33.500 --> 50:38.750
- And what was her name?
- Not was, is. Milene.

50:41.125 --> 50:42.375
Milene.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.625
Now that she's locked in there,
what are you gonna do?

50:46.625 --> 50:48.375
She won't be there for long.

50:49.125 --> 50:52.041
I'll get her out of there.
Milene is innocent.

50:52.416 --> 50:53.458
Sis?

50:55.500 --> 50:56.958
Mark my words.

51:02.333 --> 51:03.833
You're crazy.

51:04.375 --> 51:05.750
How about you?

51:06.750 --> 51:08.166
You never fell in love again?

51:10.333 --> 51:11.875
With someone inferior?

51:12.416 --> 51:14.000
My brother!

51:18.375 --> 51:20.875
I'll find Nadia one day.

51:22.250 --> 51:23.375
Mark my words.

51:25.625 --> 51:29.958
Even if she's eating this hateful dirt,
I'll find Nadia!

51:31.375 --> 51:35.250
Let me tell you tenderly

51:36.125 --> 51:39.500
Whatever I want

51:42.875 --> 51:46.500
Let me hold you with madness

51:47.333 --> 51:49.958
Until I suffocate you

51:54.125 --> 51:57.458
Let me be your shadow

51:58.541 --> 52:02.750
Wherever you go

52:05.375 --> 52:09.041
To reflect on the floor that you step on

52:09.916 --> 52:13.625
The image of this love

52:16.625 --> 52:20.375
Let me relax on your body

52:21.750 --> 52:25.208
My weariness

52:28.375 --> 52:30.208
Shelter myself from the cold

52:30.291 --> 52:36.125
In the heat of your embrace

52:39.375 --> 52:43.083
Let me kill you
With pleasure

52:44.083 --> 52:48.250
Drive me crazy

52:50.500 --> 52:53.250
Let me quench my thirst

52:55.125 --> 52:58.333
In your mouth

52:59.000 --> 53:02.416
But if none of that entices you

53:02.500 --> 53:03.416
Hey.

53:05.333 --> 53:08.458
Your sister is something, huh?

53:08.875 --> 53:10.791
You want to be in the family, right?

53:10.875 --> 53:13.333
Oh, I don't have anybody.

53:15.333 --> 53:17.625
Keep quiet

53:20.000 --> 53:26.125
Don't say a word

53:34.708 --> 53:36.791
We missed you.

53:38.750 --> 53:40.125
But you got along fine.

53:42.625 --> 53:43.958
No lack of love.

53:44.458 --> 53:48.208
- Right. No lack of love.
- I knew you would be loved.

53:48.750 --> 53:49.750
Yeah.

53:50.583 --> 53:52.208
You sing so beautifully, son.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.958
It's a different way of singing.

53:55.041 --> 53:57.750
I don't know, tragic.

53:58.416 --> 54:01.125
- It reminded me of Nadia.
- Celeste's mom?

54:01.458 --> 54:03.375
Yes, she used to sing like that.

54:04.208 --> 54:06.875
Like if she was gonna die
in the next minute.

54:07.750 --> 54:11.583
- Would lacerate us.
- That was not my intention.

54:11.666 --> 54:14.000
It was! Of course, it was!

54:20.250 --> 54:23.208
Mom, would you do me a favor?

54:26.291 --> 54:28.875
I've been waiting for that
for a long time.

54:33.125 --> 54:34.875
Odair, do you have five minutes?

54:34.958 --> 54:37.375
- I need your help.
- Sure.

54:37.458 --> 54:39.333
How can I help?

54:39.416 --> 54:42.541
Son, go to the ballroom, will you?
Wait for me there.

54:49.625 --> 54:51.333
Just a cigarette, Pepe.

55:31.458 --> 55:33.250
Do you know how to use this?

55:35.625 --> 55:37.208
I never used a computer.

55:38.125 --> 55:39.500
Let me see.

55:39.875 --> 55:40.875
May I?

55:47.125 --> 55:50.458
And if you want to research anything
you enter it here.

55:56.375 --> 55:58.083
And then you type it in here.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.375
There. Easy.

56:08.458 --> 56:09.541
Lost Paradise.

56:14.083 --> 56:15.666
You don't look like a cop.

56:16.833 --> 56:17.708
Yeah, well...

56:18.625 --> 56:19.666
but I am.

56:21.125 --> 56:23.458
Very different from the ones in prison.

56:28.083 --> 56:29.083
Oh?

56:30.333 --> 56:31.791
They haven't told you?

56:37.500 --> 56:39.041
I just got out of prison.

56:41.750 --> 56:45.583
Well, they told me you were returning
from a trip.

56:50.125 --> 56:53.666
Did your trip take long?

56:55.125 --> 56:57.708
Long enough to not feel ashamed
of anything.

56:59.750 --> 57:01.166
And how long was that?

57:03.500 --> 57:04.625
Twenty years.

57:11.958 --> 57:15.125
Do you need anything else?

57:21.875 --> 57:22.916
I do.

58:05.750 --> 58:06.791
Hi.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.916
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

58:10.041 --> 58:12.041
Look, I tried something in between.

58:13.458 --> 58:14.333
I noticed.

58:16.750 --> 58:17.875
What do you do?

58:18.750 --> 58:21.416
I teach English.

58:22.750 --> 58:26.291
You know,
there is a song I'm dying to sing,

58:26.375 --> 58:28.833
because it is just like me, sort of--

58:29.208 --> 58:32.458
- The name is "Your so Vain".
- "You're so Vain."

58:32.583 --> 58:35.000
- "You are so vain."
- Correct.

58:35.250 --> 58:38.416
So, I'd love to sing it.
Can you help me with the translation?

58:39.375 --> 58:42.583
I understand just a few things, such as...

58:43.500 --> 58:47.166
"You said that we made such a pretty pair,

58:47.250 --> 58:49.500
and that you would never leave."

58:52.625 --> 58:55.000
- Do you have it there?
- Yes, here.

58:58.625 --> 59:00.000
You want the other one?

59:20.250 --> 59:23.041
- Can you play it again, please?
- Sure.

01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:24.875
Hi, Milene!

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:32.041
Eva sent me here. Give me a hug!

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.541
Thanks.

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:53.125
Eva asked me to tell you
that she misses you.

01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:55.625
Who are you?

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:58.708
I'm a bouncer at the club
where her son works.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.333
And why are you dressed like a cop?

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:06.958
That's my daytime job.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.791
- How is Eva?
- Fine.

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:16.791
- She wants news about you.
- Does she talk about me?

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.208
She thinks about you all the time.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.958
How do you know?

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:27.750
Because all she has in her mind
is getting you out of here.

01:01:31.875 --> 01:01:35.500
She told me you are innocent.

01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:38.666
How did you end up here?

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:44.000
Didn't Eva tell you?

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:56.458
Tulé kidnapped my mom and forced me
to smuggle for him.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.625
You didn't tell that to the sheriff?

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.208
- No.
- Why?

01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:10.333
I was afraid of what could happen
with her.

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:14.666
And how did you meet?

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.416
- I went after him.
- Why?

01:02:20.833 --> 01:02:22.166
To ask for money.

01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:29.791
I wanted to give my mom
a decent burial.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.541
She was very sick.

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:41.291
Does your mom visit you often?

01:02:44.958 --> 01:02:46.291
Never.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:18.500
A worried man
Walking very worried

01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:21.750
No one in front of me
Nothing by my side

01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:23.958
A woman on my lap

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:27.333
And she drinks champagne

01:03:30.416 --> 01:03:31.958
- Pale skin, assassin eyes
- Here.

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:32.916
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:37.000
Eyes to the sky
With an old boy's look

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:39.083
I'm well dressed

01:03:39.625 --> 01:03:42.458
Waiting for the last train

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.500
Standing
On a scaffold

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:49.875
With my neck in a noose

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:55.250
I have a second and a half
More or less

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:57.708
To figure out what to do

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:03.458
Crazy people
Weird times

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:06.666
I'm locked up
I cannot reach

01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:09.416
- All good?
- I cared

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:12.625
But everything is changing

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:17.625
Careful with my cuticle.
It's very delicate.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.458
I should be in Hollywood

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:23.000
For a second

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:24.666
CANCER CENTER OF SAO PAULO

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.041
I thought I saw something moving

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:33.000
Take dance lessons
Go to Candomblé

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:36.625
Face life as you can
Go wherever you want

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:39.333
Only a fool would think

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:42.291
That there is nothing to say

01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:50.833
A lot of water under the bridge
Many other things too

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:54.625
Don't get up, gentleman

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:57.625
I'm just passing by

01:05:00.083 --> 01:05:03.625
Crazy people
Weird times

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:06.833
I'm locked up
I cannot reach

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:12.541
I cared
But everything is changing

01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:15.416
Mom.

01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:20.333
Come with me back to life!

01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:26.750
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:05:32.333 --> 01:05:33.416
Teylor?

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.458
- Is it a stage name?
- Pseudonym.

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:39.958
It says here, you're a singer.
No previous experience as an actor.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.458
I played in life.
Since I was kid.

01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:44.541
How is that?

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.833
Played dead,
so I wouldn't get shot.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.666
Laughed of wrong things,
so I wouldn't get shot.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.458
Pretended to be a journalist,
so I wouldn't get shot.

01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:55.083
Hey, cousin?
How is it with Pedro?

01:05:55.166 --> 01:05:57.750
Well... Come in!

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.000
- Excuse me.
- Hi!

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:01.958
Odair!

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.166
I have gifts from my mom.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.166
- She did them herself.
- Wow.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:09.208
This is for you, Celeste.

01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:10.875
- Thank you.
- This is for you, Imã.

01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:12.333
Thank you so much, Odair.

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:18.166
Oh my, this crochet is gorgeous!

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:21.666
- That's it.
- Thank you.

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:26.208
- See you later.
- Later.

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:34.458
You walked into the party

01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:38.708
Like you were walking
Onto a yacht

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:42.750
Your hat strategically dipped
Below one eye

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:47.083
Your scarf
It was apricot

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:51.875
You had one eye in the mirror

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:56.166
As you watched yourself gavotte

01:06:56.583 --> 01:07:00.541
And all the girls dreamed
That they'd be your partner

01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:03.458
They'd be your partner, and

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:05.750
You're so vain

01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:10.666
You probably think
This song is about you

01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.666
You're so vain

01:07:14.166 --> 01:07:18.125
I'll bet you think
This song is about you

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:21.250
Don't you?
Don't you?

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:26.041
You had me several years ago

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:29.125
When I was still quite naive

01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:30.791
You look great.

01:07:30.875 --> 01:07:34.875
When you said
That we made such a pretty pair

01:07:35.041 --> 01:07:38.000
And that you would never leave

01:07:39.416 --> 01:07:43.791
But you gave away the things you loved

01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:47.333
And one of them was me

01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:51.625
I had some dreams
They were clouds in my coffee

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.333
Clouds in my coffee, and

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:57.291
You're so vain

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.875
You probably think
This song is about you

01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:04.166
You're so vain

01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:08.708
I'll bet you think
This song is about you

01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:12.125
Don't you?
Don't you?

01:08:19.916 --> 01:08:21.082
Kinsman, do you--

01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:25.000
- Oh, sorry.
- No, that's fine, cousin.

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:26.582
- That's fine.
- He's cute.

01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:29.041
Pedro, this is Celeste, my cousin.

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.500
Pedro translated
"You're So Vain" for me.

01:08:31.582 --> 01:08:34.457
Oh, cool, it was really nice.

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:36.500
Thanks.

01:08:36.582 --> 01:08:38.916
Imã, were you with Joca?

01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:41.666
I helped to choose.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.500
So, I sent him a message

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:47.082
saying that I was super touched

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:50.707
and that I loved it.
He replied with a happy emoji face.

01:08:50.791 --> 01:08:54.875
- You didn't like his happy emoji?
- No, it's not that. It's just--

01:08:55.375 --> 01:08:57.125
What does that mean?

01:08:57.207 --> 01:09:01.125
Like "Oh, I'm glad you liked the gift,
but we are done."

01:09:01.207 --> 01:09:03.957
The happy emoji means
he is happy, that's all.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.500
What do you think, Pedro?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.832
- What is the context?
- What?

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.041
You broke up?
How was the relationship?

01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:15.875
Oh, it's...

01:09:16.207 --> 01:09:18.791
Well, he cheated on me.
I was really hurt

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:21.082
and I made a scene so he would leave.

01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:24.000
- Some 3D scene.
- Then he sent the baby shoes?

01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:28.125
Yes, with this note: "Uncle Imã, love it."

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:29.832
I think he is a nice guy.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.541
And that he loves you and will fight
to get you back.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.082
- You really think?
- I do.

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:39.500
- Well, I gotta go.
- No, stay! I need to go.

01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:42.207
No, I have a class to teach
in the morning.

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:45.625
Congrats, it was really special.

01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:58.250
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.250
Why do you have that face?

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:20.416
Nothing.

01:10:21.583 --> 01:10:23.500
I know you. Spill the beans.

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:34.625
You and Odair?

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.666
- Yes.
- I knew it!

01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:45.958
So, that story with Milene won't--

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:48.000
Yes!

01:10:48.833 --> 01:10:52.250
Shi-- Eva, Eva, Eva, Eva.

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:54.500
Don't worry.

01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:58.333
I do worry.

01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:08.208
You are nuts!

01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:10.416
You are nuts.

01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:18.333
I missed you.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.000
I wasn't pretending,
I did miss you.

01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:44.416
Your visit did me some good.

01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:48.666
I even dreamed again.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:52.791
That's good.

01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:58.625
Is this the guy?

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:08.458
It is him.

01:12:14.833 --> 01:12:16.541
You'll be out of here soon.

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.166
You want me out?

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:21.833
You will be out of here.

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:27.791
Tell Eva I miss her really badly?

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:33.416
I miss her kisses.

01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:40.083
I dream of putting my mouth on hers.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:46.458
I miss her scent, her body,

01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:49.166
the way she touched me.

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:55.208
Will you tell her?

01:13:03.541 --> 01:13:05.041
Excuse me.

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:06.333
Ângelo!

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.000
- Where were you?
- Where is Odair?

01:13:09.083 --> 01:13:11.666
He was here, but left.
It seems he had an issue at home.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.583
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

01:13:13.666 --> 01:13:16.166
Call him, please.
I'm worried.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.333
I saw some dudes around the corner.

01:13:18.416 --> 01:13:20.958
I'm worried, I didn't like it.
Very weird.

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:23.666
- Very weird.
- Voicemail.

01:13:24.125 --> 01:13:25.458
Try his house, please.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:50.791
I...

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.125
Deaf.

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:57.583
My son not here.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:04.458
Keep trying his cellphone.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.791
- I have to announce you.
- How come? Where's Imã?

01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:10.125
Went to a baby clothes manufacturer
with Joca,

01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:13.666
but they are stuck in traffic.
I don't know, some protests.

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:20.208
"I Don't Believe in Anything Anymore,"

01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:21.250
Paulo Sérgio.

01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:28.083
BODY AND SOUL
FREE

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:33.625
I don't know what to do

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:36.625
My life is an endless struggle

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:39.416
I feel like floating in space

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.250
All the time looking for myself

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.083
There are days in life

01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:47.916
That we think
We're not gonna make it

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That the best thing would be
To run away and escape

01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:54.416
That in another world
Everything will be solved

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.500
I don't know what to do

01:14:56.583 --> 01:14:59.333
If I go back now
Or continue my journey

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:02.125
I feel so tired

01:15:02.375 --> 01:15:05.375
And I don't know
If it's worth insisting

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:07.916
There are days in life

01:15:08.458 --> 01:15:10.875
That we think
We're not gonna make it

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.666
That the best thing would be
To run away and escape

01:15:13.791 --> 01:15:17.291
That in another world
Everything will be solved

01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:19.875
I don't believe in anything anymore

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.291
I got lost on the road

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.875
I no longer look for love

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:28.000
I just got used walking alone

01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:30.625
All my life I stepped on thorns

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:33.500
I realized that my destiny
Is sorrow and pain

01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:35.166
You won't pass!

01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:45.500
It's been so long
since I last joined a protest.

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:47.375
- By the way--
- Yeah?

01:15:47.583 --> 01:15:50.875
We're so screwed because we got late
thanks to that.

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:53.500
- Don't worry.
- I don't care, I had fun!

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:56.583
- Had fun with what?
- What is that?

01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:00.041
Run, Imã! Go!

01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:03.750
Pepe!

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:26.291
Stop! Not my dad! Get out!

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:31.666
Stop! Enough! Quit fighting!

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:34.375
Police!

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.916
Come on, come on!
On the wall!

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.416
On the wall! Get up!
Hands on the head!

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.625
- Busted.
- Hands on the head!

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:43.125
- Are you okay, dad?
- I'm fine, son.

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:46.875
- What kind of crap was that?
- Keep an eye on him, Teylor!

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:03.750
Well...

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.416
The patient had a head injury,

01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:12.041
his left eye sunk in,
multiple fractures of the face bones.

01:17:12.166 --> 01:17:14.583
He is being prepared for surgery.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.500
Any serious damage to the brain,
doctor?

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:20.166
Apparently not. I think he will be fine.

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:22.250
What worries me now

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:23.666
is his left eye sight.

01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:40.250
I'd like to thank you for what you've done
for all of us.

01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:47.625
Yes, but I'm really sorry
for what happened to Imã and Joca.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.500
It is not easy to take care
of this family.

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:57.583
We should hire some backup.

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:02.791
- I called your cellphone.
- I saw later.

01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:06.916
And then I called your house.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.541
Your mom is deaf, Odair?

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.333
Yes.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:19.750
- But she speaks a little.
- Yes, but it is hard for her.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:23.041
It's like walking in the dark.

01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:28.333
She lost her hearing as an adult.

01:18:28.416 --> 01:18:30.666
Degenerative disease.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.791
Violence victim.

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:40.166
And why didn't you help her?

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:44.625
She was expecting me when it all happened.

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:46.083
And your dad?

01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:49.333
He assaulted her.

01:18:54.375 --> 01:18:55.625
If you excuse me.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:57.833
Odair.

01:19:04.958 --> 01:19:06.666
Sometimes I think that...

01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:10.750
it was God who sent you our way.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.958
I just hope he knows what he's doing.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.916
Why "volcano," dad?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.375
I don't know, maybe it has to do
with mythology.

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:53.708
Mythology?

01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:57.750
Mythology is a bunch of fantastic stories,
with plenty of super heroes.

01:19:57.833 --> 01:20:02.041
Like Wonder Woman,
Spider-Man, Batman.

01:20:03.125 --> 01:20:06.625
When Volcano was born,
his dad tried to kill him.

01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:09.541
But he survived.

01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:11.791
Why did his dad try to kill him?

01:20:16.083 --> 01:20:18.208
So, he could become the god of fire.

01:20:19.083 --> 01:20:22.250
Forge the armor Achilles needed
to win the Trojan war.

01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:24.166
The one with the horse.

01:20:24.708 --> 01:20:25.833
That one.

01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:29.541
A horse created by Odysseus
so they would win the war

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:31.083
and reunite the family.

01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:33.958
- Did he win?
- He did.

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:37.750
It took a while, but he did win.

01:20:45.083 --> 01:20:46.750
My flower

01:20:47.416 --> 01:20:49.416
Do not hurt me

01:20:49.541 --> 01:20:51.125
My pain

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:55.166
Do not abuse me like this

01:20:55.958 --> 01:21:01.166
Don't give me grief
Take away all the grief from me

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.875
My love

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:09.000
Do not invade me with your eyes

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:13.625
Do not leave me here screaming

01:21:13.708 --> 01:21:16.041
In the middle of the way

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:18.875
Alone

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:27.000
My love
Do not let it show

01:21:27.125 --> 01:21:31.333
Any desire in your eyes

01:21:31.416 --> 01:21:36.916
Of Forbidden
Forgotten Sins

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:39.750
Milene will leave prison tomorrow.

01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:57.500
And tonight?

01:21:59.708 --> 01:22:01.333
What will happen tonight?

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:11.958
To hush

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:16.625
The flimsiest sex

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:21.000
To turn it into poetry

01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:25.916
From this love
From this desperado love

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.541
I'll go, I'll go

01:22:29.541 --> 01:22:33.875
Go-oooo

01:22:48.708 --> 01:22:54.041
Go-oooo

01:23:02.958 --> 01:23:09.375
Breathing
Grief from another pain

01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:13.416
From our immoral affair

01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:19.125
From this love
From this desperado love

01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:22.833
I'll go...

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:25.458
Thank you, Eva.

01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:30.041
Nobody ever did anything for me.

01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:38.625
Now you have both of us.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.375
What do you think about Odair?

01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:48.416
Uppity.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.708
Not in bed.

01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:09.875
Odair?

01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:15.708
Do you think it is possible
for someone to love two people?

01:25:16.666 --> 01:25:17.916
At the same time?

01:25:20.208 --> 01:25:21.500
Madly.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.708
I don't think so, Imã.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.500
I agree.

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:33.583
Is there anybody else besides Pedro?

01:25:34.958 --> 01:25:36.625
I was talking about my mom!

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:44.750
Come back, my love

01:25:45.375 --> 01:25:49.750
Stay with me
Do not despise me

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:51.416
The night is ours

01:25:52.208 --> 01:25:57.000
And my love belongs to you

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.666
Tonight, I want peace

01:26:04.208 --> 01:26:08.625
I want tenderness in our lives

01:26:08.708 --> 01:26:13.500
I want to live for a lifetime

01:26:13.583 --> 01:26:16.333
Thinking of you

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.541
Tonight, that the night is calm

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:40.833
And that my soul waited for you

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.250
You came at last

01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:50.500
Torturing this being that adores you

01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:54.291
Come back

01:26:55.208 --> 01:26:59.583
Stay with me just one more night

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.458
I want to live with you

01:27:07.375 --> 01:27:11.250
Tonight, I want peace

01:27:11.583 --> 01:27:15.958
I want tenderness in our lives

01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:20.708
I want to live for a lifetime

01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:23.750
Thinking of you

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:48.500
Tonight, I want peace

01:27:49.208 --> 01:27:53.291
I want tenderness in our lives

01:27:53.375 --> 01:27:58.041
I want to live for a lifetime

01:27:59.958 --> 01:28:03.000
Thinking of you

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.041
Let me ask you a question.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:18.666
What did the doctor say
about the latest exams?

01:28:19.958 --> 01:28:23.375
He said that my treatment had
excellent results.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.666
It was like rewinding
the tape back to the start.

01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:32.000
- Thank you, son.
- Why?

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:33.708
For supporting me on this fight.

01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:36.500
For keeping the secret.

01:28:37.416 --> 01:28:41.125
- Thank you for your friendship.
- You're thanking me?

01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:44.458
Do you realize all the things
you have done for me?

01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:50.041
Come, I have a gift.

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:53.208
A hot-dog for the cutest birthday girl
in the world.

01:28:53.291 --> 01:28:55.041
Loads of sauce, please.
Be merciless.

01:28:55.125 --> 01:28:56.833
- Relentless.
- Right!

01:29:01.583 --> 01:29:03.583
- Happy birthday!
- Come on, everybody!

01:29:05.083 --> 01:29:07.916
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hip!

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.458
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

01:29:11.541 --> 01:29:14.291
Friday, it's Friday
Tonight no one will find me

01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:16.875
The battery on my cell is dead
Friday

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.875
It's Friday
I'll show up in the morning

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.416
Holding a new love

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.791
Friday, it's Friday
Tonight no one will find me

01:29:25.875 --> 01:29:28.250
The battery on my cell is dead
Friday

01:29:28.375 --> 01:29:31.291
It's Friday
I'll show up in the morning

01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:33.916
Holding a new love

01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:40.000
Why living like that?
Every day is Friday

01:29:40.916 --> 01:29:43.125
Eva looks beautiful, don't you think?

01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:46.833
Yeah, she's happy.

01:29:47.708 --> 01:29:48.875
Like never before.

01:29:52.625 --> 01:29:55.666
What do I have to do
to deserve that happiness?

01:29:57.708 --> 01:29:58.625
Deserve?

01:30:00.208 --> 01:30:01.458
She killed a man!

01:30:02.875 --> 01:30:04.166
It was self-defense.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.625
That's bullshit.

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:10.916
The cop was sleeping.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.750
He was taking care of his little son.

01:30:35.916 --> 01:30:37.500
Here it is, Odair.

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:42.625
I was able to find all the files
regarding your dad's murder.

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:45.500
Eva da Silva.

01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:51.333
She was just 18
when she committed the crime.

01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:01.250
And there is another thing, Odair?

01:31:01.958 --> 01:31:06.083
This prisoner you helped out, this Milene.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.041
She is innocent,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.125
but a con artist.
Open your eyes.

01:31:12.208 --> 01:31:16.250
Her mom was never kidnapped
because she never existed.

01:31:16.333 --> 01:31:20.708
The little bastard grew up in a shelter.
She lived with that Tulé guy.

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:25.375
He dumped her and she threatened
to blow all his schemes--

01:31:39.958 --> 01:31:41.000
José.

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:44.333
Hey, Odair!

01:31:46.208 --> 01:31:49.000
What did you have in mind
when you attracted me to this place?

01:31:50.875 --> 01:31:53.125
The same you have in mind now.

01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:01.833
You never had any doubts things
might not happen as planned.

01:32:03.125 --> 01:32:06.416
- Why?
- Because I didn't have a better choice.

01:32:07.833 --> 01:32:08.958
Choice?

01:32:09.375 --> 01:32:11.625
How deep do you think
you know the facts?

01:32:12.625 --> 01:32:14.583
Do you know who killed my father, José?

01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:20.333
When I was seven,
my mom was in the hospital,

01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:21.875
in a coma.

01:32:23.708 --> 01:32:26.125
I lived with my dad when he was murdered.

01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:28.708
He was a police Captain.

01:32:34.083 --> 01:32:35.750
I did not know that, son.

01:32:37.833 --> 01:32:42.083
And do you know why
Eva killed your father?

01:32:42.875 --> 01:32:45.125
- Imã's father?
- Grandpa?

01:32:45.791 --> 01:32:47.000
Grandpa!

01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:52.166
What's with the grumpy faces?
I'll be back later.

01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:54.916
- No, no. Stay Imã.
- Okay, I'll be brief.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.166
Grandpa, tonight I'll sing a song
and I'm very happy.

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:02.250
- It is in English.
- Why the novelty?

01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:07.083
Oh, it's because I'm completely in love...

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:08.833
with that language.

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:11.375
It's a song from Kill Bill,
which I love.

01:33:11.458 --> 01:33:13.958
- Kill Bill?
- That's right, Grandpa.

01:33:14.375 --> 01:33:16.125
Have you seen that movie, Odair?

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:20.625
You have to see it, Odair.
It's the story of my life.

01:33:20.875 --> 01:33:23.125
I have a bunch of copies.
I'll fetch one for you--

01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:26.125
Grandpa?

01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:29.375
- Are you sad?
- Grandpa?

01:33:30.833 --> 01:33:33.125
Grandpa is sad, Kinswoman.

01:33:33.458 --> 01:33:37.166
What is it, Grandpa?
Why so emotional?

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:42.875
Odair told me a sad story.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.958
- What was it, Odair?
- What happened?

01:33:53.375 --> 01:33:55.125
I'll have to go away for a while.

01:33:57.583 --> 01:34:00.958
- To fix some family issues.
- For how long?

01:34:02.625 --> 01:34:04.000
It's hard to tell.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.708
You know you can count on us.

01:34:07.791 --> 01:34:09.750
We'll be here for you.

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:14.416
He knows that, Celeste.

01:34:17.958 --> 01:34:20.375
Take care, you two.

01:34:39.125 --> 01:34:40.208
Ângelo?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.250
What happened?

01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:52.375
I wanted to say goodbye.

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.583
I'm leaving.

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:59.958
Why, Odair?
Does it have to do with Eva?

01:35:00.375 --> 01:35:03.541
Well, it does and it doesn't.

01:35:04.875 --> 01:35:08.083
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- No. You don't need to.

01:35:11.375 --> 01:35:12.666
Talk to your dad.

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:15.666
He'll tell you everything.

01:35:17.375 --> 01:35:18.958
I beg you to do that.

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:22.583
Okay, then.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.125
Dad!

01:35:45.541 --> 01:35:47.041
What is going on?

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.625
Odair.

01:35:50.083 --> 01:35:51.291
Why did he leave?

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.583
Tell me, dad!

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:59.416
- Odair--
- Is Nadia's son.

01:36:01.416 --> 01:36:02.625
Nadia's?

01:36:04.375 --> 01:36:05.791
Your Nadia?

01:36:10.958 --> 01:36:11.875
So...

01:36:11.958 --> 01:36:13.583
He's Celeste's brother.

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:16.750
Oh, my God!

01:36:17.125 --> 01:36:18.166
So, he is my--

01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:20.000
He's nothing yours, sis.

01:36:24.875 --> 01:36:27.125
He's nothing yours, honey.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.625
Who's his dad?

01:36:36.916 --> 01:36:38.916
He was murdered.

01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:41.250
Twenty years ago.

01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:44.083
By a woman.

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:48.750
Odair is son of the man you killed, sis.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.666
And tonight, at our Christmas night,

01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:45.375
our god singing "One Who Wants All,
Will Have Nothing."

01:37:47.583 --> 01:37:51.500
One who wants all from love
Will have nothing

01:37:52.875 --> 01:37:57.125
One who lives many dreams
Doesn't have a thing

01:37:58.208 --> 01:38:01.541
In each of us there is

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:03.750
There should be room

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.250
For just one love

01:38:08.458 --> 01:38:12.375
Who wandered a lot in life
Got tired

01:38:13.625 --> 01:38:17.291
Behind me
Fate has disappeared

01:38:18.833 --> 01:38:21.250
Who put his heart on the line

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.750
Ran after love their entire life

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.875
They lived
But never loved

01:38:28.833 --> 01:38:32.666
Happiness is

01:38:34.125 --> 01:38:38.875
The little, one has

01:38:39.125 --> 01:38:43.500
Happiness is

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.083
Knowing how to love someone

01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:24.833
Could you do me a favor?

01:39:27.291 --> 01:39:32.916
Deliver that note
to the male singer's sister?

01:39:34.375 --> 01:39:36.750
You go there and deliver it.

01:39:39.041 --> 01:39:41.083
Please?

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.250
What's her name?

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Don't worry.
You'll know when you see her.

01:39:55.958 --> 01:39:57.583
Please.

01:40:01.666 --> 01:40:05.333
One who wants all from love
Will have nothing

01:40:06.625 --> 01:40:10.875
One who lives many dreams
Doesn't have a thing

01:40:11.875 --> 01:40:14.500
In all of our hearts

01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:16.708
There will be enough room

01:40:17.125 --> 01:40:19.916
Only for another heart

01:40:42.625 --> 01:40:47.416
Happiness is

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.958
The little, one has

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.083
Happiness is

01:40:58.125 --> 01:41:02.583
Knowing how to love someone

01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:07.333
One who wants all from love
Will have nothing

01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:12.875
One who lives many dreams
Doesn't have a thing

01:41:13.833 --> 01:41:15.750
In all of our hearts

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.958
There will be enough room

01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:22.125
Only for another heart

01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:38.833
I've been so tired

01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:42.375
From the weight of my head

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:48.458
From the past and present
Ten years I lived

01:41:49.708 --> 01:41:53.958
Between dreams and sounds

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:57.333
I've been so tired

01:41:57.583 --> 01:42:01.333
Of not being able to speak

01:42:01.833 --> 01:42:04.291
About these awkward things

01:42:04.375 --> 01:42:06.583
That I bring in my chest

01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:11.875
And that I love so much

01:42:13.083 --> 01:42:15.375
I want a new ballad

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:19.125
Talking about babes
And things like that

01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:22.833
About money and the moon
About you and me

01:42:22.958 --> 01:42:27.250
Such a sentimental guy

01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:30.083
I want a new ballad

01:42:30.875 --> 01:42:34.000
Talking about babes
And things like that

01:42:34.083 --> 01:42:37.416
About money and the moon
About you and me

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.750
Are you okay?

01:42:38.833 --> 01:42:41.625
Such a sentimental guy

01:42:42.875 --> 01:42:45.791
I want that 5 o'clock
Movie session

01:42:45.875 --> 01:42:49.666
So I can kiss the girl
And then go home

01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:55.125
With her presence
In the lipstick on my shirt

01:42:57.708 --> 01:43:00.625
I want that 5 o'clock
Movie session

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:04.250
So I can kiss the gir--
And then go home--

01:43:04.333 --> 01:43:09.416
With her presence
In the lipstick on my shirt

01:43:11.625 --> 01:43:14.041
I've been so--

01:43:23.291 --> 01:43:25.625
Show me the paid tab.

01:43:26.250 --> 01:43:27.750
You gotta pay first.

01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:29.708
No.

01:43:30.458 --> 01:43:31.666
You gotta pay first.

01:43:35.625 --> 01:43:38.000
Pepe, leave her.
You may leave her alone.

01:43:40.208 --> 01:43:41.500
She's with me.

01:43:43.666 --> 01:43:48.625
...That I love so much

01:43:49.083 --> 01:43:51.500
I want a new ballad

01:43:51.583 --> 01:43:55.083
Talking about babes
And things like that

About money and the moon
About you and me

01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:03.208
Such a sentimental guy

01:44:03.583 --> 01:44:06.041
I want a new ballad

01:44:06.166 --> 01:44:09.875
Talking about babes
And things like that

01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:13.708
About money and the moon
About you and me

01:44:13.875 --> 01:44:18.416
Such a sentimental guy

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:21.666
I want that 5 o'clock
Movie session

01:44:21.791 --> 01:44:25.375
So I can kiss the girl
