WEBVTT

00:03.202 --> 00:04.703
If anyone should
be getting married,

00:04.737 --> 00:07.306
it should be Ricky and me,
not Adrian and Ben.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.308
This is my mother.
This is Nora.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.510
Nora, George.
George, Nora.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.178
How's six weeks from today?

00:13.212 --> 00:14.479
For?

00:14.514 --> 00:16.381
Ben, for the wedding.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.717
I think you're a really
interesting woman.

00:18.751 --> 00:20.719
I don't think
I've ever met anyone
who's been to prison.

00:20.753 --> 00:23.288
Oh, you probably have.
Maybe.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.691
I asked Adrian to marry me,
and she said yes,

00:25.725 --> 00:28.960
and we're getting married,
and when and where
are her decisions.

00:28.995 --> 00:32.197
Adrian wants our son
to be ringbearer at this circus,

00:32.231 --> 00:34.066
and she wants Amy
to be a bridesmaid.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.234
My dad's okay
with your coming over

00:36.269 --> 00:38.570
as long as we're not doing
what we were doing.

00:38.604 --> 00:41.707
Would it be stupid
if the two of us
actually had sex?

00:41.741 --> 00:43.709
I thought you wanted me
to sleep over
so we could have sex.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.243
I don't wanna have sex
with any guy

00:45.278 --> 00:46.912
unless there's a chance
we're gonna get married.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.413
I think it would be better

00:48.448 --> 00:50.549
if we asked my dad

00:50.583 --> 00:52.551
to buy us a condo.

00:52.585 --> 00:53.985
A condo?

00:54.020 --> 00:55.387
Ricky,

00:57.056 --> 00:58.724
will you marry me?

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.572 --> 01:15.273
You wanna bring John
over tonight, or do you
want me to pick him up?

01:15.308 --> 01:18.276
I'm fine picking him up,
but you're welcome
to come over, too.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.845
Whatever you want.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.347
No. Whatever you want.
I'm fine with whatever you want.

01:22.382 --> 01:25.851
All right. Then maybe
you could drop him off,
if you don't mind.

01:25.885 --> 01:27.319
I don't mind.
But it's not a date.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.054
I think I'll just spend
some time with John tonight.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.056
All right.
See you later.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.091
But not for a date.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.999
Just, uh, tell her you're
not gonna marry her. Yeah.

01:41.033 --> 01:42.834
You're not gonna marry her.
I said, "We'll see."

01:42.869 --> 01:45.470
I'll think about it,
but I'm not getting married
while I'm in high school.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.739
What about in June?
You'll be graduating in June.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.141
No, not in June.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.909
July? Oh, August.

01:50.943 --> 01:52.477
[sighs]
Admit it.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.980
You're one step away from being
in the same boat I'm in.

01:55.014 --> 01:57.249
No, I'm not.
Find a condo yet?

01:57.283 --> 01:58.717
No, not yet.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.052
So the one
you looked at last night
didn't work out either?

02:01.087 --> 02:02.788
No. No. These things
take time, you know?

02:02.822 --> 02:04.723
We just started looking,
we're on a limited budget,

02:04.757 --> 02:06.725
so I doubt we'll buy anything
right away.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.627
Yeah, especially if
you're not ready to leave home.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.096
Who's not ready
to leave home at 17, huh?

02:11.130 --> 02:13.965
It's every teenager's dream
to get their own home at 17.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.634
Yeah, and a wife and a baby.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.469
You get your life
over with in your teen years,

02:17.503 --> 02:19.137
and then there's just
nothing else to do

02:19.172 --> 02:20.539
but kick back and watch

02:20.573 --> 02:22.574
every dream you ever had
go straight to hell.

02:22.608 --> 02:24.242
[chuckles]

02:24.277 --> 02:27.245
It's looking that way,
but it'll all be fine.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.414
Yeah. That's what
I keep saying to myself:

02:29.449 --> 02:31.249
"It'll all be fine."

02:31.284 --> 02:33.518
Yeah.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.989
I guess I'd wanna wait
until we both graduated
from high school.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.058
Then again,
he is graduating this year,

02:40.092 --> 02:42.060
and then I only have
a year left of high school.

02:42.094 --> 02:43.962
So whatever.
I'm not really in any hurry.

02:43.996 --> 02:45.997
I heard you asked Ricky
to marry you.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.666
Nice going, girlfriend.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.935
Good luck with that
nontraditional approach.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.139
Well, what was
his answer, exactly?

02:54.173 --> 02:55.640
He said he'd think
about it.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.176
No. He said, "We'll see."
It's a totally different thing.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.545
Well, it's different,
but it's not exactly a "yes."

03:00.580 --> 03:02.614
It's not a "no."
And coming from Ricky,

03:02.648 --> 03:04.115
I think it's a "yes."

03:04.150 --> 03:06.318
I mean, I didn't expect him
to say "yes" right away.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.819
He has to think about things,

03:07.854 --> 03:09.421
and he has to feel in control.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.190
And I'm definitely going
to let him feel in control
of his decision.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.725
I gotta say,
I'm impressed

03:13.759 --> 03:15.227
that you went out
on a limb, Amy,

03:15.261 --> 03:17.095
and just asked
for what you wanted.

03:17.129 --> 03:18.797
I think that's brave.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.199
Either brave
or completely foolish.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.301
Good morning.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.303
Obviously she didn't approve.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.305
Well, uh, how long
do you think

03:27.340 --> 03:29.341
it'll take Ricky to see
that he's gonna marry you?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.476
He needs time.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.248
Oh. Good morning.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.216
Did I know you were
coming by this morning?

03:38.251 --> 03:40.519
I don't know.
Here's my work.
See you next week.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.387
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.

03:42.421 --> 03:44.523
That's not how this works.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.925
We have to go over
your assignments.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.994
Not even we.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.897
The school has a new teacher
who's overseeing home schooling.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.399
Mr. Malkovich.
Let me go get him for you.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.401
I wish you had told me.

03:56.435 --> 03:58.670
My dad's waiting outside.

03:58.704 --> 04:00.338
I don't really have time.

04:00.373 --> 04:03.341
Yes. I'm sure you're
very busy at home.

04:06.712 --> 04:08.613
Hi, Angel.
Nadine, good morning.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.649
Jeff, what's up, man?

04:10.683 --> 04:12.918
Hey, uh, Ricky,
I need to talk to you.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.153
When you have time.

04:15.187 --> 04:17.188
What's that about?

04:17.223 --> 04:19.591
I don't know.
What does she do?
She's the counselor.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.259
No. I know
she's the counselor.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.694
What does she do?

04:22.728 --> 04:25.196
She counsels students
on school

04:25.231 --> 04:27.732
and what classes to take,
where to go to college.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.702
Stuff like that.
Yeah, well, I'm not
going to college.

04:30.736 --> 04:33.305
Yeah, well, you already
have a job and a family.
That's totally understandable.

04:33.339 --> 04:36.474
I'm glad you think so.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.112
I don't wanna
do it in my room

04:41.147 --> 04:43.248
'cause it's so close
to my mom and Jeff's,

04:43.282 --> 04:45.550
and they have no plans
to go anywhere for months.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.019
Mm-hmm.
There's always
the guest house,

04:48.054 --> 04:50.121
but then I'd have to strike
some sort of deal

04:50.156 --> 04:51.957
with Tom and Jack,

04:51.991 --> 04:53.959
and then
they'd know about it.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.961
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel right,
you know?

04:55.995 --> 04:58.563
To do what we wanna do
in Jack's bed.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.131
Hi, Adrian.
Hi.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.100
Would it be possible
to talk to you alone, Grace?

05:02.134 --> 05:03.568
Yeah, sure.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.503
But anything you wanna say,
you can say in front of Adrian.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.038
She's my best friend.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.708
Bye.

05:11.510 --> 05:14.412
My mom's going out of town
with my dad tonight,

05:14.447 --> 05:17.282
so we have my house
all to ourselves.

05:18.517 --> 05:20.051
We don't have to do anything.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.053
But if you wanna do something,

05:22.088 --> 05:23.788
we do have my house
all to ourselves.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.192
And it's okay with my parents
if you comover.

05:27.226 --> 05:28.893
It's even okay
if you spend the night.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.028
Your house?

05:31.163 --> 05:33.298
Your bed?

05:33.332 --> 05:35.300
I don't really know
if I feel comfortable with that.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.302
I've slept over at your house,
in your bed.

05:37.336 --> 05:39.170
Yeah...

05:39.205 --> 05:41.473
But I don't know.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.247
Good morning.

05:49.281 --> 05:51.249
Hey, look,
I'm sorry about last night.

05:51.283 --> 05:53.952
I guess I'm being just
a little picky about the condo.

05:54.954 --> 05:56.421
I guess you are.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.823
But that's okay.
We have more to look at tonight.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.393
Really?
Um, are you up for it?

06:01.427 --> 06:03.428
I mean, we've looked at places
every night this week.

06:03.462 --> 06:04.763
Maybe you should get some rest.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.731
Are you kidding?
Next to the baby,

06:06.766 --> 06:09.701
this is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened
to me in my life.

06:09.735 --> 06:11.236
Bye, Benny.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.937
Benny?

06:12.972 --> 06:14.272
Benny?

06:14.306 --> 06:16.941
I'm really okay
with that.

06:16.976 --> 06:17.976
Sure you are.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.144
I am.

06:19.178 --> 06:20.845
I've accepted my fate.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.681
Except for
the "moving out
of your house" part.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.817
Yeah, maybe not that.

06:47.165 --> 06:48.632
Ashley.

06:48.666 --> 06:51.101
Richard Malkovich.
Nice to meet you.

06:51.135 --> 06:52.769
Let's see
how you're doing.

06:52.804 --> 06:54.971
Yeah. Or I could just
leave that stuff with you.

06:55.006 --> 06:57.340
Ah. Antisocial.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.476
My favorite.

06:59.510 --> 07:01.478
You have any friends?

07:01.512 --> 07:03.046
Yeah, I have friends.
Who?

07:03.080 --> 07:05.215
Well, that's kind of
personal information, isn't it?

07:05.249 --> 07:07.651
I mean, if I tell you,
you might post it
on the Internet.

07:07.685 --> 07:09.653
Never mind.
I already know.

07:09.687 --> 07:11.755
I talked to your father.

07:11.789 --> 07:13.457
He was right outside
in the car.

07:13.491 --> 07:16.026
Katelyn told me,
so I went out
and introduced myself.

07:17.328 --> 07:19.629
Did you, uh,

07:19.664 --> 07:21.465
<i>actually read Ulysses,</i>

07:21.499 --> 07:23.700
or did you just read
the study guide?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.369
Did you actually graduate
from college in education,

07:26.404 --> 07:27.971
or did you just read
the study guide?

07:28.005 --> 07:29.239
You missed a few things.

07:29.273 --> 07:30.540
Maybe you missed a few things.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.343
Probably.
Do you speed read?

07:33.377 --> 07:34.544
No.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.513
I learned to speed read
when I was your age.

07:36.547 --> 07:39.649
Loved it.
Very useful skill to have.

07:39.684 --> 07:42.385
Well, looks okay.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.221
But I'll take the weekend

07:44.255 --> 07:46.923
to, uh, delve into this
a little more deeply,

07:46.958 --> 07:49.359
and look over your other work.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.663
Do that, because I spent
a lot of time doing that work.

07:53.698 --> 07:55.665
Tell me a little
about yourself.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.568
I'd like to get you connected
with some of the other kids
doing home schooling.

07:58.603 --> 08:02.205
Well, about myself,

08:02.240 --> 08:04.875
I don't care to be connected
with any of the other kids

08:04.909 --> 08:06.810
doing home schooling.

08:06.844 --> 08:10.580
I'm connecting you.
You need to be connected.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.716
You can't just hide over
at your house

08:12.750 --> 08:15.151
without any social interaction

08:15.186 --> 08:17.053
with any other student
on the planet.

08:17.088 --> 08:18.154
Why not?

08:18.189 --> 08:20.090
Because that's what
your dad said.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.492
And what he said goes.
He also said that.

08:22.527 --> 08:24.594
And he said for me
to tell you that,

08:24.629 --> 08:27.364
which I guess means
that he couldn't tell you.

08:27.398 --> 08:28.899
Guess he's
a little overwhelmed.

08:28.933 --> 08:31.234
Well, that's not my problem.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.503
[horn honks]

08:33.538 --> 08:35.005
I can't take it.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.907
I don't have another adult
to talk to.

08:36.941 --> 08:39.543
Donovan calls from the store--
it's the highlight of my day.

08:39.577 --> 08:41.378
I need another adult
to talk to, Anne.

08:41.412 --> 08:42.611
Been there, done that.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.314
Yeah, but at least you had
someone to talk to

08:44.348 --> 08:46.316
when I came home at night.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.251
Yeah, okay.
I wasn't that adult.

08:48.286 --> 08:49.586
I gotta make some friends.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.154
You have friends.

08:51.188 --> 08:53.223
Why don't you call Ruben,
do something with him?

08:53.257 --> 08:54.891
'Cause he's a big,
important prosecutor,

08:54.926 --> 08:57.327
and I'm just a house man.

08:57.361 --> 08:58.628
That's ridiculous.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.763
No, it's not.

08:59.797 --> 09:01.164
Do you have friends?
Who do you talk to?

09:01.198 --> 09:02.465
Mostly Eugene.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.167
Who's that?
Mimsy's husband.

09:04.201 --> 09:05.168
Oh.

09:05.202 --> 09:06.469
<i>I really enjoy
talking to him.</i>

09:06.504 --> 09:08.605
He is so smart.
I've learned so much

09:08.639 --> 09:10.307
about running the business
from talking to him.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.975
I've run a business.
You can talk to me.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.810
Yeah, but I have
adults to talk to.

09:15.313 --> 09:17.147
So where's our son
this morning?

09:17.181 --> 09:18.949
He's at daycare.
Why? You're home.

09:18.983 --> 09:22.218
I'm working.
Or I'm trying to work.
I have clients coming over.

09:22.253 --> 09:24.254
I have to go.
[beeps]

09:24.288 --> 09:26.122
[beeps]

09:26.157 --> 09:27.824
[engine starts]

09:27.858 --> 09:30.327
I do not want a friend.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.928
Well, you're gonna
get a friend.

09:31.963 --> 09:33.296
So am I.

09:38.769 --> 09:40.370
Oh. Ricky. Hi.

09:40.404 --> 09:43.106
I just went to your office,
but some foreign guy
was in there.

09:43.140 --> 09:45.175
"Foreign"?
Well, a guy who wasn't you.

09:45.209 --> 09:48.612
Malkovich. He's overseeing
home schooling students.

09:48.646 --> 09:50.447
We can kick him out.
Come on.

09:50.481 --> 09:52.515
He can't still be talking
to Ashley.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.784
What do you want?
Why can't you just tell me
what it is right here?

09:54.819 --> 09:56.720
It's nothing bad.
I just wanna make sure

09:56.754 --> 09:58.722
you get your
college applications in.

09:58.756 --> 10:00.490
I saw that you hadn't
applied anywhere.

10:00.524 --> 10:02.492
I know that
I'm not gonna apply anywhere.

10:02.526 --> 10:04.361
But you're graduating,

10:04.395 --> 10:06.763
and you have an extremely high
grade point average,

10:06.797 --> 10:09.265
and your SATs were outstanding.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.969
If you aren't going to college,
why did you take the SATs?

10:13.004 --> 10:15.071
Because there were girls there.
Smart girls.

10:15.106 --> 10:18.074
I like smart girls.
And these weren't just
girls from this school.

10:18.109 --> 10:21.344
They were from all over.
And that was before Amy
and I started dating.

10:21.379 --> 10:24.014
Whatever your purpose was,
it doesn't matter.

10:24.048 --> 10:25.582
Well, it matters.

10:25.616 --> 10:27.250
But you're bright,

10:27.284 --> 10:29.285
and you aced your test,

10:29.320 --> 10:31.287
and you could
get into college.

10:31.322 --> 10:34.691
Maybe even get
financial assistance
or a scholarship, so--

10:34.725 --> 10:36.559
So I'm not going.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.562
I'm gonna stay
at the butcher ship
and see where I get with that.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.265
Don't you think
studying business could
get you somewhere with that?

10:42.299 --> 10:43.433
No.

10:43.467 --> 10:45.769
Well, I would still
encourage you

10:45.803 --> 10:47.937
to apply
to a couple of schools

10:47.972 --> 10:49.673
just in case
you change your mind

10:49.707 --> 10:51.474
I've never thought
about going to college,

10:51.509 --> 10:53.243
so I'm not
gonna change my mind.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.245
I have nothing
to change my mind about.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.913
Amy wants to go to college.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.648
I'm gonna work
and help her with John.

10:58.683 --> 11:00.350
She can be the one
who goes to college.

11:00.384 --> 11:03.119
Well, sounds very couple-ish.

11:03.154 --> 11:05.055
So you did decide
to get married.

11:05.089 --> 11:06.990
No, I did not decide
to get married.

11:07.024 --> 11:09.059
I said, "We'll see."

11:13.698 --> 11:16.833
Well, look who's standing
out in the hallway
all by himself.

11:16.867 --> 11:19.269
You are so
[exhales forcefully]

11:19.303 --> 11:20.804
going to have a baby.

11:20.838 --> 11:23.306
[chuckles]
Yep.

11:23.340 --> 11:26.710
And soon I will be so married
and living with Ben.

11:26.744 --> 11:29.646
Yeah. Well, uh...

11:29.680 --> 11:30.880
You don't wanna get married.

11:30.915 --> 11:32.348
I don't know, Adrian.

11:32.383 --> 11:33.850
I just think I'm too young.

11:33.884 --> 11:36.319
You know, I'm too young,
Amy's too young,

11:36.353 --> 11:38.254
Ben's too young,
you're too young.

11:38.289 --> 11:40.490
We're all too young
to be getting married
and having babies.

11:40.524 --> 11:44.260
Oh, yeah. But, hey,
that's what is.

11:44.295 --> 11:46.196
We're having babies.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.498
Or we had babies, and...

11:48.532 --> 11:51.701
Well, it's nice if there's both
a mommy and a daddy
to raise a baby, so--

11:51.736 --> 11:54.571
So the mommy and daddy
don't have to be married.

11:54.605 --> 11:58.007
I mean, I'm doing everything
I can for John,
and I'm not married to Amy.

11:58.042 --> 12:01.311
I wouldn't do
anything more for him
if I were married to Amy.

12:01.345 --> 12:05.014
I care about her.
I really care about her
and about John,

12:05.049 --> 12:08.351
but...I don't get marriage.

12:08.385 --> 12:11.254
Making a lifetime commitment
at our age

12:11.288 --> 12:13.556
just seems kind of ridiculous.

12:13.591 --> 12:15.959
Yeah, I guess.

12:15.993 --> 12:18.361
But Ben and I
are getting married anyway.

12:18.395 --> 12:22.098
And so I guess you and Amy
are just gonna be friends?

12:22.133 --> 12:25.168
Amy and I
are not just friends.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.238
Oh. Well, that's not
what I heard.

12:28.272 --> 12:30.240
I heard she offered
to have sex with you,

12:30.274 --> 12:32.876
and you didn't wanna
have sex with her.

12:32.910 --> 12:35.512
So maybe you are
just friends.

12:48.053 --> 12:49.386
[door opens]

12:52.123 --> 12:54.358
Ashley, this is Toby,
your new study buddy.

12:54.392 --> 12:57.127
Toby, this is Ashley,
your new study buddy.

12:57.162 --> 12:59.396
Good-bye, and good luck.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.101
Is he always like that?

13:04.135 --> 13:06.103
So-- what's the word-- abrupt?

13:06.137 --> 13:07.771
I think he's going
with the

13:07.806 --> 13:09.740
"let's throw two feral cats
in a room together

13:09.774 --> 13:11.742
and see if they don't
kill each other" concept.

13:11.776 --> 13:13.377
You can leave if you want.

13:13.411 --> 13:16.046
No. I've already been through
a number of buddies.

13:16.081 --> 13:18.816
[British accent]
I think I'll take a seat,
if you don't mind.

13:18.850 --> 13:20.351
Suit yourself.

13:23.488 --> 13:25.656
Do you have a British accent?

13:25.690 --> 13:27.024
I was just gonna
ask you the same thing.

13:27.058 --> 13:28.459
No.
No.

13:28.493 --> 13:29.727
Not exactly.
Not exactly.

13:29.761 --> 13:31.295
[both chuckle]

13:31.329 --> 13:33.430
I'm just affecting an accent
to differentiate myself

13:33.465 --> 13:35.132
from the common people.
As am I.

13:35.166 --> 13:39.737
So, are you antisocial,

13:39.771 --> 13:41.972
druggy, seriously ill,

13:42.006 --> 13:44.475
genius, agoraphobic?

13:45.810 --> 13:47.611
How'd you get
into home schooling?

13:47.645 --> 13:48.946
I had a baby.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.814
Liar.

13:50.849 --> 13:52.516
I like that.

13:52.550 --> 13:54.518
Your sister's the one
who had the baby.

13:54.552 --> 13:56.653
Your dad gave me
a little family history
before he dumped me.

13:56.688 --> 13:58.922
Ask me more questions,
I'll tell you more lies.

13:58.957 --> 14:00.257
Ever had sex with a guy?

14:00.291 --> 14:01.492
No.

14:01.526 --> 14:03.494
Is that a lie?
No.

14:03.528 --> 14:05.229
Any girl-on-girl action?
No!

14:05.263 --> 14:06.830
Did I touch a nerve?
No.

14:06.865 --> 14:08.799
Do you wanna
ask me anything?

14:08.833 --> 14:10.834
Ever had sex with a guy?
No.

14:10.869 --> 14:13.237
Any boy-on-girl action?
No.

14:13.271 --> 14:14.938
Oh, so you're also a liar.

14:14.973 --> 14:16.640
Yeah.

14:17.876 --> 14:21.779
All right. Well, uh,

14:21.813 --> 14:23.981
do you wanna go
for a ride in my car?

14:24.015 --> 14:25.349
I have a very nice car.

14:27.919 --> 14:29.920
"Nice car" was a lie.

14:33.825 --> 14:34.825
[door opens]

14:39.998 --> 14:42.132
Field trip.

14:42.167 --> 14:43.600
You see that?

14:43.635 --> 14:45.302
It worked.

14:45.336 --> 14:46.904
Now I need a study buddy.

14:46.938 --> 14:48.906
And you know why?
Because you, my friend,

14:48.940 --> 14:51.542
are unable to draw
any attention to yourself
whenever we go for a walk.

14:54.512 --> 14:56.447
Oh!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:56.481 --> 14:58.482
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

14:58.516 --> 15:01.452
Are you okay?
I heard Ricky turned you down.

15:01.486 --> 15:03.287
Oh, no, he didn't.
He said, "We'll see."

15:03.321 --> 15:05.222
Oh, I meant sex.

15:05.256 --> 15:07.424
I wasn't talking
about the proposal.

15:07.459 --> 15:10.828
Or are you two going to see
about that, too-- the sex?

15:10.862 --> 15:14.298
Whether or not
Ricky and I have sex
is none of your business.

15:14.332 --> 15:16.800
And whether or not
Ricky and I get married
is none of your business.

15:16.835 --> 15:18.502
Maybe not.

15:18.536 --> 15:20.971
But he told me
he doesn't wanna get married
when he's in high school.

15:21.005 --> 15:22.506
Yeah, so?

15:22.540 --> 15:23.907
Then I guess
you're not getting married.

15:23.942 --> 15:25.642
Which brings me back to
it's none of your business.

15:25.677 --> 15:29.546
I seem to recall someone
calling me from New York,

15:29.581 --> 15:32.382
early on in my pregnancy,
offering to be my friend.

15:33.585 --> 15:35.853
So are we friends?
Of course.

15:35.887 --> 15:39.423
Then as your friend,
I'm gonna give you some
friendly advice about Ricky.

15:39.457 --> 15:41.658
'Cause you know him
so much better than I do.

15:41.693 --> 15:45.162
Yeah. At least I've known him
more often than you have.

15:45.196 --> 15:47.598
I think you've known him
more often than anyone has.

15:47.632 --> 15:49.233
Exactly.
I think you've known

15:49.267 --> 15:51.201
a lot of people
more often than anyone has.

15:51.236 --> 15:53.170
Mm-hmm. Including Ben.

15:53.204 --> 15:56.273
Look, but none of that
has anything to do
with any of this.

15:56.307 --> 15:59.510
If you want what I have,
then do what I'm gonna
tell you to do.

15:59.544 --> 16:01.612
Move in with Ricky.

16:01.646 --> 16:03.280
Look, it's not about
a piece of paper

16:03.314 --> 16:04.948
that says you own Ricky
or a house.

16:04.983 --> 16:06.450
It's about spending time
with each other

16:06.484 --> 16:08.252
and raising your son together.

16:08.286 --> 16:11.288
Ricky's not gonna have a wedding
or buy real estate.

16:11.322 --> 16:14.791
But I know he loves you
and he wants to be with you.

16:14.826 --> 16:17.227
So move in with Ricky.

16:17.262 --> 16:19.730
And don't ask him.
Just do it.

16:19.764 --> 16:21.965
Stay over one night,
and then never go home.

16:33.445 --> 16:35.012
[door opens]

16:38.817 --> 16:41.152
Hey, George.
My boyfriend's here.

16:41.186 --> 16:42.820
Your what?

16:42.854 --> 16:44.922
I thought...

16:44.956 --> 16:46.424
Bunny, right?

16:46.458 --> 16:47.858
We met at Leo's wedding.
George Juergens.

16:47.893 --> 16:50.861
Yeah. George. How are you?
What can we do for you?

16:50.896 --> 16:53.097
Thought I'd swing by
and see if I could take

16:53.131 --> 16:54.932
your newest employee
out for coffee.

16:54.966 --> 16:57.368
He thinks I'm hot.
Yeah, I do.

16:57.402 --> 17:00.271
Sorry, kids.
We don't have coffee breaks.

17:00.305 --> 17:02.540
Yeah. We only get
bathroom breaks.

17:02.574 --> 17:04.942
Yeah, probably too soon
in our relationship for that.

17:07.479 --> 17:09.480
I would've called,
but I don't have
your cell number.

17:09.513 --> 17:11.182
Uh, you mean
my cell phone number

17:11.215 --> 17:12.715
or the number of my cell,

17:12.751 --> 17:15.486
which was 323,
upper level, upper bunk.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.354
Watch it.
That stuff turns me on.

17:18.490 --> 17:21.392
Uh, why don't I
let you two chat?

17:23.494 --> 17:26.630
So, you wanna see me
use the meat cleaver?

17:26.665 --> 17:28.465
Ooh, baby.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.501
So, what time you get off work?

17:30.535 --> 17:33.370
Uh, when Ricky
and Ben get here.

17:33.405 --> 17:35.039
Stick around till 3:30,

17:35.073 --> 17:37.074
I'll wash
the blood off my hands,
and we'll be on our way.

17:37.109 --> 17:40.244
Sure. And, um, maybe
instead of coffee, we could--

17:40.278 --> 17:41.879
I don't know--
have dinner or something?

17:41.913 --> 17:43.047
Uh...

17:44.116 --> 17:47.151
if she wants
to have dinner with you.

17:47.185 --> 17:49.386
Well, I wanna have dinner
with him.

17:54.926 --> 17:56.393
Hello?

17:56.428 --> 17:58.429
Is anyone home?

17:59.698 --> 18:01.665
Good.
I'll just leave a note.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.701
All right.
Whatever you want.

18:04.870 --> 18:05.903
Oh.

18:05.937 --> 18:07.738
Hey, you two.

18:07.772 --> 18:09.273
What's going on?

18:09.307 --> 18:11.208
Oh. I thought
you weren't home.

18:11.243 --> 18:13.177
Oh. You disappointed,
'cause you thought

18:13.211 --> 18:15.179
it would be quiet
and you could get
your homework done?

18:15.213 --> 18:16.747
Not exactly.

18:16.781 --> 18:18.582
[Kathleen]
Jeff and I were just
taking a nap.

18:21.319 --> 18:22.953
I'm just gonna go
pack a few things,

18:22.988 --> 18:24.588
'cause I'm gonna
spend the night at Grant's.

18:28.393 --> 18:30.528
Oh, boy.

18:30.562 --> 18:32.897
Anyone want a sandwich?

18:32.931 --> 18:35.232
She's spending the night
at your house?

18:36.668 --> 18:38.936
Grace is spending
the night at your house?

18:40.305 --> 18:42.306
Who said Grace is spending
the night at your house?

18:42.340 --> 18:44.275
I think Grace did.

18:55.287 --> 18:57.254
Amy and Ricky
are moving in together,

18:57.289 --> 18:59.456
and Adrian and Ben
are looking at condos right now,

18:59.491 --> 19:02.059
because they're getting married
because they're having a baby.

19:02.093 --> 19:04.361
So in comparison,
I think spending the night

19:04.396 --> 19:05.963
at Grant's house
is nothing to be upset about.

19:05.997 --> 19:08.566
Yeah, if those were
your siblings
and not just your friends,

19:08.600 --> 19:10.734
that might count
for something, Grace.

19:10.769 --> 19:12.703
Are Grant's parents
gonna be home?

19:12.737 --> 19:14.171
No, they're not.

19:17.709 --> 19:20.611
Um, Mom, is your shirt on
inside out?

19:25.183 --> 19:26.450
Fine.

19:26.484 --> 19:28.385
I know the two of you
have spent the night here

19:28.420 --> 19:30.254
without having sex,

19:30.288 --> 19:33.257
so maybe you won't
have sex there.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.226
And by the way,
I'm married.

19:35.260 --> 19:36.560
All right?

19:37.796 --> 19:42.099
Which should not
encourage you to get married.

19:42.133 --> 19:44.535
Don't get married
just to have sex with someone,

19:44.569 --> 19:47.104
and don't have sex with someone
just to get them to marry you.

19:47.138 --> 19:48.339
Okay.

19:48.373 --> 19:50.007
And if you do have sex
in high school,

19:50.041 --> 19:51.809
just know that it's not likely
this is who

19:51.843 --> 19:53.510
you'll be having sex with
for the rest of your life.

19:53.545 --> 19:54.812
Okay.

19:54.846 --> 19:56.580
[sighs]

19:56.615 --> 19:59.984
Wait a second. Are...

20:00.018 --> 20:02.319
You're not afraid

20:02.354 --> 20:04.922
that if I have sex,
you're gonna die, too, are you?

20:09.060 --> 20:12.062
No, honey, I'm not.

20:13.498 --> 20:16.800
I-- I'm just afraid
that you're not ready

20:16.835 --> 20:18.802
and that you'll regret it.

20:18.837 --> 20:21.705
And once you do it,
you can't take it back.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.073
I know that.

20:23.108 --> 20:25.142
And I know that I'm ready.

20:25.176 --> 20:26.910
Which is not to say
that Grant and I

20:26.945 --> 20:29.079
are definitely gonna
have sex tonight.

20:29.114 --> 20:31.081
But we're thinking about it.

20:31.116 --> 20:33.150
But we've been thinking
about it. You know.

20:33.184 --> 20:35.085
Yeah, I know that.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.521
And thank you for talking
to me about it.

20:37.555 --> 20:40.591
I mean, I'm really happy
the way we've been talking--

20:40.625 --> 20:42.226
you and me and Grant.

20:43.895 --> 20:46.363
So,

20:46.398 --> 20:49.300
I guess it really is
your decision.

20:49.334 --> 20:52.136
And if you do decide
to do something,
I want you to be careful.

20:52.170 --> 20:54.972
I mean,
I know you're on birth control,
but please use condoms.

20:55.006 --> 20:57.841
Okay? Promise?

20:58.843 --> 21:00.678
I promise.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.081
Okay.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.750
Bye.

21:36.548 --> 21:38.515
What the heck?
Let's just do it already.

21:38.550 --> 21:40.617
I can't. I have a game
in, like, two hours.

21:40.652 --> 21:42.186
Yeah. And?

21:43.455 --> 21:45.289
It's just not a good time.
I don't get it.

21:45.323 --> 21:47.891
I thought you wanted,
like, a hotel and romance

21:47.926 --> 21:49.360
and flowers
and all that stuff.

21:49.394 --> 21:51.929
Well, yeah, I did.
But...I don't.

21:51.963 --> 21:53.964
I wanna be spontaneous.

21:56.501 --> 21:58.736
I can't. I can't.
Yeah, you can.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.304
I don't have a condom.
I have condoms.

22:00.338 --> 22:03.607
But you're not on the pill.
Well, no,
but I have condoms.

22:03.641 --> 22:05.876
Just be careful.
I'd rather you be on the pill.

22:05.910 --> 22:07.811
Okay.
[chuckles]

22:07.846 --> 22:10.047
Are you, like, actually
turning me down for sex?

22:10.081 --> 22:11.615
I guess I am.

22:11.649 --> 22:14.918
Oh, and this is all because
of some stupid football game?

22:14.953 --> 22:18.021
It's not some stupid
football game.
Every game counts.

22:18.056 --> 22:20.424
That guy from Arizona's
gonna be there tonight.
The scout.

22:20.458 --> 22:21.959
He was at your last game.

22:21.993 --> 22:24.561
Oh, well, then from
some other state.

22:24.596 --> 22:26.063
You know,
you're not a good liar.

22:26.097 --> 22:28.165
If you don't wanna
have sex with me,
just say it.

22:28.199 --> 22:30.467
I don't wanna
have sex with you.
Why?

22:30.502 --> 22:32.403
Because I don't want you
to get any ideas

22:32.437 --> 22:35.406
about us getting married
or buying a place together
or something.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.574
Oh, so it's because
we'd never get married

22:37.609 --> 22:39.076
or get a place together
or something?

22:39.110 --> 22:41.378
I don't know.
I can't know that right now.

22:41.413 --> 22:44.415
But I do know that if we do it,
you're gonna want
some kind of commitment.

22:44.449 --> 22:45.916
Yeah. Well, you know,

22:45.950 --> 22:48.619
I-- I would want some kind
of commitment, but...

22:48.653 --> 22:50.721
I don't know. It, like...

22:50.755 --> 22:53.290
It doesn't have to be
a lifetime commitment.

22:53.324 --> 22:55.292
You know,
maybe you could just...

22:55.326 --> 22:57.294
We could just promise
that, like,

22:57.328 --> 22:59.930
we would only have sex
with each other, you know,
while we're having sex.

22:59.964 --> 23:01.932
I mean, maybe that's a promise
that we could make.

23:01.966 --> 23:03.434
We'll see.
[scoffs]

23:03.468 --> 23:05.202
Who do you think you are?
Ricky?

23:05.236 --> 23:07.004
There's no "we'll see"
in this relationship.

23:07.038 --> 23:09.106
How about
"I'll think about it"?

23:17.949 --> 23:20.117
Ring! Ring, damn it!

23:20.151 --> 23:21.785
[ringing]

23:21.820 --> 23:22.953
[beeps]

23:22.987 --> 23:25.322
Hello. This is Lauren.

23:31.830 --> 23:34.131
[sighs]
There you go, John.

23:34.165 --> 23:35.632
[grunts]

23:37.602 --> 23:39.102
[beeping]

23:40.138 --> 23:42.139
[ringing]

23:45.410 --> 23:47.311
[beeps]
Hey, Amy.

23:47.345 --> 23:50.481
Look, I really appreciate
that you talked to me today.

23:50.515 --> 23:52.382
I don't know.
Maybe you're right.

23:52.417 --> 23:55.519
It would be a pretty bold move
to just force myself
into Ricky's apartment,

23:55.553 --> 23:57.020
but I might give it a try.

23:57.055 --> 23:58.021
Yeah?

23:58.056 --> 24:00.224
Yeah. But, anyway,

24:00.258 --> 24:02.459
since you offered me
your help and advice today,

24:02.494 --> 24:04.428
if you come over here,
I'd like to return the favor.

24:04.462 --> 24:06.430
What, by telling me something
I don't know about Ben?

24:06.464 --> 24:07.831
Yep.

24:07.866 --> 24:10.300
You wanna know how
to get him out of his house,
don't you?

24:10.335 --> 24:12.269
[beeps]

24:14.005 --> 24:15.339
[beeps]

24:21.824 --> 24:23.191
Hey.

24:24.893 --> 24:27.895
Hey, boss.
Another night of house hunting?

24:27.930 --> 24:29.831
[sighs]
I guess.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.601
Where is he?

24:33.635 --> 24:35.436
Ben? Oh,
he went up to Ricky's.

24:35.470 --> 24:38.105
Wanted to get a shower
before he goes out
with the bride.

24:38.140 --> 24:40.875
Ricky's mother around?
No. She leaves
when they come in.

24:40.909 --> 24:42.310
Amy?
Uh-uh.

24:42.344 --> 24:44.579
She's coming by later
to drop off the little guy,

24:44.613 --> 24:46.647
but it's not a date.

24:46.682 --> 24:48.649
What's going on?

24:48.684 --> 24:51.485
Got a call from
the school counselor today.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.988
She wants me to talk to Ricky
about going to college.

24:54.022 --> 24:56.324
He never mentioned college.

24:56.358 --> 24:59.126
I think his secret dream
is to take over the shop here.

24:59.161 --> 25:01.062
Yeah. She thinks so, too.

25:01.096 --> 25:02.597
But, uh, you went
to college, right?

25:02.631 --> 25:03.831
And?

25:03.866 --> 25:05.733
Hi, Mr. Boykewich.

25:05.767 --> 25:07.101
Ricky, how are you?

25:07.135 --> 25:10.238
I'm good. Why?
You heard Amy proposed to me?

25:10.272 --> 25:12.406
Proposed several things.
[chuckles]

25:14.810 --> 25:16.477
Okay. Good night.

25:20.382 --> 25:21.415
I did hear.

25:21.450 --> 25:23.150
I don't know
what she was thinking.

25:23.185 --> 25:24.819
That she'd like
to get married?

25:24.853 --> 25:27.622
Oh, no. You're not here
to tell me to marry her,
are you?

25:27.656 --> 25:30.157
No, no. That's totally
up to you and Amy.

25:30.192 --> 25:32.026
That's not what you said
about Adrian.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.761
Well, you're my son.

25:35.564 --> 25:38.633
Uh, okay.
Well, I guess we're off.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.001
Did you wanna
tell me something?

25:40.035 --> 25:41.769
We'll talk some other time.

25:41.803 --> 25:43.638
All right.
Did I do something?

25:43.672 --> 25:45.539
No, no.
You didn't do anything.

25:45.574 --> 25:47.608
I just haven't talked
to you in a while.

25:47.643 --> 25:49.944
Should I wait
in the car?

25:49.978 --> 25:52.680
Oh, no.
We gotta get going.

25:52.714 --> 25:54.215
Good night, Ricky.

25:54.249 --> 25:56.584
Yeah. Good night.

26:07.429 --> 26:09.163
[Amy]
Um, wait.

26:09.197 --> 26:11.198
Hold-- Hold on a minute.

26:13.235 --> 26:15.069
Toby. I'm the new
study buddy.

26:15.103 --> 26:16.570
Oh. All right.

26:16.605 --> 26:18.572
Well, uh,
my dad's not around,

26:18.607 --> 26:20.374
and I have to go, so--
We figured.

26:20.409 --> 26:22.710
Does my dad know
that you're with Ashley?
He does.

26:22.744 --> 26:24.645
Okay. Well--

26:24.680 --> 26:28.249
It's cool.
We've been pre-approved by
the Board of Education for co--

26:28.283 --> 26:30.484
Mingling?
I wish.

26:34.790 --> 26:37.024
Is that your spawn there?

26:38.961 --> 26:41.595
I was just trying to impress you
with my lack of social skills

26:41.630 --> 26:44.198
so that you might find me
appropriate company
for the dark one.

26:44.232 --> 26:46.200
You might just be perfect.

26:46.234 --> 26:49.203
Yeah. Who can ever tell
who's supposed to be with whom?

26:49.237 --> 26:51.005
Yeah. Right.

26:51.039 --> 26:52.907
Well, have a nice evening.

26:52.941 --> 26:54.775
Okay. Yeah.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.477
Totally.

26:58.113 --> 26:59.780
[door closes]

27:05.354 --> 27:07.688
Follow.
[barks]

27:11.626 --> 27:13.928
Just one more minute.
We're going.

27:17.265 --> 27:19.066
[beeping]

27:20.235 --> 27:22.236
[phone ringing]

27:23.638 --> 27:25.239
I'm sorry.

27:25.273 --> 27:26.907
Hi. Guess where I am.

27:26.942 --> 27:30.444
Not here. And Ashley
and her new study buddy
just got here.

27:30.479 --> 27:33.914
Oh, rats. All right.
I'll head that way, shortly.

27:33.949 --> 27:36.584
I'm going over to Ricky's.
I'll call you lar.

27:36.618 --> 27:38.853
Oh, I didn't guess
where you are.
You wanna tell me?

27:38.887 --> 27:40.354
Out with
your future mother-in-law.

27:40.389 --> 27:42.023
Who?
Nora.

27:42.057 --> 27:44.258
We're getting
a bite to eat at Jeff's.
It's a date.

27:45.427 --> 27:47.661
O-kay.
Don't worry about Ashley.

27:47.696 --> 27:50.431
She'll be fine. The counselor
and the teacher know this kid,
and I talked to his parents.

27:50.465 --> 27:53.300
All right. Well, uh,
enjoy your dinner.

27:53.335 --> 27:54.301
Okay. Bye.

27:54.336 --> 27:56.037
Just the kids
checking on me.

27:56.071 --> 27:57.438
Oh, that's sweet.

27:57.472 --> 27:59.173
So, where were we?

27:59.207 --> 28:01.208
You think Ricky and Amy
will get married?

28:02.244 --> 28:03.577
I don't know.

28:03.612 --> 28:05.046
You want them
to get married?

28:05.080 --> 28:06.447
Sure, if it means
we can hang out more.

28:06.481 --> 28:08.616
[chuckles]
Oh, George.

28:08.650 --> 28:10.618
I love hanging out
with you, too,

28:10.652 --> 28:12.653
but there's something
I've really gotta tell you.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.289
Oh, my God.

28:15.323 --> 28:17.625
That's Adrian's dad,
Ruben.

28:17.659 --> 28:18.926
He's not with his wife.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.328
Ow. Somebody's
gonna get in trouble.

28:30.105 --> 28:31.906
What are you
doing here? Hi.

28:31.940 --> 28:34.475
Nothing. Just grabbing
a bite after work.

28:34.509 --> 28:35.810
What are you doing here?

28:35.844 --> 28:37.244
Business.
We're working on a case.

28:37.279 --> 28:38.746
[Nora]
Ah.

28:38.780 --> 28:39.947
Mmm.

28:39.981 --> 28:41.882
Mmm.

28:44.586 --> 28:45.920
[chuckles]

28:47.689 --> 28:50.958
[together]
I'd like you to meet
my girlfriend.

28:52.494 --> 28:54.895
George, this is Ollie.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.598
Ollie, this is George.
Uh, Ricky's girlfriend's dad.

28:57.632 --> 28:59.567
Oh, George.
I've heard a lot about you.

29:00.936 --> 29:02.670
I was going to tell you.

29:02.704 --> 29:04.338
My God,

29:04.372 --> 29:06.107
I almost slept
with a lesbian.

29:06.141 --> 29:07.608
No, you didn't.

29:07.642 --> 29:10.411
Honey, this is Ruben.
Ruben is the guy--

29:10.445 --> 29:12.113
Who got me out. Ruben!
Yes.

29:12.147 --> 29:13.948
Oh, God, you're cute.
I love you.
[chuckling]

29:13.982 --> 29:15.583
How can I ever
thank you enough?

29:15.617 --> 29:17.651
Well, I just set things
in motion.

29:17.686 --> 29:19.153
Really, I didn't do anything.

29:19.187 --> 29:21.155
Besides, Ollie here
owes me dinner.

29:21.189 --> 29:22.756
She just beat me up in court.

29:22.791 --> 29:25.092
Oh, no. You know what?
I just got my first paycheck.

29:25.127 --> 29:27.061
I'm going to buy
everyone dinner here.

29:27.095 --> 29:29.063
No, Nora.
That's really sweet,
honey, but--

29:29.097 --> 29:30.531
No, but nothing.
I'm gonna do it.

29:30.565 --> 29:32.066
Come on.

29:36.571 --> 29:38.172
Yes, I knew
they were dating.

29:38.206 --> 29:39.874
I didn't know
you two were dating.

29:42.978 --> 29:44.945
We'll all
just have the soup.

29:44.980 --> 29:47.681
Yeah. Soup.
Yeah.

29:49.151 --> 29:50.718
[Nora]
Mmm.

29:53.488 --> 29:56.357
And you don't know
what the utilities are?

29:56.391 --> 29:58.692
No one's actually
lived here yet.

29:58.727 --> 30:00.694
The owners partially
furnished the place,

30:00.729 --> 30:02.496
and in the process
got into an argument,

30:02.531 --> 30:04.798
and split up before
ever taking possession.

30:04.833 --> 30:06.867
Aw, jeez. You should've
told us that first.

30:06.902 --> 30:09.270
This place has bad Karma
written all over it.

30:09.304 --> 30:11.639
I'm sure their Karma
followed them

30:11.673 --> 30:13.574
to their own
separate apartments, and...

30:13.608 --> 30:15.576
Come on, Ben.

30:15.610 --> 30:17.811
Adrian likes it.

30:17.846 --> 30:19.547
Your dad thinks
it's a good investment.

30:21.016 --> 30:22.349
Then we should just buy it?

30:22.384 --> 30:25.686
You're not buying anything.
I am.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.189
What the heck
is wrong with you?

30:28.223 --> 30:29.924
You made a checklist.

30:29.958 --> 30:32.359
This has everything
on your checklist.

30:32.394 --> 30:34.061
Yeah. Two bedrooms,
two bathrooms,

30:34.095 --> 30:37.331
black and white tile,
separate laundry
off the kitchen,

30:37.365 --> 30:39.767
electric stove,
white appliances,

30:39.801 --> 30:42.403
an outdoor space,
hardwood floors,

30:42.437 --> 30:44.004
et cetera, et cetera,

30:44.039 --> 30:46.407
and it is in
your price range.

30:46.441 --> 30:47.908
Is the paint zero VOC?

30:49.211 --> 30:50.444
Yes.

30:50.478 --> 30:52.947
Who the hell are you?

30:52.981 --> 30:55.249
This place is perfect
for the two of you.

30:55.283 --> 30:57.318
Could Ben and I
just hang out in here

30:57.352 --> 30:58.986
for, like,
a half hour or so?

30:59.020 --> 31:00.754
You know, kind of get
a feel for the place.

31:00.789 --> 31:02.923
I don't think
we need to do that.
Do that.

31:02.958 --> 31:04.391
I'll have Mike drop me off,

31:04.426 --> 31:06.860
and then he'll swing back by
and pick up the two of you.

31:06.895 --> 31:08.862
Can you close the door?
It locks automatically.

31:08.897 --> 31:12.266
Which means we could easily
lock ourselves out
and leave the baby inside.

31:12.300 --> 31:15.603
It's the temporary lock
so Realtors can show the condo.

31:16.838 --> 31:18.606
Good night.

31:25.580 --> 31:27.948
I know what you're gonna say--
that you love the place.

31:27.983 --> 31:29.483
But you've loved every place
we've seen,

31:29.517 --> 31:32.052
and I really just think
we have to keep looking.

31:34.522 --> 31:36.156
I do love it.

31:36.191 --> 31:37.925
I really do. I--

31:37.959 --> 31:41.128
I love the kitchen
and the location.

31:41.162 --> 31:44.531
But, mostly, Ben,
I love you.

31:44.566 --> 31:46.433
I love you, too, Adrian.

31:46.468 --> 31:49.136
Is there some reason
why you don't wanna leave home?

31:49.170 --> 31:51.538
I mean, are you afraid
that you and I can't handle

31:51.573 --> 31:53.607
raising a baby on our own?

31:53.642 --> 31:55.809
Because, Ben, we're still
gonna have plenty of help

31:55.844 --> 31:58.145
from our parents
and our friends, and...

31:58.179 --> 32:00.681
Well, I think
we're gonna be fine.

32:00.715 --> 32:02.683
I mean,
it's going to be crazy,

32:02.717 --> 32:04.985
but it's gonna be crazy
in a good way.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.320
You know,
we're very lucky.

32:06.354 --> 32:08.822
I know. I just...

32:08.857 --> 32:11.659
I don't think
that this is the place.

32:13.461 --> 32:16.263
Well, are you going to think
that any place

32:16.298 --> 32:19.333
is the right place
besides your own home?

32:20.568 --> 32:24.605
Okay. Your mom died
at that house.

32:24.639 --> 32:26.640
And you and your mom
and your dad

32:26.675 --> 32:28.575
were happy
in that house, and--

32:28.610 --> 32:30.144
Well, I'm sure
you always pictured yourself

32:30.178 --> 32:31.779
growing up at that house
and never leaving.

32:33.214 --> 32:35.516
But if you think about it,

32:35.550 --> 32:37.751
you were going to leave it.

32:37.786 --> 32:39.753
I mean, you were probably
gonna leave it next year

32:39.788 --> 32:43.057
after you graduated
from high school
and went to college.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.391
But I'd go back.

32:44.426 --> 32:45.893
Yeah, you would.

32:45.927 --> 32:47.828
I'm sure you'll always
go back to that house.

32:47.862 --> 32:49.863
It's like your safety zone

32:49.898 --> 32:51.665
where you can
hang on to things

32:51.700 --> 32:53.667
the way they were
supposed to be.

32:53.702 --> 32:55.703
The way things were
when your mom was there.

32:57.172 --> 32:59.606
I'm sure you have
some really wonderful memories

32:59.641 --> 33:02.176
of the three of you
in that house.

33:02.210 --> 33:04.144
Ben, those memories

33:04.179 --> 33:06.080
are gonna be with you
wherever you go.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.848
Even if the house went away,

33:07.882 --> 33:10.751
the memories
would still be with you.

33:10.785 --> 33:13.253
You can't hold
the memories in your hand.

33:13.288 --> 33:17.358
But those memories
are the real part of life,

33:17.392 --> 33:18.859
not the house.

33:18.893 --> 33:21.161
I always knew that you
were smarter than I am.

33:21.196 --> 33:22.863
Maybe just older and wiser.

33:22.897 --> 33:25.432
Just a year older
and a year wiser,

33:25.467 --> 33:28.268
but I'll catch up to you.

33:28.303 --> 33:29.803
Promise.

33:40.715 --> 33:41.682
[knocks]

33:41.716 --> 33:43.217
[Amy]
We're here.

33:49.224 --> 33:51.692
Hey, buddy.

33:51.726 --> 33:53.093
Thanks for bringing him.

33:53.128 --> 33:55.796
Yeah. I was happy to.

33:56.865 --> 33:58.832
I made you some dinner.

33:58.867 --> 34:01.201
If you don't want it tonight,
you can save it for tomorrow.

34:01.236 --> 34:03.303
It's just pasta and a salad.
What kind of pasta?

34:03.338 --> 34:05.472
Just spaghetti and meat sauce.

34:05.507 --> 34:08.708
So you boys have a great time.
I'll see you Sunday, John.

34:09.911 --> 34:12.045
You made me spaghetti
and meat sauce?

34:12.080 --> 34:14.047
You think you're gonna bribe me
with my favorite meal?

34:14.081 --> 34:16.116
Oh, I forgot it was
your favorite meal.

34:16.150 --> 34:17.684
It was just
the easiest thing to make.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.853
And since my dad wasn't home,
I thought I would make dinner.

34:19.888 --> 34:21.321
Uh-huh. Go on.

34:21.356 --> 34:26.025
As it turns out,
he thinks he's on a date
with your mom.

34:26.060 --> 34:29.295
Yeah. And Ashley and her friend
are doing their own thing.

34:29.330 --> 34:31.264
So there you go.
Spaghetti and meat sauce.

34:31.299 --> 34:33.233
Wait. Ashley has a friend?
New study buddy.

34:35.469 --> 34:38.071
So, I'll be going now.
Did you eat?

34:38.106 --> 34:40.674
No. That's okay.
I saved some of that
for myself at home. I'm fine.

34:40.708 --> 34:42.543
You're not going
to the football game
with Madison and Lauren?

34:42.577 --> 34:46.013
No. I'm just gonna have dinner
and have some time to myself.
It'll be nice.

34:46.047 --> 34:49.283
All right. Well,
you're welcome to come in
and eat, if you want.

34:49.317 --> 34:51.851
I haven't eaten.
No. It's okay.

34:51.886 --> 34:55.054
I think I may have
overstepped the boundaries
when I was here last weekend.

34:55.089 --> 34:56.623
Yeah, maybe.

34:56.658 --> 34:59.293
So I withdraw
my proposal of marriage.

35:00.628 --> 35:03.230
But I'm still open to having sex
when the time is right.

35:03.264 --> 35:05.866
Just come on in.
We'll have some dinner together.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.001
Okay. But after that,

35:08.036 --> 35:10.904
I'm leaving so you can have
your time with John.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.164
So?

35:25.198 --> 35:26.432
So?

35:26.466 --> 35:28.701
So come on.
What do you think?

35:28.735 --> 35:32.004
About the pizza?
Pizza's great.

35:34.874 --> 35:37.910
Okay, I--
I do have one regret.

35:37.944 --> 35:40.512
And what's that?
I regret that we wasted

35:40.547 --> 35:42.648
the whole summer
not having sex.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.217
Oh, good.
So you liked it.

35:45.252 --> 35:47.419
I liked it.

35:47.454 --> 35:49.355
I really liked it.

35:49.389 --> 35:50.990
I just wish
we'd done it sooner.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.925
Nah, I think it's good
we waited the three months.

35:52.959 --> 35:54.226
Four months.

35:54.261 --> 35:55.594
Whatever.

35:55.629 --> 35:57.730
It seemed like an eternity.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.865
But at this point,
we knew each other well enough

35:59.899 --> 36:02.001
that we were both
totally comfortable.

36:02.035 --> 36:04.903
Weren't we?
We were.

36:04.938 --> 36:08.107
Although I was a bit more
than comfortable.

36:08.141 --> 36:10.042
Yeah, you were.

36:10.076 --> 36:13.279
You know, I know we're just
juniors in high school,

36:13.313 --> 36:16.181
and this probably
isn't gonna last forever,

36:16.216 --> 36:18.751
but right now, right--

36:18.785 --> 36:20.819
right in this moment,

36:20.854 --> 36:22.788
I'm really happy.

36:22.822 --> 36:24.189
Me, too.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.992
[chuckles]

36:27.027 --> 36:29.228
I hope this won't
destroy your happiness,

36:29.262 --> 36:31.530
but I just have to say it.

36:32.932 --> 36:34.867
I love you, Grace.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.702
You sure?

36:36.736 --> 36:37.970
Yeah.

36:38.004 --> 36:41.740
Good. I love you, too.

36:44.678 --> 36:46.812
I love this feeling.
I love it.

36:46.846 --> 36:50.449
I love being with you.
I love having a boyfriend.

36:50.483 --> 36:52.251
I love having sex.

36:54.888 --> 36:57.723
Well, let's make
a promise to each other.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.394
If either one of us
doesn't feel this way--

37:02.429 --> 37:04.930
you know,
if we fall out of love--

37:05.865 --> 37:08.400
let's be really nice about it,

37:09.703 --> 37:13.272
because to lose this
would be really painful.

37:18.678 --> 37:20.879
I don't wanna worry
about that right now.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.683
But I completely agree.

37:24.718 --> 37:26.285
And who knows?

37:26.319 --> 37:27.886
Maybe it will work out.

37:27.921 --> 37:30.189
Maybe we'll be that couple
that meets in high school

37:30.223 --> 37:32.191
and stays together
through college

37:32.225 --> 37:35.060
and gets married
and has children
and grandchildren.

37:35.095 --> 37:36.862
I didn't know
guys thought like that.

37:36.896 --> 37:38.664
I was also thinking
about doing it again.

37:38.698 --> 37:41.600
[chuckles]
Me, too.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.435
I didn't know
girls thought like that.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.770
Yeah.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.305
[chuckles]

37:46.339 --> 37:49.708
[Madison]
Yeah, so, we're just gonna
wait a little longer.

37:49.743 --> 37:52.745
You know, and Jack's just
gonna have to go without sex.

37:52.779 --> 37:54.613
He can go without sex.
So can I.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.181
So can I.

37:56.216 --> 37:58.650
And in another year,
we'll be looking at colleges

37:58.685 --> 38:00.919
and deciding
where we wanna go

38:00.954 --> 38:02.988
and what we wanna
major in.

38:03.022 --> 38:05.691
As much as I hate him
for breaking up with me,

38:05.725 --> 38:07.693
I think Jesse
did the right thing.

38:07.727 --> 38:09.661
Yeah, I guess.

38:09.696 --> 38:12.231
I-- I kind of felt like
you guys really liked
each other, though.

38:12.265 --> 38:13.932
Yeah.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.271
Hey, Madison.

38:19.305 --> 38:20.305
Hey.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.474
Hey, Lauren.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.009
Hey, Jesse.

38:24.043 --> 38:25.444
How are you?

38:25.478 --> 38:27.813
I'm good. You?

38:27.847 --> 38:29.148
Good.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.384
Good night.

38:32.419 --> 38:34.420
Hey. Sorry that
took so long.

38:34.454 --> 38:36.121
No problem.

38:36.156 --> 38:38.590
Let's go eat.
I'm starving.
Okay.

38:49.202 --> 38:50.335
[door opens]

38:53.640 --> 38:55.674
That guy better not be here
at this time of night.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.843
What time of night?
Bedtime at night.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.645
He's not.

38:59.679 --> 39:01.313
Was that a...

39:01.347 --> 39:02.781
It's late.
You're seeing things.

39:02.816 --> 39:04.683
It's not that late.
What'd you do tonight?

39:04.717 --> 39:06.018
I had a date
with Ricky's mother.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.187
Oh? The married one
or the gay one?

39:08.221 --> 39:09.588
Did everyone know but me?

39:09.622 --> 39:12.124
I think so.
Good night.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.471
Ahh!
[phone beeping]

39:26.339 --> 39:27.272
<i>[line ringing]</i>

39:27.307 --> 39:28.340
<i>[Anne]
Hey.</i>

39:28.374 --> 39:30.075
I thought you might call.
Why is that?

39:30.109 --> 39:32.311
Have you talked to Amy?
No, not for hours. Why?

39:32.345 --> 39:34.379
So she hasn't
told you anything?

39:34.414 --> 39:36.548
No. She didn't even tell me
that Ricky's mom is gay.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.417
Yeah, she is.
Did everyone know but me?

39:38.451 --> 39:40.085
[chuckling]
Probably.

39:40.119 --> 39:42.221
[sighs]
So what's going on with Amy?
What now?

39:42.255 --> 39:43.989
What comes after
a ridiculous marriage proposal

39:44.023 --> 39:46.124
and trying to seduce
the father of her baby
in front of me?

39:46.159 --> 39:49.061
She wants to move in with him.
She wants to live with Ricky,
not married.

39:49.095 --> 39:52.097
What the hell?
She's not gonna do that.
I do not want her doing that.

39:52.131 --> 39:54.633
What is wrong with these people?
Getting married
and having babies

39:54.667 --> 39:56.535
and living with each other
and acting like total idiots.

39:56.569 --> 39:57.569
Jealous?

39:57.604 --> 39:59.605
Maybe.
But that doesn't mean my Amy

39:59.639 --> 40:01.240
is moving in with that--
that-- that--

40:01.274 --> 40:03.175
Father of her baby?

40:03.209 --> 40:04.877
I think it might be okay.

40:04.911 --> 40:06.645
I think it might
be good for them.

40:06.679 --> 40:08.647
You know, maybe by the time
she gets out of high school,

40:08.681 --> 40:10.716
she'll realize that
she doesn't wanna be married,

40:10.750 --> 40:12.551
and she'll choose
what college she goes to

40:12.585 --> 40:13.952
based on what's best
for her future

40:13.987 --> 40:15.420
and not what's closest
to the butcher shop.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.022
Anne, we are not
gonna let her do that.

40:17.056 --> 40:19.458
I don't really think
that we can stop her
from doing that,

40:19.492 --> 40:21.460
if that's what she wants to do,
and I'd rather not try.

40:21.494 --> 40:23.328
I'm supposed to just sit here
and let that happen?

40:23.363 --> 40:25.330
No. You're supposed
to get back out there

40:25.365 --> 40:27.566
and get a life,
and so am I.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.535
[sighs]

40:34.007 --> 40:37.409
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

40:38.411 --> 40:40.546
You wanna stay over?
[chuckles]

40:40.580 --> 40:43.215
I wanna stay over
for the rest of our lives,

40:43.249 --> 40:45.851
but I know
you don't want that,

40:45.885 --> 40:48.954
so I better get up
and go home.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.956
It's late.
You don't have to go.

40:50.990 --> 40:54.660
I wouldn't want you to feel
like I'm moving in or anything.

40:54.694 --> 40:57.796
Amy, I'd be okay with that--
with you and me living together.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.198
I'm just not okay
with getting married.

41:00.233 --> 41:01.833
You'd be okay with that?

41:01.868 --> 41:04.069
Oh. Oh, now I get it.

41:04.103 --> 41:06.538
This is what you wanted
all along tonight.

41:06.573 --> 41:08.974
Now you don't wanna get married.
You wanna live together.

41:09.008 --> 41:10.742
Yeah, I do.

41:10.777 --> 41:12.744
I mean, if you don't
wanna get married now,

41:12.779 --> 41:15.314
you're probably never
gonna wanna get married.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.749
I'm fine with that.

41:17.784 --> 41:19.651
I just wanna be with you.

41:19.686 --> 41:22.654
Yeah, well,
no matter what we want,

41:22.689 --> 41:24.856
I don't think your parents
would ever let us live together.

41:24.891 --> 41:26.758
No. They will.

41:26.793 --> 41:29.461
I already talked
to my mother about it,
and she said okay.

41:29.495 --> 41:32.464
She's gonna talk to my dad.
And we can talk to my dad.

41:32.498 --> 41:34.933
We'll see.

41:34.968 --> 41:37.336
I'm kidding.
[chuckles]

41:37.370 --> 41:40.606
So you want me
to move in here?

41:40.640 --> 41:43.275
Yeah. But not right away.

41:43.309 --> 41:45.310
Give me some time
to talk to Mr. Boykewich

41:45.345 --> 41:47.646
and make sure it's okay
with him, all right?

41:47.680 --> 41:49.615
How much time?

41:49.649 --> 41:51.016
A week.

41:52.919 --> 41:55.754
Okay. I'm sure
he won't object.

41:55.788 --> 41:57.789
He's buying a condo
for Ben and Adrian

41:57.824 --> 41:59.257
so they can live together.

41:59.292 --> 42:01.059
But they're getting married.

42:01.094 --> 42:03.462
And if he wants us
to get married
before we live together--

42:03.496 --> 42:04.796
Then I'll say no,

42:04.831 --> 42:07.265
or we won't
live together.

42:07.300 --> 42:09.735
Okay.

42:09.769 --> 42:11.470
And sex?

42:12.338 --> 42:13.939
We'll see.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.675
[chuckles]
