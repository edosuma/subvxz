00:00.900 --> 00:02.060
<i>Previously on “Boston Legal”…</i>

00:02.100 --> 00:04.695
I was referred to
a sex therapist, a surrogate.

00:04.735 --> 00:05.960
I'd like you to meet with her.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm retired. I've remarried,
and my husband has problems

00:10.035 --> 00:12.060
with his wife being
a sexual surrogate.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.795
I-I'm sure you have a name,
but I'm not much interested.

00:14.835 --> 00:16.865
You scare me.
See me shudder?

00:16.900 --> 00:19.545
Take your clothes off.
I'll make you shudder.

00:19.585 --> 00:22.160
Do you think you could
maybe squeeze me in?

00:22.200 --> 00:24.795
I'm very sorry, but you
won't be making partner.

00:24.835 --> 00:27.360
Jerry Espenson deserves
to be made a partner.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.100
He's not a rainmaker, Alan.
He's toast, weird toast.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.795
Let me tell you something,
and you heard it here first.

00:43.835 --> 00:44.500
Okay.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.365
Obama's trouble with women…

00:48.400 --> 00:50.495
has nothing to do
with the Hillary supporters,

00:50.535 --> 00:52.760
most of whom are lesbians,
by the way,

00:52.800 --> 00:53.895
and you can quote me on that.

00:53.935 --> 00:55.265
I think I won't.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.265
–It comes from Bill.
–Bill?

00:57.300 --> 00:59.160
See, he's been with
a lot of women.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.500
Left most of them with
a bad taste in their mouth.

01:07.900 --> 01:08.900
So, uh, Jerry,

01:09.600 --> 01:10.460
you and I are having a drink.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.160
What's the deal?
'Cause I think you're weird.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
Okay.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.295
I come up for partner
this fall, Mr Crane.

01:18.335 --> 01:19.860
Call me Denny. No, don't.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.700
And when I do…
I expect your full support.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.600
Why would I want
a weird guy for a partner?

01:28.300 --> 01:30.000
Because I've earned it.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.036
And to get it,
I'm going to need your support.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.595
Here's my question to you…
do you really want it?

01:37.635 --> 01:38.565
Yes, I do.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.800
Cause being a partner
in a law firm

01:41.835 --> 01:43.160
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.114
But the money is good,
right?

01:47.100 --> 01:47.892
Who are you?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.760
Oh, I'm part of the
neighborhood crime watch.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.595
The way this works is,
you watch, I commit the crime.

01:52.635 --> 01:53.195
Oh, my God.

01:53.235 --> 01:53.765
Now…

01:53.800 --> 01:55.912
Nah, no, no.
There's no talking.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.838
You just give me
your watch and wallet now.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.200
Here's my problem…
you're black.

02:03.235 --> 02:04.800
Oh, Mr Crane!

02:04.835 --> 02:05.365
What?

02:05.400 --> 02:07.800
I'm Denny Crane.
I'm a big shot.

02:07.835 --> 02:09.000
So am I.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.500
If you kill me,
the headline's gonna be,

02:12.535 --> 02:14.900
“black guy
kills white big shot,”

02:15.200 --> 02:17.465
and that's
the last thing we need

02:17.500 --> 02:20.295
when we're trying to elect an
African-American as president.

02:20.335 --> 02:21.265
Dear God.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.695
How about if I just blow
your brains out right now?

02:23.735 --> 02:26.095
That doesn't work for me.
Work for you?

02:26.135 --> 02:27.300
Denny, please.

02:27.335 --> 02:27.865
Hey…

02:27.900 --> 02:30.012
all right, all right, all right.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.200
Watch.

02:35.900 --> 02:36.700
Wallet.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.250
Gun. Knee. Right foot.

02:41.285 --> 02:42.800
Left foot.
–Aah! Oh!

02:43.500 --> 02:44.900
Gah! Oh!

02:47.100 --> 02:49.146
Thank God for guns,
huh, Jerry?

02:50.100 --> 02:51.156
Only in America…

02:51.600 --> 02:54.400
sweet land of Liberty Valance.

Are you all right?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.895
Of course I'm all…
why wouldn't I be all right?

03:27.935 --> 03:29.895
It was just an attempted
mugging and no—

03:29.935 --> 03:31.795
And you absolutely
had to shoot him.

03:31.835 --> 03:32.960
I shoot people all the time.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.395
You had to shoot him
three times.

03:34.435 --> 03:35.623
Uh, if you say so.

03:35.635 --> 03:36.600
In both feet.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.700
Mr Crane?

03:38.800 --> 03:40.395
I told you everything
last night.

03:40.435 --> 03:41.960
Yes, and we
appreciate that, sir

03:42.000 --> 03:45.360
but unfortunately, we haven't
been sent to get your statement.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.095
What is it then,
autograph?

03:47.135 --> 03:48.165
No, sir.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.972
I apologize,
but we're here to arrest you.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.165
Arrest me⁈

03:52.200 --> 03:53.365
What's going on?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.895
Look, if it was up to me,
Mr Crane here would—

03:54.935 --> 03:56.321
What are the charges?

03:56.400 --> 03:57.995
Possession of
a concealed firearm.

03:58.035 --> 03:59.165
Oh, please.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.795
You can't be serious.
This man was mugged.

04:01.835 --> 04:02.660
I realize that.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.260
I also realize
that his having a gun

04:04.300 --> 04:05.660
helped us catch a guy
we been lookin' for,

04:05.700 --> 04:08.736
but the law is the law,
and Mr Crane broke it.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.195
Please place your hands
behind your back, sir.

04:11.235 --> 04:13.865
This is unbelievable.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.195
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:15.235 --> 04:16.160
I know my rights,

04:16.200 --> 04:17.894
and let me tell you,
I'm never silent.

04:17.935 --> 04:20.047
Everything about me
makes noise.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.644
I want those back
when we're done.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.960
The arraignment is at 10:30.

04:47.000 --> 04:47.860
I'm on my way.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.880
Uh, he doesn't want you, Alan.

04:50.200 --> 04:50.760
Excuse me?

04:50.800 --> 04:52.780
He thinks you're too anti-gun.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.300
Oh.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.360
Did he say who he did want?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.600
Angelina Jolie,
but that's not going to happen.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.660
Carl, do you think
you could go?

05:02.700 --> 05:05.400
Me? I'm not pro-gun.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.400
Please.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.100
Alan.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.900
Joanna. Hello.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.202
Sorry to disturb.
I have a bit of an emergency.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.160
My ex-husband, uh,
he's trying to take my daughter.

05:20.200 --> 05:24.028
He says my being a sex surrogate
makes me an unfit mother.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.000
How old is she?
–10.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.995
And I've only worked part-time
since she was born.

05:29.035 --> 05:30.695
I've been pretty much
stay-at-home.

05:30.735 --> 05:32.060
Have you had sole custody?

05:32.100 --> 05:33.895
No, split,
but he's going for sole.

05:33.935 --> 05:35.660
I wouldn't get
to have her at all.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.895
Okay, look, let me, set up
a meeting with his attorney—

05:37.935 --> 05:39.195
He can't win this, can he?

05:39.235 --> 05:40.212
Let me just talk—

05:40.252 --> 05:41.160
She's my little girl.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.444
Joanna,
you're not gonna lose her.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.465
“3-2-8-8-8…

05:51.500 --> 05:53.460
”the Commonwealth vs. Denny Crane,

05:53.500 --> 05:55.260
on the charge of possession
of a concealed we—”

05:55.300 --> 05:57.960
Your honor, Carl Sack for the
defendant; we'll waive the reading.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.465
For God sake,
what has he done now?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.795
What's he done, your honor,
is to have the temerity

06:02.835 --> 06:04.960
to defend himself
against an armed assailant.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.395
The charge is for possession
of a concealed firearm,

06:07.435 --> 06:08.160
not shooting.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.295
I have a constitutional right
to bear arms.

06:10.335 --> 06:11.360
Ask the supreme court.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.195
The supreme court did not
give him the right

06:13.235 --> 06:14.995
to conceal a firearm
without a carry permit.

06:15.035 --> 06:16.260
I got a note from Dick Cheney.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.900
Mr Crane, you are accused
of breaking the law.

06:19.935 --> 06:22.465
You will stand trial.
Is that clear?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.660
Your honor, shouldn't you
recuse yourself?

06:24.700 --> 06:27.360
After all, I did tell you
to bite me that time.

06:27.400 --> 06:27.965
When?

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
It was, uh… oh, come to think
of it, uh, now, actually.

06:32.035 --> 06:32.800
Bite me.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.895
You cannot, cannot, cannot,
cannot antagonize the judge.

06:36.935 --> 06:37.560
Oh, please.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.695
You know the jury will take
its cues from him.

06:39.735 --> 06:40.512
What's going on?

06:40.552 --> 06:41.295
We go to trial.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.000
Uh, Jerry.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.816
You'll be second chairing.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.360
–Won't I be a witness?
–I want you as cocounsel.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.995
Who's better to
close than somebody

06:50.035 --> 06:51.860
who stared down
the barrel of the gun?

06:51.900 --> 06:54.550
–You want him to close?
–Why not?

06:54.585 --> 06:57.200
Denny, do you want
to get off or not?

06:57.235 --> 06:58.423
My place or yours?

06:59.900 --> 07:01.022
Bring the outfit.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.195
Denny, I'm not really
comfortable arguing this one.

07:05.235 --> 07:07.347
Jerry, you want
to make partner?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.912
You gotta take one
for the team.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.860
It's an unstable environment.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.695
She's a perv,
and we're not budging.

07:24.735 --> 07:25.260
Okay, first—

07:25.300 --> 07:27.495
And don't try any of your
disgusting strategies

07:27.535 --> 07:28.765
to unsettle me.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.360
Well, who's to say
what's disgusting?

07:30.400 --> 07:33.395
I could offer to close my eyes
and suck on you

07:33.435 --> 07:35.460
as if you were
a giant love peach.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.995
I'm giving you 30 seconds
to state your case,

07:38.035 --> 07:39.095
and then I'm out the door.

07:39.135 --> 07:39.665
Emma…

07:39.700 --> 07:41.960
And don't call me
by my first name.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.060
Daniella's doing very well with
the current custody arrangement.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.895
She's healthy, happy,
very active.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.660
She gets straight A's
in school.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.345
Her mother sells her body
as a sex worker.

07:52.385 --> 07:55.692
She is not a sex worker;
she's a certified

07:55.727 --> 07:58.965
health professional
who offers sex surrogacy

07:59.000 --> 08:02.600
as one of many therapeutic
approaches to help people

08:02.635 --> 08:03.960
suffering with a dysfunction.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.195
I understand you were
one of her clients.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.000
Yes.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.695
She taught me several things
I'd love to pass on to you.

08:10.735 --> 08:12.160
Should we just get a room?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.200
Disgusting.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.460
Look, we're talking about
a 10-year-old girl here.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.745
I can't have you around her.

08:17.785 --> 08:18.960
Martin, the shared custody—

08:19.000 --> 08:20.995
If you and I don't see
eye to eye,

08:21.035 --> 08:23.213
we can't make decisions
together.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.660
I'm afraid of your influence,

08:24.700 --> 08:27.076
of the impact
you might make on her.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.200
I-I-I just can't have it.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.775
We'll see you in court,
stud muffin.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.700
Whoa! Ooh, tenderloin.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.000
Tease.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.770
Your ex-husband will
testify first, then you.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.700
Okay.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.160
We'll try to avoid
having to call Daniella,

09:04.200 --> 09:08.400
but she'll likely have to at least
talk to a judge in chambers.

09:08.435 --> 09:09.100
Okay.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.300
Joanna, it would take a lot

09:12.600 --> 09:16.400
for a judge to deny a mother
custody of any kind.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.612
Most mothers don't do
what I do.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.100
There's that.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.500
Alan…

09:27.900 --> 09:29.088
how are you doing?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.600
Me? Fine. Why?

09:31.900 --> 09:32.900
Just asking.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.532
Joanna, you never just ask.
What are you getting at?

09:38.100 --> 09:40.806
Well, your dialogue
with opposing counsel

09:40.835 --> 09:43.300
was especially aggressive…

09:44.100 --> 09:45.700
sexually aggressive.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.760
That was just
lawyer's gamesmanship.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.496
The language I heard was…
not simply for another lawyer.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.254
It was for a woman.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.712
Say what's on your mind,
Joanna.

09:57.900 --> 09:58.800
Okay.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.960
Well, I've never
said it before,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.760
but there's a part of you
that's always been sexist.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.060
But now you seem to be
losing the ability,

10:06.100 --> 10:07.486
even the inclination,

10:07.800 --> 10:10.638
to connect with a woman
in a nonsexual way.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.100
What used to be a part
is becoming the whole.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.460
You know, given that

10:18.500 --> 10:21.345
your life with your daughter
is about to be decided,

10:21.385 --> 10:24.195
I would think the last thing
you'd want to do right now

10:24.235 --> 10:25.600
is to distract me.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.822
No, you're right.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.500
I apologize.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.300
Let's go.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.860
We pulled three guns
off him at the scene.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.395
Then when we went to
arrest him the next day,

10:44.435 --> 10:46.260
he had five more guns on him.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.595
He also had a little propane
thing that wasn't legal.

10:48.635 --> 10:49.965
A propane thing?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.560
Yeah, it was a device
strapped to his buttocks.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.580
Basically,
he could break wind

10:54.585 --> 10:56.760
and turn his ass
into a blowtorch.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.095
And did he have any
carry permits for these weapons?

11:00.135 --> 11:01.455
No, sir, he did not.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.295
What would have happened
had Mr Crane not been armed?

11:06.335 --> 11:08.060
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.395
Your honor, this officer
has 15 years experience

11:10.435 --> 11:12.462
with criminals and their conduct.

11:12.502 --> 11:14.548
He has foundation to speculate.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.065
I'll allow it.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.660
So how do you think
it would've gone down?

11:17.700 --> 11:18.995
I'm sure he would've been mugged.

11:19.035 --> 11:20.500
Possibly killed?

11:20.700 --> 11:22.660
Possibly,
but it's also possible—

11:22.700 --> 11:24.395
Thank you, officer.
You've answered my question.

11:24.435 --> 11:26.943
Oh, one more thing,
officer, honestly,

11:27.300 --> 11:30.204
when you arrested Mr Crane,
did you want to?

11:30.235 --> 11:32.900
–Objection!
–That one's sustained.

11:32.935 --> 11:34.900
Oh, your honor, if I may…

11:35.300 --> 11:35.865
What?

11:35.900 --> 11:38.695
By sustaining the objection,
the jury will never learn

11:38.735 --> 11:40.395
that the officer
really didn't want to arrest me,

11:40.435 --> 11:42.679
which he really
didn't want to do.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.795
I'm sorry, but her sex job makes
her an inappropriate parent.

11:46.835 --> 11:48.760
Objection to the term “sex job.”

11:48.800 --> 11:50.960
It's inaccurate
and makes me giggle.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.432
Mr Shore, you turn this
courtroom into a playground,

11:54.500 --> 11:58.328
and I'm gonna come down there
and beat the crap outta you.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.500
Ms Path, please.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.395
And while this would be
a call to action

12:03.435 --> 12:05.865
at any point
in Daniella's life,

12:05.900 --> 12:07.995
it is of even more
pronounced concern

12:08.035 --> 12:09.665
at her current age, yes?

12:09.700 --> 12:12.595
Yes. Girls are entering puberty
earlier and earlier.

12:12.635 --> 12:14.595
This is a very
formative time for her.

12:14.635 --> 12:15.960
A time when her moral

12:16.000 --> 12:18.295
and behavioral foundations
are put into place

12:18.335 --> 12:21.465
about so many things,
about sex.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.660
Kids learn from what
their parents say,

12:23.700 --> 12:25.260
from what their parents do,

12:25.300 --> 12:28.200
even from their unsaid attitudes.

12:28.235 --> 12:31.065
In fact, 60%
of 8 to 11 year olds

12:31.100 --> 12:33.060
say their mothers are
their number one resource

12:33.100 --> 12:37.500
for issues like sex, HIV,
and AIDS, alcohol, drugs…

12:37.535 --> 12:39.795
Aren't you a little
encyclopædic ball of fire?

12:39.835 --> 12:41.760
Mr Shore, do I have to
come down there?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.045
Judge, I'm actually a fan
of corporal punishment,

12:44.085 --> 12:47.055
escially when it comes
from the rugged hands…

12:47.800 --> 12:49.400
but that's just me.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.000
Ms Path,
please continue.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.200
What's your main issue,
Martin?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.400
My ex-wife,
in doing what she does,

12:59.600 --> 13:02.995
is giving Daniella an excessively
permissive take on sex.

13:03.035 --> 13:06.395
She's saying to my daughter,
“it's okay to be sexual

13:06.435 --> 13:08.943
with people you don't love
for money.”

13:09.600 --> 13:10.392
Studies show

13:10.400 --> 13:13.695
that the more often parents
discuss sex with their kids

13:13.735 --> 13:15.760
in an open and
comfortable manner,

13:15.800 --> 13:20.100
the less likely the kids are
to have sex early and casually.

13:20.135 --> 13:21.560
This goes way
beyond discussion.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.950
It's also been found
that the parent needs to

13:25.985 --> 13:30.300
initiate these exchanges,
uh, as 77% of teenagers

13:30.335 --> 13:32.260
simply don't know
how to bring it up.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.660
Shouldn't you
count yourself lucky

13:33.700 --> 13:35.995
that you have a trained
professional in the family,

13:36.035 --> 13:38.609
someone skilled—
–A little too skilled.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.345
You were aware that Joanna
was a sex surrogate

13:43.385 --> 13:46.000
when you married her?
–Well, yes, but—

13:46.035 --> 13:46.695
Did it turn you on?

13:46.735 --> 13:47.467
Objection.

13:47.502 --> 13:48.165
Overruled.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.454
Did it turn you on?

13:49.700 --> 13:52.095
Once you become a parent,
you look at things differently.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.762
That's a yes,
it turned you on.

13:53.802 --> 13:55.360
I told her I wanted her to quit.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.695
We wanted to start a family,
which we did,

13:57.735 --> 13:59.800
and she quit for a while,

14:00.800 --> 14:02.795
but then she went back to work.

14:02.835 --> 14:04.765
Ah. So women
should only work

14:04.800 --> 14:06.345
until they become
wives and mothers

14:06.385 --> 14:07.887
because that's
their real calling,

14:07.927 --> 14:09.360
and a career
is just something to do

14:09.400 --> 14:12.495
until their real lives start,
which is mothering.

14:12.535 --> 14:15.365
I didn't ask her
to quit curing cancer…

14:15.400 --> 14:18.600
or quit teaching kids
to be concert violinists.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.695
I asked her to give up
the orgasm workshops.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.900
–Move to strike.
–Overruled.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.544
Something bothering you,
Mr Shore?

14:38.300 --> 14:40.195
She threatened
to beat you up?

14:40.235 --> 14:40.965
Yes.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.400
–The judge?
–Yes.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.395
And the lawyer.
She'd beat me up if she could.

14:44.435 --> 14:46.095
The little one
who slapped me around?

14:46.135 --> 14:46.700
Yes.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.500
She's a fiery number.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.560
She'd wear you out
at night, I'll bet.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.306
Denny, do you think
you and I are sexist?

14:54.800 --> 14:55.665
Us?

14:55.700 --> 14:57.680
We do tend
to objectify women.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.660
They love that, Alan.
They'd be mad if you didn't.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.360
Do you think you treat women
as your equal?

15:03.400 --> 15:04.765
I'm Denny Crane.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.638
There's no man my equal,
much less a woman.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.500
Ah.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.695
You know who the real sexists
are in this country, Alan?

15:11.735 --> 15:14.695
It's the women. It's the women
media who tore up Hillary,

15:14.735 --> 15:16.160
women who criticized
her pantsuits,

15:16.200 --> 15:21.200
said she wasn't pretty enough,
she should be softer, sexier.

15:21.235 --> 15:22.912
Me? Hell, just give me
the word,

15:22.952 --> 15:24.932
I'll throw her across my desk.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.816
You're such a libertarian.

15:26.900 --> 15:27.560
Alan, you and I

15:27.600 --> 15:30.445
are the last people
who could be called sexist.

15:30.485 --> 15:33.389
We love women, all women,
even the fat ones.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.038
Hell, sometimes I even
prefer the fat ones.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.300
What?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.545
Talking is the predominant
element of surrogate therapy…

15:56.585 --> 16:00.100
um, sharing information,
providing emotional support,

16:00.135 --> 16:01.865
devising coping skills.

16:01.900 --> 16:05.200
There are nonerotic
body awareness exercises,

16:05.235 --> 16:08.162
sensory explorations
and relaxation techniques.

16:08.202 --> 16:11.095
And yet, these folks
depict you as a strumpet

16:11.135 --> 16:12.965
with a plaque on the wall.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.500
Less than 15% of my time
with clients

16:15.535 --> 16:18.367
is spent engaging
in sexual activities.

16:18.402 --> 16:21.165
The goal is to reorient,
to reeducate

16:21.200 --> 16:24.095
so that intimacy is possible,
comfortable and healthy.

16:24.135 --> 16:26.695
But is it primarily about
sexual technique?

16:26.735 --> 16:29.100
It's primarily about intimacy,

16:29.400 --> 16:31.900
which often goes
way deeper than sex.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.360
Some women are self-loathing
and use sex as an affirmation,

16:35.400 --> 16:37.360
which, of course,
completely backfires.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.065
I have many men
who love their wives,

16:40.100 --> 16:43.300
but nevertheless,
hate women on some level.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.865
Uh… and…

16:50.900 --> 16:53.695
you went back to work
after your divorce because?

16:53.735 --> 16:56.360
I was eager to be an example
to my daughter…

16:56.400 --> 16:59.106
of an independent,
self-sufficient woman.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.460
For the most part,
that went very well.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.359
Would you like to explain that
little personal shot at me?

17:07.400 --> 17:08.165
Excuse me?

17:08.200 --> 17:09.460
That comment about
men hating women?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.859
That comment wasn't
somewhat directed at me?

17:11.900 --> 17:15.900
No. I have many male clients
who are repulsed by feminism.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.060
It had nothing to do
with you, Alan.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.395
But the fact
that it hit a nerve is—

17:19.435 --> 17:20.462
Of course it hit a nerve!

17:20.502 --> 17:21.746
You've got my antennæ up.

17:21.786 --> 17:22.960
Then ask yourself why.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.460
Joanna, I am not one of
those men…

17:24.500 --> 17:27.800
who hates women
or is repulsed by feminism.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.800
–I know that.
–I'm not. I'm…

17:36.700 --> 17:38.195
Look, do you want me
to win your daughter back?

17:38.235 --> 17:38.765
I do.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.648
Then don't
unsettle me with…

17:47.100 --> 17:49.295
You know, Alan, you once
told me, when you meet a woman,

17:49.335 --> 17:50.960
the first question
you ask yourself is,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.595
“would I or wouldn't I,
and how would it be?”

17:52.635 --> 17:53.460
That's the first question

17:53.500 --> 17:54.995
every heterosexual male
asks himself.

17:55.035 --> 17:56.421
We're built that way.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.295
And for your information,
it's now more like

18:00.335 --> 18:02.760
the third or fourth question
I ask myself.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.846
That doesn't mean
I hate women.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.595
When I knocked on your door
the other day, you said hello

18:07.635 --> 18:09.095
and mentally undressed me
in a heartbeat.

18:09.135 --> 18:12.400
I do that
with all… people.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.100
You looked fantastic.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.345
The guy pulled a gun on me.
I pulled mine on him.

18:21.385 --> 18:23.595
Yes. The issue here isn't
self-defense so much as—

18:23.635 --> 18:24.795
But it was self-defense.

18:24.835 --> 18:25.160
Absolutely.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.595
I mean,
if I didn't have my gun…

18:26.635 --> 18:27.960
–You'd be dead. Finis.
–Gone.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.595
–I had to shoot, saved my life.
–Boom.

18:29.635 --> 18:30.360
And Jerry's.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.195
Didn't shoot to kill.

18:31.235 --> 18:31.760
Just to wound.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.595
–Took a knee. Boom and boom.
–And two feet. Boom

18:34.635 --> 18:37.500
Objection!
You think this is funny?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.960
Funny uh, did you
have a chuckle

18:40.000 --> 18:42.060
the last time somebody
pulled a gun on you?

18:42.100 --> 18:45.595
This case is about concealing
a handgun on the person,

18:45.635 --> 18:47.165
not about self-defense.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.060
That doesn't mean
we can ignore the reality

18:49.100 --> 18:51.595
that if Mr Crane didn't have
his concealed weapon…

18:51.635 --> 18:54.095
–Dead. Finis. Boom.
–Gone. Boom. And boom.

18:54.135 --> 18:55.367
Objection!

18:55.402 --> 18:56.600
Stop it!

18:59.100 --> 19:01.045
You think you have
a constitutional right

19:01.085 --> 19:03.460
to conceal a weapon
without a carry permit?

19:03.500 --> 19:04.795
I have a right
to keep a gun at home.

19:04.835 --> 19:05.960
The court says so.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.060
You were on the street.

19:07.100 --> 19:10.660
A man's home is where his
heart is. In my case, the penis.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.795
Do you have any idea how many
people die from gun violence

19:12.835 --> 19:13.360
in this country?

19:13.400 --> 19:15.595
Yeah, yeah. Let's make a law…
no carrying guns.

19:15.635 --> 19:17.112
I'm sure the criminals
will obey it.

19:17.152 --> 19:18.560
Show me where
the constitution says

19:18.600 --> 19:21.660
you can walk the streets
armed without a carry permit.

19:21.700 --> 19:25.195
The constitution says whatever
the supreme court says it says.

19:25.235 --> 19:26.862
As for what
the supreme court says,

19:26.902 --> 19:28.495
that all depends
on who's president.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.260
Move to strike.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.760
You don't have to be
a legal genius to know

19:30.800 --> 19:33.595
that if you've got a president
in office who likes guns

19:33.635 --> 19:36.095
and a vice president
who likes to hunt…

19:36.135 --> 19:37.865
lawyers and quail

19:37.900 --> 19:40.295
and a supreme court justice
who hunts with him,

19:40.335 --> 19:41.895
you're gonna have
a constitutional right

19:41.935 --> 19:43.915
to shoot bad guys in the knee.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.960
I swear to you, the man
doesn't have Alzheimer's.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.395
He uses the mad cow as an excuse
to do whatever the hell he wants,

20:00.435 --> 20:03.195
whether it's dropping his pants
or shooting people.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.360
He had a pet scan.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.295
It showed
he has plaque on his brain.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.100
Says who?

20:07.200 --> 20:09.595
He's Denny Crane. You don't
think he could rig a pet scan?

20:09.635 --> 20:12.560
I'm telling you,
the man knows what he's doing.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.184
Is he going to win here?

20:15.500 --> 20:18.800
That I don't know.
We don't really have a defense.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.265
Can you…

20:20.300 --> 20:23.600
explain the wisdom
in letting Jerry close?

20:23.635 --> 20:24.865
Denny's wisdom.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.880
Since Jerry was also a victim,

20:26.900 --> 20:30.095
he's most able to put the jury
in Denny's shoes that night.

20:30.135 --> 20:31.200
Shirley.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.500
Carl.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.500
Shirley, um,

20:35.900 --> 20:38.300
do you find me terribly sexist?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.200
This isn't funny.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.800
Answer the question.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.298
Before I respond, could you
answer a question for me?

20:50.000 --> 20:53.600
Are you finished fiddling
with my cheerleader outfit?

20:53.635 --> 20:55.200
I-I…

20:55.300 --> 20:56.300
that's just…

20:57.400 --> 20:58.700
a textile fetish.

20:58.735 --> 20:59.900
Alan.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.200
I respect women,
every part of a woman.

21:03.235 --> 21:05.300
I'd say especially the parts.

21:05.335 --> 21:06.500
That's right. So…

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
That isn't true, Shirley.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.065
Is it?

21:11.100 --> 21:15.500
Alan, you know you are
an iconic letch.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.760
If it'll make you feel any better,

21:16.800 --> 21:19.506
sometimes even I like
being ogled by you.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.200
So do I.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.700
I think the problem
you're having is…

21:25.300 --> 21:28.500
you feel reduced by the label.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.484
You're not a simple man.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.665
You're extremely complicated,

21:32.700 --> 21:35.700
brilliant, funny, profoundly layered,

21:35.900 --> 21:39.600
but fundamentally, you are, an…

21:40.000 --> 21:43.500
incorrigible, irrepressible dog…

21:46.100 --> 21:47.800
with a textile fetish.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.800
I love this place.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.400
Jerry?

22:21.300 --> 22:22.200
Denny.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.754
What are you doing?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.600
Standing on my desk.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.116
For any particular reason?

22:30.500 --> 22:33.100
I'm having an
out-of-body experience.

22:33.300 --> 22:37.900
I'm looking down on myself
as I deliver my compelling closing.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.300
Come on off the desk there, big fella.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.300
Here, come to papa.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.695
You want to do well here,
don't you?

22:49.735 --> 22:50.265
I do.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.395
'Cause lawyers who get me off
tend to make partner,

22:53.435 --> 22:55.100
especially women lawyers.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.086
Stop laughing, Jerry.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.500
I notice you twiddling
the wooden cigarette.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.460
Makes you feel confident, does it?

23:04.500 --> 23:05.600
It helps.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.386
Look what I got here.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.750
A wooden cigar.

23:10.785 --> 23:11.800
It's yours…

23:13.300 --> 23:15.200
if you do a good job,

23:15.400 --> 23:17.260
and by doing a good job, Jerry,

23:17.300 --> 23:18.660
you personally can ensure

23:18.700 --> 23:22.460
that every American has the right,
the privilege of carrying a gun.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.074
How many lawyers
have that opportunity…

23:26.800 --> 23:27.900
truly, Jerry?

23:31.800 --> 23:34.660
Does your mom ever bring
any of her clients home?

23:34.700 --> 23:35.465
No.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.900
Daniella, what exactly do you know
about your mother's job?

23:39.935 --> 23:42.179
I-I know she's a sexual surrogate.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.100
And you know what
a sexual surrogate does?

23:45.135 --> 23:47.300
She treats people with, like…

23:47.900 --> 23:51.100
sex problems
and problems trusting and stuff.

23:51.135 --> 23:54.265
And you know the nature
of that treatment?

23:54.300 --> 23:57.666
She talks to them,
sometimes she has sex with them.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.182
How do you feel about that?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.100
I don't know. Um…

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
o-okay, I guess. I mean…

24:07.500 --> 24:10.200
It's a little weird, but it's her job.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.045
Daniella, can you tell me
a little bit about

24:13.085 --> 24:15.760
what life is like
at home with your mother?

24:15.800 --> 24:17.365
It's…

24:17.400 --> 24:19.700
I don't know, normal, I guess.

24:19.735 --> 24:21.300
Um, it's home.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.895
And what do you
and your mom do together?

24:23.935 --> 24:25.462
Lots of stuff. We like to hike.

24:25.502 --> 24:26.995
We like to play a lot of games…

24:27.035 --> 24:28.817
you know, hearts, monopoly.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.738
She's one of the coaches
on my soccer team.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.295
But mostly, she kinda nags me
to do my homework

24:34.335 --> 24:36.400
and stop playing “guitar hero.”

24:36.900 --> 24:39.960
Do you ever talk about
your mother's job with her?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.300
Sometimes.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
Daniella,

24:42.900 --> 24:46.860
I know this is an unfair question,
but I am going to ask it.

24:47.600 --> 24:54.500
Do you have a feeling about living either
mostly with your mom or your dad?

24:56.500 --> 25:00.700
We are a nation of laws,
and Mr Crane broke the law.

25:00.735 --> 25:04.900
He carried a concealed weapon…
eight of them, actually.

25:04.935 --> 25:07.360
He has no defense
nor has he offered one.

25:07.400 --> 25:12.500
His only play would be
to challenge the existing law.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.795
He no doubt thinks the recent
supreme court ruling empowers him.

25:16.835 --> 25:18.100
It does not.

25:18.300 --> 25:21.395
The ruling said that an individual
has the right to bear arms.

25:21.435 --> 25:24.362
It does not say he has a right
to conceal them,

25:24.402 --> 25:27.306
nor does it hold
that the state can't impose

25:27.335 --> 25:29.843
reasonable restrictions
on that right.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.400
And this restriction is very reasonable.

25:33.700 --> 25:37.300
30,000 Americans are killed
by guns every year.

25:37.335 --> 25:38.660
To put that in perspective,

25:38.700 --> 25:43.800
we have lost close to 4,000 soldiers
in Iraq during the war.

25:43.835 --> 25:46.160
Kids are killed on the street
walking to school.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.895
People are shot dead in their houses,
their places of work.

25:48.935 --> 25:50.460
Do we really need another Virginia Tech

25:50.500 --> 25:54.395
to realize that this country
has a problem which is epidemic?

25:54.435 --> 25:58.200
There are now more firearms
in homes than pets.

25:58.235 --> 26:00.560
Does the defense
really mean to suggest

26:00.600 --> 26:05.000
that folks be allowed to walk
around concealing their firearms?

26:05.035 --> 26:07.895
Or is it just that Denny Crane
is above the law?

26:07.935 --> 26:08.900
Or maybe,

26:09.300 --> 26:14.265
as his testimony suggests,
it's all in good fun.

26:14.300 --> 26:21.100
Why be so concerned about
something as trivial as human life?

26:33.800 --> 26:37.300
Jerry, you have to get up now.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.765
Human life? Human life?

26:44.800 --> 26:47.795
Can we just please dispense
with the human life jingle?

26:47.835 --> 26:50.760
It's so boring. Of course
we're all pro-human life.

26:50.800 --> 26:55.200
Show of hands. How many in favor
of people not being dead?

26:56.900 --> 27:00.165
But let's face it.
We love guns.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.695
Go to the movies, for
Pete's sake, turn on your TV.

27:02.735 --> 27:05.160
We're a pistol-totin',
gun-lovin' people.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.095
Remember, we started this country
with the shot heard round the world,

27:08.135 --> 27:10.400
not a legislation. Am I right?

27:10.900 --> 27:14.500
Look, Denny Crane
is a lawyer himself, a scholar.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.960
In fact, if there are two legal minds

27:17.000 --> 27:19.060
that were ever in perfect sync
in this country,

27:19.100 --> 27:23.065
it would be those of
Antonin Scalia and Denny Crane.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.595
Check their DNA…
twins separated at birth, I tell you…

27:26.635 --> 27:28.160
Denny and Tony,
Tony and Denny.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.195
Can you imagine Denny Crane
on the supreme court?

27:31.235 --> 27:34.195
Wow. Scalia, Roberts, Thomas,
Alito and Crane…

27:34.235 --> 27:35.895
talk about birds of a feather.

27:35.935 --> 27:37.460
Jerry, what are you doing?

27:37.500 --> 27:40.395
What am I doing? I'm celebrating
the actions of my client.

27:40.435 --> 27:43.295
I'm acknowledging that he,
along with the supreme court…

27:43.335 --> 27:44.760
not all, but the big five…

27:44.800 --> 27:47.345
are smarter than any other
supreme court we've ever had.

27:47.385 --> 27:50.287
I mean, no other supreme court
in our 200-year history

27:50.327 --> 27:53.195
could find a right to bear arms
for nonmilitary purposes,

27:53.235 --> 27:55.365
but suddenly… presto!

27:55.400 --> 27:58.200
Thank God for the big five,
I tell you.

28:01.700 --> 28:02.960
“A well regulated militia

28:03.000 --> 28:05.260
”being necessary to
the security of a free state,

28:05.300 --> 28:09.920
the right of the people to keep
and bear arms shall not be infringed.”

28:10.200 --> 28:15.700
It turns out the trick is
to just ignore the first 13 words.

28:18.100 --> 28:18.865
Home free.

28:18.900 --> 28:22.900
See, big Tony calls this
“the prefatory clause.”

28:22.935 --> 28:24.895
Prefatory…
I guess that means “worthless.”

28:24.935 --> 28:29.300
And this is the operative clause.

28:29.335 --> 28:30.365
Of course.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.895
All this nonsense about the right being
necessary for a well regulated militia,

28:33.935 --> 28:38.500
they put that in for fun,
those founding father jokesters.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.795
We weren't supposed to actually
take this part seriously.

28:40.835 --> 28:43.062
How could all those
stupid supreme courts

28:43.102 --> 28:45.260
over the last 200 years
have fallen for that?

28:45.300 --> 28:48.760
–May I have a word with cocounsel—
–No, you may not. Sit down, Hacky Sack.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.095
And enough with this “we're
a nation of laws” crapola.

28:51.135 --> 28:53.095
Please, we're a nation of politics.

28:53.135 --> 28:54.260
Am I right? Am I right?

28:54.300 --> 28:57.095
The laws are simply devices
to serve our ideologies.

28:57.135 --> 28:57.960
For example, this court,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.745
which is the smartest
in the history of the world,

29:00.785 --> 29:03.460
trumpeted individual liberties
to protect guns?

29:03.500 --> 29:07.196
But as for individual liberties
for criminal defendants?

29:07.500 --> 29:08.060
Who needs 'em?

29:08.100 --> 29:09.860
And then in the Guantanamo case,

29:09.900 --> 29:12.145
big Tony said individual
liberties be damned

29:12.185 --> 29:14.360
when it means more human lives
might be lost,

29:14.400 --> 29:17.095
but in the gun's case, it's hail,
hail individual liberties,

29:17.135 --> 29:18.895
even though more human lives
might be lost.

29:18.935 --> 29:19.960
That's consistent.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.500
See, big Tony knows the score.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.900
Look to your politics.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.800
That'll tell you what the law is.

29:27.835 --> 29:28.665
Jerry.

29:28.700 --> 29:29.860
Pipe down, sacky-boy.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.260
These are smart judges,
these supreemies.

29:32.300 --> 29:36.900
And, boy, once we got the newbies,
Roberts and Alito, the preemies…

29:37.100 --> 29:39.765
the possibilities are just boundless.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.495
They don't have to be bound by the
constitution or the founding fathers.

29:43.535 --> 29:46.795
Seems they'r not even bound
by their own principles.

29:46.835 --> 29:47.700
Jerry.

29:47.900 --> 29:48.900
Consider…

29:49.200 --> 29:53.195
they always say political questions
should be decided by elected officials,

29:53.235 --> 29:55.765
but as for guns… nuh-uh!

29:55.800 --> 29:59.395
They say we need to pay close attention
to the precise words in the constitution,

29:59.435 --> 30:01.965
but for guns… nuh-uh!

30:02.000 --> 30:04.600
They say they loathe judicial activism,

30:04.635 --> 30:07.165
but when it comes to guns…
nuh-uh!

30:07.200 --> 30:10.060
Don't you just love
these preemies? Mccain does.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.860
He wants to go out and find
more judges exactly like them.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.995
He's a smarty-pants, too, that Mccain.
He knows how to become president.

30:16.035 --> 30:19.395
He once cosponsored a bill
closing the gun show loophole.

30:19.435 --> 30:21.465
But now? Nuh-uh!

30:21.500 --> 30:24.460
He now believes the second
amendment means no gun control.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.395
That might make him even smarter
than big Tony and the preemies.

30:27.435 --> 30:29.265
And Obama, he's no dummy.

30:29.300 --> 30:33.656
He once took a stand on firearms,
but in his blueprint for change…

30:33.800 --> 30:34.700
nada,

30:34.800 --> 30:36.318
nothing on gun control.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.660
I guess we don't need
that much change.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.595
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you cannot convict Denny Crane.

30:41.635 --> 30:44.407
If anything, this man
should be canonized.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.195
Oh, don't you love that word?
Canonized.

30:46.235 --> 30:47.360
Sounds like a big gun.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.160
Show of hands,
how many are titillated?

30:49.200 --> 30:51.160
Denny Crane, like big Tony,
like the preemies,

30:51.200 --> 30:53.895
he doesn't look at the meaning
of the constitution and say why.

30:53.935 --> 30:57.200
He sees meanings that never were

30:57.235 --> 30:59.400
and says why not?

30:59.500 --> 31:01.665
My client is a real American…

31:01.700 --> 31:04.365
flag on his lapel,
gun in his pants.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.565
He shoots bad guys.
Boom, boom. Boom, boom.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.195
There is nothing more red,
white and blue than him,

31:10.235 --> 31:12.695
a man who knows,
as does our president,

31:12.735 --> 31:14.300
as do the big five…

31:15.400 --> 31:20.000
human life is simply no match
for a gun.

31:32.700 --> 31:33.995
What the hell was that⁈

31:34.035 --> 31:35.260
Was I not compelling?

31:35.300 --> 31:37.365
You just sent him to jail.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.565
What could possibly possess you?

31:39.600 --> 31:42.195
You did, for starters. You said
to give Denny what he needs.

31:42.235 --> 31:43.700
He needed to lose.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.400
He needed to lose.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.074
And you made that decision?
–Denny did.

31:50.300 --> 31:54.295
Carl, my friend, the trick to
changing a law is not to beat it,

31:54.335 --> 31:55.400
but to get beat.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.060
Then you can appeal
to a court that can change it.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.460
What are you talking about?

32:00.500 --> 32:04.790
The Massachusetts legislature
is never gonna let us pack pistols.

32:04.900 --> 32:07.408
You gotta get it
to the supreme court.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.984
They'll take care of it.

32:10.200 --> 32:10.960
You can't be serious.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.100
You want to lose so you can
appeal to the supreme court?

32:16.700 --> 32:18.000
Jerry, my boy,

32:18.200 --> 32:21.600
let me present you a wooden cigar.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.950
You earned it, my friend.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.000
Thank you.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.860
I'm a professional woman.
I have kids.

32:31.900 --> 32:35.600
They understand what I do.
They ask me about my work.

32:35.700 --> 32:39.660
They're proud to have me
come to their school for career day.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.200
And when I get this paycheck,

32:42.300 --> 32:43.660
they can feel confident

32:43.700 --> 32:47.990
that it doesn't represent one
minute of me engaging in a sex act.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.810
Will this be the case for Daniella?

32:51.800 --> 32:53.765
What's in her best interests?

32:53.800 --> 32:57.600
Daniella's best interests
lie with her father.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.965
Let's not be outfoxed
by the fancy talk

33:01.000 --> 33:04.995
and therapy-jargonized argument
of Ms Monroe and her sleazy lawyer

33:05.035 --> 33:08.500
and allow Daniella
to be exposed to a woman

33:08.535 --> 33:11.165
who employs questionable philosophies

33:11.200 --> 33:15.300
and unfit moral practices
in her chosen career.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.160
The general laws
of Massachusetts state that

33:18.200 --> 33:21.745
custody of a child includes
the right and responsibility

33:21.785 --> 33:25.295
to see to the child's welfare
and make major decisions

33:25.335 --> 33:29.767
about his or her education
and medical care

33:29.802 --> 33:34.200
and emotional, moral
and religious development.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.200
Give Daniella's father sole custody.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.000
Don't make me hit you.

33:51.500 --> 33:55.365
There was an incident
in a shopping mall recently

33:55.400 --> 33:59.495
that incited a storm of protests
and was well-covered by the media.

33:59.535 --> 34:02.962
Apparently a woman was
thrown out of a lingerie store

34:03.002 --> 34:06.901
because while she was sitting
next to a mannequin

34:06.936 --> 34:10.800
that was wearing only a thong
and a peekaboo bra,

34:10.835 --> 34:13.195
the woman started
to breastfeed her baby.

34:13.235 --> 34:14.960
Meanwhile, back in the capital,

34:15.000 --> 34:19.165
attorney general John Ashcroft
had mammoth drapes

34:19.199 --> 34:24.600
purchased to obscure two statues in the
great hall of the department of justice

34:24.635 --> 34:28.100
because the female statue,
spirit of justice,

34:28.135 --> 34:29.965
has one breast uncovered

34:30.000 --> 34:33.100
and the male statue, majesty of law,

34:33.135 --> 34:35.766
is bare-chested and wears a loincloth.

34:35.802 --> 34:38.364
–What is your point?
–My point is,

34:38.400 --> 34:43.699
this country has a profoundly
paradoxical relationship with sex.

34:43.735 --> 34:45.764
We damn infidelity,

34:45.800 --> 34:48.395
but our presidents have had
extramarital affairs

34:48.435 --> 34:49.860
in and out of the white house.

34:49.900 --> 34:53.100
The mistress keeping
and rendezvousing of FDR,

34:53.135 --> 34:54.864
LBJ, Billy Bob Clinton

34:54.900 --> 34:58.565
and grand champ JFK are legendary,

34:58.600 --> 35:01.595
and other than the politically
motivated impeaching of Billy Bob,

35:01.635 --> 35:02.260
we went with it.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.295
We didn't say you've engaged in
inappropriate sexual behavior

35:05.335 --> 35:08.960
our culture finds inexcusable,
so give up your children.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.495
And by the way, when
it comes to our children,

35:11.535 --> 35:14.317
we've entirely lost our heads.

35:14.352 --> 35:17.065
When parents were surveyed about

35:17.100 --> 35:21.100
what they found most offensive
in their kids' video games,

35:21.135 --> 35:25.062
a man and a woman having sex
came in first as most offensive,

35:25.102 --> 35:28.995
beating out graphically severed
human head, which came in third.

35:29.035 --> 35:30.860
And yet we have
more and more women

35:30.900 --> 35:33.395
proudly declaring
to their friends over coffee,

35:33.435 --> 35:35.695
“I'm a MILF
at my kid's high school.”

35:35.735 --> 35:38.165
M-I-L-F…
mother I'd like to…

35:38.200 --> 35:40.195
forgive me for speaking
this way in court.

35:40.235 --> 35:41.360
Evidently, we've decided,

35:41.400 --> 35:44.195
instead of our traditional
desexing of mothers,

35:44.235 --> 35:45.860
we now need to sex them up a bit.

35:45.900 --> 35:49.100
Just talk about the fitness
of this mother.

35:49.300 --> 35:52.465
Joanna is a wonderful mother.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.765
And part of her job
is to help people

35:55.800 --> 36:00.100
find some semblance of order
in this paralyzing mess,

36:00.135 --> 36:02.865
to help people find some clarity.

36:02.900 --> 36:06.900
In today's world, we should
all be assigned someone

36:06.935 --> 36:10.900
to help us navigate the waters
of sex and sexism,

36:10.935 --> 36:13.400
because it's so easy to get lost,

36:13.435 --> 36:17.100
so woefully, woefully lost.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.245
We need to bring sex
out of the dark shadows

36:20.285 --> 36:22.991
where it can get twisted
and torqued and…

36:24.000 --> 36:27.800
we think nothing of using sex
to sell products

36:27.835 --> 36:31.165
or movies,
television shows, magazines,

36:31.200 --> 36:36.800
but when someone is addressing sex
in a real, true, honest way,

36:36.835 --> 36:39.900
that's immoral?
That's inappropriate?

36:39.935 --> 36:40.965
That's unfit?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.865
All right, you win.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.065
I am maintaining dual custody.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.195
Well, if you don't mind, I'd still
like to finish what I have to say.

36:48.235 --> 36:49.165
No.

36:49.200 --> 36:53.000
Mr Monroe, what she does
is clearly unconventional,

36:53.035 --> 36:56.667
but there is no sign that
it's an unstable environment,

36:56.702 --> 37:00.300
and there's no evidence
that your ex-wife is unfit.

37:00.335 --> 37:03.100
Therefore, we are adjourned.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.460
Thank you, your honor.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.400
Yes.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.100
Thank you, Alan.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.860
Will it go straight
to the supreme court?

37:21.900 --> 37:23.895
Well, no. You'd have to
lose at the appeals court.

37:23.935 --> 37:25.760
Then you'd have to lose again
with the SJC.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.760
But not to worry. Jerry's
closing will get the job done.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.400
Mr Foreman, you have
reached a unanimous verdict?

37:32.435 --> 37:34.260
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

37:34.300 --> 37:37.495
“In the matter of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts vs. Denny Crane

37:37.535 --> 37:40.760
”on the charge of carrying
a concealed firearm without a permit,

37:40.800 --> 37:43.900
”we the jury find the defendant,
Denny Crane,

37:43.935 --> 37:44.900
not guilty.”

37:45.200 --> 37:45.765
We won?

37:45.800 --> 37:48.200
–What⁈
–Your honor, we appeal.

37:48.235 --> 37:50.600
You can't appeal an acquittal.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.400
You're the defendant.

37:52.435 --> 37:54.100
This isn't right.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.324
What happened?

37:55.335 --> 37:56.200
Sorry, Denny.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.314
Guess you can't lose 'em all.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.000
I can't lose any.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.614
You really had your hopes up.

38:08.300 --> 38:11.000
Well, it's one thing to be an icon…

38:13.200 --> 38:15.200
but to be a cause célèbre…

38:16.300 --> 38:17.500
a martyr even…

38:18.100 --> 38:20.995
the idea of famous Hollywood people
wearing a button…

38:21.035 --> 38:22.565
”free Denny“…

38:22.600 --> 38:25.760
I don't think Hollywood types
wear buttons for gun nuts.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.895
You actually think
I'm a nut to carry a gun?

38:27.935 --> 38:29.260
To carry five all at once?

38:29.300 --> 38:31.495
Yes, Denny. That raises you
to lunatic status.

38:31.535 --> 38:33.800
Oh, and you would never own one.

38:33.835 --> 38:34.660
I didn't say that.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.895
You're afraid to even
hold one, you girl, you.

38:36.935 --> 38:39.400
I have one, in a safe at home.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.500
A .38.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.800
–You have a .38?
–Yes.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.180
I see nothing wrong with that.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.260
I see a lot wrong with assault weapons

38:48.300 --> 38:50.695
and people walking around
like you, with guns.

38:50.735 --> 38:51.860
Have you ever shot it?

38:51.900 --> 38:53.400
Just target practice.

38:53.700 --> 38:56.802
I can't fathom a liberal
like you owning a gun.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.260
That's one of the problems
in this country.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.895
We have two camps… those that
like guns and those that don't.

39:02.935 --> 39:03.860
Why can't there be a middle?

39:03.900 --> 39:06.895
Why can't we say okay to guns
and okay to gun legislation?

39:06.935 --> 39:09.160
Why does it make someone
a pinko-liberal-girl

39:09.200 --> 39:14.000
if he supports background checks
and bans on assault weapons?

39:14.035 --> 39:16.360
That's a sexist remark.
You realize that?

39:16.400 --> 39:17.065
What?

39:17.100 --> 39:19.000
“A pinko-liberal-girl.”

39:19.035 --> 39:20.900
Girls can like guns.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.300
Never mind.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.800
Just let me drink.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
Fine.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.000
I am sexist.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.934
When I see a woman,
my first thoughts are sexual.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.360
It's not that I don't
respect her intelligence,

39:39.400 --> 39:42.260
it's not that I wouldn't want
a woman to be president,

39:42.300 --> 39:43.660
I'll even admit to the possibility

39:43.700 --> 39:47.900
that women are emotionally
and intellectually superior to men,

39:47.935 --> 39:52.100
but I cannot deny,
there's a part of me that…

39:53.200 --> 39:57.200
sees a woman as this big,
human mitten,

39:57.400 --> 40:01.954
perfectly designed to keep my cockles
warm on a cold, winter's night.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.400
Oh, Alan. It's cultural.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.900
It's biological. And…

40:09.300 --> 40:10.300
it's fun.

40:12.100 --> 40:16.150
There are many ways
men go dead as they age.

40:16.185 --> 40:20.165
One way, they start incorporating
all the learned,

40:20.200 --> 40:23.395
politically correct behavior
and thoughts into who they are,

40:23.435 --> 40:26.009
and in the process,
deny what they are.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.350
What are we?

40:27.385 --> 40:28.500
Animals.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.504
Today's evolved men
talk to each other about

40:32.100 --> 40:34.600
politics and kids and education.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.800
They talk about anything
and everything,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.310
and yet are profoundly lonely. Why?

40:41.400 --> 40:46.200
'Cause they're ashamed
to share their most base instinct.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.560
You and I are not like that.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.595
When we're 90,
wll be sitting on a park bench,

40:51.635 --> 40:52.460
a pretty girl will go by,

40:52.500 --> 40:55.536
and we'll say,
”look at the rack on that one.”

40:57.200 --> 41:00.300
You and I will never, ever be lonely.

41:02.100 --> 41:05.960
And if the girl has a boyfriend
who comes to confiscate our walkers?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.200
I've got my gun.

41:07.235 --> 41:08.400
I feel better.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.400
You should.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.600
Alan…

41:14.089 --> 41:16.705
embrace your inner wolf.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.584
You listen to Denny now.

41:21.300 --> 41:22.200
Yes.
