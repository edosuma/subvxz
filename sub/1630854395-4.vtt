00:07.007 --> 00:08.717
- Oscar, seagull.
- [imitates seagull cry]

00:08.758 --> 00:10.510
Oh! Five points--
it touched your lips.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.345
Chance, seagull.
- [imitates seagull cry]

00:12.387 --> 00:14.681
- There you go--ten points!
Man, game over. You win.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.474
You're the king
of the garbage birds.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.768
Collect your winnings
off the floor.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.145
- Dad, that's enough.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.688
Last time I took Chance
to the beach,

00:21.730 --> 00:23.857
he fought an actual seagull
for a fry.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.527
- Yeah, but he won,
and we ate good that day.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.988
- Mom, did you get
my birthday invitations?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.198
- Yep, thanks to the printer
at work.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.325
Oh, I also swiped
these poop bags

00:34.367 --> 00:36.494
to put the party favors in.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.121
- This is for you, Grandpa.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.539
You're coming, right?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.291
- Of course I'll be there.
We're roommates.

00:41.332 --> 00:44.252
I think it would be
really awkward if I didn't go.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.838
- [clears throat]
Hello. I'm right here.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.925
- We're at full capacity,
but you're on the wait list.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.844
- Then so is your gift.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.096
It's ham.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.391
- His birthday's
at the insect museum?

00:58.433 --> 00:59.976
- Yeah.
- With all the dead bugs?

01:00.018 --> 01:01.186
- Mm-hmm.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.479
- I'll save you
some money, Mayan.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.022
I stepped on a cockroach
this morning.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.233
It's still stuck to my shoe.
I'll show it to you for free.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.235
- Do you think the museum
has ladybugs?

01:09.277 --> 01:10.570
I always wondered
what it would be like

01:10.612 --> 01:12.739
to go on a fancy date with one.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.825
[British accent] Hello, milady.
Fancy a crumpet?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.122
- And that's why
you're not invited.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.791
You're a whole freak.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.796

01:41.893 --> 01:43.603
- What are you guys doing?
- Paying bills.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.980
- Very responsible.
Got to go.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.649
- Hold up.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.193
Look, we know it's been hard
for you losing your home,

01:50.235 --> 01:51.569
keeping your business afloat,

01:51.611 --> 01:54.406
zipping up your pants
after five beers.

01:54.447 --> 01:58.118
We're not asking you for rent.
- Whew. Okay, I'll stay.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.287
- I'm here.
- Now I want to go again.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.872
- I have exciting news.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.375
Your <i>tías</i>are coming to town
for Chance's birthday.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.211
- Wait, my actual <i>tías</i>or the
ladies you made me call <i>"tías,"</i>

02:08.253 --> 02:10.130
like your cousins,
your coworkers,

02:10.171 --> 02:12.424
and your favorite cashier
at Chico's?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.134
- Mm, Janet and I
aren't speaking,

02:14.175 --> 02:16.302
and it's up to her
to make it right.

02:16.344 --> 02:19.389
Anyway, it's Daisy, Lily,
and Flor,

02:19.431 --> 02:21.599
the <i>tías</i>from New York
who travel together.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.851
- They share one broomstick

02:22.892 --> 02:26.479
unless they decided
to go Jet <i>Bruja.</i>

02:26.521 --> 02:27.939
- Well, I've never met them.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.566
So I hope I can make
a good impression.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.318
- Unless your name is
Julio Iglesias, Andy Garcia,

02:32.360 --> 02:34.320
or a Carnival Cruise Line
captain,

02:34.362 --> 02:36.573
they're not going
to be impressed.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.617
- I am just excited to
practice my Spanish with them.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.661
See, I already got
my Mexican accent down.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.330
And now I get to showcase
my Cuban one.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.250
Ready? In Mexican, it's...

02:47.292 --> 02:49.961
[speaking Spanish]

02:51.171 --> 02:53.256
And in Cuban, it's...

02:57.469 --> 02:59.512
Accent's all in the hands.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.890
I'm going to iron my guayabera.

03:03.641 --> 03:07.020
- Don't worry. I'll make sure
he does none of that.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.229
- He should just speak English.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.106
They don't like it
when people try so hard.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.650
- Oh, then they're going
to love the dead bug party,

03:12.692 --> 03:16.363
because clearly Mayan didn't
try too hard planning that.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.157
Was the roadkill museum
closed?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.909
- Hey, this is
what Chance wants.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.410
I know my son.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.995
- And I know how to show
that kid a good time.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.039
So come on, Mayan,
let me plan this birthday.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.291
Remember all the great
birthday parties I threw you?

03:28.333 --> 03:31.419
- I threw them.
You threw up at them.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.380
- I remember one year
you drank so much

03:33.421 --> 03:35.048
that you passed out
in the bounce house.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.383
- Best sleep of my life.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.550
It's soft in there,

03:37.592 --> 03:40.553
hugs your curves
in all the right places.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.055
- You never even got me gifts.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.933
I asked you for a puppy
every year until I was 14,

03:44.974 --> 03:48.019
but the closest I got was that
woman you dated named Fifi.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.273
- She always came
when I called her.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.527
Good Fifi.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.945
Mayan, if I had given you
a dog,

03:56.986 --> 03:58.697
you would have gotten
your fill of dogs,

03:58.738 --> 03:59.989
and then you
would have never wanted

04:00.031 --> 04:03.076
to pursue a career as a vet,
so you're welcome.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.204
- I wanted to be a vet
because of "Air Bud."

04:06.246 --> 04:09.666
- I thought it was because
of "Beverly Hills Chihuahua."

04:11.209 --> 04:13.503
Come on, Mayan, this is my
first birthday with Chance.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.423
Let me throw him
a classic Lopez backyard banger

04:16.464 --> 04:18.550
with a bounce house,
a piñata, and chickens

04:18.591 --> 04:21.928
that start out as entertainment
and end up as dinner.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.014
- Mayan and Quentin
can't afford all that.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.516
Look how they dress.

04:26.558 --> 04:30.812
- They can't,
but you can, sugar mama.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.981
Picture this--
a banner that says

04:33.023 --> 04:34.524
"Chance's Seventh Birthday,

04:34.566 --> 04:37.986
"sponsored
by Rosie La Reina's Insurance.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.946
<i>Se habla inglés."</i>

04:41.573 --> 04:42.782
You know how many people

04:42.824 --> 04:44.284
come to a Latino kid's
birthday party?

04:44.325 --> 04:46.453
And I can guarantee you none
of them will have insurance.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.622
- I'm in.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.915
- All right,
I got to go talk to Oscar.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.250
He's got a hookup
at the party store.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.003
Her name is Brenda,
and she's got nice balloons.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.215
- There's no way he actually
follows through with this.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.842
- Oh, no way in hell.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.678
All he's going to do is hit on
that girl at the party store.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.638
Oh, I should call ahead
and warn her.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.518
<i>* *</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:13.897
[birds chirping]

05:16.608 --> 05:18.693
- What's going on?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.528
You actually came through?

05:20.570 --> 05:22.489
If there's one thing
I can rely on you for,

05:22.530 --> 05:24.866
it's being unreliable.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.035
- I'm adulting.
I'm an adulterer.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.538
- I got some bad news.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.998
I think the bounce house
is broken.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.085
I tried blowing into it,
but it won't inflate.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.504
- It has a motor, fool.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.090
What did you even blow into?

05:40.131 --> 05:42.133
- Before you start
blowing anything up,

05:42.175 --> 05:43.510
we should check with Chance

05:43.551 --> 05:45.553
to see if this
is what he really wants.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.764
I'm sure he wants a bug party.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.517
He's so excited that he started
his own bug collection,

05:50.558 --> 05:53.186
and now I have
to burn his sheets.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.981
- Oh, those ants are my fault.
I keep hot dogs under the bed.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.441
Why do you think
I'm never hungover?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.859
- Chance?

05:59.901 --> 06:01.986
- Eh, I was just about
to do that--Chance.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.697
- It's not a competition.
Chance!

06:03.738 --> 06:06.783
- Then why am I winning?
Chance!

06:08.410 --> 06:11.996
- I got a bounce house?
This party's about to be lit!

06:12.038 --> 06:14.499
- What about the bugs?
- They're dead.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.544
They'll still be dead next
week.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.546
- I guess he's okay with it.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.256
Want to see a live chicken?

06:21.297 --> 06:24.509
Say hello to Hennifer Lopez.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.760

06:25.802 --> 06:27.929
- Don't get too attached.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.190

enjoying the party?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.859
- It's the best, Grandpa.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.068
- Did you do what I said?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.446
- Yes, I got
three girls' numbers...

06:44.487 --> 06:47.991
as soon as they're old enough
to have phones.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.201
- And as soon as you're
old enough to get a phone,

06:50.243 --> 06:51.494
I'll show you
how to save their numbers

06:51.536 --> 06:53.705
as Domino's, Pizza Hut,
and Little Caesars.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.998
- Why?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.416
- Because when you get older,

06:56.458 --> 06:58.084
you're going to want to eat
a lot of different pizza

06:58.126 --> 07:00.086
from a lot
of different places...

07:00.128 --> 07:02.380
thin and thick crust.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.385
- Your dad and I really nailed
this party, didn't we?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.220
- Yeah, it's great--

07:09.262 --> 07:11.389
almost like two adult children
got high

07:11.431 --> 07:13.350
and planned a birthday party.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.227
- Okay, what's going on
with your vibe?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.729
- What are you talking about?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.440
- Mm, I can tell when
something's bothering a woman.

07:20.482 --> 07:24.444
I have, how do you say,
women's intuition.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.822
- Oh, Lord.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.658
- I'm getting the feeling
that you're bummed

07:30.700 --> 07:33.745
that Chance chose
this big party over your idea.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.080
- No.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.748
I want him to be happy.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.792
If he's happy, I'm happy.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.253
- But you don't sound happy.

07:42.295 --> 07:46.216
- I'm having the time
of my life, <i>menso.</i>

07:46.257 --> 07:47.425
- Okay, this is

07:47.467 --> 07:50.637
women-on-women's-intuition
violence.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.889
- Ay, there he is.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.518
Quinten, this is Tía Daisy.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.437
- Your kind eyes remind me

07:59.479 --> 08:02.899
of my late husband, Raymundo.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.859
- I'm sorry for your loss.
When did he pass?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.529
- 25 years ago.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.281
But when you wear him
in a locket around your neck,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.867
it's like it was yesterday.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.581
- And this is Tía Lily.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.501
- It's actually
Mrs. Dr. Lily Rodriguez.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.169
- Oh, are you a doctor?

08:23.211 --> 08:26.881
- My husband is,
so pretty much.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.843
- And my cousin Flor.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.386
- I love your sparkly visor.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.430
- Would you believe
I make them myself?

08:33.471 --> 08:36.016
I sell them on "Es-ty."

08:36.057 --> 08:37.976
- Well, Quinten does well, too.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.311
He works
at the Apple Genius Bar.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.855
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.648
I'm going to go
make us some drinks.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.191
Why don't you tell them
about the time

08:45.233 --> 08:47.777
that you fixed
Enrique Iglesias's phone.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.779
[ladies gasp]

08:49.821 --> 08:53.992
- Okay, so, uh,
he brought it in,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.827
and I fixed it.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.912
- But where was Julio?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.001
- Can you reset
my facial recognition?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.795
It hasn't worked since I got
stung on the lips by a bee

09:05.837 --> 09:09.049
and the swelling spread
to my breasts.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.468
- Sure, no problem.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.430
- [speaking Spanish]

09:20.393 --> 09:23.396
- [speaking Spanish]

<i>- Déjame decirte algo...</i>

09:31.488 --> 09:33.740

09:35.909 --> 09:38.870
[laughter]

09:42.791 --> 09:44.501
- Oh, hey, papa.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.544
How about you hang
with your mom for a little bit?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.755
- Maybe later.
Right now I'm having fun.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.382
- So am I!

09:52.300 --> 09:54.761
- Girl...

09:54.803 --> 09:57.222
- We're going to play
Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.723
Grandpa says he's the best

09:58.765 --> 10:01.518
because he's been chasing tail
his whole life.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.271
I didn't get it,

something,

11:10.795 --> 11:12.255
and it might be upsetting.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.674
- Oh, I already know
about your inverted nipples.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.761
- Not what I was going to say.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.722
But update--they reverted.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.309
I overheard the <i>tías</i>talking
about you.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.562
They didn't realize
that I understand Spanish.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.814
- Interesting.
What did they say?

11:29.856 --> 11:32.317
- Oh, just g-general stuff,

11:32.359 --> 11:34.194
like how you're struggling
with business

11:34.235 --> 11:37.906
and fashion choices and lack
of romantic fulfillment.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.827
- So they called me a hoochie
who can't get laid?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.205
- A broke hoochie.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.998
Sorry.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.334
If you hate me for telling you,
I completely understand.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.752
- I don't hate you.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.797
That was a test.
You passed.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.382
- I'm sorry, what?

11:55.423 --> 11:57.801
- I left you alone
with those <i>chismosas</i>on purpose

11:57.842 --> 12:00.136
to see if you would report
back, and you did.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.514
I trust you now.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.182
- You didn't trust me before?

12:04.224 --> 12:07.644
Rosie, I've been with Mayan
for eight years.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.187
- But you're not married,

12:09.229 --> 12:10.939
so you have to keep proving
your loyalty.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.942
If you want the tests to stop,
put a ring on it.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.819
- It's always fun.
No matter where we start,

12:15.860 --> 12:18.863
we always end up
right back here.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.950
So are you mad at the <i>tías</i>now?
- Ay, no.

12:21.991 --> 12:26.037
In our family,
<i>chisme</i>is our love language.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.789
If we stop talking crap
about you,

to get away from her.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.220
- Oh, my.
- Mm-hmm.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.890
And Lily's big-deal doctor
husband works at the morgue.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.143
I think he helped Raymundo
fake his death.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.521
- No!

12:51.563 --> 12:53.148
- Mm-hmm.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.483
And you want to hear
the biggest shock of them all?

12:55.525 --> 12:57.902
Flor doesn't bedazzle
her own visors.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.239
She outsources to Thailand.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.074
- Get out!

13:03.116 --> 13:05.410
I mean, her visors are nice,

13:05.452 --> 13:07.245
but they aren't even
that sparkly, right?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.955
- Don't talk about my family.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.876
- I thought you--
because you said--

13:12.917 --> 13:14.878
Isn't that how you show
that you care?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.588
- Yes, us.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.424
But not you.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.395
- Thank God I passed your test.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.024
- [laughs]

13:37.150 --> 13:39.069
- Just coming over
for a feelings check.

13:39.110 --> 13:42.614
Talk to me.
This is a safe space.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.783
- Not for you.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.868
- Let's just be honest
with each other.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.453
I'll go first.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.874
Sometimes I think
about your mom in the shower.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.211
- What?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.254
- Now you admit that
you're jealous of this party.

13:58.296 --> 14:02.550
- No. I'm just annoyed
that my dad has Chance thinking

14:02.592 --> 14:05.428
that every birthday
has to be bigger and better.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.181
So next year he's going
to expect a private party

14:08.223 --> 14:11.017
on a yacht like he's El Chapo.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.561
They're already
the same height.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.021
- I don't buy it.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.525
- Ugh.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.195
And now his big head
is in the bounce house.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.322
Adults aren't allowed in there.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.907
I'm going in.
- Wait.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.827
I don't think it's safe to go
in there with the cake cutter.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.912
- Dad, get out of there.

14:30.954 --> 14:34.040
[pop, air hissing]

14:36.292 --> 14:38.211
- What the hell, Mayan?
You stabbed the bounce house!

14:38.253 --> 14:40.714
I was going to sleep
in here tonight.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.882
- It was an accident!

14:44.884 --> 14:47.220
- I blew it up with my mouth.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.812
- Agh!

14:55.854 --> 14:57.897
Can someone get us
out of here?

14:57.939 --> 15:01.067
- Not yet.
It's still hugging my curves.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.532
- Look what you did.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.908
Now I'll never get
my deposit back.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.660
- That's Mom's deposit.
She paid for it.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.246
- I know.
I was going to keep it.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.914
So what gives, Mayan?

15:14.956 --> 15:16.875
I give Chance a great
birthday party, and you're mad?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.543
It's like you don't want me
to have fun with my grandson.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.380
- Why does he get
that when I never did?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.049
- Oh, so that's what it is.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.468
- I never got to do
a piñata with you

15:26.509 --> 15:28.178
or blow out candles.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.846
I wanted to be spun so hard

15:29.888 --> 15:32.390
that I stuck a pin
in a <i>tía's</i>butt.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.894
- So I do everything right,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.313
and you're still throwing
the past in my face.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.814
- No!

15:41.066 --> 15:42.734
Yeah.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.112
It's screwed up.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.406
I mean, you're finally
showing up for him

15:48.448 --> 15:51.034
in ways you never showed up
for me,

15:51.076 --> 15:53.536
and I can't handle it.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.663
And now my kid's birthday
is ruined

15:55.705 --> 15:57.082
because I'm jealous.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.422
- I'll go.
You've hurt her enough.

got destroyed,

16:17.102 --> 16:18.645
my ass got stabbed,

16:18.687 --> 16:22.565
and this cake appears
to only have <i>dos leches...</i>

16:22.607 --> 16:25.360
this has been
a beautiful party.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.278

16:27.320 --> 16:29.072
Well, it's about to get better.

Quinten has offered

16:39.249 --> 16:41.876

parking below TJ Maxx.

16:49.175 --> 16:53.054
- Well, I prefer Marshalls,
but okay.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.184
- Oh, your voice recorder
is on.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.604
You must have accidentally hit
the button earlier.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.773
- Oh, that's okay.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.275

I'll just delete it.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.943
<i>- Ay, no.</i>

17:06.985 --> 17:10.780
If it's been recording this
whole time, we should keep it.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.116
You know,
as a memory for Chance

17:13.158 --> 17:16.619
so he can listen to the sounds
of his party

17:16.661 --> 17:19.622
and the <i>tías</i>talking.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.958
Shall we have a listen?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.169
- Oh, no, I don't--
<i>- Ay!</i>

17:31.217 --> 17:32.927
- I'm sorry.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.346
A-a spasm.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.264
I-it's the ghost of Raymundo.

17:36.306 --> 17:39.517
He still like to slap my ass
from the beyond.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.311

17:41.353 --> 17:43.188
Stop it, Ray!

17:47.233 --> 17:48.568

17:48.610 --> 17:50.612
You'd rather destroy
a $900 phone

17:50.653 --> 17:52.238
than admit that you called me
a hoochie?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.657
- I don't know what you're
talking about, Rosie.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.077
It was an accident.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.204
Can the Apple genie
fix it for me?

17:59.245 --> 18:00.455
- I don't know.

Let me ask.

he's ever been to.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.693
- It's the only banger
he's ever been to.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.277
But I'll take it.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.075
- About earlier...

18:37.117 --> 18:40.370
I'm sorry about letting
old stuff get in the way.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.872
It's really nice that you did
all that for Chance.

18:42.914 --> 18:46.209
- Well, Mayan, you know,
not all heroes wear capes.

18:46.251 --> 18:49.963
Some wear corduroy slippers
and knee-high white socks.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.884
- The higher the sock,
the downer the fool.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.970
- That's what's up.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.681
So I get why you were upset.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.683
- You do?
- Yeah.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.184
I felt the same way

19:03.226 --> 19:05.228
when my grandma was nice to you
when you were little.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.396
- Really?

19:06.438 --> 19:07.856
- Yeah, I mean, Mayan,

19:07.897 --> 19:09.399
I didn't have any birthday
parties or any gifts.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.401
I mean, my grandma said the
fact that I called her Grandma

19:11.443 --> 19:14.779
and that she fed me was a gift
that I didn't deserve.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.532
So I told her that I thought
calling her Grandma

19:17.574 --> 19:19.451
was a gift
that she didn't deserve.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.245
And she said, "Well, then
call me Doña Pow Pow."

19:23.872 --> 19:27.375
And the rest of
my formative years are blank.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.336
<i>Ay,</i>I got you something.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.601
Wait. This isn't a puppy.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.354
This is a very small,
very old dog.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.025
- Yeah, uh, it was a puppy
when you were 14.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.986
Don't squeeze it too hard

19:55.028 --> 19:56.988
because the filling
will come out like a churro.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.032
That should be
the dog's name, Mayan--Churro.

19:59.074 --> 20:02.118
- I think I get to name
my birthday puppy, thank you.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.037
- What are you going
to name it?

20:04.079 --> 20:06.623
- Churro.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.375
She even smells old.

20:34.359 --> 20:38.071
- Yeah, no need to be out
here doing the "chis-most."

20:38.113 --> 20:41.241
- I see you added some
white diversity to your coven.

Maybe you can sacrifice him
