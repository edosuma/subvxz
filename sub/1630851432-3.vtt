00:23.773 --> 00:27.402
This witch book your mom left you
is the coolest thing ever.

00:27.485 --> 00:31.322
Totally. And it would be even cooler
if I knew how to use it.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.909
-What does it all mean?

00:35.493 --> 00:37.287
Are these… recipes?

00:37.370 --> 00:41.833
If these are recipes, then I'm eating
microwave food for the rest of my life.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.835
Ew! Toad's tongue?

00:43.918 --> 00:46.588
And what is this? A dinosaur egg? Ugh.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.632
They must be the spells! But…

00:49.716 --> 00:52.177
How do we know how to do them?

00:55.555 --> 00:56.514
Truth-seers!

00:57.098 --> 00:58.224
That's what those are!

01:02.395 --> 01:07.233
"If people are not what they appear
Put these on to see who's near"

01:08.693 --> 01:10.236
I just see you guys.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.572
Can you see what I ate for breakfast?

01:12.655 --> 01:14.449
No. You're just you.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.368
Good. Because I totally ate your cupcake.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.289
Come on. Why don't you just try one spell?

01:21.372 --> 01:23.374
Um… Because I don't know how?

01:24.167 --> 01:26.377
Well, you're gonna have to learn
sooner or later.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.297
And the way those witches
have been coming after us,

01:29.380 --> 01:31.341
I'd say sooner rather than later.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.010
Please, can we just try one spell?

01:34.093 --> 01:36.554
Just one itsy-bitsy tiny spell?

01:37.138 --> 01:39.182
-Come on.
-Fine.

01:40.892 --> 01:44.687
"Apple trees talking… Wailing brown bats…"

01:44.771 --> 01:46.648
"Cotton candy clouds…"

01:46.731 --> 01:48.525
Oh! Hey, look!

01:49.108 --> 01:50.777
"Totally terrific talking toys!"

01:50.860 --> 01:52.237
That sounds fun.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.573
That guy! Hm…

01:55.657 --> 01:58.409
"Toy break free
And talk to me"

02:04.916 --> 02:07.085
I said talk, not dance.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.170
Come on, Willa! This is still cool.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.508
-Look at him go!
-Whoa!

02:32.110 --> 02:33.069
Look, try this.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.404
Hot, howling hair.

02:34.487 --> 02:38.032
Oh, I could die for a hair change.
Come on. Hit me, Willa.

02:41.369 --> 02:45.415
"Head of hair to make people stare
Thick and lush, shiny and fair"

02:45.498 --> 02:48.459
Yes, yes,
I want TV shampoo commercial hair!

02:53.381 --> 02:54.716
So, is it cute?

02:58.052 --> 03:00.889
I can tell by the way
you're staring at me that it's amazing.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.849
Lots of volume?

03:04.225 --> 03:07.896
Lots of volume is an understatement.

03:07.979 --> 03:13.443
And if lumberjacks are cute, then yeah!
Totally cute, right?

03:23.411 --> 03:28.458
Five piggies plus two piggies…

03:31.336 --> 03:34.505
And how are we today, Ms. Juniper?

03:35.089 --> 03:37.967
F-F-Fine. I-I-I think I'm fine.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.469
You look tired.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.512
Why don't you take the day off?

04:33.606 --> 04:38.778
Run on in here, huffin' and puffin'!
Willa Ward, get your muffin!

04:44.033 --> 04:45.285
What's on your mind, Willa?

04:46.828 --> 04:49.122
You ever just wonder
how you fit in in the world?

04:49.205 --> 04:50.290
What your purpose is?

04:50.873 --> 04:55.044
Well, that's the beauty of life's journey.
It unwinds as you go.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.588
-Unwinds?
-Yeah.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.466
I mean, the answers
just don't happen all at once.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.552
They come to you as you go along.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.431
You see, something might happen to you
and you don't know why,

05:06.514 --> 05:08.266
but then a second thing happens to you

05:08.349 --> 05:10.518
and you understand
why the first thing happened.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.229
The first thing happened
to prepare you for the second.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.607
So, first thing prepares you
for the second thing, second thing--

05:16.691 --> 05:18.276
You understand it all? Get it?

05:18.943 --> 05:20.069
Not really.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.195
Well, you will.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.824
I call it the magic of the journey.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.742
Beep!

05:27.702 --> 05:29.245
Hey! Morning girls.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.997
-What's the good word?
-Razor burn.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.834
-I think I have razor burn.
-Lucy.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.878
It was an accident. Let it go.

05:36.961 --> 05:40.882
Razor burn? Accident? W-W-What is this?

05:41.966 --> 05:43.968
Uh… See ya, Dad! Gotta go.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.804
-Bye!
-Anyone have any aftershave?

05:49.515 --> 05:50.767
Aftershave…

05:52.435 --> 05:53.686
Okay, lesson learned.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.230
My mom might have been a witch, but me?

05:56.314 --> 05:58.733
-No way, Jose.
-Willa!

05:58.816 --> 06:01.819
You can't just give up.
Why don't we ask Ms. Juniper?

06:01.903 --> 06:03.154
She's into witch stuff.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.948
-Yeah! Come on, Willa. Give it a chance.
-Give it a chance!

06:06.032 --> 06:07.700
-Come on!
-Yes! You know you want to.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.244
Okay…
I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.954
-Yeah!

06:15.917 --> 06:17.168
Uh, guys?

06:17.251 --> 06:18.753
I've got some bad news.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.047
-We have a substitute.
-Great.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.965
Now who'll help us figure this out?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.801
What if my beard comes back?

06:24.884 --> 06:25.760
Let it go.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.142
Hello!

06:33.226 --> 06:35.603
Early birds get the wormy-worm-worms.

06:35.686 --> 06:39.440
Come on in here!
Top of the fabulous morning to you.

06:39.524 --> 06:43.820
I'm the substitute, Mrs. Winkle… Pinkle.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.696
-Winkle Pinkle?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.032
What a weird name.

06:48.116 --> 06:52.495
According to Ancestry.com, we come
from a noble line of Winkle Pinkles,

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
from the county of Finkle Stinkle,

06:55.248 --> 06:59.168
in the northern region of
Dingle Bingle Lumber Bingle Boo.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.170
Ever heard of it?

07:01.254 --> 07:08.177
I was hoping some lovely little girls
such as you three would arrive early

07:08.261 --> 07:10.847
and show me around
this delightful classroom.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.267
-Um… Okay.

07:15.184 --> 07:19.188
Ms. Juniper keeps
all of her textbooks on this shelf, here.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.732
And she keeps her class pet Piggy in here.

07:21.816 --> 07:25.319
-Huh. That's odd. Where's Piggy?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.822
Uh, maybe she took him home with her.

07:27.905 --> 07:32.493
Sometimes animals need
a little extra love, like we all do.

07:38.040 --> 07:43.504
I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted
by that lovely necklace of yours, Willa.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.507
It's absolutely magical.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.926
-You can say that again.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.678
It was a gift from my mother.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.472
May I hold it?

08:00.688 --> 08:03.774
That's okay. I've waited a long time.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.569
I can wait a little longer. Hm!

08:07.487 --> 08:10.114
Come on in! Welcome to the classroom!

08:10.698 --> 08:13.367
Let the classroom begin.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.829
Is it just me,
or does this sub seem sub-human?

08:18.873 --> 08:21.292
Did you see how she was
drooling over your necklace?

08:22.126 --> 08:24.587
The look in her eyes was like… Like…

08:24.670 --> 08:28.090
Well! Aren't I just
the luckiest teacher around?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.928
The whole classroom full of… children.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.430
Isn't that what
all classrooms are full of?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.727
Okay, Miss Winkle Waddle Stinkle Pinkle.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.439
-Let's see who you really are.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.319
Lesson plans.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.703
Oh my goodness, these actually work!

08:58.663 --> 09:02.041
And that's no sub.
That's the witch, Wanda!

09:04.585 --> 09:07.588
I bet she got rid of Ms. Juniper
so she could get your amulet.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.006
And where's Ms. Juniper?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.800
She could be in danger.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.095
It seems like these witches
will stop at nothing to get my necklace.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.514
Excuse me children, is there a problem?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.934
I was about to start a show-and-tell.

09:20.434 --> 09:23.854
Perhaps you could
bring your necklace upfront, Willa,

09:23.938 --> 09:25.481
and show it to the class.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.776
Show-and-tell?
What are we, in kindergarten?

09:30.695 --> 09:34.657
Or easier yet,
you could hand it to me and I'll show it.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.287
After show-and-tell,
can we play musical chairs?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.084
-Go, go, go.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.295
Go! Come on, come on.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.970
Oh my goodness. Are you an actual witch?

09:56.053 --> 09:58.556
Have you heard of the, uh,
Three Witches of Winding Way?

09:58.639 --> 10:00.308
Now, they were such bad witches,

10:00.391 --> 10:03.019
and I'm not talking,
you know, bad like cool bad.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.397
Like, I'm talking, "I'll get you
and your little Toto, too" bad.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.568
So. Heh. Wait a minute,
you are a bad witch, right?

10:10.651 --> 10:13.446
I knew it the minute I saw you.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.240
Oh, wow. Am I in an actual witch's lair?

10:16.324 --> 10:19.535
No, actually. This is a storage room.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.247
-I have to admit, it is kind of homey.
-Okay.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.542
The way the spiderwebs
complement the black mold…

10:26.626 --> 10:27.460
Mm-hm.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.463
…in a subtle yet musty way.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.089
Yeah. Wow.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.009
A real-life witch,
in a real-life witch's storage room,

10:35.092 --> 10:36.719
and little old me! That's really--

10:36.802 --> 10:39.013
Do you always talk this much?

10:39.096 --> 10:42.350
Only when I'm excited.
I hate to ask this.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.853
It's a little embarrassing, but do
you think I could get a picture with you?

10:45.936 --> 10:50.274
Or I'd be totally fine with an autograph.
I know those are a little outdated, but…

10:50.358 --> 10:53.069
Wait a second. Why… Why am I here, anyway?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.278
Is this…

10:54.904 --> 10:56.697
-This is bad, right?

10:59.700 --> 11:02.370
I think they might be onto me.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.332
-Ugh! We need some new disguises.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.919
We need somebody the children trust.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.506
Right! Somebody every kid loves,
like a principal.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.091
Or a janitor!

11:15.174 --> 11:19.929
Witch, please. Something better,
like a… principal! Or a, or a janitor!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.348
I'm so brilliant.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.934
Five-letter word for principal.

11:25.017 --> 11:29.480
Must be S-M-A-R-T--

11:33.526 --> 11:37.988
I'll take care of the real deal.
You transform and meet me upstairs.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.741
-That amulet is as good as ours.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.369
Did I say I love my brilliant mind?
'Cause I do.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.580
-Boo.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.290
Still got it.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.796
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, those are
my students and that is my classroom.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.256
You do not go near them, okay?

11:55.339 --> 11:58.509
We just need to get something of ours
back from one of your students,

11:58.592 --> 12:02.304
so you just hang tight.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.974
Now, if you'll excuse me.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.058
Hey, Janitor Frank!

12:06.142 --> 12:08.978
Hey! Mornin' buddy!
Stay out of trouble!

12:16.444 --> 12:20.114
I need to head upstairs
to clean this mess up.

12:25.202 --> 12:29.290
That was so weird. We have to
get to my locker to get my witch book.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.208
-She wasn't even a good teacher.
-I know!

12:31.292 --> 12:36.172
Ah, sorry, ladies. This hallway is closed.
We had a water pipe break.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.383
But the floor looks totally dry.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.219
Exactly. That's why it's so dangerous.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.806
Anyway, to get out,
we have to detour this way.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.892
-So, after you.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.852
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.190
This way, girls. Right this way.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.985
Frank is acting…

12:59.195 --> 13:00.029
Weird.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.366
That's because
I don't think Frank is Frank.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.203
Okay, come on. Come on.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.538
Come on.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.208
-Almost there, come on.
-Move it!

13:12.791 --> 13:14.752
-Move along. Let's go.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.171
-Here we are. Right here. Here we go.
-It's Wilma!

13:17.254 --> 13:19.298
-Hiding potion, quick!
-Here.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.429
-Here we go. Right in--

13:25.513 --> 13:27.181
-Hey! What?
-Run!

13:27.264 --> 13:30.434
-No! Stop! Hey. Come back here.
-Get away from us, you phony!

13:30.518 --> 13:33.270
Get back here now! Come on. Wait up.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.108
-Girls, where are you?

13:38.192 --> 13:42.196
This isn't funny. Come on, come out.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.031
Where do we go for help now?

13:44.114 --> 13:46.784
Principal McKay!
Principals always know what to do.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.873
-Principal McKay!

13:54.250 --> 13:58.003
How did you girls get in here?
I didn't even hear you… or see you.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.549
That's us!
Just as quiet as cute little kittens.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.476
I mean…

14:12.560 --> 14:16.814
How can I help you, my… friends.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.775
Certain members of the faculty
aren't who they say they are.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.486
Hm! Troubling.
But before we deal with that,

14:22.570 --> 14:24.113
it seems you are in violation of

14:24.196 --> 14:26.198
Winding Way Middle School's
new dress code.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.450
Wait. There's a dress code now?

14:28.534 --> 14:31.287
Yes. No necklaces. Hand it over.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.247
There's a new dress code for necklaces?

14:33.330 --> 14:36.709
I saw a guy wearing Star Wars Birkenstocks
in the hallway today.

14:36.792 --> 14:37.626
How is that fair?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.588
Yeah, well, life's not fair, cupcake.
Hand it over, Willa Ward.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.634
-Come on.
-What about glasses?

14:46.218 --> 14:47.219
Are they allowed?

14:47.803 --> 14:51.599
Yes, yes. Glasses are fine.
Your necklace is fine.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.017
Just hand that over.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.020
-Sure thing, Principal McKay.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.189
Or should I say…

14:59.273 --> 15:01.233
-Principal Wanda Witch!
-I knew it!

15:04.820 --> 15:06.071
Busted.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.951
-Oh, there you are!
-Bad news.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.662
Turns out kids don't love janitors.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.625
Or principals.
But do you know who everyone loves?

15:18.459 --> 15:19.752
The substitute!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.881
Um, didn't they figure out
that you're the substitute?

15:24.798 --> 15:28.010
At least I got out of
that ridiculous tie. Come on!

15:31.764 --> 15:33.724
Okay. We need to chill.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.185
We just need a little more time
to unwind this mess.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.854
Unwind! That's it, Lucy!

15:39.647 --> 15:41.982
-My dad was right.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.817
This is all part of the journey.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.196
This book
was given to me for a reason.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.117
If we're going to save this school,
I've got some spells to cast.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.704
-It's time to fight back.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.377
Good! I love a good spell fight.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.673
You know, I just polished those floors
and you're scuffing them up.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.341
But tell you what:

16:07.424 --> 16:11.136
give me that book and your necklace
and we'll call it even.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.096
What do you say?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.687
Hiding potion, hiding potion, go!

16:30.155 --> 16:32.032
Great. The storage room.

16:32.116 --> 16:35.953
On the upside,
there's probably a lot of mice!

16:36.036 --> 16:37.538
Ew! Mice?

16:37.621 --> 16:41.125
Why did I just say that?
Must be my cat brain.

16:43.752 --> 16:44.586
Ms. Juniper?

16:44.670 --> 16:48.007
Um… Were you three just cats?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.551
-Uh… No.
-No.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.137
I knew you were a witch!

16:53.220 --> 16:56.682
Uh… We need your help.
They're trying to get my amulet.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.601
Okay, okay.
Well, can you untie me first, please?

16:59.685 --> 17:02.312
Now, you know,
I don't know much about magic.

17:02.396 --> 17:06.150
Well, couldn't you do something?
I mean, you were just a cat!

17:06.233 --> 17:10.237
I can't. Every time I try casting a spell,
I mess something up.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.199
Oh, okay. Well I have read about this.
This is classic beginner witch stuff.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.661
What you need to do is
believe in what you are saying.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.083
Oh, there you are, Willa!

17:23.167 --> 17:25.878
Playing hooky
from my class, I see!

17:27.337 --> 17:29.423
You thought you could run away from us?

17:33.552 --> 17:37.056
Give us the amulet, Willa.
We're not leaving until we get it.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.683
-Come on, let's make it easy.
-Okay, okay, stop!

17:39.767 --> 17:42.102
To get to the girls,
you'll have to go through me.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.812
-Okay!
-Alright.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.151
-Ms. Juniper! What do we do?

17:49.234 --> 17:50.861
Um, give them the amulet?

17:50.944 --> 17:52.988
No! It was my mom's.
They aren't getting it!

17:53.072 --> 17:58.160
So sad! Goody-two-shoes teacher
can't help her students.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.287
Or her little Piggy.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.122
Piggy? What about Piggy?!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.293
-Piggy!

18:06.376 --> 18:10.380
Alright. As I taught you in class,
words are only words unless you mean them!

18:12.716 --> 18:15.511
-That was really good.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.014
Head of hair to make people stare
Thick and lush, shiny and fair

18:22.726 --> 18:26.146
-Oh!
-Oh ho ho. Oh, you…

18:26.230 --> 18:27.523
I knew you could do it!

18:28.232 --> 18:29.775
Now you made us mad.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.027
Last time I did that spell
it made a huge beard!

18:32.111 --> 18:33.904
Well, A for effort, huh?

18:33.987 --> 18:35.781
Or a B for boring?

18:35.864 --> 18:37.616
Or D for done!

18:37.699 --> 18:40.994
-Okay, out you go. Go, go, go.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.455
Hey, fam.
Real-life chase with real-life witches.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.748
Hashtag blessed!

18:48.377 --> 18:50.712
We know you're in here somewhere.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.798
Oh no, we're cornered. Now what?

18:52.881 --> 18:55.843
You can run, but you can't hide!

18:55.926 --> 18:58.011
We could use
another spell right now, Willa.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.096
See, I can't do it!

18:59.179 --> 19:00.889
You can. You need to dig deep.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.058
Mean it. You've done it before.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.645
You know you can do it again.
You just have to keep believing.

19:11.817 --> 19:16.405
One way or another, Willa Ward,
you will give us that amulet.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.950
When you don't want your troubles near
Make them all disappear

19:27.791 --> 19:30.085
-We did it! We did it!

19:30.169 --> 19:31.962
Wisters doing it for themselves!

19:32.045 --> 19:34.548
-Oh, wait. What is that?

19:37.050 --> 19:38.552
-Piggy!
-Piggy!

19:40.137 --> 19:42.598
-Oh, Piggy.
-Piggy!

19:42.681 --> 19:45.267
Well, great work, everyone.

19:45.350 --> 19:49.188
I am honored to be a part of this and
even more honored to be your teacher.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.606
Thanks, Ms. Juniper.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.984
Does this mean you might be interested in
helping us out a little more?

19:55.277 --> 19:57.988
We sure could use
a grown-up who believes us.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.948
Oh! Well…

20:00.574 --> 20:03.202
As your teacher,
and a leading witchstorian…

20:04.494 --> 20:05.662
I would be thrilled.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.164
All in!

20:08.498 --> 20:10.500
Go wisters!

20:12.085 --> 20:16.089
Not to ruin a moment, but what exactly
did that spell do to the witches?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.846
How did they beat us again?!

20:25.557 --> 20:26.808
Oh, it pooped on you.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.903
-Hi, Frank.
-Principal McKay?

20:38.987 --> 20:40.113
Hello?

20:40.197 --> 20:43.992
-Hello? Help! Help!
-Help! Help! Help!

20:45.035 --> 20:47.913
-You don't know my first name, do you?
-Principal?

20:48.914 --> 20:50.958
-Help!
-Help!

21:02.010 --> 21:04.137
-Frank.
-Principal McKay.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.224
Have a great day.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.230
Dad.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.817
-I need to come clean with you.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.027
I think I might be…

21:20.612 --> 21:21.697
a witch.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.117
Ha! And I'm a warlock.
Let's go home, sweetheart.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.454
I have my famous witch's brew stew
going in the slow cooker.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.249
-You still don't believe me, do you?

21:32.833 --> 21:34.293
I believe in you.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.961
That counts, doesn't it?

21:36.461 --> 21:37.296
Kind of.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.464
Well, great! Let's go home.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.759
-You want to drive? Ha!

21:46.096 --> 21:51.810
Oh, I still can't believe those gremlin
girls managed to give us mustaches…

21:52.436 --> 21:56.773
But, you know, as mustaches go,
I am rather fond of the style.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.693
Time for the choppy-chop.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.903
Oh, your hand's shaking.
Why is it shaking?

22:01.987 --> 22:04.990
Do you want to lose
the loop-de-loop-de-loops, or not?

22:05.073 --> 22:06.742
Well, I just don't want to die.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.076
Aunts? You called for me.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.914
Well, dear nephew. How would you like
to fast-track your apprentice training?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.958
Oh my God, that would be so awesome!

22:15.042 --> 22:20.130
I mean, um, yes I'd be down.
Whatever. What do you need me to do?

22:20.213 --> 22:22.007
Well…

22:22.090 --> 22:24.926
You know that necklace
we were telling you about?

22:25.594 --> 22:29.639
-It's time for you to procure it.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.934
It would be my pleasure.
