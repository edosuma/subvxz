00:02.370 --> 00:05.980
[laughter]

00:06.020 --> 00:09.330
Yeah, and then he was like,
"I will look for you.

00:09.370 --> 00:11.330
"I will find you.

00:11.380 --> 00:13.470
And I will 'kall' you."

00:13.510 --> 00:14.770
That is such a good
Liam Neeson.

00:14.810 --> 00:15.770
Thank you.

00:15.810 --> 00:16.770
If he were
a drunk leprechaun.

00:16.820 --> 00:17.780
Hey!

00:17.820 --> 00:19.640
You could not do
better than that.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.080
I will look for you.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.820
Oh. Oh.

00:22.860 --> 00:24.340
I will find you.

00:26.000 --> 00:26.950
And I will kill you!

00:27.000 --> 00:27.960
Oh!

00:28.000 --> 00:29.960
Oh, hi, Fiona.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.260
I'm so sorry.

00:31.310 --> 00:32.790
We just saw this movie

00:32.830 --> 00:35.530
where Liam Neeson, like,
kills an entire country

00:35.570 --> 00:36.700
with his bare hands.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.270
Don't even bother
explaining.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.630
She doesn't like anything
that's fun and violent.

00:39.660 --> 00:40.840
Hey, we got
a single malt

00:40.880 --> 00:42.580
calling our name in there,
so let's go.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.580
Hey, no, I live alone.

00:44.630 --> 00:45.980
I know what it's like

00:46.020 --> 00:47.450
to have to take out the trash
by yourself at night.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.330
Well, this is actually compost
going in the worm hole, Liz.

00:50.370 --> 00:52.590
But thank you.
Point applies.

00:52.630 --> 00:55.720
Nice to have an empathetic
person around, Will, a human.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.330
You know what has made me
feel safer?

00:57.380 --> 00:58.510
Krav Maga.

00:58.550 --> 01:00.860
Yeah, it's Israeli
self-defense training.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.380
It's very empowering.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.340
Do you know, my friend Moishe
on the kibbutz,

01:04.380 --> 01:06.390
he was always trying to get me
to try Krav Maga,

01:06.430 --> 01:08.610
but I was always too busy
making the babka.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.350
You know, you could
come with me.

01:10.390 --> 01:11.520
Yeah, that'll be fun.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.450
I'll text you.
Will has your deets, right?

01:13.480 --> 01:14.920
[Will]
Yeah, totally.
I got her deets.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.920
And I'll get those
to you.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.180
You go get comfy.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.830
I'll go get those to you
right away, all right?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.010
Get cozy.

01:21.050 --> 01:22.180
Back off, babka.

01:22.230 --> 01:23.190
What?

01:23.230 --> 01:24.450
I like that girl
very much,

01:24.490 --> 01:25.930
and any time you get near
someone that I like,

01:25.970 --> 01:26.930
bad things happen.

01:26.970 --> 01:28.230
Well, I happen to like Liz,

01:28.280 --> 01:30.410
and despite her very
questionable taste in men,

01:30.450 --> 01:31.720
I'm going to hang out
with her.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.590
She's nice. So I'll give her
my deets myself.

01:33.630 --> 01:35.760
Fine, but if you
figure out a way,

01:35.810 --> 01:38.590
with your weird compost voodoo,
to ruin what I have going

01:38.640 --> 01:40.160
with that adorable girl
in there,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.160
I will look for ye.

01:42.210 --> 01:44.780
I will find ye.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.250
And I will kill ye.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.250
God, you sound like
the Lucky Charms fellow.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.600

My last text exchange
with Shea.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.030
I sent her

02:31.340 --> 02:32.430
Right, okay.

Sure, it is.

That initial frisson
we first felt

02:44.570 --> 02:46.920

it's fading, Will.

02:46.970 --> 02:48.320
Here's the deal.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.140
You just need to take Shea
on a great date, okay?

02:51.190 --> 02:52.750
The best date I ever went on,

02:52.800 --> 02:55.020
when Sam and I just really
started to connect,

02:55.060 --> 02:56.320
we were walking
by this fountain,

02:56.370 --> 02:58.580
and we ended up liberating
these pedal boats.

02:58.630 --> 02:59.590
Pedal boats!

02:59.630 --> 03:01.280
Is there no end
to your genius?

03:01.330 --> 03:02.280
No end.

03:02.330 --> 03:03.760
It's the perfect plan.

03:03.810 --> 03:06.720
I'm going to pedal up

03:18.690 --> 03:19.650
Okay, just be honest

03:19.690 --> 03:21.000
- with me here.
- Mm-hmm.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.700
Is 16 winky faces
too much?

03:22.740 --> 03:23.700
- Yes.
- You're right.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.570
- 17 it is.
- Okay.

03:27.010 --> 03:28.320
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:28.350 --> 03:30.920
So I have a favor...

03:30.970 --> 03:33.500
- Ooh!
- to ask you,

03:33.530 --> 03:36.800
and it's annoying and lame,
and I'm really sorry.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.320
Wow, annoying andlame.

to drive me wild with desire?

hang out with him

03:45.680 --> 03:46.760

Okay, I don't want to be
that girlfriend, but...

04:02.390 --> 04:04.350
earlier, you got
a little weird

04:04.390 --> 04:07.170
when Fiona and I were talking
about hanging out.

04:07.220 --> 04:08.350
And now you're picking
her kid's thing

04:08.390 --> 04:09.530
over my kid's thing.

04:09.570 --> 04:11.050
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Hold on.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.050
Hold on a second.

04:12.090 --> 04:13.620
Well, I mean,
you have to admit

kind of a--

No, she's strange.

No, but she and I
are totally normal.

can you do me up?

04:24.720 --> 04:27.510

Great.

All right, how is having
your girlfriend's son on my date

04:53.350 --> 04:54.610
a good thing?

04:54.660 --> 04:56.400
Listen, I can't be
a third wheel, all right?

04:56.440 --> 04:58.750
You need a fourth wheel
to balance the vehicle.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.450
Balance the vehicle?
Is that a thing?

05:01.490 --> 05:03.140
No, not really,
but just trust me.

05:03.190 --> 05:04.580
Don't worry. You won't
even know he's here.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.890
Ahoy.

05:07.930 --> 05:11.110
Me and my lady seek
your fittest plastic vessel.

05:11.150 --> 05:12.630
This one
should suffice.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.500
Be she polished
and seaworthy?

05:14.550 --> 05:17.160

no refunds.

optional?

05:20.420 --> 05:22.690

that could save your life?

Actually,
I'm--I'm good.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.780

you're gonna be okay.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.910
All right, first,
it's Marcus.

05:29.950 --> 05:32.910
And second of all,
you obviously haven't read

05:32.960 --> 05:34.780
the same safety blogs
my mom and I do.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.130
All right, guys,
listen up.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.180
There ain't no shame
in the safety game, all right?

05:38.220 --> 05:39.790

he's going to get a vest.

listening to?

a word you're saying.

asking questions.

though.

when'd you get that?

Oh, today with a Sharpie,

06:11.210 --> 06:12.470

06:12.520 --> 06:13.820
then I'm gonna get it
for real.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.480
Oh, you should go to my guy.
He's the best.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.740
Hey, just put your shirt down.
What's wrong with you?

06:17.780 --> 06:18.920
Marcus is about
to come back--

06:18.960 --> 06:20.180
Are you two lovebirds
going in or not?

06:20.220 --> 06:21.570
They're not lovebirds.
They just met.

06:21.610 --> 06:22.880
They're not together.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.400
Actually, we have a class
together--World Civ.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.750
She never shows up, so I--
- Hey, hey, hey.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.010
He's not writing
a book about you.

06:28.060 --> 06:29.020
I don't care what you care.

06:29.060 --> 06:30.490
You're holding up
my line.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.580
Oh, sir, no.
Wait, hold on.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.890

06:32.930 --> 06:34.760

Right, who's ready

06:34.800 --> 06:37.930
for a sensible balance
of fun and safety...

06:37.980 --> 06:40.720
Where's my lady going?

06:40.760 --> 06:42.550
All right, you got to look
on the bright side, buddy.

06:42.590 --> 06:44.380
You and I get
to go boating together.

do you?

06:48.550 --> 06:49.900
[Will]
All right, if Liam Neeson

06:49.950 --> 06:51.600
can jump out of a helicopter
into a powerboat,

06:51.640 --> 06:53.210
we should be able to get you
into that thing

one question.

06:57.430 --> 06:59.650
Why is the sky
so cloudy and dark?

06:59.700 --> 07:01.440
I thought the weather
was clear today.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.350
What are--

07:03.400 --> 07:04.840
- Whoa.
- What?

07:04.880 --> 07:06.670
You are having
a major allergic reaction.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.180
Your meds
are back in my car.

07:08.230 --> 07:09.360
It can't be.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.620
I haven't eaten anything

07:10.660 --> 07:12.400

this morning,

07:12.450 --> 07:13.490

07:13.540 --> 07:16.100
Unless...

07:16.150 --> 07:18.670
oh, latex.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.200
The devil's fabric!

07:20.240 --> 07:22.200
- Get it off me, Will!
- Whoa! Don't rock the boat!

07:22.240 --> 07:23.410
Get it off
before it's too late!

07:25.420 --> 07:26.370

Okay, your turn.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.510
Go ahead.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.550
Just give him a swift kick
to the throat.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.510
Trust me;
this feels amazing.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.910
- You got this.
- Okay, okay.

07:35.950 --> 07:36.910
Beep.

07:36.950 --> 07:38.260
Oh.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.300
I'm not very good at it.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.650
You know
what helps me?

07:40.690 --> 07:44.040
If I think of someone
I really despise.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.870
If I tell you who I picture,
do you promise not to judge me?

07:46.920 --> 07:48.400
Oh, yeah.
No, go on. Tell me.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.700
Okay.

07:49.750 --> 07:54.230
It's the mean moms
at school...

07:55.580 --> 07:58.450
Gossiping about
which mom brought

07:58.490 --> 08:01.280
the pepperoni pizza
to the bake sale.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
Well, you know what?

08:02.370 --> 08:03.500
That was me,

08:03.540 --> 08:06.850
because I work for a living,
Kaitlin!

08:06.890 --> 08:09.810
I salute you,
fellow warrior mother.

08:09.850 --> 08:10.850
Oh.

08:10.900 --> 08:11.850
Ah, okay.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.420
Got to work on my fiving.

08:13.470 --> 08:14.820
Yeah, I'll try that.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.380
I can't believe Will thought
something bad would come

08:16.420 --> 08:17.690
from us hanging out together.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.560
Well, he clearly
knows nothing.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.210
Well, I've been saying that
for a long time,

08:21.260 --> 08:23.090
although he never listens,
obviously.

08:23.130 --> 08:27.220
He's so arrogant and rude
and impossibly vain.

08:27.260 --> 08:28.480
And he never,

08:28.520 --> 08:31.180
ever, no matter how many times
I tell him,

08:31.220 --> 08:32.660
recycles!

08:34.570 --> 08:36.400
Anybody else?

08:36.440 --> 08:39.840
[Will]
All right, buddy, you're still
in the game here, all right?

08:39.880 --> 08:41.010
You just need to perk up
a little bit.

08:41.060 --> 08:42.750
Get your lady
a soft-serve ice cream,

08:42.800 --> 08:44.450
and take her on a little stroll
around the park.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.280
You know, Will,
I'm beginning to think

08:46.320 --> 08:48.590
you may have given me
the wrong allergy medicine.

08:48.630 --> 08:49.980
No, no, no,
double dose of blue,

08:50.020 --> 08:52.290
just like
your mom's song says.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.980
♪ Red is up, blue is down

08:54.030 --> 08:55.460
♪ Get them wrong,
and you will... ♪

08:55.510 --> 08:56.590
Oh! Frown.

08:56.640 --> 08:57.600
Marcus, are you okay?

08:57.640 --> 08:58.600
Oh, no.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.120
No, he's fine.
Yeah, he's--

09:00.160 --> 09:01.250
[Clay]
He looks awful, dude.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.310
He needs a nap.

09:02.340 --> 09:03.730
No, he's just
a little tuckered out

09:03.780 --> 09:05.470
for all the partying
he did last night.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.740
But he told me
he spent last night

09:06.780 --> 09:07.780
learning this new
knitting stitch

09:07.820 --> 09:09.170
called the cable
and twist.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.570
Oh, that's not
a knitting stitch.

09:10.610 --> 09:12.000
That's a dance move
from Japan.

09:12.050 --> 09:13.140
It's on YouTube.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.350
I'm surprised
you guys haven't seen it.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.620
You know, the arm thing?

09:15.660 --> 09:16.880
It's like a...
one of those things,

09:16.920 --> 09:17.880
and then--

09:17.920 --> 09:18.880
Marcus!

09:18.920 --> 09:20.310
Yeah, he's fine.
He's fine.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.400
Sometimes he gets a little--

09:21.450 --> 09:22.490
that's the end part
of the dance move,

09:22.530 --> 09:23.490
where you do the kneel.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.760
He was just getting into it.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.840
All right, guys, let's go
get some soft-serve.

09:26.890 --> 09:28.190
Right over there.
They got the good stuff.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.120
Here we go.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.330
Uh, bud, what flavor
are you gonna get?

09:32.370 --> 09:34.150
Blueberry?
Yeah, I like blueberry too.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.850
I'm gonna get chocolate
this time.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.640
Give me that.
You suck.

09:42.690 --> 09:44.170
I do not.
You suck.

09:44.210 --> 09:45.160
No, you suck.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.170
No, you suck.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.600
Hey, hey, hey,
guess what.

09:47.650 --> 09:48.990
You both suck, okay?

09:49.040 --> 09:50.390
Time to go, Shea.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.910
Hey, um...

09:53.960 --> 09:55.650
you know, we should
hang out again.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.000
I'll call you.

10:04.230 --> 10:06.190
What was that?
Did you just ask her out?

10:06.230 --> 10:08.880
'Cause she is spoken for
by this awesome little dude

10:08.930 --> 10:10.670
right here.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.150
You know what, Will?

10:12.190 --> 10:14.190
I'm gonna walk home
from here.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.460
Clay, I'm not done
with you.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.150
You--hey, don't put
your foot on--

10:18.200 --> 10:19.370
Hey, Clay?

10:19.420 --> 10:21.770
Yeah, you keep walking.

10:25.340 --> 10:28.730
Chin up, dude.

10:28.770 --> 10:29.990
Literally, man.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.040
Let's get that
thing closed.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.870
I have to say,
you could not be cooler,

10:36.910 --> 10:39.520
especially considering
what's going on

10:39.570 --> 10:41.790
with our kids right now.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.310
What is going on?

10:43.350 --> 10:44.530
Will didn't tell you?

10:44.570 --> 10:45.700
- No.
- Ugh.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.660
Well, apparently,
my son, Clay,

10:47.710 --> 10:49.270
tried to steal
Marcus's girlfriend.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.320
He is such a little
monster.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.150
- Did he?
- Yeah.

10:54.190 --> 10:55.500
You know, I bet
Will didn't tell you

10:55.540 --> 10:57.370
because he was afraid
you would, like,

10:57.410 --> 10:58.670
freak out or something.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.330
Why do guys
always do that?

11:00.370 --> 11:01.500
It's like just because
we're moms,

11:01.550 --> 11:03.460
we can't be
calm, rational people?

11:03.500 --> 11:04.640
That's ridiculous.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.640
I mean, I do feel
really bad,

11:06.680 --> 11:08.250
but what are you gonna do?

11:08.290 --> 11:09.990
Kids will be kids, right?

11:10.030 --> 11:11.160
Unless you want to be

11:11.210 --> 11:13.640
one of those insane
helicopter moms

11:13.690 --> 11:17.600
who is afraid to let her child
feel a moment's disappointment.

11:17.650 --> 11:19.560
- Yeah, God forbid that, though.
- Mm-hmm.

11:19.610 --> 11:21.430
That would be crazy,
wouldn't it?

11:21.480 --> 11:23.790
I mean, and we're
not crazy, are we?

11:23.830 --> 11:24.790
[chuckles]

11:24.830 --> 11:25.830
Are we?

11:33.190 --> 11:35.750
Coffee, please.
Thank you.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.760
Oh, hey, Shea.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.450
Hey, I have homework to do,

11:39.500 --> 11:41.450
so I'm not really
in the mood to talk.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.630
Oh, me neither.
I hate talking.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.510
No...I'm just here
for the coffee.

11:45.550 --> 11:46.940
I love it here.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.250
Really?
Coffee's terrible here.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.460
All right, fine, look.

11:51.510 --> 11:56.430
Shea, I'm here to stop you
from making a huge mistake.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.780
You don't know
what you're talking about.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.260
Shea, let me just--

12:02.300 --> 12:03.780
just answer me
one question, okay?

12:03.830 --> 12:06.440
What does this--what does
this Clay kid have

12:06.480 --> 12:08.700
that Marcus doesn't?

12:08.740 --> 12:11.790
I--I don't know.

12:11.830 --> 12:16.100
It's just, he's into
all the same stuff that I am.

12:16.140 --> 12:18.400
And...

12:18.450 --> 12:21.060
Marcus is--he's just
still such a kid.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.410
Yeah, I mean, I hear you.
I hear you.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.280
You know, he may be
on the sheltered side.

12:25.330 --> 12:28.080
You know, and he may still
occasionally nap with a blankie.

12:28.110 --> 12:29.370
He naps with a blankie?

12:29.420 --> 12:31.640
Scratch that.
I never said that, okay?

12:31.680 --> 12:33.810
Look, there are so many
cooler guys in the world

12:33.860 --> 12:35.730
than Marcus, all right?

12:35.770 --> 12:40.430
But, Shea, there is no one

12:40.470 --> 12:45.950
with a bigger, sweeter heart

12:46.000 --> 12:52.130
and a goofier, braver spirit
than Marcus.

12:52.180 --> 12:54.270
And I will take that

12:54.310 --> 12:57.660
over that polished act
Clay's got any day.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.280
[Fiona]
Um, excuse me.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.840
[loud music in headphones]

13:05.890 --> 13:07.450
Oi!

13:09.330 --> 13:10.670
Those precious to you,
are they?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.110
Uh, yeah.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.910
Well, I'd like you to imagine
what it would feel like

13:14.940 --> 13:17.070
to have something
that you cared about deeply

13:17.120 --> 13:18.600
ripped out of your hands,

13:18.640 --> 13:20.470
'cause then you'll understand
how my son feels.

13:20.510 --> 13:24.120
Okay, look, Mrs...
Will's neighbor.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.080
Um, I didn't rip
anyone away, okay?

13:27.130 --> 13:30.260
I'm not sure you get
how liking someone works.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.650
Oh, you're not sure
I get that.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.000
Mm-hmm. Well.
[clears throat]

13:34.050 --> 13:36.090
I would just like you
to consider

13:36.140 --> 13:38.630
the karmic implications
of your actions,

13:38.660 --> 13:40.660
because did you know
the Buddha teaches

13:40.710 --> 13:44.500
that for every selfish act,
a seed of pain is planted

13:44.540 --> 13:47.420
inside your consciousness
that will one day blossom

13:47.450 --> 13:49.410
into a great big tree
of suffering?

13:49.450 --> 13:51.980
Uh, yeah, my tree's good.

13:52.020 --> 13:53.460
Really?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
[muttering]
...not having those...

13:55.550 --> 13:57.810
Those are mine.
Give those back.

13:57.850 --> 13:59.590
Promise me that you won't
steal Shea. Promise!

13:59.640 --> 14:00.640
You're crazy.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.470
I have not begun
to bring the crazy.

14:02.510 --> 14:05.030
Basketball's not
your sport, is it?

14:08.340 --> 14:10.040
Ladies.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.790
Hey, we have
a situation.

14:17.830 --> 14:19.310
Oh, yeah, we have
a situation.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.220
You allowed
your girlfriend's son

14:21.270 --> 14:23.700
to ruin Marcus's date
and probably his life.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.010
Okay, the important thing is,

14:25.050 --> 14:26.270
I am doing something
about it, all right?

14:26.320 --> 14:27.360
Well, I'm doing something
about it.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.360
I've done something about it.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.460
[knocking at door]Bloody hell.

14:29.490 --> 14:30.450
Listen, stay right there.

14:30.490 --> 14:31.970
I am not done with you.

14:32.020 --> 14:34.670
[knocking continues]

14:34.720 --> 14:35.990
- [groans]
- Hi.

14:36.020 --> 14:36.980
What were you thinking,

14:37.020 --> 14:38.240
accosting my kid
at school today?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.760
I didn't accost him.

14:39.810 --> 14:40.980
We were having
a conversation.

14:41.030 --> 14:42.940
- Oh, Come in.
- Well, because he told me

14:42.990 --> 14:45.610
that you stole his headphones

14:45.640 --> 14:48.640
and then you threatened
to "bring the crazy"?

14:48.690 --> 14:50.080
Yeah, well, that's just
Cockney rhyming slang

14:50.120 --> 14:51.120
for...something.

14:51.170 --> 14:52.430
For what?

14:52.470 --> 14:53.860
Well, nothing that you'd
understand, actually.

14:53.910 --> 14:55.340
And you know what?
I did accost him.

14:55.390 --> 14:56.950
I did.
But he started it.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.780
Wow, I cannot believe
I thought you were cool.

14:59.830 --> 15:00.960
I am cool.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.480
Hey, guys,
what are you talking about?

15:02.530 --> 15:04.180
And of course you're here,

15:04.220 --> 15:05.700
at your neighbor's house,
mm-hmm.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.180
Are you aware that she basically
mugged my child today?

15:08.230 --> 15:10.360
What?
I did not mug your child.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.580
I confiscated his headphones,
and he deserved it.

15:13.620 --> 15:14.930
Remember when I was telling you

15:14.970 --> 15:16.500
how whenever you get near
someone I like--

15:16.540 --> 15:18.240
what was it, good things happen
or bad things happen?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.240
I forget.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.890
I was just protecting
my son.

15:20.940 --> 15:24.030
Yeah, by butting into something
that had nothing to do with you.

15:24.070 --> 15:25.330
What?

15:25.380 --> 15:27.040
Kids need to make
their own mistakes, you know.

15:27.070 --> 15:29.030
That's the only way
they learn anything.

15:29.070 --> 15:30.290
Two women,
two parenting styles.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.380
I think we should agree
to disagree

15:31.420 --> 15:32.860
and go get some cookies.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.990
That is the most facile,
tiger motherish thing to say.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.560
You know why your son
doesn't need protecting?

15:37.600 --> 15:38.780
- Why?
- 'Cause he's the bully.

15:38.820 --> 15:41.220
Oh, that's interesting,
coming from a woman

15:41.260 --> 15:44.050
who threatens a child
half her size.

15:44.090 --> 15:45.130
Oh, oh, oh!
We're going to do

15:45.180 --> 15:46.570
the tall girl jokes now,
are we?

15:46.610 --> 15:48.440
Well, hey,
if the gigantic shoe fits...

15:48.490 --> 15:49.580
Get ready!

15:49.620 --> 15:51.570
Oh, you watch yourself.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.230
I am a Krav Maga
level seven.

15:53.270 --> 15:54.750
Well, I am a Mama Bear
level eight.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.330
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

15:56.360 --> 15:59.020
As much as I would like
to watch you guys go at it

15:59.060 --> 16:00.240
and tear
each other's clothes off,

16:00.280 --> 16:01.580
just get in there, ah,

16:01.630 --> 16:04.720
I need you to relax
and chill!

16:07.290 --> 16:09.590
- Ooh!
- Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

16:09.640 --> 16:11.990
Yeah, I was trying to tell you
that I talked to Shea

16:12.030 --> 16:13.600
and I think I really may have
gotten through to her.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.550
Well, do you think she'll change
her mind about dumping him?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.860
I do!

16:16.900 --> 16:19.210
Ugh, this is the strangest
relationship ever.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.090
Will, Mom!

16:21.130 --> 16:22.820
Clay's mom.

16:22.870 --> 16:25.040
I don't know what happened
while I was unconscious,

16:25.090 --> 16:26.260
but it must have been
pretty good,

16:26.310 --> 16:27.880
because I just got
a text from Shea

16:27.920 --> 16:29.840
saying,
"We need to talk."

16:31.220 --> 16:33.490
I owe it all to you, Will.

16:35.450 --> 16:37.850
That's what "we need
to talk" means?

16:37.880 --> 16:38.930
Are you sure?

16:38.970 --> 16:40.540
So sorry, buddy.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.190
Look, you know,
all I can say is,

16:42.230 --> 16:44.540
I've been in your shoes,
and it's just--

16:44.580 --> 16:46.370
You've had the girl
you're crazy about

16:46.410 --> 16:47.760
leave you for somebody else?

16:49.760 --> 16:52.550
N-no, not exactly.

16:52.590 --> 16:55.070
But, you know, there have been
things that I've wanted

16:55.120 --> 16:57.160
- that I haven't gotten--
- She's not some new iPhone

16:57.210 --> 16:58.860
there's a waiting list for.

17:00.510 --> 17:06.430
She's my heart and my soul
and...

17:08.740 --> 17:10.870
She's here.

17:14.220 --> 17:16.400
"She walks in beauty,
like the night

17:16.440 --> 17:19.750
"of cloudless climes
and starry skies.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.400
"And all that's best
of dark and bright

17:22.450 --> 17:25.060
meet in her aspect
and her eyes."

17:25.100 --> 17:27.580
That was so beautiful, man.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.590
Is that John Mayer?

17:29.630 --> 17:32.200
Lord Byron,
you handsome dummy.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.850
[sighs]

17:33.890 --> 17:37.460
Well, I guess this is it.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.810
Got to go have the talk
with her.

17:39.860 --> 17:41.160
Listen.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.560
If you need help,
I'll go down there with you.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.780
No.

17:45.820 --> 17:50.390
I need to do this one on my own.

17:50.430 --> 17:51.610
[sighs]

17:54.830 --> 17:58.790
Hey, you--you said
you wanted to talk?

17:58.830 --> 18:01.230
FYI, I just found out
what that means.

18:01.270 --> 18:02.750
Yeah, uh...

18:02.790 --> 18:06.140
God, this is so hard.

18:06.190 --> 18:08.800
Have you--have you read
the Fire Be With Mebooks?

18:08.840 --> 18:10.230
I have not.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.280
Well, um,

18:11.320 --> 18:13.760
there's this sorceress,
Meeha,

18:13.800 --> 18:17.760
and she--she has
this awful decision to make.

18:17.810 --> 18:21.070
She has to choose between Kade,
the man-wolf,

18:21.120 --> 18:23.290
and Soren,
the wind whisperer.

18:23.340 --> 18:25.610
Yeah, I'm just gonna take
a wild guess

18:25.640 --> 18:29.170
that in this analogy,
I am not the man-wolf.

18:29.210 --> 18:31.170
And the thing is,

18:31.210 --> 18:33.480
she really likes
the both of them,

18:33.520 --> 18:35.610
just in different ways.

18:35.650 --> 18:39.180
And she goes back and forth
for, like, hundreds of years.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.660
That's--that's kind of
how I feel.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.660
I like you.
I really do.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.530
But I--I also like
somebody else,

18:48.580 --> 18:51.280
and it's really confusing.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.320
Does that make sense?

18:53.370 --> 18:54.510
Not really.

18:54.540 --> 18:57.890
I mean, you're my favorite.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.510
I'd never go back and forth
about you.

19:00.550 --> 19:03.510
Marcus, that's what makes this
really hard.

19:03.550 --> 19:04.900
You're just so sweet.

19:04.940 --> 19:07.200
I get it.

19:07.250 --> 19:10.120
You don't feel
the same way that I do,

19:10.170 --> 19:12.480
and you feel too bad
about hurting me

19:12.520 --> 19:15.740
to come out and say it,
so I've got to say it for you.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.520
Good-bye, Shea.

19:20.570 --> 19:23.390
It was brief,
but it was beautiful.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.050
Thanks for letting me
get to know you.

19:27.090 --> 19:30.580
You turned out even greater
than I thought you would.

19:33.010 --> 19:35.450
And I thought you'd be
pretty great.

Oh, darling, I do know
exactly how you feel.

19:57.730 --> 20:01.260
It's like you're in
a tidal wave of heartbreak

20:01.300 --> 20:02.260
that is threatening
to sweep you

20:02.300 --> 20:04.260
into an ocean of grief.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.830
I--I think what your mom
is trying to say is,

20:06.870 --> 20:09.750
you know, you kept
your dignity, man,

20:09.790 --> 20:11.790
and we're just so proud
of you for that.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.370
What good is my dignity?

20:14.400 --> 20:17.270
Can my dignity hold my hand
on my way to school?

20:17.320 --> 20:18.360
[crying]
No!

20:18.410 --> 20:20.410
Can my dignity kiss me
four times?

20:20.450 --> 20:21.930
No, darling.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.290
You only kissed her
four times?

20:23.330 --> 20:24.900
Would you shut up?

20:24.940 --> 20:26.950
I'm sorry, but he--
he was going out with her

20:26.980 --> 20:28.290
for, like, months.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.810
I may have missed her lips
a couple times,

20:30.850 --> 20:32.160
caught some earlobe instead.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.810
Well, that's still face,
man, so that counts.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.470
You know, Will,
the only beacon of light

20:37.510 --> 20:41.340
shining in the black sea of
despair that is my heart

20:41.390 --> 20:45.130
is knowing that I'm not
the only one who'll be alone.

20:45.170 --> 20:46.300
That's right.

20:46.350 --> 20:47.610
That's a really good way
of looking at it.

20:47.650 --> 20:49.440
Your mom is all alone too.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, thank you
for bringing that up

20:52.050 --> 20:53.530
right now, Will.

20:53.570 --> 20:55.440
No, I meant you, Will.

20:55.490 --> 20:57.230
As my best friend,
there's no way

20:57.270 --> 20:58.490
you could continue going out

20:58.530 --> 21:01.230
with the mother
of my sworn enemy.

[crying]

Darling, little bear,

21:05.320 --> 21:08.330
it's all right;
Mummy's here.

21:08.370 --> 21:11.070
I'm gonna go
warm up this tea here.
