[Children laughing]

00:06.171 --> 00:08.407
[Indistinct chatter]

00:11.509 --> 00:14.446
Garcia: Oh. Thank you for picking me up.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.315
Yeah. Of course.

00:16.347 --> 00:18.350
Oh, I don't know how long
Esther's gonna be in the shop.

00:18.384 --> 00:20.486
The mechanic, she says they
have to get a special part

00:20.518 --> 00:22.354
from California because, you
know, Esther runs on biodiesel,

00:22.388 --> 00:23.756
but when that part is inside Esther,

00:23.789 --> 00:25.358
she's gonna run like a dream.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.392
She might run for another 100,000 miles.

00:27.425 --> 00:29.261
Isn't this place great?

00:29.295 --> 00:30.496
It is. Yeah. I've
never been here before,

00:30.528 --> 00:32.164
but I ordered exactly what you told me.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.499
Yes! Usually, I'm a tea gal,

00:33.531 --> 00:35.167
but their nitro cold
brew here is everything.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.368
Woman: Order for Emily.

00:36.402 --> 00:37.536
Oh. This is us.

00:36.402 --> 00:37.536
Ooh!

00:37.570 --> 00:38.804
Uh, question.

00:38.838 --> 00:40.673
Did you watch the show last night?

00:40.706 --> 00:42.275
No. I'm behind.

00:42.307 --> 00:43.408
Spoiler alert. May I?

00:43.442 --> 00:45.344
- Go ahead.
- Ok. The blond one,

00:45.377 --> 00:47.780
she died twice last week!

00:47.813 --> 00:49.715
It was crazy with a "K"!

00:49.747 --> 00:51.416
All right. So there
was that battle, right,

00:51.450 --> 00:52.852
and they needed her to
have a secret identity.

00:52.884 --> 00:54.786
Well, after that race car thing,

00:54.820 --> 00:56.456
and then this week, she's back at work.

00:56.488 --> 00:58.323
Wait. She's already back at work?

00:58.356 --> 01:00.259
Yes, because she has special
healing powers, remember?

01:00.292 --> 01:01.627
She gets back to work, and she professes

01:01.659 --> 01:03.795
her undying love to her boss Steffi,

01:03.829 --> 01:05.430
and I, like, screamed,

01:05.462 --> 01:07.733
"they're gonna do that now? Now?"

01:07.766 --> 01:10.169
I mean, she has loved
her for years and years.

01:10.201 --> 01:11.536
Remember that one case they had,

01:11.569 --> 01:12.838
and they went on the date afterwards...

01:12.871 --> 01:14.272
Not a date. It was a
non-date date, but still...

01:14.305 --> 01:15.841
And then Sergio, he puked up a fur ball

01:15.875 --> 01:17.609
on some clean laundry
because he's diabolical,

01:17.643 --> 01:18.878
but you're here, and I'm here,

01:18.911 --> 01:20.546
and it's a beautiful
Wednesday morning...

01:20.578 --> 01:23.548
Penelope, that isn't
your first coffee, is it?

01:23.581 --> 01:26.251
Well, it doesn't count
if you brew it yourself.

01:26.284 --> 01:28.753
I'm cutting you off now.

01:28.787 --> 01:30.323
Fair play.

[Sighs]

01:56.882 --> 01:58.350
[Knock on door]

01:58.384 --> 01:59.552
Morning. Hey.

01:59.584 --> 02:01.286
Another day, another dollar.

02:01.319 --> 02:03.388
Yep. Good old-fashioned
government dollar.

02:03.421 --> 02:06.424
I can tell Garcia hit up
her favorite coffee truck

02:06.457 --> 02:07.626
on her way to work.

02:07.659 --> 02:09.662
I had to cut her off.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.763
Wait. Don't you have a
budget meeting this morning?

02:11.796 --> 02:13.733
Uh, yes, I do.

02:13.765 --> 02:15.433
Emily.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.837
Yeah?

02:17.870 --> 02:19.805
You buried the lede.

02:19.837 --> 02:21.573
Flowers?

02:21.606 --> 02:24.342
That Andrew Mendoza's a keeper.

02:24.376 --> 02:27.646
Mm-hmm.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.716
- Can't be late for that meeting.
- Mm-hmm.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.387
Man: This fiscal year, the bureau saw

02:34.419 --> 02:37.489
a $46 million reduction.

02:37.522 --> 02:39.959
The BAU was first
against all other units

02:39.991 --> 02:43.328
in direct and indirect
costs for your travel.

02:43.361 --> 02:45.531
I think unit chief
Prentiss can better speak

02:45.563 --> 02:47.500
to their needs.

02:47.532 --> 02:49.634
Yes, of course.

02:49.668 --> 02:53.573
Uh, this fiscal year, the
BAU's costs have increased...

03:04.582 --> 03:06.419
Man: Prentiss.

03:06.451 --> 03:08.888
You have a second to go over
with requests with the director?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.455
- Absolutely.
- Maybe grab some lunch.

03:10.489 --> 03:12.290
I know he's been wanting
to speak with you.

03:12.324 --> 03:13.593
I'd love to.

03:15.026 --> 03:16.561
- I thought that went well.
- Yeah!

03:16.594 --> 03:18.296
Do you think she'll
get to school on time?

03:18.330 --> 03:19.665
It's not far, right?

03:19.698 --> 03:21.234
No. They'll make it.

03:21.266 --> 03:22.567
Kara's a great kid.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.403
Her foster mom's taking
really good care of her.

03:25.437 --> 03:27.439
She adores you.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.408
Becoming an uncle 5 years
ago was a big surprise,

03:29.441 --> 03:32.478
but now, man, I can't
imagine my life without her.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.213
You're gonna be a great dad.

03:36.481 --> 03:39.852
Thanks. Um, how long
does this usually take?

03:39.884 --> 03:44.556
A while, so just hang in there.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.758
Brenda, I can't thank you enough.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.325
It's my pleasure.

03:47.359 --> 03:48.628
- I'll be in touch.
- Great.

03:53.564 --> 03:55.734
Oh. You're following me now.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.302
It's so awkward when this happens

03:57.336 --> 03:58.471
because we already said good-bye.

03:58.503 --> 03:59.838
No. I get it. You wanted to spend

03:59.872 --> 04:01.040
a few extra minutes with me.

04:01.073 --> 04:02.540
You could have just asked, Sean.

04:02.574 --> 04:04.277
Oh. I wish I had the time, but actually,

04:04.310 --> 04:06.344
I'm running late for a meeting.

04:06.377 --> 04:07.979
Maybe next time.

04:08.013 --> 04:09.715
- This is me.
- Oh.

04:09.747 --> 04:11.550
- Bye, Sean.
- Bye.

04:31.336 --> 04:32.639
[Car starts]

04:43.682 --> 04:46.319
[Liquid gushing]

05:02.800 --> 05:04.803
Everything is wrong!

05:04.836 --> 05:08.440
Everything you know is wrong...

05:08.473 --> 05:09.841
And this is proof!

05:13.612 --> 05:16.349
Pretty gruesome stuff.

05:16.382 --> 05:19.617
Yeah. This is the third
killing in the last two months?

05:19.651 --> 05:21.520
Yes. The Denver division invited us in.

05:21.552 --> 05:23.555
They've got 3 men dead.

05:23.588 --> 05:24.824
Each was decapitated.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.125
Heads nowhere to be found.

05:26.158 --> 05:27.959
Garcia: The first two were killed
in public yet secluded areas,

05:27.992 --> 05:30.562
one on a bike path, the other at a park.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.497
This the first time this
guy's left a message?

05:32.531 --> 05:34.100
Prentiss: Yeah. Nothing like this
was found at the other crime scenes.

05:34.132 --> 05:35.700
Garcia: Yeah, and
speaking of this message,

05:35.733 --> 05:37.603
it was filmed on the victim's phone,

05:37.636 --> 05:38.737
so there's no way to track it.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.139
The unsub's not afraid of being seen.

05:40.172 --> 05:41.607
We should take the partial
we have of his face,

05:41.639 --> 05:43.041
run it through ViCAP,
and see if it hits.

05:43.074 --> 05:44.944
And what did he mean by
"everything you know is wrong"

05:44.976 --> 05:47.112
and this is proof"?

05:47.146 --> 05:48.146
Proof of what?

05:48.180 --> 05:51.516
Power, control, his
dominance over the victims.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.619
Well, his word choice plus
that head, it feels like a taunt

05:53.651 --> 05:55.454
directed at he viewer, not the victim.

05:55.487 --> 05:57.088
If it was a taunt directed
at the general public,

05:57.122 --> 05:58.790
he would have uploaded it somewhere.

05:58.824 --> 06:00.158
Then it must be law enforcement.

06:00.192 --> 06:01.860
Either way, the distinct lack of empathy

06:01.894 --> 06:03.129
and remorse in his voice

06:03.161 --> 06:04.596
plus his general demeanor

06:04.629 --> 06:06.031
and the nature of his crimes tells us

06:06.064 --> 06:07.533
that he's an organized offender

06:07.565 --> 06:08.800
with a specific psychopathology.

06:08.861 --> 06:10.931
One that includes taking
his victim's heads.

06:10.964 --> 06:12.633
Nothing here says he's
close to being done.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.435
Wheels up in 10.

06:22.808 --> 06:24.544
Denver, huh?

06:24.578 --> 06:26.546
Yeah.

06:26.580 --> 06:29.515
Mendoza call you directly?

06:29.549 --> 06:32.419
Uh, no actually. It came
through official channels.

06:32.452 --> 06:35.856
So... You and Andrew long distance...

06:35.888 --> 06:37.557
How's that been going?

07:02.416 --> 07:04.885
Voice: Kyle!

07:04.917 --> 07:06.553
You're getting closer.

Synced and corrected by <font color="#800000">deglinglau</font>
www.addic7ed.com

07:45.664 --> 07:47.866
Prentiss: "History has a
way of altering villains"

07:47.899 --> 07:50.969
so that we can no longer
see ourselves in them."

07:51.001 --> 07:53.390
Adam Serwer.

07:53.571 --> 07:55.006
Go ahead, Garcia.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.609
Garcia: Ok, fam. We got
dossiers on top of dossiers.

07:57.642 --> 07:59.044
Our first victim is Manny Rodriguez...

07:59.077 --> 08:01.113
Late thirties, divorced, no kids.

08:01.145 --> 08:02.922
He was a twice-elected
city councilperson.

08:03.726 --> 08:06.929
Politics can be messy. He may
have ruffled some feathers.

08:06.963 --> 08:08.799
Jareau: Perhaps, but our second victim

08:08.831 --> 08:10.701
Isaac Wiley was in his late 20s.

08:10.733 --> 08:12.335
He worked for a tech firm.

08:12.369 --> 08:13.670
There's nothing in his file

08:13.703 --> 08:15.305
that could be considered controversial

08:15.338 --> 08:15.948
or political.

08:16.048 --> 08:18.624
Our latest victim Sean
Mcafee was an architect,

08:18.624 --> 08:21.053
early 30s, single,
never married, no kids.

08:21.087 --> 08:22.723
So all 3 had different jobs

08:22.755 --> 08:24.357
and lived in different parts of town.

08:24.390 --> 08:27.294
Alvez: Garcia, have you
found any overlap socially?

08:27.327 --> 08:29.729
Do I have to start
calling you newbie again?

08:29.762 --> 08:32.732
Ok. So you would have led with that.

08:32.765 --> 08:34.166
Shut the front door.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.736
Andrew Mendoza signed this report.

08:36.769 --> 08:39.205
Andrew Mendoza is Prentiss' boyfriend.

08:39.238 --> 08:41.073
He's the head of the
Denver field office?

08:41.107 --> 08:45.846
Uh, yes. He has been for
the past, uh, two months.

08:45.878 --> 08:48.080
Um, his daughter and ex-wife moved

08:48.113 --> 08:49.383
to Colorado a year ago,

08:49.416 --> 08:51.017
and he'd been waiting for a transfer

08:51.051 --> 08:52.786
so he could be closer to Keely.

08:52.819 --> 08:54.822
She starts high school soon, so...

08:58.057 --> 09:01.260
Alvez: But you guys
are, um... you're good?

09:01.293 --> 09:03.663
Yeah. Yeah. It's all good.

09:03.696 --> 09:05.731
Anyway, we have bigger fish to fry

09:05.764 --> 09:07.734
than my personal life, so when we land,

09:07.767 --> 09:09.268
Simmons, Rossi, and I will set up

09:09.301 --> 09:10.202
at the Denver division.

09:10.237 --> 09:14.007
JJ, Reid, check out
the latest crime scene.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.843
Tara and Luke, you will
go to the M.E.'s office.

09:16.876 --> 09:18.145
Garcia: So we're just not gonna talk

09:18.177 --> 09:20.080
about that tall hunk of
water you call your bae?

09:20.113 --> 09:21.113
No.

09:21.147 --> 09:22.081
I have so many questions.

09:22.114 --> 09:24.216
Like, is he left-handed?
What does he sleep in?

09:24.249 --> 09:25.184
Is he allergic to cats?

09:25.218 --> 09:26.319
Prentiss: Bye, Penelope.

09:26.352 --> 09:27.721
Was he ever in band?

09:35.261 --> 09:38.432
Hey. I got to go, all right?

09:38.464 --> 09:40.300
Dave, good to see you.

09:40.333 --> 09:41.101
Same here.

09:41.133 --> 09:42.402
- How you doing?
- How are you, brother?

09:42.435 --> 09:44.171
- Good to see you.
- You, too. You, too.

09:44.204 --> 09:45.405
And Chief Prentiss.

09:45.437 --> 09:48.374
Oh, hi. Yeah.

09:48.407 --> 09:50.877
Andrew, uh, what have you got for us?

09:50.910 --> 09:52.945
Well, first off, we got
you guys set up over here,

09:52.979 --> 09:54.848
and waiting to be interviewed are

09:54.881 --> 09:56.450
the friends and family
of the first two victims.

09:56.483 --> 09:59.118
Also a woman named Alice
Clarke is coming in.

09:59.152 --> 10:01.455
She's the last known person
to speak to Sean Mcafee.

10:01.488 --> 10:04.023
Great. We'll just need
a few minutes to set up.

10:04.056 --> 10:05.926
All right.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.294
Hey.

10:09.061 --> 10:11.197
I missed you.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.832
It's good to see you.

10:12.865 --> 10:15.234
Uh-huh. Think we need to talk.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.937
We will when the case is over.

10:23.276 --> 10:25.045
Jareau: All right. Thanks.

10:25.078 --> 10:27.180
So, uh, neighbors reported seeing

10:27.213 --> 10:29.216
an older Ford station wagon in the area.

10:29.248 --> 10:30.816
Hopefully we can get plates.

10:30.849 --> 10:33.295
Did you see the additional
home surveillance?

10:33.295 --> 10:34.887
I did. I just watched all the footage.

10:34.921 --> 10:36.189
Hopefully, the extra
angles can help Garcia

10:36.221 --> 10:37.890
with her facial recognition search.

10:37.924 --> 10:39.426
Sean had cameras all over his house,

10:39.459 --> 10:41.328
but based on the unsub's behavior,

10:41.360 --> 10:42.395
he had no idea he was being filmed.

10:42.429 --> 10:44.297
That means the unsub
probably wasn't stalking him.

10:44.330 --> 10:46.133
This was all impulse.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.135
He ransacked the place
after killing Sean.

10:48.167 --> 10:50.503
In the video we saw, he clearly
wasn't looking for anything.

10:50.536 --> 10:52.205
He just lost it.

10:52.238 --> 10:53.373
Did you see the way
that he kept squinting

10:53.406 --> 10:55.041
and shielding his eyes even though

10:55.074 --> 10:57.277
there was no light above him?

10:57.310 --> 10:58.512
Light sensitivity.

10:58.545 --> 11:00.012
Plus emotional outbursts.

11:00.046 --> 11:01.248
Pretty clear he's
going through some kind

11:01.281 --> 11:01.930
of psychotic break.

11:01.998 --> 11:03.367
That could make him easier to spot.

11:04.408 --> 11:06.610
We should ask eyewitnesses
about strangers

11:06.643 --> 11:10.481
exhibiting any innocuous,
repetitive behaviors.

11:10.515 --> 11:12.284
There were no defensive wounds,

11:12.316 --> 11:14.219
no signs of torture or ligature marks,

11:14.252 --> 11:15.891
so it's unlikely he was held.

11:16.202 --> 11:17.871
Did you run a tox screen?

11:17.904 --> 11:19.854
Came up clean just as in
the previous two murders.

11:19.854 --> 11:21.456
Alvez: Well, if our
unsub didn't drug Sean

11:21.489 --> 11:23.224
and he didn't fight
back, then he must have

11:23.257 --> 11:25.161
incapacitated him somehow.

11:25.194 --> 11:27.163
Yeah. Perhaps with a sharp
bump to the back of the head.

11:27.195 --> 11:29.197
Was the C.O.D. decapitation?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.732
I believe so.

11:33.334 --> 11:36.204
He most likely used some
kind of a heavy blade,

11:36.238 --> 11:37.839
a broad or a felling ax.

11:37.873 --> 11:39.141
That was my thinking, as well,

11:39.174 --> 11:41.209
and it was done perimortem.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.978
Sean was alive when this happened?

11:43.011 --> 11:44.780
Yeah, and this killer
knew what he was doing.

11:44.813 --> 11:46.248
A couple of clean
strikes, and... kktt...

11:46.281 --> 11:48.050
He was finished.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.086
That feels quick, almost transactional.

11:50.118 --> 11:52.153
Yeah. He didn't want to
prolong the experience.

11:52.186 --> 11:54.355
He was focused. He wanted
to get it done with.

11:54.388 --> 11:56.224
And check out this latent bruising.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.393
At first, I wasn't sure if
it happened during the attack

11:58.426 --> 12:01.796
or when he fell, but it appears
to be some kind of marking.

12:01.829 --> 12:04.867
The unsub must have
pressed it into his chest.

12:04.900 --> 12:08.137
Dr. Martinez, did you find anything
similar on the other victims?

12:08.170 --> 12:10.406
There was some latent
bruising in the same vicinity,

12:10.439 --> 12:12.842
but I'm not sure about
symbols or markings.

12:12.874 --> 12:14.042
Are the bodies still here?

12:14.075 --> 12:15.176
Yes, they are.

12:15.209 --> 12:17.079
- Well, let's take a look.
- Ok.

12:23.985 --> 12:26.221
Mendoza: Ms. Clarke,
thank you for coming in.

12:26.254 --> 12:29.090
Have a seat.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.826
I understand you
worked with Sean Mcafee.

12:31.859 --> 12:34.129
Yes, that's right. We're working...

12:34.162 --> 12:36.132
We worked on the same project together,

12:36.165 --> 12:37.900
this high rise going up downtown.

12:37.932 --> 12:40.034
And he called you yesterday afternoon?

12:40.068 --> 12:41.971
Yes. He was running late.

12:42.003 --> 12:43.471
He just wanted to let
me know that I should

12:43.504 --> 12:45.373
start the meeting by myself.

12:45.406 --> 12:47.442
I was surprised, but he also has a lot

12:47.475 --> 12:50.044
of personal things going
on in his life, so...

12:50.078 --> 12:52.248
Oh, yeah? Like what?

12:52.281 --> 12:54.483
He has a sister that just
went to jail for 10 years...

12:54.516 --> 12:56.017
Drugs or something.

12:56.050 --> 12:59.220
Sean was filing for custody
of her daughter Kara.

12:59.253 --> 13:00.822
He wanted to raise her.

13:00.855 --> 13:02.457
That's why he was late

13:02.491 --> 13:06.061
because he was having lunch with
his niece and the case worker.

13:06.094 --> 13:07.128
It was their first sit-down.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.864
Sean was gonna be a father.

13:12.935 --> 13:14.837
We got to bring that case worker in.

13:14.869 --> 13:17.238
Yes, and like our other two victims,

13:17.272 --> 13:20.810
Sean was last seen
with or around a child.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.012
They're fathers or father figures.

13:23.045 --> 13:24.512
That's why the unsub is targeting them.

13:24.546 --> 13:26.080
Yeah.

13:26.113 --> 13:27.282
Man: Watch your head!

13:27.315 --> 13:29.384
[Indistinct chatter]

13:32.220 --> 13:36.357
Hey, hey. I got it. I got it. Thank you.

13:36.391 --> 13:37.993
Hey. Come on, bud. Let's go.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.496
Even Lionel Messi has to practice.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.264
Coming!

13:49.137 --> 13:52.208
Lewis: So it turns out that
there was latent bruising

13:52.241 --> 13:55.411
on the torsos and
chests of all 3 victims.

13:55.444 --> 13:58.247
A closer analysis of
the contusions revealed

13:58.280 --> 14:01.050
that they're some kind of characters.

14:01.083 --> 14:04.252
Now taken together, we think
they may be mathematical symbols,

14:04.286 --> 14:06.255
perhaps part of a larger expression.

14:06.287 --> 14:10.091
Schrodinger's equation. They form
the basis of Schrodinger's equation.

14:12.261 --> 14:15.296
Prentiss: Well, I've
heard of Schrodinger's cat.

14:15.329 --> 14:17.398
Both describe potential energy.

14:17.431 --> 14:20.469
Schrodinger's equation is the
basis of quantum mechanics.

14:20.502 --> 14:22.070
It describes the probability that

14:22.103 --> 14:23.605
a particle will behave in a certain way

14:23.638 --> 14:25.608
in a certain place in a certain time.

14:25.641 --> 14:28.110
The implications of this gave
rise to the many worlds theory

14:28.142 --> 14:29.043
of the universe.

14:29.078 --> 14:31.247
Mendoza: Which is that
reality as we know it

14:31.280 --> 14:33.949
is only one of many possible universes.

14:33.982 --> 14:36.618
Yeah. Yeah. I'm with you.

14:36.651 --> 14:38.219
I watch "Doctor Who."

14:38.252 --> 14:40.189
Jareau: Ok. So does our unsub think he's

14:40.222 --> 14:42.024
in a parallel universe?

14:42.056 --> 14:43.491
Alvez: What does killing dads have to do

14:43.525 --> 14:45.261
with parallel universes?

14:45.294 --> 14:47.263
I mean, maybe he's mad at his own?

14:47.296 --> 14:49.364
Even if he is, why take their heads?

14:49.397 --> 14:50.632
It doesn't line up.

14:50.666 --> 14:52.534
You know, we said these
kills are transactional.

14:52.566 --> 14:56.004
Maybe the heads are sacrifices
or tokens of some sort,

14:56.037 --> 14:58.106
something the unsub needs to do

14:58.140 --> 15:01.911
in order to pass between realities.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.512
I mean, it only has
to make sense to him.

15:03.545 --> 15:05.414
Yeah. Matt's right.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.649
Most serial killers engage in some kind

15:07.682 --> 15:09.217
of fantastical thinking, right...

15:09.251 --> 15:11.120
Bundy, Dahmer.

15:11.152 --> 15:13.122
Son of Sam thought he saw a talking dog,

15:13.155 --> 15:15.156
but this particular delusion that

15:15.190 --> 15:17.126
this unsub is experiencing,

15:17.158 --> 15:18.960
it comes from somewhere.

15:18.993 --> 15:21.029
Not to mention, outside
of our boy genius,

15:21.063 --> 15:23.232
most people don't know that equation.

15:23.265 --> 15:25.401
Yeah. We should be looking
for people with a background

15:25.434 --> 15:27.603
in theoretical physics
and quantum mechanics.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.673
And fast because based on
the markings on those bodies,

15:30.705 --> 15:33.007
his equation isn't complete.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.044
He hasn't finished his proof yet.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.448
Yes, honey. I got the onion pakora

15:39.480 --> 15:42.717
and the mango chutney, too, extra hot.

15:42.751 --> 15:45.353
Ok. All right. Then she
can have my butter chicken.

15:45.387 --> 15:48.257
All right. See you soon. Love you.

15:53.261 --> 15:54.930
Unh!

15:57.099 --> 16:00.335
[Thud]

16:00.368 --> 16:01.970
[Splat]

16:02.003 --> 16:03.605
Creature: Ha ha ha!

16:08.209 --> 16:12.315
You have to mark him, Kyle.

16:17.507 --> 16:20.310
Thanks. Victim's name
was Dan Montgomery.

16:20.342 --> 16:22.244
He was picking up food
for his wife and son.

16:22.278 --> 16:23.846
Did he have the same
kind of latent bruising

16:23.879 --> 16:25.314
on his chest as the others?

16:25.347 --> 16:27.117
Yeah. The next symbols in the equation.

16:27.338 --> 16:29.774
Ok. Thanks.

16:29.806 --> 16:31.374
Man: Look. I'm not saying it
was a walk of shame or anything,

16:31.407 --> 16:35.146
but, uh, these are yesterday's clothes.

16:35.179 --> 16:36.380
Oh. Sounds like a hell of a night.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.246
This is Kevin Patterson.

16:37.281 --> 16:39.117
He was in the bar next door last night.

16:39.150 --> 16:40.818
- What'd you see?
- I had a few drinks,

16:40.850 --> 16:42.319
uh, met a woman.

16:42.353 --> 16:43.420
We got to chatting.

16:43.454 --> 16:45.189
Things were going well.

16:45.222 --> 16:46.891
I was pretty sure she liked me.

16:46.924 --> 16:49.127
Anyway, I stepped outside
while she was in the restroom.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.395
Then I saw this guy across the way.

16:51.428 --> 16:55.366
He, uh, had something in his
hand, I think, a large stick,

16:55.398 --> 16:58.401
but I heard him say, "isn't this enough?"

16:58.435 --> 17:00.370
Why isn't this enough?"

17:00.404 --> 17:02.140
Who was he talking to?

17:02.173 --> 17:05.541
Nobody. I just figured he
was some homeless drunk,

17:05.576 --> 17:08.246
but then he turned
to me stone-cold sober

17:08.279 --> 17:12.016
and said, "I need to get back."

17:12.049 --> 17:15.353
Freaked me out, and the girl
I met came out of the bar.

17:15.386 --> 17:16.954
We left together.

17:16.986 --> 17:18.488
Uh, I never saw a body or anything.

17:18.521 --> 17:19.857
I didn't think about it
again till this morning

17:19.888 --> 17:21.458
when I saw the news.

17:21.492 --> 17:23.226
All right. We're gonna need the
name of the woman you left with.

17:23.260 --> 17:25.127
And, Kevin, I'd like you to work
with one of our sketch artists.

17:25.162 --> 17:26.430
Is that all right?

17:26.463 --> 17:27.565
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

17:27.598 --> 17:30.142
- Great.
- Right this way.

17:31.601 --> 17:34.338
Our unsub's psychosis is getting worse.

17:34.370 --> 17:35.505
He's hallucinating now.

17:35.539 --> 17:37.141
Yeah. He's not even concerned
about a potential witness

17:37.174 --> 17:39.076
seeing him either.

17:39.108 --> 17:40.877
Well, what was the last
thing Kevin heard him say?

17:40.910 --> 17:43.280
He needs to get back.

17:43.386 --> 17:45.388
So let's put this all together.

17:45.421 --> 17:49.360
Parallel universes, wrong timeline,

17:49.392 --> 17:52.595
get back as in cross over.

17:52.629 --> 17:54.365
I think I know how
this is all connected.

17:54.398 --> 17:56.400
We need to deliver the profile.

17:58.501 --> 18:01.905
We're looking for a male in
his late 30s or early 40s,

18:01.939 --> 18:04.240
who we believe is killing in order

18:04.274 --> 18:06.510
to cross over into a parallel universe.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.979
Simmons: This unsub is a
man living inside a delusion,

18:09.011 --> 18:11.447
a fractured reality that
he believes is wrong.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.383
Rossi: The idea that we're
living in the wrong timeline

18:13.417 --> 18:17.388
is most commonly described
as the Mandela effect.

18:17.421 --> 18:20.490
Lewis: The Mandela effect is a
psychological phenomenon similar

18:20.524 --> 18:22.960
to false memory syndrome.

18:22.992 --> 18:25.162
It's so called because a
significant number of people have

18:25.194 --> 18:27.063
a very clear memory of Nelson Mandela

18:27.096 --> 18:28.998
dying in prison in the 1980s

18:29.031 --> 18:30.934
when we know that not to be true.

18:30.968 --> 18:32.469
He did, in fact, survive, was released,

18:32.501 --> 18:33.703
and made president of South Africa

18:33.737 --> 18:35.572
until he passed away in 2013.

18:35.604 --> 18:38.075
Scientists and psychologists
haven't figured out

18:38.107 --> 18:39.275
this phenomenon yet.

18:39.308 --> 18:40.344
Reid: But a popular theory on line is

18:40.376 --> 18:43.346
that we are currently
living in a parallel reality,

18:43.380 --> 18:45.015
that at some point in the recent past

18:45.047 --> 18:46.650
our world or timeline shifted,

18:46.682 --> 18:48.551
and the evidence is all around us.

18:48.585 --> 18:53.056
Things we collectively remember
to be one way are actually another.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.093
Names of childhood books, authors,

18:56.125 --> 18:58.194
certain phrases, even brands.

18:58.228 --> 19:02.298
"The Berenstein Bears" while others
recall "the Berenstain Bears."

19:02.332 --> 19:04.101
Unh!

19:04.133 --> 19:06.202
Unh! Unh!

19:06.236 --> 19:09.306
Reid: Or Curious George... do you
guys remember a tail or no tail?

19:09.338 --> 19:10.573
A tail.

19:10.606 --> 19:12.108
Got to have a tail, right?

19:12.142 --> 19:13.544
He's a monkey.

19:13.576 --> 19:15.378
No tail.

19:15.412 --> 19:16.613
Simmons: We don't know
what sparked our unsub's

19:16.645 --> 19:18.147
interest in the Mandela effect,

19:18.181 --> 19:19.216
but when we find that, we find him.

19:19.248 --> 19:21.317
Mendoza: Do we have a
theory on why he's targeting

19:21.351 --> 19:23.354
fathers or father figures?

19:23.386 --> 19:25.321
Well, as of right now,
given the violence,

19:25.354 --> 19:29.360
he seems driven by a hatred
perhaps towards his own father.

19:29.392 --> 19:30.995
Alvez: This man is dangerous.

19:31.027 --> 19:33.497
He's isolated, and
he's mission-oriented.

19:33.529 --> 19:36.399
[Grunting]

19:36.432 --> 19:39.068
Alvez: We have to issue a warning
to the public not to confront him.

19:39.102 --> 19:40.771
[Screaming]

19:40.804 --> 19:42.773
He's out there. Let's get to work.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.156
Thank you.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.378
Aah!

19:47.411 --> 19:49.747
[Breathing heavily]

19:53.816 --> 19:56.120
Why won't you let me see him?

19:56.152 --> 20:00.790
You can't see what you
refuse to look at, Kyle.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.493
You're running out of time.

20:12.268 --> 20:13.336
Coffee?

20:13.370 --> 20:15.406
Lewis: Yes. Thank you.

20:15.439 --> 20:17.408
Look, guys. We are banging our heads

20:17.440 --> 20:18.642
against a wall here.

20:18.674 --> 20:20.243
I mean, Denver is
littered with colleges,

20:20.277 --> 20:21.444
and we've already worked our way

20:21.478 --> 20:23.147
through most of the
academics and scientists.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.414
Well, you know what? We
just need to step back

20:24.448 --> 20:26.315
and look at things differently.

20:26.348 --> 20:30.520
The Mandela effect is a unique
psychological construct, right?

20:30.554 --> 20:32.523
I mean, there's got to be a good reason

20:32.556 --> 20:34.658
why he latched onto it in particular.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.626
Well, creation of dissociative realities

20:36.660 --> 20:41.131
can often be a crutch for people
who've suffered extreme trauma.

20:41.163 --> 20:42.833
Ok. Let's run with that.

20:42.865 --> 20:45.669
We're looking for a loss
triggered by an event

20:45.701 --> 20:48.671
likely caused by the unsub himself,

20:48.704 --> 20:51.474
and then this inability
to accept this reality

20:51.508 --> 20:54.478
would be a defense mechanism
for a mind racked with guilt.

20:54.510 --> 20:58.147
Alvez: So unable to face reality,
our unsub has created his own.

20:58.181 --> 21:01.085
Still doesn't explain why he's
killing father figures, though.

21:01.117 --> 21:03.519
Unless it does. Say his own guilt

21:03.553 --> 21:05.556
is a major factor in a break like this.

21:05.588 --> 21:07.723
That would mean that
he's picking out dads

21:07.757 --> 21:09.460
out of some kind of self-loathing.

21:09.492 --> 21:14.464
This isn't about his
hatred toward his own dad.

21:14.498 --> 21:16.100
These men are surrogates for him.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.367
He's angry at himself.

21:18.401 --> 21:20.104
Our unsub's the father here.

21:33.182 --> 21:35.618
Hey.

21:35.652 --> 21:37.354
What happened to you last night?

21:37.386 --> 21:38.521
I thought you'd come by.

21:38.555 --> 21:39.623
I texted you.

21:39.655 --> 21:42.459
Um...

21:42.491 --> 21:44.494
Oh. Here. Come with me.

21:54.537 --> 21:56.440
Talk to me.

21:56.472 --> 21:58.274
I don't know what to say.

21:58.307 --> 22:00.344
Well, maybe you start
with why you canceled

22:00.376 --> 22:02.412
your trip a couple weeks ago.

22:02.444 --> 22:03.713
Like I said, there was an abduction.

22:03.747 --> 22:06.583
Emily, there's always gonna be a case,

22:06.615 --> 22:08.518
and you know I know, ok,

22:08.552 --> 22:10.320
but you were supposed
to come for the weekend,

22:10.353 --> 22:11.688
finally meet Keely.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.721
Mm-hmm.

22:12.756 --> 22:15.842
And now you're back to
dodging my calls and texts.

22:15.842 --> 22:17.177
Did I do something wrong?

22:17.211 --> 22:20.748
No, and thank you for the flowers.

22:20.780 --> 22:25.352
Oh, you're welcome, but
if not, then what is it?

22:25.386 --> 22:31.992
This has just been harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

22:32.025 --> 22:35.996
You know, I never wanted moving
here to change anything between us.

22:36.030 --> 22:41.069
What I want... Is you.

22:41.101 --> 22:43.136
I want us,

22:43.169 --> 22:44.371
but right now, it feels like

22:44.405 --> 22:47.175
you're... Pulling away.

22:47.207 --> 22:49.076
Ohh.

22:49.109 --> 22:52.280
Are we breaking up?

22:52.312 --> 22:55.649
No. That's not what I want.

22:55.683 --> 22:57.218
Well, then what do you want? Tell me.

22:57.251 --> 22:58.954
I'll do it.

23:13.067 --> 23:15.136
We're at work.

23:18.973 --> 23:21.842
Before you go back to D.C.,

23:21.876 --> 23:23.944
I just want to know where we stand, ok?

23:31.985 --> 23:33.088
[Sighs]

23:35.356 --> 23:36.891
Oh, hey. I was just looking for you.

23:36.924 --> 23:37.992
What's up?

23:38.024 --> 23:39.660
Penelope found something hinky

23:39.694 --> 23:40.927
in regards to the social worker

23:40.961 --> 23:42.396
who was helping Sean Mcafee.

23:42.430 --> 23:43.898
She's bringing the
others up to speed now.

23:43.931 --> 23:46.201
Ok. Great.

23:51.065 --> 23:52.633
Go ahead, Garcia.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.028
Ok. So our initial interview
with Sean's case worker

23:54.060 --> 23:56.163
Brenda Hacker didn't
raise any red flags,

23:56.195 --> 23:58.064
but she was the last
person to see him alive,

23:58.097 --> 24:00.134
so I did some additional spelunking.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.234
And?

24:01.268 --> 24:02.068
Welcome to the thunderdome.

24:02.102 --> 24:02.870
I looked at Brenda's financial records,

24:02.903 --> 24:06.274
her phone records, her case records.

24:06.307 --> 24:09.343
She specializes in a
very specific clientele,

24:09.375 --> 24:11.945
single dads who are fighting for custody

24:11.979 --> 24:13.314
of their child or children,

24:13.347 --> 24:17.318
and she has an unusually
high success/placement rate.

24:17.350 --> 24:18.285
How unusual?

24:18.318 --> 24:20.221
Like, get yourself to
Vegas, call your bookie,

24:20.253 --> 24:21.355
the fix is in unusual.

24:21.387 --> 24:22.689
You think she's greasing the wheels?

24:22.722 --> 24:25.393
Oh, she's lubing them up big time.

24:25.425 --> 24:26.660
Uh, stop smiling, Luke Alvez.

24:26.693 --> 24:28.462
I can feel it. That
joke was not for you.

24:28.494 --> 24:30.397
What I'm saying is her testimony holds

24:30.431 --> 24:31.598
a special kind of weight with the judge.

24:31.632 --> 24:33.500
She's got her finger in the
cookie jar somehow or another.

24:33.533 --> 24:35.201
We should bring her back in.

24:35.234 --> 24:37.038
Doesn't seem like a coincidence
that she works with fathers

24:37.070 --> 24:38.338
and our unsub might be one.

24:38.372 --> 24:40.308
Lewis: Good work, Garcia.

24:40.340 --> 24:41.474
Alvez: Penelope.

24:41.508 --> 24:44.010
New phone. Who dis?

24:44.043 --> 24:46.179
Thank you.

24:46.212 --> 24:48.348
You should worship at
my throne, Luke Alvez.

24:48.382 --> 24:54.087
Oh, but I do. I do. You know I do.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.489
What does that even mean?

24:57.290 --> 24:58.392
Man: Another time.

24:59.423 --> 25:00.094
Come on, Dad.

25:00.126 --> 25:01.261
Mo would let me drive.

25:01.295 --> 25:02.663
I have my learner's permit.

25:02.695 --> 25:03.997
Boy: Yeah. Let her, Dad.

25:04.030 --> 25:04.965
Here. You can start the car,

25:04.999 --> 25:06.500
but that's it.

25:06.532 --> 25:08.501
Girl: Dad, that's so lame.

25:08.535 --> 25:10.137
Man: That's all you're
gonna get for now.

25:10.170 --> 25:12.307
I'll take you out later
when it's just the two of us.

25:14.008 --> 25:16.510
[Sighs]

25:16.542 --> 25:19.079
[Car starts]

25:19.113 --> 25:22.016
Kyle: Unh!

25:22.049 --> 25:23.183
Unh!

25:23.216 --> 25:24.417
Ohh!

25:24.451 --> 25:26.087
Dad?!

25:28.055 --> 25:29.156
Aah! Aah!

25:29.189 --> 25:31.659
Oh, no!

25:31.692 --> 25:34.095
Aah! Aah! Aah!

25:34.127 --> 25:36.463
Boy: Dad!
Kyle: Drive, drive!

25:36.497 --> 25:38.332
- Drive now!
- No, no!

25:38.365 --> 25:40.768
Go!

25:40.800 --> 25:44.004
- Girl: Aah!
- Drive!

25:44.038 --> 25:45.640
[Tires squealing]

25:54.520 --> 25:56.489
Wow. This place really
clears out at lunch.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.196
Yeah. This granola
bar will do it for me.

25:59.196 --> 26:02.300
Hmm. Me, too.

26:02.332 --> 26:04.302
So you're not having lunch with Andrew?

26:08.206 --> 26:10.408
3 months ago,

26:10.440 --> 26:13.477
Andrew asked me to
move to Denver with him,

26:13.511 --> 26:16.148
but I'm happy where I am.

26:16.180 --> 26:17.681
I'm not ready to leave the BAU.

26:17.715 --> 26:20.318
I haven't even met his daughter yet.

26:20.350 --> 26:22.786
Why? You've been seeing
him for over a year.

26:22.820 --> 26:25.523
Keely was already in Colorado,

26:25.556 --> 26:27.525
and the couple of times
she visited last year,

26:27.559 --> 26:29.394
the timing just didn't work out.

26:29.427 --> 26:31.730
Hey. You're putting up walls.

26:31.763 --> 26:34.398
I know because I've
put up plenty myself.

26:34.431 --> 26:36.467
Uprooting my whole life?

26:36.501 --> 26:38.737
Moving halfway across the country?

26:38.770 --> 26:41.273
That's just not something
that I ever had in my plans,

26:41.305 --> 26:42.673
and what if it doesn't work out?

26:42.706 --> 26:45.476
Take it from a guy who just
married his third ex-wife

26:45.510 --> 26:47.546
for the second time.

26:47.579 --> 26:51.483
All of this work is worth it.

26:51.515 --> 26:54.785
You deserve this. Be honest with him.

26:54.819 --> 26:57.789
Tell him how you feel.

26:57.821 --> 26:59.791
Simmons: Sorry to interrupt.
Denver PD just found

26:59.823 --> 27:01.359
another decapitated body.

27:01.391 --> 27:03.527
The head is missing, and
so are the man's two kids.

27:03.561 --> 27:05.563
JJ and Reid are en route.

27:05.597 --> 27:06.464
[Camera shutter clicks]

27:10.534 --> 27:12.403
The fact that he left his vehicle behind

27:12.436 --> 27:14.505
means he has no
intention of coming back.

27:14.539 --> 27:15.807
He's never really hidden from us,

27:15.840 --> 27:18.209
but this just feels
like the final straw.

27:18.243 --> 27:19.311
He's finished one way or another.

27:19.343 --> 27:21.645
Based on his equation, these
are his final 3 victims.

27:21.678 --> 27:23.348
Ok, but then why the change in M.O.?

27:23.380 --> 27:24.882
Why abduct two teenagers?

27:24.916 --> 27:27.586
Probably has something to do
with the loss that he suffered.

27:30.588 --> 27:32.456
Jareau: Oh.

27:32.490 --> 27:33.592
Look at this.

27:36.727 --> 27:40.398
Oh, Ethan. I've been
leaving you messages.

27:40.430 --> 27:41.665
I hope you're getting them.

27:41.698 --> 27:43.368
I've been trying to explain to you

27:43.400 --> 27:46.537
that there are an infinite
number of realities,

27:46.571 --> 27:49.773
branches, and 7 years ago,

27:49.806 --> 27:53.377
our universe, it
branched into another one.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.813
It... it was another timeline.

27:55.847 --> 27:59.384
It was the wrong one
because you aren't here,

27:59.417 --> 28:04.755
but I've figured out a way to
cross over to get back to you.

28:04.789 --> 28:06.523
I'm coming for you.

28:06.556 --> 28:08.392
It's all gonna be ok.

28:08.426 --> 28:10.794
Don't be scared.

28:10.828 --> 28:12.564
Dad is coming.

28:12.597 --> 28:14.299
So it was his son that he lost.

28:14.331 --> 28:16.333
He'll do anything to get
back to him, even kill,

28:16.367 --> 28:17.502
maybe even trade one kid's life

28:17.534 --> 28:19.336
for another.

28:19.369 --> 28:22.306
Son's name is Ethan, right?

28:22.340 --> 28:23.742
Ethan was the final piece of the puzzle.

28:23.774 --> 28:25.744
Our unsub's name is George Kyle Peters.

28:25.776 --> 28:27.578
He goes by Kyle. He's a former

28:27.611 --> 28:28.812
high school physics teacher,

28:28.846 --> 28:31.416
and his son Ethan died
when he was 7 years old

28:31.448 --> 28:33.350
in a horrific car crash.

28:33.384 --> 28:35.487
I'm sending you the info now.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.522
It says here that Kyle was driving

28:37.554 --> 28:39.724
his 7-year-old son
home from a movie

28:39.756 --> 28:42.726
when he struck a patch of
black ice and lost control.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.364
Ethan was... Decapitated.

28:52.503 --> 28:54.505
Rusty!

28:54.539 --> 28:58.076
Garcia: Two months ago was the
7-year anniversary of this death.

28:58.109 --> 28:59.644
The anniversary was his trigger.

28:59.677 --> 29:02.546
Kyle was in a coma for
months following the accident.

29:02.580 --> 29:05.550
When he woke up, his son was gone.

29:05.582 --> 29:06.717
Well, that's a hell of a stressor.

29:06.751 --> 29:09.954
Lewis: Kyle's mind would not
let him process this grief.

29:09.986 --> 29:12.556
[Screaming]

29:12.590 --> 29:14.926
No matter what kind of
support he might have gotten,

29:14.958 --> 29:16.860
he could not conceive of a world
that did not have his son in it,

29:16.894 --> 29:19.597
so he created a new one,

29:19.629 --> 29:21.800
one where Ethan was still alive.

29:21.832 --> 29:23.834
Where's Kyle been the last 7 years?

29:23.868 --> 29:25.470
In and out of institutions.

29:25.503 --> 29:26.604
He was released 4 months ago.

29:26.637 --> 29:28.706
[Kyle screaming]

29:28.740 --> 29:31.576
I did everything you asked!

29:31.609 --> 29:33.477
I brought you their heads as proof.

29:33.511 --> 29:35.946
7 lives for the 7
years that have passed.

29:35.979 --> 29:37.614
Alvez: The two teens that he kidnapped,

29:37.648 --> 29:40.752
Emma and Colin Choi, Colin's 14.

29:40.784 --> 29:43.854
That's the same age his son
would have been if he survived.

29:43.888 --> 29:46.424
Mendoza: Looks like we caught a break.

29:46.456 --> 29:48.359
Garcia wanted us to pull hard copies

29:48.392 --> 29:49.693
of all of Brenda Hacker's files,

29:49.726 --> 29:51.495
the ones that hadn't been digitized.

29:51.529 --> 29:53.565
Turns out 12 years
ago Brenda was assigned

29:53.598 --> 29:55.066
to help Kyle Peters get custody

29:55.099 --> 29:56.734
of his son Ethan.

29:56.767 --> 29:59.069
Wait a minute. The same
person was the case worker

29:59.102 --> 30:01.538
for our third victim Sean and our unsub?

30:01.571 --> 30:02.974
We thinking that's just as coincidence?

30:03.006 --> 30:04.708
Well, actually, it might be.

30:04.742 --> 30:06.677
Social workers here, they're
forced to see a lot of clients,

30:06.711 --> 30:08.146
cover a lot of ground,

30:08.178 --> 30:09.781
and we haven't seen any connection

30:09.813 --> 30:11.582
between her and our other victims, so...

30:11.616 --> 30:12.984
Hold on. It says here Kyle was arrested

30:13.016 --> 30:15.719
on two DUI charges in college.

30:15.753 --> 30:17.755
He sought help for a drinking problem.

30:17.789 --> 30:20.592
And yet Brenda still
managed to get him custody.

30:20.625 --> 30:21.792
Like I said, call your bookies.

30:21.825 --> 30:24.595
That would indicate a classic
narcissistic savior complex.

30:24.629 --> 30:26.697
Brenda likes that these men need her,

30:26.731 --> 30:28.133
and she uses it against them.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.568
Penelope, I need everything
you've found on her so far.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.003
Got it. Coming, coming.

30:32.035 --> 30:33.571
Is Brenda here?

30:33.603 --> 30:35.038
Just arrived. Put her in my office.

30:35.071 --> 30:38.142
Ok. We need to check out
Kyle's home and last knowns.

30:38.176 --> 30:40.677
Talk to his former
co-workers and neighbors.

30:40.711 --> 30:42.580
He's taken these kids someplace,

30:42.612 --> 30:44.448
likely somewhere personal.

30:50.921 --> 30:53.891
I did everything you asked!

30:53.925 --> 30:56.528
Now it's time to make the trade!

30:56.561 --> 30:58.196
Who's he talking to?

30:58.228 --> 31:01.565
Colin: He's crazy. There's no one there.

31:01.599 --> 31:02.966
We've got to get out of here.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.502
How?

31:04.534 --> 31:05.702
Help me with my tape.

31:05.735 --> 31:07.171
Kyle: That's not what we agreed to!

31:07.205 --> 31:10.574
You told me that this
would be over with!

31:10.608 --> 31:12.877
Wait a minute. She was
making money off these guys?

31:12.909 --> 31:14.579
Yep. Extortion plain as day.

31:14.611 --> 31:17.014
What? All these calls,
all this time together.

31:17.048 --> 31:19.017
Maybe it didn't stop there.

31:19.050 --> 31:21.552
Well, Brenda's smart. She's
not gonna incriminate herself.

31:21.586 --> 31:22.821
Well, we can't give her an out.

31:22.853 --> 31:24.621
Brenda knows our unsub and well.

31:24.655 --> 31:26.625
Right now, she's our best
bet at finding those kids.

31:28.059 --> 31:30.662
Brenda, when was the last
time you saw Kyle Peters?

31:30.695 --> 31:33.130
10, 12 years ago.

31:33.164 --> 31:35.500
But you were aware that
his son passed away?

31:35.533 --> 31:37.534
Yeah. I heard. I didn't
know him very well.

31:37.568 --> 31:39.737
I was just his case worker.

31:39.770 --> 31:41.239
According to cell phone
records, you called Kyle

31:41.272 --> 31:44.008
7 years ago.

31:44.041 --> 31:45.577
I don't really remember.

31:45.609 --> 31:47.978
And prior to that when
you were handling his case,

31:48.012 --> 31:50.648
you called him 4 or 5 times a day

31:50.680 --> 31:52.583
from your personal phone,

31:52.617 --> 31:53.851
sometimes after hours.

31:53.885 --> 31:55.186
That sound like work to you?

31:55.218 --> 31:56.386
Uh, it does not.

31:56.419 --> 31:58.889
I think you knew Kyle a lot
better than you're letting on.

31:58.923 --> 32:01.993
Perhaps you saw each other socially.

32:02.025 --> 32:04.094
I'm not comfortable
with this conversation.

32:04.128 --> 32:08.198
Brenda, these are
financial records, yours.

32:08.232 --> 32:11.035
Uh, you'll see that there are
a large number of cash deposits

32:11.068 --> 32:12.737
during the time period in question,

32:12.770 --> 32:15.039
and what's interesting
is that they match up

32:15.071 --> 32:18.008
with these records here,
which are Kyle's bank records.

32:18.042 --> 32:20.879
They show withdrawals
from the same time period.

32:20.911 --> 32:22.913
I don't like what you're implying.

32:22.946 --> 32:25.850
Prentiss: Ms. Hacker,
Kyle has killed 5 people.

32:25.882 --> 32:27.584
He's abducted two teenagers,

32:27.618 --> 32:29.620
most likely with the
intent to kill them, too.

32:29.654 --> 32:31.623
I don't know anything about that.

32:31.656 --> 32:34.058
I haven't done anything wrong.

32:34.090 --> 32:36.994
Well, now that's not
entirely true, Brenda, is it?

32:37.027 --> 32:39.196
You target single men, like Sean,

32:39.229 --> 32:42.833
fathers who are desperate to
retain custody of their children.

32:42.867 --> 32:45.003
You get them to slip you a
little cash under the table,

32:45.035 --> 32:47.804
and in exchange, you doctor their files.

32:47.838 --> 32:48.743
You can't prove that.

32:49.829 --> 32:50.526
Not yet.

32:50.526 --> 32:54.056
You convinced a judge that Kyle
should get custody of his son

32:54.056 --> 32:56.976
despite his history with alcohol abuse.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.845
My guess is he was drunk on
the night of the accident,

32:59.879 --> 33:01.942
and when he woke up from his coma,

33:01.942 --> 33:03.949
you called him, and you
helped him fix his story.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.052
You added in that bit
about the black ice.

33:06.084 --> 33:09.945
Now it's pretty clear that story
was to protect you, not him.

33:09.945 --> 33:12.131
You didn't want anybody
digging into Kyle's past

33:12.179 --> 33:15.450
and finding something that
you worked so hard to hide.

33:15.857 --> 33:18.926
The way I see it, that's
child endangerment.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.528
So, Brenda, do yourself a favor.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.563
Sit back down and tell us

33:22.597 --> 33:24.331
about your relationship with Kyle,

33:24.365 --> 33:26.867
and we'll take your
cooperation into consideration.

33:33.308 --> 33:34.475
What do you want to know?

33:34.509 --> 33:36.778
Everything that wasn't in his case file.

33:36.810 --> 33:38.445
[Grunting]

33:38.479 --> 33:41.049
Kyle: Now we agreed, Rusty.

33:41.081 --> 33:42.950
It had to be.

33:42.983 --> 33:44.985
That's what you said!

33:45.019 --> 33:47.422
Aah!

33:47.454 --> 33:49.491
[Groaning]

33:54.428 --> 33:56.464
[Whimpering]

33:58.499 --> 33:59.968
Ugh.

34:12.016 --> 34:13.920
Prentiss: Brenda told
us that Kyle and his son

34:13.920 --> 34:16.197
loved to explore an area
around an abandoned gold mine

34:16.197 --> 34:17.020
in the foothills.

34:17.020 --> 34:18.621
Yeah. They went every weekend.

34:18.654 --> 34:20.156
Simmons: That makes sense.
Kyle was a scientist.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.859
He wanted to foster a
similar love in his son.

34:22.891 --> 34:24.616
Alvez: We're sure this is where
he would take Emma and Colin?

34:24.616 --> 34:26.386
It's ideal. The mine's secluded.

34:26.386 --> 34:27.710
It's been vacant for decades.

34:27.952 --> 34:30.821
We need to be careful.
We're gonna be on his turf.

34:35.757 --> 34:37.561
Rusty: This is it, Kyle.

34:37.594 --> 34:40.764
This child for yours.

34:40.797 --> 34:43.667
Please don't hurt me.

34:43.699 --> 34:46.369
[Crying]

34:46.402 --> 34:48.871
I just... I... I can't.

34:48.906 --> 34:50.875
I'm sorry. I can't.

34:50.908 --> 34:53.377
Don't you want to see your son again?

34:53.409 --> 34:54.978
Ohh, ohh.

34:55.011 --> 34:56.813
Please.

34:56.846 --> 34:58.716
This child for yours.

34:58.749 --> 35:00.250
Please.

35:05.288 --> 35:08.426
I'm sorry.

35:08.459 --> 35:10.194
I'm so sorry, Ethan.

35:12.930 --> 35:16.801
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:16.834 --> 35:19.470
I'm sorry.

35:19.502 --> 35:20.971
I'm so sorry, Ethan.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.923
Ohh! I'm so sorry!

35:41.758 --> 35:43.927
I'm so sorry, Ethan.

35:46.062 --> 35:48.265
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:49.832 --> 35:51.901
Simmons: These tracks lead inside.

35:51.935 --> 35:53.504
Lewis: This has got to be it.

35:53.537 --> 35:54.904
Alvez: According to the
map, there's another entrance

35:54.937 --> 35:55.972
at the north.

35:56.006 --> 35:57.575
Rossi: We should split up.

35:57.607 --> 36:00.528
Lewis, Alvez, Simmons, see
if there's another way in.

36:01.645 --> 36:03.881
Kyle: I'm sorry.

36:03.913 --> 36:06.549
Rossi: Kyle Peters, FBI!

36:06.582 --> 36:09.519
Drop the ax! Put it down!

36:09.553 --> 36:10.955
Prentiss: Kyle, look at me.

36:12.990 --> 36:14.792
You don't understand!

36:14.825 --> 36:16.961
He is on the other side, he
is trapped on the other side.

36:16.993 --> 36:18.828
He needs me! I am his father!

36:18.861 --> 36:21.331
I do understand.

36:21.365 --> 36:23.334
I know what it's like to have

36:23.366 --> 36:26.470
someone you love stuck in another world,

36:26.502 --> 36:28.738
wanting one thing, having another,

36:28.772 --> 36:30.908
but really having neither,

36:30.941 --> 36:32.843
afraid to face the truth.

36:32.875 --> 36:36.580
You have to face it, Kyle.

36:36.613 --> 36:38.683
Rusty: Kyle.

36:38.716 --> 36:41.786
No. He said this the
only way to get him back.

36:41.819 --> 36:43.587
He said a boy for a boy.

36:43.620 --> 36:46.424
Prentiss: It's not. Everything is wrong.

36:46.457 --> 36:47.625
No.

36:47.658 --> 36:49.093
That's what you think, right?

36:49.125 --> 36:50.593
Err!

36:50.627 --> 36:51.762
That these sacrifices you've been making

36:51.794 --> 36:53.330
will help you get your son back,

36:53.363 --> 36:55.365
but they won't.

36:55.399 --> 36:57.368
- It's not real.
- Err!

36:57.401 --> 36:58.836
Look again.

37:02.004 --> 37:04.008
Kyle, you have to face the truth.

37:14.517 --> 37:16.920
[Kyle sobbing]

37:28.399 --> 37:29.801
Oh, no.

37:36.006 --> 37:38.509
What is the truth?

37:38.542 --> 37:39.777
He's gone.

37:39.810 --> 37:41.112
Ohh!

37:41.145 --> 37:42.847
Ethan is gone.

37:44.415 --> 37:46.150
[Squeals]

37:46.183 --> 37:49.453
I just wanted to see him again.

37:49.486 --> 37:51.756
[Sobbing]

37:51.788 --> 37:53.924
[Ax clatters]

37:53.957 --> 37:55.792
We need medics asap.

37:58.828 --> 38:00.564
Come on.

38:00.596 --> 38:04.067
Oh, god. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

38:04.100 --> 38:06.703
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:26.122 --> 38:27.157
Mom! Mom!

38:27.191 --> 38:28.959
Mom!

38:33.964 --> 38:37.201
Jareau: All this talk
of alternate realities.

38:37.234 --> 38:41.005
Who do you think you'd
be in a parallel universe,

38:41.037 --> 38:43.473
you know, in one of
your imagined futures?

38:43.506 --> 38:44.674
Reid: I don't know.

38:44.707 --> 38:45.843
Come on.

38:45.875 --> 38:48.511
If you weren't an FBI agent,

38:48.544 --> 38:51.182
what would you do?

38:51.214 --> 38:52.983
You promise not to laugh?

38:57.955 --> 39:00.790
A cowboy.

39:00.823 --> 39:02.892
- A cowboy?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

39:02.926 --> 39:05.796
I'd, um, you know, have some horses,

39:05.828 --> 39:07.131
a few cattle,

39:07.163 --> 39:10.734
be surrounded by nature.

39:10.767 --> 39:13.037
And what would you do with cattle?

39:13.069 --> 39:16.173
Well, you know, look at them, pet them.

39:16.205 --> 39:18.209
I... I hadn't really thought about that,

39:18.241 --> 39:20.845
but I'll... I'll figure it out.

39:20.877 --> 39:24.948
Wow. I was... was not expecting that.

39:24.982 --> 39:27.852
Ahem. And, uh, you're there

39:27.884 --> 39:29.220
with Will and the boys.

39:29.252 --> 39:33.122
You run the flower
shop on Hickory Street.

39:33.156 --> 39:35.259
It's this cute, little
street in a tiny town

39:35.292 --> 39:37.060
in the middle of nowhere,

39:37.093 --> 39:38.796
and Rossi's there.

39:38.828 --> 39:41.499
He runs a saloon, which he lives above,

39:41.531 --> 39:45.970
and Garcia has a sanctuary
for wounded animals.

39:46.002 --> 39:48.771
Rossi: May I interest
anyone in a beverage?

39:48.805 --> 39:51.908
Wow. That's timing.

39:51.941 --> 39:55.778
So, uh, Dave, in another life,

39:55.812 --> 39:57.781
what would you be?

39:57.814 --> 40:00.116
Oh, that's easy. A boxer.

40:00.149 --> 40:01.651
Jareau: Hmm.

40:01.685 --> 40:03.888
In fact, there was a
time I was having dinner

40:03.921 --> 40:06.290
with Muhammad Ali, and we
were having a discussion

40:06.323 --> 40:08.792
just on this subject...

40:08.825 --> 40:12.897
Roads taken or not taken in this life.

40:12.930 --> 40:15.633
And what did he say?

40:15.665 --> 40:21.004
I don't quite remember because
I was drinking for the two of us,

40:21.037 --> 40:23.139
and it was the best scotch I'd ever had,

40:23.173 --> 40:26.142
and that's saying... A lot.

40:26.176 --> 40:29.580
So to paths not taken.

40:31.814 --> 40:33.149
To paths not taken.

40:37.955 --> 40:39.290
[Doorbell rings]

40:39.323 --> 40:40.723
Mendoza: Get the stove, all right?

40:40.756 --> 40:43.259
You know daddy likes to burn stuff.

40:43.292 --> 40:45.095
Hi.

40:45.127 --> 40:47.698
I thought you left.

40:47.730 --> 40:48.832
The team did,

40:48.865 --> 40:51.834
but, uh, I wasn't ready to go.

40:51.868 --> 40:54.805
In fact, I was hoping we
could have dinner tonight.

40:54.837 --> 40:57.975
Uh, well, my daughter and
I are just about to eat.

40:58.008 --> 41:01.812
Oh, of course. I... I'm sorry.

41:01.845 --> 41:05.214
I didn't mean to intrude.

41:05.247 --> 41:06.883
Hey.

41:09.218 --> 41:11.321
I'd love it if you'd join us.

41:11.354 --> 41:14.291
Heh. I would love to.

41:17.127 --> 41:18.962
Thank you.

41:29.839 --> 41:31.274
[Mendoza sighs]

41:31.308 --> 41:34.912
Keely, this is Emily.

41:34.944 --> 41:38.615
Emily, this is Keely.

41:38.649 --> 41:41.919
Hi. I have heard so much about you.

41:41.952 --> 41:44.354
And I've heard so much about you.

41:44.388 --> 41:46.957
You did not oversell it, Dad.

41:46.990 --> 41:50.794
- Keely.
- Dad.

41:50.827 --> 41:53.796
Oh! Ha ha ha!

41:53.830 --> 41:57.134
Uh, I would actually really like to hear

41:57.167 --> 41:59.036
more about that.

41:59.069 --> 42:02.873
What exactly did your dad not oversell?

42:02.906 --> 42:04.842
Maybe we should compare notes.

42:04.874 --> 42:06.209
I like her.

42:06.243 --> 42:08.112
Maybe we shouldn't compare
notes. How about that?

42:08.145 --> 42:09.947
No. I think that's
actually a perfect idea.

42:09.979 --> 42:11.948
Here you go. There we are.

42:11.982 --> 42:13.817
Prentiss, voice-over: "We
must be willing to let go"

42:13.850 --> 42:15.853
"of the life we've planned

42:15.886 --> 42:19.123
so as to have the life
that is waiting for us."

you're absolutely gorgeous.
