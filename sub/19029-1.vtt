WEBVTT

00:03.387 --> 00:06.731
<i>So there we were.
Elliott about to get married.</i>

00:07.252 --> 00:10.466
<i>Me about to have a baby with Kim.
careening toward to kiss.</i>

00:11.161 --> 00:14.878
<i>We're both terrified because either one
of us could back out the last second,</i>

00:14.879 --> 00:17.810
<i>leaving the other kissing the air,
and feeling like a fool.</i>

00:18.282 --> 00:23.830
<i>Ah, the point of no-return. The closing
of the eyes. Time to dive...</i>

00:25.839 --> 00:27.141
Elliott?

00:28.505 --> 00:30.198
JD, what are we doing?

00:30.762 --> 00:31.955
<i>How the hell d'she do that?</i>

00:34.480 --> 00:36.741
Look, what almost happened
in there is not about us.

00:36.935 --> 00:39.019
Of course not. Please... Us?

00:39.020 --> 00:41.379
We were both just on the verge
of making giant commitments,

00:41.423 --> 00:43.769
- and as usual we are freaking out.
- You're right, and you know what?

00:43.770 --> 00:46.020
We can't let fears
screw our relationships.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.687
Who wants to end like Snoop Dogg intern?
- Hey!

00:48.949 --> 00:50.785
- Sorry, Snoop Dogg resident.
- Hey!

00:51.178 --> 00:53.196
- Snoop Dogg attending?
- That's right, baby.

00:53.452 --> 00:56.046
All right. The point is he
hasnt' told Josephine

00:56.047 --> 00:57.931
that she gives him wowsers in his trousers.

00:58.908 --> 01:00.940
Hey, be cool, be cool man.
I'm working on it.

01:01.283 --> 01:04.440
I'm with you dog, just keep it real.
What do we do now?

01:04.787 --> 01:07.668
Nothing. Nothing happened, so we
never have to speak of this again.

01:08.284 --> 01:08.772
Hey!

01:09.137 --> 01:10.382
- Keith?
- Keith?

01:10.615 --> 01:11.366
<i>Keith?</i>

01:11.963 --> 01:13.588
<i>Wait, I was alrady
surprised out loud?</i>

01:14.132 --> 01:16.784
I was lonely at home, so I decided
to come by and say hi.

01:17.134 --> 01:18.059
Oooh!

01:18.889 --> 01:21.110
<i>And then I had one of those
weird, crystallizing moments</i>

01:21.111 --> 01:22.657
<i>when everything becomes so clear.</i>

01:22.976 --> 01:25.048
<i>I mean, I should've been relieved that
Keith haven't shown up earlier,</i>

01:25.049 --> 01:27.016
<i>and walked in on JD and me. But I wasn't.</i>

01:27.509 --> 01:30.093
<i>I wished he had caught us.
'Cause the truth is...</i>

01:32.460 --> 01:33.641
I don't wanna marry him.

01:33.706 --> 01:35.396
- Shut up!
- Uuuuuh!

01:36.329 --> 01:37.291
Honestly I think...

01:37.502 --> 01:40.707
I let it get this far because of how much
I wanna be married, you know.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.321
- God, I wanna be married.
- Baby...

01:45.596 --> 01:47.117
Hey, I'm sorry for barging in so late,

01:47.118 --> 01:49.280
I hope I didn't interrupt
anything important...

01:49.836 --> 01:51.825
- Oh...
- Actually, since I'm diabetic,

01:52.080 --> 01:54.371
Carla only lets me eat one
candy bar every 6 months,

01:54.372 --> 01:56.764
so she was helping me choose
which one to go with.

01:58.331 --> 02:01.777
First, we cut out all candy that sounds
remotely racist, which includes

02:01.821 --> 02:04.392
all jerk chocolate,
and I know this sounds weird but,

02:04.713 --> 02:06.454
JoojooBees.

02:06.789 --> 02:10.279
Then Carla was like "What about Junior 
Mints?", and I was like... "Junior Mints?"

02:10.717 --> 02:12.953
Baby, if I want my candy
to freshen my breath,

02:12.954 --> 02:15.213
I'd just lap some toothpaste on'em...
watch him to call and ball

02:15.242 --> 02:18.193
and go to town on that bad boy,
you know what I'm saying?

02:22.568 --> 02:25.001
She knows I'm changing the
subject 'cause she's sad.

02:25.671 --> 02:27.587
Come here, come here, Elliot.

02:28.469 --> 02:29.547
Hmmm, hmmm.

02:31.791 --> 02:32.338
No.

02:33.299 --> 02:33.948
Ok.

02:35.216 --> 02:36.404
What did he ask you?

02:37.322 --> 02:39.773
Oh, he just wanted to know if there's
anything I needed.

02:39.774 --> 02:40.943
Elliott?

02:41.197 --> 02:42.989
He asked me if they
still make Mars bars.

02:49.153 --> 02:51.687
Come on Bob, there's an empty
table right there.

02:51.928 --> 02:53.174
I'll leave for 10 dollars.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.324
Pleasure doing business.

02:58.071 --> 02:58.882
Hey, friends.

02:59.603 --> 03:00.739
What, are you bored up there?

03:00.854 --> 03:04.096
- So, how did it go with Keith?
- I haven't told him yet.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.101
His whole family's in town for the wedding,

03:06.102 --> 03:08.846
and so my house is filled as a freaking
Rafters with the Dudemaisters.

03:09.225 --> 03:11.716
You know how my college girlfriend,
Stacy, broke up with me?

03:12.058 --> 03:14.171
She arranged it so that when
I came home from class,

03:14.172 --> 03:17.522
I was able to see her riding in
pleasure beneath a big, brown butt.

03:18.055 --> 03:19.992
How many times do I have
to apologize for that?

03:19.993 --> 03:21.897
I still have nightmares about
your cheeks, Turk,

03:21.995 --> 03:25.455
just bouncing, and bouncing.
Can't sleep.

03:30.659 --> 03:32.706
Ok... now or never.

03:35.241 --> 03:35.897
Keith!

03:36.546 --> 03:38.602
Hey there, future Mrs. Dudemeister!

03:39.047 --> 03:41.687
Actually I'm not sure we decided whether
or not am I taking your last name.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.328
You know what? That's not important... Keith,

03:45.634 --> 03:46.968
we need to talk.

03:47.496 --> 03:50.831
- What's the matter?
- I don't even know how to start this...

03:52.192 --> 03:54.999
Keith, I've been thinking...

03:57.500 --> 04:01.141
- I don't feel right watching this.
- It's not just us...

Aww!

Aww!

04:18.572 --> 04:20.543
- JD!
- No, Snoop Dog attending,

04:20.543 --> 04:22.675
finally told Josephine how he feels.

04:27.197 --> 04:29.253
Aww!

04:29.806 --> 04:31.759
Hey, everybody, look. A rainbow.

Aww!

04:49.593 --> 04:51.999
It had been a while since
my near kiss with Elliot

04:52.000 --> 04:53.989
and the dust was finally starting to settle.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.322
- Daddy's home!
- Come here,

04:56.323 --> 04:58.655
check out these big pregnant apple feet.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.365
Wow! Those are truly disgusting.

05:01.591 --> 05:04.133
Right? I missed you.

05:04.745 --> 05:08.322
<i>Elliot had broken up with Keith and
everything looked great from me and Kim,</i>

05:08.843 --> 05:11.338
<i>still, to see how we got there,
I have to go back a week.</i>

05:12.285 --> 05:14.660
<i>One week earlier</i>

05:16.349 --> 05:17.490
So, how's Keith?

05:17.962 --> 05:19.587
Carla.
Pig whore.

05:20.126 --> 05:22.486
Better actually.
Used to be "Stupid Pig Whore".

05:22.562 --> 05:24.585
It's only been a few days and he's
already dropped an adjective.

05:24.959 --> 05:27.498
Wow! Maybe by the weekend
you'll just be "whore".

05:27.643 --> 05:30.295
Hey, Kim. I know because I work
we haven't seeing in a while,

05:30.296 --> 05:32.272
but do you mind if I grab
a drink with Turk, tonight?

05:32.370 --> 05:33.623
Tell'er my dad died.

05:33.982 --> 05:35.993
Go have fun with your friend.
I'm gonna stand in and eat.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.778
Thanks, babe. Bye.

05:38.301 --> 05:40.354
See Turk? Now we can see that dead didine

05:40.355 --> 05:42.276
and go to see the new panda baby at the zoo.

05:42.739 --> 05:46.082
- Oh, It's to late for that. She died.
- Not Ming Ming?

05:46.428 --> 05:50.173
- Her mama sat on her and then ate her.
- Stupid nature.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.677
I can't believe I almost messed things
up with Kim. What's wrong with me?

05:53.961 --> 05:55.855
You're an annoying, whining man-child.

05:56.311 --> 05:59.072
- That question wasn't directed to you!
- What question?

05:59.652 --> 06:05.293
Mr. Hotneck, I see here you were admitted
for swollen lymphnode and abdonimal pain.

06:05.570 --> 06:08.258
- I'm also having heart palpitations.
- Oh, I think I can help you with that.

06:08.259 --> 06:11.293
Well, you see, I'm very, very handsome.

06:11.429 --> 06:12.480
I was gonna say.

06:13.070 --> 06:15.196
Beardface, what you say?

06:15.553 --> 06:19.938
It's Beardface'! Why did you people
insist on calling me Beardface!

06:20.336 --> 06:22.214
- Ehm. may I?
- Go for it.

06:22.485 --> 06:24.547
Well, I-I just got here,
but if I had to guess

06:24.548 --> 06:27.528
I would say it's 'cause
your face is... 5/6 beard.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.471
Damn you!

06:30.923 --> 06:33.288
Carla, which resident ordered
a CAT scan on Mr. Herschlossning?

06:33.451 --> 06:38.142
That would be me, pig whore, it's on
the note. Oh, can't pig whore read?

06:38.691 --> 06:40.184
Ah, Pig Whore Reid!

06:40.869 --> 06:43.178
See, your last name is Reid,
so it works two ways.

06:43.477 --> 06:45.320
Keith's been totally unprofessional,

06:45.495 --> 06:48.140
And you were supposed to
marry him, last weekend?

06:48.410 --> 06:52.755
Speaking of which, I gave you a
very hied cappuccino maker,

06:52.756 --> 06:54.645
and seeing is there aren't
going to be any nuptials...

06:54.646 --> 06:56.787
- Yeah, yeah. You'll get it back.
- Great.

06:57.574 --> 07:00.335
Keith and I have to work toghether.
How am I supposed to fix this?

07:00.694 --> 07:03.533
You can't. You just gotta let
him hate you you for a while.

07:03.927 --> 07:07.118
No, we can get through this.
I'm gonna talk to him.

07:08.008 --> 07:08.947
Hey, wait a minute.

07:09.075 --> 07:11.600
We've only got one cappuccino
maker and it was from my brother Barry.

07:11.940 --> 07:12.818
Worth the shot.

07:13.443 --> 07:14.987
Sorry, you gonna answer me or not?

07:15.344 --> 07:17.945
Come on, man. You know why you
almost screwed things up with Kim,

07:18.023 --> 07:20.747
- don't make me say it.
- Hi fine. The heart truth rule is in effect.

07:20.757 --> 07:23.835
Only heart truth on me, so you
will wanna me or you'll feel guilty.

07:23.864 --> 07:26.879
- JD, we don't even...
- When you sweat a lot, you smell like eggs.

07:27.683 --> 07:29.228
That's not even true!

07:30.007 --> 07:32.863
- Did Carla tell you to say that?
- No, why, did she think that too?

07:34.258 --> 07:35.399
No.

07:36.369 --> 07:38.450
All right, fine. You wanna know
why you are almost blowed with Kim?

07:38.860 --> 07:40.612
That's because your knocked
her up on your first date,

07:40.613 --> 07:42.970
and before you could get to know her,
she betraded you.

07:43.885 --> 07:45.634
Now you don't have strong feelings for her

07:45.635 --> 07:48.753
and the only reason why you guys are still
together is because there's a kid envolved.

07:49.393 --> 07:53.439
Which means you gonna stick it out with
her till the end whether you love her or not.

07:54.383 --> 07:55.509
I don't know man, I don't think that's true.

07:55.510 --> 07:57.446
I don't think it's about her.
I think it's about me.

07:57.654 --> 08:00.532
I've sabotaged every relationship I've
ever been in. Look at it.

08:00.669 --> 08:04.341
Mole-butt, Tina two-kids,
Rumple-fuggly, Gift-shop Girl.

08:04.508 --> 08:07.583
None of those girls were good
for you anyway. Except for Mole-butt.

08:08.683 --> 08:11.830
- I didn't even know Rumple-fuggly was a girl!
- Stop it! Fug was awesome.

08:13.746 --> 08:16.129
Lyme disease and...
how on Earth

08:16.130 --> 08:19.757
could I possibly have figured out such a
tough diagnosis so darn quickly?

08:19.964 --> 08:23.298
Because I'm that good.
One more time for emphasis...

08:23.659 --> 08:26.462
I'm that good.
Wooooo!

08:26.815 --> 08:29.810
Now I'm gonna have this incredibly
fun-size intern

08:29.811 --> 08:32.743
give you quick body-check
for tick bites, tip-toes?

08:33.654 --> 08:34.907
Oh, she-she's cute.

08:35.106 --> 08:38.719
And once she has found the telltale
bullseye shaped mark

08:38.905 --> 08:41.767
we'll be able to start trigging you.
How does that sound, Mr Hotneck?

08:42.285 --> 08:44.210
Please... call me Joe.

08:51.104 --> 08:53.628
- Gotta get that guy out of here.
- Why? Is he a jerk?

08:53.721 --> 08:56.338
No, I... I think I like him.

08:56.839 --> 08:59.643
- What smells like eggs?
- Nothing sir, you're imagining.

08:59.963 --> 09:02.400
- What's wrong with liking a patient?
- I'm not you.

09:02.401 --> 09:05.767
I don't get to introduce myself to
patients, do a minor surgery,

09:05.768 --> 09:08.612
recommend a good mortician
to family and that just be on my way.

09:08.613 --> 09:11.301
I have to treat people, and If I like them

09:11.302 --> 09:13.509
well, that makes me wanna
work harder much harder.

09:13.749 --> 09:15.707
Really... who has time for that, right?

09:16.797 --> 09:17.362
Seriously...

09:17.986 --> 09:20.451
Am I having a stroke or is
someone making an homelette?

09:28.630 --> 09:29.288
Hey Keith.

09:29.749 --> 09:31.910
You came to your house while
I'm packing all my stuff,

09:31.911 --> 09:33.494
even though you promised not to be here.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.221
Awesome.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.380
Well, you know you can't take my word.
I mean, I also

09:38.381 --> 09:42.042
promised to marry you last
Saturday, right? Right?

09:43.554 --> 09:45.528
I know... too soon. I'm sorry.

09:46.310 --> 09:48.998
But, come on. We loved too-soon jokes.

09:49.404 --> 09:50.748
Come on now.

09:51.514 --> 09:55.531
Let's see the chuckle... Uh? Here it comes...

09:56.027 --> 09:58.940
I think I see it... bubbling up!

09:59.030 --> 10:02.162
You're not making me start laughing.
Because you know that if I start laugh...

10:03.108 --> 10:04.805
You start!

10:07.869 --> 10:10.452
Ok, you know what, this is why
was so easy to walk out on you.

10:14.161 --> 10:17.998
- I finally figured out what's wrong with me.
- You're an annoying whiny man-child.

10:19.191 --> 10:20.836
I'm a self-saboteur.

10:21.128 --> 10:24.958
And not just in relationships. In everything.
But you know what? I'm done with all that.

10:25.213 --> 10:27.676
I'm not gonna shoot myself
in the foot anymore.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.454
- What is it, funsize?
- I checked Mr Hotneck all over,

10:31.514 --> 10:34.089
- but I couldn't find the tick bite.
- Oh my God.

10:34.476 --> 10:36.269
I gotta go figure this out.
I can't believe...

10:36.270 --> 10:39.785
Oh, and by the way, you've a
ridicolous speaking voice, did you...

10:40.774 --> 10:43.339
<i>And even tough I wanted to ask Snoop
how he could spend a second</i>

10:43.340 --> 10:45.378
<i>listening to that voice
without killing himself,</i>

10:45.379 --> 10:49.359
<i>I didn't. Yep! No more bringing trouble
my way by saying things like:</i>

10:49.637 --> 10:51.844
- Who are the flowers for?
- My girlfriend.

10:52.484 --> 10:54.872
- You've a girlfriend?
- Just cause I'm Janitor means

10:54.873 --> 10:57.447
- No woman could possibly
be attracted to me? - Noooo.

10:57.898 --> 10:58.972
<i>Yees.</i>

10:59.422 --> 11:00.714
There she is, right down there.

11:03.177 --> 11:04.867
Really? What's her name?

11:06.106 --> 11:08.719
- Lady.
- Lady?

11:09.116 --> 11:10.610
- You don't believe me?
- Well, let's just say

11:10.611 --> 11:11.706
you've lied to me before.

11:12.052 --> 11:12.661
Watch this.

11:14.117 --> 11:15.356
Hey lady!

11:19.547 --> 11:22.859
Stay there. Don't... Don't come down here.
I'll get these to you later.

11:24.759 --> 11:25.570
You witness.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.173
- Just pick a candy, T-dog.
- Shut up!

11:30.623 --> 11:32.546
You've no idea how
important this is to me.

11:35.256 --> 11:38.703
<i>And then I had this weird...
crystalizing moment.</i>

11:40.903 --> 11:43.989
<i>I realized... I didn't have
to choose the candy.</i>

11:45.926 --> 11:47.728
I could just let the candy choose me.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.056
- So what you get?
- Bit O'Honey.

11:50.244 --> 11:53.173
- Oh! I'm so, so sorry.
- Don't be.

11:53.608 --> 11:55.697
I ate that bad boy and
I own a half going on,

11:55.698 --> 11:57.859
I'm still pulling bits of it out of my teeth.

11:58.378 --> 12:00.726
Oh my God, Gandhidiot.
We'd be all be better served

12:00.727 --> 12:02.748
if we fill this patient with the
creamy caramel center.

12:02.749 --> 12:05.213
Then, would you tell me
whether or not he needs surgery?

12:05.370 --> 12:07.848
It's not an acute abdomen,
so it's not a surgical issue.

12:07.931 --> 12:09.606
Why can't anyone figure
out what's wrong with me?

12:10.169 --> 12:11.475
I won't let you down.

12:13.082 --> 12:16.882
- I'm sorry I can't help Mr. Hotneck.
- Oh, please, call me Joe.

12:21.732 --> 12:24.060
I'm so sight to call him Joe.

12:24.090 --> 12:27.424
- He's got this magical quality too.
- Uh, you telling me?

12:27.946 --> 12:29.552
- What can I do to help?
- Gumbo,

12:29.553 --> 12:31.956
I honestly don't know what to do next.

12:32.508 --> 12:33.033
I do.

12:33.157 --> 12:35.702
<i>Some phrases stink, no
matter how the're said.</i>

12:36.078 --> 12:37.843
<i>They can be barked by a sworn enemy.</i>

12:37.955 --> 12:38.841
Get the hell out of here!

12:42.814 --> 12:45.585
<i>Or hissed by a gilted ex stealing a lamp.</i>

12:46.306 --> 12:47.621
Elliot, just get the hell out of here!

12:49.933 --> 12:53.478
<i>Or even plainly stated in a
veteran doctor suading tone.</i>

12:53.771 --> 12:56.204
Goodbye everybody, I'll see you tomorrow!

12:56.932 --> 12:57.916
<i>Not her!</i>

12:58.487 --> 13:02.850
Fellows. If your symptoms have subsided
and you can't find an underline cause,

13:02.999 --> 13:07.708
his insurance won't cover. You have to tell
Mr. Hotneck to get the hell out of here.

13:16.050 --> 13:16.688
Hey Joe.

13:21.269 --> 13:23.943
<i>When someone tells you to get the hell
out, you don't have a lot of options.</i>

13:24.573 --> 13:25.587
<i>You can ignore them...</i>

13:25.776 --> 13:26.579
Where are you taking me?

13:26.774 --> 13:29.703
Joe, we're turfing you to dermatology
to buy ourselves some time.

13:29.704 --> 13:31.144
Gandhi, how's that mole looking?

13:31.926 --> 13:33.729
- Nice and cancerous.
- Well done!

13:35.237 --> 13:36.882
<i>Or you can take a more direct approach.</i>

13:37.024 --> 13:40.088
- No, Keith. I'm not leaving.
- Oh, awesome.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.761
Why does it have to be like this?

13:44.113 --> 13:45.585
I care about you so much.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.596
I don't wanna lose you for my life.

13:49.205 --> 13:53.350
Well, you're going to. Because, from
now on, Pigwhore, you're dead to me.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.652
- You did what?!?
- I know... I am a pigwhore.

14:06.874 --> 14:07.722
What am I going to do now?

14:08.795 --> 14:10.943
Would you two kindly shut
your respective cakeholes?

14:10.958 --> 14:13.188
We're trying to figure out
what's wrong with Joe, here.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.983
Big news, Sports' Fans!

14:16.027 --> 14:19.061
I decided to start calling
everyone Sports' Fans.

14:19.594 --> 14:23.890
Yeah, I know I'm not exactly the jokey
tipe but I watched Hoosiers last night,

14:24.093 --> 14:27.682
and I like sports now.
Anybody have any objections?

14:28.366 --> 14:30.761
Marjory? Shocking.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.779
You're usually the one who has...
something to say about everything...

14:35.671 --> 14:37.781
I know you're the one who started
the rumor that I like dudes.

14:39.089 --> 14:45.886
Allright, Sports' Fans! I've almost gone an
entire day without sabotaging myself. Hello?

14:46.254 --> 14:47.117
That's it!

14:48.128 --> 14:52.814
Ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the first
annual Sacred Heart "Who-cares-ease" Awards,

14:52.867 --> 14:54.991
designed to honour those people who believe

14:54.992 --> 14:58.634
that others actually give a rat's ass
about the manushia of their lives.

14:59.415 --> 15:01.803
<i>The weird thing was I think
we all really wanted to win.</i>

15:02.261 --> 15:04.303
And the nominees are...

15:04.964 --> 15:08.336
Barby Reid for: "What am I
going to do about my ex-fiancee".

15:11.149 --> 15:15.012
Dame Judy Dorian for: "I'm
done self-sabotaging".

15:17.963 --> 15:20.246
Gandhi for: "I've got
candy in my teeth".

15:23.392 --> 15:25.480
The Todd for: "Look at my new shirt".

15:25.983 --> 15:28.649
<i>SHHH!!!
DONG SLEEPING</i>

15:31.900 --> 15:33.162
<i>And the winner is...</i>

15:34.633 --> 15:36.000
Dame Judy Dorian!

15:37.524 --> 15:40.445
<i>This is Dame Judy Dorian's
first nomination and first win.</i>

15:44.801 --> 15:47.196
<i>Suck on that, Tony Shalhoub!</i>

15:47.714 --> 15:52.070
Perry, why the hell is Hotneck
still here? Put him on the street.

15:52.303 --> 15:55.712
You win. But would you do us a favour and
you deliver the news to Hotneck yourself?

15:55.997 --> 15:56.944
I'll be glad to.

16:00.954 --> 16:03.740
Hi. I'm Bob Kelso. Mr. Hotneck, is it?

16:03.980 --> 16:05.670
Please, call me Joe.

16:12.849 --> 16:16.618
Think, fellows, think. We have to
figure out what's wrong with Joe.

16:17.550 --> 16:21.102
<i>I've done it! An entire day
without sabotaging myself.</i>

16:21.327 --> 16:23.887
I'm sorry, but I don't
even know who you are.

16:25.578 --> 16:29.903
Ohoh! It seems like a strange thing
for a girlfriend to say, isn't it?

16:30.376 --> 16:32.651
Hold on one second,
I've to grab this. Yello?

16:33.312 --> 16:38.283
Oh yes, he's here. It's the Truth calling.
Wants to know why you never tell it.

16:38.876 --> 16:44.200
Ah! I mean really, who are you?
A necklace of my name on it?

16:44.703 --> 16:47.406
The man I met was sweet
but I had no idea how sweet.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.063
Ah! You got to get some! Ah!

16:55.457 --> 16:57.237
Just had to do the phone bid, didn't ya?

16:58.109 --> 16:59.791
- Her name's Lady?
- Yeah.

17:00.242 --> 17:02.044
- Whose name's Lady?
- She is.

17:02.464 --> 17:04.364
She's got a brother named Him,
what do you care?

17:05.242 --> 17:07.969
Seriously, why do you force me
to make your life miserable?

17:09.064 --> 17:10.769
And I really didn't have an answer for him.

17:11.127 --> 17:14.423
You know what I don't have an answer for? Why
I'm going to line-dancing with Keith tonight.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.933
Stupid pig-whore.

17:16.332 --> 17:19.269
- JD, you're not that self-destructed.
- Really?

17:19.929 --> 17:21.851
I was gonna suggest
he'd seek professional help.

17:23.045 --> 17:25.140
Would you be interested in
seeing a kindative therapist?

17:25.576 --> 17:26.612
'Cause I know a guy, he's good,

17:26.770 --> 17:28.655
and he give you his card,
then I'm gonna bash your head in.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.689
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Timing at 7.

17:30.825 --> 17:31.652
Well, on it.

17:32.328 --> 17:34.656
Screw it. I'm just gonna marry Keith.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.366
- Maybe he'll die young...
- When did we become

17:37.367 --> 17:39.311
such ridiculous, pathetic people?

17:39.513 --> 17:41.841
Why do you two think you're
different from anyone else?

17:42.013 --> 17:45.190
JD, I get it my way all the time.
Like this morning, I was getting late,

17:45.219 --> 17:48.929
and I got toothpaste on my upper lip, and
even though I knew Turk was watching,

17:49.159 --> 17:51.314
I didn't wipe it off with
my hand, I went like this:

17:53.004 --> 17:54.108
Huh, 'morning.

17:55.482 --> 17:59.957
And Elliot, I'm sorry but you're not the
first person that ever slept with her ex, ok?

18:01.084 --> 18:03.179
- Is there a point in this?
- Yes...

18:03.638 --> 18:07.715
And pay attention, because I don't
wanna be saying that in 2 weeks:

18:08.504 --> 18:13.032
You're bot humans... give
yourselves a break, ok?

18:25.684 --> 18:26.615
Fair enough.

18:26.735 --> 18:30.220
I can't look at these medical books
anymore. We're getting nowhere.

18:31.812 --> 18:35.011
- How d'you do, BeardFace?
- It's Beardface'.

18:35.725 --> 18:38.668
- Beardface'.
- Calm down, Seymour.

18:39.081 --> 18:43.001
If you wanna lose the nickname,
you gotta shave the beard. 'Course,

18:43.887 --> 18:47.544
- then you'd be Doctor Face!
- Ha! Doctor Face.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.009
Damn you all!

18:49.992 --> 18:51.873
I wonder what he's hiding
under all that hair.

18:52.294 --> 18:53.015
That's it!

18:53.334 --> 18:56.878
- What's it?
- Interns are idiots. Ockham's... razor.

18:59.236 --> 19:00.039
There you are.

19:00.626 --> 19:01.999
Uhm, do you wanna go straight out,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.802
or do you wanna go back to our
place, and get some food first?

19:05.253 --> 19:06.581
We have to talk.

19:07.324 --> 19:09.870
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I have to do this again.

19:10.185 --> 19:13.512
- Do what again, babe?
- Well, uhm...

19:18.426 --> 19:22.058
- Feel so bad for them.
- Mwah, me too.

19:22.801 --> 19:26.217
<i>But actually I never really cared
for Keith, or his farm boy looks,</i>

19:26.218 --> 19:27.794
<i>but now it wasn't time for that.</i>

19:30.640 --> 19:31.181
Hey, Kim.

19:31.721 --> 19:34.673
Get your butt home, already. We
haven't seen each other in days.

19:35.657 --> 19:36.648
But you missed me?

19:36.964 --> 19:38.003
Of course I do.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.230
<i>But the truth was I didn't.</i>

19:41.108 --> 19:43.661
<i>And then I had this weird,
cristallyzing moment,</i>

19:44.563 --> 19:47.634
<i>you see, there's an ancient principle
you hear a lot about medicine:</i>

19:48.066 --> 19:51.697
<i>that the simplest, most obvious
answer is usually the correct one.</i>

19:52.117 --> 19:53.589
<i>It's called "Ockham's Razor!"</i>

19:54.738 --> 19:57.966
<i>It could mean your first thing think
was right, and it was Leym's disease.</i>

19:58.252 --> 20:02.036
Bullseye!And there's kickpie. Let's put
him on a hundred milligrams of ceftine.

20:02.037 --> 20:03.862
Joe, you're gonna be fine.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.430
Thank you, guys. Sincerely.

20:07.991 --> 20:09.456
<i>Or that your best 
friend was right.</i>

20:09.997 --> 20:12.415
<i>And you have to let you
ex-fiancee hate you for a while.</i>

20:12.963 --> 20:14.990
Goodnight, you skanky
scorehair pig whore.

20:16.011 --> 20:17.836
Did you hear all the new adjectives?

20:18.339 --> 20:19.150
Come here.

20:20.343 --> 20:23.587
- You're not scorehair.
- I know...

20:26.118 --> 20:28.634
<i>In my case, it was never
about sabotaging myself.</i>

20:29.798 --> 20:31.231
- Daddy's home.
- Come here.

20:31.232 --> 20:33.395
Check out these big 
pregnant hiperfeet.

20:34.364 --> 20:36.474
- Wow, those are truly disgusting.
- Right?!

20:36.556 --> 20:39.132
I missed you.

20:41.768 --> 20:43.713
<i>It was the simple answer,
just like Turk said.</i>

20:44.133 --> 20:45.838
<i>I had knocked up a
girl on our first date,</i>

20:46.522 --> 20:49.157
<i>and I don't have strong feelings
for her, and probably never will.</i>

20:50.074 --> 20:53.010
<i>And the only reason we're still together
is because there's a kid involved,</i>

20:53.048 --> 20:56.006
<i>which means I'm gonna stay
with her, until the very end,</i>

20:57.160 --> 20:59.616
<i>whether I love her, or not.</i>
