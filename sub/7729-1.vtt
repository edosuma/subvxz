Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

04:27.213 --> 04:30.341
They're crap, squirrel.
They fall apart before you're out of the door.

04:30.416 --> 04:33.010
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

04:33.086 --> 04:34.986
Please.

04:35.054 --> 04:38.649
My sister, she's very, very sick.

04:38.725 --> 04:41.853
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

04:41.928 --> 04:44.954
- Do you know my mother?
- No.

04:45.031 --> 04:48.660
She's very, very sick.

04:48.735 --> 04:50.726
I'll give you two.

04:52.939 --> 04:55.271
That's a bad idea, you know.

04:55.341 --> 04:58.799
Like feeding pigeons.

05:01.681 --> 05:05.481
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

05:05.552 --> 05:08.043
I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

05:08.121 --> 05:11.352
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.

05:11.424 --> 05:13.358
And I didn't answer.

05:13.426 --> 05:16.862
There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

05:16.930 --> 05:19.524
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

05:19.599 --> 05:22.227
No, it's not possible.

05:22.302 --> 05:24.862
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

05:24.938 --> 05:27.304
but they never got that far south.

05:27.373 --> 05:30.171
Nevertheless, there it sits.

05:30.243 --> 05:33.144
The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

05:33.213 --> 05:35.374
We believe a rare object waits inside.

05:35.448 --> 05:38.645
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

[Thunder Rumbling]

05:44.657 --> 05:48.058
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

05:48.127 --> 05:50.823
No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

05:50.897 --> 05:53.024
in everything except himself.

05:53.099 --> 05:56.068
Ah.
You know nothing about me.

05:56.135 --> 05:58.365

06:00.673 --> 06:04.507
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

06:12.619 --> 06:16.111
This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

06:16.189 --> 06:20.091

of a mythical demon.

It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

06:41.547 --> 06:44.243
A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

06:44.317 --> 06:47.218
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

06:47.287 --> 06:50.085
You're assuming that I will say yes.

06:50.156 --> 06:52.716

07:29.429 --> 07:31.590
Beautiful, aren't they?

07:31.664 --> 07:34.565
It's a hobby from school days.

07:34.634 --> 07:36.966
Works wonders for the nerves.

07:37.036 --> 07:39.368
You should try it sometime.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.370
What can you tell me about the dig?

07:44.811 --> 07:48.508
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

07:48.581 --> 07:50.446
called Derati.

07:50.516 --> 07:54.145
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

07:54.220 --> 07:56.154
on maneuvers there.

07:56.222 --> 07:59.623
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

08:01.227 --> 08:04.219
What have they learned so far?

08:04.297 --> 08:08.825
That it's a church
where no church should be.

08:08.901 --> 08:11.301
This is Father Francis.

08:11.371 --> 08:13.999
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

08:14.073 --> 08:17.065
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

08:17.143 --> 08:20.374
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

08:22.015 --> 08:24.848
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

08:24.917 --> 08:29.854
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

08:29.922 --> 08:33.380
[Chuckles] I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

08:33.458 --> 08:35.450
when Rome learned of the discovery.

08:35.528 --> 08:39.828
They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

08:39.899 --> 08:42.197
Hmm.

08:42.268 --> 08:45.260
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

08:45.338 --> 08:47.101
We haven't...

08:47.173 --> 08:49.368
officially.

08:49.442 --> 08:52.275
You're both my guests.

08:52.345 --> 08:55.712
Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

08:55.782 --> 08:57.943
Well, not until I've seen it.

08:58.017 --> 09:01.214
Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

09:01.287 --> 09:04.415
I'm afraid not.

09:04.490 --> 09:06.924
We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

09:13.933 --> 09:16.595
[Chattering]

09:23.009 --> 09:26.069
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.

09:26.145 --> 09:29.478
The British hired me as an interpreter.

09:33.519 --> 09:36.317
What happened here?

09:36.389 --> 09:39.825
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

09:39.892 --> 09:43.658
- How many died?
- All of them.

- [Fly Buzzing]
- [Dog Barking]

10:42.054 --> 10:44.784
I'm Lancaster Merrin.

10:44.857 --> 10:48.054
Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

10:48.127 --> 10:51.619
He did.

10:53.099 --> 10:56.034
Is something bothering you, mate?

10:58.371 --> 11:00.862
No.

11:00.940 --> 11:04.467
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?

11:04.544 --> 11:06.842
I shouldn't...

11:06.913 --> 11:09.404
but my will is weak.

11:10.616 --> 11:13.346
Then you might just survive this place.

11:14.887 --> 11:17.617
I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

11:17.690 --> 11:20.056
but that progress has slowed down.

11:20.126 --> 11:22.094
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

11:25.898 --> 11:29.390
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster-- Lancaster Merrin.

11:31.170 --> 11:34.264
You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

11:34.340 --> 11:38.834
I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

11:38.911 --> 11:41.937
Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

11:42.014 --> 11:43.948
How about a muzzle?

11:49.655 --> 11:52.283
So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

11:52.358 --> 11:54.826
- They're not.
- No?

11:54.894 --> 11:57.055
Has the structure collapsed?

11:57.129 --> 11:59.256
No, the church is perfect...

11:59.332 --> 12:02.028
but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

12:02.101 --> 12:04.467
Why's that?

12:05.871 --> 12:10.069
I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

12:14.647 --> 12:19.311
Well... pleasant fellow.

12:19.385 --> 12:21.785
What's wrong with his face?

12:21.854 --> 12:25.085
Other than that it's
attached to his body?

12:25.157 --> 12:28.456
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind oflocalized infection.

12:28.527 --> 12:32.463
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

12:32.531 --> 12:35.523
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

12:35.601 --> 12:38.729
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?

12:40.139 --> 12:42.664
No. I'm a doctor.

12:42.742 --> 12:45.734
But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

12:45.811 --> 12:47.836
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

12:47.913 --> 12:49.904
Now, that's funny.

12:49.982 --> 12:52.815
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

12:52.885 --> 12:56.252
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

12:57.890 --> 13:00.154

Father Merrin.

13:05.398 --> 13:08.993
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

13:09.068 --> 13:11.866
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

13:11.937 --> 13:15.668
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

13:15.741 --> 13:18.801
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

13:18.878 --> 13:21.972
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.

13:22.048 --> 13:24.846
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.545

Is this your first assignment, Father?

14:33.285 --> 14:36.618

in the archives in the Holy Sea.

14:36.689 --> 14:39.089

Impressive.

14:39.158 --> 14:42.150
But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

15:04.150 --> 15:06.414
This is strange.

15:06.485 --> 15:09.886
It's 1,500 years old.

15:09.955 --> 15:12.253
It should be badly weathered.

15:12.324 --> 15:16.385
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

15:16.462 --> 15:19.454
Chuma.

15:19.532 --> 15:22.729

[Growling]

15:28.007 --> 15:29.634

15:29.708 --> 15:31.835
They've been here
ever since we started digging.

15:31.911 --> 15:34.903
- Even at daytime?
- [Gasps]

16:10.850 --> 16:14.308
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

16:14.386 --> 16:17.844
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

16:17.923 --> 16:21.154
I think you're about
ready for this now.

16:23.395 --> 16:26.057
It's a tool for professional diggers.

16:26.131 --> 16:28.395
Wow.

16:31.437 --> 16:33.371
His seizure's stopped.

16:33.439 --> 16:36.431
I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

16:36.509 --> 16:39.501
but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

16:40.846 --> 16:43.872
Well, that must make
your job very hard.

16:43.949 --> 16:45.940
You have no idea.

16:48.287 --> 16:50.414
Thank you.

16:50.489 --> 16:53.390
So what is it you hope to find here?

16:53.459 --> 16:58.192
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

16:59.665 --> 17:03.567
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

17:03.636 --> 17:06.230

Bloody savages!

without instruction.

- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.

17:13.979 --> 17:17.574
I, uh-- I found this...

17:17.650 --> 17:19.880
and, uh, I want you to have it.

17:19.952 --> 17:22.944
It's a St.Joseph, for luck.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.190
Please, for my behavior.

17:32.298 --> 17:36.064
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

17:36.135 --> 17:39.366
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

17:39.438 --> 17:42.134
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

17:44.476 --> 17:47.604
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.841
It's okay. Come.

17:49.915 --> 17:52.406
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

17:52.484 --> 17:54.418
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

17:54.486 --> 17:56.249
A few days.

17:56.322 --> 18:00.156
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.

18:00.225 --> 18:02.659
Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

19:08.694 --> 19:11.822
[Grunting]

19:14.433 --> 19:16.424
Following us, Father?

19:18.103 --> 19:21.470
Is it safe to walk around?

19:21.540 --> 19:23.531
Let's see.

Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

19:46.298 --> 19:49.290
Cast out after the war in heaven.

Can't even trust angels, can you?

19:51.837 --> 19:54.567
[Screeching]

20:03.716 --> 20:07.049
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

20:08.921 --> 20:11.014
It's odd.

20:16.328 --> 20:19.092
Churches were built to exalt heaven...

20:19.164 --> 20:22.998
but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

20:26.805 --> 20:28.739
Look behind you, Father.

Desecration of Christ.

20:53.899 --> 20:56.424
Who would do something like this?

20:58.303 --> 21:02.137
The crucifix
was broken off from here.

21:02.207 --> 21:04.675
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

21:04.743 --> 21:06.643
I wouldn't know.

21:06.712 --> 21:09.306
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

21:09.381 --> 21:13.181
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

21:13.252 --> 21:16.983
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

21:17.055 --> 21:19.853
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

No one's been inside Bession's tent

- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.

22:53.018 --> 22:57.011
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.

- And he can read and write Aramaic?

at the time of Christ.

23:03.161 --> 23:06.460

23:49.641 --> 23:52.508
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

23:52.577 --> 23:55.512
Or maybe something
more substantial?

23:55.580 --> 23:57.810
Yes, that would be very nice.

23:59.251 --> 24:01.617

24:04.022 --> 24:06.752
I found them here when I arrived.

24:12.364 --> 24:15.265
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

24:17.569 --> 24:20.094
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

24:24.209 --> 24:27.872
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

24:27.946 --> 24:30.414
He had no medical symptoms...

24:30.482 --> 24:35.146
nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

24:35.220 --> 24:38.451
His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

24:38.523 --> 24:41.356
That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

24:41.426 --> 24:43.792

25:11.423 --> 25:14.051
When the Nazis started
rounding up theJews in our town...

25:14.126 --> 25:17.152
he didn't hesitate.

25:17.229 --> 25:19.356
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

25:19.431 --> 25:21.524
But someone turned us in...

25:21.600 --> 25:24.535
and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

25:24.603 --> 25:26.332
I'm sorry.

25:26.405 --> 25:30.136

understand, can they?

25:30.208 --> 25:32.836

25:35.347 --> 25:37.338
No.

25:39.951 --> 25:42.784
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

25:42.854 --> 25:48.019
I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

25:48.093 --> 25:52.086
One night I realized
I-- I had to tell him the truth...

25:52.164 --> 25:54.655
about... the Nazis...

25:54.733 --> 25:57.725
and what they did to me.

25:57.803 --> 26:01.432
After that, he never touched me again.

26:01.506 --> 26:04.805
So...

26:04.876 --> 26:07.902
what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

26:09.414 --> 26:12.440
I don't know.
I suppose I--

26:12.517 --> 26:16.851
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

26:16.922 --> 26:19.390
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

26:19.458 --> 26:21.619
No.

26:21.693 --> 26:25.060
There's no point in that.

26:25.130 --> 26:28.327
Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

26:36.975 --> 26:38.966
I should get to bed.

26:42.414 --> 26:45.815

- Gionetti?

26:50.489 --> 26:52.980
He runs the sanitarium.

26:53.058 --> 26:55.856
