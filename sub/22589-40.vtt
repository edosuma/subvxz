00:10.553 --> 00:11.721
<i>It's 11</i> a.m...

00:11.888 --> 00:14.557
<i>...and the graduating class
at Aaron Burr High School...</i>

00:14.724 --> 00:16.851
<i>...has a very special speaker.</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:19.854
But the one thing you must remember
as you go out into the world...

00:20.021 --> 00:23.691
...to face the challenge of higher education
in our great universities...

00:23.900 --> 00:27.570
...is always to obey the law
and support your local police.

00:27.946 --> 00:31.366
Good citizenship is its own reward.

00:39.249 --> 00:40.959
There he is, Pussycat.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.710
Do your duty.

00:42.919 --> 00:44.420
He's kind of cute.

00:44.921 --> 00:49.676
Say, Why'd you get me involved
in this anyway, Catwoman?

00:49.842 --> 00:54.889
Well, Batman has his protégé
and you're mine.

00:55.098 --> 00:58.476
But I'm just a rock 'n' roll singer.
I'm not a crook.

00:58.685 --> 01:00.395
Oh, forget it.

01:00.603 --> 01:04.190
You're 20 years old.
You're over the hill.

01:04.399 --> 01:08.903
Now, you just do as I tell you
and scratch a way into his heart.

01:14.409 --> 01:16.327
Uh, excuse me.

01:16.578 --> 01:17.787
Can I help you, miss?

01:17.996 --> 01:20.290
My name is Pussycat.

01:20.707 --> 01:23.042
And I wanna be alone with you, Robin.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.211
Alone with me? But why?

01:25.628 --> 01:30.633
I can see a very important part
of your education has been grossly neglected.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.720
That's a funny-looking outfit you're wearing.

01:33.928 --> 01:37.265
I could say the same for you, big boy.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.267
Anything in particular you want'?

01:40.143 --> 01:43.062
Only you, Boy Wonder.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.233
She's done it.

01:48.443 --> 01:50.778
Now, let's see if cataphrenic really works.

01:57.452 --> 01:59.621
Hello, baby. You're a real cute trick.

02:00.455 --> 02:03.416
- It works.
-Yeah. Ha-ha. Ooh.

02:03.625 --> 02:06.419
Hey, fellas, there's Chief O'Hara. Look out.

02:07.337 --> 02:08.545
Hello there, Boy Wonder.

02:08.755 --> 02:10.214
Oh, who's your friend?

02:10.423 --> 02:12.592
- What's it to you, fella?
-What?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.261
Get out of my way,
or I'll give you a fat lip.

02:15.470 --> 02:18.931
What have you done to him,
you little banshee?

02:23.102 --> 02:25.146
Come on, gorgeous.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.316
Frankly, I'm worried.

02:34.614 --> 02:35.657
Yes, commissioner.

02:35.865 --> 02:39.410
I don't know how to tell you this, Batman,
but Robin--

02:39.619 --> 02:42.330
Don't mince words, commissioner.
I can take it.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.333
Well, Robin attacked Chief O'Hara today
at the high school.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.960
Why would he do that?
What was his reason?

02:48.127 --> 02:51.381
- He escaped before we could learn anything.
<i>- And</i> Chief O'Hara?

02:51.589 --> 02:54.509
Well, he had the wind knocked out of him,
but he's recovered.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.469
I'll be right there.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074

04:06.038 --> 04:08.124
It was as though the devil had taken him.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.169
He was trifling
with some little red-headed girl...

04:11.335 --> 04:13.421
...and he answered my greeting
by tripping me.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.339
Who could have put him up
to such a dastardly deed?

04:16.507 --> 04:19.469
Chief O'Hara, had you ever seen
this titian-haired wench before?

04:19.677 --> 04:21.721
- Never.
- Mm.

04:21.887 --> 04:26.142
It could be we have a new villainess
to wreak havoc on Gotham City.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.436
Well, now, that's hard to say,
Caped Crusader.

04:28.603 --> 04:31.564
She couldn't have been more than 18,
give or take four years.

04:31.731 --> 04:33.691
Kind of young for crime business.

04:33.858 --> 04:36.694
In today's rapidly changing world,
one never knows.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.279
You can say that again.

04:38.488 --> 04:41.824
Before we set brain and sinew
to this perplexing case...

04:41.991 --> 04:44.202
...let's review all the facts.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.998
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, at stately Wayne Manor...</i>

04:49.373 --> 04:51.626
- Alfred?
-Yes, madam?

04:51.834 --> 04:55.129
I know I shouldn't ask you this...

04:55.379 --> 04:59.342
...but why am I not allowed
in Bruce's study?

04:59.675 --> 05:01.677
Uh, well, madam...

05:01.844 --> 05:05.640
...every man likes to have someplace
that is, uh, a sanctuary.

05:05.807 --> 05:09.936
Far away from the, uh,
if you pardon the expression, opposite sex.

05:10.102 --> 05:14.482
Now, uh, for those less fortunate
than Mr. Wayne, it's the barbershop.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.067
For him, his study.

05:16.567 --> 05:21.322
A masculine retreat
far from the threat of female encroachment.

05:23.074 --> 05:24.450
- Oh.
-Stay right where you are...

05:24.617 --> 05:26.160
...and don't make a move.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.454
Robin, tie them up.

05:28.663 --> 05:32.708
Mercy alive.
What's Robin doing with Catwoman?

05:32.917 --> 05:35.503
Same thought crossed my mind, madam.

05:40.424 --> 05:41.968
You-- You--

05:42.176 --> 05:44.262
Shut up, old man.

05:44.971 --> 05:46.848
Ha-ha. Ooh.

05:47.306 --> 05:51.269
Never thought the day would come
when Robin would be my sycophant...

05:51.853 --> 05:52.895
...did you?

05:53.062 --> 05:56.482
Oh, dear,
is there anything left to believe in?

05:57.984 --> 06:00.236
- All done, Catwoman.
-Good.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.948
Go help the boys blow the safe.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.496
What have you done to him? You-- You--

06:10.997 --> 06:12.331
You--

06:12.540 --> 06:15.084
He's under the influence of cataphrenic.

06:15.293 --> 06:19.547
A drug which reverses
all the normal moral and ethical standards...

06:19.755 --> 06:23.175
...and causes a person to become
the exact opposite of what he was before.

06:23.384 --> 06:27.722
So now he's just as pro-crime
as formerly he was anti?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.603
Exactly.

06:33.811 --> 06:39.275
Now, my next move
is to put Batman in the same condition.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.782
Stick with me, sweetheart.
We're going places together.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.911
As soon as we get enough cash,
we'll lay low across the border.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.454
Forget it.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.456
All this is working capital.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.291
We got a much bigger job to pull.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.628
- You're the boss, Catwoman.
-Yup.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.421
What's wrong?

07:00.630 --> 07:02.423
I don't know. I feel dizzy.

07:02.632 --> 07:04.967
L... Ah...

07:05.134 --> 07:07.553
Probably a negative side effect
from the drug.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.680
It should wear off in a couple hours.

07:09.889 --> 07:13.059
Spade, Marlow, Templar,
take him and get out of here.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.144
Never mind.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.189
Give me.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.828
- Hello?
-Oh, I'm so glad I found you, sir.

07:33.037 --> 07:35.081
Master Robin was just here with--

07:35.289 --> 07:36.832
<i>- With</i> Catwoman.
- Catwoman?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.209
- Catwoman?
-Catwoman?

07:38.417 --> 07:42.546
Yes, sir. They proceeded to rob the wall safe
of the housekeeping money.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.465
Two-hundred thousand dollars.

07:44.674 --> 07:47.051
Worst of all, sir,
Master Robin didn't recognize me.

07:47.218 --> 07:52.431
He's under the influence of some drug
that, uh, makes him, well, sir, quite a bully.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.018
It also causes amnesia and fainting spells.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.853
Mm-hm.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.982
It appears she has the power
to cloud men's minds.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.358
Stay right where you are.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.609
Yeah.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.405
Commissioner...

08:08.030 --> 08:10.157
...it's worse than we thought.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.412
Where's Robin?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.540
Sleeping it off in the other room,
Catwoman.

08:17.748 --> 08:21.877
He seems sort of fuzzy
since we got back from Wayne Manor.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.631
Oh. Well, we just won't take him
on any of our jobs.

08:26.215 --> 08:31.846
But as long as he's on our side, even in spirit,
that'll keep Batman at a safe distance.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.058
What are you doing, Pussycat?

08:36.267 --> 08:38.727
I bought one of those
background music records.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.645
Music?

08:40.855 --> 08:43.232
I just wanna hear how I sound.

08:43.441 --> 08:45.651
Marlow and Spade and Templar...

08:45.860 --> 08:49.530
...they've generously consented
to be my test audience.

08:49.739 --> 08:51.449
I told you to forget about music.

08:51.657 --> 08:55.953
Now, either you're gonna be a singer,
or you're gonna be an arch-criminal.

08:56.162 --> 08:58.664
- You can't be both.
-Do I have a choice?

08:59.248 --> 09:01.167
No. You're too short.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.461
Anyway, you had your choice
and you took it...

09:03.669 --> 09:07.298
...when I picked you out of that, uh,
Milk Shake A Go-Go on the Sunset Strip.

09:07.506 --> 09:11.844
Ah, the Milk Shake A Go-Go. Sunset Strip.

09:12.053 --> 09:14.305
All right, sing.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.682
But I won't listen.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.810
Forget your past flings.

09:52.802 --> 09:56.639
Along the sand

09:56.806 --> 10:00.726
<i>Let's walk the shores together now</i>

10:00.893 --> 10:05.064
<i>Yes, hand in hand</i>

10:05.231 --> 10:08.567
<i>It's gonna be fair weather now</i>

10:08.734 --> 10:10.611
<i>When the stars come out</i>

10:10.778 --> 10:15.783
<i>Stop to count them in the sky</i>

10:16.826 --> 10:22.873
<i>Warm California nights</i>

10:23.040 --> 10:26.752
<i>With the breeze blowing in</i>

10:26.919 --> 10:30.256
<i>Time for love to begin</i>

10:30.422 --> 10:34.593
<i>I would miss</i>

10:34.760 --> 10:38.597
<i>California nights</i>

10:38.764 --> 10:42.518
<i>If I went on my way</i>

10:42.685 --> 10:46.939
<i>Thinking now that I'll stay</i>

10:50.776 --> 10:53.863
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

10:54.822 --> 10:57.908
<i>Love you, baby</i>

10:58.534 --> 11:03.247
<i>Mm, baby</i>

11:03.414 --> 11:09.503
<i>Love California nights</i>

11:09.670 --> 11:13.465
<i>Always close as a kiss</i>

11:13.632 --> 11:16.969
<i>Nothing's sweeter than this</i>

11:17.136 --> 11:21.140
<i>And we'll spend</i>

11:21.307 --> 11:25.144
<i>California nights</i>

11:32.401 --> 11:33.569
Enough.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.946
No more. Quiet.

11:36.614 --> 11:40.367
Nobody gets more applause
than Catwoman.

11:41.785 --> 11:45.122
Ahem. That was very nice.

11:45.331 --> 11:48.584
- Have you gotten it out of your system?
-For the time being.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.295
All right, we can concentrate
on the problems at hand.

11:51.503 --> 11:55.216
- Which are?
-We need another $800,000.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.508
And Batman.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.385
In that order.

11:58.594 --> 11:59.845
Batman?

12:00.054 --> 12:04.058
I thought you said we'd be in the clear
with Batman as long as we have Robin.

12:04.683 --> 12:08.562
Well, I want more.
I want Batman in my corner.

12:08.771 --> 12:12.775
Once we get him on our side,
there'll be no end to our criminal activities.

12:12.983 --> 12:16.362
That's a tall order, Catwoman.
About 6-foot-2.

12:18.072 --> 12:20.491
Well, I can do it.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.827
The first item on the agenda
is a phone call to the commissioner.

12:24.036 --> 12:27.206
Pussycat, bring me the telephone.

12:35.839 --> 12:36.882
Oh.

12:37.049 --> 12:40.135
- Put her on my private line, please.
- Yes, sir.

12:41.387 --> 12:42.846
What do you want, Catwoman?

12:43.180 --> 12:48.560
Plug me into the Batphone,
if you know what's good for you.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.605
Now, look here,
what do you think this is anyway?

12:51.814 --> 12:53.857
Stop fumfering and be quick about it.

13:05.619 --> 13:09.248
- Yes, commissioner?
-I have a call for you, Batman.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.960
<i>Hello, Batman. How are you feeling?</i>

13:13.168 --> 13:17.506
I know you didn't call to ask about my health,
Catwoman. What have you done to Robin?

13:17.673 --> 13:21.260
He's safe, as long as you do as I say.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.762
<i>- Go on.
- I plan to commit...</i>

13:23.929 --> 13:25.639
<i>...a series of robberies.</i>

13:25.806 --> 13:26.974
<i>Why are you telling me?</i>

13:27.141 --> 13:29.518
Because if you or the police
do anything to stop me...

13:29.685 --> 13:32.604
...I'll have Robin killed instantly.

13:34.023 --> 13:35.316
Catwoman...

13:35.524 --> 13:42.406
...I find you to be odious, abhorrent
and insegrevious.

13:42.614 --> 13:46.618
Dealing with you has expanded my vocabulary,
increased my word power, uh...

13:46.827 --> 13:47.870
...a whole lot.

13:48.037 --> 13:50.039
Now, if we could meet on neutral ground...

13:50.205 --> 13:52.499
...I'm sure we could come
to a complete agreement.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.293
Don't do it, Batman. It's a trap.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.963
Are you listening, Commissioner Gordon?
Tut-tut-tut.

13:58.130 --> 14:02.843
Don't you know that that's illegal?
Ha-ha-ha.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.720
No deal, Catwoman.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.182
All right.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.100
It's curtains for Robin.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.685
La-di-da-di-da-la-la.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.650
Dreadfully sorry, Batman,
but I could scarcely contain myself.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.528
It's all right, commissioner. I understand.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.697
I must handle this in my own way.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.700
Don't be shocked
by anything that happens...

14:26.909 --> 14:31.455
...and under no circumstances
make any attempt to capture her.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.583
It may mean Robin's life.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.172
Why are we only stealing cash?

14:40.381 --> 14:44.218
Because, my dear Pussycat,
I must raise $1 million in small bills...

14:44.385 --> 14:46.303
...to purchase plans
of the Gotham City Mint.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.013
The mint?

14:48.222 --> 14:51.892
Wow. You always did think big, Catwoman.

14:52.101 --> 14:53.519
Why not? Hm.

14:53.727 --> 14:58.482
I'd get the same prison term
for knocking over a hot-dog stand.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.401
When you're a 12-time loser...

15:00.609 --> 15:03.487
...it doesn't make much difference
what you steal.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.489
Go see if Robin's ready to move.

15:07.950 --> 15:08.992
How much?

15:09.159 --> 15:10.911
- Only a hundred thou, Catwoman.
-Oh.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.622
Add it to the <i>2</i> we got
from stately Wayne Manor...

15:13.789 --> 15:16.959
...and we're still 700 thou short of our goal.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.086
Well...

15:19.461 --> 15:23.757
...there are a couple of people around town
who are known to keep large sums of money.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.510
We'll have to hit them for that.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.179
Robin is dead to the world.

15:29.388 --> 15:33.308
I had to put a mirror to his mouth
to see if he was still breathing.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.811
Ah, probably gave him an overdose.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.480
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, tabbies.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.733
Pussycat, guard the money.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.619
<i>NARRATOR".
And in the decrepit loft apartment...</i>

15:52.786 --> 15:57.749
<i>...of the world's richest and cheapest inventor,
Pat Pending...</i>

15:58.083 --> 16:01.503
Rudy, I've got it. Ha-ha!

16:01.670 --> 16:04.798
I perfected the formula
for our universal solvent.

16:05.591 --> 16:08.635
Oh, that's real good, Mr. Pending.

16:08.844 --> 16:12.222
- But what are you going to keep it in?
-What?

16:12.639 --> 16:18.520
If it's really a universal solvent,
it'll go right through every container.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.522
By George, you're right.

16:20.731 --> 16:22.316
- Yes.
-I never thought of that.

16:22.524 --> 16:26.904
And you can give up any thoughts
about your perpetual-motion machine.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.823
Never. It'll be a boon to humanity.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.241
No, it won't.

16:31.450 --> 16:34.119
It'll put millions of people out of work.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.956
What happens when parts don't need
to be replaced anymore?

16:38.165 --> 16:41.627
Think of the machinists
and lathe operators...

16:41.835 --> 16:46.590
...and folks like that
who'd be on the breadline.

16:47.716 --> 16:52.387
Rudy, besides being a good valet,
you're a genius.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.097
Thanks, Mr. Pending.

16:54.306 --> 16:58.644
Well, at least I still have one thing.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.687
My money-

17:04.107 --> 17:05.358
I don't know, Mr. Pending.

17:05.567 --> 17:09.238
Sometimes I think your money
would be safer in a bank.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.656
Sometimes, Rudy, you're too negative.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.492
You heard the news on the radio.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.703
Was that money in the bank
safe from Catwoman, huh?

17:18.997 --> 17:23.752
Here on the 10th floor of this old warehouse,
we've got the best bank of all...

17:23.961 --> 17:26.255
...my mattress.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.591
Get them.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.562
Any stocks or bonds missing?

17:41.770 --> 17:43.105
No, no.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.774
I woke up
when they were gathering the money.

17:45.983 --> 17:49.861
Catwoman specifically indicated cash.
My cash.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.365
Said her contact demanded
small bills only.

17:53.699 --> 17:56.410
Did she have anything else to say
about her contact?

17:56.577 --> 17:59.746
Mentioned something about
a prince getting weighed.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.290
Whatever that means.

18:01.498 --> 18:04.543
A prince getting weighed. Huh.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.545
Do you know what? I think I've got it.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.214
Tomorrow morning,
Prince Ibn Kereb of Gedallia...

18:09.423 --> 18:12.467
...has his annual weighing-in ceremony
in his embassy ballroom.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.095
- It was in this morning's paper.
-Of course.

18:15.304 --> 18:19.516
They weigh the prince on one side of a scale
and they pour paper money on the other side.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.226
- Yes.
-I read it too.

18:21.560 --> 18:25.689
And when the weight of the money
equals the prince's weight...

18:25.897 --> 18:28.734
...they turn it all over
to the orphans of the country.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.111
Fantastic.

18:31.445 --> 18:32.946
Let's go. We must notify Batman.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.866
- You bet, commissioner. To the elevator.
- Yes.

18:38.452 --> 18:43.749
<i>NARRATOR". And the next morning,
Prince Ibn Kereb is getting weighed.</i>

18:52.049 --> 18:53.342
This is a surprise attack.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.220
Now, you all have your instructions.
Synchronize watches.

18:57.429 --> 19:00.724
- None of us have watches.
<i>-Ah--</i>

19:01.391 --> 19:04.019
Just get the money and run.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.898
- How are you feeling, Robin?
-Hm.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.150
Mm, perfect.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.443
You're learning.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.240
Get the loot, Robin. Everyone else, freeze.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.451
Don't do it, Robin.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.329
She's got you under her spell, Robin.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.082
Who's the character
in the ridiculous costume?

19:25.248 --> 19:27.250
Ha-ha! That's Batman.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.628
Don't you recognize me, Robin?

19:32.255 --> 19:34.549
What a dastardly development this is.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.176
Stay out of this, men.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.470
I'd rather do it myself.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.264
Oh, my money! My money!

19:41.431 --> 19:42.474
Hey, stop them!

19:44.184 --> 19:45.769
Stop them! Oh, the money.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.524
- My money! That is my money!
-Shut up.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.943
- Allah! Oh, my money.
Ha-ha.

20:08.792 --> 20:12.337
Now that I have dispensed with your men,
Catwoman...

20:12.504 --> 20:13.797
...your turn has come.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.924
Not yet, Batman.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.176
- Robin?
-Yeah.

20:18.343 --> 20:22.347
Ha. Slay the blue dragon.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.224
Groovy.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.184
Oh, no.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.603
Heh. Oh, yes.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.587
Come on, cats.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.927
Everyone into my Catillac.

21:39.341 --> 21:45.388
<i>NARRATOR". Across the bridge
in New Guernsey lies the Catlair West.</i>

21:45.764 --> 21:50.018
Ah, Batman's on my trail.
I can feel it in my whiskers.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.645
Well, we'll have to get ready.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.271
Wake up.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.856
Uh...

21:55.524 --> 21:58.068
Get me the electric cattle prods.

21:58.276 --> 22:00.821
Yeah. And turn them up full volume.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.616
Oh, boy, is he in for a shock.

22:17.003 --> 22:22.300
Commissioner Gordon,
I seem to have found a second Catlair.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.470
This could be a trap,
but I'll have to chance it.

22:25.637 --> 22:27.973
Robin's life is at stake.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.433
Of course I'll call you.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.375
Holy nick of time.
Am I glad you showed up.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.003
Good boy, Robin.
You've been playing possum.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.797
And all the time
I thought you'd become a turncape.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.048
Oh.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.050
Oh.

23:05.510 --> 23:09.973
Ha-ha-ha. Would I do that to you,
huh, Batman baby?

23:30.201 --> 23:31.369
Great Scott. I--

23:31.745 --> 23:33.580
Batman.

23:33.788 --> 23:36.166
If you agree to help me, I'll let you up.

23:36.374 --> 23:37.918
If not...

23:38.084 --> 23:40.879
...Robin will cut the rope,
the steel bar will snap...

23:41.087 --> 23:43.506
...and you'll be divided into equal parts.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.259
In other words, heh...

23:46.426 --> 23:48.303
...you'll be beside yourself.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.555
I'll never be your partner, Catwoman.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.599
Oh.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.684
Ho-hum.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.938
Boy Wonder, start cutting.
