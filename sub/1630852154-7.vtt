- Uh, we'll see how much you're
willing to let it go for.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.734

- And then, if you open it up.

06:20.867 --> 06:22.500

06:24.633 --> 06:27.033
I've been collecting
for about 31 years

06:27.166 --> 06:29.734
and that particular camera
was a very rare find,

06:29.867 --> 06:32.066
simply because it was still
fully functional.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.867
- What do you think?
- Oh, what do you think?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.233
$45 bucks?
Ted: 45 bucks,

06:37.367 --> 06:39.333
I think it's worth
more than that.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.700

is very cool.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.400

for that thing,

06:47.266 --> 06:48.567
just to stick in a corner.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.033
- Okay, so let's compromise
here.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.867

06:52.000 --> 06:54.400
- $80? $85 bucks,
how about $85 bucks,

06:54.533 --> 06:56.600
because that's very cool.
- We'll go halfway,

06:56.734 --> 06:58.367
so okay, $85.
- $85, alright, deal.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.400
- The whole kit, with the bag.
Oh no, now you're talking like-

07:00.533 --> 07:02.133
Because you said this
doesn't come with it.

07:02.266 --> 07:03.967

Oh, the inside doesn't.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.967

07:06.100 --> 07:08.000
- doesn't come with it. Right?

07:08.133 --> 07:09.934

07:10.066 --> 07:13.433

I don't know, so,

I've bargained.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.200

Excellent.

07:49.533 --> 07:51.266
I've seen a few pieces
that have intrigued me,

07:51.400 --> 07:53.333
and I'm just excited to get
my hands on some things.

07:53.467 --> 07:55.400
- Like back in the 70s,
they sold these things

07:55.533 --> 07:58.200
as a portable bar, right?
It would hold cups and glasses,

07:58.333 --> 08:00.166
you put a couple bottles
in here.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.533
They see you walking around
with this,

08:01.667 --> 08:03.367
you're like the coolest dude
in the, in the party.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.166

- Yeah.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.667
You wanna grab the whole thing?
Grab it all,

08:06.800 --> 08:08.400

$30 bucks, you like it?

08:08.533 --> 08:11.533

could we do $20?

08:11.667 --> 08:13.800
- 20? $25, $25.
- $25 bucks.

08:13.934 --> 08:15.400
- Yeah?
- $25 bucks. Sounds good.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.633

Anything else?

08:17.767 --> 08:19.734

things that,

08:19.867 --> 08:21.800

over here.

Ted: Oh, you've got a pile
of stuff there.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.033
- I'll start with the, with
the picture first actually.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.033
- We pulled that picture out
of Petrolia.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.133
It shows a member of
the Order of Odd Fellows

08:30.266 --> 08:31.867
tending to a sick child.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.734
- Just jumped right out at me.
- Yeah, it's cool.

08:33.867 --> 08:35.400
- It's, it's like heart
wrenching, right?

08:35.533 --> 08:37.266
Like I've got a daughter,
so it felt right away

08:37.400 --> 08:38.600
like I have an emotional
connection with it.

08:38.734 --> 08:41.400
- Alright, okay. So let me,
this is the early 1900s.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.800
- An old piece of artwork

08:43.934 --> 08:45.633
grabbed my attention right
away.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.967
It was a very emotional piece,
depicting a father

08:48.100 --> 08:50.700
with a sick child
and a doctor at the bed.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.800
- I, I'd do $150 bucks
on that.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.000
It's not something you're
going to see all the time.

08:57.133 --> 08:58.367
- I'm thinking more $100.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.734
- I'd, $140.

09:01.867 --> 09:04.100
$140, you like these toys too?

09:04.233 --> 09:07.333
- I, I picked these up because
where I'm from in Argentina,

09:07.467 --> 09:10.066
my dad came from a very poor
family.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.567
He would have, he would have
absolutely killed to have...

09:12.700 --> 09:15.133
- Oh, to have a toy like that.
- to have a toy like this.

09:15.266 --> 09:17.200
- And I have a, a transport
business.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.100

these ones.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.600
- Yes.
- Yeah. They're still steel.

09:21.734 --> 09:23.533
So like $160 bucks for all it.

09:23.667 --> 09:27.233
And what were we at on that?
$25. So $185 for everything.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.133

looked at it yet

fix it. If we get it going,

restore this whole cabinet,

15:51.467 --> 15:53.200
So what are you guys after?

15:53.333 --> 15:55.333
Trudy: Uh, I collect things
to put on the ceiling

15:55.467 --> 15:57.333
in the garage.
- On the ceiling. Lights?

15:57.467 --> 15:59.433
Trudy: Yeah, we've got water
skis up there,

15:59.567 --> 16:01.266
we've got downhill skills.
- Planes.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.166
- planes. Oh, anything. Yes.
Brandon: How about those?

16:04.300 --> 16:06.233
Trudy: Oh, I love them.

16:06.367 --> 16:08.166
- I learned not to call things
junk.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.467
Everything is somebody
else's treasure.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.033
Ted: There's stuff up
in the top there.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.200
Brandon: Now when I look at
things, I'm seeing the value

16:15.333 --> 16:17.066
in them and I'm seeing the
potential that they can have.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.767
And if it wasn't for Ted, I
would have never learned that.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.567
Trudy: What would you be asking
for something like this?

16:21.700 --> 16:24.600
- $80 bucks.
- Oh. Okay.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.600
- It's a nice set of shoes.
Good shape.

16:26.734 --> 16:29.266
Perfect wall hanger.
- I see what you're saying,

16:29.400 --> 16:31.033
but what if there's something
else on the table

16:31.166 --> 16:33.200
I might like and we can bundle
up something?

16:33.333 --> 16:35.033
- So $80 bucks and whatever
else you like.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.533
- Or whichever.
- Or two for $80.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.800
- Like, what else do you want?
- Or two for $80, two for $80.

16:39.934 --> 16:42.400
- Um, well, I don't know, let's
see. We just walked in, so...

16:42.533 --> 16:45.700
I'd like these actually. I like
the silver and the brass here.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.767
- Those are electroplate
silver, right?

16:47.900 --> 16:49.233
- Yeah.

16:49.367 --> 16:52.967
- You can have those for $15
each. That's a good deal.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.166
Brandon: What are you looking
at down here?

16:55.300 --> 16:58.166
- I want this. I want this.
- The anchor?

16:58.300 --> 17:01.133
You can have it.
But you've got to buy it.

17:01.266 --> 17:03.800
- What's the price? Of course,
price on everything.

17:03.934 --> 17:05.500
- We found that in Golden Lake
actually.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.800
$10 bucks, you can have it.

17:10.066 --> 17:11.433
- Could you do $5?

17:11.567 --> 17:13.867
- We'll do $5. I could see how
much you really want that.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.633
- This I'm going to say $25
bucks. This is $20 bucks.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.834
That, that's a nice,
that's a nice box, $25.

17:18.967 --> 17:20.166
- Okay. It is,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.500
I really like how the lettering
is still clear.

17:22.633 --> 17:25.767
- How about $100,
$130 bucks for the package?

17:27.967 --> 17:29.767
- Um...
- So you're like,

17:29.900 --> 17:31.133
you're getting a good deal.

17:31.266 --> 17:32.900
You're getting a lot of stuff
here.

17:33.033 --> 17:36.266
- Hmm. I've still got to buy
lunch today. How about $115?

17:36.400 --> 17:38.600
For everything.
We can pay cash.

17:38.734 --> 17:40.600
- How, how about $120?

17:42.900 --> 17:46.100
$120 bucks, that's a good deal.
- You know what, Ted?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.233
You've got yourself a deal.
- Deal? Deal. Excellent.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.233
- Thank you.
- Anything else?

17:50.367 --> 17:52.066
- No, I think that'll be all
today.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.867
- Mom, we've got another one.
- Hold on, hold on.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.700
- You did? What did you get?

17:55.834 --> 17:57.600
- I want this.
- $100 bucks.

17:57.734 --> 18:00.166
- Oh, that is so you.
- Ninety-nine.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.500
- How much, how much? $99?
Sold.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.667
- .99 cents.
- Sold.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.500
Ted: Brandon's come a long way
this year.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.867
He's a lot more comfortable
dealing with customers.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.567
If he wants a future in this
business, he's got it.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.200
How much is that?
- Sold, $5 bucks.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.233
- Alright. So that's a good
deal. $125 for everything,

18:16.367 --> 18:18.100
right?
- $125 I think is a great deal.

18:18.233 --> 18:20.767
- Sounds good.
- Grab the shoes, let's go
write it up.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.000
- Alright, let's go.
- Sweet.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.367
- Thank you.
- Easy peasy, eh?

18:23.500 --> 18:25.033
- Oh my God, that's so awesome.
- I like them.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.433
But there's more stuff
on the way out as well.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.100
You don't have to stop.
- Of course.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.000
- I see that.
- You can keep going.

18:31.133 --> 18:32.667
This is fun. We've been
on the road all year

18:32.800 --> 18:34.967
and it's great to be back
in the yard selling,

18:35.100 --> 18:36.800
talking to people. I love it.

18:37.834 --> 18:40.000
Narrator: One of Ted's most
unique buyers is up next

18:40.133 --> 18:42.233
for his turn at the semi-annual
sale.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.300
Ted: Salvage doesn't stop,
you notice that?

18:44.433 --> 18:46.100
- It doesn't.
- It doesn't stop.

18:46.233 --> 18:47.834
- Hey.
This one?

18:47.967 --> 18:49.567
- Yeah, that's the one.
Noel's on his way.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.767
- Oh, Noel. Yeah.
- Oh, Noel's buying this?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.400
Ted: Booking these buyers
individually

18:53.533 --> 18:56.166
has turned out great
and no sale would be complete

18:56.300 --> 18:58.633
without a visit from my buddy,
Noel.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.367
This sign is super cool.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.767
We found it in the attic
of an old arena in Timmins.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.834
Why the hell would you leave
this?

19:04.967 --> 19:06.400
It's in great condition,

19:06.533 --> 19:08.834
excellent piece of local
history. Very collectable.

19:08.967 --> 19:10.633
Justin: Every day he comes,
he has a different vehicle.

19:10.767 --> 19:12.033
- Oh, I know.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.700
- So I wonder if it's going to
be the Riviera.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.233
- No idea what he's driving
today.

19:15.367 --> 19:16.967
- What?
- What is this?

19:17.100 --> 19:18.834
- Oh, here he is, look at this.
What?

19:18.967 --> 19:20.400
(Honks)

19:20.533 --> 19:23.233
- It's like boat horns on
there. Beautiful rig, Noel.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.567
- My name is Noel and I come
here quite often

19:25.700 --> 19:28.033
to look for artifacts
and treasures

19:28.166 --> 19:30.100
that I think are worth money
or collectable.

19:30.233 --> 19:31.934
Long time.
Ted: How are you?

19:32.066 --> 19:34.600
- Yeah, not bad, not bad. Now,
this one just got finished up.

19:34.734 --> 19:37.033
The inside needs to be done
but it's, it's coming along.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.066
- Different alright.
Ted: Just like you, brother.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.033
- Yeah. Thank you very much.
- That's the sign you wanted?

19:41.166 --> 19:42.834
- Yes, this is the one I called
you about.

19:42.967 --> 19:45.433
Ted: Noel has a buddy,
believe it or not,

19:45.567 --> 19:47.767
his mother lives up there.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.734
I've got him right
where I want him.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.500
- I'm gonna get it for him,
to give to her.

19:51.633 --> 19:55.367
- For a $1,000 bucks?
- Again, $1,000 bucks!

19:55.500 --> 19:57.467
Everything's a thousand bucks.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.200
- That's the sign you want?

20:04.333 --> 20:06.433
- Yes, this is the one
I called you about.

20:06.567 --> 20:09.567
- For a $1,000 bucks?
- Again, $1,000 bucks!

20:09.700 --> 20:11.233
- No, it's not a $1,000 bucks.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.767
- Everything's a $1,000 bucks.
- We're asking $400 bucks.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.533
It's pretty unique. Yeah.
- $400?

20:15.667 --> 20:17.800
Well, you know what? I kind
of owe my friend a favour,

20:17.934 --> 20:19.300
he's helped me out.
- It's for his mother though.

20:19.433 --> 20:21.300
- Yeah, I don't mind.
- Yeah, it's for his mother.

20:21.433 --> 20:23.667
- Okay, $350?
- $350, deal.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.533
- Okay, $350. Alright.
- Deal.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.033
- Deal, $350, for real.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.900
- This we'll do, it's for him,
yeah, for real.

20:29.033 --> 20:30.367
- Alright, okay.
- Alright, now,

20:30.500 --> 20:32.367
you think these two tough guys
can put it in here for me?

20:32.500 --> 20:33.900
My back's a little sore today.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.533
It was another great visit
to the yard

20:35.667 --> 20:37.233
and always a pleasure engaging
with Ted.

20:37.367 --> 20:38.900
- Let's go write it up.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.700
- And I'm sure he'll call me
if he comes across

20:40.834 --> 20:42.800
any interesting stuff,
artifacts, treasures,

20:42.934 --> 20:44.800
collectibles,
whatever it may be.

20:44.934 --> 20:47.667
♪♪

20:47.800 --> 20:50.367
Narrator: Ted's next
appointment for the sale
has arrived

20:50.500 --> 20:53.233
and he's already found some
salvage to haggle over.

20:53.367 --> 20:54.967
- I'm Howard.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.433
I came in here to buy some
stuff for my cottage.

20:57.567 --> 21:00.300
I like coming into places
like this, they're fun.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.166
Get a little bit of history.

21:02.300 --> 21:03.867
- How are you doing?
- Good, thanks.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.633
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.400
- You like that, eh?
- Yeah, it's very pretty.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.633
Ted: Here we go.
Oh, I like this. Pepsi.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.300
Coke is number one desirable,
Pepsi's right behind it.

21:12.433 --> 21:14.233
And Pepsi stuff's a little
rarer

21:14.367 --> 21:16.200
because there is way more Coke
made.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.600
- You like it for $100 bucks?
- No.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.967
- Well, how much do you
like it?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.300
- $75?
- I'd do $75.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.400
- You can do $75?
- You like all this stuff,

21:26.533 --> 21:28.166
is that your pile?
- That's my pile.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.633
Ted: Some old oil cans, a honey
pot and a cool old light.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.433
- Do $100 for everything?

21:32.567 --> 21:35.867
- No. Let's say $125.
$125 is good.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.500
- I come to a place like this,
so I can bargain a little bit.

21:38.633 --> 21:41.166
- We are bargaining right now.
- Okay, so.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.266
- I was going to say $75 bucks
for all that,

21:43.400 --> 21:45.533
plus $75 for this would be
a buck 50, but...

21:45.667 --> 21:47.433
- I'm glad that's what you were
going to say.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.867
- But let's do $120.
- $105.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.166
- $120.
- Cut it in the middle, $110.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.834
- No, $115.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.166
- Okay.
- Okay. $115.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.867
- Okay.
- Deal.

22:00.066 --> 22:01.367
I'll get Brandon to box that
all up.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.233
- Okay, thank you.
- Let's go write it up.

22:03.367 --> 22:04.667
Alright? Come on.
- Okay, cool.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.800
- I think I got a good deal.
Ted is a real good guy

22:06.934 --> 22:08.600
to deal with. It was fun,
let's put it that way,

22:08.734 --> 22:10.333
I like the bickering part.
We'll be back.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.700
- Why wouldn't you?
There's great deals here.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.700
Narrator: It's time for Ted's
next buyer.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.266
- Hey man, take a look around.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.266
- Looks like you've got lots
of nice stuff here.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.033
- Tons of stuff.
What are you looking for,

22:21.166 --> 22:23.266
what are you interested in?
- Whatever peaks my interest,
you know.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.567
My name is Devon and I'm a
lover of all things vintage.

22:25.700 --> 22:27.600
I like to know the story behind
things and I don't really know

22:27.734 --> 22:30.100
what I'm looking for but
I'll know it when I see it.

22:30.233 --> 22:32.667
Now that I could tell you
is pretty interesting.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.633
Where'd it come from?
- We found this in Golden Lake.

22:34.767 --> 22:37.033
Pulled it out of a tavern.
Anything else catch your eye?

22:37.166 --> 22:38.667
We'll leave this here for now.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.133
- Uh, the F150 Ranger badge
looks pretty neat.

22:41.266 --> 22:43.100
The F150 Ranger used to be
a trim package,

22:43.233 --> 22:45.233
but now it's its own truck.
Huh.

22:45.367 --> 22:47.266
- Do you have something like
that you can use it for?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.133
- I've got an old Camaro.
- What do you think?

22:49.266 --> 22:50.900
- Yeah, don't mind if I do.
- Add it maybe?

22:51.033 --> 22:53.333
- Sure.
- I'll add it to the pile
for you.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.700
(Line rings)
- Hey Ted,

22:57.834 --> 23:00.533
come help me out in
the white barn. Okay, bye.

23:02.166 --> 23:03.633
Did you find anything you like?

23:03.767 --> 23:05.433
- So what's the number you've
got on this thing?

23:05.567 --> 23:08.066
- Honestly, dude, I have no
idea. I gave Ted a call,

23:08.200 --> 23:10.000
he'll be here in a couple
minutes. He knows everything

23:10.133 --> 23:11.500
about it. Oh, he's right here.
- Hey buddy.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.333
- Oh. Hi Ted.
- How are you doing, I'm Ted.

23:13.467 --> 23:14.767
- Nice to meet you.
My name's Devon.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.333
- Do you like that?
That's cool, eh?

23:16.467 --> 23:17.567
- Yeah, tell me a bit about it.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.433
- That's late 70s Panasonic,
super retro.

23:19.567 --> 23:22.567
When I was a kid, like a
teenager. This was a hot piece.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.533
So these right now
are selling regularly $300

23:26.667 --> 23:28.867
to $800 bucks.
- It's a little beat up.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.567
- You're only missing the knob
here

23:30.700 --> 23:32.433
and it needs a good cleaning,
that's it.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.200

he's got a whole bunch of stuff
over here that he likes.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.300
- Oh yeah?
- How about we bring it over,

23:39.433 --> 23:40.700
we do like a bundle thing?
- Yeah.

23:40.834 --> 23:42.567
- Oh, you've got all this?
- Yeah, so he was interested

23:42.700 --> 23:44.333
in a, in a whole bunch
of stuff here.

23:44.467 --> 23:46.333
- So you've got a 70s eye, eh?
- Yeah, a little bit.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.033
- Because that, that's 70s too.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.300
These are selling for $200
bucks but I'll do $100,

23:50.433 --> 23:54.033

This, you like that?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.333

I'm a big Ford truck guy,

23:56.467 --> 23:58.000
so I have an old ranger.
- The smaller one.

23:58.133 --> 23:59.433
- That's right, yeah,
the little small pickup.

23:59.567 --> 24:01.400

24:01.533 --> 24:03.734
Remember that old truck
in Sturgeon Falls?

24:03.867 --> 24:06.166
It was right in the way when
Justin had to make a road.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.633
- Oh, before we started breaking
all of the cars on the side.

24:08.767 --> 24:10.400
- Yeah, so he pushed the thing
out of the way.

24:10.533 --> 24:11.934

I remember.

24:12.066 --> 24:13.500
- Pulled that off of there.
- Yeah.

24:13.633 --> 24:15.400
- So that I would throw in
with this.

24:15.533 --> 24:16.934

24:17.066 --> 24:18.500
- That's what I'm really
curious about.

24:18.633 --> 24:20.500
- That's cool. If I popped that
right off and cleaned this up,

24:20.633 --> 24:22.633
I'm going to get over $100
bucks for this clock.

24:22.767 --> 24:25.166

26:27.033 --> 26:29.233
Narrator: This Russell Brothers
winch boat

26:29.367 --> 26:31.834
was built for a Northern
sawmill in 1946.

26:31.967 --> 26:33.700
They were designed
to be powerful

26:33.834 --> 26:35.600
and run by a single operator.

26:35.734 --> 26:37.500
They were often used
in remote locations,

26:37.633 --> 26:40.033
so they had to be reliable
and easy to fix.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.433
This model was equipped with
a two cylinder gasoline engine

26:42.567 --> 26:44.433
that was started manually.

26:44.567 --> 26:46.633
The team salvaged the boat
from the same northern river

31:39.033 --> 31:41.300
- Okay, so we're at $750
right now?

31:41.433 --> 31:43.066
- Yeah, we're at $750,
I've got $400 on that.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.967
So $1,150.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.400
- How about $1,000,
I like round numbers.

31:47.533 --> 31:50.367
- I like round numbers too,
how about $1,100?

31:50.500 --> 31:52.500
- I think I can meet you there.
- Yeah? $1,100?

31:52.633 --> 31:54.266
- Yeah.
- Deal. Sold.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.500
Let's go write it up
in the caboose there

31:56.633 --> 31:59.633
and I'll get Brandon and Maya to
get this all together for you.

31:59.767 --> 32:01.467
Dexter: Sounds good,
sounds good.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.233
- They're going to have to find
eight chairs that match.

32:03.367 --> 32:04.934
- I got a screaming deal.

32:05.066 --> 32:07.800
I actually got what the wife
wanted too, dining room chairs.

32:07.934 --> 32:10.900
So, I'll get a pass.
Lots of cool stuff, man.

32:11.033 --> 32:12.433
Lots of cool stuff.
- Lots of stuff.

32:12.567 --> 32:14.367
We've had an amazing year
of salvage.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.367
We have saved so many objects
with great stories behind them

32:17.500 --> 32:19.800
and we found a lot of them
great homes.

32:19.934 --> 32:21.900
The team came together
to lighten the load,

32:22.033 --> 32:23.367
but we've been on the road
a lot

32:23.500 --> 32:25.467
and I am definitely feeling it.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.333
It might be time for a little
break after this sale.

32:28.467 --> 32:30.667
Narrator: Ted's appointments
are stacked up back to back.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.834
Next up, a collector interested
in the hockey cards

32:32.967 --> 32:35.300
the guys found in an old
rooming house.

32:35.433 --> 32:37.033
- How are you doing, Jamie?
- I'm great.

32:37.166 --> 32:38.767
- You wanna look at the hockey
cards, right?

32:38.900 --> 32:40.500
- Absolutely, that's
what I'm here for.

32:40.633 --> 32:42.166
- Let's take a look
in the caboose here.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.166
- I'm Jamie. I'm a reseller.
I noticed online that they're,

32:44.300 --> 32:46.667
they may have some hockey cards
here for sale, so I stopped by

32:46.800 --> 32:48.500
and looks like I'm going
to make a deal today.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.667
Wow, this is, this is it here.
- That's cool, eh?

32:50.800 --> 32:52.033
- Unbelievable.

32:52.166 --> 32:54.133
Brandon: NHL Players Album,
1966.

32:54.266 --> 32:56.433
Ted: We pulled those out of
a rundown converted movie
theatre.

32:56.567 --> 32:59.333
These are from the 1960s.
You could only get these cards

32:59.467 --> 33:02.400
if you drank a lot of coke
and saved the bottle caps.

33:02.533 --> 33:04.533
Oh, that's beauty, man.
Pretty cool, eh?

33:04.667 --> 33:06.500
I think you're going to buy it.

33:06.633 --> 33:08.300
I can tell by your reaction
right away.

33:08.433 --> 33:10.734
- It's, you know what? You don't
find stuff like this very often.

33:10.867 --> 33:12.967
- No. The cards themselves
are in great shape.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.767
- Let's look at some
of the cards.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.400
Trying to open these very
delicately

33:16.533 --> 33:18.000
because I don't want to wreck
the cards.

33:18.133 --> 33:19.333
There's Gordie Howe
right there.

33:19.467 --> 33:21.066
Unbelievable. The fact that
this is in a condition

33:21.200 --> 33:23.300
like this is,
that's hard to find.

33:23.433 --> 33:25.633
The cards look mint.
I'm definitely interested.

33:25.767 --> 33:27.200
So what are we talking here?

33:27.333 --> 33:29.066
- Yeah. I'm thinking $300
bucks.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.000
- Hmm.
- $300 bucks,

33:31.133 --> 33:32.867
that's a good price for that.
Complete set.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.200
- Right. Um,

33:34.333 --> 33:36.834
I'm kind of thinking
more like two.

33:36.967 --> 33:38.200
- Two?

33:40.567 --> 33:42.200
That's a bit low.

33:43.767 --> 33:45.567
Tell you what, you've got,
you've got a Superman shirt on.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.433
- I do.
- You into comics?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.100
Are you into comics?
- I like comics, yes.

33:49.233 --> 33:51.100
- Do you? Well, you're in luck.
- Yes, yes.

33:51.233 --> 33:52.834
- Check these out.

33:52.967 --> 33:54.734
And I have some Superman here
too, look at that.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.333
Why don't we do a whole
bundle here?

33:56.467 --> 33:58.867
- Wow, I just noticed this,
you have Wolverine number one.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.767
- That's it, yeah.
- Wow.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.500
This is very condition
sensitive, obviously.

34:02.633 --> 34:04.100
- Right.

34:04.233 --> 34:05.700
- What kind of price
are we looking at here?

34:05.834 --> 34:07.367
- I, I, $600 bucks for
everything. How is that?

34:07.500 --> 34:09.166
- You know, the Superman comics
here,

34:09.300 --> 34:11.567
you're looking at maybe
$10 each. I think the number

34:11.700 --> 34:13.400
is a little high.

I might have to send them in
to get graded.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.467
That's going to cost,
you know, some time.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.767
- How about $500,
$500 I'd be happy.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.100
- Okay, I think we have a deal.
- $500?

34:45.233 --> 34:46.800
- $500, we have a deal.
- Alright, deal.

34:46.934 --> 34:48.700
- Let's write her up.
These are cool.

34:48.834 --> 34:50.233
- They're nice pieces of
history as well.

And I, I'm really, really happy
about this.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.700
I was here just for the hockey
cards,

34:53.834 --> 34:55.667

to see the comics as well.

take care.

I'd buy some furniture
for my restaurant.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.066
I need for outdoor.
- Outdoor furniture.

- I don't have much in the way
of outdoor stuff.

- (Laughs) I cannot do that.

39:23.867 --> 39:25.500
- I knew, I knew you'd say
that, I knew it.

39:25.633 --> 39:29.200
- I cannot and will not.
Ted: Sasha is a great buyer.

39:29.333 --> 39:31.166
She's funny, she makes me
laugh,

39:31.300 --> 39:33.600
I could deal with her all day.
- I do love them.

39:33.734 --> 39:36.100
- How about, for you,
because you're a good customer.

39:36.233 --> 39:39.400
$1,500 for all of them.
- Yeah. I, I'll do $1,500.

39:39.533 --> 39:40.767
That's the number
I had in my mind.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.367
- Deal.
- Thank you.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.967
- Excellent. Now what?
More?

39:44.100 --> 39:45.400
- Okay.
- You're on a roll here.

39:45.533 --> 39:46.834
- So, something I need
for certain

39:46.967 --> 39:48.700
and I see a few right now
that catch my eye, corbels.

39:48.834 --> 39:49.900
Ted: Corbels. Okay, let me grab
a couple.

39:50.033 --> 39:51.533
- Thank you.

39:51.667 --> 39:53.567
- Designers are using corbels
a lot these days.

39:53.700 --> 39:56.166
They are very hot.
You can use them for shelving

39:56.300 --> 39:58.400
or in the kitchen,
they are very cool.

39:58.533 --> 40:00.033
- If the deals are right,
I'll fill the van.

40:00.166 --> 40:02.166
- This size, there's two sizes
here, Sasha.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.867
We've sold quite a few.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.633
The ones that are left have
little issues.

40:05.767 --> 40:08.734
They were $75 bucks a piece.
I'd do that for you for $50.

40:08.867 --> 40:11.700
- So how much bulk deal?
- Six of them. $300 bucks.

40:11.834 --> 40:13.700
$300 bucks for you,
for all of them.

40:13.834 --> 40:15.633
- I will not argue that.
- Yeah?

40:15.767 --> 40:17.400
- Yeah.
- Okay, deal.

40:17.533 --> 40:18.934
- I'll do the $300. Thank you.
- Alright.

40:19.066 --> 40:20.834
What else? Are you shopped out?

40:20.967 --> 40:22.834
- So stained glass is something
that's hard to come by.

40:22.967 --> 40:24.533
So do you have any stained
glass?

40:24.667 --> 40:25.967
- I think I've got some up
here.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.533
- Oh. Oh yeah, I see it.
Ooh, cathedral style too.

40:28.667 --> 40:30.734
- And we've only got a couple
left. Yeah, they're very cool.

40:30.867 --> 40:33.266
- Can you do me the honour?
Hold it up to the light.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.400
- These are from the same
church as that,

40:35.533 --> 40:37.900
the tall windows.
- Okay.

40:38.033 --> 40:40.266
- This was the top, right,
then there was the bottom part.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.500
- Right.
- So that whole storm,

40:42.633 --> 40:44.166
storm window went over this
whole thing.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.533
- Okay.
Justin: Two, three. Oh.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.633
(Window creaks)

40:48.767 --> 40:50.633
- Yeah, baby. Eh?
- That's it.

40:50.767 --> 40:53.166
- I love these. I don't think
I need multiple,

40:53.300 --> 40:54.600
so I will just take one.

40:54.734 --> 40:56.400
So what's your price
just for the one?

40:56.533 --> 40:58.233
- How about $250?
- Yeah, I'll do $250.

40:58.367 --> 41:01.166
- So $1,500, $1,500, $3,000.
- Okay.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.233
- And $300, $3,300.
And then this?

41:03.367 --> 41:05.567
- Yes.
- $250?

41:05.700 --> 41:07.767
- Yes.
- $3,550.

41:07.900 --> 41:11.100
- $3,500 sounds better.
Just the $35.

41:11.233 --> 41:12.934
- Alright, $35 even.
- Okay.

41:13.066 --> 41:14.700
- Let's go write it up.
- Thank you.

41:14.834 --> 41:16.700
- That's a good deal.

41:16.834 --> 41:18.834
- I left today with some
beautiful pieces.

41:18.967 --> 41:20.800
I had a great little chat
with Ted, like usual.

41:20.934 --> 41:22.600
And basically, everything
I came for,

41:22.734 --> 41:24.266
I ended up leaving with.
- Good deal.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.800
- You know what, Ted?
You're awesome.

41:25.934 --> 41:27.633
- Thank you. You are.
- Well, thank you.

41:27.767 --> 41:29.800
Ted: What a fantastic way
to end the day.

41:29.934 --> 41:32.600
We moved a lot of stuff,
met some great new customers

41:32.734 --> 41:35.033
but salvage is all
about the long game.

41:35.166 --> 41:37.000
It takes a huge amount
of effort

41:37.133 --> 41:38.967
to save these pieces of
history,

41:39.100 --> 41:41.967
to understand their value
and to find them a new home.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.967
Because it's hard,
most companies just throw

41:45.100 --> 41:47.700
everything in the garbage
but that's not what we do.

41:47.834 --> 41:49.967
Our team came a long way
this year

41:50.100 --> 41:52.300
and I am pumped
about the future.

41:52.433 --> 41:53.633
Alright, do you wanna go lock
up?

41:53.767 --> 41:55.567
- Yeah, I'll go lock up.
- Excellent.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.300
- Pretty good year, right?
- It was an excellent year.

41:57.433 --> 41:59.300
- You weren't too sure about
Brandon at first.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.166
- This is Justin.
- Justin.
- Brandon.

42:01.300 --> 42:02.767
- So what do you do?
- I'm a labourer.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.767
- I think he'll work out.
- I guarantee he's gonna quit

42:04.900 --> 42:06.567
before we open this place.

42:06.700 --> 42:08.300
I never thought he would grow
like into that position.

42:08.433 --> 42:09.767
- Yeah, like he's into it now.

42:09.900 --> 42:11.633
- Ted, this is filled
with stuff.

42:11.767 --> 42:12.867
Dude, you've got to come
look at this.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.200
- Good find. Good find.
- Sold the jukebox.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.433
- Ron's helping with fixing
stuff.

42:17.567 --> 42:19.767
- Ron's good,
Ron really knows engines.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.433
(Engine roars)
- Yay!

42:24.033 --> 42:25.734
- Yeah, buddy.
- Wooo!

42:25.867 --> 42:28.100
- Proven and tested, eh?
- Maya's helped out the team.

42:28.233 --> 42:29.967
- Maya's doing what we hired
her for.

42:30.100 --> 42:31.967
She's helped us out a lot
in the shop.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.967
- Yeah, it's actually coming
off pretty nicely.

42:34.100 --> 42:36.400
This is at least going to let
this book live on.

42:36.533 --> 42:38.767
- Exactly. The reality is,
we're gonna be on the road

42:38.900 --> 42:41.066
more and more. I can't be
in two places at once.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.633
So we need a bit more here,
organizing, selling.

42:44.767 --> 42:46.967
- Yes.
- We've proved that we can do
it,

42:47.100 --> 42:49.233
let's get bigger. Alright?
- Yeah, man.

42:49.367 --> 42:52.367
- I can't wait to hit the road
and hunt for more treasure

42:52.500 --> 42:54.867
but it's been a long year
and I am beat.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.300
At least a week.
At least a week.

42:57.433 --> 42:59.000
Justin's here,
he'll look after everything.

42:59.133 --> 43:00.834
Ryan. Okay, Ted. Bye.

43:00.967 --> 43:03.266
- I just called Ryan and
I'm going to take some

at the end of the ramp.
Look, over there.

Maya: Where's your truck?

Ted: Truck's for work.
Maya: Yeah, truck's for work,

43:27.400 --> 43:28.800
this is for what,
where are you going?

I'm going to hit the cottage.

43:30.967 --> 43:32.834
- So what, what do we do then?
Ted: You guys got this.

43:32.967 --> 43:34.900
Any problems, give me a call,
alright?

43:35.033 --> 43:36.600
- Does that mean I'm head of
sales now?

43:36.734 --> 43:37.967
(Laughing)
- No.

43:38.100 --> 43:39.700
- No?
- Come on.
- No.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.066

- See you later.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.700
- No.
- Adios.

43:42.834 --> 43:44.900
- See you, man.
I just came back.

some time off, it's Ted.

You don't price anything,

you stay away from
all the windows

and Maya's in charge
of everything.

43:57.300 --> 43:59.633

guys. Go team, woo!

Justin: Let's go do something.
