01:00.977 --> 01:04.538
Maybe you could do better
if you'd crawl on your hands and knees.

01:04.614 --> 01:05.638
Come on!

01:05.715 --> 01:07.080
Some day I'm gonna sock that guy...

01:07.150 --> 01:11.177
- right on the beezer!
- Hey, you, Dink. Lay off of that stuff.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.083
If there's any fighting in this family
your old man's gonna do it.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.423
Alley-oop!

01:22.132 --> 01:24.532
How much further is it to Tijuana?

01:24.601 --> 01:27.798
About three miles.
Go on, or I'll run on top of you.

01:30.073 --> 01:33.600
- Want me to carry you?
- No! What do you think I am, a sissy?

01:33.676 --> 01:37.874
Say, Dink, if them promoters get me
that fight, I'm gonna buy you a horse.

01:38.148 --> 01:39.172
Gee, a real horse?

01:39.249 --> 01:41.649
Certainly. What do you think it is,
a wooden horse?

01:43.052 --> 01:46.453
Hey, what happened to the atch-pay
I sewed on the anny-fay?

01:47.090 --> 01:48.990
Gee, I must have lost it.

01:50.293 --> 01:51.658
Does it ow-shay?

01:51.928 --> 01:55.955
Well, I guess it's your underwear.
It'll give you plenty of air...

01:56.032 --> 01:57.761
through there, anyway.

02:10.913 --> 02:14.372
Gee, I think that's enough for today,
don't you, huh?

02:14.651 --> 02:17.119
You've done swell, Champ.
Ain't he, Jonah?

02:17.320 --> 02:18.309
- Thanks.
- You bet your boots!

02:18.421 --> 02:19.410
Let me tell you something.

02:20.256 --> 02:24.659
Them promoters ain't got a chance
of turning me down tonight, have they?

02:25.028 --> 02:28.020
- No, they'll grab you up.
- Here, feel that muscle.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.161
- It's getting big, ain't it, Jonah?
- Sure.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.633
Look at those punch muscles in the back.

02:32.702 --> 02:36.001
I'm just as good right now
as I was in the old days.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.472
- You betcha!
- You know I am.

02:39.075 --> 02:43.774
Tell you what you do, you stay here
and play with Jonah a little while.

02:44.447 --> 02:47.746
I'm going to run over
and play a little of that there Kelly pool.

02:47.984 --> 02:51.010
Champ, you've had enough exercise
for today.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.921
This ain't exercise.
This is just a little let-down...

02:55.992 --> 02:58.085
a relaxation, you know?

03:00.330 --> 03:02.730
Hey, Champ! Champ, wait a minute.

03:07.503 --> 03:11.064
Oh, no! You know I wouldn't.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.074
Didn't I tell you
I wasn't going to drink anymore?

03:13.142 --> 03:16.839
I haven't had a drink for three weeks
and you know I wouldn't take a drink...

03:16.913 --> 03:19.643
going to meet them promoters tonight,
don't you?

03:20.416 --> 03:21.440
Goodbye.

03:28.925 --> 03:30.085
Champ!

03:30.994 --> 03:33.622
There ain't no pool tables in that place.

03:37.066 --> 03:39.933
Doggone if I didn't forget that!

03:49.712 --> 03:53.512
This one shows him wearing
the diamond belt. Looks great, don't he?

03:57.153 --> 03:59.815
There he is,
right after the bout with Battling Kelly.

03:59.889 --> 04:01.948
Look at him, not even a scratch.

04:02.025 --> 04:04.289
Sure, he was the greatest fighter
in his day.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.759
Now, here he is...

04:09.198 --> 04:10.790
How did that get among these?

04:11.968 --> 04:15.165
Now, this one here
shows you his muscular development.

04:17.273 --> 04:18.762
All there, ain't he?

04:27.583 --> 04:30.416
Hey, Dominick, have you seen the Champ?

04:30.486 --> 04:33.046
No, he ain't been over here.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.582
All right, gang.

04:40.330 --> 04:43.822
Wait here, gang. Hey, come on.

04:58.581 --> 05:02.517
Boy, oh boy.
Give me another drink, Louie.

05:02.585 --> 05:04.382
Nix, Champ. Forget it, Louie!

05:04.454 --> 05:07.321
Well, if it ain't a little spitball.
Go ahead, Louie!

05:07.390 --> 05:11.258
Those promoters from Los Angeles
are up at the place waiting for you.

05:11.327 --> 05:12.988
Oh, darn it, I forgot.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.553
You can't let them see
you've been drinking.

05:16.032 --> 05:18.933
Get some ice and tell Curley
to open you a can of tomatoes.

05:19.002 --> 05:20.264
Okay.

05:20.336 --> 05:22.531
They've been there for over an hour.

05:22.605 --> 05:25.073
Gosh, why did you have to
go on a binge tonight?

05:25.141 --> 05:29.635
Listen at him bawling me out.
I'm gonna be good from now on, Dink.

05:29.846 --> 05:33.475
- Honest, I am.
- You said you'd behave. Oh, gee whiz!

05:34.350 --> 05:36.716
- Rub his neck with the ice.
- Okay.

05:38.521 --> 05:41.854
- Come on, Champ, drink. It'll do you good.
- Drink? Sure.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.125
No, that ain't what I ordered.

05:46.195 --> 05:49.631
- Boy, you got to straighten up.
- I'm all right.

05:51.601 --> 05:55.662
- Who's dribbling down my back?
- He's coming around now.

05:55.738 --> 05:56.796
Okay.

06:05.048 --> 06:08.848
- See if you can stand up.
- Oh, I can stand up all right.

06:09.118 --> 06:13.179
I'm all right. Your old man's okay.

06:14.090 --> 06:17.856
I'm always okay.

06:21.397 --> 06:24.093
You guys better scram now.
I got him, Jonah.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.293
Okay, Dink.

06:25.735 --> 06:28.203
The air didn't make you feel bad,
did it, Champ?

06:28.271 --> 06:30.034
No, I feel good.

06:32.175 --> 06:36.111
- Put your feet out one after another.
- That is a good idea.

06:36.512 --> 06:38.980
Ain't no more than fair.
We can do better than that.

06:39.048 --> 06:42.381
Only, seeing you guys
came all the way from Los Angeles...

06:42.585 --> 06:45.418
- Live and let live, that's my motto.
- Sure.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.252
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Andy.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.386
Hello.

06:53.463 --> 06:55.727
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

06:55.798 --> 06:58.266
Business. Hello, there.

06:58.434 --> 06:59.867
- Hi, big boy.
- Hi.

07:01.304 --> 07:02.896
- Hello.
- How are you?

07:02.972 --> 07:04.234
Okay.

07:09.812 --> 07:11.404
There you are, Champ.

07:13.616 --> 07:15.982
- What's your proposition?
- How's your condition, Andy?

07:16.052 --> 07:18.282
He's tip-top. Better than he ever was.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.379
Sure, ain't stopped training a minute.
Hardly.

07:20.456 --> 07:22.856
We got him doing roadwork,
skipping a rope, shadow boxing.

07:22.925 --> 07:25.485
Why, only last week
he tore up three punching bags.

07:25.561 --> 07:28.587
Certainly. We could've matched him
with Gene Tunney, if Gene hadn't quit.

07:28.664 --> 07:29.858
Yeah?

07:45.448 --> 07:46.813
Something I ate.

07:49.118 --> 07:52.246
Booze-fighting and box-fighting don't mix.
You know that.

07:52.488 --> 07:55.286
- I don't get you.
- Why, you're cockeyed right now!

07:58.761 --> 08:00.786
What do you mean, I'm cockeyed?

08:00.863 --> 08:03.855
Just like you were
the night you lost the Championship.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.127
Yeah?

08:05.601 --> 08:07.159
Sit down!

08:08.404 --> 08:09.803
You big palooka!

08:12.775 --> 08:13.969
The mug.

08:14.043 --> 08:15.533
Is that all right?

08:23.252 --> 08:26.517
Of all the nights,
you would pick tonight to get stinking!

08:26.656 --> 08:30.057
- Yes, and I could...
- Lay off of me will you?

08:30.359 --> 08:34.318
Go on, scram.
You, too, Sponge. Get out of here.

08:49.212 --> 08:51.772
You don't believe what they said
about me being drunk...

08:51.847 --> 08:54.577
the night I lost the Championship,
do you, Dink?

08:55.685 --> 08:56.709
No.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.878
All right.

10:49.365 --> 10:51.458
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

11:05.681 --> 11:09.276
I'm gonna lay off the booze, word of honor.

11:13.656 --> 11:15.920
I'm not gonna gamble anymore.

11:20.363 --> 11:22.160
You hear what I said, Dink?

11:23.265 --> 11:25.733
Yeah, I heard you, Champ.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.575
You ain't mad at me, are you?

11:38.714 --> 11:40.773
No, I ain't mad.

11:43.819 --> 11:48.188
- Well, goodnight, Dink.
- Goodnight, Champ.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.992
If the Champ wins this fight,
he says he's gonna buy me a horse.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.221
Hey, Kadinkus. Hey, Dinkey.

15:08.424 --> 15:11.825
Here, spit on it for luck.

15:13.195 --> 15:14.287
Attaboy!

15:43.292 --> 15:46.056
You know that cartwheel
that you spit on for good luck?

15:46.128 --> 15:49.620
Well, it brought it!
I made 14 straight passes...

15:49.698 --> 15:52.690
and doubled up each time.
And was Joe sore!

15:53.068 --> 15:55.628
Oh, boy, he was sore.

15:56.338 --> 15:57.828
Oh, he's burned up.

16:11.854 --> 16:13.253
Get a load of this.

16:15.157 --> 16:16.488
It's yourn.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.189
Thanks, Champ.

16:35.277 --> 16:36.266
Hey.

16:37.446 --> 16:39.641
Genuine Stetson.

16:40.983 --> 16:42.143
Feel the felt.

16:44.553 --> 16:46.145
That's yourn, too.

16:47.790 --> 16:49.280
Thanks, Champ.

17:05.874 --> 17:08.809
Hey, Dink. Come here and have a look.

17:12.414 --> 17:15.348
- Could you go for that?
- You mean the...

17:15.416 --> 17:18.284
The horse, sure. It belongs to you.
It's yourn!

17:18.520 --> 17:21.147
- Where'd you get it?
- Oh, I won it from Joe.

17:21.223 --> 17:22.484
- You did?
- Yeah.

17:22.558 --> 17:23.888
Hooray!

17:26.895 --> 17:30.763
- Gee! Mine?
- Sure he's yourn, just like I said.

17:30.833 --> 17:32.994
- Look at that. Ain't he swell?
- Gee!

17:33.102 --> 17:37.232
- He's a race horse, ain't he?
- Well, he was in a race once.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.131
- What's his name?
- They call him Butterfly.

17:41.443 --> 17:42.842
- Butterfly?
- Yeah.

17:43.112 --> 17:45.808
That's a heck of a name
for a swell horse like this.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.143
We got to change it.

17:47.216 --> 17:50.276
I tell you, we'll call him
"Little Champ" after you.

17:50.352 --> 17:52.377
That ain't a bad idea, huh?

17:52.454 --> 17:56.550
- And we can enter him in a race soon.
- Sure. We can fix him up, can't we, Tim?

17:56.625 --> 17:59.992
- I should hope to tell you.
- Gee, can I sit on him?

18:00.262 --> 18:03.925
Well, I guess he's been sat on before.
Alley!

18:04.032 --> 18:05.659
Oops-a-daisy! Hey!

18:06.568 --> 18:10.368
- Hey, give me my hat.
- Isn't he a swell horse?

18:10.439 --> 18:12.270
Yeah, sure he's swell.

18:12.374 --> 18:16.003
Gee. Oh, don't do that.
Somebody might be looking.

18:16.078 --> 18:18.740
Oh, what do we care
whether they look or not?

18:19.114 --> 18:22.572
Gee, I'll bet he can go a mile
in 20 minutes!

18:22.751 --> 18:25.311
I bet he can go a mile in just-like-that.

18:59.321 --> 19:00.811
How are you today?

19:01.824 --> 19:06.022
Hello, beautiful baby! Baby, hello.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.823
Oh, don't you do that to your mama.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.557
- How is he?
- Great.

19:09.631 --> 19:12.259
Baby, you're gonna win a big old race.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.395
- Mr. Carlton.
- Yes?

19:14.469 --> 19:16.937
I'm from <i>The Herald-Examiner.</i>
Would you and Mrs. Carlton mind...

19:17.005 --> 19:19.166
- posing for a picture with Blue Boy?
- Not at all.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.333
- Thanks.
- Linda.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.570
- Yes, darling?
- We're going to have our pictures taken.

19:22.644 --> 19:23.702
Well, well. Come on, Blue Boy.

19:23.779 --> 19:25.747
Now, Blue Boy belongs to Mrs. Carlton,
doesn't he?

19:25.814 --> 19:28.339
- Yes, he does.
- A birthday gift from my husband.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.408
- I see he's a favorite today.
- Who? My husband?

19:30.485 --> 19:31.543
No, Blue Boy.

19:31.620 --> 19:34.783
- My husband's a favorite every day.
- Step just a little closer.

19:34.857 --> 19:36.017
- Like this?
- Just a little closer.

19:36.091 --> 19:39.185
Now, nice smile. That's it.
Fine. That's good.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.924
Say, lady, I wouldn't bet on
that horse if I was you.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.167
- You wouldn't?
- No.

19:47.703 --> 19:50.968
If you got any money,
you better stick it on my horse here.

19:55.577 --> 19:58.512
- Is this your horse?
- Sure, it's my horse.

19:59.848 --> 20:02.043
Well, he's a pretty good-looking animal.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.883
Pretty good-looking, my eye!
He's gonna win the race today.

20:06.221 --> 20:09.884
Well, I think if you know,
I'll just have to put some money on him.

20:10.192 --> 20:12.183
- What's his name?
- Little Champ.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.454
Little Champ?

20:14.596 --> 20:15.824
What's your name?

20:15.964 --> 20:17.295
Dink. What's yours?

20:17.366 --> 20:19.129
- Linda.
- Hi, Linda.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.296
I think Dink's a pretty name.

20:22.371 --> 20:26.535
- Well, Linda ain't a bad name, either.
- Tony...

20:28.477 --> 20:31.674
this young man says that
his horse is gonna win this race.

20:31.747 --> 20:34.375
Well, now, that may be a good hunch.

20:35.584 --> 20:37.176
What's the name of the horse?

20:37.252 --> 20:39.345
- Little Champ.
- Little Champ, eh?

20:40.022 --> 20:42.115
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

20:42.424 --> 20:45.689
- I'll bet $50 on him.
- $50?

20:46.295 --> 20:47.922
Gee, that's a lot of money.

20:48.263 --> 20:51.061
How about it, Dink? Is that a safe bet?

20:51.266 --> 20:54.997
Plenty safe!
I'd bet my last two bits on him.

20:55.904 --> 20:58.839
Say, Dink,
I don't think I've met your little friend.

20:58.907 --> 21:01.467
Oh, this is Jonah, my pal.
Meet Miss Linda.

21:01.576 --> 21:03.635
- Glad to know you, Miss Linda.
- How do you do, Jonah?

21:03.712 --> 21:05.703
- I'm glad to meet you.
- So am I.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.276
- He's colored.
- So he is.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.980
- Kind of a pretty color.
- Yeah, ain't it, Jonah?

21:13.188 --> 21:14.314
Sure.

21:22.798 --> 21:23.856
Hi, Dink.

21:23.932 --> 21:25.490
Hey, Benny, come here.

21:26.468 --> 21:29.335
Hey, now, listen.
Little Champ is fit to run, see?

21:29.404 --> 21:31.099
As fit as we can make him.

21:31.173 --> 21:35.166
Now, when you start off,
you get him up on top, see...

21:35.243 --> 21:37.438
and then give him his head
and let him roll...

21:37.512 --> 21:41.380
and if he starts loafing on you,
you just give him the gun, see?

21:41.450 --> 21:43.748
Andy, the guy was
right in the next stall to me.

21:43.819 --> 21:46.652
- Who was with him? Linda?
- Yes. There he is now.

21:54.963 --> 21:56.123
Hello, Andy.

21:56.231 --> 22:00.895
- I thought you never came West.
- We're spending the winter in California.

22:00.969 --> 22:03.961
- Meaning...
- Linda and I.

22:04.039 --> 22:05.131
Yeah.

22:06.842 --> 22:08.070
Okay.

22:10.345 --> 22:12.313
- The nerve of that guy.
- What did he say, Andy?

22:12.381 --> 22:15.373
- Oh, nothing.
- Can you beat that?

22:16.151 --> 22:20.178
<i>They're coming out for the fifth race.</i>
<i>Number one is Chester Queen.</i>

22:20.255 --> 22:23.486
<i>Number two, Phillip Ramble.</i>
<i>Number three, Romp.</i>

22:23.859 --> 22:27.056
<i>Number four, Capt. Gilbert.</i>
<i>Number five, Blue Boy.</i>

22:27.129 --> 22:30.428
<i>- Number six, Little Champ.</i>
- Come on, line up that horse!

22:30.499 --> 22:32.933
<i>Number seven, Van Ettish.</i>
<i>Number eight, Selma Bobby.</i>

22:35.771 --> 22:37.739
<i>Chester Queen goes through the barrier.</i>

22:37.806 --> 22:39.330
- Did you place the bet?
- Yes.

22:39.408 --> 22:40.932
<i>Now they're taking him back to his stall.</i>

22:41.009 --> 22:43.569
<i>They're getting set. They're moving in.</i>
<i>Little Champ is fractious.</i>

22:43.645 --> 22:45.203
<i>There goes Little Champ</i>
<i>through the barrier.</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:48.613
Why, Tony, dear,
you look as if you had seen a ghost.

22:48.683 --> 22:49.911
<i>Now they're lining up once again...</i>

22:49.985 --> 22:51.043
I have.

22:51.653 --> 22:53.518
<i>They're getting set.</i>
<i>They've lined up evenly.</i>

22:53.588 --> 22:55.783
<i>They're off! There they go!</i>

22:58.593 --> 23:00.925
<i>Going past the grandstand the first time...</i>

23:00.996 --> 23:02.964
<i>Capt. Gilbert leads by a head.</i>

23:03.031 --> 23:07.491
<i>Blue Boy in second by a neck.</i>
<i>Little Champ is third by a half-length.</i>

23:09.404 --> 23:14.364
<i>Blue Boy leading easily by one length.</i>
<i>Capt. Gilbert second by a length.</i>

23:14.443 --> 23:17.003
<i>Van Ettish, fourth by a half-length.</i>

23:17.079 --> 23:19.343
<i>Little Champ dropping back into the pack.</i>

23:19.414 --> 23:20.608
Stop pulling my hair!

23:20.682 --> 23:23.742
<i>Swing around the turn</i>
<i>into the backstretch.</i>

23:24.219 --> 23:27.620
<i>Capt. Gilbert creeping up</i>
<i>on Blue Boy for the lead.</i>

23:27.689 --> 23:29.350
<i>They're well out in front. And now...</i>

23:29.424 --> 23:31.756
<i>Little Champ is moving up on the leaders.</i>

23:31.827 --> 23:34.455
<i>It looks like Little Champ has a chance yet.</i>

23:36.364 --> 23:37.456
<i>Blue Boy is first...</i>

23:37.532 --> 23:40.865
<i>but Little Champ moving up fast.</i>
<i>He's moving up fast.</i>

23:40.936 --> 23:42.335
<i>What a race!</i>

23:43.505 --> 23:48.499
<i>Little Champ is now coming right out</i>
<i>in front. He's out to win! He's out to win!</i>

23:49.611 --> 23:52.512
<i>There they come, down the stretch!</i>

23:53.448 --> 23:55.348
<i>Wow! He stumbled.</i>

23:55.750 --> 23:59.709
<i>What a shame, he had the race won.</i>
<i>There they go, past the finish.</i>

23:59.788 --> 24:04.521
<i>Blue Boy wins!</i>
<i>Capt. Gilbert, second, and Romp is third.</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:15.701
- Are you all right, Benny?
- No, Dink, he's all right.

24:15.770 --> 24:18.671
- He's all right.
- He's killed!

24:18.740 --> 24:22.972
No, he's all right. Here, keep your chin up.

24:23.044 --> 24:25.444
Oh, he's killed, I know it, by golly!

24:25.514 --> 24:26.913
No, he's all right.

24:27.015 --> 24:28.004
How do you know?

24:28.083 --> 24:29.072
Dink, he's all right.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.717
- He's broke his leg, that's what he did!
- No, his leg's all right, Dink.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.652
He's got for sure a broken leg.

24:34.990 --> 24:37.720
- No, keep your chin up. He's all right.
- All right, Dink.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.752
He's all right, Dink. There you are.

24:39.828 --> 24:41.887
- No...
- Look, he's all right.

24:41.963 --> 24:43.692
He just stalled and lost his wind.

24:43.798 --> 24:47.564
Look at that. He's all right, sure.

24:48.036 --> 24:52.166
- Go on and pet him. Attaboy.
- How are you, Little Champ? Gee wiz.

24:52.674 --> 24:56.110
- See, I told you the horse was all right.
- Sure, I told you.

24:56.845 --> 24:58.779
- I told you.
- I told you.

24:58.847 --> 25:01.509
- You're crazy!
- I told you!

25:03.385 --> 25:06.718
Tony! Look at that man with Dink!

25:09.357 --> 25:11.848
Yes, Linda, it's Andy.

25:14.329 --> 25:16.160
I thought so.

25:18.466 --> 25:21.060
- Then Dink is...
- Possibly.

25:23.438 --> 25:28.341
- Oh, Tony, let's go and see.
- No, you stay here, dear. I'll find out.

25:29.144 --> 25:31.476
- Gee, Dink, that sure was tough.
- That's okay.

25:31.546 --> 25:32.570
- Is he hurt?
- No.

25:32.647 --> 25:34.581
- He didn't break his leg, did he?
- Course not.

25:34.649 --> 25:37.777
I was supposed to buy groceries
with them two bits I lost.

25:37.852 --> 25:39.786
- What did you do, lose two bits?
- Yes, sir.

25:39.854 --> 25:42.482
- All right, now don't go gambling anymore.
- Thanks.

25:42.557 --> 25:43.615
You're welcome.

25:43.692 --> 25:45.887
Go on, take him over to the stables.

25:53.335 --> 25:54.927
Sure tough on the kid.

25:55.103 --> 25:57.469
Not so good on us, neither.
We're flat again.

25:57.539 --> 26:00.406
- Yeah, well, we've been broke before.
- Yeah.

26:04.112 --> 26:05.272
- Andy.
- Yeah?

26:06.514 --> 26:08.709
- Alone.
- All right.

26:10.952 --> 26:12.749
Is Dink Linda's child?

26:13.521 --> 26:16.979
Well, if I remember correctly,
she had something to do with it.

26:18.126 --> 26:19.457
She'd like to see him, Andy.

26:19.527 --> 26:22.394
No, she washed the both of us up
a long time ago, didn't she?

26:22.464 --> 26:25.456
Your marriage to Linda was a mistake.
There was no love in it.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.024
Oh, at that time
you were World's Champion...

26:28.103 --> 26:29.695
glamorous, important.

26:29.771 --> 26:32.467
- She was fascinated.
- Yeah, I wasn't in her class.

26:32.540 --> 26:36.533
That was the mistake.
You came along and she gave me the gate.

26:36.745 --> 26:39.873
Well, that's done with, Andy.
Let Linda see the boy.

26:39.981 --> 26:42.950
No! The court gave me the custody
of the kid and I'm keeping him.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.987
- You got a kid of your own, ain't you?
- Yes, we've got a little girl.

26:46.121 --> 26:47.110
Yeah.

26:47.322 --> 26:51.691
- But Dink is Linda's child, too.
- No, she's got you and a new kid.

26:51.793 --> 26:54.785
I got Dink and we remain as is.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.661
She'd give anything in the world
to talk to him, Andy.

26:57.732 --> 26:59.063
Money, if you needed it.

26:59.134 --> 27:03.901
If I needed it?
Gee, I'm just crawling with money.

27:04.839 --> 27:07.706
I'm round-shouldered
from carrying it around, Tony.

27:07.842 --> 27:09.207
Here's $100 now.

27:09.277 --> 27:13.077
Bring him to the hotel in the morning
and there'll be another $100.

27:13.682 --> 27:18.415
Well, I'm not very crazy
about doing this, Tony.

27:19.921 --> 27:23.448
When a fellow's got a lot of
bad breaks and things are tough...

27:23.525 --> 27:27.518
why, he'll do things that he won't do
when everything's flush, you know?

27:28.596 --> 27:31.463
- I'll bring him over.
- Thanks a lot, Andy.

27:31.533 --> 27:32.625
Okay.

27:47.349 --> 27:50.341
Now, let's see how you look.
Turn around front.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.611
There's one of those tags.

27:54.656 --> 27:59.616
Now, listen. When you go up there
I want you to act like a gentleman...

27:59.694 --> 28:01.127
just like your father is.

28:01.196 --> 28:02.288
You wish something?

28:02.364 --> 28:04.798
Do you have to wish for something
around here?

28:05.867 --> 28:08.199
Now you're all set. All right.

28:08.703 --> 28:12.571
All right, Sponge, you take him up there
and don't let him out of your sight.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.505
And don't forget that other $100,
do you hear?

28:14.576 --> 28:16.373
You leave it to me, boy.

28:18.546 --> 28:19.706
Ain't you coming?

28:19.781 --> 28:22.682
- No, I'm gonna wait here.
- Come on, Dink.

28:24.986 --> 28:26.715
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

28:29.157 --> 28:32.183
You got another one of those things
right there on you.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.961
- Oh, gosh!
- Can you beat that?

28:37.832 --> 28:40.494
Now, let's see. Turn around.
Take off your hat.

28:46.841 --> 28:50.208
I thought I told you
to wash them this morning.

28:50.412 --> 28:53.472
- Well, I washed my ears good enough.
- Well you didn't wash in back.

28:53.548 --> 28:56.381
Now go up there
and be a gentleman just like I am.

28:56.684 --> 28:59.244
Don't forget that other $100. Go on.

28:59.521 --> 29:01.682
Everything will be all right, Andy.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.631
I got to go in and collect some dough first.
You wait here.

29:17.038 --> 29:20.405
- I'd like to see Mrs. Carlton, please.
- Come right in. She's expecting you.

29:20.475 --> 29:21.669
Thank you.

29:59.347 --> 30:01.713
Some gum. Gee.

30:04.486 --> 30:06.283
Think I'll take three more.

30:07.288 --> 30:09.518
I'd better not leave any there.

30:15.363 --> 30:19.060
Some candy. Think I'll take some.

30:30.879 --> 30:32.073
What's in here?

30:33.781 --> 30:34.907
Cigarettes.

30:34.983 --> 30:37.577
Boy, I think I'll bring some home
for the Champ.

30:45.860 --> 30:47.623
Guess that's enough.

31:26.601 --> 31:28.592
Hi there, Champ!

31:32.040 --> 31:35.737
What are you doing up on that roof?
Get down from there.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.968
Come on, before I knock your ears off.

31:42.417 --> 31:43.714
Hello.

31:44.252 --> 31:45.241
Hello.

31:54.862 --> 31:57.888
- Do you like fairy tales?
- No.

31:58.499 --> 32:01.798
Have you read the one
about the Sleeping Beauty?

32:03.004 --> 32:06.531
It's about a princess
that slept 1,000 years.

32:08.109 --> 32:12.478
That's a lot of hooey.
How could anyone sleep 1,000 years?

32:13.448 --> 32:15.439
It's only a fairy tale.

32:16.551 --> 32:18.075
I'll say it is.

32:18.286 --> 32:21.517
And all the time she was sleeping,
didn't she ever eat?

32:21.589 --> 32:24.183
It doesn't say anything about that.

32:25.226 --> 32:27.524
Did you ever try going without breakfast?

32:29.731 --> 32:32.529
Try it sometime
and see how empty you get.

32:32.600 --> 32:36.661
And this princess goes for 1,000 years
without even eating a sandwich.

32:37.205 --> 32:41.301
- Bushwa.
- I'm awfully glad you're my brother.

32:45.647 --> 32:47.239
The dame's nuts.

32:55.323 --> 32:56.688
Come here.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.288
- How far can you spit?
- I don't know.

33:03.998 --> 33:05.124
You watch me.

33:09.704 --> 33:13.606
- See?
- Okay, Dink. Inside.

33:15.510 --> 33:16.568
Come on.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.587
- Oh, hello, Linda.
- Hello, Dink.

33:29.691 --> 33:31.124
My, I'm glad to see you.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.357
Say, I'm awful sorry
about you losing your dough yesterday.

33:36.497 --> 33:38.795
That was all right, Dink.
Won't you sit down?

33:40.301 --> 33:42.599
Ain't that the reason
why you wanted to see me?

33:43.271 --> 33:46.035
- No, that's not the reason.
- Ain't it, Linda?

33:47.842 --> 33:48.831
Gee.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.976
This ain't a bad dump you got here,
you know that?

33:52.046 --> 33:55.311
- You like it? I'm glad you do, Dink.
- Yeah.

33:55.950 --> 34:00.250
The Champ and me ain't fixed up as swell
as this, but our joint's more lively.

34:02.223 --> 34:04.817
It's right above the Greek's saloon,
you know.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.619
And I like to listen to the piano playing...

34:08.029 --> 34:10.520
while I'm waiting for the Champ
to come home nights.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.730
Does he leave you alone
at night much, Dink?

34:14.268 --> 34:16.793
No, he takes me
pretty near every place he goes...

34:17.438 --> 34:19.065
especially when he shoots dice.

34:19.474 --> 34:23.034
I'm good luck to him.
But when he goes on a binge...

34:23.878 --> 34:26.438
I wait up in the room till he comes home.

34:26.514 --> 34:28.208
Then I have to put him to bed.

34:28.549 --> 34:30.574
- Yes, I know.
- You do?

34:33.955 --> 34:38.016
Dink, you're awfully fond of your father,
aren't you?

34:38.525 --> 34:40.585
I mean, you like him an awful lot.

34:41.596 --> 34:46.498
Like him? Gee, the Champ's
the greatest guy in the whole world.

34:48.703 --> 34:50.830
Gee, you ought to meet him sometime.

34:51.139 --> 34:53.607
I'm telling you, you'd like him.

34:59.781 --> 35:02.614
- I have met him, Dink.
- You have?

35:06.988 --> 35:09.252
Hasn't your father told you who I am?

35:10.625 --> 35:15.153
I don't know. He says you're some dame
with a lot of jack.

35:17.832 --> 35:20.357
Has he ever talked to you
about your mother?

35:22.003 --> 35:25.495
Well, you see, she kicked the bucket
before I was born.

35:28.743 --> 35:30.267
Did he tell you that?

35:32.647 --> 35:34.478
I heard it some place.

35:40.488 --> 35:43.116
Dink, I'm your mother.

35:48.930 --> 35:52.388
- What you trying to do, kid me?
- No, Dink.

35:53.434 --> 35:56.403
I really am your mother. Cross my heart.

35:58.039 --> 36:01.099
Well, then, why ain't you living with
the Champ and me?

36:02.844 --> 36:05.210
Well, you see, we disagreed...

36:06.314 --> 36:09.044
and I'm married to Mr. Carlton now.

36:09.817 --> 36:13.344
That little girl you were talking to
is your little half-sister.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.491
Well, then, you ain't married
to the Champ anymore?

36:19.827 --> 36:22.295
Well, then, I guess you're not my mother.

36:29.136 --> 36:31.502
What you crying about?

36:31.572 --> 36:34.837
Oh, Dink. Dink, I am your mother.

36:35.543 --> 36:39.309
Nothing that ever happened between
your father and me can alter that.

36:40.648 --> 36:44.584
Well, you don't need to cry about it.
I like you.

36:45.353 --> 36:49.551
- Do you, Dink? Do you?
- Sure.

36:55.263 --> 36:58.357
Dink, wouldn't you kiss me?

36:59.533 --> 37:02.525
Oh, no, Linda, I don't kiss dames.

37:03.671 --> 37:05.832
Oh, please, Dink, just once.

37:07.275 --> 37:08.970
Well, what's the good in it?

37:10.111 --> 37:12.841
It would make me awfully happy
if you would.

37:15.082 --> 37:16.208
Well...

37:36.037 --> 37:39.973
Well, they wanted that one thing very...
Well, they wanted it.

37:40.074 --> 37:42.042
- And that was all there was to it.
- Okay, Sponge.

37:42.109 --> 37:43.599
- All set?
- Yeah.

37:43.778 --> 37:46.178
- Bye.
- So long.

37:46.380 --> 37:49.315
Say, come down to Tijuana sometime
and I'll show you around.

37:49.383 --> 37:51.374
- Thank you.
- So long.

37:51.452 --> 37:52.510
So long, Dink.

37:52.586 --> 37:55.020
Well, Tony, good... So long.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.713
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

37:57.658 --> 37:58.920
Goodbye, Dink.

37:59.627 --> 38:00.753
Goodbye.

38:02.630 --> 38:07.329
Oh, Tony! We can't let that baby stay
in that atmosphere another minute...

38:07.401 --> 38:08.993
now that we've found him.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.300
I'll never forgive myself.

38:12.173 --> 38:14.004
We've got to get him away from it.

38:14.075 --> 38:17.533
- Tony, we've got to.
- Will you leave it to me, Linda?

38:24.218 --> 38:27.187
Hey, where did you get them cigars?

38:28.255 --> 38:30.086
She sent them to you.

38:30.157 --> 38:31.283
She...

38:31.359 --> 38:33.623
No, don't, Champ, please. I swiped them.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.226
Well, that's different then.

38:37.965 --> 38:40.525
She make any cracks about me up there?

38:41.869 --> 38:45.737
- Suppose she's got a swell joint.
- Smells nice.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.534
Got pretty flowers in the garden, too.

38:48.609 --> 38:50.873
Yeah, I guess you went around
and smelled them all, huh?

38:50.945 --> 38:53.004
All I'd do was spit on them.

38:53.080 --> 38:57.346
Yeah, I suppose our place will look
like a dump after seeing that place of hers.

39:00.287 --> 39:03.814
Well, did you get it?
Well, what are you holding out for?

39:14.368 --> 39:16.393
Here, Dink, spit on it for luck.

39:17.905 --> 39:19.873
We'll run that up to a million.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.408
Okay, Champ.

39:24.412 --> 39:25.401
Dink, that hit him.

39:25.646 --> 39:27.705
Boy, what are we going to do
with all that jack?

39:27.782 --> 39:31.309
First of all, me and Dink
is gonna get a new room.

39:31.952 --> 39:36.286
That joint down at the Greek's,
that don't smell so nice.

39:36.991 --> 39:39.357
- Maybe we'll leave Tijuana.
- Travel?

39:39.860 --> 39:42.624
Well, maybe, perhaps. You never can tell.

39:43.531 --> 39:45.761
I'm dying on my feet, Champ.

39:46.434 --> 39:49.369
Listen, we can't quit
when we're going so good.

39:49.437 --> 39:50.904
I'll quit in a minute.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.370
Dinkey, boy. Andy. Two points...

39:53.741 --> 39:55.231
There you are. That's a natural.

39:55.309 --> 39:56.799
I think we're going into a new business.

39:56.877 --> 39:59.277
Oh, you're sure hot today, ain't you, Andy?

39:59.346 --> 40:04.045
Hit them, baby.
Here, I'll show you how to make a 10.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.713
There you are. Six.
What do you want, a 10?

40:08.956 --> 40:12.289
That's a cinch. There's a 10.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.521
There he comes. There he comes, six!

40:15.596 --> 40:16.688
Andy.

40:19.166 --> 40:23.262
Here, you shoot them.
But use your own dough.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.933
- What's the point?
- $1.

40:28.042 --> 40:30.135
Well, spill it.

40:31.479 --> 40:33.674
Linda and I have a proposition
to make you, Andy.

40:33.747 --> 40:34.736
Yeah?

40:36.217 --> 40:39.846
Give us Dink for six months.
We want to do something for the boy.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.012
Like what?

40:41.088 --> 40:45.081
Well, send him to school.
Give him a different environment.

40:45.259 --> 40:47.750
He's got plenty of environment right here.

40:48.395 --> 40:51.091
I know you love him, Andy,
and Dink loves you.

40:51.832 --> 40:55.029
But this sort of...
Oh, give the boy a chance.

40:56.070 --> 40:57.537
Let Linda have him.

40:58.606 --> 41:01.074
I thought she'd pull something like this.

41:02.510 --> 41:06.276
I got to keep counting
to keep from smacking you down.

41:07.314 --> 41:09.908
I've got close to $3,000 on that table.

41:10.217 --> 41:14.153
I'm going to send that boy to school
and I'm going to be the one...

41:14.221 --> 41:16.155
to dress him up.

41:16.991 --> 41:18.891
He and me is going to travel.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.560
If we wanted to be nasty,
we could take the boy away from you.

41:24.598 --> 41:28.500
You know, you're not a very good father.

41:31.438 --> 41:36.375
You better go on while the going's good.
Shove off!

41:38.679 --> 41:42.012
Give me them dice. I'll shoot $100!

41:43.751 --> 41:45.981
Let's go home, Champ.

41:52.026 --> 41:55.393
- There's a natural seven.
- $5.

41:55.462 --> 41:57.430
Don't you want me
to spit on the dice for luck?

41:57.498 --> 42:00.365
You? You'd give them halitosis.

42:19.153 --> 42:21.178
Okay, Andy, sign it.

42:25.192 --> 42:28.093
Gee! It is Dink's horse, Whitey.

42:29.163 --> 42:31.757
I must have gone nuts
to gamble him away.

42:34.201 --> 42:36.829
Dink will die if he finds it out.

42:38.772 --> 42:40.569
I'll tell you what I'll do.

42:40.841 --> 42:43.366
If you can raise the money
within a couple of days...

42:43.444 --> 42:45.241
I'll let you have him back.

42:58.559 --> 43:00.424
We won't say nothing, Andy.

43:02.096 --> 43:03.256
Goodnight, boy.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.456
Goodnight.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.401
Dink.

43:15.843 --> 43:19.301
Hey, Dink. We're heading for home.

43:23.150 --> 43:25.050
What time is it, Champ?

43:25.152 --> 43:26.483
Morning.

43:27.921 --> 43:29.946
Come on. You want me to carry you?

43:30.024 --> 43:31.719
No, I got legs.

43:45.472 --> 43:47.337
Did you have bad luck?

43:48.375 --> 43:49.569
Yes.

43:51.211 --> 43:53.645
Well, tomorrow's another day.

43:55.449 --> 43:56.711
Cheer up.

43:56.784 --> 43:58.308
Goodnight, Andy.

43:58.686 --> 43:59.914
So long.

44:10.297 --> 44:11.423
Come on.

44:11.498 --> 44:14.058
No, I can do that, Dink.

44:14.702 --> 44:16.795
Here, you're all tired out.

44:18.639 --> 44:20.334
Give me your hoof.

44:26.347 --> 44:29.043
You ain't feeling sick, are you, Champ?

44:31.985 --> 44:34.351
No. I feel fine.

44:41.161 --> 44:43.652
I got to get up early this morning.

44:44.365 --> 44:47.960
I got to go over to the track
and see Little Champ.

44:48.302 --> 44:50.702
You know, I ain't seen that guy...

44:50.771 --> 44:52.966
since day before yesterday.

44:54.708 --> 44:55.936
Well...

44:56.543 --> 44:59.341
you better sleep late this morning.

45:00.047 --> 45:02.743
Growing kids need a lot of sleep, Dink.

45:05.085 --> 45:06.677
Come on, hop in.

45:18.699 --> 45:20.997
Ain't you coming to bed, Champ?

45:22.202 --> 45:24.636
Sure. In a little while.

45:37.785 --> 45:39.685
Well, goodnight, Champ.

45:46.293 --> 45:47.885
Goodnight, Dink.

46:08.248 --> 46:11.308
And that's McGonnigle.
He won yesterday's race.

46:11.385 --> 46:14.582
Little Champ wasn't running.
Hey, now watch, gang.

46:14.988 --> 46:16.478
Hey, Little Champ!

46:18.859 --> 46:21.692
Hey, what's the matter with you,
you old hay-burner?

46:21.762 --> 46:23.286
Ain't you got any sense?

46:23.363 --> 46:26.025
Stick your head out
when your master's voice calls you.

46:27.734 --> 46:29.224
Where's he at?

46:29.837 --> 46:30.997
Hey, look!

46:34.041 --> 46:35.440
Gee! Hey!

46:37.311 --> 46:39.040
Hey, bring my horse back!

46:39.112 --> 46:40.409
Hang on!

46:40.481 --> 46:42.676
Wait a minute, that's Dink's horse!

46:52.759 --> 46:54.989
Champ! Champ!

46:55.062 --> 46:57.462
Champ, do you know what they did?

46:57.731 --> 47:00.859
They just took Little Champ away,
just now.

47:01.268 --> 47:03.361
Yeah, I saw them.

47:03.637 --> 47:06.003
I lost him last night, Dink.

47:10.978 --> 47:12.775
I'll win him back...

47:13.113 --> 47:16.480
just as soon as I can get some dough,
I'll get him back.

47:30.697 --> 47:32.187
Now, listen, Dink...

47:33.333 --> 47:35.130
don't take it hard.

47:35.302 --> 47:39.295
I didn't know what was going on...

47:39.873 --> 47:41.704
and he went so quick...

47:42.109 --> 47:44.907
and well, you know, those things happen...

47:45.045 --> 47:47.809
and, gosh, I'm sorry about it.

47:48.315 --> 47:50.442
We're going to get him back.

47:51.618 --> 47:53.950
Come on, get your chin up.

47:54.321 --> 47:57.119
Come on, be a big fellow and get your...

47:57.457 --> 47:59.982
Go on, get that lip up before you lose it.

48:00.060 --> 48:02.494
Come on. Up with the ippy-lay.

48:02.963 --> 48:04.726
Come on. Up with the lip.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.891
Come on now. Give us a smile.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.958
Come on, a little smile.

48:09.770 --> 48:11.101
Attaboy!

48:11.271 --> 48:13.739
I'm going to get Little Champ
back for you now...

48:13.807 --> 48:16.298
just as soon as I can get a hold
of some money.

48:16.376 --> 48:18.503
- Are you?
- Sure I am.

48:18.579 --> 48:20.740
Sure, wait a minute. I got a little old...

48:20.814 --> 48:23.783
four-bit piece here you can spit on for luck.

48:24.618 --> 48:25.812
I guess.

48:27.554 --> 48:29.545
No, I don't guess I have.

48:30.891 --> 48:31.983
Well...

48:32.059 --> 48:34.721
here, spit in my hand, just for luck.

48:36.129 --> 48:37.323
Attaboy!

48:37.397 --> 48:39.126
Now we're going to get a bankroll,
you hear?

48:39.199 --> 48:40.666
And we'll get Little Champ back and...

48:51.678 --> 48:53.168
Thanks, Linda.

48:54.414 --> 48:55.904
Andy, wait.

48:57.618 --> 49:01.054
Andy, won't you reconsider
letting us have Dink?

49:02.055 --> 49:05.821
Can't you see the advantages
we could give him? A good home...

49:06.126 --> 49:08.424
decent environment, friends.

49:09.162 --> 49:11.687
We could send him to a good school.

49:12.833 --> 49:15.529
Andy, he's old enough
to decide for himself.

49:15.602 --> 49:18.036
Perhaps he'd like to live with us.

49:18.205 --> 49:20.173
Andy, won't you ask him?

49:22.976 --> 49:24.204
Well...

49:25.245 --> 49:27.304
that's fair enough, Linda.

49:29.149 --> 49:31.140
I'll ask him, we'll see what he says.

49:31.218 --> 49:32.913
- Will you, Andy?
- Sure, I will.

49:32.986 --> 49:34.681
- Promise?
- Yeah.

49:34.988 --> 49:36.888
- I'll ask him.
- Thanks.

49:40.327 --> 49:41.589
Eak-stay?

49:41.962 --> 49:43.623
O-nay. Orn-cay.

49:43.964 --> 49:45.363
Orn-cay?

49:45.866 --> 49:46.958
There.

49:47.034 --> 49:49.332
- Utter-bay and alt-say.
- Utter-bay?

49:54.174 --> 49:56.665
- Here. Alt-say and epper-pay.
- Yeah.

49:56.977 --> 49:58.774
- No epper-pay.
- No epper-pay?

49:58.845 --> 49:59.869
- Nope.
- Okay.

49:59.946 --> 50:01.208
Anks-thay.

50:05.152 --> 50:07.052
You're old enough to...

50:07.354 --> 50:10.551
make up your mind
about what you want to do, ain't you?

50:10.757 --> 50:12.156
- Sure.
- Sure.

50:12.926 --> 50:16.555
And you wouldn't like to go
to military school, would you?

50:16.730 --> 50:19.858
- What's it like?
- Well, it's just like a prison.

50:21.101 --> 50:23.968
Everybody has to dress in uniforms...

50:24.037 --> 50:26.335
and they have to drill all day...

50:26.406 --> 50:28.840
and you wouldn't like that, would you?

50:29.743 --> 50:31.404
- No.
- No.

50:34.614 --> 50:38.015
You wouldn't like to live
in a great big home, would you?

50:38.085 --> 50:40.849
One of those great big barns...

50:41.188 --> 50:43.088
nothing cozy like...

50:43.590 --> 50:46.058
well, like our joint, for instance?

50:46.460 --> 50:48.985
And you have to be dressed up all day...

50:49.062 --> 50:52.327
and wash all over
three or four times every day.

50:52.699 --> 50:55.133
You wouldn't like that, would you?

50:56.002 --> 50:58.163
- Wash three or four times a day?
- Yeah.

50:58.238 --> 50:59.933
- All over?
- Yeah.

51:00.340 --> 51:01.671
Nothing doing!

51:01.742 --> 51:04.404
You got plenty of environment
right here, ain't you?

51:04.478 --> 51:05.843
Sure, I'm full up.

51:05.912 --> 51:06.970
Full up.

51:07.047 --> 51:08.275
So am I.

51:09.382 --> 51:12.010
- Well, I got your horse back.
- You did?

51:12.285 --> 51:14.685
Little Champ? Where is he?

51:14.755 --> 51:17.383
- Down in my barn.
- Gee, that's swell!

51:17.457 --> 51:18.981
Wait a minute!

51:24.097 --> 51:25.724
Come on, Stinky!

51:25.799 --> 51:27.596
Little Champ's back!

51:31.872 --> 51:34.067
Well, you got my money, Andy?

51:35.776 --> 51:37.175
Yes.

51:37.244 --> 51:38.768
Oh, sure, yeah.

51:39.379 --> 51:41.210
How much was that?

51:41.615 --> 51:43.606
You know how much it was.

51:43.817 --> 51:45.307
$300, was it?

51:46.119 --> 51:48.883
Yeah, that's right. I guess you're right.

51:49.222 --> 51:52.123
$50, $150...

51:52.492 --> 51:54.892
$200, $250, $300...

51:55.128 --> 51:57.824
Wait, don't rush me. Don't push me, now.

51:57.898 --> 52:00.833
Wait a minute.
Let me figure this thing out.

52:01.468 --> 52:03.197
Let's see if you can...

52:03.270 --> 52:06.205
guess the number of the bill. Odd or even?

52:07.474 --> 52:09.169
You starting that game again?

52:09.242 --> 52:10.231
Well, l...

52:10.310 --> 52:12.107
Who's starting who's who and what again?

52:12.179 --> 52:14.044
- You keep out of this, will you?
- Shut your face.

52:14.114 --> 52:16.344
- Odd or even? Odd or even?
- I want my dough.

52:16.416 --> 52:18.714
Well, wait a minute. Let's go take a drink...

52:18.785 --> 52:20.150
and then we can talk it over.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.051
- Sure, that's what we want is...
- Never mind.

52:22.122 --> 52:24.522
- Go on, get out of here!
- Shut your face.

52:24.591 --> 52:26.081
Come on, odd or even?

52:26.159 --> 52:27.854
I want that dough.

52:29.696 --> 52:32.358
- Gee, don't Little Champ look great?
- Yeah.

52:32.933 --> 52:33.991
Boy!

52:34.067 --> 52:36.661
Sponge says he looks like Man O' War...

52:36.870 --> 52:39.100
only he can't run as fast yet.

52:39.172 --> 52:41.140
All he need is practice.

52:47.147 --> 52:49.308
- It' s a beef!
- Let's go see!

52:57.724 --> 52:59.487
Somebody's pinched!

52:59.626 --> 53:02.754
Let's go to the jail and find out who!
Come on!

53:07.801 --> 53:09.894
Last one there's a sissy!

53:26.553 --> 53:28.214
Come on, kill him!

53:31.024 --> 53:33.822
- Come on!
- Give him the raspberry, Dink!

53:33.894 --> 53:34.986
Okay.

53:39.266 --> 53:40.961
Get them out of here!

53:41.701 --> 53:43.965
I ain't going to stand for no...

53:44.037 --> 53:45.265
Nuts!

54:01.154 --> 54:03.850
Looks like your pappy, he done it again.

54:04.858 --> 54:05.950
Yeah.

54:17.203 --> 54:18.795
Ain't you slept?

54:20.974 --> 54:22.703
I've been thinking.

54:23.009 --> 54:24.271
Thinking?

54:27.714 --> 54:29.875
Holy mackerel, what a joint.

54:32.485 --> 54:35.682
You'd think a respectable bedbug
would have better sense...

54:35.755 --> 54:38.155
than to stay in a dump like this.

54:41.895 --> 54:44.420
Say, who started that beef, anyway?

54:46.333 --> 54:47.732
Oh, I remember.

54:48.435 --> 54:52.394
You started gambling
and lost all the dough for the kid's horse.

54:53.640 --> 54:56.734
Then you accused Whitey
of using loaded dice.

54:56.876 --> 55:00.437
Then that made Whitey sore
and then you sloughed Whitey.

55:00.981 --> 55:03.848
Boy, then things started.

55:08.154 --> 55:10.384
Well, I'd never do a thing like that.

55:10.457 --> 55:13.654
Use loaded dice.
I got caught too many times.

55:18.365 --> 55:20.629
I'm giving Dink to his mother.

55:21.935 --> 55:23.027
What?

55:23.636 --> 55:25.228
I ain't no good.

55:25.672 --> 55:27.867
He'll be better off with her.

55:29.709 --> 55:31.734
You'll have a tough time
getting rid of him.

55:31.811 --> 55:34.041
I'll get rid of him all right.

55:36.716 --> 55:38.581
Maybe he'll forget me.

55:39.152 --> 55:40.915
Kids are like that.

55:41.988 --> 55:43.853
Yeah, I know they are.

55:44.824 --> 55:46.724
I had a swell old man...

55:47.494 --> 55:51.055
but a couple of years after they hung him,
I forgot all about him.

55:55.568 --> 55:56.728
Champ?

56:01.741 --> 56:03.572
Well, Andy, in again, huh?

56:05.378 --> 56:07.903
Brought you something to eat, Champ.

56:08.481 --> 56:10.005
I'm not hungry.

56:14.554 --> 56:17.421
You take that kid over
and pack up his clothes...

56:17.857 --> 56:19.256
and then...

56:20.026 --> 56:22.893
bring him over to the hotel to his mother.

56:23.463 --> 56:24.725
What for?

56:25.598 --> 56:29.364
Because I said so. You're going to stay
with your mother from now on.

56:29.803 --> 56:32.567
Oh, no, Champ, I want to stay with you.

56:32.639 --> 56:33.833
You do?

56:34.107 --> 56:35.335
Well...

56:35.575 --> 56:39.409
that's tough because you're just
out of luck. You're not going to.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.705
What am I going to do with her?

56:42.015 --> 56:44.643
Well, you're going to go to school...

56:45.018 --> 56:46.485
and learn something...

56:46.553 --> 56:48.714
and grow up to be somebody.

56:51.991 --> 56:55.688
I'm tired of feeding you.
Let her feed you for a while.

56:56.629 --> 56:58.597
I don't like you anymore.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.600
You're hanging around
every place that I go...

57:02.335 --> 57:04.735
and I don't like you, that's all.

57:06.272 --> 57:08.365
I won't eat so much, Champ.

57:09.976 --> 57:12.103
And I won't hang around you.

57:13.113 --> 57:15.013
I'll stay up at the Greek's...

57:15.081 --> 57:17.641
and wait till you come home nights.

57:18.518 --> 57:19.746
No. No.

57:21.488 --> 57:23.979
I wish you wouldn't send me, Champ.

57:25.125 --> 57:27.320
Gee, I can go to school here.

57:28.728 --> 57:31.322
The Fathers asked me a lot of times.

57:31.731 --> 57:34.256
I could grow up to be somebody.

57:35.435 --> 57:37.335
Somebody like you.

57:37.670 --> 57:41.265
No. You're going to go to your mother's.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.477
I'm not going to have
any sniveling around.

57:46.379 --> 57:48.142
You're going to stay with her...

57:48.214 --> 57:51.672
and I'm not going to have any more
backtalk from you now, that's all.

57:51.751 --> 57:54.049
No, sir, Champ, I ain't going to go.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.179
I'm telling you I ain't gonna go!

57:56.256 --> 57:58.281
- I'm telling you I ain't gonna...
- You're going to go.

57:58.358 --> 58:00.451
- You're going to your mother's now.
- I don't want to go.

58:00.527 --> 58:03.155
Oh, no, I want to stay with you. Please!

58:03.229 --> 58:05.720
You're not going to.
You're going to your mother's, Dink.

58:05.798 --> 58:08.528
- I wanna stay with you...
- No! No! No!

58:18.411 --> 58:19.878
Okay, Champ.

58:25.385 --> 58:27.615
I'll go if you don't want me.

58:28.955 --> 58:31.651
Go on, scram out of here.

58:55.815 --> 58:57.578
Cut it out, Champ!
What are you trying to do?

58:57.650 --> 58:58.878
Gee, I hit my kid.

58:58.952 --> 59:00.886
Don't do that, Champ,
you're breaking your hand.

59:00.954 --> 59:04.048
Don't do it, Champ. What's the matter?
You going crazy?

59:31.985 --> 59:34.249
Time to go to bed, youngster.

59:45.765 --> 59:47.198
I've got good news for you, Dink.

59:47.267 --> 59:50.896
I pulled a few strings today
and your father's home again.

59:52.805 --> 59:55.205
You mean you got him out of jail?

59:57.744 --> 59:59.211
Thanks a lot.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.041
You know, Dink,
I think you're going to like New York.

01:00:03.116 --> 01:00:04.640
You'll like school, too.

01:00:04.717 --> 01:00:09.051
We thought it would be nice if you went to
the same school I attended for years.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:12.719
You'll get riding and drilling and
target practice.

01:00:12.992 --> 01:00:14.619
Was he all right?

01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:16.052
Who?

01:00:16.396 --> 01:00:18.489
Oh, yes. Yes, he was fine.

01:00:19.465 --> 01:00:21.729
Well, did he... Did he...

01:00:22.168 --> 01:00:23.931
Yes, he did.

01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:26.936
And I told him you were getting along fine.

01:00:30.743 --> 01:00:33.735
Well, that's what you'd want me
to tell him...

01:00:35.848 --> 01:00:37.145
isn't it?

01:00:39.619 --> 01:00:40.881
Isn't it?

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.280
Sure.

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:45.247
Say goodnight to Mary Lou.

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:47.082
Goodnight, Mary Lou.

01:00:47.193 --> 01:00:48.387
Goodnight, Dink.

01:00:48.461 --> 01:00:49.860
Sleep tight.

01:00:52.265 --> 01:00:54.733
Father, come and kiss me goodnight.

01:00:55.201 --> 01:00:56.793
All right, dear.

01:00:57.837 --> 01:00:59.361
Goodnight, son.

01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:00.770
Goodnight.

01:01:03.543 --> 01:01:04.737
Hello, Dink.

01:01:04.811 --> 01:01:07.006
Just thought I'd help you get settled.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.776
Here's your toothbrush and toothpaste.

01:01:10.116 --> 01:01:12.084
Could I help you, darling?

01:01:12.151 --> 01:01:14.312
I can undress myself.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.196
Got kind of a little cold, haven't you?

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:32.462
Yeah. You know...

01:01:32.538 --> 01:01:34.631
my eyes and nose, well...

01:01:34.807 --> 01:01:37.469
they've been running something awful.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:38.971
You know?

01:01:39.045 --> 01:01:40.569
That's too bad.

01:01:41.414 --> 01:01:42.506
Yeah.

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:45.717
Let me help you, huh?

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.446
No, I can do that.

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:52.585
Could I take the other one off?

01:01:52.759 --> 01:01:54.090
All right.

01:02:01.567 --> 01:02:03.091
There we are.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.838
Oh, Dink, you don't know how happy I am
to have you here.

01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:20.384
Well, I think you better go now.

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:25.517
All right, Dink.

01:02:26.793 --> 01:02:28.590
I'll go and see how Mary Lou's
getting along...

01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:30.993
then I'll come back and tuck you in, huh?

01:02:43.476 --> 01:02:44.841
San Diego...

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.842
stop here 15 minutes.

01:02:48.114 --> 01:02:49.945
Are you all undressed, dear?

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:51.381
Just about.

01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:57.515
Are you nearly ready to be tucked in?

01:03:00.126 --> 01:03:02.492
I'm already tucked in already.

01:03:12.939 --> 01:03:14.907
Gosh, I'm tired.

01:03:16.976 --> 01:03:18.910
See you in the morning, dear.

01:03:18.978 --> 01:03:20.070
Okay.

01:03:21.514 --> 01:03:22.674
Goodnight.

01:03:22.748 --> 01:03:24.079
Goodnight.

01:03:49.442 --> 01:03:50.466
You got to snap out of it, Andy.

01:03:50.543 --> 01:03:53.774
Now that we got you that fight with
those promoters, you're laying down on it.

01:03:53.846 --> 01:03:55.939
You should be doing some heavy training.

01:03:56.015 --> 01:03:57.744
Oh, what's the use?

01:03:57.817 --> 01:03:59.682
I don't need to train.

01:04:01.153 --> 01:04:03.144
All I need is some sleep.

01:04:05.191 --> 01:04:07.853
Why, if I could only get
a little shuteye, I'd...

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:10.657
We know what you're going through,
and we're with you, no kidding.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.130
But we got to grab this chance.
We may never get another one.

01:04:13.199 --> 01:04:15.759
Why, if they come up here
and find that you're not up and doing...

01:04:15.835 --> 01:04:17.496
What do I care?

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:19.800
That don't make any difference.

01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:23.638
Let them find me.
Let them take the fight away from me.

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:28.544
What's the difference?
I don't care whether I fight or not.

01:04:46.432 --> 01:04:47.592
Hello.

01:04:55.408 --> 01:04:58.002
Thought I'd come and see how you was.

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:06.083
You got a cold, ain't you?

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.677
No, I'm just sort of crying.

01:05:09.021 --> 01:05:11.046
No, no you ain't.

01:05:13.125 --> 01:05:17.221
Gee, boy, but you look swell.

01:05:19.699 --> 01:05:22.566
Ain't much life to a suit of clothes...

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:24.735
but they ain't so bad.

01:05:33.913 --> 01:05:35.881
Why, you had a manicure.

01:05:38.451 --> 01:05:40.248
What happened to your hand?

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.719
Oh, I just scratched it a little bit.

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.416
Been feeling all right again?

01:05:47.493 --> 01:05:49.358
Sure, I'm feeling fine.

01:05:49.695 --> 01:05:51.390
Gee, I'm feeling great.

01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:54.958
I haven't had a drink since I got out of jail.

01:05:55.067 --> 01:05:57.763
- Yeah?
- And I don't shoot dice no more.

01:05:57.837 --> 01:05:59.168
Gee, that's swell.

01:05:59.238 --> 01:06:01.672
- Tomorrow I'm going into training.
- No kidding?

01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:03.641
Yeah. Feel the muscle.

01:06:03.776 --> 01:06:06.108
- Gee, it's like iron.
- Just like steel.

01:06:06.178 --> 01:06:08.203
Feel the stomach. Hit it.

01:06:08.581 --> 01:06:09.980
Hit it hard.

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:14.385
Hey, did you know
I had a fight all lined up?

01:06:14.453 --> 01:06:17.115
- No!
- Sure, all set, ready to go.

01:06:17.189 --> 01:06:18.622
Gee, that's swell!

01:06:18.691 --> 01:06:21.182
Say, there ain't no reason
why I can't come back, is there?

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.354
If I do, why, I'll get us a girl
that will follow us around...

01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:27.524
and do nothing
but look after our fingernails, huh?

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.227
Couldn't we get a couple of men
to do that?

01:06:29.301 --> 01:06:31.997
Sure. We can get us four men.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:35.105
And I'll get you a new suit
and a pair of rubber boots.

01:06:35.174 --> 01:06:38.371
- Real rubber?
- Real rubber boots and a shotgun.

01:06:38.511 --> 01:06:41.036
Say, a shotgun that goes "kablooie" and...

01:06:41.113 --> 01:06:43.013
Oh boy, that's swell!

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.482
And we can travel.
And we can go down to Paris...

01:06:45.551 --> 01:06:49.043
- Georgia, and Des Moines, Missouri.
- Oh boy!

01:06:49.121 --> 01:06:50.850
- Gee, that's keen!
- Won't that be swell?

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:52.151
Yeah! Boy!

01:06:52.324 --> 01:06:53.313
Oh, gee!

01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:56.523
- You broke the window!
- What do we care?

01:06:58.698 --> 01:07:02.464
Come on, don't get your chin down there.
Come on.

01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:06.099
- Come on, hit him in the...
- Chin!

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.502
That's what I said.

01:07:32.998 --> 01:07:35.489
Andy, you ain't showed a thing yet.

01:07:39.505 --> 01:07:40.972
Look at that.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.937
You look at it. I've seen it.

01:07:50.116 --> 01:07:51.481
Gee, that guy's good.

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:53.882
Boy, look what he's doing
to his sparring partner!

01:07:53.953 --> 01:07:56.683
Dink's old man ain't got a chance.

01:08:07.433 --> 01:08:08.957
Gee, look at his left.

01:08:09.034 --> 01:08:11.502
- It's faster than lightning.
- Yeah.

01:08:12.304 --> 01:08:13.601
Boy, he's...

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:16.607
Well, what do you think
of the Mexican now?

01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:22.537
Come on, Jonah.

01:08:26.952 --> 01:08:29.443
That guy didn't look so good to me.

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:32.915
His footwork was terrible.

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:36.388
I don't think he could fight at all.

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:37.827
Not at all.

01:08:39.131 --> 01:08:42.497
Gee, Champ ain't got a chance.

01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:46.100
But this is a fight he's going into, Tim.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:48.866
Yeah.

01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:52.441
Come on, lop ears. Hot groceries.

01:08:52.645 --> 01:08:54.044
Hiya, Dink.

01:08:54.113 --> 01:08:55.546
Hello, Dink.

01:08:56.115 --> 01:08:57.673
You tired, Champ?

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.274
Well, I'm a little tired.

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.511
I got a lot of catching up to do...

01:09:01.587 --> 01:09:03.714
but I'm doing it all right.

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:06.220
I want to talk to you about that.

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:07.486
About what?

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.051
Well, about this here fight racket.

01:09:10.796 --> 01:09:12.491
I don't seem to like it.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:15.363
How come?
I thought you was strong for it.

01:09:15.434 --> 01:09:18.130
Well, I've been thinking it over,
you know, Champ?

01:09:18.203 --> 01:09:21.537
I like you lots better
when you're not training.

01:09:21.607 --> 01:09:23.165
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:09:23.542 --> 01:09:26.738
Well, for instance,
when you got a couple of drinks in you...

01:09:26.812 --> 01:09:28.837
well, you're a lot of fun.

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:31.542
I thought you didn't like me drinking.

01:09:31.951 --> 01:09:34.350
Well, I was wrong, Champ.

01:09:34.787 --> 01:09:36.778
Now that you quit gambling...

01:09:36.856 --> 01:09:39.381
I got practically nothing to spit on.

01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:43.394
Well, when I was gambling I lost all
of our dough and I lost the horse...

01:09:44.162 --> 01:09:46.961
and I think we're better off
now that I've quit.

01:09:47.032 --> 01:09:49.363
We used to have a lot of fun...

01:09:50.035 --> 01:09:52.595
and now you're training most of the time...

01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:55.265
and we don't get to see much
of each other.

01:09:55.341 --> 01:09:57.935
Hey, now, what are you getting at?

01:09:58.544 --> 01:10:01.069
Well, you was the World's Champion once.

01:10:01.146 --> 01:10:02.977
Everybody knows that.

01:10:03.048 --> 01:10:05.949
What do we care
about you being champ again?

01:10:06.385 --> 01:10:09.286
And fighting this Mexican
ain't gonna get you much.

01:10:09.355 --> 01:10:12.552
Well, if I win, it will get me $20,000.

01:10:13.092 --> 01:10:15.583
- Who cares about that?
- I do.

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:18.524
With that dough, why,
I can send you to school...

01:10:18.597 --> 01:10:22.363
and I can get Little Champ,
and you and me can travel.

01:10:23.535 --> 01:10:25.935
Oh, I don't have to go to school.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.239
You didn't go to school, I bet.

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:32.175
Yeah, I know that, but that's the reason
that you have to go to school.

01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:33.808
Hey, listen...

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:38.814
you ain't trying to get me
to throw this fight, now, are you?

01:10:39.618 --> 01:10:40.949
No, Champ.

01:10:41.253 --> 01:10:42.584
All right.

01:10:43.455 --> 01:10:44.683
Come on...

01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:46.782
let's go get some grub.

01:10:48.193 --> 01:10:50.957
No, thanks, Champ. I ain't hungry.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:54.060
I'll see you later.

01:10:56.235 --> 01:10:57.566
Oh, gee!

01:10:58.604 --> 01:11:00.367
Oh, gee whiz!

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.845
Well, what do you say, Doc?
Everything all right?

01:11:17.923 --> 01:11:20.323
I guess you'll get by all right.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:22.994
But you don't want to
work too hard at first.

01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:25.121
You know, you got to be mighty careful.

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:27.927
That old heart isn't any too strong.

01:11:28.167 --> 01:11:29.964
What do you mean?

01:11:30.469 --> 01:11:32.562
Well, it's working pretty hard.

01:11:32.638 --> 01:11:36.597
Say, listen, the last championship fight,
that old heart was doing nip-ups.

01:11:36.675 --> 01:11:37.972
Everything was all right.

01:11:38.043 --> 01:11:39.271
Come in!

01:11:40.646 --> 01:11:44.446
- Well! Hello, Tony!
- Hello, Andy.

01:11:44.516 --> 01:11:47.451
- Where did you come from?
- Linda and I came down to see the fight.

01:11:47.519 --> 01:11:48.645
Good, good.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.690
Now remember, Andy, what I told you.
Take it easy.

01:11:51.757 --> 01:11:55.318
Say, listening to you doctors
make those undertakers rich.

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:56.725
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:56.795 --> 01:11:57.887
I know.

01:11:57.963 --> 01:11:59.328
Well, Tony.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:02.890
Well, I suppose you're back
to try and get the kid again, eh?

01:12:02.968 --> 01:12:05.528
No, we know we can't do the impossible.

01:12:05.604 --> 01:12:08.630
We can't separate you and Dink.
So we're not going to try anymore.

01:12:08.707 --> 01:12:09.901
Now you got a lot of sense.

01:12:09.975 --> 01:12:12.466
Say, this is going to be some fight.

01:12:13.112 --> 01:12:17.105
I'm going to make an enchilada out of
this big palooka and eat him.

01:12:17.483 --> 01:12:19.144
Say, it's a cinch.

01:12:21.186 --> 01:12:24.314
Linda and I have been
talking things over, Andy.

01:12:26.025 --> 01:12:28.255
We don't want you to take any chances.

01:12:28.327 --> 01:12:29.555
Chances?

01:12:29.895 --> 01:12:33.797
Say, I wouldn't have that kid see me lose
for anything in the world.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.061
Dink's gonna be proud of his old man.

01:12:36.135 --> 01:12:39.935
I'm going to win that fight tonight.
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:12:43.042 --> 01:12:45.135
- Hi.
- Hello, Dink.

01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:47.144
Hello, there. Say, when did you get back?

01:12:47.212 --> 01:12:49.510
Couldn't stay away,
just had to see this fight.

01:12:49.581 --> 01:12:52.277
- Did you put any money on it?
- Did he? I'll say he did.

01:12:52.351 --> 01:12:55.946
- Yeah, you're gonna clean up too, boy!
- Andy, will you let's go, we're on next.

01:12:56.021 --> 01:12:59.286
Quit your squawking, kewpie. I'll be there.

01:12:59.358 --> 01:13:01.189
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:02.920
Good luck, Andy.

01:13:03.028 --> 01:13:05.997
- All right, this as a walkaway.
- Hello, gang!

01:13:06.165 --> 01:13:07.632
- Hi, boys!
- Good luck, Andy!

01:13:07.699 --> 01:13:08.893
Thanks.

01:13:13.205 --> 01:13:14.729
Attaboy, Andy!

01:13:15.274 --> 01:13:16.901
- What about the horse?
- Waiting outside.

01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:18.033
You got him outside?

01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:19.975
I'll have the dough for you
right after the fight.

01:13:20.045 --> 01:13:22.240
For the love of Mike, Andy. Come on!

01:14:18.837 --> 01:14:21.032
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.132
The main event of the evening:

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:24.971
ten rounds of boxing.

01:14:25.043 --> 01:14:27.841
Introducing, at 210 pounds...

01:14:28.647 --> 01:14:31.775
the former Heavyweight Champion
of the World...

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:33.374
Andy Purcell.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.389
At 205...

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.629
the Heavyweight Champion of Mexico...

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.425
Manuel Quiroga.

01:14:52.104 --> 01:14:54.436
Bob Perry, referee.

01:14:54.506 --> 01:14:55.768
Let's go!

01:15:06.351 --> 01:15:08.751
Take your time, boy.
Let him fight himself out.

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:09.912
I'll tell you when to commence.

01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:40.769
- Keep it coming up, Andy!
- Up!

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.279
Keep that left up, Andy.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:02.064
You're going swell, Andy.
Keep it up and the fight's yours.

01:17:02.134 --> 01:17:04.102
I've given him everything that I've got.

01:17:04.169 --> 01:17:05.602
You've got plenty left, Andy.

01:17:05.671 --> 01:17:08.071
He hit me a couple of
terrible wallops here.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.164
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:09.241 --> 01:17:11.539
What did you say, Champ?
What's the matter?

01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:14.443
Everything's okay. Everything will be okay.

01:17:16.415 --> 01:17:19.475
Now is the time, let him have it.
Don't give him an inch.

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:21.348
Let him have it quick.

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:24.249
I don't think he can take them
in the middle.

01:17:24.323 --> 01:17:25.381
Keep working on that stomach now.

01:17:25.457 --> 01:17:26.924
Tear in. Let him have it from both sides.

01:17:26.992 --> 01:17:29.017
Go to it, boy. Stay with him now.

01:17:46.278 --> 01:17:47.267
Nice doing, Andy!

01:17:57.155 --> 01:17:58.281
...three...

01:17:58.357 --> 01:18:01.019
four, five, six...

01:18:16.341 --> 01:18:18.605
One, two, three...

01:18:18.844 --> 01:18:21.779
four, five, six, seven...

01:18:30.822 --> 01:18:33.256
Go on, save yourself. That's the stuff!

01:18:33.325 --> 01:18:35.520
Hang on, Andy, save yourself!

01:18:39.197 --> 01:18:40.926
One, two...

01:18:40.999 --> 01:18:42.591
three...

01:18:42.734 --> 01:18:44.895
four, five...

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.335
- six...
- Ring that bell!

01:18:46.405 --> 01:18:48.930
...seven, eight, nine...
- Ring that bell!

01:19:01.753 --> 01:19:04.347
You're doing fine, Manuel.
You nearly knocked him out.

01:19:04.423 --> 01:19:07.221
The bell saved him.
It's all right, take your time.

01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:09.021
Give me that smelling salts.

01:19:09.094 --> 01:19:10.618
Hey, here's the water.

01:19:10.695 --> 01:19:12.560
Frankie, is he hurt?

01:19:12.697 --> 01:19:15.188
Is he unconscious?

01:19:19.538 --> 01:19:20.664
I'm all right.

01:19:20.739 --> 01:19:23.435
What's the use, Andy?
What's the use of going on?

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:26.341
- Let's quit, will you?
- No! I can whip him.

01:19:26.411 --> 01:19:28.675
The odds are too big, Andy.
You can't buck him, boy!

01:19:28.747 --> 01:19:30.146
No! I can whip him!

01:19:30.215 --> 01:19:33.878
Daddy, I'm scared what he's doing to you,
that's all.

01:19:33.952 --> 01:19:35.317
- No.
- I don't want you to go in.

01:19:35.387 --> 01:19:37.150
I'm all right, Dink.

01:19:37.622 --> 01:19:40.523
- I'm gonna throw this towel in.
- No, don't! No!

01:19:40.792 --> 01:19:41.781
Don't.

01:19:43.595 --> 01:19:45.392
I'm surprised at you.

01:19:49.267 --> 01:19:50.962
Don't, Champ, please!

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:53.004
- Here.
- Come on, Tim, get him out of here.

01:19:53.071 --> 01:19:54.834
Spit on that for luck.

01:19:54.906 --> 01:19:57.340
Go on, please, spit on it for luck.

01:19:57.576 --> 01:20:00.204
Come on, spit on it, Dink. Please.

01:20:00.278 --> 01:20:03.179
Just for luck. Shoot the works.
That's right.

01:20:33.211 --> 01:20:35.236
- Andy! To your neutral corner!
- One, two...

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.369
- He's down!
...three, four...

01:20:36.448 --> 01:20:38.177
They're counting him out!
Get in the corner!

01:20:38.283 --> 01:20:40.911
...five, six, seven...

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.416
eight, nine, ten.

01:20:44.589 --> 01:20:45.783
Out!

01:21:24.596 --> 01:21:27.963
Well! I better go easy, huh?
Not as good as I used to be?

01:21:28.033 --> 01:21:29.762
Great fight, Andy. I'm proud of you, boy.

01:21:29.834 --> 01:21:31.563
Thank you. Thank you.

01:21:33.171 --> 01:21:35.662
- Have you got the horse?
- Sure, take a look.

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.230
- Right over there.
- Yeah.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:40.142
- Dinkus, look at that.
- Little Champ!

01:21:40.211 --> 01:21:42.543
Yeah, he's yours this time for keeps.

01:21:42.614 --> 01:21:44.639
- Go and get him.
- Hooray! Whoopee!

01:21:44.716 --> 01:21:47.549
Hello there, Little Champ, how are you?

01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:50.485
Gee, I ain't seen you in such a long time.

01:21:52.691 --> 01:21:54.750
Gee, I'm glad I got that horse.

01:21:55.493 --> 01:21:57.154
I am, too, Andy.

01:22:03.268 --> 01:22:06.362
Come on, let's go.
Let's get in that dressing room.

01:22:06.438 --> 01:22:08.065
All right, Champ.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:14.539
- Champ! What's the matter?
- Andy!

01:22:14.613 --> 01:22:16.843
Frankie, get the doctor. Quick!

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.157
- What's the matter, old boy?
- Andy?

01:22:26.858 --> 01:22:30.589
Where is he? Frankie.
Doc, he flopped outside.

01:22:34.899 --> 01:22:36.594
What's the matter?

01:22:46.911 --> 01:22:48.344
What's happened?

01:22:49.114 --> 01:22:50.638
Nothing, Dink.

01:22:51.616 --> 01:22:54.676
All of a sudden I turn sissy...

01:22:54.753 --> 01:22:56.618
and faint dead away.

01:22:57.022 --> 01:22:58.819
The ground came up...

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:01.654
and socked me right square in the face.

01:23:03.595 --> 01:23:06.462
I won the fight, didn't I, Dink?

01:23:07.632 --> 01:23:09.224
I'll say you did.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.825
Ain't you proud of your old man now?

01:23:12.337 --> 01:23:14.999
Gee, Champ, I always was.

01:23:16.007 --> 01:23:18.908
And you was going to throw
that towel in...

01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:20.739
and stop the fight.

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:23.343
Ain't you ashamed of yourself?

01:23:26.284 --> 01:23:27.478
Champ.

01:23:28.219 --> 01:23:29.413
Champ!

01:23:30.889 --> 01:23:32.254
Nix, Dink.

01:23:33.358 --> 01:23:35.019
Keep your chin up.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.025
Don't cry.

01:23:37.862 --> 01:23:39.124
Come on.

01:23:39.297 --> 01:23:41.356
Give the old man a smile.

01:23:44.636 --> 01:23:45.864
Keep it...

01:23:46.204 --> 01:23:47.262
Champ!

01:23:47.338 --> 01:23:49.738
Champ, open your eyes!

01:23:50.408 --> 01:23:51.739
Look at me!

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:53.437
Champ! Champ!

01:23:57.082 --> 01:24:00.245
It's little Dink talking.
Please open your eyes.

01:24:01.086 --> 01:24:02.610
Look at me.

01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:06.288
Doctor, what's the matter?
What's the matter with him?

01:24:06.357 --> 01:24:09.656
Come on now, Dink.
You've got to be brave, son.

01:24:10.495 --> 01:24:12.895
Why is the Champ acting that way?

01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:15.694
He never has before.
Why doesn't he talk to me?

01:24:15.767 --> 01:24:19.100
Well, but the Champ
is just tired, you understand.

01:24:19.571 --> 01:24:21.766
No, it ain't so.

01:24:22.006 --> 01:24:23.530
Oh, God!

01:24:28.513 --> 01:24:30.310
I want the Champ!

01:24:30.949 --> 01:24:33.179
I want the Champ!

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.511
I want the Champ!

01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:40.482
Tim understands.

01:24:41.192 --> 01:24:43.126
Champ's gone on a trip.

01:24:43.461 --> 01:24:45.929
No! Go away! Let me go!

01:24:46.364 --> 01:24:48.889
I want the Champ! The Champ!

01:24:48.967 --> 01:24:51.060
Steady, Dink. I'm your pal.

01:24:54.072 --> 01:24:56.939
I want the Champ! I want the Champ!

01:24:57.175 --> 01:25:01.009
Don't worry, Dink.
We'll have a lot of fun from now on.

01:25:02.046 --> 01:25:04.344
Oh, that's all right.

01:25:07.752 --> 01:25:09.583
I want the Champ!

01:25:09.654 --> 01:25:11.417
Dink, be a brave little boy, will you?

01:25:11.489 --> 01:25:12.922
Be a brave boy.

01:25:13.591 --> 01:25:14.615
Okay.

01:25:15.627 --> 01:25:17.492
But I want the Champ!

01:25:17.562 --> 01:25:19.928
Dink, everything will be all right, Dink.

01:25:20.298 --> 01:25:21.731
Oh, Tony, yeah.

01:25:22.333 --> 01:25:24.096
But you... Oh, go away!

01:25:24.936 --> 01:25:26.801
Go on! I want the Champ!

01:25:26.871 --> 01:25:29.772
I want the Champ! I want the Champ!

01:25:34.512 --> 01:25:35.843
Mother?

01:25:36.948 --> 01:25:38.677
- Mother.
- Yes, dear.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.417
My baby.

01:25:44.088 --> 01:25:46.056
The Champ is dead, Mama.

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:47.380
There, there.

01:25:50.261 --> 01:25:51.592
Oh, sweetie...

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:55.192
you'll be all right, darling.
