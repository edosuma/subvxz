blessed little town has lacked?

01:14.942 --> 01:16.375
A human zoo?

01:16.377 --> 01:18.444
What we lack is a town anthem.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.946
And you're in luck,
because I have written one.

you have to listen!

11:38.732 --> 11:41.900
That place you sent me to
changed my life.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.168
Thank you, Lord!

11:43.170 --> 11:45.570
And I'll give up
online scrapbooking,

11:45.572 --> 11:47.038
like I promised.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.375
They taught me that I don't
need to lose weight.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.544
I should just be proud
of what I am.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.812
What?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.580
Restore, restore!

11:55.582 --> 11:57.582
(buzzer sounds)

11:57.584 --> 11:58.983
I met a guy...

11:58.985 --> 12:00.652
a wonderful guy...

12:00.654 --> 12:02.153
Oh, Lord.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.488
It's not what
you think.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.756
His name is Albert,

12:04.758 --> 12:07.225
and he taught me
not to buy into the lies

12:07.227 --> 12:09.094
taught by Big Nutrition.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.229
That's worse than
what I thought.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.733
Marge, you're my wife
of ten years and I love you,

12:14.735 --> 12:17.869
but I must observe
the teachings of this man

12:17.871 --> 12:19.571
I just met tonight.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.507
Now, the first thing
I have to do is make amends.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.342
With the bathroom scale.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.112
I'm so sorry
I threw you across the room

12:27.114 --> 12:28.747
and called you a liar.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.583
When you told me
I was 260 pounds,

12:31.585 --> 12:33.752
you were just encouraging me.

12:33.754 --> 12:37.055
It was a poem you were writing
about my potential.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.424
I'm gonna start celebrating
my size,

12:39.426 --> 12:41.860
and I need you with me
as a partner.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.228
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:43.230 --> 12:45.864
I need to talk
to the broken porch swing.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.565
HOMER:
<i>So, from now on,</i>

12:47.567 --> 12:50.368
<i>you guys can no longer say</i>
<i>these hateful words:</i>

12:50.370 --> 12:52.604

13:30.010 --> 13:31.843
What about
Mr. Two Belts?

13:31.845 --> 13:33.011
Good, good!

13:33.013 --> 13:35.280
By which I mean,
"Bad, bad!"

13:35.282 --> 13:37.081
You know, as long as
we're opening this up--

13:37.083 --> 13:38.783
and I'm glad you are--

13:38.785 --> 13:41.152
I want to tell you guys that
when you call me a gargoyle,

13:41.154 --> 13:44.989
a troll or a homunculus,
it kind of hurts my feelings.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.424
What? You're kidding.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.692
We never dreamed.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.627
Who knew goblins
had feelings?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.462
You see? That's what
I'm talking about. Because...

13:51.464 --> 13:53.531
CROWD (chanting):
We're big! We're proud!

13:53.533 --> 13:55.533
Two of us can make a crowd!

13:55.535 --> 13:58.837
Sorry, fellas. There's
a movement I have to join.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.373
I've learned there's something
more important than drinking:

14:02.375 --> 14:04.209
eating.

14:04.211 --> 14:08.046
Thank you for the
easy financing!

14:08.048 --> 14:09.781
What the...?!

14:09.783 --> 14:12.884
Your store is forcing
unattainable body images

14:12.886 --> 14:14.219
on our young people.

14:14.221 --> 14:17.388
I say, end the thinsanity!

14:17.390 --> 14:19.324
You, my friend, are wrong.

14:19.326 --> 14:23.394
Every girl should look like
a sexy praying mantis from Milan

14:23.396 --> 14:24.896
whose hips are narrower

14:24.898 --> 14:27.565
than an Italian
parliamentary majority.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.900
Whew.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.135
(siren whoops)

14:31.137 --> 14:32.871
Okay, people,
show's over.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.339
Nothing to
eat here.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.573
Now move along.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.975
If you can.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.177
If not, we're gonna
have to take you in.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.079
Clancy, what are you doing?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.347
You're one of us!

14:42.349 --> 14:43.848
You're right.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.050
Take me in, Lou.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.652
Ow, ah.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.853
(grunting)

14:48.855 --> 14:49.921
Hey! Why?

14:49.923 --> 14:52.323
Ah, geez, Lou.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.825
You seem to be enjoying this.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.693
Just doing
my job, Chief.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.895
(Taser crackles)

14:56.897 --> 14:58.263
Oh, that's some nice
Tase work, Lou.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.498
(grunting)

15:02.701 --> 15:04.002
Homer Simpson?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.203
HOMER:
Right here!

15:05.205 --> 15:06.771
Excuse me. Pardon me.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.339
Coming through.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.841
Coming back. Excuse me.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.175
Pardon me. There we go.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.410
Uh, coming up.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.611
What can I do for you?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.146
You're free
on bail.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.917
People, give thanks
to that woman,

15:18.919 --> 15:22.387
standing up for all of us,
even though she's a lighty.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.621
Thank you.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.390
Although, I think
the worst thing

15:25.392 --> 15:28.559
that ever happened to my husband
was joining your group.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.627
(crowd gasps, murmurs)

15:29.629 --> 15:30.595
(clears throat)

15:30.597 --> 15:32.196
I'll handle this.

15:32.198 --> 15:35.366
What is the point of a long life
if it's not enjoyed?

15:35.368 --> 15:36.601
(drooling moan)

15:36.603 --> 15:38.436
Homer, you have to choose.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.172
And I think
the choice is clear.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.983
Guys, I'm coming
back in!

15:51.985 --> 15:53.451
Suck in your guts.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.720
(all inhaling)

15:55.722 --> 15:58.089
(sighs) Home.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.357
(groans)

16:06.065 --> 16:07.498
(laughing)

16:07.500 --> 16:10.101
Whee! Whee!

16:10.103 --> 16:12.503
Who's he giving
a piggyback ride to?

16:12.505 --> 16:13.805
We don't know.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.807
Mom, what's wrong?

16:15.809 --> 16:17.342
How come Dad's
not with you?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.677
Are they setting bail
by the pound? (laughs)

16:19.679 --> 16:23.481
He chose to spend the night
in a jail with strangers

16:23.483 --> 16:24.749
instead of me.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.150
Mom, Lisa and I learned

16:26.152 --> 16:28.820
that we can solve any problem
through song.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.123
Lisa, let's go write something
that'll change Dad's mind.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.358
Do you really think

16:33.360 --> 16:35.159
that we can write a song
that does that?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.928
I just wanted to get
out of the room.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.097
She was really
bumming me out.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.201
Ah, geez.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.969
I thought writing another
hit song would be easier.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.337
Well, it
would've helped

16:46.339 --> 16:47.972
if you hadn't crumpled
up all the paper

16:47.974 --> 16:50.842
before we wrote
anything on it.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.210
No more judgment!

16:52.212 --> 16:53.544
No more jokes!

16:53.546 --> 16:56.280
We will not be made
to feel less than

16:56.282 --> 16:59.350
because we are greater than!

16:59.352 --> 17:01.686
I was distinctly
promised no math!

17:01.688 --> 17:05.723
Homer, I want to say something
extremely important

17:05.725 --> 17:08.893
the way a woman does--
subtly, through someone else.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.128
Kids...

17:10.130 --> 17:12.730
♪

17:12.732 --> 17:14.699
Take it, Bart!
You take it!

17:14.701 --> 17:16.067
I gave it to you!

17:16.069 --> 17:17.368
I refuse
to accept it!

17:17.370 --> 17:19.037
LENNY:
Just start the song!

17:19.039 --> 17:20.371
We couldn't write a song.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.906
We're one-hit wonders.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.374
But is that such a crime?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.909
Look at J.D. Salinger.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.210
<i>Franny and Zooey.</i>

17:26.212 --> 17:27.378
Rubik's Cube!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.546
Rubik's Snake!

17:28.548 --> 17:30.648
Charles M. Schulz.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.849
You've got me there.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.317
It's her fault.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.986
She was sucking all the gangsta
out of everything.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.721
Well, you're the only
"gangsta" I know

17:36.723 --> 17:38.389
with a 9:00 bedtime.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.992
9:30, starting in summer.
Mom said.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.860
Ah, kids,
stop arguing.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.729
Or keep arguing.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.364
I don't care.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.400
Homer, I'm sorry I tried
to help you control your weight.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.903
(sighs) I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.005
Sorry I ever
opened my mouth.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.773
Marge, it's not
your fault

17:55.775 --> 17:59.077
that you can't win against
a superior being like Albert.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.578
(slurps)

18:01.380 --> 18:02.513
Mmm.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.948
But, Marge, I
don't want you

18:03.950 --> 18:05.583
to ever stop
caring about me.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.918
How can you
follow a leader

18:06.920 --> 18:08.719
who won't even get
up out of his chair?

18:08.721 --> 18:10.421
Marge, I believe
you're forgetting

18:10.423 --> 18:14.225
America's greatest wartime
wheelchair-bound leader:

18:14.227 --> 18:16.594
Professor X
of the X-Men.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.297
It's not that Professor X
wouldn't get up,

18:19.299 --> 18:20.731
it's that he couldn't!

18:20.733 --> 18:23.634
Well, I'll show you
who can get up!

18:23.636 --> 18:26.204
(triumphant music playing)

18:28.640 --> 18:31.509
(footsteps thudding heavily)

18:33.212 --> 18:35.446
(roars)

18:35.448 --> 18:36.614
That's right!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.282
I don't need
this scooter!

18:38.284 --> 18:39.550
All of you,

18:39.552 --> 18:42.220
follow me to the future!

18:42.222 --> 18:44.055
(groans)

18:45.324 --> 18:46.924
Oh, dear God.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.160
Stick a forklift
in him, he's dead.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.728
(laughs)

18:51.930 --> 18:54.165
(organ playing solemn music)

19:06.778 --> 19:08.679
I've never written
a eulogy before,

19:08.681 --> 19:10.615
but this time, I did.

19:10.617 --> 19:14.318
Unfortunately,
I left it at home.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.020
Thanks, lady.

19:16.022 --> 19:19.624
What Albert taught us
is that all people have pride

19:19.626 --> 19:22.660
and no group should ever
be insulted.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.128
He knew what
was important

19:24.130 --> 19:27.098
was how you lived
your life every day.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.767
Till he was taken
from us too soon,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.802
at the age of...

19:31.804 --> 19:33.004
(whispering)

19:33.006 --> 19:34.338
Twenty-three?!

19:34.340 --> 19:37.008
People, for God's sake,
join a gym!

19:37.010 --> 19:38.509
(crowd murmuring)

19:38.511 --> 19:41.512
Kumiko, would you still love me
if I lost weight?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.514
Much more!
(sighs)

19:43.516 --> 19:45.950
Marge, I'm sorry
I was proud of myself.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.485
That's not really what I was...

19:47.487 --> 19:49.320
It will never
happen again!

19:49.322 --> 19:51.722
Now come on.
Let's walk home.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.624
Absolutely.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.159
Can I ask you
something?

19:55.161 --> 19:57.395
What is it that
keeps you with me?

19:57.397 --> 20:00.231
It's because
everything you love,

20:00.233 --> 20:02.567
you love so much.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.068
Because you love me,

20:04.070 --> 20:07.538
I will not stop yo-yo dieting
till I get it right.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.940
Oh...

20:26.425 --> 20:27.825
At last.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.193
Well done, Dad.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.996
You finally reached
emotional maturity.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.497
Unlike Bart.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.233
Bart's very mature.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.335
Take it from the little
boy in his tummy.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.037
Now, when do I get
to be the head again?

20:40.039 --> 20:42.073
Soon.
It's always "soon."

20:42.075 --> 20:44.342

Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

20:50.415 --> 20:52.350
Whoa!

20:52.352 --> 20:53.951
(horse neighs)

20:53.953 --> 20:57.755
Oh. I wish I had
said that earlier.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.869
Shh!
