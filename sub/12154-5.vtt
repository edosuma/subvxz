01:11.528 --> 01:15.637
- Do you love books?
- Oh my God!

01:15.700 --> 01:16.827
Sorry.

01:17.799 --> 01:19.559
Are you... Dmitry?

01:19.848 --> 01:22.222
- That's not the code.
- Sorry.

01:23.421 --> 01:26.532
- I love books and books love me.
- Better.

01:26.895 --> 01:28.686
- I'm Dmitry.
- Jonathan Ames.

01:28.687 --> 01:29.374
- I know.

01:29.831 --> 01:33.337
Thank you for suggesting that i bring Gogol's "The Nose".

01:33.338 --> 01:38.021
In addition to being a private detective I'm also 
doing some writing on the side.

01:38.188 --> 01:40.973
- I always loved novels.
- Me too.

01:40.974 --> 01:46.537
Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Gogol,
these were my soulmates in prison.

01:46.515 --> 01:49.040
- They kept me alive for three years.
- Prison?

01:49.340 --> 01:50.772
You... Why were you in prison?

01:50.773 --> 01:53.801
It's not important. Let's sit and talk.

02:05.232 --> 02:07.254
I need you to find a woman.

02:07.255 --> 02:10.264
That's my specialty.
I found several.

02:10.258 --> 02:14.611
Good. She is the great love of my life.
She is all I thought about in prison.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.644
How long were you with her?

02:16.645 --> 02:18.228
One night.

02:18.229 --> 02:19.880
Just one night?

02:19.903 --> 02:23.369
Oh, one night, if the love is perfect,
is all you need.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.211
Also, I was arrested the next day.

02:26.212 --> 02:30.859
We met in Brighton Beach.
Very romantic.

02:31.087 --> 02:32.446
- Have you ever been there?
- No.

02:32.447 --> 02:36.083
My girlfriend Suzanne always wanted
to go to those nightclubs out there,

02:36.468 --> 02:38.304
We never did, and
then she broke up with me.

02:38.748 --> 02:41.585
Oh, well of course, because you
don't take here where she wants to go

02:42.330 --> 02:46.189
So, what did you offer her to stay?
Diamonds, gold, car with sunroof?

02:46.190 --> 02:47.771
No, I just... um...

02:47.772 --> 02:52.117
- begged... And I...
- Cried?

02:52.920 --> 02:53.701
A little.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.631
Good. It's natural.
But also

02:57.632 --> 02:59.613
if you want to keep a woman
you have to be strong.

03:00.027 --> 03:03.909
Women need us to be
commanding and decisive.

03:04.104 --> 03:08.959
- But do they? I don't know, maybe they do...
- They do.

03:09.671 --> 03:14.019
So, my woman...
I don't know her real name.

03:14.636 --> 03:19.523
Only her stage name.
Irina, The Lonely White Dove.

03:20.430 --> 03:24.367
She was singer at cafe "Tatiana".
I want you to go there.

03:24.368 --> 03:26.439
I'm happy to go to this club for you, but...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.787
why don't you just go there
to save you my fee?

03:28.788 --> 03:33.821
My parole officer won't let me out at night.
That's why I found you on Craigslist.

03:34.134 --> 03:38.754
Also, I got apartment, exercise bicycle,
and you, my own private detective.

03:38.948 --> 03:41.899
I'm your man then.
I'll go to Tatiana.

03:41.900 --> 03:47.240
Spasibo!
Please, find my woman.

03:58.203 --> 04:01.304
Do you think I lost Suzanne
because I didn't take her to places?

04:01.579 --> 04:03.963
Or you think I lost her
because I was indecisive?

04:05.349 --> 04:09.535
Probably both. But I can't think
about your failed relationship right now.

04:09.597 --> 04:12.909
I have to tell you,
I'm in a bad way, Jonathan.

04:13.262 --> 04:16.462
- Why, what's going on?
- The magazine's numbers are way down.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.402
Newsstands, subscriptions, advertising,
it's very bleak.

04:20.403 --> 04:22.755
- And it's all my fault.
- It's not your fault.

04:22.984 --> 04:26.284
- All magazines are dying.
- Yes, yes. But a few will survive.

04:26.285 --> 04:30.814
It's Darwinian, see? We need to adapt,
I... I need to adapt.

04:30.815 --> 04:33.933
Our biggest problem is our female demographic.

04:33.934 --> 04:39.199
- We've lost over 37% of our women readers.
- That is a lot of women.

04:39.200 --> 04:43.174
- I know.
- So, what's the plan, hire more women writers?

04:43.259 --> 04:45.751
That's a good idea actually.

04:45.752 --> 04:50.062
That'd be the second step.
First step though is to change me.

04:50.605 --> 04:54.877
- See, if I'm right, the magazine will be right.
- But how are you gonna change?

04:55.068 --> 04:59.195
You told me once that after the age of 55
it's impossible to change.

04:59.196 --> 05:02.768
That's why my therapist is suggesting something radical.

05:02.769 --> 05:06.357
- He wants me to experiment with bisexuality.
- What?

05:06.725 --> 05:10.707
- Mister Christopher, I need to clean in here.
- Yes, of course, yes, of course.

05:10.708 --> 05:12.797
Um... Sorry. Uh...

05:18.934 --> 05:24.859
He says it'll help me appeal to women readers,
you know, put me in touch with my feminine side.

05:24.860 --> 05:27.892
- Your therapist sounds crazy.
- I know, I know, but...

05:27.893 --> 05:30.597
most therapists are.
That's what gives them insight.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.438
- This is insane.
- Well, what can I say, Jonathan, 

05:33.439 --> 05:35.822
I am desperate to help the magazine.

05:35.854 --> 05:39.190
- I'm willing to try anything.
- But if you experiment with bisexuality,

05:39.191 --> 05:41.772
you'll just be more gay,
not necessarily more feminine.

05:41.831 --> 05:45.236
That's fine!
I mean, who designs women's clothing?

05:45.215 --> 05:47.954
Gay men.
Who do women find attractive?

05:48.045 --> 05:48.885
Gay men.

05:48.886 --> 05:51.960
Who writes women's TV shows?
Gay men.

05:54.347 --> 05:56.268
I really think it's my only choice.

05:56.287 --> 06:01.261
- But have you ever experimented before?
- No. But I do have an open mind about the whole thing.

06:01.271 --> 06:05.254
You know, Laurence Olivier and Danny Kaye
were lovers.

06:05.537 --> 06:06.582
- Really?
- Um-hmm.

06:06.583 --> 06:13.758
Yeah, ?????  ????? my favorite actors of all time.
I mean they were like two sides of this strange coin.

06:13.759 --> 06:19.101
Hamlet and the court jester.
The Dark Prince and the Technicolor Clown.

06:19.102 --> 06:22.847
- I mean, it's amazing.
- It's hard to imagine them as lovers.

06:24.432 --> 06:29.106
It's hard to put this in such old-fashioned terms, but
who do you think played the woman in their relationship?

06:29.107 --> 06:32.092
Danny Kaye.
I mean, he could do a lot of accents.

06:32.577 --> 06:35.568
That way Olivier could have
a different woman every night.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.804
I'll have a white wine.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.504
I was wondering if you could help me.

07:16.895 --> 07:20.448
I'm looking for a singer Irina,
The Lonely White Dove?

07:34.085 --> 07:39.662
I dont know if you gentelmen heard my question,
but, er, I'm looking for Irina, The Lonely White Dove.

07:40.307 --> 07:44.081
- You're a tourist?
- No. No, not exactly, I... live in Brooklyn.

07:44.082 --> 07:47.040
Then come, sit down.
Have a good Russian meal.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.676
Vodka, caviar, blini, syomga.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.181
Excuse me,
who is that beautiful singer?

08:07.332 --> 08:11.184
Oh, that is Bascha(?)
You have no chance, she's not interested in penis.

08:11.185 --> 08:14.710
- She's a Sapho.
- Oh, I'm not... I didn't mean it...

08:15.216 --> 08:18.960
D'you know... is there a singer here
named Irina, The Lonely White Dove?

08:19.277 --> 08:20.844
Her old boyfriend's looking for her.

08:21.149 --> 08:25.020
We don't have The Lonely Dove, we have
The Lonely Sparrow, she sings tomorrow.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.189
Great, thank you!

08:29.054 --> 08:30.481
Oh... thank you.

08:33.385 --> 08:35.374
Na zdoroviya!

08:43.352 --> 08:45.489
Is vodka really made from potatoes?

09:18.214 --> 09:22.201
Uuuh... I'm really hangover from that vodka.

09:22.202 --> 09:25.113
Well, you gotta write something.
I do my best work hungover.

09:25.460 --> 09:28.022
I've less brain cells to confuse the issue.

09:28.023 --> 09:32.896
Did this yesterday morning
right after I barfed all over the place.

09:33.863 --> 09:39.255
- You're not that big.
- In my mind, I am. Huge, but underused.

09:39.526 --> 09:40.566
What are you drawing this for?

09:40.683 --> 09:45.195
It's a story about being a sperm donor to Lisa and Michelle,
and how Leah won't sleep with me.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.038
This editor at Esquire is really into it, so...

09:48.402 --> 09:52.749
Really great work.
It... uhh... sorry, I feel so sick.

09:53.216 --> 09:54.594
Let's go get a drink right now.

09:54.836 --> 09:59.202
Oh, quit kidding around, I gotta drink more tonight,
going back to that club.

09:59.862 --> 10:03.110
I'm supposed to find out if
The Lonely Sparrow is Irina.

10:03.711 --> 10:06.201
Actually i'd a really fun time there last night.

10:07.348 --> 10:09.789
Can't believe I never took Suzanne
to Brighton Beach.

10:09.790 --> 10:11.333
Why don't you take Suzanne tonight?

10:12.334 --> 10:16.358
You know, you guys have ??? breakup sex rights
for the couple of months?

10:16.935 --> 10:17.755
You do.

10:19.220 --> 10:20.038
Maybe you're right.

10:20.503 --> 10:22.850
Well, if you do call her, maybe Leah 
and I can go with you tonight,

10:22.851 --> 10:24.738
 we're supposed to work on our intimacy issues.

10:24.739 --> 10:27.401
But if the four of us go, that's not very intimate.

10:27.402 --> 10:32.113
Yeah, but if you go, we won't fight,
and that's really good for intimacy.

10:38.119 --> 10:39.872
Mi vida loca.

10:49.019 --> 10:49.616
Hello?

10:49.835 --> 10:53.963
- Suzanne, it's Jonathan.
- I know. What's going on?

10:54.622 --> 11:00.300
First of all, I just wanna say I'm really sorry about what
happened the last time I saw you with your Al-Anon friend.

11:00.582 --> 11:03.899
- Let's not talk about it.
- Well, I wanna make it up to you.

11:04.086 --> 11:08.098
You know how we never went to Brighton beach
because I thought it was too long of a subway ride?

11:08.099 --> 11:11.693
Well, you and I are going out there tonight.

11:11.694 --> 11:18.113
That's right, um, I... I found this great place,
late dinner, drinks, dancing...

11:18.114 --> 11:20.622
- You know I dont' wanna see you drinking.
- I was talking about water.

11:20.623 --> 11:24.207
We'll drink water after we dance, to rehydrate.

11:24.550 --> 11:29.926
- What is this about?
- Nothing. I'm just feeling really... decisive.

11:30.264 --> 11:34.505
You know, I want you to have the
Brighton Beach night I never gave you.

11:34.506 --> 11:37.170
I don't think we should be going on a date, Jonathan.

11:37.171 --> 11:41.117
- It's not a date, it's platonic.
- Dancing is platonic?

11:41.118 --> 11:46.076
Yes, dancing is platonic. We'll stay 3 feet
from each other the whole night, I promise.

11:46.077 --> 11:52.371
And... and  it's going to be lots of people there,
Ray and Leah, ????..., lots of people.

11:52.524 --> 11:55.958
Well... I guess I did always want to go.

11:55.959 --> 12:02.717
We don't even have to sit next to each other, I'll sit across
the room the whole night sending you platonic love notes.

12:03.162 --> 12:05.436
What's a platonic love note?

12:08.335 --> 12:10.606
I just thought it was gonna be you and me.

12:10.977 --> 12:14.506
Well, Jonathan knew where this place was, and
it just seemed to me easier if we all came together.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.288
Plus, he's split the car service with me, so...

12:17.289 --> 12:21.423
Well, if it meant being alone,
I could've paid for the car.

12:21.424 --> 12:24.808
Well, tonight is on me...
and Jonathan. Oh, good.

12:27.786 --> 12:31.076
A little bit of... potato sauce.

12:40.208 --> 12:43.499
- What're you doing?
- I'm zapping it, like Ice-Man...

12:43.500 --> 12:46.923
From the X-Men series.
Remember when I drew them for Marvel?

12:46.924 --> 12:54.766
- Ray, can we please not talk about comics for one night?
- Ok. To the prettiest girl in Brighton Beach.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.350
That's better.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.781
- Hi Leah, hey Ray.
- He-ey, want some vodka?

13:05.851 --> 13:08.562
Okay.
I thought there will be more people here.

13:08.780 --> 13:10.252
I thought there'll be less.

13:10.253 --> 13:15.561
Well, we don't know these people yet, but you'll see,
pretty soon this place is gonna be like a big Russian wedding.

13:15.821 --> 13:17.730
By the end we're all gonna know
each other pretty well.

13:17.731 --> 13:22.384
Well, un-limited vodka here, this
is where the value is.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.007
To the drug czar.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.503
- Cheers.
- Cin-cin.

13:31.165 --> 13:33.245
I thought you said you weren't drinking tonight.

13:33.910 --> 13:39.677
Oh... oh... well, it was just... er... celebratory
toast, you know, er... ???? Moscow!

13:40.326 --> 13:44.208
Er... I'll switch to water now.
So... To water!

13:44.791 --> 13:45.427
To water!

13:50.276 --> 13:51.001
Oh, this is good.

13:51.771 --> 13:54.393
- Let's all dance!
- That's a good idea.

13:54.394 --> 13:58.762
- No, my toes are all fused. My toes are all fused.
- Come on, don't be a baby.

14:01.198 --> 14:02.849
It's been a while since we danced together.

14:12.676 --> 14:18.989
I know I said we would only dance 3 feet apart, but...
is 2 feet okay?

14:20.282 --> 14:22.654
Yeah, I think it's... 2 feet's okay.

14:23.982 --> 14:27.132
- This is fun!
- Yeah. It really is.

14:29.597 --> 14:30.889
You can come closer if you want.

14:33.260 --> 14:34.475
Really?

14:44.280 --> 14:52.308
Everyone, please, sit down!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage...

14:53.350 --> 14:57.243
Nadia, The Lonely Sparrow!

15:26.508 --> 15:30.097
I think that's the woman I'm looking for.
She is beautiful.

15:31.238 --> 15:34.532
What are you guys talking about?
Do you know her?

15:34.533 --> 15:40.007
No. No, not at all... Not yet, but...
It's c-c... it's complicated.

15:42.386 --> 15:45.588
Aw, shit... It's George, I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

15:45.589 --> 15:51.012
But... you're having fun here, right?
I mean, we're in Brighton Beach...

15:51.935 --> 15:52.663
I'm sorry...

15:54.523 --> 15:55.849
Hello, George?

15:55.850 --> 15:58.226
Uh... wait, hold on, it's loud here.

16:01.488 --> 16:05.518
- Sorry, George, what's up?
- What if I do this, and I don't come back?

16:05.519 --> 16:09.263
- What do you mean?
- Th... That I'd turn completely gay.

16:09.666 --> 16:18.106
- Well... Then it was meant to be.
- You know what? You're absolutely right.

16:18.497 --> 16:21.756
I have to remember that it helped Jon Wiener's(?) carrier.

16:21.757 --> 16:26.305
I mean, all of his magazines thrived after he
became homosexual. Really boosted sales.

16:26.306 --> 16:34.976
Thank you! Okay, um, so...
D'you know how I could find a male escort?

16:34.977 --> 16:38.120
- No, I don't know!
- ... the reception's bad here. What...

16:38.121 --> 16:41.862
- I don't know how to find a male escort.
- Well, you should know these things.

16:41.863 --> 16:45.709
No, I shouldn't!
Look, just google "male escort new york city".

16:45.710 --> 16:49.697
Wait, I can't hear you. The reception is terrible, is it me or you?

16:49.698 --> 16:59.036
Just google "male escort new york city".
Actually, google "gay male escort new york city"...

16:59.932 --> 17:02.722
George, I gotta go.
I'm in a Russian night club.

17:02.723 --> 17:05.909
A Russian night club?
Oh, hey, I wanna go!

17:07.115 --> 17:10.626
Sorry about that, um...
friend... just never mind, um...

17:11.213 --> 17:18.816
You guys work here, right? Can you tell me,  did Nadia The
Lonely Sparrow used to be Irena, The Lonely White Dove?

17:18.817 --> 17:22.733
Why you wanna know so much?
Last night you told waitress 

17:22.734 --> 17:26.276
a boyfriend is looking for The Lonely Dove.

17:26.942 --> 17:29.443
Who's the boyfriend, hm?
Who do you work for?

17:29.444 --> 17:31.956
Nobody!
Look, let's just forget it, okay?

17:32.215 --> 17:35.791
I... I've forgotten it, um... so I'm just gonna go back inside...

17:35.792 --> 17:39.198
- Oh, you are a fool.
- Hey, hey, ow, don't touch me!

17:39.199 --> 17:44.555
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Look, my friends are inside,
okay, I've already paid for to meals, 38 dollars...

17:44.556 --> 17:47.725
- Don't ever come in here again.
- What? What about my friends?

17:47.726 --> 17:50.419
- Fuck friends!
- Hey, come on, get your hands up!

17:52.375 --> 17:54.871
If we see you here again,
we will break you!

18:01.491 --> 18:04.185
Shit!
Shit!

18:06.452 --> 18:12.255
You... You work for Dmitry?
He's... He's my friend. She wants you to call her.

18:13.452 --> 18:17.756
The girl! The singer, Irina!
Call her tomorrow, uhuh?

18:18.495 --> 18:20.691
- Who are you?
- I cannot talk to you, it's not safe for me.

18:21.303 --> 18:24.739
Wait, can you help me get back in there?
My girlfriend's in there!

18:33.738 --> 18:34.554
Ray?

18:37.816 --> 18:43.470
I say in the ad that I'm an unlicensed private detective.
Which makes it more legal. Sort of.

18:43.471 --> 18:46.226
Anyway, the guy that I'm working for is an ex-con.

18:46.791 --> 18:49.344
But he's a real romantic, and I'm trying to help him.

18:52.929 --> 18:54.039
Are you guys listening to me?

18:54.654 --> 18:55.621
I'm listening.

18:56.175 --> 18:56.887
Thank you, Ray.

18:56.888 --> 18:59.331
Jonathan, you gotta understand this from my perspective. 

18:59.332 --> 19:03.530
I thought that tonight was gonna be 
the Brighton Beach night that we never had.

19:03.531 --> 19:07.092
Remember, that's what you told me?
I stupidly believed you.

19:07.432 --> 19:10.158
Instead you drink vodka and you leave me alone, 

19:10.159 --> 19:14.151
while you chase after some Russian singer 
because you're investigating a case.

19:14.152 --> 19:17.863
But I was doing it in the name of love!
Somebody else's love!

19:17.864 --> 19:23.818
But you weren't doing this for anybody else but you.
You're selfish. You live in a selfish fantasy world.

19:23.819 --> 19:28.290
- Suzanne, please...
- Please, just do me one favor and don't talk to me.

19:29.403 --> 19:30.857
Next subway, please, sir.

19:33.744 --> 19:35.754
At least it wasn't me this time, right, baby?

19:41.523 --> 19:43.602
Hey Leah, for what it's worth, I'm on your side.

19:55.685 --> 19:59.600
- Irena?
- Yes. And you are the private cop?

19:59.601 --> 20:02.693
Yes. Or detective, or investigator,
they all work.

20:03.758 --> 20:06.424
Thank you for coming.
I don't like the phone.

20:06.425 --> 20:09.046
It's okay.
It's beautiful here.

20:09.135 --> 20:16.612
So. Let me make sure I got things straight.
You used to sing as The Lonely White Dove, is that right?

20:16.613 --> 20:19.435
- Yes.
- Then why did you switch to The Lonely Sparrow?

20:20.607 --> 20:23.919
I like birds.
Every year I'm a new bird.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.759
- I'm always a lonely bird.
- Maybe you won't have to be lonely anymore.

20:28.251 --> 20:32.365
- Dmitry hired me to find you.
- Why?

20:33.632 --> 20:35.026
Because he's in love with you.

20:39.008 --> 20:40.532
- He's still in prison?
- No.

20:41.228 --> 20:44.519
He's out, and he wants to see you.
Do you wanna see him?

20:49.890 --> 20:53.890
Yes.
I want to see him very much.

20:54.876 --> 20:57.765
Thank you very much, my little detective.

21:13.428 --> 21:15.899
My... my therapist suggested I try this.

21:17.139 --> 21:19.910
- Medical advice.
- You're coming out of the closet?

21:19.911 --> 21:22.383
Well, no. No, no, not exactly.

21:22.384 --> 21:29.433
Um... now, see, I'm trying to... I'm trying get in
touch with the feminine side of my nature.

21:30.479 --> 21:37.621
You see, I'm... Well, I run a magazine, and
we've lost nearly half of our women readers, and I...

21:39.058 --> 21:40.973
I've gotta reach them somehow.

21:41.332 --> 21:43.377
- And you think that this will help you.
- Maybe.

21:43.378 --> 21:46.866
You know, I'm just... You know, I wanna
open my mind.

21:46.867 --> 21:52.513
If you wanna open your mind...
Don't think in terms of male and female.

21:53.470 --> 21:56.912
I mean, it's binary, it's boring.
How about "no definition"?

21:57.657 --> 21:59.145
Have you read Klaus Kinski's memoir?

21:59.736 --> 22:05.415
- I... I haven't. You're talking about Werner Herzog's muse?
- Yeah.

22:05.917 --> 22:11.004
Kinski. Could fuck, or get fucked, it didn't matter,
he did what he wanted to, he defined himself.

22:11.005 --> 22:12.214
He was all sexes.

22:12.215 --> 22:13.215
Beyond definition.

22:14.860 --> 22:18.695
You want your magazine to do better?
Try to be like Klaus Kinski.

22:20.884 --> 22:24.644
Have you read a Woody Allen story,
The Whores of Mensa?

22:24.645 --> 22:28.599
I haven't. But, I love Woody's
prose more than his movies.

22:30.622 --> 22:38.905
So. You wanna give this a try?
I mean, I think that you are a good looking guy.

22:40.409 --> 22:42.159
Kind of like a buff Samuel Beckett.

22:46.563 --> 22:48.974
So, I'm escorting Dmitry to Tatiana's tonight.

22:48.975 --> 22:52.813
And he says he needs me to be his backup,
especially since he's breaking parole.

22:52.814 --> 22:53.961
- What, he said "backup"?
- Yeah.

22:54.512 --> 22:56.076
- That sounds dangerous.
- Well, he explained.

22:56.077 --> 22:59.729
It's more of a Russian wingman position,
and I'm an excellent wingman.

22:59.730 --> 23:02.417
I don't know, I don't think you should have
ever gotten involved with this guy.

23:02.418 --> 23:06.099
You know, Leah's still mad that I took her to that
night club last night, it really ruined our

23:06.100 --> 23:08.931
- first date in three months.
- I know. I am sorry, Ray,

23:08.932 --> 23:12.033
- but she shouldn't be mad at you, it's my fault.
- Yeah, it is your fault.

23:12.461 --> 23:16.484
And now, to make up for last night's
disaster I'm doing timed massages.

23:16.485 --> 23:20.061
It's an intimacy exercise.
She's out bringing an egg timer right now.

23:20.062 --> 23:21.012
- An egg timer?

23:21.013 --> 23:25.077
- Yeah, are you really wanna be this guy's backup, Russian wingman?
- Yes.

23:25.078 --> 23:31.339
I gave him my word. He thinks I'm a brave detective.
And he's already paid me, 200 dollars, so...

23:31.340 --> 23:34.148
Ok, well, in that case I have something for you.

23:41.461 --> 23:44.276
These are my uncle's.
They mean a lot to me.

23:45.419 --> 23:47.945
He died of cirrhosis of the liver.
These were also his.

23:49.508 --> 23:50.636
Try a gulp, don't lose those.

23:55.422 --> 23:59.824
Ray, I'm excited.
I got a really good egg timer.

24:03.991 --> 24:09.729
I love the boardwalk, it reminds me of The Black Sea.
Only I wish the girls were topless like in Russia.

24:09.730 --> 24:15.012
In America people are shy and disturbed, I don't
know, why be scared of the naked breast, huh?

24:15.013 --> 24:17.614
- Never been to a topless beach.
- Oh, I hope you'd go.

24:17.615 --> 24:22.925
Hey, listen, I was thinking about you yesterday.
You should take this girl that you loved...

24:22.926 --> 24:26.751
and bring her here, to Brighton Beach, and maybe
you could get back together and get married.

24:27.924 --> 24:33.128
Well, you must be psychic or something,
because... last night I tried that,

24:33.785 --> 24:36.135
And... well, I screwed the whole thing up.

24:36.653 --> 24:39.323
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

24:39.325 --> 24:44.392
It's like my heart's broken again, but
it's not as bad since I'm used to it.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.616
Irina!
You found her!

24:48.874 --> 24:51.267
Irina!
Krasavitsa!

24:53.458 --> 24:56.467
My brother is in prison because of you!
Bastard!

24:57.463 --> 25:01.664
???? ????
This doesn't involve you.

25:47.194 --> 25:48.147
Right here!

25:51.000 --> 25:53.094
- Oh shit, oh shit!
- What are you doing?

25:53.366 --> 25:55.711
Extra hiding! We're gonna die!

25:55.712 --> 25:57.921
You're not gonna die, you are fine,
you did good!

25:58.959 --> 26:01.327
You saved me, I'm grateful to you.

26:02.608 --> 26:04.850
- I did okay?
- Yeah, you're a real man.

26:04.851 --> 26:07.211
You showed me tonight... very brave.

26:07.212 --> 26:09.923
You hit the boss
right in the nose.

26:09.924 --> 26:12.843
- Ha-ha, it was beautiful!
- I wasn't actually aiming for him...

26:12.844 --> 26:13.923
- What?
- Nothing.

26:13.924 --> 26:18.766
I... nothing, I was just... I...
I'm just glad we took those jerks out.

26:19.546 --> 26:24.285
So wait, what happened with you and Irina's brother?
Why did she turn against you?

26:24.286 --> 26:27.739
We were doing a deal, and when
the cops got me, they got him.

26:28.392 --> 26:30.333
- And he's still in prison?
- Yeah.

26:30.931 --> 26:34.668
I didn't think she would hold it against me
after our night of great tenderness.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.866
But now my love for her is buried.

26:40.758 --> 26:44.314
But I will go on like you did.
With a broken heart.

26:50.244 --> 26:51.187
What do we do now?

26:52.724 --> 26:55.420
They go this way,
we go this way.

27:06.169 --> 27:10.298
Good bye, my new friend!
I don't know if I'll ever see you again.

27:11.106 --> 27:16.197
But I hope your heart is broken many times,
because it means you would have loved many times.

27:26.445 --> 27:30.290
Hi, George, listen, I know it's late,
I'm sorry I bother you, but...

27:30.724 --> 27:35.570
I've had the most incredible, insane night.
Er, would you wanna meet for a drink?

27:35.571 --> 27:39.493
Now's actually not a great time for me, 
I have company.

27:39.494 --> 27:43.755
- Do you remember what you told me to google?
- Holy shit!

27:44.083 --> 27:49.514
- How... How is it going?
- Well, I'm no Danny Kaye, if you know what I mean.

27:49.915 --> 27:52.628
I love Danny Kaye, especially 
"The Inspector General".

27:53.034 --> 27:54.489
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:55.154 --> 27:58.544
I have "The Inspector General",
we could watch it if you'd like.

27:58.545 --> 28:01.322
- I have all of Danny Kaye's films.
- I would love that.

28:01.323 --> 28:04.107
Hey, Jonathan, we're gonna watch "The Inspector General",

28:04.108 --> 28:07.194
you could come over if you'd like.
- He's a really nice guy.

28:28.861 --> 28:31.080
I hope Jonathan does not lose those brass knuckles.

28:32.072 --> 28:36.966
Could you please not talk about Jonathan,
this is an intimacy excercise about us.

28:37.888 --> 28:40.178
I'm sure he's fine.
