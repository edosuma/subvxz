WEBVTT

00:00.509 --> 00:04.309
Look at me, right?
And look at the Queen.

00:04.402 --> 00:07.262
I was never a fan until
it occurred to me how much

00:07.332 --> 00:08.852
me and Ma'am have in common.

00:08.892 --> 00:11.472
Bringing up kiddies you
can't remember the names of.

00:11.542 --> 00:13.300
I know she's not a single parent

00:13.302 --> 00:14.820
but she might as well be.

00:14.822 --> 00:17.780
Plus, the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns,

00:17.782 --> 00:21.782
her literally sometimes,
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.982 --> 00:24.620
Admired and despised equally.

00:24.622 --> 00:26.260
Not for never lifting a finger.

00:26.262 --> 00:29.340
No, for setting examples
through extremity.

00:29.342 --> 00:31.820
And whether you're a bigwig
on her end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.822 --> 00:35.822
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with, snip
snip snipping at your benefits.

00:35.942 --> 00:38.820
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking,

00:38.822 --> 00:41.020
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:41.022 --> 00:43.820
I got shot of my kids yonks back,

00:43.822 --> 00:45.980
whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:45.982 --> 00:49.500
I've had to get out of bed
on occasion to make ends meet

00:49.502 --> 00:53.502
whereas she, she's done the
whole thing from a chair.

00:54.182 --> 00:55.860
Oh, a drink for the lady.

00:55.862 --> 00:58.860
Oh, sure, there's perks.
But look at her lot.

00:58.862 --> 01:01.820
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:01.822 --> 01:05.822
Now look at my lot. We know how to
throw a proper fucking pa-a-arty!

'I know I don't look deep,
but sometimes I have thoughts,

01:15.638 --> 01:19.638
'big thoughts.
About life, death, love.

01:20.158 --> 01:23.476
'Top of your head, how
many kinds can you think of?

01:23.478 --> 01:27.478
'There's the unconditional
kind you're supposed
to have for your kids,

01:27.998 --> 01:31.998
'the physical kind between
a man and a woman...'

a state of mind.

01:40.078 --> 01:42.436
'It's all love.

you've got to have loved it first.

'If hate comes from love then
it can always be put back.

01:51.158 --> 01:55.158
'Right?'

02:00.038 --> 02:01.516
Mind out!

02:01.518 --> 02:02.518
Oh, sorry.

02:02.596 --> 02:04.394
Forget it.

02:04.396 --> 02:06.394
Did they get much?

02:06.396 --> 02:07.714
Enough.

02:07.716 --> 02:11.234
Get it back on insurance, though?

02:11.236 --> 02:12.474
No insurance?

02:12.476 --> 02:13.834
Ssh!

02:13.836 --> 02:14.954
Ouch.

02:14.956 --> 02:16.914
Yeah. I know. Ouch.

02:16.916 --> 02:19.234
Look, mate, I've got to get on.
What can I do for you?

02:19.236 --> 02:22.114
Actually, I came to see Remona.

02:22.116 --> 02:26.116
Ah, there she is!
Now then, love,

02:26.516 --> 02:29.194
look at you all domesticated!

02:29.196 --> 02:30.914
I did say I'd be passing.

02:30.916 --> 02:34.314
And I did say "Not interested."

02:34.316 --> 02:36.994
Let's see if I can simplify
that message further.

02:36.996 --> 02:40.996
Piss off, Dad.

02:41.196 --> 02:43.714
I can see you've got your
hands full this morning.

02:43.716 --> 02:47.716
Maybe if I pop back later?
Leave you to it, then.

02:48.756 --> 02:52.756
Scuse me, love.

02:53.436 --> 02:56.354
That was Remona's... dad.

02:56.356 --> 03:00.356
Messy bleeder, isn't he?

03:02.316 --> 03:05.834
Eh, couldn't lend us a quid,
could you? For some tabs?

03:05.836 --> 03:09.836
You can have two.

03:10.756 --> 03:14.756
Best part of you ran
down your mother's leg.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.034
Coffee's on the table,
help yourself. No milk, though.

03:18.036 --> 03:22.036
Shift, you.

03:27.356 --> 03:31.356
Shame we can't just stay
here all day, making love...

03:32.396 --> 03:36.234
falling asleep...

03:36.236 --> 03:39.754
waking up...

03:39.756 --> 03:41.594
making love again.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.794
It'd be brilliant and
everything but, you know,

03:44.796 --> 03:46.794
I kind of think they're
going to need you.

03:46.796 --> 03:50.796
Them suspects won't throw
themselves down the stairs.

03:51.556 --> 03:54.314
See you tomorrow, though, eh?

03:54.316 --> 03:57.314
Say it.

03:57.316 --> 04:00.434
You know, I need to hear it,
those three little words.

04:00.436 --> 04:02.954
- You know I can't leave until...
- I love you.

04:02.956 --> 04:06.436
I love you too.

04:57.636 --> 04:58.754
Hey!

04:58.756 --> 05:00.954
Oh, all right, son?

05:00.956 --> 05:02.994
Sorry you got stuck
in the middle back there.

05:02.996 --> 05:05.874
Oh, no, it's fine. It's just...

05:05.876 --> 05:08.234
Remona always made
her dad out to be...

05:08.236 --> 05:09.074
Older?

05:09.076 --> 05:13.034
Dead.

05:13.036 --> 05:16.554
Yeah, that'd be right.

05:16.556 --> 05:20.556
Always fancied herself
independent, that one.

05:20.596 --> 05:22.514
So are you and her...?

05:22.516 --> 05:25.954
No! Not that I wouldn't!

05:25.956 --> 05:29.634
I mean, I wouldn't, not cos there's
'owt wrong with her, it's just...

05:29.636 --> 05:32.834
I'm just messing.
Business partners, right?

05:32.836 --> 05:36.114
You're the one that
pays the insurance?

05:36.116 --> 05:40.116
Yeah. I sort of... haven't
mentioned it to her yet. So...

05:40.596 --> 05:41.874
My lips are sealed.

05:41.876 --> 05:44.594
Not that she's in any hurry
to be listening to me anyway.

05:44.596 --> 05:48.596
I don't blame her.
I was never around much.

05:49.356 --> 05:51.714
Listen, you couldn't
have a word, could you?

05:51.716 --> 05:55.394
I only want the chance to talk.
Plus, I'm pretty sure when she
hears what I've got to say

05:55.396 --> 05:59.396
she'll stop worrying about
your insurance problems.

06:00.516 --> 06:03.074
So he has the odd
party-smartie. So what?

06:03.076 --> 06:05.554
So nothing, Frank. I wasn't
raised in a nunnery,

06:05.556 --> 06:07.714
I couldn't care less
about a couple of pills.

06:07.716 --> 06:09.234
Not a couple though, is it?

06:09.236 --> 06:11.474
You could hardly call
this personal use.

06:11.476 --> 06:13.634
Oh, I don't know.

06:13.636 --> 06:16.314
Maybe I should take
'em off your hands, eh?

06:16.316 --> 06:20.316
Out of sight, out
of mind and all that.

06:22.196 --> 06:24.434
Thieving little bastards.

06:24.436 --> 06:27.434
Do you know what I'd do if I had
five minutes alone with them?

06:27.436 --> 06:31.436
Sew their mouths up with
fish-hooks and burn out their eyes?

06:34.636 --> 06:35.874
What?

06:35.876 --> 06:38.874
Nothing.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.914
Where've you been?

06:40.916 --> 06:43.874
Do you want to tell me
what that was all about
this morning with your dad?

06:43.876 --> 06:47.074
Dad?

06:47.076 --> 06:49.394
None of my business.

06:49.396 --> 06:51.194
He seemed to want to talk to you.

06:51.196 --> 06:53.514
Well, I didn't want
to talk to him.

06:53.516 --> 06:56.794
Let's leave it at that.
We don't get on.

06:56.796 --> 06:59.394
Why not?

06:59.396 --> 07:02.114
Cos he didn't come
to my ballet recital

07:02.116 --> 07:05.954
and he never bought me
a fucking pony. All right?

07:05.956 --> 07:08.474
You better go get those
insurance documents,

07:08.476 --> 07:10.674
I reckon we're a couple
of grand out here.

07:10.676 --> 07:13.194
No rush. I'll talk to them tomorrow.

07:13.196 --> 07:14.554
No rush?

07:14.556 --> 07:18.154
Yeah, you know, not me first
robbery. No point getting stressed.

07:18.156 --> 07:21.274
In fact, I reckon we get
this place cleared up,

07:21.276 --> 07:25.276
close early and head to
the pub. Put it all behind us.

07:25.676 --> 07:28.954
# I'm horny, horny, horny, horny

07:28.956 --> 07:32.914
# So horny, I'm horny, horny, horny

07:32.916 --> 07:36.354
# I'm horny, I'm
horny, horny, horny. #

07:36.356 --> 07:38.034
Where you going?

07:38.036 --> 07:42.036
For a slash.

07:44.436 --> 07:46.754
Young love, eh?

07:46.756 --> 07:50.756
Yeah. We're all rooting for them.

07:56.316 --> 08:00.316
Oh, you have got to
be fucking kidding me.

08:04.396 --> 08:08.154
Ah, that's what I like to see,
my daughter laughing and happy.

08:08.156 --> 08:09.954
Your Remona's dad?

08:09.956 --> 08:11.994
I'm proud to say I am, yes.

08:11.996 --> 08:13.554
What are you doing here?

08:13.556 --> 08:15.114
I just want to talk.

08:15.116 --> 08:16.914
You knew he was going to be here?

08:16.916 --> 08:19.074
I really think you
should hear him out.

08:19.076 --> 08:20.714
I've got something for you.

08:20.716 --> 08:21.994
I don't care!

08:21.996 --> 08:25.714
Me and Mindy have been downsizing.
Sold your mam's old place.

08:25.716 --> 08:28.154
This is your share.

08:28.156 --> 08:29.114
I don't want it.

08:29.116 --> 08:30.154
How much is it?

08:30.156 --> 08:31.194
Patreesha!

08:31.196 --> 08:32.554
30 grand.

08:32.556 --> 08:35.514
Shitting hell.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.154
I want you to have it.

08:37.155 --> 08:41.155
Me and Mindy want you to have it.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.354
Thank you.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.714
Well, I reckon that 30
G'll stretch to a round.

08:47.716 --> 08:48.876
For everybody!

08:53.516 --> 08:55.834
I know your lot don't
approve of alcohol.

08:55.836 --> 08:59.836
But you've got to spread the
happiness a bit, right, flower?

09:03.076 --> 09:05.434
Some twat's been through my stuff.

09:05.436 --> 09:09.436
Twat, twat!

09:11.556 --> 09:15.556
Know the difference between
buying and supplying? Ten years.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.154
What have you done with them?

09:18.156 --> 09:19.754
Tucked them away safe.

09:19.756 --> 09:23.756
You think you're so clever.

09:23.996 --> 09:27.996
# That's why the lady is a tramp

09:30.876 --> 09:34.876
# She loves the free,
fresh wind in her hair. #

09:36.796 --> 09:38.194
He's pretty good.

09:38.196 --> 09:41.554
Pretty good? I'm getting a
wide-on here like a yawning fox.

09:41.556 --> 09:45.556
# She's broke, but it's O...

09:45.876 --> 09:48.994
# ..K, it's California

09:48.996 --> 09:52.194
# It's so cold and so damp... #

09:52.196 --> 09:55.874
Are you pissed off at me?

09:55.876 --> 09:59.234
For not paying the insurance, yes.

09:59.236 --> 10:02.034
For letting him smarm round you? No.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.594
It's what he does. All an act.

10:04.596 --> 10:05.876
Just like that is.

10:06.716 --> 10:08.956
Yeah. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:14.276 --> 10:18.034
I'd chuck me knickers but
I'd have to ring 'em out first.

10:18.036 --> 10:19.674
Nice one, Barry.

10:19.676 --> 10:23.676
Cheers, Chesney. My wife Mindy
likes a bit of Ol' Blue Eyes.

10:23.796 --> 10:26.434
Remona's mum did an'
all, didn't she, love?

10:26.436 --> 10:28.394
I don't remember her
having any choice.

10:28.396 --> 10:31.754
So come on, you have...

10:31.756 --> 10:35.756
All right?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.074
You haven't even
told me how you are.

10:38.076 --> 10:39.434
Peachy.

10:39.436 --> 10:42.434
That's good. Wish I
could say the same.

10:42.436 --> 10:45.914
I've not been too well.
Heart problems, you know?

10:45.916 --> 10:48.194
Or you would if we talked any more.

10:48.196 --> 10:51.154
I don't even remember the last time
you sent us a Christmas card.

10:51.156 --> 10:54.074
I'm a Muslim. I don't
do Christmas, you know that.

10:54.076 --> 10:55.914
You used to, when you were little.

10:55.916 --> 10:59.916
I remember this one time, when me
and her mum were still together,

11:00.836 --> 11:03.714
I was in bed, I heard
some noise downstairs.

11:03.716 --> 11:05.754
I thought somebody had broken in.

11:05.756 --> 11:08.914
So I crept down, threw
open the living room door

11:08.916 --> 11:11.514
and there's Remona,
holding a spanner.

11:11.516 --> 11:14.874
She'd dismantled the fire and dumped
it into the middle of the floor.

11:14.876 --> 11:17.794
She must've only been about six.
I said "What are you doing?"

11:17.796 --> 11:20.834
She said "How the fuck can
Santa get down the chimney

11:20.836 --> 11:23.834
"with the fire in the way?"

11:23.836 --> 11:27.154
Why don't you tell them
how that story ends?

11:27.156 --> 11:28.994
How do you mean?

11:28.996 --> 11:32.996
You can't have forgotten, surely?
I stepped out of line, didn't I?

11:33.116 --> 11:37.116
How would one of those
stories usually end?

11:38.156 --> 11:40.714
You're not going, are you?

11:40.716 --> 11:44.716
Stay and have a drink
with me, with your friends.

11:45.196 --> 11:47.434
Jamie, can we have another
drink for everybody here

11:47.436 --> 11:49.125
and I'll settle up
with you later, yeah?

12:00.712 --> 12:02.072
Oh, ta.

12:05.312 --> 12:07.252
Like old times, innit?

12:07.292 --> 12:09.770
Fetching your old man his breakfast
brew.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.890
Not really. When I was little,
I could never work out

12:12.892 --> 12:16.892
how to get the top off
the rat-poison...

12:17.292 --> 12:21.292
I've got it down now though.

12:23.572 --> 12:27.330
Ah...

12:27.332 --> 12:31.332
Never were a morning person,
were you?

12:34.172 --> 12:37.050
What was I supposed to do?
Leave the guy on the street?

12:37.052 --> 12:39.730
Fuck's sake, Remona,
30 grand he just give you.

12:39.732 --> 12:41.930
Yeah? Well the sooner
it's spent the better.

12:41.932 --> 12:44.450
Eh, do you reckon
we still need a new van?

12:44.452 --> 12:45.690
You serious?

12:45.692 --> 12:48.010
If you could put some cash
down for one this morning,

12:48.012 --> 12:50.330
I'll square up with you
once the cheque clears.

12:50.332 --> 12:51.810
Too fucking right, I can.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.650
Eh, eh, eh, sturdy and functional.

12:54.652 --> 12:58.652
How many women have
described my good self.

13:00.372 --> 13:02.570
Hey, that was Mindy.
Sends her love.

13:02.572 --> 13:05.250
My arse. Where is she anyway?

13:05.252 --> 13:06.810
Visiting her mum.

13:06.812 --> 13:09.930
So that's why you're really here.
Didn't fancy being outnumbered?

13:09.932 --> 13:13.410
All right, couldn't stand being under
the same roof as that miserable cow.

13:13.412 --> 13:15.770
But I'm here
because I wanted to see you.

13:15.772 --> 13:18.850
I once again refer you to my arse.

13:18.852 --> 13:22.090
I could swear I had some on
me, can we sort it later, yeah?

13:22.092 --> 13:23.170
No credit.

13:23.172 --> 13:27.170
Oh come on, Bet Laden!
Fucking 30 grand up?

13:27.172 --> 13:29.610
You can't want the full
whack for a nose job surely,

13:29.612 --> 13:33.050
not even with one like yours.

13:33.052 --> 13:37.052
That's my fucking daughter
you're talking to!

13:38.852 --> 13:42.852
You have my condolences.

13:44.572 --> 13:48.572
I... stand up for myself!

13:52.212 --> 13:53.490
Barry, she...

13:53.492 --> 13:55.770
All right, it's all right.

13:55.772 --> 13:59.730
You off somewhere?

13:59.732 --> 14:03.090
OK then, well, if he comes sniffing
round, I'll tell him to do one,

14:03.092 --> 14:05.210
but he'll only score somewhere else.

14:05.212 --> 14:09.212
You can leave me to worry about
that one. Thanks, Shane.

14:10.012 --> 14:14.012
Hiya.

14:15.452 --> 14:16.650
What's she doing here?

14:16.652 --> 14:19.930
Had a problem with the lad.
Needed some advice, why?

14:19.932 --> 14:21.090
I don't like her.

14:21.092 --> 14:22.610
Mm-hm?

14:22.612 --> 14:26.612
I can read people. Part of the job.

14:27.132 --> 14:31.132
Speaking of jobs...

14:31.412 --> 14:33.610
No, let's go to mine.

14:33.612 --> 14:36.170
I want you all to myself.

14:36.172 --> 14:40.172
Don't want anyone disturbing us.

14:40.612 --> 14:42.170
Who's gonna disturb us anyway?

14:42.172 --> 14:43.690
You tell me.

14:43.692 --> 14:47.692
Other women asking for advice?

14:52.932 --> 14:56.490
Now them are some wheels
I could see you behind.

14:56.492 --> 14:57.970
Remona wants a van.

14:57.972 --> 14:59.610
Got to do what the boss says, eh?

14:59.612 --> 15:03.612
She's not my boss.
But, it is her money.

15:05.292 --> 15:08.330
Sometimes in life, son, you've got to
make the call yourself,

15:08.332 --> 15:10.370
worry about what other
people say later.

15:10.372 --> 15:11.810
Don't want to get to the end

15:11.812 --> 15:14.570
with nowt but a list of regrets,
believe me.

15:14.572 --> 15:17.210
Get to the end? You're not that
fucking old, Barry.

15:17.212 --> 15:21.010
Not always age that see's
you off, you know?

15:21.012 --> 15:22.130
So what are you saying?

15:22.132 --> 15:26.132
Here you are, mate!
Let me do the talking, lad.

15:26.532 --> 15:27.930
It's the bollocks, innit?

15:27.932 --> 15:29.370
That's one word for it.

15:29.372 --> 15:31.890
What the shitting fuck?!

15:31.892 --> 15:34.130
What do you reckon?
Got a good deal on it too.

15:34.132 --> 15:38.132
Did you? And what did you spend
the rest on? Some magic beans?

15:38.492 --> 15:40.570
A van, Chesney. I said a van.

15:40.572 --> 15:43.490
All the vans were over-priced,
flower. This was a steal.

15:43.492 --> 15:46.690
Oh, I might have fucking known.

15:46.692 --> 15:48.970
He talked the guy
down an extra five ton.

15:48.972 --> 15:51.650
He was amazing,
you should be thanking him.

15:51.652 --> 15:54.650
Wake up, Chesney, for fuck's sake!

15:54.652 --> 15:55.730
What?

15:55.732 --> 15:58.250
It's me she's angry with,
son, not you.

15:58.252 --> 16:02.252
She hates me,
I'm just making it worse.

16:02.532 --> 16:06.532
Good to meet you, son.

16:09.012 --> 16:10.370
What?

16:10.372 --> 16:14.372
I've got an idea.

16:15.492 --> 16:16.970
Dig in, Barry.

16:16.972 --> 16:18.490
Well, this is nice.

16:18.492 --> 16:21.130
I thought it would be
a packet of cheese and onion

16:21.132 --> 16:23.690
down the pub for my tea.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.850
A family dinner.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.852
Just what the doctor ordered,
Chesney. Cheers.

16:30.692 --> 16:32.330
A family dinner?

16:32.332 --> 16:33.530
In a sense.

16:33.532 --> 16:36.170
Cos this would be your perfect
family, of course?

16:36.172 --> 16:40.130
I always hoped you'd settle down
someday, start one of your own.

16:40.132 --> 16:43.210
Find a nice man to take care of you.

16:43.212 --> 16:46.170
So, how long have you
and Mindy been together?

16:46.172 --> 16:50.172
Nearly 30 years. Don't regret a day.

16:50.372 --> 16:53.170
Here...

16:53.172 --> 16:54.970
Wow! She's beautiful.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.490
She wants to be too.

16:56.492 --> 16:58.850
Just had the works done,
face lift, boob job.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.570
Over two grand's worth. I paid for
it, a birthday present.

17:01.572 --> 17:02.692
Yeah, yours.

17:04.811 --> 17:08.609
Well, like I said,
a man has to take care of his woman.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.290
Isn't that right, Chesney?

17:10.291 --> 17:13.212
Er, think very
carefully about your answer.

17:17.972 --> 17:19.332
Barry? You OK?

17:20.452 --> 17:23.650
I'm all right. I'm all right.

17:23.652 --> 17:25.410
No, it's all right...

17:25.412 --> 17:29.412
I'm fine.

17:30.692 --> 17:33.690
Something wrong, love?

17:33.692 --> 17:37.692
Just what is it you think
that you're doing?

17:39.652 --> 17:40.690
Sorry?

17:40.692 --> 17:41.730
Remona.

17:41.732 --> 17:45.732
A man takes care of his woman?
Is that your spin on it, is it?

17:46.492 --> 17:48.970
Now, I know I'm a bit
set in my ways,

17:48.972 --> 17:52.290
I know I'm a little
old-fashioned in my beliefs.

17:52.292 --> 17:55.050
I certainly don't mean to be
'politically incorrect'.

17:55.052 --> 17:57.930
I just happen to think, in my
culture, as well as in yours...

17:57.932 --> 18:00.850
Don't. Just don't.

18:00.852 --> 18:03.730
I'm not playing this game anymore.

18:03.732 --> 18:06.410
I want you... out of my flat.

18:06.412 --> 18:07.810
Wait, your flat?

18:07.812 --> 18:08.970
Stay out of it, Chesney.

18:08.972 --> 18:10.490
I won't fucking stay out of it.

18:10.492 --> 18:13.130
No, all right, son.
I think maybe this was a bad idea.

18:13.132 --> 18:15.930
You're not going anywhere.
He's not going anywhere.

18:15.932 --> 18:17.730
For fuck's sake, Remona,
he's your Dad!

18:17.732 --> 18:21.732
He just gave you 30 grand.

18:23.572 --> 18:27.572
Take it, get out
and don't ever come back.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.770
Barry.

18:33.772 --> 18:35.650
I'm so sorry about this.

18:35.652 --> 18:37.850
I don't know what,
just do me a favour, yeah?

18:37.852 --> 18:41.852
Look out for her.

18:50.972 --> 18:53.810
And surprise, surprise...

18:53.812 --> 18:56.250
it sinks. The end.

18:56.252 --> 19:00.010
It's not about the ship sinking.
It's a tragic romance.

19:00.012 --> 19:04.012
Mmm. It's that all right.

19:05.172 --> 19:07.210
Isn't she beautiful?

19:07.212 --> 19:08.412
Who, her?

19:10.492 --> 19:12.050
Bit porky.

19:12.052 --> 19:14.012
Not really my type.

19:17.052 --> 19:19.612
She looks a bit like that Esther,
doesn't she?

19:22.332 --> 19:26.332
Not really.

19:26.612 --> 19:29.370
What was this advice
you were giving her anyway?

19:29.372 --> 19:31.530
What does it matter?

19:31.532 --> 19:34.130
Why won't you tell me?

19:34.132 --> 19:35.170
Because it's...

19:35.172 --> 19:36.970
What? Private?

19:36.972 --> 19:38.850
A little secret between you and her?

19:38.852 --> 19:40.850
Oh, for fuck's sake!

19:40.852 --> 19:44.170
She's worried about her lad dealing,
all right?

19:44.172 --> 19:46.890
And I don't think she'd be too
made up about me

19:46.892 --> 19:50.892
telling that fact
to a fucking copper, do you?

19:58.172 --> 20:02.172
You didn't tell it to a copper,
you told it to your girlfriend.

20:14.452 --> 20:17.130
You do know these are, like,
the extra strength ones?

20:17.132 --> 20:20.490
Yeah. Well, wouldn't be better off
with a toilet plunger?

20:20.492 --> 20:22.450
They're not for me,
they're for Frank.

20:22.452 --> 20:24.290
His arse-pipes are bunged up
to fuck.

20:24.292 --> 20:26.330
Hard to believe he's still single.

20:26.332 --> 20:28.690
Barry's left his heart
pills in the bathroom.

20:28.692 --> 20:29.530
So?

20:29.532 --> 20:31.050
He might need 'em?

20:31.052 --> 20:32.650
And me without a carrier pigeon.

20:32.652 --> 20:34.050
What's wrong with you?

20:34.052 --> 20:36.650
Bad enough you throw his money back
in his face,

20:36.652 --> 20:39.130
when we've still got
a car to pay off, stock to replace,

20:39.132 --> 20:41.970
and a three figure tab down
the Jockey.

20:41.972 --> 20:43.490
All he was trying to do was help.

20:43.492 --> 20:47.492
Out of the goodness of his poorly,
poorly heart.

20:55.052 --> 20:56.890
She's totally predictable.

20:56.892 --> 21:00.892
Under the sink, back of the knife
draw...

21:01.332 --> 21:04.010
or...

21:04.012 --> 21:08.012
Yep, drawer number three.

21:30.452 --> 21:34.452
Barry! Barry!

21:38.612 --> 21:42.612
Barry!

21:49.492 --> 21:51.010
Barry? Barry!

21:51.012 --> 21:53.730
What the fuck?!

21:53.732 --> 21:56.530
What, are you trying to give me
a heart attack?

21:56.532 --> 21:57.912
I thought you'd had one.

22:02.092 --> 22:05.050
I was just a bit upset
about what happened with Remona.

22:05.052 --> 22:06.650
I had a few drinks, that's all.

22:06.652 --> 22:08.410
Mm-hm.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.170
Mindy still at her mum's is she?

22:10.172 --> 22:11.490
Yeah.

22:11.492 --> 22:13.250
Maybe we should ring her.

22:13.252 --> 22:17.252
I told you, I'm fine.

22:18.412 --> 22:20.730
I think you should come back
to ours...

22:20.732 --> 22:22.290
just till Mindy's home.

22:22.292 --> 22:23.810
You shouldn't be by yourself.

22:23.812 --> 22:26.010
You reckon I'd be welcome
there, do you?

22:26.012 --> 22:29.450
My dad was a prick. Some dads are.
Maybe you were too.

22:29.452 --> 22:32.010
But, the difference is you want
to change all that,

22:32.012 --> 22:33.970
make things right, don't you?

22:33.972 --> 22:37.010
You heard her. It's too late.

22:37.012 --> 22:41.012
Wouldn't even take my money.
What does that say?

22:41.092 --> 22:42.490
That you need to try again.

22:42.492 --> 22:44.490
I dunno,
I don't think I wanna keep on.

22:44.492 --> 22:46.850
"Don't want to get to the end
with a list of regrets."

22:46.852 --> 22:48.290
That's what you said, isn't it?

22:48.292 --> 22:52.292
Yeah, but... Then come on.

23:03.492 --> 23:07.492
Oh, shit.

23:11.212 --> 23:13.890
Will you just listen?
I went round to drop his pills off

23:13.892 --> 23:17.010
and he was passed out on the couch,
pissed. The place was a shit-hole.

23:17.012 --> 23:19.210
Oh, stop,
you're making me nostalgic.

23:19.212 --> 23:23.212
I think Mindy's left him.
He's not admitted it, but...

23:25.732 --> 23:27.250
Is it true then?

23:27.252 --> 23:30.170
Yeah, it's true. She left.

23:30.172 --> 23:31.610
I don't know where she is.

23:31.612 --> 23:33.930
The Stepford wife breaks her
programming.

23:33.932 --> 23:37.010
Well, come on, what finally
pushed her over the edge?

23:37.012 --> 23:41.012
We had a row, about me
wanting to see you, about the money.

23:42.012 --> 23:44.130
You can't stop, can you?

23:44.132 --> 23:47.170
And you, you're actually buying
this bullshit, are you?

23:47.172 --> 23:49.090
He's upset.

23:49.092 --> 23:50.490
And he's not well

23:50.492 --> 23:52.970
and I'm going to help him
find her again and until I do,

23:52.972 --> 23:54.570
he's staying with us.

23:54.572 --> 23:58.572
If he takes another
step inside that flat...

23:58.892 --> 24:00.937
There is no us.

24:11.793 --> 24:13.713
We're going as family.

24:14.451 --> 24:15.891
So where's Tam?

24:15.949 --> 24:18.347
He's going to meet us there,
with Aiden.

24:18.349 --> 24:19.947
It'll be fun, and informative,

24:19.949 --> 24:22.387
something for all generations
to enjoy together.

24:22.389 --> 24:23.569
Karen and Shane are coming.

24:23.627 --> 24:24.945
It'll be shit.

24:24.947 --> 24:28.947
Any more "twats" and "shits" out
of you and I'll break your fingers.

24:29.347 --> 24:30.785
Room for a little 'un?

24:30.787 --> 24:32.025
You coming along?

24:32.027 --> 24:34.265
Oh, yeah, yeah,
big fan of Polish culture, me.

24:34.267 --> 24:36.185
Yeah. And there's vodka tasting.

24:36.187 --> 24:40.187
Oh.

24:47.947 --> 24:49.705
Oh, you're taking the pills
with you?

24:49.707 --> 24:51.425
I think Tam's been looking for them.

24:51.427 --> 24:53.025
Safer to keep 'em on me.

24:53.027 --> 24:55.785
There's easier ways to get
rid of a bag of pills, you know.

24:55.787 --> 24:59.787
I'll bear it in mind.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.745
Stick this on.

25:03.747 --> 25:05.745
Bit of driving music
to get us in the mood.

25:05.747 --> 25:07.305
Best Of Frank Sinatra?

25:07.307 --> 25:09.507
I like it. It soothes me.

25:13.707 --> 25:16.625
They'll have proper Polish grub,
traditional music,

25:16.627 --> 25:18.345
probably get us doing the polka!

25:18.347 --> 25:19.745
I don't dance.

25:19.747 --> 25:21.305
Neither do the Poles.

25:21.307 --> 25:23.865
You mentioned something
about free vodka?

25:23.867 --> 25:27.065
Vodka tasting, yeah, it's practically
a religion with them.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.145
98% proof, could strip a corpse.

25:30.147 --> 25:33.305
Me and Kassi been to one of these
once, back at our old place.

25:33.307 --> 25:37.307
I warn you now, after a few shots,
things can get a little raucous.

25:45.467 --> 25:49.467
Fuck me, have the Germans just left?

25:54.507 --> 25:57.385
Mindy comes here every month
to get her Botox done.

25:57.387 --> 26:01.387
Another thing I fucking pay for.

26:01.547 --> 26:05.425
You stay here.

26:05.427 --> 26:09.427
Sorry.

26:17.787 --> 26:19.465
Pierogi.

26:19.467 --> 26:23.467
Farmer's cheese.

26:26.467 --> 26:30.467
Mmm. Tastes like it.

26:31.387 --> 26:35.387
Nothing like treating the pallet to
exciting, new experiences, is there?

26:35.867 --> 26:39.105
Speaking of which,
when's the vodka tasting commencing?

26:39.107 --> 26:43.107
Only in the evening.
Otherwise, everyone get... shitfaced.

26:43.867 --> 26:44.985
Right.

26:44.987 --> 26:47.865
Beer though.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.945
What?

26:50.947 --> 26:54.947
Oh! Right.

27:01.907 --> 27:03.425
Can't believe how shit this is.

27:03.427 --> 27:05.145
I can.

27:05.147 --> 27:09.147
But since we're here,
why not liven things up a bit?

27:21.627 --> 27:25.627
Drive.

27:26.987 --> 27:29.585
This isn't as much fun as I'd led you
to believe, is it?

27:29.587 --> 27:32.945
No, it's great.

27:32.947 --> 27:36.185
Yeah, yeah, and you can stop
grinning at me too.

27:36.187 --> 27:38.065
I didn't know I was.

27:38.067 --> 27:42.067
All right. Point taken. Clear off
then, take Saul and Thalia with you.

27:42.587 --> 27:44.105
Family time's over.

27:44.107 --> 27:45.465
Nice!

27:45.467 --> 27:49.025
Feel free to join them.

27:49.027 --> 27:51.705
I don't think so, do you?

27:51.707 --> 27:53.745
Now that the hobbits
have fucked off,

27:53.747 --> 27:57.747
what's say we crack open
the contraband? Eh?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.465
You don't want to go now, do you?

28:00.467 --> 28:02.345
Not now it's all kicking off.

28:02.347 --> 28:06.347
Fuck it. Why not?

28:06.467 --> 28:10.467
Nah. I'm watching me figure, thanks.

28:24.627 --> 28:28.627
Right. I know I'm going to regret
asking this, but what's up with you?

28:29.867 --> 28:31.865
It's me and your mum.

28:31.867 --> 28:34.345
Things aren't going
too well at the moment,

28:34.347 --> 28:37.585
so I'm just trying to think of ways
to bring us closer together.

28:37.587 --> 28:39.665
Don't look at me, she's your wife.

28:39.667 --> 28:40.945
But she's your mum.

28:40.947 --> 28:44.825
If I was married to her... I can't
believe I just fucking said that,

28:44.827 --> 28:47.865
I wouldn't go for flowers and
all that shit, I'd do something big.

28:47.867 --> 28:51.105
You know, a gesture, a declaration.
Surprise her.

28:51.107 --> 28:52.785
Have you got something for me?

28:52.787 --> 28:54.345
320, right?

28:54.347 --> 28:57.065
Well, 321, to be exact,
but I'll let you off.

28:57.067 --> 29:01.067
No, you won't. I pay my debts.

29:02.827 --> 29:04.865
Unless you want to toss for it.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.265
You serious?

29:06.267 --> 29:07.945
As a heart attack.

29:07.947 --> 29:11.947
I'll have some of that. Heads.

29:19.147 --> 29:21.305
Maybe her mum's gone out
for the day.

29:21.307 --> 29:23.345
What about some of Mindy's friends?
See if...

29:23.347 --> 29:24.905
She hasn't got any.

29:24.907 --> 29:26.265
She's got to have some.

29:26.267 --> 29:29.905
I said she hasn't got any.

29:29.907 --> 29:31.505
Should've put this on the meter.

29:31.507 --> 29:33.665
Would've made a fortune.

29:33.667 --> 29:36.305
I think you're forgetting
who paid for this car.

29:36.307 --> 29:39.305
Er... I did. Seeing as Remona
hasn't given me the money back.

29:39.307 --> 29:42.625
Yeah, well, don't hold your breath.
She's tighter than a nun's chuff.

29:42.627 --> 29:44.345
About as much fucking use.

29:44.347 --> 29:48.347
Just like her mother.

29:51.067 --> 29:52.345
What's this?

29:52.347 --> 29:55.345
Two weeks redundancy.
I'm closing the chemist. Moving on.

29:55.347 --> 29:59.347
What?

30:06.267 --> 30:10.267
# So deep in my heart,
you're almost a part of me... #

30:13.067 --> 30:15.345
Got you.

30:15.347 --> 30:16.707
Now, then.

30:19.027 --> 30:20.105
Avril.

30:20.107 --> 30:21.505
I don't know where she is.

30:21.507 --> 30:23.465
Bollocks. Just bloody tell me.

30:23.467 --> 30:25.745
Oh, fuck's sake!
I'll be back as soon as I can.

30:25.747 --> 30:27.025
I don't know!

30:27.027 --> 30:28.265
Lying slag!

30:28.267 --> 30:30.225
Don't keep her from me!

30:30.227 --> 30:32.585
You fucking know where she is!

30:32.587 --> 30:33.745
Barry!

30:33.747 --> 30:35.625
You can't keep her from me! What?

30:35.627 --> 30:38.385
I need to get back.
Remona's closed the shop up.

30:38.387 --> 30:40.545
So let her. You don't need her.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.185
I'm worried about her.

30:42.187 --> 30:43.905
Then you're a mug.

30:43.907 --> 30:47.465
Wash your hands and count yourself
fucking lucky.

30:47.467 --> 30:51.467
I need to get back, really.
So unless you fancy walking...

30:51.707 --> 30:55.707
Then drive me again tomorrow.

31:12.747 --> 31:14.145
You been to the bogs again?

31:14.147 --> 31:15.425
Dunno what's up with me.

31:15.427 --> 31:17.345
Stop leaving us on me todd,
will you?

31:17.347 --> 31:18.585
Every time you fuck off

31:18.587 --> 31:21.347
some old Polish dear comes up
and asks me to dance.

31:23.947 --> 31:25.745
Oh, for fuck's sake, really?

31:25.747 --> 31:27.425
Stop, stop, stop!

31:27.427 --> 31:29.905
Are you actually buzzing? At all?

31:29.907 --> 31:32.465
No.

31:32.467 --> 31:36.225
Hey!

31:36.227 --> 31:38.825
What sort of fucking duff pills
you selling her, lad?

31:38.827 --> 31:40.945
Piss off, Frank,
I'm a man of honour.

31:40.947 --> 31:43.185
I never sell kids anything
but pure grade.

31:43.187 --> 31:46.105
I reckon they were a bad batch,
you know.

31:46.107 --> 31:48.785
Those pills your kid sold us.

31:48.787 --> 31:49.905
Good shit.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.625
Na zdrowie!

31:52.627 --> 31:55.667
Tam, he's fucking had us!

31:56.907 --> 31:58.265
Oh!

31:58.267 --> 32:02.267
Oh!

32:04.547 --> 32:08.547
Keep walking.

32:10.427 --> 32:12.107
Hurry up, it's an emergency!

32:23.827 --> 32:27.827
Ooh...

32:36.947 --> 32:40.947
Ta da!

32:46.587 --> 32:50.587
We're closed!

32:51.667 --> 32:53.025
What you doing here?

32:53.027 --> 32:54.305
I've left Barry.

32:54.307 --> 32:55.905
I'm going to go and live in Spain.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.145
Oh, well, don't be a stranger.

32:58.147 --> 33:00.145
He's taken me passport.

33:00.147 --> 33:03.505
You've got to help me.
You can do that, can't you?

33:03.507 --> 33:06.105
That sort of thing.
You've got contacts.

33:06.107 --> 33:07.345
I mean, you're...

33:07.347 --> 33:10.785
Yeah, I'll get straight on the phone
to Al-Qaeda HQ, shall I?

33:10.787 --> 33:14.787
Phony passport department, please?

33:15.627 --> 33:19.627
He'll really hurt me this time...
Or worse.

33:24.587 --> 33:27.545
Can't believe I was outsmarted
by a 15-year-old.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.785
I can't believe you were up
Morris dancing

33:29.787 --> 33:31.945
without the aid of class As.

33:31.947 --> 33:33.585
This looks cosy.

33:33.587 --> 33:35.065
What're you doing here?

33:35.067 --> 33:36.945
Got a call about a disturbance.

33:36.947 --> 33:38.345
That'll be Frank's arse.

33:38.347 --> 33:40.265
Look, why don't I leave you two
alone?

33:40.267 --> 33:41.825
Make a fucking change.

33:41.827 --> 33:43.945
- Have you got a problem?
- Yeah - you.

33:43.947 --> 33:45.145
Hang on...

33:45.147 --> 33:49.147
I am tired of seeing her buzzing
around you like a fly on shit.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.745
We were just talking.

33:50.747 --> 33:51.945
Not what I saw.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.625
Sorry, I think I need to...

33:54.627 --> 33:55.865
Seriously, this is...

33:55.867 --> 33:58.025
Don't say anything, Shane.
You'll make it worse.

33:58.027 --> 33:59.225
Sweetheart, really...

33:59.227 --> 34:01.105
Are you saying I'm making it up?!

34:01.107 --> 34:05.107
I saw what I saw.

34:12.587 --> 34:15.025
How long's it going
to take you to pack?

34:15.027 --> 34:18.985
Well, it'll be a lot quicker
if you zip it.

34:18.987 --> 34:21.824
Hi, Mindy. Just calling
to make sure you're safe.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.545
I'm really worried about you...

34:23.547 --> 34:24.784
Where you going?

34:24.786 --> 34:26.065
Haven't decided.

34:26.067 --> 34:28.225
I love you.

34:28.226 --> 34:30.465
Maybe you could come
to Spain with me.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.065
Get your mate to do you
a fake passport an' all?

34:33.067 --> 34:34.505
What a good idea.

34:34.507 --> 34:38.105
Because he's got a two for one offer
on at the moment, as it goes.

34:38.107 --> 34:39.427
Do they do that?

34:41.746 --> 34:44.065
- What the fuck is she doing here?
- Where's Barry?

34:44.067 --> 34:46.945
He's on his way up. You can't let
him see her. He'll kill her.

34:46.947 --> 34:49.784
Really? So what happened
to poor old cuddly Bazza?

34:49.786 --> 34:52.585
You were right, I was wrong,
he's a bastard and I'm a twat.

34:52.587 --> 34:54.465
Just get her hid - quick.

34:54.467 --> 34:58.467
Right. In the bedroom G, O - go!

35:05.107 --> 35:09.107
You got any booze?

35:09.547 --> 35:11.228
I've got some whisky somewhere.

35:31.877 --> 35:33.837
These are nice. Are they Debenhams'?

35:36.437 --> 35:39.037
What's up with you?

35:39.160 --> 35:41.478
He's playing our song.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.038
Which means he's really missing me.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.758
Maybe this is a sign that me and him
are meant to be together.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.878
We always were like
Burton and Taylor.

35:50.880 --> 35:54.638
You're not even Bert
and fuckin' Ernie!

35:54.640 --> 35:56.998
He's a bastard -
you're not going back to him.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.438
Me plane leaves in the morning.
Without a passport...

35:59.440 --> 36:01.358
I said I'd get that sorted!

36:01.360 --> 36:02.958
Now, it'd be a lot easier

36:02.960 --> 36:06.078
if we could get you round
to the guy's flat to do it,

36:06.080 --> 36:09.318
but if the mountain won't come
to Muhammad...

36:09.320 --> 36:11.838
I thought his name were Tariq?

36:11.840 --> 36:15.840
There's just one thing...

36:15.920 --> 36:18.238
he only does passports for Muslims.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.678
I'm C of E!

36:20.680 --> 36:23.838
I won't have time to convert!

36:23.840 --> 36:27.840
I need a tissue. Where's me handbag?

36:30.480 --> 36:31.998
Oh, shit!

36:32.000 --> 36:35.198
Long day, eh? You must be tired.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.638
I'm too pissed off to be tired.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.958
Good night's sleep'll sort that.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.958
Do you want to do me up the arse?

36:42.960 --> 36:44.318
What? No!

36:44.320 --> 36:46.798
Why are you trying to get me
into bed?

36:46.800 --> 36:48.318
Oh!

36:48.320 --> 36:50.278
I thought you'd gone.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.280
Well, you know us women,
fickle as fuck.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.638
Anyway, it's not you
I've come to see.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.078
I've come about those new
carrier bags you ordered.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.318
You what?

37:01.320 --> 37:03.078
The bags.

37:03.080 --> 37:05.358
They're no good. Get rid of 'em.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.038
Er...

37:07.040 --> 37:10.440
Yeah, the bags. I'll sort it.

37:16.240 --> 37:20.240
Just left summat in the car, Barry.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.520
Cheers.

37:37.640 --> 37:38.798
Well?

37:38.800 --> 37:42.398
It's sorted.
Now all we need to do is sort you.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.878
What's that for?

37:44.880 --> 37:48.880
Converting to Islam's going to be
a lot easier than you think.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.438
It'll be all right.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.480
Yeah.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.518
Is he asleep?

38:10.520 --> 38:13.958
Yeah, I think.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.158
What happened to you?

38:15.160 --> 38:19.160
Meet Fatima Abdu Zaid.

38:19.360 --> 38:22.198
You might want to learn to
spell that, by the way.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.798
Listen, Mindy, about all this...

38:24.800 --> 38:27.478
I only helped him cos I thought
he really loved you.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.358
And, well, cos of his health.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.758
What about his health?

38:30.760 --> 38:32.278
You know, his heart an' that.

38:32.280 --> 38:36.280
His heart's fine.
He's got mild angina.

38:36.440 --> 38:40.440
Lying turd!

38:41.480 --> 38:42.878
So what's the plan then?

38:42.880 --> 38:45.478
If I'm going to get her out of here,

38:45.480 --> 38:48.478
I need you to get him
off our backs while I do it.

38:48.480 --> 38:51.118
Don't make me spend any more time
with that prick, please.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.558
You're the reason that prick's here.

38:53.560 --> 38:57.560
Oh, and I'm going to need the car.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.398
Morning.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.718
All right. Sleep OK?

39:09.720 --> 39:10.998
Yeah, why?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.158
Only, I kept hearing you
going to the bog all night.

39:13.160 --> 39:16.998
I had an upset stomach. Probably
something I ate at the Centre.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.238
Weird, cos Aidan texted earlier

39:19.240 --> 39:21.838
and said Frank's had the shits
from some dodgy Es.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.198
Really?

39:23.200 --> 39:25.958
How come he can swear and I can't?

39:25.960 --> 39:28.358
Say what you want.
I don't care any more.

39:28.360 --> 39:32.360
Arse! Piss!
Big fuckin' hairy clagnuts!

39:35.120 --> 39:37.678
It's just rolls and stuff,
but I've got nothing in.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.518
Too busy driving you about,
I suppose.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.158
Yeah. You talk too much, Chesney.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.438
Oi. Watch the wheels, knobheads!

39:43.440 --> 39:44.958
They're shit wheels, anyway.
Get lost.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.398
Piss off!

39:46.400 --> 39:50.400
Yeah, little bastards!

39:50.720 --> 39:52.918
Dick.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.920
Kids, eh?

39:57.040 --> 40:00.518
In case you're wondering,
toilets are that way.

40:00.520 --> 40:04.520
Too late,
I've already pissed meself laughing.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.638
You get the drinks in
while I go for a slash.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.640
Yeah, I'd love to.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.998
All right, I admit,
I was jealous, paranoid.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.598
You can't blame me, though, can you?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.238
Er, I fucking can!

40:24.240 --> 40:28.240
I know, but it's just... I love you
and I don't want to lose you.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.958
I'm sorry.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.238
It's not me
you need to apologise to.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.678
I'll go see her, all right?

40:33.680 --> 40:35.358
No more undercover shite?

40:35.360 --> 40:38.158
No.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.758
Not like that, anyway.

40:41.760 --> 40:45.760
I've texted ahead, your passport's
ready and he knows you're coming.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.198
What do I call him -
Tariq or Muhammad?

40:49.200 --> 40:53.200
Call him fucking sir.
Then give him this.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.238
He's not doing it for love, is he?

40:57.240 --> 41:01.240
Two grand, and a little bit extra
till you get on your feet.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.798
Oh, Ramona, I can't!

41:03.800 --> 41:05.838
Look, it's me mum's money.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.958
And if she knew it meant
getting one over on that fucker

41:08.960 --> 41:12.960
she'd have approved.

41:14.320 --> 41:18.320
Now, come on, go get changed.
Hurry up, hurry up.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.678
Shane asked me to call,
apologise for last night.

41:22.680 --> 41:23.918
You don't have to.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.358
I wasn't going to.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.838
So, I will keep this simple -
stay away from him.

41:28.840 --> 41:32.398
You can't tell me what to do.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

41:32.400 --> 41:35.438
I'm a police officer. And unless
you want that lad of yours done

41:35.440 --> 41:39.440
for possession with intent to
supply, I'd remember that.

41:43.480 --> 41:44.678
Mum, you all right?

41:44.680 --> 41:48.318
Yeah, fine.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.278
Babe, I've got a something I want
to show you. Close your eyes.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.238
I'm not falling for that again.

41:53.240 --> 41:57.240
Just close your eyes.

41:58.640 --> 42:02.638
I don't fucking believe that.

42:02.640 --> 42:06.118
Right, I'm ready.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.798
What the fuck's that?

42:07.800 --> 42:10.158
It's you.
I got you tattooed on me arse.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.798
Is this some sort of a joke?

42:11.800 --> 42:13.198
Why, what's wrong?

42:13.200 --> 42:15.998
Well, for one, it looks like
Jabba the fucking Hutt!

42:16.000 --> 42:18.918
And two, it's on your arse.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.920
I did it for you,
to show you I love you.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.278
Over a hijab?!

42:32.280 --> 42:34.020
- It'll have to stay here.
- OK.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.398
Oh-h!

42:39.400 --> 42:41.798
I've put it in me jacket pocket.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.598
That's it!

42:43.600 --> 42:45.958
Does this mean
I need to get changed again?

42:45.960 --> 42:49.960
Right, forget it,
we've wasted enough time.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.598
You're back to being Mindy.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.118
Just, for some reason, you're
in a hijab and a roadkill jacket.

42:55.120 --> 42:59.120
Enjoy the cavity search. Right,
come on, you've got a plane to catch.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.038
You're not going anywhere.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.038
How long you been hiding here?

43:04.040 --> 43:05.958
Just since last night.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.398
This was how you thought you
were going to get away from me?

43:08.400 --> 43:10.078
Dressed up like one of her
fucking lot?

43:10.080 --> 43:11.798
Better than the state
you left her in!

43:11.800 --> 43:14.398
Shut it.

43:14.400 --> 43:17.078
You've made your point.
Now come home.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.558
She's not going anywhere with you.

43:19.560 --> 43:23.560
All right, all right, I'll come.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.078
What's going on?!

43:32.080 --> 43:33.318
I'm borrowing the car.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.478
I'm not talking about the fucking
car. Where are you taking her?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.358
It's all right, it's what I want.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.038
It's not going to happen!

43:39.040 --> 43:43.040
Honestly, Chesney, it's fine. Let's
go, Barry. Let's just go home.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.838
Get out of the car!

43:55.840 --> 43:58.318
Get off the bonnet, you mad bitch!

43:58.320 --> 44:00.718
I'm fine, Ramona. Really!

44:00.720 --> 44:02.718
Get fucked!

44:02.720 --> 44:04.518
Get off the bonnet, or else!

44:04.520 --> 44:08.398
Make me!

44:08.400 --> 44:12.400
Barry, calm down!

44:13.760 --> 44:15.638
I'm not moving.

44:15.640 --> 44:19.640
I'm not moving.

44:21.560 --> 44:24.798
Go on, Mindy!

44:24.800 --> 44:26.278
Stop!

44:26.280 --> 44:30.198
You're mine!

44:30.200 --> 44:31.598
I love you, Mindy.

44:31.600 --> 44:35.118
You can't leave me!

44:35.120 --> 44:38.118
How can you do this to me?

44:38.120 --> 44:40.078
You did this to yourself.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.478
You are a poisonous bitch.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.960
Oh, Dad?

44:48.080 --> 44:52.080
That's for earlier.

44:52.400 --> 44:56.400
And that's for Mum.

44:58.160 --> 45:02.160
'I remember seeing this psychiatrist
or psychologist on the telly once,

45:03.040 --> 45:06.518
'saying how love is just a chemical
high in the brain or something.

45:06.520 --> 45:10.438
'I can't remember the details.

45:10.440 --> 45:14.440
'But what I do know is that when you
love someone, and they love you...

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
'or even when they stop
loving you...

45:23.960 --> 45:27.718
'..you don't feel it in your brain.

45:27.720 --> 45:31.720
'You feel it in your heart.

45:32.280 --> 45:36.280
'When you think about it, love
can be a right pain in the arse.

45:37.720 --> 45:41.158
'But I'll tell you something...

45:41.160 --> 45:43.278
'you'll miss it when it's gone.'

45:43.280 --> 45:45.278
William here's sick of being
bone idle.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.518
What happened?

45:46.520 --> 45:48.238
- Thalia's a bully.
- What?

45:48.240 --> 45:50.838
- You are a terrible mother.
- No-one pays much attention to me.

45:50.840 --> 45:51.958
'You got a job?!'

45:51.960 --> 45:53.878
- I look like a salesman, don't I?
- So?

45:53.880 --> 45:55.518
So who's to know any different?

45:55.520 --> 45:57.798
If I tell her I'm a salesman,
I'm a salesman, aren't I?

45:57.800 --> 45:58.758
A car? How much?

45:58.760 --> 45:59.838
200 quid a week.

45:59.840 --> 46:00.998
You only make 150!

46:01.000 --> 46:03.960
- I've got to project an image
of success, haven't I?
- Drinks on Billy!

46:05.360 --> 46:08.204
You're fucked now, Billy-boy. You'll
have to rob a bank to keep this up.
