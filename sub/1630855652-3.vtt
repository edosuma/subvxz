WEBVTT

00:02.166 --> 00:03.375
Sabine.

00:03.375 --> 00:05.791
The droids. They took the map.

00:13.166 --> 00:16.375
This droid came here from Corellia.
<i>The New Republic shipyard?</i>

00:16.375 --> 00:19.708
Morgan Elsbeth had factories on Corellia.
Anyone check on that?

00:19.708 --> 00:21.416
<i>Welcome to the control center.</i>

00:21.416 --> 00:24.291
From here, we keep track
of the entire inventory being created

00:24.291 --> 00:26.250
from the dismantled Imperial Fleet.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.416
Is that a hyperdrive core?

00:27.416 --> 00:29.083
- Stop that ship.
- For the Empire!

00:38.458 --> 00:40.375
Have you kept up with your training?

00:40.375 --> 00:41.791
Obviously not.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.458
I have known many Padawans.

00:43.458 --> 00:46.958
Your aptitude for the Force
would fall short of them all.

00:46.958 --> 00:48.416
Thanks.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.625
Transport CT-05, stand down
and return to port immediately.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.875
We got a tracking device
on that transport.

00:56.875 --> 00:59.583
<i>The transport was traced
to the Denab system,</i>

00:59.583 --> 01:01.333
<i>around the planet Seatos.</i>

01:01.333 --> 01:05.000
Anakin never got to finish my training.
I walked away from him.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.916
Just like I walked away from Sabine.

01:06.916 --> 01:09.125
<i>I was wondering
if you would consider</i>

01:09.125 --> 01:11.000
<i>bringing her back on as your apprentice.</i>

01:11.000 --> 01:12.375
I'm ready.

01:12.375 --> 01:13.458
Take us out.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.208
Padawan.

01:53.125 --> 01:56.083
Kee-ray. Guy-kee. Kee-ray.

01:57.166 --> 02:00.583
Kee-say. Kee-ray. Guy-kee.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.291
Kee-say. Set.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.916
Kee-ray. Kee-say. Guy-kee.

02:08.583 --> 02:12.041
Kee-say. Kee-ray. Guy-kee.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.833
Guy-kee. Set.

02:14.666 --> 02:15.791
Yo-kee.

02:17.708 --> 02:18.708
Yah-tay.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.250
Well?

02:22.041 --> 02:24.208
Not bad.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.166
But not good.

02:27.375 --> 02:28.500
It's been a while.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.583
Obviously.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.541
I see you still remember the basics.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.458
Enough to get by.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.458
Mmm, barely.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.708
Huyang, let's try something else.

02:41.208 --> 02:42.375
How about Zatochi?

02:42.375 --> 02:43.458
Oh, no.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.750
I'm not certain
Lady Wren is ready for that technique.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.166
Thank you, Huyang.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.083
Yes. Thank you, Huyang.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.166
Your skill with a weapon comes
from your Mandalorian upbringing.

02:56.166 --> 02:59.250
Those skills alone will not be enough
to defeat our enemy.

03:00.125 --> 03:02.166
Yeah, I learned that the hard way.

03:02.875 --> 03:06.666
You're training the body,
but you must also open your mind.

03:08.791 --> 03:11.583
Learning to wield the Force
takes a deeper commitment.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.041
How?

03:17.416 --> 03:19.166
That's something you'll have to discover.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.541
Well, I discovered
that according to Huyang,

03:21.541 --> 03:25.875
I'm the worst candidate to be a Jedi
out of every Jedi he's ever known.

03:25.875 --> 03:26.958
You told her that?

03:26.958 --> 03:28.291
It's true.

03:30.708 --> 03:33.083
It doesn't matter.
- I think it does.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.166
Agreed.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.666
Here, put this on.

03:39.791 --> 03:40.791
You're joking.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.041
I can't see. How am I supposed to fight?

03:53.125 --> 03:55.541
I want you to see
with more than just your eyes.

03:58.833 --> 04:00.958
Okay, now what?

04:03.208 --> 04:04.333
Be still.

04:05.583 --> 04:06.708
Listen to my voice.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.083
Do you know where I am?

04:16.791 --> 04:18.208
Next to Huyang.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.291
Are you sure?

04:21.166 --> 04:22.166
Very funny.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.250
You'd be dead.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.541
Not if I could see you.

04:26.541 --> 04:27.875
Exactly.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.041
Now, lower your visor and concentrate.

04:32.375 --> 04:33.375
Ready position.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.250
Feel my presence.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.625
Take in all that is around you.

04:45.958 --> 04:47.000
Follow my voice.

04:49.958 --> 04:51.416
Sense my intention.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.916
Anger and frustration
are quick to give power.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.500
But they also unbalance you.

06:42.583 --> 06:43.666
Let's go again.

07:19.125 --> 07:20.125
The Chancellor?

07:20.125 --> 07:22.708
She's waiting.
There are several Senators with her.

07:23.333 --> 07:24.625
One of them is Xiono.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.666
Chancellor Mothma, Senators.

07:33.666 --> 07:36.791
<i>Hera, you look well. How's young Jacen?</i>

07:37.416 --> 07:39.916
Fine, Chancellor, in fact he's on board.

07:40.958 --> 07:41.958
Somewhere.

07:41.958 --> 07:45.375
<i>Causing trouble
with Chopper, no doubt.</i>

07:45.375 --> 07:48.125
Most likely.
<i>Forgive me, Madam Chancellor,</i>

07:48.125 --> 07:51.750
<i>but if we could just hear
the General's report. We're late as it is.</i>

07:51.750 --> 07:53.458
<i>Quite right, Senator Xiono.</i>

07:54.833 --> 07:55.833
<i>Hera?</i>

07:57.583 --> 07:59.875
My investigation into the attack
on the <i>Vesper</i>

07:59.875 --> 08:02.750
led me to the Santhe Shipyards on Corellia

08:02.750 --> 08:07.375
where I was attacked by Imperial loyalists
still working for Morgan Elsbeth.

08:07.375 --> 08:08.958
<i>Outliers.</i>

08:08.958 --> 08:13.041
<i>We have former Imperials
working throughout every level</i>

08:13.041 --> 08:17.375
<i>of the New Republic government,
and they've all taken oaths of loyalty.</i>

08:17.375 --> 08:21.583
"Long Live the Empire" doesn't sound like
the kind of loyalty we're looking for.

08:23.916 --> 08:27.041
<i>It was my understanding
that the offenders were arrested</i>

08:27.041 --> 08:30.166
<i>and the facility shut down
pending further investigation.</i>

08:30.166 --> 08:33.666
Yes, but I believe their activity
speaks to a larger operation.

08:33.666 --> 08:34.750
<i>It always does.</i>

08:35.541 --> 08:37.125
Involving Thrawn.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.666
<i>Grand Admiral Thrawn?</i>

08:43.750 --> 08:46.333
<i>But how is that possible?
He disappeared years ago.</i>

08:46.875 --> 08:48.958
I have reason to believe he is alive.

08:49.666 --> 08:52.291
And that his allies are working
on a way to find him.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.250
<i>You are certain of this?</i>

08:56.958 --> 08:59.041
If I could get approval
to send a task force

08:59.041 --> 09:01.333
to the Denab system, I could find out.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.541
<i>General, be honest.</i>

09:03.541 --> 09:07.250
<i>Isn't this just another attempt
to gain New Republic resources</i>

09:07.250 --> 09:09.541
<i>to aid in what has ultimately been</i>

09:09.541 --> 09:12.250
<i>your personal quest to find Ezra Bridger?</i>

09:12.250 --> 09:14.541
Ezra vanished while fighting Thrawn...

09:14.541 --> 09:17.541
<i>And that you conveniently use
the threat of Thrawn's return</i>

09:17.541 --> 09:21.916
<i>to acquire those resources that could be
put to a more practical purpose,</i>

09:21.916 --> 09:24.708
<i>helping the people
of our fledgling Republic.</i>

09:26.416 --> 09:28.125
Were you ever in the war, Senator?

09:31.458 --> 09:32.583
<i>No.</i>

09:35.375 --> 09:37.666
Just sat back and waited to see
who came out on top?

09:45.791 --> 09:48.833
<i>General Syndulla,
I'm sure we are all grateful</i>

09:48.833 --> 09:51.500
<i>for your service and role
in restoring the Republic.</i>

09:51.500 --> 09:54.625
<i>Now we, as Senators,
serve the people of that Republic</i>

09:54.625 --> 09:57.875
<i>and I can tell you they want no part
of any further conflict.</i>

09:57.875 --> 09:59.666
You act like we have a choice.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.750
<i>Don't we?</i>

10:02.083 --> 10:05.583
<i>I see no enemy. The Imperial Fleet
is scattered and broken.</i>

10:05.583 --> 10:07.500
<i>They have no centralized command.</i>

10:07.500 --> 10:08.916
Unless Thrawn returns.

10:08.916 --> 10:10.916
<i>Make your point, General.</i>

10:13.000 --> 10:15.208
Thrawn is not your typical
Imperial officer.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.291
I know because I fought against him.

10:21.958 --> 10:24.583
He killed friends,
people who were like family to me.

10:26.916 --> 10:28.708
I've spent most of my life fighting a war

10:28.708 --> 10:32.791
and that's why I'm trying to convince you
to help me prevent another one.

10:32.791 --> 10:35.833
<i>Grand Admiral Thrawn is dead,</i>

10:35.833 --> 10:37.541
<i>and I'm sorry to say it is my opinion</i>

10:37.541 --> 10:40.208
<i>that your friend, Ezra Bridger,
heroically died with him.</i>

10:40.208 --> 10:42.500
You don't know that... <i>General.</i>

10:43.416 --> 10:44.416
<i>Hera.</i>

10:45.916 --> 10:48.458
<i>Allow me a moment
to speak with my colleagues.</i>

10:51.666 --> 10:52.666
Of course.

10:53.875 --> 10:54.875
Chancellor.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.291
Senators.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.500
That went well.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.250
Hey, Mom! Mom!

11:11.375 --> 11:13.291
Is it true Aunt Sabine is gonna be a Jedi?

11:13.291 --> 11:14.958
Now, where did you hear that?

11:14.958 --> 11:16.083
Chopper told me.

11:21.666 --> 11:22.875
I wanna be a Jedi.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.500
Yeah, I know you do, Jacen.

11:32.875 --> 11:33.875
You did well today.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.375
Then again,
you were always a fast learner.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.208
Well, like you said, weapons I can handle.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.916
It's the rest of it that's a struggle.

11:45.583 --> 11:46.666
Always has been.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.666
It takes time.

11:51.291 --> 11:52.750
I know. I just...

11:53.708 --> 11:54.708
I was...

11:57.458 --> 12:00.208
I was hoping that the urgency
of our situation could...

12:01.500 --> 12:02.875
expedite my training a bit?

12:05.875 --> 12:07.791
I'm afraid it doesn't work like that.

12:08.708 --> 12:09.833
I know. I just...

12:11.833 --> 12:13.333
I can't use the Force.

12:15.083 --> 12:17.083
I don't feel it.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.000
Not like you do.

12:21.916 --> 12:24.166
The Force resides in all living things.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.250
Even you.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.541
If that's true,
then why doesn't everyone use it?

12:33.166 --> 12:34.416
Talent is a factor.

12:39.208 --> 12:42.791
But training and focus
are what truly define someone's success.

12:51.791 --> 12:54.666
Not everyone can handle
the type of discipline it takes

12:54.666 --> 12:56.375
to master the ways of the Force.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.916
Start small.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.833
Ahsoka.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.958
I'm going to give this my best.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.250
Any word from Hera
about our support from the New Republic?

13:34.250 --> 13:35.833
No, not yet.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.416
So, what do you think of her progress?

13:42.375 --> 13:43.416
She's frustrated.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.791
It's still a challenge for her.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.041
You both knew this wouldn't be easy.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.416
Well, what you said didn't help.

13:51.416 --> 13:53.416
I only spoke the truth.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.625
The Jedi Order
would not have accepted her.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.583
She is not an acceptable candidate.

13:58.416 --> 13:59.541
By their standards.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.833
Standards which were proven
over a millennium.

14:03.416 --> 14:04.500
And failed.

14:04.500 --> 14:08.000
You realize, historically,
there have been very few Mandalorians

14:08.000 --> 14:09.416
who ever became a Jedi.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.416
I don't need Sabine to be a Jedi.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.666
I need her to be herself.

14:14.666 --> 14:20.333
Well, I suppose you do come
from a long line of non-traditional Jedi.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.833
In that way, she fits right in.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.125
The Force is in all of us.

15:06.875 --> 15:09.083
<i>Sabine,
I've got Hera.</i>

15:14.166 --> 15:15.375
You win this round.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.875
Hera! Great. How far out
are you and the fleet?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.541
<i>Unfortunately,
I won't be joining you for this one.</i>

15:34.541 --> 15:35.958
<i>And neither will the fleet.</i>

15:36.958 --> 15:37.958
What?

15:37.958 --> 15:40.291
<i>The Senate Committee
wouldn't approve the mission.</i>

15:40.291 --> 15:43.583
The Senate Committee?
What are you talking about?

15:43.583 --> 15:46.666
<i>I'm sorry, Sabine, but it's not up to me,</i>

15:46.666 --> 15:48.875
<i>- I have to follow the orders--</i>
- Hera?

15:48.875 --> 15:50.291
Huyang, what's happened?

15:50.291 --> 15:54.208
We've entered the Denab system,
all comm transmissions are being jammed.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.833
Drop from hyperspace.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.625
Let's see what Morgan's
been hiding out here.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.500
Why'd we drop out of hyperspace
so far from the planet?

16:12.500 --> 16:16.000
Standard Jedi mission protocol
when approaching an unknown situation.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.375
In order to avoid enemy surveillance--

16:18.375 --> 16:19.750
He's still doing this?

16:19.750 --> 16:20.875
Programming.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.166
Right.

16:23.166 --> 16:25.541
In any case, my last scan indicates

16:25.541 --> 16:28.750
the transport was in orbit
on the far side of the planet.

16:28.750 --> 16:32.875
However, there also seems to be
a second object. Something much larger.

16:33.416 --> 16:34.666
A Star Destroyer?

16:34.666 --> 16:38.083
Negative. Whatever it is has a signature
which is unknown to me.

16:59.708 --> 17:02.083
I am tracking two squadrons
of three crafts.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.541
- Tail gun, please.
- On it.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.833
<i>Tail gun check-in.</i>

17:15.833 --> 17:17.666
I see you got rid of my presets.

17:17.666 --> 17:19.000
I never needed them.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.166
So you say.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.333
<i>- Tail gun ready.</i>
- Copy that.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.458
Two and three, close range and engage.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.083
Hey! Hold it steady.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.500
Remember, learn to anticipate.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.208
- Now's not the time for a lesson.
- You're just a little rusty.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.666
- Huyang, anything yet?
- On the object? No.

18:01.666 --> 18:04.458
However, I have several thoughts
on everything else going on.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.541
Huyang, not now.

18:05.541 --> 18:08.000
The way you're both acting,
there won't be a later.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.333
Sabine. Tell me what you need.

18:25.416 --> 18:26.500
Move on my signal?

18:27.083 --> 18:28.083
<i>Copy.</i>

18:29.250 --> 18:31.000
All right. Get ready.

18:31.750 --> 18:32.750
Ready.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.875
Come on, come on.

18:42.625 --> 18:43.750
Dive.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.375
Missed. I had them but missed.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.458
Don't worry about it,
you'll get another chance.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.333
We got two more incoming. Dead ahead.

19:05.958 --> 19:07.875
- I'm gonna split them. Ready?
- Ready.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.458
Now!

19:14.625 --> 19:16.166
Whoo! I got one!

19:16.166 --> 19:17.583
Good work.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.333
Two-Six, with me.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.500
- They're forming up.
- Let's roll them.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.416
<i>Copy that. On my mark?</i>

19:31.958 --> 19:33.208
Tell me when.

19:37.416 --> 19:38.666
Port, now!

19:44.791 --> 19:46.000
Two more down!

19:46.541 --> 19:48.000
Huyang, anything?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.458
We should be able to make
visual confirmation...

19:51.291 --> 19:52.291
Now.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.250
If I had to guess,

19:59.250 --> 20:01.500
I would say it is some sort
of hyperspace ring.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
I'd like to confirm that.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.541
Morgan, they're entering your sector.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.750
I'm surprised you let them get this far.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.833
Stay clear, I shall deal with them.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.666
Prepare turbolasers.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.583
Marrok, form up on my wing
and wait for my signal.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.250
<i>As you wish.</i>

20:38.500 --> 20:39.875
Fighters have broken off.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.500
- You better get up here.
<i>- Copy.</i>

20:42.541 --> 20:45.416
Just keep the ship steady
while I attempt to run my scan.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.291
<i>Turbolasers primed and ready.</i>

20:52.291 --> 20:53.875
Open fire.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.875
I am starting to receive data.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.208
Manage the deflectors.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.708
Copy.

21:11.166 --> 21:14.791
How interesting.
I would never have guessed that.

21:14.791 --> 21:16.666
- Get everything you need?
- Not yet.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.000
See if you can get
a little closer.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.166
Are you cross-wired?
- Closer, please.

21:38.291 --> 21:41.666
Steady, steady! This is intolerable.

21:41.666 --> 21:43.083
You wanted closer.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.625
Deflectors at 10%.

21:53.750 --> 21:54.875
Huyang?

21:54.875 --> 21:57.666
Just a moment. Just a moment.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.208
Scan complete.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.250
Destroyed?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.500
They are off our scope.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.583
Huyang? Huyang's down.

22:25.541 --> 22:27.875
Leave him, I need you to run
a full diagnostic.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.541
- Leave him?
- Prioritize, Sabine.

22:29.541 --> 22:31.625
We can't help Huyang if we're both dead.

22:31.625 --> 22:32.750
Now, get on it.

22:32.750 --> 22:33.833
Come on!

22:37.625 --> 22:40.166
<i>Morgan, congratulations.</i>

22:41.583 --> 22:42.750
You almost got them.

22:44.541 --> 22:45.750
<i>I have eyes on them.</i>

22:46.708 --> 22:47.958
<i>We'll take it from here.</i>

22:51.791 --> 22:52.791
What's working?

22:52.791 --> 22:55.625
Not much. Our backup kicked in,
but we're dead in space.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.875
- No hyperdrive, no cannons.
- We have incoming.

22:59.791 --> 23:01.458
Work fast, I'm going out there.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.250
"Out there"? Out where?

23:03.250 --> 23:05.291
Just keep working. I'll distract them.

23:13.458 --> 23:14.500
We have them.

23:18.583 --> 23:19.666
Come on!

23:19.666 --> 23:21.625
I hope you know what you're doing!

23:43.958 --> 23:45.291
She's on the wing.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.500
I see her.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.666
Come on!

23:58.000 --> 24:00.166
The one time I could use your advice.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.083
Ahsoka...

24:15.791 --> 24:19.000
<i>Sabine, did you fix the ship yet?</i>

24:19.000 --> 24:20.083
Okay.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.791
Okay.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.333
I got it! I got it!

24:28.333 --> 24:30.250
<i>That's great. Now get me.</i>

24:34.250 --> 24:35.958
Get ready.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.625
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

24:53.958 --> 24:56.666
Nice trick. Got any more?

24:56.666 --> 24:57.750
Buckle up.

25:16.833 --> 25:18.458
I'm tracking something up ahead.

25:18.958 --> 25:19.958
Another ship?

25:21.833 --> 25:22.916
No.

25:23.916 --> 25:24.916
What? What is it?

26:42.333 --> 26:43.750
I've got an opening.

27:03.583 --> 27:04.708
Where are they?

27:15.791 --> 27:17.666
That won't lose them for long.

27:19.041 --> 27:21.916
We're in pretty bad shape.
Better set us down.

27:21.916 --> 27:25.416
Scan complete!

27:26.000 --> 27:29.500
Oh. Took my battery backup
a while to cycle, I suppose.

27:29.500 --> 27:30.583
What did I miss?

27:31.083 --> 27:32.666
We almost died.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.000
Multiple times.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.125
Ah, yes. Standard operating procedure.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.416
Shut the power down.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.416
I protest. I have a lot of work to do.

28:06.416 --> 28:07.958
Standard Jedi protocol.

28:07.958 --> 28:10.500
- I suppose that's true...
- Shutting down.

28:42.291 --> 28:43.583
<i>Any sign of them?</i>

28:43.583 --> 28:44.791
<i>Nothing.</i>

28:45.666 --> 28:48.833
<i>They must be hiding in the forest.
Let's regroup.</i>

29:01.625 --> 29:02.833
Think we can chance it?

29:09.333 --> 29:10.416
Thank you.

29:24.375 --> 29:25.500
Are you all right?

29:26.583 --> 29:29.625
I haven't seen those creatures
since the day Ezra disappeared.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.083
Anything interesting?

29:37.291 --> 29:38.291
Indeed.

29:39.083 --> 29:42.125
The good news is the enemy vessel
is still under construction

29:42.125 --> 29:43.666
and not yet complete.

29:43.666 --> 29:45.958
There are six hyperdrive engines in place

29:45.958 --> 29:48.625
with the final one
being set into position.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.208
So, it is a hyperspace ring?

29:50.208 --> 29:54.166
Yes. But I have never seen one
built on this scale before.

29:54.166 --> 29:57.166
A craft with these power levels
and configuration

29:57.166 --> 30:01.708
would be capable of a hyperspace jump
of astonishing speed and distance.

30:01.708 --> 30:04.750
Huyang, could a ring like that
make a jump to a neighboring galaxy?

30:04.750 --> 30:07.708
Theoretically, if one knew
the coordinates and navigation,

30:07.708 --> 30:09.500
yes, I believe it could.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.791
The Jedi archives speak
of intergalactic hyperspace lanes

30:12.791 --> 30:15.958
between galaxies which used to follow
the migration paths

30:15.958 --> 30:18.125
of star whales named purrgil.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.541
Like the ones we just saw.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.125
Really? When?

30:38.541 --> 30:40.625
The Jedi have taken refuge in the forest.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.208
Hunt them down.
