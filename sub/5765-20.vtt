00:01.300 --> 00:03.222
Previously on The Good Wife:
I found the receipt,

00:03.270 --> 00:04.089
but it's not under Florrick.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.291
Could the name be Kozko?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.194
If you accidentally
cross the line...

00:08.240 --> 00:09.605
(alarm wailing)
then you'll receive
a telephone call

00:09.640 --> 00:11.301
from our monitoring center.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.479
You need to answer that
call within five rings

00:13.510 --> 00:14.704
or you're terminated
from the program.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.776
Do you understand?
I understand.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.346
ALICIA:
It's over.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.472
PETER:
What is?

00:21.520 --> 00:22.782
Us. Me caring.

00:22.820 --> 00:26.051
Me actually thinking
that you're changing.

00:26.090 --> 00:27.250
I am changing.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.087
No, you're not.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.552
GRACE:
They're fighting?
ALICIA: You
want to think you are

00:30.590 --> 00:31.750
so you can go back

00:31.790 --> 00:33.758
to what you did before.
PETER:
Then help me.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.620
Mom's leaving?

00:35.660 --> 00:37.594
I don't know.

00:37.630 --> 00:39.097
PETER:
Help me.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.096
If you're right,
help me.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.664
They're going to divorce.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.564
No.
We don't know that.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.176
Mom just left.

00:48.210 --> 00:51.179
She just walked out the door.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.575
We're going to be okay.

00:52.620 --> 00:56.386
I was liking
having Dad back, too.

00:56.420 --> 00:59.412
Just like before.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.057
(alarm wailing)

01:07.130 --> 01:09.121
Dad?

01:27.180 --> 01:29.182
(phone rings)

01:31.390 --> 01:33.415
WILL:
Hey. I just moved
Hi.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.884
the reservation at
the National Cafe in 40 minutes.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.227
If that's all right.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.228
You sure?
It's all right.

01:40.260 --> 01:42.797
Yeah, I'm trying to be
spontaneous these days.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.798
Okay. I'll see you then.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.139
Okay?

01:47.170 --> 01:49.161
Okay.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.354
Peter, no!

02:06.390 --> 02:06.879
You...

02:06.920 --> 02:08.353
I love you.

02:08.390 --> 02:11.154
You can't be down here!

02:11.190 --> 02:13.158
Please.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.191
Don't leave me.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.562
You have to be upstairs, Peter.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.760
I can't lose you.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.835
I can't lose Zach.
I can't lose Grace.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.497
Daniel, Daniel Golden.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.360
Tell him it's an emergency!

02:23.410 --> 02:24.809
Peter's going to be arrested
in 20 minutes.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.829
GRACE:
Dad?

02:25.870 --> 02:27.872
(alarm wailing)

02:30.250 --> 02:32.218
Dad?

02:32.250 --> 02:35.174
(doorbell rings)
MAN:
Hey, Zach? Grace?

02:35.220 --> 02:36.812
Is everything all right?

02:36.850 --> 02:38.488
My mom's getting complaints
from the tenants.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.818
(phone rings)

02:40.860 --> 02:42.851
It's the police.
No, Zach, don't!

02:42.890 --> 02:44.824
We have five rings
or Dad's going to prison.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.418
Dad has to answer.

02:46.460 --> 02:48.394
We'll say we're getting him.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.421
(ringing continues)
That's four rings.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.329
Hello?

02:55.370 --> 02:56.962
This is Sergeant Thacker
at HMD Center.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.307
Please identify yourself.

02:58.340 --> 02:59.477
This is Grace.

02:59.510 --> 03:00.875
Grace Florrick.

03:00.910 --> 03:03.208
We've received an alert
there's been an unauthorized

03:03.250 --> 03:04.399
breach of the perimeter.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.418
Please put Mr. Florrick
on the line.

03:06.450 --> 03:08.441
That's my dad. Um...

03:08.480 --> 03:09.481
Please put your father
on the line.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.316
I need to speak to him now.

03:10.350 --> 03:11.908
Okay, hold one minute.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.952
I'm going to go get him.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.981
Say he's in the shower.
I'll go downstairs.

03:16.020 --> 03:16.782
No.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.503
Dad, there's someone here
for you.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.548
He's in the shower.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.014
Um_... he'll be out
In a minute.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.711
He's not there, is he?
No, he's here.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.388
He's-he's just in the shower.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.682
He's rushing.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.744
This is my last request for you

03:45.790 --> 03:47.018
to put Mr. Florrick
on the phone.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.518
Dad, they need you right now.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.551
(dial tone drones)

03:54.030 --> 03:56.260
They're going to take Dad.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.292
(alarm continues wailing)

04:12.750 --> 04:13.876
Watch out.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.740
(alarm continues wailing)

04:19.020 --> 04:21.989
(alarm stops wailing)

04:29.500 --> 04:30.797
(groans)

04:31.830 --> 04:34.833
What do we do, Peter?

04:35.840 --> 04:38.832
You're going
back to jail.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.501
I know.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.438
(phone rings)

04:45.480 --> 04:46.469
Hello?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.511
(elevator bell dings)

04:49.990 --> 04:51.981
PETER:
Zach!

04:52.020 --> 04:53.317
Zach!

04:53.990 --> 04:55.787
What happened?

04:55.820 --> 04:57.583
It's my arm.
Where?

04:57.630 --> 04:58.858
I was skateboarding.
GRACE:
No, he's here.

04:58.890 --> 05:00.494
My dad's right here.

05:00.530 --> 05:01.690
GRACE:
No, it was a skateboard.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.095
It's okay.
I got you.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.018
No, he never left.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.935
My dad's
with my brother.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.460
He's bleeding.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.728
(whispering):
Grace, what are you doing?

05:11.770 --> 05:13.931
Keeping Dad.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.973
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

05:24.520 --> 05:27.614
(indistinct radio transmission)

05:29.760 --> 05:31.648
SHERIFF:
So, that's what happened?

05:31.690 --> 05:33.521
Your brother made this move
on his board...

05:33.560 --> 05:35.551
(continues indistinctly)

05:36.500 --> 05:37.569
SHERIFF: All right,
well, I appreciate...

05:37.600 --> 05:39.693
Thank you.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.436
Now I'm going
to talk to you.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.062
It's Amal, right?

05:44.110 --> 05:45.634
Amal.
Yeah.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.570
Now, when you first arrived
at the apartment,

05:47.610 --> 05:50.477
did you, uh, see
Mr. Florrick?

05:51.950 --> 05:53.076
Yes.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.473
You're sure.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.488
Yeah, he just, uh,
got out of the shower.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.488
Mm-hmm.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.818
Now, your mother is
the building manager?

06:00.860 --> 06:02.157
Yes, uh,

06:02.190 --> 06:04.158
on the fourth floor.
I came up because, um,

06:04.190 --> 06:06.658
we got some complaints
about the noise.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.053
Do you have some I.D.?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.398
Yeah, I probably
have something.

06:11.630 --> 06:13.393
SHERIFF:
A current driver's license...

06:13.440 --> 06:14.896
What were you thinking?

06:14.940 --> 06:16.669
They were going to arrest Dad.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.530
(camera shutter clicking)

06:18.570 --> 06:21.573
Um... hello.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.749
These are beautiful bookcases.

06:23.780 --> 06:24.849
Are you with
the police?

06:24.880 --> 06:25.904
Mrs. Florrick,
your daughter

06:25.950 --> 06:27.918
said the HMD
sent a false positive,

06:27.950 --> 06:31.818
because your son was...
attempting a crooked grind

06:31.850 --> 06:33.818
and slammed into it.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.509
Sheriff, she's
just a kid.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.959
Meaning what?

06:36.990 --> 06:38.981
She's lying?
Uh, Sheriff,

06:39.030 --> 06:40.156
ifI could interrupt.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.156
Good evening,
first of all.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.065
I'm going to ask
Mr. and Mrs. Florrick

06:44.100 --> 06:46.432
not to answer any more
of your questions.

06:46.470 --> 06:49.189
Uh, Mrs. Florrick,
I'm Daniel Golden's partner.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.437
And I ask that all questions
be directed through me.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.607
Well, I could take Mr. Florrick
in right now.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.074
Yes, and where was Mr. Florrick
when you arrived?

06:57.110 --> 07:00.671
Um... he failed to
answer his HMD call.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.608
Due to the fact
that his son was injured

07:02.650 --> 07:04.186
in a skateboarding accident.

07:04.220 --> 07:06.188
Again, where did you find
Mr. Florrick?

07:06.220 --> 07:07.619
SHERIFF: Excuse me,
we received a warning

07:07.660 --> 07:09.480
that the perimeter
had been breached.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.781
Due to a malfunctioning unit.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.128
You found Mr. Florrick
in his apartment.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.525
'Cause he returned.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.664
Or never left.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.168
Hey, who installed
the HMD unit?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.667
SHERIFF:
Who installed it?

07:20.700 --> 07:22.600
I did. Why?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.665
Do you know
what an OHS clip is?

07:24.710 --> 07:28.032
An itty-bitty wire clip
about this big.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.674
It's required
by the sheriff's department

07:30.710 --> 07:31.904
whenever an HMD
is installed.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.679
One clip for every

07:33.720 --> 07:34.618
one foot of wire.

07:34.650 --> 07:36.743
Do you know how much wire
you installed?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.883
Who are you?

07:38.920 --> 07:41.559
Elsbeth Tascioni.

07:41.590 --> 07:42.750
Hi.

07:42.790 --> 07:45.224
You installed, by my eye,
three feet of wire.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.626
And do you know how many
OHS clips you installed?

07:47.660 --> 07:49.059
None.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.625
People don't like permanent
fixtures in their houses.

07:51.670 --> 07:55.993
Well, that's very kind of you,
Sheriff.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.667
But it's still
an Infraction.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.734
And unfortunately
mmswm,

07:58.770 --> 08:01.603
your loose wire
is what tripped up

08:01.640 --> 08:04.473
young Mr. Florrick's skateboard
causing his injury.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.783
Thank you.
You know,

08:14.820 --> 08:17.789
I wish I had an eye with color.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.649
(chuckles)

08:18.690 --> 08:21.227
I'm always mixing
oranges with reds.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.761
(phone buzzing)
Is that you?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.222
Is that...

08:28.100 --> 08:30.807
Will.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.535
Hey. Is everything all right?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.536
I'm so sorry.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.229
It's been such chaos
around here.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.601
It's okay.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.015
We'll talk tomorrow.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.018
(gentle music plays
in background)

08:45.990 --> 08:47.981
(quiet, indistinct
conversations)

08:58.800 --> 09:00.791
(line ringing)

09:04.810 --> 09:06.232
Hey, Sadie.

09:06.270 --> 09:09.239
Sorry for flaking out
on you tonight.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.249
No, my emergency fell through.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.248
Do you want to...

09:14.280 --> 09:15.975
What favor?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.808
(elevator bell dings)

09:38.840 --> 09:41.832
(indistinct radio transmission)

09:55.860 --> 09:58.624
What's wrong?

10:00.430 --> 10:02.625
We're not going
toward your floor.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.593
(elevator bell dings)

10:27.020 --> 10:29.056
(elevator bell dings)

10:35.360 --> 10:37.328

10:37.370 --> 10:39.258

10:39.300 --> 10:41.291
MAN:
What we have here
is a rather large

10:41.340 --> 10:43.968
_ collection of items
With your name on them.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.001
You don't need
to be nervous.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.031
I'm your friend here.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.775
They aren't mine.

10:49.810 --> 10:50.845
Really.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.145
Look, the sheriff ran your ID.
last night, Amal.

10:54.180 --> 10:57.843
It triggered a red flag
warning to me.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.814
You see, there are a dozen
credit cards,

11:00.860 --> 11:03.954
driver's licenses, passports
with your name on 'em.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.981
You know how that
could've happened?

11:06.030 --> 11:09.227
No. I don't.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.969
(dishes clattering)
MAN: Were you paid to let
someone use your identity?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.194
Simran?
MAN: _
Are you certain?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.730
Oh.

11:15.770 --> 11:16.964
Is everything okay?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.331
Yes, Alicia.
Um, they just...

11:19.370 --> 11:22.407
they have a few questions,
um, for Amal.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.305
It's about work.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.875
Do you... do you want
me to do anything?

11:26.920 --> 11:27.909
Oh. No.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.144
I don't know.

11:29.180 --> 11:32.343
They said it would only
take a minute, and so...

11:32.390 --> 11:34.415
Amal isn't in trouble.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.451
MAN:
You don't want
to get In trouble, Amal.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.822
No.
Then why aren't you
answering honestly?

11:41.860 --> 11:43.191
I am answering
honestly.

11:43.230 --> 11:45.061
I don't know
anything about this.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.260
I swear.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.961
Excuse me, gentlemen.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.770
Is Amal a suspect here?

11:53.810 --> 11:56.404
Because if so, you probably
should read him his rights.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.203
Not a suspect...
at this time.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.070
We're asking a few questions.
That's all.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.441
Mrs. Florrick, isn't it?

12:02.480 --> 12:04.186
Y-Yes.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.847
You just accused him
of being dishonest,

12:05.890 --> 12:07.949
and warned him he
could get into trouble.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.878
We're trying to ascertain
his connection

12:09.930 --> 12:11.056
to an identity theft ring.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.092
Mm-hmm.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.757
Simran,

12:14.800 --> 12:16.995
I think you should invite
these gentlemen to leave.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.099
We only need a few

12:18.130 --> 12:19.893
more minutes,
Mrs. Verma.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.362
If you don't want them here,
you can ask them to leave,

12:21.400 --> 12:23.402
Simran.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.372
Gentlemen...

12:28.410 --> 12:30.401
would you please leave?

12:36.990 --> 12:39.379
My guess is
they're just fishing.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.819
(sighs)

12:41.860 --> 12:43.919
Look, I-I didn't do
anything wrong, Mom.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.428
I swear.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.325
ALICIA:
I have to rush to work,

12:48.360 --> 12:51.397
but if you need anything,
just call me, okay?

12:51.430 --> 12:53.489
Thank you, Alicia.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.030
Of course.

12:57.070 --> 12:58.230
Does he have a moment?

12:58.270 --> 12:59.828
Actually,
Will's out today.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.029
He's... Oh, court?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.104
No, volunteer work.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.277
All very
last minute.

13:03.310 --> 13:04.447
He's out until
Thursday.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.072
Thursday?

13:06.110 --> 13:08.169
So this is
the favor?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.983
For an old college chum.

13:10.020 --> 13:10.941
Very hot.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.116
That's right.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.879
You have a thing
for judges.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.057
My first husband.

13:15.090 --> 13:16.455
It's not half bad.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.549
I wonder_if I can
get It fitted.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.990
(laughs)

13:21.030 --> 13:22.292
Objection, Your Honor.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.592
Uh, calls for speculation.

13:23.630 --> 13:26.269
The question asks Mr. Hunter
to guess the answer

13:26.300 --> 13:27.836
rather than rely on facts.

13:27.870 --> 13:29.838
Yes, that is the
definition of speculation.

13:29.870 --> 13:30.939
Congratulations,
Mr. Bigelow.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.870
Too bad I
didn't do that.

13:32.910 --> 13:33.934
Sustained.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.038
Exception.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.174
Noted, and when you go
to mock trial appeal court,

13:38.210 --> 13:40.417
Ms. Cabrini, you
can argue it there.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.872
(laughter)

13:41.920 --> 13:44.047
CABRINI:
Now, Mr. Hunter,

13:44.090 --> 13:46.285
I just want to understand
the sequence of events.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.459
You say that you saw my clients
entering the cottage?

13:48.490 --> 13:51.027
Yes. I was hunting in the
forest when I heard a scream.

13:51.060 --> 13:53.028
Actually,
you said "screams"?

13:53.060 --> 13:54.550
Yes. Screams.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.967
And you said that you recognize
those as belonging to the witch?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.558
That's right. She lives
in that gingerbread house.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.397
Oh. So you just assumed

14:01.440 --> 14:04.967
that_it was the witch's scream
coming from made the oven?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.978
(phone buzzing)
No. I recognized
her voice.

14:07.010 --> 14:08.409
Oh.
So you have the power

14:08.440 --> 14:11.648
to distinguish
between screams?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.011
Well, how about this one?

14:13.050 --> 14:13.971
(screaming)

14:14.020 --> 14:15.009
Objection! Your Honor!

14:15.050 --> 14:16.881
Ms. Cabrini!

14:16.920 --> 14:18.319
Sustained.
Sustained, what?

14:18.350 --> 14:21.080
What's the objection?

14:21.120 --> 14:23.122
Badgering the witness.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.378
You're arguing the prosecution's
case, Your Honor.

14:25.430 --> 14:26.988
Excuse me,
Ms. Cabrini.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.055
I am not doing anything
of the sort.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.965
Okay, let's leave it there.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.160
Now, remember,

14:32.200 --> 14:34.168
even though this
is a mock trial,

14:34.200 --> 14:34.939
I do not want

14:34.970 --> 14:36.267
the jury discussing
the case.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.403
This is not a joke.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.260
Grades depend on its outcome.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.676
And let's thank our judge,
Mr. Will Gardner,

14:41.710 --> 14:44.144
for volunteering his time.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.307
(applause)

14:46.350 --> 14:48.671
Anyone else have a problem
with the argument

14:48.720 --> 14:51.188
on page 18, mid-page?

14:51.220 --> 14:52.482
You mean mine?

14:52.520 --> 14:55.114
Well, I didn't know
it was yours.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.254
I just find the citing's
a bit off topic.

14:58.290 --> 14:59.450
Our clients are suing

14:59.490 --> 15:01.355
because their video game
was stolen.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.924
That's all.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.221
Well, I'm here
to listen, Cary,

15:04.270 --> 15:05.669
so why don't
you tell me

15:05.700 --> 15:07.634
how my citings could
be more on topic?

15:09.440 --> 15:11.237
We|_|...
One minute.

15:18.110 --> 15:19.304
What's up?

15:19.350 --> 15:21.477
Nothing. Neighborhood kids
need help.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.181
Want me to get
rid of them?

15:23.220 --> 15:24.619
No, thank you.

15:24.650 --> 15:26.709
Billable hours,
Alicia.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.559
Cary's got his
eye on the prize.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.979
Billable hours.
Thanks, Kalinda.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.328
Sorry, but we didn't know
who else to contact.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.588
That's okay. What happened?

15:34.630 --> 15:36.962
They came for her
an hour after you left.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.194
They can't just
take her away.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.367
Can they?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.662
AMAL:
This was about me.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.133
They want me.

15:42.170 --> 15:43.159
Wait. Who came?

15:43.210 --> 15:45.201
Mom was going to
the grocery store

15:45.240 --> 15:47.208
when this van...

15:47.240 --> 15:50.004
These men got out
and took her.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.178
All we got was this
phone number to call.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.370
The line's been busy all day.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.259
I thought your...

16:01.290 --> 16:02.689
Your mom's a citizen, right?

16:04.390 --> 16:06.688
She spent $8,000

16:06.730 --> 16:08.618
on an immigration attorney
who ripped her off

16:08.660 --> 16:10.298
and never filed
for a green card,

16:10.330 --> 16:12.093
so she just gave up.

16:12.130 --> 16:15.998
She's lived here
for 27 years.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.668
Look, I have some names
of immigration attorneys.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.371
I'll get them for you.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.239
Thank you.
Thanks.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.141
This way.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.444
You're such a pushover.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.718
I am not.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.581
I'm responsible.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.259
No, I mean, I'm responsible
for the Feds questioning him.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.450
You're not responsible

16:37.490 --> 16:39.424
for everything bad
in the world, Alicia.

16:39.460 --> 16:42.759
Where would they
put her, the mom?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.064
Broadview, McHenry Detention,

16:45.100 --> 16:46.260
general population
at Cook County.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.029
They make it a shell game.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.139
But you could find her?

16:49.170 --> 16:50.068
So you're the pushover,

16:50.110 --> 16:52.101
I'm the one
who actually does the work?

16:52.140 --> 16:54.028
No, no. It's fine. I can do it.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.377
Thank you.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.277
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

17:02.320 --> 17:04.083
Mama?

17:06.250 --> 17:07.581
Thanks.

17:07.620 --> 17:10.282
Hey, my good deed
for the year.

17:12.290 --> 17:13.518
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.027
Please stand
on the lines.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.296
All rise,
please.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.228
The Honorable Judge

17:20.270 --> 17:22.431
Gordon_ Tomlin
presrdlng.

17:22.470 --> 17:23.630
(static)

17:23.670 --> 17:25.262
I'm Judge Tomlin,

17:25.310 --> 17:28.234
presiding immigration judge
via closed-circuit in Miami.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.205
Currently presiding
over Cook County I.C.E.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.171
Are we ready, Miss...?

17:33.220 --> 17:34.539
WOMAN:
Bow. Yes, Your Honor.

17:34.580 --> 17:37.185
I.C.E. is petitioning the court

17:37.220 --> 17:39.188
for summary judgment
on Simran Verma's immediate

17:39.220 --> 17:41.757
removal and deportation
to her native India.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.280
Your Honor, I'm sorry,

17:43.330 --> 17:45.787
but Simran has lived
in America for 27 years.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.196
_Too loud
for the microphone, ma'am.

17:48.230 --> 17:52.769
Oh. Mrs. Verma has demonstrated
good moral character.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.360
She supports herself
as a building manager,

17:55.400 --> 17:56.697
and she would be subjected

17:56.740 --> 17:58.731
to undue hardship
if she were separated

17:58.770 --> 17:59.964
from her American-born children.

18:00.010 --> 18:04.344
She more than qualifies for
an adjusted residence status.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.278
Your Honor,
I have a copy

18:05.310 --> 18:06.538
of Simran's application

18:06.580 --> 18:08.844
for a driver's
license from the DMV.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.586
On the application,
she checked

18:10.620 --> 18:12.110
the voter registration box,

18:12.150 --> 18:13.515
thus making
a false claim

18:13.560 --> 18:15.289
of citizenship,
a federal offense.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.787
Your Honor,
these forms are confusing

18:16.820 --> 18:18.287
and often filled out by rote.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.195
The application
clearly states

18:20.230 --> 18:22.721
that making a false claim is
a serious federal offense.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.263
Mrs. Verma should be
permanently inadmissible

18:25.300 --> 18:27.234
as a citizen
of the United States.

18:27.270 --> 18:29.693
Your Honor, her ties
to America are very strong.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.799
Too close for the microphone
again, ma'am.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.308
Summary judgment approved.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.831
Mrs. Verma's deportation
is approved.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.279
Next case.

18:38.310 --> 18:40.210
Oh, Your Honor...
But, Your...

18:40.250 --> 18:42.172
What?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.073
What is happening?
AMAL:
Is that it?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.849
Are they taking her back?
Mrs. Florrick?

18:44.890 --> 18:45.811
What happened?
Wait. Wait.
Mom.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.283
What has happened?
AMAL:
You can't take her!

18:47.320 --> 18:48.719
Mom! Mom!

18:48.760 --> 18:50.387
SIMRAN:
This is absurd.
I am not a criminal.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.421
(buzzer sounding)

18:55.460 --> 18:56.552
Mr. Belkin!

18:56.600 --> 18:57.897
So that's what
this is about.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.591
I won't confirm or deny,

18:59.630 --> 19:01.268
but, ma'am, it would
have been better

19:01.300 --> 19:02.767
if you'd let us
question him.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.438
What do you want?

19:04.470 --> 19:06.438
Identity theft is a
multi-billion dollar burr

19:06.470 --> 19:07.937
in the side of America.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.507
All I ask is that Amal
do his patriotic duty,

19:11.550 --> 19:14.371
help us bring down
the major player.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.742
He does that, you stop
his mother's deportation?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.815
I'll put in
a good word.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.481
That's the problem
with good deeds--

19:24.530 --> 19:27.328
they multiply.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.697
(Diane laughing)

19:35.740 --> 19:37.867
What? I got it cleaned.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.333
So this is why you dropped
all of your appointments

19:40.380 --> 19:41.233
for the next
two days?

19:41.280 --> 19:42.838
Hey, I'm doing good
for the community,

19:42.880 --> 19:45.246
and I'm keeping an eye
on law school prospects.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.178
And of course, there's always

19:46.210 --> 19:48.246
your good friend,
Professor Sadie Hart.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.544
You know what?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.979
I'm not a bad judge.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.385
What's the case?

19:54.420 --> 19:55.614
The mock trial?

19:55.660 --> 19:57.628
It's a... a murder.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.220
Yeah. Double defendants.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.625
Brother and sister.
And the victim?

20:02.660 --> 20:04.321
A homeowner.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.497
It's a fairy tale, isn't it?

20:06.530 --> 20:07.462
Hansel and Gretel.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.264
But it brings up
some interesting legal issues:

20:10.310 --> 20:12.369
trespass, castle law.

20:12.410 --> 20:13.832
Eating other people's houses?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.474
Oh, Will, Alicia dropped by
yesterday wanting a few minutes.

20:16.510 --> 20:17.477
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.516
We are going to have
to deal with that, too.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.381
That?

20:25.420 --> 20:26.978
The junior associate position.

20:27.020 --> 20:28.385
Cary and Alicia.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.388
We said six months;
it's been seven.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.523
It's bad economy
to drop somebody.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.458
Are you getting cold feet?

20:33.500 --> 20:34.728
(chuckles softly)

20:34.760 --> 20:36.398
Next week.

20:36.430 --> 20:38.318
Next week.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.789
They think your work is a front
for selling stolen I.D.'s.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.865
The travel agency?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.866
They traced the false I.D.'s
to that address.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.969
Have you seen
anything there?

20:49.010 --> 20:50.705
No.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.345
But... I haven't wanted to see.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.917
FRIDA:
He'll get our mom a visa--

20:56.950 --> 20:58.315
this Belkin--
if Amal cooperates?

20:58.350 --> 20:59.248
KALIN DA:
Yeah.

20:59.290 --> 21:01.508
The Feds want you
to download three files

21:01.560 --> 21:02.959
from your boss's computer:

21:02.990 --> 21:05.550
PAL-one, two, three.

21:05.590 --> 21:06.784
FRIDA:
It's mom.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.422
You have to. Amal.

21:09.460 --> 21:10.427
I know.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.735
You don't know what these
guys are capable of.

21:13.770 --> 21:15.658
FRIDA:
I don't know why you think
you're the only one...!

21:15.700 --> 21:17.565
You seem less than sympathetic.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.362
Their mother's illegal.

21:19.410 --> 21:20.877
With 27 years
in this country.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.673
27 years of
being illegal.

21:22.710 --> 21:24.905
I would've thought you would've
been more sympathetic.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.303
Why?

21:26.350 --> 21:28.443
Because my parents
immigrated legally,

21:28.480 --> 21:29.777
you thought I'd be
more sympathetic

21:29.820 --> 21:31.913
to someone who immigrated
here illegally?

21:31.950 --> 21:33.611
My mistake.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.514
So, who are they?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.482
Big case.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.418
Can't talk about it.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.889
Yeah?

21:45.770 --> 21:47.965
They're the video game
clients, right?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.888
Can't talk about it.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.500
Well, do you need
some help with it?

21:52.540 --> 21:55.703
Because I know
the gamer world.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.799
Luclq you.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.009
I'm sorry I didn't call
you back right away.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.780
I'm on this mock trial
thing at DePaul.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.378
Oh, that's all right.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.115
I was just making sure
everything was all right

22:09.160 --> 22:11.378
after the other night.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.681
One minute.

22:12.730 --> 22:14.425
Oh.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.927
Everything is all right.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.995
You sure?

22:20.030 --> 22:23.136
Because... I'm sorry.

22:23.170 --> 22:27.630
Alicia, you don't have
any reason to be sorry.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.547
I was pushing a situation
that was wrong to push.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.706
You weren't.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.513
I was.

22:33.550 --> 22:35.814
Don't worry.

22:35.850 --> 22:37.112
We're good.

22:37.150 --> 22:38.549
We're going to be good.

22:41.620 --> 22:44.020
(door opens, closes)

22:47.030 --> 22:48.725
PAL-one,

22:48.760 --> 22:50.523
two, three?

22:50.570 --> 22:51.559
Yes, just three files.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.692
That's all they want.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.129
You won't be alone.

22:54.170 --> 22:55.364
Look.

22:56.570 --> 22:58.162
They don't want
to arrest them;

22:58.210 --> 23:00.576
they want to do this quietly,
in and out.

23:05.710 --> 23:09.612
Did you tell them about
the Pujari brothers?

23:09.650 --> 23:11.618
Belkin knows that your bosses
are potentially dangerous.

23:11.650 --> 23:13.618
He also knows
you did nothing wrong.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.878
He'll keep his promise
to release my mother?

23:15.920 --> 23:17.729
We have a deal in writing.

23:19.660 --> 23:20.524
Amal,

23:20.560 --> 23:23.620
take a deep breath,
think about your mom.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.011
(indistinct chattering)

24:02.200 --> 24:04.009
(object clatters on floor)

24:21.260 --> 24:24.787
Uh, do you have
any direct flights to Agra?

24:28.030 --> 24:29.691
Calm down.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.766
(whispering):
When have you ever know
someone to calm down

24:31.800 --> 24:33.665
when you tell them to calm down?

24:37.640 --> 24:39.631
Could you turn the screen
toward me

24:39.670 --> 24:41.206
so I can see
the direct flights

24:41.240 --> 24:43.800
to Agra, please?

25:00.630 --> 25:03.690
(indistinct chattering,
phones ringing)

25:16.210 --> 25:17.871
Oh, found it.

25:17.910 --> 25:19.172
Download it.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.295
They're exiting the building.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.031
(horns honking)
AGENT:
Hold it, hold it.

25:41.070 --> 25:42.196
AGENT:
Federal agents!

25:42.240 --> 25:44.208
Hold it right there. Put your
hands where I can see them.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.800
Get agents in there
and sweep the place.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.916
AGENT:
Call it in, all right?

25:57.380 --> 25:59.143
Mr. Gardner, do
you have a moment?

25:59.190 --> 26:00.817
Sure, what
do you need?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.054
What am I doing wrong?

26:02.090 --> 26:03.626
What are you...

26:03.660 --> 26:05.025
I didn't know you were
doing anything wrong.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.857
There were 38 objections
and I lost 34,

26:06.890 --> 26:08.721
so what am I doing?
Well, at the moment,

26:08.760 --> 26:10.967
what you're doing
is playing the ref.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.820
Tell me, teach me.
You want me

26:12.870 --> 26:15.259
to tell you why I'm deciding
against you?

26:15.300 --> 26:18.007
Yes, half of those objections
could have gone either way.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.007
That's not true.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.632
Where are you from,
Chicago?

26:20.680 --> 26:21.908
Is this important
for the lesson?

26:21.940 --> 26:23.077
It's important
for a life lesson.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.839
Judge asks you a question,
you answer.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.279
You don't come back
with another question.

26:26.310 --> 26:27.470
Why?
Because court
IS a lesson

26:27.510 --> 26:30.638
in humility, and you just
came back with another question.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.817
So you're deciding against me
because I'm not humble?

26:32.850 --> 26:37.719
No, I'm deciding against you
because you're wrong on the law,

26:37.760 --> 26:38.852
but life is not the classroom

26:38.890 --> 26:41.688
and judges decide things
all the time based on a whim--

26:41.730 --> 26:43.197
which attorneys
they like, they trust.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.891
Oh, so you don't like me?

26:44.930 --> 26:45.760
Oh, my God,
you're like a three-year-old

26:45.800 --> 26:46.767
with the questions.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.893
I said
the textbooks go

26:48.940 --> 26:50.703
out the window
when you're In court.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.958
_ Charm and finesse is_
just as Important as logIc.

26:53.010 --> 26:56.173
Okay, so I need
to work on my charm?

26:56.210 --> 26:59.839
To succeed in court,

26:59.880 --> 27:01.313
you need to work on everything.

27:01.350 --> 27:04.649
Okay.

27:04.690 --> 27:05.884
Then what?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.888
(sighs)
Let's see.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.921
Cross-examination.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.121
(speaking indistinctly)

27:18.170 --> 27:19.364
What?

27:23.140 --> 27:25.199
Hey, I'm a big gamer.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.368
In college they used to call me
the thumb-meister.

27:28.410 --> 27:30.844
Grand Theft Auto, you know.

27:33.210 --> 27:35.212
Thanks, man.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.318
ALICIA:
What do you mean

27:38.350 --> 27:39.783
you're not releasing
Simran?

27:39.820 --> 27:40.855
We had a deal.

27:40.890 --> 27:41.879
Right, we had a deal.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.909
Your boy blew it apart.

27:42.960 --> 27:43.927
What?

27:43.960 --> 27:45.427
Amal got you the data.

27:45.460 --> 27:47.382
He also warned the Pujari
brothers to get out.

27:47.430 --> 27:48.829
No, he didn't.
Someone sent
them a text.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.919
Well, you still got
what you wanted.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.062
You made
your arrest.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.124
I didn't want
to bust the brothers.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.728
I wanted their buyer.

27:54.770 --> 27:56.965
We only arrested them
so they wouldn't take off on us.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.228
Now the whole
operatIon Is scattered.

27:58.270 --> 28:01.398
Because of your client,
eight months of work
is shot to hell.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.135
And Simran, what about Simran?

28:03.180 --> 28:04.374
Deportation.

28:04.410 --> 28:05.809
Oh, come on, this...
Ma'am,

28:05.850 --> 28:07.306
you know what this
is? It's the law.

28:07.350 --> 28:09.944
She broke the law and now
she's paying the consequences.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.756
Mrs. Florrick.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.199
Gerald Kozko?

28:24.230 --> 28:25.959
Yes, I know who you are.

28:26.000 --> 28:26.898
I only need a minute.

28:26.930 --> 28:27.999
I'm leaving now.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.929
Please, I...

28:30.970 --> 28:33.234
I want you to give
your husband a message.

28:33.270 --> 28:34.999
I want you to tell him

28:35.040 --> 28:36.871
that my son had nothing
to do with this.

28:36.910 --> 28:41.415
I was the one that made
the deal with Childs.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.338
I'm cleaning up my mess.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.416
My son is completely...
No.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.247
Mrs. Florrick...

28:47.290 --> 28:50.350
No, that's it, Mr. Kozko,
I'm not your go-between.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.824
You want to give Peter
a message, pick up the phone.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.919
Mrs. Florrick,
you don't realize...

28:54.960 --> 28:56.928
Yes, and I don't want
to realize.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.518
I've had enough of everything.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.959
You don't understand;
I don't have anybody.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.968
(elevator bell dings,
doors opening)
You know what?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.069
I don't care.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.804
I don't know you.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.273
You don't know me.

29:10.310 --> 29:11.447
Help me.

29:12.950 --> 29:14.975
ALICIA:
Okay,

29:15.020 --> 29:15.816
family meeting.

29:15.850 --> 29:16.976
We're going to
settle some things.

29:17.020 --> 29:20.478
From now on...

29:20.520 --> 29:22.988
we tell each
other the truth.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.988
No more lying to the
sheriff about skateboards

29:25.030 --> 29:27.328
or to me about secret packages.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.920
Okay?

29:29.960 --> 29:32.224
Where's Dad?
This isn't about him;
this is about us.

29:33.270 --> 29:38.060
So I'll go first.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.260
I've been very angry
with your father.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.039
I almost walked out
a few nights ago,

29:42.080 --> 29:44.378
but we've decided
to gIve It a go.

29:44.410 --> 29:46.298
In separate rooms?

29:46.350 --> 29:48.944
Yes, and you two will just
have to deal with that.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.516
You're almost
grown-ups.

29:50.550 --> 29:53.189
You'll realize that adults
have compIIcated emotIons.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.552
Zach, your turn.

29:56.590 --> 29:57.955
My turn?

29:57.990 --> 29:59.582
What's on your mind?

29:59.630 --> 30:01.188
Mom, it's really late.

30:01.230 --> 30:03.027
I'm seeing Becca.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.061
Okay, this is progress.

30:08.470 --> 30:09.835
And I will be honest

30:09.870 --> 30:12.361
in telling you
that I don't like Becca,

30:12.410 --> 30:15.129
but I think you should
bring her to dinner

30:15.180 --> 30:17.501
so we_can have a
proper IntroductIon.

30:17.540 --> 30:18.905
Okay.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.008
Grace.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.268
Who's Will?

30:25.320 --> 30:27.880
Will Gardner-- my boss.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.081
I heard you talking
to him on the phone

30:31.130 --> 30:33.280
a week ago.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.059
You were whispering

30:35.100 --> 30:37.227
at night.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.034
He's my boss...

30:41.070 --> 30:44.062
and we used to know
each other In college

30:44.110 --> 30:47.307
and we thought that we were
attracted to each other,

30:47.340 --> 30:48.500
but it's over.

30:48.540 --> 30:51.100
What's over?

30:51.150 --> 30:53.402
Thinking that we were attracted
to each other.

30:53.450 --> 30:55.247
But he's still your boss.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.214
Yes.
So what happened?

30:59.250 --> 31:02.253
Actually, that's all
I intend to share right now.

31:02.290 --> 31:05.327
Your father and
I are agreeIng

31:05.360 --> 31:09.490
to make this work and I have
agreed to trust you agaIn,

31:09.530 --> 31:10.929
so good night.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.168
Sweet dreams.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.964
It's getting to her.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.137
Definitely.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.307
(phone ringing)

31:26.150 --> 31:28.118
Hi.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.344
Yeah, it's me.

31:29.380 --> 31:30.347
You're working late.

31:30.380 --> 31:33.247
Yeah, on this good deed
someone saddled me with.

31:33.290 --> 31:35.383
Belkin won't budge;
I already went to him.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.388
They weren't after
the Pujari brothers.

31:37.420 --> 31:39.126
They were after their buyers.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.025
Now they're looking
for the go-between.

31:41.060 --> 31:44.188
Really?

31:44.230 --> 31:46.596
Then maybe we have something
to negotiate with.

31:55.210 --> 31:58.475
Okay, go ahead.

31:58.510 --> 32:00.649
Did you threaten Kozko?

32:00.680 --> 32:01.942
Yes.

32:01.980 --> 32:03.447
Downstairs at
Lord of Christ?

32:03.480 --> 32:06.449
Yes.

32:06.490 --> 32:08.014
Do you want to know why?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.387
He was wearing a wire.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.194
He made a deal
with Childs for immunity.

32:14.230 --> 32:16.152
And why'd he do that?

32:16.200 --> 32:17.326
I don't know why.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.327
Because
you steered

32:18.370 --> 32:20.361
investigations away from him?

32:22.070 --> 32:23.196
Everything, Peter.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.267
I want to know everything.

32:29.310 --> 32:31.369
(sighs)

32:33.110 --> 32:38.047
Everybody has friends,
everybody has enemies.

32:38.090 --> 32:41.082
I did things
for Kozko as a friend.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.680
That were illegal?

32:44.730 --> 32:47.756
No, but...

32:47.790 --> 32:49.997
the line gets fuzzy.

32:57.270 --> 33:00.205
Who paid for this?

33:00.240 --> 33:01.138
I did.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.172
Then why isn't the receipt
in your name?

33:04.210 --> 33:06.269
I went to the store, Peter.

33:09.650 --> 33:12.141
I wanted to get you
something nice...

33:12.190 --> 33:14.215
I didn't have the money.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.285
Kozko
lent me the money.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.753
And that was illegal.

33:17.790 --> 33:21.157
That was... fuzzy.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.622
Look, Alicia,

33:24.670 --> 33:26.763
I want to run again,

33:26.800 --> 33:30.065
but I want to do it
right this time,
nothing fuzzy.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.636
And I only want
to do it

33:31.670 --> 33:33.262
if you're with me.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.301
If we're in this together.

33:36.810 --> 33:39.677
These? No, I don't know
who handles these.

33:39.710 --> 33:42.747
They look like they
were mounted in a
necklace or something.

33:42.780 --> 33:45.817
Well, your best bet
with jewelry is not here.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.317
Thanks for your
time, anyway.

33:47.350 --> 33:48.817
The box is another matter.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.487
You recognize the box?

33:50.520 --> 33:51.748
It's a camphor box.

33:51.790 --> 33:55.556
It's sold down the street
at the Mundy bazaar.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.692
Thanks.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.823
MAN:
All rise.
The Honorable

33:58.870 --> 34:02.033
Will Gardner presiding.

34:04.540 --> 34:07.134
Is the defense ready
with its first witness?

34:07.170 --> 34:09.479
Yes, Your Honor. I just
have a quick motion first.

34:09.510 --> 34:10.329
Proceed.

34:13.210 --> 34:16.418
Title 28, USC-455A provides:

34:16.450 --> 34:18.645
a judge must recuse himself

34:18.690 --> 34:20.749
in any proceeding
in which his impartiality

34:20.790 --> 34:22.109
may be reasonably
questioned.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.526
The defense asks
that you do so now.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.720
Recuse yourself.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.490
Ms. Cabrini, we've
been through this.

34:28.530 --> 34:29.849
I'm not biased
agaInst you.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.868
I agree.
You're biased for me.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.697
(chuckles)
Really?

34:33.730 --> 34:35.561
You're gonna have
to explain that one.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.693
Well, yesterday after court,
you advised me

34:37.740 --> 34:39.765
on how to cross7examine
and questIon

34:39.810 --> 34:43.701
witnesses for this trial,
clearly demonstrating bias.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.173
You asked for advice.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.245
United States v. Burger.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.248
If a reasonable person
knowing the relevant facts

34:48.280 --> 34:50.817
would harbor doubts about
a judge's impartiality,

34:50.850 --> 34:53.489
he must recuse himself.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.556
Motion denied, Ms. Cabrini.

34:55.590 --> 34:57.785
Why don't we take a break
for a minute, Mr. Gardner.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.550
Sadie, she set me up.

35:00.590 --> 35:03.195
Okay, I think we're in an
awloNard area here, Your Honor.

35:03.230 --> 35:04.595
What? I didn't
do anything wrong.

35:04.630 --> 35:06.689
Thanks so much for your help.

35:06.730 --> 35:07.799
You believe her?

35:07.830 --> 35:09.889
I believe I'll take the robe.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.807
Yep. Men and 25-year-olds.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.671
Same thing happened
to my ex.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.837
What are you
talking about?
(groans)

35:18.850 --> 35:21.739
We think these gems,
they're Kashmir blue sapphires,

35:21.780 --> 35:24.783
were used in payment
for the I.D.'s

35:24.820 --> 35:28.153
If we can find the smuggler,
we can find the buyer.

35:28.190 --> 35:29.851
And if you find
the buyer?

35:29.890 --> 35:32.427
Then Belkin will get you a visa.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.928
But they're deporting me
on the next transport.
I know.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.258
My associates are still running
these sapphires down.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.791
I... I don't know anybody
in India, Mrs. Florrick.

35:39.830 --> 35:41.866
My life... my life is here.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.436
I know.

35:44.640 --> 35:48.269
Can I see Amal and Frida
before I go?

35:49.480 --> 35:52.142
I'm... I'm working on it.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.370
Please, um...

35:59.990 --> 36:01.855
no?

36:04.760 --> 36:06.921
I need a few items,
and then...

36:06.960 --> 36:08.655
and the sentimental things.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.337
Yes, of course I will.

36:17.970 --> 36:20.268
And will you tell Amal it's not

36:20.310 --> 36:21.937
his fault, mm?

36:23.310 --> 36:24.902
(sobs):
Thank you.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.941
(buzzer sounding)

36:30.850 --> 36:32.841
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

36:51.340 --> 36:52.807
KALIN DA:
Cary?

36:52.840 --> 36:53.864
Hi. Can you hear me?

36:53.910 --> 36:56.003
Okay, I need you bring it to me.

36:56.040 --> 36:59.009
What, the gems?
No, the box.
I need you to bring the box.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.540
All right, all right,
but I'm just driving around

37:00.580 --> 37:02.719
_ in circles here--
LIttle IndIa's a nIghtmare.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.911
I'll e-mail them to your car,
the directions.

37:04.950 --> 37:07.680
(phone rings)
All right. Hold on,
that's my other line. Hello?

37:07.720 --> 37:09.585
Hi, Cary.
Are you near Kalinda?

37:09.620 --> 37:11.850
No. I'm looking for her
right now.

37:11.890 --> 37:13.983
And ha-ha, very funny,
it's not about gaming.

37:14.030 --> 37:15.588
Wait, hold on a second.

37:15.630 --> 37:17.894
All right, I got it.
What do you need?

37:17.930 --> 37:20.262
Tell her I think
Simran's involved.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.768
The sapphires used
to pay the Pujari brothers,

37:22.800 --> 37:24.904
I found the same jewels
in her apartment.

37:24.940 --> 37:27.329
Damn it. All right,
well, I'll tell her.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.703
Namaste.
(speaking Hindi)

37:30.740 --> 37:32.002
What did he say?

37:32.050 --> 37:34.917
I don't know.
I don't speak Hindi.

37:34.950 --> 37:36.679
What do you mean,
you don't Hindi?

37:36.720 --> 37:38.017
I didn't grow up in India.

37:38.050 --> 37:40.541
Do you speak English?

37:40.590 --> 37:43.957
No, no.
(speaking Hindi)

37:43.990 --> 37:47.653
Oh, seriously, Kalinda,
where is your cultural identity?

37:47.690 --> 37:49.999
Uh, I'm looking for
a box like this.

37:50.030 --> 37:52.726
Ah...
(speaking Hindi)

37:54.500 --> 37:55.762
Ah, thank you.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.631
I don't think
Simran was involved.

37:57.670 --> 37:58.967
What? You just
get a hunch?

37:59.970 --> 38:02.370
No. Better.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.954
So,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.592
your back?

38:23.630 --> 38:24.961
I'm back.

38:26.030 --> 38:28.533
Uh, did, uh,
Hansel and Gretel get off?

38:28.570 --> 38:30.561
I don't know.
I recused myself.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.965
You recused yourself

38:32.010 --> 38:34.376
from the prosecution
of Hansel and Gretel?

38:34.410 --> 38:35.536
(chuckling)

38:35.580 --> 38:37.969
What, were you
dating Gretel?

38:38.010 --> 38:40.103
For a few weeks.
Bad time.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.845
(chuckling)

38:41.880 --> 38:42.847
What's that?

38:42.880 --> 38:46.088
DIANE:
Oh, that?
A personal case, immigration.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.042
I'm letting them
run with it.

38:48.090 --> 38:49.489
Excuse me.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.078
Someone to see you,
Will-- Giada Cabrini.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.485
No appointment.

38:52.530 --> 38:53.656
Send her in.

38:53.690 --> 38:55.954
Long lost love?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.922
No. A student.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.825
This should be interesting.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.749
Your Honor.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.380
Ms. Cabrini.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.020
Ithought

39:26.060 --> 39:27.721
I'd bring you some gingerbread.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.955
So, did you win?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.524
No, actually.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.765
To be honest,
I think they did it.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.034
Very clever,
getting me recused.

39:39.070 --> 39:40.901
Yes, well, you were biased.

39:40.940 --> 39:43.534
And you're here because...?

39:43.580 --> 39:45.707
I want to take you to dinner.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.502
No hard feelings.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.541
How old are you?

39:49.580 --> 39:51.946
25. How old are you?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.480
Not 25.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.750
Well, I won't
hold that against you.

39:57.820 --> 40:00.129
Come on, I'll buy.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.094
Let me think about it.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.091
Okay.

40:05.130 --> 40:06.961
I'll wait.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.728
BE|__KIN: _
You're wastIng your tIme.

40:11.770 --> 40:14.477
Deportations fall under I.C.E.

40:14.510 --> 40:15.772
The US. Attorney's Office

40:15.810 --> 40:17.107
can't countermand
theIr order of removal.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.040
We can still authorize
an 5-1 VIsa.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.048
A snitch visa?

40:21.080 --> 40:23.071
For whom,
the mother?

40:23.120 --> 40:24.041
You want the Pujaris' contact

40:24.080 --> 40:25.843
with organized
crime, right?

40:25.890 --> 40:28.017
Well, if Simran
gets deported,

40:28.050 --> 40:29.153
so does the name.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.626
I seem to be missing something.

40:39.200 --> 40:43.466
I'm open to a new proffer, but
I'll need to see a statement.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.782
I sacrificed.

41:06.830 --> 41:09.048
Now it's your turn.

41:18.070 --> 41:19.935
I was the courier

41:19.970 --> 41:23.474
between the Pujari brothers
and their buyers.

41:25.750 --> 41:29.743
They offered me
a lot of money to do it.

41:30.920 --> 41:35.254
They threatened me
ifI told anyone.

41:35.290 --> 41:38.782
So I kept it from my mother...

41:38.830 --> 41:40.786
and Amal.

41:44.100 --> 41:47.661
I was the one who texted
the brothers you were watching.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.190
Okay. That's enough.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.262
You get the rest
when you get the visa.

41:58.710 --> 42:00.871
Give me a few hours.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.221
She'll get jail time,
you know.

42:12.260 --> 42:15.525
She knows.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.706
(man speaks indistinctly
over radio)

42:33.750 --> 42:35.741
(door hinges squeaking)

42:36.780 --> 42:38.941
Thank you.
CARY:
No problem.

42:47.260 --> 42:48.284
That's nice.

42:48.330 --> 42:49.627
Isn't that nice?

42:50.660 --> 42:52.628
No big case,
no video games--

42:52.670 --> 42:54.592
we just did
some good here.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.289
Actually, Alicia
and I did some good.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.092
You just drove the car.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.108
Oh, that is not fair.

43:00.140 --> 43:01.334
I'm the one
who found...
Shh, shh, shh.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.632
What is it?

43:02.680 --> 43:05.649
...today a car believed...
...was found abandoned...
Hold on.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.649
I'm gonna play it back.

43:08.680 --> 43:09.476
Patience.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.340
And now back
to our headline news.

43:11.380 --> 43:14.952
Chicago real estate developer
Gerald Kozko is missing,

43:14.990 --> 43:16.981
in fear to have taken
his own life.

43:17.020 --> 43:19.750
NEWSWOMAN:
Authorities fear Mr. Kozko
may have committed suicide

43:19.790 --> 43:22.293
by jumping from
the Des Plaines River Bridge

43:22.330 --> 43:24.059
just outside the Loop.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.624
Police found his abandoned car

43:25.670 --> 43:28.389
parked midway across the bridge
earlier today.

43:28.430 --> 43:29.738
There are no witnesses,

43:29.770 --> 43:31.397
and no body has yet
been recovered,

43:31.440 --> 43:33.658
but police boats and divers
continue to search...

43:33.710 --> 43:36.304
ZACH:
Mom! DInner!

43:36.340 --> 43:38.376

Hey, babe, we're
