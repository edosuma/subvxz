01:20.266 --> 01:23.033
Gabrielle?

01:24.999 --> 01:27.565
Gabrielle, wake up.

01:27.567 --> 01:30.401
No, let me sleep.

01:31.668 --> 01:33.964
Come on, Gabrielle.

01:33.966 --> 01:36.298
- What time is it?
- Seven o'clock.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.901
Willy's coming today.

01:42.701 --> 01:44.334
Well.

02:20.567 --> 02:23.299
At least it was an entertainment.
It takes so long to get here.

02:23.301 --> 02:25.531
And how is Paris
these days, Willy?

02:25.533 --> 02:28.398
It's a hotbed.
It's electric.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.565
It's heaving with artists
and poets and writers,

02:31.567 --> 02:33.997
all seeking to say
something profound.

02:33.999 --> 02:36.998
Most of them are too young,
of course, or too crazed,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.365
but still, they generate
a certain life force.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.632
We were going in to see
a play, weren't we?

02:41.634 --> 02:44.998
- Yes, <i>La Tosca.</i>
- Ah.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.532
Yes. No, I...
I was at the opening.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.399
I wouldn't bother,
to be frank.

02:49.401 --> 02:52.132
I mean, Sarah Bernhardt does her best.
She always does.

02:52.134 --> 02:53.532
But it's melodramatic
in extremis.

02:53.534 --> 02:56.564
- Maybe I'll go, make up my own mind.
- Well, of course.

02:56.566 --> 02:59.299
But do remember, if a book bores
you, you can throw it away.

02:59.301 --> 03:02.231
If a painting is too garish,
then you can close your eyes.

03:02.233 --> 03:04.665
But bad theater,
it's like dentistry.

03:04.667 --> 03:08.265
You're compelled to stay in your
chair, having your skull drilled

03:08.267 --> 03:10.632
until the entire
grisly procedure is over.

03:10.634 --> 03:12.235
Good point, Willy.

03:13.033 --> 03:15.000
Painful business.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.134
Oh, I almost forgot.

03:23.567 --> 03:26.001
- A small gift.
- Thank you.

03:31.934 --> 03:34.000
You turn it upside down.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.933
Pretty.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.200
Good-bye.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.098
Sido, I'm going
for a walk.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.965
Change your dress first.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.068
- I'll stay on the path.
- Change it.

03:55.133 --> 03:56.900
Darling,
we're going to go in.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.465
He's a good man.
He has a reputation, yes.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.665
But there comes a time in a
man's life to settle down.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.531
Have you finished the letter
to his father?

04:08.533 --> 04:10.531
I keep starting.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.932
But I can't seem
to finish it.

04:12.934 --> 04:16.697
A girl without a dowry, that just
doesn't happen in their circles.

04:16.699 --> 04:19.997
Hmm. They call it off.
The world won't end.

04:19.999 --> 04:23.198
Sido.
He clearly adores her.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.398
He's visited
four times this year.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.331
I'm worried that
he won't understand her.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.531
- Would anyone be good enough for you?
- Can I go now?

04:29.533 --> 04:32.198
Just take this with you and fill
it up with some blackberries.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.165
I'm going to make a tart tomorrow.
Don't be late back!

04:34.167 --> 04:35.001
I won't.

05:08.199 --> 05:10.867
- Where are you?
- Over here.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.032
Your hair
is a phenomenon.

05:21.034 --> 05:23.931
In the village, they call me
"the girl with the hair."

05:23.933 --> 05:25.465
I'm sure they do.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.468
I should think you're quite
famous here in your village.

05:29.967 --> 05:32.398
How much time
do we have?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.531
About 40 minutes.

05:34.533 --> 05:37.001
But I have to
walk to the station.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.665
Gabrielle, I can't tell you
how happy I am.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.599
So am I.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.435
I adore you.

05:56.666 --> 05:57.998
<i>Dear Willy,</i>

05:58.000 --> 06:02.198
<i>As I walked home by the river, the
light shining through the trees,</i>

06:02.200 --> 06:05.997
<i>my heart filled with
a kind of delicious pride.</i>

06:05.999 --> 06:09.630
<i>After all, you know all
those fine women of Paris,</i>

06:09.632 --> 06:11.900
<i>so I must have something.</i>

06:13.566 --> 06:16.664
<i>I want to wake up next to you,</i>

06:16.666 --> 06:19.565
<i>know that the day is ours,</i>

06:19.567 --> 06:23.299
<i>that life is ours
for the taking.</i>

06:23.301 --> 06:26.934
<i>We will be so entire
and so happy, my love.</i>

06:36.967 --> 06:39.597
Breathe in, ma'am.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.934
There we go.

06:50.133 --> 06:52.265
Ready yet?

06:52.267 --> 06:53.901
No, not yet.

06:59.066 --> 07:00.965
What do you think,
Matilde?

07:00.967 --> 07:02.997
It's pretty, ma'am.

07:02.999 --> 07:05.900
We should try to get there
before it ends.

07:08.666 --> 07:12.365
- Where's your new dress?
- Oh, I couldn't breathe in it. It felt ridiculous.

07:12.367 --> 07:15.530
But that cost me 267 francs.
Don't you like it?

07:15.532 --> 07:17.665
Well, I know you like it.

07:17.667 --> 07:20.134
We'll get it adjusted.

07:36.233 --> 07:38.933
- What is it?
- I think it's toothpaste.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.435
Let's have a look.

07:43.401 --> 07:45.531
There. Perfect.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.234
Let's go in.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.400
Willy.

08:10.434 --> 08:12.497
It's monstrous.
I can't look at it.

08:12.499 --> 08:14.598
Don't worry, my dear.
It's only temporary.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.664
There's Willy. Willy, Eiffel's tower.
Are you for or against?

08:18.666 --> 08:22.463
Oh, I'm for it, if a little
jealous of this giant erection

08:22.465 --> 08:24.998
in the heart of our capital
belonging to somebody else.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.398
How are you, Count?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.131
- I'm well, thank you.
- Ah. You rogue, Willy.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.665
I see you've brought us
an orphaned relative?

08:31.667 --> 08:33.530
- Hmm.
- A secret love child.

08:33.532 --> 08:34.797
Very good, very good.

08:34.799 --> 08:38.462
No, may I introduce to you my
wife, Gabrielle Sidonie Colette.

08:38.465 --> 08:40.231
- Pleased to meet you.
- Delighted.

08:40.232 --> 08:42.429
Well, astonished,
actually.

08:42.432 --> 08:45.964
You, my dear, have caught
the slipperiest of eels.

08:45.966 --> 08:47.232
Now, now, Arman.

08:47.234 --> 08:50.665
- How does one do that?
- I'm not sure.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.664
Where are you from,
you sweet thing?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.933
Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye.

08:55.966 --> 08:57.198
- It's in Burgundy.
- Ah.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.065
Is that where
you got your dress?

08:59.067 --> 09:02.697
- Have you relocated, Willy?
- Not yet, Count, not yet.

09:02.699 --> 09:05.132
Ignore him. How on earth
did you two meet?

09:05.134 --> 09:07.399
Our fathers served together
in the army.

09:07.401 --> 09:10.065
Willy married!
The wild days are done, eh?

09:10.067 --> 09:12.563
On the contrary, the wild
days have just begun.

09:12.565 --> 09:15.364
Ah! Willy.
Thank God you're back.

09:15.366 --> 09:18.431
- That short story.
- Veber, may I introduce to you my wife.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.098
- What?
- Gabrielle.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.498
Very pleased to meet you.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.364
It's due on Tuesday, and you've not
given me the slightest clue...

09:25.366 --> 09:27.998
Right. Just amuse yourself
for a moment, Gabrielle.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.497
It's simple.
It's an 800-word sketch.

09:51.266 --> 09:53.134
You poor thing.

09:55.433 --> 09:58.335
You want the earth
and the grass, don't you?

10:41.966 --> 10:45.197
That's
gardenia, isn't it?

10:45.199 --> 10:48.265
Well, what is it? It's
calla lilies, isn't it?

10:59.699 --> 11:01.466
So, what did you
think of the salon?

11:03.034 --> 11:05.363
I liked the tortoise.

11:05.365 --> 11:09.531
I thought he was as bored as I was.

11:09.533 --> 11:12.097
I suspect you were more
intimidated than bored.

11:12.099 --> 11:13.965
No.

11:13.967 --> 11:17.198
I thought they were all...
shallow and pretentious.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.330
No. Come on.
You're reading them wrongly.

11:20.332 --> 11:25.132
It's not so much pretension
as exaggeration.

11:25.134 --> 11:28.998
The ideal is to be authentic
but larger than life.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.131
To present a personality
with a capital "P."

11:32.133 --> 11:35.597
You could do it too.
Country girl charm.

11:35.599 --> 11:37.498
Did that woman
have a capital "P"?

11:37.500 --> 11:41.034
- Which one?
- The one you were talking to in the red dress.

11:42.332 --> 11:44.997
Nicole D'Allier?

11:44.999 --> 11:47.397
Come on, that was...
that was just flirtation.

11:47.399 --> 11:49.463
- It meant nothing.
- Well, then, why do it?

11:49.465 --> 11:51.563
Because that's what one
does to pass the time,

11:51.565 --> 11:54.064
stave off boredom.

11:54.066 --> 11:56.563
Come on.
Forget about them.

11:56.565 --> 11:59.264
Have you heard the news?

11:59.266 --> 12:02.430
Willy is married.
Happily married.

12:02.432 --> 12:06.933
And he's going home with his beautiful
bride, who he loves very much.

12:22.233 --> 12:25.001
- Good morning, Monsieur Veber.
- Morning, Matilde.

12:26.199 --> 12:28.298
- Hello, Veber.
- Gabrielle.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.998
- It's cold out there today.
- I wouldn't know. I'm under house arrest.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.530
Schwob's already in there.

12:33.532 --> 12:34.865
Thank you.

12:34.867 --> 12:39.630
All the humor and vivacity descends
into a dreadful operatic swamp.

12:39.632 --> 12:42.363
It releases the very toxins
of man's soul,

12:42.365 --> 12:44.998
leaving the audience
nauseous and pale,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.430
like they've just eaten
a bad oyster.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.065
That's a bit extreme. I actually thought
the ending was rather touching.

12:50.067 --> 12:52.630
No middle ground. Don't soft-peddle it.
Just kill it.

12:52.632 --> 12:54.697
- Veber.
- Willy.

12:54.699 --> 12:56.463
Schwob.

12:56.465 --> 12:59.164
So add those embellishments and
file it with <i>The Echo</i> by 6:00.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.964
Will do.

13:00.966 --> 13:03.264
The factory's on fire.
We're on fire.

13:03.266 --> 13:06.165
I have this remarkable idea.
Or at least I think it could be.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.434
- All right, what is it?
- I'm going to launch a novel.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.597
- A novel?
- Yeah, we have stories by Willy.

13:11.599 --> 13:14.464
We have music reviews by Willy.
Now we have Willy's first novel.

13:14.466 --> 13:16.563
It'll have enough literature
for the highbrows

13:16.565 --> 13:20.231
and enough filth for the great
unwashed, or vice versa.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.234
And who's going to
write this novel?

13:23.667 --> 13:26.134
You are.

13:31.999 --> 13:33.697
Are you writing
for him too?

13:33.699 --> 13:35.698
Mm-hmm.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.631
He's made you one
of his ghosts already?

13:38.633 --> 13:40.530
Just letters.

13:40.532 --> 13:44.031
You're fastidious.
Exacting.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.664
A lot of crossing out,
you mean.

13:45.666 --> 13:46.731
Well, yes.

13:46.733 --> 13:50.264
Willy copies them out
so they're in his handwriting.

13:50.266 --> 13:52.531
No one has handwriting
like Monsieur Willy.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.431
We first meet her,
Monna.

13:55.433 --> 13:58.196
She's being held aloft on the
shoulders of her admirers.

13:58.198 --> 14:01.464
She's 18, she's gorgeous,
she's dangerous,

14:01.466 --> 14:06.032
she's from the streets, she devours
men, she never wears a corset.

14:06.034 --> 14:09.130
And then him,
our hero, Renaud,

14:09.132 --> 14:12.931
he's a writer,
he's a genius.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.298
He's captivated by her.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.330
She seduces him
in her shabby rooms.

14:16.332 --> 14:19.497
They have five entire days
of carnal ecstasy,

14:19.499 --> 14:22.263
after which she has
this incredible hold on him.

14:22.265 --> 14:25.196
She instinctively understands
his basest desires.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.631
And we wonder,
will he ever escape?

14:26.633 --> 14:30.965
Will he ever get back to his wholesome
friends and his burgeoning career?

14:30.967 --> 14:34.364
Or will he be dragged down
by her toxic embrace,

14:34.366 --> 14:38.630
forget about his writing, and just
wallow in the sexual quagmire?

14:38.632 --> 14:40.333
It's brilliant.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.367
It will be.

14:46.399 --> 14:48.965
Come on, tell me. How
long do you think it will take?

14:48.967 --> 14:50.531
- Two or three months.
- No, no, no, no.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.398
Weeks, Veber.
It has to be weeks.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.064
- Write for four hours at a time.
- All right, all right.

14:55.066 --> 14:56.931
Good-bye, Gabrielle.

14:56.933 --> 14:58.597
If I get stuck,
I'll come back to you.

14:58.599 --> 15:00.564
Yes, yes,
but write, and fast.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.132
Let's get some money
coming in.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.965
Yes, yes, yes.

15:04.967 --> 15:07.164
Oh, God. Chaos.

15:07.166 --> 15:11.000
Chaos! Working in these conditions.
It's utter chaos.

15:12.499 --> 15:15.463
You married a literary entrepreneur.
It's a phenomenal disaster.

15:15.465 --> 15:18.431
You've married a country girl
without a penny to her name.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.334
We're doomed, aren't we?

15:24.566 --> 15:26.965
It's perfect.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.665
But how about, um...

15:28.667 --> 15:34.698
Uh, the contract you sent me is eminently fair,
but for one tiny shortcoming... the money.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.697
Pump it up
before you prick it.

15:36.699 --> 15:38.665
Get more of a pop that way.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.264
Willy!

15:40.266 --> 15:43.631
Intimacy in all its savage
abandon, my darling.

15:43.633 --> 15:46.664
I have meetings later. Let's
meet at La Mascotte at 9:00.

15:46.666 --> 15:49.066
No. No, make it 10:00.

15:55.532 --> 15:59.333
He said, "Don't worry, I've got some cream for that."

16:45.433 --> 16:47.400
Thank you, Madame D'Arsay.

17:05.932 --> 17:08.199
No, you're lying.

17:25.299 --> 17:29.196
That's 571, Lotte,
for one month.

17:29.198 --> 17:30.630
Well, do you want me
to look cheap?

17:30.632 --> 17:33.664
Yeah. But for that money I can get
laid five times a day by a prostitute.

17:38.399 --> 17:40.597
Oh, my dear.

17:40.599 --> 17:42.466
You've come to...
to fetch me?

17:44.666 --> 17:46.630
She's not
a disreputable woman.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.598
They've even written
a play about her.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.397
It was a shit play,
but nevertheless.

17:50.399 --> 17:53.230
- Who the hell wrote that letter?
- I don't care who wrote it.

17:53.232 --> 17:56.930
Look, Gabrielle, she's no rival to you.
I promise.

17:56.932 --> 17:58.397
Look, I'll never sleep
with her again.

17:58.399 --> 18:00.963
But you have to understand,
this is what men do.

18:00.965 --> 18:04.197
We're the weaker sex. We don't have your
strength. We're slave to our urges.

18:04.199 --> 18:06.531
- And here in the city, it's perfectly acceptable to...
- Nonsense!

18:06.533 --> 18:10.330
I don't accept it. You've been
lying to me all this time.

18:10.332 --> 18:12.664
I wait for you all day long
and I never ask you for anything

18:12.666 --> 18:14.230
because you say
we have no money.

18:14.232 --> 18:15.598
But it's true.
We have no money.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.996
Because you spend it all
on her!

18:16.998 --> 18:18.665
- I really don't.
- And then...

18:18.667 --> 18:23.096
And then, when you get into bed
and I touch you, and I kiss you,

18:23.098 --> 18:24.665
and you say
you're too tired...

18:24.667 --> 18:27.063
- No, no.
- I've been unattentive. I'm sorry.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.266
- I'll make amends.
- Don't you dare touch me.

18:31.199 --> 18:33.000
Gabrielle, I...

18:33.700 --> 18:35.531
I gave up my inheritance
for you!

18:35.533 --> 18:39.000
- My bloody freedom!
- Go to hell!

18:44.998 --> 18:47.867
Oh, no. Ants.

18:48.999 --> 18:51.398
Ah, there must be
some honeydew.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.130
It feels sticky.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.931
Hmm. The white flies
must have got to it.

18:55.933 --> 18:57.597
Sucked out all the juice.

18:57.599 --> 18:59.431
We need some ladybirds.

18:59.433 --> 19:01.331
Hmm. Or a spider.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.697
Got a big one
dangling in my room.

19:04.699 --> 19:07.466
I'll catch her and put
her to work out here.

19:13.266 --> 19:16.132
Did you ever feel like you
were playing a part, Sido?

19:17.532 --> 19:19.463
In what way?

19:19.465 --> 19:21.497
As a wife.

19:21.499 --> 19:23.433
Or a mother.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.367
Like you were just
going through with it.

19:30.133 --> 19:33.400
Sometimes, as a wife.
Never as a mother.

19:39.066 --> 19:40.999
Is he good to you,
Gabri?

19:43.300 --> 19:45.267
What is it, my love?

19:46.933 --> 19:51.066
It's just... nothing
is how I imagined it.

19:52.265 --> 19:53.867
Oh. Come here.

19:56.433 --> 19:59.264
My little kitten.

19:59.266 --> 20:02.398
No one can take away
who you are.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.530
No one.

20:04.532 --> 20:06.997
You're too strong
for that.

20:06.999 --> 20:09.033
You always have been.

20:10.533 --> 20:13.263
Just trust no one
but yourself.

20:13.265 --> 20:14.899
I know.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.999
So what's he done
to upset you?

20:21.533 --> 20:23.931
Nothing.

20:23.933 --> 20:27.131
Nothing. It's just
new, that's all.

20:27.133 --> 20:29.199
I must get used to
marriage.

20:32.265 --> 20:35.132
Better to make marriage
get used to you.

20:46.566 --> 20:49.697
- Are you happy to be here?
- Yes.

20:49.699 --> 20:53.463
It makes the city
seem even more foul.

20:53.465 --> 20:55.963
Did you miss me at all?

20:55.965 --> 20:57.433
No, not really.

21:00.966 --> 21:04.434
Well, life is awful
without you.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.964
It's just dead. I... I don't
feel like myself at all.

21:09.966 --> 21:12.133
Everything just seems
utterly pointless.

21:13.532 --> 21:15.433
Can't even write
anymore.

21:18.632 --> 21:22.597
You mean more to me than all the
women of Paris put together.

21:22.599 --> 21:25.430
Have you sampled them all?

21:25.432 --> 21:27.197
Please don't mock me.

21:27.199 --> 21:29.430
You're very happy
to mock everybody else.

21:29.432 --> 21:30.696
It's true,
but it's just...

21:30.698 --> 21:34.697
Look, it's just horseshit. Words
are deceptive little bastards.

21:34.699 --> 21:37.531
But if you trace mine
to their source,

21:37.533 --> 21:39.298
to my bruised
and aching heart...

21:39.300 --> 21:42.263
Well, I wouldn't credit that
as the organ of origin.

21:43.665 --> 21:48.063
I can read you like the top
line of an optician's chart.

21:48.065 --> 21:50.367
That's brilliant.
Did you make that up?

21:53.232 --> 21:55.031
Just tell me what you
want, Gabrielle.

21:55.033 --> 21:56.434
I'll do anything.

21:58.132 --> 22:01.397
I know who you are, Willy.

22:01.399 --> 22:04.564
Maybe I knew it all along.
But I want you not to lie to me.

22:04.566 --> 22:06.932
I won't. Never again. I promise.

22:08.399 --> 22:10.498
I want to be part of things.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.096
I don't want to be treated
like some little wife at home.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.132
I want to know
what's going on.

22:17.666 --> 22:19.133
You will.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.431
You'll be part
of everything.

22:22.433 --> 22:24.033
Do you promise?

22:25.400 --> 22:26.899
Promise.

22:41.199 --> 22:43.930
When we get back to Paris,
I'll even buy you a dog.

22:43.932 --> 22:46.130
I would love that.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.596
Look, it's so beautiful.

22:48.598 --> 22:52.230
- Luce and I used to swim here after school.
- You did?

22:52.232 --> 22:54.130
She was your best friend,
wasn't she?

22:54.132 --> 22:56.931
Yes. We got up to
all kinds of trouble together.

22:56.933 --> 22:58.463
What was she like?

22:58.465 --> 23:02.297
She was sweet, but she
was also very annoying.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.097
How? In what way?

23:04.099 --> 23:06.063
She was clumsy,
more than anything.

23:06.065 --> 23:08.397
One day in winter,
when the first snow started,

23:08.399 --> 23:11.563
I made a compact little snowball and
smuggled it into the classroom.

23:11.565 --> 23:13.996
As Mademoiselle Terrain was
writing on the blackboard,

23:13.998 --> 23:17.097
I'd take a little nibble of the snow and
then I'd pass it along to the next person,

23:17.099 --> 23:18.230
who'd pass it along again.

23:18.232 --> 23:20.997
- Oh, it's freezing.
- Here, get in.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.400
I'm like a pot-bellied stove.

23:26.933 --> 23:28.963
It finally got to Luce,
who dropped it.

23:28.965 --> 23:30.530
So we both got detention.

23:30.532 --> 23:34.963
- She'd do anything to be close to me.
- I'll bet she would.

23:34.965 --> 23:37.267
You're so witty
and clever.

24:07.299 --> 24:09.331
Get out! Both of you!
This is harassment!

24:09.333 --> 24:11.363
Willy, come on.
You're not being fair.

24:11.365 --> 24:13.931
This is the third time I've
had to come here and ask you for it!

24:13.933 --> 24:16.529
- Then stop bloody coming here and asking.
- I am close to being evicted!

24:16.531 --> 24:19.430
You owe me 400 francs. You said you'd
get the advance from Ollendorff.

24:19.432 --> 24:23.130
- And I will, by Friday.
- You said exactly the same thing last week.

24:23.132 --> 24:25.263
A factory needs to pay
its workers, Willy.

24:25.265 --> 24:28.163
Well, then, why don't you go on strike?
Or get another job.

24:28.165 --> 24:30.496
Get some other bloody idiot
to hire you.

24:30.498 --> 24:32.130
I'll have your money
by Friday.

24:32.132 --> 24:36.096
- You'd better bloody have it.
- Such an ass.

24:36.098 --> 24:39.032
- Damn you!
- We'll be back on Friday.

24:43.132 --> 24:45.197
They'd never get a job
on their own.

24:45.199 --> 24:47.333
I lend them my name,
my reputation.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.263
I take all the risk,
and there's still no money.

24:50.265 --> 24:52.497
- We need more output.
- Well, you could get another writer.

24:52.499 --> 24:55.331
And pay them with what? We're not
even making a thousand this month.

24:55.333 --> 24:58.530
I've got 300 from <i>The Echo,</i>
425 from the latest vamp novel,

24:58.532 --> 25:00.530
and just 250
from the music reviews.

25:00.532 --> 25:03.131
- It doesn't even cover the outgoings.
- How can we spend so much money?

25:03.133 --> 25:05.264
The mortgage, Matilde,
restaurants...

25:05.266 --> 25:08.063
You always pick up the bill, Willy,
no matter how many people join us.

25:08.065 --> 25:10.130
- It's expected of me.
- And the races? And the casino?

25:10.132 --> 25:12.364
What do you want me to do? Live
like a monk? Or a peasant?

25:12.366 --> 25:15.398
No, I'm just saying
we could economize.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.000
You.

25:17.966 --> 25:19.398
- You could write.
- What?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.696
Those stories you told me
of Saint-Sauveur last year.

25:21.698 --> 25:24.399
- My school stories?
- Yes. That could be Willy's next novel.

25:26.098 --> 25:28.097
Well, try it anyway, but try it now.

25:28.099 --> 25:32.397
Start immediately. Aim for four hours
at a time. The wolves are at the door!

26:14.598 --> 26:17.429
<i>My name is Claudine.</i>

26:17.431 --> 26:20.396
<i>I live in Montigny.</i>

26:20.398 --> 26:23.133
<i>I was born there in 1873.</i>

26:27.465 --> 26:30.233
<i>I shall probably not die there.</i>

26:44.099 --> 26:46.097
Why aren't you sleeping?

26:46.099 --> 26:48.366
- I've only just stopped writing.
- Really?

26:50.933 --> 26:52.365
Oh, dear.

26:55.498 --> 26:58.529
- Did you manage four hours?
- Twice that, at least.

26:58.531 --> 27:00.133
You didn't.

27:01.364 --> 27:03.664
You must be a natural.

27:03.666 --> 27:07.063
I've changed a few things...
for the story.

27:07.065 --> 27:09.096
I think it might ruffle
a few feathers back home.

27:09.098 --> 27:11.397
Oh, don't worry
about the facts.

27:11.399 --> 27:13.664
You can change events,
add a character.

27:13.666 --> 27:16.298
Just adapt it
to the times.

27:16.300 --> 27:19.264
All people really want
is the feeling,

27:19.266 --> 27:22.031
the emotion, the great
sweep of narrative.

27:22.033 --> 27:24.298
So you mean I can write
whatever I want?

27:24.300 --> 27:26.130
Of course.

27:26.132 --> 27:28.497
No one will dispute it.

27:28.499 --> 27:30.563
And if they do,

27:30.565 --> 27:33.433
"It's the hand that holds the
pen that writes history."

27:43.132 --> 27:44.963
You're not in the mood?

27:44.965 --> 27:47.899
I'm as weary
as a bear in winter.

27:48.965 --> 27:51.132
Save it for the book.

27:57.198 --> 27:59.030
<i>These are the copses,</i>

27:59.032 --> 28:01.930
<i>where bushes spitefully
catch your face as you pass.</i>

28:01.932 --> 28:04.597
<i>Those are full of sun and
strawberries and lilies-of-the-valley</i>

28:04.599 --> 28:06.697
<i>and... snakes.</i>

28:06.699 --> 28:09.362
<i>I've shuddered there
with choking terror</i>

28:09.364 --> 28:13.530
<i>at the sight of those smooth, cold
bodies gliding in front of my feet.</i>

28:13.532 --> 28:15.997
<i>I feel so much alone there,</i>

28:15.999 --> 28:18.296
<i>my eyes lost far away
amongst the trees</i>

28:18.298 --> 28:21.263
<i>in the green,
mysterious daylight</i>

28:21.265 --> 28:25.064
<i>that is at once deliciously
peaceful and a little unnerving</i>

28:25.066 --> 28:27.999
<i>because of the loneliness
and the vague darkness.</i>

29:26.332 --> 29:28.132
Well, here we are.

29:29.232 --> 29:30.597
You did it.

29:30.599 --> 29:33.064
- I take my hat off to you.
- And?

29:33.066 --> 29:36.466
It's beautiful. I spent the
whole day in Saint-Sauveur.

29:37.998 --> 29:39.964
- You don't like it.
- I do like it.

29:39.966 --> 29:41.465
- Truth?
- Yes.

29:43.231 --> 29:45.362
Yes, they're...
they're really charming.

29:45.364 --> 29:47.930
Sorry, I need to...
I need to take a piss.

29:47.932 --> 29:49.931
What else?

29:49.933 --> 29:51.497
Nothing. It's a...

29:51.499 --> 29:53.365
It's a truly
wonderful depiction.

29:54.499 --> 29:56.063
And?

29:56.065 --> 29:58.996
And...

29:58.998 --> 30:00.997
we won't be able
to get it published.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.131
That's the shame of it.

30:03.133 --> 30:04.900
What's wrong with it?

30:06.631 --> 30:08.233
Honestly?

30:12.699 --> 30:16.530
So I'll treat you like any other writer
I'm giving a report to, shall I?

30:16.532 --> 30:18.363
- Yes.
- Except that I love you.

30:18.365 --> 30:20.430
I adore you.
Should be clear about that.

30:20.432 --> 30:22.199
Just... Just say it.

30:25.332 --> 30:29.262
There's nothing driving it.
There's no plot.

30:29.264 --> 30:33.032
A novel by Willy grips you from
chapter one, whereas yours...

30:33.699 --> 30:35.397
There's
too many adjectives.

30:35.399 --> 30:37.429
And some of the characters
are interesting,

30:37.431 --> 30:41.363
but... it's too cloying.

30:41.365 --> 30:43.132
It's too feminine.

30:45.532 --> 30:48.396
- Well, that's a waste of bloody time.
- Not if you enjoyed it.

30:48.398 --> 30:50.232
I wrote it for you!

He's the king of the cantomime.
Let's get a drink.

32:33.197 --> 32:35.363
Thank you, Geraud.

32:35.365 --> 32:37.199
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32:38.932 --> 32:41.597
- How's it going with your book?
- It's gone.

32:41.599 --> 32:44.596
- I tried, but it wasn't any good.
- I can't believe it.

32:44.598 --> 32:47.397
Willy hated it.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.530
I don't care.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.465
- I don't need to leave my mark on the world.
- Hmm.

32:54.665 --> 32:58.063
- Have you always written, Schwob?
- I didn't really have a choice.

32:58.065 --> 33:00.297
It was simply there.

33:00.299 --> 33:03.931
- Does it make you happy?
- Oh, God, no.

33:03.933 --> 33:06.296
I do it to prevent me
from going mad.

33:06.298 --> 33:11.998
But sometimes, occasionally,
it will transport me.

33:12.666 --> 33:14.663
- Hello, Schwob.
- Hello, Gaston.

33:14.665 --> 33:16.266
Good to see you.

33:17.565 --> 33:21.496
Jeanne,
may I present Colette?

33:21.498 --> 33:23.163
Madame.

33:23.165 --> 33:26.563
I think we've been introduced,
but I don't remember that name.

33:26.565 --> 33:29.062
It's new,
in a manner of speaking.

33:29.064 --> 33:33.329
Well, then I shall think of
this as our first meeting.

33:38.032 --> 33:41.930
It is so easy.
On. Off.

33:41.932 --> 33:44.029
No more sooty candles.

33:44.031 --> 33:46.530
Yes, maybe they'll put it
in my building one day.

33:46.532 --> 33:50.629
So much safer too, even if the
light is a little unkind.

33:50.631 --> 33:53.131
Nonsense.
Will you excuse me, Arman?

34:16.532 --> 34:19.563
Yes, so, I thought it
was much better than last time.

34:19.565 --> 34:23.530
Let me see your palm.
Oh, how interesting.

34:23.532 --> 34:26.297
You have a long life line.

34:26.299 --> 34:29.228
And a very strong
head line here.

34:29.231 --> 34:32.995
- And your... your love line splits into three.
- Oh.

34:32.996 --> 34:35.297
- What on earth could that mean?
- Who knows?

34:35.299 --> 34:37.596
So many intersecting lines.

34:37.598 --> 34:38.963
I have the hands
of a man. Look.

34:38.965 --> 34:40.596
- Ah.
- See?

34:40.598 --> 34:43.094
You've a touch
of Hermes, Colette.

34:43.097 --> 34:45.929
There's something androgynous about you.

34:45.931 --> 34:48.262
- Willy, you ogre, how are you?
- Gaston, Jeanne.

34:48.264 --> 34:50.597
We have been greatly enjoying
the company of Colette,

34:50.599 --> 34:53.129
now that she's no longer hiding
her light under a bushel.

34:53.130 --> 34:54.429
Quoting the good book,
Gaston?

34:54.431 --> 34:57.230
You may remember a little verse
about coveting other men's wives.

34:57.232 --> 35:01.030
And you may remember one about not trying
to remove a speck from your brother's eye

35:01.032 --> 35:03.030
with a log in your own.

35:03.032 --> 35:06.096
Touché, Gaston. Your wits
are improving... somewhat.

35:06.098 --> 35:07.432
Ah, we'd better go now,
darling.

35:09.031 --> 35:10.932
We should go now.

35:13.165 --> 35:15.995
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

35:15.997 --> 35:18.529
His first play
was absolute rubbish,

35:18.531 --> 35:22.129
but his mother runs a salon, so,
of course, it was a huge success

35:22.131 --> 35:25.497
and he was praised to the skies
for his brilliant writing

35:25.499 --> 35:27.996
and his sublime talent.

35:27.998 --> 35:30.229
Unctuous prick.
He was after you.

35:30.231 --> 35:32.363
He's not the type,
and they just got married.

35:32.365 --> 35:35.596
Yeah, well, they're no longer on
honeymoon, I assure you, my dear.

35:35.598 --> 35:38.332
- Your jealousy is misplaced.
- How so?

35:39.997 --> 35:41.898
It was the wife
I found interesting.

35:42.498 --> 35:43.430
Jeanne?

35:43.432 --> 35:44.399
Yes.

35:50.164 --> 35:52.233
What would you think
of that?

35:53.498 --> 35:55.132
Well, that's...

35:57.032 --> 35:58.596
that's a different case.

35:58.598 --> 36:00.232
It is?

36:02.399 --> 36:03.998
Perhaps.

36:11.364 --> 36:14.062
Good morning, ma'am. I need to speak
to the gentleman of the house.

36:14.064 --> 36:16.529
- What is it?
- Monsieur Henri Gauthier-Villars.

36:16.531 --> 36:18.330
Is he in?

36:18.332 --> 36:21.129
- You can speak to me about whatever it is.
- Sorry, ma'am.

36:21.131 --> 36:22.563
- Ah. Sir.
- What is it?

36:22.565 --> 36:27.131
I have a repossession order for two
armchairs, one armoire, one oak desk.

36:28.498 --> 36:31.198
- Let me see the court papers.
- Here you are.

36:32.265 --> 36:33.596
All in order?

36:33.598 --> 36:35.496
Come on.

36:35.498 --> 36:38.096
- Willy!
- It's just bits of wood.

36:38.098 --> 36:40.596
- The armoire's in the bedroom.
- With my clothes in it.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.998
You empty it out.
I'll see to the desk.

36:47.932 --> 36:49.999
Oh, be careful.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.697
You ready?

37:15.699 --> 37:18.065
Yes. Take it away.

37:33.165 --> 37:36.562
So here, it's, like, "It's
a lovely spring morning."

37:36.564 --> 37:38.263
You know,
liven it up a bit.

37:38.265 --> 37:40.995
How about, "Perhaps it's the season.
It's glorious.

37:40.997 --> 37:44.199
The sap is rising
almost indecently."

37:45.399 --> 37:47.529
And then, yeah, here,

37:47.531 --> 37:49.596
the scene with Luce.

37:49.598 --> 37:52.397
I've written, "She brushed
up against me suggestively,

37:52.399 --> 37:56.496
her blue eyes half closed
and her mouth half open."

37:56.498 --> 37:58.663
A little louche.

37:58.665 --> 38:02.130
Louche sells, trust me. We need
more spice, less literature.

38:02.132 --> 38:04.130
I know what men want.
So do the publishers.

38:04.132 --> 38:06.329
- Do you really think they'll take it?
- Yes.

38:06.331 --> 38:09.529
- Ollendorff will go nuts for it.
- As you did on first reading?

38:09.531 --> 38:12.898
Never mind about that. Come on. We've
got to work. Work, work, work.

38:28.231 --> 38:33.130
"Claudine is a girl from a small
village, yet she is all of us.

38:33.132 --> 38:36.930
Feisty, opinionated,
selfish, and sensual..."

38:36.932 --> 38:38.262
Ooh!

38:38.264 --> 38:41.330
"She astounds us
with her moxie, her desires,

38:41.332 --> 38:42.530
and her crimes."

38:42.532 --> 38:45.196
Oh!

38:45.198 --> 38:49.995
"It took an extraordinary man to
define this modern young woman."

38:49.997 --> 38:53.130
Willy, your book
will change the world.

38:53.132 --> 38:55.998
- To Claudine!
- To Claudine!

38:56.531 --> 38:58.130
Claudine!

38:58.132 --> 39:00.663
All of Paris is saying
your husband is a genius.

39:00.665 --> 39:03.029
- And what do you say?
- He is.

39:03.031 --> 39:06.162
If that book
is anything to go by.

39:06.164 --> 39:07.930
Look at him.

39:07.932 --> 39:09.663
I haven't seen him that
happy in a long time.

39:13.499 --> 39:18.195
Well, I have to say, Willy, we've never had
one fly off the shelves like this before.

39:18.197 --> 39:21.963
Quite a phenomenon.
Everyone's talking about it.

39:21.965 --> 39:23.529
And do you know
who's buying it?

39:23.531 --> 39:26.263
- Young women.
- Really?

39:26.265 --> 39:27.995
I thought that...

39:27.997 --> 39:29.463
That's interesting.

39:29.465 --> 39:32.163
We've also been having inquiries
about theatrical rights.

39:32.165 --> 39:34.696
- Any thoughts?
- Of course.

39:34.698 --> 39:36.662
The theater's
the next logical step.

39:36.664 --> 39:38.596
With as large a stage
as possible.

39:38.598 --> 39:41.263
It's the theater-going public
who will make you rich, Willy.

39:41.265 --> 39:43.662
Maybe even as rich as you one
day, my dear Ollendorff.

39:43.664 --> 39:46.330
What size of print run?

39:46.332 --> 39:48.296
Perhaps 30,000 units.

39:48.298 --> 39:53.095
I'm waiting to see what sort of
advances the booksellers have got.

39:53.097 --> 39:55.095
What return
will that yield?

39:55.097 --> 39:57.561
About three francs per unit.

39:57.563 --> 40:00.232
So, yes, it's a tidy sum.

40:01.563 --> 40:03.398
Madame Willy.

40:04.964 --> 40:06.529
- An honor.
- Pleasure to meet you.

40:06.531 --> 40:09.530
Listen, <i>Claudine at School</i> is
heading for her third printing.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.262
Excellent.

40:11.264 --> 40:13.561
I believe Willy based Claudine
in part on your school days.

40:13.563 --> 40:16.930
Yes, I think I had a little
something to contribute.

40:16.932 --> 40:21.130
Well, I'm very glad your experiences
have borne such wonderful fruit.

40:21.132 --> 40:23.130
Very nice to meet you,
madame.

40:23.132 --> 40:25.562
- Gare de Lyon, please.
- Where are we going?

40:25.564 --> 40:27.398
You'll find out.

40:30.232 --> 40:31.198
Hup.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.266
Is something wrong?

40:37.332 --> 40:39.433
Well, wh-what
do you think is wrong?

40:40.665 --> 40:42.265
What?

40:44.231 --> 40:46.263
Finally
we have a success,

40:46.265 --> 40:49.195
and then you imply that I'm
not the true author of it.

40:49.197 --> 40:52.063
- No, I didn't.
- We're holding dynamite here.

40:52.065 --> 40:54.230
We've created something
really powerful,

40:54.232 --> 40:56.030
and if it goes off
at the wrong time,

40:56.032 --> 40:57.595
then it could blow
our bloody heads off.

40:57.597 --> 40:59.263
Ollendorff is
your publisher, Willy.

40:59.265 --> 41:01.029
Yeah, well, Schwob
also said something.

41:01.031 --> 41:03.998
- Schwob is part of the factory.
- People love to talk.

41:05.964 --> 41:09.329
They praise you to your face. Then the moment
you turn around there's knives in your back.

41:09.331 --> 41:11.396
I understand the mentality here.
You don't.

41:11.398 --> 41:14.995
Well, I understand it well enough to
write a book that's the toast of Paris.

41:14.997 --> 41:17.996
Oh, well, why don't you... Go and
just shout it on the streets then.

41:17.998 --> 41:20.432
Tell everybody.
Roll up for the massacre.

41:24.998 --> 41:27.132
I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

41:29.531 --> 41:31.131
I'm sorry.

41:32.398 --> 41:34.932
Perhaps I overreacted.

41:35.965 --> 41:38.365
Anyway, I...
I have a surprise for you.

41:40.298 --> 41:42.162
What is it?

41:42.164 --> 41:44.998
Well, then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

41:46.697 --> 41:48.495
So what's that one?

41:48.497 --> 41:50.132
Lime.

41:52.431 --> 41:54.262
And that one?

41:54.264 --> 41:56.031
It's a Douglas fir.

41:58.964 --> 42:00.596
How about that one?

42:00.598 --> 42:03.432
Chestnut.
It's a weeping chestnut.

42:06.332 --> 42:08.595
I don't know why
you're so keen on nature.

42:08.597 --> 42:11.029
Animals are vile
to each other.

42:11.031 --> 42:14.063
Animals are honest at least.
They never lie.

42:14.065 --> 42:18.131
Yes, my dear. Well, that's
because they don't speak.

42:20.298 --> 42:22.363
Look at that.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.996
Mmm. It's beautiful.

42:24.998 --> 42:27.032
I wonder
who lives there.

42:28.197 --> 42:30.865
I'm thirsty. Let's see
if they'll stand us a drink.

42:31.664 --> 42:33.898
Willy,
they might shoot us.

42:49.198 --> 42:51.695
Look, wait.
They might be upstairs.

42:51.697 --> 42:53.496
Or deaf.

42:53.498 --> 42:56.462
- Deafened by all this country silence!
- Shh.

42:56.464 --> 42:58.196
I thought
I heard something.

42:58.198 --> 42:58.963
Kiss me.

42:58.965 --> 43:01.932
- Willy, someone might come.
- Good.

43:07.231 --> 43:09.229
Put your hand
in my pocket.

43:09.231 --> 43:11.362
- There's something there for you.
- Willy.

43:11.364 --> 43:13.865
What?

43:22.932 --> 43:24.365
Allow me.

43:41.997 --> 43:43.998
What do you think?

43:45.131 --> 43:47.561
I don't know what I think.

43:47.563 --> 43:50.529
- Whose house is it?
- It's for you.

43:50.531 --> 43:52.962
My love. My heart.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.364
Lest Paris
should drive you mad.

43:56.563 --> 43:59.296
- What?
- It's yours.

43:59.298 --> 44:02.331
You're always talking about how
much you miss the countryside.

44:04.430 --> 44:07.029
I don't believe it.

44:07.031 --> 44:09.431
Somewhere for you
to write and be alone.

44:11.363 --> 44:12.998
So...

44:15.597 --> 44:17.562
where did you get
the money?

44:17.564 --> 44:20.963
I got an advance
from Ollendorff.

44:20.965 --> 44:23.962
- 25,000 francs.
- For what?

44:23.964 --> 44:25.996
For the next book.

44:25.998 --> 44:28.063
- <i>Claudine in Paris.</i>
- Willy, I-I...

44:28.065 --> 44:30.663
- I can't write another Claudine.
- Just write about us.

44:30.665 --> 44:33.461
Our lives. Our friends. Change
the names and make gossip.

44:33.463 --> 44:35.998
- No, Willy, it...
- Let's talk about the details later.

44:40.064 --> 44:42.131
So, do you like it?

44:43.531 --> 44:45.263
It's indescribable.

44:45.265 --> 44:46.562
No such word.

44:46.564 --> 44:50.031
A good writer should be able to
describe anything no matter what.

45:25.664 --> 45:27.264
Is this it?

45:28.998 --> 45:31.132
Your total output
for all these weeks?

45:32.965 --> 45:35.228
I've been doing the house.

45:35.230 --> 45:38.628
All the repairs,
the painting, the tiling.

45:38.630 --> 45:40.696
Planting the garden.

45:40.698 --> 45:43.262
Bugger the garden.
We have a deadline.

45:43.264 --> 45:46.332
Well, it's actually quite difficult
to write out here... alone.

45:47.697 --> 45:50.462
And I don't want to write
another Claudine.

45:50.464 --> 45:53.629
Are you out of your mind? Do you
realize how rare this moment is?

45:53.631 --> 45:56.132
When people
are begging for more?

45:58.932 --> 46:00.332
Here, come with me.

46:06.397 --> 46:10.362
What would the headmaster do if
Claudine had not done her homework?

46:10.364 --> 46:12.262
Willy, don't be silly.

46:12.264 --> 46:14.129
What would he do?

46:14.131 --> 46:17.529
Make her do lines. Put her over
his knee and tan her hide.

46:17.531 --> 46:19.131
Correct.

46:20.330 --> 46:22.432
I'll start tomorrow.

46:24.132 --> 46:25.432
Willy.

46:26.464 --> 46:29.130
- Write!
- Willy, let me out!

46:29.132 --> 46:31.995
You will do as I say.
I'll return in four hours.

46:31.997 --> 46:34.096
- I expect to see some pages.
- Willy!

46:34.098 --> 46:36.132
Willy, come on.
This isn't funny.

46:38.098 --> 46:41.528
Willy!
Willy, you bastard!

46:41.530 --> 46:45.329
You arrogant bastard!
Let me out!

46:45.331 --> 46:46.962
Willy!

46:46.964 --> 46:49.194
Open the door!

46:49.196 --> 46:50.398
Let me out!

48:16.097 --> 48:18.397
Oh, thank you so much.

48:30.697 --> 48:32.898
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

48:44.464 --> 48:46.429
Colette
and Willy are here.

48:46.431 --> 48:48.065
So they are.

48:48.697 --> 48:50.396
Don't stare.

48:50.398 --> 48:51.663
- Sorry.
- Here?

48:51.665 --> 48:53.365
Yes. Perfect.

48:55.264 --> 48:56.398
Thank you.

48:58.698 --> 49:00.529
Mmm. It's delicious.

49:00.531 --> 49:02.195
Mmm.

49:02.197 --> 49:04.362
Tell me,

49:04.364 --> 49:06.996
how many people
in this park right now

49:06.998 --> 49:09.065
do you think are reading
<i>Claudine in Paris?</i>

49:10.965 --> 49:13.262
- I don't know.
- I'd say at least three-quarters.

49:13.264 --> 49:16.232
And the rest of them
will soon catch up.

49:19.497 --> 49:21.365
What comes here?

49:23.231 --> 49:25.328
Monsieur Willy.
Madame Colette.

49:25.330 --> 49:27.997
- I have a note for you.
- Thank you very much.

49:28.932 --> 49:30.629
Mrs. Raoul Duval.

49:30.631 --> 49:32.528
Oh, Georgie Raoul Duval?

49:32.530 --> 49:34.194
- Yes.
- Wonderful.

49:34.196 --> 49:37.361
Please thank your mistress
and say we accept the invitation

49:37.363 --> 49:39.361
and look forward
to her delightful company.

49:39.363 --> 49:40.997
- Thank you.
- I will.

49:43.196 --> 49:45.994
- Who is she?
- Ah, she's an American.

49:45.996 --> 49:51.161
She's a wayward debutante
from Louisiana

49:51.163 --> 49:56.029
who married a munitions
magnate three times her age.

49:56.031 --> 49:57.628
They sound dull.

49:57.630 --> 50:01.129
He is,
but she's anything but.

50:01.131 --> 50:03.663
We don't have to go
if you don't want to.

50:03.665 --> 50:05.663
No, let's go.

50:08.964 --> 50:11.228
That's so funny.
Did he really say that?

50:11.230 --> 50:14.029
Of course he did.
He's such a colossal snob.

50:14.031 --> 50:18.128
Then Madame de Caillavet happened to mention
that he was only a baron, not a marquise.

50:18.130 --> 50:20.161
"Forgive me, madam,"
he replied,

50:20.163 --> 50:22.995
"but I'm also the duke of
Anjou, the bishop of Coutances,

50:22.997 --> 50:26.262
the prince of Joinville,
of Orléans, and the Dunes.

50:26.264 --> 50:28.396
None of which is of the
slightest importance here."

50:32.963 --> 50:34.899
Oh, look.

50:36.397 --> 50:37.264
There.

50:39.463 --> 50:40.898
That's better.

50:47.031 --> 50:49.561
- Oh, is the evening over already?
- Thank you, monsieur.

50:49.563 --> 50:51.295
I can't bear it.

50:51.297 --> 50:53.628
Oh, Lily, tell the coachman
to go and ready the carriage.

50:53.630 --> 50:55.231
Of course.

50:56.163 --> 50:57.595
Well?

50:57.597 --> 51:01.296
I'm sorry, ma'am, but, Monsieur Willy,
may I have your autograph, please?

51:01.298 --> 51:02.995
Of course you can.

51:02.997 --> 51:05.131
Here, I'll even do
a picture for you.

51:06.964 --> 51:08.395
- There you are.
- Thank you so much.

51:08.397 --> 51:10.462
- And yours too, Madame Colette.
- Oh, come now.

51:10.464 --> 51:14.031
No, of course. Spirit
should always be rewarded.

51:16.630 --> 51:18.596
Thank you.

51:18.598 --> 51:20.997
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

51:23.598 --> 51:26.162
Well,

51:26.164 --> 51:31.131
I live at 74 Rue Goethe if you'd
like to stop by for a nightcap.

51:33.063 --> 51:36.061
I think I'd better retire
for the night.

51:36.063 --> 51:38.262
Oh. Are you sure now?

51:38.264 --> 51:41.328
- Willy?
- We'll play again soon, my dear.

51:41.330 --> 51:45.228
Yes, I hope so, before
my bore of a husband returns.

51:46.564 --> 51:49.195
Well, au revoir.

51:49.197 --> 51:50.998
Au revoir.

51:57.530 --> 51:59.261
You don't want to go?

51:59.263 --> 52:02.331
Well, the invitation
was clearly meant for you.

52:04.197 --> 52:07.197
- Should I?
- Yes, of course.

52:07.964 --> 52:09.628
You don't mind?

52:09.630 --> 52:13.396
Well, it would be hypocritical
of me if I did, wouldn't it?

52:13.398 --> 52:17.162
You can comfort yourself knowing
that I will be at home lying in bed,

52:17.164 --> 52:20.130
thinking of the two of you
in the fondest way possible.

52:50.598 --> 52:52.898
Come on in.

52:57.031 --> 52:58.995
It's a nice place.

52:58.997 --> 53:01.464
Thank you. It's my
little pied-à-terre.

53:02.996 --> 53:05.496
Frederick's not so keen
on the art nouveau pieces,

53:05.498 --> 53:08.364
but I love nature...

53:09.497 --> 53:11.129
and women.

53:11.131 --> 53:14.596
I can see.

53:14.598 --> 53:19.129
I remember in <i>Claudine at School</i> when all
the girls go swimming together at night.

53:19.131 --> 53:21.628
Night is the best time
for a swim.

53:21.630 --> 53:25.362
When I was a girl, I was told that all
the lakes in Louisiana have alligators,

53:25.364 --> 53:31.162
so I never went for a midnight
swim, but I regret it.

53:31.164 --> 53:33.194
When you raise your eyelids,

53:33.196 --> 53:35.898
it's as if you are taking off
all my clothes.

53:37.397 --> 53:39.332
Don't look away.

53:40.398 --> 53:42.432
Look at me.

53:43.563 --> 53:45.264
Look at me looking at you.

53:55.196 --> 53:58.628
You have
the most beautiful teeth.

53:58.630 --> 54:00.464
Like an alligator.

54:19.531 --> 54:21.396
Morning, my dear.

54:21.398 --> 54:24.062
Have you fed Toby Chien?

54:24.064 --> 54:27.231
Oh, I forgot.
I thought Matilde does that.

54:32.130 --> 54:34.329
So how was last night?

54:34.331 --> 54:35.596
Interesting.

54:35.598 --> 54:37.995
What happened?

54:37.997 --> 54:40.194
What do you think
happened?

54:40.196 --> 54:43.528
Ah. Well, don't tell me.
I'll, uh...

54:43.530 --> 54:47.461
I'll wait to read about it, when Claudine
develops tender feelings towards a lady friend.

54:47.463 --> 54:50.195
- I'm not writing about it.
- You must. It's prime material.

54:50.197 --> 54:51.395
No.

54:51.397 --> 54:53.265
Will you see her again?

54:54.331 --> 54:55.997
Possibly.

55:04.631 --> 55:07.030
One moment, my darlin'.

55:19.364 --> 55:21.661
- Oh.
- Wonderful. You're... You're here.

55:21.663 --> 55:24.228
I...
I was just passing by.

55:24.230 --> 55:25.331
Yes?

55:26.930 --> 55:28.364
Well, um...

55:31.564 --> 55:33.364
You'd better come in.

55:44.598 --> 55:46.395
How's the writing going?

55:46.397 --> 55:48.429
It's slow and painful.

55:48.431 --> 55:51.295
- How was your meeting at the bank?
- It was good.

55:51.297 --> 55:52.998
Yeah, it was good.

56:30.663 --> 56:32.897
She's expecting you.

56:44.498 --> 56:46.264
Off to the bank.

57:02.664 --> 57:04.997
Georgie,
I know you're in there!

57:06.529 --> 57:08.231
Georgie, open up!

57:10.063 --> 57:12.062
Colette,
I was taking a nap.

57:12.064 --> 57:14.194
- Where is he?
- Who?

57:14.196 --> 57:16.231
Colette, what are
you talking about?

57:19.996 --> 57:22.295
<i>Blue cigar
smoke hung in the air.</i>

57:22.297 --> 57:25.296
<i>I marched in and looked
straight in the face of Renaud.</i>

57:25.298 --> 57:28.095
<i>He recoiled, saying, "It was wicked of me.
I'm sorry."</i>

57:28.097 --> 57:30.129
<i>Rezi was there.
Of course she was there...</i>

57:30.131 --> 57:32.594
"Of course she was there,
hurriedly dressing herself.

57:32.596 --> 57:36.129
I shall always remember her
lily-white face decomposing,

57:36.131 --> 57:38.930
as if it were dying
right under my gaze."

57:42.331 --> 57:44.495
It's good.

57:44.497 --> 57:46.231
I know.

57:47.831 --> 57:51.560
I'd suggest you change the line where Renaud
says, "It was wicked of me to do it,"

57:51.562 --> 57:52.927
but I know you won't.

57:52.929 --> 57:56.395
And what do you think that Renaud
would say in those circumstances?

57:56.397 --> 57:59.396
I don't know. Something like, "Why,
my dear, we were waiting for you."

57:59.398 --> 58:03.261
- I don't think she'd believe him.
- Of course not.

58:03.263 --> 58:06.560
But don't you think
she's being hypocritical?

58:06.562 --> 58:09.128
I mean, it's acceptable for
Claudine to sleep with Rezi,

58:09.130 --> 58:11.094
but she doesn't want Renaud
to do the same.

58:11.096 --> 58:13.130
Not behind her back,
no.

58:14.664 --> 58:16.494
The betrayal came
when Renaud lied to her.

58:16.496 --> 58:19.264
Renaud, who swore he
would always be honest.

58:22.497 --> 58:25.595
Well, perhaps he wanted
to tell her, but he was...

58:25.597 --> 58:28.162
frightened
of her volcanic jealousy.

58:28.164 --> 58:30.898
Well, then, he was a
coward as well as a liar.

58:32.530 --> 58:34.528
You're very harsh on him.

58:34.530 --> 58:36.464
If not me,
who else?

58:39.131 --> 58:40.928
And Renaud
would never be jealous

58:40.930 --> 58:43.029
if, for example,

58:43.031 --> 58:45.997
Claudine went off with a
young man for a change.

58:49.497 --> 58:51.527
He would find that
unacceptable.

58:51.529 --> 58:53.396
Oh.

58:53.398 --> 58:56.395
- Infidelity for Renaud is a matter of gender?
- Yes, it is.

58:56.397 --> 58:57.430
Huh.

58:58.930 --> 59:01.528
How long have you known?

59:01.530 --> 59:03.494
About a month.

59:03.496 --> 59:06.430
Well, I must say, I'm impressed by
the way you've handled yourself.

59:07.629 --> 59:10.029
A younger Claudine
would have thrown a fit.

59:10.031 --> 59:12.395
I'm planning on killing
Renaud off in the next one.

59:12.397 --> 59:14.695
What? No, you can't.
No, please, don't.

59:14.697 --> 59:17.898
The hand that holds
the pen writes history.

59:25.664 --> 59:27.461
My husband,

59:27.463 --> 59:30.328
he's just... pure rage.

59:30.330 --> 59:32.628
He wanted to challenge Willy
to a duel.

59:32.630 --> 59:34.394
What?

59:34.396 --> 59:37.430
I put him off. Hopefully
it won't come to that.

59:39.530 --> 59:41.365
You've read it, yes?

59:42.397 --> 59:43.595
I have.

59:43.597 --> 59:45.362
How worried should I be?

59:45.364 --> 59:47.395
It's not blatantly obvious
who is who.

59:47.397 --> 59:49.527
- The names have been changed.
- I don't believe you.

59:49.529 --> 59:53.130
Everyone's chattering about it, saying
it will be salacious in the extreme.

59:54.463 --> 59:57.961
I know that you have no time
for me since our separation,

59:57.963 --> 01:00:01.328
and I know
I behaved badly.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:02.997
But I'm begging you.

01:00:04.197 --> 01:00:07.395
Ask Willy to change it
before publication.

01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:09.361
Please, Colette.

01:00:09.363 --> 01:00:10.528
One woman to another.

01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:12.528
I can't.

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.128
You'd let me suffer?

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.995
It isn't just Willy,
Georgie.

01:00:16.997 --> 01:00:19.494
It... It's...
It's the book itself.

01:00:19.496 --> 01:00:21.363
Willy thinks
it's a work of art.

01:00:29.231 --> 01:00:31.395
You had your chance
to be decent,

01:00:31.397 --> 01:00:34.528
but now it will be left to
my husband to settle it.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:39.360
Ollendorff has agreed to a lump sum for
the destruction of the entire print run.

01:00:39.362 --> 01:00:40.430
What?

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:43.295
You can't do that.

01:00:43.297 --> 01:00:44.695
He's already accepted.

01:00:44.697 --> 01:00:46.994
That sly bastard.
You can't. You just can't.

01:00:46.996 --> 01:00:49.128
Well, we have,
and that's how it is.

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.231
- You duplicitous bitch.
- I had a good teacher.

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:17.194
And like
a true French heroine,

01:01:17.196 --> 01:01:19.394
our daughter Claudine
was burnt at the stake.

01:01:19.396 --> 01:01:22.129
I said it would be a hot book.

01:01:22.131 --> 01:01:24.527
The thing is,
Ollendorff signed the deal,

01:01:24.529 --> 01:01:28.161
but he neglected to mention that
he does not own the copyright.

01:01:28.163 --> 01:01:30.228
- Because I do.
- Unbelievable.

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:33.427
So it was simply a question of
trotting along to the next publisher,

01:01:33.429 --> 01:01:35.494
collecting
a second advance,

01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:37.528
and the printing presses are
hard at work as we speak.

01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:39.428
How do you two do it?

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:43.395
- I think we got very lucky.
- Not at all. We are with the times.

01:01:43.397 --> 01:01:48.260
That cuckolded millionaire and his
voracious wife didn't stand a chance.

01:01:48.262 --> 01:01:51.062
We've got the wind under our
wings, and I have a little plan

01:01:51.064 --> 01:01:54.627
to turn Claudine into the most popular
girl in France, if not the entire world.

01:01:54.629 --> 01:01:57.264
She will literally be
a household name.

01:01:58.931 --> 01:02:01.662
My name is Claudine.
I live in Montigny.

01:02:01.664 --> 01:02:04.929
I was born there in 1884.

01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:07.261
- She's not bad.
- I shall probably not die there.

01:02:07.263 --> 01:02:10.327
- Montigny is a village, not a town.
- She's terrible.

01:02:10.329 --> 01:02:12.995
Its streets, thank
heaven, are not paved.

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:15.998
Yes, you're right.
Th-Thank you very much.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:24.161
My name is Claudine.
I live in Montigny.

01:02:24.163 --> 01:02:26.461
I was born there
in 1884.

01:02:26.463 --> 01:02:28.662
I shall probably not
die there.

01:02:28.664 --> 01:02:30.995
Montigny is a village,
not a town.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.628
Monsieur Willy. I am the real Claudine.

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.128
- And you are...?
- Me?

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:38.661
- My name is Polaire.
- Polaire?

01:02:38.663 --> 01:02:41.528
Polaire.
Pride of Algiers.

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.495
Look at her.

01:02:43.497 --> 01:02:45.128
I mean, look at her.
She's...

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:47.095
She instinctively
knows the role.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.361
- She talks about the book as if it was a religion.
- Yes.

01:02:50.363 --> 01:02:52.897
She's a Sister of Perpetual Claudine.

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:55.294
It's strange.

01:02:55.296 --> 01:02:59.231
She's started copying my
gestures and mannerisms.

01:03:00.329 --> 01:03:03.095
- Really?
- Do you think I could act?

01:03:03.097 --> 01:03:05.395
You? No.
It'd be a criminal waste.

01:03:05.397 --> 01:03:06.662
Waste of what?

01:03:06.664 --> 01:03:10.227
This bobbed haircut. I've never
seen anything like it. Have you?

01:03:10.229 --> 01:03:12.864
I always imagined Claudine
with long hair.

01:03:14.097 --> 01:03:17.528
Well, that was 19th-century Claudine.
This is now.

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:19.395
Look good on you,
actually.

01:03:19.397 --> 01:03:21.194
Very fetching.

01:03:21.196 --> 01:03:24.461
Just think of it. You and
Polaire, the Claudine twins.

01:03:24.463 --> 01:03:27.193
- What?
- Yeah. It'd be a publicity gold mine.

01:03:27.195 --> 01:03:30.130
- Paris would be all atwitter.
- No. Not in a thousand years.

01:03:33.697 --> 01:03:35.331
Evening.

01:03:59.129 --> 01:04:01.997
Colette.
You look ravishing.

01:04:02.496 --> 01:04:04.130
Thank you.

01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:23.064
My name is Claudine.

01:04:24.296 --> 01:04:26.428
I live in Montigny.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:29.898
I was born there
in 1884.

01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:33.995
I shall probably not
die there.

01:04:33.997 --> 01:04:37.460
Of all my novels, this was the one
that would translate to the theater.

01:04:37.462 --> 01:04:40.062
I have to give it to you, Willy.
It's a huge success.

01:04:40.064 --> 01:04:43.527
But now you're such a celebrity, you'll
become even more insufferable than ever.

01:04:43.529 --> 01:04:46.995
That's the plan, Veber. That's the plan.

01:04:46.997 --> 01:04:49.128
Oh, he is a tease.

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:51.461
Can you believe
this crowd?

01:04:51.463 --> 01:04:54.427
Look. Everyone's here. Look.
There's the marquise de Belbeuf.

01:04:54.429 --> 01:04:58.494
Or Missy, as she's known. She only
shows up for very special occasions.

01:04:58.496 --> 01:05:00.461
A woman?

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:03.028
Descended from Empress
Josephine on one side,

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.394
the czar of Russia
on the other.

01:05:05.396 --> 01:05:08.527
That's how she gets away with
the trousers, even in public.

01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:10.230
Fascinating.

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.527
Stunning.

01:05:19.529 --> 01:05:21.594
Subtle as ever.

01:05:39.663 --> 01:05:42.028
Monsieur Willy.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:44.528
- How was it?
- You were magnificent.

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:45.994
You were perfection.

01:05:45.996 --> 01:05:48.330
Thank you, Monsieur Willy.

01:05:49.497 --> 01:05:50.661
Colette?

01:05:50.663 --> 01:05:54.230
You are her.
The living Claudine.

01:05:55.596 --> 01:05:57.929
Polaire,
alight here on my knee.

01:05:57.931 --> 01:06:00.428
Tetette, you too.

01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.064
- Willy...
- Come here.

01:06:05.463 --> 01:06:07.260
Behold
the Claudine trinity.

01:06:07.262 --> 01:06:10.661
The father, the mother
and the daughter.

01:06:10.663 --> 01:06:12.196
Look over here, please.

01:06:15.462 --> 01:06:17.261
Claudine, she is a Midas minx,

01:06:17.263 --> 01:06:19.395
her smile mysterious
like a sphinx.

01:06:19.397 --> 01:06:21.260
She walks, she talks,
she even thinks.

01:06:21.262 --> 01:06:23.228
Claudine,
Claudine, Claudine!

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.193
Claudine's a
girl who knows no bounds,

01:06:25.195 --> 01:06:26.994
a fox that can't be
caught by hounds.

01:06:26.996 --> 01:06:29.294
Exploding star
that makes no sound!

01:06:29.296 --> 01:06:31.194
Claudine, Claudine, Claudine!

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.261
- Who is this girl in my heart?
- Claudine!

01:06:33.263 --> 01:06:35.228
- Who has been right from the start?
- Claudine!

01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.527
- Who is a bit of a tart?
- Claudine, Claudine, Claudine!

01:06:37.529 --> 01:06:39.128
Claudine!

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.128
- Who is the girl I admire?
- Claudine!

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.560
- Who is the queen of desire?
- Claudine!

01:06:42.562 --> 01:06:44.361
Who has set Paris
on fire?

01:06:44.363 --> 01:06:46.494
Claudine, Claudine,
Claudine, Claudine!

01:06:46.496 --> 01:06:48.494
- Who's wearing a schoolgirl's smock?
- Claudine!

01:06:48.496 --> 01:06:50.295
- Who's causing a hell of a shock?
- Claudine!

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:51.861
Who's working
all round the clock?

01:06:51.863 --> 01:06:56.394
Claudine, Claudine, Claudine, Claudine,
Claudine, Claudine, Claudine, Claudine!

01:06:56.396 --> 01:06:57.993
And when...

01:06:57.995 --> 01:06:59.527
in a dream...

01:06:59.529 --> 01:07:02.994
I find myself
next to Claudine

01:07:02.996 --> 01:07:05.160
and her magical eyes,

01:07:05.162 --> 01:07:07.129
forgetting
all other music...

01:07:08.063 --> 01:07:09.627
but the laughter
of her voice.

01:07:09.629 --> 01:07:11.160
Claudine!

01:07:11.162 --> 01:07:14.494
Claudine!

01:07:14.496 --> 01:07:16.197
Bravo.

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.961
Hello, Toby Chien.
Hello.

01:07:22.963 --> 01:07:24.460
Hello.

01:07:25.664 --> 01:07:27.495
I'm exhausted.

01:07:27.497 --> 01:07:29.461
Oh, me too.

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:31.263
More steps
every time.

01:07:31.996 --> 01:07:34.061
But what a night.

01:07:34.063 --> 01:07:37.230
We have Paris in the
palm of our hands.

01:07:39.995 --> 01:07:42.363
- Willy.
- Yes, my dear?

01:07:44.562 --> 01:07:46.463
I wondered
if tonight we might...

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:49.997
It would help me.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.331
Mmm.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:23.231
My love.

01:08:25.095 --> 01:08:27.430
My Claudine.

01:09:30.996 --> 01:09:32.897
Congratulations,
by the way.

01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:36.627
It seems Claudines
are everywhere these days.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:40.527
Yes. There's even been a Claudine
murderess in Marseilles.

01:09:40.529 --> 01:09:43.260
She slit
her husband's throat.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.527
Good for her.

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:51.193
But seriously, you've
done something important.

01:09:51.194 --> 01:09:53.527
You've invented
a type.

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:55.231
Willy has, you mean.

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:58.428
I mean you have.

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:02.864
All those young girls between girlhood and
womanhood, you've given them a voice.

01:10:03.664 --> 01:10:05.364
You should
own up to it.

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:08.127
Somebody told you?

01:10:08.129 --> 01:10:10.060
I didn't need
to be told.

01:10:10.062 --> 01:10:11.996
Meeting you is enough.

01:10:13.597 --> 01:10:15.197
It's true.

01:10:16.596 --> 01:10:18.129
I wrote them.

01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:21.130
It's just...

01:10:21.697 --> 01:10:23.331
I know.

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:31.228
<i>I hope the path we
walked today was merely the beginning.</i>

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:36.260
<i>I see your face, Missy...
strong, vulnerable.</i>

01:10:36.262 --> 01:10:38.330
<i>I've never met
anyone like you.</i>

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.560
<i>Polite yet direct.</i>

01:10:41.562 --> 01:10:43.264
<i>Reserved yet brave.</i>

01:10:44.062 --> 01:10:47.196
<i>A true gentle man.</i>

01:10:57.095 --> 01:10:59.060
Willy Gauthier-Villars'
residence.

01:11:01.563 --> 01:11:03.461
He's busy at the moment.

01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:05.594
- Can I take a message?
- It's the Soumaintrain.

01:11:05.596 --> 01:11:07.528
Reminds me
of Saint-Sauveur.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:09.561
Mmm. Oh, yes.

01:11:09.563 --> 01:11:11.961
It's delicious.

01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:14.064
- When do you go on tour?
- Mmm.

01:11:14.929 --> 01:11:16.260
A few weeks.

01:11:16.262 --> 01:11:18.661
Some real fleapits too.
It'll be hell.

01:11:18.663 --> 01:11:21.295
- Why do you do it?
- He might have some time on Thursday.

01:11:21.297 --> 01:11:25.528
I'm addicted. I love every
single dive and wastrel.

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:27.194
You should
come with us.

01:11:27.196 --> 01:11:29.627
- Can't do cantomime.
- This isn't cantomime.

01:11:29.629 --> 01:11:31.527
This is a new kind
of pantomime.

01:11:31.529 --> 01:11:34.394
- I'll put you down for a half an hour.
- Pure action.

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:37.128
The right gesture
is worth a thousand words.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.864
And how do you spell that?

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.560
Excuse me.

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:50.227
- Yes?
- Is Monsieur Willy at home?

01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:52.431
I was hoping
he could sign my book.

01:11:58.063 --> 01:11:59.929
Héon? Another one.

01:12:02.029 --> 01:12:04.261
This way,
please.

01:12:04.263 --> 01:12:06.327
Tell me
more about pantomime.

01:12:06.329 --> 01:12:09.928
Oh, well, it's something I've been
talking about with Christian.

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.927
Just an idea right now. We're
thinking of calling it <i>Flesh.</i>

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.364
Go on in.

01:12:17.963 --> 01:12:20.260
- Monsieur Willy.
- I am he.

01:12:20.262 --> 01:12:22.328
Hello.

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:25.863
Could you sign this?
It's my favorite book.

01:12:26.563 --> 01:12:28.897
Hmm. Thank you.

01:12:29.996 --> 01:12:31.560
To whom
should I inscribe it?

01:12:31.562 --> 01:12:33.264
My name is Meg.

01:12:35.397 --> 01:12:37.129
I am the real Claudine.

01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:44.461
- How old are you?
- I'm older than I look.

01:12:44.463 --> 01:12:45.464
I'm 23.

01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:49.930
Well, I'm younger
than I look. I'm 46.

01:12:50.695 --> 01:12:52.994
I don't mind.

01:12:55.529 --> 01:12:57.961
Whoa!

01:12:57.963 --> 01:12:59.431
- Right ahead!
- There it is!

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.528
- Come here, Toby.
- Toby, bring the ball.

01:13:15.696 --> 01:13:18.660
Can you bring it back? Go, Toby!

01:13:22.696 --> 01:13:24.430
Meg's very sweet,
isn't she?

01:13:26.628 --> 01:13:28.897
A little overeager,
but there you are.

01:13:29.663 --> 01:13:31.930
Reminds me of you
ten years ago.

01:13:32.696 --> 01:13:35.994
Nothing like.
But she is very sweet.

01:13:35.996 --> 01:13:38.060
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, come on!

01:13:38.062 --> 01:13:40.260
What do you think
of Missy?

01:13:40.262 --> 01:13:42.093
- Toby, come!
- She's very pleasant.

01:13:42.095 --> 01:13:44.263
But she perplexes me.
I'm...

01:13:46.462 --> 01:13:51.694
Words are either masculine or feminine, but
there's no... there's no word for Missy.

01:13:51.696 --> 01:13:54.331
Oh, I could think of
one or two.

01:13:56.297 --> 01:13:58.863
Well, you do seem content,
for once.

01:14:01.529 --> 01:14:03.997
Isn't there
something missing?

01:14:06.497 --> 01:14:07.997
What do you mean?

01:14:40.063 --> 01:14:42.593
Are you ready, Willy?

01:14:42.595 --> 01:14:44.996
Yes, I'm ready.

01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:50.263
My name is Claudine.

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:53.427
I live in Montigny.

01:14:53.429 --> 01:14:55.394
I was born there
in 1884.

01:14:55.396 --> 01:14:57.093
That's right.

01:14:57.095 --> 01:14:59.997
I shall probably not
die there.

01:15:02.063 --> 01:15:03.397
Forty-seven.

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:06.230
Forty-eight.

01:15:07.663 --> 01:15:09.494
Forty-nine.

01:15:09.496 --> 01:15:11.061
Come on.

01:15:11.063 --> 01:15:12.693
Fifty.

01:15:12.695 --> 01:15:15.896
Well done.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.927
You were married once, weren't you?

01:15:20.929 --> 01:15:23.394
Yes.
It was awful.

01:15:23.396 --> 01:15:26.993
We don't talk anymore, except
through the auspices of lawyers.

01:15:26.995 --> 01:15:29.128
He's embarrassed by me.

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:33.227
If he was married to me,
what does that say about him?

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.997
It must have been
very hard for you.

01:15:37.162 --> 01:15:39.127
- Putting on trousers, I mean.
- No.

01:15:39.129 --> 01:15:41.526
It was entirely natural.

01:15:41.528 --> 01:15:43.426
I was
a rather awkward child,

01:15:43.428 --> 01:15:47.227
if you can imagine me
in pigtails and a dress.

01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:49.361
I never felt like I belonged,

01:15:49.363 --> 01:15:54.393
and then one day I tried on my brother's
school uniform, and that was it.

01:15:54.395 --> 01:15:56.560
I knew I was home
for the first time.

01:15:56.562 --> 01:15:59.260
I've come a long way
since then.

01:15:59.262 --> 01:16:03.128
Of course, it's far easier for
me than for a woman of no means,

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:06.129
but I wanted to show
that it can be done.

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:09.160
What about you?

01:16:09.162 --> 01:16:12.660
- What about me?
- Well, I dress as a man.

01:16:12.662 --> 01:16:15.395
Willy dresses you
as a schoolgirl.

01:16:16.461 --> 01:16:18.129
Thank you.

01:16:19.628 --> 01:16:22.694
I do know what's going on, you know.
I'm in on the joke.

01:16:22.696 --> 01:16:25.231
I don't doubt it
for a second, but...

01:16:26.528 --> 01:16:28.263
but are you happy?

01:16:29.395 --> 01:16:30.996
Is anyone happy?

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:34.264
Willy is demanding, yes,
but...

01:16:35.296 --> 01:16:37.961
he also gives me
a lot of freedom.

01:16:37.963 --> 01:16:40.526
It is a long leash
he keeps you on,

01:16:40.528 --> 01:16:42.896
but it's a leash
nevertheless.

01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:46.197
And perhaps
you enjoy that.

01:16:47.996 --> 01:16:50.194
- Do you think that's terribly wrong?
- No.

01:16:50.196 --> 01:16:52.231
It's entirely
your business, but...

01:16:53.296 --> 01:16:54.462
Never mind.

01:16:56.297 --> 01:16:57.430
But what?

01:16:59.628 --> 01:17:03.129
I wonder if there
will come a time...

01:17:03.663 --> 01:17:05.526
when you must decide,

01:17:05.528 --> 01:17:08.329
are you Claudine
or are you Colette?

01:17:18.596 --> 01:17:20.930
- Hello, Héon.
- Hello, Colette.

01:17:22.062 --> 01:17:24.360
What kind of a mood
is he in?

01:17:24.362 --> 01:17:26.330
The usual, but worse.

01:17:29.963 --> 01:17:32.960
- Hello there.
- Oh, my word.

01:17:32.962 --> 01:17:35.493
- What are you wearing?
- They're Missy's.

01:17:35.495 --> 01:17:38.429
My dear, I'm surprised you
weren't arrested or beaten up.

01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:44.194
You know
the new Claudine book?

01:17:44.196 --> 01:17:45.427
Yes.

01:17:45.429 --> 01:17:48.430
Why don't we publish it
under both our names?

01:17:49.962 --> 01:17:52.327
That's out of the question.

01:17:52.329 --> 01:17:54.559
Ollendorff
would never agree to it.

01:17:54.561 --> 01:17:56.127
Ollendorff or you?

01:17:56.129 --> 01:18:00.994
Tetette, do you really want to kill the
goose that's laying the golden Claudines?

01:18:00.996 --> 01:18:03.027
There's very little risk,
surely.

01:18:03.029 --> 01:18:04.927
Claudine's established.

01:18:04.929 --> 01:18:08.259
And... most people know.
Or they suspect.

01:18:08.261 --> 01:18:09.459
Nobody knows.

01:18:09.461 --> 01:18:12.559
Unless you've been crowing about
it to your lady man friend.

01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:14.527
- Don't insult Missy.
- Oh, dear.

01:18:14.529 --> 01:18:17.061
She's stripping you of your sense of
humor as well as your common sense.

01:18:17.063 --> 01:18:19.394
- That's not fair, Willy.
- Look, we can't risk it.

01:18:19.396 --> 01:18:22.128
Especially not with our present finances.
We're completely broke.

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:25.559
We're always broke, and yet you gamble
and fill this place with your antiques.

01:18:25.561 --> 01:18:28.060
I bought those from bankrupts
from a debtors' auction.

01:18:28.062 --> 01:18:30.526
The car. The racehorse
that went lame.

01:18:30.528 --> 01:18:34.228
And you, with your funny clothes and your
hats and the exorbitant mortgage on...

01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:37.260
- I need my name on the book.
- No. Willy is a brand.

01:18:37.262 --> 01:18:40.994
- And, in any case, women writers don't sell.
- You bastard.

01:18:40.996 --> 01:18:44.128
You fat, smug, lazy,
selfish bastard.

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:48.526
This is utter nonsense. If you felt so strongly,
you should never have agreed to it all.

01:18:48.528 --> 01:18:50.061
Goddamn you, Willy.

01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:53.230
Without the progenitor,
there would be no Claudine.

01:19:34.995 --> 01:19:36.229
And prepare.

01:19:41.695 --> 01:19:43.660
Breathe.

01:19:43.662 --> 01:19:45.626
Remember
how the cat breathes.

01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:01.996
More animal.

01:20:14.396 --> 01:20:16.527
- Ready?
- Yes.

01:20:16.529 --> 01:20:18.263
Let's get to work.

01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:37.329
And...

01:20:39.529 --> 01:20:41.864
And...

01:20:46.195 --> 01:20:48.326
Are you going to write
today?

01:20:48.328 --> 01:20:49.929
No.

01:20:52.194 --> 01:20:54.229
Rehearsing with Wague
later.

01:20:55.696 --> 01:20:57.997
Well, don't you think
you ought to?

01:21:00.295 --> 01:21:02.660
I should start
locking you up again.

01:21:02.662 --> 01:21:04.896
I would scream
the house down.

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.896
Look, it's a charming
hobby, Tetette, but...

01:21:10.663 --> 01:21:13.226
you're not exactly
Sarah Bernhardt.

01:21:13.228 --> 01:21:14.794
So if you can't pull
it off as high art,

01:21:14.796 --> 01:21:18.359
you're gonna end up doing the bloody music
halls, and that would be scandalous.

01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:21.863
Since when have you considered
scandal to be a bad thing?

01:21:25.496 --> 01:21:27.030
That's true.

01:21:28.663 --> 01:21:30.060
What does Missy think?

01:21:30.062 --> 01:21:35.060
He's all for it. He comes along with
me to Wague's studio all the time.

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:37.393
God, how depressing.

01:21:37.395 --> 01:21:41.059
Does she have absolutely no
life of her own whatsoever?

01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:44.128
<i>He</i> does the movements with me.
He's rather good.

01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:49.193
Do you know, Wague thinks that I'll be
ready to go on the stage in a few weeks.

01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:51.694
What do you think, Matilde?

01:21:51.696 --> 01:21:55.160
I have to agree with Monsieur Willy, ma'am.
It's not very ladylike.

01:21:55.162 --> 01:21:57.330
Thought you were on my side.

01:21:59.529 --> 01:22:04.262
So you and the marquise prance around the
studio as potty, mimetic lovers, do you?

01:22:05.562 --> 01:22:07.928
Does Missy share your
ambition to go on the stage?

01:22:07.930 --> 01:22:10.129
No. He's far too shy.

01:22:11.462 --> 01:22:15.026
I've had an idea. It'll be
called <i>The Dream of Egypt.</i>

01:22:15.028 --> 01:22:17.192
Paris will never have
seen anything like it.

01:22:17.194 --> 01:22:22.863
A scandalous sensation starring Madame
Colette Willy and the Marquise de Belbeuf.

01:22:24.262 --> 01:22:26.259
In a common-or-garden
music hall.

01:22:26.261 --> 01:22:28.996
Can you imagine? It'll be
a full house every night.

01:22:30.029 --> 01:22:31.960
We do perfectly well
with the cancan.

01:22:31.962 --> 01:22:34.359
I've seen it half empty
on a weeknight.

01:22:34.361 --> 01:22:37.092
- You can vouch for the marquise?
- It's in the bag.

01:22:37.094 --> 01:22:39.928
We can even use the Belbeuf
family crest on the poster.

01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:43.527
- The press will go wild.
- Maybe so, Willy.

01:22:43.529 --> 01:22:46.493
- Do you have backers?
- Only need one.

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:47.929
Myself.

01:22:48.628 --> 01:22:50.993
You're that confident?

01:22:50.995 --> 01:22:53.263
- That's a lot of capital.
- Yes.

01:22:54.528 --> 01:22:55.929
Yes, I am.

01:23:00.663 --> 01:23:03.060
Meg.

01:23:03.062 --> 01:23:04.463
You look
beautiful.

01:23:06.995 --> 01:23:09.159
All of our friends
are here.

01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:10.626
Yes.

01:23:10.628 --> 01:23:14.996
Some of Missy's former husband's
friends are here too.

01:23:17.595 --> 01:23:19.393
Here.

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:20.995
Thank you.

01:23:30.562 --> 01:23:32.996
- Bravo!
- Boo!

01:25:16.995 --> 01:25:19.863
This is a disgrace!

01:25:25.261 --> 01:25:27.260
Bravo!

01:25:27.262 --> 01:25:29.559
Well done, Colette!
Well done!

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:37.059
Degenerate! Degenerate!

01:25:37.061 --> 01:25:40.092
What the hell do you think you're playing
at, you uncultured sack of shit?

01:25:40.094 --> 01:25:42.128
You're one of them,
aren't you?

01:25:58.129 --> 01:26:00.959
Madame Colette, what are your
impressions after tonight?

01:26:00.961 --> 01:26:03.527
My "impressions"?
I'm disgusted.

01:26:03.529 --> 01:26:05.593
The people who threw things
tonight are cowards,

01:26:05.595 --> 01:26:08.559
and the only reason I didn't get a footstool
in the face is because I dodged it.

01:26:08.561 --> 01:26:10.127
Let it go, Colette.

01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:12.260
There were some gentlemen
who came for a fight.

01:26:12.262 --> 01:26:14.227
We must ignore them
and go on.

01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:15.660
So you intend
to continue?

01:26:15.662 --> 01:26:17.193
- Yes!
- No!

01:26:17.195 --> 01:26:18.927
Those people don't
frighten me at all.

01:26:18.929 --> 01:26:20.459
Look.
Am I trembling?

01:26:20.461 --> 01:26:23.993
I will continue to pursue
this because I want to,

01:26:23.995 --> 01:26:25.992
and if Paris won't have
me, then so be it.

01:26:25.994 --> 01:26:28.028
I'll go elsewhere
to make a living.

01:27:18.696 --> 01:27:20.929
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:27:22.395 --> 01:27:26.127
Your father was an old soldier.
A good, solid man.

01:27:26.129 --> 01:27:27.396
He was.

01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:30.328
Was.

01:27:34.194 --> 01:27:35.429
I, um...

01:27:37.962 --> 01:27:40.494
I saw our creditors
yesterday.

01:27:40.496 --> 01:27:43.559
It's horrific. We lost
everything at the Moulin Rouge.

01:27:43.561 --> 01:27:45.429
- Not today, Willy.
- Colette.

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:50.359
We need to sell
the country house.

01:27:50.361 --> 01:27:51.594
- No.
- We have no choice.

01:27:51.596 --> 01:27:53.494
No.

01:27:53.496 --> 01:27:55.126
No, Willy.
You can't do that.

01:27:55.128 --> 01:27:57.160
Well, morally, yes,
I need your permission.

01:27:57.162 --> 01:28:01.929
But... legally,
well, the house is in my name.

01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:05.128
What do you think?

01:28:06.995 --> 01:28:09.660
You need to divorce
him, Gabri, and soon.

01:28:09.662 --> 01:28:10.826
Sido, please.

01:28:10.828 --> 01:28:15.259
You ask for a full audit of his accounts.
Willy is a mess.

01:28:15.261 --> 01:28:18.327
A drinker. A gambler. He's
a broken man, Gabrielle.

01:28:18.329 --> 01:28:19.863
Don't say that.

01:28:22.329 --> 01:28:24.330
He'll hold you back.

01:28:25.695 --> 01:28:29.330
Gabri, you have to
use your own gifts.

01:28:30.495 --> 01:28:32.326
You know, just...

01:28:32.328 --> 01:28:35.293
write something new
under your own name.

01:28:35.295 --> 01:28:36.462
Writing's a nightmare.

01:28:38.194 --> 01:28:41.192
All the hours I spent with
him breathing down my neck.

01:28:41.194 --> 01:28:43.427
The turn of the key in the lock.
The ache in my fingers.

01:28:43.429 --> 01:28:45.259
- I'm done with it.
- Oh, no, Gabrielle, just...

01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:49.294
I'm going on tour, Sido, with
Wague, for the next six months.

01:28:49.296 --> 01:28:52.060
The contracts are being drawn up now.
We're doing a new piece.

01:28:52.062 --> 01:28:54.259
- Get out of it. You have to.
- I'm going to do it.

01:28:54.261 --> 01:28:56.429
What did I miss?

01:28:59.596 --> 01:29:01.363
Women. Knives.

01:29:02.428 --> 01:29:03.996
All very Greek.

01:29:10.562 --> 01:29:12.326
Montmarault!

01:29:58.129 --> 01:30:01.259
Bravo!

01:30:01.261 --> 01:30:03.128
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

01:30:08.994 --> 01:30:11.229
Bravo!

01:30:18.627 --> 01:30:20.129
Tell me something.

01:30:21.362 --> 01:30:24.093
The sole rights to the
Claudines, Ollendorff.

01:30:24.095 --> 01:30:26.129
What would you give me
for them?

01:30:26.962 --> 01:30:29.896
Are you serious?
All of them?

01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:32.160
Yes.

01:30:32.162 --> 01:30:34.196
The sole rights
in perpetuity?

01:30:34.928 --> 01:30:37.195
Make me an offer.

01:30:49.928 --> 01:30:53.593
We had a cancellation in Limoges next
week, so I've got four days off.

01:30:53.595 --> 01:30:55.493
Will you be coming
back to Paris?

01:30:55.495 --> 01:30:57.193
No.

01:30:57.195 --> 01:30:59.996
I have to pack up the house
at Besançon.

01:31:02.361 --> 01:31:05.160
- Will he be there?
- Missy. I've had a long day.

01:31:05.162 --> 01:31:07.660
- Can we just...?
- Of course.

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:09.430
I'm sorry.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.559
You know...

01:31:15.561 --> 01:31:18.294
you don't have to worry
about Willy.

01:31:18.296 --> 01:31:21.896
You don't even need to earn your own
money or stay in places like this.

01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:24.592
I could arrange
everything.

01:31:24.594 --> 01:31:26.929
Too much of my life
has been arranged.

01:31:27.995 --> 01:31:31.128
And I like
earning my own money.

01:31:32.961 --> 01:31:35.128
I love you.
That's all.

01:31:36.628 --> 01:31:39.093
Thank you.

01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:42.129
That's not the traditional
response, but I'll take it.

01:31:43.262 --> 01:31:44.363
For now.

01:31:48.961 --> 01:31:52.492
You know, I've been thinking about
this new craze for moving pictures.

01:31:52.494 --> 01:31:55.492
Do you think we could adapt
Claudine for a cine-play?

01:31:55.494 --> 01:31:58.259
God, do you never stop?

01:31:58.261 --> 01:32:01.526
We could write a completely fresh story.
<i>Claudine by the Sea.</i>

01:32:01.528 --> 01:32:03.461
No. Adapt one
of the old ones.

01:32:05.694 --> 01:32:07.330
Perhaps.

01:32:13.262 --> 01:32:15.128
Catch.

01:32:16.261 --> 01:32:17.462
Oh, yes.

01:32:18.528 --> 01:32:20.063
How sad.

01:32:27.695 --> 01:32:29.659
I've missed you.

01:32:29.661 --> 01:32:32.128
- No, you haven't.
- Of course I have.

01:32:34.394 --> 01:32:38.558
Your ambiguous smile, your lightning
intelligence, your capricious joys.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.230
Even your brief
but violent furies.

01:32:42.128 --> 01:32:43.928
How's the book going
with Meg?

01:32:45.295 --> 01:32:46.895
Terribly.

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:50.062
All spice
and no literature.

01:32:51.662 --> 01:32:53.996
She's not you.
She never will be.

01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:57.129
What are we doing, Willy?

01:32:59.029 --> 01:33:00.329
Are we finished?

01:33:00.995 --> 01:33:03.129
I don't know.

01:33:05.261 --> 01:33:06.525
You can't.

01:33:06.527 --> 01:33:08.329
- Why can't I?
- Because I love you.

01:33:10.062 --> 01:33:12.660
Because you're the only
woman I could ever love.

01:33:12.662 --> 01:33:15.592
And because you're at your most
brilliant when you're with me.

01:33:15.594 --> 01:33:17.327
Am I?

01:33:17.329 --> 01:33:18.959
Yes.

01:33:18.961 --> 01:33:20.395
You know you are.

01:33:24.094 --> 01:33:26.229
You still need
your headmaster.

01:33:35.662 --> 01:33:38.129
Come in.

01:33:41.661 --> 01:33:43.328
May I get in with you,
Gabri?

01:33:44.662 --> 01:33:46.626
Yes.

01:33:46.628 --> 01:33:48.326
Get in.

01:33:48.328 --> 01:33:49.429
Can't sleep.

01:33:50.695 --> 01:33:52.660
Too quiet.

01:33:52.662 --> 01:33:53.996
Listen.

01:33:54.961 --> 01:33:57.128
Silence. It's
terrifying, isn't it?

01:33:57.994 --> 01:34:00.992
No. I love it.

01:34:00.994 --> 01:34:03.229
Of course you do,
country girl.

01:34:13.062 --> 01:34:14.926
Is everything
all right?

01:34:14.928 --> 01:34:17.493
There's something
weighing on my mind.

01:34:17.495 --> 01:34:18.929
What?

01:34:22.561 --> 01:34:25.325
I don't sleep with Meg
anymore.

01:34:25.327 --> 01:34:26.995
I mean, we sleep, but...

01:34:28.161 --> 01:34:29.230
I can't...

01:34:30.028 --> 01:34:31.995
Doesn't matter.

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:35.995
It does.

01:34:38.528 --> 01:34:40.329
Matters very much.

01:34:49.395 --> 01:34:51.192
Bravo!

01:34:51.194 --> 01:34:52.692
Bravo!

01:34:55.395 --> 01:34:58.395
- Colette, how was yours tonight?
- Not bad.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.525
- And are you going out after?
- Maybe.

01:35:01.527 --> 01:35:02.993
Madame Willy.

01:35:02.995 --> 01:35:05.996
- Ooh-la-la.
- Monsieur Ollendorff. Hello.

01:35:07.195 --> 01:35:09.625
I'm here in Lille
on some family business,

01:35:09.627 --> 01:35:12.626
and I was delighted when I found
out you were here with the play.

01:35:12.628 --> 01:35:15.959
- Oh. Well, it's very kind of you to come and see it.
- Quite a spectacle.

01:35:15.961 --> 01:35:21.027
I was thinking if you were free, I'd like
to take you and the marquise to dinner.

01:35:21.029 --> 01:35:23.526
Thank you. I'm always
up for a free feed.

01:35:23.528 --> 01:35:25.960
Especially
in such august company.

01:35:25.962 --> 01:35:28.993
Mmm, it's the very least
I can do for you, Colette,

01:35:28.995 --> 01:35:30.926
after all the money
you've made for me.

01:35:30.928 --> 01:35:33.092
And will continue to make.

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:36.059
I wish I'd been able to give
Willy a better settlement.

01:35:36.061 --> 01:35:39.259
But one can only pay
what one can afford.

01:35:39.261 --> 01:35:41.126
I'm not quite sure
I understand.

01:35:41.128 --> 01:35:44.462
For the Claudines.
The rights to the Claudines.

01:35:47.594 --> 01:35:49.293
Willy sold you
the Claudines?

01:35:49.295 --> 01:35:51.028
Yes. All of them.

01:35:52.094 --> 01:35:54.126
- He sold you the Claudines?
- Absolutely.

01:35:54.128 --> 01:35:56.127
I'm sorry.
I thought he...

01:35:56.129 --> 01:35:58.129
How much did he get
for them?

01:36:17.495 --> 01:36:21.059
I am most insulted by
the implication of your letter.

01:36:21.061 --> 01:36:23.693
We have transacted business
for five years...

01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:25.129
Tetette.

01:36:26.661 --> 01:36:28.895
I need to speak to you
alone.

01:36:31.961 --> 01:36:34.526
I'll see you later.

01:36:34.528 --> 01:36:36.329
Willy. Colette.

01:36:38.161 --> 01:36:41.158
- What is it?
- Five thousand francs.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.127
Don't be melodramatic. I was
trying to keep the house for you.

01:36:44.129 --> 01:36:46.526
- I gave you the house.
- We still owed the bank.

01:36:46.528 --> 01:36:50.393
You could have sold Veber's
novels, some of your other trash.

01:36:50.395 --> 01:36:53.258
You just did it to stick the knife in me.
Didn't you?

01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:55.326
Didn't you?

01:36:55.328 --> 01:36:58.258
I wouldn't have got anything for
Veber's, or Schwob's, or anyone else's.

01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:01.027
- Now, please, calm down.
- Why? Why should I calm down?

01:37:01.029 --> 01:37:05.258
Oh, you hurt and you hurt
and you hurt,

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.326
and you think that by saying
"I'm a man, that's what men do,"

01:37:08.328 --> 01:37:11.093
you clear it all away.

01:37:11.095 --> 01:37:15.026
What you did was not just
hateful, it was stupid.

01:37:15.028 --> 01:37:17.158
Now we'll have no say
over our books,

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.191
and we'll never make
another penny from them.

01:37:19.193 --> 01:37:21.225
- We can write some more.
- No, never. Never again. Never!

01:37:21.227 --> 01:37:24.126
You're overreacting. This was
purely a business decision.

01:37:24.128 --> 01:37:26.259
Isn't that what our whole
marriage has been?

01:37:26.261 --> 01:37:28.258
Wasn't I the best
investment you ever made?

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.458
No dowry, but my God, she
can write for her keep!

01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.993
If you were an investment, you
were a highly speculative one.

01:37:32.995 --> 01:37:35.425
I paid you back
a thousand times.

01:37:35.427 --> 01:37:37.927
Please, just stop it! Just
stop talking about money!

01:37:37.929 --> 01:37:40.593
You were my ideal,
my love, my obsession.

01:37:40.595 --> 01:37:42.896
You killed our child,
Willy.

01:37:44.395 --> 01:37:45.929
Those books...

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:49.063
they were all we had.

01:37:50.295 --> 01:37:53.128
And now they're gone and
there's no chance of repair.

01:37:55.361 --> 01:37:57.660
- My darling, Claudine was only...
- Don't.

01:37:57.662 --> 01:38:02.029
Don't tell me
what Claudine was.

01:38:03.394 --> 01:38:05.462
I am the real Claudine.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.459
Everything I thought and
felt went into those books.

01:38:11.461 --> 01:38:12.996
They were me.

01:38:13.995 --> 01:38:18.325
My childhood,
my memories, my opinions.

01:38:18.327 --> 01:38:20.425
Everything.

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:23.659
And when I think of
the hours I spent alone,

01:38:23.661 --> 01:38:26.993
slaving away for you,

01:38:26.995 --> 01:38:29.625
churning out scenes
just to try and please you,

01:38:29.627 --> 01:38:32.328
I am so ashamed of myself
for that.

01:38:34.094 --> 01:38:37.195
And yet I knew
and you knew...

01:38:38.194 --> 01:38:40.229
that I was bound
to do it.

01:38:42.994 --> 01:38:44.995
You found me
when I knew nothing.

01:38:46.261 --> 01:38:50.458
You molded me to your own
designs, to your desires.

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.428
And you thought that
I could never break free.

01:38:54.628 --> 01:38:56.128
Well, you're wrong.

01:38:57.361 --> 01:39:00.128
Claudine is dead now. She's gone.
You betrayed her.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.328
And I...

01:39:04.528 --> 01:39:06.328
I have outgrown her.

01:39:08.661 --> 01:39:10.429
Please.

01:39:12.395 --> 01:39:14.259
Please, I...

01:39:14.261 --> 01:39:16.258
I was so s...

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:18.428
I was stupid. I...

01:39:19.427 --> 01:39:21.393
I panicked. I...

01:39:21.395 --> 01:39:24.226
- Please forgive me.
- Good-bye, Willy.

01:39:24.228 --> 01:39:26.525
No, Gabrielle.
Gabrielle, please, no.

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:27.895
Gabrielle!

01:39:28.627 --> 01:39:30.329
My love, stop.

01:39:33.495 --> 01:39:35.195
I forbid you!

01:39:41.929 --> 01:39:43.429
That was my note.

01:39:44.993 --> 01:39:47.659
That's mine.
And that's mine.

01:39:47.661 --> 01:39:49.428
That's mine.

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:54.261
It was a collaboration.

01:39:56.361 --> 01:39:58.262
She really has a nerve.

01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:00.994
And these prove it.

01:40:04.627 --> 01:40:06.428
Would you do me a favor,
Héon?

01:40:08.161 --> 01:40:10.329
Will you destroy these,
please?

01:40:11.961 --> 01:40:13.692
- Are you sure?
- Definitely.

01:40:13.694 --> 01:40:15.626
Burn them.

01:40:15.628 --> 01:40:17.195
Incinerate them.

01:40:18.327 --> 01:40:19.395
All right, Willy.

01:40:21.961 --> 01:40:23.362
I'm going out.

01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:36.462
Shit.

01:42:07.061 --> 01:42:09.462
- Thirty minutes to curtain up.
- Thanks, Wague.

01:42:43.328 --> 01:42:46.426
<i>After two years
of music hall and theater,</i>

01:42:46.428 --> 01:42:48.593
<i>I'm still the same,</i>

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:50.626
<i>face to face
with that painted mentor</i>

01:42:50.628 --> 01:42:54.159
<i>who gazes at me from the other
side of the looking glass</i>

01:42:54.161 --> 01:42:58.229
<i>with deep-set eyes under lids
smeared with purplish greasepaint.</i>

01:42:59.228 --> 01:43:02.325
<i>I know she is
going to speak to me.</i>

01:43:02.327 --> 01:43:07.258
<i>She is going to say, "Is that you
there all alone under that ceiling,</i>

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.261
<i>booming and vibrating
under the feet of the dancers?</i>

01:43:11.528 --> 01:43:14.994
<i>Why are you there all alone?
And why not somewhere else?"</i>

01:43:16.627 --> 01:43:20.127
<i>Yes, this is
the dangerous, lucid hour.</i>

01:43:22.994 --> 01:43:25.992
<i>Now, whenever I despair,</i>

01:43:25.994 --> 01:43:28.526
<i>I no longer expect my end,</i>

01:43:28.528 --> 01:43:30.625
<i>but some bit of luck,</i>

01:43:30.627 --> 01:43:33.393
<i>some commonplace
little miracle which,</i>

01:43:33.395 --> 01:43:35.592
<i>like a glittering link,</i>

01:43:35.594 --> 01:43:39.092
<i>will mend again
the necklace of my days.</i>

01:43:39.094 --> 01:43:41.459
Colette!
Colette! Colette! Colette!

01:43:41.461 --> 01:43:46.229
Colette! Colette! Colette! Colette! Colette!
Colette! Colette! Colette! Colette!
