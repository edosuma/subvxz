00:28.693 --> 00:32.064
Come on, Hicks.

00:32.097 --> 00:36.235
This is for your
all-time best.

00:40.706 --> 00:42.642
Yay.

00:42.674 --> 00:46.611
I'm the champion,
the champion!

00:46.645 --> 00:48.214
Yes!

00:48.246 --> 00:49.269
Yes!

00:49.270 --> 00:51.483
I gotta call Margaret.

00:51.517 --> 00:53.286
Come on!

01:10.602 --> 01:11.870
Hey, hey, hey.

01:11.903 --> 01:13.206
What's going...
What's going on?

01:13.239 --> 01:14.640
The pressure's
through the roof.

01:14.673 --> 01:16.242
We've got
elevated methane.

01:17.376 --> 01:19.412
We've got to go down
and vent the pumps.

01:30.221 --> 01:31.524
-Give me a boost.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:35.561 --> 01:37.263
Yeow!

01:37.296 --> 01:38.331
Damn.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.365
You okay? You okay?

01:40.498 --> 01:41.867
Empty out the pipes.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.735
Turn off the lights!

01:43.769 --> 01:45.105
<i>The lights!</i>

01:50.808 --> 01:53.646
Damn,
we punctured the crust.

01:53.679 --> 01:55.347
We drilled way too deep!

01:55.381 --> 01:57.250
What is that?

01:57.283 --> 01:58.650
-What is that?
-Look out!

02:01.653 --> 02:03.221
God!

02:03.254 --> 02:06.224
Well, I'd say
I owe you one.

02:06.257 --> 02:07.626
We're going to have to
turn off the valve

02:07.659 --> 02:08.926
on the pressure
relief valve.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.362
Yeah.

02:10.395 --> 02:11.697
Come on!

02:18.804 --> 02:21.608
Holy crap!

02:37.389 --> 02:39.558
Come on, come on,
come on!

02:42.493 --> 02:43.429
Good.

02:43.461 --> 02:44.763
Move it, move it,
move it!

02:44.796 --> 02:45.764
Go!

02:49.935 --> 02:50.937
Come on, move it.

02:50.969 --> 02:52.337
Go! Go!

02:54.473 --> 02:56.409
No!

03:00.712 --> 03:02.715
Forget it, man.
Come on!

03:05.985 --> 03:07.320
Come on!

03:11.556 --> 03:13.692
Don't give up, buddy!

03:13.725 --> 03:15.627
Come on!

04:51.689 --> 04:53.459
<i>No word yet from the USGS,</i>

04:53.492 --> 04:54.927
<i>but we've had three calls
from Long Beach</i>

04:54.959 --> 04:55.995
<i>about a little shake tonight.</i>

04:56.028 --> 04:57.362
<i>Come on, kids.</i>

04:57.396 --> 04:59.398
<i>This is L.A.
Get used to it.</i>

04:59.430 --> 05:00.832
<i>Now back to your daily run</i>

05:00.865 --> 05:02.834
<i>of your favorite
L.A. music.</i>

05:25.990 --> 05:27.125
All right,
now look to your left.

05:27.158 --> 05:28.661
<i>My left or yours?</i>

05:28.694 --> 05:30.062
I don't know
which way you're facing!

05:30.095 --> 05:30.996
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

05:32.598 --> 05:34.467
<i>I don't see
any camping stuff.</i>

05:34.500 --> 05:36.769
It's, it's behind the box
marked Christmas.

05:36.802 --> 05:38.804
-There's Christmas stuff, behind it.
-Hello.

05:38.836 --> 05:41.940
Hey. I thought you weren't picking
her up until later this evening.

05:41.973 --> 05:44.476
I just wanted to see if she wanted
to hang out with the old man.

05:44.509 --> 05:45.644
<i>Mom, I don't see any...
Okay.</i>

05:45.677 --> 05:47.112
<i>-I found it.
-Okay, good.</i>

05:47.146 --> 05:48.646
<i>-What's she looking for?
-Heads up!</i>

05:48.680 --> 05:50.449
Wait! Going camping?

05:50.482 --> 05:53.052
<i>Me, with Cindy. Crap.
She's gonna be here any minute.</i>

05:53.084 --> 05:55.987
Hey, I thought
we had plans for tonight.

05:56.021 --> 05:58.591
Do you really think Pizza and
Redbox qualifies as plans?

05:58.624 --> 06:00.893
<i>Sorry, Dad. We'll do something
next week, okay?</i>

06:00.925 --> 06:02.394
No, no, it's not okay.

06:02.427 --> 06:03.596
You can't just, you know,

06:03.629 --> 06:05.097
cancel on someone
at the last minute.

06:05.129 --> 06:06.432
Really?

06:06.464 --> 06:07.866
Hey, just tell
Cindy's parents

06:07.899 --> 06:09.534
that you've made a commitment
and that we are...

06:09.567 --> 06:10.969
<i>Her parents aren't going!</i>

06:11.002 --> 06:12.137
<i>Ma, I can't find the tent.</i>

06:12.170 --> 06:14.639
Well, it's up there...
somewhere.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.975
Wait. Hang on a second. There's no
chaperone, did you know about this?

06:17.009 --> 06:19.645
What do you want her to do? Sit around and
pray that you don't stand her up again?

06:19.677 --> 06:21.713
She's got her own life,
you know.

06:21.747 --> 06:24.516
Yeah and I would appreciate not
being cut out of it completely.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.186
It's three days in a national park.
They'll be fine.

06:27.218 --> 06:29.154
Hey, you want to go camping?
Hey, that's great.

06:29.187 --> 06:30.555
You know,
I'm going to be up there.

06:30.588 --> 06:31.757
I'm breaking ground
at Station Five.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.559
You can hang out
with your old man.

06:33.591 --> 06:34.692
<i>Pass.</i>

06:34.726 --> 06:37.195
Look, it is dangerous up there
in the woods, you know.

06:37.228 --> 06:40.532
What would you do
if you ran into bears?

06:40.565 --> 06:42.133
<i>Never sleep in their beds,</i>

06:42.166 --> 06:44.502
<i>sit in their chairs,
or eat their porridge.</i>

06:44.536 --> 06:47.139
Look, I'm not
comfortable with this.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.741
Two girls alone
in the woods...

06:48.774 --> 06:50.942
<i>Derrick and his friends
will be there.</i>

06:50.975 --> 06:54.512
Hang on. There's boys?
That is worse than bears.

06:54.545 --> 06:55.647
You, you knew about this?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.981
Dad!

06:57.014 --> 06:58.550
You have to trust me.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.153
You know I can
take care of myself.

07:01.185 --> 07:03.788
Okay.

07:03.822 --> 07:04.956
Thanks, Dad.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.526
Just promise me...

07:08.560 --> 07:10.495
If you run into your grandmother
wearing a nightie,

07:10.528 --> 07:13.798
just double check...
Might be a wolf.

07:13.831 --> 07:14.966
Sure thing, Dad.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.101
Plus, grandma's way furrier,

07:17.134 --> 07:18.570
and she has thumbs!

07:20.572 --> 07:22.442
All right.
Do you have your checklist?

07:38.189 --> 07:40.225
Could be nothing.

07:40.259 --> 07:42.028
Probably nothing.

07:44.829 --> 07:45.865
Okay.

07:53.939 --> 07:56.775
And now it's something.

08:07.586 --> 08:09.855
Dr. Gladstone,
a delightful surprise.

08:09.887 --> 08:12.024
How many calls
have we had this morning?

08:12.057 --> 08:14.727
Just eight.

08:14.759 --> 08:16.661
No, I haven't seen
last night's seismographs.

08:16.694 --> 08:18.029
I haven't even had
a cup of cof...

08:18.062 --> 08:19.697
God!

08:19.730 --> 08:23.302
Doc,
it's my first day.

08:23.334 --> 08:25.169
Can't we just...

08:25.202 --> 08:27.005
The L.A. basin
always shows signs

08:27.038 --> 08:29.307
of deep crust activity
when...

08:29.341 --> 08:33.678
Intensifying aftershocks?
Pre-shocks?

08:33.711 --> 08:35.246
Don't you think
that's a little farfetched?

08:35.279 --> 08:37.315
Okay, I'll...
I'll look into it.

08:37.349 --> 08:39.083
Doc, I'll look into it.

08:39.116 --> 08:40.051
I promise.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.732
Drunk as could be.

08:54.765 --> 08:56.735
Looks the broad
right in the face and says,

08:56.768 --> 08:57.870
"If that's not a banana,

08:57.903 --> 08:59.904
What's it doing
in my cornflakes?"

09:01.606 --> 09:02.875
Who wants more champagne?

09:04.308 --> 09:05.810
We're out!

09:19.191 --> 09:21.726
Don't start without me!

09:25.163 --> 09:26.365
I've got the bubbles.

09:26.398 --> 09:28.801
Who's ready
for the...?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.240
<i>-Nice car.
-Thanks.</i>

09:36.274 --> 09:39.845
You,
you checked the fluids?

09:39.878 --> 09:41.146
Yep, changed the oil
this week.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.284
What about these? When's the
last time you had them rotated?

09:46.317 --> 09:48.252
I think
three months ago.

09:48.285 --> 09:49.988
You think,
or you know?

09:50.022 --> 09:50.890
I know.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.825
The receipts are in
the glove compartment.

09:55.092 --> 09:56.260
What's in the cooler?

09:56.293 --> 09:58.963
Just food and soda, sir.

09:58.996 --> 10:00.198
Better be!

10:02.868 --> 10:03.736
Hey.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.304
Damn, Nicki.
Your dad is way protective.

10:06.337 --> 10:09.073
Well, this weekend
he might have a reason to be.

10:10.942 --> 10:12.677
-What, what are you planning?
-Nothing!

10:12.711 --> 10:13.762
Mind your business.

10:13.763 --> 10:14.812
Is it something dangerous?

10:14.846 --> 10:16.932
My God!

10:16.933 --> 10:19.018
If, if it is, then we should
all be informed of it.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.152
Do you have firearms?

10:20.184 --> 10:21.819
-No.
-Of course not!

10:21.852 --> 10:23.855
Fireworks? They can be lethal...
Especially in the forest.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.658
You know, Southern California
has very dry summers.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.926
Shut it, Toblosky,
or we're leaving you behind.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.261
You better not be blabbing the
whole way or so help me, God,

10:30.294 --> 10:32.264
I will just dump your ass
in the middle of the desert,

10:32.297 --> 10:33.766
and I don't care
if you're paying for gas.

10:33.798 --> 10:35.167
-I'm not putting up with it.
-Okay, Warner.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.835
God!

10:36.868 --> 10:37.970
-Jeez!
-This is ridiculous!

10:38.003 --> 10:39.738
Your dad is a mammoth
pain in the ass.

10:39.770 --> 10:42.240
What is he like...
A Scottish Mountie or something?

10:42.274 --> 10:44.409
He's an engineer
for a fracking company.

10:44.442 --> 10:46.077
What the frack is fracking?

10:46.110 --> 10:48.146
It's actually very cool...
And very controversial.

10:48.179 --> 10:49.747
You know,
what they do is they...

10:49.780 --> 10:52.083
They drill like a mile down
into the earth's crust

10:52.116 --> 10:54.687
looking for, you know,
natural gases and oil.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.788
Then when they find it,
they drill sideways

10:56.822 --> 10:58.423
and let off
a series of explosions

10:58.456 --> 10:59.891
and finally
they force it out

10:59.924 --> 11:03.327
with millions of gallons
of pressurized water.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.297
What did I just say?

11:05.330 --> 11:06.732
Well, we're not driving!

11:06.764 --> 11:08.399
<i>Okay. Calm down.</i>

11:08.432 --> 11:10.068
Jeez, Warner.

11:12.971 --> 11:14.306
Ok, I think
we're ready to go.

11:14.339 --> 11:15.307
Awesome!

11:15.340 --> 11:17.776
Hey...
Okay.

11:17.808 --> 11:20.778
I will be right up there
if you want to see the rig...

11:20.812 --> 11:24.450
7 p.m.-that's when
we're turning all the pumps on.

11:24.482 --> 11:25.783
It's going to be
quite a sight.

11:25.817 --> 11:27.418
Yeah, we'll be sure
to stop by.

11:27.451 --> 11:29.053
Can we please go now?

11:29.086 --> 11:30.923
One last question...

11:30.956 --> 11:33.125
How many beers before
it's no longer safe to drive?

11:33.158 --> 11:35.060
Dad! Derrick,
don't answer that question.

11:35.092 --> 11:36.394
<i>Well, actually
it's the blood alcohol...</i>

11:36.427 --> 11:39.097
Hey, I'm asking him,
not you.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.365
Come on, tough guy.

11:40.398 --> 11:41.466
-Nothing.
-One beer.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.168
No.
Wrong!

11:43.201 --> 11:44.436
You're under 21.

11:44.469 --> 11:45.804
That's it, young lady.
Out of the car!

11:45.836 --> 11:47.272
Come on. No.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.707
Dad, stop it!

11:53.845 --> 11:55.413
All right. You just...

11:55.447 --> 11:59.083
You call me if there's
any problems, okay?

11:59.116 --> 12:00.284
No trouble, you hear?

12:00.317 --> 12:01.385
Yes, sir.

12:01.418 --> 12:02.954
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

12:02.988 --> 12:05.324
Bye.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.094
Sorry.

12:11.529 --> 12:12.964
Too possessive Jack.
You keep it up,

12:12.998 --> 12:15.100
you're going to
push her away even more.

12:15.133 --> 12:18.537
It's just the dysfunctional stuff.
Am I too involved or not enough?

12:18.570 --> 12:22.975
Being overprotective isn't
the same as being supportive.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.043
You've got to start
trusting her.

12:25.076 --> 12:27.946
What about that GPS tracking
app that you put in her cell?

12:27.979 --> 12:29.314
Yeah, but that's different.

12:29.346 --> 12:30.348
Really?

12:30.381 --> 12:32.116
Yeah.

12:32.149 --> 12:33.251
Hey, yeah.

12:33.284 --> 12:34.852
Hey, boss. Yeah.

12:34.885 --> 12:36.855
I'm I'm running
a little bit late.

12:36.888 --> 12:40.057
I've just got to pick up Hector
and I'll be on my way.

12:40.091 --> 12:41.793
Before you head there,
I need you to stop by

12:41.826 --> 12:43.261
Pump Station Three.

12:43.294 --> 12:44.529
We've got a little spike,

12:44.562 --> 12:46.298
<i>then the station went dead.</i>

12:46.331 --> 12:47.566
<i>We lost all our readings.</i>

12:47.599 --> 12:49.268
Come on, move it!
Let's go!

12:49.301 --> 12:50.502
<i>Come on, move it!</i>

12:50.534 --> 12:52.937
Okay, yeah,
wha-what about Paxton?

12:52.971 --> 12:54.405
<i>Yeah, I haven't heard back.</i>

12:54.438 --> 12:57.408
He pulled an all-nighter
so he's probably crashed out.

12:57.442 --> 12:59.010
<i>What is your problem?</i>

12:59.043 --> 13:01.245
Today, please!
Today!

13:01.278 --> 13:02.581
Yeah, and security?

13:02.614 --> 13:04.583
<i>That drunk is probably
passed out, too.</i>

13:04.615 --> 13:06.585
<i>He's as big of an idiot
as this moron</i>

13:06.618 --> 13:08.086
in front of me.

13:08.119 --> 13:09.288
Move it, toots!

13:10.621 --> 13:13.057
It's not like Paxton
not to check in, though.

13:13.091 --> 13:15.894
This is L.A., 55 means 70.

13:15.927 --> 13:17.329
Pick it up, Grandma!

13:19.230 --> 13:21.033
Ho, nice!

13:28.306 --> 13:30.375
Hey, Jack, I'll see you
this afternoon.

13:30.408 --> 13:31.610
It's a big day, man.

13:31.643 --> 13:34.046
I can't wait
'til we turn on...

13:34.078 --> 13:36.948
Would you
look at this guy?

13:36.981 --> 13:38.583
Stay in your lane, idiot!

13:40.585 --> 13:42.187
Listen, I've,
I've got to go.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.488
Sounds like it's going to be
one of those days.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.089
Sorry.

13:45.123 --> 13:50.028
Yeah, sorry to pile it on,
but could you just sign this

13:50.061 --> 13:52.398
and mail it in
whenever you can?

13:54.399 --> 13:55.900
Sure.

14:01.105 --> 14:02.206
Hello?

14:02.240 --> 14:04.876
Hi. I'm looking
for Dr. Booker.

14:04.909 --> 14:08.145
Could you, point me
in the right direction?

14:08.178 --> 14:10.348
Hello?

14:10.381 --> 14:13.251
Hello?
Mi-Miss?

14:13.284 --> 14:14.352
Hi there.

14:14.385 --> 14:15.353
Dr. Schiffman.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.222
Not Dr. Schiffman.

14:18.255 --> 14:20.424
Yes. It's the second time
I've been called doctor today.

14:20.457 --> 14:22.394
I'm not quite used to it.

14:22.427 --> 14:23.512
Emily's fine, sir.

14:23.513 --> 14:24.596
Michael.

14:24.629 --> 14:26.298
I will show you
around here.

14:26.331 --> 14:27.499
Am I early?

14:27.532 --> 14:29.100
What time does
everyone show up?

14:29.134 --> 14:31.637
I'm afraid this is it.
Budget cuts, you know?

14:31.669 --> 14:33.437
I'm actually a little surprised
they hired you,

14:33.471 --> 14:36.674
although I can use the company
and the help, especially today.

14:36.707 --> 14:39.144
This has been
a very funny morning.

14:39.177 --> 14:41.013
We've had 15 reports
since last night

14:41.046 --> 14:42.514
and I can't make
a lick of sense of it.

14:42.547 --> 14:44.582
So I've heard.

14:44.615 --> 14:45.616
Gladstone.

14:45.649 --> 14:47.084
Yeah.
I met him last year

14:47.118 --> 14:48.987
at a paleo-earthquake
seminar at Berkley

14:49.019 --> 14:51.155
and somehow I became
his new best friend.

14:51.188 --> 14:53.024
Yeah, that guy...
He's like a mutt...

14:53.057 --> 14:54.326
You pet him once,
he never leaves your lap.

14:54.359 --> 14:56.528
He heard my thesis
and he had to meet me!

14:56.561 --> 14:58.663
<i>Yes, I read that thesis.</i>

14:58.697 --> 15:00.365
It was on containment...

15:00.398 --> 15:01.500
-Epicenter.
-Yeah.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.032
Epicenter containment, yeah.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.468
-Yeah, it was quite...
-Ridiculous?

15:04.501 --> 15:05.569
No, I wasn't
going to say that.

15:05.602 --> 15:07.072
No, it's okay,

15:07.105 --> 15:08.507
my, my professors
thought the same thing.

15:08.539 --> 15:11.575
However, that ingenious theory
did earn me a strong C minus.

15:11.609 --> 15:14.480
And a job
at the glorious USGS.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.716
Yeah, you know,
you would think the state

15:18.750 --> 15:20.952
would make this place
more of a priority.

15:20.985 --> 15:23.322
Well, I do have a 24-hour
hotline to the governor

15:23.355 --> 15:24.389
anytime I need it.

15:24.422 --> 15:26.158
Really?
What's he like?

15:26.191 --> 15:28.560
I've never met him, so...

15:28.592 --> 15:32.496
Also, there is the sign-up sheet
for the company softball league.

15:32.529 --> 15:35.433
So far it's just me.

15:35.466 --> 15:37.269
I play first base.

15:37.302 --> 15:39.204
-Okay.
-Yeah.

15:39.236 --> 15:42.307
Here's the rules for using
the kitchen microwave,

15:42.340 --> 15:43.575
dah-dah, dah, dah.

15:43.607 --> 15:46.644
And over here
is your workstation.

15:46.677 --> 15:49.480
Now, we have been getting
calls all morning

15:49.514 --> 15:51.048
about tremor activity, okay?

15:51.081 --> 15:53.317
Nothing major,
no major damage...

15:53.350 --> 15:55.586
Just broken glass,
things flying off the shelves.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.489
The thing is,
the major scales...

15:57.522 --> 16:00.057
They haven't registered anything
above a semi passing by.

16:00.091 --> 16:01.360
Okay,
so what can I do?

16:01.393 --> 16:04.997
Well, we have 300 sensors
in the L.A. river basin.

16:05.029 --> 16:07.031
These reports are from
the last 12 hours.

16:07.065 --> 16:08.166
I'm gonna need you
to look through there,

16:08.198 --> 16:10.334
see if there's
any unusual peaks.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.437
Is this some sort of
new-guy hazing?

16:13.471 --> 16:15.240
Don't you have some intern

16:15.273 --> 16:19.110
or a computer
equipped to do this?

16:19.144 --> 16:21.679
We barely have enough money
for staples for this stapler.

16:23.514 --> 16:25.049
I shouldn't
have used that one.

16:25.082 --> 16:27.552
Sorry, kid.
Just you and me, honey.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.269
Dude!

17:31.316 --> 17:33.052
Dude?

17:37.721 --> 17:38.823
<i>Nate down in Palms.</i>

17:38.856 --> 17:40.692
<i>Callers told us a big sinkhole
just opened up</i>

17:40.724 --> 17:41.826
<i>right in the middle of
Robertson.</i>

17:41.859 --> 17:43.494
<i>Check this out, though.</i>

17:43.528 --> 17:45.163
<i>Got a call from a guy dining
across the street</i>

17:45.195 --> 17:46.363
<i>who says
he didn't feel a thing.</i>

17:46.396 --> 17:48.299
-That's the third one today.
-Yeah.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.601
<i>We've got
the Twiggies coming up next.</i>

17:49.634 --> 17:50.701
<i>So stick around.</i>

17:50.734 --> 17:51.869
Hey.

17:51.903 --> 17:53.771
You got your release
papers?

17:53.805 --> 17:56.141
What?
Give me that.

17:56.173 --> 17:58.876
The final nail
in the coffin.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.779
So,
so what's the plan?

18:01.813 --> 18:04.783
We hitting the strip clubs
or you surfing online?

18:04.816 --> 18:06.384
More women?
God, no.

18:06.416 --> 18:08.319
No, I've got my hands
full as it is anyway.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.721
The little one's
on your ass, too?

18:09.753 --> 18:12.490
Yeah, not so little anymore.

18:12.523 --> 18:13.557
Eighteen.

18:13.590 --> 18:16.193
Eighteen?

18:16.227 --> 18:18.396
So she's in that
get-away-from-me stage.

18:18.429 --> 18:19.230
Pretty much.

18:19.262 --> 18:21.332
"I hate you, Dad!
Get out of my room!"

18:21.365 --> 18:22.334
You know it.

18:22.366 --> 18:24.368
"I hope you die
so I could take my inheritance,

18:24.402 --> 18:27.405
move to Vegas
and start whoring on a strip."

18:30.708 --> 18:32.611
Went too far with that?

18:32.644 --> 18:33.644
What is wrong with you?

18:35.246 --> 18:37.182
Still, not too far
off the truth, you know?

18:37.214 --> 18:38.916
I remember when
I used to be a hero,

18:38.950 --> 18:42.386
and now I'm just this
annoying embarrassment.

18:42.420 --> 18:45.289
You know, women.
You can't live with them...

18:52.963 --> 18:55.799
Still, the lady
who's really busting my balls

18:55.833 --> 18:57.169
isn't Steph or Nicole.

18:57.201 --> 18:58.435
<i>I hear you, man.</i>

18:58.469 --> 19:00.372
This job is the worst bitch
I've ever known.

19:00.404 --> 19:02.206
Been my wife
for over two years now...

19:02.240 --> 19:05.410
Two long, miserable years
of ruthless spousal abuse, man.

19:05.442 --> 19:07.711
Look, look,
look at these bruises.

19:07.744 --> 19:12.650
Well, hopefully today this
marriage pays off for both of us.

19:12.683 --> 19:14.302
It better.

19:14.303 --> 19:15.921
It will.

19:15.953 --> 19:18.322
I have a very good feeling.

19:36.406 --> 19:39.443
<i>Next in line, fast!
Go, go.</i>

19:39.477 --> 19:41.947
<i>Spin around.</i>

19:41.980 --> 19:43.347
<i>Okay.</i>

20:12.009 --> 20:14.011
No, no, no, Gladstone.

20:14.045 --> 20:17.282
We don't have that information,
but we're trying.

20:17.315 --> 20:18.450
You don't even know
my mother!

20:18.482 --> 20:19.783
There are some
serious anomalies

20:19.817 --> 20:21.019
in the deep crust strata.

20:21.051 --> 20:22.721
Okay, hold on, hold on.
What did you find?

20:22.753 --> 20:24.321
Here.
At 2:17 this morning,

20:24.355 --> 20:27.025
a 2.1 with an epicenter
south of the city...

20:27.057 --> 20:28.259
That's just the beginning.

20:28.292 --> 20:29.827
Do you hear that, Marcus?

20:29.861 --> 20:30.862
What, no speakerphone?

20:30.894 --> 20:31.863
No money.

20:31.895 --> 20:34.566
2:41, 3:05, 3:56.

20:34.598 --> 20:36.533
They're escalating
on a graduating curve,

20:36.567 --> 20:38.002
radiating out
from the epicenter.

20:38.036 --> 20:41.006
The last one was 12 miles away
and twice the force.

20:43.374 --> 20:44.643
Marcus, how reliable
is this data?

20:44.675 --> 20:46.410
Well, we're going to need
everything,

20:46.443 --> 20:47.778
especially if we're doing
what you're suggesting.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.980
-What, what is...
-I'm sending Emily down there.

20:50.013 --> 20:51.649
Take her to the epicenter,
collect the data,

20:51.682 --> 20:53.350
compare it against
the Mercalli scale.

20:53.384 --> 20:54.653
But we're going to need
an eyewitness account

20:54.685 --> 20:56.887
if you expect me to pull
the trigger on this thing.

20:56.921 --> 20:58.355
What's he want you to do?

20:58.388 --> 20:59.824
Evacuate Los Angeles.

21:22.012 --> 21:23.814
Paxton!

21:23.847 --> 21:26.550
Hicks.
Yo, where you at?

21:26.584 --> 21:29.587
What is that, sulphur?

21:35.593 --> 21:37.329
Paxton, Hicks?

21:39.130 --> 21:40.732
Hey, Hector.
Check it out.

21:44.836 --> 21:45.871
That don't look good, Chief.

21:53.678 --> 21:56.081
Man, we are
bringing up all kinds of stuff

21:56.114 --> 21:58.583
that we shouldn't be
anywhere near drilling.

22:00.384 --> 22:02.921
Paxton, Hicks?

22:02.953 --> 22:04.489
Sure is humid down there.

22:04.521 --> 22:06.692
You know, humidity can
trigger an asthma attack.

22:08.492 --> 22:09.760
So?

22:09.794 --> 22:11.463
You don't have asthma.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.465
It does make my hair
really frizzy.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.066
You get down there!

22:15.098 --> 22:16.934
All right.
I'll check it out.

23:40.817 --> 23:41.952
That can't be right.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.530
Glorious morning to you.

23:53.564 --> 23:54.999
I'm sorry.
I have the wrong...

23:55.031 --> 23:56.166
You're here for Marcus.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.201
Come in. Come in.

23:57.234 --> 23:58.569
I'll take you to him.

24:01.571 --> 24:02.539
Can I get you an Evian?

24:02.573 --> 24:04.509
No. I'm fine.

24:04.541 --> 24:06.510
My husband's been
working away all night.

24:06.544 --> 24:08.947
He's in a heckuva tizzy.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.081
Who's your husband?

24:10.114 --> 24:11.583
Marcus.

24:12.549 --> 24:14.618
This makes no sense.

24:15.752 --> 24:17.855
Babycakes,
your visitor's here.

24:22.026 --> 24:24.729
Dr. Schiffman.
Thank heavens!

24:26.864 --> 24:27.999
This makes sense.

24:29.133 --> 24:30.969
Off to save the city.

24:31.001 --> 24:32.002
Will you be back for dinner?

24:32.036 --> 24:33.571
Don't know.

24:33.604 --> 24:35.640
<i>Well, stop and get
cupcakes on your way home.</i>

24:35.673 --> 24:36.708
Cupcakes?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.076
What's wrong with you, woman?

24:38.108 --> 24:40.144
I just said I'm off
to save Los Angeles.

24:40.176 --> 24:42.613
So, what?
Cheesecake?

24:43.914 --> 24:46.518
Yes, cheesecake.

24:51.154 --> 24:53.258
L.A., man...
55 means 70!

24:53.290 --> 24:54.925
Stupid foreigners!

24:54.959 --> 24:57.695
I don't think that Wisconsin's
a foreign territory.

24:57.728 --> 24:59.029
Yeah, well, who asked you?

24:59.063 --> 25:00.598
Racist and rude.

25:00.631 --> 25:03.134
Can't he just focus on
one blatant stereotype?

25:03.166 --> 25:05.503
I choose to be
unnecessarily violent.

25:06.304 --> 25:08.640
Stop it, Warner.

25:08.673 --> 25:09.540
What?

25:09.574 --> 25:10.575
You're such a jerk!

25:10.607 --> 25:13.176
I'm a jerk?
How?

25:13.210 --> 25:14.746
Bud, put on your seatbelt,
will you?

25:14.778 --> 25:17.615
I can't. I need easy access
to dork kid over there.

25:17.647 --> 25:19.149
You knew he was gonna
pick on the whole time.

25:19.182 --> 25:20.751
Why'd you even come?

25:20.785 --> 25:21.853
Entomology Club.

25:21.885 --> 25:23.654
The California National Forest
is crawling with, like,

25:23.688 --> 25:26.758
10,000 species in
the formicidae family.

25:26.790 --> 25:29.727
I'm just saying I'm a geek
who gets off on bugs, yuk-yuk.

25:31.061 --> 25:32.229
Leave him alone!

25:32.262 --> 25:33.330
Why you sticking up
for him?

25:33.364 --> 25:35.767
What, you got the hots
for this tool?

25:35.799 --> 25:37.568
No!

25:37.602 --> 25:39.738
She's has her eyes
on somebody else.

25:41.238 --> 25:43.141
Well, call me flattered.

25:43.173 --> 25:44.308
Shut up, Warner!

25:44.342 --> 25:45.843
Hey, easy.
Not in the car.

25:45.875 --> 25:46.978
I'm driving.

26:03.827 --> 26:05.696
They better not
jump out and scare us.

26:07.163 --> 26:08.666
I've got a weak heart.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.103
<i>Paxton!</i>

26:19.309 --> 26:21.846
This is Paxton's phone.

26:21.878 --> 26:25.082
There's something
not right here.

26:29.753 --> 26:30.888
Who's the idiot...

26:34.224 --> 26:36.059
<i>Is that...</i>

26:36.093 --> 26:38.096
Is that...

26:38.128 --> 26:39.096
Yeah, that's...

26:49.105 --> 26:51.076
Go, go, go, go, go!

26:53.443 --> 26:55.046
Go, come on.
Get up!

27:06.457 --> 27:08.159
I can't move it, Chief.

27:08.192 --> 27:09.760
That's the only way
out of here

27:09.794 --> 27:11.396
because this tunnel's
collapsed.

27:11.429 --> 27:12.697
Help!

27:12.730 --> 27:14.399
Anyone, we're
trapped down here!

27:14.432 --> 27:19.303
Hey, conserve...
Conserve your oxygen.

27:19.336 --> 27:20.938
There's no one out there.

27:20.971 --> 27:22.306
The only people
who worked here

27:22.338 --> 27:24.808
are buried under
50 tons of concrete.

27:24.842 --> 27:26.009
Hail Mary,
full of grace.

27:26.042 --> 27:26.710
The Lord is with thee.

27:26.743 --> 27:28.311
Blessed art thou
amongst women.

27:28.345 --> 27:29.647
Blessed is...

27:29.648 --> 27:30.948
That's a great prayer.

27:30.980 --> 27:34.352
That's a great way
to conserve oxygen.

27:35.452 --> 27:37.055
What the...

27:37.087 --> 27:42.292
You guys really screwed
the pooch, didn't you?

27:45.796 --> 27:47.164
That's weird.

28:08.018 --> 28:10.188
Is your sleeping bag
up there?

28:10.221 --> 28:12.155
What about it?

28:12.189 --> 28:14.392
I don't know. The material
looks a little thin.

28:14.424 --> 28:15.960
It could get cold inside.

28:17.528 --> 28:18.895
You think so?

28:19.997 --> 28:23.935
I, might know a way
to make it a little warmer.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.441
Guess that's settled.

28:31.474 --> 28:34.144
Looks like we're
hooking up this weekend.

28:34.178 --> 28:36.247
So...

28:36.279 --> 28:38.014
It's possible,

28:38.048 --> 28:39.416
but I think there's
a better chance

28:39.450 --> 28:41.086
of you getting
your face smashed in.

28:43.386 --> 28:45.322
But can't we do both?

28:49.292 --> 28:50.360
Teddy, let's go!

28:52.395 --> 28:54.798
Come on, dude. I want to stop
and get something to eat.

29:14.018 --> 29:16.453
All these small earthquakes,
that was you.

29:16.487 --> 29:17.872
You fractured a fault.

29:17.873 --> 29:19.257
You know what?

29:19.289 --> 29:21.424
We have followed regulation
to the letter.

29:21.458 --> 29:22.994
Who the hell
are you guys anyway?

29:23.027 --> 29:24.028
USGS.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.428
Uggs?

29:25.461 --> 29:27.330
Them boots
Tom Brady wears?

29:27.364 --> 29:29.534
United States
Geological Survey.

29:29.567 --> 29:32.870
Look, there's not been
one recorded seismic incident

29:32.903 --> 29:34.572
convincingly
linked to fracking.

29:34.605 --> 29:35.906
The only thing
that's going on here

29:35.940 --> 29:37.909
is an outflow valve
malfunction...

29:41.278 --> 29:42.480
Most likely.

29:42.512 --> 29:44.182
All this is from today.

29:46.517 --> 29:48.820
Starting here... here.

29:51.521 --> 29:54.558
And following these lines
radiating around

29:54.592 --> 29:57.295
from this point here
and here, flowing out.

29:57.327 --> 29:58.562
It's epicenter dispersal.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.431
In the worst
possible way.

30:00.463 --> 30:02.866
You see, the entire
Los Angeles basin

30:02.900 --> 30:04.969
is a network
of deep faults...

30:05.001 --> 30:06.537
The San Andreas system.

30:06.569 --> 30:07.571
Ever heard of it?

30:07.605 --> 30:08.972
This data suggests
the fluids

30:09.006 --> 30:10.341
being forced at
high pressure

30:10.374 --> 30:13.376
underneath this station
produced these microfissures

30:13.410 --> 30:16.247
which reach all the way down
to the primary fault lines.

30:16.279 --> 30:17.882
Causing this ripple effect.

30:17.914 --> 30:20.017
And now all these new
cracks are popping up

30:20.049 --> 30:22.019
all along the deeper
fault lines

30:22.051 --> 30:24.554
which makes the entire
L.A. basin unstable.

30:24.587 --> 30:26.190
-What?
-What do you mean, unstable?

30:26.222 --> 30:28.459
You're predicting
a massive earthquake?

30:28.491 --> 30:30.228
At first,
the city will suffer

30:30.260 --> 30:34.264
hundreds of highly localized
mini earthquakes.

30:34.298 --> 30:36.467
The scope of impact
can range from the size

30:36.500 --> 30:38.970
of a small house
to an entire city block.

30:39.002 --> 30:40.937
Unless you were standing
right on top of a fissure,

30:40.971 --> 30:42.205
you probably
wouldn't even know it.

30:42.239 --> 30:44.408
And when enough of these
microfissures branch out

30:44.441 --> 30:48.078
and cut back to their original
primary fault lines...

30:48.112 --> 30:50.413
What?

30:50.446 --> 30:52.215
The basin will collapse.

30:52.249 --> 30:53.517
That, that is ridiculous!

30:53.549 --> 30:56.586
Can I borrow this?

30:56.619 --> 30:57.621
Marcus?

30:57.654 --> 30:59.456
This is going to be great.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.858
Hey, what are you...

31:01.925 --> 31:03.293
Hey, what's wrong with you?

31:03.326 --> 31:06.663
You see, when these
microfissures come together,

31:06.696 --> 31:12.936
the upper strata
gets weaker and weaker until...

31:12.970 --> 31:15.006
The L.A. basin caves in.

31:15.038 --> 31:17.340
It's a virtual 10.0.

31:17.374 --> 31:18.608
The big one!

31:18.642 --> 31:20.077
<i>Dios mio!</i>

31:31.087 --> 31:33.523
Well, I'm going to jump
at the opportunity

31:33.557 --> 31:36.259
to use indoor plumbing
for the last time this weekend.

31:36.292 --> 31:37.394
Excuse me.

31:43.032 --> 31:45.468
I like your shirt, Derrick.

31:45.501 --> 31:48.204
Looks soft.
Is it cotton?

31:48.238 --> 31:51.409
Probably
a cotton/polyester blend.

31:51.442 --> 31:53.576
Ahem.

31:53.609 --> 31:55.712
Hey, check this out.
This is interesting.

31:55.746 --> 31:57.448
Redwood ants
have chemo receptors

31:57.480 --> 31:59.016
for carbon dioxide gradients

31:59.048 --> 32:01.719
and magnetic receptors
for electromagnetic fields.

32:03.287 --> 32:06.156
Okay, researchers found
that before an earthquake,

32:06.190 --> 32:08.259
ants stay awake
all throughout the night,

32:08.291 --> 32:11.528
outside their mound,
vulnerable to predators,

32:11.561 --> 32:13.029
and they'll stay that way,

32:13.063 --> 32:16.167
doing nothing until a day
after the quake.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.302
I think that's what
these guys are doing.

32:18.335 --> 32:19.737
You're saying
ants can sense

32:19.769 --> 32:21.439
when an earthquake
is about to strike?

32:21.471 --> 32:25.509
Well, the University
Duisberg-Essen in Germany is.

32:25.541 --> 32:26.576
I think they're right.

32:26.609 --> 32:28.144
It's a big one.

32:28.178 --> 32:30.147
Stop that!
You're going to...

32:30.180 --> 32:31.315
Put it down,
put it down.

32:31.347 --> 32:32.383
Stop that!

32:34.617 --> 32:36.653
I've got to
take a leak, too.

32:36.686 --> 32:39.122
Teddy, take care of that,
all right?

32:39.155 --> 32:40.191
Yeah.

32:50.666 --> 32:51.769
What are you doing in here?

32:51.801 --> 32:54.004
What do you think?

32:54.038 --> 32:56.274
I don't know.

33:07.050 --> 33:09.352
Okay. Just slow down.

33:09.385 --> 33:10.687
Maybe not in here.

33:10.721 --> 33:12.323
What's your problem?

33:12.355 --> 33:13.423
We're in a bathroom.

33:13.457 --> 33:15.760
Aw, come on. You know you
want it just as bad as I do.

33:15.792 --> 33:18.395
No, Derrick.
Let's go back out there.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.230
What, if you want
some privacy,

33:20.263 --> 33:22.065
-we can just go in a stall.
-No, I don't want privacy.

33:22.098 --> 33:23.333
I don't want privacy, Derrick.

33:23.366 --> 33:24.367
Stop!

33:25.701 --> 33:26.804
Let me out.
Let me out!

33:26.836 --> 33:29.773
Stop being such a prude.

33:29.807 --> 33:31.075
Okay.

33:35.112 --> 33:36.581
I said stop, Derrick!

33:52.563 --> 33:54.132
I guess the ants were right.

33:57.867 --> 33:59.669
Look, unless
you've got a subpoena,

33:59.702 --> 34:01.704
I can't show you
the operating logs.

34:01.738 --> 34:02.740
Look, I'm just the engineer.

34:02.772 --> 34:04.240
I don't have the authority.

34:04.273 --> 34:06.476
This is the owner's
direct number.

34:06.509 --> 34:08.579
I'm sure he'll be happy
to cooperate.

34:08.612 --> 34:10.681
Yes,
that'll happen.

34:10.713 --> 34:13.683
Here is my number.

34:13.717 --> 34:17.221
Call me
if you need anything.

34:17.253 --> 34:18.855
I'm just really sorry
about your people.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.623
Thanks.

34:20.657 --> 34:23.094
If there's anything you think
we should do on our side...

34:23.126 --> 34:24.393
Well, if I were you,
I'd hire a lawyer

34:24.427 --> 34:26.130
and prepare
for 20 years in prison.

34:26.163 --> 34:28.331
Of course, you might luck out
and die in the earthquake.

34:28.364 --> 34:31.568
Sorry. Hope the rest
of your day goes better.

34:35.271 --> 34:37.540
You think they're right
that we caused this?

34:37.574 --> 34:38.543
I don't know.

34:40.344 --> 34:41.478
Maybe.

34:42.746 --> 34:43.746
Come on,
damn it.

34:43.780 --> 34:44.748
Why don't you answer?

34:44.780 --> 34:46.317
Nicole?

34:46.349 --> 34:48.318
Yeah.
She and her friends...

34:48.351 --> 34:50.887
They're headed
straight for the...

34:50.920 --> 34:53.389
Hey. Yeah,
listen, it's me.

34:53.422 --> 34:56.793
Listen,
are you sitting down?

34:56.827 --> 34:59.597
Paxton and Hicks are dead.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.233
The access tunnel collapsed,
and guess who I just had

35:02.266 --> 35:04.902
a very long and frightening
conversation with?

35:04.934 --> 35:07.137
Yeah, the f'ing USGS.

35:07.170 --> 35:08.505
Jack, listen to me.

35:08.539 --> 35:12.376
They're just looking
for someone to blame, okay.

35:12.409 --> 35:14.512
Calm down, calm down.
Listen to me.

35:14.545 --> 35:17.280
Once we go live,
we'll scale back for a few days.

35:17.313 --> 35:18.882
Everything will be cool.
All right?

35:18.916 --> 35:20.251
But these aren't regulators.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.652
These are scientists
who are sure

35:21.684 --> 35:24.221
that we are responsible
for every single sinkhole

35:24.253 --> 35:25.589
that is happening
across the city.

35:26.822 --> 35:27.790
Well,
Hold on, hold on.

35:27.824 --> 35:28.858
Slow your horses.

35:28.891 --> 35:30.627
What's going on?

35:30.661 --> 35:31.695
Earthquakes?

35:35.666 --> 35:36.800
You follow protocol, right?

35:36.833 --> 35:38.335
I mean, my schematics to a T,

35:38.367 --> 35:41.505
because if I find out
that you drilled too deep...

35:42.639 --> 35:45.342
We are not opening
Station Five tonight.

35:45.375 --> 35:48.344
Why? Because we have
two employees

35:48.378 --> 35:50.314
who died a heluva gruesome...

35:51.315 --> 35:53.317
This,
this is a PR nightmare.

35:55.552 --> 35:57.820
And if you want to
escalate the problem...

35:57.853 --> 36:01.224
Look, Ritter,
my daughter is up there.

36:01.257 --> 36:02.525
Now just promise me

36:02.559 --> 36:04.528
that you will shut down
every single station

36:04.561 --> 36:06.664
until we can find out
exactly what went wrong.

36:06.697 --> 36:07.898
You have my word.

36:07.931 --> 36:09.532
Just take care
of your family,

36:09.565 --> 36:13.403
and I'll take care
of things up here, okay?

36:13.436 --> 36:14.505
Later.

36:14.538 --> 36:15.972
God damn it!

36:16.005 --> 36:18.442
Hey Hector,
call your family.

36:18.474 --> 36:20.677
Send them south.
Then head to five,

36:20.710 --> 36:22.278
make sure Ritter doesn't do
anything stupid.

36:22.311 --> 36:23.547
-I don't trust that guy.
-Who does?

36:23.579 --> 36:24.715
What about the bodies?

36:24.748 --> 36:26.817
I'll call the police
on the way.

36:26.849 --> 36:30.520
I'm going to get my family, and I'll
meet you up there as soon as possible.

36:50.574 --> 36:52.576
<i>First of all,
it's the zone...</i>

36:52.608 --> 36:53.710
<i>The Alquist Priolo zone</i>

36:53.744 --> 36:55.046
<i>which as Dr. Parrish mentioned,</i>

36:55.079 --> 36:58.015
<i>has the greatest potential
for surface fault rupture</i>

36:58.047 --> 37:01.317
<i>which is much more likely
to cause damage</i>

37:01.351 --> 37:03.320
<i>and, and death and injury.</i>

37:03.353 --> 37:04.688
<i>It's limited to an area</i>

37:04.721 --> 37:06.456
<i>around the base
of the Hollywood Hills.</i>

37:06.489 --> 37:08.491
<i>Much of Hollywood
is not affected by this map.</i>

37:10.860 --> 37:12.862
Earthquake?

37:12.896 --> 37:14.932
It's an earthquake.

37:14.965 --> 37:15.966
My God!

37:15.998 --> 37:17.533
My God!

37:17.567 --> 37:18.501
<i>Help!</i>

37:32.014 --> 37:33.817
-Steph!
-Jack!

37:35.552 --> 37:37.054
Where's your phone?
Where's your phone?

37:37.086 --> 37:38.889
In the kitchen,
in the kitchen.

37:38.922 --> 37:40.023
God!

37:40.056 --> 37:41.358
What are you doing?
Come on.

37:55.005 --> 37:56.039
Come on! Let's go!

37:56.072 --> 37:57.407
-What?
-Let's go!

38:06.750 --> 38:08.485
My God!

38:08.518 --> 38:09.887
Okay, all right.
Come on. Let's go!

38:09.920 --> 38:11.989
Go? Go where?
What do you mean?

38:12.021 --> 38:13.790
We have to find
our daughter. Come on.

38:13.824 --> 38:14.791
God!

38:35.378 --> 38:36.880
Be aware of wolves.

38:36.913 --> 38:38.782
-You say something?
-No.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.952
Guys, maybe, maybe
we should just go back.

38:42.985 --> 38:44.087
What?

38:44.121 --> 38:46.789
Why? Because of
that little tremble?

38:46.822 --> 38:49.525
Those aftershocks are
happening all over the place.

38:49.559 --> 38:51.428
Everybody's Twitter
on Twitter.

38:51.460 --> 38:52.829
That's funny.

38:52.862 --> 38:54.130
What is?

38:54.164 --> 38:56.967
Your Twit...
Never mind.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.835
Look, I think Nicole's right.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.038
I was reading about these
really intense sinkholes

39:01.070 --> 39:03.873
before I ran out of juice.

39:03.907 --> 39:06.110
By the way, can I,
can I use your phone charger?

39:06.143 --> 39:09.112
No, I'm using it
and we're not turning around.

39:09.146 --> 39:10.381
You guys are worried
about sinkholes.

39:10.414 --> 39:11.615
Seriously?

39:11.648 --> 39:13.717
Yeah, come on.
We're already here anyway.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.353
Woo-hoo!

39:44.880 --> 39:45.982
What's the matter, boy?

40:07.003 --> 40:08.672
Relax, relax.

40:20.115 --> 40:21.751
I felt that, too.

40:56.987 --> 40:58.722
That can't be right.

41:00.155 --> 41:01.858
It's right here.

41:17.139 --> 41:18.674
Hey, hey, hey, baby.

41:18.708 --> 41:19.910
I just want to tell you
that I love you

41:19.943 --> 41:21.745
and you mean
absolutely the world to me

41:21.777 --> 41:26.115
and I just wanted you to know
that time in Cabo

41:26.148 --> 41:28.085
when you were
passed out, yes,

41:28.117 --> 41:30.686
I-I did hook up with the concierge,
but it didn't mean anything.

41:30.719 --> 41:33.523
If you can just find it
in your heart to just for...

41:37.760 --> 41:40.630
Hey, baby, if you could just
disregard that message.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.299
I'll see you
when you get home.

41:42.331 --> 41:43.800
Love you, Dennis.

41:52.641 --> 41:55.011
That was close.

42:00.817 --> 42:02.184
He's still
not answering.

42:02.217 --> 42:03.553
Well, then
try someone else.

42:03.586 --> 42:05.688
There must be 100 bureaucrats
at the USGS

42:05.722 --> 42:06.957
who'll take your call.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.894
I bet he's just buried
in paperwork.

42:11.927 --> 42:13.696
If the evacuation
doesn't begin soon,

42:13.730 --> 42:15.798
the consequences
will be catastrophic.

42:15.831 --> 42:18.268
There must be someone
in authority we can call.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.570
I don't know who.
It's, it's my first day,

42:20.603 --> 42:22.906
and they sure as heck
won't listen to me.

42:34.317 --> 42:35.652
<i>What?</i>

42:35.684 --> 42:37.119
What do you mean,
it's your fault?

42:37.152 --> 42:39.956
Look, it might be.

42:39.989 --> 42:41.791
Look, the tremors might...

42:41.824 --> 42:45.161
might have been caused by
one of our fracking stations.

42:45.195 --> 42:48.265
Jack, this is
so like you.

42:48.297 --> 42:49.765
Yeah, that's right.

42:49.798 --> 42:51.233
So like me because
I've got a long history

42:51.266 --> 42:52.935
of starting earthquakes.

42:52.969 --> 42:54.704
Let's see, now, Northridge,
yeah, that was me.

42:54.737 --> 42:56.138
Philippines, yeah,
that was me again.

42:56.172 --> 42:57.673
You know,
you put our family last

42:57.706 --> 42:59.141
and that's pretty much
the same.

42:59.175 --> 43:00.611
-Yeah.
-That is...

43:00.643 --> 43:02.912
You know, that is
unbelievable because...

43:02.945 --> 43:04.114
Ok, hang on...

43:04.146 --> 43:05.849
<i>-What?
-I think I found her.</i>

43:07.416 --> 43:08.652
What is it?
You found Nicole?

43:08.684 --> 43:09.820
Send her a text

43:09.853 --> 43:11.688
and just keep an eye
on where she is.

43:11.721 --> 43:12.956
Come on, move it, people.

43:12.989 --> 43:15.057
Come on, Nicole.
Just show us where you are.

43:15.090 --> 43:16.926
Just let us know
you're okay.

43:27.269 --> 43:28.972
Guys...

43:29.005 --> 43:30.340
guys, we need
to go back, like, now.

43:30.373 --> 43:31.907
What? Why?

43:31.940 --> 43:33.143
I'm serious.
We're in real danger here.

43:33.175 --> 43:34.378
All right, here we go.

43:34.411 --> 43:35.378
Why, what did you read?

43:35.411 --> 43:36.980
Seriously, Nicole.

43:37.012 --> 43:37.713
I'm tired of it.

43:37.746 --> 43:40.250
Stop being
such a bitch, okay?

43:40.282 --> 43:41.317
This isn't your truck

43:41.351 --> 43:42.385
and you're not...

43:42.418 --> 43:44.020
Jesus!

43:50.793 --> 43:51.795
<i>She stopped moving.</i>

43:51.827 --> 43:53.030
God,
she stopped moving!

43:53.063 --> 43:54.131
That's good.

43:54.164 --> 43:56.233
It means she set up camp.

43:56.266 --> 43:57.934
Okay, so it's a good thing.

43:57.967 --> 43:59.202
All right.

43:59.235 --> 44:00.303
<i>Okay.</i>

44:00.335 --> 44:01.804
God!

44:01.838 --> 44:03.273
-Well...
-Where are you going?

44:03.306 --> 44:04.942
-What are you doing?
-Taking a shortcut.

44:11.715 --> 44:13.817
<i>Taking a shortcut
to the Ronald Reagan.</i>

44:13.849 --> 44:15.251
There'll be a little bit
more traffic on the five,

44:15.284 --> 44:18.020
but after that it should be
smooth sailing until the forest.

44:18.054 --> 44:19.155
Let's hope so.

44:19.188 --> 44:20.456
Don't worry.

44:20.489 --> 44:22.792
The worst is behind us.

44:29.231 --> 44:31.233
Dr. Booker!

44:31.266 --> 44:34.036
Dr. Booker!

44:34.070 --> 44:35.739
Michael!

44:35.771 --> 44:37.240
Help me get this
off of him!

44:42.911 --> 44:44.213
There's no point in
digging him out.

44:44.246 --> 44:45.315
We need to get going.

44:45.347 --> 44:46.449
We can't just leave him.

44:46.483 --> 44:48.018
<i>Yes, we can.</i>

44:48.050 --> 44:50.152
If you want to fish him out
and take him with us,

44:50.186 --> 44:51.321
I call shotgun.

44:51.353 --> 44:52.989
How could you be so callous?

44:53.021 --> 44:55.759
Years of practice.

44:55.791 --> 44:57.293
Fudge nuggets!

44:57.327 --> 44:58.995
What? How bad is it?

44:59.027 --> 45:02.498
Horrible for everyone
in Los Angeles except you.

45:02.532 --> 45:03.800
Why not me?

45:03.833 --> 45:05.402
You just got a promotion.

45:05.434 --> 45:06.769
Let's go!

45:12.007 --> 45:13.743
Do you think she's okay?

45:13.777 --> 45:15.177
Yeah, don't worry.

45:15.210 --> 45:18.347
You know, the cell service
is one of the first things

45:18.380 --> 45:20.149
to always go down.

45:20.182 --> 45:21.418
Trust me.

45:21.451 --> 45:24.054
Nicole's much safer
out of the city anyway.

45:24.086 --> 45:25.822
I mean, how do you know?
Are you just saying that?

45:25.855 --> 45:27.123
-Are you sure...
-No, look.

45:27.157 --> 45:28.992
-To make me feel better?
-Just, just imagine

45:29.025 --> 45:32.796
That the earth's crust over L.A.
is like a broken windshield.

45:32.829 --> 45:33.930
I don't understand.

45:33.963 --> 45:35.332
Like the crust
is like a windshield.

45:35.364 --> 45:36.799
I don't understand
what you're saying.

45:36.833 --> 45:39.302
I really need
a hammer to explain.

45:39.335 --> 45:40.269
Holy...

45:43.806 --> 45:45.274
-I see it.
-Faster!

45:45.307 --> 45:46.275
Hold on!

45:49.344 --> 45:50.747
-Jesus.
-Faster!

46:07.030 --> 46:08.431
Faster!

46:22.945 --> 46:25.414
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

46:25.447 --> 46:28.050
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Pray for us sinners now...

46:28.083 --> 46:29.585
Are you praying?
When did you start praying?

46:29.619 --> 46:30.988
I just picked it up!

46:35.090 --> 46:37.594
Jack, Jack, I-I...
I lost the phone.

46:37.626 --> 46:39.195
What? What?

46:39.228 --> 46:41.263
-We need that to find Nicole.
-I know. I'm sorry.

46:41.297 --> 46:43.465
It just slipped out
of my hands into nothing.

46:43.498 --> 46:44.600
Look,just, here,
just take the wheel.

46:44.634 --> 46:46.101
-God!
-Take the wheel.

46:46.135 --> 46:48.205
And don't stop driving.
Come on, take it!

46:48.237 --> 46:49.205
-Okay.
-Take it!

46:49.239 --> 46:51.141
I got it!

46:51.173 --> 46:52.409
I got it!

46:52.442 --> 46:54.043
-You got it?
-Yeah!

47:02.652 --> 47:04.021
Be careful!

47:05.521 --> 47:07.224
Steph, steady!

47:07.257 --> 47:08.892
I'm trying!

47:43.259 --> 47:44.894
Crap!

47:46.628 --> 47:48.431
I got it!

47:53.936 --> 47:55.438
I got it,
I got it, Steph.

47:57.273 --> 47:58.909
God!

48:05.380 --> 48:06.516
Steph, what are you doing?

48:06.548 --> 48:09.385
Hold on!

48:09.418 --> 48:10.619
My God!

48:11.621 --> 48:13.056
Steph, geez!

48:24.733 --> 48:26.001
<i>I think
this is a bigger problem</i>

48:26.034 --> 48:27.471
<i>than a broken windshield.</i>

48:34.177 --> 48:36.246
<i>Guys, help!</i>

48:45.088 --> 48:47.990
<i>Guys! Come help!</i>

48:48.992 --> 48:51.428
Hey, Teddy,
are you okay?

48:51.460 --> 48:52.395
Where are we?

48:54.597 --> 48:56.466
<i>I can not hold on much longer.
Please, please. Help me!</i>

48:57.532 --> 48:59.001
Cindy?

48:59.034 --> 49:00.603
My God!

49:00.635 --> 49:03.139
<i>Derrick, Cindy!</i>

49:03.172 --> 49:06.376
You guys, help!

49:06.409 --> 49:08.144
God!

49:08.177 --> 49:11.148
Jesus, fuck, that's...
That's high!

49:13.148 --> 49:15.018
-We have to get out of here.
-Guys, the windshield.

49:15.050 --> 49:16.319
-My God!
-Where's Warner?

49:18.153 --> 49:20.023
Guys, the windshield.

49:27.797 --> 49:30.766
Help!

49:30.800 --> 49:32.602
No, no, no.

49:32.635 --> 49:34.604
Help!

49:34.637 --> 49:35.772
God damn it!

49:35.804 --> 49:37.473
We're coming, Warner.

49:37.507 --> 49:39.075
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

49:39.108 --> 49:40.710
What do we do? What do we do?
Should we put it in reverse?

49:40.742 --> 49:43.545
I don't know,
but we've got to do something!

49:43.579 --> 49:45.449
Keep your weight on the car.

49:54.257 --> 49:55.759
Hey, hey, hey.
That's not such a wise idea.

49:55.791 --> 49:57.059
Nobody asked you!

49:57.092 --> 49:58.527
Guys, come on, come on.

50:01.764 --> 50:03.633
We're coming!

50:03.666 --> 50:04.634
Damn it!

50:04.666 --> 50:06.235
Cindy...

50:07.170 --> 50:08.471
We're gonna keep holding.

50:08.503 --> 50:09.772
You're gonna make your way
over to Warner

50:09.806 --> 50:10.807
and give him this strap.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.409
You'll pull him up?

50:12.442 --> 50:13.675
Once he's got the strap...

50:13.708 --> 50:15.177
<i>We let go of the car?</i>

50:15.210 --> 50:17.646
We grab the strap and we all
pull him in together.

50:23.552 --> 50:27.056
What the hell
is taking you so long?

50:27.090 --> 50:28.291
We're gonna do this, Cindy.

50:28.324 --> 50:30.293
Okay.

50:30.326 --> 50:33.262
<i>Mother of... wait!</i>

50:33.295 --> 50:34.297
We're coming.

50:55.885 --> 50:57.320
<i>Warner?</i>

50:57.353 --> 50:58.387
Cindy?

50:58.420 --> 51:00.589
I'm gonna hand you
the end, okay?

51:00.623 --> 51:01.825
<i>Okay, please hurry.
Hurry.</i>

51:01.858 --> 51:02.859
Okay, ready?

51:02.891 --> 51:04.159
Yeah, I'm ready.

51:04.193 --> 51:05.395
-Catch!
-Come on.

51:05.427 --> 51:07.163
You've got to get it closer,
please.

51:07.195 --> 51:08.531
-You got it?
-No!

51:12.735 --> 51:15.338
What is going on
up there, guys?

51:15.371 --> 51:16.405
Cindy, come on!

51:16.438 --> 51:18.273
I'm trying, I'm trying!

51:18.306 --> 51:20.076
Cindy, come on.
We can't hold it!

51:27.916 --> 51:29.351
Teddy, you moth...

51:29.385 --> 51:31.153
Catch!

51:38.860 --> 51:40.295
On the count of three.

51:40.329 --> 51:41.631
<i>-All right, let's go!
-Ready?</i>

51:41.664 --> 51:42.799
Yeah, I'm ready.

51:42.831 --> 51:44.201
One...

51:46.735 --> 51:47.769
Two...

51:47.802 --> 51:49.438
Goddamn it!

51:49.472 --> 51:51.474
Three.

51:51.507 --> 51:52.509
Fuck!

51:57.413 --> 52:00.449
No! No!

52:14.864 --> 52:16.398
Damn it!

52:16.431 --> 52:18.300
Nobody's picking up
at L.A. Emergency either.

52:20.969 --> 52:23.672
Great!

52:23.706 --> 52:25.175
What are you doing?
Don't stop!

52:25.208 --> 52:27.343
We're in a code red here.
We got carte blanche!

52:27.376 --> 52:28.678
I already have two points
on my license!

52:28.710 --> 52:29.945
Who cares?

52:29.978 --> 52:31.813
You're the new commanding
head of the USGS.

52:31.847 --> 52:33.383
Embrace the power.

52:33.416 --> 52:35.218
Just let me
do the talking.

52:49.664 --> 52:51.467
License, registration,
proof of insurance,

52:51.500 --> 52:52.300
please, ma'am.

52:52.333 --> 52:54.603
Officer, you see
those fires downtown?

52:54.637 --> 52:56.206
That's just the beginning.

52:59.775 --> 53:00.943
Sir, I'm not
addressing you.

53:00.976 --> 53:03.445
Marcus, please.

53:03.478 --> 53:05.547
License and registration,
please, ma'am.

53:05.581 --> 53:08.218
Yes. Just a moment.
It's...

53:08.251 --> 53:09.452
Show him your badge.

53:09.485 --> 53:10.720
Quiet!

53:10.753 --> 53:13.423
Sorry. It... I'm sure
it's in here somewhere.

53:13.456 --> 53:16.326
This is ridiculous.
Officer, we're in a hurry.

53:16.358 --> 53:18.927
Sir, I'm not addressing you.
I'll be with you soon.

53:18.960 --> 53:21.396
Ma'am, license
and registration, please.

53:21.429 --> 53:23.465
Just, it's in here
somewhere.

53:23.498 --> 53:24.466
I can't...

53:24.500 --> 53:26.436
I'm sure you have
a quota and all,

53:26.469 --> 53:29.505
but I highly recommend
you let this little fish go.

53:29.538 --> 53:32.608
Sir, this is
your last warning.

53:35.043 --> 53:36.545
Isn't that convenient?

53:36.579 --> 53:40.483
Michael T. Booker,
United States Geological Survey.

53:40.516 --> 53:42.918
You've just pulled over
two genius scientists

53:42.952 --> 53:45.021
whose data can prove
we're about to have

53:45.054 --> 53:46.521
the biggest earthquake ever,

53:46.554 --> 53:49.524
and this lovely doctor here
is the sole individual

53:49.557 --> 53:53.496
who can convince the governor
to evacuate the city.

53:53.528 --> 53:54.731
Hi.

53:54.764 --> 53:56.365
So unless
you want to be known

53:56.398 --> 54:00.302
as the cop who let 3.8 million
Angelinos die a tragic death,

54:00.335 --> 54:03.538
I suggest you get
on your bike and escort us

54:03.572 --> 54:07.777
to the L.A. Emergency
Management Center, pronto!

54:09.679 --> 54:11.914
Now, Ponch!

54:11.947 --> 54:13.816
You just stay
off your cell phone.

54:13.849 --> 54:15.785
Are you serious?

54:15.818 --> 54:17.653
Will do, officer.

54:17.686 --> 54:18.688
Follow me!

54:49.050 --> 54:52.389
<i>And we're coming up
on the Capital Records Tower...</i>

54:53.989 --> 54:56.326
<i>opened in 1956.</i>

55:00.528 --> 55:02.398
<i>Folks, calm down.
It's just a tremble.</i>

55:14.143 --> 55:16.813
So she isn't
safer out there.

55:16.846 --> 55:19.481
Only if Ritter returns on 5, and
he assured me that he wouldn't.

55:20.615 --> 55:22.585
He assured you.
The man is a known scumbag.

55:22.617 --> 55:24.086
You should have
left that job...

55:24.119 --> 55:25.721
Look, are we going to have
this tired argument again?

55:25.755 --> 55:27.523
I feel like you chose this jerk
over your own family.

55:27.556 --> 55:28.891
No, you were the one
who left me, okay?

55:28.923 --> 55:31.494
I recall giving you
several opportunities...

55:31.527 --> 55:32.795
Why, why are you turning?

55:32.827 --> 55:34.429
'Cause I need gas.

55:34.463 --> 55:35.665
There's, there's plenty of gas
in the tank.

55:35.697 --> 55:37.733
What we need to do
is get to our daughter.

55:37.766 --> 55:39.501
I don't know how long we'll be driving
around in this wilderness for.

55:39.534 --> 55:40.936
Nicole must be
terrified out there.

55:40.969 --> 55:42.404
But there's no station
out there.

55:47.076 --> 55:50.512
I think you're right.
Best not to stop.

55:52.414 --> 55:53.583
<i>These localized earthquakes</i>

55:53.615 --> 55:55.083
<i>have yet to be confirmed</i>

55:55.117 --> 55:57.019
<i>by the US Geological Survey
at CalTech</i>

55:57.052 --> 55:58.488
<i>which couldn't be reached...</i>

55:58.521 --> 56:00.490
I should have never let him
touch my hammer.

56:08.164 --> 56:10.467
They sure don't look
shut down.

56:23.545 --> 56:25.414
Yeah, I know.
I need a haircut.

56:29.217 --> 56:31.420
Okay. Follow me.

56:33.688 --> 56:34.656
A haircut?

56:38.626 --> 56:40.730
You need to show
confidence and grit

56:40.762 --> 56:42.465
if you want these guys
to listen to you.

56:42.498 --> 56:45.467
You know what you're doing,
so now convince them.

56:45.501 --> 56:46.702
<i>Then re-route the buses.</i>

56:46.735 --> 56:48.037
<i>Come on, people.
Use your head.</i>

56:48.070 --> 56:49.539
Where the hell is Booker?

56:49.572 --> 56:51.073
We're getting tremors
all through the city

56:51.106 --> 56:52.175
and I'm flying blind here.

56:52.208 --> 56:53.675
He's Booker, sir.

56:57.179 --> 56:59.014
I just sent two uniforms
down to CTech.

56:59.047 --> 57:00.582
Why the hell
hasn't he called in?

57:00.615 --> 57:02.184
Are either of you
even with USGS?

57:02.217 --> 57:03.219
Yes, I am.

57:03.251 --> 57:04.487
Emily Schiffman.

57:04.519 --> 57:05.688
I used to work
under Dr. Booker

57:05.721 --> 57:08.224
and this is our colleague,
Dr. Gladstone.

57:08.257 --> 57:10.659
Gladstone, the crank?

57:10.693 --> 57:13.062
Dr. Crank, if you must
go there, Lieutenant.

57:14.195 --> 57:15.898
You two know each other?

57:15.931 --> 57:18.568
Every other month, I get a warning
from the good doctor here.

57:18.601 --> 57:21.871
Bird flu epidemic, deadly pollen
virus... what was the last one?

57:21.903 --> 57:23.539
Shark hurricane?

57:23.572 --> 57:25.875
You have no idea how close that
came to actually happening.

57:25.907 --> 57:27.509
Now you said "worked."

57:27.543 --> 57:29.945
What did Booker fire you for,
being a crackpot, too?

57:29.978 --> 57:31.079
Dr. Booker is dead.

57:31.112 --> 57:33.114
We just came from USGS
with this data

57:33.148 --> 57:35.617
that we were planning
to show him, Lieutenant.

57:37.186 --> 57:39.521
No, no, no. I want
the Red Cross at the Bowl.

57:39.554 --> 57:41.890
Look, I don't give two craps
if Neil Diamond is sold out.

57:41.923 --> 57:42.958
Just get it done!
What?

57:45.059 --> 57:47.128
You need to evacuate
Los Angeles.

57:47.161 --> 57:49.865
Evacuate
the entire city?

57:49.898 --> 57:51.199
You're both nutbags.

57:51.233 --> 57:53.870
Lieutenant,
everything that's happened...

57:53.902 --> 57:59.574
The sinkholes are modest
seismic disturbances,

57:59.608 --> 58:01.143
and there'll be more.

58:01.175 --> 58:02.644
<i>Next...</i>

58:10.885 --> 58:14.757
<i>Next there'll be power surges
across the city.</i>

58:17.159 --> 58:18.561
I didn't save!

58:18.594 --> 58:21.230
And all of this
is nothing...

58:21.262 --> 58:24.733
Just little problems,
small potatoes.

58:24.766 --> 58:26.301
How are they just
little problems?

58:26.335 --> 58:27.970
What he's trying to say, sir,

58:28.003 --> 58:30.239
is that the faults underneath
the L.A. basin are cracking.

58:30.271 --> 58:31.773
Hey, small words.

58:31.806 --> 58:34.943
Which one was too big
for you... fault, basin, the?

58:34.976 --> 58:37.112
The lithosphere,
the crust of earth beneath us.

58:37.146 --> 58:40.550
South of the Sierra Madres
and west of Pasadena,

58:40.583 --> 58:42.552
it's breaking
into little pieces,

58:42.585 --> 58:45.186
and everything on top of it
is gonna crumble

58:45.219 --> 58:47.188
<i>and fall into the ocean.</i>

58:47.222 --> 58:49.559
Sir, what do you
want to do about the SDFD?

58:49.592 --> 58:51.661
Do I really have to do
everything around here?

58:54.663 --> 58:57.199
Put the SDFD on standby.

58:57.231 --> 58:58.701
And how do you suggest
we stop it?

58:58.733 --> 59:00.802
You can't control
an earthquake.

59:00.835 --> 59:01.636
Not true!

59:01.670 --> 59:03.039
What are you
talking about, Marcus?

59:03.072 --> 59:04.941
Epicenter containment.

59:06.275 --> 59:07.677
Where did you get that?

59:07.710 --> 59:09.345
Here's what
we're gonna do...

59:09.378 --> 59:11.681
We're gonna blow up
the original epicenter

59:11.713 --> 59:14.983
and create one ginormous
localized catastrophe.

59:15.016 --> 59:17.052
-Say, what?
-It's Emily's dissertation.

59:17.085 --> 59:18.920
It's her theory,
it's our plan.

59:18.954 --> 59:20.923
-It's a good plan.
-It's a C minus plan.

59:20.956 --> 59:24.594
You're suggesting that we
purposely destroy Long Beach.

59:24.626 --> 59:27.329
You'll have a good
7/8s of Los Angeles left.

59:27.362 --> 59:28.663
Is he serious?

59:28.697 --> 59:31.901
You're right,
he is a nutbag!

59:31.934 --> 59:35.138
People, it's Long Beach...
Who's gonna miss it?

59:40.809 --> 59:42.244
Okay, it looks like
we cross a stream

59:42.277 --> 59:46.248
and the ranger station's
one mile north.

59:46.280 --> 59:47.650
We should've
stayed on the road.

59:47.682 --> 59:48.951
I have no idea...

59:48.983 --> 59:50.953
Do we even know
that way's north?

59:53.755 --> 59:55.190
Cindy, is there any service
on that phone?

59:55.224 --> 59:56.726
Nope.

59:56.759 --> 59:58.994
Maybe we should just
retrace our steps and head back.

59:59.027 --> 01:00:00.195
Forget that.

01:00:00.228 --> 01:00:01.864
The road is about
three miles back

01:00:01.896 --> 01:00:03.331
and the ranger station's
one mile ahead.

01:00:03.364 --> 01:00:05.033
It's getting dark.

01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:07.369
That's right, and unless
you want to end up like Warner,

01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:09.771
stop bitching
and start moving.

01:00:09.804 --> 01:00:11.206
Derrick!

01:00:13.275 --> 01:00:14.675
Let's go, people.

01:00:18.746 --> 01:00:20.815
Cindy, make sure
not to get your phone wet.

01:00:20.849 --> 01:00:22.718
It's two feet deep,
genius.

01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:24.120
I think I can handle it.

01:00:24.152 --> 01:00:25.120
Let's go, people!

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:48.943
I'm stuck.

01:00:48.976 --> 01:00:50.712
My God!
It won't budge.

01:00:50.746 --> 01:00:51.780
Relax, it's over.

01:00:51.813 --> 01:00:54.983
God!
I was kind of scared.

01:00:56.851 --> 01:00:59.221
Careful, I don't
want to lose my shoe.

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:03.059
My God!
Is that another earthquake?

01:01:07.963 --> 01:01:09.432
My God!
Get me out!

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.067
Get me out!

01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:14.302
Get me out!

01:01:26.347 --> 01:01:27.750
I told you
to move faster.

01:01:29.117 --> 01:01:31.052
At least someone
enjoyed the show.

01:01:54.842 --> 01:01:55.844
Careful.

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:56.846
My God!

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.348
She's down there?

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.049
Nicole!

01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:03.085
Nicole!

01:02:03.117 --> 01:02:04.987
My God!

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:06.155
That's their car,
isn't it?

01:02:06.188 --> 01:02:08.356
Please, God.
Please let Nicole be okay.

01:02:08.389 --> 01:02:09.424
Here, hold this.

01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:11.027
What?
Be careful!

01:02:12.193 --> 01:02:14.262
Please, God, let her be okay,
let her be okay.

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:22.137
If the dog has a tag on,
maybe we can look call the...

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.271
Shut up about the dog!

01:02:24.572 --> 01:02:26.208
Teddy, what's going on
with the phone?

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.342
Can we fix it?

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:34.550
Eyes, focus, man.

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:36.519
Yeah, yeah.
It's trashed.

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:37.737
Sorry.

01:02:37.738 --> 01:02:38.921
Great.

01:02:38.954 --> 01:02:40.222
Guys, I don't know.
It's so dark.

01:02:40.255 --> 01:02:41.490
I say we head
for those caves back there.

01:02:41.523 --> 01:02:42.925
Yes.

01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:44.160
Wait, wait.
What if there's another quake.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.795
I don't want to get stuck
in a cave-in.

01:02:45.827 --> 01:02:47.329
Those caves
look pretty safe.

01:02:47.362 --> 01:02:49.865
I mean, that mountain's been
there for hundreds of years.

01:02:49.898 --> 01:02:52.968
I, I say we stick
to the ranger station plan.

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:54.303
-It'll, it'll...
-No! Okay, I'm freezing,

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:57.005
And I'd rather not get
eaten alive by a wild animal.

01:02:57.039 --> 01:03:01.210
If we hoof it now, we can make
it back in an hour easy.

01:03:01.242 --> 01:03:03.978
No. No.

01:03:04.012 --> 01:03:06.148
I'm not going into a dark
cave with you, Derrick.

01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:07.550
What, are you serious?
What is your problem?

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:08.884
Why are you attacking me?

01:03:08.916 --> 01:03:10.052
You know exactly
what my problem is.

01:03:10.085 --> 01:03:11.387
Are you serious?
You're the one

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.421
leading me on
for, like, months.

01:03:12.454 --> 01:03:13.522
-Leading you on?
-Yeah.

01:03:13.554 --> 01:03:14.522
-To that, really?
-Guys!

01:03:14.556 --> 01:03:15.958
Guys!

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:19.795
Look, I think we just found
our salvation.

01:03:26.534 --> 01:03:28.369
-That's disgusting.
-You're a sicko, dude.

01:03:28.402 --> 01:03:30.004
Look, dogs have this sense.

01:03:30.038 --> 01:03:31.606
This team
of Czechs and Germans

01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:33.842
recently discovered
that dogs align themselves

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:37.012
with the earth's magnetic fields
when they poop.

01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:40.983
So, that way is north.

01:03:41.016 --> 01:03:42.885
Are you... My God!

01:03:42.918 --> 01:03:43.952
You're a sicko.

01:03:43.985 --> 01:03:46.922
Nicole, you can join us,

01:03:46.954 --> 01:03:50.125
or you can be a stupid bitch
and follow the crap compass.

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:52.393
It's your choice.

01:03:52.427 --> 01:03:54.597
Follow a piece
of dog crap or you...

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.432
Hard to see the difference.

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.200
Good luck not dying.

01:03:58.233 --> 01:04:00.269
Teddy, you have fun
with Queen Blueballs.

01:04:00.302 --> 01:04:01.370
Let's go, Cindy.

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:02.904
-Cindy!
-Derrick's right.

01:04:07.909 --> 01:04:11.646
Fine, let's go, Teddy.

01:04:11.679 --> 01:04:13.148
Let's go.

01:04:31.132 --> 01:04:34.602
<i>Jack, Jack,
do you see her?</i>

01:04:34.635 --> 01:04:36.105
She's not here.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.120
Hello?

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:52.654
No, he... hold on,
hold on one second.

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.023
It's Hector!

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:56.425
Tell him
I'll call him back.

01:04:56.458 --> 01:04:57.927
I lost him.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.929
Wait, I have Paxton's and...

01:05:04.699 --> 01:05:06.034
What is this?

01:05:10.005 --> 01:05:11.340
Damn you, Ritter!

01:05:12.606 --> 01:05:14.409
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:15.544
Yes, sir.

01:05:15.577 --> 01:05:17.980
Yes, sir.
I pray so.

01:05:18.012 --> 01:05:20.982
Gladstone, Schiffman...
The governor is sending everyone

01:05:21.016 --> 01:05:22.952
below the 10 South
above the 10 North.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.153
You have your evacuation.

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.321
Now if there's anything
that we can do,

01:05:25.353 --> 01:05:27.021
I need you to tell me
that right now.

01:05:27.054 --> 01:05:28.523
Excuse me for one second.
I just have to grab this.

01:05:28.556 --> 01:05:29.557
Hello?

01:05:31.492 --> 01:05:32.628
<i>We're not
going to be able to stop</i>

01:05:32.661 --> 01:05:34.195
<i>all of the looting.</i>

01:05:34.228 --> 01:05:36.097
<i>-Sir?
-National Guard...</i>

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:38.166
Yes. What is it now?

01:05:38.199 --> 01:05:39.434
I'm afraid you're going to
have to ask everyone

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:40.502
to turn around.

01:05:47.641 --> 01:05:49.043
It's too unstable.

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:51.146
We're looking at
millions of lawsuits.

01:05:51.179 --> 01:05:53.715
Stop being Jack's
little lackey.

01:05:53.748 --> 01:05:56.351
At this depth, we're gonna
strike so much oil,

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:59.054
we can pay off any
government agency or whoever.

01:05:59.086 --> 01:06:00.389
I'm not worried.

01:06:00.422 --> 01:06:02.324
You're the only one
in L.A. who isn't.

01:06:02.356 --> 01:06:04.726
<i>One more detonation, sir,
then we'll turn on the pump.</i>

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.728
<i>One hour.</i>

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.130
Sir, please don't do this.

01:06:09.164 --> 01:06:12.167
Hector, relax,
my man, all right?

01:06:12.199 --> 01:06:14.502
Grab yourself
a glass of champagne

01:06:14.536 --> 01:06:16.405
and enjoy the show.

01:06:50.704 --> 01:06:52.040
<i>We know
the Long Beach station</i>

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.509
set off the first set
of fissures,

01:06:53.541 --> 01:06:55.576
<i>but Ritter's station
in the National Forest</i>

01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.246
<i>looks to be much deeper.</i>

01:06:57.278 --> 01:06:58.746
<i>There's a chance
we could crack the mantle.</i>

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.816
That will set off even more
dramatic quakes north of the city.

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:02.518
That's right
in the direction

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:04.186
we're sending half the people
we're evacuating.

01:07:04.219 --> 01:07:05.820
You're focusing on
the little problems again.

01:07:05.853 --> 01:07:08.156
How is falling into the ocean
a little problem?

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.425
Falling into
a lake of fire it is...

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.627
At that depth, we're getting
into pyroclastic flow.

01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:14.163
Pyro what?

01:07:14.195 --> 01:07:17.298
Super-heated gas pushes
molten rock to the surface.

01:07:17.331 --> 01:07:19.567
Fissures that deep
could expel magma

01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:21.769
at 450 miles per hour.

01:07:21.802 --> 01:07:23.304
Magma?
You telling me

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:25.441
L.A. is about to become
a goddamn volcano?

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:28.309
Well, I wouldn't phrase it
exactly like that, but yes.

01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:31.346
Either way, we cannot let
that station come online.

01:07:48.896 --> 01:07:51.299
I can't believe
she took that dork's side.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.469
How stupid can one girl be?

01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:54.735
I don't know. How?

01:07:54.768 --> 01:07:56.871
What?

01:07:56.905 --> 01:08:00.609
I mean, yeah,
Nicole's totally stupid.

01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:02.510
They both are.

01:08:02.543 --> 01:08:04.312
I think my nose is broken.

01:08:07.282 --> 01:08:11.820
So, what are you going to do
if there's bears in here?

01:08:11.853 --> 01:08:13.555
I'm gonna
trip you and run.

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:17.693
You better protect me.

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:18.693
We'll see.

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:27.903
Keep it charged.

01:08:27.935 --> 01:08:29.136
Carry a spare battery.

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.738
Blah, blah, blah.

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.608
If my dad had just
nagged me a little more.

01:08:34.876 --> 01:08:36.645
I, I have a thought.

01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:39.715
I read online that you can
charge a cell battery

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:41.215
with your body heat.

01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:42.617
How's that
going to work, Teddy?

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:44.286
We're both freezing.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.654
Well, if we put the battery
between us

01:08:46.688 --> 01:08:47.890
and then warm
each other up, then...

01:08:47.921 --> 01:08:49.157
Nice try, perv.

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:51.359
I said warm up,
not feel up.

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:52.461
Come on.

01:08:52.493 --> 01:08:54.228
It might work.

01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:58.166
All right. I can't believe
I'm going to do this.

01:08:58.198 --> 01:08:59.667
Hands above the equator.

01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:00.636
Just, yeah, yeah.

01:09:05.907 --> 01:09:08.944
Wiggle a bit.

01:09:08.975 --> 01:09:10.310
Wiggle?

01:09:11.746 --> 01:09:13.314
Okay.

01:09:17.652 --> 01:09:18.720
Okay.

01:09:23.858 --> 01:09:26.493
Sorry.
Yeah.

01:09:31.966 --> 01:09:34.868
The '89 San Francisco quake
was caused by a split

01:09:34.903 --> 01:09:36.703
<i>along the San Andreas fault.</i>

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:41.475
Coincidentally, that epicenter
was in a state park forest, too.

01:09:41.509 --> 01:09:42.210
Right.

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:44.313
That one was caused
by the MLB.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:45.613
Major League Baseball?

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:48.582
Just the Oakland A's
versus the Giants.

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.283
Battle in the Bay.

01:09:50.318 --> 01:09:53.221
No East Coast viewership,
worst television ratings ever,

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:55.489
so the commissioner
of baseball devised 12...

01:09:55.523 --> 01:09:57.259
Just shut up!

01:09:57.292 --> 01:10:00.896
I've had just about enough
of you running your mouth.

01:10:00.929 --> 01:10:03.632
The Bash Brothers...
Conseco and McGuire...

01:10:03.664 --> 01:10:06.467
Were genetically engineered
super soldiers...

01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:07.636
Just shut it!

01:10:07.668 --> 01:10:11.573
You are playing the quiet game
for the rest of the flight.

01:10:19.546 --> 01:10:20.681
Here.

01:10:20.715 --> 01:10:22.484
Let me check it.

01:10:22.516 --> 01:10:24.353
God!
I hope this worked.

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.761
Come on!

01:10:35.963 --> 01:10:37.265
<i>Man.</i>

01:10:40.001 --> 01:10:41.570
Yeah.
You like to play rough?

01:10:41.603 --> 01:10:42.637
Yeah, I do.

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:43.672
Yeah.

01:10:47.742 --> 01:10:49.645
What's the dog doing?

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:57.953
My God!
Did you feel that?

01:10:57.985 --> 01:10:59.387
Yeah!

01:11:07.595 --> 01:11:08.797
Listen...

01:11:08.829 --> 01:11:10.332
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:16.671 --> 01:11:18.340
Come on.

01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:21.943
-Derrick...
-Yeah.

01:11:21.975 --> 01:11:22.943
No, get off.

01:11:22.976 --> 01:11:23.912
Yeah, almost.

01:11:28.615 --> 01:11:31.019
Derrick, Derrick,
get off of me!

01:11:31.051 --> 01:11:32.753
No.
Not you, too.

01:11:32.787 --> 01:11:34.722
Really?
There's no way.

01:11:34.756 --> 01:11:35.791
Come on!

01:11:37.692 --> 01:11:39.694
Wait, look, it's on!

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:40.796
My God, yes.

01:11:50.137 --> 01:11:51.806
Nicole!

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.342
Nicole, are you out there?

01:11:56.110 --> 01:12:00.581
Look, Steph,
I know I always blamed you.

01:12:00.614 --> 01:12:04.019
I blamed Ritter,
I blamed the job,

01:12:04.051 --> 01:12:06.721
but it was me.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:09.757
I'm the one who put
our family at risk.

01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:11.393
We'll find her.

01:12:11.426 --> 01:12:13.495
Our daughter
is quite resourceful.

01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:17.498
I'm sure we will.
I know we will,

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:20.635
but that's not
what I'm trying to say.

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:23.505
But I, I always hoped
for a big payday,

01:12:23.537 --> 01:12:28.008
that that would solve
all of our problems...

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:32.448
Jack, we never asked you to.

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:38.086
Listen, I... I take
some of the blame.

01:12:38.118 --> 01:12:40.087
I mean, I hammered
you pretty hard

01:12:40.121 --> 01:12:42.757
for not
being there for us.

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:43.726
I know that.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:52.000
It's obvious that you were
always putting us first.

01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:53.836
You bet your sweet
babookie I did.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:03.545
Do you know
a Theodore Toblosky?

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.559
Light it up, T.J.

01:13:20.194 --> 01:13:21.630
It's magic time.

01:13:35.243 --> 01:13:37.979
Look, is that them?
It's them!

01:13:38.011 --> 01:13:40.916
It's them!
It's my dad's truck!

01:13:40.948 --> 01:13:41.949
Mom, Dad!

01:13:45.153 --> 01:13:47.989
Nicole, Nicole.
Thank God. Thank God!

01:13:48.021 --> 01:13:49.123
Put this on.

01:13:49.157 --> 01:13:50.859
Are you all right?
Is everything okay?

01:13:50.891 --> 01:13:52.159
Okay, kids,
let's get in the car.

01:13:52.193 --> 01:13:53.929
No, no.
We have to go to the station.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.797
Hector said that Ritter
was going to turn that thing on

01:13:55.829 --> 01:13:57.498
and start another
giant earthquake.

01:13:57.532 --> 01:13:59.568
I need to get you and the kids
to safety, okay?

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.969
Well, if he turns it on,
are any of us really safe?

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.604
We have to go!

01:14:03.637 --> 01:14:09.243
Sir, if this is a chance
to save L.A., I'm definitely in.

01:14:09.277 --> 01:14:11.480
Me, too.

01:14:11.512 --> 01:14:12.881
Okay. Get in the car.
Let's go!

01:14:12.913 --> 01:14:14.782
Come on! Quick.

01:14:50.217 --> 01:14:53.287
Yeah, I just talked to him.
It's not good.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.689
<i>-Which way?
-This way!</i>

01:14:59.627 --> 01:15:02.697
Ritter! Ritter!

01:15:02.729 --> 01:15:04.298
Turn it off.
Don't be an idiot!

01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:07.869
All right. USGS.
You're under arrest.

01:15:12.739 --> 01:15:14.009
Hey, Ritter,
turn it off.

01:15:15.342 --> 01:15:17.912
Get out of my way.

01:15:17.945 --> 01:15:20.681
I know my rights.
I did nothing wrong.

01:15:20.715 --> 01:15:21.917
We've got
to shut down the pumps.

01:15:21.949 --> 01:15:23.751
No, no, we have to
turn it up all the way.

01:15:23.784 --> 01:15:24.719
What?

01:15:24.752 --> 01:15:26.721
We use your hydraulic pump

01:15:26.753 --> 01:15:29.157
to expand the original
fissure point here.

01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:32.893
Amplify the initial fault
to constrain the epicenter.

01:15:32.926 --> 01:15:34.028
It's my theory.

01:15:34.061 --> 01:15:35.095
It's a good plan.

01:15:35.128 --> 01:15:36.197
I need your help.

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:38.132
If we can centralize
the pressure

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.167
building up in the crust...

01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:40.868
Hold on.

01:15:40.902 --> 01:15:42.304
The create a bigger
earthquake plan...

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:43.838
Excuse me, miss.

01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:45.673
Didn't you just say
that idea was nuts?

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.242
That was an hour ago.
Now it's all we've got...

01:15:47.274 --> 01:15:49.210
And it's not "miss."
It's Doctor.

01:15:49.243 --> 01:15:51.580
I'm sorry.
I still don't follow.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:52.747
The fault lines
are radiating,

01:15:52.779 --> 01:15:55.684
and the epicenter
is losing pressure.

01:15:55.716 --> 01:15:56.951
And you want to
fracture it more?

01:15:56.984 --> 01:15:58.219
Precisely.

01:15:58.252 --> 01:16:00.055
We use your pumps
at maximum pressure

01:16:00.087 --> 01:16:03.657
to localize the venting
of this fissure.

01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:04.693
That's insane!

01:16:04.725 --> 01:16:06.027
This place will become
unstable.

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.963
The forest will break
into a million pieces.

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.730
No, I think
that's the point, right?

01:16:12.399 --> 01:16:13.667
What are you doing?

01:16:13.701 --> 01:16:15.103
We need to
maximize these pumps.

01:16:15.136 --> 01:16:16.738
Turn it off Jack.
Don't do it!

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.172
Would you just get this guy
out of here?

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:21.810
Right now I'm not 100% sure
who I should be locking up.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.681
Okay.

01:16:26.713 --> 01:16:28.949
<i>I repeat,
The City of Los Angeles...</i>

01:16:28.983 --> 01:16:30.051
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:30.083 --> 01:16:31.251
Get out of my way!

01:16:31.284 --> 01:16:32.953
<i>Mandatory evacuation order.</i>

01:16:32.987 --> 01:16:35.891
<i>Coastal areas
are under a tsunami warning.</i>

01:16:37.891 --> 01:16:40.194
<i>Coastal areas
are under a tsunami warning.</i>

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:42.064
This... this isn't happening.

01:16:48.903 --> 01:16:51.873
My God!
What have I done?

01:16:51.905 --> 01:16:53.841
<i>Are you saying
you could stop this earthquake?</i>

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:56.744
No, no, certainly not.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.980
We might be able
to move it, though.

01:16:59.012 --> 01:17:00.814
Good.
Where?

01:17:00.847 --> 01:17:02.250
To right beneath our feet.

01:17:07.788 --> 01:17:10.090
I see all kinds of gases
in the backflow system.

01:17:10.123 --> 01:17:11.859
These outflow pipes
aren't going to hold.

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:13.028
<i>Well, then,
that's good, though.</i>

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.229
We want everything down there
to fracture.

01:17:15.262 --> 01:17:17.097
Let 'rip!

01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:18.100
Okay.

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:24.905
You ready?

01:17:45.025 --> 01:17:46.060
Damn it!

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:47.228
What is it?
What?

01:17:47.261 --> 01:17:48.997
It's not building
any pressure.

01:17:49.029 --> 01:17:52.833
The emergency shutdown valve...
If the system got overloaded,

01:17:52.867 --> 01:17:55.136
it... it must have engaged.

01:17:55.168 --> 01:17:56.805
It definitely got overloaded.

01:17:56.837 --> 01:18:00.074
Okay, we have to we have
to open the valve manually.

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.842
You saw what happened
to Paxton and Hicks

01:18:01.876 --> 01:18:03.078
when they tried to
open that valve.

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:04.345
I'm not going
down there again.

01:18:04.377 --> 01:18:06.081
We don't have a choice, okay?

01:18:06.113 --> 01:18:08.182
Look, we've got
at least 10 minutes

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:13.354
before all hell breaks loose...
Five minutes minimum.

01:18:13.386 --> 01:18:14.722
Come on!

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:15.856
<i>Diosito mio!</i>

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:27.101
Do you think
he stopped it?

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.837
I have no idea.

01:18:31.271 --> 01:18:32.506
Hey, guys.

01:18:32.539 --> 01:18:34.743
Who wants to go
for a helicopter ride?

01:18:38.179 --> 01:18:40.114
Look, I don't know about this.

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:42.050
Maybe I should rethink
this whole thing because...

01:18:42.082 --> 01:18:44.284
Lieutenant, what's the worst
thing that can happen?

01:18:44.318 --> 01:18:47.788
We can turn a pristine
national forest into a volcano

01:18:47.822 --> 01:18:49.090
or is that
another little problem?

01:18:49.122 --> 01:18:50.357
It is.

01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:51.492
We're going to lose
the entire city,

01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:53.327
so what's a few thousand trees?

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.530
It's kind of like whining over
a scratched tail light

01:18:56.564 --> 01:18:58.333
on a totaled Ferrari.

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:02.237
Go!

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.438
I love you.

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:05.306
Jack, isn't there
any other way?

01:19:09.476 --> 01:19:11.212
I'll be right back.

01:19:12.579 --> 01:19:14.815
You bet your sweet
babookie you will!

01:19:16.516 --> 01:19:17.551
You ready?

01:19:17.585 --> 01:19:18.836
I guess.

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:20.087
Wait, wait!

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:22.023
I'm the one
who altered the drill

01:19:22.055 --> 01:19:23.791
and ignored the warnings.

01:19:23.824 --> 01:19:25.793
It's my fault.

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:27.195
His fault.
You know, it's funny

01:19:27.228 --> 01:19:30.364
because he started
all the shifts in the faults.

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:32.534
Never mind.

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:34.569
Let me go
instead of Hector.

01:19:34.601 --> 01:19:36.104
I'm cool with that.

01:19:36.136 --> 01:19:38.239
All right,
knock yourself out, hot shot!

01:19:39.472 --> 01:19:41.141
Let's go!

01:19:41.175 --> 01:19:42.144
Wait!

01:19:48.481 --> 01:19:49.951
Come on!

01:19:49.984 --> 01:19:50.919
Jack!

01:19:55.088 --> 01:19:55.990
Hey!

01:19:58.626 --> 01:20:00.328
This doesn't change anything.

01:20:01.895 --> 01:20:04.032
You still deserve to die.

01:20:16.644 --> 01:20:19.079
It's going to be hot
down there.

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:32.327
The release valve's
about 20 yards away.

01:20:37.931 --> 01:20:39.099
It's on the right here.

01:20:41.368 --> 01:20:43.237
Damn! Hot!

01:20:46.039 --> 01:20:47.274
This ain't
going to be easy.

01:20:47.307 --> 01:20:48.275
No, sir.

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:56.885
Damn!

01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:06.293
All right.
Let's go!

01:21:10.096 --> 01:21:12.000
Damn it!

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.268
Pressure valve
is still on.

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:16.237
Help me turn it again
and I'll hold it open.

01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:20.208
Look, I wasn't serious
about you being dead.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.644
Hey, once I get back
in that helicopter,

01:21:22.676 --> 01:21:24.945
I'm a dead man anyway.

01:21:24.979 --> 01:21:26.414
Let's do this.
Come on!

01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:29.283
Come on!

01:21:38.591 --> 01:21:40.327
Now get out of here!

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.329
You know I don't like
to pay you overtime.

01:21:53.573 --> 01:21:54.942
Where are they?

01:21:54.975 --> 01:21:56.944
They should have
opened it by now.

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.313
We can't wait much longer.

01:21:58.345 --> 01:22:01.648
Wait, just give him a minute.
I know he's coming.

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:05.712
There he is!

01:23:05.746 --> 01:23:07.315
Dad, look out!

01:23:09.783 --> 01:23:11.585
Dad, look out!

01:23:18.692 --> 01:23:20.728
Where's... where's Ritter?

01:23:20.761 --> 01:23:22.063
He didn't make it.

01:23:22.095 --> 01:23:23.296
Come on,
let's get out of here!

01:23:23.329 --> 01:23:24.731
Wait, wait, wait.
Here, boy!

01:23:24.765 --> 01:23:27.301
Come on, come on.

01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:29.537
Come on, boy!

01:23:51.257 --> 01:23:54.194
Terminating aftershocks
are being felt

01:23:54.228 --> 01:23:56.663
throughout
Los Angeles County.

01:23:56.697 --> 01:23:58.065
Wha-what does that mean?

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:00.435
It means it worked...
We did it!

01:24:00.467 --> 01:24:01.502
We did it!

01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:07.609
I knew it would work!

01:24:10.644 --> 01:24:12.613
Pretty miserable day?

01:24:12.645 --> 01:24:15.849
Not so bad.
I got to second base.

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:19.287
Looks like
I'm out of a job.

01:24:22.422 --> 01:24:23.724
I'm sure I could find
some stuff

01:24:23.756 --> 01:24:25.559
for you to do
around the house.

01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:34.335
Wait!

01:24:34.368 --> 01:24:35.837
We've got to stop
for cheesecake!
