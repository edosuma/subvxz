WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:03.535
(drumming)
Ta-da!

00:03.537 --> 00:05.037
- Jaq: Oh.
- Bryce: Tasty treats!

00:05.039 --> 00:07.206
Are these your famous
three-ingredient scones?

00:07.208 --> 00:08.207
Yes, they are.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.341
Ooh, you can call me

00:09.343 --> 00:10.676
George Thorogood
& the Destroyers

00:10.678 --> 00:12.044
'cause I'm bad to the scone.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.912
(Laughing)
Get in there.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.614
Yeah, I learned how
to make these in prison.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.950
Um, where'd you get butter?

00:17.952 --> 00:22.087
You find it.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.623
(gulping)

00:24.625 --> 00:25.758
Wendy: (Grunting)
Little help here?

00:25.760 --> 00:26.825
Oh, Wendy.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.160
Oh, Wendy! Let me give you a--

00:28.162 --> 00:29.495
- Ooh, yeah.
- Oh.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.597
- Thank you, Howard.
- I was also gonna--

00:31.599 --> 00:33.265
(Sighing)
Sorry I'm late.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.200
Got myself into
a bit of a situation.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.435
Mm-hm?

00:36.437 --> 00:38.670
You know, my friend,
Dottie, in circulation,

00:38.672 --> 00:41.640
she's trying to save
some books from extinction--

00:41.642 --> 00:43.075
I'm sorry, "extinction?"
Is that the word?

00:43.077 --> 00:45.110
No. It's, uh-- Uncircu-fying?

00:45.112 --> 00:46.478
Deading. Deading a book.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.213
Either way, I offered to help.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.583
So, she sent me 10 of each book,
and anything we can do to help,

00:51.585 --> 00:53.185
she would really
greatly appreciate.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.421
So, what have we got here?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.890
How to Beat Any
Nintendo 64 Game.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.325
That's handy.

01:00.327 --> 01:03.429
Uh, and, Mansplaining--

01:03.431 --> 01:04.663
Well, that's, um...

01:04.665 --> 01:08.100
That's there.
And An Uncivil War,

01:08.102 --> 01:11.537
The Five Moments the South
Could Have Turned the Tide.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.939
Hopefully that's not
the Civil War we think it is.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.308
No. It, uh, it definitely is.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.644
I don't know, guys, maybe these
books should be Darwin-ized.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.680
Look, we shouldn't be
forced to circulate any book.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.549
As Granny Delora once said,

01:23.551 --> 01:25.350
"When something's
old and nearly dead,

01:25.352 --> 01:27.753
bury it before
the stench kills us all."

01:29.223 --> 01:31.657
Why does Dottie want us
to save these books?

01:33.394 --> 01:35.260
She didn't say and I didn't ask.
Look, I need a solid.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.464
Dottie only has eight fingers
and it's my fault.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.065
You know what?
I'll help. I'm sorry, what?

01:40.067 --> 01:42.568
Oh, Howard! Thank you.
Thank you so much. My hero!

01:42.570 --> 01:43.936
Yeah, I mean, it's my pleasure.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.370
You know, at Midtown
we always created demand

01:45.372 --> 01:47.206
by doing a book push.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.340
Oh, I love this!

01:48.342 --> 01:50.676
Use anyone
and anything you need.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.278
Seriously? Well, I'd kill
for a subcommittee.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.481
- Done. Jaq, Bryce.
- A subcommittee?

01:55.483 --> 01:56.515
Help Howard out.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.883
For Dottie!

01:57.885 --> 01:59.318
All (half-heartedly):
For Dottie.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.253
And for her
three-legged dog, Ringo.

02:01.255 --> 02:04.890
All (half-heartedly): And for
her three-legged dog, Ringo.

02:04.892 --> 02:09.628
â™ª

02:09.630 --> 02:13.599
Subcommittee! Our post-meeting
meeting begins, wait for it...

02:14.835 --> 02:17.536
Now! Roll call. Jaq?

02:17.538 --> 02:19.238
There are three of us.
We're here.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.639
Present. Bryce?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.075
Delightfully present.

02:23.077 --> 02:26.278
Alright, very good.
We have a quorum.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.915
So, at Midtown we used
a friendly competition to

02:29.917 --> 02:32.451
help push books that
we wanted off our shelves.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.886
One flaw.
Competition is a fundamental

02:33.888 --> 02:36.688
element of capitalism
and I'm a socialist.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.123
- (groaning)
- Remember, this isn't for me.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.559
- This is for Wendy.
- Jaq: Is it though?

02:40.561 --> 02:42.361
I sort of feel like Dottie's
the only one winning here.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.096
Lucky Dottie
and her eight fingers.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.497
Wendy: I'm just trying to help.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.066
Unhoused Wendy:
I don't care! I don't care!

02:48.068 --> 02:50.369
Wendy:
You're being so unreasonable!

02:50.371 --> 02:53.372
I'm leaving!
I don't feel safe here!

02:53.374 --> 02:54.940
What?!

02:54.942 --> 02:57.075
You're the one with a purse
full of sharpened toothbrushes!

02:57.077 --> 03:00.546
And I will not
hesitate to use one.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.647
(all gasping)

03:03.918 --> 03:06.118
Okay, I went too far.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.387
(all gasping)

03:08.389 --> 03:09.454
Wendy!

03:13.761 --> 03:16.361
Have those two ever
argued like that before?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.262
Never.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.764
I'm going to check on her.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.232
Oh, no, no. Just give her
a minute to cool down.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.400
You know what would
make her feel better?

03:21.402 --> 03:22.668
Hm?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.269
Is if the two of you
push books with me.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.205
Okay. Fine, but I'm not
saying "book push." Ew.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.306
Ah, you just did.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.543
(loud thudding)

03:34.515 --> 03:37.216
(beeping)

03:37.218 --> 03:38.450
It couldn't be simpler.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.820
See, there's three books
and three of us.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.189
Why don't we each take a book
and try to move it?

03:44.191 --> 03:47.292
And whoever gets rid of their
book first, wins something.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.594
Like what?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.295
Well, I'm meeting
Dane for lunch today.

03:50.297 --> 03:53.365
Maybe I could get him to give us
a couple of museum tickets.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.100
Oh, I thought it was going
to be something we wanted to do.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.702
you know what? I'm not
having this argument again.

03:56.704 --> 04:00.672
The Acropolis On-top-olis
exhibit was pure fire.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.074
Oh, it was fire, Howard?
It was pure fire?

04:02.076 --> 04:03.475
Okay, look,
I know where this is going--

04:03.477 --> 04:04.543
No. No, no, no, no.
As a fellow youth,

04:04.545 --> 04:05.944
I totes agree, fam.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.347
Museums aren't cringe,
they're lit, bitch.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.249
(groaning)

04:10.251 --> 04:11.283
Are you quite finished?

04:11.285 --> 04:12.718
Yes, bitch. Slay.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.019
Slay.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.722
How about extra paid days off?

04:19.827 --> 04:22.261
Wendy: She's stubborn and mean.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.563
Like a goat that
missed breakfast.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.664
Why was she so upset?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.032
Exactly! What's her problem?

04:27.034 --> 04:30.102
- No, no, no. I'm asking you--
- (bell dinging)

04:30.104 --> 04:31.837
Wendy, I need to use
the employee washroom.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.306
Someone's in the big, nice one
with all the handle bars.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.507
The accessible one?

04:35.509 --> 04:37.009
Just use the one
you're supposed to.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.910
I need privacy when
I am doing private things.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.579
And the stalls
aren't private enough?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.314
The gap by my feet
is unnerving.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.149
Go over to Coffee & Such, then.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.717
The place with the one-ply?

04:45.719 --> 04:46.852
You know, why don't you just
hand me sandpaper, Sheila?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.186
No, before it's too late,

04:48.188 --> 04:49.921
I'll have an accident
in the stacks.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.390
Yes, I'll do it.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.893
It's not an accident
if it's a threat.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.062
Okay, go!

04:57.064 --> 04:59.531
Thank you!

04:59.533 --> 05:01.099
He is far too comfortable.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.269
The individual with
the most books signed out

05:04.271 --> 05:07.906
by 5:00pm today wins
all three personal days.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.274
Pick a book, Jaq.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.709
Ladies first after all.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.678
Nope. Screw you. Bryce, you go.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.680
Finally,
a white man gets some love.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.781
Okay, you know what?
You ruined it.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.183
Alright. Uncivil War. What?!

05:18.185 --> 05:19.785
Okay, and I got Mansplaining--

05:19.787 --> 05:21.553
Nintendo 64.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.155
- I'll trade you?
- Please!

05:23.157 --> 05:25.424
I wanted Mansplaining, anyway.
It's an important book.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.658
And I'll tell you why,
young lady--

05:26.660 --> 05:28.160
Absolutely not.
No. Listen to me.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.195
No tradesies and no redraws,
this is what it is.

05:30.197 --> 05:34.533
Incipiant ludi.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.801
Let the games begin.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.836
(rattling)

05:37.838 --> 05:39.771
(knocking)
Excuse me.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.240
Hi.
It's Wendy, the branch manager.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.475
Is everything okay?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.147
Wendy? If that you in there?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.916
(rustling)

05:50.918 --> 05:53.919
This silent treatment
is real mature.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.288
(thudding)

05:56.290 --> 05:58.256
And it is not fair
that you're acting this way

05:58.258 --> 06:00.525
when you're the one who
should be apologizing!

06:01.862 --> 06:05.664
Is the name of a great
podcast I just started.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.467
Hey, Jaq.
How you doing with your book?

06:08.469 --> 06:11.002
Well, I haven't seen
any complete dill-holes yet,

06:11.004 --> 06:12.037
so I still have 10.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.405
Yeah. Me neither.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.107
I probably won't have
to try too hard, though.

06:15.109 --> 06:16.875
Okay, let's get you sorted.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.443
(chuckling)

06:18.445 --> 06:22.681
You know what? You are going
to love this book, you know?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.016
So important to read our
history so we don't repeat it.

06:25.018 --> 06:29.688
Or write about it again.
Alright, take care. All set.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.394
I'm sorry, guys.
That's two down, eight to go.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.129
- Easy peasy.
- Two down?! What the fu--

06:37.131 --> 06:39.097
Ew, gross. I'm not losing
to a guy who says "peasy."

06:39.099 --> 06:40.499
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.167
Hi, you look like you
like explaining things.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.769
- This is an excellent book.
- Hey, check this book.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.137
- You are gonna love this.
- It's called Mansplaining.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.338
You look like a nerd.
Are you a nerd?

06:51.145 --> 06:52.711
(creaking)

06:55.682 --> 06:57.582
(creaking)

06:57.584 --> 06:58.683
(gasping)

07:01.555 --> 07:03.922
The only way to
topple the patriarchy

07:03.924 --> 07:05.690
is by understanding it,

07:05.692 --> 07:07.426
and the only way
we can understand it is

07:07.428 --> 07:09.728
by reading this book. Bam!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.329
Are you reverse-mansplaining me?

07:11.331 --> 07:12.531
I see what you did there,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.232
but reverse oppression's
not a thing.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.602
Is this about how to stop
mansplaining or how to start?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.738
Which is better?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.506
Yeah, I'm gonna stick
with The Y Chromosome.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.275
Oh, I just read that,
it's amazing.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.876
It's actually my staff
pick of the month.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.678
And Mansplaining is next month?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.981
No. Oh, no. It's not my pick.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.818
Like, it's kinda--
I'm just trying to, um--

07:32.820 --> 07:34.486
If you read it,
it's a page turner.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.290
Um, hi.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.691
Welcome to Jameson.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.726
We are showcasing
some titles around here.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.729
Maybe this one catches your eye.
It's called Mansplaining.

07:44.731 --> 07:45.864
- I guess--
- Ah!

07:45.866 --> 07:47.466
I've been looking for this!

07:47.468 --> 07:48.900
Okay.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.303
You have no idea how
important this book is.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.573
(chuckling)
Okay, well, have a good day.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.408
Going on break
so I can throw up.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.977
I saw that. Very impressive.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.313
I love how you're
connecting with our community.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.349
It's all Howard's fault.
He's the worst.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.685
Or the best.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.087
Right this way
to periodicals, good sir!

08:09.089 --> 08:12.824
Oh, say.
Are you into civil wars?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.293
No, what I said.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.129
Good news!

08:18.131 --> 08:19.798
I got another book for you.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.166
I really want these five books.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.301
- Oh, take another one.
- You know I can't.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.036
My parents have
a very strict rule about

08:25.038 --> 08:26.638
how many books I can
take out at a time.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.939
What's that over there?

08:27.941 --> 08:29.007
(beeping)

08:29.009 --> 08:30.942
Hey, you just scanned that book.

08:30.944 --> 08:31.877
No I didn't.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.512
Yes, you did. Take it off.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.114
If my parents check my account,
they're going to ground me.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.415
They won't check.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.251
They check every time!
Take it off!

08:39.253 --> 08:40.919
I'll tell you what.
How about we don't scan

08:40.921 --> 08:42.821
one of the other books so it
looks like you've only got

08:42.823 --> 08:44.155
five in the system here?

08:44.157 --> 08:46.691
And then what?
I get hooked on taking out six,

08:46.693 --> 08:48.326
then seven, then nine?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.561
Until Dad checks my book-bag

08:49.563 --> 08:51.863
and I get busted
with 10 hardcovers?

08:51.865 --> 08:52.964
You know, it sounds like your--

08:52.966 --> 08:54.733
(slamming)

08:54.735 --> 08:57.903
Keep your gateway book.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.371
Okay.

09:00.607 --> 09:01.840
Thank you.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.242
Unscanned. There you go.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.178
Oops.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.847
(groaning)

09:11.251 --> 09:12.784
Howard, question for you.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.452
Yeah, anything.
What do you need?

09:14.454 --> 09:17.222
I just saw Jaq initiate
a conversation with a patron.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.456
What's going on?

09:18.458 --> 09:19.925
We're having a little contest,

09:19.927 --> 09:22.627
and the winner gets paid
days off from the others.

09:22.629 --> 09:23.628
Can you do that?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.096
Yeah, Wendy's cool with it.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.432
You know, she put me in
charge of the subcommittee.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.668
Looks like someone's
finally fitting in.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.969
Hey, do you have lunch plans?

09:30.971 --> 09:33.204
Do you want to
get something to eat?

09:33.206 --> 09:35.607
Yes! I mean, why not?
I mean, I like lunch.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.576
Well, great. Coffee & Such?
We can walk over together.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.411
Perfect.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.679
You're definitely not peeing.

09:40.681 --> 09:41.846
What gives?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.651
Wendy, we have to
talk eventually,

09:46.653 --> 09:48.687
and I'd rather
do it face to face.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.059
You know I was just
looking out for you, right?

09:54.061 --> 09:56.194
I actually care
about your wellbeing.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.630
Wendy?

09:59.866 --> 10:01.566
Alright, I'm getting the fob.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.101
Oh, did you hear?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.437
Two books left.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.206
Seriously?! I still have six!

10:08.208 --> 10:09.341
Seven.

10:09.343 --> 10:11.409
No, that's it.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.477
What are you doing?

10:12.479 --> 10:13.678
Nothing.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.213
She's pushing
her book on our social!

10:15.215 --> 10:16.414
That's the library's account,
Jaq!

10:16.416 --> 10:17.949
You gotta push all the books.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.417
Well, then I guess you should
log in and make a post.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.785
By the time
I figure out how to do that,

10:20.787 --> 10:22.387
all your books'll be gone!

10:22.389 --> 10:23.922
Then I guess you should've
listened when I young-splained

10:23.924 --> 10:25.223
social media to you.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.592
Fine. Time to bring out
the heavy artillery.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.531
Here today, scone tomorrow.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.833
- Hm.
- Hah!

10:37.971 --> 10:40.472
Okay, finally. Guess what?

10:40.474 --> 10:44.009
I am about to go to lunch
in a minute with Sheila.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.211
I know! She asked me.
Can you believe it?

10:46.213 --> 10:47.379
That's huge. Are you nervous?

10:47.381 --> 10:48.446
A little. What do you think?

10:48.448 --> 10:50.081
Tuck or untuck?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.017
You're a badass mother-tucker,
Howie.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.251
Okay, I know you meant
that sarcastically,

10:53.253 --> 10:54.886
but I'm taking it
as a compliment.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.721
That means that
you'll be gone for a while.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.089
Perfect.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.691
Jaqueline, do not make me laugh.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.760
I will be back soon enough
to wrap up this competition

11:01.762 --> 11:02.961
in a neat little bow.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.596
Yeah, probably.

11:04.598 --> 11:05.930
I don't think my post about
mansplaining will get much

11:05.932 --> 11:08.566
traction on a the Internet.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.502
Oh, Howard. Howard's thinking,

11:10.504 --> 11:13.805
"Sheila, day off,
Sheila, day off."

11:13.807 --> 11:15.473
Oh, a potential soul mate or--

11:15.475 --> 11:19.744
or a day to get paid to
delve into new exhibits.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.514
Ugh!
E pluribus unum, what to do!"

11:22.516 --> 11:24.215
Now you're thinking,
"She's misusing Latin !

11:24.217 --> 11:26.751
Do I correct her
or go on my date?

11:26.753 --> 11:29.154
Is this even a date?"
(grunting mockingly)

11:30.924 --> 11:32.123
(both grunting)

11:33.960 --> 11:36.227
Bryce: Okay.
(chuckling)

11:36.229 --> 11:37.829
Alright.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.965
Jaq: Right over here, gentlemen.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.601
Okay. One for you,
and one for you,

11:43.603 --> 11:47.405
and one for you,
and one for your friend?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.841
Eh? You got a friend
who wants this? Yeah?

11:49.843 --> 11:50.875
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.177
You guys don't want that book.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.578
It's marked.
There's a lady lib group

11:53.580 --> 11:55.380
that tracks any man
that checks it out,

11:55.382 --> 11:57.749
and if they catch you--
(clicking, popping)

11:57.751 --> 11:59.050
Okay, don't listen to him,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.452
and I wouldn't eat
that if I were you.

12:00.454 --> 12:01.586
He learned how to
make those in prison.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.821
They're
three-ingredient scones.

12:02.823 --> 12:07.258
One of the ingredients
is butter.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.362
They are-- They are delicious!
This is discrimination, Jaq!

12:11.364 --> 12:12.664
Get your books here!

12:12.666 --> 12:15.967
How to Beat Any
Nintendo 64 Game!

12:15.969 --> 12:17.168
Like, all of them!

12:17.170 --> 12:18.737
- Man: Hey, dawg! Dawg!
- Yeah? Yeah?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.739
Cut it with all that noise, fam!
This a library, dawg.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.906
Sorry, sorry.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.108
Man:
And why them scones so dry?!

12:23.110 --> 12:25.310
They too dry even
for scones, fam!

12:25.312 --> 12:28.680
Okay, I-I am sorry,
but, um, now it seems like

12:28.682 --> 12:30.215
you're being the loud one.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.449
Man: Touche.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.784
Howard: Thanks for lunch.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.918
It's nothing.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.220
Thanks for saying yes.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.822
Hey, you two want
some carrot muffins?

12:37.824 --> 12:39.090
Mom.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.525
It's okay.
My mom's a food pusher too.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.060
We're fine, thank you.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.828
Oh, she don't care
about feeding us.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.263
Why you pushing muffins,
Old Lady?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.631
(sucking teeth)

12:46.633 --> 12:48.433
Your fool of a father
bought an extra dozen.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.201
They gon' expire. Take them, no?

12:50.203 --> 12:51.803
Mom, we're good. Leave us now.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.371
I'll bring six.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.240
You can take them
back to the library.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.344
Hey, how come I never see
your mom and dad here together?

12:59.346 --> 13:01.212
I mean, I know they're divorced,
but it can't be that bad.

13:01.214 --> 13:04.482
Oh, it's bad.
Like, stabbed-in-the-leg bad.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.619
So, did she stab him
or did he stab her?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.621
Mm. Yes.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.556
Oh, God.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.124
Well, then I'm glad
that I dodged

13:13.126 --> 13:14.893
the whole marriage bullet.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.163
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be insensitive.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.098
I know that things are kind of
rough with you and your ex.

13:20.100 --> 13:24.002
It's okay. The divorce
is almost official now.

13:24.004 --> 13:24.969
Really?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.204
Dane: Really?

13:26.206 --> 13:29.240
Dane!
I mean, Dane, this is Sheila.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.608
Sheila, this is Dane.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.011
Would you excuse me
for one second?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.245
Yeah.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.313
Dude, I am so sorry.
I totally forgot,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.749
but Sheila asked me to lunch.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.652
I took two streetcars here,
dude. Two.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.853
You poor thing. I'm so sorry.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.254
I promise
I'll make it up to you.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.089
But it's good to
see you as usual!

13:45.091 --> 13:48.259
You know what?
Try a muffin, carrot.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.128
Does he want to join us?

13:50.130 --> 13:53.097
Uh, no. He's got one
too many streetcars to ride.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.732
No, no, no, no, no. You can't
send these out yourself.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.601
That doesn't count, right?

13:56.603 --> 13:57.836
Oh, I know.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.973
These are perfect
for your LAN party.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.174
LAN party?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.275
You're not
the only one who knows

14:04.277 --> 14:06.477
how to use the Internet, Jaq.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.613
Ever hear of Reddit?

14:08.615 --> 14:10.148
Have you?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.282
Have a great day.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.250
No, don't...

14:12.252 --> 14:14.485
One book left.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.321
- No. No, no.
- (imitating explosion)

14:17.624 --> 14:20.925
The key fob is in
here somewhere, I know it.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.327
(groaning)

14:22.329 --> 14:24.729
(knocking)
Wendy, open up!

14:24.731 --> 14:26.664
It's too far now.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.367
Do you want me to get the tools?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.301
(groaning)

14:30.303 --> 14:33.872
No, Ervin. It's okay. Thank you.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.145
I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm-- I'm sorry.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.884
I didn't know that
finding you a place to live

14:45.886 --> 14:47.752
would be such
a terrible thing.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.523
It took forever to
get you into that program.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.262
Oh...

14:57.264 --> 14:58.997
I over-stepped, didn't I?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.934
You know me.
I'm passionate. I--

15:05.205 --> 15:07.772
I don't know why this
isn't a good thing for you,

15:07.774 --> 15:10.408
but I'm listening now.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.442
(thumping)

15:11.444 --> 15:12.477
So, what's up?

15:12.479 --> 15:14.245
(thumping)

15:14.247 --> 15:15.280
(loud crashing)

15:15.282 --> 15:16.347
Wendy?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.417
Wendy!

15:19.419 --> 15:20.885
(knocking)
Wendy!

15:22.622 --> 15:23.788
Stay alive!

15:26.893 --> 15:29.227
Hey, you look like a loser.
In a good way.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.896
Wendy:
Help! Help, it's Wendy!

15:31.898 --> 15:32.964
We gotta get that washroom open!

15:32.966 --> 15:34.198
What happened?!

15:34.200 --> 15:35.266
I don't know.
I think she collapsed.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.068
The door is stuck.

15:37.070 --> 15:41.205
Oh, no.
I am not a ginger beer guy.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.774
You trust me?

15:42.776 --> 15:45.810
That's a trick question.
So, yes.

15:45.812 --> 15:46.911
Have at it.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.448
- Mm!
- (laughing)

15:50.450 --> 15:53.084
Wow.
That tastes like a temperature.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.320
It's good to know
that you trust me.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.322
I'm not sure I do anymore.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.590
I miss joking with people.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.159
It's been a while.

16:03.163 --> 16:07.198
Well, what happened with Adonis?

16:07.200 --> 16:12.270
I'm just not the person
I was when I was 23. You know?

16:12.272 --> 16:13.304
Yeah.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.106
Huh.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.107
What?

16:16.109 --> 16:18.810
My ex, I think that, well,

16:18.812 --> 16:20.378
maybe she might be
in the same boat.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.815
You know.
The S.S. I've Outgrown You.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.116
(laughing)

16:25.118 --> 16:26.951
I'm sure it wasn't
the same thing.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.087
Look, I'm not upset anymore.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.655
She was right.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.223
Just took me a while to see it.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.692
How long did it take you?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.396
Just now.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.369
Well, personally, I think you're
a really good guy, you know?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.738
You're smart, you're attentive,

16:46.740 --> 16:49.841
you're easy to talk to.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.411
So easy that I forgot the reason
that I asked you to lunch.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.881
I am taking my finals soon
and I need help studying.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.150
It's weird, I know, but you just
are so detail-oriented,

16:59.152 --> 17:00.551
you know all that Latin--

17:00.553 --> 17:01.652
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes!

17:01.654 --> 17:03.021
Tu in me.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.789
You in me?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.724
No, no! "Tu in me."

17:06.726 --> 17:08.860
It's Latin for "you can
depend on me." I'll help.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.930
Oh. Oh, okay. Thank you.

17:12.932 --> 17:16.067
It would mean
seeing me outside of work.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.770
Well, look, I think I'll manage.

17:18.772 --> 17:21.672
- (spitting)
- (laughing)

17:21.674 --> 17:22.940
You got a soft throat.

17:24.911 --> 17:25.877
(beeping)

17:25.879 --> 17:27.078
(snapping fingers)

17:29.949 --> 17:31.549
What's going on here?

17:31.551 --> 17:32.583
Wendy's in there,
we think she's hurt.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.253
Okay, almost got it, and-- Yeah!

17:35.255 --> 17:37.288
(gasping)

17:37.290 --> 17:38.656
Wendy?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.058
(all gasping)

17:40.060 --> 17:41.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.960
Jaq, say something to it.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.629
I'm Native,
not a (bleep) superhero!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.597
Howard:
It's staring right at me.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.899
Easy, Howie.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.001
(growling)

17:50.003 --> 17:51.836
- Oh--
- Oh, my God.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.271
Everybody, just don't worry.
Don't sweat.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.106
-Bryce: It can smell confusion!
-(overlapping screams)

17:55.108 --> 17:57.208
Bryce: Cover your bits!
Cover your bits!

17:57.210 --> 17:58.242
Open the door, Howard!

17:58.244 --> 17:59.210
Howard: No!

17:59.212 --> 18:00.812
Bryce:
You're right next to it!

18:03.950 --> 18:05.183
Where's Wendy?

18:05.185 --> 18:07.218
I don't know.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.553
Wendy was a racoon.

18:16.996 --> 18:20.298
Oh, how was lunch?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.567
Good, not great.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.369
Hey, team.
Looks like that raccoon was

18:25.371 --> 18:27.472
living in our ceiling
for a while.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.140
Mm.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.575
Would explain the smell.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.176
But, hey! Thank you so much
for the book push!

18:32.178 --> 18:34.846
Watching you all engage
with our community was exactly

18:34.848 --> 18:38.316
what I needed today,
plus or minus a toilet raccoon.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.750
Well, it was our pleasure.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.052
Oh, and Dottie called.

18:41.054 --> 18:43.721
She's tracking the books
and she is so happy.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.823
Dottie is happy that
books about the South winning

18:45.825 --> 18:48.326
the Civil War are moving?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.827
Mm-hm.

18:49.829 --> 18:54.198
Wendy, I don't think this
Dottie is a good friend for you.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.000
Oh, she's adorbs.
You would love her.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.503
She is a part-time archer!

18:58.505 --> 18:59.904
- Sorry, part-time?
- Why would we love that?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.639
I'm starting to
think Dottie's not real.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.241
- Oh, yeah. No, totally!
- That she exists.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.375
It makes sense
that she doesn't exist,

19:04.377 --> 19:05.843
because I don't understand--

19:05.845 --> 19:08.079
(meowing)

19:08.081 --> 19:09.480
Have you done this before or?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.815
Uh, something like this.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.717
There it is.
I was looking for that.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.920
- Thank you, Saint Anthony.
- Wendy!

19:15.922 --> 19:17.855
Geez!

19:17.857 --> 19:20.424
I'm so sorry. I-- I overstepped.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.093
I promise I will consult you

19:22.095 --> 19:24.595
if I ever do anything
like that again.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.698
Good, because you don't
know what's best for me,

19:27.700 --> 19:29.100
and that place you got me

19:29.102 --> 19:32.770
is wrong for a hundred reasons.

19:32.772 --> 19:33.871
A hundred reasons?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.406
It's outside of the city.

19:35.408 --> 19:38.242
All my health resources
are here in Parkdale.

19:38.244 --> 19:41.712
All my food resources.
All my friends are here.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.881
Aww, we're your friends.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.583
Don't make me regret this.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.719
Listen,
I've done programs like that

19:48.721 --> 19:50.788
and they always end badly.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.391
Okay.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.259
But where have you been all day?

19:55.261 --> 19:57.995
As you know, once a year

19:57.997 --> 20:02.767
me and my squad
go through Drake's garbage.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.602
(gasping)
Drake Day!

20:04.604 --> 20:06.003
Has it been a year already?

20:06.005 --> 20:09.473
Oh, and this year
his trash was lit.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.708
(both laughing)

20:10.710 --> 20:13.678
Check this out.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.382
- I found this.
- Oh.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.084
It's an Aubrey.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.085
- Wow.
- Yes.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.086
What's it for?

20:22.088 --> 20:23.421
I have no idea.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.989
(both laughing)

20:24.991 --> 20:27.358
Maybe he got it for wearing
those skinny little beards.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.659
Oh, the skinny beards to
match the skinny jeans.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.727
Yes.

20:30.964 --> 20:31.529
Oh, the skinny beards to
match the skinny jeans.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.831
It's almost home time.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.333
Looks like it's gonna
end in a tie, guys.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.634
Mm-hm. Oh, Howard,
we forgot to tell you that

20:36.636 --> 20:38.169
your friend came by earlier.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.938
He knows. He knows.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.006
Dane, you came back.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.608
Do you wanna grab some dinner?

20:43.610 --> 20:47.712
Mm, got plans. I'm gonna curl up
with this book tonight.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.280
(gasping)

20:49.282 --> 20:50.648
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
- Um, no. We've got other books.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.849
Exactly. I promise you,

20:51.851 --> 20:52.950
you don't know
what you're doing.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.185
Oh, I do.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.087
Bryce:
Bag it and tag it, Howie. Woo!

20:56.089 --> 20:58.723
Dane, I mean.
There's two other books here.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.991
You haven't left
the library yet.

20:59.993 --> 21:01.425
Technically,
you haven't gotten it.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.560
You can change your mind,
it's not too late!

21:02.562 --> 21:04.328
(humming rhythmically)

21:04.330 --> 21:05.396
Jaq: Oh, my.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.065
(humming rhythmically)

21:08.067 --> 21:10.334
Ooh!
(grunting)

21:10.336 --> 21:11.402
Jaq: No.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.247
Man: You happy now?
