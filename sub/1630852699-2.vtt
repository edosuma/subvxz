WEBVTT

00:59.184 --> 01:00.101
Light green.

01:23.958 --> 01:24.793
Can I help you?

01:24.876 --> 01:27.170
Oh, no. I'm just bringing--
I'm their neighbor.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.713
Oh my God. Oh, you must be Anna.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.299
Yeah. Neil said you guys had
such a wonderful time last night.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.385
Aw. Are those for Emma?
Oh my God. Aren't you the sweetest?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.930
-I can give them to her for you.
-I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:37.013 --> 01:40.183
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
I must be jet-lagged from work.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.143
I'm Lisa, Neil's girlfriend.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.686
Yeah.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.106
-Hey, babe.
-Hey, babe.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.484
-We said it at the same time.
-How are you doing?

01:49.984 --> 01:51.402
-Hi, Anna.
-Hi.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.695
-Hey, kiddo.
-Oh, hi, Anna.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.365
Oh my God. There was barely,
like, any traffic from the airport.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.325
Yeah. We didn't think
we'd see you before school.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.120
I'm so tired, and they've got me
on the 9:20 to Seattle tonight.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.830
-Oof.
-Oh, here you go.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.957
-Thank you.
-Those are actually from me.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.126
Do you have any cash?
I need to tip the driver.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.211
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, yeah.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.047
So, did you guys get to meet?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.006
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:12.715 --> 02:13.550
Hmm.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.553
-Oh. Do you have anything smaller?
-Uh, no. I don't.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.597
-Come on, Dad. We're gonna be late.
-I'm coming. I'm coming.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.934
-Anna, do you need anything?
-No. Yes, good.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.853
I just wanted to give her the markers.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.272
-Markers?
-Bye, Anna.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.775
Wait. Group hug.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.258
Oh my God.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.476
Goddamn it.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.407
I can't believe Anna
just shows up at school like that.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.203
I can. I mean, she is batshit crazy.

03:23.286 --> 03:27.123
I set her up with a client of Scott's,
and she flaked. She totally flaked.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.667
No call, no text, nothing.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.920
Did you know she has a drinking problem?

03:32.003 --> 03:34.589
-No.
-Yeah. A serious drinking problem.

03:34.672 --> 03:38.218
Oh. And we have this new neighbor,
and she's just throwing herself at him.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.719
Oh God.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.847
I know. And he has a girlfriend.
It's so embarrassing.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.308
-It's so sad.
-It's tragic.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.144
But you can't be a victim
for the rest of your life.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.563
-Bad things happen to everybody.
-Yeah. That's true.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.362
That definitely
doesn't work for me.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.656
I know. I'm so sorry about that.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.999
What the fuck are you doing?

04:20.426 --> 04:22.303
That's not what we discussed.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.688
You know what? Let me call you back.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.399
Hi.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.151
Is something wrong with the markers?

04:37.235 --> 04:42.490
Hi. Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
Yeah. These just have such a weird smell.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.410
I have such a sensitive nose.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.078
Oh.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.456
Um, I didn't realize they smelled.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.709
I'm just really sensitive
to that kind of stuff.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.838
-Okay.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.968
I'm gonna go put my car in the driveway.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.512
It was so good seeing you.

05:04.595 --> 05:05.471
You too,

05:06.973 --> 05:07.974
bitch.

05:08.766 --> 05:09.684
What was that?

05:10.184 --> 05:11.019
Huh?

05:11.686 --> 05:12.687
Oh, did you say something?

05:13.938 --> 05:14.897
No. Uh-uh.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.378
Shit.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.223
-Hey.
<i>Hello, Anna. How are you feeling?</i>

05:49.307 --> 05:50.141
Uh…

05:50.975 --> 05:51.809
…crazy.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.519
<i>Crazy how?</i>

05:54.687 --> 05:59.525
Where do you want me to start?
Um, I've been hearing noises in the attic.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.613
<i>You live in an old house, right?</i>
<i>Old houses creak.</i>

06:04.155 --> 06:06.282
I saw Elizabeth playing in her room again.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.117
What's your explanation for that?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.702
<i> We talked about that.</i>

06:09.786 --> 06:12.914
<i>Imagining you see her</i>
<i>is part of the trauma.</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:14.415
<i>How's the drinking?</i>

06:14.499 --> 06:17.001
Great. I'm really cutting back.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.587
<i>And the pills I prescribed?</i>

06:20.713 --> 06:22.715
<i>You know not to combine them</i>
<i>with alcohol. Right?</i>

06:22.799 --> 06:23.633
I'm not.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.761
<i> I'm serious, Anna.</i>
<i>That can contribute to the hallucinations</i>

06:26.844 --> 06:28.679
<i>and can even cause a psychotic episode.</i>

06:28.763 --> 06:29.764
I said I'm not.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.767
Jesus. I'm so sick of talking
I could scream.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.103
I mean, I feel like I could kill somebody.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.855
<i> Maybe you could try</i>
<i>coming into the office.</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:43.194
I already told you,
I can't risk driving all that way

06:44.070 --> 06:45.822
and getting caught in the rain.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.866
<i> Let's talk about that.</i>
<i>The ombrophobia.</i>

06:48.950 --> 06:50.451
Let's just call it what it is.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.205
I'm a crazy person
who's afraid of the rain.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.999
<i> Anna, you have good reason</i>
<i>to fear the rain.</i>

06:57.083 --> 06:59.502
<i>It's linked to the worst day of your life.</i>

07:00.503 --> 07:04.257
<i>I know it's painful, but it might help you</i>
<i>to talk about that day.</i>

07:05.716 --> 07:06.551
I don't know.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.637
<i>Tell me about that day, Anna.</i>

07:16.269 --> 07:18.521
It was Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.066
Have fun.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.151
Come on, sweetie.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.196
Oh! Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.824
Smile.

07:33.744 --> 07:34.954
Okay. Bye, guys.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.207
-Bye, Mommy.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.795
-Oh.
-Hold on.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.882
Here you go, baby.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.800
Take this. Bye.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.725
<i>Elizabeth was so excited</i>
<i>to be going with her dad,</i>

07:57.435 --> 08:01.939
<i>a forensic psychiatrist for the FBI</i>
<i>specializing in serial killers.</i>

08:11.240 --> 08:14.952
<i>Elizabeth went into a room</i>
<i>with a serial killer</i>

08:15.036 --> 08:18.706
<i>who had murdered and eaten</i>
<i>at least 30 people.</i>

08:26.714 --> 08:28.716
<i>Just before the assessment began,</i>

08:28.799 --> 08:31.260
<i>the warden needed to discuss</i>
<i>an urgent matter.</i>

08:36.724 --> 08:40.978
<i>The warden shut the door,</i>
<i>accidentally locking them out of the room.</i>

08:41.062 --> 08:43.356
<i>Our eight-year-old daughter was left alone</i>

08:43.439 --> 08:46.025
<i>with a man who the authorities nicknamed</i>

08:47.693 --> 08:49.028
<i>Massacre Mike.</i>

08:51.697 --> 08:53.366
- <i>Anna?</i>

08:53.449 --> 08:55.576
Uh, I can't do this. I'm sorry.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.519
You have two phones?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.647
What are you, a drug dealer?

09:30.528 --> 09:32.780
Who the hell are you?

10:25.374 --> 10:27.668
Lisa Maines.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.471
Jesus.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.556
Love yourself much?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.935
Okay. So if you're not gonna
answer my calls,

10:45.019 --> 10:47.188
I'm gonna have to drop by unannounced,

10:47.271 --> 10:48.814
which no one likes.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.484
Who takes a selfie while they're laughing?

10:51.567 --> 10:54.320
Either laugh or take a selfie.
You can't do both at the same time.

10:54.403 --> 10:58.032
-What are you looking at?
-Neil's shady girlfriend.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.534
-Who's Neil?
He just moved in across the street.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.619
Oh.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.620
And his wife died.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.080
Okay.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.291
He's perfect.
He's got this little girl. She's so sweet.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.584
And we had something…

11:09.669 --> 11:13.464
something between us at dinner. We…

11:13.547 --> 11:16.592
And then…
I… I wasn't imagining it. It was real.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.344
You had dinner with him?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.722
-Yes.
-Didn't you just say he had a girlfriend?

11:22.306 --> 11:23.933
You're not understanding me. Um,

11:24.767 --> 11:27.103
he knows what it's like to lose someone.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.020
Hmm.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.481
And we had a connection.

11:30.564 --> 11:33.484
And then out of nowhere,
this girl shows up.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.779
And it doesn't make any sense
because he never mentioned her. Not once.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.573
If it were an important relationship,
don't you think he'd have said something?

11:39.657 --> 11:43.160
-Uh, well, Anna, I mean, I kind of--
I read her a bedtime story.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.662
The girlfriend?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.622
No. Emma.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.916
-Emma.
-Jesus Christ.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.293
-Sloane, she's got a burner phone.
-Emma?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.212
No. The girlfriend.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.298
I mean, who… who has a burner phone?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.259
I don't even know what a burner phone is.

11:58.342 --> 12:03.931
Oh, it's a second phone that you have
when you're like a criminal or a spy.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.808
Spy. Okay.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.976
Oh. Hold on.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.188
Who the fuck is Sexy Rexy?

12:11.272 --> 12:13.232
Hey, Anna. I… Why don't we just--

12:13.315 --> 12:15.401
He's liked every single one of her photos.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.945
Look at this. Fire emoji, fire emoji.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.282
Eggplant emo… eggplant emoji?

12:21.365 --> 12:24.118
-Do you know what an eggplant emoji means?
-Yes.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.703
-It means a dick.
-I was…

12:26.203 --> 12:28.581
Shit. Sexy Rexy's private.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.167
Sexy Rexy's private.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.128
-You don't find that suspicious?
-No.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.797
Anna, I don't know
who any of these people are.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.341
Maybe Sexy Rexy was the one
she was talking to on the burner phone.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.218
Okay. Anna, you know I love you--

12:41.302 --> 12:43.012
I'm sending him a follow request.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.266
So, do you just… you just sit here
all day and watch these people?

12:47.349 --> 12:49.518
What are they up to?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.521
I mean, I have to tell Neil. Right?

12:52.605 --> 12:53.439
Anna, no.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.524
-I have to tell him.
-Nope. You gotta stop.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.985
Sloane, you don't… you don't get it.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.530
-It's fine. You don't understand.
-Honey, I do. I do. I understand.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.782
They're a family,

13:03.491 --> 13:04.867
and you want that back.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.411
Let me ju… I'm just gonna…

13:07.995 --> 13:09.622
Just for a second. Yeah.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.458
-No.
-Okay.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.586
What about painting?

13:15.669 --> 13:19.131
-Sloane…
-Anna, you are a great artist.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.591
Look.

13:24.428 --> 13:28.974
Elizabeth died that day,
but you did not have to die with her.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.409
It's like riding a bike.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.261
Fuck riding a bike.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.860
It's just ridiculous. Every single…

15:12.870 --> 15:14.079
Are you kidding me?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.290
-You're talking shit about me to Buell?
-Excuse me?

15:16.373 --> 15:18.626
I heard you and Beth Halloran
in the grocery store.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.044
Can you get that knife out of my face?

15:20.127 --> 15:22.546
Can <i>you</i> stop telling people
that I have a drinking problem?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.882
-Anna.
-And you think I'm batshit crazy?

15:24.965 --> 15:27.968
Talk to me when your kid dies,
and we'll see how batshit crazy you are!

15:28.052 --> 15:29.595
Seriously, watch it with that thing!

15:29.678 --> 15:32.514
Fuck you for buying
all the chocolate bars with almonds!

15:32.598 --> 15:33.933
Who the fuck does that?

15:34.016 --> 15:37.603
Anna, there is a new mailman,
and I just was asking Buell

15:37.686 --> 15:40.356
if any of our mail
had been delivered here by mistake.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.568
Scott is expecting
a very important letter.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.155
-Here you go, Miss Carol.
-Thank you.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.741
Carol, I… I…

15:51.325 --> 15:54.495
You know, I used to feel bad for you.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.163
I prayed for you.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.875
But I do not feel bad for you anymore,
and I will not pray for you anymore.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.877
-Carol…
-Seriously, Anna.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.587
You are no longer in my prayers.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.342
Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.763
Well, everybody makes mistakes, Miss Anna.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.139
I know I have, but…

16:16.141 --> 16:17.893
that's a story for another day.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.855
Okay.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.198
Oh, baby girl.
I just feel like I'm falling apart.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.076
Like a house of cards…

16:35.077 --> 16:38.414
…or like a sandcastle
when the tide has come in.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.748
I don't know.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.543
Like a rickety chair…

16:44.128 --> 16:45.963
…or an old jalopy. I don't know.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.723
Like that bridge that collapsed
between Riverton and Cobbleport…

16:59.018 --> 17:02.271
or the one that collapsed
between Sagamore and Nipper Island.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.272
I don't know.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.198
Anyway, that's how I feel…

17:13.282 --> 17:14.742
…like I'm falling apart.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.751
Looks like it's gonna rain.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.172
I better go. Love you.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.526
No, no, no.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.445
Oh God.

18:19.139 --> 18:19.973

18:30.651 --> 18:32.111

18:43.413 --> 18:46.041

my request. Look at these.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.567
Wow.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.027
You like what you see?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.238
Me likey very much.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.203
It's gotta be something sexy.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.370
What's sexy?

20:11.084 --> 20:11.919
Damn it.

20:18.967 --> 20:19.968
Bingo.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.505


21:09.893 --> 21:10.811
Wow.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.028
Holy shit.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.906
This was five days ago.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.081
Who the fuck is this girl?

22:52.245 --> 22:53.663
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

22:53.747 --> 22:56.625
There's a murder.
A woman has been murdered.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.920
406 Canterbury Hill.
Hurry!

23:00.003 --> 23:02.464
<i> Ma'am, slow down.</i>
<i>Can you repeat the address?</i>

23:02.547 --> 23:04.591
406 Canterbury…

23:04.674 --> 23:06.968
No, wait. That's my address. 40…

23:07.052 --> 23:09.763

23:09.846 --> 23:12.933
I saw her get murdered.
Oh! Oh, she's bleeding.

23:13.016 --> 23:15.227
<i>Ma'am, I need you to calm down.</i>

23:15.310 --> 23:18.313
Someone's gotta do something!

25:28.193 --> 25:29.194
