IN THAT CLEANING MIXTURE?

YEAH.

19:53.667 --> 19:54.734
I JUST MADE IT
SUPER STRONG

19:54.734 --> 19:55.934
SO IT WILL WORK
SUPER GOOD.

19:55.934 --> 19:59.100
YEAH, AND NOW MY SUIT
IS SUPER RUINED.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.500
MR. JONES, THE

A FEW ADJUSTMENTS.

I'M SORRY
YOUR OUTFIT DIDN'T
WORK OUT, RAE.

20:15.767 --> 20:16.800

THE PLUS SIDE.

I WONDER HOW
THEY GOT TOGETHER.

20:29.734 --> 20:31.467
GUESS THEY FOUND
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

20:31.467 --> 20:35.667
YEAH. MAYBE IT WAS
LAUGHING AT YOU.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.967
WELL, NOW THAT THEY
FOUND EACH OTHER,

20:36.967 --> 20:39.400
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL
LEAVE ME ALONE.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.967
I HEARD THAT.
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

20:43.667 --> 20:44.467

YOU BELONG TO ME.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.200
MR. JONES
IS A VERY BUSY MAN, OK?

21:37.200 --> 21:39.100
