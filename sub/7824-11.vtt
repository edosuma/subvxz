07:30.230 --> 07:32.470

it's that you'll feel
no pain at all until some time
tomorrow evening

when your heart
suddenly explodes.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.340
Now a little death anxiety
is normal.

07:40.410 --> 07:42.340
You can expect to go through
five stages.

07:42.410 --> 07:43.910
The first is denial.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.610
No way,
because I'm not dying.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.550
Second is anger.

Why, you little..!

07:47.910 --> 07:49.040
Then after that

07:49.110 --> 07:50.370
comes fear.

Bargaining.

Doc, you gotta get me
out of this. I'll make it
worth your while.

Finally, acceptance.

Well, we all got to go sometime.

Mr. Simpson, your progress
astounds me.

I should leave you two alone.

will be helpful.

about what you want

10:03.650 --> 10:05.290
Number one--
Cover for me.

You're going to learn
how to shave.

10:15.330 --> 10:20.900
And finally, the little spot
under your nose.

10:20.970 --> 10:24.040
Next, we take
some toilet paper

10:24.100 --> 10:26.600

teensy little squares

10:26.670 --> 10:30.010

you're bleeding.

10:31.710 --> 10:33.380
There and there. Don't worry.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.250
The blood will hold it
right on your face.

10:35.310 --> 10:38.580
Now... some aftershave.

10:38.650 --> 10:40.590
Oooh! Ahh! Eee! Ahhh!

this infernal racket?

Oh, let me hear you play.

11:06.510 --> 11:07.520
Does a father have to explain?

Maggie, you're grown up now,

you're probably wondering

12:56.050 --> 12:58.180
what kind of man
your father was.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.630
He was a simple man. A kind man.

Never went fishing

"But first,
please heed this call

19:29.150 --> 19:31.720
"That always
will I love you

19:31.780 --> 19:34.380
My one, my love, my all."

19:34.450 --> 19:36.320
That was beautiful.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.490
( <i>kissing )</i>

19:45.730 --> 19:47.200
( <i>sighs )</i>

19:51.370 --> 19:53.140
Good-bye, Maggie.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.470
Stay as sweet as you are.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.250
Good-bye, Lisa.

19:59.310 --> 20:02.180
I know you'll make me proud.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.040
Good-bye, Bart.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.360
I like your sheets.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.060
The good book.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.430
On tape?

20:17.500 --> 20:20.500
Ooh, it's read by Larry King.

20:23.970 --> 20:25.940
<i>Hi, I'm Larry King.</i>

20:26.000 --> 20:28.770
<i>In the beginning, God created
the Heaven and the Earth</i>

20:28.840 --> 20:31.080
<i>and the Earth
was without form...</i>

20:31.140 --> 20:34.680
<i>Alzeah begat Phineas,
Phineas begat Abushua, and...</i>

20:34.750 --> 20:36.120
<i>( tape fast-forwarding )</i>

20:36.180 --> 20:37.850
<i>...begat Ahamas...</i>

20:37.920 --> 20:39.590
<i>( tape fast-forwarding )</i>

20:39.650 --> 20:41.860
<i>...Amariah begat Aerito,
Aerito begat...</i>

20:41.920 --> 20:44.020
<i>( tape fast-forwarding )</i>

20:44.090 --> 20:46.360
<i>...Shalam begat Hilchia...</i>

20:46.420 --> 20:48.490
<i>...and he shall turn the heart
of the fathers to the children</i>

20:48.560 --> 20:50.400
<i>and the heart of the children
to their fathers</i>

20:50.460 --> 20:53.170
<i>lest I come and smite the Earth
with a curse.</i>

20:53.230 --> 20:54.430
<i>Well, that's it.</i>

20:54.500 --> 20:55.870
<i>My old friend Duke Seaver's
standing by.</i>

20:55.930 --> 20:57.090
<i>We'll get some coffee.</i>

20:57.170 --> 20:59.370
<i>We'll get some matzo ball soup.</i>

20:59.440 --> 21:01.310
<i>I love the San Antonio Spurs,
by the way. If you're betting
in the N.B.A. this year,</i>

21:01.370 --> 21:03.430
<i>I think they're gonna
win it all.</i>

21:03.510 --> 21:06.880
<i>So I guess there's
nothing more to say but...
( tape stops abruptly )</i>

21:15.490 --> 21:16.690
Homer?

21:16.750 --> 21:17.610
( <i>gasps )</i>

21:17.690 --> 21:18.890
Homer?

21:22.490 --> 21:23.720
( <i>gasps )</i>

21:23.790 --> 21:25.720
Oh, Homer...

21:25.800 --> 21:29.400
Homer...

21:29.470 --> 21:30.740
Hmm...

21:30.800 --> 21:33.840
His drool-- it's warm.

21:36.140 --> 21:37.410
He's alive!

21:37.480 --> 21:39.710
Homer! Homer, wake up!

21:39.780 --> 21:41.080
You're alive!

21:41.150 --> 21:42.420
Marge, stop it.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.850
You're alive!

21:43.920 --> 21:45.420
What are you
talking about?

21:45.480 --> 21:46.680
You're alive!

21:46.750 --> 21:47.920
I'm alive!

21:47.990 --> 21:50.960
I'm alive,
and I couldn't be happier!

21:51.020 --> 21:52.830
<i>From this day forward</i>

21:52.890 --> 21:55.500
<i>I vow to live life
to its fullest.</i>

21:59.400 --> 22:00.270
Bowling commentator:
Strike!

22:00.330 --> 22:02.570
That's three in a row.

22:02.630 --> 22:04.330
Let's see
that one again.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.910
Yeah, here we go.

22:05.970 --> 22:07.670
Note the excellent
wrist action.

22:07.740 --> 22:09.210
It's just about to go
into the gutter

22:09.270 --> 22:11.470
and then a nice spin.

22:20.650 --> 22:22.160
Ouch! A split.

22:22.220 --> 22:25.130
If he makes this,
he'll be down by 40 pins.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.490
This match, though,
is far from over.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.530
It is far from over

22:29.590 --> 22:32.520
but his approach has been
wrong from the beginning
as far as I'm concerned,

22:32.600 --> 22:34.200
He's an erratic bowler, Jim.
He tends to explode

22:34.270 --> 22:36.870
in the seven, eight,
nine frames...
