WEBVTT

00:00.406 --> 00:03.256
Hey, I know you've got
a million things going on,

00:03.281 --> 00:05.159
but this is just a gentle reminder

00:05.183 --> 00:07.881
to email the invites to
Emily's baby shower.

00:07.906 --> 00:09.296
Something like,

00:09.321 --> 00:12.045
"Please come to Emily's baby party,
where there will be baby things"?

00:12.070 --> 00:14.318
- Something like that?
- <i>It's tricky.</i>

00:14.343 --> 00:16.435
Emily doesn't really like baby showers,

00:16.460 --> 00:19.494
so she doesn't want it to look or feel

00:19.518 --> 00:22.101
or sound like a baby shower,

00:22.126 --> 00:24.576
<i>so, no... no storks on anything, 'kay?</i>

00:24.601 --> 00:26.365
Got it. Ix-nay on the orks-stay.

00:26.390 --> 00:28.069
<i>And no baby animals.</i>

00:28.093 --> 00:31.739
And are you coming with us
to Dr. Hamara's today still?

00:31.763 --> 00:34.075
Of course. I gotta meet
this Howie you guys keep talking about.

00:34.099 --> 00:35.453
Wait a...

00:35.478 --> 00:38.145
- What the?
- It is not exactly what I expected,

00:38.170 --> 00:40.481
but I'm rolling with it.

00:40.505 --> 00:42.679
All right, you don't have
to look so surprised.

00:42.704 --> 00:44.859
It's just a simple sleight of hand, bud.

00:48.514 --> 00:51.024
You really missed out on
Movie Night last night.

00:51.049 --> 00:54.343
I am doing a whole deep dive
into the Jim Carrey oeuvre.

00:54.368 --> 00:56.865
I'm halfway through the
high-concept comedy phase,

00:56.890 --> 00:59.634
slowly working my way towards
serious-artist territory.

00:59.658 --> 01:01.303
Which movie are you on now?

01:01.328 --> 01:04.105
The eternal classic
that is "Liar, Liar."

01:04.129 --> 01:05.429
Oh. Well,

01:05.453 --> 01:06.975
maybe when you get past his blue period

01:06.999 --> 01:09.110
and he returns to his roots with
"Dumb and Dumber To,"

01:09.134 --> 01:10.878
I'll be ready for Movie Night.

01:11.706 --> 01:13.114
FYI, this isn't my fault

01:13.138 --> 01:15.437
just because I wrote the
entire calendar code.

01:15.462 --> 01:18.703
What's not your fault that
really sounds like your fault?

01:18.728 --> 01:20.787
The bug in the Sprq Watch.
It's causing every event

01:20.812 --> 01:23.117
that someone creates to
be posted on December 25.

01:23.142 --> 01:24.982
Christmas? That's weird.

01:25.007 --> 01:26.226
Have no fear.

01:26.251 --> 01:27.602
After talking to my boy Leif and doing

01:27.626 --> 01:28.790
some mad intense soul-searching,

01:28.814 --> 01:30.964
I am now new and improved Tobin 2.0,

01:30.989 --> 01:33.389
hardworking, committed, serious.

01:33.414 --> 01:34.969
Watch how fast I nail this.

01:34.993 --> 01:37.705
Speaking of nailing...
Nope, not gonna make the joke.

01:37.729 --> 01:39.859
Not gonna do it. Tobin, stay focused.

01:41.007 --> 01:42.468
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

01:42.492 --> 01:44.055
I can't believe these words
are coming out of my mouth.

01:44.079 --> 01:45.478
Uh-huh.

01:48.466 --> 01:50.183
I saw Joan and Leif kissing.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.029
What? Like, kissing kissing?

01:53.054 --> 01:55.209
Yes. And not only that,

01:55.234 --> 01:57.392
I heard him sing "I Put a Spell on You."

01:57.416 --> 01:59.404
Seemed real sketchy.

01:59.429 --> 02:00.811
Leif is definitely up to something.

02:00.835 --> 02:02.397
Are we talking like witchcraft

02:02.421 --> 02:04.343
or just shameless career advancement?

02:04.368 --> 02:05.699
Either way, hooking up with Leif

02:05.724 --> 02:07.820
is like kissing a Slytherin.

02:07.845 --> 02:10.413
Zoey, can we see you in
here for a minute, please?

02:11.196 --> 02:12.320
- "We"?
- "We"?

02:12.345 --> 02:14.941
So Danny Michael Davis
is coming to town today,

02:14.966 --> 02:17.578
and he wants to hear
our pitch for The Chirp.

02:17.602 --> 02:20.420
Today? Like, actual today?

02:20.445 --> 02:22.849
Surprised me, too,
but when the CEO of our company

02:22.874 --> 02:25.170
says he wants a meeting today,
we give him today.

02:25.195 --> 02:26.646
- Okay, but...
- This is our chance

02:26.671 --> 02:28.023
to show him what we can do.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.679
But can we do?

02:29.704 --> 02:31.921
- I mean, do we have enough to show him?
- We better.

02:31.946 --> 02:33.460
The Chirp is a wonderful product,

02:33.485 --> 02:34.695
and Joan deserves to be rewarded

02:34.719 --> 02:36.264
for all her hard work and dedication.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.765
Take it down, like 80%.

02:37.789 --> 02:41.069
So, uh, what do we have to
do to give Danny a timeline

02:41.093 --> 02:44.344
showing him that we can have
The Chirp ready in six months?

02:45.664 --> 02:48.376
Um, I could do more like nine.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.593
I'm hearing six.

02:49.618 --> 02:52.138
- I just think that...
- Six.

02:52.163 --> 02:54.454
- I could...
- I would like to hear six months.

02:55.251 --> 02:56.528
Six months, it is.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.019
Great. Thank you.

02:59.298 --> 03:02.266
Zoey! Tech bloggers are
starting to reach out to me

03:02.291 --> 03:04.750
for comments on the watch.
Any estimates on a fix?

03:04.775 --> 03:06.188
What? No, not yet.

03:06.213 --> 03:08.105
Um, Tobin's working on it.

03:08.130 --> 03:09.985
Great. I-I'm gonna make some calls.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.711
- Wait, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

03:12.736 --> 03:15.454
We are pitching Danny
Michael Davis today.

03:15.479 --> 03:16.923
- Ah.
- You know him, right?

03:16.948 --> 03:19.283
Kind of. He helped me get this job

03:19.308 --> 03:21.420
after we snuck out of the
same boring tech panel

03:21.444 --> 03:23.688
and ended up hiding in
the hotel bar together.

03:23.842 --> 03:25.856
Oh, so you do know him better than me.

03:25.881 --> 03:27.540
The man's never here,
and when he does show up,

03:27.564 --> 03:30.477
he's surrounded by a force field
of nervous execs at all times.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.930
Well, he's definitely intense,
and he operates

03:32.955 --> 03:35.222
at a whole different
frequency than the rest of us.

03:37.159 --> 03:39.680
Look, if you're feeling overwhelmed,

03:39.705 --> 03:43.977
try being still and taking
10 long, deep breaths.

03:44.299 --> 03:46.444
It's part of this new
meditation technique I'm doing.

03:46.469 --> 03:48.779
Hmm. You got a technique?

03:48.804 --> 03:51.597
I do now. Just trying
to keep things calm up here.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.858
- Know what I mean?
- I don't know what you mean.

03:53.883 --> 03:55.821
I've got a super-chill brain

03:55.845 --> 03:58.289
that never needs calming, so...

03:58.866 --> 04:00.344
- Lucky you.
- Yeah, well, it's cool

04:00.369 --> 04:02.453
that you're working on yourself, though.
Is it helping?

04:02.477 --> 04:03.782
I'm not sure yet.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.665
- _
- What's wrong?

04:06.689 --> 04:08.139
Bad timing.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.758
I've got all this work to do,

04:09.783 --> 04:11.658
and I have to go to my
father's doctor's appointment,

04:11.682 --> 04:13.267
which, according to my Sprq Point Watch,

04:13.291 --> 04:16.072
is now scheduled for Christmas Day.

04:16.226 --> 04:18.225
Ah. Everything okay
with your dad, though?

04:18.250 --> 04:19.805
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

04:20.976 --> 04:24.016
If he gets his back brace off,
he's gonna be really happy.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.061
All right.

04:25.086 --> 04:26.485
Well, tell him Merry Christmas.

04:26.836 --> 04:28.110
Thanks.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.946
The next thing I know,
people are screaming.

04:30.971 --> 04:35.282
I am going blind, and the guy
takes off with all my money.

04:35.307 --> 04:37.766
- Oh, God.
- So, bottom line is,

04:37.791 --> 04:39.869
never rub your eyes when
you're in the middle

04:39.894 --> 04:42.073
of a ghost-pepper-eating competition.

04:42.098 --> 04:44.243
I concur with that statement.

04:44.268 --> 04:46.883
Would you mind giving me a few
minutes alone with the family?

04:46.908 --> 04:48.085
No problem, Doc.

04:48.110 --> 04:49.844
Uh, but try and keep it short,

04:49.869 --> 04:51.747
'cause Mitch and I have a lot of plans.

04:51.772 --> 04:54.289
We've got go-carts. We've got UFC fight,

04:54.314 --> 04:56.266
maybe a pub crawl later.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.502
- Nice to meet you, Zoey.
- You, too, Howie.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.024
Why don't we all have a seat?

05:11.775 --> 05:13.993
So here's where we're at, my friend.

05:14.327 --> 05:17.180
Your medication is no longer stopping

05:17.205 --> 05:19.272
the progression of the disease,

05:20.212 --> 05:22.612
which we all knew was a possibility.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.296
I don't understand. Are you sure?

05:28.321 --> 05:31.649
In the last week, he...
He's been... he really...

05:31.674 --> 05:33.914
I've been investigating, uh, studies

05:33.939 --> 05:35.908
with these experimental drugs online,
so maybe we could...

05:35.932 --> 05:38.071
I wish there was
something more we could do,

05:38.096 --> 05:42.131
but I'm afraid we're entering
the final stages of the disease.

05:42.897 --> 05:45.461
No, that can't be right.

05:45.486 --> 05:47.598
I mean, it's not his time.

05:47.623 --> 05:49.101
We're clearly not there yet.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.335
That... that's true. I actually...

05:51.360 --> 05:52.838
I know this is hard to hear, but...

06:41.746 --> 06:43.336
Ma'am, are you okay?

Someone making you... crazy?

08:43.429 --> 08:45.032
Was I just singing out loud?

08:45.571 --> 08:47.563
Um, yeah.

08:47.588 --> 08:48.588
Oh.

08:48.613 --> 08:50.057
Like alone or with dancers?

08:50.082 --> 08:53.438
Alone. I-I don't see any dancers.

08:53.463 --> 08:55.207
That's really weird.

08:55.232 --> 08:57.461
I thou... I thought there was dancers.

09:00.066 --> 09:02.086
Do you think something's
weird with my powers?

09:02.111 --> 09:04.795
Well, I'm no expert, but it seems like

09:04.820 --> 09:06.875
they're making you crazy as...

09:07.266 --> 09:10.375
Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie
www.addic7ed.com

09:12.315 --> 09:14.063
Am I going crazy? I feel like I am.

09:14.088 --> 09:16.437
I mean, I don't know
what crazy feels like,

09:16.462 --> 09:17.805
but I... I feel like this is it.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.174
Okay, before you totally freak out,

09:19.198 --> 09:21.438
just remember a lot of
people sing out loud...

09:21.463 --> 09:24.196
Small children,
waiters on your birthday,

09:24.221 --> 09:26.680
me every time I hear that song
"Africa" on the radio.

09:26.705 --> 09:28.064
I didn't even realize I was doing it.

09:28.088 --> 09:29.805
I thought it was
happening inside my mind,

09:29.830 --> 09:31.782
but apparently I was for
real singing and dancing

09:31.807 --> 09:34.329
throughout the entire
lobby of our building.

09:34.354 --> 09:36.165
That's bad.

09:36.350 --> 09:39.079
Okay, so, look, normally your powers...

09:39.104 --> 09:40.954
Which is still very
weird for me to say...

09:40.979 --> 09:42.344
Let you hear other people's songs,

09:42.369 --> 09:43.736
but now it sounds
like it's the opposite,

09:43.760 --> 09:46.743
- which is very confusing.
- It is very confusing.

09:46.768 --> 09:48.126
Okay, what song were you singing again?

09:48.150 --> 09:50.618
"Crazy," which I guess makes sense,

09:50.643 --> 09:53.383
because that is clearly what
today is turning out to be.

09:53.408 --> 09:54.681
Right, because Danny Michael Davis

09:54.705 --> 09:56.710
just decided to drop in unannounced.

09:57.071 --> 09:58.499
Yeah.

09:58.524 --> 10:03.218
Uh, our CEO just showing up
without notice,

10:03.242 --> 10:05.279
so crazy.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.905
Well, maybe it's just a one-time thing.

10:06.930 --> 10:08.929
I mean, I honestly wouldn't
worry too much about it.

10:08.953 --> 10:11.624
I really have to take this.

10:11.649 --> 10:12.795
Okay.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.217
Hello,

10:14.242 --> 10:16.608
Are you okay? Because
you left so quickly,

10:16.633 --> 10:18.483
and we didn't get a chance to talk.

10:18.508 --> 10:20.749
I'm sorry. I just really
needed to get to work,

10:20.774 --> 10:22.256
but I'm fine. Are you fine?

10:22.281 --> 10:23.609
I mean, I know you're not fine, but...

10:23.633 --> 10:25.484
I'm just trying...

10:25.844 --> 10:28.241
not to cry in front of him, you know?

10:28.266 --> 10:29.266
<i>Nor should you.</i>

10:29.291 --> 10:30.962
Doctors always want to
give worst-case scenarios.

10:30.986 --> 10:32.937
I'm sure there's plenty more we can do.

10:32.962 --> 10:34.914
Well, I don't know about that, Zoey.

10:34.939 --> 10:38.070
Um, Dr. Hamara was very definitive,

10:38.095 --> 10:43.148
but we all knew that this day
was gonna come at some point.

10:43.173 --> 10:44.867
Here. Talk to your brother.

10:44.892 --> 10:46.562
Tobin, how we looking?

10:46.587 --> 10:48.547
<i>Okay, so, uh, Dad wants to have</i>

10:48.572 --> 10:51.251
a family meeting tonight, uh, just...

10:51.276 --> 10:53.586
There's some things
to talk about and, um,

10:53.611 --> 10:56.453
you know, his wishes for how
to proceed with things and...

10:56.478 --> 10:58.195
Proceed with things?

10:58.220 --> 11:00.360
Like, medical interventions he'd want,
ones he wouldn't,

11:00.384 --> 11:02.055
and, um, I mean, I know it's tough,

11:02.080 --> 11:03.875
but we need to talk about it, so...

11:03.900 --> 11:05.243
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. No, I understand.

11:05.267 --> 11:07.735
It's just, uh, our CEO
is coming in today,

11:07.760 --> 11:10.173
and I'm not sure how late it might go,

11:10.198 --> 11:12.243
so if I end up not making it tonight,

11:12.268 --> 11:13.673
maybe you can fill me in later.

11:13.698 --> 11:15.048
Sure. Uh...

11:15.073 --> 11:16.484
Love you, bro.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.626
"Bro"?

11:18.651 --> 11:21.572
- So where are we?
- We are almost done.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.479
Just gotta switch these
two parts in the intro,

11:23.504 --> 11:25.902
which will lead directly into
you demonstrating the prototype.

11:25.926 --> 11:29.299
Right. So I will talk about The Chirp

11:29.324 --> 11:31.536
and describe what it does,
talk about how great it is...

11:31.561 --> 11:32.916
How great we are.

11:32.941 --> 11:35.658
And then I'll do, like,
a little demonstration.

11:35.683 --> 11:37.932
And then they will loudly
"Chirp" their appreciation.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.737
Danny will probably call you a
"Chirp" off the old block.

11:40.761 --> 11:43.135
We'll go to a reception and have
some "Chirps" and dip.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.520
Think you mean "Chirp" and "dirp."

11:47.437 --> 11:49.248
And then Zoey will chime in

11:49.273 --> 11:51.408
with her beautiful keynotes,

11:51.433 --> 11:53.411
and let's see your work on the timeline.

11:53.436 --> 11:55.760
- Oh, this? Um...
- Can I see your keynote?

11:55.785 --> 11:57.463
- This was...
- Yeah.

11:57.488 --> 12:00.834
Really just for me,
but it's just a starting off.

12:00.859 --> 12:01.859
- Well.
- Oh.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.760
- Wow.
- Um, ookay.

12:04.785 --> 12:06.100
- Can you read that?
- No, I actually...

12:06.124 --> 12:08.102
Is this like a Rorschach test? Wow.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.209
- You... you read it.
- No, no, I can't.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.302
- You try to read it.
- No, you go. You go.

12:12.844 --> 12:14.169

12:15.634 --> 12:17.099

What?

13:35.357 --> 13:36.865
Are you high?

13:36.890 --> 13:40.662
Just high on life
and this fantastic presentation.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.031
Whoo!

13:42.249 --> 13:43.490
Oh, you know, um,

13:43.515 --> 13:46.494
uh, it's just how a song
gets stuck in your head

13:46.519 --> 13:49.798
and, you know, the calendar
thing with the Sprq Point Watch,

13:49.823 --> 13:52.635
um, turning everything into Christmas.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.622
Um, that's why I was singing the song,

13:55.647 --> 13:57.443
because of the watch and...

13:57.896 --> 13:59.208
because of Christmas.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.615
Do you understand how
important this pitch is?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.826
- Totally.
- Listen...

14:03.851 --> 14:05.014
do you need to go to the hospital?

14:05.038 --> 14:06.038
Oh, no, I don't think so.

14:06.063 --> 14:08.396
Okay. Then this is not the day

14:08.421 --> 14:10.466
for any Zoey shenanigans.

14:10.491 --> 14:12.037
Couldn't agree with you more.

14:12.062 --> 14:14.606
So, um, do I normally
have Zoey shenanigans?

14:14.631 --> 14:16.560
Can you schedule your nervous
breakdown for another day?

14:16.584 --> 14:19.223
- Yep, consider it rescheduled.
- Thanks.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.106
Jesus.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.536
Okay, so it's officially
not a one-time thing.

14:30.561 --> 14:33.089
I just sang out loud for a second time

14:33.114 --> 14:34.551
to Joan and Leif,
who now think I'm on drugs.

14:34.575 --> 14:36.433
- Well, are you?
- What?

14:36.458 --> 14:37.810
- All right. I'm just asking.
- Here's the worst part,

14:37.834 --> 14:39.550
I couldn't stop it from happening.

14:39.575 --> 14:41.314
Who knows what song I might sing next

14:41.338 --> 14:44.192
and what corresponding dance
moves might go along with it?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.043
Oh, what's that?
Are you guys talking about

14:46.068 --> 14:49.253
how Tobin fixed the glitch?
'Cause I did it, son.

14:49.278 --> 14:50.390
- Boom.
- Good.

14:50.414 --> 14:51.560
That's great. Thank you, Tobin.

14:51.584 --> 14:54.332
However, much like in life,
in solving one problem,

14:54.357 --> 14:55.501
I've now created another.

14:55.525 --> 14:57.653
July 4th is no longer on July 4th.

14:57.678 --> 14:59.556
It's complicated, but I'm on it.

14:59.581 --> 15:02.015
I'm in it. Do not be afraid.

15:04.274 --> 15:06.137
Look, maybe you're just stressed out

15:06.162 --> 15:08.262
and stress is what's causing
your powers to glitch.

15:08.287 --> 15:09.809
We just... we need to figure out why.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.278
Okay, well, uh,

15:11.303 --> 15:13.756
normally when I hear
someone sing to me,

15:14.145 --> 15:15.334
I try to help them with something

15:15.358 --> 15:16.856
that's going on in their life, so...

15:16.881 --> 15:19.482
Okay, so, maybe
you need to help yourself.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.622
And how do I do that?
Because helping myself

15:23.647 --> 15:26.137
would mean taking a
vacation from Sprq Point

15:26.162 --> 15:29.333
or curing my father's disease,
and both of those

15:29.358 --> 15:32.114
seem like problems I can't
exactly solve right now.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.348
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

15:34.590 --> 15:35.981
How was the doctor's office?

15:36.006 --> 15:39.348
Uh, same old, same old, you know?

15:39.373 --> 15:40.374
"Open your mouth."

15:40.398 --> 15:42.676
"Here's a lollipop." Blah-blah-blah.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.848
Zoey, Danny's here.

15:45.873 --> 15:46.874
His helicopter just landed.

15:46.898 --> 15:48.130
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.632
No! I need more time.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.232
I have no idea how to make
these numbers work yet.

15:51.256 --> 15:53.083
Well, let me try to stall him for a bit,

15:53.108 --> 15:54.810
maybe give him a tour of
the new rooftop garden.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.364
- You would do that for me?
- Sure.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.887
And if that doesn't help,
I'll pull the fire alarm.

16:00.114 --> 16:01.380
Bless you.

16:11.356 --> 16:12.591
Ho ho ho.

16:12.616 --> 16:14.747
- Merry Christmas.
- Leif, please don't bother me.

16:14.772 --> 16:17.880
- I'm trying to finish this.
- No, this will only take a moment.

16:17.905 --> 16:22.169
I'm just so curious about that song

16:22.194 --> 16:24.950
you sang to me and Joan earlier,
'cause, you know,

16:24.975 --> 16:26.200
um, it didn't really seem

16:26.225 --> 16:28.526
like a song that just
got stuck in your head.

16:28.551 --> 16:32.130
It seemed more like, I don't know,
like a-an accusation.

16:32.155 --> 16:35.512
Like maybe you heard
something or saw something

16:35.537 --> 16:39.341
where someone was doing
something with someone.

16:39.591 --> 16:40.808
Fine. I saw you and Joan

16:40.833 --> 16:42.473
making out in
the conference room. Happy?

16:45.695 --> 16:47.364
- I knew it.
- And truthfully,

16:47.389 --> 16:49.559
I think you're up to something,
and I don't like it.

16:49.584 --> 16:50.809
Up to what?

16:50.841 --> 16:53.044
Up to cherishing an incredible woman?

16:53.069 --> 16:54.637
Showering her with all the affection

16:54.662 --> 16:56.654
and attention she so clearly deserves?

16:56.679 --> 16:58.824
I am nauseous,
and I still don't believe you.

16:58.848 --> 17:00.153
You don't have to believe me.

17:00.178 --> 17:02.278
Some people don't
believe in Santa Claus.

17:02.643 --> 17:04.919
It doesn't stop the magic of Christmas

17:04.944 --> 17:06.536
from entering their hearts.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.294
What are you talking about?

17:09.319 --> 17:11.325
Danny is gonna be here
any minute, and I...

17:11.349 --> 17:12.558
_

17:12.583 --> 17:14.528
Danny Michael Davis is here!

17:14.553 --> 17:16.637
Danny Michael Davis is here.

17:16.662 --> 17:18.941
Danny Michael Davis is here.

17:18.965 --> 17:21.579
- Great.
- Great.

17:24.381 --> 17:26.239
Yeah, no, I don't shake hands.

17:26.263 --> 17:28.497
Are you Joan? J-Joan?

17:28.521 --> 17:29.716
So good to see you again.

17:29.741 --> 17:31.919
- You, too.
- Joan, look at this carrot.

17:31.944 --> 17:34.522
This is fresh from the roof.
I just picked it myself.

17:34.547 --> 17:36.127
- Can you believe that?
- Wow.

17:36.152 --> 17:37.365
You know what? Maybe
we should whip this up

17:37.389 --> 17:38.887
into a smoothie. What do you think?

17:38.912 --> 17:40.692
Actually, no,
we should probably save it.

17:40.717 --> 17:43.034
No, let's whip it up into a smoothie.
Thanks, Tony.

17:43.059 --> 17:44.191
Tony works out.

17:44.794 --> 17:46.997
Oh, it's nice to be back at Sprq Point.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.173
You know, your first
company is like your first child.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.158
You just love it way more
than all the other ones.

17:52.048 --> 17:54.575
So, is everyone
still loving my cereal bar?

17:54.600 --> 17:56.409
That was my original
workplace innovation, you know?

17:56.433 --> 17:58.011
Loving it. Love it, right?

17:59.709 --> 18:01.145
Though sometimes we switch it up.

18:01.170 --> 18:04.778
We've had taco bar,
salad bar, bread bar.

18:04.803 --> 18:06.147
Bread bar?

18:06.432 --> 18:07.558
I don't eat bread.

18:07.583 --> 18:08.883
No one does.

18:10.353 --> 18:11.958
I do. I love bread.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.553
- All right, let's do this.
- Okay.

18:15.618 --> 18:18.247
Social anxiety has never been higher.

18:18.272 --> 18:21.637
We need a greater sense of
connectivity to our fellow man.

18:21.662 --> 18:23.114
That's where The Chirp comes in.

18:23.139 --> 18:25.981
Look, stuff in this vein already exists,

18:26.006 --> 18:28.653
so I'm gonna ask you what
is different about this.

18:28.678 --> 18:30.153
The technology of The Chirp

18:30.178 --> 18:31.786
is distinctive, and
I think once you hear

18:31.811 --> 18:33.076
- the whole presentat...
- Can someone bring me a...

18:33.100 --> 18:35.614
- a metal straw?
- Oh, so sorry about that.

18:35.639 --> 18:37.676
- Yeah. The environment.
- Uh...

18:37.701 --> 18:38.740
How long would it take to build?

18:38.764 --> 18:40.809
Well, with all the
information you'll ever need

18:40.834 --> 18:43.051
about the timeline,
I give you Zoey. Zoey.

18:44.429 --> 18:46.044
Um...

18:49.725 --> 18:51.380
Um...

18:53.629 --> 18:56.216
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, not now.

20:51.514 --> 20:53.419
I don't... I don't understand.

20:54.135 --> 20:56.880
No, no, no, it's... it's not the end.

20:56.905 --> 21:00.718
See, The Chirp helps
relieve the pressure,

21:00.743 --> 21:04.192
get it, of awkward situations,
like this one.

21:04.217 --> 21:09.365
Ha. The... The Chirp
is the duetting partner

21:09.390 --> 21:12.035
you've always wanted,
but didn't know you needed.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.981
It's there to help you and
back you up in any situation.

21:15.006 --> 21:17.915
Yeah. See, someone like Zoey here

21:17.940 --> 21:20.067
may not know what to do or say

21:20.092 --> 21:23.458
at a party or an interview
or a big presentation...

21:23.483 --> 21:25.903
- He's not wrong.
- But with The Chirp

21:25.928 --> 21:27.762
chirping everything you need to know

21:27.787 --> 21:30.194
about everything into your ear,

21:30.219 --> 21:31.834
you will never be at
a loss for words again.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.021
- Great. Thank you, guys...
- Great. Yep.

21:33.045 --> 21:34.239
- So much.
- We're done.

21:34.264 --> 21:36.293
Well, we will email you

21:36.318 --> 21:39.106
the rest of the fantastic proposal.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.028
Okay, yep, that's fine.
Um, what are you...

21:41.053 --> 21:43.354
What is... I didn't...
Did I ask for this?

21:46.065 --> 21:47.985
I'm just kidding.
I already finished my smoothie.

21:49.967 --> 21:51.490
All right, I'm gonna
go pick some more carrots

21:51.514 --> 21:53.981
to, uh, bring to my biological parents.

21:54.746 --> 21:55.763
All right, let's go.

21:55.788 --> 21:57.918
- Wow.
- Okay.

21:57.943 --> 22:00.004
Uh, Danny, uh...

22:01.550 --> 22:03.434
Danny, just one second.

22:12.825 --> 22:15.272
I'm sorry I ever doubted
your whole powers thing

22:15.296 --> 22:17.374
or whatever this is, because no person

22:17.398 --> 22:19.950
could ever make up what
just happened in that room.

22:19.975 --> 22:22.224
How mad is Joan gonna be?

22:22.249 --> 22:24.121
I don't know,
but I'm guessing about as mad

22:24.146 --> 22:26.282
as the time Tobin brought
a squirrel to work.

22:26.307 --> 22:28.251
It was a ferret, bro.

22:28.275 --> 22:29.653
This is terrible.

22:29.825 --> 22:31.488
If I don't find a way to stop singing,

22:31.512 --> 22:33.423
things are gonna get real bad.

22:33.447 --> 22:35.392
Get real bad?

22:35.416 --> 22:36.893
Okay, let's just work through this thing

22:36.917 --> 22:39.285
like we're debugging a program,
line by line.

22:39.310 --> 22:41.768
What makes this day
different from any other?

22:41.793 --> 22:44.809
I am constantly humiliating
myself through song.

22:44.834 --> 22:46.745
Okay, sure, but starting when?

22:46.770 --> 22:48.300
This morning.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.331
When this morning?

22:49.356 --> 22:50.640
On the way back

22:50.664 --> 22:52.442
from my father's doctor's appointment.

22:52.466 --> 22:55.362
Okay. Did something happen there?

22:55.387 --> 22:57.059
Nothing worth talking about.

23:01.575 --> 23:04.317
What really matters is
you saved me in there.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.276
So whatever happens, whether I get fired

23:07.301 --> 23:09.442
or killed by Joan,

23:10.059 --> 23:11.432
you're a very good friend.

23:11.457 --> 23:12.716
You're just lucky I grew up with

23:12.740 --> 23:15.098
"Billy Joel's Greatest Hits,
Volumes One and Two."

23:15.123 --> 23:17.833
It's kind of a rite of passage
for every East Coast Jewish boy,

23:17.858 --> 23:21.538
like going to summer camp and
not playing for the Knicks.

23:21.562 --> 23:22.729
Still.

23:24.466 --> 23:27.090
No one else would have
done that for me, and...

23:28.642 --> 23:31.146
I guess the thing is...

23:31.171 --> 23:34.884
♪ Well, you done done me,
and you bet I felt it ♪

23:34.909 --> 23:38.087

24:38.855 --> 24:42.191
Um, you just sang me a song.

24:45.379 --> 24:47.042
I...

24:47.481 --> 24:50.927
I don't know why that happened.

24:50.952 --> 24:52.127
I do.

24:52.152 --> 24:53.986
This is your inner truth, right?

24:54.011 --> 24:55.465
Isn't that what this
whole thing is about?

24:55.489 --> 24:57.600
Uh-huh, yes,
but I don't know if that song

24:57.624 --> 24:59.293
is saying exactly what
we think it's saying.

24:59.317 --> 25:03.681
Maybe I'm feeling like
you're always there for me

25:03.706 --> 25:07.610
and I want to be there for you, too.

25:07.634 --> 25:11.144
You know, like, I'm yours,

25:11.169 --> 25:14.308
dot, dot, dot, if you need me. Does...

25:15.192 --> 25:17.170
that make sense?

25:17.195 --> 25:18.821
Mm, no.

25:18.846 --> 25:21.458
I think it's pretty
clear what it was saying.

25:21.482 --> 25:22.720
- You sure?
- Yeah, pre...

25:22.745 --> 25:24.060
- How clear?
- Uh, crystal.

25:24.084 --> 25:26.097
Joan would like to see
both of you right away.

25:26.122 --> 25:27.830
It's probably nothing to worry about,

25:27.855 --> 25:30.136
unless you're worried
about getting fired or...

25:34.030 --> 25:36.745
I'm sorry about all of this.

25:36.997 --> 25:38.495
I'm not.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.816
Whatever happens, I mean,
it's totally worth it.

25:42.754 --> 25:44.556
Why are you smiling? Huh?

25:44.581 --> 25:45.706
This is not a happy day.

25:45.731 --> 25:47.309
This is not a happy
day where people smile,

25:47.333 --> 25:48.848
like your birthday or your wedding day.

25:48.872 --> 25:50.379
Not my wedding day, but most people's.

25:50.403 --> 25:52.154
Okay, yes,
I'll admit I'm in a good mood,

25:52.179 --> 25:54.001
but it's for completely
unrelated reasons.

25:54.026 --> 25:55.191
Why in the world would the two of you

25:55.215 --> 25:57.961
go rogue like that in front
of Danny Michael Davis?

25:57.985 --> 26:00.017
He just texted me saying he needs space

26:00.042 --> 26:01.222
to think things through.

26:01.247 --> 26:03.292
That's what I say when I'm
about to fire somebody.

26:03.317 --> 26:04.714
Joan, I am very sorry.

26:04.739 --> 26:06.469
I don't know if I can
ever trust you guys again.

26:06.493 --> 26:08.251
And now you have me raising my voice.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.440
You have me raising my voice
like I am a mom at a Target

26:10.464 --> 26:12.642
who's telling the kids we don't
have time to look at the toys,

26:12.666 --> 26:14.908
and that's not who I am.
I've never even been to Target.

26:14.933 --> 26:16.145
Hey, guys.

26:16.737 --> 26:19.350
Zoey, uh, we got a situation
with the Sprq Watch.

26:20.209 --> 26:22.287
I don't want to say what
it is in front of Joan.

26:22.312 --> 26:24.219
All of you, get out. Fix it. Fix it.

26:24.244 --> 26:26.189
Okay, so here's the dillio.

26:26.213 --> 26:28.525
We fixed all the holiday
switch-a-roos on the watch.

26:28.549 --> 26:29.646
- That's good.
- Yeah, but now

26:29.670 --> 26:30.727
there are these "reports"

26:30.751 --> 26:32.397
of the watch sharing calendar events

26:32.422 --> 26:34.147
with everyone on your contact list.

26:34.172 --> 26:36.031
For example, I can see on my watch

26:36.056 --> 26:38.034
that Max has an appointment on Saturday

26:38.058 --> 26:40.537
for something called
"Judo with Sensei Don."

26:40.561 --> 26:42.309
I'm honestly lucky he fit me in.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.426
Okay, this is getting worse
by the second.

26:44.451 --> 26:46.926
Please get it under control ASAP.
Max, can you help?

26:46.951 --> 26:49.139
Yes, whatever you need me to do...

26:49.164 --> 26:50.312
I'm yours.

26:55.967 --> 26:57.678
_

27:04.897 --> 27:06.546
One...

27:07.709 --> 27:09.506
two,

27:10.388 --> 27:11.388
three...

27:11.413 --> 27:12.752
- Whoa.
- Ahh!

27:14.078 --> 27:16.928
- Hi.
- Look at you.

27:16.953 --> 27:18.273
You're trying my new
breathing technique.

27:18.297 --> 27:19.483
Give it time. It helps.

27:19.508 --> 27:21.693
Um, are you...

27:22.200 --> 27:26.193
hiding from the great
calendar crisis of 2020?

27:26.218 --> 27:28.358
I'm actually meditating
in the meditation room.

27:28.383 --> 27:30.826
Healthy body, healthy mind.

27:30.851 --> 27:33.116
Ah, that makes sense to me.

27:33.834 --> 27:37.535
I just needed a break.

27:38.745 --> 27:40.975
Fair warning, I might
just stay in here forever.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.365
I don't blame you.

27:42.390 --> 27:44.350
It's actually my new favorite place.

27:47.015 --> 27:50.160
You know, if we're really quiet,
maybe no one will ever find us.

27:53.982 --> 27:55.967
No. No, no, no.

27:56.514 --> 27:57.514
You okay?

27:57.539 --> 27:59.789
Uh...

28:01.592 --> 28:02.678
I apologize in advance

28:02.703 --> 28:04.194
for whatever is about
to come out of my mouth.

- Oh.
- Max?

29:20.929 --> 29:22.277
I had a programming question,

29:22.302 --> 29:24.756
but I-I didn't want to
interrupt your song, so...

29:24.781 --> 29:26.291
Max, wait. Just...

29:26.316 --> 29:28.083
- Yeah.
- Damn it.

29:30.909 --> 29:33.731
Uh, I...

29:33.756 --> 29:36.135
I'm really sorry. Just know it's not me.

29:36.159 --> 29:37.958
It's my body.

29:41.626 --> 29:42.926
Huh.

29:46.851 --> 29:49.163
Hey, can we talk about this?

29:49.187 --> 29:51.389
No, I'd rather not right now.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.059
Max, I'm sorry.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.461
I just don't understand.
I do not understand.

29:55.485 --> 29:57.196
You sang a love song to me today,

29:57.220 --> 30:00.098
and then right after that, you sang
another love song to Simon?

30:00.123 --> 30:02.116
Do you have any idea
how messed up that is?

30:02.141 --> 30:04.536
I know. Believe me,
if I had any control over this, I...

30:04.561 --> 30:06.202
Then you wouldn't sing
to which one of us,

30:06.227 --> 30:09.266
your best friend or the morally
questionable, totally engaged guy?

30:09.291 --> 30:11.676
I am just as surprised as
you are that I sang to Simon.

30:11.701 --> 30:14.411
I had no idea those words were
about to come out of my mouth.

30:14.436 --> 30:17.337
That's great, Zoey.
Blame the powers again.

30:22.950 --> 30:25.247
You can't be mad at me for singing
a song that I didn't mean to sing.

30:25.271 --> 30:26.310
- Really? It actually seems
- Really.

30:26.334 --> 30:27.544
like the best reason to be mad at you,

30:27.568 --> 30:29.201
because when you sing,
you're singing the truth.

30:29.225 --> 30:31.169
And the truth isn't that
you can't be with me

30:31.194 --> 30:32.942
because it's endangering our friendship.

30:32.967 --> 30:35.129
No, we can't be together,
because you have feelings

30:35.154 --> 30:36.965
for two men at the same time.

30:36.990 --> 30:38.051
Do I?

30:38.308 --> 30:39.633
Because I'm not sure I even knew

30:39.658 --> 30:41.289
I had those feelings until I sang them.

30:41.314 --> 30:44.088
Well, they're out there,
and you can't take 'em back.

30:44.395 --> 30:46.213
You sang two heart songs today, Zoey.

30:46.238 --> 30:47.519
That's what they're called, right?

30:47.543 --> 30:50.448
And while one song told you
that you want Simon to want you,

30:50.473 --> 30:52.627
the other one told you that I'm yours.

30:53.549 --> 30:55.276
One song is about attraction.

30:55.301 --> 30:57.143
The other one's about love.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.836
Personally, I would choose love,

31:02.861 --> 31:06.563
but I guess you're gonna
make up your own mind.

31:12.949 --> 31:15.018
'Sup, dude? 'Sup, Zoey?

31:21.520 --> 31:23.713
Are we gossiping about someone?

31:23.738 --> 31:26.088
Tell me what you heard.
I'll tell you if it's true.

31:26.113 --> 31:28.981
If it's Susan from HR,
it's definitely true.

31:38.404 --> 31:40.096
Oh, hey, grab coffee with me.

31:40.121 --> 31:41.495
- I really need to...
- Don't care.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.510
- Okay.
- I heard from Danny.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.831
- And?
- Well, he says he thinks

31:45.856 --> 31:48.035
you're weird, which is a pretty
big statement coming from him,

31:48.059 --> 31:50.071
and he said he looked at your timeline,

31:50.096 --> 31:53.346
which seems to imply The Chirp
is going to take about a year.

31:53.371 --> 31:55.963
I tried so hard to make
that year not look like a year.

31:56.550 --> 31:58.924
And he said he's gonna
give us the money we need.

31:58.949 --> 32:00.877
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:01.307 --> 32:02.354
Why?

32:02.379 --> 32:04.385
I mean, I guess he liked the pitch?

32:04.410 --> 32:06.221
Crazy attracts crazy?

32:06.246 --> 32:07.523
That's great.

32:07.548 --> 32:09.148
Don't start celebrating just yet.

32:11.134 --> 32:14.698
Why did you not express
concern about the timeline?

32:14.723 --> 32:16.776
- I tried.
- And that song?

32:16.801 --> 32:19.682
You performed a song for Danny.
That was a big swing.

32:19.707 --> 32:21.940
I don't mind a big swing,
but I can't not know about it.

32:21.965 --> 32:24.916
I can't be the one who
doesn't know things.

32:24.941 --> 32:28.120
Then...

32:28.336 --> 32:30.276
I should probably tell you

32:30.301 --> 32:32.698
that I saw you and Leif kissing...

32:32.723 --> 32:34.393
in the office the other night.

32:34.418 --> 32:38.323
Oh, God, it was a mistake.
It was a huge, colossal mistake.

32:38.348 --> 32:39.979
It's against everything I stand for

32:40.004 --> 32:41.248
personally and professionally.

32:41.273 --> 32:43.510
I know this is none
my business, but I...

32:43.535 --> 32:45.909
I just want to tell you, as your friend,

32:45.934 --> 32:50.768
that I think Leif might not be
in this for the right reasons.

32:54.582 --> 32:55.979
Good.

32:56.004 --> 32:58.683
Can you imagine if either of us
was in it for the right reasons?

32:58.708 --> 33:00.612
- Oh, my God, no. I...
- Oh.

33:00.637 --> 33:02.144
Please, thank you for telling me that.

33:02.168 --> 33:03.784
That is such a relief.

33:04.117 --> 33:05.370
- Okay.
- Was I caught up

33:05.395 --> 33:06.456
in a moment of passion?

33:06.481 --> 33:08.729
I was. And did it happen
again later at my house?

33:08.754 --> 33:10.682
- It did. Will it ever happen again?
- Whoa.

33:10.707 --> 33:13.393
I can tell you absolutely not.

33:13.418 --> 33:16.377
I can guarantee I can
stop any time I want.

33:16.402 --> 33:18.877
And in fact, after we're done here,

33:18.902 --> 33:23.409
I'm gonna go up, and I am
going to tell him it's ov...

33:23.434 --> 33:25.198
Oh, I have a meeting.

33:25.223 --> 33:27.166
Tomorrow is actually a good...

33:27.191 --> 33:30.479
Ooh. No, cardio funk. I have a blowout?

33:30.504 --> 33:32.127
Getting another dog?

33:34.540 --> 33:37.307
Okay, so, um, do you want to know

33:37.332 --> 33:39.456
what that was before with the song?

33:39.481 --> 33:41.799
I'm not exactly sure why you sang it,

33:41.824 --> 33:45.236
but sure looked and sounded
like you want me to want you.

33:45.261 --> 33:46.846
Is that what you were going for there?

33:46.871 --> 33:50.073
If I sang it, I must have meant it.

33:51.816 --> 33:54.221
That's a strange way
to phrase that. Um...

33:55.715 --> 33:57.026
I'm confused.

33:57.051 --> 33:58.433
I thought there was nothing between us.

33:58.457 --> 34:00.526
We decided there was nothing between us,

34:00.551 --> 34:03.002
and now I don't know what to think.

34:03.268 --> 34:05.647
Maybe I couldn't keep the
truth inside of me anymore

34:05.672 --> 34:07.383
so it, like, had to come out,

34:07.408 --> 34:10.885
and I don't want to ruin
anything for you or Jessica,

34:10.909 --> 34:15.268
but maybe I do have
residual feelings for you,

34:15.293 --> 34:16.969
feelings that I can't just lie about.

34:16.995 --> 34:19.940
So there you go.

34:19.966 --> 34:21.510
Now you know.

34:21.534 --> 34:23.362
Hey, that rhymed.

34:34.190 --> 34:35.202
- I need to go.
- We should go?

34:35.226 --> 34:36.510
- Yeah, okay.
- Going.

34:36.534 --> 34:37.667
Mm-hmm.

34:47.378 --> 34:49.755
Zoey.

34:50.166 --> 34:52.088
I found the mistake. Watch is fixed.

34:52.112 --> 34:54.025
That's good. Crisis averted.

34:55.308 --> 34:56.877
Yeah, but it was my fault.

34:56.902 --> 34:58.446
I was the one who wrote that code,

34:58.471 --> 35:00.924
so maybe Leif is right,
and maybe I'm just a screw-up

35:00.949 --> 35:02.377
who doesn't take my job seriously.

35:02.402 --> 35:05.882
Or we all make mistakes,
and you owned up to yours

35:05.907 --> 35:07.792
and spent all day working
super hard trying to fix it,

35:07.816 --> 35:09.784
and that doesn't sound
like a screw-up to me.

35:09.809 --> 35:11.440
All right, let's go with your version.

35:11.465 --> 35:12.498
Bye.

35:16.428 --> 35:19.081
Hey, why is your mom
asking me if you're okay?

35:19.106 --> 35:20.221
- She texted you?
- Yeah.

35:20.246 --> 35:21.624
She said she's called a few times.

35:21.649 --> 35:23.182
- She wants you to call her back.
- Oh.

35:23.207 --> 35:24.971
I haven't looked at my phone all day.

35:24.996 --> 35:26.541
Well, maybe you should.

35:26.864 --> 35:28.416
People are really worrying about you.

35:28.441 --> 35:29.474
Okay.

35:36.975 --> 35:39.509
My father only has a few weeks left.

35:45.714 --> 35:48.159
That feels so weird to say.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.690
We found out this morning.

35:54.075 --> 35:55.519
Or at least I think it was this morning.

35:55.543 --> 35:57.721
This day just keeps going
and going and going.

35:57.746 --> 35:58.932
Zoey, I'm so sorry.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.815
And when the doctor told me, I just...

36:04.982 --> 36:07.549
I ran away. I couldn't face it.

36:10.382 --> 36:12.916
And now I'm supposed to go home,

36:13.284 --> 36:15.854
so we can all talk about it.

36:18.966 --> 36:20.510
I don't know how to be around him.

36:20.535 --> 36:21.581
I don't know what to say.

36:21.606 --> 36:23.862
I don't know how I'm supposed
to look him in the eye.

36:23.887 --> 36:25.362
I don't...

36:26.479 --> 36:28.157
I don't think I can do it.

36:28.182 --> 36:29.596
Yes, you can.

36:29.745 --> 36:31.541
I know you can.

36:31.566 --> 36:33.690
- Were you even here today?
- Were you?

36:34.604 --> 36:36.100
'Cause here's what I saw.

36:36.428 --> 36:39.506
All day long, you were laying
down truths to everyone,

36:39.531 --> 36:44.191
Joan, Leif, Danny Michael Davis,
me, Simon.

36:44.216 --> 36:45.660
And guess what?

36:45.685 --> 36:46.996
You made it through.

36:47.021 --> 36:49.321
You didn't get fired. Nobody hates you.

36:51.554 --> 36:53.910
Maybe just a little bit.

36:57.032 --> 36:59.207
I honestly don't know how much longer

36:59.232 --> 37:01.743
I can go on singing out loud like this.

37:02.413 --> 37:03.996
Isn't the whole point of your powers

37:04.021 --> 37:06.097
to help people face things
they don't want to face?

37:06.463 --> 37:08.597
Maybe everything that happened today

37:08.622 --> 37:09.980
is the universe telling you

37:10.005 --> 37:12.433
you need to stop avoiding it

37:12.458 --> 37:14.058
and go face your father.

37:18.095 --> 37:19.626
You've got this.

37:31.973 --> 37:33.925
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

37:36.091 --> 37:37.754
Ohh.

37:38.931 --> 37:40.886
That's a big hug.

37:41.122 --> 37:42.871
I'm so glad you made it.

37:42.896 --> 37:45.668
Uh, David and Emily
just ran out to grab dinner.

37:45.693 --> 37:47.193
Hey, Zoey.

37:48.615 --> 37:51.480
So I'm gonna give you
guys some alone time,

37:51.505 --> 37:55.371
but if you need anything,
I mean anything...

37:55.396 --> 37:58.058
Seriously, I will rob
a store if you tell me to.

37:59.396 --> 38:01.183
I'll be chilling in the guest room.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.808
Okay. I think we're okay, Howie.

38:03.833 --> 38:06.050
- How's my dad doing?
- He's fine.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.793
He's just binge watching a show

38:08.818 --> 38:10.896
about surviving alone in the arctic.

38:10.921 --> 38:13.324
Seems very relaxing.

38:19.315 --> 38:21.394
You gonna go talk to him?

38:23.042 --> 38:24.453
Yeah.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.293
I mean...

38:28.044 --> 38:30.597
I think I'm kind of afraid to, but...

38:31.446 --> 38:32.738
I want to.

38:32.763 --> 38:34.238
Yeah.

38:40.141 --> 38:41.855
Hey, Dad.

38:47.379 --> 38:51.081
Did that man j-just kill a moose?

39:00.565 --> 39:04.816
Can we, um, talk for a sec?

39:11.093 --> 39:13.488
I feel horrible telling you this, but...

39:14.730 --> 39:17.621
I didn't want to come here tonight.

39:20.032 --> 39:22.833
After the doctor, things just got...

39:24.252 --> 39:25.785
real.

39:27.837 --> 39:29.722
And I don't know why, but...

39:31.199 --> 39:34.746
my instinct was to run away from you.

39:37.327 --> 39:39.605
Which I guess makes me

39:39.630 --> 39:43.010
the worst daughter in
the world, because..

39:45.169 --> 39:50.583
what kind of kid is scared
to be with their dying dad?

41:22.495 --> 41:25.816
Just watching this show about survival.
