WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.202
Only on Fox.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.139
Narrator:
Tonight...

00:06.173 --> 00:09.176
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:09.209 --> 00:12.245
...the one and only,
Gordon Ramsay.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.081
- I see you, Chef.
- Want a picture?

00:14.114 --> 00:16.650
- ...a culinary legend...
- That's my mentor.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.987
...joins the top seven as
they attempt to turn trash...

00:20.020 --> 00:23.156
There's carcasses.
What am I gonna do with this?

00:23.190 --> 00:27.160
- ...into treasure.
- This is a real showstopper.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.762
- Excuse me, look away.
- Whoa!

00:28.796 --> 00:30.230
( whistles )

00:30.263 --> 00:31.999
Mmm.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.266
That's America's next
MasterChef right there.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.302
Competition over.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.207
( music playing )

00:45.045 --> 00:47.715
- Gordon: Welcome back.
- Aarón: Gerron!

00:47.748 --> 00:49.850
- Head to your stations, please.
- Farhan: Top seven.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.219
I came into "MasterChef"
wanting to show America

00:52.252 --> 00:54.021
what Indian food is all about.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.923
Now it's time to show
my versatility.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.791
Hello, hello.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.594
I'm learning so much from Aarón
and him mentoring me

01:00.628 --> 01:02.696
that I'm beginning to see

01:02.730 --> 01:05.198
that I have the chops
to be the next MasterChef,

01:05.232 --> 01:08.068
and the light
at the end of the tunnel
is getting closer.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.803
Good to see you all.

01:11.571 --> 01:15.575
We're down to seven
super talented amateur cooks.

01:15.609 --> 01:19.046
Very soon,
one of you will win

01:19.079 --> 01:21.248
a quarter of a million dollars,

01:21.281 --> 01:23.951
and walk out of here with...

01:24.952 --> 01:27.788
the MasterChef trophy.

01:27.821 --> 01:31.759
Let's get right into our next
mystery box challenge.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.832
On the count of three,
lift those boxes.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.903
One, two, three!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.571
Lift them.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.673
Oh!

01:45.706 --> 01:47.074
Cesar: Okay.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.909
Is that chicken livers?

01:48.942 --> 01:51.244
- ( sniffs )
- Hmm.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.247
Whoa, wait a minute.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.817
I see a bunch of trash,

01:56.850 --> 01:59.019
a bunch of groceries
that have been used.

01:59.052 --> 02:02.022
There's carcasses.
What am I gonna do with this?

02:02.055 --> 02:05.158
These are ingredients
that are mostly discarded

02:05.192 --> 02:07.861
by home cooks and chefs alike.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.530
What you see are

02:10.563 --> 02:12.532
- carrot tops, beet tops,
- Ashley: Yeah.

02:12.565 --> 02:15.635
chicken livers, beef trimmings
and bits of fat,

02:15.669 --> 02:18.271
fish roe, hamachi collar,

02:18.305 --> 02:21.608
chicken carcasses, juice pulp,

02:21.641 --> 02:23.844
and stems of cauliflower
and broccoli.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.713
Nice.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.648
According to the Food and
Agricultural Organization

02:28.682 --> 02:30.117
of the United Nations,

02:30.150 --> 02:33.120
1.3 billion tons of food

02:33.153 --> 02:35.155
ends up in the trash
every year.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.857
In the last few years,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.959
there's been a huge movement
to reducing food waste

02:38.992 --> 02:42.696
and it's an important mission
for us here at "MasterChef."

02:42.730 --> 02:44.064
For sure.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.733
Along with those
often wasted ingredients,

02:45.766 --> 02:50.070
you'll only have access
to the MasterChef staple pantry.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.205
Use that staple
pantry box wisely.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.207
- Okay.
- Gordon: And guess what?

02:54.241 --> 02:55.976
The winner
of tonight's challenge

02:56.009 --> 02:58.912
will get
a critical advantage

02:58.946 --> 03:00.313
in the upcoming elimination.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.149
Very cool.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.819
Tonight, we have invited
a special guest

03:05.853 --> 03:08.221
- to cook with you all.
- Nice!

03:08.255 --> 03:12.059
To show you what they can do
with discarded ingredients

03:12.092 --> 03:14.561
- like the ones you have
in front of you.
- Oh, wow.

03:14.594 --> 03:18.098
Please, face the door
and welcome...

03:20.567 --> 03:22.535
...the one and only...

03:22.569 --> 03:24.772
- Julia: Are you kidding me?
- ...Chef Gordon Ramsay.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.606
Bowen:
Oh, my God!

03:29.709 --> 03:31.678
( laughs )
It's my mentor!

03:31.711 --> 03:33.180
- Yes!
- Joe: Gordon, please
take your station.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.348
Oh, I'm so excited.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.952
I can always learn a thing or
two or five from Chef Ramsay.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.621
- Wow!
- I feel so honored.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.858
Like, Gordon Ramsay is
about to throw down.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.559
All right, home cooks
and Chef Ramsay,

03:46.593 --> 03:48.128
you'll have just 45 minutes

03:48.161 --> 03:50.697
to turn this trash
into a MasterChef-worthy dish.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.800
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

03:52.833 --> 03:54.034
I was born ready.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.603
Your 45 minutes start...

03:58.238 --> 03:59.339
...now.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.912
Ashley: Chef, do you know
what you're doing?

04:04.945 --> 04:07.114
That's a really good question.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.917
- Ask me that again
in ten minutes time, please.
- Okay, perfect.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.886
My dad's a butcher,

04:12.920 --> 04:14.154
and it really makes you think

04:14.187 --> 04:15.288
about where your food
comes from,

04:15.322 --> 04:17.090
and honoring the ingredients.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.592
Well, I'm really excited
about doing a fresh pappardelle,

04:19.626 --> 04:22.595
and I'm gonna do
an oven-roasted hamachi collar.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.264
And then I'm doing
a green curry sauce

04:24.297 --> 04:27.500
using the pulp
to go along with it.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.069
Julia:
I'm making some pastry dough,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.805
because I'm thinking
of a chicken pot pie,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.307
but I'm doing it upscale
with the mushrooms

04:34.341 --> 04:36.476
and the chicken being
a little bit more refined.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.145
It's hard for me
to keep focused,

04:38.178 --> 04:40.680
because it's really hard
not to watch Gordon cook.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.582
( laughs )

04:42.615 --> 04:44.617
Aarón:
Unbelievable.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.920
We're down to the top seven
home cooks in all of America.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.655
And Gordon's cooking
with them.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.258
This is the first time
in the history of "MasterChef"

04:51.291 --> 04:53.593
we've ever dedicated
the mystery box

04:53.626 --> 04:55.662
completely to waste
in the kitchen.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.764
And this is such
a difficult challenge,

04:57.797 --> 04:59.933
'cause you have
this open canvas.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.603
Joe:
Very tricky, but they entered
here weeks ago.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.638
They've lived in
this MasterChef kitchen.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.507
So, I wanna see a dish from them

05:07.540 --> 05:10.543
that I could put
on my restaurant menu tonight.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.112
Dear, oh, dear.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.148
In China, we always eat
different part of animals,

05:15.182 --> 05:17.217
because good chef
never wastes nothing.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.687
So today I will do
a fried chicken liver

05:20.720 --> 05:24.524
with a sautéed
mushroom cream sauce,

05:24.557 --> 05:28.862
on top of Italian pasta
with caviar for the garnish,

05:28.896 --> 05:31.231
because I want to redeem myself
from the last challenge.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.532
Nice.

05:32.565 --> 05:35.035
Joe:
34 minutes left, guys.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.137
All right, Gerron.
I had eight aprons.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.239
You're my only shot left.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.641
- I know this.
- It's just you.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.543
- What are you making today?
- Me and my fiancée, Brandi,

05:43.576 --> 05:45.145
we eat Italian food
a couple times a week,

05:45.178 --> 05:46.746
and so I'm gonna make
a fresh pasta.

05:46.779 --> 05:49.682
I'm gonna toss the roe
and the lemon cream sauce,

05:49.716 --> 05:51.818
but I also have
some homemade stock

05:51.851 --> 05:54.654
- that I'm tossing in
to give it that fishy flavor.
- Okay.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.990
Then I have some of the--
like, the cheeks from the fish

05:57.024 --> 05:59.159
- that I'm gonna put
inside the pasta.
- That sounds really good.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.028
Make sure your pasta's
like silk.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.996
I got a lot
riding on you, Gerron.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.965
- I got you.
I won't let you down. Yup.
- Thanks, bro.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.671
All right, so, Samantha,
what do you got going on?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.206
It's gonna be kind of
like a soup.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.943
I have the chicken carcass
to make a bone broth.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.578
I'm gonna really utilize
that juice pulp here,

06:18.611 --> 06:20.948
- Yeah.
- 'cause this has, like, kale,

06:20.981 --> 06:23.883
and ginger, and all those
wonderful flavors in there.

06:23.917 --> 06:27.921
Something I have learned
from my mom is to make stock,

06:27.955 --> 06:30.523
and I use that
all the time in college.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.791
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.029
All right, Ashley,
what do you got going on?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.430
I'm really excited
about this challenge.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.732
You know, Grandma
never threw anything away,

06:39.766 --> 06:41.701
- so I'm really channeling her
right now.
- What is the dish?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.971
I'm going for
a stuffed agnolotti.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.273
- You made fresh pasta already?
- Yes, it's resting,

06:46.306 --> 06:48.541
and I used some
of the juice puree.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.710
It's going to be filled
with the chicken livers,

06:50.743 --> 06:52.879
and I also have some chicken
skin in the oven right now.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.714
- That's great.
- Careful.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.649
- Well, good luck, Ashley.
- Thank you.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.885
Aarón:
All right, so just
over 15 minutes, guys.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.954
Cesar:
Gotta do something
with that hamachi.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.789
- All right, Cesar.
Talk to me about your dish.
- Hi, Chef.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.225
I have never cooked with waste,
so it's really cool.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.995
I'm gonna be making
grilled chicken liver skewers

07:08.028 --> 07:12.632
with sautéed beet tops,
with some roasted
mushrooms in there,

07:12.665 --> 07:16.136
and a little bit of pickled
broccoli and cauliflower stems.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.238
And I wanna use that guy,
hamachi,

07:18.271 --> 07:19.806
maybe make a surf
and turf idea.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.474
Chicken livers are
a very hard proposition

07:21.508 --> 07:23.010
- to make look good.
- Yes. Right.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.611
And I need you,
'cause you have my apron on,

07:24.644 --> 07:26.679
you're one of my three,

07:26.713 --> 07:29.916
- to put your idea together
and make a cohesive dish.
- Okay.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.951
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.620
Mm-mm-mm!

07:35.155 --> 07:36.689
Whose idea was this?

07:36.723 --> 07:39.292
All right, Chef.
What's going on?

07:39.326 --> 07:41.294
I'm gonna do an appetizer,
an entrée and a dessert.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.297
You're gonna do an entire three
course dinner in 45 minutes.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.665
I'm trying.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.167
So I've blitzed
the chicken liver parfait.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.002
It's in the fridge setting.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.172
This is the hamachi collar
braised with a carrot top
chimichurri,

07:52.205 --> 07:53.540
with roasted stems
from the mushroom.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.608
How you gonna make a dessert
with scraps?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.210
So, beetroots can be
caramelized into a dessert,

07:57.244 --> 07:59.546
so it's a salty caramel.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.115
- Have you tested these yet?
Yeah.
- The chimichurri? Yes.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.650
Might need a little seasoning,
a little salt there.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.485
Thank you for that.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.654
See this ingredient? It's
the mystery ingredient today.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.489
- It's called salt.
- Come on, Joe.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.224
Please, I'm busy.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.792
Man!

08:12.825 --> 08:15.195
Joe:
Guys, just nine minutes left.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.498
Aarón:
We all gave out aprons.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.801
Right now, currently,
I have three out there.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.736
Gordon has three aprons.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.238
More salt.

08:26.706 --> 08:29.742
I have one.
I have Gerron as my last hope,

08:29.776 --> 08:31.711
but his dish sounds amazing.

08:31.744 --> 08:32.979
You know, I'm very,
very impressed.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.048
90 seconds left.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.516
Final push.

08:36.549 --> 08:37.917
All right, come on,
Gerron, you got this.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.186
Aarón:
Start thinking about plating.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.254
Let's go, Cesar.
Come on!

08:41.288 --> 08:42.555
Joe:
Put it in the plate, guys.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.524
We want beautiful dishes.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.259
Aarón:
Here we go.

08:46.293 --> 08:51.664
Aarón and Joe:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

08:51.698 --> 08:56.669
five, four, three, two, one.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.205
- Joe: Stop.
- Aarón: That's it.
Hands in the air.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.450
That was a very difficult
mystery box challenge

09:10.483 --> 09:13.386
using kitchen waste.

09:13.420 --> 09:18.057
Chef Ramsay,
please bring your appetizer,
entrée and dessert

09:18.091 --> 09:19.426
so we can taste them.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.763
- Mm-hmm!
- Wow!

09:23.796 --> 09:26.466
Unbelievable.
Look at that.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.368
- Whoa!
- Wow!

09:28.401 --> 09:29.969
Please, Chef,
tell us what you've made.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.804
For appetizer this evening,

09:31.838 --> 09:34.107
we have chicken liver
mousse parfait,

09:34.141 --> 09:36.976
topped with a rendered fat
finished with the caramelized
citrus salt,

09:37.009 --> 09:38.911
next to a chive blini.

09:38.945 --> 09:42.415
Entrée tonight, we've got that
whole hamachi collar braised

09:42.449 --> 09:45.051
in the roasted vegetable pulp,

09:45.084 --> 09:47.654
topped with a carrot top
chimichurri,

09:47.687 --> 09:51.824
finished with a salad
of pickled stems of broccoli
and cauliflower.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.493
And then our dessert
this evening

09:53.526 --> 09:56.062
is a salted caramel
beetroot stem,

09:56.095 --> 09:59.098
sandwiched in between
vanilla shortbread.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.135
- Very nice.
- Ashley: Gordon, my mentor.

10:02.169 --> 10:07.507
He did three dishes
in 45 minutes with scraps.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.742
- Mmm.
- That texture is silky.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.313
- It's smooth.
- And the mushroom stems
have this umami flavor,

10:13.346 --> 10:14.814
that just completes the dish.

10:14.847 --> 10:18.117
You wouldn't
have even expected

10:18.151 --> 10:20.453
that these would be
the throwaway ingredients,

10:20.487 --> 10:24.424
and that's what makes him
such an inspiration.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.427
That beetroot has a savoriness
to it that's beautiful.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.029
- Fantastic. Good job.
- Yeah. Really great.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.432
Now, while you worked
at your stations,

10:32.465 --> 10:35.535
Aarón and I watched
your every move,

10:35.568 --> 10:38.505
and we've tasted elements
of every single dish.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.974
We will now take a closer look
at three dishes

10:42.008 --> 10:46.879
that made excellent use
of those wasted ingredients.

10:46.913 --> 10:51.651
The first dish was made
using the chicken skin.

10:51.684 --> 10:55.722
Please step forward, Samantha.

10:55.755 --> 10:59.526
Samantha:
I am just blown away
that as a college student

10:59.559 --> 11:02.562
learning to stretch my budget
and stretch every ingredient

11:02.595 --> 11:05.565
would get me in the top three
for the challenge.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.868
I really think this was
the perfect mystery box for me.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.537
Okay, Samantha.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.871
What's the dish?

11:11.904 --> 11:14.507
Chicken bone broth

11:14.541 --> 11:17.477
infused with that
beautiful juice pulp

11:17.510 --> 11:20.880
and some thinly sliced
cauliflower stems,

11:20.913 --> 11:22.982
and crispy chicken skin
on top.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.817
So it's basically
like a green chicken soup.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.820
Yeah. Exactly.
I incorporated a lot

11:27.854 --> 11:31.157
of that juice pulp
to really enrich this broth.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.494
I wanted to show that you can
make a healthy dish
out of those scraps.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.398
Considering 45 minutes,
it has an incredible
depth of flavor.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.501
- You taste certainly
the ginger and the kale.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.403
Great use of the pulp.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.872
And I really think combining
the chicken broth

11:45.905 --> 11:48.341
with that green pulp
was probably one

11:48.375 --> 11:50.343
of the smartest things
anyone did out there.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.778
- Thank you.
- Because it doesn't taste
like leftover

11:51.811 --> 11:54.414
- or waste to me at all.
- Mm-mm.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.384
This tastes like a dish
that you would pay money for
in a restaurant.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.419
- Really, really good, Samantha.
- Thank you.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.691
Wow!

12:04.724 --> 12:08.127
- Excuse me, look away.
- ( laughs )

12:08.160 --> 12:09.762
Mmm. I mean,
it's delicious.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.432
Hearty, packed with flavor.
What would I change?

12:12.465 --> 12:14.301
Maybe flash-fry
some of those livers.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.735
- Okay.
- Chop them up
and run the liver through,

12:15.768 --> 12:17.470
so you got sort of
that Vietnamese style.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.106
- Sure.
- But if this is
what you can do

12:20.139 --> 12:22.709
with bits that are unwanted,

12:22.742 --> 12:25.478
heaven knows what you can do

12:25.512 --> 12:28.047
- with a box full of magical
perfect ingredients.
- Okay.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.782
Great job.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.918
- Nice job, Sam.
- Thanks.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.423
The second dish
that we would like to examine

12:36.456 --> 12:40.993
is from a home cook that used
the staple box and made a pasta.

12:41.027 --> 12:44.464
Please, bring your dish forward,
Miss Ashley.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.400
I couldn't be more excited!

12:47.434 --> 12:49.101
Top three!

12:49.135 --> 12:52.905
And I am just glad
that with these ingredients

12:52.939 --> 12:56.443
I was able to honor
my grandmother's favorite meal.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.977
Describe the dish,
please.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.681
Juice pulp herb
agnolotti

13:01.714 --> 13:05.985
stuffed with chicken livers,
some crispy chicken skin,

13:06.018 --> 13:08.488
and sautéed mushroom
brown butter sauce.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.423
So, you're a personal
grocery shopper.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.694
This theme of utilizing waste,
did it speak to you?

13:14.727 --> 13:16.996
It absolutely spoke to me.

13:17.029 --> 13:21.501
When I get to tell the client
how to stretch their dollar

13:21.534 --> 13:24.103
and use every aspect
of an ingredient
that they buy,

13:24.136 --> 13:25.872
it just gets me excited.
It makes me happy.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.940
What I really love
about the taste

13:27.974 --> 13:30.510
is you brought the best
elements of chicken
liver out for me.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.946
- Awesome.
- Which is iron-y, creamy, rich,

13:33.980 --> 13:35.782
and the herbs
in that juice pulp

13:35.815 --> 13:37.617
really help lift up
the actual pasta itself.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.951
Yes.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.020
And then of course
the chicken skin

13:41.053 --> 13:43.823
is a little bit of a respite
from the richness of the pasta

13:43.856 --> 13:45.658
- and it's a textural note.
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.293
If I were to do this
differently,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.362
I would just give me a bit
little more mushrooms.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.498
- I think they're
a little dainty.
- Okay.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.633
But this is
a real showstopper of a dish.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.034
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.375
This dish respects the
traditions of the pasta norm.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.876
The agnolotti are great.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.978
The texture of the pasta
is spot-on.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.916
If I had to change one thing,
you know what it would be?

14:09.949 --> 14:12.652
- See that pin.
- Mm-hmm.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.887
It'd say "JB."

14:14.921 --> 14:16.423
Yes!
I gotcha, Joe.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.524
Thank you.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.394
Good job!

14:21.428 --> 14:24.897
The third and final dish
we'd like to examine

14:24.931 --> 14:30.670
made expert use of both
the fish and the meat.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.540
Please, bring up your dish,
Cesar.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.008
- Yes.
- Let's go, young man.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.846
It's been a long time since
I've been part of the top three
in a mystery box,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.048
and although I've never worked
with scraps before,

14:42.081 --> 14:43.416
I just made a beautiful dish
with them.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.085
Cesar, describe the dish,
please.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.555
Today I made grilled chicken
liver skewers

14:48.588 --> 14:52.559
with braised beet tops,
roasted mushrooms stems,

14:52.592 --> 14:56.463
and underneath it, pickled
broccoli and cauliflower stems.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.631
It looks breathtaking.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.967
What was going
through your thoughts
when you unveiled that box?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.102
I thought about the conversation
my dad had with me,

15:03.135 --> 15:07.474
how when he first came
to this country,

15:07.507 --> 15:08.875
it was difficult for him
to find a job

15:08.908 --> 15:10.577
and he would go
dumpster diving

15:10.610 --> 15:13.446
behind grocery stores
and eat with that.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.381
And because of all those
sacrifices he made,

15:15.414 --> 15:18.117
I could stand here
and cook with scraps.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.820
- So, it was an inspiration.
- What an amazing story
to bring that on the plate.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.555
Who would've thought ten years
ago you'd be standing here

15:22.589 --> 15:25.424
and evolving a dish based
on what Dad stood for?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.960
I just wish he was here right
now to taste that, because
it was cooked with heart.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.428
- Let's get that right.
- Yeah.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.797
Liver's cooked
beautifully.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.298
But then you got
that pickling.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.467
That just lifts it
to restaurant quality.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.136
And underneath it,
you got the mushroom sauce
finessed beyond belief.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.838
It's delicious.

15:38.871 --> 15:42.308
I'm so happy that something
can taste so beautiful

15:42.341 --> 15:43.409
from a box of leftovers.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.877
- Great job.
- Thank you.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.350
It's rich, it's homey.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.486
It's well-seasoned.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.423
And I just love that you chose
the mushroom stems
as the base of it,

15:57.456 --> 16:00.326
'cause they are meaty and they
stand up to the chicken livers.

16:00.359 --> 16:03.930
It gives me a lot of joy
to see you grow,

16:03.963 --> 16:06.098
'cause not only
do you have my pin,

16:06.132 --> 16:11.337
you're a great representative
for our culture and our food.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.706
- Great job.
- Thank you.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.142
- Three amazing dishes.
- Yeah.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.712
Yeah, I agree.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.981
( indistinct chatter )

16:24.517 --> 16:28.120
Three incredible dishes,
but as always,

16:28.154 --> 16:30.790
only one of you
is the winner.

16:30.823 --> 16:36.796
The person who won tonight's
mystery box challenge,

16:36.829 --> 16:40.132
the home cook that will take
a big advantage

16:40.166 --> 16:42.301
into the next round
of this competition--

16:42.334 --> 16:46.038
Congratulations...

16:53.079 --> 16:56.849
The person who won tonight's
mystery box challenge,

16:56.883 --> 17:00.419
and the home cook
that will take a big advantage

17:00.452 --> 17:02.555
into the next round
of this competition...

17:02.589 --> 17:05.825
- ...Cesar.
- ( whispers ) Yes.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.895
You made a fantastic dish.
Congratulations.

17:08.928 --> 17:11.363
- Thank you, Joe.
- And you made Aarón very proud.

17:11.397 --> 17:14.433
Please head to the balcony.
Enjoy your success.

17:14.466 --> 17:17.704
Cesar: I win again!
Second mystery box.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.405
I'm so proud of my dish,

17:19.438 --> 17:21.373
and it's amazing and rewarding

17:21.407 --> 17:23.242
to have the judges validate
that feeling.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.944
There's no other place
in the MasterChef kitchen

17:24.977 --> 17:27.513
that I'd rather be than watching
from that beautiful view

17:27.546 --> 17:29.849
up in the balcony.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.584
Cesar, congratulations.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.886
- Thank you.
- Your first advantage is

17:33.920 --> 17:36.288
that you are now safe
and you will not be cooking

17:36.322 --> 17:38.891
in tonight's tough
elimination challenge.

17:38.925 --> 17:43.696
You'll learn about
your next advantage
a little later tonight.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.965
- All right.
- As for the rest of you,

17:45.998 --> 17:49.869
all of you will be cooking
in the elimination challenge.

17:49.902 --> 17:54.741
And at least one of you
will be cooking in here
for the very last time.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.776
Please, come to the front.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.582
This next challenge is
quite a departure

18:03.616 --> 18:06.485
from your first earlier
this evening.

18:08.655 --> 18:13.425
- These are the complete, whole,
untouched ingredients
- Oh, wow!

18:13.459 --> 18:15.327
you cooked with earlier.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.097
So we've gone
from the unwanted scraps

18:18.130 --> 18:20.332
to the Rolls-Royce ingredients.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.634
Wow!

18:21.668 --> 18:24.671
Here we have an amazing
whole chicken,

18:24.704 --> 18:27.339
rib eye steak, hamachi fillet,

18:27.373 --> 18:29.909
beautiful beets,
fresh kale,

18:29.942 --> 18:32.411
broccoli, whole cauliflower,
fresh ginger.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.580
Top seven.
There are no excuses.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.683
All of you please
head to your stations.

18:36.716 --> 18:40.286
There's so much more pressure
when you have a perfect
ingredient

18:40.319 --> 18:42.955
and you have to elevate it.

18:42.989 --> 18:46.592
But I have no idea
what I'm cooking tonight.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.095
Along with these incredible
ingredients, once again,

18:49.128 --> 18:54.300
you will have access
to the incredible
MasterChef staple box.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.635
You'll have 45 minutes

18:56.669 --> 19:00.439
to make us the best dish
of your lives.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.474
Your time starts...

19:04.410 --> 19:06.012
...now.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.513
- Aarón: Come on, guys,
let's go.
- Go, go, go!

19:11.350 --> 19:14.020
Coming from Kentucky, you know,
I love those Southern flavors.

19:14.053 --> 19:18.024
So I'm making braised chicken
thighs with sautéed kale.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.959
I feel the pressure being
the only person with Joe's pin.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.961
I don't wanna let Joe down,
you know.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.096
Tunnel vision, baby.
I'm going to the finale.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.068
I'm feeling
a little bit nervous.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.504
I was in the top three
with the scraps of all
of these ingredients,

19:32.538 --> 19:34.373
so I think there's a lot
of pressure on me tonight

19:34.406 --> 19:36.375
to really create
an amazing dish.

19:36.408 --> 19:39.511
So I'm making
a pan-seared rib eye

19:39.545 --> 19:42.081
with a mushroom cream sauce

19:42.114 --> 19:44.851
on a bed of a carrot
vinaigrette slaw.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.386
I really want to do
all these ingredients justice

19:47.419 --> 19:49.588
and get a great dish out
tonight.

19:51.623 --> 19:54.360
All right, guys, when you do
like a perfect shop like this

19:54.393 --> 19:56.996
and bring home the best
ingredients you can find,

19:57.029 --> 19:59.531
your expectation level
both as a cook

19:59.565 --> 20:01.667
and us as judges goes
to the roof.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.435
What are we looking
for tonight?

20:03.469 --> 20:05.504
For the six now cooking,
we're looking for great finesse,

20:05.537 --> 20:08.507
- great flavor profile.
- Season it.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.443
And not just MasterChef quality,
restaurant quality-plating.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.180
Absolutely. I want a balance
of color and texture.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.615
I wanna make sure that there's
flavors that are memorable.

20:16.648 --> 20:17.950
Nice.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.518
I'm looking
to see the journey.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.087
They entered here weeks
and weeks ago.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.755
They're the top seven now.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.523
I wanna see a dish from them

20:24.556 --> 20:26.525
that I could put on
my restaurant menu tonight.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.761
Come on, baby.
I just need you to get a little
bit more browner for me.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.129
Smells really good, guys.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.401
Coming up to 30 minutes to go.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.936
Heard, Chef.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.437
Hurry, hurry, guys.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.441
( sighs )
I don't know what I'm doing.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.476
- Julia.
- Yes, Joe.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.379
So, is this kind of
familiar turf for you,
these ingredients?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.816
The previous box was probably
a little bit easier,

20:49.849 --> 20:51.884
just because there was only
so many things that you can do.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.453
With something like this,
it's confusing

20:54.486 --> 20:55.922
because the options are
just pretty endless.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.489
What's the idea?
What are you doing?

20:57.523 --> 21:00.059
I'm gonna do a roasted
chicken breast.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.393
I have roasted beets
and carrots in the oven.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.395
I might turn it
into a puree.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.832
I'm thinking a sauce
maybe with the mushrooms,

21:05.865 --> 21:08.067
but I'm not exactly sure.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.402
- You know someone's
going home, Julia.
- I do, Joe.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.404
- Time to get sure.
- I will.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.340
- Who do you think might
be going home today?
- I'm thinking Bowen.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.408
He's done a lot
of the same cuisine,

21:16.442 --> 21:19.078
- so he might just not have
anything else to do.
- All right.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.646
Get everything done on time.
Keep your eye on the clock.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.082
- I will.
- Ashley, what you doing?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.751
A pan-seared hamachi
with a cauliflower puree

21:25.784 --> 21:28.855
- and pickled carrots.
- There's somebody going home.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.589
- Yes, Chef.
- Who do you think's losing
their edge right now?

21:30.622 --> 21:32.358
I think Bowen started off
really strong,

21:32.391 --> 21:34.360
but I just think he's
not learning anymore.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.095
Well, you're wearing
my apron.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.930
- Don't let me down.
- Yes, Chef.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.099
- Okay? Good luck.
- Yes, Chef. Thank you.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.834
Cesar:
Hurry, hurry, guys.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.635
Less than 15.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.707
- So, Farhan.
- Chef.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.709
All right, so talk to me
a little bit about your dish.

21:50.742 --> 21:52.111
I'm gonna try working
with the hamachi today.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.846
You know, I worked
with it earlier.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.482
To go along with it
I'm gonna do a crispy
kale fritter,

21:56.515 --> 21:58.017
a carrot and cucumber slaw,

21:58.050 --> 21:59.351
and then some sort
of beet puree.

21:59.385 --> 22:01.487
And for me, this has been
a lifelong dream

22:01.520 --> 22:04.456
to bring Indian food up
just like how you brought
Mexican food up.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.458
You know, being able
to work with you has
been such a blessing.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.060
Those beets,
'cause they're
so bright in color,

22:08.094 --> 22:10.129
looks like you have
lipstick on right now.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.731
- I'm just throwing
that out there, okay?
- Oh, does it? Okay.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.367
- I love that color
of lipstick on you.
- Thank you.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.403
- Thanks, Chef.
- All right, come on. Let's go.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.405
Bowen, how we doing?

22:19.438 --> 22:20.907
- I'm doing great.
- Give me an insight
to the dish.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.976
- What you cooking?
- The dish is pan-seared hamachi

22:24.010 --> 22:26.478
with kale salad
and a cauliflower puree.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.480
Top seven, top five
around the corner.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.082
Finale, where you sitting?

22:30.116 --> 22:32.484
Do you feel
you're getting stronger?

22:32.518 --> 22:35.354
- Um--
- Everybody else thinks
you're done,

22:35.387 --> 22:37.356
- and it's time for you
to go home.
- I'm not going home.

22:37.389 --> 22:41.760
I'm not base my destiny
based on their opinions.
I'm not.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.263
That'll be a great upset for me
to see you go home.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.831
I'm not going home,

22:45.864 --> 22:48.034
because I need "MasterChef"
to change my life.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.336
I want to have
my own restaurant,

22:50.369 --> 22:52.371
because everybody think
I cannot be a really good chef.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.106
Even my dad, even my mom.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.542
Hey, come on.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.044
( crying )

23:02.949 --> 23:04.283
I'm not going home,

23:04.316 --> 23:06.185
because I need "MasterChef"
to change my life.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.620
I want to have
my own restaurant,

23:08.654 --> 23:10.789
because everybody think
I cannot be a really good chef.

23:10.822 --> 23:13.259
Even my dad, even my mom.
They don't supporting me.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.526
Hey, come on.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.195
- You could do this.
- Yes.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.130
Come on, I don't want you
getting upset like that.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.199
- Hey, hey. I know you can.
- ( crying ) I can do it.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.268
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on. Hey.
Let's not worry about Mum.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.036
- Yes. Yes.
- Let's not worry about Dad.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.472
I'm here to support you, okay?
I think you can do it.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.107
Yes, thank you, Chef.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.641
Just worry about staying
in the competition.

23:29.675 --> 23:32.444
- Okay, Chef.
- Good man.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.015
Nine minutes left to go.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.650
What's happening
with Bowen?

23:38.684 --> 23:40.286
He looks like
he's totally deflated.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.453
I think the pressure
is getting to him.

23:41.487 --> 23:42.955
But also here's the thing:

23:42.989 --> 23:45.124
his parents never
wanted him to cook.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.326
So this guy's on this journey
and he feels he's
on his own now.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.995
Hustle, hustle, Bowen.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.396
I'll try my best.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.231
- Yes, sir, do it.
- Thank you, Cesar.

23:52.264 --> 23:56.068
Julia also seems
like she's just in a daze.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.237
She's not in a rhythm.
She's kind of in a funk.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.406
- Wow.
- That is extremely surprising

24:00.439 --> 24:02.108
considering she's
wearing my apron.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.176
I might be losing one
of my strongest cooks.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.212
90 seconds to go.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.417
- Final push.
- Heard, Chef. Thank you.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.085
Home stretch.
Y'all gotta hustle up.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.087
Come on, you got this.

24:15.121 --> 24:18.324
30 seconds remaining.
Come on.

24:18.357 --> 24:21.260
Come on, guys.
Make sure you get
everything on the plate.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.095
Joe:
Let's go, guys.
Put it on the plate.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.132
- Push!
- Cesar: Looking good, Farhan.

24:26.165 --> 24:31.137
- Very nice.
- Judges: Ten, nine,
eight, seven,

24:31.170 --> 24:33.705
six, five, four,

24:33.739 --> 24:37.143
three, two, one.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.145
- Gordon: And stop,
hands in the air.
- Aarón: That's it. Hands up.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.014
( applause )

24:42.048 --> 24:43.615
Wow! Well done.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.018
Now, it's time
to see how you did.

24:46.052 --> 24:49.121
But before we make
any big decisions...

24:49.155 --> 24:51.990
Cesar, you have one
huge advantage

24:52.024 --> 24:54.126
that you don't even know
about yet.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.861
Dying to know, Chef.

24:55.894 --> 25:00.732
Tonight, you will get to save
one person from elimination.

25:00.766 --> 25:02.468
Whoa.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.737
So I hope you were observing,
paying attention,

25:05.771 --> 25:08.407
and assessing
their performances.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.809
Joe:
It is time to choose

25:10.842 --> 25:14.646
who you will be saving
from elimination.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.184
I'm gonna save this home cook,

25:18.217 --> 25:21.487
because we have common goals.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.191
We have a same mission
when it comes to our food
and our cultures.

25:25.224 --> 25:30.096
and I think that would be
an ideal battle at the end.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.431
So I'm gonna save Gerron.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.339
Gerron, how you feeling, buddy?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.074
To be saved right now
is a complete blessing.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.709
Like, I don't even know
what's happening.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.177
You saved my pin?

25:45.211 --> 25:46.712
Saved your pin, Joe.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.947
What'd I tell ya?
Me and you.

25:48.980 --> 25:50.249
Take the rest of these guys out.

25:50.282 --> 25:53.785
Okay, Gerron,
head up to the balcony.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.026
- I just like you, buddy.
- Yeah.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.428
Gordon:
Gerron, congratulations.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.363
- Top six!
- Thank you, Chef.

26:04.396 --> 26:09.368
And now it's our turn to make
some very important decisions.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.704
First up, Bowen.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.707
Tonight, is kind of really
rough night for me.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.077
I had to refocus,
bring myself together,

26:19.111 --> 26:22.381
and find my confident
in the MasterChef kitchen.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.116
I want to show the judges

26:24.150 --> 26:27.219
that I didn't need Cesar
to save me tonight.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.555
Bowen, how would you
describe this dish?

26:29.588 --> 26:32.558
I made a pan-seared hamachi

26:32.591 --> 26:35.961
with a sweet
and sour kale salad,

26:35.994 --> 26:39.731
with cauliflower puree
for the garnish.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.733
And what kind of seasoning
do you have on the outside
of that hamachi?

26:41.767 --> 26:46.071
Salt and pepper, and then I
don't want to my fish to be dry.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.541
I drizzle a little bit lemon
juice to give extra moist.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.445
They look beautiful.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.113
You can see
it's glistening.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.615
It has a beautiful
opaque color to it.

26:56.648 --> 26:58.684
It doesn't look dry or brittle.

26:58.717 --> 27:00.186
- All right?
- Thank you, Chef.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.655
Mmm.

27:07.159 --> 27:11.029
Thank you for paying respect
to the noble hamachi.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.332
- Thank you.
- You did a great job.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.434
First of all,
you were aggressive
with that seasoning.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.769
Hamachi is a steak fish.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.004
It needs a lot
of aggressive seasoning.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.639
And then your greens--

27:20.672 --> 27:22.474
They're crunchy,
they're not overcooked.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.109
They have a beautiful bite
and snap to them.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.144
If I had to take you
to task on one thing,

27:26.178 --> 27:27.946
a little citrus
vinaigrette.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.315
If you had that
right on top,

27:29.348 --> 27:30.949
( snaps fingers )
home run.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.018
But well done,
young man.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.123
Mmm.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.459
This is delicious.
I'm seriously impressed.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.461
You know, hamachi's
cooked beautifully.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.162
Great finesse,
lovely seasoning.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.232
Puree, you know,
it's soft, it's creamy.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.466
What would I put in there?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.201
I'd put shards
of pickled ginger in

27:49.235 --> 27:51.337
with those vegetables
so it just lifts that.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.305
- Hamachi, ginger, you know
it's like tomato, basil.
- Yes.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.408
The irony of this dish is that
everybody standing behind you

27:56.442 --> 27:58.143
thinks that you're
going home tonight.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.511
I'm gonna guarantee you

27:59.545 --> 28:01.313
that dish will
not send you home.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.350
Thank you, Chef.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.151
Bowen:
I feel great.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.053
I feel like I'm back on track,

28:08.086 --> 28:11.357
and I focus on Bowen
in the finale.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.660
Bowen is back.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.762
Next up, Julia.

28:16.795 --> 28:19.398
Nothing really went
as I expected tonight.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.567
I struggled to come up
with a recipe.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.235
It took me a while to get it,

28:23.269 --> 28:25.671
but I've been in more pressure
tests than anyone,

28:25.704 --> 28:28.006
and I've always survived,
I've always come on top,

28:28.039 --> 28:29.541
and I intend
to still do it today.

28:29.575 --> 28:32.344
Okay, Julia, please,
tell me what the dish is.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.680
It is a roasted
chicken breast,

28:34.713 --> 28:38.684
sitting on top of cauliflower
couscous with mushrooms,

28:38.717 --> 28:41.687
a roasted beet
and carrot puree,

28:41.720 --> 28:43.522
and some crispy greens.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.190
How did you cook
the chicken breast?

28:45.223 --> 28:47.526
I pan-seared it,
finished it off in the oven,

28:47.559 --> 28:50.095
and then I basted it
with butter

28:50.128 --> 28:52.030
that I infused
with some garlic and sage.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.732
All right, let's see
how the chicken's cooked.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.567
So it's got some decent color
on the outside.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.636
And inside...

28:59.738 --> 29:01.473
Hmm.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.415
All right, let's see
how the chicken's cooked.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.383
So it's got some decent color
on the outside.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.118
And inside...

29:14.986 --> 29:16.588
Hmm.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.590
- How's that look?
- Looks perfect.

29:18.624 --> 29:21.860
I will be the judge
of that.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.732
The chicken's actually
cooked fine,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.334
but there's very little
seasoning.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.868
Kind of bland.

29:31.637 --> 29:34.940
And this puree's supposed
to be like a silky puree?

29:34.973 --> 29:36.408
No, it's a little bit
more coarse.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.076
I like the chunkiness of it.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.345
I didn't wanna thin it out
too much.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.579
I thought purees were
only smooth.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.914
I think when you roast
the vegetables,

29:42.948 --> 29:45.351
- I think it's a nice texture.
- Let me check
with my colleagues.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.353
Is there such a thing
as a grainy puree?

29:47.386 --> 29:50.021
It's called "puree" for a reason
'cause it's a smooth puree.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.424
- That's what "puree" means.
Yeah.
- Right? By definition.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.426
- So, calling a puree grainy
- It's a mash.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.828
is like admitting
there's a defect in your plate.

29:56.862 --> 29:59.365
Okay.
So it's a mash?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.367
Chunky mash?
I'm not sure.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.535
- What's in the middle here?
- It's a cauliflower couscous

30:03.569 --> 30:06.438
- with some mushrooms.
- Mmm.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.607
This is good,
this is terrible,

30:08.640 --> 30:10.609
and the chicken's--

30:10.642 --> 30:12.944
it's kinda like a chicken breast
that you can get on an airline.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.846
You know, just kinda seasoned,
cooked okay.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.048
Julia, I'm surprised.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.050
You cooked dishes in the first
few weeks that were way
more sophisticated.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.353
We're looking
for top six.

30:21.387 --> 30:22.854
Not sure.

30:30.061 --> 30:32.063
Chicken breast is boring.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.332
It needs butter, it needs fat,
it needs herbs.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.734
The puree's grainy.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.002
It's visually off-putting.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.070
The couscous is watery.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.407
This looks like something
that you would get

30:41.440 --> 30:43.442
like on a buffet platter
somewhere.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.978
You know you're here
for a reason, right?

30:47.012 --> 30:49.648
- Mm-hmm.
- You have my pin on.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.718
But this dish is so bad
that I can't make
any guarantees,

30:52.751 --> 30:54.486
and that's a shame.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.655
I understand.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.357
If I had some technical errors
tonight,

30:59.391 --> 31:01.660
I just don't think it's enough
to send me home.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.829
There really isn't anybody else
in this competition

31:03.862 --> 31:06.498
that has more passion
than I do about cooking.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.768
Next up, Ashley, please.
Let's go.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.070
Ashley:
I have never cooked
with hamachi before,

31:12.103 --> 31:13.905
but I wanna show the judges

31:13.939 --> 31:16.341
that even if I'm introduced
to a new protein,

31:16.374 --> 31:17.443
that I can handle it.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.077
This is top seven.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.413
You cannot be fearful.

31:21.447 --> 31:25.917
Like, you have to be an A-plus
student in that moment
and bring it.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.385
Ashley,
describe the dish, please.

31:27.419 --> 31:30.422
We have a pan-seared
hamachi

31:30.456 --> 31:32.458
with roasted beets,

31:32.491 --> 31:35.393
a cauliflower puree,
sautéed mushrooms,

31:35.427 --> 31:37.429
and lemon Swiss chard.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.530
How long
did you cook it for?

31:38.564 --> 31:42.434
I cooked it
for about 40 seconds

31:42.468 --> 31:46.371
on the flatter sides
and then 20 on the shorter side.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.440
Beautiful.
Seared beautifully.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.709
- What is the seasoning?
- Salt and paprika.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.545
And what have you done
with the mushrooms?

31:53.579 --> 31:56.982
I sautéed them
with some chili flakes,
salt, pepper,

31:57.015 --> 32:00.786
and then there's lemon juice
in the sautéed Swiss chard.

32:00.819 --> 32:05.056
- You know, I'm gonna
be honest with you.
- Okay.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.725
I said to you earlier

32:06.758 --> 32:08.894
the tiniest mistakes tonight
could send you home.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.498
- Mm-hmm.
- You've taken the most
dangerous protein of the night

32:12.531 --> 32:14.666
and elevated it.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.668
Really, really delicious.
Hamachi served beautifully

32:16.702 --> 32:18.403
like a nice wedge of tuna.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.839
Lovely seasoning,
puree refined.

32:20.872 --> 32:24.409
Smooth and looks beautiful
like a coat of varnish
on those black plates.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.677
Great job, great finesse.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.613
- Well done.
- Yes, Chef. Thank you.

32:36.988 --> 32:39.691
Beautiful sear and flavor
on this hamachi.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.427
Very difficult fish to cook.
These vegetables are fantastic.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.995
They're super crunchy.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.430
All the flavors come through.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.965
Very impressive.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.367
Obviously this dish in the
beginning of the competition

32:49.400 --> 32:51.670
- is not something
you could've made.
- No.

32:51.703 --> 32:55.040
- This is a result of your
journey here in "MasterChef."
- Absolutely.

32:55.073 --> 32:58.944
Gordon certainly has himself
an excellent student in you.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.946
- Thank you.
- Nice job, Ashley.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.480
Thanks.

33:05.984 --> 33:09.788
So the next home cook's dish
that we'd like to taste, Farhan.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.390
Farhan:
I'm really proud
of my dish tonight.

33:12.423 --> 33:14.459
I think this is probably one
of my most beautiful plates
I've put together.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.127
I've never cooked with hamachi,

33:16.161 --> 33:17.295
but it's one
of my favorite fishes.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.030
I wanna show the judges

33:19.064 --> 33:20.966
that I'm not gonna be
intimidated by new ingredients.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.500
Describe the dish, please.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.469
So it's a spice-crusted
pan-seared hamachi

33:24.502 --> 33:28.073
with a beet puree,
a kale fritter,

33:28.106 --> 33:30.341
and then some
sautéed mushrooms.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.510
The hamachi,
how do you think
it should be cooked?

33:32.544 --> 33:34.345
Like a tuna,
rare to medium rare.

33:34.379 --> 33:36.014
So you did crisp up
the skin separately

33:36.047 --> 33:37.248
or just kinda fell off
on its own like that?

33:37.282 --> 33:38.750
No, no, no.
I crisped it up separately,

33:38.784 --> 33:40.719
just so it gives that
little bit of texture element.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.821
So, you're confident it's gonna
be rare when I cut this open?

33:42.854 --> 33:44.590
Yes.

33:47.092 --> 33:49.027
It's cooked okay.

33:54.465 --> 33:57.102
The biggest thing
that you have going for you
on this is texture.

33:57.135 --> 33:59.437
You have it here
by way of this fritter,

33:59.470 --> 34:01.773
and then you have it
by way of the skin.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.508
But here's the deal
with the flaws.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.578
That beet puree is
so off-putting,

34:06.612 --> 34:11.116
it's marring any of
the other positive attributes
that this dish has.

34:11.149 --> 34:12.584
It's muddy.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.385
It's earthy
in a bad way.

34:14.419 --> 34:16.354
It's just falling flat.

34:16.387 --> 34:19.591
You have my pin
and that right there
is a disappointment.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.059
I understand, Chef.

34:25.631 --> 34:27.599
He said it was cooked okay.

34:27.633 --> 34:30.001
I disagree. I think
this is overcooked for me.

34:32.470 --> 34:34.740
There are rules
in the kitchen,

34:34.773 --> 34:37.442
and there are standards
that we all live by

34:37.475 --> 34:38.977
as professionals
in this business.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.446
When we're down
to seven cooks
on "MasterChef,"

34:41.479 --> 34:44.049
we expect you guys
to be playing
by those rules.

34:44.082 --> 34:47.485
And there's a couple
of cardinal rules
that you broke.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.989
Number one,
8 million different ways
to make beets.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.724
Pureeing them is not one.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.560
It's fibrous,
it will never be smooth.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.562
It will never be pleasing
on your palate.

34:57.595 --> 35:02.734
Secondly, hamachi is to be
treated exactly like tuna is.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.671
Seasoned on the outside,
seared, served rare.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.572
When's the last time
you got a medium

35:07.605 --> 35:09.507
or medium-well-cooked tuna?

35:09.540 --> 35:10.776
Never.

35:14.545 --> 35:16.514
Man, I'm feeling really
defeated right now.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.350
I felt so confident
about my dish when I finished,

35:19.384 --> 35:21.787
and to be so far off the mark,
it's disappointing.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.521
Last up, Samantha.

35:23.554 --> 35:26.424
The sear on my steak
looks amazing,

35:26.457 --> 35:28.293
but the temperature needs
to be perfect.

35:28.326 --> 35:29.961
We are the top seven,

35:29.995 --> 35:31.863
and I'm up against some
tough competition,

35:31.897 --> 35:33.832
so if I screw this up,

35:33.865 --> 35:36.501
- I could be going home tonight.
- Describe the dish, please.

35:36.534 --> 35:38.369
Today I have
a pan-seared rib eye

35:38.403 --> 35:43.775
with a mushroom cream sauce
and a carrot vinaigrette slaw.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.778
- Why rib eye?
- I don't cook steak
like this often,

35:46.812 --> 35:48.880
because a college student--
I can't afford it.

35:48.914 --> 35:52.350
So, I wanted to push myself
out of my comfort zone
with the rib eye tonight.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.619
- Temperature,
what we got in there?
- I'm hoping medium rare.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.955
Let's get in there,
shall we?

35:56.988 --> 35:58.857
So you said medium rare.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.391
I'm hoping.

36:00.425 --> 36:03.028
And...

36:03.061 --> 36:04.730
Oh, my Lord.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.539
- Temperature,
what we got in there?
- I'm hoping medium rare.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.007
Let's get in there,
shall we?

36:18.009 --> 36:20.812
And...

36:20.846 --> 36:22.513
Oh, my Lord.

36:24.549 --> 36:27.352
That is a perfect
medium rare.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.187
- ( exhales )
- ( whistles )

36:29.220 --> 36:30.722
- Samantha: It's beautiful.
- Gerron, come on.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.590
It's glistening.
I can see it from here.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.559
Great sear.
What was the rub?
What was the seasoning?

36:34.592 --> 36:38.396
Just salt and pepper,
and then I used the drippings
from the rib eye,

36:38.429 --> 36:40.365
heavy cream,
and those beautiful mushrooms

36:40.398 --> 36:41.933
to give that earthiness.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.701
- Delicious.
Let's get that right.
- Thank you.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.536
You absolutely nailed
the temperature.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.672
- Sauce is delicious.
Just be careful.
- Thank you.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.407
- You got that amount
of acidity with the cream.
- Yeah.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.342
It just separates immediately.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.578
- Mm-hmm. Yes, Chef.
- Now, will you just do me
a favor?

36:53.611 --> 36:55.680
- Flick your hair.
So Joe and Aarón can see
- Oh.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.883
- whose pin you're wearing.
- ( laughs )

36:57.916 --> 37:00.618
- Great job. Well done.
Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.420
I am bounding with joy
right now.

37:02.453 --> 37:04.455
I'm proving a lot even being
in this competition,

37:04.489 --> 37:06.758
but to make it to the top seven

37:06.792 --> 37:09.560
and then perform that well
under that much pressure.

37:09.594 --> 37:10.896
Yeah, I'll be
on that balcony tonight.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.731
( whispers )
Oh, wow!

37:13.765 --> 37:17.869
This challenge was all
about celebrating the beauty

37:17.903 --> 37:19.704
of great ingredients.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.439
And, unfortunately,

37:21.472 --> 37:26.377
one of you will be going home
this evening.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.379
Let's get one thing clear.

37:28.413 --> 37:33.985
Three of you tonight definitely
made restaurant-worthy dishes.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.721
Samantha,

37:36.754 --> 37:41.326
- Bowen, and Ashley.
- Thank you, Chef.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.295
Join those two up
on the balcony.

37:44.329 --> 37:45.763
Thank you.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.465
Whenever I'm fighting
for my life

37:47.498 --> 37:51.569
or it's a pressure filled
challenge, I shine.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.471
I feed off of it.

37:53.504 --> 37:56.407
I am here in the top six.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.443
- Ooh, goodness!
- Julia and Farhan,

37:58.476 --> 38:00.578
please, both of you,
make your way down to the front.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.348
Thank you.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.520
Farhan, Julia,

38:09.554 --> 38:12.757
you know, two home cooks
from Chicago,

38:12.790 --> 38:16.294
both mentored by Aarón.

38:16.327 --> 38:19.330
- ( Julia exhales )
- I'm invested in both of you.

38:19.364 --> 38:22.700
I'm trying to impart
my sensibility, my experience,

38:22.733 --> 38:25.636
my way of viewing ingredients
and treating them with respect,

38:25.670 --> 38:28.874
and the obvious is
that this evening

38:28.907 --> 38:31.642
was a rough ride
for both of you.

38:31.676 --> 38:36.547
Unfortunately, the time has come
and somebody has to go home.

38:36.581 --> 38:40.051
When I call your name, please,
take a step forward.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.922
Farhan.

38:47.725 --> 38:53.531
You know that performance
was not your finest hour.

38:53.564 --> 38:57.035
- No, it wasn't.
- Farhan...

38:57.068 --> 38:59.938
...undo your apron.

39:01.839 --> 39:05.576
And, Farhan,
do it up tighter,

39:05.610 --> 39:07.678
and get your act together.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.481
Your time is not done here.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.485
You, young man,
were literally a millimeter

39:14.519 --> 39:16.387
from leaving the competition.

39:16.421 --> 39:18.423
Head upstairs.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.666
I'm feeling so relieved.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.501
I can't believe I'm staying.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.503
I'm gonna really step it up
and show the judges

39:32.537 --> 39:34.572
that I can learn
from my mistakes, adapt,

39:34.605 --> 39:36.574
and be a better chef
because of it.

39:36.607 --> 39:40.912
Oh, Julia,
your chicken looking bland

39:40.946 --> 39:44.449
and uncared for was
the big shock for me.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.684
I've admired what you've done.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.520
I loved the way you've stood out
in team challenges,

39:49.554 --> 39:51.422
but continue that journey.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.959
Please do not stop.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.526
Yes, Chef.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.528
Promise.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.531
Julia, I want you to know I do
not regret giving you a pin.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.434
You showed such courage
through this process.

40:03.468 --> 40:04.635
People look up to you.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.372
So, please keep
your head up high,

40:07.405 --> 40:08.539
and go back to Chicago
and kick ass.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.441
- Okay.
- Come on up.

40:12.477 --> 40:14.445
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:14.479 --> 40:15.713
Bye-bye.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.949
Thank you.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.750
Good luck, Julia.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.052
Gordon:
Thank you, my darling.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.387
Please, place your apron
on your bench,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.455
and have a safe
journey home.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.057
Julia.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.825
Farhan:
Love you, Julia.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.333
My MasterChef journey
has been so amazing.

40:35.366 --> 40:38.403
I found my voice
in the MasterChef kitchen.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.506
I mean, come on, I won five
team challenges out of five.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.441
This Italian girl from Chicago,

40:43.474 --> 40:46.011
she's gonna be around
for a really long time.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.980
You think that just
because I got eliminated,
I'm gonna stop cooking?

40:49.014 --> 40:51.782
Forget about it.
You're crazy.

40:53.851 --> 40:56.087
Take a look at each other.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.423
There's only six of you left.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.757
With Julia being eliminated,

40:59.790 --> 41:01.592
Gordon has three,
Aarón has two,

41:01.626 --> 41:03.361
and Joe has one apron left.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.431
It feels amazing
to be in the final three

41:06.464 --> 41:08.466
of Gordon's mentees.

41:08.499 --> 41:10.135
We have got to stay strong,

41:10.168 --> 41:12.003
because it could be all three
of us in that finale.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.504
Gordon:
Get some sleep.

41:13.538 --> 41:14.939
You're gonna need it.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.307
Good night.

41:16.341 --> 41:17.808
Home cooks:
Good night, Chef.

41:22.347 --> 41:24.682
Narrator:
Next time on "MasterChef"...

41:24.715 --> 41:27.018
Four covers, table one.
Two New York strip, two duck.

41:27.052 --> 41:28.819
Home cooks:
Yes, Chef.

41:28.853 --> 41:32.057
...the top six take over
a world-class restaurant.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.492
- Can you do these?
I'm shaking too much.
- Oh, dear.

41:34.525 --> 41:37.328
- Home cooks...
- Touch that scallop.
It's ice cold!

41:37.362 --> 41:39.864
...working a two Michelin-star
restaurant.

41:39.897 --> 41:42.200
The duck is overcooked.
This is a joke!

41:42.233 --> 41:45.036
- What could go wrong?
- I got tables that are ready
to walk out.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.038
- I need plates.
- I need the scallops!

41:47.072 --> 41:48.873
- Speed it up, okay?
- I'm speeding it up.

41:48.906 --> 41:50.241
- Come on, season it!
- Come on!

41:50.275 --> 41:52.543
I need the food!
Come on!

41:59.250 --> 42:01.252
You've just taken a bite
out of MasterChef.
