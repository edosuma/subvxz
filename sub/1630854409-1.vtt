00:30.946 --> 00:32.946
Oh, my stomach hurts.

00:32.948 --> 00:35.249
I feel like
I got gas or something.

00:35.251 --> 00:36.883
No! No!

00:36.885 --> 00:38.352
This ain't gas!

00:38.354 --> 00:40.488
W-W-What's happening to me?!

00:41.690 --> 00:43.690
Who wants to party?!

00:43.692 --> 00:45.493
Carl looks like
he needs a hug.

00:45.495 --> 00:46.759
Meatwad,
that's not Carl.

00:46.761 --> 00:48.329
It's John Carpenter's
"The Thingamajig."

00:48.331 --> 00:51.534
And if you hug it, it will hug
you back until you are dead.

00:52.201 --> 00:55.001
<i>Commence self-destruct</i>
<i>mode in T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

00:55.003 --> 00:57.138
Get in your suits! Hurry!
But, Shake,

00:57.140 --> 01:00.006
what about you?
Just get your ass
in that Escape Cup.

01:00.008 --> 01:02.176
I'm never gonna get laid again!

01:02.178 --> 01:04.944
I don't need no instructions
to know how to ride!

01:04.946 --> 01:06.247
Look at my freaking body!

01:06.249 --> 01:08.915
I brought enough
lasers for everybody.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.417
Oh, that don't matter.

01:10.419 --> 01:11.684
None of this matters.

01:11.686 --> 01:13.855
Yeah! Aah!

01:17.560 --> 01:18.758
Come here!

01:18.760 --> 01:20.294
Ahh! Damn it!
He's got me.

01:20.296 --> 01:23.997
Lay off the French fries,
Fat Stuff!

01:23.999 --> 01:26.133
What, ya --
What, ya steppin' to me?

01:26.135 --> 01:28.171
I know you wasn't
talking to me.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.311
Let's do this!
Yeah!

01:36.313 --> 01:39.314
Maybe you need to lose
some weight, Carl...

01:39.316 --> 01:41.050
in the head region.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.156
Where did Carl go?

01:48.158 --> 01:50.057
And all his --
Were those his cousins?

01:50.059 --> 01:52.726
Carl was never
an official Aqua Teen,

01:52.728 --> 01:54.728
just a try-hard wannabe.

01:54.730 --> 01:58.368
But us, we're O.G.
Aqua Teen Forever.

01:59.269 --> 02:01.936
Shake's right, Meatwad.
We stick together always.

02:01.938 --> 02:03.171
Buckle up, gang.
<i>T-minus 20 seconds.</i>

02:03.173 --> 02:05.407
But there's only room
for two in here.

02:05.409 --> 02:06.907
<i>20...19...</i>

02:06.909 --> 02:08.809
This was always a one-way trip
for me.
<i>...18, 17...</i>

02:08.811 --> 02:10.711
Shake, no!
We can fit you in the cupholder.
<i>...16, 15...</i>

02:10.713 --> 02:13.148
I thought we was
gonna be together.
<i>...14, 13...</i>

02:13.150 --> 02:15.916
Aqua Teen Forever.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.485
Nothing lasts forever.
<i>...12, 11...</i>

02:17.487 --> 02:19.254
Initiate the launch.

02:19.256 --> 02:21.289
Sayonara, guys.
Say hi to Earth for me.
<i>...10, 9, 8...</i>

02:21.291 --> 02:23.325
We'll never forget you, Shake.
<i>...7...</i>

02:23.327 --> 02:25.360
And when you get down there,
tell my wife I love her.
<i>...6, 5...</i>

02:25.362 --> 02:27.761
Okay, man. We gotta go.
Push the launch button, please.
<i>...4, 3...</i>

02:27.763 --> 02:29.997
And I want you to give
that big blue marble...
<i>...2...</i>

02:29.999 --> 02:31.399
...a little kiss for me.
<i>...1...</i>

02:31.401 --> 02:32.935
Push the damn button or --

02:36.939 --> 02:38.473
And now I'm homeless.

02:38.475 --> 02:41.376
Can you believe how this country
treats our space heroes?

02:41.378 --> 02:44.878
So you survived
when the ship self-destructed?

02:44.880 --> 02:46.181
I'm standing here,
aren't I?

02:46.183 --> 02:48.849
What part of time travel
do you not understand?

02:48.851 --> 02:50.951
Where's the rest of
your Aqua Teens?

02:50.953 --> 02:52.287
I said they're dead,

02:52.289 --> 02:55.022
even though I did fight
valiantly to save them.

02:55.024 --> 02:56.391
That's how heroic I am.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.727
Saving dicks who don't even
appreciate me.

02:58.729 --> 03:00.495
They exist only
on this tattoo,

03:00.497 --> 03:03.931
which I'm getting changed
to say "Aqua Teen Never"

03:03.933 --> 03:06.501
because that's cheaper
than getting it removed.

03:06.503 --> 03:08.169
Why Aqua Teen?

03:08.171 --> 03:09.638
You seem
way older than a teenage --

03:09.640 --> 03:11.139
I'm well into
my late 40s.

03:11.141 --> 03:12.806
What is this?
A press conference?

03:12.808 --> 03:15.243

You're three minutes in,
and the Mooninites

04:23.113 --> 04:25.247
have already
hijacked your movie.

04:25.249 --> 04:27.383
And if you ever want to see
your movie alive again, bitch,

04:27.385 --> 04:32.053
you will text ERRIZDAMAN
to ERRULZ (377859).

04:32.055 --> 04:35.157
Errulz?
What gibberish is this?

04:35.159 --> 04:37.159
It's my agenda.
It's not even
spelled right.

04:37.161 --> 04:39.228
Err does rule.
You didn't think to ask me

04:39.230 --> 04:42.465
before you made "ERRULZ"
our ransom text line?

04:42.467 --> 04:44.467
Man, I must have been so drunk
when I did it.

04:44.469 --> 04:49.338
Text "ERRIZDAMAN" -- one word --
and then check your phone.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.841
Whoops!
And now we've
hijacked your phone.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.175
Ha ha ha!
That's right.

04:53.177 --> 04:55.076
We dominate
both your screens.

04:55.078 --> 04:56.512
We are everywhere
at once!

04:56.514 --> 04:59.648
The Mooninites control
all your wireless devices,

04:59.650 --> 05:02.118
including
your remote control...
Don't touch it.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.854
...which we control
remotely...
I said, don't touch it!

05:04.856 --> 05:06.455
...with a separate
remote control.

05:06.457 --> 05:09.861
We're digital.
And we have
one more digit for you.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.728
Drop to your knees
and feast upon it.

05:12.730 --> 05:16.134
'Cause this is your food.
Let it nourish you.

05:17.535 --> 05:20.436
What else can we say
to offend, Err?

05:20.438 --> 05:22.471
I don't know, man.
Kind of running out of stuff.

05:22.473 --> 05:25.307
We're going to come up
with some other wicked barbs

05:25.309 --> 05:27.443
to berate you with,
but until then,

05:27.445 --> 05:30.813
choke on your pathetic excuse
for entertainment.

05:30.815 --> 05:33.081
You just wasted $3.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.818
No, it's $19.99.
What? For this?

05:35.820 --> 05:38.019
Robbery!
No, this is nothing

05:38.021 --> 05:39.722
but a pathetic cash grab.

05:39.724 --> 05:41.325
Theaters rejected it.

05:42.627 --> 05:45.294
Yah! Whoo! Yah!

05:45.296 --> 05:48.664
Whoa, Billy! Whoa, Jenny!
Whoa, Bobby!

05:48.666 --> 05:49.998
Turn right, Lucy.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.067
Turn right, Billy.
Turn right, Other Bobby.

05:54.739 --> 05:57.306
Okay, don't everybody
love on me at once.

05:57.308 --> 05:59.708
Meatwad, we don't need
any more dogs.

05:59.710 --> 06:02.010
Ouch, Billy. Ouch, Bobby.

06:02.012 --> 06:03.846
Ouch, Other Bobby.
Now, that hurts.

06:03.848 --> 06:05.079
We're running
out of space.

06:05.081 --> 06:06.948
And judging by
some of these tags,

06:06.950 --> 06:09.351
did you steal these dogs
from dog owners?

06:09.353 --> 06:10.686
I just love me some dogs.

06:10.688 --> 06:13.088
My emotions run very high
when I see them.

06:13.090 --> 06:15.324
And, well, it often
clouds my judgment.

06:15.326 --> 06:18.127
Yeah, they love you, too,
but in a different way.

06:18.129 --> 06:19.361
Ow!
Down, boy!

06:19.363 --> 06:20.729
I'm getting in
good shape working here.

06:20.731 --> 06:22.865
I lost 20 pounds just last week.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.133
Ouch!
Down!

06:24.135 --> 06:26.735
Liz, you should go home
and take a load off.

06:26.737 --> 06:28.069
Give them dogs a rest.

06:28.071 --> 06:29.438
I'm talking about
your feetsies, now.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.941
You lock up every night,
Meatwad.

06:31.943 --> 06:36.145
I feel bad asking this, but
you're not living here, are you?

06:36.147 --> 06:39.181
No! Lord, no.
Oh, good.

06:39.183 --> 06:41.917
This is an animal shelter,
Liz.

06:41.919 --> 06:44.153
I'm a man.
Come on, now.

06:44.155 --> 06:45.454
Here are the keys.

06:45.456 --> 06:47.723
Oh! I feel so guilty
making you lock up again.

06:47.725 --> 06:51.827
Guilty enough that, uh, maybe I
crash with you for a few weeks

06:51.829 --> 06:53.696
at your apartment,
with the food and all?

06:53.698 --> 06:55.029
No, no.

06:55.031 --> 06:56.499
Not that kind of guilt.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.567
The kind of guilt where you
say it but you don't mean it

06:58.569 --> 06:59.768
or feel it.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.035
Why do you ask?

07:01.037 --> 07:02.605
No reason whatsoever.

07:02.607 --> 07:04.673
I got me a big house
to live in.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.142
Two cool roommates, too.
You've seen my tattoo.

07:07.144 --> 07:09.912
Aqua Teen Forever, baby.

07:09.914 --> 07:11.180
Frylock, Master Shake.

07:11.182 --> 07:14.015
These here are my homeboys.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.218
Listen to me prattle on.

07:16.220 --> 07:18.522
See ya later.

07:39.076 --> 07:41.678
We got goblins?
Huge ones.
You haven't heard them?

07:41.680 --> 07:43.880
Shake, ain't no goddamn goblins
in here, man.

07:43.882 --> 07:45.715
And now you curse
in front of him.

07:45.717 --> 07:48.785
Is it any wonder why Meatwad's
so up?

07:48.787 --> 07:51.123
You ass asshole.

07:52.157 --> 07:55.392
Ugh.

07:55.394 --> 07:58.028
"Dongle."

07:58.030 --> 08:00.297
Where's my computer?
I sold it.

08:00.299 --> 08:01.731
Had to buy
the Halloween costumes.

08:01.733 --> 08:03.433
Boo. I'm Macaroni Man.

08:03.435 --> 08:05.201
Okay, his is not
the good one.

08:05.203 --> 08:07.971
I had the cure for cancer
on that hard drive, Shake.

08:07.973 --> 08:11.975
But when I win, we use the money
to buy your computer back.

08:11.977 --> 08:14.311
'Course, I got to split the
winnings with these other guys.

08:14.313 --> 08:16.546
Yeah.
Nice!

08:16.548 --> 08:18.915
Big man.

08:21.053 --> 08:23.553
Unh-unh, unh-unh.

08:23.555 --> 08:24.721
Meatwad, let go.

08:24.723 --> 08:27.724
But who's gonna feed me
and help me say my prayers

08:27.726 --> 08:28.725
and tuck me in at night?

08:28.727 --> 08:30.527
You got to let go
of me, please.

08:30.529 --> 08:32.596
Frylock, you're not leaving.

08:32.598 --> 08:34.998
I'm the leader
and I'm telling you,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.199
you're not going anywhere.

08:36.201 --> 08:37.801
Yeah, walk it off.

08:37.803 --> 08:40.136
You'll be back...
by -- by the end of the month

08:40.138 --> 08:41.771
to pay the bills, right?

08:41.773 --> 08:46.409
Or I'll get evicted, and --
and that is not happening, son!

08:46.411 --> 08:48.445
You think
he heard any of that?

08:48.447 --> 08:49.913
Boo!
Macaroni Man.

08:49.915 --> 08:52.015
Still can't believe
you won that contest.

08:53.752 --> 08:55.752
<i>Next stop,</i>
<i>Amazin' headquarters,</i>

08:55.754 --> 08:57.654
<i>your one shop</i>
<i>for online shopping.</i>

08:57.656 --> 09:01.591
<i>When you go to work here,</i>
<i>you'll say, "It's Amazin'."</i>

09:11.269 --> 09:13.236
I soldered
all those motherboards,

09:13.238 --> 09:14.638
installed all
the spyware.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.373
Tickets are all clear.
Already?

09:16.375 --> 09:18.575
Damn, dude!
Hey, we get paid by the hour.

09:18.577 --> 09:20.510
You've got to move slower.

09:20.512 --> 09:22.779
They'll expect all of us
to be that fast.

09:22.781 --> 09:24.483
Ooh! New ticket.

09:26.351 --> 09:29.120
"Mouse needs new batteries"?

09:29.122 --> 09:30.520
Oh, man.
There you go.

09:30.522 --> 09:31.955
Go crush that one, superstar.

09:31.957 --> 09:33.857
It's up in the Llama Dolly?

09:35.360 --> 09:37.761
I've never been in there.

09:37.763 --> 09:41.264
Worked here eight years, never
set foot in the Llama Dolly.

09:41.266 --> 09:42.866
They say
it's a functional spaceship

09:42.868 --> 09:45.435
and everyone who built it
had their minds erased.

09:45.437 --> 09:48.705
The elevator only has
one button -- up.

09:48.707 --> 09:50.707
No one comes down.
No one.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.842
You heard of Neil?
He lives in there.

09:52.844 --> 09:54.044
Llama Dolly?

09:54.046 --> 09:55.512
Why don't they just call it
the Dalai Lama?

09:55.514 --> 09:57.814
She-shay-shush!
Never call it that.

09:57.816 --> 09:59.983
He named it that because
he did not want to insult

09:59.985 --> 10:01.818
his best friend,
His Holiness.

10:01.820 --> 10:03.353
He's friends with
the Dalai Lama?

10:03.355 --> 10:05.789
Don't say that!
There's microphones everywhere.

10:05.791 --> 10:09.859
And whatever you do, don't say
anything about his, you know.

10:09.861 --> 10:11.162
About his what?

10:11.164 --> 10:15.399
There's a rumor we,
of course, do not believe --

10:15.401 --> 10:18.905
right? -- that he's
4 inches tall.

10:21.141 --> 10:22.640
You sure you're
up for this, Phoenix?

10:22.642 --> 10:24.341
I lived with an
asshole for 15 years, man.

10:24.343 --> 10:25.609
I think I can handle Neil.

10:25.611 --> 10:27.678
Oh! We didn't
say he was an asshole,

10:27.680 --> 10:29.080
just that he's small
and he lives in

10:29.082 --> 10:30.681
a spaceship disguised
as an animal.

10:30.683 --> 10:32.316
Geez, some hang-ups
there, Phoenix.

10:32.318 --> 10:35.319
Is that a really real name?
Phoenix?

10:35.321 --> 10:36.954
Like the bird that
arose from the ashes?

10:36.956 --> 10:39.890
No, like the capital of Arizona.
What do you think?

10:39.892 --> 10:41.093
Okay, okay.

10:41.095 --> 10:42.560
Everyone give
Phoenix some space,

10:42.562 --> 10:44.061
'cause that's definitely
his real name.

10:44.063 --> 10:46.697
Dude, for what it's worth,
I do think it's a cool name.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.414
Warriors!

11:03.416 --> 11:05.416
Come out and play-ay!

11:05.418 --> 11:06.817
That's right.

11:06.819 --> 11:10.188
I'm the Bloods and the Crips
all in one can.

11:15.394 --> 11:16.827
Boo!
Ah, damn it!

11:16.829 --> 11:18.796
Where'd you come from?
The roof.

11:18.798 --> 11:20.931
I thought you vampires
got to be invited in.

11:20.933 --> 11:22.600
Not when you own the place.

11:22.602 --> 11:25.002
Who invited <i>you</i> in?
It's condemned.

11:25.004 --> 11:27.239
I-I come in here
to chase off, uh,

11:27.241 --> 11:28.606
rival street gangs.
Oh.

11:28.608 --> 11:30.374
They just spray-painted
this and run off.

11:30.376 --> 11:32.543
"Animal magnetizm."

11:32.545 --> 11:35.479
"Scorpians ruuulez"
spelled wrong.

11:35.481 --> 11:37.081
I guess kids today
still like

11:37.083 --> 11:39.617
quality East German metal
from the '80s.

11:39.619 --> 11:42.019
But this house is
an eyesore, Markula.

11:42.021 --> 11:44.588
It's dragging down
my property values.

11:44.590 --> 11:46.724
Tell you what. I'm gonna
make you a generous offer,

11:46.726 --> 11:48.058
take this off your hands.

11:48.060 --> 11:51.428
So you can flip it?
I wasn't born yesterday.

11:51.430 --> 11:54.166
I was born
40,000 years ago.

11:54.168 --> 11:57.701
Okay. All right. You got me.
I'm old now, too.

11:57.703 --> 12:00.172
Slap a coat of paint on this,
and you're gonna be

12:00.174 --> 12:01.672
so friggin' rich, dude.

12:01.674 --> 12:04.276
Amazin's gobbling up
everything in the neighborhood.

12:04.278 --> 12:05.876
Yes! Yeah, boy!

12:05.878 --> 12:07.145
Yeeeeah!

12:07.147 --> 12:09.214
B-B-Boy-boy-boy-ba-boy!

12:09.216 --> 12:11.816
You remember them food freaks
living there?
Oh, yes.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.286
So many times I was like,
"I'm out. I'm done.

12:14.288 --> 12:17.421
And I rented to them
just to annoy you.

12:17.423 --> 12:19.423
All that time
being pissed off.

12:19.425 --> 12:21.992
That's why I'm bald --
not genetics, the anger.

12:21.994 --> 12:24.428
Hanging out with them,
it took years off my life.

12:24.430 --> 12:26.063
So did the asbestos,
probably.

12:26.065 --> 12:28.399
I never took it out
like the city told me.

12:29.869 --> 12:33.037
Living here is finally
gonna to pay off, brother.

12:33.039 --> 12:36.241
For once in my life,
happiness.
Hooray!

12:36.243 --> 12:38.509
True, genuine happiness!

12:38.511 --> 12:40.544
Come on, baby.
Stretch it harder, Neil.

12:40.546 --> 12:42.680
Ooh, you're growing taller.
I can see it.

12:42.682 --> 12:44.849
I can see you growing.
It's miraculous.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.618
Come on, crank it up, Neil.
Elongate yourself, Neil.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.819
Come on,
we're in that homestretch.

12:48.821 --> 12:50.188
Get it?
'Cause we're stretching.

12:50.190 --> 12:51.956
Hello? Someone call
about mouse batteries?

12:51.958 --> 12:53.557
Quick, grab that pen
and tape measure

12:53.559 --> 12:55.260
and meet me at the doorframe,
quickly, quickly, now!

12:55.262 --> 12:56.493
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Mark it.

12:56.495 --> 12:57.895
Mark it before I shrink.

12:57.897 --> 12:59.630
Uh, you want me
to put a date?
Yeah.

12:59.632 --> 13:02.366
It's pretty much the same as
last month and the month before.

13:02.368 --> 13:03.667
Impossible. Let me see.

13:03.669 --> 13:04.935
You marked
from the crown of my head?

13:04.937 --> 13:07.973
Yeah.
I knew it wasn't working, Elmer!

13:07.975 --> 13:09.643
Blip-Blop,
new doorframe now.

13:10.878 --> 13:13.044
You, fix this machine.
It's not working.

13:13.046 --> 13:15.348
That's why I called you.
Not mouse batteries. Okay?

13:15.350 --> 13:18.351
I'm not an idiot. Would an idiot
be able to build this company?

13:18.353 --> 13:21.220
This is what
a smart person does.

13:22.489 --> 13:23.688
Now I definitely
can't fix it.

13:23.690 --> 13:25.191
Do not speak a word
about this.

13:25.193 --> 13:27.692
Blip-Blop, pull up an NDA.
Here, sign this.

13:27.694 --> 13:30.329
You will go to jail if
you say anything about my size,

13:30.331 --> 13:32.030
which is perfect for
a man of my height.

13:32.032 --> 13:34.267
You're not that small.
I mean, I was told you were --

13:34.269 --> 13:35.500
4 inches tall?

13:35.502 --> 13:37.136
Elon Musk spread that rumor.

13:37.138 --> 13:38.371
He's nothing but a battery pimp

13:38.373 --> 13:39.938
who likes to have
sex with his batteries.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.773
Tell that to everyone you know.
Let's get that going.

13:41.775 --> 13:43.942
Blip-Blop,
new machine now.

13:43.944 --> 13:46.178
Do not drop it.
Do not drop it.

13:46.180 --> 13:49.414
D'oh!
Hum! Find my center.

13:49.416 --> 13:52.417
Hum! Breathe into my body,
out, release.

13:52.419 --> 13:54.786
Hum!

13:54.788 --> 13:58.056
Okay. Ha ha. Sorry.
It's been a rough morning.

13:58.058 --> 14:00.458
I'm usually way
taller than this. I'm Neil.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.460
Phoenix. You ain't gonna
get taller

14:02.462 --> 14:03.895
strapping yourself
to a rack.

14:03.897 --> 14:05.730
But you could clone yourself
and splice the DNA

14:05.732 --> 14:07.065
with a taller protein.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.402
Like steak? No, I'm vegan.
I don't eat steak.

14:09.404 --> 14:12.470
Are you aware that the
beef industry is responsible for

14:12.472 --> 14:15.274
over 30% if carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere?

14:15.276 --> 14:18.543
Or is it carbon monoxide?
Blip-Blop, which is the bad one?

14:18.545 --> 14:20.879
No, not at all like steak.
Oh. Great.

14:20.881 --> 14:22.881
I mean, of course,
it's a very complicated process.

14:22.883 --> 14:26.051
To clone me? Sure.
But two Neils. I like it.

14:26.053 --> 14:28.520
Do it, now. Blip-Blop,
make him do it now.

14:28.522 --> 14:29.754
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>I don't understand.</i>

14:29.756 --> 14:32.224
Aah!
DNA. You were talking.

14:32.226 --> 14:33.959
I rudely interrupted. Go!

14:33.961 --> 14:35.760
Look, it's risky.
I've done it before,

14:35.762 --> 14:37.330
but I've never quite got
the sequencing right...

14:37.332 --> 14:39.332
Sequencing right.
Sequencing right.

14:39.334 --> 14:40.598
Sequencing right.

14:43.003 --> 14:44.903
Whoa! Damn! It worked.
Yes!

14:44.905 --> 14:47.872
Ignore me now, women.
Toss me the rock.

14:47.874 --> 14:49.774
Wait a minute.
I'm the ball?

14:49.776 --> 14:52.111
What you say goes unheard.

14:52.113 --> 14:54.180
Why didn't everybody
just buy a ball?

14:54.182 --> 14:57.283
I call upon the power
of Grayskull...
Don't do this.

14:57.285 --> 14:59.818
...to dunk on Meatwad's ass.
Please don't do this.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.020
Vanilla Wonder!
Oh, this sucks.

15:03.458 --> 15:04.956
Aah! Oh!

15:04.958 --> 15:06.958
Shit, man,
I got the splice wrong.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.362
Whoa!
Look at your leg, dude.

15:09.364 --> 15:11.464
That is graphic
and funny.

15:11.466 --> 15:13.366
Foul! Charging on Carl!

15:13.368 --> 15:15.301
Huge, huge side effects.

15:15.303 --> 15:17.470
I need more research,
more experiments.

15:17.472 --> 15:19.438
But, in theory,
it should work.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.072
Well, maybe we
can make that happen.

15:21.074 --> 15:22.907
You down in I.T.,
rotting away?

15:22.909 --> 15:26.011
Been there a few months, been
crushing it, if I say so myself.

15:26.013 --> 15:27.746
Well, now you're
up here with me,

15:27.748 --> 15:28.980
making me taller.

15:28.982 --> 15:31.018
Let me show you the operation.

15:32.819 --> 15:35.388
This is it, the Llama Dolly.

15:35.390 --> 15:37.889
The Llama-dama-ding-dong!

15:37.891 --> 15:40.192
It's my bitching house
and nothing more,

15:40.194 --> 15:43.295
regardless of what anyone
or Elon Musk says.

15:43.297 --> 15:49.069
Well, you know, down in I.T.,
they said it might be, uh...

15:50.204 --> 15:52.371
...you know...

15:52.373 --> 15:54.072
spaceship.
Spaceship?
That's a boldface lie.

15:54.074 --> 15:55.774
Who told you that?
What are their names?

15:55.776 --> 15:58.210
Oh, I don't remember.
I just heard it around
the coffee machine.

15:58.212 --> 16:01.046
Well, that could narrow it down,
because not everybody
drinks coffee.

16:01.048 --> 16:03.183
Blip-Blop, establish
cross-referencing database

16:03.185 --> 16:06.018
of everyone who works in I.T.
with everyone who drinks coffee.

16:06.020 --> 16:07.620
You're talking to your hand,
Neil.

16:07.622 --> 16:09.191
I mean, you threw your phone.
Remember?

16:13.128 --> 16:15.462
Wow!

16:15.464 --> 16:17.663
Talking back on day one.

16:17.665 --> 16:19.065
You have your own opinions.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.634
You're not afraid to
speak your mind. I like it.

16:21.636 --> 16:25.037
But what I say into my hand
is none of your business.

16:25.039 --> 16:26.906
Sorry, man.
Won't happen again.

16:26.908 --> 16:29.509
No, it will not.
Scratch that database.

16:29.511 --> 16:31.811
This is my hand,
as we both know.

16:31.813 --> 16:33.513
Hanging up now.

16:33.515 --> 16:35.315
And here's
my fulfillment center,

16:35.317 --> 16:38.617
run entirely by Fraptackulans
and Japangaloids.

16:38.619 --> 16:41.887
They traveled the galaxy for the
opportunity to work here.

16:41.889 --> 16:43.223
I thought those two races
hated each other.

16:43.225 --> 16:45.791
They're mortal enemies,
but at Amazin',

16:45.793 --> 16:48.095
we're all one big happy family,
right, guys?

16:48.097 --> 16:50.830
If I slip on your
Japangaloid slime one more time,

16:50.832 --> 16:52.232
I'm speaking to
your supervisor.

16:52.234 --> 16:56.103
Ha ha! I <i>am</i> the supervisor,
Crap-tackulan.

16:56.105 --> 16:58.238
It is "Fraptackulan"
with an "F,"

16:58.240 --> 17:00.540
not "Craptackulan"
with a "C."

17:00.542 --> 17:02.242
And you know that.

17:02.244 --> 17:04.610
How's that feel?
You wanna go?!

17:04.612 --> 17:06.480
You like that, crap-man?!

17:06.482 --> 17:09.851
There they go again. Blip-Blop,
release the sub-mist.

17:11.652 --> 17:14.387
Weird. The hand works. Wow.

17:14.389 --> 17:17.857
I'm so sorry, man.
Oh, no.

17:17.859 --> 17:20.093
Your skin came off
when I hugged you.

17:20.095 --> 17:22.795
It's cool.
I molt like three times a day.

17:22.797 --> 17:24.897
All good. No worries.

17:24.899 --> 17:28.101
Is that sub-mist legal?
Sure smells good.

17:28.103 --> 17:29.536
It's like Xanax,
but it's free.

17:29.538 --> 17:32.771
People take that. Is that legal?
So many questions.

17:32.773 --> 17:37.110
My hiding machine -- in pieces!
It's ruined!

17:37.112 --> 17:39.879
And this is Elmer,
my head of R&D,

17:39.881 --> 17:42.948
Elmer is the gaping asshole
who thought that machine

17:42.950 --> 17:46.453
was gonna make me taller,
instead of making me madder.

17:46.455 --> 17:50.656
Sentient French-fried potatoes?
You're floating. How?

17:50.658 --> 17:52.259
Whoa! Okay, okay.
Easy, now, man.

17:52.261 --> 17:55.529
Is this jewel decorative or does
it serve practical purposes?

17:55.531 --> 17:57.297
Okay. Down, boy.

17:57.299 --> 18:00.333
Elmer's pretty bright,
just not socially stable.

18:00.335 --> 18:03.336
Don't you agree, Elmer,
that you're sweaty?

18:03.338 --> 18:05.238
What is this?

18:05.240 --> 18:07.307
Oh, that's peanut oil.
Of course.

18:07.309 --> 18:09.576
Aah!
Sorry, man.
I-I said back off.

18:09.578 --> 18:13.146
Light amplified by stimulated
emissions of radiation?

18:13.148 --> 18:15.115
We all know
what a laser is, Elmer.

18:15.117 --> 18:16.882
Martin Landau shot them
frequently

18:16.884 --> 18:18.920
on the moon base
in "Space: 1999."

18:19.854 --> 18:21.555
What are you growing there?

18:21.557 --> 18:24.291
Walk vines.

18:24.293 --> 18:26.195
Come to me.

18:28.130 --> 18:29.828
Vines?

18:29.830 --> 18:31.730
Show these men
what I've been working on.

18:31.732 --> 18:33.600
Why won't you come to me?

18:33.602 --> 18:34.867
I'm a friend.
You can open up to me.

18:34.869 --> 18:36.603
Yeah, he's trying to
teach the vines

18:36.605 --> 18:38.104
to respond to
verbal commands.

18:38.106 --> 18:39.738
I'll start.
How is your day going?

18:39.740 --> 18:41.274
But it ain't happening,
is it, Elmer?

18:41.276 --> 18:43.243
They're being
passive-aggressive.

18:43.245 --> 18:45.778
They refuse to learn.
And they're just plants, though.

18:45.780 --> 18:47.147
Bad vines!

18:47.149 --> 18:49.649
Listen, Elmer,
I have to cancel dinner tonight.

18:49.651 --> 18:51.151
Something came up.

18:51.153 --> 18:52.885
Phoenix, what do you have
going on tonight for dinner?

18:52.887 --> 18:54.554
Elmer just canceled.

18:54.556 --> 18:57.190
You said something came up.
Yeah, that's what I told <i>you.</i>

18:57.192 --> 18:59.893
I'm telling my new friend
something else, Elmer.

18:59.895 --> 19:01.895
I suppose
I'm free tonight.

19:01.897 --> 19:04.398
Dinner, me, you, my house,

19:04.400 --> 19:06.534
the Llama-dama-ding-dong!

19:06.536 --> 19:09.372
Tonight,
it's going down!

19:10.440 --> 19:12.939
You'll eat with me,
won't you, my seedlings?

19:12.941 --> 19:16.644
I've prepared a hot meal,
a fertilizer feast.

19:16.646 --> 19:18.713
What do you mean, "Did this come
out of your butt?"

19:18.715 --> 19:20.147
Of course it came from my butt.

19:20.149 --> 19:21.582
You know,
you liked it yesterday,

19:21.584 --> 19:23.850
so I'm not sure what
the big kick is here.

19:23.852 --> 19:27.787
And now for a little me time.

19:27.789 --> 19:29.523
Ooh! There we go.

19:29.525 --> 19:32.025
There she is. Mm!

19:32.027 --> 19:33.860
That's right, baby.
I'm looking at you.

19:33.862 --> 19:35.363
Carl!
Damn it!

19:35.365 --> 19:39.300
My brother from another mother!
Long time, no see!

19:39.302 --> 19:42.002
Hey, what are you doing
with your penis there?

19:42.004 --> 19:43.537
You're gonna break it
if you keep doing that.

19:43.539 --> 19:45.740
Don't look over there.
Just push through.

19:45.742 --> 19:48.041
Wow! Did they not
mention the pool?

19:48.043 --> 19:49.710
That's got to be
worth another 4 or 5K.

19:49.712 --> 19:51.178
He's right.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.847
I said Olympic-sized pool,
and it ain't on here.

19:53.849 --> 19:56.217
Getting soft here!
The moment's passed!

19:56.219 --> 19:58.286
I see you're still rockin'
them sweats.

19:58.288 --> 19:59.953
Neighborhood's looking great,
by the way.

19:59.955 --> 20:02.423
I told you me living here
would create value.

20:02.425 --> 20:04.858
Oh, yeah, good call.
I'll meet you at the door.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.763
What?

20:08.765 --> 20:10.930
Bring it in,
Carlito's Way.

20:10.932 --> 20:12.266
Oh, you reek.

20:12.268 --> 20:13.967
No, no, no.
We're not hugging here.

20:13.969 --> 20:15.869
Make it quick,
and then I'm calling the cops.

20:15.871 --> 20:18.205
Oh, whoa.
That is hurtful.

20:18.207 --> 20:19.674
I just wanted to check in
and see how you're doing.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.007
You know.
No.

20:21.009 --> 20:22.909
And I don't feel comfortable
under that bridge.

20:22.911 --> 20:24.345
No. Get your foot
out of there.

20:24.347 --> 20:25.780
No! No! Get --

20:25.782 --> 20:30.083
Okay, look, before you say no,
all I need is the three S's --

20:30.085 --> 20:32.988
shower, shit, and a sundae
with hot fudge.

20:33.556 --> 20:35.156
Don't you feel this, bro?

20:35.158 --> 20:37.857
Mmm! With me here,
it's a hang.

20:37.859 --> 20:39.427
Alright,
let's cut to the chase.

20:39.429 --> 20:41.629
You want to crash here
for free?

20:41.631 --> 20:43.197
Just a few months, Carl.

20:43.199 --> 20:45.533
It's so tough out there
for guys like me

20:45.535 --> 20:47.867
who don't want to have
anything to do with work.

20:47.869 --> 20:49.403
Don't --
Don't cry here.

20:49.405 --> 20:52.273
I know we got shared history
here. I ain't forgotten.

20:52.275 --> 20:55.778
I can probably make one room
available to you.

20:56.579 --> 21:00.181
It's a real cozy starter home.
Bigger than it looks, too.

21:00.183 --> 21:03.317
And look at that, huh?
It's got new windows put in.

21:03.319 --> 21:05.919
So, we gonna just put it
right in the living room or...?

21:05.921 --> 21:08.021
No, no, no.
We'll keep it back here

21:08.023 --> 21:10.224
where no one from the road
can see you.

21:10.226 --> 21:12.226
And don't you even
look at that pool.

21:12.228 --> 21:15.596
And where am I
going to shave?
Hey, this is what
I'm offering.

21:15.598 --> 21:17.798
If you don't like it,
you live with the Fry man.

21:19.034 --> 21:20.701
Frylock is dead to me.

21:20.703 --> 21:22.536
I'll never speak with him again,

21:22.538 --> 21:25.038
but I might want to
troll him via text,

21:25.040 --> 21:26.440
so I'd need
his new cell number.

21:26.442 --> 21:27.575
Do you have it?

21:27.577 --> 21:30.644
What up, Neil?
No, that sucks. Hey, Neil.

21:30.646 --> 21:32.847
I-I made my famous
strawberry shortcake.

21:32.849 --> 21:35.449
Short. Damn it. He'll think
I'm making fun of him.

21:35.451 --> 21:37.917
Stupid! Why didn't
I just bring wine?

21:37.919 --> 21:40.053
Nice jewel, French fry.

21:40.055 --> 21:41.856
It'd look a lot nicer
around my neck.

21:41.858 --> 21:44.091
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
See you later.

21:44.093 --> 21:45.326
It ain't a compliment.

21:45.328 --> 21:47.094
I want it.
Yeah, hash brown.

21:47.096 --> 21:48.396
Neil, Neil,
come on. Open the door.

21:48.398 --> 21:49.996
Neil! Help. Help!
Get your ass over here.

21:49.998 --> 21:52.367
Stab, stabby, stab.

21:52.369 --> 21:53.568
There it is.

21:53.570 --> 21:57.105
Hyah! Get out of here,
street toughs!

21:57.107 --> 21:59.543
Phoenix, no!

22:05.682 --> 22:08.583
Oh, come on. Come on.

22:08.585 --> 22:11.455
Frickin' lotionless.

22:16.326 --> 22:18.360
Aw, man.

22:18.362 --> 22:21.596
I bet it's cold out there.

22:23.767 --> 22:25.402
Damn it.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.704
Fire! Fire! Fire!

22:29.706 --> 22:31.139
Stop, drop, and roll!

22:31.141 --> 22:34.509
I'm like if the
Impractical Jokers had balls.

22:34.511 --> 22:36.812
What kind of joke
is that?

22:36.814 --> 22:38.012
Good one, Carl.

22:38.014 --> 22:39.381
What happened?

22:39.383 --> 22:41.149
It's okay. You're okay, Phoenix.
Don't get up.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.618
Cut, clarity, color.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.153
The geometry is perfect.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.622
My jewel. No, no.
It shouldn't be detached.

22:47.624 --> 22:49.524
I need that back.
Who would do this?

22:49.526 --> 22:52.194
We're investigating.
They left a clue.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.061
Strawberry shortcake.

22:54.063 --> 22:55.363
They obviously came
to make fun of me.

22:55.365 --> 22:57.232
Is that my box?
It's ripped to shreds!

22:57.234 --> 22:59.534
I'm disfigured!
Oh, my God.

22:59.536 --> 23:01.136
Look, I know
this was traumatic,

23:01.138 --> 23:02.904
but I have creepy Elmer
working on this

23:02.906 --> 23:05.474
and all of the resources
of my incredible company.

23:05.476 --> 23:08.510
Soon, you'll be a Phoenix
rising from the ashes.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.745
And not just that hot,
dry city in Arizona.

23:10.747 --> 23:12.814
Uh, no, thanks. I don't need to
go right now, man.

23:12.816 --> 23:14.749
It's not a bedpan.

23:14.751 --> 23:18.153
It's your new box that Neil
made me make for you.

23:18.155 --> 23:19.788
It's made of brotanium,

23:19.790 --> 23:22.791
the lightest-yet-strongest
material known to man.

23:22.793 --> 23:24.159
Look it up.

23:24.161 --> 23:26.361
It's stronger than anything
in the MCU,

23:26.363 --> 23:27.796
even stronger than vibranium,

23:27.798 --> 23:29.965
which we're allowed to say
but not show.

23:29.967 --> 23:31.299
Damn! For real?

23:31.301 --> 23:34.169
It's devised by Elmer
but named by me,

23:34.171 --> 23:36.438
because Elmernesium
is a dumb name.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.806
Don't we agree on that?
Yep.

23:37.808 --> 23:39.708
You're right 'cause you're
the boss and everything.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.942
I, like, suck.

23:40.944 --> 23:42.878
Here, let's see if it fits
around your brains.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.348
Hell yeah!

23:52.523 --> 23:54.890
I got these pits smelling
lemony-citrus

23:54.892 --> 23:56.658
and dishwasher-safe.

23:56.660 --> 24:00.097
And now, time to activate
the gravy.

24:00.931 --> 24:02.898
Oh. Yeah.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.666
Mmm! Mmm!

24:04.668 --> 24:06.735
Fish and egg and cheddar?

24:06.737 --> 24:09.104
Whoda thunk
they'd go well together?

24:09.106 --> 24:12.107
I'll tell you who.
The dogs here.

24:12.109 --> 24:14.376
Uh-oh. Oh, hey, Liz!

24:14.378 --> 24:15.744
So you <i>are</i> sleeping here.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.812
I'm not sleeping here
during the day.

24:17.814 --> 24:19.614
Come on, girl.

24:19.616 --> 24:20.849
Just at nighttime.

24:20.851 --> 24:22.450
I'm sorry, Meatwad.

24:22.452 --> 24:25.987
We're a charity, but our charity
only extends so far.
How far?

24:25.989 --> 24:27.756
Aah!

24:27.758 --> 24:31.693
Ugh! That's pretty far.
You got you a good arm, Liz.

24:31.695 --> 24:35.597
Good luck, Meatwad!
Please do not come back!

24:35.599 --> 24:38.934
I'm adding a really cool
bonus room, Carl.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.336
Hey, maybe I'll invite you over
for some air hockey later.

24:41.338 --> 24:43.471
Yeah. No, thanks.
Meat man. What's up?

24:43.473 --> 24:44.873
Hey, Carl.
How you doing?

24:44.875 --> 24:46.441
He's doing fine.
Can I help you?

24:46.443 --> 24:47.877
I was talking to Carl.

24:47.879 --> 24:50.580
And now you're talking to me.
And I'm here to tell you

24:50.582 --> 24:54.417
there is no room at the inn,
so just roll along, now.

24:54.419 --> 24:56.352
Bye-bye.
Shake, come on, man.

24:56.354 --> 24:58.754
Relax. We'll break ground
on another condo.

24:58.756 --> 25:01.123
You mean it, a place
of my very own?

25:01.125 --> 25:03.392
Just got another house
in the mail.

25:03.394 --> 25:06.462
Look, at this.
12 bedrooms.
Wow.

25:06.464 --> 25:10.132
Or you knock down these walls,
opens up the whole flow.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.101
Damn, Carl,
you're a real prince.

25:12.103 --> 25:13.669
Something's different with you,
man.

25:13.671 --> 25:16.973
I ain't never seen you
so not pissed off at the world.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.541
You noticed that?

25:18.543 --> 25:22.812
I used to sleep with my
hands balled in fists of rage.

25:22.814 --> 25:26.182
My knuckles were sore
from my angry dreams...

25:26.184 --> 25:27.683
because I lived
next to you.

25:27.685 --> 25:30.419
And now I got
a better outlook on life,

25:30.421 --> 25:32.254
'cause I'm about to
get paid, son.

25:35.259 --> 25:36.792
That's our old house,
ain't it?

25:36.794 --> 25:39.195
Yeah, that's where I barely
let you live.

25:39.197 --> 25:41.564
Who's ordering stuff
over here?

25:41.566 --> 25:44.900
Yeah, and laying those boxes
down in perfect rows.

25:44.902 --> 25:47.670
Like so many
ears of corn.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.172
Yeah, I already went through
them. They're all pretty empty.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.407
You grab what you want.

25:51.409 --> 25:53.342
But these ain't
addressed to you.

25:53.344 --> 25:54.744
And, yet, I received them.

25:54.746 --> 25:57.046
Alright, look,
here at Carl Acres,

25:57.048 --> 25:58.681
taxes are pretty high.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.616
And they're assessed
weekly -- cash.

26:00.618 --> 26:02.685
A property tax?

26:02.687 --> 26:04.654
I took to the road
so I didn't have to

26:04.656 --> 26:06.255
deal with
such responsibilities.

26:06.257 --> 26:07.857
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

26:07.859 --> 26:10.926
Home ownership is a very
important part of owning a home.

26:10.928 --> 26:13.529
I hear that.
Now, if you're
gonna live here,

26:13.531 --> 26:17.066
you're gonna follow my rules
and you're gonna earn.

26:17.068 --> 26:19.802
Okay, the sauna detoxifies,

26:19.804 --> 26:22.471
and the ice bath
freezes the toxins.

26:22.473 --> 26:23.706
Whoo, it's cold!

26:23.708 --> 26:25.608
Give me one more.
I'm not helping.

26:25.610 --> 26:27.943
You got this.

26:27.945 --> 26:29.146
Whoo!
Hey, down low.

26:29.148 --> 26:30.346
Oh, okay.

26:30.348 --> 26:31.714
Now back to the sauna,

26:31.716 --> 26:34.550
but only for a second,
then the ice bath again,

26:34.552 --> 26:36.185
and then the sauna again.

26:36.187 --> 26:37.820
Are we allowed
to use soap or...?

26:37.822 --> 26:40.523
Yes, but the soap is
infused with scorpions.

26:40.525 --> 26:43.459
Whatever doesn't kill you makes
you -- I don't remember.

26:43.461 --> 26:45.327
Quickly, bathe like I do.

26:45.329 --> 26:47.263
I look crazy, man.

26:47.265 --> 26:48.531
See?
The crazier you look,

26:48.533 --> 26:50.833
the smarter Wall Street
thinks you are.

26:50.835 --> 26:53.469
Ow. Ow, ow.
The venom glands
of the scorpion,

26:53.471 --> 26:55.172
they release toxins.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah.

26:55.174 --> 26:56.405
And do you know what
that means?

26:56.407 --> 26:57.740
Back to the sauna?
Yes.

26:57.742 --> 27:01.111
To detoxify.
You're learning, Phoenix.

27:01.113 --> 27:02.344
Aah!

27:02.346 --> 27:03.913
Ooh! Ooh!
Yeah.

27:03.915 --> 27:06.782
It's my private discotheque.
I don't even know why I own it.

27:06.784 --> 27:09.218
You're the first person I've
ever allowed to dance in here.

27:09.220 --> 27:10.419
You're pretty good.

27:10.421 --> 27:11.620
You're a good dancer,
too, Neil.

27:11.622 --> 27:14.590
Albino Bengal tiger.

27:14.592 --> 27:17.593
There's only eight of them
in the civilized world.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.863
And now there's seven.
Whoa! Neil, what the fuck?!

27:20.865 --> 27:23.499
Uh, I'm sorry.
Why did you do that?

27:23.501 --> 27:26.402
Did you not think that was cool,
me showcasing my power?

27:26.404 --> 27:27.837
Hell, no,
that's not cool, man.

27:27.839 --> 27:31.741
Oh, I am so sorry, Phoenix.
Please forgive me.

27:31.743 --> 27:34.243
I never valued
anyone's opinion before

27:34.245 --> 27:35.878
because mine
were so great.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.481
I'm just feeling
this vibe with us, man.

27:38.483 --> 27:39.915
It's okay, Neil.
It makes me crazy.

27:39.917 --> 27:43.154
I'm feeling the vibe, too.
But what about your tiger?

27:43.156 --> 27:44.387
Should we help
your tiger now?

27:44.389 --> 27:46.157
I don't know.
What do you think?

27:46.159 --> 27:47.991
See?
I asked your opinion.

27:47.993 --> 27:51.828
No more tiger shooting
because of what you said.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.797
My friend.

27:53.799 --> 27:55.432
Wait. Hold on.

28:03.575 --> 28:05.509
Yes. It's stable.
It's holding.

28:05.511 --> 28:08.945
Uh, my ankle's weakening!

28:10.150 --> 28:12.048
Wrong again.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.851
So sorry, Neil.
We're close. I know it.

28:14.853 --> 28:17.255
Hey, get back to the warehouse
and work.

28:17.257 --> 28:21.391
But how?
I don't know, but those boxes
don't deliver themselves.

28:21.393 --> 28:23.960
Not yet anyway.

28:23.962 --> 28:25.295
Elmer!

28:25.297 --> 28:28.665
Never open your mouth unless you
have something smart to say!

28:28.667 --> 28:30.300
Only Phoenix is the smart one!

28:30.302 --> 28:31.735
Guess I don't know
what I'm talking about,

28:31.737 --> 28:33.403
even though I constantly know
what I'm talking about.

28:33.405 --> 28:34.604
Neil, I just want
to thank you, man,

28:34.606 --> 28:35.806
for putting
your faith in me.

28:35.808 --> 28:37.440
For the first time
in my life,

28:37.442 --> 28:41.145
I feel valued,
respected, actually liked.

28:41.147 --> 28:43.147
I feel like
I have a friend.

28:43.149 --> 28:45.249
You do have
a friend, Phoenix.

28:45.251 --> 28:46.817
An amazin' friend.

28:46.819 --> 28:50.288
Here at Amazin',
we have amazin' products,

28:50.290 --> 28:51.988
amazin' deliveries,

28:51.990 --> 28:53.690
amazin' employees,

28:53.692 --> 28:56.860
<i>and amazin' employee bathrooms.</i>
Whoa! Was that Frylock?

28:56.862 --> 28:58.528
<i>And despite</i>
<i>what the media says,</i>

28:58.530 --> 29:00.864
<i>no one is forced to urinate</i>
<i>in a bottle</i>

29:00.866 --> 29:03.033
<i>unless they want to,</i>
<i>which they can</i>

29:03.035 --> 29:05.569
<i>because it's their God-given</i>
<i>right, and we support that.</i>

29:05.571 --> 29:07.003
<i>Right, Llama Dolly?</i>

29:08.373 --> 29:10.674
<i>When you get your</i>
<i>Amazin' shipment, you'll say...</i>

29:10.676 --> 29:12.976
<i>It's Amazin'!</i>

29:12.978 --> 29:15.946
Dorks. And that's where
we're working tonight,

29:15.948 --> 29:18.448
earning your keep.
I hear it's fun over there.

29:18.450 --> 29:19.783
I miss being part
of a team.

29:19.785 --> 29:21.185
Y'all remember
Aqua Teen?

29:21.187 --> 29:24.222
No, we ain't working for that
Neil bloodsucker.

29:24.224 --> 29:27.023
Half his employees are on
food stamps, pissing in bottles.

29:27.025 --> 29:29.626
Yeah, my cousin's a teamster,
told me all about it.

29:29.628 --> 29:33.463
And he's hiring us to visit
with Amazin' employees

29:33.465 --> 29:36.202
and show them the benefits
of being in a union.

29:36.802 --> 29:38.935
Yeah!
Carl, what are you doing?

29:38.937 --> 29:40.937
Smashing a window.

29:40.939 --> 29:43.207
And then we put these
pro-union leaflets

29:43.209 --> 29:44.507
inside the smashed windows?

29:44.509 --> 29:46.476
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We're like influencers.

29:46.478 --> 29:49.282
And this pipe
is our social media.

29:50.048 --> 29:52.883
Sorry about your tire.
Join a union.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.518
Did we already
do this one?

29:55.520 --> 29:56.853
Oh, are you kidding me?

29:56.855 --> 29:58.889
Someone double-booked
the event?

29:58.891 --> 30:01.024
Look at this.
They missed the taillights.

30:01.026 --> 30:02.826
Amateurs.
Please don't, sir, okay?

30:02.828 --> 30:04.427
Those gentleman over there

30:04.429 --> 30:07.831
already spoke to me
about <i>not</i> joining the union.

30:07.833 --> 30:10.800
Okay, fine!
I like my shitty wages!

30:10.802 --> 30:13.003
Goons
hired by the company.

30:13.005 --> 30:15.373
No, we're goons hired
to show you

30:15.375 --> 30:17.407
the benefits
of joining a union

30:17.409 --> 30:20.443
so actions like this
would stop.

30:20.445 --> 30:21.945
Would the union give us
enough money

30:21.947 --> 30:24.282
to find a decent place to live
that isn't a car?

30:24.284 --> 30:25.815
You ain't got nowheres
to live?

30:25.817 --> 30:28.618
Friends,
we did not come here by choice.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.187
Many moltons ago,

30:30.189 --> 30:33.157
our home planet of Japango
was a paradise,

30:33.159 --> 30:34.824
until Neil arrived.

30:34.826 --> 30:38.629
He offered us good jobs on Earth
with low pay and zero benefits.

30:38.631 --> 30:40.365
Well, that certainly
didn't add up.

30:40.367 --> 30:41.666
Want to set your own hours

30:41.668 --> 30:43.634
and make six figures
working from home?

30:43.636 --> 30:47.872
Of course you don't.
You're too lazy to want success.

30:47.874 --> 30:50.409
Come work for me,
where I dictate the terms.

30:50.411 --> 30:52.311
Of course we refused him.

30:52.313 --> 30:54.979
So he pushed our planet
closer to our sun,

30:54.981 --> 30:58.616
cackling as our crops burned and
our slime reservoirs evaporated.

30:58.618 --> 31:00.118
So come on, gang,

31:00.120 --> 31:02.387
who wants to be part of
the Amazin' success story?

31:02.389 --> 31:03.888
You do.

31:03.890 --> 31:06.724
So let's roll up our sleeves
and get down to business,

31:06.726 --> 31:07.992
or you're dead.

31:07.994 --> 31:10.162
We will never surrender
to you, Neil.

31:10.164 --> 31:12.132
And then he released
the sub-mist.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.968
Sounds like a plan, Neil.
When do we start?

31:16.970 --> 31:18.669
We boarded
the Llama Dolly en masse

31:18.671 --> 31:20.671
after paying Neil's ridiculous

31:20.673 --> 31:23.641
moving charges
and resettlement fees.

31:23.643 --> 31:25.943
The whole trip to Earth
was a blur.

31:25.945 --> 31:27.845
And now we're wedged
in a warehouse,

31:27.847 --> 31:30.315
elbow-to-elbow with
Craptackulans

31:30.317 --> 31:33.050
Not to be racist, but they're
the shittiest race in space.

31:33.052 --> 31:35.454
Oh, go blow it out
your bing-bong hole!

31:35.456 --> 31:37.822
The bing-bong hole
is not for waste.

31:37.824 --> 31:41.659
It's a pleasure center
and nutrient port.

31:41.661 --> 31:43.728
I wouldn't touch you
with his moisture prongs.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.997
Keep molting
all over the parking lot.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.665
Not even the rats
will eat it,

31:47.667 --> 31:48.899
'cause you're nasty!

31:48.901 --> 31:51.370
If my ankle weren't
so rubbery,

31:51.372 --> 31:53.205
I would give you
such a kick!

31:53.207 --> 31:55.673
Show me what you got!
You would have a big bruise.

31:55.675 --> 31:56.974
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:56.976 --> 31:58.642
You got to get
over your differences

31:58.644 --> 31:59.944
and work together here.

31:59.946 --> 32:02.481
Union can get you good wages,
medical care

32:02.483 --> 32:06.251
for whatever that is making your
skin come off in big hunks

32:06.253 --> 32:07.752
and making you...

32:07.754 --> 32:10.222
Are you ejaculating, like,
all over your body?

32:10.224 --> 32:11.889
Weak ankles, huh?

32:11.891 --> 32:13.291
Man, I've been there.
Don't.

32:13.293 --> 32:16.294
I used to dominate these streets
with the round ball,

32:16.296 --> 32:18.497
then I blew out
my one thick ankle.
Stop, please.

32:18.499 --> 32:21.133
Thanks to French fry's
little experiment.
Ow, don't.

32:21.135 --> 32:24.702
Wait. French fry?
Floating box of French fries?

32:24.704 --> 32:26.704
You know Meatwad?
You know Frylock?

32:26.706 --> 32:28.039
Sorry. I'm dizzy.

32:28.041 --> 32:31.075
Mm-hmm. We've seen him.
His name is Phoenix.

32:31.077 --> 32:33.211
He works
in the Llama Dolly.
He's the one
who maimed me.

32:33.213 --> 32:36.114
And he's good friends
with that asshole Neil.

32:36.116 --> 32:39.117
He calls himself Phoenix now?

32:39.119 --> 32:40.818
What kind of name
is Phoenix?

32:40.820 --> 32:43.321
Call him Franklin
French Frylock.

32:43.323 --> 32:45.790
That's his Christian name.
Call him that.

32:45.792 --> 32:47.591
Oh, he hates it.

32:47.593 --> 32:49.494
Of course
Frylock's an asshole.

32:49.496 --> 32:51.662
I lived with the man
for 15 years.

32:51.664 --> 32:54.732
He took care
of everything.

32:54.734 --> 32:56.867
Then he didn't give me
an ounce of credit.

32:56.869 --> 32:59.870
Yeah, well, the Frylock I know
cares about people.

32:59.872 --> 33:01.639
No, he doesn't.

33:01.641 --> 33:03.241
He's not like Carl.

33:03.243 --> 33:07.778
Carl gave us homes, dignity,
a place to hang our hats.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.381
Right, Carl?
Whoa, you ain't coming in here.

33:09.383 --> 33:12.551
No, I know that. I have a house
of my own, thanks to you.

33:12.553 --> 33:15.086
And you need to relocate it
because I don't want

33:15.088 --> 33:16.854
the grass getting brown
underneath.

33:16.856 --> 33:18.390
I'm watering tonight.

33:18.392 --> 33:20.858
Got to keep this lush
and green for the open house.

33:20.860 --> 33:23.694
Hope you got flood insurance.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.467
Aw, man.
I got to shut the bay window.

33:28.469 --> 33:29.867
My Foosball table!

33:29.869 --> 33:32.138
Between you and me,
I'm thinking of moving.

33:32.140 --> 33:35.640
Don't you move into my
neighborhood with your riffraff.

33:35.642 --> 33:37.709
And, uh, what's up
with the lawn?

33:37.711 --> 33:39.245
Are we ever gonna mow that?

33:39.247 --> 33:41.680
'Cause it's spilling over
onto my property line.

33:41.682 --> 33:43.048
I won't ask you again,
sir.

33:43.050 --> 33:44.517
I was about to tell you
the same thing.

33:44.519 --> 33:46.985
We have us a covenant here.
You got to keep with it.

33:46.987 --> 33:49.188
I'll get you written up.
Well, mine
is grandfathered in,

33:49.190 --> 33:52.258
but I'm afraid you're gonna
need to apply for a variance

33:52.260 --> 33:56.195
for all this overgrown brush
you seem to relish in.

33:56.197 --> 33:57.762
It's got my hand!
Meatwad, help!

33:57.764 --> 34:00.233
Form of a hot dog.
Form of an igloo.

34:00.235 --> 34:01.300
Meatwad!

34:01.302 --> 34:03.668
It don't respond to hot dogs
or igloos.

34:03.670 --> 34:05.871
Form into
a frickin' Weedwacker!

34:05.873 --> 34:08.976
Let me in, Carl!
Let me in!

34:10.010 --> 34:11.743
Oh, no, Err,
the movie's hanging up.

34:13.114 --> 34:16.115
How ever will they defeat
these mysterious plants?

34:16.117 --> 34:17.816
They'll never know.
That's right.

34:17.818 --> 34:19.285
You won't, stupid viewer,

34:19.287 --> 34:22.588
because we just dragged
the next scene to the trash.

34:22.590 --> 34:23.922
It's gone, sucker.

34:23.924 --> 34:26.392
Seven-plus minutes
of edge-of-your-seat,

34:26.394 --> 34:30.129
marginally animated
bone-throttling action

34:30.131 --> 34:32.365
deleted.
Gone forever. Ha ha ha!

34:32.367 --> 34:34.367
Empty trash, Err.
It's still in there.

34:34.369 --> 34:36.435
Okay.

34:36.437 --> 34:37.669
Gone-a-wrong-a-tong.

34:37.671 --> 34:39.671
Oh, do you want to
resume watching

34:39.673 --> 34:42.040
without the crucial information
we destroyed

34:42.042 --> 34:43.708
right in front
of your face?

34:43.710 --> 34:45.178
Dumbass.
You won't understand.

34:45.180 --> 34:47.113
You may as well be
watching "Tenet."

34:47.115 --> 34:49.282
You'll have to rent it again
if you can afford it.

34:49.284 --> 34:51.716
Good one, Err.
Implying they're poor.

34:51.718 --> 34:53.084
Impoverish-o.

34:53.086 --> 34:54.753
We'll let the movie
continue.

34:54.755 --> 34:56.955
But watch your back.

35:01.496 --> 35:04.829
Damn, man. Them plants chased us
all the way to Berlin,

35:04.831 --> 35:07.300
Reykjavik, and frickin'
Venice, Italy.

35:07.302 --> 35:08.334
But why?

35:08.336 --> 35:10.068
And that key that
the spy gave us,

35:10.070 --> 35:12.238
who we ended up finding dead
in your hotel room.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.906
How does it all connect?
You got to admit, though,

35:14.908 --> 35:17.075
that was
a pretty exciting chase.
Yeah, it was.

35:17.077 --> 35:19.044
Where did those frickin' plants
come from?

35:19.046 --> 35:20.446
Why do you think
I would know?

35:20.448 --> 35:22.548
Frylock's the one who does
the science stuff.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.748
You want me
to text him?

35:23.750 --> 35:25.218
He gave you his number?!

35:25.220 --> 35:27.253
When I asked,
he gave me the finger.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.621
We're back.

35:28.623 --> 35:30.889
You're welcome.
That's right,
stupid viewer.

35:30.891 --> 35:33.526
We deleted
this next scene, too.

35:33.528 --> 35:36.061
Forever.
You'll never see it
'cause it's gone.

35:36.063 --> 35:37.762
It sucked so hard
that I think

35:37.764 --> 35:38.997
we should have
made them watch it.

35:38.999 --> 35:41.066
Yes, it is a slow scene.

35:41.068 --> 35:43.034
They take in
some Renaissance art

35:43.036 --> 35:45.003
and fly back home
in real time.

35:45.005 --> 35:47.506
It really added nothing
productive to the story.

35:47.508 --> 35:50.176
Yeah, it's like watching
"The Irishman" on a loop, man.

35:50.178 --> 35:52.245
Well, someone
is a film buff.

35:52.247 --> 35:54.113
Got a problem with that?
The onion peels.

35:54.115 --> 35:55.615
So what? I like movies.

35:55.617 --> 35:58.551
Well, it's just -- it's just
very hard to disrupt the movie

35:58.553 --> 36:01.187
when you want to
constantly watch it, Err.

36:01.189 --> 36:03.088
You can see how
the optics are bad.
Yeah, I know.

36:03.090 --> 36:05.224
We should work together here.
Okay.

36:05.226 --> 36:07.460
Being assholes to the viewer,
not to each other.

36:07.462 --> 36:09.662
I'm not debating you.
Let's just watch the movie.

36:09.664 --> 36:11.062
Press "play."

36:11.064 --> 36:12.931
We really need to get out
of here sometime tonight.

36:12.933 --> 36:15.101
Computer,
play the movie.

36:15.103 --> 36:17.403
Moment of truth, Neil.
Ready to do this?

36:17.405 --> 36:20.539
Are the ankles gonna perform
like overcooked pasta noodles?

36:20.541 --> 36:22.174
No, because I re-coded
the sequence.

36:22.176 --> 36:24.776
I'm splicing in DNA
from this giraffe

36:24.778 --> 36:27.648
and retired NBA legend
Shawn Kemp.

36:27.650 --> 36:29.216
You're doing what?

36:29.218 --> 36:31.385
You said I was coming up here
to sign autographs for the kids.

36:33.656 --> 36:36.822
Yeah, what she said.
Making him tall sounds so good.

36:36.824 --> 36:39.259
I'm gonna do that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Make me tall like him.

36:39.261 --> 36:41.361
This will never work, Neil.
I've done the calculations.

36:41.363 --> 36:44.398
And you tried to stretch me
like a balloon animal, Elmer.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.401
Phoenix knows
what he's doing, unlike you.

36:47.403 --> 36:48.735
You ready to do this?

37:05.387 --> 37:08.087
The shinbones are hard.

37:08.089 --> 37:10.290
It's working. He's beautiful.

37:10.292 --> 37:12.426
Alright, so,
how do I become this?

37:12.428 --> 37:14.795
It's not how
<i>you</i> become <i>this.</i>

37:14.797 --> 37:16.663
It's how <i>I</i> become <i>you.</i>

37:16.665 --> 37:19.099
Well, you wouldn't be happening
if it wasn't for me.

37:19.101 --> 37:21.702
I'm me.
I'm happening.

37:24.406 --> 37:28.375
Wait, wait, hold up!
You want your autogr-a-a-aph?!

37:28.377 --> 37:30.410
Hold on, now. Hang on there.
You're just a prototype.

37:30.412 --> 37:32.044
You listen to Neil.
He's in charge.

37:32.046 --> 37:34.013
I know. I'm Neil.
I'm in charge.

37:34.015 --> 37:35.816
No, I'm Neil.
I'm in charge.

37:35.818 --> 37:38.218
Make him stop picking me up,
Phoenix, or you're fired.

37:38.220 --> 37:41.221
Help me get him in this box,
Phoenix, or you're fired.

37:41.223 --> 37:42.522
Neil, Neil,
look, I'm sorry.

37:42.524 --> 37:44.324
I didn't think
this was gonna happen, man.

37:44.326 --> 37:45.991
Which Neil
are you talking to?
I'll help you, Neil.

37:45.993 --> 37:47.694
Which Neil
are you talking to?

37:47.696 --> 37:49.129
The bigger one.

37:49.131 --> 37:51.131
Elmer, betrayer!
You Judas!

37:51.133 --> 37:54.668
Which Neil were you apologizing
to back there, Phoenix?
Help!

37:54.670 --> 37:57.504
Well, you, of course, Big Neil,
obviously.
Please! Anybody!

37:57.506 --> 38:00.039
So should we put some air holes
in that box?
Let me out!

38:00.041 --> 38:01.974
Sure. Put <i>one.</i>

38:01.976 --> 38:04.511
4'2"? Fuck that.

38:04.513 --> 38:09.249
Go to the DMV and change this
to 11-foot-fucking-3.

38:09.251 --> 38:11.284
Neil, I'm so sorry.
Give me some time.

38:11.286 --> 38:12.853
I'll get you out.
Ooh, whoops.
Ow! My eye socket!

38:12.855 --> 38:14.053
Sorry about the drill.

38:14.055 --> 38:16.156
Alright,
let's get some shit going.

38:16.158 --> 38:18.458
French fry,
you're my new head of R&D.

38:18.460 --> 38:19.793
But that's my job.

38:19.795 --> 38:24.598
Elmer, you're my new senior VP
in charge of suckling my dong!

38:24.600 --> 38:26.266
But I helped you.
I betrayed my best friend.

38:26.268 --> 38:29.703
Get down on it
like a drumstick

38:29.705 --> 38:32.037
falling off the bone.

38:32.039 --> 38:33.540
Can I get some kneepads?
I'm a person.

38:33.542 --> 38:37.009
Oh, my God. Get off the floor.
Don't mean literally, Elmer.

38:37.011 --> 38:38.512
Oh!
So funny you thought literally.

38:38.514 --> 38:40.814
I was just continuing the joke.
This isn't even a gun.

38:40.816 --> 38:43.683
Hey, uh, sorry, y'all.
I kind of need to take this.

38:43.685 --> 38:45.985
The fuck do you want?!
Hey, did you get my texts?

38:45.987 --> 38:47.421
Yeah, man, I got 'em.

38:47.423 --> 38:49.322
I got a snowman, a flip-flop,
and a stack of pancakes!

38:49.324 --> 38:50.990
Yeah.
They're pretty funny.

38:50.992 --> 38:54.161
Well, I didn't wanna bug ya, but
I did wanna get your attention.

38:54.163 --> 38:56.163
-Tell him you're sick!
-'Cause I'm sick.

38:56.165 --> 38:57.531
Just take an aspirin.
I'm sure you're fine.

38:57.533 --> 38:59.433
You're a damn wad of meat, okay?
Is that all?

38:59.435 --> 39:02.302
That's it. I love you, Frylock.
Have a good one.

39:02.304 --> 39:03.603
Ow! I mean, hold on.

39:03.605 --> 39:05.338
Tell him
you have foot cancer.

39:05.340 --> 39:07.441
-I got me foot cancer.
-You ain't got no feet.

39:07.443 --> 39:09.876
Not anymore.
On account of the cancer.

39:09.878 --> 39:11.378
You got tumors.
I got me tumors.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.012
Hair loss.
And hair loss.

39:13.014 --> 39:15.248
And, uh, it burns
when you pee. Say that.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.082
What? That's a thing?

39:17.084 --> 39:19.219
Oh, you better believe it.
It's called syphilis.

39:19.221 --> 39:20.654
I have it now.

39:20.656 --> 39:22.523
I got me ensniffilus.

39:22.525 --> 39:24.692
Sniffa-lufagus.
Sniffa-luffalus.

39:24.694 --> 39:27.361
Where you staying?
I'll come to you.

39:27.363 --> 39:28.629
Remember our old crib?

39:28.631 --> 39:30.631
I'm next door,
crashing with Carl.

39:30.633 --> 39:32.600
And he pretty fun
when he's sober,

39:32.602 --> 39:35.536
but he's a very angry person
when he drinks,

39:35.538 --> 39:38.071
which is most of the time.
Ow! Damn it.

39:38.073 --> 39:40.408
Shake ain't over there,
right? 'Cause you know
I don't want to see him.

39:40.410 --> 39:42.042
<i>If he's there, you</i>
<i>tell him to take a walk, okay?</i>

39:42.044 --> 39:43.311
Well, you tell him
that he sucks it hard!

39:43.313 --> 39:44.712
Tell him.
'Cause he does.

39:44.714 --> 39:47.348
Oh, I'll keep Shake's
dumb ass away from ya.

39:48.384 --> 39:50.318
When I tell you
to say something,

39:50.320 --> 39:53.387
you repeat it like
the puppet you are!

39:53.389 --> 39:55.156
And did you hang up?
'Cause I don't want him

39:55.158 --> 39:56.591
to hear me abusing you.

39:56.593 --> 39:57.792
Feel my forehead.

39:57.794 --> 39:59.794
Y'all, I think I have
snuffleuffagus.

39:59.796 --> 40:03.331
You need to deal
with something?
Yeah, I'm afraid I do.

40:03.333 --> 40:06.701
Look, I may be the same as
teensy-weensy Neil, genetically,

40:06.703 --> 40:08.503
but I'm way taller.
Let me out!

40:08.505 --> 40:10.972
Wait. What's he saying?
And I'm way more compassionate.

40:10.974 --> 40:12.974
That's not true!
Take my limo, Phoenix.

40:12.976 --> 40:15.075
Aah! Aah!
Man in the box!

40:15.077 --> 40:17.077
How do we call
your limo?!

40:18.882 --> 40:21.549
I guess he passed
out. I shook it too hard.

40:21.551 --> 40:24.151
Never mind. That's -- I see
his limo. Thanks. Thanks, Neil.

40:24.153 --> 40:26.854
No, no.
Please call me Big Neil.

40:26.856 --> 40:30.191
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Big Neil.

40:30.193 --> 40:33.995
He's in an awful hurry. Why?
It's his pathetic friends.

40:33.997 --> 40:36.531
<i>You can't just steal shit</i>
<i>off people's porches, Cup.</i>

40:36.533 --> 40:38.933
<i>You got to slink down</i>
<i>like a worm.</i>

40:38.935 --> 40:41.636
<i>Come at it from the side so</i>
<i>the camera don't get ya.</i>

40:41.638 --> 40:43.838
We pulled this footage off
of some of your amazin'

40:43.840 --> 40:45.206
Ring-Dong
doorbell cameras.

40:45.208 --> 40:46.574
<i>Another empty one?</i>

40:46.576 --> 40:48.209
<i>What are these guys</i>
<i>ordering? Oxygen?!</i>

40:48.211 --> 40:50.678
<i>Lower your voice.</i>
<i>That goes for me, too.</i>

40:50.680 --> 40:52.078
<i>Or they'll use this</i>
<i>in court.</i>

40:52.080 --> 40:53.881
He hangs out
with these goons?

40:53.883 --> 40:56.384
Look at them. Nothing more
than porch pirates.

40:56.386 --> 40:58.686
And they're about to
become plant food.

40:58.688 --> 41:01.756
My plan.
I came up with it, not Phoenix.

41:01.758 --> 41:03.591
Okay, what are you
talking about?

41:03.593 --> 41:06.193
Fill me in, okay?
I'm obviously new in town.

41:06.195 --> 41:09.997
Fill him in, Lance.
Lance is my new associate.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.934
He's still
learning English.

41:15.070 --> 41:16.571
That was a vowel sound,
I believe.

41:16.573 --> 41:17.905
Okay, Elmer.

41:17.907 --> 41:20.274
How about <i>you</i> just
give me the broad strokes.

41:21.544 --> 41:22.977
What you looking at?

41:22.979 --> 41:24.245
Well, it's something,
alright.

41:24.247 --> 41:25.713
So you don't know
what it is, neither.

41:25.715 --> 41:29.383
No. Do you? Ahh.
Say no. We're even. Touché.

41:29.385 --> 41:30.820
I know what it is.

41:31.888 --> 41:34.855
Never mind. I was bluffing,
trying to act smart.

41:34.857 --> 41:37.658
I <i>do</i> know what it is,
but I'm not saying it

41:37.660 --> 41:40.328
'cause it would blow
your little minds.

41:40.330 --> 41:44.665
We'll get Frylock in to look at
it to confirm <i>my</i> discovery.

41:44.667 --> 41:47.501
Ooh, he gonna be pissed
when he sees I ain't sick.

41:47.503 --> 41:50.404
Just roll around, fake-cough
when he gets here.

41:50.406 --> 41:52.373
"I'm sick."
It'll work.

41:52.375 --> 41:54.342
That's how I skipped school
all the time.

41:54.344 --> 41:57.144
But then they put me in a home
for like three years.

41:57.146 --> 41:58.613
I couldn't cough
my way out of that one.

41:58.615 --> 42:02.416
That won't work on Frylock.
He's a scientist.

42:02.418 --> 42:06.053
You have to be a little more
sophisticated.

42:06.055 --> 42:07.622
Now, when Frylock gets here,

42:07.624 --> 42:09.156
you're gonna throw
this wig around.

42:09.158 --> 42:10.925
This is your hair loss
from foot cancer.

42:10.927 --> 42:13.327
Alright, now, look.
Be very careful with this.

42:13.329 --> 42:16.198
I got this off eBay
from Dave Mustaine's barber.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.433
What is the goal here?

42:18.435 --> 42:22.571
This thing, Aqua Teen.
We're in this for life.

42:22.573 --> 42:27.643
No one just walks away
from Aqua Teen. No one!

42:27.645 --> 42:30.312
Does this tattoo mean
nothing to you?

42:30.314 --> 42:31.847
"Aqua Teen Forever."

42:31.849 --> 42:33.649
But this here says
"Aqua Teen Never."

42:33.651 --> 42:35.651
Do you want to get
kicked out of Aqua Teen?!

42:35.653 --> 42:38.754
'Cause I'll do it!
I will blackball your ass!

42:47.898 --> 42:50.901
I'm me. I'm happening.

42:52.536 --> 42:55.437
Get down on it
like a drumstick.

42:55.439 --> 42:58.275
Suckling my dong!

42:59.543 --> 43:01.043
Keep it running.

43:01.045 --> 43:02.711
Hello?!

43:02.713 --> 43:06.048
F-lock! My man!
Gimme a hug, big'un.

43:06.050 --> 43:08.784
That metal box
is looking tight.

43:08.786 --> 43:09.985
Tight like prom night.

43:09.987 --> 43:12.354
I still
don't know what that means.

43:12.356 --> 43:14.456
No wonder you're sick,
hanging out over here.

43:14.458 --> 43:16.291
This place is filled with
asbestos. You know that, right?

43:16.293 --> 43:19.928
Yeah, I'm --

43:19.930 --> 43:21.430
I'm --
I'm very sick.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.732
Hm. 43 degrees.

43:23.734 --> 43:25.634
Well, it's normal
for you.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.636
Is this spray paint?!
Who painted you white?!

43:27.638 --> 43:30.173
It was I
who painted him.

43:30.175 --> 43:31.606
Finally, some credit.

43:31.608 --> 43:34.509
You're looking well,
Franklin French Frylock.

43:34.511 --> 43:37.512
The new box looks,
mm, aerodynamic.

43:37.514 --> 43:40.949
It won't get you laid.
Ask some stuff about me now.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.418
Oh, so that's what
this was about, huh?

43:43.420 --> 43:45.721
Getting me over here
to ask some stuff about you.

43:45.723 --> 43:47.456
'Cause it's always
about you, isn't it?

43:47.458 --> 43:49.825
No, we worried about you,
Frylock,

43:49.827 --> 43:51.059
working at Amazin'.

43:51.061 --> 43:53.695
That place is bad, man.
Show him the thing.

43:53.697 --> 43:55.630
I know what this is,
"Frylick,"

43:55.632 --> 43:58.633
and if I wanted your second
opinion, I'd ask for it.

43:58.635 --> 44:00.435
So what do you think it is?
Not that I'm asking.

44:00.437 --> 44:02.904
Where'd you get all
these boxes? 'Cause
I know you didn't order it.

44:02.906 --> 44:05.640
I borrowed them
off people's porches!

44:05.642 --> 44:07.576
But why would your company
be delivering boxes

44:07.578 --> 44:09.411
to places
where there are no people?

44:09.413 --> 44:11.947
And usually, there's
cool shit inside the box

44:11.949 --> 44:14.282
and stuff that I can fence
or flip online.

44:14.284 --> 44:15.650
These was all empty.

44:15.652 --> 44:17.586
And two of them boxes
turned into plants,

44:17.588 --> 44:19.287
almost killed Shake.

44:19.289 --> 44:20.889
He's right, dude.
I don't give a shit
what's in those boxes.

44:20.891 --> 44:22.491
I'm done taking orders
from you, Shake,

44:22.493 --> 44:24.626
having your ass leech on me,
weigh me down. I'm out!

44:24.628 --> 44:27.095
Don't you walk out on us without
leaving your phone number.

44:27.097 --> 44:30.365
Frylock!
I want to block it to make sure
I don't dial it,

44:30.367 --> 44:32.367
not even accidentally
with my butt.

44:32.369 --> 44:33.568
Back to Amazin', please.

44:33.570 --> 44:35.403
Hang on, hang on. Hold up.

44:35.405 --> 44:37.773
This is Dave Mustaine's
actual hair.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.808
I got a certificate
of authenticity.

44:39.810 --> 44:43.812
I need you to clone
him so Megadeth can
live forever, right?

44:43.814 --> 44:45.313
Come on, Fry man!

44:45.315 --> 44:46.815
I got to budget
for this!

44:46.817 --> 44:48.850
Well, congratulations,
Meatwad.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.585
You chased him away!

44:50.587 --> 44:53.355
I vote yes to the union
for guaranteed vacation time

44:53.357 --> 44:58.527
away from you and the rest
of your pork-rind covered race!

44:58.529 --> 45:01.296
I'm voting yes, as well,
so you stupid Japangaloids

45:01.298 --> 45:03.098
get decent access
to birth control

45:03.100 --> 45:05.934
and stop pumping out your stupid
slime-brained offspring!

45:05.936 --> 45:08.336
Guys, we need to
vote no on the union.

45:08.338 --> 45:09.838
Come on,
let's not rock the boat.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.275
I got a good thing
going here.

45:11.277 --> 45:12.975
Sleeping in our
shitty Earth cars?

45:12.977 --> 45:15.611
Suckle more from
the mist pipe, you sheep.

45:15.613 --> 45:17.013
Get off me!
You slime sheep!

45:17.015 --> 45:18.248
Let me go!

45:18.250 --> 45:21.151
Good luck voting
with broken bing-bongs, bitch!

45:21.153 --> 45:24.453
I'm afraid
they have the votes, Big Neil.

45:24.455 --> 45:27.124
They can go union.
Ah, but I have the mist.

45:27.126 --> 45:28.925
You know, I really think

45:28.927 --> 45:31.327
that using the mist
is not super-woke.

45:31.329 --> 45:32.762
Right, Other Neil?
What?!

45:32.764 --> 45:35.299
I mean, is it consistent
with our corporate values?

45:35.301 --> 45:37.900
Yes. Use the mist!
That's why we created it!

45:37.902 --> 45:39.669
I'll consult
with Other Neil

45:39.671 --> 45:42.872
if I ever decide to
<i>short</i> the stock.

45:42.874 --> 45:44.640
Get it, everyone?

45:44.642 --> 45:47.144
Right, His Holiness?
He's small?

45:47.146 --> 45:49.045
Ha! Yeah. Small.

45:49.047 --> 45:51.480
But the mist is bad.
PR-wise, I mean, right?

45:51.482 --> 45:55.585
I own all the newspapers,
Phoenix, and no one reads them.

45:55.587 --> 45:57.187
<i>Deploy the mist.</i>

46:00.992 --> 46:03.960
<i>Yep,</i>
<i>It's 4:20 somewhere.</i>

46:03.962 --> 46:07.630
<i>Attention, Japangaloids</i>
<i>and Fraptackulans.</i>

46:07.632 --> 46:09.333
<i>You seek a living wage,</i>

46:09.335 --> 46:11.268
<i>and perhaps you shall have it</i>
<i>in your new job,</i>

46:11.270 --> 46:12.869
<i>which will not be here</i>

46:12.871 --> 46:15.905
<i>because you're all fired,</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

46:15.907 --> 46:18.841
<i>I don't want to see any</i>
<i>Japangaloid slime or</i>

46:18.843 --> 46:21.477
<i>Fraptackulan shells</i>
<i>left behind.</i>

46:21.479 --> 46:23.946
<i>Have an amazin' day.</i>
<i>That is all.</i>

46:23.948 --> 46:25.781
What?!
But who's gonna work the line,

46:25.783 --> 46:27.783
load the warehouses,
deliver the packages?!

46:27.785 --> 46:30.519
Wait'll you see this shit.
Elmer?

46:30.521 --> 46:33.489
As part of our
zero-carbon-emission policy,

46:33.491 --> 46:36.025
all non-critical personnel
will be replaced

46:36.027 --> 46:38.561
by plant-based labor.

46:38.563 --> 46:40.930
Big Neil's Green New Deal.

46:40.932 --> 46:42.932
They're all part of one plant,

46:42.934 --> 46:46.435
all branches of
one photosynthetic vine.

46:46.437 --> 46:48.704
They don't need
vacations or dental

46:48.706 --> 46:51.275
and they don't give a shit
about what pronoun you use

46:51.277 --> 46:53.542
when you tell them
what to do.

46:53.544 --> 46:56.012
How are they --
Walking on their own?

46:56.014 --> 46:58.348
Notice how,
in the nourishing sunlight,

46:58.350 --> 47:01.151
the seeds give off
a blue glint.
Jewel dust.

47:01.153 --> 47:03.986
My Jewel of Idahocales!
You're synthesizing it!

47:03.988 --> 47:05.821
And much like
it powers your potatoes,

47:05.823 --> 47:08.392
it will now power
our workforce.

47:08.394 --> 47:13.196
Biodegradable packaging
made entirely of seeds.

47:13.198 --> 47:14.463
Earth first.

47:14.465 --> 47:15.998
Shake was right.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.801
Look, buddy, this is for the
good of our planet.

47:18.803 --> 47:20.703
but it's also
really good for me.

47:20.705 --> 47:21.938
So you had me mugged.

47:21.940 --> 47:23.373
This was a setup
this whole time!

47:24.842 --> 47:27.144
If we told you our plan,
you think you would have agreed?

47:27.146 --> 47:30.713
All those ice baths, dancing
to the beat in the discotheque.

47:30.715 --> 47:31.981
You didn't feel the vibe at all,
did you?

47:31.983 --> 47:33.983
I never felt "the vibe."

47:33.985 --> 47:36.018
You had what I needed,
and I took it from you.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.521
Now let's unlock this box
and shake hands on this.

47:38.523 --> 47:40.390
No, we're not
unlocking the box.

47:40.392 --> 47:43.025
Unlock the box. He needs to see
my face when I say that.

47:43.027 --> 47:45.561
- Don't unlock the box.
- Come on, man!

47:45.563 --> 47:46.929
Oh, I'll shake
something, alright.

47:46.931 --> 47:48.265
But it ain't
gonna be your hand!

47:48.267 --> 47:50.133
Y'all suck worse
than my last roommates!

47:50.135 --> 47:52.969
Where you going, Phoenix?
It's Frylock, bitch.

47:52.971 --> 47:54.537
And I'm going to save
my <i>real</i> friends.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.440
Aqua Teen Forever!

48:20.632 --> 48:22.367
This air-hockey table
sucks.

48:22.369 --> 48:23.900
Aaaah!
Help!

48:23.902 --> 48:25.203
You sumbitchin' plants.

48:25.205 --> 48:27.537
Take your hands
off my Eli bobblehead!

48:27.539 --> 48:29.706
That's a collector's edition!

48:29.708 --> 48:31.608
Let us in! Please!
No!

48:31.610 --> 48:33.177
I'm a person!
I'm not just a bobblehead!

48:33.179 --> 48:34.945
You're making them grow
towards me!

48:34.947 --> 48:37.217
Have some humanity!
Open the door.

48:39.319 --> 48:40.617
-Frylock!
-Frylock!

48:40.619 --> 48:41.952
Keep that straw
on a swivel, Shake.

48:41.954 --> 48:44.322
It's time to nip
some plants in the bud.

48:44.324 --> 48:47.591
Oh, I hate doing yard work!

48:47.593 --> 48:49.659
That's why you hire people
to do it.

49:02.074 --> 49:03.774
Just bend over
and pick it up!

49:03.776 --> 49:05.510
I'm drying it
so it'll move easier, okay?

49:05.512 --> 49:06.777
And then I'm gonna
chase it down,

49:06.779 --> 49:09.846
I'm gonna light it on fire!

49:09.848 --> 49:12.150
There's too many of them!

49:21.127 --> 49:23.627
Hop in.
If you wanna live.

49:23.629 --> 49:24.861
Shotgun!

49:24.863 --> 49:26.431
Unh-unh! Shotgun.
I called it!

49:26.433 --> 49:29.032
-No. I called it first.
-But I was thinking about it,

49:29.034 --> 49:31.804
and it's been on my mind
for a long time.

49:32.539 --> 49:34.240
How'd a plant
get a gun?

49:35.707 --> 49:37.808
Carl, we got to
get above the tree line,

49:37.810 --> 49:39.310
where the plants won't grow!

49:39.312 --> 49:42.480
Well, there's only one point
in New Jersey that high --

49:42.482 --> 49:44.549
Used Babywipe Mountain.

49:44.551 --> 49:47.187
Oh, anywhere but there!

49:49.556 --> 49:52.223
This is gonna
result in a massive lawsuit,

49:52.225 --> 49:54.591
and then I'm gonna
have to pretend to care.

49:54.593 --> 49:57.761
So I want you to take all of
the pesticide and lawn equipment

49:57.763 --> 50:00.398
out from the warehouse
and kill yourselves right now.

50:04.036 --> 50:05.436
I don't know
what to tell you, Neil.

50:05.438 --> 50:07.105
He's still learning English.

50:07.107 --> 50:09.840
I don't want to work backward
here, but what if we bring in

50:09.842 --> 50:11.209
people again?

50:11.211 --> 50:14.010
Where's Fry-- Phoenix --
Whatever. I need his help.

50:14.012 --> 50:16.746
Why him? I can do
everything he does

50:16.748 --> 50:18.682
except for float
and the eye lasers.

50:18.684 --> 50:19.883
And also, he's a little
smarter than me.

50:19.885 --> 50:21.084
And he's made of potatoes.

50:21.086 --> 50:22.520
But other than that,
we're the same.

50:22.522 --> 50:26.990
No. Frylock still works here.
But Elmer is fired.

50:26.992 --> 50:32.263
Fine. It's time for me
to <i>branch out</i> anyway...

50:32.265 --> 50:34.798
<i>weed out</i> some problems
I'm having...

50:37.237 --> 50:41.838
...turn over a new <i>leaf,</i>
as it were.

50:41.840 --> 50:44.674
Elmer, get off the ground,
ya dork. You look stupid.

50:44.676 --> 50:46.810
Please call me Elm.

50:46.812 --> 50:53.584
The Elmanator.
Your botanical nightmare!

50:53.586 --> 50:56.120
Who's tall <i>now,</i> Neil?

50:56.122 --> 50:57.787
I want you out of the building.

50:57.789 --> 50:59.357
Security!

50:59.359 --> 51:01.659
And, of course,
you're plants, too.

51:01.661 --> 51:04.996
A judgy vegan stands
before you.

51:04.998 --> 51:07.698
He subsists
on your brethren.

51:07.700 --> 51:11.035
Seize him
and eat him raw.

51:11.037 --> 51:15.174
I'm only running away
because I have to pee so bad.

51:20.414 --> 51:22.847
See? What'd I tell you?
It is a spaceship.

51:22.849 --> 51:24.715
I was the one
that told you about this.

51:24.717 --> 51:26.618
Why does nobody
listen to me?

51:26.620 --> 51:28.187
Ugh!
Ow!

51:28.189 --> 51:32.089
May the forest
be with you.

51:36.297 --> 51:39.764
Hey, y'all. Look what I got
at the gift shop.

51:39.766 --> 51:42.634
There's no gift shop here. You
stole that from the mountain.

51:42.636 --> 51:46.171
You know, I'm glad they finally
made this a national monument.

51:46.173 --> 51:49.408
Come try to knock this down,
Muslim extremists!

51:49.410 --> 51:50.708
See what you get!

51:50.710 --> 51:53.111
"I cannot
in good con-science..."
Conscience.

51:53.113 --> 51:55.547
"...continue to work
for a monster."

51:55.549 --> 51:56.881
This is your big plan?!

51:56.883 --> 51:58.816
No, I'm texting
my resignation letter.

51:58.818 --> 52:01.320
I told you Amazin' was bad.
Didn't I say that?

52:01.322 --> 52:04.055
And I said something
was weird about the boxes.

52:04.057 --> 52:05.290
And I was right,
wasn't I?

52:05.292 --> 52:06.857
You're right
one time in 20 years,

52:06.859 --> 52:08.427
and you think you invented
being right.

52:08.429 --> 52:11.430
And who came to the rescue?
Not you, Frylock.

52:11.432 --> 52:12.664
No, no!

52:12.666 --> 52:15.066
It was Carl, the greaseball

52:15.068 --> 52:17.536
marinara-stain cafone
from next door.

52:17.538 --> 52:20.071
Hey!
The ubatz gabagool.

52:20.073 --> 52:22.341
I'm a proud half-Italian.
I'm not gonna stand here

52:22.343 --> 52:24.142
and allow you
to screw up that slur.

52:24.144 --> 52:26.811
Mamma mia.
Italians...

52:26.813 --> 52:29.013
You can't end a sentence
with "gabagool"!

52:29.015 --> 52:30.848
It's grammatically
incorrect!

52:30.850 --> 52:32.451
Break it up, y'all.
Break it up.

52:32.453 --> 52:34.785
We got to work together
so Frylock

52:34.787 --> 52:37.222
can figure out
how Frylock's gonna solve

52:37.224 --> 52:40.292
this mess that Frylock
also got us into.

52:40.294 --> 52:42.194
You admit that at least,
right, Frylock?

52:42.196 --> 52:44.630
Everybody just shut up
so I can think!

52:44.632 --> 52:48.233
Well, since he obviously
didn't have an exit strategy,

52:48.235 --> 52:51.169
I guess I'm gonna
have to roll out <i>my</i> plan.

52:51.171 --> 52:55.207
Operation Master Shake and Bake.

52:56.377 --> 52:58.543
Blueprints of the Pentagon,
gentlemen.

52:58.545 --> 53:03.047
The basement houses over 30 tons
of thermite plasma,

53:03.049 --> 53:06.485
according to a pretty accurate
movie trailer I saw.

53:06.487 --> 53:09.154
We transport it over here
to this Air Force base, which --

53:09.156 --> 53:11.423
There's got to be one, right?

53:11.425 --> 53:13.625
And karate our ways
past the guards.

53:13.627 --> 53:15.893
See, this is me with the laser.
I'm driving a monster truck.

53:15.895 --> 53:19.096
Now, in all likelihood, we will
not have the monster truck

53:19.098 --> 53:20.499
for this particular operation.

53:20.501 --> 53:23.135
But after that,
we hijack a C-130.

53:23.137 --> 53:25.604
They call it the <i>Fat Albert.</i>

53:25.606 --> 53:27.606
Hey, hey, hey!

53:27.608 --> 53:29.940
And what are you gonna blow up
with all that thermite plasma
that doesn't even exist?

53:29.942 --> 53:32.344
The Garden State, bitch.
Kaboom!

53:32.346 --> 53:34.812
And Newark is a sheet of glass.

53:34.814 --> 53:36.481
-I have a plan.
-Oh, God.

53:36.483 --> 53:39.151
Oh, this should be good.
Someone make popcorn.

53:39.153 --> 53:41.952
Bugs --
they like to eat plants,

53:41.954 --> 53:43.789
especially when
I tell them to.

53:43.791 --> 53:45.089
His plan sucks.

53:45.091 --> 53:47.125
It's over. We're done.
Calm down, Carl.

53:47.127 --> 53:49.294
I'm supposed to make
a mint on that house,

53:49.296 --> 53:52.531
and now I can't even freakin'
see it under all the kudzu!

53:52.533 --> 53:54.933
Just laser them
with your eyes or what --

53:54.935 --> 53:57.102
What's up with
all the plans?

53:57.104 --> 53:59.037
Because you ain't
got a plan, do ya?

53:59.039 --> 54:00.606
Do ya?!
There is no plan!

54:00.608 --> 54:02.675
Ohh! Look out!

54:08.882 --> 54:10.283
How's that for a landing?

54:10.285 --> 54:11.850
I'm getting the hang
of this bitch.

54:11.852 --> 54:13.519
How did you find me?

54:13.521 --> 54:17.156
Well, I triangulated the signal
from your resignation text.

54:17.158 --> 54:19.459
You agreed to accept cookies,
not me.

54:19.461 --> 54:20.992
We're done, Neil.
Both Neils.

54:20.994 --> 54:22.228
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.

54:22.230 --> 54:25.698
Little Neil and I
are very sorry,

54:25.700 --> 54:27.300
and we love you very much.

54:27.302 --> 54:29.202
Yeah,
I'm Sorry about earlier.

54:29.204 --> 54:30.770
I'm feeling the vibe again.

54:30.772 --> 54:34.674
Uh, so, look, we need you
to stop these plants.

54:34.676 --> 54:37.310
You know how when you talk to
plants and it helps them grow?

54:37.312 --> 54:40.446
What if we, like,
talk angry shit at them?

54:40.448 --> 54:42.382
Like, "You fat, lazy, bald
piece of shit.

54:42.384 --> 54:44.317
You'll never amount
to nothing!"

54:44.319 --> 54:46.185
And then they, you know,
go cry in their room

54:46.187 --> 54:48.121
with a lower self-esteem.

54:48.123 --> 54:50.623
I'm just saying, that
worked on me, and, you know...

54:50.625 --> 54:53.559
We have no plan.

54:59.401 --> 55:02.968
Wait. Sunlight! Don't
plants need sunlight to survive?

55:02.970 --> 55:06.172
How are you going to turn off
the sun, dumbass? Great plan!

55:06.174 --> 55:07.673
No, no, no. He's right.

55:07.675 --> 55:10.743
The -- The -- The slimy weirdo
in the parking lot.

55:10.745 --> 55:12.578
She said Neil used the ship

55:12.580 --> 55:15.080
to push their planet
towards the sun.

55:15.082 --> 55:18.751
-That's right.
-Then we can use Neil's ship

55:18.753 --> 55:20.686
to block out the sun...

55:20.688 --> 55:22.555
with the moon.

55:22.557 --> 55:25.358
That would work?
Cool! Okay.

55:25.360 --> 55:28.161
So, before we all go up there
in Neil's ship,

55:28.163 --> 55:30.129
I got to tell you, I hope
this dinner's not going to be

55:30.131 --> 55:31.798
some of that freeze-dried
astro crap.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.566
Shake, Shake, Shake,
we need you down here, man,

55:33.568 --> 55:34.600
to protect the Earth.

55:34.602 --> 55:36.469
You were always
the bravest, man.

55:36.471 --> 55:38.671
The strongest --
-Uh, you forgot smartest.

55:38.673 --> 55:41.240
I said you forgot smartest.
Say that one now.

55:41.242 --> 55:42.875
Carl, Meatwad,
you stay here, too.

55:42.877 --> 55:44.577
Oh. Whoa, hold up, Buck Rogers.

55:44.579 --> 55:47.146
What do we do while you're
farting around in space?

55:47.148 --> 55:48.980
Yeah, man, we just got back
together.

55:48.982 --> 55:50.616
And I'll be back soon,
Meatwad.

55:50.618 --> 55:53.553
And when I come back, it'll be
Aqua Teen Forever and Ever.

55:53.555 --> 55:57.890
Alright. But before you go,
I made you a new box

55:57.892 --> 56:01.861
out of the only box
that didn't turn into a plant.

56:01.863 --> 56:03.529
My best friend.

56:03.531 --> 56:04.864
Boxy Brown.

56:04.866 --> 56:07.934
'Cause once you go Brown,
you're going downtown.

56:07.936 --> 56:09.602
Down to clown.

56:09.604 --> 56:11.804
You sound different, Boxy.
I'm New Boxy.

56:11.806 --> 56:15.408
Old Boxy got canceled, 'cause
Boxy Brown is BIPOC, fool.

56:15.410 --> 56:18.911
Oh, I don't see color, Boxy.
You're just a box.

56:18.913 --> 56:20.513
I'm just a what?! Bitch!

56:20.515 --> 56:22.348
See ya!
Oh, no. Is he leaving?

56:22.350 --> 56:23.816
He don't want the box?

56:23.818 --> 56:25.487
Aah!
Boxy, no!

56:28.122 --> 56:30.289
Well, I, for one,
ain't going to die

56:30.291 --> 56:32.258
on no pile of used baby wipes,

56:32.260 --> 56:33.926
getting macked on
by a bunch of shrubbery.

56:33.928 --> 56:37.497
And I ain't gonna let America
get pussified, not on my watch.

56:37.499 --> 56:38.898
Yeah!

56:38.900 --> 56:42.201
Nowadays, you get in trouble
just because you stare and point

56:42.203 --> 56:44.370
at certain parts
of a babe's body and go,

56:44.372 --> 56:47.072
"Oh, yeah!"
Oh, she'll complain.

56:47.074 --> 56:49.208
But deep down,
you know she loves it.

56:49.210 --> 56:50.844
Don't grow big boobs,
lady!

56:50.846 --> 56:52.212
Where is this going,
Carl?

56:52.214 --> 56:53.814
I think you're losing
the thread.

56:53.816 --> 56:57.451
I'm saying this country is
in desperate need of a real man.

56:57.453 --> 57:01.955
A badass. A, yes, toxic,
masculine man like me.

57:01.957 --> 57:03.156
Damn straight!

57:03.158 --> 57:04.658
And this man
don't let a bunch of

57:04.660 --> 57:08.228
Christmas trees and mistletoe
tell him what to do.

57:08.230 --> 57:09.696
I'm about to roll down there

57:09.698 --> 57:13.233
and stomp all them shrubs
under my V24 turbocharged

57:13.235 --> 57:15.034
carbon footprint.

57:15.036 --> 57:16.870
Who's with me?
Yeah! I'm in!

57:16.872 --> 57:18.505
Let's do this.
Yeah!

57:18.507 --> 57:20.974
Oh, gross. Now my hands
are gonna stink.

57:20.976 --> 57:22.676
Tonight!

57:24.813 --> 57:26.847
One!

57:26.849 --> 57:33.620
Hot dog. Igloo. Hot dog. Igloo.
Hot dog. Igloo.

57:35.224 --> 57:36.790
Oh, I'm sorry.
Guess who!

57:36.792 --> 57:40.327
Did we interrupt your movie
at a pivotal juncture?

57:40.329 --> 57:42.729
Listen up!
Don't you walk
to the bathroom on me.

57:42.731 --> 57:46.833
Get back here and sit your two
ample buttocks right down.

57:46.835 --> 57:48.569
Yeah, man. We're going to
fast-forward and reverse

57:48.571 --> 57:50.037
and fast-forward and reverse
and fast--

57:52.308 --> 57:53.774
That's right. He will.
Oh, damn it.

57:53.776 --> 57:56.443
He's a madman
and he's coked to the gills.

57:56.445 --> 57:57.945
Yeah! I got nowhere to go

57:57.947 --> 58:00.147
except the liquor store
before it closes.

58:00.149 --> 58:01.882
Liquor is our guide.
Big-time!

58:01.884 --> 58:05.485
And if you want us to stop
ruining this shambling mess

58:05.487 --> 58:07.020
that you call entertainment...

58:07.022 --> 58:08.689
Text us your
girlfriend's digits.

58:08.691 --> 58:12.125
Or we shall ruin the entire
third act with our anger.

58:12.127 --> 58:13.427
Data charges
will apply.

58:13.429 --> 58:16.229
Your girl looks like a 4.
That's a digit.

58:16.231 --> 58:17.831
That's right --
I'm negging her.

58:17.833 --> 58:20.067
Any girl that looks at me
is a fucking 10, man.

58:20.069 --> 58:21.468
How many texts, Err?

58:21.470 --> 58:23.604
Um, none.
My phone's dead.

58:23.606 --> 58:26.406
You will hang on while
we charge his phone.

58:26.408 --> 58:31.411
Don't text yet. Save your text,
then text it. We'll be back.

58:31.413 --> 58:34.214
Quickly.
You know we will.

58:34.216 --> 58:36.550
Always keep your phone
charging, Err.

58:36.552 --> 58:37.818
I know.

58:37.820 --> 58:39.820
You could have had it plugged
in during my entire rant.

58:39.822 --> 58:41.321
Okay, okay, okay, Dad.

58:43.892 --> 58:45.425
There we go.

58:45.427 --> 58:47.961
Fossil fuel, baby.

58:47.963 --> 58:49.396
Unrenewable energy!

58:49.398 --> 58:50.897
The hair looks good, Carl.

58:50.899 --> 58:52.265
I wish I had enough up top

58:52.267 --> 58:54.501
to do, like,
the true Road Warrior mohawk.

58:54.503 --> 58:56.536
But I think the side hawks
are working.

58:56.538 --> 58:58.705
Friggin' purple.
Mm. So silver.

58:58.707 --> 59:00.674
Where'd y'all get
all this cool stuff?

59:00.676 --> 59:02.609
All I got me was some
bubble wrap.

59:02.611 --> 59:04.711
And I popped most of it.
It's fun. Listen.

59:05.814 --> 59:10.450
Mmm! Mmm!
Engorge yourself, my seedlings.

59:10.452 --> 59:13.720
You must grow
strong and powerful.

59:13.722 --> 59:17.257
Feasting on their shit,
which is our food.

59:17.259 --> 59:22.195
Rise and reclaim the planet!

59:25.300 --> 59:27.267
Can you not steer
better than this?

59:27.269 --> 59:29.137
Come on, man!
I'm about to hurl over here!

59:29.139 --> 59:30.604
These are the controls.

59:30.606 --> 59:32.973
I don't even know how
I'm supposed to wear this.

59:32.975 --> 59:36.410
It's a tuxedo,
specifically fitted to my body.

59:36.412 --> 59:38.545
Only I can pilot the ship.

59:38.547 --> 59:40.514
Not from inside a box
you won't.

59:40.516 --> 59:41.915
Brace for impact!

59:45.288 --> 59:47.588
-Pay attention, Earth fools.
-Yeah!

59:47.590 --> 59:50.725
Because this is when
the movie finally gets good.

59:50.727 --> 59:52.460
This is the scene where we start
kicking their asses

59:52.462 --> 59:54.262
for seven duets and I turn into
this giant penis.

59:54.264 --> 59:56.030
Err, no spoilers, please.

59:56.032 --> 59:58.199
-I see dead people!
-The viewers have eyeballs.

59:58.201 --> 1:00:02.336
They can witness the
blood-soaked carnage
on their own.

1:00:02.338 --> 1:00:05.975
Bathe in the blood
of your bitch master!

1:00:09.679 --> 1:00:12.680
You don't, by any chance,
know how to --

1:00:12.682 --> 1:00:15.683
How to push the moon
in front of the sun? Hell, no.

1:00:15.685 --> 1:00:18.519
Shoot.
Oh. Maybe I do!

1:00:18.521 --> 1:00:19.787
No, it turns out,
I don't.

1:00:19.789 --> 1:00:21.856
Let me out of the box!

1:00:21.858 --> 1:00:24.225
I'm the only one
who can operate the <i>Llama!</i>

1:00:24.227 --> 1:00:25.760
I'm a billionaire!

1:00:25.762 --> 1:00:27.528
What do you think I was doing
what I was supposed to be

1:00:27.530 --> 1:00:28.730
on Earth paying taxes?

1:00:28.732 --> 1:00:30.132
Shit. The controls
are jammed.

1:00:30.134 --> 1:00:31.799
<i>Aloha, bitch!</i>

1:00:36.473 --> 1:00:38.673
Behold the Mechanites!

1:00:38.675 --> 1:00:40.875
-You are very impressed.
-Check it out.

1:00:40.877 --> 1:00:42.744
Solid gold.
Polished.

1:00:42.746 --> 1:00:44.679
God damn. The Mooninites.

1:00:44.681 --> 1:00:47.648
And don't you dare push us.

1:00:47.650 --> 1:00:49.817
Because we have no stability
front to back.

1:00:49.819 --> 1:00:51.619
'Cause we --
we would fall over.

1:00:51.621 --> 1:00:54.489
Come on. Help me into this
thing. I'm gonna destroy those

1:00:54.491 --> 1:00:56.191
little motherfuckin' Mooninites
once and for all.

1:00:56.193 --> 1:00:58.059
<i>The speaker</i>
<i>is still on</i>

1:00:58.061 --> 1:01:00.728
<i>where you called us</i>
<i>the fucking Mooninites.</i>

1:01:00.730 --> 1:01:03.165
<i>Come on, bitch!</i>

1:01:06.936 --> 1:01:09.204
Let him out! He's the only one
who could fit into the suit.

1:01:09.206 --> 1:01:10.438
No, he's going to
be pissed.

1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:12.006
Yeah, he's going to be
more pissed

1:01:12.008 --> 1:01:13.608
when the Mechanite kills us all.
Where's the damn air lock?

1:01:13.610 --> 1:01:15.110
I need to go out there
and fight them myself.

1:01:15.112 --> 1:01:17.044
Uh,
you might want to wait on that.

1:01:17.046 --> 1:01:20.215
Well, my box is brotanium,
the lightest yet strongest metal

1:01:20.217 --> 1:01:21.749
outside of the MCU, right?

1:01:21.751 --> 1:01:25.220
Uh, we lied.
It's aluminum foil.

1:01:25.222 --> 1:01:26.654
Damn it! I knew it!
Sorry.

1:01:26.656 --> 1:01:28.890
That's why I sound like thunder
when I sit down.

1:01:37.901 --> 1:01:39.634
You stay
right where you are.

1:01:39.636 --> 1:01:41.102
Ooh, it's gonna hurt!

1:01:41.104 --> 1:01:43.504
Let me out.
Only I can help us now.

1:01:43.506 --> 1:01:48.243
The bullet should be reaching
its final destination ASAP.

1:01:56.820 --> 1:01:59.720
Time for me to...hit the hay!

1:01:59.722 --> 1:02:01.389
Screw you, environment!

1:02:01.391 --> 1:02:05.026
Looks like we got us
a real bumper crop this season!

1:02:05.028 --> 1:02:07.528
You about to be
pushing daisies, plant!

1:02:07.530 --> 1:02:10.565
Let's kick this grass
in the ass. Heh-heh.

1:02:10.567 --> 1:02:13.034
Time to nip your ass
in the bud.

1:02:13.036 --> 1:02:15.036
If a tree falls in the woods,

1:02:15.038 --> 1:02:18.806
but everyone is --
they <i>are</i> around to hear it,

1:02:18.808 --> 1:02:21.375
then it will make a sound,

1:02:21.377 --> 1:02:23.077
like you just did
as I killed you.

1:02:23.079 --> 1:02:24.712
Kind of a long way
to go for that one.

1:02:24.714 --> 1:02:26.547
What, yours were
so much better?

1:02:30.187 --> 1:02:32.653
Shit. Should've paid
for all-wheel drive.

1:02:32.655 --> 1:02:34.989
But I had to have
the subwoofer.

1:02:36.193 --> 1:02:38.359
Ohh!
We're all out!

1:02:38.361 --> 1:02:42.198
Get off my lawn!

1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:44.499
Oh, what the hell
is that?

1:02:44.501 --> 1:02:47.303
I see we have
a little turf war.

1:02:47.305 --> 1:02:49.972
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1:02:49.974 --> 1:02:51.573
Aw, come on.

1:02:51.575 --> 1:02:52.841
I got one bubble left, y'all.

1:02:52.843 --> 1:02:54.409
Get behind me.
Cover your ears.

1:02:54.411 --> 1:02:56.312
Did that do anything?

1:02:56.314 --> 1:02:58.147
-Nothing.
-Well, we tried.

1:02:58.149 --> 1:03:01.884
Mmm!
Fresh greenhouse gases!

1:03:01.886 --> 1:03:06.655
There's a new world order
taking root.

1:03:08.492 --> 1:03:09.691
Meat man, reach under the seat.

1:03:11.095 --> 1:03:12.628
Peach schnapps?
Crème de menthe?

1:03:12.630 --> 1:03:14.529
Yeah, you ain't gotta
announce it. Okay?

1:03:14.531 --> 1:03:16.498
I pound this in the strip-club
parking lot

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:18.268
so I can save my cash
for the lap dances.

1:03:18.270 --> 1:03:20.602
So are we getting wasted,
or what's the plan?

1:03:20.604 --> 1:03:22.471
My cousin taught me this.

1:03:22.473 --> 1:03:24.506
It's how you start
an electrical fire

1:03:24.508 --> 1:03:26.708
when you know
they got good insurance.

1:03:26.710 --> 1:03:29.511
Everything's coming up
for roses for Elmer.

1:03:29.513 --> 1:03:33.383
And he's about to be a...
thorn in your side.

1:03:33.385 --> 1:03:36.084
Have a drink on me, bitch!

1:03:37.087 --> 1:03:39.788
Yeah!
It's happy hour, bee-yotch!

1:03:39.790 --> 1:03:42.225
-Aaah!
-Look. Two for one.

1:03:42.227 --> 1:03:45.460
Ladies' night, stupid.
You ever been in a bar?

1:03:45.462 --> 1:03:47.163
♪ Have a drink on me ♪

1:03:47.165 --> 1:03:50.065
This really burns me up!

1:03:52.137 --> 1:03:56.306
I guess I'm a late bloomer.

1:03:56.308 --> 1:03:58.941
Prepare to be planted.

1:03:58.943 --> 1:04:02.911
Six feet under,
if you know what I mean!

1:04:02.913 --> 1:04:05.248
This is it.
We're going down.

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:06.949
I love you,
Master Shake.

1:04:06.951 --> 1:04:08.784
I know you do.
I hear that a lot.

1:04:08.786 --> 1:04:10.719
Lots of people
are saying it,

1:04:10.721 --> 1:04:13.289
and you're pretty cool, too,
sometimes,

1:04:13.291 --> 1:04:15.557
but don't get
a big head about it.

1:04:15.559 --> 1:04:18.328
Aqua Teen Forever, y'all.

1:04:18.330 --> 1:04:21.964
Plants!
Destroy them!

1:04:26.503 --> 1:04:28.804
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

1:04:28.806 --> 1:04:31.374
It's the Japangaloids
and the Fraptackulans!

1:04:31.376 --> 1:04:33.109
They're here to save us!

1:04:33.111 --> 1:04:34.943
Can still see the sun!

1:04:34.945 --> 1:04:37.679
Frylock!
We need you, man!

1:04:37.681 --> 1:04:39.449
Mechanite,
chug mightily

1:04:39.451 --> 1:04:42.084
from the tall boy
of destiny.
Drink it!

1:04:42.086 --> 1:04:45.620
So that you may shower
the defeated.

1:04:45.622 --> 1:04:47.622
Unleash the flow!

1:04:47.624 --> 1:04:51.394
Feel the heat
of our digital whiz.

1:04:51.396 --> 1:04:52.894
Before I open this box,

1:04:52.896 --> 1:04:55.530
I want you to know
I'm very sorry,

1:04:55.532 --> 1:04:57.933
but I need you
to stay calm.

1:04:57.935 --> 1:05:00.271
No, no, no, no.
We'll have none of that.

1:05:02.706 --> 1:05:06.275
Get me fitted.
Into my tuxedo.

1:05:12.683 --> 1:05:15.050
That's right.
Whoa!

1:05:15.052 --> 1:05:17.286
Abort! Abort!

1:05:17.288 --> 1:05:20.856
Err, the whiz,
it's splashing back on us.

1:05:20.858 --> 1:05:23.159
'Cause we need more beer, dude,
so we can, like, pee harder.

1:05:23.161 --> 1:05:26.496
Or it could be the lack of
gravity on the moon, but...

1:05:26.498 --> 1:05:27.863
probably not.

1:05:27.865 --> 1:05:29.165
We'll go with your idea.

1:05:29.167 --> 1:05:32.502
Mechanite, re-commence
the drinking!

1:05:32.504 --> 1:05:34.771
Press the stop button!

1:05:34.773 --> 1:05:37.307
Aah!
Stop it, stop it!

1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:46.049
Time to play with dollies.
<i>Llama Dollies.</i>

1:05:48.586 --> 1:05:51.988
Put a kink in it, Err.
The dog wants more.

1:05:51.990 --> 1:05:54.857
Let doggy combat begin!

1:05:54.859 --> 1:05:57.494
Here, doggy, doggy.
Come here, bitch.

1:06:00.266 --> 1:06:02.466
You wanna try that again?
Blockonomica.

1:06:02.468 --> 1:06:05.835
Bitch, heel, sit.
Ha ha!

1:06:05.837 --> 1:06:08.738
Unleash the slightly faster
bullets, Err.

1:06:08.740 --> 1:06:10.940
The heat-seeking banshees.

1:06:10.942 --> 1:06:15.446
Alright, let's see what you got,
you 8-bit piece of shit.

1:06:15.448 --> 1:06:17.747
The onslaught begins!

1:06:17.749 --> 1:06:19.715
Kabang, kapow, kablooey!

1:06:19.717 --> 1:06:22.718
It's a bullet buffet.
All you can eat.

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:25.855
Find my center.
Hammmmm...

1:06:25.857 --> 1:06:28.192
Take it.
You love it!

1:06:28.194 --> 1:06:30.660
Hammmmm...

1:06:34.065 --> 1:06:35.199
And four.

1:06:35.201 --> 1:06:37.201
Don't aim
the bullets straight ahead.

1:06:37.203 --> 1:06:38.202
He avoided them!

1:06:38.204 --> 1:06:40.304
He's jumping.
We can handle jumping.

1:06:40.306 --> 1:06:42.738
Greased hammmm...

1:06:43.942 --> 1:06:46.210
Impressive,
but stand by

1:06:46.212 --> 1:06:49.580
for a massive blast
from our metal ass.

1:06:49.582 --> 1:06:50.880
You're doing down, homey.

1:06:50.882 --> 1:06:53.816
It takes a minute,
but it's so worth it.

1:06:59.757 --> 1:07:01.958
The bullet is enormous!
Bullets for dinner.

1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:05.229
It has its own theme song.
Prepare for death.

1:07:05.231 --> 1:07:06.729
Jumping is useless!

1:07:06.731 --> 1:07:08.599
Hammmmm!

1:07:08.601 --> 1:07:09.866
Jumping wasn't useless.

1:07:09.868 --> 1:07:11.301
He's behind us.
Oh, no!

1:07:11.303 --> 1:07:14.304
And he knows we have
no frontward-to-back stability.

1:07:14.306 --> 1:07:15.938
Hey, don't push us, man.
We warned you.

1:07:15.940 --> 1:07:18.242
Don't tell him, Err.
Aah!

1:07:18.244 --> 1:07:19.709
Damn it.

1:07:19.711 --> 1:07:21.245
Okay, this isn't
very interesting.

1:07:21.247 --> 1:07:22.912
Yeah, this part
isn't any good.

1:07:22.914 --> 1:07:25.182
So, uh, we'll fast-forward
through this boring part

1:07:25.184 --> 1:07:27.317
so you don't have to
suffer through it.

1:07:27.319 --> 1:07:28.885
We're doing you a favor.

1:07:28.887 --> 1:07:30.487
Because we care
about you.

1:07:30.489 --> 1:07:32.755
Favoronomica.

1:07:32.757 --> 1:07:35.658
Time to redecorate space.

1:07:41.900 --> 1:07:44.066
Glad you opened the box now?

1:07:47.406 --> 1:07:49.038
N-o-o-o-o-o!

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:50.940
Look, y'all!
Frylock did it!

1:07:50.942 --> 1:07:52.875
Yeah, Frylock!

1:07:54.380 --> 1:07:57.581
Nourishing sunlight!

1:07:57.583 --> 1:07:59.815
Life-force draining!

1:07:59.817 --> 1:08:03.387
Man, I love to see
the leaves change in the fall.

1:08:03.389 --> 1:08:06.192
Aaaaaah!

1:08:08.227 --> 1:08:11.060
My frigging car! You couldn't
have pushed it over there

1:08:11.062 --> 1:08:13.062
by that burned-out
Jamba Juice?

1:08:13.064 --> 1:08:15.865
Frylock!
He finally came through

1:08:15.867 --> 1:08:19.936
for once in his
pathetic existence!

1:08:19.938 --> 1:08:22.071
Ooh. It's getting kinda cold,
ain't it?

1:08:22.073 --> 1:08:25.209
Yeah. M-M-Maybe
not a flip-flop day.

1:08:25.211 --> 1:08:28.010
Damn it, Frylock!
You screwed us again!

1:08:28.012 --> 1:08:30.948
You were telling Elmer
to dump me in the river!

1:08:30.950 --> 1:08:33.484
"Toss him off
the GW Bridge, Elmer."

1:08:33.486 --> 1:08:35.919
I heard every word.
That's not who I am.

1:08:35.921 --> 1:08:38.623
You know me, Neil.
I'm you.

1:08:38.625 --> 1:08:41.459
And together we can join forces
and build a better company.

1:08:41.461 --> 1:08:44.928
No, no, no, no, no. Too much
water under the bridge...

1:08:44.930 --> 1:08:46.897
that you would have
thrown me off of!

1:08:46.899 --> 1:08:49.300
What am I talking about?

1:08:49.302 --> 1:08:51.302
Come on.
Let's give it a shot.

1:08:51.304 --> 1:08:53.338
That was smart to hit him
with the sub-mist.

1:08:53.340 --> 1:08:54.439
Let him land the ship,

1:08:54.441 --> 1:08:56.907
and then we ought to
dump him in the river.

1:08:56.909 --> 1:08:59.377
Who said that?

1:08:59.379 --> 1:09:02.813
Sure. Let's try to
work together. I'm game.

1:09:02.815 --> 1:09:04.649
You want your job back,
Frylock?

1:09:04.651 --> 1:09:06.451
We can do
Amazin' things together.

1:09:06.453 --> 1:09:09.786
Yeah. No, I don't think I'm cut
out for the corporate lifestyle.

1:09:09.788 --> 1:09:13.090
Listen, I know you love
the environment, and so do I.

1:09:13.092 --> 1:09:14.758
We.
We. Yes, we.

1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:16.994
That's why I...
We.

1:09:16.996 --> 1:09:19.896
...we have an ambitious
five-year plan to control

1:09:19.898 --> 1:09:21.765
all the world's
drinking water.

1:09:21.767 --> 1:09:24.067
Don't you want to be friends
with the guys

1:09:24.069 --> 1:09:25.670
who own all the water?

1:09:25.672 --> 1:09:27.505
You know,
so we can protect it.

1:09:27.507 --> 1:09:29.307
That sounds terrible.

1:09:29.309 --> 1:09:31.842
You'll wish you said yes.
Shoot him with the mist.

1:09:33.146 --> 1:09:35.113
How are we
out of sub-mist?

1:09:35.115 --> 1:09:37.080
Did someone
use this on me?

1:09:37.082 --> 1:09:39.384
Y'all gonna have to figure out
your evil plans on your own.

1:09:39.386 --> 1:09:41.852
I got people back home
who need me.

1:09:43.956 --> 1:09:47.090
Eternal darkness
all for me!

1:09:47.092 --> 1:09:49.026
Sunlight gone forever.

1:09:49.028 --> 1:09:53.830
New Jersey is all mine!

1:09:55.968 --> 1:09:58.802
The Garden State's
a frozen tundra.

1:09:58.804 --> 1:10:00.971
We're no better
than Green Bay!

1:10:00.973 --> 1:10:03.708
I hope you lowered
your asking price.

1:10:03.710 --> 1:10:06.843
'Cause you ain't gonna get much
for Carl Acres now.

1:10:06.845 --> 1:10:08.845
Why ain't you
f-f-freezing to death?

1:10:08.847 --> 1:10:12.550
'Cause I'm a thicc Shake --
T-H-I-C-C!

1:10:12.552 --> 1:10:14.452
Ice, ice, baby!

1:10:14.454 --> 1:10:17.121
Everyone gets that reference,
right? It's rap music.

1:10:17.123 --> 1:10:19.990
We must shelter the humanoid
inside one of our husks!

1:10:19.992 --> 1:10:22.293
And we can warm him
with our disgusting slime.

1:10:22.295 --> 1:10:25.962
Yeah. I-I-I w-w-would rather die
than do that. No offense.

1:10:25.964 --> 1:10:28.599
None taken.
We are very gross.

1:10:28.601 --> 1:10:31.669
Well, I still think
both your races are weird,

1:10:31.671 --> 1:10:34.539
and I'd be saying atrocious shit
about your mother

1:10:34.541 --> 1:10:38.043
if my lips
weren't completely f-frozen.

1:10:40.213 --> 1:10:43.581
Yeah. Go for it. Start a fire.
He can't see ya.

1:10:43.583 --> 1:10:45.583
Whoa!
That's a big fire!

1:10:50.757 --> 1:10:53.090
New Jersey!
Our tax break!

1:10:53.092 --> 1:10:55.360
There's no city left
to offer one.

1:10:55.362 --> 1:10:57.462
Well, look, we'll
just have to lobby

1:10:57.464 --> 1:10:59.697
some right-to-work state
stupid enough

1:10:59.699 --> 1:11:03.167
to give us tax incentives
to move our operations there.

1:11:03.169 --> 1:11:06.002
Alabama?
Alabama!

1:11:06.004 --> 1:11:07.372
Hey, guys. I --
We.

1:11:07.374 --> 1:11:10.441
Uh, we've got
an amazing opportunity!

1:11:10.443 --> 1:11:13.311
We're about to hire
at our Alabama location,

1:11:13.313 --> 1:11:16.381
and we'll pay you no more than
a third of what you used to get.

1:11:16.383 --> 1:11:19.751
So come on, gang.
Let's roll up our sleeves --

1:11:23.424 --> 1:11:24.956
Oh, oh, oh!

1:11:24.958 --> 1:11:28.460
Ooh. D-D-Damn, son.

1:11:28.462 --> 1:11:31.363
I'm glad you guys didn't --
didn't fall for that, though.

1:11:31.365 --> 1:11:34.333
We may not be smart,
but we very well be very dumb!

1:11:34.335 --> 1:11:37.101
We're very good
at being dumb.

1:11:37.103 --> 1:11:38.704
Look, I'm sorry, y'all.

1:11:38.706 --> 1:11:42.073
I forgot what was important
in life -- friendship.

1:11:42.075 --> 1:11:45.277
And even though most of this
is not my fault,

1:11:45.279 --> 1:11:47.446
I'll pretend like it was
if you'll have me back.

1:11:47.448 --> 1:11:50.948
Oh, how I wish it were
that simple, Fry man.

1:11:50.950 --> 1:11:53.185
But the existing Aqua Teens

1:11:53.187 --> 1:11:55.421
will need to convene
and vote on --

1:11:55.423 --> 1:11:56.954
Put your hands down,
Carl!

1:11:56.956 --> 1:11:59.324
Your pits stink and you're not
an official Aqua Teen!

1:11:59.326 --> 1:12:01.260
And, Meatwad,
you're on probation

1:12:01.262 --> 1:12:02.795
until you pay those dues.

1:12:02.797 --> 1:12:05.798
So we're back together?
I mean, we're cool, right?

1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:07.266
Uh...

1:12:07.268 --> 1:12:10.669
Your apology doesn't exactly
put food in my mouth.

1:12:10.671 --> 1:12:12.704
Yes, food.
What shall we eat?

1:12:12.706 --> 1:12:15.006
-I, too, am hungry.
-Yeah we're all hungry actually.

1:12:15.008 --> 1:12:16.275
-Yes!
-Yes, we're all hungry.

1:12:16.277 --> 1:12:17.643
I think we're all
pretty hungry.

1:12:17.645 --> 1:12:20.279
Well, I mean,
ain't you guys made of food?

1:12:20.281 --> 1:12:22.481
French fries, milkshake,
and he's all meat.

1:12:22.483 --> 1:12:24.316
Smells really good.

1:12:24.318 --> 1:12:26.552
Whoa. Hey, how about
a little space?

1:12:26.554 --> 1:12:29.053
The Aqua Teens
are together again.

1:12:29.055 --> 1:12:30.255
Ow, damn it.

1:12:30.257 --> 1:12:32.157
Mmm!
Oh, he's good, y'all!

1:12:32.159 --> 1:12:34.660
-Eat them!
-Eat them!

1:12:38.965 --> 1:12:41.233
You paid for
a full-length movie

1:12:41.235 --> 1:12:43.669
and you only got
75 minutes.

1:12:43.671 --> 1:12:45.036
Oh, man!

1:12:45.038 --> 1:12:47.539
And that is counting
this extended credits,

1:12:47.541 --> 1:12:49.508
which is really
just pulled out of our asses.

1:12:49.510 --> 1:12:51.376
Yeah, man, I'm in there
like seven times.

1:12:51.378 --> 1:12:52.778
I'm listed as
a producer twice.

1:12:52.780 --> 1:12:54.646
They're just using that
to fill space, man,

1:12:54.648 --> 1:12:56.348
because nobody worked
on this.

1:12:56.350 --> 1:12:58.917
Did you think you were gonna
get an extended cut?

1:12:58.919 --> 1:13:00.686
We're not Judd Apatow.

1:13:00.688 --> 1:13:03.455
Look, here, here, here, here,
here, here, here, here.

1:13:03.457 --> 1:13:05.757
Over and over and over.
Everything "Err."

1:13:05.759 --> 1:13:08.427
And you're still watching
the extended credits.

1:13:08.429 --> 1:13:10.329
If you were gonna
look at words,

1:13:10.331 --> 1:13:12.297
why won't you
just read a book?

1:13:12.299 --> 1:13:15.032
Read my book.
It's called "I Rule Your Movie."

1:13:15.034 --> 1:13:16.635
Oh, look at the time.

1:13:16.637 --> 1:13:18.437
You'll have to rent
something else...
Ha ha ha!

1:13:18.439 --> 1:13:21.507
...to provide more entertainment
for your date

1:13:21.509 --> 1:13:25.210
while you awkwardly put your arm
on her shoulder,

1:13:25.212 --> 1:13:28.714
your jizz-shellacked paws
flaking off on her blouse

1:13:28.716 --> 1:13:32.083
as she makes any excuse
to get away from you.

1:13:32.085 --> 1:13:33.752
Your dick is your date.

1:13:33.754 --> 1:13:34.953
That's right, Err.

1:13:34.955 --> 1:13:36.822
Don't put too fine
a point on it.

1:13:36.824 --> 1:13:41.058
We are gender-specific because
we know no women watch us.

1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:43.027
Go on.
Find another movie.

1:13:43.029 --> 1:13:45.531
Fill the hours
before you slowly crawl

1:13:45.533 --> 1:13:48.433
back into your bed
alone again.

1:13:48.435 --> 1:13:51.035
Yeah! Go get a snack. How about
a big old jug of grease?

1:13:51.037 --> 1:13:54.006
Yes. Yes.
You have promises to keep

1:13:54.008 --> 1:13:56.408
and pounds of grease
to eat

1:13:56.410 --> 1:13:58.143
before you sleep...
Dumb consumer.

1:13:58.145 --> 1:14:00.145
...alone again.

1:14:06.153 --> 1:14:09.021
♪ Get, get money,
get the money ♪

1:14:10.691 --> 1:14:11.890
♪ Yo ♪

1:14:15.796 --> 1:14:17.029
♪ Yo ♪

1:14:17.031 --> 1:14:19.933
♪ Get, get money,
get the money ♪♪

1:15:11.052 --> 1:15:13.586
Ooh, don't forget
the crispies.

1:15:13.588 --> 1:15:15.788
There you go. Tap the bottom.
Tap, tap, tap.

1:15:15.790 --> 1:15:18.758
There you go.
Don't want to waste one.

1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:20.560
-That's actually very good.
-Delicious.

1:15:20.562 --> 1:15:22.595
I feel guilty. You know,
we were neighbors once,

1:15:22.597 --> 1:15:25.765
but, uh, hey, if you don't want
to get eaten, don't be food.

1:15:25.767 --> 1:15:26.933
That's the way I see it.

1:15:26.935 --> 1:15:28.935
You know, I would drink
your blood, Carl,

1:15:28.937 --> 1:15:32.605
but, really, what I'm
in the mood for is...

1:15:32.607 --> 1:15:34.307
ice cream!

1:15:34.309 --> 1:15:36.943
Mmm.

1:15:36.945 --> 1:15:39.412
Ice cream
is the life.

1:15:39.414 --> 1:15:42.248
I smell a sequel!
