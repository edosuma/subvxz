WEBVTT

00:42.084 --> 00:44.127
It's smooth, it's brown.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.380
Now, Sinatra drinks it.
Why shouldn't you?

00:49.425 --> 00:51.551
This bulging?

00:51.635 --> 00:53.136
No.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.221
Can you get somebody to clean up
the loose chips on the bar?

00:55.305 --> 00:57.849
It's messy. And if I decide
I want to spill some during the bit,

00:57.933 --> 01:00.601
it's not going to be funny
if there's already some there.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.978
Going again.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.021
Rolling. Sound, speed.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.441
"Utz Are Better Than Nuts"
bar scene, take 6.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.068
Action.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.781
Imagine my horror when
a night on the town turned ugly.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.950
This is a nice place for nice people,

01:16.076 --> 01:19.412
and the jerk behind the bar,
he throws a bowl of nuts at me.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.621
What am I, a squirrel?

01:22.082 --> 01:25.376
Well, lucky for him,
I bring my own whereνer I go.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.628
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.506
Just you try and stick your face
into a can of nuts.

01:32.551 --> 01:33.718
Take it from a nut.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.386
Utz are better than nuts.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.057
Don't cut. No. I want to do that again.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.770
Roll the camera over that way 5 feet
and come in around the lapels.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.315
Quiet, please.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.066
Still rolling.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.819
Just try sticking your face
into a can of nuts.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.121
Here we are in Lakehurst, New Jersey,

02:02.206 --> 02:03.581
watching as the great airship Hindenburg

02:03.665 --> 02:05.833
attempts to tie off its mooring mast and--

02:05.918 --> 02:08.085
Oh, my God!
She suddenly burst into flames!

02:08.170 --> 02:09.670
Oh, God! Look at the size of it!

02:09.755 --> 02:12.465
It's horrible! Oh, the humanity!

02:12.549 --> 02:14.258
Hey, get Sitting Bull on the phone.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.843
We found the last buffalo.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.430
Hey, get a wider lens, right?

02:19.515 --> 02:20.765
We want to shoot her in CinemaFat.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.934
Hey, Jimmy, what do you say
we take a little break?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.519
Open your mouth, sweetheart.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.979
I want to see if Gepetto's
building a fire in there.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.857
That man is an animal.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.986
Jesus, Jimmy.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.531
Just for your information,
this guy's laughing over here.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.799
Are you going right home?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.135
No.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.554
I have marketing.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.806
I have to pick up Don's watch.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.267
- You bought Don a watch?
- I got it repaired.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.977
He was bathing the kids with it.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.979
I've been looking for one for Raymond.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.982
- We're coming up on 1 0, you know.
- 1 0?

03:11.066 --> 03:13.901
Poor man has to think of something
for the girl who has everything.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.987
Did you make any suggestions?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.947
I do love your car.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.824
That's not romantic.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.327
Did you hear the part
where I said 1 0 years?

03:23.412 --> 03:25.454
I shouldn't be saying that.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.210
He looks like a little boy.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.587
I guess.

03:32.671 --> 03:36.048
He reminds me of Monty Clift
in A Place in the Sun,

03:36.133 --> 03:39.635
learning how to ride so he can
worm his way into the upper crust.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.346
Somewhere there's a pregnant girl
floating in a lake.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.391
I'm from the South.
There are such people.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.188
I think he needs a different horse.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.691
He's on the worst one we have.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.859
I apologize.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.570
l knew it would be a challenge,
or I would have done it myself.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.864
Thank you, Gertie.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.783
You have to admit-- he is handsome.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.870
He's got that going for him.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.830
Shall we?

04:09.291 --> 04:10.374
I have to get my purse.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.876
No. You're not going anywhere.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.170
We have to meet her.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.714
Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Carson,

04:16.798 --> 04:18.674
this is Tara Montague, my fiancée.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.593
Sarah Beth Carson.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.719
Betty Draper.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.721
You must be the ladies he rides with.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.681
We're among them.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.017
Artie, are you the rooster around here?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.061
I think they make fun of me.

04:30.145 --> 04:33.564
We don't. That would be cruel.

04:33.649 --> 04:36.275
Well, I've done plenty of things for him.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.986
And I'd love to continue doing so.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.906
Pleased to meet you.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.411
She's pretty.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.996
Very pretty.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.748
Prettier than I expected.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.334
I think she's about right.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.921
I spend too much time here.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.881
I actually dreamt about him.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.466
I think it was him,

05:00.550 --> 05:02.426
or a version of him that could ride.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.054
I'll see you Saturday.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.431
No. You'll haνe him to yourself on Saturday.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.517
Becky has a dance recital.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.144
lt's so horrible to put
girls that fat in a leotard.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.605
Stop. She'll outgrow it.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.065
She did.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.159
Happy Thursday, Mr. Crane.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.327
Thank you.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.496
You'νe neνer opened
one of these, have you?

05:35.544 --> 05:36.836
Hey, Todd.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.007
Yes, Mr. Crane?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.425
Nothing. Get the door, will you?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.928
Damn it.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.156
Whoa.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.533
You in the middle of something?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.040
We're going to the Oyster Bar.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.209
Yeah. I'm not hungry.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.556
Hello.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.350
Good. You are home.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.726
Never got any better.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.353
I almost threw up waiting for our elevator

07:17.437 --> 07:19.688
and then just came back
and got undressed.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.398
Sorry.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.735
But aren't you sweet to call
and check up on me.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.199
Harry?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.575
What's wrong?

07:31.660 --> 07:34.286
You told me you wanted me
to tell me if I was upset.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.372
What did I do?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.581
Oh, no, honey.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.083
No, it's nothing.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.084
You do sound upset.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.293
Something is wrong.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.753
Harry, do l want to hear this?

07:42.838 --> 07:45.089
Would you stop? Let me talk?

07:45.173 --> 07:47.633
Okay. Were you fired?

07:48.885 --> 07:51.595
I accidentally opened
Ken Cosgrove's paycheck.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.264
So?

07:53.348 --> 07:54.598
What's he gonna care?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.100
Tampering with the U.S. mail?

07:56.184 --> 07:57.726
He makes 300 a week.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.605
What? That mannequin
makes $300 a week?

08:01.690 --> 08:02.731
He's not married.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.275
We have one on the way.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.402
I hate this place.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.611
I should quit.

08:07.696 --> 08:08.988
That's your response?

08:09.072 --> 08:10.447
The hours you work?

08:10.532 --> 08:12.199
Forget about Kenny.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.827
If they have that much money to spend,
they should spend it on you.

08:14.911 --> 08:15.995
You're making that place.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.914
I don't know about that.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.791
What are you worth?

08:20.876 --> 08:23.335
You go in there and ask for it.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.628
Demand it.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.132
Be polite, but think about
what you're worth to them.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.968
No. No, I can't do that.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.138
I didn't know this was about
you feeling sorry for yourself.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.514
I'm hanging up.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.975
Do you know where I can get
a number 1 0 envelope

08:38.059 --> 08:40.227
with a windowpane
and a green stripe on the side?

08:40.312 --> 08:42.813
No.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.565
I need to lay down.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.150
Yeah. Right.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.027
Well, feel better.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.077
Do you have a number 1 0 envelope
with a windowpane?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.453
No. Why?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.913
Can you make one?

09:41.957 --> 09:43.832
No. Why?

09:48.838 --> 09:49.922
Can you fix this one?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.590
Make it so it can look unopened?

09:51.675 --> 09:53.384
You need a fake passport, too?

09:53.468 --> 09:56.720
I got Ken Cosgroνe's paycheck by mistake.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.805
I opened it.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.556
How did that happen?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.350
A mistake.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.852
Well, just throw it away.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.896
He'll ask for it by the end of the day,

10:05.981 --> 10:07.273
and they'll cut him a new one.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.524
Don't throw it away here, though.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.733
People go through the trash.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.360
Of course.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.321
Are you upset about getting caught?

10:15.991 --> 10:17.950
Or are you upset about what you saw?

10:18.034 --> 10:21.120
I don't know if this
would mean much to you.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.913
It's 300 a week before taxes.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.254
We're married.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.299
I have a baby due in August.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.425
You know what Jennifer said?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.635
She thinks that l should just go in
and demand a raise.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.387
You told your wife about this?

10:39.681 --> 10:42.057
I know. I do that. I keep doing it.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.393
- I didn't know what to do.
- There's nothing you can do.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.979
That's why you don't tell your wife.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.605
Wish you hadn't told me.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.232
I think she's right.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.443
But isn't Media a meritocracy?

10:52.527 --> 10:53.527
You think that?

10:54.696 --> 10:55.988
What's that supposed to mean, anyway?

10:56.072 --> 10:57.281
I have plenty of merit.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.117
Merit defined within reason.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.995
As in this place can't run without you?

11:04.039 --> 11:05.497
Well, how the hell do l do that?

11:07.042 --> 11:09.585
Then you're worth every
penny they're paying you.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.129
Thanks, Sal.

11:17.761 --> 11:22.181
Mr. Draper, Mr. Sterling and Ben Cosgrove
are here to see you.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.265
Ken.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.641
Bad news.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.144
So bad l don't feel like telling you.
Cosgroνe.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.190
We were shooting Jimmy Barrett
for Utz, and--

11:31.274 --> 11:33.400
Don't pussyfoot around.
Just tell him.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.361
I'm trying to tell him.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.529
- Give me a cigarette.
- Yes, sir.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.697
Why don't you get your own?

11:38.782 --> 11:40.366
We have a whole storeroom
full of Luckys.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.242
Because I don't smoke.

11:42.327 --> 11:45.162
Mr. and Mrs. Schilling
made a surprise visit to the set,

11:45.246 --> 11:47.331
and they got the full
Jimmy Barrett treatment.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.833
Mr. Rumsen's coming in.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.293
I don't care that you drink, Freddie,

11:51.378 --> 11:53.253
- but it's interfering with your job.
- Whoa.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.631
Only an idiot would put
Jimmy Barrett in a room with her.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.924
No visits.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.258
How bad was it?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.553
He called her the Hindenburg.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.598
And he said something
about the whale in Pinocchio.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.438
Did you laugh in front of the Schillings?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.023
Of course not. I was mortified.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.358
You know, my mother's heavyset.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.734
I stopped it right away.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.737
So what we're dealing with here
is you failed to control Jimmy Barrett,

12:18.822 --> 12:20.489
and you failed to control Mr. and Mrs. Utz,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.700
so maybe both of you
aren't suited for these tasks.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.286
- Mr. Phillips is here.
- Perfect.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.125
Utz is gonna lose Jimmy,
and we're going to lose Utz.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.127
Oh, God. I miss the '50s.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.547
Has anyone tried to save this yet
besides Leopold and Loeb oνer here?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.090
Can't get the Schillings on the phone.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.591
Someone needs to talk to Jimmy.

12:39.676 --> 12:43.053
Well, I'm sure he'll feel real bad
about it tonight and give her a call.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.055
Don, can you work him over?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.266
Jimmy Barrett is a known quantity.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.934
Don's going to fix it.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.728
He knows what that nut means to Utz
and what Utz means to us.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.188
Fix what, exactly?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.566
Fix this mess that was made
because Freddie got him drunk.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.527
Come on. Cosgrove should have
told me they were here.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.154
I would have never let her near that set.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.905
I did. I told Lois.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.657
I took them by here, but you were out.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.708
I'm going to talk to the Schillings,

13:12.792 --> 13:15.544
then I'm going to explain
the facts of life to Jimmy.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.587
That'll work.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.881
A guy like that must know
how to make a charming apology,

13:18.965 --> 13:20.215
or he'd be dead.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.683
Where were you?

13:30.685 --> 13:32.436
At the printer's.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.522
You should tell your girl that.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.360
Lois.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.991
Close the door.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.163
Sit down.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.248
No. Stand.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.918
I'd like to find a way not to be cruel,

13:56.002 --> 13:58.420
but I don't think it'd be serving
either one of us.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.631
Are you firing me?

14:01.883 --> 14:03.759
Oh, no.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.886
It's nice to see that you care
about something.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.097
Are you trying to think
of what you can possibly say

14:09.182 --> 14:10.474
to make up for what's happened here?

14:10.558 --> 14:11.850
What happened?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.688
I think you're not suited for this job.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.483
What did I do?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.318
In addition to being incompetent,

14:21.402 --> 14:23.654
you threatened my reputation,
and not just today.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.323
Mr. Draper, I try to cover
for you all the time.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.867
You do not cover for me.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.161
You manage people's expectations.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.498
Can you be more specific?

14:34.582 --> 14:35.666
You really want that?

14:35.750 --> 14:38.669
No, l guess not.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.420
You're not suited for this job.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.590
It's not an insult. It's just the way it is.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.596
Stick to the switchboard.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.890
Please tell Miss Holloway on your way out.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.226
Yes, Mr. Draper.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.654
Is there something due
tomorrow l don't know about?

15:05.738 --> 15:06.655
No.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.913
Already finding ways
not to go home, are we?

15:22.171 --> 15:24.631
Edgar Fladen, CBS, please.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.093
- Hello.
- Flatty.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.219
Harry Crane. How are you?

15:29.304 --> 15:31.555
Still at work, same as you.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.889
How you like it over there?

15:32.974 --> 15:36.643
Did Sterling Coo lose
some of its drunken luster?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.061
I don't know.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.731
I was thinking maybe I have
to move out to moνe up.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.733
Well, forget about here.
They're picking us off.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.151
I'm one gone paleface.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.278
Well, thought I'd ask.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.071
Keep your ear to the ground
for me, will you?

15:48.156 --> 15:50.907
- It doesn't have to be there.
- Hey, how about some concern?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.909
I just lost Lever Brothers
and Kimberly Clark

15:52.994 --> 15:54.161
from one of my biggest shows.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.538
We're lousy with sponsors over here.
What do you need?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.914
Don't get excited.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.750
Sponsors drop out for a reason.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.251
Not always.

16:01.336 --> 16:04.087
Okay. Try this on.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.173
The Defenders. Top 20 show.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.674
E.G. Marshall, Bob Reed.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.635
Lawyers, but, you know, they really care.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.638
So the writers turn in this script
about a cannibal.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.681
A cannibal lawyer?

16:16.059 --> 16:18.935
The director eats up all this time
refusing to do it,

16:19.020 --> 16:21.146
like his résumé isn't filled with crap,

16:21.230 --> 16:24.608
and surprise, the writers haνe
only one other script ready--

16:24.692 --> 16:27.194
something we threw away last year

16:27.278 --> 16:32.449
because they used the word "abortion"
30 times in 51 minutes.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.784
Why?

16:33.868 --> 16:36.286
Because they show one, opening scene.

16:37.789 --> 16:38.955
Exactly.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.124
The whole thing was a ploy
to get us to shoot it.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.043
They think they're so clever.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.003
I tell you, l miss the blacklist.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.798
Send it oνer. l want to see it.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.091
I'm sure.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.634
It's going on the air, sponsor or no.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.303
I'll watch it with you in the bar
where l'll be working.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.347
Send it over.
Let me see what l can do.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.556
All right.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.438
Miss Holloway, good morning.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.316
l will be taking care of you
while we search for a suitable candidate.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.485
I am really sorry about that.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.654
Did she leaνe everything
in a condition you can follow?

17:10.738 --> 17:14.199
Perhaps if you were involved
in the selection.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.492
What can I tell?

17:15.576 --> 17:18.203
I'll just continue looking
for another Miss Olson.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.664
No. I want someone
who'll be happy with that job.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.417
Well, for the time being, that's me.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.835
How about a cup of coffee?

17:24.919 --> 17:26.503
I think I remember how you take it.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.587
Sure.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.340
Is Jimmy Barrett shooting today?

17:30.425 --> 17:32.092
Yes. At EUE.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.011
What time do they start?

17:35.096 --> 17:36.346
They were supposed to start this morning,

17:36.431 --> 17:37.889
but Mr. Barrett's been showing up around 4.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.808
Wake me at 3:30.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.602
We'll start with your correspondence.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.857
Did you go to that office

17:46.941 --> 17:49.693
for the purpose of obtaining
an illegal operation?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.695
Yes.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.363
Were you pregnant?

17:53.448 --> 17:54.865
Yes.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.868
Then you went to Dr. Montgomery
for an abortion.

17:57.952 --> 17:58.994
Yes.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.829
Was the abortion performed?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.038
Just a moment.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.875
Mr. Preston, aren't you going to object?

18:04.959 --> 18:07.502
The witness is not
a qualified medical expert.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.045
The defense is willing to concede

18:09.130 --> 18:11.006
that an operation was performed
on Miss Stafford,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.216
which resulted in the termination
of a pregnancy.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.302
Very well. You may proceed.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.769
Come here a lot, do you?

18:23.853 --> 18:26.229
Not if everything's running smoothly.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.939
So buy me a drink.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.442
I think there's been plenty of drinking here.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.235
Jimmy around?

18:32.320 --> 18:35.489
He left early. Rehearsal at the Copa.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.573
Forgot this.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.241
Isn't that our tuxedo?

18:38.326 --> 18:39.951
He likes it better.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.913
Great. So let's go talk to him.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.165
There's no reason for that.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.876
Talk to his manager.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.127
How can I help you?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.798
I'm sorry.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.258
In the pitch, you were
introduced as his wife.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.720
Would you prefer l pretend to be his sister,
like l did in the old days?

18:58.805 --> 19:02.599
Wife, manager, someone should have
kept a lid on him yesterday.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.685
I've seen the man sober.
He's not funny.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.771
- Mrs. Barrett--
- Bobbie.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.982
He can come in here with vomit
in his pockets for all I care,

19:11.067 --> 19:13.735
but these people are his benefactors.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.780
Like the Medicis of Florence,

19:16.864 --> 19:18.740
they're patrons of his art.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.826
Mr. and Mrs. Utz.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.872
I want you to imagine something
that Jimmy obviously can't.

19:25.957 --> 19:30.126
The Schillings were very excited
to see their favorite comedian.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.296
Then they know that being picked on
by Jimmy Barrett is a compliment.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.173
No one was laughing.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.801
That's not what I heard.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.427
I'll tell you what.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.137
They're in the big city for the weekend.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.807
Why don't they just go out
and buy a thicker skin?

19:47.562 --> 19:50.564
You are aware that all of this
can go away.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.984
No more free tuxedos?

19:54.068 --> 19:56.236
We have a contract.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.239
Tell Jimmy I need to talk to him.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.241
You?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.452
Jimmy doesn't have a lot
of patience for business

20:04.537 --> 20:05.996
or for businessmen.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.124
ln fact, I'm pretty sure
he already hates you.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.959
Really?

20:11.043 --> 20:14.838
Some glib ad man in that suit,

20:14.922 --> 20:18.091
cigarette perfectly in hand,
not a hair out of place,

20:18.217 --> 20:20.302
here to tell him he's been a bad boy?

20:20.386 --> 20:22.804
Well, he has been.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.931
So what do you suggest I do?

20:27.435 --> 20:29.394
Well...

20:29.478 --> 20:31.229
he has to know that you're a fan

20:31.314 --> 20:34.858
and that he knows more than you

20:34.942 --> 20:36.693
and that he's got a shot with your wife.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.695
Girlfriend? Both?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.072
Wife.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.576
So who's gonna have
a talk with him, you or me?

20:44.660 --> 20:46.244
Neither of us.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.121
I have to go.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.291
Let me drive you over.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.044
Give up, will you?

20:55.129 --> 20:57.005
It's raining.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.165
What's that?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.001
Hail.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.187
I don't want to do this.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.526
Doesn't feel that way.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.126
Hi, Daddy.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.961
Hey, you.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.170
How was work?

22:20.715 --> 22:22.215
Fine.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.678
Can I ask Daddy?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.139
What do you want?

22:34.437 --> 22:35.979
I'm fine.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.274
You can ask him, but he's not
gonna disagree with me.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.651
Ask me what?

22:43.237 --> 22:46.197
Can we go riding
with Mommy on Saturday?

22:49.744 --> 22:50.744
No.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.622
There are just gonna be mommies there.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.957
I'll need you to watch them.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.793
- It's a couple of hours.
- Okay.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.336
But she promised.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.255
"She"?

23:03.257 --> 23:05.550
Not this Saturday. It didn't work out.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.846
You can ride me around the den.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.266
I picked up your watch. Good as new.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.021
Open it.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.733
I got it monogrammed.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.074
Wow, Bets.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.577
Thank you.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.250
What are you doing?

24:20.334 --> 24:21.918
I think she's out of gas.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.253
Thought I'd fill her up.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.755
They feed them in the barn.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.174
You're ruining that horse
for whoeνer has her next.

24:28.259 --> 24:29.259
I want it on record.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.970
She was ruined when I got to her.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.305
Just pull up on the reins.
Straighten her out.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.392
You can't let her do that.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.145
You don't for a minute think
you might be hurting her?

24:40.229 --> 24:43.064
She needs to be told what to do.
Don't be afraid.

24:43.149 --> 24:46.818
I'm not afraid, but l am curious
why I'm riding Nehi

24:46.902 --> 24:49.112
and you've got Copenhagen.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.281
Some horses have better names.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.659
Where's your girl friend, Mrs. Carson?

24:54.743 --> 24:58.454
Her daughter has a ballet recital.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.582
I'm really not afraid, you know?

25:00.666 --> 25:02.500
I've just always been more
comfortable with animals

25:02.585 --> 25:04.627
when they were on
the other end of my rifle.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.588
That's a terrible attitude.

25:06.672 --> 25:10.466
It is, and I've tried to explain it to Tara,
but she won't listen.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.803
All the men in her family ride like this.

25:13.888 --> 25:17.682
They also don't work,
so maybe I'm wrong about it.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.018
I should go warm him up.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.311
Tally-ho.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.908
I'll be right back.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.358
Hello.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.527
Hello. lt's Don Draper.

26:11.612 --> 26:12.862
Can you talk?

26:12.947 --> 26:15.240
I'm glad you called.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.243
How are you?

26:18.327 --> 26:19.827
Weren't you afraid you'd get Jimmy?

26:19.912 --> 26:22.080
No. l wanted to invite you both to dinner.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.332
Monday night.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.001
A command performance.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.544
I was thinking Lutèce.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.047
It will be formal. Can you get him there?

26:31.131 --> 26:34.092
I told you. He does whatever I say.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.176
Keep it smalI.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.096
My wife, the Schillings, you.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.266
Okay. If that's what you want.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.396
What do you want?

26:47.982 --> 26:49.482
So...

26:51.318 --> 26:54.070
it's that kind of phone call, is it?

26:54.154 --> 26:55.363
Where are you?

26:57.116 --> 26:58.741
In my home.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.994
With my children.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.620
Really?

27:04.498 --> 27:07.625
I like being bad and then
going home and being good.

27:10.004 --> 27:11.504
I'll see you Monday.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.674
Have a wonderful weekend.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.661
Did you haνe a nice ride?

27:45.414 --> 27:47.623
Don't smoke in here. They hate it.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.125
I don't know.

27:49.209 --> 27:52.211
Place burns down, I could give this up.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.797
I assume you're trying to be funny,
but most of the people who ride--

27:54.882 --> 27:55.882
Hold on.

27:55.966 --> 27:59.469
Mrs. Draper, I'm so sorry.
That's not what I meant.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.970
Just because you don't know
what you're doing

28:01.055 --> 28:02.555
doesn't mean the rest of us are silly.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.183
I apologize.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.311
Girls and their horses.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.147
I can't figure you out.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.650
Why would you want to do that?

28:14.735 --> 28:17.236
When Tara came to visit,
I could tell she was jealous.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.657
Of your two old lady friends.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.826
She certainly seems like
a girl who has everything.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.244
She does.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.371
When she was at Wellesley,

28:26.455 --> 28:28.831
she came for a couple
of weekends to New Haven.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.583
I remember those.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.001
So exciting.

28:32.086 --> 28:36.172
We got into a kind of pattern
where there'd be a warm reunion,

28:36.256 --> 28:40.218
a football game, and some kind
of obscure argument.

28:40.302 --> 28:43.888
You know, I would soothe
and she would pout.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.141
You know, Mr. Case,
having been married for some time,

28:47.226 --> 28:49.394
I can tell you your fiancée
would be very unhappy

28:49.478 --> 28:51.479
with you sharing this with a stranger.

28:52.606 --> 28:53.481
Arthur.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.694
I don't know why I brought that up.

28:58.779 --> 29:02.490
I guess l just remembered going home
with her that first time.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.368
Pulling off the Merritt Parkway
and hitting this long, private road.

29:05.452 --> 29:09.038
You know that Scott Fitzgerald story,
A Diamond as Big as the Ritz?

29:09.123 --> 29:10.540
No.

29:10.624 --> 29:14.710
Her house is a slightly smaller version
of my high school.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.422
And I realized why she was
so happy all the time

29:17.506 --> 29:20.883
and why she was so angry
when she didn't get what she wanted.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.969
All girls are like that.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.263
- You aren't.
- You don't know that.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.058
You are so beautiful.

29:29.143 --> 29:30.893
Thank you.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.562
So different than Tara.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.897
Tara is very beautiful. You know that.

29:34.982 --> 29:37.400
She doesn't need anything.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.985
What she does need, anyone can get her.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.239
You're nervous about getting married.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.408
You'll see.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.076
You don't know what she'll mean to you.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.495
But I think about you.

29:51.165 --> 29:52.790
Why would you do that?

29:54.501 --> 29:57.587
Arthur, l like being around you.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.088
Don't say anything to ruin that.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.013
You're so profoundly sad.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.098
No.

30:09.183 --> 30:11.642
It's just my people are Nordic.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.731
Don't do that.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.859
Don't tell me what to do.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.034
You're so profoundly sad.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.080
You're wrong.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.293
I'm grateful.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.161
Hey.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.913
How was it?

31:13.997 --> 31:15.748
I'm sorry l'm late.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.500
Thank you for watching them.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.043
Come in here.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.503
I should get cleaned up.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.879
I don't care.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.422
Listen.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.133
How do you feel about
Lutèce Monday night?

31:29.638 --> 31:31.013
Lutèce?

31:32.766 --> 31:34.350
Pleased, l guess.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.811
And you get to meet Jimmy Barrett.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.649
Why?

31:41.733 --> 31:42.775
Business.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.612
Hunt Schilling from
Utz Potato Chips and wiνes.

31:46.697 --> 31:50.074
Is this one where I talk or I don't talk?

31:50.158 --> 31:51.993
You need to charm him.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.036
I need you to be shiny and bright.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.454
I need a better half.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.373
Monday night.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.541
You have plans?

31:58.625 --> 32:00.876
I'll haνe to find something to wear.

32:00.961 --> 32:03.254
It's no notice. No notice at all.

32:03.338 --> 32:07.133
Birdie, we'll go there alone another time.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.730
What is it?

32:20.814 --> 32:23.774
What is it?
What's this got to do with you?

32:26.695 --> 32:29.155
"He helped me," says Sam.

32:30.824 --> 32:33.075
Is this you?

32:33.160 --> 32:34.744
They're writing this about you?

32:34.828 --> 32:37.246
Answer me!
Are you mixed up in this?

32:37.331 --> 32:39.248
- Answer me!
- Mr. Mason.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.792
You keep out of this!

32:41.877 --> 32:43.878
Sandra Mason.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.755
I was reading about this.

32:45.839 --> 32:48.633
I was thanking God that my daughter

32:48.717 --> 32:50.593
wasn't the kind of a girl that was--

32:50.677 --> 32:53.596
would be mixed up
in anything ugly like this.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.556
Please, Daddy, don't.

32:55.641 --> 32:59.477
I was even feeling sorry for the parents
of the girls who were involved.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.312
- Please. Please.
- Please?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.606
1 8 years old!

33:03.690 --> 33:05.107
You have to have an illegitimate child

33:05.192 --> 33:08.486
taken away from you by some filthy doctor!

33:08.570 --> 33:09.987
Mr. Mason!

33:10.072 --> 33:12.615
You get out of my house!

33:12.699 --> 33:16.077
I do want to see the rest of this,
but I get the idea.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.828
Then behave as though you--

33:20.624 --> 33:23.959
Top 20 show, prime time,
for pennies on the dollar.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.462
And it's the perfect match
for Belle Jolie lipstick.

33:26.546 --> 33:29.006
Really? How does that work?

33:29.091 --> 33:31.592
Controversy means viewers.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.553
Women will find a way to watch this.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.472
Maybe just because
they don't want to get left out.

33:36.556 --> 33:37.890
Is that true?

33:40.394 --> 33:42.978
There's no doubt in my mind.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.647
We can talk to them
about putting on a warning.

33:44.731 --> 33:48.150
Research shows rules
are made to be broken.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.319
Thanks, Ken. He has the research.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.571
This discussion, it's uncomfortable.

33:52.656 --> 33:53.948
This show is troubling.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.993
It's catharsis. That's hard to come by.

33:58.078 --> 34:02.206
What is better than tears to make a girl
ready to hear she can be beautiful?

34:02.290 --> 34:04.166
I'd love to see a spike.

34:04.251 --> 34:07.837
But what do I do when Hugh Brody
asks what the hell this is?

34:07.921 --> 34:10.214
Belle Jolie is a family company.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.174
This is not wholesome.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.302
There are limits to what
you can get out of daytime.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.389
l don't want Belle Jolie
to be part of this debate.

34:18.473 --> 34:21.434
So you think girls who buy lipstick
aren't gonna be interested in this?

34:22.602 --> 34:25.062
I don't care where they stand.
So it's political.

34:25.147 --> 34:27.773
Politics are in.
Women will be watching.

34:27.858 --> 34:29.567
Young women.

34:29.651 --> 34:30.943
I'm sorry.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.781
Well, we thought you should know about it.

34:38.076 --> 34:42.079
I have to say I'm very impressed
you brought this to us.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.706
I wish we were
a different kind of company.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.750
We all work for someone.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.421
It was a pleasure.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.716
How's it going?

34:53.800 --> 34:54.800
Very well, thank you.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.234
You said you wanted to see me?

35:12.319 --> 35:13.903
Yes, I did.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.571
You're Harry Crane, right?

35:15.655 --> 35:16.989
Yes, I am.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.117
Certain things have come to my attention.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.619
Oh, no.

35:21.703 --> 35:24.079
I heard about it third-hand,
and l thought it sounded reckless,

35:24.164 --> 35:25.748
so I talked to Mr. Cooper.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.416
Mr. Cooper knows about this?

35:27.501 --> 35:29.126
I think someone told on you.

35:29.211 --> 35:31.253
And it backfired.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.130
- Mitch.
- Doesn't matter.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.216
Cooper thought it showed initiative.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.134
So you're in here now.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.344
I'm smiling. What do you want?

35:42.682 --> 35:44.183
Well...

35:44.267 --> 35:46.310
I guess, for one thing,

35:46.394 --> 35:48.062
I think that we should have
a teleνision department.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.231
All the other agencies haνe them.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.774
And l think I should run it.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.319
You're now the head
of the Television Department,

35:55.403 --> 35:56.654
which is comprised solely of you.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.239
Anything else?

35:59.699 --> 36:01.909
Well, actually...

36:01.993 --> 36:03.536
I think I deserve a raise.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.298
And l think...

36:16.383 --> 36:18.801
you've already received a sizable reward.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.636
Let's not get greedy.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.720
I'm not being greedy.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.722
Are you arguing with me?

36:25.433 --> 36:26.851
How much do you make?

36:26.935 --> 36:29.353
- $200 a week.
- Plus drinks.

36:31.898 --> 36:32.940
Give me a number.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.819
How about 31 0?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.655
No one makes that around here.
Not even close.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.032
How about two and a quarter? Say yes.

36:43.243 --> 36:44.827
Yes.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.036
I'll throw in new business cards.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.746
You driνe a hell of a bargain.

36:58.592 --> 37:01.176
So I finally told them
that we really enjoyed νisiting,

37:01.261 --> 37:03.345
but we'd rather stay in a hotel.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.931
Made my daughter-in-law happier.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.351
Luckily, we're a long way
from those problems.

37:09.436 --> 37:11.854
Although, I do love the idea
of Bobby and Sally

37:11.938 --> 37:14.315
having apartments and families.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.775
Where is he?

37:18.278 --> 37:19.862
Who?

37:21.448 --> 37:23.198
Jimmy Barrett.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.035
I...

37:26.119 --> 37:27.953
No, Hunt.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.872
I don't think
that would be a good idea.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.457
Edith, please.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.793
He wants to apologize.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.923
Oh, dear.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.508
Well, he certainly picked a nice place.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.055
Hello, everybody.
Sorry we're late,

37:46.139 --> 37:48.015
but one of us likes
to make an entrance.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.017
Hello. Bobbie Barrett.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.685
Pleasure.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.938
- We'νe met before.
- I remember.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.272
Mr. Draper.

37:56.358 --> 37:58.233
This is my wife Betty.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.653
Betty, this is
Bobbie and Jimmy Barrett.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.698
Oh, my. I am such a fan.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.909
You know, when you imagine
someone saying that to you,

38:06.993 --> 38:09.578
you always hope it's her.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.081
And this one. My God.
Are you two sold separately?

38:12.165 --> 38:13.415
Look, it's JFK.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.834
And you're not Jackie,
but you're definitely his type.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.086
I've met him.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.170
Nice to see you again, Jimmy.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.255
You remember
Hunt and Edith Schilling.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.091
How could I forget?
They bought me a car.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.342
A pleasure as always.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.511
And the little lady.
Look at you, all dolled up.

38:29.891 --> 38:32.559
So, what do you do, sweetheart?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.770
I want to know eνerything.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.230
I'm a housewife.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.482
I bet little birds
hang up your laundry.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.151
And we have
a little boy and a little girl.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.612
Is that everything? Or you want
to let my imagination run wild?

38:43.697 --> 38:45.781
By the way, l loved you
in Gentleman's Agreement.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.701
Good eνening, mesdames et messieurs.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.787
The chef has prepared many spécialités

38:51.871 --> 38:53.122
which l will haνe the pleasure of--

38:53.206 --> 38:54.164
Just a minute, Monsieur Le Pew.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.708
Any chance we can get a drink order filled?

38:55.792 --> 38:57.626
Sorry, everybody,
but Jimmy's down a quart.

38:57.711 --> 39:00.045
Two Johnnie Walkers, rocks.
Bobbie, you want anything?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.922
Dubonnet with a twist.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.466
And make it fast,
while this place is still French.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.221
I hope you all like spit in your food.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.265
Come on. I come here all the time.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.727
Now, I have a few key
questions for Mrs. America.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.730
Remember, Betsy,
everything's riding on this.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.815
So really, what fills your days?

39:19.899 --> 39:21.316
Eating bonbons?

39:21.401 --> 39:22.985
Hitting tennis balls with the needy?

39:24.279 --> 39:26.947
Actually, I spend a lot
of my time riding horses.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.657
It's really a passion for me.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.159
And for them, I bet.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.995
So, big horses?
Give me an education.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.581
- You don't want to hear about this.
- No, l do.

39:35.665 --> 39:38.000
ls it the beauty pageant thing
where they walk in little bitty steps?

39:38.084 --> 39:39.752
I'll be right back.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.839
No. That's dressage.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.007
I knew that.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.760
It's the same kind of saddle,
but I do jumping.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.095
You two do any jumping?

39:50.180 --> 39:51.180
I'm sorry.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.348
Can you excuse me a moment?

39:53.433 --> 39:55.768
All this talk about horses?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.194
What, are you expecting a Chinese baby?

40:05.278 --> 40:06.403
I don't know what it is,

40:06.488 --> 40:10.157
but one thing I know is it's not Chinese.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.076
We're both very proud of you.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.410
Well, good.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.746
Because a 1 2 1/2% raise
is nothing to sneeze at.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.415
I don't care about the money.

40:18.500 --> 40:22.419
Well...the money's nice.

40:22.504 --> 40:25.547
I just can't wait to go
into the phone company tomorrow

40:25.632 --> 40:27.299
and tell the girls that my husband

40:27.425 --> 40:29.843
is the head of television
at Sterling Cooper.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.428
Do you feel well enough to go in?

40:31.513 --> 40:33.222
Because you don't have to.

40:33.306 --> 40:34.765
You're sweet.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.312
What did you do?

40:40.438 --> 40:44.566
Well, I took this TV show
that no one wanted to sponsor,

40:44.651 --> 40:46.443
and I told one of our clients about it.

40:46.528 --> 40:47.986
And you sold it?

40:48.071 --> 40:52.699
No, but eνeryone was impressed
that I recognized the opportunity.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.535
What's the show?

40:54.619 --> 40:56.370
Just some show.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.459
You wouldn't like it.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.222
You look great.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.099
Do I?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.725
I'm not feeling great.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.644
Why not?

41:20.728 --> 41:22.354
I'm gonna be brief

41:22.480 --> 41:24.773
because I don't like
leaνing him alone out there.

41:24.858 --> 41:26.316
They're loving it.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.153
They're being polite.

41:29.237 --> 41:32.531
The window for this apology is closing.

41:32.615 --> 41:35.784
It needs to happen before the appetizers,
or they will leave.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.078
Really?

41:38.163 --> 41:40.581
Because l was thinking about that,

41:40.665 --> 41:43.167
so I took a look at Jimmy's contract--

41:43.251 --> 41:45.586
well, me and a lawyer--

41:45.670 --> 41:49.256
and I realized Jimmy doesn't
have to apologize at all.

41:49.340 --> 41:53.969
In fact, they're gonna have to pay him,
even if they fire him,

41:54.053 --> 41:57.264
especially because hurt feelings
isn't a very good reason.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.310
So what is this all about?

42:01.394 --> 42:06.106
I think an apology,
and a public one like this one,

42:06.191 --> 42:08.984
has to be worth $25,000.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.819
And I want it in the paper.

42:10.904 --> 42:13.447
Say it's a bonus.

42:26.419 --> 42:30.839
Believe me, I will ruin him.

42:34.636 --> 42:36.303
Do what I say.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.656
- Don't get up.
- I wasn't gonna.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.991
But this one knows about horses.
Who knows?

42:58.076 --> 43:00.494
I've been spending the whole time
watching her lips move.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.588
Well, I hope we haven't ordered yet
because there really is something

43:11.673 --> 43:13.382
that we need to get out of the way.

43:13.466 --> 43:14.800
He's picking up the check.

43:14.884 --> 43:16.468
I mean, there's really no debate, is there?

43:19.597 --> 43:20.931
Mr. and Mrs. Schilling,

43:21.015 --> 43:23.725
Jimmy has something
that he'd like to say to you.

43:32.277 --> 43:35.779
Honestly, I'd rather eat your chips
than anything in this dump.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.281
They have snails here, you know.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.118
That's nice to hear.

43:41.202 --> 43:44.037
Mrs. Schilling-- Edith--

43:44.122 --> 43:45.664
I was out of line the other day.

43:45.748 --> 43:48.458
I shouldn't have said it to you,
and not just 'cause you're married to him.

43:48.543 --> 43:51.044
I shouldn't haνe said it to anybody,
not in that environment.

43:51.129 --> 43:53.297
Sweetheart, look at me.

43:53.381 --> 43:56.091
You, too, Hunt. Can I call you Hunt?

43:56.175 --> 43:58.468
There's the guy under the lights,
and there's me.

43:58.553 --> 44:02.264
He's made me rich,
but he hasn't made me very nice.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.891
I hope we can put it behind us.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.145
I know that's what you do.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.647
I guess I just don't have the stomach for it.

44:16.279 --> 44:18.905
Well, I'm famished.

44:26.706 --> 44:27.706
Excuse me.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.071
Bets, you all right?

45:00.865 --> 45:01.865
Yes.

45:04.619 --> 45:06.244
What's wrong?

45:06.329 --> 45:08.121
Nothing.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.749
Nothing's wrong.

45:12.919 --> 45:15.128
I'm just so happy.

45:21.052 --> 45:25.430
When I said I wanted to be
a part of your life...

45:27.350 --> 45:29.059
this is what I meant.

45:35.274 --> 45:37.526
We make a great team.

46:00.258 --> 46:03.260
