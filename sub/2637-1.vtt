00:01.217 --> 00:05.210
If a photon is directed through a plane
with two slits in it and either is observed...

00:05.388 --> 00:07.913
...it will not go through both.
If unobserved, it will.

00:08.090 --> 00:11.322
If it's observed after it left the plane,
before it hits its target...

00:11.494 --> 00:14.327
-... it will not have gone through both slits.
- Agreed.

00:14.497 --> 00:15.623
What's your point?

00:15.799 --> 00:18.768
There's no point,
I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

00:24.307 --> 00:26.935
- Excuse me.
- Hang on.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.340
One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov.

00:33.516 --> 00:36.007
Twenty-six across is MCM.

00:36.186 --> 00:37.244
Fourteen down is-

00:37.420 --> 00:39.251
Move your finger.

00:39.422 --> 00:42.255
- phylum, which makes 14 across
Port-au-Prince.

00:43.693 --> 00:47.686
See, Papa Doc's capital idea,
that's Port-au-Prince.

00:48.398 --> 00:49.956
Haiti.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.266
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

00:54.604 --> 00:59.268
Um, is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

01:00.176 --> 01:03.111
If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.275
I think this is the place.

01:07.117 --> 01:08.448
- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

01:08.618 --> 01:10.779
- We'll be right back.
- Oh, take your time.

01:10.954 --> 01:13.616
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

01:14.224 --> 01:16.454
Oh, wait.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.669 --> 01:28.796
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

01:28.972 --> 01:31.600
What, are you kidding? you're a semipro.

01:32.242 --> 01:34.540
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

01:34.711 --> 01:37.908
There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IQ offspring.

01:38.081 --> 01:39.105
Think about that.

01:39.282 --> 01:43.582
I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

01:44.220 --> 01:45.881
Sheldon, this was your idea.

01:46.055 --> 01:49.252
A little extra money to get
fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment?

01:49.425 --> 01:52.758
I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.

01:53.329 --> 01:56.298
There's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

01:56.466 --> 01:59.458
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...

01:59.636 --> 02:03.128
...a differential to solve for the area
under a curve?

02:03.706 --> 02:06.869
- I'm sure she'll still love him.
- I wouldn't.

02:08.443 --> 02:10.071
Well, what do you wanna do?

02:10.246 --> 02:12.680
- I want to leave.
- Okay.

02:12.849 --> 02:15.044
- What's the protocol for leaving?
- I don't know.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.346
I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

02:19.289 --> 02:20.722
Let's try just walking out.

02:21.591 --> 02:22.785
Okay.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.926
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

02:34.103 --> 02:35.536
Nice meeting you.

02:38.074 --> 02:41.510
- Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
- No.

02:42.312 --> 02:45.440
You wanna hear an interesting thing
about stairs?

02:45.615 --> 02:47.014
Not really.

02:47.183 --> 02:50.175
If the height of a step is off
by as little as two millimeters...

02:50.353 --> 02:53.516
-... most people will trip.
- I don't care.

02:54.357 --> 02:56.188
Two millime-? That doesn't seem right.

02:56.359 --> 02:58.884
It's true.
I did a series of experiments when I was 12.

02:59.062 --> 03:00.791
My father broke his clavicle.

03:01.798 --> 03:03.857
Is that why they sent you
to boarding school?

03:04.033 --> 03:06.729
No. That was the result
of my work with lasers.

03:12.876 --> 03:13.934
New neighbor?

03:14.110 --> 03:15.338
Evidently.

03:15.511 --> 03:18.674
Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

03:19.048 --> 03:22.643
Two-hundred pound transvestite
with a skin condition? Yes, she is.

03:24.587 --> 03:25.747
Oh, hi.

03:25.922 --> 03:26.946
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.647
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:29.692 --> 03:31.284
Hi?

03:31.461 --> 03:34.123
We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.696
Oh, that's nice.

03:36.733 --> 03:39.201
No. We don't live together. I mean...

03:39.369 --> 03:44.534
...we live together, but in separate,
heterosexual bedrooms.

03:45.108 --> 03:47.201
Okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor.

03:47.377 --> 03:49.504
- Penny.
- Leonard. Sheldon.

03:49.679 --> 03:51.306
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.210
Hi.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.175
Well...

03:56.552 --> 03:58.042
Oh, welcome to the building.

03:58.221 --> 04:00.553
Oh, thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

04:00.723 --> 04:01.781
- Oh, great.
- Great.

04:01.958 --> 04:03.653
- Great.
- Great.

04:05.461 --> 04:06.826
Well, bye.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.964
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:11.601 --> 04:13.330
Should we have invited her for lunch?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.529
No. We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

04:17.206 --> 04:19.333
We already watched
the season two DVDs.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.136
Not with commentary.

04:23.212 --> 04:24.907
I think we should be good neighbors.

04:25.081 --> 04:26.912
Invite her over, make her feel welcome.

04:27.550 --> 04:30.747
We never invited Louie/Louise over.

04:31.287 --> 04:33.221
Well, and that was wrong of us.

04:33.389 --> 04:34.720
We need to widen our circle.

04:34.891 --> 04:37.917
I have a very wide circle.

04:38.094 --> 04:41.188
I have 212 friends on MySpace.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.556
yes, and you've never met one of them.

04:44.968 --> 04:46.526
That's the beauty of it.

04:48.838 --> 04:50.772
I'm gonna invite her over.

04:50.940 --> 04:53.670
We'll have a nice meal and chat.

04:53.843 --> 04:57.210
Chat? We don't chat,
at least not off-line.

04:58.781 --> 04:59.941
Well, it's not difficult.

05:00.116 --> 05:01.743
You just listen to what she says...

05:01.918 --> 05:05.547
...and then you say something appropriate
in response.

05:06.456 --> 05:08.014
To what end?

05:09.058 --> 05:11.219
- Hi. Again.
- Hi.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.692
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:13.863 --> 05:15.387
Anyway...

05:15.565 --> 05:18.625
...we brought home Indian food...

05:19.535 --> 05:21.594
...and I know that
moving can be stressful...

05:21.771 --> 05:23.966
...and I find
that when I'm undergoing stress...

05:24.140 --> 05:27.439
...that good food
and company can have a comforting effect.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.446
Also, curry's a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that, you know...

05:32.615 --> 05:36.984
...a clean colon is just one less thing
to worry about.

05:38.321 --> 05:41.017
I'm no expert,
but in the context of a lunch invitation...

05:41.190 --> 05:43.818
...you might wanna skip the reference
to bowel movements.

05:44.327 --> 05:46.158
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?

05:47.230 --> 05:48.254
yes.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.490
Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.

05:50.666 --> 05:51.690
Great.

05:51.868 --> 05:54.166
So, what do you guys do for fun
around here?

05:54.804 --> 05:56.795
Well, today we tried masturbating
for money.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.734
- Okay, well, make yourself at home.
- Okay.

06:26.903 --> 06:30.339
- Thank you.
- you're very welcome.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.174
You're very welcome.

06:33.676 --> 06:36.474
This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard, did you do this?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.046
Actually, that's my work.

06:39.615 --> 06:40.604
Wow.

06:40.783 --> 06:43.183
Yeah, well, it's just some
quantum mechanics...

06:43.352 --> 06:47.186
...with a little string theory doodling
around the edges. That part's just a joke.

06:47.356 --> 06:50.587
It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.986
So you're, like, one of those
Beautiful Mind genius guys.

06:56.065 --> 06:57.589
yeah.

06:58.601 --> 06:59.829
This is really impressive.

07:00.002 --> 07:03.267
I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.371
Holy smokes.

07:05.541 --> 07:08.840
If by "holy smokes," you mean
a derivative restatement of the stuff...

07:09.011 --> 07:12.378
...you can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at MIT, sure.

07:12.982 --> 07:14.381
- What?
- Oh, come on.

07:14.550 --> 07:18.179
Who hasn't seen this differential below
"here I sit brokenhearted"?

07:18.354 --> 07:22.381
At least I didn't have to invent 26
dimensions just to make the math come out.

07:22.558 --> 07:25.322
- I didn't invent them. They're there.
- In what universe?

07:25.495 --> 07:27.292
In all of them, that is the point.

07:28.397 --> 07:30.126
Do you guys mind if I start?

07:30.299 --> 07:31.926
- Penny.
- yeah?

07:32.101 --> 07:34.228
That's where I sit.

07:35.138 --> 07:36.901
So sit next to me.

07:38.341 --> 07:42.368
- No, I sit there.
- What's the difference?

07:42.545 --> 07:45.105
- What's the difference?
- Here we go.

07:45.281 --> 07:48.512
In winter, that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...

07:48.684 --> 07:50.879
...yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.

07:51.053 --> 07:55.251
In the summer, it's in a cross breeze created
by opening windows there and there.

07:55.424 --> 07:59.520
It faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct, discouraging conversation...

07:59.695 --> 08:02.163
...nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

08:02.331 --> 08:06.392
I could go on,
but I think I've made my point.

08:08.704 --> 08:10.035
Do you want me to move?

08:10.206 --> 08:12.037
- Well...
- Just sit somewhere else.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.900
Fine.

08:33.629 --> 08:35.756
Sheldon, sit.

08:36.966 --> 08:38.331
Ah.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.467
- Well, this is nice.
- We don't have a lot of company over.

08:43.639 --> 08:46.199
That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.364
yes, I know.

08:47.543 --> 08:49.943
Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle
until 1 in the morning.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.637
- Yeah, I remember.
- I resent you saying we don't have company.

08:52.815 --> 08:55.579
- That has a negative social implication.
- I said I'm sorry.

08:56.886 --> 08:58.046
So...

08:58.221 --> 08:59.586
...Klingon Boggle?

08:59.755 --> 09:04.317
yeah. It's like regular Boggle,
but in Klingon.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.663
That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.

09:10.566 --> 09:12.124
Me? Okay.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.896
I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

09:16.072 --> 09:19.508
Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

09:19.675 --> 09:22.735
...that the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

09:22.912 --> 09:26.177
...at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.

09:28.517 --> 09:30.144
Participate in the what?

09:30.319 --> 09:32.150
I think what Sheldon's trying to say...

09:32.321 --> 09:35.051
...is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

09:35.224 --> 09:37.920
Oh, yeah, a lot of people
think I'm a water sign.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.424
Okay, let's see, what else?

09:40.596 --> 09:41.620
Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

09:41.797 --> 09:45.858
No, except for fish,
and the occasional steak. I love steak.

09:47.436 --> 09:48.903
Well, that's interesting.

09:49.071 --> 09:50.663
Leonard can't process corn.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.103
So do you have some sort of a job?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.304
Oh, yeah.

09:58.481 --> 10:00.472
I'm a waitress
at The Cheesecake Factory.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.445
I love cheesecake.

10:02.618 --> 10:05.985
- you're lactose intolerant.
- I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.

10:07.556 --> 10:09.387
Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.

10:09.558 --> 10:12.994
It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to L. A. from Lincoln, Nebraska...

10:13.162 --> 10:17.360
...to be an actress and winds up
a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.

10:17.967 --> 10:19.662
So it's based on your life.

10:19.835 --> 10:21.826
No, I'm from Omaha.

10:25.408 --> 10:27.399
If that was a movie, I would go see it.

10:27.576 --> 10:28.770
I know, right?

10:28.944 --> 10:30.673
Okay, let's see, what else?

10:32.148 --> 10:33.843
I guess that's about it.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.647
That's the story of Penny.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.811
Well, it sounds wonderful.

10:39.922 --> 10:41.355
It was.

10:41.524 --> 10:45.016
Until I fell in love with a jerk.

10:48.164 --> 10:49.529
What is happening?

10:49.699 --> 10:51.690
I don't know.

10:51.867 --> 10:54.097
Oh, God, you know,
four years I lived with him.

10:54.270 --> 10:57.433
Four years.
That's like as long as high school.

10:57.606 --> 11:00.097
It took you four years
to get through high school?

11:02.044 --> 11:05.844
I just- I can't believe I trusted him.

11:09.819 --> 11:12.344
Should I say something?
I feel I should say something.

11:12.521 --> 11:14.148
you? No, you'll only make it worse.

11:14.323 --> 11:16.518
you wanna know the most pathetic part?

11:16.692 --> 11:20.219
Even though I hate his lying,
cheating guts...

11:20.396 --> 11:22.830
...I still love him.

11:22.998 --> 11:24.056
Is that crazy?

11:24.233 --> 11:25.894
yes.

11:27.303 --> 11:30.602
No, it's not crazy. It's a-

11:30.773 --> 11:32.468
It's a paradox.

11:32.641 --> 11:36.008
Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.

11:36.178 --> 11:40.774
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave,
as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.282
But then, along comes Albert Einstein...

11:43.452 --> 11:46.421
...and discovers that light
behaves like particles too.

11:49.058 --> 11:51.583
Well, I didn't make it worse.

11:52.895 --> 11:54.556
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.

11:54.730 --> 11:57.426
And on top of everything else,
I'm all gross from moving...

11:57.600 --> 11:59.329
...and my stupid shower doesn't work.

11:59.502 --> 12:01.663
Our shower works.

12:02.271 --> 12:04.501
Really? Would it be totally weird
if I used it?

12:04.673 --> 12:05.697
- yes.
- No.

12:05.875 --> 12:06.899
- No?
- No.

12:07.076 --> 12:08.304
No.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.110
It's right down the hall.

12:10.279 --> 12:11.473
Okay, thanks.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.239
you guys are really sweet.

12:19.722 --> 12:22.589
Well, this is an interesting development.

12:25.294 --> 12:26.318
How so?

12:26.495 --> 12:27.826
It has been some time...

12:27.997 --> 12:30.864
...since we've had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment.

12:31.033 --> 12:33.024
That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving...

12:33.202 --> 12:36.262
...my grandmother with Alzheimer's
had that episode?

12:37.473 --> 12:41.273
Point taken. It has been some time since
we've had a woman take her clothes off...

12:41.444 --> 12:44.106
...after which
we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.506
The worst part
was watching her carve that turkey.

12:48.951 --> 12:52.717
So, what exactly
are you trying to accomplish here?

12:52.888 --> 12:54.014
Excuse me?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.784
That woman in there
is not going to have sex with you.

12:56.959 --> 12:58.950
Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.

12:59.128 --> 13:01.824
Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.

13:01.997 --> 13:04.329
What makes you think
she wouldn't have sex with me?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.468
I'm a male and she's a female.

13:06.969 --> 13:10.063
yes, but not of the same species.

13:10.239 --> 13:12.332
I'm not gonna engage
in hypotheticals here.

13:12.508 --> 13:16.205
- I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
- Oh, of course.

13:16.378 --> 13:19.438
That's not to say that
if a carnal relationship were to develop...

13:19.615 --> 13:22.106
...that I wouldn't participate.

13:23.419 --> 13:24.886
However briefly.

13:26.121 --> 13:28.385
Do you think this possibility
will be hindered...

13:28.557 --> 13:32.425
...when she discovers your Luke Skywalker
"no more tears" shampoo?

13:33.162 --> 13:35.630
It's Darth Vader shampoo.

13:37.032 --> 13:39.398
Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.

13:41.303 --> 13:43.828
- Wait till you see this.
- It's fantastic. Unbelievable.

13:44.006 --> 13:45.098
See what?

13:46.308 --> 13:50.540
It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT
in 1974.

13:50.713 --> 13:51.907
This isn't a good time.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.208
It's before he became...

13:54.383 --> 13:56.214
...a creepy computer voice.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.085
- That's great, you guys have to go.
- Why?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.248
- It's just not a good time.
- Leonard has a lady over.

14:03.792 --> 14:06.693
yeah, right.
your grandmother back in town?

14:08.497 --> 14:09.521
No.

14:09.698 --> 14:12.189
And she's not a lady,
she's just a new neighbor.

14:12.368 --> 14:15.098
Hang on, there really is a lady here?

14:15.271 --> 14:16.738
- Uh-huh.
- And you want us out...

14:16.906 --> 14:18.931
...because you're anticipating coitus?

14:19.508 --> 14:22.306
- I'm not anticipating coitus.
- So she's available for coitus?

14:22.478 --> 14:24.946
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

14:25.114 --> 14:27.742
Technically,
that would be coitus interruptus.

14:28.551 --> 14:31.577
Hey, is there a trick
to getting it to switch from tub to shower?

14:31.754 --> 14:33.551
Oh, hi, sorry.

14:33.722 --> 14:35.053
Hello.

14:36.392 --> 14:38.622
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

14:40.329 --> 14:43.423
Howard Wolowitz,
CalTech Department of Applied Physics.

14:43.599 --> 14:45.464
You may be familiar
with some of my work.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.102
It's currently orbiting
Jupiter's largest moon...

14:48.270 --> 14:51.103
...taking high-resolution
digital photographs.

14:51.907 --> 14:54.808
Penny. I work at
The Cheesecake Factory.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.002
- I'll show you the trick with the shower.
- Okay.

14:58.948 --> 15:00.415
I'm sorry?

15:00.583 --> 15:02.210
It's French for "good shower. "

15:02.384 --> 15:05.148
It's a sentiment I can express
in six languages.

15:05.921 --> 15:08.515
Save it for your blog, Howard.

15:15.931 --> 15:18.161
All right, there it goes.
It sticks, I'm sorry.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.995
- Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.194
Oh, you're just gonna step right-? Okay.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.633
PENNy: Hey, Leonard?
- The hair products are Sheldon's.

15:25.808 --> 15:26.968
Okay.

15:27.142 --> 15:31.044
- Um, can I ask you a favor?
- A favor?

15:31.213 --> 15:34.444
Sure, you could ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.

15:35.217 --> 15:39.313
- It's okay if you say no.
- Oh, I'll probably say yes.

15:39.588 --> 15:43.649
It's just not the kind of thing
you ask a guy you just met.

15:43.826 --> 15:45.453
Wow.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.866
I really think we should examine
the chain of causality here.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.264
- Must we?
- Event A:

15:55.437 --> 15:57.496
A beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.

15:57.673 --> 16:01.006
Event B: We drive halfway across town
to retrieve a television set...

16:01.176 --> 16:03.371
...from the aforementioned woman's
ex-boyfriend.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.140
Query: On what plane of existence
is there even a semi-rational link...

16:07.316 --> 16:09.341
...between these events?

16:10.052 --> 16:12.384
She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.022
Well, that may be the proximal cause
of our journey...

16:15.190 --> 16:17.624
...but we both know it exists
in contradistinction...

16:17.793 --> 16:19.727
...to the higher-level distal cause.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.728
- Which is?
- you think with your penis.

16:23.265 --> 16:26.393
That's a biological impossibility,
and you didn't have to come.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.765
Oh, yes. I could have stayed behind
to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny...

16:29.938 --> 16:32.270
...in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.

16:32.441 --> 16:34.341
And why can't she get her own TV?

16:34.510 --> 16:36.444
Come on, you know how it is
with breakups.

16:36.612 --> 16:38.910
No, I don't, and neither do you.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.140
But I- I broke up with Joyce Kim.

16:41.316 --> 16:44.774
You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.

16:44.953 --> 16:47.513
To mend her broken heart.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.650
This situation is much less complicated.

16:52.828 --> 16:55.490
There's some dispute
between Penny and her ex-boyfriend...

16:55.664 --> 16:57.325
...as to who gets custody of the TV.

16:57.499 --> 17:01.230
- She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
- So we get to have a scene with him?

17:01.403 --> 17:03.894
No, Sheldon,
there's not going to be a scene.

17:04.073 --> 17:05.733
There's two of us and one of him.

17:05.907 --> 17:08.934
Leonard, the two of us
can't even carry a TV.

17:10.746 --> 17:13.681
So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon
at the university?

17:19.354 --> 17:21.788
I'm sorry, do you speak English?

17:21.957 --> 17:25.017
Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.

17:25.761 --> 17:27.160
Really? Why?

17:27.329 --> 17:29.092
He's kind of a nerd.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.391
Juice box?

17:38.040 --> 17:40.474
- I'll do the talking.
Yeah?

17:40.642 --> 17:43.236
- Hi. I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
- Hello.

17:43.412 --> 17:44.845
What did I just-?

17:46.715 --> 17:49.548
- We're here to pick up Penny's TV.
- Get lost.

17:49.718 --> 17:51.083
Okay, thanks for your time.

17:51.253 --> 17:54.745
- We're not gonna give up just like that.
- Leonard, the TV's in the building.

17:54.923 --> 17:57.915
We've been denied access to the building,
ergo we are done.

17:58.093 --> 18:01.961
Excuse me. If I were to give up at the first
hitch, I never would have identified...

18:02.131 --> 18:06.067
...the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the big bang.

18:06.802 --> 18:09.032
My apologies. What's your plan?

18:23.085 --> 18:25.747
It's just a privilege
to watch your mind at work.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.323
Come on,
we have a combined IQ of 360.

18:29.491 --> 18:32.551
We should be able to figure out
how to get into a stupid building.

18:36.932 --> 18:40.026
- What do you think their combined IQ is?
- Just grab the door.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.902
This is it.

18:44.606 --> 18:45.766
I'll do the talking.

18:45.941 --> 18:48.637
Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.981
- yeah?
- I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

18:59.154 --> 19:00.951
From the intercom.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.725
How the hell did you get in the building?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.294
We're scientists.

19:09.131 --> 19:11.429
Tell him about our IQ.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.073
- Leonard.
- What?

19:25.247 --> 19:28.444
- My mom bought me those pants.
- I'm sorry.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.143
you're gonna have to call her.

19:33.655 --> 19:36.556
Sheldon, I am so sorry
I dragged you through this.

19:36.725 --> 19:40.957
It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing
and it won't be my last.

19:41.129 --> 19:42.790
And you were right about my motives.

19:42.965 --> 19:45.729
I was hoping to establish
a relationship with Penny...

19:45.901 --> 19:49.132
...that might have someday led to sex.

19:49.738 --> 19:52.229
Well, you got me out of my pants.

19:53.642 --> 19:57.134
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.

19:57.312 --> 19:58.506
I've got my work.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.615
One day I'll win the Nobel Prize
and then I'll die alone.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.843
Don't think like that.
you're not going to die alone.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.989
Thank you, Sheldon.
you're a good friend.

20:09.124 --> 20:12.025
And you're certainly
not gonna win a Nobel Prize.

20:12.561 --> 20:16.361
This is one of my favorite places
to kick back after a quest.

20:16.531 --> 20:18.328
They have a great house ale.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.524
PENNy:
Wow, cool tiger.

20:19.701 --> 20:22.636
yeah, I've had him since Level 10.

20:22.905 --> 20:24.805
His name is Buttons.

20:25.374 --> 20:27.433
Anyway, if you had
your own game character...

20:27.609 --> 20:30.510
...we could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.

20:30.679 --> 20:33.978
- That sounds interesting.
- So you'll think about it?

20:34.149 --> 20:36.879
Oh, I don't think
I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

20:38.854 --> 20:40.583
Smooth.

20:42.524 --> 20:45.425
- We're home.
- Oh, my God. What happened?

20:45.594 --> 20:51.226
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards
and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.526
I'm so sorry.

20:52.701 --> 20:56.159
I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.930
No, it was a valid hypothesis.

20:58.106 --> 21:01.337
That was a valid hypo-?
What is happening to you?

21:01.877 --> 21:04.971
Really, thank you so much
for going and trying.

21:05.147 --> 21:08.674
you just- you're so terrific.

21:10.352 --> 21:14.049
Why don't you put some clothes on,
I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?

21:14.222 --> 21:15.416
- Really? Great.
- Thank you.

21:15.590 --> 21:16.818
Okay.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.330
you're not done with her, are you?

21:25.334 --> 21:28.428
Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

21:30.305 --> 21:32.739
Not to mention imaginary.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.580
- Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
- Sure.

21:40.749 --> 21:42.740
We can't have Thai,
we had Indian for lunch.

21:42.918 --> 21:45.352
- So?
- They're both curry-based cuisines.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.216
- So?
- It would be gastronomically redundant.

21:48.390 --> 21:51.826
I can see we're going to have to
spell out everything for this girl.

21:52.594 --> 21:54.653
Any ideas, Raj?

21:56.264 --> 21:58.528
Turn left on Lake Street
and head up to Colorado.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.328
I know a wonderful little sushi bar
that has karaoke.

22:01.503 --> 22:03.471
Oh, that sounds like fun.

22:15.984 --> 22:18.316
I don't know your odds
in the world as a whole...

22:18.487 --> 22:22.753
...but as far as the population of this car
goes, you're a veritable mac daddy.
