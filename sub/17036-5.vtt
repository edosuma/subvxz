MEG: Is my phone covered
on your insurance?

00:36.633 --> 00:37.433
No.

00:37.533 --> 00:38.733
Why would it be?

00:38.833 --> 00:39.667
Are you drunk?

00:39.767 --> 00:41.600
You look drunk.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.700
No

00:42.800 --> 00:44.433
JENNY: We've got
some family news.

00:44.533 --> 00:45.500
Are you with Bunny?

00:45.600 --> 00:47.633
[sighs] No, I don't
know where Bunny is.

00:47.733 --> 00:49.533
[moaning]

00:52.433 --> 00:53.400
OK.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.667
We're gonna have to
try something else.

00:54.767 --> 00:56.700
So, I've got some news, Meg.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.667
OK.

00:57.767 --> 00:59.167
Sara's pregnant.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.767
Oh, dude, I'm sorry.

01:00.867 --> 01:01.967
How far along is she?

01:02.067 --> 01:03.933
Wasn't a mistake, Meg.

01:04.033 --> 01:05.933
We're very happy about it.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.433
Oh, shit, right.

01:07.533 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, so what you
think then, Meg?

01:09.100 --> 01:10.200
You'll be an auntie.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.500
You'll be Auntie Meg.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.433
Yeah.

01:12.533 --> 01:13.433
Oh shit!

01:13.533 --> 01:16.400
Bollocks!
- Are you pleased?

01:16.500 --> 01:17.933
No!

01:18.033 --> 01:20.833

01:20.933 --> 01:22.633

Ow.

Ouch.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.033
[grunting]

01:41.133 --> 01:45.400
Well, this is just,
frankly just baffling.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.767
I've never had to
do this before,

01:46.867 --> 01:49.000
but I'm gonna have to ask
that we stop having sex.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.733
Um, that's OK.

01:51.833 --> 01:52.833
I'll tell you what--

01:52.933 --> 01:55.533
I'm in town for a
couple of weeks.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.367
Why don't we swap numbers?

02:00.633 --> 02:01.733
Here you go.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.933
Give me a call when you're
feeling better, Bunny.

02:04.033 --> 02:07.167
BUNNY: Oh, will do, handsome.

02:21.833 --> 02:22.900
MEG: Who was that?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.533
Just some incredibly
hot guy that I

02:24.633 --> 02:27.600
couldn't have sex with
because it was too painful.

02:27.700 --> 02:28.667
Emotionally?

02:28.767 --> 02:30.233
Physically.

02:30.333 --> 02:32.433
Probably down to the fact that
I haven't had of shit in a week.

02:32.533 --> 02:33.400
MEG: Prunes?

02:33.500 --> 02:34.667
All-Bran?

02:34.767 --> 02:36.067
A doctor?

02:36.167 --> 02:38.000
But I'll see needy people,
and they make me sad.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.600
MEG: Bunny, something
terrible happened.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.600
You've broken your
laptop and your phone.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.767
MEG: Yeah.

02:42.867 --> 02:44.033
But something even
more devastating.

02:44.133 --> 02:45.967
Sara's pregnant.

02:46.067 --> 02:46.900
Is she keeping it?

02:47.000 --> 02:47.900
That's what I said.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.800
Yes.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.167
Auntie Meg.

02:50.267 --> 02:52.000
Now, there's a boner
killer if ever I heard one.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.267
MEG: I know.

02:53.367 --> 02:56.033
My little brother is
married and procreating,

02:56.133 --> 02:57.933
and all I have to show
for myself is a mostly

02:58.033 --> 03:00.967
fictitious CV and a
sponsored dolphin who,

03:01.067 --> 03:02.600
frankly, I don't think exists.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.733
But your troll
collection is incomparable.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.200
Cheers, mate.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.467
Have you seen Laura?

BUNNY: No.

03:09.467 --> 03:11.767

03:11.867 --> 03:13.367
I'll call her.

them just stopped

03:28.667 --> 03:30.033
working on the same day.

03:30.133 --> 03:32.167
Let's start with the laptop.

03:32.267 --> 03:35.300
Did you spill something in this?

03:35.400 --> 03:36.133
Doubt it.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.367
MAN: Someone definitely did.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.833
Oh, well, um, I did
lend it to a friend.

03:41.933 --> 03:46.433
Does your friend
like drinking red wine?

03:46.533 --> 03:47.700
What?

03:47.800 --> 03:51.567
She is an absolutely
cunny, mate.

03:51.667 --> 03:52.667
Right.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.733
Let's take a look at the phone.

03:56.933 --> 03:57.733
Oh.

04:00.533 --> 04:04.033
I think we both know
that that's piss.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.867
Well, it could be anything.
- It's--

04:05.967 --> 04:07.200
Yeah, yeah, no, that's piss.

04:07.300 --> 04:07.967
Yeah.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.400
Lazy bowels?

04:09.500 --> 04:12.033
Take these laxatives, and
when you have a movement,

04:12.133 --> 04:14.033
you'll need to
retain a stool sample

04:14.133 --> 04:16.400
and bring back that back.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.967
So you want me to put
my turd in this pod,

04:19.067 --> 04:20.200
And then give it back to you?

04:20.300 --> 04:20.967
Yes.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.333
Oh, how awful.

04:22.433 --> 04:25.833
And you'll need to avoid
everything on this list.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.567
Sugar, caffeine, alcohol--

04:29.667 --> 04:31.800
But it's a list of
everything that's nice.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.067
Yes.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.400
Just avoid eating or
drinking anything nice.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.333
That.

04:36.433 --> 04:37.933
Should do it.

04:38.033 --> 04:39.500

asleep on the night bus again.

05:03.967 --> 05:05.867
Saw Gary on Instagram
with some slag--

05:05.967 --> 05:07.100
went on a rampage.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.900
- Who were you even out with?
- Me mum.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.200
She's still going.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.500
Just got a text from
her calling me boring.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.533
Am I boring?

05:13.633 --> 05:14.833
Just don't feel like
drinking anymore.

05:14.933 --> 05:16.533
I'm gonna detox for it.

05:19.767 --> 05:20.633
Seriously?

05:20.733 --> 05:21.767
Yeah.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.367
Oh, yea, well this
is just perfect,

05:23.467 --> 05:25.200
because I'm off the sauce, too.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.733
Let's all detox together.

05:26.833 --> 05:30.033
We can go to a hot yoga, can
meditate, we can make recipes

05:30.133 --> 05:31.000
from Gwyneth Paltrow's blog.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.567
That sounds shite.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.933
But yeah, I will save money and
look amazing in skinny jeans.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.633
I will not let Gary
win this break up.

05:36.733 --> 05:38.833
MEG: Yeah, and if I'm
not constantly drunk,

05:38.933 --> 05:40.767
then I'll stop
breaking all my things.

05:40.867 --> 05:43.567
It's time to binge
on being sober.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.700
Sober binge.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.667
Mhm.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.833
BUNNY: Stretch.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.233
Stretch, Meg.

05:58.333 --> 05:59.433
And lengthen.
[fart noise]

05:59.533 --> 06:00.167

06:04.500 --> 06:06.367
We're signed up.

Wahey!

06:07.467 --> 06:10.333
[music playing]

06:18.633 --> 06:22.000
Well, got through
one whole day of detox,

06:22.100 --> 06:23.467
and we've signed up
to the mud marathon

06:23.567 --> 06:25.067
with the intention
of actually doing it.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.067
It's "mara-thun."

06:26.167 --> 06:27.500
MEG: We're smashing it, guys.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.700
So what should we do to distract
ourselves tonight, team?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.100
Ooh, I know.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.800
We can make healthy
soups for the week

06:32.900 --> 06:33.767
and freeze it in batches.

06:33.867 --> 06:34.800
I'm off out.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.033
BUNNY: Yeah, me too.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.033
Got a hot sex date
with corner shop guy.

06:38.133 --> 06:39.500
You better then?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.667
No, I'm still bunged up,
but I got some painkillers,

06:41.767 --> 06:43.500
so I'm gonna power through.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.433
Not a phrase to be used
in relation to sex, surely.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.833
Look, I just need
some Penny P, mate.

06:48.933 --> 06:52.533
You know when you just need the
pen, and nothing else will do?

06:52.633 --> 06:53.733
Yeah.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.100
BUNNY: It's too fucking
painful because my bowels

06:55.200 --> 06:56.600
are backed up.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.000
Ahh, I mean that is some
extraordinary detail, isn't it?

06:59.100 --> 07:00.200
Even for family.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.300
I guess he'll just
have to eat me out

07:01.400 --> 07:02.433
if the worst comes to the worst.

07:02.533 --> 07:04.100
If the worst comes
the worst, yeah.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.333
What about you, Laura?

07:05.433 --> 07:06.667
LAURA: Turns out
when I were lashed,

07:06.767 --> 07:08.167
I went on a Tinder rampage.

07:08.267 --> 07:10.933
Now I've got a fistful of
killer offers from fit blokes.

07:11.033 --> 07:12.633
Feel like it will take
my mind off not boozing.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.833
So you're going on
a sober Tinder date.

07:14.933 --> 07:15.933
Yikes.

07:16.033 --> 07:17.100
I'm going to pick
a really healthy

07:17.200 --> 07:18.267
looking one who
probably doesn't drink.

07:18.367 --> 07:19.567
BUNNY: What are
you gonna do, Meg?

07:19.667 --> 07:21.433
Not sure.

07:21.533 --> 07:24.367
I'll think of
something cool to do.

07:24.467 --> 07:29.167
JENNY: It's lovely to have you
with us on a Saturday night.

07:29.267 --> 07:30.600
Oh, no thank you.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.000
I'm not drinking.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.633
You're not pregnant,
are you, Meg?

07:33.733 --> 07:35.267
No just you.
SARA: Hmph.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.433
Thank God.

07:36.533 --> 07:38.400
Not sure the world's
quite ready for that yet.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.000
FRANK: So why are
you really here, Meg?

07:40.100 --> 07:41.267
What was canceled?

07:41.367 --> 07:43.700
Oh, you didn't get
stood up did you, love?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.767
Internet dating-- it's
very harsh, isn't it?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.233
They come in, take
one look at you,

07:48.333 --> 07:51.267
and leave if you're not
conventionally attractive.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.067
Nobody stood me up, thank you.

07:53.167 --> 07:56.267
Nothing was canceled
except my invitation

07:56.367 --> 07:58.400
to this family dinner, clearly.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
No, Meg, we just
didn't want to rub it in.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.800
Rub what in?

08:01.900 --> 08:03.433
The news.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.267
What would you be
rubbing in, exactly?

08:05.367 --> 08:07.133
Because I'm doing fine.

08:07.233 --> 08:09.500
SARA: We just didn't want you
to feel, um, not inferior--

08:09.600 --> 08:10.667
- Inadequate.
- No.

08:10.767 --> 08:11.567
JAMES: Lonely.

08:11.667 --> 08:12.700
SARA: No.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.000
JENNY: Oh, uh, aimless.
- Yes, that's the one.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.267
That's it!
Yes.

08:15.367 --> 08:16.633
That's it.

08:16.733 --> 08:19.767
Would an aimless person be
doing a marathon in two weeks?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.533
It's "mara-thun."

08:21.633 --> 08:22.867
You're doing a marathon?

08:22.967 --> 08:24.333
MEG: Well, it's not
actually a marathon,

08:24.433 --> 08:27.833
but it's like a marathon,
except it's actually harder.

08:27.933 --> 08:31.333
[laughing]

08:34.400 --> 08:35.933
BUNNY: Ow.

08:36.033 --> 08:37.267
Ouch.
Ah.

08:37.367 --> 08:38.533
MAN: Are you OK?
- Yup.

08:38.633 --> 08:39.733
Do you want me to stop?

08:39.833 --> 08:41.433
No.
Keep going.

08:41.533 --> 08:42.433
OK.

08:42.533 --> 08:43.400
[moaning]

08:43.500 --> 08:44.400
Oh, just, just--

08:44.500 --> 08:46.267
I'm really not
comfortable with this.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.767
It just doesn't sound
very consensual.

08:47.867 --> 08:49.033
No, no, no, it's fine.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.133
I'm just, um, really
sensitive down there.

08:51.233 --> 08:54.333
Maybe it's because I'm so
small, and you're so big.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.300
Well, what if I just
kept to the outside area?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.300

garden, as it were?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.567
Oh, by all means, you
can play in the garden

09:01.667 --> 09:02.600
as much as you like.

09:06.567 --> 09:07.633
OK.

09:07.733 --> 09:09.033
Oh.

09:09.133 --> 09:13.100
Oh my, oh my--

09:13.200 --> 09:14.900

09:15.000 --> 09:16.300
Woo.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.167

It's just great to meet

09:18.267 --> 09:19.500
a fellow fitness fanatic.

realize is that alcohol

is just empty calories anyways.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.633
I'll tell you what is funny.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.667
I could hardly lift
a 20-pound dumbbell,

09:28.767 --> 09:31.367
so I had to work on my strength
without hitting the weights.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.733
But now I can bench three
by ten sets of 110 pounds.

09:34.833 --> 09:35.700
That is funny.

believe me, obviously.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.067
They said we were
lazy millennials who

12:17.167 --> 12:18.333
couldn't commit to anything.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.733
They're right, of course.

Yes, but wouldn't it be
nice to prove them wrong?

And we could do
it for charity.

about it afterwards.
