<i>AND THE HAVE NOTS"...</i>

41:29.796 --> 41:30.964
SHE DID IT.

41:30.964 --> 41:31.998
SHUT UP, KATHERYN.

41:31.998 --> 41:34.100
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
SHOOT ME, TOO?

41:34.100 --> 41:35.602
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE YOU STAY?

41:37.604 --> 41:39.673
OH. [ SCOFFS ]
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

41:39.673 --> 41:41.642
BEFORE I SHOWER,
BEFORE I DO ANYTHING,

41:41.642 --> 41:43.376
I'M GONNA GO
IN THAT BITCH HOUSE

41:43.376 --> 41:44.545
AND I'M GONNA
CUT HER THROAT OUT.

41:44.545 --> 41:48.214
I TRIED SO HARD
TO TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD,

41:48.214 --> 41:51.017
AND I GET DRAGGED BACK DOWN
EVERY TIME.

41:51.017 --> 41:52.218
CANDACE.

41:53.286 --> 41:55.055
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

41:55.055 --> 41:57.624
DID YOU DO SOMETHING
TO QUINCY?
