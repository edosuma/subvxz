03:28.960 --> 03:30.800
Good work with the report
last week, mate.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.600
Edison's transfer account?

03:35.680 --> 03:36.680
Sorry.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.360
Wake up, pretty boy.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.000
I'm trying to pay you
a fucking compliment, mate. Huh?

03:43.720 --> 03:46.040
You know, Harry. If you spent
some time working

03:46.120 --> 03:48.920
rather than doing the rounds
maculating your employees,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.680
this office might
be taken seriously.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.760
Yeah, no one's talking
to you, Blu.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.480
Beer on me tonight, huh?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.720
- Okay.
- That's the spirit.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.360
Honestly, well done on
that account, mate.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.560
Brass balls, eh?

04:14.240 --> 04:15.440
Oh, hi, Daniel.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.959
- Morning Chris.
- How are you?

04:17.040 --> 04:19.160
- I'm good, thanks. How are you?
- Good.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.040
- Glad it's Friday.
- Yes.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.440
- Coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.560
Oh, by the way, mate,
congratulations on that

04:31.640 --> 04:32.720
transfer account.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.520
- Thank you.
- Honestly, it's good work.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.640
Thanks.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.440
So how are you
finding the place?

04:39.360 --> 04:41.760
Yeah, it's, um, it's good.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.480
Yeah, everyone's friendly,
and I'm enjoying the work.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.120
Good. Good, I'm glad.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.960
- Uh, here you go.
- Thank you.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.080
Uh, look,
if you ever need anything,

05:01.320 --> 05:02.600
here's my card.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200
Thanks.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.280
Your welcome. Have a nice day.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.520
Yeah, you, too.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.920
- congratulations!
- Thanks.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.200
So I guess you're going
to be staying here longer then?

05:18.280 --> 05:20.360
- It looks that way.
- Cool.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.040
- Chris is nice.
- Oy, yeah. He's lovely.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.160
Unlike Harry. You just have
to ignore him.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.720
He's like that with everyone.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.680
Talking of the devil,

05:28.760 --> 05:31.000
I need to make him
a cup of coffee.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.800
- Yeah, back to work.
- Yeah.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
Oh, Dan?

05:36.720 --> 05:39.160
- Oh, thank you.
- No, worries, "brass balls."

06:56.880 --> 06:58.560
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.640
Danny boy.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.320
Everything alright, mate?

07:02.400 --> 07:04.040
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.040
Yeah. Uh-huh.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.840
Well, see you out there, mate.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.800
- Alright?
- Yeah.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.200
Sorry, can you spare me?

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
Thanks.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.480
Cheers, mate.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.240
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.360
Am I, uh, interrupting?

08:31.960 --> 08:33.000
So...

08:36.559 --> 08:38.280
What do you think? Hm?

08:41.360 --> 08:42.600
Girl in there?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.560
Yeah, she's nice.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.280
She is.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.320
Who are you fucking then?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.880
Go on, who are you fucking?

09:02.360 --> 09:04.160
- No one.
- No one?

09:06.760 --> 09:10.120
You've been in London, what,
three months?

09:10.960 --> 09:13.680
You need to get laid, mate.
You need to get laid.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.080
Hey, hey, hey. I'm just joking,
I'm just joking.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.160
But...

09:22.440 --> 09:24.240
I need you around, mate.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.800
Okay, come on. Come on.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.160
- Give us two minutes.
- Alright.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.640
Okay. I'll see you
in there, alright?

09:37.960 --> 09:40.240
Lover boy, right? Lover boy.

09:53.240 --> 09:54.320
Daniel!

09:56.240 --> 09:57.240
Daniel.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.520
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.600
- How are you?
- Yeah.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.640
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.280
So do you.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.520
So why are you sneaking out?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.680
How did you know
I was doing that?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.720
I was spying on you
from across the road.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.600
I'm joking.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.280
I just wanted to hide
from the new lot

10:28.360 --> 10:30.080
and sat here
with a friend at the bar.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.200
Oh, okay.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.560
There's my ride.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.960
Do you want to join us
for a dance and drink?

10:39.040 --> 10:43.160
Uh, I need to get back,
but next time.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.176
- Thanks for the offer.
- Well, if you want to come,

10:45.200 --> 10:46.400
address is on the back.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.160
See ya.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.320
Hi,
this is Daniel Reed.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.576
Sorry I can't get
to the phone right now.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.920
Leave a name, number,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
and a brief message,
I'll get back to you.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.040
Dan, it's me.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.920
I've been meaning
to find something.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.976
Look, I know
it's a couple of months

11:26.000 --> 11:28.120
since it all happened,
and well...

11:29.760 --> 11:33.880
I just want to try and sort
things out between us.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.400
It'll be your mum's birthday
next week.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.360
I think it's the right time.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.520
Remember that time
when you were seven,

11:53.560 --> 11:55.120
we had that day at the beach.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.480
I found the old video.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
I miss her, Daniel.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.600
I miss you, too.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.240
Your mum always understood you
better than I did.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.320
The door's always open.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.280
Good morning, handsome.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.080
Let me guess, "Where am I?
What did I do?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.960
How did I get here?"

15:11.800 --> 15:13.320
Yeah, something like that.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.880
You know, you were a hit
in there earlier.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.320
It's okay to be one
of the lost ones.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.720
You don't have
to be lost forever.

15:42.880 --> 15:43.920
Thanks.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.200
- Daniel.
- I know.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.160
Jennifer.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.800
- Thanks for the cig.
- It's yours.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.120
Oh.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.680
See you.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.280
See you soon.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.600
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.160
Brought you some breakfast.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.280
Do you want to come in?

18:09.480 --> 18:10.960
How do you know
where I live, Blu?

18:11.240 --> 18:13.120
You told me last night, stupid.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.000
Last night?

18:16.280 --> 18:17.320
Lost and Found?

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
Sugar?

18:23.560 --> 18:24.560
Daniel?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.520
No, thanks.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.480
Why are you here, Blu?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.320
Tonight's your big night.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.160
I can't remember last night,
I was so drunk.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.160
Shut up and eat your breakfast.
Everything's fine.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.760
Hey, Jen. You okay?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.720
Look can you get
there early tonight?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.760
- I'm going to be late.
- Yeah, that's fine.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.000
How's Daniel?

18:56.080 --> 18:57.520
Yeah, he's fine.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.176
I've made sure he's got
everything he needs,

19:00.200 --> 19:01.200
so it's all good.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.120
Good. Well, take care of it,
would you?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.320
- Yeah.
- Good.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.480
- Okay, love you.
- Love you.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.520
Love you, bye!

19:11.800 --> 19:12.800
Who was that?

19:13.760 --> 19:15.520
- Jen.
- Jen?

19:19.880 --> 19:22.280
Yeah, I, um...

19:26.440 --> 19:28.240
Whatever I said to you
last night...

19:29.880 --> 19:31.360
I...

19:33.680 --> 19:35.560
I was joking.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.840
Do you seriously don't remember
last night?

19:46.280 --> 19:47.640
Daniel, it's fine.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.280
I'm not going to treat
this like a joke

19:50.360 --> 19:51.760
like those twats
at the office.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.600
Look, it's okay.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.880
I think you should leave.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.520
Daniel, it's fine.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.840
- I understand.
- You understand?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.160
Just go, please.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.040
Please.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.880
Daniel, it's me.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.440
Um, I just want to try
and sort things out between us.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.760
Your mum always understood
you better than I did.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.360
I miss her, Daniel.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.400
And I miss you, too.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.600
The door's always open.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.440
You don't have
to be lost forever.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.120
Can I help you?

25:55.280 --> 25:58.560
Yeah, I've come to speak
to Blu.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.696
I think you should
leave right now.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.520
No, no, no. I know Blu.
I work with her.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.040
This is Lost and Found, right?

26:08.480 --> 26:10.240
Look, I was here last night.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.440
I've got a Lost and Found card.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.480
There she is.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.280
Thank you.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
Blu?

26:51.200 --> 26:53.080
- Hey.
- Daniel.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.440
I needed to come and say

26:56.520 --> 26:58.000
that I'm really sorry
I shouted...

26:58.200 --> 26:59.320
Daniel, it's fine.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.760
Everything I said
last night to you...

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
You don't need
to explain yourself.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.440
I understand.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.400
Good luck.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.840
Hi, Daniel.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.320
You're covered I see.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.800
Yeah, that was a...

27:33.840 --> 27:35.280
A wild night.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.440
Yeah.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.480
You're always welcomed here.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.240
You're part of the family now.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.280
Thank you.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.680
See you soon.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.480
Hey, Dad.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.760
Bye-bye.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.520
- Good morning, Daniel.
- Hi, Jan. How are you?

30:07.600 --> 30:08.920
I'm well, thank you. And you?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.080
I'm good, thank you.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.360
- What time is it?
- It is 10 past eight.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.000
Ten past eight, thank you.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.800
Hey, cheeky chops!

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
Morning.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.000
Jan. Jan!

30:29.000 --> 30:30.040
Jan!

30:33.920 --> 30:37.120
- Oh, thank god it's Friday.
- Yeah.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.160
That's a really lovely dress
by the way.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.720
Oh, thank you.
I only got it yesterday.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.200
Have a nice day.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.960
You, too.
Have a lovey day, Daniel.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.400
He's a nice boy, isn't he,
cheeky chops?

31:03.640 --> 31:04.680
What do you think?

31:05.240 --> 31:06.440
You were smiling, right?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.336
I haven't seen you smile
like that for a while.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.360
Not for me anyway.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.840
- Save it, Harry.
- Well, don't you like him?

31:12.240 --> 31:13.360
Don't worry, we all do.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.800
Your post is on your desk.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.400
Alright, did you open it?

31:31.760 --> 31:33.280
Yeah, right.
Well, you know what?

31:33.360 --> 31:34.520
I was working.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.640
Uh, Blu, coffee.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.120
You either evolve,
or you fucking die, yeah.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.560
Evolve or die, I've said it
to you before.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.320
Alright, you think about that.

32:11.280 --> 32:16.160
Danny boy. Drinks tonight,
nine o'clock.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.920
And no sneaking away.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.280
No sneaking off like last time.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.720
What? What are you on?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.160
Evening, ladies.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.920
Evening, Gingee.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I said, evening ladies!

35:59.080 --> 36:00.560
Evening, Gingee!

36:00.720 --> 36:02.440
Okay, Jen, how's it going?

36:02.520 --> 36:05.440
I don't know.
I think I'm just about done.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.840
Why, how do I look?

36:09.720 --> 36:10.760
There are no words.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.920
And that is why I love you.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.640
- Daniel.
- Sorry.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.880
Daniel, wait.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.280
I can't even walk in these,
and my wig...

43:56.360 --> 43:57.440
And I just feel so...

44:03.480 --> 44:04.880
You look fantastic.

44:08.040 --> 44:09.040
Really?

44:14.880 --> 44:15.880
Daniel.

44:22.600 --> 44:23.600
You know,

44:25.720 --> 44:27.360
I've kept this in
all these years.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.080
I don't...

44:30.680 --> 44:32.360
I've never told anyone.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.480
Itâ€™s that one person.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.240
And she understood.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.320
I'm sorry.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.320
I don't know why I'm telling
you this...

44:58.800 --> 45:00.720
I'm just really scared.

45:01.880 --> 45:03.000
It's okay.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.720
These things take time.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.360
Oh, god. I'm sorry.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.040
Look at you. You're here!

45:19.160 --> 45:21.400
Not everyone feels comfortable
the first time.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.200
You make a beautiful
young woman.

45:39.520 --> 45:40.520
Showtime.

51:03.640 --> 51:04.840
Daniel.

51:33.560 --> 51:38.080
Oh, Danny.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.360
Hello?

52:06.640 --> 52:07.760
Hello?

55:18.360 --> 55:19.760
I was like you once.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.320
She's proud.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.200
Follow this path,

55:40.480 --> 55:42.320
and don't get lost.
