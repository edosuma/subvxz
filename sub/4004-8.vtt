11:19.250 --> 11:20.625
NEW CLIENT.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.291
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. MORGAN,

11:22.291 --> 11:24.125
ESPECIALLY UNDER
BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.000
- CALL ME DEXTER.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.417
- JORDAN.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.500
CAN I OFFER YOU A DRINK?

11:27.500 --> 11:30.709
- UH, NO, THANKS.
I'M GOOD.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.458
- THINK I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.
- YOU DO?

11:32.458 --> 11:35.834
- YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR A WAY
TO COPE WITH YOUR LOSS.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.291
I KNOW
YOUR HISTORY, DEXTER.

11:37.291 --> 11:39.750
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED YOU
WHEN WE MET AT THE STATION,

11:39.750 --> 11:41.792
BUT IT HIT ME LATER ON.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.125
YOU WIFE WAS MURDERED.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.792
- YES.

11:44.792 --> 11:46.041
- THEY ANY CLOSER
TO CATCHING TRINITY?

11:47.834 --> 11:49.333
- NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.583
- I FOLLOWED THAT CASE
VERY CLOSELY.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.542
TRINITY--A RELIGIOUS MAN,

11:53.542 --> 11:55.542
FAMILY, GOOD LIFE.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.625
YET HE WAS WORKING
THROUGH SUCH RAGE,

11:57.625 --> 11:59.709
HARBORING
SO MANY SECRETS.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.583
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
HE FASCINATED ME

12:01.583 --> 12:02.709
ON A DEEP LEVEL.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.959
- WHAT ELSE DO JORDAN
AND I HAVE IN COMMON?

12:04.959 --> 12:08.083
- I CERTAINLY DON'T MEAN
TO IMPLY ANY SYMPATHY FOR HIM.

12:08.083 --> 12:12.125
HE'S A MONSTER,
NO QUESTION.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.041
I CAN'T IMAGINE
YOUR FRUSTRATION,

12:14.041 --> 12:17.375
KNOWING HE'S OUT THERE,
UNPUNISHED.

12:17.375 --> 12:19.208
- IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.208
- NO DOUBT.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.542
- AND NOW YOU'RE
A SINGLE FATHER,

12:22.542 --> 12:23.750
WHICH HAS ITS OWN SET
OF CHALLENGES.

12:28.458 --> 12:30.041
- WHY DID YOU
WANT TO SEE ME?

12:30.041 --> 12:32.750
- I'VE DEVELOPED A THEORY
ON HOW THE PRIMAL SELF

12:32.750 --> 12:35.041
DEALS WITH TRAGEDY.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.041
[exhales]

12:36.041 --> 12:38.083
I HAVE TO PREPARE
FOR THE NEXT SESSION,

12:38.083 --> 12:39.917
BUT I AM VERY INTERESTED
IN WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.291
I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
YOUR SITUATION IN DEPTH

12:42.291 --> 12:44.375
AT ANOTHER TIME
IF YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT.

12:44.375 --> 12:47.041
- OKAY.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.583
- OKAY.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.500
BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU MADE
ANY PROGRESS ON BOYD FOWLER?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.542
- I'M NOT REALLY AWARE
OF ALL THE DETAILS.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.583
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SPEAK
TO ONE OF THE DETECTIVES.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.083
- OF COURSE.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.041
I LOOK FORWARD
TO OUR NEXT TALK.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.041
THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
IN THERE FOR HARRISON.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.083
- THANKS.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.750
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

13:24.750 --> 13:26.291
- CLOSE THE DOOR.

13:33.291 --> 13:35.333
- [sighs]

13:35.333 --> 13:38.000
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF HEAT
COMING DOWN ON US,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.667
AND THE PUBLIC'S
DEMANDING BLOOD. OUR BLOOD.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.959
MATTHEWS WANTS
SOMEONE'S HEAD.

13:43.959 --> 13:46.000
- SOUNDS LIKE
SANTA MUERTA'S CATCHING ON.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.542
- I'M PUTTING CIRA MANZON
ON DISCIPLINARY LEAVE.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.417
- WHAT?

13:52.417 --> 13:54.041
- I NEED TO PUT
A FACE ON IT.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.709
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR FACE?

13:55.709 --> 13:56.667
- DETECTIVE--

13:56.667 --> 13:59.458
- YOU CAN'T PIN THIS
ON HER.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.166
- HER ACTIONS PRECIPITATED
THE SHOOTING.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.709
- SHE WASN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.583
I TRIED TO TAKE HER OFF,
AND YOU WOULDN'T LET ME.

14:04.583 --> 14:05.625
- THAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.667
- NO, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.792
LOOK, I WAS
THE DETECTIVE IN CHARGE,

14:10.792 --> 14:13.458
SO IF YOU WANT TO FUCK
SOMEBODY OVER,

14:13.458 --> 14:14.333
HERE'S YOUR SCAPEGOAT.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.166
- I KNOW YOUR INSTINCT

14:16.166 --> 14:17.959
IS TO TAKE THE FALL
FOR YOUR TEAM.

14:17.959 --> 14:19.417
- YOU WERE ON MY TEAM.

14:19.417 --> 14:22.125
IN FACT, YOU FUCKIN'
TOOK OVER MY TEAM,

14:22.125 --> 14:23.250
AND I HAD YOUR BACK,

14:23.250 --> 14:24.375
'CAUSE YOUR TEAM, MY TEAM,
WHATEVER,

14:24.375 --> 14:25.333
IT'S ALL THE FUCKIN' SAME.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.333
- CIRA'S JUST STARTING OUT.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.500
HER CAREER WILL TAKE
THE SMALLEST HIT.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.291
SHE'LL RECOVER QUICKLY.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.834
- IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HAD HAPPENED TO ME BACK THEN,

14:34.834 --> 14:36.542
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
MADE DETECTIVE.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.166
WE WERE ALL THERE TOGETHER.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.625
SO WHY CAN'T
WE JUST HOLD TIGHT

14:41.625 --> 14:45.041
AND WEATHER
THE FUCKIN' STORM TOGETHER?

14:45.041 --> 14:46.500
FUCKIN' THINK ABOUT IT.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.250
[door opens and closes]

14:58.875 --> 15:00.750
[cell phone rings]

15:00.750 --> 15:04.208
- DOES YOUR PRINTER
EVER WORK?

15:04.208 --> 15:05.208
- LU?

15:07.208 --> 15:08.834
- OWEN.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.792
- HOW ARE YOU?

15:11.792 --> 15:13.333
- UM...

15:13.333 --> 15:15.542
UM...

15:15.542 --> 15:17.542
- I BET YOU'RE TAN.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.583
THE SUN FEELS CLOSER HERE,

15:19.583 --> 15:21.583
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT ACTUALLY
PHYSICALLY IS NOT,

15:21.583 --> 15:23.417
IT FEELS LIKE
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

15:23.417 --> 15:24.625
- YOU'RE IN MIAMI?

15:25.917 --> 15:28.417
- I GOT A SUNBURN
JUST RENTING THE CAR.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.458
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

15:32.458 --> 15:34.000
- YOU DID?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.917
- LU, I'VE RESPECTED
YOUR WISHES.

15:35.917 --> 15:37.166
SINCE THE DAY
OF THE WEDDING,

15:37.166 --> 15:38.417
I HAVEN'T CALLED,
I HAVEN'T EMAILED,

15:38.417 --> 15:40.625
I HAVEN'T EVEN TEXTED.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.417
IT'S LIKE MY LIFE
STOPPED THAT DAY

15:42.417 --> 15:43.792
WHEN YOU LEFT,

15:43.792 --> 15:46.417
AND I NEED TO GET UNSTUCK.

15:46.417 --> 15:49.917
I FEEL THE WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO SEE YOU, FACE TO FACE,

15:49.917 --> 15:52.291
WITHOUT 75 OF OUR CLOSEST
FRIENDS AND FAMILY

15:52.291 --> 15:54.583
STARING AT US.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.542
PLEASE, WILL YOU SEE ME?

16:00.458 --> 16:02.458
- I...AHEM.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.792
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.750
- TOMORROW.
[car engine rumbling]

16:05.750 --> 16:07.875
[engine stops,
door opens]

16:07.875 --> 16:09.834
LU?

16:09.834 --> 16:11.917
I'M STAYING AT
THE BLUE PELICAN MOTEL.

16:11.917 --> 16:13.458
THERE'S A CAFE
ACROSS THE STREET.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.125
MEET ME THERE TOMORROW
AT NOON, OKAY?

16:15.125 --> 16:16.875
- OKAY, NOON.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.875
[phone beeps]

16:18.875 --> 16:20.208
- HEY.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.750
- HEY.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.125
- I GOT YOU SOME SUPPER.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.000
HOT AND SOUR SOUP,
FRIED RICE WITH TOFU.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.625
THAT'S WHAT YOU LIKE,
RIGHT?

16:26.625 --> 16:28.959
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.959
- NO, I'M NOT STAYING.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.291
- OH, RIGHT.

16:35.291 --> 16:36.583
HARRISON.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.041
- YOU'RE TIRED.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.083
- I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY

16:43.083 --> 16:44.792
STARING AT THAT LAPTOP,

16:44.792 --> 16:47.583
AND I GOT EXACTLY NOWHERE.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.041
- WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS

16:49.041 --> 16:51.291
YOU WON'T BE
ON THAT COMPUTER TOMORROW.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.792
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED YOU TO DO.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.000
- WHAT?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.667
- SHOPPING.
- WHAT KIND OF SHOPPING?

16:55.667 --> 16:57.917
- SUPPLIES.
WE HAVE TO MAKE A ROOM

16:57.917 --> 17:00.792
WHERE COLE
WILL BE DISPATCHED.

17:00.792 --> 17:02.542
IT HAS TO BE COVERED
IN PLASTIC.

17:02.542 --> 17:03.792
SO DOES COLE.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.125
- TO CATCH THE BLOOD.

17:08.834 --> 17:09.959
- I MADE A LIST.

17:11.375 --> 17:16.166
DUCT TAPE, 30 YARDS
OF CLEAR POLYETHYLENE SHEETING.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.125
- AND GARBAGE BAGS,
THREE MIL, BLACK.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.000
- WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA DO IT?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.709
- TOMORROW.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.750
I BOOKED A ROOM
RIGHT NEXT TO COLE'S.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.542
- YOU'RE GONNA DO IT
IN THE HOTEL?

17:27.542 --> 17:29.041
- NO CHOICE.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.458
JORDAN'S NEXT GIG
IS IN SARASOTA.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.041
HE AND COLE WILL BE
HITTING THE ROAD

17:33.041 --> 17:34.166
RIGHT AFTER
THE SEMINAR ENDS.

17:35.875 --> 17:41.291
- SO TOMORROW NIGHT'S
THE NIGHT.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.000
- THERE'S A PARKING LOT
RIGHT ON THE CORNER

17:43.000 --> 17:44.542
OF FOURTH AND BAY.

17:44.542 --> 17:45.917
MEET ME THERE
TOMORROW AT NOON,

17:45.917 --> 17:47.458
AND I'LL PICK UP
THE SUPPLIES.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.375
- 1:00 WOULD BE BETTER,

17:50.375 --> 17:52.750
JUST SO I HAVE
ENOUGH TIME TO SHOP.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.208
- SURE.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.250
WHAT?

17:57.917 --> 18:00.792
- A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS
SHOPPING FOR A WEDDING DRESS,

18:00.792 --> 18:03.542
AND NOW I'M SHOPPING FOR...

18:03.542 --> 18:07.000
30 YARDS
OF POLYETHYLENE SHEETING.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.500
IT'S CRAZY, ISN'T IT,

18:08.500 --> 18:12.750
HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN GET USED
TO THE SUPREMELY WEIRD?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.625
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.250
- THANKS FOR COVERING.
- NO PROBLEM.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.125
SONYA JUST LEFT.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.000
UCH. JORDAN CHASE.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.959
I KNOW YOU'RE HURTING,
SO I'LL RESERVE JUDGMENT,

18:37.959 --> 18:39.625
BUT I GOTTA DRAW
THE LINE SOMEWHERE.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.417
- IT WAS FREE.

18:44.709 --> 18:45.750
IT CAN'T HURT, CAN IT?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.083
MAYBE I'LL COME AWAY
WITH SOMETHING.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.166
- YEAH, A REALLY UGLY ONESIE.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.917
I DON'T KNOW.

18:50.917 --> 18:53.792
IF IT'S WORKING, WHO AM I
TO POOP ON YOUR PARADE?

18:53.792 --> 18:56.667
- AND YOUR DAY?

18:56.667 --> 19:00.583
- I'VE GOT SIX MANDATORY
SESSIONS WITH A SHRINK

19:00.583 --> 19:03.250
COMING AT ME
BECAUSE OF CARLOS FUENTES.

19:04.792 --> 19:07.125
FEELS LIKE A BIG, FAT
FUCKING WASTE OF TIME, TOO.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.125
I MEAN, I'D KILL THAT FUCKTARD
ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.333
I'D EMPTY
A FUCKING MAGAZINE IN HIM.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.875
OKAY.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.625
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING
WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.709
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IF I LANDED A BULLET

19:23.709 --> 19:25.750
THAT IT WOULD BOTHER ME.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.166
THAT IT WOULD...

19:31.166 --> 19:34.166
IT WOULD BE A BURDEN
TO TAKE ANOTHER LIFE.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.166
THEY DON'T ISSUE GUNS
TO LAB GEEKS,

19:39.166 --> 19:41.083
SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:41.083 --> 19:44.625
- I CAN IMAGINE.

19:44.625 --> 19:45.959
- I DON'T FEEL BAD.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.834
ME, OF ALL PEOPLE.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.333
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.667
MAYBE I'VE JUST RUN OUT.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.125
- DAD ONCE TOLD ME THAT...

20:03.041 --> 20:04.959
SOME PEOPLE
DESERVE TO DIE.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.792
- YOU BELIEVE THAT?

20:12.083 --> 20:14.208
YOU BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE
DESERVE TO DIE?

20:14.208 --> 20:16.917
- SOME PEOPLE DON'T
DESERVE TO LIVE.

20:18.709 --> 20:19.834
- TRINITY SHOULD BE DEAD.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.417
NOT RITA, NOT LUNDY.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.458
MAYBE THE WORLD
IS BETTER OFF

20:27.458 --> 20:29.375
WITHOUT CARLOS FUENTES.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.458
- I'D PRETTY MUCH
GIVEN UP HOPE.

20:37.458 --> 20:41.125
I FIGURED I WAS DESTINED
TO GO THROUGH LIFE ALONE,

20:41.125 --> 20:42.875
AND THEN I STARTED LISTENING
TO ONE OF YOUR CDs.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.500
- THE PRIMAL SELF?

20:44.500 --> 20:46.875
- I STARTED LISTENING
IN THE CAR ON THE WAY TO WORK.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.208
THREE WEEKS LATER,

20:48.208 --> 20:49.625
I MET MY SOUL MATE,

20:49.625 --> 20:51.125
AND NOW WE HAVE
A BABY ON THE WAY!

20:51.125 --> 20:53.041
[cheers and applause]

20:53.041 --> 20:53.959
- COME ON UP HERE.

20:53.959 --> 20:55.625
- COME ON!
COME ON, HONEY!

21:04.083 --> 21:05.458
Dexter: COLE WILL BE
AT HIS POST

21:05.458 --> 21:06.917
FOR THE REST
OF THE SESSION.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.375
THAT GIVES ME AN HOUR.

21:14.625 --> 21:15.709
[lock beeps]

21:38.417 --> 21:40.417
[aerosol hissing]

21:41.583 --> 21:43.458
I'LL HAVE TO DO THIS
IN THE DARK.

21:43.458 --> 21:46.291
14 STEPS TO THE PILLOW,

21:46.291 --> 21:49.542
GIVE HIM THE NEEDLE,
AND DRAG HIM TO MY ROOM.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.792
60 SECONDS TOPS.

21:55.959 --> 21:58.917
JORDAN'S ABOUT TO LOSE
HIS NUMBER ONE FAN.

22:11.917 --> 22:13.625
- OH.
- SORRY.

22:13.625 --> 22:14.625
- NO, NO, IT'S ME.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.125
REALLY.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.083
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.333
- I DON'T, REALLY.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.500
- YOU DO.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.709
YOU ALWAYS DO.

22:29.166 --> 22:30.834
MIAMI SUITS YOU.
- [scoffs]

22:30.834 --> 22:33.166
- YOU MUST LOVE
ALL THESE ART DECO BUILDINGS.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.333
- CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF 'EM.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.208
- STEPH HAD HER BABY.

22:40.208 --> 22:41.667
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.333
SHE WAS DUE LAST MONTH.

22:43.333 --> 22:47.667
- YES. MEET MAVIS.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.417
- LOOK AT HER.

22:49.417 --> 22:50.875
MAVIS?

22:50.875 --> 22:52.291
- MARK'S GRANDMOTHER.

22:52.291 --> 22:54.166
THE NAME CAME DOWN
TO MAVIS OR MADISON.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.250
- MADISON.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.667
YOUR NIECE COULD
HAVE BEEN NAMED

22:56.667 --> 23:00.166
AFTER THE CITY WHERE YOU AND I
DID OUR SUNDAY BEER RUNS.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.208
- COOLER HEADS PREVAILED--
MINE.

23:02.208 --> 23:05.041
- HOW IS STEPH DOING?

23:05.041 --> 23:06.458
- SHE'S TIRED,

23:06.458 --> 23:08.375
GLAD TO NOT BE PREGNANT
ANYMORE,

23:08.375 --> 23:10.208
CRIES AT COMMERCIALS...

23:10.208 --> 23:13.166
AND IS
TRANSCENDENTLY HAPPY.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.417
YOUR PARENTS MISS YOU.

23:16.417 --> 23:19.083
THEY'D LIKE TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE SAFE.

23:19.083 --> 23:22.333
- YOU CAN TELL THEM.

23:22.333 --> 23:25.667
- WELL, I'M THINKING
OF NOT GOING BACK, TOO.

23:25.667 --> 23:27.000
- WHAT?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.709
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.709
WE WERE TRAPPED IN OUR JOBS,
TRAPPED IN THAT CITY.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.625
WE'D HAVE BEEN TRAPPED
IN A LIFE WE DIDN'T WANT.

23:32.625 --> 23:33.875
IT'S TIME
FOR THAT TO CHANGE.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.792
- OWEN?

23:37.792 --> 23:39.750
- LU...

23:39.750 --> 23:41.750
I BOUGHT THESE
ROUND THE WORLD TICKETS.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.083
BROKE THE BANK.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.917
WE CAN LITERALLY HOP ON
AND HOP OFF IN ANY CITY.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.500
I LOVE YOU.

23:48.500 --> 23:52.000
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
WHOEVER YOU ARE,

23:52.000 --> 23:53.875
I WANT TO TAKE
THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU.

23:59.417 --> 24:01.250
HAVE YOU MET SOMEONE?

24:01.250 --> 24:03.208
- I'VE MET
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE,

24:03.208 --> 24:05.583
BUT NOT
LIKE YOU'RE THINKING.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.083
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

24:08.083 --> 24:12.000
ME SHOWING UP LIKE THIS
IS SUDDEN, I KNOW.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.208
WE HAD FIVE YEARS.

24:14.208 --> 24:17.625
TAKE A NIGHT
TO THINK IT OVER.

24:17.625 --> 24:21.417
I'M GOING EITHER WAY,
BUT I'D RATHER GO WITH YOU.

24:21.417 --> 24:24.125
MEET ME HERE
TOMORROW NIGHT

24:24.125 --> 24:25.667
AND TELL ME
YOUR DECISION.

24:29.625 --> 24:31.417
- GOD FUCKING DAMN IT.

24:31.417 --> 24:33.542
- WHAT IS IT?
- UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE.

24:33.542 --> 24:35.291
- LIEUTENANT,
WILL THERE BE ANY OTHER--

24:35.291 --> 24:36.667
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOUR SOURCES ARE,

24:36.667 --> 24:38.583
BUT I CAN CONFIRM
THAT DETECTIVE MORGAN

24:38.583 --> 24:40.166
WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE OPERATION.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.458
- HOLY SHIT.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.166
- SHE'S BLAMING
EVERYTHING ON ME.

24:43.166 --> 24:44.625
- IS IT TRUE
THAT DETECTIVE MORGAN

24:44.625 --> 24:46.417
HAS BEEN PLACED
ON DISCIPLINARY LEAVE?

24:46.417 --> 24:48.458
- AS OF TODAY,
SHE'S BEING PLACED

24:48.458 --> 24:50.333
ON IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION
WITH PAY,

24:50.333 --> 24:52.000
PENDING THE RESULTS OF--

24:52.000 --> 24:54.041
- WHOA! NOT THE PLASMA.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.375
- EXCUSE ME.

24:55.375 --> 24:56.959
- I THOUGHT WE WERE
ACTUALLY FRIENDS.

24:56.959 --> 25:00.083
- DEB, WAIT.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.834
- I CAN'T DO IT.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.458
I CAN'T LET HER THROW ME
UNDER THE BUS

25:03.458 --> 25:04.834
AND DRIVE OVER ME,

25:04.834 --> 25:08.000
THEN BACK UP A FEW FUCKIN' TIMES
AND DRIVE OFF.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.375
[engine starts]

25:21.750 --> 25:22.542
[crash]

25:25.208 --> 25:27.917
- FUCK! SHIT! FUCK!

25:27.917 --> 25:29.417
DIDN'T YOU
SEE ME DRIVING UP?

25:29.417 --> 25:30.917
- DIDN'T YOU SEE ME
BACKING OUT?

25:30.917 --> 25:32.000
- YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A REASON

25:32.000 --> 25:35.250
WHY CARS
HAVE REARVIEW MIRRORS, LADY!

25:35.250 --> 25:37.458
I MEAN, SHIT,
LOOK AT THAT.

25:37.458 --> 25:40.250
THIS HERE'S FIBERGLASS.
CAN'T POUND THAT OUT.

25:40.250 --> 25:41.875
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PULL
THAT WHOLE QUARTER PANEL OFF.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.500
- HOW DO I KNOW
IT WASN'T ALREADY THERE?

25:43.500 --> 25:45.792
- YOU JUST HIT MY CAR.

25:45.792 --> 25:48.959
- I WAS DISTRACTED.
JUST LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CASH.

25:48.959 --> 25:51.208
- NO CASH!
I DON'T WANT CASH!

25:51.208 --> 25:52.667
WE'LL DO THIS
ON THE UP-AND-UP,

25:52.667 --> 25:54.041
'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND
OF GUY I AM.

25:54.041 --> 25:56.750
WE JUST LET THE INSURANCE DUDES
HASH THIS OUT.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.542
YOU DO HAVE INSURANCE,
DON'T YOU?

25:58.542 --> 26:02.041
- YEAH.
- WELL, HALLE-FUCKIN'-LUJAH.

26:02.041 --> 26:04.166
NOW, LET'S JUST, UH,
TRADE SOME INFO HERE

26:04.166 --> 26:06.709
AND GET THIS SORTED OUT.

26:06.709 --> 26:11.417
LOOK, NOW, WE CAN EITHER
DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY,

26:11.417 --> 26:12.792
OR I CAN CALL UP THE PO-LICE,

26:12.792 --> 26:14.166
LET MIAMI'S FINEST
HANDLE IT.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.000
IT'S YOUR CALL.
- NO.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.667
NO, NO, NO. I...

26:26.625 --> 26:28.583
female announcer: THE JORDAN
CHASE EXPERIENCE SEMINAR

26:28.583 --> 26:30.834
WILL RESUME TOMORROW
AT 8:00 A.M. SHARP.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.417
VENDORS ARE OPEN TONIGHT
TILL 7:00 P.M.

26:32.417 --> 26:34.792
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

26:34.792 --> 26:36.875
Dexter: I GUESS WORKING
FOR JORDAN HAS ITS BENEFITS.

26:36.875 --> 26:38.250
[cell phone rings]

26:38.250 --> 26:39.291
[beeps]

26:39.291 --> 26:40.500
HELLO?

26:40.500 --> 26:41.709
- I'M HERE.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.083
- I'M ON MY WAY.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.917
- NO, I MEAN,
I'M HERE IN THE LOBBY.

26:52.208 --> 26:53.792
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:53.792 --> 26:55.500
- I GOT
INTO A CAR ACCIDENT.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.041
- ARE YOU OKAY?

26:57.041 --> 26:58.792
- YEAH, YEAH.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.125
IT WAS MY FAULT.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.041
ACTUALLY, NO,
IT WAS OWEN'S FAULT.

27:03.750 --> 27:04.583
- OWEN WHO?

27:05.834 --> 27:08.625
- MY EX-FIANCE.

27:08.625 --> 27:09.792
HE'S IN MIAMI.

27:11.625 --> 27:14.083
- WHY?

27:14.083 --> 27:16.000
- HE CAME TO SEE ME.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.959
DON'T WORRY, I DIDN'T TELL
HIM ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.750
HE ASKED ME
TO GO AWAY WITH HIM.

27:22.750 --> 27:27.959
JUST UP
AND LEAVE ALL THIS BEHIND.

27:27.959 --> 27:29.083
[laughs]

27:31.125 --> 27:32.750
AS IF I COULD.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.917
- YOU COULD, YOU KNOW.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.750
- DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

27:40.750 --> 27:42.709
- IF YOU WANT TO...

27:42.709 --> 27:44.166
GO.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.208
- THIS IS THE ONLY PART
OF MY LIFE

27:50.208 --> 27:51.792
THAT MAKES SENSE
ANYMORE.

27:53.583 --> 27:54.917
- WHAT ABOUT OWEN?

27:54.917 --> 27:55.875
- HE'S LEAVING.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.542
- WHEN?
- TOMORROW.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.166
- STAY THE NIGHT.

28:03.583 --> 28:05.166
THE SEMINAR'S
OUT FOR THE DAY,

28:05.166 --> 28:07.000
AND COLE COULD BE ANYWHERE.
HE COULD SEE YOU.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.041
IT'S TOO RISKY TO HAVE YOU
WALK THROUGH THE LOBBY AGAIN.

28:09.041 --> 28:12.959
- IF I STAY,

28:12.959 --> 28:15.500
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE
NOT GONNA KILL COLE TONIGHT?

28:15.500 --> 28:17.542
- NO, IT'S STILL HAPPENING.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.542
WE'RE GONNA PREPARE
THE ROOM TOGETHER.

28:31.792 --> 28:33.041
[lock clicks]

28:49.750 --> 28:52.041
Dexter: THIS IS ALL MUCH EASIER
WITH A PARTNER.

29:01.291 --> 29:03.041
BUT A PARTNER IN WHAT?

29:05.542 --> 29:06.709
[door slams]

29:06.709 --> 29:08.208
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

29:08.208 --> 29:09.667
- I WAS PLANNING TO.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.875
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE PRESS
GOT HOLD OF IT.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.083
- MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU FUCKING LEAKED IT.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.917
- YOU'LL BE A DESK JOCKEY
FOR A FEW WEEKS,

29:15.917 --> 29:18.000
THEN YOUR UNION REP
WILL HAVE YOU REINSTATED.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.750
THIS TIME NEXT YEAR,
ALL WILL HAVE BLOWN OVER.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.583
- IT'S JUST YOUR WORD
AGAINST MINE

29:22.583 --> 29:23.875
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
THAT WAS THERE.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.333
- SOME PEOPLE DON'T AGREE

29:25.333 --> 29:27.542
WITH YOUR VERSION
OF THE EVENTS.

29:27.542 --> 29:30.083
- WHO'D YOU GET
TO LIE FOR YOU?

29:30.083 --> 29:31.875
BATISTA?

29:31.875 --> 29:33.875
BATISTA'S GONNA BACK
YOUR FUCKIN' STORY?

29:33.875 --> 29:35.583
DO I HAVE TO GO
TO MATTHEWS WITH THIS?

29:35.583 --> 29:38.291
- YOU WATCH YOURSELF,
DETECTIVE.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.875
WE WOULDN'T WANT YOUR
REINSTATEMENT TO BE DELAYED.

29:42.083 --> 29:43.083
- GOD.

29:45.166 --> 29:48.750
- I WAS FUCKING HAPPY
FOR YOU WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.583
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT YOU
BEING WITH BATISTA

29:50.583 --> 29:51.959
MIGHT MAKE YOU
A NICER PERSON.

29:54.208 --> 29:56.625
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU
TO FUCKIN' EAT HIM ALIVE.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.083
[plastic rustling]

30:19.750 --> 30:21.875
- COLE'S OTHER VICTIMS.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.291
WHY DID YOU PUT
THEIR PICTURES UP?

30:24.291 --> 30:25.917
- COLE NEEDS TO SEE
WHAT HE'S DONE.

30:27.834 --> 30:29.375
- WHAT DO YOU GET
OUT OF ALL THIS?

30:29.375 --> 30:32.959
- I LIKE KNOWING THAT THE MEN
WHO DID THIS TO YOU

30:32.959 --> 30:34.750
WON'T DO IT TO ANYONE ELSE.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.542
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

30:41.834 --> 30:43.542
- YOU'RE STANDING HERE.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.875
- LOOK AT ALL THIS.

30:45.875 --> 30:48.834
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME,
YOU'D STILL BE IN THIS ROOM.

30:51.542 --> 30:53.291
BOYD WASN'T YOUR FIRST.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.041
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A LONG TIME.

31:02.083 --> 31:03.667
[door opens]

31:03.667 --> 31:05.041
- IT'S COLE.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.959
WE'LL WAIT FOR HIM
TO GO TO SLEEP,

31:08.959 --> 31:11.333
THEN YOU TAKE OFF
AND I GRAB HIM.

31:11.333 --> 31:12.834
- WHAT'S THAT?

31:12.834 --> 31:16.166
- M-99.
ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.542
GIVES ME A FEW HOURS
TO WRAP HIS BODY IN PLASTIC

31:19.542 --> 31:21.000
AND SECURE HIM
TO THIS DESK.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.041
- YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM
WHILE HE'S STILL OUT?

31:24.041 --> 31:25.458
- NO, I'M GONNA WAKE HIM UP,

31:25.458 --> 31:26.959
SEE IF HE'LL GIVE UP
THE OTHER TWO NAMES

31:26.959 --> 31:29.250
OF THE MEN
IN THE PICTURES.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.041
MY KNIFE CAN BE
VERY PERSUASIVE.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.250
[woman screams]

31:32.250 --> 31:34.125
STAY HERE.

31:34.125 --> 31:38.875
[screaming]

31:38.875 --> 31:43.250
[screaming,
bed thumping]

31:43.250 --> 31:45.041
- OWW!

31:45.041 --> 31:47.041
TIE MY OTHER ARM!

31:47.041 --> 31:49.417
DO IT NOW!

31:49.417 --> 31:51.250
UNH! YES!

31:51.250 --> 31:53.291
OHH! OHH!

31:53.291 --> 31:55.542
OHH!

31:55.542 --> 31:57.208
YES!

31:57.208 --> 32:00.917
OH, GOD! OH!

32:00.917 --> 32:03.333
[Lumen whimpering]

32:03.333 --> 32:05.917
[woman screams]

32:05.917 --> 32:07.333
- [whimpering]

32:07.333 --> 32:10.041
[softly crying]

32:10.041 --> 32:12.583
NO.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.583
NO!

32:14.583 --> 32:15.750
[woman screaming]

32:15.750 --> 32:17.542
[Lumen's screams fade in]

32:17.542 --> 32:22.375
NO! [screams]

32:22.375 --> 32:24.208
NO MORE! PLEASE!

32:24.208 --> 32:26.500
NO! [screams]

32:26.500 --> 32:27.917
NO! NO!

32:27.917 --> 32:30.333
NO! NO!

32:30.333 --> 32:32.000
NO! LET ME GO!

32:32.000 --> 32:34.291
NO! LET ME OUT OF HERE!

32:34.291 --> 32:37.417
[screams fade]

32:37.417 --> 32:39.041
[Lumen breathing]

32:58.458 --> 32:59.542
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:59.542 --> 33:00.792
- YOU FELL ASLEEP.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.208
- WHAT ABOUT COLE?

33:03.208 --> 33:07.250
- HE'S BACK
AT THE SEMINAR BY NOW.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.750
THE SCREAMER
SPENT THE NIGHT.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.208
- SO YOU'RE
NOT GONNA KILL HIM?

33:11.208 --> 33:12.875
- NO, I AM.

33:12.875 --> 33:15.375
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.750
COLE MAKES HIS SECURITY ROUNDS
AT EVERY SESSION.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.417
- SO...

33:19.417 --> 33:21.458
- I'LL WAIT FOR HIM
BY THE SERVICE ELEVATOR

33:21.458 --> 33:24.000
AND M-99 HIM THERE.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.750
I WOULD HAVE RATHER
GRABBED HIM AT NIGHT,

33:25.750 --> 33:26.667
BUT I CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.083
- AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

33:28.083 --> 33:30.709
- YOU'LL WAIT
UNTIL THE SESSION STARTS.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.166
EVERYONE WILL BE
IN THE SEMINAR.

33:32.166 --> 33:33.917
YOU WON'T BE SPOTTED
WHEN YOU LEAVE.

33:33.917 --> 33:36.333
JUST STEER CLEAR
OF THE SERVICE ELEVATOR.

33:36.333 --> 33:38.500
- OKAY.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.542
[exhales]

33:40.542 --> 33:42.333
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
- WHAT?

33:42.333 --> 33:45.458
- I ACTUALLY SLEPT.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.583
- HEY.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.500
DO YOU WANT TO GET UP?
- NO.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.875
- DO YOU WANT TO GO
BACK TO SLEEP?

34:01.875 --> 34:03.208
- NO.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.417
- DO YOU WANT TO JUST--

34:04.417 --> 34:05.959
NO, I JUST--I DON'T
WANT TO DO ANYTHING.

34:05.959 --> 34:07.417
I JUST WANT TO LIE HERE.

34:07.417 --> 34:09.000
IT'S SUNDAY.
I'M ALLOWED.

34:11.792 --> 34:14.500
- LAGUERTA'S AN EVIL BITCH.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.166
- NO, SHE'S NOT.

34:19.709 --> 34:22.375
MAYBE SHE IS.

34:22.375 --> 34:25.709
- THE BEST WAY
TO GET BACK AT HER

34:25.709 --> 34:27.500
IS TO DO
EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAYS.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.375
GO ON LEAVE,
TALK TO YOUR UNION REP,

34:29.375 --> 34:30.959
GET REINSTATED,

34:30.959 --> 34:34.834
THEN COME BACK AND KICK
AS MUCH ASS AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

34:34.834 --> 34:35.917
[doorbell rings]

34:37.709 --> 34:41.041
NO ONE,
NOT EVEN LAGUERTA,

34:41.041 --> 34:42.542
CAN DENY THAT YOU'RE
A GREAT DETECTIVE.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.417
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

34:44.417 --> 34:45.500
YOU'LL BE
THE ONE LEFT STANDING.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.750
- AT THEN END OF THE DAY?

34:46.750 --> 34:48.917
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE.

34:59.709 --> 35:01.625
- SOUNDS LIKE
ONE VERY LONG DAY.

35:06.667 --> 35:07.917
- HEY.

35:07.917 --> 35:09.375
[sniffs]
I SMELL COFFEE.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.417
- NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

35:10.417 --> 35:11.875
- WELL, IT IS FOR ME.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.125
HEY, DEBRA MORGAN.

35:15.125 --> 35:17.667
- LIDDY, RIGHT?
- GOOD MEMORY.

35:17.667 --> 35:18.667
I LIKE THIS ONE.

35:18.667 --> 35:20.792
- "THIS ONE"?

35:20.792 --> 35:22.166
- YOU AND I GOT
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

35:22.166 --> 35:23.917
WE'VE BOTH BEEN FUCKED OVER
BY LAGUERTA.

35:23.917 --> 35:24.917
- WELL,
MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE

35:24.917 --> 35:26.208
MATCHING T-SHIRTS
OR SOMETHING.

35:26.208 --> 35:27.125
- [laughs]

35:27.125 --> 35:28.875
- OKAY.
WELL, THIS ONE'S GOING

35:28.875 --> 35:30.792
FOR A FUCKIN'
BREAKFAST BURRITO.

35:30.792 --> 35:32.667
I'LL SEE YOU TWO LATER.

35:35.792 --> 35:37.875
- CALL BEFORE YOU COME OVER.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.166
IT'S A COMMON COURTESY.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.417
- DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS GIRL

35:40.417 --> 35:41.792
SHACKED UP
WITH DEXTER MORGAN?

35:41.792 --> 35:44.709
I JUST STAGED A LITTLE
MEET AND GREET WITH HER.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.083
OLD P.I. MOVE.

35:46.083 --> 35:47.125
- SO YOU MET HER.

35:47.125 --> 35:49.250
- NAME, LUMEN PIERCE.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.875
LUMEN--STUPID FUCKIN' NAME.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.458
FROM MINNEAPOLIS,
MINNESOTA.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.291
SUPPOSED TO BE MARRIED
THREE MONTHS AGO,

35:55.291 --> 35:56.667
PICTURE IN THE PAPER
AND EVERYTHING.

35:56.667 --> 35:57.792
JUST TAKES OFF.

35:57.792 --> 35:59.458
SHOWS UP HERE IN MIAMI

35:59.458 --> 36:04.083
ONE WEEK BEFORE YOUR BOY'S WIFE,
RITA MORGAN, IS MURDERED.

36:04.083 --> 36:04.959
NOW, WHAT
YOU THINK OF THAT?

36:04.959 --> 36:07.375
- I DON'T KNOW.
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

36:07.375 --> 36:08.792
- IT'S A HELL OF LOT MORE
THAN I HAD YESTERDAY.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.792
- WELL, STAY ON IT.

36:10.792 --> 36:12.959
- I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I AM RUNNING OUT OF LOOT.

36:12.959 --> 36:14.041
- I JUST PAID YOU
LAST WEEK.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.709
- AND I JUST
FUCKED UP MY CAR

36:15.709 --> 36:17.333
GETTING THIS INFO
FOR YOU QUINN.

36:17.333 --> 36:18.834
NOW, THIS BOY IS DIRTY.

36:18.834 --> 36:20.166
WHAT YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

36:20.166 --> 36:21.667
- I'M NOT GIVING YOU
ANY MORE.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.834
- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT YOU AND ME
HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.625
I MEAN, IT'D BE A SHAME

36:25.625 --> 36:28.375
IF THE SKIRT YOU'RE BONIN'
FINDS OUT ABOUT ALL THIS.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.208
- AND HOW
WOULD THAT HAPPEN?

36:32.667 --> 36:33.625
- I DON'T KNOW.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.417
THINGS GO WRONG
EVERY DAY.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.375
- FUCKIN' MOTHERFUCKER!

36:37.375 --> 36:38.792
- [laughs]

36:38.792 --> 36:41.959
YOU TWO ARE STARTIN'
TO SOUND MORE ALIKE EVERY DAY.

36:41.959 --> 36:43.458
MUST BE LOVE.

36:45.542 --> 36:48.542
- TRAGEDY.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.375
MANY OF US HERE
HAVE EXPERIENCED IT

36:50.375 --> 36:51.709
IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.250
THE KIND THAT LEAVES
YOU WONDERING

36:53.250 --> 36:54.667
IF THERE'S A REASON
TO GO ON LIVING.

36:54.667 --> 36:55.959
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS,

36:55.959 --> 36:57.667
YOU'VE HEARD ME TALKING
ABOUT GETTING IN TOUCH

36:57.667 --> 36:59.166
WITH YOUR PRIMAL SELF.

36:59.166 --> 37:03.250
BUT HOW DOES THE PRIMAL SELF
DEAL WITH LOSS?

37:03.250 --> 37:04.917
Dexter:
COLE'S STARTING HIS ROUNDS.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.041
HE'LL REACH THE SERVICE ELEVATOR
IN FIVE MINUTES.

37:07.041 --> 37:08.583
IN THREE MINUTES, SO WILL I.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.208
- THERE'S SOMEONE
IN THIS ROOM

37:10.208 --> 37:11.959
WHO IS DEALING
WITH THAT VERY QUESTION.

37:11.959 --> 37:16.208
DEXTER MORGAN.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.041
COME AND JOIN ME
ON STAGE, DEXTER.

37:18.041 --> 37:20.041
I KNOW YOU WEREN'T
EXPECTING THIS,

37:20.041 --> 37:21.959
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.

37:21.959 --> 37:23.333
PLEASE.

37:23.333 --> 37:25.709
Dexter: SO MUCH
FOR SLIPPING OUT QUIETLY.

37:25.709 --> 37:26.709
crowd: DEXTER!
- DEXTER.

37:26.709 --> 37:28.583
THEY WANT YOU, DEXTER.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.375
[crowd slowly
chanting "Dexter!"]

37:30.375 --> 37:31.959
- DEXTER. DEXTER.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.792
DEXTER.

37:33.792 --> 37:35.458
DEXTER.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.083
DEXTER.

37:37.083 --> 37:43.375
[cheers and applause]

37:54.709 --> 37:55.875
[elevator bell rings]

37:57.083 --> 37:59.917
DEXTER WORKS
WITH MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

37:59.917 --> 38:02.875
RECENTLY, HE LOST HIS WIFE.

38:02.875 --> 38:04.792
SHE WAS MURDERED...

38:04.792 --> 38:06.083
[crowd gasps]

38:06.083 --> 38:07.750
BY THE TRINITY KILLER.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.667
[shocked muttering]

38:09.667 --> 38:13.375
THE VERY PERSON THAT DEXTER'S
DEPARTMENT WAS HUNTING.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.041
YOU WERE THE ONE
TO FIND HER, YOUR WIFE?

38:15.041 --> 38:16.083
RITA?

38:17.959 --> 38:19.083
- [whispers] YEAH.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.417
YES.

38:20.417 --> 38:22.250
- I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO DO SOMETHING, DEXTER,

38:22.250 --> 38:23.458
AND IT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT.

38:23.458 --> 38:25.583
I WANT YOU TO RELIVE
THAT MOMENT.

38:27.792 --> 38:29.041
ACCORDING
TO THE NEWSPAPERS,

38:29.041 --> 38:31.917
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
GOING AWAY ON HONEYMOON?

38:34.917 --> 38:36.083
DEXTER.

38:37.625 --> 38:39.000
- YE--YES.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.458
- TELL US ABOUT IT.

38:43.333 --> 38:45.083
- WELL, WE POSTPONED
THE HONEYMOON

38:45.083 --> 38:47.709
BECAUSE WE HAD
A NEW BABY, A BOY.

38:47.709 --> 38:49.875
- KEEP GOING.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.709
TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND HER.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.917
PLEASE.

38:58.041 --> 39:01.000
- I'D COME HOME
AFTER WORK.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.417
[on TV monitor] I REMEMBER
WALKING THROUGH THE HOUSE.

39:05.417 --> 39:07.500
I TURNED THE CORNER AND...

39:10.667 --> 39:15.166
IT'S LIKE TIME
ACTUALLY SLOWED DOWN

39:15.166 --> 39:17.291
AND THEN STOPPED.

39:19.291 --> 39:21.792
IT'S JUST A SERIES
OF PICTURES.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.542
- WHAT'D YOU SEE?

39:24.542 --> 39:28.166
- I SAW MY SON
SITTING IN BLOOD.

39:30.333 --> 39:31.959
HE WAS CRYING.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.458
SO MUCH BLOOD.

39:41.041 --> 39:42.959
AND SHE WAS THERE
IN THE TUB.

39:42.959 --> 39:44.625
SHE'D BLED OUT.

39:44.625 --> 39:46.125
HER EYES WERE STILL OPEN.

39:46.125 --> 39:47.709
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
SOMETHING, DEXTER.

39:47.709 --> 39:49.709
I WANT YOU TO BE
VERY HONEST.

39:49.709 --> 39:53.166
WHAT DID YOU FEEL
IN THAT MOMENT?

39:53.166 --> 39:55.166
WE WANT TO KNOW.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.083
- IT'S DIFFICULT
TO PUT INTO WORDS.

40:02.083 --> 40:04.125
EVERYTHING...

40:04.125 --> 40:06.750
FELL APART. I FELT...

40:06.750 --> 40:09.333
- SHATTERED?

40:11.458 --> 40:12.542
- YES.

40:12.542 --> 40:14.375
- WHEN THE PRIMAL SELF
IS SHATTERED,

40:14.375 --> 40:17.000
IT REACHES OUT IN SEARCH OF
WHAT WILL MAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.208
DO YOU FEEL THAT, DEXTER?

40:20.208 --> 40:22.709
THAT HUNGER INSIDE YOU
TO BE WHOLE AGAIN?

40:22.709 --> 40:23.583
- I DO.

40:23.583 --> 40:26.542
- THAT HUNGER
IS YOUR PRIMAL SELF.

40:26.542 --> 40:28.417
YOU MUST OPEN YOUR HEART
AND LISTEN

40:28.417 --> 40:29.709
TO WHAT IT'S SAYING.

40:29.709 --> 40:31.667
MANY PEOPLE
AFTER SUFFERING A TRAGEDY...

40:31.667 --> 40:32.834
- MR. HARMON?

40:32.834 --> 40:35.208
- SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
AS BROKEN BEINGS...

40:35.208 --> 40:36.417
- CAN YOU SIGN THIS, PLEASE?

40:36.417 --> 40:37.583
- LIVING IN THE PAST.
[dialing cell phone]

40:37.583 --> 40:41.417
YOUR PRIMAL SELF
IS CRYING OUT TO BE WHOLE.

40:41.417 --> 40:44.250
WHAT IS IT
THAT WILL MAKE YOU WHOLE?

40:44.250 --> 40:45.667
FOR SOME,
IT'S A NEW JOB.

40:45.667 --> 40:48.166
FOR OTHERS, THE LOVE
OF ANOTHER PERSON.

40:48.166 --> 40:50.542
YOUR PRIMAL SELF
WILL TELL YOU,

40:50.542 --> 40:52.667
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN
TO HEARING THE MESSAGE.

40:52.667 --> 40:53.709
ARE YOU?

40:53.709 --> 40:54.917
- YES.

40:54.917 --> 40:57.375
- THEN YOU'VE JUST TAKEN
YOUR FIRST STEP

40:57.375 --> 40:59.125
TOWARD HAPPINESS.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.500
[cheers and applause]

41:03.500 --> 41:06.583
[cell phone vibrating]

41:10.417 --> 41:12.583
DEXTER.

41:17.041 --> 41:18.500

AAH!

AAH!

42:11.583 --> 42:14.500
[screaming]

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
- YOU FUCKIN' BITCH!

42:16.500 --> 42:19.500
- [gasping]

42:21.834 --> 42:23.667
- [grunting]

42:23.667 --> 42:25.542
[growls]

42:25.542 --> 42:27.000
- NOT THIS TIME.

42:36.542 --> 42:39.834
[smelling salts snap,
Cole sniffs]

42:43.500 --> 42:45.583
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS GAG
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,

42:45.583 --> 42:47.208
BUT IF YOU MAKE ONE SOUND
I DON'T LIKE,

42:47.208 --> 42:48.583
I'M GONNA CUT
YOUR EYES OUT.

42:51.125 --> 42:53.000
BLINK SO I KNOW
YOU UNDERSTAND.

42:58.166 --> 43:00.333
WE KNOW ABOUT BOYD

43:00.333 --> 43:02.375
AND DAN THE DENTIST.

43:02.375 --> 43:05.208
AND NOW YOU.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.667
WHO ARE THE OTHERS?

43:06.667 --> 43:10.917
- THE GUY WHO HELD
A WATCH UP TO MY EAR.

43:10.917 --> 43:13.750
"TICK TICK TICK.

43:13.750 --> 43:16.834
THAT'S THE SOUND
OF YOUR LIFE RUNNING OUT."

43:16.834 --> 43:18.250
- WHAT ARE THERE NAMES?

43:18.250 --> 43:21.667
- [indistinctly whispering]

43:21.667 --> 43:23.083
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

43:27.083 --> 43:28.041
- HUEY,

43:28.041 --> 43:29.417
DEWEY,

43:29.417 --> 43:30.875
AND LOUIE.

43:32.917 --> 43:35.834
- LOOK AT THE WOMEN
WHOSE LIVES YOU DESTROYED.

43:35.834 --> 43:38.166
- [groans]
- LOOK.

43:38.166 --> 43:41.583
- [grunting]

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
- DEATH WAS THE ONLY KINDNESS
YOU SHOWED THEM.

43:54.667 --> 43:57.000
- [groaning]

44:09.417 --> 44:11.625
- IT'S A SHAME
YOU CAN ONLY DIE ONCE.

44:16.041 --> 44:17.917
[Cole grunting]

44:22.542 --> 44:24.000
[groans]

44:42.500 --> 44:45.000
- YOU SAID I'D DONE THIS BEFORE.
THAT'S TRUE.

44:47.291 --> 44:48.875
THIS IS WHO I AM.

44:56.375 --> 44:58.000
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
MY MOTHER WAS MURDERED

44:58.000 --> 44:59.709
IN FRONT OF ME,
AND IT...

45:02.917 --> 45:05.792
SHATTERED ME.

45:08.458 --> 45:10.625
I'VE DONE THIS EVER SINCE.

45:12.792 --> 45:15.208
BECAUSE
FOR THE LONGEST TIME,

45:15.208 --> 45:16.917
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD FEEL...

45:20.417 --> 45:22.166
UNBROKEN.

45:24.709 --> 45:29.166
AND THEN,
RITA WAS KILLED AND

45:29.166 --> 45:30.750
NONE OF THIS
MADE SENSE ANYMORE.

45:38.834 --> 45:40.750
UNTIL NOW.

45:51.333 --> 45:53.375
Dexter:
MIGUEL COULDN'T.

45:53.375 --> 45:54.709
MY FATHER COULDN'T.

45:54.709 --> 45:58.709
CAN ANYONE LIVE WITH THE TRUTH
OF WHAT I AM?

46:14.834 --> 46:14.875

46:34.417 --> 46:36.500
- THE LIEUTENANT SAID
I SHOULD BRING SOME OF MY STUFF

46:36.500 --> 46:37.875
INTO THIS DEPARTMENT.

46:37.875 --> 46:41.458
- IT WAS YOU.

46:41.458 --> 46:43.333
LAGUERTA ASKED YOU
TO BACK HER STORY,

46:43.333 --> 46:44.917
AND OF COURSE YOU DID.

46:47.291 --> 46:48.417
- DEB.

46:50.125 --> 46:51.125
- "DEB"?

46:51.125 --> 46:53.834
- DETECTIVE MORGAN,

46:53.834 --> 46:57.375
YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST WOMAN
IN MIAMI METRO

46:57.375 --> 46:58.458
TO EVER MAKE DETECTIVE,

46:58.458 --> 47:01.583
AND I REALLY ADMIRE YOU,
LIKE, A LOT.

47:01.583 --> 47:04.625
AND I CAME HERE HOPING
TO LEARN FROM YOU.

47:07.834 --> 47:10.542
- WHAT YOU DID

47:10.542 --> 47:12.083
YOU WOULD NEVER
LEARN FROM ME.

47:14.500 --> 47:16.208
GOOD LUCK.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.959
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

47:35.125 --> 47:37.333

I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

47:39.500 --> 47:42.583
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

47:42.583 --> 47:44.375
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BACKING LAGUERTA'S STORY.

47:44.375 --> 47:47.500
- NO, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.

47:47.500 --> 47:50.792
I WAS STUCK
BETWEEN A ROCK AND MY WIFE,

47:50.792 --> 47:53.834
BUT I DECIDED
I'M BACKING YOU.

47:53.834 --> 47:56.000

TOO WELL AT HOME.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.875

48:12.333 --> 48:14.208
- YEAH.

48:14.208 --> 48:15.542
IT'S OKAY.

48:32.375 --> 48:34.542
- MOST PEOPLE WAIT
UNTIL THE SEMINAR IS OVER

48:34.542 --> 48:35.709
BEFORE CHECKING OUT.

48:35.709 --> 48:37.959
- UH, I LOSE
MY NANNY IN AN HOUR.

48:37.959 --> 48:40.542
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO MY SON.

48:40.542 --> 48:41.959
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

48:41.959 --> 48:43.208
- IT'S NOTHING IMPORTANT.

48:43.208 --> 48:45.417
JUST A LITTLE
SECURITY GLITCH.

48:45.417 --> 48:46.875

48:49.917 --> 48:51.917
- I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING ONSTAGE.

48:51.917 --> 48:54.000
- IT DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE I HAD ANY CHOICE.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.166
- I KNOW IT WAS SUDDEN,

48:55.166 --> 48:56.750
AND YOU PROBABLY
DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT,

48:56.750 --> 48:57.875
BUT YOU'LL
LOOK BACK ON IT,

48:57.875 --> 48:59.250
YOU'LL REALIZE
IT WAS WORTH IT.

48:59.250 --> 49:03.417
DON'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENED
HERE THIS WEEKEND, DEXTER.

49:03.417 --> 49:04.625
- I WON'T.

49:04.625 --> 49:06.250
- ACT ON WHAT
YOU'VE LEARNED.

49:06.250 --> 49:07.792
DON'T LET IT SLIP AWAY.

49:07.792 --> 49:09.583
IT'S WHAT I TELL
MY CLIENTS.

49:09.583 --> 49:11.041
TICK TICK TICK?

49:11.041 --> 49:13.291
THAT'S THE SOUND
OF YOUR LIFE RUNNING OUT.

49:13.291 --> 49:15.792
Dexter: MY PRIMAL INSTINCTS
WERE RIGHT.

49:15.792 --> 49:17.125
JORDAN'S ONE OF THEM.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.792

UNTIL THEY COALESCE.

50:00.875 --> 50:02.125
[ticket tears]

50:09.709 --> 50:12.667
AND EVENTS IN THE UNIVERSE
THAT ONCE SEEMED RANDOM

50:12.667 --> 50:16.125
ARE EVENTUALLY REVEALED TO HAVE
AN UNDERLYING CONNECTEDNESS.

50:16.125 --> 50:19.166
- JORDAN CHASE IS ONE OF THEM
I'M SURE OF IT.

50:19.166 --> 50:21.333
"TICK TICK TICK."

50:21.333 --> 50:24.208
- BUT HE WASN'T
IN THE PHOTO.

50:24.208 --> 50:26.625
- MAYBE HE TOOK THE PHOTO,
I DON'T KNOW.

50:28.250 --> 50:30.834
