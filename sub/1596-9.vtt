CONSIDER YOUR SITUATION.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.241
- DON'T YOU TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.452
- OH, DON'T YOU WORRY.
- I'M A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.329
I LIVE IN THIS CITY.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.831
MY PARTNER
WORKS FOR THIS CITY.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.374
BUT BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT MARRIED,

20:08.374 --> 20:11.295
WHICH THE LAW DOESN'T EVEN
ALLOW, I MIGHT ADD,

20:11.295 --> 20:14.130
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE
IN HIS INSURANCE BENEFITS.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.425
WHICH MEANS FOR ME,
IT'S STAND IN THE LINE

20:16.425 --> 20:17.884
AT THE FREE CLINIC OR SUFFER.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.263
THAT'S NOT ONLY UNFAIR
AND UNCHRISTIAN,

20:21.263 --> 20:23.307
IT'S FLAT OUT UN-AMERICAN.

20:23.307 --> 20:24.807
I'M A CITIZEN.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.311
WHERE ARE MY EQUAL RIGHTS?

20:27.311 --> 20:30.605
FIX THAT,
MR. I-WANT-TO-BE-MAYOR.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.234
FUCK.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.319
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.654
I'LL TRANSFER YOU NOW.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.281
[cell phone chimes]

20:40.281 --> 20:42.284
[sighs]

20:46.288 --> 20:47.872
- I LIKE THIS COLOR.

20:47.872 --> 20:52.085
KIND OF CHEERS YOU UP
JUST LOOKING AT IT, RIGHT?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.379
- IT DOES.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.422
- SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU'RE FEELING REALLY BAD,

20:56.422 --> 20:58.341
IF YOU MAKE YOURSELF
LOOK BETTER ON THE OUTSIDE,

20:58.341 --> 21:00.343
IT CAN START TO MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER ON THE INSIDE.

21:00.343 --> 21:03.721
MY MOM CALLS IT,
"TAKING IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IN."

21:03.721 --> 21:05.014
[phone ringing]

21:05.014 --> 21:07.016
[mumbles]

21:11.354 --> 21:15.149
[phone ringing]

21:15.149 --> 21:16.901
JACKSON RESIDENCE.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.278
- DEBBIE, YOU WERE JUST SUPPOSED
TO DROP LIAM THERE.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.863
WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL?
ARE YOU SICK?

21:20.863 --> 21:22.448
- UH, CODE PINK.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.160
- MONICA'S HOME?
- NO, NO, NO.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.870
CODE PINK AT SHEILA'S.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.498
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER, OKAY?
- FINE, EXPLAIN LATER.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.418
BUT YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.420
[sighs]

21:40.466 --> 21:43.345
- WHAT'S A CODE PINK?

21:43.345 --> 21:44.846
- IT'S NOTHING.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.265
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO EXPLAIN TO FIONA

21:47.265 --> 21:48.391
WHY I'M NOT AT SCHOOL.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.185
IT'S LIKE
A CODE WORD WE HAVE.

21:51.185 --> 21:55.356
- OH, NO. WHAT TIME IS IT?

21:55.356 --> 21:57.734
ARE YOU SKIPPING SCHOOL
BECAUSE OF ME?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.944
- I DIDN'T WANT TO GO ANYWAY.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.447
ALL ANYONE EVER DOES
IS TRY TO COPY OFF ME.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.449
BUT NO ONE WANTS
TO SIT WITH ME AT LUNCH.

22:04.449 --> 22:07.536
EVERYBODY'S MEAN.
MIDDLE SCHOOL'S STUPID.

22:07.536 --> 22:10.497
MEAN GIRLS SUCK.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.460
- MY DAUGHTER'S A MEAN GIRL.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.504
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.382
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.428
- BUT I'M HER MOTHER.

22:24.428 --> 22:27.472
- IF HOW WE TURN OUT
IS ALL ABOUT HOW OUR MOTHER IS,

22:27.472 --> 22:30.433
THEN I'M PRETTY SCREWED,
RIGHT?

22:36.440 --> 22:42.446
[both moaning]

22:45.865 --> 22:47.742
- [laughing]

22:47.742 --> 22:50.661
- WHAT'S FUNNY?
- IT'S JUST--

22:50.661 --> 22:52.914
SHE APPLIED TO COLLEGES FOR YOU.

22:52.914 --> 22:55.291
- WOW, I'M SO GLAD MY COCK
THRUST UP INSIDE OF YOU

22:55.291 --> 22:57.794
IS HOLDING YOUR ATTENTION
SO WELL.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.128
THAT'S REALLY NICE FOR ME.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.881
- SORRY, I JUST--
I DON'T GET IT.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.134
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DUMP HER?

23:05.134 --> 23:07.386
- LESS TALKING, MORE RIDING.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.015
[both moaning]

23:16.521 --> 23:19.065
- IS MICKEY SERIOUSLY
GETTING MARRIED?

23:19.065 --> 23:21.442
- YEAH. LIKE,
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.445
- JESUS. TO WHO?

23:23.445 --> 23:25.571
I-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS SEEING ANYONE.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.406
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
HE WAS SEEING HER

23:27.406 --> 23:30.535
SO MUCH AS
HE WAS DOING HER.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.787
- SO WHY'S HE MARRYING HER?
- SHE'S KNOCKED UP.

23:32.787 --> 23:35.081
- SO? I DON'T GET IT.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.499
WHAT, IS YOUR DAD MAKING HIM?

23:36.499 --> 23:37.917
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.502
WHY DO YOU GIVE A SHIT?

23:45.466 --> 23:48.469
[indistinct chatter]

23:57.895 --> 24:00.773
- [sighs]

24:00.773 --> 24:02.775
- DON'T YOU
TURN YOUR BACK ON ME.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.069
I'M A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.988
MY PARTNER
WORKS FOR THIS CITY.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.115
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MARRIED,

24:09.115 --> 24:11.868
WHICH THE LAW DOESN'T EVEN
ALLOW, I MIGHT ADD,

24:11.868 --> 24:14.704
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE
IN HIS INSURANCE BENEFITS,

24:14.704 --> 24:16.914
WHICH MEANS FOR ME,
IT'S STAND IN LINE

24:16.914 --> 24:18.625
AT THE FREE CLINIC OR SUFFER.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.460
THAT'S NOT ONLY UNFAIR
AND UNCHRISTIAN...

24:21.460 --> 24:22.879
- HOLY SHIT.
- IT'S FLAT OUT UN-AMERICAN.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.339
- FRANK?
- YOU KNOW HIM?

24:25.339 --> 24:27.341
- WHERE ARE MY EQUAL RIGHTS?

24:27.341 --> 24:31.095
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.
HE'S MY DAD.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.849
- I--WOW, THAT SPEECH.

24:34.849 --> 24:38.895
YOUR FATHER--I'M SO SORRY.
I AM SO SORRY.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.605
OH, MY GOD, I WISH
I COULD TURN BACK TIME.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.566
- TURN BACK TIME? WHY?

24:42.566 --> 24:44.693
- SOME OF THE OFFICE BITCHES
MAY HAVE NARC-ED ON YOU

24:44.693 --> 24:46.986
ABOUT THE PORN AT YOUR DESK
AND THE PERSONAL PHONE CALLS.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.864
AND BY OFFICE BITCHES,
I MIGHT MEAN MYSELF.

24:49.864 --> 24:52.617
- PORN AT MY DESK?

24:53.910 --> 24:55.786
OH, SHIT.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.371
- FIONA. HI.

24:57.371 --> 24:59.624
SO MR. PRATT IS ASKING
FOR A WORD WITH YOU.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.375
- LET ME GUESS. HE'S THE BOSS?
- NO, NO.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.710
HE'S ONE OF THE COUSINS.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.714
NOT THE BIG BOSS,
BUT HE IS A SUPERVISOR, YES.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.882
- REALLY, VERY SORRY.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.720
[knock at door]
- YES?

25:12.720 --> 25:15.848
- HI. FIONA GALLAGHER.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.391
THE TEMP?

25:17.391 --> 25:19.644
- OH, FIONA, YEAH.

25:19.644 --> 25:22.606
UM, GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.651
GO AHEAD, SORRY.

25:26.651 --> 25:30.696
SO I'VE HAD SOME COMPLAINTS
ABOUT YOUR LANGUAGE,

25:30.696 --> 25:32.741
A FEW PERSONAL CALLS
ON COMPANY TIME--

25:32.741 --> 25:34.116
- I HAVE FIVE KIDS.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.743
THEY'RE MY SIBLINGS,
BUT I RAISE THEM.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.411
AND ONE OF THEM SKIPPED SCHOOL.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.746
SO I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE PERSONAL CALLS,

25:38.746 --> 25:40.582
BUT IT WAS REALLY
ONLY A COUPLE MINUTES.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.832
AND I'M HAPPY TO CLOCK OUT EARLY
AND WORK LATE.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.542
- OH, NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.002
THERE WERE SOME PHOTOS.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.796
- YEAH, THE PORN AT MY DESK?

25:46.796 --> 25:48.422
IT WASN'T REALLY PORN.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.924
IT WAS PICTURES OF PENISES,

25:49.924 --> 25:51.593
BUT IT WAS
FROM A CIRCUMCISION WEBSITE.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.552
SEE, FRIENDS OF MINE
ARE TRYING FOR A BABY.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.429
AND I HAD SAID A THING ABOUT
HOW THEY SHOULD

25:55.429 --> 25:57.473
CIRCUMCISE THE BABY SO THAT
GIRLS WILL BE MORE LIKELY

25:57.473 --> 26:00.768
TO WANT TO--
UH, WITH THEIR MOUTHS.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.561
NOT ON THE BABY, OF COURSE.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.690
I MEAN ONCE HE'S A GROWN-UP.

26:05.690 --> 26:06.983
SHIT.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.859
AM I FIRED?

26:08.859 --> 26:12.113
- NO, YOU'RE--[clears throat]
SORRY.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.740
MY SILENCE HERE IS NOT
SO MUCH ABOUT DISAPPROVAL

26:14.740 --> 26:16.117
AS IT IS TRYING TO FIND A WAY

26:16.117 --> 26:17.618
TO PARTICIPATE
IN THIS CONVERSATION

26:17.618 --> 26:19.621
THAT WON'T LEAVE ME VULNERABLE
TO A LAWSUIT,

26:19.621 --> 26:23.040
'CAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT
I AM A LITTLE SHOCKED

26:23.040 --> 26:27.712
TO LEARN THAT, UM, CIRCUMCISION,
OR A LACK THEREOF,

26:27.712 --> 26:30.799
WOULD AFFECT A WOMAN'S
WILLINGNESS TO--

26:30.799 --> 26:32.174
[clears throat]

26:32.174 --> 26:33.384
I CAN'T SAY THAT.

26:33.384 --> 26:35.804
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING, REALLY.

26:35.804 --> 26:38.556
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY.

26:38.556 --> 26:39.849
I'M SO SORRY.
PLEASE DON'T SUE ME.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.726
- I'M SO SORRY.
PLEASE DON'T FIRE ME.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.770
- DEAL. BUT, HEY,
I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.063
NO MORE NAKED BODY PARTS
AT YOUR DESK FOR ANY REASON.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.690
[both laugh]
- SHIT. SORRY.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.734
- AND WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE,
LIKE YOU'RE IN CHURCH.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.695
- GOT IT.
- AND ALSO,

26:51.695 --> 26:53.070
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.489
- [scoffs] I'M WHAT?

26:55.489 --> 26:56.824
- I GOT A CALL FROM
ONE OF OUR SALES REPS.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.702
YOU APPARENTLY CONVINCED
A HIGH-VOLUME CUSTOMER

26:58.702 --> 27:00.870
THAT WE THOUGHT
WE'D LOST TO RE-UP.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.539
SOMETHING ABOUT
A DELIVERY MAN?

27:03.539 --> 27:05.458
- OH, YEAH. YEAH.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.795
- WELL, ANYWAY, GREAT WORK.
AND KEEP IT UP.

27:12.006 --> 27:14.383
DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T GO OUT THERE SMILING.

27:14.383 --> 27:17.303
YOU'LL HELP ME MAINTAIN
THAT REPUTATION AS A HARD-ASS.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.806
- YOU HAVE A REPUTATION
AS A HARD-ASS?

27:19.806 --> 27:21.182
- NO.

27:21.182 --> 27:22.433
I REALLY WANT ONE, THOUGH.

27:22.433 --> 27:25.478
- [laughs]
- HEY. MM-MM.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.412
- WHAT'S THIS?
- PAYDAY.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.040
- OH, SWEET!

27:46.040 --> 27:48.710
IT'S $218.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.755
I WORKED 40 HOURS
AT $10 AN HOUR.

27:51.755 --> 27:53.672
THAT'S $400.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.049
- YEAH, MINUS TAXES.

27:55.049 --> 27:56.885
OH, AND MINUS
THE FREE REFILLS

27:56.885 --> 27:58.552
YOU'VE BEEN GIVING YOUR
LITTLE BOYFRIEND OVER THERE.

27:58.552 --> 28:01.806
- MY WHAT? NO, THAT'S MY--
I BARELY KNOW HIM.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.390
- HE'S HERE WHEN YOU'RE HERE
AND HE'S NOT WHEN YOU'RE NOT.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.184
AND YOU GIVE HIM FREE REFILLS.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.187
YOU THINK I DON'T SEE?
I SEE.

28:12.817 --> 28:14.861
- PHILLIP?

28:14.861 --> 28:18.781
SCOTT WALKER,
M.I.T. ALUMNI REP.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.699
WE HAD AN APPOINTMENT AT 3:30.
IT'S NEARLY 4:00.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.660
- RIGHT, YEAH. LOOK,
I'M SORRY YOU CAME AND WAITED,

28:22.660 --> 28:24.662
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.790
- YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN M.I.T.?

28:26.790 --> 28:28.875
- NO.
- OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.917
I WAS REALLY CURIOUS
TO INTERVIEW THE KID

28:29.917 --> 28:31.919
WITH THE 4.6 G.P.A.
WHO SO BLATANTLY

28:31.919 --> 28:34.171
PLAGIARIZED
HIS APPLICATION ESSAY.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.133
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HOLD ON.
I DIDN'T PLAGIARIZE ANYTHING.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.520
SHE PLAGIARIZED NELSON MANDELA.
JESUS.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.855
- SHE?

28:50.855 --> 28:53.817
- YEAH, MY GIRLFRIEND
WROTE THIS APPLICATION.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.568
I'M GUESSING SHE GOOGLED
"GOOD SPEECHES" AND

28:55.568 --> 28:57.779
PICKED ONE THAT SOUNDED
SMARTEST TO HER.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.530
I'M SURPRISED SHE DIDN'T
GO WITH "I HAVE A DREAM."

28:59.530 --> 29:01.991
- WELL, YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANT TO DO THE INTERVIEW?

29:01.991 --> 29:03.868
I'M ALREADY HERE.
- NO, THANKS.

29:03.868 --> 29:06.913
I HATE BOSTON. RED SOX SUCK.
- OKAY.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.747
IT'S UNLIKELY YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN IN ANYWAY.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.915
- [laughs]

29:09.915 --> 29:12.459
WHAT IS THAT,
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY?

29:12.459 --> 29:14.295
LET ME GUESS,
YOU MINORED IN PSYCH,

29:14.295 --> 29:17.924
THINKING IT WOULD GIVE YOU A LEG
UP IN BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.842
- YOU MAY HAVE A 4.6,
BUT YOU ALSO REQUIRED

29:19.842 --> 29:22.887
A THREE SEMESTER SENIOR YEAR
DUE TO TRUANCY.

29:22.887 --> 29:25.097
AND COMPETITION IS PRETTY
INTENSE IF YOU REQUIRE

29:25.097 --> 29:28.184
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP,
WHICH I'M GUESSING THAT YOU DO.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.811
- WOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO AHEAD

29:29.811 --> 29:31.520
AND CALL ME WHITE TRASH
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

29:31.520 --> 29:32.813
- COMPETITION'S TOUGHER
AT THIS LEVEL, THAT'S ALL.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.524
- AT THIS LEVEL. JESUS.
GIVE ME A FUCKING PEN.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.114
- FRANK. FRANK, WHY?

29:42.114 --> 29:45.618
WHY WOULD YOU? WHY?
[sighs]

29:47.953 --> 29:49.747
MY COWORKERS
TEASED ME SO MUCH

29:49.747 --> 29:51.415
I HAD TO PRETEND
THAT I WAS SICK.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.042
THEN MY MOTHER CALLED.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.753
SHE ALMOST HAD A CARDIAC EPISODE
SHE WAS SO UPSET.

29:55.753 --> 29:58.422
I ONLY CONVINCED HER LAST YEAR
THAT I'M NOT GAY.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.217
IT TOOK ME YEARS, FRANK,
YEARS.
