02:16.080 --> 02:17.650
What the..

02:18.350 --> 02:20.190
What should we do?
Isn't that Yeong Sook?

02:20.450 --> 02:21.820
Dammit...

02:22.990 --> 02:24.320
Again and again?

02:35.970 --> 02:36.630
What?

02:36.940 --> 02:38.300
You again?

02:38.300 --> 02:39.770
Shorty!

02:40.070 --> 02:41.240
What are you looking at?

02:43.740 --> 02:44.740
Aigoo!

02:44.740 --> 02:45.910
She wasn't like this when little.

02:46.010 --> 02:47.550
More older more delinquent.

02:49.550 --> 02:51.850
Shucks, Look at his face!

02:52.050 --> 02:54.020
This bitch..

03:11.540 --> 03:14.940
Bitch!
You're dead!

03:29.850 --> 03:32.860
<font color="#ffff00">-= Hot Young Blood / Blood Boiling Youth =-</font>

03:53.010 --> 03:54.480
Pervert!

03:55.480 --> 03:56.980
<i>How unlucky!</i>

03:57.820 --> 04:00.620
That girls hand was really big!

04:04.290 --> 04:05.790
<i>Why can't I?</i>

04:09.090 --> 04:11.560
You fools, just..

04:13.030 --> 04:14.330
Put your hands up first,

04:14.400 --> 04:15.630
use the hand's back.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.300
Then?

04:17.640 --> 04:18.769
The girl hits, try it

04:20.570 --> 04:21.910
She can't.

04:21.910 --> 04:22.840
She can't?

04:23.040 --> 04:23.810
But...

04:24.980 --> 04:26.480
She can't move at all.
How?

04:28.610 --> 04:29.610
Turn your hand.

04:32.950 --> 04:34.590
There's still this kind of method.

04:43.690 --> 04:45.360
Let's make a bet!

04:46.230 --> 04:48.030
The loser has to walk till the end
of the train.

04:48.670 --> 04:50.130
Paper, Rock, Scissors!

05:52.030 --> 05:53.360
Show them!

06:22.290 --> 06:25.600
This brat, what are you doing?

06:26.900 --> 06:28.730
Do it right!

06:46.880 --> 06:48.890
Dammit, still goofing around?

06:49.820 --> 06:50.790
What are you doing?

06:50.790 --> 06:51.790
The eggplant fell.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.490
The eggplant fell?

06:53.520 --> 06:54.760
Do it right!

07:05.800 --> 07:07.970
Why does she run everyday?

07:08.010 --> 07:09.140
In this hot weather.

07:10.610 --> 07:13.240
Do you guys know Hang Tae Kyo
from the third grade?

07:13.950 --> 07:15.310
We know.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.320
A few days ago that brat
went to the brothel,

07:18.480 --> 07:20.520
and was arrested, did you know?

07:22.790 --> 07:23.750
You think it's funny?

07:24.660 --> 07:25.960
Tell him to do his hair!

07:25.960 --> 07:27.120
It's messed up.

07:29.790 --> 07:32.800
There's nothing as hair style
freedom.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.970
This brat...

07:36.130 --> 07:39.640
cut your hair, understand?

07:41.810 --> 07:44.480
Today is about sex education.

07:46.580 --> 07:48.310
<i>Look at your happy faces.</i>

07:48.780 --> 07:52.120
This is an article I cut off
from the newspaper.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.920
A professor from Russia once said,

07:57.050 --> 07:58.520
A man till he dies,

07:59.360 --> 08:01.060
can do it around 4000 times.

08:02.530 --> 08:03.490
In other words,

08:03.660 --> 08:05.830
doing it about 4000 times.

08:10.170 --> 08:12.840
Of course there's a possibillity of
"can't do"

08:12.840 --> 08:13.640
Understand?

08:15.140 --> 08:18.580
Also, eventhough using hands,

08:18.580 --> 08:20.040
it still counts.

08:20.310 --> 08:21.710
Understand?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.350
Kang Choong Gil!

08:25.850 --> 08:27.320
Brat, what are you doing?

08:28.490 --> 08:30.550
You're the most suspicious one,
you know?

08:30.720 --> 08:32.559
Don't tell me you're already 4000 times?

08:37.900 --> 08:38.730
It's fake!

08:41.730 --> 08:43.230
Have you seen it?

08:45.200 --> 08:48.940
Don't watch movies or read books
that can lead you emotionally.

08:50.780 --> 08:54.840
The door has to be open.
This is important.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.530
Which means we have to be cautios of..

09:09.960 --> 09:11.960
men's genital.

09:50.430 --> 09:52.270
-=6 o 'clock, Hotel=-

09:54.440 --> 09:55.770
What did he write?

09:55.770 --> 09:56.770
It's nothing.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.440
An invitation, eh?

10:00.610 --> 10:02.780
You have to be careful around him.

10:03.610 --> 10:04.280
Why?

10:04.280 --> 10:05.620
Girls that go out with him,

10:05.950 --> 10:07.920
not only one or two that
has been fooled.

10:07.920 --> 10:08.750
Right?

10:09.250 --> 10:10.090
Fooled?

10:11.590 --> 10:13.260
Although you have a strong defence,

10:13.760 --> 10:16.090
you'll be helpless in front of him.

10:20.260 --> 10:21.400
You're going?

10:21.530 --> 10:23.200
Am I crazy?!

10:33.540 --> 10:35.050
I'm not a n easy girl.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.680
I know.

10:41.690 --> 10:44.350
When you were on the first grade
at class 3-3, number 27,

10:44.520 --> 10:45.860
Fourth sit from the window.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.160
Your face tells me that you were
thinking about something.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.660
Looking outside...

10:55.330 --> 10:57.500
Since I first saw you,

10:57.940 --> 11:00.500
I think about you three times a day.

11:00.940 --> 11:02.510
Is it brushing your teeth?

11:06.010 --> 11:07.810
Why are you looking at me that way?

11:10.180 --> 11:11.650
Because you're pretty.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.480
I can't stand it if my eyes
don't see you.

11:15.490 --> 11:17.320
What's pretty about me?

11:18.150 --> 11:20.320
There's way more girl's
prettier than me.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.660
I always feel...

11:22.990 --> 11:25.330
that inside everyone,
there's always something beautiful.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Beautiful because elegant...

11:28.770 --> 11:31.430
Beautiful because plump...

11:32.300 --> 11:33.970
Beautiful because smart.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.770
Someone that has the most whitest elbow,

11:38.780 --> 11:40.240
there's no one but you.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.920
What's wrong?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.390
My head feels dizzy.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.070
Wah, who's this?

12:14.380 --> 12:15.710
Stand up properly!

12:19.050 --> 12:21.220
I already told you,
don't show in front of me.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.020
Brat!

12:24.020 --> 12:24.990
<i>Oppa!</i>

12:25.120 --> 12:26.760
Yeong Sook asked you to go up.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.300
Have a good meal!

12:43.970 --> 12:45.810
Why do you still bother him?

12:46.110 --> 12:47.440
Don't you know?

12:47.780 --> 12:51.450
After my sister broke up with him,
she hasn't came home for six months .

12:52.920 --> 12:54.750
Isn't she looking for money to do
plastic surgery?

12:55.920 --> 12:56.720
That...

12:56.850 --> 12:58.120
It's because I feel embarrased,

12:58.220 --> 12:59.420
The noodles is going soft.

13:08.930 --> 13:10.000
You're still here?

13:10.670 --> 13:12.670
I was worried if something happened.

13:13.670 --> 13:16.670
That hyung likes to look after me.

13:16.670 --> 13:17.840
We're good friends.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.680
C'mon!

13:19.680 --> 13:21.010
Where are we going?

14:33.280 --> 14:34.750
Clean up.

14:40.590 --> 14:41.760
You're home?

15:09.620 --> 15:11.620
<i>We need some sleep too.</i>

15:12.620 --> 15:14.760
<i>Oppa, aren't you going home?</i>

16:10.450 --> 16:11.950
<i>Is there anybody home?</i>

16:15.750 --> 16:16.850
<i>Has it come?</i>

16:16.850 --> 16:17.990
<i>How are you?</i>

16:18.320 --> 16:19.820
<i>What did you bring?</i>

16:20.160 --> 16:21.620
<i>There's no need for you to.</i>

16:21.960 --> 16:22.790
Back then...

16:23.460 --> 16:24.460
Choong Gil's dad,

16:24.460 --> 16:26.730
helped watering our family's farm.

16:26.730 --> 16:27.930
It must've been exhausting.

16:29.730 --> 16:30.570
So I brought some fruits,

16:30.700 --> 16:31.700
for you to eat together.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.370
It grew nicely.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.910
If you need some physical work,
call me.

16:42.310 --> 16:43.880
There's no men in your house.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.220
I haven't seen you wear those hair pin..

16:51.720 --> 16:52.220
I'll...

16:52.690 --> 16:53.860
...take my leave then.

16:54.020 --> 16:54.860
<i>Okay.</i>

16:55.860 --> 16:57.030
<i>I'll visit another time.</i>

17:17.210 --> 17:18.680
I'm very handsome.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.849
<i>Hyung, you're here!</i>

17:19.849 --> 17:21.050
<i>Has it arrived?</i>

17:26.319 --> 17:27.490
Th--th--that's mine!

17:34.330 --> 17:35.460
It's my package.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.370
Have breakfast before you go!

17:39.470 --> 17:40.670
I'm okay!

17:40.670 --> 17:42.470
At least have some breakfast!

17:42.470 --> 17:44.340
Forget it,
there's no need to bother him.

17:52.110 --> 17:52.610
Choong Gil...

17:52.950 --> 17:56.080
Uncle is now in Brazil
which is in another hemisphere.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.920
This place feels like heaven.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.090
Reading with no emotions.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.220
I have to sail too after graduation.

18:02.390 --> 18:02.890
You promised.

18:03.230 --> 18:05.390
You said you'll bring me along.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.400
There's big news!

18:10.900 --> 18:11.830
There's a transfer from Seoul.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.370
Compared to Jeong Yoon and Yoo Jin,

18:13.670 --> 18:14.500
this one's more beautiful.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.040
Really?

19:24.810 --> 19:25.640
Eonnie is here!

19:29.310 --> 19:29.810
Eonnie!

19:29.810 --> 19:30.710
How are you?

19:46.900 --> 19:48.060
Yeong Sook is looking for you.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.500
Follow me!

19:59.440 --> 20:00.810
Why? Why? Why?

20:00.810 --> 20:02.440
What is it Yeong Sook? Why?

20:10.320 --> 20:12.720
They say you're good at seducing girls.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.530
The girl that went with you,
was invited to your "base".

20:23.570 --> 20:24.370
But...

20:24.700 --> 20:25.530
why..

20:26.300 --> 20:27.800
aren't you seducing me?

20:35.140 --> 20:36.710
Let's meet,
at you base,

20:37.280 --> 20:38.450
8 o 'clock.

20:50.390 --> 20:51.560
What did she say?

20:52.460 --> 20:54.160
She said to meet at the base.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.700
Are you going?

21:40.840 --> 21:42.110
What?

21:42.240 --> 21:42.810
That...

21:43.810 --> 21:46.480
Choong Gil had an emergency.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.180
He told me to send this message.

21:58.860 --> 21:59.330
Wait!

22:14.480 --> 22:15.140
Yeong Sook, why?

22:16.310 --> 22:18.980
This fuck!

22:20.980 --> 22:22.320
How dare you...

22:23.990 --> 22:25.650
Fuck!

22:36.930 --> 22:38.930
Why can't it be me?

22:49.810 --> 22:52.250
Blood...

23:07.630 --> 23:09.330
That...

23:09.500 --> 23:10.430
the transfer...

23:11.130 --> 23:12.930
help me check her out!

23:15.240 --> 23:17.710
Worry about your grades first!

23:18.540 --> 23:19.870
This brat.

23:20.210 --> 23:22.210
<i>Follow me!</i>

23:22.210 --> 23:23.510
<i>Hold it!</i>

23:26.480 --> 23:27.950
Look at your face trying to fake.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.280
Look!

23:29.280 --> 23:30.080
You still dare to fake sick?

23:30.080 --> 23:30.920
My tail bone!

23:31.750 --> 23:32.590
This brat.

23:32.590 --> 23:34.090
You deliberately got zero, didn't you?

23:36.560 --> 23:37.730
Yes.

23:38.230 --> 23:38.660
I did.

23:38.660 --> 23:39.660
What?

23:40.400 --> 23:41.130
This...

23:41.660 --> 23:43.630
Actually, on the regime of Japan,
my grandfather,

23:43.900 --> 23:46.470
was caught by the Japanese because of his 
Independent acts,

23:47.800 --> 23:49.800
and was tortured till death.

23:52.110 --> 23:53.540
That time he said,,

23:53.910 --> 23:56.410
Until we die,
we have to hate the Japanese.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.380
After saying that, he died.

24:00.150 --> 24:02.720
Me, as his grandchild,
how can I write Japanese?

24:04.950 --> 24:06.450
Hold!

24:07.460 --> 24:08.420
Hold, you brat!

24:10.390 --> 24:12.330
Then your grandmother is an anti America?

24:18.970 --> 24:21.140
Why did you lie.

24:21.640 --> 24:22.600
<i>It hurts!</i>

24:25.110 --> 24:26.440
That...

24:27.040 --> 24:29.080
She was born here.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.210
She moved to Seoul because of school.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.550
<i>His father is a factory owner.</i>

24:35.920 --> 24:36.850
Then why did she move back?

24:37.520 --> 24:38.550
<i>I heard because of sickness.</i>

24:39.020 --> 24:39.720
Where?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.090
Lungs.

24:41.690 --> 24:42.890
So Hee? (sounds like rain).

24:42.920 --> 24:44.090
Is it raining?

24:44.330 --> 24:45.830
It's still sunshine.

24:56.170 --> 24:57.000
Hei!

24:57.940 --> 24:59.340
Give it to me.

25:05.010 --> 25:06.350
Where do you want me to out it?

25:06.910 --> 25:08.180
Here?

25:14.420 --> 25:16.190
Don't you know this is the Nonggo territory?

25:16.820 --> 25:18.760
What are you doing here?

25:20.460 --> 25:21.400
Fuck.

25:22.330 --> 25:23.900
You want to start a fight me?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.580
Why? Afraid ain't ya..

25:44.320 --> 25:45.220
Interesting.

25:57.430 --> 25:58.130
Lost.

26:01.040 --> 26:01.740
Are you okay?

26:02.740 --> 26:04.370
I didn't lose.

26:15.650 --> 26:17.120
Yeong Sook...

26:24.290 --> 26:25.730
Why didn't you show up yesterday?

26:26.560 --> 26:29.060
We're both people going on different paths.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.560
What?

26:32.230 --> 26:33.900
Aren't you Gwang Sik's..

26:34.570 --> 26:35.740
Says who?

26:36.040 --> 26:39.210
He and me are only allies.

26:40.340 --> 26:43.080
You didn't come because you're
affraid of Gwang Sik?

26:44.310 --> 26:45.150
Yeong Sook...

26:45.750 --> 26:47.980
What's happening between us,
is not love..

26:48.820 --> 26:49.980
but a threat.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.320
What?

26:57.490 --> 26:59.360
Look, look,
you wanted to punch me, right?

26:59.360 --> 27:00.330
<i>Hei!</i>

27:00.990 --> 27:02.160
Kang Choong Gil!

27:11.740 --> 27:12.970
How are you?

27:13.310 --> 27:15.640
What are you doing with my Yeong Sook?

27:16.510 --> 27:18.150
We weren't doing anything.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.820
If you're done, let's go!

27:27.250 --> 27:28.490
Be careful.

Sir, I...

28:02.590 --> 28:03.590
<i>Go!</i>

29:12.890 --> 29:15.900
-=Don't want to love you in selfishness. Choong Gil.
Meet me at 6=-

29:47.730 --> 29:48.860
What the?

29:48.860 --> 29:50.430
There's still plenty of seats outside.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.140
Are you waiting for So Hee?

29:56.740 --> 29:57.800
She won't come.

30:00.970 --> 30:01.680
She said so?

30:01.680 --> 30:02.980
She won't come?

30:05.910 --> 30:07.110
Speak up!

30:07.180 --> 30:08.280
Did she say why?

30:15.960 --> 30:17.620
What part of her that you like?

30:21.130 --> 30:22.130
Her beauty.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.700
Your hair...

30:34.370 --> 30:36.710
Why did you have to eat 
my jjajangmyeon?

30:50.020 --> 30:51.990
Is she from the sports department?

30:52.730 --> 30:55.160
We don't have any sports department.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.300
Then why does she keep running around the field?

30:58.530 --> 31:00.470
Maybe she was chosen for marathon.

31:01.970 --> 31:02.440
Choong Gil,

31:02.570 --> 31:03.240
What do you think?

31:06.040 --> 31:07.370
He likes her cousin oppa,

31:07.770 --> 31:09.380
But that's not allowed,

31:10.210 --> 31:12.380
That's why, to hide her feelings,
she runs everyday.

31:14.050 --> 31:14.880
Crazy girl.

31:20.190 --> 31:21.750
You're awesome.

31:26.530 --> 31:29.530
Isn't that So Hee?

31:58.490 --> 32:00.290
Were you busy last night?

32:05.330 --> 32:07.600
Hei, you forgot something.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.090
What are you doing?

32:28.090 --> 32:28.720
Moping.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.560
Can't you see?

32:31.220 --> 32:32.330
Because the first son is coming,

32:32.490 --> 32:33.760
everything is being cleaned.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.670
Even the dog is the same.

32:40.830 --> 32:42.170
What?

32:50.110 --> 32:50.780
Don't make sound while eating.

32:50.810 --> 32:52.580
Didn't your mother taught you?!

32:52.810 --> 32:54.480
My mother makes sound too.

32:55.820 --> 32:56.450
Brat.

33:04.690 --> 33:07.460
Passing his father and doesn't even greet.

33:08.490 --> 33:09.960
You're spoiling him too much!

33:10.000 --> 33:11.630
That's why he became such thing.

33:11.660 --> 33:12.770
Making him--

33:12.770 --> 33:13.900
Aren't you going?

33:13.900 --> 33:14.900
If you're done, go home!

33:18.370 --> 33:19.610
Quickly go!

33:25.880 --> 33:27.310
You write it.

33:28.780 --> 33:30.750
Why did she came here?

33:32.520 --> 33:35.020
Maybe she's out of her mind?

34:01.510 --> 34:02.850
On this chance,

34:03.520 --> 34:06.690
we invite Teacher Lee Jong Pal and
Teacher Kim Na Yeong,

34:06.690 --> 34:07.750
to sing a song for us.

34:07.820 --> 34:08.250
That brat!

34:51.429 --> 34:56.770
<i>Kiss!</i>

34:56.770 --> 34:58.500
Next one!

35:04.740 --> 35:06.040
Don't yell, ya brats!

35:09.980 --> 35:11.150
Transfer student from Seoul

35:11.150 --> 35:12.480
SMA Hongseong-nong

35:12.550 --> 35:13.490
the new mascot...

35:14.090 --> 35:15.820
new angel...

35:16.820 --> 35:17.290
Who is it?

35:17.590 --> 35:20.590
Choi So Hee!

35:20.490 --> 35:21.590
Get up!

35:22.260 --> 35:23.100
Sing!

35:25.130 --> 35:28.700
Applause!

36:17.050 --> 36:24.290
Park Yeong Sook!

36:25.390 --> 36:27.360
Park Yeong Sook!

36:27.360 --> 36:28.360
Don't do it.

37:03.300 --> 37:06.500
<i>Stop it! Enough! Enough!</i>

37:07.400 --> 37:10.700
Everyone finish here and get back, understand?!

37:19.040 --> 37:20.980
<i>Because our attorney is home.</i>

37:25.020 --> 37:27.450
Son, try this.

37:31.260 --> 37:32.620
<i>Let me.</i>

37:34.090 --> 37:35.390
Look at this memory of mine.

37:35.660 --> 37:36.900
Aigoo, Mister Attorney...

37:36.900 --> 37:39.400
Let's have a toast!

37:40.400 --> 37:41.800
Toast, what toast?

37:41.930 --> 37:43.440
He just got here, must've been tired.

37:44.270 --> 37:46.100
After you finish, take some rest!

37:46.400 --> 37:46.910
Okay.

37:49.410 --> 37:50.380
I'll go in first.

37:50.340 --> 37:52.480
Yeah.
Go in and take some rest!

37:52.780 --> 37:54.180
You told an attorney to drink?

37:55.310 --> 37:57.450
Are bragging now?

37:57.820 --> 37:59.420
Can't stand your attitude.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.420
Then go home!

38:34.050 --> 38:34.790
Aigoo...

38:34.750 --> 38:36.120
What a crowd.

38:49.270 --> 38:50.270
Let's go!

38:59.640 --> 39:00.880
What are you doing here,

39:03.120 --> 39:05.380
This is your your hyung's party,
What are you doing here?

39:07.890 --> 39:09.520
I just took a rest for a bit.

39:09.620 --> 39:10.520
A bit?

39:12.090 --> 39:13.660
Don't go to school at Saturday.

39:13.830 --> 39:14.830
Why?

39:14.960 --> 39:16.130
What why?

39:16.460 --> 39:17.900
Help me work!

39:19.600 --> 39:20.900
Isn't hyung at home?

39:21.800 --> 39:23.900
You think I'm some kind of maid?

39:25.570 --> 39:28.070
You don't even go to school to study.

39:28.740 --> 39:30.240
Everday chasing girls.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.410
Don't you see yourself?

39:32.480 --> 39:35.910
Just mind your own business!
Why get in other people's.

39:40.090 --> 39:44.090
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

39:49.590 --> 39:51.100
You are, aren't you?

40:16.350 --> 40:17.420
It's a misunderstanding.

40:18.020 --> 40:19.420
I was reading a book.

40:21.590 --> 40:23.590
What does Choong Gil like?

40:34.440 --> 40:35.610
I need to write some.

40:36.610 --> 40:38.010
Should I write a hundred?

40:47.750 --> 40:49.420
Isn't this the new model?

40:51.960 --> 40:52.720
Hei!

40:52.790 --> 40:53.830
What is this?

40:53.930 --> 40:54.990
You know whose this is?

40:55.660 --> 40:56.660
How should I?

40:58.500 --> 40:59.630
Is it Yeong Sook?

40:59.630 --> 41:00.230
This brat...

41:02.570 --> 41:04.070
It's not..

41:04.640 --> 41:06.070
supposed to.

41:11.210 --> 41:12.410
Where are you going?

41:21.290 --> 41:22.350
Is this you?

41:24.860 --> 41:25.620
Why?

41:25.620 --> 41:27.460
You don't like it?
Then give it back.

41:34.770 --> 41:36.670
Just this one time!

44:56.470 --> 44:58.500
Isn't that So Hee?

45:06.080 --> 45:07.810
What is it?

45:08.980 --> 45:12.420
- Where? Where?
- Here, Here.

45:15.590 --> 45:16.750
Isn't this a leech?

45:25.200 --> 45:26.700
It could be dangerous if 
the poison spreads.

45:28.270 --> 45:29.930
What are you doing?

45:32.740 --> 45:33.570
<i>Don't move!</i>

45:38.740 --> 45:39.910
That bitch!

45:41.750 --> 45:43.080
He finally sucks it.

45:43.980 --> 45:45.050
<i>This brat!</i>

45:47.820 --> 45:49.190
<i>How could there be poison!</i>

45:49.850 --> 45:52.120
You're smart at looking for chances

45:52.120 --> 45:54.120
Follow me! Follow me!

45:54.290 --> 45:55.790
Don't make any excuses!

45:57.460 --> 45:59.300
Nothing serious.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.530
Head class!

46:00.530 --> 46:02.700
Take her to the clinic!

46:50.880 --> 46:53.520
Get on, c'mon!

46:54.820 --> 46:56.620
It's hard to find transportation here.

49:46.560 --> 49:47.960
Why did you bring in your shoes?

49:47.960 --> 49:49.130
It stinks.

49:49.790 --> 49:51.460
You said to not let other people see.

49:51.630 --> 49:53.130
What's done is done.

49:58.940 --> 49:59.600
Everytime always...

50:04.270 --> 50:05.270
Food.

50:06.940 --> 50:08.610
How can there be banchan everyday?

50:09.550 --> 50:10.550
With a teacher's salary.

50:10.850 --> 50:12.010
What did I say?

50:12.010 --> 50:12.680
Enjoy it first.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.860
Today Choong Gil..

50:19.990 --> 50:21.490
was really bold.

50:22.160 --> 50:23.830
Doing things he want.

50:25.660 --> 50:27.660
Not like someone.

50:29.300 --> 50:30.670
What bold?

50:30.970 --> 50:32.340
That brat..

50:32.440 --> 50:35.000
I think that brat was cool.

50:36.010 --> 50:37.410
Was it that cool?

50:39.080 --> 50:40.240
I'm just saying..

50:41.040 --> 50:42.710
We are even afraid to be seen,

50:43.250 --> 50:45.050
We even have to keep our distance.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.380
Because the student's are watching..

50:48.050 --> 50:49.720
So what if the student's are watching?

50:50.390 --> 50:52.190
Then let's end this relationship!

50:54.690 --> 50:56.190
What's wrong, so suddenly?

50:58.630 --> 50:59.530
Then, starting now..

51:00.630 --> 51:02.500
I'll also be honest

51:06.770 --> 51:08.270
Try it, then!

51:13.040 --> 51:14.240
Okay.

51:20.350 --> 51:21.180
When are you..

51:29.090 --> 51:30.790
It's a little hot.

51:31.260 --> 51:33.200
The door needs to be open a little.

51:35.060 --> 51:36.630
You can't even stand that?

51:41.700 --> 51:43.770
What is?

51:44.040 --> 51:47.210
It doesn't even smell.

51:49.650 --> 51:54.380
Teacher Lee Jong Pal really has the skill
to piss people off.

51:56.350 --> 51:57.720
Things like this...

52:00.160 --> 52:01.060
Try it!

52:06.560 --> 52:07.730
I'm going.

52:18.740 --> 52:19.910
Don't move!

52:49.610 --> 52:50.870
Why did you come so early?

52:51.040 --> 52:52.370
Miss me already?

52:59.850 --> 53:01.420
What is this?

53:01.480 --> 53:03.890
I didn't have the time to thank you
that day.

53:04.820 --> 53:05.690
A present.

53:06.760 --> 53:08.490
Things so trivial like that..

53:11.090 --> 53:12.290
Handkerchief?

53:12.800 --> 53:13.800
It's not.

53:14.630 --> 53:16.300
Handkerchief is a farewell present.

53:17.000 --> 53:17.900
Oh yeah?

53:23.910 --> 53:27.080
So cool!

53:28.580 --> 53:30.080
It's a trend item in Seoul.

53:30.080 --> 53:32.080
Every handsome men have this.

53:33.550 --> 53:34.520
Thank you.

53:38.050 --> 53:39.190
As a return,

53:39.420 --> 53:41.390
How about i treat you some jjajangmyeon?
There's a...

53:41.490 --> 53:42.830
I've just eaten.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.100
Then the movies...

53:52.070 --> 53:53.900
When you were in Seoul,
what did you used to do?

53:54.700 --> 53:56.840
Once in a while doing rollerskate..

53:58.010 --> 53:59.170
Rollerskate..

53:59.840 --> 54:01.380
There's no rink around here..

54:01.440 --> 54:02.640
Everything is hard ground.

54:06.620 --> 54:08.720
How could there be no rink in here?

54:09.020 --> 54:10.390
It's all around!

54:12.350 --> 54:15.060
As long as there's a slippery floor.

54:19.330 --> 54:21.030
This is a sliperry place..

54:21.200 --> 54:22.530
Play till your fullest!

55:09.380 --> 55:10.450
Are you okay?

55:17.120 --> 55:19.320
It must've hurt, here!

55:35.900 --> 55:37.110
Do you want to eat?

55:43.910 --> 55:45.380
You like motorcycle?

55:45.950 --> 55:47.220
It'll look a little delinquent..

55:47.850 --> 55:49.990
But it would be more refreshing, right?

55:50.490 --> 55:51.420
Do you want me to?

55:51.820 --> 55:52.820
Seriously?

55:52.820 --> 55:53.820
You know how to ride?

55:55.290 --> 55:56.490
Who am I?

55:56.830 --> 55:58.160
I am Kang Choong Gil.

55:58.390 --> 56:00.660
This is nothing,
just get on!

56:45.510 --> 56:46.680
C'mon!

56:51.210 --> 56:52.580
Now I understand.

56:53.080 --> 56:53.780
About?

56:55.750 --> 56:56.820
Yeong Sook.

56:59.650 --> 57:02.220
That girl needs an environment.

57:02.890 --> 57:04.060
What a pity.

57:06.060 --> 57:07.900
That's because she has a high solidarity.

57:10.400 --> 57:12.400
I heard she likes you.

57:13.640 --> 57:16.200
Don't say something so scary.

57:16.870 --> 57:18.210
Someone's making that up.

57:20.410 --> 57:21.810
Add some anchovies!

57:27.950 --> 57:28.950
What are you doing?

57:29.020 --> 57:30.150
Put it in!

57:36.930 --> 57:38.830
Are you deaf?

57:39.330 --> 57:40.330
Quickly put it in!

57:42.700 --> 57:44.000
Quick!

57:45.170 --> 57:47.170
It won't open!

57:47.270 --> 57:49.170
I told you it won't open!

57:50.310 --> 57:51.270
What's with her?

58:12.260 --> 58:13.660
Because you're beautiful.

58:23.470 --> 58:24.640
Let me!

58:26.140 --> 58:27.080
Don't move.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.480
Eat a lot.

58:34.820 --> 58:35.650
Thanks.

58:48.830 --> 58:49.460
Love is,

58:50.130 --> 58:51.530
getting close to each other.

58:54.070 --> 58:55.140
Let's eat!

58:58.470 --> 58:59.470
So pretty.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.040
Should we go now?

59:31.640 --> 59:33.340
Why are you in a hurry?

59:33.780 --> 59:35.180
Take it easy for a while.

59:37.680 --> 59:41.950
You have the skill to make guys go crazy.

59:51.130 --> 59:51.960
What is this?

59:56.100 --> 01:00:01.440
Since when... I...
Honestly...

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.070
I'm going home.

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:08.710
Wait!

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.040
Did you think I'm an easy girl?

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.650
It's not like that.

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:13.150
That's not what I did.

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.220
You were like that from
the beginning.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.750
No, you have to listen to me!

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.570
Pervert!

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.100
You really have no shame.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.670
I thought you were sincere even if
it was just for a moment.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.150
Also, the pants you're wearing...

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480
is really tacky!

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.580
Bring your food.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.210
Forget it.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.080
I've got no appetite.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.250
Since when did you eat because
you had an appetite?!

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.080
Bring it with you!

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.920
Today is the day to sell
the cow.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.240
What? Crazy.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:41.760
Isn't it time to show some progress?

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:45.760
Hey!

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:48.600
Is it because another man?

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.600
If there is?

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:52.270
Watch out.

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:54.470
There's a possibility he's dead.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.110
You should be more cautios.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.540
If you you continue to be like this,
you could've die in vain.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.020
Shit!

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.080
You dropped something.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.080
Thanks.

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:48.220
Don't you have asthma?
And you still smoke?

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:58.670
Omo! How could this be here?
Is it my dad's?

01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:03.840
So you're good on acting.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.190
Let's talk outside for a moment.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:27.630
This bitch...

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:28.760
It's okay.

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:41.270
Bitch, you've got some guts!

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:46.780
You guys wait outside.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.620
I hope you would pretend you
didn't see it.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.460
What?

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.290
You know.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.270
I want to stay here.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.430
You are going to help me.

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:09.100
Me?

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.440
Why should I?

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.110
Fuck.

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.580
What did you say?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.510
Wait a minute.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.490
What are you doing?

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:35.500
Fuck!

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.530
Hey! Jeong Sook is beating So Hee
in the rest room!

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.210
Ya, let's not use any weapons.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.210
Fine.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:03.520
Let go!

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.890
You even stripped her?

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.070
Move!

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.920
Sorry, I'm late.

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:06.220
Mister Principle.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.520
Thank you.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.690
Did you get back home safely
that day?

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.090
That day, drinking was...

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.760
Please have a seat.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.229
You know about the situation, right?

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.899
Because the girls are fighting,
you became troubled.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:26.870
It's not because of the fight.

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:28.370
In my 33 years of teaching,

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.380
it's my first time seeing a girl bringing
this kind of thing.

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.120
This thing can be a weapon.

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:42.149
Are you showing off that you're a daughter
of a cartographer?

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:44.920
Pal Poong oppa!

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:47.560
What did you just say?

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.600
Are you done talking? Aigoo...

01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:54.529
Did you forget the times when you brought
a bag of shit home?

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:58.770
You've got some money,
and you became more arrogant.

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:00.410
Becoming inhuman.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.410
What?

01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:07.010
What did you just say?

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.310
Did words just came out of your mouth?

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:09.319
You widow!

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.620
W--what? Widow?

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.290
Yeah, a widow!

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.189
Yes, I'm a widow... widow.

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:19.630
So? So what do you want!
You beggar!

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:23.930
Fuck! Enough!

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:26.100
What? A cartographer's daughter is
something to be proud of?

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.939
This fucked up school
Just drop me out!

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.510
<i>Yeong Sook! Yeong Sook!</i>

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.180
Park Yeong Sook, what are you doing?

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:46.689
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.990
<i>Park Yeong Sook!</i>

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.500

<i>Why are you crying?</i>

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:58.120
<i>Did you forget something?</i>

01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:04.800
<i>Let's see, what we have to prepare for today..</i>

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:08.570
<i>Colored papers, scissors, compass.
Which one?</i>

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:10.540
<i>Forget it.</i>

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.810
<i>Compass, eh?</i>

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.950
<i>Why?</i>

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:27.620
<i>I still have one.</i>

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:29.820
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.470
-=Students that didn't bring their equipments,
Kang Choong Gil=-

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.010
Choong Gil came and brought this.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.350
I heard you made a ruckus today.

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.120
It hasn't been long since you
came back...

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:36.250
and you're already making trouble?

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.890
<i>Mom! Eonnie is relapsing.</i>

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.230
-=Drugstore=-

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.200
Where have you been?

01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:52.370
Helping my father.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:55.370
Yeong Sook is at our base now.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.840
What's she doing there?

01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:00.480
Don't you dare go there!

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.580
My feeling tells me there's
something going.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.380
I've got to help my father.
I'm going!

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:07.420
Don't you go there!

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.320
Don't go!

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.520
<i>Not there!</i>

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.490
Be careful!

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:27.570
Are you okay?

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:28.940
No need to worry me.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:36.180
Why? Choi Gwang Sik beat you?

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.780
How many times did he hit you?

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.280
Forget it! Let go!

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:43.260
That bastard's flying hands at girls?

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.590
It's not like you would help me get revenge.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.740
I can stay here for now,
right?

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.310
Going home is just...

01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:05.540
No problem.

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.220
Then what do you want to do?

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:18.090
I'm still thinking.

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:23.830
We are going to graduate soon.

01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:27.470
Forget it!
I don't want to go to college.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.970
You don't want to go to college?

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.810
Didn't you have good grades when little?

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.440
That time, how could there be a bad grade?

01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:41.780
Me, I had bad grades that time.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.250
I used to copy your homework.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.090
You were so smart, I bet you could chase them.

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:57.000
Forget it.
Only you think about this.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.460
I'm serious.

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:08.310
Go back home!

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:13.950
Do you want spend the night
with me here?

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:18.220
Don't say nonsense!

01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:23.720
I'm going home.
Take some rest!

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.690
Be careful!

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.830
Yeah.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.120
Wait!

01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:04.390
Listen to my explanation!

01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:05.220
Move!

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.740
Where are you going?

01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:35.590
I'm asking where are you going?

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.490
Where I'm going doesn't have anything
to do with you.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.760
You just met that bastard Choong Gil, eh?

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:45.700
Move! I'm tired.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.670
What did you two just do?

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:52.940
Fuck!

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.410
What did you do?

01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:00.850
Yeah, just done something.

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:02.450
So what?

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.850
Hyung, let's drink a cup!

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:38.850
This kid is really alcoholic.

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.160
Is that a pants or skirt?

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:48.160
It's suitable for work.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.830
This pants can be windy.
How is it?

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.170
It's not bad.
Where did you buy it?

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.270
Dunno. Found it at home.
Why?

01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:59.600
I want to buy one too.

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.050
Did he eat something wrong again?

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:17.720
Guys his age are all like that.

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:53.590
Choong Gil, big problem!
The kids from Gong-go high are coming here!

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.020
Hey, Gwang Sik...
Throughout histo...

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.330
Hey, Gwang Sik...
Throughout history,

You guys has never step foot on our school.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.670
What are you doing here?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.340
Are you trying to break the rule, asshole?

01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:43.470
Enough! Hand Kang Choong Gil over!

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.110
I'll go without any word.

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:49.950
Choong Gil is from our school.
Of course I can't hand him over.

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.020
He touched my girl.

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.990
As a man,
Shouldn't you take responsibility?

01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:58.120
Choong Gil, is that right?

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.290
Of--of course not.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.690
Fuck you!

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.860
What? Because of him, you want to fight?
Is that it?

01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:06.860
This bunch of fucks...

01:21:06.930 --> 01:21:08.470
Why? You want to try a round?

01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:10.800
Fine, c'mon then!

01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:12.130
You want some fight?

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.070
<i>I saw it myself!</i>

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.550
Let's go!

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.570
Sorry for troubling you.

01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:44.740
We're going.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.340
It's gonna be alright.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.050
Hurry c'mon over!

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:03.890
That... Choong Gil is...

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.600
Fuck!

01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:25.610
Yeong Sook...

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.610
Why are you coming here?

01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:31.580
What are you doing?

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.580
You can't see it?

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.390
After harrassing you,
shouldn't he pay for his mistakes?

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.060
What are you talking about?
You bastard!

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.390
I told you I didn't do anything--

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:44.730
Go!

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.460
Quickly!

01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:52.800
Where are you running to? Stay there!

01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:58.640
You know what this is, right?

01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:03.450
If you get one step closer,
I'll flush it to you!

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:16.160
If you want to, go ahead.
I'm going first.

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.320
Do you still remember this?

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.160
When we were in elementary school,
I didn't bring a compass..

01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:21.320
so you gave it to me.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.160
Yeah, I remember.

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.030
Why did you do it, back then?

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:37.210
Because I still have one.
So I gave it to you.

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.580
Yeah?

01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:45.380
I'm sorry for what happened today.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.650
There won't be any in the future.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.390
You can go back alone, right?

01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:52.390
I'm going first.

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:57.560
Hey, Yeong Sook!

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:03.570
Why do you like me?

01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:05.370
What's the reason?

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:12.240
The reason came after I liked you.

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:20.080
Me too... my heart used to beat for you.

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:25.260
But my dad likes to hang out at your house.

01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:28.760
I thought he had something with your mother,
that's why I gave up.

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:31.900
Yeah?

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.900
Even that wasn't an obstacle for me.

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:39.740
What did you say?

01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:46.180
I said, you were right to give up!

01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:16.870
It's already charred!

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.220
<i>I'm home!</i>

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.830
<i>Choong Gil...</i>

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.570
<i>your dad has came back.</i>

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:44.570
<i>What did you say?</i>

01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:48.470
<i>After 8 years being outside,
your father's finally home.</i>

01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:52.140
<i>Also, after this...</i>

01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:55.310
<i>your mother won't be back home.</i>

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:56.650
<i>What did you say, Grandma?</i>

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:04.250
<i>Poor kid.
You still got grandma.</i>

01:27:13.230 --> 01:27:14.400
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.830
<i>It's Choong Gil.</i>

01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:20.600
<i>Choong Gil, my baby,
Let's go!</i>

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.410
<i>Choong Gil!</i>

01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:31.780
<i>Go away!</i>

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:09.290
What's wrong?

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.740
Aren't you Choong Gil girlfriend?

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.410
He touched my girlfriend.

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.820
I want to collect the same debt.

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.590
It doesn't feel good to have a debt.

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:51.830
What kind of movie I thought..

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.330
If the students watch,
it could be a problem.

01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:18.650
Did you hear that sound?

01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:19.820
No.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:32.800
Did you hear that? Let's take a look!
Let's go!

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.150
See you again.

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.120
Hey! Who are you guys?
What are you doing?

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.060
Aren't you going to stop..

01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:28.690
What happened?

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.030
You still like me?

01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:37.300
Yeah..

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.970
Then, you have to kill
that bastard Gwang Sik.

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.190
What the? A cutter?

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.130
You came to kill me?

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.460
Then what are you waiting for?

01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:18.300
Stab me!

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.610
From now...

01:32:30.710 --> 01:32:32.580
count from to 1 to 50.

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.520
Start.

01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:37.320
One...

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:42.590
Go on!

01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:45.960
Two...

01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:51.400
Three...

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:04.210
Look at his face.
Seems like beaten up.

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:12.690
Fuck!

01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:35.740
Hey, Cho Gwang Sik!
Did you really harrased So Hee?

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:38.580
Why? I can't?

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.750
Of course not,
she's my girl!

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:46.120
Hah! This bastard.
So what?

01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:04.110
Crazy asshole.
How can you do it in one or two days.

01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:13.080
-=Hongseong - K.A. Seoul ticket=-

01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:18.690
<i>Long time no see.</i>

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.000
That bastard came looking for me yesterday.

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:33.000
Wanted to kill me, he says.
Even brought a cutter.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.040
I bothered that transfer from Seoul.

01:34:38.110 --> 01:34:40.940
My life motto is,
Don't live a life with any debts.

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:44.180
You came to tell me this rubbish?

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.480
Go back home.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.320
For me, it's all in the past.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.150
Oh yeah?
Then I'll just have to kill him.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.290
Hey!
What is it that you want?

01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:04.500
If it's going to be like this,
let's just end this.

01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:07.000
Because of that bastard,
you're giving in?

01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:15.510
<i>If I say so, would you forget all this?</i>

01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:26.920
Last question, even for a moment...

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:31.590
did you never even liked me?

01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:36.730
Yeah, never.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.210
Alright.

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:02.420
You were right.

01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:06.090
You and me are now allies.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.740
So many came.

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:25.550
Let's finish this quickly.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:36.920
Cho Gwang Sik!

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:49.400
Get out!

01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:55.740
Kang Choong Gil, I can't touch you.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.080
It's better if you go.

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.850
As long as I don't touch So Hee, right?

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.520
Yeah..

01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:11.360
I got it, go.

01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:27.170
Anyway, your sister ran away
wasn't because of me.

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:44.190
What time is it?

01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:47.630
If you want to do what you want, just get out of here.
Why do you bother going home?

01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.940
What's this? You didn't even turn the lights.

01:38:00.170 --> 01:38:01.480
Get out!

01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:03.610
What have you been doing
these days?

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.580
Get up!

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.020
What's wrong with your face?

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.890
You used to chase girls all day long,
and now you're into fighting?

01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:19.560
<i>Well done!
Do you think you're that cool?</i>

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.230
You'll turn into a thug like this, ya know?

01:38:25.130 --> 01:38:27.700
This bastard! What good is hanging your
mother's photo?

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.910
You exposed my room?
Why do you expose other's room all you like?

01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:40.780
What right do you have to scold me?

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.580
A dog passing by would even laugh.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.020
What did you say?

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.520
Did I say wrong?

01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:50.190
Because you were never home,
mom ran out of home.

01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:56.200
You should be the one apologizing.

01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:58.370
This punk!

01:39:01.670 --> 01:39:03.370
Why are you standing by?

01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:06.740
Hit me! Hit me more!

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.080
Just beat me till I die!

01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.820
Crazy bastard, what do you think
you're doing?

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.120
Are you nuts?

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.960
You still think mom ran away because of dad?

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.970
<i>Mom ran away because she cheated.</i>

01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:35.170
<i>Dad lied to you, because he's afraid you'll get hurt!</i>

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.100
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:42.080
<i>If you don't believe it, check the wardrobe at the house.</i>

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:44.310
<i>How dad went through his life.</i>

01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:47.580
What is this?
Choong Gil!

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:07.300
I already threw it,
why is it hang up again?

01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.600
Aigoo, so evil!

01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:16.640
<i>Give it back, mom!
Don't touch it!</i>

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.690
<i>Why are you so stupid!
Why are you so stubborn?</i>

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:46.940
<i>Mom!</i>

01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:54.480
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.050
<i>Your son! Your son!</i>

01:40:56.450 --> 01:41:03.320
<i>Aigoo, my son!
Why didn't you say anything first?</i>

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:08.930
<i>I'm home.</i>

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.300
<i>Where's the children's mother?</i>

01:41:13.325 --> 01:41:15.325
<i>- Ha?
- The childrens mother.</i>

01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:17.350
<i>- Oh, that...
- Why?</i>

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.770
<i>Let's get in first!</i>

01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:21.040
<i>Why?</i>

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:27.580
<i>My poor son...</i>

01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:31.180
<i>Why, mom? Mom! Mom!
What happened?</i>

01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:39.850
Hello!

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.210
What happened to your face?

01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:06.080
Yeah, you don't even want to go
back home.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.850
Forget it! Don't let So Hee,
make you ruin your own life.

01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:12.850
Don't mess up with Gwang Sik!

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.390
Even if you reincarnate,
you're still not his oppenent.

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:23.800
Choong Gil, Yeong Sook she...

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:32.240
<i>Yeong Sook is not that weak.</i>

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:38.710
Yeah, but she didn't even fight back.

01:43:39.110 --> 01:43:40.180
<i>Why is that?</i>

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.980
<i>I'm still thinking whether to 
tell you or not..</i>

01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:46.820
<i>What is it?</i>

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:52.260
Yeong Sook she... for protecting Choong Gil,
willingly got beaten.

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:54.590
What are you talking about?

01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:22.650
What? What is it?

01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:29.130
Open your eyes!

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.430
She didn't even blink.

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:40.140
What does she like from you to make her
step down from her throne.

01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:46.280
Take a dump!

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:53.250
<i>Kang Choong Gil, I can't touch you!</i>

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:54.920
<i>It's better if you go.</i>

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.760
<i>Yeong Sook she... for protecting Choong Gil,
willingly got beaten.</i>

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.240
Fuck!

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:28.280
Choong Gil!

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:32.050
Do think I'll let go or not?

01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:36.820
Just let go, you fuck!

01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:53.870
Choong Gil!

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.170
Yeong Sook!

01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:59.640
She already went to Seoul.

01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:32.970
<i>Choong Gil, it's not that I'm
running away...</i>

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.810
<i>That day when we were talking abour our past,
I realized..</i>

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:46.650
<i>Except for you, I've never wanted
to be anything.</i>

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:53.760
<i>So eventhough I just started,
I want to find it...</i>

01:48:55.690 --> 01:49:02.570
<i>Because of that,
you have to realize your dreams too.</i>

01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:06.740
<i>Don't just say that you want to sail.</i>

01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:09.340
<i>Use these books and study hard.</i>

01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:17.050
<i>You can do it,
I really believe it.</i>

01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:20.220
<i>You got it?</i>

01:50:23.150 --> 01:50:25.350
You've seen the blackboard is written
31 October, right?

01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:26.650
Yes!

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.290
That day, at 12:30...

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:33.660
I'm going to get married.

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.070
You punks that have time should come
and eat some noodles. You got it?

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:09.660
-=Don't want to love you with any selfishness.
Meet me at 6. So Hee.=-

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:12.830
What's this, are you going?

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.540
Are you going?

01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:27.680
Let's eat some deokkbokki!

01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:55.370
I haven't ordered yet, there's a guy...

01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.240
<i>It was ordered by that guy.</i>

01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:00.280
Ordered by Kang Choong Gil.

01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:03.780
He couldn't come,
so you can finish and go back home.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:43.620
I'm home!

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.460
How many years has it been?

01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:50.660
<i>Three years.</i>

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.360
Uncle!

01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:56.530
Choong Gil!

01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:02.510
Why did you just come home?

01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:08.180
Wait a minute, this is your aunt to-be.

01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:10.180
How are you!

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.650
What the?

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.160
Where did all your hair go?

01:53:58.030 --> 01:54:01.700
Family appeal.
Soon it'll be your turn.

01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:08.170
Dammit! So many dissapointments.

01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:12.010
You can't tell a women by her looks,

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.010
but also her heart.

01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:16.080
Understand my heart.

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.860
In my life,
I have been to many places.

01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:28.560
I've seen many beautiful women.

01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:31.230
The only women whom I want to live
the rest of my life with is..

01:54:31.530 --> 01:54:34.200
only her alone.

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:40.070
I give the rest of my life to her.

01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:41.540
Forget it!

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:45.480
You still want to sail?

01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:54.420
If you want to just say it!
I can help you.

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:03.730
Nah, there's something I need to do.

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.400
What are you doing here and leaving
your wife there?

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.760
What? People are watching.
