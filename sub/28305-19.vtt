WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:04.221
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends. Where to start?

00:04.265 --> 00:06.658
With the accidental
insemination?

00:06.702 --> 00:08.356
With the love story?

00:08.399 --> 00:10.010
With the heartbreak?

00:10.053 --> 00:11.359
PETRA:
J.R. broke up with me.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.013
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
With the friendship...

00:13.056 --> 00:15.058
I'll just ask one
of my sisters for an egg.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.668
I don't want to complicate
our friendship.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.976
With the marriages...

00:20.020 --> 00:21.325
With the family...

00:21.369 --> 00:23.762
With the career high...

00:23.806 --> 00:24.807
The auction's over.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.200
$500,000.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.984
You did it, Jane.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.768
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
With the three women...

00:29.812 --> 00:32.554
At the end of the day,
those three women.

00:32.597 --> 00:35.383
Yes, friends,
let's start there.

00:35.426 --> 00:38.212
Since that's where
our story began...

00:40.214 --> 00:44.131
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was a much younger girl,

00:44.174 --> 00:46.176
she had to face
the unthinkable...

00:46.220 --> 00:48.178
What do you mean
the telenovela's gonna end?

00:48.222 --> 00:51.138
Well, they just revealed
the last big secret.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.965
So the show's
almost over.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.793
Forever?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.360
But Lina watches
Days of our Lives

00:56.404 --> 00:59.624
with her family,
and they're on season 34.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.120
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, friends,

01:17.164 --> 01:20.123
our Jane never loved endings.

01:20.167 --> 01:23.909
And yet, here she was,
facing a doozy.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.912
I just don't think
I can say goodbye.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.044
To the couch?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.828
It was our first
big purchase together.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.656
How can we just
get rid of it?

01:31.700 --> 01:33.484
Just think how happy it'll make
someone who didn't

01:33.528 --> 01:36.183
just sign a massive book deal.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.881
Come on. You said you wanted
to splurge on something.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.970
And I will, just not
a $5,000 couch

01:41.013 --> 01:42.276
Mateo's gonna
jump all over.

01:43.668 --> 01:44.756
Hey, guys...

01:44.800 --> 01:46.149
Can you please

01:46.193 --> 01:47.237
tell her that she has
to buy something

01:47.281 --> 01:48.760
with her book advance?

01:48.804 --> 01:51.285
Tell him I'm going to after
I finish the first round

01:51.328 --> 01:52.590
of notes from my editor.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.462
I just want to make sure
that they like it, since

01:54.505 --> 01:56.420
they're paying...Say it.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.335
...half a
million dollars!

02:01.425 --> 02:04.298
Who-- what, are you
guys over it already?

02:04.341 --> 02:08.084
Actually, we wanted
to have lunch today

02:08.128 --> 02:09.172
to tell you something.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.653
Okay.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.572
We're... moving
to New York.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.313
What?

02:19.356 --> 02:20.966
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So, yeah.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.881
That's the doozy
I was talking about.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.535
ROGELIO: This Is Marswill be filming there.

02:24.579 --> 02:27.059
So your mother
graciously offered

02:27.103 --> 02:28.583
to transfer nursing schools.

02:28.626 --> 02:31.107
We didn't want to say anything
unless we could convince

02:31.151 --> 02:32.978
Darci and Esteban to move.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.242
Your father didn't want to
miss out on Baby's childhood.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.461
Not that I want to miss out
on your adulthood.

02:37.505 --> 02:41.291
But, uh, New York
is just a short flight away.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.684
I get it.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.207
Of course.

02:45.426 --> 02:49.212
So when are you moving?

02:49.256 --> 02:50.779
Three days
after the wedding.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.650
Wow. Okay.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.217
Well, it's a good thing

02:54.261 --> 02:57.351
that we're not going on
a honeymoon right away.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.832
I'm gonna miss you.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.662
Me, too. So much.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.797
Oh! I can't believe

03:08.840 --> 03:11.147
we won't be in the same city.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.496
Oh...

03:14.324 --> 03:16.718
Oh, no, but...
this is good.

03:16.761 --> 03:17.719
This is exciting.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.764
If you say so.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.341
Okay, uh, so, we
still have a month.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.734
What do we do?

03:32.777 --> 03:34.605
Just live our lives.
You have to finish

03:34.649 --> 03:36.477
editing your book.Exactly.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.002
And I'll take the lead
on wedding planning.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.177
You okay?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.397
I just feel like I'm
already losing time.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.400
It does go quickly, friends,

03:46.443 --> 03:48.315
as you well know.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.539
Ah... so that's it.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.150
My book is officially finished.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.414
My editor loves
the new ending.
And you?

04:00.457 --> 04:02.677
I'm, like, 98 and a half
percent there.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.418
But I have accepted

04:04.461 --> 04:05.810
I'll never get
to a hundred.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.464
Too much anxiety.
The point is,

04:07.508 --> 04:10.162
I've typed "the end," and I'm
on track for a summer release.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.686
Badass.

04:11.729 --> 04:14.471
Does that mean we can
upgrade to a plated dinner?

04:14.515 --> 04:16.473
For $26 a head? No way.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.475
My abuela'schurch friends can
make their way to the buffet.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.824
They've done it before.
But...

04:19.868 --> 04:21.652
I'm ready to talk
all things wedding.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.437
: All right.
Let's do this.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.265
God, I love seeing you
with that checklist.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.309
What a turn-on.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.485
Why, thank you. Okay.

04:28.529 --> 04:29.704
The caterer has
our deposit.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.314
The cake is confirmed
and so is the DJ.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.881
I e-mailed all the
vendors and the guests

04:32.924 --> 04:34.535
to remind them that the
marathon is this weekend,

04:34.578 --> 04:35.449
so traffic will be crazy.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.972
Look at you talking all dirty.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.147
Lina has confirmed

04:38.190 --> 04:40.410
that the wedding dress
is in transit.

04:40.454 --> 04:43.108
And, ah. Now onto
some open questions.

04:43.152 --> 04:46.242
Hit me with them open questions.Are we...

04:46.286 --> 04:48.244
sleeping together or apart
the night before the wedding?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.420
Together. Definitely.Agreed.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.595
And I finished my vows.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.205
Mm.First time I've
ever finished

04:53.249 --> 04:54.250
a writing assignment on time.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.339
First time I haven't.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.340
B-Because of my book.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.429
Don't worry, I got this.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.518
I'm not worried.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.346
But there is one more
thing we have to do.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.565
What?

05:05.609 --> 05:07.611
Practice our dance.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.660
♪ Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

05:13.661 --> 05:14.836
♪ Mm, mm, mm, mm...

05:14.879 --> 05:16.359
PETRA:
Ew. Way too sweet.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.230
I don't want hearts
on the place cards.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.884
We're not in third grade.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.582
Are you sure
you don't want to invite

05:21.625 --> 05:23.366
any more people
to the rehearsal dinner?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.237
Hmm? Jane won't have
to spend a dime

05:25.281 --> 05:26.587
of that book money--
it's my treat.

05:26.630 --> 05:29.067
Nah. We want to
keep it small.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.374
But if youwant to
bring a plus-one...

05:31.418 --> 05:33.637
Please. That's just not
what I'm about right now.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.639
I am happily married
to the Marbella.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.383
Now let's talk schedule.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.298
Cocktail hour will be from 5:00
to 6:00, followed by dinner.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.386
During dinner,
we'll do the toasts.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.692
And yes,

05:44.735 --> 05:46.911
I will be making one.Oh, yeah?

05:46.955 --> 05:49.914
Yes. And it's going to be
really funny.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.829
JANE:
But Petra's not funny.

05:51.873 --> 05:54.005
I know. But she was so excited,
so just laugh

05:54.049 --> 05:55.877
whenever she pauses.I will.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.182
Unless she
publicly fires someone.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.402
How was the dress fitting?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.882
Amazing. Lina crushed it.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.274
I'm so happy.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.885
Oh, I can't wait
to see you in it.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.104
Oh. Love you.
See you at home.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.715
Jane?Hmm?

06:07.758 --> 06:09.891
Hey. I got your e-mail,
and yes, we would love

06:09.934 --> 06:11.936
for you to marry our spirits--
though we are thinking

06:11.980 --> 06:13.590
it's more of an
after-ceremony
private thing.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.244
Great. Um, but I was

06:15.287 --> 06:17.420
actually hoping to talk to you
about something else.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.900
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh. That's never good.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.597
Of course. Sure.
What is it?

06:20.641 --> 06:22.947
I found Rafael's birth parents.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.907
Yes, friends,
looks like that last secret

06:25.950 --> 06:27.735
will finally be revealed.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.872
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: As you can imagine-- or I can--

06:34.916 --> 06:38.136
there are so many ways
a story can end.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.224
You found Rafael's parents?

06:39.268 --> 06:40.443
Endings can be dramatic.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.531
Are they crime lords?

06:41.575 --> 06:42.880
Or shocking.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.273
Rose isn't his
mother, is she?

06:44.316 --> 06:46.101
Or seemingly mundane.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.277
His parents were just...

06:48.320 --> 06:50.366
regular people.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.934
Were?

06:52.977 --> 06:55.240
They're dead. Which, of course,

06:55.284 --> 06:57.286
is a different kind
of ending altogether.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.461
Oh, no.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.115
Here's everything

07:00.158 --> 07:02.683
I could find out about them.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.206
I thought...

07:04.249 --> 07:07.078
you should be the one
to tell Rafael.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.003
If I'm cold, I'll go shopping.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.179
I hear there are stores
in New York.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.150
Hey. Where's Mateo? I have
to get home to talk to Rafael.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.935
Upstairs. He said he's working
on some big surprise for me.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.374
Wha...?

07:42.418 --> 07:44.420
Mateo, what did you do?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.422
I unpacked you,
so now you don't have to move.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.556
Looks like Jane's son
doesn't like goodbyes, either.

07:49.599 --> 07:52.950
Mateo, sweetie,
Abuela still has to move.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.125
Why?

07:54.169 --> 07:55.736
You know why.
Because of Papa's show.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.041
That's why Papa

07:57.085 --> 08:00.523
has to move, but Abuela
could stay here with us.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.483
No, I can't, sweetie.Yes, you can.

08:03.526 --> 08:04.614
You just don't want to.

08:04.658 --> 08:05.963
That's not true.You could

08:06.007 --> 08:07.182
if you wanted to.
JANE:
It'll be okay, Mateo.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.314
It's just like we talked about.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.534
Okay? We'll FaceTime
every night.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.493
It's not the same.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.669
It's just not.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.933
Yeah, I know
how you feel, buddy.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.763
Hey.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.548
What took you
guys so long?We had a little issue,

08:25.592 --> 08:27.550
but we're doing better.
Right, Mr. Sweetface?

08:27.594 --> 08:30.292
Can I sleep in bed
with you guys tonight?

08:30.335 --> 08:32.555
No fair! If he gets
to, then we do, too.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.471
Yeah. And no tooting,
Mateo.It's not tooting

08:35.515 --> 08:37.952
if I do it
in my sleep.Uh, yes, it is.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.084
It's still tooting.Official ruling is...

08:40.128 --> 08:42.478
it's tooting!Yeah!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.480
RAFAEL: Hey, and try not to do
it in your sleep tonight, huh?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.569
So, what do you say?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.571
Family sleepover?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.487
Okay, let's do it.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.752
ROGELIO:
Thank you.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.972
You are an excellent agent,
Barry.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.582
Okay.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.411
The network just dropped
the This Is Marspilot online

09:02.454 --> 09:06.241
to generate some buzz
before it officially
starts airing in the fall.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.416
Wow.I just can't believe

09:07.459 --> 09:08.678
it's finally being released

09:08.722 --> 09:10.201
to American audiences.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.463
People are watching it
right now.

09:11.507 --> 09:12.595
Do you think there's buzz yet?

09:12.639 --> 09:14.597
Probably not.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.295
Xo...

09:17.339 --> 09:18.819
it's happening.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.385
#Mars is already trending.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.953
America loves me!

09:25.129 --> 09:27.697
Oh. Apparently,
America loves NASA.

09:27.741 --> 09:30.221
They just landed
another rover on Mars.

09:30.265 --> 09:33.485
Oh, I'll just help you repack
to take my mind off it.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.096
But, I mean,
it's exciting, no?

09:35.139 --> 09:37.054
Lots of big changes ahead.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.889
Luisa found my parents?

09:45.933 --> 09:48.326
Yes. And I don't know
how to tell you this

09:48.370 --> 09:50.285
except to just tell you.

09:50.328 --> 09:53.331
They died
in a car accident.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.683
Oh.I am so sorry.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.293
They lived in Italy.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.903
They owned a bakery.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.514
It's all in there.A bakery.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.518
Wow.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.477
How normal.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.348
I-I guess I was expecting
something, um...

10:10.392 --> 10:12.350
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Straight out of a telenovela?

10:12.394 --> 10:14.396
...bigger.

10:14.439 --> 10:15.876
Crazier.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.181
Like I said.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.401
I know it's a terrible
time to find out,

10:19.444 --> 10:20.489
right before the wedding.

10:20.532 --> 10:21.925
No.

10:23.405 --> 10:26.103
Actually, it's
the perfect time.

10:26.147 --> 10:29.324
I think a few months ago I
would have been devastated.

10:29.367 --> 10:32.370
But all I can think
about right now is...

10:32.414 --> 10:34.590
how much I dohave.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.202
I mean, I am literally
surrounded by family.

10:38.246 --> 10:41.466
So how can I feel
anything but gratitude?

10:41.510 --> 10:42.467
Oh...

10:43.817 --> 10:45.688
NARRATOR :
It's like Chekhov's gun.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.168
Had to go off!

10:48.473 --> 10:49.997
Oh.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.129
I can't wait to marry you.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.522
Which brings us to...

10:53.565 --> 10:56.090
♪ Da, da, da, da...

10:56.133 --> 10:57.352
Jane, walk faster.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.570
Girls, get back here.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.442
Mateo, why are your pants off?

11:00.485 --> 11:01.704
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Luckily, just the rehearsal.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.577
Because this is
the third run-through, Abuela.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.275
LILIANA:
Never fear,

11:07.318 --> 11:09.451
I am here.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.409
Hello, Mother.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.194
Oh. Come here, my beautiful boy.

11:13.237 --> 11:16.806
I have missed you
so much, mwah!

11:16.850 --> 11:19.069
I'm gonna do
a reading at the wedding.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.985
Oh, then you have
to practice projection,

11:22.029 --> 11:23.595
so they can hear you
from the cheap seats.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.076
Hello, darling.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.516
Hi.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.389
So, have you written
your vows yet?

11:34.432 --> 11:37.000
Tonight. Oh.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.307
Oh, my God.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.525
The publisher is printing

11:40.569 --> 11:42.266
advanced galleys
of my book this week.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.485
They're sending them
to authors to review.

11:43.528 --> 11:46.009
What?!That's amazing.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.402
But wait, that's not
even the best part.

11:47.445 --> 11:50.666
One of the authors
is Isabel Allende.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.494
Isabel Allende might write

11:52.537 --> 11:54.104
a blurb for the back of my book!

11:56.890 --> 11:58.282
Oh, Lina, are you okay?

11:59.544 --> 12:00.894
Yes. I'm sorry. I'm fine.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.460
Mm-hmm. Go on.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.593
Isabel Something. Yay!

12:04.636 --> 12:06.638
Mm...

12:06.682 --> 12:09.424
Okay, I was gonna wait
until after the wedding

12:09.467 --> 12:11.513
to tell you, but...

12:11.556 --> 12:15.212
I'm pregnant.Oh, my God. Congratulations.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.258
Oh...

12:17.301 --> 12:18.476
Which sister gave you an egg?

12:18.520 --> 12:20.391
The pretty one, clearly.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.524
Alexis?Jackie.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.613
That's what I meant. I just,
I mix them up all the time.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.006
I am so happy for you,

12:26.049 --> 12:28.399
oh, and your very lucky baby.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.227
Okay, enough.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.403
I'm supposed to be
gushing about you.

12:34.449 --> 12:37.104
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which, for the record, she did.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.367
People think I grew up
with four sisters...

12:41.195 --> 12:44.024
...but the truth is,
I grew up with five.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.548
And I only liked one of them.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.420
Jane, you are...

12:49.464 --> 12:51.248
...everything to me.

12:51.292 --> 12:55.209
The person I look up to
the most in this world,

12:55.252 --> 12:58.603
the person I want to be
when I grow up.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.215
And the one thing
I know...

13:01.258 --> 13:05.610
...is that, uh,
becoming Jane's father

13:05.654 --> 13:08.265
late in life,

13:08.309 --> 13:11.442
has been...

13:11.486 --> 13:14.750
well, the greatest joy
of my life.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.058
It's true. And, uh,

13:18.101 --> 13:21.235
tomorrow, I'm so thrilled
to be gaining a son.

13:21.278 --> 13:25.239
So, Rafael,

13:25.282 --> 13:28.329
I would be honored
if you call me Dad.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.336
U-Uh... Thank you.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.339
Thank you...?

13:41.124 --> 13:42.865
Very much.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.302
PETRA:
Well, you'll
sort that out.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.261
So,

13:47.304 --> 13:49.176
anyway, there's been a lot
of tears shed here tonight,

13:49.219 --> 13:51.352
so I think it's time
for some laughs.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.704
I always knew Jane
was super into weddings,

13:55.747 --> 13:58.228
because she was always marrying
the ketchups at work.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.144
And Rafael, well,
he's always been...

14:01.188 --> 14:05.061
Well, his shirts are so tight,

14:05.105 --> 14:07.585
and his pants...

14:07.629 --> 14:09.761
It's okay, Petra.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.981
You don't have to be funny.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.287
No, I wrote these jokes
so I wouldn't

14:13.330 --> 14:14.766
get emotional like this.

14:14.810 --> 14:18.161
Eh, I don't think it's working.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.424
I just love you two so much.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.253
Your love is something
I aspire to.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.954
And I wish you
all the happiness in the world,

14:27.997 --> 14:29.390
which is a really
weird feeling,

14:29.433 --> 14:31.609
because I don't usually wish
happiness on other people.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.092
I love you.I love you.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.227
Ah...

14:40.270 --> 14:43.534
Thank you so much, everyone.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.407
: We are just...

14:46.450 --> 14:49.453
I also want to make a toast.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.629
Uh-oh.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.069
Jane,
a long time ago,

14:56.112 --> 14:59.072
I was going through
a rough time,

14:59.115 --> 15:02.989
and I accidentally
inseminated you.

15:03.032 --> 15:08.385
So I just want to take
this moment to say...

15:08.429 --> 15:10.387
you're welcome.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.523
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Suffice it to say,

15:15.566 --> 15:18.004
on that night, there was love.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.967
So much in fact, that suddenly
Jane realized something.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.623
Mm. You have
that look.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.930
You want to go write?Quickly. Is that okay?

15:30.973 --> 15:33.019
Of course. Go.Okay.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.498
Ugh.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.722
So...

15:40.765 --> 15:43.507
you seemed a little
choked up about love.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.380
Oh, please. Villanueva events
are madefor people to cry.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.990
It's just how
they're constructed.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.427
It's fine. I'm fine.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.429
Where did Jane run off to?

15:52.473 --> 15:55.345
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, there she is.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.347
Wow.

15:57.391 --> 15:59.523
Somebody was inspired
by those speeches.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.830
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone

16:01.873 --> 16:04.528
that my wife, the writer,
plagiarized her vows.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.228
Oh, I wasn't writing my vows.

16:08.271 --> 16:11.448
I, uh... I-I just suddenly got
an idea for the end of my book

16:11.492 --> 16:13.450
that would get
me close to 100%,

16:13.494 --> 16:16.105
and I e-mailed my editor to
see if she could get the file

16:16.149 --> 16:19.326
into the printing press in time
to get it to Isabel Allende.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.458
Got it.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.982
I was gonna write my
vows later tonight.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.505
Well, you know
what they say.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.724
It's always best
when you just slip 'em in

16:26.768 --> 16:29.075
right under the deadline.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.469
We should get back inside.
Dessert's coming.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.907
ROGELIO: I definitely ate too much cake.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.606
Yeah. Me, too.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.523
You're upset,
and I get it.

16:42.566 --> 16:45.178
I put Rafael on the spot,
but it came from a good place.

16:45.221 --> 16:46.701
Rogelio, it's not that.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.442
I need to tell you something.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.621
I don't think
I could move to New York.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.064
Wh-What do you mean,
you can't move to New York?

17:02.108 --> 17:05.067
I just don't want
to leave my whole family.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.938
And I've been trying
to push that feeling aside

17:06.982 --> 17:10.116
and support you, but...
I really don't think

17:10.159 --> 17:11.639
it's the right move for me.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.162
I mean, I just started

17:13.206 --> 17:15.164
getting into the groove
with my nursing program.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.253
My life finally feels
like it's on track.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.386
So? So wha-what are you saying?

17:19.429 --> 17:20.909
Because I have to go.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.519
I signed a contract.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.261
Well, I was thinking,

17:25.305 --> 17:27.263
maybe we should commute.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.309
Just for this year.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.093
I'll live here
during the week,

17:31.137 --> 17:33.617
and we'll travel
to each other on weekends.

17:33.661 --> 17:36.098
Think about it.
Your hours are long anyway.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.708
It's not like
I'd even see you

17:37.752 --> 17:39.232
during the week
when you're shooting.

17:39.275 --> 17:42.713
I mean, I want you to be happy.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.151
W-Will commuting make you happy?

17:45.194 --> 17:46.500
I think it will.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.329
Okay. Then...

17:49.372 --> 17:51.331
let's do it.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.072
Oh.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.074
Thank you, Rogelio.

18:01.297 --> 18:04.213
So I finished my vows.

18:04.257 --> 18:07.347
And I'm so sorry about earlier.

18:07.390 --> 18:10.437
No. No. I...
I overreacted.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.439
Your book is so important.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.310
You'reimportant.

18:14.354 --> 18:17.226
I just wasn't worried
about writing my vows

18:17.270 --> 18:20.142
because I knew exactly
what I wanted to say.

18:20.186 --> 18:23.624
Because I think about how lucky
I am to be with you every day.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.843
And I'm so excited
about our wedding,

18:25.887 --> 18:29.586
but I'm most excited
about our future together.

18:31.588 --> 18:34.200
Because it's not like the
telenovelas I grew up watching.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.334
The wedding isn't the end.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.336
Our story is just beginning.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.251
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Stop rubbing it in!

18:42.295 --> 18:44.035
Thanks.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.388
I think I'm just feeling
a little vulnerable.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.391
You know, last night you told me
my birth parents are dead,

18:51.434 --> 18:53.436
and it didn't even faze me.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.092
Because of how
much I love you.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.399
And that's a lot
to put on someone.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.879
Not too much.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.925
And just because
I can't wait for the future,

19:03.968 --> 19:05.927
I don't want
to skip this moment.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.363
So let's not wait.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.191
Let's take our honeymoon
right away.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.454
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG. Is it finally time

19:11.498 --> 19:13.282
for that big splurge?

19:13.326 --> 19:15.110
And because
we never go on vacations,

19:15.154 --> 19:17.199
I have a million points
for flights and hotels,

19:17.243 --> 19:19.027
so we'll barely pay
for any of it.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.681
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Nope, guess not.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.552
I'm in.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165
Oh.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.038
Oh, no.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.433
You have to go.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.307
Turn around

19:38.351 --> 19:39.700
and go back home.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.223
Hello to you, too, Ma.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.485
Abuela called.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.226
Thank you, Abuela.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.315
What do you mean
you're not moving?

19:48.448 --> 19:51.015
I thought about it,
and it's just not what I want.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.496
I mean, I shouldn't
have to upend my life.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.455
This isn't the 1950s.

19:55.498 --> 19:57.065
You were the one who
looked into nursing schools.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.371
You said you wanted to go.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.503
And I changed my mind.
I want to stay here.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.505
Because Mateo freaked out?

20:02.549 --> 20:04.203
He's a kid, Ma.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.595
He's also right.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.163
I don't have to go
if I don't want to, and I don't.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.035
I want to be here for things
like your book coming out,

20:11.079 --> 20:13.081
and-and dinners
and birthdays, and-and...

20:21.568 --> 20:24.484
It's so stupid.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.877
I'm 46 years old,
and I've lived near you

20:26.921 --> 20:28.792
for my whole life, Mom.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.273
And for yourwhole life.

20:31.317 --> 20:34.058
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall our Jane
wasn't fond of endings.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.365
And now what? That's just over?

20:36.409 --> 20:38.498
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A trait
she got from her mother.

21:13.576 --> 21:16.100
You're coming with me
to New York?!

21:16.144 --> 21:18.320
Oh, thank God. I'm so glad.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.496
I love you so much.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.499
And I love you, too!

21:23.543 --> 21:24.979
Oh. Uh, thanks.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.546
What are you doing here?

21:26.589 --> 21:28.112
Oh. Oh, I just...
I just came...

21:28.156 --> 21:31.420
to give you this...
for the wedding tomorrow.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.598
Is that a... necklace?

21:35.642 --> 21:37.774
Uh, I... I wasn't planning
on wearing any jewelry.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.341
It's a lazo de novia.

21:39.385 --> 21:42.213
It's a Mexican wedding lasso.

21:42.257 --> 21:44.694
Loved ones place it
around the bride and groom

21:44.738 --> 21:47.349
during the ceremony
as a symbol of unity.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.960
My-my father gave it to me,

21:50.004 --> 21:52.702
and now, I will like
to pass it on to you.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.487
Thank you.
Yeah.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.924
Also, I wanted to apologize.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.492
I put you on the spot
with the whole "dad" thing.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.145
I appreciate that.

22:01.189 --> 22:04.801
But we're in private now, so...

22:04.845 --> 22:07.543
if you want
to try it out, that's...

22:09.850 --> 22:11.808
I'm sorry.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.941
It just doesn't really
roll off the tongue,

22:13.984 --> 22:16.030
but you know I love you.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.602
Is everything okay?

22:22.645 --> 22:24.821
I don't know.
I'm... I'm blowing up.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.346
Something's happening
online, but...

22:27.389 --> 22:30.174
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, that's when
he realized...

22:30.218 --> 22:32.176
Oh, my God.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.917
My social media is exploding.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.571
I'm doubling--

22:35.615 --> 22:38.313
no, tripling in followers.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.055
Which means people
must be watching

22:41.098 --> 22:42.622
the This Is Marspilot.

22:42.665 --> 22:46.452
This could be it, Rafael.

22:46.495 --> 22:49.498
I-I could be breaking through
in America.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.892
Well, I hope so.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.111
Oh, yeah, me, too.

22:54.155 --> 22:57.506
But-but-but we should keep this
between us right now

22:57.550 --> 22:59.160
because I-I don't want to steal
Jane's thunder, you know.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.205
She's getting married tomorrow.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.424
As am I.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.817
JANE:
I can't believe it.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.949
Our last night together.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.560
I know.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.485
Ah, man.

23:19.528 --> 23:23.184
Who didn't turn
out the lights?

23:23.227 --> 23:26.622
Hey, I have a big day tomorrow,
remember?

23:26.666 --> 23:29.712
I'm moving,
it's so hard.

23:38.112 --> 23:41.245
Okay, okay.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.293
Love you, Abuela.

24:24.767 --> 24:25.899
ALBA:
I am overwhelmed

24:25.942 --> 24:27.770
by the love and support

24:27.814 --> 24:29.163
in this room.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.009
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, friends,

24:49.052 --> 24:51.185
there was this very moment...

25:42.802 --> 25:46.370
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But alas,
the moment is already gone.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.289
Everything okay?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.813
My editor.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.858
It's not important.

25:55.902 --> 25:58.774
Today is about...

26:00.820 --> 26:02.735
Him.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.388
Hey, there, my groom.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.652
Hey, bride-to-be,
happy wedding day.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.828
So, according to the schedule,

26:08.871 --> 26:10.481
hair and makeup
should be arriving...

26:10.525 --> 26:11.613
Ah, they just got here.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.093
Oh, great.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.703
And did your editor
get your changes in time?

26:14.747 --> 26:16.836
No, but you know what?
It's fine.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.968
They'll make the switch when
they print the real book.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.710
But what about Isabel Allende?
She won't read your ending.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.625
There must be something
you can do.

26:23.669 --> 26:24.974
Nothing short of hand-delivering
a flash drive

26:25.018 --> 26:26.541
to the printing press.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.803
Which I would never do
on our wedding day.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.413
Don't worry.

26:29.457 --> 26:30.806
I have no interest
in running off

26:30.850 --> 26:32.460
on some crazy adventure today.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.027
I'll see youat the altar.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.115
I love you.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.160
I love you, too.

26:40.381 --> 26:43.427
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well,
she might not be interested,

26:43.471 --> 26:46.256
but it looks like he is.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.092
Hello? Hello?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.139
Uh, can I help you?

26:59.182 --> 27:00.314
Stop the presses.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.012
Isn't that what they say?

27:03.056 --> 27:04.753
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
In the 1920s.

27:04.797 --> 27:05.928
I'm sorry.

27:05.972 --> 27:08.931
I-I have a-a huge favor
to ask you.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.196
Oh, hey,
thanks again, man.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.458
You're a lifesaver.No problem.

27:14.502 --> 27:15.851
Hey, good luck, buddy.Thank you!

27:28.429 --> 27:29.473
Hello?

27:33.216 --> 27:35.305
Hello!

27:39.875 --> 27:41.094
Ah, screw it.

27:45.315 --> 27:48.667
Whoo!LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Guess Jane's splurging on that gate.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.021
Oh.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.675
Hi, almost-husband.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.937
Don't worry, I'm right
on schedule.

27:57.980 --> 28:01.201
Yeah, our schedule might
have to change a little.

28:01.244 --> 28:04.595
I got arrested and I need
to be bailed out.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.080
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Speaking of family stories,

28:11.124 --> 28:13.517
this one would be
repeated often.

28:13.561 --> 28:14.736
And then he drove his car
through the gate

28:14.780 --> 28:16.085
and got arrested so I have
to go get him.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.957
But Mom took the car
to pick up Jorge.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.436
I'll call a car.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.569
Jane, wait, let me go.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.703
It's your wedding.That's why it has to be me.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.356
What Raf did was so romantic,

28:26.400 --> 28:28.054
I have to be the one
to go get him!

28:28.097 --> 28:29.751
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sure.

28:29.795 --> 28:30.839
What could go wrong?

28:36.497 --> 28:38.804
Wha...?

28:38.847 --> 28:40.370
Philipe, hey. What's going on?

28:40.414 --> 28:41.850
It's been saying you're
ten minutes away

28:41.894 --> 28:43.591
for about 20 minutes now.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.636
PHILIPE: I can't get to you
because of the marathon.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.812
Can you meet me
on Plymouth Street?

28:46.855 --> 28:48.248
It's just a few blocks away.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.858
Uh, y-yeah, sure.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.078
I-I'll be right there.

29:02.436 --> 29:03.393
Yeah. Oh. Yikes!

29:03.437 --> 29:04.655
Coming through!

29:04.699 --> 29:05.874
Nice hair.

29:05.918 --> 29:06.875
Thank you.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.355
It's my wedding day!

29:08.398 --> 29:09.530
Oh, sorry.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.750
Got it! You got it!

29:11.793 --> 29:13.316
Keep going.
Thank you.

29:18.234 --> 29:21.063
Ah, Philipe.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.935
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And suddenly, in a moment

29:22.978 --> 29:27.766
of sheer coincidence or part
of the grand plan all along...

29:31.160 --> 29:33.772
Hop on, Jane.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.130
I am so sorry,
but is there any way

29:44.173 --> 29:45.435
that we could make
a quick detour

29:45.479 --> 29:46.741
and stop at
the police station?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.177
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
After all this time,

29:48.221 --> 29:50.397
doesn't she know
how buses work?

29:50.440 --> 29:52.399
You see, I'm getting married
today and, well,

29:52.442 --> 29:54.009
my fiancé and I have been
through so much.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.794
An accidental insemination,
a kidnapping, an evil twin,

29:55.837 --> 29:57.230
a husband returning
from the dead

29:57.273 --> 29:58.927
and this is our last obstacle.

29:58.971 --> 30:02.191
So I'm begging you--
can you please help me?

30:02.235 --> 30:04.672
No.

30:04.715 --> 30:07.762
I will pay you $5,000
to rent out the whole bus.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.764
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Guess Jane's finally decided
what to splurge on.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.766
What about us?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.115
How much you gonna pay us?

30:13.159 --> 30:15.814
How's, uh, $50 each?

30:16.902 --> 30:18.120
A hundred?

30:18.164 --> 30:19.382
I got things to do, lady.

30:19.426 --> 30:20.862
I got to go to the bank,
the dry cleaners,

30:20.906 --> 30:22.124
the nail salon...$200.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.473
Final offer. Please.

30:23.517 --> 30:24.997
I'm getting married
in 56 minutes.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.219
That'll work.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.612
Ah, great!

30:31.655 --> 30:34.658
To the police station.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.803
JANE:
All right, we're good.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.588
Oh.

30:51.632 --> 30:52.851
Oh. Hey, Mom.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.156
XIOMARA:
Where are you? We're all here.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.897
I'm coming
and I got the groom.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.638
I'll text you the address
of where we'll pick you all up.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.292
XIOMARA:
W-What are you driving?
Is it big enough?

30:59.335 --> 31:01.642
Oh, yeah, i-it's big enough.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.954
Make way! Make way!

31:08.997 --> 31:11.957
Wedding party of Jane Gloriana
Villanueva coming through!

31:13.132 --> 31:15.003
It's okay!

31:15.047 --> 31:16.918
Save the dress!

31:16.962 --> 31:19.747
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, that's when...

31:19.790 --> 31:20.922
Aren't you
Rogelio De La Vega

31:20.966 --> 31:22.489
from that show
that just dropped--

31:22.532 --> 31:23.925
the dude from
This Is Mars.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.145
Oh, yeah. You're hilarious, man.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.929
Yes, yes, it is I.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.279
Rogelio De La Vega.
American star.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.107
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which he will be
very shortly, friends.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.067
In fact, here's a little taste
of what's to come.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.422
XIOMARA:
Cross over!

31:42.465 --> 31:43.640
Yes.

31:43.684 --> 31:44.903
Come on! Hurry!

31:44.946 --> 31:46.774
Oh! Excuse me.

31:46.817 --> 31:49.951
Jane, we're here.
Where are you?

31:49.995 --> 31:50.996
JANE:
Mom!

31:51.039 --> 31:52.823
Let's go!

31:54.695 --> 31:56.610
XIOMARA:
Ma'am-- you, stand right here.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.742
Sir, can you stand
right here, please?

31:58.786 --> 32:00.570
But don't look, either.
Turn around.

32:03.486 --> 32:06.663
Oh, red light.
Hand me the eyeliner.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.406
How's it going back there?

32:10.450 --> 32:11.451
No! Don't look!

32:11.494 --> 32:12.495
WOMAN:
Are you crazy?

32:14.062 --> 32:15.063
You need help?

32:15.107 --> 32:17.936
Oh, yeah, thank you.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.984
Okay, we are now
officially late.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.769
Don't sweat it; they
won't start without you.

32:25.813 --> 32:29.121
I was a nervous groom
once, too, you know.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.514
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Actually, three times,
but who's counting?

32:31.558 --> 32:33.908
But you are going
to get there,

32:33.952 --> 32:37.303
and you are going to
be so happy together.

32:37.346 --> 32:40.088
Not always, of course.

32:40.132 --> 32:42.438
At times, things
will be difficult.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.441
And you will fight, and
you will stomp around--

32:45.485 --> 32:47.704
at least that's what I do.

32:47.748 --> 32:50.098
But you will get
through the hard times,

32:50.142 --> 32:52.927
because there will
be so much joy.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.929
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which was true, for the record.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.975
So much joy.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.020
Thank you...

32:59.064 --> 33:00.587
Rogelio is fine.

33:00.630 --> 33:03.111
Now... Inhala...

33:04.808 --> 33:05.896
Exhala.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.159
Yeah.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.899
PETRA:
Everyone just relax.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.685
They'll be here any minute.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.469
You know, I actually
didn't get to do,

33:13.513 --> 33:15.776
uh, some of my jokes
from the rehearsal dinner.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.038
Anyone want to hear them now?

33:17.082 --> 33:19.475
Not now, not ever.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.695
Oh, my God.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.697
She's here.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.177
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG. I'm not ready!

33:25.220 --> 33:27.962
Oh. Wrong Jane.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.705
But damn, she looks good!

33:33.750 --> 33:34.925
Oh!

33:34.969 --> 33:36.971
What are you doing here?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.668
Rafael called.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.453
He what?!Yeah, he told me that

33:40.496 --> 33:43.499
you still had feelings for me,
and he made this big speech

33:43.543 --> 33:45.980
about how life is too short,
and I know it's corny,

33:46.024 --> 33:49.418
but my mom just died, and...

33:49.462 --> 33:51.377
I've been thinking
about you so much lately.

33:51.420 --> 33:52.943
And honestly,
I never stopped loving you,

33:52.987 --> 33:54.771
and I just...

33:58.514 --> 34:00.516
Mmm.

34:04.216 --> 34:05.913
I love you, too.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.178
And I'm so sorry
about your mother.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.745
Thank you.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.181
I'm sorry about yours.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.183
Oh, don't worry.
She's gone, too.

34:15.227 --> 34:18.534
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, and let me show you
where she went.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.638
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
What can I say but...

34:35.682 --> 34:39.077
straight out of a telenovela.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.385
Which brings us back...

34:43.429 --> 34:45.257
Here! We're here!

34:51.176 --> 34:52.786
I couldn't be more ready.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.793
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As you well know,

34:59.836 --> 35:01.055
because I've been telling you,

35:01.099 --> 35:04.580
telenovelas end
with a wedding.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.801
And after a long journey,

35:07.844 --> 35:11.065
we are finally at ours.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.328
Aw.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.340
Thank you.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.398
PEOPLE:
Aw!

35:39.441 --> 35:41.095
Oh!

35:54.978 --> 35:57.851
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It should be noted,
at this very moment,

35:57.894 --> 35:59.853
Jane's passions included...

35:59.896 --> 36:03.117
her family...

36:03.161 --> 36:04.945
God...

36:04.988 --> 36:09.558
grilled cheese sandwiches...

36:09.602 --> 36:12.387
writing...

36:12.431 --> 36:15.347
and... Rafael Solano.

36:33.103 --> 36:36.542
Thank you all
for being here today.

36:36.585 --> 36:40.372
To begin,
we have a selected reading

36:40.415 --> 36:43.810
from Love is You & Me.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.904
"Love is me, and love is you.

36:50.947 --> 36:53.341
So when you smile,
I smile, too."

36:53.385 --> 36:54.995
PEOPLE:
Aw.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.997
ANNA:
"When you're around,
the skies are blue.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.305
It's like being
happy times two."

37:04.396 --> 37:06.485
"Love is fun!

37:06.528 --> 37:08.487
"It's feeling free!
Love lets you

37:08.530 --> 37:10.532
be who you want to be!"

37:10.576 --> 37:11.881
Wow. You're using
your big-boy voice!

37:11.925 --> 37:13.274
I practiced with Great Glamma.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.885
She said I'd be great
at voice-over work.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.584
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
And for the record, I am.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.327
: But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.981
ALBA:
Now, I will be
speaking Spanish,

37:25.025 --> 37:27.636
so for those of you
who are Spanish-impaired...

37:27.680 --> 37:31.292
...there are translations
in the programs.

38:14.074 --> 38:16.424
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which,
for the record, was true.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.299
Oh.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.215
We place this around you

39:08.258 --> 39:11.479
as a symbol of unity
and commitment.

39:11.523 --> 39:13.568
ROGELIO:
Now the everlasting

39:13.612 --> 39:16.528
bond between you is sealed.

39:17.572 --> 39:19.618
Thank you...

39:19.661 --> 39:21.620
Dad.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.491
Oh...

39:23.535 --> 39:26.189
Mom?

39:26.233 --> 39:27.016
No, thank you.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.508
Jane...

39:40.552 --> 39:43.250

39:44.556 --> 39:46.514
Jane...

39:46.558 --> 39:48.951
you made...

39:48.995 --> 39:50.953
Maybe you should
go first.

39:58.004 --> 40:00.572
Rafael,
the first time we met,

40:00.615 --> 40:03.270
you told me to be brave,

40:03.313 --> 40:05.272
and...

40:05.315 --> 40:07.317
Okay.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.583
Rafael...

40:14.890 --> 40:17.110
Maybe we should just...

40:17.153 --> 40:18.416
Yeah.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.026
Yeah. Yeah.Sorry. We're just gonna read...

40:20.069 --> 40:21.375
them for ourselves.Yeah.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.117

Which, friends,

40:24.160 --> 40:26.249
they did.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.391

Sorry, Abuela.

40:40.263 --> 40:43.832

42:24.280 --> 42:27.196
Let's just sit here
for another minute.

42:30.896 --> 42:33.202
So, I never asked you.

42:33.246 --> 42:34.900
Hmm?

42:34.943 --> 42:37.772
What happens
at the end of your book?

42:37.816 --> 42:40.993
They make it into
a telenovela.
