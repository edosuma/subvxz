WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:05.673
MMM, MMM.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.076
NOTHING TASTES BETTER
THAN AN APPLE
YOU PICKED YOURSELF.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.178
COME ON. I WANNA MAKE
CANDIED APPLES.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.812
IN A MINUTE.
NOW, WHO WANTS CIDER?

00:11.845 --> 00:14.115
NONE FOR ME. THE GUY
WHO WAS SPRAYING 'EM,

00:14.148 --> 00:16.417
HE HAD LIKE THIS
BIG LUMP ON HIS NECK.

00:16.450 --> 00:20.654
WELL, MORE FOR US,
HUH, HENRY?

00:24.492 --> 00:27.228
THIS TASTES FUNNY.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.197
WHOA.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.165
THIS CIDER'S TURNED.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.034
TURNED INTO WHAT?

00:35.136 --> 00:37.471
INTO GROWN-UP CIDER.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.577
I DON'T LIKE IT.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

00:43.611 --> 00:47.181
'CAUSE WE HAVE A FAMILY
HISTORY OF LIKING IT.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.217
DAD?

00:49.250 --> 00:51.085
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR EYE?

00:51.119 --> 00:53.121
I GOT PEPPER-SPRAYED.
WHAT

00:53.154 --> 00:56.157
YEAH, YEAH. YEAH,
I'LL BE...I'LL BE FINE.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.659
YOU GO OFF FOR A ROMANTIC
GETAWAY WITH YOUR WIFE,

00:58.692 --> 01:01.129
AND YOU COME HOME ALONE
AND PEPPER-SPRAYED.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.397
EVERYTHING WAS FINE
UNTIL WEDNESDAY MORNING

01:03.431 --> 01:06.100
WHEN WE WERE
GETTING READY FOR WORK.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.504
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

01:10.538 --> 01:12.840
IT'S NOTHING.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.676
WEIRD DREAM.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.347
OK, OK, COME ON.
WHAT WAS IT?

01:19.380 --> 01:23.651
OK. WE WERE IN THIS
WEIRD PARKING GARAGE.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.156
SEAN, WHERE DID WE PARK?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.692
SEAN?

01:33.927 --> 01:38.166
SEAN, YOU HAVE THE KEYS.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.737
AAH!

01:43.771 --> 01:46.240
CLAUDIA!

01:46.274 --> 01:48.476
CLAUDIA!

01:48.509 --> 01:52.413
CLAUDIA!

02:05.493 --> 02:06.560
I'M...I'M...SORRY.

02:06.594 --> 02:12.300
I DIDN'T PUT ANY FOOD OUT.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS TODAY.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.773
DID YOU PUT FOOD OUT?

02:21.275 --> 02:23.811
IS THIS WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

02:23.844 --> 02:27.315
THANK GOD.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.694
MMM. SPICY.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.496
CILANTRO.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.733
CILANTRO ISN'T SPICY.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.537
IT IS, THE WAY I USE IT.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS?

02:56.344 --> 03:00.214
PLEASE HOLD ALL QUESTIONS
UNTIL THE END.

03:08.289 --> 03:12.326
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN OVERWHELMED
BY THE BEAUTY.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.763
HEY, I'VE GOT
YOUR BEAUTY RIGHT HERE.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.398
SURREN--

03:17.431 --> 03:20.401
SURRENDER, DOROTHY!

03:21.835 --> 03:23.471
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

03:23.504 --> 03:24.938
PRETTY WEIRD.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.807
YEAH. ME AND EDDIE?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.008
YEAH. THAT...

03:28.041 --> 03:31.379
AND...AND I JUST
TOTALLY DISAPPEARED?

03:31.412 --> 03:41.422
YEAH.

03:41.455 --> 03:47.995
YEAH.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.433
WELL, THAT'S ALL THE APPLES,
SO I GUESS WE'RE DONE.

03:52.466 --> 03:56.270
BUT WE STILL HAVE
ALL THIS RED GOO.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.240
HEY, HOW ABOUT
CANDIED BANANAS?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.910
YOU DON'T
DIP BANANAS, DIP.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.380
WELL,
MAYBE YOU DON'T.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.949
YEAH, SHE IS BAD.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.985
BUT THE SWEATIEST
PERSON IN SCHOOL HAS
GOT TO BE MONICA BARRY.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.655
HAVE YOU EVER STOOD
NEXT TO HER IN GYM?

04:14.688 --> 04:15.656
OH, GOD, YES.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.759
WELL, I SAT NEXT TO HER
BROTHER ONCE ON THE BUS,

04:18.792 --> 04:21.462
AND HE SMELLED LIKE EGGS.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.433
OH, HI. I'M SORRY.
WERE WE TALKING TO YOU?

04:25.466 --> 04:26.734
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.936
HAVE YOU
EVER SMELLED EGGS?

04:28.969 --> 04:29.937
IS SOMEONE TALKING?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.305
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.073
YOU WANT SOME JUICE?
SURE.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.376
THE THING
ABOUT THIS JUICE--

04:35.409 --> 04:38.679
GOD, IT'S
STILL TALKING!

04:38.712 --> 04:40.914
OK, FINE.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.723
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

04:50.991 --> 04:54.728
I DON'T SEE WHY YOU LET
A LITTLE DREAM BOTHER YOU.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.898
IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME, OK?

04:59.733 --> 05:02.069
IT SEEMED
LIKE IT BOTHERED YOU.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.071
IT DIDN'T.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.939
IT DIDN'T...

05:05.973 --> 05:08.476
UNTIL I TALKED TO EDDIE.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.979
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I NAILED YOUR WIFE.

05:12.012 --> 05:12.946
WHOA...

05:12.980 --> 05:15.349
YOU DIDN'T NAIL HER,
ALL RIGHT? IT WAS A DREAM.

05:15.383 --> 05:18.752
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT WAS A DREAM
AND THIS IS REAL LIFE?

05:18.786 --> 05:22.022
MAYBE THIS IS A DREAM
AND THAT DREAM IS
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.492
LOOK, CLAUDIA
DOESN'T WANT YOU.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.526
THINK ABOUT IT.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.696
SHE'S FEELING LOST,
EMPTY, ALONE.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.799
SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER CAR.
SHE WANTS TO TURN IT ON.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.768
SHE WANTS IGNITION.
SHE WANTS TO BE IGNITED.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.137
BY YOU?
BY WHAT I REPRESENT.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.038
WHICH IS?

05:38.071 --> 05:39.306
WHICH IS EVERY SINGLE,
CARNAL, SCANDALOUS,

05:39.339 --> 05:44.077
FORBIDDEN FANTASY
THAT SHE'S EVER HAD
THAT YOU CAN'T FULFILL.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.581
TRUST ME. I CAN
FULFILL HER FANTASIES.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.917
YEAH, IF HER FANTASY
IS BEING BORED.

05:49.950 --> 05:50.918
SHE'S NOT BORED.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.721
OF COURSE NOT.
YOU GUYS GET IT ON
ALL THE TIME.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.624
YEAH, WE DO.
YOU GOT IT DOWN TO A SCIENCE.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.891
YOU BETCHA.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.494
NOBODY LIKES SCIENCE.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.598
BUT THEN IT HIT ME.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.767
CLAUDIA AND I, WE USED
TO BE SO OUTRAGEOUS.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.471
OH, BABY, YOU'RE SO HOT.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.740
OH, MAMA.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.810
BUT NOW
WE'RE MORE LIKE...

06:16.844 --> 06:19.913
OH, BABY, YOU'RE SO HOT.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.049
OOH, MAMA.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.054
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD HAPPEN TO US.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.524
YOU KNOW, I NEVER
THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD
GET INTO A RUT.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.660
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

06:32.693 --> 06:37.731
A RUT IS THE BREAD AND BUTTER
OF A LASTING RELATIONSHIP.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.868
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT YOU AND MOM
WERE IN A RUT?

06:40.901 --> 06:45.005
AH, FOR 34 BEAUTIFUL YEARS.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.941
YOUR MOTHER AND I WERE
SO COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER,

06:47.975 --> 06:51.912
THERE WERE SOME DAYS
WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.750
THAT'S NICE.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.587
YEAH. I MISS IT.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.690
OH, JIMMY, JIMMY.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.024
COME HERE. COME HERE.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.695
WE NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR US.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.696
YEAH?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.931
LEAVE.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.802
NO, NO! COME BACK.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.605
WE'RE JUST KIDDING.
WE'RE JUST KIDDING.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.438
OK, OK.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.508
ALISON THINKS
THAT A GUY WOULD LIKE IT

07:20.541 --> 07:23.243
IF A GIRL JUST CALLS
HIM UP OUT OF THE BLUE

07:23.276 --> 07:25.513
AND TELLS HIM
THAT SHE LIKES HIM.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.081
YEAH, A GUY WOULD
BE COOL WITH THAT.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.783
I TOLD YOU.

07:29.817 --> 07:33.887
FINE. WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.925
HEY, WHEN DID
YOU GET SO CUTE?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.095
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

07:42.129 --> 07:46.934
WELL, I'M PRETTY
MATURE FOR MY AGE.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.770
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.072
MORE CIDER?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.913
OK, OK. SHH!

07:59.947 --> 08:01.915
IT'S RINGING.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.585
SHH.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.687
UM, HI. JASON?

08:06.720 --> 08:09.723
IT'S LILY FINNERTY.

08:09.757 --> 08:13.093
I THINK YOU ARE SO HOT,

08:13.126 --> 08:15.696
HOT, HOT,

08:15.729 --> 08:19.032
HOT-OT-OT-OT...

08:19.066 --> 08:22.636
WITH A CAPITAL "T."

08:23.937 --> 08:26.073
I THINK HE LIKES ME.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.242
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU LET
EDDIE GET TO YOU LIKE THAT.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.377
DREAMS DON'T MEAN A THING.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.313
OH, YEAH? WELL,
EVERY PSYCHIATRIST
OF THE LAST CENTURY

08:33.346 --> 08:35.182
WOULD HAVE TO DISAGREE
WITH YOU ON THAT ONE.

08:35.215 --> 08:39.252
WHAT DO THEY KNOW? A BUNCH
OF PROFESSIONAL PERVERTS.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.556
HEY, HENRY.
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

08:42.590 --> 08:46.026
CANDIED CHICKEN WING.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.029
WANT A BITE?

08:49.062 --> 08:52.232
NO. NO, NO.
NO, THANKS. NO, THANKS.

08:52.833 --> 08:57.170
YOU KNOW, I HAD A REALLY
WEIRD DREAM LAST NIGHT.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.874
HENRY, CAN YOU
PLEASE PASS THE PEAS?

09:00.908 --> 09:04.011
I'LL GIVE YOU PEAS.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.980
HENRY, WHAT'D
YOU DO THAT FOR?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.818
FATHER, I'M GOING
TO KILL YOU.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.219
NO!

09:12.252 --> 09:14.087
I'M STABBED.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.189
WILL YOU MARRY ME, MOM?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.859
OF COURSE, HENRY.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.961
I LOVE YOU THE BEST.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.130
THINK IT MEANS ANYTHING?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.098
UH, NO.
NO.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.601
IT'S RANDOM.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.670
SEE? DREAMS
DO MEAN SOMETHING.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.904
I HAD THAT SAME
DREAM ABOUT YOU.

09:30.938 --> 09:35.909
YOU THINK THIS DREAM
OF CLAUDIA'S MEANS
THAT SHE WANTS EDDIE?

09:35.943 --> 09:37.044
NO. NO. NO.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.747
SHE WANTS ME
TO BE MORE ROMANTIC
AND MORE SPONTANEOUS.

09:39.780 --> 09:44.151
OK? SO I WENT
BY HER WORK,
AND I DID SOMETHING...

09:44.184 --> 09:46.019
STUPID.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.757
I'M SORRY. I HAVE
NOTHING AVAILABLE MONDAY.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.892
LET ME JUST CHECK
THE BOOK FOR YOU.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.695
HELLO, CLAUDIA.
SEAN, IS EVERYTHING OK?

09:54.728 --> 09:58.365
BABY, THESE ARE FOR YOU.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.067
THANKS.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.403
I'M SORRY. THE FIRST
AVAILABLE I HAVE IS
THURSDAY THE 18th AT 7:00.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.139
GREAT.
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.340
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:07.374 --> 10:11.044
MY LADY,
YOUR CHARIOT AWAITS.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.882
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:15.849 --> 10:17.885
I'M FULFILLING
YOUR EVERY FANTASY.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.386
SWEETIE, I'M AT WORK.
I KNOW.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.822
AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
I WAS GONNA WHISK YOU
AWAY TO THE PIER,

10:21.855 --> 10:25.893
AND WE'D HAVE A LITTLE
DINNER AND HAVE
A ROMANTIC EVENING.

10:25.926 --> 10:26.894
HONEY, I...

10:26.927 --> 10:27.895
HI. GOTTLIEBS.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.196
YES, YES.
TWO AT 7:30.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.163
YOU'RE JUST
A LITTLE BIT EARLY.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.199
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
HAVING A DRINK AT THE BAR.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.300
GREAT. THANK YOU.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.936
YOU DO REALIZE I DON'T GET
OFF WORK FOR 5 HOURS, RIGHT?

10:35.969 --> 10:39.372
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S SATURDAY. YOU WORK
THE EARLY SHIFT ON SATURDAY.

10:39.406 --> 10:43.143
NO, NO. THE SECOND SATURDAY
OF EVERY MONTH
I WORK THE DINNER SHIFT.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.377
15's OPEN.
GREAT.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.114
MR. HUGHES, RIGHT THIS WAY.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.349
UH...UH, CLAUD!

10:49.382 --> 10:51.251
BABY, I GOT A LIMO.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.786
JUST GO HAVE
A SEAT AT THE BAR.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.655
THE LIMO HAS A BAR. IT...

10:56.156 --> 10:57.725
LOOK, TONIGHT
IS OUR NIGHT, OK?

10:57.758 --> 11:00.193
COME ON. WE'RE GONNA GO
BE SPONTANEOUS. LET'S GO.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.194
WILL YOU LOOK AROUND?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.162
THIS IS A ZOO
IN HERE TONIGHT.
LOOK AT MY BOOK.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.464
I DON'T HAVE A MINUTE
TO BREATHE UNTIL 11:30.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.100
CAN'T YOU GET SOMEONE
TO FILL IN FOR YOU?

11:07.134 --> 11:08.368
WHAT?

11:08.401 --> 11:09.837
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
SOME PLACES DON'T
EVEN HAVE A HOSTESS.

11:09.870 --> 11:13.440
THEY JUST COME IN
AND THEY HAVE THIS SIGN
THAT SAYS "JUST SEAT YOURSELF."

11:13.473 --> 11:15.843
SO YOU THINK I CAN
BE REPLACED WITH A SIGN?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
NO! NO, THAT'S NOT
MY POINT, BABY.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.247
I'M JUST SAYING
OTHER RESTAURANTS...

11:20.280 --> 11:21.849
LOOK, I GOT A LIMO!

11:21.882 --> 11:22.750
EVENING, CLAUDIA.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.118
GOOD EVENING, MR. SANDERS.
EXCUSE ME, SEAN.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.987
BABY, PLEASE, JUST GIVE...

11:27.020 --> 11:28.221
MY BOOK, PLEASE.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.258
MR. SANDERS,
I HAVE YOU DOWN
FOR 8:00 TONIGHT.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.793
WHERE'S YOUR
WEDDING RING?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.161
I COULD'VE SWORN
I CHANGED IT.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.296
NOT A PROBLEM. I'M SURE
I CAN SQUEEZE YOU IN.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.032
WHY ARE YOU NOT WEARING
YOUR WEDDING RING?

11:39.066 --> 11:40.500
THIS IS ABOUT TIPS,
ALL RIGHT!

11:40.533 --> 11:43.403
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE.
IF MEN THINK YOU'RE SINGLE,
YOU GET BIGGER TIPS.

11:43.436 --> 11:47.941
OH, REALLY? THEN WHY
STOP WITH THE RING? WHY
NOT LOSE THE UNDERWEAR, TOO?

11:47.975 --> 11:48.976
MISS?

11:49.009 --> 11:49.743
MISSUS, PAL.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.111
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.081
IF YOU WANT A TABLE,
THEN I CAN HELP YOU.
IF NOT, I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.950
I DON'T WANT A TABLE.
GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT IN MY BOOK.

11:56.984 --> 12:00.120
GOOD, BECAUSE I'M...GOD!

12:19.172 --> 12:20.240
OH, MY GOD.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.943
I JUST MADE A BOOTY CALL.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.047
YES, YOU DID.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.917
A BOOTY CALL.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.154
BOOTY, BOOTY, BOOTY,
BOOTY, BOO-TAY.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.523
GIVE ME SOME
OF THAT BOO-TAY.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.893
SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE
THE NERVE TO DO THAT?

12:39.927 --> 12:42.095
I DON'T KNOW.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.164
MAY I TOP YOU OFF?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.800
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.569
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I INVITED JASON OVER,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.438
AND I LOOK LIKE CRAP.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.407
YEAH, YOU DO.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.980
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?
IT'S LIKE I'M DRUNK.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.216
HEY, WHO'S THIRSTY?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.420
WHAT'S IN THAT CIDER?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.890
APPLES.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.325
THIS IS ALCOHOLIC.

13:13.861 --> 13:14.594
REALLY?

13:14.627 --> 13:17.998
OH, MAN. WE'RE WASTED.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.134
AND JASON'S
COMING OVER HERE.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.937
OH, YOU'RE SO SCREWED.

13:24.437 --> 13:29.309
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CHUCKED
CLAUDIA'S RESERVATION BOOK
OUT INTO THE STREET.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.477
I KNOW. I KNOW.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.913
IT WAS AWFUL,
BUT I WAS FRUSTRATED.

13:32.946 --> 13:36.216
YOU GOT TO LEARN
TO CONTROL YOUR FRUSTRATIONS.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.617
OH, THIS FROM THE MAN

13:37.650 --> 13:40.854
WHO SPENT HALF HIS LIFE
SCREAMING AT APPLIANCES.

13:40.888 --> 13:41.855
WHAT?

13:41.889 --> 13:43.991
MENUS?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.361
MENUS ARE FOR RESTAURANTS!

13:49.296 --> 13:50.397
HELLO?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.867
STUPID CORDLESS PHONE!

13:53.901 --> 13:57.204
GIVE ME MY ENGLISH MUFFIN!

13:57.237 --> 13:58.872
AHH!

13:58.906 --> 14:02.009
I WAS HOPING
FOR MORE FROM YOU.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.911
WELL, YOU CAN BE PROUD

14:03.944 --> 14:08.448
BECAUSE MY CONSCIENCE
CAUGHT UP PRETTY QUICKLY.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.059
AHH!

14:23.931 --> 14:24.898
OH, NO.

14:24.932 --> 14:28.301
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
WHAT'S THIS CITY COMING TO?

14:28.335 --> 14:29.636
OH, UH...HEY, HONEY.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.405
SEAN, CAN I SEE YOU
IN THE KITCHEN ALONE?

14:32.439 --> 14:33.941
UH-OH.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.042
UH-HUH.

14:35.075 --> 14:39.879
RIGHT ABOUT NOW A RUT IS
LOOKING PRETTY GOOD, ISN'T IT?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.282
CHECK IT OUT.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.652
I DIPPED MY G.I. JOES.

14:45.685 --> 14:50.157
NOW IT'S ONE BIG JOE.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.691
OH! THAT'S TERRIFIC, HONEY.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.593
HOW ABOUT
IF YOU GO UPSTAIRS

14:53.626 --> 14:56.930
AND PLAY WITH THAT
ON SOME PLASTIC?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.401
CLAUDIA, I...I...I...

15:01.434 --> 15:03.636
SEAN, I DON'T WANNA FIGHT
ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT? I CAN'T.

15:03.670 --> 15:07.207
I'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH
THE SINGLE WORST NIGHT
OF MY ENTIRE WORKING LIFE,

15:07.240 --> 15:12.012
AND I JUST WANNA
SAY I AM SO SORRY
FOR HOW I TREATED YOU.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.280
YOU ARE?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.247
YES.

15:14.281 --> 15:18.685
I MEAN, YOU WERE CLUELESS
AND KIND OF A JERK,

15:18.718 --> 15:20.954
BUT YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO BE ROMANTIC.

15:20.988 --> 15:24.457
AND...GOD,
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE RING THING.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.526
I KNOW, BABY.
THAT REALLY HURT.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.729
I KNOW. IT WAS
SO STUPID OF ME.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.932
I'M SO SORRY.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.435
I FORGIVE YOU.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.370
IT'S OK, BABY,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.306
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
LOVE SOMEONE SO MUCH,

15:39.339 --> 15:43.010
YOU CAN JUST FORGIVE THEM
FOR ANYTHING.

15:45.778 --> 15:50.083
I STOLE
YOUR RESERVATION BOOK.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.385
YOU WHAT?

15:52.419 --> 15:55.622
I WAS JUST SO MAD AND
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT...

15:55.655 --> 15:56.723
YOU ASS!

15:56.756 --> 16:00.027
HEY! HEY!
I ACCEPTED YOUR APOLOGY.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.129
WELL, WHAT I DID
WAS FORGIVABLE!

16:02.162 --> 16:04.597
WAIT. THE BIBLE SAYS
ALL SINS ARE FORGIVABLE.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.765
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK!

16:05.798 --> 16:07.367
THIS IS A THOUSAND
TIMES WORSE THAN
ANYTHING IN THE BIBLE.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.104
WAIT. THEY CUT
JOHN THE BAPTIST'S HEAD OFF--

16:11.138 --> 16:13.006
OH, SHUT UP
AND GIVE ME BACK MY BOOK!

16:13.040 --> 16:16.109
I CAN'T, BABY. I LOST IT.

16:16.143 --> 16:16.943
YOU WHAT?!

16:16.976 --> 16:19.212
WHOA! YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T WANNA FIGHT.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.414
THAT WAS BEFORE
I KNEW WHAT YOU DID.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.751
BABY, I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.286
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.354
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.657
THEY'RE PULLING A COUPLE
OF DETECTIVES OFF A MURDER.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.493
YOU THREW AWAY MY BOOK.
YOU DON'T GET
TO BE SARCASTIC.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.462
BABY, LOOK, I DID
EVERYTHING I COULD THINK OF.

16:35.495 --> 16:40.067
I EVEN BROUGHT IN
AN EXPERT ON STOLEN GOODS.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.202
TAKE US TO ASTOR PLACE,
MY GOOD MAN.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.637
HEY, HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE BOOK'S GONNA BE THERE?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.274
OH. YOU GOT TO KNOW
THE CITY, MAN.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.576
YOU WANT SCUNGILLI,
YOU GO TO LITTLE ITALY.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.146
YOU WANT A FAKE ROLEX,
YOU GO TO CANAL STREET.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.815
YOU WANT A REAL ROLEX,
CALL ME UP. I'LL HOOK YOU UP.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.052
BUT IF I WANT
A RESERVATION BOOK,
I GO TO ASTOR PLACE?

16:59.086 --> 17:01.621
YEAH. EVERYTHING
ENDS UP AT ASTOR PLACE.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.656
IT'S LIKE eBAY...

17:03.690 --> 17:06.159
ONLY IT SMELLS.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.433
YO, YO, YO!
CHECK IT OUT, LADIES!

17:13.466 --> 17:15.235
WE'RE MULTIMILLIONAIRES!

17:15.268 --> 17:18.305
EDDIE, THEY'RE
FLIPPING YOU OFF.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.341
YOU GOT NO FREAKING CLASS!

17:21.374 --> 17:22.675
THERE. LOOK.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.745
PULL OVER! PULL OVER!

17:31.384 --> 17:33.120
HEY, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

17:33.153 --> 17:36.156
HOW MUCH FOR THAT
CRAPPY LITTLE BINDER?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.624
500 BUCKS.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.658
WHAT?

17:38.691 --> 17:39.626
500 BUCKS.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.562
COME ON, MAN. WE'LL
GIVE YOU 10 BUCKS FOR IT.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.597
PLEASE. YOU JUST
PULLED UP IN A LIMO.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.101
LISTEN, MAN.
I'VE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.870
I'VE WORKED
IN AFTER-MARKET RETAIL.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.472
SO TELL ME,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.507
WHAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN DO FOR US?

17:54.541 --> 17:55.775
THE BEST.

17:55.808 --> 17:56.843
FOR YOU GUYS?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.579
TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO.
500 BUCKS.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.648
NO! FORGET IT.
COME ON. 500 BUCKS?

18:01.681 --> 18:04.617
THIS BOOK HAS ROBERT De NIRO'S
HOME PHONE NUMBER IN IT.

18:04.651 --> 18:08.488
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE IT'S MY BOOK, MAN.
SO JUST GIVE IT BACK.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.223
JUST GET OUT
OF HERE. HEY!

18:10.257 --> 18:12.425
GIVE ME THE BOOK!

18:16.196 --> 18:17.264
AAH!

18:17.297 --> 18:19.332
OK, SO YOU SEE, YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE WHO'S SUFFERED.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.433
OK, I SUFFERED, TOO.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.235
YOU SUFFERED
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.370
NO, WHAT I DID FOR YOU.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.305
WHAT YOU DID
FOR ME TO MAKE UP
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.140
WAIT, BABY. I CAN'T FOLLOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

18:27.174 --> 18:31.144
THIS PEPPER SPRAY REACTED
BAD OR SOMETHING. IT'S REALLY...

18:31.178 --> 18:33.613
IT'S REALLY
DISORIENTING RIGHT NOW.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.517
WHOO! WHOA.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.293
HELLO.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.861
HI.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.630
ARE YOU OK?

18:52.265 --> 18:55.402
WHY

18:55.435 --> 18:56.736
WHOO.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.539
HEY, GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.141
NOW, KISS ME.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.878
WHAT'S ALL THIS THEN?

19:05.912 --> 19:07.814
OH, HELLO, UNCLE EDDIE.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.716
IS SHE DRUNK?

19:09.749 --> 19:10.850
I THINK SO.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.685
YOU GOT MY NIECE DRUNK?

19:12.719 --> 19:15.755
NO, NO, NO.
SHE WAS LIKE THIS
WHEN I GOT HERE.

19:15.788 --> 19:19.426
HEY, KID,
I KNOW GUYS LIKE YOU.
I AM A GUY LIKE YOU.

19:19.459 --> 19:23.162
WHAT?
LILY, WOULD YOU GO IN
FOR A SECOND?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.801
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
YOU'VE GOT AN ACTIVE MIND.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.603
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT FEELS LIKE

19:30.637 --> 19:35.242
TO GET HIT WITH A TIRE IRON
40 OR 50 TIMES?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.211
OW!

19:38.245 --> 19:40.747
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.720
UNCLE EDDIE, WHAT HAPPENED?

19:47.754 --> 19:49.589
WHERE'S MY JASON?

19:49.622 --> 19:52.325
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT HIM.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.594
HE WON'T BE
HURTING YOU ANYMORE.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.597
OH, GOD.
I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.799
I KNOW.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.236
* CLAUDIA

20:03.270 --> 20:05.238
EDDIE, THIS IS NOT
A GOOD TIME.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.373
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME?

20:06.406 --> 20:09.909
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD
'CAUSE I'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.644
OH, MY GOD. MY BOOK!

20:11.678 --> 20:12.879
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

20:12.912 --> 20:13.746
NO THANKS TO YOU,

20:13.780 --> 20:15.748
I MANAGED TO FIND A GUY
IN UNION SQUARE.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.284
I TRADED HIM
A BOOTLEG CASSETTE

20:17.317 --> 20:20.287
OF THE NEW PLANET
OF THE APES MOVIE.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.721
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

20:21.754 --> 20:26.025
I DIDN'T. I GOT A BLANK
LABEL ON A USED COPY
OF CROCODILE DUNDEE.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.728
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU
SO MUCH. MM!

20:28.761 --> 20:31.498
I'M THE MAN
OF YOUR DREAMS.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.400
SHH!

20:34.066 --> 20:35.402
YOU TOLD HIM?

20:35.435 --> 20:37.437
NO, BABY. NO.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.538
CLAUDIA, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.342
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD A COUPLE
OF DREAMS ABOUT YOU, TOO.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.844
OH! ENOUGH, EDDIE.
COME ON. GO.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.446
MAYBE WE SHOULD
COMPARE NOTES.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.916
I MEAN, LIKE YOU,
I HAVE A VERY UNUSUAL
SUBCONSCIOUS.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.050
YOU CAN GO.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.487
DO YOU OWN A RUBBER BRA?
JUST...

20:54.521 --> 20:56.956
DO YOU?
OUT.

20:58.057 --> 20:58.958
THE DREAM?

20:58.991 --> 21:00.493
BABY, I DON'T KNOW.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.761
I WAS UPSET ABOUT IT.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.996
OBVIOUSLY I SHOULDN'T
TELL YOU THINGS.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.932
WELL,
MAYBEYOU SHOULDN'T,

21:05.965 --> 21:08.401
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS WORRIED,

21:08.435 --> 21:11.338
AND I WANNA BE THE GUY
WHO'S MANHANDLING YOU

21:11.371 --> 21:12.572
IN SOME DIRTY ALLEY.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.907
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.

21:14.941 --> 21:15.975
SERIOUSLY?
NO.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.312
AW, COME ON
THERE'S AN ALLEY
BEHIND THE LAUNDROMAT.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.313
NO.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.049
ARE YOU WEARING ANYTHING
UNDER THAT LEATHER COAT?

21:23.082 --> 21:25.685
OK, MAYBE AFTER
THE KIDS ARE IN BED.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.686
HEY. HEY, MOM.

21:26.719 --> 21:31.090
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE
ALWAYS LOSING YOUR EARRINGS?

21:31.123 --> 21:33.092
NEVER AGAIN.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.563
WELL, THANKS, BABE.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.667
HEY, UH,
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

21:40.700 --> 21:42.702
BEATS ME.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.808
IF YOU TELL ANYONE
THAT WE MADE OUT,

21:48.841 --> 21:50.109
I WILL KILL YOU.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.312
WHO AM I GONNA TELL?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.052
STOP IT!

22:00.086 --> 22:01.621
LILY, ARE YOU OK?

22:01.654 --> 22:04.023
CAN YOU JUST
BE QUIET, PLEASE?

22:04.056 --> 22:06.493
WAIT. ARE YOU
HUNG OVER?

22:06.526 --> 22:07.994
NICE PARENTING, SEAN.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.997
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
WAS IN CHARGE LAST NIGHT.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.534
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
LET HER GET...GOOD LORD.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.902
WHERE'S THAT CIDER?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.404
WHAT CIDER?

22:17.437 --> 22:19.105
NO CIDER.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.774
DO YOU GUYS THINK THIS HICKEY
WILL LAST TILL MONDAY?

22:21.808 --> 22:24.811
LOOK AT THE TIME.
I GOT TO GO.
