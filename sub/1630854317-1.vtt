WEBVTT

01:25.041 --> 01:26.625
You cheated, you know.

01:26.708 --> 01:30.041
The Duel Arena has very clear rules.
No magic.

01:30.125 --> 01:33.750
It's not cheating if you win.
It's only cheating if you get caught.

01:33.833 --> 01:37.166
-Shall we go another round?
-No, we don't have time.

01:37.250 --> 01:40.291
Sparring with you is
the only part of the day I enjoy anymore.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.666
I enjoy it too, but we're needed.

01:42.750 --> 01:46.166
It's one of the downsides of overseeing
the most important school ever built.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.541
And I'm bored.

01:47.625 --> 01:49.458
Rafal, what do you want?

01:49.541 --> 01:51.250
Just one more round.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.666
Ugh.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.041
We'll both use our magic.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.375
No holds barred.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.250
Come on, Rhian.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.708
-Show me how it's done.

02:02.666 --> 02:03.750
You just don't stop--

02:13.791 --> 02:15.375
Rafal, that's enough!

02:15.458 --> 02:19.458
Maybe for you,
but I'm done settling for half.

02:19.541 --> 02:21.458
I want it all!

02:30.166 --> 02:31.250
No!

02:37.750 --> 02:40.666
Rafal, what have you done? That's…

02:43.875 --> 02:45.291
Blood magic.

02:45.375 --> 02:49.041
I've been searching for years,
but last night, I finally found it.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.708
Rafal, it's forbidden for a reason.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.250
It'll consume you. You can't control it.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.250
I prefer chaos.

03:06.791 --> 03:09.875
Thousands of years,
you always gave the heroes the upper hand!

03:09.958 --> 03:12.125
I held the balance with you.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.125
It's my turn now.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.500
Rafal…

03:20.583 --> 03:22.500
I dictate the terms.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.416
And it's going to be
a <i>very</i> different world.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.833
We can work together.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.791
Evil doesn't cooperate.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.416
Evil doesn't share.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.875
When I'm done…

03:37.250 --> 03:38.750
…Evil won't lose.

03:40.416 --> 03:41.791
No!

03:58.000 --> 03:59.291
Oh, Rafal.

04:30.375 --> 04:35.333
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there lived a girl named Sophie.</i>

04:36.125 --> 04:40.750
<i>A brave creature of exquisite beauty</i>
<i>and uncommon grace…</i>

04:42.291 --> 04:45.500
<i>…who was destined to change the world.</i>

04:52.166 --> 04:55.250
Now, listen up for the last time,

04:55.333 --> 04:57.916
you lazy, ridiculous girl.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.166
Get your candied ass out of bed now!

05:03.416 --> 05:05.708
Sophie, I know you can hear me!

05:05.791 --> 05:07.875
-Someone save me.

05:08.958 --> 05:12.083
Okay, I'm awake.
Don't break the door down.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.083
I will,
if you're not out in five minutes.

05:14.166 --> 05:18.083
-And no spending an hour on your hair.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.750
At least I have hair.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.875
All right, settle down, now, boys.

05:28.125 --> 05:29.791
Good morning, my dear family.

05:31.666 --> 05:35.291
Hey, don't waste that tomato, Sophie!
It was supposed to go in the stew!

05:35.375 --> 05:37.875
You've<i> got</i> to be kidding me.

05:37.958 --> 05:41.333
<i>Meanwhile, on the other side of Gavaldon,</i>

05:41.416 --> 05:46.458
<i>just outside of town,</i>
<i>in a humble cottage on top of Graves Hill…</i>

05:47.666 --> 05:51.291
<i>…there lived a girl named Agatha.</i>

05:56.833 --> 05:59.458
Dang it.

05:59.541 --> 06:02.000
You're too good
at staring contests, Reaper.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.958
-Come here a minute, Aggie?

06:08.791 --> 06:11.958
I'm making Great-Grandma's love potion
for the widow Grunfeld.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.458
It needs something.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.166
-Hemlock.
-Of course.

06:22.375 --> 06:27.083
<i>Agatha had no idea</i>
<i>if her mother was actually a witch</i>

06:27.166 --> 06:29.791
<i>since her potions never worked.</i>

06:29.875 --> 06:34.375
<i>But it was in Agatha</i>
<i>that her mother placed her highest hopes,</i>

06:34.458 --> 06:39.750
<i>knowing that her daughter</i>
<i>had the makings of a real witch.</i>

06:39.833 --> 06:42.958
<i>-A sentiment shared by Agatha's peers.</i>

06:43.041 --> 06:45.125
-Witch! Witch! Witch!

06:45.208 --> 06:48.208
-Burn her! Burn her!
-Witch! Witch!

06:50.625 --> 06:53.500
Hello there,
my little forest friends.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.083
Weirdos!

07:01.166 --> 07:02.791
-Freaks!

07:04.208 --> 07:06.333
God, I hate this town.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.541
<i>Fortunately, they had each other.</i>

07:14.375 --> 07:17.833
<i>A friendship between</i>
<i>two such different girls</i>

07:17.916 --> 07:23.291
<i>might have seemed unlikely,</i>
<i>but theirs was a special bond…</i>

07:23.375 --> 07:24.750
Oh, gross!

07:24.833 --> 07:26.958
<i>…forged at an early age.</i>

07:27.666 --> 07:32.708
<i>For it was the death of Sophie's mother,</i>
<i>the person who loved her most…</i>

07:32.791 --> 07:36.458
Always remember how special you are.

07:36.541 --> 07:39.125
You're gonna change the world someday.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.583
Then you'll live happily ever after.

07:41.666 --> 07:45.208
<i>…that brought her a friend</i>
<i>who loved her even more.</i>

07:45.291 --> 07:48.250
-Who's there?
-I… I made this for you.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.958
I'm sorry about your mom.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.916
<i>And it was</i>
<i>beneath the village wishing tree</i>

07:55.000 --> 07:59.500
<i>that they sealed a bond</i>
<i>they knew would last a lifetime.</i>

08:01.208 --> 08:03.750
Like, for literally
the hundredth time, no.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.916
-It wouldn't have to be a whole makeover.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.833
We could just do a cucumber eye mask.
Maybe a pumice scrub for your pores.

08:08.916 --> 08:10.875
-Hey, ugly.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.458
Aren't you gonna answer him?

08:12.541 --> 08:14.291
Not her, you.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.583
-Oh.
-Eric says you put a hex on him.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.208
-Who's Eric?

08:18.291 --> 08:21.791
-We've been in the same class eight years.
-He says you looked at him weird.

08:21.875 --> 08:23.666
And now he's feeling all itchy.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.791
I'm sorry,
that sounds more like a hygiene issue.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.500
Seriously. Lice, anyone?

08:27.583 --> 08:29.208
-Hey, shut up!

08:29.291 --> 08:33.666
You two think you're better than us,
but really, you're just a prig and a pig.

08:37.625 --> 08:38.625
Freaks.

08:40.666 --> 08:41.875
And I'm Eric.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.291
You know, I think he likes you.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.666
Who, Eric?

08:49.625 --> 08:51.041
I'm sorry, there's an Eric?

08:54.708 --> 08:58.416
Oh, I… I need to pick up some hemlock
from Mrs. Fisher for my mom.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.208
I gotta get some green fringe anyway.

09:00.291 --> 09:03.166
-I'll meet you at Deauville's.
-Wait, no, Sophie, I…

09:03.750 --> 09:05.541
Okay. Uh…

09:05.625 --> 09:07.208
Cool.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.666
Witch.

09:13.958 --> 09:17.375
-She's a witch.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.250
Hi.

09:23.958 --> 09:26.500
Hello there, little guy.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.916
-Aw, yeah, you like that?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.958
You're the girl lives in the graveyard.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.125
We live <i>by </i>the graveyard, yeah.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.250
Mm.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.958
You know, everyone…

09:41.041 --> 09:44.875
…and I mean everyone…
says you're a witch.

09:45.958 --> 09:49.583
You know what we used to do…
what we used to do to witches in Gavaldon?

09:50.833 --> 09:51.833
We burned 'em.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.708
-You have a really nice day, buddy.
-Whoa!

09:59.166 --> 10:03.083
We don't want witches in this town.

10:03.958 --> 10:04.958
Do you hear me?

10:05.708 --> 10:09.708
It's a threat
to the decent people of Gavaldon.

10:13.125 --> 10:16.458
You know, I seriously doubt
there are <i>any </i>decent people in Gavaldon.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.291
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.041
Let's… Let's get out of here.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.958
Hey, let's drop by Deauville's,
see if she's got anything new.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.875
Oh, don't you have to get home, though?

10:35.958 --> 10:38.083
C'mon. Let's see
if she's got something good.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.583
Ah!

10:42.666 --> 10:44.416
My favorite readers.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.625
Good thing you stopped by.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.500
We had a big delivery yesterday.

10:48.583 --> 10:51.375
-Any ghost stories?
-Yes, a few interesting-looking ones.

10:51.458 --> 10:52.500
Any new fairy tales?

10:52.583 --> 10:56.083
Nothing you haven't read
a thousand times before, Sophie.

10:56.166 --> 11:00.250
But I did spot some very interesting
older editions in there.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.125
Look, look! Dig around.

11:03.625 --> 11:04.875
Okay, this might sound crazy,

11:04.958 --> 11:08.291
but you ever think about
branching out of your comfort zone?

11:08.375 --> 11:11.125
Maybe, like, stop reading
little kids' books? Aww.

11:11.208 --> 11:14.333
To <i>The Blood of the Homunculus</i>?

11:14.416 --> 11:15.416
I'm good, thanks.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.458
Give me <i>Cinderella</i> any day.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.166
-Just look at the dresses in here.
-Ah.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.750
You found it.

11:23.541 --> 11:25.625
Just look at the embossing.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.291
Who's S.G.E.?

11:27.375 --> 11:30.375
Not who, what.
The School for Good and Evil.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.375
Don't tell me you've never heard of it.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.625
-Where is it?
-No one knows.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.500
Another time, another world.

11:38.583 --> 11:39.666
But legend has it,

11:39.750 --> 11:43.250
it's where the true story
behind every great fairy tale begins.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.583
-Ooh.
-The School for Good trains the heroes.

11:46.666 --> 11:49.083
The School for Evil, the villains.

11:49.666 --> 11:52.833
-Or so they say.
-The people in insane asylums, you mean.

11:52.916 --> 11:54.416
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

11:55.291 --> 11:58.666
Twenty years ago, a girl named Leonora
was taken from our village

11:58.750 --> 12:00.875
<i>-under a blood-red sky.</i>

12:04.958 --> 12:07.541
<i>Many believe the school</i>
<i>wanted her for some reason.</i>

12:10.250 --> 12:12.250
-<i>What happened to her?</i>

12:14.625 --> 12:16.625
-<i>No one knows.</i>

12:16.708 --> 12:18.791
She was never heard from again.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.875
That'd be one way to get out of this town.
Do they ever accept new students?

12:26.250 --> 12:28.541
You're joking, right?

12:31.166 --> 12:32.500
Yeah.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.833
<i>Dear School for Good and Evil.</i>

12:34.916 --> 12:39.583
<i>As a future princess, I wish very much</i>
<i>to attend your esteemed institution.</i>

12:39.666 --> 12:41.333
<i>Allow me to list the many attributes</i>

12:41.416 --> 12:44.291
<i>that I believe make me</i>
<i>a uniquely qualified candidate.</i>

12:44.375 --> 12:45.583
<i>From a very young age,</i>

12:45.666 --> 12:49.166
<i>I've always known</i>
<i>it's been my destiny to change the world.</i>

12:49.875 --> 12:53.541
<i>Willing to try anything</i>
<i>to escape her current life…</i>

12:53.625 --> 12:54.833
Please be real.

12:54.916 --> 12:58.958
<i>…Sophie entrusted</i>
<i>all her hopes for the future</i>

12:59.708 --> 13:02.666
<i>to the powers of the Wishing Tree.</i>

13:07.750 --> 13:10.875
-Oh, I hate my stepmother!
-Whoa, whoa. What?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.583
There's an opening at the factory,

13:12.666 --> 13:14.750
so she's making me quit school
to bring in more money.

13:14.833 --> 13:17.375
So I will quit too.
Can she get me a job there with you?

13:17.458 --> 13:18.291
And then what?

13:18.375 --> 13:20.833
We just fade into this town
like everyone else?

13:20.916 --> 13:23.458
No, Aggie. My mom said
I'm supposed to do something important.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.666
Something that matters.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.416
So,

13:26.500 --> 13:28.416
I'm leaving tonight.

13:28.500 --> 13:32.583
Wait, Sophie… you've never even
set foot outside Gavaldon.

13:32.666 --> 13:34.166
You don't even know what's out there.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.125
-None of us really do.
-That's the point.

13:37.208 --> 13:40.208
You know nothing can ever happen for me
as long as I'm stuck here.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.541
I can't settle for an ordinary life.

13:42.625 --> 13:43.458
I won't.

13:51.625 --> 13:52.625
Hey, look.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.208
-Remember?
-Oh!

13:57.291 --> 14:00.083
-Yeah, I found it in my attic last week.
-Oh!

14:00.166 --> 14:03.791
See? You already did
do something that matters.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.375
The day you became my friend.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.416
Please, I can't handle this place
without you.

14:13.666 --> 14:17.583
I'll talk to your mom and dad,
and I'll tell them how unfair this is.

14:18.708 --> 14:21.458
I'll call you Queen Sophie of Gavaldon.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.500
I will even let you give me a makeover.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.125
Just please don't go.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.500
-Okay.
-You promise?

14:33.583 --> 14:35.000
I promise.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.708
-Oh, thank you!
-Oh!

14:53.000 --> 14:55.166
"Queen Sophie of Gavaldon."

14:55.750 --> 14:58.791
<i>It was at that moment Sophie decided</i>

14:58.875 --> 15:03.041
<i>she was beyond wishing</i>
<i>for her life to magically improve.</i>

15:04.000 --> 15:07.125
<i>It was time to take charge of her destiny.</i>

15:07.916 --> 15:14.250
<i>Even if it meant breaking the promise</i>
<i>she'd made to her best and only friend.</i>

15:14.333 --> 15:15.666
I'm so sorry, Aggie.

15:21.791 --> 15:27.166
<i>But some wishes are</i>
<i>simply too powerful to take back.</i>

15:40.958 --> 15:42.875
You were gonna run away after all?

15:42.958 --> 15:44.250
Aggie, I'm sorry.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.583
-What was that?

15:49.625 --> 15:53.916
-The red sky. It's happening.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.125
Sophie.

16:07.041 --> 16:09.000
Hey, we have to get out of here.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.166
-Aggie, this is what I wished for.
-You what?

16:12.666 --> 16:15.416
-Sophie!

16:16.750 --> 16:17.791
Sophie!

16:17.875 --> 16:20.291
-Hold on! I'm coming!

16:20.375 --> 16:22.333
So long, Gavaldon!

16:22.416 --> 16:24.500
Farewell, mediocrity!

16:24.583 --> 16:27.250
-Goodbye, low ambition!

16:27.333 --> 16:29.625
-Aggie, no!

16:29.708 --> 16:31.000
Please let me go!

16:31.083 --> 16:34.708
No way! I'm never letting you go!

16:38.875 --> 16:41.250
-No.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.041
-No.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.000
No, Aggie, what was happening
was a good thing.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.833
I'm sorry, Sophie,
but I… I couldn't take that chance.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.708
I can't let anything bad happen to you.

16:51.791 --> 16:53.000
Yeah, I know.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.916
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

17:14.541 --> 17:16.000
Aggie, this is good.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.833
No, no, no, no! This is not good!

17:17.916 --> 17:19.083
It's okay!

17:39.583 --> 17:40.958
This is it!

17:41.708 --> 17:44.958
-This is real! I was right!

17:45.041 --> 17:47.833
Aggie, look.
That must be the School for Good.

17:47.916 --> 17:49.833
It's so beautiful.

17:50.416 --> 17:51.666
Wait, that means that's--

17:51.750 --> 17:54.625
Oh God, the other one.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.625
Aggie, this is everything
I've ever wanted.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.333
This is not what <i>I </i>wanted!

18:07.416 --> 18:10.708
No, Sophie, we have to get back.
You know my mom can't get by without me.

18:10.791 --> 18:13.625
I'm sure this will take you home
once it drops me at the Good school.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.750
I want it to take us <i>both </i>back!

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
Oh, Aggie!

18:19.791 --> 18:24.125
No! You're supposed to drop <i>me</i>
at the Good school, not <i>her!</i>

18:24.208 --> 18:25.791
No, take me back! Please!

18:25.875 --> 18:28.541
No! You don't understand! I'm Good--

18:49.541 --> 18:52.083
Ah, great. The bird ate my shirt.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.291
Oh wow.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.583
Can I touch your hair?

18:55.666 --> 18:58.208
-Most witches don't have princess hair.

18:58.291 --> 19:01.208
-I bet it smells like cake.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.666
I love cake.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.708
-I'm not a witch!
-Hey! Hey, where are you going?

19:05.791 --> 19:06.833
Oh, come on!

19:06.916 --> 19:08.500
-Help me!

19:10.416 --> 19:11.833
Fall in line, newbie.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.625
-Get over there.

19:13.708 --> 19:15.083
-Oh!

19:17.708 --> 19:20.500
-Sorry.
-Watch it, freak.

19:24.791 --> 19:26.666
Hey, no!

19:26.750 --> 19:30.041
You have to listen to me.
I am <i>not</i> supposed to be here. I'm Good!

19:30.125 --> 19:32.708
God, I hate move-in day.

19:32.791 --> 19:36.208
I'm supposed to be a princess,
not a villain!

19:36.291 --> 19:38.375
-No!

19:52.958 --> 19:55.166
-Ow.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.166
Did she just kill a fairy?

19:57.958 --> 19:59.291
Uh, what?

19:59.375 --> 20:01.708
-Oh.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.458
Ah.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.916
-Son of a--
-Oh dear.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.500
You must be lost.

20:10.583 --> 20:13.041
Yeah.
Yeah, that is an understatement.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.250
-How do I get out of here? I…

20:15.333 --> 20:18.208
Ugh. What the hell is it?

20:18.291 --> 20:19.500
It looks like a witch.

20:19.583 --> 20:20.916
I'm thinking a troll.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.500
I say demon.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.333
Maybe part hunchback?

20:24.416 --> 20:26.541
I don't have a hunch.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.208
Then you really need a tailor.

20:30.125 --> 20:33.125
How do I get over to that school?

20:33.208 --> 20:34.541
I knew from its smell.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.000
It's a Never.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.500
-Just listen!

20:37.583 --> 20:39.458
I just need to find my friend.

20:39.541 --> 20:41.875
Ah, whatever,
the fairies will get rid of her.

20:41.958 --> 20:44.041
-Come, girls.

20:47.791 --> 20:50.375
-Mm.
-What? I'm leaving.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.250
No, no, no. I need--

20:54.875 --> 20:57.958
-Stop doing that!

20:58.041 --> 20:59.125
What are you…?

21:01.291 --> 21:02.708
No, let me go!

21:02.791 --> 21:05.416
Get off of me!

21:19.458 --> 21:21.125
Ta-da!

21:21.208 --> 21:22.500
Me again.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.500
Put her there.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.500
It's cleaner than my own hand.

21:27.583 --> 21:28.500
Trust me.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.041
-I'm Hort, by the way.
-Hort?

21:30.125 --> 21:31.791
That sounds like something you cough up.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.833
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

21:34.916 --> 21:36.291
Weirdo.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.166
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.208
You seem to be in charge,
and I am in the wrong school.

21:41.291 --> 21:44.208
Ooh! How distressful. And improbable.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.000
-Back up. Your name?

21:46.083 --> 21:48.625
Actually, you know what? I wanna guess it.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.625
You won't know it.

21:49.708 --> 21:50.791
Mm, Sophie.

21:51.958 --> 21:52.958
Of Gavaldon.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.125
Did I guess it?

21:55.208 --> 21:57.125
-I always do.
-There must be a mistake.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.625
-I clear--
-You're the Reader.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.791
-I read, if that's what you mean.
-Shh, shh, shh. It's not.

22:01.875 --> 22:05.541
Every so often,
a very lucky candidate from the outside

22:05.625 --> 22:09.625
is selected for admission
to this hallowed institution.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.708
We call them… Readers

22:13.500 --> 22:17.416
because they only get to read
about the amazing adventures

22:17.500 --> 22:18.625
that originate here.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.833
-Now, please, excuse me.

22:21.416 --> 22:23.916
I have fresh villainy to attend to.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.458
Showtime!

22:26.541 --> 22:29.333
-Attention!

22:29.416 --> 22:31.166
-Attention, future Evil!

22:32.000 --> 22:34.541
If you open your
tiny little bloodshot eyes,

22:34.625 --> 22:39.458
you'll find your dormitory
and class schedules around the hall.

22:39.541 --> 22:43.083
It would serve you well to memorize both.

22:43.666 --> 22:44.666
Make me proud.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.166
Oh my God.

23:06.083 --> 23:07.875
Don't you ever touch me again.

23:09.625 --> 23:11.750
-All right! Okay.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.541
I thought fairies were
supposed to be nice.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.625
Oh, I must be in hell.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.541
Ugh.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.541
Well, this is hell, all right.

23:35.916 --> 23:36.916
What…?

23:41.458 --> 23:44.541
-Holy sh--
-Well, hello.

23:44.625 --> 23:48.958
I see you found the Groom Room.

23:49.041 --> 23:51.666
Well done, Agatha of Gavaldon.

23:51.750 --> 23:54.916
Might I suggest
you clean up a bit before orientation?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.375
Or perhaps clean up a lot.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.333
How do you know my name?

23:59.416 --> 24:01.500
Because I've been expecting you.

24:01.583 --> 24:06.791
I am Professor Dovey,
here to help however I can.

24:06.875 --> 24:09.125
Finally. My friend Sophie
wanted to be here.

24:09.208 --> 24:11.000
-The Never? No.
-The what?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.666
Your friend is a Never.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.166
You are an Ever.

24:16.250 --> 24:22.041
Ever, because we believe
in living happily ever after.

24:22.125 --> 24:25.208
Nevers, because they don't.

24:25.291 --> 24:28.500
School for Evil, School for Good.

24:28.583 --> 24:31.916
-Evil--
-Yup, okay, I got it.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.458
-But clearly, there's been a mistake.
-Hmm?

24:34.541 --> 24:35.583
I mean, look at me.

24:35.666 --> 24:41.166
My dear,
one doesn't measure one's goodness

24:41.250 --> 24:43.166
just by how one looks.

24:43.250 --> 24:46.666
-No, it's about what one does.

24:46.750 --> 24:50.250
If you're here,
you must have great… power.

24:51.125 --> 24:52.791
Trust me, I don't.

24:53.500 --> 24:59.958
Well then, I bet you just need
to learn to summon it.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.625
<i>Feel </i>it.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.666
Because magic follows emotion.

25:04.750 --> 25:08.291
The stronger the emotion,
the more powerful the magic.

25:08.375 --> 25:11.375
-Summon enough passion,

25:11.875 --> 25:16.208
and you can accomplish anything.

25:19.375 --> 25:20.375
For you.

25:21.541 --> 25:23.583
-How did you do that?
-I just told you.

25:32.083 --> 25:33.958
-Okay.
-Yes.

25:34.625 --> 25:36.666
Thank you so much for the show.

25:37.375 --> 25:40.541
Um, have fun with your magic tricks, lady.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.916
I've gotta find my friend
and get back to Gavaldon.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.083
Stop!

25:46.750 --> 25:49.583
Look, if there was a mistake,

25:49.666 --> 25:52.791
then it is one
that <i>someone</i> is going to get fired for.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.541
-Literally.

25:54.625 --> 26:00.166
So, let's pretend there is not a mistake
until we can sort this all out, yes?

26:02.250 --> 26:06.000
Besides, there is no way back.

26:06.083 --> 26:06.916
Wait, what?

26:07.000 --> 26:12.208
Oh, I know! Let's get you
in your armor.

26:12.291 --> 26:14.625
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

26:14.708 --> 26:19.041
-Oh, yes! Look at them!

26:21.083 --> 26:23.333
Let me guess.
You're not a pink person?

26:23.416 --> 26:24.750
Not a problem!

26:24.833 --> 26:29.125
We also have rose, fuchsia, blush,

26:29.208 --> 26:31.000
watermelon, hibiscus.

26:31.083 --> 26:32.791
So many colors!

26:32.875 --> 26:34.916
-I just love my job.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.875
-Wait, Sophie!
-Aggie!

26:55.958 --> 26:57.541
-Hey!
-Hey!

26:59.166 --> 27:00.541
They gave you a gown?

27:00.625 --> 27:03.375
-Sit down and shut up, Reader!

27:03.458 --> 27:04.500
Wait.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.791
-Come on.

27:06.875 --> 27:07.875
Okay.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.250
And stay there!

27:10.333 --> 27:11.291
Hey.

27:11.375 --> 27:12.333
Me again.

27:13.416 --> 27:14.708
-Oh my God.

27:14.791 --> 27:16.041
-Excuse me.

27:16.125 --> 27:18.250
My father tells me not to talk to Readers.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.875
He says they're bad luck.

27:19.958 --> 27:21.875
You've probably read about my father.

27:21.958 --> 27:22.833
Captain Hook?

27:23.500 --> 27:25.625
He's got a pretty awesome ship.

27:26.625 --> 27:29.458
-Do you want a bite? It's nice and putrid.

27:34.916 --> 27:36.458
Grace and beauty first?

27:36.541 --> 27:39.416
-Oh, if you insist, Clarissa.
-So glad you agree.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.583
-Welcome, first-year students!

27:43.666 --> 27:45.791
I am Professor Dovey,

27:45.875 --> 27:48.125
Dean of the School for Good.

27:48.208 --> 27:52.125
Evers!
Evers! Evers! Evers! Evers!

27:52.208 --> 27:56.875
And I'm Lady Lesso,
Dean of the School for Evil.

27:56.958 --> 28:00.958
Kill you!
Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! Kill you!

28:01.041 --> 28:04.666
-There's no boys in the School for Good?
-Ugh, there's plenty.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.250
And get ready to be nauseous.

28:07.750 --> 28:11.541
As per tradition,
the winning school from last year…

28:11.625 --> 28:13.541
Us again. Imagine that!

28:13.625 --> 28:15.958
-Hmm. Imagine.
-…will now grace us all

28:16.041 --> 28:19.666
with a display
of their chivalrous talents.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.791
-Ugh.
-Gentlemen!

28:37.458 --> 28:39.875
What a bunch of losers.

28:40.708 --> 28:41.750
Oh my.

29:04.833 --> 29:07.208
-Aren't they wonderful?

29:16.958 --> 29:19.208
-Oh.

29:21.125 --> 29:25.708
If you boys are finished with dance class,
maybe you'd like to have a real fight.

29:25.791 --> 29:27.458
Oh no.

29:27.541 --> 29:29.125
What do you say?

29:35.083 --> 29:38.958
-Who… is… that?

29:39.041 --> 29:40.625
It's Tedros!

29:40.708 --> 29:42.250
His dad was king,

29:42.333 --> 29:45.041
so of course
he has to have his own stupid entrance.

29:51.291 --> 29:54.000
You know what? Let's make it easy for you.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.583
Charge!

30:04.750 --> 30:06.416
Yes!

30:10.791 --> 30:14.666
I don't know what the big deal
about owning a round table is, anyway.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.083
His father was King Arthur?

30:16.166 --> 30:19.041
-Yawn.
-Wow.

30:22.333 --> 30:25.791
-He…

30:33.708 --> 30:35.125
-Nice work, fellas.

30:35.208 --> 30:38.125
Let's see how you do
in a real fight, pretty boy.

30:39.041 --> 30:40.916
Prepare to die.

30:45.333 --> 30:47.291
Get him! Get him!

30:50.000 --> 30:51.541
-Huh?
-Mm.

30:52.291 --> 30:54.375
Oh, come on.

30:54.458 --> 30:57.166
If we're gonna do this,
we might as well do it right.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.500
Ugh.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.083
-Yes, yes, yes!

31:13.875 --> 31:15.916
Oh, come on! Foul!

31:16.000 --> 31:18.083
Anybody! He's got a magical sword.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.833
How's that fair?

31:19.916 --> 31:21.291
That's Excalibur.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.708
Really?

31:29.791 --> 31:32.291
I know. How evil of me.

32:20.791 --> 32:21.916
Come on!

32:27.250 --> 32:28.083
Dammit.

32:28.750 --> 32:31.500
Oh, how <i>good </i>of you to lose again.

32:32.875 --> 32:35.916
Bravo! Bravo!

32:36.000 --> 32:38.958
-A heroic display!

32:40.375 --> 32:42.291
Look--

32:44.916 --> 32:46.125
Uh…

32:52.083 --> 32:56.500
-Excuse me, milady. I believe, uh--
-That I don't belong here? Yeah, I know.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.125
Don't want your stupid rose anyway.

32:58.208 --> 33:01.375
Oh, and by the way,
this is what a normal girl looks like.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.625
He intended it for me.

33:04.708 --> 33:05.708
Normal girl.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.250
There's an open seat next to me, Teddy.

33:12.083 --> 33:16.583
And, for the record, you don't know
what I was about to say, but…

33:17.250 --> 33:18.208
nice try.

33:24.708 --> 33:25.875
What did he smell like?

33:27.083 --> 33:28.083
Ego.

33:30.541 --> 33:35.583
In these two schools,
we will take away any confusion

33:35.666 --> 33:40.208
and make your souls as pure as possible.

33:40.791 --> 33:42.458
Pure Good.

33:42.541 --> 33:44.375
Or pure Evil.

33:44.458 --> 33:49.000
Future heroes and villains,
you have been chosen

33:49.083 --> 33:51.208
to protect and maintain

33:51.291 --> 33:54.041
the balance between Good and Evil.

33:54.125 --> 33:57.208
For if that balance is ever compromised--

33:57.291 --> 34:00.791
I don't think we need to get into that
just now with our new friends, do we?

34:00.875 --> 34:04.333
-It's such a happy first day.

34:04.416 --> 34:06.500
-Let's not be downers, hmm?

34:06.583 --> 34:12.000
Besides, I'm sure this new class
will perform exceptionally well.

34:12.083 --> 34:16.541
And like your parents before you,
you are all here because

34:16.625 --> 34:20.416
the world of story needs
great heroes and villains

34:20.500 --> 34:23.708
to teach the people of the outside world

34:23.791 --> 34:25.958
to make choices to find their way.

34:26.041 --> 34:29.916
So, obey the rules,
study hard, and remember,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.416
the Storian only chooses
the very best of our students

34:33.500 --> 34:34.625
for their own adventure.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.916
But what if we've been dropped
in the wrong school?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.500
Or there's been a mistake
and we need to go home immediately?

34:43.791 --> 34:48.750
There are no mistakes
in the School for Good and Evil,

34:48.833 --> 34:49.875
so…

34:50.833 --> 34:52.000
have a nice semester.

34:59.083 --> 35:03.458
<i>All students,</i>
<i>report to your assigned sleeping quarters.</i>

35:03.541 --> 35:04.916
-Perfect.

35:08.083 --> 35:10.000
The Good do not room with Evil.

35:11.208 --> 35:12.791
-Reena…
-Hmm?

35:12.875 --> 35:14.541
Tell the fairies to come get my bags.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.125
-I'm moving.

35:18.625 --> 35:21.208
Mm, but I'll miss you so.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.958
Try not to ruin anything.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.083
Sweet dreams, Never.

35:39.666 --> 35:40.833
-Hey!

35:40.916 --> 35:43.250
-No, no, no! No, you don't understand!

35:43.333 --> 35:45.250
I need to find my friend!

35:57.083 --> 35:58.416
Whoa.

36:09.666 --> 36:12.333
Ugh, I told you we'd get her.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.333
Let me guess.

36:15.208 --> 36:16.916
-It's Belle.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.375
Or Anastasia. Or Sugar Plum.

36:20.458 --> 36:23.833
-Actually, my name is Sophie.

36:28.166 --> 36:30.375
-Ah!
-You two have no manners.

36:30.458 --> 36:32.000
Welcome to room 66.

36:32.083 --> 36:34.500
I'm Dot, daughter of Robert de Rainault.

36:34.583 --> 36:37.916
-Robert…
-Hello? The Sheriff of Nottingham.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.250
It's okay. He's not, like, super famous.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.791
Yeah, who's ever heard of Robin Hood?

36:43.875 --> 36:46.791
-Learn your history, cream puff.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.041
Anyway, that's Anadil.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.541
-And that ray of sunshine is Hester.

36:53.625 --> 36:56.333
-You can bunk next to me, Sophie.

36:56.916 --> 36:59.083
That's a funny name for a villain.

36:59.166 --> 37:00.958
-Oh, please.

37:01.041 --> 37:03.833
-She's <i>so</i> not a villain.
-Of course I'm not.

37:03.916 --> 37:05.250
Look at me.

37:05.333 --> 37:07.083
Do I look like a witch?

37:07.166 --> 37:08.458
Or a troll?

37:08.541 --> 37:10.583
Or some disgusting old hag?

37:24.750 --> 37:25.666
That hag

37:27.166 --> 37:28.166
is my mother.

37:39.375 --> 37:41.750
Okay, eyes up, Agatha.

37:44.791 --> 37:47.333
It's just a Cupid, stupid.

37:47.416 --> 37:49.125
Okay, don't be lame.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.333
Don't be lame.

37:51.416 --> 37:52.583
You got this.

37:52.666 --> 37:54.208
Phew. Okay.

37:55.416 --> 37:56.750
Okay.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.250
Oh.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.250
Uh, hi.

38:08.708 --> 38:11.250
Students aren't allowed on the ledge.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.583
Prepare for punishment!

38:31.666 --> 38:35.083
-And I thought Gavaldon was bad.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.500
All right, princess.

38:41.583 --> 38:44.208
What's so important
we had to trek all the way up here?

38:44.291 --> 38:45.625
I'm in heels, you know.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.500
-It's the Readers.

38:47.583 --> 38:51.375
And their insistence
that they shouldn't be where they are.

38:51.458 --> 38:54.291
-And something does feel <i>wrong.</i>

38:54.375 --> 38:56.666
The only thing that feels wrong

38:56.750 --> 39:00.208
is the School Master's decision
to bring them here in the first place.

39:00.291 --> 39:01.916
What if he did make a mistake?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.333
What if he dropped them
in the wrong schools

39:04.416 --> 39:06.125
and something terrible happens?

39:06.208 --> 39:07.583
He'd never admit it.

39:07.666 --> 39:12.000
He'd blame one of us to save face,
and you know what would happen then.

39:14.250 --> 39:17.666
There is no mistake.
Besides, I'd think you'd be happy.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.708
I'm stuck with yet another underachiever.

39:20.791 --> 39:22.500
Sophie of Gavaldon.

39:22.583 --> 39:24.541
What? What? No. Whatever do you mean?

39:24.625 --> 39:26.166
Pfft. Please.

39:26.250 --> 39:29.083
Evil hasn't won anything
in over 200 years.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.833
Well, you've come close a couple of times.

39:30.916 --> 39:33.333
Close doesn't cut it!

39:33.416 --> 39:34.375
Ugh!

39:34.458 --> 39:37.000
I just have to work my students
twice as hard.

39:37.083 --> 39:37.958
Mm.

39:38.041 --> 39:40.958
Because a world
where Evil is not as powerful as Good

39:41.041 --> 39:43.125
is a world out of balance.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.000
Now, if you'll excuse me…

39:45.833 --> 39:47.583
…I have a lot of work to do.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.500
Lesso!

40:27.166 --> 40:29.958
Stay away from Sophie,
little witch.

40:30.041 --> 40:32.541
-She has a destiny to fulfill.

40:32.625 --> 40:34.875
And she belongs to me now.

40:58.166 --> 40:59.791
Where are you, Sophie?

41:30.458 --> 41:32.583
I'm sure your mother's beautiful
on the inside.

41:32.666 --> 41:34.666
-I have to get to the other school.

41:34.750 --> 41:36.916
-I'm Good.
-Yeah, at disguising your Evil.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.208
I am <i>not </i>Evil.

41:38.291 --> 41:40.208
Let's settle this with science.

41:40.291 --> 41:42.333
-Oh my--

41:42.416 --> 41:45.041
If she's Good,
the fairies will catch her when she falls.

41:45.125 --> 41:49.333
But if she smashes on the rocks
in a gruesome, skull-splintering death,

41:49.416 --> 41:51.125
she's Evil.

41:51.208 --> 41:53.541
The second one. Do the second one.

41:53.625 --> 41:56.083
But she <i>is </i>a villain.
She just doesn't know it yet.

41:56.166 --> 41:57.708
No, I'm Good!

41:57.791 --> 41:59.750
Aw, she whines like an Ever.

41:59.833 --> 42:02.500
Smells like an Ever.

42:02.583 --> 42:04.875
-Has hair like an Ever.

42:04.958 --> 42:05.791
Or <i>had.</i>

42:05.875 --> 42:06.833
Hey!

42:06.916 --> 42:08.541
Not the hair!

42:14.250 --> 42:17.583
You want proof that I'm Good?
Then get a mirror, and look in it.

42:17.666 --> 42:18.791
You hag!

42:19.791 --> 42:21.833
Told ya. Definitely Evil.

42:21.916 --> 42:24.541
-Sophie!
-Aggie!

42:30.500 --> 42:33.375
-Aggie, hey.

42:33.458 --> 42:36.291
-Come on.
-Wait, where are we going?

42:36.375 --> 42:37.666
To get you out of here.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.791
-Oh, good.
-Not good.

42:39.875 --> 42:42.375
Some… thing is after you.

42:42.458 --> 42:43.458
I saw it.

42:44.875 --> 42:47.833
Okay. So we're ending this now.

42:48.875 --> 42:50.291
Aggie, no! It's not worth it!

42:53.208 --> 42:56.750
-Come on.
-<i>Agatha's plan was simple.</i>

42:56.833 --> 42:58.250
<i>Find the School Master</i>

42:58.333 --> 43:02.041
<i>and plead their case</i>
<i>to leave the school directly to him.</i>

43:02.666 --> 43:05.333
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

43:06.041 --> 43:07.125
How do we get in?

43:07.208 --> 43:09.666
He definitely came up here.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.458
I saw it.

43:12.416 --> 43:14.666
Hey! Let us in!

43:15.541 --> 43:17.291
Great.

43:18.208 --> 43:19.583
Now we're stuck up here.

43:26.125 --> 43:28.083
<i>Would they be prepared</i>

43:28.166 --> 43:30.666
<i>for what awaited them in the shadows?</i>

43:31.333 --> 43:33.416
<i>Agatha called into the darkness.</i>

43:33.500 --> 43:34.625
Hello?

43:34.708 --> 43:37.041
-<i>But there was no response.</i>

43:37.125 --> 43:38.166
Who is that?

43:38.250 --> 43:41.666
<i>Sophie discovered</i>
<i>that books lined the walls,</i>

43:41.750 --> 43:45.375
<i>filled with stories</i>
<i>from every corner of the world.</i>

43:45.458 --> 43:48.916
-You know we hear you narrating, weirdo.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.333
If you're trying to scare us,
it's not working.

43:51.416 --> 43:53.958
<i>The girls heard</i>
<i>a scratching in the blackness.</i>

43:54.041 --> 43:55.583
<i>They moved warily toward it.</i>

43:55.666 --> 43:57.500
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

43:57.583 --> 43:59.875
-All of that, and it's a dumb pen?

43:59.958 --> 44:00.791
Sophie, stop!

44:00.875 --> 44:02.791
-Don't touch!

44:05.041 --> 44:07.250
You know, no students
have ever made it into my tower.

44:07.333 --> 44:09.041
I knew you were special.

44:09.791 --> 44:13.541
The Storian began writing your story
before you even arrived.

44:13.625 --> 44:18.666
Guess that's why I'm so confused
as to why the two of you want to leave.

44:18.750 --> 44:20.958
<i>She </i>wants to leave. I don't.

44:21.041 --> 44:23.208
Sophie, I have to get you out of here.

44:23.291 --> 44:27.375
Ahem. Ladies, ladies. I can assure you,
you are both perfectly safe here.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.458
We pride ourselves
on protecting our Readers.

44:29.541 --> 44:32.250
Really? Then what about
the spinning tower of blood

44:32.333 --> 44:34.291
I just saw obsessing over Sophie?

44:34.375 --> 44:36.833
Well, my friend, you see,
there are so many random spirits

44:36.916 --> 44:40.125
and personalized spells flying
around this school, even I can't keep up.

44:40.208 --> 44:41.750
Well, I think she's in danger.

44:41.833 --> 44:44.625
So, unfortunately,
we can't just languish here

44:44.708 --> 44:48.291
while you train us
to be in some silly fairy tales.

44:48.375 --> 44:52.500
Our graduates live the very real events
that change the world,

44:52.583 --> 44:56.625
which become the stories
that change the world.

44:56.708 --> 44:59.041
You're trying to tell me that Snow White

44:59.125 --> 45:03.041
and Cinderella
and Jack and the Beanstalk were real?

45:03.125 --> 45:05.416
As were Hercules

45:06.291 --> 45:08.291
and Sinbad

45:09.250 --> 45:11.583
and El Cid

45:12.500 --> 45:16.458
and all the others
who have battled the forces of Evil.

45:16.541 --> 45:19.583
We teach you how to fulfill your destiny.

45:19.666 --> 45:23.416
And that's exactly what I wanna learn,
but you put me in the wrong school.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.208
I'm supposed to be in Good.

45:25.875 --> 45:27.125
You made a mistake.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.541
-Hmm.
-Sir.

45:29.625 --> 45:33.291
Well, perhaps I have.
But I'll need you to prove it.

45:33.375 --> 45:34.750
Why, if it's your mistake?

45:34.833 --> 45:39.958
Because once something
is written by the Storian,

45:40.041 --> 45:42.583
only the Storian can change its course.

45:42.666 --> 45:43.875
This is ridiculous.

45:43.958 --> 45:47.875
How are we supposed to change its mind,
if it even has one?

45:47.958 --> 45:50.125
Oh, but it does.

45:50.208 --> 45:52.208
And there's only one way, really.

45:52.708 --> 45:55.583
What is the one thing
that Evil can never have

45:56.208 --> 45:57.916
that Good can never do without?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.750
Oh, I know. Manners.

45:59.833 --> 46:01.166
A castle.

46:01.250 --> 46:02.958
Amazing hair. A horse.

46:03.041 --> 46:04.041
Mm.

46:04.125 --> 46:05.416
True love.

46:05.500 --> 46:09.500
Which is
traditionally manifested in a kiss.

46:09.583 --> 46:10.583
So you're saying…

46:11.625 --> 46:13.708
I can't believe I'm actually saying this.

46:13.791 --> 46:16.375
If Sophie were
to kiss her true love,

46:16.458 --> 46:19.541
that would prove to Quilly over there
that you were wrong about us?

46:19.625 --> 46:25.333
If one from School of Evil
won true love's kiss,

46:26.416 --> 46:28.416
it would change everything.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.000
And I could stay and switch schools?

46:30.083 --> 46:31.375
Sophie.

46:32.416 --> 46:35.291
This is all I've ever wanted, Aggie.
I can't go back to Gavaldon.

46:35.375 --> 46:36.666
Not to my old life.

46:36.750 --> 46:38.541
I will never get this chance again.

46:39.583 --> 46:41.250
Please, let me do this.

46:42.416 --> 46:44.791
-I'll think about it.
-Excellent.

46:44.875 --> 46:49.416
Well, I guess somebody
better go find herself a prince to kiss.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.958
But remember, dear Reader,

46:52.041 --> 46:55.916
no kiss comes without its price.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.041
-Wait, what does that mean?

47:00.916 --> 47:03.583
-<i>Good morning, darlings!</i>

47:03.666 --> 47:05.291
<i>Rise and shine!</i>

47:05.375 --> 47:10.833
<i>The first event of the semester,</i>
<i>the Evers Ball, is only two weeks away,</i>

47:10.916 --> 47:12.708
<i>and you've got a lot to learn.</i>

47:12.791 --> 47:14.916
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.458
Good morning, Agatha.

47:19.333 --> 47:22.791
-<i>Wake up, despicables!</i>

47:39.750 --> 47:41.291
Psst.

47:41.375 --> 47:42.458
Who's that?

47:42.541 --> 47:44.666
-Dark… Dark hair.
-Tristan.

47:44.750 --> 47:46.333
I caught his rose.

47:46.416 --> 47:48.291
I hope he invites me to the Evers Ball.

47:48.375 --> 47:50.833
You have to get a boy to ask you,
or you fail.

47:50.916 --> 47:52.583
And you do not want to fail.

47:52.666 --> 47:54.750
Three fails, and you're expelled.

47:54.833 --> 47:56.916
-Wait, you mean they kick you out?
-Uh…

47:57.000 --> 47:58.333
No.

47:58.416 --> 48:00.833
They actually turn you
into something else.

48:00.916 --> 48:03.416
Like a talking tea kettle

48:04.083 --> 48:06.333
or a mouse or something much worse.

48:06.416 --> 48:09.416
Wait, like forever? What?

48:09.500 --> 48:11.500
Uglify!

48:12.250 --> 48:16.416
-Why do we need to be ugly?

48:16.916 --> 48:19.375
-Hort! Wake up!

48:19.458 --> 48:22.208
Oh, because it makes little children cry.

48:22.291 --> 48:23.291
Wrong.

48:23.375 --> 48:25.375
-That's merely a bonus.

48:25.458 --> 48:26.375
Ah.

48:26.458 --> 48:32.000
Why be revolting and repugnant?

48:32.083 --> 48:34.083
My question exactly.

48:34.166 --> 48:36.583
Ah, not caring how you look

48:36.666 --> 48:41.666
forces you to use your intelligence.

48:41.750 --> 48:45.208
Ugliness is freedom!

48:51.708 --> 48:55.333
My tooth just fell out.

48:56.166 --> 48:57.750
It's disgusting.

48:57.833 --> 49:00.166
And I don't care.

49:00.250 --> 49:03.541
And that is power!

49:06.208 --> 49:08.166
-Bring it down, girls.

49:08.250 --> 49:11.875
-I am Professor Anemone,

49:11.958 --> 49:17.250
and I am here to show you
how to become a truly powerful woman

49:17.333 --> 49:19.208
through beauty.

49:21.166 --> 49:24.208
A lady's smile is a sword

49:24.291 --> 49:28.708
in the battle for life and for true love.

49:28.791 --> 49:32.666
-So, pick up your mirrors…

49:33.666 --> 49:35.125
…and strike!

49:35.208 --> 49:38.375
-Lovely, Reena.
-Thank you, Professor.

49:38.458 --> 49:41.750
Exquisite, Beatrix.

49:44.666 --> 49:47.583
I'm sorry. This just feels so wrong.

49:47.666 --> 49:50.250
Smiling? That's how you're empowering us?

49:50.333 --> 49:56.041
Smiling is a strict requirement
for passing this course.

49:56.125 --> 50:00.916
So, show me your smile
if you don't want to fail.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.958
My… smile?

50:03.041 --> 50:04.333
Mm-hmm.

50:07.291 --> 50:09.625
-I don't feel safe.
-Mm-hmm.

50:19.666 --> 50:21.541
Wait. What is that?

50:22.125 --> 50:24.208
A fail, Reader.

50:24.708 --> 50:27.416
Wait, you're… you're failing me
for being a bad smiler?

50:28.416 --> 50:31.083
-Yeah. Let's get to work.

50:31.166 --> 50:34.208
Ah, now, prepare to drink up

50:34.291 --> 50:39.750
and see how ugly and powerful you can be.

50:39.833 --> 50:42.125
-Reader.

50:45.958 --> 50:47.208
You're first.

50:47.291 --> 50:49.583
No. I don't want to be ugly.

50:49.666 --> 50:51.416
-It's not who I am.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.083
Not yet. Hort!

50:54.166 --> 50:56.166
Uh, yes, sir, Professor Manley.

50:56.250 --> 50:57.833
Sorry about this.

50:57.916 --> 51:01.083
But don't worry.
You'll still look beautiful to me.

51:19.583 --> 51:21.708
It's, um, Agatha, right?

51:21.791 --> 51:23.875
-Hi.
-Do you mind if I sit with you?

51:23.958 --> 51:25.458
-No.
-Great.

51:25.541 --> 51:27.625
-If you want to.
-Uh…

51:30.291 --> 51:31.291
I'm Gregor.

51:31.375 --> 51:33.458
Um, Gregor Charming.

51:33.541 --> 51:35.500
The, uh… the prince's son.

51:35.583 --> 51:37.416
I'll try not to be
too charming.

51:37.500 --> 51:39.708
-I'm Agatha.
-I heard you don't want to be here.

51:39.791 --> 51:42.083
Well, I don't either.

51:42.166 --> 51:45.583
-You don't?
-I'm not cut out to be a prince.

51:45.666 --> 51:47.333
It's… It's not who I am.

51:47.416 --> 51:50.458
Do you know what I'd rather do?
Run my own grocery store.

51:50.541 --> 51:52.333
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

51:52.416 --> 51:56.666
I love food, but I wouldn't sell meat
'cause I can't stand the sight of blood.

51:56.750 --> 51:59.666
That's actually why I got a fail today.
I got nicked in a duel.

52:01.083 --> 52:03.125
I'm sorry,
they failed you for one tiny cut?

52:03.208 --> 52:04.791
Not quite.

52:05.708 --> 52:08.666
I saw the blood,
and I passed out in my heavy armor.

52:10.541 --> 52:12.000
I was on top of a hill,

52:12.500 --> 52:14.000
and so I started rolling down,

52:15.666 --> 52:17.541
knocking over everyone in my path.

52:20.500 --> 52:23.291
-Definitely grocery-store material, right?

52:23.375 --> 52:26.000
I think you should do
whatever makes you happiest, Gregor.

52:29.083 --> 52:31.500
I'm sorry, Gregor,
will… will you excuse me?

52:31.583 --> 52:32.583
Oh, uh…

52:32.666 --> 52:34.666
Sure. See you around, Agatha.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.416
-Thanks.

52:39.666 --> 52:41.666
-Did you get attacked?
-Yes.

52:41.750 --> 52:42.875
By tadpoles.

52:43.791 --> 52:45.416
In ugly class.

52:45.500 --> 52:47.708
Well, I failed beauty class.

52:47.791 --> 52:49.000
What part did you fail?

52:49.083 --> 52:50.291
Smiling.

52:50.375 --> 52:51.250
Smiling?

52:51.333 --> 52:53.916
Forget it. I found you a prince to kiss.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.625
I already found my true love.

52:55.708 --> 52:57.666
-Tedros.

52:57.750 --> 53:00.458
We had a connection
from the moment we saw each other.

53:01.041 --> 53:02.791
Plus, we just make sense, aesthetically.

53:02.875 --> 53:05.166
Well, unfortunately,
Beatrix already has him.

53:05.250 --> 53:06.833
You think she's prettier than me?

53:06.916 --> 53:10.375
I'm just saying
we need someone who's available now.

53:10.458 --> 53:12.291
School Master said
it had to be true love's kiss.

53:12.375 --> 53:14.125
Sophie, a kiss is a kiss.

53:14.208 --> 53:15.208
Oh, really?

53:17.291 --> 53:18.291
Oh.

53:19.916 --> 53:21.791
See? Nothing happened.

53:22.291 --> 53:23.333
Has to be true love.

53:23.416 --> 53:25.000
I'm okay to keep this casual.

53:25.083 --> 53:26.791
Aren't you sweet?

53:30.083 --> 53:33.083
Just give him this,
and tell him how good and kind I am.

53:33.166 --> 53:34.458
Oh!

53:35.041 --> 53:36.750
And don't be weird.

53:38.125 --> 53:39.458
You know what I mean.

53:39.541 --> 53:41.250
Don't talk about your cat.

53:43.250 --> 53:44.458
-Fine.
-Fine.

53:45.250 --> 53:46.625
Just get him interested.

53:47.291 --> 53:48.375
I'll handle the rest.

54:08.708 --> 54:09.833
Get off me!

54:17.583 --> 54:19.250
-Who are you?

54:19.333 --> 54:22.541
I am the Gnome of the Blue Forest.

54:22.625 --> 54:24.833
But I thought gnomes
were supposed to be short.

54:24.916 --> 54:27.416
I thought princesses
were supposed to be likable.

54:28.208 --> 54:30.500
Welcome, students! Gather round.

54:30.583 --> 54:34.041
I need you all to sign in
so I know who survived and who hasn't.

54:34.125 --> 54:36.208
Hey. Normal girl.

54:36.916 --> 54:38.458
How's the mind reading coming along?

54:38.541 --> 54:41.875
Uh… Oh.

54:41.958 --> 54:45.416
Yeah. No. Sorry about that. That was…

54:45.500 --> 54:48.166
I was just really overwhelmed
when I first got here.

54:48.958 --> 54:52.125
-Yeah. This place can be overwhelming.
-Mm.

54:52.208 --> 54:55.000
Never had a princess
cop an attitude like that before, though.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.208
Really is quite impressive.

54:56.291 --> 54:58.750
Mm, do they usually all smile
and bat their eyes at you?

54:58.833 --> 55:04.458
Yes, they do, which is incredibly boring,
so thank you for not being boring.

55:05.208 --> 55:07.708
Uh, no, I'm actually, uh, pretty boring.

55:08.208 --> 55:10.250
The only person
who doesn't think so is my cat.

55:12.375 --> 55:13.958
Mm, no, I…

55:14.041 --> 55:16.791
Well, they say, uh,
cats are good judges of character.

55:17.875 --> 55:19.500
-They do?
-They will.

55:20.958 --> 55:23.000
Now that I've said it.

55:23.083 --> 55:24.791
I'm quite famous here, you know.

55:24.875 --> 55:26.791
-Number one fairy-tale prince and all.

55:26.875 --> 55:28.833
Yeah, I think…
I think when you become king,

55:28.916 --> 55:31.375
they're probably gonna have to
find a bigger crown

55:31.458 --> 55:33.250
to fit on that swelled head of yours.

55:35.833 --> 55:36.833
Um…

55:39.750 --> 55:41.875
-Nice. Nice.

55:44.291 --> 55:45.291
Uh…

55:47.958 --> 55:48.958
Um…

55:50.541 --> 55:51.458
This is for you.

55:52.291 --> 55:53.791
-Yeah?
-Not from me.

55:53.875 --> 55:55.291
From my friend, Sophie.

55:55.375 --> 55:57.833
Oh, the… the witch with the gorgeous hair?

55:58.541 --> 56:02.083
No, no. She's not a witch.
She was just dropped in the wrong school.

56:02.166 --> 56:05.000
No, that does not happen, normal girl.
She's definitely playing you.

56:05.083 --> 56:07.416
Well, in this case, it did.

56:07.500 --> 56:10.958
Trust me. She is… definitely a princess.

56:12.625 --> 56:14.500
My name is Agatha, by the way.

56:15.083 --> 56:16.083
Agatha.

56:16.916 --> 56:17.916
Much better.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.333
'Cause you're definitely not normal.

56:21.666 --> 56:22.500
In a good way.

56:22.583 --> 56:25.458
All right, come on, everybody!
Come on, gather round.

56:25.541 --> 56:27.250
-Let's can the balloon juice.

56:27.333 --> 56:29.458
-Hmm?

56:30.250 --> 56:34.333
I am Yuba,
the school woods survival expert.

56:34.416 --> 56:37.541
I've lived in them for hundreds of years,
and I haven't died once.

56:38.125 --> 56:39.458
At least…

56:39.541 --> 56:41.750
…not that I can remember.

56:44.333 --> 56:48.208
Oh! That's just a little gnome humor.

56:48.291 --> 56:50.833
So, off we jolly well go.

56:50.916 --> 56:52.666
All right, let's get these doors open.

56:52.750 --> 56:53.750
Go on.

56:54.458 --> 56:55.583
Open!

57:00.125 --> 57:01.208
Open.

57:03.291 --> 57:06.083
Open the forest doors!

57:06.166 --> 57:07.458
Thank you.

57:07.541 --> 57:09.458
-Follow me, everybody!

57:09.541 --> 57:13.500
You cannot survive any adventure
if you cannot survive the woods.

57:14.583 --> 57:19.500
The Blue Forest prepares students
for any perils you may face.

57:19.583 --> 57:20.416
Hey.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.500
Oh, uh…

57:22.583 --> 57:23.416
Hi.

57:23.500 --> 57:25.375
Gregor, what happened to your forehead?

57:26.416 --> 57:28.708
I failed, uh, steed-riding this morning.

57:28.791 --> 57:30.083
-Gregor!

57:30.166 --> 57:32.333
Turns out I'm not really any good
with horses.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.541
And I think I might need glasses.

57:38.291 --> 57:40.416
That grocery store's
looking better and better, right?

57:40.500 --> 57:43.000
-Stay away from Tedros, you goon.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.333
-He's mine.

57:48.500 --> 57:49.416
Oops.

57:50.416 --> 57:51.458
Hey there.

57:51.541 --> 57:52.833
Come on!

57:53.583 --> 57:56.208
A field of pretty pansies,

57:56.291 --> 57:59.500
but as we know from our fairy tales,

57:59.583 --> 58:03.375
pretty can sometimes kill you.

58:07.791 --> 58:10.666
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

58:13.208 --> 58:14.916
Cheeky plant.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.208
That's, uh… That's one bouquet
you wouldn't want to catch at a wedding.

58:23.541 --> 58:24.375
Gnome humor.

58:25.125 --> 58:26.125
Right.

58:30.583 --> 58:31.958
It's okay, Gregor.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.583
It can't get you. You're fine.

58:34.916 --> 58:36.583
I really hate this place.

58:38.791 --> 58:40.500
Quick, quick! Come on.

58:43.291 --> 58:46.750
Ah, this is Yuba's favorite part.

58:46.833 --> 58:48.625
The pumpkin patch.

58:48.708 --> 58:50.875
Benign by day,

58:50.958 --> 58:54.000
but by night, a grisly horror world

58:54.083 --> 58:56.666
where reapers will hunt you down,

58:56.750 --> 58:58.250
drink your blood,

58:58.333 --> 59:01.541
and sell your limbs for spoils!

59:01.625 --> 59:04.416
-Reapers? What are those?

59:04.500 --> 59:05.666
One of those.

59:06.291 --> 59:08.458
That's just a scarecrow.

59:09.833 --> 59:12.875
And I suppose pansies are just flowers.

59:15.791 --> 59:20.250
Remember, only the best Evil
can disguise as Good.

59:23.958 --> 59:25.833
-I've gotta get out of here!
-No, bad idea.

59:25.916 --> 59:27.291
Let go of me!

59:27.375 --> 59:28.208
Gregor, stop!

59:28.291 --> 59:30.208
You've already got two fails!

59:30.291 --> 59:32.083
Gregor! Gregor!

59:32.791 --> 59:35.666
Gregor, you don't know
what they'll do to you!

59:35.750 --> 59:37.666
-Come on, come back!
-I'll be fine!

1:00:04.375 --> 1:00:05.958
Help me!

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:09.666
Agatha!

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:24.583
Gregor?

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:30.541
<i>Every villain has a special talent</i>

1:00:30.625 --> 1:00:33.333
they can hone into a powerful weapon

1:00:33.416 --> 1:00:35.625
to defeat their nemesis.

1:00:35.708 --> 1:00:37.083
What's a nemesis?

1:00:37.166 --> 1:00:38.916
Your archenemy.

1:00:39.791 --> 1:00:45.125
Your story will not end
until one of you is destroyed.

1:00:46.291 --> 1:00:50.291
Now, I want you to dazzle me

1:00:50.375 --> 1:00:53.958
with whatever you believe
your unique talent to be.

1:00:54.041 --> 1:00:56.333
Hort, you're first.

1:00:57.166 --> 1:01:00.958
Well, I've been working on
my werewolf powers in hex class.

1:01:01.041 --> 1:01:02.208
Watch this.

1:01:11.291 --> 1:01:13.333
-Hmm!
-Well done, Hort!

1:01:13.416 --> 1:01:14.416
All right.

1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:18.166
Next time I need
a skinny, one-haired werewolf,

1:01:18.250 --> 1:01:21.375
-I'll make sure to call you. Sit down.

1:01:21.458 --> 1:01:22.916
-Dot?
-Hmm?

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:24.500
Please tell me you can do better.

1:01:24.583 --> 1:01:25.583
Watch me.

1:01:40.875 --> 1:01:42.375
Is it poisoned?

1:01:42.458 --> 1:01:44.750
It… could be.

1:01:45.583 --> 1:01:47.666
Well, it's better than a stray hair.

1:01:49.041 --> 1:01:50.500
We can work with that.

1:01:51.125 --> 1:01:52.583
Sophie.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.875
Those who are truly Good
can summon the animals of the forest.

1:01:58.958 --> 1:02:00.791
-Mm.
-I used to do it with my squirrel friends.

1:02:00.875 --> 1:02:03.250
Oh God, give it up.

1:02:03.333 --> 1:02:05.375
Why don't you summon a cliff
and go jump off it?

1:02:06.541 --> 1:02:08.750
Why don't you find someone else
to have mommy issues with?

1:02:08.833 --> 1:02:11.166
Don't you dare talk about my mother.

1:02:12.041 --> 1:02:13.666
You know <i>nothing</i> about her!

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:17.166
I know she did one hell of a good job
turning you into a raving lunatic.

1:02:19.916 --> 1:02:22.250
I despise you, you freak.

1:02:23.541 --> 1:02:25.083
And everything you stand for.

1:02:25.166 --> 1:02:27.833
Which just proves
that I am at the wrong school.

1:02:27.916 --> 1:02:31.083
-You want to get out of here, princess?

1:02:31.166 --> 1:02:35.583
This raving lunatic's unique talent
would be more than happy

1:02:35.666 --> 1:02:37.708
to get rid of you permanently.

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:49.708
This is delightful.

1:03:16.416 --> 1:03:18.625
-Sophie, watch out!

1:03:35.625 --> 1:03:37.083
-Go!

1:03:39.666 --> 1:03:41.083
Oh!

1:03:41.166 --> 1:03:44.125
Be careful, Reader,
she's getting really close.

1:03:44.208 --> 1:03:45.625
Use your talents.

1:03:45.708 --> 1:03:47.875
I don't know what they are!

1:03:49.583 --> 1:03:53.291
Your squirrel friends, Sophie!
Call your squirrel friends!

1:03:53.375 --> 1:03:55.250
Help! Help me!

1:03:55.333 --> 1:03:56.666
Help!

1:03:56.750 --> 1:04:00.291
Aw, guess the squirrels
don't like you either.

1:04:01.416 --> 1:04:03.458
You poor little princess.

1:04:04.666 --> 1:04:06.291
Let me put you out of your misery.

1:04:06.375 --> 1:04:08.916
-She's gonna kill her!

1:04:34.208 --> 1:04:37.875
Sophie, you're not allowed to kill anyone
until after graduation.

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:39.250
Call them off!

1:04:39.916 --> 1:04:41.750
-Stop!

1:05:01.833 --> 1:05:02.833
Oh my God.

1:05:07.291 --> 1:05:08.333
Rafal?

1:05:09.500 --> 1:05:13.791
You're doing wonderfully…

1:05:15.250 --> 1:05:16.666
…Sophie.

1:05:57.416 --> 1:05:59.250
-Move out of the way!
-Move!

1:06:00.041 --> 1:06:00.875
Hester!

1:06:00.958 --> 1:06:03.583
-You're fine. It's okay.

1:06:03.666 --> 1:06:05.500
-It's okay.
-Gonna be okay. Breathe.

1:06:05.583 --> 1:06:07.750
We'll make sure
you're fine, okay? It's okay.

1:06:08.333 --> 1:06:10.041
-It's okay.

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:13.375
Who is that? Who is Rafal?

1:06:13.458 --> 1:06:14.958
Do not say his name again.

1:06:15.041 --> 1:06:16.416
Not to anyone but me.

1:06:16.500 --> 1:06:20.166
-Who is he, and how does he know me?
-Shh. He's the School Master's brother.

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:23.458
He was once the most powerful being
in our school.

1:06:24.875 --> 1:06:27.458
Evil hasn't beaten Good
ever since he disappeared.

1:06:27.541 --> 1:06:30.666
But somehow, your powers…
your powers have drawn his attention.

1:06:30.750 --> 1:06:33.291
I didn't know I had powers.
I don't want powers. I want to go--

1:06:33.375 --> 1:06:35.625
Oh, stop your whining!

1:06:35.708 --> 1:06:37.333
What you just did in that classroom

1:06:37.416 --> 1:06:40.041
is proof to me
that you are exactly where you belong!

1:06:40.916 --> 1:06:42.458
It's not what we are.

1:06:42.541 --> 1:06:44.958
It's what we do, Sophie.

1:06:46.333 --> 1:06:47.583
Now go.

1:06:47.666 --> 1:06:49.083
And tell no one.

1:06:49.166 --> 1:06:52.166
And if Rafal visits you again,
you must tell me immediately.

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:53.375
Go, go.

1:06:59.958 --> 1:07:01.625
If she is the one, Rafal…

1:07:04.250 --> 1:07:07.291
I'll do everything in my power
to deliver her to you.

1:07:09.625 --> 1:07:10.625
My love.

1:07:11.708 --> 1:07:14.083
-No, no, no.

1:07:14.166 --> 1:07:15.875
Of course we don't hate.

1:07:15.958 --> 1:07:17.333
Evil hates.

1:07:17.416 --> 1:07:18.791
Good loves.

1:07:18.875 --> 1:07:20.375
Evil attacks.

1:07:20.458 --> 1:07:23.208
Good defends.

1:07:23.291 --> 1:07:27.916
Chinen, when is Good permitted to attack?

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.750
It isn't. Good can only defend.

1:07:30.833 --> 1:07:34.416
If Good were to attack first,
by definition, it would be no longer Good.

1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:35.583
Precisely.

1:07:35.666 --> 1:07:37.500
What did you people do to him?

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:41.125
I'm sorry?

1:07:41.208 --> 1:07:43.125
Gregor failed three times,

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:46.125
and then he disappeared,
screaming in pain.

1:07:46.208 --> 1:07:47.625
What did you turn him into?

1:07:47.708 --> 1:07:51.125
The rules at this school must be obeyed.

1:07:51.208 --> 1:07:53.333
There are no exceptions.

1:07:56.333 --> 1:07:58.916
Ladies, as… as I was saying,

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.833
Evil has many weapons, but we…

1:08:02.916 --> 1:08:06.833
we have animals.

1:08:08.250 --> 1:08:12.166
Animals of the land, animals of the water.

1:08:12.916 --> 1:08:17.125
-And so, ladies, today I present to you…

1:08:18.166 --> 1:08:19.500
…wish fish,

1:08:19.583 --> 1:08:22.625
shimmering underwater friends,

1:08:22.708 --> 1:08:27.500
who understand us and our deepest desires.

1:08:27.583 --> 1:08:29.833
Is that because
they used to be students here?

1:08:30.458 --> 1:08:31.416
Enough.

1:08:32.083 --> 1:08:35.583
Not everyone earns their own story.

1:08:35.666 --> 1:08:40.875
At least they can still be
part of someone else's happy ending.

1:08:41.583 --> 1:08:43.875
Ladies, if your wish is strong enough,

1:08:43.958 --> 1:08:46.833
then they might make it come true.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:50.666
-Who's first?

1:08:51.291 --> 1:08:52.958
Me! Me, me!

1:08:54.125 --> 1:08:55.833
-Kiko.

1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:08.750
It's Tristan! He loves me.

1:09:10.291 --> 1:09:11.333
Let me try.

1:09:11.416 --> 1:09:13.083
-Tristan.
-Move, Kiko.

1:09:13.166 --> 1:09:14.208
-Move.
-Ah.

1:09:14.291 --> 1:09:16.041
-Get out of the way.

1:09:28.958 --> 1:09:29.791
Tedros.

1:09:31.041 --> 1:09:32.291
We look perfect together.

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.666
The Evers Ball,

1:09:37.250 --> 1:09:43.083
where many of you
may receive your first kiss next week!

1:09:44.208 --> 1:09:45.458
Agatha.

1:09:46.333 --> 1:09:47.333
Your turn.

1:09:49.375 --> 1:09:50.375
Any wish?

1:09:52.750 --> 1:09:57.041
Whatever your heart most desires.

1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:17.583
I wish for home.
For all of us.

1:10:31.375 --> 1:10:32.583
What are you doing?

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.125
What's happening?

1:10:36.208 --> 1:10:38.458
That's enough now, Agatha. Please stop.

1:10:38.958 --> 1:10:40.750
I… I can't let go!

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:45.958
-Get back! Get back! Get back!

1:11:02.250 --> 1:11:04.125
-Who is she?

1:11:12.958 --> 1:11:15.125
A hundred years since I failed.

1:11:15.625 --> 1:11:17.375
A hundred years of granting wishes.

1:11:18.416 --> 1:11:20.541
You were the first to wish to free me,

1:11:21.041 --> 1:11:22.500
to wish me home.

1:11:24.375 --> 1:11:25.375
Thank you.

1:11:47.083 --> 1:11:48.583
-Run. Run!

1:11:48.666 --> 1:11:51.333
Run! Go, go, go!

1:11:51.416 --> 1:11:52.500
Run! Run!

1:11:59.583 --> 1:12:02.875
Run! Run!
Agatha, get out of there!

1:12:02.958 --> 1:12:04.041
Get up!

1:12:05.791 --> 1:12:06.791
Get up!

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:14.083
Gregor?

1:12:16.041 --> 1:12:17.083
Hey, Gregor.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:19.041
-No, don't! Get back from it!
-Gregor!

1:12:20.708 --> 1:12:24.416
Hey, Gregor, I don't know
if I can help you or not.

1:12:27.208 --> 1:12:29.708
But if I can, I will.

1:12:34.291 --> 1:12:35.541
-I've got you!

1:12:35.625 --> 1:12:37.166
-Don't worry, Agatha!

1:12:52.708 --> 1:12:54.791
-You okay?

1:12:55.625 --> 1:12:56.916
What did you do?

1:12:57.875 --> 1:12:58.833
That was my friend!

1:12:58.916 --> 1:13:01.000
It was about to kill you!
I've just saved your life!

1:13:01.083 --> 1:13:02.791
You pompous ass, you killed him!

1:13:02.875 --> 1:13:05.458
-No!
-No! Tedros was rescuing you!

1:13:05.541 --> 1:13:07.125
Everyone, back to your dorms!

1:13:07.208 --> 1:13:09.250
Classes are canceled
for the rest of the day.

1:13:09.333 --> 1:13:10.750
You, come with me. Go!

1:13:11.416 --> 1:13:13.333
-Go, go, go!

1:13:13.416 --> 1:13:16.416
Gregor, I'm so sorry.

1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:18.125
-Agatha--
-Stop!

1:13:18.916 --> 1:13:20.708
That's what you call Good?

1:13:21.958 --> 1:13:23.500
Destroying someone kind

1:13:23.583 --> 1:13:26.791
because they can't live up
to your impossible expectations?

1:13:26.875 --> 1:13:28.541
What exactly is good about that?

1:13:28.625 --> 1:13:33.083
Agatha, everyone has a role to play here.
In time, you will understand.

1:13:33.166 --> 1:13:34.458
No, I won't.

1:13:35.041 --> 1:13:37.083
I told you, I don't belong here.

1:13:37.166 --> 1:13:38.791
What is wrong with you?

1:13:40.708 --> 1:13:44.166
Once upon a time, Good was real and true.

1:13:44.250 --> 1:13:47.458
Now we are in the age
of self-centered perfectionism,

1:13:47.541 --> 1:13:52.166
but you used your wish
to save that poor girl.

1:13:52.250 --> 1:13:55.333
Do you remember when I told you
that magic follows emotion?

1:13:56.666 --> 1:14:00.208
The most powerful emotion is empathy.

1:14:01.666 --> 1:14:05.041
The passion you've shown
tells me that you,

1:14:05.125 --> 1:14:09.375
young lady, are exactly where you belong.

1:14:11.250 --> 1:14:16.000
You are the first real princess
this school has seen

1:14:16.958 --> 1:14:20.791
in a long, long time.

1:14:37.958 --> 1:14:39.541
We have to talk.

1:14:39.625 --> 1:14:40.791
Did you give Tedros my letter?

1:14:40.875 --> 1:14:43.291
Yes, but something very bad
is going on here.

1:14:43.375 --> 1:14:44.333
Yeah, tell me about it.

1:14:44.416 --> 1:14:46.416
I just got visited by a swarm of bees

1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:48.416
that is apparently the most Evil man
in the world.

1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:49.916
Some guy named Rafal.

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.458
That's the guy I saw. No, no, Sophie.
We have to get out now, kiss or no kiss.

1:14:53.541 --> 1:14:54.916
No, wait. What did Tedros say?

1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.500
He said your friend had
one hell of a right hook.

1:14:57.583 --> 1:15:00.041
Oh no. What happened to your eye?

1:15:00.666 --> 1:15:02.000
Uh, ask your friend.

1:15:02.083 --> 1:15:03.166
You hit him?

1:15:04.125 --> 1:15:05.416
Aggie, why?

1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:08.125
I just had the nerve
to save her life, you know.

1:15:08.208 --> 1:15:11.291
Just meet me outside when you're finished
doing whatever you have to do.

1:15:14.416 --> 1:15:15.833
-So sorry.

1:15:17.500 --> 1:15:21.625
She can be temperamental…
and violent, apparently. 

1:15:22.666 --> 1:15:23.708
Sophie, right?

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:25.833
Yeah.

1:15:25.916 --> 1:15:27.583
You write nice letters.

1:15:27.666 --> 1:15:29.625
I just didn't know how else to meet you.

1:15:30.833 --> 1:15:32.541
They keep us so separate here.

1:15:32.625 --> 1:15:36.208
Yeah, probably best
to keep Good and Evil apart. Less messy.

1:15:36.291 --> 1:15:39.666
That is, unless you're unlucky enough
to be trapped in the wrong school.

1:15:39.750 --> 1:15:43.000
-She's not in the wrong school.

1:15:43.083 --> 1:15:46.458
But she's definitely not supposed
to be talking to princes.

1:15:46.541 --> 1:15:48.500
-No!
-No, you don't need to drag her--

1:15:48.583 --> 1:15:50.916
Tedros, please!
I didn't do anything!

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.333
-Hey. Hey.

1:15:53.416 --> 1:15:55.875
She's Evil, Teddy.
Let them take care of her.

1:15:56.875 --> 1:15:58.625
Where are you taking me?

1:15:58.708 --> 1:16:00.333
-The Doom Room.
-The what?

1:16:03.333 --> 1:16:07.250
No! I didn't do anything that bad!

1:16:10.083 --> 1:16:13.291
Which is precisely why you're down here.

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.625
You.

1:16:15.708 --> 1:16:18.000
You, you, you.

1:16:19.875 --> 1:16:22.916
Whom Rafal has chosen above all others.

1:16:24.666 --> 1:16:27.541
You could be the savior
our school's been waiting for.

1:16:27.625 --> 1:16:28.750
But no.

1:16:28.833 --> 1:16:32.208
You waste your time being distracted

1:16:32.291 --> 1:16:35.291
by foolish Everboy <i>princes.</i>

1:16:35.375 --> 1:16:37.041
Please don't hurt me.

1:16:37.125 --> 1:16:40.333
-You've been given a great gift, Sophie.

1:16:42.458 --> 1:16:45.333
One I will not let you sabotage.

1:16:51.625 --> 1:16:53.083
The time has come…

1:16:55.125 --> 1:16:59.125
for you to admit which side you're on.

1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:07.083
Rafal only wants one who's truly Evil.

1:17:08.750 --> 1:17:14.791
It's clear your beauty
is keeping you and others

1:17:14.875 --> 1:17:18.833
-from accepting who you really are.

1:17:30.208 --> 1:17:32.541
No! No!

1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:36.875
Hey, meathead. Stop!

1:17:36.958 --> 1:17:38.666
Oh God, what did I do now?

1:17:38.750 --> 1:17:41.083
Apparently, you stood there
while one of the giant dogs

1:17:41.166 --> 1:17:42.875
dragged Sophie away screaming.

1:17:42.958 --> 1:17:45.666
Hey, I rescue princesses and defeat Evil.
I don't save it. Okay?

1:17:45.750 --> 1:17:46.875
You know who's Evil?

1:17:46.958 --> 1:17:49.125
Yes. Because it's literally
on the name of her school.

1:17:49.208 --> 1:17:51.125
Because I'm Good.
That's what I'm supposed to do.

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:52.416
That's what I have to do, okay?

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:55.625
-Start getting the concept of this place.
-No, I get it fine.

1:17:55.708 --> 1:17:57.000
And it's ridiculous.

1:17:57.083 --> 1:17:59.125
You know that Evil stymph you killed?

1:18:00.208 --> 1:18:02.291
Yeah, that was Gregor.

1:18:03.916 --> 1:18:07.208
-No, it wasn't. I would have known that.
-Mm, but you didn't.

1:18:09.666 --> 1:18:10.666
Are you sure?

1:18:10.750 --> 1:18:15.416
Ask Dovey. And then come back and tell me
how you know Evil when you see it.

1:18:18.541 --> 1:18:20.791
You know what?
Try thinking for yourself for a change,

1:18:20.875 --> 1:18:23.833
and you might see past the black and white
this school wants you to see.

1:18:24.791 --> 1:18:27.291
You might be surprised
by what you figure out.

1:18:39.416 --> 1:18:40.791
Why is this happening to me?

1:18:43.625 --> 1:18:45.333
Because it is your destiny.

1:18:54.125 --> 1:18:55.416
Rafal?

1:18:55.500 --> 1:19:00.041
You can be more than you ever dreamed
you could be, Sophie. After all…

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:03.708
Always remember how special you are.

1:19:05.166 --> 1:19:08.333
You're gonna change the world someday.

1:19:08.416 --> 1:19:11.458
And you <i>are </i>special, Sophie.

1:19:11.541 --> 1:19:13.708
But they all refuse to see it.

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:17.958
You've been honest, kind, patient,

1:19:18.583 --> 1:19:20.250
and did they admit you were Good?

1:19:22.375 --> 1:19:23.458
No.

1:19:24.291 --> 1:19:26.500
I'm the only one you can trust.

1:19:26.583 --> 1:19:28.208
Forget about their rules.

1:19:28.708 --> 1:19:32.291
Do what you want, when you want.

1:19:32.875 --> 1:19:35.791
And if they won't give you what's yours,

1:19:36.791 --> 1:19:38.083
take it.

1:19:39.166 --> 1:19:41.625
<i>Drawn in by Rafal's words,</i>

1:19:41.708 --> 1:19:46.875
<i>Sophie decided she would do</i>
<i>whatever it took to win Tedros</i>

1:19:46.958 --> 1:19:50.833
<i>-and gain true love's kiss.</i>

1:19:54.750 --> 1:19:55.750
Lose something?

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.916
Or just looking for another face to punch?

1:20:00.166 --> 1:20:01.916
-Can't find Sophie.

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:03.625
Just want to make sure she's okay.

1:20:04.916 --> 1:20:06.875
Well, I'm sure she won't miss this.

1:20:07.458 --> 1:20:08.458
Big day today.

1:20:08.958 --> 1:20:11.541
Both schools finally getting access
to their magic.

1:20:12.250 --> 1:20:16.291
Hey, you should know
some people are saying you're a witch.

1:20:16.791 --> 1:20:18.875
Yeah, I've heard that before.

1:20:18.958 --> 1:20:19.791
Well…

1:20:21.541 --> 1:20:24.333
For the record, I don't think you are.

1:20:26.583 --> 1:20:27.458
Yeah?

1:20:28.125 --> 1:20:29.791
Then what am I, hmm?

1:20:32.250 --> 1:20:33.250
I wish I knew.

1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:38.875
Because you're sure not like
anybody I've ever met before.

1:20:48.958 --> 1:20:53.458
I… I… can't do this.

1:20:54.458 --> 1:20:56.750
Do what? Uh, fall down?

1:20:58.125 --> 1:20:59.625
Shut up!

1:21:00.250 --> 1:21:02.000
Everyone, find your seats.

1:21:02.083 --> 1:21:03.500
-Let's begin.
-Mm.

1:21:04.750 --> 1:21:08.208
To access one's magic,

1:21:08.291 --> 1:21:12.041
one must first unlock one's finger glow.

1:21:12.125 --> 1:21:14.875
Once you've mastered your finger glow,

1:21:14.958 --> 1:21:17.250
it will prove to be invaluable.

1:21:19.041 --> 1:21:20.333
I can't wait.

1:21:20.416 --> 1:21:23.833
They say some people can transform
into animals when they have their magic.

1:21:23.916 --> 1:21:27.333
I want to turn into a cat at night
so I can sleep under a stove.

1:21:27.416 --> 1:21:28.791
Oh, it'd be so warm.

1:21:30.083 --> 1:21:31.083
Shall we?

1:21:36.916 --> 1:21:39.708
Have no fear, Evers.

1:21:39.791 --> 1:21:43.041
Good feels no pain.

1:21:45.375 --> 1:21:49.166
-Nevers…

1:21:49.250 --> 1:21:50.958
…it's going to hurt.

1:21:51.041 --> 1:21:53.000
-Oh good.
-Ugh.

1:21:53.083 --> 1:21:54.208
Line up!

1:21:54.291 --> 1:21:56.000
-Me first!

1:21:57.875 --> 1:22:00.166
Hey! Let me through!

1:22:00.250 --> 1:22:01.875
No way! Me first!

1:22:07.625 --> 1:22:09.208
-Beautiful.

1:22:10.041 --> 1:22:11.125
Stop.

1:22:20.083 --> 1:22:25.375
Your finger glow helps you become aware
of the power inside you.

1:22:25.458 --> 1:22:26.666
Ooh!

1:22:26.750 --> 1:22:29.291
Ow, ow, ow!

1:22:29.375 --> 1:22:30.500
Thank you, ma'am.

1:22:33.500 --> 1:22:36.791
When your finger glows, it means
you've begun to tap into emotions

1:22:36.875 --> 1:22:38.666
-powerful enough…

1:22:38.750 --> 1:22:40.708
-…to cast a spell.

1:22:43.916 --> 1:22:45.833
The stronger your feelings…

1:22:47.833 --> 1:22:49.708
…the stronger your magic.

1:23:00.333 --> 1:23:01.500
I hope I'm not late.

1:23:21.416 --> 1:23:22.541
What is this all about?

1:23:22.625 --> 1:23:25.541
This? Turns out you did me a favor.

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:27.375
I was long overdue for a makeover.

1:23:29.875 --> 1:23:33.208
Now, if you wouldn't mind
activating my powers,

1:23:33.291 --> 1:23:34.541
I'd be most grateful.

1:23:41.708 --> 1:23:42.541
Hm.

1:23:46.083 --> 1:23:47.083
Thank you.

1:24:18.291 --> 1:24:19.166
Truce?

1:24:19.916 --> 1:24:21.833
Now, who wants a facial?

1:24:23.916 --> 1:24:24.916
Draw!

1:24:27.875 --> 1:24:28.958
Heh.

1:24:54.750 --> 1:24:59.500
And whether Good or Evil,
beauty is a full-time job.

1:25:01.541 --> 1:25:02.791
We need to talk.

1:25:03.458 --> 1:25:06.291
-About?

1:25:06.375 --> 1:25:07.458
Oh!

1:25:08.083 --> 1:25:09.291
I have it under control.

1:25:09.375 --> 1:25:10.750
I don't think you do.

1:25:10.833 --> 1:25:12.666
So I'm supposed to take romantic advice

1:25:12.750 --> 1:25:14.750
from a girl who used to make
phlegm sculptures?

1:25:26.791 --> 1:25:28.958
Why are you acting like this?

1:25:29.041 --> 1:25:31.791
Because I'm tired of being
pathetic little Sophie.

1:25:31.875 --> 1:25:34.500
The girl who defended me
with a frying pan wasn't pathetic.

1:25:34.583 --> 1:25:36.083
Well, I like the new me.

1:25:38.541 --> 1:25:40.375
Okay, what's with the book?

1:25:42.666 --> 1:25:46.166
Tedros's father chose his bride,
Guinevere, for her beauty,

1:25:46.250 --> 1:25:48.375
but then she betrayed him with Lancelot.

1:25:48.458 --> 1:25:51.833
King Arthur lost his throne
and died of a broken heart.

1:25:51.916 --> 1:25:54.000
And this is supposed to be, what?

1:25:54.083 --> 1:25:56.166
-Date conversation?
-Don't you get it?

1:25:56.250 --> 1:25:57.958
After what happened to his father,

1:25:58.041 --> 1:26:01.291
Tedros isn't going to fall for someone
just because she's hot.

1:26:04.208 --> 1:26:06.666
You need to prove to him that you're Good,

1:26:07.333 --> 1:26:10.791
in front of everybody,
in a way no one can deny.

1:26:12.375 --> 1:26:14.458
Fine.

1:26:16.750 --> 1:26:17.833
What do I have to do?

1:26:20.791 --> 1:26:21.916
Good shot.

1:26:28.916 --> 1:26:31.750
-Hi.

1:26:31.833 --> 1:26:34.625
Sorry. Didn't mean to distract you.

1:26:34.708 --> 1:26:37.375
Heh. Nothing distracts me.

1:26:40.750 --> 1:26:42.625
Then maybe I'm just good luck.

1:26:42.708 --> 1:26:44.208
Don't flatter yourself.

1:26:44.291 --> 1:26:45.583
It's prince's code.

1:26:45.666 --> 1:26:48.000
Your arrow flies straight
if you're pure of heart.

1:26:53.458 --> 1:26:56.375
What do you think
you're doing?

1:26:56.458 --> 1:26:58.958
Where I come from,
girls are allowed to do anything boys do.

1:26:59.041 --> 1:27:00.916
It's got nothing to do
with you being a girl.

1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:02.625
-Hmm?
-Nevers can't shoot.

1:27:02.708 --> 1:27:04.750
The whole lack of pure heart and all.

1:27:04.833 --> 1:27:08.125
I told you, I am not a Never.

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:10.708
Oh, please, not a Never.

1:27:12.125 --> 1:27:13.625
Keep your elbow tight.

1:27:15.458 --> 1:27:17.375
Extend this and relax the grip.

1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:26.458
It helps if you focus on the target.

1:27:39.166 --> 1:27:40.375
Take it away.

1:27:51.833 --> 1:27:52.666
Hmm.

1:27:53.666 --> 1:27:55.083
Never doubted you for a minute.

1:27:58.541 --> 1:27:59.541
Do you wanna hang out?

1:28:00.791 --> 1:28:02.291
I don't know. With who?

1:28:03.083 --> 1:28:05.916
Just some prince
who wants to get to know you better.

1:28:10.916 --> 1:28:11.916
You're up.

1:28:19.916 --> 1:28:21.875
Traitors.

1:28:21.958 --> 1:28:23.375
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1:28:23.458 --> 1:28:26.041
Ugh. I don't know what she sees in him.

1:28:26.125 --> 1:28:28.041
It's an affront to us all.

1:28:28.125 --> 1:28:29.125
It's not right.

1:28:29.791 --> 1:28:31.041
I hate to say it.

1:28:31.125 --> 1:28:32.541
This is bad.

1:28:32.625 --> 1:28:33.750
She's mine.

1:28:34.916 --> 1:28:36.333
Or ours.

1:28:36.416 --> 1:28:37.500
She's a Never!

1:28:37.583 --> 1:28:40.750
-It's bloody disgusting.
-We should eat them.

1:28:43.208 --> 1:28:44.875
They've been together all day.

1:28:45.583 --> 1:28:47.250
So tragic.

1:28:55.041 --> 1:28:58.125
You do know that no one's
ever wanting to see us together.

1:28:59.291 --> 1:29:00.291
I do.

1:29:00.375 --> 1:29:02.291
And me being with someone
who they think's a Never

1:29:02.375 --> 1:29:04.791
is gonna send the entire school
into chaos.

1:29:04.875 --> 1:29:06.083
I'd survive.

1:29:06.166 --> 1:29:09.666
And they're all gonna lose their minds
when I take you to the Evers Ball.

1:29:09.750 --> 1:29:11.833
What?

1:29:11.916 --> 1:29:13.541
-Teddy, you promise?
-Of course.

1:29:20.208 --> 1:29:21.041
What?

1:29:22.250 --> 1:29:23.250
No.

1:29:25.166 --> 1:29:31.041
You are not taking
that underdressed she-wolf instead of me.

1:29:32.875 --> 1:29:34.166
One of you, do something.

1:29:35.708 --> 1:29:36.583
Hmm.

1:29:36.666 --> 1:29:37.791
-Shh.

1:29:42.125 --> 1:29:43.958
-Going somewhere?

1:29:45.083 --> 1:29:47.041
-Down your throat!

1:29:47.125 --> 1:29:49.166
-Come on!

1:29:56.125 --> 1:29:57.500
Stop!

1:30:00.125 --> 1:30:02.625
-Stop it!

1:30:04.083 --> 1:30:07.041
Why? Why are we still entertaining
this preposterous--

1:30:07.125 --> 1:30:08.541
Please! Please! Please!

1:30:08.625 --> 1:30:13.666
Dating between Evers and Nevers
is strictly against the rules.

1:30:13.750 --> 1:30:15.041
-Thank you.
-Yes!

1:30:15.125 --> 1:30:18.333
Evil and Good do not belong together.

1:30:18.416 --> 1:30:20.750
It's rep… repulsive.

1:30:20.833 --> 1:30:22.000
Sir, if I may.

1:30:22.083 --> 1:30:24.583
I'm responsible for choosing Camelot's
next queen.

1:30:24.666 --> 1:30:26.125
I do not take that decision lightly.

1:30:26.208 --> 1:30:28.833
I chose Sophie because she <i>is </i>Good.
She's just in the wrong school.

1:30:28.916 --> 1:30:30.833
If he believes it, why can't you?

1:30:30.916 --> 1:30:33.666
Besides, nothing can keep true love apart.

1:30:34.666 --> 1:30:36.583
Isn't that, like,
the first rule of fairy tales?

1:30:36.666 --> 1:30:39.583
If it is <i>true</i> love,

1:30:40.500 --> 1:30:43.708
such a thing would certainly be momentous.

1:30:45.125 --> 1:30:47.541
It seems to me
there's only one way to be sure.

1:30:48.333 --> 1:30:49.750
A Trial by Tale!

1:30:49.833 --> 1:30:51.958
-What? No!
-But sir!

1:30:52.041 --> 1:30:53.041
Sir, I accept.

1:30:54.291 --> 1:30:55.916
Uh…

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:58.000
Sorry. What is a Trial by Tale?

1:31:00.208 --> 1:31:04.083
Each of you have to enter the Blue Forest
on opposite sides.

1:31:04.166 --> 1:31:07.083
You have to defeat
whatever danger presents itself

1:31:07.166 --> 1:31:08.375
and find each other by dawn.

1:31:08.458 --> 1:31:10.916
Help, strictly forbidden.

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:12.958
Sophie, we can do this.

1:31:13.458 --> 1:31:15.916
We're good enough
and strong enough to protect each other.

1:31:17.541 --> 1:31:18.791
-We can do this.
-What?

1:31:18.875 --> 1:31:21.583
This will get them <i>both</i> killed!

1:31:22.166 --> 1:31:24.000
The trial shall begin…

1:31:25.916 --> 1:31:27.083
…at sundown.

1:31:37.833 --> 1:31:40.125
<i>Tedros of Camelot.</i>

1:31:40.708 --> 1:31:42.208
<i>Sophie of Gavaldon.</i>

1:31:42.833 --> 1:31:46.625
A Trial by Tale
is not to be taken lightly.

1:31:56.041 --> 1:32:00.500
<i>Mortal danger lurks</i>
<i>beyond the school's gates.</i>

1:32:00.583 --> 1:32:02.583
Do you still wish to proceed?

1:32:03.625 --> 1:32:04.625
I do.

1:32:05.500 --> 1:32:06.500
Yes.

1:32:07.166 --> 1:32:08.166
Definitely.

1:32:13.958 --> 1:32:15.791
<i>If you wish to give up,</i>

1:32:16.750 --> 1:32:21.833
<i>drop the red handkerchief on the ground,</i>
<i>and you will be transported to safety.</i>

1:32:24.083 --> 1:32:26.458
-Let the trial begin.

1:32:59.500 --> 1:33:00.916
Tedros?

1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:03.583
-Hello?

1:33:03.666 --> 1:33:05.250
I'm over here!

1:33:07.125 --> 1:33:09.041
I'm ready to be saved!

1:33:12.041 --> 1:33:13.250
Aww.

1:33:13.333 --> 1:33:15.458
Flowers. Pretty.

1:33:15.541 --> 1:33:16.833
Let's stick to pretty.

1:33:28.750 --> 1:33:31.041
-Hello, my little friends.

1:33:31.750 --> 1:33:34.083
We're all so beautiful.

1:33:35.041 --> 1:33:36.041
It's me.

1:33:47.375 --> 1:33:48.833
Help!

1:33:54.791 --> 1:33:56.916
No!

1:34:03.708 --> 1:34:04.916
Tedros, help!

1:34:06.166 --> 1:34:07.541
Tedros!

1:34:08.875 --> 1:34:09.916
Tedros?

1:34:12.916 --> 1:34:14.750
Tedros, where are you?

1:34:24.916 --> 1:34:25.833
Okay.

1:34:27.416 --> 1:34:28.583
Pumpkins are fun.

1:34:45.750 --> 1:34:47.416
Tedros, help!

1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:50.000
Tedros!

1:35:02.083 --> 1:35:04.708
-Sophie, come on! Go, go, go!

1:35:04.791 --> 1:35:06.541
-Go!

1:35:07.708 --> 1:35:09.041
Sophie!

1:35:10.625 --> 1:35:12.208
-Sophie!
-It's okay. Okay.

1:35:12.291 --> 1:35:15.708
Go to him. Once he saves you, kiss him,
and then we can get out of this madhouse.

1:35:15.791 --> 1:35:17.375
-Okay? Go.

1:35:19.458 --> 1:35:20.875
-Sophie!
-Tedros!

1:35:22.916 --> 1:35:24.875
Oh, Tedros, thank God.

1:35:27.666 --> 1:35:29.125
-No!

1:35:59.625 --> 1:36:01.541
Sophie, grab Excalibur.

1:36:02.291 --> 1:36:03.250
Help him.

1:36:16.791 --> 1:36:19.833
-Sophie! Toss my sword, now!

1:36:24.166 --> 1:36:25.916
-Sophie, do something!

1:36:50.750 --> 1:36:51.833
What are you doing here?

1:36:54.583 --> 1:36:56.083
You! You cheated!

1:36:56.166 --> 1:36:57.666
-You brought Agatha!
-No!

1:36:58.458 --> 1:36:59.791
No, I came on my own. I swear.

1:36:59.875 --> 1:37:01.875
-Yeah.
-You knew she wouldn't help me.

1:37:01.958 --> 1:37:03.666
-That's not true.
-That's not fair.

1:37:04.541 --> 1:37:07.291
Everyone knows the prince saves
the princess, not the other way around.

1:37:07.791 --> 1:37:11.458
-I can't change the world if I'm dead.

1:37:11.541 --> 1:37:12.833
And I thought you were Good.

1:37:12.916 --> 1:37:13.791
No.

1:37:13.875 --> 1:37:15.750
No, no, no. No, no. <i>No!</i>

1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:20.000
You.

1:37:21.208 --> 1:37:22.416
<i>You</i> did this.

1:37:22.500 --> 1:37:24.916
I… I was just trying to help.

1:37:25.583 --> 1:37:27.833
Sophie, you know
you'd both be dead right now if I hadn't.

1:37:27.916 --> 1:37:30.000
Liar. You knew this would happen.

1:37:30.791 --> 1:37:34.125
First, you steal my school,
and now you're trying to steal my prince.

1:37:34.208 --> 1:37:38.916
How can you say that? I…
Sophie, I'm your best friend.

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.250
A princess can't be friends with a witch.

1:38:02.666 --> 1:38:04.166
Oh!

1:38:04.250 --> 1:38:05.416
Where have you been?

1:38:05.500 --> 1:38:07.708
Trying to talk to Sophie,
but they locked her in her room.

1:38:07.791 --> 1:38:10.458
Yes, they locked her in
because she broke the rules.

1:38:10.541 --> 1:38:11.833
You both did.

1:38:11.916 --> 1:38:15.083
Why? Why did you help her in the trial?

1:38:15.166 --> 1:38:17.250
Did you not think
she could do it on her own?

1:38:17.333 --> 1:38:21.916
I thought that you believed
that Sophie was truly Good.

1:38:22.541 --> 1:38:23.583
I don't.

1:38:23.666 --> 1:38:27.166
I don't believe that anyone
is truly Good or truly Evil,

1:38:27.250 --> 1:38:29.250
because people are complicated,

1:38:29.333 --> 1:38:31.541
even if everybody in this place
pretends they aren't.

1:38:31.625 --> 1:38:32.541
Young lady.

1:38:32.625 --> 1:38:35.833
-The rules of this school must be--
-Must be obeyed.

1:38:35.916 --> 1:38:39.791
You keep saying that,
but what good are your rules

1:38:39.875 --> 1:38:43.250
if you don't do anything about it
when actual, dangerous Evil is here?

1:38:43.333 --> 1:38:44.458
Please!

1:38:44.541 --> 1:38:48.375
Sophie is many, many things,
but I would hardly call her dangerous.

1:38:48.458 --> 1:38:50.000
Not Sophie. Rafal!

1:38:53.375 --> 1:38:54.958
What did you just say?

1:38:55.041 --> 1:38:57.416
Rafal. I saw him again in the forest,

1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:59.500
but clearly, none of you
have done anything about it.

1:38:59.583 --> 1:39:03.000
"Again"?
What does that mean?

1:39:03.083 --> 1:39:05.750
Have you seen Rafal before? Here?

1:39:05.833 --> 1:39:06.958
Yeah.

1:39:07.041 --> 1:39:09.750
In the tower of blood
I told the School Master about.

1:39:09.833 --> 1:39:11.750
And Sophie saw him in her classroom.

1:39:11.833 --> 1:39:14.833
So did Lady Lesso. Didn't she tell you?

1:39:14.916 --> 1:39:16.875
Lesso.

1:39:17.666 --> 1:39:19.958
I should have known.

1:39:20.041 --> 1:39:22.916
Come with me.
We will get to the bottom of this.

1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.750
Come on. Go!

1:39:30.375 --> 1:39:31.500
Sophie?

1:39:31.583 --> 1:39:33.041
Um…

1:39:33.125 --> 1:39:37.166
…Agatha asked me to give you this.

1:39:37.250 --> 1:39:38.291
I…

1:39:39.583 --> 1:39:42.208
I hope you feel better soon.

1:39:45.083 --> 1:39:48.708
<i>Dear Sophie, I'm so sorry</i>
<i>for what happened in the forest.</i>

1:39:48.791 --> 1:39:50.583
<i>I never meant to hurt you.</i>

1:39:50.666 --> 1:39:51.791
<i>But whatever's going on,</i>

1:39:51.875 --> 1:39:54.291
<i>it's more than you getting a kiss</i>
<i>from a prince.</i>

1:39:54.375 --> 1:39:56.583
<i>I saw Rafal in the woods.</i>

1:39:56.666 --> 1:40:00.083
<i>I think what's happening here</i>
<i>is bigger than anyone realizes.</i>

1:40:00.166 --> 1:40:03.041
<i>It's true Evil,</i>
<i>and we have to stick together.</i>

1:40:03.125 --> 1:40:05.500
-<i>Only trust each other.</i>

1:40:05.583 --> 1:40:07.000
<i>We're best friends.</i>

1:40:07.083 --> 1:40:10.083
<i>You must know,</i>
<i>no matter what, I'm on your side.</i>

1:40:10.791 --> 1:40:13.208
<i>-All my love, Aggie.</i>

1:40:14.625 --> 1:40:17.000
Don't tell me
you actually believe that.

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.000
It's a lie.

1:40:20.666 --> 1:40:23.625
And besides, that prince
wasn't good enough for you anyway.

1:40:24.166 --> 1:40:25.166
You're back?

1:40:25.875 --> 1:40:29.000
-But I thought--
-I'd left you? Never.

1:40:29.583 --> 1:40:32.458
Even if everyone else has betrayed you.

1:40:33.833 --> 1:40:36.375
-Aggie hasn't.
-No?

1:40:36.458 --> 1:40:38.416
-See for yourself.

1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:42.750
I thought you believed
that Sophie was truly Good.

1:40:43.250 --> 1:40:44.958
I don't.

1:40:46.833 --> 1:40:50.416
-She's been lying to you, Sophie.

1:40:50.500 --> 1:40:52.916
Working against you
from the very beginning.

1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:57.208
She means to drag you
back to that miserable little village.

1:40:59.291 --> 1:41:00.750
But I'll protect you.

1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:03.125
I'll help you.

1:41:08.625 --> 1:41:09.875
Don't be scared.

1:41:10.750 --> 1:41:16.083
Think of yourself as a caterpillar
about to transform into a butterfly.

1:41:16.166 --> 1:41:17.458
Very soon,

1:41:17.541 --> 1:41:21.958
you'll emerge more beautiful
and more powerful than ever.

1:41:22.833 --> 1:41:26.625
A queen unlike this school has ever seen.

1:41:27.750 --> 1:41:32.791
I can give you abilities
they only dream of.

1:41:32.875 --> 1:41:35.083
You'll not just be
the fairest of them all,

1:41:36.125 --> 1:41:38.333
you'll be the strongest.

1:41:40.541 --> 1:41:43.041
Blood magic, Sophie.

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.041
My love…

1:41:48.500 --> 1:41:50.916
…will you accept

1:41:52.166 --> 1:41:53.541
this gift?

1:41:53.625 --> 1:41:55.708
-I will.

1:41:59.291 --> 1:42:04.125
You knew Rafal was here,
in the school, and you told no one?

1:42:04.208 --> 1:42:07.041
Ah, must have slipped my mind.

1:42:07.125 --> 1:42:12.458
I see! The soul of wickedness itself
just slipped your mind, Lesso?

1:42:12.541 --> 1:42:15.791
I'm the Dean of the School for <i>Evil.</i>

1:42:15.875 --> 1:42:17.750
Does that suggest anything to you?

1:42:17.833 --> 1:42:19.833
Yeah, it suggests
that nobody in charge here knows

1:42:19.916 --> 1:42:21.375
what's going on in this stupid place.

1:42:21.458 --> 1:42:24.083
-Quiet, Reader!
-Or what? You'll fail me for frowning?

1:42:24.166 --> 1:42:26.125
Now, what does Rafal want with Sophie?

1:42:26.208 --> 1:42:28.625
For Evil to finally win!

1:42:29.375 --> 1:42:30.208
That's what.

1:42:30.291 --> 1:42:31.958
That's what you think will happen?

1:42:32.041 --> 1:42:34.000
Rafal won't help Evil win.

1:42:34.083 --> 1:42:37.291
When he tried to kill the School Master,
his own brother,

1:42:37.375 --> 1:42:40.375
his goal was to destroy the school,
both schools,

1:42:40.458 --> 1:42:43.041
so that he can keep
all the magic in the world to himself.

1:42:43.125 --> 1:42:46.333
Thank you so much, beauty teacher.

1:42:46.416 --> 1:42:50.666
Hey, I was the head
of the Magical History Department

1:42:50.750 --> 1:42:52.458
long before you got here, Red.

1:42:52.541 --> 1:42:54.125
-You were?
-Yes!

1:42:54.208 --> 1:42:56.416
Before this place
became insufferably shallow

1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:58.750
and I was demoted to beautification.

1:42:58.833 --> 1:43:01.333
Do I look like I give a shit
about smiling?

1:43:01.416 --> 1:43:03.250
Okay, then we have to protect Sophie.

1:43:03.333 --> 1:43:05.458
-And we will, as soon as we find her.

1:43:05.541 --> 1:43:06.958
Sophie is missing.

1:43:07.958 --> 1:43:09.375
-And Anemone is right.
-Oh.

1:43:09.458 --> 1:43:13.083
Rafal will destroy this entire school
if he joins forces with Sophie.

1:43:13.166 --> 1:43:14.000
Lies.

1:43:14.083 --> 1:43:16.125
All lies!

1:43:16.208 --> 1:43:18.750
This is just another ploy
to have Good win again.

1:43:18.833 --> 1:43:20.000
Trust me, it's not.

1:43:20.708 --> 1:43:23.166
If my brother is back from the dead,

1:43:23.250 --> 1:43:27.708
there is a good chance
none of us will survive, Lady Lesso.

1:43:27.791 --> 1:43:29.083
None of us.

1:43:29.166 --> 1:43:31.416
Go find Sophie now. Search both schools.

1:43:31.500 --> 1:43:32.916
Yes, of course.

1:43:34.583 --> 1:43:35.875
And Agatha.

1:43:37.583 --> 1:43:38.625
Go to the Evers Ball.

1:43:38.708 --> 1:43:42.875
Sophie may very well show there.
If she does, bring her to me.

1:43:43.916 --> 1:43:44.958
Now, go.

1:43:58.000 --> 1:43:59.791
"Living doll."

1:44:10.958 --> 1:44:12.500
-Sophie?

1:44:13.750 --> 1:44:14.875
Sophie.

1:44:14.958 --> 1:44:17.125
You're not… Oh my God.

1:44:17.208 --> 1:44:19.250
What has Rafal done to you?

1:44:19.333 --> 1:44:22.458
Taught me to accept
who I truly am, that's what.

1:44:22.541 --> 1:44:24.000
Isn't that what you wanted?

1:44:24.500 --> 1:44:27.375
I am a thing of beauty, am I not?

1:44:28.250 --> 1:44:31.000
The poison apple to Rafal's eye.

1:44:32.041 --> 1:44:34.708
The one whose talents
soar above all others.

1:44:36.083 --> 1:44:37.958
Please don't tell me
you're jealous.

1:44:39.083 --> 1:44:41.416
Leonora of Gavaldon.

1:44:42.041 --> 1:44:43.583
Rafal told me.

1:44:43.666 --> 1:44:48.833
Leonora, the lonely Reader
who wanted to be so much more.

1:44:48.916 --> 1:44:50.875
He saw something in you.

1:44:50.958 --> 1:44:53.250
An Evil you didn't know you had.

1:44:53.333 --> 1:44:56.000
<i>-And so he brought you here to nurture it.</i>

1:44:56.083 --> 1:45:00.458
<i>You tried so hard,</i>
<i>but you weren't Evil enough for him.</i>

1:45:01.083 --> 1:45:03.875
So he turned his back on you,
despite your love for him.

1:45:04.500 --> 1:45:07.750
And you've been trying
to prove yourself to him ever since…

1:45:08.833 --> 1:45:10.916
…hoping to win him over.

1:45:12.625 --> 1:45:16.208
But then along comes Sophie.

1:45:17.916 --> 1:45:19.333
What has he promised you?

1:45:20.041 --> 1:45:23.000
And what have you promised him?

1:45:23.750 --> 1:45:24.750
Oh.

1:45:25.666 --> 1:45:27.541
You're both such dolls to ask.

1:45:32.333 --> 1:45:34.125
-Sophie…

1:45:35.458 --> 1:45:37.916
-My God.

1:46:14.083 --> 1:46:16.166
I was worried you wouldn't come
without an invite.

1:46:16.250 --> 1:46:18.958
But then I thought, "You know Agatha.
She does what she wants."

1:46:19.041 --> 1:46:21.125
Tedros, have you seen Sophie?

1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:24.750
Look, for once,
can we talk about something else?

1:46:24.833 --> 1:46:26.333
Like what happened in the forest?

1:46:26.416 --> 1:46:28.791
-That was--
-Yes, later. Once I've found her.

1:46:28.875 --> 1:46:30.125
She yells at you,

1:46:30.208 --> 1:46:33.083
she disrespects you, she blames you
for everything wrong in her life,

1:46:33.166 --> 1:46:34.958
yet all you do is help her.

1:46:35.041 --> 1:46:37.625
Come on, why do you even think
she deserves saving?

1:46:38.875 --> 1:46:42.291
Look, back in Gavaldon, all my life,
they've called me a witch.

1:46:42.791 --> 1:46:44.291
They told me to my face how ugly I am

1:46:44.375 --> 1:46:47.666
and how someday they'll get around
to burning me and my mom.

1:46:47.750 --> 1:46:49.833
And the whole village just laughs,

1:46:50.833 --> 1:46:52.291
except for Sophie.

1:46:53.750 --> 1:46:57.041
She's the only one who has stood up for me
from the time we were kids.

1:46:57.125 --> 1:46:58.666
She's like my sister,

1:46:58.750 --> 1:47:00.916
and I'm not someone
who gives up on family.

1:47:02.250 --> 1:47:03.250
Not ever.

1:47:03.333 --> 1:47:04.791
No, you're… you're right.

1:47:06.708 --> 1:47:08.458
No one should ever give up on family.

1:47:08.541 --> 1:47:10.791
Agatha, you saved me from that reaper,

1:47:10.875 --> 1:47:13.625
and you made me want to see the world
in more than just black and white.

1:47:13.708 --> 1:47:16.166
And no one has ever done
anything like that for me before.

1:47:16.250 --> 1:47:18.583
And it made me realize

1:47:18.666 --> 1:47:20.375
<i>you</i> are my true love.

1:47:20.458 --> 1:47:23.541
-Oh my God, you've got the worst timing.
-No, really.

1:47:23.625 --> 1:47:26.291
I've thought it through,
and I… I love you, Agatha.

1:47:26.375 --> 1:47:27.791
Tedros, please, please stop.

1:47:29.125 --> 1:47:31.333
Rafal is using Sophie
to take down the schools.

1:47:32.333 --> 1:47:33.500
Uh, wait, who's Rafal?

1:47:52.625 --> 1:47:54.458
Sophie, what happened to you?

1:47:57.666 --> 1:47:59.416
-My God.
-Don't worry, Teddy.

1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:01.416
Should clear up by tomorrow.

1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:04.375
Try to look past it
and not ruin our evening.

1:48:05.541 --> 1:48:06.750
The Evers Ball!

1:48:07.416 --> 1:48:08.875
Ah!

1:48:08.958 --> 1:48:09.958
Here I am.

1:48:11.583 --> 1:48:13.000
You're taking <i>me, </i>remember?

1:48:14.125 --> 1:48:16.000
-You promised.
-Sophie, please.

1:48:16.083 --> 1:48:18.666
Quiet, Aggie.
The protagonists are speaking.

1:48:19.583 --> 1:48:21.916
-I'm still your date, right?

1:48:23.041 --> 1:48:24.916
You going back on your promise?

1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:26.166
Because…

1:48:27.041 --> 1:48:28.791
bad things happen…

1:48:28.875 --> 1:48:30.750
…when the Good
break their promises.

1:48:30.833 --> 1:48:32.875
There is no promise.

1:48:32.958 --> 1:48:35.041
You betrayed me. I'm here with Agatha.

1:48:35.541 --> 1:48:37.666
-No. Whoa, no. He's not.
-Liar.

1:48:49.541 --> 1:48:52.000
You know, I think
I'm really getting the hang of this.

1:48:52.083 --> 1:48:53.291
Sophie, stop.

1:48:54.125 --> 1:48:57.416
-Whatever's happened, I can help you.

1:48:58.666 --> 1:48:59.625
I'm your friend.

1:48:59.708 --> 1:49:01.083
No, Agatha.

1:49:02.500 --> 1:49:03.625
You're my nemesis.

1:49:03.708 --> 1:49:08.541
Which means our story can't end
until one of us is destroyed.

1:49:11.458 --> 1:49:12.750
Sophie.

1:49:18.791 --> 1:49:19.791
Bye.

1:49:35.208 --> 1:49:36.458
-Tedros.

1:49:36.958 --> 1:49:38.083
Come quick.

1:49:52.416 --> 1:49:55.333
So, does this mean the ball is canceled?

1:49:55.416 --> 1:49:56.666
We have to stop her.

1:49:56.750 --> 1:49:58.500
No, no, no. Nobody hurt Sophie.

1:49:58.583 --> 1:49:59.833
Look at what she's done.

1:49:59.916 --> 1:50:02.083
Our only hope is to kill her
before she destroys us all.

1:50:02.166 --> 1:50:04.416
Men, grab your weapons.

1:50:04.500 --> 1:50:06.166
-It's time to kill the witch!
-Stop!

1:50:06.250 --> 1:50:08.666
Evil attacks, Good defends, remember?

1:50:08.750 --> 1:50:10.000
You can't attack!

1:51:01.166 --> 1:51:02.708
My dear Nevers!

1:51:04.958 --> 1:51:06.583
We have guests.

1:51:06.666 --> 1:51:08.625
-How should we greet them?

1:51:08.708 --> 1:51:09.541
We'll kill 'em!

1:51:11.083 --> 1:51:12.791
Just leave them alone!

1:51:12.875 --> 1:51:15.875
Sophie, please. They were just scared
you were going to attack them.

1:51:15.958 --> 1:51:17.750
Now, why would we ever do that?

1:51:18.750 --> 1:51:21.500
That would be such an Evil thing to do.

1:51:25.791 --> 1:51:28.041
Let's show them
how Good we really are.

1:51:28.583 --> 1:51:30.333
-Let's dance.

1:51:33.916 --> 1:51:37.083
-Say hello to our guests.

1:51:37.166 --> 1:51:39.875
Here's some party favors, boys.

1:51:39.958 --> 1:51:40.833
Draw!

1:51:40.916 --> 1:51:42.541
Tedros, it's a trick!

1:51:42.625 --> 1:51:44.250
-Kill the witch!

1:51:45.125 --> 1:51:46.250
Fire!

1:51:55.291 --> 1:51:56.125
Well, now.

1:51:57.375 --> 1:52:01.041
If Evil attacks and Good defends,

1:52:01.125 --> 1:52:02.833
then it would appear

1:52:03.416 --> 1:52:05.500
that Good has become Evil.

1:52:06.833 --> 1:52:11.125
-And Evil has become Good.

1:52:11.208 --> 1:52:13.583
Oh, so Good.

1:53:09.750 --> 1:53:10.791
Get out, Tedros!

1:53:13.875 --> 1:53:17.250
-Teddy, we have so much to talk about.

1:53:18.416 --> 1:53:22.000
You and your little army just tried
to kill a roomful of innocent people.

1:53:23.375 --> 1:53:26.250
Now that is quite Evil indeed.

1:53:59.625 --> 1:54:02.708
Looks like someone's
been auditing Uglification.

1:54:04.375 --> 1:54:07.125
-No!

1:54:07.208 --> 1:54:08.500
Please, Sophie.

1:54:09.166 --> 1:54:10.750
You have to stop this!

1:54:10.833 --> 1:54:11.916
It's too late.

1:54:12.750 --> 1:54:13.666
They attacked.

1:54:13.750 --> 1:54:15.125
Now we defend!

1:54:41.166 --> 1:54:42.500
Stop!

1:54:53.083 --> 1:54:55.125
Who wants hot chocolate?

1:55:16.250 --> 1:55:19.166
Call yourself a prince, Teddy?

1:55:26.250 --> 1:55:27.958
No!

1:55:45.375 --> 1:55:48.041
Ooh.

1:55:50.416 --> 1:55:53.291
-Aww!

1:56:13.375 --> 1:56:14.916
No, listen! Wait!

1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:16.708
Just listen to me!

1:56:43.458 --> 1:56:44.625
Yeah!

1:57:02.583 --> 1:57:03.750
Coming, my queen!

1:57:04.875 --> 1:57:06.833
-Whoo!

1:57:06.916 --> 1:57:08.208
No! Tedros!

1:57:08.291 --> 1:57:11.708
That felt wonderful.
Been dying to do that all semester.

1:57:11.791 --> 1:57:14.000
Tedros! Oh, Tedros! No!

1:57:16.333 --> 1:57:17.708
Back off, Aggie!

1:57:19.125 --> 1:57:20.583
This is my happy ending.

1:57:20.666 --> 1:57:23.625
So this is how you change the world?

1:57:23.708 --> 1:57:27.250
This is what you've always wanted?
To simply have it all at your feet?

1:57:28.666 --> 1:57:32.250
Yup. The only mistake I made
was thinking I needed to switch schools.

1:57:32.333 --> 1:57:35.375
It was just the schools
that needed to switch.

1:57:35.458 --> 1:57:38.791
The mistake you made
was thinking you needed any of this.

1:57:39.416 --> 1:57:40.916
Look what it's done to you!

1:57:42.083 --> 1:57:44.875
Look at what it has done to <i>us.</i>

1:57:44.958 --> 1:57:47.125
Sophie, Rafal is the enemy.

1:57:47.208 --> 1:57:48.916
-We have to defeat him.

1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:52.416
-I'd rather defeat my nemesis.

1:57:52.500 --> 1:57:53.666
Sophie, don't!

1:57:53.750 --> 1:57:55.583
No! No! Oh my--

1:57:55.666 --> 1:57:56.791
Sophie!

1:57:58.916 --> 1:58:03.541
Now…
just one last score to settle.

1:58:17.791 --> 1:58:20.166
-School Master.

1:58:20.250 --> 1:58:22.000
Where are you, old man?

1:58:22.875 --> 1:58:24.291
Time to pay for your mistake!

1:58:24.375 --> 1:58:25.958
Seeking revenge,

1:58:26.041 --> 1:58:27.750
Sophie searched the tower

1:58:27.833 --> 1:58:31.666
for the one person
who had wronged her from the start.

1:58:32.250 --> 1:58:34.083
Or so she believed.

1:58:34.875 --> 1:58:36.166
What does that mean?

1:58:37.625 --> 1:58:40.666
It means your tale has just begun,
Sophie of Gavaldon.

1:58:43.833 --> 1:58:44.833
Rafal.

1:58:45.375 --> 1:58:48.583
This was all a test, Sophie.

1:58:49.166 --> 1:58:50.333
All of it.

1:58:50.416 --> 1:58:53.791
A test… to find my true love.

1:58:55.125 --> 1:58:56.291
I don't understand.

1:58:56.375 --> 1:59:00.333
I was the one who answered your wish
and brought you here.

1:59:00.916 --> 1:59:05.958
The seers told me of your potential,
and I wanted to help you fulfill it.

1:59:06.041 --> 1:59:07.583
Who else has believed in you…

1:59:09.750 --> 1:59:10.750
cared for you,

1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:13.166
defended you,

1:59:13.875 --> 1:59:16.333
given you everything?

1:59:18.500 --> 1:59:20.166
When you use that power,

1:59:20.916 --> 1:59:23.125
and watch your enemies fall,

1:59:24.750 --> 1:59:26.666
how does it feel?

1:59:26.750 --> 1:59:29.041
-I like it.

1:59:30.083 --> 1:59:32.125
You were never meant for Good.

1:59:32.208 --> 1:59:33.666
And of course, neither was I.

1:59:35.916 --> 1:59:38.166
Why did you pose as the School Master?

1:59:38.250 --> 1:59:39.916
<i>He was my brother.</i>

1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:41.625
<i>Centuries ago,</i>

1:59:42.125 --> 1:59:44.958
we were entrusted the Storian for eternity

1:59:45.041 --> 1:59:48.625
because our bond
overrode our warring souls.

1:59:48.708 --> 1:59:53.625
As long as we protected each other,
we would stay immortal… and young.

1:59:54.416 --> 1:59:58.625
Good and Evil, in perfect balance.

2:00:00.083 --> 2:00:01.166
But time…

2:00:03.333 --> 2:00:05.791
time makes one discontent.

2:00:06.375 --> 2:00:07.333
What happened to him?

2:00:07.416 --> 2:00:09.958
<i>We fought…</i>

2:00:12.250 --> 2:00:13.833
<i>…</i>and I killed him.

2:00:34.291 --> 2:00:35.583
<i>You killed your brother?</i>

2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:40.125
How could you do that?

2:00:40.208 --> 2:00:43.458
Well, the same way
you tried to kill your beloved prince.

2:00:43.541 --> 2:00:46.333
Because it's who we are.

2:00:47.083 --> 2:00:48.458
After my brother's death,

2:00:49.083 --> 2:00:52.583
I assumed his identity
to hide my true intent.

2:00:52.666 --> 2:00:54.708
<i>Started destroying the balance</i>
<i>from within.</i>

2:00:54.791 --> 2:00:59.458
There are no mistakes
in the School for Good and Evil.

2:00:59.541 --> 2:01:01.833
But Good has won for 200 years.

2:01:01.916 --> 2:01:04.666
Oh, have they now?

2:01:05.166 --> 2:01:06.958
Story by story, I have corrupted them.

2:01:07.041 --> 2:01:10.583
Rewarding them for burning old ladies
in ovens,

2:01:10.666 --> 2:01:12.666
making mermaids cut out their tongues,

2:01:12.750 --> 2:01:15.458
forcing women to dance
in red-hot iron shoes.

2:01:16.166 --> 2:01:17.500
Good became vain.

2:01:18.500 --> 2:01:19.333
Foolish.

2:01:21.416 --> 2:01:22.416
Weak.

2:01:23.541 --> 2:01:24.875
But you, Sophie?

2:01:24.958 --> 2:01:26.375
You put me to shame.

2:01:26.875 --> 2:01:29.583
You brought the whole school
to its knees in weeks.

2:01:29.666 --> 2:01:32.250
Beyond Good and Evil, you…

2:01:33.333 --> 2:01:35.041
are chaos itself.

2:01:35.541 --> 2:01:39.166
-And together, we are unstoppable.

2:01:39.250 --> 2:01:40.250
Agatha!

2:01:40.333 --> 2:01:42.375
-Tedros?

2:01:42.458 --> 2:01:43.458
Hey.

2:01:45.875 --> 2:01:46.791
You all right?

2:01:46.875 --> 2:01:49.083
Oh my God, I thought you were dead.

2:01:49.166 --> 2:01:51.166
I'm fine. Listen to me.

2:01:51.250 --> 2:01:53.583
I need to put an end to the Nevers,
once and for all.

2:01:53.666 --> 2:01:55.000
No, no, no, Tedros.

2:01:55.083 --> 2:01:59.000
This whole war thing
between the schools, it's all wrong.

2:01:59.083 --> 2:02:01.250
-If I can get through to Sophie--
-After what she's done?

2:02:01.333 --> 2:02:02.833
No point. No way. It's not gonna work.

2:02:02.916 --> 2:02:05.666
No, no, no. She's being used
by the School Master's brother.

2:02:05.750 --> 2:02:07.791
He's given her blood magic,
and it's too much for her.

2:02:07.875 --> 2:02:10.333
-She doesn't know what she's doing.
-No, she knows.

2:02:10.416 --> 2:02:11.916
I can reach her.

2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.166
-I know it.
-Listen to me.

2:02:14.250 --> 2:02:15.625
-What?
-She's gone.

2:02:15.708 --> 2:02:18.250
She turned into a raven
and went up to the School Master's tower.

2:02:19.125 --> 2:02:21.291
-What?
-The fight's down here, Agatha.

2:02:21.958 --> 2:02:23.208
It's time to let her go.

2:02:23.291 --> 2:02:26.041
Tedros, you told me
you were ready to see the world

2:02:26.125 --> 2:02:27.666
in more than just black and white.

2:02:28.416 --> 2:02:30.208
-Mm-hmm.
-This is your chance.

2:02:30.291 --> 2:02:32.916
Please, I just need you to trust me.

2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.958
Come with me to save Sophie.
That is how we'll save the school.

2:02:36.041 --> 2:02:39.208
-Evers <i>and </i>Nevers.

2:02:39.291 --> 2:02:41.375
-Please.
-Tedros, help! We can't hold them.

2:02:41.458 --> 2:02:42.708
Okay. Go to her.

2:02:42.791 --> 2:02:45.250
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I promise you.

2:02:47.916 --> 2:02:50.583
-And will you join me, Sophie?

2:02:50.666 --> 2:02:53.250
All we need is our true love's kiss,

2:02:53.333 --> 2:02:57.083
Evil's kiss, to unlock our love

2:02:57.166 --> 2:02:59.875
and forever open the gates to Never After

2:03:01.166 --> 2:03:03.666
for you and I…

2:03:05.500 --> 2:03:06.791
to rule.

2:03:09.333 --> 2:03:11.333
I am your prince.

2:03:13.416 --> 2:03:15.000
I am your true love.

2:03:16.750 --> 2:03:18.125
I always have been.

2:03:20.333 --> 2:03:23.791
Will you join me?

2:03:27.458 --> 2:03:30.083
Yes. Yes.

2:03:32.916 --> 2:03:38.083
And so it was that Evil
had finally won true love's kiss,

2:03:38.166 --> 2:03:42.458
condemning both schools
and all those within their walls,

2:03:42.541 --> 2:03:44.458
Good and Evil alike,

2:03:44.541 --> 2:03:46.750
to perish in agony,

2:03:46.833 --> 2:03:49.291
-allowing Rafal's Evil…
-Yes!

2:03:49.375 --> 2:03:53.000
…true Evil, to overtake the world.

2:03:53.083 --> 2:03:54.750
What have I done?

2:03:54.833 --> 2:03:57.500
-Why does anyone have to die?

2:03:57.583 --> 2:04:00.583
I thought you wanted Evil to win.
Those are my friends.

2:04:00.666 --> 2:04:04.750
<i>They are merely fairy-tale Evil.</i>

2:04:04.833 --> 2:04:08.750
<i>We must wipe the slate clean</i>
<i>to make way for true Evil.</i>

2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.333
Welcome to Never After, my love.

2:04:28.416 --> 2:04:31.125
No! I didn't want to hurt them.

2:04:31.208 --> 2:04:32.916
I thought you said we'd just rule them.

2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:36.708
And we <i>will</i> rule Never After,

2:04:36.791 --> 2:04:38.625
where every one of those students,

2:04:38.708 --> 2:04:40.125
every professor,

2:04:40.208 --> 2:04:43.333
anyone who could challenge us, is dead.

2:04:43.416 --> 2:04:47.375
Including… your nemesis.

2:04:52.583 --> 2:04:53.583
Oh!

2:04:54.958 --> 2:04:57.250
No, Aggie!

2:04:58.083 --> 2:04:59.666
This is not what I wanted!

2:04:59.750 --> 2:05:02.166
Oh, it's too late for that now, Sophie.

2:05:02.250 --> 2:05:04.416
You've driven away everyone,

2:05:04.500 --> 2:05:09.083
lied to everyone, betrayed everyone.

2:05:09.166 --> 2:05:11.125
You're all alone now.

2:05:11.208 --> 2:05:13.083
That's why you're mine.

2:05:13.166 --> 2:05:14.333
Get away from her!

2:05:17.208 --> 2:05:18.416
Aggie!

2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:19.875
You're alive?

2:05:20.833 --> 2:05:23.916
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay. I got you.

2:05:24.541 --> 2:05:27.583
You know, I expected more from a Reader.

2:05:28.500 --> 2:05:32.250
Surely you know
what happens to those who thwart love.

2:05:32.333 --> 2:05:33.750
Love?

2:05:34.333 --> 2:05:35.625
This isn't love.

2:05:35.708 --> 2:05:37.916
Do you know why Good always wins?

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.625
Because we fight for each other,
and we care for each other.

2:05:41.708 --> 2:05:44.083
<i>That</i> is what Good's love is.

2:05:44.166 --> 2:05:46.333
Evil only fights for itself.

2:05:47.791 --> 2:05:50.166
And that is the furthest thing
from love on Earth.

2:05:51.875 --> 2:05:53.500
Such beautiful words

2:05:54.541 --> 2:05:57.291
that have no power or meaning anymore.

2:05:57.375 --> 2:05:59.958
Now, if you'll please
step away from my bride.

2:06:00.041 --> 2:06:02.791
You will never have her, you monster.

2:06:03.791 --> 2:06:05.375
Not as long as I'm alive.

2:06:05.958 --> 2:06:06.958
Oh.

2:06:08.041 --> 2:06:09.041
Well, as you wish.

2:06:12.166 --> 2:06:14.416
-No! Not Aggie!

2:06:16.541 --> 2:06:18.750
-Sophie!

2:06:18.833 --> 2:06:21.166
-Sophie?

2:06:21.250 --> 2:06:24.458
-No. No!

2:06:43.666 --> 2:06:44.583
It can't be.

2:06:45.666 --> 2:06:47.208
Not after all this.

2:07:03.083 --> 2:07:04.375
No.

2:07:14.875 --> 2:07:17.375
-It's okay.

2:07:19.416 --> 2:07:21.666
No. No, no, no.

2:07:49.166 --> 2:07:52.583
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

2:07:52.666 --> 2:07:54.250
-In <i>my </i>school?

2:07:55.875 --> 2:07:59.333
In your father's hands,
that sword might once have vanquished me.

2:08:00.041 --> 2:08:04.333
But in the hands
of his ridiculous whelp of a son,

2:08:04.416 --> 2:08:06.833
it is merely an oversized butter knife.

2:08:26.291 --> 2:08:27.708
You think this tale…

2:08:29.625 --> 2:08:31.958
is about <i>your</i> true love.

2:08:32.583 --> 2:08:35.708
No, it's about <i>mine.</i>

2:08:39.791 --> 2:08:43.500
And the power Evil's kiss gave me

2:08:43.583 --> 2:08:46.291
to kill Good's future king.

2:08:46.375 --> 2:08:48.208
Or the tale of the girls who stopped you.

2:09:30.125 --> 2:09:32.125
The end.

2:09:35.375 --> 2:09:36.375
Oh my God.

2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.458
-Hey. Oh my God.

2:09:41.541 --> 2:09:43.166
Oh my God. It's okay.

2:09:43.250 --> 2:09:45.125
Hey. Hi.

2:09:46.708 --> 2:09:47.708
Aggie…

2:09:49.750 --> 2:09:51.541
I'm so sorry for everything.

2:09:51.625 --> 2:09:54.333
Shh. You're fine. You're okay.

2:09:55.041 --> 2:09:56.333
You're safe now.

2:09:57.500 --> 2:09:59.000
I don't wanna be Evil.

2:09:59.083 --> 2:10:00.750
No, you are not Evil.

2:10:01.791 --> 2:10:03.416
You're just human.

2:10:05.375 --> 2:10:06.875
As long as I have you.

2:10:08.625 --> 2:10:10.375
We will always have each other.

2:10:11.583 --> 2:10:13.666
You promise?

2:10:15.958 --> 2:10:16.958
I promise.

2:10:17.458 --> 2:10:18.291
Good.

2:10:23.750 --> 2:10:25.458
I love you, Aggie.

2:10:26.750 --> 2:10:30.291
You'll always be… my best friend.

2:10:34.083 --> 2:10:36.208
Hey. Hey.

2:10:37.416 --> 2:10:38.416
No.

2:10:42.083 --> 2:10:44.291
No, please come back.

2:10:58.125 --> 2:10:59.500
I love you too.

2:11:15.791 --> 2:11:16.791
Oh God.

2:11:39.083 --> 2:11:40.291
Oh my God.

2:11:41.583 --> 2:11:43.666
-Oh!

2:11:52.291 --> 2:11:54.625
Hi. Hi.

2:11:55.208 --> 2:11:56.708
-Hi.
-Hey.

2:11:58.250 --> 2:12:00.291
Hey.

2:12:06.291 --> 2:12:08.791
Oh, I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

2:12:08.875 --> 2:12:10.000
Oh my God.

2:12:11.041 --> 2:12:13.041
Don't ever do that again.

2:12:17.041 --> 2:12:18.041
Let's go home.

2:12:20.375 --> 2:12:21.500
Yeah.

2:12:21.583 --> 2:12:22.708
Let's go home.

2:12:29.583 --> 2:12:35.125
And so it was that our heroes
defeated the greatest threat

2:12:35.208 --> 2:12:39.541
the School for Good and Evil
had ever known.

2:12:50.791 --> 2:12:54.625
<i>The world of fairy tales</i>
<i>had not perished,</i>

2:12:55.333 --> 2:12:59.375
<i>but it had been changed forever.</i>

2:12:59.458 --> 2:13:01.458
-Good and Evil together?

2:13:02.625 --> 2:13:04.458
-One school?

2:13:05.458 --> 2:13:06.416
Hmm.

2:13:06.500 --> 2:13:07.750
Now what?

2:13:07.833 --> 2:13:10.708
Unity, perhaps.

2:13:12.541 --> 2:13:16.250
Maybe… friendship, even.

2:13:18.208 --> 2:13:19.250
Hmm.

2:13:23.958 --> 2:13:25.500
Mm.

2:13:32.500 --> 2:13:33.458
Well…

2:13:33.541 --> 2:13:37.708
-Well, no rush. No rush.
-No. Slow and steady wins the race.

2:13:43.375 --> 2:13:44.250
Hi there.

2:13:44.750 --> 2:13:46.166
My heart belongs to another.

2:13:57.750 --> 2:14:02.833
<i>As for our two heroes,</i>
<i>there was finally a way back to Gavaldon,</i>

2:14:02.916 --> 2:14:06.291
<i>as Agatha's kiss had set them free.</i>

2:14:07.291 --> 2:14:12.000
<i>For what is truer</i>
<i>than the love between friends?</i>

2:14:12.083 --> 2:14:13.875
It's definitely best if I go.

2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:19.625
Aggie, if you want to stay here
with Tedros, I understand.

2:14:23.125 --> 2:14:24.541
I'll take care of your mom.

2:14:25.750 --> 2:14:27.000
It would be my honor.

2:14:28.375 --> 2:14:30.250
Thank you, Sophie.

2:14:49.583 --> 2:14:51.958
-But I can't leave my friend.

2:14:55.750 --> 2:14:59.500
Thank you, Tedros, for wanting to change.

2:15:01.750 --> 2:15:05.000
I hope we'll see each other again someday.

2:15:19.666 --> 2:15:21.708
Wait! Wait!

2:15:55.375 --> 2:15:58.291
<i>Both girls were met with open arms…</i>

2:16:00.708 --> 2:16:02.416
<i>…and open minds.</i>

2:16:02.916 --> 2:16:05.541
<i>They never felt so special.</i>

2:16:13.041 --> 2:16:14.791
-Oh!
-Oh no!

2:16:14.875 --> 2:16:17.791
-Hey!

2:16:17.875 --> 2:16:20.750
<i>Although some things never change.</i>

2:16:24.541 --> 2:16:26.833
-Witch! Witch!
-Burn! Witch!

2:16:28.291 --> 2:16:32.041
<i>That is,</i>
<i>unless you use your power</i>

2:16:32.125 --> 2:16:33.625
<i>to begin to change them.</i>

2:16:41.583 --> 2:16:42.708
Ew!

2:16:53.625 --> 2:16:57.541
<i>And that,</i>
<i>you could say, is the end of our story.</i>

2:17:01.333 --> 2:17:07.250
<i>However, as Tedros's arrow</i>
<i>pierced the vortex between their worlds…</i>

2:17:08.125 --> 2:17:11.083
<i>I need you, Agatha.</i>

2:17:11.166 --> 2:17:15.083
<i>…it became clear</i>
<i>that this was only…</i>

2:17:16.750 --> 2:17:17.833
<i>…the beginning.</i>
