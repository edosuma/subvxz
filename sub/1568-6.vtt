WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.086
Previously on "The 100"...

00:05.631 --> 00:07.382
Welcome
to Mount Weather.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.221
So we meet again.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.555
Clarke, no!
If you pull that lever,

00:14.765 --> 00:15.807
these people will die.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.266
Even a little radiation
could kill them.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.601
- It was a containment breach.
- Help!

00:18.769 --> 00:22.146
Your circulatory systems developed
the ability to filter radiation.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.149
If we were to circulate Maya's blood
through your system...

00:25.359 --> 00:26.484
It could
make her better?

00:26.694 --> 00:29.821
The first human trial
was a success.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.115
Why bring them here,
if not to use them?

00:32.324 --> 00:33.324
I saw everything.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.909
I know what you're
doing to them.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.747
We have to
get them out.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.165
We gather intel
on Mount Weather

00:41.375 --> 00:43.209
and we send a team
after Kane.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.752
Where's Finn?
Looking for you.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.588
Where is the girl who was
wearing this watch?!

00:50.676 --> 00:52.635
Your friends are not here.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.305
We need to go! Finn!

01:04.398 --> 01:06.065
I found you.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.253
OK, tell me again.

01:27.463 --> 01:28.546
It's a labyrinth.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.173
We got to the dam
through this tunnel.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.716
It's all connected
to the mine system.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.052
That's our way in.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.221
Sure, if we can get past the reapers
and the Mountain men.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.141
I swear to God,
if your mom doesn't

01:40.350 --> 01:42.435
sanction a mission soon,
I'm going by myself.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.645
You won't be by yourself.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.904
Guess the
inquisition's over.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.866
How's Finn doing,
anyway?

01:57.076 --> 01:59.118
I haven't talked to him
since we got back.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.206
I don't know what to say.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.542
He just kept shooting.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.836
We're at war, Clarke.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.589
We've all done things.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.883
Hey.

02:14.093 --> 02:16.052
Hey.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.308
Next round's on me.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.947
Mount Weather?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.532
What's the plan?

02:37.741 --> 02:40.118
Still working on it.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.286
Ah! Check it out.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.622
Salvaged Monty's still
from the drop ship.

02:44.832 --> 02:49.085
Now, I guess, you know,
if they could just salvage Monty, huh?

02:49.294 --> 02:50.878
Easy. It was just a joke.

02:53.799 --> 02:57.552
OK. You, uh, tell her
we were cleared?

02:58.887 --> 03:00.012
No.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.889
Well, it looks like
our pardon

03:02.099 --> 03:04.350
for surviving includes
our time on the ground.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.435
Now bigger fish
to fry, I guess.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.604
We did what we
had to do.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.316
I got to go.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.945
Trouble in paradise?

03:17.531 --> 03:21.534
Just because they pardoned
you doesn't mean I have.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.666
Clarke.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.418
Beat it, Murphy.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.421
Well, then,
have a good one.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.174
I know why we
haven't heard

03:36.383 --> 03:38.968
from any of the other
ark stations.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.553
Mount Weather's
jamming us.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.890
Show me.

03:50.189 --> 03:53.441
I tweaked the resonator
and got this.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.070
It's on
every frequency.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.448
Long-range communication
is totally screwed.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.783
It's also why the range
in our walkies sucks.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.785
It's the same signal
Monty heard

04:04.995 --> 04:06.954
on the black box
of the exodus ship.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.332
Mount Weather crashed
the exodus ship.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.833
Can you get around
the signal?

04:11.043 --> 04:12.376
Around it? No.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.921
But if I can get to the tower that
broadcasts it,

04:15.130 --> 04:17.298
I can make it go boom.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.550
No one is
going anywhere.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.968
Mom, listen to me--
what do I have to do

04:21.136 --> 04:22.386
to get through to you?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.388
You and your friends
are not soldiers,

04:24.598 --> 04:26.390
and continuing
to act like you are

04:26.600 --> 04:27.975
puts lives at risk.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.354
You don't understand.
Raven found something.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.689
Mount Weather is jamming
our communications.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.984
It's true. There could be other
ark stations on the ground.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.403
And more guards. You said we don't
have enough people

04:39.613 --> 04:40.988
to fight
a two-front war.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.574
Mom, we're already
fighting one.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.952
The grounder retaliation
for the massacre could

04:46.161 --> 04:48.454
happen at any time, and
when it does, we need

04:48.664 --> 04:50.456
every available man
to defend this camp.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.875
So let us go.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.585
You're not gonna
stop, are you?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.420
Not until
my friends are safe.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.385
OK.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.221
But I'm coming
with you.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.056
Ma'am, I just said--

05:07.266 --> 05:09.141
it's been quiet
for two days.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.686
Maybe Kane is making headway with the
grounders' commander.

05:11.895 --> 05:15.523
Or maybe he's dead, and they're
massing against us as we speak.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.276
Maybe...

05:18.485 --> 05:20.903
Which is why we need
more guards.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.574
Then it's settled.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.537
We're going back
to Mount Weather.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.201
Sir, it's been 3 days

06:09.411 --> 06:11.704
and Maya's numbers
are still climbing.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.040
It's too soon
to be sure, but I believe

06:14.249 --> 06:18.419
she may actually be metabolizing
radiation on her own now.

06:22.507 --> 06:25.384
Jasper's blood was
8 times more effective

06:25.594 --> 06:27.887
than any outsider
we've ever measured.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.723
I'm still running tests,
but his system

06:30.932 --> 06:33.017
appears to have
jump-started hers.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.811
You're saying that it's
a permanent solution?

06:36.021 --> 06:37.646
Maya can survive
on the ground?

06:37.856 --> 06:40.107
I'm saying it's possible.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.400
I'll keep watching her.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.819
In the meantime, sir,
you have to let me

06:44.029 --> 06:45.988
move forward with
the rest of the 47.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.456
No.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.501
Dad, I--I agree
with her.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.086
I know that
the plan was to

07:00.295 --> 07:01.879
assimilate them
into the gene pool,

07:02.089 --> 07:04.965
but this changes
everything.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.551
She just said
it's not proven.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.303
Mr. president,

07:09.513 --> 07:12.139
even if it's not
a permanent solution,

07:12.349 --> 07:13.766
with their blood,

07:13.975 --> 07:16.519
we'll need fewer treatments,
we'll live longer,

07:16.728 --> 07:18.437
and we'll feel better.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.439
Jasper volunteered.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.775
I will not put
those kids in cages

07:22.984 --> 07:24.068
like animals.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.154
No one wants that.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.615
If you can convince
the rest of them to volunteer,

07:29.825 --> 07:32.118
great, but what
if you can't?

07:33.620 --> 07:36.247
Every day, you paint
the outside,

07:36.456 --> 07:39.166
and if Dr. Tsing is
right about this,

07:39.376 --> 07:42.378
then you might
be able to see it again, dad.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.551
Listen to me.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.220
You need
to understand this.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.265
If I give the order
to harvest those kids,

07:54.474 --> 07:57.351
I won't deserve
to see it again.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.067
Where are you going?

08:07.112 --> 08:09.655
To find you
some volunteers.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.204
Ahem.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.456
He'll come around.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.082
What if he doesn't?

08:20.292 --> 08:23.252
What if they don't
volunteer?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.882
Then we'll have
to do it anyway.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.556
I can't believe
they let Finn come.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.808
He's the best tracker
we've got.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.643
Don't forget to look up.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.854
The grounders use
the trees.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.106
That's how we lost
John Mbege.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.611
You were right
to have me bring them.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.738
Don't worry.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.950
Your guards will
get there.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.997
I know you're
worried about Finn.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.918
Thank you for voting
to clear him.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.879
Thought he was
rescuing his friends.

09:07.088 --> 09:11.008
The real question is, is he
going to be able to clear himself?

09:19.726 --> 09:22.019
Kane, stop.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.104
If they wanted
to kill us,

09:24.314 --> 09:26.607
they would have
done it already.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.610
Oh, two days
without food or water.

09:29.819 --> 09:30.945
Come on.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.655
How many times on
the ark did we go

09:32.864 --> 09:34.949
two days
without water?

09:35.158 --> 09:36.700
This...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.537
This is not how our
story ends, Marcus.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.789
We wind up in the
same train station

09:41.998 --> 09:43.832
on the ground

09:44.042 --> 09:45.918
just to die in it?

09:48.046 --> 09:50.381
We still got work
to do.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.008
How can you be so sure?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.971
My son told me.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.251
Stop!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.753
We came in peace.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.214
We came in peace!
Please!

10:41.891 --> 10:43.684
You speak of peace

10:43.893 --> 10:47.146
while you send an assassin
into one of my villages.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.148
What are you
talking about?

10:49.357 --> 10:52.067
Blood...Must have blood.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.032
One of you will die

10:58.241 --> 11:01.452
here, today,
by the other's hand.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.038
I will hear the terms
of your surrender

11:04.247 --> 11:06.457
from the man who lives.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.239
They want us to turn
on each other.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.409
They want justice.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.252
Lives have been lost
on both sides.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.884
That's why we need
to end this war!

12:16.152 --> 12:17.945
What's your name?

12:19.531 --> 12:20.989
Lexa.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.950
Lexa.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.953
I'm Thelonious...

12:26.162 --> 12:28.706
And this is Marcus.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.835
Your commander spoke of

12:33.044 --> 12:35.421
an assassin
in a village?

12:37.132 --> 12:38.674
Yes.

12:38.883 --> 12:42.219
Eighteen of our people
were murdered.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.471
Elders...

12:44.681 --> 12:46.849
Children.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.772
We have nothing
to do with that.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.816
It doesn't matter.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.319
The commander
thinks you did.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.072
One of you must
pick up the knife.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.284
That is our way.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.911
And if we refuse?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.252
Then the commander will use it
to slit both of your throats.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.351
Jasper.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.021
I'd hoped
to catch you

13:34.230 --> 13:35.981
before you were
discharged.

13:36.191 --> 13:39.067
I see I'm not the only one impressed
by your courage.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.069
Oh, I just did what
anyone would do.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.155
I'd like to
believe that's true.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.782
May I walk with you?

13:44.991 --> 13:46.742
Sure.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.952
After what happened
to Maya,

13:49.162 --> 13:52.039
I'm sure it won't come
as a surprise to you

13:52.248 --> 13:55.709
to learn that we're not
entirely safe here.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.087
Mount Weather wasn't built
to last this long.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.716
Over time, trace amounts
of radiation seep inside.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.719
The breach in the dorm is
an extreme example.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.055
We have methods
for dealing with this,

14:08.264 --> 14:10.474
but frankly,
those methods pale

14:10.683 --> 14:13.519
compared to what we saw
with you and Maya.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.521
Sir, I--

14:15.730 --> 14:17.689
I don't think I could
do that for everyone.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.150
Of course not,
but if you could

14:20.360 --> 14:23.570
inspire your friends
to follow your example,

14:23.780 --> 14:26.448
imagine the difference
you could make here.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.875
There. I see it.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.877
Here.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.220
It'll be dark soon.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.222
We'll never spot
the traps.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.976
We should set up camp here,
leave at first light.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.274
We're missing two.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.570
Where the hell are they?

15:04.779 --> 15:06.989
Bellamy! Octavia!

15:07.198 --> 15:09.366
Clarke, we're
in enemy territory,

15:09.576 --> 15:11.869
and their lives are
my responsibility.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.955
They went to find
a way in.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.749
A way in. That's not what
this mission is about.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.418
It is for them.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.046
Find them.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.673
Bring them back.
Yes, ma'am.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.675
You two with me.
Let's go.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.844
I'm going with them.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.804
Finn, wait.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.890
We need you here.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.934
Why? So you can keep
an eye on me?

15:38.563 --> 15:41.899
You'd have to be able to look
at me to do that.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.275
Finn--

15:43.484 --> 15:45.569
what do you think
I'm gonna do?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.321
Finn.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.119
I'll go get him.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.211
Finn! Come back.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.677
It was an accident.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.641
What was that?

16:17.852 --> 16:19.186
Run!

16:26.319 --> 16:27.819
Acid fog! Take cover!

16:28.029 --> 16:29.988
If you can hear me,
use the tents!

16:30.198 --> 16:32.574
My tent!
I forgot my pack!

16:32.784 --> 16:35.035
It's OK! We can make it
to the bunker!

16:36.913 --> 16:38.580
According to Clarke,
before the bombs,

16:38.790 --> 16:40.207
there were buildings
everywhere here.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.085
I'm guessing some of them
had access to the bunker.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.003
So we're looking
for ruins,

16:45.213 --> 16:47.255
anything that's
manmade, OK?

16:47.465 --> 16:49.341
Hey! Blake!

16:49.550 --> 16:51.551
Let's go, right now.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.387
In case
you've forgotten,

16:53.596 --> 16:54.638
we're not under
your command.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.889
Don't make us do this
the hard way.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.933
Come on, Scott,
47 of our people

16:58.142 --> 16:59.476
are prisoners
in this Mountain.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.353
And that's why we're out here.
Wrong.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.147
You're out here to find
other stations of the ark.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.233
We're out here to find
our friends.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.943
Bell.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.283
What are they doing?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.454
Running.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.750
Acid fog!

17:23.960 --> 17:25.335
We need cover! Now!

17:25.545 --> 17:26.753
Deploy the tents!
Let's go!

17:31.092 --> 17:33.051
Yeah, I got it.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.053
Let's get all
the canvas out now.

17:35.263 --> 17:38.348
O! O!

17:38.558 --> 17:40.142
Get back here!

17:41.728 --> 17:42.978
Bell!

17:43.187 --> 17:44.646
There's something in here.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.148
Maybe it's the ruins.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.649
Hey! Hey! Over here!

17:47.859 --> 17:50.402
Let's go!
Come on! Come on!

17:50.611 --> 17:52.571
I found it!

17:55.199 --> 17:57.034
Come on, pull.
Hurry up!

18:00.329 --> 18:03.206
Hey! Quick!
Get inside!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.751
Come on, move!
Let's go!

18:10.548 --> 18:13.133
Move! It's too late!

18:18.097 --> 18:20.307
You OK?

18:20.516 --> 18:22.184
Yeah, I'm OK.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.518
I'm OK.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.222
Clarke?

19:00.431 --> 19:02.224
Clarke, do you read me?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.602
We're closer
to the source.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.521
It's swallowing
short-range now, too.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.149
Clarke, do you read me?

19:11.359 --> 19:12.776
Damn it!

19:12.985 --> 19:14.319
Clarke and Finn
know these woods.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.571
She left her pack,
and her tent is in it.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.782
They'll find shelter.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.251
What is that?
I don't know.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.003
It sounds like they're jamming
every frequency but this one.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.922
You hear that?

19:34.132 --> 19:36.216
This one's clear.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.884
That sounds clear
to you?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.719
Will be once I crack
the encryption.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.721
OK, English, raven.
What does that mean?

19:41.931 --> 19:45.475
It means...We'll be able to listen in
on Mount Weather.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.104
Let's go.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.236
Where are we?

19:59.157 --> 20:00.991
Looks like a garage.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.576
More like a tomb.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.417
Look, I'm sorry
about your man,

20:10.626 --> 20:12.377
but we need to find
an access door to Mount Weather.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.546
Hey, not so fast.
Sir, that fog could keep us

20:14.755 --> 20:17.674
pinned down for another...

20:17.884 --> 20:20.385
We'll split up.
Be back here in 15.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.555
Be safe.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.100
Let's go.

20:37.653 --> 20:38.987
Stop.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.116
I'm sure they're fine.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.285
Everybody had tents.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.376
So first you can't
look at me,

20:53.586 --> 20:56.254
and now you're looking
at me like I'm the enemy.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.717
I'm not looking
at you like that.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.553
Well, you don't look at me
the way you used to.

21:13.064 --> 21:16.566
I've been waiting for the right moment
to give you this.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.319
It's starting to feel
like that moment might not come.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.287
I know how much
it means to you.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.417
Where did you get this?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.336
It was around his neck.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.483
Guys, think about everything
they've done for us.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.236
I mean, they gave us
shelter, clean clothes.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.821
They kept us safe
from the grounders.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.951
Miller? They saved
your life, right?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.287
Dude, you puked for 3 days.
That was different.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.580
The normal treatments
wouldn't be as bad.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.332
- So they say.
- So what, then?

22:14.542 --> 22:15.583
Only puking for one day?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.252
Nah. I'm out.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.920
Sorry, Jasper.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.006
I'm out, too.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.050
Come on!

22:24.260 --> 22:26.219
They gave us cake!

22:26.429 --> 22:29.014
I got a sign-up sheet.
Dude.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.808
What are you doing?
What?

22:32.018 --> 22:34.352
When did you start
working for them?

22:34.562 --> 22:35.687
You know what?

22:35.896 --> 22:37.105
Never mind.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.565
Now that you're better,

22:38.774 --> 22:40.442
I'm going after Clarke.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.777
Of course. Right on time.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.654
Hey, guys. Jasper.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.865
I'm so glad to see
you're feeling better.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.243
Thanks. I am.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.622
You look, um,
rested.

22:54.832 --> 22:58.251
Hey, it's pizza day.
Heh! Who's hungry?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.353
We don't have much time,
but we can talk freely here.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.272
What the hell
is going on?

23:19.482 --> 23:20.732
Maya?

23:20.941 --> 23:22.984
I'm sorry.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.652
About what? What?

23:24.862 --> 23:27.405
What do you mean,
it wasn't an accident?

23:27.615 --> 23:29.282
She means they exposed her
to radiation on purpose.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.368
I'm betting it was
to get you to agree

23:31.577 --> 23:33.536
to be
her blood brother.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.455
I knew it.
Clarke was right.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.499
Monty, be quiet.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.542
Did you know about this?

23:39.752 --> 23:42.045
No.
And why would they do that to you?

23:42.254 --> 23:45.757
Because the standard
treatment sucks compared to you.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.509
That's what Dante said.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.803
What's the standard
treatment?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.638
Through there.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.117
Oh, my God.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.786
Are those...

24:14.995 --> 24:16.913
All grounders?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.706
Wait a second.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.709
Why are you
showing us this?

24:21.919 --> 24:23.378
Because I'm afraid.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.004
Of what?

24:25.214 --> 24:27.924
That you're next.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.809
Who else knows about this?

24:38.018 --> 24:39.144
Everyone,

24:39.353 --> 24:40.687
but nobody talks
about it.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.648
We learn not
to ask questions.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.568
Look, without
the treatments, we'd die.

24:46.777 --> 24:47.944
What are we
supposed to do?

24:48.154 --> 24:49.320
Die.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.451
We have to get out
of here.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.119
Dante said we could
leave, right?

24:56.328 --> 24:57.787
He was lying.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.873
He knew I'd be
too scared to leave,

25:00.082 --> 25:03.585
just like he knew I'd do
what had to be done to save Maya.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.587
So we don't ask.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.589
If Clarke got out,
we can, too.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.216
You'll never make it.
Ever since Clarke disappeared,

25:10.426 --> 25:12.469
security all around
the Mountain has been increased.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.637
We have to try.
We're not leaving.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.891
I won't leave
the others behind.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.851
That means they
end up in there.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.312
What choice
do we have?

25:23.981 --> 25:25.899
We volunteer.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.153
What's taking so long?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.779
I've almost got it.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.740
They're using a type
of audio modulation here,

25:33.949 --> 25:35.200
like a feedback loop.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.618
I just need to pinpoint
the origin of the loop,

25:36.827 --> 25:38.870
hone in on
the pure transmission.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.539
I just need to find the right...

25:46.587 --> 25:48.671
...Side
and report back. Over.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.507
- You did it.
- Copy that.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.468
Checking the Western
boundary line. Stand by. Over.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.512
No signs of life. Over.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.555
Has the veil
lifted yet? Over.

25:57.765 --> 26:00.850
Negative, sir.
Coverage is still 90%. Over.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.435
Keep searching.

26:02.645 --> 26:03.686
When they pop above,

26:03.896 --> 26:06.648
hit them again.
Over and out.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.150
"The veil."

26:09.360 --> 26:10.818
They're talking
about the fog.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.820
It's a weapon.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.989
Which means
they attacked us.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.120
Sergeant Porter?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.122
Yes, ma'am?

26:23.332 --> 26:25.375
Build your bomb.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.545
When that fog lifts,
take the tower down.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.089
Copy?
I copy, ma'am.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.340
What's wrong?

26:32.550 --> 26:35.343
We're listening
to the enemy.

26:35.553 --> 26:38.304
Blow the antenna,
and we won't be able to do that.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.765
Don't blow it, and we
won't make contact with any other

26:40.975 --> 26:43.518
ark survivors, and we need those
reinforcements, raven.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.687
Tough call.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.022
I know what Clarke
would do.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.198
Man, I hate that sound.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.937
Check this out.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.369
Who's that?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.413
Blake!

27:45.623 --> 27:46.956
That you, Blake?

27:48.125 --> 27:49.834
I don't see
anything.

27:59.261 --> 28:02.722
♪♪ Ding dong ding dong ♪♪

28:02.931 --> 28:06.184
♪♪ ding dong ding dong... ♪♪

28:10.564 --> 28:12.190
Scott?

28:13.859 --> 28:15.652
Are you there?

28:28.832 --> 28:31.250
Bell, what's that?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.507
Reapers.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.016
O.
What?

28:47.226 --> 28:49.143
Take this.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.200
Don't.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.621
It's Lincoln.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.957
Lincoln.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.418
Lincoln, it's me.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.921
It's Octavia.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.552
Oh!
Octavia!

29:27.099 --> 29:28.850
Aah!

29:34.857 --> 29:36.524
Get up. Get up.

29:36.734 --> 29:39.110
We need to get
somewhere safe.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.575
This has gone on
long enough.

29:45.784 --> 29:49.120
There has to be some other way
to resolve this...

29:49.329 --> 29:51.372
Something that we
haven't thought of yet.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.416
There isn't.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.753
She's right.
They're not budging.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.010
We can offer a trade.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.889
These people are primitive.
I've seen how they live.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.057
Our technology,
our medicine.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.852
All we'd ask for
in return is peace.

30:13.061 --> 30:16.439
If we truly want peace...

30:16.648 --> 30:18.816
He told us how
to get it.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.402
Through murder?

30:21.612 --> 30:23.946
Through sacrifice.

30:39.797 --> 30:42.632
Marcus,
what are you doing?

30:42.841 --> 30:45.218
If we don't make a choice...

30:45.427 --> 30:48.012
Then we'll both die.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.268
And the killing won't end.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.157
There's only one way
out of this.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.337
You have to kill me.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.385
You have to do this.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.719
It's our only choice.

31:28.929 --> 31:31.222
Kane, no.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.723
They respect strength.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.350
Let's show them ours.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.436
I said...No.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.441
You did not
order the massacre.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.403
Not that one.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.656
Marcus, you don't
need redemption.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.784
The choice we made
on the ark was about survival.

31:51.994 --> 31:54.954
We did what we had to so that
the human race could survive.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.039
The human race was
already surviving.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.374
Then we did it
for our people!

31:58.584 --> 32:00.501
Yes, and now
we must do this.

32:02.379 --> 32:03.754
It's the only way.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.882
Not gonna happen.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.015
You're a good man,
Thelonious.

32:16.226 --> 32:19.645
I won't let you
die for me.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.355
Marcus, no!

32:26.612 --> 32:28.738
Come on.
Help us. Please.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.865
Please.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.915
Come on. Please.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.666
Thank you.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.173
I told you,

32:47.382 --> 32:49.216
we didn't come
all this way

32:49.426 --> 32:50.885
to die.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.141
Thelonious! No!

32:57.351 --> 32:59.518
I choose to live.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.191
He's a reaper?

33:06.693 --> 33:08.486
How is it even
possible?

33:08.695 --> 33:10.738
He just looked
right through me.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.241
Shh.
How?

33:14.451 --> 33:16.077
Huh?

33:18.121 --> 33:20.247
Did he see us?

33:20.457 --> 33:22.583
I don't know.

33:35.097 --> 33:36.889
Shh. Just listen to me.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.475
We'll get him back.
I promise.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.440
Take off these chains.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.819
Thelonious, please,
she's just an innocent girl.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.498
OK.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.772
You're the commander?

34:30.819 --> 34:33.112
I've learned much
about you.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.072
It's clear your intentions
are honorable.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.116
Your desire
for peace is true.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.916
Later we will talk.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.668
In the meantime,
your friend will be used

34:47.878 --> 34:49.253
to send a message.

34:49.463 --> 34:50.755
No.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.381
No. No.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.008
Don't look at him.
Stop!

34:55.427 --> 34:58.220
Stop!
Stop! Please!

35:05.645 --> 35:09.190
The massacre must be
answered.

35:09.399 --> 35:12.151
Blood must have blood.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.539
You sure you're
ready for this?

35:27.125 --> 35:30.086
OK. Draw him in.
I'll do the rest.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.389
Lincoln!

35:44.309 --> 35:45.684
Lincoln!

35:45.894 --> 35:47.770
Can you hear me?

35:54.611 --> 35:56.070
- I'm sorry.
- Hey!

36:06.331 --> 36:08.582
Now what?

36:08.792 --> 36:11.168
Now we take him home.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.138
The fog has cleared.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.190
Clarke?

36:37.779 --> 36:40.322
They were unarmed.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.950
We have to go.

36:44.661 --> 36:48.247
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.220
Neither do I.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.354
What have we become?

37:18.320 --> 37:21.155
And you're
all set, Monty.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.283
The general anesthetic
will take effect shortly.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.243
You won't feel
a thing.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.207
How high are you
right now?

37:31.416 --> 37:33.042
Oh, I almost don't care

37:33.251 --> 37:35.669
that there's a 6-inch
spike in my neck.

37:37.297 --> 37:38.756
Ohh.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.888
I must say I'm
impressed, Jasper,

37:46.097 --> 37:48.432
and deeply grateful.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.602
These are just
the first, sir.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.103
More will come.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.855
I have no doubt.

37:55.065 --> 37:58.108
You saved us, right?
It's the least we could do.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.587
You see, doctor?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.923
That's our future.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.885
You just have to have a little faith
in our shared humanity.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.516
I hope they're all
this compliant.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.519
Don't worry
about her, dad.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.814
Dr. Tsing isn't big on admitting
when she's wrong.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.857
But I got
to hand it to you.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.819
We're getting the most effective
treatments we've ever had,

38:42.028 --> 38:44.989
and it's all because
you asked nicely.

38:49.286 --> 38:51.745
You think I'm stupid?

38:51.955 --> 38:54.665
Tell me you weren't
behind the breach

38:54.874 --> 38:57.084
that almost
killed Maya.

38:57.294 --> 38:58.752
I wasn't.

38:58.962 --> 39:02.548
Dad, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't do that.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.384
I love you, cage,

39:05.593 --> 39:07.803
and there's been
a Wallace in this office

39:08.013 --> 39:10.723
since the bombs,
but if I find out

39:10.932 --> 39:13.475
that you're lying,
there won't be one

39:13.685 --> 39:15.519
after me.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.773
Am I making myself
clear?

39:26.990 --> 39:29.700
Check it out.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.535
I love this song.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.790
♪♪ Come fashion all the ♪♪

39:37.000 --> 39:39.835
♪♪ I know... ♪♪

39:40.045 --> 39:41.920
OK, it's safe
to talk.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.672
We bought ourselves some time,
but we're gonna need to recruit

39:43.882 --> 39:46.216
some of the others,
only people we trust.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.718
How much more time are we talking
about buying here?

39:47.927 --> 39:48.969
Exactly.

39:49.179 --> 39:51.221
Long enough for Clarke
to break us out.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.183
We don't even know
if Clarke's still alive.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.976
She has to be.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.021
Well, then she
better hurry the hell up.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.791
Bellamy and Octavia?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.376
They know to
rendezvous here.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.419
Have you tried
to radio?

40:22.629 --> 40:25.089
Still jammed.
You didn't blow the tower.

40:25.298 --> 40:28.050
Raven figured out a way that
we could listen to Mount Weather.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.886
If we took out the antenna,
we wouldn't be able to do that.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.390
What about the other
ark stations?

40:34.641 --> 40:36.475
We don't know
if they made it.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.936
What we do know is
that 47 of our people

40:39.145 --> 40:41.021
are being held prisoner
on that Mountain.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.273
We're gonna
get them out.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.199
I'm sorry.

40:53.827 --> 40:56.787
We all have
battle scars, Finn.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.457
Suck it up...

41:00.667 --> 41:03.252
And build a brace
for yours.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.755
Help!

41:06.965 --> 41:08.715
Stay here, chancellor.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.509
Help me!

41:11.761 --> 41:13.720
Show us your hands.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.188
Stand down.

41:27.152 --> 41:28.652
Thelonious.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.666
I have a message

41:42.876 --> 41:44.835
from the commander.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.214
Leave...

41:49.424 --> 41:52.009
Or die.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.679
We have two days.
