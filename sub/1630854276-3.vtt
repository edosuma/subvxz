Donald, if we get this right,
if we get a win,

Your case could inspire

just to be brave enough

No, it's not about that.

04:34.808 --> 04:35.707
But she hasn't
reached out.

04:35.842 --> 04:36.708
Well that means

04:36.843 --> 04:37.843
She didn't sign the
declaration veto,

04:37.978 --> 04:39.310

so sure now.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.082
Look, I get it.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.250
You're afraid that the reality
of meeting your birth mother

04:46.287 --> 04:47.185
Won't match up

04:47.321 --> 04:49.054
To whatever you got
going on in here.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.190
My advice?

04:52.192 --> 04:53.725
Do whatever you want.

Whatever's best for you.

04:56.297 --> 04:59.397

get what we want.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.673

Located on
first nations reserves.

Was in the seventh grade,

09:56.229 --> 09:58.964
They bussed a handful of
us in from the reserves.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.234
Anyway, I started talking about
residential schools in class

10:03.303 --> 10:07.038
And the teacher overheard me
and he cut me off and he said,

10:08.508 --> 10:10.976
"I know everything there is
to know about canadian history

10:11.111 --> 10:12.844
"and I've never heard that!"

10:14.982 --> 10:17.548
That grown adult man
even scowled at me.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.786
There was one other
native boy in the class

10:21.788 --> 10:23.654
And he got my attention
and whispered,

10:24.724 --> 10:25.857
"my family too."

10:25.992 --> 10:27.925
[solemn music]

10:27.961 --> 10:29.727
The rest of the kids
just stared at me.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.998
I knew right then that
something wasn't right.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.136
Iris:
<i> You never told me that.</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.472
<i> It must've been tough.</i>

10:41.808 --> 10:43.374
My point is that,

10:44.311 --> 10:47.745
This was being
hidden for so long.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.380
Intentionally.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.283
But we lived it.

10:52.352 --> 10:59.156
[melancholy music]

10:59.192 --> 11:00.358
Doug:
<i> Do you see this?</i>

11:00.493 --> 11:02.026
Iris:
<i> Looks like a diary.</i>

11:03.163 --> 11:05.396
It was written by someone
named sister theodore.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.530
Doug:
<i> Yeah, listen.</i>

11:06.566 --> 11:09.834

<i> I pray, I pray.</i>

11:22.716 --> 11:24.315
Huh.
-What?

11:25.819 --> 11:28.052
She recorded her concerns

11:28.121 --> 11:30.455
About how the children
were being treated.

Dr. Picard:
<i> What exactly are</i>
<i> you looking for?</i>

11:39.266 --> 11:42.166
I understand you did the autopsy
on a drowning victim last week.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.868
Basil allen.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.403
I'd like a copy of the report.

11:48.842 --> 11:52.076
<i> I can only release the</i>
<i> autopsy to next of kin</i>

superintendent's approval.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.647
Your mom knows that.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.049
She said you might be willing
to let me just take a look.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.551
Mmm.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.020
You kids never wanna
do it the right way.

12:08.027 --> 12:09.561
Well, it says here
his next-of-kin

12:09.563 --> 12:11.096
Is his mother jean allen.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.330
In jamaica.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.367
Tell me this.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.670
Are you comfortable declaring
basil allen's death an accident

12:19.706 --> 12:21.405
Precluding any
further investigation

12:21.441 --> 12:23.575
Into the cause of death?

12:23.577 --> 12:25.109
What are you talking about?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.510
I made a full
report to the rcmp,

12:26.546 --> 12:29.313
Stating that the victim died
from a blow to the head.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.318
I don't decide who they
charge or don't charge.

still be some records

motherhouse in quebec

13:43.990 --> 13:45.556
Fifteen years ago.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.794
This is a staff photo from when
the school was still operating?

13:49.929 --> 13:52.196
Yes, it's from the early 80s.

13:52.265 --> 13:56.134
Um, this is sister theodore
and sister mary grace

13:56.136 --> 13:58.403

<i> day school faculty.</i>

13:58.538 --> 14:00.638

for me to get a copy?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.273
No, I'm-I'm sorry.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.010
We can't have anything
to do with this case.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.280
This mission was not
responsible for the day school

14:09.415 --> 14:10.748
<i> And now we're getting</i>
<i> all the blame.</i>

14:10.750 --> 14:13.817
But ignoring the church's
role in the abuses that happened

14:13.854 --> 14:15.986
Doesn't erase history.

what happened back then.

corroborate what she wrote.

have heard the case.

Conducted general check ups,
that sort of thing.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.280
Can you speak to the general
health of the students

19:42.282 --> 19:44.348
That you observed
during your visits?

19:44.350 --> 19:47.351
Yes, uh, I frequently
encountered children

19:47.420 --> 19:49.820
Who had visible bruises,

19:49.822 --> 19:52.623
<i> Lesions, cracked teeth.</i>

19:52.659 --> 19:55.592
Did they ever explain how
they acquired their injuries?

19:55.594 --> 19:58.429
Dr. Mcdonaugh:
<i> I started stopping some</i>
<i> of them in the hallways</i>

19:58.498 --> 20:00.031
<i> And outside just to chat,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:02.333
When sister mary grace
wasn't around.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.836
<i> That's when some of them</i>
<i> were brave enough to tell me</i>

20:05.872 --> 20:08.505
That sister mary grace
goaded them into fighting.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.374
Objection. Hearsay.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.842
Judge russo:
<i> Sustained.</i>

20:15.381 --> 20:16.913
Dr. Mcdonaugh,

20:17.984 --> 20:19.783
Can you identify this child?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.021
I...

20:28.228 --> 20:29.693
That's you.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.764
Doug:
<i> Thank you, your honour.</i>

20:33.800 --> 20:35.766
I have no further
questions for the witness.

<i> Dr. Mcdonaugh.</i>

20:38.938 --> 20:40.404
[clears throat]

20:41.941 --> 20:43.807
How may years did
you treat children

20:43.843 --> 20:45.343
At the pine river day school?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.278
Uh, for 43 years.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.880
And yet during
all those years,

20:49.949 --> 20:52.683
Despite your alleged
concern for these children,

20:52.818 --> 20:54.618
You never spoke to
anyone about it?

20:54.620 --> 20:58.555
I reported my observations to
my supervisor at the time-

20:58.557 --> 21:00.725
But you never made an
official complaint.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.762
[light dramatic music]

21:04.764 --> 21:06.229
No.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.432
I see.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.168
Dubois:
<i> Dr. Mcdonaugh,</i>

21:11.304 --> 21:13.337
If the children under
your medical care

21:13.472 --> 21:16.306
<i> Were really suffering,</i>

21:16.342 --> 21:18.609
Why didn't you
try to help them?

21:18.611 --> 21:20.511
<i> Why didn't you do anything?</i>

21:20.580 --> 21:23.180
Why aren't you
sitting right there

21:23.182 --> 21:25.783
<i> Next to my client</i>
<i> facing charges?</i>

21:25.852 --> 21:27.451
You're right.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.721
I should've done something.
I...

21:33.592 --> 21:35.125
I am responsible.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.263
I'm so sorry.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.534
<i> I should've tried harder.</i>

[sombre music]

21:53.346 --> 21:54.745
Andrea:
<i> Hey.</i>

21:54.747 --> 21:58.215
Relax, it's not like I'm
gonna throw you overboard.

21:58.284 --> 21:59.850
How can you even
joke about that?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.118
Aw shit.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.787
Sorry.

22:02.789 --> 22:03.920
<i> You're right.</i>

22:03.956 --> 22:06.156
<i> But hey, you said some</i>
<i> pretty crazy stuff,</i>

22:06.225 --> 22:08.959
Like accusing my brother
of getting people killed.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.027
Yeah, your brother's a
liar and I have proof.

22:11.064 --> 22:12.163
What kind of proof?

22:12.165 --> 22:13.430
<i> I saw the pathology report.</i>

22:13.566 --> 22:15.733
Contradicts everything brian
said about what happened

22:15.735 --> 22:16.767
To your worker on that boat.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.402
Not my worker.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.738
I don't work for the
family business.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.272
By choice.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.776
Still a clawford.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.644
Don't do that.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.781
Don't make assumptions about
me based on my last name.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.353
What are you
doing right now?

22:36.389 --> 22:37.621
Let's go for dinner.

22:37.623 --> 22:38.989
Why would I do that?

22:39.125 --> 22:41.959
So you can see how fun
and not evil I am.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.794
I'm pursuing a case
against your family.

22:43.929 --> 22:46.597
No shop talk. Promise.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.733
In fact, I never talk shop due
to my strict personal code.

22:49.736 --> 22:50.801
Which is?

22:50.936 --> 22:52.336
Not to be boring.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.338
So. Dinner?

22:56.509 --> 22:58.108

23:01.714 --> 23:09.353
[tense music]

23:09.355 --> 23:11.555
Well, they were, um,

23:11.557 --> 23:13.824
They were kinda run like,
uh, elementary schools.

23:13.959 --> 23:18.696
So from primary
to grade six.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.364
Were you ever
physically struck?

23:21.934 --> 23:23.634
Yes.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.436
Doug:
<i> Were you ever sexually</i>
<i> assaulted at school?</i>

23:25.571 --> 23:26.503
Preposterous!

23:26.539 --> 23:27.538
Mr. Dubois.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.539
Yeah, I'm sorry.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.608

When did the hitting start?

23:38.918 --> 23:42.920
[tense music]

23:42.989 --> 23:44.522

24:05.945 --> 24:07.144
<i> For my client.</i>

24:07.146 --> 24:09.146
I'd like to request a
recess until tomorrow.

<i> It's okay.</i>

24:16.322 --> 24:17.822
<i> Take your time.</i>

24:41.047 --> 24:43.647
Are you from the
insurance company?

24:43.782 --> 24:46.816
No, um, I'm actually
here for something else.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.354
You're avery mueller.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.258
I guess you should come in.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.062
<i> She filled out that</i>
<i> form before she died.</i>

24:59.064 --> 25:00.898
She didn't wanna be
contacted by you.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.766
But she didn't mail it in.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.436
She was really sick
the last few months.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.237
Not like it matters
now though.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.074
[avery sighs]

25:10.843 --> 25:12.276
So you're my half sister.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.811
Technically, I guess so.

25:16.081 --> 25:17.614
Avery:
<i> And you really didn't</i>
<i> know about me?</i>

25:17.650 --> 25:19.215
Kelly:
<i> She never mentioned you.</i>

25:21.353 --> 25:22.819
I was pretty shocked.

25:23.990 --> 25:27.524
Did she say anything about
who my birth father was?

25:27.593 --> 25:30.094
That's not something she
would talk about with me.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.531
It's one of the things
I wanted to ask her.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.867
<i> You have a photo of her?</i>

25:46.445 --> 25:51.615
[melancholy music]

25:51.651 --> 25:55.185
Avery:
<i> It's kinda hard to see</i>
<i> what she really looks like.</i>

25:55.221 --> 25:58.022
Sorry but I have a
lot to deal with here.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.590
<i> I'm waiting for someone from</i>

25:59.659 --> 26:02.192

Of course.

But we are not gonna
talk about that.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.182
Why not?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.352
Because it's really boring.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.688
So, why do you do it?

26:31.824 --> 26:33.557
I make good money.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.159
I make people happy.

26:38.497 --> 26:39.796
Truth?

26:39.832 --> 26:41.231
Of course.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.967
I don't like confrontation.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.637
Like, I could never
do what brian does.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.139
Be a corrupt,
ruthless businessman?

26:51.577 --> 26:53.510
Brian's a nice guy.

Right, sure.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.915
Why do you do what you do?

26:58.951 --> 27:01.318
Oh, I think I'm still
trying to figure that out.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.521
But I'm actually really
excited about this case

27:04.590 --> 27:06.156
I'm currently working on.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.827
But we agreed not
to talk about work.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.197
So let's get more wine.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.938
Ooh, smells good.

Bit overdone, what,

Let's talk.

It's about you, marcie.

27:59.778 --> 28:01.245
Right?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.814
It's always about you,
isn't it?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.782
Wait, what are you
talking about right now?

28:07.720 --> 28:10.120
Marcie, I'm-I'm there for
you every step of the way.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.059
I even risked my
own career for you.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.062
Hell, you didn't even
have enough grace

28:18.197 --> 28:19.530
To offer me a job.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.899
So you...You wanna
work for me?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.567
Is that where this is coming
from because I don't know--

28:23.636 --> 28:25.168
Oh my gosh.

28:26.405 --> 28:31.007
Marcie, you tell me that
rolanda was already suicidal

28:31.043 --> 28:33.744
Before she walked into
m&m like it was nothing!

28:33.813 --> 28:35.812
Okay, avery,
please don't go there.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.080
How you gonna tell me
not to go there, marcie?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.015
Marcie:
<i> Please don't go there.</i>

28:38.150 --> 28:39.683
It wasn't nothing to me!

28:41.887 --> 28:43.987
Marcie, you didn't for once
think about how that information

28:43.989 --> 28:45.522
Affected me!

28:46.291 --> 28:47.624
Much less even apologize!

28:47.693 --> 28:48.658
Apologize?

28:48.694 --> 28:50.960
<i> Yes, apologize!</i>
-Wow, oh my gosh!

28:50.996 --> 28:52.028
Really?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.863
Marcie, everybody blamed me.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.166
You blamed me,

28:56.202 --> 28:58.068
Your father blamed me.

28:58.203 --> 29:01.238
<i> It changed my life.</i>

29:01.240 --> 29:03.506
And you wanna walk in here
like "I'm unburdened now,

"I'm better now?"

29:06.312 --> 29:08.312
So what about me, marcie?

Marcie:

29:13.886 --> 29:15.418
Marcie, I'm sick of this.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.424
You never fought for this.

Marcie, everything
is about you.

29:30.703 --> 29:33.203

When I started school here she

Eventually she dealt with it.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.563
I told him you were
one of my star lawyers

36:39.698 --> 36:41.231

36:44.035 --> 36:45.235
Thanks.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.303
The barristers' society,

36:46.305 --> 36:48.171
They have to justify
their existence, right?

You're friends with

file at that time?

41:37.629 --> 41:38.728
Marcie:
<i> What do you have?</i>

41:38.797 --> 41:40.930
Ellery:
<i> Basil allen's</i>
<i> pathology report.</i>

41:40.966 --> 41:43.466
Zero alcohol levels
and signs of trauma

41:43.468 --> 41:45.268
Indicating signs
of a struggle.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.604
<i> No water in his lungs</i>
<i> so he didn't drown.</i>

41:47.606 --> 41:49.739
He died on that boat and
was thrown overboard.

41:49.874 --> 41:52.108
So, we have the clawfords?

41:52.243 --> 41:54.610
Ellery:
<i> No, we have their fall guy.</i>

41:55.847 --> 41:59.081
<i> Michael mccleod, 43, of</i>
<i> st. John's, newfoundland,</i>

41:59.117 --> 42:00.617
With a history of
summary offences

42:00.752 --> 42:02.985
Around drinking and fighting.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.320
<i> He turned himself in.</i>

42:04.455 --> 42:07.323
<i> Admitted to assaulting basil</i>
<i> and knocking him overboard.</i>

42:11.229 --> 42:12.762
These people...

42:14.099 --> 42:15.365
They kill basil allen's
little brother and then they,

42:15.500 --> 42:17.266
They had their
lackey kill him?

42:19.037 --> 42:21.170
I'm not letting them
get away with this.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.505
[hand knocking]

42:22.507 --> 42:24.173
Marcie?
-Yes?

42:24.175 --> 42:25.575
Thank you.

<i> It's from</i>
<i> vivian jefferson's lawyers.</i>

42:36.688 --> 42:37.920
She's giving me thirty days

42:37.923 --> 42:40.089
To pay back the eight million
that she invested or...

42:42.060 --> 42:44.593
She's selling off her
interest in the firm.

42:44.629 --> 42:46.095
What?

42:46.898 --> 42:48.264
[doug sighs]

42:48.399 --> 42:51.467
[light dramatic music]

42:51.536 --> 42:53.269
I, I need a minute.

42:54.072 --> 43:01.076
[light dramatic music]

43:01.112 --> 43:07.750
â™ª

43:07.885 --> 43:09.318
[phone buzzing]

43:10.889 --> 43:12.354
What's up?

43:12.356 --> 43:13.823
I need to see you.
