01:17.422 --> 01:19.747
Forget the lack of airs and graces.

01:21.486 --> 01:22.917
It's been a long day.

01:24.179 --> 01:26.591
I left Portugal at 4.30 this morning.

01:26.618 --> 01:28.507
It's the alcohol that's keeping me going.

01:28.627 --> 01:29.874
And where about in Portugal?

01:29.994 --> 01:30.936
Loriga.

01:30.963 --> 01:33.543
It's a little village in the mountains.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.128
It's really hot in the summer.

01:35.677 --> 01:37.400
Ski country in the winter, I'd...

01:37.453 --> 01:39.219
live there and bake bread, if I could.

01:39.646 --> 01:40.680
I'll stick to beer.

01:42.130 --> 01:44.069
A Frenchman who doesn't drink wine?

01:45.350 --> 01:47.162
I drink wine just not tonight.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.978
Are your kids bilingual?

01:49.170 --> 01:49.805
No.

01:50.136 --> 01:51.893
No, they probably should be, but,

01:52.013 --> 01:53.455
when they were growing up, we didn't

01:53.650 --> 01:55.880
speak much French in the house.

01:56.769 --> 01:57.873
I always thought

01:57.993 --> 01:59.349
if I ever had kids,

01:59.826 --> 02:02.328
it'd be really nice for
them to have two languages:

02:02.409 --> 02:05.552
you know, mom's language,
and dad's language.

02:05.672 --> 02:08.463
Little cultural citizens of the world.

02:09.112 --> 02:10.829
But then I hooked up with Nelson, and...

02:12.023 --> 02:13.359
well, he's barely got any English.

02:15.679 --> 02:18.077
Sonny married beneath herself.

02:19.243 --> 02:20.174
Where are you from?

02:21.232 --> 02:22.222
Not London.

02:23.939 --> 02:24.747
Corby.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.026
Old steel town in the
middle of the country.

02:28.553 --> 02:29.652
I'm a mick-mack.

02:29.870 --> 02:30.960
I don't know what that is.

02:30.992 --> 02:33.299
Half-Irish, half-Scottish.
Second generation.

02:33.331 --> 02:35.736
They all followed the heavy
industry to England, and stayed.

02:35.928 --> 02:37.213
It can be a difficult mix.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.893
The Celt and the steel,

02:38.947 --> 02:40.237
and the displacement...

02:41.218 --> 02:42.657
hard to penetrate really.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.631
Do you go back?

02:47.680 --> 02:51.476
My brother and I, we were...
put into care, as kids.

02:51.604 --> 02:52.864
I didn't see him or years,

02:52.880 --> 02:55.584
but I eventually shipped down
here when I was in my teens.

02:55.636 --> 02:58.481
But Corby, I was born there,
I wouldn't call it home.

02:58.481 --> 03:00.839
- Care can mess kids up.
- Yeah it can.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.808
My brother and I spent some years in care.

03:04.308 --> 03:05.052
What?

03:08.038 --> 03:09.372
What shall we toast?

03:10.087 --> 03:11.387
How about...

03:12.988 --> 03:14.447
absent friends.

03:19.919 --> 03:22.740
36 HOURS EARLIER

03:35.859 --> 03:37.289
You need a piss?

03:43.726 --> 03:45.185
Really, you're making me nervous.

03:45.906 --> 03:46.940
I can't sleep.

03:47.774 --> 03:49.966
When I do, eventually, I just see his face

03:50.086 --> 03:51.402
right there, all the time.

03:52.168 --> 03:54.177
- Who are you talking about?
- Victor!

03:54.773 --> 03:57.200
I just keep on hearing his
phone call over and over.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.815
He was probably wasted.

03:59.678 --> 04:01.449
The guy can't hold his liquor, you know.

04:01.846 --> 04:05.280
Yeah, he's a friendly type
of murdering necrophiliac.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.470
- What are we gonna do?
- Lay low.

04:10.122 --> 04:11.734
I'm not sure we're good at that.

04:33.286 --> 04:34.313
Yeah.

04:39.098 --> 04:40.103
What are you doing?

04:40.126 --> 04:42.391
- I work here.
- Well, it's 6.30!

04:42.754 --> 04:43.464
Yeah.

04:43.719 --> 04:45.080
That's the time I start work.

04:45.138 --> 04:45.904
Really?

04:48.317 --> 04:49.912
Possible new contract.

04:51.183 --> 04:53.193
Didn't want to tie up one of the vans.

04:54.056 --> 04:56.241
- Did you get a haircut?
- No.

05:05.947 --> 05:08.411
- The city that never sleeps.
- That's New York.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.970
- What's London?
- London is The Big Smoke.

05:13.038 --> 05:16.774
- So, what's Paris?
- An overpriced shithole near Disneyland.

05:17.488 --> 05:19.054
Look at you making a joke.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.252
You're evolving.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.908
Hello, we're looking for Nelson Clay.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.023
What's wrong with you?

05:28.466 --> 05:29.573
Battle wound.

05:29.602 --> 05:31.083
You're such a loser.

05:31.344 --> 05:32.796
I never lose.

05:35.026 --> 05:37.019
Can you put the pens away, please?

05:38.898 --> 05:40.056
Knife wound.

05:40.238 --> 05:42.435
- It needs stitches.
- It needs a wash.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.997
She's right. No knife wounds before school.

05:45.026 --> 05:46.325
I'm practising,

05:46.393 --> 05:48.528
in case the French guys show up.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.978
There are no French guys, darling.

05:56.144 --> 05:57.104
Come on.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.432
Where are we going?

06:08.540 --> 06:10.729
You don't have to be such
a dick, man. It's very rude.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.068
I'm not in the mood to chat, lads.

06:13.821 --> 06:15.190
So if you don't mind...

06:36.701 --> 06:37.922
Taste this.

06:45.679 --> 06:46.950
What are you getting?

06:49.371 --> 06:50.571
Ah, um...

06:52.040 --> 06:53.810
- Tangy. -
It's rose-hip.

06:54.171 --> 06:56.974
There's your daily dose of
vitamin C in that one cup.

06:57.568 --> 06:59.646
See, I'm growing these old school

06:59.708 --> 07:01.246
traditional shrubs.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.277
The new ones are bred, so they don't fruit.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.543
People want everything sterile these days.

07:06.809 --> 07:08.445
Are we here for a tea party?

07:09.331 --> 07:10.551
I need your help.

07:11.011 --> 07:12.211
Inside.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.401
What are you reading?

07:16.204 --> 07:18.464
Don't try to be my friend. It won't work.

07:29.589 --> 07:30.789
He's been shot?

07:31.342 --> 07:32.545
Right knee.

07:34.683 --> 07:37.516
Well, I can't fucking do
this. This is way beyond me.

07:37.941 --> 07:40.513
You need to get him to a
hospital, he needs a doctor.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.045
We're not here for that.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.368
You're going to kill him?

07:55.338 --> 07:56.538
Yeah.

07:57.212 --> 07:58.892
This is my death scene, mate.

07:59.876 --> 08:01.213
Joey will kill him.

08:02.161 --> 08:03.365
You will clean it up.

08:03.739 --> 08:05.618
It's just his leg. You can save him.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.439
- You don't understand the bigger picture?
- What? And you do?

08:14.951 --> 08:16.151
Boss.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.734
Denny, put your weapon away. Get some air.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.708
I'll let Frank fill you in himself.

08:25.496 --> 08:27.398
Don't leave anything out now.

08:30.214 --> 08:31.440
Fuck!

08:37.155 --> 08:38.356
What did you do?

08:43.073 --> 08:44.274
Got caught.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.862
I don't suppose you carry
any painkillers, do you?

08:49.038 --> 08:50.238
No, sorry.

08:52.513 --> 08:53.713
Ha!

08:53.715 --> 08:55.117
Last one.

09:02.189 --> 09:04.392
Was this the way out you talked about?

09:05.322 --> 09:06.522
Yeah.

09:07.582 --> 09:08.791
I, um...

09:09.740 --> 09:12.778
I was involved with a
man named Veysel Kisa.

09:12.993 --> 09:15.195
- He's the real deal.
- Turkish.

09:16.506 --> 09:18.468
- They were in Saint-Nazaire.-
They're everywhere.

09:18.638 --> 09:20.489
I sold Veysel some information.

09:21.569 --> 09:22.769
It was good money.

09:23.543 --> 09:24.743
Enough for this?

09:26.273 --> 09:27.473
Maybe not.

09:32.676 --> 09:33.930
Gotta go into London.

09:37.904 --> 09:39.379
Let's finish this thing up.

09:43.610 --> 09:46.010
- He's not really going to kill you.
- Yeah,

09:46.321 --> 09:47.521
he will.

09:48.473 --> 09:49.835
And he'll kill you too.

09:51.027 --> 09:52.230
When it suits him.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.107
Not today, but you know...

09:54.227 --> 09:56.012
Try not to overthink it... it's...

09:56.088 --> 09:57.456
it's just a fact.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.615
Who's been smoking? Huh?

10:04.064 --> 10:06.016
Sonny's got a nose like a beagle!

10:09.769 --> 10:11.599
Let's not make this any more painful.

10:11.673 --> 10:13.800
- You don't have to do this.
- You know I do!

10:13.920 --> 10:16.271
- Bullshit.
- Just to be clear,

10:17.066 --> 10:19.590
this is business, all right?

10:20.024 --> 10:22.873
It's not personal. There is no alternative.

10:23.787 --> 10:25.671
He knew exactly the risk he was taking

10:25.694 --> 10:28.345
when he went squealing
to those fucking Turks!

10:32.850 --> 10:34.059
You're finished.

10:35.781 --> 10:37.825
This isn't part of the agreement.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.374
I said no.

11:01.002 --> 11:02.202
I'm sorry.

11:25.174 --> 11:27.558
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
leave you to get on with it.

11:28.352 --> 11:31.360
I have some business in town. Joey will
drive you back when you're finished.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.023
Fuck you! I'm not cleaning this!

11:34.307 --> 11:36.160
Joey can drive us back right now.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.530
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

11:39.245 --> 11:40.886
Your partner agrees with you?

11:41.365 --> 11:42.565
Always.

11:46.551 --> 11:47.891
It's been a tough morning.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.577
I'll assume you're emotional.

11:49.591 --> 11:51.553
I'm not an emotional man.

11:52.806 --> 11:55.605
We're not cleaning up the
murder you just committed.

11:56.888 --> 11:58.652
And that's your decision?

11:59.884 --> 12:02.154
This place will remain exactly as it is

12:02.155 --> 12:03.898
until these two change their minds.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.248
Sonny comes back tomorrow,

12:06.368 --> 12:08.224
this place isn't as was,

12:08.344 --> 12:10.153
there will be consequences.

12:13.746 --> 12:15.160
Joey, get the car.

12:30.287 --> 12:32.705
Every rule I insisted on, he breaks:

12:32.740 --> 12:33.960
we're not there for crime,

12:33.977 --> 12:36.395
we don't know details of
what shit has gone down,

12:36.445 --> 12:39.544
we control the scene. And... and
now he's killing guys in front of us?

12:39.731 --> 12:41.310
His own fucking guy.

12:43.007 --> 12:44.657
You don't have anything to say about this?

12:44.964 --> 12:47.309
Yeah. I have something
I want to contribute.

12:47.689 --> 12:49.449
If you say no to Nelson Clay,

12:50.283 --> 12:51.895
we're gonna need new friends.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.227
Well, even for you that
would be very stupid.

12:55.693 --> 12:57.918
I told you not to say
that anymore, all right?

12:58.668 --> 12:59.868
All right?

13:00.046 --> 13:02.305
You're willing to put your family
at risk because your pride is hurt?

13:02.329 --> 13:04.230
It has nothing to do with my pride!

13:04.452 --> 13:07.296
You got a pretty fucking big hide.
You know that? Do you know that?

13:07.319 --> 13:09.895
- Huh?
- We gotta make it stop now,

13:10.116 --> 13:12.640
or we're fucked! Permanently.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.670
He will cut Oliver's balls
before they grow peach fuzz.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.573
and he will let Maddy
live, but he will ruin her!

13:17.574 --> 13:19.327
How are you fucking helping right now?!

13:19.422 --> 13:20.692
How do you ever help?

13:20.721 --> 13:22.520
You go back, you do the job,

13:22.565 --> 13:24.550
- and you buy us time.
- No.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.447
I should rip your fucking

13:26.448 --> 13:28.872
- head off right now.
- Well, anything you wanna try.

13:29.148 --> 13:30.470
Go for it.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.745
You okay?

14:03.091 --> 14:04.963
I dropped 'em off in town.

14:10.613 --> 14:12.688
So what happens if he doesn't do the clean?

14:12.963 --> 14:14.275
He will.

14:14.666 --> 14:16.160
He's just...

14:18.701 --> 14:20.230
overwhelmed.

14:22.890 --> 14:25.051
Denny, go inside, check them out.

14:30.985 --> 14:32.635
Jean Bastière

14:32.643 --> 14:35.526
needs to feel like he has some control.

14:38.506 --> 14:39.721
But he doesn't.

14:39.765 --> 14:41.734
He can always say no.

14:42.072 --> 14:43.880
It's a powerful word.

14:45.353 --> 14:46.799
And then what?

14:49.416 --> 14:50.906
Stay here.

14:53.239 --> 14:54.880
Clear your head.

15:01.753 --> 15:04.919
My husband suffered some
depression. Long-term unemployed.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.323
Doctors got him on this dairy-free diet.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.355
Trouble is, everything tastes like rubber.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.304
Well, it could help I suppose.

15:11.315 --> 15:14.585
Our bodies aren't designed to cope with
all the processed rubbish on the shelves.

15:14.585 --> 15:17.667
True. We try to stay clear of processed.

15:18.731 --> 15:20.659
- Except crisps.
- Hm!

15:20.681 --> 15:22.582
Couldn't live without crisps.

15:23.615 --> 15:25.193
Jean, this is... um...

15:25.313 --> 15:27.770
- DCI Squire.
- Diane Squire.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.547
I hope you don't mind me popping by.

15:29.623 --> 15:30.823
No.

15:31.216 --> 15:32.520
Could we have a quick word?

15:33.463 --> 15:36.187
Of course. Um... could
you just give me 5 minutes?

15:36.187 --> 15:37.387
Sure.

16:03.451 --> 16:04.677
Thank you.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.316
Could we have the room please?

16:08.377 --> 16:10.103
He means "get out".

16:12.685 --> 16:15.540
- Thank you.
- I'll go see a man about a horse.

16:18.390 --> 16:20.360
- Can I offer you a drink?
- No, thanks.

16:20.405 --> 16:22.176
- Mind if I have one?
- Not at all.

16:30.987 --> 16:32.548
Thanks for seeing me.

16:32.699 --> 16:33.899
Uh...

16:34.500 --> 16:36.788
I'm taking over the Met investigation

16:36.788 --> 16:39.476
into the activities of DCI Tom Kendrick.

16:40.719 --> 16:42.632
I know you had dealings with him.

16:43.276 --> 16:44.525
Many people did.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.070
He was head of procurement.

16:46.886 --> 16:48.561
He put a lot of work your way.

16:50.025 --> 16:52.301
He put work everyone's way.

16:52.421 --> 16:55.337
You paid Tom Kendrick back-handers.

16:55.972 --> 16:57.874
I can demonstrate that very clearly.

16:58.861 --> 17:01.285
You weren't alone. Everyone paid him.

17:01.302 --> 17:02.692
I'm not interested in that.

17:04.916 --> 17:08.354
I believe Tom Kendrick was involved
with some serious criminals.

17:08.886 --> 17:12.303
People powerful enough to kill a
police officer and feel protected.

17:13.319 --> 17:14.590
Kendrick was murdered?

17:15.011 --> 17:16.646
You were there, you tell me.

17:19.012 --> 17:22.039
- You did clean the scene.
- Yes, um...

17:22.282 --> 17:24.269
but I understood it was suicide.

17:26.550 --> 17:29.832
The death of a fellow officer
seems to put everyone on edge.

17:30.275 --> 17:32.772
It's early days, but anything you know,

17:32.818 --> 17:35.360
scenes you cleaned,
paperwork you might have,

17:35.377 --> 17:38.005
photographs, logbooks, diaries...

17:38.465 --> 17:40.208
anything you think could help.

17:43.361 --> 17:44.573
Keep in touch.

17:45.845 --> 17:47.496
I'll see myself out.

17:49.290 --> 17:50.490
Thank you.

17:57.931 --> 17:59.353
_

18:08.921 --> 18:11.277
_

18:52.653 --> 18:53.853
Thanks.

18:57.578 --> 18:59.899
- I'm looking for someone.
- Who?

19:01.801 --> 19:03.101
Veysel Kisa.

19:06.564 --> 19:07.881
Are you a friend?

19:08.732 --> 19:11.190
I'm a friend of a friend.
I need to talk to him.

19:15.130 --> 19:17.207
Tell him Frank McElroy is dead.

19:22.048 --> 19:23.411
I know a Veysel.

19:23.921 --> 19:25.590
It might be the same one.

19:26.346 --> 19:28.446
He's kind of difficult to get hold of.

19:32.397 --> 19:33.628
But I can try.

19:35.734 --> 19:37.573
I don't usually take the time

19:37.908 --> 19:39.753
for meet and greets.

19:40.928 --> 19:42.494
But you have my attention.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.406
We've lost £100 000
worth of A-grade heroin.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.600
- That was clumsy.
- We think you have it.

19:49.743 --> 19:50.943
I don't.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.334
We need payment, or our product back.

19:54.351 --> 19:57.360
This is the last time I will repeat myself,

19:57.400 --> 19:59.330
and I do it out of politeness

19:59.341 --> 20:01.805
because you are tourists in my city.

20:02.470 --> 20:03.906
I don't have any heroin.

20:04.128 --> 20:06.132
A-grade or otherwise.

20:06.398 --> 20:07.624
We were told you did.

20:07.675 --> 20:09.655
- You were misinformed.
- Lying fuck!

20:09.656 --> 20:10.840
No, no, no!

20:10.842 --> 20:12.403
Martin Bastière is the lying fuck!

20:12.471 --> 20:15.446
A guy called Martin Bastière
told us that you took it from him.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.057
And it wasn't hard to find you, so,

20:17.177 --> 20:20.520
- we figured that you must be a player.
- You know Martin Bastière.

20:21.059 --> 20:23.136
I don't know any French man.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.371
Do we know any French man, Denny ?

20:25.372 --> 20:27.155
I know a couple Spanish,

20:27.411 --> 20:28.611
a Swede,

20:29.504 --> 20:31.991
no French though. Seen 'em on telly.

20:33.527 --> 20:35.026
No French.

20:38.157 --> 20:39.966
Sounds to me,

20:40.684 --> 20:44.605
like you all need to keep
a closer eye on your heroin.

20:45.243 --> 20:48.134
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Yes.

20:48.533 --> 20:49.970
Yes, I do.

20:50.865 --> 20:53.428
That is exactly what I think.

20:53.455 --> 20:55.273
Don't talk anymore.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.978
Get on your feet,

20:58.098 --> 21:00.612
- and leave.
- Okay, we go.

21:01.099 --> 21:02.680
Thank you for your time.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.902
Hello?

21:17.428 --> 21:18.811
Hello, who's this?

21:21.357 --> 21:23.645
- Maddy?
- So, you didn't drown.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.480
No, I didn't. But my shoulder hurts
if it makes you feel any better.

21:31.822 --> 21:34.776
- I should have cut your throat!
- Maybe.

21:36.505 --> 21:37.705
But you didn't.

21:37.950 --> 21:40.040
Nelson Clay doesn't have my heroin.

21:40.088 --> 21:43.121
- You've met him?
- No, we tweeted him, you lying prick!

21:43.160 --> 21:45.001
Oh, there you are, you shit for brains.

21:45.121 --> 21:47.387
Romain took off your kit mask, did he, uh?

21:49.205 --> 21:52.200
- I gotta go now, miss you already.
- We will find you!

21:52.232 --> 21:53.598
Ciao!

21:55.275 --> 21:56.747
Son of a bitch!

22:00.313 --> 22:03.045
Excuse me, do you have this in my size?

22:05.253 --> 22:07.270
I have already had

22:07.390 --> 22:10.200
127 hits.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.128
- Well, then your life is now worthwhile.
- Hm.

22:13.146 --> 22:17.350
It's mostly just... samples and
drawings, a few images of pieces I admire,

22:17.367 --> 22:19.600
some of Maddy's photos.

22:19.647 --> 22:23.718
Bastieredesign.com is
alive and kicking. Hm!

22:26.081 --> 22:27.301
You all right?

22:29.256 --> 22:31.568
No. Eh... ah...

22:32.295 --> 22:36.180
I think I may have made
a bit of an ass of myself.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.400
Right...

22:38.557 --> 22:40.357
- He proposed.
- Philip?

22:40.358 --> 22:43.461
Mm... now, I mean he's very nice, but...

22:44.517 --> 22:46.440
I've been married twice already.

22:46.454 --> 22:47.852
If I'm ever going to do it again,

22:47.880 --> 22:51.080
he is going to have to rock my world.

22:54.124 --> 22:57.147
How did you know? You
know, that Jean was...

22:57.455 --> 22:58.664
the one.

23:00.011 --> 23:03.029
You know, just never really
thought about it, he just...

23:03.161 --> 23:04.384
was.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.280
Did I really just use the phrase "the one"?

23:08.308 --> 23:10.960
Yeah, you did. You know, that
makes you officially lonely.

23:10.983 --> 23:12.724
Right, now listen I'm
going to pop by tomorrow.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.939
Okay, not too early. It's
Maddy's first day at school.

23:15.957 --> 23:17.271
Oh, Jesus!

23:17.345 --> 23:19.911
I would rather gnaw my own
nipple off than go back to school

23:19.928 --> 23:20.931
Really?

23:21.234 --> 23:22.897
Oh, I'd get back in a heartbeat.

23:22.898 --> 23:24.600
- Freak.
- Hm.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.283
Hey.

23:47.265 --> 23:48.640
Everything okay?

23:49.394 --> 23:50.653
I can help.

23:50.857 --> 23:52.063
What?

23:55.097 --> 23:57.850
Everything's fine. It's
good. Don't worry about it.

23:57.851 --> 23:59.060
I can help.

24:00.066 --> 24:02.318
- I don't even know what you...
- Our petty cash flow

24:02.318 --> 24:06.172
averages £500 to £700 across
an average week, give or take.

24:07.188 --> 24:09.799
Less lately, 'cause things
have been a bit tight.

24:12.070 --> 24:13.506
If I open the safe now,

24:13.520 --> 24:17.037
I'd find close to £56,000 in used notes,

24:17.065 --> 24:19.369
bound and stacked in neat little piles.

24:19.387 --> 24:22.208
That's 30,000 more than
was in there last week.

24:26.465 --> 24:30.132
Detective Chief Inspector Squire
seems like a very serious woman.

24:30.359 --> 24:31.643
I think she is.

24:35.633 --> 24:38.812
- Promise me you're not hurting anyone.
- I'm not hurting anyone.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.140
Are you in danger?

24:47.697 --> 24:50.537
My father has dementia,
he's in a nursing home.

24:51.391 --> 24:53.333
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

24:53.565 --> 24:57.216
He's an horrible man. Being such a cunt's
the only thing that's keeping him going.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.950
- Okay.
- I do the books for them, gratis.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.414
It takes the edge off the fees which

25:02.431 --> 25:04.912
are a disgrace for the
level of care they offer.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.331
I have access to the records

25:10.332 --> 25:14.011
of all of the nursing homes in
the group, going back 8 years.

25:15.208 --> 25:17.480
I can create false invoices

25:17.518 --> 25:20.618
for cleaning jobs on deaths
that have actually happened.

25:26.038 --> 25:28.417
- You mean, launder the money?
- We'd run

25:28.466 --> 25:29.670
two diaries.

25:29.688 --> 25:31.192
Make sure that very job

25:31.331 --> 25:33.673
was detailed, accounted for.

25:35.104 --> 25:38.680
The second diary would be
for the off-the-record jobs.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.955
Why would you do that?

25:44.283 --> 25:45.900
Because I love my job.

25:48.188 --> 25:51.242
And I was here from the start,
and I don't want to lose it

25:52.145 --> 25:54.853
because of temporary difficulties.

26:00.900 --> 26:02.319
You'd be exposed.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.521
I'm already exposed.

26:08.954 --> 26:10.190
I can help.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.054
You're always sad.

26:32.822 --> 26:34.529
- No, I'm not.
- You are. Like everything's

26:34.530 --> 26:35.873
tragic all the time.

26:36.688 --> 26:38.562
I seem like a tragic guy to you?

26:39.822 --> 26:41.944
I got you, Ollie, Mom,

26:42.171 --> 26:43.573
I'm the luckiest guy I know.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.974
If you're going to lie, at
least put some efforts into it.

26:46.008 --> 26:47.398
That was rubbish.

26:51.684 --> 26:52.962
Do you wanna share?

26:54.610 --> 26:57.560
Kids sharing an adult problem
isn't always a good idea.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.431
So you do have problems.

27:00.310 --> 27:02.480
- What are you, a cop?
- I'd be a great cop.

27:02.552 --> 27:04.255
You'd be a great anything.

27:07.002 --> 27:08.202
Beat it.

27:16.442 --> 27:17.643
You're drunk.

27:18.537 --> 27:21.350
I've been trying really hard, but no.

27:22.352 --> 27:23.715
Have you changed your mind?

27:23.716 --> 27:24.916
No.

27:30.894 --> 27:32.450
- Can we talk?
- No.

27:34.084 --> 27:35.298
I found someone.

27:35.325 --> 27:38.518
I don't care. I don't want
you to interfere. Stay away.

27:38.979 --> 27:40.851
You don't even factor in my thinking.

27:40.971 --> 27:42.544
Yeah, you said that already.

27:44.122 --> 27:46.733
- Right before you called me for help.
- You're pissing me off!

27:46.750 --> 27:48.856
Yeah, I piss everybody
off, that's my thing.

28:09.211 --> 28:10.411
Mom?

28:11.251 --> 28:12.451
Mom?

28:43.698 --> 28:44.898
Ah!

28:45.794 --> 28:46.994
Ah!

29:10.369 --> 29:12.628
Urgh! Urgh!

29:12.676 --> 29:13.876
- Urgh!
- Ah!

29:13.901 --> 29:15.819
- Urgh! Urgh!
- Ah!

29:15.845 --> 29:17.481
Urgh! Urgh!

29:17.839 --> 29:21.062
- Urgh!
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

30:04.835 --> 30:06.862
I... I'm looking for Claire.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.470
She's asleep.

30:10.098 --> 30:11.500
Yeah, sorry.

30:12.868 --> 30:14.320
Are you the French man?

30:14.414 --> 30:15.614
Yeah.

30:17.376 --> 30:18.965
Claire!

30:20.100 --> 30:21.542
Take your shoes off.

30:23.427 --> 30:26.572
- What's going on?
- Booty call. You owe me.

30:28.235 --> 30:29.569
Sorry.

30:45.504 --> 30:47.320
I saw a man killed yesterday.

30:48.762 --> 30:49.962
They shot him.

30:50.634 --> 30:51.834
in the heart.

30:53.547 --> 30:54.921
Right in front of us.

30:58.911 --> 31:00.111
Us?

31:00.433 --> 31:01.636
My brother

31:02.527 --> 31:05.319
and some guys that work for this gangster.

31:07.976 --> 31:09.560
He wants me to clean it up,

31:11.251 --> 31:12.682
remove the body,

31:13.936 --> 31:15.565
get rid of the evidence.

31:18.677 --> 31:19.954
Can you do that?

31:22.483 --> 31:23.683
Yes.

31:26.345 --> 31:28.190
If I do, he owns me.

31:32.361 --> 31:34.092
Accessory to murder,

31:35.035 --> 31:36.908
along with everything else.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.937
This main guy he has a brother.

31:44.326 --> 31:47.005
Properly evil guy.

31:49.725 --> 31:51.791
And I made an enemy of him.

31:53.733 --> 31:55.901
- I'm sorry, I don't want to frighten you.
- No.

31:58.302 --> 31:59.502
I wanna know.

32:29.852 --> 32:31.052
Hello?

32:31.565 --> 32:32.765
Yes, speaking.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.020
Oh, God!

32:36.021 --> 32:37.627
Um, right.

32:38.144 --> 32:39.432
Yeah, no, I understand.

32:39.937 --> 32:41.498
Okay, I'll be there right away.

32:43.267 --> 32:44.779
Fuck!

32:50.579 --> 32:53.934
Oh, Jean, it's me! Where are you?

32:54.054 --> 32:57.198
Where are you all the bloody time?
Um, call me when you get this!

32:58.027 --> 32:59.227
Martin?

33:01.030 --> 33:02.755
- Sorry.
- Mornin'.

33:02.767 --> 33:04.060
Listen, a pipe's busted the studio.

33:04.061 --> 33:06.248
The ceiling's fallen in,
I've gotta get over there.

33:06.343 --> 33:07.930
Oh, it's terrible. You want me to go?

33:07.931 --> 33:09.414
No, it has to be me 'cause I'm the tenant.

33:09.414 --> 33:10.760
- But can you stay with Maddy?
- Sure.

33:10.768 --> 33:12.823
Okay, she's got her induction
at the school at 11 o'clock.

33:12.827 --> 33:14.712
I'll be back in time to take
her, but she needs to be ready.

33:14.947 --> 33:16.769
Okay. What about Oliver?

33:17.100 --> 33:18.532
Uh, no, I've already taken him.

33:19.047 --> 33:20.635
Listen, I owe you. Thank you.

33:41.155 --> 33:42.355
Maddy?

33:46.844 --> 33:48.045
Maddy?

33:51.978 --> 33:53.181
Maddy?

33:55.809 --> 33:57.010
Maddy?

33:59.316 --> 34:00.518
Maddy?

34:02.991 --> 34:04.687
- Maddy?
- No!

34:05.394 --> 34:06.602
Don't come in!

34:07.612 --> 34:08.818
Okay.

34:08.967 --> 34:10.268
Has Mom left already?

34:10.612 --> 34:12.675
Yeah, it's just you and me.
Are you ready for school?

34:12.715 --> 34:14.730
- No!
- Come on, it won't be that bad.

34:14.889 --> 34:16.280
When's Mom back?

34:16.518 --> 34:18.533
You do look something in
that uniform, you know?

34:18.560 --> 34:20.940
- Can you wait downstairs, please?
- Are you okay?

34:22.228 --> 34:24.857
I've... I've started my period.

34:26.705 --> 34:27.905
Oh.

34:30.850 --> 34:32.050
Um...

34:35.893 --> 34:37.648
You sure you got everything you need?

34:37.649 --> 34:38.849
I don't know.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.101
Um...

34:40.864 --> 34:42.428
Are you looking through your mom's stuff?

34:42.431 --> 34:44.475
I have. There's a lot of different things.

34:44.492 --> 34:47.199
- And anything that looks right?
- No!

34:50.003 --> 34:52.047
- You sure you don't want me to come in?
- No!

34:53.299 --> 34:54.498
Oh...

34:55.038 --> 34:57.767
What about the... the pad
thing with the little wings?

34:57.800 --> 34:59.232
What are you talking about?

34:59.646 --> 35:01.019
Oh my god.

35:05.691 --> 35:07.127
I'm gonna go to the shop.

35:07.922 --> 35:09.681
See what they have, and, um...

35:10.725 --> 35:12.763
I'll leave you a hot water bottle,

35:12.786 --> 35:14.415
- so you can rub...
- Okay!

35:16.998 --> 35:19.462
- Are you gonna be moody from now on?
- Shut up!

35:20.695 --> 35:21.904
Okay.

35:21.905 --> 35:23.230
Ah, I'll be right back.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.586
Oh, hey.

35:42.449 --> 35:43.657
What time is it?

35:44.139 --> 35:46.041
Late. I let you sleep.

35:47.301 --> 35:49.248
- How late?
- 9.30.

35:49.901 --> 35:51.101
Fuck.

35:57.270 --> 35:58.478
This is a one-off,

35:58.495 --> 35:59.954
you can't come here again.

36:01.601 --> 36:03.440
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're not invited.

36:03.457 --> 36:05.001
This is my space.

36:14.447 --> 36:15.658
Hello.

36:15.753 --> 36:16.958
Hey.

36:18.865 --> 36:20.065
What?

36:21.774 --> 36:23.153
I can't come now.

36:24.340 --> 36:25.673
D... don't worry.

36:25.921 --> 36:27.127
We'll fix it.

36:31.531 --> 36:32.819
Who's taking Maddy?

36:33.943 --> 36:35.149
Okay.

36:35.709 --> 36:36.975
I'm on my way back.

36:38.049 --> 36:39.479
I'll meet you there.

36:44.925 --> 36:46.233
That's why not.

36:46.591 --> 36:49.037
Don't take a phone call like
that in front of me again.

37:04.072 --> 37:06.149
I got you one of everything they had,

37:06.154 --> 37:08.590
just to stay on the safe side.

37:10.051 --> 37:11.251
And...

37:11.819 --> 37:13.521
I made you hot chocolate.

37:14.509 --> 37:16.416
Because in my experience,

37:17.620 --> 37:19.465
women love chocolate.

37:26.371 --> 37:27.622
Thank you.

37:41.850 --> 37:44.562
Okay, sign here, please.

37:47.456 --> 37:50.459
Thanks. I'll get my solicitor
to call you about repairs.

37:50.471 --> 37:51.811
You got your insurance details?

37:51.812 --> 37:54.347
Yeah, they're at my husband's office,
but I'll get them to you later.

37:54.348 --> 37:56.312
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

37:57.629 --> 37:58.878
Jesus!

37:59.081 --> 38:01.295
It is fucking carnage!

38:01.320 --> 38:02.703
Jean is nowhere to be seen,

38:02.720 --> 38:05.520
and I'm missing Maddy's
first day at Kings Gate.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.250
Kids are resilient.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.800
Maddy holds grudges.

38:08.832 --> 38:11.353
When I was her age, Dad took
me out for a drive to Suffolk.

38:11.354 --> 38:12.922
Kicked me out to the curb
with and apple and fiver,

38:12.933 --> 38:14.471
and told me to find my own way home.

38:15.067 --> 38:16.361
I didn't know that.

38:16.789 --> 38:18.210
Taught me independence.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.859
Look, kids are tough.

38:20.839 --> 38:22.342
Fucking Suffolk though.

38:22.937 --> 38:25.516
It was like being stranded
in the 17th century.

38:25.521 --> 38:26.902
Well how did you get home?

38:27.022 --> 38:28.723
Gave a policeman a hand-job.

38:29.363 --> 38:32.491
I think that's how I first
became interested in the law.

38:34.644 --> 38:36.233
Right, well, what's next?

38:36.732 --> 38:38.108
Insurance.

38:38.998 --> 38:40.882
Fuck, this is gonna take all day.

38:48.210 --> 38:49.410
Are you feeling better?

39:03.098 --> 39:04.298
I don't smoke.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.684
Not even now that you're a real woman?

39:07.518 --> 39:08.718
Oh!

39:12.218 --> 39:13.418
So what now?

39:14.454 --> 39:16.958
My womb will shed for 4 to 5 days.

39:16.958 --> 39:19.463
And then I wait a month
until the next time.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.656
In about 40 years, I dry up again.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.229
They teach you that in school?

39:26.418 --> 39:28.513
- Google.
- Yeah?

39:28.845 --> 39:30.284
4 to 5 days?

39:30.543 --> 39:31.743
Mostly.

39:32.605 --> 39:33.877
Do you feel any different?

39:35.094 --> 39:36.506
I'm not in pain.

39:37.228 --> 39:38.772
Mom always gets pains.

39:38.795 --> 39:40.257
You... you look in pain.

39:40.288 --> 39:43.658
That's because it's like 50
degrees in here, but thanks.

39:49.166 --> 39:51.409
Do you want to bunk school? Celebrate?

39:52.354 --> 39:54.711
I can't, it's my induction, remember?

39:56.735 --> 39:57.935
Shall I take you?

39:59.001 --> 40:01.070
They love me at your fancy school.

40:01.722 --> 40:04.041
They think I'm a proper gentleman.

40:12.215 --> 40:14.563
- What else can I take?
- Whatever you need.

40:15.439 --> 40:16.647
Is anyone free?

40:16.720 --> 40:18.231
Oh, no, it's fine. I can do it.

40:18.351 --> 40:21.628
Well, Rosie's free. She's just
coming from the Islington Terrace job.

40:22.327 --> 40:24.016
We own a cleaning company.

40:24.225 --> 40:26.328
- Don't be so stubborn.
- I'm not being stubborn.

40:26.423 --> 40:27.623
Rosie can help.

40:28.112 --> 40:29.979
- It'll be fine.
- I know it'll be fine.

40:29.986 --> 40:31.186
I'm a big girl.

40:31.318 --> 40:34.574
I can make phone calls to
insurance companies all by myself.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.301
You're right.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.502
Sorry.

40:39.901 --> 40:41.101
How was last night?

40:44.046 --> 40:45.246
Fine.

40:45.247 --> 40:46.447
Dull.

41:06.606 --> 41:07.806
What are you doing?

41:07.807 --> 41:09.142
I need to know your decision.

41:09.914 --> 41:11.120
The answer is no.

41:11.121 --> 41:12.321
You sure?

41:12.630 --> 41:14.273
It's not something I can do.

41:15.422 --> 41:17.266
I met two friends of your brother earlier.

41:17.570 --> 41:19.733
Here from their mother
country, looking for Martin.

41:19.751 --> 41:21.763
Some dispute they've
had over drugs and money.

41:21.768 --> 41:23.784
Muscley guy and a younger one.

41:23.807 --> 41:25.219
Smarter. Who were they?

41:25.419 --> 41:26.908
Nico and Romey.

41:27.681 --> 41:29.576
- Romain.
- Probably.

41:30.910 --> 41:33.188
- And what did you tell them?
- Do the job I've asked you

41:33.229 --> 41:36.830
or I will send Romey and Nico after
your brother, and after your home.

41:36.863 --> 41:38.102
Get your stuff.

41:57.217 --> 41:58.961
Sure you don't want me to come in with you?

42:00.287 --> 42:01.849
No, I'll be okay from here.

42:04.247 --> 42:05.447
Are you nervous?

42:05.719 --> 42:06.919
No.

42:08.156 --> 42:10.445
Everybody's nervous on the first day.

42:13.749 --> 42:14.949
You'll be great.

42:18.072 --> 42:19.625
Thank you for this morning.

42:20.113 --> 42:21.313
You're welcome.

42:33.758 --> 42:34.958
Where are they?

42:37.741 --> 42:40.898
I got 5 minutes before I
pick up my son from nursery.

42:41.177 --> 42:42.377
Who are you?

42:42.932 --> 42:44.997
- My name is Martin Bastière.
- What do you know?

42:45.592 --> 42:48.130
I know Nelson Clay shot
and killed Frank McElroy.

42:48.144 --> 42:49.456
Why should I believe you?

42:49.680 --> 42:53.203
Because you haven't been able to contact
Frank since I've been here yesterday.

42:55.051 --> 42:57.285
Maybe Nelson knows you stole from him.

42:59.792 --> 43:01.231
What's your interest in this?

43:01.610 --> 43:03.756
My brother is a very talented man.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.520
He's a cleaner.

43:06.159 --> 43:08.261
He can manipulate a situation,

43:08.381 --> 43:10.127
a crime scene for example,

43:10.635 --> 43:12.690
so that it tells the story you want.

43:13.551 --> 43:16.790
- He can even make it disappear completely.
- Forensics?

43:16.790 --> 43:19.073
We're better than them. I work with him.

43:19.494 --> 43:20.838
I'm his consigliere.

43:23.445 --> 43:25.012
Now you've come to see us.

43:26.284 --> 43:28.009
Frank said you could be trusted.

43:30.484 --> 43:32.600
Nelson Clay is blackmailing us.

43:33.318 --> 43:36.502
He's forcing us to participate
in death, in killings.

43:37.566 --> 43:40.251
- And?
- And I'm offering you our services,

43:40.265 --> 43:43.203
in exchange for your
protection against Nelson Clay

43:43.235 --> 43:45.850
and a little problem that has
been following me from France.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.247
We'll work for you.

43:56.045 --> 43:57.471
This is a sales pitch?

43:58.037 --> 43:59.237
Yes.

44:04.608 --> 44:05.808
Very good.

44:09.657 --> 44:10.857
Show me.

44:11.164 --> 44:12.368
Okay.

44:17.300 --> 44:18.500
Very good.

44:30.748 --> 44:33.577
- I... think he's been called away.
- Thanks, Maureen.

44:33.623 --> 44:35.362
Rosie won't be long.
Can I get you anything?

44:35.376 --> 44:36.670
No, I'm just on hold.

44:36.900 --> 44:38.100
Thanks.

44:44.016 --> 44:46.137
_

44:51.527 --> 44:53.395
MORTGAGE

44:59.419 --> 45:03.162
_

45:28.919 --> 45:30.119
It's not complicated.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.320
Won't take long.

46:06.211 --> 46:08.368
Beautiful piece of music this.

47:18.810 --> 47:21.221
No, I'm not asking for access
to the account, I'm just

47:21.253 --> 47:23.928
asking for confirmation
that the account exists.

47:28.327 --> 47:30.148
Okay, well, is it possible

47:30.194 --> 47:33.462
for there to be a mortgage against
my home, which I'm co-owner of,

47:33.462 --> 47:34.707
without my knowledge?

47:34.962 --> 47:36.166
Yes?

47:37.241 --> 47:39.564
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine. Thank you.

47:45.123 --> 47:47.084
Okay, it's almost a million pounds

47:47.102 --> 47:48.400
borrowed against my house.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.244
Don't you think I have a right to know?

47:52.615 --> 47:53.815
Jean?

47:56.622 --> 47:57.822
I'm proud of you

47:58.949 --> 48:00.502
for standing up to me today.

48:00.970 --> 48:02.759
Frank said you'll kill me too one day.

48:02.955 --> 48:04.236
That's a possibility.

48:05.075 --> 48:07.774
That doesn't mean we can't have a
good relationship in the meantime.

48:09.373 --> 48:11.352
I'd like you to bring your wife,

48:11.353 --> 48:12.553
over for dinner.

48:12.728 --> 48:14.994
- Absolutely not.
- I insist.

48:15.876 --> 48:18.459
Sonny gets back tonight.
I was planning to cook.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.121
Around 8 would be good.

48:24.063 --> 48:25.263
Hey.

48:25.460 --> 48:26.660
Where are you going?

48:26.820 --> 48:29.675
Work thing of Dad's. Dinner with a client.

48:29.675 --> 48:32.237
I'd rather burn matchsticks
under my fingernails.

48:34.935 --> 48:36.931
Have you got anything
you want to talk through?

48:36.932 --> 48:38.132
No.

48:40.373 --> 48:42.675
I'm so, so sorry about today.

48:43.024 --> 48:45.150
Uncle Martin was really
good. He saved the day.

48:45.795 --> 48:47.166
Not for the first time.

48:47.289 --> 48:48.979
I would have freaked out otherwise.

48:48.980 --> 48:51.291
You had totally the wrong stuff for my age.

48:51.458 --> 48:53.379
He went to the shop and
bought one of everything.

48:53.379 --> 48:55.271
I don't think I had gone
to school if he hadn't.

48:55.883 --> 48:57.244
Right, what are you talking about?

48:57.248 --> 48:59.059
I ended up using one of those all-night

48:59.082 --> 49:00.507
pad-ultra things.

49:00.667 --> 49:02.147
Seemed the safest.

49:02.818 --> 49:04.027
Today?

49:05.959 --> 49:09.325
Oh honey, why didn't you
call me? I'm so sorry!

49:09.326 --> 49:10.329
We were fine.

49:10.330 --> 49:12.647
But that's not the point,
I should have been here.

49:15.813 --> 49:18.033
Mom, I need a way to get money.

49:18.034 --> 49:19.234
Don't interrupt.

49:20.042 --> 49:21.242
Sorry.

49:21.876 --> 49:23.777
Listen, we'll go and get supplies tomorrow.

49:23.788 --> 49:25.200
Okay? We'll go to the chemist.

49:25.210 --> 49:26.621
How can I get some money?

49:26.842 --> 49:28.392
- What for?
- Hey, Dad.

49:28.442 --> 49:30.247
- Hey.
- For supplies.

49:30.360 --> 49:31.560
You look good.

49:31.883 --> 49:33.083
Thank you.

49:33.444 --> 49:35.254
So can we talk about it in the morning?

49:46.289 --> 49:48.332
How did you and Nelson first meet?

49:50.764 --> 49:54.853
I worked at the hospice where
his first wife died of cancer.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.803
It's...

50:00.832 --> 50:03.360
what it trained us. A nurse.

50:03.610 --> 50:05.515
That can't have been easy

50:06.198 --> 50:07.398
being...

50:07.838 --> 50:10.641
second wife under those circumstances.

50:10.761 --> 50:12.680
It has its moments.

50:16.884 --> 50:18.561
You didn't know

50:18.791 --> 50:20.999
that your husband had
been in care, did you?

50:23.873 --> 50:25.073
No.

50:26.223 --> 50:27.908
Don't be upset about it.

50:30.675 --> 50:33.292
Some people never come to
terms with being in care.

50:33.487 --> 50:35.731
Something very bad happened...

50:36.325 --> 50:40.050
to them when they were kids.
Uh, to Jean and his brother.

50:41.659 --> 50:43.823
They're both still battered by it.

50:46.980 --> 50:48.830
I think I met the brother.

50:49.384 --> 50:51.175
- Martin?
- Hmm.

50:51.627 --> 50:54.120
- He's a law unto himself.
- Ah.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.967
Too many secrets.

51:05.619 --> 51:07.392
What does she do?

51:12.036 --> 51:15.452
There's no way she's
content with playing house.

51:17.930 --> 51:20.156
She has a furniture design business.

51:20.276 --> 51:22.214
Well, she's just starting up.

51:24.103 --> 51:25.425
That's what she studied.

51:25.443 --> 51:27.811
Then she got pregnant, and life happened.

51:28.183 --> 51:29.540
Is she good?

51:30.780 --> 51:32.909
She's good at everything she tries.

51:37.550 --> 51:38.920
For today.

51:39.306 --> 51:41.258
Keeps it professional...

51:44.495 --> 51:46.101
Julie's lovely.

52:02.180 --> 52:03.795
I'm sorry about tonight.

52:03.839 --> 52:05.400
Which part?

52:05.746 --> 52:07.280
All of it.

52:08.637 --> 52:10.996
You shouldn't be exposed to those things.

52:12.406 --> 52:14.402
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

52:15.812 --> 52:19.697
We were put in care, after my
father died, for a couple of years.

52:22.012 --> 52:23.537
It wasn't great.

52:25.684 --> 52:27.804
- Where was your mother?
- She was

52:27.848 --> 52:30.376
getting lost in drink around that time.

52:31.174 --> 52:33.063
Because of your father?

52:33.090 --> 52:34.447
Partly.

52:39.306 --> 52:40.991
She had a lover.

52:44.698 --> 52:46.270
Do you lie to me much?

52:46.304 --> 52:48.160
What? No.

52:49.248 --> 52:50.995
What kind of question is that?

52:52.429 --> 52:53.848
Sorry.

52:54.973 --> 52:56.270
Sorry.

52:56.827 --> 52:58.752
Probably just the wine.

53:00.845 --> 53:04.158
So this is where we keep all the
chemical products that we use to clean.

53:04.278 --> 53:08.250
And this is the sponges, the tea
bag, the gloves, you name it...

53:08.251 --> 53:10.637
Uh, this is the common room

53:11.036 --> 53:12.748
and this is the locker room.

53:13.076 --> 53:16.313
So, what do you want me to do? A demo?

53:16.659 --> 53:17.945
Food dye?

53:17.946 --> 53:20.278
- Something we use for training?
- That won't be necessary.

53:20.540 --> 53:22.060
This is good.

53:34.303 --> 53:36.774
He's got a beautiful young wife.

53:37.591 --> 53:39.144
Mother to his son.

53:41.555 --> 53:43.176
And he hits her.

53:53.635 --> 53:56.574
Okay. Show me.

53:58.567 --> 54:00.651
Don't turn on the shower.

54:01.945 --> 54:04.313
Do it like you would if you were outside.

54:05.565 --> 54:06.880
Come on.

54:08.491 --> 54:10.079
We're your new friends.
