00:56.933 --> 00:58.933
Carlos Felipe.

01:04.581 --> 01:06.582
_

01:06.607 --> 01:08.607
_

01:11.054 --> 01:13.054
_

01:13.079 --> 01:15.079
_

01:16.072 --> 01:17.572
_

01:18.073 --> 01:20.073
_

01:27.867 --> 01:31.367
_

01:31.392 --> 01:34.392
_

01:35.351 --> 01:37.351
_

02:32.306 --> 02:33.506
We're on track.

02:33.508 --> 02:35.508
I'm holding Narciso,

02:35.510 --> 02:37.910
and the rest of the counselors are gone.

02:37.912 --> 02:40.513
But the rinche's still alive.

02:40.515 --> 02:42.381
No, he's not.

02:42.383 --> 02:44.984
Who do you think did this to him?

02:44.986 --> 02:49.555
I ripped into Ranger Gonzalez...

02:49.557 --> 02:51.791
And held nothing back.

02:51.793 --> 02:55.728
He should have shriveled to blood and bone.

02:55.730 --> 02:57.997
That's not possible.

02:57.999 --> 02:59.832
You think the bloodline has survived?

02:59.834 --> 03:01.067
Doesn't matter now.

03:01.069 --> 03:04.036
You are gonna find him and finish him.

03:05.806 --> 03:07.340
What about Richard?

03:07.342 --> 03:10.009
- He needs time.
- He doesn't have it.

03:10.011 --> 03:13.079
Diosa, share yourself with him.

03:13.081 --> 03:15.748
Once he feeds, he'll never look back.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.352
The desire has to come from him.

03:19.354 --> 03:21.887
Or else he's useless for us.

03:24.758 --> 03:27.793
No one knows this better than you, Carlos.

03:27.795 --> 03:31.831
You take care of your end,
and I'll take care of mine.

03:35.869 --> 03:38.704
It's almost over.

03:38.706 --> 03:42.775
We are so close, we can taste it.

03:47.814 --> 03:50.850
Now bring me the rinche's head.

03:56.858 --> 03:58.724
You're not a thinking man, are you?

03:58.726 --> 04:00.960
If you were, you would've let this go.

04:00.962 --> 04:03.829
No, but you're like one of
those junkyard dogs, right?

04:04.865 --> 04:06.699
Just can't stay on your leash.

04:06.701 --> 04:08.634
I came to do what I got to do,

04:08.636 --> 04:10.403
and I ain't leaving till I do it.

04:10.405 --> 04:11.971
Let him go.

04:14.107 --> 04:16.541
This ain't your fight, padre.

04:16.543 --> 04:18.476
And it ain't your call to kill him.

04:20.415 --> 04:23.082
We already saw him get
killed, but he lived.

04:23.084 --> 04:24.617
He might know something.

04:24.619 --> 04:26.886
She's right. I know a way out.

04:26.888 --> 04:29.121
- But you're too stupid to listen.
- Shut up!

04:29.123 --> 04:30.990
This guy thinks he's dirty Harry.

04:30.992 --> 04:32.758
You out for blood?

04:32.760 --> 04:35.161
That's good, 'cause
you're gonna die bloody.

04:35.163 --> 04:36.729
I said let him go.

04:36.731 --> 04:38.564
This is Old Testament, padre.

04:38.566 --> 04:41.434
My Scott is gone because you kidnapped us

04:41.436 --> 04:42.968
and forced us to come here.

04:42.970 --> 04:47.006
By your scripture, you
raise that blade, I can...

04:50.877 --> 04:52.778
You see this? Huh?

04:52.780 --> 04:56.015
Looks like this little piggy's
already had a close encounter, huh?

04:56.017 --> 04:58.184
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.

04:58.186 --> 04:59.919
Nothing was wrong with
those bikers, either,

04:59.921 --> 05:01.720
till they got up and they started chomping.

05:01.722 --> 05:03.055
I know a way out...

05:03.057 --> 05:05.558
Down that trapdoor over
there, through a hole.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.759
Down to where?

05:06.761 --> 05:08.928
It's a grinder... for flesh.

05:08.930 --> 05:10.729
Get past, there might be an exit.

05:10.731 --> 05:12.097
Thanks for the tip, but it's
the end of the line for you.

05:12.099 --> 05:13.699
Leaving him behind is
like pulling the trigger.

05:13.701 --> 05:15.067
I say we vote on it.

05:15.069 --> 05:17.203
Does this look like a parish hall to you?

05:17.205 --> 05:20.539
All those in favor of leaving
the Ranger, raise your hand!

05:30.016 --> 05:31.217
Kate.

05:31.219 --> 05:32.785
I'm sorry, Daddy,

05:32.787 --> 05:35.488
but you saw what happened to those bikers.

05:35.490 --> 05:37.056
He could turn on us.

05:39.759 --> 05:41.026
Professor?

05:45.232 --> 05:46.932
Come on, man. Give me a break.

05:46.934 --> 05:50.803
I'm sorry, sheriff. It's purely academic.

06:27.674 --> 06:28.974
Aah!

06:28.976 --> 06:30.776
This ain't over.

06:30.778 --> 06:33.012
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.

06:33.014 --> 06:35.614
Unless you actually do
turn into one of them.

06:35.616 --> 06:36.949
Then you'll be part of the family.

06:36.951 --> 06:38.817
Like Richie?

06:38.819 --> 06:41.587
What do you think she's gonna do to him?

06:41.589 --> 06:43.155
You and your brother are
gonna dangle from a rope!

06:43.157 --> 06:44.890
I swear!

06:50.997 --> 06:54.066
All right, hold on a second.
Let me think out loud.

06:54.068 --> 06:56.769
There was a chain hanging
from the pool table.

06:56.771 --> 06:58.170
We can wrap that around a crossbar

06:58.172 --> 07:00.172
and use it to cantilever
each one of us down.

07:00.174 --> 07:02.107
If we double the chain up,

07:02.109 --> 07:04.777
should give us about 200
pounds of tensile strength.

07:04.779 --> 07:06.612
Yeah, you keep working on that, MacGyver.

07:07.647 --> 07:09.782
Or... You could do that.

07:09.784 --> 07:11.951
Come on in, guys. Water's fine.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.120
I guess.

07:22.929 --> 07:25.064
Whoa! Whoa! Careful. Careful.

07:25.066 --> 07:26.599
This is a grinder.

07:27.701 --> 07:29.168
Shotgun.

07:34.007 --> 07:35.274
- All right.
- Coming to you.

07:35.276 --> 07:36.809
- Throw me the bag.
- Yeah.

07:36.811 --> 07:38.811
One, two...

07:40.313 --> 07:41.880
Shit!

07:41.882 --> 07:43.082
Oopsie Daisy.

07:43.084 --> 07:44.750
"Oopsie Daisy"?

07:44.752 --> 07:46.752
No. You don't get to say "Oopsie Daisy".

07:46.754 --> 07:48.153
You just friggin' killed us.

07:48.155 --> 07:50.155
I'm sorry! I slipped!

07:50.157 --> 07:52.091
It's not like this place isn't
covered in blood or something.

07:52.093 --> 07:53.659
- Yeah. Just come on.
- Hey, guys!

07:53.661 --> 07:56.762
Kate, I got you girl.

07:56.764 --> 07:59.031
Oh, yeah.

08:00.734 --> 08:03.702
See? Chivalry isn't dead.

08:03.704 --> 08:04.903
Come on.

08:04.905 --> 08:06.305
Come on, Dad. You got it.

08:06.307 --> 08:08.273
Whoa! Dad!

08:08.275 --> 08:09.775
Oh, God.

08:09.777 --> 08:10.976
You okay?

08:10.978 --> 08:12.978
Aw, man.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.313
Hey, throw it here!

08:14.315 --> 08:15.714
Let's go.

08:15.716 --> 08:17.249
Careful.

08:17.251 --> 08:19.718
I'm coming.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.687
Come on, Dad.

08:21.689 --> 08:24.056
The Humanity.

09:09.169 --> 09:12.004
Richard.

09:15.775 --> 09:17.810
Richard.

09:20.815 --> 09:22.014
Get away from me!

09:22.016 --> 09:23.916
Richard, don't. You need my help.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.052
Be still.

09:27.054 --> 09:29.888
Why? So you can go all Nosferatu on me?

09:31.024 --> 09:32.958
You just stay back.

09:39.132 --> 09:41.800
You can't run from fate, Richard.

09:41.802 --> 09:43.469
You knew this day would come.

09:43.471 --> 09:46.138
You knew it when you saw me on that stage.

09:46.140 --> 09:47.406
You knew we're meant to be.

09:47.408 --> 09:49.007
'Cause you messed with my head.

09:49.009 --> 09:50.809
You made me want you, like a dog.

09:50.811 --> 09:52.077
You made me kill that woman.

09:52.079 --> 09:53.345
You freed her.

09:53.347 --> 09:54.947
I cut her eyes out.

09:56.082 --> 09:58.817
She had a family, and you
made me cut her eyes out.

09:58.819 --> 10:01.153
I was teaching you to
make a connection with her.

10:02.756 --> 10:05.023
But it's never been easy for you, has it?

10:05.025 --> 10:08.060
Simple human connection?

10:08.062 --> 10:09.361
It won't be like that with me.

10:09.363 --> 10:10.763
Yeah.

10:10.765 --> 10:12.531
Yeah, because you're not human.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.468
You're not the only one who has visions.

10:17.837 --> 10:20.506
I dreamt of you, Richard.

10:20.508 --> 10:21.974
Longed for you.

10:21.976 --> 10:24.309
I'm not gonna beg for my life.

10:24.311 --> 10:27.312
So why don't you quit playing with
your food and get it over with.

10:27.314 --> 10:29.248
I need you, Richard.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.850
All of you. I need your mind.

10:31.852 --> 10:35.387
I need your heart, your soul.

10:35.389 --> 10:37.389
It's up to you to choose.

10:37.391 --> 10:39.858
I'm not gonna let you turn me into a freak.

10:39.860 --> 10:41.426
I'm not a monster.

10:41.428 --> 10:43.061
I'm a prisoner.

10:43.997 --> 10:45.931
And you are gonna set me free.

10:50.271 --> 10:52.237
Knock knock.

10:54.374 --> 10:58.544
Bitten by la reina herself.

10:58.546 --> 11:02.147
Yet... You live and breathe.

11:03.416 --> 11:05.417
You must think you're so special.

11:05.419 --> 11:07.953
Wow, rinche.

11:07.955 --> 11:10.289
I would've thought your
weapon of choice was a noose.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.024
I'm starting to develop a taste for blood.

11:12.026 --> 11:13.592
Mm.

11:13.594 --> 11:16.028
You already killed two of my best men.

11:16.030 --> 11:18.530
Now, you must be wondering
how that happened.

11:18.532 --> 11:20.899
"How did I do that?"

11:20.901 --> 11:23.068
Not really. I was there.

11:24.037 --> 11:25.304
Yeah.

11:25.306 --> 11:27.005
But now you're here.

11:28.408 --> 11:29.875
With me.

11:32.111 --> 11:33.611
_

11:34.013 --> 11:35.414
Malparido.

11:42.989 --> 11:45.023
You're stronger now.

11:45.025 --> 11:49.061
I've drawn that out of
you... steel sharpening steel.

12:36.442 --> 12:38.343
You rejected her venom.

12:43.383 --> 12:45.117
Aaaaaah!

12:45.119 --> 12:46.351
That hurt?

12:50.390 --> 12:52.124
Aaaaah!

12:57.397 --> 12:58.997
Sangrita.

13:00.467 --> 13:03.468
Your bloodline is ancient,

13:03.470 --> 13:05.504
but you're not invincible.

13:05.506 --> 13:07.272
That is a very exclusive club.

13:07.274 --> 13:10.375
Too bad you never got past the velvet rope.

13:10.377 --> 13:13.111
Well, tonight, your story ends.

13:23.691 --> 13:25.157
Just kidding. It doesn't really hurt.

13:25.159 --> 13:27.092
But I bet this will.

13:31.164 --> 13:33.131
I know who you really are,

13:33.133 --> 13:36.001
and nothing you can say
is gonna change that.

13:36.003 --> 13:37.703
That's not really who I am.

13:37.705 --> 13:39.304
That's just a part of me.

13:39.306 --> 13:42.074
I'm finding it hard to
believe that you're even real.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.210
I'm real.

13:46.379 --> 13:47.679
And you know it.

14:01.595 --> 14:04.529
I don't have a heart, but I felt that.

14:04.531 --> 14:07.199
I'm flesh...

14:07.201 --> 14:09.468
But not flesh and blood.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.003
This is insane.

14:11.005 --> 14:14.039
It's a curse. I wasn't born like this.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.607
Let me show you.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.644
This is what I prepared you for, Richard.

14:21.414 --> 14:22.681
Let me open your eyes.

14:25.718 --> 14:28.787
I was born at the dawn of a sacred cycle,

14:28.789 --> 14:32.524
when the morning star aligned with the sun.

14:32.526 --> 14:34.760
The high priest believed

14:34.762 --> 14:37.763
I had a special connection to the gods.

14:39.332 --> 14:41.733
They brought me jewels
and flowers at first,

14:41.735 --> 14:43.769
but then they said the lords of the night

14:43.771 --> 14:47.172
had sacrificed themselves
to make the Earth.

14:47.174 --> 14:51.243
So it was only fitting that
they sacrifice their own.

15:02.256 --> 15:06.324
I couldn't let them kill
innocent people in my name...

15:07.493 --> 15:09.528
So I ran.

15:09.530 --> 15:12.464
Their priests hunted
me, and the lords decided

15:12.466 --> 15:17.602
that if I refused to spill
Human blood for them...

15:17.604 --> 15:21.073
Then they would give me an
insatiable need for it...

15:22.575 --> 15:24.342
A hunger so deep

15:24.344 --> 15:26.745
that I wouldn't be able to live without it.

15:29.248 --> 15:32.317
The hunger drew me back to this place...

15:36.489 --> 15:40.559
Where I would be forever enslaved.

15:51.471 --> 15:55.240
That was a cruel and ugly thing to do

15:55.242 --> 15:57.142
to an innocent girl.

15:57.144 --> 15:58.844
If you help me, Richie,

15:58.846 --> 16:01.113
I can finally have

16:01.115 --> 16:04.216
the only thing I've craved for centuries.

16:07.321 --> 16:09.154
Freedom.

16:12.192 --> 16:14.726
And all I have to do is give up my soul?

16:16.462 --> 16:18.330
Richard, you're dying.

16:18.332 --> 16:20.332
Yeah, so what?

16:20.334 --> 16:22.501
You want me to be cursed, like you?

16:23.569 --> 16:24.836
You call that living?

16:25.872 --> 16:28.540
What's in it for me?

16:30.209 --> 16:32.344
So, does the dean of
the archeology department

16:32.346 --> 16:33.879
approve of that getup?

16:35.382 --> 16:36.915
Not a problem.

16:36.917 --> 16:38.483
Long as I turn in

16:38.485 --> 16:41.353
the right peer-reviewed
journal now and again.

16:41.355 --> 16:44.823
You know how it is... Publish or perish.

16:44.825 --> 16:47.392
So, why "Sex Machine"?

16:47.394 --> 16:49.628
Ain't it obvious?

16:51.231 --> 16:53.832
That's a pun from my
boys'-school-Latin days...

16:53.834 --> 16:56.635
Deus Sex Machina,

16:56.637 --> 17:00.438
or, uh, "the God in the sex machine".

17:00.440 --> 17:03.475
Only boys' school I ever went
to didn't teach dead languages.

17:03.477 --> 17:07.679
Well, there's plenty of
them on the walls in here.

17:09.549 --> 17:12.317
There's something on this floor.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.519
Just stay close. Scott needs us.

17:14.521 --> 17:16.521
Focus on that.

17:16.522 --> 17:21.393
These stories are just
ancient history to most people.

17:23.195 --> 17:26.298
But I always believed the
power they spoke of was true.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.665
What power?

17:27.667 --> 17:31.736
Their blood sacrifices
summoned the Vision Serpent,

17:31.738 --> 17:35.607
giving them access to a
higher plane of consciousness.

17:35.609 --> 17:38.276
Yeah, they could see things

17:38.278 --> 17:40.478
that don't exist in our temporal reality.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.847
What? What do you mean, "temporal reality"?

17:42.849 --> 17:47.419
I mean the past, the future...
things you and I can't see.

17:47.421 --> 17:49.788
Their ancestors mapped the stars.

17:49.790 --> 17:52.891
They understood the cosmic
movements of the galaxies.

17:52.893 --> 17:55.961
Some even say that...

17:55.963 --> 17:59.664
They could communicate with alien races.

17:59.666 --> 18:02.667
Stop. Don't make this any
weirder than it already is.

18:02.669 --> 18:04.569
Now, I can do "Temple of Doom", man,

18:04.571 --> 18:07.239
but "Crystal Skull", I'm out.

18:08.574 --> 18:12.978
This place is filled with chanan markings.

18:12.980 --> 18:14.779
What do you mean?

18:14.781 --> 18:18.450
Chanan... It means "snake",
but it also means "guard".

18:18.452 --> 18:20.852
What are they guarding?

18:20.854 --> 18:23.788
Duh. The underworld.

18:23.790 --> 18:25.757
Oh, great.

18:37.870 --> 18:40.405
I guess I shouldn't be afraid.

18:40.407 --> 18:42.707
If I die, I go to heaven to be with Mama.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.709
She'll be standing there
right next to Jesus,

18:44.711 --> 18:46.378
waiting for me.

18:47.847 --> 18:49.848
Kate.

18:49.850 --> 18:51.683
What?

18:51.685 --> 18:55.420
There's something I have to
tell you about your mother.

18:55.422 --> 18:57.389
What is it?

18:59.358 --> 19:01.493
You got to stay strong.

19:01.495 --> 19:03.695
That's how we're gonna get through this.

19:03.697 --> 19:05.930
Daddy, what is it?

19:09.503 --> 19:10.769
What was that?

19:13.440 --> 19:14.939
There's something coming. Come on!

19:15.708 --> 19:16.975
Wait!

19:19.011 --> 19:21.446
Wait! Don't leave us!

19:29.856 --> 19:31.056
On three.

19:31.058 --> 19:32.457
Come on, Daddy.

19:32.459 --> 19:33.925
- One...
- Come on.

19:33.927 --> 19:35.393
Two...

19:35.861 --> 19:38.663
Three.

19:38.665 --> 19:40.598
- Close the door.
- Shut up.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.867
They're chanan! Close the door! Shut up!

19:42.869 --> 19:44.936
- Damn it, man!
- Come on.

19:44.938 --> 19:47.072
Wait! Wait!

19:47.074 --> 19:49.074
- Close the...
- Jacob!

19:56.549 --> 19:58.917
- Please!
- Come on! Come on!

20:05.791 --> 20:07.992
Find something to block the door!

20:07.994 --> 20:10.095
Here! Here!

20:15.702 --> 20:18.036
You can thank me later.

20:20.540 --> 20:22.974
Chivalry's dead now.

20:26.979 --> 20:28.980
Preacher, check this out.

20:28.982 --> 20:30.715
It's cargo.

20:30.717 --> 20:32.917
Probably from all the
truckers and travelers

20:32.919 --> 20:35.587
these buzzards have been
snacking on for years.

20:36.856 --> 20:39.791
Or maybe centuries.

20:39.793 --> 20:42.427
Jesus, they got...

20:42.429 --> 20:44.996
they got stuff here that
goes back who knows how long.

20:46.466 --> 20:48.032
Shit!

20:48.034 --> 20:49.934
Welcome to the party, baby.

20:51.257 --> 20:53.012
Do you want to put down the
death stick, road block?

20:53.038 --> 20:54.907
Do I have a smile on my face?

20:54.909 --> 20:56.609
Does it look like I'm happy to see you?

20:56.611 --> 20:58.877
News flash... We're friendlies.

20:58.879 --> 21:00.379
Okay? We're not those freaks.

21:00.381 --> 21:02.681
I want you out of here.
Go back to where you came.

21:02.683 --> 21:04.283
There's nothing but
death and misery that way.

21:04.285 --> 21:06.952
What do you think is on
the other end of this?

21:06.954 --> 21:08.153
- Stop!
- Kate!

21:08.155 --> 21:10.155
Stop. No, Dad.

21:10.157 --> 21:12.157
Mister, my brother is lost down here,

21:12.159 --> 21:13.726
and we're trying to find him.

21:13.828 --> 21:16.462
You never will. Nothing's
gonna survive down here.

21:16.464 --> 21:18.363
You survived.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.934
How long have you been down here?

21:21.936 --> 21:23.969
A month.

21:23.971 --> 21:25.170
A year.

21:25.172 --> 21:26.772
Time's like a ribbon... Finds a way

21:26.774 --> 21:28.006
of knotting itself into a bow.

21:28.008 --> 21:29.208
Okay, buddy, listen.

21:29.210 --> 21:31.443
We got to get at this stuff, okay?

21:31.445 --> 21:33.812
We got to find a way to defend ourselves.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.013
You understand?

21:35.015 --> 21:38.317
I'm a bad judge of character.

21:38.319 --> 21:40.385
Either you go back the way you came...

21:42.088 --> 21:44.289
or you play the wheel of misfortune,

21:44.291 --> 21:45.791
like everybody else.

21:45.793 --> 21:47.226
You want to play games?

21:47.228 --> 21:49.828
I'm not playing the game. You are.

22:01.241 --> 22:02.875
It's your lucky day.

22:02.877 --> 22:05.244
Shopping spree... You get 10 minutes

22:05.246 --> 22:08.080
to get whatever you want
and ease on down the road.

22:08.082 --> 22:10.115
Fair enough.

22:10.117 --> 22:11.784
Wait. Hold on a second.

22:11.786 --> 22:14.520
You've been deeper into this temple.

22:14.522 --> 22:17.189
Fought my way to the heart of it.

22:17.191 --> 22:19.158
Well?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.793
What happened?

22:24.264 --> 22:25.898
It showed me things.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.099
Things? What things?

22:27.101 --> 22:30.469
If hell has circles...

22:30.471 --> 22:34.006
You just stepped off the bottom rung.

22:34.008 --> 22:36.141
This entire night was
about getting Richie. Why?

22:36.143 --> 22:38.811
What do you care? You're
not a lawman anymore.

22:38.813 --> 22:40.145
- Shut up!
- This is the place of dead roads.

22:40.147 --> 22:42.214
She took Richie. What
does she want with him?

22:42.216 --> 22:43.949
She's using him.

22:43.951 --> 22:45.217
For what?

22:46.553 --> 22:49.354
You'll be an immortal among mortals,

22:49.356 --> 22:51.089
a king among men.

22:51.091 --> 22:53.058
You'll have everything you've ever wanted.

22:54.294 --> 22:56.562
All you have to do is ask.

22:56.564 --> 22:58.564
Sounds like another trick to me.

22:58.566 --> 23:01.166
You've felt that power
that I'm talking about.

23:01.168 --> 23:03.502
You want it. You're just afraid of it.

23:03.504 --> 23:06.038
Yeah, I've heard this story before...

23:06.040 --> 23:08.440
young girl plays lost and afraid,

23:08.442 --> 23:11.510
hooks a guy, and he falls in love with her.

23:11.512 --> 23:15.480
He'll do anything to protect her.

23:15.482 --> 23:17.382
Next thing he knows, he's lying facedown

23:17.384 --> 23:19.551
in a swimming pool,
reading his own narration.

23:19.553 --> 23:21.253
I swear... it's not a trick.

23:21.255 --> 23:23.055
Mm.

23:23.057 --> 23:25.123
What about your boyfriend?

23:25.125 --> 23:27.392
You think I'm in love with Carlos?

23:27.394 --> 23:30.929
Carlos Felipe's nothing
you should worry about.

23:30.931 --> 23:34.099
Good? Evil?

23:34.101 --> 23:36.335
I've been alive for five centuries,

23:36.337 --> 23:38.604
and I still don't
understand the difference.

23:38.606 --> 23:41.340
It is never that simple.

23:41.342 --> 23:44.009
I'm moving on to jury and
executioner unless you start talking.

23:44.011 --> 23:46.278
It all ends tonight.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.213
But to understand the end,

23:48.215 --> 23:51.283
you must understand the beginning.

23:51.285 --> 23:53.285
I was a soldier...

23:55.189 --> 23:57.189
A conqueror...

23:59.359 --> 24:02.160
A disciple of God.

24:02.162 --> 24:04.563
Well, one God.

24:09.407 --> 24:11.907
_

24:14.541 --> 24:16.008
Hey!

24:16.033 --> 24:17.533
_

24:17.558 --> 24:21.058
_

24:21.083 --> 24:23.083
_

24:23.145 --> 24:28.145
_

24:30.682 --> 24:32.682
_

24:34.543 --> 24:36.043
_

24:39.573 --> 24:42.573
_

24:42.598 --> 24:45.098
_

24:45.437 --> 24:47.937
_

24:48.262 --> 24:50.762
_

24:51.484 --> 24:55.484
_

24:58.686 --> 25:02.955
I convinced the natives to
show me one of their temples.

26:12.492 --> 26:14.493
I became her servant.

26:14.495 --> 26:18.363
I fed her, as I have done to this night,

26:18.365 --> 26:23.035
to keep the death lords
sated and to keep her alive.

26:23.037 --> 26:26.338
What I do, I do for the woman I love.

26:26.340 --> 26:28.507
You know what they say...

26:28.509 --> 26:31.043
nothing in any world is free.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.456
_

26:33.485 --> 26:34.985
_

26:35.010 --> 26:37.510
_

26:37.535 --> 26:39.535
_

26:39.560 --> 26:41.060
_

26:41.085 --> 26:42.585
_

26:42.652 --> 26:44.152
_

27:02.109 --> 27:03.809
She never asked me to be like her.

27:03.811 --> 27:05.544
I begged her for it.

27:11.417 --> 27:13.218
I wanted power...

27:13.220 --> 27:15.087
Eternal life...

27:15.089 --> 27:17.823
The fountain of youth...

27:17.825 --> 27:20.358
And the most beautiful woman in the world.

27:22.195 --> 27:24.162
He did it for me.

27:24.164 --> 27:25.697
He loves you.

27:25.699 --> 27:27.499
He doesn't love me.

27:29.368 --> 27:31.203
He worships me.

27:31.205 --> 27:32.704
That is not love.

27:32.706 --> 27:34.406
So you bet on the wrong horse.

27:34.408 --> 27:36.108
He's not the man I thought he was.

27:36.110 --> 27:38.844
Even after 500 years,
he's driven by greed...

27:38.846 --> 27:41.580
The very thing that brought him to me.

27:41.582 --> 27:43.448
He makes a good profit

27:43.450 --> 27:45.417
from my enslavement to the lords.

27:45.419 --> 27:46.751
And because of that,

27:46.753 --> 27:49.254
he lacks conviction to pass the trials.

27:49.256 --> 27:51.723
What trials?

27:51.725 --> 27:54.860
The ones you'll have to
face in order to set me free.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.396
Am I evil?

27:58.398 --> 28:01.733
Who really deserves the
iron fist of punishment...

28:01.735 --> 28:04.269
The slave or the masters?

28:05.571 --> 28:08.707
That's a sad story, but
it ends the same way.

28:08.709 --> 28:11.476
- Killing me won't make a difference.
- Sure it will.

28:11.478 --> 28:13.612
Hundreds of innocent people
won't be murdered every night.

28:13.614 --> 28:14.846
Innocents?

28:14.848 --> 28:16.615
Have you seen the crowd out there?

28:16.617 --> 28:18.617
What about the girls that got
carved up along the border...

28:18.619 --> 28:20.719
The ones you made Richie kill?

28:20.721 --> 28:22.621
Richie never killed them.

28:22.623 --> 28:25.824
The bank teller was his first and only.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.827
Oh, still the lawman.

28:28.829 --> 28:31.496
I told you... That's
not who you are anymore.

28:31.498 --> 28:34.299
- I haven't changed.
- You are who you've always been.

28:34.301 --> 28:38.570
In this realm and all others,
you're just a white hat.

28:38.572 --> 28:41.239
Which is why I'm going to break you in half

28:41.241 --> 28:42.908
when I get out of this chair!

28:42.910 --> 28:44.843
"In this realm and all others"?
You're saying this is destiny?

28:44.845 --> 28:47.479
It is a nightmare, rinche.

28:47.481 --> 28:49.648
You came on a mission of blood,

28:49.650 --> 28:52.584
but what you found was much thicker.

28:52.586 --> 28:55.453
Ooh. And it's pulling you.

28:55.455 --> 28:58.390
Killing the Geckos may
avenge your partner's murder,

28:58.392 --> 29:00.325
but it will never satisfy you.

29:00.327 --> 29:01.526
I didn't ask for this fight.

29:01.528 --> 29:03.395
Oh. Rangers don't go looking for trouble.

29:03.397 --> 29:05.263
- Trouble finds them.
- Exactamundo.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.464
We always have a choice.

29:06.466 --> 29:07.832
Not for you.

29:07.834 --> 29:10.669
Oh, and, Frederico, nothing is ever free.

29:10.671 --> 29:12.737
You will pay a steep price for this.

29:12.739 --> 29:17.576
You will never see
Margaret and Billy again.

29:44.972 --> 29:46.371
What a twist.

29:46.373 --> 29:47.639
I'll see you two in hell.

29:47.641 --> 29:49.274
I'm just gonna take a little off the top.

29:52.411 --> 29:54.312
Rinche sausage.

29:57.783 --> 30:00.919
Did you do everything I told you to do?

30:00.921 --> 30:02.787
I saw Santanico.

30:02.789 --> 30:04.389
You were right.

30:04.391 --> 30:06.258
She chose Richie over you.

30:10.864 --> 30:12.264
Go.

30:42.562 --> 30:44.296
Time's up.

30:44.298 --> 30:45.764
This'll work.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.001
He should come with us.

30:54.708 --> 30:56.841
You should talk to him.

30:56.843 --> 30:59.844
I can't judge a man I just met.

30:59.846 --> 31:02.447
Besides, he's lost hope.

31:02.449 --> 31:05.950
Once a person does that,
there's nothing you can do.

31:05.952 --> 31:09.387
I don't understand how a
person can get like that.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.890
That's 'cause you have
a light in your soul...

31:11.892 --> 31:13.792
Always leads you away from darkness.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.001
There it is.

31:23.003 --> 31:25.970
Your one-way ticket's
about to get punched.

31:25.972 --> 31:28.406
But don't come crawling back.

31:28.408 --> 31:31.376
'Cause once you go through
there, I'm shutting the door.

31:32.411 --> 31:35.380
You keep acting like you
don't care if we live or die,

31:35.382 --> 31:36.715
but you keep helping us.

31:36.717 --> 31:39.084
Why don't you help us
fight our way out of here?

31:39.086 --> 31:41.853
You know your way around
down there, don't you?

31:41.855 --> 31:43.988
I'm not partial to suicide missions.

31:43.990 --> 31:46.091
My brother's down there...

31:46.093 --> 31:48.360
Alone, in the dark.

31:48.362 --> 31:49.694
Kate, the man has made up his mind.

31:49.696 --> 31:50.895
Wait.

31:50.897 --> 31:54.366
My family might survive...

31:54.368 --> 31:56.568
If we stick together...

31:56.570 --> 31:59.537
Because we're better together.

31:59.539 --> 32:02.640
When we're alone, we're lost.

32:05.378 --> 32:09.147
You say that you're surviving,
but you're just rotting away.

32:09.149 --> 32:14.586
This place... Will mess with your mind.

32:14.588 --> 32:16.688
It will dig deep down into your brain

32:16.690 --> 32:18.456
and stir up the most heinous shit.

32:21.594 --> 32:23.128
Last time I was in there...

32:24.663 --> 32:26.931
I was in Fallujah,

32:26.933 --> 32:30.902
130 degrees in the reeds and smoke,

32:30.904 --> 32:32.537
dying of heat stroke.

32:32.539 --> 32:34.739
They dropped ordnance.

32:34.741 --> 32:36.941
Command sends me out to do a dead check.

32:36.943 --> 32:39.878
I find a little boy.

32:41.414 --> 32:43.648
Shell done torn him in half.

32:43.650 --> 32:46.484
No clothes on, crawling to me,

32:46.486 --> 32:49.621
life just bleeding out of him.

32:49.623 --> 32:53.425
I wanted so bad to put
him out of his misery,

32:53.427 --> 32:54.826
but I can't.

32:54.828 --> 32:58.029
And he's just screaming.

32:58.031 --> 33:00.064
And no matter what I did,

33:00.066 --> 33:02.167
I just can't.

33:02.169 --> 33:04.669
Do anything to help him.

33:04.671 --> 33:08.506
So the dogs had to come and finish the job.

33:11.644 --> 33:15.447
Don't be afraid of what's in there.

33:15.449 --> 33:17.949
Be afraid of what's in here.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.888
All right, enough.

33:25.691 --> 33:27.492
It's been real.

33:29.929 --> 33:33.465
I hope you find your way out, Mr. Frost.

33:33.467 --> 33:35.900
"Sergeant".

33:35.902 --> 33:38.002
Sergeant Frost.

33:44.210 --> 33:45.743
God bless.

34:18.177 --> 34:20.612
Katey.

34:22.248 --> 34:24.248
Did you guys hear that?

34:25.518 --> 34:27.150
Dad?

34:27.152 --> 34:28.553
Wait!

34:28.554 --> 34:30.788
Katey.

34:37.196 --> 34:39.130
Hello?

34:46.172 --> 34:48.806
Katey.

34:50.242 --> 34:52.277
Hello?

35:04.690 --> 35:07.225
Hello?

35:12.264 --> 35:13.998
Mama?

35:15.568 --> 35:19.003
No, this... this can't be real.

35:19.005 --> 35:21.973
I stood before that congregation...

35:21.975 --> 35:23.708
What are you...

35:23.710 --> 35:25.076
And I lied.

35:25.078 --> 35:27.111
Mama, what are you talking about?

35:27.113 --> 35:30.281
I told them he saved my life.

35:32.251 --> 35:34.152
But it was a lie.

35:34.154 --> 35:38.256
You can't save a life
that's not worth saving.

35:38.258 --> 35:39.757
No.

35:39.759 --> 35:42.026
It's not your fault, Jacob. It's mine.

35:42.028 --> 35:43.995
I've been a burden on this family,

35:43.997 --> 35:46.097
and they'd be better off without me.

35:46.099 --> 35:47.799
No.

35:47.801 --> 35:50.001
You're old enough to take
care of yourselves now.

35:50.003 --> 35:51.669
You don't need me anymore.

35:52.605 --> 35:53.972
I have to go.

35:53.974 --> 35:56.107
What are you doing?

35:56.109 --> 35:57.842
Mama, stop.

35:57.844 --> 36:01.179
Stop it! Stop! Mom, stop!

36:01.181 --> 36:03.114
Please... stop!!

36:04.317 --> 36:05.984
You all right?

36:05.986 --> 36:08.119
You made a sound like you
lost your breath or something.

36:08.121 --> 36:10.622
Kate, what is it?

36:12.392 --> 36:14.058
Kate, what's wrong?

36:17.030 --> 36:19.364
- Kate! Kate!
- What happened?

36:33.146 --> 36:35.880
Help!!

36:39.118 --> 36:40.752
Dad.

36:44.690 --> 36:46.824
Help!

36:46.826 --> 36:48.059
Help! Help!

36:52.831 --> 36:54.766
No, please...

37:01.073 --> 37:02.440
Dad!

37:04.209 --> 37:05.710
Help!

37:05.712 --> 37:07.345
Kate! Whoa!

37:07.347 --> 37:08.180
Help!

37:08.182 --> 37:10.081
- Okay, she-nans!
- It's chanan.

37:10.083 --> 37:11.315
Okay, chanans!

37:11.317 --> 37:12.950
No, it's a long "n". It's "chanaan".

37:12.952 --> 37:14.786
Whatever.

37:14.788 --> 37:16.254
Professor, you go right.

37:16.256 --> 37:17.689
Jacob, go left.

37:17.691 --> 37:18.890
We're coming, honey!

37:18.892 --> 37:20.458
All right, you sons of bitches.

37:24.264 --> 37:26.097
You want to go? You got it.

38:03.869 --> 38:05.436
Whew!

38:08.941 --> 38:11.008
Sayonara.

38:17.282 --> 38:19.150
Dad.

38:19.152 --> 38:20.485
Kate, I'm sorry, honey.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.155
Did you guys see that?

38:24.157 --> 38:26.390
They tried to sacrifice her.

38:26.392 --> 38:28.025
Even after all these years,

38:28.027 --> 38:30.228
they're still practicing their rituals.

38:30.230 --> 38:33.030
That's fascinating, Spock.
Let's just get out of here.

38:33.032 --> 38:34.332
You all right?

38:35.935 --> 38:38.136
Aw, shit!

38:47.780 --> 38:49.347
What do we do?!

38:52.351 --> 38:54.218
Barbecue's about to start.

38:54.220 --> 38:57.054
It's chanan-stop action.

39:02.161 --> 39:04.796
There's a passageway...
Just beyond the altar.

39:04.798 --> 39:06.831
Move, God damn it! Go!

39:08.433 --> 39:10.434
Go! Get your brother! Frost!

39:10.436 --> 39:11.903
Go, God damn it!

39:11.905 --> 39:14.806
Come on!

39:29.488 --> 39:32.824
You are so much more than him, Richard.

39:32.826 --> 39:34.826
You never stole just for the money,

39:34.828 --> 39:37.161
and you always sought greatness.

39:39.164 --> 39:41.199
Look where it got me.

39:42.935 --> 39:45.837
Just ask. You don't have to beg for it.

39:45.839 --> 39:47.238
Just ask, Richard.

39:50.210 --> 39:51.976
I can't.

39:53.111 --> 39:54.512
I can't leave Seth.

39:56.348 --> 39:59.250
I'm all he's got.

39:59.252 --> 40:01.385
He's lost without me.

40:01.387 --> 40:03.487
Then he can come with us.

40:03.489 --> 40:05.990
It'll never happen.

40:05.992 --> 40:08.426
If this trip to Mexico has proved anything,

40:08.428 --> 40:12.129
it's that he's always
got to call the shots.

40:12.131 --> 40:13.865
Then you have to let him go.

40:13.867 --> 40:18.269
You've been held captive
by his desires for too long.

40:18.271 --> 40:22.106
You're a prisoner, Richard... Just like me.

40:22.108 --> 40:25.343
Let me set you free.

40:29.882 --> 40:32.216
What's gonna happen to me?

40:34.286 --> 40:38.289
You'll become more than you ever were...

40:38.291 --> 40:40.558
Beyond fire and water...

40:40.560 --> 40:44.428
Beyond light and dark...

40:44.430 --> 40:47.231
Beyond dusk and dawn.
