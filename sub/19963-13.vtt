00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:04.205 --> 00:06.705
(theme song playing)

00:08.943 --> 00:12.378
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.446
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.448 --> 00:19.785
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:19.787 --> 00:22.721
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:22.723 --> 00:27.659
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:27.661 --> 00:30.796
<i>¶ And I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:35.367
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:46.313 --> 00:47.746
(cawing)

00:51.919 --> 00:53.652
King Frederic:
Rapunzel!

00:53.654 --> 00:56.422
Rapunzel, which of these
should we mount
in the main hall?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.090
This one says,
"Hhe's all business,"

00:58.092 --> 01:02.261
whereas this one
I feel says, "Stern
yet approachable."

01:02.263 --> 01:03.662
What do you think?

01:03.664 --> 01:04.830
(wind blowing)

01:06.367 --> 01:07.800
Hmm...

01:24.852 --> 01:28.253
Captain:
You'd like to tighten security
for the Princess, your Majesty?

01:28.255 --> 01:30.522
Discreetly tighten, Captain?

01:30.524 --> 01:33.392
Though she is
keeping her promise to stay
within the walls of Corona,

01:33.394 --> 01:38.464
I fear Rapunzel
has been demonstrating a knack
for getting into trouble.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.208
(squeaking)

01:52.813 --> 01:55.481
A world
travel guide. Ooh!

01:57.284 --> 01:59.551
Soon, Pascal. (gasp)

02:03.824 --> 02:04.890
(squeaks)

02:07.161 --> 02:09.895
Uh-oh, Pascal,
it looks like rain.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.298
-(crow caws)
-Guard: Hey! (grunts)

02:13.300 --> 02:15.300
-Aah!
-(splash)

02:16.270 --> 02:17.436
(guard moans)

02:17.438 --> 02:18.403
My back!

02:18.405 --> 02:20.472
(ducks quacking)

02:22.977 --> 02:24.243
(Rapunzel gasps)

02:24.245 --> 02:25.410
(quacks)

02:25.412 --> 02:29.047
Is it me or are the guards
following us everywhere?

02:31.152 --> 02:33.785
What do you say
we don't make it
so easy for them?

02:33.787 --> 02:35.120
(pascal squeaks)

02:35.122 --> 02:36.188
(gasps)

02:39.927 --> 02:42.427
Uh, Captain,
she went that way.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.367
(sighs)

02:48.369 --> 02:49.768
Mmmm...

02:51.138 --> 02:52.938
Hey! There she goes!

02:52.940 --> 02:54.306
Bye!

02:54.308 --> 02:56.208
(laughs)

02:56.210 --> 02:57.543
(sighs)

02:57.545 --> 02:59.478
The King's not going
to like this.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.546
(duck quacks)

03:00.548 --> 03:02.147
(crack of thunder)

03:02.149 --> 03:03.782
We showed them, huh?

03:03.784 --> 03:06.818
But now there's
a slight chance
we'll get stuck in the rain.

03:06.820 --> 03:07.986
(crack of thunder)

03:07.988 --> 03:09.788
Okay, yeah, a huge chance.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.456
(rain pattering)

03:12.493 --> 03:14.293
(thunder booms)

03:17.798 --> 03:21.533
It was a dark and stormy night.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.804
And as I stood there
before this decrepit
old mansion,

03:25.806 --> 03:29.708
the door slowly
creaked open.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.679
-(body thuds)
-Out stepped
a ghastly figure,

03:33.681 --> 03:37.482
an old woman
with cold, dead eyes.

03:37.484 --> 03:41.086
Hair like tumbleweeds
stapled to her head,

03:41.088 --> 03:44.890
and teeth that looked
as if they could grind bone.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.158
(thunder crash)

03:46.160 --> 03:47.226
(thugs gasp)

03:48.829 --> 03:51.763
Ooh! Are you telling
ghost stories?

03:51.765 --> 03:55.601
Nah, Big Nose here
was just tellin' us
about his date last week.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.936
Ahh, sweet, sweet Rhonda.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.505
So what are you doing out
in this lousy weather, Rapunzel?

04:00.507 --> 04:04.943
Good question.
I thought my dad was done
being overprotective,

04:04.945 --> 04:09.381
but for some reason,
it seemed like guards were
following me everywhere today.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.783
Come on, Raps,
this is Corona!

04:11.785 --> 04:14.052
Guards are like cockroaches
in this kingdom.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.622
Hook Foot's right.
No one's following you.

04:16.624 --> 04:20.926
This storm has just put everyone
ill at ease, and you're
probably-- you're just

04:20.928 --> 04:22.194
imagining things.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.295
(thunder crash)

04:23.297 --> 04:24.396
Oh, hello, fellas.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.597
Thugs:
He did it!

04:25.599 --> 04:28.867
I was just wandering by
and-- Princess?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.769
What a surprise
to find you here.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.639
Uh-huh. Hi... Captain.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.907
Huh! Funny seeing you here.

04:35.909 --> 04:39.444
Funny?
Why there-- there's nothin'
funny about it.

04:39.446 --> 04:44.283
I come here all the time
to... shoot the breeze
with my old chums,

04:44.285 --> 04:48.287
Hook Toes, Hornswoggle
and... that guy.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.555
Ha-- Isn't that right, fellas?

04:51.992 --> 04:55.093
Yep, nothin' I love more
than wettin' my old whistle

04:55.095 --> 04:57.062
at the ol' Cozy Quacker.

04:59.099 --> 05:03.402
Specialty of the house... slop.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.803
(squeaks)

05:04.805 --> 05:05.837
Mmph.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.639
(squeaks)

05:07.641 --> 05:08.740
(squeaks)

05:08.742 --> 05:10.609
Well, this has been
fun, Princess.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.278
Uhh, let's say I escort you
back to the castle.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.746
(thunder crash)

05:14.748 --> 05:16.515
No one's goin' anywhere.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.685
The roads are all flooded.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.119
(thunder cracks)

05:21.121 --> 05:24.456
Fantastic.
We'll just have
to wait out the storm.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.459
And by the way,
it's absolutely freezing
in here.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.095
Don't you people know
how to keep a fire goin'?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.130
-No!
-That's off limits!

05:32.132 --> 05:33.465
Don't touch that!

05:33.467 --> 05:36.501
-(wind howls)
-(dramatic music plays)

05:43.310 --> 05:45.477
That club
is never to be disturbed.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.713
(scoffs)
Why?

05:47.715 --> 05:48.714
What's so special
about it?

05:48.716 --> 05:52.551
Not special.
More like spooky.

05:52.553 --> 05:58.290
It belonged to the Duckling's
original owner, Ruthless Ruth.

05:58.292 --> 06:01.593
(ghostly laughter)

06:05.866 --> 06:10.302
Ruth was the meanest Pub Thug
to ever live.

06:10.304 --> 06:14.673
She used that club
to intimidate her customers.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.042
They called it
her Listen Up Club,

06:17.044 --> 06:19.878
and legend has it
that whoever disturbs it

06:19.880 --> 06:23.749
will incur the wrath
of Ruthless Ruth's wraith!

06:23.751 --> 06:25.917
(thunder cracks)

06:25.919 --> 06:29.087
The wrath
of Ruthless Ruth's wraith?

06:29.089 --> 06:31.156
(thunder crashes)

06:31.158 --> 06:34.893
-The wrath
of Ruthless Ruth's wraith!
-(thunder crashes)

06:34.895 --> 06:39.364
Could everyone
just stop saying, "The wrath
of Ruthless Ruth's wraith"!

06:39.366 --> 06:40.766
(rain pattering)

06:42.336 --> 06:44.703
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:44.705 --> 06:48.373
I'd rather take my chances
out in the rain than spend
one more minute listening

06:48.375 --> 06:50.742
to you buffoons
and your silly ghost story!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.310
(thunder crashes)

06:56.283 --> 06:59.117
-(thugs yelling)
-Vlad: Whoa! Let's get
outta here!

07:00.754 --> 07:02.788
(grunt)
It's stuck!

07:02.790 --> 07:04.689
Aaah!
We're trapped in the pub!

07:04.691 --> 07:07.225
It's the wrath
of Ruthless Ruth!

07:07.227 --> 07:09.628
Attila: This is all
your fault, Captain.

07:09.630 --> 07:15.100
Oh, please.
You don't honestly think
Ruthless Ruth is behind this?

07:15.102 --> 07:19.404
Guys, he's right.
Let's not overreact.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.207
Just because the lights
went out, the shutters
slammed shut,

07:22.209 --> 07:23.875
and the doors got stuck
all on their own,

07:23.877 --> 07:26.311
doesn't necessarily mean
there's a...

07:26.313 --> 07:29.548
(sinister cackling)

07:29.550 --> 07:30.916
ghost.

07:30.918 --> 07:34.219
Wait, where's Shorty?

07:34.221 --> 07:38.657
(ghostly)
You have disturbed
my slumber!

07:38.659 --> 07:43.829
If you don't listen up
and note my words by dawn,

07:43.831 --> 07:50.068
you will all be trapped in here
with me forever!

07:53.841 --> 07:57.843
Shorty! Ruth!
Who-- Whoever you are,
what do you want?

07:57.845 --> 08:01.146
-I want...
-All: Yes?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.748
-I want...
-All:
Yes?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.654
A sardine sammy
and a jug of pickle brine.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.690
Enough of this nonsense!

08:12.659 --> 08:14.793
Captain?
Didn't you hear?

08:14.795 --> 08:18.163
He says we have until dawn
to figure out what Ruth wants

08:18.165 --> 08:20.632
or else we're gonna be
trapped in here forever.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.867
You're gonna listen to him?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.802
You realize he eats cheese
off the floor?

08:23.804 --> 08:28.707
One man's floor
is another man's plate. Clink.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.543
The priority is to get
the Princess out of this pub

08:31.545 --> 08:33.345
and back to the castle
as quickly as possible.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.479
(hitting door)

08:34.481 --> 08:37.148
Is there anything we can use
as a battering ram?

08:37.150 --> 08:39.784
A battering ram
isn't the answer.

08:39.786 --> 08:43.722
We need
to know more about Ruth
and the Listen Up Club.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.492
Well, they say that she lived
to terrify those around her.

08:47.494 --> 08:52.831
And-- and legend has it
that people's screams
were music to her ears.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.801
And she-- she would go
on terrible rampages,
storming through the streets

08:56.803 --> 08:59.037
-of Corona.
-No one knew
when she would strike.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.573
All they knew was
she would disappear
from the pub,

09:01.575 --> 09:03.642
and when she did,
no man, beast,

09:03.644 --> 09:05.410
or building foundation
was safe

09:05.412 --> 09:07.846
from the swing
of her fearsome club.

09:07.848 --> 09:11.917
Afterwards, she'd come back
to the pub, and etch a notch
in her club

09:11.919 --> 09:15.587
for every unlucky creature
she'd destroyed in her path.

09:15.589 --> 09:19.658
Then she'd have dinner,
a bowl of putrid, slimy slugs.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.326
I heard it was hairy spiders.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.828
I heard it was both!
And she ate them alive!

09:23.830 --> 09:27.165
-And she didn't chew!
-She had horrible
table manners.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.735
Yeah.
An-- and they say all
of Corona lived in fear

09:30.737 --> 09:35.173
of the mighty barbarian
until the day she died.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.075
And the only way
to appease her

09:37.077 --> 09:40.579
is to figure out
how to "listen up."

09:40.581 --> 09:42.781
Or we're gonna be
stuck here forever.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.749
I don't wanna be
stuck here forever.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.885
There's only one slice
of pie left!

09:46.887 --> 09:49.888
(violin music playing)

09:49.890 --> 09:52.591
Cut it out!
Pie's important to me, okay?

09:52.593 --> 09:57.462
(violin music continues)

09:57.464 --> 09:58.997
Um... guys?

10:01.568 --> 10:05.337
(instruments start playing)

10:06.907 --> 10:09.074
We've gotta get outta here, now!

10:09.076 --> 10:11.242
-(running footsteps)
-(crash)

10:11.244 --> 10:13.612
-(crash)
-Again, on three!

10:13.614 --> 10:16.114
Ruth, please.
All we're trying to do

10:16.116 --> 10:17.916
is figure out what you want.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.217
(piano hitting floor)

10:20.821 --> 10:23.989
(ghostly voice)
Listen up, Rapunzel.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.223
Who said that?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.492
(ghostly voice)
Listen... up.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.167
Wow!
Look at this.

10:36.169 --> 10:40.071
-(tuning fork struck)
-And the club's hook.
(gasp) It's a tuning fork.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.906
(thunder crashes)

10:41.908 --> 10:47.078
(sinister laughing)

10:48.915 --> 10:53.084
Princess! Listen,
and listen to me
well, spirit!

10:53.086 --> 10:56.988
Uh, Cap, not so sure
you wanna take that tone
with the undead.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.258
No more games!
Under the authority
of King Frederic

11:00.260 --> 11:04.996
of Corona, I demand
you release us or face
the consequences!

11:04.998 --> 11:08.266
-(thunder crashes)
-(sinister laughing)

11:10.537 --> 11:12.871
(rain pattering)

11:12.873 --> 11:15.607
Your Majesty,
we've evacuated
the East Bank.

11:15.609 --> 11:18.009
While the flooding caused
some damage,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.978
there have been no reports
of injuries.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.080
And still no word from...?

11:25.952 --> 11:27.619
Your Majesty.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.424
(rain pattering)

11:34.961 --> 11:37.479
(squeaking)

11:37.480 --> 11:39.998
(sigh)
We are running out of time.
Okay, let's think.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.733
What do we have to go on?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.903
The Listen Up Club
and this tuning fork.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.905
(tuning fork sounds)

12:10.430 --> 12:13.765
Don't worry, Princess!
We're gonna you get outta here!

12:13.767 --> 12:18.036
One... two... three!

12:18.038 --> 12:20.105
-(crash)
-(table thuds)

12:20.107 --> 12:23.007
Attila:
We're free!
I'm gonna travel the world!

12:23.009 --> 12:25.744
I'm gonna exercise every day!

12:40.193 --> 12:43.094
What in the world
is goin' on?

12:48.535 --> 12:52.937
Oh, come on!
Why didn't anybody tell me
my pants were split?

12:52.939 --> 12:55.140
I thought we were pals.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.142
Attila:
Let's try
the trap door.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.278
Aaah!

13:00.280 --> 13:01.479
Attila:
We're free!

13:01.481 --> 13:03.148
I'm gonna exercise sometimes...

13:03.150 --> 13:04.949
Waa-ohh!

13:04.951 --> 13:06.818
-Ohh!
-(thud)

13:06.820 --> 13:09.220
We're never getting out of here!

13:12.993 --> 13:15.994
Um, Ruth?
Are you in here?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.865
(tuning forks sounding)

13:28.909 --> 13:31.042
(tuning forks humming)

13:33.580 --> 13:34.813
Aah!

13:43.089 --> 13:46.090
Ruth...
I-- I-- I want to help--

13:46.092 --> 13:48.193
(ghostly voice)
Listen up!

13:48.195 --> 13:50.495
Ruth:
The legend is wrong, Rapunzel.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.831
We all have dreams.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.601
All I wanted was for them
to hear my song.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.803
So you weren't a barbarian?

13:58.805 --> 14:01.306
Oh no, I was a barbarian,

14:01.308 --> 14:04.275
but I never disappeared
to go on rampages.

14:04.277 --> 14:08.646
I was just hiding away
in here, practicing my music.

14:08.648 --> 14:13.051
My only dream was to write
a rabble-rousing chantey,

14:13.053 --> 14:16.654
(singing)
and hear it sung aloud
at the pub.

14:16.656 --> 14:21.326
Oh, but-- but I was afraid
no one would listen.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.795
"Listen Up" means
listen to your song.

14:23.797 --> 14:27.398
It ain't just a club, Rapunzel.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.101
-Aah!
-(smash)

14:33.240 --> 14:35.406
(yelling)

14:35.408 --> 14:37.141
Ooh!

14:38.912 --> 14:41.246
Rapunzel:
They're musical notes!

14:41.248 --> 14:43.882
Guys!
Ruth wasn't as bad
as we thought!

14:43.884 --> 14:48.152
-Whoa!
-Oh! And this isn't just a club.
It's her secret song,

14:48.154 --> 14:49.888
but she was too afraid
to share it.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.857
And now we all have to play it.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.158
-What?
-Attila: Say what?

14:54.160 --> 14:57.395
Here, here. Hold this
so I can read the music.

14:57.397 --> 15:02.533
(piano music playing)

15:02.535 --> 15:04.168
Aah!

15:10.343 --> 15:12.744
Guys, I think she likes it!

15:12.746 --> 15:14.512
We're gonna be free!

15:14.514 --> 15:17.849
(piano music continues)

15:17.851 --> 15:19.350
(grunting)

15:19.352 --> 15:21.853
(grunting)

15:21.855 --> 15:23.254
Whoaaa!

15:23.256 --> 15:26.324
(squeaking)

15:29.729 --> 15:30.995
(honks)

15:43.576 --> 15:44.809
(snap)

15:44.811 --> 15:45.910
(grunt)

15:45.912 --> 15:47.078
No!

15:47.080 --> 15:48.146
Take that, Ruth!

15:49.316 --> 15:53.584
Now I'll never have the chance
for my song to be heard!

15:53.586 --> 15:57.622
And none of you
will ever see the light
of day again!

16:05.131 --> 16:06.831
What are you doing, Captain?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.334
You don't stop an evil ghost
with a song.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.902
You stop it with force!

16:10.904 --> 16:13.338
Didn't you hear her?
Ruth's not evil.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.239
The club was just her song.

16:15.241 --> 16:18.576
Well, I-- I did have
a moose on my head.

16:18.578 --> 16:23.414
Captain, having someone
play her song was Ruth's dream.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.184
Ohh. Sorry.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.654
-(thunder crashes)
-Ruth: You've crushed
my dreams,

16:29.656 --> 16:32.323
and now I'll crush you!

16:32.325 --> 16:37.128
None of you will ever
see the light of day again!

16:37.130 --> 16:38.196
(squeak)

16:38.198 --> 16:39.864
(all gasp)

16:39.866 --> 16:41.366
Aaah!

16:42.802 --> 16:47.338
(sounds of panic)

16:47.340 --> 16:48.239
Aaah!

16:51.878 --> 16:53.444
Aaaah-- Oooh.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.545
-Attila: Hide!
-Aah!

16:54.547 --> 16:55.947
Attila:
Come in closer!

16:55.949 --> 16:57.115
Not that close.

17:02.956 --> 17:06.157
(thugs groaning)

17:06.159 --> 17:10.194
Ruth! It's not dawn yet!
We can still finish your song.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.529
No, we can't!

17:11.531 --> 17:15.199
That hothead with the misplaced
eyebrow burned my music!

17:15.201 --> 17:17.368
The new day is nearly upon us,

17:17.370 --> 17:20.371
and I'll be relegated back
to the depths of my chamber!

17:20.373 --> 17:24.308
No, Ruth, no, the club
was just a piece of wood.

17:24.310 --> 17:28.513
The song is your dream,
and you can't burn a dream.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.516
The song must still
be in your heart.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.886
But... I can't do this alone.

17:34.888 --> 17:38.556
Ruth, only you are in charge
of your own destiny.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.891
And we're here to help.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.895
You-- you really think
I should sing it?

17:43.897 --> 17:47.999
Face your fear,
and let your true self shine.

17:48.001 --> 17:53.337
(piano music playing)

17:53.339 --> 17:58.176
¶ Since I was a lassie,
Just a sweet young thing ¶

17:58.178 --> 18:02.580
¶ All I truly longed to do
was make up songs to sing ¶

18:02.582 --> 18:07.385
¶ Sure, my voice was rotten
and had a pity twang ¶

18:07.387 --> 18:13.624
¶ But I had dreams
and in my dreams
this is what I sang ¶

18:15.295 --> 18:19.597
¶ Listen up, all you goons,
listen up and hear my tunes ¶

18:19.599 --> 18:23.468
¶ Every line, boys, is mine
so listen up ¶

18:23.470 --> 18:26.204
Catchy! (giggles)

18:26.206 --> 18:30.074
¶ How I yearned to sing it,
still I was afraid ¶

18:30.076 --> 18:33.945
¶ Guess I feared
they'd call me weird
and mock the songs I made ¶

18:33.947 --> 18:37.748
¶ So I shut my piehole
and hid my work away ¶

18:37.750 --> 18:41.752
-¶ But you had dreams ¶
-¶ And in my dreams
this is what I'd play ¶

18:41.754 --> 18:45.323
¶ Listen up, if you please,
listen to my melodies ¶

18:45.325 --> 18:49.827
-¶ Folks, she wrote every note ¶
-¶ So listen up ¶

18:49.829 --> 18:53.831
¶ I kept my song a secret,
but carved it on this club ¶

18:53.833 --> 18:57.802
¶ Waiting till
the perfect moment came ¶

18:57.804 --> 19:02.306
¶ At last I worked the nerve up
and stood before the pub ¶

19:02.308 --> 19:06.577
¶ I let one note
come through my throat ¶

19:06.579 --> 19:12.016
¶ And then I died of shame ¶

19:12.018 --> 19:13.417
-Died?
-Died?

19:13.419 --> 19:14.652
Ruth:
¶ Dead! ¶

19:14.654 --> 19:18.656
¶ And now I haunt this tavern
suffering for my art ¶

19:18.658 --> 19:20.591
¶ Years and years
of doubts and fears ¶

19:20.593 --> 19:22.527
¶ It's time to heed your heart ¶

19:22.529 --> 19:26.464
¶ I can end this curse now
if I can end this song ¶

19:26.466 --> 19:32.837
-¶ Like in your dreams ¶
-¶ But in my dreams,
you all must sing along ¶

19:35.875 --> 19:40.044
¶ Listen up, all you thugs,
lift your voices and your mugs ¶

19:40.046 --> 19:41.879
¶ Don't be shy,
let it fly ¶

19:41.881 --> 19:43.681
-¶ Listen up ¶
-That's it!

19:43.683 --> 19:45.716
-¶ Listen up ¶
-Attila: ¶ Listen here ¶

19:45.718 --> 19:47.818
-¶ Raise the roof ¶
-¶ And rock the house ¶

19:47.820 --> 19:50.521
¶ Make it loud,
sing it proud, listen-- ¶

19:50.523 --> 19:52.123
-Wait!
-What's wrong?

19:53.359 --> 19:54.392
(angrily) Him!

19:54.394 --> 19:57.395
Rapunzel: Come on!
Everyone needs to sing!

19:57.397 --> 19:59.797
I-- I haven't sung
in quite some time.

19:59.799 --> 20:03.067
-What if I'm Rusty?
-Your name's not Rusty,
it's Captain.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.635
And I'm Susan.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.706
Captain, please!
It's almost midnight.
We have to free Ruth!

20:10.076 --> 20:12.577
¶ Listen up,
listen close ¶

20:12.579 --> 20:14.512
¶ You're disgusting,
old and gross ¶

20:14.514 --> 20:19.150
-¶ But your song
is quite strong ¶
-All: ¶ Listen up ¶

20:19.152 --> 20:22.553
¶ Listen up, listen up,
everybody raise your cup ¶

20:22.555 --> 20:25.756
¶ Here's to Ruth,
that's the truth,
listen up ¶

20:25.758 --> 20:26.857
¶ Listen up ¶

20:26.859 --> 20:28.559
-¶ Listen up ¶
-¶ Listen up ¶

20:28.561 --> 20:31.329
¶ Listen up ¶

20:31.331 --> 20:32.830
¶ Hey! Yeah ¶

20:32.832 --> 20:34.565
(laughter and cheers)

20:34.567 --> 20:36.400
-Rapunzel: That's great.
-Big Nose: Hey, hey!

20:38.371 --> 20:42.240
(bird singing)

20:43.610 --> 20:47.511
Ruth, wait!
You've been here
for so many years.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.747
Why wait until now
to free yourself,

20:49.749 --> 20:51.449
and why reach out to me?

20:51.451 --> 20:54.852
Because I knew
you'd understand, Rapunzel.

20:56.222 --> 20:59.890
By the way, when it comes
to making dreams happen,

20:59.892 --> 21:02.793
you might wanna
take your own advice.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.931
(laughs)

21:06.933 --> 21:08.566
-So long, ghost.
-Attila: Bye, Ruth.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.901
Say hi to my Uncle Murray
for me!

21:10.903 --> 21:14.472
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I thought Ruth was a goat.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.775
Princess?
Are you ready to return
to the castle?

21:17.777 --> 21:21.312
-(chuckles) I know I am.
-Rapunzel: I am so ready.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.485
Ruth reminded me of something
very important, Pascal.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.821
No one is just gonna hand me
my dreams.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.556
I have to go get them myself.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.326
And I know Dad's heart
is in the right place

21:35.328 --> 21:37.495
with sending all the guards
to protect me,

21:37.497 --> 21:40.698
but it's time I put him in...

21:43.069 --> 21:47.471
Rapunzel!
You have no idea
how worried I was.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.606
I love you so much, darling.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.409
You mean everything to me.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.643
Dad?

21:54.747 --> 21:57.515
(sighs) I love you, too.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.695
(theme music playing)

22:10.697 --> 22:13.597
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.599 --> 22:16.267
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:16.269 --> 22:18.436
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.438 --> 22:20.304
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.306 --> 22:23.140
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:23.142 --> 22:25.643
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.645 --> 22:28.979
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.981 --> 22:31.415
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> more of me to give ¶</i>

22:32.518 --> 22:33.984
<i> ¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

22:33.986 --> 22:36.554
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
