02:49.625 --> 02:51.125
the quick thing,

is to assume that everything
you've dragged to shore is a fish.

02:56.958 --> 02:59.416

that's the prudent mindset

02:59.500 --> 03:00.916

But I take a more nuanced view.

03:07.458 --> 03:08.458
I try.

03:12.625 --> 03:13.833
So here's what we'll do, Bix.

03:13.916 --> 03:15.333
I'll tell you everything I know,

03:15.416 --> 03:19.583
and in doing so, perhaps convince you
to cooperate without intervention.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.000
Failing that,

03:22.416 --> 03:23.666
we have Dr. Gorst,

03:25.083 --> 03:28.791
who's developed a unique interview system
some of us are very excited about.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.916
As you now know,
we brought in Salman Paak last night.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.041
We tracked him
to a radio hidden in his yard

03:34.125 --> 03:36.583
and thought he might cooperate
without encouragement.

03:36.666 --> 03:40.458
For a man with very little actual
rebellious activity on his resume,

03:40.541 --> 03:42.041
he was remarkably resistant,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.833
which of course just makes us think
there's more to be learned.

03:45.916 --> 03:48.458
Which leads to a longer session.

03:48.541 --> 03:50.208

We learned everything we needed to know,

04:01.791 --> 04:05.791
and quite frankly,
it hardly seems worth the price he's paid.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.958
Paak attended a separatist meeting
two years ago in Jondora

04:10.041 --> 04:13.125
where he met a woman who said
that if he was serious about politics,

04:13.208 --> 04:16.583
he might like to act as liaison
for Ferrix when he returned home.

04:16.666 --> 04:21.291
He was sent the fractal radio unit
you used yesterday afternoon.

04:22.666 --> 04:26.041
Now this unknown woman
who recruited him to the cause

04:26.125 --> 04:29.250
seemed less interested
in generating political activity on Ferrix

04:29.333 --> 04:33.000
than she was in using
your planet's unique commercial position

04:33.083 --> 04:35.250

He swears he didn't.
He thought he'd get away.

35:49.958 --> 35:51.833
This was a Dr. Gorst interview?

35:51.916 --> 35:53.333
Yes, sir. Confidence is high.

He got the pilot
talking almost immediately.

he used is one of the items stolen

36:00.666 --> 36:02.125
Apologies. We were offsite.

36:02.208 --> 36:03.750
We've got a rebel pilot in custody.

36:03.833 --> 36:05.208
One of Anto Kreegyr's group.

36:05.291 --> 36:07.000
He was picked up at a customs check.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.291
We don't think Kreegyr knows
he's gone missing yet.

36:09.375 --> 36:12.833
He's telling us there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.

36:12.916 --> 36:13.958
Where was he heading?

36:14.041 --> 36:16.416
-On his way to Kafrene.
-They'll count him missing soon.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.583
Exactly. We don't want
Kreegyr getting spooked.

36:18.666 --> 36:20.333
We can't hang on to him.
We can't let him go.

36:20.416 --> 36:22.208
Destroy the ship.
Make it look like an accident.

36:22.291 --> 36:24.583
There's too much at stake.
If I were Kreegyr, I'd be suspicious.

36:24.666 --> 36:26.166
PARTAGAZ: We want Kreegyr moving forward.

36:26.333 --> 36:27.666
What if we foul the ship?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.416
An accident. Something mechanical.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.083
Have the pilot found dead in the cockpit.
What would happen?

36:32.166 --> 36:35.041
They'd have to find it.
But they'd tow it into Kafrene.

36:35.125 --> 36:38.583
If we did it quickly, staged it properly,
let it drift into traffic.

36:38.666 --> 36:41.791
Make it so. Top priority.
Quickly and carefully.

36:41.875 --> 36:43.250
We leave no trace.

36:43.333 --> 36:44.500
