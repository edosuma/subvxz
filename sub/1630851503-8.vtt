WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:07.575
We've got a lot more
broken ornaments than usual.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.677
I guess you're gonna blame
my kid for that.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.246
Uh, Becky, what does she
call these?

00:12.280 --> 00:14.382
Baseballs?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.818
Don't you worry.
I got us covered.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.254
In the summer?
Fishing lures.

00:20.288 --> 00:24.092
In December?
Christmas ornaments.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.095
Guess what? This year,
we don't have to dodge cars

00:27.128 --> 00:29.730
or run onto the highway median
to cut down a tree.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.999
I got us one already.
It's a beauty!

00:32.032 --> 00:33.534
Becky,
come give me a hand.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.403
Oh, no dodging cars,
huh?

00:35.436 --> 00:37.338
I'm gonna miss
looking at our tree

00:37.371 --> 00:40.241
and thinking how lucky we are
to be alive.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.511
It's a beer can
Christmas tree.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.046
Just when you think our trash
can't get any whiter.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.782
One of the liquor distributors
at The Lunch Box

00:48.816 --> 00:50.618
gave it to us
as a promotional item.

00:50.651 --> 00:54.388
It was either this or "Rudolph
the Rum-Nosed Reindeer".

00:54.422 --> 00:58.392
Lights the way with his nose,
but he shouldn't be on the road.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.794
Nice tree.

01:00.828 --> 01:01.929
When most people
are worried

01:01.962 --> 01:03.564
about Christmas becoming
too commercial,

01:03.597 --> 01:05.633
the Conners are going
the other way.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.601
Crap.
Did we have plans for today?

01:07.635 --> 01:09.537
'Cause I can ditch these people
in a hot minute.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.639
No, no. I-I just came by
to tell you

01:11.672 --> 01:13.641
that I had a really great time
last night.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.144
I also brought breakfast
for everybody.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.813
For everybody? I assume you mean
it's not vegan.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.149
Oh.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.752
An in-person thank you
<i>and</i> breakfast?

01:24.785 --> 01:27.155
Well, somebody
gave it up quick.

01:27.188 --> 01:30.591
Uh, relax, you old horn dog.
Nobody gave anything up.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.493
It was just a nice night
at the theater.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.328
We've been going out
a couple weeks,

01:34.362 --> 01:37.064
and I thought it was time
for it to be my turn to treat,

01:37.097 --> 01:38.932
so I got us
a couple tickets

01:38.966 --> 01:41.835
to Lanford High's production
of "Hamilton."

01:41.869 --> 01:44.272
Ha!
What kind of cheap-ass places

01:44.305 --> 01:46.807
did you take her to
to deserve that?

01:46.840 --> 01:49.076
I-I loved it,
especially when a rubber band

01:49.109 --> 01:52.012
shot off of Hamilton's braces
and into Aaron Burr's eye.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.847
It really made the duel
about something.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.150
I'm just impressed
that Nick

01:56.184 --> 01:58.186
came all the way over here
to thank you.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.488
Actually, I-I came over
'cause I don't have a cellphone.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.023
Dropped it in the crapper,
huh?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.426
Happens to the best of us.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.128
You just gotta glove up
and go fishing.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.431
Uh, no.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.166
Nick gave up his phone
a while ago.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.803
He was a stockbroker, and the
phone represented stress 24/7.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.505
Yeah, phones suck
all of your energy.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.440
They keep you from living
your life in the present.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.008
I have no energy
and no life,

02:21.041 --> 02:23.043
so it's really not a problem
for me.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.614
So, Nick,
you don't have a phone.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.681
That's really interesting.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.049
How do people get
in touch with you?

02:29.082 --> 02:30.551
They leave me messages
at the bookstore.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.520
So, what, you're just
anti-technology?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.822
No. Not at all.
I have an electric car.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.023
Ha. In case
you haven't heard,

02:36.056 --> 02:38.959
they got ones
that run on gas now.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.329
I guess it's gonna be
up to us old-timers

02:41.362 --> 02:45.499
to finish putting that hole
in the ozone by ourselves.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.534
Well, it'll give you
something to do

02:46.567 --> 02:47.635
until the melanoma
gets ya.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.036
Anyway,
I gotta get going.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.004
Uh, hey, why don't you,
uh, swing by

02:51.038 --> 02:52.906
after you're done with work
and say hi?
Sure.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.008
Hey, how about she drives
all the way over there

02:55.042 --> 02:56.377
and she can hand you
an emoji

02:56.410 --> 02:59.447
that lets you know
how she's feeling?

03:03.284 --> 03:07.521
So, Nick
doesn't have a phone.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.490
How very convenient.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.924
Don't start.
I'm not.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.894
I'm just wondering if he's
really trying to avoid stress

03:13.927 --> 03:16.430
or he just doesn't
want you to know where he is.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.932
Sure, i-it's a little weird,
and -- and, yeah,

03:18.966 --> 03:21.001
maybe it's been
kind of inconvenient,

03:21.034 --> 03:23.003
but when we're together,
he's totally present.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.240
What if he's also present
with his other girlfriend

03:26.274 --> 03:29.042
or girlfriends or wife?

03:29.076 --> 03:31.011
Guy's got
an electric car.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.748
Obviously, he's looking
for action.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.252
I have no idea
what that means.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.554
Dad, you're a good judge
of character.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.390
You don't think anything's
going on, right?

03:42.423 --> 03:45.459
I-I like the guy, but he's
not living in a commune.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.861
He's got a job.
He's got a kid.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.732
Emergencies come up.
I don't get it.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.268
Okay, so I'm dating a guy
with a secret family,

03:54.302 --> 03:56.637
but I'm getting to the age where
guys are gonna have baggage.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.072
Darlene.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.276
Okay, fine. I-It bugs me.
I-I'll talk to him.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.746
Or you sit in your car
outside of his house,

04:05.779 --> 04:08.115
one house down, but on the other
side of the street.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.919
Leave your rain lights on, and
don't forget to bring a pee jar.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.055
'Cause those motion-sensor
lights outside people's garages,

04:15.088 --> 04:16.657
they will light you up

04:16.690 --> 04:20.428
like Liza Minnelli
taking a leak on Broadway.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.099
-- <i>Captions by VITAC</i> --

04:59.367 --> 05:01.802
Make sure you get everything
out of these drawers.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.004
I don't want to accidentally
give away something of value

05:04.037 --> 05:05.473
at the garage sale.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.775
I found 11 cents
and a candy bar wrapper.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.310
You want me to put this
in the safe?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.381
I still don't get why
Louise is making you

05:13.414 --> 05:14.682
get rid of
this bedroom set.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.817
I mean, it's old,
but it looks fine to me.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.887
I don't want to get rid of it,
either.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.524
I'd rather just use Louise's
furniture and save this stuff,

05:23.557 --> 05:25.859
but she wants new stuff
that's ours.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.961
Hey, start off
making her happy.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.398
Then you've got
someplace to go.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.666
Sure.
The problem is,

05:32.700 --> 05:35.503
I gotta pay for it
'cause she paid for the wedding.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.838
I don't have the money,
so I gotta sell all this stuff,

05:37.871 --> 05:39.740
and it's too bad 'cause...

05:39.773 --> 05:41.975
they don't make furniture
like this anymore.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.177
You mean by savaging
old-growth forests

05:44.211 --> 05:47.881
and pouring the excess varnish
into our drinking water?

05:47.915 --> 05:49.383
It was a different time,

05:49.417 --> 05:52.886
and you don't remember what
water used to taste like anyway.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.723
This was the first new furniture
your mom and dad ever bought.

05:55.756 --> 05:59.192
Yeah, before this, it was
lawn chairs in the living room

05:59.226 --> 06:01.562
and a phone company spool
for a table.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.397
That's when we were
just starting out

06:03.431 --> 06:05.599
and I wasn't the mogul
I am now.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.769
But your mom saw a picture
of this set

06:08.802 --> 06:11.271
in a Montgomery Ward's
catalogue.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.240
Boy, did she
fall in love with it.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.942
A catalogue?

06:14.975 --> 06:18.378
It must've taken a while for
the stagecoach to deliver it

06:18.412 --> 06:20.681
from Californee.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.084
You know, this mattress is still
in pretty good shape.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.619
Any of you guys
want it?

06:25.653 --> 06:26.787
Rock, paper, scissors.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.021
Loser gets the mattress

06:28.055 --> 06:30.624
we were conceived on
and Mom died on.

06:30.658 --> 06:34.261
Ew. I don't want
a humpy-ghosty mattress!

06:34.294 --> 06:36.430
Well, we shouldn't
waste it.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.931
Oh, I'll give it
to Neville.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.133
He's treating a cow
with weeping shingles

06:40.167 --> 06:42.636
that needs something soft
to lie on.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.810
Harris, why are you
stealing food?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.379
Well, Mom didn't pack me a lunch
when she kicked me out,

06:52.412 --> 06:53.947
so I'm grabbing a meal.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.783
I thought you were living
with your boyfriend now.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.118
I was, but...

06:58.151 --> 07:00.788
his kids have been getting into
some trouble recently,

07:00.821 --> 07:03.290
so I'm giving them space
for a couple months.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.458
Don't tell Mom.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.627
What?
Where are you staying?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.762
I'm staying on a friend's couch
right now.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.098
Not really a-a friend,
a stranger

07:11.131 --> 07:13.133
who rents their couch out
on Craigslist.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.402
It's basically free. I just
have to call her "Grandma."

07:15.435 --> 07:16.470
Harris!

07:16.504 --> 07:18.405
It's safe. I'm fine.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.241
Speaking of couches,
who's the rando on ours?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.811
Oh, that's Isabella.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.246
She had a baby
and dropped out of school.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.583
She's one of the girls I'm
mentoring to help get their GED.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.418
And they get fed, too?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.121
Does one have to get knocked up
to get in on this action?

07:34.154 --> 07:36.189
Well, it helps.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.692
But if you really want
your application to stand out,

07:38.726 --> 07:41.829
join a gang
or stab your pimp.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.666
I brought you a soda
and a bologna sandwich

07:45.699 --> 07:46.967
in case you're hungry.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.369
You're not supposed to eat
lunch meat when you're nursing.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.805
Well, that explains
my brother.

07:51.839 --> 07:56.309
Thank you
for not bailing today.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.278
I know you have a lot
on your plate,

07:58.311 --> 07:59.713
but this is important,
too.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.382
It's fine. I want my GED.
Let's just do this.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.984
Did you do the reading?

08:04.017 --> 08:06.186
Yes.
Okay.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.489
Instead of going on to the next
chapter, like we usually do,

08:09.523 --> 08:12.325
let's review this chapter
and make sure you got it.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.861
Okay?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.730
Okay, so you read about
the Suffragette Movement.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.666
It's pretty cool
when you think about it.

08:18.699 --> 08:22.636
They empowered me,
and now I'm empowering you.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.337
What did you think?

08:24.371 --> 08:28.676
Well, the stuff women were doing
back then was mad empowering.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.211
That's a nice summary
of what I just said.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.846
Give me a specific.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.183
What did you think about, uh,
Marie Antoinette's contribution

08:36.216 --> 08:37.384
to the Nineteenth Amendment?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.886
It couldn't have happened
without her.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.022
Okay, you missed by 150 years
and a continent.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.391
You did this last week,
too.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.759
You're a smart person,

08:45.793 --> 08:48.361
and I can't help you
unless you do the reading.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.330
I'm trying,
but it's hard.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.332
I'm distracted at home,

08:52.365 --> 08:54.001
a-and I can't go to a library
and study

08:54.034 --> 08:56.103
because of the baby,
which is ironic,

08:56.136 --> 08:57.938
because I got pregnant
in a library.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.874
People just kept going "shh."

09:00.908 --> 09:04.878
Okay, I've got a big paper
I gotta finish by tomorrow,

09:04.912 --> 09:06.580
but I want you
to succeed.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.048
So, why don't you go home,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.083
and I'll come over
for a couple hours tonight

09:10.117 --> 09:12.385
to watch the baby while
you go to the library?

09:12.419 --> 09:15.288
That would be amazing.
Thank you.

09:15.322 --> 09:19.292
You're the Marie Antoinette
of mentors.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.662
Yeah, that's not
a good thing.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.735
Oh, sorry, ma'am.
No public bathrooms.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.902
Go to the park.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.773
I got you a gift. I'm coming in,
you new-age freak.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.876
Look, I know
you're doing inventory,

09:35.909 --> 09:37.778
but I was really anxious
to give you this.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.613
Wow.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.081
Huh.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.983
You got me a phone.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.619
Well,
who should I call?

09:45.653 --> 09:47.655
I'm gonna call you.
Hello, Darlene? It's Nick.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.923
Yeah, why'd you get me something
I told you I don't want?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.224
I know, I know,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.326
but I-I customized this phone
just for you.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.928
It's got
a meditation app,

09:54.962 --> 09:57.097
and the case is a fat,
smiling Buddha.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.066
Look how happy he is
to have a phone in his belly.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.736
Yeah, and that's not offensive
to billions of people at all.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.272
Look,
let's be honest here.

10:05.305 --> 10:09.076
Is that a gift for me,
or is that a gift for you?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.510
Both.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.512
I mean, I like spending time
with you,

10:12.545 --> 10:13.981
and when I'm not spending time
with you,

10:14.014 --> 10:15.348
I like to be able
to tell you

10:15.382 --> 10:17.350
how much I like spending time
with you.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.987
Mm-hmm.
I like to know what you're doing
and who you're with

10:20.020 --> 10:22.589
and be able to geo-locate you
while I do it.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.192
Is that so bad?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.928
So, okay, now we're at
the core issue.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.364
Have I done anything to make you
so suspicious of me?

10:31.398 --> 10:35.102
No, uh, I just
don't want to be a fool.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.137
Okay, well, if the only way
you can trust me

10:37.170 --> 10:39.539
is by being able
to track me 24/7,

10:39.572 --> 10:42.309
we don't have the foundation
for a good relationship.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.211
Well, I don't want to be
this kind of person.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.312
It's just now
that it's in my head,

10:45.345 --> 10:46.880
I can't stop worrying
about it.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.049
Well, maybe that's something
you should think about.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.218
And if you're on your phone
all the time

10:51.251 --> 10:53.520
trying to find me
on my friends' Instas,

10:53.553 --> 10:54.788
that makes it even worse.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.890
Right, but I'm not gonna get rid
of my phone.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.792
I don't think you could.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.328
Oh, I <i>could.</i>

11:01.361 --> 11:03.330
I left it on the roof of my car
one time

11:03.363 --> 11:05.032
and drove without it
for 20 minutes.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.034
I was fine.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.836
I bet you couldn't do
a day.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.170
I could totally
do a day.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.471
Then do it.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.573
And use that time to think about
why you don't trust me.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.709
Fine. Just to prove
I'm gonna do it...

11:15.743 --> 11:17.711
Okay. Uh-huh.
...I'm gonna give you
the phone.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.247
Just let me delete
a few texts here to Becky

11:20.280 --> 11:22.215
that may or may not
be about you.

11:22.249 --> 11:26.319
And set
my super-secret code,

11:26.353 --> 11:30.190
and set my exploding dye app
in case anyone tries to get in.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.524
And here you go.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.532
Sorry I'm late.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.168
I just got Kayley
to sleep.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.202
Where have you been?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.738
It's 2:00 AM.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.174
The library closed
four hours ago.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.276
I was this close
to calling the cops.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.412
Okay, I was totally
gonna go to the library,

11:52.445 --> 11:54.114
but then I got invited
to a concert,

11:54.147 --> 11:56.216
and I haven't been to a concert
in forever.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.886
But this time, I had
a babysitter, so I had to go.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.253
You know what it's like.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.222
I'm sure you went to go see
The Beatles or something.

12:02.255 --> 12:06.293
I am not Beatles old.
I'm not even Aerosmith old.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.029
You took advantage
of me.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.364
Why are you so freaked out?
It was one night.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.401
Because I gave up a night
with my kid to watch yours,

12:14.434 --> 12:16.036
and I didn't
get my paper done

12:16.069 --> 12:18.238
because your baby
was crying all night.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.373
By the way,
she shrieks like a bus

12:20.407 --> 12:23.443
that needs brakes driven
by a tea kettle!

12:23.476 --> 12:25.946
Why are you
so high and mighty?

12:25.979 --> 12:28.215
You dropped out of school
when you were my age, too.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.784
Yeah, and I would have killed
to have someone who cared enough

12:30.818 --> 12:32.585
to help me
get back on track.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.155
What? You're supposed to be
my role model?

12:35.188 --> 12:38.358
A 46-year-old loser
living in her dad's basement?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.762
Sorry to waste your time.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.075
If you're
thinking you can make a phone

12:55.108 --> 12:56.609
out of parts
of a toaster,

12:56.643 --> 13:00.613
"Gilligan's Island"
taught me you need a coconut.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.649
I'm just doing
what Nick said --

13:02.682 --> 13:04.751
spending some time
without my phone,

13:04.784 --> 13:07.254
thinking about why I've got
a perfectly great guy

13:07.287 --> 13:08.355
and I don't trust him.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.323
Yeah, he's a sweet guy.
Why don't you trust him?

13:10.357 --> 13:13.126
You started this. You told me
he was hiding extra wives

13:13.160 --> 13:14.794
and girlfriends
all over town.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.296
I say a lot of things.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.598
This is clearly
about your filter.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.667
And you're dodging
the question.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.769
What are you doing
with the toaster?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.638
Well, I started digging in
to why I distrust him,

13:25.672 --> 13:27.140
and it made me
really anxious,

13:27.174 --> 13:30.543
so the next logical move
was to take apart a toaster.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.480
Coming through.
Watch your back.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.615
Dad, tell them how much
you're asking for the dresser.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.884
500 bucks.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.386
What?! The only way that
dresser's worth 500 bucks

13:39.419 --> 13:42.689
is if there's a bag of cocaine
taped under one of the drawers.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.724
Yeah, and the drawer's
in a better dresser.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.895
New furniture's
gonna be expensive.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.729
I need to get top dollar
for this stuff.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.833
So, you're taking apart
a toaster

13:53.867 --> 13:55.869
because you felt anxious.

13:55.903 --> 13:59.339
Why does thinking of Nick
cheating make you feel this way?

13:59.372 --> 14:02.142
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.144
And he's obviously
a good guy,

14:04.177 --> 14:05.979
and I'm still afraid
he's gonna hurt me.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.047
Mm-hmm.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.649
The question is,
why don't I trust him?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.151
I don't know.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.186
Sometimes, when I
think something bad
about somebody else,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.822
it's usually because
I'm capable of the same thing.

14:15.855 --> 14:19.526
I used to think everybody else
was crazy, but hello!

14:21.962 --> 14:23.763
No, you're right.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.233
I'm the reason
that I don't trust Nick.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.968
I-I gotta go call him.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.604
Doesn't have a phone.
What a jackass.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.080
What the hell happened
to my toaster?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.881
Oh, Darlene had to
work something out.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.416
I can help you put it
back together again.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.219
Hey, maybe you can get
a couple grand for it.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.891
Okay, here comes
somebody else.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.760
Now, just try and be reasonable
this time.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.463
Listen to the offer
before you attack him.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.232
I've had this furniture
most of my adult life.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.368
It's like somebody offering you
100 bucks

15:01.401 --> 15:02.635
for one of your kids.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.804
Wait a minute.
Didn't you bet D.J.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.639
in one of your card games
one time?

15:06.673 --> 15:09.042
Yeah, but I knew
nobody wanted him.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.643
Hello, sir.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.981
You look like a person who knows
quality furniture on the street

15:14.014 --> 15:15.082
when you see it.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.749
Yeah, it looks like
a nice little set.

15:16.783 --> 15:17.817
How long have you
had this stuff?

15:17.850 --> 15:20.820
43 years.
A lot of good memories.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.323
Plus, no veneers,
dovetail joints.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.158
You'd be proud to
own a set like this.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.660
Nice. I'll give you 50 bucks
for all of it.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.730
Easy.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.565
50 whole dollars.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.901
Gee whiz, mister,
that's a lot of money...

15:34.934 --> 15:36.803
for a kid
shoveling snow.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.907
But I'm a grown man, and I am
selling this dresser for $500.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.175
You-- You're kidding,
right?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.611
No, sir, I am not.
$2,000 for the whole set.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.346
Take it or leave it.
You're dreaming, man.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.015
I'll go 100 bucks.
No more.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.183
Keep walking.
Okay. No.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.619
Hey! Hey! Hold on.
Dan, it's a yard sale.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.155
Negotiating, huh?
That's all a part of it.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.856
You're not that far apart.

15:56.889 --> 16:00.560
He said $100,
you're at $2,000.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.863
I'm not going
any higher.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.432
I'm saving you the cost
of a salvage truck.

16:05.465 --> 16:10.303
Okay, he's firm at $100, so,
Dan, your counteroffer is...?

16:10.337 --> 16:11.704
Kiss my ass.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.974
He's still firm
at $2,000.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.977
Yard sale's over.

16:18.011 --> 16:22.382
Well, I'm not
carrying this stuff back inside.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.321
Hey.
Hi.

16:28.355 --> 16:32.025
So, what'd you do with all
that time on your hands?

16:32.059 --> 16:34.527
I destroyed a toaster.
Mm.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.796
And then I started
thinking about

16:36.829 --> 16:38.998
why all my relationships
went bad.

16:39.032 --> 16:42.135
You know, not all guys are gonna
cheat on you, Darlene.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.303
Yeah.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.073
Um, I was actually the one
that cheated.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.308
You cheated on someone?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.477
Yeah. And I lied.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.479
And I think
I'm a pretty good person,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.547
so if someone like me
can do crap like that,

16:54.581 --> 16:57.984
I just figure anybody can,
even a nice guy like you.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.719
Wow.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.521
Some people spend years
in therapy

17:01.554 --> 17:03.256
before they get to
that kind of revelation.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.059
Yeah, well, I'm broke.
I gotta get there faster.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.697
So, uh, the cheating
and the lying,

17:10.730 --> 17:12.065
was that, like,
a one-off

17:12.099 --> 17:14.367
or more like an
every-guy-you-get-involved-with

17:14.401 --> 17:16.836
kind of thing?
Oh, no,
just the last guy.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.339
I sabotaged the rest of them
in all different ways.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.374
You'll see.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.909
I guess I'll take
the burner phone back.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.344
No, no. No way.
No, no, no.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.679
Now I know I need to
keep tabs on <i>you.</i>

17:26.713 --> 17:30.417
Kidding. But, you know, maybe
I'll keep it so we can text.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.552
Maybe I'll text you
during the day.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.521
Whoa.
Stop smothering me.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.389
You're gonna drive me
into the arms of another man.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.059
But, actually,
i-it will be nice

17:40.093 --> 17:43.029
to text my boyfriend
whenever I want to.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.698
Crooked smile,
prayer hands emoji.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.701
Am I your boyfriend?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.070
Now I really wish
I was texting.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.972
Blush-face, heart-eyes.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.078
Oh, the queen has risen
from her chambers.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.114
I'm not in the mood
for your crap!

18:03.283 --> 18:05.385
I'm sorry.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.587
I didn't get home from
Isabella's until 3:00,

18:07.620 --> 18:10.089
and I still had to
finish my paper for school.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.659
Wow. You're really committed
to helping those girls out.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.961
Good for you.
Yeah, it was all
for nothing.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.230
She wasn't serious
about the program.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.232
Well, you did your best.
Can't win 'em all.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.500
I hate it.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.069
I made a difference in the lives
of the other girls,

18:23.102 --> 18:25.472
and Isabella was gonna be
my third success.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.140
Is this about
helping people

18:27.174 --> 18:30.477
or how many successes you can
notch on your bedpost?

18:30.510 --> 18:31.744
No,
that makes it sound like

18:31.778 --> 18:33.480
I'm saying that you're sleeping
with the girls.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.482
I didn't intend that.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.984
You're saying I'm making this
more about myself

18:38.017 --> 18:39.586
than about the girls,

18:39.619 --> 18:43.190
that maybe I see them as me
when I was younger

18:43.223 --> 18:46.125
and I'm trying
to fix my mistakes?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.928
But they're not me,
so I have to accept

18:48.961 --> 18:52.365
that I can only save the ones
who want to be saved.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.468
Well, it wouldn't have meant
as much if I'd just told you.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.170
You had to find it.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.341
Wow, I helped Darlene earlier,
now I've straightened you out.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.443
I'm on fire!

19:03.476 --> 19:05.945
I smell smoke.
Am I on fire?!

19:05.978 --> 19:07.714
No.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.016
I-It's coming
from the backyard.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.456
What the hell?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.859
Some guy low-balled Dad on
the furniture and he snapped.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.894
Please tell me you took
the guy's wallet and rings

19:21.928 --> 19:24.197
before you threw him
in there?

19:24.231 --> 19:27.700
This isn't a funeral pyre.
It's a celebration.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.303
Alright. Then we'll talk
about the guy's life

19:30.337 --> 19:33.406
and why
he was wonderful.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.142
I didn't kill anybody.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.644
Yet.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.813
This is a lot more
than just a bedroom set.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.816
When I first married
your mom,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.219
her family said
I wouldn't amount to anything.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.154
We did say that.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.489
Yeah, you did.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.492
In a lot of ways, I thought
they might be right.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.427
I had to prove to myself
that they weren't,

19:54.461 --> 19:56.729
so when your mom
wanted this set,

19:56.763 --> 19:58.731
I worked my ass off
to get it for her --

19:58.765 --> 20:00.600
two jobs
and a year of layaway.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.569
And when I finally
brought it home,

20:02.602 --> 20:05.204
that's when I realized
I could step up

20:05.238 --> 20:08.575
and do the things I needed to do
to be a husband and a father.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.510
I get it.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.744
As a husband and a father,

20:11.778 --> 20:16.283
sometimes I feel the need
to burn some things, too.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.619
I get it, too.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.055
Yeah, not in the spine-chilling
way that D.J. just described,

20:23.089 --> 20:25.558
but that,
you know, sometimes,

20:25.592 --> 20:28.261
you gotta honor a memory
like that with a ceremony.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.597
I always thought the Vikings
did it best.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.933
Set it on fire, send it to
the heavens.

20:35.802 --> 20:39.071
And if it goes the other way,
Mom gets her bedroom set back.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.841
Oh,
I like that thought.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.978
There's something about standing
around a fire with your family

20:46.012 --> 20:47.547
at Christmastime.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.616
It is kind of magical.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.651
I always thought it'd be
the house on fire

20:51.684 --> 20:54.921
because of the wiring,
but this is nice.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.628
Hey, do you still have that
bedroom set I saw earlier?

21:01.661 --> 21:03.463
I'll give you two grand for it
right now.

21:03.496 --> 21:06.966
The items are no longer
available.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.435
That's too bad.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.303
They don't make vintage stuff
like that anymore.

21:10.337 --> 21:13.806
Oh, man. I wish you'd been here
an hour ago.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.343
You don't, by any chance,
need a mattress, do you?

21:16.376 --> 21:17.477
I do.

21:17.510 --> 21:21.147
I got one
I can let you have for $500.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.182
And I guarantee,
it's totally vintage.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.453
Come on. I just need a ride
down to the vet clinic.
