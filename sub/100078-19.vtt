WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:07.007
That day, when I found out
I couldn't have children...

00:07.091 --> 00:09.343
You pushed me away and ran into
another man's arms.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.847
This is Auggie.
One of my students.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.390
I haven't been
able to reach his foster mom.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.101
It's too much, and I can't...

00:17.184 --> 00:18.894
No one wants a sick kid.

00:18.978 --> 00:22.523
DCFS is gonna start looking
for a new foster placement tomorrow.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.859
And we'll spend the night with Auggie.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.695
-HANNAH: You wanna come up?
-I just wonder if that's a good idea.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.906
There's actually very little difference
between drug addiction...

00:30.990 --> 00:32.491
And romance addiction?

00:32.575 --> 00:34.160
Let's go up and discuss it.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.166
HANNAH: Did you really use
all of my floss?

00:41.083 --> 00:42.501
I told you, if we're gonna
keep doing this,

00:42.585 --> 00:43.919
I need a toothbrush.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.045
I don't know.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.631
I feel like it gives a guy
too great a sense of security.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.467
Or does it just prevent cavities?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.427
No, that is a gateway toiletry.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.263
And before I know it, you're gonna
have your own curling iron here,

00:54.346 --> 00:56.056
you'll have your own loofah...

00:56.140 --> 00:58.184
You've clearly given this
a great deal of thought.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.393
Maybe a little bit.

01:04.607 --> 01:06.525
It's been a really good couple of weeks.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.028
Yeah, it has.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.155
And not just us.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.616
You've been knocking it out of the park.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.202
I mean, work.
Everything. Rehab.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.163
I'm really proud of you.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.464
Just so you know,

01:29.715 --> 01:31.050
the more you kiss me,

01:31.801 --> 01:34.220
the more it makes me think I should get
you that toothbrush.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.514
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.980
What's nice is as we progress
through the surgery

01:45.064 --> 01:47.358
we can slide the retractor down,
there you go,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.151
go ahead and bring that blade down.

01:49.235 --> 01:51.779
Now, you wanna keep the most tension on,
so go ahead and tighten it up.

01:51.862 --> 01:52.988
Hey, April?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.993
-Never mind.
-Ethan!

01:59.829 --> 02:01.330
Ethan, hey.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.000
He was showing me some new equipment.
-I'm sure he was.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.461
I'm his Hybrid OR nurse.
You know that.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.255
-Learning is part of the job.
-Right.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.631
What is this?

02:11.423 --> 02:14.426
You're sleeping on the couch,
you want nothing to do with me.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.803
Why do you care?

02:22.768 --> 02:23.769
(SIGHS)

02:25.729 --> 02:27.273
Hey, Dr. Marcel, I'm sorry.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.357
No, it's all good.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.943
I gotta deal with some inventory anyway.
We'll finish up later.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.241
-Morning, Dr. Manning.
-Morning, Crockett.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.784
-How's your day?
-Great.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.120
You realize you say that every day.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.496
Every day is great.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.123
MAGGIE: We got two traumas coming in.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.583
Dr. Choi! You're going to Two.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.294
-Dr. Marcel? Take her to Baghdad.
-Copy.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.129
What do we got?

02:50.212 --> 02:52.965
Zach Brand, 15,
says he fell off an overpass.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.258
Is that true? You fell?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.510
PARAMEDIC: Fractured his left arm,
he's got a pretty good bruise on his head.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.679
GCS 13, pressure and heart rate are good.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.015
-All right, Zach. Any of this hurt?
-Uh-uh.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.224
All right. He looks stable,

03:02.308 --> 03:04.643
but let's get a chest X-ray and a pan scan
just to be safe.

03:04.727 --> 03:07.479
Let's get ready to transfer.
Wait a second.

03:07.563 --> 03:08.981
Zach, where did this glass come from?

03:09.648 --> 03:10.691
Zach?

03:11.233 --> 03:12.401
We'll figure this out.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.945
All right, let's transfer on my count.
Ready? One, two, three.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.532
I've got Terrie Cross,
intubated in the field.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.993
Status post-MVC, car versus divider,

03:21.076 --> 03:24.413
GCS 3T, BP 95 over 60,

03:24.496 --> 03:27.249
heart rate 130, satting at 86%.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.500
Yeah, I'm not liking this rhythm.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.794
Gimme an EKG with trops and trauma labs.
Let's go.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.671
She's coding. No pulse.

03:33.631 --> 03:36.133
Get him up for those scans.
I'll check in as soon as you're back.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.761
MARCEL: Here we go.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.679
Come on, folks.
We know what this is.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.556
-ETHAN: What's up?
-MARCEL: She's in v-fib. Let's go.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.851
On my count.
One, two, three.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.063
Gimme the paddles.
Charge to 200.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.440
-She could be in blunt cardiac arrest.
-Charged.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.859
Open it up.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.195
Clear.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.529
(BEEPING)

03:58.113 --> 03:59.657
-I got a pulse.
-Sinus tach.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.033
For now. What happened?

04:01.116 --> 04:03.369
-Single vehicle crash.
-Any drugs or alcohol on board?

04:03.452 --> 04:04.578
Rapid tox was negative.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.914
Why'd she hit the median?
Stroke? Seizure?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.999
Wait, wait, wait.
She's got glass shards on her.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.542
So does the kid in Trauma Two.
It's from her windshield.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.711
-How do you know?
-He fell off an overpass.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.254
And landed on her.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.602
ETHAN: No breath sounds on the left.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.813
Let's set her up for a chest tube.
What do you got?

04:30.896 --> 04:33.065
Some fluid on the right,
but I can't find her spleen.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.233
ETHAN: What do you mean you can't find it?

04:34.316 --> 04:37.486
-I mean it's not there.
-It's gotta be in there somewhere.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.742
Go back up.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.413
Right there.
That's the tip.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.497
Can't be. It's too high.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.999
That's right, 'cause it's in her chest.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.583
All right. She must've ruptured
her diaphragm.

04:51.667 --> 04:52.835
Chest tube's ready.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.753
Nope, she's hypotensive.
We're going to the Hybrid OR, now.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.588
No, no, no, no. Stop.
If it's a tension pneumo,

04:56.672 --> 04:58.007
we can't move her
till we decompress the lung.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.135
There's no time. I'll do it in the OR.
Let's go. Come on.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.431
Easy, easy.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.063
MADELINE: We just wanted to come
say a quick hello

05:13.147 --> 05:14.481
before we finished up the paperwork.

05:14.565 --> 05:15.691
Of course.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.819
Maggie, Madeline's found
foster parents for Auggie.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.363
That's great. He can't wait to get
out of the hospital.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.781
(CHUCKLES)

05:23.615 --> 05:27.286
-MADELINE: So?
-What a sweet kid.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.829
He is.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.040
Except when he doesn't get
his Nutella for breakfast.

05:31.749 --> 05:34.585
Oh, and he doesn't like anything
but bubblegum toothpaste.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.337
No fruit flavors and definitely not mint.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.464
As you can see,

05:38.547 --> 05:41.133
Maggie has become quite attached
in the past couple of weeks.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.885
We know how it is.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.887
We've been fostering for 12 years.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.097
MADELINE: Auggie is going
to a loving family.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.517
So let's cross the T's, dot the I's,

05:50.601 --> 05:52.478
hopefully you'll be able
to take him home tonight.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.113
MAGGIE: Who's winning?

06:03.197 --> 06:05.365
We both have 16 life points left,

06:05.449 --> 06:09.286
but as soon as my Jace uses his Ultimate,
he's toast.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.581
I have no idea what's going on.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.124
(LAUGHS)

06:17.002 --> 06:19.630
So, what did you think of those people?

06:20.422 --> 06:21.840
-They're nice.
-MAGGIE: Yeah?

06:24.843 --> 06:27.721
I'm sorry, you two,
but I gotta get to school.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.848
Finish this later? Wanna drag it out?

06:30.432 --> 06:32.101
Mmm.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.227
I'm good.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.355
Okay, honey.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.818
-You keep an eye on this guy.
-Oh, I will.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.654
You mind if I take a look?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.155
-Okay.
-Yeah?

06:48.117 --> 06:49.701
-(GROANS)
-Ooh.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.829
-Your tummy hurt?
-Mmm-hmm.

06:55.791 --> 06:56.875
You getting cold?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.169
You know what I'm gonna do?

06:59.878 --> 07:03.048
I'm gonna ask my friend Dr. Manning

07:03.632 --> 07:05.300
to come and take a look at you.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.886
Just to make sure everything's all right.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.638
Okay.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.432
Meanwhile, why don't you get some rest?

07:13.809 --> 07:15.769
And when Mr. Campbell comes?

07:17.813 --> 07:19.022
(SOFTLY) Don't go easy on him.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.537
ETHAN: Hey, Zach.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.205
So we got your scans back.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.083
-Good news, it's just a simple fracture.
-Okay.

07:38.167 --> 07:39.918
And your parents are on their way.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.047
Mind if I check your eyes?

07:47.759 --> 07:52.264
So, how did you go over the edge
of that overpass?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.517
The railing was kinda low, I guess.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.562
Okay.

07:59.563 --> 08:03.525
But, uh, I mean, were you fooling
around with your friends?

08:05.027 --> 08:06.028
You lose your balance?

08:08.488 --> 08:11.617
Could... Could we do this later?
My head really hurts.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.535
Sure.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.746
But I do wanna make sure that you're okay

08:15.829 --> 08:17.956
and that something like this
doesn't happen again.

08:18.999 --> 08:23.128
So I'll have another doctor come in
and see you in a bit, okay?

08:24.338 --> 08:25.797
Maybe you'll feel up to talking then.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.225
I have to ask.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.102
Do I think he jumped?
Yeah, I do.

08:39.645 --> 08:42.522
We're out looking for witnesses now,
but if he did jump,

08:42.606 --> 08:44.691
we'll have to arrest him
for vehicular endangerment,

08:44.775 --> 08:47.027
-and possibly manslaughter.
-Easy, Rosado.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.780
If Zach attempted suicide,
first thing that happens,

08:49.863 --> 08:50.948
we put him on a psych hold.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.159
Hey, Trini. Call Dr. Charles.
Tell him we need a consult.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.711
-WILL: What do we got?
-Marcie Burton, 19 weeks pregnant

09:04.795 --> 09:06.546
with mild vaginal bleeding, vitals stable.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.007
-Okay, thanks.
-I called the ambulance just to be safe.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.843
Good.
Hi, Marcie. I'm Dr. Halstead,

09:11.927 --> 09:13.011
this is student Dr. Curry.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.429
I'm not losing the baby, am I?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.974
We're gonna take a look right now.
When did the bleeding start?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.141
This morning.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.685
It wasn't much, but it hasn't stopped.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.019
This will be a little cold.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.355
(HEART BEATING)

09:23.438 --> 09:24.439
MARCIE: Is it moving?

09:25.357 --> 09:26.608
Is it okay?

09:26.692 --> 09:29.569
Well, the fetus is fine,
but you do have placenta previa.

09:29.653 --> 09:30.696
Is that bad?

09:30.779 --> 09:33.198
Uh, it depends. It could be,
if the bleeding gets worse.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.700
Then you need to stop it.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.285
Well, we are certainly gonna do
everything we can.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.744
I have brain cancer.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.371
I'm sorry?

09:41.415 --> 09:42.457
Stage four.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.169
Which means this is my last chance
to have a family.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.633
-How long ago were you diagnosed?
-Eight months.

09:51.717 --> 09:54.428
Though her tumor's been stable lately,
and the scans have been good.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.512
MARCIE: Ron.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.182
I don't have time
to start another pregnancy.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.811
And my baby will be viable
in just a few more weeks.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.271
So, please...

10:04.354 --> 10:05.355
Help me.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.316
Okay.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.442
Let me go over your chart

10:08.525 --> 10:10.444
and have Obstetrics
come down to take a look.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.945
Then we'll figure out
where to go from there.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.363
Thank you.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.453
Call Dr. Asher.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.539
Dr. Asher? What?
Are you sure?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.958
Yeah. She's the best.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.760
He has a GI bleed
and his liver is getting worse.

10:34.843 --> 10:35.969
What are you gonna do?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.763
Send him for a TIPS procedure.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.140
You think he needs something
that invasive?

10:40.223 --> 10:42.893
Any more damage moving forward
will be irreversible.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.020
Sooner we can take the pressure off his
vasculature, the better.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.940
(SIGHS) He was really hoping
to go home with his new family today.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.526
Well, TIPS has a pretty quick recovery.
Maybe tomorrow.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.487
Yeah.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.490
-I'm gonna call over to IR.
-Okay. Thanks.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.578
MARTY: Rhythm's not great.
We gotta move.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.163
MARCEL: I'm on it.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.083
I need better exposure.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.210
Okay, you remember how
I showed you to insert the larger blade?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.544
Yes, I do.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.597
-No, slide it all the way.
-Okay.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.977
-(GRUNTS)
-MARCEL: Loosen it up, loosen it up.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.899
-APRIL: Okay. Got it.
-Okay, good. Let's do this.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.988
Nope, I need a better angle.

11:37.572 --> 11:38.615
Okay.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.618
-How do I know...
-Okay, hold on. Switch with me.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.286
She's not gonna hold out
if you can't get this going soon.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.746
MARCEL: Yeah, I gotcha, Marty.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.584
Okay, there we go. Don't let go.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.336
APRIL: Sorry, Dr. Marcel.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.797
Don't sweat it. Just get a 2-0 ready
for the diaphragm.

11:57.134 --> 12:01.012
One, two, three.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.184
(SIGHS)

12:10.230 --> 12:11.523
-Dr. Marcel?
-Yeah.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.860
I think you should start
training a new nurse for the Hybrid Room.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.112
-What are you talking about?
-I slowed you down today.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.448
No. Hey, it was a tough case
with new equipment.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.825
No, it was because of the whole
thing with Ethan.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.744
It got in the way
and there's no excuse for that.

12:26.288 --> 12:29.166
Look, April, you're my nurse
and you're the best.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.960
I'm not gonna train anyone else.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.879
Okay?

12:34.588 --> 12:35.589
Okay.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.851
Dr. Choi, Zach's parents are here.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.228
-He fell off the overpass? How is he?
-Is he all right?

12:50.312 --> 12:52.772
Zach has a broken arm
that he's getting cast right now,

12:52.856 --> 12:54.357
but otherwise,
just some scrapes and bruises.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.568
-(SIGHS)
-Oh, thank God.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.112
Mr. and Mrs. Brand, I'm Dr. Charles.
I haven't actually met Zach yet,

12:59.196 --> 13:02.240
but I was looking forward to saying hello
in a few minutes.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.910
Psychiatry?
I don't understand.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.953
I just wanna ask him a few questions.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.206
-Get a better sense of what happened.
-What does that mean?

13:10.165 --> 13:11.666
Well, just that.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.461
Wait. Don't tell me you think he jumped.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.296
Based on Dr. Choi's assessment,

13:16.379 --> 13:18.965
it seems like there might be a possibility
and so, I just,

13:19.049 --> 13:22.010
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't say a quick hello.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.970
-Oh, my God.
-HARRIS: Honey, no, no.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.764
That's ridiculous.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.098
It's those kids he hangs out with.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.308
They're wild.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.852
They were probably goofing around
and it went too far.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.103
Very possible.

13:32.187 --> 13:35.148
But it's not so easy to accidentally
fall off one of those things.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.318
You know what? I bet he got pushed
by that homeless guy.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.238
-Yeah.
-Homeless guy?

13:41.321 --> 13:44.491
Yeah. There's this man who stands
on that overpass, screaming all day.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.117
He's psychotic, and dangerous.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.244
Huh.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.997
Okay. Well, I'm sure the police
will look into that,

13:51.081 --> 13:52.123
but in the meantime,

13:52.207 --> 13:54.000
we just wanna make sure we're not
missing anything.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.961
Zach could've died today. Okay?

13:56.044 --> 13:59.214
The last thing he needs
is to be interrogated by a shrink.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.008
Now, which one's his room?

14:03.385 --> 14:04.386
Treatment Five.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.850
Are we gonna have a hard time with them?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.852
The dad, yeah.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.272
The mom, not so sure.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.651
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

14:19.734 --> 14:21.111
Hey, Mom.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.363
Hey.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.534
Okay.

14:28.118 --> 14:31.621
Michael, tell me.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.083
Meet the newest Clinical Device Specialist
for Kender Bio Systems.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.296
You got the job.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.131
Yeah, joining the Kender team right here.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.799
-Here at Med?
-Mmm-hmm.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.718
And given the size of the contract,
they need more people.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.094
That's wonderful.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.515
Mom, I know you always
wanted me to be a doctor.

14:50.599 --> 14:53.852
-Michael, I just wanted you...
-BOTH: ...to be happy.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.270
I know, but believe me,

14:55.353 --> 14:57.188
Kender's training is like going
to med school.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.065
I'll know more about the devices
than the docs

14:59.149 --> 15:01.318
and I'll be in the OR
right alongside them.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.278
I'm so proud of you.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.071
I gotta hook up with my supervisor.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.615
-Take you to lunch?
-It's a date.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.824
All right.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.875
Zach, how you doing?
I'm Dr. Charles.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.209
He's a psychiatrist.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.629
-Legally, we have to let him talk to you.
-Harris.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.548
I'm really just here to help, Zach,
and was hoping

15:23.632 --> 15:25.717
to ask you a few quick questions about
what happened today.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.886
Okay.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.388
Okay. So... So, this morning
you left your house,

15:30.472 --> 15:32.182
and where were you headed?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.976
Nowhere. I was just taking a walk.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.645
DANIEL: Okay.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.439
-By yourself.
-Yeah.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.316
DANIEL: Okay. Got it.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.778
So you get to this overpass
and what happened then?

15:46.821 --> 15:49.449
Tell him about that homeless man, Zach.
Like you told us.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.953
Yeah. There was...

15:54.037 --> 15:58.708
There was this guy who was
yelling and acting crazy.

15:59.459 --> 16:03.171
-Right.
-And, uh, he started shoving me

16:03.254 --> 16:06.007
and I tried to get out of the way,
but he... He wouldn't stop,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.010
and before I knew it, I lost my balance.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.015
All right.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.310
Well, um, you know,
Zach's been through a lot today.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.688
Has anybody asked him
if he wants anything to eat?

16:19.771 --> 16:21.064
-No.
-DANIEL: No?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.317
Are you hungry, buddy?
How about a sandwich?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.696
-Maybe turkey.
-DANIEL: Okay.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.365
Um, why don't we get going on that

16:30.448 --> 16:33.535
and then when we get back,
maybe we can talk a little bit more. Okay?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.496
-Nice to meet you, Zach.
-KATIE: Thank you.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.085
You know his parents
coached him to say that.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.546
-Are they worried he's gonna get arrested?
-Probably.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.006
Look. Even if Zach won't admit he jumped,

16:47.090 --> 16:49.426
we gotta put him on a psych hold
for his own good.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.510
A forced hold?

16:51.302 --> 16:55.140
Taking a minor away from his parents,
a very high bar to clear, you know?

16:55.223 --> 16:57.350
And more importantly,
it doesn't really tend to work

16:57.434 --> 16:59.436
unless you get buy-in
from the whole family.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.312
But we can't let a suicidal kid
walk out of here.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.731
I hear you.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.942
Look, let's see what a turkey
sandwich gets us. Okay?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.278
Moms love to see their kids get fed.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.616
Her cervix isn't handling the weight
of the growing fetus

17:13.700 --> 17:14.701
and is starting to open up.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.536
She's already dilated one centimeter.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.079
Then she's going to lose the pregnancy.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.206
Maybe not. I'd like to try her
on progesterone,

17:20.290 --> 17:22.083
see if we can stop her
from dilating any farther.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.251
Wait, is that safe?

17:23.334 --> 17:26.004
I mean, given her increased chance
of infection and bleeding?

17:26.087 --> 17:29.674
This is a unique situation,
due to her limited time frame.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.635
This pregnancy is very important to her.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.804
I'd like to try and save it.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.974
Okay, then. Thanks.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.813
Dr. Halstead, I've read the literature

17:43.897 --> 17:46.316
on cervical insufficiency with bleeding
in high-risk patients

17:46.399 --> 17:49.068
and trying to intervene
is not the standard of care.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.988
Dr. Asher is the specialist
and I trust her.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.157
She's had a drug problem.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.244
That is irrelevant.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.121
You are way out of line, Ms. Curry.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.381
He's cold, and he's getting
a little short of breath.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.634
What's taking IR so long to get him
down for his TIPS?

18:12.717 --> 18:14.761
They're always backed up.
I'll give them a call.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.147
-Wait. He's not even on the schedule.
-What?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.983
I put the order in an hour ago.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.278
Uh-uh. It says he's been denied.
By DCFS.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.989
-Can they do that?
-I don't know.

18:37.867 --> 18:38.910
Come on.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.334
Madeline!

18:46.417 --> 18:50.255
If this is about Auggie, I'm sorry,
but until the Kramers get final approval,

18:50.338 --> 18:51.840
the state is still Auggie's
legal guardian.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.968
-What?
-He's getting worse. He needs this.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.220
MADELINE: According to the Illinois
health service protocols,

18:57.303 --> 18:59.973
TIPS is only indicated
if two other previous treatments fail.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.226
That's just a guideline.
Every patient is different.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.062
Which is why I've already escalated this

19:06.145 --> 19:08.940
to a physician mediator
appointed by the state.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.734
That's gonna take days.
He needs this now.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.279
All right, look. He's at risk
for encephalopathy, peritonitis...

19:14.362 --> 19:15.613
I understand.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.657
Madeline, he needs someone
to advocate for him.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.158
And I'm trying my best.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.036
There's nothing else I can do.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.758
Dr. Lanik.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.011
Do you remember Auggie Roberts?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.345
Foster kid? Sure.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.680
He's getting worse.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.891
I was wondering, could you write a note

19:42.974 --> 19:45.560
saying that he'd do well to receive
a TIPS procedure?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.604
He's upstairs now.
Get his pediatrician to do it.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.189
She did.
But there's some red tape.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.025
I thought if we had a double doc

19:52.108 --> 19:53.693
we could convene an ethics committee
and we could...

19:53.776 --> 19:55.987
Oh, so my "quick note" is turning into
an afternoon in front of a committee?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.739
-Dr. Lanik...
-Maggie, I have patients to see

19:57.822 --> 20:00.658
and you have a waiting room
full of them to process.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.371
(SIGHS)

20:06.205 --> 20:08.291
Three centimeters.
You're still progressing.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.751
So what do we do now?

20:09.834 --> 20:11.544
Well, we can try increasing
the progesterone.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.421
Give you a little more
time to see if we can turn this around.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.923
-I agree.
-ELSA: Are you sure?

20:15.506 --> 20:16.507
The longer we wait,

20:16.591 --> 20:18.551
the greater the chance
of a serious complication.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.886
I don't believe we're there yet.

20:20.678 --> 20:21.888
What do you think we should do?

20:23.765 --> 20:27.268
Terminate the pregnancy.
At this point, it's the safest option.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.686
What? No.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.522
Ms. Curry is a medical student,
not a doctor.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.608
I need to have this baby.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.989
So my husband can have someone
to love him as much as I do.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.492
And someone he can love.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.369
If I can have that,

20:45.328 --> 20:46.913
then I'm okay to die.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.753
We'll increase your meds
and check back in a little bit.

21:08.977 --> 21:12.021
You gonna get your nose
out of that laptop?

21:12.105 --> 21:14.983
I'm sorry, Mom.
I've just got so much prep to do.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.444
Let me ask you, Dr. Latham, CT surgeon,

21:18.528 --> 21:20.738
you know if he's into anything,
any hobbies?

21:21.322 --> 21:24.450
No, not really.
We don't socialize.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.036
A lot of CT surgeons are into cars.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.871
You know, vintage, racing...

21:28.955 --> 21:31.582
Yeah, that doesn't sound like Dr. Latham.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.212
How about Dr. Abrams?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.548
I hear his wife makes
some kind of power drink.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.550
-Is he a gym rat?
-Why are you asking this?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.219
Well, I'm gonna be working
with these guys.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.762
It'd be nice to have something
to talk about.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.849
Well, what about the medical devices
they'll be using?

21:47.932 --> 21:51.227
Well, that's a given, but you know
how touchy these surgeons can be.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.856
Since I'm gonna be coaching them,
I want to establish a rapport.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.401
Well, our surgeons
are at the top of their game.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.486
I doubt if they need any coaching.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.906
Sure. It's just we have
a lot of exciting new products

22:03.990 --> 22:05.742
I'll be introducing them to.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.454
And, you know, business is all
about relationships.

22:16.878 --> 22:20.214
I'm sorry, Dr. Charles,
but the Brands' lawyer is here,

22:20.298 --> 22:22.759
and apparently you can't speak to Zach

22:22.842 --> 22:24.635
until Legal gets it straightened out.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.101
Mr. and Mrs. Brand,
I just wanna let you know,

22:32.185 --> 22:34.187
the field officers have completed their
investigation.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.480
Did they find that homeless man?

22:35.563 --> 22:38.316
ROSADO: No. In fact, we couldn't find
any eyewitnesses at all.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.276
So, Zach can go?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.736
ETHAN: Hold on.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.322
There's still one more witness.
The woman who was driving the car.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.657
Oh, for God's sake, are you just trying
to get my son arrested?

22:46.741 --> 22:48.868
No, I'm trying to get him
the help he needs.

22:48.951 --> 22:52.497
Mr. and Mrs. Brand, if it turns out
that Zach did, in fact, jump,

22:52.580 --> 22:55.666
then I would be able,
hopefully with your blessing,

22:55.750 --> 22:58.544
to put him on a hold
and we can start to address this.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.463
He would likely be charged,

23:00.546 --> 23:03.091
but I will personally advocate for him,
and under the circumstances,

23:03.174 --> 23:05.384
can practically guarantee
he would not be prosecuted.

23:05.468 --> 23:06.886
My son is not suicidal.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.805
The driver's still unconscious.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.474
If she wakes up, we'll question her then.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.060
But in the meantime,
I can't keep him here any longer.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.812
I gotta let him go.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.980
(SIGHS) Thank you.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.651
Rosado.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.362
Don't let them leave just yet.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.241
I'll be right back.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.167
Crockett, I need you to wake her up.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.545
What? Why?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.171
The boy needs our help.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.506
All right, she's our only chance.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.342
If she confirms he jumped,
we can give him the help he needs.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.344
Yeah, I'm sorry, but she's not ready.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.637
Why not, huh?

23:49.720 --> 23:52.348
She's over-breathing the vent,
her vitals are stable.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.934
I just rebuilt her diaphragm
and her belly's open.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.395
-She's not there yet.
-Come on, man.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.647
You're telling me you can't lighten
her sedation for five minutes?

23:59.730 --> 24:02.567
If I wake her up now, she could
still go into a metabolic crisis.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.485
And if you don't,
there's a severely troubled kid

24:04.569 --> 24:05.736
who can't get the help he needs.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.530
Well, I don't know what to tell you, man,

24:07.613 --> 24:09.490
but I'm gonna do
what's best for my patient.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.002
That boy tries to kill himself again?

24:23.421 --> 24:24.422
That's on you.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.224
(ALARM BEEPING)

24:35.308 --> 24:36.809
His pressure's dropping.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.812
We need more suction, blood,
and drugs to intubate.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.023
What happened?

24:42.106 --> 24:43.983
He was coughing and then he just started
throwing up blood.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.819
Esophageal varices.
The pressure must've opened one up.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.738
Auggie, I need you to calm down, okay?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.406
We're gonna take good care of you.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.408
Auggie. Auggie, listen to me.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.534
-No...
-MAGGIE: Auggie...

24:53.618 --> 24:54.827
-Drugs are in.
-MAGGIE: I know this is scary,

24:54.911 --> 24:57.872
but you're so brave. I need you
to be brave just a little bit longer.

24:57.955 --> 24:58.998
Can you do that for me?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.000
-All right.
-NATALIE: He's out.

25:08.591 --> 25:10.009
I'm in. Bag him.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.929
All right, let's get him up
to the IR for a TIPS.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.141
Let's go.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.147
It's emergent now.
No need for consent.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.494
Yeah, we can do both.
Dr. Asher! Dr. Halstead!

25:36.577 --> 25:38.496
(ALARM BEEPING)

25:39.413 --> 25:40.498
HANNAH: Okay.

25:41.415 --> 25:42.875
She's losing the pregnancy.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.544
Marcie, I'm sorry, but we need to get
the fetus out now.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.171
-No! No!
-Marcie!

25:47.255 --> 25:48.881
It's okay. It's okay.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.343
Dr. Halstead.
Please don't let my baby die.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.554
-Hannah.
-Okay.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.265
We could try what's called a cerclage.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.016
It's a procedure
to tie your cervix closed,

25:59.100 --> 26:01.227
but in your case, we would have to go
in through the abdomen.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.646
What? With the placement of her placenta
and her bleeding,

26:03.729 --> 26:04.939
that would be extremely risky.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.065
How risky?

26:06.148 --> 26:08.359
Well, the chances of catastrophic
bleeding are high.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.945
Not to mention the significant
cardiac risks of anesthesia.

26:11.028 --> 26:13.406
It's true. There's no guarantee at all
that you would survive this.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.409
Honey... That sounds like a bad idea.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.078
-Do it.
-Marcie, we can always try again.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.747
No, we can't. You know that.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.332
Do it!

26:26.877 --> 26:28.254
All right. Let's go. Come on.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.630
Marcie. No!

26:29.714 --> 26:30.840
I love you.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.675
That's why I have to do this.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.265
Elsa, call the OR.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.351
Dr. Halstead, this is crazy.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.271
-Odds are that woman is gonna die.
-That's a risk she's willing to take.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.107
Well, are you doing this
because of your feelings for Dr. Asher?

26:48.691 --> 26:50.276
Call the OR, now.

26:53.529 --> 26:57.074
Please, it is a mistake to send Zach home.

26:57.158 --> 26:59.201
-I believe your son is depressed.
-HARRIS: Depressed?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.661
I hate that word.

27:00.745 --> 27:03.706
It's just an excuse for weakness.
Our son is not weak.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.709
Dr. Charles.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.878
(SIGHS)

27:08.961 --> 27:11.630
I think that we have said everything
there is to say, Dr. Choi.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.175
Unless, of course, there's something

27:14.258 --> 27:16.927
that either of you feel like
you might've left out.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.322
Her vitals look good.
How's her rhythm been?

27:36.405 --> 27:40.159
Stable. Dr. Marcel was talking about
lightening her sedation.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.078
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.890
Don't try to talk.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.018
You're intubated, in the hospital.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.269
You're safe.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.438
I just need to know,

28:10.856 --> 28:12.900
did you see the boy
who landed on your car?

28:17.279 --> 28:18.322
Okay.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.411
Did he get pushed?

28:26.455 --> 28:28.165
Or did he jump?

28:34.380 --> 28:35.923
Okay, please.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.843
Just think.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.805
You were driving toward the bridge.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.600
He was on it.
You saw him.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.689
Did he jump?

28:59.447 --> 29:00.489
Okay.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.460
Mr. Brand,

29:12.543 --> 29:15.629
we forgot to validate your parking.
Come with me.

29:16.714 --> 29:17.882
I'll be right back.

29:26.724 --> 29:30.144
Mrs. Brand, I think
that your son needs help.

29:31.145 --> 29:34.148
Now, I recognize
that your family situation is complicated.

29:34.231 --> 29:38.444
And I can't imagine how challenging
that must be under the circumstances.

29:39.028 --> 29:41.071
But, listen, here's my card.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.242
I hope you will call me any time
of the day or night.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.203
All right?

29:47.286 --> 29:49.497
The only thing that you don't wanna do

29:50.080 --> 29:51.874
is let your son go through this alone.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.501
(SIGHS)

29:53.584 --> 29:55.377
-Thank you.
-Okay.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.845
Hey. How's he doing?

30:05.346 --> 30:07.348
He finally got his procedure,
no thanks to you.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.477
Maggie, you know
that under the circumstances

30:11.560 --> 30:13.103
I did everything I could.

30:13.187 --> 30:16.482
Did you? Because it took him hemorrhaging
for him to get this.

30:20.194 --> 30:21.695
HANNAH: I can see the cervix.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.490
-Hold it gently so I can get it isolated.
-WILL: Mmm-hmm.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.659
-It's bleeding.
-HANNAH: It's too vascular.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.452
Laps to me.
Give her a gram of TXA.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.292
WILL: Still bleeding. More laps.

30:35.376 --> 30:36.794
-(BEEPING)
-Pressure's dropping.

30:37.378 --> 30:38.921
We may need to terminate the procedure.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.131
Watch her rhythm.
She's throwing PVC's.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.551
I think we need to call it.
Switch to a hysterotomy.

30:43.634 --> 30:44.927
HANNAH: No. Her water's still intact,

30:45.010 --> 30:47.012
and we've got plenty of blood in reserve.
We can still do this.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.139
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.767
Okay. Talk me through it.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.103
Release the laps
so I can get some celox in there.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.914
HANNAH: Okay, hold it steady
so I can get it packed.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.753
We did it.
How's she look?

31:19.837 --> 31:22.715
BP is coming back up, but I still can't
shake these irregular beats.

31:22.798 --> 31:23.966

out of the woods yet.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.259
Let's get ready to place the stitch.

31:28.137 --> 31:29.305
Where is he?

31:30.097 --> 31:31.140
Where is he?

You got a lot of nerve interfering
with my patient.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.020
I had to.
The boy needed help.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.354
The boy.
Don't kid yourself.

31:37.438 --> 31:38.856
This wasn't about him.
It was about me.

to talk to his mom alone.

I don't know.

I don't get it.

The boy is so deeply troubled,
but the dad just doesn't want to face it.

34:32.988 --> 34:36.366
Well, you know, maybe it's just, uh,

34:37.201 --> 34:41.830
easier for him to focus his anxiety
and anger elsewhere,

34:41.914 --> 34:45.542

of looking at the real problem, you know?

too much to handle.

So, he'll have to go back on the list?

I'm sorry.

35:55.362 --> 35:56.989
-Sharon?
-Yeah?

35:58.490 --> 35:59.533
We'll do it.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.994
We'll foster him.

36:03.704 --> 36:06.373
-Maggie, you don't have to do...
-No.

36:07.416 --> 36:08.750
We want to.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.086
Are you sure?

36:12.880 --> 36:16.216
Okay. I'll let DCFS know.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.695
WILL: Mr. Burton.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.365
I'm so sorry.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.161
(VOICE BREAKS) My wife made it
very clear what she wanted.

36:44.745 --> 36:46.538
Thank you for honoring her wishes.

36:48.457 --> 36:50.792
I always knew this day would come.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.296
Still, it's so hard...

37:21.949 --> 37:26.244
Hey, Hannah, today was a tough one.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.083
But you made the right decision.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.584
Yeah, but...

37:33.251 --> 37:35.212
Doesn't make it any easier.

37:38.340 --> 37:39.466
I need...

37:41.593 --> 37:43.929
I need to go to an NA meeting.

37:45.514 --> 37:46.598
Okay.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.518
I'll drive you.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.202
(SIGHS)

38:10.622 --> 38:13.333
Hey, Mom.
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:13.417 --> 38:14.751
See you tomorrow.

38:15.544 --> 38:18.005
-Dr. Lanik.
-Hey, Michael.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.675
Your son, he's a good salesman.

38:22.426 --> 38:23.468
Yeah?

38:23.552 --> 38:26.263
Yeah, he somehow knew
I was a scotch drinker.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.640
Gave me this great bottle of single malt.

38:44.740 --> 38:47.284
-Your eye okay?
-Yeah, I'll live.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.464
So, you sure have been making
a lot of new friends

39:00.547 --> 39:02.549
since coming over to the day shift.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.552
Yeah. That's what I do.

39:05.635 --> 39:06.636
Make friends.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.556
Are you okay, Crockett?

39:09.639 --> 39:11.224
Oh, yeah, that lidocaine works fast.

39:11.308 --> 39:13.435
-That's not what I meant.
-I know what you meant.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.688
Let's just keep it at the lidocaine.

39:21.735 --> 39:22.736
(SIGHS)

39:36.792 --> 39:38.043
(EXHALES)

39:40.796 --> 39:43.507
Really? You hit him?

39:49.304 --> 39:50.430
Yeah.

39:52.015 --> 39:53.725
The thing is, April,

39:55.894 --> 39:58.605
it was so easy for me
to see Crockett as the problem.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.315
Yeah, and I told you

40:00.398 --> 40:02.484
whatever happened
between me and him in the past...

40:02.567 --> 40:05.737
Yeah. I know.
I get it now.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.325
Because the real problem
was always right here.

40:11.827 --> 40:12.828
Between us.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.750
April, whatever it is you want...

40:21.253 --> 40:22.462
(SIGHS)

40:23.296 --> 40:24.464
(SNIFFLES)

40:25.465 --> 40:26.508
It isn't me.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.552
Ethan, that's not true. What are...

40:28.635 --> 40:30.720
Where are you going?
What are the bags for?

40:30.804 --> 40:33.932
-I'm gonna find a hotel.
-No, Ethan, stop! Listen!

40:34.015 --> 40:35.809
Just take as long as you need
to find a new place.

40:35.892 --> 40:36.893
What? Ethan!

40:46.444 --> 40:47.737
Oh, my God.
