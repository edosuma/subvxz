01:24.417 --> 01:27.054
<i>Cabin crew,
prepare for landing, thank you.</i>

02:35.122 --> 02:37.825
Welcome to Bangkok,
we hope you enjoy your stay.

02:37.859 --> 02:38.926
Mahalo.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.928
Next.

02:50.905 --> 02:54.474
<i>Next station,
Ratchaprarop Station.</i>

07:22.977 --> 07:26.113
Good evening, sir. I hope I
didn't make you wait for too long.

07:26.147 --> 07:29.250
Oh, not at all, you're right on time.
Perfect, actually.

08:43.224 --> 08:45.092
I hope you had a nice nap.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.396
- Water. Ah...

08:49.430 --> 08:51.398
- Thank you
- You're welcome.

08:53.334 --> 08:55.936
You weren't kidding
about the traffic.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.441
Believe it or not,
I was expecting much worse.

09:00.474 --> 09:03.310
We're not too far away now.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.482
Uh... Ahem.

09:09.483 --> 09:10.451
Thank you.

09:10.484 --> 09:13.254
Oh...
Thank you.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.325
Most people would
just toss it to the side.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.496
Most people
are inconsiderate.

09:22.529 --> 09:25.899
This car is spotless.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.335
You must really like this job.

09:28.369 --> 09:30.904
Well, it's decent money.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.207
Plus, I get to choose
my own hours,

09:33.240 --> 09:36.010
and I get to meet
a lot of interesting people.

09:37.111 --> 09:39.179
You like to drive at night?

09:39.213 --> 09:40.914
I have more time at night.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.050
Can't it get dangerous?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.353
Probably, but I've been lucky.

09:46.387 --> 09:48.522
Plus, the app tells me
where I'm being called

09:48.555 --> 09:52.426
and where I'm heading to so,
it's all right.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.429
You're a very pretty woman.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.331
You must get propositioned
all the time.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.467
I'll be worried if they stop.

10:00.501 --> 10:03.103
I'm not getting
any younger, you know.

10:04.505 --> 10:07.141
I take it you're not married?

10:07.174 --> 10:12.346
- No.
- May I ask you... why?

10:13.914 --> 10:17.451
Never got around to it.

10:22.356 --> 10:26.026
I have a brother,
he has MS.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.195
They detected it ten years ago.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.264
He's 25 now.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.034
He's everything to me.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.437
I'm sure he is.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.407
And I'm sure you're doing
everything you can.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.545
I am.

10:45.579 --> 10:48.215
It's just this past year...

10:48.248 --> 10:50.117
It's gotten much worse.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.654
Yeah.

10:53.687 --> 10:57.224
MS can be like that.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.159
A lot of people
who suffer from it

10:59.193 --> 11:02.463
tend to live a lot longer
than they're expected to.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.431
Are you a doctor?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.001
No.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.538
But I was a field medic
a long time ago.

11:11.572 --> 11:15.642
I know a little
about a lot of things.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.312
Jack of all trades, huh?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.581
Master of none, that's right.

11:20.614 --> 11:24.685
- Your English is very good.
- Well, thank you.

11:24.719 --> 11:29.990
I studied English in college,
and that was a long time ago.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.626
Well, I won't
talk about your age

11:32.659 --> 11:34.495
if you don't
talk about my white beard.

11:36.130 --> 11:39.967
I watch a lot of movies as well,
also YouTube videos.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.069
That's how
I practice my English,

11:42.102 --> 11:45.439
but I still feel like
my vocabulary isn't there yet.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.941
Well, you sound great to me.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.177
Besides you're Thai,

11:50.210 --> 11:53.080
you don't need to speak
perfect English.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.016
I'm actually half,
my dad's English.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.052
But I grew up here
and lived here all my life.

12:00.621 --> 12:04.358
Who knows, you know,
maybe one day I'm going to be

12:04.391 --> 12:08.695
living in a country where they only
speak English, and no more Thai.

12:18.372 --> 12:21.975
Well, the office building
is just up ahead.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.977
Can you pull up in the front?

12:24.011 --> 12:25.012
Mm-hm.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.554
All right, we're here.

12:34.655 --> 12:36.457
My name is Kai.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.693
In Hawaiian it means "the sea."

12:39.727 --> 12:43.530
Oh, that's very beautiful.
You're from Hawaii?

12:43.564 --> 12:44.598
Yes.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.467
My name is Fha.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.235
It means "sky" in Thai.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.771
Nice to meet you.

12:49.804 --> 12:52.172
Nice to meet you, Fha.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.443
How's business been tonight?

12:56.477 --> 13:00.013
You're my first customer.
I just started my shift.

13:00.047 --> 13:03.484
- If you don't mind me asking...
- Mm-hm?

13:03.517 --> 13:06.520
How much do you make
on an average Friday night?

13:08.188 --> 13:12.760
I would say 1,500 baht,
and 2,000 on a good night.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.596
Sixty dollars?

13:15.629 --> 13:18.098
Yeah, I think so, yes.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.667
I have an offer for you.

13:22.436 --> 13:25.305
If you decide to take it
you'll have to turn off the app.

13:27.341 --> 13:29.343
Okay.

13:29.376 --> 13:33.614
I have four more stops
after this one, all in the city.

13:37.484 --> 13:42.055
One-thousand dollars,
that's the deposit.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.258
You can quit anytime,
take the money.

13:44.291 --> 13:48.428
But if you decide
to stay with me until the end,

13:48.462 --> 13:50.798
I'll give you $5,000 in cash.

13:52.633 --> 13:56.069
You don't have to do anything.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.573
You don't even have to get out
of the car unless you want to.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.075
I just need you to drive for me.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.717
I need to go up to talk with a lawyer.
Wait for me here.

14:09.751 --> 14:14.321
When I get back,
I'll answer any questions you may have.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.757
All right?

14:17.825 --> 14:19.693
Thank you.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.800
Thank me at the end.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.151
Hello.

15:14.749 --> 15:16.617
Forty-third floor.

15:16.650 --> 15:17.651
Thank you.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.186
You're welcome.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.438
- Good evening, Mr. Kahale.
- Good evening.

15:38.472 --> 15:40.908
- How was your flight?
- It was quick.

15:40.942 --> 15:42.309
That's nice.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.411
Khun Cha Cha is actually
waiting for you.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.416
Thank you.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.485
Welcome to Bangkok,
Mr. Kahale.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.320
Thank you so much,
Khun Cha Cha.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.454
Sorry to keep you waiting.

15:54.488 --> 15:56.456
Not at all.
Please, have a seat.

15:56.490 --> 15:58.492
Thank you.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.827
You have a beautiful office.

15:59.861 --> 16:02.396
Seems like
you've done quite well,

16:02.429 --> 16:03.898
especially for being so young.

16:03.931 --> 16:05.399
Yes, I have.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.268
So, please, tell me.
How I can be of service?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.971
You were a bit vague
on the phone,

16:10.004 --> 16:13.340
something about an accident
and a family member.

16:14.508 --> 16:15.877
Yes.

16:15.910 --> 16:18.813
Actually, more than
just one family member,

16:18.846 --> 16:20.580
the whole family.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.918
Let me show you something.

17:43.097 --> 17:45.867
Thank you, Khun Cha Cha.
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.975
Thank you again for waiting.

17:54.008 --> 17:56.077
Not a problem at all.
Did everything go okay?

17:56.110 --> 17:57.677
- Very well.
- Good.

17:57.712 --> 17:59.013
I'll be back tomorrow
around 4:00 pm

17:59.046 --> 18:00.614
to follow up with details.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.916
All right.

18:01.949 --> 18:03.517
Would you please
do me a small favor?

18:03.550 --> 18:04.551
Of course.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.787
It's a bit unusual.

18:05.820 --> 18:09.056
Uh, can you please
ask for a taxi,

18:09.090 --> 18:11.525
and specifically,
a pink one?

18:11.558 --> 18:13.560
I know it's silly.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.730
But I saw a lot of the
pink taxis at the airport,

18:15.763 --> 18:17.965
and with all my travels
I've never ridden in one.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.901
- Sure, yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

18:19.934 --> 18:22.602
Now, please let them know
there'll be two stops:

18:22.636 --> 18:24.872
one at a 24-hour supermarket,

18:24.906 --> 18:27.374
and then at my hotel,
the Hotel Millennium.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.743
Okay, that's not
a problem at all.

18:28.776 --> 18:30.577
It'll take
maybe about ten minutes.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.113
Would you mind
waiting here? Or...

18:32.146 --> 18:34.347
Uh, actually,
I prefer waiting outside.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.783
- Okay.
- Um, I think my body

18:35.817 --> 18:38.085
could use some fresh
non-airconditioned air.

18:38.119 --> 18:40.487
- Yeah, okay. Great.
- Thank you again.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.889
Have a good evening.

18:50.898 --> 18:52.066
Thank you.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.610
Oh, my gosh, you scared me.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.781
Sorry, you should
lock the doors.

19:06.814 --> 19:09.416
Everything went well?

19:09.449 --> 19:12.385
The lawyer was very cooperative.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.990
Well, I don't like lawyers.

19:16.023 --> 19:19.559
It's okay, I don't either.

19:21.195 --> 19:23.064
So, where next?

19:24.131 --> 19:26.033
Thonglor Police Station,
please.

19:29.737 --> 19:32.940
I know, first a lawyer,
now police.

19:32.974 --> 19:35.910
Mm-hm.
Are you in trouble?

19:37.611 --> 19:39.881
No, it's nothing like that.

19:41.082 --> 19:44.185
The lawyer
and the police officer

19:44.218 --> 19:49.456
were working on a case that involved
my daughter and her family recently.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.392
I'm here to repay them.

19:54.461 --> 19:57.064
We're gonna get there
around 11:00 pm.

19:57.098 --> 19:59.100
Will you be able
to see them then?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.737
I'm sure
that won't be a problem.

21:01.228 --> 21:06.633
Man, you fall asleep so easily.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.703
Every moving vehicle.

21:08.736 --> 21:10.838
I find I like the motion.

21:12.273 --> 21:13.808
What do you like to do?

21:13.841 --> 21:15.710
When you're not...

21:15.743 --> 21:19.512
driving or taking care
of your brother?

21:20.613 --> 21:21.648
I don't know.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.550
I don't really have much time

21:23.583 --> 21:24.986
to do anything else.

21:25.019 --> 21:27.121
You must like something.

21:30.157 --> 21:32.226
Well, what about you?

21:34.627 --> 21:38.165
Fishing.
I like fishing.

21:38.199 --> 21:40.201
- Fishing?
- Fishing.

21:41.302 --> 21:42.970
Fishing sounds so boring.

21:43.004 --> 21:45.538
Have you tried it?

21:45.572 --> 21:49.744
No, but I know what it is,
and it looks boring.

21:52.913 --> 21:54.715
Fish are like people.

21:54.749 --> 21:56.017
Like people?

21:56.050 --> 21:57.517
Like people.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.987
How?

22:00.021 --> 22:02.289
Well, there are some fish

22:02.323 --> 22:09.096
that are... really dumb
and easy to catch.

22:11.198 --> 22:14.667
Others are extremely smart

22:14.702 --> 22:19.106
and much more
difficult to catch.

22:20.607 --> 22:25.578
And then there are the rare,
dangerous ones...

22:25.612 --> 22:29.216
that can hurt
or even kill you.

22:37.725 --> 22:43.097
I actually find it relaxing...
the act of fishing.

22:45.766 --> 22:48.668
I don't really care
whether I catch a fish or not.

22:50.738 --> 22:54.674
I just like
standing on a beach...

22:56.277 --> 22:58.578
watching the waves roll in...

23:00.147 --> 23:02.950
listening to them
crash on the sand...

23:06.087 --> 23:08.856
feeling the warm breeze
on my face...

23:11.425 --> 23:13.227
smelling the salt...

23:15.796 --> 23:18.165
and the scent
of flowers in the air.

23:23.270 --> 23:25.272
That's how I fish.

23:28.042 --> 23:30.311
That's what
my grandfather taught me.

23:33.981 --> 23:35.749
That's what I like.

23:38.185 --> 23:39.920
It's heaven to me.

23:44.992 --> 23:47.228
It sounds very peaceful.

23:49.964 --> 23:51.698
You should try it.

23:54.935 --> 23:56.704
Maybe one day.

24:17.491 --> 24:18.993
We're here.

24:19.026 --> 24:21.095
Do you want me to park in front?

24:21.128 --> 24:23.130
Yeah, park in front.

24:23.164 --> 24:24.398
Okay.

24:38.078 --> 24:39.413
I'll be back soon.

26:17.578 --> 26:19.013
What the fuck?

26:21.215 --> 26:23.183
I know you speak English.

26:23.217 --> 26:25.152
This is for Lisa.

26:25.185 --> 26:27.388
Who the fuck is...

28:33.514 --> 28:35.349
You're still here.

28:38.285 --> 28:42.589
To be honest,
I thought about leaving.

28:44.057 --> 28:46.059
You saw I left the bag.

28:50.330 --> 28:52.099
Did you open it?

28:55.469 --> 28:57.638
But you know
there's cash inside?

29:07.181 --> 29:08.582
Was it a test?

29:10.651 --> 29:13.253
Oh, my God!
What happened to your head?

29:17.257 --> 29:20.728
I tripped.
Hit the wall.

29:39.480 --> 29:43.116
You need stitches,
maybe three or four.

29:43.150 --> 29:45.452
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

29:45.486 --> 29:47.722
Are you sure?
That's a deep cut.

29:48.422 --> 29:49.757
I'm sure.

29:51.124 --> 29:52.993
All right.

29:58.232 --> 29:59.701
Breathe.

30:03.670 --> 30:06.673
And, no, it wasn't a test.

30:12.613 --> 30:15.616
Everything in life
is about making choices.

30:17.351 --> 30:19.486
I chose to leave the bag.

30:20.454 --> 30:22.556
You chose not to take it.

30:25.459 --> 30:27.494
Life is about making choices

30:27.528 --> 30:30.197
and dealing with
those consequences.

30:30.798 --> 30:32.432
You understand that?

30:34.802 --> 30:36.704
I understand.

30:45.379 --> 30:47.080
Are you hungry?

30:47.882 --> 30:49.516
Let's get something to eat.

30:49.550 --> 30:51.285
We have some time.

30:51.318 --> 30:53.220
What do you feel like eating?

30:56.189 --> 30:57.725
Something local.

30:57.759 --> 31:00.060
Well, I know just the place.

31:00.862 --> 31:02.162
Okay.

31:08.302 --> 31:09.670
I mean, come on, babe,

31:09.704 --> 31:12.339
who fucking kills a lawyer
on a Friday night?

31:13.407 --> 31:16.410
Stop it! You're on the scene?

31:16.443 --> 31:19.246
I'm actually
just walking in now.

31:19.279 --> 31:22.215
Kai Kahale, American-Hawaiian.

31:22.249 --> 31:24.886
Just arrived today,
he came straight here.

31:24.919 --> 31:26.286
He had an appointment.

31:27.588 --> 31:28.890
She led him to the vic's office,

31:28.923 --> 31:31.224
next thing you know
he asks for a taxi,

31:31.258 --> 31:34.595
she finds her boss shot dead.
Boom, a bullet to the head.

31:34.628 --> 31:37.397
He walked out of here
as if it was nothing.

31:37.431 --> 31:39.166
Guards confirmed it as well.

31:40.267 --> 31:42.135
Like I said, cold-blooded.

31:43.370 --> 31:45.505
Body slumped over.

31:45.539 --> 31:49.242
<i>Blood splattered everywhere
directly behind her.</i>

31:49.276 --> 31:55.182
This Kai Kahale sat directly
in front of her and shot her.

31:55.215 --> 31:56.583
<i>I'm looking at his ID.</i>

31:56.617 --> 31:58.285
Seems to be real.

31:58.318 --> 32:01.488
Arrived this evening, 5:00 pm,
from Haneda.

32:01.521 --> 32:05.459
<i>TG 614, business class.</i>

32:06.360 --> 32:07.829
Connecting flight.

32:07.862 --> 32:10.597
<i>No alias?</i>

32:10.631 --> 32:15.402
Kai Kahale, born 1954. Retired.

32:15.435 --> 32:19.941
Worked as a supervisor at a coffee
plantation, big one it seems.

32:19.974 --> 32:23.845
He shot her with a silencer,
one shot.

32:23.878 --> 32:27.180
He's definitely
not an office worker.

32:27.214 --> 32:32.219
Get his picture out. Send it out
to the airports and the borders.

32:32.252 --> 32:35.255
Who knows,
maybe we'll get lucky.

32:35.288 --> 32:38.558
All right, get as much
information as you can

32:38.592 --> 32:42.696
and drop me off at the office.
I left my car there.

32:49.511 --> 32:51.305
Uncle, two of the usual, please.

32:51.388 --> 32:52.264
Sure.

32:54.909 --> 32:56.711
What would you
like to drink?

32:56.744 --> 32:59.312
Uh...?

32:59.346 --> 33:00.982
I'd recommend you
the chrysanthemum tea.

33:01.015 --> 33:03.417
It's really refreshing.
Yeah?

33:03.450 --> 33:04.852
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

33:09.489 --> 33:12.201
Uncle,
two chrysanthemum tea, please.

33:12.284 --> 33:13.827
Go ahead.

33:13.911 --> 33:16.079
- Thank you.
- Customer or boyfriend?

33:16.163 --> 33:18.665
- He's a customer.
- That's good.

33:20.292 --> 33:22.138
Because he looks even older than your dad.

33:24.906 --> 33:26.874
Here you go.

33:26.908 --> 33:28.442
Thank you.

33:29.711 --> 33:31.278
You're a regular here?

33:31.311 --> 33:33.246
Yeah, I try to come here

33:33.280 --> 33:35.950
two or three times a week,
depends on my ride.

33:40.021 --> 33:41.555
Good?

33:41.989 --> 33:43.490
Good.

33:45.026 --> 33:47.227
Can I ask you a question now?

33:48.495 --> 33:49.731
Anything.

33:51.431 --> 33:54.534
Six-thousand dollars
is a lot of money,

33:54.568 --> 33:58.940
and anyone would do it
for half or even less.

33:58.973 --> 34:01.675
Probably.

34:01.709 --> 34:04.712
But why 6,000?

34:07.949 --> 34:10.317
Because I wanted you
to say yes.

34:11.318 --> 34:12.585
And I wanted you

34:12.619 --> 34:15.790
to want to do it
and be happy doing it.

34:16.891 --> 34:18.592
Okay...

34:20.360 --> 34:22.897
But to be honest,
I can just take half,

34:22.929 --> 34:23.931
it's more than enough for me.

34:23.965 --> 34:26.433
No, we made a deal,

34:26.466 --> 34:27.969
we shook on it.

34:29.469 --> 34:31.404
Are you sure?

34:31.438 --> 34:32.840
Yes.

34:35.109 --> 34:38.277
Okay. Thank you.

34:39.045 --> 34:40.514
You're welcome.

34:40.547 --> 34:43.784
As I said, thank me after.

34:44.819 --> 34:46.053
After what?

34:53.960 --> 34:55.594
Oh, no, no, wait.

34:55.629 --> 34:58.465
You need to put
some of this in first.

34:58.498 --> 35:00.001
Some nuts.

35:00.034 --> 35:03.971
Some... I don't know what
you call this in English.

35:05.472 --> 35:07.440
But it will make it taste good.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.678
Do you eat chili?

35:11.712 --> 35:12.880
I do.

35:14.481 --> 35:15.582
Thank you.

35:15.615 --> 35:16.818
And then you need this,

35:16.851 --> 35:18.753
this is
like the secret recipe.

35:18.786 --> 35:21.923
- Fish sauce.
- Fish sauce?

35:23.157 --> 35:25.492
Okay, done, dig in.

35:28.896 --> 35:30.430
Bon appétit.

35:30.463 --> 35:32.399
- Bon appétit.
- Merci.

35:34.434 --> 35:36.838
Mmm, smells so good.

35:47.748 --> 35:49.116
It's good, right?

35:50.117 --> 35:51.551
It's really good.

35:51.585 --> 35:53.988
Great.

35:55.156 --> 35:58.458
So, what's after this?

36:01.095 --> 36:02.529
After.

36:05.166 --> 36:07.601
We have a stop at a club.

36:07.634 --> 36:11.172
- Mm-hm.
- Then we go to a hospital.

36:11.205 --> 36:13.440
And the last stop
is at a house.

36:13.473 --> 36:15.743
You're meeting
five people today?

36:16.777 --> 36:19.412
No, seven.

36:22.116 --> 36:24.185
And you want to know why.

36:24.218 --> 36:27.654
Yeah, sorry.

36:28.789 --> 36:31.158
It's okay,
human nature.

36:35.930 --> 36:39.432
Not too long ago...

36:39.466 --> 36:43.536
my daughter and her family
came to Thailand.

36:44.772 --> 36:46.908
They got into an accident.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.678
The people
I'll be seeing tonight

36:51.712 --> 36:53.546
were involved with it.

36:54.681 --> 36:56.017
I see.

36:56.050 --> 36:58.152
Are they okay?

37:00.988 --> 37:02.156
No.

37:04.491 --> 37:05.760
They died.

37:12.599 --> 37:13.834
Oh.

37:15.036 --> 37:18.471
I'm... I'm sorry.

37:21.709 --> 37:23.110
It's okay.

37:43.563 --> 37:46.701
I was recently
in an accident as well.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.543
White family...

37:59.612 --> 38:01.015
They died too.

38:06.020 --> 38:07.822
Drunk driver.

38:11.859 --> 38:14.161
Happens everywhere
in the world.

38:20.067 --> 38:22.169
They have a kid.

38:23.704 --> 38:25.206
A child.

38:41.588 --> 38:42.890
I'm sorry.

39:15.890 --> 39:18.726
Thank you for bringing me here
and for paying for dinner.

39:18.759 --> 39:21.195
- It was excellent.
- You're welcome.

39:21.228 --> 39:25.299
And, uh, I'm sorry about
the not so happy conversation.

39:25.332 --> 39:27.101
It's okay, it's life.

39:29.703 --> 39:30.905
Uh...

39:32.139 --> 39:34.607
Do you know
the Ibiza night club?

39:35.776 --> 39:39.180
Yeah. Is that
our next destination?

39:39.213 --> 39:41.816
- Yes.
- Okay.

40:01.769 --> 40:05.272
A cross, you're not Buddhist?

40:06.673 --> 40:07.908
No.

40:09.143 --> 40:11.078
I'm not Christian either.

40:12.813 --> 40:14.849
Are you atheist?

40:15.749 --> 40:17.751
What's atheist?

40:17.785 --> 40:21.688
Atheist is someone who
does not believe in religion.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.728
I believe in faith.

40:27.761 --> 40:30.731
I believe it's good
that people have faith.

40:30.764 --> 40:32.199
Do you pray?

40:34.001 --> 40:35.269
Yeah.

40:38.239 --> 40:40.374
May I ask to whom?

40:42.877 --> 40:44.644
To my parents.

40:50.951 --> 40:52.987
So why the cross?

40:57.258 --> 40:59.760
It belonged to someone I knew.

41:02.296 --> 41:04.664
I kept it as a reminder.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.702
Good or bad reminder?

41:09.803 --> 41:11.105
Good.

41:12.206 --> 41:14.708
Of something bad I did.

41:16.277 --> 41:18.112
You did something bad?

41:21.415 --> 41:22.783
Yeah.

41:25.319 --> 41:27.154
Did anyone get hurt?

41:28.189 --> 41:29.957
I don't think so.

41:32.393 --> 41:34.128
But you feel bad.

41:36.297 --> 41:38.899
Yeah, I feel...

41:41.468 --> 41:43.737
I... I don't know
how to explain.

41:44.471 --> 41:46.106
Guilt.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.143
You feel guilty.

41:57.551 --> 41:59.353
Guilt is good.

42:01.555 --> 42:04.725
It reminds us to do good.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.128
That's why I kept the cross.

42:37.124 --> 42:39.860
Drive around.
Stay close.

42:39.893 --> 42:42.529
I'll call,
don't pick up the phone.

42:44.098 --> 42:47.001
Meet me over there,
past the entrance,

42:47.034 --> 42:49.203
within five minutes
of the phone call.

42:50.571 --> 42:52.072
Okay.

42:52.973 --> 42:54.108
Okay.

45:27.561 --> 45:29.129
What the fuck, man?

45:29.163 --> 45:30.732
- Dominic!
- Holy fuck!

45:30.765 --> 45:34.535
You messed up.
Stay put.

45:34.568 --> 45:37.304
What... What do you...
What do you want?

45:37.337 --> 45:41.942
You killed a family with your
Porsche, do you remember?

45:45.512 --> 45:46.680
Do you remember?!

45:46.714 --> 45:50.217
Yes, yes, yes, yes...
I... I remember.

45:50.250 --> 45:52.686
Just don't... don't...
don't do anything.

45:54.087 --> 45:56.490
Stand up.

45:56.523 --> 45:59.259
Wait, no, don't...
Just don't kill...

45:59.293 --> 46:01.695
Jesus Christ!

46:01.729 --> 46:04.465
- Stand up!
- Okay... I didn't do anything!

46:08.602 --> 46:10.705
Do you want...
Do you want my car?

46:10.738 --> 46:13.073
Take it, man, it's yours.

47:21.408 --> 47:24.111
- What happened?
- Drive.

47:24.144 --> 47:27.749
- What did you do?
- Drive, please.

47:31.451 --> 47:33.253
Where's the nearest hospital?

47:33.287 --> 47:34.454
Are you hurt?

47:34.488 --> 47:37.090
I'm okay, hospital.

47:37.124 --> 47:38.692
There's one a few minutes away.

47:38.726 --> 47:40.828
Take us there, please.

47:42.195 --> 47:43.697
Please!

48:02.449 --> 48:03.751
What are you thinking?

48:03.785 --> 48:06.353
I'm thinking there's more.

48:06.386 --> 48:10.290
I'm thinking
that it's going to escalate.

48:10.324 --> 48:13.828
And I'm thinking he's not
sleeping in a hotel somewhere.

48:13.861 --> 48:16.129
We need to get everything
on these three people.

48:16.163 --> 48:20.802
Wife's on it.
She should have something for us soon.

48:21.903 --> 48:23.670
Isn't your son like a week old?

48:23.705 --> 48:28.542
- Nine days.
- Talk about a slave driver.

48:28.575 --> 48:30.845
You met my wife, right?

48:31.913 --> 48:34.181
You know she doesn't rest.

48:40.687 --> 48:42.322
Speak.

48:45.525 --> 48:47.661
All right, thanks.

48:48.730 --> 48:50.297
Seems like you're right again.

48:50.330 --> 48:52.666
- Where?
- Ibiza Night Club.

48:52.699 --> 48:54.902
Twenty-three-year-old,
shot through the chest.

48:54.936 --> 48:59.506
- Witness all claim... old Asian man.
- All right.

48:59.539 --> 49:03.210
Wait, boss, there's more.
The kid, he's not dead.

49:03.243 --> 49:05.913
He's being transported
to the hospital as we speak.

49:05.947 --> 49:09.717
You go to the club, get a positive
ID, take a look around,

49:09.751 --> 49:11.518
and I'll head over
to the hospital.

49:11.551 --> 49:12.754
Copy that.

49:20.928 --> 49:23.230
Can I have a tissue, please?

49:30.604 --> 49:32.172
Thank you.

50:13.715 --> 50:15.682
I'm not going to kill you.

50:18.351 --> 50:20.287
Nothing has changed.

50:21.789 --> 50:24.257
Our deal is still the deal.

50:26.460 --> 50:31.498
It wasn't an accident, right,
me picking you up tonight?

50:34.468 --> 50:36.771
No, it wasn't.

50:39.073 --> 50:40.942
I know where you live.

50:42.944 --> 50:44.544
I knew your routine.

50:50.617 --> 50:52.252
Why?

50:58.826 --> 51:01.261
The family that died
in your car...

51:04.331 --> 51:06.566
that was my daughter...

51:08.770 --> 51:10.370
her husband...

51:13.340 --> 51:17.377
and her five-year-old daughter.

51:20.848 --> 51:22.649
My grandchild.

51:35.997 --> 51:38.365
You gonna kill me?

51:45.840 --> 51:50.410
It was possible... yes.

51:52.146 --> 51:56.650
It was your car, your signature
on the witness sheet.

52:06.060 --> 52:12.033
I swear,
I don't want to kill you.

52:12.066 --> 52:14.334
I don't even want to hurt you.

52:19.606 --> 52:22.342
Can you give me
a bottle of water, please?

52:35.455 --> 52:36.656
Thank you.

52:41.863 --> 52:43.130
Drink it.

52:57.510 --> 52:59.546
What changed your mind?

53:03.650 --> 53:04.886
That.

53:12.659 --> 53:16.630
I gave that to my daughter...

53:24.805 --> 53:26.774
on her 18th birthday.

53:59.874 --> 54:05.046
Anyone who can live
with as much guilt as you do...

54:07.982 --> 54:10.117
over making a choice...

54:10.985 --> 54:12.954
You had no option.

54:15.723 --> 54:20.795
That person has a good heart.

54:52.793 --> 54:54.494
You're going to kill him?

55:00.034 --> 55:01.534
Yes.

55:31.032 --> 55:33.600
What kind
of fucking place is this?

55:35.069 --> 55:38.072
- Is this you?
- What the fuck do you mean?

55:38.105 --> 55:39.907
Is this one of
your business associates?

55:39.940 --> 55:41.842
Did you have
some sort of deal go bad?

55:41.876 --> 55:43.310
Fuck you!

55:43.344 --> 55:45.645
Fuck you for even thinking that.

55:45.678 --> 55:47.081
How can I not think it?

55:47.114 --> 55:49.616
How many times
have you put us in danger?

55:49.649 --> 55:51.252
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:51.285 --> 55:54.055
How many times
have you been shot at?

55:55.089 --> 55:56.957
How many times has Dom?

55:59.093 --> 56:02.763
That's right, none.

56:02.797 --> 56:04.932
I have never put us in danger.

56:06.967 --> 56:09.669
The life I provide you with,

56:09.703 --> 56:13.240
ninety-nine percent of the
population would kill for.

56:14.375 --> 56:17.178
So, I would appreciate
some respect!

56:19.713 --> 56:25.086
The fact that I let you fuck your
little hussies is respect enough.

56:25.119 --> 56:28.155
What, you think I don't know?

56:28.189 --> 56:30.958
You think I'm some <i>farang</i>
who's blind

56:30.991 --> 56:32.393
and doesn't know
what's going on?

56:32.426 --> 56:38.165
Nothing you do goes by me.

56:38.199 --> 56:40.034
I can take my son

56:40.067 --> 56:44.205
and walk away
with everything you got.

56:44.238 --> 56:47.808
I know all
your dirty little secrets.

56:47.842 --> 56:50.744
So the fact
that I'm still standing here,

56:50.778 --> 56:53.247
that's all the respect
you're going to get.

56:55.082 --> 57:00.421
And if my son dies...
I swear to God,

57:00.454 --> 57:04.758
you'll regret the day
that you ever laid eyes on me.

58:57.271 --> 58:58.906
He's a lucky boy.

59:00.474 --> 59:03.444
The bullet went clean through.

59:03.477 --> 59:06.213
All they had to do was clean
his wounds and stitch him up.

59:07.948 --> 59:09.350
He's gonna be okay.

59:26.033 --> 59:30.371
You're fired...
useless piece of shit!

59:33.540 --> 59:36.377
You fucking shot my son?!

59:37.878 --> 59:42.216
Wait, wait, wait!
What is this all about?

59:42.249 --> 59:46.020
Listen, anything you want.
I have so much money.

59:49.523 --> 59:53.827
Your money paid for everything.

59:55.929 --> 59:58.432
Made my son-in-law
into a criminal.

59:59.933 --> 01:00:02.102
You covered your son's crimes!

01:00:04.171 --> 01:00:08.175
Yeah, you understand now.

01:00:10.577 --> 01:00:13.580
I did it to protect my son.

01:00:13.614 --> 01:00:15.916
Something any father would do.

01:00:20.287 --> 01:00:21.388
Me too.

01:00:27.361 --> 01:00:29.963
The apple never falls
far from the tree.

01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:33.334
He's just a kid.

01:00:59.526 --> 01:01:05.332
You're old enough to kill...
you're old enough to die

01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:45.172
Well, what do you got?

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:47.474
<i>Hurt boobies.</i>

01:01:47.508 --> 01:01:49.309
Like father, like son.

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:56.150
I found connections between the cops
and the lawyers in over 20 cases.

01:01:56.183 --> 01:02:00.988
From small traffic violations
to more serious crimes.

01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:02.489
Example?

01:02:02.523 --> 01:02:04.491
<i>Drug and human trafficking,
possession.</i>

01:02:04.525 --> 01:02:07.127
<i>You name it,
they worked on it together.</i>

01:02:07.161 --> 01:02:10.364
And for every instance
the defendants walked.

01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:13.567
<i>There was only one case involving
the Davis family though.</i>

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.005
- Okay.
- A few months ago, the son was involved in an accident.

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:20.541
Four people died
and one was injured,

01:02:20.574 --> 01:02:24.378
including a five-year-old girl.
A British family.

01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:27.281
- Not American?
- <i>No, British.</i>

01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:30.484
- The Coopers.
- And the son got acquitted.

01:02:30.517 --> 01:02:34.388
Turns out the husband
was the one driving the taxi.

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:39.159
Paid the driver extra,
said he always wanted to drive in Bangkok.

01:02:39.193 --> 01:02:42.696
Got confused,
drove right onto coming traffic.

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:45.132
And ran directly into the son.

01:02:45.165 --> 01:02:47.735
<i>Yeah,
that's the official version.</i>

01:02:47.769 --> 01:02:50.604
No, thanks to our
two dead friends, I'm sure.

01:02:50.637 --> 01:02:52.105
Right.

01:02:53.507 --> 01:02:55.242
Your thoughts?

01:02:55.275 --> 01:02:58.312
<i>My thoughts are the same,
the law is the law.</i>

01:02:58.345 --> 01:03:01.014
Vigilante justice
is still homicide.

01:03:11.793 --> 01:03:13.360
Drop it!

01:03:15.596 --> 01:03:16.731
Now!

01:03:19.533 --> 01:03:22.737
Okay, man, relax.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:25.372
I'm putting down the gun.

01:03:30.778 --> 01:03:32.714
Look, I know everything.

01:03:32.747 --> 01:03:35.349
The son, he killed
your family, right?

01:03:37.184 --> 01:03:38.652
Son or daughter?

01:03:42.422 --> 01:03:44.024
My daughter.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:49.463
I understand, but no one
needs to get hurt anymore.

01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:53.433
Oh, yes, one more person,
then it's done.

01:03:53.467 --> 01:03:57.304
The only person
that is gonna get hurt is you.

01:03:58.138 --> 01:04:00.274
If you continue this.

01:04:00.307 --> 01:04:01.809
Put down the gun.

01:04:01.843 --> 01:04:05.245
Come on, man,
let's handle this the right way.

01:04:05.279 --> 01:04:06.513
The legal way.

01:04:06.547 --> 01:04:08.315
Yeah, that didn't
work out too well

01:04:08.348 --> 01:04:10.284
for my daughter and her family.

01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:13.287
<i>And that's on us,
and I apologize.</i>

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.822
But there's
good and bad everywhere.

01:04:14.856 --> 01:04:18.225
- Yeah.
- They were bad people

01:04:18.258 --> 01:04:19.794
pretending to be good.

01:04:19.827 --> 01:04:21.628
You are good doing bad,

01:04:21.662 --> 01:04:23.363
and two wrongs
don't make it right, man.

01:04:23.397 --> 01:04:25.399
Nothing will make this right,
not even this.

01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:28.235
- So why are we doing this?
- Because I can.

01:04:28.268 --> 01:04:30.671
Because no one else did.

01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:35.509
Don't.

01:04:36.711 --> 01:04:38.178
I don't want to shoot you,

01:04:38.211 --> 01:04:40.514
I don't want to shoot her,
but I will.

01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:42.082
Stay there.

01:04:50.524 --> 01:04:52.326
Go, go, go!

01:04:52.359 --> 01:04:53.560
Go.

01:04:59.566 --> 01:05:00.735
No!

01:05:00.768 --> 01:05:02.336
Kai!

01:05:02.369 --> 01:05:05.305
No, fuckin' stay there!

01:05:05.339 --> 01:05:06.841
Kai, you're not
gonna shoot me.

01:05:06.874 --> 01:05:09.142
- I will shoot you!
- Let her go.

01:05:09.176 --> 01:05:11.746
I'm not letting her go.
I'm not letting her go!

01:05:11.779 --> 01:05:13.915
Kai, please let her go,
she didn't do anything.

01:05:13.948 --> 01:05:17.150
- I don't want to hurt her!
- I don't have a gun.

01:05:17.184 --> 01:05:18.820
Kai, calm down.
That's not you,

01:05:18.853 --> 01:05:20.554
you're not that type of man.

01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:23.290
- They're already dead.
- Stay there!

01:05:23.323 --> 01:05:27.227
Kai, they're all dead.
Let her go, please.

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.897
- I'm begging you.
- I'm gonna shoot you.

01:05:29.931 --> 01:05:31.833
I'm gonna shoot you.

01:05:31.866 --> 01:05:33.166
I'll shoot you.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.202
Kai, let her go!

01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:36.938
You want to shoot me,
then shoot me!

01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:39.172
But you fucking let her go now!

01:05:39.206 --> 01:05:41.475
That's not you, Kai!

01:05:41.508 --> 01:05:44.277
Let her go!
Okay?

01:05:44.311 --> 01:05:47.381
I'm a father, just like you.

01:05:47.414 --> 01:05:50.217
Just like you,
I'm a father, I understand,

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:54.454
but please, just let her go.
Please.

01:05:54.488 --> 01:05:58.291
Kai... Kai, listen to me.

01:05:59.961 --> 01:06:01.528
Let her go.

01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:14.541
No!

01:06:15.743 --> 01:06:19.446
That's on you!
That's on you!

01:06:22.784 --> 01:06:24.317
No!

01:06:25.787 --> 01:06:29.322
Help! Help me!

01:06:29.356 --> 01:06:31.625
Officer down! Two down!

01:06:31.658 --> 01:06:33.928
Come on, bro, hang in there,
hang in there.

01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:36.731
I didn't kill her, right?

01:06:36.764 --> 01:06:40.001
No, you didn't, she's good.
She's going to make it. Okay.

01:06:57.752 --> 01:06:59.653
Fuck!

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.728
Fuck.

01:09:14.188 --> 01:09:16.157
This is a surprise.

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:17.657
Where are you?

01:09:18.491 --> 01:09:19.827
I don't know.

01:09:19.861 --> 01:09:22.129
<i>There are cops everywhere.</i>

01:09:22.964 --> 01:09:24.631
Yeah, I know.

01:09:24.663 --> 01:09:27.935
Didn't go quite as well
as planned.

01:09:28.935 --> 01:09:30.104
Send me your location.

01:09:30.136 --> 01:09:33.506
They don't know my car,
I'm close.

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.942
<i>I'll come pick you up.</i>

01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:39.981
All right.

01:09:40.014 --> 01:09:42.183
Park in the alley.

01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:44.085
I'll see you when you pull up.

01:10:28.162 --> 01:10:29.864
Stay low.

01:10:45.512 --> 01:10:48.515
Thank you.

01:10:54.021 --> 01:10:55.823
Where are we going?

01:10:55.856 --> 01:10:58.092
You're bleeding,
we need to fix you.

01:10:59.693 --> 01:11:01.494
I'm fine.

01:11:04.231 --> 01:11:06.200
Bullet went through.

01:11:06.233 --> 01:11:09.770
- How do you know?
- I felt it.

01:11:09.804 --> 01:11:12.472
But I can't go to a hospital.

01:11:13.274 --> 01:11:14.909
I'm serious.

01:11:14.942 --> 01:11:19.714
The detective, he's good.
It won't take him long

01:11:19.747 --> 01:11:21.949
before he figure's out
who the last target is.

01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:25.720
And the last target himself...

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:27.822
He's gonna know what's
going on in the next hour...

01:11:28.823 --> 01:11:30.157
and disappear.

01:11:31.859 --> 01:11:34.996
We're not going to the hospital,
don't worry.

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:36.864
It's not too far away.

01:11:56.275 --> 01:11:57.484
Thank you.

01:12:19.672 --> 01:12:21.142
How are you holding up?

01:12:24.245 --> 01:12:25.612
Better.

01:12:32.053 --> 01:12:33.721
You did your best.

01:12:34.722 --> 01:12:36.057
I heard everything.

01:12:37.725 --> 01:12:39.894
Kid was 29.

01:12:41.929 --> 01:12:44.031
He shot a nurse.

01:12:44.932 --> 01:12:46.867
She was 24.

01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:54.607
He's not a kid.

01:12:56.077 --> 01:12:57.912
There's another target.

01:13:00.014 --> 01:13:01.782
I know.

01:13:01.816 --> 01:13:03.150
That's why I'm here.

01:13:06.253 --> 01:13:08.289
You remember the accident?

01:13:08.322 --> 01:13:10.891
There was one person
who was injured.

01:13:10.925 --> 01:13:12.993
Didn't die.

01:13:13.027 --> 01:13:15.796
Her name was Vanida Hoffsted.

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:18.132
She was a cab driver.

01:13:18.165 --> 01:13:20.633
The girl that testified
at the trial.

01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:21.702
Yeah.

01:13:22.703 --> 01:13:24.105
Earlier tonight,

01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:28.275
she picked up someone
from On Nut Road around 8:00 pm.

01:13:28.309 --> 01:13:33.646
Two hours later,
dropped him off on Silom Road.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.648
Near the law offices?

01:13:37.985 --> 01:13:40.154
Well, where is she now?

01:13:40.187 --> 01:13:42.389
She turned her app off
after that.

01:13:42.423 --> 01:13:45.860
She was driving a new Volvo.
I have the plates.

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:47.660
We can track her.

01:13:47.694 --> 01:13:49.964
It'll show up
if she's on the road.

01:13:49.997 --> 01:13:53.734
- Put everything on it.
- I already ordered it.

01:13:54.869 --> 01:13:56.303
Of course you did, babe.

01:14:00.007 --> 01:14:02.810
- You saw the photos.
- Stop.

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:06.646
I know you're
a good-hearted person...

01:14:08.015 --> 01:14:10.117
but he's still
a cold-blooded murderer.

01:14:11.118 --> 01:14:13.120
He never was one.

01:14:13.154 --> 01:14:16.857
He served in the military;
two tours, 40 years ago.

01:14:18.025 --> 01:14:21.829
After that,
not even a single blemish.

01:14:21.862 --> 01:14:26.000
- Not even a traffic violation.
- He's still a murderer.

01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:29.870
He's also a father.

01:14:29.904 --> 01:14:31.671
Just like you.

01:14:33.841 --> 01:14:36.911
What are you trying to say,
I should just drop everything?

01:14:36.944 --> 01:14:40.314
No, but I know you.

01:14:40.347 --> 01:14:43.951
You just watched your young
partner get shot and die.

01:14:43.984 --> 01:14:47.221
You're operating
on emotions right now.

01:14:47.254 --> 01:14:50.824
I'm just here
to give you some balance.

01:14:55.129 --> 01:14:59.266
You're a good man, like him.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:02.069
I don't want to see you
do a bad thing.

01:15:03.103 --> 01:15:05.206
Two wrongs don't make a right.

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:08.809
I gotta go work.

01:15:14.415 --> 01:15:15.482
Look at him.

01:15:21.222 --> 01:15:22.856
Now look at me.

01:15:26.227 --> 01:15:28.295
You're a good cop, babe.

01:15:29.997 --> 01:15:35.336
But remember, you're a father
now, first and foremost.

01:15:35.369 --> 01:15:38.405
Then a husband, then a cop.

01:15:44.345 --> 01:15:47.214
- I love you.
- Ditto.

01:16:19.346 --> 01:16:21.081
Oh, my God.

01:16:44.238 --> 01:16:46.106
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:16:47.474 --> 01:16:50.477
Uh, do you have
some saline or some alcohol

01:16:50.511 --> 01:16:52.046
- or something first?
- Oh, right, yes.

01:16:52.079 --> 01:16:53.447
Oh, fuck.

01:16:55.082 --> 01:16:57.451
- All right. Oh, thanks.
- Sorry.

01:16:59.219 --> 01:17:01.889
Oh, my gosh,
that's a lot of blood.

01:17:12.599 --> 01:17:14.001
Okay...

01:17:19.006 --> 01:17:20.541
Are you ready?

01:17:21.475 --> 01:17:23.310
Okay, this is gonna hurt.

01:17:48.936 --> 01:17:50.537
Why'd you come back?

01:17:52.473 --> 01:17:54.041
Sorry.

01:18:05.018 --> 01:18:07.988
I had a chance to correct
the wrong that I did.

01:18:09.957 --> 01:18:11.892
So I made a choice.

01:18:16.263 --> 01:18:20.067
You said we live with the
consequences of our own choice.

01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:24.338
I made a bad one before.

01:18:27.274 --> 01:18:29.410
You didn't have a choice.

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:31.979
I know that now.

01:18:35.249 --> 01:18:36.383
Ow.

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:39.219
Okay.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:51.365
They gave me two million baht...
and this car.

01:18:57.404 --> 01:19:00.641
They told me to say that I
wasn't the one who was driving.

01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:05.479
That our car hit the other car.

01:19:10.217 --> 01:19:12.352
If I didn't take the offer...

01:19:13.721 --> 01:19:16.190
I believe that they were
probably going to kill me.

01:19:18.492 --> 01:19:19.626
Yes.

01:19:20.661 --> 01:19:22.196
They would have.

01:19:24.097 --> 01:19:27.000
I spent most of my money
on my brother.

01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:31.605
Paid in advance
for his hospital expenses.

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:35.008
There's not much left now.

01:19:41.081 --> 01:19:44.351
Well, turn around,
you've got one more to go.

01:19:54.261 --> 01:19:55.429
Ooh.

01:19:57.464 --> 01:19:59.266
This is gonna hurt more.

01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:10.778
All right, last one.
Take a deep breath.

01:20:19.787 --> 01:20:21.255
Thank you.

01:20:22.589 --> 01:20:24.625
It's gonna leave a big scar.

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.662
It's okay.
It's a good reminder.

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:31.265
Of what, tonight?

01:20:32.432 --> 01:20:34.401
Of you.

01:20:34.434 --> 01:20:36.303
Jack of all trades.

01:20:45.178 --> 01:20:48.248
I actually have one more reason
why I came back.

01:21:00.193 --> 01:21:02.529
I started driving two years ago.

01:21:04.398 --> 01:21:08.235
Before this, I used to work
in hotels and restaurants.

01:21:11.806 --> 01:21:14.608
I meet a lot of foreigners
everywhere I work.

01:21:16.778 --> 01:21:22.717
All the foreigners,
they see me, they like me.

01:21:24.819 --> 01:21:27.621
They offered money
for me to sleep with them.

01:21:31.859 --> 01:21:33.560
But I'd never take it.

01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:37.631
You understand?

01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:50.444
You're the first man
that I've met... in my life

01:21:51.578 --> 01:21:53.347
that showed me respect.

01:21:55.649 --> 01:21:59.386
Who actually gave me
respect for what I do.

01:22:00.253 --> 01:22:01.655
My work.

01:22:01.688 --> 01:22:04.124
Not for what I look like.

01:22:11.231 --> 01:22:13.200
That's why I came back.

01:22:22.242 --> 01:22:26.914
That's the nicest thing anyone
has said to me since... my wife.

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:31.786
It's the truth.

01:22:33.888 --> 01:22:35.522
Makes it nicer.

01:22:40.795 --> 01:22:42.262
Stay here.

01:22:54.574 --> 01:22:55.710
Hold this.

01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:02.516
There's $4,000 cash
in this bag.

01:23:04.752 --> 01:23:06.253
It's yours.

01:23:07.889 --> 01:23:09.589
Do you know Bitcoin?

01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:12.592
Bit... coin.

01:23:12.626 --> 01:23:15.228
Yeah, I think so.

01:23:15.262 --> 01:23:16.898
You know it's money?

01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:19.232
Like electronic money.

01:23:19.266 --> 01:23:22.436
I read something online,
but I'm not sure.

01:23:22.469 --> 01:23:25.940
Okay, it's not hard
to find out about.

01:23:25.973 --> 01:23:29.309
Inside that bag
is a hard drive.

01:23:30.912 --> 01:23:33.480
My life savings.

01:23:33.513 --> 01:23:37.517
One-million, three-hundred and
eighty-nine thousand dollars.

01:23:39.921 --> 01:23:41.555
It's yours.

01:23:43.024 --> 01:23:44.959
No, no, no, no,
I cannot take this.

01:23:44.992 --> 01:23:46.426
- No, no, no. Listen to me.
- No, no, I cannot.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:48.295
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- No.

01:23:48.328 --> 01:23:50.798
I converted it to bitcoin.

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:53.701
I didn't know what else to do.

01:23:53.735 --> 01:23:55.602
Uh, I was thinking, maybe,

01:23:55.635 --> 01:23:58.405
I could donate it
to charity afterwards,

01:23:58.438 --> 01:24:01.675
but there is no
afterwards for me.

01:24:02.944 --> 01:24:04.678
What do you mean?

01:24:06.413 --> 01:24:10.785
I mean, the last guy
is different from the others.

01:24:10.818 --> 01:24:13.320
He's much more dangerous.

01:24:13.353 --> 01:24:14.621
Much smarter.

01:24:14.654 --> 01:24:17.058
Better guarded.

01:24:17.091 --> 01:24:19.459
So you think you cannot win?

01:24:21.495 --> 01:24:23.630
It was never about
winning for me.

01:24:24.899 --> 01:24:29.669
Even if I survive,
I'll go to prison.

01:24:29.704 --> 01:24:31.605
I should go to prison.

01:24:32.907 --> 01:24:34.976
But I can't go there,
you understand?

01:24:41.048 --> 01:24:42.817
I understand.

01:24:46.087 --> 01:24:49.322
So you must take this.

01:24:50.825 --> 01:24:55.362
Because if you take this,
you win.

01:24:56.496 --> 01:24:59.666
And if you win, I win.

01:25:01.702 --> 01:25:06.540
You take your brother
and you get some passports.

01:25:06.573 --> 01:25:10.111
And you take him to some country
that doesn't speak Thai,

01:25:10.144 --> 01:25:12.312
if that's what you really want.

01:25:14.481 --> 01:25:15.615
Okay?

01:25:18.418 --> 01:25:19.686
Okay.

01:25:33.734 --> 01:25:35.002
Thank you.

01:25:41.142 --> 01:25:42.642
You're welcome.

01:26:02.462 --> 01:26:03.865
Who is this man?

01:26:06.734 --> 01:26:08.535
He's Japanese.

01:26:09.804 --> 01:26:13.373
- Like Yakuza?
- No.

01:26:14.175 --> 01:26:15.776
But he works with them.

01:26:17.544 --> 01:26:19.914
He works with anyone
who can pay his price.

01:26:19.947 --> 01:26:23.450
Which is... very high.

01:26:23.483 --> 01:26:24.819
To do what?

01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:28.521
To solve problems.

01:26:29.724 --> 01:26:30.992
Like?

01:26:32.059 --> 01:26:35.730
Like, if you kill someone

01:26:35.763 --> 01:26:37.965
and you need to
get rid of the body.

01:26:37.999 --> 01:26:42.737
If you get arrested for drunk
driving, killing a family...

01:26:43.704 --> 01:26:45.538
he can fix it.

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:51.078
He's a really bad man then.

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.715
One of the worst.

01:26:54.749 --> 01:26:58.485
A type of person who can do
a lot of bad things

01:26:58.518 --> 01:27:00.955
and not get dirty for it.

01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:05.126
Well, you seem to know
a lot about him.

01:27:10.664 --> 01:27:12.033
I hired him.

01:27:13.167 --> 01:27:15.002
What?

01:27:15.036 --> 01:27:16.636
He arranged everything for me.

01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:21.441
The bag, the gun,
the phone, everything.

01:27:23.543 --> 01:27:28.548
Oh, well,
you're really smart, Mr. Kai.

01:29:27.268 --> 01:29:31.038
Don't go.
Make a choice.

01:29:32.973 --> 01:29:35.608
Take me and my brother
to Hawaii.

01:29:39.046 --> 01:29:40.680
We can go fishing.

01:29:46.187 --> 01:29:47.988
That would be nice.

01:29:49.423 --> 01:29:53.894
<i>Fishing with you...
and your brother.</i>

01:30:03.304 --> 01:30:04.772
Good luck...

01:30:08.142 --> 01:30:09.743
Khun Fha.

01:32:14.435 --> 01:32:15.936
Hey!

01:32:19.139 --> 01:32:21.508
Hey, you motherfucker!

01:32:23.043 --> 01:32:25.112
You got all these guys
fighting for you,

01:32:25.145 --> 01:32:27.081
you can't do it yourself?

01:32:27.848 --> 01:32:30.818
Huh? One guy.

01:32:30.851 --> 01:32:33.020
One guy!

01:32:33.053 --> 01:32:37.191
Huh? You fucker!
Come out!

01:32:37.224 --> 01:32:38.759
Come out!

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.363
You, deal with me, old man!

01:32:42.396 --> 01:32:43.931
Tough guy!

01:32:43.964 --> 01:32:45.966
Come here, fuck head!

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.101
Huh?

01:32:48.168 --> 01:32:49.803
You want me to come inside?

01:32:49.837 --> 01:32:52.773
I'll fucking come inside.
I'll find you.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.188
Hold on a second.

01:33:15.129 --> 01:33:17.264
You're really aggressive.

01:33:17.298 --> 01:33:19.133
You've got nice hair.

01:33:21.201 --> 01:33:25.105
I admire you, I really do.

01:33:25.139 --> 01:33:27.374
You know, it's impressive
what you've done here tonight.

01:33:27.408 --> 01:33:29.476
Well, I'm not finished yet.

01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:31.812
And I'm only getting started.

01:33:34.381 --> 01:33:35.849
As you know,
I don't usually

01:33:35.883 --> 01:33:38.552
involve myself personally
in anything.

01:33:38.585 --> 01:33:42.456
I like to manipulate things.

01:33:43.657 --> 01:33:45.592
But I'm really gonna
enjoy this.

01:33:48.595 --> 01:33:51.498
It's been a long time
since I killed anyone.

01:34:04.044 --> 01:34:06.613
You shot a 22-year-old boy.

01:34:08.148 --> 01:34:09.883
That's cold-blooded, dude.

01:34:09.917 --> 01:34:16.623
Yeah, well... I'm not done yet.

01:34:16.657 --> 01:34:20.227
You Hawaiian man.

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.863
They certainly don't
make 'em like you anymore.

01:34:24.531 --> 01:34:27.234
You're pissed at me because
I helped some rich parents

01:34:27.267 --> 01:34:29.269
get their son off.

01:34:29.303 --> 01:34:31.004
I didn't kill your family.

01:34:31.038 --> 01:34:33.307
They'd be dead
if I stepped in or not.

01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:36.276
So is this all worth it?

01:34:39.046 --> 01:34:40.414
Yeah.

01:34:41.215 --> 01:34:42.583
It's worth it.

01:34:43.484 --> 01:34:44.918
Maybe.

01:34:46.387 --> 01:34:48.122
I took my shot.

01:34:51.225 --> 01:34:52.626
Now you take yours.

01:35:28.162 --> 01:35:29.530
Come on!

01:35:42.609 --> 01:35:45.078
Ow, fuck!

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.048
Shit.

01:35:50.551 --> 01:35:52.152
Goddamn.

01:35:54.288 --> 01:35:55.622
Kai!

01:35:59.326 --> 01:36:01.261
I should just shoot you.

01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:03.297
Kai, Kai...

01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:05.666
It's me.

01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:09.102
Who the fuck are you?

01:36:09.737 --> 01:36:11.538
Who the fuck are you?

01:36:14.241 --> 01:36:16.610
You're the cab driver.

01:36:16.643 --> 01:36:18.713
She's not involved.

01:36:21.081 --> 01:36:23.584
Wait, you actually
care about her?

01:36:23.617 --> 01:36:25.285
She took bribe money.

01:36:25.319 --> 01:36:29.623
Yeah, you didn't
give her a choice.

01:36:29.656 --> 01:36:33.260
True. Details.

01:36:34.495 --> 01:36:36.129
Let her go.

01:36:36.163 --> 01:36:38.733
How the fuck
are you still standing?

01:36:39.701 --> 01:36:41.235
Please...

01:36:42.302 --> 01:36:43.604
let her go.

01:36:48.375 --> 01:36:50.143
I'm gonna have to say no.

01:36:51.445 --> 01:36:54.248
But I'm gonna be a nice guy.

01:36:54.281 --> 01:36:59.353
I'm gonna give you a choice.
Who do I shoot first?

01:37:10.364 --> 01:37:11.698
Sorry.

01:37:14.334 --> 01:37:15.770
Me too.

01:37:24.378 --> 01:37:25.512
Her.

01:37:28.215 --> 01:37:30.250
Wise choice.

01:37:52.639 --> 01:37:54.374
Is this on me too?

01:37:57.177 --> 01:37:59.112
I'm sorry about the cop.

01:38:01.214 --> 01:38:02.817
And the nurse.

01:38:06.687 --> 01:38:11.091
She has all the evidence
to clear my family's name.

01:38:11.859 --> 01:38:13.360
Please, do it.

01:38:17.765 --> 01:38:19.600
I held her hostage.

01:38:20.935 --> 01:38:23.136
I threatened her brother.

01:38:24.839 --> 01:38:26.808
I forced her into this.

01:38:30.677 --> 01:38:32.546
Please, call an ambulance.

01:38:34.247 --> 01:38:35.549
I already have.

01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:37.684
I'm dead.

01:38:39.252 --> 01:38:40.487
You know that.

01:38:44.959 --> 01:38:46.693
I know I don't deserve it...

01:38:48.462 --> 01:38:50.364
but I have a request.

01:39:31.005 --> 01:39:32.539
Thank you.
