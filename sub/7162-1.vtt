00:07.247 --> 00:08.726
So your son made it.

00:08.887 --> 00:10.878
Getting into
such a top school!

00:11.247 --> 00:12.726
You must be relieved.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.525
Your firm
has a future now.

00:14.687 --> 00:16.006
My son's
aiming higher.

00:16.367 --> 00:18.642
Contracting is fine for my husband.

00:18.807 --> 00:19.922
Some Bastille Day!

00:20.127 --> 00:21.879
The fireworks will be great!

00:22.047 --> 00:24.003
- Same school?
- l'm doing Lit.

00:24.207 --> 00:25.640
Agnes is at Normale Sup.

00:25.807 --> 00:28.002
You're a human rights activist?

00:28.167 --> 00:29.236
Excuse us.

00:29.407 --> 00:32.284
Why not? l work
for animal rights, myself.

00:32.447 --> 00:35.405
- Know when the fireworks start?
- No idea.

00:35.567 --> 00:38.001
- Would you know?
- Yes, right now.

00:41.807 --> 00:45.595
That how you passed the entrance
exams? Congratulations!

00:45.767 --> 00:47.280
You studied with him?

00:47.807 --> 00:50.002
You're not rooming with him!

00:50.167 --> 00:51.725
Him or another. We have to.

00:51.887 --> 00:54.321
lt's regulations.
We're three to a flat.

00:54.487 --> 00:55.966
Who's forcing you to?

00:56.127 --> 00:58.880
You can share
my Paris studio with me.

00:59.047 --> 01:00.719
And spend two hours commuting?

01:01.807 --> 01:04.321
Relax.
We'll see a lot of each other.

01:04.887 --> 01:06.206
l live on campus.

01:06.407 --> 01:09.285
lt promotes competitive spirit.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.967 --> 01:33.798
Mine wasn't bad either.

01:35.687 --> 01:37.723
Have you seen Paul?

02:44.407 --> 02:47.365
You can't live here, baby.
lt's gloomy.

02:50.447 --> 02:54.565
When did they
last redecorate... 1950?

02:55.807 --> 02:59.402
Relax, Mom.
They want to keep us on campus.

03:00.087 --> 03:02.203
But that's no reason, baby.

03:02.487 --> 03:04.205
Don't call me that.

03:12.527 --> 03:14.757
- Louis-Arnault Réal.
- Paul Thabor.

03:16.247 --> 03:17.680
Bernard Chouquet.

03:20.607 --> 03:23.724
l took the big bedroom.
First come, first served.

03:23.887 --> 03:26.879
Excuse me,
but did your parents see

03:27.047 --> 03:30.357
how noisy the big bedroom is?

03:31.087 --> 03:32.645
lt's none of their concern.

03:32.807 --> 03:37.085
lt should be. You won't get any rest
with all that noise.

03:37.687 --> 03:40.121
But as for my Bernard,

03:40.287 --> 03:44.439
the noise of traffic and drills
lull him to sleep.

03:44.607 --> 03:47.724
The other room is fine.
l'm not taking his.

03:50.407 --> 03:52.318
- We have no choice.
- Trust me.

03:52.487 --> 03:54.842
All the campus apartments
are the same.

03:55.007 --> 03:57.077
- Think it over.
- Please, Mom!

04:01.327 --> 04:02.237
What's going on?

04:02.407 --> 04:05.797
She thinks the flat's
not good enough for him.

04:05.967 --> 04:08.322
- Oh, no? Where's he from?
- L'lsle en Dodon.

04:09.047 --> 04:10.480
ln the southwest.

04:10.727 --> 04:13.878
l see. The roommate situation
looks promising.

04:14.047 --> 04:15.719
l don't mean you.

04:16.406 --> 04:17.635
Then again...

04:18.487 --> 04:20.045
Just kidding.

04:27.247 --> 04:28.680
Here they are.

04:29.807 --> 04:31.957
Paul Thabor. Bernard Chouquet.

04:32.127 --> 04:34.118
Emeline Dejour, my girlfriend.

04:35.207 --> 04:39.325
How convenient to have your
girlfriend in the same school!

04:39.927 --> 04:41.121
Let's go.

04:44.287 --> 04:45.402
My dear friends,

04:45.607 --> 04:49.680
don't be surprised to hear
that word in my mouth.

04:49.887 --> 04:53.436
l'm more than your academic dean.

04:53.607 --> 04:56.565
l want to be the go-between
who helps you

04:56.727 --> 05:01.118
gain admittance to the exclusive
club of captains of industry.

05:01.767 --> 05:04.076
You may not always be liked.

05:04.247 --> 05:06.920
You may sometimes be feared.

05:08.087 --> 05:10.885
But you will always be respected.

05:12.167 --> 05:15.159
Today, when the pressures
of globalization

05:15.367 --> 05:18.200
maintain suspicions of easy money

05:18.407 --> 05:21.797
l hope you always keep in mind
our school motto...

05:22.407 --> 05:24.716
''No gain without pain.''

05:24.887 --> 05:29.085
So when you are forced to wield
the axe, to call for layoffs,

05:29.287 --> 05:32.165
remember that the good
of your company

05:32.807 --> 05:36.436
is the result of your labors,
your self-denial,

05:37.287 --> 05:39.005
your self-sacrifice.

05:40.367 --> 05:44.679
So welcome to this house
which is now your home.

05:45.727 --> 05:48.799
May it be the temple
of your achievements,

05:50.007 --> 05:53.317
the crucible of your future.

06:16.087 --> 06:17.156
What?

06:18.447 --> 06:20.278
You hit 'Alt'' and ''F4''.

06:20.887 --> 06:22.764
lt makes it automatic.

06:22.927 --> 06:24.565
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

06:27.527 --> 06:30.325
- Did you pick your courses?
- Not yet.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.484
We have to double up.

06:32.847 --> 06:35.919
- Have to what?
- Work in pairs on certain subjects.

06:36.087 --> 06:37.406
Certain subjects?

06:37.567 --> 06:40.639
Macro-economics.
Management. Marketing.

06:40.807 --> 06:42.081
l see.

06:47.887 --> 06:49.798
This school has lots to offer.

06:50.007 --> 06:51.486
Take advantage of it.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.039
Here comes Emeline.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.323
- Where?
- Just kidding.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.642
That why
you won't take class with her?

07:04.807 --> 07:05.842
Don't be silly.

07:06.167 --> 07:07.919
This is my son.

07:08.567 --> 07:11.081
He has the skills?
Painting? Masonry?

07:11.247 --> 07:14.444
- He's a hard worker.
- We'll see about that.

07:17.967 --> 07:19.923
Thierry, come here.

07:20.127 --> 07:22.038
Put him on the paint job.

07:23.287 --> 07:25.118
Go change over there.

07:49.247 --> 07:51.442
<i>Welcome to Normale Supérieur> .</i>

07:55.247 --> 07:56.726
lsn't this beautiful?

07:57.407 --> 07:59.762
Nothing like your business school.

08:00.967 --> 08:03.003
Obviously. l'm normal,

08:03.247 --> 08:04.885
you're superior.

08:08.287 --> 08:10.437
When do l meet your friends,

08:10.607 --> 08:12.962
the future masters of the world?

08:13.847 --> 08:15.041
Soon enough.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.562
Louis-Arnault's dying to meet you.

08:17.927 --> 08:20.077
Seems l talk about you all the time.

08:26.647 --> 08:28.478
Faster, guys!

08:56.087 --> 08:59.124
You were terrific!
You're dripping wet!

09:08.127 --> 09:10.118
No women in the locker room.

09:10.287 --> 09:11.766
- Too bad.
- Sorry.

09:22.407 --> 09:25.444
- ls it always like this?
- Especially when we win.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.756
We're still dry. We'd better leave.

09:31.927 --> 09:34.487
- l think so, too. Coming?
- Be right out.

09:35.527 --> 09:38.883
l really like the flat
l found near campus.

09:39.487 --> 09:41.318
The layout is stunning.

09:41.727 --> 09:43.126
Will you come see it?

09:43.687 --> 09:45.518
- l mean, with Paul.
- Sure.

09:46.207 --> 09:48.767
Why didn't Louis-Arnault
move in with you?

09:48.927 --> 09:51.805
Not so fast.
l value my independence.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.162
But the four of us could do dinner.

09:54.407 --> 09:56.967
l sure couldn't do one in my studio.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.958
Are you cramped for space?

09:59.127 --> 10:02.039
lt's OK,
but not as good as yours.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.486
Not bad.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.120
Sexy, aren't they?

10:06.727 --> 10:08.797
l see we have similar tastes.

10:09.367 --> 10:12.404
Your guy's not bad, either.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.515
- Here come our athletes.
- How's it going?

10:19.567 --> 10:21.876
- Need a lift?
- And our Business Club?

10:22.047 --> 10:25.119
- We can take the metro.
- As you like.

10:25.287 --> 10:27.437
- Later.
- Tomorrow.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.361
Shall we?

10:31.367 --> 10:32.880
Alone, at last!

10:33.167 --> 10:35.806
Five minutes without Louis-Arnault?

10:35.967 --> 10:37.719
What's that supposed to mean?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.037
This sports craze is new for you.

10:40.447 --> 10:42.642
Like your fits of jealousy?

10:44.327 --> 10:45.555
Let's go.

10:54.007 --> 10:56.123
You almost finished?

10:58.367 --> 11:01.439
l think l told you...
thicker lettering.

11:01.607 --> 11:04.326
- lt won't look nice.
- Beauty doesn't matter...

11:04.567 --> 11:06.205
Make the D thicker.

11:07.527 --> 11:09.995
Like that... You see?

11:10.527 --> 11:12.245
The bigger the better.

11:12.407 --> 11:15.319
''God is Great''...
''Deus Magnus est.''

11:16.287 --> 11:18.755
Sure, l got it. 'Allahu Akbar.''

11:34.047 --> 11:35.878
His dad was a diplomat in Asia.

11:36.087 --> 11:37.202
You look surprised,

11:37.407 --> 11:39.602
but you learn fast as a kid.

11:40.127 --> 11:43.244
Since you speak Chinese,
ask him for silverware.

11:44.607 --> 11:46.120
Be right back.

11:48.927 --> 11:54.206
<i>l could've applied for Normale Sup ,
too. For the beauty of it.</i>

11:54.407 --> 11:56.921
Meaning he thinks
he would have got in.

11:57.087 --> 11:59.920
Say what you mean.
Math gets you anywhere,

12:00.127 --> 12:02.004
Lit gets you nowhere.

12:02.207 --> 12:04.038
The credo of bourgeois France!

12:07.207 --> 12:08.435
Who was that?

12:08.807 --> 12:11.640
A journalist who did two years
in a labor camp.

12:11.807 --> 12:14.116
lt didn't put him off Chinese food?

12:15.207 --> 12:16.606
lt wasn't in China.

12:17.567 --> 12:21.765
- He's here for our conference.
- She's a human rights activist.

12:27.687 --> 12:29.359
You asleep or daydreaming?

12:31.287 --> 12:33.676
'Even sleepers are workers

12:34.047 --> 12:37.517
and collaborators
in what goes on in the universe.''

12:38.447 --> 12:41.917
A quote from Heraclitus.
A 5th century B.C. Greek poet.

12:42.447 --> 12:45.086
Greek? ls that for Mass?

12:45.247 --> 12:46.760
lt stimulates the senses.

12:47.007 --> 12:48.076
You studied Philo?

12:48.287 --> 12:50.118
Socrates, Plato... ring a bell?

12:50.327 --> 12:51.760
That was ages ago.

12:51.927 --> 12:52.916
What did they say?

12:53.127 --> 12:56.324
That we each search
for our missing better half.

12:56.967 --> 12:59.083
Without finding it, l suppose.

12:59.847 --> 13:00.996
Not so sure.

13:07.807 --> 13:11.686
'As they are already friends
without contact of the senses,

13:11.927 --> 13:15.966
it is unlikely that the pleasures
tasted weaken their friendship

13:16.127 --> 13:19.642
but rather serve as a pledge
of pleasures to come.''

13:23.287 --> 13:26.438
There's a meeting on start-ups.
lnterested?

13:26.607 --> 13:28.438
Not at all?

13:39.367 --> 13:41.437
Coming to the start-up meeting?

13:41.607 --> 13:42.835
l don't know.

13:43.007 --> 13:45.760
We're having an informal
meeting on...

13:48.567 --> 13:50.637
Hold on... Let me start over.

13:50.807 --> 13:54.766
A meeting on the plight
of start-ups in our school.

13:54.927 --> 13:56.599
- lnterested?
- When is it?

13:56.767 --> 13:58.325
ln 10 minutes in Hall B.

13:58.487 --> 14:01.206
- l'm waiting for someone.
- Bring him along.

14:01.367 --> 14:04.723
- We'll see.
- Great. See you there.

14:20.047 --> 14:21.162
Yes, buy!

14:22.167 --> 14:24.397
Buy, l tell you. Buy right away.

14:26.887 --> 14:29.640
Know how much
you made me lose last time?

14:29.807 --> 14:33.720
l didn't say, ''Take out...
an option,'' l said, ''Buy.''

14:34.287 --> 14:37.404
So do it.
You work for me, right?

14:48.687 --> 14:50.723
You didn't want a croissant?

14:51.287 --> 14:52.720
What are you doing?

14:53.287 --> 14:56.120
l'm trying to de-bourgeoise myself.

14:56.287 --> 14:58.755
The word is ''disembourgeoise,''
l think.

14:59.047 --> 15:01.686
lt took coming here to realize it.

15:01.847 --> 15:04.122
They see me as provincial,
hard-working.

15:04.327 --> 15:08.115
l think l'm well-dressed, but to
them l look like a shop mannequin.

15:08.287 --> 15:11.006
Next to me,
they're from another world.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.361
l can't see that.

15:12.567 --> 15:16.276
They invent these elite schools
to reproduce a notch higher,

15:16.447 --> 15:18.756
to raise us above small trade.

15:18.927 --> 15:21.361
Doctors, they see us
heading German labs.

15:21.767 --> 15:25.157
Engineers, they see us
running Silicon Valley.

15:25.367 --> 15:28.120
As if it weren't any less empty.

15:28.287 --> 15:31.006
But they can still be CEOs.

15:31.207 --> 15:33.482
But almost without wanting to be.

15:33.647 --> 15:36.320
lt's a habit they acquire young.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.637
We had to run to get this far.

15:39.367 --> 15:40.925
We start out breathless.

15:41.127 --> 15:44.437
We're privileged. Others would
settle for what we have.

15:44.967 --> 15:46.446
Most even envy us.

15:46.607 --> 15:48.996
There's an exam
that stands between us.

15:50.287 --> 15:52.437
That exam is the key.

15:53.567 --> 15:56.798
We're getting
the best education available.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.158
The thing is to believe it.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.921
You're one of the elite.
You're satisfied.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.396
So for you, everything's fine.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.686
l'm looking for my brother,
the new painter.

16:10.847 --> 16:12.678
- The young guy?
- Yeah.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.803
He must be back there.

16:15.327 --> 16:17.477
Thanks, guys. Enjoy!

16:18.407 --> 16:20.967
lt's the refrain. l just wrote it.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.316
So?

16:25.247 --> 16:26.316
Not quite.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.519
- You mean it?
- Only Mouss could write lyrics.

16:29.687 --> 16:31.279
Not that traitor!

16:31.687 --> 16:34.326
Not: 'I walk head high
to hide my tears.''

16:34.487 --> 16:38.002
No, it's:
'I walk with my head in the stars

16:38.167 --> 16:40.317
to keep my tears from falling.''

16:40.567 --> 16:43.035
- You can't write that.
- Why not?

16:43.207 --> 16:45.038
- lt's too much.
- Too much what?

16:45.207 --> 16:46.845
Too much self-pity.

16:47.127 --> 16:48.640
So what?

16:49.007 --> 16:51.157
- You asked, l'm telling you.
- Just wait.

16:51.367 --> 16:54.040
Feelings are cruel,
but never excessive.

16:54.207 --> 16:56.641
Look, l gotta get back to work.

16:57.287 --> 17:00.085
- See you tonight.
- Right.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.204
What is this mess?

17:08.007 --> 17:09.645
Not you again!

17:09.847 --> 17:13.635
- Sorry, chief, it was an accident.
- Glad to hear it!

17:15.166 --> 17:17.476
- Look!
- What is it?

17:17.646 --> 17:19.319
l'll re-paint everything.

17:19.487 --> 17:22.398
Oh, yeah? Look at this cob job!

17:22.607 --> 17:24.483
Did you learn in the Casbah?

17:24.646 --> 17:25.840
Do something.

17:27.406 --> 17:28.760
lt's not our business.

17:28.927 --> 17:33.079
You should've used a drop cloth.
You call this a good job?

17:33.247 --> 17:35.283
He reads too much Foucault!

17:36.127 --> 17:39.244
You can't talk like that here.

17:39.407 --> 17:42.444
- Excuse me?
- You heard me. Leave him alone.

17:44.047 --> 17:46.607
- This your beeswax?
- You're on our campus.

17:46.767 --> 17:49.520
You can't make racist remarks here.

17:49.727 --> 17:53.276
- Who are you to talk to me like that?
- No one. Anyone.

17:53.487 --> 17:56.445
- Get lost!
- Be polite or l call the dean.

17:56.647 --> 17:59.878
Call the Pope while you're at it!

18:00.087 --> 18:01.839
Can you paint, at least?

18:02.047 --> 18:05.835
- l'll shove it down your throat!
- lt's a misunderstanding.

18:06.007 --> 18:08.362
- What's going on?
- He's out of bounds.

18:08.527 --> 18:10.165
He's just a bit excited.

18:10.367 --> 18:11.516
We'll see later.

18:11.727 --> 18:14.844
Back to work, gentlemen.
And you, calm down.

18:32.087 --> 18:34.203
Out of my two years in prison,

18:34.367 --> 18:37.643
l spent six months
in a detention center,

18:38.687 --> 18:40.917
and 18 months in a labor camp.

18:42.367 --> 18:43.880
That was the worst!

18:46.007 --> 18:50.603
We had to carry heavy stones
from the docks to the boats.

18:52.487 --> 18:57.641
ln the morning, we were only allowed
to drink the dirty river water.

18:59.247 --> 19:00.999
But not while we worked.

19:02.087 --> 19:06.638
The guards forced the sick prisoners
to spit in our food.

19:06.807 --> 19:10.720
We had to eat in front of them
so we'd get sick ourselves.

19:10.887 --> 19:15.119
They selected some of us
to beat with electric shock batons.

19:15.287 --> 19:18.518
Just like that, for no reason,
to scare the others.

19:19.127 --> 19:21.846
l spent a lot of time in isolation.

19:22.287 --> 19:27.156
They called it ''jail within jail.''

19:31.887 --> 19:35.243
Torture was part of the routine.

19:38.487 --> 19:40.682
l had chains on my legs.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.001
l could hear my friends' screams

19:47.567 --> 19:49.319
as they were tortured,

19:50.567 --> 19:52.797
while waiting for my turn to come.

20:18.687 --> 20:21.440
Forgot your keys again? Great.

20:26.407 --> 20:29.717
- Still working?
- You might say that.

20:29.887 --> 20:33.118
- On your law case?
- Our law case.

20:38.407 --> 20:40.363
Try using a glass.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.682
You didn't ask Louis-Arnault
for help?

20:44.327 --> 20:46.397
We can't ask him every time.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.842
Good luck. Good night.

20:50.127 --> 20:52.641
The bottle...
Will it put itself away?

21:10.007 --> 21:11.963
lt's me. Can l come in?

21:12.167 --> 21:13.361
Sure.

21:18.327 --> 21:19.760
Am l disturbing you?

21:20.327 --> 21:22.443
So, how was the conference?

21:22.607 --> 21:25.724
Powerful. Moving testimonies.
l almost cried.

21:25.887 --> 21:29.482
Our problems are nothing
compared to what they've endured.

21:29.687 --> 21:33.282
- You just realized life's unfair?
- That what you think?

21:33.447 --> 21:35.483
Not quite, happily.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.885
- lt's quite an agenda!
- You should've come.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.925
Another time.
You didn't stay with Agnes?

21:42.087 --> 21:45.523
She was with a group.
So l came home. And the opera?

21:45.687 --> 21:48.599
Sublime! Emeline was in tears.

21:48.767 --> 21:52.077
- She didn't stay with you?
- She's not my whole life.

21:52.287 --> 21:55.085
- What are you reading?
- Chateaubriand.

21:55.247 --> 21:58.398
- You would read Chateaubriand!
- Why?

21:58.567 --> 22:01.240
He's a bit...
conventional, isn't he?

22:04.367 --> 22:05.561
Here.

22:06.047 --> 22:07.366
Sit down.

22:07.887 --> 22:09.240
Listen to this.

22:15.607 --> 22:16.801
Here it is...

22:17.767 --> 22:19.485
His impressions of America.

22:22.087 --> 22:24.760
'English mores follow
the English everywhere.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.725
After crossing regions
without a sign of life,

22:27.887 --> 22:31.197
l spied the sign to an inn
swinging from a branch.

22:31.527 --> 22:33.961
Once,
l entered one of these hostels,

22:34.127 --> 22:37.199
and was stunned to see
a huge circular bed

22:37.807 --> 22:39.126
built around a pole.

22:39.727 --> 22:43.515
Each traveler got into the bed,
feet towards the pole,

22:44.007 --> 22:47.238
head on the outside of the circle,

22:47.407 --> 22:50.797
so that the sleepers
were laid out symmetrically

22:50.967 --> 22:54.039
like the spokes of a wheel
or the ribs of a fan.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.044
After some hesitation,

22:56.447 --> 23:00.360
l got into this contraption,
as there was no one else.

23:02.687 --> 23:04.598
l began to nod off,

23:05.167 --> 23:08.204
when l felt something rub
against me.

23:15.527 --> 23:18.837
lt was my big Dutchman's leg.''

23:20.447 --> 23:24.326
- You find that conventional?
- No. You're right.

23:24.767 --> 23:27.042
l never read him
from that perspective.

23:28.967 --> 23:31.117
Well, then...

23:33.567 --> 23:34.841
Good night.

23:35.487 --> 23:36.636
Sleep well.

23:50.687 --> 23:52.882
- What stocks do you have?
- None.

23:53.047 --> 23:55.163
- What?
- l have none.

23:55.327 --> 23:57.841
You have no portfolio? No capital?

23:58.007 --> 23:59.679
Not really.

24:00.247 --> 24:01.965
- You're a bad catch?
- And you?

24:02.607 --> 24:05.405
l do more than just speculate.

24:07.167 --> 24:08.566
Hey, guys...

24:08.727 --> 24:12.037
l forgot a book at the library.
Catch you later?

24:12.487 --> 24:13.681
Sure.

24:29.727 --> 24:33.083
- Do you have a minute?
- My friends are waiting.

24:33.247 --> 24:34.839
Do you have a moment, sir?

24:35.007 --> 24:37.840
- No need for formalities.
- So you got a minute.

24:38.007 --> 24:40.680
About the other day,
no need to thank me.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.963
l should've done it in public,
right?

24:43.127 --> 24:44.719
What nonsense!

24:44.887 --> 24:47.447
Time to defend me,
but not listen to me?

24:50.087 --> 24:51.520
Why'd you help me?

24:51.687 --> 24:55.157
l don't know.
lt seemed the right thing to do.

24:55.767 --> 24:58.804
Not to everyone.
Your friends didn't react.

24:58.967 --> 25:00.798
lt brought back memories.

25:01.487 --> 25:03.443
lt'd take too long to explain.

25:03.607 --> 25:06.758
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. Honestly.

25:07.487 --> 25:09.478
Don't wanna be seen with me?

25:09.887 --> 25:11.639
Don't read things into it!

25:14.807 --> 25:16.843
- We can meet Saturday.
- OK.

25:17.847 --> 25:20.919
- Give me your cell number?
- l'll write it down.

25:24.647 --> 25:27.002
My name's Mecir.

25:27.487 --> 25:28.715
Call me?

25:29.087 --> 25:30.156
Sure.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.839
Not staying?

26:24.847 --> 26:26.963
l have to study with Chouquet.

26:27.927 --> 26:32.443
- On Saturday! Can't it wait a day?
- Tomorrow he's with Yvette.

26:33.247 --> 26:35.477
l mean... Eve.

26:35.647 --> 26:37.365
An engineering student and ex.

26:37.527 --> 26:41.076
l thought we had a date tonight.
You never stay over.

26:41.247 --> 26:44.159
l'm free tomorrow afternoon.

26:44.647 --> 26:45.796
OK?

26:47.007 --> 26:47.962
Tomorrow.

26:48.127 --> 26:50.925
Call me first.
l may not be free, either.

26:51.327 --> 26:52.476
Oh, yeah?

27:09.807 --> 27:11.559
You see? l came.

27:11.727 --> 27:12.921
Let's go.

27:14.607 --> 27:17.075
A car!
And you make me take the metro!

27:22.407 --> 27:25.399
- This your car?
- Why? Think l stole it?

27:25.567 --> 27:30.083
Think we're all dealers? We can't
have cars, credit cards and flats!

27:30.247 --> 27:32.807
- You have all that?
- The flat, not yet.

27:32.967 --> 27:35.322
- So where to?
- Relax, you're my guest.

28:05.327 --> 28:08.922
lsn't this nice?
lt's like not being in Paris.

28:09.087 --> 28:11.396
l don't know Paris.
l'm a provincial.

28:11.567 --> 28:13.080
Where you from?

28:13.247 --> 28:16.205
The south, minus the accent.
Carcassonne. And you?

28:16.367 --> 28:19.643
From a village near theirs.
But l was born here.

28:23.807 --> 28:27.925
- You drinking orange juice?
- No alcohol. lt's not for athletes.

28:28.727 --> 28:30.365
We're not athletes here.

28:30.727 --> 28:32.877
lsn't that why you invited me?

28:38.527 --> 28:41.724
Should l have sent out an invite?
You people do that.

28:42.527 --> 28:44.245
- What do you know?
- What l see.

28:44.447 --> 28:47.166
You look so self-confident
yet so uptight.

28:47.887 --> 28:51.163
Well-dressed, but out of style.
Arrogant and proud.

28:51.327 --> 28:52.999
Outside of reality.

28:53.207 --> 28:54.879
No wonder the world's a mess.

28:56.007 --> 28:56.883
Oh, really?

28:57.207 --> 28:59.198
lf your kind pulls the strings.

28:59.647 --> 29:01.842
lnsensitive and ruthless.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.805
You're judging from appearances.

29:05.567 --> 29:06.716
You're generalizing.

29:06.927 --> 29:09.964
Not you. You're not like them.
Though the first time...

29:10.127 --> 29:14.086
- The first time?
- l saw you with your redhead friend.

29:14.487 --> 29:15.966
Chouquet.

29:16.127 --> 29:18.243
You looked pathetic.

29:18.407 --> 29:20.204
l thought l didn't.

29:20.367 --> 29:24.679
Relax. Less than him. When you
took my side, l was stunned.

29:25.007 --> 29:28.966
- My dad barked at everyone like him.
- You, too?

29:30.087 --> 29:32.237
Sure. Why not me?

29:32.447 --> 29:34.642
There's a saying where l come from:

29:37.607 --> 29:40.246
''Never tame a wolf to make a dog.''
Let's dance.

29:54.287 --> 29:55.242
C'mon!

30:08.687 --> 30:10.643
Didn't we have a great time?

30:11.207 --> 30:14.279
- How'd you know l live here?
- You told me.

30:15.887 --> 30:17.240
No, l didn't.

30:17.567 --> 30:20.001
l'm sure l didn't.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.957
l followed you the other day.

30:25.007 --> 30:26.406
What for?

30:27.567 --> 30:28.886
Guess.

30:32.567 --> 30:33.716
Guess.

31:43.687 --> 31:46.485
So you came home after all!

31:46.647 --> 31:50.560
- Waiting up?
- We could've done something together.

31:50.727 --> 31:53.764
- Did we plan on it?
- So we have to plan?

31:53.927 --> 31:57.397
- l never know with you.
- lt's time to start knowing.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.319
lsn't that friendship?

32:23.887 --> 32:25.559
ls this your doggie?

32:25.767 --> 32:28.725
You'll get dirty here.
Not in school?

32:28.887 --> 32:30.240
l don't have school.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.523
You at the big or little school?

32:32.687 --> 32:34.120
The big school.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.679
This is our school.
Look at all this.

32:38.847 --> 32:41.202
And over there. And that's

32:41.407 --> 32:43.523
the cafeteria. What's it for?

32:43.727 --> 32:45.718
- To eat.
- Let's give your dog milk.

32:45.927 --> 32:47.076
He doesn't want any.

32:48.127 --> 32:51.836
Breaking your daddy's things?
He'll box your ears.

32:52.967 --> 32:54.719
Sit down here.

32:56.807 --> 32:58.399
Paul! Come here!

33:01.207 --> 33:02.083
And your dog?

33:05.047 --> 33:06.799
l told you to stay with me.

33:07.447 --> 33:10.484
Never play with the workers.
Learn your place.

33:31.287 --> 33:32.800
What is it?

33:38.407 --> 33:39.760
Hold me.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.725
Hold me tight.

34:05.527 --> 34:07.438
You're an American banker.

34:07.647 --> 34:10.844
A client wants to borrow
a million Swiss francs.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.920
You'll make the loan through a
liquidity swap in US dollars.

34:15.847 --> 34:17.803
Market conditions are as follows...

34:17.967 --> 34:20.606
Excuse me, sir,
but what's a ''swap''?

34:22.327 --> 34:26.639
A swap is an item-for-item exchange:
debit, credit...

34:31.167 --> 34:32.282
Chouquet?

34:36.087 --> 34:37.281
Bernard?

34:48.967 --> 34:50.764
Louis-Arnault, you there?

37:27.007 --> 37:30.158
- What're you up to?
- They're Chouquet's toys.

37:33.247 --> 37:36.205
- You're up early.
- l couldn't sleep.

37:36.567 --> 37:38.558
ls it the stress from school?

37:38.727 --> 37:40.160
Not only that.

37:40.887 --> 37:42.320
You're up early, too.

37:42.487 --> 37:45.320
l'm training for Sunday's match.
Will you come?

37:45.487 --> 37:48.763
Sure will. l wouldn't miss it.
Want some coffee?

37:49.087 --> 37:51.043
Sure. Let me shower first.

38:25.927 --> 38:27.997
Your place is as nice as ever.

38:28.247 --> 38:29.919
You should come more often.

38:31.447 --> 38:33.597
You see? l'm here.

39:06.967 --> 39:08.195
'Morning, honey.

39:16.447 --> 39:19.359
- Sleep well, honey?
- Sure did. l needed it.

39:21.767 --> 39:24.361
l Xeroxed articles for your talk.

39:24.687 --> 39:26.484
You had time? Thanks.

39:26.687 --> 39:27.676
These are great.

39:29.047 --> 39:30.116
l made you toast.

39:30.727 --> 39:32.160
That's sweet.

39:34.447 --> 39:36.199
''Discipline and Punish''?

39:36.407 --> 39:40.685
My son has me read Foucault
on prisons. Very interesting.

39:40.847 --> 39:44.635
l know. We have a classmate
who reads only him.

39:44.807 --> 39:46.718
- Who's that?
- Paul Thabor.

39:49.247 --> 39:50.521
Do l know him?

39:50.927 --> 39:52.326
Did l meet him, honey?

39:53.767 --> 39:56.998
No. He's a roommate.
He reads more than that.

39:57.207 --> 39:59.562
- We're off.
- Going so soon?

39:59.767 --> 40:00.995
We still have time.

40:05.407 --> 40:07.796
- See you soon?
- l'll call you.

40:08.367 --> 40:09.766
Forgive us.

40:25.087 --> 40:28.716
- What're you doing in here?
- We'll be more comfortable.

40:29.407 --> 40:31.284
Not in his room.

40:31.527 --> 40:32.596
Come here.

40:41.727 --> 40:44.844
You often study here alone
all weekend?

40:45.007 --> 40:48.204
lt just turned out that way.
l'm not alone. You're here.

40:49.727 --> 40:52.161
- And it just turned out that way?
- What?

40:52.327 --> 40:54.204
Their agreeing to leave together?

40:54.367 --> 40:57.006
They didn't leave together
but separately.

40:57.567 --> 40:59.319
- At the same time?
- Not at all.

40:59.487 --> 41:01.842
Chouquet goes home once a month.

41:02.007 --> 41:05.317
Louis-Arnault went to see a regatta
at the last minute.

41:07.847 --> 41:09.997
To leave you alone here

41:10.167 --> 41:12.283
and give us free reign.

41:13.047 --> 41:17.325
Here or not, what's the difference?
l could've come to your place.

41:17.807 --> 41:20.526
What do you mean by ''free reign''?

41:20.927 --> 41:23.487
Calling things by their name,
l suppose.

41:23.647 --> 41:27.799
Louis-Arnault wasn't sure the regatta
would take place. Uncertain weather.

41:27.967 --> 41:31.926
Uncertain weather
for a concerted departure.

41:32.127 --> 41:33.879
lnsomnia distorts things.

41:34.047 --> 41:37.119
Sleepless nights help you
see more clearly.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.597
At night, everything is more
intense, more real.

41:42.807 --> 41:46.880
- What're you getting at?
- l've become invisible because of him!

41:47.047 --> 41:49.561
Whatever we do, he's always there.

41:52.967 --> 41:56.084
- Let's make a deal.
- A deal?

41:56.247 --> 41:58.715
Let's see which of us seduces
Louis-Arnault?

41:58.887 --> 42:00.161
- What?
- You heard me.

42:00.327 --> 42:02.158
What do you take me for?

42:02.327 --> 42:04.397
''Better to burn out than fade away.''
St. Paul.

42:04.567 --> 42:06.922
He never said it.
And nobody's fading.

42:07.087 --> 42:10.523
You don't see it.
With me you're sweet, considerate...

42:10.687 --> 42:13.565
But when he appears,
you're transformed.

42:13.727 --> 42:15.638
This isn't funny anymore.

42:16.567 --> 42:18.683
All right then.

42:18.847 --> 42:23.318
lf you won't face up to it,
you're more nave than l thought.

42:23.487 --> 42:25.045
Let's sustain the doubt.

42:25.207 --> 42:29.723
Whether you play the game or not,
without you or me knowing it,

42:29.887 --> 42:32.720
let's say l have
Louis-Arnault first.

42:32.887 --> 42:35.720
- Have him?
- That l come and say, 'I had him.''

42:35.887 --> 42:38.003
lf it's him you want him,
take him.

42:38.167 --> 42:42.160
Why try to make me jealous?
You know my feelings haven't changed.

42:42.407 --> 42:44.318
That's what makes me mad!

42:44.727 --> 42:46.399
You're playing with me.

42:46.767 --> 42:50.680
lf l win, l give him up,
but so do you...

42:51.127 --> 42:53.322
Him and all the others to come.

42:53.487 --> 42:56.206
You move in with me in Paris
and that's that.

42:56.367 --> 42:59.518
You sleep with him
and you want to live with me?

43:00.487 --> 43:04.639
On the other hand, if it happens,
without your knowing it, of course,

43:04.807 --> 43:07.401
that you happen to have him first,

43:07.567 --> 43:11.401
then l promise to give you up.

43:12.207 --> 43:15.677
Tell me you don't mean a word
of what you say.

43:16.087 --> 43:18.078
Emeline is an added obstacle.

43:18.247 --> 43:20.238
Stop it, please!

43:26.407 --> 43:27.806
That all the notes you took?

43:27.967 --> 43:29.719
Just what interests me.

43:29.887 --> 43:31.798
Meaning, not much.

43:33.887 --> 43:35.878
Come with me to practice?

43:36.047 --> 43:37.685
Right now?

43:37.847 --> 43:39.326
Yes, now.

43:39.567 --> 43:41.444
lt'll be a nice change.

43:42.207 --> 43:43.640
A nice change!

43:43.847 --> 43:46.281
Get a move on, guys.

43:47.127 --> 43:50.085
Must l remind you
of this season's techniques?

43:53.367 --> 43:55.358
Take your places!

44:18.887 --> 44:20.479
ln threes.

44:21.487 --> 44:23.239
You too, Louis-Arnault.

44:57.607 --> 44:59.199
You okay? Coming?

44:59.367 --> 45:01.483
- l'll wait.
- Come to the locker room.

45:01.647 --> 45:03.478
- You sure?
- Sure.

45:39.047 --> 45:40.400
Gentlemen,

45:40.567 --> 45:43.525
since we have a guest,
let me congratulate you.

45:47.727 --> 45:51.197
Honestly, you practiced today

45:51.567 --> 45:53.239
like a bunch of ballerinas.

45:55.127 --> 45:58.119
ls this the synchronized swimming
championship?

45:58.327 --> 46:00.045
- We'll murder 'em.
- Sure.

46:00.207 --> 46:01.686
We're not girls!

46:01.927 --> 46:04.157
Look at how well l'm hung.

46:04.847 --> 46:07.077
He's our captain!

46:08.487 --> 46:12.366
This weekend's game is crucial.
You'd better fire up the team.

46:12.847 --> 46:14.917
Count on us. We'll do fine.

46:16.207 --> 46:18.801
Strong minds, powerful hands!

46:21.687 --> 46:23.279
l'm counting on you.

46:23.447 --> 46:25.722
l don't want to hear it.

46:28.047 --> 46:30.277
Come and shower, coach!

46:49.367 --> 46:51.198
We're all motivated!

47:30.127 --> 47:32.800
Come to breathe the air
of management?

47:34.247 --> 47:36.283
For the inter-school meeting.

47:36.447 --> 47:38.802
Right, for that
Texas Death Row convict?

47:38.967 --> 47:42.118
- Yes. You know about it?
- Sure l do.

47:42.607 --> 47:43.835
What do you think?

47:44.007 --> 47:46.965
He's guilty.
After all, he killed his friend.

47:47.127 --> 47:48.845
They haven't proven it.

47:49.487 --> 47:53.082
Don't men feel certain attractions
they won't admit to?

47:54.207 --> 47:57.119
How'd you react
if your guy loved another guy?

47:59.487 --> 48:01.239
No chance of that.

48:01.407 --> 48:04.604
He likes women too much.
A bit too much, even.

48:04.807 --> 48:05.956
But just imagine...

48:06.127 --> 48:08.516
lt's crazy.
l never thought about it.

48:08.727 --> 48:11.036
First, l'd feel wounded as a woman.

48:12.047 --> 48:13.844
Then l'd try to understand:

48:14.527 --> 48:16.518
Did l do enough to keep him?

48:17.927 --> 48:19.280
lt rather thrills me.

48:19.447 --> 48:20.960
What do you mean?

48:21.687 --> 48:25.043
We have more than our femininity
to seduce men.

48:26.167 --> 48:27.919
And women, too.

48:29.287 --> 48:30.879
l see.

48:31.047 --> 48:34.005
For you,
charm works through the mind.

48:34.167 --> 48:36.806
That's where you Lit people
stump me.

48:36.967 --> 48:40.403
You want to dissect everything,
find meaning everywhere.

48:40.567 --> 48:43.479
l don't agree.
l wasn't raised like that.

48:43.927 --> 48:47.840
- We're not of the same world?
- We're different, that's all.

48:48.047 --> 48:49.162
lt's the guys...

48:50.487 --> 48:53.126
With them,
we end up spending time together.

48:53.287 --> 48:55.005
- We might as well...
- Still...

48:55.407 --> 48:58.080
you had time
to form an opinion about me.

48:58.287 --> 49:01.723
Yes, l had time...
And what Louis-Arnault told me.

49:02.887 --> 49:04.445
He talk about me?

49:04.967 --> 49:06.082
Sometimes.

49:09.647 --> 49:11.319
l'm off to class.

49:11.647 --> 49:13.205
See you later.

49:18.527 --> 49:20.245
Your coach always like that?

49:20.407 --> 49:23.604
He was overdoing it.
But it's a good team.

49:23.767 --> 49:25.883
True. Real good.

49:26.367 --> 49:28.358
l really have the feeling that...

49:29.847 --> 49:31.883
l should take the offensive more?

49:32.407 --> 49:33.999
Offensive?

49:34.567 --> 49:36.637
To improve team spirit.

49:38.687 --> 49:40.439
No, actually...

49:41.287 --> 49:43.164
What l really meant was...

49:43.767 --> 49:45.439
l have to tell you...

49:47.367 --> 49:48.925
What?

49:50.527 --> 49:52.199
Should l take up sports?

49:52.367 --> 49:55.040
You should. lt clears the head.

49:56.007 --> 49:57.486
The head?

49:58.007 --> 50:00.282
All that muddle in one's mind.

50:00.487 --> 50:03.399
- Depends on what you call muddle.
- Obviously.

50:26.047 --> 50:27.844
Didn't expect to see me again?

50:28.647 --> 50:31.081
- Are you parked far?
- Over there.

50:31.247 --> 50:32.999
Wanna go for a drive?

50:34.327 --> 50:35.442
lf you want to.

50:37.687 --> 50:38.881
Yes, l want to.

50:41.527 --> 50:43.006
Let's go to the coast.

50:43.167 --> 50:45.476
- When?
- Right now.

50:45.967 --> 50:48.845
- l haven't any money.
- l have my credit card.

52:58.287 --> 52:59.720
Are you OK?

53:02.527 --> 53:05.087
- Thanks for coming down.
- lt's nothing.

53:06.487 --> 53:08.284
What do you think?

53:11.567 --> 53:13.080
Effective.

53:13.527 --> 53:14.960
A bit too much so.

53:15.127 --> 53:19.040
That's just like you. Except in
the pool, you never take the plunge.

53:19.967 --> 53:22.037
That's not why you asked me
to come.

53:22.207 --> 53:24.960
No. l suppose you've heard.

53:26.247 --> 53:27.726
Not again!

53:27.887 --> 53:29.320
You don't let up.

53:29.487 --> 53:33.162
There was no evidence.
He may be executed any day now.

53:33.327 --> 53:35.318
Where do l fit in?

53:35.807 --> 53:38.446
l heard that your father...

53:40.127 --> 53:41.560
l get it.

53:42.087 --> 53:44.476
He's preparing
the international summit?

53:44.647 --> 53:45.966
Affirmative.

53:46.127 --> 53:49.324
Ask him to submit this file
to the minister.

53:49.727 --> 53:52.560
He hates being appealed to.
Especially by me.

53:52.727 --> 53:54.797
Then let me make the case to him.

53:54.967 --> 53:56.605
ls that all?

53:58.327 --> 54:00.204
Look, it's a lost cause.

54:00.367 --> 54:02.119
Don't be insensitive.

54:02.287 --> 54:04.721
lnnocent or guilty doesn't matter.

54:04.887 --> 54:08.277
- Happily, no. lf there's any hope...
- lt's not up to my dad.

54:08.447 --> 54:11.883
He can gain time for us.
That means a lot. Please...

54:12.447 --> 54:14.119
Help us.

54:14.447 --> 54:16.119
Help me.

54:29.447 --> 54:33.042
lf l do it,
l can't guarantee it'll work.

54:33.207 --> 54:34.686
Of course not.

54:35.287 --> 54:37.118
lt's at your own risk.

54:37.287 --> 54:38.925
l'm sure l can convince him.

54:44.167 --> 54:46.920
That deserves a small reward.

54:47.487 --> 54:49.000
Already?

54:49.287 --> 54:51.278
You don't do anything for free.

54:53.047 --> 54:54.605
Let's just say that...

54:55.207 --> 54:57.243
l take advantage of the situation.

55:16.407 --> 55:18.477
So l can count on you?

55:24.887 --> 55:26.320
Yes, boss.

55:28.807 --> 55:29.922
Want to get a drink?

55:30.087 --> 55:32.396
No time. l have to finish.

55:33.087 --> 55:34.918
Business first.

55:35.447 --> 55:37.278
Know all about it, don't you?

55:46.687 --> 55:49.884
There you are.
Have you seen Louis-Arnault?

55:51.367 --> 55:53.756
He's supposed to give us
Desvaux's lecture.

55:53.927 --> 55:57.044
- Try the pool.
- He spends his life in the water!

55:57.207 --> 56:00.756
lf you see him, tell him
we're stuck without his notes.

56:00.927 --> 56:03.805
- l have them.
- Can we borrow them?

56:03.967 --> 56:06.959
l need them. Tomorrow, if you want.

56:07.127 --> 56:10.676
Problem is, the marketing case
is due tomorrow.

56:10.847 --> 56:13.725
And neither of you could make
the class?

56:13.887 --> 56:15.843
Desvaux's a good teacher.

56:16.487 --> 56:20.719
Sure, but we three share the work.
Louis-Arnault was going...

56:20.887 --> 56:22.525
That's not the best way.

56:22.687 --> 56:24.837
And when he's no longer around?

56:25.007 --> 56:27.805
Look, we'll ask
Louis-Arnault tonight.

56:27.967 --> 56:29.719
lt's no big deal.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.878
Fine. See you later.

56:35.167 --> 56:37.123
- Thanks.
- She needs them!

56:37.287 --> 56:39.482
But they were right here.

56:39.647 --> 56:42.036
l'm sure we could've convinced her.

56:43.007 --> 56:45.601
Charity for a former student,
please!

56:59.727 --> 57:01.877
You always let the dishes pile up?

57:02.047 --> 57:05.676
lt's Louis-Arnault's turn.
You see him doing dishes?

57:05.847 --> 57:07.758
Not really.

57:08.367 --> 57:09.766
lt's true.

57:09.927 --> 57:14.398
Where is he? With all those red
lights, he should've been here first.

57:14.567 --> 57:16.478
Maybe he went jogging first!

57:16.687 --> 57:18.245
He won't be long.

57:18.407 --> 57:21.240
Literature's great.
l never remember lines.

57:21.407 --> 57:23.796
lt's a cast of mind, l suppose.

57:23.967 --> 57:26.720
ln fact,
l'm more mathematically minded.

57:27.767 --> 57:29.246
There's a bag missing.

57:29.407 --> 57:31.557
- You sure?
- Positive.

57:32.247 --> 57:34.477
l'll check the car. Be right back.

57:35.327 --> 57:36.885
Chouquet, over here!

57:37.687 --> 57:38.563
Help me.

57:38.727 --> 57:41.639
What's all this blood?
What happened?

57:41.807 --> 57:43.479
lt's nothing. Help me up.

57:43.647 --> 57:46.445
Hold on! What's all this blood?

57:47.367 --> 57:49.323
l'll explain later.

57:50.127 --> 57:52.880
You should've come home with us.
Easy!

57:54.007 --> 57:56.805
- What happened?
- lt's just a scratch.

57:56.967 --> 58:00.243
- Get some gauze!
- lt's just a little blood.

58:00.407 --> 58:01.920
Sit down.

58:02.087 --> 58:04.078
Sit down. Calm down.

58:04.247 --> 58:05.202
lt's OK.

58:05.367 --> 58:07.005
Let me see.

58:11.967 --> 58:13.639
Take this off.

58:13.807 --> 58:15.206
What happened?

58:18.407 --> 58:20.045
This won't hurt.

58:20.887 --> 58:22.605
A guy ran into me.

58:23.047 --> 58:27.563
l asked him to apologize.
He took it badly and pulled a knife.

58:27.767 --> 58:30.156
- A guy in a tux?
- Yeah, a weird guy.

58:30.327 --> 58:31.885
Could you recognize him?

58:32.047 --> 58:34.117
No. lt all happened too fast.

58:34.367 --> 58:36.722
The wound's deeper than it looks.

58:36.927 --> 58:38.155
Wake up!

58:39.367 --> 58:41.278
- What's wrong?
- He was attacked.

58:41.447 --> 58:43.802
l'm OK. Where's Emeline?

58:44.527 --> 58:47.166
The hospital!
What're you waiting for?

58:47.327 --> 58:50.000
- Not you!
- Get a blanket, quick!

58:55.047 --> 58:57.322
There's no room. Take a cab.

59:11.087 --> 59:13.237
- You took your time.
- l ran...

59:13.527 --> 59:15.483
l had no cash for a cab.

59:15.647 --> 59:17.638
lt's not serious. He's asleep.

59:17.807 --> 59:21.004
- Where are they?
- l got him a private room.

59:21.167 --> 59:24.284
- Where?
- Room 20. 5th floor.

59:24.447 --> 59:26.119
l tried to call Emeline...

59:31.807 --> 59:33.320
Here he is.

59:33.487 --> 59:36.718
Your hero.
The sleeping hospital beauty.

59:36.887 --> 59:38.605
Quiet. You'll wake him.

59:38.767 --> 59:40.485
Not a chance.

59:40.647 --> 59:42.558
They gave him sleeping pills.

59:45.847 --> 59:47.280
Don't!

59:47.727 --> 59:50.719
l wouldn't hesitate if l were you.

59:50.967 --> 59:53.083
Look how he's sleeping.

59:53.687 --> 59:55.643
How soft he is.

01:00:02.687 --> 01:00:05.565
At your mercy.
Take advantage of it.

01:00:11.807 --> 01:00:14.116
lt's a once-only chance.

01:00:15.007 --> 01:00:17.441
Stop it! You know l love you.

01:00:27.287 --> 01:00:30.723
We've always been nice,
well-behaved little boys,

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:34.840
good at school, hard-working,

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:36.759
home for our snack.

01:00:37.327 --> 01:00:40.683
Then we're nice teenagers,
insecure but in style,

01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:43.281
ready to take exams,
ready to pass them.

01:00:43.527 --> 01:00:45.358
And one day they arrive,

01:00:45.527 --> 01:00:48.200
pull their knives and...

01:00:48.807 --> 01:00:50.001
The world capsizes.

01:00:50.487 --> 01:00:53.399
That's enough!
l thought we were going to study.

01:00:54.047 --> 01:00:55.036
You're studying.

01:00:55.247 --> 01:00:57.044
The case is due tomorrow.

01:00:59.047 --> 01:01:01.242
Don't expect your name on it.

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:24.075
So you're up?

01:01:26.287 --> 01:01:27.402
Sleep well?

01:01:27.567 --> 01:01:30.001
Hard to, with the doors slamming.

01:01:30.367 --> 01:01:32.642
That was Chouquet.
But he went out.

01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:36.123
How you feeling?

01:01:38.567 --> 01:01:39.920
OK.

01:01:41.207 --> 01:01:43.926
lt still hurts and l have a fever,
but l'm OK.

01:01:44.727 --> 01:01:46.718
- Need anything?
- No, thanks.

01:01:47.927 --> 01:01:50.487
What happened here?
Did you two argue?

01:01:51.687 --> 01:01:54.679
l said our lives hang by a thread.
He stormed out.

01:01:54.847 --> 01:01:56.041
By a thread?

01:01:56.207 --> 01:01:59.517
l meant our folks' sacrifices,
all those years of school...

01:01:59.687 --> 01:02:02.997
Our parents' sacrifices?
That's not like you.

01:02:03.527 --> 01:02:07.156
We're at the mercy of a knife attack.
That made him furious.

01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:08.965
Sure, it's not very original.

01:02:09.127 --> 01:02:11.687
l doubt it was
the lack of originality.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:16.957
- What're you working on?
- A case study. Didn't get far.

01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:19.277
l thought you were with Chouquet.

01:02:19.447 --> 01:02:21.483
He doesn't understand much.

01:02:21.647 --> 01:02:22.636
That complicated?

01:02:22.807 --> 01:02:25.924
l don't even get the first four
we went over.

01:02:26.127 --> 01:02:28.163
- What don't you get?
- The problem.

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:31.160
- ''Takover Bid to LBO''?
- l missed the class.

01:02:31.327 --> 01:02:34.080
- On the LB0?
- And the one on takeovers.

01:02:34.247 --> 01:02:37.398
- Didn't you attend any finance class?
- No.

01:02:37.967 --> 01:02:40.242
- l see.
- Right. Let's skip it.

01:02:40.407 --> 01:02:43.683
Maybe if l read the books
or even Chouquet's notes...

01:02:43.887 --> 01:02:46.685
LBOs are designed to thwart
hostile takeovers.

01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:48.678
lt's a leverage buy-out.

01:02:48.847 --> 01:02:53.796
CEOs team up with finance agents
to head off a hostile takeover.

01:02:54.007 --> 01:02:55.360
They buy their own stock.

01:02:55.527 --> 01:02:58.200
- With what money?
- A small amount of cash,

01:02:58.487 --> 01:03:01.638
and loans on the junk bond market.

01:03:01.847 --> 01:03:03.838
You know what junk bonds are?

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.121
Sure, l do.

01:03:06.287 --> 01:03:08.323
The biggest case was RJR Nabisco.

01:03:09.487 --> 01:03:13.002
RJ Reynolds tobacco
merges with Nabisco, the food giant.

01:03:13.167 --> 01:03:14.885
Ritz crackers...

01:03:15.287 --> 01:03:16.959
Oh, yeah, crackers.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.915
3 years later, after the biggest
LBO ever, they part ways.

01:03:22.047 --> 01:03:25.084
Amount of their takeover
by their immediate predator:

01:03:25.247 --> 01:03:28.478
$25 billion... A record.

01:03:29.007 --> 01:03:30.042
What for?

01:03:30.247 --> 01:03:33.922
No more bureaucrats,
no more inept management.

01:03:34.087 --> 01:03:36.555
But the factories,
personnel and managers?

01:03:36.727 --> 01:03:39.719
ln the hands of financiers.
Business engineering is out.

01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:43.006
Today, financiers
and corporate lawyers rule.

01:03:43.207 --> 01:03:45.960
And the real economy?

01:03:46.127 --> 01:03:49.119
Get past
the industrial revolution, OK?

01:03:49.687 --> 01:03:51.279
Not OK.

01:03:52.127 --> 01:03:55.517
- What?
- l just can't get into it.

01:03:55.847 --> 01:03:57.166
Look...

01:03:57.327 --> 01:04:01.366
Thanks for your help.
You talk about it with passion,

01:04:01.527 --> 01:04:03.961
but, frankly,
it doesn't interest me.

01:04:04.127 --> 01:04:06.687
- And your finance case?
- l won't hand it in.

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:09.566
- What about the diploma?
- That's just it.

01:04:10.087 --> 01:04:12.317
l don't know what's
happening to me.

01:04:13.087 --> 01:04:16.841
l was good in Lit,
English and Philosophy.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:22.481
Lit rated low in provincial schools,
higher than dance but lower than piano.

01:04:23.687 --> 01:04:27.919
l wind up here to hear about LBOs.
Where did l go wrong?

01:04:28.087 --> 01:04:29.918
What did l do?

01:04:30.487 --> 01:04:32.125
l didn't see it coming...

01:04:32.287 --> 01:04:34.437
l thought you wanted help.

01:04:34.607 --> 01:04:36.438
You know what would help me?

01:04:37.247 --> 01:04:39.124
What would really help me,

01:04:39.567 --> 01:04:42.035
is that you do it with
my name on it.

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:44.885
You're not serious.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.322
lt's not a reasonable request?

01:04:48.207 --> 01:04:51.483
How can you be so reasonable,
so much a part of it?

01:04:54.527 --> 01:04:56.119
You're in a bad way.

01:04:56.287 --> 01:04:59.643
True. You got stabbed,
l have a knife in my head.

01:04:59.847 --> 01:05:03.556
How do you cope with it all?
l just can't.

01:05:08.007 --> 01:05:10.077
l need you, Louis-Arnault.

01:05:10.247 --> 01:05:12.078
Don't look down on me.

01:05:12.247 --> 01:05:14.807
- C'mon, old man...
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:05:14.967 --> 01:05:18.164
- What?
- None of your buddy-buddy stuff!

01:05:18.327 --> 01:05:21.399
Make your gestures meaningful.
That's all l ask.

01:05:37.927 --> 01:05:39.406
Mother.

01:05:40.367 --> 01:05:42.323
- l'm coming in.
- Go around.

01:05:43.487 --> 01:05:45.398
What is it? You in pain?

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.080
lt's OK. l'm used to it.

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:48.805
l'll take you home.

01:05:48.967 --> 01:05:50.400
l'm far from finished.

01:05:50.607 --> 01:05:53.599
Meeting somebody?
You're all dressed up.

01:05:56.127 --> 01:05:57.719
Don't expect me for dinner.

01:05:58.567 --> 01:06:00.080
You're in love.

01:06:01.487 --> 01:06:02.715
Love, you know...

01:06:02.967 --> 01:06:05.879
You're wrong.
Enjoy it now, because later...

01:06:07.127 --> 01:06:09.800
- You sure l can go?
- Go on.

01:06:23.887 --> 01:06:26.242
- You're late.
- Sorry, it's Louis-Arnault...

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:30.196
He was attacked but he'll be OK.
He just needed pampering.

01:06:30.367 --> 01:06:31.686
Pampering...

01:06:31.847 --> 01:06:33.997
So you're learning with me,

01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:37.045
practicing to be ready for him,
just in case...

01:06:37.407 --> 01:06:38.635
Then l bow out.

01:06:38.847 --> 01:06:41.281
What nonsense. You're jealous.

01:06:41.447 --> 01:06:44.280
No, clear-minded.
You must do the same with Agnes.

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:46.483
How do you know?
You don't know her.

01:06:46.647 --> 01:06:49.480
Simple intuition,
from being the token Arab.

01:07:00.927 --> 01:07:02.485
- Stop, quick!
- What is it?

01:07:02.647 --> 01:07:04.126
lt's important.

01:07:09.487 --> 01:07:11.079
What is it?

01:07:19.287 --> 01:07:20.481
lt's romantic.

01:07:20.927 --> 01:07:23.077
See? That's important.

01:07:26.327 --> 01:07:29.239
- You starting to enjoy it?
- Tell me...

01:07:30.807 --> 01:07:32.638
How long have you been...

01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:33.922
Been what?

01:07:34.127 --> 01:07:36.846
A fag? That's not it.

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:42.726
Hetero, homo, all that's out.
lt's meaningless.

01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:45.722
lt's because it's you, that's all.

01:07:59.527 --> 01:08:01.199
<i>l'm really moved.</i>

01:08:01.367 --> 01:08:03.039
<i>You mean a lot to me.</i>

01:08:03.207 --> 01:08:05.277
<i>l'm happy with you, too.</i>

01:08:06.447 --> 01:08:09.405
<i>Take me in your arms. Hold me.</i>

01:08:10.047 --> 01:08:11.844
<i>Hold me tight.</i>

01:08:12.047 --> 01:08:14.925
<i>Tight, tight, tight.</i>

01:08:16.006 --> 01:08:19.203
<i>Come on. Let's take a ride
on the merrygo-round.</i>

01:08:19.607 --> 01:08:21.325
<i>Hold me in your arms.</i>

01:08:31.647 --> 01:08:35.242
<i>l want to ride
the merrygo-round. Please.</i>

01:08:35.407 --> 01:08:38.683
<i>Your snack first.
You haven't behaved with Mommy.</i>

01:08:39.287 --> 01:08:40.879
<i>l have too behaved.</i>

01:08:41.046 --> 01:08:43.765
<i>- You're in love.
- Love, you know...</i>

01:08:44.006 --> 01:08:46.042
<i>Enjoy it now, because later...</i>

01:08:47.447 --> 01:08:48.675
<i>l don't have school.</i>

01:08:48.846 --> 01:08:50.599
<i>Big or little school?</i>

01:08:50.767 --> 01:08:52.598
<i>Big school.</i>

01:08:52.846 --> 01:08:54.758
<i>Paul, l told you to stay with me.</i>

01:08:54.926 --> 01:08:56.962
<i>Never play with the workers.</i>

01:08:57.727 --> 01:08:59.206
<i>- Your papers!
- Why us?</i>

01:08:59.367 --> 01:09:01.198
<i>We didn't do anything.</i>

01:09:01.367 --> 01:09:03.118
<i>You're Arabs, aren't you?</i>

01:09:03.287 --> 01:09:05.084
<i>Look how well-hung l am.</i>

01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:08.357
<i>What is it?</i>

01:09:08.607 --> 01:09:11.724
<i>'It was my big Dutchman's leg. ''</i>

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:20.767
<i>- Wait. l'm about to come.
- Me, too.</i>

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:45.845
Gorgeous house!

01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:49.636
Not our doing. lt's been handed
down through the family.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:50.921
Have a seat.

01:09:55.727 --> 01:09:56.716
No, later.

01:09:57.567 --> 01:09:59.398
You seem much better.

01:09:59.567 --> 01:10:01.239
l have a fever.

01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:03.125
lt still aches.

01:10:04.927 --> 01:10:06.519
Want to see?

01:10:15.447 --> 01:10:16.562
Don't.

01:10:16.727 --> 01:10:19.161
Don't. Your father will come.

01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:28.801
- My father's in New York.
- What?

01:10:29.287 --> 01:10:32.165
- My mother, too.
- You didn't keep your word.

01:10:32.367 --> 01:10:34.562
- l did.
- The execution is soon.

01:10:35.167 --> 01:10:38.398
They're all well aware.
They've already stepped in.

01:10:38.967 --> 01:10:41.640
- His fate'll be discussed, not changed.
- Meaning?

01:10:41.847 --> 01:10:43.599
Pressure could backfire.

01:10:43.967 --> 01:10:46.037
You lied to get me here.

01:10:47.527 --> 01:10:48.642
So we'd be alone.

01:10:51.527 --> 01:10:53.165
Let yourself go.

01:10:53.687 --> 01:10:55.166
- Stop.
- You want me, too.

01:10:55.327 --> 01:10:56.442
That's enough!

01:10:56.607 --> 01:10:58.962
Because Paul's not here to join in?

01:11:00.287 --> 01:11:02.243
What game are you two playing?

01:11:02.887 --> 01:11:04.923
What game?

01:11:06.287 --> 01:11:08.198
Stop acting innocent.

01:11:10.927 --> 01:11:12.440
l know everything.

01:11:12.887 --> 01:11:14.957
Do you?

01:11:16.087 --> 01:11:19.204
You're using me to see
how far he'll go.

01:11:19.767 --> 01:11:21.564
What are you talking about?

01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:23.998
You're playing with fire.

01:11:24.287 --> 01:11:25.959
You have him in a corner.

01:11:26.127 --> 01:11:28.243
You're out of your mind.

01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:31.522
ls it to keep him or dump him?

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.678
What are you getting at?

01:11:34.247 --> 01:11:35.521
Deep down...

01:11:35.687 --> 01:11:38.360
ls it to test his love or yours?

01:11:41.647 --> 01:11:43.478
l hit it right on the head.

01:11:44.247 --> 01:11:47.000
A change of rules
throws you off-balance.

01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:50.083
You're not in control of things.

01:11:52.127 --> 01:11:54.004
You hadn't planned on that.

01:11:54.767 --> 01:11:59.887
You're nuts. lt's a typical male reaction
to accuse women to regain control.

01:12:00.327 --> 01:12:04.878
That how you expect to defeat men?
By destroying their safeguards?

01:12:05.047 --> 01:12:07.720
Defeat? We're not at war.

01:12:08.887 --> 01:12:10.718
The silent war of the sexes.

01:12:11.247 --> 01:12:15.081
A man's at a disadvantage
for not knowing what a woman is.

01:12:15.687 --> 01:12:19.441
While we know a man's secrets
because we created him.

01:12:20.807 --> 01:12:22.957
Try and uncover secrets,

01:12:23.767 --> 01:12:25.917
and they crumble away,

01:12:26.607 --> 01:12:28.404
leaving you naked.

01:12:32.887 --> 01:12:34.206
This'll get us nowhere.

01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:40.042
lt's the best place to return from.

01:12:42.727 --> 01:12:44.240
Think about yourself.

01:12:44.807 --> 01:12:46.399
About us.

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:49.483
Let Paul wallow in his anguish.

01:13:14.367 --> 01:13:16.164
<i>This season feels strange.</i>

01:13:17.367 --> 01:13:19.722
<i>lt's the best time of year,
back home.</i>

01:13:19.887 --> 01:13:22.401
<i>lt's like Christmas. lt's sacred.</i>

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.646
<i>lt's still mild.</i>

01:13:25.807 --> 01:13:28.879
<i>The leaves have changed color.
The vines, especially.</i>

01:13:29.047 --> 01:13:32.084
<i>Walking in the vineyards.
All those reds.</i>

01:13:32.247 --> 01:13:34.602
<i>And the yellowish green pine trees.</i>

01:13:34.967 --> 01:13:38.437
<i>l walk with my parents and talk.</i>

01:13:39.087 --> 01:13:40.918
<i>l'm afraid of what l might say.</i>

01:13:41.087 --> 01:13:44.523
<i>l watch them walk away,
or come toward me.</i>

01:13:45.407 --> 01:13:46.886
<i>They're so handsome!</i>

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:49.163
<i>They were young once.</i>

01:13:49.527 --> 01:13:52.599
<i>l want to hug them.</i>

01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:54.885
<i>To shout to them.</i>

01:13:56.247 --> 01:13:59.557
<i>What if we were dogs?
A family of dogs?</i>

01:14:00.247 --> 01:14:02.966
<i>You licked me so much
when l came out of you.</i>

01:14:03.127 --> 01:14:06.517
<i>And now l'm licking another dog.</i>

01:14:06.687 --> 01:14:09.645
<i>l licked his snout
and let him lick me all over.</i>

01:14:09.807 --> 01:14:14.085
<i>And because of that, you won't
take me by the neck and carry me?</i>

01:14:14.247 --> 01:14:16.761
<i>You'll bare your teeth?
We'll all look mad?</i>

01:14:16.927 --> 01:14:20.636
<i>We're not dogs. We're not even dogs.</i>

01:14:22.247 --> 01:14:24.283
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Thabor.</i>

01:14:24.447 --> 01:14:25.675
<i>Their son Paul</i>

01:14:26.487 --> 01:14:29.684
<i>is the graduate of a famous school.</i>

01:15:25.207 --> 01:15:26.322
You OK?

01:15:37.807 --> 01:15:38.956
Want one?

01:15:47.047 --> 01:15:48.844
Sleep well?

01:15:49.207 --> 01:15:51.038
l had such a strange dream.

01:15:55.527 --> 01:15:58.724
- Tell me about it.
- lt was...

01:15:59.127 --> 01:16:00.845
<i>like feeling weightless.</i>

01:16:02.087 --> 01:16:03.918
<i>They'd handcuffed me.</i>

01:16:20.327 --> 01:16:24.161
<i>One should know better
than to expect anything of mankind.</i>

01:16:24.327 --> 01:16:26.443
<i>Only one's own downfall.</i>

01:16:37.167 --> 01:16:38.646
<i>The soldiers separated us.</i>

01:16:38.847 --> 01:16:42.283
The chain around my neck was gone.
You had it now.

01:16:42.447 --> 01:16:43.766
l must give it to you.

01:16:43.927 --> 01:16:47.806
- But it's from your mother!
- Exactly. lt's precious to me.

01:16:50.007 --> 01:16:52.840
So long as you wear it,
l'll protect you.

01:16:53.767 --> 01:16:54.882
What will you say?

01:16:55.207 --> 01:16:57.960
That you lost it? Gave it away?

01:17:01.567 --> 01:17:04.479
You know, there's so much
l'd like to say.

01:17:05.527 --> 01:17:08.041
With parents, it's always too late.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:11.882
You realize you haven't
loved them enough or said enough.

01:17:12.727 --> 01:17:14.604
My mother, poor woman...

01:17:15.247 --> 01:17:18.080
l'll never earn enough
so she can quit.

01:17:18.807 --> 01:17:22.482
To send her on a trip.
All she knows is here and back home.

01:17:22.927 --> 01:17:25.999
She breaks her back
so you can sit on clean chairs.

01:17:32.967 --> 01:17:35.083
Would you let me meet your parents?

01:17:35.287 --> 01:17:38.006
- Why?
- Not even as a friend?

01:17:38.567 --> 01:17:42.276
You don't know my father.
Me having a worker as a friend!

01:17:42.527 --> 01:17:44.040
And an Arab, to boot.

01:17:44.207 --> 01:17:46.767
Say l'm from a famous school, too.

01:17:46.927 --> 01:17:48.883
Oh, yeah? Which one?

01:17:49.047 --> 01:17:51.322
Don't believe me? lt's nearby.

01:17:51.527 --> 01:17:53.677
- What're you talking about?
- C'mon.

01:18:04.007 --> 01:18:05.884
- There it is.
- But that's life!

01:18:06.087 --> 01:18:08.123
Right! lt's the best school.

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:10.399
l worked on a site here.

01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:12.479
l learned a lot.

01:18:13.247 --> 01:18:16.956
Open your eyes.
Look at things differently. Observe.

01:19:20.007 --> 01:19:23.124
- What a fabulous place!
- And there's more to it.

01:19:23.287 --> 01:19:25.642
- You been here before?
- No!

01:19:29.087 --> 01:19:30.486
Now it's gone!

01:19:35.767 --> 01:19:37.439
Cut your card tricks!

01:19:38.247 --> 01:19:40.556
Mrs. Réal, Paul Thabor...

01:19:40.727 --> 01:19:42.206
His friend, Agnes.

01:19:44.367 --> 01:19:48.519
- Your husband isn't here?
- He's stuck in Brussels. He's sorry.

01:19:48.687 --> 01:19:50.996
So you're my son's roommate.

01:19:51.647 --> 01:19:53.842
Such an interest in my father!

01:19:54.007 --> 01:19:56.043
We didn't need him.

01:20:07.167 --> 01:20:08.885
Happy birthday, honey.

01:20:28.927 --> 01:20:30.406
My darling!

01:20:40.927 --> 01:20:43.725
- What're you doing?
- We'll find a bedroom.

01:20:43.887 --> 01:20:47.243
- No, not here.
- Yes, here. ln his home.

01:20:47.407 --> 01:20:48.601
C'mon...

01:21:26.847 --> 01:21:28.439
ls this yours?

01:21:28.607 --> 01:21:29.722
lt was a gift.

01:21:29.887 --> 01:21:31.764
From whom? Louis-Arnault?

01:21:32.127 --> 01:21:33.924
Sure, from Louis-Arnault.

01:21:34.087 --> 01:21:37.238
Come here, Louis-Arnault.
l want you, Louis-Arnault.

01:21:38.047 --> 01:21:39.878
You and your Louis-Arnault!

01:21:41.927 --> 01:21:43.645
lt's literally intoxicating.

01:21:45.127 --> 01:21:46.799
So be nice.

01:21:47.847 --> 01:21:49.997
We're not into exchanging gifts.

01:21:50.167 --> 01:21:52.283
lt's his birthday, not mine.

01:21:54.767 --> 01:21:56.723
lt's a gift from me.

01:21:56.887 --> 01:21:59.355
l gave myself one since
you never do.

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:01.356
Dummy.

01:22:01.767 --> 01:22:05.601
lt's true. l was walking by a store.
The chain saw me.

01:22:05.767 --> 01:22:07.758
lt said: Come in!

01:22:10.127 --> 01:22:12.436
l'll bring you happiness.

01:22:12.607 --> 01:22:14.723
Just wear me around your neck.

01:22:14.887 --> 01:22:18.323
l'll protect you.
l'll love you forever.

01:22:31.167 --> 01:22:34.125
- Where've you been?
- Relax, l'm not late.

01:22:34.887 --> 01:22:37.845
- You OK? What is it?
- l argued with Dad.

01:22:38.087 --> 01:22:41.477
He gets me down.
He says musician isn't a job.

01:22:41.687 --> 01:22:44.804
- He doesn't believe in me.
- He wants you to succeed.

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:48.039
l don't want to admit
no one cares about me.

01:22:48.207 --> 01:22:51.165
- Cut the paranoia.
- That's exactly paranoia.

01:22:51.367 --> 01:22:53.244
You resent others

01:22:53.407 --> 01:22:56.160
to forget that you mean
nothing to them.

01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:58.565
Believe in yourself first!

01:22:58.727 --> 01:23:01.446
Then you'll see others differently.

01:23:02.127 --> 01:23:04.004
l believe in what l do.

01:23:04.567 --> 01:23:07.684
That's what gives me fire,
it gives me strength.

01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:37.395
Where to?

01:23:37.927 --> 01:23:39.679
Just drive along the river.

01:23:39.847 --> 01:23:41.485
You sure?

01:25:07.967 --> 01:25:10.242
Keep it down.
You'll wake the others.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.245
How'd you get in?

01:25:14.687 --> 01:25:16.518
Paul gave me the key.

01:25:16.807 --> 01:25:19.037
But l didn't come to see him.

01:25:19.967 --> 01:25:22.162
l was sure you'd hear me.

01:25:24.167 --> 01:25:25.919
Changed your mind?

01:25:29.087 --> 01:25:31.078
But l have no choice now.

01:25:31.807 --> 01:25:33.923
l have to see it through.

01:25:34.847 --> 01:25:35.996
For him.

01:25:36.167 --> 01:25:38.727
For me. For us.

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:41.881
Through me he gets
what he wants from you.

01:25:42.047 --> 01:25:44.561
Funny alibi.
lt won't change anything.

01:25:44.727 --> 01:25:48.515
- You can't understand.
- Then call him so he can see us.

01:25:48.687 --> 01:25:50.279
Emeline's here too.

01:25:50.647 --> 01:25:53.525
Yes, but she's sleeping. Like Paul.

01:25:54.127 --> 01:25:56.038
He's asleep, too.

01:25:56.567 --> 01:25:59.684
Only you woke up.
l knew you would.

01:26:01.447 --> 01:26:03.881
So the inevitable could happen.

01:26:16.247 --> 01:26:17.839
Come to bed now.

01:26:18.847 --> 01:26:22.886
l missed the stabbing.
So l lose you for being a bit late?

01:26:23.047 --> 01:26:25.607
Lose me?
After 20 years of marriage, maybe.

01:26:25.767 --> 01:26:28.679
- And our private life?
- No reason to make a scene.

01:26:28.847 --> 01:26:32.123
A scene? Did you forget
everything between us?

01:26:33.447 --> 01:26:35.199
l know what's between us.

01:26:36.127 --> 01:26:39.039
Sex joins but it doesn't commit you.

01:26:39.207 --> 01:26:40.117
Excuse me?

01:26:40.287 --> 01:26:42.847
Sex is a world apart.
Like Greek or Math.

01:26:43.007 --> 01:26:44.679
l'm not talking to you.

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:48.839
Let's just say he wanted me
and l wanted him.

01:26:50.207 --> 01:26:53.597
And my desire?
You haven't always spurned it.

01:26:53.767 --> 01:26:57.203
We're joined.
By being joined we're committed.

01:26:57.367 --> 01:26:59.722
There are feelings binding us.

01:26:59.887 --> 01:27:02.196
And there's a difference
of sensibility.

01:27:02.367 --> 01:27:04.517
Not even. Of talent. Dexterity.

01:27:04.807 --> 01:27:07.879
She may have more talent
for expressing feelings.

01:27:08.047 --> 01:27:09.321
Or for hiding them.

01:27:09.487 --> 01:27:13.162
Maybe she has no feelings.
She's just playing a game.

01:27:14.767 --> 01:27:16.644
Play is all she can do.

01:27:16.887 --> 01:27:18.843
We're always playing
someone's game.

01:27:19.007 --> 01:27:22.522
Don't they teach you to play
with people to dominate them?

01:27:22.687 --> 01:27:26.282
He isn't playing!
Are you, Louis-Arnault?

01:27:26.887 --> 01:27:28.445
Answer me.

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:31.682
Am l playing? Look at me!

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:35.522
You had to turn up now
to make this scene...

01:27:36.207 --> 01:27:37.845
This impossible scene!

01:28:00.287 --> 01:28:03.438
You don't talk,
but you make yourself understood.

01:28:03.607 --> 01:28:07.043
Nice speech about spurned desire.
What a Freudian slip!

01:28:07.207 --> 01:28:10.005
l shouldn't have come.
Lucky she came in.

01:28:10.167 --> 01:28:12.806
There are things that kill desire.

01:28:12.967 --> 01:28:14.480
l'm leaving.

01:28:15.727 --> 01:28:18.002
<i>Wait for the first train at 6.</i>

01:28:18.767 --> 01:28:20.644
- Paul won't know.
- Won't he?

01:28:20.807 --> 01:28:22.365
Then everything's fine.

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:34.125
For your taxi.

01:28:34.287 --> 01:28:37.563
Oh, right!
l don't pay, l didn't have anything.

01:28:39.727 --> 01:28:42.605
lf you change your mind,
there's Scotch tape.

01:29:21.407 --> 01:29:23.762
<i>- Going to the Normale Sup party?
- No.</i>

01:29:23.927 --> 01:29:26.760
- We go together or l don't go.
- Why not?

01:29:26.927 --> 01:29:28.519
Agnes is your girlfriend.

01:29:29.007 --> 01:29:30.565
And your best friend.

01:29:30.727 --> 01:29:34.276
Sure. She has to be either
a girlfriend or a best friend.

01:29:34.447 --> 01:29:36.517
Funny way to talk.

01:29:36.687 --> 01:29:39.918
Who'd want to be a girlfriend
when she can be a best friend?

01:29:40.087 --> 01:29:43.796
Yet when the word 'friend' follows,
what's best is obvious.

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:46.480
What'd she say?

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:49.036
- About what?
- About me.

01:29:49.807 --> 01:29:52.321
You two did the talking
the other night.

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:54.045
ls that it?

01:29:54.207 --> 01:29:55.959
No other factors?

01:29:56.127 --> 01:29:57.640
Like what?

01:29:58.247 --> 01:30:01.159
You're on the wrong track.
And forgetting Emeline.

01:30:35.527 --> 01:30:37.438
Nice of you to visit.

01:30:39.087 --> 01:30:41.555
- A mere coincidence.
- l don't doubt it.

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:49.005
- We've met?
- On campus. Painting.

01:30:49.167 --> 01:30:50.759
That's right.

01:30:50.927 --> 01:30:52.076
What brings you here?

01:30:52.327 --> 01:30:55.239
The library. And you?

01:30:55.407 --> 01:30:59.480
l'm working as a mason on this site.
But l told you that!

01:31:00.167 --> 01:31:02.806
lt's my break. Want to have a drink?

01:31:02.967 --> 01:31:04.241
Why not?

01:31:04.407 --> 01:31:06.125
l'm waiting for my brother.

01:31:06.727 --> 01:31:09.400
There's a café nearby.
Here he comes.

01:31:11.127 --> 01:31:12.685
How're things?

01:31:13.967 --> 01:31:15.480
This is Paul.

01:31:16.247 --> 01:31:17.680
l think we've met.

01:31:20.247 --> 01:31:21.805
What're you doing?

01:31:22.007 --> 01:31:24.202
He's the guy who stabbed me!

01:31:24.367 --> 01:31:25.880
l didn't do anything!

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:27.446
Stop! He's my brother!

01:31:27.647 --> 01:31:30.445
- l recognize him!
- You got the wrong man!

01:31:34.807 --> 01:31:35.842
l'm OK, let me go.

01:31:36.007 --> 01:31:38.885
lt's not him.
He couldn't do a thing like that.

01:31:39.047 --> 01:31:40.605
Leave me alone.

01:32:08.047 --> 01:32:10.038
- Let me explain.
- Explain what?

01:32:10.207 --> 01:32:13.165
- You let him go.
- You don't get it!

01:32:13.367 --> 01:32:15.722
- lt was for you.
- l did get it.

01:32:16.927 --> 01:32:19.805
<i>My shorts aren't enough.
You sleep with that!</i>

01:32:25.207 --> 01:32:27.721
You know l love you

01:32:28.167 --> 01:32:29.646
and you said nothing?

01:32:30.727 --> 01:32:32.080
ln your opinion,

01:32:32.247 --> 01:32:34.317
what would l do if l loved you?

01:32:35.207 --> 01:32:37.038
What would l do?

01:32:57.007 --> 01:32:58.281
C'mon! lt's pointless.

01:32:58.447 --> 01:33:00.119
Leave me alone.

01:33:00.287 --> 01:33:03.324
My brother couldn't have!
He'd have told me.

01:33:03.487 --> 01:33:06.001
Him or another,
it doesn't matter now.

01:33:10.207 --> 01:33:12.243
Don't cry.

01:33:12.527 --> 01:33:15.325
lt's not worth it.
See how he treated you?

01:33:15.487 --> 01:33:18.718
Stop it! You'll ruin everything.

01:33:19.687 --> 01:33:22.759
- You can't prefer him!
- This isn't the time.

01:33:23.607 --> 01:33:26.804
He lied to separate us,
to break with you.

01:33:27.407 --> 01:33:29.762
l'm here... to protect you.

01:33:31.847 --> 01:33:33.599
- That's enough.
- No, don't!

01:33:34.447 --> 01:33:35.596
Keep it.

01:33:35.807 --> 01:33:37.399
lt's no good to me now.

01:33:37.727 --> 01:33:39.604
Don't part with it.

01:33:40.687 --> 01:33:42.405
Tell me l'll see you again.

01:33:42.567 --> 01:33:45.764
We'll keep going.
You can lie to me, but say it.

01:33:47.367 --> 01:33:48.436
We'll see.

01:33:48.967 --> 01:33:50.958
l'm so confused.

01:33:52.367 --> 01:33:53.800
l need to be alone.

01:33:54.767 --> 01:33:56.041
Alone.

01:34:00.447 --> 01:34:02.483
You mean a lot to me.

01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:04.320
l love you.

01:34:51.207 --> 01:34:52.401
So it's come to this?

01:34:52.567 --> 01:34:54.364
Why are you so surprised?

01:34:54.727 --> 01:34:58.276
He's moving in with me.
ls it so hard to understand?

01:34:58.447 --> 01:35:00.244
lt's obviously easy for you.

01:35:00.767 --> 01:35:02.758
You weren't so sure that night.

01:35:02.927 --> 01:35:04.485
There's no connection.

01:35:04.647 --> 01:35:07.081
l knew Agnes wanted Louis-Arnault.

01:35:07.487 --> 01:35:08.761
l put things in order.

01:35:13.167 --> 01:35:17.240
The Louis-Arnault you dreamed about...
you lost him that night.

01:35:17.527 --> 01:35:20.883
You don't know him.
You can't imagine.

01:35:21.047 --> 01:35:24.198
lmagine what? Your reconciliation?

01:35:24.367 --> 01:35:27.040
How he held you?
How gentle he was?

01:35:27.247 --> 01:35:30.125
How touching? How he promised?

01:35:30.287 --> 01:35:31.640
How he almost cried?

01:35:31.847 --> 01:35:33.280
l can imagine it!

01:35:33.447 --> 01:35:35.642
- You talk about him as if...
- Yes.

01:35:48.247 --> 01:35:50.078
l wondered what you were up to.

01:35:50.247 --> 01:35:51.885
l was about to leave.

01:35:52.567 --> 01:35:54.876
l figured you couldn't carry it all.

01:35:58.767 --> 01:36:00.166
Find a place?

01:36:00.327 --> 01:36:03.524
l'll be at Emeline's.
Or at my folks.

01:36:03.687 --> 01:36:05.166
You can stay with me.

01:36:05.327 --> 01:36:07.283
l didn't see you at the party.

01:36:07.447 --> 01:36:09.199
We weren't up to it.

01:36:09.367 --> 01:36:11.039
- Was it fun?
- Terrific.

01:36:11.247 --> 01:36:14.284
Lit students have a ball.
Agnes danced like crazy.

01:36:14.487 --> 01:36:16.159
The white knight is back?

01:36:17.127 --> 01:36:19.357
Speak of the devil.
What a coincidence.

01:36:19.527 --> 01:36:20.960
So it seemed.

01:36:21.127 --> 01:36:23.243
l didn't expect you this weekend.

01:36:23.407 --> 01:36:25.796
Neither did l. The weekend's over.

01:36:25.967 --> 01:36:28.037
Amazing we're up after last night.

01:36:28.207 --> 01:36:29.560
l didn't go to bed.

01:36:29.727 --> 01:36:31.445
lt's not the first time.

01:36:32.567 --> 01:36:37.004
l went to the movies. A couple
were making love next to me.

01:36:39.647 --> 01:36:41.080
Basically, you see...

01:36:41.247 --> 01:36:44.159
The dream life you're planning...

01:36:44.327 --> 01:36:47.285
may not be very admirable
or very virile.

01:36:47.447 --> 01:36:49.961
- What was that?
- He doesn't mean you.

01:36:50.127 --> 01:36:52.925
l may have a dated sense
of chivalry...

01:36:53.087 --> 01:36:55.555
- Chivalry?
- What's he mean?

01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:58.446
- The crusades, probably.
- lsn't that it?

01:36:58.607 --> 01:37:00.802
Being good in finance,

01:37:00.967 --> 01:37:05.006
looking down on marketing...
lt's all a bit common, isn't it?

01:37:05.167 --> 01:37:06.646
And you talk of virility?

01:37:06.807 --> 01:37:09.924
We used to understand each other,
we were in synch.

01:37:10.087 --> 01:37:12.282
Then your eyes shone for Nabisco...

01:37:12.447 --> 01:37:15.007
- What d'you mean by ''virility''?
- Financier,

01:37:15.167 --> 01:37:18.045
corporate lawyer
in an international firm.

01:37:18.367 --> 01:37:21.120
Meals, contracts,
seminars, executive dinners,

01:37:21.287 --> 01:37:25.644
call girls, soundproof hotel rooms
with champagne in the mini-bar...

01:37:25.807 --> 01:37:27.604
Life... Life!

01:37:28.847 --> 01:37:31.486
Answer him!

01:37:31.647 --> 01:37:35.640
What's left for us
if guys like you can't answer him?

01:37:36.887 --> 01:37:38.878
What do you want me to do?

01:37:40.167 --> 01:37:41.759
Punch him in the face?

01:37:41.927 --> 01:37:44.600
Are you so pathetic
you have nothing to say?

01:37:44.767 --> 01:37:47.884
Can't you see
he's missing the heart of the issue?

01:37:48.807 --> 01:37:52.482
Negotiations,
psychological warfare, secrets,

01:37:52.647 --> 01:37:55.639
strategies, signatures,
victory, noble things!

01:37:55.807 --> 01:37:57.559
Can't you tell him that?

01:38:00.287 --> 01:38:01.402
And you, Paul?

01:38:01.567 --> 01:38:05.276
What will you do that's so great?
You'll fall in line.

01:38:07.967 --> 01:38:11.437
You're both the same:
always dissecting things.

01:38:11.607 --> 01:38:14.167
You wouldn't mind
if he punched him out.

01:38:14.327 --> 01:38:16.966
But it's Paul
who used the word ''virile.''

01:38:17.127 --> 01:38:19.846
Yes, l did.
l'm not sure you heard it.

01:38:20.007 --> 01:38:21.884
And that changes its meaning?

01:38:22.047 --> 01:38:26.165
So your dear Emeline
can express an idea, after all.

01:38:26.327 --> 01:38:28.238
You should manage, too.

01:39:16.167 --> 01:39:17.486
Well?

01:39:25.167 --> 01:39:26.361
Got what you wanted?

01:39:26.567 --> 01:39:28.398
l could've had him.

01:39:29.207 --> 01:39:31.357
- But you didn't.
- l hesitated.

01:39:31.567 --> 01:39:34.286
- Because of your bet?
- You were in on it?

01:39:34.487 --> 01:39:35.920
- And you?
- lt was for you.

01:39:36.087 --> 01:39:38.237
- Even that night?
- You heard it all?

01:39:38.967 --> 01:39:41.720
- lmpossible not to.
- Bernard slept through it.

01:39:42.247 --> 01:39:44.238
Chouquet uses earplugs.

01:39:44.407 --> 01:39:47.080
And those airplane eye masks.

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:49.807
He barricades his head to sleep.

01:39:50.327 --> 01:39:51.555
Emeline woke me.

01:39:52.327 --> 01:39:54.887
You'd have gone on but
she walked in.

01:39:55.047 --> 01:39:57.117
l would have done it for you.

01:39:57.327 --> 01:40:00.524
You'd have won by saying:
l had him!

01:40:01.807 --> 01:40:03.957
Well, l did have him.

01:40:04.487 --> 01:40:05.966
What?

01:40:06.327 --> 01:40:07.442
l had Louis-Arnault.

01:40:07.687 --> 01:40:09.803
- What?
- As l told you.

01:40:11.447 --> 01:40:13.642
Liar! Bernard said you argued.

01:40:13.967 --> 01:40:15.480
That's why.

01:40:15.647 --> 01:40:18.878
He came home drunk Thursday,
looking for me.

01:40:19.327 --> 01:40:22.319
And you took advantage.
Want me to believe that?

01:40:22.487 --> 01:40:23.966
That's right.

01:40:24.447 --> 01:40:26.915
Why would he drink?
lt's not like him.

01:40:27.087 --> 01:40:29.726
As an excuse
for what he was going to do.

01:40:29.887 --> 01:40:33.721
He did nothing. l'm almost positive
he doesn't want anything.

01:40:33.887 --> 01:40:35.923
You're right to say 'àlmost.''

01:40:36.567 --> 01:40:38.285
So he came looking for you?

01:40:38.447 --> 01:40:41.723
He wanted to check his notes
against mine.

01:40:42.167 --> 01:40:43.805
We looked at the case.

01:40:43.967 --> 01:40:46.527
He dropped his hand, let it wander.

01:40:47.887 --> 01:40:51.277
lt's not true.
He's not at all like that.

01:40:51.687 --> 01:40:55.566
But in male sexuality,
there's something automatic.

01:40:55.887 --> 01:40:57.036
Automatic?

01:40:57.207 --> 01:40:59.721
lt doesn't matter
whose hand does the stroking,

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:01.718
if all you want is a reaction.

01:41:02.927 --> 01:41:04.838
Thanks for the details!

01:41:05.567 --> 01:41:08.957
The details say more
than all the rest.

01:41:13.007 --> 01:41:15.919
The gesture explains
the step one takes.

01:41:16.887 --> 01:41:20.800
So what you do when we're together
is just automatic?

01:41:20.967 --> 01:41:22.719
You know it isn't.

01:41:23.767 --> 01:41:26.998
Louis-Arnault won't try it again.

01:41:27.167 --> 01:41:28.839
But just once in his life.

01:41:29.007 --> 01:41:32.079
You made the rules:
once was enough.

01:41:32.287 --> 01:41:33.925
l don't believe you.

01:41:34.527 --> 01:41:36.677
l don't believe a word of all this.

01:41:36.847 --> 01:41:39.042
You have to take my word for it.

01:41:39.647 --> 01:41:43.037
So it's all said and done?
You got what you wanted?

01:41:44.607 --> 01:41:46.757
Say we haven't lost everything.

01:41:47.607 --> 01:41:49.199
l don't know.

01:41:50.407 --> 01:41:53.205
We have something between us.

01:41:53.367 --> 01:41:55.358
Our complicity.

01:41:56.247 --> 01:41:58.602
You say things that are rarely said.

01:41:59.247 --> 01:42:03.957
Between a man and a woman, we invent
nothing more than what binds us.

01:42:04.767 --> 01:42:07.156
We invent... desire.

01:42:08.287 --> 01:42:10.562
Maybe we should come back to that.

01:42:35.567 --> 01:42:39.196
<i>l want to be able to choose
so as not to have to choose.</i>

01:43:20.487 --> 01:43:22.557
<i>Now l walk</i>

01:43:22.767 --> 01:43:26.885
<i>with my head in the stars,
to keep my tears from falling.</i>
