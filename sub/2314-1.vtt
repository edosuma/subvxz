<i>Kristy.</i>

02:23.781 --> 02:25.573
<i>Kristy.</i>

02:27.652 --> 02:31.602
<i>Police are still searching for 21 year old
college student, Heather Price,</i>

02:31.722 --> 02:36.048
<i>reported missing three days ago after
leaving a friend's house in Mills Fall.</i>

02:36.168 --> 02:39.471
<i>At the time of her disappearance,
Price was wearing a striped sweater,</i>

02:39.562 --> 02:41.344
<i>dark blue jeans and sneakers.</i>

02:41.431 --> 02:43.078
<i>Anyone who may have...</i>

02:45.908 --> 02:47.274
Help me!

02:47.520 --> 02:48.993
Help me!

03:12.122 --> 03:13.569
<i>The time is now.</i>

03:15.796 --> 03:17.775
<i>Kill Kristy.</i>

03:19.235 --> 03:22.101
<i>Kristy is a strong word of Christ.</i>

03:22.880 --> 03:26.376
<i>You kristy Kill,
you kill God .</i>

03:29.553 --> 03:31.263
<i>Kristy is pretty,</i>

03:32.056 --> 03:33.312
<i>pure,</i>

03:33.986 --> 03:35.199

03:41.510 --> 03:42.766

03:53.538 --> 03:55.138
<i>Know their fears.</i>

04:17.397 --> 04:19.273

04:26.828 --> 04:28.711
<i>More will follow.</i>

04:35.136 --> 04:36.752
<i>They are weak.</i>

04:45.106 --> 04:49.661
<i>They are Kristy.</i>

05:00.553 --> 05:03.153
"To see the world in a grain of sand"

05:03.340 --> 05:05.780
"And a heaven in a wild flower"

05:06.227 --> 05:08.980
"Hold infinity in the palm of your hand"

05:09.358 --> 05:11.158
"And eternity in an hour"

05:11.983 --> 05:14.443
"A robin redbreast in a cage"

05:14.743 --> 05:15.743
"Puts..."

05:15.863 --> 05:19.406
- You're so immature.
- I'm laughing because you sound so bored.

05:19.459 --> 05:21.566
I'm not bored, I just...

05:22.200 --> 05:24.203
I don't get how to break it down.

05:24.319 --> 05:26.170
It's poetry, you nerd.

05:26.270 --> 05:27.377
Not mass.

05:27.456 --> 05:29.117
Did you just call me a nerd?

05:29.192 --> 05:29.937
Yeah.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.533
It's not an equation, it's an experience.

05:35.110 --> 05:38.310
As far as poetry goes,
Blake is pretty a bad ass.

05:38.907 --> 05:40.507
You just need to...

05:40.990 --> 05:43.056
embrace it a little more.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.443
We are not all future novelists.

05:46.869 --> 05:48.459
Future novelist?

05:50.077 --> 05:51.126
I like that.

05:51.740 --> 05:54.196
Ok, well, I can't get
a B in this class.

05:54.243 --> 05:56.585
I have to keep my ecademic scholarship.

05:56.705 --> 06:00.576
- It'll be fine. I'll help you through it.
- No, you think I've a headstart, remember?

06:02.901 --> 06:05.168
Come on.
You're the one who opted out.

06:05.291 --> 06:07.656
Aaron, it's fine.
I got laid, you can go.

06:07.776 --> 06:09.554
I'll bring Nicole if you want.

06:09.674 --> 06:11.554
It's silly that you guys are staying here.

06:12.077 --> 06:15.453
You think a long weekend
girl time is silly?

06:15.627 --> 06:17.180
Actually, it's kind of hot.

06:17.290 --> 06:19.305
Yeah, and you're gonna miss it all.
Now, get off the bed.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.246
I don't think so.

06:35.368 --> 06:38.611
Heisenberg was all about
unforeseen outcome.

06:38.671 --> 06:42.751
Light fending, sodium nitrate
exploding with water...

06:43.201 --> 06:44.008
Boom!

06:44.161 --> 06:46.718
That sounds like
an unexpected outcome to me. Yes?

06:53.867 --> 06:57.477
Oh, I know, Mom. We talked about this.
The flights are so expensive.

06:57.573 --> 07:00.323
No, they always jack it up
for the Thanksgiving.

07:01.389 --> 07:03.286
I said they jack it up.

07:03.492 --> 07:06.998
No, I'll be fine until Christmas.
You have Tammy and the baby.

07:08.279 --> 07:09.872
Want these lights on, Justine?

07:09.996 --> 07:10.929
Oh, uh...

07:11.075 --> 07:13.692
No, you can turn them off.
I'm almost done.

07:14.182 --> 07:15.898
Just come. She won't bother us.
I swear.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.648
Aaron, don't you remember the 4th of July

07:17.688 --> 07:20.675
when she asked me how
my dishwashing program was going?

07:21.010 --> 07:22.245
She doesn't get works done.

07:22.285 --> 07:25.132
Oh, does she understand that
some people have to work for a living?

07:25.171 --> 07:26.518
Jus!...
Stop.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.857
I swear to God,
you can be so stubborn.

07:30.061 --> 07:31.670
You just tell me what you want.

07:33.197 --> 07:34.630
I want you to stay.

07:35.941 --> 07:37.041
With me.

07:38.026 --> 07:39.226
Just one time.

07:41.469 --> 07:42.991
You know my family.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.022
I have to go home.

07:45.142 --> 07:48.292
Einstein saw order in the universe

07:48.319 --> 07:50.779
and believe that
nothing happens by a chance.

07:50.839 --> 07:52.032
Whereas...

07:52.237 --> 07:55.644
Heiserberg believed that
the world was inherently chaotic,

07:55.889 --> 07:57.693
more random.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.636
I miss you guys too.

08:00.916 --> 08:02.090
Hey, Jus!

08:04.163 --> 08:07.576
Oh, it's just...
It's Scott, the groundskeeper.

08:10.201 --> 08:11.901
Don't work too hard, huh?

08:14.205 --> 08:14.955
Okay.

08:15.250 --> 08:18.450
- Have a happy Thanksgiving.
- You too, Creg.

08:18.975 --> 08:23.525
I think the Einstein quote was:
"God does not play dice with the universe."

08:23.711 --> 08:25.559
And in Heisenberg's world,...

08:25.844 --> 08:27.811
God does roll the dice.

08:29.363 --> 08:30.392
Say it.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.639
Say what?

08:32.924 --> 08:33.919
You know what.

08:41.072 --> 08:43.825
You can't corner me with technology.

08:44.685 --> 08:46.712
- Say it.
- Aaron, come on.

08:47.055 --> 08:48.301
I love you.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.591
I love you, Justine.

09:04.089 --> 09:05.239
Be safe.

09:20.077 --> 09:20.862
Go.

09:31.566 --> 09:32.425
Bye.

10:50.669 --> 10:53.404
- Hey, Wayne, how are you doing?
- Hey! Must stay behind.

10:53.464 --> 10:56.266
Doing my laundry
before I hit the book.

11:31.746 --> 11:33.878
- Oh, oh!
- I am so sorry.

11:33.998 --> 11:35.747
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.070
No, it's just this basement...

11:38.190 --> 11:40.350
So, and...and this'
gonna give us all weekend?

11:40.390 --> 11:41.877
Yeah, that's what I heard.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.160
God...

11:44.041 --> 11:45.463
Oh, okay uh...

11:45.616 --> 11:46.210
Phew!

11:46.243 --> 11:48.656
So... you have room for one more?

11:49.270 --> 11:50.181
Thanks.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.483
- And don't forget the red wine?
- Uh, no. That's just the given.

11:53.532 --> 11:54.370
Bye.

11:57.212 --> 11:59.855
<i>...smashed that
there was one on the tire.</i>

11:59.935 --> 12:04.242
<i>Investigators said her personal items
were found in several dumpsters.</i>

12:04.412 --> 12:06.602
<i>Officers are canvassing the area.</i>

12:06.678 --> 12:09.954
<i>They won't comment whether
there is a connection...</i>

12:10.028 --> 12:12.321
<i>with her 4th or 5th this place.</i>

12:15.199 --> 12:16.548
Hi, Anna.

12:16.754 --> 12:18.015
Are you going back to London?

12:18.101 --> 12:19.901
No, just friends up states.

12:20.021 --> 12:22.461
You and Nicole are
really staying behind?

12:22.514 --> 12:25.314
Yeah, uh, turkey pot pie away.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.420
- Dasvidania!
- Happy Thanksgiving!

12:28.960 --> 12:30.520
Yeah, all good.

12:30.928 --> 12:32.238
Dad, I know.

12:32.988 --> 12:34.688
Dad, I'll be cool to cease school.

12:35.410 --> 12:37.098
Ok, I'll see you soon.

12:37.746 --> 12:38.496
Love.

12:39.322 --> 12:40.155
No.

12:40.856 --> 12:42.862
Please, don't kill me.
My dad is back.

12:42.915 --> 12:46.082
He surpriseed the family.
He wants to spend the holidays in Aspen.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.205
The car is on its way.

12:48.578 --> 12:49.645
Come with me.

12:49.771 --> 12:51.564
I get another plane ticket.

12:51.658 --> 12:53.684
You can't stay here all by yourself.

12:54.099 --> 12:54.932
Jus!

12:55.146 --> 12:57.156
It's okay.
I'm fine, really.

12:58.122 --> 13:00.896
I'm so sorry. I swear
I wanted to hang out with you.

13:00.922 --> 13:03.069
Since my dad takes a break
from the campagne,

13:03.102 --> 13:05.585
and the whole family's gonna be together.
And then like Aspen!

13:05.630 --> 13:07.530
Nicole, I understand.
That's fine.

13:07.590 --> 13:09.112
Family is family.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.063
And promise me
you will get off this campus.

13:12.103 --> 13:14.530
Get some fresh air somewhere away.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.509
Here.

13:16.516 --> 13:17.379
Take my baby.

13:17.452 --> 13:19.152
I don't even want to breath
on your BMW.

13:19.192 --> 13:20.555
Oh, please, use it!

13:20.646 --> 13:22.346
You know you want to.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.016
Thanks.

13:24.795 --> 13:26.475
Oh, come here.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.802
- You'll be safe, okay?
- Ok.

13:30.942 --> 13:32.396
- Thank you.
- Uh huh.

13:32.563 --> 13:33.444
- OK.
- Bye.

13:33.518 --> 13:35.065
Hey, last chance.

13:35.332 --> 13:36.365
Oh.

13:38.203 --> 13:39.107
Thanks.

13:40.339 --> 13:41.279
Bye.

13:44.652 --> 13:46.397
See you after Thanksgiving.

13:46.488 --> 13:48.162
Thanks for BMW!

14:01.408 --> 14:05.484
<i>Good morning and happy Thanksgiving
from everyon here at 106.5.</i>

14:05.538 --> 14:08.344
<i>That's right. I hope everyone is spending
with their family and friends.</i>

14:08.385 --> 14:09.385
<i>What do you think, Jimbo?</i>

14:09.425 --> 14:12.944
<i>Oh, Manny. It is a beautiful morning,
perfect for Thanksgiving.</i>

14:13.064 --> 14:15.920
<i>But you are all yet beyond for
some rain later this eveningt,</i>

14:15.960 --> 14:18.267
<i>just about the time everyone should be...</i>

14:21.393 --> 14:23.693
<i>- Let it rain.
- Let it rain, let it rain.</i>

15:56.486 --> 15:57.274
Hey.

15:57.504 --> 15:58.934
No, I'm having fun.

15:59.054 --> 16:01.677
Nicole just went out to market night
to get some more snacks.

16:02.691 --> 16:03.991
How's dinner?

16:04.503 --> 16:06.777
Um... turkey pot pie,

16:06.935 --> 16:09.631
red wine, proper holiday feast.

16:10.661 --> 16:12.961
We're saving the wine for later.

16:14.549 --> 16:15.685
I don't know.

16:15.879 --> 16:18.079
I really have a hard time
with that one.

16:20.815 --> 16:23.415
Oh, it's very quiet here.
It's very peaceful.

17:23.145 --> 17:24.388
What the hell!

17:30.864 --> 17:32.734
Hey, Wayne, those lights flash.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.307
Yeah. Oh, just some shift.
They're running the wire.

17:35.374 --> 17:37.507
Crews won't be back until Monday.

17:38.924 --> 17:39.990
Ah!

17:40.071 --> 17:42.030
Taking Nicolle's little pony
out for a spin?

17:42.150 --> 17:43.014
Yep.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.971
Max or Ben & Jerry's calling my name.

17:46.091 --> 17:47.092
Oh, copy that.

17:47.212 --> 17:49.862
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm cool.

17:50.220 --> 17:53.120
Are you sure?
You're my Thanksgiving bud.

17:54.703 --> 17:55.653
Mountain Dew,

17:56.148 --> 17:57.492
pumpkin pie.

17:57.632 --> 17:59.832
Soda and pumpkin pie.
Done.

18:00.546 --> 18:04.148
Hey, uh, make sure David at the gates knows
that you all stay behind.

18:04.695 --> 18:06.971
OK. Thanks, Wayne.
Bye.

18:43.877 --> 18:46.597
Hi. I'm Justine Wills and
I stay behind.

18:46.703 --> 18:48.243
All right.
You got your swipe?

18:48.391 --> 18:49.091
Yeah.

18:49.269 --> 18:51.170
Because, I'm gonna close
the gates in an hour.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.493
Oh, it's okay.
I'll be back in 20.

18:53.613 --> 18:54.646
Thanks.

19:09.144 --> 19:11.208
<i>No one Heather Price story answers bells.</i>

19:11.328 --> 19:13.640
<i>On the lighter note,
early shoppers standing in line</i>

19:13.687 --> 19:17.420
<i>for those Black Friday sales will need
plenty of tents and strong umbrellas,</i>

<i>because we got some nasty weather

21:40.959 --> 21:41.809
Thank you.

21:44.601 --> 21:46.151
I like your car.

21:51.860 --> 21:53.248
You're so pretty.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.763
Student, right?

22:00.883 --> 22:01.668
Yeah.

22:12.292 --> 22:15.659
Yo, Rockstar. If you're not gonna
buy anthing, you need to boogie.

22:19.292 --> 22:21.342
How much are these glasses?

22:21.758 --> 22:23.610
What does price tag say?

22:27.525 --> 22:29.115
I want a discount.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.241
Let's see your ID.

22:36.369 --> 22:38.200
I want a discount.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.120
Hey, look, I'll pay.

22:42.082 --> 22:43.131
I'll pay.

22:46.357 --> 22:48.114
I don't want anything from you.

22:51.017 --> 22:54.967
All right. Trying to do something nice
to someone and this the shit you get.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.300
You don't know what shit is.

23:01.988 --> 23:02.900
Kristy.

23:04.268 --> 23:05.668
You are in one.

24:23.747 --> 24:24.934
Jesus!

25:45.291 --> 25:46.384
Hey!

25:49.066 --> 25:50.116
You all good?

25:50.314 --> 25:51.974
There are some people out there.

25:52.054 --> 25:54.887
This bored town is doing
Thanksgiving, eh?

25:55.734 --> 25:58.038
- I don't know.
- Did they follow you? Are you okay?

25:58.158 --> 26:00.410
No, I don't think they followed me.
I just...

26:00.684 --> 26:03.037
There was very weird girl
who tried to scare me.

26:03.644 --> 26:04.497
All right.

26:04.799 --> 26:07.099
We got your back in there, right?
You know that?

26:07.262 --> 26:08.829
Yeah, I know you do.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.172
I got your back.

26:10.292 --> 26:11.589
Good, looking out.

26:12.015 --> 26:14.565
- Good night, Wayne.
- Good night, dear.

26:47.856 --> 26:48.706
<i>Hello?</i>

26:48.892 --> 26:50.042
Hey, what's up?

26:50.356 --> 26:51.804
<i>Hey, are you all right?</i>

26:52.287 --> 26:52.987
Yeah.

26:53.985 --> 26:55.185
Why? I just...

26:55.929 --> 26:58.479
I do not know,
I just want to hear your voice.

26:59.274 --> 27:01.174
I had this weird thing happened.

27:01.355 --> 27:02.655
<i>What happened?</i>

27:10.530 --> 27:11.770
<i>You're there by yourself?</i>

27:11.988 --> 27:12.863
Um...

27:13.786 --> 27:15.823
Yeah, Nicole kind of left.

27:16.984 --> 27:17.884
<i>Why?</i>

27:18.798 --> 27:20.608
I don't know.
She has family issues.

27:20.956 --> 27:22.693
<i>Wait.
How come you didn't tell me?</i>

27:22.813 --> 27:25.801
I don't know.
I just didn't want to guilt trip you.

27:50.387 --> 27:53.557
<i>- Well, I come back.</i>
- No, no, Aaron. You don't have to do that.

27:53.763 --> 27:57.203
<i>- It's nothing. I'll be there in two hours.</i>
- No, don't come back. It's fine.

27:57.323 --> 28:00.613
<i>Justine, I'm gonna let you
spend the night by yourself.</i>

28:08.435 --> 28:09.636
Hey, Dave.

28:10.083 --> 28:10.810
<i>Yep.</i>

28:10.844 --> 28:13.004
Keep your eyes out on
the perimeter, would you?

28:13.387 --> 28:14.337
<i>Copy that.</i>

28:26.557 --> 28:28.967
Look, stay there and
enjoy your family.

28:29.087 --> 28:30.837
Talk when you get back.

28:32.352 --> 28:33.052
<i>Okay.</i>

28:33.538 --> 28:35.150
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

28:35.764 --> 28:37.445
Everything's fine.

28:41.249 --> 28:42.605
Everything's fine.

28:46.226 --> 28:47.292
<i>Kristy.</i>

29:40.362 --> 29:41.382
Wayne?

30:06.484 --> 30:07.534
Wayne?

31:32.430 --> 31:33.620
Hello!

33:38.883 --> 33:40.289
Cannot connect.

33:55.047 --> 33:56.021
Wayne!

33:57.424 --> 33:58.421
Wayne!

33:58.828 --> 33:59.821
Wayne!

34:20.145 --> 34:21.925
Oh, come on.
Come on.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.400
I like your room.

35:11.749 --> 35:12.935
Pretty boy.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.841
You got it all, Kristy.

36:21.226 --> 36:22.686
Hey!

36:23.166 --> 36:24.386
Hey!

36:25.388 --> 36:26.041
Hey!

36:26.112 --> 36:27.474
Wayne!
Wayne!

36:27.743 --> 36:28.543
Wayne!

36:28.663 --> 36:30.160
- Justine, get out of there!
- Wayne!

36:30.347 --> 36:31.494
Just... Just get out!

37:06.950 --> 37:08.001
Kristy!

37:08.551 --> 37:10.051
I'm not.
I'm Justine.

37:10.299 --> 37:11.461
You're Kristy.

37:19.017 --> 37:20.699
The hunt begins.

37:29.853 --> 37:31.653
Run to God, Kristy.

42:40.629 --> 42:41.514
Scott!

42:44.595 --> 42:46.071
Scott! Help!

42:47.094 --> 42:47.931
Scott.

42:49.517 --> 42:50.317
Scott!

42:51.185 --> 42:52.358
Scott! Help!

42:53.273 --> 42:54.073
Scott!

42:54.515 --> 42:56.353
- Watch her!
- Scott, I'm home!

42:56.473 --> 42:57.273
Help!

42:57.777 --> 43:00.022
Wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on a second.

43:00.332 --> 43:01.928
- Oh, my God.
- I could have died.

43:01.968 --> 43:03.135
Are you okay?

43:03.169 --> 43:04.372
- What are you talking about?
- Lock the door.

43:04.405 --> 43:06.885
- No, no, no. No.
- Lock the fucking door.

43:06.932 --> 43:07.885
Titus!

43:07.943 --> 43:10.019
- They killed them.
- What do you mean they killed them?

43:10.053 --> 43:11.805
What are you talking about?

43:13.736 --> 43:14.986
It's cut.

43:16.443 --> 43:17.943
Everything's cut.

43:18.295 --> 43:20.137
- No-one's here.
- Ok. Wait. Hold on.

43:20.178 --> 43:21.578
Hold on a second.

43:21.882 --> 43:23.058
Listen.

43:23.585 --> 43:25.505
You got to go real slow
explaining what's happening,

43:25.545 --> 43:27.612
because I'm really
fucking stoned right now.

43:27.898 --> 43:28.805
OK.

43:30.221 --> 43:32.231
There's people out there...

43:32.930 --> 43:34.037
What?

43:34.529 --> 43:36.277
There's people out there...

43:36.544 --> 43:38.187
and they killed David and Wayne.

43:38.236 --> 43:41.009
They are some kind of cult.
Do you have a cell phone?

43:41.349 --> 43:42.956
Where's your cell phone?

43:43.076 --> 43:45.625
- Where is your cell phone?
- Just relax.

43:45.752 --> 43:47.198
They are out there.

43:54.348 --> 43:55.501
Scott.

44:01.998 --> 44:03.252
The lights are on the motion sensors.

44:03.279 --> 44:05.099
They'll come on
if anyone gets in the house.

44:05.217 --> 44:06.665
Take a seat for a second.

44:06.737 --> 44:08.778
Take a seat for a second.
I'll be right back.

44:08.818 --> 44:10.428
Titus, stay here.

44:10.661 --> 44:13.021
Phone is right here somewhere.
Let me find it.

45:24.237 --> 45:25.313
Scott?

45:33.399 --> 45:34.489
I'm right here.

45:34.542 --> 45:35.908
- Where's you cell phone?
- Sh, sh.

45:35.983 --> 45:39.362
- Police will never get here in time.
- Scott, where's your phone?

45:46.651 --> 45:49.271
- They're here.
- Hey, Titus. It's okay.

45:50.025 --> 45:53.231
- How many are out there?
- Four-Four, at least.

45:57.846 --> 46:00.074
- Don't go out there.
- Stay with the dog.

46:13.442 --> 46:15.676
Now you know I have a gun!

46:15.898 --> 46:17.945
Now, get off my campus!

46:44.458 --> 46:46.605
- Titus!
- Titus! Titus, no!

46:46.825 --> 46:48.298
Titus, come here!

46:49.765 --> 46:50.708
Titus!

46:54.729 --> 46:55.641
Titus!

46:57.424 --> 47:00.654
Get off my dog,
you fucking pieces of shit!

47:05.248 --> 47:06.997
Who the fuck are you?

47:22.064 --> 47:24.066
He's had my dog.
He's got my baby.

47:24.186 --> 47:26.331
- Pieces of shit.
- We have to go.

47:26.451 --> 47:27.411
Right now.

47:27.607 --> 47:30.100
- Get the keys. They're on the table.
- Where?

47:34.633 --> 47:35.772
Where's the phone?

47:35.820 --> 47:37.626
I don't know! I don't know!
Check the desk.

47:41.427 --> 47:42.400
Oh, God.

47:42.745 --> 47:44.753
God, where's fucking this?

47:46.811 --> 47:48.261
Have to call someone.

47:48.983 --> 47:51.201
I got you, you son of a bitch.

47:57.384 --> 47:58.263
Scott?

47:59.604 --> 48:00.850
Scott!

48:37.200 --> 48:38.683
No, please help!

49:04.370 --> 49:06.166
<i>911 emergency direct.</i>

49:06.259 --> 49:08.166
<i>Did someone just try
to reach us on this line?</i>

49:08.291 --> 49:10.814
My name is Justine Wills.
I'm at Birch College.

49:10.867 --> 49:13.657
There're people try to kill me.
They killed the guards. I need help.

49:13.711 --> 49:15.611
<i>It's gonna be ok.
Where are you right now?</i>

49:15.651 --> 49:17.178
I'm on campus.

49:17.499 --> 49:19.049
In... In the library.

49:19.275 --> 49:20.561
I'll be in the library.

49:20.681 --> 49:22.691
I have the keys,
I can lock myself inside.

49:22.774 --> 49:24.230
<i>I need you to stay on the line.</i>

49:24.337 --> 49:26.450
<i>Slow down but keep your phone.</i>

49:58.103 --> 49:59.159
Hello?

49:59.848 --> 50:01.192
I'm here.
I'm inside.

50:02.792 --> 50:04.299
<i>I need you to stay on the line.</i>

50:04.395 --> 50:05.907
<i>You need to be there at all time.</i>

50:06.027 --> 50:07.424
<i>They will be right with you.</i>

50:07.544 --> 50:08.670
Thank you.

50:12.130 --> 50:13.417
Oh God, thank you.

50:13.719 --> 50:15.119
<i>You're welcome.</i>

50:17.181 --> 50:18.031
<i>Kristy.</i>

50:19.049 --> 50:22.661
<i>Kristy. Kristy. Kristy.</i>

50:22.956 --> 50:27.019
<i>Don't you realize that the maintenance
number posted all over this campus?</i>

54:17.044 --> 54:18.547
Smile, Kristy.

54:19.047 --> 54:20.940
I'm not Kristy.

54:22.058 --> 54:23.744
Why are you doing this?

54:23.864 --> 54:25.140
Pretty hair.

54:25.721 --> 54:27.031
Pretty car.

55:25.993 --> 55:28.164
<i>Kristy.</i>

55:29.340 --> 55:33.555
<i>Kristy.</i>

55:34.341 --> 55:39.547
<i>Kristy.</i>

55:53.659 --> 55:54.939
Oh, my God.

55:59.172 --> 56:00.055
Aaron.

56:00.197 --> 56:01.132
Aaron.

56:01.928 --> 56:02.851
Aaron!

56:03.551 --> 56:04.611
Aaron!

56:05.122 --> 56:06.231
Aaron!

56:14.270 --> 56:15.609
What the hell?

56:19.148 --> 56:20.851
Justine!

56:24.426 --> 56:25.777
Jus!

56:28.701 --> 56:29.697
Jus!

56:32.269 --> 56:33.497
You okay?

56:34.697 --> 56:35.771
Aaron!

56:36.271 --> 56:37.331
Aaron!

56:38.202 --> 56:39.158
Justine?

56:40.085 --> 56:41.131
Aaron!

56:42.788 --> 56:43.488
Hey!

56:43.700 --> 56:44.858
Who are you?

56:47.960 --> 56:48.847
Aaron!

56:48.987 --> 56:49.894
Aaron!

56:50.071 --> 56:51.071
Come here!

56:51.191 --> 56:53.041
Come here, we have to go.
We have to go.

56:53.161 --> 56:54.567
Come here, now!

56:54.680 --> 56:56.040
We have to go.

56:56.185 --> 56:58.481
- Come on.
- Justine, what the hell's going on?

56:58.528 --> 56:59.515
We don't have time to...

56:59.575 --> 57:01.183
Are you okay?
What the hell...

57:02.668 --> 57:03.668
No!

57:04.342 --> 57:05.589
No!

57:05.988 --> 57:07.191
No!

57:07.472 --> 57:08.645
No!

57:23.353 --> 57:25.156
No!

58:01.213 --> 58:02.433
Fuck you!

58:06.312 --> 58:08.556
Fucking die, you piece of shit!

58:28.924 --> 58:29.998
Come on.

59:55.171 --> 59:56.434
<i>Aaron, come on.</i>

59:57.567 --> 59:58.611
<i> I love you.</i>

01:00:00.634 --> 01:00:02.024
<i>I love you, Justine.</i>

01:00:50.422 --> 01:00:52.032
You can do this.

01:13:06.999 --> 01:13:09.339
<i>Kill Kristy.</i>

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:12.039
<i>Kristy is pretty,</i>

01:13:12.175 --> 01:13:13.213
<i>pure,</i>

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.680
<i>blessed.</i>

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:48.204
No God,

01:13:48.711 --> 01:13:49.844
no law...

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:52.118
can protect them.

01:14:34.529 --> 01:14:37.678
<i>Kristy!</i>

01:14:41.563 --> 01:14:43.956
<i>Kristy!
Kristy!</i>

01:15:35.081 --> 01:15:36.831
I wouldn't do that.

01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:41.588
What is this?

01:15:44.175 --> 01:15:45.971
Unforeseen outcome.

01:15:47.419 --> 01:15:48.769
All dead.

01:15:50.911 --> 01:15:52.195
You have nothing.

01:17:24.952 --> 01:17:26.708
<i>Sure was one of many.</i>

01:17:28.793 --> 01:17:30.366
<i>But there are more out there.</i>

01:17:41.095 --> 01:17:45.705
<i>Information from the lone survivor of
the previous attack on the college campus,</i>

01:17:45.851 --> 01:17:48.441
<i>has lead authorities to Colorado,
arrested three young men</i>

01:17:48.474 --> 01:17:50.774
<i>and looking for the fourth

<i>Now coming in from Portland, Oregon,</i>

01:17:53.124 --> 01:17:55.517

<i>practicing of a series of ritual killings</i>

01:17:58.124 --> 01:18:00.934
<i>Netcode apparently had multiple cells</i>
