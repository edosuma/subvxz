00:55.657 --> 00:57.366
Hit it outta the park, Kong!

[grunting]

00:58.785 --> 01:00.453
[gulping]

01:03.081 --> 01:05.458
[sighs] You're not supposed to eat
the pinecones.

01:05.541 --> 01:08.211
You're supposed to bat them away
with your new armbands.

01:08.294 --> 01:09.754
[chuckles] Good luck with that.

01:09.838 --> 01:11.715
This time of year,
they're filled with pine nuts.

01:11.798 --> 01:13.091
Kong loves 'em.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.508
[grunting]

01:17.470 --> 01:18.722
Yeah, but he's supposed
to be learning

01:18.805 --> 01:21.766
how to defend himself
against incoming blasts.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.559
Got that, big guy?

01:23.642 --> 01:24.894
[sighs]

01:25.937 --> 01:27.021
[grunting]

01:27.105 --> 01:28.732
Okay, here it goes!

01:35.071 --> 01:36.155
[laughing]

01:36.239 --> 01:38.366
Looks like he's figured out
how to do both.

01:38.449 --> 01:41.119
[sighs] I think we need
to keep practicing.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.162
Maybe with something less tasty.

01:43.246 --> 01:45.373
Oh, that reminds me!
Have you seen Anita?

01:45.456 --> 01:48.251
She said she was gonna make us
our favorite banana treats.

01:48.334 --> 01:51.587
Guess that's why she needed to go
into the city for more supplies.

01:57.593 --> 02:00.596
- [phone beeping]
- [grunting]

02:00.679 --> 02:03.224
Oh! <i>Mi querida</i> grandniece!

02:03.307 --> 02:07.520
Hi, Francisca! It's been so long!
<i>Qué pasa?</i>

02:07.603 --> 02:09.312
[Panchi] I've been thinking...

02:09.396 --> 02:12.233
you know that I've been living
with <i>tia</i> Maria since I was little.

02:12.316 --> 02:14.944
[Anita] <i>Of course.
That woman is an angel.</i>

02:15.028 --> 02:16.738
<i>How is dear Maria?</i>

02:16.821 --> 02:18.322
She's good!

02:18.406 --> 02:22.618
But, you know, I've always dreamed
of working to save nature.

02:22.701 --> 02:26.122
I wanna be like Lukas,
rescuing endangered animals!

02:26.205 --> 02:27.415
<i>Okay, but...</i>

02:27.498 --> 02:29.083
[gasping] Look!

02:29.167 --> 02:30.418
Are you seeing this?

02:30.501 --> 02:32.586
[Richard] I am indeed.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.588
My brother may have impressive firewalls,

02:34.672 --> 02:39.468
but away from his home base,
Anita's signal's coming in crystal clear.

02:39.552 --> 02:43.848
Yes, eavesdropping on the elderly
is the pinnacle of villainy.

02:43.932 --> 02:47.018
You think I enjoy hearing
this insipid babble?

02:47.101 --> 02:48.812
I'll do anything to find a clue

02:48.895 --> 02:51.605
to where Lukas is hiding
that hideous ape.

02:51.689 --> 02:53.357
Anything.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.194
[Anita stammers] Sí, <i>very pretty bird.</i>

02:56.277 --> 02:59.488
[stammers] <i>But now, what does</i>
tia <i>Maria say about this?</i>

02:59.572 --> 03:00.698
She wants me to tell you...

03:00.781 --> 03:01.991
[gasps]

03:07.371 --> 03:09.498
[screaming]

03:09.582 --> 03:11.960
[yelling] Francisca! Francisca!

03:12.043 --> 03:15.629
Now, this is a fortuitous turn of events.

03:15.713 --> 03:18.925
By my calculations,
that young girl would not agree.

03:19.008 --> 03:21.886
That's because Anita's grandniece
has no idea

03:21.970 --> 03:26.349
what an incredibly rare giant anaconda
is worth on the black market.

03:26.432 --> 03:30.394
Or better yet,
what an incredible bionobot it could make!

03:30.478 --> 03:33.022
I must get ahold of that snake!

03:33.106 --> 03:36.860
Please, Lukas,
if anything happens to Francisca,

03:36.943 --> 03:38.987
to my <i>querida</i> Panchi,

03:39.070 --> 03:40.696
- I will never forget...
- Easy.

03:40.779 --> 03:42.281
Try to relax, Anita.

03:42.365 --> 03:44.158
Jonesy and I are going to find out
what happened

03:44.242 --> 03:45.910
and make sure Panchi's okay.

03:46.410 --> 03:49.247
These bizcochos are for when you find her.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.166
They're Francisca's favorite,
and she will probably be...

03:52.250 --> 03:54.752
[sobbing] hungry!

03:55.419 --> 03:58.214
Batteries are fully charged.
Let's grab some sky!

03:58.297 --> 04:00.799
We are totally on board with the idea.

04:00.884 --> 04:02.218
Uh, forget it, Danny.

04:02.301 --> 04:04.762
You two definitely
have to stay home this time.

04:04.846 --> 04:06.680
[whines]

04:08.391 --> 04:10.935
Sorry, bro, but we don't have
any way to get you there.

04:11.019 --> 04:14.480
And besides, you're a fugitive,
so you're supposed to be in hiding.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.315
[grunting]

04:17.733 --> 04:19.567
[chuckles lightly]

04:19.817 --> 04:23.281
That's the ticket, big guy!
Keep hiding, and we'll be back in no time.

04:32.831 --> 04:33.832
[grunting]

04:33.917 --> 04:35.793
Oh yeah, bud.
That's enough hiding.

04:36.585 --> 04:38.212
[grunts]

04:39.547 --> 04:42.133
Let's do it!
Just like we planned!

04:44.760 --> 04:46.429
Keep up with 'em, Kong!

04:50.141 --> 04:51.267
Whoa!

04:51.350 --> 04:53.061
[alarm blaring]

04:53.144 --> 04:54.187
What is it?

04:54.270 --> 04:56.564
I don't know, but we're going down fast!
Hang on!

04:58.524 --> 05:00.443
[both groaning]

05:03.112 --> 05:04.322
[sighs]

05:05.907 --> 05:07.951
Okay, this can't be happening.

05:09.868 --> 05:10.869
[both gasp]

05:10.954 --> 05:12.371
Hey! Lemme in!

05:15.291 --> 05:17.168
Kong didn't want to be left behind,

05:17.251 --> 05:19.712
and you know how Kong gets
when he makes up his mind.

05:19.795 --> 05:23.466
Besides, you'll need Kong's muscle
when you come up against that giant snake.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.259
[grunting happily]

05:25.343 --> 05:27.595
No! It could be dangerous!

05:27.678 --> 05:30.348
Anyway, how's Kong gonna fit
inside this helicopter?

05:30.431 --> 05:34.477
Come on! You said you use this copter
to airlift elephants to safety,

05:34.560 --> 05:36.062
so why not give Kong a lift?

05:36.145 --> 05:39.898
Let's see... because he's heavier
than ten elephants?

05:39.983 --> 05:42.526
Jonesy can do it.
He's a techno-wizard.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.196
[chuckles] Smooth schmoozing, kid.

05:45.279 --> 05:47.198
Amping up the power's the easy part.

05:47.281 --> 05:48.907
The flying ape part's a little trickier,

05:48.992 --> 05:51.577
but I think I've got something
we can use back at camp.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.537
Okay, let's make it fast!

05:58.251 --> 06:00.628
[ratcheting]

06:00.711 --> 06:02.713
This baby's on nice and tight.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.882
I've loaded a backup battery, too.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.636
All right, let's get going.

06:16.144 --> 06:19.147
Okay, Kong!
Get ready, like we showed you!

06:19.230 --> 06:21.107
[grunting]

06:21.190 --> 06:23.192
[Lukas] This might tickle a little, bro.

06:24.193 --> 06:25.694
[laughing]

06:31.784 --> 06:33.494
[Danny] We have ape-nition.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.208
[grunting]

06:59.145 --> 07:01.522
[Jonesy] Usumacinta River's just up ahead.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.068
Sure a lot of bald patches in the forest.

07:05.151 --> 07:06.777
The scars of clearcutting.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.156
The deforestation's probably what brought
the anaconda this far north.

07:10.239 --> 07:13.701
With their habitat shrinking,
like the rest of the world's wildlife,

07:13.784 --> 07:16.412
the anaconda has to adapt or perish.

07:17.038 --> 07:18.164
That's not fair.

07:18.247 --> 07:21.250
Nope, but it's why we do
what we do, Danny.

07:21.959 --> 07:23.461
Rescue gear's ready.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.003
Hey, this is new.

07:25.088 --> 07:28.132
[chuckles] Yeah,
little surprise I worked up.

07:28.216 --> 07:31.052
Okay.
Triangulating on Panchi's holo-phone.

07:31.135 --> 07:32.886
Signal says we're right on top of her.

07:34.972 --> 07:36.349
Look! It's the snake!

07:36.432 --> 07:39.768
Man-o-man-aconda, it's a monster!

07:39.852 --> 07:43.606
Okay, we've found the snake,
but there's no sign of Panchi.

07:43.689 --> 07:45.274
You don't think she's...

07:45.358 --> 07:47.818
inside the anaconda, do you?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.528
[pterodactyl screeching]

07:49.612 --> 07:50.696
We've got company.

07:54.950 --> 07:57.370
[Jonesy] Richard's hot-bot
must be after the anaconda.

07:57.453 --> 07:59.122
[Lukas] But how did Richard
know about it?

08:00.748 --> 08:02.125
[roaring]

08:05.961 --> 08:08.797
[roaring]

08:12.635 --> 08:13.886
[Danny] Not fair!

08:13.969 --> 08:16.680
Kong can't land a punch
stuck on this helicopter!

08:16.764 --> 08:19.183
Let's see if I can maneuver him
into punching position!

08:29.067 --> 08:31.237
Whoa! [gasps]

08:33.239 --> 08:34.782
[pterodactyl screeching]

08:43.207 --> 08:44.500
[roars]

08:44.583 --> 08:48.296
[Lukas] Ha! Just like the run-and-shoot
offense we played in college!

08:49.380 --> 08:50.673
[grunting]

08:52.175 --> 08:53.426
[grunts]

08:54.510 --> 08:57.763
Yo, Lukas! This would be a good time
to try out my surprise!

08:57.846 --> 08:59.890
[roaring]

09:08.023 --> 09:09.942
Laser net.
Pretty cool, right?

09:10.025 --> 09:11.610
Awesome tech, Jonesy!

09:11.694 --> 09:13.821
I do love your surprises.

09:14.697 --> 09:16.073
Well, here's one you won't.

09:16.157 --> 09:17.700
We're running out of juice.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.915
[Lukas] You better finish this fast, bro,
before we lose it!

09:24.998 --> 09:26.292
[grunting]

09:30.629 --> 09:33.757
Okay, not what I meant, but...
sure, that works, too.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.343
[Kong grunting]

09:37.010 --> 09:38.221
[faint screech]

09:39.222 --> 09:41.515
[roaring]

09:49.607 --> 09:50.941
[roars]

09:59.575 --> 10:03.078
Let's see how your primitive monkey-mind
deals with this.

10:05.914 --> 10:06.915
[Botila grunts]

10:07.458 --> 10:10.253
Apparently, far better than I calculated.

10:12.087 --> 10:13.589
[roaring]

10:14.882 --> 10:17.175
[imitating Kong's roar]

10:17.260 --> 10:20.804
[laughs] All right!
The Kong-a-nator scores!

10:31.064 --> 10:33.734
[shouting] Panchi! Panchi!

10:33.817 --> 10:35.486
[device crackling]

10:41.450 --> 10:42.910
Guys...

10:42.993 --> 10:46.163
her holo-phone signal
is coming from inside the anaconda.

10:47.956 --> 10:49.124
[hissing]

10:49.207 --> 10:50.334
Oh, no!

10:50.418 --> 10:51.710
[grunting]

10:51.794 --> 10:54.212
[Panchi speaking Spanish]

10:55.923 --> 10:57.966
She doesn't want you
to hurt the snake.

10:58.050 --> 10:59.927
[chuckles] Ah, Panchi!

11:00.010 --> 11:01.554
[speaking Spanish]

11:01.637 --> 11:03.722
[laughs] <i>Hola,</i> Lukas!

11:03.806 --> 11:06.975
[speaking Spanish]

11:07.059 --> 11:08.769
[grunts] She's cute.

11:08.852 --> 11:10.646
Too bad she doesn't speak English.

11:10.729 --> 11:12.440
Too bad you don't speak Spanish.

11:12.523 --> 11:15.609
Huh? Uh, yeah,
but I can speak Chinese!

11:15.693 --> 11:16.944
[speaking Mandarin]

11:17.027 --> 11:18.862
Okay, so do you.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.573
But I can talk to the animals!

11:20.656 --> 11:22.533
That's awesome, Dr. Dolittle.

11:22.616 --> 11:25.285
[chuckles] I just wanted
to talk to <i>mi tia abuela,</i>

11:25.369 --> 11:27.413
but the snake ate my phone.

11:27.496 --> 11:29.957
Anita, I've got some great news.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.167
Francisca, is she all right?

11:32.250 --> 11:35.629
Uh... so, is your name
Panchi or Francisca?

11:35.713 --> 11:37.798
Both.
Panchi is my nickname.

11:37.881 --> 11:40.884
Hola, tia <i>Anita!
Thanks for sending Lukas!</i>

11:40.968 --> 11:44.304
Francisca!
Oh, thank heavens!

11:44.388 --> 11:46.474
[Chatter] Bawk!
Happy dance!

11:46.557 --> 11:49.643
Oh, you beautiful child!
I was so worried!

11:51.269 --> 11:54.064
<i>What were you thinking?
You could have been eaten!</i>

11:54.147 --> 11:57.443
<i>I need to have a word with</i> tia <i>Maria
about keeping a better eye on you!</i>

11:57.526 --> 11:59.277
That's what I was starting to tell you.

11:59.362 --> 12:03.156
We've been talking it over,
and <i>tia</i> Maria agrees it's time for me

12:03.240 --> 12:05.409
- to come and live with you.
- Qué?

12:05.493 --> 12:08.621
<i>You know it's my dream
to work with Lukas saving animals.</i>

12:08.704 --> 12:09.747
<i>Sí,</i> but...

12:09.830 --> 12:12.958
Tia <i>Anita, you always promised
when I was old enough,</i>

12:13.041 --> 12:15.085
<i>I could come to the US and be with you.</i>

12:15.168 --> 12:16.545
<i>I am ready!</i>

12:16.629 --> 12:17.796
<i>She has my vote.</i>

12:17.880 --> 12:21.091
<i>I think Panchi would make a great addition
to the team.</i>

12:22.134 --> 12:24.052
Please...

12:25.095 --> 12:28.807
Oh, come and be with me,
my little spider monkey!

12:28.891 --> 12:31.769
I have missed you so much!

12:31.852 --> 12:33.646
<i>I will see you soon, Francisca!</i>

12:34.855 --> 12:37.566
- <i>Keep her safe, Lukas.</i>
- Promise.

12:41.319 --> 12:42.655
[speaking Spanish]

12:42.738 --> 12:43.781
[roaring]

12:43.864 --> 12:47.159
Step away from the snake
and no one gets hurt!

12:47.242 --> 12:48.869
[roaring]

12:50.078 --> 12:51.455
[roaring]

12:52.372 --> 12:53.541
Whoa!

13:03.091 --> 13:04.427
[Kong grunting]

13:08.221 --> 13:09.306
[grunting]

13:18.023 --> 13:19.107
[Kong groans]

13:19.191 --> 13:20.943
[grunting]

13:24.780 --> 13:27.032
[grunting]

13:27.115 --> 13:29.367
Those dinosaurs are going to crush Kong!

13:29.452 --> 13:31.328
Wow, I can't believe I just said that.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.706
Isn't there something
we can do to help him?

13:33.789 --> 13:36.083
I know how you feel,
but give him a minute.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.043
The big guy usually works it out.

13:38.126 --> 13:39.753
[grunting]

13:47.260 --> 13:48.721
[Brag groans]

13:55.102 --> 13:56.353
[roaring]

13:57.312 --> 14:00.983
[Wheeler chuckling] Yeah!
You and your stinkin' ape are gonna fry!

14:08.699 --> 14:10.576
We've got to put out this fire!

14:32.389 --> 14:33.807
[roaring]

14:33.891 --> 14:36.226
[both] Kong, turn on the waterworks!

14:36.309 --> 14:38.979
Ha! Should've known
you invented the game with him.

14:40.773 --> 14:42.775
[both] Now, blow, bro!

14:48.155 --> 14:50.323
[Danny] You did it, Kong!
[Lukas] Good job!

14:50.407 --> 14:54.119
Pleasure doing business with ya...
losers!

14:54.202 --> 14:56.789
[laughs] Whoa!

14:56.872 --> 14:59.291
[Danny] They got the anaconda!

14:59.374 --> 15:02.002
[roaring]

15:06.423 --> 15:08.258
[laughing]

15:09.051 --> 15:10.803
Okay, team, let's get out of here

15:10.886 --> 15:13.556
and start figuring out
how we're gonna save that snake...

15:14.139 --> 15:16.850
before my brother sells it
on the black market...

15:16.934 --> 15:18.769
or worse!

15:18.852 --> 15:20.938
[Panchi] Your helicopter needs a tune-up.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.523
[Danny] Did you just diss our ride?

15:22.606 --> 15:26.860
[Jonesy] Afraid it's gonna be slow going
until the backup battery recharges.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.239
[Richard] The bionics I inserted
into the anaconda

15:31.323 --> 15:33.033
are responding perfectly.

15:33.116 --> 15:35.911
I'd say the procedure went
extremely well.

15:35.994 --> 15:37.913
Of course. I was assisting.

15:37.996 --> 15:41.291
I now have complete control
over the anaconda.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.919
So now we can put on
the finishing touches.

15:44.628 --> 15:47.297
My new super-forged titanium armor

15:47.380 --> 15:50.926
will make this next generation
bionobot unbeatable.

15:51.009 --> 15:52.469
You hope.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.681
How about I test it out on...

15:55.764 --> 15:57.850
you!

15:57.933 --> 15:59.142
Not amusing.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.729
On the contrary. [laughs]

16:02.395 --> 16:03.647
But enough fun.

16:03.731 --> 16:06.692
Any minute now,
my righteous brother and his ape

16:06.775 --> 16:08.944
will attempt to rescue the anaconda.

16:09.027 --> 16:11.196
- [rumbling]
- Speak of the...

16:11.279 --> 16:12.740
[alarm blaring]

16:12.823 --> 16:16.284
Confirmed.
Kong and company are on the island.

16:16.368 --> 16:19.788
Time to have my snake wrap things up.

16:20.831 --> 16:22.415
[roaring]

16:22.499 --> 16:23.917
[hissing]

16:31.091 --> 16:33.176
[groaning]

16:37.973 --> 16:39.642
[grunts] You two stay put!

16:40.308 --> 16:41.977
[groaning]

16:42.060 --> 16:44.271
What has Richard done
to that poor creature?

16:44.354 --> 16:46.690
Whatever it is,
it wasn't part of the plan.

16:46.774 --> 16:48.025
[grunting]

16:49.234 --> 16:50.819
Sic it to him, Kong!

16:50.903 --> 16:54.197
You seem amazingly calm,
like this happens all the time.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.532
[scoffs] Pretty much.

16:55.616 --> 16:57.575
Whoa! <i>Loco.</i>

16:59.119 --> 17:02.455
What could be better
than remote-controlled revenge?

17:02.539 --> 17:04.124
[grunting]

17:05.041 --> 17:06.167
[groaning]

17:11.298 --> 17:12.883
[Lukas] Kong's trying
not to hurt the snake,

17:12.965 --> 17:14.384
but he can't take much more.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.636
Nail him with the laser net!

17:15.719 --> 17:18.512
But I can't net the anaconda
without getting Kong!

17:19.682 --> 17:20.973
[both grunt]

17:22.392 --> 17:24.227
Botila, get the dinosaurs

17:24.310 --> 17:26.229
to take care of my brother
and his companions

17:26.313 --> 17:28.356
while I enjoy my victory.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.192
Yes, master.

17:31.694 --> 17:33.111
Incoming!

17:34.362 --> 17:35.613
On it!

17:40.869 --> 17:42.329
[Jonesy] Gotcha!

17:44.164 --> 17:45.165
[Jonesy grunts]

17:45.248 --> 17:48.126
Hmm. I have five times your strength.

17:48.210 --> 17:50.754
Could it be you enjoy
the beatings I administer?

17:50.838 --> 17:53.048
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:54.091 --> 17:56.259
Care to go another round?

17:56.343 --> 17:57.469
Why not?

17:58.011 --> 18:00.138
- Not... Not... Not...
- [electricity crackling]

18:01.598 --> 18:03.809
Hope you don't mind
my saving you from yourself.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.770
[groaning]

18:11.649 --> 18:15.237
Your prize monkey's
about to go down, Lukas.

18:15.320 --> 18:20.242
<i>Even with his grotesquely large mouth,
he's bitten off more than he can chew.</i>

18:20.325 --> 18:22.369
"More than he can chew..."

18:22.452 --> 18:24.830
That snake's really zapping Kong!

18:24.913 --> 18:26.664
Too bad he can't zap her back.

18:26.749 --> 18:28.458
[exclaims] That's it!

18:29.042 --> 18:31.169
Help me with Jonesy's backup battery.

18:31.253 --> 18:33.213
[Danny grunting]

18:33.296 --> 18:35.382
Wow, this thing weighs a ton!

18:36.341 --> 18:38.385
[Panchi] Lift with your knees!

18:40.470 --> 18:42.723
Jonesy, we're gonna try
to get the snake to eat this.

18:42.806 --> 18:43.849
Genius!

18:43.932 --> 18:45.308
[groaning]

18:47.394 --> 18:48.686
She'll be okay, right?

18:48.771 --> 18:51.774
There's just enough volts to give her
a good jolt so we can net her.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.652
- [grunting]
- Kong, feed her this!

18:56.779 --> 18:59.865
Like this, Kong.
See?

19:06.288 --> 19:08.791
What? No!
Don't eat that!

19:12.627 --> 19:13.796
[electricity crackling]

19:13.879 --> 19:15.463
[screaming] No!

19:21.929 --> 19:23.513
[sighs]

19:26.975 --> 19:28.936
Great work, kids.

19:30.312 --> 19:33.690
[Jonesy] Yeah, but how am I gonna get
the chopper in the air without a battery?

19:33.774 --> 19:37.027
[laughs] I'm just playing with y'all!
I got a backup.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.988
This is one heavy snake.
We'd better lighten the load.

19:40.072 --> 19:42.324
Danny, take Panchi
and head home with Kong.

19:42.407 --> 19:44.868
Jonesy and I will net the snake
and meet you there.

19:46.411 --> 19:47.662
[Danny] You cool, Panchi?

19:47.745 --> 19:50.540
- You're not scared, are you?
- [Panchi laughs] No way!

19:50.623 --> 19:53.418
I'm just sorry it took me so long
to join the team!

19:54.502 --> 19:56.421
Oh, <i>mi querida!</i>

19:56.504 --> 19:58.048
Oh, my darling child!

19:58.131 --> 20:00.926
Oh! I am never letting you go!

20:01.009 --> 20:05.513
[straining] <i>Gracias, tia,</i>
but you hug tighter than the anaconda.

20:08.183 --> 20:10.102
There. That's the last of it.

20:10.185 --> 20:11.769
We can reverse-engineer this tech

20:11.854 --> 20:15.190
and maybe get some insight
into your brother's scientific methods.

20:15.273 --> 20:18.401
I'm afraid Richard's seriously starting
to lose it.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.113
He certainly has lost sight
of his humanity

20:21.196 --> 20:24.032
to do such a thing
to this beautiful creature.

20:24.116 --> 20:26.201
Chopper's fully recharged
and ready to go.

20:26.284 --> 20:28.495
Okay, then let's get this girl
back to Mexico

20:28.578 --> 20:30.831
before the anesthesia
wears off completely.

20:30.914 --> 20:34.251
We'll have to relocate her somewhere
Richard and his hench-bots won't find her.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.254
By the way,
I managed to retrieve your phone.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.215
A little worse for wear,
but it's still working.

20:40.298 --> 20:41.383
Thanks, Amy, and...

20:41.466 --> 20:43.468
Aw, gross!

20:43.551 --> 20:45.888
[laughs] That's nothing.

20:46.930 --> 20:49.057
- Right, Kong?
- [laughing]

20:51.059 --> 20:52.727
Snot alert! Take cover!

20:52.810 --> 20:54.646
[all clamoring]

20:54.729 --> 20:57.649
[laughing] Welcome to Kong's world!

20:57.732 --> 20:59.192
[laughing]

21:02.570 --> 21:03.780
You rang?

21:03.864 --> 21:08.368
Lukas succeeded tonight,
but that trick will never work again.

21:08.451 --> 21:11.329
From now on,
I'm shielding all my bionic power sources

21:11.413 --> 21:13.456
[muffled] from that sort of overload.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.001
Starting with you, Botila.

21:16.084 --> 21:17.460
