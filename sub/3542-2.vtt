00:03.480 --> 00:06.643
Does Elena enjoy having
both of you worship at her altar?

00:06.800 --> 00:10.964
Crazy, impulsive
vampire in love with his brother's girl.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.281
Where's Stefan?

00:12.440 --> 00:14.124
He gave himself over to Klaus.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.130
Klaus is born of a werewolf bloodline.
A curse has kept...

00:17.280 --> 00:18.884
his werewolf aspect from manifesting.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.128
If he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.763
I want to create more of me. You being
the first werewolf I've come across...

00:25.960 --> 00:28.201
I need you to direct me to your pack.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.648
You know I died, right? Bonnie used
magic to bring me back to life?

00:31.840 --> 00:35.526
Ever since I came back, I've been seeing
things I shouldn't be seeing.

00:35.720 --> 00:36.881
Vicki?

00:37.040 --> 00:39.327
Did you say "Vicki,"
as in my sister, Vicki?

00:39.480 --> 00:42.802
Bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire,
so don't be his friend.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.440
Promise me no one
will find out about us.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.443
- Mrs. Lockwood.
- Leaving so soon?

00:48.200 --> 00:51.044
Why didn't you tell me you've been
tracking Klaus' victims?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.487
They're not Klaus' victims,
they're Stefan's.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.846
- What?
- He's flipped.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.923
Stefan is gone, he's not coming back.

00:58.840 --> 01:04.370
Hello? Stefan? Stefan, if this is you,
you'll be okay.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.440
<i>Whether a suicide or a tragic accident...</i>

01:08.600 --> 01:12.207
<i>WPK W News has lost
one of its shining stars.</i>

01:12.360 --> 01:15.330
<i>Field reporter and weekend anchor,
Andie Star...</i>

01:15.480 --> 01:17.847
Just can't stay away, can you?

01:20.240 --> 01:21.685
You've been dodging my calls.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.046
Yeah, busy day, you know?

01:23.200 --> 01:25.567
Dead fake girlfriend and all.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.280
Why didn't you tell me?

01:27.480 --> 01:30.689
Happy Birthday, Elena,
Stefan killed Andie. Cake?

01:30.840 --> 01:31.921
He called me, Damon.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.046
What?

01:35.760 --> 01:38.081
Stefan called me last night.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.646
What did he say?

01:41.360 --> 01:44.091
He didn't say anything.
But it was him.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.244
I asked Sheriff Forbes
if she would trace the call's origin.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.811
It came from Tennessee.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.162
Where he's binge-drinking
on the country folk.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.650
We went through this, Elena.
Stefan's gone.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.168
And I don't mean geographically.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.764
If he was gone,
he wouldn't have called.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.362
Go away, Damon.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.964
All right.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.726
Hi.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.444
Ahem, you're not who I expected.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.763
I need you to tell me what you know
about Stefan and Tennessee.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.490
Did you miss the part
where I checked out of all this?

02:45.680 --> 02:47.444
Come on, Ric.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.529
Whatever Damon knows, you know.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.920
Ask Damon.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.243
Yeah, but Damon's not exactly
in the mood to help right now.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.851
For good reason.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.570
Because it's not safe for you.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.570
- Stefan's off the rails.
- He's holding on to his humanity.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.449
Which means he can still be saved.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.241
- Why do you have to save him?
- I'm not the kind of person who checks out.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.160
Look, he would never give up on me.
I'm not gonna give up on him.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.563
Tell me what you know, Ric.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.680
Please.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.849
They've been tracking werewolves,
he and Klaus.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.411
All up the eastern seaboard.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.126
We thought we had them
outside of Memphis.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.487
Are you okay? ls Ray getting heavy?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.085
I'm fine.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.520
You sure about that?

03:41.680 --> 03:44.286
We've been walking
for quite some time now.

03:44.480 --> 03:48.166
Do you need some water
or a little sit-down?

03:48.320 --> 03:51.290
You know, I get that
we're stuck together...

03:52.200 --> 03:55.886
but if we could maybe just skip
the chitchat, it'd be great.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.168
So much brooding.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.971
Your self-loathing is suffocating you,
my friend.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.010
Maybe it's because I'm a little tired
of hunting werewolves.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.571
We've been at it all summer.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.650
Thanks to our pal, Ray,
we've found ourselves a pack.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.801
Ray. Oh, my God.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.609
What's going on?

04:36.400 --> 04:37.526
Who are you?

04:37.680 --> 04:40.524
The important question is, who am I?

04:40.680 --> 04:43.570
Please forgive the intrusion.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.040
My name is Klaus.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.570
You're the hybrid.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.564
You've heard of me. Fantastic.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.847
- Hey, Mom.
- Morning, sweetheart. Coffee's hot.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.846
Rough night?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.243
Uh, rough week.
I'm a little stressed. You?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.409
Feeling pretty good.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.604
You know, if you're going to bring
a girl home...

05:47.760 --> 05:50.081
I wish she'd not sneak out
like a prostitute.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.770
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hm.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.010
She snuck out?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.766
Hmm.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.811
Whoa.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.726
Think the cream's bad.

06:11.880 --> 06:12.961
Don't wait up tonight.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.010
Oh, and Caroline, she's not a prostitute.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.086
Bill? It's Carol Lockwood.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.086
I've gotten myself
into a bit of a vampire situation.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.407
You're not one of these losers
that hangs out at work on his day off?

06:50.560 --> 06:53.689
Remember what we talked about?
How I've been seeing things?

06:54.280 --> 06:58.604
Honestly, Jer, last night
is kind of a blur.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.764
Well, I saw her again. I saw Vicki.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.883
Why are you telling me this?

07:06.040 --> 07:07.690
You're dating a witch. Tell her.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.764
Tell Bonnie
I'm seeing by my dead girlfriend?

07:11.920 --> 07:14.287
We don't need a witch.
There's examples all over.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.681
We need personal items.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.525
Works best when a family member
tries to make contact.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.603
No, no, no.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.247
We're not contacting my sister.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.887
She said, "Help me."

07:39.280 --> 07:40.884
If you're messing with me, man...

07:41.760 --> 07:43.091
I saw her, Matt.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.400
She asked for help.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.888
Look, you were the one
she loved the most.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.648
If anyone's gonna be able to help me
connect to her, it's you.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.289
A lot of us like to keep to ourselves
for the full moon.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.641
Chain ourselves up.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.928
But there are some werewolves
that like to gather...

08:13.080 --> 08:15.242
in places
where they don't have to do that.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.324
- Where they can enjoy it.
- What kind of places?

08:18.480 --> 08:21.643
Mountains, state parks, deserts,
that kind of stuff.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.091
Anywhere in Tennessee?

08:24.240 --> 08:27.961
Yeah. Here, give me your phone,
I'll try to pull up a map.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.841
Thanks for this.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.885
I know it's asking a lot.

08:34.039 --> 08:38.250
As Caroline likes to remind me, Stefan's
in this mess because I bit Damon.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.166
I figure I owe you one.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.610
Have you talked to her today?

08:45.160 --> 08:46.685
No, why?

08:47.680 --> 08:49.682
Just curious.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.481
Here.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.450
That's your best bet.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.321
You get anything?

09:02.520 --> 09:05.410
How do you feel about a hike
through the Smoky Mountains?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.410
You wanna hunt down
a pack of werewolves on a full moon?

09:09.640 --> 09:11.210
We'll be out of there
before the moon's full.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.891
If you don't come with me,
I'm going by myself.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.408
What? You're the one who told me
I could handle things on my own now.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.961
Yeah, I meant, like, frozen dinners
and SAT's.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.490
All right, fine. Let's just go.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.930
But you're driving.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.890
It's fascinating, actually.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.722
A werewolf who isn't beholden
to the moon.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.008
A vampire who doesn't burn in the sun.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.646
A true hybrid.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.930
Excellent timing, Ray.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.762
- Very dramatic.
- What's happening to me?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.126
Stefan?

09:55.360 --> 09:56.771
Are any of you human?

09:58.440 --> 10:03.446
Your friend here needs human blood
to complete his transition to vampire.

10:05.160 --> 10:09.210
- If he doesn't get it, he will die.
- Doesn't take much.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.010
Just a sip.

10:13.320 --> 10:18.611
Anyone? A boyfriend, a girlfriend
along for the ride.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.326
You.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.566
No!

10:29.800 --> 10:32.087
You don't drink it, Ray, I will.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.321
Problem is, I don't know how to stop.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.484
It's the new order, sweetheart.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.604
You join us or you die.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.967
I'd rather die than be a vampire.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.286
Wrong choice.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.245
She'll thank me for that later. Heh.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.401
Okay, who's next?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.729
You moving in? Been here forever.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.326
I was meeting Caroline.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.561
You haven't seen her, have you?

11:30.720 --> 11:34.122
Not keeping up
on her comings and goings anymore.

11:35.320 --> 11:40.167
Look, man, I never meant for me and her
being friends to be a problem for you.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.082
It is what it is.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.886
Tonight's a full moon.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.370
She usually helps you.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.891
Yeah.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.769
Whatever.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.004
Do you. uh...?

12:00.960 --> 12:03.770
Is this the kind of thing
you need another person for'?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.405
I can handle it.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.324
But thanks.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.323
What is up with my taste buds today?

12:14.480 --> 12:16.448
Heh. It's the vervain.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.082
The sheriff has me slip it into the coffee
here every now and then.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.810
That's what vervain tastes like?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.368
I'm surprised you can taste it.
The coffee usually hides the flavor.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.330
For humans, anyway.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.561
Thank you so much for coming.
Does anyone else know you're here?

12:37.720 --> 12:40.690
No, I didn't drive through town,
I came straight here.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.002
Can I offer you a drink?

12:43.600 --> 12:47.047
I think you should tell me
what you expect me to do.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.882
I was hoping you could tell me.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.411
It's Caroline, Bill.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.082
I remember the day she was born.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.891
- What does the Council know?
- I haven't said a word.

12:59.040 --> 13:03.045
I've been putting this together
on my own. For months now.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.443
Any ideas how to handle this?

13:06.320 --> 13:10.405
I can't get my hands dirty here
for a lot of reasons.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.488
She's a vampire, Carol.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.686
We do what we have to do.

13:21.600 --> 13:28.210
In a couple hours, the full moon's gonna
rise just above that ridge.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.362
That's where the pack will be.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.330
- You were a Boy Scout, weren't you?
- Shut up.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.562
A Boy Scout-slash-vampire slayer.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.327
Slash-whiskey-drinking
all around lost cause.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.324
Wow, you came stocked.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.371
Well, we aren't exactly bird-watching.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.886
Here.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.204
- Put that in your bag.
- Vervain grenade?

13:58.360 --> 13:59.771
Wolfsbane.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.601
Well, since we're exchanging gifts.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.285
That's John Gilbert's ring.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.400
It was yours once. Go ahead.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.924
It'll protect you from whatever danger
we're about to get ourselves into.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.650
He gave it to you.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.087
I'm a doppelgÃ¤nger,
it's not gonna work on me.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.163
He left it for if I ever have kids.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.846
Why don't you save it
for future generations...

14:25.000 --> 14:27.207
of stubborn, relentless baby Gilberts?

14:27.360 --> 14:30.443
How about you borrow it
until after we survive this?

14:30.600 --> 14:34.241
I'd feel bad if I got you killed
before happy hour.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.371
I don't know why you think
that you're a lost cause...

14:59.520 --> 15:00.646
Damon?

15:01.920 --> 15:03.046
How are you even here?

15:03.960 --> 15:06.566
Thanks for the tip, brother.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.200
You sold me out.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.809
Think I'd take you to a mountain range
of werewolves without backup?

15:17.680 --> 15:19.330
There.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.403
Good as new.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.961
Now, you relax, okay, mate?

15:26.160 --> 15:28.925
We're gonna need you
when the rest of them wake up.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.282
They're dead.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.521
They're all dead.

15:38.680 --> 15:43.686
Well, he's through his transition,
he should be feeling better soon.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.043
So is this your master plan?

15:47.680 --> 15:51.526
Build an army of hybrid slaves?

15:51.720 --> 15:55.122
No, not slaves. Soldiers.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.520
Comrades.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.370
For what war, might I ask?

15:58.560 --> 16:01.723
Well, you don't arm yourself
after war has been declared, Stefan.

16:01.880 --> 16:06.602
You build your army so big
that no one ever dares pick the fight.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.922
What makes you so sure
that they'll be loyal?

16:09.080 --> 16:12.448
It's not difficult to be loyal
when you're on the winning team.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.965
Something you'll learn...

16:14.120 --> 16:17.283
once you shake that depressive
chip off your shoulder.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.129
That's why you're keeping me around?

16:22.360 --> 16:24.283
To witness my attitude adjustment?

16:26.240 --> 16:29.050
You'll know
why I'm keeping you around...

16:29.240 --> 16:32.369
when I've decided
that I want you to know.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.363
Something's wrong.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.205
Huh.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.922
- That shouldn't be happening, should it?
- Well, obviously.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.610
Get out of the water, Elena.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.127
If I get out,
you're gonna make me go home.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.442
Yes. Because I'm not an idiot
like you.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.524
Right now, you're both acting like idiots.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.843
- You gave up on him, Damon.
- I didn't give up on him, Elena.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.002
I faced reality.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.567
- Now, get out of the water.
- No.

17:02.760 --> 17:06.127
What's your big plan, Elena? Huh?

17:07.680 --> 17:10.762
Gonna walk into a campsite
of werewolves, roast a marshmallow...

17:10.960 --> 17:12.405
wait for Stefan to stop by?

17:12.560 --> 17:14.403
My plan is to find him
and help him.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.404
Damon, this is the closest we've been
since he left.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.608
I'm not going home.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.007
Klaus thinks you died
when he broke the curse.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.241
That makes you safe.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.084
This? This is not safe.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.602
- I'm not leaving before we find him.
- It's a full moon tonight, Elena.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.802
Then we'll find him before then.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.648
Damon, please.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.041
Okay. Okay.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.363
- We're out of here before the moon's full.
- I promise.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.091
Unless you wanna relive
that whole deathbed kissy thing.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.322
- I said I promise.
- Fine.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.129
You said it was gonna feel better.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.251
Why doesn't it feel better?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.204
Some master race.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.486
Lose the attitude.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.850
Derek.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.968
Come feed your girlfriend.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.604
Go get him.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.807
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.361
- You know, I can help you.
- No, thanks.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.483
Just one little whoosh.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.166
- With my luck, you'd drop me.
- What are you guys, 12?

19:02.160 --> 19:03.571
Where did he go?

19:03.720 --> 19:06.610
He got away. Forget him. Let's go.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.888
A fatal werewolf bite.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.286
Ouch.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.444
Yeah, I'm gonna need your blood
to heal me.

19:13.600 --> 19:17.286
Well, I tell you what.
You find Ray and then I'll heal you.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.447
Heh. You can't be serious.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.410
And you better hurry,
because that bite looks nasty.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.610
You put vervain in my coffee
this morning.

20:09.880 --> 20:10.927
Why?

20:11.080 --> 20:13.651
Vervain? What are you talking about?

20:14.120 --> 20:17.442
Let's skip where we pretend we don't
know about the vampires in this town.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.645
You were testing me to see if I was
a vampire. I want to know why.

20:28.280 --> 20:34.561
You've been spending so much time
with Caroline, I had to know for sure.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.650
What does Caroline have to do with it?

20:40.880 --> 20:43.804
Let's skip the part
where we pretend she's not one of them.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.485
Did you do something to her?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.603
- I don't want you to be with her.
- Where is she?

20:48.760 --> 20:51.923
- I can't let you be together.
- What did you do? Where is she?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.491
You can't be with her.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.168
She's a monster.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.085
You don't know about me, do you?

21:06.280 --> 21:07.691
Know what?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.007
Know what, Tyler?

21:18.880 --> 21:20.689
We've got about a mile left.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.362
Sun's about to set.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.726
I can see that, Damon.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.120
I'm just saying.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.727
The moon doesn't reach its apex
for a while. We have time.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.884
Stay where you are.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.643
Vampire.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.730
Damon.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.764
Let me guess. Hybrid.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.930
So this is all her stuff.

22:26.080 --> 22:30.369
We were supposed to donate it,
but, you know.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.765
Everything I read said that personal
items help build a stronger connection.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.003
Does her pipe count?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.885
I don't know why I let you
talk me into this, man.

23:06.640 --> 23:11.407
It's because she's your sister
and you have a chance to help her.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.447
I can't do this.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.723
- You gotta go.
- Matt, please.

23:17.880 --> 23:21.282
No, man. I can't do this, all right?
You gotta go.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.850
These ropes aren't gonna hold.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.685
- What else do we have?
- Ric, here, take these.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.969
- Aah! Ow!
- I said Ric.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.921
All right, that's the last of the vervain.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.691
We don't have enough stuff to hold him.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.523
I don't think we're gonna make
that ridge before the full moon.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.365
If we can get him to talk,
we don't have to.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.882
- Is he turning?
- Impossible. It's daylight.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.643
Tell him that.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.486
There aren't werewolves
until the moon is full.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.688
Those ropes aren't gonna hold a wolf.

24:35.400 --> 24:39.007
Damon, we've gotta get out of here.
We've gotta get out of these mountains.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.484
Damon, now.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.450
Bad news, my friend.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.085
End of the road for you.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.640
Careful, love.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.165
There's only one alpha here.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.123
Bloody hell.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.962
Don't move.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.840
Here, doggy, doggy.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.324
- Come on, keep moving.
- We can't leave Damon.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.806
He can handle himself.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.645
If he gets bit, he'll be dead.
I'm the reason he's here.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.882
I'm the reason he's out here.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.128
I told him where we were.
Keep moving.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.371
Elena, now.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.167
Tyler, what is it? Just tell me.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.323
You need to see for yourself.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.084
What are you doing?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.208
You think Caroline's a monster?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.010
I'm the monster, Mom.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.764
What?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.891
Tyler? What's happening?

26:26.520 --> 26:27.760
Get in.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.602
- Get in. Get in!
- No.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.524
What are you doing?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.688
Me. Uncle Mason. It's in our blood.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.684
- It's a family curse.
- What curse?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.409
Tyler, what's happening?

26:45.840 --> 26:47.888
What's happening?

26:50.440 --> 26:51.521
Tyler.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.127
Aah! Oh, my God.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.727
No. No. No.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.929
- Fancy meeting you here.
- What part of...

27:56.080 --> 28:00.005
"Don't follow me anymore"
got lost in translation, Damon'?

28:00.240 --> 28:02.925
Might wanna take it up
with your girlfriend.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.290
You don't want her chasing you,
I'd stop with the late-night phone calls.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.287
I didn't call her.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.286
Sure you did.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.489
She's not going to give up on you.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.286
She has to.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.007
Because I'm never coming back.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.963
Why don't you get her home?

28:30.640 --> 28:32.802
See if you can keep her there
this time.

28:43.320 --> 28:47.166
Stefan's out there somewhere, and now
Damon, and we're sitting in this car.

28:47.360 --> 28:50.967
Let the vampires fight
the hybrid-zombie-mountain man.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.323
I'll take care of keeping the humans safe.

28:55.480 --> 28:59.371
I thought you were checked out
of taking care of people.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.443
I know what you're doing.

29:04.320 --> 29:07.164
Don't. There doesn't need to be
a lesson here.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.488
You're better at it than you think.

29:09.680 --> 29:12.001
Are you a sucker for a lost cause
or what?

29:12.160 --> 29:14.811
You're not a lost cause, Ric.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.844
You're just...

29:17.000 --> 29:18.764
lost.

29:20.840 --> 29:25.129
But so is Jeremy, and so am I.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.890
Our family is gone.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.483
We don't have anybody.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.042
I'm sorry, but you don't have anybody
either.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.802
So we're kind of it for each other.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.846
I'm keeping the ring, then.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.807
Damon? Are you okay?

30:06.960 --> 30:08.121
Did you...?

30:08.320 --> 30:10.243
I'm fine. Bite-free.
Get back in the car.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.171
Can you give me a minute
to appreciate you're not dead?

30:13.320 --> 30:15.402
I'll give you 10 seconds. Nine, eight.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.722
Ric, did you see
where I parked my car?

30:17.880 --> 30:20.326
- Quit being such a caveman.
- Seven.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.084
I'm sorry about earlier.

30:46.920 --> 30:50.481
Hey, don't worry about it, man.
You know, it's a lot to ask.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.120
- Come on in.
- Heh.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.286
I spent the day going through her stuff.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.207
It was weird.
You know, all the memories and...

31:05.920 --> 31:08.810
I realized that most people didn't
really get Vick.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.611
<i>You know, they saw her as trouble
and let it go at that.</i>

31:13.880 --> 31:15.882
But you really got her.

31:16.040 --> 31:19.089
You know, you got her better than I did
most of the time.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.650
So...

31:22.480 --> 31:26.121
I don't know what we're gonna do
with all this, but here.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.729
You know, I don't remember her dying.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.167
I don't know if Caroline told you that
when she told you everything.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.643
No, she didn't.

31:45.840 --> 31:52.007
Elena made them take that memory away
from me. Thought I couldn't handle it.

31:54.240 --> 31:59.849
So whatever my last moment
was with her, I don't have it.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.603
I don't either.

32:04.840 --> 32:09.368
I don't remember the last moment I had
with Vicki before she was a vampire.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.446
When she was still my sister.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.201
Matty.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.484
Do you see something?

32:29.840 --> 32:31.001
Is she here?

32:34.680 --> 32:35.886
You said you needed help.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.206
Tell me how I can help you, please.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.522
I can come back.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.045
Help me come back.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.405
What is she saying? Tell me.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.121
Jeremy

33:01.520 --> 33:03.682
Don't trust Vicki.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.522
They went rabid.

33:28.800 --> 33:35.285
Some of them I killed,
the others just bled out.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.326
In the end...

33:46.280 --> 33:47.406
they're all dead.

33:56.920 --> 34:00.242
I did everything I was told!

34:02.160 --> 34:03.889
I should be able to turn them.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.769
I broke the curse.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.206
I killed a werewolf.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.283
I killed a vampire.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.650
I killed the doppelgÃ¤nger.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.960
You look like hell.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.371
Last I checked, I'm dying.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.047
You don't wanna heal me.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.282
I had to take him out.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.208
I didn't have a choice.

34:46.360 --> 34:50.967
I failed you, I'm sorry.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.408
Do what you have to do.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.770
It should have worked.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.487
Bottoms up.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.289
We're leaving.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.090
It appears you're the only comrade
I have left.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.725
Seriously?

36:32.040 --> 36:33.644
I was wrong.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.680
Are you drunk?

36:39.440 --> 36:40.646
No.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.971
I thought Stefan was gone,
but I was wrong.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.281
You saw him out there?

36:49.160 --> 36:52.289
- Damon, is he okay?
- No, he's not okay, Elena.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.609
He's an insufferable martyr
that needs his ass kicked.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.687
But he can be saved.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.081
What happened out there?

37:06.440 --> 37:08.044
- What changed your mind?
- I changed my mind...

37:08.240 --> 37:11.687
because even in his darkest place,
my brother still can't let me die.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.241
So I figure I owe him
the same in return.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.001
I'll help you bring him back.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.363
Thank you.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.680
But before I do,
I need you to answer one question.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.960
- What made you change your mind?
- What do you mean?

37:32.120 --> 37:35.124
You were so hell-bent on staying
on that mountain. You gave up.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.886
- What changed your mind?
- We were under attack, Damon.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.964
You had a bag of weapons
and a teacher with an eternity ring.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.327
- Could have kept going.
- It was too dangerous.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.563
It was too dangerous going out there
to begin with. What was it?

37:46.720 --> 37:49.690
- Why are you being like this?
- What changed your mind, Elena?

37:50.400 --> 37:53.643
I didn't wanna see you get hurt, okay?
I was...

37:56.360 --> 37:58.010
I was worried about you.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.965
Thanks.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.723
Yes, I worry about you.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.082
Why do you even have to hear me
say it?

38:07.240 --> 38:10.881
Because when I drag my brother from
the edge and deliver him back to you...

38:11.040 --> 38:14.931
I want you to remember the things
you felt while he was gone.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.402
Good night, Elena.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.769
How's it going, Ric?

38:40.560 --> 38:42.244
Know what you're doing there?

38:45.840 --> 38:47.604
No, I don't.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.290
I'll take care of it.

39:06.120 --> 39:09.090
I'll make sure nothing happens to her.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.209
Thank you.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.489
<i>I think we made a mistake.</i>

39:17.640 --> 39:20.041
Carol, you called me to take care
of this problem.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.690
Why the sudden change of heart?

39:21.840 --> 39:24.161
Maybe a guilty conscience.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.961
Don't feel guilty. They're not human.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.485
<i>They're monsters.</i>

39:29.640 --> 39:30.801
What if we're wrong?

39:30.960 --> 39:36.922
<i>My family's been committed to this fight
for almost 150 years, Carol.</i>

39:37.080 --> 39:39.128
You married into it,
you don't understand.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.601
<i>But I do.</i>

39:42.160 --> 39:44.970
I know what my obligations are.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.130
Wait.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.807
Hello?

40:13.760 --> 40:15.410
Mrs. Lockwood?

40:19.920 --> 40:21.570
Somebody?

40:23.240 --> 40:24.924
Who's that?

40:26.440 --> 40:28.204
Mrs. Lockwood?

40:28.600 --> 40:29.681
Please.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.481
Hello, Caroline.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.081
Daddy?
