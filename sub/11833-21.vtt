WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:04.771
(sighs)

00:04.805 --> 00:06.172
They turned it down.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.542
So now what?

00:08.575 --> 00:10.744
We either try it,
or we up the offer.

00:10.777 --> 00:13.714
I think we could make it
go away for $175,000.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.216
$175,000 would break me.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.319
I got no coverage
for this, Jimmy.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.220
I know.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.188
If we go to trial --

00:22.222 --> 00:23.590
Jury's already sworn in.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.526
It would be
two or three days.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.628
It's only going to
cost you my time, which --

00:27.661 --> 00:30.363
I don't mean
the cost of the trial.

00:30.396 --> 00:34.100
I'm asking,
what do we win?

00:34.134 --> 00:36.102
I don't know, Peter.

00:36.136 --> 00:40.206
Legally, what you did
was an invasion of privacy.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.408
He has a deadly disease.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.144
And we'll certainly
argue that.

00:44.177 --> 00:47.480
I'm just telling you,
I'm not sure we'll win.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.087
Let's go to trial.

00:56.122 --> 00:58.458
I ain't taking murder two.
Why should I take that?

00:58.491 --> 01:00.160
That's life -- murder two.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.596
Why should I take that?
That's life.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.665
I'm not necessarily
recommending it, Alex.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.400
I'm just making you aware
of the state's offer.

01:07.433 --> 01:08.869
Plus, with murder two,

01:08.902 --> 01:11.738
there is some possibility
of parole. Murder one --

01:11.772 --> 01:13.139
They'll kill me in prison.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.508
I know what happens
to people like me.

01:14.541 --> 01:15.609
They'll kill me.
I know what happens.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.111
You have to beat this,
Mr. Young.

01:18.144 --> 01:21.481
Well,
I don't think I will.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.716
The woman you killed --

01:22.749 --> 01:24.284
I didn't.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.719
Allegedly killed.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.454
She was the daughter
of a college chancellor.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.524
It's got a lot of publicity,
and they don't assign

01:30.557 --> 01:33.159
Helen Gamble to cases
for her charm.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.128
You have to take care
of this. I didn't do it.

01:35.161 --> 01:38.164
You have to make them
see that. I didn't do it!

01:38.198 --> 01:40.667
Even so, you have to realize
how it looks.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.803
The police discovered
you having sex with her --

01:42.836 --> 01:43.804
But she was already dead.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.706
How many times
do I have to say it?

01:45.739 --> 01:49.309
So you just found
a dead woman in a dumpster

01:49.342 --> 01:51.411
and decided to have sex
with her?

01:51.444 --> 01:54.815
Yes, and you have
to make them see that.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.118
I ain't going down
for murder two.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.323
All right, look,

02:03.356 --> 02:05.626
we're going to have
some clothes sent over

02:05.659 --> 02:06.527
for you to wear at trial.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.894
We're going to need you
to take a shower.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.362
Why?

02:10.864 --> 02:12.866
Because you stink,
Mr. Dickson.

02:12.899 --> 02:13.634
You reek.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.837
You think I'm
some kind of animal.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.438
That's what you think.

02:19.606 --> 02:23.243
I'm a human being, Ms. Dole.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.578
A human being.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.351
(music playing)

03:15.696 --> 03:17.297
Why not go insanity?

03:17.330 --> 03:18.498
I don't think
he is insane.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.567
Plus, he insists
he didn't kill her.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.569
I assume Helen's
got her fangs out.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.670
Oh, you have no idea.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.006
Can I ask, does Lindsay
really need to be on this?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.474
Is that
a strategic question,

03:28.509 --> 03:30.811
or more you don't want her
sitting next to the guy?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.445
Probably the latter,
I admit.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.580
I'm okay --

03:33.614 --> 03:34.681
It's a court appointment.
We have to give him a defense,

03:34.715 --> 03:37.684
but we certainly don't have
to provide two attorneys.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.953
I think having a woman
at the table helps.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.723
A radio station
gave out our number.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.290
Some deejay is telling
his listeners

03:44.324 --> 03:46.459
to call us and tell us
we're scum.
Oh, great.

03:46.492 --> 03:47.728
We already knew that.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.663
I'm going to shut down
the phones for the morning,

03:49.696 --> 03:51.798
so let's everybody
take their cellulars.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.833
Jimmy, how you doing?

03:52.866 --> 03:54.635
We upped the offer
to $125,000.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.737
He turned us down.
Trial starts today.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.872
I'd go higher.
Don't start.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.473
He revealed the guy's
medical condition.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.708
He didn't fire the guy. He quit.
The jury will hit you --

04:01.742 --> 04:04.377
After our client sent out
a memo telling the whole world.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.946
The guy has AIDS, Rebecca.
His coworkers --

04:05.979 --> 04:08.048
He also has
a right to privacy.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.382
And they have a right
to be safe.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.784
All right,
enough of the arguing.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.353
$125,000 is a line
in the sand.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.889
We start trial today,
and P. S. --

04:16.890 --> 04:19.358
I've known Peter Hynes
since high school.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.327
He's not a bigot.

04:21.361 --> 04:22.529
All right,
you need second chair?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.698
Thanks. I'll pass
on the chairs here.

04:24.731 --> 04:25.832
You're personalizing.
BOBBY: Let's go.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.401
Cellulars.
We're scum today, guys.

04:28.835 --> 04:32.539
(horn blows)

04:32.573 --> 04:35.408
How did Mr. Hynes even
find out you had AIDS?

04:35.441 --> 04:38.044
We're required to take
physicals for our insurance.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.813
He owns the company.
He somehow found out

04:39.846 --> 04:41.648
when I was first diagnosed
three years ago.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.917
But he didn't tell
the other employees at Straub

04:43.950 --> 04:45.085
until last year.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.454
Yes. He suddenly decided to
circulate an interoffice memo

04:48.488 --> 04:50.791
to all employees,
which total about 90.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.794
Did he give you an explanation
as to why he did this?

04:53.827 --> 04:55.896
Yeah, concern
for their health.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.331
And what happened,
Mr. Mayfield,

04:58.364 --> 05:00.066
after this memo
was circulated?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.068
I began to be treated
differently.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.470
Some people acted
like I had the plague.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.807
Others -- they were
overtly hostile.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.810
I was no longer welcome to play
on our basketball team.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.712
We have an interoffice
accountant league,

05:11.745 --> 05:14.848
and, uh, I was invited
to stay home

05:14.881 --> 05:16.817
by our team captain.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.485
So, basically, you began
to be discriminated against.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.388
Yes. I wasn't totally
ostracized, though.

05:22.422 --> 05:23.590
There are some people
in the firm

05:23.624 --> 05:24.891
with whom
I've remained friends.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.492
There's even some people

05:26.527 --> 05:29.395
who assault me
with their sympathy.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.933
They offer me the names
of various support groups.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.869
Um...I think
they're the worst.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.371
I mean, there is
nothing more oppressive

05:38.404 --> 05:40.373
than a well-meaning sympathizer
on the loose.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.575
Mr. Mayfield?

05:42.676 --> 05:45.045
How is it no longer
tolerable to work there?

05:45.078 --> 05:47.881
Well, I went from being

05:47.914 --> 05:49.049
an accountant
in good standing --

05:49.082 --> 05:52.853
You know, one who enjoyed
a camaraderie with my coworkers

05:53.654 --> 05:55.522
to being the one with AIDS --

05:57.423 --> 05:58.491
The sick one.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.392
(clears throat)

06:00.661 --> 06:03.396
But you are the sick one,
aren't you, Mr. Mayfield?

06:03.429 --> 06:05.532
I don't prefer to see
myself that way.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.769
I understand that, sir.
And that's your right.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.837
But you have a fatal disease,
don't you?

06:11.972 --> 06:12.806
Yes.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.975
And this disease
is infectious, isn't it?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.877
It doesn't spread by inter --

06:16.910 --> 06:19.680
The disease is infectious.
Is it not, Mr. Mayfield?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.748
Through sexual intercourse
and needle use,

06:21.782 --> 06:23.550
but not casual
office contact.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.853
Well, the spread is not
limited to sex and needle use.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.655
That isn't true,
is it, Mr. Mayfield?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.456
Those are the most common
ways it is spread.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.125
It could be spread
from kissing

06:32.158 --> 06:33.827
if there were
open-mouth sores.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.496
I wasn't going around
kissing --

06:36.530 --> 06:37.864
Or if people had cuts
on their hand.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.133
I never went to work
with cuts on my hands.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.937
But what if you accidentally
did cut yourself?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.972
What if you took an elbow
playing basketball,

06:46.006 --> 06:46.973
got a nosebleed?

06:47.007 --> 06:49.109
The risks you're talking
about are so minimal --

06:49.142 --> 06:51.878
But does that mean it's
yourright to assume them

06:51.912 --> 06:53.647
on behalf
of everybody else?

06:53.680 --> 06:57.584
A fatal disease
which is infectious --

06:57.618 --> 06:59.653
Shouldn't it be
a person's right

06:59.686 --> 07:01.622
to choose whether he plays

07:01.655 --> 07:03.123
in a sport
of physical contact with you?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.459
If I had a cut on my hand,

07:06.492 --> 07:08.128
I'd probably like to know

07:08.161 --> 07:10.964
which of my colleagues
at work have AIDS.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.799
Does that make me crazy?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.868
The problem, Mr. Berluti,

07:14.901 --> 07:17.003
is that there are
prejudices and bigotries

07:17.037 --> 07:18.672
that go beyond
health issues

07:18.705 --> 07:20.240
when it comes
to people with AIDS.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.076
My client
didn't fire you, did he?

07:23.109 --> 07:24.845
Well, he may as well have.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.479
But he didn't.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.750
No.

07:32.018 --> 07:32.986
(elevator dings)

07:33.019 --> 07:35.722
(reporters shouting questions)

07:38.525 --> 07:39.926
Excuse us.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
Let us through, please.
We have nothing to say.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.831
Her name
was Hillary Brennan.

07:44.865 --> 07:48.134
She was a second-year
copywriter at Rogers and Cole.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.703
She worked downtown

07:49.736 --> 07:51.805
and would like to walk home
after work

07:51.838 --> 07:53.707
to her townhouse
in the South End.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.977
Her friends describe her
in many wonderful ways,

07:57.010 --> 08:00.714
but "Generous" and "Charitable"
are two words

08:00.747 --> 08:03.784
that had become almost
synonymous with her name.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.286
She would never pass
a homeless person

08:06.319 --> 08:08.755
without offering something.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.157
That was said
by her roommate.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.260
Well, she should have passed
this one, ladies and gentlemen.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.664
The evidence will show
that Alex Dickson

08:17.698 --> 08:20.567
raped and strangled
Hillary Brennan --

08:20.601 --> 08:22.569
strangled her to death.

08:22.603 --> 08:26.106
The evidence will show
that this man

08:26.139 --> 08:29.209
continued to rape her
after she was dead.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.779
He was still on top
of her lifeless body

08:32.813 --> 08:34.648
raping the corpse

08:34.681 --> 08:37.283
when Officer Mark Fryerson
discovered him.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.287
This is...

08:43.624 --> 08:46.292
this is the ugly part
of criminal law.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.162
We deal with crimes that...

08:51.898 --> 08:53.700
fortunately...

08:56.069 --> 08:58.338
at least this one is simple.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.307
I won't have to take up
too much of your time

09:01.341 --> 09:02.843
with the ugliness.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.784
The ugly part of criminal law

09:10.817 --> 09:12.953
is when you convict
the wrong person.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.888
Alex Dickson had sex

09:14.921 --> 09:16.957
with Hillary Brennan's
lifeless body,

09:16.990 --> 09:18.792
but he didn't kill her.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.361
You're certainly entitled
to be disgusted by this man,

09:21.394 --> 09:23.229
but you can't convict him
of murder

09:23.263 --> 09:26.867
unless the evidence supports
that finding, and it won't

09:27.968 --> 09:30.704
because somebody else
killed Hillary Brennan.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.338
It wasn't Alex Dickson.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.245
How long after you got
the call did you find him?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.314
About an hour,
maybe a little less.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.717
There's a back alley
behind Washington.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.919
It isn't lit. I decided
to go and check it.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.721
And what did you find?

09:47.754 --> 09:50.290
I heard some activity over
behind the large dumpster.

09:50.323 --> 09:54.628
I headed that way,
shined my light,

09:54.661 --> 09:56.162
and there he was.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.664
There who was?

09:57.698 --> 10:00.867
Him, the defendant.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.803
Could you see
what he was doing?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.307
He was engaged
in sexual intercourse

10:07.340 --> 10:08.775
with a nude female body.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.911
I ordered him
to get off the woman

10:10.944 --> 10:12.212
and lie on the ground
face down,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.748
at which point
I handcuffed him.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.382
I then went to check
on the woman.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.251
She was dead.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.721
Did you check to see
whether the body

10:20.754 --> 10:22.288
was warm or cold?

10:23.824 --> 10:25.626
It was still warm.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.065
She was dead
when you got there?

10:32.098 --> 10:33.366
I believe so.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.301
Did you see
my client kill her?

10:35.335 --> 10:36.703
No, I did not,

10:36.737 --> 10:37.604
but she hadn't been dead
for very long --

10:37.638 --> 10:42.075
Excuse me. Did you see
my client kill her?

10:43.243 --> 10:44.210
No.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.880
Any thumb or fingerprints
or bruise indentations

10:46.913 --> 10:48.448
that matched up
with my client?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.216
No.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.920
You also noted the woman
smelled of garbage.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.221
Yes.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.190
Any idea how she got
that smell?

10:58.224 --> 11:00.093
She was probably
in the dumpster.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.895
Thank you, Officer.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.936
I think she was hiding
in the dumpster

11:09.970 --> 11:11.004
to get away from him.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.305
Why don't you
argue that, then?

11:12.338 --> 11:15.742
I can't prove it.
This steak is so tough.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.143
Have you guys
set a date yet?

11:17.177 --> 11:20.180
June 17th. The invitations
go out next week.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.415
Okay, and then
how soon after

11:22.448 --> 11:24.017
before we have
a little Bobby?

11:24.050 --> 11:26.086
You'll be the first
to know, Helen.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.756
Of course I will.
Let me ask you guys something.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.759
A wedding, a baby --

11:32.793 --> 11:33.727
She's already
got me pregnant.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.963
How do you take these cases
and then go home?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.932
The judge
assigned it, Helen.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.033
I know,
but you could've --

11:40.066 --> 11:41.367
What's the point?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.939
I didn't mean anything,
Eugene. I was just asking.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.007
I'm sick of people asking
that question.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.943
It's a stupid question.
We get it everywhere we go.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.244
You think about that?
I don't expect

11:51.277 --> 11:53.479
to be getting it
from a D.A...
Eugene.

11:53.514 --> 11:54.781
Especially when we're
supposed to be having

11:54.815 --> 11:56.416
a nice dinner as friends.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.922
Okay. Sorry.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.096
Excuse me.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.217
(horn blows)

12:32.986 --> 12:35.321
This eye-witness is pretty much
their whole case.
So, if there's --

12:35.355 --> 12:36.456
He's a liar.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.958
Billy Bicks
never told the truth

12:37.991 --> 12:39.926
his whole life
about nothing.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.461
If I hadn't had found
that girl first,

12:41.494 --> 12:42.863
he would have been
right there

12:42.896 --> 12:44.798
taking his poke.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.466
You could quote me
on that.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.101
I don't believe I will.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.404
Alex, we need facts
to trip up Mr. Bicks.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.207
He's a liar,
that's a fact.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.043
Can you give us specific
incidents of his lying?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.845
Right here.
He's lying about this.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.815
I was never with
that girl alive.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.349
He's lying about this!

13:05.285 --> 13:06.553
Okay.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.057
We'll see you
in the courtroom.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.559
Oh, yes, he is,
right there,

13:12.593 --> 13:15.428
lying about this.
Taking his poke --

13:15.461 --> 13:16.563
that's where you would have
found Billy Bicks.

13:16.597 --> 13:18.965
Testifying out of jealousy,
that's what he's doing.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.070
We could go with that,
Eugene --

13:24.104 --> 13:25.872
The eyewitness is motivated
by jealousy

13:25.906 --> 13:27.240
because he didn't get
to take his poke

13:27.273 --> 13:28.174
with the corpse.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.876
This is all funny to you?

13:31.244 --> 13:32.112
No.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.181
No, I'm just trying
to remember certain

13:35.215 --> 13:37.383
words of advice I got
from a senior associate

13:37.417 --> 13:38.852
when I started practicing.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.621
In some cases,
sense of humor

13:40.654 --> 13:43.323
is the only thing
that'll get you through.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.225
Well, here's another
piece of advice.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.528
Sooner or later, you're gonna
lose your sense of humor.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.464
What am I missing, Eugene?

13:51.497 --> 13:54.968
You've made a careering
out of defending dirtbags.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.069
What's changed?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.838
Maybe I'm getting sick
of it.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.280
Sharon and I split again.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.452
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.486
When?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.021
Three days ago.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.223
Kendall asked me
the same question

14:17.257 --> 14:20.260
Helen did last night,
and I couldn't answer it.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.528
Then she asked me later,

14:21.562 --> 14:23.296
we got into this big fight,

14:23.329 --> 14:26.232
and here I am.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.539
Look, I could handle
this case alone. maybe --

14:32.573 --> 14:34.975
I'm going to win, Lindsay.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.443
Make no mistake about that.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.583
We'd better get in.

14:50.624 --> 14:54.628
I was at the corner
of Washington and Boylston.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.563
It was about 8:30 or so.

14:56.597 --> 14:58.498
At night?

14:58.532 --> 15:00.366
Yes.
That's when I saw him.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.702
Him being the defendant.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.169
That's correct,

15:03.203 --> 15:05.038
and he was with the woman.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.673
What woman, sir?

15:06.707 --> 15:08.642
Hillary Brennan.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.011
I identified her
from the photographs.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.613
Could you tell
what they were doing?

15:12.646 --> 15:14.681
Talking.

15:14.715 --> 15:17.217
I assume Alex
was asking her for money.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.586
Were they arguing or --
No, no, no.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.488
As a matter of fact,
she was smiling.

15:22.523 --> 15:24.591
Do you know the defendant?

15:24.625 --> 15:27.460
Yes. I've met him
on the street many times.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.263
And you're definitely sure
it was him, this man,

15:30.296 --> 15:32.699
talking to Hillary Brennan
that night?

15:32.733 --> 15:34.701
I'm positive.

15:34.735 --> 15:37.370
And you're sure
it was around 8:30?

15:37.403 --> 15:39.105
Yes, I am.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.041
Thank you.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.678
What were you doing
on the streets

15:44.711 --> 15:46.212
at 8:30, Mr. Bicks?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.214
I was
soliciting clients.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.650
Soliciting clients?

15:49.683 --> 15:51.151
You were panhandling.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.719
That's what some people
call it.

15:52.753 --> 15:55.421
You pretty much live
on the streets.
I do.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.390
And did the prosecution
buy you those nice clothes?

15:57.423 --> 15:59.425
Objection.
When a witness testifies,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.161
he puts his demeanor
into evidence.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.697
This witness has had part
of his demeanor paid for

16:03.730 --> 16:04.598
by the prosecution.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.666
And exactly where did

16:05.699 --> 16:07.400
the defendant's outfit
come from?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.235
From a charity
who helps innocent people

16:09.269 --> 16:10.470
wrongly charged with crimes.

16:10.504 --> 16:12.072
Objection --
move to strike.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.106
All right, all right,
that's enough.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.041
We will have no more
discussion as to wardrobe.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.178
The jury will not give
any weight to the clothes.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.713
You were arrested the night
of the murder,

16:19.746 --> 16:20.747
weren't you, Mr. Bicks?

16:20.781 --> 16:23.149
Yes, but much later.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.050
Drunk and disorderly conduct?

16:24.084 --> 16:26.753
I was sober
when I saw your client --

16:26.787 --> 16:28.755
How many times
have you been arrested

16:28.789 --> 16:29.790
for drunk and disorderly
conduct, sir?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.592
Objection.
Overruled.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.727
More than five?
Maybe.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.628
More than 10?

16:34.661 --> 16:35.361
I don't know.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.463
In fact,
this was your 11th time,

16:37.497 --> 16:38.799
and after the last one,

16:38.832 --> 16:41.467
you were told the next one
meant jail time.

16:41.502 --> 16:42.769
Isn't that right, Mr. Bicks?

16:42.803 --> 16:44.304
Yes.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.807
Are you going
to be serving time

16:46.840 --> 16:48.609
for your 11th arrest?

16:48.642 --> 16:49.776
I don't think so.

16:49.810 --> 16:51.578
Because you had something
to offer,

16:51.612 --> 16:52.713
didn't you, Mr. Bicks?

16:52.746 --> 16:54.380
You decided to hand over
Mr. Dickson

16:54.414 --> 16:56.482
in exchange
for serving no time.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.118
Is that why you made
this story up?

16:58.151 --> 16:58.785
Objection.

16:58.819 --> 16:59.820
Overruled.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.188
Did you make up
this story, Mr. Bicks?
No.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.057
They needed
to place my client

17:04.089 --> 17:05.391
with the victim alive,

17:05.425 --> 17:08.060
and you decided to offer
your services, didn't you?

17:08.094 --> 17:10.797
I'm not lying.
I saw him with that woman.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.132
But you did make a deal

17:12.165 --> 17:14.334
in exchange
for this testimony,

17:14.367 --> 17:15.569
didn't you, Mr. Bicks?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.337
Yes.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.339
Yes, and you say
you were sober

17:19.372 --> 17:21.307
when you saw my client
with Miss Brennan.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.342
Was that your testimony?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.276
Yes.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.178
Well, according to three
different witnesses,

17:25.211 --> 17:26.346
you were seen drinking

17:26.378 --> 17:28.281
as early as 4:00
that afternoon.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.750
But I wasn't drunk.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.585
You're an alcoholic,
aren't you, Mr. Bicks?

17:31.618 --> 17:33.453
Well, I like to drink, yeah,

17:33.486 --> 17:35.188
but whether that makes me
an alcoholic --

17:35.221 --> 17:37.223
You were seen drinking
at 4:00 that day.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.826
You were still drinking
at 11:30 when you got arrested.

17:39.860 --> 17:43.096
I was sober when
I saw him with her.

17:43.129 --> 17:45.231
Have you had a drink today,
Mr. Bicks?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.232
I'm sorry?

17:46.266 --> 17:49.703
Have you had a drink today?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.437
Well, I've had one.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.841
You had one.
Let the record reflect

17:54.875 --> 18:00.113
It's 10:15 in the morning.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.649
Nothing further.

18:15.161 --> 18:19.165
You'd known he'd had AIDS
for three years.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.536
Yes, and I kept the secret.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.771
Well, what changed?

18:24.805 --> 18:29.409
I saw on the news...

18:29.442 --> 18:32.178
These two guys stopped
to help this guy

18:32.212 --> 18:34.214
in a car accident.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.649
He wasn't breathing.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.184
They both did mouth-to-mouth.

18:38.218 --> 18:42.455
Turned out that
the accident victim had AIDS,

18:42.488 --> 18:44.758
And now these two samaritans
are at risk.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.259
They have to go
for AIDS tests

18:46.292 --> 18:47.493
for the next few years.

18:47.528 --> 18:49.896
So I thought,

18:49.930 --> 18:51.898
what if something
like that happens here?

18:51.932 --> 18:55.602
Suppose Wayne
has a heart attack

18:55.636 --> 18:56.937
or he blacks out.

18:56.970 --> 19:01.274
It certainly is possible,
given his immune system.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.844
And then suppose
somebody at work goes

19:03.877 --> 19:06.179
to resuscitate him.

19:06.212 --> 19:08.615
I mean, wouldn't I be
a little bit liable?

19:08.649 --> 19:10.851
I know he has AIDS.
I don't tell?

19:10.884 --> 19:13.587
You know, the people
who work for me --

19:13.620 --> 19:16.256
So you felt it was
your legal responsibility.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.292
And my moral one,
to be honest.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.628
I put my trust
in these people,

19:21.662 --> 19:26.299
and I ask these people
to trust me.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.870
How can I sit
on information

19:29.903 --> 19:33.339
that could possibly
threaten their lives?

19:35.576 --> 19:37.377
Did any doctor advise you

19:37.410 --> 19:39.312
that Mr. Mayfield
might be a health risk

19:39.345 --> 19:40.647
to anybody else?

19:40.681 --> 19:41.515
No.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.316
Did any medical
professional advise you

19:43.349 --> 19:46.687
to reveal
my client's condition?

19:46.720 --> 19:49.723
No, but probably
because doctors

19:49.756 --> 19:50.957
are more afraid
of being sued

19:50.991 --> 19:51.692
than anybody.

19:51.725 --> 19:53.727
Did you consider
the possibility

19:53.760 --> 19:56.229
that Mr. Mayfield
may be stigmatized

19:56.262 --> 19:57.463
by your memo,

19:57.497 --> 20:00.567
That he might suffer
from discrimination

20:00.601 --> 20:03.737
as a result
of this disclosure?

20:03.770 --> 20:06.406
Yes, but I weighed that risk

20:06.439 --> 20:10.343
against the potentially
fatal one facing the others,

20:10.376 --> 20:12.879
and I made my decision.

20:12.913 --> 20:13.747
I'd also like to say

20:13.780 --> 20:16.316
I feel that the company
supported Wayne.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.317
He resents sympathy,

20:17.350 --> 20:19.252
As he stated
in his testimony,

20:19.285 --> 20:20.954
And a lot
of the discrimination

20:20.987 --> 20:22.656
he says
he was subjected to,

20:22.689 --> 20:26.593
the bulk of it
he only perceived.

20:26.627 --> 20:29.763
The employees at Straub
like him,

20:29.796 --> 20:31.431
and following my disclosure,

20:31.464 --> 20:35.435
nobody came to me
asking that he be let go,

20:35.468 --> 20:39.339
and I think that needs
to be said.

20:46.780 --> 20:48.882
And you said it perfectly.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.050
How's it going?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.351
He totally stoned him.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.386
They're now willing
to take $125,000.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.623
Really?
We rejected it.
You should have seen him.

20:56.657 --> 20:58.925
Is the jury still out?

20:58.959 --> 21:00.561
No, we go back in at 5:00
for closing arguments,

21:00.594 --> 21:02.629
which I got to get
to work on. Come on, Peter.

21:02.663 --> 21:04.397
How about when I said
it was a moral thing?

21:04.430 --> 21:05.899
Did you see his face when
I said that?

21:05.932 --> 21:08.401
Did I see it? I could hear
it when it hit the floor.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.469
They were so cocky.

21:09.503 --> 21:11.938
But that's the way they are,
Jimmy, I'm telling you.

21:11.972 --> 21:13.707
They get all this
special treatment.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.842
You know, they get all these
special laws passed.

21:15.876 --> 21:17.544
They got the whole country
screaming,

21:17.578 --> 21:18.912
"Let them get married!"

21:18.945 --> 21:21.414
It's like they're
some privileged class

21:21.447 --> 21:22.315
or something.

21:22.348 --> 21:24.818
Favored nation fags --
It's out of control.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.654
And they think they're
smarter than everybody, too.

21:27.688 --> 21:31.592
That's why they thought
they'd win this.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.833
I ever tell you
my mother was gay, Peter?

21:39.866 --> 21:42.035
What?

21:42.068 --> 21:44.004
Oh, funny. Ha ha.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.940
No, it's true.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.809
Maybe I didn't mention it

21:48.842 --> 21:51.545
'cause I didn't think
it was such a big deal,

21:51.578 --> 21:53.947
that it would matter
to my friends.

21:54.615 --> 21:57.518
Oh, hey, Jimmy,
to each his own.

21:57.551 --> 22:00.020
Now, come on,
you know me.

22:00.854 --> 22:02.789
Look, I got no problem
with people living

22:02.823 --> 22:04.024
the way they want.

22:04.057 --> 22:04.925
It's just...

22:07.460 --> 22:08.762
You know.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.664
The special treatment.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.098
Yes.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.972
Well, I better work
on my closing.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.975
You know what
you're going to say?

22:23.143 --> 22:25.345
I have an idea.

22:37.691 --> 22:40.661
The body cools down
about 1 degree per hour

22:40.694 --> 22:44.064
in 65 degree weather, which
it was that evening.

22:44.097 --> 22:47.433
We recorded a base
temperature of 95.5.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.936
That was just
after midnight.

22:49.970 --> 22:52.172
Computing the 1 degree
per hour, we calculated

22:52.205 --> 22:54.641
the time of death to be
between 9:00 and 10:00.

22:54.675 --> 22:57.811
But since the officer
found her dead at 9:30,

22:57.844 --> 23:01.548
we determined the T.O.D.
to be between 9:00 and 9:30.

23:01.582 --> 23:04.785
Were you able to determine
the cause of death, Dr. Fine?

23:04.818 --> 23:08.689
Asphyxiation caused
by strangulation.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.025
Between 9:00 and 9:30.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.827
So Ms. Brennan
could have been killed

23:13.860 --> 23:15.762
at one minute past 9:00.

23:15.796 --> 23:16.697
Possible?

23:16.730 --> 23:18.532
Possible.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.433
So, my client's contention
that he found the body

23:20.466 --> 23:22.869
already dead
at around 9:15,

23:22.903 --> 23:26.472
then proceeding to make love
to it after she was dead --

23:26.507 --> 23:27.173
That's possible,
isn't it?

23:27.207 --> 23:29.610
It's possible,
but it's --

23:29.643 --> 23:30.511
Well, in fact,
scientifically

23:30.544 --> 23:33.446
You can't rule out
that possibility at all.

23:33.479 --> 23:36.650
No, I can't rule it out.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.051
In fact, a body temperature
will spike

23:38.084 --> 23:42.188
if a person was struggling
prior to death, wouldn't it?

23:42.222 --> 23:43.690
She could have been
at 100 when she died.

23:43.724 --> 23:44.825
Isn't that possible?

23:45.726 --> 23:46.593
Yes.

23:46.627 --> 23:47.994
So she might
have been killed

23:48.028 --> 23:51.532
as early as 7:00, 7:30.

23:51.565 --> 23:54.067
Well, a witness
saw her alive at 8:30.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.736
So you're basing
your findings

23:55.769 --> 23:59.139
in part on the reliability
of the witness Billy Bicks.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.107
Yes, I am.

24:01.141 --> 24:02.743
Thank you, Dr. Fine.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.912
The witness may step down.

24:07.714 --> 24:08.649
Ms. Gamble.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.484
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.020
Mr. Young, you're on.

24:18.258 --> 24:20.794
The defense rests,
Your Honor.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.564
(indistinct chatter)

24:30.270 --> 24:33.106
How do you mean,
I don't testify?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.741
I mean, you don't testify.

24:34.775 --> 24:36.510
What's with that?
if I don't tell my side,

24:36.543 --> 24:37.711
They're going to think I did it.
I got your side in.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.279
What's with that?
If we put you on the stand,

24:39.312 --> 24:41.982
all your other felonies
come in, including the time

24:42.015 --> 24:44.250
you flashed kids
at an elementary school.

24:44.284 --> 24:46.953
That doesn't make me a killer.
It makes you a piece of crap,

24:46.987 --> 24:47.954
which we don't need
the jury to hear.

24:47.988 --> 24:49.956
They already think that.
I slept with that woman.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.124
If you take the stand,
they'll know it.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.192
LINDSAY: Okay, all right.

24:52.225 --> 24:53.093
I don't like this.
What's going on?

24:53.126 --> 24:55.128
You have to trust us
on this, Mr. Dickson.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.863
I don't put on any defense.
What the hell is that?

24:56.897 --> 24:57.998
You don't have any defense.
You were caught

24:58.031 --> 24:59.733
red-handed
raping the victim.

24:59.766 --> 25:00.767
After she was dead!

25:00.801 --> 25:02.636
Alex, the jury
won't believe you.
How do you know?

25:02.669 --> 25:03.804
'Cause I don't believe you.
LINDSAY: Eugene!

25:03.837 --> 25:05.739
I think you did it. You
strangled her, then raped her.

25:05.772 --> 25:06.640
That's what I think,
'cause I've had

25:06.673 --> 25:08.642
the pleasure
of listening to you talk.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.712
I don't want the jury to hear
you open your fat mouth,

25:11.745 --> 25:13.914
cause then they'll know
you did it, just like I do.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.982
I have an obligation
to protect you, Alex,

25:16.016 --> 25:17.017
and your fat mouth.

25:17.050 --> 25:18.284
You listen to me!

25:18.318 --> 25:19.720
You don't want
to mess with me!

25:19.753 --> 25:22.088
Eugene, stop it!

25:36.002 --> 25:39.906
Mr. Dickson,
our defense is the state

25:39.940 --> 25:41.908
hasn't satisfied
its burden of proof.

25:41.942 --> 25:42.809
With that strategy,

25:42.843 --> 25:44.911
it's better not to call
any witnesses.

25:44.945 --> 25:46.246
That's why
we're not calling you.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.849
Certainly, it's your right
to testify,

25:48.882 --> 25:51.752
and if you insist,
we will allow you to do so,

25:51.785 --> 25:52.953
but it is
our collective judgment

25:52.986 --> 25:55.789
it's better
for us to rest

25:55.822 --> 25:57.658
without putting on
a defense,

25:57.691 --> 25:59.893
and focus the jury
on the state's failure

25:59.926 --> 26:01.595
to make its burden.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.831
And as it stands, we have
a very good chance.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.071
I don't know what's going on,

26:11.104 --> 26:15.341
but gay bashing seems to be
coming back into style.

26:15.375 --> 26:17.611
We've got
radio talk show hosts

26:17.644 --> 26:19.946
proudly declaring
their prejudices,

26:19.980 --> 26:24.618
churches and politicians
calling gay people "sick,"

26:24.651 --> 26:26.319
voters coming out in droves

26:26.352 --> 26:28.922
to support bans
on gay marriages.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.592
What is going on?

26:32.125 --> 26:34.127
As far as fear of AIDS goes,

26:34.995 --> 26:37.931
you want something
really to be scared about?

26:39.099 --> 26:42.068
Abolish people's right
to medical privacy,

26:42.102 --> 26:44.104
and they simply
won't get tested.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.741
They'll stop going
to the doctors.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.643
Then watch
the disease spread --

26:49.676 --> 26:51.011
Many diseases.

26:52.713 --> 26:55.782
This man went
and got tested,

26:57.083 --> 26:58.685
and he was punished for it.

27:00.153 --> 27:03.123
Is that the message
we want to be sending?

27:03.156 --> 27:05.225
Because if that's it,

27:05.258 --> 27:09.062
then a plague
on all our houses.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.402
What's he talking about --

27:16.436 --> 27:18.805
gay backlash?

27:18.839 --> 27:22.008
Gays have got
more special treatment going

27:22.042 --> 27:23.343
than anybody.

27:23.376 --> 27:26.680
We got special AIDS laws.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.849
Hollywood -- the Emmys,
the Oscars --

27:28.882 --> 27:31.752
they all got those
red ribbons on, don't they,

27:31.785 --> 27:33.319
in honor of AIDS?

27:33.353 --> 27:36.122
My dad died
of a heart attack.

27:36.156 --> 27:39.726
Where's the ribbon
for cardiovascular disease?

27:39.760 --> 27:42.162
And now, when a person has

27:42.195 --> 27:45.398
a fatal, deadly,
infectious disease,

27:45.431 --> 27:49.836
there's a law that says
you can't even warn people.

27:49.870 --> 27:51.772
Nobody's saying
we should discriminate

27:51.805 --> 27:53.707
against people with AIDS,

27:53.740 --> 27:56.442
but where's the law
to protect you and me?

27:56.476 --> 27:58.344
Where's the legislation

27:58.378 --> 28:01.347
to protect
Mr. Mayfield's co-workers?

28:01.381 --> 28:03.817
If he dropped,
a dozen different people

28:03.850 --> 28:05.886
would be giving him
mouth-to-mouth.

28:05.919 --> 28:08.021
If he got cut
playing basketball,

28:08.054 --> 28:11.057
his teammates would help
tend to it.

28:11.091 --> 28:12.759
They don't have
a right to know

28:12.793 --> 28:15.361
they could be risking
their lives?

28:15.395 --> 28:18.098
How nuts is that?

28:18.131 --> 28:20.934
Doesn't Mr. Hynes
owe some duty

28:20.967 --> 28:23.236
to look out for the people
who work for him?

28:23.269 --> 28:26.873
He did the moral thing,

28:26.907 --> 28:29.375
the reasonable thing.

28:29.409 --> 28:32.412
And let's remind ourselves
one more time --

28:32.445 --> 28:34.848
the plaintiff
didn't get fired.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.249
Nobody beat him up.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.351
Mr. Mayfield says
he even felt depressed

28:38.384 --> 28:40.120
by the people
who were trying to help him,

28:40.153 --> 28:41.788
for God's sakes.

28:41.822 --> 28:44.057
Maybe we should pass
another law.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.392
It's a crime to show
too much sympathy

28:46.426 --> 28:47.761
for people with AIDS.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.330
Enough...

28:51.464 --> 28:52.498
is enough.

29:10.951 --> 29:12.418
How we doing?

29:12.452 --> 29:14.254
I think okay.

29:17.157 --> 29:18.458
How you doing?

29:20.894 --> 29:22.863
I'm fine, Lindsay.
Eugene --

29:22.896 --> 29:24.998
Don't start playing
psychologist with me, okay?

29:27.100 --> 29:28.869
Are you seeing
a psychologist?

29:28.902 --> 29:31.004
Because I think
you should be.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.205
That right?

29:32.238 --> 29:37.477
Yes. Every time you take cases
like this, you turn angry.

29:37.511 --> 29:39.012
I mean, the Rabbi rapist--
It doesn't have
to be fun, Lindsay.

29:39.045 --> 29:40.581
The pedophile who killed--
What am I supposed to do,
be all happy and giddy?

29:40.614 --> 29:41.815
those kids, who you then
beat up in court!

29:41.848 --> 29:45.051
These cases
don't bother me, okay?
Whatever you're feeling --

29:45.085 --> 29:47.087
I don't feel anything.
I'm a defense attorney.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.356
It's not my job to feel.
Why can't people see that?

30:00.500 --> 30:03.369
I have work to do
here, Lindsay.

30:12.579 --> 30:13.947
I think I should
do the closing.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.016
I will do it.

30:16.049 --> 30:17.350
If you can't
do your best --

30:17.383 --> 30:19.085
I will do my very best.

30:20.554 --> 30:21.555
Cases like this --

30:23.423 --> 30:25.391
I get so afraid I'll let
my personal disgust

30:25.425 --> 30:27.193
affect my, uh...

30:30.363 --> 30:33.399
I compensate
by trying harder.

30:35.902 --> 30:38.338
If anything, I try
even harder for the guilty.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.410
How sick is that?

31:00.360 --> 31:01.394
They've reached
a verdict already?

31:01.427 --> 31:02.629
I'm on my way.

31:02.663 --> 31:06.199
Jimmy, my spies
down at the courthouse

31:06.232 --> 31:09.202
said that your closing
seemed a little rednecked.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.336
What spies?

31:10.370 --> 31:12.673
I got spies.
What about your closing?

31:12.706 --> 31:14.941
I went with what I thought
would be effective.

31:14.975 --> 31:16.109
Redneck?

31:16.142 --> 31:18.478
Red, white and blue.

31:19.412 --> 31:20.480
I better go.

31:24.718 --> 31:26.620
(door opens)

31:26.653 --> 31:28.889
(horn blows)

31:30.423 --> 31:34.094
If there is a question
defense attorneys get asked

31:34.127 --> 31:36.496
more than anything
else, it's...

31:38.632 --> 31:39.666
"how can you do it?"

31:42.035 --> 31:45.972
How can you walk into court
day after day after day

31:46.006 --> 31:48.108
defending
the scum of the earth,

31:48.141 --> 31:50.644
then go home and sleep?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.683
Well, I got myself
a pretty good piece of scum

31:56.717 --> 31:58.351
in this one, don't I?

31:58.384 --> 31:59.653
He raped a dead woman.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.288
Hard enough for me
to even look at him,

32:02.322 --> 32:04.024
let alone defend him,

32:04.057 --> 32:06.560
but the answer
to the question is,

32:06.593 --> 32:08.562
I don't come in here
day after day

32:08.595 --> 32:10.463
representing
people like him.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.299
I represent you and me.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.435
I'm in here making sure
the prosecution

32:15.468 --> 32:17.571
lives up to its burden
of proving guilt

32:17.604 --> 32:19.239
beyond a reasonable doubt

32:19.272 --> 32:21.575
before they get
to incarcerate people,

32:21.608 --> 32:23.644
because if they don't
live up to that burden,

32:23.677 --> 32:25.445
if we start
letting them convict

32:25.478 --> 32:27.347
without meeting that criteria,

32:27.380 --> 32:29.550
then innocent people
are at risk --

32:29.583 --> 32:33.019
you and me...

32:33.053 --> 32:35.055
and maybe him, too.

32:35.088 --> 32:37.057
I don't know.
Maybe he killed that woman,

32:37.090 --> 32:38.625
maybe he didn't.
I can't tell you.

32:38.659 --> 32:43.096
What I can say is they didn't
satisfy their burden.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.431
There is doubt
all over the place.

32:45.465 --> 32:47.467
Nobody saw him
commit a murder.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.570
The coroner himself said
the murder could have happened

32:49.603 --> 32:52.072
hours before
the police officer found him.

32:52.105 --> 32:53.774
It is not likely
he's going to hang around

32:53.807 --> 32:55.475
with his victims
for hours, is it?

32:55.509 --> 32:59.045
No thumbprints or bruises
on the neck matching my client.

32:59.079 --> 33:01.682
The victim
smelled like garbage. Why?

33:01.715 --> 33:03.383
Because she was
in that dumpster

33:03.416 --> 33:06.386
just like my client said
she was when he found her.

33:06.419 --> 33:10.156
One witness who places
my client with the victim alive

33:10.190 --> 33:13.126
turns out to be a drunk,
likely drunk at the time.

33:13.159 --> 33:16.396
Can we really trust
his powers of observation

33:16.429 --> 33:17.798
or his credibility?

33:17.831 --> 33:20.433
The testimony he gave
was part of a deal

33:20.466 --> 33:21.568
that kept him out of jail.

33:21.602 --> 33:24.304
Deal. What I should say
is bribe.

33:24.337 --> 33:27.741
He had a motive to lie.

33:27.774 --> 33:29.375
Now, the only thing
they can prove

33:29.409 --> 33:32.312
is that my client
was having sex with a dead body.

33:32.345 --> 33:33.346
Does that make him vile?

33:33.379 --> 33:35.448
Absolutely,
but it in no way proves

33:35.481 --> 33:36.583
he committed a homicide.

33:36.617 --> 33:40.486
It certainly doesn't prove it
beyond a reasonable doubt.

33:40.521 --> 33:44.691
Ms. Gamble started things off
calling this "ugly."

33:44.725 --> 33:46.092
It is.

33:46.126 --> 33:47.794
Sometimes the job is ugly.

33:47.828 --> 33:51.497
I got to come in here and fight
for a system I believe in

33:51.532 --> 33:54.167
even when I don't like
my client.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.102
And it gets ugly
for juries, too,

33:56.136 --> 33:58.171
'cause doing your job here

33:58.204 --> 34:01.542
means finding that man
not guilty.

34:01.575 --> 34:05.145
It absolutely means
that under the facts we have.

34:05.178 --> 34:08.081
Now, I can't stop you
from saying,

34:08.114 --> 34:09.349
"the hell with the rules."

34:09.382 --> 34:10.784
I can't prevent you

34:10.817 --> 34:12.418
from lowering
the burden of proof

34:12.452 --> 34:14.154
if that's
what you choose to do.

34:14.187 --> 34:16.489
I will ask you to consider --

34:17.858 --> 34:21.127
what if one day you
or somebody you love

34:21.161 --> 34:24.764
is charged with a crime
you or he didn't commit?

34:24.797 --> 34:27.601
How would you feel
if you, he, or she

34:27.634 --> 34:30.504
got a jury who dispensed
with the burden of proof

34:30.536 --> 34:33.139
and just said,
"close enough"?

34:34.741 --> 34:36.743
It happens.

34:37.777 --> 34:39.513
It goes against
the very grain

34:39.545 --> 34:41.547
of our criminal justice
system, but it happens.

34:41.581 --> 34:44.350
It violates every principle
of our constitution,

34:44.384 --> 34:45.118
but it happens.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.887
The only question
we have here --

34:46.920 --> 34:49.289
is it going to happen today?

34:50.757 --> 34:54.159
It is possible
that he did find her dead.

34:54.194 --> 34:55.460
It's possible.
There's nothing they can do

34:55.495 --> 34:57.163
to disprove that possibility,

34:57.197 --> 34:58.699
definitely not beyond
a reasonable doubt.

34:58.732 --> 35:00.300
That's a fact --

35:00.333 --> 35:03.169
a fact you can take
back into that room.

35:07.373 --> 35:10.577
In order
for the system to work,

35:10.611 --> 35:13.413
we need the defense attorneys
to do their jobs

35:13.446 --> 35:16.883
even when it's unpopular
to do so.

35:16.917 --> 35:20.654
In order
for the system to work,

35:22.388 --> 35:26.292
we need the juries
to do their jobs.

35:30.764 --> 35:32.465
Like Ms. Gamble said,

35:35.501 --> 35:37.170
sometimes the job is ugly.

36:04.531 --> 36:06.667
In very few cases

36:06.700 --> 36:08.802
is the defendant
actually seen

36:08.835 --> 36:11.572
committing the murder.

36:11.605 --> 36:14.307
The jury is allowed
to consider

36:14.340 --> 36:17.544
circumstantial evidence
when making its finding.

36:17.578 --> 36:21.615
Here, the defendant was found
raping the victim

36:21.648 --> 36:24.417
while her body
was still warm.

36:25.852 --> 36:27.854
Our system
of criminal justice

36:27.888 --> 36:31.191
doesn't preclude you
from using common sense.

36:32.693 --> 36:35.829
Anything is possible,
ladies and gentlemen,

36:35.862 --> 36:38.832
and our burden --

36:38.865 --> 36:42.368
it isn't proof
beyond all doubt.

36:42.402 --> 36:47.407
It's proof
beyond all reasonable doubt.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.409
He was seen with her alive,

36:49.442 --> 36:51.578
he was discovered
with her dead.

36:52.913 --> 36:54.347
Gee, I wonder what happened.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.871
In the matter
of Mayfield Vs Strobe Industries

37:17.904 --> 37:20.507
We find in favor
of the plaintiff

37:20.541 --> 37:23.610
Wayne Mayfield,
and order the defendant

37:23.644 --> 37:27.581
to pay damages
in the amount of $25.

37:27.848 --> 37:28.882
(indistinct chatter)

37:28.915 --> 37:31.885
The jury is dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

37:31.918 --> 37:33.386
We are adjourned.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.689
(bangs gavel)

37:35.722 --> 37:37.323
Did he say $25?

37:37.357 --> 37:38.592
Yep.

37:39.526 --> 37:42.495
(chuckles)
We won, basically.

37:42.529 --> 37:46.332
Yeah, you did, Pete.
You're a big winner.

37:46.366 --> 37:48.034
It was your closing, Jimmy.

37:48.068 --> 37:51.337
Well, you inspired it.

37:54.841 --> 37:57.711
You got something to say?

37:57.744 --> 37:59.379
Yeah.

37:59.412 --> 38:01.582
I think you're a bigot.

38:01.615 --> 38:04.384
I also think you
revealing his condition --

38:04.417 --> 38:06.452
You probably meant
to create a climate

38:06.486 --> 38:09.355
that would make him
want to leave.

38:09.389 --> 38:11.692
Mission accomplished,
Pete.

38:11.725 --> 38:15.529
Hey, growing up,

38:15.562 --> 38:17.764
I mean, you thought they
were just as sick as I did.

38:17.798 --> 38:18.832
Come on.

38:19.900 --> 38:23.036
The difference
is I grew up.

38:39.786 --> 38:41.788
Did I handle myself okay?

38:43.724 --> 38:46.426
You did great.

38:46.459 --> 38:47.761
I got goose bumps.

38:47.794 --> 38:50.797
I was suddenly proud to be
a defense attorney again.

38:50.831 --> 38:53.499
I'm not so sure
you should be that proud.

38:55.836 --> 38:57.337
Do you really mean that?

38:59.606 --> 39:02.475
You know, we're trained
not to ask ourselves

39:02.509 --> 39:04.410
the big question --

39:04.444 --> 39:06.880
"how can you defend
murderers and rapists?"

39:06.913 --> 39:09.049
We're trained
not to go near that

39:09.082 --> 39:11.552
because if we do,
we'll end up a mess.

39:11.585 --> 39:15.622
So we stay away --
far away --

39:15.656 --> 39:19.893
till one day we don't even
recognize the question.

39:20.894 --> 39:22.395
And when people ask us,

39:22.428 --> 39:23.997
we just look at them like,

39:24.030 --> 39:27.768
"you don't get it,
that's all,"

39:27.801 --> 39:30.704
like they're the ones
who are lost.

39:31.872 --> 39:33.507
Then it hits you --

39:35.776 --> 39:37.778
maybe we're the ones
who are lost.

39:45.719 --> 39:50.390
There is honor
in what you do, Eugene.

39:50.924 --> 39:53.827
You may not believe
your own words in there,

39:54.928 --> 39:57.063
but I do.

39:59.700 --> 40:03.069
She said I can't feel.

40:03.103 --> 40:04.470
Who?

40:04.505 --> 40:05.739
Sharon.

40:08.074 --> 40:09.543
And she's right.

40:11.211 --> 40:13.547
I can't feel.

40:13.580 --> 40:15.816
I'm afraid
to let myself feel.

40:17.584 --> 40:21.154
Maybe that's why I can be
so damn honorable.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.200
Lock up when you go?

40:34.234 --> 40:36.202
Yeah.

40:38.572 --> 40:40.106
Hey, ma.

40:40.140 --> 40:42.142
Nah, I'm still at the office.

40:42.175 --> 40:44.110
Just getting ready to leave.

40:44.945 --> 40:47.514
Oh, you got company?
I'll let you go.

40:49.616 --> 40:50.751
No, no, nothing's wrong.

40:50.784 --> 40:53.654
I was just calling
to say hi, that's all.

40:55.055 --> 40:56.557
How's everything going?

40:59.025 --> 41:01.127
Yeah, same.

41:01.161 --> 41:02.495
Pretty normal.

41:03.764 --> 41:05.732
No, no, nothing's wrong.

41:05.766 --> 41:08.068
I was just calling --

41:09.135 --> 41:12.272
let you know I was
thinking of you, that's all.

41:12.305 --> 41:15.041
Well, we'll talk tomorrow.

41:16.610 --> 41:17.611
All right.

41:19.079 --> 41:20.747
Love you, too.

41:55.248 --> 41:56.282
(clears throat)

41:56.316 --> 41:57.884
Will the defendant
please rise?

42:00.654 --> 42:02.523
Has the jury reached
its verdict?

42:03.657 --> 42:04.658
We have, your honor.

42:04.691 --> 42:05.692
What say you?

42:09.730 --> 42:11.665
Count 32623.

42:11.698 --> 42:14.601
On the charge of murder
in the first degree,

42:14.635 --> 42:16.903
we find the defendant
Alex Dickson...

42:18.038 --> 42:19.272
not guilty.

42:20.373 --> 42:22.175
On the count of murder
in the second degree,

42:22.208 --> 42:24.711
we find the defendant,
not guilty.

42:25.846 --> 42:28.915
On the count of lascivious
and unnatural acts,

42:28.949 --> 42:32.719
we find the defendant,
guilty.

42:32.753 --> 42:34.588
The defendant
is sentenced six months,

42:34.621 --> 42:35.956
credited with time served.

42:35.989 --> 42:37.724
He's free to go.

42:37.758 --> 42:39.192
This concludes
the jury's service.

42:39.225 --> 42:40.093
We are adjourned.

42:40.126 --> 42:41.327
(bangs gavel)

42:41.361 --> 42:44.598
(indistinct chatter)

42:44.631 --> 42:46.332
I don't believe it.

42:46.366 --> 42:47.801
I don't believe it.

42:47.834 --> 42:49.870
So, can I go?

42:49.903 --> 42:51.337
Check with probation,
and then you can go.

43:02.015 --> 43:04.284
MAN: Here he comes!
Mr. Young, over here!

43:04.317 --> 43:07.320
(reporters shouting questions)

43:07.353 --> 43:08.221
Mr. Young!

43:08.254 --> 43:09.289
Please come back
over here!

43:09.322 --> 43:11.658
Say something
to the press!

43:39.152 --> 43:41.087
(music playing)

44:05.445 --> 44:06.647
You stinker!
