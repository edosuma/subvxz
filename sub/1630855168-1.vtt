WEBVTT

00:20.675 --> 00:23.678
Special Forces,
Special Forces, Special Forces,

00:23.816 --> 00:27.130
reaching out to any Colonials,
reaching out to any...

00:41.075 --> 00:42.939
Special Forces, Zeke,

00:43.077 --> 00:44.320
reaching out to any
reaching to any,

00:44.458 --> 00:45.907
reaching out to any Colonials.

00:47.219 --> 00:48.669
I'm the last surviving,
I'm the last surviving,

00:48.807 --> 00:49.739
I'm the last surviving.

00:49.877 --> 00:51.430
This is day 20,000.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.781
I'm the last surviving
member of my squadron.

00:57.919 --> 00:59.197
This is day 20,802.

01:01.337 --> 01:02.545
Oh, wait.

01:02.683 --> 01:04.305
20,803.

01:06.756 --> 01:08.482
The Exiles have
taken everything.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.278
Earth is in ruins.

01:12.796 --> 01:16.524
If there are any Colonials
out there, please respond.

03:01.353 --> 03:03.528
Sunshine!

03:03.666 --> 03:04.908
Sunshine!

03:05.046 --> 03:08.153
Still
not waking up, huh?

03:08.291 --> 03:11.018
Well, I've got
something for you.

03:12.364 --> 03:13.469
Hey!

03:13.607 --> 03:14.987
Hey, stop!

03:15.125 --> 03:17.473
I asked nicely,
but you didn't wake up.

03:17.611 --> 03:18.543
Spark!

03:18.681 --> 03:19.613
I will end you!

03:21.201 --> 03:22.995
You've programmed
me to wake you up

03:23.133 --> 03:26.344
at approximately 6:00
AM every morning,

03:26.482 --> 03:29.312
yet you still sleep
in like a teenager.

03:30.796 --> 03:34.248
If I was born your parent, I'd
show you the meaning of an-

03:34.386 --> 03:35.974
Alarm clocks!

03:36.112 --> 03:38.287
I'll show
you something alarming.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.706
Your move.

03:43.844 --> 03:48.780
I will end you!

03:50.471 --> 03:51.196
Dad?

03:51.334 --> 03:52.439
Hey, son.

03:52.577 --> 03:55.235
Uh, wow. You look,
uh, interesting.

03:55.373 --> 03:58.099
Hey, sweetie. Oh, I
think your hair looks cute.

03:58.238 --> 03:58.928
Ah.

03:59.066 --> 04:00.240
Yeah.

04:00.378 --> 04:03.657
Uh, Dad, like, why
did we allow our robots

04:03.795 --> 04:05.486
to have so much personality?

04:05.624 --> 04:07.212
That robot, Spark,

04:07.350 --> 04:09.352
is there to keep you
disciplined, son.

04:09.490 --> 04:12.424
Eugh. More like a babysitter.

04:12.562 --> 04:15.255
Listen, your role
in this mission,

04:15.393 --> 04:17.429
it will determine
the fate of humanity.

04:18.810 --> 04:21.813
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got this, Pops.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.782
Sweetie, how are you getting
on with Allie and Jesse?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.922
Uh.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.234
- What?
- Look,

04:29.372 --> 04:30.131
we're kind of in the middle
of something.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.754
Just...
All right.

04:31.892 --> 04:34.584
As I was saying,
this mission also determines

04:34.722 --> 04:38.139
whether or not you will become
a full-fledged Colonial.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.071
All Right!

04:40.383 --> 04:41.936
I heard you. Don't worry, guys.

04:43.421 --> 04:46.182
Okay, I promise, when I
land, I'll send you a full,

04:46.320 --> 04:49.047
detailed report of
my discoveries, okay?

04:49.185 --> 04:50.635
So, uh...

04:50.773 --> 04:52.395
- Son?
- Tell Mom I love her,

04:52.533 --> 04:55.536
and I'm on the way to
the hangar for inspection.

04:55.674 --> 04:57.020
Honey, do
you know where...

04:57.158 --> 04:58.815
- Dad?
- I don't know.

04:58.953 --> 05:00.058
Do you you swipe right.

05:00.196 --> 05:01.577
- Dad?
- I win!

05:01.715 --> 05:02.612
Whoa!

05:02.750 --> 05:04.062
Spark!

05:04.200 --> 05:05.235
No! No!

05:10.862 --> 05:13.623
What's going on in here?

05:13.761 --> 05:15.901
- Are we done?
- Um, Allie and Jesse.

05:16.039 --> 05:17.317
Are you good?

05:17.455 --> 05:19.560
Well, more
like babysitter.

05:19.698 --> 05:20.768
All right, Spark?

05:20.906 --> 05:22.701
I make us look good.

05:22.839 --> 05:23.944
So before landing,

05:24.082 --> 05:26.533
a full inspection of
the XJ2 must be completed

05:26.671 --> 05:29.329
according to Section
267, Subsection 45.

05:29.467 --> 05:30.330
Question.

05:31.779 --> 05:33.194
No.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.576
Um, also, I've done
the liberty of preparing
your MLWs.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.406
What's an MLW?

05:37.544 --> 05:39.787
Oh my God, okay.
Mission log watch.

05:39.925 --> 05:41.237
Does it come with a
built-in alarm clock

05:41.375 --> 05:43.066
that doesn't float around?

05:43.204 --> 05:46.932
Does it come with a
human that enjoys robot urine?

05:48.624 --> 05:50.591
Can we stay
focused children, okay?

05:50.729 --> 05:52.041
We're about to
enter Earth's orbit,

05:52.179 --> 05:54.250
and that means we graduate,
complete the mission,

05:54.388 --> 05:55.389
become full-fledged Colonials,

05:55.527 --> 05:57.667
and you are not screwing
it up up for me.

05:57.805 --> 06:01.361
I've taken the liberty
of developing a weapon

06:01.499 --> 06:04.709
for the XJ2 that's made
of Martian element.

06:04.847 --> 06:05.848
- All right.
- Right?

06:05.986 --> 06:06.642
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:06.780 --> 06:07.919
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:08.057 --> 06:09.852
So that means she's
ready to go, right?

06:09.990 --> 06:12.993
- Ready to go.
- Inspection over!

06:21.691 --> 06:24.245
Does it have a cup holder?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.903
Yeah. The only thing
she's missing is a pilot.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.596
So our weapons,
um,

06:29.734 --> 06:33.634
they can, like, totally
eliminate Exile forces, right?

06:33.772 --> 06:36.603
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that, but obviously.

06:36.741 --> 06:38.087
Great.

06:38.225 --> 06:39.606
So besides the mission,
be careful where you-

06:40.848 --> 06:41.953
Whoa!

06:47.855 --> 06:49.512
What's going on?

06:49.650 --> 06:52.550
That, my friends, was
the shockwave of a solar flare.

06:52.688 --> 06:54.172
Before the ship
went offline,

06:54.310 --> 06:57.624
I tapped into the ship's
sensory system, and it turns out

06:57.762 --> 07:01.697
we just flew right into a
hidden EMP barrier of sorts.

07:05.286 --> 07:06.356
Let's get to the command room

07:06.495 --> 07:08.082
and figure out what's
actually going on.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.014
Silas?

07:10.809 --> 07:11.914
- Uh-
- Let's go.

07:12.052 --> 07:14.054
Everybody, just,
you know, stay calm.

07:14.192 --> 07:15.055
Let's not jump-

07:17.506 --> 07:20.750
That was not an EMP! That
was a ship attacking us!

07:30.933 --> 07:32.382
Is this thing ready to fly?

07:32.521 --> 07:33.832
Ready as it'll ever be.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.869
All right. I'm taking her out.

07:36.007 --> 07:38.630
Everyone, to your
stations! Pronto!

07:44.809 --> 07:45.844
Spark?

07:45.982 --> 07:47.156
Silas?

07:47.294 --> 07:48.744
We've got a love/hate
relationship, but I-

07:48.882 --> 07:51.091
Well, that
makes one of us.

08:03.793 --> 08:06.175
Bet you wish you
had a suit like this.

08:06.313 --> 08:09.454
Bet you wish you
hadn't shrunk your jacket.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.663
It looks like the EMP disabled

08:11.801 --> 08:12.906
most of our ship's controls.

08:13.044 --> 08:15.391
Ah! Our shields
are completely down!

08:15.529 --> 08:16.357
Yeah?

08:17.255 --> 08:18.774
Not only that, but,

08:18.912 --> 08:20.810
we have no control
to ship's trajectory.

08:20.948 --> 08:22.709
What are we gonna do
about the rogue ship?

08:22.847 --> 08:24.193
The only thing we can do.

08:25.781 --> 08:27.714
We have to send Silas
out to intercept.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.910
Help! Help!

08:52.048 --> 08:53.153
We just got hit again!

08:53.291 --> 08:54.844
Yeah, they just hit
the starboard side.

08:54.982 --> 08:56.156
That's where Silas is.

08:56.294 --> 08:57.606
Silas!

08:57.744 --> 08:58.710
Silas!

08:58.848 --> 09:00.229
You good? You good?

09:00.367 --> 09:01.610
I can't stop spinning!

09:01.748 --> 09:04.613
This suit's about to
become a vomit comet!

09:04.751 --> 09:06.166
Can you make it to the XJ2?

09:06.304 --> 09:08.686
Uh, uh, I think so.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.071
Help!

09:15.209 --> 09:18.868
Whoa!

09:25.599 --> 09:26.945
Come on!

09:27.083 --> 09:29.120
What's wrong with this
junker? Nothing's working.

09:30.293 --> 09:32.054
Do you even
have your license?

09:34.574 --> 09:35.713
Come on!

09:35.851 --> 09:37.507
Did you type in
the authorization code?

09:42.478 --> 09:43.893
I think that EMP
might've done her in.

09:44.031 --> 09:46.171
Ah, there has to be some way

09:46.309 --> 09:47.828
to spark this junker into life.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.488
Don't you even...

09:52.626 --> 09:54.490
Whoa! Whoa!

09:57.873 --> 09:59.253
Yes!

09:59.391 --> 10:00.600
If I knew you
were gonna make that move...

10:02.015 --> 10:03.154
We are in

10:05.052 --> 10:06.226
business, baby!

10:23.381 --> 10:24.900
I told you she was
state of the art.

10:25.038 --> 10:27.627
Uh, I hate to crash
your party, but, uh,

10:27.765 --> 10:29.939
we're about to enter
Earth's gravitational pull.

10:31.182 --> 10:32.804
Once we enter there,
there's no escaping.

10:52.755 --> 10:55.378
Uh, should we jump
in with Silas?

10:55.516 --> 10:56.310
Jess?

10:58.209 --> 11:00.970
Jess? Should we
jump in with Silas?

11:02.731 --> 11:05.078
I think we're out of time.

13:38.783 --> 13:40.509
You're alive. Darn.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.962
You!

13:45.100 --> 13:48.068
Did you hit me with
that, that ship?

13:49.380 --> 13:50.277
What?

13:50.415 --> 13:51.278
Huh?

13:52.728 --> 13:54.868
What's going on
down there, Zoe?

13:55.006 --> 13:57.595
Well, he's not
dead, unfortunately.

13:59.942 --> 14:00.667
Who's not dead?

14:01.668 --> 14:03.221
Who are you talking to? Huh?

14:04.878 --> 14:05.845
Who is he?

14:07.398 --> 14:08.399
Is he an Exile?

14:09.296 --> 14:10.159
Doubtful?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.060
Are you sniffing dirt?

14:14.198 --> 14:16.338
You don't
think he's a...

14:16.476 --> 14:18.098
Don't say it.

14:18.236 --> 14:19.720
Colonial?

14:21.826 --> 14:23.517
No, there's no
way this little twerp

14:23.655 --> 14:24.691
could be one of them.

14:26.106 --> 14:27.625
One of who?

14:27.763 --> 14:29.109
What's your name, soldier?

14:29.247 --> 14:30.041
Uh...

14:31.801 --> 14:32.906
I, uh...

14:34.908 --> 14:35.805
I don't know.

14:37.255 --> 14:39.913
Well, usually soldiers' names
are written on the dog tag.

14:48.404 --> 14:49.509
Silas?

14:49.647 --> 14:51.925
Good. Glad you
figured out your name.

14:52.063 --> 14:53.789
Now, do you even know
where you're at?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.239
I'm sure you can tell me.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.938
I want you to listen
closely, all right?

15:07.147 --> 15:09.701
You see that smoke coming
off your ship there? Hmm?

15:11.289 --> 15:12.635
That can be seen for miles.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.709
Zoey, we might
have company coming.

15:17.847 --> 15:19.228
Can you wrap it up down there?

15:20.160 --> 15:20.989
What do you see?

15:28.444 --> 15:31.585
It's an Exile drone.
Get out of there now!

15:31.723 --> 15:33.415
Copy that. We'll leave now.

15:33.553 --> 15:35.624
You better
make it back, Zoey.

15:36.487 --> 15:37.315
Hey!

15:38.178 --> 15:39.628
Where are you going?

15:48.775 --> 15:50.397
Hey, where are you going?

15:52.261 --> 15:54.436
They're coming. We need
to get outta here quickly.

15:54.574 --> 15:55.437
Who is they?

15:55.575 --> 15:57.163
The Exiles. You wanna live?

15:57.301 --> 15:59.199
I suggest you come with me.
What, come with you?

15:59.337 --> 16:01.684
The one who threw
water over my face?

16:15.975 --> 16:16.803
Get in!

16:29.609 --> 16:31.611
I'm going as fast as I can.

16:31.749 --> 16:33.647
Man, I hate this thing.

16:41.448 --> 16:43.899
Do you even know how
to fly this POSJ?

16:44.037 --> 16:44.831
POSJ?

16:44.969 --> 16:46.936
Yeah, piece of space junk.

17:16.276 --> 17:19.072
I'm fine,
you're, fine, we're fine.

17:19.210 --> 17:21.419
Will you be quiet?

17:45.478 --> 17:47.721
Hold on, spaceman!

18:07.086 --> 18:10.537
Hold on! We're getting
of the main road!

18:19.305 --> 18:24.275
No, no, no! This
isn't working!

18:27.140 --> 18:28.279
That's a wall.

18:32.801 --> 18:33.629
Wall!!!

18:39.428 --> 18:42.673
Know how to use one
of these, soldier?

18:42.811 --> 18:44.468
You're a soldier, right?

18:44.606 --> 18:45.434
Yeah.

18:46.470 --> 18:47.367
Yeah, sure.

18:48.748 --> 18:49.921
Die!

18:50.059 --> 18:51.130
Die!

18:51.268 --> 18:52.096
Die!

18:56.411 --> 18:57.722
Die!

18:57.860 --> 18:59.379
Hey!

18:59.517 --> 19:00.691
Give me that.

19:07.111 --> 19:08.768
It wasn't that hard.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.884
Cyrus, this is absurd.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.266
We're the most advanced
civilization in the galaxy,

20:33.404 --> 20:36.407
and we can't even get a
signal through to our son.

20:36.545 --> 20:37.995
He may be in danger.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.480
Let's not jump to
conclusions, honey.

20:40.618 --> 20:41.895
I'm sure Silas is fine.

20:42.033 --> 20:42.931
You don't know that.

20:43.069 --> 20:43.863
I do know that.

20:44.933 --> 20:46.245
He is piloting the most

20:46.383 --> 20:48.350
technologically-advanced
ship in our fleet.

20:48.488 --> 20:51.698
Defense systems are,
they're impenetrable.

20:51.836 --> 20:54.045
There's no possible way
anything could happen to him.

20:54.183 --> 20:55.737
Besides, he's with
Allie and Jesse.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.773
Those two are the top
of their class.

20:57.911 --> 21:00.120
Who only graduated last week.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.570
Cyrus, are you even
listening to me?

21:01.708 --> 21:03.538
What would you
have me do, Kelli?

21:03.676 --> 21:05.194
Send someone after them.

21:07.507 --> 21:09.095
You're the commander-in-chief.
Do something.

21:09.233 --> 21:10.683
I can't do anything!

21:10.821 --> 21:13.237
Not without the committee's
approval.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.583
So?

21:14.721 --> 21:17.724
What, we just do nothing?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.869
What if the Exiles captured him?

21:31.048 --> 21:31.842
Honey,

21:34.672 --> 21:37.468
like humanity, we have no idea

21:37.606 --> 21:39.677
as to the whereabouts
of the Exiles.

21:39.815 --> 21:41.714
Now, that also means
that we have no reason

21:41.852 --> 21:43.647
to think that there's
an active threat.

21:43.785 --> 21:45.442
Cyrus, please.

21:48.168 --> 21:48.962
Please.

21:54.968 --> 21:56.315
I'll talk to the committee.

21:57.488 --> 21:58.282
Okay?

22:01.009 --> 22:02.976
Do you
really think he's okay?

22:04.840 --> 22:06.186
I wouldn't
have sent our son halfway

22:06.325 --> 22:08.741
across the galaxy if I
didn't think he was ready.

22:19.614 --> 22:21.926
Now you belong to my tribe.

22:31.073 --> 22:33.766
Yeah, all the bad spirits,

22:33.904 --> 22:35.319
gone, gone, gone.

22:36.285 --> 22:41.256
Chase them away!

22:43.948 --> 22:44.880
Wait!

22:45.018 --> 22:48.815
Stay!

22:49.713 --> 22:51.749
Lets play dirt.

22:52.267 --> 22:53.095
Yeah!

22:54.442 --> 22:57.548
Grow, grow, grow.

22:57.686 --> 22:58.894
And over there.

23:00.171 --> 23:03.002
And a little bit on yourself.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.348
And share.

23:04.486 --> 23:05.349
Share, share.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.052
Grow, grow, grow.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.226
Hey! Come back!

23:22.262 --> 23:23.816
Hey, guys! Wait up!

23:25.300 --> 23:26.405
Wait for me.

23:26.543 --> 23:29.822
Oh! Oh!

23:29.960 --> 23:30.788
I'm sorry.

23:37.174 --> 23:38.347
Zoey!

23:38.486 --> 23:39.970
Zoey, wait for me!

23:41.627 --> 23:44.077
Bam. For something
so primitive, it sure hauls
asteroid.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.493
I need you to behave.

23:45.631 --> 23:47.736
You're about to meet the leader
of the Resistance.

24:13.797 --> 24:17.145
General. Nice to
finally meet you.

24:17.283 --> 24:18.111
Hey!

24:19.665 --> 24:21.494
Who have you dragged
in this time, Zoey?

24:21.632 --> 24:23.185
General! General!

24:23.323 --> 24:27.776
You won't believe the fireball
this guy came riding in on.

24:27.914 --> 24:31.608
He must've been going mach 30
when he crashed into the city.

24:31.746 --> 24:35.301
We found him chilling half
dead against his ship,

24:35.439 --> 24:37.199
and Zoey's all like, "Oh,
we gotta go check him out."

24:37.337 --> 24:40.720
But I was like, "Nah, you
should proceed with caution."

24:40.858 --> 24:42.273
You know?
Thomas.

24:42.411 --> 24:46.243
But then this drone came and
started shooting nukes at us.

24:46.381 --> 24:47.520
- Thomas!
- But did I say

24:47.658 --> 24:49.039
you came from the sky?

24:49.177 --> 24:51.697
I knew they'd come
back. I knew it.

24:51.835 --> 24:53.802
I'm sure your story holds
truth, on the truth, Thomas.

24:53.940 --> 24:54.734
Who?

24:54.872 --> 24:56.356
Who exactly is

24:56.495 --> 24:57.599
"they?"

24:57.737 --> 24:58.566
Don't say
it. Don't say it.

24:59.567 --> 25:01.085
Colonials. Hello.

25:02.052 --> 25:03.502
Colonials?

25:03.640 --> 25:06.815
Seems as though that crash
has jogged his memory, General.

25:06.953 --> 25:10.336
You don't need that mask
in here, Zoey. Take it off.

25:10.474 --> 25:13.063
Now, I'm glad you all
made it back here safely,

25:13.201 --> 25:16.031
but now we need to get to
the bottom of this situation.

25:17.688 --> 25:20.242
That Exile drone
came in very quickly.

25:20.380 --> 25:23.349
They must've wanted to recover
whatever crashed there.

25:23.487 --> 25:26.317
You. Hey, I'm talking to you.

25:26.455 --> 25:27.560
General.

25:27.698 --> 25:29.251
What happened
before the crash?

25:30.356 --> 25:31.668
Honestly, I, uh,

25:34.947 --> 25:36.396
I couldn't tell you.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.881
He couldn't even
tell me his own name,

25:38.019 --> 25:39.676
if it hadn't been
for that dog tag.

25:39.814 --> 25:42.023
He's a Colonial. It's obvious.

25:42.161 --> 25:43.749
So what is your name?

25:44.612 --> 25:45.474
Uh...

25:47.580 --> 25:48.408
Silas.

25:49.824 --> 25:52.792
Did we recover any
intel from his ship, Zoey?

25:52.930 --> 25:56.140
No, unfortunately not.
We didn't have enough time.

25:56.278 --> 25:59.316
The only thing we
recovered was Silas.

25:59.454 --> 26:02.284
Ma'am, I received news
on the crashed vessel.

26:05.805 --> 26:07.289
All right, listen up.

26:08.497 --> 26:09.809
Resistance scouts are reporting

26:09.947 --> 26:12.087
that your ship was
taken to this quadrant.

26:13.744 --> 26:15.435
Now, we don't know
what they want.

26:16.920 --> 26:20.924
Zoey, Thomas, I want you to
infiltrate the Exile base

26:21.062 --> 26:22.408
and recover that ship.

26:22.546 --> 26:24.237
And this must be
done under the radar.

26:24.375 --> 26:27.309
That means leaving that
noisy vehicle if yours behind

26:27.447 --> 26:29.070
and going in on foot.

26:29.208 --> 26:30.554
But we can't.

26:30.692 --> 26:34.869
But even if we get past
the guards and reach the ship,

26:35.007 --> 26:36.871
how do we fly back?

26:37.009 --> 26:39.598
That's precisely why
I'm having you take Silas.

26:39.736 --> 26:42.670
Hopefully, being near that
ship will jog his memory.

26:42.808 --> 26:45.949
Hopefully? Good,
good.

26:46.087 --> 26:47.329
You want us to risk our lives

26:47.467 --> 26:49.366
for this random guy we just met?

26:49.504 --> 26:50.678
Zoey,

26:50.816 --> 26:53.370
every day we don't act,

26:53.508 --> 26:57.167
more humans are forced
into slavery, or worse.

26:57.305 --> 26:59.963
The ship could be the key
to everything.

27:01.965 --> 27:02.759
I understand.

27:04.933 --> 27:05.969
Let's go, Thomas.

27:07.729 --> 27:10.870
Yeah, just breeze
past the Exile guards

27:11.008 --> 27:13.148
and reach the ship that
nobody knows how to fly

27:13.286 --> 27:16.082
but the mindless alien that
doesn't even know his own name.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.049
Yeah, sure.

27:21.156 --> 27:23.193
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

27:23.331 --> 27:24.781
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

27:34.722 --> 27:36.585
There's someone I know
who may be able

27:36.724 --> 27:38.760
to help figure out
where you came from.

27:38.898 --> 27:42.212
However, we haven't had contact
with him for some time now.

27:42.350 --> 27:44.041
I'll try anything
at this point.

27:45.767 --> 27:46.975
His name is Zeke.

27:47.113 --> 27:48.770
He used to play a major
role in the Resistance,

27:48.908 --> 27:50.910
but he dropped out of society,

27:51.048 --> 27:53.913
and he's taken steps
to keep it that way.

27:54.051 --> 27:55.639
Where can I find this Zeke?

27:56.985 --> 27:58.884
The last known location
of his residence.

28:00.126 --> 28:02.059
The man is very
dangerous, Silas.

28:02.197 --> 28:03.854
Who's to save if he
even still thinks

28:03.992 --> 28:05.442
of the Resistance as an ally?

28:07.651 --> 28:08.687
Thank you, General.

28:09.929 --> 28:11.310
What about Thomas and Zoey?

28:12.829 --> 28:15.348
Think of this as a reward
for completing your task.

28:15.486 --> 28:19.801
Once you've covered your ship,
feel free to seek him out.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.889
You, come here.

28:39.027 --> 28:40.649
Yes, you.

28:40.788 --> 28:42.721
Come here, quick!

28:42.859 --> 28:43.687
Come here!

30:15.020 --> 30:18.540
Raven, what
have you uncovered?

30:18.678 --> 30:21.854
The technology is of
Colonial design, as I presumed.

30:21.992 --> 30:23.511
Yes.

30:23.649 --> 30:24.892
Excellent.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.445
What else?

30:26.583 --> 30:27.895
According to the bot's
data log,

30:28.033 --> 30:31.968
the ship belongs to a
Colonial named Silas.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.181
That's not
just any Colonial.

30:38.319 --> 30:40.942
That's Silas, son of Cyrus,

30:41.080 --> 30:43.048
commander of the Colonial
forces.

30:43.186 --> 30:45.050
Yes. What would
you have me do?

30:45.188 --> 30:48.536
Go to Section
45 and await my commands.

30:48.674 --> 30:52.643
I'm sending Lockjaw and
Flatline to help assist.

30:53.541 --> 30:54.645
- And the droid?
- Leave it.

30:54.783 --> 30:57.062
You have what you
need already. Now go.

30:58.339 --> 30:59.788
As you command.

30:59.927 --> 31:03.585
And bring me
that Colonial.

31:52.186 --> 31:53.773
So what's up with Zoey?

31:53.912 --> 31:54.809
What do you mean?

31:55.914 --> 31:57.122
Like, from the start,

31:57.260 --> 31:59.365
she's treated me
like a pile of dirt.

31:59.503 --> 32:02.713
I mean, it's not
you necessarily.

32:02.851 --> 32:06.545
It's kind of just how we were
raised with the Resistance.

32:06.683 --> 32:08.064
So what about you?

32:08.202 --> 32:10.721
I mean, like,
why did she tolerate you?

32:10.859 --> 32:12.413
Are you two like...

32:12.551 --> 32:14.622
No. No!

32:14.760 --> 32:16.141
It's not like that.

32:16.279 --> 32:18.937
We're basically brother
and sister at this point.

32:19.075 --> 32:20.145
Could've fooled me, I mean,

32:20.283 --> 32:22.147
your personalities
are vastly different.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.564
I'd ask you a
question, but, uh...

32:29.154 --> 32:31.121
I hope it comes
back to me eventually.

32:33.365 --> 32:35.539
Aren't you a little young to
be venturing off on your own?

32:35.677 --> 32:38.266
I mean, where are your parents?

32:39.785 --> 32:43.064
Well, we both kind of think
of Rhea as our parent figure.

32:44.686 --> 32:47.931
Zoey and I, our parents
both were sold into slavery

32:48.069 --> 32:50.830
by the Exiles when
we were really young.

32:50.969 --> 32:54.696
I don't know where they are or
if they're even still alive.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.908
Like, I don't even know
who my parents are,

33:00.047 --> 33:02.014
if that makes you
feel any better.

33:02.152 --> 33:04.051
It is what it is.

33:04.189 --> 33:05.569
Even then, I-

33:05.707 --> 33:08.158
Hey, what are you two
wingnuts blabbering about?

33:08.296 --> 33:09.780
Uh, nothing.

33:11.127 --> 33:12.818
Actually, Thomas
was just telling me

33:12.956 --> 33:14.820
about your embarrassing
ex-boyfriends.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.754
Oh, is that so?

33:18.893 --> 33:20.205
I'll tell you
what's embarrassing.

33:20.343 --> 33:22.862
Watching you trying to
shoot down that Exile drone.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.658
Well, uh, you know,
Silas was telling me

33:25.796 --> 33:28.282
how he much preferred
you without your mask on.

33:29.283 --> 33:30.422
Oh.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.940
No.

33:32.079 --> 33:34.115
No, I mean, you
removed your mask,

33:34.253 --> 33:36.255
and you had, like,
she had dirt, okay?

33:36.393 --> 33:38.154
You had a lot of dirt
all over your face,

33:38.292 --> 33:40.328
and I was like, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:40.466 --> 33:43.331
Are you sure you weren't worried
about the dirt on my face?

33:43.469 --> 33:44.953
Speaking of dirt, um,

33:45.092 --> 33:48.233
did you guys see the crazy,
guy, like playing in the dirt?

33:48.371 --> 33:50.442
Yeah, that guy got me
with his voodoo games, too.

33:50.580 --> 33:53.686
Yeah, I couldn't move. Like,
he kept me there for hours.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.171
Jokes aside now, guys.

33:56.724 --> 34:00.900
This mission is extremely
crucial to the Resistance.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.419
Now, if it were up to me,

34:02.557 --> 34:03.662
I'd be in and out of that
base before you could blink,

34:03.800 --> 34:05.595
but I don't know how
to fly that ship.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.976
Yeah? Well, what makes
you think I know how?

34:09.668 --> 34:12.222
Hey, don't ask
me. That's on Rhea.

34:13.361 --> 34:15.467
I mean, you're
obviously inexperienced.

34:15.605 --> 34:17.641
You don't even know
how to fire a weapon.

34:19.298 --> 34:22.336
You're just a nobody that's
gonna end up getting us killed.

34:22.474 --> 34:23.302
Come on, Zoe.

34:24.303 --> 34:26.685
No, No, this isn't a joke.

34:26.823 --> 34:28.411
The Exiles will kill us
the first chance they get,

34:28.549 --> 34:31.448
and we don't need this
anchor holding us down.

34:37.454 --> 34:38.283
I'm going to bed.

34:40.699 --> 34:43.771
Um, I'm sorry about that, man.

34:45.428 --> 34:47.602
But hey, you know,
maybe she's right.

34:47.740 --> 34:51.330
We've got a busy day tomorrow.
Let's get some rest, yeah?

35:21.740 --> 35:22.534
Silas!

35:24.018 --> 35:24.881
No!

36:24.906 --> 36:25.700
He's gone.

36:26.598 --> 36:28.324
We can't find Silas anywhere.

36:28.462 --> 36:30.533
He must have left last night.
What are we gonna do now?

36:30.671 --> 36:31.292
Let him go.

36:31.430 --> 36:32.431
Let him go?

36:32.569 --> 36:33.812
He's a freaking pilot.

36:33.950 --> 36:35.054
Colonials wouldn't
have changed

36:35.193 --> 36:36.815
their ship controls
too drastically.

36:36.953 --> 36:41.164
And if anyone can figure out
to fly their ship, it's you.

36:41.302 --> 36:42.717
She's right.

36:42.855 --> 36:44.685
Weren't you just complaining
about how he was a risk anyway?

36:44.823 --> 36:47.515
Hey, we're out of
options and time.

36:47.653 --> 36:50.104
I need you both to
get moving, now. Go.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.933
No communication
has been received

37:26.071 --> 37:28.211
from the Delta One in days.

37:28.349 --> 37:31.145
We need to send another
ship immediately

37:31.283 --> 37:32.767
and investigate what happened.

37:32.905 --> 37:34.044
Oh, that's outrageous!

37:34.182 --> 37:35.183
You
already convinced us

37:35.322 --> 37:37.151
to send one ship on
this goose chase,

37:37.289 --> 37:38.635
but why would we send another?

37:38.773 --> 37:40.119
Not to
mention, we don't even know

37:40.258 --> 37:43.433
if there's anything wrong with
Delta Squad to begin with.

37:43.571 --> 37:45.401
They're
no more than greedy viruses

37:45.539 --> 37:47.403
consuming everything
in their path.

37:47.541 --> 37:49.577
Turning our back
on those less fortunate?

37:49.715 --> 37:51.924
Have you forgotten
from where you came?

37:52.062 --> 37:54.686
The Earthlings are
committed to the Exiles now.

37:54.824 --> 37:55.963
Breaking communication with us

37:56.101 --> 37:57.965
just confirms where
their loyalty lies.

37:59.207 --> 38:01.624
And let them revert
back to the dark ages?

38:01.762 --> 38:04.972
There are humans
that need our help.

38:05.110 --> 38:08.976
We cannot afford to put any
more Colonial lives in danger.

38:09.114 --> 38:10.391
I will not put
up with this any longer!

38:10.529 --> 38:11.944
Order!

38:12.082 --> 38:14.257
Order, I say! Order!

38:15.085 --> 38:16.432
Yes,

38:16.570 --> 38:18.123
it is true

38:18.261 --> 38:20.781
that we funded this mission

38:20.919 --> 38:23.680
and gave it our
precious resources.

38:23.818 --> 38:26.062
But I want all of this
committee to remember

38:26.200 --> 38:29.030
that the mission was voluntary,

38:30.342 --> 38:32.137
and one of the brave soldiers

38:33.172 --> 38:35.554
who volunteered so valiantly

38:36.521 --> 38:38.316
was Cyrus's own son.

38:39.834 --> 38:43.459
Now, I do not assume that
any member of this senate

38:43.597 --> 38:46.324
is going to jump
at the opportunity

38:46.462 --> 38:50.155
to send one of your own family
members into this situation.

38:50.293 --> 38:53.503
So I say we listen to Cyrus,

38:53.641 --> 38:56.989
because Cyrus has given
more to this mission

38:57.127 --> 38:58.922
than any of you,

38:59.060 --> 39:00.096
and he must be heard.

39:04.721 --> 39:08.691
All right, we understand
what needs to be discussed.

39:08.829 --> 39:12.626
Cyrus, we'll congregate.
We'll discuss the matter.

39:12.764 --> 39:15.974
Tomorrow we'll have
an answer. Until then.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.331
Hey!

41:18.752 --> 41:19.511
Hey!

41:29.625 --> 41:30.833
Hey, you there!

41:35.562 --> 41:36.424
Hey!

42:12.081 --> 42:12.909
Hey!

42:17.086 --> 42:17.914
Hey!

42:35.691 --> 42:36.484
Sorry!

42:38.590 --> 42:39.418
I'm sorry!

42:40.868 --> 42:41.628
No! No!

42:41.766 --> 42:42.560
No! No!

42:48.117 --> 42:49.567
Where do you come from, boy?

42:49.705 --> 42:50.498
Uh,

42:52.673 --> 42:53.467
the sky.

42:54.606 --> 42:55.400
I think.

42:59.404 --> 43:00.854
You know how to play charades?

43:10.449 --> 43:12.244
I lost my hearing
in the old war.

43:13.314 --> 43:15.040
Well, most of it, anyway.

43:15.178 --> 43:18.975
It wasn't so bad when I had my
late wife Elizabeth with me.

43:19.113 --> 43:20.459
I'll tell
you, I'll tell you,

43:20.598 --> 43:22.772
that woman, she could talk
an elephant's ear off.

43:22.910 --> 43:23.980
Like a record player,

43:24.118 --> 43:27.708
just going around and
around and around.

43:28.882 --> 43:30.469
I miss her.

43:31.539 --> 43:32.748
I pictured you
being more of a-

43:32.886 --> 43:34.197
You know, now it's
just me and Morgan,

43:34.335 --> 43:35.785
and he don't say much.

43:37.304 --> 43:38.132
Wait.

43:39.168 --> 43:40.203
Morgan?
I can't hear you.

43:40.341 --> 43:41.066
Morgan?

43:41.204 --> 43:42.585
I can't hear you,

43:42.723 --> 43:44.138
and I don't go in for that
sign language crap, either.

43:44.276 --> 43:47.659
Not with these sausages. Come
on, look at 'em.

43:47.797 --> 43:48.764
- Wow!
- Hey!

43:50.041 --> 43:50.869
You see something
that looks like

43:51.007 --> 43:52.733
it doesn't come from this world,

43:52.871 --> 43:55.494
do yourself a favor and
don't touch it, got it?

43:58.359 --> 44:00.396
I lost my arm during the war

44:00.534 --> 44:03.295
protecting the humans
against those Exiles.

44:03.433 --> 44:04.987
- Exiles?
- I'll never forget the witch

44:05.125 --> 44:06.954
who took my arm, cut it off.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.509
Well, get your pen and
paper. Let's get to it.

44:11.994 --> 44:13.133
Uh...

44:13.271 --> 44:14.375
Oh.

44:14.513 --> 44:15.342
Okay.

44:20.727 --> 44:21.589
So your

44:22.729 --> 44:23.591
hand?

44:25.145 --> 44:26.318
It got taken.

44:28.320 --> 44:29.149
Yeah.

44:30.184 --> 44:31.013
Uh...

44:32.428 --> 44:33.222
Who

44:34.188 --> 44:35.500
took it?

44:35.638 --> 44:36.984
I know you can't
remember anything,

44:37.122 --> 44:39.124
but are you sure
you're not a professor?

44:39.262 --> 44:40.470
Professor?

44:40.608 --> 44:42.990
Yeah, 'cause you got a
PhD in busted my balls.

44:45.096 --> 44:48.340
She was an assassin. Did
all Grom's dirty work.

44:50.584 --> 44:52.275
- Grom?
- Don't you know anything?

44:52.413 --> 44:54.381
The Exiles, Silas.

44:54.519 --> 44:56.383
The Exiles, they
are led by Grom.

44:56.521 --> 44:58.730
He is a very
dangerous individual.

44:59.904 --> 45:02.216
He used to also be a
very powerful Colonial,

45:03.321 --> 45:04.702
and he used to be my friend.

45:05.910 --> 45:08.533
Look, Silas, there was
a time when humans,

45:08.671 --> 45:12.330
they thrived during
the Space Age,

45:12.468 --> 45:14.781
and the best of the best,
the elite,

45:14.919 --> 45:16.644
they became known
as the Colonials.

45:18.370 --> 45:19.786
But they couldn't,

45:19.924 --> 45:21.097
they couldn't handle
the technology, some of them,

45:21.235 --> 45:23.790
and, well, they got
engulfed in greed.

45:24.963 --> 45:27.379
eventually they were
cast out of the colony.

45:27.517 --> 45:30.279
They were banished like
Lucifer from Heaven.

45:30.417 --> 45:32.177
And they became
known as the Exiles.

45:36.009 --> 45:39.357
What happened to the, um,

45:39.495 --> 45:40.289
Exiles?

45:41.359 --> 45:42.429
With nowhere else to go,

45:42.567 --> 45:44.120
they made the long
voyage back to Earth.

45:46.157 --> 45:48.642
And when they got there,
they took their new power

45:49.608 --> 45:51.403
and they waged war on mankind.

45:52.922 --> 45:54.130
It was decided by the Colonials

45:54.268 --> 45:55.960
that we would send
a small force,

45:57.133 --> 45:58.894
myself included, were
sent to intervene.

46:00.550 --> 46:03.588
When we got there, we were
pushed back almost immediately.

46:03.726 --> 46:07.281
No choices, no options.
I was left behind.

46:08.731 --> 46:11.320
So now you know why I'm
here. But why are you here?

46:13.598 --> 46:14.841
Well, I, um,

46:17.188 --> 46:18.361
I was, uh,

46:19.777 --> 46:21.019
here by Rhea.

46:23.021 --> 46:24.851
Rhea.

46:24.989 --> 46:27.025
Yeah, there's a name
I haven't thought about

46:27.163 --> 46:28.371
in a very long time.

46:28.509 --> 46:29.683
- Yeah?
- She's a special one,

46:29.821 --> 46:31.202
ain't she?

46:31.340 --> 46:32.790
But why did she send you here?

46:34.170 --> 46:35.240
Well, I, um,

46:35.378 --> 46:37.518
I crash...

46:40.073 --> 46:41.799
I crash landed on Earth.

46:44.594 --> 46:47.390
What happened or who...

46:51.705 --> 46:54.052
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

46:55.502 --> 46:59.368
that dog tag you wearing,
that doesn't come from Earth.

46:59.506 --> 47:01.542
I'll tell you what,

47:01.680 --> 47:04.960
you showed me yours
so I'll show you mine.

47:05.098 --> 47:08.308
Lookie-lookie. I got
one just like you.

47:08.446 --> 47:09.619
You serious?

47:09.757 --> 47:11.345
Yeah.

47:11.483 --> 47:15.315
So I'm a spaceman sitting
with another spaceman,

47:15.453 --> 47:18.214
just sipping tea in
the middle of, um...

47:19.733 --> 47:20.665
Uh...

47:21.562 --> 47:22.425
How long

47:23.323 --> 47:24.151
have you

47:25.014 --> 47:26.498
been here?

47:26.636 --> 47:28.086
Well, about 60 years.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.193
60 years?

47:32.677 --> 47:33.851
How did that happen?

47:35.611 --> 47:36.646
How old are you?

47:38.200 --> 47:39.373
Ah.

47:39.511 --> 47:42.031
Well, come the next,

47:42.169 --> 47:45.241
come the next winter solstice,
I'll be 127 years old.

47:45.379 --> 47:48.313
I've still got some lead
left in my pencil, too.

47:48.451 --> 47:53.284
You, me, Morgan,
we're all Colonials.

47:55.113 --> 47:55.907
Wait.

47:57.598 --> 47:58.945
We're Colonials?

47:59.946 --> 48:00.774
Mm-hmm.

48:05.572 --> 48:06.849
Where's, where's Morgan?

48:06.987 --> 48:07.712
Morgan. Morgan!

48:07.850 --> 48:09.024
- Morgan!
- You know what?

48:09.162 --> 48:10.232
I think you waited
long enough, too.

48:10.370 --> 48:11.647
I think it's about
to have you meet him.

48:11.785 --> 48:14.719
Hey, Morgan! I got someone
I want you to meet!

48:14.857 --> 48:16.963
Ah, stay right there.
Stay right there.

48:17.101 --> 48:19.620
Morgan, I'm coming!

48:19.758 --> 48:20.587
Morgan!

48:21.968 --> 48:22.830
Where are you?

48:24.625 --> 48:25.833
Silas?
Yeah?

48:25.972 --> 48:27.352
I want you to meet Morgan.

48:28.940 --> 48:29.768
Yeah.

48:29.907 --> 48:32.116
Morgan, this here is Silas.

48:33.565 --> 48:36.430
Yeah. Like I said,
he don't say much.

48:36.568 --> 48:38.639
What's the matter, Morgan?
Cat got your tongue?

48:38.777 --> 48:42.160
Yeah. He's a good boy.

48:42.298 --> 48:43.368
That's Silas.

48:54.621 --> 48:56.692
Oh, get down. Get down.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.804
Yup, we're gonna die.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.875
We've been in this
situation before.

49:08.014 --> 49:12.018
Okay. This place
is oozing with Exiles, Zoe.

49:12.156 --> 49:14.261
How do you even propose
we get to the ship?

49:40.494 --> 49:41.323
Rock.

49:41.461 --> 49:42.945
The rock. Rock.

49:43.083 --> 49:44.671
The rock. Come on.

49:44.809 --> 49:46.293
Come on. Hurry up.

49:55.578 --> 49:57.270
Huh?

50:00.514 --> 50:01.308
Come on.

50:15.184 --> 50:15.978
Whoa!

50:17.152 --> 50:20.051
How did you
get here? Stop them.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.438
All right, you draw
the ax above your head,

50:27.576 --> 50:30.786
you focus on your target,
nothing but the target,

50:30.924 --> 50:32.788
and then you strike
without thought.

50:38.518 --> 50:39.657
There you go!

50:39.795 --> 50:40.692
Ha-ha!

50:40.830 --> 50:41.935
Yeah, just might have a chance

50:42.073 --> 50:43.488
of getting up this
planet after all.

50:46.008 --> 50:48.355
What's going on?

50:48.493 --> 50:50.771
- Uh...
- Well, go. It's a desert.

50:57.123 --> 50:58.710
I mean, go anywhere.

50:59.573 --> 51:00.298
I do.

51:13.829 --> 51:15.210
Zeke!

51:37.991 --> 51:39.096
Raven!

52:31.044 --> 52:34.220
Morgan, how about a
little bit of help?

52:37.361 --> 52:40.018
All right, fine,
I'll do it myself.

52:43.470 --> 52:44.575
Kill him!

53:10.773 --> 53:12.430
What? Come on now.

53:16.193 --> 53:17.401
Zeke!

53:28.343 --> 53:29.792
Did you see that, Morgan?

53:29.930 --> 53:31.932
Yeah, just like we practiced.

54:35.341 --> 54:37.377
Huh? Hm

54:54.981 --> 54:56.983
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

54:57.121 --> 54:58.709
Did you see what's going on
out there? They have an army.

54:58.847 --> 55:00.780
They have fighter
ships. They have robots.

55:00.918 --> 55:02.437
Shh! Be quiet!

55:02.575 --> 55:05.612
Shh!

55:10.237 --> 55:11.894
- Just-
- Behind you! Behind you!

55:22.319 --> 55:23.285
Let's go.

55:34.296 --> 55:38.127
Zoey, we need to
get out of Mordor now.

55:38.265 --> 55:43.270
I'm working on it, man. My
adrenaline is off the charts.

55:45.169 --> 55:47.378
Hey, hey, isn't it
the robot from earlier?

55:51.348 --> 55:52.797
Let's follow him. Come on.

56:02.048 --> 56:03.877
Are you serious?

56:04.015 --> 56:05.914
What is going on with
that wonder ball?

56:15.095 --> 56:17.546
Look. He's stealing that ship.

56:36.841 --> 56:41.812
Hey, look. That
door is still open.

56:42.571 --> 56:42.951
Come on, let's go.

57:09.736 --> 57:13.119
Sure
would like to see R2-D2

57:13.257 --> 57:15.017
pull something off like that.

57:16.502 --> 57:20.575
Uh, something doesn't
seem right with my circuits.

57:20.713 --> 57:24.406
Feels like someone
or something's tampered
with my body.

57:26.581 --> 57:30.757
Did you see that? He just
murdered half an army, murdered!

57:30.895 --> 57:33.622
Why would we get on this
ship with this maniac robot?

57:33.760 --> 57:36.245
Thomas, look at me, okay?
I need you to calm down.

57:37.730 --> 57:40.353
He doesn't even have arms.
How is he flying the ship?

57:40.491 --> 57:42.148
He's obviously
not with the Exiles,

57:42.286 --> 57:44.495
since he just massacred them.

57:44.633 --> 57:47.912
Yeah, but what's stopping
him from massacring us?

57:48.050 --> 57:50.225
We can't stay here forever.

57:50.363 --> 57:51.882
We need to go talk to him.

57:52.952 --> 57:54.229
Huh-uh-nu-nu-nu-no

57:54.367 --> 57:55.057
Shh!

57:55.195 --> 57:57.094
We need to do something.

57:58.267 --> 58:00.269
No, I do not
wanna go over there.

58:02.513 --> 58:04.342
The option is
to go talk to him,

58:04.481 --> 58:06.275
unless you wanna
jump off the ship.

58:08.761 --> 58:10.141
Okay. Fine.

58:10.279 --> 58:13.662
Huh, I wonder what
happened to that doofus Silas?

58:13.800 --> 58:16.423
I swear, if he's
gotten himself killed,

58:16.562 --> 58:20.013
Cyrus will have me formatted.

58:21.394 --> 58:22.429
Who's there?

58:25.502 --> 58:27.124
Eh, probably another space rat.

58:29.436 --> 58:31.715
Did you see that?

58:31.853 --> 58:35.063
I can't do this, Zoe.
That is a devil bot.

58:36.167 --> 58:36.996
Let's go.

58:39.377 --> 58:40.171
Hey, robot.

58:43.761 --> 58:45.211
How did
you kids get in here?

58:45.349 --> 58:46.764
Zoey. It was her fault.

58:46.902 --> 58:50.630
We saw you take out that
Exile army, and your ship,

58:50.768 --> 58:53.806
it was our only chance of
escape, so we hopped on.

58:53.944 --> 58:55.601
We're sorry. We're sorry.

58:55.739 --> 58:58.776
I don't even know how
or why I was at that base,

58:58.914 --> 59:01.261
but I'd never forget
what an Exile looks like.

59:01.399 --> 59:04.264
We saw you in a
room, taken apart.

59:05.783 --> 59:08.268
Could explain why I have no
recollection after the crash.

59:08.406 --> 59:09.442
You

59:09.580 --> 59:10.685
were on

59:10.823 --> 59:12.756
this ship when it crashed?

59:12.894 --> 59:15.759
I was designed by
Colonial engineers on Mars

59:15.897 --> 59:18.313
to serve with
the Delta One Regiment.

59:18.451 --> 59:20.073
I knew it!

59:20.211 --> 59:21.592
I told you

59:21.730 --> 59:23.042
that Silas

59:23.180 --> 59:23.974
is a

59:24.112 --> 59:25.769
Colonial.

59:26.770 --> 59:27.840
Yes, Silas.

59:27.978 --> 59:29.945
Do you know where he is?

59:32.534 --> 59:34.916
I think there's someone
you need to meet.

59:45.892 --> 59:48.101
Cyrus, can I talk to you?

59:49.620 --> 59:51.622
Now look, I know this must be
a very difficult time for you,

59:51.760 --> 59:52.934
but I just want you to know,

59:53.072 --> 59:55.522
I'm gonna do everything
in my power in there

59:55.661 --> 59:57.317
to find out what
happened to that mission.

59:57.455 --> 59:59.941
Thank you, Tobias.
I appreciate that.

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:02.599
Now look, I know
you were a soldier,

01:00:02.737 --> 01:00:05.705
and I know, whatever
the outcome, you're
gonna be all right.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.709
How's Kelli doing? I'm
sure this is hard on her.

01:00:11.228 --> 01:00:14.058
She's, um, she's strong.

01:00:15.542 --> 01:00:17.096
I think she blames me for this.

01:00:18.373 --> 01:00:21.307
Well, frankly, I don't
fault her for doing so.

01:00:21.445 --> 01:00:25.725
Cyrus, we all saw
the validity in the mission.

01:00:25.863 --> 01:00:27.209
You cannot blame yourself.

01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:30.212
I'll stop blaming myself
when we get them home safely.

01:00:33.837 --> 01:00:35.735
What do you think is
gonna happen in there?

01:00:41.258 --> 01:00:42.431
I don't know.

01:00:42.569 --> 01:00:43.778
I'll tell you, in the time

01:00:43.916 --> 01:00:45.400
that I've spent with
these pontificators,

01:00:45.538 --> 01:00:49.335
sometimes, just by accident,
they do the right thing.

01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:53.891
Now, I understand that
they all see the validity

01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:56.238
in the coexistence
with the humans,

01:00:56.376 --> 01:00:59.000
and I don't think any one of
them would stand in the way

01:00:59.138 --> 01:01:01.347
of you finding out what
happened to your son,

01:01:01.485 --> 01:01:02.866
but I just don't know.

01:01:04.488 --> 01:01:06.145
Well, one way to find out.

01:01:07.284 --> 01:01:09.044
Okay.

01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:25.647
On behalf of all
the representatives
of this committee,

01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:28.685
we've decided not to
aid the Delta One crew,

01:01:28.823 --> 01:01:30.617
nor the humans still
living on Earth.

01:01:32.274 --> 01:01:33.828
The risk is too great to send

01:01:33.966 --> 01:01:35.968
any more Colonials
into the unknown.

01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:44.839
They said no.

01:01:44.977 --> 01:01:47.048
- What?
- They said no.

01:01:47.186 --> 01:01:48.774
They denied the request.

01:01:48.912 --> 01:01:50.085
What would the Exiles
do to him

01:01:50.223 --> 01:01:52.605
when they get
their hands on him.

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.642
What will they do to him?

01:01:58.059 --> 01:01:59.232
Cyrus, Kelli, I'm
sorry to interrupt.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:01.476
Cyrus, you need to
come with me right now.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.880
Tell Rhea exactly what you
told us on the ship, bot.

01:02:26.018 --> 01:02:28.848
Shall we do this
the proper way? My name's Spark.

01:02:28.986 --> 01:02:30.332
I was built by the Colonials

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:32.196
for the purpose of serving Silas

01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:35.303
and assisting the Delta One
Regiment on this mission.

01:02:35.441 --> 01:02:38.616
What exactly is,
or was, your mission?

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.343
The Colonials haven't
received any communications

01:02:41.481 --> 01:02:43.656
from the humans on
Earth for 50 years.

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:45.416
Well, we could say
the same about you.

01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:46.624
Yeah, you're the ones
who cut off

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.488
all communications with us.

01:02:48.626 --> 01:02:50.249
Our mission
was to investigate

01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:53.424
what was causing
the interference and
report back to Cyrus.

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:54.909
Who is Cyrus.

01:02:55.047 --> 01:02:56.911
Well, you already
met Silas, apparently.

01:02:57.981 --> 01:02:59.948
Cyrus is his father,

01:03:00.086 --> 01:03:02.537
and also the leader of
the Colonial colony.

01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:04.850
Have you sent back
any distress signals?

01:03:04.988 --> 01:03:06.230
I've
made many attempts,

01:03:06.368 --> 01:03:08.232
but haven't received a response.

01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:24.870
I think I know what may
have happened to Silas.

01:03:26.526 --> 01:03:30.392
This weapon belonged to an
assassin known as Raven.

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:33.879
I believe she has something
to do with his disappearance.

01:03:34.017 --> 01:03:37.365
So we can assume
that Silas is dead?

01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:39.298
My fear is that the Exiles

01:03:39.436 --> 01:03:41.196
had figured out
exactly who Silas is.

01:03:42.439 --> 01:03:43.405
They've taken him
to a space station

01:03:43.543 --> 01:03:45.511
between Earth and the Moon.

01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:46.823
Why would they take him there?

01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:48.514
Because the space
station has always been

01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:51.206
out of our reach, until now.

01:04:03.943 --> 01:04:06.877
I told you, I don't know
anything about Colonials.

01:04:07.015 --> 01:04:08.534
Where are you taking me?

01:04:13.401 --> 01:04:15.196
Remove your clothes.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.508
No.

01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:24.343
No!

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:05.142
I figured a
Colonial would be much

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:07.558
larger.

01:05:11.424 --> 01:05:14.911
But here you are, no bigger
than the average human.

01:05:24.368 --> 01:05:27.026
I know everything about you
thanks to your little droid.

01:05:29.615 --> 01:05:32.169
You're gonna wish you never
came to Earth, Colonial.

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:51.257
Did you really
think you could come to Earth

01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:52.500
without us knowing?

01:05:53.811 --> 01:05:56.331
The stars shine upon
the Exiles today.

01:05:56.469 --> 01:05:58.540
The son of the great
Colonial leader

01:05:58.678 --> 01:06:00.404
is now in our possession.

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:02.889
A Colonial present
in this very station

01:06:03.028 --> 01:06:04.753
that powers our barrier.

01:06:04.891 --> 01:06:07.170
Nothing gets through our
electromagnetic barrier,

01:06:07.308 --> 01:06:12.209
and nothing gets out, as you
shall soon learn.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.387
You will suffer every
second of every day

01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:20.355
until your people give us
back what they've stolen.

01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:22.806
Silas,

01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:26.983
you hold the very thing I've
desired since the beginning,

01:06:27.121 --> 01:06:31.988
knowledge, knowledge that only
the Red Planet can produce.

01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:36.406
Colonials are bigger, stronger,

01:06:36.544 --> 01:06:37.924
ageless.

01:06:38.063 --> 01:06:40.720
That planet fuels
your evolution.

01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:46.761
Your mind is the gateway
to the revolution.

01:06:46.899 --> 01:06:50.868
However, we need to get back
those precious memories,

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:55.218
and this tank will do
exactly that.

01:06:58.704 --> 01:07:02.397
Once I finish off what
remains of the Resistance

01:07:02.535 --> 01:07:05.090
and take complete
control of Earth,

01:07:05.228 --> 01:07:08.231
I'll begin preparations
for the Mars campaign.

01:07:08.369 --> 01:07:11.751
The Colonials will be
at my mercy.

01:07:40.159 --> 01:07:42.679
Another mission with little
hope of coming out alive.

01:07:42.817 --> 01:07:46.269
I swear, Rhea doesn't
care what happens to us.

01:07:46.407 --> 01:07:47.753
Don't worry.

01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:50.238
I picked up a handful of rocks
just in case we need 'em.

01:07:50.376 --> 01:07:51.929
Wait, rocks? What?

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.690
You don't wanna know.
Trust me.

01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:07.669
I wonder if Silas
would but be happy to see me?

01:08:07.807 --> 01:08:09.015
No way to know.

01:08:09.154 --> 01:08:10.258
The last time we saw him,

01:08:10.396 --> 01:08:12.467
he couldn't even
remember his own name.

01:08:12.605 --> 01:08:15.608
Apparently that crash
removed his memories.

01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:19.060
Great. Maybe now
he'll start listening to me.

01:08:19.198 --> 01:08:20.510
Zoey! Thomas!

01:08:20.648 --> 01:08:23.996
There's a large Exile
force approaching rapidly.

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:26.032
We don't have the numbers
to counter their attack.

01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:29.415
Finish this as fast as
possible. We're outta time.

01:08:57.547 --> 01:08:59.065
You are
to return to Earth

01:08:59.204 --> 01:09:02.345
and rendezvous with
the rest of our forces.

01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:07.212
March for the Resistance base
at dawn. Eliminate them all.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.799
And Silas?

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:12.148
Let the chamber do
its work. He cannot escape.

01:09:13.079 --> 01:09:13.942
As you command.

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:46.561
What are
you doing, Zoey?

01:09:46.699 --> 01:09:49.115
Silas is on that space station.

01:09:49.254 --> 01:09:50.116
Oops!

01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:56.192
There's more fighters
coming out of that station!

01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:01.714
We're all gonna die!

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.654
Watch out!

01:11:30.907 --> 01:11:31.804
Shoot them!

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:46.060
Go! Go!

01:11:46.198 --> 01:11:46.888
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:11:47.026 --> 01:11:48.856
Shut up! I'm trying!

01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:52.998
If we keep this
up, we won't make it.

01:12:29.793 --> 01:12:32.900
This is
it! We're done for!

01:12:33.797 --> 01:12:34.626
Shut up!

01:12:36.075 --> 01:12:37.870
Guys? Hello?

01:12:40.459 --> 01:12:41.598
- Silas!
- Silas?

01:12:41.736 --> 01:12:43.531
You're alive!
I can't believe it!

01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:45.291
I'm not getting formatted!

01:12:48.053 --> 01:12:49.606
Uh, guys?

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.783
We may not have much
time. We need to hurry.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.768
I don't we know where I'm going.

01:13:13.906 --> 01:13:15.218
I need an exit plan!

01:13:16.115 --> 01:13:18.221
Out of the way, human.

01:13:18.359 --> 01:13:20.361
I'll handle this nonsense.

01:13:22.846 --> 01:13:24.400
Think you can do better?

01:13:26.022 --> 01:13:27.299
I'll take
out these Exiles

01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.370
and swing around
and pick you up.

01:13:29.508 --> 01:13:30.406
Find an exit.

01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:32.200
Easy for you to say.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.343
Ah!

01:14:20.283 --> 01:14:21.111
Whoa!

01:14:32.226 --> 01:14:32.916
Ah!

01:14:45.204 --> 01:14:46.274
Thomas, hit the button.

01:14:46.412 --> 01:14:47.586
What button?

01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:49.899
The one over there.

01:15:11.092 --> 01:15:12.093
Grab him! Hurry!

01:15:12.231 --> 01:15:13.232
I'm on it!

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:27.833
You're alive!

01:15:29.179 --> 01:15:30.180
You son of a gun!

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:32.320
No!

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.529
I can't believe it!

01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:34.495
Yeah.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.912
Wow!

01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.604
Yeah. Get off me.

01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:41.675
Sorry. Sorry.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.403
Remember me?

01:15:47.612 --> 01:15:50.028
How could I forget a
floating alarm clock?

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:52.133
I'll show
you something alarming.

01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.618
Hey!

01:15:53.756 --> 01:15:57.000
Spark!

01:15:57.138 --> 01:15:59.175
How is that
for an alarm clock?

01:16:06.216 --> 01:16:10.151
Colonials, if
you're receiving this message,

01:16:10.289 --> 01:16:12.637
please take in
with great caution.

01:16:12.775 --> 01:16:15.536
The Exiles destroyed my
ship, and I'm sad to report

01:16:15.674 --> 01:16:18.574
that they took the lives of
both poor Allie and Jesse.

01:16:19.989 --> 01:16:24.165
Grom is alive, and now
more dangerous than ever.

01:16:24.303 --> 01:16:26.582
The Exiles planted
an electric barrier

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.963
that blocked all
communication in and out.

01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:31.621
The Resistance are
extremely outmatched.

01:16:31.759 --> 01:16:32.691
Their lives,

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:34.935
no, our lives,

01:16:35.073 --> 01:16:37.765
depend on the help
of the Colonials.

01:16:37.903 --> 01:16:42.045
So please, I urge you, send
help before it's too late.
