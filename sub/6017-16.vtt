WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:04.026
The bus is the single
stupidest, fattest...

00:05.672 --> 00:08.266
...slowest, most despised vehicle
on the road, isn't it?

00:08.441 --> 00:10.705
Ever notice when you get behind
a bus, people go:

00:10.877 --> 00:13.277
"What are you doing?
Get away. Come on."

00:13.446 --> 00:15.937
The back of the bus,
it's like an eclipse, isn't it?

00:16.116 --> 00:18.516
People are just like,
"The sun. Where is the sun?"

00:18.685 --> 00:20.482
It's like this huge metal ass...

00:20.653 --> 00:24.521
...just taking up the whole
windshield of your car.

00:24.691 --> 00:28.889
When it pulls out, it even sounds like
a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa.

00:35.902 --> 00:38.336
-It's just not good. It's not good.
-It's not good.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.032
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring.
We're both boring.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.766
We go out to eat,
read newspapers.

00:43.943 --> 00:46.639
-At breakfast, everybody reads.
-No, lunch, we read.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.713
-Dinner, we read.
-You read during lunch?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.645
-Yeah.
-Oh, well.

00:50.817 --> 00:53.012
-Nothing to talk about.
-What's there to talk about?

00:53.186 --> 00:55.211
At least we're talking about
how there's nothing.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.322
Talk with her about how
there's nothing.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.787
She knows there's nothing.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.222
-At least she'll be talking.
-Oh, shut up.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.918
-Hey, look who's here.
-Hey, Al.

01:03.096 --> 01:06.429
-Hey, Al. How's it going?
-Deeply in love.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.590
We have so many things
to talk about.

01:08.768 --> 01:12.135
Sometimes, we'll talk all night...

01:12.305 --> 01:14.296
...till the sun comes up.

01:15.475 --> 01:18.444
-So how about you?
-Oh, I'm seeing someone, yes.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.079
-You know her. Daphne Bauer.
-Great girl.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.771
We have no need to speak.

01:22.949 --> 01:25.042
We communicate
with deep, soulful looks.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.311
Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.153
-Did you hear about Fulton?
-Yeah.

01:31.324 --> 01:34.191
Yeah, I went by the hospital
to see him a few days ago.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.021
Think he'd really like you to visit.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.788
-Me?
-Yeah.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.262
-Said he could use a good laugh.
-What about me?

01:40.433 --> 01:41.957
He didn't mention you.

01:42.969 --> 01:44.994
This is my stop.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.662
-See you.
-Yeah, see you.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.135
"Deeply in love."

01:50.310 --> 01:52.608
You can't say something bad
about relationships...

01:52.779 --> 01:54.838
...you shouldn't say anything at all.

01:58.918 --> 02:00.818
I didn't know
Fulton was in the hospital.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.352
"Could use a good laugh."

02:02.522 --> 02:04.183
You know what pressure that is?

02:04.357 --> 02:05.619
Come on, come with me.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.453
I'm not good in these situations.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.788
I... I can't hide my pity.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.022
I... I make them feel worse.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.995
-Oh, stop it.
-Also, I'm afraid...

02:14.167 --> 02:17.830
...that people in that state are finally
gonna tell me what they really think.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.131
They got nothing to lose.
What do they care?

02:20.306 --> 02:23.275
-So you're not gonna come?
-No, but say hello for me.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.100
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:25.278 --> 02:27.143
-Hey, Mick.
-Hey, Jerry.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.144
-What's doing?
-Nothing. You?

02:29.315 --> 02:31.306
Same old, same old.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.917
George, this is Mickey.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.816
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.549
-How's work going, you guys?
-Let's not talk about it.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.852
-You got a job?
-Yeah. Mickey hooked me up.

02:41.027 --> 02:43.552
We're stand-ins for the actors
on <i>All My Children</i>.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.823
Mickey's a stand-in
for an 8-year-old kid...

02:45.999 --> 02:47.967
...and I stand in for the kid's father.

02:48.134 --> 02:49.431
But I got a big problem.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.502
The kid I stand in for, he's growing.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.400
He was 4 feet last month.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.302
Now he's like 4'2" and a half.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.409
He shot up 2 and a half inches.

02:57.577 --> 03:01.035
I can do 4'2", 4'3" is a stretch.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.182
Any higher,
I'm gonna be out on my ass...

03:03.349 --> 03:04.748
...doing that paralegal crap.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.380
How do you stop a kid from growing?

03:07.554 --> 03:10.751
I told you, you should offer him
some cigarettes.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.491
I offered him cigarettes...

03:13.660 --> 03:16.220
...but his stupid mother's
always hanging around.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.761
She won't let him have any.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.864
-What about lifts?
-Out of the question.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.524
Can't you just switch
with another midget?

03:25.071 --> 03:26.732
It's "little people."

03:26.906 --> 03:30.103
-You got that?
-Easy, Mickey. Easy.

03:31.744 --> 03:33.075
Yeah.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.147
We gotta get back to the show.
What are you guys doing?

03:36.316 --> 03:39.547
-Going to the hospital to visit Fulton.
-Well, say hello for me.

03:42.288 --> 03:45.086
Now, look. We're gonna stop
at the shoemaker right now.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.226
You gotta get some lifts
for your shoes.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.920
Lifts? Kramer, you don't understand.
This kind of thing is just not done.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.065
-You wanna keep your job?
-Yeah, but...

03:53.233 --> 03:55.531
-No buts.
-Kramer...

04:00.139 --> 04:01.572
Hey.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.103
Fulton!

04:04.277 --> 04:05.642
It's me.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.609
Hey, Jerry. Good to see you.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.680
-I could use a good laugh.
-Who couldn't?

04:09.849 --> 04:13.876
-I haven't cracked a smile in months.
-Oh, don't worry. You'll crack.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.748
Cracking's inevitable.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.913
First you crack, then you chuckle.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.889
That was the Russians' motto
at the Siege of Leningrad:

04:21.060 --> 04:22.789
First you crack, then you chuckle.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.321
You know, because Leningrad...

04:26.499 --> 04:29.593
...when the Nazis attacked,
it wasn't a very happy time.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.600
Because of the war.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.103
Famine.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.674
Plus, it was cold. Very cold.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.475
They were eating each other.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.115
Maybe this isn't a good time
for a visit.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.773
No, it's a fine time.

04:46.653 --> 04:50.487
All right. There's a priest, a minister
and a rabbi, and they're all skydiving.

04:58.197 --> 04:59.789
So how are the eggs?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.729
Eggs are eggs.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.627
Eggs are eggs.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.034
That is very profound.

05:07.206 --> 05:10.505
By the same token,
could you say, "Fish is fish"?

05:10.677 --> 05:12.201
I don't think so.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.470
-Listen, Daphne...
-Daphne.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.138
Daphne.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.985
I have to tell you something.
This is very difficult...

05:22.155 --> 05:24.646
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.985
Al Nechy called me today.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.261
Yeah. I bumped into him on the bus.
What did he have to say?

05:30.430 --> 05:33.228
He told me not to get involved with you.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.132
-What?
-Yeah.

05:35.301 --> 05:37.701
He said you could never make
a commitment...

05:37.870 --> 05:40.498
...and you'd just wind up hurting me.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.671
He said that?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.810
What a nerve.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.343
How dare he say something like that.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.846
-Is it true?
-Of course not.

05:51.417 --> 05:56.184
I mean, sure, there may have been
one or two occasions in the past...

05:56.356 --> 05:59.348
...when I may have reacted...

05:59.525 --> 06:02.153
...in an impulsive
or somewhat immature manner...

06:02.328 --> 06:05.627
...but those days are well behind me.

06:08.234 --> 06:11.169
How long are you gonna be
away for, Daddy?

06:11.637 --> 06:13.605
I'm not really going away.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.799
I told you,
I'll be back every other weekend.

06:16.976 --> 06:20.412
Don't go, Daddy. Don't go.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.279
Now, Porter...

06:24.917 --> 06:27.818
...you know your mother and I
love you very much...

06:27.987 --> 06:29.420
...but...

06:29.589 --> 06:32.888
...sometimes people fall out of love.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.157
Now, give me a big hug.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.525
And there's your scene.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.030
-Stand-ins?
-Yo.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.431
All right, you guys. Get on their spots.
We gotta fix the lights.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.037
That's good work.

06:51.377 --> 06:53.436
All right. Ready.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.810
How long you gonna be
away for, Daddy?

07:00.887 --> 07:03.720
I'm not really going away.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.291
I told you
I'd be back every other weekend.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.262
Don't go, Daddy. Don't go.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.227
Now, listen, Porter.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.836
You know your mother and I
love you very much...

07:18.004 --> 07:21.599
...but sometimes
people fall out of love.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.106
Now, give me a big hug.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.170
All right. Kramer.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.178
Kramer.

07:30.349 --> 07:34.479
Okay, that's lunch, everybody.
One hour.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.992
-How do those lifts feel?
-Quiet.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.123
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Tammy.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.128
You look different.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.995
-Have you been working out?
-Not that I know of.

07:49.669 --> 07:52.035
Whatever it is, keep doing it.
You look great.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.368
-How about lunch?
-Oh, I can't today...

07:55.541 --> 07:57.475
...but I see it in our future.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.308
-See you, Kramer.
-Yeah.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.810
Bye, Mickey.

08:01.347 --> 08:03.679
-Oh, she likes you, buddy.
-Yeah.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.477
Yeah.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.881
-All of a sudden.
-What?

08:08.054 --> 08:09.385
Hey, Mick.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.552
-How you doing, Johnny?
-What gives? What's going on?

08:12.725 --> 08:14.454
-You going out with Tammy?
-Maybe.

08:14.627 --> 08:16.424
What's it to you?

08:16.596 --> 08:18.496
There's something different
about you.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.657
-I got my hair cut, that's all.
-No, that's not it. Something else.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.769
Yeah. You look different.

08:24.937 --> 08:28.498
You don't. You got the same ugly mug
you had since the day I met you.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.835
I don't know what it is,
but I'll find out.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.034
I'll find out.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.845
Don't believe him.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.317
So she's just sitting there,
and then Pachyderm...

08:40.486 --> 08:43.250
You remember the 'Derm.
He says, "I'm gonna go up to her."

08:43.422 --> 08:47.051
So he picks up
the two pieces of pizza and...

08:47.226 --> 08:48.557
And they're steaming hot.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.821
They're burning his hands,
so he's juggling.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.430
He's throwing them in the air.

08:52.598 --> 08:56.034
And just as he gets up to her,
down they go.

08:56.335 --> 08:57.768
Well, we all just lost it.

09:00.172 --> 09:01.605
It was really, really funny.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.038
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey, Phil. How you doing?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.112
-You look terrific.
-I got my health.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.476
Well, that's the most important thing.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.675
Hey, how you doing, Fulton?

09:12.852 --> 09:15.082
Octane, butane, night train!

09:16.822 --> 09:20.417
-How's he doing?
-He could use a couple laughs.

09:21.694 --> 09:25.892
You should've told the story
about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.396
I told it. Yeah.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.364
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-Yeah.

09:31.604 --> 09:34.300
Hey, you know what?
As I was leaving, I saw Phil Tatola.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.737
He is one of the greatest guys.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.434
-Do I know him?
-No. But of all the guys I know...

09:39.612 --> 09:42.103
...I could envision you
going out with him.

09:42.281 --> 09:45.341
If you were a woman,
would you go out with him?

09:45.518 --> 09:49.010
If I was a woman, I'd be at the dock
waiting for the fleet to come in.

09:49.555 --> 09:52.046
Yeah, I bet you would.
All right, give him my number.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.623
All right.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.421
This, you're not gonna believe.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.622
Al Nechy, that pimple...

10:00.166 --> 10:02.293
...tells Daphne... Now, get this.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.129
-Not to get involved with me.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.328
-What?
-Yeah. That's what she told me.

10:06.505 --> 10:10.032
-Why?
-He's afraid that she's gonna get hurt.

10:10.209 --> 10:11.870
-Is she?
-Of course.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.538
-So?
-What? He doesn't have to tell her.

10:17.950 --> 10:21.613
-Maybe he likes her.
-Oh, no, no. He's deeply in love.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.153
I was about to break up with her
when she told me.

10:24.323 --> 10:27.292
-So, what are you gonna do?
-I can't break up with her now.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.321
-Why?
-Because he said I was going to.

10:31.497 --> 10:34.898
So now you're gonna keep
going out with her for spite?

10:35.067 --> 10:38.730
-Yes. I am.
-Yeah, I could see that.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.929
-I don't see any way around it.
-Me either.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.972
-What choice do I have?
-None.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.920
Fulton's wife told me
it's all my fault.

11:06.098 --> 11:09.556
She said since my visit,
he's taken a turn for the worse.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.739
-Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?
-Yeah, I told him the Pachyderm story.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.340
Maybe I'll go over there.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.478
-Towards what end?
-I'm very good with sick people.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.078
They love me.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.215
When my friend
Len Nickidimo had gout...

11:23.382 --> 11:25.543
...I was in his hospital room
for three days.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.084
The doctors were amazed
at his recovery.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.488
-Hey.
-Hey, Mick.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.686
Johnny Viggiano went through
my locker.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.698
That little bastard.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.126
He saw the lifts in my shoes.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.862
He knows I'm heightening.

11:47.106 --> 11:50.166
This never would've happened
if you didn't push me to get those.

11:50.342 --> 11:52.606
-I told you.
-Nobody put a gun to your head.

11:52.778 --> 11:55.110
Yeah. Just keep out
of my business, you big ape.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.078
Who you calling "big ape"?

11:57.249 --> 11:59.547
I'm calling you an ape.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.449
All right, break it up.
Come on, you two.

12:02.621 --> 12:05.112
Just cut it out now.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.521
Yeah.

12:11.363 --> 12:12.921
Behave yourselves.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.263
-I'm sorry, Kramer.
-No, it's all right, it's all right.

12:17.436 --> 12:20.132
You're stressed out.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.740
Why does this Johnny
have it in for you?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.901
He's always been jealous of me.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.843
I always got to stand in
for the bigger stars.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.813
The Cosby kids, Ricky Schroder,
Macaulay Culkin.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.653
-What's he like?
-He's a good kid.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.289
-Yeah?
-What does he care if you put lifts in?

12:38.457 --> 12:39.719
You don't understand.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.087
There's an unwritten code
about this.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.990
I could be ostracized.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.930
I remember when I was a kid,
some guy tried to heighten.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.434
He lost his job,
lost his friends, everything.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.869
I knew I was crazy to try
this kind of thing...

12:55.040 --> 12:57.668
...but I was so desperate.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.908
What is this kid taking, anyway?

13:00.079 --> 13:01.603
Hormones? Steroids?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.681
Would you tell me?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.111
Well, here we are.

13:06.485 --> 13:09.784
George, tomorrow's Sunday.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.447
We could sleep late
and get the paper...

13:13.626 --> 13:17.426
...and have breakfast
and spend the morning together...

13:17.596 --> 13:21.498
...go for a long walk,
maybe do a little shopping...

13:21.667 --> 13:24.898
...have lunch...
-You know what? I...

13:25.070 --> 13:27.630
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to stay over tonight.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.401
-Why not?
-Yeah, I really should go home.

13:30.576 --> 13:33.340
Actually, I'm planning on spending
the day with my father.

13:33.512 --> 13:34.843
We're...

13:35.014 --> 13:37.881
We're going to a father-son picnic,
just the two of us.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.348
I thought we were gonna spend
the day together.

13:40.519 --> 13:44.319
Well, Dad's been planning this
for such a long time.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.821
He bought a new blanket.

13:45.991 --> 13:50.052
And he got that game with the foam
paddles and the Velcro ball.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.990
Have you given any more thought
to what we talked about?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.724
You know, moving in?

13:55.901 --> 13:59.098
Yes. Oh, yes. Very much.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.205
Maybe you don't wanna move in.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.238
No, no, I do. You know, it's just...

14:03.409 --> 14:07.641
Maybe Al Nechy was right. Maybe
I shouldn't have gotten involved.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.212
No, he's not right.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.178
Al Nechy is not right.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.846
All right, I'm canceling
the father-son picnic.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.479
I don't know what he's gonna do
with all that potato salad.

14:22.228 --> 14:26.722
So then Pachyderm picks up
the two pieces of pizza.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.834
And mind you, now,
they're burning hot.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.129
He can barely hold them.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.068
He's trying to, like, juggle the pizza.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.368
You know. I mean...

14:37.543 --> 14:41.502
-And then they go flying...
-I'm gonna pee my pants.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.511
They go flying out of his hands.

14:43.682 --> 14:50.087
And one lands on her face,
and the other lands on his face.

14:52.658 --> 14:55.252
I mean, the whole place went crazy.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.658
-Oh, what a story.
-Oh, God. I know. I know.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.628
That is one of the funniest stories...

15:00.799 --> 15:03.267
...I've ever heard.
-I know.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.201
Well, this has been
one hell of a night.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.170
I'm sorry Jerry didn't
suggest this sooner.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.269
You know...

15:11.577 --> 15:13.909
...you really are beautiful, Elaine.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.675
Well...

15:19.218 --> 15:21.015
-Good night.
-Good night?

15:21.487 --> 15:23.216
Well...

15:26.992 --> 15:28.892
Come on, Adrian.
Give me another chance.

15:29.061 --> 15:30.824
I know I can cheer Fulton up.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.123
I'll tell you what. I'll do my act.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.891
No, new material.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.160
He's never heard it.

15:37.336 --> 15:41.295
He'll love it. I just did it
at the Concorde last week. It killed.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.340
Thank you. Thanks...
You will not regret this.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.671
Okay. Bye. Hey.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.972
Hello.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.010
So?

15:51.617 --> 15:54.677
-What?
-Come on, how was your date?

15:54.853 --> 15:57.253
Oh, the date.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.516
The date.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.193
-Yeah. How was it?
-Interesting.

16:02.828 --> 16:05.991
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.695
-Why? What happened?
-Let's see.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.302
How shall I put this?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.268
Well, just put it.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.363
He took it out.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.245
He what?

16:23.549 --> 16:25.744
He took...

16:26.552 --> 16:28.281
...it out.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.546
He took what out?

16:33.759 --> 16:35.056
It.

16:35.227 --> 16:37.889
He took it out?

16:38.297 --> 16:39.730
Yes, sirree, Bob.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.995
-He couldn't.
-He did.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.560
You were involved
in some sort of amorous...

16:45.738 --> 16:48.036
No.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.767
-You mean, he just..?
-Yes.

16:50.943 --> 16:54.003
-Are you sure?
-Oh, quite.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.477
There was no mistaking it?

16:57.649 --> 16:59.116
Jerry.

16:59.385 --> 17:02.616
So you were talking, you're having
a pleasant conversation...

17:02.788 --> 17:04.483
...and then all of a sudden...
-Yeah.

17:04.656 --> 17:05.987
-It.
-It.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.715
-Out.
-Out.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.390
Well, I can't believe this. I know Phil.

17:10.561 --> 17:12.723
He's a good friend.
We play softball together.

17:12.897 --> 17:15.992
-How could this be?
-Oh, it be.

17:17.169 --> 17:20.798
Have you got any other friends
you wanna set me up with?

17:22.574 --> 17:23.905
Hey.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.203
Hey, how was your date
with Phil Tatola?

17:26.377 --> 17:28.368
He took it out.

17:33.685 --> 17:37.018
Well, maybe it needed some air.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.385
You know, sometimes they need air.
They can't breathe in there.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.151
It's inhuman.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.962
So she's just sitting there,
she's having a pleasant conversation...

17:49.134 --> 17:50.795
...and all of a sudden...
-It.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.436
-It.
-Out.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.737
I spend time trying to get
their clothes off...

17:58.911 --> 18:00.742
...I never thought of taking mine off.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.979
Hey, get out of here.
Daphne's gonna be here.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.584
All right, I'm going.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.482
You know what I've come to realize?

18:09.655 --> 18:11.020
I'm not just bored.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.750
I genuinely dislike her.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.917
Well, how long are you gonna
keep this up?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.120
Hey, I'll get married if I have to.

18:18.997 --> 18:22.194
Al Nechy will think twice before
he opens his mouth about me again.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.301
George, they're doing
wonderful things...

18:24.470 --> 18:26.404
...at mental institutions these days.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.767
I'd be happy to set up
a meet-and-greet.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.273
I'm very disappointed
to hear you talk like that.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.776
-Still don't know what makes me tick.
-Yes, I do.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.313
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to see Fulton.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.475
I'm not even saying hello.
I'm going right into material.

18:45.491 --> 18:49.154
-Hey, Jer.
-Oh, hey, Phil.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.793
I'm sorry things
didn't work out with Elaine.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.455
I don't know what I did wrong.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.698
Well, you showed her who you are.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.801
Oh, look at this.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.965
What, she's gotta
breast-feed in public?

19:06.378 --> 19:08.846
Yeah, that's the last thing
you wanna see.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.414
Well, next to last.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.980
-Look, I'll see you.
-Yeah, take it easy.

19:15.454 --> 19:18.184
<i>Dr. Callahan. Dr. Callahan.</i>

19:20.659 --> 19:24.186
Hey, how you doing?
Good to be here.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.863
-Rock, paper, scissors. Match.
-Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.662
All right. Rock beats paper.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.271
I thought paper covered rock.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.500
No. Rock flies right through paper.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.109
Well, what beats rock?

19:40.979 --> 19:42.844
Nothing beats rock.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.380
All right, come on.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.674
Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.183
-Rock.
-Rock.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.911
Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.578
-Rock.
-Rock.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.055
Hey, Bob. Hey, what's with you?

19:54.226 --> 19:55.557
You got a problem?

19:55.727 --> 19:58.890
-You see that look he gave me?
-Come on. Here. Ready?

19:59.464 --> 20:01.398
Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

20:01.567 --> 20:02.898
-Rock.
-Rock.

20:03.068 --> 20:05.093
-Hey, Tammy.
-Hello.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.433
So, Tammy, finally,
today's our big lunch.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.666
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

20:10.842 --> 20:13.333
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Look, Mickey.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.412
Everybody knows
that you're heightening.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.242
It's all over the set.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.247
-Wait. Wait...
-Don't touch me.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.750
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.047
All the progress we've made
over the years...

20:24.223 --> 20:26.555
...and you blow it
with a stupid stunt like that.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.250
Wait a second. Wait a second.
You got me all wrong.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.419
It was all because of the kid.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.258
The kid was growing.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.731
He shot up 2 and a half inches
in a month.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.401
I would've lost my job.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.404
Any one of you would've
done the same.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.405
You got no right.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.203
I'm Mickey Abbot.

20:46.378 --> 20:50.405
I stood in for Punky Brewster
when all of you was nothing.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.846
It's all his fault.

20:53.151 --> 20:54.641
It was his idea.

20:54.953 --> 20:58.650
Come on, Johnny.
Let's go get something to eat.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.795
Mickey.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.332
-This guy's belching up vitamins.
-Stop.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.237
And this whole Justice League...

21:18.410 --> 21:20.674
...Batman, Green Lantern,
Wonder Woman.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.679
You mean to tell me Superman
can't cover everything?

21:23.849 --> 21:28.684
-Stop.
-For crying out loud, he's Superman.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.629
Fulton?

21:43.869 --> 21:45.632
Fulton?

21:54.212 --> 21:58.672
George, first let me just say
that I've never been with a guy...

21:58.850 --> 22:01.045
...who was so committed to commit.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.449
I mean, it's so rare
in men these days...

22:03.622 --> 22:07.023
...and that's what makes this
all the more difficult.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.185
Difficult?

22:10.362 --> 22:13.490
The other day after work,
some girlfriends and I went to a bar...

22:13.665 --> 22:16.463
...for some drinks,
and there was this crazy mishap...

22:16.635 --> 22:20.002
...and I wound up meeting someone
as a result.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.367
George.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.374
Please don't.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.746
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:29.915 --> 22:33.248
I'm afraid the worst of it is
it's someone you know.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.181
Jerry Persach.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.515
Pachyderm?

22:38.390 --> 22:41.359
He was carrying
these two pieces of pizza...
