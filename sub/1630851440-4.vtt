ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.958
ANY SIMILARITY TO ACTUAL EVENTS,
PERSONS, OR ORGANIZATIONS

00:10.041 --> 00:10.916
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:33.708 --> 00:34.541
Let's walk.

00:59.375 --> 01:05.875
<i>Since the last time we spoke alone</i>

01:05.958 --> 01:12.416
<i>I kept calling out for you in my sleep
Begging for mercy</i>

01:12.500 --> 01:17.541
<i>What's going on? I want to know</i>

01:17.625 --> 01:20.250
<i>Something in me has changed</i>

01:26.250 --> 01:31.958
<i>Maybe it's the look in your eyes
Are they casting a spell?</i>

01:32.708 --> 01:39.291
<i>Maybe some star is using you
To play an impossible trick</i>

01:39.375 --> 01:43.625
<i>I'm confused because you're confusing</i>

01:43.708 --> 01:46.625
<i>Oh, I want to love</i>

01:50.333 --> 01:51.916
Turn off the music.

01:55.708 --> 01:57.041
I heard you've been bad, honey.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.041
If you're short of money

01:59.791 --> 02:02.541
or Kiew isn't taking
good care of your parents,

02:02.625 --> 02:03.625
you can tell me.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.416
He's trying to get
on the reporter's good side.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.875
They seem very close.

02:12.916 --> 02:14.000
You naughty little shit.

02:16.916 --> 02:18.541
Why did you try to hurt Kat?

02:22.208 --> 02:24.750
What an unpleasant word.

02:25.291 --> 02:28.958
I was teaching her a lesson.
Like a life coach.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.041
But it doesn't seem to be getting through.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.833
Leave my parents alone. Leave Kat alone.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.625
Fuck with me all you want.
Just get it over with.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.833
You're so cute and annoying.

02:43.708 --> 02:48.875
Around here, you don't get
to negotiate with me or threaten me.

02:49.875 --> 02:51.291
Act nice.

02:51.375 --> 02:52.916
Be our brother

02:53.000 --> 02:54.083
like Jo was.

02:55.416 --> 02:58.750
You forced him,
just like what you're doing to me.

02:58.833 --> 02:59.958
Forced

03:00.583 --> 03:01.583
or compelled?

03:03.791 --> 03:05.083
-Jackie.
-Yes, sir.

03:09.458 --> 03:10.583
Look. Was I forcing him?

03:11.291 --> 03:13.166
<i>Can we talk about this?</i>

03:13.750 --> 03:15.375
<i>We're in the business together.</i>

03:50.208 --> 03:51.583
Looks like it.

03:52.541 --> 03:54.250
Sure looks like it.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.000
-Asshole!
-Hey.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.875
You're being rude.

04:01.958 --> 04:02.791
Hey.

04:04.208 --> 04:06.333
Do you understand now what Jo was like?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.541
Jo was strong and loyal.

04:11.541 --> 04:15.500
That guy was not the first
to take a bullet from Jo.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.166
Now that you understand,

04:19.875 --> 04:21.416
you must work for me.

04:27.125 --> 04:29.666
You can help me shut that reporter up.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.666
Don't let her cause us any more trouble.

04:38.416 --> 04:39.458
Music on.

04:40.291 --> 04:41.250
Let's jam.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.333
I'll sing for you.

04:45.666 --> 04:50.583
<i>I loved you first, it can't be undone</i>

04:50.666 --> 04:56.833
<i>My heart keeps peeking
At you sentimentally</i>

04:56.916 --> 05:01.083
<i>You sweep me off my feet</i>

05:01.166 --> 05:05.458
<i>I hug my pillow every night</i>

05:05.541 --> 05:09.958
<i>How long can I hold out if I miss you?</i>

05:10.041 --> 05:11.041
Jackie.

05:44.958 --> 05:46.625
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

05:53.250 --> 05:54.625
<i>Let's not see each other again.</i>

05:55.666 --> 05:58.875
<i>I hope you can believe
that Jo had a good heart.</i>

06:19.416 --> 06:21.000
I'm not saying this to make you feel bad,

06:22.708 --> 06:23.708
but Jo and I,

06:25.625 --> 06:27.083
we used to stand here together.

06:32.916 --> 06:33.916
I really miss him.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.708
INCOMING CALL FROM KAT

07:03.791 --> 07:04.708
<i>Are you in your room?</i>

07:09.416 --> 07:10.791
I'm having dinner with Aod.

08:10.916 --> 08:11.958
Tell me the truth.

08:16.625 --> 08:17.916
Why are you doing this?

08:19.083 --> 08:20.458
What has my family done to you?

08:23.375 --> 08:25.500
If you don't like me, just kill me.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.750
Do you think I'm a psychopath?

08:31.666 --> 08:32.500
Well?

08:33.250 --> 08:34.333
I don't kill people for nothing.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.458
I work

08:38.541 --> 08:39.666
to make a living.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.333
Just like everyone else.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.375
I only kill…

08:48.625 --> 08:50.958
when there are problems
within the organization.

08:53.916 --> 08:54.791
Especially

08:55.791 --> 08:57.041
loyalty issues.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.208
If you and Jo were on the same side,

09:05.833 --> 09:07.125
why did Hardcore say

09:08.791 --> 09:10.250
that I have to work to pay off Jo's debt?

09:15.083 --> 09:16.000
Jo made a mistake.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.916
He betrayed us.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.083
So…

09:31.583 --> 09:33.083
how much longer do I have to do this?

09:36.791 --> 09:38.166
It's hard to say.

09:43.125 --> 09:43.958
If you don't act up,

09:48.666 --> 09:49.500
soon enough,

09:51.166 --> 09:52.083
you'll be let off.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.083
I give you my word.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.000
Let's go.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.541
I feel like an idiot

11:50.250 --> 11:51.958
for letting you string me along.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.333
You were working with Pratheep all along.

11:59.708 --> 12:00.958
Why did you lie to me?

12:01.875 --> 12:02.708
Kat.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.833
I wasn't trying to fool you.

12:09.583 --> 12:10.875
It's obvious.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.166
Why are you still lying to me?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
My hands were tied, Kat.

12:25.708 --> 12:27.541
I didn't want to lie to you.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.375
I was almost an accomplice to your crime.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.833
No, Kat. It had nothing to do with you.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.958
It has something to do with my brother.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.958
It's true that I work for them,

13:00.791 --> 13:02.875
but I couldn't tell you. It's too risky.

13:03.708 --> 13:06.583
Not only are you a liar,
but you're selfish too.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.416
Kat!

13:19.541 --> 13:21.250
I did it to protect you.

13:37.541 --> 13:38.750
I don't believe you anymore.

13:45.416 --> 13:46.250
Kat.

13:48.916 --> 13:49.750
Kat.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.583
Kat.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.625
<i>Can I stay here for a few more days?</i>

14:48.708 --> 14:49.916
<i>Of course.</i>

14:58.625 --> 15:00.291
PRANOM COOKERY

15:41.875 --> 15:42.708
Hey.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.583
Kat, why do you look so worn out?

15:47.333 --> 15:48.375
I'm fine.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.375
Why are you here so early?

15:54.041 --> 15:54.958
I couldn't sleep.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.291
-What?
-Let me put my bag down.

16:01.125 --> 16:01.958
I…

16:08.750 --> 16:13.125
Last night, Artorn
laid me off as he did to you.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.625
What the hell? Why is he doing this?

16:18.708 --> 16:19.541
What about Wee?

16:20.291 --> 16:21.458
Didn't he do anything?

16:24.208 --> 16:25.708
He has to let some photographers go.

16:26.666 --> 16:28.000
What could he do?

16:29.208 --> 16:30.791
Besides, I'm not that good at it.

16:33.416 --> 16:34.916
I'm not a valuable employee.

16:36.708 --> 16:37.541
Hey.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.875
It's not like that at all.

16:41.916 --> 16:43.916
Artorn has no eye for talent.

16:44.750 --> 16:46.708
He has no taste. You know that.

16:52.708 --> 16:53.708
Never mind.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.208
I've been in this industry
for a while now.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.750
I'm sure some of my friends
will help me out. I'll be fine.

17:04.708 --> 17:05.625
So…

17:06.666 --> 17:07.958
seeing as I'm free now,

17:09.416 --> 17:11.083
I'll help you.

17:14.791 --> 17:15.750
I want to be famous too.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.208
Thank you.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.333
I've been a bit lonely.

17:28.916 --> 17:31.625
I doubt that. What about Wanchai?

17:36.166 --> 17:37.000
That's over.

17:39.541 --> 17:40.375
Over?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.125
What do you mean by over?

17:43.916 --> 17:45.750
What do you mean?

17:47.208 --> 17:48.041
Kat.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.125
Are you here for the rescue training?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.500
I'm definitely interested.

18:02.791 --> 18:03.708
Bua.

18:04.375 --> 18:08.083
Do you have a minute?
I need to talk to you.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.041
About what?

18:10.125 --> 18:11.708
It's about Wanchai.

18:14.041 --> 18:16.208
You see, I was wondering

18:17.291 --> 18:21.833
what Wanchai and Pratheep
have been up to at Ruampalangjai?

18:25.750 --> 18:26.875
What've they been up to?

18:26.958 --> 18:29.333
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
-Hey.
-What?

18:32.583 --> 18:35.416
Look, we have a guest
visiting the foundation today.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.666
-Aod, do you--
-I have to talk to you. Let's go.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.500
-Who wants to talk?
-Me. This is very important.

18:40.583 --> 18:41.708
At the restaurant.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.208
-Let's eat.
-And talk.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.250
Chill out, okay?

18:45.333 --> 18:46.333
Auntie.

18:47.541 --> 18:48.958
Can we order?

18:51.083 --> 18:51.958
What did you want to ask?

18:56.708 --> 18:59.750
I'd like to thank all the volunteers

18:59.833 --> 19:02.708
for their contribution to society.

19:03.458 --> 19:07.541
In order for each and every one of us
to carry out the good intentions

19:08.166 --> 19:12.208
of the founders
of Ruampalangjai Foundation,

19:13.083 --> 19:18.750
do not be swayed
by criticism or misunderstandings,

19:18.833 --> 19:22.791
because goodness lies
in all of our hearts.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.250
Good hearts and good deeds

19:25.333 --> 19:28.458
are not defined by other people.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.041
RUAMPALANGJAI FOUNDATION

19:30.125 --> 19:32.666
Ruampalangjai, attention!

19:34.666 --> 19:37.750
We, Ruampalangjai,

19:38.333 --> 19:42.833
risk our lives for the people.

19:43.458 --> 19:47.083
Our wages come from donations.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.333
We will devote ourselves
to uphold the good cause.

19:52.416 --> 19:53.708
RUAMPALANGJAI

19:58.833 --> 19:59.916
SAFE SONGKRAN

20:00.000 --> 20:02.541
You've done a lot
for our society, Mr. Wat.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.833
It's no wonder
you have been given the responsibility

20:05.916 --> 20:08.791
of organizing the campaign
to reduce accidents over Songkran.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.708
I'm very proud to be a part of this.

20:12.416 --> 20:13.291
Thank you.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.791
Let's do our best.

20:21.875 --> 20:25.708
We both have a duty
to push society forward.

20:38.166 --> 20:39.083
PLEASE WELCOME OUR HERO

20:39.166 --> 20:40.458
-Sir.
-Yes?

20:40.541 --> 20:42.875
-Wanchai is here to see you.
-I saw him.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.375
Korn, please excuse me.

20:45.916 --> 20:46.750
Let's go, Kwan.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.291
I'm so happy that the hero
Wanchai came to see me.

20:54.208 --> 20:55.333
How are you?

20:56.250 --> 20:57.416
Do you like it?

20:58.500 --> 21:03.125
The staff and I have put
a lot of effort into this project.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.375
I came here to talk to you about that.

21:07.458 --> 21:08.333
That's good.

21:08.416 --> 21:10.250
Would you like a coffee, Wanchai?

21:10.333 --> 21:12.833
It's okay. This won't take long.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.000
What's the matter, Wanchai?

21:16.500 --> 21:17.333
Sir.

21:18.916 --> 21:19.916
I can't do this.

21:20.625 --> 21:22.083
Come on, Wanchai.

21:22.166 --> 21:25.916
I really want to make you

21:26.000 --> 21:28.958
a symbol of altruism.

21:29.708 --> 21:32.750
To be an inspiration and a motivation

21:32.833 --> 21:36.000
for society to be good.

21:36.791 --> 21:40.375
I say we should help each other.

21:40.458 --> 21:41.541
Trust me.

21:44.666 --> 21:45.500
Look at that.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.541
I'm not sure if…

21:53.250 --> 21:55.291
I can be the good guy that you think I am.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.875
I'm really sorry.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.208
I want to thank you
for giving me this opportunity.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.125
Thank you.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.708
There are plenty of pictures like this.

22:37.125 --> 22:40.833
But there's no solid evidence
of their actual crimes.

22:41.791 --> 22:44.375
It needs to be shocking to make an impact.

22:44.458 --> 22:45.333
Do you think

22:46.000 --> 22:49.041
criminals pose for a lot of photos?

22:57.958 --> 22:58.791
Is that yours?

23:00.083 --> 23:01.125
No, it's not.

23:11.166 --> 23:12.458
<i>Babylon.</i>

23:12.541 --> 23:13.958
"Babylon"?

23:15.416 --> 23:16.791
Do you recognize that name?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.125
It's a massage parlor.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.875
Are you saying he wants me
to search for a massage parlor?

23:28.416 --> 23:29.333
Let's see.

23:33.375 --> 23:34.250
BABYLON

23:34.333 --> 23:35.833
BABYLON, THE ANCIENT CITY.
A GATEWAY TO MESOPOTAMIA.

23:40.708 --> 23:43.166
BABYLON, SMART CITY PARK PROJECT.
MATIMUANCHON ONLINE

23:44.208 --> 23:45.041
What?

23:45.708 --> 23:46.916
"Babylon,

23:47.583 --> 23:50.750
Smart City Park Project."

23:56.750 --> 24:00.958
Sometimes, criminals do pose for photos.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.708
We just don't know what they've done yet.

24:06.875 --> 24:07.916
Are you guys hungry?

24:11.458 --> 24:12.416
Sak.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.166
Do you know about this project?

24:15.333 --> 24:18.750
In this picture, why are

24:18.833 --> 24:21.875
Pratheep and Wanchai's brother in it too?

24:27.208 --> 24:29.333
I've heard Mr. Wat mention it.

24:29.958 --> 24:33.375
But it was back
when I was still at Ruampalangjai.

24:35.125 --> 24:38.125
I never knew that
Pratheep and Jo were involved.

24:38.791 --> 24:40.250
It's not surprising though.

24:40.333 --> 24:43.750
Mr. Wat was close with them.

24:47.291 --> 24:50.375
What you guys are doing
is extremely dangerous.

24:50.458 --> 24:51.500
Don't be rash.

24:52.125 --> 24:53.833
-Okay.
-We won't.

24:57.458 --> 24:59.666
This photo doesn't tell us much though.

25:00.583 --> 25:01.416
I think

25:02.166 --> 25:03.666
we need to keep digging.

25:04.541 --> 25:06.083
I also made another one.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.000
Everyone, mealtime!

25:10.208 --> 25:11.708
Come on, let's go eat.

25:11.791 --> 25:12.791
-Sure.
-Okay.

25:13.958 --> 25:14.791
Kat.

25:19.541 --> 25:22.833
<i>If I wanted to create a webpage</i>

25:22.916 --> 25:26.375
to expose the corruption
inside Ruampalangjai,

25:26.458 --> 25:28.291
<i>as Muay set out to do…</i>

25:28.375 --> 25:30.166
SIGN IN

25:30.833 --> 25:32.541
<i>…do you think I could do it?</i>

25:33.250 --> 25:35.791
Why not? Of course, you could.

25:38.416 --> 25:41.500
RUAMPALANGJAI, THE FOUNDATION

25:47.875 --> 25:49.583

25:49.666 --> 25:51.333
THEY COLLUDE WITH HOSPITALS

25:51.416 --> 25:52.250
HOSPITALS GET TREATMENT FEES,
PAY FOR DELIVERY

25:52.333 --> 25:53.666
IT HAPPENED TO ME. #KAK

25:53.750 --> 25:54.583

25:55.083 --> 25:57.208
MY MOM WOKE UP TO FIND HER
BRACELET GONE. NO ONE KNEW A THING.

25:57.291 --> 26:00.291
THEY ALWAYS GO TO TAWANVEJ HOSPITAL
WHEN THERE ARE NEARER ONES.

26:00.791 --> 26:02.625
THE FOUNDATION MUST REPLY.
SILENCE SUGGESTS GUILT.

26:02.708 --> 26:04.708
IS THIS TRUE? NO PROOF. FAKE NEWS.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.083
IF THEY ARE GUILTY,
DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD ADMIT IT?

26:06.166 --> 26:07.291
I'm hungry.

26:07.375 --> 26:10.083
-Hurry up. I'm hungry.
-There they are.

26:10.166 --> 26:11.458
Let's eat.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.208
-Sit down. Hello.
-Hello.

26:13.791 --> 26:14.958
-Hello.
-Hello.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.458
I prepared your favorite dish.

26:18.541 --> 26:19.666
Thank you, Auntie.

26:20.875 --> 26:22.000
It's my favorite too.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.333
-Shall we?
-Let's eat.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.458
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.250
Young man, do you remember me?

26:36.375 --> 26:37.333
I don't think so.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.708
You saved my daughter's life.

26:43.250 --> 26:46.416
My daughter has just graduated
and started work.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.750
If it weren't for you,

26:50.833 --> 26:53.291
my daughter wouldn't be here today.

26:54.916 --> 26:57.291
My family owes you a great deal.

26:58.958 --> 26:59.833
Don't worry about it.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.666
I was just doing my job.

27:03.250 --> 27:05.625
Congratulations on your
daughter's graduation.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.833
Thank you so much.

27:08.666 --> 27:11.041
I won't bother you any longer. Thank you.

27:11.125 --> 27:11.958
-Bye.
-Bye.

27:15.791 --> 27:16.750
Let's eat.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.416
You're the best.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.500
He's the boss.

27:21.083 --> 27:21.916
Eat up.

27:23.625 --> 27:26.750
What about Wanchai? Where is he?

27:26.833 --> 27:29.625
I was going to ask you
where that handsome face is.

27:37.000 --> 27:37.916
I don't know either.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.125
He's probably with Aod, Mom.

27:44.208 --> 27:45.625
They're inseparable these days.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.500
I see.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.125
Let's eat.

27:49.208 --> 27:51.000
-Is it good?
-Pipo.

27:53.291 --> 27:55.125
This might not be the duck's heart,

27:55.625 --> 27:57.625
but it's from my heart.

27:58.583 --> 28:00.916
That's put me off my food.

28:01.541 --> 28:02.583
Come off it.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.833
NO SMOKING

28:14.916 --> 28:17.083
<i>Everybody, let's hurry up.</i>

28:17.166 --> 28:19.166
<i>We're handing it over next week.</i>

28:41.375 --> 28:42.916
Get the ball.

28:43.458 --> 28:44.416
Come on.

28:44.500 --> 28:45.791
Good.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.250
Go. Kick it.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.625
Good job, Chai.

28:50.708 --> 28:53.500

28:56.250 --> 28:59.166
Chai, we have a job. Let's go.

28:59.250 --> 29:00.875
-Hey, guys, I have to go.
-Hurry.

Okay.

to get there first. Let's go.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.375
-Let's take my car.
-Okay.

JAITHAM FOUNDATION

29:55.375 --> 29:56.791
Isn't that Cheep?

29:56.875 --> 29:57.708
Why is he with them?

29:58.375 --> 29:59.916
He has a nerve.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.416
I feel sorry for Sak.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.500
Help me.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.291
-This way.
-This way, please.

30:35.958 --> 30:36.791
Help!

30:39.250 --> 30:40.083
Kat.

30:45.083 --> 30:46.875
Take it easy. Slowly.

30:48.541 --> 30:49.750
Slow and steady.

30:52.708 --> 30:54.250
Get out of here. This is my case.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.291
What are you doing

30:56.916 --> 30:57.750
wearing that?

30:59.916 --> 31:01.375
Leave your son alone.

31:02.708 --> 31:03.833
What are you doing?

31:03.916 --> 31:05.958
Excuse me.

31:06.041 --> 31:09.458
Please help my husband.
He's the project foreman.

31:09.541 --> 31:10.750
-He's in there.
-You can't be here.

31:10.833 --> 31:13.500
-No, he called me. He's still alive.
-Go over there.

31:13.583 --> 31:16.000
-Go and wait. We'll--
-You have to save him.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.541
Sir, please.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.625
-Please help the foreman.
-Please calm down.

31:20.708 --> 31:22.208
-We'll help him.
-How much do you want?

31:22.291 --> 31:24.541
I'll give you all the money you want.

31:24.625 --> 31:25.625
-I have money.
-Boss.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.208
They've shut off the gas,

31:27.291 --> 31:29.166
but it could still be leaking inside.

31:35.625 --> 31:37.166
Help!

31:37.250 --> 31:38.875
I'm stuck in here.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.916
Anybody!

31:41.000 --> 31:42.166
Help me!

32:22.166 --> 32:24.500
-Spread out. Find them.
-In here.

32:24.583 --> 32:27.791
-We're coming.
-Stop the bleeding on this one.

32:27.875 --> 32:29.583
On it.

32:29.666 --> 32:30.708
Help me.

32:30.791 --> 32:32.125
How are you feeling?

32:33.041 --> 32:34.750
-I'm still alive.
-In here.

32:34.833 --> 32:37.500
-Help me.
-Calm down.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.583
I have money. Get me out of here.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.333
-I can't move.
-Is he conscious?

32:41.416 --> 32:43.625
I don't want to die. Get me out of here.

32:44.541 --> 32:46.750
Here. His pulse is very weak.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.833
Uneven breathing. Possible fractured ribs.

32:48.916 --> 32:50.750
Po, push it.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.833
How much do you want? Have it all.

32:52.916 --> 32:56.333
-Get me out of here.
-Guys, let's get this beam off him.

32:56.416 --> 32:59.541
No. Don't do it!

32:59.625 --> 33:02.333
Listen to me. You're safe.

33:02.833 --> 33:04.083
If we move this,

33:04.166 --> 33:05.583
it will kill the other guy.

33:05.666 --> 33:07.625
He's dead anyway.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.541
But he still has a pulse.

33:09.625 --> 33:10.833
Sak.

33:10.916 --> 33:13.083
Do you think you're better
than everyone else?

33:13.166 --> 33:16.500
No one likes good guys
like you. Remember that.

33:16.583 --> 33:17.416
Pratheep.

33:18.416 --> 33:20.958
I know you framed me.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.541
If you're man enough,

33:24.166 --> 33:25.666
why don't you admit to everyone

33:25.750 --> 33:27.416
that it was all down to you?

33:29.208 --> 33:30.083
It's too bad

33:31.125 --> 33:32.791
that Jo is dead.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.333
Otherwise,

33:34.416 --> 33:35.500
you could have seen

33:35.583 --> 33:38.333
who really put you in jail.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.333
You're lying.

33:39.416 --> 33:41.041
Back up. I'm warning you.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.250
I don't believe you.

33:43.375 --> 33:44.416
We're fucked.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.625
The gas level is off the scale.

33:46.708 --> 33:48.875
There must be a leak in here.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.416
We have to get out of here.

33:51.291 --> 33:52.208
Sak, what do we do?

33:52.291 --> 33:54.916
A spark could cause another explosion.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.625
I'll go in and shut the valve.

33:56.708 --> 33:58.166
Wait. I'll come with you.

33:58.875 --> 33:59.916
Wait.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.458
-Good. Lift it.
-Okay.

34:01.541 --> 34:03.708
-Let him go. Let's do this.
-Hey.

34:29.583 --> 34:30.583
The valve is that way.

34:31.708 --> 34:32.541
Turn it off.

34:51.791 --> 34:52.625
Sak!

34:53.250 --> 34:54.083
Sak!

34:55.916 --> 34:57.083
Sak!

34:57.708 --> 34:58.541
Hey.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.250
Sak.

35:04.541 --> 35:06.041
Sak!

35:06.958 --> 35:07.791
Hey!

35:12.000 --> 35:13.041
Sak!

35:21.041 --> 35:22.375
Hey.

35:22.458 --> 35:23.291
Hey.

35:23.833 --> 35:26.791
-How are you feeling?
-Step back.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.750
You're okay, aren't you?

35:28.833 --> 35:31.375
Help them.

35:32.833 --> 35:34.500
Pipo, shut the door.

35:34.583 --> 35:35.541
Hurry.

35:36.833 --> 35:38.291
What about Wanchai?

35:38.916 --> 35:40.166
Where's Wanchai?

35:40.250 --> 35:42.291
Wanchai is still inside with Sak.

35:58.541 --> 35:59.500
Dad!

36:41.666 --> 36:42.583
Go!

36:49.333 --> 36:50.375
Cheep.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.291
Are you guys okay?

37:19.125 --> 37:19.958
Everyone.

37:24.458 --> 37:25.750
-Are you okay?
-Sak.

38:11.833 --> 38:15.708
EMERGENCY

38:21.708 --> 38:23.375
I'll stop bothering you now.

38:23.458 --> 38:25.333
It's no trouble at all.

38:25.416 --> 38:27.583
-It's our job.
-Thank you so much.

38:27.666 --> 38:30.916
-It's all right. Don't thank us.
-We're Ruampalangjai.

38:31.583 --> 38:33.416
-It's okay.
-Thank you so much.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.458
Thank you.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.708
We got money.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.333
Po.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.875
Are you okay?

38:56.666 --> 38:57.791
Just about…

39:00.916 --> 39:03.375
You should go home
and rest. I'll stay with Sak.

39:04.291 --> 39:05.458
That would be good.

39:05.541 --> 39:07.625
Call if anything urgent comes up.

39:07.708 --> 39:09.083
-I will.
-I'm exhausted.

39:09.625 --> 39:11.000
Don't worry about Sak.

39:11.625 --> 39:12.750
He's invincible.

39:21.791 --> 39:23.333
Don't worry too much.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.791
The doctor said
your dad's injuries are not serious.

39:31.541 --> 39:33.500
I'll leave Dad with you then.

39:34.916 --> 39:36.166
I should get going.

39:39.458 --> 39:40.875
Hold on.

39:41.791 --> 39:43.208
Wait for him to wake up.

39:45.791 --> 39:47.166
He doesn't want to see me.

39:51.416 --> 39:53.333
I don't think he
even sees me as his son anymore.

40:00.416 --> 40:01.375
-Cheep.
-Cheep.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.000
-Sak.
-Dad, take it easy.

40:09.958 --> 40:11.208
Dad, move slowly.

40:17.375 --> 40:19.166
Shouldn't you be at Ruampalangjai?

40:44.083 --> 40:45.125
-Cheep.
-Cheep.

40:51.458 --> 40:53.583
Cheep, how is your father?

40:57.541 --> 40:58.500
He's awake.

41:01.291 --> 41:02.541
Hey, where are you going?

41:07.916 --> 41:09.333
He doesn't want to see me.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.791
You're lucky

41:41.875 --> 41:44.125
that it's not too serious.

41:48.125 --> 41:50.708
Thank you for saving my life.

41:53.333 --> 41:54.666
You should thank Cheep.

41:55.458 --> 41:57.750
If he hadn't helped us,

41:57.833 --> 41:58.958
it would have been worse.

42:00.291 --> 42:02.791
What Cheep did was very brave.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.541
<i>How closely do you think your life</i>

42:24.291 --> 42:27.166
<i>follows a righteous path?</i>

42:28.541 --> 42:31.583
<i>I'm sure you've all seen the corruption</i>

42:33.250 --> 42:36.208
<i>that exists everywhere.</i>

42:38.375 --> 42:40.625
<i>Yet why do we turn a blind eye?</i>

42:42.291 --> 42:44.166
<i>Why do we still act like it's normal?</i>

42:52.833 --> 42:55.291
<i>for us to speak out against it?</i>

42:57.083 --> 42:59.083
<i>Don't let those evils</i>

42:59.750 --> 43:03.250
<i>exploit us unimpeded any longer.</i>

43:13.708 --> 43:17.000
<i>I want to ask you about Jo.
I'm coming to see you.</i>

43:53.583 --> 43:54.416
Wanchai.

43:56.458 --> 43:57.791
Can I talk to you?

44:11.208 --> 44:13.333
I'm sorry that

44:14.000 --> 44:16.791
I had a go at you the other night.

44:21.958 --> 44:26.125
If you kept it from me to protect me,

44:26.208 --> 44:27.500
then thank you.

44:31.250 --> 44:33.416
But now I know.

44:34.291 --> 44:37.333
Why don't we share
what we know? About your problem.

44:41.458 --> 44:42.666
If I tell you my problem,

44:44.875 --> 44:46.416
you'll be in danger.

44:49.750 --> 44:50.958
I'm not a child.

44:51.708 --> 44:53.125
I can take care of myself.

44:54.875 --> 44:56.041
Wanchai.

44:57.458 --> 44:59.250
Whatever it is you're doing,

45:01.916 --> 45:04.000
I know it's not really you.

45:21.750 --> 45:24.708
The truth about my brother
will reveal itself soon.

45:27.125 --> 45:29.833
I won't let anyone
dictate my life anymore.

45:32.458 --> 45:33.458
If I succeed,

45:36.208 --> 45:37.875
will you please inform the public?

45:41.958 --> 45:42.916
I will.

45:45.333 --> 45:47.416
But first, you have to convince me.

45:49.875 --> 45:50.875
Thank you.

-Yes.

46:19.291 --> 46:22.000
What's up, Captain Somsak?

46:22.583 --> 46:24.000
I was worried to death.

46:28.958 --> 46:30.125
I won't die that easily.

46:32.875 --> 46:35.125
But today was a close call, wasn't it?

46:35.208 --> 46:36.541
You're just saying that.

46:38.875 --> 46:39.708
Right?

46:44.000 --> 46:44.833
I'm leaving, Mom.

46:44.916 --> 46:46.541
Where are you going?

46:51.208 --> 46:52.250
Are you going to scold me again?

46:53.458 --> 46:54.291
Go ahead.

47:10.291 --> 47:11.541
I'd like to thank you…

47:13.875 --> 47:15.458
for saving my life.

47:20.916 --> 47:22.666
I'm very proud of you.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.958
Very proud.

47:34.000 --> 47:34.958
All this time,

47:39.958 --> 47:41.958
I've wanted you to be more responsible.

47:46.791 --> 47:47.958
If anything happened to me,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.166
your mom would have you to rely on.

47:59.083 --> 48:00.291
But now I know,

48:01.583 --> 48:03.416
I'm confident that you can do it.

48:08.250 --> 48:09.625
That's all that matters to me.

the Chief Secretary,

49:34.541 --> 49:37.250
the Assistant Director, and everyone else

49:37.333 --> 49:38.916
who has supported

the campaign to keep people
on the roads safe from accidents.

49:43.416 --> 49:46.958
We'll kick off
with the Songkran festival this year.

49:47.041 --> 49:50.166
I'd like to take
this opportunity to introduce to you

49:50.708 --> 49:54.541
a senior volunteer from Ruampalangjai,

49:54.625 --> 49:56.708
Mr. Pratheep Saengtharnsong.

49:56.791 --> 49:58.916
Please give a hand to Mr. Pratheep.

49:59.000 --> 49:59.875
Thank you.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.208
Hello.

50:05.166 --> 50:09.083
As a representative
of Ruampalangjai Foundation,

50:09.708 --> 50:13.958
I believe that Mr. Wat's experience,

50:14.041 --> 50:15.750
coupled with his dedication

50:16.708 --> 50:17.958
and funds,

50:21.000 --> 50:26.333
combined with the foundation's
long history,

50:27.708 --> 50:29.125
will allow us

50:30.750 --> 50:34.833
to tackle the problem
of accidents over Songkran

50:35.708 --> 50:37.708
and bring the numbers down for sure.

50:41.416 --> 50:43.291
Cheers!

50:49.208 --> 50:50.291
Good job, bro.

50:54.375 --> 50:57.833
Given the collaboration
between Wattanakarn and Ruampalangjai,

50:57.916 --> 50:59.916
have you heard
of this freelance journalist

51:00.000 --> 51:01.625
behind the KAK page

51:01.708 --> 51:03.791
who released a video accusing Mr. Pratheep

51:03.875 --> 51:06.916
of being involved
with corruption inside Ruampalangjai?

51:07.000 --> 51:10.541
Hold on. What's the name
of the news source again?

51:10.625 --> 51:12.041
KAK.

51:12.125 --> 51:14.000
KAK.

51:14.083 --> 51:15.708
How do you pronounce it? Kak?

51:15.791 --> 51:16.791
-Yeah.
-Right?

51:16.875 --> 51:20.291
Should we concern ourselves with something
whose name sounds like crap?

51:22.958 --> 51:23.791
I'm kidding.

51:24.291 --> 51:27.875
I don't think people should

51:27.958 --> 51:30.291
pay any attention

51:30.375 --> 51:34.625
to things like accusations

51:34.708 --> 51:37.083
that are groundless and lacking evidence.

51:37.166 --> 51:39.041
How about this? Let me make it clearer.

51:39.125 --> 51:41.125
Take one person

51:41.208 --> 51:45.500
<i>who's devoted most of their life</i>

51:45.583 --> 51:48.250
<i>to community service, social service.</i>

51:48.333 --> 51:49.916
<i>Then we have another person</i>

51:50.000 --> 51:51.791
<i>who badmouths others</i>

51:51.875 --> 51:53.583
<i>or tries to undermine certain groups</i>

51:54.125 --> 51:58.375
just to make a name for themselves.

51:58.958 --> 52:00.916
As a member of the press,
which do you think

52:01.000 --> 52:05.166
we should be giving more credence to?

52:05.916 --> 52:07.041
That's true.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.166
-Am I clear?
-Yes.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.916
Thank you so much.
Please excuse me. Goodbye.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.250
Thank you very much, Mr. Wat.

Are you collecting something?

53:23.458 --> 53:25.625
I've been here before to see Thida.

53:28.416 --> 53:29.958
Oh, it's you.

53:31.250 --> 53:32.458
-I'll take it from here.
-Sure.

53:33.666 --> 53:37.041
I've been trying to reach Thida for days,

53:37.125 --> 53:38.625
but I haven't been able to.

53:38.708 --> 53:40.375
She's not answering my calls.

53:40.458 --> 53:41.291
I…

53:42.458 --> 53:44.291
I need to talk to her urgently.

53:45.375 --> 53:47.458
Do you have any idea
how I might get ahold of her?

53:50.500 --> 53:54.041
Thida hasn't been here
since the day you came to see her.

53:55.291 --> 53:56.958
I haven't heard from her either.

53:57.583 --> 53:59.125
I'm quite worried about her.

54:16.875 --> 54:18.166
She did emphasize

54:18.250 --> 54:20.666
that I must not tell anyone
about her whereabouts.

54:23.541 --> 54:24.500
Thank you so much.

54:26.125 --> 54:28.708
You should be careful.

55:27.833 --> 55:31.000
Hi, Thida. I've missed you so much.
