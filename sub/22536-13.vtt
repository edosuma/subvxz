WEBVTT

00:03.800 --> 00:06.667
(gunshot, francis groans)

00:08.840 --> 00:10.831
Agent finley.
Secret service.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.205
Have you found the kids?

00:12.210 --> 00:15.236
(applause)

00:18.050 --> 00:20.109
I was the star witness
for the gibson show.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.542
He came out of there a hero

00:21.550 --> 00:23.768
_ Who almost died
saVIng the preSIdent's son.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.519
And we don't have
a smgle piece

00:25.520 --> 00:27.181
Of hard evidence
against him.

00:27.190 --> 00:29.112
Alicia dutton
is thought to have taken

00:29.130 --> 00:31.348
The last remaining hostage,
beth ann gibson.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.782
What does
francis gibson do

00:32.800 --> 00:34.722
7'0 get his daughter back?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.152
Francis:
Maybe we could
help each other.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.398
What does widener want

00:37.400 --> 00:38.662
With the kidnappers' money?

00:38.670 --> 00:39.967
To turn your men against you.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.392
Dunn:
Still won't
talk about it?

00:41.400 --> 00:43.288
Not a word of what
went on in there.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.164
Amber...

00:45.170 --> 00:46.706
Your aunt susie's here.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.837
Dunn:
Beth ann gibson!

00:48.840 --> 00:49.909
Where is she?

00:49.910 --> 00:51.138
Sold her.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.378
Dunn:
Who has her?

00:52.380 --> 00:54.302
Is it widener?
Don't know.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.742
Screw it...
(gunshots)

01:00.990 --> 01:03.288
(sirens approaching)

01:06.390 --> 01:08.324
Dunn:
She was here.

01:08.330 --> 01:10.423
Before he died, gibson's
number one confirmed.

01:10.430 --> 01:11.829
Beth ann gibson
was here.

01:11.830 --> 01:12.819
Where is she now?

01:12.840 --> 01:14.193
Gone.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.838
Whoever's gonna use gibson
has her now.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.068
We're not gonna find

01:17.070 --> 01:18.332
Gibson's daughter in time.

01:18.340 --> 01:19.762
He's at a vigil for beth ann

01:19.780 --> 01:21.077
At the ballard school.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.105
Go there now and
take him into custody.

01:23.110 --> 01:25.670
I do not want to see
what francis gibson does

01:25.680 --> 01:26.999
To get his daughter back.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.419
Into custody on what charge?

01:28.420 --> 01:30.615
Use the patriot act
if you have to,

01:30.620 --> 01:31.939
Just get him off the street

01:31.950 --> 01:33.747
And into an interrogation room.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.978
Yes, sir.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.027
(door opens)

01:59.150 --> 02:02.017
(choir singing)

02:10.330 --> 02:11.752
Potus is at ballard.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.886
We need to get him out of there.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.322
Why is he there
with gibson?

02:14.330 --> 02:16.298
I'm on the line with
secret serVIce now.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.722
Yes, this is
agent marcus finley.

02:17.730 --> 02:18.992
Please use my voice match

02:19.000 --> 02:20.422
For verification.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.761
I need to alert potus overwatch,
status red.

02:22.770 --> 02:25.500
(singing)

02:31.250 --> 02:33.172
(distorted voice):
Tomorrow, you will do something

02:33.180 --> 02:35.171
That even you
could not have imagined.

02:35.180 --> 02:36.579
You will get the president

02:36.590 --> 02:38.319
And the first lady
to ballard school

02:38.320 --> 02:39.912
And then, in front of the world,

02:39.920 --> 02:42.753
You will confess to the
kidnapping of those children.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.955
You will bring proof
of what you have done.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.656
You used those parents
as weapons.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.298
Now it's your turn.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.949
You will go to ballard on Sunday

02:50.970 --> 02:52.597
And you will self-destruct.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.022
You will do this,

02:54.040 --> 02:56.565
Or your daughter will die.

02:59.810 --> 03:00.959
What did
they say?

03:00.980 --> 03:03.335
What do they
want you to do?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.983
Janice, do you want
to get beth ann back?

03:11.990 --> 03:13.617
Of course.

03:13.620 --> 03:14.951
You know that I do.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.849
Then trust me.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.385
(door opens)
francis.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.160
Confess.

03:26.170 --> 03:27.899
To what?

03:27.900 --> 03:29.162
For
what?

03:29.170 --> 03:32.469
Nothing to confess.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.602
Did what I had to do.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.045
I'd do it again.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.638
Self-destruct?

03:51.990 --> 03:53.321
(groans)

04:16.280 --> 04:17.747
(phone chirps)

04:21.220 --> 04:24.280
(beeping and trilling)

04:28.860 --> 04:30.919
(audience applauding)

04:30.930 --> 04:32.921
Ballard principal:
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.636
The president and the first lady
of the United States.

04:39.470 --> 04:40.937
Mr. President.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.305
(indistinct talking)

04:49.820 --> 04:52.015
(choir singing)

05:03.800 --> 05:04.994
I called in a threat.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.467
Why haven't you shut this down?

05:06.470 --> 05:08.097
You think I want our boss
out there With gibson?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.795
Potus wants to stand
next to him

05:09.810 --> 05:12.665
And there's not a damn thing
any one of us can do about it.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.136
You put on
extra agents?

05:14.140 --> 05:16.506
Yes. Swept the
building three times.

05:16.510 --> 05:19.149
I read the reports
on mr. Gibson.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.401
Nothing's
happening in here

05:20.420 --> 05:21.819
We don't want
happening in here.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.782
No way he gets any explosive
or a gun in here.

05:25.790 --> 05:27.109
Not tonight.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.758
But, finley, this is
happening right now.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.909
I know.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.955
Look, we just
want to ask

05:31.960 --> 05:33.928
Mr. And mrs. Gibson
a few questions.

05:33.930 --> 05:36.228
Okay? We'll get them
back out there by
the end of the song.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.819
Secret service goes.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.661
Fbi, you stay here.
He'll bring 'em

05:40.670 --> 05:42.069
Back to you.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.701
We found the people
who took your daughter.

05:51.710 --> 05:52.938
They're both dead.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.770
Oh, my god.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.042
Beth ann?

05:56.050 --> 05:57.972
Still missing.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.208
Whoever took her
paid for her.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.154
Somebody bought
my daughter?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.559
I'm sorry.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.655
Why are you
looking at him?

06:06.660 --> 06:09.220
He's my husband.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.622
Have you received any calls?

06:11.630 --> 06:13.962
No.
Did your husband
receive a phone call?

06:13.970 --> 06:15.961
No.

06:15.970 --> 06:17.733
You husband knows

06:17.740 --> 06:20.004
Who has beth ann,
doesn't he, mrs. Gibson?

06:20.010 --> 06:21.898
No, how could he?

06:21.910 --> 06:24.128
Do you trust your husband?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.318
They're dead.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.981
You need to be more specific.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.083
The people who used
to work for you.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.580
Someone shot dutton,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.056
Then we shot the redhead.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.919
We are gathered here tonight
to unite in spirit.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.090
You didn't find
my daughter?

06:46.100 --> 06:48.933
My guess: Widener has her.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.738
And he's gonna use you
like you used those parents.

06:51.740 --> 06:52.832
Use you against

06:52.840 --> 06:54.262
The man who denied his pardon.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.407
My wife and I...

06:56.410 --> 06:58.605
Stand with the man
who gave us our child back.

06:58.610 --> 07:00.749
I'm sure ex-director widener

07:00.750 --> 07:02.547
Is not happy about
a long prison term.

07:02.550 --> 07:04.347
And he might have my daughter.

07:04.350 --> 07:06.409
But I'm surrounded
by secret serwce agents.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.115
What could I possibly do?

07:08.120 --> 07:11.112
You look at the president
the wrong way, I will end you.

07:13.530 --> 07:15.225
Mr. And mrs. Gibson, please...

07:15.230 --> 07:16.424
Stand with us.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.864
Side by side...
I need to go now.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.690
...To show those
who would do us harm

07:20.700 --> 07:22.338
That we are united.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.902
Thank you,
mr. President.

07:29.910 --> 07:33.698
I believe beth ann can feel
our thoughts and prayers.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.473
I want to say just one thing

07:36.490 --> 07:38.708
To the people
who have our daughter:

07:38.720 --> 07:40.608
I love beth ann,

07:40.620 --> 07:43.680
Even more so after
what we went through.

07:44.790 --> 07:47.782
But like our president,
if you call me,

07:47.800 --> 07:49.893
If you ask me to do anything...

07:52.300 --> 07:55.235
...I will say no.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.164
I love my daughter, but...

07:58.170 --> 08:02.129
I will say no.

08:03.110 --> 08:06.147
Now we light these candles...

08:06.150 --> 08:07.799
Finley...
Yeah, I know.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.243
You checked out
those candles?

08:10.250 --> 08:12.013
Those candles were
brought in by us.

08:12.020 --> 08:14.511
Francis:
...For the one _
we hope to see again.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.427
You need_to shut this down
right now.

08:20.090 --> 08:21.523
You do it or I will.

08:22.460 --> 08:33.928
Soft exfil go.
Soft exfil go.

08:33.940 --> 08:35.407
Francis:
They left in a hurry.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.609
That's too bad.

08:38.610 --> 08:41.272
They didn't have a chance
to light a candle for beth ann.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.771
I wonder
if you would.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.087
It would mean the world to me.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.027
Bill...
Hmm?

08:57.030 --> 08:58.520
Who has their
daughter?

08:58.530 --> 09:00.521
I don't know.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.236
Widener?

09:03.240 --> 09:04.730
He's fishing in montana,

09:04.740 --> 09:07.163
Surrounded by lawyers,
waiting for his trial.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.636
He's still dangerous, isn't he?

09:08.640 --> 09:10.403
Yeah.

09:10.410 --> 09:12.173
Oh, my god, that poor woman...

09:12.180 --> 09:14.068
Mrs. Gibson...

09:14.080 --> 09:17.709
Her daughter's still out there,
after all of this...

09:17.720 --> 09:19.938
And her husband, he...

09:22.420 --> 09:24.479
Honey, you all right?

09:26.760 --> 09:28.296
Bill?

09:30.360 --> 09:32.624
Is that my blood?
Julia?

09:35.870 --> 09:37.064
Julia!

09:41.080 --> 09:43.207
The first lady was just rushed
to bethesda naval hospital

09:43.210 --> 09:44.609
With what appears
to be a stroke.

09:44.610 --> 09:46.077
She's in_ critical
condition.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.843
And the president?
Kyle?

09:47.850 --> 09:49.340
They're with her.
They've both been checked out;

09:49.350 --> 09:51.238
Neither appears
to be ill.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.309
What happened
at that school?

10:04.430 --> 10:06.864
How'd you do it?

10:06.870 --> 10:08.223
Do what, agent dunn?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.299
The first lady is
in a hospital bed.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.709
How did you put her there?

10:11.710 --> 10:13.439
What do the
doctors say?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.704
A stroke.

10:15.710 --> 10:17.632
(sighs)

10:17.650 --> 10:18.969
Makes sense.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.948
The pressure
she's been under...

10:20.950 --> 10:23.544
Her son was taken all that time,

10:23.550 --> 10:25.882
Then to see him
nearly executed...

10:25.890 --> 10:29.212
The strain on that
poor woman's system...

10:29.220 --> 10:30.812
H can understand.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.650
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

10:32.660 --> 10:34.218
Why would you
say that?

10:34.230 --> 10:37.154
My daughter is missing.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.126
I sit day and night,

10:39.130 --> 10:41.064
Waiting for that terrible call.

10:41.070 --> 10:43.095
A parent has been stricken ill.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.338
Why would I enjoy that?

10:44.340 --> 10:46.308
You enjoy the attention.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.561
Being in the center of it all,

10:47.580 --> 10:50.299
_The control
it gives you.

10:51.810 --> 10:54.802
You don't want to be the bug
anymore, do you, mr. Gibson?

10:55.520 --> 10:58.489
See that, mr. Gibson?

10:58.490 --> 11:02.153
She's fbi. She's been
trained to get in your head

11:02.160 --> 11:04.788
To see
what's in there.

11:04.790 --> 11:08.021
I'm secret service.
I had a different
kind of training.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.869
(gasping)

11:13.100 --> 11:14.965
What did you do
to the first lady?

11:14.970 --> 11:19.737
I'll forgive this because you
saved my life in that fire.

11:21.340 --> 11:24.229
But don't ever touch me again.

11:33.390 --> 11:34.948
What the hell was that?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.211
I asked him to do it.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.551
You asked him to do it?

11:37.560 --> 11:39.858
To push him hard.
I had to see.

11:39.860 --> 11:42.454
In that fire when gibson asked
for my help, he'd lost control.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.620
Now he has it back.

11:43.630 --> 11:44.949
Whatever is
happening now,

11:44.970 --> 11:46.722
Francis gibson
wants it to happen.

12:32.910 --> 12:34.275
Mrs. Devore.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.941
Gibson.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.269
Thank you.

12:39.950 --> 12:42.180
Let's say that
that man in there put the

12:42.190 --> 12:43.452
First lady in the hospital.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.451
Why make flotus the target?

12:45.460 --> 12:47.018
Who benefits from her death?

12:47.030 --> 12:48.952
That's not the question
that we should be asking.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.097
What is?

12:50.100 --> 12:52.091
How does targeting
the first lady

12:52.100 --> 12:54.921
Help gibson get
his daughter back?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.089
Potus and kyle,

12:56.100 --> 12:59.103
They are still
at the hospital?
Yes.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.203
You want to question
the president?

13:01.210 --> 13:02.939
No.

13:02.940 --> 13:06.148
He wants to
question his son.

13:11.390 --> 13:14.985
(computer trilling)

13:14.990 --> 13:16.150
(beeps)

13:16.160 --> 13:18.287
(phone chirps)

13:53.030 --> 13:54.657
How's your mother doing?

13:54.660 --> 13:59.120
In surgery.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.189
There's bleeding in her brain.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.566
They're trying
to get it to stop.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.062
Why are you two here?

14:08.440 --> 14:10.271
Kyle, there's a possibility

14:10.280 --> 14:13.044
That what's happening to your
mother had an outside factor.

14:13.050 --> 14:16.349
The tv interview
you did with mr. Gibson,

14:16.350 --> 14:18.716
He whispered something
in your ear.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.017
What did he say?

14:20.020 --> 14:22.682
I told the other agents
that right after.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.851
He said we had to be
strong for beth ann.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.885
But he asked you
to do something, didn't he?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.720
Yes.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.618
And you did it...

14:30.630 --> 14:33.190
Because he saved you,
and because

14:33.200 --> 14:34.462
He's beth ann's dad.

14:34.470 --> 14:36.165
It was nothing, really.

14:36.170 --> 14:37.364
So I...

14:37.370 --> 14:39.065
What did you do, kyle?

14:39.070 --> 14:42.176
I made my parents come
to the school tonight.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.933
And you told them
it was your idea?

14:46.980 --> 14:48.345
Yes.

14:48.350 --> 14:49.817
But it wasn't, was it?

14:49.820 --> 14:53.347
He asked me to get my parents
to the vigil.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.488
To show support for beth ann.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.788
Did I do something wrong?

15:02.760 --> 15:05.149
My mother taught me
to sing "happy birthday"

15:05.170 --> 15:07.991
Twice in my head
while I'm washing my hands.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.491
To do it long enough.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.159
I taught my daughter that.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.832
He made me get my mother there.

15:16.910 --> 15:19.049
Is he the reason she's sick?

15:19.050 --> 15:21.917
Did I help him hurt my mother?

15:29.290 --> 15:31.451
(sighs) thank you.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.898
I feel refreshed now.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.562
After all, it's been
a long night.

15:39.570 --> 15:42.437
If gibson is bad...

15:42.440 --> 15:44.032
What about hurst?

15:46.540 --> 15:48.974
Hurst was pointing a gun
at gibson.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.479
Was it to protect me?

15:51.480 --> 15:56.179
Was hurst trying to protect me
when I shot him?

15:58.720 --> 15:59.982
Did I murder hurst?

15:59.990 --> 16:02.208
No. Gibson did that.

16:02.220 --> 16:03.812
Kyle, look at me.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.552
Gibson made that happen,
not you.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.369
There.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.570
Freeze it there and enhance.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.917
Your hands, mr. Gibson,

16:30.920 --> 16:33.411
You don't mind
if we swab them, do you?

16:33.420 --> 16:35.615
I can get a warrant
if I have to.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.420
I have nothing to hide.

16:47.270 --> 16:49.261
Dad?

16:57.380 --> 17:00.508
She...

17:00.520 --> 17:02.772
She loved you very much.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.488
No.

17:05.490 --> 17:06.718
I'm sorry.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.312
No.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.550
I'm sorry.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.629
Flotus has passed.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.131
I repeat:
Flotus has passed.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.141
I'll tell olsen.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.388
(phone rings)

17:42.390 --> 17:44.153
I-I guess he already knows.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.321
It's finley.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.157
I understand.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.792
We're coming in now.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.160
Finley...

17:56.170 --> 17:58.968
What?
What is it?

18:00.270 --> 18:01.760
It's amber...

18:01.780 --> 18:03.407
She's missing.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.579
The monitoring equipment
and alarms at meg's house

18:10.590 --> 18:12.080
Were disabled
from the inside.

18:12.090 --> 18:14.183
Someone who knew the codes
turned them all off.

18:14.190 --> 18:15.555
Your sister's security staff?

18:15.560 --> 18:17.312
They've all been brought in
for questioning.

18:20.230 --> 18:23.097
Meg...

18:23.100 --> 18:25.227
I was on my way to see julia,

18:25.230 --> 18:27.289
And before I even got
to the hospital,

18:27.300 --> 18:31.259
My best friend was dead
and amber was gone.

18:31.270 --> 18:34.239
It's happening again, isn't it?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.470
I don't think
it ever ended, ms. Fitch.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.277
I'm sorry,

18:38.280 --> 18:40.748
But I have to ask you,
with your daughter gone,

18:40.750 --> 18:41.899
Have you received a call?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.444
Have they asked you
to do anything?

18:43.450 --> 18:46.783
No.

18:46.790 --> 18:49.782
But I'm not the only
ballard mother in this room.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.951
Finley:
If the kidnappers knew that,
they would have

18:51.960 --> 18:53.325
Used it already.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.321
The kidnappers?

18:55.330 --> 18:58.299
We know who this is.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.689
Where is gibson, susie?

19:02.840 --> 19:04.660
Are you watching him?

19:06.840 --> 19:09.638
Would it be possible to get
something to eat?

19:09.640 --> 19:11.801
I've been here
a while. And maybe

19:11.810 --> 19:13.778
A paper to read
to pass the time?

19:13.780 --> 19:15.919
(computer trilling, beeps)

19:38.310 --> 19:40.301
It's possible
they could be lured away.
You need to keep her close.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.959
I understand you believe
your son is in his room asleep,

19:41.980 --> 19:43.277
But I need you to go in there,

19:43.280 --> 19:45.202
Turn on the light
and confirm that.

19:45.210 --> 19:47.041
I'll hold while you go do it.
As a precaution, we're asking

19:47.050 --> 19:49.518
That you don't let her out
of the house for now.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.613
No ballard kids other than amber
have been reported missing?

19:51.620 --> 19:52.985
We're still locating them all.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.981
A lot of the parents took
their kids away

19:54.990 --> 19:56.116
After they were released.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.485
How many still
unaccounted for?

19:57.490 --> 19:59.048
18 of the original kidnapped.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.119
We've just begun to check
the school at large.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.052
Over 300 students
at that high school.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.391
Amber ﬁtch swiped
her atm card

20:04.400 --> 20:05.890
At a downtown location
20 minutes ago.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.959
She took out $500.

20:07.970 --> 20:10.336
You don't take amber fitch
for $500.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.864
Pull _the bank's
surveillance tape.

20:12.710 --> 20:13.961
Dunn...

20:13.980 --> 20:17.802
Your sister in there,
is she lying about

20:17.810 --> 20:19.698
Not getting a call
from the kidnapper?

20:21.750 --> 20:23.513
No. I don't think so.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.976
But?

20:24.990 --> 20:26.480
But meg's been traumatized
by this, too.

20:26.490 --> 20:27.639
Her daughter was taken.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.686
Meg herself was
severely beaten.

20:30.690 --> 20:32.385
Sir, we weren't
close before this.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.153
I honestly have no idea

20:34.160 --> 20:35.422
What this has done
to her.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.159
Tech:
I have the atm image.

20:37.170 --> 20:38.899
That's amber.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.926
But if she's being forced
to take out money,

20:41.940 --> 20:43.862
Why is she alone?

20:43.870 --> 20:46.259
She isn't. See that shadow?

20:47.510 --> 20:49.273
Stop.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.406
Who is she with?

20:50.410 --> 20:51.900
Tech:
No way to see his face.

20:51.910 --> 20:53.969
Let it play. Let's see
what happens next.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.456
Dunn:
This isn't a kidnapping.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.382
See the way he's touching her
right there?

21:05.390 --> 21:07.927
I do. Not forced.
They know each other.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.227
Another ballard student?

21:09.230 --> 21:11.858
I don't know.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.020
Check the facebook pages
of the ballard students.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.928
They're gonna post
that they're on the run?

21:15.940 --> 21:18.090
No, I think one of their
classmates' mother just died.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.463
They'll all post condolences.

21:19.470 --> 21:21.802
Unless they're busy doing
something else.

21:21.810 --> 21:24.108
I'll start
with kyle's page.

21:24.110 --> 21:27.477
The only two who
didn't post are...

21:27.480 --> 21:29.277
Amber ﬁtch
and ian martinez.

21:31.050 --> 21:33.143
What if they weren't taken?

21:33.150 --> 21:34.549
What if they got a call?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.913
What if it's the kids

21:35.920 --> 21:37.808
Being used this time
instead of the parents?

21:37.830 --> 21:41.186
Put a bolo _out
on ian martinez.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.926
Nothing yet?
No.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.134
You texted
you got the cash, right?

21:49.140 --> 21:50.767
Yes.

21:50.770 --> 21:53.102
Amber,
beth ann's my best friend.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.999
It was easy for me
to say yes to that text.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.808
Why did you?

21:58.810 --> 22:00.903
Because...

22:00.920 --> 22:02.239
She's still out there,

22:02.250 --> 22:04.514
So it's still happening.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.380
(phone chirps)

22:09.660 --> 22:11.810
Let me see your phone.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.525
Yeah, same text.

22:14.630 --> 22:17.098
Why would they want us
to go there?

22:17.100 --> 22:19.318
(buzzing)

22:30.540 --> 22:33.373
I have a bad tooth,
so I'm gonna stick

22:33.380 --> 22:35.848
To soft foods for a while.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.016
I don't know ian martinez,

22:39.020 --> 22:41.341
And I don't know why
amber would be with him.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.453
Where is gibson?

22:43.460 --> 22:44.950
I told you, meg, we have him

22:44.960 --> 22:47.485
Here in fbi;
he's not going anywhere.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.594
Maybe amber ran away.

22:53.070 --> 22:57.029
We used to do it, too,
when it got bad at home.

22:58.670 --> 23:01.639
Things have been bad, susie.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.309
(sirens wailing distantly)

23:23.330 --> 23:25.457
What you need? (sniffs)

23:26.870 --> 23:29.998
An eighth of the mk.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.661
Mk?

23:31.670 --> 23:34.332
You sure you can handle that?

23:34.340 --> 23:37.070
Yeah, I can handle it.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.909
Where'd he go?
Do you see him?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.751
No.

23:53.030 --> 23:55.749
I'm scared.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.990
Yeah, me, too.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.023
Maybe I should get out,
go and see.
No.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.735
No.

24:03.740 --> 24:07.301
Maybe, maybe we're not going
to save beth ann.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.937
Maybe they brought us here
for something else.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.771
What should we do?

24:25.590 --> 24:27.558
Are we supposed to look inside?

24:27.560 --> 24:30.290
It didn't say.
Do it, open it.

24:30.300 --> 24:33.622
Go on.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.273
Are these to ransom beth ann?

24:44.280 --> 24:46.976
Text them and see where
we should take them.

24:46.980 --> 24:49.210
(buzzing)

25:02.460 --> 25:05.156
We just got a hit on
ian martinez's car.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.320
Is amber still with him?
No eyes on the kids yet,

25:07.340 --> 25:09.296
But the car is parked
on | street southeast.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.836
Something's happened.
Is it amber?

25:10.840 --> 25:13.104
Look, just go home
and sit tight.

25:13.110 --> 25:14.964
I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

25:14.980 --> 25:18.507
Susie, whatever she's
being made to do,

25:18.510 --> 25:21.775
You have to save her from it.

25:21.780 --> 25:24.010
(beeping)

25:34.500 --> 25:36.559
Yes, why?

25:36.560 --> 25:38.790
There's only two.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.377
You guys are open late?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.432
We never close.

25:53.410 --> 25:55.401
I need the third dressing room.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.987
Well, that's gonna cost you.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.118
(sighs)

26:05.260 --> 26:08.058
I'm supposed
to give this to you, too.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.923
Text that I gave you
the box.

26:26.450 --> 26:28.668
Ian.

26:39.630 --> 26:42.281
Radio newscaster: _
Though the white house Cited
natural causes

26:42.300 --> 26:44.427
For the death
of first lady julia devore,

26:44.430 --> 26:46.466
We now have unconfirmed reports

26:46.470 --> 26:49.769
The fbi has taken francis gibson
into custody.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.106
What if we have to stop her?

26:55.110 --> 26:56.236
Don't go there.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.639
We have aimed our guns

26:57.650 --> 26:59.800
At a lot of parents, finley.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.370
What if they're making amber
do something,

27:02.380 --> 27:05.019
And we have to stop her?

27:06.550 --> 27:07.710
I don't know no beth ann!

27:07.720 --> 27:09.483
Mace him again.

27:09.490 --> 27:11.219
Mace him again, ian!

27:16.000 --> 27:17.797
Where is she?

27:17.800 --> 27:20.121
(coughing, doorbell dings)

27:20.130 --> 27:21.597
Federal agents!

27:21.600 --> 27:22.828
Put the gun down!

27:23.900 --> 27:25.731
It's amber. Don't shoot.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.477
(buzzing)

27:31.650 --> 27:34.039
(phones ringing)

27:36.750 --> 27:38.479
You seeing this?

27:41.520 --> 27:44.353
Good news, mr. Gibson.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.749
You're getting
out of this room.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.682
Where am I going?
We're taking you somewhere

27:48.700 --> 27:50.122
To ask you some questions
in a way

27:50.130 --> 27:51.529
That we can't ask you here.

27:51.530 --> 27:54.260
Enhanced interrogation.

27:54.270 --> 27:55.862
Bingo.

27:55.870 --> 27:59.465
Turns out, we don't like people
killing the first lady.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.335
I understand.

28:01.340 --> 28:04.776
I'm ready to go.

28:06.980 --> 28:08.504
(coughing)

28:08.520 --> 28:09.873
What is going on here?

28:09.880 --> 28:11.871
He maced me,
and she took my gun!

28:11.890 --> 28:14.211
Why did you do that, amber?

28:14.220 --> 28:15.983
Can you take the mask off?

28:15.990 --> 28:19.380
No, you put these on when
you need to hurt people.

28:19.390 --> 28:21.620
What's going on in here, ian?

28:21.630 --> 28:23.029
He knows where beth ann is.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.225
We both got a text

28:25.230 --> 28:26.219
That told us to come here,

28:26.230 --> 28:28.494
And we saw those masks,

28:28.500 --> 28:30.661
And we're not _
getting taken again.

28:30.670 --> 28:32.194
We're gonna get beth ann back.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.507
Hey, I don't know no beth ann.

28:33.510 --> 28:34.863
Itold him!

28:34.880 --> 28:36.677
You need the mask, amber,

28:36.680 --> 28:39.478
So you can do what you have
to do to get beth ann back?

28:39.480 --> 28:42.244
Yes.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.068
Well, that's our job.

28:48.050 --> 28:49.881
So why don't you
give me the gun?

28:52.390 --> 28:54.324
Get down!

28:54.330 --> 28:56.696
What took you so long?!

28:56.700 --> 28:58.725
I got him.

29:01.400 --> 29:04.198
Bad tooth, it's killing me.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.689
Least of your worries.

29:05.710 --> 29:06.859
That's true.

29:06.870 --> 29:10.408
It is. Someone has my daughter.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.689
You know we're
federal agents.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.951
The best thing for you to do

29:30.970 --> 29:32.597
Is just go ahead
and put that gun down.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.465
Don't think I can do that now,

29:34.470 --> 29:36.791
This being a third strike state.

29:41.270 --> 29:43.875
Amber, there's gonna be
some shooting now.

29:43.880 --> 29:47.372
If you don't want that gun
in your hand to go off,

29:47.380 --> 29:49.007
I suggest you take your finger
off the trigger.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.049
(gunshots)

29:54.290 --> 29:56.758
(whimpering)
it's okay.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.058
Amber?

30:00.790 --> 30:02.382
I'm gonna take this now, okay?
Okay.

30:03.630 --> 30:04.995
(crying)

30:05.000 --> 30:06.797
Aunt susie,

30:06.800 --> 30:09.121
I am so sorry.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.266
It's okay, it's all right.

30:10.270 --> 30:12.807
You're all right.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.839
Can you tell me why you're here?

30:19.850 --> 30:21.147
We came to help beth ann.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.015
Help her how?

30:23.020 --> 30:25.011
We both got texts.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.749
Told us to get a box.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.240
It was filled with diamonds.

30:28.260 --> 30:31.184
Bring it here.

30:31.190 --> 30:33.420
We thought
if we did that, then...

30:33.430 --> 30:35.079
You'd help get beth ann back.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.591
Did we fail?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.997
Is she gonna die?

30:51.540 --> 30:53.371
Meg's not answering.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.200
Dunn, you need to see this.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.438
It's amber's phone.
There's a text on it

30:57.450 --> 30:58.974
Meant for that guy on the floor.

30:58.990 --> 31:02.016
"the diamonds pay to kill
the boy and hold the girl."

31:02.020 --> 31:03.453
The diamonds weren't ransom.

31:03.460 --> 31:06.054
Those masks are here

31:06.060 --> 31:08.278
Because this store
supplied gibson.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.690
He wanted amber alive to use.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.691
Puts pressure on her mother.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.065
Yeah, it does.

31:15.070 --> 31:17.391
So does killing julia devore,

31:17.400 --> 31:19.061
Meg's best friend.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.799
That puts pressure on her, too.

31:20.810 --> 31:23.734
Gibson wants something
from your sister.

31:23.740 --> 31:26.129
No.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.300
He wants someone.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.912
Finley,

31:29.920 --> 31:32.889
Meg has beth ann.

31:32.890 --> 31:35.484
(phone rings)

31:38.260 --> 31:40.558
Francis: What happened
to your friend, the first lady,

31:40.560 --> 31:42.027
Was on you.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.396
You made that happen, not me.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.563
Why would you have wanted that
to happen?

31:49.070 --> 31:53.029
When I saw you take
that bullet for lqle,

31:53.040 --> 31:55.508
I knew who you were,

31:55.510 --> 31:58.502
What you were capable of.

31:58.510 --> 32:00.603
I knew in that moment

32:00.610 --> 32:02.840
That the fbi
would never get you.

32:02.850 --> 32:05.569
So you took my daughter,
and this is what happens.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.444
You did this.

32:07.450 --> 32:10.180
You made this happen.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.748
Where did you send amber?

32:11.760 --> 32:13.125
No.

32:13.130 --> 32:16.088
Tell me that you killed
your best friend.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.022
Say it, bitch.

32:20.930 --> 32:22.932
I killed my best friend.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.794
Now you get my daughter,
bring her to me.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.368
Do it yourself.

32:26.370 --> 32:29.134
I'll call in an hour
and tell you where.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.778
Pull over.

33:22.860 --> 33:24.828
You and finley
killed those men,

33:24.830 --> 33:26.491
Aunt susie.

33:27.470 --> 33:28.994
I killed
a man, too.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.105
In that place.

33:33.110 --> 33:35.101
I didn't know.

33:35.110 --> 33:36.930
I didn't tell my mom.

33:36.940 --> 33:38.908
I couldn't.

33:40.450 --> 33:42.839
I was hoping maybe you
could tell her for me.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.111
Sure.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.941
Yeah, sure,
I-I'll tell your mother.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.482
Finley:
Dunn.

33:51.490 --> 33:52.718
Just give me one minute, okay?

33:52.730 --> 33:54.220
Sure.

33:57.630 --> 33:59.495
Did they find meg?
No.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.865
Gibson slipped
his escort.

34:00.870 --> 34:03.634
We lost him.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.701
Dunn:
What did meg say before?

34:14.710 --> 34:16.371
"we used to
do it, too.

34:18.550 --> 34:20.415
When it got
real bad at home."

34:20.420 --> 34:21.682
Dunn...

34:21.690 --> 34:22.987
Dunn!

34:22.990 --> 34:24.548
Where_are
you g0ing?

34:24.560 --> 34:26.687
I can't
tell you.
You can't tell me?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.920
Let go
of me.
What are you doing?

34:29.730 --> 34:31.721
I know where she is.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.527
I know where meg
would have put beth ann.

34:33.530 --> 34:34.519
You can call it in.

34:34.540 --> 34:35.768
No. She's doing this

34:35.770 --> 34:37.067
To get back at gibson

34:37.070 --> 34:38.332
Because of what he did to amber.

34:38.340 --> 34:39.762
Because of what he did
to all of us.

34:39.770 --> 34:41.169
Maybe that's why she did it,

34:41.180 --> 34:42.738
But we are the law,
dunn, you know that.

34:42.740 --> 34:44.605
I know we're the law,
but she's my sister

34:44.610 --> 34:46.202
And she needs me,
and I need you

34:46.210 --> 34:47.768
To turn your back and let me go.

34:47.780 --> 34:49.668
Okay, finley?
Can you do that?

34:49.680 --> 34:50.908
You know I can't.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.876
Because you're the law?
No.

34:52.890 --> 34:54.619
Because I'm your partner.

34:56.190 --> 34:57.418
You're gonna come with me?

34:57.420 --> 34:59.251
As far as you need.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.372
Dunn:
It’s Where we hid as kids...

35:17.380 --> 35:18.802
As little girls.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.368
When our parents' screaming

35:20.380 --> 35:21.904
Got too loud.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.273
It’s Where we ’0' go and pretend

35:23.280 --> 35:25.009
Everything was gonna
be a// right.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.870
I've got her!

35:51.010 --> 35:52.409
She's here!

35:52.410 --> 35:54.571
I'm going in
to get her right now.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.808
Ms. Fitch...

35:55.820 --> 35:57.811
(muffled gunshots)

36:03.290 --> 36:05.588
When did you know it was me?

36:05.590 --> 36:07.285
When I stood across from you.

36:07.290 --> 36:10.088
I didn't come to your house
to find out about widener.

36:10.100 --> 36:11.852
I came to find
out about you.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.997
Is she in there?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.537
Yes.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.963
But I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.437
Why not?

36:22.040 --> 36:23.302
I don't think you'd like

36:23.310 --> 36:24.607
What I've done to your daughter.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.134
(muffled gunshot)

36:26.150 --> 36:28.607
(groans)

36:30.850 --> 36:33.284
Bet that hurt.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.643
Now I'm gonna go in there,

36:34.660 --> 36:36.309
And if something happened
to my daughter,

36:36.320 --> 36:38.015
I'm gonna come out here
and I'm gonna run you over

36:38.030 --> 36:40.453
With your fancy car.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.361
Beth ann:
’,’oage 96.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.338
”when the president says no
to the demand,

36:50.340 --> 36:52.467
”bring ky/e into the kitchen.

36:52.470 --> 36:54.859
"after I'm shot,
free tory hurst.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.030
"set the mansion
on fire.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.736
Go through the tunnels.
Disable the mines..."

37:01.080 --> 37:02.377
This is your handwriting.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.314
I know it.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.049
16 years of birthday cards,
I know it.

37:06.050 --> 37:08.689
Beth ann, they made me
write those things.

37:08.690 --> 37:09.918
They forced me.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.148
I must be such a disappointment

37:11.160 --> 37:12.411
To you as a daughter.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.853
Why would you say that?

37:14.860 --> 37:17.226
Because I'm so stupid...

37:17.230 --> 37:19.255
To not have seen you
for what you are.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.420
They made me do
those things.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.691
To protect you.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.736
No. It was you.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.196
You took us.

37:26.210 --> 37:27.939
You killed jin liao.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.339
No one made you!

37:29.340 --> 37:30.671
No.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.432
You made all
those parents

37:32.450 --> 37:35.248
Do those horrible things.
What did you make mom do?

37:37.220 --> 37:39.472
This page doesn't
prove anything.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.383
No, it doesn't,

37:42.390 --> 37:44.551
But the gun you're
pointing at me does,

37:44.560 --> 37:46.152
Daddy.

38:07.750 --> 38:08.899
Amber...

38:08.920 --> 38:10.239
We have her.
Where's gibson?

38:10.250 --> 38:11.410
Inside.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.842
He's with
his daughter.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.318
For you.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.979
I-I took all those kids for you.

38:19.990 --> 38:21.457
I killed that boy for you,
because I love you,

38:21.460 --> 38:23.121
Because I needed
to protect you.

38:24.930 --> 38:26.295
That's what fathers do.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.325
Beth ann:
You love me?

38:28.340 --> 38:30.262
Francis:
Come on now,
it's time to go.

38:30.270 --> 38:32.568
We need to go.
No. Everything I hate
about myself is you!

38:32.570 --> 38:34.106
Francis:
I can't have this.

38:34.110 --> 38:35.463
Beth am:
I am not g0ing
anywhere with you,

38:35.480 --> 38:36.674
You freak.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.136
I can't have this!

38:38.150 --> 38:40.004
Just do it.

38:40.010 --> 38:42.808
(sniffs)
just do it.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.885
(sobs)

38:53.260 --> 38:55.148
Mr. Gibson, that's
your daughter there.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.425
So why don't you let
her come over here,

38:58.430 --> 38:59.920
Away from
that gun?

38:59.930 --> 39:01.488
Beth ann and I have to go.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.593
Put down the gun
and we'll all go.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.033
She and I...

39:05.040 --> 39:06.667
We can't be here.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.137
I have a plan.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.869
It won't hurt,
I promise.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.701
And then
it'll be over.

39:17.380 --> 39:18.677
Beth ann...

39:18.690 --> 39:21.113
Look at him.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.850
He shot that boy
in the back.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.687
He couldn't look
him in the eyes.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.953
Look at your father,
beth ann.

39:32.130 --> 39:33.597
Do it now.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.228
Good-bye.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.003
(gunshot, beth ann screams)

39:41.010 --> 39:43.433
(groaning)
it's all right.
It's all right.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.404
Francis gibson,

39:47.410 --> 39:49.640
You're under arrest.

39:49.650 --> 39:50.969
What for?

39:50.980 --> 39:52.208
For the murder of the man

39:52.220 --> 39:53.482
You killed earlier,

39:53.490 --> 39:54.912
For the shooting of my sister

39:54.920 --> 39:56.239
And the attempted murder
of your own daughter.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.080
But you're a parent.

39:58.090 --> 40:00.923
You understand why
I did what I did.

40:05.100 --> 40:06.556
Agent:
Fbi!

40:06.570 --> 40:07.867
Agent 2:
Fbi!

40:07.870 --> 40:09.667
In here!

40:21.210 --> 40:23.269
I feel your knife

40:23.280 --> 40:25.475
as it goes right in

40:29.420 --> 40:31.285
cut to my core

40:31.290 --> 40:33.656
but I'm not bleeding

40:37.460 --> 40:41.794
all that you say
trying to make me small

40:44.900 --> 40:47.903
well, the bigger you get

40:47.910 --> 40:49.639
the harder you fall

40:52.950 --> 40:56.841
you use your words
as a weapon, dear

40:59.720 --> 41:02.245
but your blades

41:02.260 --> 41:05.013
don't hurt when
you have no fear

41:09.060 --> 41:11.551
you think that you're deep

41:11.570 --> 41:13.390
under my skin

41:13.400 --> 41:15.960
you're trying to keep me

41:15.970 --> 41:18.097
suffering
you wanted me to find you.

41:18.100 --> 41:21.263
you use your words
as a weapon

41:21.270 --> 41:23.579
In case it went bad.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.434
I knew you'd come looking.

41:25.450 --> 41:28.647
It's kidnapping, meg.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.106
What you did.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.975
But you got him, susie.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.639
You got gibson.

41:37.790 --> 41:40.918
you use your words
as a weapon, dear...

41:40.930 --> 41:43.558
Last item _on
gibson's list.

41:45.300 --> 41:49.191
"my family
reunites...

41:49.200 --> 41:51.896
And I go home."

41:54.170 --> 41:55.808
you think that you're deep

41:55.810 --> 41:57.971
under my skin

41:57.980 --> 42:00.301
you're trying to keep me

42:00.310 --> 42:02.005
suffering...
I took all those kids for you.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.715
I k/i/ed that boy for you,
because I love you,

42:03.720 --> 42:06.416
Because I needed
to protect you.

42:08.850 --> 42:10.784
It’s what fathers do.

42:15.560 --> 42:18.620
I'll shed no tears.

42:18.630 --> 42:20.996
(beeping and trilling)

42:21.000 --> 42:23.730
