was made for.
-What?

00:34.495 --> 00:36.414
Freezing his backside off
in a boat?

00:36.497 --> 00:38.332
Help me, lad. Help me.

01:52.448 --> 01:54.951
You're up early.
Couldn't sleep either?

01:58.871 --> 02:01.123
Can't believe Lexie's missing
all the excitement.

02:01.207 --> 02:03.459
Is that what it is?

02:03.543 --> 02:06.004
I think perhaps
it's you that's missing her.

02:08.798 --> 02:10.966
I suppose we should welcome
the distraction.

02:13.553 --> 02:16.180
-Quite an operation.
-Mmm.

02:16.264 --> 02:17.974
Do you wish
you were part of it?

02:18.850 --> 02:21.352
-No.
-So sad.

it's a grave, Molly.

What happened, Donald?

02:28.985 --> 02:30.987
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
I can't remember.

02:31.070 --> 02:33.906
I was seven in '41.
All so long ago.

02:36.451 --> 02:38.870
I don't think
I can look at this any more.

02:38.953 --> 02:41.789
-Are you all right, Molly?
-Frogmen in the loch.

02:41.873 --> 02:43.958

I'd rather forget.

02:46.794 --> 02:49.213
How stupid of me. I'm sorry.

02:49.297 --> 02:51.090
I just hope they find
what they're looking for

02:51.174 --> 02:52.675
and we can get back to normal.

02:52.759 --> 02:55.094
Yeah, of course.
I'm sure they'll be gone soon.

03:01.059 --> 03:03.186
I suppose
it had to happen sometime.

Tell you what. Bring me back
a nice, fat salmon,
first pint's on me tonight.

03:32.298 --> 03:34.300
I'll try to contain
my excitement.

03:34.384 --> 03:35.593

I could ask a few questions.

I've had, Mr Bowman.
A chance to...

doesn't it?

No, no, don't worry.
I can fix this.

07:21.277 --> 07:23.988

you're any good at fixing
is the next drink.

I resent that.

around things mechanical.

would you have a look
at Daisy for me?

Oh, don't give it to him,
it's not his field.

07:45.385 --> 07:47.637
Course I will lass,
but I just gave it
an overhaul last week.

be the brakes.

we might have a problem.

was it,

you coming up here?

Laird of Glenbogle"
on the file,

if it was my ex-sergeant.

it's a relief to get away
from the office.

a few artefacts by the wreck.

08:34.475 --> 08:38.020
-And some bones.
-Human?

Unless they've started
awarding these
to Highland cattle.

at least.

09:04.505 --> 09:07.175
With a bit of luck,
they'll be gone in a few days.

to get on with it.

he's not daft.

And he's got Paul
in his back pocket.

09:14.349 --> 09:15.933
You should have
seen them together.

09:16.017 --> 09:20.229

It's down to me.
My responsibility.

09:20.313 --> 09:22.357
Donald, dear, you are
to responsibility

09:22.440 --> 09:24.734
what your brother was
to the concept of the new man.

09:25.735 --> 09:26.903
Do you mind?

09:26.986 --> 09:28.571
This means
a very great deal to me,

09:28.654 --> 09:30.323
and I won't have you...

09:34.827 --> 09:36.371
Am I interrupting something?

09:36.454 --> 09:39.540
No, no,
we were just talking about...

09:39.624 --> 09:40.833
Meat.

09:41.751 --> 09:42.877
Meat?

09:43.586 --> 09:44.712
Butchers.

09:45.546 --> 09:47.006
I mean, meat.

09:50.259 --> 09:54.681
Well, I'm sorry
I missed the conversation.
It sounds fascinating.

09:54.764 --> 09:56.015
Well, I just wanted
to let you know,

09:56.099 --> 09:57.725
I've invited
an old friend to stay

09:57.809 --> 09:59.268
while he's working down
at the loch.

09:59.352 --> 10:01.062
Your friend from the Ministry?

10:01.145 --> 10:03.022
Oh, news travels fast.

10:04.232 --> 10:06.192
I hope that's all right
with everyone?

10:06.275 --> 10:07.985
Of course, this is your home.

10:08.069 --> 10:09.862
That's it.

10:09.946 --> 10:12.907
We were just talking
to Ewan about what
he should cook for dinner.

10:12.990 --> 10:16.953
Wouldn't do to serve meat,
if your friend's a vegetarian.

10:17.036 --> 10:18.538
PAUL: Vegetarian?

10:18.621 --> 10:21.958
He's a soldier, Donald.
A decorated man of action.

serve him? Nut cutlets?

10:49.652 --> 10:51.946
It's so good to see you.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.073
I think I know

will you?

10:57.452 --> 10:59.370
Such a good man,

10:59.454 --> 11:03.249
and I think that
we should rally around him
in his hour of need.

11:03.332 --> 11:04.792
Yes, you're right.

What was it they used to say?

Careless talk costs lives.

11:09.464 --> 11:12.967
I've lived in this village

11:13.051 --> 11:15.178
You think you can leave
the past behind.

11:15.261 --> 11:16.679

that you can go?

-No...

11:25.438 --> 11:28.066
No, too old.
Besides, it would give
the game away, wouldn't it?

11:28.149 --> 11:31.861
-Well, at least keep
your head down.
-I don't know.

11:31.944 --> 11:35.740
-Maybe it's time
to come clean.
-You can't.

anyone in trouble.

11:41.579 --> 11:43.539

They'll look over the wreck,
make their report, and go.

it'll all be forgotten.

-Someone suggested
I talk to you.

I'll look forward to it.

you never answered

and a mug of cocoa.

13:35.985 --> 13:38.321
(SIGHS) Lighten up, will you?

13:38.404 --> 13:40.448
I mean, how long are you
going to go on moping?

13:40.531 --> 13:42.742
He's gone
and he's not coming back.

13:42.825 --> 13:45.078
Do you think Duncan's turned
into a boring old fart?

13:45.161 --> 13:47.246
-Too right he hasn't.
-Ewan!

13:47.330 --> 13:50.708
-What a horrible thing to say.
-There's a life
out there somewhere.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.460
Go and live it, will you?

13:53.294 --> 13:54.921
(LAUGHING)

13:55.380 --> 13:56.464
What?

13:56.547 --> 13:58.758
(SIGHS)

13:58.841 --> 14:01.719
It's quite hard to take you
seriously when you're waving
a fish in front of my face.

14:03.513 --> 14:06.432
Right, I've got
to wash my hair.

14:07.725 --> 14:09.769
-Shall we make it eight?
-You're on.

14:15.149 --> 14:17.402
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

14:21.948 --> 14:23.116
Molly?

14:24.742 --> 14:26.953
Molly?

14:27.036 --> 14:30.164
-(EXHALES) Checking up on me?
-Not checking...

14:30.248 --> 14:31.582
Molly? Molly!

14:33.543 --> 14:35.545
Wow.

14:35.628 --> 14:39.340
Oh, Donald,
this is our house guest,
Alex Faversham.

14:40.341 --> 14:42.385
-Ah.
-Hello.

14:42.468 --> 14:45.722
I was just saying to Alex,
you were living here in 1941.

14:45.805 --> 14:49.517
Oh! Oh, a mere lad. (CHUCKLES)

14:49.600 --> 14:51.060
It must have been
very exciting for you.

14:51.144 --> 14:54.355
Well, I was a dreamer,
didn't notice much.

14:54.439 --> 14:56.941
A plane ditches in your loch.
A man on the run.

14:57.025 --> 14:59.193
Man? What man?

14:59.277 --> 15:00.570
The one who bailed out.

15:00.653 --> 15:03.239
Look here,
are you interrogating me?

15:03.322 --> 15:05.867
Because, if so,
I demand the presence
of a lawyer.

15:05.950 --> 15:08.286
Well, with your record,
you'll know plenty.

15:10.121 --> 15:13.583
-No, no.
Just... Just chatting.
-Oh.

15:13.666 --> 15:17.128
So you don't remember
any strange Englishmen?

15:17.211 --> 15:18.504
(EXHALES)

15:18.588 --> 15:22.508
In my experience,
all Englishmen are strange.

15:22.592 --> 15:24.677
Uh, but it's not every day
you meet a Nazi.

15:24.761 --> 15:27.889
No, he wasn't... I mean,

15:27.972 --> 15:29.515
I... I didn't meet anyone.

15:32.894 --> 15:34.187
Good day.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.149
Paul.

15:39.776 --> 15:40.943
Has Doctor McKendrick
not arrived yet?

15:41.027 --> 15:42.236
No. No. What's happened?

15:42.320 --> 15:43.613
I phoned him from the hill.

15:43.696 --> 15:46.115
-(PANTING)
-Easy. Easy. Sit.

15:49.202 --> 15:50.995
A touch of heartburn.

15:51.079 --> 15:53.873
-I told you, I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

15:53.956 --> 15:59.087
Golly sounded mildly alarmed
on the phone,
so it must be really bad.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.339
Must you sound
so cheerful about it?

16:01.422 --> 16:03.132
One little dizzy spell.

16:03.216 --> 16:05.385
Molly, will you stop trying
to bully me?

16:05.468 --> 16:08.930
Your blood pressure's
190 over 80.

16:09.013 --> 16:11.349
Words, please, Gordon,
not numbers.

16:11.432 --> 16:13.976
Higher than it should be.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.063
I'm going to have to take
a wee dram
of that MacDonald blood,

16:17.146 --> 16:19.524
and check
that ticker of yours.

16:19.607 --> 16:21.943
You'd better pop into
the surgery later.

16:22.527 --> 16:23.569
I'm not ill.

16:26.155 --> 16:27.365
Am I?

16:31.452 --> 16:35.164
Well, well! Donald MacDonald!

16:35.248 --> 16:39.419
You owe me £10
from a poker game in 1959.

16:39.502 --> 16:42.547
I haven't seen you
in an agreeably long time.

16:42.630 --> 16:44.674
I've been counting the days.

16:44.757 --> 16:46.092
You look awful!

16:46.175 --> 16:48.177
-Ah.
-You've lost whatever
looks you had.

16:48.261 --> 16:50.263
Drinking too much, I suppose.

16:50.346 --> 16:54.434
And you could lose a couple
of stone without noticing it.
Now, the money.

16:54.517 --> 16:57.228
You could always
leave it to me in your will.

16:57.311 --> 16:59.564
I might be needing it soon.
Cheerio.

17:01.858 --> 17:04.152
PAUL: Donald...

17:04.234 --> 17:05.987
-What's going on?
-That man!

17:06.069 --> 17:08.531
All he's missing is
the hood and the scythe
over his shoulder.

17:08.614 --> 17:10.032
The plane.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.785
-You're hiding something.
-Whatever gave you that idea?

17:12.868 --> 17:16.580
And I'm going to find out
what it is.
One way or another.

17:16.664 --> 17:20.752
Whoa. What's it to be,
thumbscrews or the rack?

17:20.835 --> 17:22.337
(DONALD CACKLES)

17:22.420 --> 17:24.672
Paul tells me you've found
the remains of the pilot.

17:26.089 --> 17:29.302
If it's a war grave,
shouldn't it be left in peace?

17:29.385 --> 17:32.722
It will, as soon as I find out
what happened
to the other man.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.808
The other man?

17:35.892 --> 17:38.269
British spy,
working for the Nazis.

17:39.771 --> 17:42.065
Codename Tinker Bell.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.067
Obviously a fan of Peter Pan.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.443
How do you know all this?

17:45.526 --> 17:49.029
It's in the archives,
ours and the Germans.

17:49.113 --> 17:53.700
We know he was never caught,
and he didn't pop up
in Germany again.

17:53.785 --> 17:56.954
Oh, well, surely you
don't think
he's still around here?

17:58.206 --> 17:59.956
Interesting suggestion, Molly.

18:01.541 --> 18:02.627
I'd never thought of that.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.382
Some hae meat and cannae eat,

18:08.424 --> 18:10.635
but some wid eat that want it,

18:10.718 --> 18:13.137
but we hae meat
and we can eat,

18:13.221 --> 18:15.306
so, bless the Lord,
be thank it.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.643
(CLICKS TONGUE)

18:18.726 --> 18:20.353
Come now,

18:20.436 --> 18:22.730
don't look so worried.

18:22.814 --> 18:25.108
(CHUCKLES) It'll be all right.

18:25.191 --> 18:28.403
ALEX: He was a young man,
so it's possible
he could still be alive.

18:28.486 --> 18:32.990
He wouldn't be the first
traitor to change his identity
and go underground.

18:33.074 --> 18:37.245
But that wouldn't absolve him
of guilt for the deaths
of the brave men he betrayed.

18:39.789 --> 18:44.752
My own grandfather was
on a commando mission
in Norway...

18:44.836 --> 18:48.548
Which was ambushed because
a double agent gave them away.

18:50.091 --> 18:51.342
They were all murdered.

18:51.426 --> 18:53.052
Surely after
all these years...

18:53.136 --> 18:54.929
I'm not saying he'd go to
prison for the rest of
his days

18:55.013 --> 18:57.348
but those men deserve
some kind of justice,
don't you think?

19:04.022 --> 19:05.356
Sorry, Molly.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.317
No, you're quite entitled
to say what you think.

19:08.401 --> 19:10.028
If you'll excuse me,
I'd better go and see

19:10.111 --> 19:12.071
if my men
have found anything else.

19:12.947 --> 19:14.032
Thank you for dinner.

19:16.325 --> 19:17.702
I'll see you out.

They believe he's a spy.

19:36.637 --> 19:38.264
Leave him to me.

19:49.442 --> 19:52.236
Nice snake. Does it bite?

19:52.320 --> 19:54.238
Only if you get too close.

19:54.322 --> 19:55.740
Might be worth the risk.

19:55.823 --> 19:58.242
A pint of lager
and whatever you fancy.

19:59.369 --> 20:00.411
What, to drink?

20:02.121 --> 20:04.207

I don't when I'm working.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.750
How about when you're not?

20:07.043 --> 20:08.378
I'm off at ten.

Hi.

-Hey, you made it.
-Yeah, sorry, I'm late.

Same again, please.

20:35.071 --> 20:38.408
-Why, what's wrong?
-I'm really banking on this.

20:38.491 --> 20:42.245
The job's...
Not quite working out.

20:42.328 --> 20:46.040
I'm kinda drinking
in the last chance saloon.

20:46.124 --> 20:48.876
Well, in that case, I'd better
get you another, eh?

-Sorry?

21:40.053 --> 21:41.554
Well,

21:41.637 --> 21:45.475
I mean, why should it always
be old men and young girls?

21:45.558 --> 21:48.353
-Oh, no, no, we're not...
-I think you're very brave.

21:49.937 --> 21:51.606
Especially looking like that.

21:56.736 --> 21:58.988
You don't really think this
spy's still here, do you?

21:59.072 --> 22:00.406
Why not?

22:00.490 --> 22:02.075
Whatever, someone
knows something.

22:04.035 --> 22:05.828
Can't you just
lay down the law?

22:05.912 --> 22:09.540
Insist that anyone living
on your land
says what they know or else?

22:09.624 --> 22:11.459

22:11.542 --> 22:16.089
-They're not soldiers.

26:47.902 --> 26:51.030
As did this British fascist
who was spying for the Nazis.

26:51.781 --> 26:53.533
You speak German too?

26:53.616 --> 26:55.576
I spent some time there.

26:55.660 --> 26:58.454
The last war.
I was in the Air Force.

26:58.538 --> 26:59.706
On which side?

27:01.207 --> 27:03.292
Tell me, why are you here?

27:04.419 --> 27:05.461
I know.

27:06.629 --> 27:10.216
Can't prove it, but I know.

27:10.299 --> 27:13.344
And I think
you should come clean.
Otherwise, other people...

27:13.428 --> 27:16.180
Friends of mine and yours...

27:16.264 --> 27:18.016
Are gonna get into
a lot of trouble.

27:18.099 --> 27:20.309
-Anything else?
-Yeah.

27:24.522 --> 27:26.441
I'll have some of your
delicious liver sausage.

27:28.526 --> 27:30.778
You must tell me where you
learnt to make it.

27:30.862 --> 27:32.447
One day, Paul,

27:33.239 --> 27:34.490
perhaps.

27:38.703 --> 27:40.413
(WOLF WHISTLES)

27:41.247 --> 27:42.749
Check the pecs.

27:44.292 --> 27:45.668
Hiya.

27:45.752 --> 27:48.504
-Are you like that all over?
-I can cook, too.

27:48.588 --> 27:51.466
When are you going
to cook something for me?

27:51.549 --> 27:53.384
I'm always up for something...

27:54.177 --> 27:55.345
Spicy.

27:57.347 --> 27:59.265
So, he cooks,

27:59.349 --> 28:00.641
he's, uh, fit...

28:02.143 --> 28:03.436
But can he sing?

28:03.519 --> 28:05.563
Watch me win the karaoke.

28:05.646 --> 28:08.149
Well, you might
if we do it together.

28:08.941 --> 28:10.318
Oh, aye...

28:12.195 --> 28:13.696
Oh, no. Jess...

28:13.780 --> 28:16.866
Of course, we'd have to put in
some practise round my place.

28:18.159 --> 28:19.744
Run through a few moves.

28:20.536 --> 28:21.913
Make, um...

28:22.789 --> 28:24.374
Sweet music together.

28:28.044 --> 28:29.087
Cool.

You can drop the act.

28:52.652 --> 28:54.570
I know what's going on.

28:54.654 --> 28:57.782
-I wish I did.
-Why didn't you tell me?

28:57.865 --> 29:00.118
(SIGHS) Why do you think,
Sergeant Bowman?

29:00.201 --> 29:01.285
Not any more.

29:01.369 --> 29:03.204
Oh, come off it, Paul.

29:03.287 --> 29:05.206
You've been doffing your
cap ever since your
friend arrived.

29:05.289 --> 29:06.916
-I should have been told.
-(SIGHS)

29:07.000 --> 29:09.752
I'm trying to protect
an innocent man.

29:09.836 --> 29:11.337
I know where my loyalties lie.

29:11.963 --> 29:13.047
How about you?

29:15.008 --> 29:16.926
So, how have you been?

29:17.010 --> 29:19.095
Not so good.

29:19.178 --> 29:22.515
Just staring out
of the window, waiting.

29:22.598 --> 29:25.393
Not cycled up
any mountains, then?

29:25.476 --> 29:27.437
What?
A frail old thing like me?

29:27.520 --> 29:30.231
(CHUCKLES) You'll see me out,
Molly MacDonald.

29:32.108 --> 29:34.944
But you've seen
the ECG results yourself.

29:36.362 --> 29:38.364
We're going to have
to take care of you.

29:42.201 --> 29:44.370
How can you be so sure
he's innocent?

29:44.454 --> 29:48.124
-My gran was an impeccable
judge of character.
-Your gran?

29:48.207 --> 29:49.917
Yeah, she helped him.

29:50.001 --> 29:51.169
-She believed in him.
-Ha!

29:51.252 --> 29:53.755
But what if Mr Taylor
managed to fool her?

29:53.838 --> 29:56.591
-He'd have to be
a damn good actor.
-Spies usually are.

29:56.674 --> 29:58.801
Maybe that's why
he's survived for so long.

30:00.595 --> 30:02.680
Alex won't give up
until he gets a result.

30:02.764 --> 30:05.016
I won't believe
that my godfather is a spy.

30:05.099 --> 30:08.102
-Your godfather?
-There you are.

30:08.186 --> 30:12.273
-How are things going?
Got anywhere yet?
-Maybe.

30:12.357 --> 30:15.276
People are always happy
to talk to Paul.
They trust him.

30:17.904 --> 30:20.656
Let's just see how things
stand at the end of the day.

30:20.740 --> 30:22.200
In other words,
you've got nothing.

30:23.201 --> 30:24.660
Ah, well, I need to push on.

30:24.744 --> 30:26.496
The boss is breathing down
my neck.

and I'm running out of both.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.627
Oh...

30:32.710 --> 30:34.629
I'm still good
for that 50, though.

30:37.006 --> 30:38.216
Fifty?

30:39.717 --> 30:41.219
Anyway, thanks
for not saying anything.

30:41.302 --> 30:44.389
I think it's best for everyone
if Irvine tells the truth.

30:46.224 --> 30:49.560
Now, if he doesn't come
clean to Alex, I will.

30:49.644 --> 30:50.770
He's got until
tomorrow morning.

31:03.324 --> 31:04.951
Well?

31:05.034 --> 31:08.037
As I guessed,
clean bill of health.

31:08.121 --> 31:10.289
That's a great relief, Molly.

31:10.373 --> 31:12.000
So, that's that.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.547
This has been hard on you,
hasn't it?

31:17.630 --> 31:21.175
Oh, it's part of my life.

31:21.259 --> 31:23.594
I thought it was dead
and buried.

31:25.138 --> 31:29.726
When I saw that plane
rise up out of the water,

31:29.809 --> 31:32.311
so many bad memories came too.

31:32.395 --> 31:35.523
I wish it would
sink back into the mud
and take them with it.

to the bother.
-We want to win, don't we?

-What?

I can't do it.

32:31.371 --> 32:32.622
(CHUCKLES) What do you mean?

32:35.625 --> 32:37.418
I've told Zoe
I'll sing with her.

32:38.753 --> 32:40.254
Oh.

32:40.338 --> 32:42.757
I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea,
you know.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.259
She just came over
and, you know, she just...

It's fine. It's fine.

32:59.899 --> 33:01.442

33:02.652 --> 33:06.572
Yes. My late brother
had his faults,

33:06.656 --> 33:09.283
but at least he always kept
a pretty fine cellar.

33:11.411 --> 33:13.913
-Well, things to do...
-What about your faults?

You think a senior
MoD official can't get access
to the police computer?

33:33.516 --> 33:36.561
You have infringed
the Data Protection Act.

33:37.687 --> 33:39.522
An order can be lifted,
you know.

33:41.566 --> 33:43.484
If it's clearly
in the national interest.

Oh!

then base inducements.

to stand there,

she told you.

Well, lady's prerogative,
I suppose.

I dropped by.

-They should be on a charge.

It only happened because
you tried to sabotage
an MoD operation.

41:33.788 --> 41:35.415
You're damned lucky
I don't report you!

41:35.498 --> 41:37.834
I'm not in the Army any more,
Alex, and neither are you!

41:39.335 --> 41:41.212
I have to say,
I feel badly let down by you.

41:43.172 --> 41:44.382
After all I did for you.

41:45.675 --> 41:47.677
I'll never forget it,

41:47.760 --> 41:49.262
but I've got
other obligations now.

41:49.345 --> 41:52.223
-So it would seem.
-I understand
what you're doing.

41:52.306 --> 41:54.434
You're trying to prove
something mostly to yourself.

41:54.517 --> 41:57.145
-What do you mean?
-But I think you may be wrong.

41:57.228 --> 41:59.731
-If you'd let me help.
-Help?

41:59.814 --> 42:02.567
You've done nothing
but obstruct me
since the moment I arrived.

42:02.650 --> 42:03.985
Hear, hear!

42:04.068 --> 42:07.405
Everyone's clammed up,
like they're scared to speak.

42:07.488 --> 42:10.074
What are you?
Laird or a mafia don?

42:11.325 --> 42:15.079
She's right.
My men got nowhere.

42:15.163 --> 42:17.290
The village has taken
a vow of silence.

42:17.373 --> 42:20.752
Maybe I could shed
a little light on all this.

42:24.005 --> 42:26.466
Unteroffizier Erwin Schneider.

42:27.592 --> 42:29.844
Now, if you'll permit me,

42:29.927 --> 42:32.180
I'd like to set
the record straight.

42:43.983 --> 42:45.943
Sixty years ago,

42:46.027 --> 42:49.322
I was the pilot
of this plane here.

42:49.405 --> 42:53.701
Then, how do you explain
the bones and remnants
of a pilot's uniform?

42:53.785 --> 42:57.121
I had a passenger.
A very important man.

42:57.205 --> 42:59.916
I gave him my flying jacket.

42:59.999 --> 43:03.920
-Did you, now?
-It was so cold in the plane.

43:04.003 --> 43:07.799
We were heading for
the west of Scotland under
the cover of darkness.

43:07.882 --> 43:10.051
He was going to jump
north of Glasgow.

43:11.511 --> 43:14.389
(SIGHS) Well, I lost my way

43:14.472 --> 43:18.893
and hit the coast, slap-bang
over Dundee with all its guns.

43:18.976 --> 43:20.853
We were hit, he was injured,

43:20.937 --> 43:23.731
and we lost an engine
from the starboard wing.

43:26.025 --> 43:30.279
We were finished,
so when I spotted the water
I told him to jump.

43:30.363 --> 43:35.159
I opened the canopy
but he couldn't make it.

43:35.243 --> 43:38.413
When I was floating down
to Earth,

43:38.496 --> 43:40.998
my plane hit the water.
It was terrible.

43:41.082 --> 43:42.166
What happened?

43:42.250 --> 43:44.252
I sheltered in the woods.

43:44.335 --> 43:49.257
And early the next morning,
I came to a clearing
near a waterfall

43:49.340 --> 43:52.760
and a few feet away
I saw the body of a boy.

43:54.053 --> 43:56.014
And my old life ended.

44:00.268 --> 44:01.978
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

44:02.061 --> 44:04.605
His face was so cold.

44:04.689 --> 44:06.024
I thought he was dead.

44:06.774 --> 44:08.151
But I wasn't.

44:08.234 --> 44:09.736
(SCOFFS)

44:09.819 --> 44:13.239
-You?
-I'd had an argument
with my father the day before.

44:14.365 --> 44:17.660
Ran away, broke my ankle,

44:17.744 --> 44:20.288
couldn't move.
(CHUCKLES) Foolish boy.

44:20.371 --> 44:22.582
So, I had a dilemma.

44:22.665 --> 44:27.045
-I carried him for miles.
-(SPEAKING GERMAN)

44:27.128 --> 44:30.381
Then I saw the big house
and screamed for help.

44:34.218 --> 44:36.846
I didn't know what was going
to happen to me.

44:39.599 --> 44:42.268
I was scared and wanted to run

44:43.269 --> 44:45.146
but I was exhausted.

44:46.939 --> 44:50.234
Then the laird took me
into the house.

44:50.318 --> 44:52.362
You saved my life.

44:52.445 --> 44:54.781
Not that I can say,
I've done a great deal
with it...

44:54.864 --> 44:57.992
Oh, I wouldn't say that,
we're all very fond of you.

44:59.660 --> 45:02.455
-Are you?
-Well, up to a point.

45:02.538 --> 45:05.208
I wouldn't have had it
any other way.

45:05.291 --> 45:08.795
I've had such
a happy life here.

45:08.878 --> 45:10.546
You could have been hung
as a spy.

45:12.131 --> 45:14.050
And the villagers
didn't give you up?

45:14.133 --> 45:17.011
Oh, a few of them wanted me
handed over,

45:17.095 --> 45:20.640
but the laird and his wife
talked them round.

45:20.723 --> 45:23.476
Isobel's grandmother
was a great help.

45:23.559 --> 45:24.894
How was that?

45:24.977 --> 45:28.981
I was put under
a sort of house arrest
at Kate's farm,

45:29.065 --> 45:32.902
to work as a kind of
unofficial prisoner of war.

45:32.985 --> 45:36.948
Now, if I had attempted
to escape, she would have
got the blame.

45:37.031 --> 45:39.534
So, as far as I'm concerned,
she's the hero.

45:41.494 --> 45:44.414
So, that's your
Messerschmitt 109?

45:44.497 --> 45:47.792
Actually it's a 110 mark F.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.877
Not so fast as a 109

45:49.961 --> 45:51.963
but twice the range.

45:52.046 --> 45:56.259
Would you like me to tell you
about the Daimler-Benz
inverted V12 engines?

45:56.342 --> 45:57.510
(LAUGHS)

46:00.304 --> 46:01.597
So, what happens now?

46:04.559 --> 46:06.144
Soldiers have to make choices.

46:07.729 --> 46:09.814
Sometimes they involve
the lives of other people.

46:11.983 --> 46:13.860
I salute this man
for what he did.

46:16.029 --> 46:17.447
Just as I salute you.

46:22.827 --> 46:24.579
I came here to do a job, Paul.

46:26.873 --> 46:29.500
That's what I signed up for,
my duty.

46:29.584 --> 46:33.212
-Can't it just end here?
-PAUL: He's an old man, Alex,

46:34.172 --> 46:35.298
and a good one.

46:38.217 --> 46:41.346
Your duty is to do
what's right.

46:45.391 --> 46:49.187
And you will be throwing
a man to the lions
if you publish this.

46:49.270 --> 46:51.105
This is the story
of a lifetime.

46:52.023 --> 46:53.608
It would make the nationals...

46:56.319 --> 46:58.905
-And my career.
-And destroy a man,

46:58.988 --> 47:02.075
his family and a community.

47:07.663 --> 47:08.831
Can you live with that?

47:13.002 --> 47:16.047
-Stop looking at me like that.
-PAUL: The ball's
in your court.

47:17.632 --> 47:19.050
If you keep schtum...

47:22.136 --> 47:23.471
Don't do this to me.

47:25.598 --> 47:26.808
Please?

47:41.197 --> 47:42.240
Good for you.

47:44.909 --> 47:45.993
(CHUCKLES)

47:53.376 --> 47:54.460
(ENGINE STOPS)

47:58.715 --> 48:03.553
This is kind of you, Golly,
but it's not quite the same
as cycling down.

48:08.516 --> 48:10.601
(GASPS) Daisy!

48:10.685 --> 48:13.688
But you know what
the doctor said.

48:13.771 --> 48:16.190
He said
don't overtax yourself.

48:16.274 --> 48:18.484
He didn't say anything
about you not going downhill.

48:18.568 --> 48:19.652
(SIGHS)

48:21.237 --> 48:23.573
-Give me a push, then.
-Certainly.

48:23.656 --> 48:25.158
-Ah-ha!
-There you go.

48:25.241 --> 48:26.409
Whee!

48:27.452 --> 48:28.953
Whee!

48:37.337 --> 48:39.839
My godfather says
you'll make a good laird.

48:39.922 --> 48:41.215
What do you say?

48:42.300 --> 48:43.509
-Cheers.
-(DOOR OPENS)

48:44.594 --> 48:46.262
I owe you an apology.

48:47.180 --> 48:48.723
You were just doing your job.

48:48.806 --> 48:50.141
Oh, no. Thank you.

48:50.224 --> 48:52.685
Yeah, well, I may not be doing
that for much longer.

48:52.769 --> 48:54.562
What's that?

48:54.645 --> 48:57.315
I think my days at the MoD
are coming to an end.

48:58.107 --> 48:59.901
Because of this?

48:59.984 --> 49:02.236
It's time for a change.
Fresh start.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.488
I've been there myself.

49:04.906 --> 49:07.241
-What did you do?
-I came up here.

49:07.325 --> 49:08.701
PAUL: That's an idea.

49:08.785 --> 49:10.411
Why don't you stay here
while you sort things out?

49:12.080 --> 49:14.040
-Well, I...
-Yeah, you should.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.209
Should I?

49:21.798 --> 49:24.258
(MUSIC PLAYING)

49:24.342 --> 49:25.385
How you doing?

49:25.468 --> 49:27.303
Good evening everybody.

49:28.304 --> 49:29.514
Hi there, how you doing?

49:29.597 --> 49:31.724
Evening.
Uh, two bottles of beer,

49:31.808 --> 49:33.101

(GIGGLING)

50:05.258 --> 50:08.886
If I go back with nothing,
I'll be signing on next week.

50:08.970 --> 50:13.057
I don't suppose
you'd be interested
in an exclusive profile

50:13.141 --> 50:18.146
of a veteran Formula One
driver recently retired
to a country seat?

50:18.229 --> 50:19.439
Do you know one?

50:19.522 --> 50:21.566
As long as there
a few shillings in it for me.

50:21.649 --> 50:24.402
You're talking to
the Flying Scotsman.

50:24.485 --> 50:25.903
Sounds interesting.

50:27.196 --> 50:28.656
Are you still driving then?

50:28.740 --> 50:33.119
Sadly not. A few problems with
Mr Dee-dah, Dee-dah of late.

50:33.202 --> 50:34.328
Yeah?

50:34.412 --> 50:37.790

50:37.874 --> 50:39.542
-That's a good story.
-Excuse me.
