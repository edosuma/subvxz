00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.108
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.342 --> 00:09.710
sexually based offenses

00:09.710 --> 00:12.046
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.448
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.448 --> 00:16.317
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.317 --> 00:17.751
are members of an elite squad

00:17.751 --> 00:19.887
known as the
Special Victims Unit.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.323
These are their stories.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.160
- Alvin's spread in
"Vanity Fair" was awesome.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.162
I've had it on my Pinterest
since it came out.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.998
- [chuckles]
Alvin is the best.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.833
You can change
in here, Sally.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.836
[pop music]

00:35.836 --> 00:38.806
*

00:38.806 --> 00:40.141
- Can I call Matt?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.842
He usually likes
to be with me.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.944
- Alvin doesn't like
boyfriends or managers around.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.146
It keeps it more intimate.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.381
- Okay.

00:47.381 --> 00:54.422
*

00:54.422 --> 00:55.789
[door clicks]

00:55.789 --> 00:59.193
- Hello, gorgeous.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.894
Today,

01:00.894 --> 01:02.930
we are gonna make magic.

01:02.930 --> 01:09.203
*

01:09.203 --> 01:11.505
- Are we really doing this?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.774
I have, like, 500 shots
on my phone.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.309
- Well, you can text those,
but you need

01:15.309 --> 01:16.477
some that you can frame.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.878
- Yeah, plus this light,
Rollins,

01:17.878 --> 01:19.180
you can't beat magic hour.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.814
- Listen to him.
He gets a camera,

01:20.814 --> 01:22.049
and all of a sudden,
he's a professional.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.417
- Hey, you saw those shots
I took of my niece.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.286
- All right,
you say magic hour,

01:25.286 --> 01:26.820
I say witching hour.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.921
I've got, like, ten minutes.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.357
[bell rings]
- Hold on, sweetie, okay?

01:29.357 --> 01:30.791
All right, baby,
here we go.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.626
Here we go.
Hold on, sweetie boy.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.528
Hold on. Ready?
Yeah.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.964
- Oh, Lou, Lou,
that's--

01:36.964 --> 01:38.499
That's incredible.
[camera shutter clicking]

01:38.499 --> 01:40.901
There you go.
Hey, Jesse, right here.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.303
[camera shutter clicking]

01:42.303 --> 01:43.837
- That's it.
You know you want it.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.473
Oh, beautiful.
All right.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.574
Gorgeous!

01:46.574 --> 01:47.908
That is hot.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.577
That is sexy.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.645
Move to your right a little bit.
Good, baby, good.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.447
Okay, good, good.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.815
Get down, yeah.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.450
That's it.
Lick your lips.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.752
Wet, I want it wet.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.254
Baby, give it to me!

02:00.254 --> 02:01.355
I love it!

02:01.355 --> 02:02.556
Come on, this down--

02:02.556 --> 02:04.057
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Don't--

02:04.057 --> 02:05.393
- * And do what you want

02:05.393 --> 02:07.094
- I'm trying to get something.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.896
- * Do what you want,
what you want with my body *

02:08.896 --> 02:10.864
- I'm gonna go change lenses.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.601
Nora!

02:13.601 --> 02:15.236
Get her to chill.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.870
- * That I'm not sorry

02:16.870 --> 02:19.540
* Do what you want,
what you want with my body *

02:19.540 --> 02:22.510
- He's intense,
but it's worth it.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.379
- I just haven't done shoots
like this before.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.415
- Well, you're fresh,

02:27.415 --> 02:30.218
and that's why he's
really responding to you.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.686
If Alvin is into you...

02:32.686 --> 02:33.987
[whispers]
Then it's all good.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.856
- * You don't own my life

02:35.856 --> 02:39.126
* But do what you want
with my body *

02:39.126 --> 02:40.528
- Give it to me.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.529
Give it to me!

02:41.529 --> 02:43.063
- Wait, wait.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.698
- Just take it...

02:44.698 --> 02:46.400
[grunting]
My little girl.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.068
[moaning]

02:48.068 --> 02:50.238
- [crying]
- [moaning]

02:50.238 --> 02:52.139
[moans]

02:52.139 --> 02:54.342
[ominous music]

02:54.342 --> 02:55.443
That was amazing.

02:55.443 --> 02:59.146
- [crying]

02:59.146 --> 03:02.250
- That worked.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.617
Did you get all of it?

03:03.617 --> 03:07.955
*

03:07.955 --> 03:10.157
Oh, good stuff.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.992
Go--go clean her up.

03:11.992 --> 03:19.500
*

03:19.500 --> 03:21.869
- I didn't want him to do that.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.305
- That's not what
the camera saw.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.539
*

03:25.539 --> 03:28.542
- [crying]

03:28.542 --> 03:30.544
*

03:30.544 --> 03:31.612
[phone ringing]
- Whoa!

03:31.612 --> 03:33.547
- Yeah. Benson.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.385
A 17-year-old girl?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.520
Okay, is she in
with the nurse now?

03:41.154 --> 03:44.358
Okay, see you
in about 30 minutes.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.727
- So much for magic hour.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.500
- I was in
Alvin Gilbert's loft.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.002
He was taking pictures,

03:55.002 --> 03:57.104
and then he asked me
to take off my top,

03:57.104 --> 04:00.808
started touching me,
and then he pushed me

04:00.808 --> 04:02.976
down to the floor.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.745
- Okay,
and then what happened?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.381
- I was begging him.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.551
I said, "Please,
don't do this to me,"

04:10.551 --> 04:11.985
and that's when
he handed the camera

04:11.985 --> 04:13.787
to Nora, his assistant.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.356
- Hold up.
His assistant was there?

04:15.356 --> 04:17.458
Okay, did she see
the assault?

04:17.458 --> 04:18.659
- Yes.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.361
She was taking pictures.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.830
- She took pictures
of the rape?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.765
- Rape?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.000
- Yes, Sally, rape.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.002
That's what we could be
charging him with.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.439
- Charges?

04:31.439 --> 04:33.774
Please, I don't know
if I want to press charges.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.010
*

04:37.010 --> 04:39.079
My boyfriend, Matt, he doesn't
know that I was there,

04:39.079 --> 04:42.049
and if he finds out,
he will kill me.

04:42.049 --> 04:46.687
*

04:46.687 --> 04:49.690
[dramatic music]

05:33.434 --> 05:33.567
.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.202
- How was the training
at Quantico?

05:36.404 --> 05:37.771
- I can neither confirm
nor deny I was there.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.172
- Okay.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.674
- Sorry I left you guys
in the lurch.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.809
- We managed.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.611
- You caught a case
last night?

05:43.611 --> 05:45.579
- Yeah, Sally Landry, 17.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.047
She was reluctant
to press charges,

05:47.047 --> 05:48.616
but we convinced her
to come in.

05:48.616 --> 05:49.750
- She's an aspiring model.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.452
She is fresh off the bus
from Iowa.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.786
She's here for Fashion Week.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.287
- Fashion week--I hate it.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.723
- Yeah, me too.
A nonstop gridlock.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.791
- Anyway,
Sally was raped

05:57.791 --> 06:00.961
by Alvin Gilbert
in his studio yesterday.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.830
- Alvin Gilbert
the fashion designer?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.898
- No, that's--that's
his older brother, Benno.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.734
Alvin is the bad boy
photographer that does

06:06.734 --> 06:08.869
all their photo shoots,
campaign design.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.438
- A real bad boy--
me and Munch

06:10.438 --> 06:12.205
caught that case
12 years ago.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.441
- Really, what happened?

06:13.441 --> 06:15.308
- Some big-time Italian model

06:15.308 --> 06:17.110
got assaulted during a shoot.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.446
While we were
investigating,

06:18.446 --> 06:21.014
she becomes the face
of their new perfume.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.516
- Hmm.
- Case goes away.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.084
- I'm not sure
this one will.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.619
Sally's green,
she's very upset,

06:25.619 --> 06:28.756
and Alvin's assistant,
Nora Wattan,

06:28.756 --> 06:31.459
may have taken pictures
of the assault.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.360
- So the rape kit
did come back positive

06:33.360 --> 06:35.529
for semen, so we're
running it now for DNA.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.164
- And Sally's blood
alcohol was high

06:37.164 --> 06:39.633
because Nora was
feeding her drinks.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.368
- Do the Gilberts know
that she disclosed?

06:41.368 --> 06:42.470
- Oh, I doubt it.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.571
As of last night,
she didn't even want

06:43.571 --> 06:44.805
her boyfriend to know.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.907
- Let me
do the talking.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.809
[whispers indistinctly]

06:48.809 --> 06:51.044
- Is that her?
- Yep, from that

06:51.044 --> 06:52.580
choke hold that guy's
got on her,

06:52.580 --> 06:54.648
I'm guessing he knows.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.649
- Sally.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.551
Hey, how you doing today?

06:57.551 --> 06:58.586
- Okay.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.087
This is my boyfriend,
Matt.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.354
- Lieutenant Benson.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.490
- Matt Kroger,

07:02.490 --> 07:04.124
boyfriend and manager.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.226
I warned Sally
about this Gilbert creep.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.128
- Uh, okay, Mr. Kroger.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.830
Um...

07:09.830 --> 07:11.665
Right now, we need
to speak with Sally.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.133
- That's why I'm here.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.167
Let's do this.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.603
- You know what?
She'll be okay.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.905
Why don't you come with me
and Detective Carisi?

07:17.905 --> 07:20.708
- Yeah, just come for a minute.
It's fine.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.009
- Okay.
- Talk to us

07:22.009 --> 07:23.176
about this piece of crap.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.847
- We're just gonna go
in this room right here.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.182
- I had to tell Matt.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.852
When I came home, he could tell
that something was wrong.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.220
- And how'd he handle it?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.522
- Matt's angry,

07:34.522 --> 07:36.189
not at me,

07:36.189 --> 07:37.858
at Alvin.

07:37.858 --> 07:41.595
- Yeah, Sally,
that bruise under your eye,

07:41.595 --> 07:43.531
that--that wasn't there
last night.

07:43.531 --> 07:47.801
- Well, um, that must be
from the assault.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.904
- But you were worried
about how Matt would react.

07:50.904 --> 07:55.609
- No, Matt has been
very understanding.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.344
- Okay.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.680
And have you called anyone
from your family?

07:59.680 --> 08:03.283
- I don't really
talk to them anymore.

08:03.283 --> 08:07.354
- Um, well, Sally,
we have to ask you.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.456
You're new, right,
in the business?

08:09.456 --> 08:12.893
And Alvin's a pretty
famous photographer.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.028
- Is there anything
that may have happened

08:15.028 --> 08:19.466
that you didn't want to tell us
or didn't want to tell Matt?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.673
- Wait, you guys think
I'm making this up?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.975
I-I-I wouldn't.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.678
Alvin Gilbert raped me.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.145
- Just a question, Sally.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.582
We just have to ask.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.584
- I discovered Sally
in Dubuque,

08:36.584 --> 08:39.019
behind the counter
at Cold Stone Creamery.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.020
I got her pictures.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.188
I made the connects.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.623
I go with her to every gig

08:42.623 --> 08:45.025
until this guy Alvin
cuts me out.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.960
- That's tough.
- No, she's too trusting.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.963
And I've spoken to her
about this.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.632
Be that as it may,

08:51.632 --> 08:54.167
I can't guard her 24-7.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.736
- No, of course not.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.170
- So you know,

08:57.170 --> 08:59.206
Alvin is not gonna
get away with this.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.340
- Well, we're gonna do
everything we can--

09:00.340 --> 09:02.776
- No, I mean no matter what.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.478
If you don't take care
of him, I will.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.048
[tense music]

09:08.048 --> 09:10.150
- And Nora brought you
another drink,

09:10.150 --> 09:12.620
and then Alvin
resumed shooting?

09:12.620 --> 09:15.388
- Yeah.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.391
That's when he started to get
really physical with me,

09:18.391 --> 09:21.094
and then he got on top of me,

09:21.094 --> 09:22.663
and I was struggling,
saying, "Wait."

09:22.663 --> 09:24.998
- Hold on, and Nora's
still shooting?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.000
- Yes.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.302
I was fighting
to get him off of me,

09:29.302 --> 09:32.105
and she just kept saying
how hot I looked.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.108
[knocks]

09:35.108 --> 09:37.845
- Uh, excuse me
one moment, Sally.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.914
*

09:40.914 --> 09:42.015
Hey, you got something?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.550
- I ran Matt Kroger
through the system.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.285
Domestic violence,
assault charges.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.486
- Why am I not surprised?

09:46.486 --> 09:47.921
- Look, I know
we're supposed to take

09:47.921 --> 09:49.556
every vic's story
at face value,

09:49.556 --> 09:51.324
but what if this gets spun

09:51.324 --> 09:54.027
that Sally consented with
Alvin to help her career?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.797
- And she's claiming rape
to avoid a beatdown from Matt?

09:56.797 --> 09:59.266
- Yeah.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.168
- That's why we need
a controlled meet.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.004
- With Alvin?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.806
He just assaulted her.
You think she can handle that?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.307
- No.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.109
No, I don't.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.778
*

10:12.780 --> 10:15.448
- What happened
in Alvin's studio,

10:15.448 --> 10:17.017
it wasn't right.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.353
- Morning-after regret.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.622
Don't.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.825
You're gonna get
a lot of work from this.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.227
Alvin is definitely
gonna use you.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.662
- He forced me.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.163
He didn't use a condom.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.665
- What are you saying
here, Sally?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.967
- I'm worried that
I might be pregnant.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.838
- If you are, Alvin
will take care of it.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.206
Is this a shakedown?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.974
- No.
- Because if you're gonna

10:40.974 --> 10:43.210
take on the House of Gilbert,

10:43.210 --> 10:44.511
your career's over.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.113
- My career?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.881
What about those photos
that you took?

10:47.881 --> 10:50.517
What happens if those wind up
all over the Internet?

10:50.517 --> 10:51.885
- Relax.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.286
They're not even
on the computer.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.922
They're on a separate SD card.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.556
- That's enough for a warrant.

10:56.556 --> 10:59.059
- Yep, I'll call Barba.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.828
[tense music]

11:00.828 --> 11:02.029
- Okay,
now put your head down,

11:02.029 --> 11:03.630
and your eyes look
right into the lens,

11:03.630 --> 11:04.832
right into the lens.

11:04.832 --> 11:05.966
Oh, that's sexy.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.567
- Is that art or porn?

11:07.567 --> 11:08.836
- Depends on how much
you pay for it.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.570
- We're in a session.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.972
- That's good.
That means Alvin is here.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.506
- Wait, you can't just
come in here.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.743
- We can get a little
more detail on the dress, Alvin.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.944
- Sir.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.779
- Excuse me.
We're working here.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.013
- SVU.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.348
We're executing
a search warrant

11:21.348 --> 11:22.983
for the Alvin Gilbert studio.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.618
- My name is Benno Gilbert.
I'm his brother.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.619
- What the hell's going on?

11:26.619 --> 11:27.788
- All right, SD cards,

11:27.788 --> 11:29.122
computers,
external drives.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.258
- Why don't we take five,
folks?

11:31.258 --> 11:33.360
- What's this about?

11:33.360 --> 11:36.764
- A young model claims
that Alvin raped her.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.832
- Sally?
That little bitch.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.833
She's lying.
- Alvin--

11:39.833 --> 11:41.301
- Officers,
this has to wait.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.469
We're prepping our show.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.437
We have an IPO looming.
These are our investors.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.873
- Ma'am, that's none
of our concern.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.207
- Claire, please.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.942
Look, we agree
to cooperate fully

11:48.942 --> 11:50.443
if you just let us
finish our work.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.379
- She tried to shake down
my assistant.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.147
- Okay, is that the camera that
you used to shoot Sally?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.315
- Yeah, it's on the list.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.549
- Get your hands
off my camera.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.650
Do not touch my camera!

11:57.650 --> 11:58.786
- Hey!
- Do not touch--

11:58.786 --> 11:59.953
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.454
- Hey, hey, hey, Benno!
He's breaking my arm.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.990
- He's an artist.
Let him go.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.624
- He's resisting arrest.
- That's not what I'm doing.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.993
- All right, let him go.
You're hurting him.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.694
- Hey, you need to stop
talking now, or you're

12:07.694 --> 12:09.562
gonna be under arrest
as well, understood?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.031
- Yeah.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.800
- Let's go.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.235
- Benno.

12:19.840 --> 12:19.973
.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.374
- Alvin Gilbert
lawyered up en route.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.077
It's not his first time
at the rodeo.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.579
- Nope, there's stories
about him all over town.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.648
The guy preys on young models,
and his brother,

12:28.648 --> 12:29.817
Benno's the fixer.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.051
- His assistant Nora
facilitated.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.053
She took photos.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.455
TARU's going through
his camera and SD cards.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.925
- Uh-huh, I'm surprised
it's gotten this far.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.492
The House of Gilbert,

12:39.492 --> 12:40.928
they're masters
at image control.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.062
- [scoffs]

12:42.062 --> 12:43.997
- Sally, you know,
sweet kid,

12:43.997 --> 12:47.067
but her manager pimp,

12:47.067 --> 12:49.136
well, he controls her,
slaps her around.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.438
- Yeah, we've met him.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
- She's his meal ticket.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.707
He brings her to New York.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.176
He feels her slipping away.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.445
- You mean Alvin
had sex with her?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.216
- Photographers and girls,
you know,

13:03.216 --> 13:05.452
it happens.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.754
And if the mook boyfriend
finds out...

13:07.754 --> 13:10.057
- Girl cries rape?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.224
That's your take?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.160
- [chuckles]

13:13.160 --> 13:15.095
My brother dates
supermodels.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.964
He doesn't need
to rape a go-see.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.767
- Photography is seduction

13:20.767 --> 13:24.337
of the viewer's eye,
of the camera,

13:24.337 --> 13:25.705
and even of me.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.740
- She is legal.
We have her license on file.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.242
She signed a release.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.044
- My assistant was there
the whole time.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.446
You--you think I'd rape
someone in front of her?

13:33.446 --> 13:34.882
- I do.
- You know what, Sunil?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.583
I don't need this.
- No, you don't.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.018
Gentlemen--
- Sit down!

13:38.018 --> 13:39.386
You're in our custody.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.221
- For resisting arrest?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.623
Detective, that is
a lawsuit waiting to happen.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.192
- Carisi, hold on.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.327
Let the man tell
his side of the story.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.737
- Okay.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.739
Her manager

13:59.739 --> 14:04.677
accosted me at a bar,
showed me her photos,

14:04.677 --> 14:07.080
brought her over to me.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.918
She showed up at my studio
without him.

14:10.918 --> 14:15.655
She knew my work,
and she came ready to play.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.926
- "She showed up alone.
She came to play."

14:18.926 --> 14:19.993
They've got their defense.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.194
Where are those photos?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.663
- I will ask again.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.469
- Alvin and the girl
just clicked.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.372
- Okay, that's not how
Sally's describing it.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.175
- Now, because she wants
something from this family.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.980
Alvin was just responding
to what she was putting out,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.414
what she wanted from him.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.350
- Sally didn't want
what he did to her.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.085
- Not what I saw.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.087
I saw a girl who knew
what she was doing.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.122
- Well, I think you knew
what you were doing.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.061
Getting an underage girl drunk.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.029
- Really?

14:56.029 --> 14:58.966
Do you know what these girls
put in their systems?

14:58.966 --> 15:01.034
- This woman sets up models
to be raped.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.235
What, does she get off
on watching?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.504
- Pictures are in.
- Finally.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.507
[tense music]

15:07.507 --> 15:11.844
*

15:11.844 --> 15:14.281
- Ugh.
- She looks terrified.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.748
- Or they'll say
that's the campaign.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.617
"When fear becomes obsession."
- Seriously?

15:17.617 --> 15:19.219
- I have to tell you
about rape culture?

15:19.219 --> 15:21.654
- That's not an ad campaign;
that's a girl being assaulted.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.356
- Look, Barba's right.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.458
They're just gonna claim
that this was staged.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.493
- [sighing]

15:26.493 --> 15:28.996
- Is this enough
to arrest?

15:28.996 --> 15:31.064
- I'd like more,
but if we don't indict,

15:31.064 --> 15:32.765
he hops on a jet to France,
doesn't come back till

15:32.765 --> 15:34.601
Sally gets paid off.
- Right.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.405
*

15:38.405 --> 15:40.507
[tapping]

15:40.507 --> 15:43.910
*

15:43.910 --> 15:45.512
How about we book Nora too?

15:45.512 --> 15:50.350
*

15:50.350 --> 15:52.019
Nora Wattan, stand up.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.786
You're under arrest.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.023
*

15:56.023 --> 15:59.092
- Me?

15:59.092 --> 16:00.560
Because I gave a girl a drink?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.129
- For starters.
Turn around.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.697
And you facilitated
her assault.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.367
In New York, that's
rape in the first.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.469
- [gasps]

16:09.469 --> 16:13.406
*

16:15.942 --> 16:18.045
- Alvin Gilbert,
one count of first-degree--

16:18.045 --> 16:20.747
- That's "Jill-bare,"
Your Honor.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.182
- Either way.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.284
One count
of first-degree rape,

16:24.284 --> 16:25.318
how do you plead?

16:25.318 --> 16:26.419
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.454
- People on bail?

16:27.454 --> 16:30.057
- Remand.
Mr. Gilbert has a family jet

16:30.057 --> 16:32.459
and, uh, residences
in five countries.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.062
- My client has no record
and is the editorial director

16:35.062 --> 16:36.596
of a fashion empire.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.664
His family's business

16:37.664 --> 16:38.965
would be seriously
jeopardized

16:38.965 --> 16:40.800
if he had to cancel
any bookings, Your Honor.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.669
- I'm sure they have
the means to get by.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.071
- Given his resources,

16:44.071 --> 16:46.239
the defendant
will surrender his passport.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.076
Bail is set at $500,000.
[gavel bangs]

16:49.076 --> 16:50.743
- 500 grand.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.279
- That's good.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.313
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.314
- Next case,

16:54.314 --> 16:57.084
"People versus Nora Wattan."

16:57.084 --> 17:00.420
Are you representing her
as well, Mr. Varma?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.089
- For the moment,
Your Honor.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.890
We are arranging
for separate counsel

17:03.890 --> 17:05.492
for Miss Wattan.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.094
- A wise decision,

17:07.094 --> 17:08.861
and hopefully,
the appropriate person

17:08.861 --> 17:10.097
will be retained...

17:10.097 --> 17:11.498
[speaking indistinctly]

17:11.498 --> 17:12.699
I'd like to move along.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.501
- This is a complicated
case, Your Honor.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.735
[tense music]

17:15.735 --> 17:17.704
- They've got 120 hours
to indict.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.372
Get me more
for the grand jury.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.707
- Fin's trying to
track down the model

17:20.707 --> 17:21.908
that accused Alvin
12 years ago.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.210
- Tell Fin to hurry it up.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.744
- How about we go
back to Nora?

17:24.744 --> 17:26.946
I mean, the Gilberts
aren't even pretending

17:26.946 --> 17:28.281
to be worried about her.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.382
- Yeah.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.550
*

17:30.550 --> 17:32.219
Counselor,

17:32.219 --> 17:35.855
have you found separate counsel
yet for Miss Wattan?

17:35.855 --> 17:36.923
- I have my hands full.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.291
- Uh-huh, empty them.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.593
I need a word with her.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.129
*

17:42.129 --> 17:44.197
- Sorry we're late.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.398
- And you are?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.633
- Jason Gruber.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.135
- And you've passed
the bar exam?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.269
- Mr. Varma and I have

17:49.269 --> 17:51.538
worked closely on several cases,

17:51.538 --> 17:53.806
and he led me to believe
you wanted to discuss a deal?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.442
- We do.
- Good, because clearly,

17:55.442 --> 17:56.876
the charges against my client

17:56.876 --> 17:57.910
are an overreach.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.147
- Okay, if Miss Wattan

18:00.147 --> 18:02.515
will testify about
Alvin's assault,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.451
we can talk about withdrawing
her rape charge.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.519
- That was not an assault.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.821
That was a creative
collaboration--

18:08.821 --> 18:11.824
fear, lust, release,

18:11.824 --> 18:13.793
capturing primal emotions.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.162
- Okay, I get it.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.329
You've been Alvin's muse.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.497
- She's his associate.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.565
- But you're not seeing him

18:18.565 --> 18:21.168
for who he is.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.769
- Don't patronize me.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.374
Alvin is a genius.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.542
I would never betray him,

18:29.542 --> 18:32.212
and neither will any model
in this city.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.381
- Well, I hope you're right,

18:34.381 --> 18:38.050
'cause we're gonna be
talking to all of them.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.454
- The first time
with Alvin?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.556
Paris.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.425
- He propositioned you?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.026
- Alvin doesn't ask.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.028
He takes.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.231
- Did you want
to have sex with him?

18:51.231 --> 18:53.500
- No, but Alvin did.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.535
- Did you say no?
- [scoffs]

18:55.535 --> 18:57.904
Nobody says no
to Alvin Gilbert.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.740
- I mean, he didn't hold
a gun on me.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.410
Actually, he did.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.911
- He held a gun on you?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.946
- I don't think it was loaded.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.815
- Would you be willing
to testify?

19:08.815 --> 19:10.483
- Against Alvin?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.852
No.
I would never work again.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.321
- Wait, he told you that?

19:14.321 --> 19:17.524
- [scoffs]
He doesn't have to.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.626
I'm sorry.

19:19.626 --> 19:25.898
*

19:25.898 --> 19:27.099
- That was fast.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.302
- At least she came in.
These others--

19:29.302 --> 19:30.837
- Munch came through.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.606
He found Alvin's vic
from 12 years ago.

19:33.606 --> 19:37.244
She changed her name
and owns a modeling agency.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.446
She sends girls to Alvin.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.114
*

19:44.784 --> 19:46.919
- You two, huh?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.521
Why bring up something
that happened 12 years ago?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.690
- Because it happened again,
three days ago.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.459
- [sighs]

19:52.459 --> 19:54.661
And you're the ones
going after Alvin?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.062
[upbeat music]

19:56.062 --> 19:59.732
That girl,
she's not so innocent,

19:59.732 --> 20:01.534
and she was not
one of mine.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.370
- But you've sent him
other girls.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.171
- This is a business.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.474
Alvin's the best.
He's a career maker.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.842
A girl becomes Alvin's muse,
every door is open.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.678
- Muse?

20:11.678 --> 20:13.079
You tried to kill yourself.

20:13.079 --> 20:16.048
- Oh, yeah, poor me.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.151
I was a gamine,
so young, so naive,

20:19.151 --> 20:23.723
18, posing half naked
for a man twice my age.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.526
I knew I was
turning him on.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.860
When he started to touch me

20:27.860 --> 20:30.763
I could've walked away,
but I didn't.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.198
*

20:32.198 --> 20:35.435
What did I think
was gonna happen?

20:35.435 --> 20:37.437
- Three days,
two dozen interviews.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.406
At least half of these
models admit

20:39.406 --> 20:41.207
to being pressured into sex.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.575
- None of them will testify.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.511
- But what about the vic
from 12 years ago?

20:44.511 --> 20:46.078
- That story
has a happy ending.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.814
She's pimping for him now.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.749
- No one wants to bite
the hand that made them.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.983
- The clock is running out.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.485
Grand jury's tomorrow,
9:00 a.m.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.587
- Take another run at Nora?
- Not a chance.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.788
She thinks she's
part of the family.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.790
- Okay, so all we have
is Sally.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.826
- Prep her.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.060
Make sure she's good to go.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.601
- So you just tell
the grand jurors

21:08.601 --> 21:11.438
the details of what
Alvin did to you.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.806
- There's no cross-examination.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.575
- Is Mr. Barba
gonna show everyone

21:15.575 --> 21:17.009
the photos that Nora took?

21:17.009 --> 21:18.811
- I'm sorry--
[door rattles open]

21:22.482 --> 21:23.816
- What the hell
are you doing here?

21:23.816 --> 21:25.017
- Take it easy, man.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.453
We're here on police business.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.388
- We're prepping Sally
for her testimony.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.589
- Oh, okay.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.124
I didn't see you.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.427
Sally, you didn't tell me.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.262
- Well, you were gone
for three hours.

21:36.262 --> 21:37.364
- I was at the gym.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.865
I told you that.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.234
[sighs]

21:44.537 --> 21:46.238
Well...
[grunts]

21:46.238 --> 21:48.508
I'm here now.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.577
Tell me what she's
gonna have to do.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.280
- She's late.
Was she okay when you left her?

21:54.280 --> 21:55.682
- Uh, yeah, I mean,
Matt the manager

21:55.682 --> 21:58.385
was draped all over her,
but she was steady on her story.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.554
- There she is.
Sally.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.055
Hey.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.624
- Grand jury's waiting.
Shall we?

22:04.624 --> 22:06.459
- Great, Matt, you can
wait here; let's go.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.395
- Actually, I'm not
going to testify.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.629
- I'm sorry?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.230
- After you left,
I-I kept thinking

22:11.230 --> 22:12.732
about those photos,

22:12.732 --> 22:14.166
total strangers seeing them

22:14.166 --> 22:16.202
and people back home too.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.804
Alvin is famous.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.205
You don't understand.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.272
Once it's all over
the Internet--

22:20.272 --> 22:21.741
- No one will see them.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.009
These proceedings are secret,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.243
and you're a minor.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.212
- Yeah, right, those
photos will get out.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.680
It's like what happened
with Erin Andrews.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.516
- Matt, wouldn't you
be pissed

22:29.516 --> 22:31.117
if Alvin got away with this?

22:31.117 --> 22:33.753
- If it was up to me,
I'd put a slug in the guy.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.488
Be that as it may,

22:35.488 --> 22:37.590
this is what Sally wants.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.791
Right, babe?

22:38.791 --> 22:40.259
[tense music]

22:40.259 --> 22:41.628
- Sally,

22:41.628 --> 22:43.430
please don't do this.

22:52.439 --> 22:52.539
.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.073
- We're screwed.
No continuance.

22:55.341 --> 22:56.509
If the grand jury
doesn't indict

22:56.509 --> 22:57.677
by 5:00 tomorrow,
Alvin's bail

22:57.677 --> 22:59.211
automatically
reduces to $1.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.312
- He won't stick around.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.681
Passport or not,
he'll find a way out.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.782
- Does anyone
actually believe

23:02.782 --> 23:04.717
Sally is the one
making this decision?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.653
Matt's obviously
pulling her strings.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.154
- Sally is his meal ticket.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.122
The Gilberts
must've made Sally

23:10.122 --> 23:12.124
an offer that Matt
couldn't refuse.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.093
- Witness tampering?
That's tough to prove.

23:14.093 --> 23:18.631
- Well, unless you have
a better idea, that's all I got.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.132
- Sorry, detectives.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.868
Witness tampering?

23:21.868 --> 23:24.771
I've had zero contact
with Sally Landry.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.873
Sonya!

23:26.873 --> 23:28.340
That hem is pulling out.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.142
- What about
her manager, Matt?

23:30.142 --> 23:32.812
- Uh, he did come to see me
yesterday.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.747
He didn't tell you?

23:34.747 --> 23:37.884
Maybe that's because he pulled
a gun on me and Alvin.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.586
- What'd he want?

23:39.586 --> 23:40.920
- $50,000.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.055
- In exchange for Sally
not testifying?

23:43.055 --> 23:44.290
- Benno!

23:44.290 --> 23:47.960
The beer is warm
out here--

23:47.960 --> 23:49.929
Go start without me.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.363
[electronic music]

23:51.363 --> 23:53.165
You guys come here
to apologize?

23:53.165 --> 23:55.735
- Why, because Benno
paid off Sally's manager?

23:55.735 --> 23:57.770
- There was no quid pro quo.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.507
All right, he pitched
a couple of lame-ass

24:00.507 --> 24:02.174
editorial ideas.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.409
I pretended to like them,

24:03.409 --> 24:04.811
and I gave him some seed money.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.045
- He pulls a gun.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.781
You write a check,
and you didn't call the police?

24:08.781 --> 24:11.050
- Look, I'm a businessman,
all right?

24:11.050 --> 24:12.885
We're about to go public.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.654
My brother is 100% innocent.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.523
- How about 1,000%?

24:16.523 --> 24:19.125
- So if I can make this
go away--

24:19.125 --> 24:21.360
- All right, I'm not lawyer, but
it sounds like you're admitting

24:21.360 --> 24:22.529
to paying off a witness.

24:22.529 --> 24:25.532
- I did this to help Sally.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.099
I thought that if this

24:27.099 --> 24:29.268
cheap suit Svengali
got a taste,

24:29.268 --> 24:31.337
maybe he'd leave
the poor girl alone.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.339
- You saw her bruises.

24:33.339 --> 24:37.009
This boyfriend,
he's the one who rapes her.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.410
When I simulated violence,

24:38.410 --> 24:39.411
she got off on it.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.412
- Oh, Alvin.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.413
- Benno--
- Please.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.249
- Benno, stop worrying.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.317
Lighten up, okay?

24:45.317 --> 24:47.854
*

24:47.854 --> 24:49.121
- Did I come with a gun?

24:49.121 --> 24:51.558
Did I come with a gun?
Did I come with a gun?

24:51.558 --> 24:52.559
Is that what they told you?

24:52.559 --> 24:54.093
- Matt, they have witnesses.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.795
- The gun was part
of my pitch.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.163
- Okay, so just calm down.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.998
What--what pitch?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.032
Okay?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.568
- Alvin likes guns.

25:01.568 --> 25:02.902
You seen the series
with the girls

25:02.902 --> 25:04.370
sucking on gun barrels?

25:04.370 --> 25:06.372
They hired me
to consult editorially.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.974
- For 50 grand?

25:07.974 --> 25:09.742
And you're telling me
that had nothing to do

25:09.742 --> 25:11.077
with Sally
dropping the charges?

25:11.077 --> 25:13.580
Nothing?
- Tell them. Tell them.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.281
Tell them how I'm protecting
your career.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.482
- He is.

25:16.482 --> 25:17.884
I testify, and I'm back

25:17.884 --> 25:20.319
at the creamery
making Fudge-Anas.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.122
- And that's not gonna
happen to my baby.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.358
[phone ringing]

25:26.358 --> 25:28.460
Yeah?

25:28.460 --> 25:29.596
She'll be there.

25:29.596 --> 25:32.198
And you put me
on the list, right?

25:32.198 --> 25:35.001
[tense music]

25:35.001 --> 25:37.804
Guess who's closing the
Gilbert runway show tomorrow.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.806
- Oh, my gosh!

25:39.806 --> 25:41.140
- Aw.
- Really?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.809
*

25:42.809 --> 25:44.110
Wait, will Alvin be there?

25:44.110 --> 25:45.244
- Don't worry, baby.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.946
I won't let you
out of my sight.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.881
- Can I ask who just called
to make that booking?

25:48.881 --> 25:49.982
Was it Nora?

25:49.982 --> 25:53.352
- Nora?
No, Nora's gone.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.321
Claire, Benno's wife,

25:55.321 --> 25:58.224
she's running the show now.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.628
If you'll excuse us, my baby
needs her beauty rest.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.864
*

26:04.864 --> 26:06.633
Mm?

26:08.935 --> 26:10.770
- Yes, Claire is taking over

26:10.770 --> 26:12.104
booking Alvin's models.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.640
It's just temporary.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.842
- So you're not involved
in tomorrow's fashion show?

26:15.842 --> 26:17.944
- All on the advice
of counsel.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.278
- Alvin's or yours,
Nora?

26:19.278 --> 26:21.313
Oh, right, yours is paid for
by his family.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.115
- When there's no case,
there's no case.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.251
- Well, actually...

26:25.251 --> 26:28.688
Nora has admitted to serving
Sally, a minor, drinks.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.322
- Oh, please.
- And what should be more

26:30.322 --> 26:32.191
troubling to her legal team,
Nora has admitted

26:32.191 --> 26:34.193
to taking photos of Sally
having sex with Alvin.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.527
- Consensual sex.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.463
- She's 17,
and while New York

26:37.463 --> 26:39.766
may not be able
to press charges,

26:39.766 --> 26:42.401
according to the Feds, that
constitutes child pornography.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.106
- Is that true?
- He knows it is.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.108
Punishable by five years
for each image.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.677
- It's just a tactic, Nora.

26:50.677 --> 26:53.680
- A tactic?

26:53.680 --> 26:56.716
Nora, the Gilberts gave Matt

26:56.716 --> 26:59.986
$50,000 to "consult."

26:59.986 --> 27:01.688
Sally is in the runway show.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.290
What have they done for you?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.525
Nora, when is the last time
you spoke with Alvin?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.197
He is taking your calls,
isn't he?

27:11.197 --> 27:13.032
- There's been no contact
on advice of counsel.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.400
- Oh, come on.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.435
Since when does Alvin
listen to anybody?

27:16.435 --> 27:18.470
- You think he'll visit you
in prison?

27:18.470 --> 27:20.439
Or maybe do a spread,
Models Behind Bars?

27:20.439 --> 27:23.142
- That's it. We're done.
Nora, let's go.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.312
- You know Alvin better
than anybody, right?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.814
He's always on to the next,

27:27.814 --> 27:30.082
on to the next look,
on to the next model.

27:30.082 --> 27:33.485
You may feel different,

27:33.485 --> 27:36.055
but you know he'll
find a new muse.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.623
- You don't understand
what we have.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.792
- I think that I do.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.895
He's gonna tell you that
he's sorry and that he feels

27:42.895 --> 27:44.596
bad and that he loves you

27:44.596 --> 27:48.234
but he had no choice.

27:48.234 --> 27:52.004
You've heard that
before, right?

27:52.004 --> 27:56.075
Alvin, this is the first time
he's been arrested.

27:56.075 --> 27:59.278
The Gilberts
protect their own.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.380
You're not his wife.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.816
You're not his family.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.351
You're the hired help.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.354
[tense music]

28:08.354 --> 28:10.857
*

28:10.857 --> 28:12.324
- Copy that,
lieutenant.

28:12.324 --> 28:13.926
Nice job.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.028
Liv says Barba amended
the arrest warrant,

28:16.028 --> 28:17.629
added ten charges of rape.

28:17.629 --> 28:18.931
Turns out Nora kept videos.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.400
- So we pick up
Alvin ASAP.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.601
You know, if Nora turned

28:22.601 --> 28:24.003
in front of the lawyer
they supplied her,

28:24.003 --> 28:25.905
the Gilberts have
to know about it.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.306
- You think Alvin's
even here?

28:27.306 --> 28:29.175
- Yeah, big show,
corporate IPO,

28:29.175 --> 28:30.542
models--he's here.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.511
- They probably have the jet
warming up on the tarmac.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.780
Let's move.

28:33.780 --> 28:36.916
- She is their top model,
and I am her manager.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.384
- I don't care who you are.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.386
- Yo, how many times I got
to tell you I'm on the list?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.021
- No, you're not.
- Hey, Matt.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.155
What's going on?

28:43.155 --> 28:45.024
- This moron won't let me in.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.793
You're gonna lose your job
over this.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.427
- NYPD.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.561
- Is there a problem,
officer?

28:49.561 --> 28:50.797
- Yeah,
is Alvin Gilbert here?

28:50.797 --> 28:52.464
- Yeah, he's inside.
- Thank you.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.834
- You tell Benno Gilbert
to come here now!

28:54.834 --> 28:56.102
Get him here!

28:56.102 --> 28:57.369
- Hey, Matt, take it easy,
all right?

28:57.369 --> 28:59.471
- Screw you!
Screw all you!

28:59.471 --> 29:03.342
You tell Benno and Alvin
I am coming back for them!

29:03.342 --> 29:06.178

29:09.181 --> 29:11.884
*

29:11.884 --> 29:13.585
- Hey, any luck with Alvin?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.822
- I haven't seen him,
Benno, or Claire.

29:15.822 --> 29:18.290
- Okay, Fin, go out front.
- Copy.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.992
- Rollins, Carisi, take
the dressing room areas.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.094
I'll hang backstage.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.330
*

29:24.330 --> 29:27.299
Anyone seen Alvin Gilbert?

29:27.299 --> 29:29.168
- Gorgeous.

29:29.168 --> 29:32.238
- Hey, excuse me,
ladies.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.272
Eva.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.473
- Detectives.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.075
- Yeah,
have you seen Alvin?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.844
- Not since he stuck
his hand up my dress.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.912
- Eva, got to go.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.313
*

29:41.313 --> 29:43.082
- I'll check upstairs.
- All right.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.551
*

29:45.551 --> 29:47.019
No eyes on Alvin yet.

29:47.019 --> 29:54.426
*

29:54.426 --> 29:56.595
- Not out here either.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.931
- I got his brother.
Hey, Benno.

29:58.931 --> 29:59.932
- Why are you here?

29:59.932 --> 30:01.400
Sally, go.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.501
- Security didn't tell you?

30:02.501 --> 30:03.502
Your lawyer didn't call?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.004
- And go, go, go.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.305
- Where is he?
- Alvin?

30:06.305 --> 30:07.573
You tell me.

30:07.573 --> 30:08.674
I'm not my brother's keeper.

in 20 seconds.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.819
- Where's Alvin?
- I don't know.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.988
He's not out there?

30:21.988 --> 30:23.789
- When's the last time
you saw him?

30:23.789 --> 30:25.791
- I-I don't know.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.960
- Benno, focus.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.663
no Alvin.

- No one's seen him.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.100
- He's not here.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.036
The guy disappeared.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.004
- Alvin!
Oh, my God!

- It came from out back.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.145
Hey, what happened?
- Oh, my God.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.347
I came out for a smoke.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.249
I saw Alvin lying there.

31:23.249 --> 31:27.719

31:27.719 --> 31:29.055

[siren wailing]

31:40.799 --> 31:41.968
- What the hell happened?

31:41.968 --> 31:43.569
- Maria Carla,
the booker, found him.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.338
One shot to the groin.
One shot to the chest.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.706
- Any chance she did it?

31:47.706 --> 31:49.375
- No, her screams
were real.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.542
The body was still warm.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.843
The blood hadn't
congealed yet.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.479
This must've happened
in the last half hour.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.081
- No phone or wallet
or gun recovered yet,

31:55.081 --> 31:56.282
but we're searching
the area.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.085
- Okay, get TARU
tracking the phone...

31:59.085 --> 32:02.588
and that camera above the door.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.990
Everybody still inside?

32:03.990 --> 32:06.692
- Yeah, Fin and Rollins are
keeping the place locked down.

[tense music]

32:10.229 --> 32:12.131
[indistinct radio chatter]

32:12.131 --> 32:13.565
- Who would do something
like this?

32:13.565 --> 32:16.002
- You tell me.
- I know exactly who.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.903
- You do? Who?

32:17.903 --> 32:20.439
- That boyfriend of Sally's,
Matt.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.374
He made threats.

32:22.374 --> 32:25.011
- He was at the door
when we first came in.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.013
He was pissed that
he wasn't on the list.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.915
- Was his name supposed
to be on the list?

32:29.915 --> 32:31.283
- He was.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.120
He must've called me
nine times,

32:34.120 --> 32:35.654
but I didn't want to risk it

32:35.654 --> 32:37.289
because Sally was
closing the show.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.091
I--

32:39.091 --> 32:42.261
I should've just let him in.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.862
- Is it true
what everyone is saying?

32:43.862 --> 32:45.097
Alvin was shot?

32:45.097 --> 32:46.698
- Yeah, he was,

32:46.698 --> 32:50.669
and your boyfriend
was making threats,

32:50.669 --> 32:52.038
and he owns a gun.

32:52.038 --> 32:54.106
- Oh, my God.
- You need to call him.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.575
Make an excuse,
but find out where he is.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.444
*

32:58.444 --> 33:00.279
Listen, if he didn't do this,

33:00.279 --> 33:02.281
this all goes away.

33:02.281 --> 33:09.955
*

33:09.955 --> 33:13.059
- So I lost my temper
at the runway show.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.760
Those bastards kept me
off the list.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.428
- We could see
you were pissed.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.197
- Hells yeah, I was.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.199
Sally needed me.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.633
What are they
accusing me of now?

33:21.633 --> 33:23.635
Yelling at that jamoke
security guard?

33:23.635 --> 33:25.837
- It's a little bit more
serious than that, Matt.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.073
Alvin's dead.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.740
- Somebody gunned him down.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.077
*

33:31.077 --> 33:32.711
- Wait, you--

33:32.711 --> 33:34.346
you guys don't think
that I did it?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.715
- "I'm gonna put a slug
in that guy."

33:36.715 --> 33:38.984
That sound familiar?

33:38.984 --> 33:41.753
- I didn't even bring my gun
to the show.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.456
I left it back home.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.525
That's where I was heading
when you guys picked me up,

33:46.525 --> 33:49.661
to get my gun
to go back to the show

33:49.661 --> 33:52.831
so that I could scare the crap
out of those SOBs.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.101
- That's his alibi?
[phone ringing]

33:55.101 --> 33:57.269
- Rollins and Carisi
are searching his apartment.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.105
Benson.

34:00.572 --> 34:03.409
Yeah.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.144
Okay, thanks.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.979
Well, it turns out
that Alvin's phone

34:07.979 --> 34:11.717
and wallet were in a drawer
in his office.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.519
- So not a robbery.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.354
He was shot once in the chest,
once in the groin?

34:15.354 --> 34:16.422
- Well, the M.E.
thought that

34:16.422 --> 34:17.923
the shot in the groin
was first.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.458
- Of course it was.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.360
Somebody wanted Alvin
to have a couple seconds

34:21.360 --> 34:23.162
to think about who shot him
and what his life

34:23.162 --> 34:24.796
would be like
without his pecker.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.698
[phone ringing]

34:26.698 --> 34:28.134
Vonnegut?

34:28.134 --> 34:29.335
"Slaughterhouse-Five."

34:29.335 --> 34:30.969
- Benson.
- We found Matt's gun.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.304
9-millimeter Beretta.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.140
- Yeah, I don't even think
this has been fired, no.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.007
This isn't even operable.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.509
Have you ever seen him
with a different gun?

34:37.509 --> 34:39.145
- No, just that one.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.913
He sleeps with it
under his pillow.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.582
Does that mean
he didn't do it?

34:45.684 --> 34:50.189
Look, please, please do not
let him know I led you to him.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.191
[tense music]

34:52.191 --> 34:53.825
- No GSR on Matt's hand.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.927
Wrong gun.
So we just let him go?

34:55.927 --> 34:57.563
- No, not until
I talk to Sally.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.265
Maybe get an OOP for her.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.932
- You're worried about
what he might do?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.301
- Oh, I know what he'll do.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.535
- Then I'll hold him
on the gun charge,

35:03.535 --> 35:04.636
make sure he
does time on that.

35:04.636 --> 35:05.704
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:05.704 --> 35:06.738
- I got security footage

35:06.738 --> 35:08.240
from the courtyard.

35:08.240 --> 35:13.579
*

35:13.579 --> 35:15.080
Shooter knew
where the camera was,

35:15.080 --> 35:16.815
so he stays out of view.

35:16.815 --> 35:26.258
*

35:26.258 --> 35:27.493
- Back up.

35:27.493 --> 35:31.630
*

35:31.630 --> 35:33.665
Pause it.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.201
Right there when Alvin
turns around,

35:35.201 --> 35:37.269
the look on his face
when he sees the shooter.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.804
- He knows him.
[cell phone chimes]

35:38.804 --> 35:40.539
He's not afraid of him.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.441
- Uni found a gun
on the roof,

35:42.441 --> 35:43.909
a .357 Magnum.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.577
- .357?
That's old-school.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.845
- Yeah, it is,

35:46.845 --> 35:48.347
just like Alvin's.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.582
- Wha--Alvin was shot
with his own gun?

35:50.582 --> 35:51.950
- Maybe.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.652
By someone he knew.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.454
*

35:55.454 --> 35:57.956
By someone
he was happy to see.

35:57.956 --> 36:00.992
- We got this all wrong.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.462
It's not the guy who was
shaking Alvin down.

36:03.462 --> 36:06.232
- It's the guy who's been
cleaning up his messes.

36:13.339 --> 36:13.472
.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.242
- Thank you so much
for coming in.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.277
Right this way.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.845
- Yeah, let's hope, uh--

36:19.845 --> 36:20.979
we heard you arrested Matt.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.414
- We did, and, um,

36:22.414 --> 36:24.250
we just wanted to go over
the timeline with you.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.951
- Anything we can do.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.052
- So we got this

36:27.052 --> 36:29.255
from a model backstage.

36:29.255 --> 36:32.023
This is Alvin halfway
through the show.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.592
- Yeah, I saw him there.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.761
- Yeah, uh, same spot

36:35.761 --> 36:38.264
five minutes later,
Claire is there.

36:38.264 --> 36:40.031
Alvin's gone.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.435
- Alvin always went out
for a smoke halfway through.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.903
- And where were you

36:44.903 --> 36:47.038
at this point, Benno?

36:47.038 --> 36:48.974
- I am everywhere,

36:48.974 --> 36:52.411
um, checking on the hair
and the clothes and the makeup.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.880
I mean, I'm just making sure
everything's going right.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.715
- Sounds like a lot of pressure.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.284
- He's the best
in the world at it.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.818
- And on top of that,
you have to worry

36:59.818 --> 37:01.620
about your little brother
getting arrested

37:01.620 --> 37:03.121
for multiple counts of rape.

37:03.121 --> 37:04.823
- Alvin was not a rapist.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.292
- You mean he was
never convicted

37:06.292 --> 37:07.559
because every time

37:07.559 --> 37:09.194
he was accused, you just

37:09.194 --> 37:12.398
made it go away.

37:12.398 --> 37:15.301
- Alvin's dead.
Matt killed him.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.135
Why are we talking
about any of this?

37:17.135 --> 37:19.004
- Because Matt
wasn't the shooter.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.407
It wasn't his gun.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.375
Alvin was shot
with his own gun.

37:23.375 --> 37:27.045
- So Matt stole it
from the studio.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.380
- No.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.816
He would've had gunshot
residue on his hands.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.184
We picked him up
right afterwards,

37:33.184 --> 37:36.054
and there's--
there was no residue, no GSR.

37:36.054 --> 37:39.725
I mean, you fire a gun
like that, and it gets

37:39.725 --> 37:41.560
all over everything,
you know,

37:41.560 --> 37:42.928
everything you touch.

37:42.928 --> 37:46.197
- So, if, say,
you shot your brother

37:46.197 --> 37:48.834
and then five minutes later
you hugged Sally,

37:48.834 --> 37:53.472
we would find gunshot residue
on that dress.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.874
- So CSU's going
to pick up that dress

37:55.874 --> 37:57.676
right now from your atelier.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.612
- You can't think
my husband did this.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.348
- Yeah, I can.

38:02.348 --> 38:05.351
[tense music]

38:05.351 --> 38:08.354
You see,
I have a younger brother.

38:08.354 --> 38:11.457
He's been in and out of rehab
so many times,

38:11.457 --> 38:14.125
I've lost count.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.927
And every time that
he gets in trouble,

38:15.927 --> 38:18.364
he tells the cops,
"Call my brother.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.367
He's on the job.
He'll take care of it."

38:21.367 --> 38:23.835
And then when I go
pick him up,

38:23.835 --> 38:26.004
he says, "Promise me
you won't tell Dad."

38:26.004 --> 38:27.806
[chuckles]

38:27.806 --> 38:30.476
*

38:30.476 --> 38:32.378
He's my brother,

38:32.378 --> 38:34.079
and I love him.

38:34.079 --> 38:37.383
*

38:37.383 --> 38:39.150
But I can't tell you
how much easier

38:39.150 --> 38:40.952
my life would be
without him.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.289
*

38:44.289 --> 38:46.925
- Alvin getting arrested,

38:46.925 --> 38:48.527
Alvin going to trial

38:48.527 --> 38:49.828
right when your company

38:49.828 --> 38:51.863
was about to go public...

38:51.863 --> 38:57.403
*

38:57.403 --> 39:00.105
- We would've lost everything.
- Stop, Benno.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.073
You are going to find
gunshot residue

39:02.073 --> 39:03.809
on the dress from my hands.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.811
- No, Claire, no!
- I shot him, Benno.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.613
I couldn't let him
take you--us down.

39:07.613 --> 39:08.747
- You--no, stop it.
Shut up.

39:08.747 --> 39:09.881
Stop it right now.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.049
Shut up.
She's lying.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.152
I shot him.
- No, you didn't. I did.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.921
And we're not gonna say
another word about it

39:15.921 --> 39:18.223
until our lawyer comes.

39:18.223 --> 39:26.965
*

39:26.965 --> 39:28.534
- Their lawyers say they
were never Mirandized.

39:28.534 --> 39:29.635
Were they in custody?

39:29.635 --> 39:31.169
- Nope, they came in
voluntarily.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.337
- Okay, that goes away.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.572
Bigger problem:
they both confessed.

39:33.572 --> 39:34.673
- Which means each one
has created

39:34.673 --> 39:36.007
reasonable doubt for the other.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.843
- Onion Field meets
Fashion Avenue.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.945
- The question is,
who's lying?

39:39.945 --> 39:41.847
- She is.
He did it.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.152
That look on Alvin's face
right before

39:47.152 --> 39:49.988
he got shot...

39:49.988 --> 39:53.759
I know that look.

39:53.759 --> 39:57.062
- So that story you told Benno
about your brother...

39:58.597 --> 40:01.633
- It wasn't a story.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.041
[door clicks and rattles]

40:10.041 --> 40:12.444
- Hey, Noah.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.980
Hey, sweet boy,
Mommy's home.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.114
Thanks, John.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.450
- You finally got Benno
to take a plea.

40:18.450 --> 40:20.185
Worth the wait.
Brother killing brother,

40:20.185 --> 40:21.787
I didn't see that coming.

40:21.787 --> 40:22.888
- Well, Dodds did.

40:22.888 --> 40:25.557
- Dodds, the new, new guy?

40:25.557 --> 40:26.925
- Yeah.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.960
- Fin told me you got
a good squad working for you.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.729
- [sighs]
Fin said what?

40:30.729 --> 40:33.098
- I was worried when I left

40:33.098 --> 40:34.933
that I'd fall apart
without the job

40:34.933 --> 40:37.636
or the place would
fall apart without me.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.004
- Well, I was too.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.106
- Oh, yeah,
but it's been good.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.408
Turns out there's more
to life than SVU.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.410
- Hmm, ain't that the truth?

40:45.410 --> 40:48.079
- Well, I'm glad
we both found that out.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.081
[gentle piano music]

40:50.081 --> 40:51.382
Had a great time
with him today.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.451
Taught him
a major life lesson.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.986
Always question authority.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.722
- Ah, what a surprise.

40:56.722 --> 40:57.789
How was that?

40:57.789 --> 40:59.558
- Noah, show Mommy.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.726
Say, "Why?"

41:00.726 --> 41:01.893
- Why?
- Ah!

41:01.893 --> 41:03.595
[both laughing]

41:03.595 --> 41:05.731
- You can thank me when
he's a fully functioning,

41:05.731 --> 41:07.298
anti-dogmatic atheist.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.967
- [laughing]
I'll do that.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.770
- I should get going.
- Okay.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.639
- Bye, little man.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.574
*

41:15.574 --> 41:16.642
[exhales]

41:16.642 --> 41:20.345
*

41:20.345 --> 41:21.647
Take care of each other.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.549
- [whispering] We will.
You too.

41:23.549 --> 41:28.119
*

41:28.119 --> 41:29.254
Say, "Bye, Munch."

41:29.254 --> 41:30.355
- [whispers]
Bye, Munch.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.958
- Hmm. Yeah.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.025
Bye.

41:34.025 --> 41:42.300
*

42:19.070 --> 42:22.040
[wolf howling]
