No. Yeah.

00:07.130 --> 00:07.966
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08.132 --> 00:09.775
I mean, sure.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.977
[Screams]

[Bike whirring]

00:15.306 --> 00:17.434
[All screaming]

00:17.600 --> 00:19.353
- What are you doing?
- Aah!

00:19.943 --> 00:21.687
- Whoa!
- Ooh.

00:21.812 --> 00:23.607
You know what?
I'm outta here.

00:23.773 --> 00:24.956
No, no, no, wait, no, no, no.
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

00:25.081 --> 00:25.943
Don't leave!
They'll leave!

00:26.109 --> 00:27.527
- I'll make them leave!
- Sorry.

00:27.784 --> 00:29.446
You're not gonna
survive the apocalypse

00:29.612 --> 00:31.657
- with that attitude.
- What the hell are you doing?

00:31.823 --> 00:33.408
- We're larping.
- We're larping.

00:33.574 --> 00:35.300
Get psyched up for
<i>Code of Ronin: Undead Apocalypse.</i>

00:35.425 --> 00:36.453
The game comes out tomorrow, man!

00:36.619 --> 00:38.121
Yeah, I'm a zombie.

00:38.287 --> 00:39.594
I'm not like a dumb zombie
who eats brains.

00:39.719 --> 00:41.173
I'm like a smart one
who eats, like...

00:41.298 --> 00:43.085
- like, Boston market and stuff.
- Yeah.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.773
Okay, good to know.
I was about to do

00:44.898 --> 00:46.713
some eatin' of my own
until you guys came in.

00:46.879 --> 00:47.923
- Really?
- That's awesome.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.480
You know what?
That was the girl from the bank.

00:49.605 --> 00:50.849
- Wasn't it?
- That was the darkness?

00:50.974 --> 00:52.344
Both:
That was the darkness!

00:52.510 --> 00:53.919
Her name is Jenny from the bank.

00:54.044 --> 00:56.088
So Jenny was the girl
that was definitely not

00:56.213 --> 00:57.891
- gonna bless you with her sex.
- Oh.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.224
Does this look like she was never

00:59.349 --> 01:02.360
gonna bless me with her sex?

01:02.485 --> 01:03.814
Dang.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.232
Ders got some butt.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.778
And I actually need weed for, like,

01:19.903 --> 01:21.456
everything in my life.

01:21.622 --> 01:23.417
- It's a crutch.
- It's pretty bad, yeah.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.419
Hey, Blake, I'm feeling sick,

01:25.585 --> 01:27.629
so I need you to work my desk
for the rest of the day.

01:27.795 --> 01:29.506
Ugh.
You look horrible.

01:29.672 --> 01:30.789
- Well...
- Yeah.

01:30.914 --> 01:32.690
About that, I can't, not today.

01:32.815 --> 01:34.359
<i>Code Of Ronin</i> comes out tonight,

01:34.484 --> 01:36.763
and I gotta save a spot in line
at the video game store.

01:36.929 --> 01:38.396
Actually, I was just about to leave.

01:38.521 --> 01:40.331
Check it out.

01:40.456 --> 01:42.269
- That's good form.
- Nice.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.302
Huh? I'm gonna
put 'em in the bathroom stall,

01:44.427 --> 01:46.523
tell everybody I'm crapping
the rest of the day.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.806
Okay, well, I can't lie to you guys.

01:47.931 --> 01:49.552
I'm not really sick.
I just...

01:49.677 --> 01:51.943
I told Alice that,
so I could leave early

01:52.068 --> 01:55.991
to go see <i>Walking With
Dinosaurs: Arena Spectacular.</i>

01:56.157 --> 01:58.368
Uh, maybe one of these guys
could cover for you.

01:58.534 --> 01:59.785
I really shouldn't.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.086
It would set a precedence
in this office

02:01.211 --> 02:03.415
- that we don't need.
- No, for Alice?

02:03.581 --> 02:05.490
We'd probably end up fuggin' all day,

02:05.615 --> 02:07.335
get no work done.

02:07.501 --> 02:09.670
Please, Blake.
I mean, my lifelong dream

02:09.836 --> 02:12.132
is to live in <i>Jurassic Park</i> times.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.133
1993?

02:13.356 --> 02:15.600
Please, I really need this!

02:15.725 --> 02:16.768
I need it!

02:16.893 --> 02:19.765
Okay?
[Quivering]

02:20.932 --> 02:21.892
Please, Blake!

02:22.058 --> 02:22.908
All right, all right,
all right, yeah.

02:23.033 --> 02:24.342
- Oh, okay, great.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:24.467 --> 02:25.576
That's Alice's appointment book.

02:25.701 --> 02:26.678
Okay, sure, appointment book.

02:26.803 --> 02:28.046
- [Screeches]
- [Growls]

02:28.171 --> 02:28.857
- Have a lot of fun.
- Get out of here.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.150
Jillian, feel better.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.883
Oh, no. I'm not actually sick.

02:32.008 --> 02:34.119
So what you said
about my face earlier was...

02:34.244 --> 02:36.154
- it was rude.
- No game.

02:36.279 --> 02:38.241
Great, now I'm gonna be
24 hours behind

02:38.407 --> 02:39.891
everybody's skill level.

02:40.016 --> 02:42.454
Those racist teenagers online
are gonna butt ram me.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.081
- Ders.
- Sorry.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.463
Buddy, come on, dude.

02:45.588 --> 02:46.898
Please just stand in line for me.

02:47.023 --> 02:48.133
And then once I get off work,

02:48.258 --> 02:49.002
I'll come bail you out, please.

02:49.292 --> 02:50.468
- [Laughs] No.
- Come on.

02:50.593 --> 02:52.237
Are you kidding, after last night?

02:52.362 --> 02:53.638
Dude, I gotta get the darkness
back to our house.

02:53.763 --> 02:55.173
I'm thinking about stepping it up,

02:55.298 --> 02:57.135
getting out the guy-liner,
crossing over.

02:57.301 --> 02:59.262
Yeah, you do kinda look like
Jared Leto a little bit.

02:59.428 --> 03:01.723
- Seriously, thank you.
- Yeah, but, like, an uglier version of him.

03:01.889 --> 03:03.225
Sure, that works for me.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.782
I guess,
probably not even Jared Leto,

03:04.907 --> 03:06.617
like a relative of his
who's fat and ugly

03:06.742 --> 03:08.230
but still sees Jared on Christmas.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.357
Can't slam me,
not with Jared Leto in there.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.622
- Adam?
- Hmm?

03:11.747 --> 03:13.325
- Help me out, dude.
- Mm-mm.

03:13.450 --> 03:14.492
Come on, you're my brother.
You're my bro!

03:14.617 --> 03:16.127
- Come on.
- No. No, no, no, no.

03:16.252 --> 03:17.489
I hate lines, dude.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.297
Look, you could buy a bunch of games.

03:19.422 --> 03:20.798
And then when they sell out,
you could sell 'em on eBay.

03:20.923 --> 03:23.495
You'll make, like, a lot of money.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.330
I could make, like,
10,000 bucks probably.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.571
Yeah, no, not that much,

03:26.696 --> 03:27.958
but, like, a healthy profit.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.107
You know what?
I'll do it.

03:30.232 --> 03:31.776
- Yes!
- I need money, actually.

03:31.901 --> 03:34.422
Because I've recently given
a ton of money to charity, so...

03:34.588 --> 03:35.532
- that's awesome, man.
- Good for you, man.

03:35.657 --> 03:37.259
- Just kidding.
- Blake!

03:37.425 --> 03:38.426
Where the hell are you?

03:38.592 --> 03:41.353
I need a toasted bagel
with salmon cream cheese

03:41.478 --> 03:42.556
and my yerba mate.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.955
Coming, Alice.
[Chuckles]

03:44.080 --> 03:45.725
- Coming at ya.
- Oh.

03:45.891 --> 03:48.848
Hey, Dark... Jenny, it's Anders.

03:48.973 --> 03:49.995
Oh, hey.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.197
Just calling to apologize
about last night.

03:52.322 --> 03:54.985
Um, I was hoping
I could make it up to you

03:55.151 --> 03:57.237
- this evening.
- I can't tonight.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.970
I'm gonna wait in line
for <i>Code Of Ronin:</i>

03:59.095 --> 04:00.365
<i>Undead Apocalypse.</i>

04:00.531 --> 04:02.307
<i>Code Of Ronin?</i>
Yeah, I know it

04:02.432 --> 04:03.909
'cause my roommates are gonna
go wait in line for it.

04:04.034 --> 04:05.243
You don't have to.

04:05.368 --> 04:07.078
They'll just pick you up
a copy and, uh,

04:07.203 --> 04:08.613
since you'll be at my house already,

04:08.738 --> 04:10.215
they can just give it
to you late night.

04:10.340 --> 04:11.682
Hey!

04:11.807 --> 04:13.518
Did you punk bitches
take my salmon cream cheese?

04:13.643 --> 04:15.253
No, I haven't seen it.
Good luck.

04:15.378 --> 04:18.390
Anyway, so it'll just be me and you,

04:18.515 --> 04:20.202
- you and me and...
- Yoo-hoo.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.052
That shit was from Noah's!

04:22.177 --> 04:23.641
I ain't gonna let you chitchat

04:23.766 --> 04:24.796
till you get me my cream cheese.

04:24.921 --> 04:27.350
Hello, hey!
Hey, girl!

04:27.516 --> 04:28.810
Hey, girl, he got baby balls!

04:28.976 --> 04:31.229
Jesus.
What's all that noise?

04:31.395 --> 04:33.273
I'm watching an episode of <i>Martin.</i>

04:33.439 --> 04:36.151
- There.
- This ain't my cream cheese.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.642
And it's definitely not
salmon-flavored.

04:37.767 --> 04:38.737
But I don't...

04:38.903 --> 04:40.278
look, Tez, please.

04:40.403 --> 04:41.746
I'm desperately trying
to get this goth girl

04:41.871 --> 04:43.248
over to my house tonight
to get a little freaky.

04:43.373 --> 04:44.983
Oh, goth girl?
Well, you should've said that

04:45.108 --> 04:46.351
from jump, fool.

04:46.476 --> 04:48.413
Okay, this is what
I want you to tell her.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.989
You gonna tell her you have
a gang of Tanqueray

04:51.114 --> 04:53.084
and some bubonic chronic.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.792
- I am not saying that.
- You tell her...

04:54.917 --> 04:56.561
hello, are you still there?

04:56.686 --> 04:57.895
Yeah, no, no, I'm here.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.998
Um, hey, about tonight, I've got, uh,

05:00.123 --> 05:03.136
a gang of Tanqueray
and some bubonic chronic.

05:03.302 --> 05:05.347
Good enough for me.

05:05.513 --> 05:06.838
- It worked.
- You damn right it worked.

05:06.963 --> 05:07.849
That's crazy.

05:08.015 --> 05:09.559
It's been a while for you, huh?

05:09.725 --> 05:10.685
It's been so long.

05:10.851 --> 05:12.910
[Phone vibrates]

05:13.035 --> 05:14.346
All right, all right, all right.

05:14.471 --> 05:16.524
Yeah, yeah.
[Phone vibrates]

05:16.772 --> 05:17.943
Ch'ello?

05:18.109 --> 05:20.904
Yo, blazer, I am lost, dude.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.153
Okay, all right, all right.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.455
What street are you on?

05:23.580 --> 05:26.326
Uh, looks like maple Avenue.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.460
Okay, yes, yes, good, good.
That's perfect.

05:28.585 --> 05:29.794
You're in the right direction.

05:29.919 --> 05:31.296
Just keep heading north, okay?

05:31.421 --> 05:32.663
And you're gonna see a line.

05:32.788 --> 05:33.931
And there's gonna be a bunch

05:34.056 --> 05:35.533
of real gnar brajes and brajettes

05:35.658 --> 05:36.794
dressed like samurai zombies.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.046
You can't miss it.
It's a lot of fun.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.839
All right.
Brajes and...

05:40.005 --> 05:42.440
were you planning
on bringing me my food

05:42.565 --> 05:43.927
at any point today?

05:44.093 --> 05:46.444
I was.
Um, and...

05:46.569 --> 05:48.746
[imitates trumpet]

05:48.871 --> 05:50.581
The queen's breakfast,

05:50.706 --> 05:53.184
a plain bagel
with salmon cream cheese.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.354
I said toasted.

05:54.877 --> 05:57.607
Does that... does that
look toasted to you?

05:58.148 --> 06:00.151
No.

06:00.317 --> 06:01.945
Now bring me one that's toasted.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.571
You know, you are worse than Jillian,

06:03.737 --> 06:06.199
and she might have Asperger's.

06:06.365 --> 06:10.268
I'm allowed
to break your face, Blake.

06:10.393 --> 06:12.539
Can I have my phone back?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.499
Oh, Ders, man.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.250
- I'm glad you called, dude.
- Hey.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.128
I was sensing,
like, some really weird vibes

06:18.294 --> 06:19.577
between us, you know, almost like

06:19.702 --> 06:21.214
we weren't friends or something.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.466
- I-I like you, dude.
- Really?

06:23.632 --> 06:25.583
'Cause you didn't give
to my Kickstarter, man,

06:25.708 --> 06:27.018
and that really bummed me out.

06:27.143 --> 06:29.097
I needed 4 gs to buy Funyuns.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.808
Oh, you had a Kickstarter
to buy Funyuns, the company?

06:31.974 --> 06:33.768
No, dude, I just wanted
to buy Hella Funyuns, man.

06:33.934 --> 06:35.895
- How about the weed, Karl?
- Oh, yeah, for sure, for sure.

06:36.061 --> 06:37.562
- There you go, eighth-ola.
- Hey!

06:37.687 --> 06:39.264
Good, now listen,
that's for free, okay?

06:39.389 --> 06:40.692
That's the friend-o price, all right?

06:40.956 --> 06:42.467
And since we're friends now,
I was wondering

06:42.592 --> 06:44.335
if you'd like to go
check out a model train show

06:44.460 --> 06:45.989
with me tonight.
It'd be cool.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.158
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.701
I can't.
I'm so sorry.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.009
Any other time, I swear to God, okay?

06:52.134 --> 06:53.811
Oh, dude, tomorrow night
I'm gonna roast a bowl,

06:53.936 --> 06:55.513
and then there's
this big hide-and-seek game

06:55.638 --> 06:58.043
down at the quarry, man.
You'd love it.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.551
- Let's go check your calendar.
- No, no, no.

06:59.676 --> 07:01.086
The calendar... there's nothing
on the calendar.

07:01.211 --> 07:02.720
Oh, um, that's my boss!

07:02.845 --> 07:04.089
You gotta get out of here!

07:04.214 --> 07:05.408
Mr. Womano, there's a homeless guy.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.260
- I'm taking care of it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

So I'ma do this first.

15:49.139 --> 15:50.575
I'm gonna rub it
and tantalize it a little bit.

15:50.741 --> 15:51.817
Then I'm gonna grab the other one.

15:51.942 --> 15:53.285
- Okay. [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.621
You got some...
you got some awesome tits.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.581
Yeah.
[Stammers]

15:56.747 --> 15:58.124
This is some B.S.

15:58.682 --> 16:02.503
I am sick of guys like that
walking all over us.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.463
Some people are lords of the pit.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.432
Others, like you and me,

16:06.557 --> 16:09.093
Thrulls, born to be sacrificed.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.803
I'm a force of nature, man.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.496
- I'm an avatar of might.
- Well...

16:14.097 --> 16:15.141
I'ma trample this guy.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.934
Come on.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.243
Dude, how have you not seen

16:18.368 --> 16:19.912
my chemical romance live, dude?

16:20.037 --> 16:21.188
Excuse me.

16:21.572 --> 16:24.517
The way you were acting
earlier was unacceptable.

16:24.642 --> 16:28.421
So unless you wanna see
how really super tough I am,

16:28.546 --> 16:30.448
I suggest you let us back in line.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.782
[Spits]

16:31.948 --> 16:32.950
Eww.

16:33.116 --> 16:37.195
Or what?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.532
[Both screaming]

16:39.657 --> 16:41.918
- Yeah!
- Aah!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.878
Ahh!
[Exhales]

16:44.044 --> 16:46.088
Fine, man, take the spot, whatever.

16:46.254 --> 16:47.339
Yeah!
[Laughs]

16:47.464 --> 16:48.674
That was awesome.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.551
Thanks.
Yeah, I'm a hero, man.

16:50.717 --> 16:52.277
Feels good. It feels good.
It feels hood.

16:52.402 --> 16:55.648
[Screams]
There's a zombie apocalypse!

16:55.773 --> 16:57.249
- Aah, zombies!
- Watch where you're going.

16:57.374 --> 16:58.651
Zombies!

16:58.776 --> 17:00.770
I don't take that shit no more.

17:07.971 --> 17:09.481
{pub}- Oh, lick it.
- Yeah.

17:09.606 --> 17:11.364
- Oh, yeah.
- Is that what you want?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.085
- [Moans]
- Like that?

17:13.210 --> 17:14.386
- Mm, Ders.
- Ow!

17:14.511 --> 17:16.454
Too rough, okay.

17:16.579 --> 17:17.823
Well, dude, I'm sorry.
But you know what?

17:17.948 --> 17:19.372
You could be a little rougher.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.659
Fine, tell me how you like this.

17:20.784 --> 17:22.255
- That's it.
- How do you like that?

17:22.380 --> 17:23.584
- Does that hurt?
- That's what's up.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.377
Okay, now I want you both to take off

17:25.544 --> 17:26.665
the rest of your clothes so that

17:26.790 --> 17:28.130
I could get involved.

17:28.296 --> 17:29.534
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, totally.

17:29.659 --> 17:31.336
I have to draw the line.
This is... don't.

17:31.461 --> 17:32.838
- Hey.
- Nope, this is happening.

17:32.963 --> 17:34.173
This is happening, bud.
We're doing this.

17:34.298 --> 17:36.013
- I can't do this.
- Okay.

17:36.179 --> 17:39.141
Here, why don't you
put my teeny-tiny panties

17:39.307 --> 17:41.180
- in your mouth?
- Okay, this I like.

17:41.305 --> 17:43.894
You are creative.
Move over, Karl.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.231
Come on in. Come on in.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.720
[Chuckles]
Ooh.

17:47.845 --> 17:50.319
But first...

17:50.485 --> 17:53.364
Oh, yeah, no vision allowed.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.195
Oh, blindfolding me, okay.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.896
Cool.
I want no sight.

17:58.021 --> 18:00.579
Yeah, hiding the senses. Ow.

18:00.745 --> 18:02.467
This is freakin'
kink central right here.

18:02.592 --> 18:04.417
- Feed me, baby.
- I love it.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.670
My panties in your mouth.

18:05.795 --> 18:07.005
Yeah, feed me, baby.

18:07.130 --> 18:08.774
- Open wide.
- Mm-hmm.

18:09.045 --> 18:10.175
[Both moan]

18:10.300 --> 18:12.049
- Yum.
- [Muffled] Baby.

18:12.215 --> 18:13.175
Oh, what do they taste like?

18:13.341 --> 18:14.471
Butterscotch, baby.

18:14.596 --> 18:16.014
- Let me taste a little bit.
- Mm-mm, no, you wait.

18:16.139 --> 18:17.249
- Come on, let me taste.
- Stop it.

18:17.374 --> 18:18.516
- Come on, man.
- Oh, here we go.

18:18.641 --> 18:19.952
Where's she at?
I found her.

18:20.077 --> 18:21.976
Here I am, guys.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.123
- She's right here.
- Marco polo.

18:24.248 --> 18:26.188
[Laughter]

18:26.416 --> 18:27.726
Oh, my God.

18:27.851 --> 18:29.108
[Muffled]
Marco boner.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.152
- [Cell phone chimes]
- Oh, I'm in.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.014
She's getting a little hot, huh?

18:33.139 --> 18:34.499
- I think I found a butt.
- Oh, yeah?

18:34.624 --> 18:36.068
Is he touching your butt?

18:36.193 --> 18:38.284
'Cause that's cool, and I like it.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.671
- [Both moaning]
- She's great.

18:39.796 --> 18:41.606
Oh, yeah, you guys, I'm so close.

18:41.731 --> 18:43.008
- You like that?
- Oh, she's gonna go.

18:43.133 --> 18:44.409
- She's gonna blast.
- Magic fingers.

18:44.534 --> 18:45.916
[Moans]

18:47.085 --> 18:48.810
<i>If you were hoping to get a copy</i>

18:48.935 --> 18:51.197
<i>of the popular video game</i>
Code Of Ronin,

18:51.322 --> 18:52.610
<i>you're in for a disappointment.</i>

18:52.735 --> 18:54.553
<i>The game's release will be delayed</i>

18:54.678 --> 18:57.055

19:01.712 --> 19:02.641
What the hell?

19:02.807 --> 19:05.130
Oh, my God. You're munching
on my undies, dude.

19:05.255 --> 19:07.766
[Screams, spitting]

19:07.891 --> 19:10.357
- Whoa.
- No, no, no, no!

19:10.523 --> 19:12.359
Jesus. I wouldn't have
put those in my mouth.

19:12.525 --> 19:15.571
Get away from me.
[Spitting]

19:15.737 --> 19:18.282
All right, losers, I'm out of here.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.077
What?
You knew the entire time?

19:21.243 --> 19:22.787
Yeah, duh, I knew.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.538
I pegged you as smart.

19:24.704 --> 19:26.698
And if you ever call me again,

19:26.823 --> 19:29.254
I will upload this to burning camel.

19:29.379 --> 19:31.378
- No!
- So what?

19:31.544 --> 19:32.713
It wouldn't be my first video.

19:32.879 --> 19:33.923
Bye.

19:34.284 --> 19:36.092
[Groans]
Oh!

19:36.258 --> 19:37.796
Oh, my God.
They're soggy, dude.

19:37.921 --> 19:40.679
Jeez, you were working
with some kissing juices, man.

19:40.845 --> 19:43.168
- I know.
- That's real.

19:43.293 --> 19:44.308
[Sighs]
Oh, my God.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.505
- Yeah! Oh, man.
- Yeah!

19:47.630 --> 19:50.032
It felt so good standing up
for myself today, man.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.410
I just wish Marshall
wouldn't have fell

19:52.535 --> 19:53.745
on his sword, that sucked.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.647
PCP, man, one hell of a drug.

19:55.772 --> 19:57.738
Can't feel anything on it.

19:57.904 --> 19:58.683
- Coming at ya.
- Yep.

19:58.808 --> 20:00.986
Uh-oh.
All: Ooh!

20:01.111 --> 20:02.888
That one's gonna sting tomorrow,

20:03.013 --> 20:04.522
but right now, it feels amazing.

20:04.647 --> 20:06.558
- No way.
- Yes. Yes, way.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.493
- Yeah, there's blood.
- Yeah. I'm bleeding?

20:08.618 --> 20:09.875
- Yeah, it's through the shirt.
- You know what?

20:10.041 --> 20:11.710
I think we should move this
to the face.

20:11.876 --> 20:13.165
- Okay, sure.
- Let do...

20:13.290 --> 20:15.172
I mean, we should be recording this.

20:15.338 --> 20:16.799
Yeah.
You guys had a weird night.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.759
Nothing weird happened here.

20:18.925 --> 20:19.972
- Cool.
- Great.

20:20.097 --> 20:21.554
I thought we were doing my thing.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.774
- [Knock at door]
- Someone's at the door.

20:22.899 --> 20:24.682
You just got saved.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.976
Saved by the knock is what
I would call it.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.714
Hey, man, as a friend,
I wanted to tell you first.

20:29.839 --> 20:32.606
I banged the darkness, I did.

20:32.772 --> 20:34.650
She was waiting for a cab,
and I hit her in the bushes.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.193
No, you didn't.

20:36.359 --> 20:38.195
- Smell, dude.
- I'm not...

20:38.361 --> 20:39.196
take a whiff.

20:39.749 --> 20:42.327
[Sniffs]
Aw, damn it!

20:42.452 --> 20:44.577
Dude, that smells good.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.828
- Does it?
- Yeah.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.663
Those fingers were in my butt, man.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.967
- What?
- I got you.

20:49.092 --> 20:50.207
- Come on, man! Dude!
- I got you, dude!

20:50.373 --> 20:51.336
I didn't actually "f" her.

20:51.461 --> 20:53.238
So what's, uh...
[Stammering]

20:53.363 --> 20:54.461
