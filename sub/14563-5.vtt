WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:11.470
- Hey, buddy, big day.
- No.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.263
- Big premiere day.
- Stop.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.724
<i>Secretariat </i>in theaters now.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.309
- How exciting.
- Please stop.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.977
People are seeing your movie,

00:19.061 --> 00:23.232
forming opinions, judging you,
all over the country.

00:23.315 --> 00:26.485
- What are you doing?
- Or not. Maybe nobody's seeing it.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.238
Wouldn't it be weird
if literally nobody saw your movie?

00:29.321 --> 00:30.906
How do I get out of this conversation?

00:30.989 --> 00:35.494
Just think: by this time tomorrow,
we'll know if it's a hit or a flop.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.788
The air crackles with possibilities.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.541
- Oh, good lord.
- Uh-oh.

00:40.624 --> 00:44.336
It's all over. My career is gone.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.505
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.133
Wasn't <i>Secretariat </i>a big hit
at the Pacific Ocean Film Festival?

00:50.217 --> 00:52.427
Critics called it,
"Gurgle glub glub blub blub."

00:52.511 --> 00:54.137
Festivals don't matter, Todd.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.515
It's so you can get some leaves
on your poster.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.433
But this is the real world now.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.018
If this doesn't hit big this weekend--

01:00.102 --> 01:02.938
- It's-- Oh! Oh, God.
- Oh, no!

01:03.021 --> 01:05.315
BoJack, it's gonna be okay.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.696
BoJack, the East Coast box office is in.

01:10.779 --> 01:14.157
<i>Secretariat </i>is, wait for it...

01:14.241 --> 01:16.910
- a huge success!
- Why would you make me wait for it?

01:16.994 --> 01:18.996
That was a terrible time
for a "wait for it."

01:19.079 --> 01:20.706
Do you know what this means?

01:20.789 --> 01:23.959
You're no longer just some TV actor
they threw into a movie,

01:24.042 --> 01:27.546
<i>you're a bona fide movie...</i>
<i>wait for it, star.</i>

01:28.130 --> 01:30.549
BoJack, how do you feel?

01:31.341 --> 01:33.427
Awesome.

01:35.137 --> 01:41.810
<i>♪♪</i>

02:28.857 --> 02:33.153
We defy odds,
we face challenges with valor,

02:33.236 --> 02:35.030
and we never give in.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.616
For those reasons, and many more,

02:37.699 --> 02:42.079
our love is like the team
that inspired the movie <i>Cool Runnings.</i>

02:42.162 --> 02:45.248
If I may borrow
that film's promotional tag line,

02:45.332 --> 02:47.709
"Jamaican Bobsledders?"

02:47.793 --> 02:50.462
That's right, Diane.
"Jamaican bobsledders."

02:50.545 --> 02:52.214
Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.675
Thank <i>you,</i> Dr. Janet,
for Jamaican me open up like that.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.844
That took up most of the hour,

02:57.928 --> 03:01.056
but we do still have a little time
to hear from Diane.

03:01.139 --> 03:06.478
Mr. Peanutbutter, I think you are great.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.980
- Is that all?
- I'm sorry.

03:09.064 --> 03:12.901
I'm not always good at using words
to describe emotions.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.027
Aren't you a writer?

03:14.111 --> 03:18.573
Writer/social media coordinator/
director of New Media Outreach.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.491
Aah!

03:19.574 --> 03:24.037
That gentle sound tells us the sun has set
on our time together this week.

03:24.121 --> 03:28.792
But I remind you
of the importance of communication.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.919
It's the very blade of the bobsled.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.505
I'm not singling out either one of you,

03:33.588 --> 03:36.341
but I think for the next time,
some people here

03:36.425 --> 03:40.887
might want to work on putting
their thoughts and feelings into words,

03:40.971 --> 03:42.597
as a writer does.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.099
- Mmm?
- Mm-mmm.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.059
Ah.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.564
I settled on a company dental plan.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.150
It's called, "The tooth, the whole tooth,
and nothing but the tooth."

03:53.233 --> 03:56.069
- Seemed comprehensive.
- Not "tooth" shabby, Judah.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.155
Yes.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.657
I also wanted to talk to you,
if this is a good time,

04:00.741 --> 04:03.410
and it is, because you have exactly
nine minutes before your meeting

04:03.493 --> 04:06.079
on <i>Captain Hooker 2:</i>
<i>Yo Ho Ho Ho and A Bottle Of Booty.</i>

04:06.163 --> 04:07.330
Yeah, what's up?

04:07.414 --> 04:10.375
I've taken on duties beyond the scope
of my original contract.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.170
- I think I've proven my worth.
- Are you asking for a raise?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.590
A more elegant solution might involve
an ownership position in the company.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.425
I thought I'd ask for 15 percent stake,

04:18.508 --> 04:20.343
you'd counter with five,
we'd settle on ten.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.637
- Well, then, it's settled.
- I'll draw up the paperwork.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.765
Speaking of paper,
Piper Perabo and Pauley Perrette

04:24.848 --> 04:27.309
need to push back the pitch on
the <i>Princess and the Pauper </i>project.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.186
- You have a night off tonight.
- A night off?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.854
- When's the last time that happened?
- It hasn't.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.899
- Can I help you with anything else?
- Get me a date for tonight.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.150
Make that three dates.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.360
Who knows when I'll get another night off?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.237
I do. And you won't.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.202
Excuse me, my good man.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.454
My movie, starring me,
the movie star, just opened.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.581
We'd like to sit at the bar.
Drinks on the house.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.709
Of course, Mr. Horseman.
Right away, Mr. Horseman.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.714
Mr. Sutherland, I'm going to have
to ask you to give up your seat

04:57.798 --> 05:00.091
for a movie star and his companion.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.052
Yeah. Beat it, Kiefer.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.140
Wow!

05:07.224 --> 05:11.436
- They love you here.
- Everybody loves a movie star, Todd.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.147
I'm gonna get a lot of love.
I want you by my side,

05:14.231 --> 05:17.150
soaking up the spillover
and feasting on my discarded leftovers.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.735
Sounds great, Boj.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.530
Tonight, we're riding
a rocket straight into the sun.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.866
You won't get left on the launchpad
just because nobody knows your name.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.702
- Todd? Todd Chavez?
- I think you mean BoJack.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.204
- BoJack Horseman.
- Emily.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.998
No, BoJack. Why do people keep
saying names that aren't my name?

05:32.082 --> 05:35.877
I haven't seen you since high school.
You look great. I love the hat.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.879
Thanks. What brings you here?

05:37.963 --> 05:41.841
My dumb best friend's getting married,
so I'm here for the rehearsal dinner.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.844
Why is everybody not talking about me
for a moment? This is concerning.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.472
- Oh, my God. You're BoJack Horseman.
- Yeah, duh.

05:47.556 --> 05:51.601
I loved <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>
That is, like, my favorite show.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.271
- You mean <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
- No, <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:56.398
It was so dumb. It was the best.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.441
- Thank you?
- I mean, it was the worst.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.194
- But that's what made it so good.
- Yeah, I got it.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.281
I was laughing at it
because it was so bad, do you understand?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.992
- You're being very clear.
- I feel like I'm not articulating.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.995
My enjoyment didn't come
from a place of sincere admiration.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.456
It was more like,
"What an ill-conceived television show.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.793
Who made those terrible choices?
I can't stop watching."

06:16.876 --> 06:18.003
You don't have to keep--

06:18.086 --> 06:20.005
Anyway, I'm pretty much in love with you.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.674
Thanks. I love you.
By which I mean, you're terrible.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.176
I should get back
to this stupid rehearsal dinner.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.095
Todd, it was really great to see you.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.014
Wait, did you say there's a wedding?

06:29.097 --> 06:32.809
- I said "rehearsal dinner," but--
- Whoa! We gotta crash that.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.270
Boring regular people love it
when movie stars show up

06:35.353 --> 06:36.313
and drink their alcohol.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.231
They jizz their pants for that shit.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.359
- I don't know, BoJack.
- I'm sorry, Todd. Are you a movie star?

06:41.443 --> 06:45.739
I did narrate a Mazda commercial.
Funny story how that came together.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.742
This is not the time for one
of your weird stories that go nowhere.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.579
- We've got a wedding to crash.
- It's a rehearsal dinner.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.626
It just doesn't come easy for me,
like it does for you.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.087
Communication is a process.
That's why we're going to Dr. Janet.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.923
- That, and there was a Groupon.
- You had a model growing up.

07:04.007 --> 07:07.302
You had a house filled with love,
parents who said nice things to you,

07:07.385 --> 07:11.097
and the beautiful verdant hillsides
of the Labrador Peninsula.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.644
I didn't have Diane Peninsula.
I had the Isthmus of Assholes.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.355
I keep telling you
we should go visit the old country.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.982
You'd love it up there.
There's so much to smell.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.442
That's weird.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.986
I just got a text from Alexi Brosefino.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.322
The famous movie star and man about town?

07:27.405 --> 07:30.492
He wants me to come to his house
and party with his friends.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.701
The Snatch Batch?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.871
Alexi Brosefino wants <i>you </i>to party
with the Snatch Batch?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.540
He's one of our clients.
I met him a couple weeks ago.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.960
We talked about me
Instagramming one of his parties.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.170
I didn't think he actually wanted me
to do it tonight.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.630
Oh, wait. Tonight?

07:43.713 --> 07:46.466
I hoped we could snuggle up
on the couch and watch <i>Bones.</i>

07:46.549 --> 07:48.802
I don't think that show's about
what you think it's about.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.638
Besides, I have to go.
It's for work. I'm sorry.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.099
It's fine. But you'll call me
if you're out late, right?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.685
- Yes. I'll call you.
- Okay. Have a good time.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.186
Ugh! I'm sure I won't.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.730
Cool guys like that
take me back to high school

08:00.814 --> 08:03.441
and I end up feeling
like a huge nerd over again.

08:03.525 --> 08:09.406
The only kind of nerd you should feel like
is hon-nerd that he selected you.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.621
Princess Carolyn, I made reservations
for you tonight at Elefante.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.164
- Reservations?
- For your dates.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.333
One at seven,
one at 8:30, and one at ten.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.876
You actually got me three dates?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.420
- I was joking.
- I'm sorry.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.005
I sometimes have trouble reading tone.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.173
Once I spent 45 minutes
at a fascinating lecture

08:27.257 --> 08:29.759
at the Apollo Theater
before I realized it was a comedy routine.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.430
I can't go on three dates.
Can we reschedule two of them?

08:33.513 --> 08:36.224
It will be a long time
before you get another night off.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.519
Especially since you have those lawyers
coming next week to change light bulbs.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.647
Okay, I just realized now
that was also a joke.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.862
As the father of one of the brides,
I just wanted to take a moment to--

08:49.487 --> 08:51.156
<i>Buenas noches, amigos.</i>

08:51.239 --> 08:54.951
Let's get blasted. Right?

08:55.035 --> 08:58.121
Oh, my God, BoJack Horseman.
The movie star.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.457
This is the happiest day of my life.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.715
Ooh.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.719
- Can I help you?
- I'm Diane.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.721
- Um...
- I work for Princess Carolyn.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.557
You texted me to come hang out
with you and your friends.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.603
- I'm running out of things to say.
- Oh, yeah. Diane.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.521
Yeah, no, of course. Come in, please.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.276
- Holy shit. Is that a Klimt?
- Hey, guys, we got a guest.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.987
Diane, this is Carlos, David,
and Shitshow.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.280
- Yo.
- Word.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.282
Ah, the famous Snatch Batch.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.160
That's just a dumb name
some reporter came up with.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.745
We don't actually call ourselves that.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.498
We all have sex with a lot of women.
But who cares?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.166
We also love getting brunch.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.376
You might as well call us
the Brunch Batch.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.544
Or the Brunch Bunch.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.547
Oh, my God, Carlos,
that's why you're the funny one.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.341
That is really good.
Write that one down.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.762
Yeah, we get why the Casanova narrative
is appealing and how it helps our brand.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.057
- We're not complete idiots.
- Yeah, except for Shitshow.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.435
Good one.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.896
But within each man
lives a great multiplicity, right?

10:04.979 --> 10:08.233
- Nobody is just one thing.
- Yeah, except for Shitshow, right?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.735
Ah...

10:10.819 --> 10:14.697
You know, we can make fun of him
because, like, he's our friend.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.283
I am so sorry, Shitshow.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.581
But the modern era of automotive glass

10:23.665 --> 10:27.335
began when engineers
took two panes of laminated glass

10:27.418 --> 10:30.296
and separated them
with a thin layer of PVB.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.508
- Uh-huh.
- How about you? Are you in the industry?

10:33.591 --> 10:36.594
- Yes, actually. I'm an agent.
- Agent?

10:36.678 --> 10:39.097
Oh, you're in the entertainment industry.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.350
When I said the industry,
I meant the auto glass industry.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.977
We call our business the industry

10:44.060 --> 10:46.563
because we think
we're more important than everybody else.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.990
I could bore everyone to death
about how proud I am

10:57.073 --> 10:58.992
of the woman Taneisha's become,

10:59.075 --> 11:01.119
but rather than read the remarks
I've been preparing

11:01.202 --> 11:03.705
for the last eight months,
I'm gonna turn the microphone over

11:03.788 --> 11:07.709
to an honest to God movie star,
BoJack Horseman, ladies and gentlemen.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.462
Thank you, thank you.
Let's get to the reason we're here.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.965
And no, Uncle George,
I don't mean the chocolate fountain.

11:15.842 --> 11:20.972
You know, I don't know
Karen and Taneisha super well,

11:21.055 --> 11:24.183
but I do know how precious and rare it is

11:24.267 --> 11:27.937
to find that one missing puzzle piece
who completes you.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.190
And when you know, you know.
You know?

11:31.816 --> 11:35.570
So congrats to the happy couple
for knowing.

11:35.653 --> 11:39.782
Okay, as they say in the movie business,
"That's a wrap on BoJack."

11:39.866 --> 11:42.368
Let's hear it
from some of these bridesmaids.

11:42.952 --> 11:49.250
- Taneisha, Karen.
- Taneisha... Karen...

11:49.334 --> 11:52.503
On the way here, the driver stopped
in some weird parking lot

11:52.587 --> 11:54.339
and asked if he could touch my hair.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.090
- That's terrifying.
- I know.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.967
It is a very popular ride-sharing app,

11:58.051 --> 11:59.928
you'd think they could vet
their drivers better.

12:00.011 --> 12:00.845
Which app is that?

12:00.929 --> 12:03.765
I probably shouldn't say,
for legal reasons.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.934
I think we all know
which one I'm talking about.

12:06.017 --> 12:09.228
You know what would solve
a lot of problems?

12:09.312 --> 12:13.816
If there was a ride-share app for women
that only had women drivers.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.944
That is such a good idea, Todd.

12:16.027 --> 12:19.489
- You always did have such great ideas.
- You know what else would be cool?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.491
A miniature cupcake gun,

12:21.574 --> 12:24.869
so you could shoot tiny cupcakes
into your mouth.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.538
"Uh-oh! Is that guy
trying to kill himself?"

12:27.622 --> 12:29.707
"Nope, just a cupcake gun."

12:29.791 --> 12:31.751
Wait, no, go back to your other idea.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.420
- Which one?
- The one about the women drivers.

12:34.504 --> 12:39.509
Taneisha, and Karen.
Karen and Taneisha.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.722
And my foundation focuses
on clean water initiatives

12:44.806 --> 12:46.432
and that's actually how I met Carlos.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.893
He patented a process
for ionic remineralization.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.520
- It's crazy.
- That's incredible.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.523
Okay, enough shop talk. Let's roll.

12:53.606 --> 12:58.069
- Diane?
- Oh, drug taking. That's cool. I'm cool.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.154
What is this, Molly?

13:00.238 --> 13:02.699
Yeah, Diane, some drug dealer from 2013

13:02.782 --> 13:04.659
found a time machine
and gave us this Molly.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.829
- Nobody does Molly anymore.
- This is Gush.

13:07.912 --> 13:08.746
What's Gush?

13:08.830 --> 13:12.375
Look, Diane, I get that
this is maybe not your usual scene.

13:12.458 --> 13:16.587
- So don't feel like you have to do any--
- No, no, I can hang. Let's do drugs.

13:16.671 --> 13:20.967
Let's put the drug in my mouth,
so I can trip or roll or gush or--

13:21.050 --> 13:23.970
Oh, you all did it. Uh...

13:25.722 --> 13:29.517
Here we go.
Oh, it doesn't hit right away, does it?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.978
- No, it'll take a few minutes.
- Okay.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.190
So how'd you guys meet Shitshow?

13:36.274 --> 13:38.192
We went to his TED Talk.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.657
Oh, it is so great
to finally date a woman my age.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.285
- Yes.
- Who's comfortable in her own skin.

13:47.368 --> 13:51.914
I always say, there's more than one way
for a cat... you know, to have skin.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.584
And has come to terms
with not having children.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.086
What makes you think
I don't want to have children?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.881
Oh, come on.
What are you, serious? At your age?

13:59.964 --> 14:03.092
Since when are you an expert
on who can and cannot have children?

14:03.176 --> 14:06.345
I'm a gynecologist.
I specialize in fertility.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.265
I'd be happy to put you in the stirrups,
look at the old cat eggs.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.102
Ecch! Not if you were the last albino
rhino gyno on the planet.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.730
I'm the only albino rhino gyno I know.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.776
- Should we get some wine?
- Oh, great. You're also a wine addict.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.527
Oh, yeah!

14:21.611 --> 14:24.781
So to do a soft launch,
I think we'd only need about ten cars.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.866
I could work out any bugs with the app.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.118
You really know what you're talking about.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.996
So, do you think
your girlfriend would get jealous

14:32.080 --> 14:33.873
if we started this project together, or...

14:33.956 --> 14:38.711
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing for you,
but I actually don't have a girlfriend.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.381
That's a really weird assumption
for you to make.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.549
You look really dumb right now.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.886
No, actually, I was kind of hoping
you weren't seeing anybody.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.306
I'm also not seeing anybody,
for what it's worth.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.393
- Ohh.
- Hey, Todd, you must be a real cool dude

14:53.476 --> 14:56.312
if a movie star wants to hang out
with you for no reason.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.190
Just wanted to give you
a key to the room I booked,

14:59.273 --> 15:01.109
which nobody is in right now.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.027
- Winkity dinkity.
- BoJack.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.613
Maybe you two
should just go see if the bed works.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.157
A lot of these rooms have faulty beds.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.118
- That's a great idea.
- Uh, yeah.

15:10.201 --> 15:13.538
Okay, let me just finish
this cocktail real quick.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.666
- Uh...
- All right, Todd. Yeah, go.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.670
Ahh! Cool, I'm just gonna get
one or two more drinks

15:20.753 --> 15:22.630
and then we'll go check out that bed.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.424
Okay.

15:24.507 --> 15:30.179
Um... hello, everybody. I was thinking
about what BoJack said before.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.640
About how when you know, you know.

15:32.723 --> 15:36.936
And I'm sitting there,
and I'm thinking, "Do I know?"

15:37.019 --> 15:39.272
- Uh...
- I mean, I think I know.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.358
But if you know when you know
and I only think that I know,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.861
maybe that means that I don't know, right?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.529
- Oh, boy.
- Karen, I'm sorry.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.948
I love you, but I can't do this.
The wedding's off.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.202
- It's a rehearsal dinner.
- Thank you, BoJack.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.165
Uh...

16:01.335 --> 16:03.880
I don't think it's working.
Am I doing this wrong?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.756
Am I doing drugs wrong?

16:05.840 --> 16:08.134
Alexi, did you hear back
from that piece you texted?

16:08.217 --> 16:10.386
- Mm-mmm! Mm-mmm.
- "That piece"?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.889
That girl was hot.
What was her name again?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.725
Doesn't matter.
I mean, let's just enjoy ourselves, right?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.185
- Diane?
- What?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.312
No, the hot girl. Her name was Diane.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.607
You saved her in your phone
as Cool Sexy Diane.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.442
Let's just, like, drop it, now.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.945
That's funny.
You have two friends named Diane.

16:28.029 --> 16:31.365
You know, I also know Diane Lane.
So, there's that.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.534
Why are we talking about other Dianes?

16:33.618 --> 16:36.787
Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if you tried to text Cool Sexy Diane,

16:36.871 --> 16:40.249
but then instead you texted
Regular Boring Diane by mistake?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.169
And then I showed up
and you were like, "Who's this chick?"

16:43.252 --> 16:45.338
All night, I'd be hanging out with you,

16:45.421 --> 16:48.299
thinking I was one of the gang,
but it was just a big mistake

16:48.382 --> 16:51.177
because you meant to text--
Oh, shit, that's exactly what happened.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.096
Wait, Diane, please hear me out...

16:55.097 --> 16:56.307
Whoa.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.395
Oh, shit. It's hitting. I gotta go.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.067
- Diane, wait. Come on.
- I get it, okay?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.569
You're the cool kids. I'm the nerd.
I should have known.

17:08.653 --> 17:12.448
So I texted the wrong person. So what?
This isn't high school.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.493
There's no nerds and no cool kids.
We're all adults.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.537
We're hanging out together
and having a good time.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.665
- So just come back inside.
- Everyone knows I don't belong there.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.626
Hey, you belong
wherever you want to belong, Diane.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.670
- Yeah?
- Yeah, look at me.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.839
I'm a handsome white guy
and I never feel like I don't belong.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.675
Also, you took a shit ton of gush.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.261
- Things are about to get insane.
- I just took one pill.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.263
Yeah, that's a shit ton.

17:35.346 --> 17:38.683
- My jeans feel amazing right now.
- That is great.

17:38.766 --> 17:42.353
I feel so much love.
I got to tell someone.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.897
Yes, yes, tell me.
I'm in this with you, Diane.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.526
No. I got to go home.
I got to tell my husband.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.736
Wait, Diane.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.864
That tree is amazing.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.243
Ugh!

17:59.161 --> 18:02.248
- Princess Carolyn?
- You've got to be kidding me.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.001
- You're a cat.
- And you're a mouse.

18:05.084 --> 18:09.005
I think I know how this ends.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.341
Let's not waste each other's time
and cut right to the chase.

18:12.425 --> 18:17.138
- It was nice to meet you, uh...?
- Ralph Stilton. It was nice to meet you.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.307
May all your disasters
be this easy to avoid.

18:19.390 --> 18:22.685
If I have one more bad date...

18:22.768 --> 18:24.562
Oh! I am right there with you.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.106
Date canceled.
I could use a bite to eat, though.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.941
There's this great place
around the corner.

18:29.025 --> 18:32.695
It's a little hole in the wall,
but they do a nice cheese plate.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.946
Hmm.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.536
Wow. Weird turn of events, huh?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.413
Nobody's fault, right?
I'm gonna jet.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.332
You need to talk some sense
into my daughter.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.959
Yeah, talking sense into people
isn't really my thing.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.711
In fact, I'm better at the opposite.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.505
I once got Nic Cage to buy
Charlie Chaplin's mustache on eBay.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.798
That was his last ten bucks.

18:52.882 --> 18:57.136
Please, BoJack. She'll listen to you.
Everyone loves the movie star.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.849
Uh... hey, laundry cart.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.602
Want to hide in sheets
and pretend we're ghosts?

19:04.685 --> 19:07.396
No, Todd, I don't want to pretend
like we're ghosts.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.566
I want to go in the hotel room
and fool around. Do you?

19:10.650 --> 19:14.403
I don't know, Emily.
Uh, you're pretty drunk.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.864
No, I'm-- I'm not. I'm not drunk at all.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.742
- Oh, well, I'm pretty drunk.
- Yeah, but it seems like you're--

19:19.825 --> 19:21.786
Maybe I should just go to bed.

19:21.869 --> 19:26.332
- I'm, uh, I'm feeling kind of sick.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.417
But, hey, it was really great seeing you.

19:28.501 --> 19:32.421
- Yeah, it was great seeing you too.
- Yeah, yeah, good night.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.132
What?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.387
My arm is stuck in the trap

19:39.470 --> 19:43.057
and I'm running around the kitchen
like crazy, smearing blood everywhere.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.268
Oh, this is me.

19:46.352 --> 19:50.189
I think as far as disasters go,
that was one of the better ones.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.982
It's the best non-date I've ever had.

19:52.066 --> 19:55.611
Yeah, I was thinking,
maybe some time we should have a--

19:55.695 --> 19:58.322
- What's the opposite of a non-date?
- A date.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.282
- That's the word.
- I'd like that.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.243
Well, great, great.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.245
When can I see you again?
When's your next night off?

20:04.328 --> 20:05.162
Oh.

20:05.246 --> 20:08.124
Did I say something? Is it because
I asked for the glass of milk?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.376
- If you give me a cookie--
- No, you're great.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.462
It's just running an agency
doesn't give me a lot of nights off.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.757
Tell you what, here's my card.
If you're ever free, give me a call.

20:16.841 --> 20:20.052
If not, I'll just meet somebody else
and invite you to the wedding.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.848
- Oh, thanks.
- You don't have to come, but send a gift.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.647
- Hey, Taneisha?
- BoJack?

20:31.731 --> 20:34.483
- I was thinking about what you said--
- Stop doing that.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.736
Nobody should be thinking
about the things I say.

20:36.819 --> 20:41.824
- I love Karen. But does she complete me?
- Taneisha, nobody completes anybody.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.242
That's not a real thing.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.661
If you're lucky enough to find someone
you can halfway tolerate,

20:45.745 --> 20:47.955
sink your nails in and don't let go,
no matter what.

20:48.038 --> 20:52.042
- So, what, I should just settle?
- Yes, thank you, exactly. Settle.

20:52.126 --> 20:56.630
Because otherwise you're just gonna
get older, and harder, and more alone.

20:56.714 --> 21:00.050
And you're gonna do everything you can
to fill that hole, with friends,

21:00.134 --> 21:05.097
and your career, and meaningless sex,
but the hole doesn't get filled.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.809
One day, you're gonna look around
and you're going to realize

21:08.893 --> 21:12.688
that everybody loves you,
but nobody likes you.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.358
And that is the loneliest feeling
in the world.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.574
The wedding is back on.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.535
I love you, baby. I always knew I did.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.247
- This is the happiest day of my life.
- Yeah.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.044
<i>Sometimes, the only way</i>
<i>to solve a crime is with bones.</i>

21:36.086 --> 21:39.590
<i>Hey, if you love bones so much,</i>
<i>maybe we should just call you "Bones."</i>

21:39.673 --> 21:41.342
Bones.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.802
<i>To the Bones Mobile.</i>

21:42.885 --> 21:45.805
Mr. Peabut Nutter.
Mr. Peeper Number.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.724
Diane? Are you okay?

21:48.808 --> 21:50.351
The drugs have something to say.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.186
And even though they are drugs,

21:52.269 --> 21:55.314
they come from science,
so let's give a listen.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.483
Okay.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.485
I know I don't always have
the right words,

21:59.568 --> 22:01.153
I don't always have the right feelings,

22:01.237 --> 22:04.198
but I love you so much
and I need you to know that.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.449
Yeah, I know.

22:05.533 --> 22:09.036
And sometimes I think that I know myself,
but maybe that's a trap.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.997
Because maybe I <i>am </i>Cool Sexy Diane,

22:12.081 --> 22:14.458
or Really In Touch
With Her Feelings Diane.

22:14.542 --> 22:18.671
Or possibly other Dianes
we don't even know about yet.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.258
The point is, I'm all of the Dianes.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.802
I know exactly what you're talking about.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.680
I love that you do crazy things
that make no sense,

22:27.763 --> 22:29.932
like fill our house up
with spaghetti strainers.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.727
I had a very good reason for that,
but I do not remember what it was.

22:33.811 --> 22:38.440
And we're really good for each other.
Or at least, you're good for me.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.901
And you're fun. And you're sweet.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.404
And I love you. And I need you.

22:43.487 --> 22:47.116
And I don't always know
how to tell you that. But drugs help.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.243
That's right, honey. Drugs are great.

22:49.326 --> 22:53.289
And now, I'm going to carry my man to bed.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.708
- Here we go.
- Oh, okay.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.502
Uh, is this a good idea?

22:58.586 --> 23:03.132
The drugs want me to do this,
and that means it's a good idea.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.425
- Aaah!
- Ohh!

23:04.508 --> 23:08.345
Ow!
Drugs, I thought we were friends.

23:10.973 --> 23:11.849
Oh.

23:11.932 --> 23:15.394
- Why were you working in the dark?
- Oh, I guess it got dark.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.106
- I didn't notice. How were your dates?
- Pointless.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.234
Yes, most dates are.
Well, I've prepared our agreement.

23:22.318 --> 23:25.195
- Look it over, sign it at your leisure.
- I don't have any leisure.

23:25.279 --> 23:28.073
While you're signing, I have a stack
of holiday cards for the staff.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.284
I took the liberty of writing
little personal messages

23:30.367 --> 23:31.952
- to everyone on your behalf.
- Thank you.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.454
Mm-hmm.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.725
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.983
- What's gonna happen tomorrow?
- I don't know.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.444
- Are we going to fight?
- No.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.947
We are. Drugs are gonna wear off
and I'm gonna be mean.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.825
- Why am I so mean?
- You're not mean.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.830
- Let's go to the Labrador Peninsula.
- Yeah?

24:16.914 --> 24:20.250
- Spend New Year's with your family.
- Oh, you are gonna love it up there.

24:20.334 --> 24:23.253
I have an uncle who still plays the flute
at the local pub every week.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.881
- I want to hear him.
- Ohh, you can't.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.175
- He plays in dog frequency.
- Aww.

24:28.258 --> 24:31.637
Well, your blood work looks good.
So go home.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.765
Oh, and, uh, lay off the drugs.
Especially now.

24:34.848 --> 24:38.936
- Why especially now?
- Oh, don't worry. Your baby's fine.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.271
What do you mean "baby"?
Why do you say "baby"?

24:41.355 --> 24:44.274
Do you not know?

24:44.358 --> 24:46.276
- You're pregnant.
