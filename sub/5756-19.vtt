WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.635
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:07.775 --> 00:09.475
( gasping )

00:10.845 --> 00:12.644
DON'T TELL.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.179
Hanna:
<i> I'M IN THE SHOWER, MOM.</i>

00:15.616 --> 00:17.149
Ashley: ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU AT DINNER.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.053
WANT TO SHARE
A TOWEL TOO?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.488
Toby:<i> 2-1-4.</i>

00:22.490 --> 00:24.156
<i> COULD BE ANYTHING--</i>
<i> A HOUSE NUMBER,</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:25.624
AN AREA CODE.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.526
WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT,
FOR BOTH OUR SAKES.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.295
<i> I WOULD LIKE TO COMPOSE</i>
<i> SOME MUSIC FOR THE PLAY.</i>

00:30.297 --> 00:31.797
SURE. THAT'D BE GREAT.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.465
<i> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW</i>
<i> THEY KNEW EACH OTHER.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.067
What is that?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.835
What did he just give her?

00:36.837 --> 00:39.471
<i> YOU KNOW YOU WANT</i>
<i> TO KISS ME.</i>

00:39.473 --> 00:40.639
( all gasp )

00:40.641 --> 00:42.141
<i> COME CLOSER.</i>
OH, MY GOD!

00:43.611 --> 00:45.144
IS THAT...
BLOOD?

00:45.146 --> 00:48.414
YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT IAN
USED TO KILL ALISON?

00:48.416 --> 00:50.582
WHICH ONE OF YOU
FOUND THE TROPHY?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.885
IT'S NOT HUMAN BLOOD.
WHY WOULD THERE--?

00:52.887 --> 00:55.754
LET'S SAVE OUR QUESTIONS
FOR THE PRECINCT.
FOLLOW ME.

00:57.691 --> 01:01.193
THE VIDEO WAS SENT TO US
BY AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.896
PROBABLY THE SAME PERSON
WHO SENT IT TO YOU.

01:03.898 --> 01:06.565
IT WAS LOADED
ONTO SPENCER'S LAPTOP.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.501
THIS TIME WE SAW
WHO ALISON WAS TALKING TO.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.637
IT WAS IAN.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.473
HE TOLD HER TO COME CLOSER...

01:14.475 --> 01:17.676
AND SHE DID.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.411
<i> IAN AND ALISON</i>
<i> WERE TOGETHER</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.180
THE WEEKEND BEFORE
SHE WENT MISSING.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.215
SPENCER CALLED HILTON HEAD.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.416
<i> IT WAS SPENCER...</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:26.051
WHO TALKED TO
THE DESK CLERK.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.719
IAN LIED TO SPENCER.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.255
HE STAYED AT HILTON HEAD
LAST SUMMER.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.257
THIS IS WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND--

01:32.259 --> 01:34.226
IAN WAS A STAR ATHLETE,
RIGHT?

01:34.228 --> 01:38.230
POPULAR GUY,
DATING A BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN LIKE YOUR SISTER.

01:38.232 --> 01:42.034
YOU REALLY THINK HE WOULD
RISK ALL THAT TO BE
WITH ALISON?

01:42.036 --> 01:44.436
SHE WAS BARELY 15.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.406
WELL, MAYBE HE HAS
A THING FOR YOUNGER GIRLS.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.878
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.314
I DON'T KNOW.

01:55.316 --> 01:59.084
WERE THERE OTHER
YOUNGER GIRLS HE WAS
INTERESTED IN?

01:59.086 --> 02:00.886
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.554
NO.
NO.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.089
NO ONE BUT ALISON.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.994
( telephone ringing )

02:10.764 --> 02:12.998
YOU'LL BE AVAILABLE
FOR MORE QUESTIONS?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.367
OF COURSE.
THE GIRLS HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.674
PAM JUST STEPPED OUT
TO CALL WAYNE.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.710
ARE THEY BEING CHARGED
WITH SOMETHING--

02:24.712 --> 02:26.345
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT
AN HONEST MISTAKE?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.681
SORRY.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.383
HAVEN'T THEY BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.718
THE GIRLS ARE FREE TO GO.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.219
I'M STILL TRYING
TO PROCESS THIS.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.888
IT APPEARS OUR DAUGHTERS

02:35.890 --> 02:38.557
HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS
OF A CRUEL JOKE.

02:40.961 --> 02:44.997
WHOEVER SAID "THE TRUTH
WILL SET YOU FREE"
NEVER MET "A."

02:44.999 --> 02:45.964
JESUS.

02:47.134 --> 02:50.135
IT'S FROM THE BIBLE.
JESUS SAID IT.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.503
THEN ARIA'S RIGHT,

02:51.505 --> 02:53.505
BECAUSE THAT BITCH
IS GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.074
I WASN'T COMPLETELY
HONEST IN THERE.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.445
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN,
BUT MY MOM WAS RIGHT
NEXT TO ME,

03:00.447 --> 03:01.980
AND WITH THE WHOLE
WREN THING,

03:01.982 --> 03:03.582
I COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO SAY

03:03.584 --> 03:05.017
THAT I ALSO HOOKED UP
WITH IAN.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.985
THAT HAS<i> NOTHING</i>
TO DO WITH THIS.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.921
I LIED ABOUT IT TOO,
SPENCE.

03:08.923 --> 03:12.357
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
TELLING THE TRUTH DOES
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.260
WHO SAID THAT?

03:15.262 --> 03:16.328
ALISON.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.798
HEY, EMILY.
GARRETT?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.001
YOU'RE A COP NOW?

03:23.003 --> 03:26.305
LOOK, UH, SORRY THEY'RE
PUTTING YOU THROUGH THIS.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.207
OFFICER REYNOLDS.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.013
PROBABLY WANTS
A REFILL ON HIS COFFEE
AND ANOTHER JELLY DONUT.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.552
HE LOOKS GOOD
IN A UNIFORM.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.790
SIR?
YOU KNOW THOSE GIRLS?

03:44.792 --> 03:47.092
MY PARENTS LIVED
DOWN THE STREET
FROM EMILY FIELDS,

03:47.094 --> 03:48.760
SO WE
USED TO BE NEIGHBORS.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.662
YOU THINK THEY'RE
TELLING THE TRUTH?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.599
UH... I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY WOULD LIE, SIR.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.901
NEITHER DO I.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.370
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
HELP ME FIND OUT.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.771
SIR?

03:59.773 --> 04:03.275
UNLESS YOU'D RATHER
BE WRITING PARKING TICKETS.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.384
The Pierces:<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

04:12.386 --> 04:14.987
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

04:14.989 --> 04:16.922
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

04:16.924 --> 04:19.958
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

04:19.960 --> 04:22.227
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

04:22.229 --> 04:25.430
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

04:25.432 --> 04:27.766
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

04:27.768 --> 04:29.868
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM</i>
<i> IS DEAD ¶</i>

04:36.443 --> 04:37.576
HEY.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.046
DID YOU GET SOME SLEEP?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.848
A LITTLE.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.685
YEAH, WE ALL NEEDED
A NIGHT TO SETTLE DOWN AND...

04:46.687 --> 04:49.321
RETHINK THIS.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.923
HAVE YOU...
TALKED TO MELISSA?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.558
YEAH.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.427
YEAH, WE TALKED
TO MELISSA AND IAN.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.796
THEY... WEREN'T
THAT SURPRISED.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.931
IN HINDSIGHT, YOUR
SISTER SAW IT COMING...

04:59.933 --> 05:02.334
AND WE SHOULD HAVE TOO.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.935
SAW WHAT COMING?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.038
WE SHOULD HAVE INSISTED
THAT YOU SEE SOMEONE

05:06.040 --> 05:08.774
AFTER THEY FOUND ALISON.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.642
WE'RE NOT BLAMING YOU,
WE'RE BLAMING OURSELVES.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.044
LIKE-- LIKE A SHRINK?

05:16.650 --> 05:17.783
DAD?

05:19.386 --> 05:22.854
LOOK, YOU--
YOU TOLD THE POLICE
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.190
SO WHILE THEY'RE
DOING THEIR JOB,

05:25.192 --> 05:28.493
WE JUST THINK YOU
SHOULD SEE A THERAPIST,

05:28.495 --> 05:29.628
TALK ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.566
I-I FEEL SCARED.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.202
OKAY?

05:37.204 --> 05:41.239
I FEEL SCARED EVERY DAY
THAT HE'S HERE.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.409
PLEASE, THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.218
I HOPE YOU GET
THE HELP YOU NEED.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.854
SPENCER, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M NOT ANGRY WITH YOU.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.024
I'M... CONFUSED,
BUT I'M NOT MAD.

05:59.026 --> 06:03.562
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
WHY YOU CAME BACK TO ROSEWOOD.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.330
YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.732
YOU'RE SICK.
MELISSA.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.266
THAT'S HOW I DEAL
WITH THIS, DAD.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.535
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
YOU'RE ILL.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.870
IF YOU HAD
JUST STAYED AWAY,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.338
NO ONE
EVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.706
Veronica: NOW,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.007
THE TROPHY WASN'T REAL,

06:16.009 --> 06:18.043
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT HE DIDN'T DO IT.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.345
OH, MY GOD,
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

06:20.347 --> 06:23.415
I'M JUST MAKING THINGS
WORSE BY BEING HERE.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.550
SPENCER, I MEANT
WHAT I SAID.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.892
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
LET ME BE HAPPY?

06:33.894 --> 06:36.962
THIS ISN'T ABOUT<i> YOU!</i>
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.498
LIKE ALWAYS,
IT'S ABOUT<i> YOU.</i>

06:44.972 --> 06:47.806
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
THIS MUST LOOK LIKE, AND...

06:47.808 --> 06:49.174
NO.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.510
HONEY,
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.987
I FORGOT MY BAG
HERE LAST NIGHT.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.991
HAVE YOU BEEN
SWIMMING AT NIGHTS

07:05.993 --> 07:08.126
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
I'M HERE IN THE MORNINGS?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.462
IT'S JUST KIND OF
WORKED OUT THAT WAY.

07:10.464 --> 07:15.434
AHEM. I LEFT YOU
A COUPLE OF MESSAGES.

07:15.436 --> 07:18.103
I WENT TO VISIT MY AUNT.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.038
SHE'S OLD AND SICK.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.309
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WERE AVOIDING ME.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.911
NO. I JUST...

07:27.247 --> 07:28.313
NO.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.118
OKAY, THIS IS
BEYOND AWKWARD.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.920
CAN WE PLEASE TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

07:34.922 --> 07:36.755
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.757
YOU KISSED ME,
REMEMBER?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.727
EMILY, JUST DROP IT.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.934
SO YOU WANT TO PRETEND
LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN?

07:48.936 --> 07:51.269
YES. PLEASE.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.343
CONSIDER IT FORGOTTEN.

08:11.925 --> 08:15.093
ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU WANT TO STAY HERE?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.529
I CAN'T HANDLE
ANOTHER FIGHT WITH JENNA,

08:17.531 --> 08:19.865
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
UNTIL MY PARENTS GET BACK,

08:19.867 --> 08:23.101
AND I DON'T THINK
YOUR PARENTS ARE GONNA
OFFER ME THE GUEST ROOM.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.871
IT'S MY FAULT SHE'S MAKING
YOUR LIFE SO MISERABLE.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.606
I DIDN'T HAVE
TO TAKE HER PHONE.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.140
HOW DOES SHE
KNOW IT WAS YOU?

08:29.142 --> 08:31.109
SHE DOESN'T.
BUT WITH JENNA,

08:31.111 --> 08:33.278
SUSPICION IS ENOUGH.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.114
I REALLY AM SORRY.
THAT'S OKAY.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.616
MY FOLKS'LL BE BACK
ON MONDAY,

08:37.618 --> 08:40.252
AND THEY'RE USUALLY
A DECENT BUFFER.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.487
YOU NEVER TALK
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.655
NEITHER DO YOU.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.758
YEAH, WELL...

08:46.760 --> 08:48.426
THE HOUSE OF HASTINGS
ISN'T EXACTLY

08:48.428 --> 08:51.062
MY SAFE PLACE TO LAND
RIGHT NOW, EITHER.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.564
SPENCER...

08:52.566 --> 08:56.368
IF JENNA HAS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOU BEING FRAMED,

08:56.370 --> 08:58.870
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO HELP YOU.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.972
THANK YOU.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.689
( flute playing )

09:24.164 --> 09:26.898
( flute continuing )

09:33.540 --> 09:35.840
( taps softly )

09:35.842 --> 09:37.742
( flute ceases )

09:43.951 --> 09:45.984
( silence )

10:01.635 --> 10:03.068
( coffee pouring )

10:03.070 --> 10:04.536
ENJOY YOUR SHOWER.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.171
I INTEND TO.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.122
MORNING.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.857
THANKS.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.559
OKAY, PEBBLES OR PUFFS?

10:27.561 --> 10:29.294
UH... SURPRISE ME.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.374
( chuckles softly )

10:43.644 --> 10:45.343
THAT TICKLES.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.578
REALLY?

10:46.580 --> 10:48.580
YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING.

10:48.582 --> 10:49.948
HANNA?

11:00.093 --> 11:03.294
MY ASS JUST FELL
INTO THE TOILET FOR
THE SECOND TIME THIS WEEK.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.597
YOU KNOW, I WAS
CLEANING YESTERDAY.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.732
I FORGOT TO PUT
THE SEAT BACK DOWN.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.934
UH-HUH.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.136
SORRY.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.705
EXPECTING COMPANY?

11:13.707 --> 11:14.973
NO.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.177
( chuckles )

11:19.179 --> 11:22.047
WAS HE HERE LAST NIGHT?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.482
UPSTAIRS,
IN THE NO-BOY ZONE?

11:24.484 --> 11:25.450
NOPE.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.252
DON'T LIE TO ME, HANNA.

11:28.689 --> 11:32.123
I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
OF HIM, AND HE DOES TOO.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.059
THAT'S WHY HE DOESN'T
HANG AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.595
OKAY, HE CAME OVER
A FEW TIMES,

11:37.597 --> 11:39.230
BUT IT WAS TO HELP ME
WITH MY HOMEWORK.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.766
RIGHT. I KNOW
BOYS LIKE CALEB.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.102
HE'S A TOUGH GUY,
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE
SAFE WITH HIM,

11:44.104 --> 11:45.603
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.439
CALEB IS LOOKING OUT
FOR CALEB.

11:47.441 --> 11:49.474
YOU MAY KNOW GUYS
LIKE CALEB,

11:49.476 --> 11:51.142
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.477
( sighs )

12:00.220 --> 12:01.586
THAT WAS CLOSE.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.756
IT WAS TOO CLOSE.
YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS TO GO.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.028
( sighs )

12:13.366 --> 12:16.067
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?
FORGOT SOMETHING.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.836
WHAT?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.319
( sighs )

12:50.170 --> 12:52.270
( no audible dialogue )

12:55.842 --> 12:57.909
( cell phone rings )

13:11.925 --> 13:13.525
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

13:13.527 --> 13:14.959
I-I CAN COME BACK LATER,
IF YOU'RE BUSY.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.261
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.431
THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR YOUR HELP, MR. FITZ.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.633
ABSOLUTELY, JENNA.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.335
HE'S ALL YOURS.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.577
JENNA IS
SUBMITTING A SHORT STORY
TO A COMPETITION.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.380
OH, I... THOUGHT
MUSIC WAS HER THING.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.382
I THINK SHE'S GOT
A SHOT AT WINNING.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.152
SO, UM, TONIGHT
I WAS THINKING

13:41.154 --> 13:43.621
THAT I WOULD COOK
INSTEAD OF TAKEOUT.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.690
SURE. I'VE GOT
A FACULTY THING AT FOUR,

13:45.692 --> 13:48.359
AND I PROMISED JENNA
ANOTHER ROUND OF NOTES.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.496
WHAT'S HER... STORY ABOUT?

13:51.498 --> 13:55.500
EXPOSING PEOPLE.
THE PROTAGONIST IS BLIND,

13:55.502 --> 13:59.571
BUT SHE "SEES"
MORE THAN SIGHTED PEOPLE.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.073
SO IT'S ABOUT HER?
SHE SAYS IT'S FICTION...

14:02.075 --> 14:04.075
BUT IT BEGINS ON THE NIGHT
OF AN ACCIDENT,

14:04.077 --> 14:06.244
AND HER BROTHER IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.183
WAS IT REALLY
TOBY'S FAULT?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.885
HE-- HE SET FIRE
TO THE GARAGE,

14:13.887 --> 14:16.621
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW
JENNA WAS INSIDE.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.824
HER STORY SUGGESTS THAT
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.559
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.963
HM.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.865
( sighs )

14:28.101 --> 14:29.701
( clears throat )

14:44.150 --> 14:47.018
( approaching conversation )

14:47.020 --> 14:49.020
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS HAPPENING.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.755
DO YOU WANT US TO TALK
TO THEM FOR YOU?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.590
NO.
WHO?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.692
SPENCER'S PARENTS
THINK SHE'S NUTS.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.261
UNSTABLE.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.495
AND WHY SHOULD THEY
BELIEVE ME?

14:57.497 --> 14:59.163
I MEAN, WE HAVE NO PROOF.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.598
I'M THE GIRL
WHO CRIED WOLF.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.634
AND THE WOLF IS LIVING
IN YOUR BACKYARD.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.136
RIGHT, WHICH IS WHY I NEED
TO GET INTO ROOM 214.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.704
SPENCER THINKS
JENNA HAS A ROOM

15:06.706 --> 15:08.139
AT THE EDGEWOOD MOTOR COURT.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.807
DID YOU SAY 214?

15:09.809 --> 15:13.278
AND I SAW THE BAG
THAT IAN GAVE HER.
IT'S IN THE ROOM.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.414
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE
A BREAK FROM PLAYING
<i> CHARLIE'S ANGELS.</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:19.651
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
ANOTHER NIGHT WITH
THE ROSEWOOD P.D.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.219
Spencer: HEY!

15:21.221 --> 15:23.021
AND THERE GOES LUCY LIU.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.257
GARRETT,
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

15:26.259 --> 15:28.726
SURE. WHAT'S UP?

15:28.728 --> 15:32.230
I KNOW THAT MOST OF
THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE
ON IAN IS WEAK.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.632
"WEAK"? IT'S NONEXISTENT.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.367
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW UP
ON HILTON HEAD.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.137
I KNOW THAT HE WAS THERE.
I SPOKE TO THE CLERK
MYSELF.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.139
I'M WAITING FOR A MANAGER
TO CALL ME BACK.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.808
IF IAN WAS THERE
WITH ALISON, I'LL FIND OUT.

15:43.810 --> 15:44.742
THANK YOU.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.713
HEY, SPENCER.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.582
YEAH?

15:53.019 --> 15:55.153
WHY WOULD IAN WANT ALI DEAD?

15:55.155 --> 15:57.889
BECAUSE SHE WAS
GOING TO TELL MELISSA
ABOUT THEIR AFFAIR.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.908
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE
SO FOND OF MR. FITZ.

16:16.910 --> 16:21.045
HE TAKES SUCH A PERSONAL
INTEREST IN HIS STUDENTS.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.548
I FEEL LIKE I CAN
TELL HIM ANYTHING.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.584
I WAS THINKING OF SUGGESTING
HE ADD ORWELL'S<i> 1984</i>

16:26.586 --> 16:28.886
TO THE READING LIST.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.722
YOU KNOW...

16:30.724 --> 16:32.890
BIG BROTHER'S
ALWAYS WATCHING YOU.

16:32.892 --> 16:36.060
MR. FITZ ISN'T SEDUCED
BY CONTROLLING CHARACTERS.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.931
YOU DO KNOW HIM BETTER.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.906
SCRABBLE.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.241
MAD LIBS.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.710
( gasps )
"BIKES TO DIE FOR,
BABES TO FIGHT FOR."

16:52.712 --> 16:54.679
PAGE 12.
IT'S A GREAT READ.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.014
( dubiously )
THANKS.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.182
AND I DOWNLOADED THIS APP
THAT TURNS MY PHONE

16:58.184 --> 16:59.584
INTO A LISTENING DEVICE.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.519
THAT WAY, IF ANYBODY
GOES NEXT DOOR,

17:01.521 --> 17:04.288
WE'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR
THEM THROUGH THE WALL.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.690
CAFFEINE?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.558
I THINK YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.726
( nearby door closes )

17:13.767 --> 17:16.801
HEY, DID YOU JUST
COME OUT OF ROOM 214?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.569
IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT WE CAN GET IN THERE?

17:18.571 --> 17:20.171
IS IT YOUR ROOM?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.607
NO, BUT WE--

17:22.609 --> 17:24.675
I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.
WAIT, UM...

17:24.677 --> 17:26.177
FOR A 20...

17:27.981 --> 17:30.214
CAN WE PRETEND
THAT HE SAID YES?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.755
SPENCER, JENNA'S GLASSES.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.858
THIS<i> IS</i> HER ROOM.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.460
THE BAG WAS ON THE BED.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.619
NOTHING.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.156
( door opens )

18:16.529 --> 18:19.097
SO... WHAT'S IT
GONNA BE FIRST?

18:19.099 --> 18:22.100
MAC AND CHEESE
OR FLUFF 'N' FOLD?

18:22.102 --> 18:24.302
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ HEART WAS BEATING ¶</i>

18:24.304 --> 18:26.671
<i> ¶ THUMP-THUMPS</i>
<i> BEATING FASTER ¶</i>

18:26.673 --> 18:29.407
<i> ¶ WHEN I SAW ¶</i>

18:29.409 --> 18:32.110
<i> ¶ YOUR FACE ¶</i>

18:34.247 --> 18:37.548
<i> ¶ OOH ¶</i>

18:37.550 --> 18:41.552
<i> ¶ OOOHHH ¶</i>

18:41.554 --> 18:43.221
MOM.
( Caleb clears throat )

18:43.223 --> 18:45.556
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WORKING LATE.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.092
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO SAY GOODBYE, CALEB.

18:48.094 --> 18:51.562
NO, HE JUST GOT HERE.
YOU MEAN HE JUST GOT BACK.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.598
I FOUND THIS IN THE BASEMENT.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.268
I SHOULD GO.
NO, DON'T LEAVE.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.937
EXCELLENT IDEA.
MOM, HE STAYED HERE
ONE NIGHT.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.974
REALLY? BECAUSE THE KITCHEN
CABINET FIXED ITSELF;

19:02.976 --> 19:04.976
A WEEK AGO, OUR GROCERY
BILL HAS TRIPLED;

19:04.978 --> 19:07.145
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T
CARB-LOAD FOR BREAKFAST.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.480
THIS ISN'T HER FAULT.
SAVE IT.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.681
JUST GO.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.918
DON'T COME BACK.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.830
( door opens, closes )

19:25.832 --> 19:27.999
HE HAD NOWHERE TO GO.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.567
THIS ISN'T A HALFWAY HOUSE.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.402
CAN'T HE JUST PLEASE
SPEND THE NIGHT?

19:31.404 --> 19:33.304
IT'S GETTING LATE,
AND IF HE DOESN'T STAY HERE,

19:33.306 --> 19:35.740
HE'LL WIND UP
SLEEPING ON A BENCH
AT THE BUS STATION.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.446
WE DON'T LIE
TO EACH OTHER, HANNA.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.725
( door slams )

20:06.406 --> 20:08.673
GPS:<i> YOU HAVE ARRIVED</i>
<i> AT YOUR DESTINATION.</i>

20:10.810 --> 20:15.479
<i> ( rock music playing )</i>

20:15.481 --> 20:17.882
Woman on PA:<i> HEY,</i>
<i> DON'T FORGET TO SIGN UP</i>

20:17.884 --> 20:20.251
<i> FOR YOUR TURN</i>
<i> AT KARAOKE TONIGHT.</i>

20:23.823 --> 20:27.024
( sighs softly )
DO YOU COME HERE A LOT?

20:27.026 --> 20:30.461
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS SO...

20:30.463 --> 20:31.829
RUSTIC?

20:33.199 --> 20:34.932
I FOUND IT ONLINE.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.500
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE...

20:36.502 --> 20:38.035
REMOTE.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.371
YOU GONNA FINISH
ALL MY SENTENCES?

20:40.373 --> 20:41.906
SORRY.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.641
THAT WAS A JOKE.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.877
I THINK...
I WAS...

20:46.879 --> 20:49.247
YOU GO FIRST.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.715
YOU WERE RIGHT TODAY.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.319
I WAS AVOIDING YOU.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.656
I SCARED MYSELF
THAT NIGHT WHEN I...
KISSED ME?

20:58.658 --> 21:00.591
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.864
THE FIRST TIME
I SAW YOU WITH MAYA,

21:06.866 --> 21:09.500
WHEN I REALIZED
YOU WERE TOGETHER...

21:09.502 --> 21:13.004
I FINALLY
ADMITTED TO MYSELF
THAT I WAS LIKE YOU.

21:13.006 --> 21:15.539
AM I THE FIRST GIRL
YOU'VE KISSED?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.110
ROMANTIC, HUH?

21:19.112 --> 21:22.013
DEFINITELY
YOU SURPRISED ME.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.348
SO, WAS MAYA
YOUR FIRST GIRLFRIEND?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.617
SHE WAS.

21:28.354 --> 21:31.255
BUT SHE... WASN'T THE FIRST
GIRL I'VE EVER KISSED.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.861
I WAS IN LOVE WITH ALISON.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.597
WAS SHE IN LOVE WITH YOU?

21:39.599 --> 21:40.698
NO.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.770
I DIDN'T KNOW HER WELL,
BUT...

21:45.772 --> 21:48.906
SHE SEEMED LIKE
A VERY DYNAMIC PERSON.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.474
SHE WAS THAT.

21:51.744 --> 21:55.346
MAYA WAS KIND OF
LIKE THAT TOO, RIGHT?

21:55.348 --> 21:59.850
YEAH, I...
GUESS I LIKE...

21:59.852 --> 22:01.519
BALLSY WOMEN.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.921
( both laugh )

22:07.493 --> 22:09.794
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ I LOVE THE WAY YOU TALK ¶</i>

22:09.796 --> 22:13.631
<i> ¶ I LOVE THE WAY YOU SMILE,</i>

22:13.633 --> 22:15.933
<i> ¶ I LOVE THE WAY... ¶</i>

22:15.935 --> 22:18.536
WELCOME HOME, HONEY.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.004
WOW.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.574
HI.

22:27.613 --> 22:30.414
ARE WE CELEBRATING
SOMETHING I'M NOT AWARE OF?

22:30.416 --> 22:31.515
NO.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.051
YOU'RE WEARING THIS DRESS
BECAUSE...?

22:34.053 --> 22:37.955
BECAUSE I JUST...
WANTED TO HEAR YOU SAY WOW.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.491
( chuckles )
I LIKE COMING HOME TO YOU.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.727
( chuckles )

22:42.729 --> 22:43.861
( sighs )

22:43.863 --> 22:45.096
SORRY I'M LATE.

22:45.098 --> 22:48.199
THINGS WITH JENNA TOOK
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.835
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT HER STORY.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.903
CHEESE BALL?
SURE.

22:52.905 --> 22:56.140
HER STORY IS SO RAW,
WHICH IS SURPRISING,

22:56.142 --> 22:58.275
COMING FROM SOMEBODY
SO GUARDED.

22:58.277 --> 23:00.211
WAS SHE ALWAYS LIKE THAT?

23:01.914 --> 23:03.948
WE WERE NEVER THAT CLOSE.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.217
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
HER LIFE MUST BE LIKE.

23:06.219 --> 23:09.754
HOW DOES A FAMILY JUST
GET OVER SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

23:09.756 --> 23:11.288
( curtly )
THEY DON'T.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.393
CAN WE JUST TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.228
Yeah.
DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.538
( distant owl hooting )

23:27.540 --> 23:29.540
YOU SURE I CAN'T
HELP YOU WITH THAT?

23:29.542 --> 23:31.475
IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER
IF I DO IT MYSELF.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.079
( unusual howling )

23:36.816 --> 23:38.716
OWLS DO THAT
WHEN THEY DIVE FOR PREY.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.888
( nearby leaves rustling )

23:43.890 --> 23:47.792
OKAY, I THINK I'D
FEEL SAFER ON A BENCH
AT THE BUS STATION.

23:47.794 --> 23:51.929
I TOLD YOU I'D SPRING
FOR A HOTEL.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.397
AND I SAID NO, THANK YOU.

23:56.302 --> 23:59.503
ALL RIGHT, JUNGLE JANE,
WHAT GIVES?

23:59.505 --> 24:00.638
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.174
YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF HEELS
AND HANDBAGS,

24:03.176 --> 24:05.176
BUT OUT HERE
YOU'RE DORA THE EXPLORER.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.844
( chuckles softly )

24:06.846 --> 24:08.746
YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
PERSONALITIES I SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT?

24:13.019 --> 24:15.719
I SPENT FIVE SUMMERS
AT FAT CAMP.

24:17.356 --> 24:18.322
YOU?

24:20.293 --> 24:22.526
MY NICKNAME
WAS "HEFTY HANNA."

24:24.630 --> 24:26.697
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO TELL ME THAT.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.769
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
WHO I AM.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.377
I NEVER MET MY FATHER.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.952
WHEN I WAS 5,

24:47.954 --> 24:50.221
MY MOM DROPPED ME OFF
AT MY AUNT'S HOUSE
TO GO SHOPPING.

24:54.527 --> 24:55.893
SHE NEVER CAME BACK.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.565
WHEN I WAS 10,
SHE SENT ME
A BIRTHDAY CARD.

25:04.604 --> 25:07.738
IT SAID,
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
LOVE, MOM."

25:11.444 --> 25:12.409
THAT'S IT.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.915
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PISSED, RIGHT?

25:20.119 --> 25:22.853
I WAS SO HAPPY
TO GET THAT CARD.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.125
IT WAS POSTMARKED
FROM ARIZONA.

25:31.264 --> 25:33.764
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE
I KNOW SHE WAS.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.099
( clears throat softly )

25:54.186 --> 25:58.722

26:20.179 --> 26:22.179
NO. NO WAY.

( applause continues )

26:24.183 --> 26:25.783
<i> THEY LOVE YOU ALREADY.</i>

26:25.785 --> 26:28.586
I DON'T DO KARAOKE.

26:28.588 --> 26:29.720
<i> COME ON, EMILY.</i>

26:29.722 --> 26:32.790
<i> TAKE A WALK</i>
<i> ON THE WILD SIDE.</i>

26:32.792 --> 26:34.191
( cheers and applause )

26:42.401 --> 26:45.736
I AM SO GONNA GET YOU
BACK FOR THIS.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.371
<i> ¶ NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH ¶</i>

26:47.373 --> 26:49.039
<i> ¶ HE'S GONNA START A FIGHT ¶</i>

<i> ¶ NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH ¶</i>

26:50.710 --> 26:52.409
<i> ¶ WE'RE ALL GONNA</i>

26:53.713 --> 26:56.213
<i> ¶ I'M STILL A ROCK STAR ¶</i>

26:56.215 --> 26:58.248
<i> ¶ I'VE GOT MY ROCK MOVES ¶</i>

26:58.250 --> 27:00.217
<i> ¶ AND I DON'T NEED YOU ¶</i>

27:00.219 --> 27:02.186
<i> ¶ AND GUESS WHAT? ¶</i>

27:02.188 --> 27:03.787
<i> ¶ I'M HAVING MORE FUN ¶</i>

27:03.789 --> 27:05.656
<i> ¶ AND NOW</i>
<i> THAT WE'RE DONE... ¶</i>

27:05.658 --> 27:08.726
JENNA MIGHT NOT EVEN
BE HERE TILL MORNING.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.830
( sighs )

27:20.673 --> 27:22.006
( sighs )

27:23.142 --> 27:25.275
"GLYCERALDEHYDE"?

27:25.277 --> 27:28.746
WITH THE "C"
ON THE DOUBLE LETTER,

27:28.748 --> 27:30.547
IT IS 32 POINTS,

27:30.549 --> 27:33.917
PLUS THE TRIPLE WORD SCORE
GETS ME 96 POINTS.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.155
"GOOFBALL."

27:38.157 --> 27:42.593
YOU CAN PUT DOWN
104 POINTS FOR ME.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.329
THANKS FOR THE "G."
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.898

27:49.869 --> 27:52.870

BINGO BONUS.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.640
WELL. 104 POINTS.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.008
GOOD FOR YOU.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.543
I LIKE THIS GAME.

28:00.946 --> 28:02.680
( scoffs softly )

28:02.682 --> 28:05.382
I HOPE YOU DON'T
TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

28:05.384 --> 28:08.352
BUT... YOU CAN'T BE
COMFORTABLE

28:08.354 --> 28:10.954
IN THAT JACKET
AND THAT TIE.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.193
I'M FINE.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.700

30:44.410 --> 30:45.742
ANYBODY INTERESTING?

30:45.744 --> 30:48.512
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.514
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.649
( cell phone rings )

30:55.187 --> 30:59.189
I THOUGHT YOUR SATURDAYS
WERE SAVED FOR COFFEE
AND CARTOONS WITH FITZ.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.858
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING HIM?

31:00.860 --> 31:02.993
I'M NOT EXACTLY AVOIDING HIM.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.829
HE'S CALLED YOU THREE TIMES
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.798
OKAY, I'M AVOIDING HIM.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.804
HE'S... HELPING JENNA
WITH THIS THING,

31:13.806 --> 31:15.706
AND HE KEEPS ASKING
QUESTIONS ABOUT HER.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.074
"WAS IT REALLY TOBY'S FAULT?

31:17.076 --> 31:19.476
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW HARD
HER LIFE MUST BE?"

31:19.478 --> 31:21.545
I MEAN... OH, MY GOD!

31:21.547 --> 31:23.313
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

31:23.315 --> 31:26.049
I LIE.
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.919
DO YOU<i> WANT</i>
TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

31:28.921 --> 31:31.655
DOESN'T MATTER.
WE MADE A PROMISE.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.390
SO YOU WANT TO?

31:33.392 --> 31:35.726
I FEEL LIKE I<i> NEED</i> TO.

31:35.728 --> 31:38.095
THEN YOU DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

31:38.097 --> 31:42.165
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT SPENCER OR HANNA,

31:42.167 --> 31:46.036
BUT... IF<i> YOU</i> TRUST HIM,
I DO TOO.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.677
Hey.

32:26.679 --> 32:29.513
HAVE YOU BEEN UP ALL NIGHT?

32:29.515 --> 32:31.648
MNH-MNH.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.518
WHAT?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.559
WHO IS "A"?

33:15.561 --> 33:17.461
I-I HAVE NO IDEA.

33:20.032 --> 33:23.400
<i> ( rock music playing )</i>
I LOVE THIS BAND.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.102
ME TOO.

33:25.104 --> 33:28.505
THEY'RE PLAYING
IN THE CITY NEXT MONTH.
WE SHOULD GO AND SEE 'EM.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.308
I'D LIKE TO, BUT, YOU KNOW...

33:31.310 --> 33:32.409
WHAT?

33:33.946 --> 33:36.780
WE MIGHT SEE PEOPLE
WE<i> KNOW</i> THERE.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.849
I CAN'T RISK
BEING SEEN WITH YOU.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.992
I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD.

33:48.994 --> 33:51.928
I SO UNDERSTAND.
BELIEVE ME, I DO.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.067
BUT HEARING YOU SAY THAT...

33:57.069 --> 33:58.368
OUCH.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.537
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.474
I HAD AN AMAZING TIME
LAST NIGHT.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.713
AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO KEEP SEEING YOU.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.015
LIKE THIS?

34:12.017 --> 34:15.152
ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE, HIDING?

34:15.154 --> 34:17.220
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN DO IT.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.459
I'M NOT ASHAMED
OF WHO I AM...

34:22.461 --> 34:24.728
BUT I USED TO BE,

34:24.730 --> 34:26.963
AND IF WE HAVE TO HIDE
LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME,

34:26.965 --> 34:29.733
I'M GONNA START TO FEEL
THAT WAY AGAIN.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.202
I REALLY LIKE YOU, EMILY.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.603
I LIKE YOU TOO.

34:33.605 --> 34:37.340
AND I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE
FOR YOU.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.643
BUT I THINK IT HAS
TO BE AS FRIENDS.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.946
I'M SORRY.

34:51.056 --> 34:53.023
HEY.

34:53.025 --> 34:55.258
I'VE BEEN LEAVING YOU
MESSAGES ALL MORNING.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.793
I KNOW.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.162
I'VE BEEN AVOIDING YOU.

34:59.164 --> 35:00.597
WHY?

35:07.473 --> 35:10.040
WHAT'S GOING ON, ARIA?

35:10.042 --> 35:12.309
YOU'RE STARTING
TO SCARE ME.

35:12.311 --> 35:17.180
I'VE BEEN WALKING
AROUND YOUR BLOCK
THE PAST TWO HOURS,

35:17.182 --> 35:20.750
TRYING TO TALK MYSELF
OUT OF WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO TELL YOU,

35:20.752 --> 35:25.622
BECAUSE
I KNOW IF I DO...

35:25.624 --> 35:29.025
THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT YOU'LL NEVER LOOK
AT ME THE SAME AGAIN.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.795
ARIA.

35:35.801 --> 35:39.269
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
HEARD ANYTHING?

35:39.271 --> 35:41.738
PLEASE LET ME KNOW
THE SECOND THAT YOU DO.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.447
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WITH CALEB.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.548
SLEEPING ON A BUS BENCH?

35:51.550 --> 35:52.816
WE CAMPED OUT.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.351
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

35:54.353 --> 35:57.621
I HAVE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
LOOKING FOR YOU,

35:57.623 --> 36:00.123
SCARED TO DEATH OF WHAT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU--

36:00.125 --> 36:02.292
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

36:02.294 --> 36:05.128
I'M GOING TO SHOWER,
AND THEN I'M CHANGING,
AND THEN I'M GOING BACK.

36:05.130 --> 36:07.130
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET YOU!

36:07.132 --> 36:09.966
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND
HIS SITUATION.

36:09.968 --> 36:13.737
YOU WERE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GET OUT OF YOURS.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.972
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

36:23.682 --> 36:25.815

<i> HANNA?</i>

36:47.739 --> 36:49.773
NO. THIS IS HER MOTHER.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.849
IF IT GETS
TOO UNCOMFORTABLE AT HOME,

36:59.851 --> 37:01.851
I'M HERE FOR ONE MORE NIGHT.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.386
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.555
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.926
I'M SORRY THIS WAS A BUST.

37:09.928 --> 37:13.363
IT WASN'T...
A COMPLETE WASH.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.198
TO BE HONEST...

37:15.200 --> 37:17.901
IT WAS REALLY FUN
TO KICK YOUR ASS
AT SCRABBLE.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.691
I WAS...
NOT EXPECTING THAT.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.628
ME NEITHER.

37:58.577 --> 38:01.778
HEY, IT WAS NOT
A COMPLETE ASS-KICKING,
BY THE WAY.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.246
GOODBYE, SPENCER.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.929
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
COME TO DINNER.

38:22.401 --> 38:25.669
DID IT FOR HANNA,
NOT YOU.

38:25.671 --> 38:26.770
I KNOW.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.607
UH, IS IT OKAY
IF I GRAB A SODA?

38:30.609 --> 38:31.908
HELP YOURSELF.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.645
YOU HAVE BEEN
FOR WEEKS, RIGHT?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.987
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

38:45.324 --> 38:48.491
FOR A SHORT TIME,
IN THE GUEST ROOM.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.428
BUT IF YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT HURTING MY DAUGHTER,

38:51.430 --> 38:57.033
I WILL MAKE SURE
YOU REGRET IT.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.735
I BELIEVE YOU.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.340
THANK YOU.

39:13.418 --> 39:17.187
I TRY NOT TO LOOK BACK,
BUT...

39:17.189 --> 39:20.724
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I COULD CHANGE
IN MY LIFE,

39:20.726 --> 39:22.158
IT WOULD BE THAT NIGHT.

39:25.864 --> 39:26.696
HEY.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.168
I LOVE YOU.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.904
AND NOTHING YOU JUST SAID
TO ME CHANGES THAT.

39:39.311 --> 39:41.177
THANK YOU
FOR LOOKING AT ME TONIGHT

39:41.179 --> 39:43.480
THE SAME WAY
YOU DID YESTERDAY.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.029
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.231
SLEEP TIGHT.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.013
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. MARIN.

40:19.384 --> 40:20.517
YOU CAN CALL ME ASHLEY.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.300
( cell phone keys beeping )

40:47.979 --> 40:51.147
I can't do this anymore.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.982
It's over.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.884
I'm out.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.186
( beep )

40:58.223 --> 41:02.158
WHY IS THERE A POLICE CAR
IN THE DRIVEWAY?

41:02.160 --> 41:04.727
DID THEY TALK TO IAN?

41:04.729 --> 41:07.597
DID THEY FIND OUT THAT HE WAS
AT HILTON HEAD WITH ALI?

41:07.599 --> 41:09.232
NO.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.401
BECAUSE HE WASN'T
WITH ALISON, HE WAS WITH ME.

41:17.209 --> 41:18.908
HE LIED TO PROTECT ME.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.911
I WAS PREGNANT
THAT SUMMER, AND...

41:21.913 --> 41:24.814
WE WENT THERE
TO GET AN ABORTION.

41:29.020 --> 41:32.322
I LOST THE BABY
BEFORE WE WENT
TO THE DOCTOR.

41:32.324 --> 41:36.092
THAT'S WHY THIS BABY
IS<i> SO</i> IMPORTANT TO ME.

COMPLETELY HONEST WITH US.
