01:27.621 --> 01:30.323
Well, this is the biggest joke
in the world.

01:30.356 --> 01:31.592
What is?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.359
Wainwright has got
some psychiatrist

01:33.393 --> 01:35.395
doing a stress evaluation
with the printers.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.865
[laughing]

01:41.935 --> 01:44.337
That is the biggest joke
in the world.

01:44.370 --> 01:47.240
I‐I, I, I love it. I’m just not
quite clear on the punchline.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.578
What I’m trying to tell you
is that Wainwright

01:51.612 --> 01:52.913
volunteered to help some doctor

01:52.946 --> 01:55.315
who’s doing a stress test
with the printers.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.283
The printers aren’t
under any stress at all!

[laughing]

02:02.689 --> 02:04.591
Appleton, Bartokomous

02:04.625 --> 02:07.460
I’m gonna need your Dimitri
cartoon one day early this week.

02:07.493 --> 02:08.829
We’re trying a new format
on the Sunday paper.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.531
Well, you can count on us, sir.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.566
And may I compliment you
on your selection

02:12.599 --> 02:14.434
of the printers
for the stress evaluation?

02:14.467 --> 02:15.769
They’re under a lot of pressure
down there.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.738
[laughing]

02:20.473 --> 02:21.642
Of course, it doesn’t
come anywhere near

02:21.675 --> 02:24.410
the level of stress we have
up here in the nerve center.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.179
[laughing]

02:27.881 --> 02:28.882
He’s killing me.

02:32.619 --> 02:33.920
Well, I guess
we’ve become somewhat, uh

02:33.954 --> 02:36.289
experts at, uh, managing stress.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.358
Appleton, you’ve given me
an excellent idea.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.526
Well, just part of my job, sir.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.897
And, uh, what idea
would that be, sir?

02:43.930 --> 02:45.532
The idea is to forget
the printers.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.767
I’m gonna send
the doctor up here

02:46.800 --> 02:48.835
to the nerve center
to talk with the experts.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.575
‐What have I done?
‐I have no idea.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.677
But you were on a roll, buddy.

02:57.978 --> 02:58.979
I think, I just got everybody

02:59.012 --> 03:02.415
in the City Room
volunteered for a stress test.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.450
‐That could be fun.
‐No, it’s not gonna be fun.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.286
Balki, there’s gonna be
some psychiatrist up here

03:06.319 --> 03:08.421
trying to find out
everything we’re thinking.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.891
Well, uh, that might be
possible with you, cousin

03:10.924 --> 03:13.493
but I don’t think
he can do that to me.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.930
Most of the time,
I don’t know what I’m thinking.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.900
I mean, sometimes I think
I know what I’m thinking

03:19.933 --> 03:24.638
and then I start to try to think
about what I’m thinking

03:24.671 --> 03:27.373
and just when I think
the thought that I think

03:27.407 --> 03:30.310
I’m thinking...
the thought is gone.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.314
What are we talking about?

03:36.282 --> 03:37.183
We, uh, a, wait.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.320
We’re talking
about the psychiatrist.

03:40.353 --> 03:41.655
‐The psychiatrist‐‐
‐Oh, the psychiatrist.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.924
Do you see the way
your mind wanders?

03:45.992 --> 03:47.327
No, hey, no, Balki.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.428
Balki, no, see, see

03:48.461 --> 03:50.330
that is just what is going
to get you into trouble.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.898
You have to be very careful

03:51.932 --> 03:54.000
what you say
to the psychiatrist, okay?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.168
Because he’s gonna take
everything you say

03:55.201 --> 03:58.705
and, and twist it and,
and turn it and, and think that

03:58.739 --> 04:00.507
just because your,
your brother Billy

04:00.541 --> 04:02.308
was your dad’s favorite
that you’re bitter and neurotic.

04:02.342 --> 04:03.476
Well, it’s not true, I tell you.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.379
And, and I just never had
the chance to show dad that I...

04:06.412 --> 04:09.616
Cousin, cousin, listen, cousin.
Cousin, it’s okay.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.384
It’s alright. It’s alright.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.054
It’s alright, now, now,
just don’t‐don’t worry about

04:14.087 --> 04:16.623
your brother Billy
and don’t worry about me

04:16.656 --> 04:18.324
because when the psychiatrist
comes to talk to me

04:18.358 --> 04:19.692
I’m just gonna be myself.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.894
‐You’re just gonna be myself.
‐You’re just gonna be yourself?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.028
I’m just gonna be myself.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.764
Let me tell you
something, Balki.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.932
You have gotta tell these people
exactly what they want to hear.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.701
Whatever you do,
do not speak Myposian.

04:27.734 --> 04:28.869
‐Why not?
‐No, not a word.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.505
‐It’s a noble language.
‐No, not a word of Myposian.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.840
No, no, none of this oh!
Po, po, po, po, po, po.

Oh! Oh! That right, Dr. Aldrich.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.430

Oh, no. No, no, not a chant.

Hello, hello,
I’m Balki Bartokomous and...

05:01.467 --> 05:03.069
And this my‐my cousin,
Larry Appleton.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.304
And, uh...

05:05.706 --> 05:07.641
I wouldn’t bring up
his brother, Billy.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.546
I’m just gonna ask
a few questions

05:12.579 --> 05:14.681
do some word association,
show you some ink blots

05:14.715 --> 05:16.416
and ask for your
interpretations.

05:16.449 --> 05:17.984
[instrumental music]

05:18.852 --> 05:20.320
Alright, Larry.

05:21.888 --> 05:22.956
What do you see?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.660
Man’s, uh, relentless quest

05:26.693 --> 05:30.396
to return to and liberate
the child within, as I have.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.499

05:35.168 --> 05:37.704
And what do you see in this one?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.940
Man in turmoil,
uh, struggling to reach

05:39.973 --> 05:42.909
the level of inner peace I have.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.812
Bowling ball.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.451
Now, we’re going to do
some word association.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.986
I’ll say a word,
you say the first thing

05:53.019 --> 05:54.621
that comes in your head.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.089
Boy.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.759
Young, well‐adjusted
urban warrior with a vision

05:58.792 --> 06:00.994
desire to help others
on his road toward adulthood.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.030
Girl.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.467
‐Career.
‐Struggling, clutching.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.535
Climbing, always trying to reach
the next rung

06:08.569 --> 06:09.836
of the corporate ladder

06:09.870 --> 06:12.005
all while being a loyal soldier
to Mr. Wainwright, which I am.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.175
Job.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.745
Now, there’s just one more area
that I’d like to cover.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.047
I understand
that even though you’re married

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
your cousin
still lives with you.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.918
Tell me about that.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.787
Oh, I do, uh, well,
no, no, that’s...

06:26.820 --> 06:28.922
I know that it may seem
a little peculiar but, uh...

06:28.955 --> 06:30.991
No, uh, well, uh...
I had no choice.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.694
Because, well‐well,
to be‐be perfectly honest

06:33.727 --> 06:36.062
uh, he’s,
he’s helpless without me.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.667
Cousin Larry said that
he needed help with the rent

06:40.701 --> 06:43.904
but to tell you the truth
he’s...helpless without me.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.842
[instrumental music]

06:54.581 --> 06:56.082
Bartokomous, Appleton.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.653
‐Hi, Mr. Wainwright.
‐Yes, sir, Mr. Wainwright.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.722
I just finished talking
with Dr. Aldrich.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.925
And he’s given me some
very constructive ideas

07:04.958 --> 07:06.727
about changes
I could make around here.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.863
Well, you know, I was pretty
impressed with him myself.

07:09.896 --> 07:14.467
Dr. Aldrich, uh, found you two
very, um, interesting.

07:14.501 --> 07:18.171
Uh, in fact, he’s so impressed
by you that he wants both of you

07:18.204 --> 07:20.140
to do further stress testing
at his clinic.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.742
Be there tomorrow morning
at nine.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.211
Cousin, did you hear that?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.914
We get to go down to the clinic
for further testing!

07:27.948 --> 07:30.617
Oh, I’m so excited!

07:30.651 --> 07:32.819
I don’t know about you but I’m
not gonna sleep a wink tonight.

07:32.853 --> 07:36.056
What am I gonna wear?
What am I gonna wear?

07:36.089 --> 07:37.591
Oh, I guess, we shouldn’t flaunt

07:37.624 --> 07:39.693
our good fortune
in front of the others.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.764
I knew it. I knew it.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.898
Dr. Aldrich found something

07:44.931 --> 07:47.601
to make him think
that we’re unstable, the quack.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.770
What did you tell him?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.872
Did you tell him
about the Dance of Joy?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.675
Tell him about it?
I taught it to him.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.677
He did this snappy little
knee‐jerk thing

07:56.710 --> 07:57.878
with a little rotation up here.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.045
I’m gonna have you try it.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.815
Balki, Balki. Don’t you see
what’s going on here?

08:01.848 --> 08:03.817
When Wainwright said he’s,
he’s gonna make some changes

08:03.850 --> 08:05.786
around here,
what‐what he means is that

08:05.819 --> 08:08.522
he’s gonna find out who can’t
handle stress and fire them.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.624
And I’m gonna be
one of the first ones to go.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.192
[instrumental music]

08:18.264 --> 08:20.834
[instrumental music]

08:34.047 --> 08:36.616
So, this is the clinic.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.318
It’s even more wonderful
than I dreamed.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.087
So much formica
and simulated wood.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.030
Well, I‐I, I don’t
have to work at the paper.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.534
I could cut hair.

08:55.001 --> 08:58.138
My Uncle Bud had a barbershop,
did‐did well.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.273
And my Uncle Ed
sold meat door‐to‐door

09:00.306 --> 09:01.975
always made a very nice living.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.577
Cousin.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.012
Cousin, listen.
This is not necessary.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.649
You’re not going to
lose your job.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.218
And can we please
just be adults about this?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.589
Popsicle sticks!

09:21.728 --> 09:24.097
No, no, Balki,
those are not popsicle sticks.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.632
Those are tongue depressors.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.201
Well, of course they are,
don’t be ridiculous.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.171
After the popsicle’s gone...

09:31.204 --> 09:32.973
...your tongue gets depressed.

09:38.712 --> 09:39.846
Hello, Larry, Balki.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.114
Dr. Mike!

09:42.716 --> 09:43.917
[both chuckle]

09:43.950 --> 09:45.285
Well, are you ready
to get started?

09:45.318 --> 09:46.887
Dr. Mike, before we get started

09:46.920 --> 09:49.623
I just got to hear
your duck imitation.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.891
‐My duck imitation?
‐Yeah.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.659
Cousin Larry says
you’re a big quack.

09:57.864 --> 10:01.735
‐Will you stop it?
‐Ow! Ow!

10:01.768 --> 10:04.304
He’s, he’s a little
nervous about the test.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.307
Oh!

10:07.340 --> 10:09.943
Look, cousin, chest watches.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.379
What these devices will do is

10:13.413 --> 10:16.082
measure the amount of stress
that your body is feeling.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.751
Please, be seated.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.386
We’re just gonna ask you
to perform a few simple tasks.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.022
There’s no right or wrong way
to do them.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.189
No passing or failing.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.991
Just do your best.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.229
[door closes]

10:29.262 --> 10:30.664
No passing or failing.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.233
We’re going to be graded
on everything we do.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.002
Oh, come on, cousin,
Dr. Mike left the room.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.271
We can do anything we want
in this palace of fun.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.372
I’m so excited.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.976
Balki, we cannot do
anything we want.

10:43.009 --> 10:47.080
Dr. Mike is gonna be watching us
from behind the mirror.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.849
Get out of the city.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.986
There’s no room
behind that mirror.

10:53.019 --> 10:56.156
It’s just right up
against the wall.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.292
No, Balky, there is another room
on the other side of the mirror.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.162
He can see us,
but we can’t see him.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.864

21:09.970 --> 21:13.473
We still got our jobs
and we’re bringing big laughs

21:13.507 --> 21:15.408
to Mr. and Mrs. Wainwright’s
parties

21:15.441 --> 21:18.945
and, uh...we learned
a valuable lesson.

21:18.979 --> 21:21.915
That we make a great team...
till we start to fight.

21:21.948 --> 21:25.986
So, uh, let’s just
see to it that, uh...

21:26.019 --> 21:28.989
...we don’t have
any more fights, okay?

21:29.022 --> 21:31.892
W‐w‐w‐wait a minute,
wait a minute.

21:31.925 --> 21:35.562
Are‐are you saying that I am
the one who starts the fights?

21:35.596 --> 21:37.063
[scoffs]

21:37.097 --> 21:40.033
Well, I’m not saying that no

21:40.066 --> 21:42.536
although you are the one that

21:42.569 --> 21:44.771
that has always started them.

21:44.805 --> 21:47.440
I mean, for six years anyway,
you have been the one who starts

21:47.473 --> 21:49.776
but, look, but that is
water under the fridge

21:49.810 --> 21:51.444
you just, it’s not,
the important thing.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.079
What do you mean?
What do you mean for six years?

21:53.113 --> 21:55.481
I’ve been the one
who has started the fights?

21:55.516 --> 21:57.518
Well, you’re the one that
comes two inches from my ear

21:57.551 --> 21:59.485
and says "What,
are you outta your mind?"

22:01.555 --> 22:03.924
Alright, well, well,
I am not the one

22:03.957 --> 22:07.393
with the attention span
of a flea.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.963
Well, I am not the one
that comes up behind you

22:09.996 --> 22:12.966
and does this
when you want me to shut up.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.801
Oh, well, I am not the one
who’s always saying

22:14.835 --> 22:16.503
"Oh, go on with you."

22:18.004 --> 22:19.405
Yeah, but you do this.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.674
Aw!

22:20.707 --> 22:21.808
No. You do this!

22:21.842 --> 22:22.976
Ow!

22:23.009 --> 22:24.110
Actually, I guess...

22:24.144 --> 22:25.512
(both)
We both do this.

22:25.546 --> 22:26.713
(both)
Aw!

22:26.747 --> 22:28.481
[instrumental music]

22:34.521 --> 22:36.857
[theme music]
