And if it was up to
the bureaucrats,

11:31.858 --> 11:34.653
we'd be sleeping in high school
gyms until Labor Day.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.321
- [crowd murmuring]
- [scoffs]

11:36.405 --> 11:39.282
- [sighs] Thanks.
- Thank you.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.786
Mommy, does this mean
we can go home now?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.539
It's about time someone
cut through all the red tape

11:45.622 --> 11:48.917
and did something, instead
of just talking about it.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.585
You know how long
I've been begging the city

11:50.669 --> 11:52.045
to clean up that mess?

11:52.129 --> 11:54.714
Six years. [chuckles]

11:54.798 --> 11:56.967
[sighs] Oh, but unless
you know somebody?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.468
[scoffs] Good luck.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.638
You know me, don't you?

12:06.101 --> 12:07.269
[grunts]

12:23.368 --> 12:24.536
[crowd exclaiming]

12:29.875 --> 12:31.793
[woman laughs]

12:31.877 --> 12:35.755
- Wow.
- That is so cool!

12:39.134 --> 12:41.428
[phone rings]

12:43.346 --> 12:44.139
Hey, Mom.

12:44.222 --> 12:47.392
No, no, everything's fine.
Great, actually.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.187
I was just thinking
about you, and... Wait.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.272
Is something wrong?

12:52.355 --> 12:53.523
[Mark yawns]

12:53.607 --> 12:56.401
- Hey, Mom.
- Morning.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.113
Since when do you drink coffee?

13:00.197 --> 13:01.990
[yawning] Since I got my powers.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.786
Oh. I hadn't noticed.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.622
Mm.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.834
[scoffs] It keeps doing that.

13:12.918 --> 13:16.838
I told Cecil those contractors
he hired were total amateurs.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.798
Yeah, well, at least
he fixed our house.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.383
His people shot it up.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.720
Can we please
not do this right now?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.639
Sorry.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.683
I guess we're both
still a bit raw.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.435
So...

13:30.519 --> 13:32.604
how about we take
a little break?

13:32.687 --> 13:35.065
I found some crazy deals online.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.776
I'm-I'm thinking beach trip.

13:37.859 --> 13:42.489
You and me. Somewhere tropical
with a-a fancy hotel.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.657
Bermuda.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.117
- Maybe Saint Lucia.
- Seriously?

13:46.201 --> 13:48.119
Call it a graduation present.

13:48.203 --> 13:52.790
[sighs] I mean,
I want to, but...

13:52.874 --> 13:55.043
Cecil told me the Guardians
are working out some issues,

13:55.126 --> 13:58.046
and I don't know if I can
take off right now.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.006
Well, what about
taking the time to enjoy

14:00.090 --> 14:01.800
your last summer being a kid?

14:01.883 --> 14:05.095
[sighs] I'm not a kid anymore.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.514
Yes, I know that.
You're an adult.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.432
But that means
making your own choices.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.768
- You don't have to do
everything Cecil tells you.
- Yeah, Mom,

14:11.851 --> 14:13.478
I kind of do.

14:13.562 --> 14:17.107
The last time I did this on my
own, half a city got destroyed.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.609
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.778
Let me finish.
I understand why you think

14:21.861 --> 14:24.281
you have to prove yourself,
but you don't.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.699
You're a good person.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.492
No one thinks you're gonna
turn out like your father.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.536
Well, then why
would you even say it?

14:29.619 --> 14:31.871
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.082
[Cecil over earpiece] Mark,
I need you.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.418
- Thank God.
- What?

14:36.501 --> 14:38.461
- I have to go.
- Wait, Mark. Wait.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.381
[door opens, closes]

14:43.883 --> 14:45.552
[sighs]

14:45.635 --> 14:47.470
[Rex groans]

14:47.554 --> 14:48.930
- I quit.
- [panting]

14:49.014 --> 14:52.392
I'm done.
Fuck your training, man.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.895
[grunts]

14:55.979 --> 14:57.939
People try and kill me

14:58.023 --> 14:59.649
every single day.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.527
Look, I don't need
that shit at home.

15:02.611 --> 15:06.239
[groans] Somebody got me
in the balls.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.532
Maybe if you trained more

15:07.616 --> 15:09.409
and complained less,
we could get back

15:09.492 --> 15:12.245
- to saving lives.
- [sighs]

15:12.329 --> 15:14.706
We just stopped him
from being that guy,

15:14.789 --> 15:16.875
and now we've got you?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.920
Ugh, fuck my life.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.924
[Dupli-Kate giggles, moans]

15:25.008 --> 15:26.843
[giggles]

15:26.926 --> 15:30.180
[singsongy] Kate? Is that you?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.765
I've got a boo-boo

15:31.848 --> 15:34.184
that could use
some dupli-kisses.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.269
[laughs]

15:36.353 --> 15:37.937
- [gasps]
- First of all,

15:38.021 --> 15:39.731
- We are not dating.
- [sighs]

15:39.814 --> 15:42.651
And second, that's inappropriate
language for the workplace.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.195
So kiss your own boo-boo...

15:45.278 --> 15:48.740
boo... boo... [moans]

15:48.823 --> 15:50.867
Wait, I know that look.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.328
- [sighs]
- [sighs] Oh,

15:53.411 --> 15:55.038
are you shitting me?

15:55.121 --> 15:58.249
You goddamn geriatric hypocrite.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.127
This is none of your business.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.421
- Aw, come on!
- You and I were never a thing.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.549
The Immortal and I are.
Deal with it.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.842
Kate.

16:07.926 --> 16:11.721
Don't do this. Please.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.225
[TV announcer]
We called them heroes,

16:15.308 --> 16:18.019
role models, protectors.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.355
But no one ever expected to call

16:20.438 --> 16:23.233
the Guardians
of the Globe victims.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.944
Welcome to our first annual
commemoration

16:26.027 --> 16:28.113
of the massacre
that shook the world.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.449
- We begin by honoring Aquarus,
King of Atlantis.
- [knock on door]

16:31.533 --> 16:33.284
- [sighs]
- Aquarus first won hearts

16:33.368 --> 16:35.453
and minds when he
singlehandedly rescued...

16:35.537 --> 16:37.122
Hi, Rus.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.498
Yes, Rus.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.709
I know you lost your job,

16:40.792 --> 16:44.212
but the rent's been due
for months. So, you know...

16:45.505 --> 16:47.757
- I do?
- [TV announcer] ...served
as a symbol for those of us

16:47.841 --> 16:49.384
who feel different...

16:49.467 --> 16:50.677
Just find a way
to pay your bills,

16:50.760 --> 16:53.221
or I need you out
by the end of next week.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.473
[TV announcer] Next,
we honor the Guardians'

16:55.557 --> 16:57.684
fallen green do-gooder:

16:57.767 --> 16:59.310
Martian Man.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.396
He may have come
from the stars,

17:01.479 --> 17:03.189
but Martian Man will always be

17:03.273 --> 17:06.151
one of Earth's
greatest superheroes.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.444
While taking on bigger threats

17:07.527 --> 17:09.194
was part of his job
as a Guardian,

17:09.279 --> 17:10.989
Martian Man always

17:11.071 --> 17:14.576
made time to help
first responders on the scene.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.327
With his gentle nature

17:16.411 --> 17:19.289
and kind spirit,
Martian Man made Earth

17:19.372 --> 17:20.874
his home.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.382
[Cecil over earpiece]
Here's the need-to-know.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.217
We've had multiple

17:31.301 --> 17:33.261
corroborated sightings
of Darkwing,

17:33.344 --> 17:36.181
which is perturbing to me,
considering that I personally

17:36.264 --> 17:39.142
ID'd what was left
of his rib cage last year.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
Oh, uh, sorry.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.398
It's okay.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.567
So, observe and report?

17:47.650 --> 17:49.903
That's why you're
employee of the month, kid.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.907
Midnight City.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.450
Been a virtual no-man's-land

17:55.533 --> 17:58.453
since the Midnight Magician
cursed it back in '02.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.079
So when you say "cursed,"

18:00.163 --> 18:02.373
is that, like, a metaphor or...

18:02.457 --> 18:04.167
[gasps]

18:04.250 --> 18:06.377
What the hell?

18:06.461 --> 18:07.879
I mean it's cursed.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.673
Permanent midnight,
perpetual darkness.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.759
Summer on the dark side
of the moon.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.810
So weird.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.688
[laughs] Hm...

18:25.772 --> 18:28.066
Let me know when
you're done playing tourist.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.950
Oh, oh, God. Help. Help!

18:37.033 --> 18:39.285
Please, somebody help me!
[grunts]

18:41.037 --> 18:42.831
Ple...

18:43.873 --> 18:45.667
Aah!

18:45.750 --> 18:47.961
Please...

18:48.044 --> 18:50.338
s-somebody help me.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.468
I am helping.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.637
[exclaims]

18:57.720 --> 18:58.972
[grunts]

18:59.055 --> 19:00.557
Helping make sure scum like you

19:00.640 --> 19:03.351
never hurt another
innocent person again.

19:03.434 --> 19:06.646
[grunts]

19:09.566 --> 19:11.359
[gasps]

19:11.442 --> 19:12.819
[groans]

19:12.902 --> 19:14.821
Come on, man.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.656
Darkwing was at
my 12th birthday party,

19:16.739 --> 19:19.242
so I'm pretty sure
he doesn't kill people.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.286
Also, pretty sure he's dead.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.621
Killed by your father,
Invincible.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.415
Which is why
I carry on his work.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.584
I was Night Boy, his assistant.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.461
Assistant?
Wait, you mean sidekick?

19:30.545 --> 19:32.881
We don't use that term.

19:32.964 --> 19:36.384
It's degrading.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.220
[Cecil] Okay, bring him in.
He's lost it.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.305
You think?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.098
- You hear them, too?
- Huh?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.267
The voices.

19:44.350 --> 19:48.563
Oh, man... Hey, you're coming
with me. Okay?

19:48.646 --> 19:52.066
I'm not going anywhere
with the son of a psychopath.

19:52.150 --> 19:55.737
Hey, I'm being nice,
so watch it.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.655
[grunts]

19:58.615 --> 19:59.824
Huh?

20:04.162 --> 20:06.539
[grunts]

20:06.623 --> 20:07.206
Ow.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.917
I felt that.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.501
My predecessor developed

20:10.585 --> 20:12.629
this exoskeleton
to help even the field

20:12.712 --> 20:14.130
against those like you.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.508
But that's not what you
should be worried about.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.428
Hey, man, I said I felt that
punch. I didn't say it hurt.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.888
[grunts]

20:23.306 --> 20:24.807
[grunts]

20:24.891 --> 20:26.809
[shouts, grunts]

20:26.893 --> 20:29.062
[both grunting]

20:29.145 --> 20:31.105
Aah!

20:31.189 --> 20:34.192
Welcome to the Shadowverse.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.527
There are dark things here.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.696
Hungry things.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.282
Even I don't dare
to stay too long.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.285
But I hope you like it,

20:44.369 --> 20:48.706
because you are never leaving.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.250
I liked the old Darkwing better.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.377
I'm the hero here!

20:52.460 --> 20:54.087
I'm saving the world

20:54.170 --> 20:56.297
from Omni-Man's son.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.967
[gasps, grunts]

20:59.050 --> 21:00.718
Hey, don't call me that.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.930
Let go. [grunts]

21:04.013 --> 21:06.099
Not until you take me back.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.851
[alien growling]

21:08.935 --> 21:12.063
Hmm. Guess who
they'll eat first.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.399
[Night Boy gasps]

21:15.733 --> 21:17.151
[grunts]

21:17.235 --> 21:19.112
[gasps] You would never.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.323
Like you said,
I'm Omni-Man's son.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.160
You have no idea

21:26.244 --> 21:28.454
what I'm capable of.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.790
[gasps]

21:32.083 --> 21:35.294
There. Now let go of... [grunts]

21:35.378 --> 21:36.546
[grunts]

21:42.218 --> 21:43.678
[Cecil] Mark?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.930
We lost you for a minute.
Where were you?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.890
You'll have to ask
Darkwing's sidekick.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.477
When he regains consciousness.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.396
[chuckles] Okay.
Bring him in.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.940
I got to sign off.
Something just came up.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.608
Anything I can do?

21:57.692 --> 21:59.068
I doubt it.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.572
Debbie,
what a pleasant surprise.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.323
What can I do for you?

22:04.407 --> 22:05.742
Mark almost missed

22:05.825 --> 22:07.952
his high school graduation
because of you.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.746
He only gets one of those.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.748
He's barely 18, Cecil.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.083
Mark came to me.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.836
I'm looking out for him. I'm
easing him back into the job.

22:16.919 --> 22:20.506
It's not a job. And he's not
your... your-your soldier.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.216
You can't just order him around.

33:40.394 --> 33:42.229
There's excellent local transit.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.856
[wife] Of course I don't.
I just think...

33:43.939 --> 33:45.232
It's not happening.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.359
When you earn the money,

33:47.443 --> 33:49.945
you can decide where we live.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.530
She's not your pet.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.574
What was that?

33:53.657 --> 33:55.200
Did we mention
the spacious garage?

33:55.284 --> 33:57.202
Why don't you all go ahead?
I'll meet you there in a jiffy.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.871
[scoffs]

34:01.248 --> 34:02.875
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

34:02.958 --> 34:04.460
- I'll call you later.

[Cecil over earpiece] What
the hell's going on down there?

34:31.027 --> 34:35.282
Your file on Atlantean law
needs some serious updating.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.824
- This wasn't the deal.
- Huh.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.619
I'm pulling you out.
Backup's on the way.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.710
Huh.

Now's your chance.
Get out of there.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.943
Huh?

35:57.781 --> 36:01.159
Cecil, that thing got loose.
It's killing everyone.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.703
Well they should have
thought about that before they

36:02.786 --> 36:04.121
brought it home from the store.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.081
I can't leave
those people to die.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.084
They tried to kill you.
They were cheering.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.045
All they wanted was justice
for what my dad did.

36:14.047 --> 36:16.800
You're not your father, Mark.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.264
That's why I'm going back.

Ugh... Ah...

38:00.570 --> 38:02.489
[Cecil over earpiece]
You got lucky this time.

38:02.572 --> 38:03.824
Lucky?

38:03.907 --> 38:05.158
Atlantis is calling it even

38:05.242 --> 38:07.369
since you saved
the Queen's life.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.163
The next time
I give you an order,

38:10.247 --> 38:12.332
you listen.

38:12.416 --> 38:15.127
Pull up the audio
from that fight.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.921
- [Depth-Dweller growling]
- [Mark grunting]

38:18.005 --> 38:20.090
- [Depth-Dweller shrieks]
- [Mark screaming]

38:20.173 --> 38:22.175
Get it to the boys in R & D.
I want a report in a week.

38:22.259 --> 38:23.385
Yes, sir.

38:26.555 --> 38:30.267
Sir, when Debbie came to speak
with you, she seemed, uh...

38:30.350 --> 38:33.520
distressed when she...
when she saw me.

38:33.603 --> 38:34.855
Well, she's a distressed person.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.398
After the number
Nolan did on her,

38:36.481 --> 38:38.734
who knows what's going
through her head.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.277
Anything else, Donald?

38:42.320 --> 38:44.239
No, sir.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.539
Ugh.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.458
[sighs]

38:54.541 --> 38:56.126
[Eve] Why would you do that?

38:56.209 --> 38:58.086
We don't want your fake food

38:58.170 --> 39:00.505
or your fake gold.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.591
They're not fake.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.469
But... [sighs] I get it.

39:05.552 --> 39:09.264
You had your job for years
and losing it must feel awful.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.350
I know how hard you worked
to provide for mom and me.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.436
No one is trying
to take that away from you.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.605
But you got to
get over this stupid

39:16.688 --> 39:18.190
"man of the house" thing.
I'm trying to help.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.983
[grunts] Oh, yeah?

39:20.067 --> 39:22.235
Like you helped Chicago?

39:22.319 --> 39:24.071
- Adam, don't.
- What?

39:24.154 --> 39:25.781
[grunts] The whole lot

39:25.864 --> 39:28.075
was unstable, that's why

39:28.158 --> 39:29.785
the city never built there.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.163
It's a miracle
nobody was killed.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.415
This is what happens
when you think rules

39:35.499 --> 39:37.876
are just for us
pathetic normal people.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.378
Your powers
don't make you a hero.

39:40.462 --> 39:43.256
- They make you dangerous.
- [Eve sighs]

39:43.340 --> 39:45.550
I have to go.

39:45.634 --> 39:49.596
Don't come back until
you've figured that out.

41:22.772 --> 41:25.692
And over here
is our training room.

41:25.775 --> 41:28.820
Wow. Look at all those...

41:28.904 --> 41:30.697
those things.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.408
Ooh why don't you show him
the shower, Immortal?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.076
It's super roomy.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.996
You could do anything
in there, right?

41:38.079 --> 41:40.332
And you all get to live here?

41:40.415 --> 41:43.251
Play your cards right
and maybe you can, too, someday.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.587
The Guardians could use
someone with your talents.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.088
Really?

41:47.172 --> 41:49.841
Forgive me for questioning
your authority, Immortal,

41:49.925 --> 41:52.302
but we don't know anything
about the Shapesmith.

41:52.385 --> 41:53.637
[Shapesmith] I can tell you.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.097
I can tell you. I can tell you.

42:25.669 --> 42:28.964
I swore to use my abilities
for good and to help people

42:29.047 --> 42:32.509
and to protect my planet,
no matter what.

42:38.181 --> 42:40.225
Because I am a normal

42:40.308 --> 42:42.394
human superhero.

42:45.563 --> 42:46.773
Am I in?

42:50.277 --> 42:54.322
[Supreme Lizard] Yes,
we were defeated. Yes,

42:54.406 --> 42:56.866
it was embarrassing.

42:56.950 --> 43:00.954
Yes, it was my plan.

43:01.037 --> 43:03.623
But we are not a joke,

43:03.707 --> 43:08.003

[all] We're unstoppable.
We're unstoppable.

And under my leadership,

43:21.516 --> 43:24.394
instead of that fool,
King Lizard,

43:24.477 --> 43:27.397
we will rise again,

44:11.191 --> 44:12.901
Who the hell are you, anyway?

44:14.277 --> 44:16.237
Think of me as an old friend.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.073
An old friend who can help you,

44:18.156 --> 44:20.867
given your current predicament.

44:22.035 --> 44:23.453
Fine.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.998
They were smart.

44:27.082 --> 44:29.250
After our ultimatum,
they ambushed my dad

44:29.334 --> 44:31.753
with experimental quantum bombs.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.172
Still cost them most of Europe.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.549
[chuckles]

44:36.633 --> 44:38.343
Then they just...

Caught me when I finally
had to sleep.

Hmm. Interesting.

- Freeze!
- Who the hell are you?

44:52.399 --> 44:55.860
- That's what I said.
- Me? I'm not your problem.

44:55.944 --> 44:59.322
Then whose problem are you?

44:59.406 --> 45:02.659
His. Well, not his, but...

45:04.077 --> 45:06.246
...close enough.

to your world.

Stop. Hey, you promised
you'd help me. Hey.
