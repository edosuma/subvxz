I can tell you my family was different.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.500
But all families have something in common.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.416
They follow us.

24:04.500 --> 24:09.666
For good, for bad.
They stay, like they become an atmosphere.

24:12.625 --> 24:16.500
And sometimes, we think that
by doing something very specific,

24:16.583 --> 24:19.750
we can change everything,
and not be like them.

ELSA: When I was a kid,

25:21.208 --> 25:24.041
my dad used to tell me stories
about my crazy Aunt Frances.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.416
He said that if I misbehaved,

25:34.500 --> 25:36.291
she would unlock her tomb

25:36.666 --> 25:39.625
and come out and pull me back in there
with her for company.

25:40.375 --> 25:44.125
She was positive that she'd come back
from the dead at some point, and she knew

25:45.250 --> 25:47.250
that when she did, she'd need...

25:49.208 --> 25:50.333
