WEBVTT

00:04.417 --> 00:07.187
Ooh, that smells good.

00:07.220 --> 00:08.388
I'm starving.

00:08.421 --> 00:09.722
Actually, this isn't for you.

00:09.755 --> 00:12.024
I made you guys...

00:12.058 --> 00:14.026
something else.

00:16.862 --> 00:18.098
Scrambled eggs?

00:18.131 --> 00:20.700
A dish so pedestrian
its name is the recipe?

00:20.733 --> 00:22.244
Yeah, what's the other thing?
I want that.

00:22.268 --> 00:24.237
Oh, this?
This is nothing.

00:24.270 --> 00:27.073
Just something I'm throwing
together for my veterans group.

00:29.075 --> 00:30.543
This is breakfast lasagna.

00:30.576 --> 00:32.445
That's Lindsay's favorite dish.

00:32.478 --> 00:34.714
You don't have to lie
about your feelings for her.

00:34.747 --> 00:36.048
Really?

00:36.082 --> 00:37.259
Shit, yeah!
We're really invested in this.

00:37.283 --> 00:38.418
We want this to happen.

00:38.451 --> 00:40.953
Aw, thanks, guys.
'Cause whatever happens,

00:40.986 --> 00:42.088
it's gonna be hilarious.

00:42.122 --> 00:43.456
This is like TV for us.

00:43.489 --> 00:45.258
Either they'll be banging
like zoo monkeys

00:45.291 --> 00:47.093
or... even better...
She rejects him.

00:47.127 --> 00:48.928
All right, guys. What
if they got married?

00:48.961 --> 00:51.264
Then he'd be married to Lindsay.

00:51.297 --> 00:52.365
I think I've got it.

00:52.398 --> 00:54.267
Oh, my God, their kids
are gonna be so dumb.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.112
They'll be like,
"Hey, let's order some heroin."

00:56.136 --> 00:57.737
"H-How do you use a phone?"

01:01.141 --> 01:02.442
So what do you do today?

01:02.475 --> 01:04.477
Well, my agent called.

01:04.510 --> 01:08.181
I have a meeting with
Jonathan R. Strasburg.

01:09.349 --> 01:12.118
Author of Brunching
with Vagabonds.

01:13.286 --> 01:14.920
The Milkweed of July?

01:14.954 --> 01:16.156
In Keeping with Clem?

01:16.189 --> 01:17.390
So what's the meeting for?

01:17.423 --> 01:18.791
Well, why would any author

01:18.824 --> 01:21.161
want to meet with
another author?

01:21.194 --> 01:22.962
'Cause they admire their work.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.330
He liked your book?

01:24.364 --> 01:25.965
Yeah, a lot of people
liked my book.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.167
You've seen the review.

01:28.334 --> 01:30.970
The thing on the wall
where you live.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.473
You walk by it every day.

01:33.506 --> 01:35.117
Oh, you really put in
the bare minimum effort

01:35.141 --> 01:36.152
being a girlfriend, don't you?

01:36.176 --> 01:37.677
Work smart, not hard, Jimmy.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.245
Anyway, he's looking for someone

01:39.279 --> 01:41.147
to help him on his new project.

01:41.181 --> 01:43.192
Shouldn't you be working on your own book?
Yeah, I am.

01:43.216 --> 01:46.018
But not all of us have
the luxury of just paying rent

01:46.051 --> 01:48.754
whenever we feel like it or,
say, not at all.

01:48.788 --> 01:50.428
Why would I pay you rent?
It's your house.

01:50.456 --> 01:52.692
Your ability to bend semantics

01:52.725 --> 01:55.628
to best fit your financial
interests is quite impressive.

01:55.661 --> 01:57.430
I'm all about that paper.

01:57.463 --> 02:00.266
I got to go. Check in later?

02:00.300 --> 02:02.001
Sorry, check in?

02:02.034 --> 02:04.504
I didn't mean it like that...
Never mind.

02:04.537 --> 02:06.306
Oh, I must know
what Gretchen's doing.

02:06.339 --> 02:08.208
I haven't spoken to her
in minutes.

02:08.241 --> 02:10.142
Shut up. Hey!

02:10.175 --> 02:11.377
Just checking in.

02:11.411 --> 02:13.179
I was out of your sight briefly.

02:13.213 --> 02:15.515
I'll, uh, text you again
at the end of the driveway.

02:15.548 --> 02:16.816
Jesus Christ.

02:38.704 --> 02:42.375
It's hard to explain to someone
who hasn't and probably won't

02:42.408 --> 02:46.346
experience it, but, oh, Lindsay,
pregnancy is so magical.

02:46.379 --> 02:48.248
I mean, my skin is glowing.

02:48.281 --> 02:50.416
My nails are so strong,

02:50.450 --> 02:53.753
and... I just have
this deep inner well

02:53.786 --> 02:56.422
of peace and tranquility.

02:56.456 --> 02:57.757
Vernon, you idiot.

02:57.790 --> 02:59.568
Do you really want the baby
to inhale those fumes?

02:59.592 --> 03:01.361
Use your brain. God!

03:01.394 --> 03:04.830
Anyway, I am so glad I could
loan my husband out to you.

03:04.864 --> 03:06.766
Must be so hard
not having a man around.

03:06.799 --> 03:10.270
I don't know. I just don't want
to be one of those girls

03:10.303 --> 03:13.406
who settles for some doofus
frat boy just because

03:13.439 --> 03:14.674
their butt's starting to sag

03:14.707 --> 03:17.410
and their upper arms chunk out.

03:17.443 --> 03:20.012
Anyway, I got a sign

03:20.045 --> 03:22.248
that my Paulywog still
has feelings for me.

03:22.282 --> 03:23.525
Yo, can I get
this popcorn catalogue?

03:23.549 --> 03:25.418
Which says a lot, considering

03:25.451 --> 03:27.353
he's with someone
as great as Amy.

03:27.387 --> 03:28.588
She a'ight.

03:28.621 --> 03:30.266
What does the clerk's office
want with you?

03:30.290 --> 03:34.226
Ooh, honey, did you patent
an invention?

03:34.260 --> 03:36.061
Right?

03:39.565 --> 03:40.800
Holy shit,

03:40.833 --> 03:42.435
that nerd's 'vorcin' you.

03:42.468 --> 03:44.870
Nice, Paul grew some balls.

03:44.904 --> 03:46.606
You got served!

03:46.639 --> 03:48.408
Literally!

03:48.441 --> 03:50.710
All right, I'm gonna kick it
under that tree

03:50.743 --> 03:53.078
and look at this
popcorn catalogue real quick.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.456
Hey, guys.

04:03.489 --> 04:05.491
Where's Sam? Who knows?

04:05.525 --> 04:08.127
One day he's promoting
some new MMA fighter,

04:08.160 --> 04:11.497
the next he's opening up a bespoke
tailoring shop downtown. Last week,

04:11.531 --> 04:13.132
he didn't even show up
to the studio,

04:13.165 --> 04:14.676
so instead of letting
that time go to waste,

04:14.700 --> 04:16.302
we cut our own shit
to drop online.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.338
Yeah. Okay.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.740
Well, you don't
just drop it online.

04:20.773 --> 04:22.408
We'll build some
word-of-mouth buzz,

04:22.442 --> 04:23.485
I'll leak it to Stereogum...

04:23.509 --> 04:25.745
Uh, we-we uploaded
it this morning.

04:25.778 --> 04:27.980
Yeah, we need you to
go let Sam know for us.

04:28.013 --> 04:29.582
He's gonna be so mad.

04:29.615 --> 04:31.784
Last time he was mad,
he cried for a week.

04:31.817 --> 04:33.653
Then he burnt down
my mom's tool shed.

04:33.686 --> 04:36.389
Now she's keeping all her rakes
in the kitchen, like a chump.

04:37.490 --> 04:38.858
Fine.

04:38.891 --> 04:40.960
By the way, you guys
are now separate clients,

04:40.993 --> 04:42.662
so you will be billed
separately.

04:42.695 --> 04:45.297
But hey, you're paying for
the best in the business.

05:10.255 --> 05:12.992
OPEC price manipulation.

05:14.394 --> 05:15.628
Putanesca!

05:15.661 --> 05:17.530
Hanging roller coasters.

05:17.563 --> 05:18.831
Rafael Nadal.

05:18.864 --> 05:20.633
What do they all have in common?

05:20.666 --> 05:21.834
Um...

05:21.867 --> 05:23.403
Plutocracy.

05:23.436 --> 05:25.505
It's the father
of meta-modernism.

05:25.538 --> 05:27.239
Just got off the phone
with Bill Maher.

05:27.272 --> 05:28.974
He was talking for,
like, a half hour,

05:29.008 --> 05:30.543
but I think I got the gist.

05:31.611 --> 05:33.846
Sit.

05:33.879 --> 05:36.181
Go. Sell me.
Tell me what you know about.

05:36.215 --> 05:38.183
Oh, okay. Um...

05:38.217 --> 05:40.653
well, you won
the National Book Award in 2009.

05:40.686 --> 05:43.856
You were accepted to Harvard
but instead rode...

05:43.889 --> 05:46.559
sh-shipping containers
for three years,

05:46.592 --> 05:48.561
and... Read.

06:00.573 --> 06:02.241
Uh, F-sharp.

06:02.274 --> 06:05.377
Wow, I mean, it's-it's powerful.
Really vividly wrought.

06:05.411 --> 06:06.746
Critique me.

06:06.779 --> 06:08.448
Okay, uh, well, the, um,

06:08.481 --> 06:10.082
image of the endless
Costco aisles

06:10.115 --> 06:13.185
seems somewhat
derivative of DeLillo.

06:13.218 --> 06:14.554
Get out.

06:14.587 --> 06:15.588
I don't understand.

06:15.621 --> 06:17.623
Get... the hell out!

06:17.657 --> 06:20.192
Jesus, fine. Weirdo.

06:20.225 --> 06:22.027
Oh, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

06:22.061 --> 06:25.030
A guy tells you to leave, and
you mope away like Mike Torrez

06:25.064 --> 06:28.468
after he gave away that home run
to Bucky Dent in '78? Come on.

06:28.501 --> 06:30.770
Come on.
Let me take you to lunch.

06:30.803 --> 06:33.439
Oh. Okay. Great.

06:33.473 --> 06:36.676
You're driving. I'm on
a shit-ton of pills right now.

06:43.282 --> 06:45.050
I counted to ten,
and then I just said,

06:45.084 --> 06:47.920
"Cheryl, I will get those to you

06:47.953 --> 06:51.056
right after Derek's birthday
cake in the break room."

06:51.090 --> 06:52.458
And you know what?

06:52.492 --> 06:53.593
She said, "Okay."

06:53.626 --> 06:55.427
Okay.

06:56.862 --> 06:59.999
Uh, okay, uh, Edgar,
why don't you share with us?

07:00.032 --> 07:01.467
What happened
with the mystery girl

07:01.501 --> 07:02.935
you were thinking of pursuing?

07:02.968 --> 07:05.304
Well, um,

07:05.337 --> 07:09.575
I-I-I talked about it
with some friends, and...

07:09.609 --> 07:11.811
they don't think
it's a good idea,

07:11.844 --> 07:13.345
so...

07:13.378 --> 07:14.680
Okay.

07:14.714 --> 07:16.482
Uh, well, thank you for sharing.

07:17.950 --> 07:20.319
Yarg, Captain,

07:20.352 --> 07:22.154
methinks I found a way out.

07:22.187 --> 07:23.489
Good.

07:23.523 --> 07:25.691
Because we can't spend
the rest of our lives

07:25.725 --> 07:28.093
inside the belly of this whale.

07:28.127 --> 07:30.830
Aye, and it looks like this
tight, round hole is the exit.

07:30.863 --> 07:33.699
Ah, I better go first.

07:33.733 --> 07:35.768
Aye, sir, but remember
what happened last time.

07:35.801 --> 07:37.469
You should be
exiting through it,

07:37.503 --> 07:39.338
not putting your penis in it.

07:42.542 --> 07:43.676
Okay.

07:43.709 --> 07:45.678
Okay. So what we just did there

07:45.711 --> 07:47.179
was completely improvised.

07:47.212 --> 07:48.790
Which means we did not
plan it beforehand at all.

07:48.814 --> 07:50.349
Isn't that great?

07:50.382 --> 07:51.860
We have a special treat
for you guys today.

07:51.884 --> 07:53.118
This is Nathan and Nathan.

07:53.152 --> 07:55.521
People call me Tall Nathan.

07:55.555 --> 07:58.357
Well, Nathan and Tall Nathan
are from a local comedy school.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.893
And they're going to be
teaching us a lesson in improv.

08:00.926 --> 08:03.663
Studies show that this can help
with trauma-induced anxiety.

08:03.696 --> 08:05.965
We know what you've
all been through,

08:05.998 --> 08:07.700
and we're sensitive to it.

08:08.768 --> 08:09.702
Okay, let's start.

08:09.735 --> 08:13.338
Who wants to play a gay banana?

08:23.949 --> 08:25.551
My best shits are always here.

08:25.585 --> 08:26.819
I have no idea why.

08:26.852 --> 08:28.664
Wendy, can I get
a couple more shrimp cocktails?

08:28.688 --> 08:31.090
Do you think maybe
we should discuss the job?

08:31.123 --> 08:33.092
Relax. You're so inhibited.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.561
Listen, writing isn't sitting
behind a computer.

08:35.595 --> 08:37.897
Writing is experiencing things,

08:37.929 --> 08:39.364
living.

08:39.398 --> 08:40.909
Look, some of the best writers
in the world

08:40.933 --> 08:42.366
have never written a word.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.703
You want to write?

08:43.736 --> 08:45.037
Here.

08:45.070 --> 08:47.573
Start by getting yourself
a lap dance.

08:47.607 --> 08:49.541
Go ahead.

08:49.575 --> 08:51.210
Go on.

08:51.243 --> 08:52.745
No, no, no, no, no.

08:52.778 --> 08:55.380
Not that one... she's kind of
my strip club wife.

08:56.215 --> 08:57.783
All right, good boy.

08:59.619 --> 09:00.953
Hey.

09:00.986 --> 09:02.722
Do you want to get
a lap dance with me?

09:02.755 --> 09:04.456
Oh, hell yeah, I do.

09:08.728 --> 09:11.764
No, no, no, no,
the one with the C-section scar.

09:11.797 --> 09:13.766
Which one?

09:22.608 --> 09:24.443
What the hell is this?

09:24.476 --> 09:27.647
Legal termination
of marriage contract?

09:27.680 --> 09:29.782
And what... I'm sorry...

09:29.815 --> 09:33.786
What-what is irr...

09:33.819 --> 09:35.655
irrec... irr...

09:35.688 --> 09:37.089
Irreconcilable differences.

09:37.122 --> 09:40.592
It means that things
are so broken

09:40.626 --> 09:42.094
that they can't be fixed.

09:42.127 --> 09:43.796
Like when you put
all those pennies

09:43.829 --> 09:45.097
down the garbage disposal.

09:45.130 --> 09:47.099
We had sex last week.

09:47.132 --> 09:48.300
Yes, Paul told me.

09:48.333 --> 09:51.103
We have no secrets.

09:53.673 --> 09:55.007
Stop doing that.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.608
What are you saying about me?

09:56.642 --> 09:58.310
I'm going to go check on Conor.

09:58.343 --> 09:59.645
He's been pretty depressed.

09:59.679 --> 10:02.815
I'm afraid he's going to pet
that poor dog bald.

10:05.851 --> 10:08.287
I saw you watching me kiss Edgar
at the get-together.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.089
We both felt it.

10:10.122 --> 10:12.124
I'm gonna get you back.

10:12.157 --> 10:14.026
No, Lindsay.

10:14.059 --> 10:15.828
You're really not.

10:15.861 --> 10:17.863
Have fun having hand sex

10:17.897 --> 10:20.232
with your girlfriend
in the woods.

10:22.902 --> 10:24.136
If you must know,

10:24.169 --> 10:27.639
I'm able
to finish with her regular!

10:31.711 --> 10:33.645
Sam?

10:48.493 --> 10:50.896
Sam?

10:50.930 --> 10:52.364
What's going on?

10:52.397 --> 10:54.566
Why'd you rebuild
your panic fort?

10:54.599 --> 10:55.868
If you were abandoned

10:55.901 --> 10:57.536
and left for dead
by your best friends,

10:57.569 --> 10:58.838
you might do the same.

10:58.871 --> 11:00.740
You just gonna hang out
in your fort all day?

11:00.773 --> 11:02.507
Does it look like
I'm just hanging out?

11:02.541 --> 11:04.877
I already recorded
a response diss track.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.346
And it is brutal.

11:07.379 --> 11:09.548
Turns out, Honey Nutz rhymes
with Honey Butts!

11:09.581 --> 11:12.184
Okay, before you do anything,
just don't upload it to the...

11:13.385 --> 11:14.887
Too late. All right, that's it.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.732
I'm organizing a sit-down
between the three of you.

11:16.756 --> 11:18.858
You do not tell me
what to do, Gretch!

11:18.891 --> 11:20.059
I'm a man.

11:20.092 --> 11:22.361
I'm a full-grown,
shave-every-day,

11:22.394 --> 11:24.997
went-to-Tokyo-by-myself man.

11:25.030 --> 11:27.366
Fine.

11:27.399 --> 11:30.202
Hey, why don't
we go get something to eat, huh?

11:30.235 --> 11:32.938
My treat.
Any restaurant you want.

11:32.972 --> 11:34.506
Nobu?

11:34.539 --> 11:35.908
Any cheap diner you want.

11:38.543 --> 11:40.412
Um, okay, you, blue shirt.

11:40.445 --> 11:42.882
Why don't you come up
and tag on in? Yeah, come on.

11:42.915 --> 11:45.751
Thank you. All right.

11:45.785 --> 11:48.587
And... go.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.423
Well, since there aren't
any lions,

11:51.456 --> 11:54.760
I guess we'll just have
to train all these elephants!

11:54.794 --> 11:56.028
Th...

11:56.061 --> 11:58.197
Then I think we're gonna need
a bigger shovel.

11:58.230 --> 12:00.365
Good thinking!
Unfortunately,

12:00.399 --> 12:04.736
all I have is this fork.

12:04.770 --> 12:06.738
Um...

12:06.772 --> 12:08.607
uh, w... um...

12:08.640 --> 12:11.877
I'm sorry. I don't
think I'm very good at this.

12:11.911 --> 12:14.880
Look, you're fine.
Remember, never bail out.

12:14.914 --> 12:17.582
When you're scared,
just trust your instincts.

12:17.616 --> 12:19.751
Okay.

12:19.785 --> 12:22.154
Um...

12:24.489 --> 12:27.259
Thanks for the fork.

12:28.994 --> 12:33.132
Unfortunately, I've
been using my hands.

12:45.644 --> 12:47.012
Wow.

12:56.621 --> 12:57.923
Oh, hell no!

12:57.957 --> 12:59.458
Just give me
five minutes.

12:59.491 --> 13:00.993
How much do I do for you?

13:01.026 --> 13:03.829
I buy your drugs. I got
your mom into that condo.

13:03.863 --> 13:05.164
I stopped you from investing

13:05.197 --> 13:07.032
in Sufjan Stevens'
broth restaurant.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.434
Five minutes.

13:09.468 --> 13:13.272
And I'm taking my chicken
tendies to go. Okay.

13:13.305 --> 13:15.674
I heard your song.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.442
Yeah, that was real low,

13:17.476 --> 13:19.211
telling the world
about my fake nut.

13:19.244 --> 13:20.946
I should have said
you have no nuts,

13:20.980 --> 13:23.182
recording tracks behind my back!

13:23.215 --> 13:24.950
Treating me like you Salt-N-Pepa

13:24.984 --> 13:26.451
and I'm Spinderella and shit!

13:26.485 --> 13:29.021
Spinderella would never hack
a brother's Netflix queue!

13:29.054 --> 13:31.023
I had, like, 500 things
I wanted to watch.

13:31.056 --> 13:33.725
Now the only thing I can
remember is Peaky Blinders.

13:33.758 --> 13:36.728
Hey, hey! What happened
to you guys?

13:36.761 --> 13:39.865
Working together used to be,
like, your favorite thing to do.

13:39.899 --> 13:41.867
All you did was skate and record

13:41.901 --> 13:44.970
and throw ice at the guy handing
out Jimmy Kimmel tickets.

13:45.004 --> 13:46.671
You guys were like brothers,

13:46.705 --> 13:48.874
living together
in that one-bedroom in Venice.

13:48.908 --> 13:51.043
You all take turns
between the bed, the couch,

13:51.076 --> 13:52.878
and the baby pool
filled with pillows.

13:54.046 --> 13:55.347
Remember when I got blown

13:55.380 --> 13:57.883
in that pool
by the UCLA German professor?

13:57.917 --> 14:00.886
"Your penis was at achtung!"

14:01.921 --> 14:03.989
See?

14:04.023 --> 14:06.191
You guys make an awesome team.

14:06.959 --> 14:09.094
I'm sorry.

14:09.128 --> 14:10.939
- Yeah, that was mean of us.
- Me, too, man.

14:10.963 --> 14:13.698
- All of them?
- Yeah.

14:13.732 --> 14:14.900
Wait. Bitch!

14:14.934 --> 14:16.535
You just made an eloquent speech

14:16.568 --> 14:17.937
that I greatly appreciated.

14:17.970 --> 14:19.114
Flip the table and storm out.

14:19.138 --> 14:20.105
This table's a classic.

14:20.139 --> 14:21.373
I will do no such thing.

14:21.406 --> 14:22.908
Pitchfork just posted
a whole thing

14:22.942 --> 14:24.543
on your beef. It's blowing up.

14:24.576 --> 14:25.544
For real?

14:25.577 --> 14:27.279
Guys, this has gone too far!

14:27.312 --> 14:28.780
Threatening each other's lives?

14:28.813 --> 14:30.950
Telling each other to suck
each other's dicks?!

14:32.952 --> 14:35.687
Well, if these bitches

14:35.720 --> 14:37.689
do not suck my dick

14:37.722 --> 14:39.758
sometime in the
immediate future,

14:39.791 --> 14:41.593
I will kill they asses!

14:41.626 --> 14:44.196
W-Well, well, my-my schedule

14:44.229 --> 14:48.733
is too full from writing dope
raps to suck your dick!

14:48.767 --> 14:52.737
Yeah! And Jaclyn and I recently
decided to become exclusive,

14:52.771 --> 14:54.940
so I don't think she
would appreciate me

14:54.974 --> 14:57.542
sucking your dick!

14:58.577 --> 15:00.012
Just knock some shit over.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.496
Rap beef! Rap beef! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.655
We out of here... we
out of here, 'Stain.

15:17.029 --> 15:19.631
Oh, my God, I was so scared.

15:23.202 --> 15:24.569
What are we doing here?

15:24.603 --> 15:27.806
Gazing into the darkness,
seeing if it gazes back.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.243
Hi, Mommy.

15:31.276 --> 15:34.413
This is Jimmy.
He's my new friend.

15:34.446 --> 15:38.017
Jimmy, talk to her for a bit.
Oh, uh...

15:38.050 --> 15:43.122
Uh, Mrs. Strasburg, your son
is a really big influence on me.

15:43.155 --> 15:45.190
You must be very proud.

15:48.227 --> 15:51.130
Oh, this room is quite nice,
I must say.

15:51.163 --> 15:53.598
Ooh. Shh, shh.

15:53.632 --> 15:55.467
It's okay. It's okay.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.869
Oh, it's like a glove full
of pencils.

16:00.172 --> 16:03.042
"I do not know which to prefer,

16:03.075 --> 16:06.678
"the beauty of inflections
or the beauty of innuendos,

16:06.711 --> 16:10.449
the blackbird whistling
or just after."

16:10.482 --> 16:13.018
Wallace Stevens.

16:13.052 --> 16:15.887
Who are you, and why are you
holding my mother's hand?

16:25.097 --> 16:27.066
I stole some checkers
from the rec room.

16:27.099 --> 16:28.567
Just making a little chaos.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.035
What the hell was that?

16:30.069 --> 16:32.171
That wasn't your mum, was it?
No, no.

16:32.204 --> 16:35.040
She's, uh... she's back in Boca.

16:35.074 --> 16:37.809
How long were you talking
to that old lady, you weirdo?

16:38.943 --> 16:40.479
I'm going home.

16:40.512 --> 16:42.681
I read your book.

16:42.714 --> 16:44.183
It's amazing.

16:44.216 --> 16:48.387
I loved how Colm, the father,

16:48.420 --> 16:52.023
never took the top all the
way off his cans of beans,

16:52.057 --> 16:54.393
details that say so much

16:54.426 --> 16:57.429
while saying so little.

16:58.430 --> 17:01.600
No one else
ever picked up on that.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.868
Not even Steeb Corniglia.

17:03.902 --> 17:07.339
That's because nobody else
really understood it.

17:07.372 --> 17:09.608
I loved your...

17:09.641 --> 17:13.444
relentlessly aggressive
prosaic style.

17:13.478 --> 17:16.181
I can help you bludgeon
your fear,

17:16.214 --> 17:18.950
teach you to write a book that
will make those smug bastards

17:18.983 --> 17:21.920
and castrating bitches come
crawling back, knees bloodied,

17:21.953 --> 17:23.887
begging for forgiveness.

17:23.922 --> 17:26.125
I would kill to see that.

17:26.157 --> 17:28.292
But... I don't know.

17:28.327 --> 17:30.462
Look,

17:30.495 --> 17:33.132
I need some help
researching this book.

17:39.938 --> 17:42.574
Here's a little advance
in good faith.

17:43.475 --> 17:44.776
What do you say?

17:44.809 --> 17:46.311
You in?

17:46.345 --> 17:48.313
I think... Good.

17:48.347 --> 17:49.781
Good!

17:49.814 --> 17:51.316
Good, good day!

17:51.350 --> 17:52.984
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:53.017 --> 17:55.720
Make a little chaos.

17:55.754 --> 17:59.358
Hey! I'm a writer!

18:02.194 --> 18:04.596
Russell Fleischer. It's Jimmy.

18:04.629 --> 18:06.598
Strasburg loved my book.

18:06.631 --> 18:08.167
Great. So you're taking the job?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.601
Hell no.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.403
I, Jimmy Shive-Overly,

18:11.436 --> 18:14.173
will not be
some has-been's lackey.

18:14.206 --> 18:16.775
That'd be like Thomas Keller
making the donkey sauce

18:16.808 --> 18:19.144
for Guy Fieri's taco burgers.

18:19.178 --> 18:21.346
No, I'm gonna write a new novel,

18:21.380 --> 18:23.315
for I am a writer.

18:23.348 --> 18:25.317
So you don't need
the extra work?

18:25.350 --> 18:27.519
Well, of course I do.
Look, I'm drowning over here.

18:27.552 --> 18:29.188
Just-just find me
something else.

18:29.221 --> 18:31.590
Do your job, man.

18:31.623 --> 18:33.292
So what were the checkers for?

18:33.325 --> 18:36.295
He told me
to "make a little chaos."

18:36.328 --> 18:38.697
What a douche.
I mean, he wanted me to think

18:38.730 --> 18:41.700
he was this eccentric genius
who could mentor me.

18:41.733 --> 18:43.435
But, you know what,

18:43.468 --> 18:45.537
I read some of his book.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.772
It was rubbish, and he knows it.

18:47.806 --> 18:49.941
I mean, I think he just wants
to vampire me

18:49.974 --> 18:52.377
because he thinks I'm a...
I'm a fresh new voice.

18:52.411 --> 18:54.012
And you know what? I am.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.814
And modest, too.

18:55.847 --> 18:59.318
He did give me a wad
of money though.

18:59.351 --> 19:01.353
Oh, I just wrote you a
check for six months' rent.

19:01.386 --> 19:03.655
But I guess
you don't really need it n-now.

19:03.688 --> 19:06.225
And... deposited.

19:06.258 --> 19:07.726
So, how was your day?

19:07.759 --> 19:09.728
Oh, my God,
I have so much to tell you.

19:09.761 --> 19:11.062
See? Aren't you glad

19:11.095 --> 19:13.232
we decided not to "check in"
with each other?

19:13.265 --> 19:15.234
No kidding.

19:15.267 --> 19:18.036
So, I'd basically given up
on this Jolly Rancher,

19:18.069 --> 19:20.572
but then, out of the corner
of my eye...

19:24.343 --> 19:25.744
Hi. Is this Bear Stearns?

19:25.777 --> 19:27.178
I'm looking for Mr. Bear.

19:27.212 --> 19:29.214
I have some extra money
to invest.

19:29.248 --> 19:31.416
Do you have any suggestions?

19:31.450 --> 19:34.753
The sound
investment is... honey!

19:34.786 --> 19:36.821
You're so funny.

19:36.855 --> 19:38.390
You can't invest in honey.

19:38.423 --> 19:39.858
Yes, you can.

19:39.891 --> 19:43.027
I know I did,
when I married you.

20:16.761 --> 20:19.531
Lindsay, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

20:19.564 --> 20:21.266
Um, I'm sort of busy right now.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.734
Well, it's just that...

20:22.767 --> 20:24.279
Uh, Lindsay, how do I say this?
Do you mind

20:24.303 --> 20:25.470
maybe just texting me later?

20:25.504 --> 20:26.905
Wait, but I...

20:32.176 --> 20:33.278
Shit!

20:45.324 --> 20:47.292
"Never bail out."

20:53.865 --> 20:56.368
Hot!

21:00.138 --> 21:01.673
Oh...

22:35.266 --> 22:37.802
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

23:00.959 --> 23:04.763
You know, if you lowered me
about three feet...

23:17.509 --> 23:20.745
I would like to dedicate this
induction to my number-one draft pick,

23:20.779 --> 23:22.814
year in and year out.

23:22.847 --> 23:26.317

has spontaneous
and amazing facial hair...

23:31.623 --> 23:34.125
and the support
of a superhot wife.

23:34.158 --> 23:35.860
