or why he wants to control those dinos.

01:05.607 --> 01:09.277
[whispers]
Uh, I know why. The dude's a total psycho.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.364

[Kash] Yeah. The investors are coming?

Nice! Listen, boss,
Kashmeister is gonna blow their minds.

01:43.061 --> 01:47.732
I'm talking full-scale demonstration.
They'll beg us to take their money.

That's not a lot of time

Yeah, no, I got this.

Or rather, it's found you.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.261
[Kash] It's part of my new fleet
of upgraded models.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.265
I call it BRAD-X.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.392
After you disappeared,

03:04.475 --> 03:06.978
it seemed like a good time
to take this baby for a spin.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.607
BT-dubs, what are you doing out here?

03:11.774 --> 03:15.820
Honestly? I've been cooped up
all day, and I'm bored.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.780
Can't I go for a walk?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.117
Sure you can.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.662
And from now on,
BRAD-X will be right there with you.

What does that mean?

04:04.619 --> 04:05.662
No idea.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.789
But we need to know what Darius knows.

-What's up?

04:33.690 --> 04:34.857
Anything I can help with?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.695
Does this look like something
you can handle?

04:39.529 --> 04:44.617
No, but if there's anything else
you need done, like out there…

04:46.327 --> 04:49.539
You know what? Maybe you can be useful.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.082
Yeah! What do you need?

04:51.165 --> 04:55.169
First thing in the a.m.,
go clean up the jungle biome.

04:55.253 --> 05:00.133
If you can handle that,
I've got something much bigger for you.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.969
-[keyboard clacking]
-No problem. I'm on it.

05:04.178 --> 05:08.141
And if you try anything
you shouldn't, well,

05:08.224 --> 05:12.520
BRAD-X will show you
why that's a painfully bad idea.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.529
That coward turned
a robot loose on a child?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.823
[Mae groans]

05:24.907 --> 05:26.367
That thing was no joke.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.537
Kash went to town on it,
and it didn't even get a scratch.

05:29.620 --> 05:34.125
Just because it's tough on the outside,
doesn't mean it's tough on the inside too.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.462
-What do you mean?
-It's just a robot, right?

05:37.545 --> 05:39.672
Maybe you can shut it down,

05:39.756 --> 05:42.383
or reprogram it
to be good instead of evil.

05:42.467 --> 05:46.345
So if we can find one, B can hack it,
and we can swap it out with Darius's.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.432
Oh! Um, not sure if--

05:49.515 --> 05:51.934
We'd finally have a way
to communicate with Darius!

05:52.018 --> 05:54.520
Wow, Brooklynn.
Is there anything you can't do?

05:54.604 --> 05:59.484
Uh, jump-starting cars, fixing sonars,
robot-reprogramming, nope.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.360
That's all the major life skills.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.403

06:04.572 --> 06:05.990
[whispers]
No big deal.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.244
Well, it's kind of a BD…

06:11.079 --> 06:12.080
Big deal.

06:12.580 --> 06:16.459
Pssh! We've seen your videos.
You've got skills!

06:16.542 --> 06:18.628
Like that time you unboxed Silicon Valley,

06:18.711 --> 06:21.798
"AI, is it our future or our destruction?"

06:21.881 --> 06:22.715
Oh!
[chuckles]

06:22.799 --> 06:26.761
Or when you unboxed Cape Canaveral
and built and coded your own rocket.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.971
It eventually came down…

06:29.514 --> 06:32.934
Or when you unboxed Detroit
and designed your own model electric car!

06:33.017 --> 06:35.394
Personally, I'm a little surprised.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.981
Not that you built an electric car,
but that Yaz knew about it.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.984
Okay, I may have seen
one or two of your videos.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.737
The point is, you did all that cool stuff,

06:44.821 --> 06:47.281
you could totally crush
this robot thing too!

15:00.649 --> 15:02.651
I just, I just can't!

15:12.745 --> 15:15.122
[Brooklynn] This isn't one of my videos.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.457
This is real.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.627
Your videos were real.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.879
[Brooklynn] Yeah, eventually,

15:21.962 --> 15:24.965
after about a hundred outtakes
and mistakes!

15:25.049 --> 15:28.135
That AI programming was way over my head.

15:28.218 --> 15:31.639
The rocket I coded kept blowing up
and that model electric car?

15:31.722 --> 15:35.225
I redid the transmission 17 times!

15:37.102 --> 15:38.562
Darius needs us now,

15:38.646 --> 15:41.231
and we just don't have time
for all my mess-ups.

15:45.069 --> 15:49.740
No. We're sorry
for putting so much pressure on you.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.743
And for thinking that
hacking a robot would be easy.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.163
I didn't. I assumed that's why
we made Brooklynn do it.

16:00.876 --> 16:04.588
I'm out of ideas.
I've tried almost every BRAD-X in here.

Hypothetically, the older model
should be easier to hack,

17:22.249 --> 17:24.334
and we know it can send commands, so…

17:24.418 --> 17:28.380
We can get this BRAD to command
Darius's BRAD-X to listen to him!

17:28.464 --> 17:29.548
That's genius!

17:30.632 --> 17:33.177
I just hope Darius can hang in there
a little bit longer.

Hey! I know what Kash is up to.

Now, if we can figure out
