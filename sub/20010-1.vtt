01:22.649 --> 01:24.116
You mcmasters?

01:25.318 --> 01:26.685
Where's your father?

01:26.687 --> 01:30.289
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

01:30.291 --> 01:33.859
Harry Maddox,
townville financial.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.462
I'm the owner of this shit hole.

01:36.464 --> 01:40.732
- He's not here.
- Yes, I know he's not fucking here.

01:40.734 --> 01:44.303
- But where is he?
- At work.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.638
And what about you, son?
You work?

01:46.640 --> 01:49.675
I use that to make
a little on weekends.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.644
- How much?
- For you? 100 bucks.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.547
100 bucks?

01:55.549 --> 01:58.650
I heard you lived here
all alone.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.853
No dad,

02:00.855 --> 02:02.287
no adult.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.523
Just you

02:04.525 --> 02:07.559
in this dumpy little palace here

02:07.561 --> 02:09.360
all by yourself.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.766
Your father owes me $23,000.

02:14.768 --> 02:19.271
And as much as I'd like you
to mow my lawn

02:19.273 --> 02:21.406
230 times...

02:23.877 --> 02:26.512
He's gotta pay.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.679
- Where is he?
- I told you.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.414
Tell me again!

02:38.291 --> 02:43.562
Perhaps I'm not making myself
clear to you.

02:43.564 --> 02:47.599
A, tell me where your father is.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.268
B...

02:51.771 --> 02:53.939
Let's say you don't
wanna know that option.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.745
Plan b?

03:01.314 --> 03:03.448
- Wait.
- Just a second, son.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.950
No!

03:04.952 --> 03:06.418
Wait!

03:06.420 --> 03:07.653
I don't know where he is!

03:07.655 --> 03:08.887
Is this thing gassed up?

03:08.889 --> 03:11.356
It's been over a month!

03:11.358 --> 03:12.791
Spark plugs maybe.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.259
He has a girlfriend!

03:14.261 --> 03:16.595
- Where?
- I don't know.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.967
No! No! No!

03:32.879 --> 03:34.780
Cut the engine.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.917
Cut it!

03:38.919 --> 03:42.321
Now, get in your car and leave.

03:52.665 --> 03:55.801
You got 48 hours
to get outta here.

03:55.803 --> 03:59.571
You don't live here anymore.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.941
And I'll be seeing you around,
won't I, sweetie-pie?

04:02.943 --> 04:05.310
Sure will.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.395
Go down to miss Johnson's.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.564
She'll find you a place to stay.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.003
Okay?

04:31.005 --> 04:33.505
Ugh! And stay out
of trouble.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.630
Cutshaw, way back!

04:58.632 --> 05:02.401
Oh! Hey, that totally
would have gone in.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.635
Where's this crate?

05:06.372 --> 05:11.076
That crate is in the classified
sector until the 23rd.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.511
No, it's not.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.485
How long till the plane
takes off?

05:20.487 --> 05:21.953
- 20 minutes.
- How far to the airfield?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.323
- 20 miles.
- No problem.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.624
Think that shitty
American junker's

05:25.626 --> 05:26.958
gonna make it to the airfield?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.897
Pardon you, but under the
hood of that junker's

05:31.899 --> 05:35.967
a 402 big block with a 650
carburetor and a 12 bolt rear end.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.904
This beast has 850,000
fucking miles left on it.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.440
We're gonna catch
that goddamn plane, sergeant.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.009
- Buckle up.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.995
Nuclear fusion triggers, sir.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.799
Do you even know what a nuclear
fusion trigger is, sergeant?

06:12.772 --> 06:15.507
Yes, sir. It's an electrical
component that initiates

06:15.509 --> 06:17.709
a nuclear firing sequence.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.811
Sir, I was unaware of that fact.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.813
Shut your bullwash,
you fucking pogue!

06:21.815 --> 06:23.515
At ease.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.551
Do you know what was supposed
to be on that plane?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.019
Yes, sir.
Food, sir.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.623
Right again.
Nutritious, delicious food

06:31.625 --> 06:32.958
for the starving nation
of Malawi.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.159
Unbelievable.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.927
You ever been hungry, mcmasters?

06:35.929 --> 06:38.697
He doesn't know a damn thing
about being hungry.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.638
Captain, there was a mistake
with the inventory, sir.

06:46.640 --> 06:51.042
The... the barcodes,
there was an error,

06:51.044 --> 06:53.779
after which the crate was placed
in the unclassified section,

06:53.781 --> 06:55.947
not the classified.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.716
Barcodes.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.189
You ruined yourself here,
mcmasters,

07:04.191 --> 07:06.792
pulverized your career.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.027
Do you have any idea how far up
this is going to go?

07:10.997 --> 07:13.698
- Sir, I...
- Go ahead.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.801
Apologize, it'll go on record.

07:19.439 --> 07:24.142
Captain starke, sir,
understandably you are very upset.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.077
We all are.

07:26.079 --> 07:30.949
You have been a mentor
to me, and I'm...

07:30.951 --> 07:33.819
- I'm sorry.
- Enough!

07:33.821 --> 07:36.087
Now I'm gonna go on record.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.591
Mcmasters, as sergeant first
class of the fortune cargo bay,

07:39.593 --> 07:42.527
you along with
sergeant Stuart cutshaw,

07:42.529 --> 07:46.097
are responsible for sending
nuclear fusion triggers

07:46.099 --> 07:48.834
to zomba, Malawi.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.903
In doing so, you violated
countless rules and regulations

07:51.905 --> 07:54.539
of the United States
armed forces

07:54.541 --> 07:58.577
and jeopardized the national
security of the United States.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.480
- Sir, if I could just explain.
- No!

08:01.482 --> 08:03.548
No, you'll shut the fuck up
is what you'll do.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.219
I trusted you, mcmasters.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.555
I trusted you and you blew it.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.735
I have to go to the bathroom.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.257
Let the investigator
know they're here.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.177
Oh, Jesus.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.779
Come on, unitas.
You always gotta be such a...

08:34.780 --> 08:35.914
Prick.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.086
They're really gonna love fucking
you at fort sill, aren't they?

08:53.232 --> 08:55.033
Can you believe this shit?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.902
I'm the one who started
that food program,

08:56.904 --> 08:58.670
me, and nobody else
even wanted it.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.772
So I sent the wrong crate
one time,

09:00.774 --> 09:02.641
one time.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.644
Will you, please?

09:10.182 --> 09:11.883
I mean, how many
right crates were sent?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.251
How many little bellies
are now filled

09:13.253 --> 09:14.753
with nutritious foodstuffs?

09:14.755 --> 09:17.088
I don't know,
they never mentioned it.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.659
Which one's unitas's car?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.727
That one.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.199
With a program like this,
mistakes happen,

09:28.201 --> 09:29.834
all the time.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.736
Starke's throwing me
under the bus.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.338
Two years I kissed
that guy's ass.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.420
You know, he once tried
to kiss me when he was drunk.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.710
Really?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.025
How much cash do you got?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.361
- Not much. You?
- Not much.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.363
Mcmasters, how the fuck is that?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.931
You're like the biggest
spender I know.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.267
Yeah, don't worry,
I have credit cards.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.035
What, are you fucking high?

10:04.037 --> 10:05.303
That's the first place
they'll look

10:05.305 --> 10:06.771
to try to trace us.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.142
We need cash.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.311
And... there.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.680
Townville.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.182
How long since
you been home, Princess?

10:17.184 --> 10:18.950
Fuck that town.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.251
We're not stopping there.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.688
- You don't know anyone there?
- No.

10:23.690 --> 10:27.058
No family?
Friends? Baby mama?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.860
Drop it already.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.830
It ain't happening.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.032
How about this option?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.233
What are you doing?

10:35.235 --> 10:37.135
Do not turn
into that bar, sergeant.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.937
Come on.
One drink.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.705
The mp's haven't
talked to the cops yet.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.907
Posse comitatus, motherfucker.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.242
How do you know
who's talked to anybody?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.677
Get back on the road.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.412
Come on!
Have one drink.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.933
You're blocking the door.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.781
Game on, player.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.808
Ted crump, a townville man,

11:49.810 --> 11:52.077
beloved by all.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.912
The champion of progress,

11:55.849 --> 11:58.249
the townville way.

11:58.251 --> 12:03.755
Yes, friend, as your mayor,
we've had some good years

12:03.757 --> 12:05.090
here in townville.

12:05.092 --> 12:09.494
Let's have a few more together.

12:09.496 --> 12:13.164
What is that noise?

12:13.166 --> 12:16.067
We love Ted. We love Ted.

12:16.069 --> 12:20.205
Oh, my goodness!

12:20.207 --> 12:25.744
I'm Ted crump
and you know who I am!

12:27.047 --> 12:30.448
This Tuesday, vote crump.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.183
Crump! Crump! Crump!

12:34.420 --> 12:38.156
We always had a few
Afghan army with us.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.126
They would just stop
in the middle of patrol

12:41.128 --> 12:43.495
and then just roll up a joint

12:43.497 --> 12:44.896
and start smoking it.

12:44.898 --> 12:48.399
- Jesus Christ.
- Like, on patrol.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.968
So you ever been to Kabul there,

12:49.970 --> 12:51.269
soldier slapnuts?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.405
That's on a need
to know basis, turd.

12:54.407 --> 12:57.776
Hey, my name
is Paul Gerard, marines.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.277
Floyd.
Army.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.312
Yeah, all right.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.983
So what, you getting ready to
push overseas here pretty soon?

13:04.985 --> 13:07.452
So are you gonna be
one of those guys

13:07.454 --> 13:09.988
that come back fatter?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.823
What you drinking there?

13:11.825 --> 13:14.526
Sour apple liqueur.
Rocks.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.861
Barman!

13:16.863 --> 13:21.833
Two sour apple liqueur, rocks.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.368
You didn't have to do that.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.404
But I wanted to.
It's my favorite drink.

13:30.943 --> 13:34.345
A lamb cooked on stone,
delicious.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.481
Sprinkle a little
gun powder on it...

13:36.483 --> 13:37.582
I'm serious.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.883
You'll try it.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.123
Can you get us
another one, please?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.025
- Okay.
- That one's on me.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.293
Save it.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.295
The owner comps his drinks.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.996
All of them?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.331
Yeah, some kind
of charity, right?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.567
Why?

13:55.569 --> 13:59.270
Paul here won
the medal of victory.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.471
Come on.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.942
Tell him about it.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.009
Tell him about it.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.911
Come on.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.173
All right, all right.

14:09.548 --> 14:13.218
Me and my 12-man team,
there was a tree line,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.086
a creek, tree line.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.988
We are first group
of guys across

14:16.990 --> 14:18.289
the little creek.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.191
I don't know
what they stepped on,

14:20.193 --> 14:23.528
but they were killed instantly.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.431
Heavy machine guns, rpgs,

14:26.433 --> 14:28.900
I mean, they were just
lighting us up.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.135
So you let off
a few rounds right away,

14:31.137 --> 14:33.504
just to get

14:33.506 --> 14:34.906
control your breathing.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.142
We started putting them down,

14:38.144 --> 14:39.477
a few guys to my left and right,

14:39.479 --> 14:43.248
you know, their guns
stopped firing.

14:43.250 --> 14:47.051
I looked around,
everybody was dead.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.920
Sorry, man.

14:48.922 --> 14:52.123
Then I ran over to one of my
buddies who carries the saw,

14:52.125 --> 14:53.491
you know...

14:53.493 --> 14:55.560
It had full machine gun...
Full auto.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.030
I linked up
a couple hundred rounds

14:59.032 --> 15:00.398
and I watched him walk away,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.000
and I watched the path
that they walked.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.569
I snuck up
to where the house was

15:04.571 --> 15:07.939
and they had
no security outside.

15:07.941 --> 15:13.945
I mean, I said, "fuck it,"
so I kicked in that door.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.047
You know,
I just started shooting.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.017
I ended up killing
everyone in the house.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.618
So I'm staggering
outside the house,

15:20.620 --> 15:24.455
and I get on the radio and I
told them, "send it heavy."

15:24.457 --> 15:26.624
Next thing I remember,
I woke up in the hospital.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.432
You know, I couldn't sleep.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.000
I can't sleep.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.438
And the funniest thing
about it is

15:40.440 --> 15:42.040
through all of that,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.308
they give me this,

15:46.045 --> 15:49.580
because I didn't die.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.616
Like it means something.
Grab it, touch it.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.053
Touch it.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.221
And that little piece of flair

15:57.223 --> 16:01.359
is supposed to make
everything just a-okay.

16:01.361 --> 16:05.029
Now, take this time
you have before you leave,

16:05.031 --> 16:07.699
and look at yourself,

16:07.701 --> 16:11.369
'cause you're never
coming back the same.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.215
Here's to you.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.776
Paul, I'm sick of this shit.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.378
Get over here now.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.679
The wife.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.381
Yeah, I heard you,
your voice carries.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.715
This doesn't look like you
went to the store.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.150
Are you gonna get hit
in the other eye?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.618
I did. I got
groceries in the car.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.286
Are you drunk? Want to get
hit in the other eye?

17:02.288 --> 17:03.621
Wanna few more drinks,
you wanna have a few more?

17:03.623 --> 17:06.523
Can we get a few more
drinks over here?

17:06.526 --> 17:09.060
- Hi, I'm Ann Marie.
- And I'm Reginald.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.728
And we're two
of the happiest people on earth

17:10.730 --> 17:12.630
thanks to the help of one man.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.665
Harold w. Maddox,
of townville financial.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.102
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi Ann Marie.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.505
Hi, Reggie.
How's your new home?

17:20.507 --> 17:23.074
It's everything we ever dreamed
it could be, Harry.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.509
I'm overjoyed.

17:24.511 --> 17:28.246
Friends, you know me,
I'm Harry Walter Maddox,

17:28.248 --> 17:31.582
founder and ceo
of townville financial.

17:31.584 --> 17:35.219
And I'm running to be
your next mayor.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.155
Why, you ask?

17:37.157 --> 17:40.691
Let's just say it's because
I know what dreams are made of.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.532
Yes?

17:47.534 --> 17:49.467
Another round
for everybody, please.

17:49.469 --> 17:53.271
And I say, "be not afraid",

17:53.273 --> 17:58.209
tonight everyone
goes home for supper."

17:58.211 --> 18:01.279
Your life is amazing.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.649
You know what?
It is.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.552
I think...

18:07.554 --> 18:10.321
Oof, I'm drunk.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.356
Stay with me tonight.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.459
What are you doing?

18:14.461 --> 18:16.494
- Hey, let's go.
- You're disgusting!

18:16.496 --> 18:18.162
Hey! What?

18:18.164 --> 18:19.664
No, wait!

18:19.666 --> 18:23.234
What did I do?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.368
Thanks a lot, man.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.237
I was like this close.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.607
Yeah, maybe on a map where
that's like a thousand miles.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.610
- Are you drunk?
- No.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.845
- You drunk?
- No.

18:41.386 --> 18:44.122
2.5! Ooh!

18:48.494 --> 18:49.794
You all right, man?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.129
Always.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.697
You need a ride?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.332
No, uh, no, man, I'm fine.

18:54.334 --> 18:58.202
I'm just gonna just
psych myself up here.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.605
- Hoo-ah.
- Hoo-rah.

19:02.908 --> 19:06.344
Quit, uh, excuse me,

19:06.346 --> 19:07.778
you're driving.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.448
Are you crazy?
I'm not driving.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.450
Well, I'm not driving either.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.593
No, why would I say that?

19:22.595 --> 19:25.263
I love you.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.898
You're drunk.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.433
Hello?

19:29.435 --> 19:32.236
Oh, boy.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.205
It's coming.
Pull over.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.706
- No, hold it in.
- No, pull over.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.508
- Hold it in.
- Pull over.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.697
Whoo!

20:00.933 --> 20:03.534
That's the good stuff.

20:11.476 --> 20:15.379
Can you hear that?

20:19.785 --> 20:22.553
Maybe it's another road?

20:22.555 --> 20:25.856
Yeah.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.658
Another road.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.977
Was that marine
driving a white truck?

21:00.392 --> 21:02.927
Fuck! Fuck!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.962
- In my pocket.
- Just breathe, man.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.530
We'll get you to a hospital.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.035
- Just take it!
- What?

21:11.037 --> 21:13.437
It's the death of me.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.572
Thank you.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.898
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.867
I'm calling police.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.403
You crazy?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.571
We're both awol driving drunk.

21:47.573 --> 21:48.906
And you took his medal.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.541
I didn't take it.
He gave it to me.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.143
Do you think anyone's
gonna believe that?

21:59.351 --> 22:00.818
Fine.

22:03.422 --> 22:05.589
We'll drive a minute,
then call it in.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.766
That's the first dead body
I've ever seen.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.558
How much gas we got left?

22:40.560 --> 22:41.926
Half a tank.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.894
Or less.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.444
Fuck.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.519
Just let me do the talking.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.023
All right, you fucking
perpetrators,

23:13.025 --> 23:14.558
sheriff's department.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.160
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.661
Hands! Now!

23:17.663 --> 23:18.963
Go! Go! Go! Go!

23:20.599 --> 23:21.866
Step outside.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.801
Better keep your hands up.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.736
My partner here is working
on two hours of sleep

23:25.738 --> 23:29.407
and he's got a loaded weapon
pointed right at your head.

23:31.643 --> 23:33.544
Hands on the hood!

23:33.546 --> 23:34.879
It's not our fault.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.847
- You hear that, rayburn?
- Not their fault.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.784
Someone walked into the bar
and force fed these two invalids

23:39.786 --> 23:42.720
a whole pint of whiskey, and then
sent them back out on the road.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.455
Fucking invalids.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.524
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I said shut the fuck up.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.560
Shut the fuck up, yes, sir.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.730
- What's that, chunky?
- Ow! Fucking asshole.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.568
- Shit.
- Did you forget your cuffs again, sheriff?

23:57.570 --> 23:58.850
Get over here
and give me a hand.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.875
- Put the shotgun down.
- Right.

24:07.746 --> 24:08.979
Sheriff.

24:13.518 --> 24:14.852
What is this?

24:17.122 --> 24:20.591
Well, goddamn.
This is yours?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.526
Whose else would it be,
cro-magnon man?

24:22.528 --> 24:24.762
Look!
The medal of victory!

24:24.764 --> 24:26.230
- Damn.
- Look, officer...

24:26.232 --> 24:27.665
He's modest.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.469
Goddamn it, rayburn.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.504
How many times
do I have to tell you?

24:33.506 --> 24:35.172
Put it down.
Now cut it out!

24:35.174 --> 24:37.475
Do you wanna go to jail first
and then to the brig?

24:37.477 --> 24:38.809
It's not mine and never will be.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.978
- I'm not wearing it.
- Just pretend.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.848
Here, put your uniform on,
soldier.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.491
- Perfect!
- Rick Ford.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.493
First name's Rick,
last name's Ford.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.228
Say, I didn't catch
your boys' names.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.829
Well, we're really
in a rush, rickford.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.164
Rick Ford.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.766
Come on, let's go
get you some eggs.

25:02.768 --> 25:05.503
Thank you, but I think we'll
just catch 40 winks right here

25:05.505 --> 25:07.271
until the sun rises.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.140
On the road?
Son, you are drunk.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.043
Come on, you boys
are going with me.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.578
Hop on board.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.923
You boys out on detail
or something?

25:25.925 --> 25:28.659
Personal business stuff
for my family.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.728
It's family business.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.030
It's personal.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.533
Sheriff Ford, call the office.

25:37.669 --> 25:38.936
Hicks, here.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.304
There's bring a break in
at city hall

25:40.306 --> 25:42.106
and a robbery
in the mayor's office.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.744
Mayor's office.
On our way.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.913
Proceed with extreme caution.

25:50.649 --> 25:52.983
And a beautiful morning it is.

25:54.986 --> 25:56.020
Whoo!

26:53.945 --> 26:55.212
Excuse me, ma'am.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.614
Ma'am?

26:58.216 --> 26:59.683
Ma'am?

27:06.157 --> 27:08.959
Did you see either
of these men here last night?

27:24.643 --> 27:27.711
You ready, deputy?

27:27.713 --> 27:28.779
Good man.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.413
Ransacked.

28:02.415 --> 28:04.948
And how many people did you say
you saw on the security tape?

28:04.950 --> 28:09.286
Oh, there were three...
No, uh, maybe four people.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.988
It's cued up on the inside.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.763
Don't you let
anyone see you in there.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.398
When are you gonna
trust me, Wallace?

28:42.854 --> 28:45.022
What are you doing here?

28:45.024 --> 28:46.423
- Beat it!
- You beat it.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.791
- You seen rayburn?
- No!

28:47.793 --> 28:48.892
Sheriff, what happened in there?

28:48.894 --> 28:50.828
You, come with me.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.263
- You, scram.
- Enough.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.999
Let's go, sheriff.

28:56.001 --> 28:59.036
Tell me, Rick,
is that Tennessee whisky

28:59.038 --> 29:01.171
or Kentucky bourbon I smell?

29:10.148 --> 29:11.315
Hi.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.153
- Hold on.

29:20.058 --> 29:21.325
What is it?

29:34.539 --> 29:36.206
I love you.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.347
What the fuck, Floyd!

29:43.349 --> 29:45.849
They say I gotta ship out
to Guam, I go to Guam.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.418
- What was I supposed to do? - You're
supposed to fucking tell me about it.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.987
Well, I'm telling you now.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.288
Oh, my...

29:51.290 --> 29:54.191
Come home.
Just talk to me.

29:55.393 --> 29:56.860
I love you.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.064
- Hello?
- I just got to the airport.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.502
Listen, I'll call home
when I can.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.437
You can go fuck yourself!

30:12.377 --> 30:15.245
Look, they say I go to Guam,
I go to Guam.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.446
Goodbye, Floyd.

30:18.349 --> 30:21.051
- What is that?
- Is this the medal of Vic...

30:21.053 --> 30:22.352
- No.
- It's the medal of victory?

30:22.354 --> 30:24.354
- Well, yeah.
- What's all this shit?

30:24.356 --> 30:26.390
Oh, your boss' office was
just ransacked. Comment?

30:26.392 --> 30:28.258
Do you ever sleep?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.326
Who's this?

30:29.328 --> 30:30.494
It's mcmasters.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.162
Voting for Ted crump, I hope.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.397
I'm not voting for anybody.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.332
- You what?
- He's not voting.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.202
Jonathan Blaine.
It's a pleasure.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.470
Blaine, excuse me, but your
boss's office was just pillaged,

30:40.472 --> 30:42.306
- perhaps you'd like to say something?
- Learn not to fuck up

30:42.308 --> 30:44.041
a few quotes,
I'll give you a few more.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.510
Stay right there,
you look fantastic.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.480
- Listen, Grady.
- No, you listen.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.382
I'm gonna go back in there
and take some pictures.

30:52.384 --> 30:57.221
Here is my cell. If you see anyone
coming close to the building...

30:57.223 --> 30:59.156
- Take the card.
- Listen, Grady, I cannot,

30:59.158 --> 31:02.860
- absolutely cannot get involved in this.
- Why not?

31:02.862 --> 31:04.161
You're here.
You're healthy.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.296
Take the fucking card, Floyd!

31:12.904 --> 31:14.938
- I thought you had no one in town.
- I don't.

31:20.645 --> 31:23.580
Well, swallow your bacon, Ted.
There's been a break in.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.983
What?
Jesus Christ!

31:25.985 --> 31:27.618
That's it, we're ruined.
Ruined!

31:27.620 --> 31:29.987
Deep breaths, Ted.
I've got good news, too.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.489
I found a medal of victory
winner right here in townville

31:32.491 --> 31:34.224
and he's undecided.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.294
A medal of victory winner.

31:37.296 --> 31:41.498
Well, keep him happy.
I'll be out in a minute.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.401
That is why,
if elected your mayor...

31:44.403 --> 31:49.006
No. That is why,
when elected your mayor...

31:49.008 --> 31:52.309
yes?

31:52.311 --> 31:55.946
Thievery? Why,
you have nothing to steal.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.115
I think you staged that
to frame me.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.250
And why would I want
to frame an opponent

32:00.252 --> 32:03.186
who is five points
behind me in the polls?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.391
Because I just pulled ahead.

32:09.494 --> 32:12.596
Well, when you lose on Tuesday,

32:12.598 --> 32:16.133
I am going to cram
my winning headline

32:16.135 --> 32:19.369
right up your
gout-stained asshole.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.947
I've got it, and it's good.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.415
Good, good.
How old is she?

32:31.417 --> 32:33.116
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.719
Today I need a surprise.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.254
See you in 10 minutes.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.994
Look here, if I don't arrange
for mayor crump

32:43.996 --> 32:46.563
to shake hands with the townville
medal of victory winner,

32:46.565 --> 32:49.199
well, sir, it'll be my black
ass bent over backwards.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.334
We have to go.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.636
Oh, we'd love to.
When?

32:52.638 --> 32:54.171
Oh, he's on his way right now.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.006
- Que suerto.
- I can't...

32:56.008 --> 32:58.642
Morning. I'm wendi mann,
I work with Harry Maddox,

32:58.644 --> 33:01.311
the next mayor of...
Oh, my!

33:01.313 --> 33:03.146
Is that a medal of victory?

33:03.148 --> 33:06.283
- Excuse me.
- Harry is going to love to meet you.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.651
He's on his way here right now.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.187
- Fantastic.
- I can't even vote here.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.490
Oh!

33:25.770 --> 33:28.672
Hello, wendi.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.722
Grady here.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.758
Might wanna wrap
things up in there.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.727
- Oh, mcfloyd.
- There's a crowd out here.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.229
Listen, you're not
gonna be out there

33:52.231 --> 33:53.630
when I get out, are you?

33:53.632 --> 33:55.432
Actually, I was thinking
of just leaving town.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.134
Oh, what a pity.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.502
Don't worry. You never
have to see me again.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.037
- Oh, I'm not worried.
- -Me neither.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.471
Well, great, I'm glad we agree.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.306
- Freeze, perpetrator!

34:06.744 --> 34:08.178
Grady?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.346
What the fuck happened?

34:09.348 --> 34:10.447
I got her, sheriff.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.482
Got her?
Or shot her?

34:12.484 --> 34:14.418
Grady's been shot.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.186
Yeah, won't you supposed
to call her or something?

34:16.188 --> 34:18.255
Shit! Shit! Shit!

34:18.257 --> 34:20.056
Floyd!
What about the mayor?

34:21.324 --> 34:22.692
What...
What's happening?

34:22.694 --> 34:26.295
Mr. mayor, we've apprehended
a suspect.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.199
Fine work, sheriff.
Let's make it official.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.639
So there you are.
Come on, hurry up!

34:35.641 --> 34:37.306
We haven't got all day.

34:39.377 --> 34:40.577
Officer!

34:40.579 --> 34:42.279
Asshole!

34:42.281 --> 34:43.813
You're supposed to warn me
before someone comes

34:43.815 --> 34:45.114
- and blows my fucking head off.
- Look at me,

34:45.117 --> 34:47.184
this is all just a big mistake,

34:47.186 --> 34:49.386
- she's a journalist.
- There's no mistake, sergeant.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.755
With my own eyes
I witnessed her crimes.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.558
- Now, come on, Grady!
- No, no! Not until you fucking decide...

34:54.560 --> 34:57.094
- you know I'm up
for a promotion.

34:57.096 --> 35:00.464
How do, everybody? Thank you
so much for coming down.

35:00.466 --> 35:03.500
- Our esteemed sheriff here...
- Mayor crump...

35:03.502 --> 35:06.103
If it true that the city
is in a financial free-fall?

35:06.105 --> 35:08.638
Free-fall?

35:08.640 --> 35:12.642
Ladies and gentlemen,
under my administration,

35:12.644 --> 35:16.313
our town is
at its celestial zenith.

35:19.383 --> 35:21.384
Skip, how's things?

35:21.386 --> 35:22.786
Unemployed.

35:22.788 --> 35:26.523
And my wife left me
because I'm unemployed.

35:26.525 --> 35:30.327
- I... I'm... -you know you
look like a bloated hog.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.329
Hey! You watch your mouth!

35:42.240 --> 35:45.709
Hey!

35:45.711 --> 35:48.178
Where in god's name
did he stash that movie?

35:48.180 --> 35:50.814
Taped to the bottom
of his desk drawer.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.816
- Naughty, naughty Ted.
- Mm-hmm.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.518
I just needed some space,
all right?

35:54.520 --> 35:55.886
Where was he really?

35:55.888 --> 35:57.787
Who knows?
Who cares?

35:57.789 --> 36:00.790
Look, I fucking loved you,
you jerk.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.926
- Sergeant, be quick!
- Mcmasters!

36:02.928 --> 36:05.629
- Over here! Sergeant!
- How did you make the arrest?

36:05.631 --> 36:07.330
- Over here!
- -Back!

36:07.332 --> 36:09.633
- Who fired the gun?
- Mcmasters, who fired the shot?

36:09.635 --> 36:10.867
Sergeant, think quick!

36:10.869 --> 36:12.702
Break it up.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.338
This man won
the medal of victory.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.840
Let go! Move!

36:16.842 --> 36:18.408
Floyd, get me my bag.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.210
Get the bag, Floyd!

36:36.727 --> 36:39.529
Congratulations, boy.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.498
Just smile, I'll do the shaking.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.966
We were dead in the water,
dead in the water!

36:42.968 --> 36:46.770
And then that man right here
charged the enemy line.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.675
Harry Maddox, running for mayor.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.645
Don't fall for his tricks, boy,

36:55.647 --> 36:57.781
he'd steal that medal
right off your chest.

36:57.783 --> 37:00.884
Son, can you trust a man
who has a 70-year-old mistress?

37:03.454 --> 37:06.256
- Grab him!
- Give me that, you goof.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.891
He stole that from my office.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.774
Welcome home, sergeant.

38:44.855 --> 38:48.591
Good morning.

38:48.593 --> 38:51.027
Good morning. My name is
sergeant Floyd mcmasters

38:51.029 --> 38:55.865
and I called earlier about one
of your inmates, Grady walls.

38:55.867 --> 38:59.602
Uh, yes, she is here,
and her bail is set at $10,000.

39:01.605 --> 39:02.772
$10,000?

39:02.774 --> 39:04.040
Yes.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.546
Are you family or spouse?

39:09.548 --> 39:11.348
Neither.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.687
Thank you.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.757
Uh, regarding your visit,
she quotes,

39:20.759 --> 39:24.494
"take that lying degenerate
scumbag back to Guam."

39:28.399 --> 39:30.767
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:32.436 --> 39:35.739
$10,000.
Jesus.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.540
Fuck her.
We got work to do.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.675
Right.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.412
Car's this way.

39:43.581 --> 39:45.415
Yeah, that pukey piece of shit?

39:45.417 --> 39:48.585
I'm not setting foot inside
that car, neither are you.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.421
What are you talking about?

39:51.423 --> 39:53.390
That medal.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.591
It's our ticket outta here.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.427
Aw, hell no!

39:57.429 --> 39:58.561
We go to the car...

39:58.563 --> 40:00.063
And then what, genius?

40:00.065 --> 40:02.999
We gonna hitchhike 900 miles
till we run outta gas?

40:03.001 --> 40:07.170
- We'll figure it out.
- Yeah, that we're broke.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.938
We're not staying here, st...

40:08.940 --> 40:12.809
Look, these two fuck-knobs
need a hero.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.177
To pose with.

40:14.179 --> 40:17.580
And we need cash.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.482
What?
Sell my endorsement?

40:19.484 --> 40:22.519
Hel, yeah.

40:22.521 --> 40:25.088
I'm not endorsing
either of those two runts.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.758
Especially Maddox.
The man's an unruly sociopath.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.593
Okay. And you don't
wanna take his money?

40:30.595 --> 40:32.829
No, I don't wanna
take a dime from him, ever.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.197
In fact, if I never see
his ugly fucking

40:34.199 --> 40:36.166
pickle face again,
it'll be too soon.

40:36.168 --> 40:39.536
Listen, I'm not rotting
in some fort sill shit hole

40:39.538 --> 40:40.870
because you can't face reality.

40:40.872 --> 40:45.575
Face reality?
It's not my medal.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.845
Beep, beep, motherfuckers.

40:48.847 --> 40:49.979
Need a lift?

41:15.873 --> 41:19.175
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, so
glad you could make it.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.910
- Hungry?
- Ravenous.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.950
Welcome mcmasters,
we're proud to have

41:26.952 --> 41:28.852
a true American hero
in our midst,

41:28.854 --> 41:29.886
aren't we folks?

41:29.888 --> 41:31.754
- Hoorah!
- Hoo-ah!

41:31.756 --> 41:33.523
Sorry about the mess here.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.758
Normally we spend our days
providing people

41:35.760 --> 41:38.194
with the right loans.
Cars, houses.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.096
We're the currency
of contentment.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.232
Clean up your fucking desk!

41:45.903 --> 41:47.203
Damn!

41:50.508 --> 41:52.775
Where's the jam?

41:52.777 --> 41:54.644
- Jam?
- For their toast, idiot.

41:54.646 --> 41:56.679
When I called, I specifically...

41:56.681 --> 41:58.882
Oh, just forget about it.

42:00.584 --> 42:03.186
I see you've added
some wings to that waist.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.220
Trim up!

42:07.725 --> 42:09.859
I always tell them,
the only number for me

42:09.861 --> 42:14.163
is 36-24-36.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.798
Harry, isn't it?

42:15.800 --> 42:17.567
How can we help you?

42:19.670 --> 42:22.972
Where you from, mcmasters?

42:22.974 --> 42:25.041
Here.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.643
What street?

42:26.645 --> 42:27.877
West boulevard.

42:29.914 --> 42:32.282
West boulevard.
On the east side?

42:38.255 --> 42:40.189
In any event, welcome back.

42:45.963 --> 42:49.566
Tell me, Floyd, who are you
voting for this election day?

42:49.568 --> 42:51.568
I think I'll be sitting
this one out, actually.

42:51.570 --> 42:53.670
I don't blame you.

42:53.672 --> 42:56.306
You look like a bright guy.

42:56.308 --> 43:01.244
I get that you're a man
who needs some hard evidence

43:01.246 --> 43:04.247
before he goes in
and pulls a lever.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.849
Gentlemen, under
great risk to himself,

43:06.851 --> 43:09.218
one of my operatives
took this video

43:09.220 --> 43:12.889
at a voting registration office
on the north side of town.

43:27.004 --> 43:28.838
- Well, hello.
- Good afternoon.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.775
Hi, come on in.

43:32.777 --> 43:37.914
So, it's 50 bucks for every
family member of voting age.

43:37.916 --> 43:39.749
So write their names down here.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.655
30 seconds.

43:45.657 --> 43:48.891
No! Who are you voting for
on Tuesday?

43:48.893 --> 43:50.159
I'm voting crump.

43:52.262 --> 43:54.030
Good man.
Have a good afternoon.

43:54.032 --> 43:56.799
Good work. I second that.

43:56.801 --> 44:00.103
Things are goings
exactly as I planned.

44:00.105 --> 44:02.071
You know who I am!

44:03.307 --> 44:05.842
See?

44:05.844 --> 44:10.046
Behind every great fortune,
there's a great crime.

44:10.048 --> 44:12.415
Was that last part fake?

44:12.417 --> 44:16.986
Uh, he meant that it was so
shocking that it seemed fake.

44:16.988 --> 44:18.788
What?

44:18.790 --> 44:21.190
Mr. Maddox, your hourly
poll report, sir.

44:21.192 --> 44:24.894
It's saying you're, um,
down by one point.

44:24.896 --> 44:29.032
- Shit. Susan, get your fat ass in here!
- Yes, sir.

44:29.034 --> 44:31.901
What the fuck are you doing
buzzing me during a meeting?

44:31.903 --> 44:33.736
- You said to always...
- Do you wanna work

44:33.738 --> 44:36.439
in the mayor's office
or do you wanna be half a cunt?

44:41.045 --> 44:45.715
Listen, son, I need the services
of a decorated soldier

44:45.717 --> 44:47.984
like yourself for one hour.

44:47.986 --> 44:53.856
And I'm willing to pay.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.892
About $160 a minute.

44:59.029 --> 45:00.797
Shall we dance?

45:00.799 --> 45:02.932
- I'll think it over.
- No! You think about it now!

45:05.402 --> 45:06.803
Is that what I'm worth?

45:06.805 --> 45:09.772
It is today.

45:09.774 --> 45:11.240
- We want double.
- No doubles.

45:20.184 --> 45:22.051
When that phone rings
you pick it up.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.786
It'll be me.

45:23.788 --> 45:26.889
When this deal's down,
we're gonna require

45:26.891 --> 45:29.792
another envelope
of a happier size.

45:29.794 --> 45:31.260
Okay, boys, thank you very much.

45:31.262 --> 45:33.162
It was a pleasure.
Get some rest, you guys.

45:33.164 --> 45:35.832
You both look terrible.
Ta-ta!

45:35.834 --> 45:38.334
I hope your mind's
not as empty as that desk.

45:44.842 --> 45:47.143
Decorated soldier,
like yourself,

45:47.145 --> 45:49.312
for one hour,
and I'm willing to pay.

45:49.314 --> 45:52.415
Hells motherfucking yeah,
sergeant.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.450
What did I tell you?

45:54.452 --> 45:57.386
Mm-mmm.
Smell that money?

45:57.388 --> 45:59.989
Can you believe how Maddox
just shits on his employees?

45:59.991 --> 46:02.325
One day that guy's gonna
get f'd right in the a.

46:02.327 --> 46:05.795
So you wanna stay the hour
or you wanna take off?

46:05.797 --> 46:07.196
Just count me out my half.

46:07.198 --> 46:08.531
I don't if you were
actually listening,

46:08.533 --> 46:09.966
but that wasn't option.

46:09.968 --> 46:13.836
I need it.

46:13.838 --> 46:15.505
- Why?
- Give me the money.

46:15.507 --> 46:19.142
Ooh, now I'm really not gonna
give you the money.

46:19.144 --> 46:20.309
I need to bail Grady
out of jail.

46:20.311 --> 46:22.345
What?

46:22.347 --> 46:26.783
Mcmasters, are you so
profoundly desperate for pussy

46:26.785 --> 46:28.851
that you're willing to spring
your ex-girlfriend

46:28.853 --> 46:30.386
of nine years out of jail?

46:30.388 --> 46:33.189
Just give me the money.

46:33.191 --> 46:34.791
Whatcha gonna do?

46:34.793 --> 46:36.926
You gonna beat me up?

46:36.928 --> 46:40.797
Son! You're a real
bit of hope around here.

46:40.799 --> 46:42.064
Oh, gee, thank you.

46:42.066 --> 46:43.499
Hope you're staying with us.

46:43.501 --> 46:45.301
Actually, we were just leaving.

46:45.303 --> 46:49.038
Leaving? Already?

46:49.040 --> 46:51.207
Son, this is your home.

46:51.209 --> 46:52.441
Not anymore.

46:52.443 --> 46:56.245
Your home's your home.

46:56.247 --> 46:58.314
- Hey.
- Be nice.

46:58.316 --> 47:02.485
You know what I think?
I think this place sucks.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.587
And I think that
every second I spend here

47:04.589 --> 47:08.090
I add one more sucky moment
to my otherwise blissful

47:08.092 --> 47:09.225
little existence.

47:11.395 --> 47:12.562
Taxi!

47:17.835 --> 47:20.903
- What a fucking asshole.
- Right?

47:20.905 --> 47:23.439
African geopolitics
were rocked this morning,

47:23.441 --> 47:26.409
when news spread that the small
African nation of Malawi

47:26.411 --> 47:29.478
may now be armed
with a nuclear device,

47:29.480 --> 47:31.614
due to a mishap
with army logistics.

47:31.616 --> 47:34.383
An investigation
into the matter is underway,

47:34.385 --> 47:36.619
and is expected to reach
the highest levels

47:36.621 --> 47:38.454
of the military.

48:09.453 --> 48:11.020
Motherfuckers.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.641
What?

48:39.082 --> 48:40.383
You bailed me out?

48:42.252 --> 48:44.587
Yeah.

48:44.589 --> 48:46.255
You look awful.

48:48.659 --> 48:50.426
Those are really nice shoes
you're wearing.

48:57.401 --> 48:59.435
Hold on!

48:59.437 --> 49:00.469
Okay.

49:10.714 --> 49:13.082
All right, I'm gonna go.

49:15.652 --> 49:18.154
- That was a mistake.
- Wait a minute.

49:18.156 --> 49:20.489
- Big mistake. Huge.
- Come on, don't you want to hear my story?

49:20.491 --> 49:22.325
Don't worry,
I've heard it all before.

49:22.327 --> 49:24.660
- I had a meeting this morning.
- Oh, really? Fancy, fancy.

49:24.662 --> 49:26.395
Don't you want to know
where your camera is?

49:27.431 --> 49:30.199
- What?
- And your bag?

49:30.201 --> 49:32.101
Come again?

49:32.103 --> 49:33.669
I have a certain
incriminating cassette tape,

49:33.671 --> 49:36.572
but... I guess you just don't
want to know about that.

49:37.708 --> 49:40.309
Well, gotta go.

49:42.347 --> 49:45.281
You think this is some
kind of a game, mcmasters?

49:45.283 --> 49:47.116
No!

49:47.118 --> 49:49.518
Listen, you're gonna tell me
everything I need to know

49:49.520 --> 49:51.587
in the next two seconds.

49:51.589 --> 49:55.358
Oh, okay, okay.
Just let go, Jesus.

49:57.195 --> 49:59.128
Yourself, for about one hour.

49:59.130 --> 50:01.430
- And I'm willing to pay.
- Brilliant.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.532
Listen, if you see him
again, call me.

50:03.534 --> 50:05.034
Thought you wanted me to go.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.675
My husband won one of those,
you know.

50:13.777 --> 50:16.312
Husband?

50:16.314 --> 50:17.646
Fought in naziriyah.

50:21.218 --> 50:24.086
It was posthumously awarded.

50:24.088 --> 50:25.755
Saved 11 people before he died.

50:27.424 --> 50:29.592
Wow.

50:29.594 --> 50:32.228
You sacrificed once
for your country, Floyd.

50:32.230 --> 50:34.463
Do it again for your hometown.

50:34.465 --> 50:36.032
It needs you.

50:48.278 --> 50:50.546
What did she do in there?

50:50.548 --> 50:52.415
Fondle your balls?

50:52.417 --> 50:55.518
Oh, I'm sorry.
You must've fondled hers.

50:56.553 --> 50:58.754
Actually, we made out.

51:00.757 --> 51:02.725
Who's car is this?

51:02.727 --> 51:04.527
The mayor's,

51:04.529 --> 51:07.463
with whom we have
a rendezvous in 15 minutes.

51:07.465 --> 51:10.266
Hmm, no thanks.

51:10.268 --> 51:14.170
Come on. We both know you're
broke as a joke, sarn't.

51:17.140 --> 51:18.274
Get in.

51:26.850 --> 51:28.851
Great meal, monty, and again,

51:28.853 --> 51:31.353
thank you so much
for your support.

51:37.727 --> 51:40.863
Ah, so good to see you,
sergeant.

51:40.865 --> 51:44.467
Say, how would you like
a parade in your honor

51:44.469 --> 51:46.469
- straight through town?
- That's okay.

51:46.471 --> 51:50.106
No, too late. Jonathan here has
already been making plans.

51:50.108 --> 51:52.274
It's gonna be humongous.

51:52.276 --> 51:53.409
Mayor!

51:53.411 --> 51:55.878
Looking forward to unemployment?

51:55.880 --> 51:57.279
What... what was that?

51:57.281 --> 52:01.117
Suck some Chuck,
hag-fucker!

52:02.787 --> 52:05.154
Oh, Ted.
Move!

52:10.160 --> 52:13.229
I'm real sorry about the mess
in here, gentlemen.

52:15.499 --> 52:18.901
If you'll excuse me I have
a quick call to make.

52:18.903 --> 52:21.770
- Go ahead.

52:21.772 --> 52:23.739
Make yourselves a drink.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.712
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.914
Come on.
It's good stuff here.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.749
Maddox cannot find out
about this, you understand?

52:33.751 --> 52:35.284
There's things at work here,
at play.

52:35.286 --> 52:36.585
He won't find out.

52:36.587 --> 52:38.387
Yes he will, stu!
Then what?

52:38.389 --> 52:41.157
Drink, for god's sake.
You look like shit.

52:42.559 --> 52:44.627
Jesus, will you keep
your head screwed on?

52:44.629 --> 52:46.295
I'm telling we were
in Maddox's office.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.563
What?
No.

52:47.565 --> 52:49.832
- Don't do that, Floyd.
- Oh no?

52:49.834 --> 52:51.300
Who's running this outfit?

52:51.302 --> 52:53.235
Oh, don't fucking
pull rank with me.

52:53.237 --> 52:54.537
Mcmasters.

52:54.539 --> 52:57.740
Excellent work
earlier today, son.

52:57.742 --> 53:01.577
That reporter has been a real
heel for us, isn't that right?

53:01.579 --> 53:03.479
Oh, yeah.

53:03.481 --> 53:05.481
Splendid.
Splendid.

53:05.483 --> 53:07.349
Splendid.
So, Mr. mayor...

53:07.351 --> 53:08.684
We've already been
to see Maddox.

53:11.388 --> 53:13.822
- You... you what?
- Say again?

53:13.824 --> 53:16.458
We enjoyed coffee and eggs with
him in his office this morning.

53:16.460 --> 53:19.528
Boy, that was tasty bacon,
right, stu?

53:19.530 --> 53:21.897
Look, Mr. mayor,
like he said,

53:21.899 --> 53:25.768
we're just trying on
different drawers.

53:25.770 --> 53:28.804
- Drawers?
- What the hell is going on here?

53:28.806 --> 53:33.509
He showed us
some disturbing footage.

53:33.511 --> 53:35.544
- He's exhausted.
- I'm not believing this.

53:35.546 --> 53:36.645
Jonathan, are you
believing this?

53:36.647 --> 53:39.848
Cash.
On a big table.

53:39.850 --> 53:41.584
Oh, Jesus Christ.

53:42.619 --> 53:44.553
Get Andy in here now.

53:44.555 --> 53:45.754
Does Andy know how
to make a decent cocktail?

53:45.756 --> 53:47.957
Can we just talk
this over for a minute?

53:47.959 --> 53:52.361
No, tell me, how long have you been
colluding with that cryptofascist?

53:52.363 --> 53:54.083
You think you're gonna win
without this guy?

53:56.233 --> 53:57.433
Do you?

53:59.836 --> 54:05.341
That medal there is a symbol
of unbridled conquest,

54:05.343 --> 54:07.843
a freedom thrasher.

54:07.845 --> 54:11.247
And whoever holds it Tuesday
wins and you know it,

54:11.249 --> 54:13.349
so you'd better start
negotiating,

54:13.351 --> 54:16.518
or we'll throw ourselves
right back into the loving arms

54:16.520 --> 54:18.520
of Harry Maddox.

54:25.528 --> 54:27.930
Would you please fix me a drink?

54:31.769 --> 54:33.002
So what'll it be?

54:33.004 --> 54:34.436
- 20,000.
- What?

54:34.438 --> 54:36.272
- 50.
- 50?

54:36.274 --> 54:38.274
- You're absolutely sure.
- Jonathan, are you hearing this?

54:38.276 --> 54:39.575
New poll numbers, chief.

54:39.577 --> 54:41.644
It's a dead heat.

54:41.646 --> 54:44.513
- Fine, 50.
- 50? 50 what?

54:44.515 --> 54:46.315
- We'll take it.
- What the fuck just happened?

54:46.317 --> 54:47.616
- Pack an envelope.
- Ted!

54:47.618 --> 54:49.285
Just do it, Jonathan.

54:49.287 --> 54:51.620
Be sure it's legal sized.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.656
Right.
Legal.

54:54.691 --> 54:56.025
Drink up.

54:56.027 --> 54:57.593
We're going to the courthouse.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.428
Meet us outside in five.

55:05.402 --> 55:07.536
I ought to slap the shit
out of you, man.

55:07.538 --> 55:09.872
One stupid day and you can't
keep your shit together?

55:13.777 --> 55:15.711
- Yeah?
- Your hour starts now.

55:15.713 --> 55:18.414
- Go ahead.
- Meet me on the ninth floor

55:18.416 --> 55:19.982
of the courthouse in 20 minutes.

55:19.984 --> 55:22.584
The courthouse?

55:22.586 --> 55:24.787
- Why?
- Fuck you, why.

55:24.789 --> 55:27.022
Be there or the deal's off.

55:28.825 --> 55:31.727
- Shit.
- No bueno, sarn't.

55:31.729 --> 55:33.929
- What floor are we on?
- Three.

55:33.931 --> 55:35.731
I'm game.
You?

55:35.733 --> 55:36.832
Yeah.

55:37.867 --> 55:39.401
Come on.
We're late.

55:39.403 --> 55:41.570
- Where's the money?
- After we see the judge.

55:42.772 --> 55:44.473
Come on!

55:52.048 --> 55:54.049
It was a chaotic scene
this morning

55:54.051 --> 55:56.852
after a burglary
at mayor crump's office.

55:56.854 --> 55:58.921
An unidentified army sergeant,

55:58.923 --> 56:01.523
- reportedly the recipient of the
prestigious... - That's him!

56:01.525 --> 56:02.991
- Medal of victory...
- Real son of a bitch.

56:02.993 --> 56:05.461
Apprehended a suspect
before police arrived.

56:05.463 --> 56:07.730
- In other news, Afghanistan veteran
Paul Gerard... - Captain starke?

56:07.732 --> 56:09.598
- Was discovered dead in his vehicle...
- He's here.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.134
After an apparent crash
earlier this morning.

56:14.070 --> 56:16.138
This judge, parr is his name,

56:16.140 --> 56:18.040
he's a real war buff.

56:18.042 --> 56:19.842
- Where'd he serve?
- He didn't,

56:19.844 --> 56:22.878
and he picks
every election judge in town.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.581
However, I can't keep on carrying
you for the rest of my life,

56:25.583 --> 56:28.417
people say, "when is he
gonna get a real job?"

56:28.419 --> 56:30.552
Christ, you're an embarrassment.

56:30.554 --> 56:33.088
His man doesn't vote 'em.

56:33.090 --> 56:35.591
He counts 'em.

56:35.593 --> 56:36.992
And if the number's not right,

56:36.994 --> 56:39.728
he'll keep on counting
until it is.

56:41.564 --> 56:44.099
- How long do you think we'll be?
- How long?

56:44.101 --> 56:46.902
Look, just don't say anything
while we're in there, all right?

56:46.904 --> 56:48.103
Not a word.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.773
Stu, do you...
I don't know,

56:50.775 --> 56:53.542
- want to hang out down here?
- Hang out?

56:54.811 --> 56:57.746
Right.
'Course. Love to.

56:57.748 --> 57:00.916
- Good idea.
- Don't come upstairs at all.

57:23.606 --> 57:24.973
Where do you think you're going?

57:24.975 --> 57:26.575
But I thought
I was supposed to...

57:26.577 --> 57:28.510
- Stay with the fucking car.
- Scrub the rims.

57:32.649 --> 57:34.450
Nobody wins without the judge.

57:34.452 --> 57:36.785
He controls the election.

57:36.787 --> 57:39.054
Yeah, come in.

57:40.924 --> 57:42.524
Hello, judge.

57:42.526 --> 57:44.059
Sit down, make yourself a drink.

57:50.868 --> 57:52.468
Heard about your office, Ted.

57:52.470 --> 57:54.870
- Real shame.
- Don't I know it.

57:54.872 --> 57:57.473
My nephew's doing
elections this year.

57:59.709 --> 58:01.677
- Who's this?
- Judge, this is...

58:01.679 --> 58:03.011
Are you trying
to get me indicted?

58:03.013 --> 58:05.013
Do you want me to die
in a six by nine?

58:05.015 --> 58:08.684
Judge!
This is Floyd mcmasters.

58:08.686 --> 58:11.553
Winner of the medal of victory?

58:14.057 --> 58:15.891
Oh, yes!

58:15.893 --> 58:17.593
From the TV
earlier this morning!

58:17.595 --> 58:19.261
Son, I'm your biggest fan.

58:27.170 --> 58:29.905
There aren't any cameras
down that hallway.

58:31.174 --> 58:33.542
Well, maybe we should
go install one.

58:33.544 --> 58:35.744
It almost seems fake.

58:35.746 --> 58:39.815
On my life, judge,
it's completely genuine.

58:41.752 --> 58:42.752
Shit!

58:48.958 --> 58:51.927
It was only me alone
in that ditch, my friend.

58:51.929 --> 58:53.896
With my bolt action
thirty-ought-six

58:53.898 --> 58:56.098
and my shrapnel-filled
dead leg.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.933
And I felt a rumble,

58:57.935 --> 59:01.103
and over the Ridge 150 Taliban
fighters on horseback

59:01.105 --> 59:02.971
come thundering over the Ridge,

59:02.973 --> 59:05.641
- and just as I raised my gun...

59:06.843 --> 59:08.810
Finish your story, mcmasters.

59:08.812 --> 59:10.812
Could you excuse me
just one second, please?

59:14.951 --> 59:16.818
- Hello?
- It's me. Did he call yet?

59:16.820 --> 59:19.555
No, not yet. Look, I'm a
little tied up right now.

59:19.557 --> 59:20.997
Meet me at the
courthouse right away.

59:22.158 --> 59:23.792
Why?

59:23.794 --> 59:25.894
I need you to meet
someone with me, a judge.

59:25.896 --> 59:27.296
Where are you?

59:27.298 --> 59:28.797
Like, a minute away.

59:29.832 --> 59:31.133
I'll meet you there.

59:41.244 --> 59:42.844
Stop!

59:42.846 --> 59:44.880
- Don't go in there.
- Where's he at?

59:44.882 --> 59:47.082
I'm supposed to tell you
it's cancelled.

59:47.084 --> 59:49.051
The judge's wife, uh...

59:49.053 --> 59:51.320
She had, uh, a family...

59:51.322 --> 59:53.922
A birth!
In the family.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.257
I thought his wife was dead.

59:55.259 --> 59:56.825
That's what I meant.

59:56.827 --> 01:00:01.897
And here is my prized luger po8.

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:05.300
No telling how many bodies
are on this one.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:07.369
Tell Floyd to get
his ass up here.

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.039
Ah, well, now we can start the meeting.
Come in!

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.207
Start the meeting?

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:13.742
Wait! Don't...

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:15.677
Afternoon, your honor.

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:20.349
Excuse me, but we're discussing
official city business here.

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:21.650
What is this?

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:22.951
Please be seated.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.620
I don't sit down with thieves.

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:26.154
Thieves?
You're the thief!

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.724
Everyone, sit down.

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.034
Hey.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.170
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:54.182
You don't have
to tell me anything.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.018
Just take this tape

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.853
and listen to exactly
what I say.

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:02.257
Now, these have been prosperous
years, no doubt.

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:05.293
But it's time now
to rethink old models

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.863
and to look to the future.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.901
What is the deal, judge parr?

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:15.270
You both want the same thing,

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:17.039
you tell me.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.174
All right, judge.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:23.145
Seven percent salary increase
for next year.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:25.981
- Eight.
- Bastard. Nine, judge.

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:37.826
Where did you come from?

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:39.161
Right there. Looks like
they're closed, though.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:40.762
No, judge always stays
late for a drink.

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:43.231
Listen, he's got random
salary increases,

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:45.233
dodgy expense reports, and

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:48.303
he's appointed every election
judge since crump took office.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:50.238
- You don't say.
- Plus, he's a big war buff,

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.940
- so I need you.
- Can't we just do this tomorrow?

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.975
Thought you were
leaving tomorrow.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.149
You're right, I am.
Here we go.

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:03.118
Twenty, and...

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.087
An autographed letter

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:09.157
from general
George s. Patton himself.

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:12.127
Goodness me!

01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:14.830
This is gonna be
one tough decision.

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:16.298
Judge, you should be aware that

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.467
I've already secured
the endorsement

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:20.469
of medal of victory winner,

01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:22.504
Floyd mcmasters.

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:24.906
Wasn't he just here, Ted?

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.876
That's right judge, he was sitting
right there in that chair.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:33.148
Ma'am? The building's
closed for the day.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:35.183
- We gotta see the judge.
- Do you have an appointment?

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.885
I have a medal of victory winner

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:39.254
with whom the judge is eagerly
anticipating a meeting.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.522
He's already in a meeting.

01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:41.957
With who?

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.092
Well, why don't you ask him?

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.328
He came in with him,
rode up the elevator with him.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.765
Well, go on, ask him!

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.466
- Floyd?
- Um...

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:53.435
Where the hell were you?

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:54.770
I'll be right back.

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:57.339
What is she doing here?

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:58.701
This shit's over.
We have to abort.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.444
Tell me who's
in judge parr's office.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:05.380
- The mayor.
- And?

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:07.282
The other guy, Maddox.

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:14.456
Clyde.
Yeah, it's me.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.158
No, I'm out of jail.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160
Listen, get every reporter
you know

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.928
down at the courthouse
immediately.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.963
I'm not aborting this mission
and neither are you.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.431
You don't run this outfit.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:24.833
I never wanted to come back here
in the first place.

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:25.934
I hate this town, hate it!

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:27.536
Impossible, judge.

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:29.838
I don't know who this man
brought into your office,

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.807
but I can assure you
he was a fraud.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.508
Fraud? Ha!

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.812
Floyd mcmasters
is the most courageous citizen

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:38.380
this town has ever known.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.152
- Get off me!
- Listen!

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.454
You want to earn
that medal or what, soldier?

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:47.456
This medal...

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.091
Is a curse.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:07.943
Enough. Wendi, go get
mcmasters right now.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.069
Don't let that luger fall!

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:55.056
Judge parr?

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.627
Felix?

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.196
We have to...

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.201
We have to call an ambulance.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.437
Nobody's calling anybody.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.507
- What do you got?

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:14.175
This way, everyone.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:18.246
- We have to.
- He's dead, Floyd.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.447
Felix!

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:28.056
God damn
this sour-bellied town!

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:31.493
You're a malediction,
all of you!

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:35.630
Take my fucking money,
and run across town

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.532
to that gerontofile?

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:41.136
They called the press.

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:42.437
Son of a bitch.

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:47.509
Next time I see you, I'm gonna
put a bullet in your head.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:53.014
You understand? You're dead in
this town, mcmasters. Dead!

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.534
Floyd, we gotta move
out of here, now.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.138
Right through that door.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.978
What did you do?

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.312
Why did you kill the judge?

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.747
I didn't kill anybody.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.016
Wait.

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.422
- Holy Christ.
- Knock 'em out and drag 'em in.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:35.424
Wait.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:35.083
How much for a mow, Floyd?

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:43.658
Just gonna sit there with that
dumb look on your face, Princess?

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.728
- Start blasting, mcmasters!

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:56.171
Come on, mcmasters,
get your head out of your ass!

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:57.405
Shit, it's the captains.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.274
Act professional.

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:01.743
What do you think, captain?

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.745
Sweat balls, both of em!

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.564
Floyd, help me!

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:28.636
Posse comitatus, motherfuckers!

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.274
Stu?

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.477
Game over, game over.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:09:00.502
No!

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:07.774
Sergeant?

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.346
You got a visitor.

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:45.479
A soldier named Paul
gave it to me.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.816
And why would he do that?

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.854
He said he
didn't want it anymore.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:56.224
Wow.

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:57.692
So many lies.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.929
Look...

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:05.767
- I didn't mean to... -yeah,
you didn't mean to what?

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:08.870
You didn't mean to lie
about that medal?

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:11.272
That you're awol from the army?

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:13.741
That you're conspiring
to rig this election?

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:17.779
Which of those lies did you
not mean to tell, Floyd?

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:19.380
Look...

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:20.748
All I ever wanted
to do is send food

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.851
to starving kids in Malawi.

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:26.454
All I ever wanted to do
is feed the hungry.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.827
Is there something
wrong with that?

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:45.773
I'm glad you finally
came back, man.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:52.380
'Cause now I know how truly
fucking crazy you are.

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.401
I'm sorry.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.674
I never should have left you.

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.646
Not ever.

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.322
That's what you do, Floyd.

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:39.894
You run away.

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:52.707
Tell me where Maddox
has my bag, please.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.777
In his office safe.

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:57.812
Your tape, the camera,
it's all there.

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.883
What are you gonna do,
just walk in there?

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:09.023
Just worry about yourself, okay?

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.827
- Grady.
- What?

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:16.798
Your husband.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.033
How'd he fall?

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:24.839
He threw himself on a grenade.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.996
Friends...

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.399
In this vote-harvesting
season,

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:53.901
may I suggest something?

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.437
There is no left or right,

01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:59.140
no forward or backward,

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:04.579
only what we know
to be morally right.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.119
I keep telling them,

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:17.024
the only number for me
is 36-24-36.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.141
Man!

01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:35.877
- That felt phenomenal.
- That's it.

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:38.713
That's the number.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:42.016
- The what?
- For Maddox's office safe.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.085
- Did you get any sleep at all?
- Rayburn.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:46.687
I need to make a phone call.

01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:49.824
I'm trying to watch my stories and
you want to make a phone call now?

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:52.527
Yeah, now.
Can I use your cell phone?

01:13:52.529 --> 01:13:54.562
I don't even
know the... oh.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:14:00.468
- Fuck.
- Damn, damn, damn!

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:06.040
None of that, sheriff. Considering
all your small town handicaps,

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:08.943
most notably this idiot
fucking deputy you got here,

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.845
I'd say you've done
an exceptional job.

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:13.781
- My what?
- Now...

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.518
Gentlemen...

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.920
I need to make a phone call.

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:23.825
You are a wanted...

01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:25.493
I'm sorry, sheriff.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:27.495
Formerly wanted individual,

01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:32.133
who will be charged in both
military and civilian courts.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:36.003
Non-compliance
with procedural rules,

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:37.905
desertion,

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.842
leaving the scene of a crime,

01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:42.977
the murder of a beloved
public official

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:45.112
and stealing my fucking car!

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:50.084
There's no one to call.

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:52.820
I need a phone.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:55.022
Now.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:57.758
Where's the fucking medal,
Floyd?

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.494
He doesn't have it, shit bag.

01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:00.795
He got rid of it.

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.166
- This one?
- Fuck me.

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:08.269
Stealing off a dead man, huh?

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:10.605
Nothing sacred in your world,
is there, boys?

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:12.006
He gave it to me.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:15.209
You think I don't know
what happened?

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:18.012
Lance corporal Paul Gerard,

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.516
crashed his car about
five miles outside of town.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:24.519
You two idiots show up,
steal the medal

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:26.621
so you can pawn it off
as your own.

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:29.690
And then you let a soldier
die all by himself.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.893
- That's not true.
- Everything you are

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:34.729
spits on that medal.

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:36.097
Hand it over.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.269
It looks like you might just have
to come take it from me, sergeant.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:48.175
- Keys.
- Now wait just a goddamn...

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:51.078
Sheriff, this is my show.

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:58.653
Floyd, you have no idea
just how happy this is...

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.924
You been knocked out!

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:06.093
Put that gun on the table
and back the fuck up!

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:08.062
Now.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.634
Oh, no.

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:15.770
You're fucked for this,
mcmasters!

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.338
Completely and totally fucked!

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.006
I'm sorry.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:22.343
All I wanted to do was make
one goddamn phone call!

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:33.254
- Dammit.
- Oh, god, I gotta pee.

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.648
I'm sorry I hit you.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:03.184
I had it coming.

01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:05.086
Jesus...

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:07.822
You really pummeled that guy.

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:10.658
Who were you trying to call?

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:14.061
Grady.

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:17.198
So where we going
in this stolen police cruiser?

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.333
Maddox's office.

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:23.704
She needs the number.

01:17:23.706 --> 01:17:24.805
Yep.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.975
We're fucked.

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.761
- Oh, Jesus.
- -I got the number.

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:48.329
What the hell happened?

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:52.266
- 36, 24, 36.
- What?

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:55.936
For the safe.
Trust me.

01:17:55.938 --> 01:17:56.938
We're fucked.

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:02.276
Yes!

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.152
Hide.

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:25.166
All right, boys, find that footage
and don't be neat about it.

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:26.967
Oh, it's already gone.

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:32.473
Stop firing!

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:33.774
Drop it, big boy.

01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:35.009
Don't shoot us.

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:37.244
Oh, my god.

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:39.714
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:43.050
Christ, Ted.

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:45.486
You had no right
to steal that photo.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:48.155
Ted!

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.125
- Jonathan.
- Look.

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:52.860
- Where is it?
- -Oh, Ted.

01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:55.262
Oh, my god.

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:57.732
The stuff from the safe, where is it?
Hand it over.

01:18:57.734 --> 01:18:59.066
I got it.

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.316
And I'm taking it
right out that door.

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:05.039
Shoot him.

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:11.212
You ugly son of a...

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:17.785
Jesus.

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:19.053
Now we leave.

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.861
Tell me, mcmasters.

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:30.965
You still mowing lawns?

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:39.273
You're done.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.776
You were done the second
you threw us out on the street.

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:44.945
Done.

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:51.352
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:56.891
I haven't even started.

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.295
You, pistolero.

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.964
You're hired.

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:36.330
Aah, fuck me.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.900
Sarn't.

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.204
Hey!

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:56.851
How does it feel

01:20:56.853 --> 01:21:01.422
to turn into a broke,
delinquent liar,

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:03.324
like your old dad?

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.395
You know, some nights
when we were hungry,

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:13.868
I used to go to the bathroom
and lock the door,

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:19.139
drink enough water out of
the faucet till I was full.

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:24.645
So I could sleep.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:43.230
Time to go, sergeant.

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:12.960
Townville financial,

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:15.963
we're the currency
of contentment.

01:22:15.965 --> 01:22:17.464
But I need the services

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:20.668
of a decorated soldier
like yourself for one hour.

01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.703
And I'm willing to pay.

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:27.141
About $160 a minute.

01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:29.076
Who is this?

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:31.211
Good morning, Mr. Maddox.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:33.614
Susan, good morning.

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:35.215
I just wanted to let you know

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:36.550
that I won't be coming in
to work today

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:39.253
because I'm at the FBI.

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:45.292
- Susan?
- -Hello, Maddox.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:50.097
Why don't you grab a cup of
coffee and come down and see us?

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:53.300
Unless of course you'd like
to meet in your office?

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:07.715
You're driving.

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.688
Okay, I'll drive.

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:18.726
I'm staying.

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:24.665
You're way too serious
right now.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:26.533
Come on, get in the car.

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:32.039
Come on, man.

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:36.543
Get in the car, me and you, in
this car, driving out of here.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.546
Not this time.

01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:00.667
Always a pleasure.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.105
Yeah.

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.052
Yeah.

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.325
Hey, mcmasters.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:29.263
Figured you'd want it.

01:24:29.265 --> 01:24:31.265
For luck.

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:38.105
Luck I got.

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:55.589
- Oh! Whew!

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:58.158
You gotta love
sour apple liqueur.

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.120
Get in.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:57.351
- Floyd, this is my son, Jake.
- Hello.

01:25:57.353 --> 01:25:59.186
Hello.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:00.487
What's wrong with your leg?

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:03.824
Got shot.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:06.426
You need a lift somewhere?

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:09.796
Where you going?

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:16.570
Hold it right there.

01:26:16.572 --> 01:26:18.472
Hey, watch yourselves.

01:26:18.474 --> 01:26:20.307
We've got a fifth grader
right here.

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:25.646
- Dammit.
- You forget your cuffs again, sheriff?

01:26:25.648 --> 01:26:27.581
Just... restrain him.

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:31.885
Be careful, walls.

01:26:31.887 --> 01:26:34.354
This man is not
who he claims to be.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:35.522
Oh, really?

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:37.391
Rayburn, take him downtown.

01:26:37.393 --> 01:26:38.892
You got it, sheriff.

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.696
What's he charged with?

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.231
Excuse me?

01:26:44.233 --> 01:26:46.833
Go ahead.
I'm listening.

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:03.450
Beautiful morning,
ain't it, sergeant?
