WEBVTT

00:19.607 --> 00:22.507
Thank you
for seeing me, Father.

00:26.540 --> 00:27.907
I need help.

00:28.007 --> 00:29.373
And I don't have anyone
to talk to,

00:29.473 --> 00:30.707
and I need to talk.

00:30.807 --> 00:33.140
If I just go over things
in my mind, I...

00:34.473 --> 00:36.373
I... I get lost and I...

00:37.373 --> 00:38.873
We all get a little lost.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.907
Jesus, I don't mean like that,
I mean lost.

00:42.007 --> 00:43.773
Like I literally can't tell
the difference

00:43.873 --> 00:45.907
between what's real
and what's not.

00:46.007 --> 00:49.073
Somehow,
talking out loud helps.

00:50.273 --> 00:52.440
I haven't slept
for a few days.

00:54.973 --> 00:57.007
Probably not making
any sense, I just...

00:59.507 --> 01:02.240
This time, there may have been
too many possibilities,

01:02.340 --> 01:04.940
too many motivations. I...

01:08.073 --> 01:09.940
I had a friend that...

01:11.773 --> 01:13.707
...he used to help me
get through times like this.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.340
- But he died.
- I'm very sorry.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.907
Is there anyone else
you're close to?

01:21.840 --> 01:23.840
In my line of work,

01:23.940 --> 01:26.307
it's best not to get close
to anyone.

01:26.407 --> 01:28.173
That sounds lonely.

01:31.507 --> 01:32.707
Look, I didn't come here

01:32.807 --> 01:34.240
for some kind of counsel
or salvation

01:34.340 --> 01:37.440
or Hail Marys
or whatever it is you do here.

01:39.107 --> 01:41.173
I just need someone to listen.

01:42.572 --> 01:44.207
Do you think you can do that,
Father?

01:44.307 --> 01:45.940
Do you think
you can listen to me

01:46.040 --> 01:47.840
and keep it between us?

01:47.940 --> 01:50.040
Just us and God.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.707
God.

01:52.807 --> 01:54.273
Right.

01:54.373 --> 01:56.606
Well, maybe he can tell me
what the fuck is going on.

02:22.140 --> 02:23.873
The only way to make real money

02:23.973 --> 02:25.707
is to take big positions
and move fast.

02:25.707 --> 02:28.506
Hey, is that Strapstetter,
from the Fed?

02:28.606 --> 02:30.273
Yes, it is.

02:30.373 --> 02:31.973
But that's not
Mrs. Strapstetter.

02:32.073 --> 02:34.539
No.

02:39.207 --> 02:40.973
Guy's got a laugh
like a warthog.

02:41.073 --> 02:43.807
Terrible taste in wine, too.

02:43.907 --> 02:45.173
<i>WOMAN [on TV]:

02:45.273 --> 02:48.373

02:49.173 --> 02:50.707
Jacob, right?

02:51.807 --> 02:53.840
Would you mind changing
the channel for me?

02:53.940 --> 02:56.840
- Yes, sir, Mr...
- Weir.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.073
- Yes, sir, Mr. Weir.
- Thank you.

03:16.740 --> 03:18.707
Damn it.

03:18.707 --> 03:20.340
Hey,
change the fucking channel.

03:21.472 --> 03:24.207
CNNBC, Fox Business,
Bloomberg, something.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.773
Change the fucking channel.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.140
I'm sorry, Mr. Merril.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.707
Mr. Weir's watching the game.

03:29.807 --> 03:31.373
It's fucking soccer, dude.

03:31.472 --> 03:32.606
Spoiler,
it's going to be 0-0

03:32.707 --> 03:34.707
for the next
four fucking hours.

03:34.707 --> 03:36.073
Change the fucking channel.

03:36.173 --> 03:37.707
Hey, it's my team, pal.

03:37.707 --> 03:41.439
Yeah? I'll, uh, I'll give you
five grand, how's that?

03:45.840 --> 03:47.439
You know what? Keep it.
Knock yourself out.

03:47.539 --> 03:49.173
Jacob, it's fine,
change the channel.

03:49.273 --> 03:50.807
Yes, sir, Mr. Weir.

03:50.907 --> 03:54.373

04:07.506 --> 04:08.073
I'm not asking for strategy.

04:08.173 --> 04:09.707
Do it now!

04:10.572 --> 04:12.572
<i>I will be
contacting my doctor.</i>

04:12.707 --> 04:15.840
Wow.
He really doesn't like soccer.

04:15.940 --> 04:17.973
Yeah.

04:18.073 --> 04:19.873
But he makes up for it
with charm.

04:25.707 --> 04:26.773
Hailey.

04:26.873 --> 04:28.707
John.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.372
Maybe the funniest thing
I've seen in five years.

04:34.472 --> 04:37.040
Right, like, all three.

04:40.173 --> 04:41.439
Where you been hiding, Hailey?

04:41.539 --> 04:43.773
I haven't seen you
around here before.

04:43.873 --> 04:46.040
That's because
I haven't been here before,

04:46.140 --> 04:47.873
- John.
- Ah.

04:47.973 --> 04:49.506
How about you?

04:49.606 --> 04:51.572
Oh, I come here all the time.

04:51.707 --> 04:52.873
Can't get enough

04:52.973 --> 04:54.707
of the bloody cow carcass,
wall-street-bro vibe.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.273
No, I'm kidding.

04:57.372 --> 04:59.073
It's my first time, too.

05:01.439 --> 05:04.572
So, what brought you
into this fine establishment?

05:04.707 --> 05:07.273
I'm in from Pittsburgh
for some meetings.

05:07.372 --> 05:09.406
Had some time to kill,

05:09.506 --> 05:11.840
figured I'd have some wine,

05:11.940 --> 05:13.439
you know...

05:13.539 --> 05:16.572
troll the dating apps
for a little fun.

05:17.506 --> 05:19.140
You know,
make the most of things.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.007
And then I look up
and I see...

05:23.107 --> 05:24.973
you.

05:25.073 --> 05:26.973
- And, well...
- Here we are.

05:27.073 --> 05:29.506
So it seems.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.372
My hotel's across the street.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.707
Well, that's convenient.

05:41.406 --> 05:43.339
I hope you have
a good night's sleep.

05:43.439 --> 05:44.973
Oh, wait a second.

05:45.073 --> 05:46.207
I see what you're saying.

05:46.306 --> 05:48.140
Okay, just this once.
Bartender!

05:48.240 --> 05:49.539
Could you please
bring me the bill

05:49.707 --> 05:51.306
as fast as humanly possible?

05:52.306 --> 05:54.173

06:10.807 --> 06:12.040
Are you leaving so soon?

06:12.140 --> 06:13.907
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.572
Afraid so.

06:15.707 --> 06:17.907
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

06:23.807 --> 06:25.240
What are you doing?

06:25.339 --> 06:26.539
You're going to have
to tell Madi

06:26.707 --> 06:28.173
if she wants to get
leverage over me

06:28.272 --> 06:30.007
she's going to have to work
a little harder.

06:30.107 --> 06:31.339
Huh?

06:32.572 --> 06:34.372
- What the fuck?
- Besides, the job's over.

06:34.472 --> 06:36.707
The money's already
been transferred.

06:37.707 --> 06:38.907
Bingo.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.406
Is that a camera?

06:41.173 --> 06:42.773
What the fuck
is going on here?

06:42.873 --> 06:44.572
Blackmail will not work.

06:44.707 --> 06:46.073
And if Madi was as smart
as she thinks she is,

06:46.173 --> 06:48.539
she'd know that my marriage
was over years ago.

06:48.707 --> 06:50.773
Whoa, look, I...
I don't have any goddamn idea

06:50.873 --> 06:52.840
- what you are talking about.
- Look.

06:52.940 --> 06:55.506
You know, I get it,
it's her business. I'm cool.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.239
What... what's our business?

06:57.339 --> 06:58.907
Look, I was just looking
to get laid.

06:59.007 --> 07:02.940
I'm... I'm not into any weird
fantasy voyeur cosplay shit

07:03.040 --> 07:04.840
or whatever the hell
this whole thing is.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.406
Wow, you are terrific.

07:07.506 --> 07:08.707
You need to leave.

07:08.707 --> 07:10.272
I've done
the Krav Maga workout.

07:10.372 --> 07:12.173
I could break your neck
if I needed to,

07:12.272 --> 07:13.873
- do you understand?
- I do.

07:13.973 --> 07:15.406
And I am leaving.

07:15.506 --> 07:17.506
Hailey, it has been
a pleasure meeting you.

07:17.606 --> 07:20.007
And I hope you have
a wonderful day.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.206
What the hell is happening?

07:21.306 --> 07:23.073
Hey, asshole!

07:23.873 --> 07:26.173
If you really thought
I was blackmailing you,

07:26.272 --> 07:28.140
why'd you sleep with me?

07:28.239 --> 07:30.040
You're kidding, right?

07:58.372 --> 08:00.940
How long have you
been following me?

08:22.239 --> 08:23.707
Morning, Weir. Got a minute?

08:23.707 --> 08:26.506
Agent Jo Madi.
Always a pleasure.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.139
- I need a word.
- Sure.

08:31.073 --> 08:32.306
That your new partner?

08:32.406 --> 08:33.472
- She joining us?
- Okay.

08:33.572 --> 08:34.907
Don't start with me, Weir.

08:35.007 --> 08:36.707
My daughter got herself
kicked out of school

08:36.807 --> 08:38.707
and now I'm stuck with her
until my wife can figure out

08:38.807 --> 08:40.272
someplace else to put her.

08:40.372 --> 08:42.339
Hey, thanks for the present.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.439
Uh...

08:44.539 --> 08:46.707
You know, you should have
just planted drugs.

08:46.707 --> 08:49.372
A video of me having sex
with a beautiful woman

08:49.472 --> 08:51.506
will just get me a date
at my age.

08:51.606 --> 08:53.040
- What?
- By the way,

08:53.139 --> 08:54.840
the tail that you put on me?

08:54.940 --> 08:57.707
- Mall-cop-level bad.
- Mm. Okay.

08:57.707 --> 09:00.239
You're paranoid and
it's actually worse than usual.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.406
- So...
- Occupational hazard.

09:02.506 --> 09:03.907
So, how are you
and the fine folks

09:04.007 --> 09:05.973
down at the FBI Financial
Crimes Unit doing today?

09:06.073 --> 09:09.539
Well, we are extremely busy,
thanks to you.

09:09.707 --> 09:11.773
What's that supposed to mean?

09:11.873 --> 09:15.040
Barry Merril, the very
pissed-off hedge fund manager

09:15.139 --> 09:18.239
over at BlackTerra, called me
after the bell this morning.

09:18.339 --> 09:20.840
Seems he got wind of a rumor

09:20.940 --> 09:23.873
of Esper-Ethika's stock
tanking in Tokyo,

09:23.973 --> 09:26.306
<i>and he sold off
his entire stake.</i>

09:26.406 --> 09:28.707
Our whole position.

09:28.707 --> 09:30.907
Wow. That sounds rough.

09:31.007 --> 09:32.306
He get out okay?

09:32.406 --> 09:35.040
Mm, there was no sell-off
in Tokyo.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.707
In fact, he was
the first one to sell.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.840
And in the rush,
the stock cratered

09:39.940 --> 09:43.040
and KOT Capital was there
to scoop it up at a discount.

09:43.139 --> 09:45.339
Are you accusing me
of something, Jo?

09:45.439 --> 09:47.807
KOT Capital is your client.

09:47.907 --> 09:49.272
I don't talk about my clients.

09:49.372 --> 09:51.606
Are you accusing me
of something?

09:54.106 --> 09:57.472
Merril said he saw a woman
talking to Strapstetter

09:57.572 --> 10:00.040
from the Fed last night.

10:01.239 --> 10:02.572
I'm sorry to intrude,

10:02.673 --> 10:04.372
but I hate to see
such an important man...

10:04.472 --> 10:06.740
<i>A few minutes later,
she sits down at the table</i>

10:06.840 --> 10:08.472
<i>next to his
and starts telling her date</i>

10:08.572 --> 10:10.707
<i>about the tip she got
from her "good friend,"</i>

10:10.807 --> 10:12.506
<i>Alan Strapstetter.</i>

10:12.606 --> 10:15.673
Esper-Ethika's boner medication
causes cancer.

10:15.773 --> 10:17.439
<i>A report's about to come out.</i>

10:17.539 --> 10:19.206
<i>A few minutes later, he gets</i>

10:19.306 --> 10:20.873
<i>a text from his intel people.</i>

10:20.973 --> 10:22.372
<i>It says, "It's an emergency.</i>

10:22.472 --> 10:23.807
<i>Turn on the news."</i>

10:23.907 --> 10:26.907
- So he does.
- Change the fucking channel.

10:27.007 --> 10:28.506
But there was no report.

10:28.606 --> 10:31.539
And there was no broadcast
about it, either,

10:31.639 --> 10:32.707
according to the networks.

10:32.807 --> 10:34.406
<i>Jacob, right?</i>

10:35.006 --> 10:37.172
Do you mind changing
the channel for me?

10:37.272 --> 10:39.506
- Yes, sir, Mr...
- Weir.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.707
Yes, sir, Mr. Weir.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.740
<i>Not a real one, at least.</i>

10:43.840 --> 10:46.639
<i>It's sent Esper-Ethika's stock
into freefall.</i>

10:46.740 --> 10:49.272
Close on Esper and lock it.

10:49.372 --> 10:50.773
Our whole position.

10:50.873 --> 10:52.439
<i>But either way,
it prompted him</i>

10:52.539 --> 10:54.840
<i>to sell and tank the price,</i>

10:54.940 --> 10:57.072
<i>so your client
could make a buck.</i>

10:57.172 --> 10:58.740
Well...

10:58.840 --> 11:00.339
that's a fascinating story.

11:00.439 --> 11:02.740
But I'm sorry,
I have no earthly idea

11:02.840 --> 11:04.439
what you are talking about.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.707
Good morning, everyone.

11:05.807 --> 11:07.539
- Morning, boss.
- Late night, Cara?

11:07.707 --> 11:08.807
I'm not complaining.

11:08.907 --> 11:10.139
Conference room
in five minutes.

11:10.239 --> 11:12.773
Corporate espionage is
a dirty way to get rich.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.707
Espionage?
What are you talking about?

11:14.707 --> 11:16.840
- I'm not a spy.
- Uh, manipulating people

11:16.940 --> 11:19.707
and situations to influence
markets for client advantage

11:19.707 --> 11:21.506
is... what, then?

11:21.606 --> 11:23.539
Consulting.
Which is not illegal.

11:23.707 --> 11:24.972
And, hey, you and I both know,

11:25.072 --> 11:27.172
whatever these assholes lose
on Wall Street,

11:27.272 --> 11:28.506
they make right back.

11:28.606 --> 11:30.439
So forgive me
my lack of shame.

11:30.539 --> 11:32.006
Who's Tom?

11:32.873 --> 11:35.106
- I don't know. Who's tom?
- Oh.

11:35.206 --> 11:36.840
You're surprised
that I heard about him.

11:36.940 --> 11:38.439
Yeah, it sounds like
a big job.

11:38.539 --> 11:40.539
Listen, I got ears
all over this town.

11:40.707 --> 11:42.539
Again, no idea
what you're talking about.

11:42.707 --> 11:43.972
You'll have to excuse me.

11:44.072 --> 11:47.039
I'm very busy doing
anything other than this.

11:49.807 --> 11:52.840
Hello. Can I get you
a cup of coffee or something?

11:52.939 --> 11:55.740
- Shut the fuck up.
- Okay.

12:01.506 --> 12:02.606
Guess that's my jam.

12:02.707 --> 12:03.907
Hey, boss.

12:04.006 --> 12:05.439
What if Madi talks
to the bartender?

12:05.539 --> 12:07.239
I told the bartender
I had a video of him

12:07.339 --> 12:08.773
stealing from the till.

12:08.873 --> 12:10.306
As long as he kept his mouth
shut and played along,

12:10.406 --> 12:11.406
I wouldn't show anyone.

12:11.506 --> 12:13.039
But how'd you know that?

12:13.139 --> 12:14.773
I didn't. But don't
all bartenders do that?

12:16.172 --> 12:17.707
Great job, everybody.

12:17.707 --> 12:19.472
Only here for the food, boss.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.106
Oh. Then it's on me.
Wait, what?

12:22.206 --> 12:24.206
Did you just offer
to pay for something?

12:24.306 --> 12:25.506
I think he did.

12:25.606 --> 12:27.006
The same guy who makes me pay

12:27.106 --> 12:28.372
for booze at business meals.

12:28.472 --> 12:29.840
Hey, that's a standard
industry practice.

12:29.939 --> 12:31.840
Says the guy who installed

12:31.939 --> 12:33.707
the coin-operated
coffee machine.

12:33.707 --> 12:35.006
Okay, listen up, children.

12:35.106 --> 12:36.239
A little overhead
is the key to success,

12:36.339 --> 12:37.873
and besides,
the creamer is free.

12:37.972 --> 12:40.206
You give homeless people change
and ask for a receipt.

12:40.306 --> 12:41.972
WEIR [laughing]:
That's not true.

12:42.072 --> 12:43.972
But I probably would
if I could.

12:44.072 --> 12:45.072
Eh, we're just busting balls.

12:45.172 --> 12:46.172
Do whatever you want

12:46.272 --> 12:47.439
with your giant piles of money.

12:47.539 --> 12:51.139
But, you know,
thank you for this.

12:51.239 --> 12:52.707
Until the next one.

12:52.807 --> 12:54.072
Tom's coming up.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.372
To Tom.

12:55.472 --> 12:57.707
- To Tom!
- Who's Tom?

12:57.807 --> 12:59.539
You're gonna love him.

13:53.872 --> 13:55.472

14:23.707 --> 14:25.472
Way to go, Sammy!

14:32.139 --> 14:33.972
<i>Well,
that was quite the performance.</i>

14:34.072 --> 14:35.972
<i>I thought it was.</i>

14:36.072 --> 14:38.539
It doesn't hurt to look like

14:38.707 --> 14:40.707
successful co-parents
every once in a while.

14:40.707 --> 14:42.306
Yep.

14:43.206 --> 14:45.206
It's good you came.

14:48.372 --> 14:50.740
I got a meeting
with Valence tomorrow.

14:52.206 --> 14:53.740
About time.

14:58.206 --> 15:00.806
You think
I should talk to him?

15:00.906 --> 15:02.206
Just... no.

15:02.306 --> 15:04.506
Not while he's with his friends.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.606
He really hated you that much?

15:08.707 --> 15:11.906
I mean, the kid's 14.
He hates everything.

15:12.839 --> 15:16.106
But, you know, he blames me
for most of it, so...

15:16.206 --> 15:17.606
don't take it personally.

15:18.572 --> 15:20.472
That's just the job.

15:21.239 --> 15:23.739
Hopefully, not forever.

15:30.739 --> 15:32.707
How about you? You doing okay?

15:32.806 --> 15:34.206
You look...

15:34.306 --> 15:36.806
Hmm. Tired? Stressed?

15:36.906 --> 15:38.839
Like shit?

15:40.506 --> 15:42.872
Well, no, I wouldn't say that.

15:48.206 --> 15:50.406
Want to talk about it?

15:50.506 --> 15:52.206
Nothing to talk about.

15:52.306 --> 15:54.106
I'm good.

15:54.206 --> 15:55.706
Right.

15:56.472 --> 15:59.872
Well, I think
I'm gonna get going.

16:01.239 --> 16:03.239
Say hi to everyone
at the office?

16:03.339 --> 16:05.072
- I will.
- And...

16:06.106 --> 16:07.706
...thanks for coming, daddy-o.

16:07.706 --> 16:09.772
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.839
Sam?

16:13.939 --> 16:15.606
Let's go.

16:34.972 --> 16:36.706
<i>...multiple protests

16:36.706 --> 16:38.139
... <i>as the Shared Data Act</i>

<i>But the sponsor of the bill,</i>

16:41.706 --> 16:43.106

16:43.206 --> 16:45.172

16:48.506 --> 16:50.039
<i>Privacy advocates are
against the bill,</i>

16:50.139 --> 16:51.272
<i>saying there's too much power...</i>

16:52.439 --> 16:53.706
<i>...in the hands of private</i>

17:00.972 --> 17:04.406

17:18.006 --> 17:19.406
Get out.

18:02.339 --> 18:05.571
<i>ANNOUNCER [over P.A.]:

<i>and put a bullet

18:28.106 --> 18:29.739
And then he texted

18:29.839 --> 18:32.006
a picture of it to his wife.

18:32.106 --> 18:33.739
God knows why.

18:33.839 --> 18:35.306
Ultimately, there was nothing
to be done about it.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.106
Untouchable, hmm?

18:37.206 --> 18:38.939
Yeah, but we still got paid.

18:39.039 --> 18:40.139
We always got paid.

18:40.239 --> 18:42.272
Whether we deserved it or not.

18:44.072 --> 18:46.006
I'm sorry, I have to ask:

18:46.106 --> 18:50.072
Is it true that you hit
Bob Tanaka at Softbank?

18:50.172 --> 18:51.739
I mean, your name is
mentioned sometimes.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.172
You really expect him
to answer that, Xander?

18:53.272 --> 18:55.139
"No comment," John.
Just say, "No comment."

18:55.239 --> 18:58.706
All I'll say is that
I like making rich assholes

18:58.706 --> 19:00.906
pay me to make
other rich assholes lose money.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.906
Amen to that.

19:04.006 --> 19:07.772
Though, I will say that Tanaka
is just the sort of guy

19:07.872 --> 19:09.972
that John loves to take down.

19:10.072 --> 19:13.706
God, it's so good to see you.
It's been too long, huh?

19:15.072 --> 19:16.306
Yeah, it has.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.272
But...

19:18.372 --> 19:19.472
I can see that

19:19.571 --> 19:21.706
you're doing pretty well
without me.

19:21.706 --> 19:23.872
It's true,
partner. It's true.

19:23.972 --> 19:27.339
I mean, government contracts,
ad agencies, they just...

19:27.439 --> 19:28.972
they pay a whole lot better

19:29.072 --> 19:30.839
than grinding out an edge
on trades like we used to do.

19:30.939 --> 19:34.372
You got out
when the stayin' was good, John.

19:35.906 --> 19:37.872
You know, last year
we out-billed Palantir?

19:37.972 --> 19:38.972
Wow.

19:39.072 --> 19:41.139
That's incredible.
Right?

19:41.239 --> 19:44.339
If you had any idea
how much the NYPD

19:44.439 --> 19:48.406
is paying us to process all
of their data? I mean, it's...

19:48.505 --> 19:49.972
I mean, I know, I know.

19:50.072 --> 19:51.406
It's not about the money
with you. I know that.

19:51.505 --> 19:52.906
Never mind.

19:53.706 --> 19:56.706
Let me show you
what we're up to.

19:57.505 --> 19:59.239
Great.

20:00.072 --> 20:02.006
<i>Data drives everything.</i>

20:02.106 --> 20:04.072
It's the biggest commodity
there is

20:04.172 --> 20:05.806
in private intelligence.

20:05.906 --> 20:07.438
I mean, big players
in every industry,

20:07.538 --> 20:12.605
not just the financial guys,
they are drowning in data.

20:13.739 --> 20:15.406
And that's where we come in.

20:16.206 --> 20:19.272
We just sort of
make sense of it all.

20:20.172 --> 20:23.672
Of course, you saw this coming
long before anyone else did.

20:23.772 --> 20:26.372
You should be here
working with me right now.

20:26.471 --> 20:27.739
Thanks, but no thanks.

20:27.839 --> 20:29.538
I like my little pond.

20:29.638 --> 20:31.538
All right.
With the right data,

20:31.638 --> 20:34.839
we can predict things
that even you would not believe.

20:34.939 --> 20:36.172
Like Amazon?

20:36.272 --> 20:38.272
Hmm? They can correlate
someone's shopping history

20:38.372 --> 20:39.605
and they will know exactly

20:39.706 --> 20:42.206
what that person's going
to buy next and when.

20:42.306 --> 20:44.039
Cool.

20:44.139 --> 20:45.939
You think
you're shopping for socks,

20:46.039 --> 20:48.405
but they know
who you're voting for and why.

20:48.505 --> 20:50.739
Have a seat.

20:51.739 --> 20:53.471
Is this real?

20:54.306 --> 20:55.605
Seventh century.

20:55.706 --> 20:57.605
BCE, of course.

20:57.706 --> 20:59.906
Wow.

21:00.006 --> 21:01.571
So where do you go these days

21:01.706 --> 21:03.739
to get a 2,800-year-old
Gilgamesh tablet?

21:03.839 --> 21:06.706
That's a secret.

21:06.706 --> 21:08.772
But it doesn't come cheap.

21:08.872 --> 21:10.306
Why? You want one?

21:10.405 --> 21:11.706
'Cause I got a guy.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.772
Why am I here, Miles?

21:15.538 --> 21:17.371
I need you.

21:17.471 --> 21:18.706
It's a simple job.

21:18.706 --> 21:20.206
Old-school,
flesh-and-blood gig,

21:20.306 --> 21:21.605
the way you like it.

21:21.706 --> 21:23.505
You got a full team here
in-house.

21:23.605 --> 21:25.172
- Why me?
- Listen.

21:25.272 --> 21:27.605
My guys are good
with ones and zeroes,

21:27.706 --> 21:30.839
but they're not what
you'd call "hands-on."

21:30.939 --> 21:32.172
And I haven't got
my hands dirty in years.

21:32.272 --> 21:33.706
I'm just a suit now.

21:33.806 --> 21:36.106
I'm sticking to my pond, too.

21:36.972 --> 21:39.306
I'd rather farm it out,
have it done right.

21:40.405 --> 21:43.139
I also know I can trust you.
Hmm, careful now.

21:44.072 --> 21:46.739
You're the one who taught me
not to trust anybody.

21:47.772 --> 21:49.239
Fair enough.

21:52.306 --> 21:53.772
The simple fact is that

21:53.872 --> 21:56.006
the client,
who will remain nameless,

21:56.106 --> 21:58.872
would like an added layer
of distance from this one.

21:58.972 --> 22:00.706
And he's willing to pay extra.

22:00.706 --> 22:02.006
How dirty?

22:02.106 --> 22:04.338
Nothing you haven't
done before.

22:04.438 --> 22:06.772
Hear the pitch?

22:08.605 --> 22:10.206
Yeah, let's do it.

22:11.272 --> 22:12.371
Good.

22:12.471 --> 22:14.006
Here's all the intel.

22:37.605 --> 22:39.006
Come on.

22:39.839 --> 22:41.305
Uh, shift change.

22:41.405 --> 22:43.305
Maybe get an Uber instead.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.906
Oh, right, you can't.

22:46.006 --> 22:47.605
Because you only have
burner phones,

22:47.706 --> 22:48.906
no credit cards.

22:49.006 --> 22:50.438
Yeah, that's not suspicious
at all.

22:50.538 --> 22:52.872
Well, slap me silly
and call me old-fashioned.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.906
I guess I just prefer cash.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.772
Hey, where's Agent Eilish?

22:56.872 --> 22:59.305
Uh, therapy. Thank God.

22:59.405 --> 23:00.739
Look, I know you think

23:00.839 --> 23:02.939
that you're Robin Hood,
but you're not.

23:03.039 --> 23:05.206
And messing with Valence
isn't worth the risk.

23:06.106 --> 23:08.239
Wow. Jo.

23:08.338 --> 23:09.839
Way to look out.

23:11.206 --> 23:13.139
Those guys
that you got following me?

23:13.239 --> 23:14.872
Tell them I'm heading back
to the office

23:14.972 --> 23:16.538
if they want to get
a good parking space

23:16.706 --> 23:18.172
before I get there.

23:19.438 --> 23:20.739
Hey, that paranoia,

23:20.839 --> 23:22.872
it's gonna trip you up
one day, Weir.

23:22.972 --> 23:26.039
Have a good afternoon,
Special Agent Madi.

23:30.706 --> 23:31.471
This'll be a simple op.

23:31.571 --> 23:32.605
I want to do a variation

23:32.706 --> 23:33.872
on the Odd Couple job
that we did on Benchmark

23:33.972 --> 23:34.972
a few years ago.

23:35.072 --> 23:36.706
Do we have time
for another job?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.238
We've got Tom coming up.

23:38.338 --> 23:40.172
Tom can wait.
We're gonna do this one first.

23:40.271 --> 23:43.505
Can we send the, uh, task monkey
for some Thai?

23:43.605 --> 23:44.839
Please don't call me that.

23:44.939 --> 23:47.072
Okay, Kyle. Sorry, Kyle.
I'm just hungry, Kyle.

23:47.172 --> 23:49.006
Okay, stop picking
on the intern.

23:49.106 --> 23:51.238
Pay attention.
You're gonna be graded.

23:51.338 --> 23:54.972
Okay.
Luxbrant is a huge player

23:55.072 --> 23:56.505
in the luxury brand market.

23:56.605 --> 23:58.338
They own a ton
of high-end labels,

23:58.438 --> 24:00.271
everything from
clothing to furniture.

24:00.371 --> 24:01.906
Recently,
there have been rumors,

24:02.006 --> 24:04.906
loud rumors, that they have
been using child labor,

24:05.006 --> 24:06.438
which triggered an investigation

24:06.538 --> 24:08.338
into their finances by
the Treasury Department.

24:08.438 --> 24:10.605
Now, Luxbrant claims
that the allegations

24:10.706 --> 24:12.605
and the investigation
have been engineered

24:12.706 --> 24:15.238
by one of their competitors,
the Banomar Group,

24:15.338 --> 24:16.806
in an effort
to tank their stocks

24:16.906 --> 24:18.271
so the Banomar Group
can swoop in

24:18.371 --> 24:20.106
and pick them up on the cheap.

24:20.205 --> 24:22.371
That just simply is not true.

24:22.471 --> 24:24.405
But Luxbrant needs it
to be true

24:24.505 --> 24:26.405
in order to make
this investigation go away.

24:26.505 --> 24:29.706
So... pretty simple, right?
All we need to do is

24:29.706 --> 24:31.039
suggest that the Banomar Group

24:31.139 --> 24:32.305
and the Treasury Department investigator

24:32.405 --> 24:34.006
are somehow in bed together.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.438
Nothing tawdry,

24:35.538 --> 24:37.872
just a few photographs
to feed the narrative

24:37.972 --> 24:39.338
and squash the investigation.

24:39.438 --> 24:41.605
For that, we get
three percent of the buy price

24:41.706 --> 24:43.438
to split with Arda.

24:43.538 --> 24:45.171
And what's the ballpark
on that?

24:45.271 --> 24:46.605
I'll give you
some perspective.

24:46.706 --> 24:48.939
A few years ago,
Michael Kors bought Versace

24:49.039 --> 24:50.371
for $2 billion.

24:50.471 --> 24:52.906
This will be like buying
ten Versaces.

24:53.006 --> 24:54.906
Do the math.

24:55.006 --> 24:56.972
Who needs to be seen with who?

24:57.072 --> 24:58.972
This is Dana Heinrich.

24:59.072 --> 25:00.806
She is the CEO of
the Banomar Group,

25:00.906 --> 25:02.205
and this is Edward Homm,

25:02.305 --> 25:03.405
the Treasury Department investigator.

25:03.505 --> 25:05.006
They do not know each other.

25:05.106 --> 25:07.538
They have never met before
and most likely never would.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.405
It's our job to make sure that
they do and get it on camera.

25:10.505 --> 25:13.471
Mr. Homm has been visiting
from Washington D.C.

25:13.571 --> 25:15.806
He spends most of his time
shuttling back and forth

25:15.906 --> 25:17.939
<i>between the Treasury
Department offices</i>

25:18.039 --> 25:19.972
<i>and the Kettering Hotel
in Midtown.</i>

25:20.072 --> 25:21.772
Ms. Heinrich, meanwhile,
on the West Side,

25:21.872 --> 25:23.739
<i>leaves Westchester
at 7:00 a.m.,</i>

25:23.839 --> 25:25.405
<i>takes the West Side Highway
to her office</i>

25:25.505 --> 25:27.338
<i>at 2 Broadway
near Bowling Green.</i>

25:27.438 --> 25:30.006
He's on the East Side,
she's on the West Side,

25:30.106 --> 25:32.271
they don't know each other,
and somehow,

25:32.371 --> 25:34.205
we have to make it look

25:34.305 --> 25:35.772
like they are colluding.

25:35.872 --> 25:37.138
Any ideas?

25:37.238 --> 25:38.872
Easy. Photoshop.

25:38.972 --> 25:42.305
Hmm, nah. They'll use
cell phone pings to deny that.

25:42.405 --> 25:44.772
It's a trick question.
He already knows.

25:44.872 --> 25:46.772
You already know, don't you?

25:48.605 --> 25:51.271
Well, given the background
information package

25:51.371 --> 25:53.538
provided to me
by Arda Analytics,

25:53.706 --> 25:54.471
I think I have some

25:54.571 --> 25:56.271
exploitable facts on these two.

25:56.371 --> 26:00.338
She prides herself on her
punctuality and hates dogs.

26:00.438 --> 26:01.772
He is a consummate gentleman,

26:01.872 --> 26:03.105
and has his driver
pick him up at exactly

26:03.205 --> 26:05.438
<i>8:15 on the dot,</i>

26:05.538 --> 26:07.072
<i>every morning without fail.</i>

26:07.171 --> 26:08.605
And?

26:08.706 --> 26:11.706
That's it, that's all we need.
Pretty cut and dry.

26:11.706 --> 26:13.039
It is?

26:13.138 --> 26:14.471
Yup.

26:14.571 --> 26:15.571
So...

26:15.706 --> 26:18.039
who's got a valid
class A driver's license?

26:38.271 --> 26:40.238
On my mark.

26:40.338 --> 26:41.872
Three... two...

26:41.972 --> 26:43.471
One.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.739
what's going on?

26:55.839 --> 26:57.138
Looks like
an engine fire or something.

26:57.238 --> 26:58.772
Goddamn it.

27:14.806 --> 27:16.538
How'd Hafiz do
with the hack?

27:16.706 --> 27:17.772
I love it.

27:17.872 --> 27:19.205
Elon should hire him.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.706
Check it out.

27:23.405 --> 27:25.305
Stop it. It freaks me out.

27:25.405 --> 27:26.839
Oh, you're no fun.

27:26.939 --> 27:29.706
Screw this.
I'm getting a cab.

27:32.238 --> 27:35.305
- Hey, you on the clock?
- No, pal, sorry.

27:36.205 --> 27:37.505
Hey, you on the clock?

27:37.605 --> 27:38.906
Yes, yes, I take you.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.706
Where you want to go?
Downtown.

27:41.706 --> 27:43.271
2 Broadway.

27:50.872 --> 27:53.605
Where are you going?
You said Broadway.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.471
I didn't say to take Broadway.

27:55.571 --> 27:58.538
Sorry, sorry, I'll get you
there very fast. Promise.

28:03.105 --> 28:05.939
Okay, Homm's leaving.

28:06.038 --> 28:07.571
Let's lose his driver.

28:11.806 --> 28:13.005
I'm gonna need you
to move, my guy.

28:13.105 --> 28:14.471
- I'm picking up.
- Yeah, well,

28:14.571 --> 28:15.839
you're going to have
to go round the block.

28:15.939 --> 28:18.538
Why?
- No standing traffic.

28:18.706 --> 28:21.505
Around the block
or I'll slap a boot on you.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.772
Where are you going?
I need to go south.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.438
Ah, good idea! I take 5th.

28:36.171 --> 28:38.772
You are seriously
the dumbest cab driver

28:38.872 --> 28:40.371
I have ever met.

28:42.839 --> 28:44.038
Get out of the cab!

28:44.138 --> 28:45.706
Are you insane?

28:45.806 --> 28:47.138
Okay, this is it.

28:47.238 --> 28:48.338
Cara, where are you?

28:48.438 --> 28:49.906
Okay. Almost there.

28:55.806 --> 28:58.605
I need a cab.
Yes, ma'am.

29:03.338 --> 29:05.038
Cara, she's not close enough.

29:05.138 --> 29:06.605
Do you have any idea
what I'm dealing with here?

29:06.706 --> 29:09.238
I hear you,
but we're about to lose her.

29:09.338 --> 29:10.571
<i>CARA [over radio]:
I'm coming!</i>

29:10.706 --> 29:12.706
Oh, fuck this. Jesus.

29:12.806 --> 29:14.706
Oh, oh!
[chuckles] Oh!

29:14.706 --> 29:16.471
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

29:16.571 --> 29:18.238
Come on, guys! Come on!

29:18.338 --> 29:19.872
So sorry.

29:19.971 --> 29:21.505
Hey.

29:21.605 --> 29:24.305
- Hmm?
- You drop something?

29:30.405 --> 29:32.839
Excuse me, ma'am,
is this yours?

29:34.971 --> 29:36.305
Oh, yes.

29:36.405 --> 29:38.238
Thank you so much.

29:38.338 --> 29:39.938
That's it, everybody.
Melt away.

31:51.271 --> 31:53.405
Jonathan, it's your turn.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.005
Just take the shovel.

31:56.105 --> 31:58.038
Jonathan, take it.
Just take the shovel!

31:58.138 --> 32:00.238
Take it. Take it!

32:16.038 --> 32:17.771
Nice.

32:17.871 --> 32:19.338
Clever cover.

32:20.138 --> 32:23.305
You can skip to the last photo
for the coup de grâce.

32:26.705 --> 32:28.205
Oh, there it is.

32:28.305 --> 32:29.771
Problem solved.

32:29.871 --> 32:31.338
Yeah.

32:32.338 --> 32:34.271
I assume
there weren't any hitches?

32:34.371 --> 32:35.705
Buttoned up tight.

32:35.705 --> 32:37.105
Well, I will have Xander

32:37.205 --> 32:38.871
- wire the money right now.
- Thank you.

32:38.971 --> 32:40.371
Don't be a stranger, John.

32:40.471 --> 32:42.371
We should talk more often.

32:42.471 --> 32:43.771
You know where I am.

32:43.871 --> 32:45.171
Sure thing.

32:46.105 --> 32:47.705
I'll see you around?

33:23.871 --> 33:26.505
So we got a good pull
from her face, lot of hits.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.405
So, who is she?
No one.

33:29.505 --> 33:31.071
Or a very well-cultivated
no one.

33:31.171 --> 33:34.438
Lawyer, lives in Pittsburgh,
works for a non-profit there.

33:34.538 --> 33:35.905
The Homeless Aid Network.

33:36.005 --> 33:37.205
They have offices here, too.

33:37.305 --> 33:39.271
Income?
Still digging. But...

33:39.371 --> 33:40.838
she does have expensive taste,

33:40.938 --> 33:43.271
which doesn't quite line up
with her job.

33:43.371 --> 33:44.871
Maybe she divorced a rich guy.

33:44.971 --> 33:46.471
Mm, sexist much?

33:46.571 --> 33:49.171
Could be family money.
Trust fund do-gooder maybe.

33:49.271 --> 33:50.505
What name did you get?

33:50.605 --> 33:53.338
Hailey Marie Winton.

33:54.271 --> 33:55.405
Fuck.

33:55.505 --> 33:57.105
Why are we looking at her?

33:57.205 --> 33:58.738
Testing my bullshit meter.

33:58.838 --> 34:00.038
What else you got?

34:01.805 --> 34:04.105
Went to Lehigh,
born in Pennsylvania,

34:04.205 --> 34:06.705
has no criminal record.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.271
You got an address
on the charity?

34:09.371 --> 34:11.271
Yes.

34:11.371 --> 34:12.738
Up by Times Square.

34:12.838 --> 34:16.571
What was she doing
in Valence's neighborhood?

34:20.105 --> 34:21.371
Is something wrong?

34:21.471 --> 34:23.505
I don't know.

34:23.604 --> 34:25.438
I just got a bad feeling.

34:26.505 --> 34:28.871
Wasn't this place built
on your bad feelings?

34:30.005 --> 34:31.438
Fair enough.

34:31.538 --> 34:33.938
I gotta go.
What-- Now?

34:34.038 --> 34:35.238
We have Tom at 6:00, remember?

34:35.338 --> 34:37.205
I'll be back before that.

- Oh.

35:01.805 --> 35:03.338
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

35:03.438 --> 35:05.238
How do I always pick
the weird stalker guys?

35:05.338 --> 35:06.604
I'm not a st...

35:06.705 --> 35:07.938
- That's not what I'm doing.
- It is not?

35:08.038 --> 35:09.071
Then what? What is this?

35:09.171 --> 35:10.371
Look, I just need to know

35:10.471 --> 35:11.338
what you were doing
at 35th and 9th.

35:11.438 --> 35:12.738
Are you following me?

35:12.838 --> 35:14.205
- Please, go away.
- I'm not following you.

35:14.305 --> 35:15.570
Please, just answer
the question.

35:15.705 --> 35:17.171
You know what?
There's a cop right there.

35:17.271 --> 35:18.705
- Do I need to go talk to him?
- Hailey, I need to know

35:18.805 --> 35:20.205
- who you were looking for.
- Oh, my God!

35:20.305 --> 35:21.738
I hate dating apps.
I swear to God,

35:21.838 --> 35:23.371
I'm going to smash my phone
for my own good. Look.

35:23.471 --> 35:24.805
I'm going to walk that way,
and you're not.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.071
- You understand?
- What are you talking about,

35:26.171 --> 35:27.371
- dating apps?
- I swiped on you

35:27.471 --> 35:28.705
at the bar,
that's how I found you.

35:28.705 --> 35:31.005
- No, it isn't.
- oh, yeah?

35:32.071 --> 35:34.038
What's this?

35:34.138 --> 35:35.570
What?

35:36.371 --> 35:38.838
That showed up
when I was at the bar?

35:41.205 --> 35:43.371
Hailey?

35:44.271 --> 35:46.271
What?

35:54.938 --> 35:56.371
Oh, fuck.

<i>Video from the scene
recovered by police</i>

37:52.905 --> 37:55.705
<i>shows someone
who appears strikingly similar</i>

37:55.705 --> 37:58.305
<i>to a man wanted in connection
to the murder of</i>

37:58.404 --> 38:01.205
<i>United States
Treasury Officer Edward Homm.</i>

38:01.305 --> 38:02.404
<i>The FBI and NYPD...</i>

38:02.504 --> 38:03.805
<i>Arda Analytics.</i>

38:03.905 --> 38:06.205
- Miles Valence, please.
<i>- Please hold.</i>

38:45.238 --> 38:47.337
30th floor... So go up,
elevator to the right,

38:47.437 --> 38:49.005
go straight up.

38:50.971 --> 38:54.105
Delivery for Arda on 30.
Yeah, sign in.

38:54.205 --> 38:56.404
Sure. You mind holding on
to that for me? Thanks.

38:56.504 --> 38:58.404
That is a bomb.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.705
I have just armed it.
Don't move.

39:00.805 --> 39:01.905
It's rigged
with motion sensors--

39:02.005 --> 39:03.470
you move, the bomb detonates.

39:03.570 --> 39:05.570
If I hear any alarms
or sirens,

39:05.705 --> 39:07.705
I detonate the bomb, understand?

39:08.437 --> 39:11.105
Good. I'll be right back.

39:24.071 --> 39:26.005
What the hell's going on?
- Jesus!

39:27.470 --> 39:29.504
John, you shouldn't be here.

39:29.604 --> 39:31.304
Everything is
completely fucked up.

39:31.404 --> 39:33.304
Were you in that explosion?
What the hell happened?

39:33.404 --> 39:34.470
Cut the crap!

39:34.570 --> 39:36.071
We had nothing
to do with it.

39:36.171 --> 39:37.437
Like you had nothing to do
with that car following me,

39:37.537 --> 39:39.304
or the video being shot,

39:39.404 --> 39:40.705
or the fucking girl!

39:40.705 --> 39:42.238
What girl?
What are you talking about?

39:42.337 --> 39:44.138
Stop lying!

39:46.537 --> 39:48.005
This was not the plan.

39:48.105 --> 39:49.905
Shut up!

39:51.071 --> 39:53.304
The plan is the plan.

39:53.404 --> 39:54.705
Nothing has changed.

39:54.705 --> 39:56.805
So what's next?
Me showing up dead?

39:59.138 --> 40:01.971
Miles, what is it?

40:04.805 --> 40:07.570
Just give me a second. Okay?

40:07.671 --> 40:08.905
Yeah?

40:09.005 --> 40:10.470
A second.

40:10.570 --> 40:11.671
I heard you.

40:11.771 --> 40:13.671
I understand.

40:26.871 --> 40:29.771
Tell him I had no choice.

40:34.204 --> 40:35.604
Miles, no!

40:54.171 --> 40:55.504
<i>GUARD [on radio]:
Anyone have eyes on him?</i>

41:23.705 --> 41:25.071
Shit.

41:26.905 --> 41:28.938
Move! Move!

41:40.838 --> 41:41.771
<i>OFFICER 2 [on radio]:
