WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:04.129
(siren wailing)

00:04.212 --> 00:07.007
(tires squeal)

00:10.093 --> 00:11.803
(tires screech)

00:11.886 --> 00:14.305
Take the next alley.
I'll meet you back there.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.226
Help! Robbery!

00:19.269 --> 00:21.062
Help! Police!

00:21.146 --> 00:22.355
Damn! Jackie!

00:22.439 --> 00:23.356
MAN: You creep!

00:28.319 --> 00:29.863
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.156
Stay here.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.661
-(tires squeal)
-(siren wailing)

00:36.745 --> 00:39.581
All units, sector C,
trick robbery in progress.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.625
(tires screech)

00:42.709 --> 00:44.377
Police! Stop right there!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.671
I said hold it!

00:46.755 --> 00:48.423
(grunts)

00:50.633 --> 00:52.385
Hold it! Don't move! You're under arrest!

00:52.469 --> 00:55.513
-(siren wailing)
-(indistinct radio chatter)

01:03.480 --> 01:05.398
-Did you see the victim?
-Uh-uh.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.608
What's the shot, man?

01:06.691 --> 01:08.443
Just shut up for a second.

01:08.526 --> 01:09.986
We got to run him over to Mercy.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.071
Kate, you all right?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.114
<i>Yeah. Got her.</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:16.367
I'm taking the pimp over to Mercy.
If you see the victim, grab him.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.453
-Hey, ain't no victim!
-Shut up!

01:18.536 --> 01:23.166
Okay, item 5: robberies
associated with prostitution.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.418
Now, the counteroffensive
continues, people,

01:25.502 --> 01:29.631
so I'm gonna be giving more half
and quarter shifts on night work.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.258
Now, Sergeant Bates and Officer McBride

01:32.342 --> 01:33.802
drew a quarter this morning.

01:33.885 --> 01:37.847
Now, assuming that they continue,
there's gonna be room for two more teams.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.015
Item 6:

01:40.308 --> 01:43.353
Heights Detective Vince Delaberto

01:43.436 --> 01:45.605
was shot to death last night

01:45.688 --> 01:48.108
in a parking lot on Portland Avenue,

01:48.191 --> 01:50.527
assailant or assailants unknown.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.905
Now, if you hear of anything
at all that relates,

01:53.988 --> 01:57.951
contact Detective Lieutenant Louis Hamlin
over at the Heights.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.371
Item 7,
I got a call from Joe Coffey's sister.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.333
She wants to thank everybody
for the outpourings of thoughts,

02:05.416 --> 02:08.336
sympathies, plus the scholarship fund,

02:08.419 --> 02:10.839
which they're gonna wait
until fall to set up.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.300
Item 8: everybody say hello

02:14.384 --> 02:17.095
to Officer Ron Lipsky from the Polk,

02:17.178 --> 02:21.307
and Officer Michael Galva.
He's from Midtown.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.644
Now, I'm gonna pair you two together,
at least for a couple of days,

02:24.727 --> 02:26.729
till this flu situation calms down.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.191
Then maybe we can pair you
with more senior personnel, okay?

02:30.275 --> 02:31.568
-All right.
-Welcome.

02:31.651 --> 02:35.738
Item last,
this is a bulletin from public health.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.284
Uh, let's see here. Yeah.

02:39.367 --> 02:43.872
"The problem of, uh, uh, pediculosis

02:43.955 --> 02:46.541
pubic, uh, pediculosis pubic

02:46.624 --> 02:49.752
has become acute
in several city precincts.

02:50.378 --> 02:54.841
Individuals are indicated
to inspect themselves

02:54.924 --> 02:58.303
and their personal areas
for signs of infection."

02:58.386 --> 03:00.388
Sarge, what are we exactly
talking about here?

03:00.471 --> 03:02.891
Let me finish. Let me finish.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.853
"Failure to control <i>pediculosis</i>

03:06.936 --> 03:09.230
can result in puncta,

03:09.314 --> 03:12.650
um, lesions,

03:12.734 --> 03:16.154
and in severe cases, no, extreme cases,

03:16.237 --> 03:20.617
severe... <i>furunculosis."</i>

03:20.700 --> 03:23.995
-What is pediculosis?
-Or "frunculunctulosis"?

03:24.078 --> 03:27.957
I don't... oh, here it is.
It's in plain English.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.627
-Crabs.
-(laughter)

03:30.710 --> 03:34.088
-Told you.
-Crab lice, yeah, crab lice.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.842
Okay, that's it. Let's go.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.136
They're getting away out there.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.264
(indistinct chatter)

03:44.599 --> 03:47.018
Maurice Haynes, suspicion of robbery.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.604
-Yeah, you got a big imagination, girl.
-Yeah, right.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.814
-Check out his parole status.
-Hey, wait a minute.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.858
-That's personal possessions.
-Forget it.

03:53.942 --> 03:54.859
Hold on.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.862
Detective Belker, line three!

03:57.946 --> 04:00.198
Right! Right! Right! Come on, walk!

04:01.074 --> 04:02.367
All right, right here!

04:03.701 --> 04:05.203
Sit, armpit!

04:09.332 --> 04:10.458
Belker.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.418
Hi, honey.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.129
What's wrong?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.048
I hear it in your voice.
Something's wrong.

04:17.131 --> 04:21.261
Captain, I need, uh,
I need some personal time today.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.304
-Any problem?
-Yeah, personal.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.474
Hand over anything
that needs attention to Henry.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.518
Hey, you got her.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.062
Yep, that ought to cut a few robberies.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.522
You loaded or something?

04:32.605 --> 04:33.648
(laughs)

04:33.731 --> 04:35.191
Jackie Lowrie, robbery, second,

04:35.275 --> 04:38.194
and a controlled substance,
to wit, marijuana.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.696
Also a couple of credit cards.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.863
Oh, boy.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.157
Yeah.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.536
Right away, honey. Goodbye.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.121
Oh, boy.

04:48.955 --> 04:49.789
Oh.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.583
Hey, hey, look here. You gonna faint, man?

04:53.751 --> 04:55.336
Come on, here, take a hit of oxygen.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.379
Yeah.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.433
Hey, Mick, you all right?

05:08.516 --> 05:10.768
(high-pitched)
Robin just started contractions.

05:10.852 --> 05:11.936
Mick?

05:13.354 --> 05:15.231
Would you watch my suspect, Stan?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.649
-Sure.
-Thank you.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.277
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:19.360 --> 05:21.446
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:21.529 --> 05:25.325
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:26.909
(theme music playing)

06:33.476 --> 06:35.103
(telephone ringing)

06:35.186 --> 06:37.397
There was a robbery. We got two suspects.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.941
We're holding them
both at garden level temporarily.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.192
Thanks, Sergeant.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.570
Lieutenant, what I am simply trying
to impress on you

06:44.654 --> 06:46.781
is that these profits
from your house sale can be,

06:46.864 --> 06:49.283
A, tax sheltered; B, rolled over--

06:49.367 --> 06:50.576
Later, okay?

06:50.660 --> 06:53.162
Now, given that your established pattern
is real estate,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.748
what about seven units
in suburban Phoenix?

06:55.832 --> 06:57.750
We are talking sunbelt here, Lieutenant.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.336
I mean, there are people out there
to fill these apartments.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.005
-Mr. Urgis, please.
-It's been a pleasure.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.134
Mr. Styles, he says nothing
but good things about you.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.927
We really want to be in business.

07:09.220 --> 07:13.057
Or maybe I could interest you
in a prime massage parlor on Jefferson.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.225
Shut up, J.D.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.769
Hey, a man
with your Midas touch, Lieutenant.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.646
Good morning, Lieutenant Goldstein.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.442
I can't represent both of you

07:22.525 --> 07:25.111
because of potential conflicts of interest
between you.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.655
-You saying she'd turn around on me?
-No, I wouldn't.

07:27.738 --> 07:32.034
Regardless, I need to be free to represent
any client in his or her best interests.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.911
-Now, which one?
-You take her, Jackie.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.205
I don't care for her attitude no way.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.082
(siren wailing)

07:38.166 --> 07:40.543
Oh, it's not hard to understand, Frank.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.712
Those insurance people are old,

07:42.795 --> 07:44.547
entrenched conservatives.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.092
The commission report killed my chances
for that consultancy.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.343
I'm sorry, Chief.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.513
I wrote a letter I thought
put things in perspective.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.557
The hell with it, Frank.
I'm not mad at you.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.935
Those consultant positions
are a hoax anyway, aren't they?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.146
I mean, all they want you
to do is read reports

08:00.229 --> 08:03.274
and advise them to raise
insurance rates for blacks. (exhales)

08:04.066 --> 08:05.526
But I sure could've used the money.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.821
I'm gonna be paying alimony.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.741
-You and Cora--
-She's totally rejected me, Frank.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.204
For the last two years, the only thing
I've gotten off Cora is freezer burn.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.123
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.708
It's been very hard.

08:21.417 --> 08:24.378
Women sense that I'm very much a man,

08:25.296 --> 08:28.216
but out of loyalty
to the vows of marriage,

08:28.299 --> 08:31.844
I have not substantially strayed
from the straight and narrow.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.138
Anyway, that's over.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.849
It's gonna cost me, but I'll be free.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.227
Sorry to unburden,

08:39.310 --> 08:41.437
but I know you've been through a divorce.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.688
You know all the moves.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.859
Maybe there's someway
things can still work out.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.779
(exhales) Not the remotest chance.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.156
Of course, it kills me politically,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.742
at least for the time being.
But frankly, I don't give a damn.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.370
What about your own plans?

08:57.453 --> 08:59.997
-Still tight-lipped?
-I don't have any plans.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.917
Come on, Frank, I happen to know
there's a Kingmakers' lunch

09:03.000 --> 09:05.461
at the Hastings Club,
and you're the guest of honor.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.630
You're more up on things than I am.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.674
I just got the call
inviting me ten minutes ago.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.217
You're out here in the provinces.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.512
The rumor's been buzzing around City Hall
for the last two days.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.515
The only question was,
"What will Ozzie do?"

09:17.598 --> 09:18.432
I don't follow.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.851
I'm sure they'll make it clear over lunch.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.397
You say a robbery never happened at all?

09:25.022 --> 09:26.691
I was turning a trick, all right?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.859
Maurice was there
on account of the white dude

09:28.943 --> 09:30.486
was having some difficulties.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.531
You mean the john?
The john was having sexual difficulties?

09:33.614 --> 09:36.075
Yeah, so it was going on a while,

09:36.158 --> 09:38.202
so Maurice was afraid, that's all.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.540
Hey, the dude split.
They don't even have the dude, am I right?

09:42.623 --> 09:44.792
That's right.
To my knowledge, the john's gone.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.170
So you know how come they're calling it
a robbery without no vic?

09:48.254 --> 09:51.924
I believe because Officer McBride
claims to have seen part of the robbery,

09:52.008 --> 09:53.968
and she's making herself a witness.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.178
Admittedly, that makes for a weaker case--

09:56.262 --> 09:58.598
-Uh-uh.
-"Uh-uh" what?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.474
Ain't why they charging it.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.601
Then why?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.145
Because that cop McBride's mad at me.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.856
-You know why?
-(exhales) Why?

10:06.939 --> 10:10.067
Because after the incident,
she took me down by the river,

10:10.151 --> 10:12.570
-and I refused her.
-You refused her?

10:12.653 --> 10:15.114
Yeah, she wanted me, understand?

10:15.197 --> 10:16.699
I said no.

10:18.367 --> 10:22.830
11:30? Well, barring any unforeseen
mobilizations, I'll be there.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.335
No, no, not at all. No. Given the givens.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.794
This call's a pleasure.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.880
Right.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.299
Stan, I'll be at McMann's.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.177
We get claims of sexual harassment
every other week.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.471
-And sometimes they're true.
-Sometimes.

10:38.554 --> 10:42.183
More often,
they're just lame efforts to beat a rap.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.894
But there's no rap to beat here.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.356
No victim, just third-party observation
of ambiguous events.

10:48.439 --> 10:52.068
-Victim may still turn up.
-I want this investigated, Furillo,

10:52.151 --> 10:55.237
or a misconduct complaint
against the officer's next.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.155
Uh?

10:56.238 --> 10:57.448
(clears throat)

10:57.531 --> 11:00.076
Seems I'm not going to be police chief.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.369
Oh?

11:01.452 --> 11:02.953
Not this year anyway.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.455
Fletcher's gonna stay.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.999
His appointment
with the insurance company fell through.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.337
Is it treason to say I'm relieved?
(laughs)

11:11.420 --> 11:13.631
Join the party. Also, Graham called.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.176
I'm meeting my political angels at 2:00.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.219
Big day, Furillo.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.223
Don't forget Jackie Lowrie.

11:25.893 --> 11:30.356
Stan, pull paperwork
on officer McBride's bust, please.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.067
I told my old man
they were putting me on the Hill.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.278
He says, "Forget the new car.
It's just gonna get broken into.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.072
Get yourself life insurance."

11:38.698 --> 11:41.659
-Is your dad a cop?
-Second in command down at forensics.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.120
-Lipsky. You've never heard of him?
-Uh-uh.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.622
(laughs) Sooner or later, you will.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.917
He's the kind of guy who gets roasted
at all the PBA dinners.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.669
He's an old bag of wind.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.256
-What, are you Irish, Mike?
-Yeah.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.967
-Where'd you go to school?
-Aquinas.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.802
I used to go out
with the St. Mary's girls.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.137
-No kidding.
-Oh, yeah.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.848
Best girls in the city are St. Mary's.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.891
Did you know Mary Ann Fogerty?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.311
-Uh-uh.
-Kathy Riley, red hair, freckles.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.522
I didn't know her,
but, yeah, I remember her.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.065
She was pretty hot-looking, huh?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.276
Very caliente, my friend. Very.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.986
(laughs)

12:17.069 --> 12:19.488
-Hey, when did you get out of the academy?
-April.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.699
December before.
-Oh, a veteran.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.618
DISPATCH:
<i>We got a jumper. Location is 805 Culver.</i>

12:24.702 --> 12:27.747
-That's ours. 2205 handling.
-(siren wailing)

12:27.830 --> 12:29.915
-You ever have one of these, Mike?
-Uh-uh.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.460
Gotta use psychology.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.841
Your lucky day, huh, Tommy?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.634
Hey, Guid, you give me a jump.

12:40.718 --> 12:44.180
You got nothing to be nervous about.
You oughta be buying drinks for everybody.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.766
-Your troubles are over, aren't they?
-How you think that?

12:46.849 --> 12:50.394
-The man's dead.
-Come on, let's not get morbid here.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.022
You know. It wasn't easy,
but I tried hard to believe you.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.608
-What are you talking about?
-I tried and I figure my efforts

12:55.691 --> 12:57.985
-are worth something.
-Don't cat and mouse me, Guid.

12:58.068 --> 12:58.903
I don't go for that.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.905
Just couldn't tough it out,
could you, Tommy?

13:00.988 --> 13:03.032
You just got restless,
and you went for it.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.410
Wait a minute.
Delaberto, you think that was me.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.495
I know it was you.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.830
You're finished, Tommy.
You're a busted valise.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.082
Come on. I'm hearing you say this,
and I'm thinking,

13:12.166 --> 13:14.752
"Are you okay?
Or have you started barking at the moon?"

13:14.835 --> 13:16.879
You're gone, Tommy. You're on memory lane.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.672
You and I talked.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.592
You said Delaberto was gonna let
this turn to steam.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.761
You think after that
that I'd whack the guy?

13:23.844 --> 13:27.097
Now, I didn't think so, but you did it.
Now I feel kind of responsible.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.058
Oh, what? All of a sudden, you're IAD?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.893
Uh-uh. I'm worse. I was your friend.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.895
I tried to help you,
and you dumped all over me.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.189
-You're crazy.
-I gotta get involved in this.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.482
Involved how?

13:37.399 --> 13:39.735
I honestly don't know
what I'm gonna do, Tommy.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.948
Hey. Wait!

13:44.740 --> 13:45.950
Guido!

13:46.033 --> 13:46.951
Hey.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.371
She wants to talk to you, man.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.833
Liar. She doesn't.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.044
I'm not a liar. She's on the phone.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.507
I can't get the phone on the ledge, man.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.760
Come on. Want a cig?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.263
-I'm gonna jump, man. Stand back.
-Cut it out.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.181
She's on the way over here.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.809
-You want to talk to her inside?
-I said I'm gonna jump.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.812
-I don't need her. You tell her that.
-You tell her that. Tell her that.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.605
Wait till she gets here and tell her that.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.941
-I'm gonna jump.
-Calm down. Take it easy.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.317
Calm down? You calm down.

14:20.401 --> 14:23.070
Come on inside.
She'll be there, I guarantee it.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.613
Nah, no way.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.782
I'm gonna jump.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.075
You don't want to see her?

14:28.158 --> 14:29.118
No.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.703
(exhales)

14:31.745 --> 14:33.289
Now I'm gonna do it.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.500
Hey, don't yank my chain.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.044
Look, if you really want to do it, do it.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.672
But I don't think you do. Hey! Hey!

14:41.755 --> 14:45.009
(horror music plays)

14:47.136 --> 14:49.555
(siren wailing)

14:49.638 --> 14:52.016
Stop pushing. Get back.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.517
Let the officer through.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.561
Come on. Make some room here.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.104
(melancholic music plays)

15:05.696 --> 15:08.490
Could I ask you what the damn hell
you were doing, Officer?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.909
What were you doing?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.994
I was trying to keep the guy from jumping.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.080
What I'm hearing is you told him,
"Go ahead and jump."

15:15.164 --> 15:17.625
That's out of context, sir.
I tried everything else.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.419
What about trying to wait
until the negotiating officer arrives

15:20.502 --> 15:23.422
-who could bring some expertise to bear?
-I was waiting.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.717
(exhales)
I was trying to stabilize the situation.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.762
So you thought maybe a little reverse
psychology might do the trick.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.097
You reversed the guy pretty good, Officer.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.141
I want full witness statements.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.941
I've recently come to realize
who I am, Lieutenant.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.443
You may find this odd, but so have I.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.197
Only I've been under treatment.

15:49.448 --> 15:53.035
My friend, I've had the purgative
of profound emotional pain,

15:53.118 --> 15:55.245
relentless series of disenchantments

15:55.329 --> 15:57.957
that have swept through my life
like a flight of harpies.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.669
-The Englishwoman?
-Yes.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.879
She, uh, she left me

16:04.672 --> 16:06.507
in the most bizarre of circumstances.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.052
She seemed very... smart.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.055
It's been hard going, my friend,

16:13.973 --> 16:18.060
but I think... I think I'm better for it.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.229
I think you deserved it, Lieutenant.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.816
Yes, we're not suited as acolytes of Venus

16:23.899 --> 16:26.402
kneeling before the fleshy shrines
of carnal pleasure.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.362
Do you know
what kind of men we are, Ballan--

16:28.445 --> 16:30.614
-Samurai.
-(chuckles)

16:31.949 --> 16:35.995
Yes. I was gonna say Spartans,
but Samurai is just as correct.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.413
I know.

16:38.455 --> 16:44.586
I'm sure that I could easily be to blame
for your earlier confusion.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.549
Yes, you are to blame,
but things are different now.

16:48.632 --> 16:53.637
Jack, we have both come
through cleansing rites of passage,

16:53.721 --> 16:56.181
and now it's time
to restore the previous order.

16:56.682 --> 17:01.061
Judas, don't you long
for the old leader camaraderie,

17:01.145 --> 17:02.771
the stuff of barracks and ballads?

17:03.397 --> 17:06.525
I'm really ready
for a good fight, Lieutenant.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.236
I know that combat can restore honor.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.571
No question.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.990
Rather than fail,

17:13.073 --> 17:16.243
the ninja warrior
cuts off his own fingers.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.454
Come back on board, Ballantine,

17:18.537 --> 17:21.415
and we'll put your new knowledge
of martial science to good use.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.795
(cheerful music plays)

17:29.006 --> 17:31.008
(suspenseful music plays)

17:32.426 --> 17:34.011
(sighs)

17:44.188 --> 17:46.732
(keys jingling)

17:51.195 --> 17:52.321
Hey, Mary.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.782
Guido, I'm surprised to see you.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.203
-Tommy's not here?
-No.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.164
Nah, I just came by to see
how he's keeping the coop up.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.416
My name's still on the lease, you know.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.212
Remember the old days? You, Tommy,
Pete Vanucci playing cards,

18:08.295 --> 18:10.672
-bringing girls up here?
-Nah, we never did that.

18:10.756 --> 18:14.093
Oh, yes, you did.
That's why you guys all rented it.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.345
Anyway, now it's a mess.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.223
Tommy let's it go,
so I'm here to clean it.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.349
Uh-huh.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.601
So how are things between the two of you?

18:22.684 --> 18:23.727
Okay, I guess.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.564
No.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.192
Not so good lately.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.613
What's happened?
He doesn't tell me anything ever.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.949
It's probably nothing you need to know.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.492
But it's something.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.665
I love him. You think I'm stupid?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.168
You love the guy.
What's stupid got to do with it?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.420
Because I'm worried.
What's happening to him?

18:50.879 --> 18:52.965
Listen, I just stopped by. I gotta go.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.259
Why are you here? What's he done?

18:55.342 --> 18:58.095
-I don't want to get you into this, Mary.
-Are you still his friend?

18:58.178 --> 19:01.306
Just tell me you're still his friend.
Then I'll know things are okay.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.518
(melancholic music plays)

19:05.936 --> 19:07.396
You can't say it.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.940
There's nothing I can do for him, Mary.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.609
It's too late.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.030
(door closes)

19:18.031 --> 19:21.285
The prostitute you arrested this morning
has made an accusation.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.078
It's of a sexual nature.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.372
Of a sexual nature?

19:25.455 --> 19:27.332
She says you drove her to the dock area

19:27.416 --> 19:29.543
and there promised to drop
the charges against her

19:29.626 --> 19:31.378
in return for a sexual encounter.

19:31.962 --> 19:36.300
(laughs) With due respect, sir,
I think that's laughable and contemptible.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.302
She's gotta be saying it
to get out of the bust.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.344
Probably she is,

19:39.428 --> 19:41.638
but you could clear up one
question for me, Kathryn.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.723
What's that?

19:42.806 --> 19:45.851
I've compared
your log entries to Sergeant Bates'.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.896
How is it she got back
to the station before you did,

19:48.979 --> 19:51.732
even though she had to take
her suspect to Mercy first?

19:51.815 --> 19:55.694
I interrogated my suspect, Miss Lowrie,
in the squad car before bringing her in.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.654
-It took 20 minutes.
-You interrogated her?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.031
Due to all the john robberies,

19:59.114 --> 20:00.490
I figured her and her pimp
were part of it.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.784
-Where did this interrogation take place?
-Parked.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.913
-Where?
-On 132nd, I believe, sir.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.540
Why isn't that entered in your log book?

20:08.624 --> 20:11.126
Captain, it didn't lead anywhere.
She didn't say anything.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.837
-Why would I record it?
-Only because accusations

20:13.921 --> 20:15.380
like these crop up.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.925
Well, I'm sorry,
but what she says isn't true,

20:18.008 --> 20:20.802
and I think my recording procedures
were within guidelines.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.013
Sir, may I be excused?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.599
You'll be notified
if this goes any further.

20:29.978 --> 20:30.979
Sir,

20:32.648 --> 20:34.691
I realize it's only my second day here.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.862
I don't know what you're thinking,
but this is a lousy start and I hate it.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.621
Hey, Kate, what's up?

20:47.704 --> 20:49.706
Lucy, a couple of seconds?

20:54.753 --> 20:57.089
There's gotta be 20 officers

20:57.172 --> 20:59.299
that said to a guy jump,
and then he just jumps.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.885
They just do it out of mean spite.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.887
Renko, a man doesn't jump and kill himself

21:03.971 --> 21:05.889
just to spite some cop
he's never seen before.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.433
I think they don't like us
and they just jump on purpose.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.435
Coffey had one once. The jumper said,

21:10.519 --> 21:12.187
"One step closer and I'll push you off."

21:12.271 --> 21:14.731
He said, "No, buddy, one step closer
and I'll push you off."

21:14.815 --> 21:16.525
Are we talking Leaping Larrys here?

21:16.608 --> 21:18.860
I just heard about one
in the Heights this morning.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.696
This foolish first-year man,

21:20.779 --> 21:23.740
he tries out his penny ante,
sophomore psychology

21:23.824 --> 21:28.078
and tells this poor soul to go ahead
and jump and he did.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.873
Uh, Lieutenant,
that wasn't in the Heights.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.792
-That was over here.
-Ah. Whatever.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.714
Where the hell
do you get off with this crap?

21:40.173 --> 21:41.925
What the hell do you think you're pulling?

21:42.551 --> 21:45.012
-Answer me!
-Ain't nothing to answer about.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.805
You think this means we drop the case?

21:46.888 --> 21:48.932
-You think you get out to do more robbing?
-Hey.

21:49.016 --> 21:52.352
You answer me, you lying piece of garbage!

21:52.436 --> 21:55.272
-The woman's going for me again!
-Shut up, you!

21:55.355 --> 21:56.898
You denying you took me down there?

21:57.816 --> 21:58.942
Shut up, scum.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.611
Everybody knows you want me.

22:02.279 --> 22:06.199
The report from his doctor recommends
three more weeks of complete rest.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.911
Frank, I know this man. He is 100%.

22:09.995 --> 22:13.206
Listen, Frank, there's another imperative
in this that has to do with me.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.587
(sighs) The last year or so, I have...

22:18.670 --> 22:20.922
I feel that I've sort of let things slip.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.259
I always find your work
to be very satisfactory, Howard.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.596
Satisfactory, but not exemplary.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.849
No, it's time for renaissance, Frank.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.061
A rededication to the only values

22:34.144 --> 22:36.188
that have ever had any meaning to me.

22:37.773 --> 22:41.568
Molding the EATers of this precinct
into the finest assault force in the city.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.238
And with Ballantine back on the team,
I am confident I can do that.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.199
Frank, uh,

22:48.617 --> 22:51.286
it would mean a lot to me right now.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.205
Okay.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.875
-I'll call personnel.
-Thanks.

23:06.635 --> 23:10.347
-Furillo doesn't believe that whore.
-I think he does. You know what he thinks?

23:10.430 --> 23:12.933
He thinks why is a lazy slut
bothering to make an accusation

23:13.016 --> 23:15.769
if it's such a lousy case if it gets
kicked without a victim anyway?

23:16.311 --> 23:18.939
Because she's stupid.
She doesn't know it's gonna get kicked.

23:20.107 --> 23:23.402
Could we just sit down for a second
and calm down, talk about this?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.112
You know how long this case lasts?

23:25.195 --> 23:26.905
Just long enough to get me suspended.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.032
Then let's just drop the case.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.242
Drop the robbery?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.995
Yeah. You just said
it's not got a lot going for it.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.498
It's a thought.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.086
You know, I would rather lose a perp
this month than another partner.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.004
If we drop,
I feel I'm admitting something.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.297
And that's nuts, and I won't.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.883
You're not admitting anything.
It's just a lousy case.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.678
A robbing street whore
is not gonna beat me on this.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.306
Sergeant, I got your parole status
on Maurice Haynes.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.559
He owes six years on a manslaughter.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.854
Thanks. Okay, bingo.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.147
Bingo what?

24:00.230 --> 24:02.649
This is why she accused you.
To protect him.

24:02.732 --> 24:05.277
What you saw wasn't good enough
for a robbery case,

24:05.360 --> 24:06.736
but enough to get him violated.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.947
Consorting with a prostitute,
threatening a guy.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.992
A knife. Maybe I saw a knife.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.119
Okay. We gotta call his parole officer.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.579
If he agrees with me...

24:16.455 --> 24:18.206
I thought to check the holding cells

24:18.290 --> 24:20.959
to see what your officers
in their diligent suppression

24:21.042 --> 24:23.628
of the gay population
picked up by the river this morning.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.880
And?

24:24.963 --> 24:27.632
(sighs) Reynoldo, tell the captain
what you just told me.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.260
Delighted.
Will you get me out of here, honey?

24:30.343 --> 24:32.053
I'll make sure you're on the next bus.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.640
Mr. Selmes was picked up in the AM
sweep of the docks.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.351
Right by where pier 47's at.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.562
White woman in the front, cop.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.439
Black fox in the back.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.191
They're parked there a long time.

24:46.818 --> 24:50.363
-Mick, what happened?
-I don't know.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.324
It seemed like it was gonna happen.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.826
She had the pains.
We rushed to the hospital.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.078
Soon as we get to the hospital,
the pains disappear.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.706
I don't know.
Doctor said it was a false alarm.

24:59.789 --> 25:02.792
-But everything's okay?
-Oh, yeah, she's fine.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.503
Thanks for asking, Stan.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.297
(telephone rings)

25:07.380 --> 25:08.340
Captain.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.136
Are you pursuing the accusation
against my partner?

25:14.137 --> 25:15.263
Yes, I am.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.058
-Can I talk to you?
-Yes, you may.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.018
I know you have to check
things like this out.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.479
It's just that what sickens me
is the implication

25:22.562 --> 25:25.815
that just because a woman is doing
what's traditionally a man's job

25:25.899 --> 25:28.902
that she's open to be called a dyke
by any dingbat out there on the street.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.112
It's stupid. It's just a crock.
You know that.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.907
The percentage
of lesbian cops is damn low--

25:33.990 --> 25:36.076
Lucy, may I interrupt you?

25:36.159 --> 25:38.537
I just spoke to somebody who can place

25:38.620 --> 25:43.083
Officer McBride and Jackie Lowrie
in an extended conversation

25:43.166 --> 25:47.212
under the highway
directly adjoining pier 47.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.089
I don't believe that.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.424
I mean, at that hour,
there's a lot of units down there.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.426
They coop down there.
That's what the guys do.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.761
No, that's correct.

25:54.844 --> 25:57.264
I was on 132nd like I told you, Captain,

25:57.347 --> 25:59.849
but where it ends, at the piers.

26:00.934 --> 26:01.977
Under the elevator?

26:02.060 --> 26:03.645
I was doing my job, Captain,

26:03.728 --> 26:05.772
trying to close a string of robberies.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.525
I felt, in a quiet place,
I could talk to the suspect,

26:09.150 --> 26:10.986
make her feel comfortable, maybe to talk.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.446
Why did you mislead me
about where the talk took place?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.115
I didn't mean to, sir.

26:15.657 --> 26:19.536
I know the piers are used for sex. I guess
I was afraid you might misconstrue.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.246
Captain, it was on her turf.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.956
It was the best place to talk.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.835
And I wish you'd believe me.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.092
I do, Captain. I believe her.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.311
-Frank.
-Graham.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.855
You sure got your grin back.
How do you feel?

26:46.938 --> 26:49.482
-Well, fine.
-Good. That's great.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.192
Frank Furillo, this is Irving Hofler,

26:51.276 --> 26:53.278
-Tom Thompson of the Viking Trust.
-How are you?

26:53.361 --> 26:55.530
We were worried about you,
but everything's fine?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.324
Well, uh, thank you.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.200
I still get more tired than usual.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.745
Well, you just got up,
what, two weeks now?

27:01.828 --> 27:03.580
-Uh, it's a month.
-Hi, Frank.

27:03.663 --> 27:04.914
-Jack Helsinger.
-Hi, Jack.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.917
I saw that on TV and I thought,
"Oh, my God, there goes our candidate."

27:08.001 --> 27:10.253
Mr. Wells, the mayor called.
He won't be coming over.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.173
-He's sending an aide.
-Ozzie was coming here?

27:13.256 --> 27:15.675
Well, he should be involved.
There are no hard feelings.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.178
Not at all. He's a damn nice fellow.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.221
Actually, he seems in a bit of a snit.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.599
Frank, Ozzie will be announcing

27:22.682 --> 27:25.268
sometime next week
that he won't be running for re-election.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.437
After that tragic thing with his boy,

27:27.520 --> 27:29.731
who can blame him
for wanting to step down?

27:29.814 --> 27:31.066
I wasn't aware that he--

27:31.149 --> 27:34.152
I'm sure that it took a great deal
of soul-searching.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.904
Anyway, let's talk about the future.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.782
-Hear! Hear! To you Frank!
-Congratulations.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.492
-Our candidate.
-That's you, Frank.

27:42.535 --> 27:45.246
Oh, uh, Ozzie asked me to convey

27:45.330 --> 27:47.666
that he's very glad that it's you.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.126
He's glad he won't have
to support a candidate

27:50.210 --> 27:51.336
not of his own choice.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.338
I haven't accepted anything yet, Stan.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.757
Listen, I've been
Ozzie's chief of staff for years.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.718
In my experienced opinion,
and Ozzie's, you will.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.929
There's also the matter
of getting elected.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.097
Mm-hmm.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.099
Uh...

28:06.351 --> 28:09.062
Ozzie was embarrassed
to come and talk to you himself.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.605
Embarrassed? Why?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.149
Because he was summoned
here by the suits outside

28:13.233 --> 28:14.651
who treat him like a dog.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.487
Because he's being ousted.

28:17.570 --> 28:20.532
Ousted? I thought he decided himself
he didn't want to run.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.868
It was decided for him, Frank, not by him.

28:24.327 --> 28:26.037
How much power do those guys really have?

28:26.121 --> 28:27.622
Oh ho ho.

28:28.832 --> 28:32.377
You mean you're worried
they might start telling you what to do?

28:32.460 --> 28:35.171
If they do,
I wouldn't be able to accept it.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.926
Frank, look...

28:41.511 --> 28:43.054
Ozzie's got some exposure,

28:43.138 --> 28:45.140
some things he wouldn't want found out.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.809
But he has been an effective mayor.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.728
And you could be.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.314
But don't you ever expect
the people who put you there

28:53.398 --> 28:55.984
to ever let you forget they did it.

28:57.193 --> 28:58.820
They're men who remember.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.364
Does that answer your question?

29:01.448 --> 29:02.407
In a way.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.413
Don't let it worry you, Frank.

29:08.496 --> 29:12.083
It's something
you just learn to live with.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.673
Anyway, hey, Ozzie sends his best, huh?

29:24.888 --> 29:26.890
-Hey, Lieutenant.
-Captain.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.850
-Social call?
-Uh-uh.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.059
Didn't think so.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.478
-Can I close this?
-Sure.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.317
(sighs) So, what do you got on Delaberto?

29:37.817 --> 29:39.819
Very slick, probably professional.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.029
Who's on it?

29:41.112 --> 29:43.281
You know, Hamlin and Stein.
The best I got.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.575
Yeah. And you know me, Bob.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.036
I'm not a guy
that ever runs to the principal,

29:48.119 --> 29:49.871
but I gotta tell you
what I know about, uh,

29:51.164 --> 29:52.957
about Donahue re: Delaberto.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.417
Meaning what?

29:58.254 --> 29:59.631
Donahue whacked him.

30:02.759 --> 30:03.593
You know that?

30:04.385 --> 30:05.428
It's been coming on.

30:06.054 --> 30:09.516
Tommy came running to me about a week ago,
says Delaberto's been creeping up on him.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.934
Creeping up on him, why?

30:11.017 --> 30:13.937
Tommy put his arm around some evidence
and Delaberto's building a case.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.731
Delaberto never talked to me
about any in-house charges.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.233
It was real. I talked to him.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.944
You know how Vince was.
He never said nothing till he was ready.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.405
Well,

30:24.489 --> 30:26.366
let me get Hamlin and Stein in here.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.283
No.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.077
This is for your ears only.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.037
You mean we're talking
one of your hunches here?

30:31.120 --> 30:32.539
No, I know he did it, Bob.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.916
I don't have the evidence,
but I know he did it.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.711
Now, I figure somebody better
get him off the street.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.591
Where'd you go?

30:43.675 --> 30:46.261
I took a walk,
getting a little claustrophobic.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.846
Can I talk to you for a second?

30:48.429 --> 30:50.348
-Okay.
-Someplace?

30:50.431 --> 30:51.474
Let's go.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.019
(telephone ringing)

30:55.812 --> 30:58.690
Ron, I have reviewed the material
on the jumping incident.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.358
I'm sorry, but it warrants notation.

31:01.025 --> 31:01.860
For sure, sir?

31:01.943 --> 31:04.112
You'll get PBA notice
of your appeal rights.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.616
Lieutenant, no disrespect intended,

31:08.700 --> 31:11.619
but we were waiting for you 15 minutes.
Where were you, sir?

31:12.328 --> 31:14.372
-Where was I?
-Yes, sir.

31:14.455 --> 31:18.001
I was downstairs on my way up
when the guy landed in front of me.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.885
While you were out,
Lowrie filed for review board.

31:28.177 --> 31:31.598
But really, that's kind of
standard procedure for the P.D.'s office.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.975
They just want to protect their clients.

31:34.058 --> 31:37.645
Lucy, I didn't do it.
I didn't offer anything.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.230
I told you I believed you. I still do.

31:39.314 --> 31:42.025
-I was just surprised.
-I'm saying this for your own sake.

31:42.775 --> 31:45.862
I don't think you should go on defending
me on the ground I'm not a lesbian.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.156
Oh?

31:48.239 --> 31:50.116
Yeah, that's what I think.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.202
Well, I don't want to pry, Kate,

31:53.286 --> 31:55.830
but are you saying you are?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.544
I don't think it has anything
to do with anything except what it is.

32:03.755 --> 32:07.926
Well, I feel a little bit the fool.
I went in to Furillo to talk to him,

32:08.009 --> 32:10.219
and some of the things I said,

32:10.303 --> 32:13.056
then it turns out
that you did go to the pier.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.557
-And then--
-Don't say that.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.643
That was a lucky guess
on Lowrie's part, huh?

32:16.726 --> 32:17.727
Lucy!

32:18.686 --> 32:20.813
You don't know what you're saying!
This is my job!

32:22.148 --> 32:24.943
Think! Would I jeopardize my job?

32:28.780 --> 32:29.822
(exhales)

32:32.492 --> 32:35.161
I guess I already have.
I guess I've done that pretty good.

32:39.832 --> 32:40.792
Okay.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.338
Uh, like we were saying,

32:46.881 --> 32:48.591
the pimp's the one we gotta lean on.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.887
We lean on him, then he leans on her.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.600
You want to try it?

32:58.184 --> 33:00.520
Uh-huh. Okay.

33:01.938 --> 33:02.814
Okay.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.734
-Sergeant.
-Yeah?

33:06.818 --> 33:09.195
Who's the guy if the call
came in on the jumper

33:09.278 --> 33:11.072
supposed to give it to the lieutenant?

33:11.155 --> 33:13.658
Check with Melvin. Something wrong?

33:13.741 --> 33:16.452
-This is going in Ron's jacket.
-On that set of facts?

33:16.536 --> 33:18.705
-Look, I know it was bonehead.
-It wasn't bonehead.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.165
-You were out on the ledge.
-I'll check to see if somebody

33:21.249 --> 33:23.710
flubbed giving Lieutenant the call,
because if you ask me,

33:23.793 --> 33:25.044
that's where there's fault.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.088
-Yeah, check with Melvin.
-Thank you.

33:27.171 --> 33:30.883
-(indistinct chatter)
-(telephone ringing)

33:30.967 --> 33:33.636
Listen close now, Maurice.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.848
Even if you could shut my partner up
with your running mate's story,

33:36.931 --> 33:38.683
we still found the credit cards on Jackie.

33:38.766 --> 33:39.642
What about that?

33:39.726 --> 33:41.394
What about that is one
of those credit cards

33:41.477 --> 33:43.062
probably belonged
to the guy you were robbing.

33:43.146 --> 33:46.065
And that's the guy that's gonna put you
away regardless of my partner.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.734
Hey. I wasn't robbing nobody, okay?

33:47.817 --> 33:51.195
Tell your girlfriend Jackie to stop lying
about the molestations

33:51.279 --> 33:55.074
-and the propositions.
-Hey, I wasn't there. Was you?

33:55.700 --> 33:58.911
Last call, Mo. Otherwise,
we're out there digging up the john.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.830
What john? Ain't no john.

34:00.913 --> 34:02.498
Boy, are you stupid.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.671
(telephone ringing)

34:12.008 --> 34:14.552
-You hump.
-Hey, that's somebody's chair.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.055
-My partner.
-Now, you watch your language.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.681
I'm on suspension.

34:18.765 --> 34:22.268
Khaki told me how you snuck in
to see Urgis and I'm on suspension.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.436
Get outta here, Donahue.

34:23.519 --> 34:26.689
You're going out of your way
to make trouble for me, Guid.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.400
-I can't let this go.
-What, are you threatening me?

34:29.484 --> 34:31.402
You think this is an Irish wedding?
Beat it.

34:31.486 --> 34:34.989
How could you, Guid? I was your friend.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.115
That's good, Tommy.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.993
Anytime you use that word,
keep it in the past tense

34:39.077 --> 34:41.621
because I don't want no confusion.
Now, get out.

34:46.626 --> 34:52.215
-Uh-huh. Stolen two weeks ago.
-It's a gas card. You don't run gas cards?

34:52.298 --> 34:54.300
One of you, line 3.

34:54.383 --> 34:55.301
Got it.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.512
Sergeant Bates.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.598
Reported stolen this morning?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.434
Uh-huh. Staying at the Marquis.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.479
Great. Malcolm, thanks.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.856
-The Marquis.
-Yeah.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.859
Okay. George J. Mallory.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.153
It was the Visa card.
I knew it. He's from St. Louis.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.656
-Stan, hold onto our prisoners, will you?
-Yeah, right.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.826
-Norm. A minute?
-Hey. Uh-huh.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.287
A few moments ago,
a Heights detective was here.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.289
-Yeah, Donahue.
-What'd he want?

35:25.873 --> 35:26.916
Personal thing.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.877
Did it have anything to do
with the Delaberto homicide?

35:29.961 --> 35:34.340
-The Heights asking for information?
-No, nothing like that.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.718
I don't like surprises, Norman.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.096
You won't get any.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.683
I got some paperwork. Can I get caught up?

35:52.150 --> 35:55.903
Excuse me. Did you handle a call
this morning about a jumper on Culver?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.613
-Yes, sir.
-Who did you give it to?

35:57.697 --> 35:59.532
Lieutenant Goldblume. He takes them.

35:59.615 --> 36:01.117
And did you give it to him right away?

36:01.200 --> 36:02.994
As soon as he was off the phone.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.579
He was on the phone for a while.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.206
Thank you.

36:12.461 --> 36:14.255
I'm ready for duty, Lieutenant.

36:18.926 --> 36:20.887
-Oh, my God.
-What?

36:22.305 --> 36:23.973
-Ballantine.
-Do I shame you?

36:24.056 --> 36:25.433
No, just stay calm.

36:25.516 --> 36:28.019
Pick the one that offends you.
Any except the thumb.

36:31.522 --> 36:33.691
(speaking Japanese)

36:40.364 --> 36:41.991
Remember us, Mr. Mallory?

36:42.074 --> 36:43.492
Uh, not exactly.

36:44.493 --> 36:47.455
Maybe you were too busy
pulling up your pants.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.791
Sir, we risked our lives this morning
getting the people who were robbing you.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.960
-Then you split on us.
-I'm sorry.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.462
I am sorry about that,

36:54.545 --> 36:57.673
but I had conferences
scheduled all day long,

36:57.757 --> 36:59.967
and I knew I couldn't afford
the court appearances.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.136
Well, now that your busy day is over,
Mr. Mallory,

37:02.220 --> 37:04.388
maybe you could just come down
and sign a complaint.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.224
-No.
-You'd really help us out.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.476
No. I'm sorry.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.686
I'm going back to St. Louis
tomorrow night anyway.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.104
Okay, then just give us an hour.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.439
We just need the threat of you

37:13.522 --> 37:15.650
to get one of those people
to confess to something.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.985
I'm due at a reception in an hour.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.529
Really, I'm from out of town.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.115
It is my choice, last I heard.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.826
The only thing about that, Mr. Mallory, is

37:25.910 --> 37:27.912
you go back to St. Louis
and we still got a case.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.163
We still have your address.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.957
We're gonna send a subpoena to your home.

37:31.040 --> 37:31.958
No, no, no.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.334
Or call you up.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.836
If you're not at work,
ring you at your house.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.547
"Could you leave a message
for a Mr. George Mallory?

37:38.631 --> 37:41.717
We're trying to reach him as a witness
in people vs. Jacqueline Lowrie,

37:41.801 --> 37:44.011
charged with prostitution and robbery."

37:44.971 --> 37:46.222
You wouldn't.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.976
Mr. Mallory, that would be our job.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.147
(sighs) One hour?

37:56.232 --> 37:58.651
Well, now, that could end up being two,

37:58.734 --> 38:01.195
but that only would be
because of rush-hour traffic.

38:06.534 --> 38:09.370
(exhales) You should have kept
your pants on, George.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.126
(telephone ringing)

38:15.209 --> 38:17.420
Captain, those amended reports
are on your desk.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.965
-Who's this?
-John from this morning.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.092
Gonna try and shed some light on events.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.887
-Mine? This one?
-Do it.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.140
Would you stay here with the sergeant,
Mr. Mallory?

38:35.521 --> 38:37.773
We're doing a kind of reverse lineup here,
Maurice.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.525
You see that guy over there?

38:39.608 --> 38:41.193
-What guy?
-That guy by the desk?

38:41.277 --> 38:43.696
He's starting to fill out complaint forms?

38:44.280 --> 38:45.656
I never seen the man before.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.075
Hey, white johns all look alike, I know.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.453
But see, that's the guy
you hit on this morning.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.371
And you've got
between five and two minutes

38:52.455 --> 38:53.831
to come up with an alternative,

38:53.914 --> 38:56.208
or he's gonna put you
back in Harrisonville.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.126
Say what?

38:57.209 --> 38:59.587
Oh, you don't understand me?

38:59.670 --> 39:01.589
We checked with your parole guy.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.632
And with a victim,
your chance of a violation

39:03.716 --> 39:05.301
goes up from 60% to 100%.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.970
Go away.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.681
Your choice, fella.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.644
No, I will not pay the closing costs.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.438
They wanted the place,
they can pay them.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.939
And my moving costs.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.858
Sir, could I ask you about something?

39:21.692 --> 39:22.568
Sure. What's that?

39:22.651 --> 39:25.321
A khaki officer told me
it took him five minutes

39:25.404 --> 39:28.366
this morning before he could alert you
to the situation on Culver.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.950
Because you were on the phone, sir,

39:30.034 --> 39:32.078
about your real estate or something.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.248
You mean, so it's my fault the guy jumped?

39:36.332 --> 39:39.543
No, sir, but without those five minutes,
you would've been there.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.879
I got to tell you guys,
I think that's one of the lamest,

39:41.962 --> 39:43.422
dumbest excuses I've ever heard.

39:43.506 --> 39:46.801
Oh, I don't think
it's that lame, Lieutenant.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.178
Could we talk privately for a minute?

39:50.346 --> 39:51.263
Sure thing.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.518
(telephone ringing)

40:01.482 --> 40:03.859
I'd like to see Lieutenant Buntz.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.033
Could we put away ranks here, Lieutenant?

40:11.117 --> 40:12.701
Because I gotta know what's going on.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.161
What do you mean?

40:15.538 --> 40:18.165
I've known Officer Lipsky a day,

40:18.249 --> 40:21.627
but he seems to me to be
a hardworking, pretty courageous guy.

40:22.294 --> 40:24.004
So why are you sandbagging him?

40:25.673 --> 40:27.174
In fact, Stan, it was your khaki

40:27.258 --> 40:30.010
who failed to inform me
that we had an emergency situation.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.429
Now you're getting me real mad.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.305
Blaming everybody except yourself.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.850
What's the matter with you
the last couple of days?

40:35.933 --> 40:37.852
You feeling guilty about making a profit

40:37.935 --> 40:39.812
on that slum of yours,
now you can't stand it?

40:39.895 --> 40:41.981
-That's out of line.
-Don't you "out of line" me.

40:42.064 --> 40:43.816
I hear you yelling
on the phone about money

40:43.899 --> 40:45.776
like you're embarrassed
that you got a break.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.820
I've known you two years,

40:47.903 --> 40:50.364
and I've never seen you
put a mark on a guy.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.159
So you talk to me about being out of line

40:53.242 --> 40:55.744
when you stop taking out
private crap on my men.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.666
Your dough got you in a funk, Lieutenant?

41:01.500 --> 41:02.835
Why don't you give it away?

41:03.586 --> 41:05.087
Give it to some black people.

41:06.422 --> 41:08.048
Well, I bet Bobby Hill would take it.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.925
Neal Washington.

41:15.723 --> 41:16.765
(door slam)

41:18.684 --> 41:20.227
(telephone ringing)

41:20.311 --> 41:22.146
So he wants you to say
you were with him, huh?

41:22.229 --> 41:24.231
I'd do anything for him, but I can't lie.

41:24.773 --> 41:26.901
-I'm not good at it.
-Listen, you got anybody,

41:26.984 --> 41:29.987
a relative, a friend,
anybody that lives out of town?

41:30.070 --> 41:31.363
My mom lives in St. Paul.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.615
Good. Here.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.075
You get on a bus and you go see her, okay?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.494
Just leave him?

41:36.577 --> 41:39.872
He asked you to commit a crime,
Mary, perjury. It's a felony.

41:40.789 --> 41:42.875
You won't tell him I told you about it?

41:42.958 --> 41:44.919
Just get on a bus and visit your mom,
all right?

41:45.002 --> 41:47.755
There's nothing you or me or anybody
can do for Tommy now.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.925
Tick-tock, officers.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.094
Sergeant Bates, Officer McBride,
guy wants you.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.596
-The pimp?
-Yeah.

41:55.679 --> 41:56.931
Okay. Hold on. Just...

42:02.728 --> 42:04.438
-So, what's up?
-If I, um...

42:04.522 --> 42:07.233
If things lighten up for this woman here,
what happens then?

42:07.316 --> 42:09.527
-What do you mean what happens?
-Case go away?

42:09.985 --> 42:10.986
We already told you, no.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.781
I mean,
at least the dude disappears, right?

42:16.659 --> 42:19.328
-There's a good chance.
-Hey, I don't need good chances.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.041
-Okay. He's a goner.
-You gonna talk to your lady

42:24.124 --> 42:25.626
-when we bring her up here?
-No need.

42:25.709 --> 42:26.627
How's that?

42:26.710 --> 42:29.213
I told her what to say.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.757
I told her what to lie, okay?

42:31.840 --> 42:32.800
Get his statement.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.722
Ron, Mike.

42:38.806 --> 42:39.682
Lieutenant.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.811
-I'm pulling that jacket entry, Ron.
-Lieutenant?

42:43.894 --> 42:46.021
The short answer is
I should have got there in time.

42:47.106 --> 42:50.734
-I appreciate the rhythm, sir.
-You had guts going out there.

42:51.777 --> 42:53.320
I've lost a couple guys myself.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.241
Hey, Lieutenant, heard about your score.
Nice going.

42:57.324 --> 42:59.159
Next time,
let me buy in with you, all right?

42:59.243 --> 43:00.202
All right.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.205
-Night.
-Night, Henry.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.082
Oh, Henry, what happened with your house?

43:06.000 --> 43:09.378
Sold it, cleaned up.
Donald Trump of the Hill.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.548
-Henry.
-Small bout of self-pity.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.467
Small bout of missing some jokes.

43:16.468 --> 43:18.262
I've been thinking a lot about Gina.

43:18.804 --> 43:19.930
It's a year today.

43:21.473 --> 43:24.435
Stan straightened me out
about a couple of things, anyway.

43:25.686 --> 43:27.479
(indistinct chatter)

43:30.107 --> 43:31.567
(telephone ringing)

43:35.404 --> 43:36.280
Lucy.

43:36.780 --> 43:37.615
What?

43:37.698 --> 43:38.616
What do you think?

43:39.158 --> 43:40.200
About what?

43:40.659 --> 43:42.328
About what you learned about me today?

43:42.953 --> 43:44.663
Oh, I don't know.

43:45.914 --> 43:48.626
I guess different strokes, you know.

43:50.669 --> 43:52.379
Do you think we should still be partners?

43:52.463 --> 43:54.423
I know this is just temporary, but...

43:55.549 --> 43:56.550
Why not?

43:57.051 --> 44:00.095
I don't want any implications
coming up, for your sake.

44:00.179 --> 44:02.056
There's not gonna be any implications.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.434
I mean, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

44:05.517 --> 44:07.519
There's no reason
anybody should know about it.

44:08.562 --> 44:10.814
You stood up for me today. Thank you.

44:15.152 --> 44:19.239
You know, there is one thing I'd like
to say to you just as a sergeant.

44:19.907 --> 44:22.743
You are what you are, and you're a cop.

44:22.826 --> 44:24.912
Don't be taking suspects down to the pier.

44:24.995 --> 44:28.207
Other cops, no, that's dumb.

44:29.583 --> 44:30.876
You're right. Forget it.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.128
I'm not other cops.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.383
Good night, Katie.

44:39.885 --> 44:41.095
See ya, Sarge.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.223
I have seen so much weakness,

44:44.306 --> 44:46.183
such levels of betrayal and deceit

44:46.266 --> 44:48.560
as would break the spirit of a lesser man.

44:49.228 --> 44:51.188
But fortunately,

44:51.271 --> 44:53.691
I recognize adversity for what it is.

44:54.274 --> 44:57.444
You see, my little puppy dog,
I'm only being tested.

44:58.153 --> 45:01.198
I am certain that all that has happened

45:01.281 --> 45:03.867
is but the overture
to enormous sweeping changes

45:03.951 --> 45:05.994
that will soon engulf my life.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.415
If only I knew what they were.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.085
Perhaps you know.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.006
My one and only friend. Tell me.

45:19.174 --> 45:20.342
I love you.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.513
Yes. Yes. I wuv you.

45:35.023 --> 45:36.150
(door slam)

45:40.612 --> 45:43.031
(tires screech)

45:52.624 --> 45:55.127
-(gun cocks)
-(pants)

45:55.210 --> 45:57.212
It ain't gonna work, Donahue!

45:57.296 --> 45:58.589
It won't go down!

46:02.926 --> 46:05.888
If it's a matter of you and me, it's gonna
be you, don't you know that?

46:07.723 --> 46:08.849
TOMMY: Guido!

46:10.434 --> 46:12.936
The things I gotta do just to talk to you.

46:13.479 --> 46:14.938
Come on. Let me buy you a drink.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.316
(chuckles) Yeah, sure.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.735
TOMMY: I'm hiding in the dark.

46:20.277 --> 46:21.737
You're hiding in the dark.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.406
Just like when we were kids, remember?

46:25.783 --> 46:27.159
Yeah, I remember.

46:29.161 --> 46:31.455
TOMMY:
<i>♪ I'll come out if you'll come out ♪</i>

46:34.541 --> 46:35.876
All right. You first.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.254
Hands up, under the lights.

46:39.963 --> 46:41.298
TOMMY: You got it.

46:48.096 --> 46:51.225
Here he comes, big as life.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.940
Here I am, ready or not.

46:58.023 --> 47:00.067
(suspenseful music plays)

47:06.323 --> 47:07.741
-(shot)
-No!

47:07.825 --> 47:09.576
(dramatic music plays)

47:15.833 --> 47:18.961
(panting)

47:19.795 --> 47:21.630
You're really dumb, you know that, Tommy?

47:21.713 --> 47:23.674
Just a dumb mick.

47:23.757 --> 47:25.467
Yeah, I know.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.386
What am I gonna do about that?

47:29.096 --> 47:30.264
Am I gonna die?

47:32.516 --> 47:34.101
It don't look good, Tommy.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.854
Think you can get me a priest?

47:37.688 --> 47:39.147
You know how my mother is.

47:40.482 --> 47:43.318
I don't know. I'll try.

47:46.280 --> 47:49.992
I'm a police officer. Somebody call 911.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.077
(melancholic music plays)

48:02.546 --> 48:04.548
(theme music playing)
