00:51.680 --> 00:53.339
Kim Na Na.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.378
Kim Na Na.

00:58.050 --> 00:59.141
Why?

01:00.878 --> 01:02.014
Why?

01:04.287 --> 01:07.628
You saved me.

01:08.947 --> 01:10.801
Twice, even.

01:14.359 --> 01:19.104
Did you... hurt this much too?

01:20.631 --> 01:22.286
Don't talk.

01:23.029 --> 01:24.665
Don't say a word.

01:26.774 --> 01:31.647
Did you hate me?

01:35.512 --> 01:39.657
I'd like it if you say you didn't.

01:46.006 --> 01:51.061
I wanted... to say thank you.

01:52.534 --> 01:55.261
Why did you run in and get shot?!

01:55.381 --> 01:57.793
Why did you run in and get shot?!

01:58.939 --> 02:03.438
Thank goodness it wasn't you.

02:10.454 --> 02:11.436
Kim Na Na.

02:11.556 --> 02:12.654
Kim Na Na.

02:13.454 --> 02:14.509
Kim Na Na.

02:18.141 --> 02:19.559
Kim Na Na!

02:20.904 --> 02:22.123
Kim Na Na!

02:35.044 --> 02:38.117
Yoon Sung!
I'm going to kill them!

02:38.871 --> 02:41.279
What happened?
Where's Na Na?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.515
Yoon Sung. Yoon Sung!

02:45.661 --> 02:46.861
Na Na.

02:47.339 --> 02:49.176
Na Na! Na Na!

02:50.139 --> 02:51.530
What happened to Na Na?

02:51.650 --> 02:53.285
Is she dead?
Yoon Sung.

02:53.405 --> 02:54.703
Yoon Sung!

02:54.823 --> 02:56.400
What do we do now, Yoon Sung?!

02:56.520 --> 02:59.691
Just a sec. I'll call the Director.
Yes, call her.

03:00.618 --> 03:03.236
Just a sec, Na Na.
Hold on just a sec.

03:03.356 --> 03:06.672
Hello?!
Hello, this is the Director, right?

03:06.792 --> 03:10.460
We're going to go there right now.
Are you at the hospital?

03:10.580 --> 03:12.478
Yes, we're going right now.
Please wait a little!

03:13.278 --> 03:15.660
You said you caught them; what happened?!

03:17.042 --> 03:20.168
It couldn't be... the City Hunter?

03:36.377 --> 03:38.586
- Close the blinds, please.
- Ah, yes.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.360
Are you awake?

03:54.506 --> 03:56.488
Are you not going to get treated?

04:00.216 --> 04:01.598
A gunshot wound again?

04:08.294 --> 04:10.258
She has lost too much blood.

04:11.967 --> 04:14.240
Her blood pressure and pulse are really bad.

04:14.858 --> 04:17.240
You need to go to a hospital immediately.
It's dangerous!

04:17.360 --> 04:18.290
No, Unni.

04:18.410 --> 04:21.745
This is an animal hospital,
not a place where human lives are saved!

04:21.865 --> 04:24.108
You know what will happen if we go, Unni.

04:24.228 --> 04:28.183
Your blood loss is too severe.
There's no blood available here.

04:30.129 --> 04:31.365
Draw blood from me and give it to her.

04:31.485 --> 04:33.328
- What?
- I'm type O.

04:33.448 --> 04:35.819
Take as much as you can and save Na Na.

04:35.939 --> 04:39.110
- That could put you in danger too!
- I'm okay.

04:42.521 --> 04:45.867
Save Na Na.

05:22.726 --> 05:24.781
I'm going to operate
and take the lodged bullet out.

05:24.901 --> 05:26.999
Take a little nap.

05:30.071 --> 05:31.344
Lee Yoon Sung.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.908
Don't talk.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.568
It will tire you out.

05:34.950 --> 05:37.368
Don't worry about me.

05:38.090 --> 05:40.835
You know I'm tough.

05:41.835 --> 05:43.090
Kim Na Na.

06:33.553 --> 06:34.699
Yoon Sung.

06:35.826 --> 06:37.062
Get some rest.

06:37.182 --> 06:39.153
Your body is not even fully healed,

06:39.273 --> 06:42.196
and you gave all that blood.
You're going to collapse.

06:42.542 --> 06:43.960
What kind of girl is she?

06:44.080 --> 06:45.051
Who?

06:45.171 --> 06:46.178
Na Na?

06:46.298 --> 06:47.996
Why does she have no fear?

06:48.560 --> 06:50.942
She looks just like a regular girl,

06:51.062 --> 06:53.047
but she doesn't back down,

06:53.847 --> 06:55.447
and doesn't place any value
on her own body.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.592
She's a strong girl.

06:58.374 --> 07:02.474
She's strong. That's why she has been able
to survive on her own like this.

07:02.972 --> 07:06.808
Without me,
do you think she'll still be able to live fine?

07:07.336 --> 07:09.572
People who are survivors all live.

07:10.281 --> 07:13.072
Because that's life.
Look at me.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.599
I'm living fine even without Huay Ni.

07:17.617 --> 07:18.817
I...

07:21.078 --> 07:23.987
don't think I can anymore.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.070
Put me down.

07:36.507 --> 07:39.125
Why did you bring me here
instead of my house?

07:39.245 --> 07:41.560
Kim Jong Shik kidnapped you.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.153
Do you think you'll be safe at home?

07:43.354 --> 07:46.524
My legs are fine.

07:50.532 --> 07:52.078
Covers...

07:59.793 --> 08:01.939
Don't go to work for the time-being either.

08:02.059 --> 08:04.563
Kim Jong Shik is certain to know
your position as an agent.

08:04.881 --> 08:06.282
Yoon Sung, just a second.

08:07.982 --> 08:09.072
Hello?

08:09.192 --> 08:11.072
This is the Presidential Security Service,
right?

08:11.192 --> 08:13.705
About Agent Kim Na Na...

08:14.432 --> 08:17.505
She got a cast on her arm and I don't think
she'll be able to come in for a while.

08:17.625 --> 08:20.250
Ah, well she wasn't hurt too badly.
Don't worry.

08:20.798 --> 08:23.380
Yes, yes.
Please handle it that way.

08:25.016 --> 08:27.580
I'm Na Na's uncle.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.301
Yes, yes. Yes.

08:32.318 --> 08:35.227
Now then, the Presidential Security Service
is taken cared of.

08:35.601 --> 08:37.964
Na Na, what kind of rice porridge
do you like?

08:38.083 --> 08:41.546
Abalone, seafood, red bean, mung bean?

08:41.666 --> 08:44.414
Just give her anything. The only time
she doesn't eat is when there's no food.

08:44.534 --> 08:46.523
Be nice to her, she's hurt.

08:46.941 --> 08:48.123
Don't you know me?

08:48.243 --> 08:50.686
I'm being really nice to her right now.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.446
I'll go get some clothes.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.555
What?

08:53.675 --> 08:55.591
Yoon Sung, I... I can go get some.

08:55.711 --> 08:56.682
Yoon Sung.

09:02.719 --> 09:06.202
Why on earth did you do that back then?

09:07.711 --> 09:11.093
I was on probation for gambling back then.

09:11.529 --> 09:13.911
Kim Jong Shik knew that
and used it to threaten me.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.029
If I didn't change my testimony,

09:16.149 --> 09:19.065
he would fabricate a crime I didn't commit
and have me sent to jail.

09:19.185 --> 09:23.014
So... you lied.

09:23.668 --> 09:25.032
I'm sorry.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.541
To make up for it,
really...

09:28.661 --> 09:31.486
I'll lead the way to help Yoon Sung
bring Kim Jong Shik to justice.

09:32.027 --> 09:34.390
Really, even if I have to risk my life...

09:34.510 --> 09:37.900
Truly, even by risking my life,
I'll lead the way.

09:39.790 --> 09:42.318
And how did you get to know Lee Yoon Sung?

09:43.291 --> 09:46.200
Yoon Sung saved me when we were in Thailand.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.564
When Yoon Sung first came to Korea,
I asked him to look after you.

09:50.909 --> 09:53.847
I always felt troubled about you.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.356
Ah, Na Na.

09:59.810 --> 10:01.128
I have beef bones soup.

10:01.248 --> 10:03.801
I'll make you some tasty rice porridge
with bones soup after I change my clothes.

10:03.921 --> 10:05.819
Wait just a bit.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.383
The money isn't moving yet.

10:21.503 --> 10:24.492
Really? Was there really
200 billion won in that room?

10:24.819 --> 10:26.492
Yeah.
It was full.

10:26.612 --> 10:28.510
Is that his money?!

10:28.630 --> 10:30.473
Why take tuition money
and keep it at his house?

10:30.593 --> 10:33.005
That means he has taken it for himself
and the school can't even use it!

10:33.125 --> 10:35.696
He's basically using the school
as his personal money maker.

10:36.424 --> 10:38.260
And the scholarship he established
that he boasts about

10:38.380 --> 10:42.100
paid out less to fewer students
than other schools.

10:42.446 --> 10:44.973
He's bad, really bad.

10:45.337 --> 10:48.282
He's feeding off from children who want
to learn and parents who want them taught?

10:48.402 --> 10:51.191
We ought to tear his insides out! Ay!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.127
I should just read.

10:54.247 --> 10:56.127
I'm going to read...

10:58.945 --> 11:00.545
You're going to read a home shopping catalog?

11:00.665 --> 11:02.863
Of course!
You know how interesting this is?!

11:17.715 --> 11:19.006
Yoon Sung.

11:19.829 --> 11:20.847
What?

11:21.593 --> 11:22.665
What?

11:41.521 --> 11:45.467
Seeing how Kim Na Na
took a bullet for Yoon Sung,

11:45.587 --> 11:48.231
I don't think their relationship
is just casual.

12:03.785 --> 12:06.858
I told him over and over again not to love.

12:08.422 --> 12:09.749
There's no choice.

12:09.869 --> 12:12.222
If Yoon Sung can't end it himself,

12:12.342 --> 12:14.688
I have no choice but to help.

12:16.106 --> 12:18.124
I'll take care of Kim Na Na.

12:18.244 --> 12:21.543
- By "take care of," you mean...
- I have to get rid of her.

12:21.663 --> 12:23.913
What happened to Kyung Hee?

12:25.695 --> 12:27.405
From the Seoul area all the way to Gyeonggi-do,

12:27.415 --> 12:30.677
I looked for Lee Kyung Hee
in all the hospital registries, but...

12:30.797 --> 12:31.988
she's nowhere to be found.

12:32.108 --> 12:34.242
Find her even if you have
to search the entire country.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.551
Before Yoon Sung finds out she's gone...

12:36.671 --> 12:37.588
Yes.

12:39.928 --> 12:41.055
But...

12:42.310 --> 12:46.800
Isn't telling her Yoon Sung was dead...
going too far?

12:46.920 --> 12:50.438
She has already gone through quite a shock
because of her illness.

12:50.558 --> 12:51.856
What are you talking about?

12:51.976 --> 12:53.801
And frankly, Yoon Sung too...

12:54.801 --> 12:59.265
He lost his father because of those 5,
and grew up pitiful without a mother.

12:59.285 --> 13:02.858
- Can't he meet his mother now and...?
- Don't be so soft!

13:03.203 --> 13:06.076
When I took him away from his mother...

13:08.512 --> 13:11.840
I already crossed
a river I can't cross back.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.658
You took him away?

13:13.778 --> 13:16.076
Lee Kyung Hee didn't abandon him?

13:16.196 --> 13:19.858
Why tell Yoon Sung such a lie?

13:29.035 --> 13:30.344
Yoon Sung.

13:41.301 --> 13:43.683
You told me she abandoned me.

13:46.828 --> 13:47.956
Why?

13:50.610 --> 13:51.716
Why did you say that?

13:51.836 --> 13:54.262
Because that is our destiny.

13:56.862 --> 14:00.443
Me because I alone lived
in the waters off of Nampo,

14:00.807 --> 14:03.143
and you because you are Moo Yul's son.

14:08.179 --> 14:11.307
If I hadn't taken you 28 years ago,

14:13.631 --> 14:17.358
I suppose I would be living a normal life.

14:17.904 --> 14:20.067
Any moment I felt I was going soft,

14:20.187 --> 14:23.852
any moment I wanted to forget about revenge
and just live my life,

14:25.670 --> 14:28.215
I'd look at you each time,

14:28.335 --> 14:32.726
and the memory of Moo Yul's and my comrades'
dying moment comes to my mind.

14:32.846 --> 14:34.071
Looking at you,

14:34.191 --> 14:37.599
I see my 20 comrades every night.

14:41.209 --> 14:44.154
You took a fledgling from his mother,

14:44.554 --> 14:46.936
and you say it's because of revenge?

14:48.599 --> 14:51.527
You wreck my life like this,

14:52.472 --> 14:54.963
and you say it's because of revenge?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.380
I didn't want to live like this!

15:01.016 --> 15:05.962
Even to the day I die,
I can never forgive you, Father!

15:09.118 --> 15:11.863
We have a job to do right now.

15:12.482 --> 15:13.845
Don't forget that.

15:13.965 --> 15:18.710
I will carry out my father's revenge
on my own.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.964
You said it would be war, didn't you?

15:22.437 --> 15:23.855
I won't avoid that war.

15:23.975 --> 15:25.164
Yoon Sung.

15:26.372 --> 15:28.172
You can't beat me.

15:28.292 --> 15:29.772
You're wrong.

15:30.372 --> 15:32.718
It's you, Father, who can never beat me.

15:34.318 --> 15:39.419
Shik Joong ahjussi, Mother,
and Na Na...

15:40.673 --> 15:44.164
If you lay a finger on the
3 people who are precious to me,

15:45.019 --> 15:47.655
I will risk my life and not leave you alone.

15:48.932 --> 15:50.878
This, Father...

15:53.223 --> 15:55.260
is my final warning.

15:59.891 --> 16:02.673
Still, you call me Father.

16:37.049 --> 16:40.218
You seem young, but you're a doctor?

16:40.509 --> 16:42.982
Whoever your parents are,
they must be very proud of you.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.182
You should just get on his back.

16:45.302 --> 16:49.418
Your mother must be proud
to have a strong son like you.

16:49.774 --> 16:51.938
<i>It's myelogenous leukemia.</i>

16:52.058 --> 16:55.647
<i>The patient can die,
waiting for a bone marrow match.</i>

17:26.170 --> 17:27.933
I'm leaving.

17:29.551 --> 17:32.984
If my house is dangerous,
then I can stay with Sae Hee unni.

17:35.148 --> 17:37.584
I'll mail your clothes back.

17:37.704 --> 17:40.857
Just throw away my bloody clothes.

17:48.292 --> 17:52.528
I'd like it if you don't quit working
at the Blue House because of me.

17:53.455 --> 17:56.073
You liked working on the
Communications Network Team.

17:57.910 --> 18:02.509
Now, I really will disappear from your life.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.000
I promise.

18:05.509 --> 18:08.855
I'll go back to the time before we met.

18:12.191 --> 18:16.469
I was paying back
the debt from when you saved me,

18:16.760 --> 18:18.642
so don't think too much of it.

18:31.155 --> 18:32.701
Don't go.

18:34.341 --> 18:35.414
Please.

18:39.804 --> 18:40.877
Don't go.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.246
Moo Yul,

20:18.010 --> 20:20.810
the men who betrayed us...

20:21.828 --> 20:24.610
I'll take revenge on them to the end.

20:26.215 --> 20:29.506
Those who get in the way of my revenge,

20:31.087 --> 20:33.415
I will kill them all,

20:35.215 --> 20:36.651
even if

20:38.960 --> 20:42.142
it's Lee Yoon Sung.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.738
If the so-called City Hunter
came into this room,

21:07.047 --> 21:09.532
he could have seen this vault.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.114
So nerve-wracking...

21:23.696 --> 21:24.478
Mark.

21:25.042 --> 21:25.915
Mark.

21:30.169 --> 21:33.365
The guy you caught in this room...
I'm sure you remember him?

21:33.485 --> 21:35.129
I remember him clearly.

21:35.249 --> 21:38.402
Bring Kim Na Na and Bae Man Deok
to me again.

21:39.567 --> 21:43.476
If it's not a coincidence and the
City Hunter is connected to them somehow,

21:43.858 --> 21:45.585
he might show up again.

21:45.705 --> 21:49.240
We don't really know where
Bae Man Deok is currently living.

21:50.905 --> 21:56.305
And Kim Na Na is a Presidential Security
Service agent at the Blue House.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.505
What?

21:59.069 --> 22:01.024
A Presidential Security Service agent?

22:09.097 --> 22:12.059
We have to put a new dressing on it,
if you don't want it to get infected.

22:16.987 --> 22:19.750
But, do you know how to do it?

22:20.500 --> 22:21.736
I've learned.

22:21.856 --> 22:23.918
Since I had to learn how to do
pretty much everything in order to survive.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.809
How in the world did you live
all those years?

22:29.936 --> 22:34.713
When you lived there, didn't you have
any friends other than Bae Man Deok?

22:35.077 --> 22:36.586
I did.

22:36.706 --> 22:38.695
There was one who was a lot like you.

22:38.815 --> 22:39.695
Really?

22:40.095 --> 22:41.132
Yeah.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.346
Trusting, physically strong,
loved to eat,

22:45.466 --> 22:48.073
and particularly loved it
when I touched her.

22:49.764 --> 22:50.655
Unbelievable...

22:50.775 --> 22:53.102
It's true I'm trusting,
physically strong, and love to eat,

22:53.222 --> 22:55.247
but I don't appreciate skinship.

22:55.367 --> 22:57.811
Except of course,
for unusual circumstances like this.

22:57.931 --> 22:59.993
I get it.
Don't move.

23:01.229 --> 23:04.283
You still don't know where Ajumeoni is,
do you?

23:05.511 --> 23:07.974
Didn't they say she needed a transplant
within a month?

23:08.094 --> 23:09.883
I'll find her.

23:10.003 --> 23:12.083
I will absolutely find her.

23:12.637 --> 23:15.255
She has to stay well until then.

23:15.582 --> 23:17.582
All done.
Put on your clothes.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.419
If you interfere without any fear
one more time then your dead!

23:23.889 --> 23:26.853
Is that something to say
to someone who saved your life?

23:27.471 --> 23:29.371
Stay here for the time-being.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.444
Kim Jong Shik is probably
looking for you and Ahjussi.

23:32.753 --> 23:35.371
Don't go out and complicate things more,

23:35.491 --> 23:36.844
and just listen to me.

23:36.964 --> 23:38.402
All right?

23:38.766 --> 23:43.166
Um...
Are you going to punish Kim Jong Shik?

23:43.675 --> 23:45.311
Bae Man Deok ahjussi said earlier,

23:45.431 --> 23:47.784
that there was 200 billion won
in that house.

23:48.230 --> 23:49.721
It's nothing
you need to concern yourself about.

23:49.841 --> 23:51.412
I'll help you.

23:51.532 --> 23:54.448
Kim Jong Shik owes me a big debt too.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.776
Can you really not distinguish
where you should and shouldn't get involved?

23:58.176 --> 23:59.518
Let me get involved.

23:59.638 --> 24:02.136
Kim Jong Shik is my foe too.

24:02.699 --> 24:03.554
Kim Na Na.

24:03.674 --> 24:07.390
I'm not letting you continue to do
dangerous things on your own anymore.

24:21.558 --> 24:24.558
Aigoo, it was hard to mix with one hand.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.177
What are you doing?

24:28.049 --> 24:29.231
Kim Na Na.

24:29.351 --> 24:31.867
Oh, it's Myung Mun University's Ledger.

24:31.987 --> 24:33.958
Then, are you looking for
traces of Kim Jong Shik's corruption?

24:34.078 --> 24:36.449
- Kim Na Na, you really...
- Let's work on it together.

24:36.569 --> 24:38.976
No, wait.
You have to find Ajumeoni too, don't you?

24:40.031 --> 24:44.197
Then, I'll look for Ajumeoni,
so hack into each hospital's website.

24:44.317 --> 24:45.597
I'll look for her for you.

24:45.717 --> 24:47.797
Her name is Lee Kyung Hee.

24:47.917 --> 24:49.943
What year was she born?

24:50.125 --> 24:51.670
I told you to stay out of it.

24:56.068 --> 24:58.486
I'm worried about Ajumeoni too.

24:58.606 --> 25:00.050
She's sick.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.466
I hacked into the health
insurance assessment database.

25:14.586 --> 25:18.121
This is a list of each hospital's
health insurance claims,

25:18.394 --> 25:20.694
so if she has checked in somewhere,
we should be able to find her.

25:20.814 --> 25:23.185
This much, I think I can do.

25:23.305 --> 25:24.658
Yup!

25:35.059 --> 25:38.096
How is it
that as soon as Lee Yoon Sung resigned,

25:38.216 --> 25:40.599
she broke her arm and went to the hospital?

25:41.454 --> 25:45.326
Do you think maybe they planned it
and went off to play somewhere?

25:45.446 --> 25:47.054
Something smells fishy here, doesn't it?

25:47.174 --> 25:47.999
Right?

25:48.119 --> 25:50.446
Hey, do you know how high
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung's taste in women is?

25:50.566 --> 25:52.464
Agent Kim Na Na is really not it.

25:52.584 --> 25:55.128
Occasionally when he's with Da Hye,

25:55.148 --> 25:57.864
he looks over
with a strange look in his eyes.

25:59.319 --> 26:01.541
Oh, my gosh!
Is it me?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.523
It must be me!

26:03.643 --> 26:05.105
Oh, silly bear...

26:05.225 --> 26:07.159
He was looking at you?

26:07.468 --> 26:10.823
Wow, just because Dr. Lee is
a little bit good-looking, isn't that too much?

26:10.943 --> 26:12.695
What do you mean too much?

26:12.815 --> 26:16.659
It's just a man with superior genes
recognizing a quality woman.

26:16.779 --> 26:18.168
Hey, Agent Shin!

26:18.732 --> 26:23.913
Wasn't it not so long ago that you were
calling me cute and touching my cheek?

26:24.033 --> 26:26.477
- Now, you've changed your mind?
- Oh my my my my my!

26:26.597 --> 26:30.209
You're really overreacting
to a simple touch on the cheek.

26:31.755 --> 26:33.661
What do you mean overreacting?!

26:33.781 --> 26:34.915
I...

26:37.279 --> 26:38.668
It's like I lost my innocence...

26:39.141 --> 26:41.068
- You were here.
- Yes, Chief!

26:41.188 --> 26:44.347
I'm trying to convince Dr. Lee Yoon Sung
to stay, but I can't call him.

26:44.382 --> 26:45.732
It says the number is not in service.

26:45.752 --> 26:48.123
So what are you going to do?

26:51.889 --> 26:55.198
Chief, are you sure this is the right place?

26:55.580 --> 26:58.471
His personnel file says
this is where he lives.

26:59.126 --> 27:03.198
Wow... It's totally a palace.

27:09.298 --> 27:10.734
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

27:10.854 --> 27:13.025
Oh... Is Dr. Lee Yoon Sung in?

27:15.734 --> 27:17.116
Who are they?

27:17.734 --> 27:20.298
Hey!
Go hide upstairs.

27:20.607 --> 27:23.189
And Ahjussi, be calm and cool.
You can't sweat, okay?

27:23.309 --> 27:25.343
Okay, what's the matter all of a sudden?
What?

27:29.834 --> 27:31.798
What brings you all the way here,
so suddenly?

27:33.825 --> 27:40.250
The reason we've come here
is you can't possibly resign.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.134
Chief.

27:41.169 --> 27:43.836
To someone who lives like this,
the Presidential Security Service salary

27:43.956 --> 27:46.017
is probably nothing,

27:46.137 --> 27:49.054
but for the country, just come to work
and think of it as devoted service.

27:49.174 --> 27:51.619
After you came, we blocked a DDOS* attack,
(*distributed denial of service)

27:51.739 --> 27:54.055
and blocked a hacking attempt.

27:54.175 --> 27:56.841
If the Communications Network
goes down again,

27:56.961 --> 27:58.586
it's really the end for our team.

27:58.706 --> 28:01.477
I blocked hacking attempts too, Chief.

28:02.059 --> 28:04.913
And you also aided a hacking attempt,
didn't you?

28:06.168 --> 28:08.375
I won't change my mind.

28:08.647 --> 28:11.138
If you're going to try to talk me into it,
then please go.

28:11.258 --> 28:14.738
No...
Until you say you're going to return,

28:14.858 --> 28:17.253
I absolutely won't leave this house,
I can't leave this house.

28:17.373 --> 28:18.599
Chief.

28:20.544 --> 28:23.472
Please have some fruits while you talk.

28:35.966 --> 28:38.475
Please have some fruits while you talk.

28:38.595 --> 28:40.951
What does your uncle think?

28:41.071 --> 28:44.224
Don't you think he should go back to work?

28:44.624 --> 28:50.530
Oh...
Our Yoon Sung is rather strong-minded.

28:59.052 --> 29:00.034
Dr. Lee.

29:00.154 --> 29:01.852
Come back to work.

29:01.972 --> 29:04.379
Will you?
Please...

29:04.499 --> 29:06.397
Kim Na Na isn't there.

29:06.517 --> 29:08.961
I'll throw you lightly during training.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.187
Okay?

29:10.207 --> 29:12.898
Excuse me.
Then who would I train with?

29:13.218 --> 29:14.972
I'm sure someone would train with you.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.845
And tutor Da Hye again.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.118
After you sent the text
that you couldn't anymore,

29:20.238 --> 29:23.972
she cried and cried
and made an unbelievable fuss.

29:24.506 --> 29:27.688
If that's the situation,
I can temporarily tutor...

29:28.216 --> 29:31.252
Know when to and when not to butt in.

29:32.670 --> 29:35.987
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung, your house is so nice.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.823
Show me around.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.187
- No.
- No! No!

29:39.307 --> 29:40.323
Not the house...

29:40.343 --> 29:42.405
I won't spread any rumors.
Ever...

29:42.525 --> 29:44.423
Show me around.

29:45.136 --> 29:47.046
Oh, I said that's not possible.

29:49.136 --> 29:50.318
Ah, Shin Eun Ah.

29:50.438 --> 29:52.336
Hey, we should...

29:52.456 --> 29:55.991
Wow!
All these... and belts.

29:56.438 --> 29:57.474
Ties.

30:02.442 --> 30:04.587
The best thing about the house
is the bathroom.

30:04.707 --> 30:07.260
- Have you ever seen a bath with jets?
- Really?

30:07.380 --> 30:09.296
I want to see.

30:15.644 --> 30:17.880
Aigoo. That devil of curiosity...

30:19.205 --> 30:21.187
Ay, ouch that hurts.

30:22.887 --> 30:26.687
It's pickled peppers that I made,
and marinated eel.

30:26.707 --> 30:29.787
And for Agent Shin Eun Ah,

30:30.277 --> 30:33.932
I packed some pomegranate extract
that is especially good for women.

30:35.738 --> 30:37.829
Oh, you really didn't have to.

30:37.949 --> 30:40.138
Chief, if you don't need it,
you can give it to me.

30:40.258 --> 30:43.120
I can eat all of these in a couple of days.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.847
Can't you even tell
when something is said out of thanks?

30:44.967 --> 30:46.164
The pomegranate extract...

30:46.284 --> 30:49.236
Lee Yoon Sung specially asked you
to pack it, right? For me?

30:49.356 --> 30:52.436
Agent, Yoon Sung doesn't
even know this stuff exists.

30:52.556 --> 30:56.691
I prepared it specially for you.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.069
Ah, I see.

30:59.189 --> 31:03.118
And I'll try to talk to Yoon Sung.

31:03.998 --> 31:05.600
Please go carefully.

31:05.755 --> 31:08.500
- Ah, then, we'll count on you.
- Of course.

31:08.773 --> 31:12.082
Agent, please go carefully.

31:15.991 --> 31:17.473
Then, go on back.

31:17.593 --> 31:19.764
- I'll be there in my car soon.
- Ah, yes.

31:19.884 --> 31:21.273
Goodbye.

31:22.909 --> 31:25.509
They say a woman's heart is capricious.

31:25.629 --> 31:28.656
We come to this house, and yours
has totally blown away, totally blown away.

31:29.965 --> 31:32.456
Doenjang Girl (*likes expensive things,
especially name brand imports).

31:32.802 --> 31:33.983
Materialistic!

31:38.448 --> 31:40.175
Hey, Go Ki Joon!

31:42.466 --> 31:44.848
How can she be so pretty?

31:44.968 --> 31:47.575
Whoa... My heart almost burst.

31:50.030 --> 31:52.894
That 200 billion won
that Kim Jong Shik has hidden...

31:53.014 --> 31:55.759
So Yoon Sung has put a tracking device in it.

31:56.429 --> 31:58.380
We'll have to take it when it moves.

31:59.286 --> 32:02.821
What exactly is the reason
we have to take that money?

32:03.111 --> 32:05.250
We're not doing this for money, are we?

32:05.370 --> 32:07.770
We'll have to send it to Kim Young Joo.

32:07.890 --> 32:12.841
Let's see how he deals with the money
his father stole from the university...

32:12.961 --> 32:15.070
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo?

32:16.140 --> 32:19.771
It will be fun to watch
whatever trap he falls into.

32:20.042 --> 32:24.157
If Kim Young Joo acts with his prosecutor
conscience and exposes his father,

32:24.277 --> 32:26.514
it will be fun to watch.

32:26.634 --> 32:31.282
And if by any chance,
he returns the money to protect his father,

32:31.402 --> 32:34.110
then it will also be fun
to see the whole country find out

32:34.230 --> 32:38.370
about the public prosecutor who helped
to conceal his father's corruption.

32:39.216 --> 32:41.645
Father will also know
about the 200 billion won.

32:42.062 --> 32:44.364
And knowing that,
he's not one to sit back and do nothing.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.105
He'll make a move.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.008
Yoon Sung.

32:48.128 --> 32:50.877
Will you continue like this with the boss?

32:50.997 --> 32:56.025
Um, Yoon Sung, what is your father like?

32:56.924 --> 32:59.153
Why doesn't he live with Ajumeoni?

33:00.821 --> 33:03.467
Does he know you're the City Hunter?

33:04.954 --> 33:06.911
Yeah. He knows.

33:07.031 --> 33:09.889
But, these days,
their opinions don't quite match,

33:10.009 --> 33:11.511
so it's been a little hard.

33:11.531 --> 33:17.250
Then, could it be that the person who got
rid of Lee Kyung Wan at the hospital was...

33:17.721 --> 33:19.280
your father?

33:24.083 --> 33:26.712
Yoon Sung, the money hasn't moved yet,
has it?

33:27.836 --> 33:30.275
It will likely move by tomorrow.

33:30.395 --> 33:32.722
We have to plant a bug
on Kim Jong Shik before then.

33:32.842 --> 33:35.356
It won't be easy to plant a bug.

33:37.332 --> 33:41.234
Administration, take your half-price
tuition promise and keep it! [Obtain it!]

33:41.354 --> 33:43.237
Keep your promise, keep your promise!

33:43.257 --> 33:47.542
National Assembly,
preserve the students' rights to study!

33:47.662 --> 33:49.394
Preserve our rights, preserve our rights!

33:49.514 --> 33:53.237
Administration, take your
half-price tuition promise and keep it!

33:53.357 --> 33:55.539
Keep your promise, keep your promise!

34:00.489 --> 34:02.628
My heart aches.

34:03.444 --> 34:05.837
You are at an age
when you should be studying.

34:06.272 --> 34:10.847
But, because of expensive tuition costs,
you all are going through such a hard time.

34:11.192 --> 34:17.010
Because it doesn't look like the
administration will find a quick resolution,

34:17.130 --> 34:19.598
I am working day and night on it.

34:20.014 --> 34:25.453
Today too, I met with administrators
from Shinsong Group and Hapdong Chemical.

34:26.793 --> 34:31.128
I received a promise that they will
establish scholarships at our university.

34:31.248 --> 34:37.245
I believe the establishment of scholarships
is the only way to lower tuition.

34:37.465 --> 34:42.134
To allow you students
to be able to study without hardship,

34:42.254 --> 34:45.415
I will ceaselessly work and do my best.

34:45.813 --> 34:47.627
So, please

34:47.899 --> 34:49.621
end the protest.

34:49.741 --> 34:50.962
We can't do that.

34:50.982 --> 34:53.251
We appreciate your hard work,

34:53.523 --> 34:55.697
but the administration's denial
of the situation

34:55.918 --> 34:57.774
makes us angry.

34:57.894 --> 35:03.825
We intend to make the administration
fulfill its ground-breaking promise.

35:04.245 --> 35:06.590
If that is the students' will,

35:06.710 --> 35:09.509
I suppose there's nothing I can do.

35:10.270 --> 35:14.078
I wish you all strength,

35:15.746 --> 35:17.849
and please don't be sick.

35:25.443 --> 35:26.730
Good luck.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.168
Our university
is deemed the best in Korea,

35:34.288 --> 35:37.775
and they say that measly tuition
is too expensive.

35:39.714 --> 35:41.364
Even if you guys drop out,

35:41.384 --> 35:44.506
there is a line of kids with money
ready to take your place.

35:45.050 --> 35:49.854
Society is led
by those with wealth and reputation anyway.

35:51.195 --> 35:52.899
Is the chairman neurotic?

35:53.019 --> 35:56.438
Why does he make us search
for bugs and hidden cameras every day?

35:56.558 --> 35:58.650
He must have done something severely wrong.

35:58.770 --> 36:01.999
Anyhow, we get paid by the visit,
so it's no loss for us.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.546
So he's going to prepare extra carefully.

36:10.887 --> 36:12.772
Just a second...
Assistant Kim.

36:12.892 --> 36:13.692
Yes.

36:13.708 --> 36:16.380
Who hooked up this corded phone again?

36:16.500 --> 36:20.984
I've told her, but I think the cleaning lady
forgets and keeps hooking it back up.

36:21.618 --> 36:23.524
Moronic woman...
Fire her immediately!

36:23.644 --> 36:25.518
Doesn't she know where she's working?

36:25.638 --> 36:28.545
Corded phones and internet connections
are absolutely not allowed in my office.

36:28.665 --> 36:30.611
It's too easy to plant bugs in the cables.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.098
Yes, Chairman.

36:32.218 --> 36:34.861
Don't do a careless job
just because you do it every day.

36:34.981 --> 36:37.544
Be thorough, thorough.
All right?

36:42.257 --> 36:43.309
Assistant Kim.

36:43.429 --> 36:45.251
What time is my dentist appointment?

36:48.750 --> 36:50.889
This came from the UCT dental technician.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.360
2 crowns and a crowning kit, right?

36:53.480 --> 36:55.282
Please check it.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.635
Yes, this is right.

36:58.755 --> 36:59.959
Have a good day.

37:04.416 --> 37:05.758
Please go ahead.

37:20.765 --> 37:23.095
Please open wide and say "ah."

37:30.702 --> 37:32.714
There, it's all done.

37:37.670 --> 37:39.918
It's a good thing we put on the crown.

37:40.038 --> 37:42.293
I suffered for nothing all that time.

37:42.413 --> 37:44.595
It will be comfortable now.

37:45.954 --> 37:47.722
You did a good job, Dr. Seo.

37:51.148 --> 37:52.417
Chairman.

37:52.537 --> 37:56.731
This afternoon, an anonymous donor wants
to drop by and contribute to a scholarship.

37:56.851 --> 37:59.273
She wants to meet with you personally.

38:00.469 --> 38:02.142
She wants to meet with me personally?

38:02.143 --> 38:08.401
Jung gu eop jineon suri suri
maha suri su suri

38:08.521 --> 38:12.518
sabaha suri suri
maha suri su suri...

38:12.638 --> 38:14.131
Seunim*.
(*used to address a monk)

38:15.455 --> 38:18.481
I'm going out for a bit.

38:18.771 --> 38:20.584
Are you going far?

38:20.704 --> 38:22.795
I have something to take care of in Seoul.

38:22.915 --> 38:26.113
You're not well, so come back quickly.

38:26.899 --> 38:27.915
Yes.

38:32.718 --> 38:34.676
What?
Lee Kyung Hee has disappeared?

38:34.796 --> 38:38.725
Yes. The day you visited,
she disappeared without a trace,

38:38.845 --> 38:40.628
and the hospital found themselves
in a difficult position.

38:40.748 --> 38:43.833
There was no family to contact,
so they apparently couldn't find her.

38:44.105 --> 38:47.545
You said her husband, Park Moo Yul,
was a presidential security agent, right?

38:53.237 --> 38:57.920
There's no record of an
Agent Park Moo Yul who served in 1983.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.034
Are you certain?

38:59.054 --> 39:02.397
I looked through all the personnel files,
but I can't find anything.

39:02.517 --> 39:05.332
Are there situations
when the personnel files get deleted?

39:05.452 --> 39:08.414
I'm not sure.
I don't really know.

39:08.976 --> 39:11.949
She definitely said he was at Aung San too.

39:20.539 --> 39:21.539
[Address Book]

39:21.540 --> 39:23.140
[Chatting]

39:23.341 --> 39:26.803
<i>Please get me some fresh clothes
from Sae Hee unni's hospital.</i>

39:31.498 --> 39:33.661
By any chance, do you know of a Kim Na Na?

39:33.681 --> 39:38.148
She's pretty like you, and has long hair.

39:38.268 --> 39:40.540
Does she come here?

39:42.551 --> 39:46.181
No.
I don't think I know her.

39:52.452 --> 39:54.283
What style are you looking for?

39:54.403 --> 39:57.111
Something comfortable to wear at home.

39:58.289 --> 39:59.739
Give me this one.

40:00.088 --> 40:01.991
I don't think this is reallly something
to wear at home.

40:02.111 --> 40:03.496
But it's pretty.

40:03.616 --> 40:05.744
And give me this one too.

40:11.772 --> 40:12.665
And this one too.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.079
And this...

40:21.038 --> 40:23.159
What are all these clothes?

40:23.558 --> 40:25.207
How can I wear these around the house?

40:25.327 --> 40:27.455
Oh, I don't know.
Just wear them.

40:27.975 --> 40:30.002
I told you,
my clothes are at Sae Hee unni's.

40:30.122 --> 40:31.579
Otherwise, at my house...

40:31.699 --> 40:34.034
They came to the animal hospital too,

40:34.154 --> 40:35.828
looking for you.

40:35.948 --> 40:37.841
So, just wear those.

40:38.276 --> 40:41.259
Hey, I just bought clothes
that would cover the fact

40:41.260 --> 40:44.927
that you're short and have no figure,
so you'll like them too.

40:45.979 --> 40:48.915
Doing this, you seem just like my Daddy
Long Legs* Ahjussi. (*secret benefactor)

40:49.035 --> 40:52.803
Ah, right. Did you know Prosecutor Kim Young
Joo is my Daddy Long Legs ahjussi?

40:52.823 --> 40:54.416
I just found out a few days ago.

40:54.536 --> 40:56.519
I was totally shocked!

40:56.990 --> 41:01.304
Then, don't you think Prosecutor
Kim Young Joo would help us if we asked?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.864
If he knows that
I was even kidnapped by Kim Jong Shik...

41:03.984 --> 41:07.942
Hey, don't you know
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo is after me?

41:08.667 --> 41:11.151
You're not Kim Na Na,
you're Bear* Na Na. (*dumb)

41:11.271 --> 41:13.453
How can you help when you're so clueless?

41:13.573 --> 41:14.831
Look here, Lee Yoon Sung.

41:14.951 --> 41:16.788
A person can make a mistake.

41:16.908 --> 41:17.858
Yoon Sung.

41:17.978 --> 41:19.018
Yoon Sung.

41:19.689 --> 41:21.393
Have you ever used this?
It looks like soap, right?

41:21.513 --> 41:23.042
It's shampoo.

41:23.162 --> 41:24.474
Do you want to try it Na Na?

41:24.594 --> 41:27.308
I want to, but I can't wash my hair
because of my hurt shoulder.

41:27.428 --> 41:28.595
Really?

41:28.715 --> 41:30.399
Shall I wash it for you?
Let's go. I'll wash it.

41:30.419 --> 41:31.723
Ahjussi, why would you wash her hair?!

41:31.743 --> 41:34.015
- Then, why don't you do it?!
- I will!

41:34.135 --> 41:36.034
Then go ahead.
Why yell? You totally startled me!

41:36.154 --> 41:37.357
Give it to me.

41:37.477 --> 41:39.152
You wash your own hair.

41:50.682 --> 41:51.805
Geez.

41:52.902 --> 41:55.240
The things I end up doing...

41:55.360 --> 41:56.662
Make sure you get this part too.

41:56.666 --> 41:59.287
All right. Okay.

41:59.407 --> 42:00.737
Here too.

42:02.894 --> 42:04.706
Ah, that feels nice.

42:05.069 --> 42:06.592
It's cold!

42:14.966 --> 42:16.579
What are you doing?

42:19.242 --> 42:20.982
What are you doing?

42:21.102 --> 42:23.592
What do you mean?
I'm washing your hair.

42:30.373 --> 42:32.422
Ah! Hey, Bear Na Na!
You...

42:34.180 --> 42:35.920
Hey, come here.

42:36.446 --> 42:37.968
It's cold!

42:38.088 --> 42:40.006
Hey, I'm injured.

42:43.088 --> 42:45.027
Look at this, aigoo!

43:19.060 --> 43:21.601
You said you were going to plant a bug
on Kim Jong Shik. Have you?

43:22.018 --> 43:24.283
Yeah.
I planted one on his body.

43:24.403 --> 43:26.078
On his body?

43:32.829 --> 43:34.190
I want to listen too.

43:38.113 --> 43:38.874
Yes?

43:45.474 --> 43:46.797
Aigoo.

43:47.939 --> 43:50.314
She's the one who wants
to anonymously contribute scholarship money.

43:50.434 --> 43:52.126
Welcome, Madam.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.221
Please prepare some tea.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.998
- Yes.
- Ah, no, thank you.

43:57.118 --> 43:59.662
I just wanted to drop it off.
I have to go.

44:03.874 --> 44:07.626
The pass code is written on the piece of paper.

44:08.369 --> 44:10.055
It's a billion won.

44:12.484 --> 44:16.287
I've sold kimbap (seaweed rolled rice) and
ddeokbokki (spicy rice noodles) all my life.

44:17.302 --> 44:21.254
I've also received this support
from a philanthropist in the US.

44:22.994 --> 44:27.053
Please help the students with hardships

44:27.173 --> 44:29.791
so they can study without
worrying about the tuition.

44:29.911 --> 44:35.203
It must not be easy to hand over
money you've saved all your life.

44:35.692 --> 44:40.216
I don't have much longer to live, so
I wanted to do something good before I go.

44:40.913 --> 44:42.725
Are you ill?

44:45.359 --> 44:48.060
Can you just let us know
who you are and where you live?

44:48.180 --> 44:50.779
My name is Lee Kyung Hee,

44:51.060 --> 44:54.852
<i>but I prefer if you don't reveal my name.</i>

44:57.223 --> 44:58.728
Lee Yoon Sung.

45:02.690 --> 45:06.605
Just quietly help students with hardships
so they can study.

45:06.968 --> 45:08.509
Please.

45:08.871 --> 45:10.231
Then, I'll be going.

45:10.351 --> 45:11.536
Yes.

45:12.136 --> 45:13.442
Please see her out.

45:13.562 --> 45:15.200
Ah, yes.

45:51.686 --> 45:53.336
I've seen her out.

45:53.456 --> 45:56.748
Since it's an anonymous contribution,
it doesn't have to be reported, right?

45:56.868 --> 45:58.542
Haven't you worked with me
long enough to know?

45:58.662 --> 46:00.591
Here, some spending money.

46:00.953 --> 46:03.545
Oh.
Thank you, Chairman.

47:19.873 --> 47:21.341
Did you find her?

47:22.810 --> 47:23.770
No.

47:24.514 --> 47:26.362
I must have been too late.

47:27.813 --> 47:30.954
You'll find her soon.
Don't worry, Yoon Sung.

47:34.180 --> 47:37.661
We have to take
Kim Jong Shik's 200 billion won.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.203
I'm going upstairs.

47:46.898 --> 47:48.620
His shoulders are stooped so low.

47:48.740 --> 47:50.637
He may not say anything,

47:50.757 --> 47:53.229
but he probably really misses his mother.

47:53.646 --> 47:57.014
Even when Muangsuri, the woman who
breastfed him, died, he went a little nuts.

47:57.034 --> 48:00.086
Can't you tell me what the situation is?

48:00.206 --> 48:02.116
You have to hear it
from Yoon Sung himself.

48:02.236 --> 48:03.856
I can't say anything.

48:12.927 --> 48:14.704
What about this sofa?

48:14.824 --> 48:16.806
Yes, it's nice.

48:17.241 --> 48:19.398
That there, what do you think of that?

48:25.525 --> 48:26.889
Can I take some pictures?

48:27.009 --> 48:28.901
Yes, please do.

48:29.209 --> 48:33.487
I'll come often to your shop.
Please take good care of us.

48:33.607 --> 48:34.660
Thank you.

48:34.780 --> 48:38.050
Now then...
This bag is nice.

48:38.170 --> 48:39.951
- Give me one of these.
- Yes.

48:39.952 --> 48:41.052
Good.

48:41.088 --> 48:42.499
That handbag is nice.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.014
- Ah, it's pretty.
- Ah...

48:44.015 --> 48:47.378
It is pretty.
Give me that and this together.

48:49.884 --> 48:51.534
It looks comfortable.

48:53.147 --> 48:55.431
What do you think?
Does it look all right?

48:55.551 --> 48:56.725
It's very nice.

48:56.845 --> 48:58.610
Thank you.

49:03.070 --> 49:05.970
Reserve a Hajin container for tomorrow
and send it to my house.

49:06.090 --> 49:08.008
Yes, I understand.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.579
Container?

49:21.342 --> 49:24.387
<i>[Myung Mun University Accounting Records]</i>

49:26.531 --> 49:29.731
The Myung Mun Foundation's accounts

49:30.737 --> 49:34.072
don't match up with the breakdown
of their publicly announced reserves.

49:35.304 --> 49:37.552
There's 200 billion won missing.

49:41.917 --> 49:43.548
It couldn't be...

49:44.328 --> 49:45.814
a slush fund?

49:58.042 --> 50:01.758
There's no way I'm going down
while I'm alive.

50:56.703 --> 50:57.773
Father.

51:07.281 --> 51:09.366
What's going on?

51:09.819 --> 51:12.121
What is all this money?

51:13.930 --> 51:16.976
You told me you are not involved
in any corruption or crime.

51:17.773 --> 51:20.945
Why is there 200 billion won
missing from the foundation's reserves?

51:25.475 --> 51:28.593
You look tired so drink this as you work.

51:29.826 --> 51:31.385
Are you listening in on Kim Jong Shik?

51:31.505 --> 51:33.741
- Let me listen...
- Don't, really!

51:33.861 --> 51:35.390
I can just listen on my own.

51:35.510 --> 51:36.706
Rest a little.
I'll listen.

51:36.826 --> 51:38.791
I said don't.

51:41.782 --> 51:43.286
Go and rest...

51:43.406 --> 51:44.670
or sleep.

51:44.690 --> 51:46.710
But I'm not sleepy.

51:54.856 --> 51:56.506
Have you looked into all of it?

51:56.626 --> 51:58.332
Because you're my father...

51:59.728 --> 52:02.266
When the City Hunter
has already sent a notice,

52:02.386 --> 52:04.627
how can I sit and do nothing?

52:04.747 --> 52:08.325
I don't want you to end up
like Lee Kyung Wan and Seo Yong Hak.

52:08.651 --> 52:10.446
It's not too late even now.

52:10.566 --> 52:15.683
Return this money to the school,
or turn yourself in.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.471
I don't want to.

52:19.743 --> 52:20.468
Father.

52:20.588 --> 52:22.680
All the other schools are the same.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.683
Why should I be the only one?

52:25.803 --> 52:28.438
Why do you want me
to be the only one to do that?

52:29.707 --> 52:31.447
Because it's the law...

52:32.734 --> 52:34.873
Because we have to follow the law...

52:36.016 --> 52:39.225
Because innocent people
are being hurt by your greed...

52:41.473 --> 52:44.106
Please return to being the father I respect.

52:44.226 --> 52:45.647
Please.

52:48.873 --> 52:53.435
I've come too far... to go back.

52:53.555 --> 52:58.475
And what if,
I take legal action against you, Father?

52:58.595 --> 53:03.331
Since you're a prosecutor,
you need to do your job.

53:33.570 --> 53:36.035
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo,

53:36.615 --> 53:39.509
I see your anguish has begun.

53:40.542 --> 53:42.699
I'll be watching you.

53:47.521 --> 53:49.677
Tomorrow is D-day.

54:02.349 --> 54:05.848
My tracking device has stopped here.

54:07.769 --> 54:10.909
That means the money is in the container.

54:11.029 --> 54:14.082
So, that's full of money, huh?

54:14.202 --> 54:16.855
But, what are you going to do
with the money you take from there?

54:16.975 --> 54:19.459
It's money soaked with the tears of blood
of students and their parents.

54:19.579 --> 54:21.452
We have to return it.

54:21.472 --> 54:23.664
Whoa, you're pretty impressive, Yoon Sung.

54:23.784 --> 54:25.966
If I take that money,

54:26.086 --> 54:27.716
Father will probably come after me.

54:27.836 --> 54:30.471
No matter how we do it,
we need to protect it.

54:53.904 --> 54:56.304
What the...?
Ah!

55:12.605 --> 55:16.694
Hey! What the he**?
You bastard...

55:19.395 --> 55:20.695
Hey...

55:37.698 --> 55:39.202
Whoa!

55:40.326 --> 55:41.831
Is this all money?

56:12.720 --> 56:15.566
Ahjussi.
Father is following me.

56:15.686 --> 56:17.542
Let's go by the plan.

57:13.106 --> 57:14.773
Go left.

58:39.381 --> 58:41.411
I'm going to have to take that money.

58:41.531 --> 58:42.861
What are you going to do with it?

58:42.881 --> 58:44.602
I'm going to send it
to Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

58:44.722 --> 58:48.263
I was going to return the money
to the original owners,

58:48.383 --> 58:50.873
and take revenge on Kim Jong Shik.

58:51.163 --> 58:54.009
Are you sharing your erroneous ideas
with me when it's already over?

58:54.353 --> 58:56.112
I warned you, didn't I?

59:04.452 --> 59:06.011
Why can't you hit me?

59:06.131 --> 59:10.789
Why don't you attack?
Take me down and do as you planned!

59:17.452 --> 59:23.491
In war, no matter who your opponent is,
you must win no matter what.

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:33.732
Yoon Sung, that punk...

01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:37.013
He dares to con me?

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.905
- It was taken?!
- Yes.

01:00:48.025 --> 01:00:49.881
They must have been after some books.

01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:51.150
They were desperate.

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:53.869
Books?!
You...!

01:00:55.533 --> 01:00:58.814
Hey, do you think those were books?!

01:00:59.992 --> 01:01:00.917
Chairman!

01:01:01.037 --> 01:01:02.113
Chairman!

01:01:02.965 --> 01:01:04.234
Chairman!

01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:29.929
Wow...
This is all money?

01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:31.089
All money?

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:32.703
Money?

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:36.165
Oh, smell...
It smells like money.

01:01:36.285 --> 01:01:38.304
In any case, the boss must be furious.

01:01:38.424 --> 01:01:40.517
Oh, Yoon Sung, you have a pretty good brain.

01:01:40.552 --> 01:01:42.705
Preparing an identical truck...

01:01:42.825 --> 01:01:44.699
Hey, if we sit on it,
it's a money cushion, right?

01:01:44.719 --> 01:01:47.843
- A money cushion!
- Ahjussi, what are you doing?

01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:49.819
Oh, this is nice!

01:01:50.714 --> 01:01:51.947
- Get up, c'mon.
- Whoa!

01:01:51.967 --> 01:01:55.300
Yoon Sung, there's something
I've always wanted to do. May I?

01:01:56.259 --> 01:01:58.507
I want to toss this just once, really.

01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:01.099
Just one stack...
Let me throw up and scatter one stack!

01:02:01.219 --> 01:02:02.567
It's money!

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.851
It's money!

01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:08.317
It's money!

01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:30.819
What is this?

01:02:30.939 --> 01:02:32.033
City Hunter?

01:02:37.095 --> 01:02:38.295
Half-priced...

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.012
<i>The chairman was misappropriating money</i>

01:02:40.013 --> 01:02:42.208
<i>from the Myung Mun University reserves
for personal use,</i>

01:02:42.209 --> 01:02:45.171
<i>and it is now being returned
to fulfill the half-price tuition objective.</i>

01:02:45.291 --> 01:02:46.983
<i>City Hunter.</i>

01:02:47.525 --> 01:02:48.957
Did you receive money
from the City Hunter?

01:02:49.077 --> 01:02:50.726
Yeah, I got it.

01:02:50.741 --> 01:02:52.858
I never thought
the tuition money would come.

01:02:52.859 --> 01:02:53.907
That's so great.

01:02:53.908 --> 01:02:55.693
- Then, it really is half-priced tuition.
- That's right.

01:02:55.694 --> 01:02:58.467
Mom, did a package come to our house?

01:02:58.793 --> 01:02:59.790
Really?

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:01.821
And you never left the house?

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.612
Everybody else got one,
why didn't I get one?

01:03:04.732 --> 01:03:07.462
Hey, how happy and great is this?

01:03:07.582 --> 01:03:09.788
What are you guys doing?

01:03:09.908 --> 01:03:12.179
Let's have a party, a party.
Party party party party...

01:03:12.199 --> 01:03:14.955
Go to the market
and buy stuff you want to eat.

01:03:15.075 --> 01:03:19.541
Beef, pork, chicken, bring the whole market!
I'll cook everything.

01:03:19.904 --> 01:03:22.472
Then buy buy buy me some
fried chicken chicken chicken!

01:03:22.473 --> 01:03:24.254
Aigoo, you chicken monster...

01:03:24.374 --> 01:03:25.575
C'mon, let's go.

01:03:33.793 --> 01:03:36.315
Let's get some of these.

01:03:36.994 --> 01:03:38.509
What, you're going to put those in?

01:03:38.629 --> 01:03:40.757
Japchae* has to have vegetables
to taste good. (*clear noodle dish)

01:03:40.877 --> 01:03:43.294
Hey!
I hate vegetables!

01:03:43.414 --> 01:03:44.691
Especially carrots, I hate those the most!

01:03:44.811 --> 01:03:47.084
Don't just eat meat.
Eat some vegetables too.

01:03:47.204 --> 01:03:50.728
That way you get
all vitamins A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

01:03:50.848 --> 01:03:52.468
Hey, do you know what vitamin G is?

01:03:52.588 --> 01:03:54.861
What is vitamin G good for?

01:03:54.981 --> 01:03:57.554
Ah, tomatoes...
Tomatoes are really good for you too.

01:03:57.669 --> 01:03:59.918
Please have a taste of the tomatoes.

01:04:02.302 --> 01:04:04.509
Have your husband taste it too.

01:04:04.599 --> 01:04:05.579
Husband?

01:04:05.905 --> 01:04:07.373
But we're not...

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.980
These will make good japchae.

01:04:14.161 --> 01:04:15.248
Have you tasted that brand before?

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:17.243
But, it would be so much better
without these vegetables.

01:04:18.258 --> 01:04:19.817
Oh!
The tomatoes...!
