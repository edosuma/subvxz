WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.537
Previously on Scorpion...
My entire school career,

00:03.571 --> 00:04.772
I have only missed
three days.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.175
Here it comes.
And I've never had a tardy.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.143
I actually just engineered
this water filter.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.712
If I can get one of these
to every West Altadenian,

00:11.745 --> 00:14.115
they would choose to use
tap water over bottled

00:14.148 --> 00:15.749
simply because of the taste.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.386
Walter doesn't feel
anything romantic towards me,

00:18.419 --> 00:20.321
and-and I could never
be attracted to him.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.123
What's wrong with Walter?
He's an amazing man.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.757
Why-why would you never
be attracted to him?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.559
He and I are alike.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.760
Too much head,
too little heart.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.795
'Cause that's what I need.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.829
A smart man, sure,

00:28.862 --> 00:32.533
but one who is sweet
and caring and vulnerable.

00:34.668 --> 00:35.803
PAIGE:
Quinoa, chia-seed

00:35.836 --> 00:38.572
Belgian waffle
with a side of organic,

00:38.606 --> 00:40.441
homemade vegan apple-butter.

00:40.474 --> 00:44.178
So good. Syrup's optional.
And I hope you're hungry.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.746
Thank you, Chef Dineen.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.947
(chuckles)
I'm famished.

00:46.980 --> 00:50.050
I just wanted to try a new,
healthy breakfast, so be honest.

00:57.325 --> 01:00.494
You know, I-I know that
the syrup is optional,

01:00.528 --> 01:03.097
but I would like to
exercise the option.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.799
Okay, no problem.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.801
(spits)

01:14.775 --> 01:16.544
You're gonna dilute the flavor
of the apple-butter.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.378
That's the intention.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.747
Now, Paige, I appreciate
the effort,

01:19.780 --> 01:22.516
but the waffles are dry
and the butter is sour,

01:22.550 --> 01:25.119
and the meal is missing,
well, flavor.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.354
I said be honest, not brutal.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.889
Oh, it-it wasn't my
intention to insult you.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.524
I-I love you.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.160
That's why I can't lie to you.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.361
If I did, I would be

01:33.394 --> 01:35.563
denying you the
opportunity to improve.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.898
Well, I thank you
for that,

01:37.931 --> 01:41.169
but sometimes it's okay
to tell a white lie

01:41.202 --> 01:43.237
in order to protect
someone's feelings.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.273
So, by your logic,
I should continue

01:45.306 --> 01:46.707
to eat the waffles,
even though they're

01:46.740 --> 01:49.143
unsatisfying and they
lack nutritional value,

01:49.177 --> 01:50.911
potentially affecting
my cognitive function

01:50.944 --> 01:51.779
and productivity?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.781
(laughs):
It seems very inefficient.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.652
Or, if you think a more
judicious modulation

01:58.686 --> 02:01.189
of the truth is
worth practicing,

02:01.222 --> 02:03.157
then I can give it a try.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.892
I'd appreciate it.
Oh!

02:04.925 --> 02:07.795
Don't forget,
the UCLA event tonight.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.730
"Trigger Loop as
a Major Determinant

02:09.763 --> 02:11.199
"of Transcriptional Fidelity,

02:11.232 --> 02:12.833
and Its Role in
DNA Expression".

02:12.866 --> 02:14.368
It's thrilling, right?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.136
Looking forward to it.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.772
And that's how it's done.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.379
Of the three,
this cup

02:25.413 --> 02:26.747
tastes the best--
what brand is it?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.949
It is actually filtered
tap water

02:28.982 --> 02:30.751
from right here
in West Altadenia.

02:30.784 --> 02:35.389
So far, 99.038%
of pedestrians surveyed

02:35.423 --> 02:38.426
haven chosen our tap
over the leading bottled brand.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.762
This water purifier attaches
easily to your kitchen sink

02:41.795 --> 02:42.630
in just three minutes.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.199
You'll never have to buy
bottled again.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.334
Okay, thanks.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.236
And be sure to tell your friends
about your new filter.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.239
All right, sure.
And also, call your local DWP

02:51.272 --> 02:52.773
and let them know
how much you love

02:52.806 --> 02:54.608
your new fresh-tasting water.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.244
Great. Uh, this is a great idea.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.845
Thanks. Uh, I have to...

02:57.878 --> 02:59.780
And the science behind it
is really fascinating.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.914
I'm sure it is.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.316
I have to get my dog to a vet.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.751
I don't see a dog.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.986
You see, the filter adjusts

03:06.019 --> 03:08.422
the compound in
a multistep process.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.891
Ralphy-boy, I envy you.

03:10.924 --> 03:14.395
Look at you, at your age,
spending your spring break

03:14.428 --> 03:15.429
saving the planet.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.365
No one parties like I do.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.899
When's Patty get here?
Soon.

03:18.932 --> 03:19.933
Thank you for your support.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.436
Oh, excuse me, ma'am,

03:22.470 --> 03:23.704
do you have a moment
to learn about

03:23.737 --> 03:25.606
water purification
systems?
Sure.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.241
Look at her,

03:27.275 --> 03:30.311
engaging the constituency
with science.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.814
She's clearly enjoyed working
with you on this project.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.249
How about you
seize the moment?

03:35.283 --> 03:36.350
Ask her out already.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.356
You know what, Ralph?
You're right. I will go.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.828
(speaking softly)

03:47.861 --> 03:51.532
Hey, I'm ready for my shift.
Where do you want me?

03:51.565 --> 03:52.933
Where do I want you?

03:52.966 --> 03:54.468
That's not normally
how this works.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.903
You boss me around,
remember?

03:55.936 --> 03:58.672
Hey, something wrong?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.341
Nothing important.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.410
No, hey, Patty,

04:02.443 --> 04:04.445
if something's bothering you,
it is important to me.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.381
I had my first tardy
this morning.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.383
I don't want to talk about it.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.321
Here's all the stuff.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.925
Sylvester,
I actually have to go.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.894
I have a potential investor
meeting for my binding agent.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.996
Okay, yeah, um,
well, thank you.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.031
For all this.
(chuckles)

04:24.064 --> 04:26.334
Um... I, uh...

04:26.367 --> 04:29.770
I...

04:29.803 --> 04:31.739
Do you have something
you want to tell me?

04:31.772 --> 04:34.342
Yes. Yes.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.643
Uh...

04:37.611 --> 04:39.613
You know what?
I can't remember.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.081
Okay.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.784
Well, when you do,
you know where to find me.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.553
Bye.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.957
(Ralph sighs)

04:49.990 --> 04:51.959
You missed your shot again.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.895
There's something more pressing.
Like what?

04:54.928 --> 04:56.464
Patty Logan got a tardy.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.631
Yeah.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.469
Something serious
must have happened.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.737
We are gonna get
to the bottom of it.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.073
What is this?

05:06.106 --> 05:09.042
Who replaced the coffee
grinds with tree bark?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.478
That's not tree bark,
that's chicory.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.045
What possessed you to do that?

05:12.079 --> 05:14.014
Voodoo spirit.
Got to get everybody in the mood

05:14.047 --> 05:15.383
for our trip to the bayou.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.085
At least I'll be
wide awake for it.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.087
Any other preparations
I should know about?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.390
He mapped out all his
favorite New Orleans sites,

05:22.423 --> 05:24.057
mostly food-related.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.493
Babe, this could be
my last hurrah

05:25.526 --> 05:27.027
before this potential
bambino comes,

05:27.060 --> 05:28.562
so I got to make it count.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.464
Last time I was in NOLA

05:30.498 --> 05:33.033
was 2012 to bet on
March Madness,

05:33.066 --> 05:34.868
and I made a killing,
so I stayed for Mardi Gras,

05:34.902 --> 05:36.704
and from what I remember,
I had the time of my life.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.573
You do remember we're
going there to work, right?

05:39.607 --> 05:41.842
Every party has a pooper.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.143
That's why you're here.
(blows raspberry)

05:43.176 --> 05:44.445
What part of shrinking

05:44.478 --> 05:45.813
an overgrowing, virus-carrying

05:45.846 --> 05:46.947
mosquito population is a party?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.650
A potentially fatal,
Zika-like virus.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.419
This is not to be taken lightly.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.986
If I was taking it lightly,
mon cher,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.555
I wouldn't be
sequestering my bride

05:54.588 --> 05:57.391
and the potential bun
in her oven in the garage

05:57.425 --> 06:00.060
to stay away from
all those scary skeeters.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.129
Okay, you know you're probably
just talking

06:02.162 --> 06:03.564
to my breakfast burrito.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.998
And you didn't
sequester anyone.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
I am voluntarily staying back.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.102
Don't worry, I'm gonna
bring you back lots of beads.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.572
(phone rings)
Uh, that must be Dr. Ditterman
at State College

06:11.605 --> 06:12.673
of New Orleans Entomology.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.541
He said he had
an update for us

06:13.574 --> 06:16.043
before we fly down.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.946
I'm so glad I was able
to catch you before you left.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.448
Dr. Ditterman, are you okay?
You look a little pale.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.883
We've just had an update
from the CDC.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.686
Uh, they're not divulging
this information to the public,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.489
but the infection rate
from the mosquito virus

06:28.522 --> 06:31.191
is significantly higher
than previously reported.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.192
How much higher?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.160
The CDC is now aware

06:33.193 --> 06:35.996
of over 1,300 cases
across the Southeast.

06:36.029 --> 06:39.600
1,300? Why were they
keeping that under wraps?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.001
Symptoms often present
as the flu or pneumonia,

06:41.034 --> 06:42.603
so it's been easy
to miscalculate.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.205
And there have been
60 fatalities already.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.941
Well, that's almost
a five percent mortality rate.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.143
So I assume the CDC is
keeping this secret

06:50.177 --> 06:51.979
to prevent a mass exodus
in the region.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.081
And the abandoned properties
would just become

06:54.114 --> 06:55.883
breeding grounds
for more mosquitoes.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.051
And those who stayed behind
would be overrun by the virus.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.521
That's the CDC's
assessment, too.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.156
With rainy season days away,
the mosquito population

07:03.190 --> 07:05.058
could expand tenfold.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.496
This disease is on the verge
of becoming an epidemic.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.163
Does our existing plan
still work?

07:10.197 --> 07:11.965
These sterile male mosquitoes

07:11.999 --> 07:12.933
that we have
genetically engineered,

07:12.966 --> 07:15.969
and your team have replicated,
can still be

07:16.003 --> 07:18.005
released into the
local ecosystem.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.139
They will mate
with the females,

07:19.172 --> 07:20.974
who will produce no offspring,

07:21.008 --> 07:22.476
killing off a generation
of mosquitoes

07:22.510 --> 07:23.711
and the virus that they carry.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.745
We followed your instructions
to the letter.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.114
Sterile mosquitoes are ready
for distribution.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.083
Given the new developments,
I was hoping that we could just

07:30.117 --> 07:31.652
disperse the mosquitoes
ourselves.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.087
The release site needs to be
precisely calculated

07:34.121 --> 07:36.023
and it can change according to
barometric pressure

07:36.056 --> 07:37.658
and wind conditions,

07:37.691 --> 07:39.560
which we have to
calculate on-site.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.094
We're on a flight in an hour.
We'll see you soon.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.262
Okay, I'll see you soon.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.196
Okay, team, you're up.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.966
Son of a gun,
we're gonna have some fun.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.101
(zydeco music playing)

07:48.135 --> 07:51.071
Oh, God, even better
when it's fresh.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.606
You could help us
with the bug spray

07:52.640 --> 07:53.741
so we don't get
infected.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.708
What about my beignet?

07:54.742 --> 07:56.977
All right, we've got
some chicken carcasses,

07:57.010 --> 07:58.746
a tranquilizer gun.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.914
This boat's got
some odd equipment.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.683
Yeah, swamp's a
dangerous place.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.985
Got snakes, alligators,
your boars.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.820
And that's just
the animals.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.656
This landscape can
be quite unruly.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.023
Got to stay on your tippy-toes.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.859
Wait, that reminds me.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.794
Tipitina's is a really
cool bar by the river

08:13.827 --> 08:14.928
we should check out
when we're done.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.998
Kill the music,
or I'm gonna kill you.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.099
You are such a grouch.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.068
Just trying to let loose
in the Crescent City, Cabe.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.102
(music stops)

08:24.872 --> 08:26.139
Hi.
DITTERMAN: Hey..

08:26.173 --> 08:28.576
Nice to meet you all in person.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.010
Sorry it's under
these circumstances.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.212
Our mosquitoes?
You have

08:32.245 --> 08:34.047
just over 43 minutes
to release 'em,

08:34.081 --> 08:35.883
or they'll suffocate
in that tin,

08:35.916 --> 08:38.185
rendering them useless,
and the virus unstoppable.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.053
That can't hold
very many bugs.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.789
Are you sure that's enough
to avert a plague?

08:41.822 --> 08:42.790
Well, surprisingly,

08:42.823 --> 08:43.924
female mosquitoes are

08:43.957 --> 08:45.559
more attracted to sterile males.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.794
That's probably how
I landed Happy.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.896
Yeah, they seek them out
to mate.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.065
This tin-full could
cull the hatch by 90%.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.235
The remaining ten percent isn't
enough to spread the virus.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.369
It better, because there are
only a few days

08:56.403 --> 08:59.006
in the breeding season,
and no time to engineer more.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.040
This is all we have.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.776
Okay, no problem.
So, considering

09:02.810 --> 09:05.746
bug concentration,
wind patterns,

09:05.779 --> 09:07.815
depth of swamp water,
and humidity,

09:07.848 --> 09:10.183
this is the ideal drop zone.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.284
That's accessible by fanboat,

09:11.318 --> 09:14.121
but it's deep in the wetlands,
so no time to waste.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.923
I'll, I'll let you get to it.
PAIGE: Wait.

09:15.956 --> 09:16.757
You're not going
with us?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.626
The director of the CDC
is flying in

09:18.659 --> 09:20.360
from Atlanta, and needs
to be debriefed in person.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.062
Who's driving?

09:22.095 --> 09:23.697
I took the wheel
during a swamp tour

09:23.731 --> 09:25.165
during my last visit
to the Pelican State.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.100
I wasn't supposed to,
but I did great until

09:27.134 --> 09:29.169
that tour guide scolded me
for no good reason.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.170
I can handle it.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.338
Thank you for your help, Doctor.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.373
Welcome.
I'll get out of your hair.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.341
Oh, speaking of which,

09:34.374 --> 09:36.910
I can hardly notice
that yours is a toupee.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.112
It's quite realistic.

09:39.146 --> 09:42.082
Uh, um... thank you?

09:42.115 --> 09:45.018
Yeah.

09:45.052 --> 09:48.055
What possessed
you to say that?
You did.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.791
I'm practicing white lies,
like we talked about.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.260
The toupee was actually
very noticeable.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.263
Oh, you really need to go over
the rules of white lies again.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.066
(Toby whoops)

10:02.202 --> 10:03.771
I got it.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.839
It's coming back to me now.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.708
Take it slow, Doc.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.378
Are you guys near
the drop zone yet?
PAIGE: Not yet.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.379
Getting close.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.347
We need to head west.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.049
TOBY:
Copy that.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.055
(engine revving)
Uh-- Oh, my beads!

10:22.089 --> 10:24.692
Whoa-oh-uh...

10:24.725 --> 10:27.094
Toby, Toby, stop the boat.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.664
WALTER: We need to go back.
The mosquitoes went overboard.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.666
Damn it, Doc,
I said to take it slow.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.334
That was not my fault.
The fan sucked in the beads,

10:34.367 --> 10:35.969
it was choking me.
PAIGE:
You shouldn't have had

10:36.003 --> 10:37.270
those stupid beads on
in the first place.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.371
We do not have time for this.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.173
Just turn the boat around
so we can get the canister.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.274
It's way back that way.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.781
TOBY:
You know, for the record,

10:47.815 --> 10:48.782
my beads are not stupid.

10:48.816 --> 10:49.582
You said yourself they're cool.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.284
PAIGE:
Do none of you understand

10:51.318 --> 10:53.086
the concept of a white lie?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.221
Up there, I see the container.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.793
Okay.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.730
A little closer,
I'll scoop it up.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.332
(all scream)

11:06.767 --> 11:07.701
Gator!

11:10.437 --> 11:11.404
It got the tin.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.406
Gator? As in "alligator"?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.776
Swallowed it whole. One bite.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.277
PAIGE: We can't just let him
get the mosquitoes.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.146
That tin is the only way
to stop the virus.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.451
♪

11:31.825 --> 11:32.960
How the hell
do we stop the plague

11:32.993 --> 11:33.861
if we don't have
those mosquitoes?

11:33.894 --> 11:36.363
We can't.
We're cooked like crawdads.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.299
He's right. In 34 minutes,
those mosquitoes are dead,

11:39.332 --> 11:41.368
and the pandemic
becomes irreversible.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.036
What's the plan?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.738
You know,

11:44.772 --> 11:46.974
we could hit the big guy
with one of these tranq darts.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.842
I could perform
a quick surgery

11:48.876 --> 11:50.143
and take the tin out.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.512
I mean, small incision,
suture with fishing line.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.680
It'd be easy as étouffée.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.249
Well, how do we do that?
We need the beast to tranq him.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.751
Maybe it's a her.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.186
And that matters why?

11:59.219 --> 12:02.022
Well, it's nesting season
for reptiles,

12:02.055 --> 12:04.324
and alligators are very
territorial of their young.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.093
If we find where
she's buried her eggs,

12:06.126 --> 12:07.094
she won't be far away.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.461
Okay, the Barataria swamp

12:08.495 --> 12:10.931
is a national preserve.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.866
The rangers may keep track
of the animals

12:12.900 --> 12:14.501
and their nesting sites online.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.369
Did you guys notice any
distinguishing characteristics?

12:16.403 --> 12:20.207
Yes, she had big, sharp teeth
and a prehistoric jaw.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.509
Distinguishing
to this alligator.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.111
Oh, a long scar
over its right eye.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.445
I saw it when it jumped at me.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.115
Okay, there's a gator
in the preserve system

12:28.148 --> 12:29.950
named Yvonne.
It says here

12:29.983 --> 12:32.252
she lays her eggs
on a muddy spot

12:32.285 --> 12:34.087
half a mile southwest
of your current location.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.523
I will send the coordinates.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.891
Great! Let's get moving.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.092
CABE:
Not so fast.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.461
We start that fan,
it may scare Yvonne.

12:41.494 --> 12:45.532
This fanboat
just became a gondola.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.901
Enjoy your water.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.002
Great stuff.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.471
Saving the planet.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.506
Whatever.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.343
Patty, may I make
an observation?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.512
You really are not
acting like yourself today.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.981
I know you said
you didn't want to talk

13:01.014 --> 13:03.450
about what happened
before, but...

13:06.086 --> 13:06.987
...if you got a tardy,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.355
then it must have been
something serious.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.523
I told you, it's not important.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.325
The tardy thing
is a dumb school record

13:12.359 --> 13:14.261
that nobody cared about anyway.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.229
I cared about it.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.364
Why?

13:17.397 --> 13:18.832
'Cause you cared about it.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.269
Maybe they did me a favor.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.238
Now I don't have to worry about
being a perfect little nerd

13:25.272 --> 13:27.040
with a perfect little record.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.375
Who's "they"?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.409
What did they do?

13:29.442 --> 13:34.381
Some of the popular girls
at school found out

13:34.414 --> 13:37.484
that I asked Jesse Colt
to the Sadie Hawkins dance.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.052
They thought that

13:39.086 --> 13:40.387
it was out of line for someone

13:40.420 --> 13:44.257
with my high school
social status to ask out a jock.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.259
so they decided
to teach me a lesson,

13:46.293 --> 13:50.097
as if Jesse turning me down flat
wasn't bad enough.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.031
He said no?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.566
Idiot.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.102
And what did these girls do?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.971
I leave my bike
on the side of my garage.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.507
This morning,
the tires were slashed.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.109
They left a mean note.

14:05.445 --> 14:10.417
I was late for first period.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.454
(crying): I worked so hard
for that record.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.327
Your parents talk
to the principal?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.395
I can't tell them.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.464
Then they'd tell
the other girls' parents,

14:24.497 --> 14:28.902
and I'd be a pariah, more so.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.403
I have to get back.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.572
I told my civics teacher
I'd be back by 2:00.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.507
See you later.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.312
(sighs) I don't like people
messing with her.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.582
Don't worry.
They won't get away with it.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.594
Well, the baby gators
couldn't have gone

14:54.627 --> 14:56.563
too far from the shore, and
neither would their mother.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.498
Okay, so she's somewhere
around here, but the shoreline's

14:58.531 --> 15:01.334
miles long, and we've got 30
minutes to find the mosquitoes.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.602
How do we track her in time?

15:02.635 --> 15:03.971
WALTER: We don't
need to track her,

15:04.004 --> 15:05.305
we track the mosquitoes.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.373
If we can build
a metal detector,

15:06.406 --> 15:08.441
then we can locate the bug box
inside the gator.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.077
HAPPY:
Okay, I can help you build one.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.945
Does the boat have a radio
with an A.M. band?

15:11.979 --> 15:13.080
CABE:
Let me check.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.317
Yeah.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.285
We'll need a calculator.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.452
WALTER: Yeah, I have
a scientific calculator

15:19.486 --> 15:20.387
in my bag.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.622
I never leave home without one.
Naturally.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.992
The calculator's electronic
circuits produce

15:25.025 --> 15:27.127
a radio frequency signal.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.528
When those frequency waves

15:28.561 --> 15:31.164
reflect off of the metal
canister in the gator,

15:31.198 --> 15:32.532
they'll be audible
through A.M. radio.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.600
CABE: All right,
as soon as we locate Yvonne,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.435
I'll lure her out of the water

15:35.468 --> 15:38.138
with this delicious
chicken carcass.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.406
Then I'll hold her
with the snare

15:39.439 --> 15:40.740
until I hit her
with the tranq dart.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.309
Then it's surgery time.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.544
(vomiting in distance)

15:44.577 --> 15:46.279
We've got another one
with the stomach flu.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.447
I'm gonna need a pickup.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.182
I hate high school.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.488
I'm going to check in with
the principal's secretary,

15:55.522 --> 15:57.657
and see how much longer
we'll be waiting.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.563
What are you in for?

16:03.596 --> 16:06.066
I'm here to help a friend. You?

16:06.099 --> 16:09.536
I forgot my combination,
so I broke my lock again.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.304
H-How am I supposed
to remember, anyway?

16:11.338 --> 16:14.674
There must be hundreds
of possible combos.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.078
Uh, 64,000 combinations,
to be exact.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.412
When my pal gets back,

16:19.446 --> 16:22.215
tell him I'll be
waiting for him outside.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.516
Okay.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.386
(detector beeping steadily)

16:26.419 --> 16:27.620
(detector whirs)
Oh, we got a hit.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.423
Yeah? Let's take
it to shore, Cabe.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.125
All right, quiet.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.227
Try to disturb the water
as little as possible.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.628
Oh, there she is.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.098
CABE:
All right, Toby.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.300
Let's get that chicken ready.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.771
TOBY:
Don't tranq her
till she's lassoed.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.111
(Cajun accent):
Quiet now, cher.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.512
We huntin' cocodril.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.581
(normal voice):
That's Cajun for "alligator."

16:54.614 --> 16:59.486
Yeah? And what's Cajun
for "my foot in your ass"?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.521
I should know that;
I've heard it before.

17:02.655 --> 17:06.059
Paige, keep the boat steady
so I can make the shot.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.728
CABE:
Here you go, girl.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.664
Careful, Cabe.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.833
WALTER:
Ah, she just surfaced.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.203
She doesn't seem interested
in the chicken.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.405
That's 'cause you're not making
it seem like a tasty bird.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.739
You got to entice her, Cabe.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.741
Maybe I should've made it
a cacciatore

17:21.774 --> 17:23.410
or a chicken parmigiana?

17:23.443 --> 17:25.312
You need it to act
like it's alive.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.448
You know? No animal just pops
up and down like that.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.351
See? See how it just skims
the surface there?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.519
It's like a duck.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.587
Watch it, Toby,
you're kind of close.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.688
HAPPY
Hey, dummy, if I'm pregnant,

17:35.722 --> 17:37.424
I do not want to tell my child

17:37.457 --> 17:39.359
that Dad died as gator bait.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.595
(grumbles)

17:42.629 --> 17:43.763
CABE (quietly):
We got movement.

17:43.796 --> 17:44.764
TOBY:
And then, when she comes up

17:44.797 --> 17:47.834
for her meal, Walt,
hit her with that tranq gun.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.669
Got her in my sights.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.674
(groans)
Damn it, she's gone.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.709
Maybe she's not hungry.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.677
Whoa!

17:57.710 --> 18:00.113
(screams)

18:00.147 --> 18:02.182
The rope's tangled around
my arm, I'm falling in!

18:02.215 --> 18:03.150
Tranq the dinosaur!

18:03.183 --> 18:04.784
I can't get a line on her!

18:04.817 --> 18:06.186
Just point, aim and shoot.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.788
PAIGE:
You missed!

18:08.821 --> 18:09.856
It's harder than it looks.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.758
Dig your feet in the mud!

18:11.791 --> 18:12.725
I'm gonna reach into my pocket

18:12.759 --> 18:14.494
and get my pocket knife
and cut the rope!

18:14.527 --> 18:16.196
The thrashing of the water
is moving the boat.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.197
I-I can't aim!

18:17.230 --> 18:17.830
Just shoot it!
TOBY:
Shoot it!

18:18.865 --> 18:19.699
(shouts)

18:19.732 --> 18:20.900
Son of a bitch!

18:20.933 --> 18:21.701
Did you hit the target?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.836
Uh, not the one
I was aiming for.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.338
He shot me in the ass!

18:25.372 --> 18:27.174
It's not as easy as it looks!

18:27.207 --> 18:28.308
(grunting)

18:29.509 --> 18:30.643
Come on.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.678
Come on. All right.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.745
Come on, big fella.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.381
Okay. Happy, they're safe.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.815
What about
the prehistoric beast?

18:35.848 --> 18:36.516
(grunts)

18:36.549 --> 18:38.351
Just took a dart from his butt.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.819
The alligator, stupid.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.921
Oh. No, she got away.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.257
I got the dart out before
all the drugs discharged,

18:44.291 --> 18:45.925
but he's still got
a heavy sedative in him.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.294
We're gonna need an antidote

18:47.327 --> 18:48.461
before it hits
his nervous system.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.562
Ah, that's all right.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.730
Let's go.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.602
So about that antidote?

19:01.608 --> 19:02.909
(slurring):
Let's get those mosquitoes.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.345
TOBY:
Happy, you call Ditterman,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.480
and hurry up;
he should have the antivenin.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.249
Enough of this stuff interferes
enough with his nervous system,

19:09.282 --> 19:10.583
it'll kill him.
HAPPY:
Already dialed.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.553
You are a mile away
from Rural Route 32.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.455
If you can get Cabe
to that highway,

19:15.488 --> 19:16.956
I can tell Ditterman
to meet you with the antidote.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.825
All right. Uh, I'll take him,
you go get the gator.

19:18.858 --> 19:19.926
Okay.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.228
Be careful.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.462
Let's go, big fella.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.730
What's up, Doc?

19:23.763 --> 19:24.797
(laughs)

19:24.831 --> 19:26.199
Oh, boy.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.300
Guys, I got to go.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.535
I have Ditterman on the line.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.504
So we have T minus 24 minutes
to get our mosquitoes back.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.206
There are no more
tranquilizer darts,

19:33.240 --> 19:34.774
we've lost our surgeon,
and even if we find Yvonne,

19:34.807 --> 19:36.809
we won't be able to get
our tin back, anyway.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.645
Well, maybe we don't need
to get it from her.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.480
Maybe we can get her
to give it to us.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.415
Lobelia inflata
is native to the Southeast.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.817
It grows on the eucalyptus trees
found near the swamps.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.886
Come on, let's go.
Explain how giving the alligator

19:46.919 --> 19:48.655
a plant is going to
give us the box back.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.690
Well, because Lobelia inflata
is more commonly known

19:50.723 --> 19:52.959
by its layman's nickname:
the puke weed.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.227
(groans)

19:54.261 --> 19:55.662
And what exactly
is your relationship

19:55.695 --> 19:57.530
to Ms. Logan, Mr. Dodd?

19:57.564 --> 19:59.499
Brother? Uncle?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.734
I'm her alderman,
she's my intern.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.603
Okay, Mr. Dodd.

20:03.636 --> 20:07.006
Do you have any proof
of who slashed Patty's tires?

20:07.039 --> 20:10.510
Well, no, but I think
the note is crystal clear.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.679
It was retribution
for an alleged crossing

20:12.712 --> 20:14.581
of arbitrary societal lines.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.915
Now, if we
could compare

20:15.948 --> 20:18.585
the handwriting in the note
to the handwriting

20:18.618 --> 20:19.886
of these girls
that Patty has mentioned...

20:19.919 --> 20:21.554
This isn't CSI.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.256
We don't have
the resources

20:23.290 --> 20:24.924
for handwriting analysis.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.092
Now, I'll look into it,

20:26.125 --> 20:28.461
and if there is something
to be done, I'll handle it.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.596
How's that sound?

20:29.629 --> 20:31.931
Like bullnuggets.

20:31.964 --> 20:32.999
Excuse me?

20:33.032 --> 20:34.634
I've met you before.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.370
Your nameplate might
read "Ms. Carlisle,"

20:37.404 --> 20:39.706
but it might as well
read "Mr. Dinkins,"

20:39.739 --> 20:42.842
and you might as well be
a 68-year-old balding man

20:42.875 --> 20:44.411
with an overbite

20:44.444 --> 20:45.512
and a bad comb-over

20:45.545 --> 20:47.013
and absolutely
no intention

20:47.046 --> 20:49.349
of doing anything
about Buddy Hinkle stealing

20:49.382 --> 20:51.484
my Super Fun Guy lunch box
and throwing it up

20:51.518 --> 20:53.620
in the Japanese maple
on the playground.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.490
I think we've gotten off topic.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.758
No.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.328
I am perfectly on topic,
Ms. Carlisle.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.329
I am on the topic

21:02.362 --> 21:06.399
of bureaucrats who would
rather sit and wait out

21:06.433 --> 21:08.067
their last two years
until retirement

21:08.100 --> 21:09.902
instead of actually helping
the kids

21:09.936 --> 21:12.605
who need help.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.341
So I am done talking to you.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.875
What is the name
of Patty's guidance counselor?

21:15.908 --> 21:19.045
Uh, Mr. Gipmar.

21:19.078 --> 21:22.048
I suggest you get Gipmar 'cause
I'm sitting in your office

21:22.081 --> 21:24.817
and I'm not leaving
till I get my lunch box.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.654
There it is.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.556
The Lobelia inflata.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.790
PAIGE:
Oh, it's pretty high up.

21:30.823 --> 21:31.691
No way to scale that tree,

21:31.724 --> 21:32.759
so how do we get up there?

21:32.792 --> 21:33.760
Uh, what sort of equipment
do you have on the boat?

21:33.793 --> 21:36.062
A bunch of your husband's
Mardi Gras beads.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.897
Not really useful.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.634
Oh, I saw a tarp and some rope
for crawdad traps.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.969
Okay, I can work with that.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.971
Yeah, yeah, thanks, Doc,
we'll see you soon.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.673
Cabe, Ditterman's got
the antidote in hand.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.007
He's gonna meet us
on Route 32 ASAP,

21:48.040 --> 21:50.443
so we got to hustle.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.512
I got something in my ear.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.014
It's all right.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.083
You got something, too.

21:57.116 --> 21:57.950
What? No.
Stop it. Cabe.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
those are our comms!

22:01.053 --> 22:02.489
Let's just go.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.490
You okay?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.358
Come here. Why
don't you, uh,

22:05.392 --> 22:07.727
why don't you just
follow my lead here?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.662
Huh?
Here we go.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.632
You know what, Doc?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.634
This is what
life's all about.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.803
Taking care
of people you love.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.072
We need to take care
of each other.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.841
You're gonna learn
that soon...

22:21.874 --> 22:23.876
'cause you're...

22:23.910 --> 22:25.878
you're gonna be a dad.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.680
That's so awesome.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.982
That's so awesome.
Yeah.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.651
Came to the Big Easy to party

22:31.684 --> 22:34.887
and I'm the designated driver
for Tipsy McStumblepants.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.723
You know what else
is awesome?
Huh?

22:36.756 --> 22:39.392
Breakfast for dinner.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.695
Boop.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.432
I hate you.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.033
Okay, then you take
the end of the rope,

22:47.066 --> 22:48.134
you slide it through
the double-hitched knot,

22:48.167 --> 22:50.102
you put it through the A-hinge
of the crawdad trap,

22:50.136 --> 22:51.203
you wrap it
around the other side,

22:51.237 --> 22:53.072
and you repeat the steps
to act as a counterbalance.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.574
Happy, can you slow down?

22:54.607 --> 22:55.675
I'm trying to follow
your instructions,

22:55.708 --> 22:56.976
but you're going way too fast.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.411
Oh, God, this would be
so much easier

22:58.445 --> 22:59.378
if I was there to build it.

22:59.412 --> 23:02.114
Okay, you're the one
with the, uh, 197 IQ.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.249
Keep up.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.852
My area of expertise is not
mechanical engineering.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.854
Maybe if you could articulate
your ideas

23:07.887 --> 23:09.021
a little bit
better, then...

23:09.055 --> 23:10.690
No, you're right.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.692
I have no patience
for explaining things.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.427
Toby says the same thing.

23:14.461 --> 23:15.795
I am a sucky teacher.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.998
Actually, you're not.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.800
I see here that the mistake
was mine.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.936
I-I did a single-hitched knot
instead of a double-hitch

23:23.970 --> 23:26.506
like you said.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.707
So it's totally my fault.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.175
(mouthing)

23:29.208 --> 23:31.444
But if you could
slow it down a bit,

23:31.478 --> 23:33.780
I, uh, might be able to
get it right the next time

23:33.813 --> 23:36.483
and then we could
climb that tree

23:36.516 --> 23:37.984
and grab that puke weed.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.152
Okay. 20 minutes left
to make this happen.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.622
Let's start off
from the top again.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.691
You take the base
of the crawdad trap.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.625
That's gonna be your seat.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.160
(quietly):
Now, that's how you white-lie.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.463
Very proud of you.

23:53.566 --> 23:57.470
Brown mustard,
L.A. Kings,

23:57.504 --> 23:59.739
wind chimes,
and that's it.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.574
That's everything
that's awesome.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.510
Oh, is that all?
You sure?

24:03.543 --> 24:04.977
Well, I don't know.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.245
Maybe I'm
forgetting something.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.514
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Cabe!

24:07.547 --> 24:08.681
Come on, come on, man. Hey.

24:08.715 --> 24:09.716
Are you feeling all right?

24:11.751 --> 24:13.720
(groans)

24:13.753 --> 24:14.987
Answer appears to be no.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.523
(pants)

24:16.556 --> 24:18.224
(cars driving in distance)

24:18.257 --> 24:19.759
You hear that?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.595
That road can't be more
than a quarter mile away.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.663
Cabe, you know what?

24:23.696 --> 24:25.798
Um, stay here.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.967
I'm gonna go get Ditterman
and the antidote

24:28.000 --> 24:29.536
and I--
and I'll be right back. Okay?

24:29.569 --> 24:31.270
Awesome.
Don't move.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.540
Okay.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.274
(groans)

24:35.307 --> 24:37.777
TOBY: Aah! Cabe! Over
here, over here!

24:37.810 --> 24:39.111
Toby?!

24:39.145 --> 24:41.714
Cabe, hurry!

24:46.719 --> 24:47.987
What you doing?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.255
I'm in quicksand,
you idiot.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.256
Quicksand.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.658
I haven't seen quicksand

24:51.691 --> 24:52.759
since The Princess Bride.

24:52.792 --> 24:53.292
Now, that was

24:53.325 --> 24:55.227
an awesome movie.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.996
Don't fear, Buttercup.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.131
I will save you.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.500
I'm a dead man.

25:05.972 --> 25:09.208
Coming, buddy!

25:09.241 --> 25:09.876
Yeah.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.544
All right, now
pull me out.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.179
(grunts)

25:13.212 --> 25:15.047
Come on.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.583
(grunts, groans)

25:16.616 --> 25:18.751
I can't do it.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.152
Yeah, that's 'cause you're
hopped up on tranq juice.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.221
Oh, I'm really going down fast.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.556
Um, Cabe?

25:23.590 --> 25:25.658
Can you find a
vine or something?

25:25.692 --> 25:28.027
Okay, I'm on it.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.565
No, no, no, no! Forget about it.

25:32.599 --> 25:33.399
New plan.

25:33.432 --> 25:34.667
Forget about trying
to pull me out.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.935
You got to push me down.

25:35.968 --> 25:36.936
Fast!

25:36.969 --> 25:39.205
You want me to smother you
in the quicksand?

25:39.238 --> 25:40.873
No, quicksand's created
by underground water systems

25:40.907 --> 25:41.908
like rivers or streams.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.143
So I bet there's a stream
underneath this pit

25:44.176 --> 25:45.211
that runs to that
pond over there.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.879
So you want me to drown you?

25:46.913 --> 25:48.314
No, just find something heavy

25:48.347 --> 25:49.782
that's gonna
weigh me down quick,

25:49.816 --> 25:51.050
and I'm gonna fall
to the underground stream,

25:51.083 --> 25:54.020
I'll ride it to the pond, and
then I'll swim to the surface

25:54.053 --> 25:55.054
before I suffocate
or drown!

25:55.087 --> 25:56.723
Oh, man, that sounds scary.

25:56.756 --> 25:57.890
Go get the damn rock!

25:57.924 --> 26:00.192
Okay.

26:04.163 --> 26:07.700
(metal detector beeping)

26:07.734 --> 26:08.868
You hear that?

26:08.901 --> 26:09.936
Gator's nearby.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.138
Okay. (grunts)

26:12.171 --> 26:14.641
I'll grab the chicken.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.309
Get every last
bit in there.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.245
I hung from a crawdad
rope 20 feet in the air

26:19.278 --> 26:21.714
to get that crap.
Understood.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.049
I'll need your smart watch.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.885
You plan to text Yvonne?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.820
The watch is also
a tracking device.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.156
This way we won't risk
losing her again.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.692
Oh, you're making, like,
a real-life Tick-Tock Croc.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.027
Yeah.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.363
Peter Pan, when the crocodile
swallowed the alarm clock?

26:37.396 --> 26:39.231
I've never read it.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.868
Besides, Yvonne is an alligator,
not a croc.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.070
Crocs are on average
five feet longer

26:44.103 --> 26:46.405
and they tend to live
in saltwater habitats,

26:46.438 --> 26:48.107
while alligators prefer

26:48.140 --> 26:49.341
freshwater marshes.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.943
Don't ruin Peter Pan for me.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.114
Ping was over here.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.783
(metal detector whining)

26:56.816 --> 26:58.685
(Walter grunts)

27:04.156 --> 27:06.959
Here, gator, gator, gator.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.067
Aah.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.971
Okay, let's follow her.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.174
It's working. It's showing us

27:22.208 --> 27:24.143
exactly where Yvonne and
the mosquitoes are headed.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.445
12 minutes to go.
No time to waste.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.980
Okay. Let's follow that gator.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.122
Cabe! Where the hell
are you, man?!

27:36.155 --> 27:39.158
(panting)

27:39.191 --> 27:40.326
Where's the rock?!

27:40.359 --> 27:41.427
Where the hell
you been?!

27:41.460 --> 27:44.096
Well, I couldn't find
one large rock.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.933
But not to worry.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.935
I found a bunch of small ones.
Pebbles?!

27:48.968 --> 27:50.903
Pebbles do not help me!

27:50.937 --> 27:52.872
I always thought one of the
stupid ones were gonna kill me.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.306
I thought it was gonna be Paige.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.242
Cabe, come on, man.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.011
Stay with me. If I die, you got
to get to Route 32 by yourself.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.883
Oh, oh!

28:03.916 --> 28:05.151
Wasn't the weight
I was looking for,

28:05.184 --> 28:06.218
but you'll do.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.297
(gasps)

28:21.333 --> 28:24.971
(panting)

28:25.004 --> 28:26.873
Whoa! What just happened?!

28:26.906 --> 28:28.741
You just took the worst
water park ride ever.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.309
(panting)

28:30.342 --> 28:32.111
Ooh, I feel alert now!

28:32.144 --> 28:33.245
Yeah, that's an adrenaline rush.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.313
It's soon gonna wear off.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.948
It's a double-edged sword.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.150
The adrenaline's got your
heart pumping faster,

28:38.184 --> 28:42.822
which is gonna make the drug go
through your body faster, too.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.431
Watch stopped moving.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.067
Well, Yvonne would stop
to vomit.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.936
The puke weed worked faster
than we thought.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.337
Ugh, so gross.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.407
Okay, uh,
so she stopped moving

29:01.440 --> 29:04.510
somewhere underwater
around here.

29:04.543 --> 29:07.513
So, once she vomits, the tin
will float to the surface,

29:07.546 --> 29:10.082
so keep an eye out.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.922
There it is.
Okay, grab the net.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.960
Hold on.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.496
PAIGE:
Take it easy, Walter.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.532
Go slow.
WALTER: We have to hurry.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.902
We only have four minutes
to release the mosquitoes.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.105
Aah.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.907
(shouts)

29:34.941 --> 29:36.142
Paige!

29:36.175 --> 29:38.945
What happened?

29:38.978 --> 29:40.112
The-the boat must've hit
a tree stump.

29:40.146 --> 29:40.947
Are you okay?

29:40.980 --> 29:43.850
Yeah. There's the tin.
I'll get it.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.552
You get the boat off the stump.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.020
Okay.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.923
Okay.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.158
Okay, I got it.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.059
Okay, great work, Paige.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.394
(grunting):
Yeah, I got the boat free.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.500
(growls)

30:01.533 --> 30:03.936
Paige.

30:05.004 --> 30:08.174
The alligator
is right behind you.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.209
(Yvonne growling)

30:19.318 --> 30:21.320
Oh, God.

30:27.626 --> 30:30.863
Oh. What do I do?

30:32.264 --> 30:33.065
I've got three minutes

30:33.099 --> 30:34.066
before the mosquitoes
are useless,

30:34.100 --> 30:35.634
but if I move, Yvonne's gonna
freaking eat me.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.069
Don't move.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.604
The alligator's
attracted to splashing

30:38.637 --> 30:40.272
or any vibrations in the water.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.341
Get me the hell out of here.

30:43.609 --> 30:44.643
HAPPY:
Walt.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.178
The fanboat probably has

30:46.212 --> 30:47.646
a 500-horsepower engine,

30:47.679 --> 30:49.415
topping off at 45

30:49.448 --> 30:50.616
to 50 miles per hour.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.251
The gator tops off at 20.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.285
Do you follow?

30:53.319 --> 30:55.321
I do.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.905
(Yvonne growling)

31:15.107 --> 31:16.508
You're pissing off Yvonne.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.345
Hold on, Paige!
I'm gonna get you to safety.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.381
Happy's insane.
I can't water-ski barefoot.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.350
HAPPY:
You're not gonna water-ski.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.918
He's gonna drag your ass.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.954
(screaming)

31:31.323 --> 31:34.927
I feel alert now.
Just a little bit further.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.596
Ditterman's gonna meet us up
on the road. Come on.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.999
Cabe, man,
I'm really sorry.

31:40.032 --> 31:40.866
None of this
would've happened

31:40.899 --> 31:43.002
if I wasn't wearing
those stupid beads.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.636
I just thought, if Happy
might be pregnant,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.638
I can have one last hurrah
in New Orleans

31:46.672 --> 31:48.274
before the baby
comes, you know?

31:48.307 --> 31:50.109
One last time to be
wild and crazy

31:50.142 --> 31:52.144
before responsibility
sets in.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.681
I'd hate for my immaturity
to be your downfall.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.186
That's it.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.622
Here's the road. All right,
you're gonna make it, buddy.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.991
Move your feet, man.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.459
You got this.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.200
Are you kidding me?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.234
(grunts)
Oh! Oh!

32:15.267 --> 32:16.402
Cabe, Cabe!

32:16.435 --> 32:18.137
Come on, man.
Wake up.

32:18.170 --> 32:21.373
Cabe, come on, buddy.
Wake up.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.474
If you die on this trip,

32:22.508 --> 32:25.011
I'll never be able to enjoy
zydeco music ever again.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.013
Come on!

32:28.380 --> 32:29.681
Oh, Ditterman!

32:29.715 --> 32:31.950
Hey! Over here!

32:34.586 --> 32:36.455
I got it.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.764
It's not working. You sure
you grabbed the right syringe?

32:45.797 --> 32:48.600
It's the antivenin. I just
may have injected him too late.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.505
Wake up, Cabe, come on.

32:59.045 --> 33:01.247
Zydeco music sucks.

33:05.251 --> 33:08.354
You know, that really is
a quality rug you got there.

33:09.355 --> 33:12.124
He's still affected
by the drugs.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.137
Coming up to
the drop spot.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.239
Hurry, we have
12 seconds left!

33:27.273 --> 33:29.041
Okay. Let 'em go.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.543
Got it.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.712
(sighs)

33:33.745 --> 33:36.748
Just in time.

33:36.782 --> 33:37.949
They'll mate.

33:37.983 --> 33:42.254
Their offspring will be sterile.
Pandemic officially averted.

33:42.288 --> 33:45.391
Guys, I just heard from Toby.
Cabe is okay.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.693
Oh, thank God.
Can we please just go home?

33:47.726 --> 33:49.328
Yeah. Oh.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.263
Besides, we should
get back to L.A. soon.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.731
You don't want to miss
that lecture tonight.

33:52.764 --> 33:56.602
Oh, no... wouldn't want
to miss that.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.710
(school bell ringing)

34:08.847 --> 34:10.149
Our bikes...

34:10.182 --> 34:13.119
Who did this to us?

34:14.620 --> 34:17.123
Oh, no.

34:24.830 --> 34:25.931
Did you do this?

34:25.964 --> 34:28.667
I gave the mean girls a taste
of their own medicine.

34:31.337 --> 34:33.139
By vandalizing their bikes?

34:33.172 --> 34:34.406
I just locked them up.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.641
There's 20 locks
over there, Ralph.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.176
That's over two million
potential combinations

34:37.209 --> 34:39.245
to comb through.
Exactly.

34:39.278 --> 34:42.448
I came here to use diplomacy,
to talk to Patty's principal

34:42.481 --> 34:43.849
or her guidance counselor.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.684
How'd that work out for you?

34:49.555 --> 34:51.890
His mom is gonna kill him.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.359
What were you thinking?

34:53.392 --> 34:55.427
That those girls were cruel

34:55.461 --> 34:56.762
and they did a bad thing.

34:56.795 --> 34:57.863
And now you've done a bad thing.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.865
You can't respond to bullying
with more bullying.

34:59.898 --> 35:00.932
Why not?

35:00.966 --> 35:02.868
In physics, two negatives
often equal a positive.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.236
This isn't physics.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.438
And don't try to outsmart
the situation.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.340
Stupid behavior
plus stupid behavior

35:08.374 --> 35:09.708
just leads to more stupidity.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.910
But, Mom...
Quiet. Let me
ask you a question.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.180
Do you think those girls
will be nicer to Patty now?

35:14.213 --> 35:16.248
Or do you think that
they'll dislike her more?

35:17.283 --> 35:19.885
Did you help the problem
or exacerbate it?

35:22.454 --> 35:24.890
Over 200 IQ and you need me
to figure it out for you.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.626
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.329
You're gonna pay for any damage

35:30.362 --> 35:31.830
that may have happened
to those bikes.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.232
You're gonna apologize
to those girls,

35:33.265 --> 35:34.566
and you're gonna take
whatever punishment

35:34.600 --> 35:36.202
the principal thinks is right.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.905
In Ralph's defense,
the principal is a tool.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.907
Eavesdropper.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.652
Ralph.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.654
You're a good kid.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.256
Your heart was
in the right place.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.825
Thanks.
But...

35:59.858 --> 36:01.927
your head was up your butt.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.932
Thank you for what
you did today.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.934
Principal Carlisle
removed my tardy.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.237
She did?
Yes.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.639
On the condition that you
never visit her office again.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.941
Done and done.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.477
Heard some kids messed
with the queen bee's bikes.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.813
It wasn't me, just so you know.
I don't know who did it.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.350
Well, when you're mean,
you make enemies.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.717
Not saying it was right, though.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.987
Can I tell you something?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.223
Of course.

36:31.257 --> 36:34.260
Thing is, if I'm being honest,

36:34.293 --> 36:36.262
I don't have a lot of friends.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.464
I'm aware that my personality
is a bit intense

36:38.497 --> 36:41.267
and different
than the other kids.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.934
I'm sure you have plenty of...
I don't.

36:42.968 --> 36:46.338
But what I'm trying to say is,

36:46.372 --> 36:48.340
I'm thankful
that you're one of them.

36:50.276 --> 36:53.011
Patty, you have
loads of friends.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.313
Ralph, Paige,

36:54.346 --> 36:55.781
Walter, Toby,
the entire team.

36:55.814 --> 36:56.648
And that puts you

36:56.682 --> 36:59.318
way ahead of where
I was at your age.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.487
You had a tough time
in high school?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.955
The toughest.

37:03.989 --> 37:07.293
So it gets better?

37:07.326 --> 37:09.295
It gets so much better.

37:09.328 --> 37:11.463
Patty, you're gonna go on
to do great things.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.499
You're already
on your way.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.434
Trust me.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.469
I wouldn't lie to my friend.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.448
(groans)

37:29.481 --> 37:32.050
That stings.
Stop squirming.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.752
I think every pricker
bush in those woods

37:33.785 --> 37:35.421
took a bit out of
me today. (winces)

37:35.454 --> 37:37.423
So I thought you were gonna
stay down there a bit longer,

37:37.456 --> 37:39.891
get your party on in the bayou.

37:39.925 --> 37:40.892
No, I had a realization today.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.995
I, I realized that I don't want
to be the guy

37:44.029 --> 37:46.632
that wakes up shirtless
in a parked streetcar anymore.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.033
Metaphorically speaking?

37:48.066 --> 37:50.569
Yeah...

37:52.070 --> 37:54.406
I just... Having a baby
does not make you a man.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.942
Taking care of a baby
makes you a man.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.478
And I could barely care
for Cabe today,

37:59.511 --> 38:00.979
and the guy's almost 60.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.981
He almost drowned

38:03.014 --> 38:05.484
in quicksand today
because of me.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.885
I got to...

38:06.918 --> 38:09.355
I got to stop
with the childish antics

38:09.388 --> 38:13.058
and prepare to properly
take care of our future child.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.960
I get it.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.028
I had an eye-opening day myself.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.398
I thought I'd be okay
staying back,

38:19.431 --> 38:21.433
quarterbacking from the garage,

38:21.467 --> 38:23.101
but I went a little crazy.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.736
I like getting
my hands dirty,

38:24.770 --> 38:26.037
being in control.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.574
But having a baby means

38:28.607 --> 38:31.577
a lot of things will be
out of my control.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.612
That is a hard
adjustment to make,

38:33.645 --> 38:35.581
and I feel like...

38:35.614 --> 38:37.683
I'm losing a bit
of my identity.
Yeah.

38:37.716 --> 38:41.387
I think we both are.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.390
I'm gonna have to stop being
a man-boy all the time.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.724
And you're gonna have to stop

38:45.757 --> 38:47.459
being a controlasaurus
all the time.

38:49.395 --> 38:51.029
That might be a good
thing, you know?

38:51.062 --> 38:53.399
There's a lot of changes
coming our way.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.401
We got to make
some changes, too.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.541
Now stop squirming.

39:02.574 --> 39:03.842
(whimpers)

39:03.875 --> 39:04.643
Ah.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.912
Okay, Sly's gonna
take you home.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.080
I get to go to
a stimulating lecture

39:09.114 --> 39:11.082
on major loop deterrence?

39:11.116 --> 39:13.018
"Trigger Loop as
a Major Determinant

39:13.051 --> 39:14.420
of Transcriptional
Fidelity."

39:14.453 --> 39:16.087
That doesn't sound so bad.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.457
Oh, I'd rather be at the swamp
with the alligators.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.395
Uh, Paige,
uh, bad news.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.063
The lecture
was canceled.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.466
There's not as much interest
in the topic as they thought.

39:27.499 --> 39:30.402
Really? That's surprising.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.939
Yeah. It is. Uh... but it's
probably a good thing, right?

39:33.972 --> 39:36.107
You must be tired
after today.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.109
This way you can go home
with Ralph and rest.

39:38.143 --> 39:41.747
Yeah, that's too bad,
but I'm actually pretty spent.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.114
Being dragged
through the swamp

39:43.148 --> 39:47.152
is draining, so it's
probably for the best.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.421
Okay, well,
get some rest.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.589
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.424
Tomorrow it is.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.059
Okay, Ralph, let's go.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.197
(door swings open)

39:59.230 --> 40:01.433
(door closes)

40:03.502 --> 40:05.103
Oh, hey, guys.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.472
Have plans tonight?

40:06.505 --> 40:07.939
Uh, staying in,
taking it easy.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.140
Order some pizza.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.742
Okay, well, enjoy your pizza.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.444
Uh, I'll see you in the morning.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.179
Smell you later, 197.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.081
What happened
to losing the man-boy?

40:16.114 --> 40:18.650
"Smell you later" is a
classic, goes nowhere.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.218
Do you...?

40:20.251 --> 40:23.088
Hey, guys.
What are you doing?

40:23.121 --> 40:24.623
I'm gonna make sure
Patty gets home safe,

40:24.656 --> 40:26.024
and then I'm gonna
go check on Cabe.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.026
Okay. Have a good night.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.095
See you later, Walter.
Bye, Walt.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.583
(phone chimes)

40:53.284 --> 40:55.220
Excellent.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.661
(car door opens)

41:02.694 --> 41:03.995
Hey.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.664
(car door closes)
I'm glad you could make it.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.766
I thought this topic
might be of interest to you.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.201
I'm sorry it was
such short notice.

41:10.235 --> 41:13.238
Are you kidding me? This lecture
has been sold out for months.

41:13.271 --> 41:14.873
I'm psyched.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.776
Wonderful. Well, let's go have
a stimulating evening.
