WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.134
Good morning
to all creatures

00:03.202 --> 00:04.435
great and... small.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.337
You're in a frothy mood.

00:06.372 --> 00:07.606
Yeah, well, Harvey
promised me

00:07.673 --> 00:09.340
a romantic surprise
for this weekend.

00:09.408 --> 00:10.508
Ooh.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.577
Another heart-shaped corn dog?

00:12.645 --> 00:13.811
Hey, that was good.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.280
When he says romantic,
does he mean Brad-free?

00:16.349 --> 00:18.649
Yep, just me, my guy
and no witch hunter.

00:18.717 --> 00:21.787
And if dinner comes on a stick,
it's fine with me.

00:21.854 --> 00:24.089
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
enough chick talk.

00:24.123 --> 00:25.856
Sabrina, as man of the house,
I insist

00:25.924 --> 00:27.492
you let me spend the weekend

00:27.559 --> 00:29.894
watching rootin' tootin'
Westerns on your TV.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.096
Once again, Salem,
your approach

00:31.163 --> 00:32.497
is as pathetic
as it is appalling,

00:32.564 --> 00:34.031
but here's how good
a mood I'm in.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.036
(gasps)

00:39.105 --> 00:42.140
(Western movie playing)
Yes! Cowpokes, cattle,

00:42.208 --> 00:46.144
manly men in mortal combat
with even manlier men!

00:46.179 --> 00:49.614
Oh... these pillows
are so cuddly soft.

00:49.682 --> 00:50.682
(chuckling)

01:32.725 --> 01:35.927
Hey. Ready for
your romantic surprise?

01:35.994 --> 01:38.396
Reassure me that it doesn't
suddenly involve Brad.

01:38.464 --> 01:39.430
Only indirectly.

01:39.498 --> 01:40.765
Oh, but you promised
it was just going

01:40.833 --> 01:41.700
to be us this weekend.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.467
Brad's lending me his skis.

01:43.535 --> 01:44.702
But you... Skis?

01:44.770 --> 01:46.837
As in, we're
going skiing?

01:46.905 --> 01:49.073
One of my dad's
extermination customers

01:49.141 --> 01:50.441
owns a mountain cabin.

01:50.509 --> 01:52.510
He's giving it to us
for the weekend.

01:52.578 --> 01:53.945
I never knew
pest control

01:54.013 --> 01:55.547
could lead to
such romance.

01:55.615 --> 01:59.917
Mm. Powdery slopes, warm
firesides, whispering pines

01:59.985 --> 02:02.620
and, of course,
my mom and dad.

02:02.688 --> 02:03.688
Of course.

02:03.755 --> 02:05.623
But we can drive up together
tomorrow after school,

02:05.691 --> 02:06.724
just the two of us.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.092
My folks
are going up tonight,

02:08.160 --> 02:09.728
so my dad can kill
the roaches.

02:09.794 --> 02:11.329
So we don't even have
to drive in the back

02:11.397 --> 02:13.031
of the station wagon
with the dog smell?

02:13.099 --> 02:15.433
This is by far the
most romantic idea
you've ever had.

02:15.501 --> 02:16.400
Thank you.

02:18.604 --> 02:19.537
Hot coffee!

02:21.140 --> 02:22.607
What happened?

02:22.675 --> 02:24.242
Wow, lively floorboard.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.310
Did you see that?

02:26.478 --> 02:27.845
No, no, no, no.
Sabrina--

02:27.913 --> 02:29.314
she did something.

02:29.381 --> 02:31.849
She's all the way
across the room.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.853
Of all the coffeehouses

02:34.887 --> 02:36.121
in all the towns
in all the world,

02:36.188 --> 02:38.189
that witch hunter
has to walk into mine.

02:40.292 --> 02:41.593
Hey, good news.
You don't have

02:41.661 --> 02:42.993
to loiter nervously
in the hallway

02:43.061 --> 02:44.395
making small talk
with my aunts

02:44.463 --> 02:45.797
because I am
entirely ready.

02:45.865 --> 02:46.865
Great.

02:46.932 --> 02:49.534
There was one tiny problem,
but it's already solved.

02:49.601 --> 02:50.768
Hey.

02:50.836 --> 02:52.570
Brad?

02:52.638 --> 02:54.372
He's just going to drive
us up to the mountains,

02:54.439 --> 02:56.307
then turn around and
drive all the way back.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.642
Is that
a friend or what?

02:57.709 --> 02:58.676
I'll get your stuff.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.011
It's better

03:00.079 --> 03:01.312
than not going, right?

03:01.380 --> 03:02.447
Okay, look.

03:02.514 --> 03:04.115
I got a date with
Susan McCormick tonight

03:04.182 --> 03:06.384
and her curfew is 10:30,
so if we leave right now

03:06.452 --> 03:09.220
I can get back in time for a
good, solid, 20-minute date.

03:09.287 --> 03:10.154
You know what?

03:10.222 --> 03:11.823
I'm not as ready
as I thought I was.

03:11.890 --> 03:12.957
I'll be right back.

03:13.024 --> 03:15.994
Ten-minute date.

03:16.061 --> 03:17.262
I'm going to be
in the car with Brad

03:17.329 --> 03:18.329
for over two hours!

03:18.397 --> 03:19.263
What if I use my magic?

03:19.331 --> 03:20.198
What if you don't?

03:20.266 --> 03:21.432
What if I point
without thinking,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.067
like I did at the coffeehouse
the other day?

03:23.135 --> 03:24.603
I mean, all Brad has to do
is look at me

03:24.670 --> 03:25.904
and say, "You're a witch"

03:25.971 --> 03:27.571
and I get turned into a mouse
for a hundred years!

03:27.639 --> 03:31.409
Aunt Zelda, Aunt Hilda,
I think I'm lost!

03:31.476 --> 03:32.410
(hawk screeching)

03:32.478 --> 03:33.544
(mouse shrieking)

03:33.612 --> 03:35.213
Don't panic.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.580
Oh, I'm way past panic
and looking

03:36.648 --> 03:38.149
for a parking space near <i>terror.</i>

03:38.216 --> 03:39.818
Since Brad's
witch-hunter gene

03:39.885 --> 03:41.920
is affected by
atmospheric conditions,

03:41.987 --> 03:43.221
I suggest we consult

03:43.288 --> 03:44.555
the Witch Weather Channel.

03:44.623 --> 03:47.091
(gunfire, horses neighing)

03:47.159 --> 03:49.059
SALEM:
Hey!

03:49.127 --> 03:52.030
Let's see, factoring in
high and low pressure systems,

03:52.097 --> 03:54.265
the magnetic influence
of the asteroid belt

03:54.333 --> 03:55.766
and the pollen count,

03:55.834 --> 03:58.769
unless things shift drastically,
Brad's witch-hunting gene

03:58.837 --> 04:00.805
won't be active
for the next 72 hours.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.140
And it looks like a good weekend
to plant bulbs.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.376
We interrupt this pabulum
to return

04:05.443 --> 04:08.212
to the Howard Hawkes classic,
<i>Rio Bravo.</i>
( <i>remote control clicks</i> )

04:08.280 --> 04:09.914
I'm sure it's safe for
you to ride with Brad

04:09.982 --> 04:11.682
and even safe for
you to use your magic.

04:11.750 --> 04:12.883
Just be careful.

04:12.951 --> 04:14.752
But, as an extra
safety precaution,

04:14.820 --> 04:16.019
take Salem with you.

04:16.088 --> 04:17.355
Salem?
Salem?

04:17.423 --> 04:19.589
Oh, throw the witch hunter off
with a talking cat?

04:19.658 --> 04:21.024
Well, it's hard
to believe,

04:21.093 --> 04:23.127
but Salem was an
experienced witch
for many years.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.995
And as a cat,
he's particularly sensitive

04:25.063 --> 04:26.864
to subtle changes
in the atmosphere.

04:26.932 --> 04:28.867
And we get rid of him
for the whole weekend.

04:28.934 --> 04:32.203
But I haven't seen
Angie Dickinson yet.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.905
You're bringing your cat?

04:33.973 --> 04:34.973
Uh, yeah. Allergies.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.207
He needs mountain air.

04:36.275 --> 04:37.775
Ahem.
His poor lungs--

04:37.842 --> 04:39.743
clogged with
pollution.

04:39.811 --> 04:40.778
Date with
Susan McCormick.

04:40.846 --> 04:41.779
Let's move it.

04:43.315 --> 04:45.115
Wear your seat belts.

04:45.183 --> 04:47.786
Observe
all posted traffic signs.

04:47.853 --> 04:49.086
And watch for ice

04:49.154 --> 04:51.089
and don't pass
on mountain roads.

04:51.156 --> 04:53.257
Have fun?

04:53.325 --> 04:55.693
Well, that's implied.

04:55.761 --> 04:57.028
You know, Hilda?

04:57.096 --> 04:59.630
Brad's witch-hunting gene
has set me thinking.

04:59.698 --> 05:04.135
What if Jupiter, Saturn
and Neptune were all to align

05:04.203 --> 05:06.837
within the ninth parallel
of the seventh quadrant,

05:06.905 --> 05:08.606
and we lose all our powers?

05:08.674 --> 05:10.407
That happens once a millennium.

05:10.475 --> 05:12.076
Yes, but what if it happened?

05:12.144 --> 05:13.744
And then there was a flood?

05:13.812 --> 05:14.945
We have no idea how

05:15.013 --> 05:17.548
to survive a natural disaster
without magic.

05:17.616 --> 05:19.917
I can't even make
an English muffin without magic.

05:19.985 --> 05:23.053
Precisely, which is why
I think we should prepare now

05:23.121 --> 05:24.622
before a disaster occurs.

05:24.690 --> 05:27.158
It's like the story of
the ant and the grasshopper.

05:27.226 --> 05:28.526
Oh, I don't know
that story.

05:28.593 --> 05:29.994
Of course you
know that story.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.496
There was this
hardworking ant

05:31.497 --> 05:33.064
and this lazy,
lazy grasshopper

05:33.132 --> 05:34.465
and winter was coming.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.967
I lied and I left,

05:36.101 --> 05:38.135
and it still
didn't stop her.

05:42.174 --> 05:44.242
Nobody's saying anything.

05:44.309 --> 05:45.710
Guys just don't say much

05:45.778 --> 05:47.812
when they ride
in cars together.

05:47.879 --> 05:49.279
Why?

05:49.347 --> 05:50.782
Are you going to talk

05:50.849 --> 05:51.715
the whole way?

05:51.783 --> 05:54.685
Better than not going.

05:58.223 --> 05:59.123
Radio's busted.

05:59.191 --> 06:00.591
Oh, well, maybe I can fix it.

06:00.659 --> 06:03.094
Unless there's some
changing atmospheric conditions

06:03.162 --> 06:04.528
that would make it unsafe

06:04.596 --> 06:05.529
to fix the radio?

06:05.597 --> 06:07.598
Here goes nothing.

06:10.636 --> 06:11.502
(music plays)

06:11.570 --> 06:13.170
Nice!

06:13.238 --> 06:14.305
How'd you do that?
I'm sorry.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.941
I don't talk in cars.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.143
Now that you got that working,

06:18.210 --> 06:19.610
I can listen
to my favorite show.

06:19.678 --> 06:21.879
<i>Sox Talk.</i>
And nothing but.

06:21.947 --> 06:24.014
SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
Prepare for another
great Red Sox season...

06:29.555 --> 06:31.555
I've grown accustomed
to the couch, but this

06:31.623 --> 06:32.690
may be interesting.

06:32.758 --> 06:33.992
I'm practicing

06:34.059 --> 06:36.894
in case we're ever caught
somewhere without our magic,

06:36.962 --> 06:39.096
and we have
to construct our own shelter.

06:39.164 --> 06:40.164
Where'd you get the tent?

06:40.232 --> 06:41.632
I zapped it in.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.400
The stores were closed,

06:43.468 --> 06:45.169
but we're going
to pitch it ourselves.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.338
No, you're going
to pitch it.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.206
I'm going to the kitchen
to make a cup of tea

06:49.274 --> 06:52.043
and wait for you
to recover from your episode.

06:54.312 --> 06:55.212
I can see my own breath in here.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.347
Can we turn on the heat?

06:56.415 --> 06:58.049
Heater's busted.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.617
Maybe Sabrina can fix it.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.018
She fixed your radio.

07:01.086 --> 07:04.689
( <i>Salem snoring</i> )

07:04.756 --> 07:06.090
Huh, huh? Meow!

07:07.258 --> 07:08.459
Hey! What are
those sparks?!

07:08.527 --> 07:09.961
Uh, static electricity?

07:10.028 --> 07:12.229
No way! It came
out of your finger!

07:12.297 --> 07:13.197
Hey, Brad, look out!

07:13.265 --> 07:14.798
(screaming)

07:16.068 --> 07:17.902
(wind whistling)

07:20.572 --> 07:21.973
Is everybody okay?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.340
Yeah, well, I didn't hear
a voice say,

07:23.408 --> 07:25.376
"Go into the light, Sabrina,"
so I guess I'm fine.

07:25.443 --> 07:27.545
(starter cranking)

07:27.613 --> 07:28.879
Let's go see
what's wrong.

07:28.947 --> 07:30.214
Did you see that?

07:30.282 --> 07:32.349
You did something
with your finger.

07:32.417 --> 07:35.853
Oh, so now I can't
pick my nose or talk?

07:40.191 --> 07:41.159
What happened?

07:41.227 --> 07:42.494
According to
my bum knee,

07:42.561 --> 07:44.228
there was an
atmospheric shift.

07:44.296 --> 07:46.998
The witch-hunter
gene is active.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.533
You never should
have tried magic.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.167
But you were supposed
to warn me.

07:50.235 --> 07:51.769
I was supposed
to be in the middle

07:51.837 --> 07:53.170
of <i>Stagecoach</i> right now!

07:53.238 --> 07:56.240
Hey, who are you
arguing with?

07:56.308 --> 07:57.941
Uh, the radio.

07:58.009 --> 08:00.678
I think the Red Sox
<i>will</i> win the pennant.

08:00.745 --> 08:02.747
You didn't even
try to help me.

08:02.814 --> 08:04.181
I'm leaving that
to your therapist.

08:04.249 --> 08:07.185
Oh, come on, you'll love
what I've done with the place.

08:08.354 --> 08:12.223
Oh, well,
this is kind of cozy.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.891
I wonder what it's like

08:13.959 --> 08:16.194
with the door closed
all the way.

08:16.261 --> 08:18.729
A body bag.

08:18.797 --> 08:21.265
If you don't like my
lifesaving tent, you can leave.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.567
The zipper's stuck.

08:23.635 --> 08:25.169
You can't do <i>anything</i>
for yourself.

08:25.237 --> 08:26.570
Oh, I'll just
zap it open.

08:26.638 --> 08:28.572
No, we can figure it out.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.778
Oh, I see. The
scientific approach.

08:37.782 --> 08:40.684
(Salem sobbing)

08:40.753 --> 08:43.254
Is that cat crying?

08:43.322 --> 08:44.454
No, that's its meow.

08:44.522 --> 08:46.757
I got it
at a really cheap pet store.

08:47.492 --> 08:48.992
Zap in a magic compass

08:49.060 --> 08:50.060
or a helicopter

08:50.128 --> 08:51.795
or at least warm socks.

08:54.065 --> 08:54.798
I can't do magic.

08:54.866 --> 08:56.534
I could be turned into a mouse.

08:56.601 --> 08:59.103
Then we're going to die.

09:03.074 --> 09:05.642
Hey, look.
A fire tower!

09:05.710 --> 09:07.611
There's got to be
a forest ranger up there

09:07.679 --> 09:09.580
or at least a phone.

09:13.251 --> 09:14.284
This looks kind of old.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.321
Well, if you big, strong men
are scared,

09:16.355 --> 09:17.989
I'll just go up by myself.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.428
I'm not scared.

09:24.496 --> 09:26.097
Me, either.

09:26.165 --> 09:28.566
(wolves howling)

09:47.252 --> 09:48.219
Great.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.553
It's abandoned.

09:49.621 --> 09:50.955
Not necessarily.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.090
Maybe the ranger's
just a terrible housekeeper.

09:55.026 --> 09:57.995
Uh, I have to go down.
I forgot something.

09:58.063 --> 10:00.164
What?
I forgot I'm afraid of heights.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.234
(screaming)

10:03.302 --> 10:05.803
(grunting)

10:05.871 --> 10:08.805
Okay, okay. We're trapped,
and we're way off the ground.

10:08.873 --> 10:10.041
Hang in there, man.

10:10.108 --> 10:13.144
Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea after all.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.079
(Salem sobbing)

10:15.147 --> 10:17.948
What was that?
(feigns crying):
Me-e-e-e-e...

10:18.050 --> 10:20.551
but I'll pull myself together.

10:20.519 --> 10:21.319
(groans)

10:21.386 --> 10:22.686
I know.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.888
ZELDA:
Let's go to the kitchen
and get a knife

10:24.956 --> 10:26.156
and cut ourselves out.

10:26.224 --> 10:27.191
HILDA:
I'll wait here.

10:27.259 --> 10:30.227
No. Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.

10:30.295 --> 10:31.562
(doorbell chiming)

10:31.630 --> 10:33.864
ZELDA:
No, oh, oh, for heaven's sakes.

10:33.932 --> 10:35.699
Oh! Concentrate.

10:35.767 --> 10:37.368
I'll just zap it.

10:41.206 --> 10:42.139
Oh!
(chiming continues)

10:42.207 --> 10:43.908
See? You needed
magic, didn't you!

10:43.975 --> 10:46.410
Oh, pipe down.

10:46.478 --> 10:47.712
Not you.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.447
Depending, of course,
on who you are.

10:49.514 --> 10:51.148
Perhaps you need to pipe down.

10:51.216 --> 10:52.482
(cackles)

10:52.551 --> 10:53.784
Who are you?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.354
Frank Alcerro. Brad's father.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.924
I've called five times,
but there was no answer.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.525
What's with the tent?

11:01.627 --> 11:04.562
We were, uh, practicing
our survival techniques.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.529
We had no idea

11:05.597 --> 11:07.031
what a hostile
environment

11:07.099 --> 11:08.632
our living room
could be.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.034
Try the Mekong Delta.

11:11.637 --> 11:12.970
I've heard about this house.

11:13.038 --> 11:15.739
People say a lot of
weird things go on here.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.774
I think what you heard

11:16.875 --> 11:19.176
is "weird people say
things go on here."

11:19.211 --> 11:22.512
Um, what can we do
for you, Mr. Alcerro?

11:22.580 --> 11:24.282
We got a call
from the Kinkles.

11:24.349 --> 11:27.251
The kids are late getting
to the cabin.
Oh, dear.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.318
I'm sure it's fine.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.720
We called the sheriff.

11:29.788 --> 11:31.021
No deaths reported.

11:31.089 --> 11:32.122
Hooray.

11:32.224 --> 11:33.223
He's going to keep an eye out.

11:33.291 --> 11:34.391
Don't think you need to worry.

11:34.459 --> 11:35.225
You got any coffee?

11:35.260 --> 11:36.159
Uh, sure.

11:36.227 --> 11:37.728
Um, black?

11:37.796 --> 11:39.062
And real.

11:39.131 --> 11:41.098
I don't go for that
wimpy, decaf stuff.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.466
Same here.

11:42.533 --> 11:45.002
The hard stuff for me,
out of a dirty mug.

11:45.103 --> 11:47.204
Excuse us.

11:48.506 --> 11:51.341
I'll just zap myself to Sabrina,
and make sure she's okay.

11:51.409 --> 11:52.977
Ow!

11:53.044 --> 11:55.079
Hilda, that is Brad's
father out there.

11:55.146 --> 11:56.446
Brad is a witch hunter.

11:56.514 --> 11:58.382
That means his
father probably has

11:58.449 --> 11:59.950
the witch-hunting gene.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.318
He's already
suspicious of us.

12:01.386 --> 12:04.021
Perhaps because we're camping
next to our piano.

12:04.089 --> 12:05.623
The weather must
have changed.

12:05.691 --> 12:07.391
We can't risk
doing magic or...

12:07.458 --> 12:08.625
HILDA:
Maybe you're right about him
being a witch-hunter.

12:08.693 --> 12:09.794
ZELDA:
You think?

12:09.861 --> 12:10.761
(hawk screeching)

12:10.829 --> 12:12.863
(mice shrieking)

12:12.931 --> 12:14.231
So what are we
supposed to do?

12:14.299 --> 12:17.968
Just stand around
and worry like ordinary mortals?

12:18.036 --> 12:19.236
That blows.

12:19.204 --> 12:22.639
Help!
Help!
Help!

12:22.674 --> 12:23.574
It's no use.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.676
There's no one around.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.578
It's getting colder.

12:27.646 --> 12:30.047
We should have stayed
in the truck.

12:30.115 --> 12:32.549
At least it's got a heater
and a radio.

12:32.618 --> 12:33.651
Thanks to me.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.786
For the record, how long did
those soccer players

12:35.854 --> 12:38.722
have to stay in the Andes before
they started eating each other?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.925
SALEM: No heat,
no blankets--

12:40.993 --> 12:43.226
we'll freeze
to death.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.062
Oh, why didn't I eat
more NutRageous Bars

12:45.130 --> 12:46.230
when I had the chance?

12:46.298 --> 12:47.531
(sobbing)

12:47.599 --> 12:48.365
(blows nose)

12:49.868 --> 12:53.170
Bloody nose.
Must be the high altitude.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.538
HARVEY:
Hey, look.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.006
Maybe we can call

12:56.074 --> 12:57.708
for help on this.

12:57.810 --> 13:00.010
(clicking switches)

13:00.078 --> 13:02.279
Great. It's busted.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.814
Hey, maybe Sabrina
can fix it.

13:03.882 --> 13:05.649
She fixed the radio
in your car.

13:07.185 --> 13:10.220
Come on, you're
our only hope.

13:15.527 --> 13:16.627
Great.

13:16.694 --> 13:19.363
I get to disappoint
everyone, then die.

13:21.165 --> 13:22.133
(phone beeps)

13:22.200 --> 13:23.934
Please help yourself
to our phone.

13:24.002 --> 13:27.305
I just talked
to Kinkle again.

13:27.372 --> 13:28.739
No sign of the kids.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.207
I think I'll drive up there.

13:30.275 --> 13:32.176
I don't like to just sit around
and wait for trouble to happen.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.311
What a refreshing attitude.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.881
Besides, this old dump
gives me the creeps.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.016
And it seems
to attract them.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.317
Mr. Alcerro, please wait.

13:40.385 --> 13:42.052
Let him go,
and when he's gone,

13:42.087 --> 13:44.288
we'll zap ourselves
to Sabrina.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.490
But what if we materialize
right next to Brad?

13:46.592 --> 13:48.025
He'd identify us as witches

13:48.093 --> 13:49.893
and we'd all be turned
into mice.

13:49.961 --> 13:51.361
Bad plan.

13:51.429 --> 13:52.964
Sabrina is all alone up
there with a witch hunter,

13:53.031 --> 13:54.265
and another one
is on the way.

13:54.332 --> 13:56.032
We've got to go up
there to protect her.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.268
Mr. Alcerro, we're
going with you.

13:58.336 --> 13:59.837
Bring some gas money.

13:59.938 --> 14:02.373
I'll stay here
and fold up the tent.

14:02.441 --> 14:05.309
Oh, well, I thought you two
wanted to be alone together.

14:06.644 --> 14:09.146
Try sparking those
two wires together.

14:09.213 --> 14:10.647
Well, then the whole thing
will be on fire.

14:10.715 --> 14:12.483
And we'd be warm!

14:12.551 --> 14:13.384
Hey, any luck?

14:13.451 --> 14:16.520
Brad thinks one of his toes
feels frostbitten.

14:16.588 --> 14:17.921
Oh, and I suppose
that's my fault, too?

14:17.989 --> 14:19.656
I'm not interested in
whose fault this is.

14:19.724 --> 14:21.325
Although if you want
to get technical,

14:21.393 --> 14:22.926
it was your idea
to climb up here.

14:22.994 --> 14:24.227
It wasn't my idea
to go skiing

14:24.295 --> 14:26.363
and it wasn't my stupid car
that wouldn't start.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.899
Again, not interested
in blaming anyone.

14:30.235 --> 14:31.835
My paw has turned black!

14:31.903 --> 14:33.637
Your paw's always black.

14:33.705 --> 14:34.705
Duh!

14:34.839 --> 14:36.107
I can't get this
stupid thing to work.

14:36.174 --> 14:38.441
(radio static crackles)

14:38.509 --> 14:39.510
It's working!

14:39.578 --> 14:41.712
Huh, and they say violence
never solves anything.

14:43.948 --> 14:45.449
Relax, ladies.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.184
I'm ready for anything
in this baby.

14:47.251 --> 14:48.518
Well, that's good to hear.

14:48.586 --> 14:51.255
You know, I've been trying
to impress upon my sister

14:51.322 --> 14:53.791
the importance of being
prepared for disaster.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.693
I've got enough food to last
four months in this rig.

14:56.761 --> 14:57.628
Oh, great.

14:57.695 --> 14:59.663
So if we get hit by an asteroid
right now,

14:59.731 --> 15:02.466
we die with enough powdered milk
to last until April.

15:04.035 --> 15:05.903
(static crackling)

15:05.970 --> 15:07.438
Hello. Is anybody there?

15:07.506 --> 15:08.372
BOY:
Hello?

15:08.507 --> 15:09.707
Hey, we got someone!

15:09.774 --> 15:13.477
See? She's not going
to get us killed.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.945
We're stuck in
an abandoned fire tower,

15:15.013 --> 15:17.014
and we need to talk to your
mother or your father

15:17.082 --> 15:19.616
or your step-parents, depending
on your family situation.

15:19.684 --> 15:21.718
I'm not supposed
to play with this radio.

15:21.786 --> 15:22.686
If I do, my dad yells.

15:22.753 --> 15:24.254
But this is an emergency!

15:24.322 --> 15:25.990
We're stuck, we're freezing,
and we can't get down!

15:26.058 --> 15:27.391
You're yelling at me!

15:27.459 --> 15:29.226
Over and out!

15:29.294 --> 15:29.893
(fizzling)

15:32.730 --> 15:34.764
Don't yell at me.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.635
Why are we stopping?

15:38.704 --> 15:40.971
Did we get a flat
in our giant tires?

15:41.039 --> 15:43.273
Snow. Have to put the chains on.

15:43.341 --> 15:45.575
Oh, well, can you
leave the heater on, please,

15:45.643 --> 15:46.710
while you go
out there?
Yeah.

15:46.778 --> 15:47.844
I got a cracked vertebra.

15:47.912 --> 15:49.580
Either you two put them on,
or we turn back.

15:49.648 --> 15:50.581
Oh, good.

15:50.648 --> 15:52.249
Since we can't
use our magic,

15:52.317 --> 15:55.118
this will be an excellent
learning experience.

15:55.186 --> 15:56.420
Just so you know,

15:56.487 --> 15:58.588
I'm not getting you anything
for your birthday.

15:58.656 --> 16:00.424
(wind whistling)

16:04.162 --> 16:06.263
My lungs have never
been cold before.

16:06.331 --> 16:08.265
I think we should
share the cat.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.000
No!
No!

16:10.068 --> 16:11.969
Uh, he has issues with men.

16:12.036 --> 16:14.271
You know, you could be
a little nicer to Brad.

16:14.339 --> 16:16.540
After all, it's not
his fault we're up here.

16:16.607 --> 16:18.842
Wish I had never agreed
to this stupid trip.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.044
I wish I'd never asked you
on this stupid trip.

16:21.112 --> 16:23.947
You know, this is definitely not
better than not going.

16:24.015 --> 16:25.448
Oh!

16:25.516 --> 16:27.050
We're going down.

16:28.286 --> 16:30.654
Ah! Ah!

16:30.722 --> 16:31.755
We did it!

16:31.823 --> 16:34.557
I feel such a sense
of accomplishment.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.626
We're empowered now, Hilda.

16:36.695 --> 16:39.530
We'll never be stuck
in the snow again.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.900
Okay. Fire her up!

16:44.002 --> 16:45.402
Oh!

16:49.540 --> 16:53.010
And nothing for Christmas.

16:53.078 --> 16:54.611
Don't move!

16:54.679 --> 16:56.113
I'm sorry we had a fight.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.147
I am, too.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.283
If I have to fall
to an untimely death

16:59.351 --> 17:00.684
in the middle of nowhere,

17:00.751 --> 17:03.120
I'd rather do it with
you than anyone else.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.721
Except maybe a paramedic.

17:04.789 --> 17:06.490
Salem, freeze!

17:06.558 --> 17:09.960
Wow, that's
a well-trained cat.

17:10.027 --> 17:12.662
All right, you've made
it clear that you
don't want to stop,

17:12.730 --> 17:14.298
but do you think
that we could use

17:14.365 --> 17:17.000
one of your 200 rolls
of toilet paper
to dry off with?

17:17.068 --> 17:18.867
Nope.
Don't want to break the seal.

17:18.935 --> 17:19.803
(shrieks)

17:19.871 --> 17:22.106
You can catch more
flies with honey

17:22.174 --> 17:23.106
than with vinegar.

17:24.409 --> 17:26.175
Do you have a rag we could use?

17:26.243 --> 17:27.644
Sure.

17:27.712 --> 17:30.714
Thank you so very much.

17:30.781 --> 17:33.550
Imagine the flies you can catch
with that rag.

17:33.618 --> 17:35.652
(loud creaking)

17:35.720 --> 17:38.288
Oh, no!

17:38.356 --> 17:39.422
What am I going to do?

17:39.490 --> 17:40.623
I can't cast a spell.

17:40.691 --> 17:42.559
I'll be turned into a mouse
for a hundred years.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.428
This is it.

17:44.496 --> 17:45.562
We're going over.

17:45.630 --> 17:46.463
That's it.

17:46.531 --> 17:47.564
I gotta save you guys.

17:47.599 --> 17:48.999
I don't care what
happens to me.

17:49.067 --> 17:52.068
I promise, while you're a mouse,
I won't eat you.

17:55.606 --> 17:57.407
(screaming)

18:03.982 --> 18:04.915
(yelling)

18:05.984 --> 18:07.251
(grunting)
(grunting)

18:08.986 --> 18:11.121
Is everyone okay?

18:11.189 --> 18:12.256
Fine.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.191
Wow, the snow must have
broken our fall.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.225
But we fell 50 feet.

18:15.292 --> 18:16.527
How can we all be fine?

18:16.595 --> 18:17.561
Clean living?

18:17.629 --> 18:18.395
No, no, no, no.

18:18.462 --> 18:20.497
This is all too weird.

18:20.564 --> 18:24.668
First she fixed my radio
without even using any tools,

18:24.736 --> 18:26.169
and then when she
fixed my heater,

18:26.237 --> 18:28.339
I swear I saw sparks
fly out of her finger.

18:28.406 --> 18:30.274
Oh, and you'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

18:30.342 --> 18:35.045
And I swear that darn cat
of hers was talking.

18:35.112 --> 18:36.813
And then the whole
tower blows over,

18:36.881 --> 18:38.949
and we come out of it
without a scratch?

18:39.016 --> 18:40.750
It was kind of
like a miracle.

18:40.818 --> 18:43.487
Well, then we should all bow
our heads and give thanks.

18:43.554 --> 18:44.854
It wasn't a miracle.

18:44.922 --> 18:48.558
It was like...
like magic.

18:48.626 --> 18:50.393
Like Sabrina
has some sort of
magical powers.

18:50.495 --> 18:54.097
Talk about overreacting to your
little brush with death, huh?

18:54.165 --> 18:57.668
So, you're not Sabrina's mother,
you're her aunt, huh?

18:57.736 --> 18:59.670
That's right.
Yeah, I know how
that can be.

18:59.738 --> 19:02.840
I'm Brad's stepfather,
but I raised him from a baby.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.174
Stepfather?

19:04.242 --> 19:06.343
You're not Brad's
biological father?

19:06.410 --> 19:07.911
That's wonderful.

19:07.979 --> 19:11.682
Hey, I am capable
of being a biological father.

19:11.749 --> 19:13.083
Oh, oh, of course.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.619
(whispering):
So he doesn't have the
witch-hunter gene...

19:15.687 --> 19:18.188
So we can use magic
to save Sabrina.

19:19.657 --> 19:21.024
I know what you are!

19:21.091 --> 19:23.393
Sabrina Spellman,
you are a...

19:24.963 --> 19:26.329
What's that light?

19:27.465 --> 19:28.398
HARVEY:
It's the moon.

19:28.466 --> 19:30.300
I guess the weather's
clearing up.

19:30.368 --> 19:32.936
What was I about to say?

19:33.004 --> 19:34.738
Look. Headlights!

19:34.806 --> 19:36.407
Somebody's here.
We're saved.

19:36.474 --> 19:39.309
It's your dad!
Sabrina's aunts!

19:39.377 --> 19:41.411
Wait, it's like
the moonlight wiped
out my memory.

19:41.479 --> 19:43.247
What was I about to say?
I can't remember.

19:43.314 --> 19:44.614
I know the feeling.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.817
Don't worry.
You'll get over it.

19:46.884 --> 19:47.951
I always do.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.085
Hey, over here.

19:49.153 --> 19:51.121
That was close.

19:51.189 --> 19:53.857
You know, you save a guy's life,
and he turns on you.

19:53.925 --> 19:55.826
Glad we screwed up his date.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.196
So you changed the weather,

19:59.264 --> 20:01.699
and that turned off
the witch-hunter gene?

20:01.766 --> 20:03.567
Yes, we used our <i>magic</i>
to save you.

20:03.635 --> 20:04.934
But we were able
to help

20:05.002 --> 20:07.704
because we took
the <i>precaution</i>
of coming up here.

20:07.772 --> 20:09.005
But we used our <i>magic.</i>

20:09.073 --> 20:10.707
But we prepared
for disaster.

20:10.775 --> 20:11.808
Can I say something?

20:11.876 --> 20:13.376
Thank you for rescuing me.

20:13.444 --> 20:15.178
Oh, you're welcome, sweetheart.

20:15.246 --> 20:18.649
We'd do anything for you,
Sabrina. You know that.

20:18.716 --> 20:20.384
May I say something?

20:20.452 --> 20:22.719
I want my Westerns.

20:26.491 --> 20:27.858
Oh, yes!

20:27.926 --> 20:29.927
TV ANNOUNCER:
That concludes our
Western marathon.

20:29.994 --> 20:33.396
(gasps)
Please stay tuned
for classic romance.

20:33.464 --> 20:34.697
(sobbing)

20:34.765 --> 20:37.234
First up, <i>The Other</i>
<i>Side of the Mountain.</i>

20:37.302 --> 20:39.870
Oh, Marilyn Hassett alert.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.141
I know you and Brad
don't get along too well,

20:45.209 --> 20:47.177
but you have to admit,
it was pretty cool of him

20:47.244 --> 20:48.912
to drive home with
his dad and your aunts

20:48.980 --> 20:50.246
and let us have his truck.

20:50.314 --> 20:52.415
And now we can have the romantic
weekend we were hoping for.

20:52.483 --> 20:54.350
With my mom and dad.

20:54.418 --> 20:55.819
Hey, it's better than not going.

20:55.887 --> 20:59.189
Now, if I could just find
the turnoff for the cabin

20:59.257 --> 21:00.557
on this dark road.

21:03.427 --> 21:05.695
Oh, hey, look.

21:05.763 --> 21:08.165
Brad has a satellite
navigation system.

21:08.232 --> 21:09.666
We take the next left.

21:09.734 --> 21:13.570
Wow. I cannot believe
he forgot he had that.

21:13.638 --> 21:16.206
Yeah, well, you know, Harvey,
I have to tell you the truth.

21:16.274 --> 21:17.875
Brad is weird.
