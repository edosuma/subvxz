NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues…

00:03.503 --> 00:05.213
RENKO: Oh, will you look at this?

00:05.296 --> 00:07.632
Shirret, you can't keep leaving
your kids alone.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.927
Now if you want me to arrest your butt
for child abandonment, I will.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.763
She's with me, Chuck.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.056
-(bang)
-(glass shatters)

00:15.140 --> 00:18.977
All right! That's it! I want everybody
to put your hands on the bar right now.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.396
-Put your hands on the bar.
-Drinking a lot these days.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.566
Hey, don't get righteous with me, Neal.
We closed too many bars together.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.735
You never seen me drinking
on the job, man. Never.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.987
-What are you, my mother?
-Closer than that, man.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.155
I'm your partner.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.615
Back out the door
before one of us gets reckless.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.326
-Drop it!
-(woman screams)

00:35.410 --> 00:38.288
-(tires screech)
-(horn honks)

00:38.371 --> 00:41.207
He had a shotgun!
He coulda killed those people on the bus!

00:41.291 --> 00:42.876
Hey, easy, Mick. Easy, easy.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.545
I won't have no drunk covering my back.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.756
I spent the entire night with a woman.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.424
You, too?

00:49.507 --> 00:54.387
To make a long story short,
her key broke off in the lock.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.056
-Mm-hmm.
-And I was in my uniform,

00:56.139 --> 00:58.808
so I blew her lock off with my .357.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.226
I'm no cop, Frank.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.187
Masquerade's gone on long enough.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.523
So, I wanna take my wife and my babies
and get the hell out of here.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.276
We're talking about a charge
of child endangerment here.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.652
That's pretty heavy stuff.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.405
Why don't you give the lady a chance?

01:12.489 --> 01:15.200
I think that she can turn
this whole thing around.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.035
You so sure of that?

01:17.118 --> 01:18.995
Sure enough to bet a dinner on it.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.622
Why is it that you come on to everyone

01:20.705 --> 01:23.249
like you just spent the afternoon
shoveling horse manure?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.459
Evening, ma'am.

01:25.001 --> 01:29.214
-Freeze!
-(gunshots)

01:29.297 --> 01:32.634
RAY: Dead before he hit the ground, Frank.
Through the heart.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.261
I heard the victim fired a couple
of shots. Where's the gun?

01:35.345 --> 01:36.846
No gun, Frank.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.517
All units in the Dekker Avenue,
Von Steuben area--

01:40.600 --> 01:43.186
(crowd clamoring angrily)

01:43.269 --> 01:45.605
MAN (over radio):
<i>Captain Furillo, respond please.</i>

01:46.147 --> 01:48.691
<i>Respond, please, Captain Furillo.</i>

01:48.775 --> 01:53.071
(crowd chanting angrily)

01:53.154 --> 01:56.324
For those of you who haven't heard,
there was a riot around 4:00 this morning

01:56.407 --> 01:59.410
in the 900 block of East Utica
following an officer-involved shooting

01:59.494 --> 02:03.123
of a young male, black,
suspected of robbery.

02:03.206 --> 02:07.836
Thus far, we're looking at 28 arrests,

02:07.919 --> 02:11.422
14 hospitalizations,
five of those from the night shift.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.342
So, let's be mindful of the kind of mood
out there today

02:14.425 --> 02:16.678
and try to maintain a diplomatic profile.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.847
Give people the benefit of the doubt.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.849
I'd rather you let slide
a few misdemeanors

02:20.932 --> 02:23.143
than have a repeat
of what went down last night.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.437
Next item is Item 10.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.985
Concerns our rather anemic showing
at the Mercy Hospital Blood Bank.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.195
(discontented muttering, groaning)

02:34.279 --> 02:36.990
So, with regard
to your obviously busy schedules,

02:37.073 --> 02:40.326
the sisters will be relocating
the aforementioned blood bank

02:40.410 --> 02:42.579
to this very room
for the remainder of the week.

02:42.662 --> 02:47.959
(discontented muttering intensifies)

02:48.042 --> 02:49.669
All right. The last item.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.379
(laughing)

02:52.755 --> 02:56.134
In view of the current warm snap,
I can fully sympathize

02:56.217 --> 02:58.011
with your various and whimsical attempts

02:58.094 --> 02:59.804
at self-expression through fashion.

02:59.888 --> 03:04.225
But insomuch as this is a precinct house
and not a boutique,

03:04.893 --> 03:07.312
and per Divisional policy,

03:07.395 --> 03:10.607
all uniform officers
will conform to the dress code.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.735
Dress code, I might add,
does not include huaraches,

03:13.818 --> 03:18.072
clogs, Western, motocross boots

03:18.156 --> 03:21.659
or any sort of hat, scarf

03:21.743 --> 03:25.371
or T-shirts advocating sex, drugs

03:26.206 --> 03:29.125
or regions of the human anatomy
hanging loose.

03:29.876 --> 03:34.214
All right. That's it. Let's roll.
And hey, let's be careful out there.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.758
Hold it right there!

03:39.427 --> 03:41.554
We need additional units
down on East Utica

03:41.638 --> 03:42.889
to relieve the night shift.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.808
WOMAN: Okay, I don't wanna do that.

03:45.892 --> 03:49.020
-Hill, Renko, Cooper--
-WOMAN: Say Perez.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.649
-Perez, O'Keefe, DiCarlo--
-MAN: Come on, O'Keefe. Let's go.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.319
Banahowski, Coley, Lyle, Topez.

03:56.402 --> 04:00.240
On the double! Hey, be particularly alert!

04:00.323 --> 04:02.867
That sniper might still
be working the rooftops.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.620
-MAN 1: Take care.
-MAN 2: Come on, partner.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.872
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:07.956 --> 04:10.083
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:10.166 --> 04:13.753
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:25.265
(theme music playing)

05:22.905 --> 05:24.615
I'm telling you. It's no big deal, okay?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.159
I slipped in the tub last night.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.494
(chuckling):
I ran into Militello this morning.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.331
Claims he saw some joker go down
for the count at Cole's last night

05:31.414 --> 05:33.291
after eight rounds with a bottle of 151.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.084
Hey, Listen, man. I was stone-cold sober

05:35.168 --> 05:36.919
when a John Doe popped me
in the chin, okay?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.005
-What are you--
-LaRue, Washington,

05:39.088 --> 05:40.923
I need you to transport Detective Weeks

05:41.007 --> 05:43.051
-back to the scene of the shooting.
-(shouting)

05:43.134 --> 05:45.428
I thought things
were still a little hairy down there.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.180
It's a picnic compared to last night.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.265
That's the last
of the arrests coming in now.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.308
Okay.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.769
Hey, Charlie, let's do it.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.354
They want you back at the alley.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.692
Sometime today be okay, Charlie?

06:06.657 --> 06:07.784
Right.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.289
MAN: No, ma'am.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.293
(siren wailing, police radio chatter)

06:19.629 --> 06:20.797
Some circus.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.716
Those S.I.D. guys have taken
enough pictures for a yearbook.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.095
Three dozen yoms ready
to burn the block down,

06:27.178 --> 06:28.513
and two Internal Affairs boys

06:28.596 --> 06:30.598
ready to throw Weeks to the dogs.

06:31.766 --> 06:36.938
Fuchs, a kid got killed here
last night-- 17 years old.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.773
Five cops hospitalized.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.024
So, come off it, okay?

06:41.275 --> 06:42.735
That black dude, Shaw?

06:43.778 --> 06:45.613
A real ladder climber, that one.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.872
You're awful quiet this morning, Henry.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.419
As far as I'm concerned,
they oughta save the city the trouble

06:59.502 --> 07:00.837
and put Weeks away for good.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.880
I see you've already made up your mind.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.715
What do you think, Frank?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.052
It's the fourth time
he's been in a spot like this,

07:08.136 --> 07:10.888
not to mention the half dozen
complaints in his file

07:10.972 --> 07:12.598
for excessive force.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.936
The man's trigger-happy,
especially when the target is black.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.023
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm a little sick
of carrying the same badge

07:21.107 --> 07:23.443
as guys who are only in it for the rush.

07:24.944 --> 07:29.157
Frank, could I acknowledge
your input on something?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.659
-Acknowledge his input.
-If you wanna bring choppers in

07:31.742 --> 07:33.870
for that sniper search, Howard,
the answer's no.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.788
Oh, the alleged sniper
is long gone, Frank,

07:35.872 --> 07:37.874
if there ever was one to begin with.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.333
Uh, a question.

07:42.128 --> 07:46.757
Do I, uh, as a general rule, tend to, uh,

07:48.342 --> 07:50.803
invade people's space?

07:53.931 --> 07:57.143
Well, it was just an aside
that Lorraine made last night.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.186
Lorraine?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.189
(sighs)

08:01.689 --> 08:03.733
I'm seeing a woman, Frank.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.028
-How about that.
-Yeah.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.114
Well, at any rate, we were coming out of…

08:10.198 --> 08:12.825
my first SUM seminar last night--

08:12.909 --> 08:15.703
-You're going to SUM?
-What on earth is SUM?

08:16.370 --> 08:20.541
Well, it's an acronym for,
uh, Scheinkopf Utilitarian Mode,

08:20.625 --> 08:24.921
as in "cognito," ergo sum.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.923
It's human dynamics, Frank.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.842
It's sort of like EST
without the toilet training.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.095
Not bad, Henry.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.806
That's a pretty good one-liner.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.226
Lorraine'll get a real kick outta that.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.769
(glass shattering)

08:40.686 --> 08:42.647
"EST without the toilet training."

08:42.730 --> 08:45.983
(people shouting)

08:46.067 --> 08:48.903
-Howard!
-(glass shattering continues)

08:48.986 --> 08:53.241
Oh. O'Keefe, let's render
that rooftop nonoperational.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.122
(siren wailing, horn honking)

09:09.674 --> 09:12.593
MAN (over speaker): <i>Will the members</i>
<i>of the press please move back?</i>

09:15.179 --> 09:16.389
(tires screech)

09:20.685 --> 09:23.396
Officer Weeks, uh,
Lieutenants John Hurley and…

09:23.479 --> 09:24.689
BOTH: Clayton Shaw.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.400
Internal Affairs.
They'll be handling your case.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.902
You all know Captain Fuchs, Narcotics.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.488
Could we please make this fast,
so I can get my men out of here

09:32.572 --> 09:34.574
before the rest
of the neighborhood wakes up?

09:34.657 --> 09:37.326
According to your report
to Captain Furillo here,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.203
you were passing
by the front of this alley

09:39.287 --> 09:41.664
about 3:15 this morning, off duty?

09:41.747 --> 09:44.625
-Right.
-When you saw three black men

09:44.709 --> 09:46.961
emerge from the rear door
of this clothing store?

09:47.044 --> 09:48.629
That's right. (exhales)

09:49.797 --> 09:53.009
With the Trans Am parked outside,
I thought they were taking the place down.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.554
So, I drew my service revolver-- S&amp;W .38--

09:57.096 --> 10:00.975
I.D.'d myself and instructed them
not to make any further movements.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.646
-Captain!
-Uh, LaRue.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.650
Why don't you just give it
to us verbatim, Weeks?

10:09.734 --> 10:12.612
Verbatim? Well, Lieutenant, as I recall,

10:12.695 --> 10:15.114
I said, "Freeze, niggers,
or I'll blow your heads off."

10:15.197 --> 10:16.490
You wanna know what came down,

10:16.574 --> 10:18.993
you find the Trans Am
with the bullet in the back of it.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.579
-(glass shatters)
-RENKO: Hey!

10:21.662 --> 10:23.122
You come on down here, you coward!

10:23.205 --> 10:25.833
You fool! I can't stand this!
Get these people out of here!

10:25.916 --> 10:28.169
Get me out of here!
Will you please do me a favor?

10:28.252 --> 10:30.921
Look, I don't have to stand
around here and take this…

10:31.005 --> 10:33.299
I thought the captain would want
to talk to Mr. Monroe.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.635
-I found him going in the front side.
-Thanks, babe.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.802
We'll take it from here.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.767
What's happening, brother? You're open
kind of early in the morning, ain't ya?

10:42.850 --> 10:45.019
Early is prime time
for the carriage trade.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.396
The Eldorado set, brother.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.899
A diamond in the back,
as in your basic pimp type.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.235
You're kidding. You're telling me they
buy suits this time of the morning?

10:53.319 --> 10:54.862
In multiples, my man.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.615
Sometimes more
when their nose is doing the talking.

10:57.698 --> 11:01.118
They sleep all day, so you gotta catch 'em
when they come off that playing field,

11:01.202 --> 11:02.912
all rich and happy from the night before.

11:02.995 --> 11:03.913
(laughs)

11:03.996 --> 11:05.581
I got a few questions for you, blood.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.958
Yeah. What's all the commotion about?

11:08.042 --> 11:10.878
-Somebody buy it last night?
-You got that right.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.715
MAN: Satisfy something for me, Weeks.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.678
What were you doing down here
at 3:00 in the morning, off duty?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.849
Do you have people in the area,
or were you just out looking for action?

11:23.933 --> 11:24.975
Come on. What is this?

11:25.059 --> 11:27.728
Is there some law against him
being on the street on his own time?

11:28.396 --> 11:31.399
Well, as of this moment, he has
nothing more to back up his story

11:32.108 --> 11:33.359
but one dead kid.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.029
No car, no gun, no accomplice.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.157
No other slugs except the ones he fired.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.283
What'd that guy say?

11:41.951 --> 11:43.661
He's the manager of the clothing store.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.371
But he didn't know about any break-in.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.207
He's lying. They came outta that door.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.419
Neither the front or the back door
shows any signs of forced entry.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.296
And the guy's positive
there's no cash or merchandise missing.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.928
Looks like your luck just ran out, Weeks.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.268
(theme music playing)

12:12.440 --> 12:15.109
Don't tell me you've never seen
a pint of blood before, Michael.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.405
Are you kidding, ma'am? In my line of work
I see gallons of the stuff.

12:20.322 --> 12:24.577
Except it's usually on sidewalks
and bumpers, woodwork and things.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.203
So, what else is new?

12:26.912 --> 12:30.082
Hey, Mick, think you can get loose later
for a few hands of klabiash?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.001
Oh, I can't today, Leo.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.463
I'm on a special assignment
with the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.048
They've been renting out
this storefront over on Kosciusko

12:38.132 --> 12:40.676
for over a month now
that receives stolen property.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.053
-A fake fencing operation?
-Yeah.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.891
We bust the dopers, trace the money
to the dealers. It's terrific.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.643
Now, that didn't hurt too badly,
did it, Michael?

12:49.727 --> 12:51.937
No, ma'am, it didn't.
Actually, it was kind of fun.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.189
-Good.
-Remember, ma'am,

12:53.272 --> 12:55.274
there's plenty more where that came from.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.403
No, no, Michael.
Now we rest for 15 minutes.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.363
-(groaning)
-That's good.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.784
Hey, Mick, Blotski's looking
kind of squeamish over there.

13:04.867 --> 13:09.330
BELKER (laughing): Blotski. Come on, Leo.

13:09.413 --> 13:13.125
Any guy that'd jump through
a plate glass window on a five-buck bet

13:13.209 --> 13:15.294
ain't gonna be squeamish about anything.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.422
(thuds)

13:18.506 --> 13:20.508
WOMAN: Can I have an inhaler?

13:20.591 --> 13:21.884
I stand corrected.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.678
(chuckles)

13:24.762 --> 13:27.264
-(phone ringing)
-Hello? Calletano speaking.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.393
Francis, I got over a dozen calls for you.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.479
Citizens Review Board,
Midtown Urban League,

13:33.562 --> 13:34.522
two from <i>The Courier.</i>

13:34.605 --> 13:36.482
-Thanks, but they'll have to wait.
-Henry.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.442
(phone ringing)

13:38.526 --> 13:40.736
-The hospital.
-Thanks.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.446
Goldblume.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.410
No, I was calling about my son,
Josh Goldblume.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.707
Now, look, you promised
you'd give me the results

13:53.791 --> 13:55.793
of the blood tests no later than 10:30.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.921
O-- Okay.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.091
Listen. Will you please have the doctor
call me just as soon as he comes in?

14:02.174 --> 14:04.385
Please? Thank you.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.396
Like I told the headhunter, I was down
there looking for a snitch of mine.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.106
Oh. This snitch have a name?

14:17.606 --> 14:21.110
(sighs): Take your pick.
The little scum's got half a dozen names.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.236
Give me one.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.074
David Kazmarek. K-A-Z-M-A-R-E-K.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.244
What are the chances
of finding the snitch?

14:31.829 --> 14:34.206
Seems to me you oughta be askin'
what that kid was doing

14:34.290 --> 14:37.459
-behind that store at 3:00 in the morning.
-We'll cover that base, Weeks.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.712
If this snitch has a record,

14:39.795 --> 14:41.463
I suggest you pull it.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.550
I'd like to hear directly from him
you had a meet scheduled.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.719
It ain't that way, Furillo.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.805
I was up there trying to track him down.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.849
The sleaze burned me for 20 bucks.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.685
Understand
what I'm trying to do here, Weeks.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.897
I'm trying to make your side
of this a little more credible.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.524
So, why don't you just go out there
and try to pull his record?

15:09.742 --> 15:13.037
Put out an A.P.B. on David Kazmarek.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.121
Right, Captain.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.583
You stay, J.D.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.131
What's with the chin? Hmm?

15:24.214 --> 15:26.467
Oh, nicked myself shaving
this morning, Captain.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.595
I got an $85 electric razor

15:29.678 --> 15:32.056
that's got about as much finesse
as a Veg-O-Matic.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.267
I got a call yesterday
from the finance company

15:35.351 --> 15:37.019
carrying the loan on your car.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.063
Those parasites!

15:39.146 --> 15:40.648
(exhales forcefully)

15:41.273 --> 15:44.234
I'm sorry, Captain. You shouldn't
have been bothered with that.

15:44.318 --> 15:48.906
They claim you pulled a gun on one
of their repo men yesterday morning.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.533
How was I supposed to know
he was a company man?

15:51.617 --> 15:54.370
This stewardess that I've been…
This lady friend of mine,

15:54.453 --> 15:56.246
she gives me a shake
at 5:00 in the morning

15:56.330 --> 15:59.333
and says there's some fat Puerto Rican
outside jimmying my door lock.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.961
They claim you made him
assume the position

16:02.044 --> 16:04.421
on the sidewalk for over five minutes.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.507
I had to I.D. the guy, didn't I?

16:06.590 --> 16:08.801
And besides, it was two minutes
at the most, Captain.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.177
I swear to God.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.391
To tell you the truth,
I was a little bit upset.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.477
Here they come, trying to rip my wheels
off because of one lousy payment!

16:18.560 --> 16:20.354
Six payments, J.D.,

16:20.437 --> 16:23.107
according to the loan manager.
Twelve hundred bucks.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.652
He says he'll give you
till the end of the week

16:26.735 --> 16:29.279
to either come up with the money
or turn back the car.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.368
J.D., half the men in that squad room

16:34.451 --> 16:36.829
raise families on less than you take home.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.126
-I just don't know where it all goes.
-Oh, sure you do.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.795
Don't play that game with me.
You think I haven't noticed

16:44.878 --> 16:47.256
how you've been dragging your butt
around here lately?

16:47.339 --> 16:51.468
It used to be only Monday mornings,
but it's turned into a regular routine.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.636
(door opens)

16:52.720 --> 16:56.223
Excuse me, Francis.
Internal Affairs on four.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.975
Thanks, Phil. In a minute.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.145
(door closes)

17:01.228 --> 17:05.899
Your badge does not punch out
with your time card, LaRue.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.153
I don't care if they were trying
to repossess your front lawn.

17:09.236 --> 17:12.322
I won't have my men
abusing their authority.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.324
Okay.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.912
And I'm sorry about the hassle
with the loan company.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.831
I'll have it taken care of.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.833
Things can come apart on you awfully fast

17:22.916 --> 17:25.127
in this line of work,
J.D., if you let 'em.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.592
(door closes)

17:37.222 --> 17:40.476
RENKO: You know, I'm ashamed
to tell Sandra how I spend my days.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.270
Stand around in alleys,
walking around the streets

17:43.353 --> 17:45.189
trying to control a bunch of crazy people,

17:45.272 --> 17:47.274
half of which are named
after past presidents.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.527
Johnson, Jackson, Cleveland, Roosevelt.

17:50.611 --> 17:54.740
Suspect is one Jackson Washington,
211 Grant Street.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.327
You know, we oughta move out to California
and be motorcycle cops.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.661
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's right.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.872
They don't have ghettos in California,
do they?

18:01.955 --> 18:04.583
Well, it's not all ghetto like it is here.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.585
They're all real mellow
out there, you know?

18:06.668 --> 18:09.379
They, uh… They never argue about anything,

18:09.463 --> 18:12.966
except maybe the best price for coke
or how to spell "quich" Lorraine.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.593
-It's "quiche" Lorraine.
-What?

18:14.676 --> 18:15.844
-Quiche, quiche.
-Quiche.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.639
DISPATCHER (over radio):
<i>South Lennox. Domestic disturbance.</i>

18:18.722 --> 18:21.058
<i>920 Ferry Avenue.</i>

18:21.141 --> 18:23.685
<i>-See the building manager.</i>
-Well, so much for California.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.356
-You the one that called in?
-Yeah. Up here. This way.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.275
I want a piece of this guy.
Nothing I hate worse than a wife beater.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.527
This way.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.862
-They've been screamin' something awful.
-Look out.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.532
-Been going on all morning.
-Is he armed?

18:36.615 --> 18:37.658
Afraid not, Officer.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.536
I don't know how many times
I've told him to get a shotgun.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.580
-Okay, open up! Police!
-He's been asking for it.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.624
Running around till all hours
of the morning,

18:45.707 --> 18:47.292
spending her hard-earned paycheck.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.045
Wait a second. You're telling me
that she's beating on him?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.173
-Mm-hmm.
-Louella goes a good 250 pounds.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.970
-A little shuttle diplomacy here for ya.
-Thanks a lot, but no thanks.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.806
-Open up or I'll break the door down!
-What's going on, Joe?

19:00.889 --> 19:03.392
-Some lady's beating on her husband.
-You're kidding.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.727
You wouldn't think so
if you'd seen the lady.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.397
I mean, we're talking big, Jack.
Linebacker big.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.275
-And mean. Whoo-whee!
-Louella is not mean.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.442
It's the heat, Officer.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.987
With all that weight
she's carrying around…

19:15.070 --> 19:18.615
-(crashing)
-Joe, just kick the door in, will ya?

19:18.699 --> 19:21.660
For cryin' out loud, the guy sounds
like he's getting killed in there.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.247
-(shouting, pounding)
-(chattering)

19:25.330 --> 19:26.582
(bang)

19:28.917 --> 19:31.128
Okay. All right. Okay--
All right, Louella.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.589
Don't let her size fool ya.
She's quick on her feet.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.132
-(people gasping)
-Ooh-whee!

19:35.215 --> 19:38.135
Okay, Louella, what do you say
we just put the board down--

19:38.218 --> 19:40.470
(yelling)

19:40.554 --> 19:42.389
-She wants to hit us.
-RENKO: No.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.766
Now, Louella, you're gonna
have to come on in with us.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.852
A-All right.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.937
These people, I swear!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.230
Now, look here, lady.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.066
-Now, I'm bigger than you are.
-No, you're not.

19:53.483 --> 19:56.862
All right, Louella. Enough's enough.
We're gonna take you in.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.990
-(whimpering)
-Lucy, slap the cuffs on her.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.993
We'll just wait outside, darlin'.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.250
Back up.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.841
Are you sure this thing
can handle hard-core vegetables?

20:17.925 --> 20:19.593
-I mean, like beets and things.
-Yeah.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.511
Beets and hard carrots
and stuff like that.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.471
Yeah.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.848
I don't want you pushing
lightweight materials on me.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.974
Are you kidding?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.560
-This is a $50 machine here.
-Give me that.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.145
Two hundred and fifty watts.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.064
It'll juice anything
this side of a Harley.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.399
(laughs)

20:39.988 --> 20:41.031
(knocking)

20:47.371 --> 20:49.915
This stuff will either
fill you up or kill you guys.

20:50.707 --> 20:54.294
-How we doing, Belker?
-(laughing) I love it.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.967
A three-bag-a-day junkie
peddling hot vegetable juicers.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.052
This is better than <i>The Gong Show.</i>

21:03.053 --> 21:05.389
I gotta get a copy of this tape
for my brother-in-law.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.849
-You missed the guy with the hot minks.
-Mink coats?

21:07.933 --> 21:10.686
No, minks.
Two live minks, allegedly pregnant.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.063
Hey, you'd be able to breed
the old lady a new coat.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.190
Belker, grab your lunch
and take over out there.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.275
Right.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.735
And this time, don't bargain
the trade into the ground.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.070
We're gathering evidence.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.616
Just trying to save the government
a little money, dog breath.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.952
Look, you zinged the last deal.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.706
-Don't do it again.
-(low growl)

21:34.584 --> 21:38.005
(muffled shouting)

21:38.088 --> 21:39.464
MAN: What are you doing?

21:39.548 --> 21:42.509
-Easy, easy, Louella.
-(grunting)

21:42.592 --> 21:45.304
She's all yours, Leo.
Lock her up. I dare ya.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.056
Come on. I already gave a pint
of blood today, Luce.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.684
-Leo, cute.
-Be nice.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.686
Right this way, Louella.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.022
All right. I'll get him for you.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.734
Henry. Henry, it's the hospital.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.864
Detective Goldblume.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.326
Yeah.

22:08.243 --> 22:12.205
Francis, Henry's on the phone
talking to the hospital.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.458
(whispering): Oh, his son.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.752
He was supposed to receive
the report this morning.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.212
-Yeah?
-Yes, I'll be there in 20 minutes.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.922
(whispering): I hope he's all right.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.178
Now they think it could be meningitis.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.304
I gotta go.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.973
Oh, geez.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.810
I hope they're not gonna
keep Weeks here all day.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.815
Gnarly dude, that Weeks.
Gets on people's nerves.

22:38.899 --> 22:42.235
Is there any special reason why you keep
tapping away like that, J.D.?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.739
-Hmm?
-Oh, no. I'm sorry, Neal.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.491
I've got a few things on my mind.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.789
Listen. I got some unfinished business.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.041
You think you could live without me
for an hour or so?

22:56.124 --> 22:57.793
-I'll certainly try my best.
-Okay.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.469
Excuse me.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.937
I missed you last night.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.732
I phoned. You weren't in.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.610
I was in. I wasn't answering the phone.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.904
I thought you might still be mad at me.

23:26.863 --> 23:27.906
What for?

23:29.032 --> 23:31.326
For what I did to you in there yesterday.

23:32.452 --> 23:35.038
But I really didn't want you
anywhere near that guy.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.125
You made that pretty clear.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.378
Here.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.630
Phillies are in town.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.175
My apologies to Officers Perez and Cooper.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.678
I shouldn't have jumped on them.
I'm sorry.

23:49.761 --> 23:53.473
Good seats. Is this a bribe, Counselor?

23:54.307 --> 23:55.684
Yes.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.729
You know, you drink
too much of that stuff.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.314
It makes you high-strung.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.153
Speaking of which, I could've used
you last night, Furillo.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.113
All you had to do was answer your phone.

24:11.658 --> 24:12.993
Right.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.954
(romantic music playing)

25:03.960 --> 25:05.587
(sighs)

25:05.670 --> 25:08.215
Well, I see our allotted time is over.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.966
Oh, come on.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.220
You know I'm up to my neck
in this Weeks investigation.

25:15.805 --> 25:20.769
I thought we could, uh,
go to the Palm Garden for lunch.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.981
What's with you, kiddo?

25:25.065 --> 25:26.483
(laughs)

25:27.734 --> 25:30.445
I really think I like you today, Furillo.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.573
You still like me?

25:34.282 --> 25:35.909
What's wrong? Didn't I show it?

25:36.409 --> 25:37.494
Yeah.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.914
Why else would I offer to buy you lunch?

25:40.997 --> 25:42.999
We've got to keep your strength up.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.882
You still haven't told me
what you're doing about your rape case.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.217
Are you defending him or what?

25:53.969 --> 25:56.805
He's been reassigned to Pam Gilliam.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.473
-You know her?
-No.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.516
She's good.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.310
Fourth in her graduating class.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.688
Good family, good contacts.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.856
In the trenches 18 hours a day.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.235
-Remind you of anyone?
-(chuckles)

26:12.571 --> 26:15.448
-Frank, I've been thinking.
-Mmm?

26:16.283 --> 26:18.743
Maybe I've been working
in this junkyard too long.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.038
It's making me mean and angry…

26:23.665 --> 26:26.501
and too ready to fight
with everyone about anything.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.378
Why don't you take some time off?

26:29.963 --> 26:31.840
That's the general idea.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.760
I wanna take you someplace with…

26:36.803 --> 26:39.806
beaches, palm trees, rolling surf.

26:40.473 --> 26:42.225
Take some time to get to know each other.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.396
Who knows? I may discover you're boring.

26:46.479 --> 26:49.399
Uh-oh. I'm not sure
I wanna take that chance.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.694
It's important.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.448
(romantic music playing)

26:58.783 --> 27:00.076
Okay. It's a deal.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.249
(suspenseful music playing)

27:09.044 --> 27:11.046
(coughs)

27:14.299 --> 27:15.383
(exhales)

27:45.872 --> 27:47.749
(water running)

27:47.832 --> 27:49.626
Got something on your mind, Washington?

27:49.709 --> 27:53.213
Yeah. You. I've gotta hand it to you, man.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.507
You got to be about the coolest
mother I've ever met,

27:55.590 --> 27:57.509
or you just don't give a damn, that it?

27:58.343 --> 28:00.303
What's the matter?
You don't like my attitude?

28:01.137 --> 28:03.723
Are you working advance man
for the Urban League or what?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.101
What do you want?

28:07.060 --> 28:08.269
You want a piece of me?

28:09.396 --> 28:11.022
You're gonna have to take a number.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.983
Every suntan in this department
wants a piece of me,

28:14.567 --> 28:17.445
especially the houseboy they sent down
from Internal Affairs.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.031
You wanna go for it?

28:21.157 --> 28:21.991
Come on.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.786
I don't understand
what you're doing, Weeks.

28:25.203 --> 28:28.748
If you think you're being railroaded,
you can file a claim of prejudice.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.334
But keep on doing what you're doing,

28:31.418 --> 28:33.545
man, you're not only
getting yourself axed,

28:33.628 --> 28:36.214
but you're on your way
to an arraignment for manslaughter.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.426
-No way.
-Is that right?

28:39.509 --> 28:42.387
Well, let me wake you
up to something, sucker.

28:42.846 --> 28:46.141
This was number four.
Three black, one brown.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.351
And that jive story
you laid on Internal Affairs

28:48.435 --> 28:51.062
about being out at 3:00 in the morning
looking for your snitch?

28:51.146 --> 28:53.148
That's lame, man! That stinks!

28:53.231 --> 28:55.150
Who in the hell you think
you're dealing with?

28:55.233 --> 28:56.818
Boy Scouts? Virgins?

28:56.901 --> 28:59.529
Those are headhunters, man. Pros.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.824
And at the rate you're going,
they are going to feed you your face, man.

29:02.907 --> 29:06.286
What I love is all this holiness
all of a sudden comin' off the Hill.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.747
You wanna talk about your partner LaRue?

29:09.956 --> 29:12.333
What were you doing down
in that alley, Weeks? Huh?

29:13.918 --> 29:15.503
You out shakin' somebody down?

29:16.463 --> 29:19.174
Maybe copping a freebie from a hooker.
That it? Huh?

29:23.094 --> 29:27.891
I've been in Narcotics 13 years, since the
day they recruited me out of the academy.

29:27.974 --> 29:30.059
Thirteen years at the bottom
of the crap heap.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.688
No promotion to sergeant, no gold shields,

29:34.773 --> 29:35.982
no transfers,

29:36.733 --> 29:37.942
because we're marked.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.736
We're flakes.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.155
What were you doin' down there, Weeks?

29:42.238 --> 29:46.367
This department's cost me
my wife, my kids, my friends.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.329
I was born in this town.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.956
I've lived my whole life here.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.300
It was a clean shoot.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.262
They shot at me, and I shot back.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.432
(water running)

30:25.323 --> 30:28.034
He says he was down there
because for the past eight months or so,

30:28.117 --> 30:30.119
he's had a line
on a heavyweight coke importer

30:30.203 --> 30:32.497
by the name of George Pinky Reiner.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.124
But that hairdressers--
Touché Beauty Salon--

30:35.208 --> 30:38.127
they supposedly cut the coke for Reiner
and distribute it to Midtown.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.797
-What do you think?
-Well, it washes better than that jive

30:40.880 --> 30:42.757
about him hanging out
looking for a snitch.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.426
Then why in the hell didn't he tell us
that in the first place?

30:45.510 --> 30:48.096
Mm. Something that big,
he figured if he went by the book,

30:48.179 --> 30:50.348
they'd kick it upstairs
to a captain or lieutenant.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.851
It was supposed to be
his passport out of Narco.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.644
-Ray?
-Yes, Frank?

30:55.645 --> 31:00.817
Let's do an R &amp; I on one George
Pinky Reiner, suspected coke dealer.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.111
-See if he's in the computer.
-Right, Frank.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.863
Whether he's listed or not, Captain,

31:05.446 --> 31:08.032
I wouldn't mind staking out
that hairdressers.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.368
My guess is that coroner's inquest
day after tomorrow

31:10.451 --> 31:12.453
is gonna recommend prosecution to the D.A.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.122
So, what's to lose?

31:14.205 --> 31:16.749
Why are you so hot to do this, Neal?

31:16.833 --> 31:18.418
Everybody knows about Weeks.

31:18.501 --> 31:21.462
He's a knee-buster and a bigot.
The only reason he's lasted this long

31:21.546 --> 31:24.007
is none of the two dozen charges
against him has ever stuck.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.676
I've never taken down
a coke importer, Captain.

31:26.759 --> 31:29.304
-Maybe there's a promotion in it.
-That sounds good, Neal.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.805
Now, what's the real reason?

31:31.556 --> 31:35.143
Well, as much of a honky
as he is, Captain,

31:35.935 --> 31:37.395
I've got a feeling about it.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.023
I think it could have been
a righteous shoot.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.816
Okay.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.694
Find LaRue and start laying it out.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.695
Right.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.997
You gotta listen
to what this guy's saying.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.880
(laughing)

32:04.464 --> 32:07.175
I don't know. You tell me.
What do you think this junk is worth?

32:07.258 --> 32:09.218
I paid a thousand.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.638
I'd take 800.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.264
(laughing): I bet you will.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.476
What happened?
Did you get tired of being a dentist?

32:16.559 --> 32:20.229
Right. Only mouth I catch
my fingers in is my own.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.774
(laughing):
I wouldn't completely bet on that.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.067
Say what?

32:24.150 --> 32:25.610
I said I'm gonna give you 50 bucks.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.695
Man, you're trying to rip me off?

32:27.779 --> 32:30.782
Look, pal, you know how many dentists
I get who are going out of business?

32:30.865 --> 32:33.868
Come on.
This kind of medical junk don't move.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.954
You know what moves? Gold.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.790
Seems to me

32:39.290 --> 32:43.086
I did take some gold
outta this dude's upper plate.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.088
How much gold?

32:46.339 --> 32:48.049
Four ounces.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.926
(chuckles)

32:50.009 --> 32:52.136
You bring that in. That I can move.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.890
(sighs)

33:00.979 --> 33:04.649
You catalog that 517-MB-1135.

33:04.732 --> 33:07.068
517-MB-35.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.778
Why didn't you try for that guy's name?

33:09.862 --> 33:11.656
Patience, hair ball.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.616
I got 10-to-1 says that piece of cheese

33:13.700 --> 33:15.994
took down that dental clinic
over on North Pulaski,

33:16.077 --> 33:18.287
and I'm gonna bust him
and his running mates.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.874
You should've pumped him for drugs.
That's what we're here for.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.261
I'll be back in a couple minutes.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.597
-I've seen better.
-Come on. Take a good look.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.725
What do you think this is? Zircons?

33:38.808 --> 33:41.602
These are genuine diamonds,
and the setting's 18 karat.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.274
Come on, man.
Any other jewelry store in this town

33:46.357 --> 33:48.109
would give me 2,500, no questions.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.694
Yeah? Who, for instance?

33:49.777 --> 33:51.696
Come up a little and we got a deal.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.322
I'm overstocked now.

33:53.948 --> 33:56.826
Look, why don't you bring me something
I can move a little faster?

34:00.163 --> 34:02.540
Pop for 1,900.
I'll see what I can't put together.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.710
I swear to God, man.
I got some righteous connections.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.922
Okay, you got yourself a deal.
But put it together fast.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.758
I got customers waiting on it.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.645
(jazz music playing)

34:32.195 --> 34:33.279
Excuse me.

34:35.865 --> 34:39.744
-No, don't!
-(sighs) Oh!

34:39.827 --> 34:42.246
What the hell are you doing here, huh?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.623
(groans)

34:43.706 --> 34:47.001
-Oh, man.
-Where's your brains, J.D.?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.003
-What--
-That is not a fence in there.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.255
That is a front, a scam.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.469
They got you on videotape, J.D.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.930
They got your voice, they got your prints,

34:59.013 --> 35:01.766
and the money they gave you
is marked, ya crud-for-brains.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.142
Oh, man.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.019
Is it hot?

35:06.270 --> 35:07.730
Is that jewelry hot?

35:08.189 --> 35:10.483
No. It belongs to this chick.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.985
Don't lie to me,
not unless you want broken kidneys.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.403
I'm being straight.

35:15.154 --> 35:17.406
It's a payback. The chick owes me.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.455
Better have the lady come in.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.582
The both of you got
to explain it to the captain.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.543
And do not try to move that money.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.005
Uh, that's gonna be a little hard to do.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.467
The lady's being difficult.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.761
Total vacancy between the ears.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.304
You know what I mean?

35:41.639 --> 35:42.598
Mick,

35:44.392 --> 35:47.145
what's the chances on something
happening to the videotape?

35:47.228 --> 35:49.355
Did you just tell me this was straight?

35:49.438 --> 35:52.441
Hey, it is. It is!

35:52.525 --> 35:55.903
It-- It'd be a lot easier with your help.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.697
Be a lot easier with my help?

35:58.948 --> 36:00.783
I've covered for your screwups before.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.869
We all have. Not this time.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.412
Not a chance.

36:05.079 --> 36:06.914
And get yourself some mouthwash!

36:06.998 --> 36:08.958
You smell like the inside
of a pint bottle.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.084
Hey!

36:19.385 --> 36:21.929
RENKO: <i>♪ Red-eyed drunk</i>
<i>on the back porch ♪</i>

36:22.013 --> 36:24.515
<i>♪ I'm out there loving you ♪</i>

36:25.016 --> 36:27.268
<i>♪ Out by my window ♪</i>

36:27.351 --> 36:29.061
<i>♪ And I'll know what to do ♪</i>

36:29.145 --> 36:32.148
That's, uh… Oh, no.
Don't go into that place again.

36:32.231 --> 36:34.984
What goes on in there depresses me no end.

36:35.067 --> 36:37.445
Not as much as your singing
depresses me, though, Renko.

36:37.528 --> 36:40.364
You know what? You don't appreciate music
in any way, shape or form.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.700
You like calypso, shopping center music.

36:42.783 --> 36:45.912
(vocalizing)

36:50.750 --> 36:51.918
(knocking)

36:52.668 --> 36:55.379
-Yeah?
-Officer Hill, Shirret.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.590
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.384
Oh, I thought you were alone.
Just a minute.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.636
Mm. Mm.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.226
-No kids.
-Where are the little ones, Shirret?

37:08.309 --> 37:10.019
Shh! They're sleeping in the bedroom.

37:10.603 --> 37:13.356
-So, how's it going?
-Fine.

37:13.439 --> 37:14.941
They're sleeping in the bedroom.

37:15.524 --> 37:19.028
You look like you're stepping out
this evening. You look very nice.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.363
Oh, nice enough?

37:21.322 --> 37:22.198
(chuckles)

37:22.281 --> 37:24.492
For a grown man, you sure act awfully shy.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.868
(chuckles)

37:25.952 --> 37:29.247
If you're gonna be going out tonight,
who's gonna be watching your children?

37:29.330 --> 37:31.249
My girlfriend Darlene.

37:31.332 --> 37:34.043
We made an agreement to watch
each other's so we can go out.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.295
I'm gonna take them
over there in a little while.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.172
Hers are coming here tomorrow.

37:40.549 --> 37:43.135
Sounds like a nice agreement.
Hope it works out.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.345
Oh, it will.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.138
Don't you worry.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.557
Let's go, Renko.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.935
Would you like a glass
of wine or something?

37:51.018 --> 37:52.144
Some juice?

37:52.228 --> 37:54.146
Uh, no, thanks.
If I see your welfare worker,

37:54.230 --> 37:56.857
I'll tell her you're getting
the problem worked out just fine.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.443
Would you? That'd be nice. Thank you.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.153
Let's go, Renko.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.365
-Ma'am.
-Y'all take care now.

38:06.158 --> 38:07.493
You too, Shirret.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.712
(police radio chatter)

38:17.795 --> 38:21.048
You know, I trust that woman about
as far as I can spit canal water.

38:21.924 --> 38:24.343
-She's making an effort.
-Yeah, to recruit you,

38:24.427 --> 38:26.345
between the sheets and otherwise.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.139
These people, I swear.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.684
The best thing you could do for those kids
is to do what the welfare worker wants.

38:31.767 --> 38:34.353
-Get 'em away from her.
-Don't start that stuff on me, Renko,

38:34.437 --> 38:36.522
because I'm not in the mood
to hear it, all right?

38:37.732 --> 38:41.485
Yeah. I guess I'm just an overly critical,

38:42.611 --> 38:44.113
overly sensitive,

38:44.196 --> 38:48.075
highly misanthropic individual
with a wry, skeptical persona.

38:49.618 --> 38:52.580
(laughing)

38:52.663 --> 38:55.207
-Who have you been talking to?
-Been talking to books.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.667
Trying to improve my word power.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.128
-I'm gonna switch my major to English.
-To English, huh?

38:59.211 --> 39:01.839
Would you drop me over to Nash Avenue?
I wanna catch this train.

39:01.922 --> 39:04.008
-Gotta sign out, Professor.
-You can do it for me.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.635
No. Uh-uh. Esterhaus watches
that damn clock like a hawk.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.137
-Just lie for me, partner.
-What?

39:08.220 --> 39:10.222
What are friends for? Lie.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.932
All right, sucker. You owe me one now.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.185
Don't call me sucker.
And I don't owe you anything.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.990
-Psst.
-Hi.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.950
-Hi.
-Come on in.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.036
You come on out.

39:32.620 --> 39:35.373
I'd like to take you to dinner.
I might even pay for it.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.917
Andy, I wish I could.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.127
I teach a class in 40 minutes.

39:41.379 --> 39:45.007
Well, then, I'm just gonna have to spend
the next 40 minutes staring at you.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.970
You have a good day, cowpoke?

39:50.054 --> 39:51.597
I had a usual day.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.393
A bunch of gang punks
and hookers and pimps

39:55.476 --> 39:58.270
and mentally deficient reprobates
out in the street.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.064
My God, you are pretty.

40:01.482 --> 40:05.528
Every single time I close my eyes today,
all I can look at is your face.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.990
Andy, come on. The door is open.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.748
Uh, what do you think you're doing?

40:19.125 --> 40:20.960
Andy, what are you doing?

40:23.087 --> 40:24.130
Andy?

40:25.172 --> 40:28.050
(whispering): Come here. Come here.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.306
I miss you so.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.144
I miss you so.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.522
Oh, Andy, listen, not here.

40:42.481 --> 40:45.568
We got 40 minutes
before you have to teach your class.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.155
And I want you so bad it hurts.

40:50.573 --> 40:51.740
Hmm!

40:53.200 --> 40:54.702
(romantic music playing)

41:01.459 --> 41:04.170
Andy, this is crazy. You know that.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.046
I don't care.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.174
I don't care.

41:12.052 --> 41:15.014
(indistinct chatter)

41:22.730 --> 41:25.691
Oh, Frank, I thought you'd never get here!

41:25.774 --> 41:28.068
I came as soon as I heard, Fay.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.947
I swear, Frank, I get
more support from my panty hose

41:32.031 --> 41:34.909
than I do from the cops
in this garbage dump of a city!

41:34.992 --> 41:36.410
You wanna tell me what happened?

41:36.494 --> 41:37.995
What happened?

41:38.787 --> 41:41.582
I got mugged. That's what happened.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.919
Uh, can I see the report, please?
Thank you.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.548
I tell you, Frank.
This has been one hell of a year.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.593
I mean, first,
I get arrested in a hot tub.

41:53.093 --> 41:57.264
Oh, I believe it was your Sergeant Walsh
that got the initial eyeful.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.808
And then I am terrorized
by obscene phone calls

41:59.892 --> 42:02.228
by that maniac patient of Harvey's.

42:02.311 --> 42:05.856
And now this,
which is truly the highlight.

42:05.940 --> 42:10.277
Frank, they pushed me down on the ground,

42:10.361 --> 42:14.657
and one of 'em had his whole arm up
my dress looking for valuables.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.117
(sobbing)

42:17.826 --> 42:19.954
And where was heroic Harvey?

42:20.037 --> 42:21.080
(laughs)

42:21.163 --> 42:24.166
Harvey just stood there
like an idiot saying,

42:24.250 --> 42:26.710
"Don't panic. Give them what they want."

42:27.336 --> 42:29.421
Give them what they want?

42:30.839 --> 42:32.716
(sobbing): I swear, Frank.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.593
I saw something in Harvey tonight

42:34.677 --> 42:37.346
I don't ever wanna see again…

42:39.765 --> 42:40.891
the real Harvey.

42:43.227 --> 42:46.939
Uh, I'm really sorry
about the engagement ring.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.901
That wasn't all.
They got my, uh, my necklace

42:50.985 --> 42:52.653
and my-- my bracelets,

42:52.736 --> 42:54.989
all my cash, my credit cards.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.408
Oh, and my tear gas canisters.

42:57.491 --> 42:58.993
Wonderful, huh?

42:59.076 --> 43:01.120
Oh, yeah, and-and the alimony check.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.122
No problem.
I'll just write you another one.

43:04.331 --> 43:06.542
Hot X-rays, Ms. Furillo.
You wanna take a look?

43:07.042 --> 43:09.878
Frank, this is Dr. Redman,
the orthopedist.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.340
-How are you?
-How do you do?

43:14.341 --> 43:15.759
Broken thumb right here.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.305
If you don't wanna lose mobility,
you'll need surgery.

43:19.388 --> 43:22.474
-Surgery?
-Yeah. What you got to do is

43:22.558 --> 43:25.394
remove this piece of bone here
floating around in the joint,

43:25.477 --> 43:27.605
otherwise it interferes with the ligament.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.648
It's called a gamekeeper's thumb.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.817
How soon would you have to do this?

43:31.900 --> 43:33.902
I've already booked you an O.R.

43:33.986 --> 43:35.779
You'll be out of here by 9:00 a.m.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.490
No offense, Doctor,
but shouldn't we get a second opinion?

43:38.574 --> 43:40.909
Oh, no offense taken. Uh…

43:40.993 --> 43:43.120
But I'm pretty familiar
with this kind of break.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.999
-I've had a few of them myself.
-The man's All-Pro, Frank.

43:48.208 --> 43:51.503
Oh, Otis Redman. Of course.
Syracuse All-American.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.672
Then you played for St. Louis, right?
Seventy--

43:53.756 --> 43:55.507
Seventy-two to '79.

43:57.843 --> 43:59.595
Well, the officer told me.

44:01.555 --> 44:04.183
-Shall we go for it?
-Will it leave a scar?

44:04.600 --> 44:06.393
Just a little one.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.187
Besides, scars are sexy.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.857
Uh, why don't you two talk this over,

44:11.940 --> 44:13.734
and I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?

44:14.818 --> 44:16.362
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

44:19.948 --> 44:21.200
(sighs)

44:21.283 --> 44:23.202
You sure you wanna
go through with this, Fay?

44:23.744 --> 44:26.455
Well, I'm here. I mean,
we might as well get it over with.

44:26.538 --> 44:28.540
-Besides, I trust him.
-I noticed.

44:29.875 --> 44:33.879
-What about Frank, Jr.?
-He's with my mother tonight.

44:33.962 --> 44:36.382
If you could pick him up,
take him to school in the morning,

44:36.465 --> 44:37.841
and then come back and get me--

44:37.925 --> 44:40.469
-Sure. No problem.
-Thanks.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.932
You know, I'm scared, Frank. (exhales)

44:45.015 --> 44:46.850
Do you want me to stay for the operation?

44:47.476 --> 44:50.020
No, it's not the operation I'm afraid of.

44:51.271 --> 44:53.440
It's the reason for the operation.

44:54.274 --> 44:56.694
I don't like living in a jungle, Frank.

44:56.777 --> 44:59.905
And I don't want to raise Frank, Jr.
in a jungle either.

45:00.406 --> 45:03.033
-I mean, I wanna get outta here.
-(sighs)

45:03.117 --> 45:06.537
All right. Well,
maybe we can talk about that tomorrow.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.415
I don't think I'm gonna
feel any different tomorrow.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.584
Maybe not, but at least we can talk.

45:14.545 --> 45:15.587
Okay.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.173
Are you sure you don't want me to stay?

45:20.092 --> 45:22.344
No, I'm fine. But thanks.

45:22.928 --> 45:24.096
You go ahead.

45:26.932 --> 45:28.934
(woman on P.A., indistinct)

45:32.104 --> 45:35.566
Excuse me. Uh, could you tell me
where the children's ward is, please?

45:35.649 --> 45:36.984
It's third floor, west.

45:49.955 --> 45:50.914
Henry?

45:52.875 --> 45:54.251
Frank, what are you doing here?

45:54.334 --> 45:55.961
I was down in Emergency.

45:56.795 --> 45:57.963
Fay got mugged.

45:58.547 --> 46:00.632
Oh, gee. Is she all right?

46:00.716 --> 46:02.843
Oh, yeah. Broken thumb.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.387
She's scared. The thumb will heal.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.849
While I was here,
I thought I'd check on Josh.

46:09.475 --> 46:10.392
How's it going?

46:11.560 --> 46:12.770
Beats the hell out of me.

46:13.937 --> 46:16.064
They don't know anything.
They're not telling me.

46:16.690 --> 46:19.443
So, we wait.
Rachel and I are taking turns.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.780
-Mind if I wait with you?
-No.

46:31.079 --> 46:32.998
You know, the infuriating part, Frank,

46:34.374 --> 46:37.503
is my little guy's lying there in a coma,
and I can't do a damn thing about it

46:39.421 --> 46:42.591
except wait here with my thumb up my nose,
trying… (exhales)

46:43.383 --> 46:45.010
…not to think about losing him

46:46.261 --> 46:48.305
and not being able to think
about anything else.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.184
Mr. Goldblume,

46:52.684 --> 46:55.062
may I speak with you privately
for a moment, please?

46:55.145 --> 46:57.022
Yeah. Uh, excuse me, Frank.

46:57.105 --> 46:58.065
Sure.

47:00.859 --> 47:03.695
(quiet talking)

47:10.661 --> 47:12.371
(no audible dialogue)

47:31.974 --> 47:34.726
(theme music playing)

47:37.312 --> 47:38.480
(sobbing)

47:42.025 --> 47:43.777
No, he-- he's okay, Frank.

47:44.403 --> 47:47.114
He's come out of the coma.
Doctor says he's gonna be fine.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.699
(sobbing)

47:51.368 --> 47:52.703
(whispers): Thank God.

47:52.786 --> 47:54.329
(sobbing)

48:06.425 --> 48:08.886
(theme music playing)
