00:12.479 --> 00:17.417
<i>I'm a calm guy, quiet, really calm.</i>

00:17.484 --> 00:21.822
But when I'm climbing or competing,
my attitude changes.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.157
Brazil!

00:24.224 --> 00:27.961
<i>My name is Felipe Camargo,</i>
<i>and I am a climbing athlete.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:30.631
<i>My mother says that since I was little,</i>

00:30.697 --> 00:33.734
I would climb trees
at my grandmother's house.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.705
<i>There was a Brazilian grape tree...</i>
<i>This increased my desire to climb.</i>

00:38.772 --> 00:43.277
I am the first climber in Brazil
that can make a living from climbing

00:44.278 --> 00:46.313
<i>and I was invited</i>
<i>to carry the Olympic torch</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:49.449
<i>in the Rio Olympics. It was a huge honor.</i>

00:50.751 --> 00:54.121
<i>I'm here to show that climbers</i>
<i>are ready for anything,</i>

00:54.188 --> 00:56.924
and I'm going to be
the Ultimate Beastmaster. Wait and see.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.525
-Attaboy!
-It was easy!

02:38.592 --> 02:40.927
-Felipe from Brazil!
-Felipe from Brazil!

04:14.321 --> 04:15.889
Brazil!

04:15.956 --> 04:18.458
Brazil!

07:50.370 --> 07:53.306
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>another Brazilian in the competition.</i>

07:53.373 --> 07:56.443
-Let's cheer.
-Come on, cheering. Go, Brazil!

08:30.410 --> 08:33.279
He did it. Very well!

08:39.986 --> 08:42.022
My motto is that we are unlimited.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.224
I think the human being is unlimited.

08:44.658 --> 08:48.161
Athletes, artists, singers
are proving this more and more.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.697
When you think that humanity has a limit,

08:50.764 --> 08:53.100
there is someone who put that limit there.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.762
That's what I feared.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.197
Because I sweat a lot in my hands,
since I was little.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.379
I'm not comfortable.
I'm here to enjoy myself.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.949
And that's what I'm gonna do.

09:47.521 --> 09:51.024
I'm not competing against others.
I'm competing against myself.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.127
If I think I can do it, then I can.

10:03.337 --> 10:07.841
I'd like to conquer the course
cool and collected.

10:33.032 --> 10:37.237
My home is a karate dojo,

10:37.637 --> 10:40.173
so I've always been learning martial arts.

10:59.059 --> 11:03.030
-He grabbed it!
-He made it!

11:03.096 --> 11:06.834
Hanging onto the post, he made it!

12:25.546 --> 12:27.614
-He's good.
-I know!

13:10.757 --> 13:12.192
He made it!

13:26.974 --> 13:30.644
He made it! Chang Suk made it!

13:30.710 --> 13:33.913
Real candidate for Beastmaster!

13:36.583 --> 13:38.552
It feels so great.

13:38.619 --> 13:41.622
I'll carry this momentum
and make Korea proud.

14:03.209 --> 14:06.646
On my first day of high school,
the kids started to bully me.

14:07.748 --> 14:09.349
<i>I felt alone...</i>

14:11.485 --> 14:13.887
<i>When I first started with my acrobatics...</i>

14:15.923 --> 14:17.658
my life changed a lot.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.428
<i>And I'd like to be an example</i>
<i>for all Mexicans</i>

14:21.494 --> 14:24.564
<i>that practice this sport,</i>
<i>and that's my focus.</i>

14:25.165 --> 14:29.336
To be someone kids can look at and think:
"If he can do it, why can't I?"

14:29.403 --> 14:31.705
<i>That's what I'd really love to do.</i>

14:45.319 --> 14:48.555
That's so perfect! You're doing great!

15:10.410 --> 15:14.480
No, Ivan, Ivan, Ivan...

15:36.303 --> 15:39.840
I am always trying to be better
than the day before.

15:39.907 --> 15:44.444
<i>That is my motto.</i>

15:51.517 --> 15:54.454
-No!
-What happened there?

16:05.332 --> 16:07.034
He has to be careful there.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.135
Damn it!

16:08.202 --> 16:09.736
Germany!

16:54.114 --> 16:58.852
I graduated high school, got married,

16:59.318 --> 17:03.322
<i>and had a child. We divorced two years</i>
<i>after the marriage, sadly.</i>

17:04.758 --> 17:10.063
<i>As the parent of a boy,</i>
<i>I knew I needed to get stronger,</i>

17:10.130 --> 17:12.266
<i>so I started CrossFit</i>

17:12.332 --> 17:16.303
<i>to show how a single mother</i>
<i>can live strong.</i>

17:16.370 --> 17:18.572
<i>I'd like to win at Beastmaster.</i>

18:06.286 --> 18:09.089
Brazil!

18:19.199 --> 18:20.968
Don't give up!

18:21.034 --> 18:23.637
<i>Time is running out!</i>

18:23.704 --> 18:25.405
Ah, but she's fallen!

19:19.692 --> 19:21.627
<i>Climbing in Brazil is a very small sport.</i>

19:21.694 --> 19:23.529
<i>When I told people</i>
<i>I wasn't going to study,</i>

19:23.596 --> 19:25.831
<i>that I was going to dedicate myself</i>
<i>to climbing,</i>

19:25.898 --> 19:27.566
everyone said, "You're crazy."

19:27.967 --> 19:30.770
<i>It was not easy, but I'm living the dream.</i>

19:31.437 --> 19:34.040
<i>It's an honor to represent Brazil.</i>

19:34.107 --> 19:37.511
<i>And I'm here to show that the climber</i>
<i>is prepared for anything.</i>

19:37.578 --> 19:40.447
And I'll be the Ultimate Beastmaster.
Watch me.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.820
Look at that! Are you seeing this?
Can you see it?

20:53.887 --> 20:56.423
Felipe is one of the best climbers
in the world.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.261
Look at that! Very explosive.

21:34.328 --> 21:37.965
Felipe is a favorite in this competition.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.908
Very well, Felipe!

22:05.459 --> 22:07.828
I fell because I made a mistake.

22:07.895 --> 22:10.230
I went to the other Dreadmill...

22:11.063 --> 22:13.599
...and ended up taking a false step.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.167
But it's okay, it's cool.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.282
My name is Ludwig and I am from Munich.

22:29.283 --> 22:32.052
I just finished school

22:32.119 --> 22:35.289
and will start studying physics in winter.

22:36.557 --> 22:39.927
<i>I am the Ultimate Beastmaster</i>
<i>because I have all the prerequisites</i>

22:39.993 --> 22:43.497
and am highly motivated
and ready to take on the Beast.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.068
Here we go, Ludwig!

22:48.135 --> 22:49.636
Come on, Ludwig!

23:12.359 --> 23:16.396
Stretch your arms now... yes!

23:29.710 --> 23:33.180
<i>Let's see if the German arrives</i>
<i>at the end of the course</i>

23:33.245 --> 23:34.747
<i>without glasses.</i>

23:34.813 --> 23:39.985
He cannot do anything
without those glasses.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.849
-Now pull yourself up!
-No!

25:16.550 --> 25:18.252
Yes!

25:25.024 --> 25:27.993
Why? He should have taken his time.

25:40.040 --> 25:44.178
The problem was,
when I hit the Point Thruster,

25:44.243 --> 25:48.113
my shoes got wet and I slipped

25:48.715 --> 25:51.118
when I tried to jump over.

26:28.622 --> 26:31.191
Go!

26:31.990 --> 26:33.358
Use your elbow.

26:43.735 --> 26:46.105
I'm tense because of the German.

26:46.173 --> 26:47.875
Are you rooting for the German?

26:47.941 --> 26:50.210
-Brazil is going to be mad at you.
-No.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.118
-Come on.
-Now the jump. Good timing.

27:24.044 --> 27:25.913
He is exhausted.

27:50.537 --> 27:52.339
I can't stand to see him like this!

28:07.354 --> 28:11.892
Honestly, I'm very scared.
But I'm a PE teacher,

28:11.959 --> 28:14.862
and I always tell my students
not to be afraid.

28:14.928 --> 28:17.664
I'll see you in the third round, Beast.

28:22.102 --> 28:23.837
Two more. Come on!

28:29.776 --> 28:33.714
Ivan, you got desperate, brother!
What happened?

28:52.633 --> 28:54.501
Wait a little more.

28:54.568 --> 28:55.636
That was...

29:15.622 --> 29:17.457
He did it!

29:17.524 --> 29:19.426
I showed how Korean guys are strong.

29:19.493 --> 29:22.729
<i>If I make it to the next level,</i>

29:22.796 --> 29:25.465
I'll try to do better.

29:44.818 --> 29:47.321
I've served in the military

29:47.386 --> 29:50.489
<i>for the last ten years</i>

29:51.423 --> 29:52.791
<i>and enjoyed extreme sports.</i>

29:54.361 --> 29:57.531
Chang Suk Bang! Chang Suk Bang!

29:58.966 --> 30:00.701
Go get 'em, Chang Suk Bang!

30:02.401 --> 30:03.902
Go get 'em, Chang Suk Bang!

30:51.051 --> 30:54.721
-Take a break.
-Yeah, just for ten seconds.

31:19.446 --> 31:21.415
-He's crawling up!
-He's got strength.

31:21.481 --> 31:24.251
-He's going up!
-He saved some strength.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.472
I'm so humiliated.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.275
I'm sorry!

31:51.676 --> 31:53.378
This is nonsense!

32:25.913 --> 32:29.283
-Let's go, man!
-He did it!

32:43.931 --> 32:46.300
The platform is already
starting to go down.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.867
He is taking a long time
to get to the end.

33:53.600 --> 33:58.205
I think me and Felipe want
a couple of Brazilians in the final.

33:58.272 --> 34:00.707
And the strategy is to get
as far as possible.

34:00.774 --> 34:04.244
The third level is very tricky.

34:04.311 --> 34:08.382
<i>And the scores are very close.</i>
<i>Everybody is neck and neck.</i>

34:08.448 --> 34:12.753
I am starting Level 3
with a slight point advantage

34:12.819 --> 34:16.857
<i>which I am trying to maintain.</i>

34:16.924 --> 34:19.960
My arm's hurt pretty bad.

34:20.027 --> 34:22.629
And four spots on each of my knees.

34:25.899 --> 34:29.069
All scratched up. It really hurts.

34:30.137 --> 34:32.105
-Are you ready, bro?
-Let's go to the finals.

34:33.607 --> 34:34.608
Let's go.

34:43.050 --> 34:46.420
I'm going to tell you, he's my favorite.

34:46.486 --> 34:48.388
He is our Brazilian hero:

34:48.455 --> 34:50.424
Felipe Camargo!

35:27.961 --> 35:31.665
-He did it!
-Go for it, bro!

36:24.218 --> 36:26.987
-Come on, Ivan!
-Come on, Mexico!

36:34.261 --> 36:37.531
In order to be a better person,
you've got to give it your all.

36:37.598 --> 36:41.235
And you'll never know what that is
if you don't give it a shot.

36:41.301 --> 36:44.071
I don't know
how far I'll get with the Beast.

36:44.137 --> 36:46.206
But I'll give it my best shot.

36:55.349 --> 36:58.952
The Mexican Tarzan went too far!

37:12.833 --> 37:16.270
I don't know why I lost the rope.
I had it and then...

37:16.336 --> 37:19.072
Oh well... I wasn't expecting
to get this far, and I'm happy.

37:19.137 --> 37:22.574
I would've loved to get further, but...

37:28.982 --> 37:32.452
César Curti, from Brazil!

37:32.519 --> 37:35.155
Heck, Anderson, so much emotion.
I'm very excited, too.

38:29.142 --> 38:31.011
I underestimated this one.

38:31.078 --> 38:33.747
<i>I didn't realize the descent</i>
<i>was so slippery.</i>

38:33.814 --> 38:36.550
<i>I wanted to go down with my foot,</i>
<i>but I should have held my hand.</i>

38:36.617 --> 38:39.987
Let's hope no one else manages
to get the rope so I'm still in.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.440
I joined the Army when I was really young.

39:03.243 --> 39:07.748
It's something like Special Forces.

39:07.814 --> 39:09.850
I served for 11 years.

39:09.917 --> 39:13.453
I have the most experience

39:13.520 --> 39:15.055
among all the contestants.

39:32.206 --> 39:33.473
W... What?

39:59.633 --> 40:01.268
I don't believe it.

40:06.807 --> 40:08.408
I'm so humiliated.

40:08.475 --> 40:11.011
That was ridiculous.

40:15.782 --> 40:18.252
We are cheering for César, guys.
Go, Brazil!

40:32.966 --> 40:37.171
I am trying to do my best and have fun.

40:37.237 --> 40:41.074
I will use my skills
to get as far as I can.

40:41.141 --> 40:43.610
-Here we go, Ludwig!
-Ludwig!

41:50.043 --> 41:51.879
He is starting to regret his decision.

41:51.945 --> 41:55.048
This does not look good.

42:02.587 --> 42:05.256
He fell into the water
and those glasses are there, man.

42:05.325 --> 42:06.860
-Dude, those glasses are stuck.
-What? No!

42:06.927 --> 42:09.863
I swear, those glasses are attached. Look.
They are attached.

42:09.930 --> 42:11.965
This guy did some witchcraft there.

42:12.466 --> 42:14.034
I am very happy.

42:14.101 --> 42:17.504
I knew I had reached the final

42:17.571 --> 42:20.974
and wanted to save my energy

42:21.041 --> 42:24.278
for Level 4.

42:57.277 --> 42:59.279
<i>It's an honor to be here</i>
<i>representing Brazil.</i>

42:59.343 --> 43:03.047
I always devote 100% to everything I do.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.182
Brazil!

43:30.477 --> 43:33.714
I will advance as fast as possible
and try to stay focused.

43:44.956 --> 43:45.957
Let's go!

44:04.344 --> 44:06.380
-Here we go, Ludwig!
-Felipe!

45:35.369 --> 45:37.171
-Come on, Ludwig!
-Pull yourself up!

45:37.237 --> 45:38.305
-Here we go!
-Come on!

47:14.067 --> 47:16.870
Brazil did very well here.

47:16.937 --> 47:19.706
Felipe did very well.

47:19.773 --> 47:22.142
Felipe!

47:28.713 --> 47:33.517
-Are you coming with me? I'm going.
-Sure. Wait for me.

47:33.587 --> 47:34.755
Come on!

48:01.815 --> 48:03.383
I'm very happy.

48:03.450 --> 48:05.619
I've been climbing for 15 years.

48:05.686 --> 48:09.590
I knew that if I came to this competition,
it would be mine.

48:09.656 --> 48:11.658
I'm very happy.

48:11.725 --> 48:13.293
Thanks, Brazil!

48:36.016 --> 48:38.552
Brazil, Brazil, Brazil!
