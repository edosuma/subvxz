- WOW, I JUST SAID THAT TO HIM
THIS MORNING AT PRACTICE.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.595
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

05:45.678 --> 05:49.849
- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
SHE'S GOOD TO GO.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.606
AND THIS IS
THE PICK AND ROLL.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.275
- WHAT YOU GUYS DOING?

STANDING IN THE WAY

06:10.203 --> 06:11.537
OF ME AND FREE TICKETS

06:11.621 --> 06:15.375
IS HER IGNORANCE
OF THE GAME.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.794
- COULDN'T I JUST,
YOU KNOW, SLEEP WITH HIM?

06:17.877 --> 06:22.298
- I DON'T WANT THE CHEAP SEATS.
I WANT COURTSIDE.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.136
- ALL RIGHT,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.138
THE GUY WHO LEFT
TO PLAY FOR MIAMI,

06:29.222 --> 06:33.142
IS HIS NAME PRONOUNCED
"LE-BRON" OR "LE-BRAUN"?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.771
- IN THIS HOUSE,
IT'S PRONOUNCED <i> TRAITOR!</i>

07:49.468 --> 07:54.557
WINDOWS WITH GLASS
INSTEAD OF TRASH BAGS!

07:54.640 --> 07:56.392
- WE'VE SET UP A COT FOR YOU
IN THE GARAGE.

07:56.475 --> 07:57.518
- OH, A COT!

07:57.602 --> 07:58.603

08:24.754 --> 08:26.964
- OKAY, WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO WEIRD?

08:27.048 --> 08:31.052
- I'M JUST BEING MY NORMAL,
UPBEAT, LIKEABLE SELF.

08:31.135 --> 08:34.931

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:37.183 --> 08:39.769
WELL, I WAS EMBARRASSED

08:39.852 --> 08:43.981
BUT I AUDITIONED FOR A JOB
AT A LOCAL TV NEWS STATION.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.775
I DIDN'T GET IT.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.110
THEY FOUND ME "UNLIKABLE."

08:48.194 --> 08:50.821
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.575
- I LIKE YOU BETTER THAN JOY.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.163
- THEY WANTED ME TO DO
HUMAN INTEREST STORIES,

08:59.247 --> 09:02.875
BUT YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE
NO INTEREST IN HUMANS.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.294
EXCEPT FOR YOU GUYS.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.129
OH, GOD, I NEED THIS JOB.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.131
- SO...YOU'RE A GREAT ACTRESS.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.842

09:11.926 --> 09:13.803
- PRETEND TO BE INTERESTED.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.098
- PRETEND!
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.308
I'VE BEEN GOING ABOUT THIS
ALL WRONG.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.352
NO, I JUST NEED
TO THINK OF THIS

09:21.435 --> 09:23.354
AS ANOTHER ROLE I'M PLAYING.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.190
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
WHEN THEY ASK ME TO HOST

09:26.274 --> 09:27.650
THOSE CHARITY FUNCTIONS.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.610
I JUST NEED TO PRETEND
TO CARE.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.323
AND FOR THE HOMELESS MAN
KNOWN AS "OPERA GUY,"

09:34.407 --> 09:39.078
THIS FAR-FROM-FAT LADY
HAS SUNG A SONG OF LOVE.

09:39.161 --> 09:42.498

09:52.717 --> 09:56.262
- WOW. NOW THAT
IS A HOME RUN.

09:56.345 --> 10:00.016
- OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD SAY
A <i> HOMELESS</i> RUN.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.351
- [laughing]
NO, YOU DID NOT SAY THAT!

10:02.435 --> 10:04.520
- SO?

10:04.603 --> 10:07.815
- WELCOME TO NORTHEAST OHIO'S
NUMBER THREE TELEVISION STATION.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.532
- IT'S SO GREAT
TO BE WITH A WOMAN

10:16.615 --> 10:17.616
WHO KNOWS SO MUCH
ABOUT BASKETBALL.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.328
SO WHO DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD START AT POWER FORWARD

10:20.411 --> 10:21.495
AGAINST DETROIT?

10:25.249 --> 10:27.209
- HUH?

10:27.293 --> 10:31.047
- SAY, "I'D GO WITH
ANTAWN JAMISON."

10:31.130 --> 10:34.508
- I'D GO WITH
ANTAWN JAMISON.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.553
YOU KNOW, HE'S OLD,
BUT HE HAS A LOT OF GAS LEFT

10:37.636 --> 10:40.890
IN HIS TANK.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.100
- YOU KNOW, LEBRON USED TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.436
- OH, WERE YOU GUYS CLOSE?
- SUPER CLOSE.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.730
HAD ALL MY HOPES AND DREAMS
INVESTED IN HIM.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.566
AND JUST LIKE THE REST
OF THE CITY, IT STILL HURTS.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.276
- WELL, AT LEAST HE'LL
COME BACK AND PLAY

10:52.360 --> 10:53.944
A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR.
THAT SHOULD BE FUN, RIGHT?

10:58.991 --> 11:01.494
- AND I THOUGHT YOU
WERE THE DUMB ONE.

11:06.123 --> 11:10.252
- LADIES...THE SHOWER!

11:10.336 --> 11:12.755
LIKE THE PISS OF ANGELS!

11:12.838 --> 11:15.925
- WOW, YOU CLEAN UP
REALLY WELL.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.426
THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.222
- HAVE YOU SEEN
MY PLASTIC OWL VIBRATO?

11:21.305 --> 11:24.266
HE PROTECTS ME FROM SQUIRRELS.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.268
- ALTHOUGH IT HAS
LESS OF A CHANCE

11:26.352 --> 11:28.270
WITH STATEMENTS LIKE THAT.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.981
- DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS.

11:31.065 --> 11:35.403
- I GOT A BUDDY
THAT TALKS TO HIMSELF TOO.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.697
- NO, SHE'S ON BLUETOOTH.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.450
- WHAT'S THAT LIKE, METH?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.955
- LOOK, HERE ARE SOME ANSWERS
TO QUESTIONS

11:46.038 --> 11:47.456
THE I.N.S. MIGHT ASK US.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.668
PLEASE TRY TO MEMORIZE THEM.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.462
- "JOY SLEEPS ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THE BED.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.339
I SLEEP ON THE LEFT."

11:55.423 --> 11:58.634
AH...

11:58.717 --> 12:00.761
"UNLESS ENGLAND'S
IN THE WORLD CUP,

12:00.845 --> 12:04.306
THEN NOBODY SLEEPS,
SMALL CHUCKLE."

12:04.390 --> 12:06.517
- NO, YOU DON'T SAY
"SMALL CHUCKLE."

12:06.600 --> 12:07.852
YOU CHUCKLE SMALL-Y.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.480
- [exaggerated chuckle]

12:11.564 --> 12:15.526
- FACE IT LEBRON IS
<i>LE-GONE!</i>

12:15.609 --> 12:18.529
- FACE IT, LEBRON IS
LE-OUTTA HERE.

12:18.612 --> 12:22.616
- OH, SHE'S GONE ROGUE.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.660
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I GOTTA LET HIM GO.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.162
- RIGHT. WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO DINNER?

12:26.245 --> 12:28.456
- YOU GOT A FAVORITE PLACE?
- OH, MY GOSH, DOZENS.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.207
CLEVELAND HAS SO MANY
GREAT RESTAURANTS.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.293
THAT'S ANOTHER THING I LOVE
ABOUT THIS CITY.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.419
- GREAT. I WOULD HATE TO THINK
THAT CLEVELAND WAS

12:33.502 --> 12:35.713
JUST SOME STEPPING STONE
FOR YOU TO A LARGER MARKET,

12:35.796 --> 12:40.885
LIKE CHICAGO, NEW YORK...
MIAMI.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.845
- NO, NO, I'M STAYING.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.555
- THAT'S WHAT LEBRON
USED TO SAY.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.057
- HEY, LISTEN, YOU GOTTA
STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.435
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU TOLD LEBRON TO GO.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.480
- UH, ACTUALLY, I DID.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.982
YOU SEE, I WAS TRYING THIS
REVERSE-PSYCHOLOGY THING, AND...

12:55.065 --> 12:57.026
- HE'S TO BLAME!

12:57.109 --> 12:59.069
I'M GONNA KILL THAT MOTHER--

13:08.579 --> 13:11.207
- OH, HI, OHIO.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.919
IT'S VICKI CHASE LIVE
FROM THE SHORES OF LAKE ERIE.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.880
NOT EVERYONE FINDS
OUR CLEVELAND WINTER WEATHER

13:17.963 --> 13:18.839
HARD TO TAKE.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.426
IN FACT, THIS GROUP
OF SPEEDO-CLAD WARRIORS

13:22.510 --> 13:26.722
FINDS IT DOWNRIGHT
POLAR BEAR-ABLE.

13:26.805 --> 13:30.392
IN A FEW MINUTES,
THESE INTREPID HEROES

13:30.476 --> 13:32.269
ARE GOING TO TAKE
THEIR ANNUAL PLUNGE

13:32.353 --> 13:34.104
INTO THE ICY DEPTHS.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.065
AND LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS,

13:36.148 --> 13:42.071
THIS WATER IS...
[bleep] FREEZING!

13:42.154 --> 13:44.949
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY!

13:45.032 --> 13:46.909
AM I WRONG?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.078
TELL YOU WHAT, I AM, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES AWAY

13:49.161 --> 13:50.412
FROM CUTTING OPEN
ONE OF THESE GUYS

13:50.496 --> 13:52.206
AND CRAWLING IN.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.208
[Tv turns off]

13:54.291 --> 13:55.501
- OH, DEAR.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.919
THAT WAS A BIGGER DISASTER

13:57.002 --> 13:58.128
THAN WHEN SHE AD LIBBED
HER WAY

13:58.212 --> 14:00.881
THROUGH THE <i> VAGINA MONOLOGUES.</i>

14:00.965 --> 14:06.220
[doorbell rings]

14:06.303 --> 14:07.721
HELLO.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.765
- I'M PATRICIA WELLONS
WITH THE I.N.S.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.767
I'M HERE FOR A SURPRISE REVIEW.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.103
- BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO MEET YOU TILL NEXT WEEK.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.231
- THAT'S WHY
IT'S CALLED A SURPRISE.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.448
- IT'S JUST SO TOUGH.
- MM.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.117
- THERE'S REMINDERS
OF LEBRON EVERYWHERE.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.244
I STILL CAN'T TAKE
THE NUMBER 23 BUS.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.954
- [chuckles]
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.622
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
I'M GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE

14:33.706 --> 14:36.625
WITH A VERY FAMOUS EX,
AND I'M JUST THE REBOUND.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.794
I'M SORRY.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.338
LOOK, MAYBE THIS IS
JUST A TIME IN YOUR LIFE

14:41.422 --> 14:42.631
WHERE YOU HAVE TO
FORGET THE PAST

14:42.715 --> 14:45.259
AND JUST POWER FORWARD.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.719
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
GO HOME.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.471
I KEEP SAYING THE WRONG THING.
- NO, DON'T GO.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.473
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
THAT I CAN BE NORMAL.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.059
- OKAY, BUT COULD YOU MAYBE
TURN UP THE THERMOSTAT?

14:54.143 --> 14:55.102
IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY
IN HERE.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.854
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I LIKE THE COLD.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.940
- I LIKE THE HEAT.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.069
RIGHT, RIGHT--
MIAMI HEAT.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.197
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD DO THIS ANOTHER TIME.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.534
OKAY?
CAN I GIVE YOU A RING?

15:10.618 --> 15:13.537
RIGHT. NO RING.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.165
NO RINGS EVER.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.791
- AS I WAS SAYING,

15:17.875 --> 15:19.543
WE LIKE TO MEET
WITH EACH OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY

15:19.627 --> 15:21.337
TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOUR STORIES ARE CONSISTENT.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.966
SO HOW DID YOU AND JOY
GET TOGETHER?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.677
- WELL, WHEN WE MET,
I WAS AT A CROSSWALK...

15:28.761 --> 15:30.471
<i>- CROSSROADS!</i>

15:30.554 --> 15:34.475
- CROSSROADS!

15:34.558 --> 15:37.728
AND THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
BLEW INTO MY LIFE

15:37.811 --> 15:39.313
LIKE A TORNADO.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.733
SHE LITERALLY RIPPED THE ROOF
OFF OF MY HOUSE.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.361
- DON'T AD LIB,
JUST REPEAT WHAT I SAY!

15:45.444 --> 15:46.528
- [imitating Joy]
DON'T AD LIB,

15:46.612 --> 15:48.489
JUST REPEAT WHAT I SAY!

15:50.449 --> 15:51.700
- I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME?

15:51.784 --> 15:55.996
- BY THAT I MEAN
SHE CHANGED MY LIFE,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.707
AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE
A MANNEQUIN.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.711
<i>MAN AGAIN!</i>
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.338
SMALL CHUCKLE.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.471
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE MET HER.

16:12.554 --> 16:16.350
- OH, SHE'S LUCKY TOO.
MY HUSBAND'S A BUM.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.143
- OH, REALLY?
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.189
[scratching]

16:22.272 --> 16:23.273
WHAT WAS THAT?

16:23.357 --> 16:25.359
- NOTHING.
PROBABLY A SQUIRREL.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.236
- A SQUIRREL?

16:27.319 --> 16:29.571
OH, NO.
WHERE'S VIBRATO?

16:29.655 --> 16:32.741
- OH, GOOD LORD!
IT'S JUST A <i> SQUIRREL!</i>

16:32.825 --> 16:34.910
- THE SQUIRRELS ARE COMING!
THE WAR'S STARTED!

16:34.993 --> 16:36.078
WHERE'S VIBRATO?

16:36.161 --> 16:38.122
- JUST GET BACK OUT THERE.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.375
- I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE A DATE WITH DESTINY.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.253
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

16:51.301 --> 16:54.346
- I FIND IT SEXY.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.352
- SO YOU PICKED A HOMELESS MAN
TO GET YOUR GREEN CARD?

17:00.436 --> 17:03.063
- WAS THAT BAD?
SHOULD I NOT HAVE DONE THAT?

17:03.147 --> 17:06.108
I'M NEW TO YOUR COUNTRY.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.068
- YOUR FIANCE IS TRYING
TO GET A SQUIRREL

17:08.152 --> 17:09.778
TO SIGN A PEACE TREATY.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.573
- I HAVE A LONG RIDE.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.281
DO YOU MIND IT I USE
YOUR BATHROOM?

17:13.365 --> 17:16.452
- DOWN THE HALL
TO THE LEFT.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.579
WHY DOES THIS
KEEP HAPPENING?

17:19.663 --> 17:20.789
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.001
IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH
AN AIRTIGHT PLAN.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.795
[door opens]

17:26.878 --> 17:29.673
- WELL, I ASSUME
YOU ALL WITNESSED

17:29.757 --> 17:31.800
MY CAREER SUICIDE.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.594
THEY FIRED ME.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.846
- OH, HONEY,
IT'S JUST ONE JOB.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.974
YOU'VE HAD DRY SPELLS BEFORE.
THE RIGHT PART WILL COME ALONG.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.309
- WELL, WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

17:40.392 --> 17:41.935
I MEAN,
WHAT IF IT'S OVER?

17:42.019 --> 17:44.813
IF I'M NOT IN FRONT
OF A CAMERA, THEN WHO AM I?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.357
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF THE UN-TELEVISED LIFE

17:47.441 --> 17:48.650
IS WORTH LIVING.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.032
- SORRY, ELKA,
NO COURTSIDE TICKETS.

17:55.115 --> 17:59.244
- YOU SLEPT WITH HIM.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.705
- NO.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.332
BUT WHY IS EVERYONE
IN THIS TOWN

18:03.415 --> 18:05.000
SO OBSESSED WITH THEIR TEAMS?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.503
- MY SEGMENT WAS A HIT!

18:07.586 --> 18:10.130
THE STATION SAID
THEY'VE BEEN FLOODED WITH CALLS.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.716
APPARENTLY I SAY
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.968
AND LUCKILY FOR ME,
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING

18:15.052 --> 18:16.970
IS COMPLETELY UNLIKABLE.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.014
OH, WE HAVE COMPANY.

18:19.097 --> 18:22.142
HELLO, VICTORIA CHASE,
FROM OH, HI, OHIO.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.269
CHECK LOCAL LISTINGS.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.563
- THIS IS PATRICIA WELLONS,
FROM THE I.N.S.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.357
- OH, HI.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.025
- I'M BEING DEPORTED.
- WHAT?

18:30.108 --> 18:32.361
- BUT JOY AND HER FIANCE
ARE SO IN LOVE.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.987
- I KNOW HE'S A HOMELESS MAN.

18:34.071 --> 18:37.533
- BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO--SO HEARTWARMING.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.701
- THANKS FOR TRYING,
BUT IT'S OVER.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.411
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS
BE OVER.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.663
- NO, ME EITHER.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.081
I MEAN,
I'LL MARRY HER MYSELF,

18:44.164 --> 18:46.250
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.670
- I CAN'T STAND HER,
BUT I STILL WANT HER TO STAY.

18:49.753 --> 18:53.048
SHE GETS ME.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.883
- LISTEN, JOY MAY NOT
BE MARRIED,

18:54.967 --> 18:58.387
BUT SHE HAS DEEP TIES
TO THIS COUNTRY--US.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.388
- YOU KNOW,
AND IN A LOT OF WAYS,

18:59.471 --> 19:01.473
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS STRONGER
THAN ANY MARRIAGE.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.684
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
LONGER THAN

19:03.767 --> 19:05.894
ALL FOUR OF MY MARRIAGES
COMBINED.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.731
- IT'S FIVE.
- FIVE.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.776
SHOOT, I ALWAYS FORGET
ERNIE HUDSON.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.113
- WE'RE A FAMILY.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.699
IF YOU DEPORT JOY,
YOU'LL BREAK <i> US</i> UP.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.368
- YOU ALL LIVE HERE TOGETHER?
- MM-HMM.

19:21.451 --> 19:26.582
- WE CERTAINLY DO.
WE'RE LIKE SISTERS.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.250
- YOU KNOW, MY GIRLFRIENDS
AND I OFTEN JOKE

19:28.333 --> 19:30.919
ABOUT LIVING TOGETHER AND
HAVING OUR HUSBANDS COME VISIT.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.087
BUT YOU LADIES ARE
DOING IT.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.463
I ADMIRE THAT.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.591
- SO YOU'LL GET ME
A GREEN CARD?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.926
- NO.
- OH, CAN'T YOU JUST LET HER--

19:38.010 --> 19:40.262
- OKAY, WHAT I WILL DO
IS GIVE YOU AN EXTENSION

19:40.345 --> 19:41.930
SO THAT YOU HAVE MORE TIME
TO FILE AN APPEAL

19:42.014 --> 19:43.098
TO STAY HERE LEGALLY.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.559
- OH, THANK YOU.

19:48.145 --> 19:54.067
- YOU KNOW, YOU LADIES REALLY
HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL HERE.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.486
- OH, JOY.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.281
I'VE HAD SOME TIME TO THINK,

19:59.364 --> 20:02.910
AND I CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH THIS SHAM MARRIAGE.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.621
WHEN I GET MARRIED,
I WANT IT TO BE FOR REAL.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.788
FOR LOVE.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.918
HUSH, VIBRATO!
I <i> TOLD</i> HER!

20:12.836 --> 20:16.298
- IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
SHE CAN'T EVEN HANG ON

20:16.381 --> 20:18.467
TO A HOMELESS MAN!
