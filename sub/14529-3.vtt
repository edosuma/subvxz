WEBVTT

00:05.772 --> 00:11.209
(narrator) Previously on "The
Making of the Mob: New York"...

00:11.211 --> 00:14.045
Charles Luciano
and his crew,

00:14.047 --> 00:15.479
Meyer Lansky,

00:15.481 --> 00:16.680
Bugsy Siegel...

00:16.682 --> 00:19.182
You mind if I
finish this off?

00:19.184 --> 00:22.018
(groaning)

00:22.020 --> 00:23.486
(narrator)
...Frank Costello,

00:23.488 --> 00:25.387
and Vito Genovese,

00:25.389 --> 00:28.022
have worked their way up
in the New York underworld...

00:28.024 --> 00:30.124
We're gonna try
something out here.

00:30.126 --> 00:31.291
I'll give you a shot,

00:31.293 --> 00:33.359
see if you don't
screw it up.

00:33.361 --> 00:35.761
(narrator) ...with the guidance
of sophisticated gangster

00:35.763 --> 00:37.462
Arnold Rothstein.

00:37.464 --> 00:41.699
There's safety in no one
knowing who you are.

00:41.701 --> 00:45.035
Nobody targets
a nobody.

00:49.407 --> 00:52.342
(narrator) After a citywide
turf war breaks out

00:52.344 --> 00:56.112
between rival kingpins
Salvatore Maranzano

00:56.114 --> 00:58.047
and Joe Masseria...

00:58.049 --> 01:00.582
If you even suspect
anybody's with Maranzano,

01:00.584 --> 01:03.318
and I mean anybody,

01:03.320 --> 01:04.752
kill him.

01:07.055 --> 01:09.189
(narrator) ...Luciano is
caught in the crossfire...

01:12.159 --> 01:16.095
...and Arnold Rothstein
is gunned down in the streets.

01:16.097 --> 01:17.463
(gunshot)

01:17.465 --> 01:19.398
Tomorrow I want you
to call up Masseria,

01:19.400 --> 01:23.235
and you set up a meeting
in Coney Island.

01:23.237 --> 01:25.237
(narrator)
To end the conflict,

01:25.239 --> 01:27.706
Luciano orchestrates
the assassinations

01:27.708 --> 01:29.174
of Masseria...

01:33.412 --> 01:34.412
...and Maranzano...

01:34.414 --> 01:35.780
(knife slicing)
Uh! Uhh!

01:45.089 --> 01:47.190
(gunshots)

01:52.429 --> 01:54.596
(narrator)
...and can now take his place

01:54.598 --> 01:57.465
at the top
of the New York underworld.

03:04.289 --> 03:05.889
(grunting)

03:29.813 --> 03:34.849
(narrator) After taking out the two
most powerful Mob bosses in New York,

03:34.851 --> 03:37.585
34-year-old
Charles "Lucky" Luciano

03:37.587 --> 03:40.888
sets in motion
the next phase of his plan:

03:40.890 --> 03:44.825
to seize control
of the New York Mafia.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.830
Luciano and his crew--

03:50.832 --> 03:52.464
Meyer Lansky,

03:52.466 --> 03:54.199
Frank Costello,

03:54.201 --> 03:55.533
Bugsy Siegel,

03:55.535 --> 03:57.635
and Vito Genovese--

03:57.637 --> 04:00.638
send an army of hit men
to eliminate loyalists

04:00.640 --> 04:03.941
of the New York underworld's
old regimes.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.376
Find someone.

04:06.378 --> 04:07.677
But it's got to be done.

04:07.679 --> 04:10.379
You tell me what
you want me to do.

04:10.381 --> 04:11.947
I'll take care of him.

04:13.349 --> 04:15.249
I think goodfellas
rise in the groups

04:15.251 --> 04:18.285
because they are ruthless.

04:18.287 --> 04:19.686
They were killers.

04:19.688 --> 04:21.454
I mean, that's a known fact.

04:21.456 --> 04:23.622
It's a competitive game
for them.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.484
Aagh...

04:53.486 --> 04:55.586
(gurgling)

04:55.588 --> 04:57.287
(narrator)
Over the next few days,

04:57.289 --> 04:59.989
gangsters across the country
are murdered

04:59.991 --> 05:03.325
in the biggest purge
the Mafia has ever seen.

05:14.436 --> 05:16.270
Easy, Joe.

05:16.272 --> 05:17.904
Easy.

05:17.906 --> 05:19.605
Jesus, Vito.

05:19.607 --> 05:21.473
Look, don't do
anything stupid.

05:21.475 --> 05:24.375
I ain't here
to kill you.

05:24.377 --> 05:25.843
Then, what is this?

05:27.478 --> 05:29.445
Lucky wants
to talk to you.

05:31.314 --> 05:33.982
(narrator)
Luciano spares a select few

05:33.984 --> 05:36.985
who he feels are more valuable
as allies.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.557
With his power secured,

05:44.559 --> 05:46.992
Luciano makes his next move,

05:46.994 --> 05:49.961
calling a meeting with
Maranzano's former underboss

05:49.963 --> 05:51.929
Joe Bonanno.

05:51.931 --> 05:54.430
Killing Maranzano
was necessary.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.534
It was either gonna be
him or me,

05:59.536 --> 06:02.003
and it wasn't gonna be me.

06:02.005 --> 06:05.339
The past is the past.

06:05.341 --> 06:08.508
(narrator) Luciano sees
potential in Bonanno,

06:08.510 --> 06:11.844
a man not tied to
the old-school Sicilian ways...

06:13.847 --> 06:15.614
...and decides to offer Bonanno

06:15.616 --> 06:18.383
the opportunity
to head his own family.

06:18.385 --> 06:19.650
(Gay Talese)
Joe Bonanno,

06:19.652 --> 06:21.451
he owned garment-centered
operations

06:21.453 --> 06:22.685
on 34th Street.

06:22.687 --> 06:24.053
He owned trucking businesses,

06:24.055 --> 06:25.721
all kinds of businesses.

06:25.723 --> 06:29.558
So he was a man of wealth,
a man of influence,

06:29.560 --> 06:31.726
a man of reason.

06:31.728 --> 06:33.661
(narrator)
With Bonanno on board,

06:33.663 --> 06:37.765
Luciano has eliminated
his competition,

06:37.767 --> 06:40.934
establishing order
in his operation.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.042
(Selwyn Raab) Maranzano's
gone, Masseria's gone,

06:50.044 --> 06:53.979
and Luciano is at the top
of the hill.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.047
But Luciano decides

06:56.049 --> 06:58.816
the most important thing
to be done

06:58.818 --> 07:02.619
is to create organizations

07:02.621 --> 07:04.621
that won't war
with each other.

07:04.623 --> 07:06.756
They need a regimen,
rules.

07:06.758 --> 07:11.460
Otherwise they'll be
going through this all the time.

07:11.462 --> 07:14.863
(narrator) Luciano turns to
his homeland for inspiration.

07:19.001 --> 07:20.801
Unlike in America,

07:20.803 --> 07:24.704
the Sicilian Mafia has always
been strictly organized.

07:24.706 --> 07:27.039
There are nearly 100 gangs

07:27.041 --> 07:29.908
referred to
as crime families.

07:29.910 --> 07:32.543
Each family has a boss,

07:32.545 --> 07:35.445
and they all work
under the<i> capo di tutti capi--</i>

07:35.447 --> 07:37.713
the boss of bosses.

07:37.715 --> 07:40.582
It's almost like the aristocracy
of the underworld.

07:40.584 --> 07:42.617
Men who were family heads

07:42.619 --> 07:45.987
needed to establish
some rules and boundaries

07:45.989 --> 07:47.855
and understanding

07:47.857 --> 07:51.725
for the continuation
of their way of life.

07:51.727 --> 07:54.794
(narrator) It's a system that
has worked for over 100 years

07:54.796 --> 07:58.397
and is known as Cosa Nostra,

07:58.399 --> 08:00.399
which translates
to "Our Thing."

08:05.071 --> 08:07.806
Luciano bases the structure
of his new Mafia

08:07.808 --> 08:09.741
on the Cosa Nostra

08:09.743 --> 08:11.509
with one big change.

08:11.511 --> 08:12.676
You just got
to make sure

08:12.678 --> 08:14.044
that when you sell them
something new,

08:14.046 --> 08:15.912
you make it seem old.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.748
You know Sicilians
better than Sicilians, huh?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.583
(chuckles)
Huh?

08:21.585 --> 08:24.052
(narrator) To gain the support
of the other Mob bosses,

08:24.054 --> 08:28.523
Luciano keeps Mafia membership
limited to Italians.

08:28.525 --> 08:31.959
But Lansky will remain
Luciano's most trusted advisor

08:31.961 --> 08:35.696
from outside
the Mafia's ranks.

08:35.698 --> 08:37.764
Usually you know it was--
Especially the Sicilian Mafia,

08:37.766 --> 08:39.132
that was it.

08:39.134 --> 08:41.601
Actually, you had to be
a Sicilian to be made.

08:41.603 --> 08:43.769
You gotta be Italian.

08:43.771 --> 08:45.604
But Lucky was like, "Hey,

08:45.606 --> 08:47.172
"these guys got
great business.

08:47.174 --> 08:49.607
I'm gonna deal with them."

08:49.609 --> 08:51.075
(narrator)
Luciano is ready to present

08:51.077 --> 08:54.445
the one big change he's made
to the Cosa Nostra

08:54.447 --> 08:59.716
that he knows will revolutionize
the American Mafia forever.

09:09.626 --> 09:12.127
(Raab) Luciano called
for a major meeting

09:12.129 --> 09:14.462
of the crime bosses
in New York

09:14.464 --> 09:17.031
and major gangsters
elsewhere.

09:17.033 --> 09:18.232
Until this time,

09:18.234 --> 09:21.068
there really is no Mafia
in America.

09:21.070 --> 09:23.136
You have individual gangs
operating

09:23.138 --> 09:27.807
in some kind of ad hoc
manner.

09:27.809 --> 09:31.743
Luciano saw that
this had to be changed.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.981
Lucky, good to see you.
It's good to see you.

09:40.652 --> 09:41.718
Al.

09:50.494 --> 09:53.762
The blood on the streets
must stop,

09:53.764 --> 09:56.731
and the cycles
of revenge must end.

09:56.733 --> 09:59.033
We may be criminals,

09:59.035 --> 10:02.036
but that doesn't
mean we're savages.

10:02.038 --> 10:06.507
We have to run our business
like a business.

10:06.509 --> 10:08.976
To begin, we'll start
organizing our families

10:08.978 --> 10:10.844
like we did in Sicily,

10:10.846 --> 10:14.180
with the capos, the crews,
the consiglieres

10:14.182 --> 10:16.916
all reporting to
the head of the family.

10:16.918 --> 10:20.953
But there will be
no more boss of bosses.

10:20.955 --> 10:23.956
The days of
the<i> capo di tutti capi,</i>

10:23.958 --> 10:25.857
they're over.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.526
Instead we'll have
a board of directors,

10:28.528 --> 10:31.997
a Commission run by the heads
of the five New York families.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.966
They will have
the final say in all matters,

10:34.968 --> 10:37.868
even life and death.

10:40.104 --> 10:41.704
The heads of the five
New York families,

10:41.706 --> 10:44.406
the members of
the Commission, are...

10:44.408 --> 10:45.940
Giuseppe Profaci...

10:48.743 --> 10:50.310
Vincent Mangano...

10:52.279 --> 10:54.213
Tommy Gagliano...

10:55.648 --> 10:57.882
Joseph Bonanno...

11:00.986 --> 11:02.953
and Lucky Luciano.

11:04.188 --> 11:07.023
(narrator)
Luciano creates the Commission,

11:07.025 --> 11:10.059
a board made up of the heads
of the five New York families

11:10.061 --> 11:14.897
who will run the Mafia
instead of a boss of bosses.

11:14.899 --> 11:18.033
(man)
Luciano's motivation was power.

11:18.035 --> 11:21.302
He would give a role
to all these other guys

11:21.304 --> 11:23.771
because he was smart.

11:23.773 --> 11:25.773
He knew how to play people.

11:25.775 --> 11:27.141
And if you share power
the right way,

11:27.143 --> 11:29.109
you have the power.

11:29.111 --> 11:31.778
In effect, Lucky is writing

11:31.780 --> 11:34.313
a constitution for the Mafia.

11:34.315 --> 11:38.183
There will be
a boss of each family,

11:38.185 --> 11:39.717
there will be
a second-in-command--

11:39.719 --> 11:41.685
an underboss--

11:41.687 --> 11:44.154
and there will be
a consigliere-- the counselor.

11:48.359 --> 11:51.260
To peace and profit.

11:51.262 --> 11:53.128
(applause)

11:57.700 --> 12:01.402
Luciano creates
the modern Mafia.

12:01.404 --> 12:04.037
He is the main architect
of what would be

12:04.039 --> 12:07.940
the American Mafia
for the rest of the century.

12:12.111 --> 12:15.146
To peace and profit.

12:15.148 --> 12:16.447
(applause)

12:16.449 --> 12:17.948
(narrator)
In a matter of months,

12:17.950 --> 12:19.249
Lucky Luciano has taken out

12:19.251 --> 12:22.752
the two criminal kingpins
of New York

12:22.754 --> 12:24.720
and brought together
the most powerful

12:24.722 --> 12:27.255
and violent gangsters
in America

12:27.257 --> 12:30.024
under a board of directors
known as the Commission.

12:33.895 --> 12:35.228
One thing we
never want to do

12:35.230 --> 12:36.829
is make problems
for ourselves.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.130
You understand?

12:39.932 --> 12:44.101
(narrator) The Commission has
final say on all matters

12:44.103 --> 12:47.837
from dividing territory
to ordering hits.

12:49.506 --> 12:51.106
(Rich Cohen)
They sort of said,

12:51.108 --> 12:53.174
"We're not gonna have
these random killings

12:53.176 --> 12:55.009
"where one guy gets pissed off
at another guy

12:55.011 --> 12:57.044
"and he goes off
and he just kills him.

12:57.046 --> 12:59.379
"So, we're gonna do it like
they do it in the real world,

12:59.381 --> 13:02.515
"which is if somebody has
a problem with somebody else,

13:02.517 --> 13:04.817
"he will go
to an underworld court,

13:04.819 --> 13:06.919
and he will plead his case."

13:08.821 --> 13:12.089
They were like
the Security Council of the U.N.

13:12.091 --> 13:14.491
And I know that's laughable
in many ways,

13:14.493 --> 13:16.159
but they used
to try to resolve

13:16.161 --> 13:18.828
as many of their problems
peacefully as possible

13:18.830 --> 13:20.262
to stay away from the law.

13:20.264 --> 13:22.330
Disputes would get reported
to the Commission,

13:22.332 --> 13:24.832
and most of them
would get settled.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.099
Of course,
when they didn't get settled,

13:26.101 --> 13:28.801
then a murder might have
to take place.

13:28.803 --> 13:31.236
(narrator) To carry out the
Mafia's approved hit list,

13:31.238 --> 13:33.471
Luciano knows he will
need an enforcement arm

13:33.473 --> 13:36.273
with no ties
to the Italian Commission.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.842
So he looks outside
the Five Families

13:38.844 --> 13:41.177
to a group
of Jewish gangsters.

13:47.450 --> 13:51.920
In 1931, Luciano orders his
most trusted business partner

13:51.922 --> 13:54.088
to assemble
the lethal team.

13:54.090 --> 13:57.124
(Rich Cohen) Lansky was
like a recruiter, you know?

13:57.126 --> 13:58.525
At a board meeting
for a college.

13:58.527 --> 14:01.127
"Hey, I know
who could play free safety."

14:01.129 --> 14:03.129
You know, he knew
who they were

14:03.131 --> 14:05.998
and he recommended them
as the guys that could

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
fill this new role
that was suddenly created

14:08.002 --> 14:09.201
by this underworld court.

14:16.074 --> 14:17.841
(narrator)
Lansky quickly enlists

14:17.843 --> 14:20.109
an elite group
of Jewish hit men.

14:22.045 --> 14:25.047
Violent killers who will
come to be known...

14:25.049 --> 14:27.082
as Murder, Inc.

14:27.084 --> 14:29.951
All right, this is
how it's gonna work.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.086
The Commission will
confirm all hits.

14:32.088 --> 14:35.055
You guys get your orders,
you do your job.

14:35.057 --> 14:37.490
Be precise.

14:37.492 --> 14:39.992
You guys'll be
like ghosts.

14:39.994 --> 14:42.327
Nothing gets left
behind, nothing.

14:44.496 --> 14:46.196
(Meyer Lansky II)
It was kind of a sub-company

14:46.198 --> 14:49.532
of the new modern Mafia
that Luciano designed.

14:49.534 --> 14:52.468
But you have to realize
most of the hit men were Jewish.

14:52.470 --> 14:54.536
The reason being,
the law enforcement

14:54.538 --> 14:58.172
didn't expect Jewish guys
to be hit men.

14:58.174 --> 15:00.374
They integrated,
so that threw 'em off.

15:07.014 --> 15:10.483
(narrator) Each hit man has
his own signature style.

15:10.485 --> 15:13.853
Bugsy Siegel is a loyal member
of Luciano's crew

15:13.855 --> 15:17.056
who takes pleasure
in making his victims suffer.

15:17.058 --> 15:20.926
(grunting)

15:27.933 --> 15:30.034
Albert Anastasia
is a feared killer

15:30.036 --> 15:33.203
with a short fuse
and deadly aim

15:33.205 --> 15:37.306
who becomes known
as the Lord High Executioner.

15:39.876 --> 15:42.878
Abe Reles believes
in a hands-on approach,

15:42.880 --> 15:45.347
earning the nickname
"Kid Twist"

15:45.349 --> 15:47.582
for his preferred
method of killing.

15:47.584 --> 15:49.350
(gagging)

15:49.352 --> 15:52.953
Strangling his victims
with wire.

15:52.955 --> 15:55.555
Louis Lepke is
a disciplined assassin,

15:55.557 --> 15:59.125
isolating his targets
to avoid witnesses.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.426
(gunshot)

16:03.395 --> 16:06.063
As a little kid, I remember
hearing the stories about

16:06.065 --> 16:09.466
these Jewish killers
the Mobsters had,

16:09.468 --> 16:12.135
and the Italians,
how they worked with them

16:12.137 --> 16:15.638
and how they respected
these murderers.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.007
These were guys that
were the baddest of bad.

16:18.009 --> 16:21.944
They were cold-blooded murderers
that worked for the Mob.

16:21.946 --> 16:26.381
(narrator) They formed the deadliest
team of hit men in American history

16:26.383 --> 16:30.251
and transformed the art
of killing into a science.

16:34.089 --> 16:37.224
Once a contract
is handed down,

16:37.226 --> 16:41.127
the assassin spends weeks
preparing the execution.

16:41.129 --> 16:42.561
Assembling weapons,

16:42.563 --> 16:45.030
stealing
a getaway car,

16:45.032 --> 16:46.631
and trailing his target.

16:50.168 --> 16:54.371
When the moment is right,
he makes a clean hit

16:54.373 --> 16:56.639
and begins
covering his tracks.

17:03.045 --> 17:06.514
Fingerprints are often
burned beyond recognition,

17:06.516 --> 17:08.349
and the body is
dumped in a river

17:08.351 --> 17:11.652
or buried with chemicals
to eliminate the smell.

17:15.657 --> 17:17.324
In just ten years,

17:17.326 --> 17:20.393
Murder, Inc. will kill
more than 1,000 people,

17:20.395 --> 17:24.663
averaging one murder
every three days.

17:24.665 --> 17:28.299
And because no ties to
the assassins are left behind,

17:28.301 --> 17:31.502
hundreds of murders remain
unsolved for years.

17:32.971 --> 17:35.005
(Rich Cohen)
The newspapers did know

17:35.007 --> 17:38.341
dead bodies killed
in a similar way

17:38.343 --> 17:41.544
started turning up
all over the country.

17:41.546 --> 17:45.347
And they knew that it was
probably one group of guys.

17:45.349 --> 17:48.216
And that's really the story
of Murder, Incorporated.

17:57.692 --> 17:59.459
(narrator)
With the Commission in place

17:59.461 --> 18:01.494
and Murder, Inc.
on call,

18:01.496 --> 18:05.564
Lucky Luciano has created
an underground government

18:05.566 --> 18:07.599
and an invisible army.

18:07.601 --> 18:10.068
(Chazz Palminteri) Lucky Luciano
delegated the violence.

18:10.070 --> 18:12.103
He said,
"If we all band together,"

18:12.105 --> 18:15.239
you know, "we could do
this thing as an organization."

18:15.241 --> 18:17.407
So there'd be order.

18:17.409 --> 18:20.009
When you don't have order,
then it's chaos.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.011
You get destroyed.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.146
(narrator) Luciano believes
his national organization

18:24.148 --> 18:26.515
is built to last.

18:26.517 --> 18:28.316
But what
he doesn't realize

18:28.318 --> 18:31.719
is that the Mob is about
to face its biggest threat...

18:31.721 --> 18:34.321
from within.

18:38.025 --> 18:42.294
♪♪

18:42.296 --> 18:44.095
(narrator)
Lucky Luciano's Commission

18:44.097 --> 18:46.363
is organizing
the criminal world...

18:48.632 --> 18:50.633
...into an efficient
money-making machine.

18:52.502 --> 18:55.370
But one of Luciano's
biggest earners

18:55.372 --> 18:57.605
is a Jewish gangster

18:57.607 --> 19:00.741
who isn't part
of the Five Families.

19:03.277 --> 19:07.446
(Selwyn Raab) Dutch Schultz
ran a very powerful gang

19:07.448 --> 19:10.682
in New York and the Bronx.

19:10.684 --> 19:13.351
In fact, some people
used to go around saying,

19:13.353 --> 19:15.586
in New York,
there was a Big Six,

19:15.588 --> 19:17.688
not just a Big Five,

19:17.690 --> 19:20.223
because Schultz
was so important.

19:20.225 --> 19:24.261
(narrator) Dutch Schultz is known
as the Beer Baron of the Bronx.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.430
He muscles his way into
the restaurant unions

19:27.432 --> 19:30.599
and Harlem's
number rackets.

19:30.601 --> 19:33.234
His numbers operation alone

19:33.236 --> 19:37.404
brings in
$20 million a year.

19:38.806 --> 19:40.640
Schultz is also
a vicious gangster

19:40.642 --> 19:42.608
with a hair-trigger
temper.

19:42.610 --> 19:45.711
(gunshot)
(screaming)

20:03.262 --> 20:05.329
Schultz has been
building relationships

20:05.331 --> 20:07.731
with politicians
for years

20:07.733 --> 20:09.833
by fixing
their elections.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.268
Come on, boys,
all right, let's go.

20:12.270 --> 20:13.736
(indistinct chatter)

20:13.738 --> 20:15.804
Right to the front,
come on.

20:17.873 --> 20:19.473
(narrator)
Schultz pays off voters

20:19.475 --> 20:21.608
and brings them
to the polls...

20:23.844 --> 20:26.579
...so they can vote
for his candidates.

20:26.581 --> 20:28.781
There was no doubt that
the American Mafia

20:28.783 --> 20:31.717
took advantage
of all their connections

20:31.719 --> 20:33.552
with corrupt politicians,

20:33.554 --> 20:35.854
and when they saw
the opportunity to make money,

20:35.856 --> 20:38.957
certainly taking it
from the federal government,

20:38.959 --> 20:41.492
this is what we did.

20:41.494 --> 20:43.560
Can I ask
your business here?

20:49.566 --> 20:51.567
Tampering with elections
is illegal.

20:51.569 --> 20:54.002
Ah...

20:54.004 --> 20:56.004
I'll keep that
in mind.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.709
(narrator)
Schultz is unaware

21:02.711 --> 21:05.712
that he's just
caught the eye

21:05.714 --> 21:10.349
of the one man in New York
he can't pay off.

21:10.351 --> 21:12.818
A 32-year-old lawyer
from Michigan

21:12.820 --> 21:15.520
named Thomas E. Dewey.

21:18.957 --> 21:21.658
Thomas Dewey is
an assistant U.S. attorney

21:21.660 --> 21:25.361
with political
aspirations.

21:25.363 --> 21:28.397
In New York City, people
are voting multiple times.

21:28.399 --> 21:30.532
Tom Dewey had been
a poll-watcher at one point

21:30.534 --> 21:32.700
and had seen this,
and it probably inspired

21:32.702 --> 21:35.502
some of his later
prosecutions.

21:35.504 --> 21:38.505
(narrator) He'll go on to
become the governor of New York

21:38.507 --> 21:40.607
and run for president...

21:40.609 --> 21:43.042
(Dewey)
We are a united party.

21:43.044 --> 21:45.911
Our nation stands
tragically in need

21:45.913 --> 21:48.480
of that same unity.

21:48.482 --> 21:50.615
(narrator) ...losing one of
the most famous elections

21:50.617 --> 21:54.018
in American history.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.720
I learned a lot of lessons
about being a lawyer

21:56.722 --> 21:58.521
from reading about
great lawyers,

21:58.523 --> 22:01.524
and Tom Dewey
was an inspiration.

22:01.526 --> 22:04.860
I mean, I learned many lessons
of leadership from Dewey.

22:22.044 --> 22:25.445
(narrator) Dewey firmly
believes in the rule of law.

22:27.848 --> 22:30.716
He also wants to make
a name for himself in New York.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.587
(Edward McDonald) When Tom Dewey
went after Lucky Luciano,

22:35.589 --> 22:37.322
he went after him
because he was

22:37.324 --> 22:40.358
a major organized crime figure
in the United States.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.959
He saw this
as a stepping stone,

22:41.961 --> 22:44.795
a way that he could
burnish his resume

22:44.797 --> 22:46.863
so that he would be able
to run for political office,

22:46.865 --> 22:50.466
and ultimately run for the
presidency of the United States.

22:50.468 --> 22:54.069
(narrator) With the New York
kingpin protected by corruption,

22:54.071 --> 22:55.670
Dewey knows
he'll have to start

22:55.672 --> 22:58.806
by going after Luciano's
known associates,

22:58.808 --> 23:02.376
including the man helping
to fix local elections,

23:02.378 --> 23:03.809
Dutch Schultz.

23:06.679 --> 23:10.881
(phone ringing)

23:12.683 --> 23:14.016
This is the guy.
What guy?

23:14.018 --> 23:16.651
The guy from the polls,
Dutch Schultz.

23:16.653 --> 23:17.885
You don't give up,
do you?

the Jersey waterfront.

23:25.591 --> 23:28.059
Schultz works
with Lucky Luciano.

23:31.997 --> 23:34.531
Schultz is nothing

Dutch Schultz.

paying off judges

24:32.412 --> 24:35.846

(Thomas Dewey III)
It's very difficult for people

in our time really to understand

24:40.886 --> 24:45.622
how widespread corruption in
New York City at that time was.

My grandfather was very offended

To bring down Schultz,

to find a way

24:55.765 --> 24:57.698
to prosecute him.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.467
And a trial
from a year earlier

Al Capone has ruled the violent
Chicago underworld

it wasn't for murder...

27:14.544 --> 27:16.844
Schultz is seen partying
at Manhattan bars

27:16.846 --> 27:19.713
and nightclubs.

27:19.715 --> 27:22.549
(Selwyn Raab) Schultz liked
to be a big shot around town.

27:22.551 --> 27:25.118
What's the deal, eh?
Hey, let's fill it up, huh?

27:25.120 --> 27:27.286
(Selwyn Raab) He was one
of the original owners

27:27.288 --> 27:29.187
of the famous Cotton Club
in Harlem.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.689
So he was a man about town
as well as a man of--

27:31.691 --> 27:33.257
a man about gangsterdom.

27:33.259 --> 27:35.592
Get another bottle of vino
over here for the ladies.

27:35.594 --> 27:37.093
That's all.
Cheers, huh?

27:37.095 --> 27:39.728
We're all here.
We're all here together.

27:39.730 --> 27:42.263
(narrator) Schultz's exploits
start making headlines.

27:45.166 --> 27:48.134
But he manages to stay one step
ahead of Thomas Dewey

27:48.136 --> 27:49.835
and his investigators.

27:54.207 --> 27:56.675
Months pass without an arrest.

27:56.677 --> 27:58.009
(Dewey)
...how much overtime it costs.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.844
I don't care if any of you
get a day off.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.746
I don't care
if you eat or sleep!

28:02.748 --> 28:03.913
Nobody rests!

28:03.915 --> 28:05.415
(phone ringing)

28:05.417 --> 28:06.916
Dewey.

28:09.953 --> 28:12.788
Uh, yes, sir, I hear you
loud and clear.

28:12.790 --> 28:16.224
(narrator) Dewey's inability
to bring Schultz into custody

28:16.226 --> 28:19.327
soon turns from a local
tabloid story

28:19.329 --> 28:21.762
into a national
embarrassment...

28:29.136 --> 28:31.937
(lighter flicks)

28:31.939 --> 28:35.740
...landing on the desk of
the director of the F.B.I.,

28:35.742 --> 28:37.341
J. Edgar Hoover.

28:38.876 --> 28:41.344
Hoover has made his reputation
by taking down

28:41.346 --> 28:45.247
some of the most notorious
criminals in the country.

28:45.249 --> 28:47.249
But he's refused
to let the F.B.I.

28:47.251 --> 28:49.818
investigate organized crime
in New York.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.119
(sighs)

28:51.121 --> 28:52.887
(Selwyn Raab)
For most of his reign,

28:52.889 --> 28:55.756
Hoover totally
ignored the Mafia

28:55.758 --> 28:57.858
and claimed it didn't exist.

28:58.926 --> 29:00.259
But he had reasons

29:00.261 --> 29:02.728
for not tackling the Mafia.

29:07.867 --> 29:09.367
(narrator)
In the 1930s,

29:09.369 --> 29:11.836
nearly all of Hoover's agents
are clean-cut men

29:11.838 --> 29:14.438
from small towns
in middle America.

29:16.174 --> 29:19.976
They had no idea about
the Mafia culture.

29:19.978 --> 29:23.145
There was no way they could
infiltrate the Mafia.

29:23.147 --> 29:25.046
(narrator)
Hoover may also have another,

29:25.048 --> 29:29.917
more personal reason for not
going after the New York Mob.

29:29.919 --> 29:32.486
(Rich Cohen) J. Edgar Hoover never
wanted to take on the Mafia

29:32.488 --> 29:35.255
because the mob
had a file of him

29:35.257 --> 29:37.924
with pictures of him wearing
dresses and garter belts.

29:37.926 --> 29:40.226
That's a theory.

29:40.228 --> 29:42.027
(Edward McDonald)
Could have been extorted.

29:42.029 --> 29:43.461
They could have said, "Look,
we're going to reveal you

29:43.463 --> 29:46.163
as a homosexual,"
something which obviously

29:46.165 --> 29:48.365
is very different
than it is today.

29:48.367 --> 29:51.468
(narrator) Despite the risks,
Hoover decides that his reputation

29:51.470 --> 29:54.137
as a crime fighter
is at stake.

29:54.139 --> 29:56.472
He can longer
let Dutch Schultz

29:56.474 --> 29:58.774
make a mockery
of law enforcement.

30:00.977 --> 30:02.978
For the first time in history,

30:02.980 --> 30:08.049
Hoover names a New York gangster
Public Enemy Number One.

30:13.021 --> 30:16.323

"Don't put a spotlight
on the Mob."

By drawing the attention

You know what you're

You gotta

31:36.057 --> 31:37.556
The best lawyers,
huh?

31:39.992 --> 31:41.625
(scoffs)

31:48.966 --> 31:51.033
All right.

Whatever it costs.

31:59.441 --> 32:00.941

years of successfully eluding

32:07.282 --> 32:09.448

and the F.B.I.,

32:09.450 --> 32:13.652
the most wanted man in America
is turning himself in.

32:13.654 --> 32:15.553
I don't think Lucky Luciano
was a genius.

32:15.555 --> 32:17.321
I think he was
a very bright guy

32:17.323 --> 32:21.525
and the right time
and the right situation.

32:21.527 --> 32:23.927
A Sicilian wiseguy
once told me,

32:23.929 --> 32:25.995
he said, "When you
got them by their balls,

32:25.997 --> 32:28.163
their hearts and minds
will follow."

32:30.332 --> 32:32.299
(narrator)
With Schultz in custody,

32:32.301 --> 32:35.101
Thomas Dewey is now
closer than ever

32:35.103 --> 32:37.002

his first victory

32:37.004 --> 32:39.537
over the New York Mafia.

32:39.539 --> 32:41.272
But what he doesn't know

32:41.274 --> 32:45.242
is that Lucky Luciano
has already put a plan in motion

32:45.244 --> 32:47.944
to make sure
Schultz goes free.

32:47.946 --> 32:49.946
(Oscar Goodman)
In the old days,

32:49.948 --> 32:52.915
when a member of a group
got into trouble,

32:52.917 --> 32:55.984
the group took care of them as
far as a lawyer was concerned.

32:55.986 --> 33:00.421
They didn't go hungry.
They got 'em out on bail.

33:00.423 --> 33:02.423
(narrator)
Days after Schultz surrenders,

33:02.425 --> 33:04.425
he easily posts bail.

33:06.127 --> 33:07.594
And the Mob's lawyers
win a petition

33:07.596 --> 33:10.063
to move his trial

33:10.065 --> 33:12.565
400 miles north...

33:12.567 --> 33:15.134
to Malone, New York.

33:22.241 --> 33:26.244
If the Mafia can't buy off
the biggest city in America,

33:26.246 --> 33:28.279
they'll settle
for something smaller.

arrives in Malone,

he begins spreading money
all over town...

33:38.588 --> 33:40.622
...and hosting parties
for local officials.

33:40.624 --> 33:42.390
Enjoy it!
Enjoy it, enjoy it.

(Schultz)
And it's on me.

33:45.962 --> 33:47.294

People often think

33:47.296 --> 33:49.262
that the way to succeed
in the Mob

33:49.264 --> 33:51.230
is to be feared.

33:51.232 --> 33:52.431
(indistinct chatter)

33:52.433 --> 33:54.065
Certainly that's important.
