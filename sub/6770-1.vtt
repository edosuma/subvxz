00:07.207 --> 00:09.376
Kelly?

00:09.442 --> 00:11.244
What happened?
Are you okay?

00:11.311 --> 00:12.746
He had a knife.

00:12.812 --> 00:14.314
-Are you hurt? Are-Are you hurt?
-He threatened me.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.248

Huh? Were you alone?

00:22.255 --> 00:23.223
All right, all right,
listen to me.

00:23.289 --> 00:26.159
The cops will want to know
what happened, okay?

00:26.226 --> 00:27.460
He locked the door...

00:27.527 --> 00:29.162
All right, that's good.
You tell them that.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.764
But if I tell you
not to answer them,

00:30.830 --> 00:31.765

-Okay.

Turn around.

00:38.338 --> 00:39.072
On the ground.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.340

-Now!

00:40.407 --> 00:42.208
Face down.

00:42.275 --> 00:43.276
Why are they doing this?

00:43.343 --> 00:45.145
My name is Matt Durning;
I'm this woman's attorney.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.246
OFFICER:
Arms at your back.

00:46.312 --> 00:47.247
She's the victim here.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.381
No, he was trying
to kill me.

00:48.448 --> 00:49.382
He said that?

00:49.449 --> 00:51.317
Yes!

00:51.384 --> 00:52.786
No, not now.

01:00.794 --> 01:01.828
-Yes.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.531
Out.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.366
Three entry wounds.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.634
Deceased.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.334
Did you know him?

01:08.401 --> 01:09.803
You shouldn't be arresting her.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.371
Did you?

01:11.438 --> 01:12.505
(handcuffs click)

01:12.572 --> 01:14.340
His name is Joe Patch;
he was my client.

You defended him?

01:15.909 --> 01:16.843
Worse.

I kept him out of jail.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.178
he was in my office,

08:32.245 --> 08:34.714
Said he wanted something
for his girlfriend.

08:34.780 --> 08:38.583

and that's why he was there.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.653

district attorney is coming down

09:34.707 --> 09:37.777

09:37.843 --> 09:39.979
Yeah. I gave it to her.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.647
It wasn't licensed.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.282

with that,

09:43.349 --> 09:44.717
you just send them my way.

09:44.784 --> 09:45.851
With your record,
you'd go right to jail.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.019
They don't realize

09:47.086 --> 09:48.955
that she is the victim here?

09:49.021 --> 09:51.891
What they realize is
that she broke the law.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.360
And I got to get back

09:54.427 --> 09:56.629
Yeah.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.734
STEVE:
<i>Of course what happened</i>

10:01.801 --> 10:03.636
-is horrible.
-Then how can you find anything

10:03.703 --> 10:04.603
good in it?

10:04.670 --> 10:06.372
I didn't say
there was anything good in it.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.674
It's just that convicted rapists
don't get much jail time.

10:08.741 --> 10:09.942

10:10.009 --> 10:11.844

10:11.911 --> 10:13.379
DONNA: But the fact is,
none of this would have happened

10:13.446 --> 10:15.214
if I hadn't left Kelly alone
in the store.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.716
You really think
things would have been

10:16.782 --> 10:17.783
any different
if you were there?

10:17.850 --> 10:21.620
-I left early, and if I had...
-It's ridiculous.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.955
JANET:
Did you tell Noah?

10:23.022 --> 10:24.991
Uh, no, I couldn't reach him.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.928
Well, now's your chance.

10:30.863 --> 10:32.865
Come here.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.005
Let's get out of here.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.709
Donna...

10:43.776 --> 10:45.177
Wait.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.916
Noah?

10:52.051 --> 10:54.720
Would you excuse us
for a second?

10:54.787 --> 10:56.789
Sure.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.024
A second, okay?

10:58.090 --> 10:59.091
Mm.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.698
Anyway, I...
I thought you should know

11:05.765 --> 11:07.700
that Kelly shot someone tonight.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.668
Now, slow down--
what are you talking about?

11:09.735 --> 11:10.770
In the store,
she killed the man

11:10.836 --> 11:12.238
-who raped her.
-Is she okay?

11:12.304 --> 11:13.439
I tried to tell you earlier,

11:13.506 --> 11:15.041
but apparently,
you were a little too busy.

11:15.107 --> 11:16.776
Just relax on that.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.377
It's none of
your business anymore.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.445
Is she okay?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.413
No.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.183
Noah.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.720
I want to talk to my friends
about this, okay?

11:43.836 --> 11:45.971
Any word from Kelly?

11:46.038 --> 11:48.474
-No.
-Oh. Well, I think

11:48.541 --> 11:50.476
I'm gonna go down
to the police station

11:50.543 --> 11:52.478
and see what's up.

11:54.413 --> 11:56.348
(sighs)

11:56.415 --> 11:59.752
You know, David...

11:59.819 --> 12:01.487
about what happened in there

12:01.554 --> 12:02.922
with Gina...

12:02.988 --> 12:04.457
I'm sorry.

12:04.523 --> 12:06.192
It just happened.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.761
You don't just happen
to screw your oldest friend.

12:08.828 --> 12:12.331
You don't just happen
to be selfish; you work at it.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.234
-I said... I was sorry.
-So what, Dylan,

12:15.301 --> 12:17.236
that's supposed to make
what you did okay?

12:17.303 --> 12:18.204
What do you want from me?

12:18.270 --> 12:20.473
I want you to admit
what you did was wrong.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.908
-And I want you to feel badly.
-If it hurt you,

12:22.975 --> 12:24.009
then I do.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.177
You don't even know how.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.412
And you know what,
spare me the whole

12:26.479 --> 12:28.114
"woe is me" routine,
'cause you know what?

12:28.180 --> 12:30.249
I've seen it way
too many times to be moved.

12:30.316 --> 12:33.085
(quietly):
All right.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.320
You should leave her alone.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.791
I can't do it.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.159
I want you to move out.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.460
I'll be in a hotel tonight.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.131
(door slams)

12:45.197 --> 12:47.299
{\an1}KELLY: <i> You make it sound</i>
<i>like I should thank them.</i>

12:47.366 --> 12:49.835
All I said was I'm relieved
they're not filing charges.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.437
Well, why it took them
all night to decide

12:51.504 --> 12:54.140
that what I did was
justifiable is beyond me.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.408
I know. Kelly, what
you've been through is awful.

12:56.475 --> 12:57.510
Believe me, I know.

12:57.576 --> 12:58.978
These people, I mean,

12:59.044 --> 13:00.846
they're just doing
their jobs, that's all...

13:00.913 --> 13:02.815
KELLY:
That sounds like a cop-out.

13:02.882 --> 13:04.450
-Hi.
-Hey, Donna.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.352
Mm, are you okay?

13:06.418 --> 13:07.353
Let's go.

13:07.419 --> 13:08.487
(Kelly sighs)

13:08.554 --> 13:10.489
KELLY:
I was handcuffed last night.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.124
I-I could have died,
and someone

13:12.191 --> 13:13.559
in your department
put handcuffs on me.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.394
Well, I am sorry
for what you've been through.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.931
And I apologize for anything the
department did to make it worse.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.500
Has a decision been made whether
or not a gun charge'll be filed?

13:21.567 --> 13:23.169
No. Not yet.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.071
So I could still go to jail,
for defending myself?

13:26.138 --> 13:29.341
I thought you were supposed
to protect innocent people.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.544
I thought you were
supposed to defend them.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.551
Uh, Detective...

13:38.617 --> 13:39.552
what should I do
about the store?

13:39.618 --> 13:41.554
I mean, it's boarded up
and it's a mess inside.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.855
DETECTIVE:
Well, that's up to you.

13:42.922 --> 13:43.889
Our investigation's over.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.257
Okay, but you guys are gonna

13:45.324 --> 13:46.859
-clean it up, right?
-Well, I could

13:46.926 --> 13:48.561
give you some names
of some companies, but, uh,

13:48.627 --> 13:50.396
it'd be faster
if you did it yourself.

13:50.462 --> 13:51.530
Someone died in there.

13:51.597 --> 13:52.998
DETECTIVE:
There's nothing we can do.

13:53.065 --> 13:54.533
I'm sorry.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.902
(quietly):
Thanks.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.270
(scoffs)

13:58.337 --> 13:59.305
STEVE:
<i>Look, I don't want to go over</i>

13:59.371 --> 14:00.606
<i>this layout</i>
<i>any more than you do,</i>

14:00.673 --> 14:02.308
but we have a paper to put out.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.176
"Stars Who Binge."

14:04.243 --> 14:06.412
"Hermaphrodites in Hollywood"?
You call this a paper?

14:06.478 --> 14:07.580
It's entertainment--
it helps people

14:07.646 --> 14:09.215
take their mind
off their problems.

14:09.281 --> 14:11.584
You know, after what's happened
to Kelly, I'm convinced

14:11.650 --> 14:13.586
-this is a good thing.
-(phone rings)

14:13.652 --> 14:15.554
<i>Beverly Beat.</i>

14:16.589 --> 14:18.324
Speaking.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.326
Oh, um, could you
hold on one second?

14:20.392 --> 14:21.860
Thanks.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.301
Steve, could I have
a little privacy?

14:29.368 --> 14:31.437
Sure, honey.
Who's on the phone?

14:31.503 --> 14:32.905
Uh, no one.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.440
Really. I thought

14:34.506 --> 14:36.609
that we agreed
to get a partition.

14:36.675 --> 14:37.476
-What?
-It's just that we're

14:37.543 --> 14:39.378
always on top
of each other, Steve,

14:39.445 --> 14:40.346
and I really can't stand that.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.615
-Who's on the phone?
-This has nothing to do

14:42.681 --> 14:44.416
with who's on the phone.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.118
This-this is about you and me

14:46.185 --> 14:48.153
and-and being together
all the time.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.388
What are you talking about?

14:49.455 --> 14:51.090
A partition!

14:51.156 --> 14:52.558
A cubicle! Space!

14:52.625 --> 14:54.193
Janet, nobody <i> wants</i> a cubicle.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.294
JANET:
I do.

14:55.361 --> 14:56.595
I-I want a cubicle.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.063
I need a cubicle.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.099
A cubicle would
make me very happy.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.202
Yeah.
(anxious chuckle)

15:03.269 --> 15:05.571
I'm gonna go to The Peach Pit.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.573
When you regain your sanity,

15:07.640 --> 15:10.576
why don't you
come and meet me, okay?

15:10.643 --> 15:12.645
(Steve chuckles)

15:13.545 --> 15:14.947
(door closes)

15:15.014 --> 15:15.981
I'm so sorry about that.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.116
MAN (over phone):
No problem.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.417
Janet, I've gone over
your resume...

15:18.484 --> 15:19.652
Oh, you read my application.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.387
MAN:
Yeah. Are you free tomorrow?

15:21.453 --> 15:22.988
You want me to come
to the <i> Chronicle</i>

15:23.055 --> 15:24.089
for an interview tomorrow?

15:24.156 --> 15:25.658
MAN: We have an opening
in our Living Arts section.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.594
-Living Arts section?
-Yeah, is that a problem?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.596
-N-No, it-it's just...
-Well, how about lunch?

15:30.663 --> 15:33.432
-During lunch.
-Be at my office at noon?

15:33.499 --> 15:35.434
-Okay, I'll be there.
-See you then.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.238
(quietly):
Yes!

15:39.305 --> 15:41.340
DAVID:
<i>Thanks a lot. You, too.</i>

15:41.407 --> 15:44.576
Donna, the company said
they'll be out this afternoon

15:44.643 --> 15:46.178
to measure for new windows.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.113
All right, well,
I got this part.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.515
Tell me we're not doing this.

15:49.581 --> 15:53.252
Donna, why don't you let
me and David finish up.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.354
Why don't you find Kelly,
see how she's doing.

15:55.421 --> 15:56.422
She's with Dylan.

15:56.488 --> 15:58.957
He said he would keep her busy
until we're done.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.493
Well, maybe she's helping him
find a new place to live.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.594
What are you talking about?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.997
-He's moving out.
-Why?

16:05.064 --> 16:06.131
'Cause I told him to.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.233
-Hey, Noah.
-What's up?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.669
You wanted to see me?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.477
Thanks for coming.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.179
I'm having lunch
with Cherise today.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.246
It was on the way.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.483
Listen, I know I have
no right to ask you this,

16:24.550 --> 16:26.552
but... (sighs)

16:26.618 --> 16:28.487
I could really use
someone to talk to

16:28.554 --> 16:30.356
about what happened to Kelly.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.458
I'm freaking out.

16:32.524 --> 16:33.625
I'm concerned
about Kelly, too, okay?

16:33.692 --> 16:36.128
But I don't want
to talk to you right now.

16:37.396 --> 16:39.765
I'm sorry about your store.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.340
Tell me that
I'm not hearing this.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.175
I'm not saying
I did the wrong thing...

16:50.242 --> 16:51.610
You did the right thing.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.613
Did I give him a chance to stop?
Did I warn him?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.448
Would it have made a difference?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.417
I killed someone, Steve. Yeah.

16:58.484 --> 17:01.120
You said the cops made you
feel like a criminal.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.621
Kelly, you're not.

17:04.522 --> 17:05.723
Hi, sweetheart.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.394
-Hi.
-Hey, Janet. Have a seat.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.396
How are you doing?

17:11.463 --> 17:13.132
I'm doing.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.404
Hey, come on,
give her some space, Janet.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.271
(Janet sighs)

17:20.339 --> 17:21.339
Here.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.375
Well, excuse me for being moved.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.077
You're the one from TV, right?

17:25.144 --> 17:27.479
The one that blew that guy away?

17:27.546 --> 17:29.515
Just leave her alone.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.617
I think a chick
defending herself like that

17:31.683 --> 17:33.252
is so cool.

17:36.688 --> 17:38.757
Don't pay any attention
to that, Kel.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.530
DONNA: <i> I just don't get it.</i>
<i>What's her appeal?</i>

17:44.596 --> 17:46.498
Is it the attitude?

17:46.565 --> 17:49.201
This isn't about Gina.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.503
Yeah, but she's the reason
you kicked Dylan out.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.605
Dylan is the reason
I kicked Dylan out.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.542
It's the hair, isn't it?
It's her hair.

17:56.608 --> 17:57.409
Donna...

17:57.476 --> 17:59.511
-she's a friend.
-Okay, see, that's where

17:59.578 --> 18:00.646
it gets confusing for me,

18:00.712 --> 18:03.482
because Dylan's a friend.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.517
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.553
-Dylan's a friend?
-Yeah.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.757
Last night, when you saw
Noah kiss Cherise,

18:11.824 --> 18:14.126
it didn't feel
very good, did it?

18:14.193 --> 18:15.461
Now, imagine walking in

18:15.527 --> 18:17.229
on the two of them
in bed together.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.198
(groans)
Great. Thank you.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.633
Now it'll be impossible
<i>not</i> to picture that.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.136
Ew. What is she like,
Cherise, is she nice?

18:24.203 --> 18:25.504
Cherise has had a crush on Noah

18:25.571 --> 18:27.272
since she started
working at the club.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.509
It's kind of funny
he didn't respond until now.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.610
So what, y-you
think it's nothing?

18:31.677 --> 18:32.878
No.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.514
I'm just saying
he hardly knows her.

18:36.715 --> 18:37.516
So how's Wayne?

18:39.384 --> 18:41.186
Kel.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.795
Oh. Thanks, but
I'm not really hungry.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.764
You have to eat something.

18:52.831 --> 18:54.132
(phone rings)

18:55.734 --> 18:56.702
Hello?

18:56.768 --> 18:58.403
David, it's Janet.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.638
(knocking at door)

18:59.705 --> 19:00.772
Hey.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.541
JANET:
Is everything okay over there?

19:02.608 --> 19:04.610
DAVID:
Yeah, everything's great.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.512
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey. I'm on with Janet.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.580
-Is Steve there?
-Yeah, Steve's right here. He...

19:10.282 --> 19:11.483
JANET:
Can you tell Kelly I called?

19:11.550 --> 19:12.784
Yeah, I'll tell Kelly
you called.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.453
-Thanks.
-All right.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.288
You're a real pal.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.689
(sighs)

19:17.756 --> 19:19.525
-Hi, Janet.
-Hi.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.494
I'm glad you're there; I've...
I've tried everywhere for you.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.363
Look, if this is
about the cubicle

19:24.429 --> 19:25.597
-or the partition--
-I love you.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.200
or... What did you say?

19:28.267 --> 19:30.536
I know that I've been acting
like a real pain lately,

19:30.602 --> 19:33.372
but... I think
that you're terrific.

19:33.438 --> 19:35.674
Look, I've never dated...

19:35.741 --> 19:38.710
Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde
before, so, uh...

19:38.777 --> 19:40.712
it's a little confusing.

19:40.779 --> 19:44.583
Yeah, I don't want to take you
away from Kelly, I just...

19:44.650 --> 19:47.653
I want you to know
that I think you're great.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.222
(beep)

19:50.289 --> 19:51.790
-(dial tone)
-(Steve groans)

19:51.857 --> 19:53.325
(beep)

19:53.392 --> 19:54.693
(chuckles)

19:55.727 --> 19:57.496
DAVID:
So, what's up?

19:57.563 --> 19:59.498
She loves me.

19:59.565 --> 20:03.268
Wow. Sometimes
I don't get you at all.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.305
Yeah.

20:09.741 --> 20:11.376
Hey, you guys mind?
I think Richard Grieco's

20:11.443 --> 20:13.512
-on <i> E! True Hollywood Story.</i>
-Oh, yeah, Booker.

20:13.579 --> 20:14.813
Rock my world.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.248
(laughs)
Really?

20:16.315 --> 20:17.382
(whispers):
Kidding.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.420
The killing took place

20:21.486 --> 20:23.689
at this chic
Beverly Hills boutique.

20:23.755 --> 20:24.790
Hey, why don't
you turn this off?

20:24.856 --> 20:25.791
We don't need to see this.

20:25.857 --> 20:26.825
No, wait.

20:26.892 --> 20:27.893
...on the assailant,

20:27.960 --> 20:30.362
who is co-owner
of Now Wear This.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.563
She apparently responded

20:31.630 --> 20:34.566
by shooting him with a handgun
she had within the store.

20:34.633 --> 20:38.537
If that's true, then...
I don't blame her.

20:38.604 --> 20:39.605
Blame me?

20:39.671 --> 20:41.807
REPORTER: Gina Kincaid is
the suspect's roommate.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.476
Wow, I live with a person
who killed someone.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.411
That does kind of freak me out.

20:46.478 --> 20:47.646
That's enough.
Turn it off.

20:47.713 --> 20:50.515
(door closes)

20:50.582 --> 20:51.717
Oh, hey.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.386
Hey.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.589
What?

20:57.656 --> 20:58.690
We just saw you on TV.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.560
Right.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.428
I can explain that.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.864
Gina, we all agreed that we
weren't gonna talk to anybody.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.667
You know... that reporter,
she came over, she cornered me.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.035
You know the coffee machine

21:10.102 --> 21:12.804
-in the police station?
-I'm going to bed.

21:14.873 --> 21:17.009
K...

21:17.075 --> 21:18.110
(Gina laughs)

21:18.176 --> 21:20.879
It's not like I said
she murdered him or anything.

21:20.946 --> 21:21.913
(groans)

21:23.815 --> 21:26.585
You know what?
Come here.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.787
I want you out of here.

21:28.854 --> 21:31.423
(laughs) Oh, you're jealous
'cause I was on TV.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.524
No. Gina, I want you out

21:32.591 --> 21:35.494
of here-- I want you
to pack your bags and move out.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.297
-Donna, are you serious? I...
-The sooner, the better.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.400
Take your skates with you, okay?

22:01.019 --> 22:04.690
(yawns)

22:04.756 --> 22:06.625
You didn't eat enough.

22:06.692 --> 22:09.528
(sighing):
Yeah, well, Belgian waffles--

22:09.594 --> 22:12.397
you know, they were very popular
when I was in high school,

22:12.464 --> 22:14.733
right up there
with long sideburns

22:14.800 --> 22:17.469
and throwing up
off the top of the building.

22:17.536 --> 22:18.603
I am impressed, though.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.539
You remembered the napkin trick.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.908
It's been a long time
since you were in high school.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.744
In three years here, you managed
to leave quite an impression.

22:25.811 --> 22:26.645
This time around,

22:26.712 --> 22:28.714
I plan on being
a lot lower maintenance.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.115
Well, that won't be difficult.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.451
For one thing, you don't have
to sneak out at night.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.120
But you know I-I paid
to have those cameras fixed.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.089
When I think of the way
your father depended on me...

22:37.155 --> 22:39.458
That was money well spent.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.559
How is he?

22:41.593 --> 22:44.629
Um, he's... he's, he's good.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.131
Say hello to him for me.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.633
I will.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.536
GINA:
Wow.

22:51.603 --> 22:53.605
Hi, sweetie.

22:53.672 --> 22:54.940
-Yeah, hi.
-Hi.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.442
-Hector, this is...
-Hi, I'm Gina.

22:57.509 --> 22:59.678
DYLAN:
Hector manages the hotel.

22:59.745 --> 23:00.746
I love this place.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.714
Mm-hmm.

23:02.781 --> 23:03.815
Just like I remembered it.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.686
Mm-hmm.

23:07.753 --> 23:10.622
(door closes)

23:10.689 --> 23:15.527
Oh, um, I'm sorry that things
didn't go well with David.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.530
Yeah, so am I.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.766
You know what, though?

23:20.832 --> 23:23.769
If I had a place like this
to fall back on...

23:23.835 --> 23:25.437
(Dylan sighs)

23:25.504 --> 23:28.540
...I would've gotten myself
kicked out a long time ago.

23:28.607 --> 23:31.042
Mm-hmm, yeah, well,
I'll tell you, um,

23:31.109 --> 23:33.411
living in a hotel--
i-it gets old really fast.

23:33.478 --> 23:34.479
Oh, yeah.

23:34.546 --> 23:35.580
-Mm-hmm.
-It does.

23:35.647 --> 23:38.617
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

23:38.683 --> 23:42.554
Um... what are you doing?

23:42.621 --> 23:46.892
I am trying to forget
about everything right now.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.861
-Mm-hmm.
-You want to help me?

23:49.928 --> 23:53.098
I do, but I-I got to meet Donna.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.967
-You do?
-At, at the store.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.470
When?

23:58.537 --> 23:59.771
-Now.
-Right now?

23:59.838 --> 24:01.907
-Yeah.
-Can it wait?

24:10.816 --> 24:12.751
(phone rings)

24:12.818 --> 24:14.619
Think I deserve an explanation.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.588
Why don't you have a seat?

24:16.655 --> 24:18.790
Hey, the D.A. does not want
to file a gun charge

24:18.857 --> 24:19.925
against Kelly Taylor.

24:19.991 --> 24:21.660
He knows it's political suicide,

24:21.726 --> 24:23.662
but now he's getting pressure
to file from your department?

24:23.728 --> 24:25.630
-She broke the law.
-Come on now, that's no answer

24:25.697 --> 24:26.665
and you know it.

24:26.731 --> 24:27.566
Well, no, I don't.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.468
Look, your job is
to protect the innocent,

24:30.535 --> 24:33.071
even if it means bending
the rules a little bit.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.241
Gun control helps cops,
takes guns away from criminals,

24:36.308 --> 24:39.578
lowers crime, helps keep the
city safe, and it saves lives.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.880
Well, but she's not a criminal.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.682
I'm not saying she is.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.017
Look, should she have had
an unregistered gun?

24:46.084 --> 24:47.085
No.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.820
Should it have been
illegally purchased for her?

24:48.887 --> 24:51.957
Of course not,
but she's the victim here,

24:52.023 --> 24:54.526
and if she didn't have that gun,
she would have been killed,

24:54.593 --> 24:57.629
which is why what she did was
declared a justifiable homicide.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.831
Justifiable.

24:59.898 --> 25:01.733
It means justice was done.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.736
Why can't you just
leave it at that?

25:09.307 --> 25:10.542
DYLAN:
<i>Hey, Donna, sorry I'm late.</i>

25:10.609 --> 25:11.843
Hey, no problem.

25:11.910 --> 25:12.978
Everything okay?

25:13.044 --> 25:17.148
Yeah, I just, uh, had to go over
a few things with Gina.

25:17.215 --> 25:19.718
What, like what a bitch I am?

25:19.784 --> 25:22.554
Actually, no,
that didn't come up.

25:22.621 --> 25:25.056
Oh, I am not sorry
I kicked her out.

25:25.123 --> 25:26.825
What did you say?

25:26.892 --> 25:30.128
Look, whatever she said
about me, I want to know, okay?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.564
Well, trust me, she,
she showed amazing restraint.

25:32.631 --> 25:36.234
Oh, then I suppose she didn't
review her debut on the news

25:36.301 --> 25:37.636
when she bad-mouthed Kelly.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.037
She did not.

25:39.104 --> 25:40.805
Whatever. I know
you're back together with her,

25:40.872 --> 25:41.873
but she's evil.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.242
(sighs)

25:45.610 --> 25:46.478
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:46.544 --> 25:48.546
I thought you were
with David and Steve.

25:48.613 --> 25:50.649
You guys have done
a lot of work.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.850
Do you really think

25:51.917 --> 25:54.886
this is a good idea--
you being here now?

25:54.953 --> 25:56.755
Must have taken a long time.

25:56.821 --> 26:01.259
Actually, I think we're going
to be finished today.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.762
You know what? How about
we all go to the beach tomorrow?

26:03.828 --> 26:04.930
We can hang out together.

26:04.996 --> 26:06.231
DYLAN:
Now, that sounds good.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.632
DONNA:
Mm-hmm.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.134
DYLAN:
Does that sound good to you?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.937
Yeah, that sounds great.

26:12.003 --> 26:14.973
(Dylan sighs)

26:16.908 --> 26:19.044
(phone rings)

26:19.110 --> 26:21.613
-I got it.
-Must be the printer.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.847
<i>-Beat.</i>
-MAN: Steve Sanders.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.015
-Speaking.
-Steve, um...

26:24.082 --> 26:25.083
(whispering):
It's the <i> Chronicle.</i>

26:25.150 --> 26:26.618
They probably want to syndicate
some of our stuff.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.620
-W-Why don't you just let me...?
-Shh.

26:28.687 --> 26:29.587
MAN: ...recommendation
for Janet Sosna.

26:29.654 --> 26:31.623
A recommendation
for Janet Sosna?

26:31.690 --> 26:32.757
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

26:32.824 --> 26:34.759
Because her interview
went so well.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.761
Well, that's...

26:36.828 --> 26:38.630
(sighs)

26:38.697 --> 26:40.699
You'd be lucky to get her.

26:40.765 --> 26:41.967
Yeah.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.706
I'm sorry, I didn't know
they were going to call here.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.374
Is that why you're sorry--
because they called?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.209
This is something
that I've been thinking about

26:51.276 --> 26:52.777
for a long time.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.379
Clearly.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.047
I'm sorry, okay?

26:56.114 --> 26:58.116
I should have told you.

26:58.183 --> 27:01.286
I've just been really confused.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.287
Yeah.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.621
That makes two of us.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.127
(Steve sighs)

27:15.200 --> 27:17.135
-Allow me.
-(Donna gasps)

27:17.202 --> 27:18.103
-Hi.
-Hey.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.304
What are you doing here?

27:19.371 --> 27:20.638
There's a coffee place I like
next door.

27:20.705 --> 27:21.673
I was just hanging out.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.908
I thought you were starting work
at the bike shop.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.844
Ah, yeah, turns out
I don't start for a week,

27:25.910 --> 27:29.881
but I was thinking maybe we
could, uh, drive up the coast.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.816
-Excuse me? -If we left
first thing, we could, say,

27:31.883 --> 27:34.719
get to Big Sur and back,
no problem.

27:34.786 --> 27:35.787
Big Sur?

27:35.854 --> 27:38.189
Wayne, my friend is going
through hell right now.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.291
Which, I'm sure,
is a major downer.

27:40.358 --> 27:44.229
Okay, um, I'm having my friends
to the beach tomorrow.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.031
I'd really like you to be there.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.198
Sounds great.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.135
It's just for Kelly-- kind of
get her mind off things.

27:50.201 --> 27:51.703
Oh, uh...

27:51.770 --> 27:53.705
-What?
-Well, nothing, it's just

27:53.772 --> 27:55.673
that if I don't hit the road
first thing, you know, we...

27:55.740 --> 27:57.976
No, I-I don't know.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.377
I told you I wanted to have fun.

27:59.444 --> 28:01.279
Oh, well, whatever you do,

28:01.346 --> 28:04.182
don't let my friend's trauma
prevent you from doing that.

28:04.249 --> 28:06.117
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go to the beach,

28:06.184 --> 28:09.187
cheer up your friend,
then come by after?

28:09.254 --> 28:11.923
And then we'll order in,
maybe rent a movie.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.726
(Donna chuckles)

28:14.793 --> 28:15.860
You're kidding me right now.

28:15.927 --> 28:16.961
No, it'll be great.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.730
Kelly needs me.

28:18.797 --> 28:20.732
And when you're done
taking care of her,

28:20.799 --> 28:23.201
we'll put on
a little music, dance...

28:23.268 --> 28:27.806
I'm sorry, I-I think maybe
this was a mistake, okay?

28:29.474 --> 28:31.810
Donna...

28:31.876 --> 28:34.245
(engine starts)

28:34.312 --> 28:35.380
Donna!

28:35.447 --> 28:37.715
Donna, just...

28:44.189 --> 28:46.758
(dance music playing)

28:52.330 --> 28:54.332
Yeah.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.468
You must be lost.

28:56.534 --> 28:57.869
Dylan's office is upstairs.

28:57.936 --> 28:59.104
Yeah, I know where it is.

28:59.170 --> 29:02.040
I'm getting ready
to start my show, so...

29:02.107 --> 29:04.209
I didn't mean to hurt you.

29:04.275 --> 29:05.110
Then sleeping with Dylan
in my house

29:05.176 --> 29:06.111
probably wasn't
the best idea, was it?

29:06.177 --> 29:08.446
Wait a minute, David,
we're friends, remember?

29:08.513 --> 29:11.282
Well, that just takes the sting
right out of it.

29:11.349 --> 29:14.319
David... hey.

29:14.385 --> 29:15.353
What?

29:15.420 --> 29:16.855
I'm sorry.

29:18.857 --> 29:20.225
I got to get back to work.

29:43.214 --> 29:46.518
Hmm. Cherise is really pretty.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.788
-(sighs)
-(music fades)

29:50.855 --> 29:54.459
Live from the After Dark
on KVIB, this is David Silver.

29:54.526 --> 29:57.862
We've got somewhere
between 90 and 100 guys

29:57.929 --> 29:59.063
in the club tonight,

29:59.130 --> 30:02.567
and I'd like
a quick show of hands.

30:02.634 --> 30:06.538
Anybody out there qualify
as the nice guy?

30:06.604 --> 30:07.739
(indistinct chatter)

30:07.805 --> 30:10.475
Come on, you know who I'm
talking about-- the go-to guy,

30:10.542 --> 30:13.578
the best friend.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.446
Don't be shy, come on,
put up your hands,

30:15.513 --> 30:16.948
so I can tell the folks at home.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.150
(indistinct chatter,
laughter)

30:19.217 --> 30:20.952
That's about two-thirds.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.487
Very good, very good, thank you.

30:22.554 --> 30:25.223
Now, listen very carefully.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.424
You guys are losers.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.526
-(crowd groaning)
-That's right.

30:28.593 --> 30:31.095
You're doormats.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.565
You're placeholders
until the right guy comes along.

30:33.631 --> 30:36.201
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

30:36.267 --> 30:38.570
Believe me.

30:38.636 --> 30:40.438
I'm breaking it to you
the easy way.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.440
(murmuring, laughter)

30:43.474 --> 30:45.843
(dance music playing)

30:45.910 --> 30:47.612
(knocking on door)

30:54.285 --> 30:56.554
-Hi.
-Hey.

30:56.621 --> 30:59.991
So I, uh, I just got
off the phone with the D.A.,

31:00.058 --> 31:02.560
and he will not be filing
a gun charge.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.429
Well, I thought you said
that they were insistent.

31:04.495 --> 31:08.399
Well... apparently,
they changed their minds.

31:08.466 --> 31:11.069
Good. Thank you.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.974
Um, you know,
I think we should go somewhere--

31:16.040 --> 31:19.444
Caribbean, Mexico--

31:19.510 --> 31:21.479
somewhere far away
and for a long time.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.481
(chuckles)
That would be nice.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.216
Just sit around, do nothing.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.551
Then, when we come back,

31:26.618 --> 31:30.321
you'll be able to put all this
behind you.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.322
Even my part in it.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.291
You were just doing your job.

31:33.358 --> 31:34.292
I know that.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.461
That I kept him out of jail?

31:36.527 --> 31:37.595
It wasn't your fault.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.264
I wish you believed that.

31:39.330 --> 31:40.265
I do.

31:40.331 --> 31:42.066
Not yours or mine.

31:42.133 --> 31:45.536
I mean, I feel really terrible
about what I did,

31:45.603 --> 31:47.538
but I know
that I didn't have a choice

31:47.605 --> 31:50.108
and now I just have
to put it behind me.

31:53.344 --> 31:54.679
(gunshots)

31:58.383 --> 32:00.318
(gun hammer clicking,
no bullets firing)

32:00.385 --> 32:02.987
Kelly, broom-- where,
uh, where do I get it?

32:03.054 --> 32:04.222
(whispers):
Uh, over there.

32:10.061 --> 32:11.429
-What happened?
-I pretended

32:11.496 --> 32:12.530
like it was over.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.666
It is.

32:14.732 --> 32:16.467
It's not.

32:16.534 --> 32:18.236
It's not over.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.188
Hey.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.389
You're up early.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.626
Yeah, I, uh, thought
I'd go downstairs

32:41.693 --> 32:42.827
and get something to eat.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.330
Going to the beach today;
we're going to hang with Kelly.

32:45.396 --> 32:46.564
Who's "we"?

32:46.631 --> 32:48.399
(sighs)

32:48.466 --> 32:51.135
You are welcome to come,
if you want.

32:51.202 --> 32:53.171
Oh, yeah, well,

32:53.237 --> 32:55.606
I think my invitation
probably got lost in the mail.

32:55.673 --> 32:58.443
I am inviting you right now.

32:58.509 --> 33:00.578
It's probably better
if I don't go.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.046
Why is that?

33:02.113 --> 33:04.015
'Cause Donna kicked you out?

33:04.082 --> 33:06.150
Why didn't
you tell me about it?

33:06.217 --> 33:07.552
I just assumed if you knew

33:07.618 --> 33:08.720
that I didn't
have a place to live,

33:08.786 --> 33:11.522
then you'd feel obligated
to ask me to stay here with you.

33:11.589 --> 33:13.524
I don't.

33:13.591 --> 33:15.626
Good, because everything's...

33:15.693 --> 33:18.629
going so... well
between us right now.

33:18.696 --> 33:21.666
I don't want to mess that up
with my living situation.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.641
I won't be long.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.781
Um...

33:36.848 --> 33:40.118
you-you know that-that Donna
and Kelly are my friends.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.753
I do know that.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.456
What, you want me
to let them walk all over me

33:45.523 --> 33:47.625
because they're
your little friends?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.127
No.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.496
But you could try to get along.

33:51.562 --> 33:52.597
Is that important to you?

33:52.663 --> 33:54.065
Yeah.

33:54.132 --> 33:57.301
Then I will try.

34:03.608 --> 34:05.610
(knocking on door)

34:06.577 --> 34:07.645
Hi.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.714
Hi. Can I come in?

34:09.781 --> 34:11.815
Yeah. Come.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.456
I'm sorry
about the last couple of days.

34:19.524 --> 34:21.492
I know I've been
all over the place.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.661
Well, with what's happened
to Kelly,

34:23.728 --> 34:25.530
I think we're all a little off.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.732
I didn't get the job.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.434
I'm sorry to hear that.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.802
I know how much you wanted it.

34:30.868 --> 34:32.503
Oh, I shouldn't have
come around.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.505
Hey! Hey!

34:34.572 --> 34:36.507
Come on.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.177
You're a great reporter.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.844
You're gonna get a great job.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.813
I know.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.283
This isn't about work.

34:45.349 --> 34:46.184
Is it about Kelly?

34:46.250 --> 34:48.186
No. This is about us.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.320
Us?

34:54.225 --> 34:56.793
Well...

34:56.860 --> 34:59.630
when you called me
at the beach house,

34:59.697 --> 35:02.166
you said...

35:02.233 --> 35:04.235
we were great.

35:08.339 --> 35:10.675
<i>You</i> were great--
that's what I said.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.545
You also said you loved me.

35:14.612 --> 35:15.613
(sniffles)

35:15.680 --> 35:17.582
(crying):
And I do.

35:17.648 --> 35:20.518
Janet, if you came over here
to make me less confused,

35:20.585 --> 35:24.188
you're not doing
a real good job.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.691
And I guess I just better
make things really clear.

35:28.559 --> 35:29.727
I don't know if this...

35:29.794 --> 35:31.229
(sniffles)

35:31.295 --> 35:34.665
...you and me--
I don't know if it's working.

35:40.738 --> 35:42.273
(David laughs)

35:42.340 --> 35:44.275
He did not use
the word "downer."

35:44.342 --> 35:45.543
<i>"Major</i> downer."

35:45.610 --> 35:47.245
"Major downer"--
to describe Kelly.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.513
I thought he was kidding.

35:48.579 --> 35:50.448
I don't know. You know...

35:50.515 --> 35:52.550
I think we should stay in
tonight... Donna.

35:52.617 --> 35:53.651
You know, we should rent

35:53.718 --> 35:55.152
-a movie or something.
-Stop.

35:55.219 --> 35:56.354
No, really. You know,
we'll listen to a little

35:56.420 --> 35:58.189
Ricky Martin,
we'll live <i> la vida loca.</i>

35:58.256 --> 35:59.824
What was I thinking?

35:59.891 --> 36:00.691
You weren't thinking, okay?

36:00.758 --> 36:02.193
It's... the whole...
it was a fling.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.661
Nothing wrong with that.

36:03.728 --> 36:07.331
Except it cost me my entire
relationship with Noah.

36:07.398 --> 36:08.633
What's going on here?

36:08.699 --> 36:10.501
This looks pretty festive
down here.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.503
What's up?

36:12.570 --> 36:13.671
Hey, what's up, man?

36:13.738 --> 36:14.672
You need help?

36:14.739 --> 36:17.475
Yeah. You know, I got some stuff
up in the truck,

36:17.542 --> 36:18.643
you want to grab it.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.411
-Okay.
-Anything else?

36:20.478 --> 36:21.579
Thanks, Matt.

36:21.646 --> 36:24.348
David.

36:24.415 --> 36:26.217
(sighs)

36:26.284 --> 36:28.352
Hey, where is everybody?

36:28.419 --> 36:29.720
DONNA:
Hey.

36:29.787 --> 36:31.289
Hey.
Matt's being a standup guy

36:31.355 --> 36:33.491
and grabbing some stuff
out of the truck.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.625
Where's Kelly?

36:34.692 --> 36:36.327
She said she'd meet us here.

36:36.394 --> 36:37.595
How's she doing?

36:37.662 --> 36:38.896
Um, I don't know.

36:38.963 --> 36:42.366
She said she needed to be alone
for a little while this morning.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.335
Steve, where's Janet?

36:44.402 --> 36:46.537
Janet, uh...
she had to get the paper out.

36:46.604 --> 36:50.441
She said she'd meet up with us,
though, as soon as she could.

36:56.814 --> 36:59.684
Janet. Hi.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.552
Hi.

37:01.619 --> 37:05.823
I'm undercover for a, uh, story
on stars who binge.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.725
I hear Charlie Sheen
just really loves

37:07.792 --> 37:08.893
Nat's cinnamon French toast.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.294
Really?

37:10.361 --> 37:11.529
Mm-hmm.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.598
I know. It's pathetic.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.833
This story, my job, my life--

37:15.900 --> 37:19.303
it's not at all
like I thought it would be.

37:19.370 --> 37:20.471
(Janet laughs)

37:20.538 --> 37:21.772
Could I be a bigger whiner?

37:21.839 --> 37:23.474
(Janet sniffles)

37:23.541 --> 37:26.477
Well, everyone's life starts out
one way and ends up another.

37:26.544 --> 37:29.380
I get the pleasure of knowing
where it is exactly that my life

37:29.447 --> 37:32.583
changed, and that is in an alley
on Hollywood Boulevard.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.819
How do you deal with that?

37:34.885 --> 37:36.487
Knowing the moment?

37:36.554 --> 37:38.589
I don't know.

37:38.656 --> 37:41.626
Guess you just do.

37:43.794 --> 37:45.029
I'm pregnant.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.764
What?

37:47.798 --> 37:49.000
(both laugh)

37:49.066 --> 37:52.003
Well, I'm happy for you.

37:52.069 --> 37:54.005
Yeah. Yeah, that's my moment.

37:54.071 --> 37:57.675
You know, the one
that's changed my life around.

37:57.742 --> 38:01.379
Yeah. Yours and Steve's.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.680
Except I haven't told him.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.482
Did you just find out?

38:04.548 --> 38:06.484
I just have this history

38:06.550 --> 38:09.954
of terrible pregnancies and-and
miscarriage in my family,

38:10.021 --> 38:13.624
and I wanted to make sure
it was real first, you know?

38:13.691 --> 38:16.494
Janet, how, um...
how pregnant are you?

38:17.728 --> 38:19.664
-Four months.
-Four months.

38:19.730 --> 38:24.669
So, you're having a baby,
no matter what Steve wants.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.671
I keep sizing him up.

38:26.737 --> 38:29.006
You know...

38:29.073 --> 38:32.543
(crying):
...is he gonna be a good dad?

38:32.610 --> 38:34.645
Do I want him to be the dad?

38:34.712 --> 38:37.882
And no one can live up
to that type of scrutiny.

38:37.948 --> 38:39.650
I almost feel sorry for him.

38:39.717 --> 38:40.751
(Janet sniffles)

38:40.818 --> 38:42.620
But every time
I want to tell him,

38:42.687 --> 38:44.555
he just does something
incredibly childish,

38:44.622 --> 38:46.824
and I just... I just run away,
you know?

38:46.891 --> 38:47.992
(sniffles)

38:48.059 --> 38:49.527
I think he's gonna be fine.

38:49.593 --> 38:52.396
-You do?
-Yeah.

38:52.463 --> 38:54.398
(Janet laughs)

38:54.465 --> 38:55.533
Let's go somewhere.

38:55.599 --> 38:56.834
Let's celebrate.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.569
Yeah, I would really like to.

38:58.636 --> 39:00.871
Just... some other time, okay?

39:02.073 --> 39:04.608
You're the first person
I've told.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.610
How does it feel?

39:06.677 --> 39:08.045
It feels real.

39:08.112 --> 39:10.114
Like I'm actually
gonna be a mom.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.618
(laughs)

39:17.054 --> 39:19.890
When did Kelly say
she was gonna get here?

39:19.957 --> 39:21.459
She just said later.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.461
She tell you where she's going?

39:24.595 --> 39:27.431
Just asking.

39:27.498 --> 39:29.900
Tell you what--
I'll-I'll go look for her.

39:29.967 --> 39:32.403
Why don't we pack up
and we'll all go?

39:41.779 --> 39:44.982
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.917
I'm just really worried
about her.

39:46.984 --> 39:48.652
Yeah, I know.

39:48.719 --> 39:49.920
We all are.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.959
Well, look who decided to show.

40:23.020 --> 40:25.022
♪ ♪

40:32.696 --> 40:34.698
(laughter)

40:35.699 --> 40:38.002
Frogs aren't interesting?

40:38.068 --> 40:40.037
(David laughs)

40:43.140 --> 40:46.844
(indistinct laughter,
conversation)

41:05.729 --> 41:07.832
I saw Janet today.

41:07.898 --> 41:09.700
Oh, yeah?

41:09.767 --> 41:12.870
So you know she wants
to break up with me then, huh?

41:12.937 --> 41:15.139
I think
you guys will work it out.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.609
You think so?

41:18.676 --> 41:19.677
Yeah.

41:19.743 --> 41:21.712
No matter what, I predict

41:21.779 --> 41:24.248
this is gonna be
a really great year for you.

41:39.730 --> 41:40.998
(laughter)

41:41.065 --> 41:42.700
You guys ready to get going?

41:42.766 --> 41:45.236
Oh, let's-let's stay.

41:45.302 --> 41:47.872
Whatever you want to do, Kelly.

41:47.938 --> 41:51.542
I want to stay just like this
for as long as we can.
