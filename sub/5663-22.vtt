for the death of his wife.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.652
I think you're responsible

07:21.691 --> 07:24.652
for her death.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.907
I'm looking past

07:24.694 --> 07:28.907
that because I want

07:24.694 --> 07:28.907
Alexander Kirk's head.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.450
And so does Tom Keen.

07:34.621 --> 07:38.041
I must admit,

07:34.621 --> 07:38.041
I've never liked you, Scottie.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.211
Looking at you

07:38.083 --> 07:41.211
makes my toes curl.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.088
But robbing the

07:41.253 --> 07:43.088
next president

07:43.130 --> 07:44.464
of the United States?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.468
This is gonna be a gas.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.273
SCOTTIE: Rubber baby

07:59.562 --> 08:01.273

08:05.277 --> 08:07.279

08:07.321 --> 08:08.780
How did you get in here?

08:08.822 --> 08:12.117
With the seven-figure donation

08:08.822 --> 08:12.117
that built this wing.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.744
(CHUCKLES)

08:14.786 --> 08:17.164
The grasp of

08:14.786 --> 08:17.164
these tiny fingers?

08:17.705 --> 08:19.749
I'd forgotten.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.626
I understand

08:19.791 --> 08:21.626
we're going to be

08:19.791 --> 08:21.626
working together

08:21.668 --> 08:23.420
to find the man

08:21.668 --> 08:23.420
who took Elizabeth from you.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.380
You took her from me.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.380
No.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.341
Alexander Kirk did.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.633
He's why I'm here,

08:27.382 --> 08:28.633
to tell you

08:28.675 --> 08:30.677
I'm putting the full resources

08:28.675 --> 08:30.677
of my company

08:30.718 --> 08:34.097
behind the effort

08:30.718 --> 08:34.097
to find Kirk

08:30.718 --> 08:34.097
and bring him to justice.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.390
Give me my little girl.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.600
She is all

08:36.266 --> 08:37.600
I care about.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.483
I remember my little one,

08:44.524 --> 08:45.566
looking up at me,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.528
eyes full of wonder.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.076
They say losing

08:52.866 --> 08:55.076
a child is something

08:55.118 --> 08:56.995
one never recovers from.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.837
I hope

09:03.043 --> 09:05.837
you never experience

09:03.043 --> 09:05.837
that kind of loss.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.883
For the moment,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.883
we have a common enemy,

09:12.052 --> 09:13.345
so I will work with you.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.267
You have a lovely child.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.563
Ten minutes.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.482
I'll send Solomon

09:23.604 --> 09:25.482
to pick you up.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.401
Got a lot of work to do.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.290
Hope you're a chocoholic,

09:40.288 --> 09:42.290
my friend.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.791
We're going to

09:42.332 --> 09:43.791
the chocolate factory.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.836
Let me say one thing.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.836
I am not your friend.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.677
TOM: <i> What the hell</i>

09:53.218 --> 09:54.677

MR. SOLOMON:

09:54.719 --> 09:55.887

09:54.719 --> 09:55.887

09:55.929 --> 09:58.181

09:55.929 --> 09:58.181

09:58.223 --> 09:59.766
You are 150 feet

09:58.223 --> 09:59.766
below the largest

09:59.807 --> 10:01.893

10:01.935 --> 10:05.188
Complete with R&amp;D labs,

10:01.935 --> 10:05.188

10:01.935 --> 10:05.188
and two airfields.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.774

10:05.230 --> 10:07.774

10:05.230 --> 10:07.774

10:07.815 --> 10:09.192
And those are

10:07.815 --> 10:09.192
just the services

10:09.234 --> 10:10.985

10:09.234 --> 10:10.985

10:11.027 --> 10:12.612

10:12.653 --> 10:14.197

10:14.239 --> 10:16.032
there's Grey Matters.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.209
(WHIRRING)

10:32.424 --> 10:35.594
Grey Matters handles

10:32.424 --> 10:35.594
the cases that are

10:32.424 --> 10:35.594
legally questionable,

10:35.635 --> 10:38.138
yet morally justifiable.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.557
You're late.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.557
She's not happy.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.683
Promise you won't

10:40.599 --> 10:42.683
kick my ass.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.103

10:42.725 --> 10:45.103
kick my ass.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.443
I'm sorry, I can't.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.777
I thought I could,

10:51.485 --> 10:52.777
but I can't.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.446
Remember, we're doing this

10:52.819 --> 10:54.446
for Elizabeth.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.197
Yeah, they're the same people

10:54.488 --> 10:56.197
who killed her.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.574
You.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.660
Hey, if I can do this,

10:57.616 --> 11:00.660
so can you.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.663
Enough. We're on a clock.

(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH)

11:09.419 --> 11:11.630
I don't need your protection.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.299

11:11.671 --> 11:14.299

11:14.341 --> 11:17.676

11:14.341 --> 11:17.676
We've got a confirmed

11:14.341 --> 11:17.676
location on the child.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.180
I want this done today.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.474
The way to get

11:20.221 --> 11:22.474
Kirk's attention

11:20.221 --> 11:22.474
is through his money,

11:22.516 --> 11:23.808
and the only

11:22.516 --> 11:23.808
money we can get to

11:23.850 --> 11:25.560
is sitting in

11:23.850 --> 11:25.560
Diaz's war chest,

11:25.602 --> 11:28.522
which is unfortunate

11:25.602 --> 11:28.522
for the bloviating

11:25.602 --> 11:28.522
senator from Missouri,

11:28.563 --> 11:30.982
because he cannot

11:28.563 --> 11:30.982
win the election

11:28.563 --> 11:30.982
without it,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.900
and we are

11:31.024 --> 11:32.900
going to steal it.

The Bureau

11:32.942 --> 11:35.529

Senator Diaz's

11:35.570 --> 11:37.656
success in November

11:37.696 --> 11:40.158
rests on winning

11:37.696 --> 11:40.158

To do that,

11:47.123 --> 11:50.418
until election day.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.921
The money is

11:50.460 --> 11:53.921
wired to media outlets

11:50.460 --> 11:53.921
via a secure terminal,

11:53.963 --> 11:57.925
from a single account

11:53.963 --> 11:57.925

12:02.430 --> 12:05.642
The good news is,

12:02.430 --> 12:05.642
we can take the bank in

12:02.430 --> 12:05.642
under two minutes.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.519
The bad news is,

12:05.684 --> 12:07.519
the second we walk in,

12:07.561 --> 12:09.354
any teller can

12:07.561 --> 12:09.354
trip a silent alarm

12:09.396 --> 12:10.897
that'll lock down

12:09.396 --> 12:10.897
the area of the bank

12:10.938 --> 12:13.316
where the secure

12:10.938 --> 12:13.316
terminal is located.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.902
So, we won't be

12:13.358 --> 12:15.902
able to access it

12:15.943 --> 12:17.111
before the police arrive.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.322
That's it?

12:19.364 --> 12:20.657
Your plan is awful.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.033
It's brilliant.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.868
The robbery is a show.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.868
You want the police to arrive.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.787
Followed by the FBI.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.787
The heist gets you in.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.540
Gives you time

12:26.829 --> 12:28.540
to access the terminal.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.124
We rob the bank

12:28.582 --> 12:30.124
while everyone

12:28.582 --> 12:30.124
else thinks

12:30.166 --> 12:31.750
that we're trying

12:30.166 --> 12:31.750
to find the robbers.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.504
