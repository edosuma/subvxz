02:04.410 --> 02:07.141
Well, Mrs Linden,
and how do you find England?

02:07.250 --> 02:09.696
Like France. There are cows in the field.

02:09.810 --> 02:11.255
And sheep in the meadows.

02:11.370 --> 02:13.110
Who is Meadows?

02:16.170 --> 02:17.581
Oh, Paul, you are terrible!

02:17.690 --> 02:20.261
People will expect
confetti to fly out of my hair.

02:20.370 --> 02:21.860
Oh, of course.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.337
Most undignified
for an old married couple, isn't it?

02:24.450 --> 02:27.260
Well, five days is long enough to...

02:28.090 --> 02:31.333
- To cool down?
- Paul, don't be vulgar!

02:31.450 --> 02:33.657
And don't dare cool down.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.010
Tickets, please.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.977
How long should we be?

02:42.090 --> 02:44.331
London in 20 minutes.

02:44.450 --> 02:45.497
Oh.

02:50.650 --> 02:52.095
Are you worried about something?

02:52.210 --> 02:53.939
I'm just wondering.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.257
About Jennifer?

02:56.370 --> 02:58.611
I want to love everything that is yours.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.210
Your work, the houses you build,

03:01.330 --> 03:03.173
the cities you plan.

03:03.290 --> 03:06.100
But most of all
I want to love your daughter.

03:07.130 --> 03:09.610
Do you think Jennifer will like me?

03:09.730 --> 03:11.459
How can she help it?

03:11.610 --> 03:17.060
Well, a stepmother, an intruder,
it is not so easy for her.

03:17.170 --> 03:19.298
Nor, perhaps, for you either.

03:19.410 --> 03:24.576
Nichole, I'll be perfectly frank with you.
I find Jennifer a puzzle.

03:24.690 --> 03:26.579
A puzzle? How do you mean?

03:26.690 --> 03:28.772
Well, I don't understand her anymore.

03:28.890 --> 03:30.972
When she was a baby
we were such good friends,

03:31.090 --> 03:32.615
but now we...

03:32.730 --> 03:35.700
- Well, she's not a baby anymore.
- Well, she's only 16.

03:35.810 --> 03:39.940
She needs the understanding
and affection of another woman.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.451
Well, I'm sure
you'll be wonderful for her.

03:42.610 --> 03:44.055
She'll absolutely adore you.

03:44.770 --> 03:48.331
Oh, Paul, I am a lucky woman, so lucky.

03:48.450 --> 03:52.580
All at once I have
a husband, a family, a home.

04:07.690 --> 04:09.772
Here we are, sweetheart, your new home.

04:09.890 --> 04:12.621
Oh, darling! How nice.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.660
I'm glad you like it.

04:22.770 --> 04:24.977
It's been waiting for you
since the day I built it.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.332
Six and six, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.

04:29.450 --> 04:31.339
You know, your house is like you.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.020
How do you mean? Austere?

04:34.130 --> 04:36.417
With a twinkle behind the façade.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.060
Come and meet your new family.

04:43.570 --> 04:45.174
Thank you, sir.

04:45.290 --> 04:46.291
Thank you.

04:53.970 --> 04:56.371
- Well, hello, Martha.
- Oh, Mr Linden.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.015
Welcome back.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.655
And this is Mrs Linden.

05:00.810 --> 05:04.417
Oh, Mrs Linden, ma'am. Welcome home.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.653
I should kiss you for that.
You see? I am very French.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.740
Oh, Mrs Linden, ma'am,
you are most welcome.

05:11.330 --> 05:14.698
- But where's Jennifer?
- Oh, she was just getting dressed, sir.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.414
Yes, I can hear that.

05:16.570 --> 05:18.572
Jennifer?

05:18.690 --> 05:20.658
She must have heard us come in.

05:20.770 --> 05:21.931
Jenny?

05:22.050 --> 05:26.260
She's probably shy of meeting me,
thinking I am some sort of dragon.

05:27.290 --> 05:28.940
Then she's got a big shock coming.

05:29.050 --> 05:30.700
I'll go and fetch her.

05:38.570 --> 05:40.096
Jenny...

05:46.170 --> 05:47.615
Hello, Jenny, darling.

05:50.130 --> 05:51.973
You look wonderful.

05:52.090 --> 05:55.333
Three months,
the longest I've ever been away.

05:55.450 --> 05:58.135
- Seemed like years.
- Yes, it did.

05:59.410 --> 06:01.412
Well... how's the art school?

06:02.210 --> 06:04.656
- It's school.
- Studies going well?

06:04.770 --> 06:05.771
Fine.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.459
Congratulations on your marriage.

06:09.810 --> 06:12.017
Thank you, Jenny. Come and meet her.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.221
Admire my taste?

06:19.570 --> 06:22.460
Perhaps now the house won't
seem so... What was the word?

06:22.610 --> 06:23.611
Dreary.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.937
Dreary, yes.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.132
Perhaps now it will seem more fun for you.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.615
Hm?

06:29.730 --> 06:31.141
Do you think so, Jennifer?

06:35.810 --> 06:37.574
Nichole, this is Jennifer.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.692
I am so happy
to see you at last, Jennifer.

06:39.810 --> 06:40.811
Hello.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.171
I am sure you two
will have a lot in common.

06:43.290 --> 06:45.452
I hope we have everything
in common, Jennifer.

06:45.610 --> 06:47.931
Everything? That's a lot, isn't it?

06:48.050 --> 06:50.417
Oh, what I mean is,
you won't be so lonely any more.

06:50.570 --> 06:52.220
- How does that sound?
- Fine.

06:52.330 --> 06:53.934
When would you like dinner, sir?

06:54.050 --> 06:57.577
Oh, from now on you'll have to ask
Mrs Linden questions like that, Martha.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.896
What do you think, Jennifer?
In half an hour?

07:01.010 --> 07:02.057
That's OK.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.616
- Would that you be all right for you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

07:07.730 --> 07:09.937
Well, what about a drink?

07:10.050 --> 07:13.259
There's ice in the sitting room
and I put out the champagne.

07:13.370 --> 07:16.453
Wonderful idea. See?
I told you, she thinks of everything.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.295
After all, it's a special occasion.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.777
Oh, Martha, you are making me
feel really at home.

07:21.890 --> 07:23.460
How about your having a glass, Martha?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.295
Oh, not if you want any dinner!

07:28.210 --> 07:29.211
Come on, darling.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.732
Well? What do you think of it?

07:50.850 --> 07:53.979
It's wonderful, very impressive.

07:56.850 --> 07:58.261
This is the living room.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.859
- Living room?
- Ah, but it hasn't been lived in yet.

08:02.970 --> 08:04.381
It needs the feminine touch.

08:06.890 --> 08:08.779
We call it organised disorder.

08:09.290 --> 08:11.352
Yes, it would help.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.172
- Don't you think, Jennifer?
- Maybe.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.691
Well, you've made a good start.

08:22.810 --> 08:25.734
Looks human. I like it.

08:25.850 --> 08:28.091
I only use this place for the hi-fi.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.416
It's a morgue.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.618
We'll soon deal with that between us.

08:32.690 --> 08:35.614
- Champagne?
- I don't drink. I'm too young.

08:35.730 --> 08:37.971
16? Of course you're not.

08:38.090 --> 08:39.136
Is she, Paul?

08:39.250 --> 08:40.695
Well...

08:40.809 --> 08:42.221
as Martha says,

08:43.570 --> 08:45.698
it is a special occasion.

08:45.810 --> 08:47.380
Very special.

08:47.490 --> 08:49.015
There you are, Jenny.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.658
To us, all three of us.

08:52.770 --> 08:53.771
To us.

09:01.010 --> 09:02.774
What are you reading, Jennifer?

09:03.690 --> 09:06.170
It's all about jazz, not your stuff.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.338
But it is. Let me see.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.251
Let's look at it.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.213
This is all double Dutch to me.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.172
"Blue Blues & Dixie" by Buller Montgomery.

09:29.290 --> 09:32.055
Oh, I know him.
He was the father of it all.

09:37.810 --> 09:41.292
But who is this? She's beautiful.

09:41.850 --> 09:43.011
Hm?

09:45.330 --> 09:46.980
Where did you get this from?

09:47.930 --> 09:49.580
What are you trying to do?

09:50.770 --> 09:53.011
- It's a picture of...
- It's my mother.

09:53.130 --> 09:56.816
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- I suppose so. I don't remember her.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.854
That is where you get your looks from.

09:59.970 --> 10:01.620
Not from this monster.

10:05.490 --> 10:08.494
- Jennifer, why can't you sit up properly?
- I like floors.

10:10.290 --> 10:12.611
You know, I think Martha's
really quite taken to you.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.732
- Don't you, Jenny?
- I suppose so.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.852
Hadn't thought about it.

10:16.970 --> 10:19.814
- What is the name of your school?
- Saint Martin's.

10:19.930 --> 10:22.695
- One of the best, isn't it?
- Rumour has it.

10:22.810 --> 10:24.812
Jenny's always had a talent
for illustration.

10:24.930 --> 10:27.297
She really draws very well indeed.

10:27.410 --> 10:31.301
It must be fun, doing something
you like and are good at.

10:31.410 --> 10:32.855
Fills in the time.

10:35.410 --> 10:39.051
Darling, what is
in that huge box over there?

10:39.170 --> 10:41.571
- A body?
- That's just about it.

10:41.690 --> 10:43.738
Only that's more like
a skeleton in the cupboard.

10:44.050 --> 10:47.611
It's my toy, and Jennifer's jealous of it.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.495
Jealous? Of a stupid city?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.971
- A city?
- Super mad stuff.

10:53.090 --> 10:56.219
- And then some.
- What are you both talking about?

10:56.330 --> 10:59.652
Well, now, you wouldn't say
I was exactly old-fashioned, would you?

11:00.450 --> 11:04.171
- But Jennifer thinks I'm too modern.
- Strictly as an architect.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.657
In every other sense, a square.

11:07.210 --> 11:08.291
A square?

11:09.450 --> 11:11.578
A little while ago, I was a creep.

11:11.690 --> 11:14.341
- Show me the city, please.
- You'll be sorry.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.417
She may be right, you know.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.618
If I get my city out,
you'll be up till dawn.

11:21.610 --> 11:25.740
It's my life's work. It's meant more to me
than anything in the world.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.420
Hasn't it, Jenny?

11:27.570 --> 11:29.698
Yes, that's true.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.615
Come, I'll show it to you.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.652
- But what is it?
- Ah.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.379
It's a model. I call it City 2000.

11:55.970 --> 11:58.098
Grime, filth, poverty,
noise, hustle and bustle,

11:58.210 --> 12:00.178
these things will be unknown.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.258
An almost silent place,

12:02.370 --> 12:06.659
soundproofed with the use
of flying, bevelled walls of concrete,

12:06.770 --> 12:08.454
which also serve to cut wind and rain.

12:09.850 --> 12:12.581
Jennifer says it will be
like living in a tin can, but...

12:15.770 --> 12:17.454
I don't think that's really true.

12:17.610 --> 12:20.932
You know, psychologists think
that most human neuroses

12:21.050 --> 12:23.781
come from too much contact
with other humans.

12:23.890 --> 12:26.496
- In my city, a man can be as alone...
- Darling...

12:26.650 --> 12:29.096
...as if he were 10,000 miles
from anywhere in the country.

12:29.210 --> 12:30.780
- Paul.
- Hm?

12:30.890 --> 12:34.099
- I'd like to see Jennifer to bed.
- Oh, she can put herself to bed.

12:34.210 --> 12:37.771
I'll be right back.
I want to know every street by heart.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.494
All right, darling. Don't be long.

12:48.490 --> 12:49.651
What is it?

12:53.210 --> 12:54.974
I came to say good night.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.091
Good night.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.058
- You've been crying.
- Crying?

13:00.170 --> 13:01.820
I should think not.

13:01.930 --> 13:03.341
Jennifer, what is it?

13:04.130 --> 13:06.610
Why have you taken such a dislike to me?

13:06.730 --> 13:09.381
I'm not to blame
for your father's divorce.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.379
It was long before he ever met me.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.413
I didn't say I didn't like you.

13:13.570 --> 13:15.140
Don't be childish.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.251
Why not?

13:18.650 --> 13:21.460
- I am a child.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

13:21.610 --> 13:25.251
Your father calls
your behaviour deplorable.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.259
I prefer to think you're just upset.

13:27.810 --> 13:30.893
Naturally I'm upset.
All young girls are upset

13:31.010 --> 13:32.853
when their father brings home a new wife.

13:34.370 --> 13:36.338
Now, if you don't mind, I...

13:36.450 --> 13:37.292
Jennifer.

13:40.850 --> 13:43.740
A juvenile delinquent's first vice.

13:43.850 --> 13:46.774
Other adult vices, sex and the like,
are disapproved of.

13:48.050 --> 13:50.337
Or perhaps you even disapprove of this.

13:50.450 --> 13:52.612
I started smoking when I was 14.

13:54.210 --> 13:57.373
Jennifer, I could not help
falling in love with your father.

13:58.290 --> 13:59.451
Love!

14:00.570 --> 14:03.938
That's the gimmick that
makes sex respectable, isn't it?

14:04.050 --> 14:05.814
I've brought you some things from Paris.

14:05.930 --> 14:08.774
- Dresses and...
- We don't wear dresses very often.

14:09.490 --> 14:11.970
- We're different.
- Not so different.

14:12.090 --> 14:15.412
Most young people in Paris
prefer slacks and sweaters.

14:15.570 --> 14:19.336
I wear them myself in the house.
You can see if you like any of mine.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.293
I've got everything.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.254
And if there's anything else I want...

14:26.690 --> 14:28.260
I just have to ask for it.

14:29.450 --> 14:31.179
Anything you'd like to borrow?

14:34.370 --> 14:36.134
Go ahead, help yourself.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.654
We're about the same size.

14:41.770 --> 14:43.898
A new cardigan?

14:44.010 --> 14:46.741
I have 19 I never wear. See?

14:46.850 --> 14:48.340
But if I feel like 20...

14:49.210 --> 14:51.451
cardigan number 20 coming up.

14:54.050 --> 14:57.293
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got a life class in the morning.

15:02.410 --> 15:05.459
What's the matter? Embarrassed?

15:05.610 --> 15:07.931
Why? I've got a nice figure.

15:34.090 --> 15:36.058
Well? Good night.

15:39.610 --> 15:41.214
Do you want the full treatment?

15:44.690 --> 15:45.691
Sleep well...

15:47.610 --> 15:48.941
Stepmother.

15:53.490 --> 15:54.901
Good night, Jennifer.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.332
And don't kid yourself
he's in love with you.

16:01.450 --> 16:03.578
He's in love with City 2000.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.412
You know, Paul? I love your city.

16:34.850 --> 16:36.773
Well, it's just the way
a city ought to be.

16:37.650 --> 16:39.891
Not a hotchpotch
of littered-up archaicism,

16:40.010 --> 16:41.500
of century piled upon century,

16:42.610 --> 16:45.659
but something for modern men,
starting from scratch.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.818
They're going to build this one
in South America.

16:47.930 --> 16:49.614
- Paul?
- Hm?

16:49.730 --> 16:52.256
- I love you.
- Yes, I know, darling.

16:52.370 --> 16:55.101
- What?
- I love you, Paul.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.372
Oh, darling!

16:57.490 --> 17:01.461
And I'll never let
City 2000 keep us up till dawn,

17:01.610 --> 17:03.897
tonight or any other night.

17:34.890 --> 17:37.496
Hey, you! Take a place, daddio.

17:37.650 --> 17:40.494
- You and your phoney beatnik friends!
- I said, take a place.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.772
OK, there are other dolls.

17:44.890 --> 17:47.780
- So you made it, granny?
- Gave them the slip? Well, well!

17:47.890 --> 17:49.494
First night the old man's home.

17:49.650 --> 17:52.301
- You're bright an' all. You're the most.
- You're a real catch.

17:52.410 --> 17:55.016
- Yeah, the light-footed kind.
- Easy stuff.

17:55.130 --> 17:57.337
Hey, what's she like,
this big, bad Frenchie?

17:57.450 --> 18:02.217
She's French. Yack, yack, yack.
Strictly zees and zats.

18:02.330 --> 18:05.015
Yeah? Dig me, I'm a captain
of the Cancan Kennel Club.

18:05.130 --> 18:07.371
A real-life Parisian poodle pompadour.

18:08.290 --> 18:10.816
- Is she old?
- Ancient. 24.

18:12.850 --> 18:15.501
- You're at it again.
- Well, it helps.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.856
- I got it from the chemist's.
- Sure there's nothing in it?

18:18.970 --> 18:22.338
- No kicks or nothing?
- Course not. It's strictly for coughs.

18:22.450 --> 18:25.260
Hey, Jen, 24's not too bad.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.055
How can she be so square
if she's French and only 24?

18:28.170 --> 18:30.013
How can you be so square
when you're only 18?

18:30.130 --> 18:32.337
Because it rubs off you onto me.

18:32.450 --> 18:34.612
Tell us, Jen, what does she say?

18:34.730 --> 18:37.495
Nothing to tell.
Pure lonely hearts routine.

19:00.810 --> 19:02.778
Oh, well. Not this time.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.778
Come on, Dave. Make the banshee.

19:18.890 --> 19:21.131
I'm music-minded.

19:24.050 --> 19:26.178
<i>Well, I did just what you told me</i>

19:26.290 --> 19:28.133
<i>You told me to forget</i>

19:28.250 --> 19:31.254
<i>To take some other baby
just as though we'd never met</i>

19:31.370 --> 19:34.897
<i>Well, I did what you told me</i>

19:35.010 --> 19:38.253
<i>I did what you told me</i>

19:38.370 --> 19:40.418
<i>I can't forget</i>

19:40.570 --> 19:43.380
<i>I'm crying yet for you</i>

19:45.170 --> 19:47.491
<i>Well, I threw away your photo</i>

19:47.650 --> 19:49.220
<i>Just like you told me to</i>

19:49.330 --> 19:52.732
<i>I put your letters in the fire
and got one back from you</i>

19:52.850 --> 19:54.500
<i>Well, I did</i>

19:54.650 --> 19:56.061
<i>What you told me</i>

19:56.170 --> 19:57.979
<i>Yes, I did</i>

19:58.090 --> 19:59.580
<i>What you told me</i>

19:59.690 --> 20:01.738
<i>I can't forget</i>

20:01.850 --> 20:04.330
<i>I'm crying yet for you</i>

20:06.290 --> 20:08.054
<i>Hang on, fellas, one time</i>

20:27.370 --> 20:29.850
<i>Well, I still go to the dance hall</i>

20:29.970 --> 20:31.620
<i>Listen to the noise</i>

20:31.730 --> 20:35.052
<i>I try to kid myself
I'm having fun there with the boys</i>

20:35.170 --> 20:36.899
<i>Yes, I did</i>

20:37.010 --> 20:38.455
<i>What you told me</i>

20:38.610 --> 20:41.580
<i>Yes, I did what you told me</i>

20:42.130 --> 20:44.132
<i>I can't forget</i>

20:44.250 --> 20:47.015
<i>I'm crying yet for you</i>

20:50.290 --> 20:52.372
- Well done, Dave.
- Well done, Dave!

20:53.610 --> 20:55.658
Hey, the band's in,
if you kids wanna jive.

21:01.050 --> 21:04.054
Say, baby, you feel terpsichorical?
Let's go downstairs and fly, eh?

21:06.290 --> 21:08.292
- Come on, Dave.
- No, I'm staying here.

21:08.410 --> 21:09.821
Come on!

21:12.490 --> 21:14.174
That broad's got it coming to her.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.612
Jennifer, for goodness sake, hurry up!

23:05.090 --> 23:07.252
She knows how important my conference is.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.293
She's just coming, darling.

23:09.410 --> 23:11.811
Her school is right on the way
to the conference.

23:11.930 --> 23:14.137
Don't fuss. You won't be late.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.173
What should I ever do
without you, darling?

23:16.290 --> 23:18.657
What about including Jennifer
in the dinner tonight?

23:18.770 --> 23:21.011
You want help
with the South American tycoon?

23:21.130 --> 23:23.656
- She's pretty young, you know.
- But very pretty.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.818
And the Foreign Office man too.

23:25.930 --> 23:28.820
You'll be busy flirting with his wife.

23:28.930 --> 23:31.774
You know, the contract for City 2000
should be signed this morning.

23:31.890 --> 23:34.097
It will be like
a sort of celebration tonight.

23:34.210 --> 23:36.099
I'd rather like Jenny to share it with us.

23:36.730 --> 23:38.778
Oh, where is that child?
She'll have to go by bus.

23:38.890 --> 23:40.255
Oh, Paul, please!

23:53.010 --> 23:54.660
Jennifer, hurry up!

24:01.250 --> 24:04.254
Jennifer, I'll pick you up at lunchtime.

24:05.050 --> 24:06.097
Lunch?

24:06.210 --> 24:09.054
Don't tell me you're letting me down.

24:09.170 --> 24:10.217
I forgot.

24:15.450 --> 24:17.976
Bye, darling. I'll collect you at school.

24:35.050 --> 24:37.701
Oh, excuse me.
Do you know Jennifer Linden?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.221
Linden?

24:39.330 --> 24:40.855
Yes, about your age.

24:40.970 --> 24:43.576
Blonde, round face, with long hair.

24:43.690 --> 24:47.251
Oh, yes. Jennifer, the crazy one.
Part of that beatnik crowd.

24:48.130 --> 24:50.576
- Beatnik?
- It's a gimmick from America.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.773
- Hopeless and soapless.
- Where could I find her?

24:53.890 --> 24:56.700
In a cafe in Soho called the Off Beat.
She's always there.

24:56.810 --> 24:58.494
The Off Beat?

24:58.650 --> 24:59.651
Thank you.

25:08.690 --> 25:12.331
Bark, bark. It drives me nuts!
Keeps me running round.

25:12.450 --> 25:14.691
Oh, wrap up, will you?
This will take care of it.

25:14.810 --> 25:17.290
That crazy juice don't help.
Why don't you just see a quack?

25:17.410 --> 25:19.856
- Oh, drop dead.
- You sound like you're going to.

25:19.970 --> 25:22.894
- I wish my old man would.
- Run him nervous like I did mine.

25:23.010 --> 25:25.741
- He'll fall.
- What, him? An army-type general?

25:25.850 --> 25:28.615
- They don't fall, man.
- They only write memoirs.

25:28.730 --> 25:31.051
Yeah. "My War On Three Fronts."

25:31.170 --> 25:33.650
Five editions and still going strong.

25:33.770 --> 25:35.454
- Creep.
- Still, he's good for the green.

25:35.610 --> 25:37.612
Show us what you got today.

25:39.050 --> 25:41.735
That will do me. Keep him on his feet
for another few years.

25:54.090 --> 25:55.091
Hey, Tone.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.735
Hey, gasser, you looking for me?

25:59.850 --> 26:01.693
Fall down, juvenile.

26:03.490 --> 26:05.652
Not bad, not bad.

26:05.770 --> 26:08.011
Ah, you're such a notch, aren't you?

26:08.130 --> 26:09.780
I'm relaxed.

26:47.890 --> 26:50.052
- Man, she's on the button.
- I'll say.

26:50.170 --> 26:52.696
- What's she doing here?
- Are you kidding?

26:52.810 --> 26:56.212
I bet she's meeting that guy
that runs a strip joint across the road.

26:56.330 --> 26:59.459
- He's always looking for new talent.
- What's new about that?

26:59.610 --> 27:01.260
They're all the same shape.

27:02.610 --> 27:03.611
More or less.

27:03.730 --> 27:07.576
That's a pound, treble,
in the 2 o'clock, 2:30 and 3 o'clock.

27:07.690 --> 27:08.816
All right?

27:08.930 --> 27:13.015
Yeah. Now, Pontefract,
I want Blazing Wood in the 3 o'clock...

27:15.050 --> 27:16.495
Some walk!

27:26.970 --> 27:28.699
Now, that's what I call material.

27:33.210 --> 27:35.019
We were going to have lunch together.

27:35.130 --> 27:36.370
So we were.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.731
I called at one, as I said I would.

27:38.850 --> 27:40.932
Lunch wasn't my idea.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.097
I realise that.

27:42.210 --> 27:45.419
Hey, listen to that fractured English.
It's the Paris poodle.

27:45.570 --> 27:47.334
More like a bloodhound.

27:49.410 --> 27:52.254
- May I sit down?
- Oh, I'm so sorry...

27:52.370 --> 27:53.371
Please do.

27:53.490 --> 27:55.697
A swinging cat like you is always welcome.

27:55.810 --> 27:57.221
How do I get a stepmother like you?

27:57.890 --> 28:00.177
Simple. Have a father like Jennifer's.

28:00.290 --> 28:03.419
Oh, I've got a father
but he's weighed down by medals.

28:03.570 --> 28:06.141
Rows and rows.
He's so old, he's a General.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.820
Old and dull too.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.853
Jennifer's father is neither.

28:09.970 --> 28:11.813
He's still a young man.

28:11.930 --> 28:15.013
Hey, Jen, you told us she was robbing
the grave, marrying your old man.

28:15.130 --> 28:18.373
- I said she was square and anti-us.
- Anti-us, that's what you said.

28:19.930 --> 28:23.298
- What about jazz? You dig?
- Rock is all right, but I prefer modern.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.253
- East or west coast?
- West.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.260
- Which one?
- Dave Brubeck for me.

28:28.370 --> 28:30.213
She's crazy too.

28:31.370 --> 28:33.850
- You are a musician?
- Somewhat.

28:33.970 --> 28:35.495
I'd like to hear you.

28:35.650 --> 28:37.379
That's easy if you can hear at all.

28:37.490 --> 28:39.299
He can play it cool, and he sings too.

28:39.410 --> 28:41.253
He sends me over and out.

28:42.290 --> 28:43.132
Please sing.

28:43.850 --> 28:47.218
Doll, for you, anything,
anytime or anywhere.

28:47.330 --> 28:49.901
- But I'm gonna rock it.
- All right, I'm listening.

28:50.010 --> 28:51.375
Stop it, Dave.

28:53.210 --> 28:55.816
Why did you come here
and embarrass me like this?

28:55.930 --> 28:58.581
- Embarrass you?
- Don't I have a right to my own life?

28:58.690 --> 29:02.092
- I stay out of your business.
- We are family now.

29:02.210 --> 29:05.020
Coming here,
making as if you know the score.

29:05.130 --> 29:07.701
East coast, west coast, Dave Brubeck.

29:07.810 --> 29:09.380
You got that out of my book.

29:09.490 --> 29:11.492
Wouldn't you rather
I tried to share your life?

29:11.650 --> 29:13.254
I won't be spied on.

29:13.370 --> 29:15.179
That's the last thing I meant to do.

29:16.210 --> 29:18.497
I know why you married my father.

29:18.650 --> 29:21.221
It's because he's famous and he's rich.

29:22.810 --> 29:24.300
He can give you the things you want.

29:25.210 --> 29:27.258
Play it down, doll. Relax.

29:27.370 --> 29:29.418
Thank you. You're good.

29:29.570 --> 29:31.413
I mean, the most.

29:31.570 --> 29:35.495
But Stepmother, you've only just arrived.
In a moment the dance begins.

29:36.890 --> 29:39.734
You've got the stepmother
mixed up with Cinderella.

29:39.850 --> 29:42.854
- Paul told you about dinner?
- Not sure I can make it.

29:43.770 --> 29:44.976
Will you try?

29:45.090 --> 29:47.934
So we can discuss
my report card with Daddy?

29:48.050 --> 29:49.779
There won't be any report.

29:56.610 --> 29:58.612
Nichole!

30:02.330 --> 30:03.570
Hey, do you dig that one?

30:08.090 --> 30:10.457
- Kenny's waiting for you.
- Who's the pal?

30:11.250 --> 30:13.935
She's no pal,
just a bitch with a short memory.

30:15.170 --> 30:17.901
- What's that you're drinking?
- Fruit juice.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.011
Are you mad?

30:20.410 --> 30:22.333
That's Greta. They call her the Duchess.

30:22.450 --> 30:25.215
When she peels, she makes
like she's doing you a favour.

30:25.330 --> 30:28.140
- Peels?
- Come on now, pigeon.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.856
She strips across the street
in Les Girls club.

30:30.970 --> 30:34.656
17 shillings. That's what the suckers pay
for seeing her in her birthday suit.

30:34.770 --> 30:37.899
Just imagine wicked old Frenchie
knowing a broad like that.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.774
Yes, just imagine!

30:40.810 --> 30:42.778
Daddy will be most interested.

30:46.210 --> 30:50.010
I owe you a great deal, Your Excellency.
I never thought you'd get it through.

30:50.130 --> 30:52.815
The opposition had to oppose
or they would be out of business.

30:52.930 --> 30:55.217
That is politics, part of the game.

30:55.330 --> 30:56.411
But I can tell you,

30:56.570 --> 30:58.572
now that the contract
is signed and sealed,

30:58.690 --> 31:00.818
they will be very pleased.

31:00.930 --> 31:02.659
As HM's counsellor on the spot,

31:02.770 --> 31:05.057
I can tell you
the opposition leader confirmed that.

31:05.170 --> 31:07.138
Not a man I care to deal with.

31:07.250 --> 31:09.696
My brother, you know.
He went in for politics.

31:09.810 --> 31:11.141
Slippery customer.

31:12.850 --> 31:15.376
The ambassador and your husband
are just having a nightcap.

31:15.490 --> 31:17.731
- Can I get something for you?
- No, thank you.

31:17.850 --> 31:20.774
It's a shame to leave so early
but we fly back at the crack of dawn.

31:20.890 --> 31:22.096
Oh, I'll hurry them up.

31:25.090 --> 31:27.821
- You're fond of music?
- If it's beat.

31:27.930 --> 31:30.376
- Jazz, you know.
- Of course.

31:30.490 --> 31:32.891
I hear they're dancing
the Charleston again.

31:33.010 --> 31:36.492
- Shades of my youth.
- Only deads, not the real cats.

31:38.290 --> 31:40.816
That's what I call
Jenny's expressive language.

31:40.930 --> 31:43.456
- Afraid I must be very silly but...
- Coffee bars.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.090
I must confess,
I've never been in a coffee bar.

31:46.210 --> 31:48.451
- No, neither have I.
- Nichole has.

31:48.610 --> 31:50.374
We had lunch in one today.

31:51.690 --> 31:52.816
Yes, it was fun.

31:52.930 --> 31:55.615
I believe some of those places
can be awful.

31:55.730 --> 31:57.858
This was charming, full of young people.

31:57.970 --> 32:00.132
- Art students.
- And dancers.

32:00.970 --> 32:03.052
One was an old friend of Nichole's.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.697
Yes, somebody I knew years ago.
I don't even remember her name.

32:08.810 --> 32:10.221
Her name is Greta.

32:11.570 --> 32:12.731
Oh, of course.

32:14.130 --> 32:15.780
They call her the Duchess.

32:17.330 --> 32:19.617
That's very mysterious.
Is she really a duchess?

32:19.730 --> 32:23.780
Hardly. She's a dancer, of sorts.

32:23.890 --> 32:26.370
- Your Excellency, may I suggest...
- Yes, yes, we must go.

32:28.890 --> 32:30.460
It has been a delightful evening.

32:30.610 --> 32:33.420
I hope we shall see you and
your husband more often in my country.

32:37.170 --> 32:38.171
Cooper?

32:44.570 --> 32:46.254
What shall I tell the press?

32:46.370 --> 32:48.896
- I leave it to your discretion.
- Thank you.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.250
- Good night.
- Good night.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.696
You look very pretty tonight, Jennifer.

32:55.810 --> 32:58.700
I stayed and talked to your friend Greta.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.891
Really?

33:00.010 --> 33:03.093
She remembered you all right.
She said you were a bitch.

33:05.090 --> 33:07.457
Jennifer, did I hear right?

33:07.610 --> 33:09.692
Who is this woman?
What did you talk about?

33:09.810 --> 33:13.019
- We talked about striptease.
- You talked about what?

33:13.130 --> 33:14.461
Striptease.

33:21.570 --> 33:23.572
Can I help it if that's what she does?

33:23.690 --> 33:25.260
She's Nichole's friend.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.020
I haven't seen her for years.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.134
She works at Les Girls. It's quite a dump.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.014
- She must be pretty low.
- That's enough.

33:34.770 --> 33:39.139
They call her the Duchess.
Imagine, a stripping duchess!

33:39.250 --> 33:41.935
Poor Greta. I had no idea
she had sunk so low.

33:42.050 --> 33:45.020
Just imagine it, Daddy,
every time Nichole's friend strips

33:45.130 --> 33:48.339
over 100 dirty old men crowd
into a little room to watch her.

33:48.450 --> 33:52.455
And they pay 17 shillings each.
That's a lot of money, isn't it?

33:52.610 --> 33:54.180
Where did you learn all this?

33:54.290 --> 33:56.292
This is terrible, terrible.

33:56.410 --> 33:59.380
Greta used to be
so talented, so ambitious.

34:00.050 --> 34:04.294
All she ever talked about was her career.
We began in the ballet together.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.811
Ballet? Do you mind?

34:06.930 --> 34:10.172
If either of you were ever on your points,
then I'm a tightrope walker.

34:10.290 --> 34:11.974
Jennifer!

34:12.090 --> 34:13.819
Did you tell her I'd been a dancer?

34:13.929 --> 34:15.011
No, we...

34:16.090 --> 34:19.014
We haven't had much time
to discuss things yet.

34:19.130 --> 34:21.781
You must teach me
some steps one day, Nichole.

34:21.889 --> 34:24.130
I doubt there is much I could teach you.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.061
You could always try.

34:29.969 --> 34:31.779
<i>Take it off, take it off</i>

34:31.889 --> 34:33.096
<i>Said the boys in the rear</i>

34:33.210 --> 34:35.656
<i>And she unzipped her zipper...</i>

34:36.570 --> 34:38.299
Well, Nichole,

34:38.409 --> 34:40.378
what is this all about?

34:40.489 --> 34:42.697
Nothing.

34:42.810 --> 34:43.891
Darling...

34:45.570 --> 34:48.414
- You don't like her, do you?
- I don't like her?

34:50.010 --> 34:51.295
I can't understand her.

34:51.929 --> 34:56.139
She hates me. She's hated me
ever since I set foot in this house.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.740
Oh, I don't think so, darling.

34:57.850 --> 34:59.454
Why won't you face it?

34:59.610 --> 35:01.817
That's what I'm trying to do.

35:01.930 --> 35:03.932
So let's get back
to this old friend of yours.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.892
The one that told Jennifer
about striptease.

35:07.570 --> 35:08.696
I told you about her.

35:09.410 --> 35:10.935
Yes, but there's more, isn't there?

35:12.490 --> 35:13.491
Isn't there, Nichole?

35:14.330 --> 35:16.298
I told you,
we were in the ballet together.

35:17.170 --> 35:19.172
Now she has altered her way of life.

35:19.290 --> 35:21.292
I am not responsible
for what she has become.

35:22.610 --> 35:24.100
Look, I didn't say that.

35:25.210 --> 35:28.054
There are lots of things
that happened to us before we met.

35:28.170 --> 35:29.695
Can't we talk about them sensibly?

35:30.370 --> 35:33.135
It's the same all over the world, Paul.

35:33.250 --> 35:36.254
Girls start off together,
have the same chances.

35:37.290 --> 35:39.975
Some go straight, others go bad.

35:40.970 --> 35:42.654
Greta wasn't lucky.

35:43.250 --> 35:44.695
With me, it was different.

35:45.370 --> 35:48.692
- I met you and I fell in love.
- As simple as that?

35:49.370 --> 35:51.418
Just as simple as that.

35:51.570 --> 35:52.731
Darling.

36:30.650 --> 36:32.857
Go on. I'll be there in a minute.

36:32.970 --> 36:34.574
OK, be exclusive.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.374
Come on, she's in a mood.

36:57.970 --> 37:01.133
Looks nice, doesn't she, kid?
Like to go in with me and see her?

37:01.250 --> 37:02.297
Creep! Shove off.

37:02.410 --> 37:05.095
Now, girlie, is that a nice way to talk?

37:06.730 --> 37:09.461
- For grown-ups, kid.
- I've got money. Here.

37:09.610 --> 37:12.216
You could be the Bank of England,
you're still not old enough.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.378
Now, why not go home to Mum, eh?

37:14.490 --> 37:16.857
I've got to see Greta. We have a date.

37:16.970 --> 37:18.654
- I have to see her.
- Oh?

37:18.770 --> 37:21.580
- What's your name?
- Nichole.

37:21.690 --> 37:23.055
Well, just a minute.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.258
Call Greta.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.656
Greta?

37:28.770 --> 37:30.852
A young lady here says
she's got a date with you.

37:30.970 --> 37:32.131
Name of Nichole.

37:33.090 --> 37:34.091
OK.

37:35.690 --> 37:36.896
This way, Miss.

40:06.810 --> 40:09.780
Now, gentlemen,
a thrill both sides of the footlights.

40:09.890 --> 40:12.257
The first of our amateur
talent competitors,

40:12.370 --> 40:13.974
a lovely little child of nature...

40:14.090 --> 40:17.253
Now, just take your time, baby.
Begin slowly, you know what I mean?

40:17.370 --> 40:20.453
Build it up, make 'em wait,
keep 'em on the end of that G-string.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.291
Tease 'em.

40:22.410 --> 40:24.219
It's easy. Just don't look at 'em, Annie.

40:24.330 --> 40:26.776
- Get it over first.
- Ah, shut up.

40:26.890 --> 40:28.892
Now, all right, you're on. Now, remember,

40:29.010 --> 40:31.741
a fiver for the day
and a job if you really send 'em.

40:31.850 --> 40:35.332
Just you watch,
they'll fall right off their seats.

40:37.730 --> 40:39.858
She's too young, Simon. It's a shame.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.574
When did you join the Salvation Army?

40:41.690 --> 40:43.454
Cut it out, Mavis. Get back to your bar.

40:45.810 --> 40:48.381
Now, you... really know how.

40:52.610 --> 40:53.611
Went all right.

41:30.850 --> 41:32.739
Not bad, not bad at all.

41:33.890 --> 41:37.178
- I'm glad you approve.
- You certainly know how to pick them.

41:37.290 --> 41:40.737
A real madame.
I ought to set you up in a house.

41:40.850 --> 41:42.579
I'm not ready for that kind of work yet.

41:54.410 --> 41:55.821
Promising.

42:07.570 --> 42:09.174
Greta, please!

42:10.290 --> 42:12.941
These days anyone would think
you loathed the sight of me.

42:14.570 --> 42:16.459
Kenny, what's the matter?

42:19.810 --> 42:22.973
- There's a girl outside to see you.
- All right, show her in.

42:23.090 --> 42:24.740
No, it's for me.

42:29.490 --> 42:32.175
The tickets, last plane Saturday night.

42:32.290 --> 42:35.100
Why you want to go to Paris,
I don't know. It's corny.

42:35.210 --> 42:37.497
Brighton's corny too, but it's nearer.

42:37.650 --> 42:40.130
Yes, but Paris does things for a girl.

42:40.250 --> 42:41.775
Why blame Paris?

42:42.610 --> 42:44.772
Out there with Greta, quite the dish.

42:44.890 --> 42:45.891
Oh?

42:46.010 --> 42:47.853
Careful, it's jailbait.

42:47.970 --> 42:49.779
You've got a filthy mind, haven't you?

42:49.890 --> 42:52.496
I know. Nauseating, isn't it?

42:52.650 --> 42:54.414
You'll have to divorce me, darling.

43:16.850 --> 43:19.581
The name "Nichole" made me think
you were somebody I knew.

43:19.690 --> 43:21.101
Nichole married my father.

43:22.170 --> 43:23.695
Oh.

43:23.810 --> 43:26.017
Well, there's more than one Nichole
in the world.

43:26.130 --> 43:28.098
I was with her in the Off Beat
this afternoon.

43:29.010 --> 43:31.490
What does that prove?
Where do I come into this?

43:31.650 --> 43:33.379
She told me you once worked together.

43:33.490 --> 43:35.731
I don't know what you're talking about.

43:35.850 --> 43:37.261
Was it a joint like this?

43:38.410 --> 43:41.061
Now, look, kid, don't bother me. I'm busy.

43:41.170 --> 43:43.138
How did you like it when she cut you dead?

43:43.250 --> 43:45.821
Oh, barge off! Go on, clear off!

43:45.930 --> 43:49.252
What's she so frightened of?
Is it of you or is it...?

43:49.370 --> 43:51.816
Now, look here, kid.
Forget all this Nichole business.

43:51.930 --> 43:54.251
I made a mistake. We all make mistakes.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.899
I don't know any Nichole.

43:57.010 --> 43:58.853
Now, clear out
while you've got the chance.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.381
What's the hurry, Greta?

44:02.650 --> 44:06.450
Bring the little lady into my office
and we'll all have a nice little chat, hm?

44:19.330 --> 44:22.971
Look... I can see out,
but they can't see in.

44:23.090 --> 44:26.014
That's the only way I can tell
if the girls are earning their money.

44:26.130 --> 44:28.701
Now, you just sit down there
and tell me all about it.

44:29.610 --> 44:32.978
Sounds as if maybe
Greta's been holding out on you.

44:33.090 --> 44:35.696
I wanted to know about
a friend of hers called Nichole.

44:35.810 --> 44:37.255
Hm-hm?

44:37.370 --> 44:39.452
Well, supposing you put me in the picture.

44:39.610 --> 44:41.374
Nichole's my stepmother.

44:42.370 --> 44:43.371
Oh.

44:44.690 --> 44:46.818
Did you know her, Greta?

44:46.930 --> 44:48.170
Well, did you?

44:48.290 --> 44:50.179
We used to work together in Paris.

44:50.970 --> 44:53.257
Was it so hard to tell the child that?

44:53.370 --> 44:55.737
Or maybe you worked in a strip club.

44:55.850 --> 44:57.181
Did you strip?

44:57.290 --> 44:59.611
All dancers do something like that
sometime or other.

45:01.170 --> 45:03.377
Well, what else did you do in gay Paree?

45:04.450 --> 45:06.100
What about the gentlemen, hm?

45:07.810 --> 45:09.300
Oh, we had friends.

45:11.090 --> 45:14.412
I have a friend in you, lover boy.

45:14.570 --> 45:15.571
Friends?

45:16.690 --> 45:18.135
You mean customers, don't you?

45:19.930 --> 45:23.457
The nearest I came to a brothel
was when I came here with you.

45:23.610 --> 45:25.180
Get out. Get out!

45:32.330 --> 45:35.812
You'd better come back tomorrow
and Greta will tell you some more.

45:35.930 --> 45:38.217
- Do you think there's more?
- Oh, yes.

45:38.330 --> 45:41.459
When Greta sets her mind to it,
she'll tell you anything you want to hear.

45:42.650 --> 45:43.981
Well, goodbye for now.

45:45.450 --> 45:46.576
Wait a minute.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.935
Looks easy, doesn't it? But it isn't.

45:59.050 --> 46:00.734
Takes a long time to learn.

46:02.010 --> 46:03.011
Interested?

46:03.730 --> 46:06.017
25 quid a week for yourself.

46:06.130 --> 46:09.054
- I don't need money.
- You're so right. It isn't everything.

46:10.410 --> 46:13.095
But there's a thrill in this work.
All the girls say so.

46:13.210 --> 46:14.655
A real thrill.

46:15.770 --> 46:18.421
Besides, it's a shame
to waste a nice figure.

46:20.770 --> 46:22.898
See you tomorrow maybe.

46:23.010 --> 46:24.011
Maybe.

46:56.130 --> 46:58.940
Any explanations, Jennifer?

46:59.050 --> 47:00.381
What about?

47:00.490 --> 47:02.094
It happens to be three o'clock.

47:02.210 --> 47:05.214
No, it's not, it's five to and I'm tired.

47:06.450 --> 47:07.895
Come in here.

47:12.370 --> 47:13.371
Well?

47:14.370 --> 47:16.134
- Where have you been?
- Out.

47:17.490 --> 47:19.015
Jennifer...

47:19.130 --> 47:22.213
I'm trying to keep my temper,
but I'm finding it very difficult.

47:23.650 --> 47:25.857
I've been with friends, dancing.

47:25.970 --> 47:28.655
When I found you weren't in your room,
I was worried to death.

47:28.770 --> 47:32.456
These clothes
and all this muck on your face,

47:32.610 --> 47:35.773
they may make you feel grown-up
but you're still a little girl, you know.

47:35.890 --> 47:37.130
To you I am.

47:37.250 --> 47:41.255
And if the rest of your friends are like
this dancer Greta you told me about...

47:41.370 --> 47:43.816
She's no friend of mine.
Ask Nichole about her.

47:43.930 --> 47:45.455
Leave Nichole out of this.

47:45.610 --> 47:47.021
That couldn't suit me better.

47:48.130 --> 47:50.178
But you've been to this café again,
haven't you?

47:50.290 --> 47:53.612
Oh, are we going through
that corny hearts and flowers routine?

47:53.730 --> 47:54.936
"Don't stay out late, dear.

47:55.050 --> 47:57.974
"Little girls get into serious trouble
if they mix with strangers.

47:58.090 --> 47:59.296
"Men are not to be trusted."

48:01.410 --> 48:02.411
Jennifer...

48:03.450 --> 48:05.612
I'm trying so hard to understand you,

48:06.370 --> 48:08.259
but we seem to be
out of touch with each other.

48:08.370 --> 48:09.656
That's no news to me.

48:09.770 --> 48:12.011
But you're my daughter,
my own flesh and blood.

48:13.330 --> 48:14.934
I do really love you, you know.

48:15.930 --> 48:17.341
You don't love me.

48:18.330 --> 48:19.570
You think you do.

48:20.610 --> 48:22.897
You said it so often
you made yourself believe it.

48:23.890 --> 48:26.291
You don't really ever look at me,
not really.

48:27.010 --> 48:30.378
None of you squares ever do.
You see what you want to see.

48:31.130 --> 48:33.451
A bunch of teenagers
lumped together under one label.

48:33.610 --> 48:35.772
But we're us,
nothing to do with our parents.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.571
I am me, Jennifer Linden,

48:38.690 --> 48:41.216
a complete, whole,
independent living person.

48:43.330 --> 48:47.016
At one time or another, all of us
need to be dependent on someone.

48:48.090 --> 48:50.616
Our trouble is,
we haven't been a complete unit.

48:50.730 --> 48:54.291
But now things are different.
Why don't you give it a chance?

48:54.410 --> 48:55.855
I prefer it this way.

48:57.570 --> 48:59.891
I've been pretty lonely, Jennifer.

49:00.010 --> 49:03.253
Well, look what it's done to you,
dried you up,

49:03.370 --> 49:06.977
so you only get a kick
out of that crazy city of yours.

49:07.090 --> 49:09.696
What's this got to do with me and my life?

49:09.810 --> 49:11.460
And where do you get your kicks from?

49:12.570 --> 49:15.972
Sitting around in cafés,
listening to gramophone records?

49:16.090 --> 49:18.218
Jiving in underground cellars and caves?

49:19.810 --> 49:22.051
You are a real square, aren't you?

49:22.170 --> 49:24.776
This language, these words,
what does it mean?

49:24.890 --> 49:27.621
It means us, something that's ours.

49:27.730 --> 49:29.459
We didn't get it from our parents.

49:29.610 --> 49:32.819
We can express ourselves and
they don't know what we're talking about.

49:32.930 --> 49:34.295
It makes us different.

49:35.290 --> 49:37.258
Why do you need to feel so different?

49:38.730 --> 49:39.731
It's all we've got.

49:40.690 --> 49:43.739
Next week, voom.
Up goes the world in smoke.

49:43.850 --> 49:45.932
And what's the score? Zero.

49:46.050 --> 49:48.496
So now, while it's now, we'll live it up,

49:48.650 --> 49:50.971
do everything, feel everything,
strictly for kicks.

49:51.810 --> 49:54.700
You'll find there's more to life
than kicks, as you call it.

49:54.810 --> 49:56.892
Oh, please. Cut out the message.

49:57.010 --> 49:58.739
People like you build cities,

49:58.850 --> 50:02.935
but you don't understand the first thing
about us who'll have to live in them.

50:03.050 --> 50:04.859
You'd better go to bed now, Jennifer.

50:05.810 --> 50:08.051
I'm not going to try to argue
with you anymore tonight.

50:08.810 --> 50:10.653
But remember this.

50:10.770 --> 50:15.059
If you're not going to try,
I'm afraid I can't.

50:15.170 --> 50:17.138
It's up to you.

50:17.250 --> 50:19.139
Heads you win, tails I lose.

50:19.250 --> 50:20.615
It's always the same thing.

50:21.690 --> 50:23.215
I hate the lot of you.

50:24.570 --> 50:25.810
I hate you!

50:29.170 --> 50:30.581
I hate you!

50:40.730 --> 50:43.779
Well, this is a bit too much.

50:43.890 --> 50:46.177
The old creep downstairs
and now you up here.

50:46.290 --> 50:47.576
I wanted to talk to you.

50:47.690 --> 50:49.772
And the same dialogue too.

50:49.890 --> 50:52.291
Go on, why don't you ask me
where I've been to?

50:54.330 --> 50:56.332
That's easy. The Off Beat club.

50:57.290 --> 50:58.735
Guess again.

50:58.850 --> 51:00.739
Somewhere much more interesting.

51:03.490 --> 51:05.936
Jennifer, what is all this for?

51:06.050 --> 51:07.176
Oh, listen,

51:07.290 --> 51:10.260
before you break my heart,
I'd like to go to bed.

51:10.370 --> 51:12.418
Do you think
I want to sit up half the night?

51:13.250 --> 51:15.139
I should have thought you'd be used to it.

51:16.010 --> 51:17.580
What do you mean?

51:17.690 --> 51:20.660
Most strip joints are open
till early hours, aren't they?

51:20.770 --> 51:22.659
Especially in Paris.

51:22.770 --> 51:25.011
What is this striptease nonsense?

51:25.130 --> 51:27.781
You're not still sticking
to that old ballet story, are you?

51:29.290 --> 51:31.941
Your chum Greta has
quite a different angle.

51:32.050 --> 51:33.893
You haven't been to that club, have you?

51:34.010 --> 51:37.298
Ah, you're with me at last, Stepmother.

51:37.410 --> 51:40.619
Les Girls, the sultry,
saucy Soho striptease,

51:40.730 --> 51:43.210
Starring Greta de Paris,
la Reine du Striptease.

51:43.890 --> 51:45.176
Streep, streep, wah!

51:46.490 --> 51:47.935
How do you like my French?

51:48.890 --> 51:50.335
I had a French governess.

51:51.850 --> 51:53.773
Greta and I had a long chat.

51:53.890 --> 51:56.018
She told me
how you worked together in Paris.

51:56.650 --> 51:58.652
And what else?

51:58.770 --> 51:59.771
That's funny.

52:00.890 --> 52:03.177
Those are the same words
her boyfriend Kenny used.

52:03.890 --> 52:06.734
"What else?" he said.
"What else did you both do in Paris?"

52:08.090 --> 52:09.580
Is there more?

52:09.690 --> 52:12.170
Jennifer, what are you trying to find out?

52:12.290 --> 52:13.780
What have I done to you?

52:13.890 --> 52:15.779
Dig this and dig this real.

52:15.890 --> 52:17.733
I won't have you spying on me.

52:17.850 --> 52:19.659
Keep out of my life
and I keep out of yours.

52:19.770 --> 52:21.420
Spying?

52:21.570 --> 52:24.494
- I wanted to be friends.
- And dig this too.

52:24.650 --> 52:27.938
I am no part of my father's life
and he is no part of mine.

52:28.050 --> 52:30.018
And that goes for you too.

52:30.130 --> 52:32.576
We can't live like strangers
under the same roof.

52:33.770 --> 52:35.374
It's all wrong.

52:35.490 --> 52:37.333
Why can't we be friends?

52:37.450 --> 52:39.100
I'm warning you.

52:40.610 --> 52:43.216
<i>Take it off, take it off,
said the boys in the rear</i>

52:43.330 --> 52:44.570
<i>La la la, la la la...</i>

52:47.130 --> 52:49.497
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

52:50.290 --> 52:51.291
Forgive me.

52:53.290 --> 52:55.770
I wasn't going back to Greta
to find out the rest.

52:56.890 --> 52:59.370
I was just warning you
to keep out of my life.

53:00.690 --> 53:03.341
Now I've changed my mind.

53:14.610 --> 53:18.410
<i>Take it off, take it off,
said the boys in the rear</i>

53:18.570 --> 53:20.572
<i>And she unzipped her zipper...</i>

53:43.330 --> 53:44.741
For the audition?

53:46.090 --> 53:47.251
OK.

53:49.250 --> 53:50.251
Good luck.

54:03.330 --> 54:06.334
That was very, very nice
what you did last night, darling,

54:06.450 --> 54:09.260
but it isn't quite what we want
in a club like this.

54:09.370 --> 54:12.616
Now, tease, will you? Try it again.

54:21.410 --> 54:23.219
Tease, darling, tease.

54:25.410 --> 54:28.698
- How about Brighton, Sunday?
- I don't like winkles.

54:31.690 --> 54:33.101
What do I do with this?

54:34.850 --> 54:36.898
Try it again. Tease, will you?

54:38.730 --> 54:41.131
Tell Greta there's an old friend here.

54:41.250 --> 54:42.820
If she's in. I'll see.

54:48.050 --> 54:49.290
Nichole!

54:50.930 --> 54:52.375
Well!

54:52.490 --> 54:55.175
Greta, I'm sorry about the coffee bar.

54:55.290 --> 54:57.179
I was so surprised to see you.

54:57.290 --> 54:59.497
That's all right. I understand.

54:59.650 --> 55:01.095
I was angry at first, but...

55:02.250 --> 55:03.695
Oh, well, that's life.

55:04.890 --> 55:06.892
So, you're married?

55:07.010 --> 55:08.774
- Is he nice?
- I love him.

55:09.650 --> 55:12.176
I hope he's worth it.

55:12.290 --> 55:14.452
Greta, a girl came here.

55:14.610 --> 55:16.897
Jennifer, my husband's daughter.

55:17.730 --> 55:20.813
Yes, I told her I knew you. Kenny made me.

55:22.050 --> 55:24.781
- Kenny?
- Yeah, he runs this place, and me.

55:25.730 --> 55:29.451
He's a bastard but I love him.
You see? I haven't changed.

55:30.490 --> 55:32.970
- What else did you tell her?
- Nothing.

55:35.090 --> 55:36.933
Nichole, keep her away from here.

55:37.890 --> 55:39.794
It's Kenny. He...

55:47.250 --> 55:48.695
You wanted to see me?

55:48.810 --> 55:52.019
There was a young girl in here
last night, seeing Greta.

55:52.970 --> 55:54.017
And?

55:54.130 --> 55:55.575
Leave her alone.

55:56.210 --> 55:57.780
Oh.

55:57.890 --> 55:59.380
May I ask who you are?

56:00.250 --> 56:01.331
Her stepmother.

56:02.370 --> 56:04.577
So that's what Nichole looks like.

56:05.170 --> 56:07.013
You've come up in the world, haven't you?

56:07.850 --> 56:10.740
I can come down to your level
if I have to, Mr King.

56:11.410 --> 56:12.775
So just listen to me.

56:13.370 --> 56:16.897
If that child comes in here again,
you're going to send her home.

56:18.130 --> 56:21.213
- And if I don't?
- I'll tell my husband.

56:21.330 --> 56:23.173
He'll go straight to the police.

56:24.170 --> 56:26.332
To begin with, the girl's underage.

56:27.330 --> 56:31.130
And with an expert like you,
I'm just not taking the risk.

56:32.250 --> 56:34.173
Do we understand each other, Mr King?

56:35.130 --> 56:36.131
Perfectly.

56:37.410 --> 56:39.981
And will your husband also
understand when he finds out

56:40.090 --> 56:43.697
what his wife and her good friend Greta
got up to while they were in Paris?

56:43.810 --> 56:44.777
Kenny, please.

56:44.890 --> 56:47.052
And how they managed between jobs?

56:47.170 --> 56:48.774
Why did you tell him, Greta?

56:48.890 --> 56:51.211
For goodness sake, why did you tell him?

56:53.210 --> 56:55.133
Your stepdaughter
will be very welcome here,

56:55.250 --> 56:56.740
anytime.

57:00.410 --> 57:01.411
Jennifer?

57:03.450 --> 57:04.451
Jennifer?

57:07.690 --> 57:08.737
Jennifer?

57:10.330 --> 57:11.331
Jennifer?

58:00.450 --> 58:01.975
Hey, looks like it's quite a ball.

58:06.170 --> 58:07.774
Daddio! I'm over and out.

58:07.890 --> 58:09.460
Play it down, doll.

58:09.610 --> 58:12.375
Well, you've got to live for the kicks.
It's all you've got.

58:12.490 --> 58:13.935
Ah, live!

58:36.050 --> 58:38.894
Dave, sing that number and sing it cool.

58:39.010 --> 58:41.331
- Ah, don't play wife.
- Wife?

58:41.450 --> 58:43.771
- I said cool.
- I'll wait.

58:56.850 --> 58:58.614
Sing, dad. Sing.

59:08.810 --> 59:11.256
<i>Well, I saw you sitting there so cool</i>

59:11.370 --> 59:14.214
<i>Like you'd just come out from school</i>

59:14.330 --> 59:15.695
<i>Looking such a pretty sight</i>

59:15.810 --> 59:17.016
<i>Like a stick of dynamite</i>

59:17.130 --> 59:19.098
<i>Sitting on a coffee-bar stool</i>

59:19.210 --> 59:21.861
<i>You're a gasser, that's a fact
and I never can relax</i>

59:21.970 --> 59:24.132
<i>Till I've... made you</i>

59:26.330 --> 59:27.331
<i>Baby</i>

59:28.250 --> 59:29.854
<i>Come on</i>

59:29.970 --> 59:32.371
<i>Well, I feel such a crazy clown</i>

59:32.490 --> 59:34.936
<i>You're the biggest thing in our town</i>

59:35.450 --> 59:38.454
<i>Come on, honey, it ain't fair,
never getting anywhere</i>

59:38.610 --> 59:40.339
<i>How do I melt you down?</i>

59:40.450 --> 59:43.215
<i>Well, you're a gasser, that's a fact,
and I never can relax</i>

59:43.330 --> 59:45.412
<i>Till I've made you</i>

59:46.330 --> 59:48.059
<i>Yeah, make with it now, fellas</i>

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.575
<i>I'm not giving up this chase</i>

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:07.375
<i>I don't wanna lose the case</i>

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:10.300
<i>Every time I make a play,
baby, you just run away</i>

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:12.572
<i>I never made first base</i>

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:15.011
<i>You're a gasser, that's a fact
and I never can relax</i>

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:17.417
<i>Till I've made you</i>

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:24.659
Great, dad, great.
Straight from the fridge.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:25.976
I'm way out.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.412
Ah, this group's not so hot.
Let's go and listen to the other one.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:49.938
- Put it away, creep.
- Look, leave me alone.

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:51.176
You heard me.

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.494
Hey, look, cut it out!

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:02.651
If you wanna fight, go and join the army.
That's the place for squares.

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:25.333
Hey, your medicine's neat gin.
Got any more?

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:29.019
So that's what the cough was in aid of?

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:31.776
Crum.

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:36.577
- You'll have to do better than that.
- Where do you get it?

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:38.818
I pinch it from the sideboard.

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:41.251
"Have a dry martini, General.

01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:43.418
"Or is yours a pinkerton, me old lemon?"

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:47.176
What's the matter with you, boy?
Why do you need that?

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:50.372
Drink's for squares, man.

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:51.651
Kids' stuff.

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.814
Oh, some dump this is.

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.774
It's like the war,
way down in the Underground.

01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:03.941
There she was, my old lady,
snug as a bed bug.

01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:06.779
In the dark on the floor.

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:09.256
That's where she had me.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.941
She was bombed out
so that's where we lived,

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.178
like a bunch of scared rats underground.

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.135
That's the first home I ever had.

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:22.578
My mother came up to London
to be with the old man on his leave.

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:24.451
Crazy.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:27.020
One day a doodlebug.

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.580
The house just went voom!

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:33.375
She went with it.

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:38.132
The old man, of course,
was a hero, a live one.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.333
The desert, Italy, with D-day to come.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.179
Stiff upper lip and all that.

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:47.293
"Don't cry for your mother, boy.
It's not manly."

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.940
When it was over,
I played on the bomb sites,

01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:54.255
down in the cellars, amongst the rats.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.691
I tell you, man,
this is a home from home for me.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.932
From then on, it was strangers,
morning, noon and night.

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:02.892
Strangers.

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:05.058
I know about strangers too.

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:08.058
Oh, we're like rats in a hole, that's us.

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:10.176
The Rat Race Rock.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:15.897
I belong here. I feel good.
This is my life.

01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:18.820
That's because
you're a number one female rat.

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.170
They'll never understand.

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:24.090
Look, whatever you want to do,
it's always, "You're too young, son."

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:26.781
You want to neck in the park.
"Oh, go home, son."

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:30.372
Home? With the General
and his whisky and soda

01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:31.901
and his, "Those were the days!"

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:36.053
Who wants to neck at home?
Gives me the screaming habdabs.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:37.501
We could neck here.

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:40.977
- He doesn't mean necking.
- Yes, I do.

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:42.455
I do. That's just what I mean.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:44.216
<i>Lips to lips, hips to hips</i>

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:47.971
<i>You keep me horizontal
with your big, big love for you...</i>

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.137
Ah, nuts!

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.252
What did you stop for? It was great.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.611
- I was swinging.
- Oh, fade out.

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:56.574
You know, Dave, maybe you're right.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:59.091
Maybe this place does give me
the flying heebie-jeebies.

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:03.215
- Let's have a party.
- What?

01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:05.253
Party, at my place.

01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.293
The old man's out
and there's lots of records.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.220
Hey, Cinderella,
what about the wicked stepmother?

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:14.220
She can fly away on her broom.

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:15.377
Hey, nutcase!

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:17.815
- Feel like a run?
- To where?

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:19.375
- Jen's place.
- Where's that?

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:20.935
22 Exeter Street.

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:23.257
Do you hear that, slum-dwellers?
That's Kensington.

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.079
Ooh, swank. I feel a race coming on.

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:29.291
Oh, boy!

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:36.331
I feel a big wind coming, man.
I'm in the mood.

01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:38.452
- Can I drive?
- Oh, sure. It's all yours.

01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:58.892
What's the matter with you?
Put your foot down.

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:02.253
- Faster, Dave. Faster.
- Have you got the handbrake on?

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.136
Come on, make this car go, boy.
Go on! Go, go!

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.732
Ha, ha! Come on, slow boy!
You'll be late for Christmas.

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:15.295
Go, go!

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:17.253
What's holding you back? You're dragging.

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:18.417
Come on, pass them.

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:20.777
Shut your face!
I could pass them if I wanted to.

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.733
But you don't cos you're chicken.

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:24.011
Watch it, doll.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.700
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.574
Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken!

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.579
What'll you pay for screaming, Jennifer?

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:31.454
- I won't scream.
- You wanna bet.

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.135
I won't. Pass them.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.093
If you scream, you'll play for real, OK?

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:37.651
You're on, man.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.578
Come on, man!

01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:00.498
Yeah! Go on, man. Get that truck back!

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:06.496
Go on, man.

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:07.651
Faster!

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:10.496
Come on, make it go, man.

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.413
Hey, watch it, man. There's a bridge!

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:18.136
Watch it, you bastard!

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:24.215
- You wanna pay me now?
- More action and less talk.

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:35.095
Back! Back, I say!

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:44.220
He'd better chicken cos I won't.

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:52.220
Come on!

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.934
You'll never make it. Stop! Slow down!

01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:21.381
I didn't make a sound, man.
Not the tiniest sound.

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:24.334
- Not the tiniest.
- You'll flip your lid next time.

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:25.656
Try me, daddio.

01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:36.141
You didn't win your bet.

01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.818
It isn't over yet.

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:46.421
Hey, there's a train coming.
Let's play chicken on the rails.

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:49.214
You still didn't win your bet.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:52.300
Ah, who wants their arms
round an iceberg, anyway?

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.331
Iceberg?

01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:56.980
Stop it, you idiot!

01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:01.656
This is a Paris model,
a present from the French poodle.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.215
Come on, Dodo.

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:33.095
<i>Darling, hold me close to you</i>

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:36.896
<i>There ain't a thing that they can do</i>

01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:43.461
<i>It's legal</i>

01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:48.131
<i>When you look at me that way</i>

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:52.297
<i>It's dangerous but strange to say</i>

01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:55.175
<i>It's legal</i>

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:59.337
<i>It's legal</i>

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:03.057
<i>I won't be wicked again</i>

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:07.372
<i>I'll never be bad no more</i>

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:12.220
<i>Just think of the things that we can do</i>

01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:16.619
<i>Without even breaking the law</i>

01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:20.974
<i>Oh, darling, let me never fear</i>

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.060
<i>We're definitely in the clear</i>

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:30.898
<i>It's legal</i>

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:35.578
<i>I won't be wicked again</i>

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:39.932
<i>I'll never be bad no more</i>

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:44.290
<i>Just think of the things that we can do</i>

01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:49.578
<i>Without even breaking the law</i>

01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:53.490
<i>Darling, let me never fear</i>

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:57.371
<i>We're definitely in the clear</i>

01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:00.699
<i>It's legal</i>

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:04.417
<i>It's legal</i>

01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:19.936
You're phoney, just like an iceberg.

01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:24.137
Am I?

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:39.821
Perhaps the ice is melting.

01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:50.421
Go, girl, go. You're warming me.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:58.859
Go on, Jen. Go, go, go.

01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:00.972
Strip like a Frenchie. Strip, strip!

01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:33.054
Melt, melt, melt.

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.390
Jennifer!

01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:57.454
Idiots!

01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:03.451
Get dressed.

01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:05.260
And you, get out of here.

01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:09.011
Frenchie, darling, you're getting stroppy.
Don't claim you haven't seen a doll peel.

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.894
Be a nice Paris poodle.

01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:13.581
- I said, get dressed.
- Hey, hey, Godiva.

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:16.694
Cut out the watch committee routine
and show us a trick or two in French.

01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:21.212
That was a liberty, lady. Quite a liberty.

01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:23.856
Now, when I slap,
it's no brush with a chicken's claw.

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:26.974
- Come off it, Dave.
- Get him out before I call the police.

01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:28.091
Out you go.

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:29.052
Out!

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:31.821
Nobody's leaving.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:35.015
- I say the party's over.
- Drop dead.

01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.019
It's my house and I'll do as I please.

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:40.657
It's your father's house.
I'm his wife and you'll do what I say.

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:43.296
Now, put on your blouse
and get away from that door.

01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:45.651
- I said, get away from that door.
- I'll kill you.

01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:50.940
What the devil's going on here?

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:52.461
They're having a party.

01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:54.419
So it seems.

01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:56.732
Jennifer, get your things on.
Who are these people?

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.261
Jennifer's friends, Paul.

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:00.896
Well, get out of it, all of you.
Go on, get out of my house.

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:11.780
Go on, get out of it,
you jiving, drivelling scum.

01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:13.096
Get out of it!

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:24.219
Put on your clothes.
And take that muck off your face.

01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:27.254
Bringing riffraff here. What sort of place
are you turning this into?

01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:28.701
That's a big laugh.

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.256
Why didn't you ask yourself that
when you brought her here?

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:34.735
The ballet! Ask her what
she and Greta were up to in Paris.

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:38.055
Get her to show you
how she stripped for the customers.

01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:40.692
You and Greta, your boyfriends.

01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:42.858
- Tell him how much you were paid.
- Jennifer!

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:46.901
And if she doesn't know
that much English, go and ask Greta.

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:48.216
Don't, Paul.

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:53.731
Jenny, I...

01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:07.853
It isn't true, is it?

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:09.574
None of it.

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:11.340
It's a lot of nonsense.

01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:14.015
Nichole!

01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:15.734
Tell me it isn't true.

01:18:16.330 --> 01:18:20.733
All that striptease business is childish.
Greta and I did dance some cabaret...

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:22.932
I don't mean that.
You know I don't mean that.

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:25.896
The boyfriends?

01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:29.101
Customers.

01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:32.455
If you prefer.

01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:34.294
Yes, that is true.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:38.571
You?

01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:40.896
My wife?

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:44.292
But why? How?

01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:46.253
You lied to me.

01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:48.020
How have I lied to you?

01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:50.940
Did I tell you I was a virgin
before I married you?

01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:53.257
Did I tell you I'd never been to bed
with another man?

01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:54.371
But you never told me...

01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:58.855
That I accepted the rent money
instead of a bunch of roses?

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:03.410
All right, I never told you.
Is that lying?

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:06.091
No.

01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:08.331
Maybe it isn't.

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:12.500
But you've got to tell me the truth now.

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:14.695
Oh, yes, I'll tell you.

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:17.695
I rowed with my father.

01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:20.296
I walked out.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.375
I was angry,
but I was too proud to go back.

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.500
Greta showed me the way.

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:31.574
It is not easy to stay respectable
on an empty stomach.

01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:34.780
Poor Greta.

01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:36.574
I was the lucky one.

01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:38.741
You came along.

01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:42.501
You came along, all I ever wanted.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:57.656
I love you.

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:01.180
That's all I know.

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:03.650
I love you.

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.377
Taxi!

01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:39.140
Oh, man.

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:45.931
- Ah, send for the body snatchers.
- The joint's dead all right.

01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:49.416
Everything's so dreary. I'm bored.

01:20:49.570 --> 01:20:51.937
Come on, live dangerously.

01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:01.052
Come on, Jen, dance with me.
Let's live it up.

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.376
All right.

01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:11.011
What's your hurry, baby?

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:13.258
Where did you pick up that rubbish inside?

01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:15.134
She saw 'em in the light and took off.

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:28.490
On your way, kid. You're underage.

01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:30.812
Take another look. Remember me?

01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:35.217
OK, you win. In you go.

01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:06.500
Well? How's tricks?

01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:08.254
Nearly run off my feet I am.

01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:10.737
Got to keep the girls at home
these days, eh?

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:13.376
Why did they change the law
just when I'm doing so good?

01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:15.970
I tell you, there's no justice.

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:17.455
Who says?

01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:25.820
Jennifer?

01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:28.376
Nichole, she's not in her room.
She's gone!

01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:06.414
Well, somebody down there likes me.

01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:08.895
I'd quite given you up.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.490
- I didn't say for certain.
- I'm not making any complaints.

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:15.052
It's a woman's privilege to change
her mind, especially if she's beautiful.

01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:18.379
Don't look so surprised.
Is it news to you that you are beautiful?

01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:24.337
Sit down.

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:29.013
Oh, yes, I forgot.
You're underage, aren't you?

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:31.019
It could mean
quite a bit of trouble for me.

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:34.293
- How?
- Your coming here in business hours.

01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:35.457
Who says?

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:37.695
Your stepmother.

01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:41.376
Oh, yes, she made quite a scene,
threatened me with your father.

01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:43.856
Well, forget them.

01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:45.859
They drive into me like a big headache.

01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:48.973
In any case, I'm on my own.

01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:52.854
- I just walked out.
- And came here?

01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:54.734
No, thank you.

01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:57.330
The gang gave me the heebies. I felt flat.

01:24:57.450 --> 01:25:00.454
Well, naturally. What could
those children possibly do for you?

01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:04.698
You need a little help, don't you?

01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:11.853
One way and another,
I think I can offer you quite a future.

01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:31.940
What the hell?

01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:45.417
- Having fun, you lousy teds?
- Any complaints?

01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:52.459
You think you own the bloody streets.

01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:54.977
I'm not fighting. Fighting's for squares.

01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:57.013
It's not worth a bundle. Come on.

01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:26.856
Simon, what are those tickets doing
on Kenny's desk?

01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:29.780
Have you been going through
Kenny's private papers? Is that nice?

01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:32.257
Who's going to Paris and when?

01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:34.293
Kenny feels he needs a change.

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.696
Change?

01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:39.290
Let's face it, Greta. This is it.

01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:42.857
You got your cards and your coppers.
A replacement's arrived.

01:26:42.970 --> 01:26:45.371
Didn't even have the guts
to tell me himself.

01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.697
Well, Kenny's got a lot on his mind.

01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:51.451
He's got his hands full, as you might say.

01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:53.180
I see.

01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:56.260
And now I've done his dirty work,
I'm no more use. Is that it?

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:02.453
I might have known
he never cared a damn for me.

01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:05.500
That's right, girl. Be sensible about it.

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:08.130
Come to think of it, what else can you do?

01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:10.131
What else?

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:13.618
I should get out there and get
one of those suckers to buy you a drink.

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:14.777
Good idea.

01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:17.018
They were in the café.

01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:19.451
- When we first went in.
- Yes.

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:31.371
Look.

01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:33.174
That's some of Jenny's crowd, isn't it?

01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:40.330
- Where's Jennifer?
- I don't know. She walked out on us.

01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:44.135
All right, Alice in Wonderland.

01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:45.490
Tease.

01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:34.611
You see?
I'm not such a dangerous man, am I?

01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:40.734
Two tickets.

01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:42.852
Paris, last plane, Saturday night.

01:28:44.010 --> 01:28:46.490
You could forget
all about those cheap thrills.

01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:51.301
Might even have your name up in lights
on the Champs-Élysées.

01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:56.651
Does the idea appeal to you?

01:29:43.810 --> 01:29:45.938
Kenny's been knifed.
Get the police, quick.

01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:47.131
Murder! Call the police!

01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:54.411
Officer, there's been a murder.

01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:56.015
In our place.

01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.454
My god! Jennifer!

01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:15.059
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.216
I didn't do it.

01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:19.420
I didn't do it!

01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:22.899
Who said you did?

01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:27.778
I reckon I did us all a favour.

01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:32.891
Here, get hold of her, quickly. Stop her.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:34.614
For goodness sake, stop her!

01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:36.619
I know she's in there. I know it.

01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:39.301
Just a minute. There must be
a back entrance somewhere.

01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:47.214
Daddy! Nichole! Come back! Help me!

01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:48.820
- Come back!
- Jennifer!

01:30:48.930 --> 01:30:51.251
It's all right, Officer. It's my daughter.

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:54.412
- So you're her father, are you?
- Yes.

01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:56.572
If it weren't for my pension,
I'd wallop her.

01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:59.660
You'd better take over.
Meanwhile I'll have some particulars.

01:31:03.130 --> 01:31:05.098
You'll find us here if you want us.

01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:07.455
Thank you, Mr Linden.

01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:11.978
It's all right, Jenny.

01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:39.657
Funny, only squares know where to go.
