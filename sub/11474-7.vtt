WEBVTT

00:00.219 --> 00:01.387
Previously on "Hunters"...

00:01.397 --> 00:02.644
(Ted) I want to show you the truth.

00:02.654 --> 00:04.716
Daddy, no, stop, stop!

00:04.726 --> 00:07.156
- This is what we are.
- And what are you?

00:07.721 --> 00:08.726
I don't know.

00:08.760 --> 00:12.145
(Briggs) Musa Wazari, possible
pseudonym for Brother Number Four.

00:12.155 --> 00:15.600
(Jules) That's their leader. He's
like the bin Laden of little green men.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.270
- We found him.
- Brother Number Four?

00:18.302 --> 00:21.473
- (Flynn) You killed my wife.
- No, I am your wife.

00:21.505 --> 00:23.607
Shoot me, do it.

00:23.641 --> 00:24.884
- Do it!
- (gunshot)

00:24.894 --> 00:29.580
Slavich's last words to me were
about Hunters being inside the ETU.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.716
We're not calling the ETU. If
there is a mole and we call it in,

00:32.726 --> 00:35.163
- they'll tip Musa off.
- (Briggs) She's one of them.

00:35.173 --> 00:37.520
If they sent me home to fight
my people, I wouldn't do it.

00:37.530 --> 00:40.090
(Musa) Don't be afraid, you're one of us.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.227
I am your brother. You belong to me.

00:51.187 --> 00:54.578
(Jackson) It's been 48 hours since
we lost contact with Agent Regan.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.842
She was last seen with the
Hunters' leader Musa Wazari.

00:58.852 --> 01:01.620
AKA Brother Number Four.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.915
We'll do everything we
can to bring her home.

01:03.948 --> 01:06.618
But as of now, we have no
line on her whereabouts.

01:06.651 --> 01:09.121
(screaming)

01:16.360 --> 01:17.829
You bastards!

01:17.862 --> 01:19.997
Let me out!

01:20.031 --> 01:21.766
(screaming)

01:21.776 --> 01:24.201
Agent Briggs, in your report
you wrote that Agent Regan

01:24.211 --> 01:27.132
appeared to be a willing
passenger in Musa's helicopter.

01:27.142 --> 01:30.304
Yes, ma'am. From my vantage
point, it looked like that.

01:30.314 --> 01:32.303
They were talking to each other.

01:32.313 --> 01:34.463
Musa didn't have a weapon on her.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.634 --> 01:57.485
I won't do it.

01:57.795 --> 02:00.653
I'm not like you. I'm
not like you, you hear me?

02:00.663 --> 02:01.919
I'm not like you!

02:01.929 --> 02:03.505
We can't assume that she won't talk.

02:03.515 --> 02:06.282
You put anyone under enough duress,
and they'll eventually break.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.895
All the more reason we need to find her.

02:07.905 --> 02:11.362
We have a mole compromising our every move.

02:11.372 --> 02:14.941
And our imperative is to
minimize damage to the ETU.

02:15.606 --> 02:18.467
No, our imperative is to find Agent Regan.

02:18.477 --> 02:20.958
One of ours is in enemy hands.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.194
I'm assuming control.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.497
- You what?
- You heard me.

02:25.861 --> 02:28.461
I'm taking the running of this operation.

02:29.075 --> 02:30.631
Stand down.

02:32.274 --> 02:34.873
We need to determine
what sensitive information

02:34.906 --> 02:36.874
Regan had clearance to,
what she may have accessed

02:36.908 --> 02:38.866
without authorization,

02:38.876 --> 02:42.376
and whether or not any of those
systems have been breached.

02:42.980 --> 02:45.616
And until those tasks are completed,

02:45.650 --> 02:47.986
Agent Regan is on her own.

02:52.398 --> 02:55.760
A parasite controlling her actions,

02:56.019 --> 03:00.998
which made her ill-tempered and confused.

03:01.256 --> 03:04.969
She hid under the deck her
father never finished building.

03:07.412 --> 03:09.006
Thrill of the hunt.

03:10.885 --> 03:13.791
They'd let her off her leash
and she'd bolt into the fields.

03:15.605 --> 03:19.905
Sniffing, whimpering for one of
you little critters to come out.

03:24.794 --> 03:26.479
Thrill of the hunt.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.194
(snaps neck)

03:40.538 --> 03:42.074
It made him happy.

03:43.855 --> 03:45.444
So happy.

Briggs.

04:09.274 --> 04:12.604
- (sighs)
- Why'd you say that shit about Regan?

04:12.940 --> 04:14.269
Because it's true.

04:14.279 --> 04:17.129
You couldn't have seen
Regan and Musa talking.

04:17.983 --> 04:20.947
Well, you saw what you
saw, and I saw what I saw.

04:20.957 --> 04:24.362
You were too far away to see any detail.

04:24.927 --> 04:26.538
You know that.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.498
How's the hand?

04:29.798 --> 04:31.122
What?

04:31.702 --> 04:33.325
The hand tremors?

04:35.347 --> 04:37.996
No idea what you're talking about.

04:38.308 --> 04:41.030
And the panic attack at the prison?

04:42.347 --> 04:43.734
Huh?

04:44.188 --> 04:47.583
And is that booze? And
it's, what, 10:00 a.m.

04:48.630 --> 04:50.174
This isn't about me.

04:50.369 --> 04:52.971
Really? You sure, man?

04:52.981 --> 04:56.203
Because I know PTSD can
mess with a soldier's memory.

04:59.328 --> 05:01.568
So you're a shrink now, too?

05:02.587 --> 05:05.353
I'd trust my word over yours any day.

05:05.363 --> 05:07.952
- We'll see.
- Yes, sir, I'm very well aware

05:07.962 --> 05:09.527
of the time imperative.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.879
I have now assumed command,
and it will be taken care of.

05:14.870 --> 05:16.153
We are in a crisis.

05:16.163 --> 05:19.670
I respect your decision to
assume command, but Ruth...

05:19.703 --> 05:21.785
the implication that my
actions have been anything

05:21.795 --> 05:23.452
less than professional
is personally offensive.

05:23.462 --> 05:26.173
You could have bombed the
prison and killed Musa.

05:26.183 --> 05:28.613
You should have... but you hesitated.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.464
Because Musa is more
valuable alive than dead.

05:33.950 --> 05:37.554
Your decision wasn't strategic,
Truss, it was emotional.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.357
I'd do the same for any member
of this unit including you.

05:40.367 --> 05:43.156
But I'm not the mole, Regan is.

05:43.696 --> 05:45.229
Since the leak in Colombia,

05:45.263 --> 05:48.702
I have done my due diligence
on every agent in this team.

05:48.712 --> 05:51.152
I have had all of them
under constant surveillance.

05:51.162 --> 05:52.804
And I've had you under the same.

05:52.837 --> 05:55.772
Of course. I have nothing to
hide, and I would expect no less.

05:55.806 --> 05:58.976
And yet we've turned up nothing.

05:59.194 --> 06:01.024
Perhaps we haven't gone far enough.

06:03.401 --> 06:05.340
What is she to you, exactly?

06:06.861 --> 06:08.692
You've already got six
children of your own,

06:08.702 --> 06:11.030
and I sense no prurient interest.

06:12.441 --> 06:16.260
Is Agent Regan some sort of
interplanetary missionary project?

06:16.270 --> 06:19.831
"All creatures great and
small? God made them all."

06:20.056 --> 06:22.332
She is not a creature.

06:22.751 --> 06:25.103
She's a soldier, our soldier.

06:25.410 --> 06:28.606
And we must do whatever
it takes to bring her back.

06:30.331 --> 06:31.797
Very well then.

06:32.869 --> 06:35.170
I want a full review
of Agent Regan's files,

06:35.180 --> 06:38.380
and a debriefing on our
paper trail with her by 04:00.

06:45.111 --> 06:46.651
And Truss?

06:46.684 --> 06:48.684
Shut the door on your way out.

07:25.237 --> 07:28.059
It's okay, we're not going to hurt you.

07:47.944 --> 07:49.780
I know you.

07:49.790 --> 07:51.550
You're Abby Carroll.

08:07.598 --> 08:12.037
(meat sizzling)

08:15.672 --> 08:17.441
Allison.

08:20.489 --> 08:22.580
You have been with us for four days now.

08:22.612 --> 08:24.752
Tell me, what have you learned?

08:27.893 --> 08:30.005
I know you killed my parents.

08:30.599 --> 08:32.657
Is that what the humans told you?

08:32.667 --> 08:34.025
It's what I saw.

08:34.034 --> 08:37.538
I had your parents brought in
because your father went native.

08:38.703 --> 08:40.722
I haven't seen him in years.

08:40.732 --> 08:44.135
He ran away in the night
like an unruly child.

08:51.809 --> 08:53.484
I know you're hungry.

08:53.494 --> 08:55.447
Here, let me feed you.

08:57.140 --> 08:58.783
That's right.

09:13.561 --> 09:15.699
- I am your Brother.
- I don't know what that means.

09:15.732 --> 09:17.669
It means you respect me.

09:25.910 --> 09:28.130
(Flynn) Regan's not the mole.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.713
Well, I agree,

09:29.747 --> 09:32.297
but I'm not calling the shots right now.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.919
Finnerman banished me to archives

09:34.952 --> 09:37.088
to keep me out of the loop.

09:37.496 --> 09:40.424
In Turkey, Briggs told me
Jules accused Regan of knowing

09:40.458 --> 09:42.860
more about the Hunter language
than she was letting on.

09:42.892 --> 09:44.016
I never said that.

09:44.026 --> 09:46.330
And I could barely see
Regan in that chopper.

09:46.340 --> 09:49.190
There's no way Briggs
saw what he said he did.

09:50.119 --> 09:51.703
It's a blatant lie.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.737
You think Briggs is the mole?

09:53.771 --> 09:56.708
Exhibiting a passionate
hatred of them is good cover.

09:56.741 --> 09:59.043
Like he's just Hunterphobic
to prove a point.

09:59.075 --> 10:01.646
But I'm not accusing
anyone without evidence.

10:01.679 --> 10:04.061
We could sweep his stuff, just to be safe.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.221
Sir, if we find the mole,
it could lead us to Regan.

10:11.789 --> 10:13.524
Search his belongings.

10:13.534 --> 10:15.482
Jules, keep an eye on Briggs.

10:15.492 --> 10:17.395
Don't tell Finnerman.

10:17.428 --> 10:19.297
(Flynn) Copy that.

10:19.329 --> 10:22.232
(door opens, closes)

10:32.742 --> 10:34.277
Just get it over with.

10:34.310 --> 10:36.017
And what would that be?

10:36.447 --> 10:38.747
Whatever it is you Hunter freaks do.

10:40.102 --> 10:41.986
But I don't want to punish you, Allison.

10:41.996 --> 10:44.122
I want to save you.

10:44.155 --> 10:45.589
From myself, right?

10:45.843 --> 10:48.246
In a way, yes.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.987
I'm going to save you from your humanity.

10:50.997 --> 10:53.131
That is why you came to me.

10:53.164 --> 10:55.333
To be reunited with your own kind.

10:55.366 --> 10:58.302
Terrorists who kill innocent people?

10:58.334 --> 11:00.021
No thanks.

11:00.503 --> 11:03.774
Barbaric, I agree, but also necessary.

11:03.808 --> 11:05.809
What we've done was for our survival.

11:05.843 --> 11:08.746
Not unlike the cruelties
humans commit on each other,

11:08.756 --> 11:10.821
including your beloved Truss Jackson.

11:10.831 --> 11:12.850
You don't know anything about him.

11:13.153 --> 11:14.236
Or humans.

11:14.246 --> 11:17.422
I've lived as a human longer
than you've been alive.

11:17.432 --> 11:20.123
I can tell you with absolute certainty

11:20.156 --> 11:22.459
that no matter how much
you want to believe it,

11:22.745 --> 11:24.402
you're not one of them.

11:24.866 --> 11:26.269
I'm not one of you, either.

11:26.301 --> 11:29.279
Oh, but you are. You are.

11:30.086 --> 11:31.461
This...

11:32.372 --> 11:34.444
This human skin we wear,

11:34.477 --> 11:37.647
it cannot suppress our Hunter urges.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.849
You need to learn

11:39.882 --> 11:43.486
to embrace your hunger, your desire.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.524
The Hunter in you.

11:50.935 --> 11:53.529
I'm going to heal you...

11:56.565 --> 11:59.602
- of your human wound.
- (Regan gasps)

12:38.872 --> 12:40.019
Psst.

12:40.029 --> 12:41.929
Hey, I found something.

12:42.952 --> 12:45.002
Doesn't look at all suspicious.

12:49.473 --> 12:50.740
Hello.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.996
(Jules) I ran diagnostics.
Briggs used the card

12:53.029 --> 12:55.130
to call only one number 14 times,

12:55.164 --> 12:57.364
with the first just under a year ago.

12:57.374 --> 13:00.195
- (Jackson) Who was he calling?
- McCarthy.

13:00.942 --> 13:03.362
The calls stopped when we arrested him.

13:04.389 --> 13:06.638
Briggs was one of Finnerman's hires.

13:06.648 --> 13:08.848
He went Aldrich Ames on our asses.

13:08.931 --> 13:10.178
What he's done is treason.

13:10.212 --> 13:12.068
(Flynn) And he might know where Regan is.

13:12.078 --> 13:15.278
The longer she's out there,
the more she's in danger.

13:16.133 --> 13:19.508
Take this to Finnerman. If she
thinks it comes from me, well,

13:19.518 --> 13:23.518
she'll only have another reason to
think I'm trying to protect Regan.

13:25.279 --> 13:27.231
We never had this conversation.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.298
I got a lead on Regan's whereabouts.

13:29.332 --> 13:31.732
We're running out of time to find her.

13:59.740 --> 14:01.563
You're Flynn's wife.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.366
I never was.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.721
Are you ready?

14:06.885 --> 14:08.560
For what?

14:09.489 --> 14:13.075
The body you inhabit,
think of it as clothing.

14:13.375 --> 14:16.211
Cheap rags that cover the real you.

14:16.463 --> 14:18.047
No thanks.

14:18.256 --> 14:21.183
I've seen what you things really look like.

14:21.439 --> 14:24.721
You have no idea how
beautiful you really are.

14:25.397 --> 14:28.024
Your human form is just an ugly lie.

14:29.796 --> 14:33.538
Like you pretending to be
Flynn's wife and Emme's mom?

14:49.512 --> 14:51.481
What you're about to experience,

14:51.514 --> 14:54.431
I've also experienced. It's not easy.

14:56.713 --> 14:59.913
(whispering) Just remember
that I'm here to help you.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.832
Hey... did you know Regan
has a criminal record?

15:09.865 --> 15:12.315
- When she was a teenager...
- Briggs!

15:28.319 --> 15:29.919
(grunting)

15:30.282 --> 15:33.732
This is bullshit, Carroll.
Did Jackson put you up to this?

15:38.754 --> 15:40.028
Agent Briggs.

15:48.374 --> 15:52.140
Your wacko cult brainwashing
shit isn't going to work on me.

15:52.404 --> 15:54.617
The humans brainwashed you.

15:54.627 --> 15:56.314
We'll purify you.

15:56.565 --> 15:59.235
Blood just like this pumps from your heart,

15:59.268 --> 16:01.570
flows through your veins and arteries,

16:01.602 --> 16:03.939
feeds your organs.

16:03.972 --> 16:06.847
You really have drunk the gray Kool-Aid.

16:10.398 --> 16:12.548
I know you don't want to be here.

16:13.079 --> 16:14.773
You love Flynn.

16:15.283 --> 16:17.058
He loves you.

16:17.619 --> 16:19.483
You have a daughter.

16:19.493 --> 16:21.256
You're a family.

16:21.289 --> 16:22.958
We can get out of here together.

16:22.991 --> 16:24.392
They trust you.

16:24.426 --> 16:26.726
They left you alone with me, please.

16:28.659 --> 16:30.195
I am your prisoner.

16:30.228 --> 16:32.131
You can do whatever you want with me.

16:32.164 --> 16:34.400
No, but this is your chance.

16:35.054 --> 16:37.454
Your chance at getting your life back.

16:47.897 --> 16:49.426
This is my life.

16:51.384 --> 16:54.019
Hunters are my family.

16:54.165 --> 16:55.815
And they're yours, too.

16:57.781 --> 16:59.211
It's okay.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.024
I'm here. It's all going to be okay.

17:05.145 --> 17:08.001
- Do you want to hold my hand?
- Hell no.

17:11.469 --> 17:12.804
Just relax.

17:14.105 --> 17:17.009
(whirring)

17:22.480 --> 17:24.631
I hear them.

17:25.605 --> 17:28.364
(screaming)

17:39.719 --> 17:41.522
(giggling)

17:44.057 --> 17:45.525
Morning, kitty.

17:45.558 --> 17:47.728
Hey, Emme, what do you say we hit Wawa?

17:47.761 --> 17:49.596
Grab some doughnuts on the way to school?

17:49.606 --> 17:53.532
Come on, jelly-filled,
hot chocolate. Let's go.

17:53.565 --> 17:55.635
I'll go by myself.

17:55.668 --> 17:58.171
- It's what us strays do.
- Emme...

17:59.371 --> 18:02.376
You see that, yeah? I'm trying here.

18:02.386 --> 18:04.610
She's a teenager. That's how they roll.

18:04.620 --> 18:08.215
And you are the grown-up...
technically speaking.

18:08.535 --> 18:09.810
Yeah.

18:12.021 --> 18:13.278
I love you.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.016
Who's there?

18:18.824 --> 18:20.975
- (gunshot)
- (screaming)

18:22.450 --> 18:24.694
(screaming)

18:37.743 --> 18:39.879
(Musa) She's fighting hard against us.

18:40.154 --> 18:43.219
- How is she holding up?
- (Abby) She's asleep, finally.

18:43.229 --> 18:45.217
She's stronger than I expected.

18:45.251 --> 18:46.853
And just as stubborn.

18:47.438 --> 18:50.188
She believes she can stay human.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.610
McCarthy said the same about you.

18:53.305 --> 18:55.862
But you returned to us, and so will she.

18:57.629 --> 18:59.899
But being human is all she knows.

18:59.933 --> 19:02.833
You have a unique
perspective on her condition.

19:03.162 --> 19:05.405
Flynn and the girl.

19:05.581 --> 19:06.883
You loved them.

19:07.002 --> 19:09.709
I thought I did, but I was confused.

19:13.150 --> 19:16.449
Which is exactly what
you need to teach her.

19:16.654 --> 19:20.686
That what she believes
herself to be is not real.

19:20.832 --> 19:22.780
She'll be ready for the Purge.

19:22.790 --> 19:25.425
If the latest experiment fails,

19:25.457 --> 19:27.244
we'll need the human.

19:27.353 --> 19:29.295
Sterling Martinez.

19:33.265 --> 19:35.234
Such strange appellations.

19:35.268 --> 19:37.800
She doesn't even know her real name.

19:37.946 --> 19:40.607
(clicking)

19:45.145 --> 19:47.429
Regan wasn't the mole.

19:48.076 --> 19:49.805
She was your scapegoat.

19:53.019 --> 19:55.171
We found this in your locker.

19:55.789 --> 19:57.748
Why sell us out?

19:59.262 --> 20:01.146
Money? Threats?

20:02.257 --> 20:03.930
<i>Ego?</i>

20:04.445 --> 20:05.747
(Flynn) <i>That whole sob story about</i>

20:05.757 --> 20:08.457
<i>your lover getting
ripped apart by Hunters.</i>

20:09.502 --> 20:11.271
Did you ever serve?

20:11.303 --> 20:13.473
Or was that bullshit, too?

20:13.737 --> 20:16.049
You're like a scared little boy,

20:16.643 --> 20:19.757
trying so hard to do
someone else's dirty work.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.288
Too messed up to see you're being used.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.993
Get out of my face.

20:28.521 --> 20:31.258
(distant traffic)

20:32.992 --> 20:35.016
(Regan) This is stupid.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.375
(Jackson) Answer the question.

20:37.895 --> 20:41.801
- Do you know any other Hunters?
- I already answered that.

20:43.735 --> 20:45.582
Do you want to live a normal life?

20:47.407 --> 20:49.708
Then you have to come work for us.

20:49.742 --> 20:51.711
That's the deal we both agreed to.

20:51.743 --> 20:53.813
And who is "us"?

20:54.008 --> 20:58.051
FBI, CIA? The Postal Service?

20:58.898 --> 21:01.111
Take this seriously.

21:01.293 --> 21:03.396
One wrong answer...

21:04.133 --> 21:08.383
Finnerman will send you straight back
to your cell. You may never get out.

21:10.525 --> 21:13.739
Do you know any other Hunters?

21:15.751 --> 21:17.471
Only my parents.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.667
But the Hunters killed them.

21:32.327 --> 21:35.788
Are you loyal to the
United States of America?

21:37.322 --> 21:39.016
I'm loyal to you.

21:49.327 --> 21:50.503
Hagi.

21:50.536 --> 21:53.110
_

21:54.799 --> 21:56.438
_

21:58.408 --> 21:59.783
(speaking in Russian)

22:04.612 --> 22:06.852
What can I help you with my friend?

22:08.487 --> 22:10.222
Do you recall this man?

22:10.255 --> 22:13.627
He fought for the Romanian
anti-communists the same time we did.

22:13.659 --> 22:16.729
I've met him two, maybe three times.

22:16.763 --> 22:18.716
What is he to you?

22:19.264 --> 22:21.073
I just want to reconnect.

22:21.629 --> 22:26.071
I sold him AKs, RPGs, plastic explosives.

22:26.105 --> 22:27.905
You know, the usual stuff.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.079
Nothing else?

22:34.313 --> 22:36.550
This one time, he came to me and he said

22:36.582 --> 22:39.614
that he wanted to buy a mine. Crazy.

22:41.378 --> 22:42.688
A mine?

22:42.698 --> 22:45.458
A mine, a big hole in the ground.

22:45.821 --> 22:48.628
He wanted my help in
bribing local officials.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.730
But the Communists...

22:52.465 --> 22:54.382
What kind of mine?

22:59.205 --> 23:00.706
(gasping)

23:01.955 --> 23:05.078
My name is Allison Regan. I'm 26 years old.

23:05.318 --> 23:07.347
I know, Allison.

23:07.379 --> 23:09.916
I know what you've gone through.

23:10.193 --> 23:13.152
Hiding your molting,
denying your Hunter urges.

23:13.186 --> 23:15.358
Knowing that you don't belong.

23:15.368 --> 23:19.791
I know your confusion,
your fear, your loneliness.

23:20.197 --> 23:21.463
(sobbing)

23:24.281 --> 23:27.613
(gasping) Please don't.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.057
Please don't.

23:30.067 --> 23:32.871
I want to give you a gift,
Allison. The most perfect,

23:32.905 --> 23:35.141
truthful gift you will ever receive.

23:35.174 --> 23:36.977
Shh...

24:07.005 --> 24:12.159
(Regan) Get it off! Get
this skin off me! (screaming)

24:16.988 --> 24:19.674
(sighing) We've been at this for hours.

24:19.684 --> 24:23.121
- Mm-hmm.
- How much longer is this gonna take?

24:25.323 --> 24:26.880
Give us a minute.

24:32.442 --> 24:33.911
No back up.

24:33.944 --> 24:36.313
Well, come on then, do your worst.

24:36.347 --> 24:38.081
I don't give a shit why you did it.

24:38.115 --> 24:41.618
All we care about is
getting Regan back safe.

24:41.652 --> 24:43.921
Briggs, come on, man.

24:44.287 --> 24:46.424
Tell us where she is.

24:46.456 --> 24:48.377
You set me up.

24:48.858 --> 24:51.963
You couldn't prove I was the mole, so...

24:51.995 --> 24:54.331
you planted evidence.

24:54.365 --> 24:55.833
That's crazy.

24:55.866 --> 24:57.367
I wouldn't do that.

24:57.401 --> 24:58.678
I would.

24:59.970 --> 25:03.040
And I did. That shit
about Regan in the chopper.

25:03.072 --> 25:05.175
Regan and the clickety clack...

25:05.209 --> 25:08.713
But the story I told
you about Afghanistan...

25:08.745 --> 25:10.714
that wasn't a lie.

25:10.748 --> 25:12.917
Hunters ripped my heart out.

25:12.950 --> 25:15.235
Brendan was the love of my life.

25:16.353 --> 25:17.750
I served.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.367
We served together.

25:21.424 --> 25:23.091
Until the day we didn't.

25:25.361 --> 25:27.163
And I am the last person

25:27.196 --> 25:30.675
who would cut a deal
with those Guano fuckers.

25:33.454 --> 25:34.947
Whatever the price.

25:42.111 --> 25:45.048
I didn't plant that SIM card in the locker.

25:45.081 --> 25:46.983
And Regan's not here.

25:47.017 --> 25:50.554
Then it's someone who didn't think
through the fact that I'm a cleaner.

25:50.587 --> 25:52.684
That's my
stock-in-trade.

25:53.389 --> 25:55.206
Leave no trace.

26:01.397 --> 26:05.197
Jules ran the diagnostic. Told
us you made the calls to McCarthy.

26:05.789 --> 26:08.189
And he knew about Turkey and Colombia.

26:08.620 --> 26:13.044
And he has access to all our
files, passwords, briefings...

26:13.077 --> 26:16.388
- That son of a bitch.
- We'll need proof.

26:16.398 --> 26:18.100
I'll notify Finnerman.

26:22.586 --> 26:23.890
Shit.

26:28.268 --> 26:30.768
(Briggs) Tech with an unlocked computer?

26:30.974 --> 26:32.774
He wanted us to find this.

26:32.907 --> 26:35.583
He's been watching us the whole time.

26:37.835 --> 26:40.085
Is the steak too well-done for you?

26:40.291 --> 26:42.491
I haven't eaten meat in ten years.

26:42.865 --> 26:45.575
I gave it up after you took my parents.

26:45.585 --> 26:47.059
I was on my own.

26:47.069 --> 26:49.579
- I had to fend for myself.
- By hunting.

26:50.947 --> 26:52.336
Killing felt...

26:53.501 --> 26:54.877
natural.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.088
I hated myself for it.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.225
You've killed for the ETU.

26:59.235 --> 27:03.059
Jackson told me we had to, to save people.

27:03.092 --> 27:06.564
- That we needed to stop you.
- What did your parents tell you?

27:06.995 --> 27:08.293
Not much.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.037
Are they still alive?

27:13.047 --> 27:14.838
The humans know more than I do.

27:14.872 --> 27:18.581
The ETU has more intel on us
than they've shared with you.

27:18.591 --> 27:21.052
They know exactly where
your parents are, I don't.

27:21.062 --> 27:22.504
Well, who does, Jackson?

27:22.514 --> 27:24.599
You've only glimpsed who you truly are.

27:24.631 --> 27:26.953
You must also learn where you come from.

27:26.963 --> 27:29.907
Where we come from. But I'm not
sure you're ready to hear it.

27:29.917 --> 27:31.367
I want to know.

27:31.468 --> 27:32.974
Tell me.

27:33.489 --> 27:34.875
Please, Brother.

27:37.592 --> 27:41.215
(clicking)

27:41.486 --> 27:44.263
(Musa) We come from a war-torn world.

27:44.938 --> 27:46.788
Not unlike this earth.

27:46.821 --> 27:50.925
The battles between the enslaved
and the rulers took many lives.

27:51.334 --> 27:54.576
But I survived as did your parents.

27:58.099 --> 27:59.808
The victors boarded a ship

27:59.818 --> 28:03.370
to take us to a distant planet to colonize.

28:03.380 --> 28:06.440
A world to call our own.

28:06.888 --> 28:08.945
But there was a revolt.

28:11.029 --> 28:14.034
They call themselves the Exalted.

28:16.082 --> 28:18.418
We all fled the ship and fell to earth.

28:18.428 --> 28:20.090
Apart,

28:20.236 --> 28:21.684
desperate,

28:22.184 --> 28:25.125
- alone.
- (clicking)

28:25.159 --> 28:27.495
Until I found others.

28:27.741 --> 28:29.429
This is why we are here.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.437
Are you the Exalted?

28:31.902 --> 28:34.268
- Did you cause the revolt?
- No.

28:34.301 --> 28:35.903
The Exalted are all gone now.

28:36.103 --> 28:39.217
Like I said, there was always a war.

28:39.473 --> 28:42.143
Abby mentioned a breeding camp.

28:42.176 --> 28:44.328
You want to know how you were born.

28:45.917 --> 28:47.886
In the tub, I saw part of it.

28:48.824 --> 28:51.365
Until we become human, we have no gender.

28:51.375 --> 28:54.121
No race either. Our status amongst our kind

28:54.131 --> 28:56.586
is not always reflected in this flesh.

28:56.596 --> 28:58.801
Your parents chose well. You were lucky.

28:58.811 --> 29:00.774
I had to take the first body I found.

29:00.784 --> 29:03.268
I would have preferred
something a little...

29:03.751 --> 29:05.026
taller.

29:06.332 --> 29:07.968
We have no genders.

29:08.471 --> 29:12.406
- That's intense. So how do we...?
- The stirrings that you feel...

29:12.416 --> 29:15.308
You don't understand
what you truly long for.

29:15.341 --> 29:16.711
What you need.

29:16.930 --> 29:18.194
Show me.

29:19.205 --> 29:20.962
I have the perfect guide.

29:21.916 --> 29:23.484
(Musa) Don't be afraid.

29:23.902 --> 29:26.019
Abby will not leave you.

29:26.053 --> 29:28.527
We are all part of one another.

30:06.092 --> 30:10.832
(all clicking)

30:22.832 --> 30:26.970
(keypad beeping)

30:27.004 --> 30:28.106
(line ringing)

30:28.116 --> 30:29.518
It's Jules, Callaway.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.698
The ETU is on to me,
I'm at our meeting point.

30:32.732 --> 30:34.301
I need help now.

30:36.054 --> 30:37.453
Fuck.

30:37.817 --> 30:39.571
Jules is in the wind.

30:40.732 --> 30:42.662
- Apparently he left us a message.
- <i>You didn't say the magic word.</i>

30:42.672 --> 30:45.344
(Finnerman) I bet we paid
him overtime to code this.

30:45.378 --> 30:47.293
Jules was my hire.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.581
He had a congressman as a
reference, for God's sakes.

30:49.614 --> 30:52.684
I mean, that alone
should've raised my hackles.

30:52.901 --> 30:54.740
(Jackson) You couldn't have known.

30:54.750 --> 30:58.127
Jules passed all security
clearances, and...

30:58.137 --> 31:00.883
We went to him, he didn't come to us.

31:00.893 --> 31:04.563
It's not unlike the way we
met up with Musa in Romania.

31:04.597 --> 31:06.766
It hardly compares.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.015
I went to see Hagi.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.782
Despite the fact I
ordered you to stand down.

31:12.792 --> 31:17.008
You'll forgive my recalcitrance
when you see the intel he gave me.

31:20.509 --> 31:22.157
Lithium.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.517
We know about this for sure?

31:24.527 --> 31:27.252
Hunters have been seeking
access to lithium mines

31:27.285 --> 31:31.224
in Romania as far back as 1989.

31:31.469 --> 31:33.563
The raw material for thermonuclear weapons.

31:33.573 --> 31:36.242
My guess, they never stopped.

31:36.275 --> 31:39.395
I ran all the lithium mines in the U.S.

31:39.946 --> 31:42.774
There are a dozen in Wyoming,

31:43.129 --> 31:45.432
five in North Carolina,

31:45.651 --> 31:48.020
and one in West Virginia.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.923
West Virginia, near Circleton?

31:50.957 --> 31:54.654
Only eight miles from
Regan's childhood home.

31:54.664 --> 31:57.530
Owned by a Devil's
Tower Mining Corporation.

31:57.712 --> 32:01.495
Regan's parents could have
been running that mine covertly.

32:01.505 --> 32:04.804
And we need to find
out as soon as possible.

32:05.993 --> 32:08.007
Your unit, your call.

32:12.002 --> 32:13.481
All right, agents, listen up.

32:13.491 --> 32:16.115
We have a possible lead
on a Hunters' hideout.

32:16.149 --> 32:18.891
Devil's Tower Mining
Corporation in West Virginia.

32:18.901 --> 32:20.520
A mine? As in minerals?

32:20.553 --> 32:21.947
As in lithium.

32:21.957 --> 32:25.006
Only the business address we
have for Devil's Tower Mining

32:25.016 --> 32:27.122
is actually an abandoned hospital.

32:27.132 --> 32:28.526
(Flynn) Like some kind of front?

32:28.536 --> 32:30.684
Well, it's a cover for
the Hunters' operation.

32:30.694 --> 32:33.460
Conveniently close to Agent
Regan's childhood home.

32:33.470 --> 32:36.468
- Oh, predictable.
- She's not the mole, Jules is.

32:36.502 --> 32:38.705
Just because he was guilty,
doesn't mean she's innocent.

32:38.737 --> 32:40.693
(Jackson) What we do
know is that both Jules

32:40.703 --> 32:42.123
and Agent Regan are missing,

32:42.133 --> 32:45.111
and our best and only lead
to their whereabouts is here.

32:45.143 --> 32:47.381
The abandoned hospital abuts a forest

32:47.391 --> 32:49.248
which runs along the Allegheny.

32:49.282 --> 32:53.086
The lithium mine itself is also
abandoned, several miles away.

32:53.119 --> 32:56.159
We will start by raiding the
hospital and take it from there.

32:56.169 --> 32:58.157
Let's gear up, move it out.

32:59.158 --> 33:02.838
Jules has left us a message. So,
we'll send him one of our own.

33:04.527 --> 33:05.765
That was...

33:07.778 --> 33:09.016
amazing.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.972
Whatever it was.

33:12.073 --> 33:15.797
Your parents never told you
about the birds and the bees?

33:16.004 --> 33:19.746
I'm starting to realize my parents
never really told me anything.

33:20.246 --> 33:23.556
Well, first off, your mom and
dad aren't your real family.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.366
They were assigned to you.

33:26.206 --> 33:27.606
Like you to Flynn?

33:28.946 --> 33:30.590
Something like that.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.761
Wait, don't tell me Musa's my real dad.

33:34.794 --> 33:36.629
It doesn't work that way.

33:36.661 --> 33:38.230
You come from a group of nine.

33:38.264 --> 33:41.369
The same group I come from, but
from a different breeding cycle.

33:42.613 --> 33:44.343
So we're like sisters?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.914
Sisters who just had sex.

33:47.406 --> 33:49.509
Not a fair comparison.

33:49.834 --> 33:52.526
Hunter relations are not
the same as human relations.

33:52.536 --> 33:53.883
Clearly.

33:54.746 --> 33:58.150
So what about your "human relations"?

33:58.361 --> 34:00.652
I don't have any, not anymore.

34:00.803 --> 34:02.522
But you must miss Flynn?

34:03.088 --> 34:05.619
You were married for six years, right?

34:13.125 --> 34:15.335
That time is over for me.

34:15.822 --> 34:18.125
It's almost over for you too.

34:18.754 --> 34:21.454
There's just one more thing you need to do.

34:22.375 --> 34:24.409
(phone ringing through)

34:24.623 --> 34:27.920
I'm still waiting. Where the hell are you?

34:28.446 --> 34:30.482
(keypad beeping)

34:30.516 --> 34:32.217
(clicking)

34:32.250 --> 34:33.962
(clicking stops)

34:33.972 --> 34:35.855
(keypad beeping)

34:42.103 --> 34:45.462
(clicking)

34:46.799 --> 34:48.668
(panting)

34:57.475 --> 34:59.612
(clicking)

35:09.070 --> 35:10.938
<i>A new species appears.</i>

35:10.948 --> 35:12.742
<i>The most incredible
thing to ever happen</i>

35:12.774 --> 35:14.542
<i>in the history of mankind.</i>

35:14.575 --> 35:16.244
<i>But Hunters are smart,</i>

35:16.278 --> 35:18.498
<i>and they know better than
to try to make peace.</i>

35:18.508 --> 35:20.731
<i>After all, look at how
we treat our own kind.</i>

35:20.741 --> 35:23.551
<i>Good luck finding somebody
else to spy on citizens for you</i>

35:23.584 --> 35:27.084
<i>and order drone strikes for
you and torture people for you.</i>

35:27.426 --> 35:32.060
<i>The ETU let a newborn and
its mother die to get intel.</i>

35:32.760 --> 35:34.881
<i>And we call Hunters terrorists?</i>

35:34.891 --> 35:37.632
<i>Being a good guy doesn't feel
like being a good guy anymore.</i>

35:37.939 --> 35:40.516
<i>I'm done. Game fucking over.</i>

35:41.970 --> 35:43.740
(tires screech)

35:50.743 --> 35:52.204
(Flynn) I hope your Russian
friend is on the money.

35:52.214 --> 35:54.364
(Jackson) He's never let me down.

35:54.816 --> 35:57.210
Search the building. Watch yourselves.

36:16.108 --> 36:19.831
(rattling)

36:20.109 --> 36:22.508
(clicking)

36:30.885 --> 36:34.255
(gasping) No! No!

36:34.289 --> 36:35.491
No!

36:40.328 --> 36:42.265
(heartbeat)

37:04.726 --> 37:07.155
- (clicking)
- No!

37:19.033 --> 37:20.266
(gasping)

37:44.059 --> 37:46.123
(screeching)

37:49.865 --> 37:52.434
(gasping)

37:52.466 --> 37:54.202
(groaning)

37:54.236 --> 37:56.506
(coughs, gurgles)

38:00.575 --> 38:02.677
Please, oh, please.

38:07.348 --> 38:08.885
(soft groaning)

38:15.423 --> 38:17.692
(gurgling)

38:34.008 --> 38:36.758
(Briggs) There's a tub
full of Hunter blood.

38:37.178 --> 38:38.671
It's warm.

38:39.272 --> 38:40.716
Roger that.

39:04.677 --> 39:06.188
Hospital's clear.

39:10.534 --> 39:12.355
What the hell is that?

39:21.926 --> 39:22.958
Sir?

39:29.160 --> 39:30.531
Jules.

39:30.681 --> 39:32.631
(Briggs) They tore him apart.

39:41.977 --> 39:43.980
(cell phone vibrating)

39:46.668 --> 39:47.861
Jackson.

39:49.672 --> 39:50.883
Where?

40:18.182 --> 40:19.611
Are you all right?

40:29.169 --> 40:30.562
What happened?

40:31.964 --> 40:33.402
I got away.

40:47.075 --> 40:48.843
Come on inside the house.
