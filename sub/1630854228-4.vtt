OK, everybody, move.

07:53.128 --> 07:54.671
- Sure.
I'll talk to the bartender!

08:20.409 --> 08:22.070
So some of the courses

08:54.139 --> 08:55.802
- No, no, not exactly dating.

08:55.902 --> 08:59.287
It's just that, uh,
my parents still don't know

08:59.387 --> 09:01.850
that I'm not exactly into men.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.933

changed since college

09:04.033 --> 09:05.536
when you wouldn't let
them know I existed.

09:05.635 --> 09:08.100

13:58.824 --> 14:00.927
Do you believe in signs?

14:01.027 --> 14:03.130
- Like messages
from the universe?

Yeah, why?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.983
- OK, normally I don't.

14:12.082 --> 14:14.507
But I feel like today the
messaging from the universe

14:14.606 --> 14:16.469
has been extra loud.

14:16.568 --> 14:19.313
- Well, the thing about signs
is that they are just signs.

14:19.413 --> 14:21.115
They're not orders.

14:21.216 --> 14:23.440
Ultimately, you get to decide
whatever you want to do.

having pre-wedding jitters.

14:26.945 --> 14:28.647

it's more than that.

that you love

14:30.389 --> 14:32.293
isn't the person that
you need them to be?

14:32.393 --> 14:34.696
