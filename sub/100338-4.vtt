02:22.100 --> 02:23.601
Gabi told me that she's really sad.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.294
So, is everybody healthy?

02:49.377 --> 02:52.046
Well, did I tell you
that Sherbs dislocated her elbow?

03:13.234 --> 03:14.611
What are you gonna do?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.635
Y'all, please don't scream
if something goes wrong.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.136
It's, like, way scarier.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.180
Spotters, be active.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.436
You're supposed to catch like this.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.354
We are.

06:37.855 --> 06:38.898
I catch like this.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.691
Keep the comments to yourself.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.110
Positivity.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.262
Will just has no stamina.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.765
He looks like he's dying,
and he barely does anything.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.517
I mean, I know
he has to hold that pyramid up, but...

13:29.809 --> 13:30.893
I'm just frustrated.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.851
What about Kassidy?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.148
We'll pray for her.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.163
We gotta go to Daytona, like,
in, like, three and a half weeks,

17:03.647 --> 17:05.441
This is why
you go to bed at 7:00 a.m.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.776
So?

17:42.728 --> 17:43.771
Did you talk to her yet?

17:57.659 --> 17:58.994
I low-key could do it now

17:59.078 --> 18:01.413
cause we ain't even doing nothing yet.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.832
Just be like, "You know I'm working
with Delaney,

18:03.916 --> 18:06.835
but is there anything I really,
really need to work on with my stunts?"

19:06.395 --> 19:08.689
Would you be comfortable
if we tried you in the pyramid?

19:08.772 --> 19:11.108
-Is that too much on your plate?
- Yeah, I can do it.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.235
I just need to learn the counts

20:09.208 --> 20:10.500
What made you come
to this decision?

20:13.086 --> 20:14.463
Girl, it was bothering me.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.970
It's just that we've switched twice.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.474
I'm pretty sure
the pressure is gonna be on.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.774
Is Sherbs good?

20:53.293 --> 20:55.379
I can grab your wrist, too,
right?

22:11.455 --> 22:13.874
Once I get a few more reps in,
I'm good.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.789
We're choreographing a whole routine
around you, so I need to know, like,

26:14.739 --> 26:16.074
What's up, problem child?

29:15.754 --> 29:19.257
I just got off the phone
with a police officer,

32:05.965 --> 32:07.091
You don't pant when you stunt?

32:07.175 --> 32:08.343
Yeah you do, don't lie.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.353
Worry about yourself.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.146
You better be worried about
hitting this stunt

32:20.229 --> 32:21.522
before you get replaced by Jerry.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.543
Welcome to the <i>Bad Girls Club.</i>

41:18.893 --> 41:20.686
Do you expect anything less of him?

41:58.807 --> 42:01.101
What class are you in here for?
You're here for two.

42:12.571 --> 42:13.906
Do your solar systems.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.633
Like, posting your,
like, phone number?

43:16.552 --> 43:17.386
Oh.

51:29.127 --> 51:31.171
Because the shoes, they can't dirty up.

53:46.014 --> 53:47.724
<i>Have you been eating clean?</i>

53:51.519 --> 53:53.104
<i>Eggs aren't clean. That's dairy.</i>

53:53.313 --> 53:54.814
<i>If you eat jackfruit,</i>

53:55.065 --> 53:57.943
<i>that can actually hold your stomach</i>
<i>for ten to 12 hours with no other food.</i>

54:13.500 --> 54:15.085
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>by the time College Nationals comes,</i>

54:15.168 --> 54:17.212
<i>I need to know</i>
<i>what you're doing next year.</i>

55:29.868 --> 55:33.455
Why would a person, like,
do that? Can't you report it on Twitter?

55:39.002 --> 55:40.754
That's a lot to deal with.

56:53.618 --> 56:57.330
Gabi's shoulder stand fell,
so then everything just fell after that.

57:12.387 --> 57:14.514
I just like, really want to quit.

57:26.234 --> 57:27.318
She needs a moment.

58:24.918 --> 58:25.919
Don't say another word.
