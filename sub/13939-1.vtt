01:01.975 --> 01:05.933
What should we do on our birthday?

01:06.183 --> 01:09.350
We have plenty of time left
to come up with something, Sue.

01:10.100 --> 01:16.308
We are 18 years old. Then our moms met
BB, we have done something special.

01:16.433 --> 01:21.100
This has become even more special.
What is it we have not done?

01:21.892 --> 01:26.308
-Mushrooms?
-not anything like that. Something nice.

01:26.433 --> 01:30.642
-Maybe a trip?
-A mushroom trip, type?

01:32.517 --> 01:37.183
-I'm sorry, So. I'm going on a date.
-So do I. I'm sorry, Sue.

01:37.975 --> 01:41.058
Do not worry. We will think of something.

01:58.183 --> 02:03.892
-Are the flowers from you?
-Yes, absolutely ... Here you are.

02:04.267 --> 02:08.933
-I thought I saw a card.
-I can not express my feelings.

02:09.058 --> 02:13.225
I guess you
still makes me...

02:14.642 --> 02:18.475
-...nervous.
-Oh, Jake.

02:23.725 --> 02:28.183
-Should I go with in a while?
-No, not yet.

02:28.267 --> 02:32.308
I want it to be special.
The best night of my life.

02:32.433 --> 02:39.225
There it will be. We two
will always be amazing together.

02:46.017 --> 02:50.225
No, Jake. I have to work
on my art projects.

02:50.350 --> 02:55.642
I thought art would be easy,
but I should have chosen more math.

02:57.267 --> 03:02.433
-Are you coming to my birthday party?
-Of course.

03:06.642 --> 03:09.600
Thank you. Goodbye.

03:53.475 --> 03:55.725
Not bad.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.433
-Hey!
-We need to talk birthday plans.

04:02.558 --> 04:06.558
There are only two days left.

04:06.683 --> 04:10.600
I thought we could travel to...

04:10.767 --> 04:15.558
I had thought to tell you...

04:15.683 --> 04:18.725
I think I'll
celebrate the birthday with Jake.

04:18.850 --> 04:22.308
I want to let him take my virginity.

04:22.433 --> 04:28.100
What? You can not!
Should not we wait until we get married?

04:28.225 --> 04:32.975
You can not break
a tradition like that.

04:33.100 --> 04:38.725
It's not good. Lexi will
be very disappointed.

04:44.850 --> 04:47.725
Come on, Lexi ...

04:51.142 --> 04:56.892
-Baby, you're so sexy. Now you'll get.
-Yeah, baby. What was your name again?

04:57.017 --> 05:00.808
Rod, sexguden.

05:06.975 --> 05:10.433
Come on!
It's a real man's body.

05:10.558 --> 05:14.600
Excuse me ... My mobile.

05:16.808 --> 05:20.475
An important call from Sue.
Wait a minute.

05:21.308 --> 05:25.142
-My lenses.
-Come on.

05:25.267 --> 05:30.933
Wait, I have to find lenses.
They're in here somewhere.

05:31.267 --> 05:36.392
-There.
-Nipple ... I asked you to stop.

05:37.725 --> 05:41.558
That's my buddy, JJ. Is it easy?

05:42.892 --> 05:49.017
Yes, I guess. I'm still
innocence, no fucking.

05:59.308 --> 06:04.933
Lexi is so upset that she did not
get a word out ... Yes, yes, yes.

06:26.017 --> 06:30.142
Jeez, five orgasms in a row.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.142
Here is my lens.

06:44.933 --> 06:50.600
Should Cheryl losing her virginity on Saturday?

06:53.100 --> 06:57.267
-It sounds crazy. Must speak.
-As soon as possible.

07:00.517 --> 07:03.725
-Oops.
-Hey.

07:03.892 --> 07:07.767
-When did you get home?
-Is it true?

07:07.933 --> 07:11.433
It is the right time and Jake is the right man.

07:12.267 --> 07:16.808
He is handsome, clever and rich ...

07:16.933 --> 07:21.975
He has a promising future ahead of him.
I think the time is right.

07:22.100 --> 07:26.558
Losing your virginity is something we should
be involved together.

07:26.683 --> 07:32.100
But not on this birthday.
Maybe when we become the 23rd

07:32.225 --> 07:36.517
Maybe even 29? 28?

07:37.600 --> 07:42.017
I know we have a tradition,
but I'm sorry.

07:48.267 --> 07:53.350
Sue is right. We always
something special on her birthday.

07:53.475 --> 07:57.308
Jake has such a small?

07:57.433 --> 08:04.475
It is not Jake. It is the
masculine ideal. A Greek god type.

08:07.142 --> 08:13.475
-Yes, it sucks. I'm no artist.
-Do not change the subject.

08:13.600 --> 08:19.142
We should lose virgins together.
I'm not ready yet.

08:19.267 --> 08:22.350
I'm waiting for a sign.

08:22.475 --> 08:28.017
För mig spelar det ingen roll.
I get by with a 69-ball, 79-ball-

08:28.142 --> 08:31.350
-anal. I did not hurry.

08:31.683 --> 08:35.600
It beats not my rabbit anyway.

08:35.725 --> 08:40.725
But do you want to do it this year,
so maybe we should all do it.

08:40.850 --> 08:45.183
It could be a thing of the 18 th anniversary

08:47.350 --> 08:53.933
-Where are you at 6:30 in the morning?
-To church and pray for you.

08:54.058 --> 08:58.767
-I go to bed.
-So do I.

09:06.267 --> 09:10.642
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

09:10.767 --> 09:15.017
I accuse myself
for the following sins:

09:15.183 --> 09:20.225
I'm embarrassed to talk about it,
but ... it is about sex.

09:20.350 --> 09:22.767
Oh.

09:22.892 --> 09:28.267
It does not apply to me. I
Just do not reach below the waistband.

09:28.392 --> 09:33.267
I have not even seen ... Well, I've
took the clothes of my Ken doll.

09:33.433 --> 09:38.308
I dressed him as Jesus. I wanted
see his thing, but there was no one there.

09:41.142 --> 09:45.308
There are my friends,
my best friends.

09:45.433 --> 09:49.350
It will do something really
poorly this weekend.

09:49.517 --> 09:55.433
-Okay, spins?
-What? No, sex, sexual intercourse.

09:55.558 --> 09:59.767
With the guys they do not know.

09:59.933 --> 10:04.642
-All the way. Go all the way.
-Excuse me?

10:08.767 --> 10:13.725
How can you just?
You are a bad person.

10:14.350 --> 10:16.558
What?

10:20.683 --> 10:25.475
Yes! Yes! Come on!
A home run!

10:27.100 --> 10:31.892
Damn it!
Damn Yankees!

10:32.892 --> 10:34.350
I'm sorry.

10:55.558 --> 11:01.808
Sue, the clock is one.
I actually try to sleep.

11:02.892 --> 11:06.517
Can not you be a little quiet?

11:06.767 --> 11:10.100
I have something to announce.
I want to do it.

11:11.892 --> 11:15.267
Did you hear what I said?
I want to do it.

11:15.392 --> 11:19.225
-This weekend, a happy birthday.
-Doing what?

11:20.183 --> 11:24.975
"That," fuck, pippa ...

11:25.100 --> 11:28.017
...Goka, thread, you know.

11:29.475 --> 11:36.392
How does that work with your religious
thoughts and the sign from heaven?

11:36.558 --> 11:43.475
-I got a sign in the church.
-Really? Well, here we go.

11:44.517 --> 11:50.433
-We have a pool party and do it there.
-All right.

11:54.308 --> 11:57.725
I start with the shopping list.

11:59.475 --> 12:03.267
Wonder what Jake will give me?

12:03.392 --> 12:08.892
Perhaps a ring?
Or maybe a puppy?

12:09.058 --> 12:12.308
It is the beginning of our family.

12:12.433 --> 12:15.725
Check this out!

12:16.475 --> 12:22.058
What disgusting. Put it to
Sue did not see it. She gets hjärtsnörp..

12:31.392 --> 12:37.600
-Your bra has no cups.
-That's why it's called kuplös bra.

12:37.725 --> 12:42.308
-Is it sexy?
-No, urfånigt.

12:42.433 --> 12:49.475
As a bald wig,
or fingerless gloves ...

12:49.600 --> 12:54.558
...or glue to paste.
Or panties without branch.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.933
All right. Thank you for remind me.

12:58.058 --> 13:00.725
Party and Favvisar!

13:04.600 --> 13:08.433
-So wrong!
-I know.

13:08.558 --> 13:13.225
It does not vibrate. It's broken,
but I have one more.

13:13.308 --> 13:19.600
What is it? Do you prefer a manual
or a vibrating?

13:19.725 --> 13:25.850
You mean ... you've never masturbated?

13:26.017 --> 13:28.642
-Yes.
-never?

13:28.767 --> 13:32.142
-never.
-Never ever?

13:32.850 --> 13:36.017
-Yes.
-Not even when you sleep?

13:36.142 --> 13:39.975
Or when you are bored?
Or when you're worried?

13:40.100 --> 13:43.350
On the morning to wake up,
or in the evening to fall asleep?

13:43.517 --> 13:47.017
Or when you think of Jake
and my new puppy?

13:47.142 --> 13:49.933
Or when you visit your brother's grave?

13:50.058 --> 13:54.100
-Or when you witness a murder?
-Or get lipstick on your teeth?

13:54.225 --> 13:58.100
-Or when skydiving?
-when you empty your credit card?

13:58.225 --> 14:00.933
Or play jigsaw puzzle with Grandma?

14:01.058 --> 14:05.850
-Or just because you are ...
-...so fucking horny?

14:06.017 --> 14:09.933
No, never, never ever, type!

14:11.725 --> 14:17.642
-Seriously?
-Let it go. We have a house to decorate.

14:17.892 --> 14:22.392
-Okay, then.
-I just can not believe it.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.892
-Hey, Frank!
-Hi, Sue!

14:30.017 --> 14:36.517
-We have not commanded him.
-Do you think he would have fun?

14:36.642 --> 14:40.433
Blind people can do everything
others can do.

14:43.058 --> 14:45.517
He waves to return.

14:47.058 --> 14:52.058
We will have party tomorrow night.
Wanna come?

15:24.892 --> 15:30.017
-It looks finished print.
-Tomorrow we will finally 18!

15:30.142 --> 15:33.183
And finally, we lose our virgins.

15:33.267 --> 15:37.308
We need to get our beauty sleep.
The party begins at two o'clock.

15:37.475 --> 15:41.517
Cheryl should do it with Jake.
I'll probably Rod.

15:41.642 --> 15:44.683
Who should be blowing your Modis, Sue?

15:44.808 --> 15:49.517
It is easy. I have known him only
Late catechism lessons.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.850
I think it's a baby panda
smeared in peanut butter.

15:54.975 --> 15:57.225
Lev A LOVINGLY LLV

16:01.600 --> 16:05.142
My soul twin.

16:06.058 --> 16:12.225
Chris? Maybe you should think about
on selecting a reserve.

16:12.308 --> 16:17.392
No, Chris is perfect. He played
Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar.

16:17.517 --> 16:24.933
-His name is Chris. It is a character.
-The only sign is his bögnuna.

16:25.058 --> 16:29.267
He does not look like a fag.

16:29.433 --> 16:35.225
He looks like Justin Bieber, and little Zac
Efron and a little Ryan Seacrest.

16:35.350 --> 16:40.808
Who is Ryan Seacrest?
-Chris is my soul twin.

16:40.933 --> 16:45.558
-Dream great dreams.
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:48.267 --> 16:52.558
I knew it would happen one day,
but not this early.

17:21.392 --> 17:24.224
You are so perfect.

17:56.100 --> 17:59.558
I knew it would look like that.

18:14.808 --> 18:19.017
Too bad no one is like you.

18:52.100 --> 18:56.100
Wow, you are perfect.

18:57.267 --> 19:00.475
Who are you?

19:05.392 --> 19:08.600
Tomorrow is it.

19:26.808 --> 19:32.058
<i> Mr. Gee, they will.
Lexi, Cheryl, hurry up. </ I></i>

19:34.308 --> 19:40.225
Why?
-Jake may open me. It gets hot.

19:40.808 --> 19:44.183
You will choke to death.

19:44.267 --> 19:48.100
It is sick. Fuck him only.
That's what every guy wants.

19:48.308 --> 19:52.308
Who hit you when you were little?
I'm taking your mouth too.

19:52.433 --> 19:57.308
Guys want someone who is sexy,
not just somebody they can sleep with.

19:57.433 --> 20:02.850
You're an idiot.
A-sweet, laminated idiot.

20:02.975 --> 20:07.308
Hurry up now.

20:10.933 --> 20:14.267
What a cool bracelet.

20:14.392 --> 20:20.350
-Do not touch it. It is ...
-It's very brittle.

20:21.183 --> 20:23.142
Hurry up!

20:24.225 --> 20:28.100
It was anal beads, right?

20:46.475 --> 20:50.142
This is a fat party!

20:50.933 --> 20:55.642
-Are we having fun or what?
-Wet T-shirts on g

21:04.725 --> 21:10.475
-Congratulations, Lex!
-We said no gifts, Joanna.

21:10.600 --> 21:17.475
That enlarges the lips.
The second is the massage oil.

21:17.600 --> 21:22.058
How did you know?
I could use both tonight.

21:26.392 --> 21:31.225
What cute you are, buster.
-Do not touch my guide dog.

21:31.350 --> 21:36.392
-Excuse me. Are you okay?
-I feel good.

21:40.517 --> 21:43.475
Hear you not heard that?
It is not wise.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.683
Hey, Jake!
-Hey, baby. Congrats.

21:49.683 --> 21:54.850
-You did not have ...
-What? Want a beer?

21:57.058 --> 21:59.350
No.

22:00.975 --> 22:03.600
Come here, baby.

22:05.808 --> 22:09.933
I give you the gift later,
when the time comes.

22:10.642 --> 22:17.933
You did not have to buy anything. I
a gift that you should look it up later.

22:18.725 --> 22:24.017
-We need you for what. Come on!
-What the what?

22:27.058 --> 22:32.017
Here's the man.
Hi, how are you?

22:41.183 --> 22:44.975
Do you dare?

22:55.017 --> 22:58.225
One, two, three.

23:36.017 --> 23:39.225
Check out! Are they authentic?

23:39.350 --> 23:43.350
-Have you seen Cheryl?
-Out of the way!

23:43.683 --> 23:49.183
-Got it. See you later.
-Run some pushups or something.

23:49.267 --> 23:53.267
$ 20 that I will
To tune those.

23:55.767 --> 24:00.350
-They are not genuine.
-Who cares?

24:02.850 --> 24:09.808
-Joe, ha'ru seen such shelf before?
I'm blind, your stupid!

24:12.267 --> 24:17.142
It's your birthday. Let me ...
-Go out and have fun now.

24:17.267 --> 24:21.183
What? I win.

24:21.975 --> 24:27.558
Does my lips bigger?
I know nothing yet.

24:28.308 --> 24:33.017
Have you seen Jake?
He has type disappeared.

24:43.558 --> 24:48.725
-Are they real?
Of course.

24:51.558 --> 24:55.933
-Have you seen Jake, Darryl?
-I think he's here somewhere.

24:56.100 --> 24:58.975
Maybe up there?

24:59.142 --> 25:04.100
Maybe he went to
open my gift.

25:06.225 --> 25:11.642
-To become braver?
-Yes.

25:12.850 --> 25:16.642
-Vodka and cranberry?
-Shirley Temple.

25:16.767 --> 25:20.683
This is it.
I'll go and meet Rod.

25:20.808 --> 25:25.517
Sue, how are you?
Take it easy.

25:26.142 --> 25:31.600
It's just guys. It is
nothing to be afraid of. Is Chris here?

25:36.642 --> 25:42.517
He's even more last year in reality.
He's not gay.

25:42.642 --> 25:49.225
I'm going to prove it. I'll do it.
-Good luck.

25:50.475 --> 25:54.767
You can do it.
Be like a slut only.

25:56.183 --> 25:59.767
Pretend you are Lexi.

26:05.725 --> 26:08.433
Sodom and Gomorrah
is my favorite chapter.

26:08.558 --> 26:13.725
Chris, hi. Can I talk to you?

26:13.850 --> 26:17.267
l studio.

26:28.850 --> 26:31.225
Be like Lexi.

26:31.308 --> 26:35.225
-Excuse me?
-Chris ... You are so sexy.

26:36.475 --> 26:42.642
Since you played Jesus
I knew it was the two of us.

26:42.767 --> 26:47.600
-I really want to ...
-What are you doing?

26:48.683 --> 26:53.267
What has it taken for you?
-Nothing. I do not know what I should do?

26:53.392 --> 26:57.683
Sue, Sue, Sue ...

26:57.808 --> 27:02.767
I understand these desires ...

27:02.892 --> 27:06.433
... And I like you too.

27:06.558 --> 27:10.308
-Do you?
Yeah, I really do.

27:10.433 --> 27:17.517
It's just that I have indulged
my life to a special man ...

27:18.642 --> 27:20.933
-Lexi said.
-Jesus.

27:21.058 --> 27:25.100
-Oh, that man.
-What have you thought?

27:25.225 --> 27:29.850
Nothing. Then we can ...

27:29.975 --> 27:35.642
Sue ... You know ...

27:35.767 --> 27:39.475
When I think of him;
who died for our sins.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.725
When I think of him on the cross ...

27:43.850 --> 27:48.475
... So helpless and yet so muscular.

27:48.600 --> 27:54.975
His strong thighs crossed ...

27:55.142 --> 27:59.683
... So beautiful during the
where worn hip curtain ...

27:59.808 --> 28:05.850
... So hot and so sweaty
under the hot sun.

28:05.975 --> 28:10.058
Then I feel a kind of pity.

28:10.183 --> 28:15.142
-I also think the same.
-Then you'll understand why I can not.

28:15.767 --> 28:18.683
-Not directly.
It's too difficult.

28:18.808 --> 28:23.517
It is difficult to give
after the fleshly lusts-

28:23.642 --> 28:27.892
-When he suffered so
for our sake. So ...

28:39.100 --> 28:41.683
Guys.

28:42.058 --> 28:46.225
-Have you seen Jake?
-No.

28:49.058 --> 28:50.558
Focus now.

28:56.892 --> 28:59.433
There he is.

29:00.767 --> 29:04.808
He bought the puppy to me.

29:15.808 --> 29:18.308
How could he?

29:20.267 --> 29:24.225
What happened? Did you know?
Hello?

29:24.350 --> 29:27.892
-He does not want me.
-He's gay.

29:28.017 --> 29:32.850
No, he just loves Jesus.
-Come on, Sue.

29:32.975 --> 29:37.225
You liked him just to
there was something position.

29:38.058 --> 29:42.600
In order to determine which
man you want ...

29:42.725 --> 29:47.850
... You need to find out what
you are the kind of woman deep inside.

29:48.017 --> 29:53.475
Follow me ...
to face your dark side.

29:58.558 --> 30:02.308
Out! Out, all of you!

30:09.517 --> 30:15.600
It's time for you
to meet your vagina.

30:24.892 --> 30:31.392
-I can not. I can not stand.
-You do not have to not print until you looked.

30:33.850 --> 30:36.600
Sue? Do you see it?

30:37.017 --> 30:39.308
Sue?

30:41.433 --> 30:45.225
I'm almost there.

30:49.183 --> 30:54.225
What is it? What did you see?

30:54.350 --> 31:00.892
-A raccoon.
-Align the mirror further up.

31:06.767 --> 31:11.767
-I can not. Do not make me.
-All right.

31:11.892 --> 31:18.183
You leave me no choice.
You need an orgasm.

31:18.267 --> 31:23.850
How can you have sex with someone else
when you have not had it to yourself?

31:23.975 --> 31:25.767
It is the first step.

31:25.892 --> 31:28.350
I'm done, Lex.

31:28.475 --> 31:32.892
Find my black vibrator
top dresser drawer. Use it.

31:33.017 --> 31:38.683
How does it look?
-It is black and vibrates.

31:39.183 --> 31:43.433
Come on, Rod. We go to Sue's room.

31:43.558 --> 31:47.600
Do not come back before
had at least one orgasm.

31:54.892 --> 31:58.183
Hey, sweetie!

32:01.308 --> 32:04.433
In the middle of the planet!

32:08.392 --> 32:10.767
Lie!

32:10.892 --> 32:15.267
Stand up!

32:16.100 --> 32:18.892
He can be over a hundred commands.

32:19.058 --> 32:24.142
-Sorry, I can not see.
-It was not fun.

32:25.183 --> 32:29.267
You become accustomed to things
when one is blind.

32:54.808 --> 32:57.642
Damn!

33:00.725 --> 33:03.767
What's wrong with it?

33:03.892 --> 33:07.475
Nice shot.
Right on target.

33:17.683 --> 33:22.183
-What is it?
It's Jake.

33:22.267 --> 33:27.183
He was sucked by
a girl with pink hair.

33:27.267 --> 33:31.058
I have refused him sex
so it's probably my fault.

33:31.183 --> 33:34.183
There is no excuse.
He's a shit.

33:34.267 --> 33:40.100
I know. I thought
that we would get married.

33:42.558 --> 33:48.225
It's a mess from him.
I can not stand to read it.

33:48.350 --> 33:52.225
He's looking for you.
He wants to give you your birthday present.

33:52.350 --> 33:57.558
-I can not stand. I'm out.
-You can not just leave.

33:57.683 --> 34:02.725
I can not pretend as if nothing happened.
Maybe I should confront him?

34:02.850 --> 34:06.767
Deny or make him promise
not to do it again. Both suck.

34:06.892 --> 34:13.850
There is only one
possible alternative ... Hämndsex.

34:14.641 --> 34:19.350
Find someone who you fuck the shit out of,
and make sure that Jake will be on you.

34:19.475 --> 34:24.808
He does not.
He's inside the other girls.

34:24.933 --> 34:29.766
He cares. This is the
worst thing you can do to his ego.

34:29.891 --> 34:34.433
Fuck someone else, when you
have not even slept with him.

34:34.558 --> 34:39.183
Especially if it's someone smarter,
prettier and with more cock.

34:40.016 --> 34:45.766
No, I can not. There are
No one is prettier and smarter.

34:45.933 --> 34:50.225
-Eric, he's perfect.
-Eric Hall? Are you kidding?

34:50.308 --> 34:55.225
He do like your type.
-What is it like, then?

34:55.308 --> 34:58.558
-Slutty.
-Yep.

34:58.683 --> 35:02.725
He is fantastic. I've necked
with him. He has a tongue ring.

35:02.850 --> 35:08.058
I can not make out with someone
that you made out with.

35:08.225 --> 35:13.767
Find someone else, then?
Someone I have not made out with.

35:16.058 --> 35:20.267
Whatever! You should not
marry him.

35:20.850 --> 35:23.350
No, I can not.

35:23.475 --> 35:27.308
If you want to live with that
you blew the chance-

35:27.433 --> 35:33.225
-To get your boyfriend to feel
worthless and hurt him for life-

35:33.350 --> 35:39.642
And you chose not to do it?
How can you live with it?

35:40.142 --> 35:44.517
I do not know.
-Trust me. It will work.

35:49.267 --> 35:52.267
I'll be sure to get
Jake me up.

35:52.933 --> 35:56.100
Hi, Cheryl.
-Nothing snack now.

36:07.350 --> 36:10.850
Hey. Congrats.

36:11.892 --> 36:14.183
Thank you.

36:33.350 --> 36:36.225
Have you seen Jake?

36:39.183 --> 36:43.183
Happy birthday.

36:44.517 --> 36:50.517
Most people think "Happy Birthday" is
from England. It is from the States.

36:51.433 --> 36:56.975
-From America. The United States?
I know where we live.

36:57.100 --> 37:00.183
Yes, of course.

37:03.183 --> 37:08.225
Are you going to grab it, right?
What do you want me to take hold of?

37:08.808 --> 37:12.308
It does not matter.

37:21.767 --> 37:23.975
Jake?

37:25.183 --> 37:31.017
You want to do it, or not?
-Excuse me? "It"?

37:31.142 --> 37:36.183
By dipping into the pot, flowers and bees ...

37:36.267 --> 37:40.225
-Be a little naughty.
-Oh, you mean ...

37:42.225 --> 37:47.433
-Now, at once?
Yes, the sooner the better.

37:48.100 --> 37:53.183
Yes, of course.
I realized that you just can not ...

37:53.267 --> 37:57.475
I mean ...

37:58.725 --> 38:02.642
It's just that you're so ...

38:03.517 --> 38:06.767
You are so beautiful.

38:07.017 --> 38:12.558
-Lnga kisses.
Okay, obviously. Sorry.

38:14.933 --> 38:19.850
Do you want to beat me up?

38:22.017 --> 38:27.308
You are wrapped like a pasty,
or some food residue on the pasta.

38:27.433 --> 38:34.225
Not that you're like some
leftovers. You are fresh, organic.

38:35.767 --> 38:39.142
Are you going to start?
-Okay.

38:40.100 --> 38:45.517
-Where is ...?
-The end is here somewhere.

38:46.142 --> 38:49.600
Let me just.

38:49.850 --> 38:55.392
I'm sorry.
-It does not matter. Try again.

38:56.142 --> 39:01.933
-I bite my nails.
-I lie on the bed.

39:09.017 --> 39:13.183
Let me see ... Here it is.

39:20.100 --> 39:24.058
Jeez! Cheryl? Are you okay?

39:26.892 --> 39:29.850
Are you okay?

39:29.975 --> 39:33.058
Jeez! So there.

39:37.308 --> 39:42.225
-It was stupid.
-Yes.

39:44.475 --> 39:47.558
What's up? Are you having fun?

39:48.183 --> 39:54.683
-Jake. I think I saw Cheryl upstairs.
What? I can not hear you.

39:54.808 --> 40:00.558
-A beer. The chips are so salty.
-Jake, you're up.

40:01.767 --> 40:05.725
I have to pee.
I've been drinking so much beer.

40:32.558 --> 40:36.392
Finally. I'll draw again.

40:36.725 --> 40:41.183
No, no, no. Ignore it.

40:41.267 --> 40:45.433
I want us to see each other.

40:45.558 --> 40:48.475
Okay, then.

41:20.725 --> 41:23.558
You like that, huh?

41:37.392 --> 41:40.392
What do you do?

41:40.517 --> 41:45.683
I think it's time ...
to do "it".

41:46.517 --> 41:50.017
Not yet. Longer foreplay.

42:00.267 --> 42:03.017
Oh, what a relief.

42:05.392 --> 42:08.642
My jaw.

42:08.767 --> 42:12.892
What is it?

42:13.058 --> 42:16.683
-Jaw is locked up.
Can it happen?

42:16.808 --> 42:19.850
I do not know.

42:19.975 --> 42:23.058
Are you okay?

42:23.933 --> 42:28.558
Never mind.
It's just a little embarrassing.

42:28.683 --> 42:34.767
It's probably TMJ syndrome,
or some fracture.

42:35.267 --> 42:38.517
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Do not worry.

42:38.642 --> 42:41.308
Okay, have fun.

42:54.017 --> 42:58.433
Can we do it now?
No, not yet.

42:59.892 --> 43:03.808
-I will.
No, no, no ...

43:04.850 --> 43:08.183
Not yet. Lexi!

43:09.350 --> 43:13.475
-No means no.
-Oh, forgive me.

43:13.642 --> 43:17.933
It was a long time ago and
I have not masturbated.

43:23.683 --> 43:26.183
Hey, Jake!

43:30.142 --> 43:35.183
Eric! Eric, I can not see anything.

43:39.767 --> 43:42.642
Cheryl is here.

43:45.725 --> 43:49.267
-What's up, buddy?
-What the hell!

43:50.142 --> 43:52.392
Wait!

43:52.517 --> 43:56.642
Lex, I am still waiting.

44:00.767 --> 44:04.058
Sorry, I do not see anything. I'm blind.

44:05.683 --> 44:09.725
Damn, I'm going to talk
with that bitch.

44:09.850 --> 44:15.392
Stop making fun of you blind,
or I'll teach you a lesson.

44:17.725 --> 44:22.350
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll never do it again.

44:36.558 --> 44:41.017
-Water balloons feels completely genuine.
They're real, bitch.

44:41.142 --> 44:44.892
-Excuse me.
-Ldiot.

44:51.725 --> 44:54.183
This is not working.

45:11.058 --> 45:16.142
End of vattenballoger.
What a crappy party.

45:21.267 --> 45:27.267
This is not working. What is
what is so great about vibrators?

45:30.267 --> 45:35.725
Be careful. The lock is messy.

45:37.392 --> 45:43.475
Damn, I love this game.
Where are the controls?

45:48.892 --> 45:51.642
Check out!

45:52.225 --> 45:54.475
-Come on!
-Remove it there.

46:02.808 --> 46:07.600
-Nice shot.
-It was not me.

46:10.558 --> 46:15.433
-Nice!
-Are you sitting on it?

46:16.892 --> 46:20.350
You have found the grenades.

46:30.767 --> 46:34.267
Do you have the second check?

46:45.475 --> 46:51.475
-You're control.
No, I ...

46:59.850 --> 47:02.600
Where is Sue.

47:04.808 --> 47:07.267
Wait, Sue.

47:17.017 --> 47:21.433
-Did not you hear me calling?
-Well, I had to ...

47:21.558 --> 47:28.058
Of course. You, Sue ... I
thinking about what I said earlier.

47:28.725 --> 47:32.850
-Have you? Do you mean ...
-Yes.

47:35.933 --> 47:41.683
Shall we give it a try?
Shall we take anything to drink?

47:43.850 --> 47:48.558
The toilet is clogged.
You should ...

47:48.683 --> 47:54.183
-I have to wedge ... Happy birthday.
No, Chris.

47:54.308 --> 47:57.433
Never mind.

48:07.600 --> 48:12.017
This was the worst idea ever.
I will never have sex.

48:12.558 --> 48:14.517
Oops.

48:29.683 --> 48:34.767
-Hello? Can I get some attention?
Yeah, sorry.

48:39.933 --> 48:44.433
-Do not be selfish, Lex.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

48:56.642 --> 49:03.225
Who came up with this stupid situation?
There are too many balls in the air.

49:03.350 --> 49:07.225
Fuck that. Let's do it alone.

49:16.683 --> 49:19.850
This is it.

49:22.808 --> 49:28.725
-What is it?
I can not get into it.

49:30.933 --> 49:36.767
-Do not force it.
-We were so horny last week.

49:36.892 --> 49:41.225
What is the difference?
How could this happen?

49:41.308 --> 49:44.600
JJ was the last time.

49:45.142 --> 49:48.517
Oh yes, JJ.

49:48.808 --> 49:53.975
Oh, no! No!

49:54.100 --> 49:58.642
I'm such a slut who
need a threesome to light?

49:58.767 --> 50:03.225
I have become completely parched.
As a pressed orange.

50:09.183 --> 50:14.183
Is JJ tonight?
-Not that I know of.

50:14.267 --> 50:19.058
It does not matter.
We do not need a third party.

50:19.183 --> 50:22.267
We just need a little ...

50:23.267 --> 50:28.767
I have this edible massage oil.
You can lubricate it.

50:37.683 --> 50:40.350
Are you ready?

50:40.475 --> 50:45.683
What the hell was that?
It hurts!

50:50.850 --> 50:55.975
No! The lip product.

50:56.100 --> 51:00.100
No wonder that
his lips were not large.

51:02.267 --> 51:06.475
Ouch, that hurts.

51:50.142 --> 51:54.225
It was not good.

52:03.933 --> 52:06.933
Joanna, do you know anyone JJ?

52:09.100 --> 52:12.350
His name starts with J.

52:14.267 --> 52:19.392
-Begin your name on J?
Yes, it does.

52:20.017 --> 52:23.225
-Are you JJ?
-No.

52:33.767 --> 52:37.683
<i> Do you feel guilt? Do you confess? </ I></i>

52:44.433 --> 52:50.267
-Confession Line. A priest or a nun?
-A nun.

52:50.350 --> 52:53.808
Dial the number on your credit card.

52:57.808 --> 53:00.683
Please wait.

53:02.767 --> 53:07.975
Confession-line, at your service.
-It was a day since I confessed to me.

53:08.100 --> 53:12.392
I blame myself
for the following sins:

53:15.142 --> 53:18.225
I would have confessed me today,
but it is my 18th birthday.

53:18.350 --> 53:24.267
-Continue.
-I have caressed me obscene.

53:24.392 --> 53:27.933
No, it was a washing machine.
-What is her problem?

53:28.100 --> 53:31.683
A washing machine has caressed her.

53:32.433 --> 53:37.142
I'm sitting on a washing machine ...
-Time's up, stupid.

53:37.267 --> 53:40.642
What should I do?
-Replace the handset.

53:40.767 --> 53:47.475
-I think I got an orgasm.
-Be glad for it.

53:47.600 --> 53:52.517
I'm serious.
-You seem like a nice young lady.

53:52.642 --> 53:59.017
It's no sin to masturbate.
-Nothing punishment?

53:59.142 --> 54:02.767
You have not violated God's rules.

54:02.892 --> 54:08.642
Can the washing machine fondling
me at any time?

54:08.808 --> 54:14.267
Yes, and other things too.
Inadvertent masturbation is not a sin.

54:14.392 --> 54:17.142
Not even intentional.

54:18.392 --> 54:22.933
-God is pretty cool with that.
-It is he really.

54:25.142 --> 54:31.933
-How do you know all that?
-I am a nun. Lick me, bitch!

54:33.392 --> 54:36.142
Inadvertent masturbation.
Who'd have thought it?

54:42.433 --> 54:48.350
Hämndsex was the stupidest ...
I'm out of here.

54:49.933 --> 54:52.808
I admit it.
I play no games.

54:52.933 --> 54:56.558
I'm just a little nervous when I
hits such beautiful girls.

54:59.058 --> 55:02.225
Fucking asshole.

55:03.142 --> 55:07.475
-I just have to lie.
Come on, babe.

55:09.517 --> 55:13.767
-What are you doing here?
-We wanted to be ourselves.

55:13.933 --> 55:17.267
If you are serious.

55:17.392 --> 55:21.850
If you want someone who is good.
By that I mean the absolute best ...

55:22.933 --> 55:27.683
No offense.
Frank, the blind guy.

55:27.808 --> 55:31.558
He is incredible.

55:31.683 --> 55:36.142
I was with him for a while since I
've never seen anything like it.

55:36.267 --> 55:41.975
We used all our senses.

55:42.100 --> 55:47.058
I can arrange it for you.
-Okay.

55:50.392 --> 55:54.350
He, then? Jeremy?
-I know him.

55:54.517 --> 55:59.892
I think I've made out with him.
I do not know what his name is the surname.

56:00.017 --> 56:06.433
-Jones. Jeremy Jones
-Now I begin to understand.

56:09.850 --> 56:14.808
-Who was that?
-My new girlfriend. She comes late.

56:14.975 --> 56:18.558
Do you have girlfriend?

56:30.017 --> 56:33.308
Hey, Frank!
-Sit!

56:36.933 --> 56:40.767
Oh, you meant ... the dog.

56:41.225 --> 56:45.975
Take it easy. You must tag down.

56:54.892 --> 56:59.267
I'm calm.
-Why do you bite your nails?

56:59.392 --> 57:02.558
I do not.

57:03.017 --> 57:08.142
-How did you know?
-Corner!

57:10.725 --> 57:14.850
Sit! Roll around!

57:16.683 --> 57:23.392
-Did you mean me? How do you ...?
-Lie only.

57:34.642 --> 57:41.142
I should not do it, but with
Given that you are going to learn something ...

57:46.267 --> 57:49.225
See me with your hands.

57:51.142 --> 57:54.183
Okay ...

57:58.933 --> 58:03.600
I have boyfriend. I should not ...

58:15.683 --> 58:18.767
Mmm, peanut butter.

58:31.183 --> 58:33.808
Kanon.

58:36.267 --> 58:38.892
Oh, great.

58:41.058 --> 58:45.100
-Can I taste it?
It's my chips.

58:45.225 --> 58:48.808
Come on, I get a taste!
It's my chips.

58:50.683 --> 58:52.517
My chips!

58:52.683 --> 58:57.308
Why pigs you so?
-Excuse me.

59:03.558 --> 59:07.475
It was just a little inadvertent masturbation.

59:11.225 --> 59:15.558
I can do it. I want to help.

59:18.683 --> 59:22.558
Out, all of you!
I have to vacuum.

59:35.267 --> 59:42.017
-The chips here.
-I see a little dust here.

59:44.558 --> 59:47.392
There is so much dust on the floor.

59:47.558 --> 59:54.850
It is a dirty floor.
One of those filthy, filthy floors.

01:00:11.183 --> 01:00:14.017
Okay ...

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.600
I got fed up with everything.
We'll see.

01:00:25.558 --> 01:00:29.475
-Frankie then ...
-What was that?

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.142
What?

01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:35.142
We can smoke in here.

01:00:37.142 --> 01:00:40.225
Stop teasing, Frank!

01:00:40.933 --> 01:00:44.975
-Trapped in a box!
-We are a place where we can smoke.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.808
-I heard something so ...
-Do you smoke ...? Come on now ...

01:00:51.183 --> 01:00:54.350
-I must return.
Where's the pooch?

01:00:58.892 --> 01:01:02.475
Frank?
Should we do something, right?

01:01:03.808 --> 01:01:06.975
Come on, Frank!
Come here!

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.142
Come! Come here!

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:15.392
Yes, lick it up!
Lick it all up, Frank!

01:01:15.517 --> 01:01:19.475
Yes, come on!

01:01:21.308 --> 01:01:24.892
You tickles! Oh, Frank!

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.350
Yeah, lick, Frank!

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:36.517
-You are too funny, dude.
Thank you. It was schyst smoke.

01:01:36.642 --> 01:01:42.017
I have not smoked since high school.
-I have not stopped since high school.

01:01:42.517 --> 01:01:46.183
I feel like I should do something.

01:01:46.683 --> 01:01:50.183
I do not remember. It was good stuff.

01:01:51.183 --> 01:01:57.225
I can not do more.
You are so crazy, Frankie!

01:01:59.392 --> 01:02:05.225
That's not true!
-Come here, buster!

01:02:06.017 --> 01:02:12.892
It's not true!
This is insane!

01:02:14.892 --> 01:02:19.267
I can be your dog.

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.975
What is it?

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.142
Jeez!

01:02:32.517 --> 01:02:35.183
Doggie style!

01:02:37.017 --> 01:02:41.225
Get out of here!

01:02:41.433 --> 01:02:44.392
Get out of here! Out!

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.100
Fyfan!

01:03:05.975 --> 01:03:10.183
Oh, no. You are the devil.
I can not do more.

01:03:11.767 --> 01:03:15.433
It is a terrible mistake.
You are a good person.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:19.933
Not some slutty masturbator.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.225
You're better than that.

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:31.183
Never again.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:36.767
No, no.
Not more, please!

01:03:38.058 --> 01:03:40.350
I can not stop.

01:03:43.517 --> 01:03:45.642
I'm a bad person.

01:03:46.433 --> 01:03:49.975
Twelve different speeds.

01:04:13.142 --> 01:04:17.683
You disgust me.
I must here.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:26.725
JJ ... Jeremy. Do not you remember what
nice time we had together?

01:04:26.975 --> 01:04:30.725
-Please?
-Lex, I do not remember.

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:35.058
-I have a girlfriend that I like.
Okay then.

01:04:35.183 --> 01:04:39.517
It's just so sad,
because I'm wearing a bra kuplös.

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:42.933
I have also panties without branch

01:04:43.058 --> 01:04:47.933
-With little beads for extra stimulation.

01:04:53.433 --> 01:04:56.517
We have 30 minutes
us before she comes.

01:05:06.808 --> 01:05:10.600
Let's do it.
Fuck me!

01:05:14.183 --> 01:05:20.642
-What's wrong?
-I do not get it. You are too dry.

01:05:20.767 --> 01:05:26.017
It's like sandpaper.
-I get it.

01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:31.892
Try again.
No, why is this happening?

01:05:32.017 --> 01:05:36.600
I was dripping wet last time.
I came Fya times. Do not you remember?

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:41.933
-Do as you did then.
-I have already run my thing.

01:05:42.058 --> 01:05:48.225
-What's wrong?
I do not know. The last time ...

01:05:50.433 --> 01:05:54.642
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:05:54.808 --> 01:06:00.933
If you are not JJ? You called the
Jeremy Jones. You must be JJ.

01:06:01.392 --> 01:06:06.850
Who is JJ?
Where are you? We're not done.

01:06:07.017 --> 01:06:10.142
I can do it.
I just need more foreplay.

01:06:10.267 --> 01:06:14.808
I do not need JJ.
I need no other. We stuff it.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.642
-We are a super-low.
-You ... you ...

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:23.267
Huh? Carry on.

01:06:25.183 --> 01:06:29.600
-Are you there, Jeremy?
-Wait a minute.

01:06:29.725 --> 01:06:32.100
Jeremy?

01:06:37.267 --> 01:06:41.642
Where's Jeremy?
-We just ... gymmar bit.

01:06:43.058 --> 01:06:46.308
Hello, darling. I gymmar.

01:06:48.933 --> 01:06:52.517
How could you, you bastard?

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.308
-Maybe you should ...
-What?

01:07:01.725 --> 01:07:04.642
Mariella!

01:07:04.767 --> 01:07:09.558
Those were not mine.
Not all anyway.

01:07:09.683 --> 01:07:13.225
What is wrong with you?

01:07:14.808 --> 01:07:19.433
What is wrong with you?
You used to be so chaste.

01:07:19.558 --> 01:07:23.808
That's it.
That was the last time.

01:08:01.808 --> 01:08:04.558
Cheryl?

01:08:06.767 --> 01:08:09.933
What is it?
What are you doing here?

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:16.100
I'm waiting for everyone to stand
so that I can pull far away.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:20.433
That blind man and his dog ...

01:08:20.558 --> 01:08:25.642
-It will be good.
No, it does not.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:31.475
Do you know whose fault it is ...?
It is Jakes error.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.767
-The lying bastard.
He is a moron! Confront him.

01:08:37.892 --> 01:08:43.475
Yes, I will.
It's my birthday and where is he?

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.225
-Why is not he with me?
-Call him and tell me what you think.

01:08:48.308 --> 01:08:54.142
I should really say what I think.

01:08:54.267 --> 01:08:59.850
Maybe you should ...
You need to look sexy when you make the final.

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.392
I should not have a blanket on me.

01:09:08.433 --> 01:09:14.475
Forgive me. I get so shy when
I am with beautiful women.

01:09:16.267 --> 01:09:19.433
I play no games.

01:09:23.933 --> 01:09:26.058
There was nothing important.

01:09:35.142 --> 01:09:39.267
-I can not talk now.
-I need to talk to you.

01:09:39.392 --> 01:09:45.350
-I can not.
-I just want to apologize.

01:09:45.475 --> 01:09:50.433
-I am ashamed and want to make amends to you.
-It is not necessary. It's cool.

01:09:50.558 --> 01:09:55.350
I care.

01:09:55.475 --> 01:09:59.933
I have not told it.
I am very shy.

01:10:00.058 --> 01:10:06.558
But I wonder and hope
if we could hang out sometime.

01:10:06.683 --> 01:10:11.683
Soon. I'm going away for a while
and it would be fun to do it before.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:17.725
-You are shy and do not play any games, right?
-In a way.

01:10:18.558 --> 01:10:21.808
I can not do this.

01:10:24.017 --> 01:10:25.933
Okay, then.

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:32.183
Happy birthday.

01:10:40.933 --> 01:10:44.475
I'm sorry. I tried to kiss you.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.225
Are you ready for the surprise?

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:23.808
Now you can make a luminous
copy of my penis.

01:11:23.933 --> 01:11:26.725
She will love it here.

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:34.933
-We can not do this.
-Not again.

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:37.433
Gratt ...

01:11:38.058 --> 01:11:41.142
What the hell is this?
Who the hell are you?

01:11:41.267 --> 01:11:44.225
Nothing fights now.

01:11:45.517 --> 01:11:49.642
Honey, what is this?

01:11:50.183 --> 01:11:55.683
Cher ... I've been looking for you all
evening and you have ...

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:59.558
No wonder that I did not find you.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:04.600
All girls snippor you been, then?
Or that you have been sucked?

01:12:04.725 --> 01:12:09.267
Cheryl, we can do this.
I love you.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:13.225
-Jake, you gotta go.
-Please, I promise to be faithful.

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:17.350
No, Jake. I'm sorry.
-Come on, Cheryl.

01:12:17.475 --> 01:12:20.267
Stop it, Jake. I'm sorry.

01:12:20.392 --> 01:12:23.808
You are a callous bitch!

01:12:24.558 --> 01:12:30.433
You did it. You got your hämndsex.
You left a fragment of a man.

01:12:30.558 --> 01:12:35.642
-Hämndsex?
It's not as bad as it sounds.

01:12:35.767 --> 01:12:40.308
No, but now it begins to dawn on me.

01:12:40.433 --> 01:12:46.517
-I feel really stupid.
I'm really sorry, Eric.

01:12:46.683 --> 01:12:51.350
I liked you
and you used me.

01:12:51.475 --> 01:12:54.350
Do not go, please!

01:12:55.558 --> 01:13:00.767
-Are you not satisfied?
That's not how it would feel.

01:13:00.933 --> 01:13:06.475
-Where sex is not ...?
-We did not do it directly.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.975
Me neither. I found
not the right guy or guys.

01:13:13.225 --> 01:13:18.683
We must go down before people start going
homes. Wondering what happened to Sue?

01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:28.600
-A little more water balloons?
Yes, yes, yes.

01:13:30.142 --> 01:13:33.892
I can not believe she dumped me.

01:13:36.392 --> 01:13:38.225
Suck on that!

01:13:39.183 --> 01:13:41.392
I draw!

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:44.392
He had good mistress.

01:13:47.058 --> 01:13:51.183
Spy is not down to me.
Spy is not in the car either.

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:05.975
How are you, Sue?

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:11.683
Is it sex? Were you with mödisen?
-Not with some guy, anyway.

01:14:12.058 --> 01:14:19.183
I have used all mechanical
tools I could find.

01:14:19.308 --> 01:14:25.725
-All things were made vibrators.
It's addictive.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:29.683
-What happened to Chris?
-He put his leg.

01:14:29.808 --> 01:14:36.642
-I told you he was gay.
I'm gonna ... Ouch, cramp.

01:14:37.308 --> 01:14:43.767
-I think something is broken.
-None of us did it.

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:51.850
Thank you, Joanna.
-I was going to eat some. Linked you on?

01:14:51.975 --> 01:14:56.183
No, I will disclose finished here.

01:14:56.267 --> 01:14:59.892
-Did the guy you were looking for?
-No.

01:15:00.058 --> 01:15:06.183
No, but I realized that
he must be my first type.

01:15:06.267 --> 01:15:09.808
-Why, do you know him?
-In a way.

01:15:09.933 --> 01:15:15.058
If you meet him,
health that I want to see you again.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:24.517
-You love him.
-Shut up!

01:15:49.933 --> 01:15:52.558
Not a chance.

01:16:07.683 --> 01:16:11.100
It may be next year.

01:16:30.183 --> 01:16:35.433
Is that you?
I've been waiting for you ... JJ.

01:16:37.892 --> 01:16:40.225
-Joanna?
-Mm.

01:17:40.392 --> 01:17:43.433
I want you ... now.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:09.850
So this means that I'm flat.

01:18:10.933 --> 01:18:16.642
Wait a minute. I do not know.
I'm not sure about this.

01:18:19.767 --> 01:18:23.933
Wait! I'm sorry, but ...

01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:28.808
I think we should do it again,
to be on the safe side.

01:18:52.017 --> 01:18:55.225
-Wow!
-Absolutely incredible.

01:18:56.475 --> 01:19:01.975
I did not know I had it in
Me. Something must have inspired me.

01:19:02.767 --> 01:19:09.517
You've captured his expression.
-Even the small detail of his hairstyle.

01:19:11.017 --> 01:19:16.183
-Whose?
-Eric. Is that him?

01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:21.808
Oops! Yes. I need to see him.

01:19:26.017 --> 01:19:29.808
I think you know what to do.

01:19:39.017 --> 01:19:43.892
Biktarlinjen? - Sister Therese?

01:19:44.017 --> 01:19:49.433
Yes, there was a problem with the credit card.
I need the last three digits.

01:19:49.558 --> 01:19:54.433
Sure. It is the 271st

01:19:54.558 --> 01:19:59.058
I know that this is not someone's confession,
but may I ask for some advice?

01:19:59.183 --> 01:20:05.225
Will God forgive the
doing something bad?

01:20:05.308 --> 01:20:10.142
Yes, why not, darling. As long as
you're on the right path.

01:20:10.267 --> 01:20:16.975
-How do you know that?
I'm always looking for a sign.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:21.058
Something that makes me know that
everything will be fine.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:25.683
Sister, I get to travel with me?
I have to pee.

01:20:25.808 --> 01:20:29.142
No, keep your mouth!

01:20:29.267 --> 01:20:34.225
I have to work, honey.
Call any time.

01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:37.058
Thank you.

01:20:38.725 --> 01:20:43.308
-Sister?
-Shut up, otherwise you whip!

01:20:57.308 --> 01:21:00.100
Wait, Eric!

01:21:01.017 --> 01:21:03.058
Cheryl?

01:21:03.975 --> 01:21:09.392
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:21:09.517 --> 01:21:13.808
I tried to have hämndsex with
you in the beginning, not the end.

01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:21.517
I did not want hämndsex with you;
without real sex.

01:21:21.975 --> 01:21:28.392
I want to hang with you.
I did not realize it until this morning.

01:21:29.392 --> 01:21:33.433
-You are quite different from Jake.
-Eric!

01:21:34.892 --> 01:21:39.183
-We have to go now.
-Oops.

01:21:39.267 --> 01:21:43.392
Cheryl, this is my sister Tina.
Tina, Cheryl.

01:21:43.517 --> 01:21:48.308
Hello, nice to meet you.

01:21:49.808 --> 01:21:54.183
Can I call you
when I come back?

01:21:55.142 --> 01:21:57.267
Sure.

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:06.683
-Nothing kissing, right?
-Well, kiss me.

01:22:22.017 --> 01:22:25.267
Did you get the flowers I sent?

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:32.850
-I do not care that you have been with Lexi.
-I have not.

01:22:32.975 --> 01:22:37.683
You do not lie.
She told me about your pierced tongue.

01:22:41.517 --> 01:22:44.517
She must have mixed
me up with someone else.

01:22:44.642 --> 01:22:47.392
Who could it have been?

01:22:56.475 --> 01:23:01.767
What is it?
Have tongue ring stuck again?

01:23:03.058 --> 01:23:09.683
It's nothing. Take your time.
I'm starting to get close to my record.

01:23:17.017 --> 01:23:20.225
Birthday is certainly over.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:37.433
Dear Lord, forgive me.
If you could just give me a sign.

01:24:07.058 --> 01:24:11.933
Excuse me? Do you know where the church
at Fountain Street is?

01:24:13.558 --> 01:24:17.475
Yes, it is the church I go to,
or used to go to.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:24.558
-Straight ahead and then to the left.
Thank you. Want to join me?

01:24:24.683 --> 01:24:29.225
I do not know.

01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:41.642
-It's pretty powerful, right?
-250 Hp, 225 ft of torque.

01:24:41.767 --> 01:24:48.767
-Feel free to hang on.
-I do not think so. Thanks anyway.

01:24:48.933 --> 01:24:51.558
-What is your name?
-Sue. What is your name?

01:24:51.683 --> 01:24:56.808
-Jesus
Is that true?

01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.558
Maybe I can hang on a tour.

01:25:29.163 --> 01:25:33.163
