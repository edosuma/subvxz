An anniversary brunch.

but your father, he doesn't
care about anniversaries.

11:13.772 --> 11:16.707
Well, I knew we had
a couple of pinkos
in this house,

11:16.775 --> 11:18.709
but I didn't know
we had atheists !

11:18.777 --> 11:21.712
Did you know that, Edith,
that we had a pair of
atheists under this roof ?

11:21.780 --> 11:24.548
Well, maybe if we could just
eat a little somethin'--

11:24.616 --> 11:27.551
will you stifle,
you silly dingbat !

11:27.619 --> 11:29.553
I don't want
no more arguments.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.555
We are not arguin'.
We're discussin'.

11:31.623 --> 11:34.558
I don't care what you call it.
It's still arguing.

11:34.626 --> 11:37.561
We're having what we
always have around here--
a discussion.

11:37.629 --> 11:40.564
I don't see the difference.
That's 'cause
you're a dingbat.

11:41.733 --> 11:44.669
And get that ridiculous hat
off your head !

11:44.736 --> 11:47.338
Will you
stay out of this.
So long as you don't argue.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.674
Edith, stay the hell
out of this !

11:49.741 --> 11:51.676
Aaah !

11:51.743 --> 11:54.178
What's the matter ?
Get away from me,
you meathead !

11:54.245 --> 11:57.181
It's all your fault !
You nearly burnt
the hand off me !

11:57.248 --> 11:59.183
Well, what did he do ?

11:59.250 --> 12:02.687
He helps himself to coffee,
then he turns the handle
around the other way.

12:02.754 --> 12:05.189
Oh, daddy,
he didn't do it
on purpose.

12:05.256 --> 12:08.526
Well, let me see.
It really hurts, huh ?
Yeah.

12:08.593 --> 12:10.528
Right about in there ?
Yeah.

12:10.595 --> 12:13.531
You know what I think
we oughta do ?
What do you think ?

12:13.598 --> 12:15.533
I think we oughta eat.

12:22.273 --> 12:24.542
Give me over
the ketchup there.

12:24.609 --> 12:26.544
Ketchup on eggs ?
Daddy, really.

12:26.611 --> 12:29.547
"Daddy, really"
has been eatin'
ketchup on eggs...

12:29.614 --> 12:31.882
Since before
you was born,
little girl.

[ Burps ]

12:48.533 --> 12:51.635
Oh, Archie,
that's terrible.

12:53.605 --> 12:56.039
Well,
who's for more eggs ?

12:56.107 --> 12:58.041
Sure I can't
help you, dear ?

12:58.109 --> 13:00.043
Not today, mom.
Today you sit.

13:00.111 --> 13:02.813
If I need any help,
Michael can do it.

13:02.881 --> 13:04.815
It won't do him no harm,
neither.

13:04.883 --> 13:08.719
The last time I seen him
liftin' a hand around here,
he was testin' his deodorant.

13:10.121 --> 13:13.457
Mom !
Oh, Archie,
leave him alone.

13:13.525 --> 13:16.960
What do you want from me ?
I don't have time
to do anything.

13:17.028 --> 13:21.331
I'm studying six hours,
I'm in class six hours.
Going to college is hard work.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.334
For you, it's like
buildin' the pyramids.

13:24.403 --> 13:29.339
All that sociology
and studyin' that welfare stuff,
I don't call that no hard work.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.341
Oh, daddy,
leave him alone.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.645
I think it's beautiful
that Michael wants to help
the underprivileged.

13:34.713 --> 13:38.649
Listen, if he wants
to help the underprivileged,
let him start with himself.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.651
He's got no brains,
no ambition.

13:40.719 --> 13:43.353
If that ain't underprivileged,
I don't know what is.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.355
That's it !

13:45.424 --> 13:47.357
Mother,
we're moving out of here.

13:47.426 --> 13:51.862
I'm not gonna stay in this house
another minute to see my husband
insulted like that !

13:51.930 --> 13:53.864
Archie,
say you're sorry.

13:53.932 --> 13:56.867
If she leaves here,
she'll be dead
inside a year.

You don't have to worry.
They ain't goin' nowhere.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.445
You don't know
what it is.

14:07.512 --> 14:09.447
She can't be cleanin'
an apartment...

14:09.514 --> 14:11.449
And cookin'
and marketing.

14:11.516 --> 14:13.951
Why, Dr. feinstein
says she's anemic.

14:14.018 --> 14:15.953
Don't give me that.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.956
For ten bucks, some of
these doctors'll tell you
anything you want to hear.

14:19.023 --> 14:21.959
He's the best there is
when it comes to blood.

14:22.026 --> 14:23.961
My cousin
from the hospital
said so.

14:24.028 --> 14:26.464
Your cousin
from the hospital
empties bedpans.

14:26.531 --> 14:28.966
Don't make him out
no specialist.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.570
I know what
Dr. feinberg said.

14:32.637 --> 14:35.072
Feinstein.
Feinstein.
Feinberg.

14:35.139 --> 14:37.575
It all comes
to the same thing,

that tribe.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.849

don't leave this house...

for her proper.

Oh, boy.

14:49.688 --> 14:53.591
Four years before I even
begin to make a living.
It seems like forever.

14:53.658 --> 14:57.962
Let me tell you, Sonny boy,

at least once a day.

Gloria, you married

15:02.634 --> 15:05.369
All right, it's bad enough
you gotta make fun of me.

15:05.436 --> 15:08.372
You don't have to make it worse
by attacking a whole race.

15:08.439 --> 15:10.173
Who's attackin'
a whole race ?

15:10.241 --> 15:13.243
You are. You just said
I was the laziest white man
you ever met.

15:13.311 --> 15:16.246
<i>What's the matter</i>
<i>with that ?</i>
<i>"White man you ever met."</i>

15:16.314 --> 15:19.149
- Yeah, <i>you.</i>
<i>- Implying that the blacks</i>
<i> are even lazier.</i>

15:19.217 --> 15:23.487
Wait a minute, meathead.
You said that, not me.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.991
I never said
your black beauties
was lazy.

15:27.058 --> 15:31.562
It's just their systems
is geared a little slower
than the rest of us, that's all.

15:32.898 --> 15:36.366
- Come on !
- You don't believe me,
look it up.

15:36.434 --> 15:38.368
There's just no fighting
this prejudice.

15:38.436 --> 15:41.071
There's no hope for him.
No hope at all.

15:41.139 --> 15:43.073
I'm not prejudiced.

15:43.141 --> 15:46.109
Any man deserves my respect,
he's gonna get it
regardless of his color.

15:46.177 --> 15:48.378
What do you call 'em
"black beauties" for ?

15:48.446 --> 15:50.881
Now, that's where I got you,
Mr. liberal.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.884
Because there's a black guy
that works down
at the building with me,

15:53.952 --> 15:56.887
and he's got
a bumper sticker
on his car that says,

15:56.955 --> 15:58.889
"black is beautiful."

15:58.957 --> 16:01.391
So what's the matter
with "black beauties" ?

16:04.495 --> 16:07.932
It's nicer than
when he called 'em
"coons."

16:11.736 --> 16:13.503
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>

16:13.572 --> 16:15.372

is kosher with them,
it's kosher with me.

Hey, Lionel.
Come on in.
How's it goin' ?

16:24.749 --> 16:27.517

just talking about you.

I wanna ask you,

16:49.240 --> 16:51.174
Let her open
her gift first.

I wanna ask your opinion
on somethin'.

17:00.184 --> 17:03.120

one of the first guys
to throw a little work
your way--

17:06.190 --> 17:08.791
by the way,
did you fix the tv ?
Sure did, Mr. bunker.

17:08.859 --> 17:11.795
That's swell. Good boy.
Here, put that
in your pocket.

17:11.863 --> 17:15.065
Cheaper than a repairman,
believe me.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.067
Is anybody
talkin' to you ?

17:17.135 --> 17:20.069
Now, Lionel, you could say,
by throwin' you
these little jobs,

17:20.137 --> 17:23.406
that I was helpin' you
get some money so you could
go to college and become--

where it's at.

Uh, I was just wondering,
Mr. bunker, what's with
the Jewish word ?

18:41.720 --> 18:45.488
Ah, well, I hear them.
We got a couple of hebes
workin' down at the building.

like that very often ?
Now and then.

to be one of them,
would you ?

18:59.804 --> 19:01.739
What ?

19:01.806 --> 19:05.242
Well, people don't use
Jewish words just like that,
do they, Mike ?

19:05.309 --> 19:07.244
No, not
in my experience.

19:07.311 --> 19:10.447
Maybe people don't,
but I do,
and I ain't no yid.

19:10.514 --> 19:15.119
Come to think of it, when your
father was visiting last year,
wasn't his name Davey--

19:15.186 --> 19:18.688
- my father's name was David.
- Right. And what was
your mother's name ?

19:18.757 --> 19:22.025
It was Sarah.
Yeah, my mother's name
was Sarah. So what ?

19:22.093 --> 19:25.695
Uh, David and Sarah.
Two Jewish names.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.698
David and Sarah--
two names right out
of the Bible.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.701
Which has got nothin'
to do with the Jews.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.605
Now, you don't want--

19:36.975 --> 19:39.409
you don't wanna get
uptight about it,
Mr. bunker.

19:39.477 --> 19:42.345
There's nothing to be
ashamed of, being Jewish.
But I ain't Jewish !

19:42.413 --> 19:46.349
Look at that.
See the way he uses his hands
when he argues ?

19:46.417 --> 19:48.852
Huh ?
Very semitic gesture.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.355

Jewish !

you was Jewish.

are you talkin' about ?

should <i>know</i>
<i>that I ain't Jewish.</i>

tend to be emotional.

I'm gonna give you this
once more, and that's all.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.628
I am not Jewish.
Yes, sir, Mr. bunker.

But even if you are,
it doesn't change things
between you and me.

over a little thing like that.

You know
what I'm gonna do ?

22:10.861 --> 22:12.796
I'm gonna try using one.

22:12.863 --> 22:15.299
You know,
see how I look with it.

22:15.366 --> 22:18.302
Some people don't look natural
with fancy things.

22:21.239 --> 22:23.640
Oh, you look wonderful,
mom !
Perfectly natural.

22:23.707 --> 22:26.643
Just don't blow in it.
It'll go right through.

22:26.710 --> 22:30.480
Oh, Archie, I just
don't know what to say.

22:30.548 --> 22:33.150
Except thank you,
sweetheart.

22:33.217 --> 22:35.819
Oh, I do thank you,
Archie dear.

22:35.886 --> 22:38.621
All right, all right, Edith.
You're gettin' me all wet.

22:38.689 --> 22:40.623

22:40.691 --> 22:42.625
Oh. Archie.
[ Giggles ]

22:42.693 --> 22:45.128
I'll bet it's a hallmark.

22:46.530 --> 22:48.465
Well, pretty near.

22:49.767 --> 22:52.202
Oh, there's a verse
inside.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.338
"Together."
Ohh.

22:55.906 --> 22:58.842
"Through all the years
I've been with you,

22:58.909 --> 23:01.845
"we've had our ups and downs,
'tis true.

23:01.912 --> 23:05.015
"But life with us
has just begun.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.517
"We've yet to have
all of our fun.

23:07.585 --> 23:10.020
As long as we're together."

23:18.496 --> 23:20.530
What are you lookin' at ?

23:20.598 --> 23:24.201
"And when, my dear,
we're old and gray,

23:24.268 --> 23:27.004
"and life for us
is sunny weather,

23:27.071 --> 23:30.407
"we'll look back on our lives
and say,

23:30.475 --> 23:34.577
it's been
a gay, gay lark together."

23:43.454 --> 23:46.390
All right, all right.

23:46.457 --> 23:50.894
The anniversary party's over.

and clean up the mess.

23:50.961 --> 23:54.064
Them eggs over there
is startin' to "foment."

23:54.132 --> 23:58.902
Oh, Archie, I--
I just don't know what to say.

23:58.969 --> 24:01.871

24:10.148 --> 24:13.083
Hey, do you have to
always be doin' that ?

24:13.151 --> 24:15.419
It's as if
she was a hamburger.

24:15.486 --> 24:17.421
Mom !

24:20.158 --> 24:22.259
The card kinda
got to you, huh ?

24:22.326 --> 24:25.929

It got to your mother-in-law.
- No, no, it got to you too.

24:25.996 --> 24:29.933
- I never knew you were
so soft and sentimental.
- You don't know much anyhow.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.436
I wanna tell you somethin'
about yourself.

24:32.503 --> 24:35.439
You are a person
of very little quality.

24:37.675 --> 24:40.610
You got no appreciation
for some of your finer things.

24:40.678 --> 24:43.913
What-- Archie,

a greeting card.

24:43.981 --> 24:47.317
They got some damn good writers
writin' for them cards.
Come on.

come right off them cards !
All right !

What are you gettin'
so excited about ?
It's a greeting card.

24:54.158 --> 24:57.094
It's not like
you wrote the thing.
No, I didn't write it.

24:57.161 --> 25:00.097

to pick it out ?

25:05.169 --> 25:07.604
