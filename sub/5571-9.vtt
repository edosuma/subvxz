00:03.270 --> 00:05.671
In a stunning and sudden end

00:05.673 --> 00:08.007
to a story that we've been
closely following for weeks,

00:08.009 --> 00:09.675
petty officer Kyle friedgen,

00:09.677 --> 00:11.577
who seemed destined
for death row

00:11.579 --> 00:13.545
for killing his ex-girlfriend,
joy vanatter,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.898
is now a free man.

00:15.899 --> 00:18.250
With the judge throwing out
a vital piece of DNA evidence

00:18.252 --> 00:20.219
linking friedgen to the murder,

00:20.221 --> 00:23.088
he now walks out of jail
through a loophole in the law.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.190
Here they come!
They're coming out!

00:25.192 --> 00:27.593
(Reporters clamoring)

00:27.595 --> 00:29.128
Detective Malone.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.396
What do you think
about the judge's ruling?

00:30.398 --> 00:32.081
We arrested the right guy.

00:32.082 --> 00:33.765
Mr. wyner, would you care
to comment on the fact that

00:33.768 --> 00:36.602
your mishandling of a warrant
caused evidence to be thrown out

00:36.604 --> 00:38.470
and the charges dismissed?

00:38.472 --> 00:40.072
It was an unfortunate
misunderstanding,

00:40.074 --> 00:41.740
but I accept
full responsibility.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.143
Will this affect your run
for city state's attorney?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.577
I'm more concerned about
the miscarriage of justice.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.514
Uh, the hearing
was a travesty.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.582
A guilty man
is getting away with murder.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.583
Thank you.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.652
(Reporters clamoring)

01:02.730 --> 01:04.396
Come on, honey.
Let's get you out of here.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.465
I can't wait
to get home.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.839
My car's in
the parking structure.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.810
Hanna, come on.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.815
I'm not going home
with you, Kyle.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.352
I'm moving in
with my parents.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.525
I stood by you.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.693
You're free now,

01:34.695 --> 01:38.464
and... I'm done.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.738
Carrie:
I'm sorry, Kyle.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.538
I'm just exhausted.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.772
I didn't sleep at all
last night.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.307
How come?

02:22.309 --> 02:25.611
Zoe insists on having
the lights on.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.279
Any reason
for that?

02:27.281 --> 02:29.214
Well... nyctophobia,

02:29.216 --> 02:31.650
which is this...
Fear of darkness.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.885
I mean, you know,
here she is,

02:32.887 --> 02:35.220
she's this kick-ass
atf agent...

02:35.222 --> 02:36.522
She's got to sleep
with the lights on?

02:36.524 --> 02:39.224
Well, a lot of people
have phobias, Tony.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.792
Even you.
Don't get on
your high horse,

02:40.794 --> 02:42.628
Mr. fear of heights.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.296
Acrophobia, so what?
A lot of people live with that.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.231
Bish? Any phobias?

02:46.233 --> 02:47.399
Yeah, phobophobia.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.471
Fear of people with phobias.

02:52.472 --> 02:53.705
You know, I once dated a girl
who had pteronophobia.
What is that?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.440
The fear of being tickled
with a feather.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.242
That's interesting. Kinky.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.244
Wait a minute. You haven't dated
that many people.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.379
Do I know this person?

03:00.381 --> 03:01.847
Is it Delilah?

03:01.849 --> 03:03.382
No, it's not Delilah.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.519
It's Abby.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.888
Is it Abby?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.657
It is.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.824
It's Abby.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.826
Listen to me.
She will kill me, okay?

03:14.828 --> 03:18.664
You have to promise, promise
that you will not tell her.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.265
I promise.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.301
You have my word
as a gentleman,

03:22.303 --> 03:23.902
I promise.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.771
Bishop:
All right.

03:25.773 --> 03:26.838
Thanks for trying.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.708
(Sighs)

03:31.879 --> 03:34.479
Jake and I are going to
the Kennedy center tonight.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.882
Can't get reservations for
anywhere decent afterwards.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.417
Any ideas?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.851
Adams house grill.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.787
Senior's favorite.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.754
I'll make a call.

03:42.756 --> 03:43.789
Thanks.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.923
That'd be great, Tony.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.559
Anyone hear from the boss?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.731
That's good, thank you.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.934
Thought you weren't hungry.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.636
(Chuckles)
You know,
i can order you

03:57.638 --> 03:59.771
your own side of bacon.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.839
No, i-I'm good.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.374
It just... it just smelled good.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.310
I'm glad you suggested
that we meet here.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.612
How's the knee?
Oh, it's good.

04:06.614 --> 04:07.946
It's good.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.514
It, uh, it swells,
i ice it, you know.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.816
(Laughs)

04:18.626 --> 04:21.627
He have something to do
with the, uh... "Favor"

04:21.629 --> 04:23.528
you wouldn't talk to me
about on the phone?

04:23.530 --> 04:24.830
Carrie:
Know who he is?

04:24.832 --> 04:27.082
Gibbs:
Well, yeah.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.333
The murder and arrest did get
a lot of media coverage.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.470
Kyle, this is special
agent Gibbs.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.008
Miss Clark said you might
be able to help me, sir.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.044
Help you with what?

04:39.046 --> 04:40.545
Kyle, sit down.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.717
Since the Baltimore judge

04:45.719 --> 04:47.886
dismissed the charges
against petty officer friedgen,

04:47.888 --> 04:49.988
his life has been hell.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.957
His wife has left him.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.393
She is threatening
to deny him access

04:54.395 --> 04:55.961
to their
soon-to-be-born child.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.696
He's reported back to duty
aboard the<i> ulysses,</i>

04:57.698 --> 05:00.365
and his shipmates
are harassing him.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.501
Friedgen:
You gotta understand.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.036
I didn't do anything.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.971
I'm innocent.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.639
But nobody believes me.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.707
Everyone thinks
I'm guilty of murder

05:08.709 --> 05:11.043
and got off on a technicality.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.978
The police aren't looking
for anyone else, Gibbs.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.714
What do you want me to do?

05:15.716 --> 05:18.016
I want NCIS
to arrest me for murder.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.552
I want the truth to come out.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.588
I deserve my day in court, sir.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.325
I want to be court-martialed.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.971
He wants us to arrest him?
Gibbs:
Yes.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.740
McGee:
Well, you gotta
give the guy credit.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.808
It's a novel request.

05:42.810 --> 05:43.809
Give his lawyer credit.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.344
She thinks outside the box.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.879
It opens the door for us
to investigate the murder.

05:47.881 --> 05:48.947
It's crazy.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.048
Why would
he want us involved?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.650
Gibbs:
Because he swears
he's innocent.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.752
Prisons are filled with guys
who swear they're innocent.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.487
Yeah. The difference is,
friedgen's not in prison.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.788
So, what do we know
about him?

05:56.790 --> 05:57.989
What do we know
about the victim?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.391
Well, Kyle friedgen

05:59.393 --> 06:01.460
and joy vanatter
dated in high school.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.395
He got her pregnant
when she was 16.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.663
She had an abortion.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.997
A year later,
they got into a violent argument

06:05.999 --> 06:07.733
and he was arrested for abuse.

06:07.735 --> 06:08.734
Tony:
Got a year's probation.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.735
When he turned 18,

06:09.737 --> 06:10.769
he enlisted in the Navy.

06:10.771 --> 06:11.837
Since then,
it appears

06:11.839 --> 06:13.372
that he's gotten
his life in order.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.873
He's got a clean
military record.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.942
He married his wife,
Hanna, two years ago,

06:16.944 --> 06:19.378
and they're expecting their
first child next month.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.012
Things went less well
for joy vanatter.

06:21.014 --> 06:24.082
She's been arrested on drug
and prostitution charges.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.884
DiNozzo, take McGee with you,
go to Baltimore.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.419
Find out what
the police know.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.953
I'll find out who's in charge
of the investigation.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.690
Look at this with fresh eyes.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.742
Can Hanna really keep me
from seeing my own child?

06:33.743 --> 06:35.793
Well, as we've seen, you never
know what a judge might do.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.865
Her father got to her.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.833
He never liked me.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.669
Jag is on board, Carrie.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.739
They're willing to go through
with the court-martial,

06:47.741 --> 06:49.408
pending our investigation.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.576
Other than the DNA evidence
that was tossed,

06:51.578 --> 06:53.712
everything else against
Kyle is circumstantial.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.114
He and the victim
had history together,

06:56.116 --> 06:57.916
and exchanged some texts
and a phone call

06:57.918 --> 06:59.050
the day of the murder,
but that's it.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.186
I haven't seen
the Baltimore file yet.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.989
What, exactly,
did the judge throw out?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.025
A syringe,

07:07.027 --> 07:09.428
with traces
of joy vanatter's blood.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.530
It was found in Kyle's car.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.067
You want to explain that?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.502
I can't.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.503
But I swear,

07:18.505 --> 07:19.905
I haven't seen
her in years.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.039
She texted me.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.441
She said she wanted
to meet that day,

07:22.443 --> 07:23.442
but I didn't.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.676
Someone must
have planted

07:24.678 --> 07:26.077
the damn needle.
Who?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.048
You want the truth?

07:30.050 --> 07:32.050
We're gonna
dig deep on this.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.952
You're a free man
right now.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.788
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.924
I got nothing to lose, sir.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.227
Everyone thinks that I'm guilty.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.029
I might as well be.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.466
I want my life back.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.910
Ah, the smell of feet
in the morning!

07:58.912 --> 08:00.078
Hey, hey!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.514
Malone!
DiNozzo!

08:02.516 --> 08:03.181
(Laughs)

08:03.183 --> 08:05.116
How are you, my brother?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.520
You smell good.
(Laughing)

08:08.522 --> 08:09.788
This is special
agent Tim McGee.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.922
So is this guy behaving himself?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.058
Is this<i> the</i> DiNozzo?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.192
Malone:
In person.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.963
Hey, you are, like,
legend around here.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.965
I have heard a lot of
wild stories about you.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.166
Tell me. "Buck naked bust"?

08:21.168 --> 08:23.068
That's not true.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.037
That is 100% true.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.039
So who was naked,
you or the perp?
Both of us.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.008
I was undercover
at a nudist colony.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.109
Malone:
See, we got this tip.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.844
Pole dancer stole from her boss,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.579
so she's hiding out
in a nudist colony.

08:34.581 --> 08:35.981
DiNozzo volunteers

08:35.983 --> 08:38.083
to go undercover.
Of course he does.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.751
Is it true that
you spotted her right away,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.219
but didn't make the arrest
for two days?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.754
Three days.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.589
DiNozzo'll tell you
all his war stories later.

08:44.591 --> 08:47.058
Um, state's attorney wyner
is waiting to talk to you guys.

08:52.666 --> 08:56.067
Joy vanatter's body was found
on the morning of October 8.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.004
Cause of death...
Blunt force trauma.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.140
Forensics indicates the body
was moved and then dumped.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.775
We never could determine
the location of the murder

09:03.777 --> 09:04.943
or find the weapon.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.478
You rule out robbery?
Yeah.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.012
Among the personal effects
we found were cash.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.815
Over $200.
So what led you
to petty officer friedgen?

09:10.817 --> 09:12.684
Uh, vanatter's
cell phone records.

09:12.686 --> 09:13.952
They showed multiple texts

09:13.954 --> 09:15.186
and a call between
her and friedgen,

09:15.188 --> 09:17.055
but we never did find the phone.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.323
The two were planning to meet
the day of the murder.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.758
Friedgen denies

09:19.760 --> 09:20.892
that they ever hooked up;

09:20.894 --> 09:22.828
says he hasn't
seen her in years.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.763
But he didn't have an alibi
that we could verify.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.097
Yeah, the two had
a violent past,

09:26.099 --> 09:27.966
so he became
a person of interest.

09:27.968 --> 09:28.967
Wyner:
And the clincher?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.802
We found a syringe in his car

09:30.804 --> 09:32.137
with her blood on it.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.139
Proves that they'd
been together previously.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.674
But the judge threw it out.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.776
Yeah, that's my bad.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.144
There was
a misunderstanding

09:39.146 --> 09:40.312
between me
and the judge's clerk.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.814
The warrant wasn't signed
until a few hours

09:42.816 --> 09:45.083
after I'd authorized
detective Malone

09:45.085 --> 09:47.118
to search
friedgen's car.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.353
Without that evidence,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.221
we just didn't have
a strong enough case.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.756
Well, in a court-martial,

09:51.758 --> 09:53.625
a unanimous decision
isn't required by the panel,

09:53.627 --> 09:55.060
so maybe we can get your guy.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.696
Oh, I made you a complete
copy of our records.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.030
Can we have access
to the physical evidence?

09:59.032 --> 10:00.165
I'll make those
arrangements.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.034
Great.
Glad to have NCIS aboard.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.703
You'll have
the complete cooperation

10:04.705 --> 10:05.904
of the state's
attorney's office.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.239
¶ ¶

10:15.248 --> 10:16.615
here we are.
Your table.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.749
Jake:
Oh, this is great.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.884
Thanks. Oh!

10:22.022 --> 10:23.021
Thanks.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.756
Waitress:
And the wine list.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.191
Thank you.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.258
Enjoy.

10:29.363 --> 10:30.695
(Exhales)

10:30.697 --> 10:33.865
Gershwin music.
Symphony orchestra...

10:33.867 --> 10:36.201
Was just what
i needed tonight.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.736
Didn't you love it?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.204
I'm glad we went.
Mmm.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.673
Thanks.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.109
I wish we could
get out more often.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.410
We haven't had
a night like this

10:45.412 --> 10:47.312
since you got back from Dubai.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.115
Geez, you're right.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.416
Thank god you weren't hurt.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.686
Yeah, I was lucky.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.124
Now can you tell me why, uh...

10:59.126 --> 11:01.426
Why you weren't there
when the bomb went off?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.800
The agency's been asking me
the same question.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.703
There was a threat assessment
before the conference,

11:11.705 --> 11:14.406
and it was covered up
and then leaked.

11:14.408 --> 11:17.342
They suspect that I had
knowledge of it.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.710
Did you?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.747
Ellie... come on.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.149
Well, where were you?

11:24.151 --> 11:25.884
(Sighs)
You know, this...

11:25.886 --> 11:29.054
It's so frustrating.

11:31.358 --> 11:35.293
Is this why you've been so
distracted and distant lately?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.462
When you had NSA clearance,

11:37.464 --> 11:40.465
we could discuss things,
at lunch, at home.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.701
But now...
I know.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.103
I understand, and...

11:45.105 --> 11:47.038
I hate it.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.141
I miss our sneaking off
to lunch at Chez Nicole.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.710
(Chuckles)

11:51.712 --> 11:53.278
(Laughs)

11:53.280 --> 11:54.846
You know, I still go there
almost every day.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.414
By myself.

11:58.151 --> 12:02.120
We have got to spend
more time together.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.356
Abby:
Let's see what we got.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.493
All right, this is the box
of evidence collected by

12:08.495 --> 12:11.229
Baltimore pd at the crime scene
where they found the body.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.331
Looks like a blouse.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.867
All right. Now, there should be
three more bags of clothing.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.770
Shoes, pants...

12:18.772 --> 12:20.472
Undergarments.

12:20.474 --> 12:23.141
Good morning, Abby, Timothy.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.342
I understand from Mr. Palmer

12:24.344 --> 12:26.277
you have the Baltimore
coroner's report.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.445
I do.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.446
Ah.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.014
Thank you.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.783
This is the cash that was
in the victim's pocket.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.822
It's ten
20-dollar bills.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.456
Ah. The infamous syringe found
in petty officer friedgen's car.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.893
Which is inadmissible
in a court-martial

12:41.895 --> 12:43.194
for the same reason it was

12:43.196 --> 12:45.063
inadmissible in
the criminal trial.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.965
But I'm gonna give
it a once-over.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.967
Or a twice-over.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.302
Well, Gibbs says we have to
start at square one.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.338
Are you gonna have
joy vanatter's body exhumed?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.906
I don't have to;
It's still being held

12:54.908 --> 12:56.775
in the Baltimore morgue.

12:56.777 --> 12:57.976
McGee:
Well, that's odd.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.110
She's been dead
for over a month.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.979
Well, no family member
has come forward

13:00.981 --> 13:02.380
to claim the body.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.517
In such cases, the m.E.
Holds on to the remains,

13:05.519 --> 13:08.253
well, as long as
he thinks necessary.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.455
I'm going to dispatch
Mr. Palmer

13:10.457 --> 13:13.324
to retrieve Ms. vanatter.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.859
(Door closes)

13:14.861 --> 13:17.462
We will be moving
into my bedroom.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.898
My father converted it
into his home office,

13:19.900 --> 13:22.133
and now I'm gonna be
sharing it with the baby.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.135
You're having a boy.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.336
(Chuckles)
Yeah.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.404
When are you due?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.106
Three weeks.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.375
Never thought I'd be
doing this alone.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.977
Don't get me wrong,
my parents are great.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.179
It's just, uh...

13:34.181 --> 13:35.914
Not how I thought
it would be.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.949
How about I give you a hand?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.317
He's really good
with tools.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.318
Oh, please.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.319
Be my guest.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.287
Bishop:
This must be

13:42.289 --> 13:44.155
a difficult time
for you, Hanna.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.861
Kyle put me and my parents
through hell the past month.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.596
His arrest, the hearing,

13:51.598 --> 13:54.332
finding out he was seeing
his old girlfriend.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.036
Was he ever, um,
violent with you?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.938
No.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.439
You know about
his past troubles?

14:01.441 --> 14:02.540
Kyle never said anything.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.577
He kept all that from me,
and now I realize

14:05.579 --> 14:07.312
he never was truthful.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.080
That's why I believed he...

14:10.116 --> 14:12.417
Capable of
hurting someone?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.452
You mean killing?

14:16.056 --> 14:18.289
Yeah.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.892
I'm sure the police
already asked you this,

14:20.894 --> 14:24.229
but was Kyle acting differently
around the time of the murder?

14:24.231 --> 14:27.398
(Dog barking outside)

14:27.400 --> 14:29.100
I don't need
this right now.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.435
He knows I don't
want to see him.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.370
Uh, why don't you
take a seat?
No!

14:32.372 --> 14:35.006
I just want this whole thing
in the past.

14:37.611 --> 14:39.510
Kyle, get back in the car.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.213
No, sir.
I want to talk to my wife.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.449
Gibbs: You asked for my help, so
I'm gonna give you some advice.

14:44.451 --> 14:48.620
A confrontation right now
with your wife or her parents...

14:50.090 --> 14:51.556
...it's not gonna
help your cause.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.241
(Elevator bell dings)

15:12.012 --> 15:13.578
How'd it go
with the wife?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.447
Bishop:
She's pretty upset.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.315
Good thing she had an alibi
for the time of the murder.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.167
What'd you find?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.018
The police never seriously
looked at anyone else

15:21.021 --> 15:23.321
after they pulled joy vanatter's
cell phone records.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.123
Why?
McGee:
Day before her murder,

15:25.125 --> 15:26.541
vanatter and petty officer
friedgen were exchanging texts.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.958
Tony:
She was pretty adamant.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.093
She wanted to see him.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.395
This is their final exchange,

15:30.397 --> 15:31.629
the morning she died.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.931
Two minutes later,

15:32.933 --> 15:34.516
he called her.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.100
They spoke for four
minutes and 16 seconds.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.635
Unfortunately, we don't know
the contents of that call.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.320
And when the police

15:39.321 --> 15:41.004
questioned friedgen,
he acknowledged the call,

15:41.007 --> 15:44.375
but he swore he told her
he would never meet her.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.476
McGee: When they
found the syringe

15:45.478 --> 15:47.078
with her DNA on it
in his car,

15:47.080 --> 15:48.697
they knew he was lying.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.315
Vanatter also made phone
calls to a burn phone.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.283
Baltimore pd couldn't
trace it, neither could I.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.052
I'm thinking maybe
to her pusher.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.520
I had some connections,

15:55.522 --> 15:57.255
uh, on the mean streets
of mobtown.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.957
Thinking maybe I could go
nose around.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.291
McGee, keep him out of trouble.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.427
Going to Norfolk.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.495
Check with friedgen's C.O.
and shipmates.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.131
Bishop?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.033
Where you going?

16:09.035 --> 16:11.569
Uh, wanted to surprise Jake,
meet him for lunch.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.607
(Elevator bell dings)

16:19.980 --> 16:22.046
¶ ¶

16:46.373 --> 16:48.506
¶ ¶

17:02.155 --> 17:04.155
Tony:
<i> This was part of my beat</i>

17:04.157 --> 17:06.190
<i> when I was in uniform,</i>
<i> on foot patrol.</i>

17:06.192 --> 17:08.126
Things change much?
Yeah.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.527
See that thai massage parlor?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.462
Used to be
a Korean massage parlor.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.764
(Rap music playing nearby)

17:12.766 --> 17:14.298
Ooh.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.299
Tony: Hold on.
Man: Right.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.068
Good lookin' out, cheech.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.777
Hey, good lookin'.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.345
What you got cookin'?

17:27.347 --> 17:29.714
Tony freakin' DiNozzo?!

17:29.716 --> 17:31.182
Man!

17:31.184 --> 17:33.084
You know I thought you was dead?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.186
(Chuckles)

17:38.391 --> 17:40.124
(Tires screeching)

17:42.095 --> 17:43.361
(Panting)

17:43.363 --> 17:46.497
(Chuckles): You're too old
for this, cheech!

17:46.499 --> 17:49.233
Cheech, you're gonna have
a heart attack. Stop it!

17:49.235 --> 17:50.701
(Cheech grunting)

17:50.703 --> 17:53.271
Ah, damn!
Cheech...

17:53.273 --> 17:55.073
Cheech:
Help me up. (Grunts)

17:55.075 --> 17:57.108
(Laughs):
Oh!

17:57.110 --> 17:59.077
(Panting): Oh, man.
Oh, look at that.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.312
Your favorite plant.
That's very subtle.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.713
You know, he always been
a hater. You know that, right?

18:02.715 --> 18:04.082
Look.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.216
It pays to advertise.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.085
I want them to know
what I'm selling.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.820
Isn't marijuana legal
in Maryland?

18:08.822 --> 18:10.455
Yeah, but who wants
to pay retail?

18:10.457 --> 18:11.389
(Chuckles)

18:11.391 --> 18:12.256
My dude!

18:12.258 --> 18:13.691
Where you been, boy?

18:13.692 --> 18:15.125
You know, cheech,
back in the day,

18:15.128 --> 18:17.495
was my number one
and most enthusiastic snitch.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.763
I'm not a snitch.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.797
What you talking about?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.200
I'm a p.I.C.-- A paid

18:22.202 --> 18:23.134
information consultant.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.302
I'm a businessman.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.170
There's a difference, man.
Come on.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.238
Well, we're not
gonna pay you,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.140
but you know her?
Of course.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.441
Man, that's the girl
the sailor killed.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.442
Everybody know that.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.643
You know her?

18:32.645 --> 18:35.113
Oh, do I<i> know?</i>

18:35.115 --> 18:37.181
Well, I know guys that know her.
(Chuckles)

18:37.183 --> 18:38.182
What you need?

18:38.184 --> 18:39.417
We need a name, cheech.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.319
Did you not see me
try to run just now?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.620
My knees are barely
hanging on now.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.288
I-i don't need them broke.
Okay. All right, look.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.556
I'm not here to mess around.
Let's do this.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.691
What are you doing?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.526
I'm putting you under arrest.
For what?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.194
A couple of
joints? Really?

18:50.196 --> 18:51.562
I'm sure we can
find more than that on you.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.563
Yeah, I'm sure you can.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.265
Wait, wait. Okay, okay, okay.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.200
I'll tell you
what you want to know.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.902
Look, rumor has it,

18:57.904 --> 19:00.138
she came into some money, right?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.272
And, uh, she was trying

19:01.274 --> 19:02.707
to buy a higher grade of heroin.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.342
You know,
not the cheap stuff anymore.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.443
But...

19:05.445 --> 19:08.579
She wasn't hooking
to pay for it.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.148
Where'd she get the money?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.349
She started seeing
some suit from uptown.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.368
And the suit--

19:13.369 --> 19:15.386
oh, he was all up into
her little specialty,

19:15.388 --> 19:17.522
you know, s and m.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.856
(Chuckles)

19:18.858 --> 19:19.891
Exactly!

19:19.893 --> 19:21.192
You a client, too?

19:21.194 --> 19:22.793
Thank you, cheech.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.562
Let's get out of here.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.298
You ain't gonna pay me?
Are you serious?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.666
(Elevator bell dings)

19:30.603 --> 19:32.236
Hey, Abbs.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.372
Bishop.
I got something.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.341
The bills from
joy vanatter's body--

19:37.343 --> 19:38.543
they're all relatively new.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.778
The serial numbers
are sequential.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.847
So I put a call in
to the federal reserve

19:42.849 --> 19:44.515
to see what bank
they were distributed to.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.584
That's great, uh, but I need
help with something else.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.352
I'm all yours.
Three weeks ago,

19:48.354 --> 19:50.788
when I didn't know if Jake
was dead or alive in Dubai,

19:50.790 --> 19:52.523
Delilah and I were in MTAC,

19:52.525 --> 19:55.560
and she accessed
a Dubai taxi passenger-cam.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.728
Any way you can
pull that up?
Oh, yeah.

19:57.730 --> 20:01.299
If it was in MTAC, it'll be
on the archival hard drive.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.700
Why do you want
to see it again?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.669
I was so excited
to see Jake alive

20:04.671 --> 20:07.338
that I didn't pay attention
to who the other passenger was

20:07.340 --> 20:08.739
in the backseat of the taxi.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.708
(Computer trills, beeps)
That it?

20:14.247 --> 20:15.980
What?

20:15.982 --> 20:19.350
I just saw Jake with a woman
in a restaurant.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.819
I'm pretty sure it's her.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.288
They were in
a-a really heavy discussion.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.257
My god.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.293
You don't think something's
going on between them, do you?

20:29.295 --> 20:32.430
It crossed my mind,
but I'm not going there.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.431
I know her.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.233
Her name's
Taylor Matthews.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.535
She's NSA's version
of internal affairs.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.371
I think Jake's in trouble.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.872
Why?

20:43.810 --> 20:46.544
He told me there'd been a leak,
that he was under suspicion.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.646
She was
reprimanding him.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.886
Man:<i> The ship's in port for</i>
<i>two months getting retrofitted.</i>

20:55.888 --> 20:57.888
There's only
a skeleton crew aboard.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.625
Petty officer friedgen said
he didn't get a warm reception

21:00.627 --> 21:02.927
from his shipmates when
he returned to duty.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.328
I'd say that's accurate.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.297
He never had
a lot of friends aboard.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.399
Not exactly Mr. warmth.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.334
Told me his personal
gear was damaged.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.803
That why you're here?
Down this way.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.607
I know you've gone over this
with the police,

21:16.609 --> 21:19.543
but I'd like to hear about the
night joy vanatter was killed.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.446
Petty officer friedgen
was due to report at 2100,

21:22.448 --> 21:23.748
but didn't log in until

21:23.750 --> 21:26.317
0100 the next day--
four hours late.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.985
Well, he claims
that he was late

21:27.987 --> 21:29.887
because there was an
accident on the expressway.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.222
There was an accident,

21:31.223 --> 21:32.556
but was friedgen really
stuck on the road?

21:32.558 --> 21:34.058
I don't know.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.560
Commander, you don't
sound like you believe him.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.496
I'll give you a heads-up,
special agent Gibbs.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.965
You're about to interview
several of his shipmates.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.402
To a man and woman, they
think he's guilty of murder.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.079
Bishop:
I'm listening, yes.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.817
Bish is in the cone of silence.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.352
You know who
she's talking to?

22:01.354 --> 22:03.354
Jake, I think.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.523
It's obviously something
she doesn't want us to hear.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.857
Mmm.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.859
She seems a little down.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.429
I think maybe
i should talk to her.
Just leave her be.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.464
Maybe she's in need
of a little brotherly advice.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.536
Thanks for the chips.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.840
Tony:
You are very welcome.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.542
Everything okay?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.544
Looks like you got
something on your mind.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.880
There's some sort of
crisis at the NSA.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.016
Jake's at home packing a bag--
i don't know where he's going.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.651
"Need to know," huh?
Yeah.

22:33.653 --> 22:34.985
Well, can't be far.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.387
Said he'll be back
tomorrow afternoon.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.089
Well, you wanted
to marry a spy.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.424
He's a lawyer, Tony.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.059
You find out anything
in Baltimore?

22:42.061 --> 22:43.861
We got some leads
we're working on.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.062
Tony's definitely
in his element, boss--

22:45.064 --> 22:47.098
snitches, pushers,
pimps, prostitutes.

22:47.100 --> 22:49.533
Well... learn anything
in Norfolk?

22:49.535 --> 22:52.436
Petty officer friedgen
was telling the truth.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.939
His shipmates all think
he's guilty.

22:54.941 --> 22:55.973
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.508
I have something.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.743
I just... I don't
know if it's good

22:58.745 --> 22:59.777
or if it's bad.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.681
Okay, so I tracked
these serial numbers

23:03.683 --> 23:05.816
from the $20 bills that were
found on the girl's body.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.818
They're all
relatively new.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.487
They were printed
at the Philadelphia mint

23:09.489 --> 23:11.155
only 62 days ago.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.824
From there, they
ended up at a branch

23:13.826 --> 23:16.026
of the national armed forces
credit union located...

23:16.028 --> 23:17.428
Ready?

23:18.131 --> 23:20.531
...at the Norfolk Navy shipyard.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.533
Interesting.
Yes, and I'm not done.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.669
There's more. So banks like
to use the new crisp bills

23:25.671 --> 23:28.539
in their atms so they
don't jam up anything.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.674
Fortunately for us, those
machines are equipped

23:30.676 --> 23:34.011
with optical scanners that
record the serial numbers

23:34.013 --> 23:35.613
as they're being dispensed.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.681
Are you gonna tell us you know
who withdrew the money?

23:37.683 --> 23:39.016
Yes.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.603
October 7.

23:42.604 --> 23:44.687
One petty officer
third class...

23:44.690 --> 23:47.525
Kyle friedgen.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.059
He gave vanatter
the money.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.961
Said he hadn't
seen her in years.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.776
(Door opens)

24:06.479 --> 24:07.611
You ask for my help.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.679
(Carrie gasps)

24:08.681 --> 24:09.814
Then you lie to me?

24:09.816 --> 24:11.148
Gibbs, what are you
talking about?

24:11.150 --> 24:13.150
You told me you never
saw Joyce vanatter.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.820
Baltimore pd found money
on her body

24:15.822 --> 24:18.522
that we traced to a withdrawal
you made from an atm.

24:18.524 --> 24:21.025
Is that true?
Is that true?

24:21.027 --> 24:23.694
Joy wouldn't stop texting me.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.062
Said she wanted to meet.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.897
I made the mistake
of calling her.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.232
She said
she needed money.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.700
I said I wouldn't do it.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.202
But then I caved
when she threatened

24:31.204 --> 24:32.870
to call my wife
and tell her about our past.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.738
So I drove to Baltimore,
i gave her the money.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.540
That's it.
Why'd you lie to the police?

24:36.542 --> 24:37.875
Because when they first
questioned me,

24:37.877 --> 24:39.393
I didn't know joy was dead,

24:39.394 --> 24:40.910
and I didn't want Hanna
to know that I'd met with her.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.247
No, when you found out
she was murdered,

24:43.249 --> 24:45.182
why didn't you
tell them the truth?

24:45.184 --> 24:47.184
Because I panicked.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.920
I felt like I had to stick
to my story-- I'd look guilty.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.956
You buying any of this?
Why'd she want
the money? Drugs?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.958
No. No, she said she got
into some trouble,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.493
and she needed
to get out of town.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.261
What kind of trouble?
She wouldn't tell me.

24:57.263 --> 25:00.531
I do not like being lied to.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.733
You will be put in a
holding cell tonight.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.235
You got what you wanted.

25:04.237 --> 25:07.171
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be charged with murder.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.947
Malone:
Nice work, Gibbs.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.283
The money proves friedgen
met with vanatter.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.618
I got enough to
refile charges.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.952
Yeah, we'll take him
into custody.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.955
No, it's an
NCIS case now.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.624
Man:
All right, let's go.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.958
Carrie: I will see you
in the morning,

25:27.960 --> 25:29.693
and we'll decide then
what our next step is.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.167
(Door opens)

25:37.169 --> 25:39.236
(Door squeaks shut)

25:42.742 --> 25:45.743
Hey, bishop.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.612
It's after midnight.

25:48.614 --> 25:49.613
You okay?

25:49.615 --> 25:50.948
No.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.616
(Chuckles)

25:52.618 --> 25:55.286
Been, uh...
Driving around.

25:55.288 --> 25:58.589
Didn't really want to go home
to an empty apartment.

25:58.591 --> 25:59.723
Really is a
boat in here.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.059
I thought Tony was
just punking me.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.093
Where's Jake?

26:03.095 --> 26:04.628
Not really sure.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.796
Said he was working.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.131
You don't believe him?

26:08.568 --> 26:09.967
I don't know what to believe.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.278
Here, sit down.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.684
You talk, I'll listen.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.591
Uh...

26:35.027 --> 26:38.028
It's Jake's work.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.030
He won't tell me anything.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.699
He can't.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.668
(Scoffs)

26:44.670 --> 26:46.236
I hate the NSA.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.976
He hides everything
behind a veil of secrecy.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.464
What's he hiding?

26:56.465 --> 26:57.715
I think he's being investigated
by internal affairs.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.184
Why?

27:00.186 --> 27:01.619
There's been a leak
at the agency.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.389
That's never good.
No.

27:06.892 --> 27:09.960
Any wise words?

27:11.831 --> 27:14.164
Bishop, do you understand
the irony in all this,

27:14.166 --> 27:16.767
you asking me
for marital advice?

27:16.769 --> 27:18.702
(Chuckles)

27:22.742 --> 27:24.808
Well, he can't tell
you the details.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.980
He can tell you how he feels.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.886
You make him talk to you.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.193
¶ ¶

27:46.132 --> 27:47.798
hey, guys.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.133
Morning.
Hey, Abbs.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.668
What's up?

27:50.670 --> 27:52.236
Nothing.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.803
Just came down to see
how you're doing.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.139
I'm fine.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.140
Mmm.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.008
What you working on?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.344
Abby: Well, I confirmed
Baltimore forensic's finding.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.447
The DNA on the needle does
belong to joy vanatter.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.315
And then I ran the residue
from inside the barrel

28:05.317 --> 28:06.417
through major mass spec,

28:06.419 --> 28:09.286
and it's black tar heroin.

28:09.288 --> 28:13.290
It's a very cheap low-grade
form of the narcotic.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.292
That's weird,
'cause cheech said

28:15.294 --> 28:18.295
that vanatter was using,
um, high-grade heroin.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.030
He did.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.300
So you gonna follow up?

28:23.302 --> 28:24.668
Oh yeah.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.035
Yeah, no, we...
We will absolutely.

28:31.744 --> 28:32.743
You two are acting weird.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.445
Talk to bishop
today?
No.

28:34.447 --> 28:36.814
She texted us this morning,
said she wasn't coming in.
No explanation.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.849
We were just wondering maybe
she said something to you?

28:38.851 --> 28:40.317
Girl-to-girl?

28:40.319 --> 28:42.219
No.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.387
Abby, we know
you're lying.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.755
Your fingers
are crossed.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.290
I told you she was
gonna play mum.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.424
That's why i
came prepared.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.425
What does that mean?

28:49.895 --> 28:51.428
You told him?!

28:55.434 --> 28:57.101
Okay, okay.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.002
Okay... okay.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.072
Kyle lied to both of us.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.742
Gonna drop him?

29:04.744 --> 29:07.745
Jag'll provide him a lawyer.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.515
No, I'm, uh...

29:11.517 --> 29:13.250
I'm gonna stick with him.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.786
Uh... he was free.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.088
He asked to be
court-martialed.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.423
Why would anyone
do that...
I don't...

29:19.425 --> 29:20.758
If they were guilty?

29:20.760 --> 29:21.759
I don't know why.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.428
Sure feels like
he's playing us.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.096
Oh, so like Baltimore
pd, you got your man,

29:26.098 --> 29:27.431
you're not looking
for anyone else?

29:27.433 --> 29:28.832
Uh, I didn't
say that.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.470
You got your client
under arrest,

29:33.472 --> 29:37.007
and I think it's best
if we stopped talking.

29:37.009 --> 29:40.077
Carrie, I know you,
you're a sharp lawyer.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.380
I don't want to say something

29:43.382 --> 29:46.016
and get misquoted
at the court-martial.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.118
Reporter:<i> So what's</i>
<i> the latest development?</i>

29:48.120 --> 29:50.554
Malone: NCIS has found
new evidence

29:50.556 --> 29:52.556
that prove what we always knew.

29:52.558 --> 29:55.559
Petty officer Kyle friedgen
is guilty of murder.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.227
That's my guy.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.229
Reporter: So do you think
this will boost your campaign

29:59.231 --> 30:01.198
for Baltimore state's
attorney, Mr. wyner?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.533
I don't think it'll hurt,

30:02.535 --> 30:05.202
but, more importantly,
justice will be served.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.887
Thank you.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.571
Reporter: And yet another twist
in this bizarre case.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.375
Got something
for me, duck?

30:11.377 --> 30:13.510
I finished the autopsy
on miss vanatter.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.379
Everything is consistent

30:15.381 --> 30:17.481
with the Baltimore
coroner's findings.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.817
Cause of death was
blunt force trauma,

30:19.819 --> 30:22.986
so all he had to do
was a standard tox screen.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.521
You're gonna do a
more detailed one?
Exactly.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.523
Abby's already started to run

30:26.525 --> 30:28.592
tissue samples
taken from her body.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.093
I'll get
back to you.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.062
You heard from
bishop today?

30:33.399 --> 30:35.399
Gave her the morning off.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.134
Oh.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.881
Ellie.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.985
Uh, why aren't you at work?

30:57.857 --> 30:59.456
Are you feeling okay?

30:59.458 --> 31:02.392
Not really.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.127
We've got to talk.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.565
Okay.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.500
What is it?

31:14.440 --> 31:17.441
For months now, things
have been different.

31:17.443 --> 31:18.575
I know you've
felt it too.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.110
It's my fault.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.279
I'm in a difficult
position and, uh...

31:22.281 --> 31:24.648
Just... let me finish.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.986
At first, I thought that
you were having an affair.

31:28.988 --> 31:33.056
But... I know
what's going on now,

31:33.058 --> 31:34.558
and I know that you're
in trouble at work.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.010
Ellie.

31:36.011 --> 31:37.461
Yesterday I went to
surprise you at lunch,

31:37.463 --> 31:39.997
but when I got there, i
saw you being reprimanded

31:39.999 --> 31:41.531
by Taylor Matthews
from internal affairs.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.599
Stop.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.106
I'm not in trouble at work.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.944
This is so hard.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.047
I've been trying
to tell you,

31:57.049 --> 31:59.383
but I... I just...
I don't know how.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.952
I'm having an affair
with Taylor.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.255
At first it was just
an office flirtation,

32:05.257 --> 32:08.592
that's all it was,
but... then we went to Dubai.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.627
I'm not making excuses,
but after the bombing...

32:10.629 --> 32:11.929
Shut up.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.097
I don't want
to hear anymore.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.966
Ellie. Ellie, you
don't deserve this.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.635
Look, I hate myself
for what I've done.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.338
Were you with
her last night?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.619
What's gonna happen
with her remains?

32:35.621 --> 32:37.287
Well, eventually,

32:37.289 --> 32:39.957
I will have to return miss
vanatter to Baltimore.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.026
By then, if no one
has claimed her,

32:43.028 --> 32:45.128
the body will be cremated.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.397
And her ashes?

32:47.399 --> 32:49.032
Well, once a year,
the state of Maryland

32:49.034 --> 32:52.736
has a ceremonial spreading
of all unclaimed ashes.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.739
There's got to be
somebody out there

32:55.741 --> 32:57.641
that cared for her.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.977
Like a-a friend

32:59.979 --> 33:01.578
or a distant relative or...

33:01.580 --> 33:02.980
I want to find them.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.616
What we got?

33:06.618 --> 33:09.219
Miss Sciuto has the interesting
results of the tox screen.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.454
Abby:
The narcotics found
in her tissue samples

33:10.456 --> 33:13.457
were high-grade white heroin.

33:13.459 --> 33:16.093
It's far more
expensive and refined

33:16.095 --> 33:18.528
than the black tar heroin
that was in the syringe

33:18.530 --> 33:21.298
found in petty officer
friedgen's car.

33:21.300 --> 33:25.002
Yet the needle had
miss vanatter's DNA on it.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.371
So it couldn't
have been

33:27.373 --> 33:29.773
a syringe
that she used recently.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.476
Could friedgen
be telling the truth?

33:32.478 --> 33:34.544
It was planted in his car.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.491
Okay, let's give
petty officer friedgen

33:47.493 --> 33:49.460
the benefit of the doubt.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.428
Say the syringe was planted
in his car by the murderer.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.063
Who?

33:53.065 --> 33:55.198
Joy vanatter had a history
of drug abuse.
Her supplier?

33:55.200 --> 33:57.034
Your snitch tell you
who she was buying from?

33:57.036 --> 33:58.569
No.
Could it be him?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.103
Well, he was selling pot
when we caught up with him.

34:00.105 --> 34:02.039
Cheech? Come on.
I don't think so.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.807
Joy vanatter's last bust was
two years ago in Baltimore.

34:03.809 --> 34:04.775
Look into that case.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.143
My turn to drive?

34:06.145 --> 34:08.045
(Elevator bell dings)
Oh. All right.

34:10.682 --> 34:11.748
Hey, bishop.

34:22.327 --> 34:23.326
You okay?

34:23.328 --> 34:25.395
Uh...

34:27.066 --> 34:28.131
No.

34:31.336 --> 34:33.236
Jake's having
an affair.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.607
You sure?

34:39.244 --> 34:41.411
How'd you find out?

34:43.315 --> 34:45.282
He told me.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.385
I'm sorry.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.730
DiNozzo's headed
to Baltimore.

35:00.732 --> 35:01.865
Go with him.

35:04.570 --> 35:08.438
Jake is aware that you
carry a gun for a living?

35:10.242 --> 35:11.608
Here you go.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.377
The evidence from joy vanatter's
bust two years ago.

35:14.379 --> 35:15.445
Thanks.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.548
You're an NCIS agent?

35:18.550 --> 35:19.850
Yeah.

35:19.852 --> 35:21.418
Lot cuter than the guy

35:21.420 --> 35:22.619
you brought yesterday,
agent DiNozzo.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.387
DiNozzo:
That is very true.

35:24.389 --> 35:25.388
So what exactly
are you guys looking for?

35:25.390 --> 35:27.224
Not sure.
Can I take a look?

35:27.226 --> 35:28.425
Help yourself.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.530
Whoa!

35:34.533 --> 35:36.233
I'm impressed.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.334
Bye-bye, greenie.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.202
(Clears throat)

35:39.204 --> 35:42.873
Okay. Joy vanatter was arrested
two years ago, August 13.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.307
Based on a tip
from an informant,

35:44.309 --> 35:46.209
we raided
a shooting gallery.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.378
When the officers broke in,
the needle was still in her arm.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.880
Bishop:
This must be it.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.548
She had a public defender,
got a year,

35:51.550 --> 35:53.817
but only spent six months
in the city detention center.

35:53.819 --> 35:54.851
Who was the informant?

35:54.853 --> 35:56.353
Francis del conte.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.255
Cheech?

35:58.257 --> 35:59.823
Well, that's funny,
he didn't tell me

35:59.825 --> 36:02.292
anything about it
when I talked to him yesterday.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.493
Huh.
Bishop:
Log shows the evidence

36:03.495 --> 36:06.496
was admitted into storage
after the trial.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.899
It sat untouched
for almost two years,

36:08.901 --> 36:10.834
till it was accessed
three weeks ago.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.736
By who?
Alan wyner?

36:12.738 --> 36:15.238
The assistant
state's attorney?
Makes sense.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.873
Wyner was the prosecutor
on both cases,

36:16.875 --> 36:18.742
vanatter's drug bust
two years ago

36:18.744 --> 36:20.443
and friedgen's trial
for her recent murder.

36:20.445 --> 36:23.180
But why go back to evidence
on the old drug bust?

36:23.182 --> 36:25.248
I'm sure he was just
being thorough,

36:25.250 --> 36:27.551
seeing if anything
related back to her murder.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.653
Look, I've been working
closely with the guy, wyner.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.388
He's a good guy.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.623
And he cared
about vanatter.

36:32.624 --> 36:33.857
He asked for
the minimum sentence,

36:33.859 --> 36:35.725
he-he spoke for her
at her parole hearing.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.594
Why the hell
didn't cheech tell me

36:37.596 --> 36:39.429
he got her busted two years ago?

36:41.466 --> 36:43.300
There's no trace of heroin

36:43.302 --> 36:44.568
in the barrel of this syringe

36:44.570 --> 36:46.236
and there's no DNA
on the needle.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.605
This has never been used.

36:48.607 --> 36:52.409
Are you sure this was
evidence in a drug bust

36:52.411 --> 36:53.910
two years ago?

36:53.912 --> 36:56.279
We just got it from the
Baltimore pd evidence locker.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.686
Okay, are we just going
to ignore what's going on here?

37:04.323 --> 37:06.456
Has Jake lost his mind?

37:06.458 --> 37:08.225
I really don't want to talk
about it, Abby.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.896
What else can you tell me
about the needle?

37:18.237 --> 37:20.971
I was able to get
a serial number from it

37:20.973 --> 37:22.839
and I ran
a manufacturing check.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.842
It identifies the syringe
as coming from a batch

37:25.844 --> 37:28.878
that was manufactured
only three months ago.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.617
(Elevator bell dings)

37:34.553 --> 37:35.986
McGee.

37:35.988 --> 37:37.721
You won't believe this.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.765
You have some big balls,
coming here.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.467
I've got to talk to Ellie.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.468
You know where she is?

37:51.470 --> 37:52.802
She's not answering

37:52.804 --> 37:55.038
my calls or my texts.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.973
Do you blame her?

37:56.975 --> 37:58.308
It's not smart,
coming here.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.509
I think you should leave.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.510
Jake:
Look, uh,

38:00.512 --> 38:01.578
I get that you're upset,

38:01.580 --> 38:03.480
but she is my wife.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.515
Then treat her
like one.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.052
You should leave.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.754
I'll walk you out.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.997
Tony:
Think he's gonna
punch him out?

38:20.999 --> 38:22.699
Love to see it.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.471
Come on, Gibbs,

38:28.473 --> 38:31.441
you know me.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.909
You need to understand...

38:32.911 --> 38:34.311
Understand what?

38:35.414 --> 38:36.780
You cheating on bishop?

38:39.685 --> 38:41.451
I never wanted
this to happen.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.386
(Elevator bell dings)

38:47.592 --> 38:49.559
Get your head
out of your ass, Jake.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.733
Back to work.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.735
Boss, state attorney
Alan wyner--

38:58.737 --> 39:00.570
he's had evidence
thrown out once before.

39:00.572 --> 39:01.671
Early in his career.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.739
It was a misdemeanor
b and e.

39:02.741 --> 39:03.773
Evidence was tossed

39:03.775 --> 39:05.575
because of a mis-timed warrant.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.532
What does that mean?

39:06.533 --> 39:07.488
Well, the clerk told wyner

39:07.489 --> 39:08.444
that he'd have the judge
sign the warrant

39:08.447 --> 39:10.747
when he recessed
court at 3:00.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.782
The trial went long
and wyner jumped the gun.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.551
The seized evidence
was tossed

39:14.553 --> 39:16.619
because the warrant was
signed after the seizure.

39:16.621 --> 39:17.520
Just like in this case.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.688
Wyner's a smart guy, boss.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.490
He wouldn't make
the same mistake twice.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.591
Tony:
Cheech said joy
vanatter was doing

39:21.593 --> 39:23.093
"some suit from uptown."

39:23.095 --> 39:25.929
Alan wyner wears
really nice suits.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.530
Guys, guys, guys!

39:27.532 --> 39:29.065
Abs, you got something?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.533
Oh, yeah.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.602
(Clock chiming the hour)

39:35.474 --> 39:38.908
Hey! What's up?
How's our case moving along?

39:38.910 --> 39:40.510
Well, it's taken
a little change of direction.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.878
We've got a new
person of interest.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.546
Who?

39:43.548 --> 39:45.648
What's this?

39:45.650 --> 39:46.783
A warrant.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.485
Properly signed and executed.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.520
I'm sure it'll hold up in court.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.489
We're gonna search your house,
your office, your car.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.823
I bet we find evidence

39:53.825 --> 39:56.159
linking you
to joy vanatter's murder.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.627
We know you had access
to the evidence room

39:57.629 --> 39:59.062
and you switched the syringes.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.163
Tony:
Hope you were
smart enough

40:00.165 --> 40:01.531
to destroy the burn phone

40:01.533 --> 40:02.665
you used to call her.

40:02.667 --> 40:03.666
Malone:
Why, Alan?

40:03.668 --> 40:05.034
Was she trying to blackmail you?

40:05.036 --> 40:06.569
I mean, hell of a headline.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.505
"Candidate involved
in s&m scandal."

40:08.507 --> 40:10.707
I tried to help her.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.176
Get rehab, paroled...

40:13.178 --> 40:14.144
You were sleeping with her.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.915
I assume you know
your rights, counselor.

40:18.917 --> 40:19.916
Ooh.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.484
You like being dominated, huh?

40:21.486 --> 40:23.086
So let me get
this straight:

40:23.088 --> 40:25.054
You screwed up the warrant
on purpose

40:25.056 --> 40:26.790
so friedgen wouldn't go to jail?

40:26.792 --> 40:28.792
Yeah... and he got off.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.828
So why in the hell
would he ruin it and go to NCIS?

40:31.830 --> 40:34.030
Think you're
a clever guy, wyner?

40:37.536 --> 40:39.869
That's a pretty
twisted morality.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.608
Carrie:
<i> Paperwork's done.</i>
<i> We're out of here.</i>

40:45.610 --> 40:47.444
Thank you, sir.

40:49.181 --> 40:50.847
If you had been totally honest
with the police

40:50.849 --> 40:52.215
the first time
you talked to them,

40:52.217 --> 40:53.650
it wouldn't have gone this far.

40:53.652 --> 40:54.717
I've got most of
my life back.

40:54.719 --> 40:57.687
I report to my ship
at 0600 tomorrow.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.456
Glad I still have the Navy,

40:59.458 --> 41:01.891
but things will never
be the same with my wife.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.994
She thought
i was guilty of murder.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.763
Just give her some time, Kyle.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.565
You're about to have a son.

41:08.567 --> 41:09.933
Be a part of his life.

41:09.935 --> 41:12.569
Breakfast again soon?

41:12.571 --> 41:14.637
You know where to find me.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.242
Bye.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.725
I've made a decision.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.062
Could we talk?

41:40.832 --> 41:43.666

41:43.668 --> 41:48.171

I'm giving up on you ¶

42:25.210 --> 42:27.277
<i> I'm in a bad place.</i>

42:27.279 --> 42:30.680

42:30.682 --> 42:32.849

42:49.968 --> 42:52.135

42:54.139 --> 42:56.339
