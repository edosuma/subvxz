00:07.257 --> 00:09.384
[newsman] Listen up, please. Hold it down.

00:09.884 --> 00:12.178
Hold it down a minute. Hold it one minute.

00:12.262 --> 00:16.307
If you have a tape or a package
that's ready to feed,

00:16.391 --> 00:20.854
bring it to the feed point
between 11:00 and 11:30

00:20.937 --> 00:22.772
and 12:00 and 12:30.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.651
Keep your pieces short
so that we can all get on the air.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.321
-[typewriters clacking]
-[indistinct chatter]

00:30.405 --> 00:31.990
Here it comes. Three, two, one...

00:32.073 --> 00:36.661
This is Larry Welling reporting live
from Ted Bundy's double murder trial.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.122
He is charged with killing
two female students

00:39.581 --> 00:41.124
at Florida State University.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.420
He is also being sought for questioning
in 36 slayings.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.381
[female reporter] Those whose bodies
have been found were sexually molested

00:48.465 --> 00:49.841
and severely beaten.

00:50.383 --> 00:55.472
The lurid nature of the case,
the depravity of the violence,

00:55.930 --> 00:58.641
and the personality of Ted Bundy

00:59.476 --> 01:03.146
combined to make this something
that the media could not ignore.

01:03.521 --> 01:06.274
[male reporter] As a result
of a Florida State Supreme Court ruling,

01:06.357 --> 01:08.902
the Bundy trial would be open
to TV cameras,

01:09.444 --> 01:12.614
no matter what the prosecution
or the defense had to say.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.910
This was the first time a trial
had ever been covered by TV like this.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.161
[man] I'm ready to go!

01:18.244 --> 01:22.373
[Hula] It was tremendously exciting.
Lights on, cameras rolling.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.584
Smile Ted.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.587
[Hula] Technologically,
it was another era.

01:28.630 --> 01:32.634
Electronic news gathering
was just in its infancy.

01:32.717 --> 01:36.429
[woman] If anybody's using a walkie-talkie
on this floor, shut it down!

01:36.513 --> 01:38.264
You're breaking up the feed!

01:41.309 --> 01:44.479
We had the media from all 50 states

01:44.562 --> 01:47.440
and nine foreign countries in big numbers.

01:48.066 --> 01:52.445
It was an unprecedented filming
of a trial of this nature.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.156
Three, two, one. Following exten--

01:55.240 --> 01:57.784
-Take ten.
-Four, three...

01:57.867 --> 01:59.077
-...two...
-...one.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.540
[theme music playing]

02:36.072 --> 02:37.657
[male bailiff] Order in court. All rise.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.578
The circuit court, second judicial circuit
of the state of Florida

02:41.661 --> 02:43.454
in the Leon County is now in session.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.416
The Honorable Edward D. Cowart presiding.
Be seated.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.837
We're conducting the public's business,
gentlemen,

02:50.920 --> 02:53.423
and we're gonna conduct it
in the sunshine,

02:53.506 --> 02:55.550
as we've said in Florida.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.262
[man] Nobody had ever handled
a case like this before,

02:59.345 --> 03:02.724
before the cameras
and certainly not before...

03:02.807 --> 03:05.560
um, the virtual nation watching.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.646
[man] What's all these cameras doing
on the court floor?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.065
What's these cameras doing
on the court floor?

03:13.693 --> 03:16.529
-Excuse me.
-[man] Get away from here! Get!

03:17.363 --> 03:18.990
[Simpson]
I was a young lawyer at the time.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.118
It was baptism by fire, if you would.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.329
But quite frankly, from my perspective,

03:24.412 --> 03:27.582
I had to treat it like it was
just another case.

03:28.958 --> 03:33.171
[man] I was the public defender
appointed to represent Ted Bundy.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.049
We didn't have any choice about the case.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.384
Mr. Bundy didn't have any money.

03:39.219 --> 03:43.306
When I first met Bundy, I had
an opportunity to speak with him...

03:43.723 --> 03:46.809
in a very small visiting room.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.687
And it was not altogether comfortable

03:49.771 --> 03:52.273
being at close quarters with him.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.860
It was, um, a little awkward,

03:56.653 --> 03:59.447
and, uh, maybe a little frightening.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.159
[Simpson] I've got a case. I got facts.

04:03.868 --> 04:07.080
I've got to deal with those facts,
and I've got to come up with a way

04:07.163 --> 04:11.251
to convince a jury that Theodore Bundy
committed these crimes.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.004
[Minerva] I felt the forensic evidence

04:15.088 --> 04:18.758
against Bundy was really pretty sketchy.

04:19.133 --> 04:24.555
The problem with Ted Bundy
was he was not a typical defendant

04:24.639 --> 04:26.599
because he was so infamous.

04:27.433 --> 04:31.521
The media had flooded
the whole state of Florida

04:31.604 --> 04:34.315
with all of this prejudicial publicity

04:34.399 --> 04:36.943
about what Ted Bundy had done.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.072
All the information goes a long way

04:41.155 --> 04:44.826
to destroying whatever public perception

04:44.909 --> 04:48.579
or belief
in "innocent until proven guilty".

04:50.832 --> 04:55.962
So my strategy was low-key, low-profile,

04:56.045 --> 05:00.174
have Ted Bundy do as little as possible.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.760
I may have described it as,

05:02.844 --> 05:07.181
"Just sit quietly and look innocent."

05:09.851 --> 05:12.937
[Simpson] Obviously, there was a great
deal of pressure on the prosecution,

05:13.021 --> 05:15.648
and nobody knew for sure
that we were going to be able

05:15.732 --> 05:17.942
to get a conviction ultimately in trial.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.695
And the one thing that we were
absolutely positive of

05:20.778 --> 05:23.698
is that we did not want Mr. Buddy
back on the streets again.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.411
[Minerva] The most important thing
was to save his life.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.539
I wanted to discuss the possibility

05:31.622 --> 05:34.417
of trying to negotiate a plea bargain

05:34.500 --> 05:38.338
that would result in him
being spared the death penalty.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.425
So I went and talked to him.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.012
[Bundy] He came into my cell
and he said, "Ted...

05:46.095 --> 05:49.849
I don't like the way this prosecution
against you is shaping up."

05:49.932 --> 05:54.187
It was his sincerest belief there was
no way I could be found not guilty.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.104
[Michaud] Mm-hmm.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.442
"They made the proposal," he said.
"An offer was made for you to make a plea

05:59.525 --> 06:01.778
in exchange for a life sentence."

06:02.362 --> 06:03.571
And it bothered me,

06:03.654 --> 06:05.782
because I felt like he was conceding
that I was guilty

06:05.865 --> 06:07.867
and all he was there for
was to save my life.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.080
I said, "Are you willing
to have us negotiate?"

06:12.163 --> 06:17.543
He said, "Yes, I can-- I can do a plea."
I was surprised when he said yes.

06:18.336 --> 06:22.173
[Simpson] We decided that it would be best
if we could resolve this case

06:22.256 --> 06:25.510
to have him enter a guilty plea
that would ultimately result

06:25.593 --> 06:28.679
in Mr. Bundy, uh, going to prison
for the rest of his life.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.226
[Bundy] I was under a lot of pressure.
A lot of pressure.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.229
I don't think I've been under
so much pressure that I can recall.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.189
A lot of pressure to take it.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.317
I mean, I'd be the last one to say
I want the death penalty. I don't.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.194
-[Michaud] Yeah.
-I mean, I would lay awake at night

06:43.277 --> 06:45.321
worrying that this was going
to happen to me.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.785
[Katsaris] Ted Bundy
was concerned about losing his life.

06:50.868 --> 06:55.248
And it got out, of course,
that there may have been a deal struck.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.542
It went like wildfire.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.677
[Minerva]
The courtroom was full of people,

07:07.760 --> 07:11.097
even though our agreement
with the state was,

07:11.180 --> 07:12.974
"Let's don't have a big show.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.102
As few people as possible."
But it was packed.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.648
[Bundy] In that room full
of law enforcement officers and...

07:20.982 --> 07:24.110
Katsaris and the head of the state patrol
sitting right up in front,

07:24.694 --> 07:25.987
uh, in front of God and everybody

07:26.070 --> 07:30.283
just looking like cats
that had just swallowed the canary.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.202
Well, we went into court that morning

07:33.286 --> 07:36.873
thinking Mr. Bundy was going
to enter a plea, and, uh...

07:37.457 --> 07:39.333
We got there,
and the first thing that happened

07:39.417 --> 07:41.752
was Mr. Bundy stood up
and started making a speech.

07:42.753 --> 07:47.091
It's my position that my counsel,
one, believe that I am guilty.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.886
Two, that they have told me
they see no way

07:49.969 --> 07:51.512
of presenting effective defense,

07:51.971 --> 07:54.265
and on no uncertain terms
they have told me that.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.435
And three, that they see no way
of avoiding conviction.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.188
Your Honor, if that does not raise itself

08:00.271 --> 08:02.940
to the level of ineffectiveness
of counsel, I don't know what does.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.820
[Minerva]
He sabotaged the plea and turned it down.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.363
I mean it was...

08:10.406 --> 08:12.241
demoralizing to me.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.786
-[Bundy] I skewered Mike.
-[Michaud] Yeah.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.663
[Bundy] Pretty rigorously.
-[Michaud] Uh-uh.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.292
And I, at no time, ever did I intend
to plead guilty to anything.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.128
[Michaud] You've got
a sense of drama, Ted. [laughs]

08:24.712 --> 08:28.299
No way could I stand up in front of a jury

08:28.382 --> 08:31.135
and try to convince them
that he was not guilty

08:31.219 --> 08:34.597
when he said I had told him
I believed he was guilty.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.265
I mean, there was no...

08:36.349 --> 08:38.142
no credibility there at all.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.979
I talked to Mr. Minerva
after court that day

08:42.563 --> 08:44.857
and I just looked him in the face
and I said,

08:45.566 --> 08:47.944
"Bundy just gave up
the deal of a lifetime."

08:49.695 --> 08:53.241
[Minerva]
I finally filed a motion to withdraw.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.660
But the judge would not let us out.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.538
[male reporter] Judge Cowart,
not in the mood for more delays

08:58.621 --> 09:00.873
decided Minerva should stay.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.710
I'm going to deny the motion
to substitute counsel,

09:04.794 --> 09:08.089
and I am likewise going to deny
the motion to withdraw.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.176
[Minerva]
So I stayed involved in a limited way

09:12.260 --> 09:14.971
in the role of advisory council.

09:15.805 --> 09:20.851
And because Bundy was so insistent
on taking part in the case,

09:20.935 --> 09:24.730
the judge allowed him to be co-counsel,

09:25.189 --> 09:27.567
which is a fiction,
because he wasn't a lawyer.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.736
[Hula] He always knew best.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.574
I think he believed he knew better
than any other lawyer.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.369
And after he rejected the plea bargain,

09:38.452 --> 09:41.455
we got the idea
that he was not going to be

09:41.539 --> 09:44.667
a person to take these charges
sitting down.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.003
[male reporter]
You gonna try for another attorney?

09:47.628 --> 09:50.214
Are you gonna represent yourself,
or are you gonna get another attorney?

09:50.298 --> 09:53.718
I'm staying with the man I know best
right now, and that's me.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.013
[camera shutters click]

10:08.566 --> 10:11.611
[newswoman] The State of Florida
is going to officially begin

10:11.694 --> 10:14.030
testing its case against
Theodore Robert Bundy.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.907
[male reporter] It was pre-trial publicity
which brought the Bundy trial

10:16.991 --> 10:18.242
from Tallahassee to Miami.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.828
Too many people were familiar
with the details of the Bundy case.

10:20.911 --> 10:24.248
Bundy, who's accused of murdering
two Florida State University coeds,

10:24.332 --> 10:26.250
is acting as his own lawyer.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.588
[Bundy] I was really in control of myself.
I really felt good.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.465
There was just no problem.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.717
The new and improved Ted Bundy.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.138
How you doing?
Aren't you getting tired of Florida?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.766
[male bailiff] All rise, please.

10:42.266 --> 10:46.354
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
This honorable circuit court

10:46.437 --> 10:49.815
of the 11th judicial circuit of Florida
in Dade County is now open.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.692
The Honorable Judge Cowart presiding.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.528
Please be seated.
Court will come to order.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.032
[male reporter]
Today, the Bundy trial has begun.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.201
and there's a new member
on the defense team:

11:00.284 --> 11:02.203
attorney Margaret Good.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.121
[woman] After the failed plea,

11:04.205 --> 11:06.832
Mike Minerva is still
head lawyer on the case.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.752
However, he decided not to go to Miami,

11:09.835 --> 11:13.798
and Mike Minerva had requested me
to join the defense team.

11:14.548 --> 11:18.219
I was just a run-of-the-mill, idealistic,
young criminal defense lawyer,

11:18.302 --> 11:21.430
when asked to do a very difficult job,
said, "Yes, I'll do it."

11:22.306 --> 11:25.017
We took the position
that Ted was incompetent.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.645
He didn't understand
the evidence against him.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.272
It's a basic principle of our law

11:30.356 --> 11:33.317
that you don't try a person
when they are incompetent.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.947
I thought Bundy
was very competent, very capable,

11:38.406 --> 11:41.450
and we did have a competency hearing.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.329
[Good] And the judge, remarkably,
ruled that he is competent.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.624
[reporter] Unlike most murder trials,
this one will feature the defendant

11:48.708 --> 11:51.961
helping four public defenders
in cross-examining witnesses.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.799
[Good] Judge Cowart ruled that not only
was Ted competent to stand trial,

11:56.882 --> 11:58.884
but that he was in charge of the defense.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.930
And it was
just a very difficult situation,

12:03.013 --> 12:04.306
because there were times

12:04.390 --> 12:09.770
when he was very erratic,
impulsive and, um, strange.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.441
[Judge Cowart]
Specifically, what do you seek, Mr. Bundy?

12:14.525 --> 12:17.236
Well, specifically, Your Honor,
I'm seeking...

12:18.487 --> 12:20.448
daily outdoor exercise.

12:21.323 --> 12:25.453
[Good] You know, we couldn't control
his impulses in his irrationality,

12:25.536 --> 12:29.165
anymore than he could control it,
and it was annoying

12:29.248 --> 12:32.752
and it was different and we had
no training in how to handle it.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.379
[reporter] Earlier today,
Bundy directly asked the judge

12:35.463 --> 12:38.549
for more exercise,
more access to the jail's law library,

12:38.632 --> 12:41.427
more conference periods,
and the use of a typewriter.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.513
He was always deferring and deflecting

12:44.597 --> 12:47.808
to draw the attention
away from the case.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.352
[Simpson]
One of my favorite motions that he filed

12:50.436 --> 12:52.897
was a motion for a change of menu,

12:52.980 --> 12:56.734
arguing that he had eaten
the same grilled cheese sandwich every day

12:56.817 --> 13:00.404
for the last five or six days,
and he just really needed something else.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.740
[reporter] This morning,
he said his living conditions at the jail

13:02.823 --> 13:04.825
prevent him from helping his attorneys.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.661
The light source
is totally inadequate to read by.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.874
The only way one can read in that cell
is to hold the document outside the bars

13:11.957 --> 13:14.543
and read the document
in the available light that filters

13:14.627 --> 13:16.879
from the light source outside the cell.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.299
[reporter] During a noon recess,
Judge Cowart visited Bundy's cell

13:20.382 --> 13:22.051
and said the lighting was bad.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.262
He told jailers, "I'd hate to have
to read in it myself."

13:25.346 --> 13:26.972
He then ruled
that Bundy should be transferred

13:27.056 --> 13:28.933
to this nearby conference room.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.686
[Hula] He thought
he was clever enough and smart enough

13:32.770 --> 13:36.273
and cunning enough to avoid conviction.

13:36.357 --> 13:40.528
He had, I guess,
just enough knowledge of the law

13:40.611 --> 13:42.947
to know what to do,

13:43.030 --> 13:45.449
but not enough to keep him out of trouble.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.579
Come over here, please.
Step onto the witness box.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.705
Raise your right hand.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.124
[clerk] Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you're about to give

13:54.208 --> 13:55.960
is the whole truth, nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

13:56.043 --> 13:56.877
I do.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.880
[Simpson] Officer Ray Crew
was one of the first officers

13:59.964 --> 14:02.633
that arrived at the Chi Omega house
that morning.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.177
I put him on the witness stand
to kind of...

14:05.928 --> 14:07.638
uh, set the scene, if you would.

14:08.347 --> 14:12.184
I began a room-by-room search
to see if there were any other victims...

14:12.268 --> 14:13.894
or potential witnesses.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.773
And I started at the northwest corner
of the north hall.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.402
[Simpson] Because I had
crime scene people still coming,

14:21.485 --> 14:22.778
I had not gone into detail.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.405
[Simpson]
No further questions, Your Honor.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.866
[Judge Cowart] Mr. Bundy?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.287
[Simpson] Out of the clear blue sky,
for some reason,

14:31.370 --> 14:34.832
Mr. Bundy decided that he was going
to cross-examine that witness

14:34.915 --> 14:38.085
about what the crime scene
looked like at the Chi Omega house.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.671
[Bundy] You testified here this morning
that you recall arriving

14:40.754 --> 14:44.341
at the Chi Omega house
at approximately 3:26 a.m.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.301
[Crew] Yes, sir.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.971
[Bundy] Then,
to the best of your recollection,

14:49.054 --> 14:52.099
step-by-step if you can, officer,
what did you do next?

14:53.350 --> 14:54.393
Step-by-step...

14:54.476 --> 14:57.438
I went in room four, and there was a--

14:57.521 --> 14:59.064
I observed a young lady lying

14:59.523 --> 15:00.816
on her right hand side,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.610
basically face down, the sheet pulled up.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.237
Initially, I observed a puncture wound...

15:05.571 --> 15:07.364
through the nipple on her right breast.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.410
Um, when the sheet was pulled off,
she was moved to the floor,

15:11.702 --> 15:13.078
I observed a...

15:14.079 --> 15:16.874
bloody mark on her right buttocks.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.461
[Simpson] I've never seen
anything like that before in my career.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.047
You would never, if you were a lawyer,

15:23.631 --> 15:27.134
want your client to cross-examine

15:27.217 --> 15:29.219
a crime scene witness.

15:29.970 --> 15:34.475
He was bringing out the gore
that he had left there.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.976
[Bundy] Did you touch Miss Bowman?

15:36.852 --> 15:39.563
No sir, I didn't touch her body, I re--

15:39.647 --> 15:42.191
lifted the covers back
so that I could observe.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.152
[Bundy] And can you describe what you saw
when you lifted up the covers?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.904
As much detail as you can recall.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.490
If you need to use report,
please feel free to do so.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.700
[Crew] She was lying,

15:52.493 --> 15:53.911
basically face down.

15:54.453 --> 15:58.290
There was a considerable amount of blood
around her head.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.626
There was what appeared to be

16:01.168 --> 16:04.129
a nylon stocking netted around her neck.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.341
Her head was bloated, discolored,

16:07.424 --> 16:10.678
one of her eyelids was raised,
her eyes appeared a little glassy.

16:11.804 --> 16:16.141
[Good] Asking him to relate
in excruciating detail

16:16.225 --> 16:19.228
what you saw when you first got there
over and over again...

16:19.770 --> 16:24.775
it could be perceived
that he had encountered the...

16:24.858 --> 16:27.820
crime scene before
and relished in what it looked like

16:27.903 --> 16:29.405
and wanted it repeated...

16:31.448 --> 16:32.700
is how it could be interpreted.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.619
[Bundy] Can you describe
the exact position,

16:35.703 --> 16:37.246
as best as you can recall,

16:37.329 --> 16:40.833
of Miss Levy's body as you saw it
when you first entered the room?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.585
[Simpson]
Objection, repetition, Your Honor.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.046
[Cowart] He's previously described that,
Mr. Bundy.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.131
[sigh]

16:48.507 --> 16:50.259
[woman clears throat]

16:51.260 --> 16:53.178
Recall the position of her arms.

16:54.722 --> 16:59.018
[Bundy] If we recognize
that the person of this type

16:59.101 --> 17:02.730
could receive gratification
in the act of killing itself,

17:02.813 --> 17:06.900
it's reasonable to assume at a later point
he might dwell on that,

17:06.984 --> 17:10.070
because it fits into the-- it might fit
into the fantasy structure.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.071
[Michaud] Mm-hmm.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.827
It was just very, um, unsettling,

17:17.453 --> 17:19.955
did not seem to be in Ted's best interest.

17:20.497 --> 17:25.335
And it put us, the defense attorneys,
in a particularly difficult situation.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.630
[female report] There are reports
of unrest in the defense camp

17:28.714 --> 17:33.427
as the lawyers quarrel among themselves
on who should do key cross-examinations.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.972
[male reporter] The jury is unaware
of the squabbles amongst the defense team,

17:37.056 --> 17:39.433
and these conflicts
have apparently not affected the way

17:39.516 --> 17:41.935
the defendant views
his chances of acquittal.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.983
[Simpson] I did not have
any strong forensics on this case,

17:48.067 --> 17:51.445
but we had
a positive identification of Mr. Bundy

17:51.904 --> 17:54.198
as the one that committed the crimes.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.366
[clerk] Do you solemnly swear
that your testimony

17:56.450 --> 17:58.494
is the whole truth, nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

17:58.577 --> 18:00.496
-I do.
-[Cowart] Please be seated.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.832
Nita Neary was, I thought,
one of the best witnesses that we had.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.960
[Simpson] Do you recall
the man that you saw

18:07.044 --> 18:09.213
at the door of the Chi Omega house

18:09.296 --> 18:12.508
on the morning of January 15, 1978?

18:13.717 --> 18:14.635
Yes, I do.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.638
Could you describe the man
that you saw at the door?

18:17.721 --> 18:20.099
Yes, he had a very prominent nose

18:20.182 --> 18:24.186
a straight bridge
that almost came to a point,

18:24.269 --> 18:26.230
not quite, uh,

18:26.313 --> 18:30.275
very thin lips, um, clean-shaven.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.404
I commented earlier,
nice looking for most, if you want.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.907
[Simpson]
And is that man in the courtroom today?

18:37.658 --> 18:38.826
Yes, he is.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.911
Would you point him out for us, please?

18:45.457 --> 18:48.794
[Simpson] I thought that she gave
a very compelling testimony.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.923
And one of the most important pieces
of evidence in my mind

18:53.006 --> 18:56.093
was she sat down with an artist

18:56.176 --> 18:59.847
and she described
the profile view of the man.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.307
You can hold that sketch
up next to Mr. Bundy,

19:02.391 --> 19:05.310
and it is a spitting image of Mr. Bundy.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.439
[Minerva]
The sketch was not very detailed,

19:09.523 --> 19:11.525
but was almost like a stick figure.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.403
It didn't amount to conclusive proof.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.949
[man] Did you ever have any direct,
eye-to-eye contact with the man?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.075
No.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.953
[Haggard]
Did you see the man's facial expression?

19:24.037 --> 19:24.955
No.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.916
Did you see the man's eyes?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.834
No.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.378
[Haggard] Did you see the man's eyebrows?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.463
I can't remember that now.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.507
Did you see the man's ears?

19:35.591 --> 19:36.425
No.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.802
[Haggard] Did you see the man's hair?

19:38.886 --> 19:39.720
[Neary] No.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.223
I had a few seconds to observe...

19:44.224 --> 19:45.934
the entire man.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.981
[Good] Bob Haggard did
an excellent job on cross-examination.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.902
Her testimony was not very certain.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.863
And right after Robert Haggard

19:57.946 --> 20:00.616
did that very,
very excellent cross-examination

20:00.699 --> 20:02.326
destroying the state's case,

20:02.784 --> 20:06.914
Ted got up in open court
and tried to fire Haggard as his attorney.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.834
[Bundy] Attempts by me
to participate in the courtroom

20:10.918 --> 20:14.713
have been met with vigorous opposition
from a part of my counsel.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.924
This is more-- [clears throat]

20:17.007 --> 20:21.345
We are speaking more to a problem
that attorneys have of giving up power.

20:21.929 --> 20:26.225
Maybe we're dealing with a problem
of professional psychology,

20:26.308 --> 20:28.268
where the attorneys are so jealous

20:28.352 --> 20:30.520
of the power they exercise
in the courtroom,

20:31.021 --> 20:32.940
they're afraid to share it
with the defendant.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.026
[reporter] Then, the defense attorney
Robert Haggard, without explanation

20:36.109 --> 20:38.737
asked to be excused
and walked out of court.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.405
[Cowart] And then there were three.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.324
[courtroom laughs]

20:42.407 --> 20:44.076
[Good] Ted was not a well person.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.537
If ever there was a decision to be made
that would benefit the defense

20:47.621 --> 20:48.789
or benefit the state,

20:48.872 --> 20:51.291
Ted would always choose the one
that benefited the state.

20:52.042 --> 20:56.129
My feeling is
that the lawyer should control

20:56.213 --> 20:57.839
the defense of the case

20:57.923 --> 20:59.549
by virtue of their experience.

21:01.969 --> 21:05.180
[Hula]
We were seeing here a real crime drama.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.767
It was just sordid, lurid,
sensational enough

21:09.351 --> 21:11.937
that I think people wanted to watch it

21:12.020 --> 21:15.816
replay every day during the trial.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.986
[male reporter] Each day,
the courtroom is filled with spectators

21:19.069 --> 21:21.697
drawn by a fascination
with Theodore Bundy himself,

21:21.780 --> 21:24.116
or by the gruesome details of the crimes.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.077
What is unusual to see
is that many of the onlookers

21:27.160 --> 21:28.412
are women. Young women.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.664
[Good] Women would slip notes to me

21:30.747 --> 21:32.207
and ask me to give them to Ted.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.127
You know, I would say,
"No, I can't do that."

21:35.794 --> 21:38.171
[man] Are you little scared
when you look at him?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.590
Yes. Scares me to be
in the same room with him,

21:40.674 --> 21:42.384
but I know there's other people in there.

21:42.926 --> 21:45.721
I'm not afraid. He just doesn't look
like the type to kill somebody.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.640
Everytime he turns around,
I kinda get that feeling, "Oh, no!"

21:48.724 --> 21:51.059
You know? [chuckles] "Gonna get me next."

21:51.143 --> 21:53.812
-But yet, you are fascinated by him.
-Very. Very.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.857
-Why do you do it?
-I don't know. [chuckles]

21:59.276 --> 22:01.862
[reporter] One woman who has been
at the trial for the past four days

22:01.945 --> 22:05.574
and who frequently confers with Bundy
has another impression entirely.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.368
Carole Boone believes Bundy
is completely innocent.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.454
Some have called her his girlfriend.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.665
She prefers be known
as just a close personal friend.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.836
[Michaud] Carole was
a friend of his from Washington.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.672
And Carole had reappeared in his life

22:21.006 --> 22:23.383
to actually act as his champion,

22:23.800 --> 22:26.345
because she felt
that he was telling the truth

22:26.428 --> 22:27.929
and that he was being railroaded.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.974
She was Ted's advocate.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.642
That was her identity.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.021
She felt maternal towards him
to some extent.

22:37.230 --> 22:41.109
And she was adamant
that her Bunny, as she called him,

22:41.485 --> 22:43.695
was, uh, wholly innocent.

22:44.071 --> 22:48.492
Let me put it this way. I--
I don't think that Ted belongs in jail.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.244
The things in Florida don't concern me...

22:51.787 --> 22:53.955
any more than the things out west do.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.626
-And those other things--
-You think these are trumped-up charges?

22:59.211 --> 23:03.173
I don't think they had reason
to charge Ted Bundy with murdering

23:03.256 --> 23:06.259
in either Leon County or Columbia County.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.721
[reporter] Boone says she has twice
been allowed to visit Bundy in jail

23:09.805 --> 23:12.307
since he was brought to Miami
six days ago.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.644
She describes him as nervous,
but cautiously hopeful.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.981
[man] Are there any dates set
on any other trials?

23:20.065 --> 23:22.025
-Pardon me?
-Even with acquittal?

23:22.109 --> 23:23.318
[laughs]

23:23.402 --> 23:25.695
Yes, well...

23:25.779 --> 23:26.905
You know,

23:27.906 --> 23:29.783
if I was a football coach,
I'd say you don't--

23:29.866 --> 23:31.743
When you're
in the first game of the season,

23:31.827 --> 23:33.703
you don't start looking
for the Super Bowl.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.664
[courtroom laughs]

23:38.458 --> 23:41.294
[Katsaris] I believe he thought
he was going to get away with this.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.214
But the piece of evidence
that was going to be

23:44.297 --> 23:47.259
the centerpiece of the prosecution,

23:47.342 --> 23:50.679
that would be used for the first time
in a court setting,

23:51.221 --> 23:52.472
was the bite marks.

23:53.974 --> 23:57.602
There was a very large, very imprinted

23:58.103 --> 24:00.063
double bite mark.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.483
The person bit, withdrew,

24:03.567 --> 24:08.738
and... bit again,
as hard as the person could.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.453
[Simpson] And the question became
whether or not there was any way

24:14.536 --> 24:17.706
that a suspect could be identified
from that bite mark.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.625
[Simpson] Could you please
state your name for the record?

24:20.709 --> 24:22.043
My name is Richard Souviron.

24:27.924 --> 24:28.925
[Simpson] What is that?

24:29.009 --> 24:31.553
This is a stone cast
of Mr. Bundy's upper teeth.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.473
[reporter] The State's star witness,
Dr. Richard Souviron,

24:34.556 --> 24:36.183
a Miami forensic odontologist,

24:36.266 --> 24:38.894
showed the court the peculiarities
of Bundy's teeth.

24:39.269 --> 24:43.398
Slightly crooked upper front teeth
with distinct incisors and chip marks.

24:43.940 --> 24:47.694
Whoever made this mark
in the skin, in the flesh,

24:47.777 --> 24:49.070
had crooked teeth.

24:49.779 --> 24:53.492
[Katsaris] I believe it was
the canine teeth that were very distinct,

24:53.575 --> 24:56.161
that really, uh, were different.

24:57.537 --> 25:01.041
[Minerva] It was obvious
that the jury was affected

25:01.124 --> 25:04.544
by the big show put on by the prosecution.

25:04.628 --> 25:07.047
But we really concentrated hard

25:07.589 --> 25:11.760
on trying to limit the scope
of that testimony.

25:12.719 --> 25:17.349
[Good] Mike did come down to Miami
and handled the bite-mark evidence.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.935
It was the first time
that kind of "tool-mark evidence"

25:20.018 --> 25:21.853
had been used in a criminal case.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.315
And he was the expert,
legally speaking, on that.

25:26.107 --> 25:29.277
[Minerva]
Bite-mark evidence is not like DNA.

25:30.028 --> 25:33.323
It's now pretty much considered
junk science.

25:34.449 --> 25:38.912
[Good] This idea that you could
positively identify someone

25:39.579 --> 25:43.458
from the bruise pattern
they would leave on human flesh,

25:43.875 --> 25:45.877
it was just gross speculation,

25:46.586 --> 25:49.047
but it didn't change what happened.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.842
[Minerva] Can you tell us with any
reasonable degree of dental certainty

25:52.926 --> 25:54.511
that those teeth...

25:55.470 --> 25:57.764
made the marks on those photographs?

25:59.516 --> 26:00.350
Yes, sir.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.854
[Minerva] And what is that opinion, sir?

26:06.731 --> 26:08.024
They made the marks.

26:10.777 --> 26:13.405
[Bundy] I mean,
I felt the tide turn right there.

26:13.488 --> 26:16.658
They may have been
somewhat ambivalent up to--

26:17.409 --> 26:21.913
in the State's case-- up until the point
when the State's witnesses testified.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.250
And then our failure
to effectively refute that,

26:25.333 --> 26:28.962
I think, was--
was very significant to the jurors.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.800
I was feeling embittered

26:33.883 --> 26:36.052
and-- and, uh, persecuted.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.806
I couldn't endure this-- this humiliation.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.142
I had to make a statement.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.777
[male reporter] The jurors
were out of the courtroom this morning

26:52.861 --> 26:56.990
when Judge Edward Cowart received word
from one of Theodore Bundy's guards

26:57.073 --> 27:01.995
of an incident at the Dade County Jail
involving the defendant last night,

27:02.078 --> 27:04.205
which also explained his absence
from the court

27:04.289 --> 27:06.416
at the start of this morning's session.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.334
Go ahead.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.753
[guard] This morning, I went
to Mr. Bundy's cell to awaken him

27:09.836 --> 27:11.504
so he could get dressed to come to court,

27:12.088 --> 27:13.590
I could not get him to get up.

27:13.673 --> 27:17.093
I noticed that the lock had been jammed
with what appeared to be toilet paper

27:17.177 --> 27:19.137
Was this form the inside of the cell or--

27:19.220 --> 27:20.805
From the outside, Judge...

27:20.889 --> 27:24.309
He had a wet toilet paper
and had stuffed it in the lock

27:24.392 --> 27:27.354
and kept it from locking.
He was different.

27:27.437 --> 27:30.440
And he was smart, and he...

27:30.940 --> 27:32.525
He was a challenge to the best.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.695
[Cowart] The court will find him
in contempt of this court

27:35.779 --> 27:38.031
for failing to be here at this time.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.534
And I want to instruct counsel
to go talk to Mr. Bundy.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.870
And it's now ten minutes after nine.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.123
This court will reconvene at 9:30,
and we'll continue,

27:47.207 --> 27:48.500
whether he's here or not.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.169
[bailiff] Everybody, remain seated.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.088
[Simpson] At that point in time,

27:53.171 --> 27:55.173
things were going good
for the prosecution.

27:55.256 --> 27:56.925
So it was real obvious

27:57.300 --> 28:00.178
he was trying to do something
to change that.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.806
[reporter]
Just past 9:30 this morning,

28:02.889 --> 28:05.975
Theodore Bundy entered the court
before Judge Cowart.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.770
-[Cowart] Mr. Bundy?
-Yes, sir.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.856
[Cowart] The court wants to talk to you
a minute. Come up to the bar here.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.025
What happened?

28:14.401 --> 28:16.403
-[Bundy clears throat]
-What happened?

28:16.486 --> 28:18.697
[Bundy] Where? Do you mean in the jail?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.701
[Cowart] The court
was supposed to start at nine o'clock.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.661
I wanna tell you something, young man,

28:24.744 --> 28:27.956
and I wanna tell you clearly
and unequivocally so you understand.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.627
This court
is not gonna follow your schedule.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.506
This court is gonna set the time
when we convene

28:36.589 --> 28:38.508
and when we do not convene.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.928
The court has already found you
in contempt of this court.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.639
Be forewarned,
I'm not tolerating any more of this.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.016
Is there any question in your mind?

28:47.684 --> 28:50.979
[Bundy] Perhaps the court can tell me
how I can hold the jail in contempt?

28:52.188 --> 28:56.276
[Cowart] You can quit breaking lights
and stuffing toilet paper in a lock,

28:56.359 --> 28:58.611
that's how you
can not hold them in contempt.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.447
[Bundy]
What I'm saying to you, Your Honor,

29:00.530 --> 29:03.032
is I'm laboring under conditions...

29:04.033 --> 29:07.245
which are causing me stress
which this court is not aware of.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.414
The conditions imposed upon me

29:09.789 --> 29:11.875
by the Dade County Jail
constitute harassment.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.043
It is an attempt by the system,

29:14.127 --> 29:17.213
I think, to coerce me, to wear me down.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.966
Since I have been in Dade County,
I've been allowed--

29:20.049 --> 29:22.135
[Cowart]
Don't point your finger at me, young man.

29:22.218 --> 29:24.929
Don't shake your finger at me, young man!

29:25.013 --> 29:26.473
[Bundy] ...of one and one half hour--

29:26.556 --> 29:28.808
[Cowart] That's fine,
you can shake it at Mr. Haggard.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.185
[laughter]

29:30.268 --> 29:32.854
[Bundy] He probably-- He probably
deserves it better than you do.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.982
[Haggard] He occasionally
shakes his finger at me, Judge.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.401
[Bundy] This railroad train is running,
Your Honor.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.028
But if I wanna get off, I'll get off.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.655
If I need to demonstrate to the court

29:43.114 --> 29:45.617
that there are things happening
outside this courtroom

29:45.700 --> 29:47.994
that are influencing and affecting me.

29:48.077 --> 29:51.122
There comes a time
when I just have to say, "Whoa!"

29:51.831 --> 29:53.208
[Cowart] If you say "Whoa,"

29:53.291 --> 29:56.586
I'm gonna be using spurs
and overcome that whoa.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.588
-Giddy up, that's what--
-You bet.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.382
And this court is gonna proceed
on schedule.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.635
Bless your heart.
I just hope you stay with us,

30:03.718 --> 30:05.637
because if you don't, we'll miss you.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.388
-[laughter]
-All right?

30:11.267 --> 30:13.186
[Bundy]
I'm not going to try to please people.

30:13.269 --> 30:16.064
I hold my head high. I believe in myself.

30:16.815 --> 30:21.319
Dealing from that on out,
I know exactly what's what.

30:21.736 --> 30:24.489
And Lord knows I am the first
and foremost person

30:24.572 --> 30:26.783
who has personal, intimate knowledge

30:27.283 --> 30:29.994
that it couldn't be me,
that it's not me, that I'm innocent.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.997
And I'll lay my money on me.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.718
[Cowart] Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

30:45.802 --> 30:49.973
Counsel will now be making
their closing arguments to you,

30:50.056 --> 30:51.766
their final arguments.

30:52.433 --> 30:56.229
The evidence in this case
presents many reasonable doubts.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.983
It's a sad day for our system of justice

31:00.066 --> 31:02.235
that can put a man's life on the line

31:02.694 --> 31:04.571
because they say he has crooked teeth.

31:05.446 --> 31:08.992
How tragic it would be
if a man's life to be taken from him

31:09.075 --> 31:13.872
because 12 people thought
that he was probably guilty,

31:14.289 --> 31:15.456
but they were not sure.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.210
[Good] You hope the jury would find
a reasonable doubt

31:19.294 --> 31:22.171
and find that this evidence
was insufficient and find him...

31:22.255 --> 31:24.465
not guilty of first degree murder.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.926
But you never know
what the jury's gonna do.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.054
[Simpson]
This man premeditated this murder.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.724
He knew what he was going to do
before he did it.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.477
He thinks he is smart enough

31:36.978 --> 31:38.897
to get away with any crime.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.315
Give him...

31:41.566 --> 31:43.943
the same amount of mercy

31:44.444 --> 31:47.864
that he gave Lisa Levy
and Margaret Bowman,

31:47.947 --> 31:50.950
which was absolutely none.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.163
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

31:55.622 --> 31:58.166
you may retire now
to consider your verdict.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.335
This case went to the jury
shortly before--

32:00.418 --> 32:01.920
Jury will deliberate until midnight--

32:02.003 --> 32:04.631
-Ted Bundy committed the--
-...arrested in Pensacola--

32:05.340 --> 32:08.384
It was exactly three hours ago
that Judge Edward Cowart

32:08.468 --> 32:10.595
gave the case to the jury.
They are now deliberating

32:10.678 --> 32:13.556
behind closed doors, inside the jury room,

32:13.640 --> 32:15.934
examining more than a hundred exhibits.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.063
[reporter] Are you confident
that he will be acquitted here?

32:20.688 --> 32:24.651
[sighs] I hope he will be acquitted.
I can't say I'm confident.

32:24.734 --> 32:28.071
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special report,

32:28.154 --> 32:30.740
live from the justice building
in Miami, Florida.

32:31.407 --> 32:34.160
Deliberating for six and a half hours,

32:34.243 --> 32:36.245
the jury returned to the courtroom,

32:36.329 --> 32:41.209
just past 9:30 Eastern time
Tuesday night to announce its decision.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.223
[indistinct chatter on TV]

33:02.105 --> 33:03.064
[man] Okay.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.775
Here we go, folks. I'm feeding.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.070
Have you reached the verdict, Madam Clerk?

33:11.030 --> 33:13.574
In the Circuit Court
of the Second Judicial Circuit

33:13.658 --> 33:15.159
of Leon County, Florida,

33:15.243 --> 33:17.578
case number 78670,

33:17.662 --> 33:20.498
the State of Florida
versus Theodore Robert Bundy, verdict:

33:20.581 --> 33:22.500
We, the jury
at Miami Dade County, Florida

33:22.583 --> 33:25.378
24th day of July A.D., 1979,

33:25.461 --> 33:27.797
find the defendant, Theodore Robert Bundy,

33:27.880 --> 33:30.258
as to count two of the indictment,
murder in the first degree

33:30.341 --> 33:32.593
upon one Margaret Bowman,
guilty as charged,

33:32.677 --> 33:34.470
as to count three of the indictment,

33:34.554 --> 33:38.016
murder in the first degree
upon one Lisa Levy, guilty as charged.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.601
So say we all... [unintelligible]

33:42.895 --> 33:45.857
[Bundy] They refuse
to perceive me as being anything

33:45.940 --> 33:47.442
that approaches being normal.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.194
They don't understand me.
They don't really understand me.

33:50.278 --> 33:53.322
They are missing, you know,
a very important point, I guess.

33:54.615 --> 33:58.578
[Good] When the verdict came in,
Ted, his demeanor, his expression,

33:58.661 --> 34:00.913
was completely different

34:01.289 --> 34:03.332
than how he had been throughout the trial.

34:03.416 --> 34:08.004
One of intense surprise,
which really just confirmed to me,

34:08.629 --> 34:11.674
that he did not have a rational
understanding of the proceedings

34:11.758 --> 34:15.803
or what was happening to him
or what was about to happen to him.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.849
[reporter] Ted Bundy is found guilty
of all seven counts of the indictment.

34:20.349 --> 34:23.728
That's includes three charges
of attempted murder

34:23.811 --> 34:26.272
and two counts of first-degree murder,

34:26.355 --> 34:30.359
a crime that is a capital offense
in the State of Florida,

34:30.443 --> 34:32.945
a crime for which he could be sent
to the electric chair.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.363
[indistinct chatter]

34:35.323 --> 34:36.491
[reporter] What's your reaction?

34:36.574 --> 34:40.620
We're very satisfied with what verdict
we did get in this case.

34:40.703 --> 34:43.664
We couldn't have expected it
to be any better than it was.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.335
[Simpson] It, uh, had been a long,
hard investigation, a long, hard trial.

34:47.418 --> 34:51.422
We knew that a lot of people
were pulling for us to win that case,

34:51.506 --> 34:55.468
and, uh, it was a tremendous relief,
uh, to know that we did.

34:55.551 --> 34:58.846
[man]
Come on, be calm, you guys, be calm.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.809
Needless to say,
I think the jury is totally wrong.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.727
They didn't take enough time.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.815
How could you consider all those
momentous decisions in six hours?

35:08.898 --> 35:10.399
It's just-- It's just impossible.

35:10.817 --> 35:14.112
It's wrong. We'll appeal it.
It's just... [sighs]

35:14.862 --> 35:15.863
What else can I say?

35:16.823 --> 35:19.492
We, the family, are devastated by this,

35:19.575 --> 35:22.286
but we'll stick behind him
because we know he's not guilty,

35:22.370 --> 35:23.704
as do all his friends.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.581
That's-- That's it.

35:26.707 --> 35:27.792
[man] Back up.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.671
[reporter] At 2:20 this afternoon,
the case was handed to the jurors

35:31.754 --> 35:33.798
with a decision before them
of whether to sentence

35:33.881 --> 35:37.260
convicted murderer Theodore Bundy
to life imprisonment or death.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.345
But it was the defendant's mother,
Louise Bundy,

35:39.428 --> 35:42.181
who made the most impassioned plea
for her son's life.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.184
My Christian upbringing tells me that,

35:45.268 --> 35:47.812
to take another's like
under any circumstances

35:47.895 --> 35:49.063
is wrong.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.942
And I don't believe the State of Florida
is above, uh...

35:54.026 --> 35:55.319
the laws of God.

35:59.031 --> 36:03.244
Ted can be very useful
in many ways, to many people,

36:04.829 --> 36:05.746
living.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.499
Gone from us

36:08.583 --> 36:12.170
would be like taking a part
of all of us and throwing it away.

36:13.921 --> 36:15.840
[Cowart] Defendant, please step forward.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.343
[bailiff] Bundy, step up the bar, please.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.141
[Cowart] The court finds
that of both these killings

36:25.224 --> 36:29.020
were indeed
heinous, atrocious, and cruel...

36:30.146 --> 36:32.565
and that they were extremely wicked,

36:32.648 --> 36:34.192
shockingly evil,

36:35.026 --> 36:39.238
vile, and the product of a design
to inflict a high degree of pain

36:39.322 --> 36:41.949
and utter indifference to human life.

36:42.491 --> 36:45.661
This court, independent of,
but in agreement with,

36:46.078 --> 36:48.331
the advisory sentence
rendered by the jury,

36:48.414 --> 36:50.458
does hereby impose the death penalty

36:51.250 --> 36:53.419
upon the defendant, Theodore Robert Bundy.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.256
-Take care of yourself, young man.
-[Bundy] Thank you.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.217
[Cowart] All right?
I say that to you sincerely.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.468
Take care of yourself.

37:01.260 --> 37:05.973
It's a tragedy for this court
to see such a total waste, I think,

37:06.057 --> 37:08.809
of humanity
that I have experienced in this court.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.436
You're a bright young man.

37:11.646 --> 37:12.897
You'd have made a good lawyer.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.107
I'd have loved to have you practice
in front of me,

37:15.191 --> 37:16.776
but you went another way, partner.

37:17.735 --> 37:18.819
Take care of yourself.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.031
I don't have any animosity to you,
I want you to know that.

37:22.573 --> 37:26.160
Court will be in recess
until Saturday morning at ten o'clock.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.622
[bailiff] Everybody remain seated
until the Judge is out of the courtroom.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.211
[Bundy] I don't really feel
like I have any really...

37:35.962 --> 37:38.714
acute insights or observations...

37:39.507 --> 37:41.509
analysis to add to...

37:42.468 --> 37:44.136
what's happened this afternoon.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.515
I am tired...

37:49.558 --> 37:50.434
sad.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.229
And even now I am...

37:53.813 --> 37:57.275
both fascinated with and angry at myself.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.652
for falling into that role.

38:13.207 --> 38:16.210
[reporter] There is yet another case
titled "The State of Florida

38:16.294 --> 38:18.713
versus Theodore Robert Bundy."

38:18.796 --> 38:20.631
[reporter #2] This time, Bundy is accused

38:20.715 --> 38:23.301
of killing Lake City school girl
Kimberly Leach.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.097
[man] The Kim Leach trial

38:28.514 --> 38:31.559
was the first murder case
that I actually tried as a prosecutor.

38:32.852 --> 38:37.648
People criticized us, saying,
"Why are you wasting the county's money

38:37.732 --> 38:40.860
prosecuting him, when he's
already got the death penalty?"

38:41.986 --> 38:43.279
You get two death penalties,

38:43.696 --> 38:46.198
you got twice as much chance
of one standing up,

38:46.282 --> 38:49.869
to make... sure, certain...

38:50.745 --> 38:51.829
that he was executed.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.791
The strategy of the trial was very simple.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.960
We had tons of evidence.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.547
There was an eyewitness that saw Bundy

39:01.630 --> 39:05.134
loading Kim Leach into the white van
at the junior high school.

39:05.593 --> 39:09.430
And in that white van that he was driving
was a bloodstain.

39:09.513 --> 39:12.308
The blood type was the same
as Kim's blood type.

39:13.476 --> 39:17.688
Numerous fibers from the clothing
from Kim Leach's body

39:17.772 --> 39:19.732
were found on the van carpet.

39:20.733 --> 39:24.737
Fibers from Bundy's blue blazer
were found on Kim's clothing.

39:25.529 --> 39:29.283
Shoe tracks. There was mountains
of evidence against him.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.619
[female reporter]
Wearing a blue bow tie and a big grin,

39:31.702 --> 39:34.413
Theodore Bundy faced the jury
for the last time.

39:34.830 --> 39:36.582
[Dekle] Bundy defended himself

39:37.041 --> 39:40.002
and that did not go over well
with the jury.

39:40.544 --> 39:43.047
He displayed
a tremendous amount of arrogance.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.591
One thing that he did was his...

39:46.175 --> 39:48.135
impromptu wedding ceremony

39:49.011 --> 39:50.888
between him and one of his witnesses,

39:51.389 --> 39:52.556
Carole Boone.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.476
[female reporter] The defense called
only one witness, Carole Boone.

39:55.559 --> 39:59.605
Acting as his own lawyer,
Bundy questioned her about his character.

39:59.688 --> 40:02.691
She said he's a kind, warm, patient man,

40:02.775 --> 40:04.693
a very positive part of her life.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.530
Then the convicted man
popped the question.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.742
-Carole, do you wanna marry me?
-[Boone] Yes.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.577
-And I wanna marry you.
-Yes.

40:15.329 --> 40:18.082
-And I do wanna marry you.
-[chuckles] You said you did.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.793
[female reporter]
Bundy went on questioning Boone.

40:20.876 --> 40:23.421
The prosecution called
the marriage proposal a charade

40:23.504 --> 40:26.382
and asked the jury to consider
the timing of the announcement.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.176
[Dekle] I thought at the time,

40:29.677 --> 40:31.512
this was simply a ploy.

40:32.263 --> 40:36.225
"How could you possibly vote
the death penalty on my wedding day?"

40:38.853 --> 40:42.022
The second thing he did was,
in the final argument before the jury,

40:42.440 --> 40:44.400
uh, he spread his arms out like this.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.694
He compared himself to Jesus.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.114
Well, the jury
didn't appreciate that at all.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.160
The next morning, we had a verdict.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.579
And, I was-- Man, I was pumped.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.831
I had been sweating bullets

40:59.248 --> 41:02.251
until the judge called us back
into to the courtroom.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.256
It is the sense of this court
as to count one of the indictment

41:07.339 --> 41:10.676
that you, Theodore Robert Bundy,
be adjudicated guilty of murder

41:10.759 --> 41:12.094
in the first degree

41:12.178 --> 41:15.556
and that you be sentenced to death
for the murder of Kimberly Diane Leach.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.225
[female reporter]
Bundy sat with his back to the judge

41:18.309 --> 41:19.810
during the reading of the recommendation.

41:19.894 --> 41:23.189
Then, one last outburst,
as the jury was being released.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.984
-[judge] The court is adjourned.
-Tell the jury that they were wrong.

41:27.067 --> 41:28.527
[man coughs]

41:28.611 --> 41:31.030
Denied. Bring the jury back.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.325
Get off! Let go of me.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.660
We're going to go to the holding cell.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.041
[Dekle] I feel that there are some people

41:42.124 --> 41:44.585
who by the enormity of their crime

41:44.668 --> 41:46.629
forfeit the right to live.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.634
He is such an evil person

41:51.717 --> 41:55.387
who had done so much harm,
hurt so many good people.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.140
He is just a...

41:59.141 --> 42:01.101
piece of garbage...

42:02.353 --> 42:03.854
in the shape of a human being.

42:15.991 --> 42:17.993
[indistinct chatter]

42:19.411 --> 42:21.413
[Michaud] When Ted went back to death row

42:21.830 --> 42:24.124
there was no guilt, no remorse.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.919
[Bundy] I don't feel guilty for any of it.
I feel less guilty now

42:27.002 --> 42:29.129
than I've felt at any time
in my whole life.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.589
About anything. I mean, really.

42:31.298 --> 42:35.052
And it's not that I've forgotten anything
or I've closed down part of my mind

42:35.135 --> 42:36.345
or compartmentalized.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.889
I believe I understand
everything that I've done.

42:40.099 --> 42:41.767
There was pride in what he did.

42:42.601 --> 42:45.354
[Bundy] I am in the enviable position

42:45.437 --> 42:47.940
of not having to feel any guilt.
And that's it.

42:48.274 --> 42:52.403
Guilt is this mechanism
we use to control people.

42:52.486 --> 42:53.821
It's an illusion.

42:53.904 --> 42:57.366
It's this kind of social control mechanism
and it's very unhealthy.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.454
[Michaud] Death row is a terrible place,

43:03.080 --> 43:04.873
so Ted would get drunk and smoke dope.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.086
[Bundy] There are a lot of guys
heavy into drugs up on death row.

43:09.169 --> 43:14.091
I smoked a lot of weed, and I have never
in my life been so fucked up.

43:14.174 --> 43:16.302
I don't like the dope
that just gets you mildly giddy.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.971
I mean, when I smoke dope,
I like to hallucinate a little bit.

43:19.513 --> 43:21.890
[Michaud]
Many days, he was really, really high.

43:22.975 --> 43:26.103
His wife, Carole,
would take drugs in to Ted...

43:26.729 --> 43:27.605
vaginally.

43:28.314 --> 43:33.152
And then he would take the drugs
back to his cell rectally.

43:33.235 --> 43:35.487
[Bundy] I'm gonna bring
some dope down here sometime,

43:35.571 --> 43:37.990
and we'll just smoke it.
And Valiums and alcohol.

43:40.075 --> 43:44.079
[Michaud] Ted and Carole
were the French expression folie à deux.

43:44.580 --> 43:45.914
They were crazy together.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.043
Carole loved him.

43:49.126 --> 43:51.420
She told him that she wanted a child,

43:52.338 --> 43:55.507
and somehow they had sex in the prison.

43:56.759 --> 43:58.719
[Boone] We kept looking out of the window.

43:58.802 --> 44:01.013
There was a black guard who was real nice.

44:01.555 --> 44:04.475
After the first day,
they just-- they didn't care.

44:05.017 --> 44:07.019
They walked in on us a couple of times.

44:07.936 --> 44:11.565
And they built
this little family on death row.

44:12.816 --> 44:15.778
Ted and Carole and little Rosa.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.657
[reporter] This convicted killer,
who fathered a daughter,

44:19.740 --> 44:24.203
tried to have a semblance of family life
with daughter, stepson, and wife.

44:26.038 --> 44:29.750
[Michaud] The narcissist in him
adored the attention.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.878
[Bundy] If you wanna interest someone,
let's say, in--

44:32.961 --> 44:36.048
in the screenplay rights,
the movie rights, film rights,

44:36.131 --> 44:37.925
news articles about me,

44:38.008 --> 44:40.010
the Rolling Stone stuff,
the New Times stuff,

44:40.094 --> 44:41.845
the New York Times magazine.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.639
As a media event,

44:43.722 --> 44:46.183
-to touch people throughout the country...
-[Michaud] Hm-hmm.

44:46.266 --> 44:47.768
...because people
throughout North America,

44:47.851 --> 44:52.439
really are-- to one degree or another,
know about Ted Bundy.

44:54.692 --> 44:58.070
I was really interested in putting Ted
in my rearview mirror.

44:59.113 --> 45:02.533
We'd recorded roughly a hundred hours
of recorded conversation.

45:02.783 --> 45:06.120
But if you listen to the tapes,
he never confessed.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.541
The last time I talked to Ted,
we said we were gonna publish the book.

45:13.168 --> 45:16.213
He said, "I don't care what you say,
as long as it sells."

45:17.798 --> 45:20.259
I was heartily sick of what I was hearing.

45:20.342 --> 45:21.719
I was sick of Ted.

45:21.802 --> 45:24.805
I walked out of that prison
with an enormous sense of relief.

45:24.888 --> 45:26.181
[birds chirping]

45:27.307 --> 45:30.310
[Aynesworth] Last time
I saw Ted Bundy or talked with him

45:30.728 --> 45:33.647
I was so damn sick of his lies

45:33.731 --> 45:36.775
and his denials of what he told us.

45:37.234 --> 45:39.319
Sometimes we'd come out of that prison

45:39.403 --> 45:42.072
and we'd be actually sick.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.325
I just was...

45:45.868 --> 45:47.161
tired of Ted Bundy

45:48.203 --> 45:50.873
and what he'd taken of my life, really.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.128
[Michaud] The book was about finished

45:56.211 --> 45:59.673
and we felt a responsibility
to his mother and stepfather

45:59.757 --> 46:01.884
to tell them
what Ted had been saying to us

46:01.967 --> 46:03.343
and what we were gonna publish
in the book.

46:04.845 --> 46:08.807
So, we fly to Seattle
and we have the tape recorder.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.810
Louise is sitting
next to the tape recorder.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.020
I'm sitting next to Louise.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.023
And Ted comes on, his voice comes on,

46:16.648 --> 46:18.317
and he's talking about murder.

46:19.485 --> 46:22.070
[Bundy] As he came up behind her,
she heard him, she turned around,

46:22.154 --> 46:23.739
and he brandished a knife.

46:23.822 --> 46:26.533
And, let's say,
he placed his hands around her throat.

46:27.201 --> 46:30.329
And Louise starts making
these little sounds,

46:30.788 --> 46:33.332
like a little mouse sounds,
little squeaks.

46:34.541 --> 46:36.877
And she just listened to it
and listened to it.

46:38.086 --> 46:40.464
Then we said, you know,
"Do you have any questions?"

46:40.964 --> 46:43.717
And neither one of them
had any questions whatsoever.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.470
So, we turned off the tape recorder,
and she stood up

46:46.553 --> 46:47.387
and she said,

46:47.888 --> 46:50.265
"Who's for apple pie and ice cream?"

46:51.225 --> 46:53.060
And we had apple pie and ice cream.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.312
And then we left.

47:11.203 --> 47:15.332
The nation's worst mass murderers
may yet make a contribution to society.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.125
They have supplied the raw data

47:17.209 --> 47:20.420
to help the FBI build a composite picture
of the mass killer

47:20.504 --> 47:21.922
and his victims.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.799
The bureau today said
a new computer center

47:23.882 --> 47:25.926
is being set up to analyze that data.

47:26.009 --> 47:29.680
Agents hope that this computer
will spot those subtle patterns

47:29.763 --> 47:31.682
that they have missed in the past.

47:31.765 --> 47:34.893
[reporter] Today, the FBI announced
the creation of a national center

47:34.977 --> 47:37.187
for analysis of violent crime.

47:37.271 --> 47:39.273
The center would use computers like these

47:39.356 --> 47:42.025
to look for patterns
in the methods of murder.

47:42.109 --> 47:44.570
Agents have already interviewed
38 convicted killers

47:44.653 --> 47:46.154
including Charles Manson,

47:46.238 --> 47:49.575
to put together profiles
on who kills and why.

47:54.496 --> 47:57.416
This is the case we got in today
down in North Carolina.

47:57.499 --> 48:00.502
Are we looking at post-mortem
or ante-mortem wounds?

48:00.961 --> 48:04.298
[standing agent] It is definitely
post-mortem mutilation to the breast area.

48:04.923 --> 48:07.759
[man, voice-over] At that time,
I had the privilege of joining

48:07.843 --> 48:11.346
the first class of full-time profilers
in that program.

48:11.930 --> 48:15.601
We would look at hundreds of cases
that were solved or unsolved

48:15.684 --> 48:19.563
to try to understand
the thought processes of the perpetrators.

48:19.646 --> 48:24.151
Not only how they develop their skills,
but how they evaded detection.

48:25.903 --> 48:30.824
We would go in and talk to serial killers,
serial child molesters, serial rapists,

48:31.366 --> 48:33.994
and Ted Bundy was
one of the ones that was chosen.

48:35.370 --> 48:37.623
[Michaud]
Ted's case taught law enforcement,

48:37.706 --> 48:40.000
specifically the FBI, that...

48:40.500 --> 48:43.837
their way of going
about these investigations

48:43.921 --> 48:45.297
was going to have to change

48:45.380 --> 48:48.091
because a new type
of criminal was emerging,

48:48.467 --> 48:50.093
typified by Ted Bundy.

48:50.427 --> 48:54.514
He was brand new
and absolutely frightening.

48:54.598 --> 48:57.142
We're learning these people
are good at what they do.

48:57.225 --> 48:58.185
They're very good.

49:00.145 --> 49:01.772
[Hagmaier] Ted Bundy was unique

49:01.855 --> 49:04.900
from most-- all other serial killers
that we were aware of.

49:05.317 --> 49:08.111
He had a degree in psychology.
He was very bright.

49:08.195 --> 49:10.948
He basically set the standard.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.408
He's the Jack the Ripper
of the United States.

49:14.534 --> 49:16.286
He just potentially

49:16.370 --> 49:20.832
was a tremendous source of intelligence
for us, if he would talk to us.

49:22.459 --> 49:24.503
The first time I talked to him,

49:24.586 --> 49:27.714
he had been on death row
for a number of years,

49:27.798 --> 49:30.384
but he was still not admitting
any of these crimes.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.260
He said, basically,

49:33.053 --> 49:35.681
"Who do you think you are
to come down here, in death row,

49:35.764 --> 49:38.934
pull me out of my cell and ask me stuff?"

49:39.017 --> 49:41.937
You know? "You're the FBI. You guys
know everything. You're the geniuses.

49:42.020 --> 49:45.107
You write the books. You write the papers.
What do you want from me?"

49:45.190 --> 49:47.943
I said, "I wanna be better.
I want to save lives.

49:48.402 --> 49:49.695
I want you to help me."

49:50.237 --> 49:51.780
And he just said...

49:53.615 --> 49:54.741
"They wanna kill me."

49:55.450 --> 49:56.910
And I said, "They wanna kill you?"

49:56.994 --> 49:58.578
And he said,
"The State of Florida wants to kill me.

49:58.662 --> 50:00.789
And you'd kill me too, wouldn't you?"

50:01.623 --> 50:05.085
And I said,
"I wouldn't take pleasure in it,

50:05.168 --> 50:07.379
but if it was my job to pull the switch...

50:08.088 --> 50:09.506
yeah, you're toast."

50:09.589 --> 50:12.509
And he just started looking at me
and laughing and said,

50:12.592 --> 50:15.804
"How many times do you think
I've asked that question to other people?"

50:15.887 --> 50:19.641
He said, "They all lie. They all said
they thought I should be a survivor."

50:20.058 --> 50:21.560
He said, "You told the truth."

50:21.977 --> 50:24.938
And that was the way we finished
our first discussion.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.481
They trusted me.

50:28.108 --> 50:31.153
In visits after that, I would go in...

50:31.653 --> 50:34.156
and he would have
newspaper clippings of murder cases,

50:34.239 --> 50:37.284
some of which I was working,
some of which I wasn't even familiar with.

50:37.367 --> 50:40.203
And he would say,
"Let's profile this case."

50:40.287 --> 50:41.872
And he-- he was very good.

50:41.955 --> 50:44.750
I mean, he would say, "I think
that guy would do this. Then he'd do that.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.502
I think maybe you guys
ought to do this or that."

50:47.586 --> 50:49.921
He talked about
how a lot of serial killers

50:50.005 --> 50:51.715
will return to their crime scene.

50:52.215 --> 50:54.509
He also talked
about leaving evidence behind

50:54.593 --> 50:56.636
that had nothing to do
with the crime scene

50:56.720 --> 50:58.138
that might throw them off.

50:58.847 --> 51:02.768
He confirmed a lot of things
that we suspected about serial killers,

51:03.185 --> 51:06.021
but he also gave us
a lot more things to think about.

51:14.654 --> 51:17.908
[male reporter] The state prison
in Florida, America's Sunshine State.

51:18.950 --> 51:20.160
This is death row.

51:21.161 --> 51:23.914
Prisoners here have been sentenced
to die in the electric chair.

51:24.498 --> 51:26.666
Some have been here
as long as 12 years.

51:26.750 --> 51:30.837
They could be executed tomorrow,
next week, perhaps never.

51:33.965 --> 51:37.135
[woman]
I became Ted Bundy's lawyer in 1986,

51:37.636 --> 51:41.348
when an associate came in and said,
"Well, there's this guy in Florida,

51:41.431 --> 51:43.475
and he has his execution scheduled,

51:43.975 --> 51:46.311
and we need someone to take that case."

51:47.646 --> 51:51.024
I was very clear about being opposed
to the death penalty,

51:51.108 --> 51:53.610
even for the most heinous crimes.

51:54.694 --> 51:58.198
Preventing the government
from killing people in my name,

51:58.615 --> 51:59.616
was...

51:59.699 --> 52:02.119
uh, one of the most important things
I could do.

52:02.744 --> 52:04.663
[newswoman]
Convicted murderer Ted Bundy

52:04.746 --> 52:06.414
is scheduled to die
in Florida's electric chair

52:06.498 --> 52:07.582
one week from today.

52:08.166 --> 52:09.709
[Nelson] Ted was on deathwatch,

52:09.793 --> 52:11.586
so there was no time to waste.

52:11.670 --> 52:13.505
Our strongest argument was the fact

52:13.588 --> 52:16.091
that Ted received
inadequate representation

52:16.174 --> 52:18.301
and that he was represented by himself,

52:18.385 --> 52:20.303
who was not competent...

52:20.387 --> 52:23.557
to either assist, or even worse,
in Chi Omega case,

52:23.640 --> 52:25.809
present his own defense.

52:26.685 --> 52:29.729
He truly had sabotaged his trials,

52:29.813 --> 52:33.775
and we were hoping to find
some clear mental illness

52:33.859 --> 52:36.695
that we could use as an issue in the case.

52:37.779 --> 52:39.322
Convicted murderer Theodore Bundy

52:39.406 --> 52:42.242
is taking new steps to avoid
Florida's electric chair.

52:42.701 --> 52:46.246
[male reporter] This is the first time
Ted Bundy has left Florida's death row

52:46.329 --> 52:48.123
since being sentenced to death.

52:48.206 --> 52:51.960
Armed guards brought Bundy to the hearing
to determine his mental competency.

52:52.502 --> 52:56.756
[Nelson] My associate Jim Coleman and I
were in desperate need of an expert

52:56.840 --> 52:58.049
to analyze Ted.

52:58.133 --> 53:00.218
[reporter] Are we talking
about incompetence to be his own lawyer

53:00.302 --> 53:01.928
or incompetence to stand trial?

53:02.012 --> 53:04.347
Uh, we're talking about competency
to stand trial.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.725
That kind of analysis had not happened

53:06.808 --> 53:11.104
during the trial because Ted believed
he was more than competent.

53:11.771 --> 53:15.275
[Bundy] I knew I wasn't crazy, insane,
or incompetent or anything else.

53:15.358 --> 53:18.486
I was insulted
by even the suggestion by my attorneys

53:18.570 --> 53:20.030
that we should consider the defense.

53:20.113 --> 53:22.157
They knew damn well I wasn't crazy.

53:22.240 --> 53:25.202
Doctor Dorothy Lewis,
the psychiatrist at Yale,

53:25.285 --> 53:29.289
was willing to begin
neurological testing on him.

53:29.372 --> 53:35.003
She specialized in understanding
the brain chemistry of violent men.

53:38.298 --> 53:40.008
And then she called me up to say,

53:40.091 --> 53:42.385
"Do you know that your client
is manic-depressive?"

53:43.094 --> 53:46.514
That was the first that we'd heard
any kind of actual diagnosis

53:46.598 --> 53:48.308
of a mental illness with Ted.

53:48.850 --> 53:52.103
He talked in terms of a voice in his head.

53:52.187 --> 53:55.023
And this voice
would start saying things about women.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.984
Dr. Lewis realized that this was during...

53:58.068 --> 54:00.320
the down-phase of his manic depression.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.114
And Ted, controlling his own defense

54:03.198 --> 54:05.784
was just a sign of his manic episodes.

54:07.369 --> 54:10.830
And he also started talking
about that he did not feel empathy.

54:10.914 --> 54:12.666
He did not feel love.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.919
Dr. Lewis was extremely confident

54:16.002 --> 54:19.881
that there was something unique
about Ted's brain that had led to this.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.968
Some unique brain chemistry,

54:23.051 --> 54:24.469
or even a tumor

54:24.552 --> 54:28.223
in a critical location
that blocked his empathy.

54:30.558 --> 54:32.018
So we got a stay of execution.

54:34.646 --> 54:37.649
Just six hours before his scheduled
execution in Starke, Florida,

54:37.732 --> 54:41.111
convicted killer Ted Bundy
won a 24-hour stay.

54:41.194 --> 54:45.115
[Nelson] The appeals in the case had
to go through so many layers of courts.

54:45.198 --> 54:47.242
They happened over a period of...

54:47.742 --> 54:48.576
three years.

54:52.205 --> 54:55.333
Serial killer Theodore Bundy
has escaped the chair once again.

54:55.417 --> 54:58.086
[reporter] Lawyers for Bundy
went to the court in a last-ditch effort

54:58.169 --> 55:01.965
to argue that he wasn't competent
to stand trial in 1980.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.675
[Nelson] But the public pressure

55:03.758 --> 55:07.304
and the political pressure
was unsurmountable.

55:07.971 --> 55:09.639
[reporter]
Eleanor Rose of Seattle believes

55:09.723 --> 55:11.266
Bundy killed her daughter, Denise.

55:11.349 --> 55:12.934
[woman] As far as Bundy goes...

55:13.018 --> 55:17.272
I hate him and I do want him
to get the electric chair.

55:18.148 --> 55:20.317
[Nelson] No court was gonna be the one

55:20.400 --> 55:23.111
to stand in the way
of Ted Bundy's execution.

55:25.780 --> 55:28.199
[reporter] Bundy's lawyers
were trying for a stay of execution

55:28.283 --> 55:30.869
in U.S. District Court today,
but were turned down this afternoon.

55:30.952 --> 55:34.539
This, after the Florida Supreme Court
rejected his appeal Friday.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.125
[Nelson]
We had won two stays of execution,

55:37.208 --> 55:40.795
and in the last case,
the Supreme Court denied the stay.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.757
[female reporter] Shortly after
the High Court's decision was announced,

55:43.840 --> 55:46.509
Florida Governor Bob Martinez
signed a new death warrant.

55:46.593 --> 55:49.763
He represents
why you have capital punishment.

55:55.226 --> 55:59.522
For ten years, Ted Bundy has been fighting
execution in Florida's electric chair.

55:59.606 --> 56:03.401
[male reporter] Bundy is scheduled to die
in the Florida electric chair on Tuesday.

56:04.444 --> 56:07.697
[Nelson]
On the last few days before the execution

56:07.781 --> 56:10.158
he decided to confess.

56:11.951 --> 56:15.747
[Bundy] I'm at the point finally
where I see that I'm going to have to...

56:15.830 --> 56:20.835
tell you and others everything I know
in regard to so-called unsolved cases.

56:21.586 --> 56:24.297
[Nelson] Ted always thought
that his knowledge of these crimes

56:24.381 --> 56:26.383
was his ace in the hole.

56:26.841 --> 56:30.720
That by offering to confess,
the governor would...

56:31.262 --> 56:33.056
delay his execution a few years.

56:33.556 --> 56:35.517
[Bundy] I am the only one
in possession of this information,

56:35.600 --> 56:37.185
and that's just the way it is.

56:37.268 --> 56:39.646
To do a proper job for everybody,

56:39.729 --> 56:41.356
I mean, I'm going to need some time.

56:42.899 --> 56:45.276
[Nelson] Jim and I thought
it was extremely foolhardy

56:45.360 --> 56:47.737
for him to publicly confess.

56:47.821 --> 56:51.616
I didn't think the governor would buy it.
I didn't think it'd stop his execution.

56:56.371 --> 56:59.624
[Keppel]
His attorney had called me in Seattle

57:00.208 --> 57:02.419
to please go down, talk to Ted.

57:03.378 --> 57:05.296
He wanted to confess.

57:05.964 --> 57:09.217
[Hagmaier] I was told
that he wanted to talk, so I went down.

57:09.300 --> 57:12.929
His purpose in doing this,
obviously, was to extend his life.

57:13.012 --> 57:15.306
Although I was not trying
to extend his life,

57:15.723 --> 57:20.186
my job was to kind of encourage him
to talk and remind him of things

57:20.270 --> 57:23.106
that might be applicable to the cases.

57:24.232 --> 57:26.067
[Hagmaier]
I'm here at Florida State Prison

57:26.151 --> 57:30.071
at Raiford, Florida, with Mr. Ted Bundy.

57:30.155 --> 57:32.323
We're having a meeting,

57:32.407 --> 57:36.035
and presently it's two days
prior to his scheduled execution date.

57:36.494 --> 57:39.414
You've been involved
in how many homicides?

57:39.497 --> 57:44.294
[Bundy] Well, we came up with 30.
I mean, we added up.

57:44.961 --> 57:48.715
It's late at night like you said,
but I think that's a fairly close figure.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.342
[Hagmaier] Would you just try to summarize

57:51.426 --> 57:55.138
what states they were in
and what periods of time?

57:55.680 --> 57:57.891
[Bundy] I just really
will summarize it, uh...

57:58.975 --> 58:03.271
California, Oregon, Washington,
Idaho, Utah, uh..

58:03.354 --> 58:04.898
Colorado, and Florida,

58:04.981 --> 58:09.360
between 1973 and...

58:10.320 --> 58:13.615
1978.

58:14.949 --> 58:17.660
[Hagmaier]
Of the 30 that you were involved in,

58:18.578 --> 58:22.123
can you-- You have an idea
of how many were actually buried?

58:24.375 --> 58:25.835
[Bundy] Well, that's a good question.

58:26.336 --> 58:27.670
Gee, ten?

58:28.463 --> 58:32.258
-[Hagmaier] Ten burials of the 30--
-That's roughly, I mean, I just-- I guess.

58:32.342 --> 58:33.218
[Hagmaier] Okay.

58:33.927 --> 58:37.263
In a couple of the cases,
and I'm not sure how many,

58:37.347 --> 58:40.308
but you opted
to sever the heads from the victims.

58:41.935 --> 58:45.146
And how many were there,
do you recall, of the 30, that...

58:45.688 --> 58:47.232
[Bundy] Perhaps half a dozen.

58:55.490 --> 58:57.325
[Keppel] Well, I was there two days.

58:57.742 --> 59:01.454
The first day, you know,
he's behind heavy glass

59:01.955 --> 59:05.041
and there's a kind of a mouth hole
you can talk through.

59:05.458 --> 59:07.752
And that's when he told me everything.

59:09.420 --> 59:11.756
-[Bundy] Can you-- Can you hear that?
-[Keppel] I can hear you.

59:11.839 --> 59:12.674
[Bundy] Oh, okay.

59:12.757 --> 59:19.389
I just said that the Hawkins girl's head
was severed and taken up the road about...

59:20.974 --> 59:22.475
[inhales]

59:22.559 --> 59:24.811
[exhales] 25 to 50 yards.

59:25.562 --> 59:32.193
And buried in a location about ten yards
west of the road on a rocky hillside.

59:33.027 --> 59:34.320
-Did you hear that?
-[Keppel] Mm-hmm.

59:39.659 --> 59:42.078
[Hagmaier] When he said
he was clearing his soul at the end,

59:42.161 --> 59:43.913
he wanted me to know that he...

59:44.581 --> 59:45.748
practiced necrophilia.

59:46.374 --> 59:49.961
That was something he never talked about
even the third person before that.

59:50.044 --> 59:52.505
[stuttering] You know,
the truth is-- is terrible.

59:52.589 --> 59:53.631
You know? It's terrible.

59:56.092 --> 59:57.385
[Nelson] We woke up in the morning

59:57.468 --> 1:00:01.139
and there all the newspapers are,
you know, "Ted reveals his secrets."

1:00:02.098 --> 1:00:03.099
At that point...

1:00:04.517 --> 1:00:07.103
I was really overcome with emotion.

1:00:08.354 --> 1:00:10.481
It was over, and we knew it was over.

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.192
[male reporter] After 11 years of silence,

1:00:13.276 --> 1:00:17.488
he has begun admitting
to over 30 killings in five Western states

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:20.074
he has always been suspected of.

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:23.036
[reporter #2] The confessions came
as a surprise to Bundy's mother.

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:24.162
[Mrs. Bundy] If he...

1:00:25.330 --> 1:00:27.457
killed all those lovely young women,

1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:30.168
we have several beautiful daughters
of our own.

1:00:30.668 --> 1:00:32.462
We know how we would feel.

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:34.964
[voice wavers]
And that's a terrible thing!

1:00:36.591 --> 1:00:38.384
And he wasn't raised that way.

1:00:40.386 --> 1:00:43.222
[reporter] This evening, the Florida
governor says he's fully confident

1:00:43.306 --> 1:00:45.558
Bundy will be executed tomorrow morning.

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:47.393
In the words of one other state official,

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:52.649
"This master manipulator won't be allowed
to make a mockery of the judicial system."

1:01:05.953 --> 1:01:08.665
[Hagmaier]
I was with him when he had gotten a call.

1:01:09.082 --> 1:01:11.250
It was his attorney saying that, uh,

1:01:11.334 --> 1:01:14.003
there were no more appeals.

1:01:16.631 --> 1:01:18.299
He knew he was going to die.

1:01:24.347 --> 1:01:26.933
[newsman] One of this country's
most notorious killers

1:01:27.016 --> 1:01:30.103
will be executed tomorrow morning
at the Florida State Penitentiary.

1:01:31.270 --> 1:01:34.732
[male reporter] Ted Bundy has
always received a lot of public attention.

1:01:34.816 --> 1:01:37.819
The day before his scheduled execution
was no different.

1:01:37.902 --> 1:01:40.279
Television crews are here
from across the country.

1:01:41.739 --> 1:01:44.450
[Hula] The day
before the execution of Ted Bundy,

1:01:44.826 --> 1:01:48.287
we had satellite trucks set up
all over the field.

1:01:49.122 --> 1:01:52.709
I think that was one of the first
big uses of satellite trucks

1:01:52.792 --> 1:01:54.502
to cover an event like that.

1:01:54.919 --> 1:01:58.089
-[honking]
-[whooping]

1:01:59.257 --> 1:02:01.175
[Hagmaier]
There were thousands of people outside.

1:02:01.259 --> 1:02:05.304
You could hear them inside,
even in the inner confines of the prison.

1:02:05.388 --> 1:02:08.474
[man chanting] ♪ Burn, Bundy, Burn! ♪

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:11.978
"Burn, Bundy, Burn! Burn, Bundy, Burn!"
They were setting fireworks off.

1:02:14.272 --> 1:02:17.275
I looked at Ted, and I said,
"Do you hear that out there?"

1:02:17.358 --> 1:02:19.068
And he goes, "They're crazy."

1:02:19.152 --> 1:02:22.196
He said, "They think I'm crazy.
Listen to all of them."

1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:23.322

♪ Goodbye ♪

1:02:23.406 --> 1:02:26.993

1:02:27.076 --> 1:02:30.329
[Bundy] Vengeance is
what the death penalty really is.

1:02:30.997 --> 1:02:34.709
Really, it's a desire of society
to take an eye for an eye.

1:02:35.126 --> 1:02:37.628
And I guess there's no cure for that.
That's a society's problem.

1:02:37.712 --> 1:02:40.047
Maybe we should find a cure
for society's problem.

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:44.719
Just down the road from the prison,
there're even Ted Bundy T-shirts for sale.

1:02:44.802 --> 1:02:46.763
This one says, "Burn, Bundy, Burn."

1:02:46.846 --> 1:02:49.348
-Thrown one in, huh?
-I'll give them to the girls.

1:02:49.432 --> 1:02:51.684
[Aynesworth]
I was in the crowd outside the prison.

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:53.478
It was almost like a carnival.

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:57.815
-Mr. Aynesworth, have you been in--
-No, I haven't seen Ted for a long time.

1:02:58.232 --> 1:03:00.026
We wrote
a very unfavorable book about him,

1:03:00.109 --> 1:03:02.069
and he doesn't care much for us.

1:03:02.153 --> 1:03:06.115
I was so happy to see him go.

1:03:06.574 --> 1:03:08.284
He's entertaining.
He's got a good sense of humor,

1:03:08.367 --> 1:03:12.413
but he's also very devious. He's very--
And he's a mean son of a gun.

1:03:12.497 --> 1:03:15.666
The man's a wimp.
I mean, people that sneak up on women

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:18.544
and kill them and-- What else can you say?

1:03:19.504 --> 1:03:21.088
[Hagmaier] At some point that day,

1:03:21.172 --> 1:03:23.925
Ted tells me
that he's not gonna sit in the chair.

1:03:26.135 --> 1:03:29.263
And I-- I said,
"Well, what-- what are you gonna do?"

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:31.641
He said, "I'm gonna die right here."

1:03:32.099 --> 1:03:34.018
And he was sitting across from me,

1:03:34.894 --> 1:03:36.729
and he had a pen.

1:03:37.188 --> 1:03:41.400
And he said, "I can stick this so far
up my artery, it'll squirt in your face.

1:03:41.901 --> 1:03:44.195
And I'll be drained
before anybody even gets here."

1:03:44.987 --> 1:03:47.198
And I said, "Is that what you want to do?"

1:03:47.281 --> 1:03:51.244
And he says,
"I'm not going to let them kill me."

1:03:52.078 --> 1:03:54.080
And we had just had
some other discussions,

1:03:54.163 --> 1:03:57.708
religious discussions
throughout our visits over the years.

1:03:57.792 --> 1:04:00.586
But that particular day,
he had the Bible with him,

1:04:00.670 --> 1:04:02.129
and he was reading scripture.

1:04:03.047 --> 1:04:03.881
And I said...

1:04:05.049 --> 1:04:07.260
"How many numbers
did we talk about earlier?"

1:04:07.802 --> 1:04:10.054
And he said, "Thirty-something."
And I said...

1:04:10.930 --> 1:04:12.682
"And now, you're gonna go to 31?

1:04:13.266 --> 1:04:15.977
Don't you think taking a life,
even if it's your own,

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:18.771
is a method of homicide,
even though they call it suicide?

1:04:19.313 --> 1:04:22.400
If you think there's a deity upstairs
that's gonna judge you,

1:04:22.483 --> 1:04:25.486
do you think you're in a position
to push the envelope that far?"

1:04:26.112 --> 1:04:27.780
And he just looked at me and said...

1:04:29.115 --> 1:04:30.157
"You got me again."

1:04:31.534 --> 1:04:33.870
And so, then, he prayed some, and I...

1:04:34.453 --> 1:04:35.413
prayed with him.

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:39.917
-All right, can you all hear?
-[woman] Yeah.

1:04:40.001 --> 1:04:43.004
Ted Bundy is being served
for supper tonight

1:04:43.087 --> 1:04:45.798
a meal of burrito, rice, and salad.

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:47.466
At five o'clock tomorrow morning,

1:04:47.550 --> 1:04:50.845
he'll be offered a last meal
of traditional steak and eggs.

1:04:51.721 --> 1:04:56.017
Then we rehearsed his execution
on a chair in the office.

1:04:56.684 --> 1:04:59.061
I said, "Well, you know,
they're gonna shave your head.

1:04:59.145 --> 1:05:00.897
They're gonna shave your right calf."

1:05:01.355 --> 1:05:03.858
I said,
"You're going to sit down in the chair."

1:05:03.941 --> 1:05:05.526
I said,
"They're gonna put shackles on your feet.

1:05:05.610 --> 1:05:07.486
You know, you're gonna feel jilts."

1:05:09.155 --> 1:05:11.908
This evening,
there is a one-on-one interview

1:05:11.991 --> 1:05:14.577
with Dr. James Dobson,
which you are aware of.

1:05:15.161 --> 1:05:17.914
[male reporter] Bundy told
a California religious broadcaster

1:05:17.997 --> 1:05:22.043
that a sexual frenzy drove him
to kill women across the country.

1:05:22.418 --> 1:05:25.379
There was a great deal of remorse said.

1:05:25.463 --> 1:05:28.424
He wept several times...

1:05:28.507 --> 1:05:30.718
while talking to me.

1:05:31.427 --> 1:05:33.512
I've lived in prison for a long time, now.

1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:37.642
And, I've met a lot of men

1:05:37.725 --> 1:05:40.269
who were motivated
to commit violence, just like me.

1:05:40.853 --> 1:05:42.730
And without exception,

1:05:43.230 --> 1:05:47.276
every one of them
was deeply involved in pornography.

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:49.779
without question, without exception.

1:05:49.862 --> 1:05:53.616
Deeply influenced and consumed
by an addiction to pornography.

1:05:55.201 --> 1:05:58.287
[Aynesworth] I was stunned
when he blamed it on pornography,

1:05:58.371 --> 1:06:03.209
because we all grow up
having access to pornography,

1:06:03.292 --> 1:06:07.088
and it doesn't turn us all
into serial killers.

1:06:07.672 --> 1:06:10.883
I guess he was trying to blame it
on somebody else. [chuckles]

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:14.178
You know, blame it
on the devil and pornography.

1:06:14.261 --> 1:06:17.390
I think that's typical Ted.
He's playing it for all it's worth.

1:06:17.473 --> 1:06:19.433
He's playing a game. He's buying time.

1:06:20.476 --> 1:06:22.520
In truth, when I talked to him
about the pornography,

1:06:22.603 --> 1:06:25.356
he said, "I never said it made me do it.

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:28.192
But I did as best I could
to try to get them to help me.

1:06:28.275 --> 1:06:31.737
You know it didn't make me do it.
I did it because I wanted to do it."

1:06:38.661 --> 1:06:39.578
[female reporter] Good morning.

1:06:39.662 --> 1:06:42.790
In just about ten minutes,
serial killer Ted Bundy

1:06:42.873 --> 1:06:45.710
is scheduled to be executed here,
at Florida State Prison.

1:06:46.377 --> 1:06:47.586
[male reporter] The prison fired up

1:06:47.670 --> 1:06:49.880
the generators which power
the electric chair.

1:06:49.964 --> 1:06:52.425
Neither the Supreme Court
or Governor's Office

1:06:52.508 --> 1:06:53.884
has granted a stay.

1:06:54.552 --> 1:06:56.303
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

[Michaud] I was in New York.

1:07:05.771 --> 1:07:08.315
I got up early to watch it on TV.

1:07:08.399 --> 1:07:10.735

Floodlights bathe the prison at dawn.

1:07:10.818 --> 1:07:14.488
Note the activity visible in the window
at the bottom right of your screen

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:16.866
as the death chamber is being prepared.

1:07:18.325 --> 1:07:22.997
I was interested that there were
a lot of drunken college kids there.

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:27.001
Uh, young men who were age ten or so

1:07:27.084 --> 1:07:29.962
when Ted had killed those girls
at Chi Omega.

1:07:30.629 --> 1:07:33.090
It was an excuse to get drunk
and hoop it up.

1:07:33.549 --> 1:07:35.259
There was a lot of that going on.

1:07:35.968 --> 1:07:37.011

[Dekle] All of the witnesses,
the official witnesses

1:07:58.657 --> 1:08:00.242
we got there early in the morning.

1:08:00.868 --> 1:08:02.620
Loaded us up in buses...

1:08:04.121 --> 1:08:06.791
and then drove us over
to the death chamber.

1:08:08.834 --> 1:08:11.879
We walked into the viewing part
of the death chamber.

1:08:13.297 --> 1:08:15.257
And doors swung open,

1:08:15.341 --> 1:08:19.053
in came two burly guards
with Bundy between them.

1:08:19.136 --> 1:08:21.680
And he was white as a sheet.

1:08:23.474 --> 1:08:25.976
They brought him around
to the electric chair.

1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:27.770
and they strapped him down,

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:30.314
and he was allowed
to say some final words.

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:33.776
He said something about
sorry he caused so much trouble.

1:08:35.361 --> 1:08:39.949
Then they lower the skull cap
with the black hood over his head.

1:08:41.784 --> 1:08:44.495
A guy on the phone gives a high sign,

1:08:44.829 --> 1:08:46.205
and they throw the switch.

1:08:46.622 --> 1:08:47.665
[click]

1:08:51.627 --> 1:08:55.131
And as the electricity coursed
through his body,

1:08:55.548 --> 1:08:57.258
you could see his fist tightening...

1:08:58.134 --> 1:09:00.427
with the thumb between the two fingers.

1:09:01.095 --> 1:09:04.265
And I remember thinking that time,
"I wonder how many throats...

1:09:05.724 --> 1:09:07.810
that fist has tightened around."

1:09:11.105 --> 1:09:13.023
When the electricity was turned off,

1:09:13.732 --> 1:09:15.734
a doctor unbuttoned
the front of his shirt,

1:09:15.818 --> 1:09:17.486
put a stethoscope to his chest,

1:09:17.570 --> 1:09:21.031
and finally stepped back
and pronounced Bundy dead.

1:09:22.032 --> 1:09:23.826
And then I think it was a warden,

1:09:23.909 --> 1:09:27.413
someone announced that the death penalty
had been carried out.

1:09:29.039 --> 1:09:31.584
I'm ashamed to admit that I was elated.

1:09:32.501 --> 1:09:34.503
I hope I'm never that happy...

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:37.256
over the death
of another human being ever again.

1:09:41.218 --> 1:09:44.471
[reporter] His witnesses walked out
of the prison to signal Bundy's death.

1:09:44.555 --> 1:09:45.890
The crowd outside cheered.

1:09:46.557 --> 1:09:48.392

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:52.021
About damn time!

1:10:01.572 --> 1:10:05.451
[Hagmaier] Then the hearse
picked him up and drove down, and...

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:09.330
hundreds and hundreds of people
ran after the hearse.

1:10:09.413 --> 1:10:11.248
[cheering]

1:10:12.917 --> 1:10:14.919
[male reporter] For the man
who murdered dozens of women,

1:10:15.419 --> 1:10:17.504
the irony of the final act of justice

1:10:17.588 --> 1:10:20.841
is that it may have been carried out
by a female executioner,

1:10:20.925 --> 1:10:23.719
hidden from Bundy and others
by a black hood.

1:10:32.102 --> 1:10:34.480
[Hagmaier]
He decided that he would be cremated.

1:10:34.563 --> 1:10:37.983
And he wanted his remains
spread over the Cascade Mountains,

1:10:39.944 --> 1:10:42.488
where he said he had
some of the best times of his life.

1:10:42.988 --> 1:10:44.657
But of course,
that's also where the remains

1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:46.533
of some of his victims were found.

1:10:47.201 --> 1:10:49.370
And some probably still remain there.

1:10:54.124 --> 1:10:56.043
[Nelson] Did anyone know the real Ted?

1:10:56.669 --> 1:11:01.966
Was he just an evil genius,
as the Ted Bundy myth eventually became?

1:11:03.300 --> 1:11:04.885
Or was there something wrong?

1:11:05.344 --> 1:11:07.513
Was he not in complete control?

1:11:09.556 --> 1:11:12.726
[Sandi Holt] He could have done
something good with this life.

1:11:13.852 --> 1:11:14.853
But he didn't.

1:11:15.562 --> 1:11:17.273
He chose to go his way.

1:11:19.692 --> 1:11:21.777
[Bruce Lubeck]
There's never been anybody I've seen

1:11:21.860 --> 1:11:25.239
that remotely approaches what he was like.

1:11:26.323 --> 1:11:30.911
There were just too many things wrong,
too many wires crossed.

1:11:30.995 --> 1:11:33.080
He was born with the safety off.

1:11:35.457 --> 1:11:37.376
[Marlin Lee Vortman]
How do I feel about Ted?

1:11:37.835 --> 1:11:40.963
I don't think I really, really handled it.

1:11:42.006 --> 1:11:43.841
You know, he's-- he's gone.

1:11:44.675 --> 1:11:46.135
I don't deal with it.

1:11:46.969 --> 1:11:50.764
I sort of closed that chapter
a long time ago in my life.

1:11:53.350 --> 1:11:56.478
[Carol DaRonch]
I was very lucky I got away

1:11:56.562 --> 1:11:59.440
from one of the world's
most infamous serial killers.

1:12:00.107 --> 1:12:02.985
I sit and think
about the victims and their families.

1:12:04.278 --> 1:12:06.488
He did not deserve to live.

1:12:08.532 --> 1:12:11.744
He's in a place, where I hope...

1:12:12.077 --> 1:12:14.538
that he's basically just burning in hell.

1:12:17.916 --> 1:12:21.545
[Michaud] Ted endures in the hearts
and minds of those who knew him.

1:12:22.129 --> 1:12:24.965
Like a bad cold,
he just keeps coming back.

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:28.635
There's a kind of a taint
that I can't get rid of.

1:12:29.636 --> 1:12:31.138
[Aynesworth] It was horrendous.

1:12:32.890 --> 1:12:35.768
Sometimes you wake up at night
and think about it. [chuckles]

1:12:42.107 --> 1:12:46.987
[Bundy] We want to be able to say
we can identify these dangerous people.

1:12:47.863 --> 1:12:50.449
And the really scary thing is
you can't identify them.

1:12:51.325 --> 1:12:55.120
People don't realize that there are
potential killers among them.

1:12:57.539 --> 1:13:00.584
How could anyone live
in a society where...

1:13:01.168 --> 1:13:05.714
people they liked, loved, lived with,
worked with, and admired

1:13:06.131 --> 1:13:08.133
could the next day turn out to be

1:13:09.051 --> 1:13:11.512
the most demonic people imaginable?
