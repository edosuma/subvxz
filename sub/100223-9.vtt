14:41.256 --> 14:42.633
‐ Sir, please.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.552
‐ I'll call my supervisor.
‐ No time. We are looking at rapid onset.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.513
Everybody in this building
needs to lock their doors

14:47.513 --> 14:49.431
and stay there
until otherwise notified.

14:49.431 --> 14:52.142
‐ Let's lock it down!
‐ And all guests must shelter in place.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.602
‐ Shelter.
‐ That's right.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.479
‐ I don't think I can help you guys
with that right now.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.688
‐ Oh, no. Oh, dear.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.106
STACEY: Uh‐oh. Yeah.
DALE: Look at his eyes.

14:58.106 --> 15:01.109
You see all the jaundice?
I think you're gonna need to sit down.

DALE: Sit down, sir.
Now, I have a question for you.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.574
Have you taken a look
at your stool of late?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.076
‐ This is not a drill.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.078
DALE: Any combination of brownish,
yellowish, grayish, blackish?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.663
GEOFFREY:
Leslie, how you doing? You in place?

15:12.663 --> 15:14.790

GEOFFREY: <i>Okay.</i>

15:28.136 --> 15:29.179
Getting close.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.348
VICTOR: You two proceed
to the north end, I'll take the south.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.935
I should be able to pinpoint Molly's exact
location and let you know when it's safe.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.019
I'll give you the signal.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.022
‐ I'll take control of the elevators.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.899
They'll be out of commission
until we're done.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.028
‐ Tina, I'm sorry about
what happened to Robert.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.031
Wish I... I could have done something.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.075
‐ Me too.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.536
But I'll make that bitch pay.

15:52.536 --> 15:55.038
First, let's save Molly.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.669
MORGAN:
It's time.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.548
‐ You're supposed to close your eyes.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.134
‐ You only know my eyes are open
because <i>your</i> eyes are open.

16:43.754 --> 16:44.755

take the girl?

18:38.076 --> 18:41.747

Yeah, I hope that's okay.

19:25.791 --> 19:29.169

to our not‐so‐secret hideout.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.797

‐ Okay, let me just...

19:31.797 --> 19:35.008
Was everybody invited to
the housewarming party but old Dale?

19:35.008 --> 19:36.635
‐ I wouldn't classify it as a party.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.470
‐ Uh‐huh. Okay.

19:39.304 --> 19:43.016
I will say, as far as secret lairs go,
it's pretty sweet.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.977
‐ Um, what the hell
are you all doing here?

19:44.977 --> 19:48.772
‐ Geoffrey broke free of Morgan's spell
and told us that she had Molly.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.065
‐ So we went and got her out.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.484
‐ But, Molly, you called us.
You said that you were fine.

19:52.484 --> 19:55.028
‐ I had some kind of spell on me.
It was really weird.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.406
It was like I was watching
myself lie, but I...

19:57.406 --> 19:59.157
I couldn't control my words and I...

19:59.157 --> 20:00.909
I'm, I'm sorry. I...

20:03.537 --> 20:05.664
‐ I'm afraid that's the least of it.

20:06.832 --> 20:10.085
I saw the sigils Morgan used
in the ceremony.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.379
I heard enough of her spell.

20:12.963 --> 20:14.506
She's not just doing dark magic.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.510
She's bringing the dark realm
crashing into this one.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.929
‐ [thunder crashes]
‐ The poppies and the storm...

20:22.347 --> 20:23.724
It's already started.

20:24.183 --> 20:26.810
‐ Believe me when I tell you
we cannot let that happen.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.396
GEOFFREY: My God, Alex.
‐ We're gonna need a plan.

20:31.899 --> 20:35.903
Those of us who've been to the other side
know how bad it'll be if Morgan succeeds.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.905
So we gotta take
the fight to her. Tonight.

20:37.905 --> 20:40.032
‐ How? We've seen what the Whispers
from the phones can do.

20:40.032 --> 20:43.493
‐ And what's to stop Morgan from turning
all of us into mindless killer drones?

20:43.493 --> 20:46.038
‐ Then, not to pile on the bad news,
but even if we do manage

20:46.038 --> 20:49.124
to stay unenchanted ourselves,
Morgan still has an entire army.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.375
LESLIE:
And an army that's growing.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.669
Those phones have been distributed
up the entire coast.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.379
‐ So we're talking hundreds
of thousands of users

20:54.379 --> 20:55.672
‐ More like millions.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.341
‐ What's this army for, anyway?

20:57.341 --> 20:59.468
‐ In Morgan's case, I don't think
preserving national security

20:59.468 --> 21:01.094
and defending the Constitution.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.679
KAROLINA:
Maybe it's like a new Church.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.389
A leader isn't a leader
without any followers.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.684
‐ Every good dictator‐‐
and by good I mean bad‐‐

21:07.684 --> 21:10.062
needs a loyal army to maintain power.

21:10.062 --> 21:11.396
‐ And to draw power from.

21:11.396 --> 21:14.107
Maybe Morgan is using those followers
like she used Molly,

21:14.107 --> 21:16.068
to amplify her magic
and tear down the veil.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.694
‐ Can't we just take down
the phone somehow?

21:17.694 --> 21:19.613
I mean, calls drop all the time in L. A.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.406
‐ These phones are powered
by Morgan's magic.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.742
‐ The cell towers still use
good old‐fashioned tech.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.702
‐ Meaning they can be hacked.
VICTOR: It would take some work,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.204
but if you and Chase and I
put our heads together,

21:27.204 --> 21:28.622
we could see what we come up with.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.332
‐ I've got some ideas.
NICO: Okay, great,

21:30.332 --> 21:32.459
but that doesn't
solve our biggest problem.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.837
Morgan. She can't be defeated
by technology.

21:34.837 --> 21:36.505
That's why we need this.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.674
A weapon forged in Morgan's world

21:38.674 --> 21:40.592
through a combination
of light and dark energy.

21:40.592 --> 21:43.637
‐ But the only way to defeat her with that
is by sticking it in her.

21:43.637 --> 21:45.848
‐ And that sounds like a direct
physical confrontation.

21:45.848 --> 21:46.932
‐ If that's what it takes.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.518
‐ We can't be reckless.
Morgan's magic is too strong.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.564
But... there may be a way to contain it.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.899
With a circle of salt.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.194
‐ Like a Wiccan magic circle.

21:59.194 --> 22:03.532
It's used to create a sacred space,
a barrier to limit spells.

22:03.532 --> 22:06.118
‐ Seriously? Like table salt?

22:06.869 --> 22:08.495
It's really that simple?

22:08.495 --> 22:09.663
‐ It's not simple at all.

22:09.663 --> 22:12.457
It needs to be imbued with magic,
forged with blood.

22:12.457 --> 22:15.252
‐ Okay, I... that sounds terrifying.

22:15.252 --> 22:17.212
‐ Whatever it takes, let's get it done.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.840
Okay, we figure out a way to draw Morgan
out close enough to spike her.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.967
‐ While disabling her army
of human batteries.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.052
‐ All in a day's work.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.767
‐ Hey, Stacey.
Can you hold on a second?

22:30.767 --> 22:32.227
I think I need your help.

like a damn ragdoll.

22:41.737 --> 22:43.572
Forgot how strong your little girl is.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.867
‐ There is something still left in there.
You need a hospital.

22:46.867 --> 22:49.077
‐ No. It's too dangerous.

22:50.120 --> 22:55.125
I just need a couple of cold towels,
mouthwash, and Mr. Clean.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.545
Nana B always loves a good home remedy.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.255

ALEX: Everything's in the bathroom.

23:02.633 --> 23:03.842
‐ I'll be right back.

23:08.722 --> 23:09.723
[Geoffrey groans]

23:13.393 --> 23:15.062
‐ Missed you at your mother's funeral.

23:15.771 --> 23:18.815
‐ Sorry. I was possessed
by a psychotic Gibb,

23:18.815 --> 23:20.359
then thrown into another dimension.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.277
‐ Alex, listen to me.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.072
I hate everything that's happened to you.

23:25.072 --> 23:27.115
‐ You don't know what happened to me.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.283
‐ Then tell me, son.

23:30.369 --> 23:31.620
‐ No one can help me.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.122
‐ So you're a...
you're a hard man now, right?

23:35.040 --> 23:37.876
Willing to win, whatever it takes?
That's what you said, right?

23:37.876 --> 23:39.086
‐ Everyone's afraid.

23:40.170 --> 23:43.215
They're always second guessing,
debating shit endlessly.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.550
This is about survival.

23:46.009 --> 23:49.221
So, yes, I'm not gonna apologize
for wanting to live.

23:54.977 --> 23:56.478
[distant thunder crashing]

24:01.775 --> 24:02.776
MOLLY:
Is he okay?

24:03.610 --> 24:04.903
‐ I hope so.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.323
It's good to have you back, Molls.

24:08.991 --> 24:12.703
Sorry that we left.
Didn't mean to.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.288
‐ It's okay.

24:14.288 --> 24:17.291
Also I'm sorry
that I lied to you on the phone call.

24:17.291 --> 24:19.459
I think that really hurt Mr. Wilder.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.961
‐ That's not your fault.

24:21.753 --> 24:22.796
He's tough.

24:23.589 --> 24:27.718
Never in all those years did I think
this would be our lives.

24:27.718 --> 24:32.389
Holed up in an underground mansion,
pulling an all‐nighter

24:32.389 --> 24:36.518
to save the world with our parents.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.687
‐ Yeah, but... that's life, right?

24:40.772 --> 24:42.608
‐ I kind of wish that wasn't the case.

24:43.942 --> 24:48.071
I wish that you'd go back to Atlas

24:48.071 --> 24:49.615
and finish school,

24:49.615 --> 24:51.617
maybe meet me in college.

24:52.242 --> 24:56.246
‐ Yeah. You might want
that old life back, but I don't.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.957
I'm not the same as I used to be.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.293
[laughs] You know what? This proves it.

25:02.002 --> 25:04.671
I got this when the lightning hit me.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.841
‐ Lightning? Damn, Molly.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.511
‐ No, it's okay, I'm fine, really.

25:10.719 --> 25:11.803
That's my point.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.640
Morgan didn't choose me
because I'm the weakest.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.058
It's because I'm strong.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.185
We're superheroes, Gert.

25:18.769 --> 25:21.313
And I think that means
we have to do something with it.

25:21.855 --> 25:24.608
‐ What if you get hurt? Or worse?

25:24.942 --> 25:26.693
‐ Then I'll just get back up...

25:27.819 --> 25:29.905
as many times as I can.

25:34.618 --> 25:36.245
[footsteps approaching]

25:40.499 --> 25:41.750
‐ Hey, Mom.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.421
‐ You were worried about Nico
and her connection with Morgan.

25:48.382 --> 25:50.384
‐ It's not just Morgan, it's...

25:50.843 --> 25:52.261
it's the magic.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.472
Everything that comes with it.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.853
The more powers grow, the...

26:04.022 --> 26:06.316
the more I feel like maybe
we're on different paths.

26:10.153 --> 26:13.407
‐ I know what it's like
to love someone so much

26:13.407 --> 26:15.492
you lose yourself completely.

26:16.577 --> 26:19.162
And believe me, it's never a good thing.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.165
‐ Oh... apologies.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.293
I didn't mean to interrupt
a tender moment

26:24.293 --> 26:26.003
between <i>la madre y la hijita.</i>

26:26.378 --> 26:29.673
‐ But now that you have...
‐ Yes. Question.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.508
Could be important, might not be quick.

26:32.593 --> 26:34.970
Now, I've never heard the Whispers myself,
but I was wondering,

26:34.970 --> 26:37.306
what's the neuro process
that takes someone from a state

26:37.306 --> 26:40.642
of passive listening to active
somnambulation and suggestibility?

26:40.642 --> 26:42.853
There are drugs that do that
"Manchurian Candidate"<i>‐</i> style

26:42.853 --> 26:45.397
but to do it purely with sound...

26:45.772 --> 26:48.275
‐ Uh... I don't... I don't know.

26:48.275 --> 26:51.236
I wish I could help you,
but I couldn't even hear the voices.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.113
‐ What do you mean, couldn't?

26:53.113 --> 26:56.867
‐ Well, when Molly got infected,
Gert and Chase could hear the voices,

26:56.867 --> 26:58.035
but I didn't hear anything.

27:00.454 --> 27:02.331
‐ It's asparagus anosmia.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.208
‐ Excuse me?

27:05.292 --> 27:07.961
‐ You know how eating asparagus
makes your urine kind of...

27:07.961 --> 27:10.172
‐ Stink? Yeah, everybody knows that.
DALE: Not everyone.

27:10.172 --> 27:11.673
Some people have a genetic anomaly

27:11.673 --> 27:13.759
that makes it impossible
for them to smell it.

27:13.759 --> 27:16.803
‐ So, what you're saying is
that because of my genetics,

27:16.803 --> 27:18.388
I can't hear the Whispers?

27:18.388 --> 27:19.640
DALE:
Yes. Maybe.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.475
Your alien genetics.

27:21.475 --> 27:24.645
See, when we were trying to best Jonah,
I made serum based on his DNA.

27:24.645 --> 27:27.105
‐ So Karolina's might counteract
the Whispers.

27:27.105 --> 27:29.525
‐ Maybe. Magic is just science
we don't understand.

27:30.108 --> 27:31.527
The antibodies in your blood

27:31.527 --> 27:33.987
might just protecteveryone
from the freaky mind control,

27:33.987 --> 27:36.740
but I would need equipment:
sterilizing agents, syringes.

27:36.740 --> 27:39.409
‐ We have a full disaster
and first‐aid kit in the Church van.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.995
‐ [snaps fingers]
‐ Boom. That might get us halfway there.

27:42.579 --> 27:44.039
You know, if I could pull this off,

27:44.039 --> 27:46.124
booyakasha!
<i>Enchantamente no más.</i>

27:46.124 --> 27:47.709
Come on, up top.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.629
K‐dawg, I hope you're not
afraid of needles. Whoo!

27:51.129 --> 27:53.507
‐ I've got boosters
tapped into the observatory.

27:53.507 --> 27:57.219
Wilder's setup was fine,
but we're gonna need a lot more juice.

27:57.219 --> 28:01.014
‐ You jacked their power grid.
That's pretty damn smart, Chase.

28:01.014 --> 28:03.684
‐ Well, I am your son.

28:03.684 --> 28:05.727
‐ [scoffs] Not just <i>my</i> son.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.856
There's someone I wanna show you.

28:12.317 --> 28:13.569
<i>‐ Hello, Chase.</i>

28:15.153 --> 28:16.655
‐ Hey, um...

28:18.031 --> 28:20.075
I knew I'd see you again.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.328
How are you?

28:23.328 --> 28:27.833
<i>‐ Well, besides not being able</i>
<i>to hug you both right now, I'm...</i>

28:28.834 --> 28:31.170
<i>I'm the best I've been in my whole life.</i>

28:34.173 --> 28:35.799
<i>But whaddya say we get to work?</i>

28:35.799 --> 28:37.885
‐ Okay, Jaybrid. Show me what you got.

28:37.885 --> 28:41.930
<i>‐ Okay, this is every cell phone tower</i>
<i>being used in the state.</i>

28:41.930 --> 28:44.766
<i>The way people value</i>
<i>their cell phone bars these days,</i>

28:44.766 --> 28:48.353
<i>this security system is‐‐</i>
<i>it's like a fortress with no door.</i>

28:48.353 --> 28:52.149
‐ Okay, so now we see
if we can tunnel in.

28:54.651 --> 28:55.861
[sighs, keying]

29:02.868 --> 29:05.704
‐ Okay, you gave me such shit
about being wicked...

29:05.704 --> 29:08.957
and here you are doing
blood magic again.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.336
Mom? Are you okay?

29:12.336 --> 29:14.505
‐ I put more than my blood into this salt.

29:15.214 --> 29:16.465
[sighs]

29:20.093 --> 29:23.263
It will cost me a number
of years of my life.

29:23.263 --> 29:24.723
‐ Mom.
‐ Nico‐‐

29:24.723 --> 29:27.768
When a parent says they would give
their life to protect their children,

29:27.768 --> 29:29.520
they mean it.

29:33.899 --> 29:36.401
‐ You really think it'll work?
‐ I don't know.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.570
Never done this before.

29:40.197 --> 29:42.074
Once the flame is out, it'll be ready.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.919
You crossed over to get Alex. How?

29:54.294 --> 29:56.630
Your father failed to get the Darkhold.

29:56.630 --> 29:58.382
‐ No, he didn't.

29:59.091 --> 30:01.552
‐ WizGlasses. He recorded it?

30:03.595 --> 30:06.181
Robert. You brilliant man.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.808
‐ We got there another way.

30:08.517 --> 30:10.227
I couldn't make the spell work.

30:10.227 --> 30:12.187
‐ But if we can figure it out together,

30:12.187 --> 30:15.399
we might be able to send Morgan back
where she belongs.

30:16.233 --> 30:17.609
‐ [thunder crashing]
‐ [distant shrieking]

30:18.360 --> 30:20.195
‐ The mirror. That's how Morgan
communicated to me

30:20.195 --> 30:21.488
from the Dark Dimension.

30:23.323 --> 30:26.702
[mirror crackling]

30:26.702 --> 30:28.328
[distant shrieking]

30:28.328 --> 30:32.332
‐ That's Morgan's Dark Army.
They're gonna cross over.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.835
[voices shrieking]

30:39.173 --> 30:40.883
[beeping]

30:42.718 --> 30:43.886
‐ That's good.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.275
[crowd murmuring]

31:02.905 --> 31:04.156
‐ Thank you.

31:17.503 --> 31:19.087
[thunder crashing]

31:24.885 --> 31:26.595
[witches chanting softly]

31:54.122 --> 31:56.375
[muffled snarling]

32:08.345 --> 32:10.013
NICO:
How is this happening?

32:10.013 --> 32:12.391
I thought Morgan needed the Staff
to merge the worlds.

32:12.391 --> 32:14.434
‐ No. But once the worlds become one,
she will need it

32:14.434 --> 32:15.936
to rule and maintain power.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.607
Years ago, when I was training
in the ways of magic,

32:20.607 --> 32:22.818
Morgan... befriended me.

32:22.818 --> 32:24.695
‐ Wait, you two were friends?

32:24.695 --> 32:27.739
‐ I wasn't aware of it at the time,
but she was manipulating me.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.157
From the Dark Dimension.

32:29.157 --> 32:30.701
‐ The same way she came for me.

32:32.536 --> 32:34.162
‐ The Staff of One had
made its way to the vaults

32:34.162 --> 32:35.914
of our academy for safekeeping.

32:36.915 --> 32:38.458
She considered it her birthright.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.752
Morgan convinced me to steal it.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.963
Once I realized what she was doing...

32:43.463 --> 32:44.840
‐ You kept it for yourself.

32:44.840 --> 32:48.635
‐ I knew I needed to keep it
out of Morgan's hands.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.637
Yes, I wanted it.

32:50.929 --> 32:53.182
I'm so sorry, Nico.
‐ [army shrieking]

32:53.182 --> 32:55.976
But Morgan will never stop
coming for the Staff.

32:55.976 --> 32:57.728
‐ I'll be ready when she does.

32:57.728 --> 33:00.105
[snarling]

33:01.106 --> 33:02.900
How do we hold off the Dark Army?

33:02.900 --> 33:06.653
‐ I can try a spell, but once I begin,
I will need to maintain it.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.323
You'll be on your own.

33:11.992 --> 33:12.993
Do it.

33:18.373 --> 33:21.043
Hey. It's happening faster
than we thought.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.753
The Dark Dimension is gonna
break through soon.

33:23.837 --> 33:25.130
‐ Then we have to get to Morgan now.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.258
‐ No. Morgan's gonna come to us.
Before the breach, she'll want the Staff.

33:28.258 --> 33:29.760
‐ Morgan's coming here?
‐ Yes.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.136
I can feel it.

33:31.136 --> 33:32.471
[distant thunder rumbling]

33:36.391 --> 33:37.976
‐ Then we'll have home court advantage.

33:37.976 --> 33:40.187
We just gotta be ready
and hope the plan works.

33:40.187 --> 33:44.483
‐ Okay. But this time, we stick together.
No matter what.

33:44.858 --> 33:47.653
GEOFFREY:
Ah, shit! Oww!

33:47.653 --> 33:50.739
‐ How's your dad?
‐ He's hurt, but he'll live.

33:51.031 --> 33:52.824
‐ You are gonna die, Geoffrey.

33:52.824 --> 33:54.409
‐ [gasping] I've had worse.

33:55.035 --> 33:56.912
‐ You have a fragment of metal
in your body.

33:56.912 --> 34:00.123
If we leave this in any longer,
it's going to poison your blood.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.458
Surgery's your only option.

34:01.458 --> 34:02.584
‐ You're the only doctor?

34:02.584 --> 34:04.837
‐ Yeah. The only one you've got right now.

34:04.837 --> 34:05.963
[Geoffrey sighs]

34:05.963 --> 34:09.174
‐ Okay. Dale raided the first‐aid kit
for his experiment,

34:09.174 --> 34:10.676
but I think we should have what we need.

34:11.677 --> 34:14.137
‐ How about whiskey?
Got any of that in there?

34:15.097 --> 34:16.598
It's another one of Nana B's
home remedies.

34:16.598 --> 34:18.517
‐ Okay, okay, okay.

34:21.144 --> 34:25.023
‐ I can't believe you made a centrifuge
out of Chase's protein shake blender.

34:25.023 --> 34:29.736
‐ Well, sometimes you girls forget
your dad is a bioengineering genius.

34:29.736 --> 34:32.906
Now, Gert, please, you don't have to say‐‐
don't say anything, okay?

34:32.906 --> 34:35.993
I know that I make it easy,
most of the time,

34:35.993 --> 34:38.704
for you to forget the genius part.

34:39.246 --> 34:42.165
‐ Actually, I was gonna say, this is...

34:42.875 --> 34:44.835
this is really bad‐ass.

34:50.257 --> 34:52.801
‐ Okay, sweetheart, you ready?

34:52.801 --> 34:54.928
Here goes.
‐ [thunder crashing]

34:54.928 --> 34:56.388
Please, please, please.

34:56.388 --> 34:59.558
Now... it may sting just a little bit,

34:59.558 --> 35:03.687
and you're going to feel
a slight sense of euphoria,

35:03.687 --> 35:06.523
as well as a few other side effects:
dizziness, upset stomach,

35:06.523 --> 35:09.151
swelling of the extremities,
also known as "sausage fingers."

35:10.986 --> 35:12.738
‐ Wait, sausage fingers?

35:12.738 --> 35:15.490
Why didn't you tell me that
before you injected me?

35:15.490 --> 35:18.493
‐ Okay, Gert, you are up.
GERT: Wait.

35:19.036 --> 35:20.996
Is this gonna affect
my connection with Old Lace?

35:20.996 --> 35:23.582
‐ Well, we are altering your DNA,

35:23.582 --> 35:25.918
so yes, your psychic link
could be disrupted.

35:25.918 --> 35:28.337
‐ Okay, disrupted but not destroyed?
‐ I...

35:28.337 --> 35:31.006
‐ So it could come back
when the serum wears off.

35:31.006 --> 35:34.426
‐ I'm not...
Sweetie, I'm not sure of anything.

35:35.344 --> 35:36.887
‐ Wait. Old Lace.

35:36.887 --> 35:38.138
[Old Lace growls]

[groaning]

35:44.853 --> 35:45.854
Hey.

35:47.231 --> 35:49.066
You know I don't wanna do this, right?

35:49.066 --> 35:50.651
[Old Lace groans]

35:50.651 --> 35:53.195
[laughs] You know it's just...

35:53.195 --> 35:56.031
It's just, I can't have some crazy witch
getting in my head

35:56.031 --> 35:58.575
and then making you do something terrible.

35:59.368 --> 36:00.911
So please don't be mad.

36:00.911 --> 36:04.623
It's just that...
if we lose our connection...

36:05.415 --> 36:08.001
you're probably gonna be
a really grumpy dinosaur.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.503
[Old Lace groans]

36:09.837 --> 36:12.422
You're probably gonna wanna eat someone.

36:15.217 --> 36:16.176
So...

36:17.553 --> 36:19.179
we have to lock you away.

36:19.638 --> 36:21.098
[Old Lace groans]

36:21.557 --> 36:25.143
Hey, it's okay. But I promise
I will come back for you

36:25.143 --> 36:26.854
as soon as I can, okay?

36:27.646 --> 36:29.022
[Old Lace groans]

Come on, please?

36:31.567 --> 36:33.402

‐ Why can't we keep
the individual cell towers down longer?

36:49.001 --> 36:51.545
‐ [sighs] The network has
significant safety protocols.

36:51.545 --> 36:52.921
We can't seem to override them.

36:52.921 --> 36:55.132

36:55.132 --> 36:57.342

that was confiscated by the FBI?

37:05.184 --> 37:06.351
[clears throat]

37:06.351 --> 37:09.104

a rebellious streak in our youth.

All great inventors do.
<i>‐ Victor, maybe that's it.</i>

37:11.940 --> 37:15.944
<i>The Disruptor used the network's</i>
<i>safety protocol against itself.</i>

37:15.944 --> 37:18.071
‐ So instead of sneaking in the back door,

37:18.071 --> 37:20.574
we actually have to convince
the network it's under attack.

37:20.574 --> 37:21.909
<i>‐ Exactly.</i>

the Staff is yours.

42:17.538 --> 42:21.583
The trouble is, you still fear
the power it possesses,

42:21.583 --> 42:24.211
and fear is weakness.

42:24.211 --> 42:29.216
It was that fear that had me betrayed
