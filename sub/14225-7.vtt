00:08.800 --> 00:10.636
- It's so hot, - I feel like
- I'm in an oven...

00:10.639 --> 00:13.513
On the sun, in summer.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.078
I'm sweating so much,

00:15.079 --> 00:16.642
my belly button could be

00:13.514 --> 00:16.642
a hot tub for a gnat.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.894
Okay.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.772
- Guess, it's just
- you and me, Hazel.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.984
Oh, poor Hazel.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.612
- No one wants to play
- badminton with her.

00:28.615 --> 00:29.989
That's because she has

00:29.990 --> 00:31.365
the personality of a sunburn.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.578
- You should see her
- play soccer by herself.

00:36.581 --> 00:38.080
It is exhausting.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.501
I feel bad for her.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.045
- Maybe I should try
- to be her friend.

00:45.048 --> 00:46.339
What? She shot

00:46.340 --> 00:47.630
an arrow at you,

00:47.631 --> 00:49.217
knocked you into mud,

00:49.218 --> 00:50.801
filled your pillow

00:47.631 --> 00:50.800
with fire ants.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.949
No, wait,

00:51.950 --> 00:53.094
that was my pillow.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.513
And I think I still

00:54.514 --> 00:55.930
have an ant in my head.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.474
- Don't do that,
- you'll make it mad.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.478
Look, we're going

01:00.479 --> 01:01.770
to be here all summer

00:59.184 --> 01:01.769
with Hazel,

01:01.770 --> 01:02.855
so I'd rather be her

01:02.856 --> 01:03.938
friend than her enemy.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.274
Bad idea.

01:06.525 --> 01:07.881
And the ant in my head

01:07.882 --> 01:09.235
agrees with me.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.425
But I really think I can

01:10.426 --> 01:11.613
get through to Hazel.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.826

- Can I play with you?

03:22.119 --> 03:23.641

03:25.163 --> 03:27.228
Well, I mean, not right

03:27.229 --> 03:29.292
on the tail. That would be

But then the ferocious beast

03:30.608 --> 03:31.919

03:36.885 --> 03:38.051
just bring my mom,

03:35.716 --> 03:38.051
while you're at it?

03:39.678 --> 03:41.138
No, no, no. The Kikiwaka

03:41.139 --> 03:42.597
took off when I

03:39.678 --> 03:42.596
ran into the camp.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.788
Just curious,

03:44.789 --> 03:46.977
what exactly are you

03:42.597 --> 03:46.976
a doctor of?

03:46.977 --> 03:49.019
Danger.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.356

03:50.357 --> 03:51.689

It is online.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.154
You know, Lou,

03:57.155 --> 03:58.362
I've been thinking.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.678
What's better

03:59.679 --> 04:00.990
than one friend?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.784
- A moose that can
- cook an omelet?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.953
No. Two friends!

04:05.954 --> 04:06.977
And that's what

04:06.978 --> 04:07.997
Hazel's going to get.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.833
- Who's the sucker
- you talked into that?

04:09.836 --> 04:10.917
You.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.964
Hi, Hazel, can we join you?

04:16.964 --> 04:18.923
Uh, this seat is taken!

04:18.925 --> 04:20.968
Okay, see you later!

04:20.969 --> 04:22.012
I've got a hankering

04:22.012 --> 04:23.053
for a Denver omelet.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.890
- Anyone seen a moose
- with a spatula?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.977
You know, Hazel,

04:28.978 --> 04:30.978
I just love arts and crafts.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.605
So, how can I help you?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.233
Chop off your limbs,

04:34.234 --> 04:35.858
so I can make a wind chime.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.965
I was thinking more like

04:37.966 --> 04:40.071
sewing beads into

04:35.859 --> 04:40.070
pretty patterns.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.573
Look, just because Xander

04:41.574 --> 04:43.073
is off on a camping trip,

04:43.074 --> 04:44.743
doesn't mean we can

04:44.744 --> 04:46.410
suddenly be all buddy buddy.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.454
But, maybe we could.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.165
- You know, most people
- actually like me,

04:50.168 --> 04:51.813
And do not want to turn

04:51.814 --> 04:53.460
my body parts into

04:50.165 --> 04:53.459
an arts and crafts project.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.670
Most people aren't

04:54.671 --> 04:55.879
as creative as I am.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.383
Look, obviously we got off

04:59.384 --> 05:00.883
on the wrong foot,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.470
so to show you that I really

05:02.471 --> 05:04.053
do want to be friends,

05:04.054 --> 05:05.054
I made you this.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.681
What's this?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.767
A little dog collar?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.311
Because you think

05:11.312 --> 05:12.854
I'm like a tiny,

05:09.768 --> 05:12.853
annoying little dog?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.731
Huh? Huh? Huh?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.506
Well, you are

05:17.507 --> 05:18.818
a tad yippy, but...

05:18.819 --> 05:20.539
- Actually, this is
- a friendship bracelet.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.405
Oh.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.888
There, it looks

05:24.889 --> 05:26.367
really pretty on you.

05:26.368 --> 05:29.119
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.581
Wow, you probably

05:30.582 --> 05:32.039
won't believe this,

05:32.040 --> 05:34.000
- but I've never gotten
- a friendship bracelet before.

05:34.003 --> 05:35.335
What?

05:38.505 --> 05:39.528
So, I guess your chat

05:39.529 --> 05:40.548
with Hazel went okay.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.383
You're still breathing.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.719
Yeah. You know,

05:43.720 --> 05:45.053
really I think deep down

05:42.384 --> 05:45.053
she's not a bad person.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.377
Well, I'm trying

05:56.378 --> 05:57.482
to restart my heart!

05:58.567 --> 06:00.234
Hazel, why did you do that?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.778
Because we're friends now,

06:01.779 --> 06:03.320
and friends prank each other!

Hey, why don't we go

06:08.307 --> 06:09.577
feed the ducks in the lake?

06:09.578 --> 06:10.788
Or, throw rocks at them!

06:10.789 --> 06:11.997
Great idea!

06:13.957 --> 06:15.249
Well, that backfired.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.918

06:53.913 --> 06:55.248
Yes. It is.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.460
That's not creepy at all.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.796
- Put them on.
- Maybe later.

07:01.799 --> 07:03.547
Put them on!

a selfie with you,

07:36.247 --> 07:38.166
- before the Kikiwaka
- eats you for breakfast?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.085
Of course.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.337
- But I'm sure when I emerge
- from these woods,

07:42.340 --> 07:43.547
I'll have proven that

07:43.548 --> 07:44.755
the Kikiwaka is...

07:44.756 --> 07:46.091
BOTH: For reals!

07:47.092 --> 07:48.302
And still have

07:48.303 --> 07:49.510
all my organs intact.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.533

07:50.534 --> 07:51.553
to tell yourself.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.978
Or am I just in heaven?

07:58.895 --> 08:00.710
And is this

08:00.711 --> 08:02.523
a thermographic camera?

08:02.524 --> 08:04.359
Wow, the nanometer range

08:04.360 --> 08:06.193
on this thing is crazy!

08:12.431 --> 08:13.784
know your stuff.

08:13.785 --> 08:14.974
Why don't you come track

08:14.975 --> 08:16.161
the Kikiwaka with me?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.706
We could make

08:17.707 --> 08:19.248
scientific history together.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.750
That is on my bucket list,

08:21.751 --> 08:23.315
right next to

08:23.316 --> 08:24.878
kicking a homerun.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.320
And finding the Kikiwaka

08:27.321 --> 08:29.759
would look great on

08:24.879 --> 08:29.758
my Harvard application.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.052
Talk about extracurriculars.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.325
I could finally stop

08:33.326 --> 08:34.597
reading to old people.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.643
And imagine how

08:37.644 --> 08:39.102
a discovery

08:36.182 --> 08:39.101
of this magnitude

08:39.102 --> 08:40.125
could advance

08:40.126 --> 08:41.145
scientific research.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.604
Count me in.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.941
Since when have you

08:43.942 --> 08:45.274
been interested in science?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.027
I'm not. But if we

08:47.028 --> 08:48.777
capture the Kikiwaka alive,

08:48.778 --> 08:50.447
I can put it on display

08:50.448 --> 08:52.114
and make a fortune...

08:52.115 --> 08:55.284
Well, another fortune.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.204
Great! Let's get in the field

08:57.205 --> 08:59.122
and prove that

08:55.285 --> 08:59.121
the Kikiwaka is...

08:59.122 --> 09:00.874
For reals!

09:03.251 --> 09:05.003

- to say out there.

09:14.368 --> 09:15.596

09:17.392 --> 09:19.184
with Hazel have been

09:15.597 --> 09:19.183
the worst days in my life,

09:19.184 --> 09:21.374
and I once got locked in

09:21.375 --> 09:23.563

09:19.184 --> 09:23.562

09:23.563 --> 09:24.878

16:09.408 --> 16:10.552
that was amazing!

16:10.553 --> 16:11.970
Thanks, Zuri.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.056
I've just proven

16:13.057 --> 16:14.139
another legend is...

16:14.140 --> 16:15.807
For reals!

16:15.808 --> 16:16.809
And cut!

16:17.852 --> 16:18.977
Whoa!

16:18.978 --> 16:21.188
That was awesome, Harold!

16:21.189 --> 16:22.940
- Go ahead and
- grab yourself a donut.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.132
What in the world

16:27.133 --> 16:28.778
is going on here?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.052
Great television,

16:30.053 --> 16:31.323
that's what's going on!

16:31.324 --> 16:32.742
You mean,

16:32.743 --> 16:34.159
this was all fake?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.620
Yep, but your fear was real.

16:36.621 --> 16:37.685
My viewers are

16:37.686 --> 16:38.747
going to eat that up.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.749
So you bamboozled us?

16:40.750 --> 16:41.835
If that means

16:41.836 --> 16:42.919
I fooled you,

16:40.750 --> 16:42.919
then yeah!

16:44.378 --> 16:45.922
Then that was Harold

16:45.923 --> 16:47.464
who chased us up the tree

16:47.465 --> 16:49.383
- the first week
- we were at camp?

16:49.386 --> 16:50.800
Huh? No.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.220
- Before yesterday,
- we were in Mexico,

16:52.223 --> 16:53.638
Chasing a Great Dane

16:53.639 --> 16:55.056
dressed up

16:52.220 --> 16:55.056
as a chupacabra.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.017
Now if you'll excuse me,

16:59.018 --> 17:00.458
I'm off to Area 51

17:00.459 --> 17:01.896
to prove that aliens are...

17:02.855 --> 17:04.648
Not going to happen.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.275
Let's go.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.492
For reals!

17:15.701 --> 17:17.703
But that is the last time!

17:21.082 --> 17:22.291
Let's go!

17:22.292 --> 17:23.500
Scrape off that gum.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.835
I don't have all day.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.756
Ew, this one

17:27.757 --> 17:29.673
has a tooth in it!

17:29.674 --> 17:31.176
You know what's worse

17:31.177 --> 17:32.677
than dried gum?

17:29.674 --> 17:32.676
Dried boogers.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.699
Ooh. One just

17:33.700 --> 17:34.719
fell in my mouth!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.763
(RETCHING)

17:36.764 --> 17:37.933
Look, Hazel,

17:37.934 --> 17:39.100
I understand

17:36.764 --> 17:39.099
that you're mad,

17:39.100 --> 17:40.164
but I really did want

17:40.165 --> 17:41.226
to be your friend.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.644
I'm not mad.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.397
- I can't help it
- if your name came up

17:44.400 --> 17:45.773
On the counselor

17:45.774 --> 17:47.149
chore wheel

17:44.397 --> 17:47.148
for gum detail.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.109
And garbage detail.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.112
And goat enema detail.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.488
That's not even a thing!

17:53.489 --> 17:54.906
Actually, it is.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.325
That goat gets backed up.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.727
We've been

18:01.728 --> 18:03.164
stomping for hours!

18:03.165 --> 18:04.834
Ow! Toe cramp!

18:04.835 --> 18:06.501
Toe cramp!

18:06.502 --> 18:07.900
I never thought I'd miss

18:07.901 --> 18:09.296
emptying that goat.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.653
Hey, someone's got to

18:10.654 --> 18:12.008
make the cranberry juice.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.283
(CRYING)

18:15.284 --> 18:16.721
I don't know if this

18:13.843 --> 18:16.720
red is the cranberries

18:16.721 --> 18:18.472
or the blood from my blisters.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.142
Stop whining

18:21.143 --> 18:22.392
and keep stomping.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.582
Oh, by the way,

18:23.583 --> 18:24.769
you missed one.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.979
Oh, really?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.023
Which one?

18:27.024 --> 18:28.064
Oh, that one.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.358
(HAZEL SCREAMS)

18:30.735 --> 18:32.736
Looks like you got it...

18:32.737 --> 18:33.903
With your face!

18:33.904 --> 18:35.280
(LAUGHS)

18:35.281 --> 18:36.575
(SCREAMS)

18:36.576 --> 18:37.866
ALL: Oh!

18:37.867 --> 18:39.493
- (SCREAMS)
- (LAUGHING)

18:41.329 --> 18:42.559
Stop, stop!

18:42.560 --> 18:43.789
I have cranberries

18:41.329 --> 18:43.788
in my ears!

18:43.789 --> 18:45.062
That's the one place

18:45.063 --> 18:46.333
I don't have them.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.543
(GASPING)

18:49.378 --> 18:50.796
(SCREAMS)

18:51.922 --> 18:53.089
(ALL GASPING)

18:53.090 --> 18:55.676
(GRUNTING AND SCREAMING)

18:56.844 --> 18:58.762
Stop it!

18:58.763 --> 19:00.327
You've been

19:00.328 --> 19:01.890
torturing us all day!

19:01.891 --> 19:03.308
Preach, sister!

19:03.309 --> 19:05.041
And you know what?

19:05.042 --> 19:06.770
We completely deserve it!

19:06.771 --> 19:08.397
You tell her... What?

19:09.899 --> 19:10.983
Lou, what we did was wrong.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.132
And, Hazel,

19:14.133 --> 19:15.987
I am so sorry.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.907
- But you have to know,
- in the beginning,

19:17.910 --> 19:19.784
- I really wanted
- to be your friend.

19:19.787 --> 19:21.243
- I didn't.
- But Emma made me.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.892
But then why

19:23.893 --> 19:25.121
didn't we stay friends?

19:25.122 --> 19:26.540
(SIGHS) Because

19:26.541 --> 19:27.957
you made it so hard.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.501
LOU: More like impossible.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.066
Kinda like trying to

19:31.067 --> 19:32.630
swallow a porcupine whole.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.800
- You scared us
- with a fake snake,

19:35.803 --> 19:37.197
You tried to make us

19:37.198 --> 19:38.593
throw rocks at ducks,

19:38.594 --> 19:40.513
- and you mangled
- Lou's thumbs!

19:40.516 --> 19:42.286
And you never once asked us

19:42.287 --> 19:44.057
what we wanted to do.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.850
I thought we were having fun.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.395
Every time I looked at Lou,

19:47.396 --> 19:48.938
she was giving me

19:45.851 --> 19:48.937
the two thumbs up.

19:48.938 --> 19:49.981
That's because

19:49.982 --> 19:51.023
they were in splints!

19:53.067 --> 19:54.965
Hazel, real friendship

19:54.966 --> 19:56.861
cannot be so one-sided.

19:56.862 --> 19:57.863
You can't just

19:57.864 --> 19:58.864
order people around.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.825
(SIGHS) But that's

20:00.826 --> 20:02.785
the only way I'm sure

19:58.864 --> 20:02.785
to get what I want.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.955
Oh, now I hear it.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.708
Okay, maybe I was

20:08.709 --> 20:10.459
a little hard

20:06.956 --> 20:10.458
on you guys.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.918
A little?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.421
I have an ant eating

20:13.422 --> 20:14.922
a cranberry in my cranium!

20:16.132 --> 20:18.197
But it's not easy

20:18.198 --> 20:20.261
being head counselor,

20:16.132 --> 20:20.260
and Gladys' niece.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.928
That's a lot of pressure.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.929
Tell me about it.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.994
Try having a mom

20:23.995 --> 20:25.056
who's an ex-supermodel

20:25.057 --> 20:26.538
and the head of her own

20:26.539 --> 20:28.017
multi-national corporation.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.018
You mean...

20:29.019 --> 20:30.417
We have something

20:30.418 --> 20:31.813
in common?

20:31.814 --> 20:33.481
(CHUCKLES) Looks like it.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.297
So, maybe we could be

20:35.298 --> 20:37.110
real friends.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.028
(SIGHS) I don't know.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.238
What about Xander?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.345
We both like him,

20:41.346 --> 20:42.449
and he still hasn't decided

20:42.450 --> 20:43.743
- which one of us
- he likes better.

20:43.746 --> 20:44.910
BOTH: He hasn't?

20:47.872 --> 20:49.957
(ROARING)

20:52.209 --> 20:53.919
(ROARING CONTINUES)

20:57.047 --> 20:58.799
(GROANS)

20:59.800 --> 21:01.134
That was pathetic!

21:01.135 --> 21:02.240
You're about as scary

21:02.241 --> 21:03.345
as a puppy in a tutu.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.972
Do I really have to do this?

21:05.973 --> 21:07.475
Yes. I'm going to have

21:07.476 --> 21:08.975
a bunch of kids here tomorrow

21:08.976 --> 21:10.124
who are going to pay

21:10.125 --> 21:11.269
to see the Kikiwaka.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.437
So?

21:12.438 --> 21:13.815
So, I don't want them

21:13.816 --> 21:15.190
to be disappointed.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.547
Either you scare

21:16.548 --> 21:17.901
the sunscreen off of them,

21:17.902 --> 21:19.404
or I'm gonna tell your boss

21:19.405 --> 21:20.904
that you're a fraud.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.427
No! Please don't,

21:22.428 --> 21:23.948
I'll never get a real job.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.118
- All I have is
- a master's degree in acting.

21:26.121 --> 21:27.182
You'd never know it

21:27.183 --> 21:28.245
from that performance.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.436
I really thought we were

21:31.437 --> 21:32.832
about to find the Kikiwaka.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.417
Me too.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.463
I guess Mrs. Kipling

21:36.464 --> 21:38.506
is still the only

21:34.418 --> 21:38.505
ravenous beast in my life.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.445
You know, Ravi,

21:40.446 --> 21:42.384
what you did in that cave

21:38.506 --> 21:42.383
was really brave.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.178
You mean, falling and

21:44.179 --> 21:45.970
eating a mouthful of dirt?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.453
No, I mean picking me up

21:47.454 --> 21:48.932
and carrying me to safety.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.476
- (CHUCKLES)
- Well...

21:50.479 --> 21:52.436
Carrying me a few inches.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.606
I think I even felt

21:55.607 --> 21:56.689
a muscle in your arm.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.066
Really?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.110
It could have been

21:59.111 --> 22:00.151
a mosquito bite.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.612
I swell up like a balloon.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.094
Ugh, what is that

22:04.095 --> 22:05.573
horrible smell?

22:05.574 --> 22:07.742
(CREATURE BELLOWING)

22:07.743 --> 22:09.202
What was that?

22:09.203 --> 22:10.643
Do you think it's Dr. Brody

22:10.644 --> 22:12.080
trying to trick us again?

22:12.081 --> 22:14.499
No, he is back with Zuri!

22:14.500 --> 22:15.710
Turn off your flashlight

22:15.711 --> 22:16.919
and hide behind that bush!

22:32.478 --> 22:33.936
went into the camp!
