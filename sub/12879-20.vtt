00:01.751 --> 00:02.419
<i>Astral: Previously on The</i>
<i>Other Kingdom.</i>

00:02.502 --> 00:04.337
You're going to
destroy Athenia.

00:04.421 --> 00:05.088
Form a chain!

00:05.171 --> 00:06.715
Wait for me!

00:08.132 --> 00:09.467
Stop!

00:10.135 --> 00:13.054
I wanna thank Peter
for saving the woods.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.598
Did you find out
about the boy?

00:17.726 --> 00:20.770
{\an1}For your Valor and for saving
the kingdom of Athenia,

00:20.854 --> 00:25.150
I crown you warrior princess of
the Second Kingdom.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.652
Princess Astral!

00:27.736 --> 00:32.448
<i>(applause)</i>

00:32.531 --> 00:41.291
Thank you, thank you, fairies,
elves, giants, and Tristan.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.668
<i>(phone vibrating)</i>

00:46.671 --> 00:48.757
<i>(phone vibrating)</i>

00:48.840 --> 00:52.135
I gotta get me some
Velcro sheets.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.637
<i>(phone vibrating)</i>

00:57.557 --> 00:58.600
"Where are you?"

00:58.683 --> 00:59.017
Shoot!

00:59.100 --> 00:59.976
I'm on my way.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.352
<i>Peaseblossom: I'm</i>
<i>not letting you go.</i>

01:01.436 --> 01:02.145
Come now, Peasey.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.229
I'll come visit.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.480
No you won't.

01:04.563 --> 01:08.318
Once you leave here,
you can't come back.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.778
{\an3}Oh.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.279
Maybe you can
come visit me?

01:11.362 --> 01:13.114
As a light maybe?

01:13.198 --> 01:14.491
But just a light.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.117
The brightest
light in my life.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.119
Whaaaaa!!!!

01:21.873 --> 01:23.458
He helped to
save Athenia?

01:23.541 --> 01:24.459
{\an1}This kid?

01:24.542 --> 01:26.628
Ugh, I'll be glad
to see him gone.

01:26.711 --> 01:30.256
{\an1}Maybe that silly Peaseblossom
will finally stop talking.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.510
Oh, how did the King
and Queen react

01:33.593 --> 01:35.804
when you told them
about the Spartanian.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.680
They were astounded!

01:37.764 --> 01:39.349
And confounded.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.517
You haven't told them.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.810
They have to
know this.

01:41.893 --> 01:42.477
This changes everything.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.354
{\an1}You've traveled
far, Oswald.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.147
{\an1}It might be best to
take advantage

01:46.231 --> 01:48.691
{\an1}of the lavender pools
we've prepared for you.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.901
Even in emergencies,

01:49.984 --> 01:53.196
I'm sure King Oberon would
prefer a less rancid messenger.

01:53.279 --> 01:57.242
King Oberon would prefer
the musk of a warrior.

01:57.325 --> 02:00.453
He will want to
know this news.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.832
The lavender bath
is this way?

02:03.915 --> 02:05.542
I'll see you
in a bit.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.548
So has Tristan asked
you to the dance yet?

02:11.631 --> 02:12.382
{\an3}Not yet.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.217
But hopefully he'll
ask me today.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.301
{\an1}The dance is
tomorrow.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.637
Yeah, I know.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.392
Aloha, losers.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.561
That means hello
and goodbye.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.272
But losers is the same
in every language.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.191
<i>Ta da!</i>

02:30.275 --> 02:32.861
What have you done?

02:32.944 --> 02:34.571
<i>Astral: I'm not</i>
<i>like other kids.</i>

02:34.654 --> 02:36.781
<i>I guess you could</i>
<i>call me different.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:38.741
<i>Back home, I'm</i>
<i>a princess.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:42.245
<i>But here I could be</i>
<i>whoever I want to be.</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:45.540
<i>Go to school, make new</i>
<i>friends, explore your ways,</i>

02:45.623 --> 02:47.709
<i>and have</i>
<i>some fun.</i>

02:47.792 --> 02:50.253
<i>Hiding my fairy powers</i>
<i>isn't always easy.</i>

02:50.336 --> 02:53.923
<i>But my friends help me</i>
<i>when things go wrong.</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:55.258
<i>I have to make a</i>
<i>choice soon.</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:58.219
<i>Your world or</i>
<i>my home.</i>

02:58.303 --> 02:59.429
Time is
running out.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.348
{\an9}<i>â™ª</i>

03:05.518 --> 03:06.269
Principal Williams!

03:06.352 --> 03:06.769
Principal Williams!

03:06.853 --> 03:07.604
<i>No time to talk.</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:09.355
Make an appointment
with my office.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.481
Send an email.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.610
Principal Williams, you agreed
to a Fairy Costume Ball.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.611
{\an3}Yes I did.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.738
But Hailey decorated the
gym for her beach theme.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.822
Hailey wouldn't--

03:17.906 --> 03:18.615
actually, she would.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.490
Don't listen to
them, Aunt Maddie!

03:19.574 --> 03:21.326
Now, I know you chose
the fairy theme,

03:21.409 --> 03:23.620
but these two were
very distracted

03:23.703 --> 03:24.370
with their save
the woods stuff.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.246
Like, whatever.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.624
I couldn't let the
dance fall apart.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.207
It's way too
important for--

03:30.627 --> 03:31.920
the school.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.212
<i>Astral: We've got</i>
<i>36 hours.</i>

03:33.296 --> 03:35.465
And we have everything
ready to be set up.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.132
Guys, bad news.

03:36.215 --> 03:37.383
We're gonna need
a new bower.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.511
<i>I bet Brendoni a steak dinner</i>
<i>he couldn't jump over it.</i>

03:40.595 --> 03:42.513
And let's just say, I'm
eatin' good tonight!

03:42.597 --> 03:43.640
We'll fix that.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.350
Principal Williams, we will
have the gym decorated

03:45.433 --> 03:47.769
in time for
the dance.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.813
Sure, if you want to give
the Mona Lisa a face lift.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.815
<i>But why, when the gym</i>
<i>is already decorated</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:54.817
{\an1}in a perfectly acceptable,
totally superior,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.569
{\an1}completely better than
yours theme?

03:56.653 --> 03:58.321
{\an1}They won the theme
fair and square.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.323
Astral, you sure you can have
the gym decorated by tomorrow?

04:00.406 --> 04:00.615
Yes.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.492
We will.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.661
{\an1}I want my decorations
packed neatly.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.245
I need the deposit back
from the rental place.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.420
We've got a lot
of work to do.

04:15.004 --> 04:15.630
<i>Morgan: Gnome.</i>

04:15.713 --> 04:15.922
<i>Fairy.</i>

04:16.005 --> 04:16.880
<i>Way.</i>

04:16.964 --> 04:18.173
What?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.510
Last night, Hailey sent a text
to the entire school saying that

04:20.593 --> 04:22.387
the costume ball is
now beach-themed.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.513
How are we going
to fix this?

04:23.596 --> 04:26.683
Hit reply all, and tell everyone
she's a wackadoodle.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.725
Can't you just--

04:27.809 --> 04:29.227
--and do the
work for us?

04:29.310 --> 04:30.228
That only works with
cleaning things up.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.354
Not something like this.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.898
<i>Decorating a</i>
<i>gym is too big.</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:35.483
{\an1}Hey, What's up
with Hailey?

04:35.566 --> 04:37.694
She's walking up and down
the hall muttering about

04:37.777 --> 04:39.862
how fate is a
cruel mistress.

04:39.946 --> 04:40.363
So.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.323
The dance.

04:42.407 --> 04:42.991
Tomorrow night.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.367
Who are you
going with?

04:44.450 --> 04:45.410
I haven't asked anybody.

04:45.493 --> 04:45.952
<i>Morgan: Cool!</i>

04:46.035 --> 04:47.370
Neither has Astral.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.999
But you are
going, right?

04:51.082 --> 04:51.791
No.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.918
I mean, Everyone packed
in a gym,

04:54.002 --> 04:56.921
wondering if they look okay or
what to say to each other.

04:57.005 --> 04:57.964
<i>It's so awkward.</i>

04:58.047 --> 04:59.424
I mean, who
would want that?

04:59.507 --> 05:00.675
I guess I would.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.428
The dance is gonna
be really magical.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.764
I really wish
you'd be there.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.724
Think about it.

05:10.977 --> 05:11.644
Wow.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.356
I, gotta go to
gym practice.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.441
You're in the gym.

05:16.524 --> 05:24.907
Y-yes, and I mean, I have to
go to library practice.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.159
Ugh, why did
I say that?

05:27.952 --> 05:31.581
For a second I thought he was
going to ask you to the dance.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.665
Other boys.

05:32.749 --> 05:36.711
For extraordinary acts of
valor, I, Oberon VIII,

05:36.794 --> 05:39.922
Ruler of the Seventh Realm,
servant of the First Kingdom,

05:40.006 --> 05:43.801
give to you, Winston of
England, the heart of a fairy.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.927
A heart?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.930
A fairy heart cannot lie, has
empathy for the broken,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.892
cares for the world, and faces
all difficulty with courage.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.728
There is no greater gift
we can give an Other.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.443
Fly light and shine
bright, little one.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.402
Thank you, your
Highness.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.993
What are you doing?

06:09.077 --> 06:09.577
Getting my books
for Geography?

06:09.660 --> 06:10.286
No, with Astral.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.622
You two totally
like each other.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.957
Why are you being so brutal
about the dance?

06:15.041 --> 06:15.917
I don't--

06:16.000 --> 06:16.793
You're sending her all
these mixed signals.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.461
If I were her, I'd be
confused too.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.045
You're right!

06:19.128 --> 06:20.505
I am so terrible
at this.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.341
Of course I'm right!

06:23.424 --> 06:24.592
Wait, what?

06:24.675 --> 06:26.844
I've been planning this thing
where I ask her to the dance

06:26.928 --> 06:28.346
in this fun way
with flowers

06:28.429 --> 06:30.348
and I am messing
the whole thing up.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.642
Might just be easier to
be straight with her.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.059
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

06:33.142 --> 06:33.851
You're right.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.979
I promise, I will
totally ask her.

06:37.063 --> 06:37.980
Thanks.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.107
You got
this, dude!

06:39.190 --> 06:40.525
Seize the
day, dude!

06:40.608 --> 06:41.484
Believe in your
dreams, dude!

06:43.569 --> 06:44.737
You are a wise
man, Dee-vo.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.452
Peasey, I know you're
hiding from me.

06:51.536 --> 06:55.873
Okay, I'll have to be leaving
without giving you your gift.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.584
<i>Gift???</i>

06:58.668 --> 07:00.086
Why weren't you
at my ceremony?

07:00.169 --> 07:01.712
Well, I'm angry
with you.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.713
Oh, don't be
this way.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.008
Before you got here I was
just Peaseblossom.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.885
Silly little, frighteningly
intelligent,

07:07.969 --> 07:10.054
stunningly beautiful
Peaseblossom.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.097
Good self-image.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.057
And now you're gonna head
back to Englandtown,

07:13.141 --> 07:15.893
and probably have fancy
dances like Princess Astral.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.395
You don't think maybe
I'd like a fancy dance?

07:17.478 --> 07:19.689
Well I would,
Winston, I would!

07:19.772 --> 07:20.815
But where am I?

07:20.898 --> 07:22.400
Exactly where
you found me.

07:22.483 --> 07:26.696
Hanging from a boring old tree,
being my effervescent self.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.405
I'm sorry, tree.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.574
You're not much
of a dancer.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.408
Hmphm.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.702
<i>Morgan: The dance</i>
<i>is sold out.</i>

07:32.785 --> 07:33.870
<i>Everyone's coming.</i>

07:33.953 --> 07:34.495
That's great!

07:34.579 --> 07:36.831
This is a disaster.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.499
<i>We've barely started</i>
<i>the fairy theme</i>

07:38.583 --> 07:41.669
and the only thing that's been
deflated is my self-esteem.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.172
And don't even get me
started on Tristan.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.173
I'm really sorry.

07:45.256 --> 07:45.882
It's okay.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.051
Yesterday I had
a huge win.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.679
Athenia and my
family are safe.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.056
This dance will be a
great way to celebrate.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.726
But it's not fair.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.937
In all the movies, when the
princess saves her Kingdom

08:00.021 --> 08:01.522
<i>she celebrates</i>
<i>with a cute boy!</i>

08:01.606 --> 08:03.566
<i>Astral: I thought</i>
<i>so too.</i>

08:03.649 --> 08:08.070
But maybe this princess doesn't
need some "cute boy."

08:08.154 --> 08:08.946
{\an1}Seriously?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.200
You know who I want
to celebrate with?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.451
My friends.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.620
And if Tristan doesn't want to
come to the dance, then so what?

08:15.703 --> 08:19.498
Okay, when I give you
the signal start playing.

08:19.582 --> 08:19.916
<i>Astral: It's cool.</i>

08:19.999 --> 08:21.542
<i>I'm over it.</i>

08:21.626 --> 08:22.543
I'm done with Tristan.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.761
{\an3}So, Now?

08:32.845 --> 08:33.971
{\an3}No.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.472
{\an1}Do I still get my
five bucks?

08:35.556 --> 08:37.058
{\an3}What?

08:37.140 --> 08:37.892
{\an3}No!

08:40.727 --> 08:42.145
{\an1}Tris?

08:42.230 --> 08:42.605
You are so sweet.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.648
{\an3}What?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.233
{\an1}Flowers!

08:45.316 --> 08:45.983
Oh my gosh.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.777
{\an1}You've finally come
to your senses

08:47.860 --> 08:49.612
and you're asking
me to the dance!

08:49.695 --> 08:52.907
{\an1}This is every bit as magical
as I dreamed it would be!

08:55.826 --> 08:57.161
Sorry.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.247
Spit valve.

08:59.330 --> 08:59.997
I'll just...

09:01.707 --> 09:03.668
Uh, sure.

09:03.751 --> 09:04.460
Whatever.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.587
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at seven.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.922
Let's.

09:08.005 --> 09:08.756

09:08.839 --> 09:09.882
Wardrobe.

09:21.018 --> 09:21.269

09:21.686 --> 09:23.062
{\an1}Fantastic!

09:23.938 --> 09:24.313
{\an3}What?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.648
Trolls can lie!

09:25.731 --> 09:27.692
We haven't had
enough time.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.860
Well, we'll just put up
more twinkle lights.

09:29.944 --> 09:30.653
Twinkle lights
solve everything.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.737
Energy crisis?

09:31.821 --> 09:33.531
Just add twinkle
lights!

09:33.614 --> 09:35.658
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

09:35.741 --> 09:36.617
Maybe it's just us.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.161

will think it's lame.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.749

09:43.833 --> 09:46.794

Vote Hailey and Tristan for
Fall Dance King and Queen?

09:50.131 --> 09:52.133
Hailey has lost it!

09:52.216 --> 09:55.136
Tristan told me he was going
to ask you to the dance.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.012
Must have changed
his mind.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.889
This is so wrong on
many, many levels.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.141
Let's just not go.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.935
We'll stay home, order a pizza,
and have a much better time.

10:03.019 --> 10:03.686
We'll forget about
the whole thing.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.812
I'm not gonna
miss this

10:04.895 --> 10:08.524
because some Other boy
doesn't want to go with me.

10:08.607 --> 10:09.859
Morgan and Brendoni
are going together.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.569
Devon, you and I
will go together

10:11.652 --> 10:14.030
and we'll all have
fun as friends.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.531
The Fantastic Foursome!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.158
Yeah, we'll have
a great time.

10:17.241 --> 10:17.658
Right Brendoni?

10:17.742 --> 10:18.868
Sure, Tristan.

10:18.951 --> 10:23.039
You've got your dreamy blue eyes
and pretty-boy good looks,

10:23.122 --> 10:25.708

to wear that crown.

<i>Astral: Why do I want this</i>

10:35.634 --> 10:37.553
After saving my family,
and Athenia

10:37.636 --> 10:38.721
it shouldn't feel
so important.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.724
<i>A dance is where you can</i>
<i>feel the pure energy of Others.</i>

10:41.807 --> 10:46.562

10:48.647 --> 10:49.690

10:49.774 --> 10:51.108

10:51.192 --> 10:51.859
Let me fix your horns.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.031
<i>Morgan: Hey guys!</i>

11:00.868 --> 11:02.578
Lookin' good, Brendoni.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.246
Thanks, I
make it work.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.498
You too Dev.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.918
For someone who planned to skip
a dance, you really came around.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.546
I guess I got a little troll
in my soul after all.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.965
It's where a touch of a
hand is so electric,

11:15.049 --> 11:17.968
<i>your heart jumps and</i>
<i>you don't know why.</i>

11:19.970 --> 11:23.557
Where you're so nervous,
looking into a pair of eyes

11:23.641 --> 11:25.726
that make you feel safer
than ever before.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.606
<i>And you don't wanna say a word</i>
<i>because you're afraid if you do,</i>

11:30.689 --> 11:32.024
<i>the moment will disappear.</i>

11:35.778 --> 11:40.241
<i>That moment when you</i>
<i>believe someone likes you.</i>

11:40.324 --> 11:41.826
How could I
not want that?

11:41.909 --> 11:44.120
<i>Titania: We should do something</i>
<i>to make tonight special.</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:44.787
Astral's earned it.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.498
We shouldn't interfere.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.750
What's the good in
being King and Queen

11:49.834 --> 11:52.128
if we can't bend the
rules occasionally?

11:53.879 --> 11:54.755
<i>Morgan: Let's hope</i>

11:54.839 --> 11:56.799

Okay, slow down!

20:33.190 --> 20:36.652
Astral, get away from
that Spartanian.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.027
{\an1}What?

20:37.110 --> 20:38.195
<i>Versitude!</i>

20:38.278 --> 20:40.614
You do not command
the Princess.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.490
How could you
not tell us!

20:41.573 --> 20:45.535
I was only doing
what's best for Athenia.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.370
{\an1}I'll deal with you
later, Reed.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.663
Mom, I don't
understand.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.667
Oswald discovered that Tristan
is the Lost Prince of Spartania.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.334
{\an3}What?

20:52.417 --> 20:53.627
He will be King
one day.

20:53.710 --> 20:54.336
Tristan?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.462
Is this true?

20:55.545 --> 20:56.463
I don't know.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.174
I don't know where I came
from or who I am.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.176
{\an1}The ancient leaves
tell of a lost prince

21:01.259 --> 21:02.678
who will conquer
all of Athenia.

21:02.761 --> 21:03.512
{\an3}Come, boy.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.555
It's time you finally
returned home.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.223
No!

21:06.306 --> 21:08.308
I'm not going
anywhere!

21:08.392 --> 21:09.434
Don't do this!

21:09.518 --> 21:11.103
I am your King.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.521
You will do as
I command.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.313
Astral!

21:13.397 --> 21:14.106
Tristan!

21:14.189 --> 21:15.065
Astral!

21:15.148 --> 21:17.150
It's time to leave
Astral.
