00:06.960 --> 00:08.580
********

00:08.580 --> 00:12.420
I also bought this.  
A chinese knockoff of your book.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.420
What?

00:13.420 --> 00:19.050
"dealbreaker: the book for you man
no good,by lesbianyellowsourfruit.

00:19.050 --> 00:20.550
" so,uh,what do you need from me?

00:20.550 --> 00:23.230
Ah,well,our new cast
member starts today.

00:23.230 --> 00:25.120
Oh,of course,the robot.  I liked him.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.810
We don't know anything about him.

00:26.810 --> 00:29.750
I don't think his real name is partybot.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.750
I don't know what he looks like.
 I don't know what he talks like.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.660
I certainly don't know if he can act.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.290
Lemon,what did you once
say to me about acting?

00:35.290 --> 00:37.260
Just hit your marks,stay in your light,

00:37.260 --> 00:39.290
and do the same thing
every take for continuity.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.620
See?  Anyone can do it.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.200
Miss lemon,security called. 
Our new actor just checked in.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.150
He'll be on six in a couple minutes.

00:48.150 --> 00:49.480
Let's go introduce ourselves.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.270
This is so exciting.

00:51.270 --> 00:53.820
Maybe we should practice the
welcome song i distributed.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.730
?makin' a new friend
??sure ain't easy ??

00:56.730 --> 00:59.980
and that's how two become one ?

01:00.020 --> 01:01.870
lemon,do you have any
plans for dinner tonight?

01:01.870 --> 01:05.010
I do,i bought an activia
microwavable panini.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.780
Good god,have dinner with me.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.190
- Just the two of
us?  - Yes.  - Okay.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.900
Hey,jackie d.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.100
I hope the new dude isn't
impossible to work with,

01:12.100 --> 01:13.740
like some people i know.

01:13.780 --> 01:15.680
- I hope he's educated. 
- I hope he hates toofer.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.880
I hope he likes janitor hugs.

01:18.070 --> 01:19.290
Somebody's coming.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.920
Oh,no.  Is that the new guy?

01:23.920 --> 01:26.720
What?  No,it's me,lutz.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.240
I've worked here for three years.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.120
I gave you that car i won.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.580
Come on.

01:35.670 --> 01:39.080
Hi.  I think i'm supposed to be on tv.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.680
Jack donaghy.  Good to see you again.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.520
Oh,hey.  I'm jack...  Baker.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.440
So guess there's two jacks here now.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.630
I don't think there are.

01:47.630 --> 01:50.260
Welcome aboard...  Danny.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.560
Hi,danny.  I'm liz.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.070
Did he just change my name?

01:54.070 --> 01:56.820
Let's go look at your
dressing room...  Danny.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.260
He looks like all the
guys in my magazines.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.810
This is unbelievable.

02:03.810 --> 02:06.770
Last week,i was just a street
performer making 50 bucks a day

02:06.770 --> 02:11.950
and getting memory loss from all the
silver paint fumes,and now i'm...  Um...

02:11.950 --> 02:14.570
- You're on tgs. 
- I'm on tgs?

02:14.570 --> 02:17.860
This is unbelievable! I
haven't done any real acting

02:17.860 --> 02:20.300
since i was in that high school
football movie back in ottawa.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.500
You're canadian?

02:21.500 --> 02:27.310
All right,hosers,i want all 12 of us
fighting for every meter on all three downs!

02:27.310 --> 02:31.110
We're gonna make this a boxing day
the prime minister will never forget!

02:31.390 --> 02:33.850
Okay,well,you don't
have zero experience.

02:33.850 --> 02:35.310
I just don't want to screw up.

02:35.310 --> 02:38.420
Like,what do you wish you'd
known on your first day here?

02:38.420 --> 02:40.250
Oh,well,don't eat prop food.

02:40.250 --> 02:43.020
They spray something on
it that messes you up.

02:43.550 --> 02:45.140
Hello,mr.  Baker.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.810
I'm kenneth,one of the nbc pages.

02:46.810 --> 02:49.450
I'm going out to get miss
maroney and mr.  Jordan's lunch.

02:49.450 --> 02:50.500
And what would you like?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.210
Oh,thanks.  I'll probably
just go grab something later.

02:53.210 --> 02:55.290
Can i get you anything while i'm out?

02:58.690 --> 03:02.150

03:26.770 --> 03:27.890
??okay,here's one.

03:27.890 --> 03:30.760
You can have the powers of
superman for an entire year,

03:30.760 --> 03:34.710
but you can only have one sexual
partner for the rest of your life.

03:34.710 --> 03:37.670
Two questions: must i live
by superman's moral code,

03:37.670 --> 03:39.570
and will the sex woman get older?

03:39.570 --> 03:42.770
- Yes and yes. 
- Forget it.  No deal.

03:48.510 --> 03:50.760
I don't want your
sleeve to catch on fire.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.470
Why would my sleeve catch on fire?

03:55.280 --> 03:56.800
You know me well,sir.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.270
I often know what you're
going to do before you do it.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.490
- What am i going to do next? 
- What am i going to do next?

04:01.600 --> 04:04.010
Speaking of which,i made some calls.

04:04.010 --> 04:08.270
And there's interest in a dealbreakers
talk show with you hosting.

04:08.270 --> 04:10.030
Spit take.  Are you serious?

04:10.030 --> 04:11.950
Absolutely.  You're
becoming a commodity.

04:11.950 --> 04:13.720
I say we book the
studio,shoot the pilot,

04:13.720 --> 04:15.210
and take it from there
what do you think?

04:15.210 --> 04:18.200
Wow,okay.  Let's do it.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.720
- i knew you would say yes,lemon. 
- i knew you would say yes,lemon.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.890
Hey,pete,i have question.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.180
Is camera left my left or my right?

04:28.530 --> 04:29.690
Here's some advice,danny.

04:29.690 --> 04:31.140
Learn as little as you can.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.680
'Cause when you know
things,people ask you to do things.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.230
And then everyone starts coming
to you with their problems.

04:36.230 --> 04:38.790
That's why when someone comes to me
with something i don't want to deal with,

04:38.790 --> 04:41.570
i say,"oh,no,my kid's
sick," and take off.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.690
You have any kids?  No.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.280
I mean,i pretty much
raised my little sister,

04:47.280 --> 04:49.390
'cause my mom ...that
must have been hard.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.520
no,my kid is sick.

04:52.310 --> 04:55.110
A dealbreakers talk
show?  That's amazing,liz.

04:55.110 --> 04:58.820
Liz lemon,you are blowing up like
a balloon with a grenade in it.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.700
Who else are you meeting with?

05:00.700 --> 05:01.380
What do you mean?

05:01.380 --> 05:03.010
You know,like producers and agents.

05:03.010 --> 05:05.370
No onei'm doing it with jack.
 For sheinhardtuniversal.

05:05.370 --> 05:08.110
Liz,you can't just go with the
first person who comes along.

05:08.110 --> 05:09.960
I know,because i've been burned.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.190
Do you remember when i
was first starting out,

05:11.190 --> 05:14.090
and i signed a tenyear deal with
that karaoke machine company?

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:27.240 --> 05:30.770
??when i first got big,i made
bad business decisions too.

05:30.770 --> 05:34.060
Which is how i got stuck having
to plug wade bogg's carpet world

05:34.060 --> 05:36.380
five times whenever i appear on screen.

05:36.380 --> 05:37.520
You have to plug what?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.050
Wade bogg's carpet world.

05:39.050 --> 05:42.030
Wade bogg's carpet world.
 Wade bogg's carpet world.

05:42.030 --> 05:44.130
Liz,jack would never
take a first offer,right?

05:44.130 --> 05:46.220
He's taking advantage
of your relationship.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.110
He knows you're special,like a
black stripper with blue eyes.

05:49.110 --> 05:51.220
You have to test the marketplace.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.470
But i already told jack
that i would do it with him.

05:53.470 --> 05:54.630
Did you sign anything?

05:54.980 --> 05:57.200
Then he'll understand.  It's business.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.810
I'm gonna set you up
with someone at my agency

05:58.810 --> 06:00.590
and make sure that you do this right.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.620
And one last piece of advice,liz lemon,

06:02.620 --> 06:06.430
from someone that's been on this
side of the business for a long time.

06:06.890 --> 06:09.170
Wade bogg's carpet world.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.970
That was actually good advice.

06:16.380 --> 06:19.480
From now on,i shall call
us the problem solvers.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.940
Yo,ken.  Do you have a
problem that needs solving?

06:22.940 --> 06:24.580
Actually,i do.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.560
Mr.  Baker wants to do
everything for himself.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.600
I feel about as useless
as a mom's college degree.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.310
Sounds like a job for
the problem solvers.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.240
We'll talk to danny for you.

06:39.780 --> 06:41.630
Lemon,i was just going to call you.

06:41.630 --> 06:44.410
The guy who came up with
this thing for arsenio hall

06:44.410 --> 06:48.050
wants to create a signature
arm gesture for our talk show.

06:48.050 --> 06:49.830
I was thinking something like this.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.070
About the talk show...

06:56.070 --> 06:59.390
While i am very thankful for your offer,

06:59.390 --> 07:03.900
i think i maybe should take a couple other
meetings before committing to anything.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.450
Like you said,i'm a commodity now.

07:06.450 --> 07:09.410
My book is number 14 on the
nonfiction bestseller chart,

07:09.410 --> 07:12.400
right behind the founding fathers' diet.

07:12.400 --> 07:17.480
So...  I'm signing with an
agent and exploring my options.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.190
I see.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.750
Well,if that's how you feel about it.

07:23.050 --> 07:24.840
Good luck in the marketplace.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.890
Obviously,this is nothing personal.

07:26.890 --> 07:28.590
I just want to be thorough.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.140
That's okay,right?

07:31.510 --> 07:34.090
All right,then.  Great meeting.

07:34.090 --> 07:37.050
Raise your hand if you're
cool with what's happening.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.410
Not too late to raise your hand.

07:48.460 --> 07:51.410
Cerie,if you need me,i'll be
at a meeting with my new agent.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.970
Oh,he called to confirm your lunch,

07:52.970 --> 07:55.280
but i told him you'd
already eaten a weird panini.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.590
That was no.

07:56.590 --> 07:59.250
Just,heh,call him and
tell him i'm on my way.

07:59.250 --> 08:02.840
- Do i look okay? 
- That's exactly how you look.

08:07.790 --> 08:13.690
There she is! The
dealbreaker! Simon barrons.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.570
- You're an agent? 
- Uh,junior agent.

08:17.020 --> 08:19.790
Um,uh,full disclosure: until
now,i've mainly represented dogs,

08:19.790 --> 08:23.090
but seeing as how we're both embarking
on a new phase in our career performing,

08:23.090 --> 08:26.730
representing humans and monkeys i
want you to know that i'm hungry.

08:26.730 --> 08:28.220
And i would do anything for you.

08:28.220 --> 08:30.540
My clients are more important
to me than my own mommy.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.980
Okay,good.  I need someone
that i can count on.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.980
I'm...  Kind of alone out
here in the marketplace.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.090
I get it,i get it. 
That's what i'm here for.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.980
Um,okay,let's get your face
out there,take some meetings.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.470
There's jack donahee at nbc.

08:43.470 --> 08:45.520
Donaghy.  Already met.  Who else?

08:45.520 --> 08:47.190
Do you know who scottie shofar is?

08:47.190 --> 08:50.550
Oh,yeah,he's the guy that produces   THAT
DUMB SPORTS SHOW THAT ALWAYS BEATS US.

08:50.550 --> 08:52.140
Yeah,you're talking
about sports shouting.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.280
- Okay,let's meet with him. 
- Absolutely.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.840
Now,i don't know him,

09:01.840 --> 09:05.380
but a former client of mine once
buried a bone in his backyard.

09:05.380 --> 09:06.550
We go looking for that bone,

09:06.550 --> 09:08.750
it's like,"oh,mr.Shofar,what's up?

09:08.750 --> 09:11.550
My client has got an
idea for a talk show.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.450
" oh,no,i got the hiccups.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.380
Danny,around here,we're
known as the problem solvers.

09:20.380 --> 09:22.520
Always have been,always will be.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.610
And we think you could
use a little guidance.

09:24.610 --> 09:25.650
Yes,please.

09:25.650 --> 09:28.030
I don't even know where the
bathrooms are around here.

09:28.030 --> 09:29.790
It's not about the room,danny.

09:29.790 --> 09:30.900
It's about the man.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.890
Any room you see
around here with a door,

09:33.780 --> 09:35.650
you make it your bathroom.

09:35.650 --> 09:37.840
You're an actor now.  You're special.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.960
And taking advantage of
kenneth is part of it.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.370
It's what he's here for.

09:41.370 --> 09:45.550
Look,i'm just trying to keep my head
down and suppress my canadian accent.

09:45.550 --> 09:50.980
I'm not "aboot" to...
 Aboot...  Abwah...  Out.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.270
Ah,all i'm saying is
that i don't want to

09:54.270 --> 09:56.140
rub anyone the wrong way,even kenneth.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.690
Oh,don't worry.  Kenneth
loves being our slave.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.380
He may say that,but
trust me,it's not true.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.820
I was an assistant once

10:02.820 --> 10:06.340
,and when you're in that position
you grow resentful and bitter.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.710
So what if kenneth's
bitter?  He's an underhuman.

10:08.710 --> 10:12.070
Look,a couple days ago,i was
working as a robot for spare change.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.550
And now look at me.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.740
Kenneth's a page,but who knows?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.630
Someday,he could be running the network.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.840
What?  That's ridiculous.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.370
- Crazier things have happened. 
- Kenneth in charge?

10:25.560 --> 10:27.500
Liz,here are today's press clippings.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.560
Women's health magazine
gave us a dminus.

10:31.350 --> 10:33.290
Son of a bitch!

10:40.870 --> 10:45.040
Sheinhardtuniversal announces
production of a dealbreakers talk show?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.440
What the what,jack?

10:46.440 --> 10:48.150
Let me explain something to you,lemon.

10:48.150 --> 10:50.890
Dealbreakers is a sketch that first
appeared on this networkwe own it.

10:50.890 --> 10:53.440
And we're doing it whether
or not you're involved.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.560
Really?  So you think
you can just replace me?

10:55.560 --> 10:57.000
Of course not.  We can do better.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.760
I've already spoken to padma lakshmi.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.930
Then who's gonna host top chef?

11:00.930 --> 11:02.800
You are ruining my life!

11:02.800 --> 11:04.070
Well,we could just do the show with you.

11:04.070 --> 11:05.340
But that door is closing.

11:05.340 --> 11:06.600
Close it.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.340
You think you can bully me like this?

11:08.340 --> 11:09.340
Well,you don't know me.

11:09.340 --> 11:10.820
Two can play at this game,jack.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.390
Gaah!

11:13.170 --> 11:15.390
Ken,you don't want to be a page forever.

11:15.690 --> 11:17.420
Who said i've been alive forever?

11:17.420 --> 11:22.410
What?  No,i mean...
 What's your dream job?

11:22.420 --> 11:24.730
Where do you see yourself in ten years?

11:24.730 --> 11:26.970
Well,you know how much
i love television,sir.

11:26.970 --> 11:30.960
So i guess my dream would be
to one day run the network.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.880
Just kidding.  There won't be a network.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.580
But whatever people are watching,i
want to be in charge of it.

11:37.580 --> 11:41.050
So...  Someday,you could be my boss?

11:41.050 --> 11:43.470
Well,guess so.

11:44.180 --> 11:46.870
Now,are you ready to get started?

11:46.870 --> 11:49.640
No! I'll brush my own teeth.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.700
I don't want you to have
any resentments towards me.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.970
From now on,i don't want
you to do anything for me.

11:57.860 --> 11:58.860
Hey,jack.

11:58.860 --> 12:01.870
Two days to the show,and i
still don't really know anything.

12:01.870 --> 12:04.070
I'll tell you everything
you need to know,danny.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.620
Never do business with a friend.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.150
Never be friends with a woman.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.350
And lose the leather bracelet.

12:17.180 --> 12:19.010
Pete,i have a problem.
 I need your help.

12:19.010 --> 12:21.360
Oh,my kid got hit by a car!

12:23.210 --> 12:24.920
Hey,jackie d,what's wrong?

12:24.920 --> 12:26.870
You're not your usual,giggly self.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.440
If you've got a problem,you've
found the right people.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.700
Okay,i have a problem.

12:32.030 --> 12:34.660
It needs to be communicated to lemon
that if she wants to play business,

12:34.660 --> 12:36.100
i'm more than happy to play with her.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.280
But as she saw earlier today,business
jack does not play gentle.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.010
Are you as turned on as i am right now?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.900
Lemon has a decision to make. 
She can either be crushed by me.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.240
Or she can suck in her stomach

12:46.240 --> 12:49.750
and crawl back through the tiny crack
i've left for her in the proverbial door.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.900
You think you can pass that along?

12:57.270 --> 13:00.170
Wait,hang on...  Our tshirts are wrong.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.490
Do you want to switch where we're
standing,or switch our tshirts?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.620
Just to be safe,let's do both.

13:05.430 --> 13:07.970
Really?  He said crawl back?

13:07.970 --> 13:11.240
You're not really capturing
the sexual energy of it,

13:11.240 --> 13:12.540
but that was the message.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.130
So problem solved?

13:14.130 --> 13:16.810
I haven't even begun to problem.

13:16.810 --> 13:21.570
We are suing jack donaghy and nbc
for the rights to dealbreakers.

13:28.790 --> 13:30.540
Would either of you care for a drink?

13:30.540 --> 13:32.650
- No. 
- Do you have drinkable yogurt?

13:33.140 --> 13:35.230
Simon,we're both men of the world.

13:35.230 --> 13:37.560
Yeah,i've seen some bras.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.610
I bet you have.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.700
Here's the thing. 
No one's suing anyone.

13:41.700 --> 13:42.910
Don't let him push you around.

13:42.910 --> 13:44.540
I'm not.  God,leave me alone.

13:44.540 --> 13:47.240
Nbc employs 80% of
your agency's clients,

13:47.240 --> 13:48.930
between are you stronger than a dog

13:48.930 --> 13:52.100
and i'm a celebrity dog: get
me out arf here.  You need us.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.570
I've already talked to your lawyers,and
they're not interested in pursuing this.

13:55.570 --> 13:58.880
God,jack,why are you being
such a wang about this?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.160
I'll take that as a complement.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.830
An wang,the founder of wang computers,

14:01.830 --> 14:04.200
is one of the greatest
businessmen of the 20th century.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.870
And you're the one being
a lowercase wang,lemon,

14:06.870 --> 14:10.230
because after working with
me every day for four years,

14:10.230 --> 14:12.010
you didn't trust me
to produce your show.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.410
Instead,you made it about business.

14:14.730 --> 14:20.310
And i didn't get a bathroom door that looks
like part of a wall by being bad at business.

14:20.310 --> 14:21.340
That's a bathroom?

14:21.340 --> 14:24.230
You tried to take advantage of
our friendship to make money.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.150
I don't need you to make money.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.740
In fact,i'm meeting with
your replacement tonight.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.730
Yeah?  Well,i'm replacing you too.

14:30.730 --> 14:33.780
Because i got all kinds
of meetings lined up.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.740
- Big meetings. 
- Really?  With who?

14:35.740 --> 14:37.340
Damn it,simon!

14:43.810 --> 14:45.050
You were right about jack.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.170
He's in love with me?

14:46.170 --> 14:49.090
What?  No.  He burned
me on dealbreakers.

14:49.090 --> 14:51.520
And now i need to find someone
to help me burn him back.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.290
Well,i could introduce you
to my boy,scottie shofar.

14:54.290 --> 14:54.990
You know him?

14:54.990 --> 14:57.830
Hell,yeah! I'm a frequent
guest on sports shouting.

15:01.630 --> 15:06.100
Nah,introducing you to scottie probably
wouldn't solve your problems with jack.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.190
Jack who?  Set it up.

15:08.190 --> 15:11.100
Scottie shofar.  I know that name.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.470
- What does he look like? 
- I don't know.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.540
All white people look
the same to me,pete.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.120
Oh,my god.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.680
Scottie shofar was my assistant
on trivial pursuit: the movie.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.210
I was horrible to him.

15:21.210 --> 15:23.100
And now he's actually successful?

15:23.100 --> 15:25.900
What if i got called in to audition
for him and he recognized me,

15:25.900 --> 15:27.660
even with all the changes to my face?

15:27.990 --> 15:29.110
That have happened naturally.

15:29.110 --> 15:30.740
That's what danny was saying.

15:30.740 --> 15:32.510
We have to be cool to everybody.

15:32.510 --> 15:35.340
Because the future is
like a japanese game show

15:35.340 --> 15:37.750
you have no idea what's going on.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.830
Miss maroney,your
mexican diet pills came.

15:39.830 --> 15:42.040
Should i start taking them
to test their side effects?

15:42.040 --> 15:44.600
No,kenneth.  I'll do it myself.

15:44.600 --> 15:48.350
You don't have to do anything
for me anymore.  Ever.

15:50.690 --> 15:52.850
What is happening around here?

15:52.850 --> 15:55.330
What has changed?

16:00.470 --> 16:02.260
We're aboot to get married.

16:02.530 --> 16:05.940
Oh,no,that's not right.  Abhah.  Obot.

16:05.940 --> 16:07.790
Mr.  Baker.  We need to talk.

16:07.790 --> 16:10.040
Now's not a great time,kenneth.
 I don't need anything.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.910
Sir,this time,i need something from you.

16:12.910 --> 16:16.000
You've poisoned mr.  Jordan's
and miss maroney's minds.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.230
You've got to tell them to
go back to the way it was.

16:19.230 --> 16:22.310
To let me help everyone
again.  Including you.

16:22.310 --> 16:25.550
- Kenneth,i don't. 
- yes,you do.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.600
Because you're scared.  And frustrated.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.130
Of course i am,because
i'm going on tv tomorrow

16:30.130 --> 16:31.750
and i don't know what i'm doing.

16:32.770 --> 16:34.810
- Embrace your anger. 
- What?

16:35.070 --> 16:37.700
Yyou know,of all the
weirdos i've met around here,

16:37.700 --> 16:41.380
you're the worst! With
your creepy,don knotts face,

16:41.380 --> 16:43.530
that ridiculous hitler youth haircut.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.460
Excellent.  What about my chin?

16:45.460 --> 16:46.540
What about your chin,kenneth?

16:46.540 --> 16:48.340
I've seen bigger chins
on a premature baby!

16:48.340 --> 16:51.230
MR.Baker,you've just
made me feel terrible.

16:51.230 --> 16:54.040
And said the word "about" correctly.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.830
Congratulations.  You're an actor.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.220
- About. 
- About.

17:00.540 --> 17:04.609
Oh,my god.  Thank you,kenneth.

17:04.609 --> 17:07.380
That was aboot the coolest
thing i've ever seen.

17:07.380 --> 17:08.800
How long have you been there?

17:08.800 --> 17:10.160
- Nine hours. 
- A few minutes.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.319
Well,you need to know something too.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.140
No matter what happens in the future,

17:14.140 --> 17:16.400
i will always take care of you.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.869
Kenneth's the best.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.930
He knows what i want before i do.

17:19.930 --> 17:23.540
- Who's hungry? 
- I wanted waffles.

17:26.790 --> 17:30.600
So you can have all the powers
of superman for an entire year,but

17:30.600 --> 17:33.660
superman? I've done hot yoga
with tom welling and dean cain,

17:33.660 --> 17:35.130
and i don't think
they're right for this.

17:35.130 --> 17:37.750
No,i wasn't,um sorry,i gotta take this.

17:37.750 --> 17:41.680
What's up?  Nothin',just meeting
with this dealbreakers lady.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.180
I don't know. 
Regular,six.  Drunk,seven.

17:47.100 --> 17:51.900
Padma,i'm so happy you've taken
an interest in dealbreakers.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.730
I love doing top chef,

17:53.730 --> 17:57.370
but this would give me a chance
to showcase my other talents.

17:57.370 --> 18:00.410
I mean,men always
tell me i'm very funny.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.210
Have you heard this one?  Knockknock.

18:05.310 --> 18:08.040
We don't even care about the
profits from your actual show.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.190
That's nothing to us. 
That's our snapple money.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.440
See,we're all about
monetizing you as a brand.

18:14.530 --> 18:15.970
I'm blowing up.  It's rahm emanuel.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.750
He wants me to go to deer
valley.  I am crushing it!

18:18.750 --> 18:21.480
Yeah,because i'm really
looking for a partner in this.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.880
Someone i can trust.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.340
So...  I would be a full
partner in this with you?

18:26.340 --> 18:27.780
That's what i'm looking for,yes.

18:27.780 --> 18:31.080
I like it.  You know,i'm
very entrepreneurial.

18:31.080 --> 18:35.790
I invented this new bag that you put
around a sandwich to keep it fresh.

18:35.790 --> 18:40.220
But it's clear,so you still get
the full visual of the sandwich.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.550
So it's a sandwich bag?

18:41.550 --> 18:45.170
No,jack,it's a new
thing that i invented.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.660
The point is,we do business together,

18:47.660 --> 18:49.780
and you are my number one priority.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.060
Nothing is more
important to me than you.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.840
I gotta take this.  It's brooke hogan.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.790
What's up,you tall drink
of bitch! You're amazing.

18:57.790 --> 19:00.510
No,seriously.  Amazing.

19:02.270 --> 19:05.070
Yeah,you heard me.  Yeah,that's right.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.810
Yeah.  No,seriously.

19:09.810 --> 19:12.410
So what would my time commitment
be if i host this thing?

19:12.620 --> 19:14.090
Honestly,two days a week.

19:14.090 --> 19:15.930
Wow,that's great.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.710
Top chef has all this
traveling and allday shoots.

19:18.710 --> 19:22.780
If i could do this instead,i wouldn't
be so grouchy and exhausted all the time.

19:22.780 --> 19:25.310
My clothes wouldn't have
food stains all over them.

19:25.310 --> 19:31.770
I could actually find a balance
between my work and being a mommy.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.560
This would change my life,jack.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.710
It would.  It would change your life.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.100
- So let's do this. 
- No.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.120
- What? 
- I don't want to change your life.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.350
I want to change
lemon's life.  I'm sorry.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.950
Uhh,this business is so hard!

19:49.180 --> 19:51.140
Not really.I'm kidding.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.650
Go.  Go.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.880
- Lemon. 
- Jack.

20:19.880 --> 20:24.240
I was wrong.  It's you.
 It's always been you.

20:25.270 --> 20:27.510
I want to do business with you,lemon.

20:27.510 --> 20:29.660
I'd like that.

do you have a problem?

20:39.070 --> 20:42.500
then call the problem solvers.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.470
Taxes got you down? 
Wasps in your crawlspace?

20:45.470 --> 20:48.320
Term paper blues?  Migrating implants?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.140
call the problem solvers.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.900
'Cause after all,what's a
problem but an opportunity

20:52.900 --> 20:55.750
disguisedas a stripper

20:55.750 --> 20:56.840
Mouse in your house?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.730
Or need a cheap flight to tucson?

20:58.730 --> 21:02.960
Both: ?we are the problem...??solvers ?

21:02.960 --> 21:05.620
that was a good rehearsal.
 Now let's record it.
