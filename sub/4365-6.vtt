WEBVTT

00:01.384 --> 00:02.752
I lost Ava her company.

00:02.753 --> 00:05.100
I assume my deal
with Edward is dead.

00:05.321 --> 00:06.971
As long as you win
her murder trial,

00:07.023 --> 00:09.107
you'll be
the next managing partner.

00:09.158 --> 00:10.642
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

00:10.693 --> 00:12.644
I can see that.

00:12.695 --> 00:14.479
So you're not upset?

00:14.530 --> 00:16.865
No.

00:16.949 --> 00:18.483
I got an interview.

00:18.534 --> 00:19.651
Look, I'm sorry, I just didn't
know how to tell you, Mike.

00:19.702 --> 00:21.002
I don't know,
how about,

00:21.087 --> 00:22.788
"hey, Mike, I might go
to law school 3,000 miles away"?

00:22.839 --> 00:26.425
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

00:26.492 --> 00:29.344
This is about me getting
personal with Donna.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.162
Chain of custody is something
I know a little bit about,

00:31.214 --> 00:32.214
thanks to you.

00:32.298 --> 00:33.348
Save yourself
the embarrassment

00:33.433 --> 00:34.666
and cancel this trial.

00:34.717 --> 00:36.601
We're in the ring,
I'm still standing,

00:36.669 --> 00:37.969
and this isn't done.

00:38.020 --> 00:39.838
It's going up
on the wall tomorrow.

00:39.889 --> 00:42.006
And this is your way
of getting me on your side?

00:42.058 --> 00:44.309
I don't want you
on my side.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.478
I want us to be
on the same side.

00:51.951 --> 00:54.703
- You look happy.
- Do I?

00:54.787 --> 00:56.705
Why?

00:56.789 --> 01:00.375
Um, I don't know, Donna,
it's hard to explain.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.743
All right,
I'll tell you.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.468
Mikado finally slept
in my bed last night,

01:03.496 --> 01:04.736
and when I woke up
this morning,

01:04.747 --> 01:06.047
it felt like the whole world
was hugging me.

01:06.132 --> 01:07.699
I lost 9 ounces.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.084
My teeth whiteners
are working.

01:09.168 --> 01:11.002
I found five new hairs
on the top of my head.

01:11.053 --> 01:12.671
And to top it all off,
I just found out

01:12.722 --> 01:15.206
that Esther broke her foot
in three places.

01:15.258 --> 01:16.224
Your sister?

01:16.309 --> 01:17.709
Yeah, crutches
for seven months.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.212
Serves her right.
Dad's favorite.

01:25.651 --> 01:27.719
Mm.

01:30.523 --> 01:32.908
I need a day.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.568 --> 01:44.035
Dom Perignon's on ice

01:44.086 --> 01:45.454
and Bloomberg's
closing Broadway

01:45.538 --> 01:46.905
for the ticker-tape parade.

01:46.956 --> 01:48.757
You saw the sign?

01:48.841 --> 01:50.592
Yeah, dream come true
for any lawyer.

01:50.676 --> 01:52.911
I don't have dreams.
I have goals.

01:52.962 --> 01:55.914
Now it's on
to the next one.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.471
When did you find out?

02:02.555 --> 02:03.555
Last night.

02:03.606 --> 02:04.973
Why didn't you tell me?

02:05.057 --> 02:06.691
I shouldn't have to.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.109
Meaning?

02:08.193 --> 02:10.812
Meaning your focus hasn't
been where it usually is.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.777
Okay, meaning that my focus
has been on Stephen.

02:12.815 --> 02:15.534
If that's what you mean,
then just say it.

02:15.601 --> 02:16.768
Just admit that it bothers you
about me and him.

02:16.819 --> 02:18.269
I'm not admitting anything

02:18.321 --> 02:19.871
because there's nothing
to admit.

02:19.939 --> 02:22.290
And Stephen or not,
you know as well as I do

02:22.375 --> 02:23.792
I've never had
to tell you a thing.

02:23.876 --> 02:26.211
You've always just known.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.799
- You've had too much coffee.
- What are you talking about?

02:30.883 --> 02:32.167
After two cups,
your signature slants.

02:32.251 --> 02:33.301
After three,
it scrawls.

02:33.386 --> 02:34.886
And after four,
it's chicken scratch.

02:34.954 --> 02:36.154
They're not gonna
accept these.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.222
You're crazy.

02:37.289 --> 02:38.139
How many cups
have you had today?

02:38.224 --> 02:39.958
Five.

02:40.009 --> 02:41.793
How'd you do that?

02:41.844 --> 02:43.144
It's what I do.

02:43.229 --> 02:46.631
I read, I analyze, I fix.

02:46.682 --> 02:48.934
Bullshit.

02:50.686 --> 02:51.820
You're wearing
a blue shirt,

02:51.904 --> 02:53.488
which means you won big
in poker last night.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.940
You missed a spot shaving,

02:54.991 --> 02:56.775
which means you had
less than five hours of sleep.

02:56.826 --> 02:58.109
And your left wrist,

02:58.160 --> 03:01.279
which you claim you sprained
playing basketball,

03:01.330 --> 03:02.998
still hasn't healed
because your loud tie is hanging

03:03.082 --> 03:05.367
ever so slightly
to the left.

03:05.451 --> 03:08.119
Loud, by the way, because
you won big in poker last night.

03:08.170 --> 03:09.337
For your information,

03:09.422 --> 03:11.322
I didn't lose sleep
just because of poker.

03:11.374 --> 03:13.658
Yeah, you did.

03:13.709 --> 03:14.876
Melanie's not
in the picture anymore.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.845
- You knew about Melanie?
- And Charlotte.

03:16.929 --> 03:18.630
And Nadia.

03:18.681 --> 03:20.599
Okay, I don't want you
working for me anymore.

03:20.666 --> 03:22.834
Harvey, stop playing
footsie with your secretary.

03:22.885 --> 03:24.436
Mackenzie brothers
are here.

03:24.503 --> 03:26.221
We need to get
these assholes to cave.

03:26.305 --> 03:29.340
I had an idea.
Nite owl murders.

03:29.392 --> 03:31.476
We're not using an idea
you got from <i>L.A. Confidential.</i>

03:31.527 --> 03:33.562
How is that different
from you shooting a dead guy

03:33.646 --> 03:35.730
just because Sean Connery
did it in <i>The Untouchables?</i>

03:35.815 --> 03:37.682
What are you prepared to do?

03:37.733 --> 03:39.618
Is that supposed
to be Sean Connery?

03:39.685 --> 03:42.487
Don't even think that you
can do Connery better than me.

03:42.538 --> 03:45.323
Junior.

03:45.374 --> 03:46.708
He's a lying member

03:46.792 --> 03:48.710
of a no-good race.

03:48.794 --> 03:50.579
Ease up, James Bond.

03:50.663 --> 03:51.830
So you gonna come out
and say it?

03:51.881 --> 03:52.831
Say what?

03:52.882 --> 03:55.250
All those observations.

03:55.334 --> 03:57.252
You're into me.

03:59.088 --> 04:01.006
I'm not into you.
I'm Donna.

04:01.057 --> 04:02.340
What's that
supposed to mean?

04:02.391 --> 04:03.258
It means I could do
the same thing with Bertha

04:03.342 --> 04:04.542
that I did with you.

04:04.594 --> 04:06.428
All that means is that
you're into Bertha too.

04:06.512 --> 04:07.596
Ooh, what if I am?

04:07.680 --> 04:09.380
We can have
a threesome.

04:09.432 --> 04:12.183
Trust me, if you were ever
lucky enough to have me,

04:12.234 --> 04:15.186
you wouldn't want to share.

04:22.945 --> 04:24.946
Dude, you gonna share
that shit with me or what?

04:25.031 --> 04:26.615
Negatory.

04:26.699 --> 04:27.949
Mmhmm.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.784
All right, you can have some,
but take it easy.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.419
It's gotta last
until tomorrow.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.071
I thought you had
3 ounces.

04:33.122 --> 04:35.740
I sold it.
Daddy's gotta eat.

04:35.791 --> 04:36.758
Wait a minute,
you're dealing now?

04:36.842 --> 04:37.959
Friends and family,
asshole.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.711
What are you, AT&T?

04:39.762 --> 04:41.096
What are you, the FCC?

04:41.180 --> 04:43.264
You don't even know
what that is.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.549
- Yes, I do.
- Really?

04:44.600 --> 04:47.552
Tell me what they do.
I'll give you $500.

04:47.603 --> 04:48.937
You're a dick.

04:49.021 --> 04:50.772
A dick who just got
a hundred on his Calc midterm.

04:50.856 --> 04:52.941
You got the results back
already?

04:53.025 --> 04:54.392
No, but trust me,
hundred.

04:54.443 --> 04:55.894
You know who else
thinks you're a dick?

04:55.945 --> 04:57.261
That math test.

04:57.313 --> 04:58.930
Well, that's fine,
because I just made it my bitch.

04:58.981 --> 05:02.100
Up top, mother flecker!

05:02.151 --> 05:03.818
Whoa, you're gonna
leave me hanging?

05:03.903 --> 05:07.906
Like you're gonna
leave me hanging?

05:07.957 --> 05:10.041
You got into Harvard,
dickhead.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.080
They accepted
my transfer?

05:15.131 --> 05:16.581
Yeah, they did.

05:16.632 --> 05:18.416
Holy goddamn shit.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.469
Wait a minute,
you read my mail?

05:21.554 --> 05:22.671
What's the point
of going through it

05:22.755 --> 05:24.472
if I'm not gonna read it?
I hate you.

05:24.557 --> 05:27.458
Yeah, mother flecker!

05:27.510 --> 05:28.927
Holy shit, dude.

05:28.978 --> 05:32.013
We gotta celebrate.
Yeah.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.265
Those douche bags over
at A.E. Pi are having a party.

05:34.316 --> 05:35.299
It's on.

05:35.351 --> 05:36.735
It's still on.

05:36.802 --> 05:38.019
There's a reason Cameron
hasn't raised the white flag

05:38.104 --> 05:39.270
with Ava yet.

05:39.321 --> 05:40.572
What is it?

05:40.639 --> 05:42.306
I was filing our motion
to dismiss

05:42.358 --> 05:44.109
when I noticed his office
faxed the court

05:44.160 --> 05:45.326
from the Waldorf Astoria.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.495
He's been booking rooms
all over Manhattan.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.114
And turns out
two days ago,

05:49.165 --> 05:50.749
he also called in
the U.S. Marshals.

05:50.816 --> 05:52.167
Protective custody.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.753
- 20 men strong.
- Shit.

05:54.820 --> 05:55.987
This case isn't over.

05:56.038 --> 05:58.356
He's got
another goddamn witness.

06:33.161 --> 06:34.663
Rachel, come on,
let's just sit down,

06:34.664 --> 06:36.461
for ten minutes, please.
This is ridiculous.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.771
I can't.
I don't wanna miss my flight.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.822
You're not gonna
miss your flight.

06:38.907 --> 06:40.440
It doesn't leave
for another three hours.

06:40.491 --> 06:41.825
And you're supposed
to be there two hours before,

06:41.910 --> 06:43.143
and the airport's
an hour away.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.528
And you know what, instead
of giving me a hard time

06:44.612 --> 06:46.313
about my travel habits,

06:46.364 --> 06:48.615
it'd be nice if you'd just
come with me to the airport.

06:48.666 --> 06:50.317
Rachel, you know the case
I'm working on,

06:50.368 --> 06:52.502
you know the deadline,
and you know the stakes.

06:52.587 --> 06:53.987
What I know is you don't
want me to visit Stanford

06:54.038 --> 06:55.672
because you don't want me
to go to Stanford.

06:55.757 --> 06:57.507
I never said that.

06:57.592 --> 06:59.176
I just said I wish you had
told me that you had applied.

06:59.260 --> 07:01.044
Well, I did,
and now you're being shitty

07:01.129 --> 07:02.369
because you don't
want me to go,

07:02.380 --> 07:03.714
and you won't even
just admit it.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.165
Look, do you really want this
to be easy for me?

07:05.216 --> 07:07.134
All I wanted is for you
to tell me

07:07.185 --> 07:10.170
to have a good trip
and to mean it.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.946
Have a good trip.

07:30.875 --> 07:33.460
Okay, you're telling me
that if I can guess

07:33.527 --> 07:38.165
your exact birthday,
you will kiss me right here.

07:38.216 --> 07:41.385
If you can guess
my birthday,

07:41.469 --> 07:42.669
I'll kiss you...

07:43.921 --> 07:46.206
Wow.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.308
That is very detailed.

07:48.376 --> 07:50.510
All right,
I'm ready to get started.

07:50.561 --> 07:52.095
Uh, I need 360--

07:52.180 --> 07:53.781
I'm sorry, I gotta borrow
my friend here.

07:53.815 --> 07:55.349
I need to borrow my friend
just for a second.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.716
No, no, Trevor, 'cause we're
right in the middle of a thing.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.268
I'm doing the birthday thing.
What are you doing?

07:58.353 --> 08:00.073
I just found out
behind that door over there

08:00.154 --> 08:02.722
is a poker game filled
with drunk A.E. Pi brothers.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.241
No way!
Yeah, that's a great idea.

08:04.325 --> 08:06.393
I should totally not pursue
this hot girl.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.828
Dude, whatever,
you're always telling me

08:07.895 --> 08:08.912
you're Mr. <i>rounders.</i>

08:08.997 --> 08:10.080
Let's go take
their money.

08:10.164 --> 08:11.231
Come on,
we're here to drink booze

08:11.282 --> 08:12.565
and hit on chicks,

08:12.617 --> 08:14.868
not sit in the dark
and play with a bunch of dudes.

08:14.919 --> 08:17.954
Come on, now where was--

08:18.039 --> 08:19.122
what?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.590
Totally not cool, man.

08:20.675 --> 08:22.759
- Of her or of you?
- Whatever.

08:22.844 --> 08:25.245
Whoa, hey, excuse me.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.214
Our house, our rules,
asshole.

08:27.265 --> 08:28.465
Oh!

08:28.549 --> 08:29.716
Douche bag.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.101
Man, forget him.

08:31.185 --> 08:32.969
Nah, I can't.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.422
First week freshman year,
I was playing basketball.

08:35.472 --> 08:36.423
He showed up with three
of his buddies.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.191
I go up for a lay-up,

08:38.259 --> 08:40.527
he comes in,
lays me out.

08:40.594 --> 08:41.945
Stands over me and says,

08:42.030 --> 08:44.431
"What are you gonna
do about it?"

08:44.482 --> 08:47.267
I let it go.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.769
I'm not letting it go
this time.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.238
Let's roll.

08:53.074 --> 08:53.990
You wanted to see me?

08:54.075 --> 08:57.244
Mackenzie brothers.

08:58.546 --> 09:00.280
I got 'em 25 years apiece.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.614
You?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.450
You wouldn't have gotten shit
without me.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.669
Nite owl murders, baby.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.137
Oh, don't do that.

09:07.221 --> 09:09.473
What kind of person doesn't
high-five another person?

09:09.557 --> 09:11.174
A person
who's not ten years old.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.126
Oh, so you mean
like a dick.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.096
No, I mean, like the guy
that can fire you on the spot.

09:16.147 --> 09:19.015
Nite owl murders, baby.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.901
All right, okay, okay.

09:20.968 --> 09:24.471
All kidding aside,
great job.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.689
Thank you.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.690
That's not
why I called you down here.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.142
Look, Harvey,

09:29.193 --> 09:31.078
you're killing it,
and you've been killing it,

09:31.145 --> 09:32.812
and I think it's time
that you got rewarded for it.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.414
Head litigator.

09:34.482 --> 09:37.200
Look, I know you got a deal
with Jessica to come back,

09:37.285 --> 09:39.286
but I'm telling you,
in ten years, you could be me.

09:39.337 --> 09:41.371
You think about it.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.791
In the meantime,
celebrate the win.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.515
Just stay away
from my scotch.

09:53.167 --> 09:54.935
Well, I guess
I win again.

09:55.002 --> 09:57.521
You guys are really
behind the times.

09:57.605 --> 09:59.005
You ought to be playing
hold'em.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.507
Don't give a shit
about moneymaker

10:00.558 --> 10:01.808
and his bullshit game.

10:01.859 --> 10:03.310
We're old school.
We play stud.

10:03.361 --> 10:04.677
You lose at stud.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.696
Not to you, asshole.

10:06.781 --> 10:09.983
No, no, no, no,
you lose to me.

10:10.034 --> 10:13.036
Come on, hurry up, old school.
Deal the cards.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.525
Compliments
of Cameron Dennis.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.664
Harvey, this isn't
just winning a case.

10:24.715 --> 10:26.550
This is head litigator.

10:26.634 --> 10:27.801
Scotch isn't good enough.

10:27.868 --> 10:29.702
We need, like, a ritual
or something.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.505
What did you have in mind?

10:31.556 --> 10:33.673
I don't know.

10:33.724 --> 10:34.891
I have an idea.

10:34.976 --> 10:36.676
I'm listening.

10:36.727 --> 10:38.727
It's not something
a gentleman should say out loud.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.148
Oh, well,
then I'm willing to pretend

10:41.215 --> 10:43.683
that you're a gentleman.

10:46.571 --> 10:50.574
Okay, you are definitely
not a gentleman.

10:50.658 --> 10:52.943
What would we even
do it with?

10:53.027 --> 10:54.394
Whipped cream.

10:56.330 --> 10:57.897
Enough about
this conversation.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.783
I want to revisit
our earlier one.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.786
This is our earlier one.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.539
Come on, you know
you've thought about it.

11:05.590 --> 11:07.407
Yeah, I think
about a lot of things.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.543
And you would.

11:09.594 --> 11:12.012
But I won't.

11:12.079 --> 11:13.580
You're afraid
you'd fall for me.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.391
Oh, please, if anybody's
falling for anybody,

11:15.433 --> 11:16.933
it would be you for me.

11:17.018 --> 11:18.935
Sounds like a challenge.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.604
One you are never
gonna get to take.

11:20.688 --> 11:22.305
Why not?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.641
'Cause I don't get involved
with men that I work with.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.309
Okay, then you're fired.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.760
'Bout time.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.229
What did I ever
do to you?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.731
Nothing.
I get your chair.

11:31.782 --> 11:33.533
Bertha, what are you
doing here so late?

11:33.601 --> 11:34.818
Don't get all up
in my business

11:34.902 --> 11:37.153
just because I interrupted you
hitting on red.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.905
How do you know
I'm hitting on her?

11:38.956 --> 11:41.157
Two glasses of scotch
and you.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.994
I found a Mackenzie file
in the MacAllister box.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.579
You're welcome.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.048
And you better get
Dennis his scotch back.

11:48.115 --> 11:50.634
He won't like that.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.118
Shit.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.336
What's wrong?

11:53.421 --> 11:55.505
We left out
a piece of discovery.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.590
Will it screw us?

11:56.641 --> 11:58.958
It just did.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.961
Well, I raise.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.396
500.

12:07.801 --> 12:09.686
Call and raise
another 500.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.189
I don't have
another 500, so...

12:13.274 --> 12:15.692
Wait a second.
He might.

12:17.078 --> 12:18.811
I have another thousand
on me.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.196
How do you have
another thousand?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.314
From the weed.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.166
I told you,
I got rid of it.

12:23.251 --> 12:26.920
Now do you have this guy
or not?

12:26.987 --> 12:28.371
I got kings full of 2s.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.040
He's got no aces showing,

12:30.124 --> 12:32.825
and <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>
folded one on first street.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.993
The only way he beats me

12:34.045 --> 12:35.662
is with trip 3s or trip 4s
under there,

12:35.713 --> 12:37.464
and Limp Bizkit
folded two 3s,

12:37.515 --> 12:40.050
and Dickcheese over here
had a 4.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.519
So he's got a...

12:42.603 --> 12:43.853
- A straight.
- Straight.

12:43.938 --> 12:44.888
Or he's bluffing,

12:44.972 --> 12:46.139
but either way,
I got him.

12:46.190 --> 12:47.474
Hey, do you always get
your girlfriend's advice

12:47.525 --> 12:48.725
on everything?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.677
Oh, this guy.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.196
Well, let's raise
another 500.

12:53.281 --> 12:54.481
Hmm.

12:54.532 --> 12:57.067
Don't ask for more
unless you wanna lose it.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.192
Call.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.662
Full house.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.416
Four 4s, asshole.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.085
Whoa, wait.
Wait, that's not possible.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.202
He had--

13:16.253 --> 13:18.138
he's cheating.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.676
And what are you
gonna do about it?

13:22.727 --> 13:24.877
You're not gonna get away
with this.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.546
Well, I guess
your only option

13:26.597 --> 13:28.765
would be
to call the police.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.210
Of course,
I haven't been drinking,

13:30.217 --> 13:32.352
'cause, you know,
I'm underage, like you boys.

13:32.403 --> 13:33.353
You set us up.

13:33.404 --> 13:35.522
Yeah.

13:35.573 --> 13:37.190
See, I remember you.

13:37.241 --> 13:38.742
First week,
you come into class,

13:38.826 --> 13:40.893
Mr. "Oh, I got
the whole textbook memorized."

13:40.945 --> 13:42.529
Made the rest of us
look like chumps.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.280
No, you did that
all by yourself.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.665
Yeah, well,
I don't need a super brain

13:45.733 --> 13:47.283
to remember some guy who thinks
his shit don't stink.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.284
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.
- Hey, back up.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.502
Now get the hell outta here

13:49.570 --> 13:52.255
before we put you
out of here.

14:04.029 --> 14:05.378
Congratulations Harvey.

14:05.673 --> 14:07.468
I had no idea
Jessica was planning this.

14:07.629 --> 14:08.946
What do you want, Stephen?

14:09.098 --> 14:11.232
I hear Cameron
got a witness.

14:11.316 --> 14:13.768
He did.
What do you want?

14:13.852 --> 14:15.019
I'm just checking to see

14:15.070 --> 14:16.270
if there's anything
I can do to help.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.722
There isn't.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.576
Cheers.

14:23.328 --> 14:24.362
What do you got?

14:24.429 --> 14:25.446
I couldn't find out

14:25.531 --> 14:27.081
where Cameron's
got his witness hidden,

14:27.166 --> 14:30.084
but I figured out
who it is.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.071
What?

14:34.123 --> 14:35.840
So now I know
why you wanted to meet me

14:35.907 --> 14:37.875
at the elevator.

14:37.926 --> 14:39.377
Pretty awesome.

14:39.428 --> 14:40.845
Yeah, it is.

14:40.912 --> 14:42.847
What are you gonna do
about Jessica?

14:42.914 --> 14:44.849
I don't know.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.644
Nothing ever changes
around here.

14:56.728 --> 14:59.197
It's good to see you too,
Harvey.

14:59.264 --> 15:02.567
Now what was so important
that you just had to see me?

15:02.618 --> 15:04.768
I wanna talk to you
about extending my time

15:04.820 --> 15:08.322
at the D.A.'s office.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.491
Come with me.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.377
Now what's Cameron Dennis
offering you?

15:13.445 --> 15:16.080
Why does he have
to be offering me something?

15:16.131 --> 15:19.834
Because he knows, if you wanna
keep someone in your house,

15:19.918 --> 15:22.803
offer them
a better room.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.139
Head litigator.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.642
Do you wanna stay there
because it's a step up

15:27.726 --> 15:30.761
or because you can see yourself
there in ten years?

15:30.812 --> 15:32.180
Why do you wanna know?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.599
Because I have a promotion
ready for you right here.

15:34.650 --> 15:36.300
What are you talking about?

15:36.351 --> 15:38.903
Daniel Hardman and I

15:38.970 --> 15:41.989
are taking Gordon, Schmidt,
and Van Dyke down.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.774
That's why we're up here.

15:43.825 --> 15:45.693
Did you think
we were gonna make out?

15:45.777 --> 15:48.079
Man can hope.

15:49.147 --> 15:50.364
What?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.833
Are you sure you wanna
take control in the night?

15:52.918 --> 15:54.835
Nighttime's
when they're sleeping.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.787
Telling them you're coming
shows them respect.

15:56.838 --> 15:59.123
Not telling them
shows them more.

15:59.174 --> 16:00.291
What about honor?

16:00.342 --> 16:03.261
Harvey, we're lawyers.

16:03.328 --> 16:06.514
We're not
in the honor business.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.218
What did I always tell you
when you were here?

16:10.302 --> 16:12.687
Don't judge a man till you've
walked a mile in his shoes.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.939
Well, if you're ever
in these babies,

16:15.006 --> 16:19.610
we'll see if you feel
the same way.

16:24.366 --> 16:25.846
It's a little early
for batting cages,

16:25.850 --> 16:26.867
don't you think?

16:26.952 --> 16:27.985
I'm not going
to the batting cages,

16:28.036 --> 16:29.019
and you know it.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.071
Trevor, let it go.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.706
I can't.
I need that money back.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.190
What did you do?

16:33.242 --> 16:35.626
I haven't paid
for the weed yet.

16:38.196 --> 16:40.364
You took a loan
from a drug dealer?

16:40.415 --> 16:41.699
It's called consignment.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.534
Did you ever learn about
free enterprise in Econ 1a?

16:43.585 --> 16:45.419
No, but I read about
not betting money I don't have

16:45.504 --> 16:46.587
in Econ 1a.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.389
You told me you had him,
smart guy.

16:48.473 --> 16:50.091
I did have him,
and you know I did.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.760
Well, I need
a thousand dollars by Monday,

16:52.844 --> 16:54.512
or Omar's gonna beat
the living shit outta me.

16:54.563 --> 16:56.597
Trevor,
him kicking your ass

16:56.682 --> 16:58.266
doesn't get him
his money any faster.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.550
He's not gonna
see it that way.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.769
Okay, then we will think
of something else.

17:01.853 --> 17:03.321
I've been thinking,

17:03.388 --> 17:05.439
and the only thing
I came up with

17:05.523 --> 17:06.574
you're not gonna like.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.058
Why do I
have to like it?

17:08.109 --> 17:11.695
Because I can't do it.

17:11.747 --> 17:12.747
I told you before,

17:12.830 --> 17:14.699
I'm not selling
any test answers.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.900
It's not any test.
It's the test you just aced.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.453
It's not out there yet.
Nobody has it.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.957
I can make us 1,000 bucks
in one shot.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.291
Tell me you haven't memorized

17:24.376 --> 17:28.378
every question
and every answer, Harvard boy.

17:28.430 --> 17:29.747
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

17:29.798 --> 17:31.766
So what if it is?

17:31.850 --> 17:32.883
Look, you're bolting,

17:32.934 --> 17:34.418
and you're using
your brain to do it.

17:34.469 --> 17:35.586
I'm just asking,

17:35.637 --> 17:38.422
before you go,
use it to help me.

17:39.941 --> 17:42.259
Please.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.734
What the hell is this?

17:49.785 --> 17:51.319
It's the paperwork
for the Mackenzie deal.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.570
Type it up
and get it out.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.538
No, that report was
supposed to be disclosed

17:54.606 --> 17:55.623
during discovery.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.291
If you type up
what I gave you,

17:57.376 --> 17:59.126
you'd know
I'm disclosing it now.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.445
No, you're sticking it
in there now

18:01.496 --> 18:02.830
as if it's always been there.

18:02.914 --> 18:04.632
It's called bluffing.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.334
Okay, it's what I do.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.918
That's how I got the confession
in the first place.

18:07.969 --> 18:10.304
It's called bullshit,
it's what bullshitters do,

18:10.389 --> 18:12.473
and it's how innocent people
sometimes end up in prison.

18:12.557 --> 18:14.225
- Watch yourself.
- Excuse me?

18:14.292 --> 18:16.093
That toxicology report
doesn't change the fact

18:16.144 --> 18:17.812
that those two assholes
killed that woman.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.263
And you being
an asshole to me

18:19.314 --> 18:21.015
doesn't change the fact
that you are breaking the law.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.516
I'm not breaking the law.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.018
I put the goddamn thing
in there.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.020
They can find it
if they can think to look.

18:26.104 --> 18:28.472
Harvey,
you are making a huge--

18:28.523 --> 18:30.641
That's enough!

18:30.692 --> 18:32.526
I'm here.
You're here.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.779
Do your job.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.091
We know you have a witness.

18:47.158 --> 18:48.542
Surprised it took you
that long.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.877
And we know who it is.

18:49.961 --> 18:52.380
The man from the video,
Colonel Mariga.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.997
I don't have any prizes,

18:54.049 --> 18:56.384
so you'll just have to accept
a pat on the back.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.709
That's okay, Tom Selleck,
I don't need a pat on the back.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.240
I just need to know
what bullshit story

19:00.272 --> 19:01.472
he's gonna tell in court.

19:01.523 --> 19:02.640
It's not bullshit.

19:02.691 --> 19:03.891
He's gonna say
that Ava Hessington

19:03.975 --> 19:05.309
paid him to kill
those people.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.560
We're getting access
to him.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.562
No, you're not,
because I'm gonna say

19:08.647 --> 19:10.114
if she finds out
where he is,

19:10.181 --> 19:11.982
what's to stop her
from killing him too?

19:12.033 --> 19:14.351
You're not gonna bribe him,
you're not gonna threaten him,

19:14.403 --> 19:15.820
and you're not gonna
talk him out of it,

19:15.871 --> 19:18.906
because you're not gonna see him
until he gets on the stand.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.825
But what I will do
is allow you

19:20.876 --> 19:22.576
to take an offer
to your client.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.412
15 years, no parole.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.880
You're bluffing.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.581
He's not gonna say she knew
about the murders,

19:27.666 --> 19:29.867
because she didn't.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.552
I'll tell you what.

19:31.636 --> 19:34.755
Ten years with parole.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.340
Ah, make it nine.

19:36.391 --> 19:39.376
After all,
we used to work together.

19:49.090 --> 19:50.937
- How'd it go?
- Don't.

19:51.502 --> 19:52.500
- Was she hot?

19:52.872 --> 19:54.416
I sold her a math test
for $1,000.

19:54.417 --> 19:55.667
I wasn't thinking
of whether she was hot or not.

19:55.752 --> 19:57.318
Okay, I get it,
so, like, an eight?

19:57.370 --> 19:59.154
No, a ten wouldn't even
do her justice.

19:59.205 --> 20:00.756
- So six.
- Mm, she's a four.

20:00.823 --> 20:03.008
But she paid me $1,000,
so I bumped her up to a ten.

20:03.092 --> 20:04.159
Got it.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.178
Thank you, Michael.
Came through.

20:06.262 --> 20:07.679
Not yet.

20:07.764 --> 20:09.181
I'm coming with you
to Omar's.

20:09.265 --> 20:10.532
No, no, no, no,
you can't.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.517
Yes, I can.

20:14.270 --> 20:16.054
What's going on?

20:16.139 --> 20:17.472
I owed him the money
yesterday.

20:17.523 --> 20:19.007
How could you not
tell me that?

20:19.058 --> 20:20.776
Because I couldn't make the
test thing happen until today.

20:20.843 --> 20:22.043
I didn't want you
freaking out.

20:22.061 --> 20:23.445
Well, I'm definitely
coming with you now,

20:23.512 --> 20:26.782
and the only way you can
stop me is with that bat.

20:28.117 --> 20:30.869
You wanted to see me?

20:30.953 --> 20:32.988
What the hell is this?

20:33.039 --> 20:34.706
- It's the Mackenzie file--
- I know what it is.

20:34.791 --> 20:37.025
What the hell did you put
in the fine print?

20:37.076 --> 20:38.493
You too?

20:38.544 --> 20:40.864
You're gonna give me shit about
not disclosing this report?

20:40.880 --> 20:41.997
Not disclosing it?

20:42.048 --> 20:43.999
You gave it to 'em
on a silver platter.

20:44.050 --> 20:46.084
I don't understand.
You want me to take it out?

20:46.169 --> 20:48.053
I don't want you to do shit.
I've already taken it out.

20:48.137 --> 20:49.754
And if I'd wanted it disclosed,

20:49.839 --> 20:51.556
I wouldn't have misfiled it
in the first place.

20:51.641 --> 20:52.674
You buried it?

20:52.725 --> 20:53.892
Damn right I did.

20:53.976 --> 20:56.311
Cameron, look,
I'm all for skirting the law,

20:56.378 --> 20:57.896
but this is
breaking the law.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.181
So was killing that woman,

20:59.232 --> 21:01.049
and I'm not gonna let
those two assholes walk

21:01.100 --> 21:04.052
because our eyewitness had
a few beers at the ball game.

21:04.103 --> 21:05.887
They won't walk. That's why
I put it in the fine print.

21:05.938 --> 21:07.739
You think you're the first guy
to have this idea?

21:07.824 --> 21:09.691
Nobody does it
because it doesn't work.

21:09.742 --> 21:11.193
Well, that's exactly
why it can work.

21:11.244 --> 21:12.828
They won't think
to look at it

21:12.895 --> 21:14.779
because nobody
has the balls to do it.

21:14.864 --> 21:16.397
And what if they do

21:16.449 --> 21:18.750
and these guys get out
and they murder your brother

21:18.835 --> 21:20.118
or your father
or your cousin?

21:20.203 --> 21:21.336
'Cause I'll tell you
right now,

21:21.403 --> 21:23.738
they're gonna
murder someone's.

21:23.789 --> 21:25.423
I don't feel comfortable
with this.

21:25.508 --> 21:27.209
I don't give a shit whether
you feel comfortable or not.

21:27.260 --> 21:28.877
This is my case.
We're not disclosing it.

21:28.928 --> 21:30.345
It's done.
Cameron-

21:30.412 --> 21:32.264
I told you this before.
Don't make me tell you again.

21:32.348 --> 21:33.932
I'm here.
You're here.

21:34.016 --> 21:36.268
Do your job.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.475
- Keep the change.
- I need to speak with you.

21:43.559 --> 21:45.310
Okay, let's talk
on the way up.

21:45.394 --> 21:47.095
No, I prefer
to speak out here.

21:47.146 --> 21:49.614
I know that Cameron's
offered Harvey a deal.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.399
All right, I'm not going
behind Harvey's back.

21:51.450 --> 21:53.068
I don't want you
to go behind his back.

21:53.119 --> 21:54.619
I want you to go
to his face.

21:54.704 --> 21:55.770
And do what?

21:55.821 --> 21:56.938
It wasn't a deal.
It was an insult.

21:56.989 --> 21:58.273
It was an opening.

21:58.324 --> 21:59.491
Now he wouldn't
have offered anything

21:59.575 --> 22:00.909
if he wasn't willing
to negotiate.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.078
Maybe we can get him
down to five years.

22:03.129 --> 22:04.296
That's exactly
what he wants,

22:04.380 --> 22:05.630
to put Ava
in a position

22:05.715 --> 22:07.448
where she has to choose
between five years and life.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.000
That's a better position
than she's in now.

22:09.085 --> 22:10.646
He wouldn't have offered
anything at all

22:10.720 --> 22:11.786
if he wasn't bluffing.

22:11.837 --> 22:13.138
We're not gonna fall
for that bluff.

22:13.222 --> 22:14.662
Well, then Harvey's
making a mistake.

22:14.790 --> 22:16.591
Then take it up
with Harvey.

22:16.658 --> 22:18.793
You know as well as I do
Harvey is not interested

22:18.844 --> 22:20.661
in anything I've got to say
at the moment.

22:20.713 --> 22:22.130
You think Harvey's
making this call

22:22.181 --> 22:23.998
because of what's going on
between you and Donna?

22:24.049 --> 22:26.351
- It's clouding his judgment.
- Not about this.

22:26.435 --> 22:28.002
Right now
Harvey cannot see reason

22:28.053 --> 22:29.304
with respect to Cameron.

22:29.355 --> 22:31.189
He can't hear reason
with respect to me.

22:31.273 --> 22:32.713
Now you have a chance
to convince him

22:32.725 --> 22:33.975
to make a deal, Mike.

22:34.026 --> 22:36.311
Put yourself
in Ava Hessington's shoes.

22:36.362 --> 22:38.947
Would you want that choice
or not?

22:43.702 --> 22:44.852
Okay, whatever happens,

22:44.904 --> 22:47.705
just be quiet
and be cool.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.824
Okay.

22:56.882 --> 22:57.832
Who this?

22:57.883 --> 23:00.034
My friend.

23:00.085 --> 23:02.053
Hi.

23:09.145 --> 23:11.229
Inside.

23:15.651 --> 23:18.937
Don't move.

23:19.021 --> 23:21.556
Where's Omar?

23:21.607 --> 23:22.890
That's Omar.

23:22.942 --> 23:24.392
How is that Omar?

23:24.443 --> 23:26.161
He's obsessed
with <i>The Wire.</i>

23:27.997 --> 23:29.564
Are you kidding me?
Come on.

23:29.615 --> 23:31.249
I'm telling you,
he's no joke.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.093
Yeah, well, I know
I'm supposed to be scared,

23:33.118 --> 23:34.235
but I'm really not.

23:34.286 --> 23:36.337
Don't touch anything.

23:36.405 --> 23:39.924
Now unless my calendar
is messed up,

23:40.009 --> 23:41.259
today be Monday.

23:41.343 --> 23:42.677
- Omar--
- Shut up!

23:42.744 --> 23:44.295
Okay, I'm trying to decide
why I shouldn't call

23:44.380 --> 23:45.964
a couple of hard,
pipe-hitting negroes

23:46.048 --> 23:47.182
to come and work on you

23:47.249 --> 23:49.083
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

23:50.719 --> 23:52.270
I'm--I'm sorry, Omar.

23:52.354 --> 23:53.721
I don't have a reason,

23:53.772 --> 23:56.307
but I think the word
you be looking for

23:56.392 --> 23:58.476
isn't "negro."

23:58.561 --> 23:59.978
If you're gonna quote
<i>Pulp Fiction,</i>

24:00.062 --> 24:01.980
at least have the balls
to quote <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

24:02.064 --> 24:04.816
- Omar--
- Shh, shh, shh.

24:09.038 --> 24:10.488
You know what they call
a quarter pounder with cheese

24:10.573 --> 24:11.573
in France?

24:11.624 --> 24:15.793
A royale with cheese,
mother flecker.

24:15.878 --> 24:18.129
- I love this negro!
- Yeah.

24:18.214 --> 24:19.797
Trevor,
you're off the hook.

24:19.882 --> 24:21.616
Never again.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.968
This be for you.

24:24.053 --> 24:26.554
Not white boy.

24:26.622 --> 24:27.839
Go in peace.

24:27.923 --> 24:29.457
- Oh, uh, okay.
- Thanks.

24:29.508 --> 24:30.925
Hey, thank you.

24:30.976 --> 24:32.060
Mmhmm.

24:32.127 --> 24:33.961
Who touched my alien?

24:35.848 --> 24:37.398
What the hell
is wrong with you?

24:37.466 --> 24:38.986
Come on,
it's nothing that some of this

24:39.068 --> 24:40.985
and a royale with cheese
can't fix.

24:41.070 --> 24:42.604
You do not know
what we just avoided.

24:42.655 --> 24:45.240
Just call me the wolf.
I'll be over there directly.

24:45.307 --> 24:46.908
Oh, you sending the wolf?

24:46.975 --> 24:50.995
Oh, shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.113
Yo, put that away.

24:52.164 --> 24:53.164
What?
Put what away?

24:53.249 --> 24:54.832
If they find it,
it's mine.

24:54.917 --> 24:55.917
Trevor Evans?

24:55.984 --> 24:57.201
Yes, officers.

24:57.286 --> 24:58.319
Come with us.

24:58.370 --> 24:59.621
Hey, what's going on?

24:59.672 --> 25:01.155
Your friend here
seems to be involved

25:01.206 --> 25:04.825
in selling the answers
to a stolen test.

25:06.178 --> 25:07.545
The Mackenzie deal
came back.

25:07.630 --> 25:08.880
Two murderers down.

25:08.964 --> 25:10.924
Don't you wanna ask me
if they saw the fine print?

25:10.933 --> 25:13.351
Oh, no, of course you don't.

25:13.435 --> 25:14.835
Because you know they didn't

25:14.887 --> 25:16.354
because that report wasn't
in the fine print anymore.

25:16.438 --> 25:17.555
Donna--

25:17.640 --> 25:19.057
Cameron made you take it out,
didn't he?

25:19.141 --> 25:20.191
How'd you know?

25:20.276 --> 25:21.442
When I do my Donna shit
with you,

25:21.510 --> 25:23.478
it's not just for fun.
It's my job.

25:23.529 --> 25:26.064
Now why don't you tell me
why you didn't tell me?

25:26.148 --> 25:28.066
Because you hated me
when I was working in the gray.

25:28.150 --> 25:30.351
This is the black.
I didn't hate you.

25:30.402 --> 25:32.820
I was trying to stop you.

25:32.871 --> 25:34.522
And the truth is
what you were doing

25:34.573 --> 25:35.957
was right on the line.

25:36.024 --> 25:38.376
What he is making you do,
that's illegal.

25:38.460 --> 25:41.045
It's one time,
and it's not my case.

25:41.130 --> 25:42.246
It might not be your case,

25:42.331 --> 25:45.416
but it's definitely
not just one time.

25:45.501 --> 25:48.002
I was here all night
going through his past cases.

25:48.053 --> 25:49.837
How many?

25:49.888 --> 25:52.724
Too many.
And I'll tell you another thing.

25:52.808 --> 25:55.209
I bet his first time he thought
would be his last time.

25:55.260 --> 25:56.427
Donna.

25:56.512 --> 25:57.812
If you want somebody
to just sit at her desk,

25:57.879 --> 25:59.213
answer your phones,
and pick up your dry cleaning,

25:59.264 --> 26:02.483
then put out a want ad,
because that's not me.

26:02.551 --> 26:03.901
I'm gonna tell you
what I think.

26:03.986 --> 26:08.573
And what I think is,
if you do this,

26:08.657 --> 26:11.859
you're gonna keep doing it.

26:11.910 --> 26:14.946
Donna, I need you to--

26:15.030 --> 26:16.247
where the hell's Donna?

26:16.332 --> 26:18.616
I don't know.
I was waiting for her myself.

26:18.701 --> 26:20.535
Wait somewhere else.

26:20.586 --> 26:22.754
- Harvey, listen--
- No, don't "Harvey" me.

26:22.838 --> 26:25.540
You went to my guy
about my case behind my back.

26:25.591 --> 26:28.543
So what you need to do now
is stay out of my face.

26:41.015 --> 26:43.967
They told me this is
where I'd find women's softball.

26:44.052 --> 26:46.687
It is now.

26:48.639 --> 26:50.724
All right, old man,

26:50.775 --> 26:53.259
stand back while I knock
the cover off a few balls.

26:53.311 --> 26:56.196
Easy, Reggie Jackson.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.617
I think you're maybe
forgetting I hit .385.

27:02.653 --> 27:05.956
Who doesn't hit
at least .350 in high school?

27:06.040 --> 27:08.375
Marcus didn't.

27:08.442 --> 27:09.876
Don't give
your brother shit.

27:09.944 --> 27:12.129
He's not here
to defend himself.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.715
Pussy.

27:14.782 --> 27:17.834
Hey, if he's not here
to defend himself...

27:17.919 --> 27:21.088
Yeah, he's not here
to hear it.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.591
Cheers.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.810
So what's going on?

27:27.929 --> 27:28.962
I don't know what to do.

27:29.013 --> 27:31.898
Well, breaking the law
isn't worth it

27:31.966 --> 27:33.266
no matter what the guy did.

27:33.317 --> 27:34.651
How'd you know?

27:34.736 --> 27:37.137
You're a prosecutor.
You told me you had a problem.

27:37.188 --> 27:38.822
Well, it's not
that simple, Dad.

27:38.906 --> 27:40.586
It's not just me,
and if I don't let it go,

27:40.608 --> 27:41.808
I'll get fired.

27:41.859 --> 27:43.360
If you do?

27:43.444 --> 27:45.162
I tell him
I'm only doing this once,

27:45.246 --> 27:47.313
and I'm only doing it
because it's his case,

27:47.365 --> 27:49.149
and I'll never do it
on one of mine.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.785
And then I keep knocking
the covers off the bad guys,

27:51.836 --> 27:52.986
which is what I do,

27:53.037 --> 27:56.206
and I don't bat .385,
I bat a thousand.

27:56.290 --> 27:58.291
All right.

28:00.962 --> 28:02.262
You know, I'm gonna
tell you something

28:02.329 --> 28:03.680
I never told you before.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.182
You might not wanna
hear it now,

28:05.266 --> 28:07.167
but you know what
your grandmother said to me

28:07.218 --> 28:09.219
when I told her I was gonna
ask your mother to marry me?

28:09.303 --> 28:10.720
What?

28:10.805 --> 28:13.339
Don't, because if she'll cheat
on someone else with you,

28:13.391 --> 28:15.341
she'll cheat on you
with someone else.

28:15.393 --> 28:16.676
We had a huge blowout.

28:16.727 --> 28:18.845
I told her
to shove it up her ass.

28:18.896 --> 28:20.197
Lily wouldn't do that.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.699
She'd be different with me
because Lily loved me.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.201
- Dad--
- No, no, let me finish.

28:24.285 --> 28:25.535
Then, years later,

28:25.620 --> 28:29.539
I found out the other guy
thought the same thing.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.541
What I'm trying to say is,

28:31.626 --> 28:33.994
even if Cameron believes

28:34.045 --> 28:37.047
that he'll never
make you do it again,

28:37.131 --> 28:39.466
he will.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.594
Okay, out with it.
Drop the hammer.

28:50.678 --> 28:53.563
They know Trevor
isn't in the class,

28:53.648 --> 28:55.432
so they know
he couldn't have been the one

28:55.516 --> 28:57.067
to steal the test.

28:57.151 --> 29:00.904
And they won't expel him
if he gives you up.

29:00.988 --> 29:02.272
How do you know that?

29:02.356 --> 29:05.525
I watch <i>Law & Order.</i>
I'm not an idiot.

29:08.162 --> 29:09.579
He'll never turn me in.

29:09.664 --> 29:12.616
- But you feel guilty.
- I am guilty.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.751
So you wanna
turn yourself in?

29:14.836 --> 29:17.237
They'll fail me.

29:17.288 --> 29:19.039
But I still have a 3.8.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.374
You know, there's no way Harvard
rescinds my acceptance.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.545
That goddamn kid.

29:25.596 --> 29:28.048
I guess I know
where you come down on this.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.100
Oh, he's an asshole
in the making,

29:30.184 --> 29:33.720
no question about it.

29:33.771 --> 29:36.273
But?

29:38.359 --> 29:39.976
After you lost
your mom and dad,

29:40.061 --> 29:42.262
the Evanses offered
to take you in.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.898
They offered
because that little boy

29:44.949 --> 29:47.567
cried all night
for a month.

29:47.618 --> 29:48.985
He begged them.

29:49.070 --> 29:52.289
I'm not saying
he's the same kid anymore,

29:52.373 --> 29:54.958
but that kid
is in there.

30:01.799 --> 30:03.884
Harvey, just the man
I wanted to see.

30:03.951 --> 30:05.118
Why is that?

30:05.169 --> 30:06.786
'Cause I wanted you
to be the first to know.

30:06.837 --> 30:08.755
I'm looking
at my new head litigator.

30:08.806 --> 30:11.675
I'm afraid you're not.

30:11.759 --> 30:13.126
And why is that?

30:13.177 --> 30:16.296
Because after I show you this,
you're gonna demand this.

30:18.465 --> 30:20.267
You disclosed that report.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.136
That affidavit
says I made a mistake,

30:23.187 --> 30:24.688
an honest mistake.

30:24.772 --> 30:27.473
And this one says,
as my penance,

30:27.525 --> 30:29.693
I'm resigning.

30:29.777 --> 30:32.145
So you're just gonna put
two killers back on the street.

30:32.196 --> 30:34.197
If you're half the prosecutor
you say you are,

30:34.282 --> 30:35.865
you can still
put 'em away.

30:35.950 --> 30:37.167
And I don't give a shit

30:37.251 --> 30:38.668
whether you feel comfortable
with that or not,

30:38.753 --> 30:40.253
because you said
it was your case,

30:40.321 --> 30:41.988
but you made it my case.

30:42.039 --> 30:43.823
I made it our case,
because I thought

30:43.874 --> 30:45.658
you were about putting
bad guys behind bars.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.877
Cameron, you asked
what if they got out

30:47.962 --> 30:49.045
and killed my father?

30:49.130 --> 30:50.847
Well, I think
the question is:

30:50.932 --> 30:53.383
What if my father found out
what I did to put them in?

30:54.885 --> 30:57.503
You goddamn pussy.

30:57.555 --> 31:00.056
The only thing
that makes me a pussy

31:00.141 --> 31:02.359
is that I didn't send
that affidavit in

31:02.443 --> 31:05.278
the second I found out.

31:14.521 --> 31:16.573
Sir, I know you
offered Trevor Evans

31:16.657 --> 31:20.460
a way to avoid expulsion.

31:20.527 --> 31:22.195
Well, the reason
he didn't take it

31:22.246 --> 31:24.664
is he was trying--

31:24.715 --> 31:26.416
he was trying
to protect me.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.386
He's the one
who sold the test,

31:29.470 --> 31:32.806
but I'm the one
who took it.

31:32.873 --> 31:34.040
So please,

31:34.091 --> 31:36.376
do not punish him
for his loyalty to me.

31:36.427 --> 31:39.712
Truth is,
with the way his grades are,

31:39.764 --> 31:41.898
I don't think
it'll matter anyway.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.484
So I'll tell you what,

31:44.551 --> 31:46.052
I'm not going to expel
your friend.

31:48.022 --> 31:49.489
Oh, thank you, sir.

31:49.556 --> 31:51.741
There's just one thing.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.610
You're his roommate.

31:53.694 --> 31:56.413
And you scored perfectly
on that test.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.665
I knew it was you.

31:58.732 --> 32:00.617
I also know you're only
sitting here in front of my face

32:00.701 --> 32:02.902
because you think whatever
I do to you won't matter.

32:02.953 --> 32:04.254
No, sir,
that's not true.

32:04.338 --> 32:06.873
Well, let me tell you
what is true,

32:06.924 --> 32:09.125
you little piece of shit.

32:09.210 --> 32:11.878
The young woman you sold
the test to was my daughter.

32:11.929 --> 32:14.014
They're demanding
my resignation.

32:14.081 --> 32:16.049
And as my last official act,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.268
I'm expelling you
from this school,

32:18.352 --> 32:22.472
and then
I'm gonna call Harvard.

32:22.556 --> 32:23.923
Believe me when I tell you,

32:23.974 --> 32:26.109
you're never going there.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.739
I decided what kind
of attorney I want to be.

32:39.790 --> 32:41.607
I heard.
You quit.

32:41.659 --> 32:44.627
Did you hear I also turned
over the toxicology report?

32:44.712 --> 32:47.080
You didn't.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.299
Thought you were
supposed to know everything.

32:49.383 --> 32:51.584
How'd you not know this?

32:51.635 --> 32:53.253
Well, I knew that you were
either gonna take that promotion

32:53.304 --> 32:54.620
or you were gonna quit.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.840
And either way, I wasn't
sticking around to find out.

32:56.924 --> 32:59.125
- You quit?
- Damn straight.

32:59.176 --> 33:01.344
I'm not working at a place
headed by a viper.

33:01.429 --> 33:03.513
Donna, I can't get you
another job.

33:03.597 --> 33:06.433
Oh, well, that's gonna make
my decision easier.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.984
What does that mean?

33:08.069 --> 33:09.969
I'm choosing
between Bratton Gould,

33:10.020 --> 33:11.855
Skadden Arps,
and O'Melveny & Myers.

33:11.939 --> 33:13.639
If I had another one,
I don't know what I'd do.

33:13.691 --> 33:16.493
You know,
it just occurred to me

33:16.577 --> 33:18.945
that you and I
don't work together anymore.

33:18.996 --> 33:21.114
Yeah, that didn't
just occur to you.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.649
No, it didn't.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.952
Do you know
how I know that?

33:26.003 --> 33:27.337
'Cause you knew
I'd show up here

33:27.421 --> 33:28.872
the second
you heard I quit?

33:28.956 --> 33:30.673
Why do you think
I have this in my hand?

33:30.758 --> 33:33.042
What are we waiting for?

33:33.127 --> 33:35.167
For you to figure out
that it's time to come inside.

33:48.889 --> 33:50.174
So let me get this straight.

33:50.244 --> 33:51.578
You turned me down before,

33:51.662 --> 33:53.463
and now you're saying
you want to come back?

33:53.531 --> 33:54.781
Yes.

33:54.865 --> 33:56.399
And it has nothing
to do with our coup?

33:56.450 --> 33:57.834
I didn't even know
you did it

33:57.901 --> 33:59.285
until I saw your name
on the wall.

33:59.370 --> 34:00.420
You got it up there fast.

34:00.504 --> 34:01.504
Don't tell 'em
you're coming,

34:01.572 --> 34:03.456
and slam the door
behind them.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.376
Now why should I take someone
who waited for me to win?

34:06.427 --> 34:07.377
Because I'm someone
you trusted with the news

34:07.428 --> 34:08.878
in the first place.

34:08.929 --> 34:11.848
I also trusted
all the people who voted for me.

34:11.915 --> 34:15.101
Come clean, Harvey.
What changed your mind?

34:15.186 --> 34:16.386
Instead of thinking

34:16.437 --> 34:18.554
about what I wanna be doing
in ten years,

34:18.606 --> 34:22.475
I started thinking about
who I want to be doing it with.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.811
Me over him.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.532
Terms are nonnegotiable.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.234
You get what I give you.

34:31.284 --> 34:34.270
Fine by me, but I'm getting
my own secretary.

34:34.321 --> 34:35.938
Associates don't get
their own secretaries.

34:35.989 --> 34:37.607
This isn't
about the associate.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.275
It's about the secretary,

34:39.326 --> 34:40.827
and I'm not coming here
without her.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.463
She must be very special.

34:43.547 --> 34:45.965
She is.

34:47.751 --> 34:49.168
Difference comes out
of your pocket.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.837
As long
as she never knows.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.755
Welcome back, Harvey.

34:52.806 --> 34:55.175
You start Monday.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.176
Give it up.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.344
Oh, no.

35:04.151 --> 35:06.486
So what was so important

35:06.570 --> 35:09.305
that you just had to see me?

35:09.356 --> 35:10.490
I don't know how to say it,

35:10.574 --> 35:11.608
so I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

35:11.659 --> 35:14.143
But I don't want
to lose you.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.615
Come work for me.

35:18.666 --> 35:19.616
What?

35:19.667 --> 35:20.917
Don't go to Skadden.

35:20.984 --> 35:23.586
I took a job
at my old firm.

35:24.872 --> 35:27.090
I was hoping
you'd be happy.

35:27.157 --> 35:28.324
What? I am.

35:28.375 --> 35:29.325
If this is
about your rule--

35:29.376 --> 35:30.660
No, it's not about that.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.428
Because if I had known
that this was gonna happen,

35:32.496 --> 35:35.265
I never would
have come over.

35:35.332 --> 35:37.333
Why didn't you know
that it was gonna happen?

35:37.384 --> 35:40.470
Because I hadn't thought
about taking another job before.

35:40.521 --> 35:43.056
And when I did...

35:45.726 --> 35:47.694
I thought about who I wanted
to take it with.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.012
Look, I don't wanna find out
what kind of lawyer

35:50.064 --> 35:52.181
I'd be without you.

36:01.024 --> 36:03.660
Okay, I will come work with you
on two conditions.

36:03.711 --> 36:06.079
First, we put it
out of our minds,

36:06.163 --> 36:08.715
and we never
mention it again.

36:10.718 --> 36:13.336
Second?

36:13.387 --> 36:16.472
You're giving me
a huge goddamn signing bonus.

36:18.842 --> 36:20.727
How do you know
that's enough?

36:20.811 --> 36:22.931
Because you're the one
who's gonna fill in the amount.

36:23.013 --> 36:25.899
Oh, my God,
you really do need me...

36:25.983 --> 36:27.850
To stop you
from doing shit like this.

36:27.902 --> 36:28.851
Oh, well...

36:28.903 --> 36:30.886
In the future.

36:34.108 --> 36:35.057
Hmm.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.726
What?

36:36.777 --> 36:37.994
We're gonna need
a new ritual.

36:38.061 --> 36:40.563
Well, maybe we can think
of something to do

36:40.614 --> 36:43.032
with a can opener.

36:43.083 --> 36:46.002
Harvey, that's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

36:46.069 --> 36:48.204
Jeez.

36:50.073 --> 36:52.342
Actually...

36:57.848 --> 36:59.215
What are you doing here,
Harvey?

36:59.266 --> 37:00.750
It's 7:00 a.m.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.135
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

37:02.219 --> 37:03.686
I love this place.

37:03.754 --> 37:04.887
Really?

37:04.939 --> 37:06.940
You've only ever been here
once before.

37:07.024 --> 37:07.974
How'd you know that?

37:08.058 --> 37:10.360
I know.

37:11.695 --> 37:14.480
You and Stephen,
it bothers me.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.866
I know it's not fair,
but it does.

37:16.933 --> 37:18.151
Good.

37:18.235 --> 37:19.156
What do you mean, good?

37:19.236 --> 37:20.936
I mean,
we both knew it.

37:20.988 --> 37:23.272
It's good that you finally
were able to say it.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.241
You realize just
because it bothers me,

37:25.292 --> 37:26.626
it doesn't mean
that I want us to be--

37:26.710 --> 37:28.628
I know.

37:28.712 --> 37:30.630
Jeez.

37:32.499 --> 37:35.117
You know this is exactly
why I had that policy.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.953
Well, then why did
you change it?

37:39.640 --> 37:43.176
Because I have to live
my life, Harvey.

37:43.260 --> 37:45.294
I've never apologized
for who I am,

37:45.346 --> 37:46.796
and I'm not gonna
start now.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.598
You don't need
to apologize for anything.

37:48.649 --> 37:51.684
I know.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.653
But you do.

37:55.739 --> 37:58.408
For taking so long
to say that it bothered you.

37:58.475 --> 37:59.692
Jesus.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.912
And let's just
put an order in

38:02.979 --> 38:04.998
for the valet
to hold my suit jackets,

38:05.082 --> 38:06.783
and then we c--
Harvey.

38:06.834 --> 38:08.084
Louis.

38:08.151 --> 38:09.318
What are you doing here?

38:09.370 --> 38:10.670
You're not due back

38:10.754 --> 38:11.838
for another two years,
three months, and five days,

38:11.922 --> 38:13.039
not that I'm keeping track.

38:13.123 --> 38:15.041
Change of plans.
I'm back today.

38:15.125 --> 38:18.628
Who's your girlfriend?

38:18.679 --> 38:20.513
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

38:20.597 --> 38:22.382
I'm his girl Friday.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.133
Associates
don't get secretaries.

38:24.184 --> 38:25.835
I'm not like
other associates,

38:25.886 --> 38:27.220
and she's not like
other secretaries.

38:27.304 --> 38:29.972
- Bullshit.
- Donna?

38:30.024 --> 38:31.691
Okay, listen, <i>Rain Man,</i>
you wear lifts in your shoes,

38:31.775 --> 38:33.359
you want braces,
but you don't have the balls,

38:33.444 --> 38:34.861
and you have a cat

38:34.945 --> 38:38.514
that you love
more than it loves you.

38:38.565 --> 38:40.483
- Good to see you, Louis.
- Mm.

38:40.534 --> 38:43.703
I need a day.

38:45.956 --> 38:46.873
You going down?

38:46.957 --> 38:49.208
All the way up, asshole.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.026
I'll take the ride.

38:55.883 --> 38:58.051
Hey.
Hey.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.589
What's that?

39:03.674 --> 39:05.207
This is my way
of showing you

39:05.259 --> 39:07.677
that no matter
what you choose,

39:07.728 --> 39:09.896
I support you.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.848
And if your dream
is to go to Stanford,

39:11.899 --> 39:14.901
then that's my dream
for you too.

39:21.892 --> 39:23.693
How does it look?

39:23.744 --> 39:26.696
I have to admit,
it looks pretty good.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.867
So what changed
your mind?

39:45.099 --> 39:46.382
You got into Harvard?

39:46.433 --> 39:48.851
It's a--
it's a long story,

39:48.919 --> 39:50.419
but I have to go
right now.

39:50.471 --> 39:53.639
I wanted to be here
when you got home.

39:53.724 --> 39:54.857
But if you let me,

39:54.925 --> 39:56.425
I'd like to come
straight back here

39:56.477 --> 39:57.727
and tell you
the whole thing.

39:57.778 --> 39:59.445
Okay.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.697
Okay.

40:10.865 --> 40:13.984
Any progress
getting to Mariga?

40:14.035 --> 40:15.298
Cameron's not just bluffing

40:15.299 --> 40:17.050
about what Mariga's
gonna say.

40:17.135 --> 40:18.135
He doesn't even have him.

40:18.136 --> 40:19.136
That means we--

40:19.187 --> 40:21.504
We win.
It's over.

40:23.474 --> 40:26.560
Ah, it's gonna be fun
telling Cameron that.

40:26.644 --> 40:28.028
It's gonna be fun for Mike.

40:28.112 --> 40:30.480
I've got
something else to do,

40:30.531 --> 40:32.816
and it's not
gonna be fun.

40:32.867 --> 40:34.735
Is that
why we're up here?

40:34.819 --> 40:36.686
You remember
when you told me you decided

40:36.738 --> 40:39.856
to take Gordon, Schmidt,
and Van Dyke down?

40:39.907 --> 40:42.125
I guess that is
why we're up here.

40:42.193 --> 40:43.577
You said,
take them in the night

40:43.661 --> 40:45.361
because nighttime's
when they're sleeping.

40:45.413 --> 40:46.713
And you thought
I was wrong.

40:46.798 --> 40:49.249
And then you said
if I were ever in your shoes,

40:49.333 --> 40:53.053
I might think differently.

40:53.137 --> 40:54.838
What'd you do, Harvey?

40:54.889 --> 40:57.207
I made a move
in the night.

40:59.060 --> 41:01.478
I get Ava Hessington
acquitted...

41:03.765 --> 41:05.548
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

41:15.743 --> 41:17.727
I guess congratulations
are in order.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.539
I'm here to tell you
I don't want it anymore.

41:19.580 --> 41:21.415
Get out of my sight.

41:44.055 --> 41:45.889
You look ready
to attack.

41:45.940 --> 41:48.058
Does Harvey know his puppy's
off his leash?

41:48.109 --> 41:49.926
Harvey said he didn't need
to waste a trip down here

41:49.977 --> 41:52.595
just for me to tell you
I have my eye on the ball.

41:52.647 --> 41:54.865
I'm afraid
I don't follow you.

41:54.932 --> 41:56.266
Mariga.

41:56.317 --> 41:58.201
You weren't lying
about what he would say.

41:58.269 --> 42:00.270
You were lying about having him
in the first place.

42:00.321 --> 42:02.041
This whole thing
was designed just to get us

42:02.106 --> 42:04.574
to sign your bullshit deal.

42:04.625 --> 42:05.709
You're right.

42:05.776 --> 42:07.377
We didn't have him,
but we do now,

42:07.444 --> 42:09.329
and he's on a flight
as we speak.

42:09.413 --> 42:11.581
So you do me a favor,
and you tell Harvey

42:11.632 --> 42:13.793
he can take that bullshit deal
and shove it up his ass,

42:13.835 --> 42:14.968
'cause we're going
to trial.

42:15.052 --> 42:16.136
No way.

42:16.220 --> 42:17.287
If you didn't have
Mariga yesterday,

42:17.338 --> 42:18.621
you don't have him today.

42:18.673 --> 42:21.141
Why don't you ask
your friend Stephen Huntley?

42:21.225 --> 42:24.261
He's the one who led me
right to him.
