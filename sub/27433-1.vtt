WEBVTT

00:37.124 --> 00:38.647
So, this is for, uh,

00:38.690 --> 00:39.909
New York Times Magazine?

00:39.952 --> 00:42.085
No. I'm sorry, that...

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
there...

00:43.739 --> 00:46.046
mm... no, I freelance.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.525
I write
for different magazines,

00:47.569 --> 00:49.136
but this is a personal matter.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.485
A personal matter?

00:50.528 --> 00:52.313
Yes, I'm sorry. Is that okay?

00:52.356 --> 00:53.923
No, it's absolutely okay.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.925
May I ask what-what this is
regarding and...?

00:55.968 --> 00:58.710
Uh, it's about my son.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.974
Okay. How can I help?

01:02.975 --> 01:05.325
He...

01:07.328 --> 01:11.549
There are moments
that I look at him,

01:11.593 --> 01:14.204
this kid that I raised,

01:14.248 --> 01:17.381
who I thought I knew
inside and out,

01:17.425 --> 01:20.167
and I wonder who he is.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.910
He's been doing all sorts
of drugs,

01:24.954 --> 01:26.999
but he's addicted
to crystal meth,

01:27.043 --> 01:31.830
which seems, uh, to be
the worst of all of 'em.

01:31.874 --> 01:34.920
And I guess I'm here

01:34.964 --> 01:39.099
because I just want to know...

01:39.142 --> 01:41.927
all that I can about...

01:41.971 --> 01:43.842
all of it.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.670
Know your enemies, right?

01:45.714 --> 01:47.933
So...

01:50.197 --> 01:52.590
My two big questions are,

01:52.634 --> 01:55.245
wh-what is it doing to him,

01:55.289 --> 01:58.640
and what can I do to help him?

02:56.437 --> 02:58.395
Marin General Hospital.
How may I help you?

02:58.439 --> 03:01.746
Hi. My son has gone missing,

03:01.790 --> 03:04.488
and I wanted to check
to see if he had...

03:04.532 --> 03:06.186
uh, maybe had been brought in

03:06.229 --> 03:09.493
or-or if-if there'd been
an accident.

03:09.537 --> 03:12.279
Can I have name
and description, sir?

03:12.322 --> 03:13.845
Nicolas Sheff.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.239
S-H-E-F-F.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.849
He is...

03:17.893 --> 03:19.590
18 years old.

03:19.634 --> 03:22.767
He is just over six feet tall.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.508
About 130 pounds.

03:24.552 --> 03:27.729
Maybe less.
I-I don't know. Um...

03:27.772 --> 03:30.253
He has shoulder-length
brown hair

03:30.297 --> 03:32.386
and green eyes.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.170
Thank you. Please hold.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.259
Okay.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.479
- Mr. Sheff?
- Yes.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.655
Uh, there's no one
by that name, sir.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.310
Okay. Thank you.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.788
He's been gone for two days.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.442
What do you mean he's gone?

04:28.485 --> 04:30.357
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.793
- I don't know.
- Two days?

04:31.836 --> 04:33.316
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.231
Uh, I didn't want
to worry you, I guess.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.712
- I just...
- I'm his mother, David.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.627
Didn't you see this coming?

04:39.670 --> 04:40.802
Uh, no.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.064
What?

04:42.107 --> 04:43.892
No, no, I didn't see it coming.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.981
If I'd seen it coming,
I would've done something.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.331
It was just a question, David.
Jesus.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.551
I haven't been talking with him
a lot lately.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.727
Well, maybe that's why you
shouldn't be giving me advice

04:52.770 --> 04:54.163
in parenting, right?

04:54.206 --> 04:56.165
Fuck, Vicki.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.646
Can we just not blame
each other right now? That's...

04:58.689 --> 05:00.561
Who's blaming who here?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.780
If I hardly ever see him,
it's because he's supposed

05:02.824 --> 05:04.478
to come to I.A.
for the holidays

05:04.521 --> 05:06.523
but always finds a reason
not to come.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.657
Well, that's not my fault,
is it?

05:45.649 --> 05:47.259
Nic.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.698
Here's your little brother.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.004
Tight.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.397
Just support his head.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.580
Hi, Jasper.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.278
Hi, little boy.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.371
This is amazing.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.376
He's sticking his tongue out.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.730
Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.732
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.560
- I'll miss you this summer.
- Me, too.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.649
- Okay, write me.
- Write me back.

06:28.692 --> 06:29.998
Work on your French.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.391
Oui, madame.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.609
Have a great summer.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.655
And say hi to your mom.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.834
- Everything.
- Everything.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.511
Ya!

07:48.555 --> 07:50.382
Come on.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.667
Hey.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.408
- Where have you been?
- Yeah, I just need to sleep,

08:16.452 --> 08:17.975
- all right?
- What have you been doing?

08:18.019 --> 08:19.847
I just need to sleep,
all right? Leave me alone.

08:20.891 --> 08:24.112
Guys, go downstairs.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.810
I'll be there in a minute.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.061
Ow.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.682
Look, man, I'm-I'm, uh...

09:12.726 --> 09:17.121
I'm really sorry, all right?
And-and I, uh...

09:17.165 --> 09:19.384
I fucked up,
and it was a mistake, but...

09:19.428 --> 09:21.735
it was a one-time mistake,
all right? I learned my lesson.

09:21.778 --> 09:25.216
I don't want to go through this
shit again, all right? So...

09:25.260 --> 09:26.348
- Let's just go inside.
- No.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.828
They're professionals.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.612
Let's just listen
to what they have to say.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.396
Look, I'm 18, all right?!
You can't force me!

09:31.440 --> 09:33.442
Hey.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.751
This got out of hand, right?

09:37.794 --> 09:39.535
Don't you think?

09:43.234 --> 09:45.236
Come on.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.761
All right.

09:47.804 --> 09:51.591
Okay. Okay.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.205
I'm doing it for you.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.583
He needs treatment. And fast.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.281
There's still a lot of drugs
in his system.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.502
And, worst of all,
he's in denial.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.984
Um, can you help him?

10:37.027 --> 10:39.203
Oh, yeah. I mean,

10:39.247 --> 10:42.206
a lot of the people here
are not here by choice.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.644
And they have just
as much chance as anybody.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.646
Okay.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.865
So, we have a free bed.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.651
So, if you want, we can check
him in for a 28-day treatment

10:51.694 --> 10:53.522
and then we evaluate.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.656
Um...

10:56.699 --> 10:58.440
what is your success rate?

10:58.483 --> 11:00.703
On the high end, 80%.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.531
On the low end,

11:02.574 --> 11:04.707
25%.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.623
Look, he will have
daily consultations

11:07.667 --> 11:09.843
with a staff psychiatrist
and physician.

11:09.886 --> 11:13.803
We have daily N.A.
and A.A. meetings.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.284
He'll be monitored
very closely.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.896
Thank you.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.117
And last page.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.381
Everything.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.212
Everything.

12:16.561 --> 12:19.521
Why are you
always in this room?

12:19.564 --> 12:21.741
You hardly ever come out
of here.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.525
It's like you're a vampire.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.529
I read.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.097
I draw.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.708
You know what we should do?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.754
We should go surfing.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.538
Yeah.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.409
That sound good?

12:38.453 --> 12:41.151
I'm kind of into other things
now, you know?

12:41.195 --> 12:44.851
Reading misanthropes and
seriously depressed writers.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.461
Oh, come on, they're...

12:46.504 --> 12:48.202
they're kind of great,
though, right?

12:48.245 --> 12:49.246
I get it.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.816
It'll pass, though.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.818
It always does.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.733
What does?

12:57.777 --> 13:01.998
The feeling of being alienated
and isolated.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.913
Huh, that really helps.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.002
Thanks for the advice, Dad.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.049
Okay.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.487
All right. That was...

13:12.530 --> 13:14.010
That came out wrong. I'm sorry.

13:14.054 --> 13:16.491
Mm-mm.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.850
All right. Your-your idea.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.939
Hey.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.856
Hey, Dad.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.990
So, we feel
he's made great progress.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.209
- Right, Nic?
- Hi. -Hey.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.211
- That's great.
- That's great.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.083
So we should maybe talk
about the coming weeks, Nic.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.650
Mm. I think I need to...
I think I need

13:45.694 --> 13:47.783
a little bit more time
in rehab. So if it's...

13:47.827 --> 13:50.090
if it's all right
with you guys, I was wondering

13:50.133 --> 13:51.743
if I could stay
in the halfway house here.

13:51.787 --> 13:56.226
The halfway house
is an open living facility

13:56.270 --> 13:58.228
with follow-up every night,

13:58.272 --> 14:01.753
and we would help him
find a job.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.843
Right. I don't want to...

14:03.886 --> 14:06.497
go to college...

14:06.541 --> 14:08.891
- right now.
- Oh?

14:08.935 --> 14:11.894
Okay. Uh, um, and do what?

14:11.938 --> 14:15.506
I think I need
to be independent.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.424
Dad, I'm telling you,
this is...

14:22.426 --> 14:24.951
It's gonna be good.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.561
What is he gonna do,

14:26.604 --> 14:28.215
make coffee
for the rest of his life?

14:28.258 --> 14:29.564
You know what,
Frederick told me

14:29.607 --> 14:31.566
that they have friends
that had a son

14:31.609 --> 14:33.568
that did a four-week program
and that wasn't enough

14:33.611 --> 14:35.831
and now he's doing
a year program.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.399
I wish you wouldn't talk
to everybody about it.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.142
What does that got to do
with anything?

14:42.185 --> 14:43.926
To protect Nic.
I mean, at some point,

14:43.970 --> 14:45.885
he's gonna want to get on
with his life.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.930
And maybe it's best that
not everybody knows about this.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.932
Okay.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.501
Can we not make this about me?

14:53.544 --> 14:54.937
Uh...
All right.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.331
Look, Nic needs some more time.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.681
And that's fine.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.074
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.249
Okay?

15:02.292 --> 15:03.903
Yeah, okay.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.173
Shh.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.395
David Sheff.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.919
Hi, Mr. Sheff.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.225
This is Annie Goldblum
from the Ohlhoff Center.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.358
Oh, yes. Hi. Hello.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.012
Listen,
I am sorry to disturb you,

15:26.055 --> 15:28.884
but I need to inform you
about Nic.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.278
Okay.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.889
He left the facility today
during free time,

15:33.933 --> 15:36.805
and he hasn't returned since.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.547
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheff,

15:39.590 --> 15:41.070
but please don't despair.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.246
This happens.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.509
But I...

15:45.553 --> 15:47.903
I thought you said
he was doing so well.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.951
You should think of this
as part of the process.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.301
Relapse is a part of recovery.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.259
Relapse is part of recovery?

15:56.303 --> 15:59.306
Yeah. It-it's a part
of Nic's learning process.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.090
Well, uh, that's...

16:01.134 --> 16:04.528
that's like saying crashing
is part of pilot training.

16:04.572 --> 16:07.270
Look, he'll be back,
and probably really quick.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.142
Do you have somebody
out looking for him?

16:09.185 --> 16:11.057
It is not our responsibility

16:11.100 --> 16:12.623
once he leaves the facility.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.364
- Okay.
- But he is welcome to...

16:50.966 --> 16:52.881
Excuse me.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.362
Have you seen a kid
hanging out around here?

16:55.405 --> 16:57.190
- No.
- No?

16:57.233 --> 16:59.540
Okay, thank you.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.848
Wow. They don't want
to deal with that.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.110
Hey, Dad, you want
to smoke this?

17:48.154 --> 17:49.329
Hey, whoa.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.852
Wait. What...? Stop.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.114
- Put that away.
- We'll smoke this together.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.768
No, no, no. No.
Are you cra...

17:53.811 --> 17:55.422
- That's crazy.
- Well, I know you smoke.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.032
- Y... Well, yeah. I...
- So let's smoke together.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.642
No, no, no.
Occasionally, like...

17:58.686 --> 18:00.383
- Look, let's smoke to...
let's smoke together. -Listen.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.429
- Or I could just... You know what?
- No, stop it, stop it.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.647
- Stop. Stop.
- I'll just light it here a...

18:03.691 --> 18:04.779
You know what? You're right.

18:04.822 --> 18:05.997
I'll just light it here alone.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.564
Don't. Occasionally,

18:07.608 --> 18:08.826
- from time to time...
- Yeah?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.785
I will have a hit or two
at a party,

18:10.828 --> 18:12.569
but it's been a while,
so just...

18:12.613 --> 18:14.093
Oh, okay, so then just smoke...

18:14.136 --> 18:16.747
have-have a celebratory joint
with your son.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.402
N-No. God, come on.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.143
No. No, you're amazing.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.666
You got... you applied
to six colleges,

18:22.710 --> 18:24.103
you got into all of them?

18:24.146 --> 18:25.234
Yeah.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.280
Stop doubting yourself.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.020
Look at you.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.589
Give me that. Give me that.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.812
What?

18:37.855 --> 18:40.162
Nice-nice hit.
That was a good hit.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.427
- What?
- Well...

18:45.472 --> 18:49.476
Thank you. This is a nice...

18:49.519 --> 18:51.434
thing to do.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.917
You did a lot of drugs, right?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.745
I, uh...

18:57.788 --> 18:59.964
Yeah, I did my share.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.444
I experimented
with some drugs.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.967
I did.

19:05.492 --> 19:06.797
- But not harmless.
- What, is this...?

19:06.841 --> 19:08.234
There was a guy, and...
No, no.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.452
This is the lecture part?

19:09.496 --> 19:11.193
- Right?
- Yes.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.673
Dad, you worry too much,
all right?

19:12.716 --> 19:14.762
- Everyone does it.
- Just be careful.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.243
It's just a little pot.
I'm just partying a little.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.332
It's just... you know,
it's just once in a while.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.724
Mm-hmm.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.987
I deserve to party
a little now.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.511
- "Deserve to party."
- I do.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.601
Look, it just... it takes
the edge off things.

19:27.644 --> 19:31.126
It-it... it-it takes the edge
off of stupid all-day reality.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.304
Hmm.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.960
What is stupid about reality?

19:39.003 --> 19:40.918
You know, just like...

19:40.962 --> 19:44.879
like daily, stupid things
that don't matter.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.359
Okay.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.317
You cannot say
dumb shit like that,

19:48.361 --> 19:49.797
or you're gonna start
believing it.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.494
Right.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.222
Thanks for bringing that,
Karen.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.751
This is my home.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.624
A couple of weeks ago,
you told me

20:34.668 --> 20:38.193
that you had only done
crystal meth once.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.152
And the story has to be bigger
than that, right?

20:41.196 --> 20:43.329
- Mm-hmm.
- There's more to it.

20:43.372 --> 20:44.634
Yeah?

20:44.678 --> 20:45.896
David.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.071
We need to know.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.031
We need to know.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.906
I think I always liked it.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.995
What?

20:59.475 --> 21:02.304
Anything. Pot, alcohol,

21:02.348 --> 21:05.525
Ecstasy, cocaine, LSD.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.355
And you've been doing
all of that

21:09.398 --> 21:11.400
for what... years?

21:11.444 --> 21:13.446
A couple years, yeah.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.144
And crystal meth?

21:17.493 --> 21:19.539
Just a couple months.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.281
Wh-Why?

21:24.935 --> 21:25.936
I don't know.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.982
Um...

21:32.813 --> 21:35.642
When I tried it, I felt...

21:41.038 --> 21:44.477
I felt better
than I ever had, so...

21:44.520 --> 21:46.914
I just kept on doing it.

21:46.957 --> 21:50.178
I was worried that you
were smoking too much pot.

21:50.221 --> 21:54.704
Meanwhile, you're out doing
every drug on the planet?

21:54.748 --> 21:58.795
And hiding it and lying?

21:58.839 --> 22:00.362
Why?

22:01.624 --> 22:03.670
- I don't know. Um...
- Why?

22:03.713 --> 22:05.367
- Nic, tell me why.
- Ease up.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.543
- I don't know.
- I thought we were close.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.850
I thought we were closer
than most fathers and sons.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.808
Yeah, I feel like you're
always disappointed in me.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.288
You're disappointed
I didn't go to college.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.463
Can you blame me?!

22:14.507 --> 22:16.117
Just, uh, not too long ago,

22:16.160 --> 22:18.337
you were reading and you
were writing, and you were on

22:18.380 --> 22:19.773
the water polo team.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.340
And look at us now.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.863
- Dad... -Can you please stop?
- This isn't us.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.995
- This is not who we are.
- Just, please,

22:25.039 --> 22:26.693
both of you, stop.

22:26.736 --> 22:29.609
Dad, I'm really sorry
about everything.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.221
Dad, I'm so...

22:35.789 --> 22:38.182
I'm really sorry, Dad.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.363
Nic, what you have...

22:45.538 --> 22:47.975
...you're gonna find it again.

22:50.717 --> 22:53.850
And you're gonna get it back.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.376
Ow, ow, ow.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.676
Nic!

23:46.555 --> 23:48.557
Nic!

23:49.863 --> 23:51.255
Nic!

23:53.040 --> 23:54.737
Nic!

24:05.139 --> 24:07.141
Nic!

24:21.547 --> 24:22.983
Hey, Dad.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.724
Hey.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.377
How's New York?

24:26.421 --> 24:27.596
Fine. Good.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.989
Good interview today.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.425
- Nice.
- How are you?

24:30.469 --> 24:33.036
Oh, I'm-I'm doing good. Yeah.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.690
Yeah? You sure?

24:34.734 --> 24:36.518
Yeah. I don't... well...

24:36.562 --> 24:38.302
What?

24:38.346 --> 24:39.913
It's, uh...

24:39.956 --> 24:41.392
What's going on?

24:41.436 --> 24:44.308
Uh, we had this great
group session,

24:44.352 --> 24:46.920
and one of the guys here was
saying he would do anything

24:46.963 --> 24:49.052
for a chance to go to college,
but he can't.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.098
- Okay. -And when we were
talking later, he said,

24:51.141 --> 24:53.317
"You could still go to college.
Don't be an idiot.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.319
Go to college."

24:56.582 --> 24:58.105
I don't know, it's just crazy.

24:58.148 --> 25:01.151
I realized I don't think
I should stay behind.

25:01.195 --> 25:02.370
I love writing.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.938
And I feel like I'm good at it,

25:04.981 --> 25:07.723
and I do it a lot, but...

25:07.767 --> 25:10.596
obviously, there's still a lot

25:10.639 --> 25:12.989
for-for me to learn and...

25:14.600 --> 25:16.819
Anyway, um...

25:16.863 --> 25:19.648
I'd love to give it a go, if...

25:19.692 --> 25:22.521
you know, if it's all right
with you guys.

25:25.393 --> 25:28.875
Yeah. I'll talk to Karen
and to your mom.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.704
Back here.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.598
Have you met your roommate yet?

25:56.642 --> 25:57.817
Yeah, he seems nice.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.906
He's just in the hall.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.211
I feel for you, though.

26:02.648 --> 26:03.997
Ouch.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.564
No worries. I'll educate him.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.611
Before you know it, he'll be
listening to John Zorn.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.482
Ah.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.841
Well, I better get going.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.233
All right.

26:34.941 --> 26:39.336
- Everything.
- Everything.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.787
So, this is a poem

26:54.830 --> 26:56.397
by Charles Bukowski.

26:58.051 --> 27:02.446
Uh, this man saved my life
multiple times, so...

27:02.490 --> 27:06.015
"I changed jobs and cities,

27:06.059 --> 27:07.800
"I hated holidays,

27:07.843 --> 27:10.411
"babies, history,

27:10.454 --> 27:13.762
"newspapers, museums,
grandmothers,

27:13.806 --> 27:17.766
marriage, movies, spiders..."

27:17.810 --> 27:19.594
I want to see it,
I want to see it! Oh!

27:19.638 --> 27:20.943
"...garbagemen,

27:20.987 --> 27:22.249
- "English accents...
- Nice. Go, go, go!

27:22.292 --> 27:24.381
"...Spain, France,

27:24.425 --> 27:28.429
"Italy, walnuts
and the color orange.

27:28.472 --> 27:34.087
"Algebra angered me,
opera sickened me,

27:34.130 --> 27:35.697
"Charlie Chaplin was a fake

27:35.741 --> 27:38.265
and flowers were for pansies."

27:42.008 --> 27:44.010
Thanks.

27:59.939 --> 28:02.681
Come here.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.384
Mm.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.995
Hi.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.627
Where's your bathroom?

28:36.671 --> 28:38.151
Hey, is there a bathroom
I can use?

28:38.194 --> 28:39.239
Sure, honey.

28:39.282 --> 28:40.501
I'll show you where it is.

28:40.544 --> 28:42.111
Go right up, to the left.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.838
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Nic.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.622
How you doing?
What's going on?

29:58.666 --> 30:00.059
Oh, no, everything's
going great here, yeah.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.538
Oh, hey, thanks for sending
the money.

30:01.582 --> 30:02.713
I really appreciate that.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.977
Yeah,
you always hog the fondue.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.501
Oh, uh, Patrick and Phil
are going hiking tomorrow,

31:34.544 --> 31:37.591
so they'd like us to join them.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.510
Are Jasper and Daisy here,
by any...?

31:43.553 --> 31:45.512
- They're not here.
- No?

31:45.555 --> 31:47.253
- No. -Oh, they didn't
want to see me?

31:47.296 --> 31:49.820
- No, they didn't want to see you.
- Oh, that's tough to hear.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.911
Uh, well, I'm gonna just have
a seat on this couch

31:52.954 --> 31:54.042
and think about that, huh?

31:54.086 --> 31:55.478
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!

31:55.522 --> 31:58.873
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, it's Daisy!

31:58.917 --> 32:00.483
Oh, Jasper!

32:00.527 --> 32:03.356
Oh, my God, you guys
have gotten so much bigger!

32:03.399 --> 32:06.402
Oh! Oh, my God, you're so...!

32:07.664 --> 32:09.362
- Okay.
- Denmark, 1632.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.538
- Oh, no.
- We...

32:11.581 --> 32:15.672
Like to look back
at the history of Hula-Hoops.

32:15.716 --> 32:18.240
So important to, uh,

32:18.284 --> 32:20.590
the culture
of peace and wisdom.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.114
Um, a man

32:22.157 --> 32:24.420
- named George...
- Hoopulu.

32:24.464 --> 32:27.510
Was, uh... was, uh...

32:27.554 --> 32:29.208
And he thought...

32:29.251 --> 32:31.775
"Well, I'm going to

32:31.819 --> 32:33.386
develop something that I..."

32:38.913 --> 32:40.262
Hey.

32:40.306 --> 32:43.178
Hey. Uh...

32:43.222 --> 32:45.659
Hey. Um...

32:45.702 --> 32:48.618
I was wondering, do you think
I could use your car tonight?

32:48.662 --> 32:51.056
'Cause I just...
I want to go to a meeting.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.014
Oh. You got a meeting tonight?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.885
Yeah, sure.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.629
Y-You good?

32:59.673 --> 33:01.327
Yeah. I just...

33:02.589 --> 33:04.025
- They're crazy.
- Yeah.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.723
They're really excited
you're home.

33:08.769 --> 33:11.598
- I mean, I'll see you
in the morning, I guess. -Okay.

33:13.295 --> 33:15.254
All right.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.843
Yep! Mm!

34:02.475 --> 34:04.216
Where is it?!

34:04.259 --> 34:05.782
I don't have it!

34:05.826 --> 34:07.306
Where is it?!

34:07.349 --> 34:08.871
I don't have it!

34:08.916 --> 34:10.699
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.398
Where is it?!

34:12.440 --> 34:14.094
- Guys, guys, stop it.
- I don't know!

34:14.139 --> 34:15.922
Stop. Calm down.
What's going on in here?

34:15.966 --> 34:17.751
She took my money!

34:17.793 --> 34:19.187
I didn't.

34:19.231 --> 34:21.407
Okay, all right.
Come on, go downstairs

34:21.449 --> 34:23.148
- and see Mommy, all right?
- You took them!

34:23.190 --> 34:25.106
- -Don't, don't,
don't. Stop, stop.

34:25.150 --> 34:28.152
- I didn't take it, Daddy.
- I know you didn't. All right.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.938
Just go downstairs
and have some breakfast.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.070
Hey, what happened?

34:33.766 --> 34:35.116
They're gone.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.639
Okay. Are you sure
you had it in there?

34:37.684 --> 34:40.817
- Yeah. I had them yesterday.
- Okay.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.826
Jasper's savings disappeared.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.830
Yeah? That's weird.

34:59.184 --> 35:02.143
Did you take his eight dollars?

35:03.318 --> 35:04.798
What?

35:04.841 --> 35:06.104
You heard me.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.889
Why would I?

35:08.932 --> 35:11.674
It disappeared, and somebody
has to have done it.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.589
Right, so it's me.

35:13.633 --> 35:16.026
This is fucking ridiculous.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.247
Are you using again?

35:19.291 --> 35:22.076
Am I using again? No.

35:24.078 --> 35:26.820
Are you high right now?

35:26.863 --> 35:28.474
What the f...? No.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.563
- Fuck you.
- "Fuck you"?

35:30.606 --> 35:32.086
Don't talk to me that way.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.696
Are you high right now?

35:33.740 --> 35:35.089
No.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.699
You're not using right now?

35:36.743 --> 35:38.136
Are you using?

35:38.179 --> 35:41.835
No, Dad,
I'm not fucking high right now!

35:41.878 --> 35:43.880
Okay.

35:47.232 --> 35:50.539
Listen, it was a gamble
to send you to college.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.281
Everybody supported it.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.283
I'm glad that you went.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.982
Relapse is a part of rec...

35:59.026 --> 36:00.941
Relapse is part of recovery.

36:00.984 --> 36:04.901
- So we're gonna get...
- I better leave.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.782
- David?
- Hey.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.567
Just... where-where
are you gonna go?

36:18.611 --> 36:20.874
You can't just leave.
This is ridiculous.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.528
- Come on.
- Will you talk to us?

36:22.571 --> 36:24.486
I mean, really...
we just want to talk to you.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.923
Why don't...
Try to help us understand.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.621
- Or just let us help you.
- All right?

36:28.664 --> 36:30.144
I don't want your fucking help.
Don't you understand that?

36:30.188 --> 36:31.537
- No. -No, you don't.
Jesus Christ, then what

36:31.580 --> 36:32.886
the fuck is wrong
with you, then, huh?

36:32.929 --> 36:34.322
- What the hell is wrong
with you people? -Nic.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.845
- No! You fucking suffocate me.
- Hey.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.456
- Oh...
- You fucking suffocate me!

36:37.499 --> 36:39.936
Whoa, it's us?
We're the problem?

36:39.980 --> 36:42.200
No. You know what,
you're the one who's doing it!

36:42.243 --> 36:43.940
You're the one
who's causing it!

36:43.984 --> 36:46.204
And you're the only one
who can stop it!

36:46.247 --> 36:48.206
Fucking solve it!

37:16.495 --> 37:17.539
Fuck!

37:18.584 --> 37:20.107
Fuck!

39:13.220 --> 39:15.614
So, this is for the, uh,

39:15.657 --> 39:17.355
New York Times Magazine?

39:17.398 --> 39:19.139
Oh, no.

39:19.182 --> 39:20.488
I'm a... I-I write.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.055
I freelance
for different magazines,

39:22.098 --> 39:25.145
but this is...
this is a personal matter.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.408
- A personal matter?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.671
- Is that okay?
- Uh, no, it's absolutely okay.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.586
May I ask what-what
this is regarding?

39:31.630 --> 39:34.067
Uh, it's about my son.

39:34.110 --> 39:36.112
Okay.

39:39.115 --> 39:42.336
He's been doing
all sorts of drugs,

39:42.380 --> 39:44.251
but he's addicted
to crystal meth,

39:44.294 --> 39:48.081
which seems, uh, to be
the worst of all of them.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.388
And I guess I'm here

39:50.431 --> 39:54.130
because I just want to know
all that I can

39:54.174 --> 39:57.133
about all of it.

39:57.177 --> 39:59.701
So, uh, crystal meth, uh,

39:59.745 --> 40:01.616
gives the user a feeling
of instant euphoria...

40:01.660 --> 40:04.227
at least, when he takes it.

40:04.271 --> 40:05.446
You know,
but when it wears off,

40:05.490 --> 40:07.274
with a depletion
of as much as 60%

40:07.317 --> 40:10.233
of the dopamine,
the user has to up the doses.

40:10.277 --> 40:14.281
He has to double it, triple it
just to feel something,

40:14.324 --> 40:16.457
causing even more nerve damage,

40:16.501 --> 40:20.374
which, uh, increases
the compulsion to use.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.941
Horrible cycle.

40:23.986 --> 40:26.162
- What's up?
- Hey.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.904
Just doing some research.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.151
Hi.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.289
Are you hungry?

41:06.333 --> 41:09.467
You want to get something?

41:09.510 --> 41:12.121
Most guys just ask me
for a blow job.

41:12.165 --> 41:15.734
Oh, no. No, I'm just
offering something to eat.

41:15.777 --> 41:18.171
Maybe talk a little,
if you're up to it.

41:18.214 --> 41:21.566
Meth changes
the brain physically.

41:21.609 --> 41:24.046
Here we see the loss
of dopamine receptors

41:24.090 --> 41:26.048
in a meth user's brain.

41:26.092 --> 41:29.661
Now, I'm gonna show you
something else here.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.402
Do you see, uh, right here
there are these two red, uh...

41:32.446 --> 41:34.013
- large, red spots right here?
- Yeah.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.798
Okay, what that shows is
hyperactivity in the amygdala.

41:36.842 --> 41:38.757
And the amygdala is a region
of the brain

41:38.800 --> 41:41.281
that is linked
with anxiety and fear.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.457
Here the amygdala is screaming.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.245
What this shows us

41:49.289 --> 41:51.683
is that there is
a biological basis,

41:51.726 --> 41:55.425
uh, that meth users
may be unable...

41:55.469 --> 41:57.558
not unwilling, but unable...

41:57.602 --> 42:00.561
to participate
in normal treatment programs.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.084
I was in rehab, too.

42:03.216 --> 42:04.739
Three times.

42:04.783 --> 42:07.220
Ran away every time.

42:07.263 --> 42:09.701
Why?

42:09.744 --> 42:11.920
It was hell.

42:11.964 --> 42:14.357
Wanted to die.

42:14.401 --> 42:16.359
Why was it hell?

42:16.403 --> 42:19.232
All that God shit.

42:19.275 --> 42:21.234
Also, you just don't know
how good it gets

42:21.277 --> 42:23.236
when it gets good.

42:23.279 --> 42:25.368
It's hard to explain.

42:25.412 --> 42:27.283
Feels like cocaine

42:27.327 --> 42:28.894
but multiplied
by, like, a thousand.

42:28.937 --> 42:30.591
Or, like, a million.

42:30.635 --> 42:33.246
What does this mean for Nic?

42:33.289 --> 42:35.248
Look, Mr. Sheff, I...

42:35.291 --> 42:38.207
I don't know
who promised you what,

42:38.251 --> 42:42.255
but the success percentage
is in the single digits.

42:44.213 --> 42:45.563
Okay.

42:47.652 --> 42:50.437
What about your parents?

42:50.480 --> 42:52.613
What about them?

42:52.657 --> 42:55.485
Don't you think
they're worried about you?

42:55.529 --> 42:58.010
Shouldn't you...

42:58.053 --> 43:00.316
let them know that...

43:00.360 --> 43:02.623
They don't care.

43:02.667 --> 43:06.018
Well, I think they do.

43:07.062 --> 43:10.065
What the fuck do you know?

43:16.855 --> 43:18.813
I gotta go.

43:18.857 --> 43:22.034
Oh. Okay.

43:25.385 --> 43:27.953
Thanks.

43:45.579 --> 43:48.364
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey, now!

44:45.421 --> 44:46.988
God.

46:15.860 --> 46:17.775
I'm gonna try
some Klingon on you.

46:17.818 --> 46:18.906
Ready?

46:27.523 --> 46:29.699
- You know what I said?
- May I have a Coca-Cola?

46:29.743 --> 46:31.136
Exactly.

46:31.179 --> 46:32.964
That's it.

46:33.007 --> 46:34.966
That's exactly what I asked.

46:35.009 --> 46:36.445
Can I have a Coca-Cola?

46:36.489 --> 46:38.360
All right.
If you ask me in Klingon,

46:38.404 --> 46:40.406
maybe I'll get you a Coke.

46:57.989 --> 47:00.121
Hey.

47:12.655 --> 47:14.614
Oh, wow.

47:16.050 --> 47:18.270
This hasn't changed at all.

47:18.313 --> 47:21.403
This place.

47:22.535 --> 47:24.232
- Hey.
- So, how you doing?

47:24.276 --> 47:25.668
I'm doing great.

47:25.712 --> 47:27.888
You know, just, um...

47:27.932 --> 47:29.716
um...

47:29.759 --> 47:31.718
just doing
what needs to be done.

47:32.762 --> 47:34.590
What does that mean?

47:34.634 --> 47:38.377
Just being responsible
for myself and...

47:38.420 --> 47:40.640
I've quit on my own,
you know, so...

47:40.683 --> 47:42.816
I got five days now.

47:44.426 --> 47:46.689
I feel like I'm doing well,
but I just need, um...

47:46.733 --> 47:49.867
I just need
a few hundred bucks, though.

47:49.910 --> 47:51.607
Nic, I can't give you
any money.

47:53.609 --> 47:55.568
Yeah.

47:55.611 --> 47:57.831
Okay.

47:57.875 --> 47:59.572
It's just 200 bucks.
I just need, um...

47:59.615 --> 48:01.139
I just need to get
some shit together.

48:01.182 --> 48:02.444
I want to go to New York.

48:02.488 --> 48:04.751
- New York?
- Yeah.

48:04.794 --> 48:06.622
I need to get out
of San Francisco.

48:06.666 --> 48:08.320
There's too many...

48:08.363 --> 48:10.235
All these
fucking bad vibes here

48:10.278 --> 48:13.194
all the time.

48:13.238 --> 48:15.109
Yeah, I just need
a few hundred bucks.

48:15.153 --> 48:17.503
Why don't we just have lunch
and talk?

48:17.546 --> 48:20.071
- We can do that, right?
- Mm.

48:20.114 --> 48:21.681
Hmm.

48:26.077 --> 48:28.775
How... how's Karen
and, uh... and the kids?

48:28.818 --> 48:32.213
Okay. They ask about you.

48:32.257 --> 48:35.129
It's their step-up next week,
and I know they'd love you...

48:35.173 --> 48:37.044
Dad, you're, uh... you're
guilt-tripping me, all right?

48:37.088 --> 48:38.567
No, I'm just saying...

48:38.611 --> 48:40.874
I should feel horrible
about myself.

48:42.397 --> 48:47.011
I know they wanted you
to be there, that's all.

48:47.054 --> 48:48.708
I'm sorry, Dad.

48:48.751 --> 48:52.233
Um... I just need
some fucking money, all right?

48:52.277 --> 48:53.713
So please just give me
some fucking money.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.019
And then what?
Where does this end?

48:55.062 --> 48:56.585
This is... I got
to see this one through.

48:56.629 --> 48:58.196
This is kind of working out
for me right now.

48:58.239 --> 48:59.501
- I got five days sober.
- It doesn't look

48:59.545 --> 49:00.763
like it's working out, Nic.

49:00.807 --> 49:01.939
Oh, it doesn't look
like it's working out?

49:01.982 --> 49:02.852
- So what, then,
therapy? Huh? -No.

49:02.896 --> 49:04.289
- You can come home.
- No.

49:04.332 --> 49:05.768
- That wouldn't...
- We'll make it work. Please.

49:05.812 --> 49:07.292
Nic.

49:08.510 --> 49:10.338
Please.

49:17.128 --> 49:19.695
- I've been doing some research.
- Been doing fucking research?

49:19.739 --> 49:21.741
- You got to be kidding me, Dad.
- No...

49:21.784 --> 49:23.743
You think that you have this
under control.

49:23.786 --> 49:26.876
- Mm-hmm. -And I understand
how scared you are.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.878
I understand why I do things...
it doesn't make me

49:28.922 --> 49:31.403
any different, all right?
I'm attracted to craziness.

49:31.446 --> 49:33.405
And you're just embarrassed,
'cause I was, like, you know...

49:33.448 --> 49:34.667
I was, like,
this amazing thing,

49:34.710 --> 49:36.625
like, your special creation
or something,

49:36.669 --> 49:39.019
- and you don't like who I am now.
- Yeah?

49:39.063 --> 49:40.760
- Who are you, Nic?
- This is me, Dad.

49:40.803 --> 49:42.805
Here. This is who I am.

49:50.074 --> 49:52.163
You don't like what you see?

49:58.604 --> 50:02.869
You know,
the more I think about it...

50:02.912 --> 50:05.132
Mom should've gotten custody.

50:05.176 --> 50:07.700
Because you always
gotta be fucking

50:07.743 --> 50:09.571
controlling everything
all the time.

50:09.615 --> 50:12.139
You're allowed to be mad
at me, Nic. I made mistakes.

50:12.183 --> 50:15.055
I understand that. I wish
that I hadn't, but I did.

50:15.099 --> 50:17.884
But, God,
what you're saying right now

50:17.927 --> 50:20.930
- doesn't make any sense.
- You're doing this right now!

50:20.974 --> 50:22.671
- You're fucking controlling me right now!
- It's not you.

50:22.715 --> 50:24.543
It is not you, Nic.
It is the drugs talking.

50:24.586 --> 50:25.718
What does that
even fucking mean, huh?

50:25.761 --> 50:27.154
Psychological terror.

50:27.198 --> 50:28.721
- It's what addicts do.
- What the fuck

50:28.764 --> 50:30.027
are you doing right now, huh?

50:30.070 --> 50:32.942
What is this?
What are you doing, huh?

50:40.994 --> 50:42.996
Oh, man.

50:46.086 --> 50:49.046
I didn't want it to go
like this.

50:52.788 --> 50:54.355
All right.

50:54.399 --> 50:56.053
I should go, Dad.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.451
- Let me... let me book you a room.
- No, Dad.

51:03.495 --> 51:06.193
- At a hotel for a couple of nights.
- No. Dad...

51:06.237 --> 51:09.457
- Why don't we just go get some food?
- Dad, I should go.

51:11.024 --> 51:12.286
Can you say good-bye, at least?

51:12.330 --> 51:13.853
Bye, Dad.

51:25.604 --> 51:27.562
Where does he sleep?

51:27.606 --> 51:30.130
Um, don't worry
about that, sweetie.

51:30.174 --> 51:31.305
He's fine.

51:36.354 --> 51:38.747
Um...

51:38.791 --> 51:41.576
maybe he has a friend
and he sleeps there.

51:41.620 --> 51:45.319
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe.
- Dolphin.

51:45.363 --> 51:47.104
- Hope so.
- Need "E."

51:47.147 --> 51:48.496
Elephant.

51:48.540 --> 51:50.672
- Can I call him?
- Hmm.

51:50.716 --> 51:52.457
No. I tried.

51:52.500 --> 51:55.547
- His phone's disconnected.
- Can I send him a message?

51:55.590 --> 51:59.899
Maybe he'll get lonely
and turn his phone back on?

51:59.942 --> 52:02.336
That's a good idea.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.338
Yeah. Let's try that.

52:58.479 --> 53:00.177
Dave.

53:00.220 --> 53:02.527
- Yeah?
- Okay. Let's go.

53:06.270 --> 53:08.228
Hey, Dave, close your eyes.

53:08.272 --> 53:09.795
Okay.

53:13.277 --> 53:15.235
And... open 'em!

53:16.584 --> 53:18.282
Oh. Wow.

53:18.325 --> 53:19.718
Wow!

54:17.950 --> 54:19.647
Hello?

54:19.691 --> 54:22.476
This is Julie Ford at the
Bellevue Hospital in New York.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.348
Is Nic Sheff your son?

54:27.916 --> 54:29.440
Uh, Mr. Sheff,

54:29.483 --> 54:31.920
I'm sorry
we missed each other earlier.

54:31.964 --> 54:35.097
So, Nic is still experiencing
some respiratory depression,

54:35.141 --> 54:37.012
but his vital signs
are returning.

54:37.056 --> 54:39.406
Sir, we're ready for departure.

54:39.450 --> 54:40.929
Okay, okay.

54:40.973 --> 54:43.584
Um... may I talk to him?

54:43.628 --> 54:46.021
- No, that won't be possible.
- Sir, I need you to turn off

54:46.065 --> 54:47.675
- the phone. -Believe me,
we shouldn't wake him up.

54:47.719 --> 54:49.590
- Mm-hmm. -Try again
in a few hours, though, okay?

54:49.634 --> 54:52.593
- Okay. Uh, would you let him
know that... -Sir. Sir.

54:52.637 --> 54:56.031
- Please. -Would you please let
him know that I'm on my way?

55:04.431 --> 55:05.606
He checked out.

55:05.650 --> 55:06.868
What?

55:06.912 --> 55:08.348
Against doctor's orders.

55:08.392 --> 55:10.437
- No, no, he O.D.'d.
- I'm sorry, sir.

55:10.481 --> 55:12.787
He pulled out the I.V.
and catheter, and left.

55:12.831 --> 55:14.223
How long ago?

55:14.267 --> 55:16.704
Ten to 15 minutes.

55:16.748 --> 55:19.141
I'm sorry, sir.

55:42.817 --> 55:44.776
Yes.

56:05.449 --> 56:07.494
Look, I've thought about it,

56:07.538 --> 56:09.409
and I'm done with drugs.

56:09.453 --> 56:11.542
This is it.

56:13.935 --> 56:16.329
I'm telling you, Dad.

56:16.373 --> 56:18.331
I'm done.

56:28.515 --> 56:30.909
And how would that work?

56:30.952 --> 56:34.434
I mean,
after what just happened.

56:49.667 --> 56:51.799
Now, if you're in the area,

56:51.843 --> 56:53.410
evacuation orders and details,

56:53.453 --> 56:55.716
including relocation centers,
can be found on...

56:55.760 --> 56:58.110
So, at 3:00,
we have a conference call

56:58.153 --> 56:59.720
with the intake people
in Mississippi.

56:59.764 --> 57:01.069
That's all for now.

57:01.113 --> 57:02.723
3:30, the one in New Mexico.

57:02.767 --> 57:04.725
And 4:00, the one in Oregon.

57:04.769 --> 57:07.467
I did some research
on the one in New Mexico.

57:07.511 --> 57:10.818
Mm-hmm.
- They charge $40,000 a month.

57:10.862 --> 57:12.429
You know,
it's not even that well rated.

57:12.472 --> 57:14.518
We'll just skip that one.

57:14.561 --> 57:17.303
Listen, if a spot
opens up here in Los Angeles,

57:17.346 --> 57:19.523
maybe that's the best solution
for now.

57:19.566 --> 57:22.526
- I'll hear back from them
in an hour. -Mm.

57:23.788 --> 57:25.746
Give it a rest, David.

57:25.790 --> 57:27.922
Why don't you let me
take over for now?

57:33.275 --> 57:34.799
Mm.

57:34.842 --> 57:36.627
Dad?

57:36.670 --> 57:38.455
Yeah.

57:38.498 --> 57:42.415
Will you check on me
every 15 minutes?

57:42.459 --> 57:44.809
Yes.

58:22.368 --> 58:24.675
Do you want to bring
one of your dinosaurs, too?

58:27.765 --> 58:29.549
How about a book?

58:31.246 --> 58:33.771
No? Okay.

58:41.300 --> 58:42.997
Hey. Hey.

58:45.304 --> 58:47.393
Can I have a hug?

58:47.436 --> 58:48.481
No?

58:48.525 --> 58:50.048
Why not?

58:50.091 --> 58:52.572
Are you mad at me?

58:52.616 --> 58:54.748
'Cause you have to go?

58:55.749 --> 58:57.403
Okay.

58:57.446 --> 59:01.276
Well... you'll be happy
to see Mommy, though, right?

59:03.322 --> 59:05.280
I want you to know something.

59:05.324 --> 59:07.718
When you come back,
I'm gonna be here...

59:07.761 --> 59:10.851
right... I'm gonna be
right here for you.

59:10.895 --> 59:12.636
Okay?

59:12.679 --> 59:15.856
And call me when you miss me,
and I'll call you.

59:17.118 --> 59:19.556
Do you know
how much I love you?

59:26.519 --> 59:30.654
If you could take all the words
in the language,

59:30.697 --> 59:33.831
it still wouldn't describe
how much I love you.

59:33.874 --> 59:37.095
And if you could gather
all those words together,

59:37.138 --> 59:39.880
it still wouldn't describe
what I feel for you.

59:39.924 --> 59:42.883
What I feel for you
is everything.

59:44.711 --> 59:47.584
I love you
more than everything.

59:49.281 --> 59:51.631
Everything?

59:51.675 --> 59:53.328
Yeah, everything.

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:27.493
Hey.

01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.713
That's my mom.

01:00:29.756 --> 01:00:32.716
I'm really glad
you came to I.A.

01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.631
You know that, right?

01:00:40.506 --> 01:00:42.682
You just don't know
what it is to be...

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.684
- Please don't do this, Mom.
- Okay.

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:46.904
I'm sorry. Okay.

01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:56.174
All I could think about
was you.

01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:04.530
I know this must sound
meaningless, but I'm sorry.

01:01:08.055 --> 01:01:10.275
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:13.408
Oh, Nicky.

01:01:19.153 --> 01:01:21.678
You are such a darling.

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:23.680
You know that, right?

01:01:28.032 --> 01:01:30.164
Whew.

01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:46.180
Hey, come on, old man!

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:48.443
- You're being so disrespectful.
- I'm not being disrespectful.

01:01:48.487 --> 01:01:50.750
You're being so disrespectful.

01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:54.406
- I'm coming for you!
- Oh, motherfucker!

01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:57.365
Uh-huh. You about
to look at my ass, baby!

01:01:57.409 --> 01:01:59.672
You about to look at my ass!

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.074
Fuck.

01:02:33.184 --> 01:02:34.663
That's what I get for helping.

01:02:34.707 --> 01:02:36.491
Why'd you pull that hard?

01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:38.885
- I'm sorry.
- Why do you hate me?

01:02:54.596 --> 01:02:56.598
How does this feel?

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:04.128
Like I'm a real human being.

01:03:12.092 --> 01:03:15.661
One day,
I tried methamphetamine...

01:03:15.704 --> 01:03:18.142
Yeah. That felt good.

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:20.666
...and I thought,

01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:23.103
"This is what's been missing."

01:03:23.147 --> 01:03:25.802
I felt complete.

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:27.847
Today's a good day.

01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:30.719
Yeah, I've been
chasing that high

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:32.721
ever since.

01:03:32.765 --> 01:03:34.723
No matter...

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:36.725
how much meth...

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:40.686
or whatever else I can find
to shoot up into my body...

01:03:40.729 --> 01:03:43.167
I do, it's never enough.

01:03:46.474 --> 01:03:49.869
And I went
to a couple of rehabs,

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.479
I detoxed,

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:54.265
they would talk
about disease, sure,

01:03:54.308 --> 01:03:55.875
but...

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.616
it never clicked.

01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:04.710
Until one day
I woke up in a hospital

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:08.018
and someone asked me,

01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:10.498
"What's your problem?"

01:04:13.327 --> 01:04:16.548
And I said, "I'm an alcoholic
and an addict."

01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:18.376
And he said...

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:21.596
"No, that's how you've
been treating your problem."

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.598
Mm-hmm.
- That's right.

01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:27.037
I know now I need to find a way

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.344
to fill this...

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:32.477
big...

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.783
black hole in me.

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:40.877
Anyway, so...

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.010
I'm 14 months clean.

01:04:44.054 --> 01:04:46.230
I have a job at a rehab.

01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:50.016
It's fulfilling
to help other people get sober.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.717
I have a sponsor, Spencer.

01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:58.590
Shows me how great
my life can be sober.

01:05:00.026 --> 01:05:02.420
And, um, I still have family.

01:05:04.422 --> 01:05:07.207
My mom's been amazing.

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:10.080
My dad's been amazing, too.

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:18.262
I want them to be proud of me.

01:05:57.562 --> 01:06:00.217
You all right?

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.393
What's wrong? You nervous?

01:06:02.436 --> 01:06:03.698
Yeah.

01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:12.620
Thank you for marrying me.

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:16.015
Thank you for being
a perfect partner

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:18.061
in an imperfect world.

01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:22.543
Thank you for introducing me
to your amazing son.

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.634
Uh, I'm here for you,

01:06:26.678 --> 01:06:27.984
and I'm here to stay.

01:06:28.027 --> 01:06:30.073
Karen, thank you...

01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:32.118
for loving me.

01:06:33.424 --> 01:06:35.165
And thank you for loving him.

01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:47.699
Looks him square in the eye,
and he says, "Superman..."

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:52.704
Perfect.

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:14.595
- Hey, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:17.076
Hey, Daisy. Hey, Daisy!

01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:22.125
Hey, Jazzy Jeff.

01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:24.170
What's going on, man?

01:07:24.214 --> 01:07:25.780
Hey, man, I miss you more

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:28.827
than the sun misses
the moon at night.

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:30.829
Mm.

01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:34.180
- Hey, Karen.
- Hey.

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.622
Thank you for inviting me.

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:43.276
Seriously.

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.569
Go, Daisy! Go, Daisy!
Go, Daisy! Go, Daisy!

01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:17.049
Go, Daisy!

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.616
Hey, honey.

01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:24.187
Go, Daisy, go!

01:08:33.892 --> 01:08:36.242
Nice.

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:41.595
Oh! Ah, you!

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:43.466
It's Daisy!

01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:47.732
Whoa!

01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:57.959
"If the marker is depleted

01:08:58.002 --> 01:08:59.917
"in meth addicts' brains,

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:02.660
"it's likely there is
a loss of nerve terminals

01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:05.184
"and the brain damage
is irreversible.

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:07.665
"However,
when I tested for VMAT2,

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:10.711
- I found normal levels."
- So that's optimistic.

01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:13.236
- Normal levels is optimistic, yeah.
- It's...

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.671
- It is.
- Okay.

01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:16.238
- No. I'm not...
- I was just checking.

01:09:16.282 --> 01:09:17.761
- No, no, that's good.
- Okay.

01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:19.067
Basically...

01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:20.417
the fried...

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.462
Nic's fried nerve endings

01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:24.943
can grow back.

01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:27.162
They say it can take
two years, but...

01:09:27.206 --> 01:09:29.381
- Two years?
- Yeah.

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:31.950
But that's great, David.

01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:43.962
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:44.005 --> 01:09:47.095
- You're kind of late.
- Yeah. It was a great meeting,

01:09:47.139 --> 01:09:49.272
and after, we went
to the speaker's house

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:51.229
and watched a video and...

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:55.234
saw my sober sponsee bros
earlier, so...

01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:57.280
No phone?

01:09:57.323 --> 01:09:59.325
Oh, my cell was dead.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:05.418
Would you be okay
to do a drug test?

01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:08.682
Yeah, I mean, sure.

01:10:08.726 --> 01:10:10.249
Okay.

01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:30.269
You understand why, right?

01:10:30.313 --> 01:10:34.621
Yeah. I mean, I should've
called to let you know, so...

01:10:34.665 --> 01:10:38.538
I trust you... we just need
to have some sort of proof.

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:44.892
That's about as contradictory
as it gets.

01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:47.243
- But...
- I know. I know.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:51.508
I'll do it. No worries.

01:10:51.551 --> 01:10:53.901
Nothing to hide.

01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:56.382
Okay.

01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:01.257
Hey, you're doing great.

01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:04.564
You really are.

01:11:04.608 --> 01:11:07.611
By my count, 485 days clean.

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:09.743
Wow. Come on, that's...

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.446
I'll just leave it
in the bathroom, right? Okay.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.057
All right.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.059
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:23.191
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:56.573
- All right, Jasper, you ready?
- Yep.

01:11:56.616 --> 01:11:58.749
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:00.968
Hey. No, no, no, wait.

01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:04.145
- Jasper, I don't want you
to go out there. -What?

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:05.930
Mom, we won't go far, I swear!

01:12:05.973 --> 01:12:07.758
The waves are too big.
It's too dangerous.

01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:08.976
But I am a great swimmer.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.282
I've been in waves
way bigger than this.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.197
Yes, I know that,
but I don't want you to...

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.720
- Yeah, I'll stay close.
- Nic will stay close,

01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:16.375
you see?

01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:18.116
Karen, I'm gonna stay...

01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:20.031
- I'll stay close.
- Nic can go in.

01:12:20.074 --> 01:12:21.206
That's fine. You, no.

01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:23.121
And that is final.

01:12:23.164 --> 01:12:24.601
We'll see about that.

01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:27.343
- Hey!
- Okay. It's fine.

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:29.649
It's fine.

01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:40.138
Should we just play a game
instead?

01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:42.401
- Uh...
- Yeah?

01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:47.101
Are you a hurfboard?

01:12:47.145 --> 01:12:49.495
- No.
- No?

01:12:49.539 --> 01:12:51.497
Are you a hicycle?

01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:53.369
- No.
- No?

01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:55.675
Okay. Uh, are you edible?

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.242
Not really.

01:12:57.285 --> 01:12:59.375
- Not really?
- Not really.

01:12:59.418 --> 01:13:00.941
So, sort of.

01:13:00.985 --> 01:13:03.204
So, um...

01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:04.989
are you a house?

01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:08.122
Yes. How did you know?

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.863
You know,

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:12.300
I can read your mind.

01:13:12.344 --> 01:13:15.129
- Ooh...
- Ooh...

01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:18.132
I know you're a great swimmer.

01:13:18.176 --> 01:13:20.134
I'm gonna be there to cheer
for you at your next swim meet.

01:13:20.178 --> 01:13:21.222
How does that sound?

01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:22.789
Yeah?

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:25.226
Okay.

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:27.620
Hey, is it weird to see me
after all this time?

01:13:27.664 --> 01:13:28.621
Or no?

01:13:28.665 --> 01:13:30.406
I guess it was, at first.

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:33.496
- Okay. -I thought
you might be different.

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:36.803
But you're just
the same old Nic.

01:13:59.347 --> 01:14:02.481
- That was a great weekend.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:58.537
Go, Nic!

01:15:25.956 --> 01:15:28.524
Bye, Nic! Bye, Nic!

01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:30.787
Bye, Nic!

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:55.594
One day at a time, man.

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.204
Congratulations.
Welcome to the real world.

01:15:57.248 --> 01:15:59.076
Oh, I don't want to live
in the real world.

01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:00.730
I'm so sick of living in it.

01:16:00.773 --> 01:16:02.253
- -That's your disease
talking to you, man.

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:03.776
- Oh, I'm trying.
- By trying to isolate you.

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.386
Trying to kill you.
You know this, man.

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.258
I don't feel like
I have a disease, Spencer.

01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:09.086
I feel like...

01:16:09.129 --> 01:16:12.176
- Well, you got to. -This isn't
like fucking cancer.

01:16:12.219 --> 01:16:15.527
This is my fucking choice.
I put myself here.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:17.181
Yeah, you did.
You did put yourself there.

01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:18.922
Are you gonna let me talk
or what?

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.925
Okay? Like, you're a writer,
right? So write.

01:16:21.968 --> 01:16:24.275
You're good at it. This is
your day. This is a choice.

01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:26.016
- What do you want to do now?
- Fucking...

01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:27.757
Once you get high,
you lose all your choices.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.541
- If you get high,
you lose everything. -Right.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:32.413
All right, so you got
to keep choosing the right way.

01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:36.940
- Right.
- That's right.

01:16:36.983 --> 01:16:38.768
You choose the right way.

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:40.291
Right. All right, hey, listen,

01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:41.814
I'm gonna give you
a call later, all right?

01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:43.337
Uh, I-I feel
like I'm gonna do all right.

01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:44.643
You blowing me off now?

01:16:44.687 --> 01:16:46.297
You gonna call me
and waste my time?

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.081
Don't waste my time.
I'm here for you, man.

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:49.648
You know what, look,
I'm having some steaks tonight.

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:50.823
Why don't you come over
for dinner.

01:16:50.867 --> 01:16:52.085
- All right, I'll see you then.
- You...

01:16:52.129 --> 01:16:53.521
That sounds great.
I'll see you then.

01:16:53.565 --> 01:16:55.001
- Yo, Nic, Nic.
- Yes, sir. I'll see you then.

01:16:55.045 --> 01:16:57.134
- Nic...
- All right, bye-bye.

01:17:54.147 --> 01:17:56.193
Nic Sheff.

01:17:56.236 --> 01:17:58.195
Lauren. What?

01:17:58.238 --> 01:18:00.458
What are you...

01:18:02.329 --> 01:18:04.027
Wow, it's been a long time.

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:05.550
What-what are you doing here?

01:18:05.593 --> 01:18:08.118
Just, uh...

01:18:09.989 --> 01:18:12.296
What?

01:18:15.473 --> 01:18:17.040
I've been sober for a while,

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:20.130
but I'm seriously looking
to party right now.

01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:46.156
I got what you need.
We have E, we have pills, man.

01:18:46.199 --> 01:18:48.245
We have E.
I told you, I told you.

01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:58.995
Can you get me
a cup of water and a spoon?

01:18:59.038 --> 01:19:00.431
Mm-hmm.

01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:02.825
All right.

01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:21.365
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

01:19:21.408 --> 01:19:24.020
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:19:25.021 --> 01:19:27.240
Cotton and a spoon.

01:19:50.002 --> 01:19:52.831
Mmm.

01:20:03.537 --> 01:20:05.757
All right, that's it.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.759
That's it.

01:20:17.464 --> 01:20:19.423
Wow.

01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:40.825
Your call has been forwarded

01:22:40.868 --> 01:22:42.827
to an automated
voice messaging system.

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:44.698
At the tone,
please record your message.

01:22:46.048 --> 01:22:47.658
It's Dad again.

01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:49.703
I feel like you might
have been a little down

01:22:49.747 --> 01:22:52.619
when you left, Nic, so I'm here
to talk if you need to.

01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:55.318
All right.

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.941
So you have no idea
where he is?

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.509
Uh, Spencer told me
he heard from him.

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:15.512
He was having a difficult time,
but he was pulling through.

01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:19.255
But, yeah, he's not at work,
he's not at home.

01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:21.648
- He's unreachable on his cell.
- Damn it. Damn it. Vicki,

01:23:21.692 --> 01:23:24.651
he left here two days ago.
Why didn't you check on him?

01:23:24.695 --> 01:23:27.045
You're supposed to be taking
care of this kid, right?

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:28.655
What the fuck, David?

01:23:28.699 --> 01:23:30.962
Who's been taking care of him
the last year?

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.572
Well, you could've checked
on him.

01:23:32.616 --> 01:23:34.313
I mean, what the fuck
is your problem?

01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:36.881
What do you think I do all day?

01:23:36.924 --> 01:23:40.276
Besides, we can't run
surveillance on him 24/7.

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:43.279
I think you need to go
to the police right now

01:23:43.322 --> 01:23:45.281
and file a missing persons
report, okay?

01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:47.239
- Stop yelling at me!
- No, I'm not gonna stop

01:23:47.283 --> 01:23:49.546
- yelling at you, Vicki.
- I hate it when you do that.

01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:50.982
- Because you're just...
- You're totally crazy.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.418
What are you even doing there?!

01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:54.290
- Fucking unfair, David!
- No, no! Listen to me!

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:56.335
What are...

01:23:57.336 --> 01:23:59.643
Damn.

01:23:59.686 --> 01:24:02.167
Fuck!

01:24:08.739 --> 01:24:10.436
Dave?

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.222
Could you call my phone,
please?

01:24:16.225 --> 01:24:18.096
What's going on?

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.011
He's gone.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.407
How do we even know
he's in I.A.?

01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:27.062
I mean, he could be in
San Francisco. He could be...

01:24:27.105 --> 01:24:29.499
he could be in fucking Mexico,
for all we know.

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:31.109
I need to go.

01:24:31.153 --> 01:24:33.851
Yeah, but I need you to stay.

01:24:33.894 --> 01:24:35.679
Well, Vicki can't handle it
like I...

01:24:35.722 --> 01:24:38.029
I don't care about Vicki.
This isn't about Vicki.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:41.685
Okay, why don't you just relax
and try to be reasonable.

01:24:41.728 --> 01:24:43.948
- What? You be reasonable.
- I am being reasonable.

01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:44.992
Is this reasonable?!

01:24:45.036 --> 01:24:47.604
No! It's not!

01:24:47.647 --> 01:24:49.040
How can I be?!

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.607
My son is out there somewhere,

01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:52.261
and I don't know
what he's doing!

01:24:52.304 --> 01:24:53.871
I don't know how to help him!

01:24:53.914 --> 01:24:56.352
You can't!

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.581
I can't sleep.

01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:13.586
You can't sleep?

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.153
I can't sleep.

01:25:15.197 --> 01:25:16.415
Okay.

01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:22.595
Good night, Daddy.

01:25:23.596 --> 01:25:25.163
Good night.

01:26:02.592 --> 01:26:04.289
Let go!

01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:05.986
Airplane flying!

01:26:11.078 --> 01:26:13.037
Fly away! Fly!

01:27:20.626 --> 01:27:22.411
No. Uh-uh. Come on, not
you. Come on. -DAVID: Hold on.

01:27:22.454 --> 01:27:24.195
- Get back in. Guys, come on.
- Hold on. Hold on, honey.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.979
- Wait.
- Good dog.

01:27:27.894 --> 01:27:31.158
I thought
Nic was gonna be here today.

01:27:31.202 --> 01:27:33.465
Uh, no. Something came up.

01:27:34.466 --> 01:27:36.599
Can I call him?

01:27:36.642 --> 01:27:38.601
No, no. You can't.

01:27:38.644 --> 01:27:40.211
It's not gonna be possible.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.299
Why not?

01:27:41.343 --> 01:27:43.301
Because it's not.

01:27:43.345 --> 01:27:46.130
Is Nic back on drugs again?

01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:31.496
All right.

01:31:12.728 --> 01:31:15.121
Come on, Jasper!
Whup.

01:31:26.568 --> 01:31:28.570
Yup.

01:31:52.071 --> 01:31:53.159
You got it?

01:31:53.203 --> 01:31:55.292
Oh, fuck. Okay.
Hey, Lauren.

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:58.251
- Lauren, let's go.
- What?

01:31:58.295 --> 01:31:59.862
We got to go.

01:32:01.559 --> 01:32:03.474
- What's going on?
- Here.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:06.172
We got to go.

01:32:06.216 --> 01:32:08.218
Fine.

01:32:21.623 --> 01:32:24.234
I think I just saw Nic.

01:32:24.277 --> 01:32:26.018
What?

01:32:26.062 --> 01:32:29.195
I think I just saw Nic
and a girl running away.

01:32:35.941 --> 01:32:37.508
Nic.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:38.988
Uh, no. Stay inside.

01:32:39.031 --> 01:32:40.816
- Okay.
- No.

01:32:40.859 --> 01:32:44.689
All right, no. Stay inside!
I am not kidding, all right?

01:32:44.733 --> 01:32:46.561
Stay there.

01:32:49.651 --> 01:32:51.609
Okay.

01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:54.264
- Shit.
- Never again.

01:32:54.307 --> 01:32:56.571
- It's okay. Hey.
- What do we do? What do we do?

01:32:56.614 --> 01:32:58.007
It's all right.

01:33:02.968 --> 01:33:05.144
That was so terrible.

01:33:05.188 --> 01:33:08.365
Oh, fuck!

01:33:12.804 --> 01:33:15.198
Nic? Nic? Nic!

01:33:16.895 --> 01:33:18.288
Oh...

01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:32.389
Oh. No. No. No.

01:34:48.508 --> 01:34:51.294
Come on!

01:35:18.756 --> 01:35:21.977
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:35:46.044 --> 01:35:47.785
Okay. Okay.

01:35:50.048 --> 01:35:51.789
911. What is your emergency?

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.791
Yeah. Hi. Uh, I got a f...
I'm-I'm with a friend.

01:35:53.835 --> 01:35:55.140
She just O.D.'d, and, uh,

01:35:55.184 --> 01:35:56.794
I need an ambulance,
I need some help.

01:35:56.838 --> 01:35:58.187
Sir, do you know CPR?

01:35:58.230 --> 01:35:59.754
Yeah, I'm doing it right now.
I just...

01:35:59.797 --> 01:36:01.886
Uh, we... You-you guys,
you got to send an ambulance,

01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:04.106
- too, all right?
- What is your location?

01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:06.151
Yeah, I don't know.

01:36:06.195 --> 01:36:07.805
Y-You-you guys are gonna have
to trace the call.

01:36:07.849 --> 01:36:09.589
Hello?

01:36:09.633 --> 01:36:13.028
Hello?
Sir, are you still there?

01:36:13.071 --> 01:36:15.378
Sir?

01:36:18.294 --> 01:36:19.817
Sir? Sir?

01:36:28.739 --> 01:36:31.698
Look up.

01:36:31.742 --> 01:36:33.439
Honey, look up for me.

01:36:34.919 --> 01:36:38.314
Can you look up this way
over here?

01:36:38.357 --> 01:36:40.446
Hey, look, we're gonna need
to take you to the ER.

01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:41.883
I-I don't...
I don't want to. I-I...

01:36:41.926 --> 01:36:43.493
- We need to take you to the ER.
- I'm fine.

01:36:43.536 --> 01:36:44.842
She doesn't want to go
to the ER. She's...

01:36:44.886 --> 01:36:46.496
She's... No, she's not okay.
We need to take her

01:36:46.539 --> 01:36:47.889
- to the ER.
- But she doesn't want to go.

01:36:47.932 --> 01:36:49.629
No, sir, she needs to go!

01:36:49.673 --> 01:36:51.327
Okay?

01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:53.851
You have a problem with that,
I can inform the police.

01:36:53.895 --> 01:36:55.635
Goddamn it.

01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:59.117
You're gonna come
and meet me, right?

01:36:59.161 --> 01:37:00.597
- Yes. Yes!
- You promise?

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.034
I love you.

01:37:03.078 --> 01:37:05.515
I love you, too.

01:37:05.558 --> 01:37:07.212
- You promise you're gonna meet me?
- Yes, Lauren.

01:37:07.256 --> 01:37:09.301
I'll come fucking meet you.
What do you want from me?

01:37:09.345 --> 01:37:12.609
- Okay, okay.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:41.333
David Sheff.

01:37:41.377 --> 01:37:43.118
Hey, Dad. It's me.

01:37:45.816 --> 01:37:48.297
- Nic?
- Yeah.

01:37:57.567 --> 01:37:59.612
Please don't hate me, Dad.

01:38:01.136 --> 01:38:03.138
I know I did wrong.

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:06.924
I want to stop,
but please, please, please,

01:38:06.968 --> 01:38:08.795
please, please,
please no rehab, all right?

01:38:08.839 --> 01:38:11.668
Just let me come home.
You know what?

01:38:11.711 --> 01:38:15.498
I realize it's actually
I... I-I need to be home.

01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:20.285
You guys, you guys are gonna
give me the strength to stop.

01:38:20.329 --> 01:38:22.331
All right?

01:38:25.203 --> 01:38:27.205
That's not going to happen.

01:38:36.475 --> 01:38:39.565
I wish that I could help you,

01:38:39.609 --> 01:38:41.567
but I can't do that.

01:38:41.611 --> 01:38:43.352
I c... I can't.

01:38:43.395 --> 01:38:45.484
Oh, please help me, Dad.

01:38:46.964 --> 01:38:49.184
No, Dad. I just need
a little bit of help.

01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:53.318
Please help me.
I want to come home.

01:38:53.362 --> 01:38:56.060
All I can tell you
is what you already know.

01:38:56.104 --> 01:38:58.541
Dad, why aren't you
fucking listening to me?

01:38:58.584 --> 01:39:00.717
- Call your sponsor.
- I don't want to talk

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.632
to my sponsor now.
I want to talk to you.

01:39:02.675 --> 01:39:04.590
Get help.

01:39:04.634 --> 01:39:06.549
- I love you.
- Dad, what...

01:39:06.592 --> 01:39:08.986
And I hope that you get
your life together.

01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:10.596
I love you, too.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.121
I love you.

01:41:41.182 --> 01:41:44.010
- Hello.
- Nicolas called.

01:41:44.054 --> 01:41:45.447
He sounds desperate.

01:41:46.752 --> 01:41:48.667
Gonna die
if we don't do anything.

01:41:48.711 --> 01:41:50.713
Well...

01:41:50.756 --> 01:41:53.672
he's gonna die even if we do.

01:41:53.716 --> 01:41:56.371
Nothing we do
has any effect on him.

01:42:02.333 --> 01:42:03.900
I failed.

01:42:03.943 --> 01:42:05.554
I know you feel ashamed, okay?

01:42:05.597 --> 01:42:08.209
So do I.

01:42:08.252 --> 01:42:10.559
But you have done great, David.

01:42:10.602 --> 01:42:13.518
And Karen, too,
so thank you for that.

01:42:13.562 --> 01:42:15.433
You were up for it
when I wasn't,

01:42:15.477 --> 01:42:17.348
and I'm not giving up now.

01:42:18.393 --> 01:42:20.221
Never.

01:42:21.918 --> 01:42:24.660
But I can't do it alone.

01:42:27.619 --> 01:42:30.405
I need your help.

01:42:32.668 --> 01:42:35.671
I don't think
you can save people, Vicki.

01:42:37.586 --> 01:42:40.980
You can be there
for them, can't you?

01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:46.986
Look at this.

01:42:52.122 --> 01:42:54.037
I'm done.

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.257
- Oh.
- Okay? I...

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.303
Okay.

01:43:32.945 --> 01:43:34.947
Hey, everybody.

01:43:34.991 --> 01:43:37.689
Time to get together.

01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:54.315
I... I had a rough week.

01:43:56.752 --> 01:43:58.493
Some of you know,
some of you don't.

01:43:58.536 --> 01:44:00.190
I, um...

01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:02.279
I lost my Frances this week.

01:44:02.323 --> 01:44:05.456
She died of an overdose
on Sunday.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.589
So...

01:44:07.632 --> 01:44:11.593
I guess I'm in mourning,
but I-I...

01:44:11.636 --> 01:44:14.030
I realized something else.

01:44:14.073 --> 01:44:18.121
I've actually been in mourning
for years.

01:44:20.210 --> 01:44:22.430
'Cause even when she was alive,
she...

01:44:22.473 --> 01:44:24.997
she wasn't there.

01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:29.306
When you mourn the living,

01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:32.222
that's a hard way to live.

01:44:34.224 --> 01:44:36.705
And so, in...

01:44:36.748 --> 01:44:38.968
in a way, it's-it's...

01:44:39.011 --> 01:44:41.100
it's better, I guess.

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:50.849
She was a dear,
dear young woman.

01:44:52.808 --> 01:44:54.984
I always felt...

01:44:55.027 --> 01:44:57.595
I needed to... to stay strong,

01:44:57.639 --> 01:45:01.033
that there'd be
some future event,

01:45:01.077 --> 01:45:03.688
and I'd... I'd need
all my strength for it.

01:45:07.301 --> 01:45:09.781
But there are no events
after this one.

01:45:09.825 --> 01:45:13.350
I hope she's not in pain now.

01:45:20.052 --> 01:45:22.054
Bye, Frances.

01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:21.435
Hey.

01:47:21.478 --> 01:47:23.654
Hi.

01:47:32.924 --> 01:47:34.491
How's he doing?

01:47:34.535 --> 01:47:36.754
The doctor's with him now.

01:47:38.364 --> 01:47:40.149
He said it's close to a miracle

01:47:40.192 --> 01:47:43.152
Nic survived
with all the drugs in his body.

01:54:42.876 --> 01:54:44.703
"Either peace or happiness,

01:54:44.747 --> 01:54:46.575
"let it enfold you.

01:54:46.618 --> 01:54:49.578
"When I was a young man,
I felt that these things

01:54:49.621 --> 01:54:52.059
"were dumb, unsophisticated.

01:54:52.102 --> 01:54:54.322
"I had bad blood,
a twisted mind,

01:54:54.365 --> 01:54:56.454
"a precarious upbringing.

01:54:56.498 --> 01:54:58.108
"I was hard as granite.

01:54:58.152 --> 01:55:00.023
"I leered at the sun.

01:55:00.067 --> 01:55:03.505
"I trusted no man
and especially no woman.

01:55:03.548 --> 01:55:05.899
"I was living a hell
in small rooms.

01:55:05.942 --> 01:55:07.639
"I broke things,
smashed things,

01:55:07.683 --> 01:55:10.251
"walked through glass, cursed.

01:55:10.294 --> 01:55:11.905
"I challenged everything,

01:55:11.948 --> 01:55:14.124
"was continually being evicted,
jailed,

01:55:14.168 --> 01:55:16.910
"in and out of fights,
in and out of my mind.

01:55:16.953 --> 01:55:19.347
"Women were something
to screw and rail at.

01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:21.479
"I had no male friends.

01:55:21.523 --> 01:55:23.612
"I changed jobs and cities.

01:55:23.655 --> 01:55:26.310
"I hated holidays,
babies, history,

01:55:26.354 --> 01:55:28.965
"newspapers, museums,
grandmothers,

01:55:29.009 --> 01:55:32.012
"marriage, movies, spiders,
garbagemen,

01:55:32.055 --> 01:55:35.929
"English accents, Spain,
France, Italy,

01:55:35.972 --> 01:55:38.670
"walnuts and the color orange.

01:55:38.714 --> 01:55:40.542
"Algebra angered me.

01:55:40.585 --> 01:55:42.500
"Opera sickened me.

01:55:42.544 --> 01:55:44.589
"Charlie Chaplin was a fake.

01:55:44.633 --> 01:55:46.765
"And flowers were for pansies.

01:55:46.809 --> 01:55:50.160
"Peace and happiness were to me
signs of inferiority,

01:55:50.204 --> 01:55:52.989
"tenants of the weak
and addled mind.

01:55:53.033 --> 01:55:55.600
"But as I went on
with my alley fights,

01:55:55.644 --> 01:55:57.167
"my suicidal years,

01:55:57.211 --> 01:55:59.126
"my passage through
any number of women,

01:55:59.169 --> 01:56:02.651
"it gradually began to occur
to me that I wasn't different

01:56:02.694 --> 01:56:04.740
"from the others,
I was the same.

01:56:04.783 --> 01:56:06.698
"They were all fulsome
with hatred,

01:56:06.742 --> 01:56:09.092
"glossed over
with petty grievances.

01:56:09.136 --> 01:56:11.747
"The men I fought in alleys
had hearts of stone.

01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:13.749
"Everybody was nudging,
inching,

01:56:13.792 --> 01:56:16.621
"cheating for some
insignificant advantage.

01:56:16.665 --> 01:56:19.798
"The lie was the weapon,
and the plot was empty.

01:56:19.842 --> 01:56:22.062
"Darkness was the dictator.

01:56:22.105 --> 01:56:25.500
"Cautiously, I allowed myself
to feel good at times.

01:56:25.543 --> 01:56:27.458
"I found moments of peace
in cheap rooms

01:56:27.502 --> 01:56:30.505
"just staring at the knobs
of some dresser

01:56:30.548 --> 01:56:32.855
"or listening
to the rain in the dark.

01:56:32.898 --> 01:56:35.858
"The less I needed,
the better I felt.

01:56:35.901 --> 01:56:37.773
"Maybe the other life
had worn me down.

01:56:37.816 --> 01:56:39.470
"I no longer found glamour

01:56:39.514 --> 01:56:41.864
"in topping somebody
in conversation

01:56:41.907 --> 01:56:45.128
"or in mounting the body
of some poor, drunken female

01:56:45.172 --> 01:56:47.652
"whose life had slipped away
into sorrow.

01:56:47.696 --> 01:56:49.611
"I could never accept
life as it was.

01:56:49.654 --> 01:56:52.440
"I could never gobble down
all its poisons.

01:56:52.483 --> 01:56:54.746
"But there were parts,
tenuous magic parts,

01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:56.748
"open for the asking.

01:56:56.792 --> 01:56:58.315
"I reformulated.

"I don't know when...
date, time, all that...

"but the change occurred.

"Something in me relaxed,
smoothed out.

"I no longer had to prove
that I was a man.

"I didn't have to prove
anything.

01:57:09.457 --> 01:57:11.198
"I began to see things.

01:57:11.241 --> 01:57:13.939
"Coffee cups lined up
behind a counter in a cafe.

01:57:13.983 --> 01:57:16.420
"Or a dog walking
along a sidewalk.

01:57:16.464 --> 01:57:18.379
"Or the way the mouse
on my dresser top

01:57:18.422 --> 01:57:20.424
"stopped there,
really stopped there,

01:57:20.468 --> 01:57:22.557
"with its body,
its ears, its nose.

01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:26.430
"It was fixed, a bit of life
caught within itself,

01:57:26.474 --> 01:57:30.260
"and its eyes looked at me,
and they were beautiful.

01:57:30.304 --> 01:57:32.349
"Then it was gone.

01:57:32.393 --> 01:57:34.221
"I began to feel good.

01:57:34.264 --> 01:57:36.745
"I began to feel good
in the worst situations,

01:57:36.788 --> 01:57:38.486
"and there were
plenty of those.

01:57:38.529 --> 01:57:41.532
"Like, say, the boss
behind his desk.

01:57:41.576 --> 01:57:43.665
"He is going to have
to fire me.

01:57:43.708 --> 01:57:45.449
"I've missed too many days.

01:57:45.493 --> 01:57:48.757
"He's dressed in a suit,
necktie, glasses.

01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:51.542
"He says, 'I am going
to have to let you go.'

01:57:51.586 --> 01:57:53.327
"'It's all right, '
I tell him.

01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:54.806
"He must do what he must do.

01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:56.765
"He has a wife,
a house, children,

01:57:56.808 --> 01:57:59.985
"expenses,
most probably a girlfriend.

01:58:00.029 --> 01:58:01.465
"I'm sorry for him.

01:58:01.509 --> 01:58:03.119
"He's caught.

01:58:03.163 --> 01:58:04.773
"I walk out into
the blazing sunshine.

01:58:04.816 --> 01:58:07.558
"The whole day is mine,
temporarily anyhow.

01:58:07.602 --> 01:58:10.170
"The whole world is at
the throat of the world.

01:58:10.213 --> 01:58:13.129
"Everybody feels angry,
short-changed, cheated.

01:58:13.173 --> 01:58:15.871
"Everybody is despondent,
disillusioned.

01:58:15.914 --> 01:58:19.048
"I welcomed shots of peace,
tattered shards of happiness.

01:58:19.092 --> 01:58:21.442
"I embraced that stuff
like the hottest number,

01:58:21.485 --> 01:58:24.358
"like high heels, breasts,
singing, the works.

01:58:24.401 --> 01:58:25.924
"Don't get me wrong,

01:58:25.968 --> 01:58:27.665
"there is such a thing
as cockeyed optimism

01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:29.102
"that overlooks
all basic problems

01:58:29.145 --> 01:58:30.581
"just for the sake of itself.

01:58:30.625 --> 01:58:32.844
"This is a shield
and a sickness.

01:58:32.888 --> 01:58:34.890
"The knife got near
my throat again.

01:58:34.933 --> 01:58:36.805
"I almost turned on
the gas again.

01:58:36.848 --> 01:58:38.807
"But when the good moments
arrived again,

01:58:38.850 --> 01:58:40.939
"I didn't fight them off
like an alley adversary.

01:58:40.983 --> 01:58:43.420
"I let them take me.
I luxuriated in them.

01:58:43.464 --> 01:58:45.248
"I bade them welcome home.

01:58:45.292 --> 01:58:46.902
"I even looked
into the mirror once

01:58:46.945 --> 01:58:49.948
"having thought myself
to be ugly.

01:58:49.992 --> 01:58:51.994
"I now liked what I saw.

01:58:52.037 --> 01:58:53.691
"Almost handsome.

01:58:53.735 --> 01:58:55.911
"Yes, a bit ripped and ragged.

01:58:55.954 --> 01:58:58.087
"Scars, lumps, odd turns.

01:58:58.131 --> 01:59:00.176
"But all in all, not too bad.

01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.047
"Almost handsome.

01:59:02.091 --> 01:59:04.137
"Better at least than some
of those movie star faces

01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:05.877
"like the cheeks
of a baby's butt.

01:59:05.921 --> 01:59:07.401
"And finally I discovered

01:59:07.444 --> 01:59:09.751
"real feelings for others,
unheralded.

01:59:09.794 --> 01:59:11.622
"Like lately,
like this morning,

01:59:11.666 --> 01:59:15.148
"as I was leaving for the
track, I saw my wife in bed,

01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:17.019
"just the shape
of her head there,

01:59:17.062 --> 01:59:20.631
"covers pulled high, just
the shape of her head there.

01:59:20.675 --> 01:59:23.068
"Not forgetting centuries
of the living and the dead

01:59:23.112 --> 01:59:24.896
"and the dying, the pyramids,

01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:27.421
"Mozart dead, but his music
still there in the room,

01:59:27.464 --> 01:59:29.205
"weeds growing,
the Earth turning,

01:59:29.249 --> 01:59:31.338
"the tote board waiting for me.

01:59:31.381 --> 01:59:33.122
"I saw the shape
of my wife's head,

01:59:33.166 --> 01:59:34.558
"she so still.

01:59:34.602 --> 01:59:36.081
"I ached for her life,

01:59:36.125 --> 01:59:37.779
"just being there
under the covers.

01:59:37.822 --> 01:59:39.346
"I kissed her on the forehead,

01:59:39.389 --> 01:59:41.130
"got down the stairway,
got outside,

01:59:41.174 --> 01:59:43.611
"got into my marvelous car,
fixed the seat belt,

01:59:43.654 --> 01:59:45.090
"backed out the drive.

01:59:45.134 --> 01:59:46.918
"Feeling warm
to the fingertips,

01:59:46.962 --> 01:59:49.747
"down to my foot
on the gas pedal,

01:59:49.791 --> 01:59:51.706
"I entered the world once more,

01:59:51.749 --> 01:59:53.795
"drove down the hill
past the houses

01:59:53.838 --> 01:59:55.623
"full and empty of people.

01:59:55.666 --> 01:59:58.103
"I saw the mailman, honked.

01:59:58.147 --> 02:00:00.541
He waved back at me."
