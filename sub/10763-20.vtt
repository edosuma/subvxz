WEBVTT

00:09.109 --> 00:10.377
Just the man I want to see.
Coffee, please.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.078
Niles, Niles, please...?

00:12.078 --> 00:13.380
You will not believe
the morning I've had...

00:13.380 --> 00:15.382
Would you be terribly offended
if I asked you

00:15.382 --> 00:17.384
just not to talk about it
and sit quietly?

00:17.384 --> 00:19.085
Can I at least tell you...?

00:19.085 --> 00:21.076
Shh-shh. Please, I do not have
time for your folderol today.

00:21.388 --> 00:22.377
I am meeting Charlotte
for lunch,

00:23.089 --> 00:25.392
and I am planning my strategy
on how to win her over.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.093
I thought you said she has
a boyfriend,

00:27.093 --> 00:28.395
this environmentalist fellow.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.096
Yes. Frank.
Well, so... Thank you.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.398
What's your plan
to get around him?

00:31.398 --> 00:35.095
I'm merely going to present
myself as the anti-Frank.

00:36.803 --> 00:40.796
Ah, so you're going to be
not rugged and not handsome.

00:41.307 --> 00:42.296
No.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.811
You also could be not passionate
and not committed.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.312
Very funny.
Maybe she'd
like you

00:46.312 --> 00:48.314
if you were not interesting
and not informed.

00:48.314 --> 00:49.315
Niles!

00:49.315 --> 00:50.817
Well, you said my
day was folderol!

00:50.817 --> 00:51.806
Sometimes it is!

00:53.319 --> 00:55.321
I don't believe you.
Well, it's true.

00:55.321 --> 00:56.811
My roommate and I used to listen

00:57.323 --> 00:58.825
to your show every day,
just for you.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.326
We fell in love with your voice.

01:00.326 --> 01:02.262
Really?

01:02.262 --> 01:04.763
(soothingly):
It's just a voice.

01:04.763 --> 01:07.255
Well, all the guys on my floor
listen to you.

01:07.767 --> 01:08.256
To our show?

01:08.768 --> 01:10.770
Yeah.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.761
Boy, things sure have
changed since I was in college.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.275
Mmm. Well, it wasn't exactly
college. More like prison.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.776
Oh, so was mine.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.778
So, where'd you go?

01:18.778 --> 01:20.280
Prison.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.581
Oh.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.217
So...

01:24.217 --> 01:27.414
(soothingly): you fell in love
with my voice?

01:27.620 --> 01:28.177
Hi!
Oh!

01:28.721 --> 01:29.210
Charlotte, hi, hi.
Hi.

01:29.689 --> 01:30.690
You remember
my brother, Niles?

01:30.690 --> 01:31.679
Yes, Charlotte.
Oh, hello!

01:32.192 --> 01:32.681
How are you?
Hi.

01:33.126 --> 01:34.694
Well, frustrated.
I've been selling

01:34.694 --> 01:36.696
this guy all over town,
but no one's buying.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.687
Oh, well, perhaps if
you'd throw in a toaster.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.188
Oh!

01:40.700 --> 01:42.702
I just have to call Frank
before we head out.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.204
Oh, right.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.206
So, everything's settled
between the two of you?

01:46.206 --> 01:47.696
Oh, yeah, he came over
last night.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.210
I don't even remember
what we were fighting about.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.711
(laughs)

01:51.711 --> 01:54.214
You know what that means,
don't you?!

01:54.214 --> 01:57.717
They had a long night
of acrobatic makeup sex.

01:57.717 --> 02:00.208
I just thought of another way
you could be the anti-Frank.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.212
Niles?
Hmm?

02:04.724 --> 02:05.725
Keep an eye out for her,
will you?

02:05.725 --> 02:06.726
What are you doing?

02:06.726 --> 02:08.228
Research.

02:08.228 --> 02:09.729
Frasier! Frasier! Foul play!

02:09.729 --> 02:11.720
All is fair in love and war.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.235
That's interesting.

02:15.235 --> 02:18.238
An anthology of Irish plays.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.239
It's perfect!

02:19.239 --> 02:20.707
What do you know
about Irish plays?

02:20.707 --> 02:22.242
Nothing, but not for long.

02:22.242 --> 02:25.211
There's one area where no man
has ever bested me, Niles.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.202
Homework!

02:27.714 --> 02:28.715
Oh, uh,
Charlotte, listen.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.205
I was just beeped
by a patient

02:30.717 --> 02:32.218
who's-who's desperate
to see me.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.720
So, do you mind
if we just switch

02:33.720 --> 02:35.255
Iunch for dinner?

02:35.255 --> 02:36.847
.
Actually, that's better for me

02:37.357 --> 02:38.858
I have four new clients
coming in.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.860
Just think,
the woman of your dreams

02:40.860 --> 02:42.862
may be sitting in my office
this afternoon.

02:42.862 --> 02:43.851
Indeed she may.

02:44.364 --> 02:45.296
(chuckling)

02:50.770 --> 02:52.772
Oh, Monsieur, it is so nice
to see you again.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.774
Your special table
is ready for you.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.332
And the wine?
As you requested,
Monsieur.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.311
Right. And the roses?
I'm so sorry, Monsieur.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.313
I felt that the scent
would distract

03:00.313 --> 03:02.873
from the wine's
distinctive bouquet.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.409
You forgot them, didn't you?
Yes, forgive me.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.408
For God's sake, Georges!

03:06.753 --> 03:08.311
Send a busboy out to pick
some wildflowers, please.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.290
Very good, Monsieur.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.293
Gee, you kind of sprinted
ahead of me there.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.284
I'm so sorry.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.797
Listen, I just wanted to make sure
that we could get a good table.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.299
Here, come and sit.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.301
This place is kind of fancy
for a working dinner.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.303
Yes, well, after the rigors of
your camping trip with Frank,

03:23.303 --> 03:26.806
I thought that you deserved
a little elegance.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.535
Thank you.

03:28.775 --> 03:29.842
So, good news.

03:29.842 --> 03:32.345
I met this great
woman today.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.846
How do you feel

03:33.846 --> 03:36.713
about dating someone a
little taller than you?

03:36.916 --> 03:38.618
How much taller?

03:38.618 --> 03:40.386
I don't know exactly,

03:40.386 --> 03:42.377
but I did have to turn
off the ceiling fan.

03:42.622 --> 03:46.422
Well, let's just put her
in the "maybe" pile, shall we?

03:49.696 --> 03:51.698
Hi, sweetie.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.700
Sorry to interrupt.
I know you're working.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.691
Oh... Frank, you know Frasier.
Yes, yes, of course.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.704
Nice to see again, Frasier.
Good to see you, Frank.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.405
I just need the keys
to your apartment.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.707
I left
my blue field notebook there,

04:00.707 --> 04:02.408
and I want to double-check
some old whale songs

04:02.408 --> 04:03.397
I copied down.
Oh, sure.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.411
Been in a boat all day
recording whale songs,

04:05.411 --> 04:06.412
and I think
we might have had

04:06.412 --> 04:07.572
a really big
interpretive breakthrough.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.250
Oh! You must tell us
about it sometime.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.018
That's a great wine.
Can I steal a glass?

04:12.018 --> 04:14.520
Yeah, here.
You don't mind, do you?

04:14.520 --> 04:17.011
N-No, no.
Not at all.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.959
Although, as the lrish say,

04:19.959 --> 04:21.461
"A man takes a drink,

04:21.461 --> 04:23.463
"the drink takes a drink,

04:23.463 --> 04:25.954
the drink takes the man. "

04:26.266 --> 04:27.358
That's very good.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.734
"As the old cock crows,
the young cock learns. "

04:33.640 --> 04:38.043
Yes, well, wasn't it
O'Casey who once wrote:

04:38.411 --> 04:40.980
"The Irish treat
a serious thing as a joke

04:40.980 --> 04:43.380
and a joke as a serious thing"?

04:43.549 --> 04:46.619
Well, you'd really have to ask Frank about that.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.383
He's the one who loves
Irish literature.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.427
He lent me an anthology, but I
haven't made much of a dent in it.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.416
I'm sorry, honey, I'm trying.

04:55.928 --> 04:56.929
I know you
are, baby.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.920
The flowers
as you requested, Monsieur.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.926
I'm sorry. I thought
you were to bedeux.

05:02.368 --> 05:03.469
Yes, well,
now we are trois.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.470
Thank you, Georges.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.472
Uh, could you bring us
another glass, please?

05:06.472 --> 05:07.632
Yes, I understand,
Monsieur.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.773
It is most sophisticated of you.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.315
Frasier, you ordered
these flowers?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.817
Well, the table
just looked so bare.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.818
These are great choices, man.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.320
These are all
Washington wildflowers.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.821
Remember, from our hike?

05:21.821 --> 05:25.825
Foxglove, fine-tooth penstemon,
harsh paintbrush...

05:25.825 --> 05:27.327
Ah!

05:27.327 --> 05:29.329
Remember this one?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.830
Oh, it's on the tip
of my tongue...

05:30.830 --> 05:33.366
Monkey flower.
Monkey flower.

05:33.366 --> 05:37.770
Yes, often confused
with the chimp pansy.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.472
(laughing)

05:39.472 --> 05:40.773
Frank made the same
joke this morning.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.001
Oh!

05:42.408 --> 05:42.809
Yeah. Great minds.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.510
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.514
(speaking French)

05:48.514 --> 05:52.819
(speaking French)

05:52.819 --> 05:53.720
Oh.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.711
Terrific.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.028
Hey, how you doing?

06:02.028 --> 06:04.530
Hi. Hey, look at you,
Mr. Handsome.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.020
Oh, thanks.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.035
We're going to go hear
Ronee sing at the Rendezvous.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.037
And then afterwards,
I am going to give her

06:11.037 --> 06:13.039
her engagement ring.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.030
Oh! Let's have a look.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.809
(chuckles)

06:16.809 --> 06:19.073
Oh, Martin, it's beautiful.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.471
She's going to
love this.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.845
Oh, thanks. You know,
I forgot I had it.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.584
I bought it years ago
for Sherry,

06:24.584 --> 06:25.983
but then we broke up.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.722
You can't give Ronee a used ring.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.087
Sherry never even touched it.

06:31.457 --> 06:32.525
It doesn't matter.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.516
Ronee deserves something
that you picked out
just for her.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.929
Well, she'll think I picked this out just for her.

06:37.463 --> 06:38.598
id.
But you didn't.
But she'll think I d

06:38.598 --> 06:39.963
But you didn't.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.468
You'll have to sell that one
and buy Ronee a new one.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.902
Niles, come on.
Back me up here.

06:45.438 --> 06:46.803
You can't be serious.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.510
Oh, geez.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.811
Fine.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.513
Back in the vault.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.172
(chuckles)

06:54.514 --> 06:55.581
Some vault!

06:55.581 --> 06:57.583
It's an old cigar box

06:57.583 --> 07:01.087
with a bunch of silver dollars
and Eddie's baby teeth.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.952
Oh, hey, Roz.
What are you doing here?

07:03.222 --> 07:04.814
Oh, hi. I was just shopping 
around the corner.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.793
Thought I'd stop by.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.522
Oh, gosh. Well,
unfortunately, I have a date.

07:08.828 --> 07:09.590
That's okay.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.864
I have one myself, with Steve.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.559
Oh, yes,
your convict friend.

07:13.866 --> 07:14.867
Do you think
that's wise?

07:14.867 --> 07:16.569
The man made one mistake.

07:16.569 --> 07:17.866
Besides, I don't know any guy

07:18.571 --> 07:19.868
who's not a little fascinated
by fire.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.832
Yes, and a felon now knows
where you live.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.545
(cell phone rings)

07:25.545 --> 07:26.846
I'm not at otalidiot.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.211
Hello?

07:28.514 --> 07:30.049
Oh, yeah, hi,
Steve.

07:30.049 --> 07:33.041
I'm grabbing my coat.
I'll be right down.

07:33.553 --> 07:34.645
You--

07:35.922 --> 07:39.492
So, you have
a date tonight?

07:39.492 --> 07:40.993
Yes, yes, actually,

07:40.993 --> 07:43.496
Charlotte and I have been out
three times this week.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.861
We have been wine-tasting,
beach combing,

07:45.164 --> 07:46.199
and we actually
shared a blanket

07:46.199 --> 07:47.700
in a horse-drawn
carriage.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.702
I take it Frank's off
in the mountains again.

07:49.702 --> 07:52.839
Oh, no.
He was there, too.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.173
Let's go.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.175
You mean, it's been
the three of you all week?

07:56.175 --> 07:57.665
Well, it's not exactly
how I want it,

07:58.177 --> 08:00.179
but the more time
I spend with them,

08:00.179 --> 08:02.010
the less time they get
to spend alone together.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.005
It doesn't bother Frank, you
tagging along on their dates?

08:04.517 --> 08:07.019
Frank? No. In fact,
he's quite taken with me.

08:07.019 --> 08:10.022
Doesn't even occur to him
that I might be a rival.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.024
Galling, yes,
but it does give me more time

08:12.024 --> 08:14.026
to work my magic
on Charlotte.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.517
In another week, you can
kiss Frank good-bye.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.169
Maybe we'll wait
till there's not a line.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.158
Hi, guys.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.172
Hello.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.173
Gangsta!

08:27.173 --> 08:28.162
What it is!

08:28.674 --> 08:29.663
(chuckles)

08:31.677 --> 08:34.544
So, what's going on?
I thought we were
meeting downtown.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.916
I know. I'm sorry.
But can we stay in tonight?

08:36.916 --> 08:39.619
I've got to get up early
and catch a flight to Chicago

08:39.619 --> 08:40.677
for some divorce stuff,

08:40.919 --> 08:41.953
and Frank's beat.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.649
Yeah, I was at
the beach all day

08:43.956 --> 08:44.945
cataloguing the
stomach contents

08:45.658 --> 08:46.659
of a dead elephant seal.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.962
It was like all-you-can-eat
down at The Lobster Pot.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.554
(laughing):
I'm sorry.

08:51.764 --> 08:55.301
The collapse of our coastal
fisheries is no joke.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.700
I'm just punchy.

08:56.936 --> 08:57.970
We brought some movies.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.961
We couldn't agree
on which one to watch,

09:00.673 --> 09:02.675
so you break the tie.

09:02.675 --> 09:03.976
Well...

09:03.976 --> 09:06.570
Hmm.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.339
"The Perfect Storm..."

09:09.815 --> 09:12.785
or "When Harry Met Sally. "

09:12.785 --> 09:15.288
I guess I'm going
to have to go for When Harry Met Sally.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.654
Yes! He'll have
what I'm having!

09:19.000 --> 09:25.074

09:27.133 --> 09:28.191
Oh, hi!
Hey.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.703
We keep passing each other.
Yeah.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.170
We have some dessert here,
if you want to stay.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.071
Oh, no thanks. I've got to cat
an early flight,

09:34.774 --> 09:35.675
but tell Frasier I'll call him.

09:35.675 --> 09:36.609
Sure.
Bye.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.978
Bye-bye.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.980
Do I know her?

09:40.980 --> 09:42.982
Yeah, she's the woman
Frasier's been after.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.685
She has a boyfriend already, 
but maybe something happened.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.983
I'll say! You don't get
that hairstyle sitting up.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.251
Aw, geez.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.230
Well...

09:58.230 --> 10:00.698
so long as he's happy.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.074
(doorbell rings)

10:08.074 --> 10:10.042
MARTIN: Oh, hi, guys.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.744
Hey, Dad.
FRASIER: Hey, Daphne, Niles.

10:11.744 --> 10:14.046
Listen, the opera tickets
are right there by the phone.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.604
Wish I could use them myself.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.249
Well, if you'd
gotten a third,

10:17.249 --> 10:19.240
you could take that
couple you've been dating.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.891
Yes, that's very droll.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.393
Frank injured himself
on our hike,

10:27.393 --> 10:30.260
so I've got Charlotte
all to myself this evening.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.365
I'm not going to waste
this opportunity.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.866
I'm going to make her
a romantic dinner

10:33.866 --> 10:34.867
and then tell her
how I feel about her.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.369
Wow, really?

10:36.369 --> 10:37.870
Are, are you sure
she's ready for that?

10:37.870 --> 10:39.372
Well, I don't know,
but I can't stand

10:39.372 --> 10:40.873
this ridiculous threesome
anymore.

10:40.873 --> 10:44.377
You know, the worst part
is how completely unthreatening

10:44.377 --> 10:47.369
Frank finds me, as if I'm
some sort of a harem eunuch.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.838
How'd he hurt himself, anyway?

10:49.882 --> 10:53.943
Well, he strained his back
carrying me over a brook.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.947
You wounded him, and you're 
stealing his woman in the same day?

10:57.423 --> 10:58.891
Well, I didn't ask the m
an to carry me.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.381
He simply hoisted me
over his shoulder

11:00.893 --> 11:01.894
before I could stop him.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.896
That's not something
you get used to,

11:03.896 --> 11:05.261
no matter how many times
it happens.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.767
Don't you worry about it.
You just do what you gotta do.

11:07.767 --> 11:08.756
Thanks, Dad.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.670
Wish me luck.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.972
I'm making her beef bourguigno
from a new recipe.

11:12.972 --> 11:13.734
MARTIN: Good luck.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.837
Flour the beef.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.882
Mm, you're looking
very sharp.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.383
Oh, I got
the new ring.

11:24.383 --> 11:25.885
Oh, let's have a look.

11:25.885 --> 11:26.874
I sold the old one

11:27.386 --> 11:28.888
and got this new one
this morning.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.390
Oh.
Dad, it's huge.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.392
Oh, it's
beautiful, Martin.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.894
Yeah.

11:34.894 --> 11:35.895
Hi.
Hey.

11:35.895 --> 11:36.884
What's going on?

11:37.396 --> 11:38.397
Nothing.

11:38.397 --> 11:41.264
Oh, you look
lovely tonight.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.836
But, you know,
I think

11:43.836 --> 11:46.839
your hand is kind
of underdressed.

11:46.839 --> 11:49.141
Oh, my God!

11:49.141 --> 11:51.701
Marty, it's gorgeous.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.479
Oh, I love it,
and I love you.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.481
In that order.

11:55.481 --> 11:56.846
Thank you.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.118
Listen, I've got
to go wash my hands.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.353
I was eating Cheetos
all the way over.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.787
I love this lady.

12:06.325 --> 12:08.327
.
Oh, it's brilliant

12:08.327 --> 12:11.785
Oh, you had it
inscribed.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.365
I did?

12:14.734 --> 12:18.838
"Lil Q-Pid.
Til def do us part. "

12:18.838 --> 12:19.497
What is that?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.440
What?
Let me see that.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.807
Isn't Lil Q-Pid
that obese rapper?

12:26.812 --> 12:28.848
The one they 
arrested for drugs.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.338
Where did you
get this ring?

12:30.850 --> 12:32.852
At an auction.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.218
A police auction.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.324
You can't give
that to her.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.849
Well, I can't take it back.
She loves it.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.018
What are you
gonna tell her?

12:42.461 --> 12:43.963
Well, just relax,
I'll handle it.

12:43.963 --> 12:47.466
Well, there's my lil cupid.

12:47.466 --> 12:51.470
All beautiful
and clean.

12:51.470 --> 12:56.976
All you need is a bow
and arrow, lil cupid.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.211
Why are you calling me that?

12:59.211 --> 13:00.269
Well, I always call you that.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.248
No, no, you don't.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.517
Oh, well, maybe I mostly say it
when you're not around

13:04.517 --> 13:05.851
Oh, yes.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.854
It's always "lil cupid said this"

13:08.854 --> 13:10.356
or "lil cupid did that".

13:10.356 --> 13:12.858
It looks
beautiful on you.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.348
Thank you.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.263
Now promise me
you'll never take it off, lil cupid.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.252
Okay, okay, I promise,

13:18.964 --> 13:20.266
if you'll
stop calling me that.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.267
Deal.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.962
I'm going to go look
at this in the mirror.

13:28.073 --> 13:29.870
How did you get it
to fit her?

13:30.109 --> 13:32.111
Lil Q-Pid's as big
as a house.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.013
Keep your
voice down.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.072
It was a toe ring.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.480
Here we are, beef bourguignon

13:45.991 --> 13:47.993
with sauted fiddlehead ferns,

13:47.993 --> 13:49.483
and walnut chutney.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.163
It's my own recipe.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.567
It's exactly what I need
after the day I've had.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.159
Well, maybe I could
give you a neck rub

13:56.602 --> 13:57.603
while it cools.

13:57.603 --> 14:00.105
Oh, you're the best.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.608
I'm so sorry you've had
to put up with

14:02.608 --> 14:04.109
all this business
with me and Frank.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.111
What business?

14:06.111 --> 14:07.613
Well, you know.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.114
Just all this tension
between us.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.617
There's tension?

14:11.617 --> 14:14.119
He's a great guy.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.622
We just seem to be...

14:16.622 --> 14:18.123
I don't know...

14:18.123 --> 14:20.114
Fighting?
Growing apart?

14:20.626 --> 14:21.627
Not clicking?

14:21.627 --> 14:23.492
(knocking)

14:23.929 --> 14:24.520
FRANK:
Charlotte?

14:24.930 --> 14:26.332
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.333
It's my watch. It's caught.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.198
Here...

14:33.405 --> 14:33.962
Should have known.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.407
The minute I'm laid up,

14:35.407 --> 14:37.307
you're over here
making my lady dinner.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.136
You're true blue, buddy.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.148
Hi, baby.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.137
Hello, Frank.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.655
Walnut chutney.
That's daring.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.924
Were you giving her a backrub?

14:51.924 --> 14:53.050
Was I?

14:53.359 --> 14:55.060
Well, yes, yes,
I suppose I was.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.221
Would you mind doing me?

14:57.463 --> 14:58.998
I took an aspirin
after our hike,

14:58.998 --> 15:00.989
but my neck's stilI a little tight.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.501
So tell me all
about Chicago.

15:02.501 --> 15:03.991
How was it?

15:04.436 --> 15:06.005
I'll tell you later.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.495
Oh, that's nice.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.175
Frasier,
stop rubbing his neck.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.164
Sit down.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.135
Why can't he rub my neck?

15:13.512 --> 15:14.546
Because when
you came in,

15:14.546 --> 15:16.048
we were just sitting
down to dinner.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.538
You could
have called first.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.449
Well, I didn't know I needed
to get clearance. Geez.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.443
You're as touchy
as a Hermit Thrush.

15:23.055 --> 15:23.419
This is typical of you.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.424
You come in here,

15:25.424 --> 15:26.425
you expect me
to change my plans

15:26.425 --> 15:27.927
because you're
suddenly available.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.689
It's insensitive.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.029
Oh, I'm insensitive?

15:30.029 --> 15:31.530
I've been tracking
a pod of humpback whales

15:31.530 --> 15:33.532
for a week, and they've been
talking their asses off,

15:33.532 --> 15:35.534
but have you once asked me
what Bonnie has to say?

15:35.534 --> 15:37.169
Or Robert or Grace?

15:37.169 --> 15:38.103
They're whales!

15:38.103 --> 15:38.967
They're my friends!

15:41.040 --> 15:42.074
Stop yelling.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.008
Look, you're
upsetting Frasier.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.611
I didn't do anything.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.101
I came in, kissed you hello,
and you jumped down my throat.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.480
What is your problem?

15:48.480 --> 15:50.082
You are
driving me crazy.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.083
Do you
believe her?

15:51.083 --> 15:53.085
Don't you drag him
into this.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.074
You know what? I can't
deal with this tonight.

15:54.386 --> 15:55.387
When can you
deal with it?

15:55.387 --> 15:56.388
I'll call ahead an
d make an appointment.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.377
I think you
should leave.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.091
Fine.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.080
Come on, Frasier.
Let's go.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.688
Times like this, a guy
really needs his buddy.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.142
(soft knocking)

16:17.142 --> 16:18.131
Mm...

16:20.145 --> 16:20.975
Hi.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.750
Just wanted to see
how you're doing.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.240
Tip-top.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.123
How's your friend?

16:31.123 --> 16:34.024
He went someplace dark.

16:34.193 --> 16:37.196
I couldn't follow.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.698
Him and his moods.

16:39.698 --> 16:43.435
No, no, he climbed
some kind of pine tree.

16:43.435 --> 16:46.739
Look, I'm sorry
about all that.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.742
I think this is it
for Frank and me.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.040
Really?

16:52.211 --> 16:53.212
It's just not working.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.214
I think I was always attracted

16:55.214 --> 17:01.210
to the idea of him
more than... him.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.724
This may seem
inappropriate,

17:06.724 --> 17:09.592
but I'm not entirely s
ad to hear you say that.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.566
What do you mean?

17:14.566 --> 17:17.057
I would think my feelings
were obvious by now,

17:17.569 --> 17:19.805
all the time we've been
spending together.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.306
I just thought it was because

17:21.306 --> 17:23.308
you were hitting it off
with Frank.

17:23.308 --> 17:24.297
Are you kidding?

17:24.810 --> 17:27.311
The man smells
like a chum boat.

17:27.311 --> 17:31.646
You, you're the on
e I wanted to be with.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.551
Look, um...

17:37.256 --> 17:38.553
I realize you're in
a vulnerable state,

17:39.258 --> 17:41.260
and you probably need
some time to process this,

17:41.260 --> 17:42.261
so I'll just, uh...

17:42.261 --> 17:43.558
Don't go.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.568
I've been thinking a little about you, too.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.171
Really?

17:52.171 --> 17:54.139
(chuckles nervously)

17:59.278 --> 18:01.678
Well, then...

18:15.194 --> 18:16.695
Oh, God,
I'm uncomfortable.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.197
I'm sorry.
I'm rushing things.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.198
No, no, I'm just...

18:19.198 --> 18:20.688
I'm laying
on a wine bottle.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.703
Good morning.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.551
Oh, dear God.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.246
Please tell me nothing
happened last night.

18:42.387 --> 18:45.288
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.294
(chuckling)

18:49.294 --> 18:51.296
I'm glad you stayed.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.524
Me, too.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.855
Hey, guys.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.705
You're in my robe.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.513
I guess you got caught
in the rain, too, huh?

19:07.513 --> 19:10.215
Yes, I did.

19:10.215 --> 19:13.207
What happened to your hand?

19:13.485 --> 19:14.486
(groans)

19:14.486 --> 19:17.189
I was so mad
last night, I...

19:17.189 --> 19:19.491
I punched a raccoon.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.482
God, I'm a bastard.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.896
You're a good guy
to come check on her.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.364
I never understand
why women don't like you.

19:29.368 --> 19:30.903
Can we talk?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.871
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.863
Uh, my clothes
should be dry by now.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.348
So what's going on with us?

19:43.348 --> 19:45.851
Oh, come on, Frank.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.388
I think you know
it's not working.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.413
Yeah.

19:51.423 --> 19:55.359
And, anyway, there is
something else you should know.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.230
When I was in Chicago,

19:58.230 --> 20:01.733
my ex told me
he's moving to New York.

20:01.733 --> 20:05.726
So I bought
the old business from him.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.229
I'm moving back home.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.642
(sighs)

20:10.642 --> 20:12.633
You sure about this?

20:13.345 --> 20:14.313
Yeah.

20:14.313 --> 20:15.814
I mean,
I know Chicago.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.304
I have friends there.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.818
Seattle just hasn't
panned out for me.

20:19.818 --> 20:21.820
I thought you should be
the first to know.

20:21.820 --> 20:26.382
Well, I know
you'll do great.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.261
So will you.

20:29.261 --> 20:32.253
Ah...

20:32.531 --> 20:33.623
Uh, I should
be going.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.334
That's okay.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.323
You stay.
I'm going.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.333
You know this isn't
your fault, right, partner?

20:45.777 --> 20:46.766
You be good, buddy.

20:53.785 --> 20:57.289
I know I should feel
sad for Frank,

20:57.289 --> 20:58.688
but I can't help
feeling happy.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.386
Frasier, I...

21:02.294 --> 21:04.630
Listen, I'm late
for about three things,

21:04.630 --> 21:06.632
so can I see you
later this afternoon?

21:06.632 --> 21:08.300
Maybe after my show?

21:08.300 --> 21:10.302
Okay.
After your show.

21:10.302 --> 21:11.303
Perfect.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.295
Uh, look, I hate
to jinx this, but...
