01:25.943 --> 01:29.071
Sylvia, I know now's
not a good time, but...

01:29.108 --> 01:30.010
Yeah?

01:31.122 --> 01:32.165
We should talk.

01:35.119 --> 01:37.031
We will, but not now.

01:38.143 --> 01:38.874
Okay.

01:54.827 --> 01:55.904
The signal is still active,

01:55.939 --> 01:57.365
so... we're good to go.

01:58.963 --> 02:01.117
<i>Madsen, Tanner, listen up.</i>

02:01.153 --> 02:03.621
According to our intel,
the house is empty.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.436
the Titov family
left this afternoon.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.070
The house next door
is on the market,

02:08.105 --> 02:10.156
and also without residents.

02:10.190 --> 02:12.102
<i>But still proceed with caution.</i>

02:12.137 --> 02:13.284
Almost there.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.145
Is this your first
holiday break-in?

02:22.181 --> 02:24.788
Nah. This is just
a regular weekend break-in.

02:24.823 --> 02:26.352
It's not Christmas yet.

02:35.736 --> 02:37.127
<i>Signal is green.</i>

02:37.162 --> 02:38.239
You're good to go.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.170
Cyber crime
pays pretty well, huh?

02:48.770 --> 02:50.682
-Nice house.
-Mm-hmm.

02:56.416 --> 02:57.355
Unlocking.

03:00.901 --> 03:02.603
<i>Okay, we're in.</i>

03:02.637 --> 03:04.933
Look at that.
Money can't buy you style.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.462
Shut up.

03:14.038 --> 03:16.228
Agents are proceeding
to the second floor.

03:26.968 --> 03:28.670
<i>You need to manually scan</i>

03:28.705 --> 03:29.992
<i>to pinpoint the correct device.</i>

03:34.545 --> 03:38.020
-Signal is green.
-That's the one.
Take it and leave.

03:59.154 --> 03:59.814
Please, don't...

04:02.246 --> 04:03.637
Stay on the floor.

04:05.199 --> 04:06.939
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:06.973 --> 04:10.413
Hey, hey, hey!
The house is not empty.

04:10.448 --> 04:12.709
<i>There's a child</i>
<i>in one of these bedrooms.</i>

04:14.098 --> 04:15.627
Movement, four Tangos,

04:15.662 --> 04:17.573
<i>on foot. Next door.</i>

04:18.443 --> 04:19.139
Send the car.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.093
Fifteen seconds.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.353
Alarm has activated.

04:24.387 --> 04:26.229
Get out of there now.

04:26.264 --> 04:27.307
Almost done.

04:41.799 --> 04:43.398
Oh, my God, I, I shot a child.

04:45.171 --> 04:46.214
<i>I shot a child.</i>

04:47.431 --> 04:50.106
Additional movement
inside the house.

04:50.142 --> 04:52.748
-<i>Come on!
</i> -We need to get them out of there now.

04:52.783 --> 04:54.904
-Come on, breathe.
-We have to go.

04:54.938 --> 04:56.641
Leave him!

04:56.677 --> 04:58.413
-Stay out!
-Sylvia, we have to go!
Come on!

05:00.117 --> 05:01.994
<i>Evacuate via the north balcony.</i>

05:12.699 --> 05:15.061
<i>Tanner, Madsen, report!</i>

05:15.096 --> 05:17.182
Is the computer
traveling with you?

05:17.216 --> 05:18.155
<i>Affirmative.</i>

05:19.616 --> 05:21.874
How the fuck
did that just happen?

05:22.779 --> 05:23.926
It was not your fault.

05:41.860 --> 05:44.467
I don't care who's
fucking fault it was.

05:45.788 --> 05:46.691
I shot a kid.

05:47.873 --> 05:49.611
A fucking kid. I shot a kid.

05:50.548 --> 05:51.766
It was not your fault.

06:27.774 --> 06:29.720
The boy agent Madsen shot dead

06:29.755 --> 06:31.876
was Leonid Titov's son, Yuri.

06:31.910 --> 06:34.830
Sylvia Madsen is not to blame.
It was my responsibility.

06:34.864 --> 06:36.671
I'm not laying blame.
I just need to make sure

06:36.707 --> 06:39.209
the Swedes get
opportunities to analyze her.

06:39.244 --> 06:41.571
Political correctness
is imperative on this matter.

06:41.607 --> 06:42.997
Everything must go by the book.

06:56.483 --> 07:00.376
We have Titov's computer.
His son used to play online.

07:00.411 --> 07:01.696
Once our people crack it,

07:01.732 --> 07:04.026
we expect definite
proof against Titov.

07:05.068 --> 07:08.127
Money laundering, disinformation
campaigns, etcetera.

07:11.186 --> 07:13.444
But we can't use
any of that now.

07:14.661 --> 07:17.233
The incident has been
reported as a burglary-homicide.

07:17.268 --> 07:19.318
We're denying
all EU involvement.

07:19.354 --> 07:20.396
And unofficially?

07:21.926 --> 07:23.907
Well, Titov still has
a lot of pull in Russia.

07:23.941 --> 07:25.054
He's protected.

07:27.834 --> 07:30.892
-Okay.
-I have some
housekeeping to do here.

07:30.928 --> 07:33.708
And you will go back to Finland.

07:33.742 --> 07:34.680
For now.

07:39.199 --> 07:40.242
Anything else?

07:42.640 --> 07:43.440
No.

08:07.874 --> 08:10.237
<i>You're saying she made</i>
<i>a mistake during the operation.</i>

08:10.967 --> 08:13.470
-<i>No.
-</i> -<i>And after</i> <i>this incidence,</i>

08:13.505 --> 08:15.764
<i>would you work</i>
<i>with Sylvia Madsen again?</i>

08:20.317 --> 08:21.360
Yes, I would.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.331
Hmm.

12:27.301 --> 12:28.343
Hey, Sylvia...

12:29.490 --> 12:31.055
...just wanted to call you.

12:35.469 --> 12:38.562
Call me back...
when you get this.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.969
Vasa?

13:39.005 --> 13:40.361
My name is Anya.

13:40.395 --> 13:41.160
How did you find me?

13:42.793 --> 13:44.566
-What do you want?
-I'm a lawyer,

13:44.602 --> 13:46.512
and I have
a proposition for you.

13:58.886 --> 14:02.535
-So...
-I know you're
in financial trouble.

14:03.370 --> 14:04.759
How did you know that?

14:06.358 --> 14:07.506
I can help you.

14:09.627 --> 14:10.669
How?

14:12.163 --> 14:15.534
Your father is
Colonel Borislav Jankovic.

14:15.569 --> 14:16.785
-Yes?
-Yeah.

14:17.723 --> 14:20.609
I know he was
wrongfully accused.

14:20.643 --> 14:22.833
Sentenced to prison.

14:22.868 --> 14:25.579
And the EU is writing
your country's history

14:25.613 --> 14:27.283
to their favor at the same time.

14:28.186 --> 14:29.403
It's very sad.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.303
My employer offers you
the opportunity to...

14:34.338 --> 14:36.076
...make it up to your father.

14:40.385 --> 14:42.818
And also become
extremely wealthy.

14:45.113 --> 14:48.553
I am not a mercenary
and I'm not a criminal.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.335
There are lots of good men like
that still loyal to your father

14:51.369 --> 14:53.245
and also to your late brother.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.436
They will help.

15:05.514 --> 15:06.557
Think about it.

15:10.763 --> 15:11.806
How wealthy?

15:13.578 --> 15:14.794
Astronomically.

15:29.949 --> 15:33.008
<i>General Morel has recently</i>
<i>approached EU leaders,</i>

15:33.043 --> 15:34.989
<i>with a proposal</i>
<i>that the EU should tighten</i>

15:35.024 --> 15:37.908
<i>its economic sanctions</i>
<i>against Russia, if Russia</i>

15:37.943 --> 15:41.036
<i>does not stop</i>
<i>protecting cyberattacks,</i>
<i>and this information--</i>

15:41.071 --> 15:43.296
General Morel is
a somewhat controversial figure

15:43.331 --> 15:45.520
<i>right now.</i>
<i>So he needs protection</i>

15:45.556 --> 15:47.292
<i>for his trip to Finland.</i>

15:47.328 --> 15:49.622
<i>He is in very good terms</i>
<i>with your president.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:51.777
They're old friends.

15:51.812 --> 15:54.487
But given your country's
special relationship

15:54.521 --> 15:57.789
<i>with Russia,</i>
<i>I predict some political</i>
<i>turmoil on the horizon.</i>

16:02.620 --> 16:04.532
Should we arrange
a security detail for him?

16:06.965 --> 16:08.182
Not necessary.

16:09.119 --> 16:10.927
We'll do it--

16:10.962 --> 16:13.012
discreetly, under the radar.

16:13.047 --> 16:16.176
<i>I already have</i>
<i>someone perfect for the job.</i>

16:19.582 --> 16:21.807
Hey, it's Sylvia.

16:21.842 --> 16:22.570
<i>Hey there.</i>

16:24.101 --> 16:26.047
<i>I'm sorry, I haven't called.</i>

16:26.082 --> 16:28.307
Yeah, don't worry about it.

16:28.341 --> 16:29.557
It was pretty...

16:30.531 --> 16:32.893
...tough after
everything that happened.

16:34.040 --> 16:34.979
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

16:36.509 --> 16:38.037
How are you feeling now?

16:38.072 --> 16:40.540
<i>Well, I'm, I'm back at work.</i>

16:40.576 --> 16:42.278
And I'm coming to Helsinki.

16:43.668 --> 16:44.886
<i>-Oh!</i>
-Yeah, I'll be there

16:44.920 --> 16:46.518
for a couple of days. Will,

16:46.553 --> 16:47.944
will you have time to say hello?

16:50.655 --> 16:52.010
I'd like that.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.053
<i>Maybe we can...</i>

16:54.026 --> 16:55.068
<i>...do something fun.</i>

16:56.182 --> 16:57.084
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:00.039 --> 17:00.942
Yeah.

18:50.845 --> 18:52.478
And it was a good shot too.

18:56.371 --> 18:58.109
I'm just going to wear my suit.

18:58.144 --> 18:59.464
A black suit.

18:59.499 --> 19:01.237
So you wanna
look like his bodyguard?

19:01.272 --> 19:02.939
I am his bodyguard!

19:02.973 --> 19:04.435
-That's all you are?
-Yeah.

19:04.469 --> 19:06.102
-Just a bodyguard?
-Mm-mm.

19:06.137 --> 19:07.493
Nothing else?

19:07.529 --> 19:08.571
No.

19:10.308 --> 19:11.559
Is Morel dirty?

19:11.593 --> 19:12.985
I haven't said anything.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.583
I'm just his bodyguard.

19:15.730 --> 19:18.510
-I take that as a yes.
-Mm-hmm.

19:18.545 --> 19:19.588
Shh!

19:23.342 --> 19:24.385
Okay.

19:33.561 --> 19:34.882
-Ugh!
-Okay.

19:34.916 --> 19:37.383
-Um--
-So it's my turn.

19:37.418 --> 19:38.461
Oh damn.

19:41.693 --> 19:44.023
Why haven't you
started a family?

19:44.058 --> 19:45.898
Settle down,
raise a couple of kids--

19:45.934 --> 19:47.256
Maybe I haven't
found the right person

19:47.290 --> 19:48.853
to start a family with.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.109
Is there a right person?

19:55.144 --> 19:57.090
Yeah, there is. But...

19:58.168 --> 19:59.349
...it's impossible.

20:03.835 --> 20:04.878
Okay.

20:09.048 --> 20:10.923
How's Stefan?

20:10.959 --> 20:12.177
He's fine.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.087
Home with the kids alone, again.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.880
So, this is me.

20:49.365 --> 20:50.408
Are you coming?

21:26.382 --> 21:28.433
You still haven't said
what you wanted to say.

21:30.031 --> 21:31.073
I know.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.683
It's good that I'm here
for another night then.

Good evening, sir.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.921
Would
you like a drink?

24:10.957 --> 24:12.833
I just opened
a bottle of champagne.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.258
Well, I guess
one glass won't hurt.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.253
Thank you.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.447
Though some would argue
that its shared border

-It must be defended.
-Yes.

27:33.626 --> 27:35.502
-Yeah.
-...for Europe and the UN.

27:36.648 --> 27:37.553
Yeah.

27:38.595 --> 27:41.202
The process has been,
has been challenging.

27:41.237 --> 27:44.365
Especially concerning
the HX fighter program.

31:03.141 --> 31:04.530
Nobody moves!

31:09.953 --> 31:11.273
Stay down!

31:21.769 --> 31:22.812
Get down!

31:23.855 --> 31:25.003
Get down!

31:25.038 --> 31:26.427
Gun on the floor.

31:27.539 --> 31:28.617
Put the gun down!

31:36.508 --> 31:38.523
Down! Down! On the floor!

31:47.664 --> 31:48.707
On the floor.

32:34.238 --> 32:35.629
<i>Step one completed.</i>

32:41.120 --> 32:42.129
Stay down!

32:51.547 --> 32:53.529
<i>I'm speaking</i>
<i>to you from the main hall.</i>

32:54.502 --> 32:55.995
<i>Stay down,</i>

32:56.031 --> 32:57.804
<i>stay on the floor and be calm.</i>

32:59.924 --> 33:02.287
<i>Phone service is down.</i>

33:02.321 --> 33:03.712
<i>Data is down.</i>

33:03.746 --> 33:05.380
<i>We have control.</i>

33:05.415 --> 33:06.840
Everybody stay on the ground.

33:06.874 --> 33:08.856
<i>Do not do something stupid.</i>

33:08.890 --> 33:09.864
Don't move.

33:11.776 --> 33:12.437
Get over here!

33:13.826 --> 33:14.834
Nobody move!

33:16.678 --> 33:20.465
<i>All doors are</i>
<i>equipped with explosives.</i>

33:21.438 --> 33:24.984
<i>So don't try to run.</i>
<i>That goes for every room.</i>

33:25.019 --> 33:26.999
<i>Stay on the floor and be calm.</i>

33:28.493 --> 33:29.780
<i>We're gonna dim the lights.</i>

33:33.603 --> 33:34.541
<i>Stay down.</i>

33:35.758 --> 33:37.739
<i>We have control.</i>

33:37.773 --> 33:39.024
<i>Nobody's gonna get hurt.</i>

34:03.426 --> 34:04.572
Mr. President.

34:06.935 --> 34:07.701
Get up.

34:23.028 --> 34:23.931
Move.

34:25.287 --> 34:26.330
Move!

34:29.284 --> 34:31.195
Omerta, report.

34:33.107 --> 34:34.149
Doors secured.

34:36.896 --> 34:38.285
Move, outside.

34:43.153 --> 34:44.195
Move.

34:45.098 --> 34:46.281
Out.

34:46.315 --> 34:47.531
Move!

34:50.278 --> 34:51.182
Left.

34:53.544 --> 34:54.830
Go up! Up!

37:38.709 --> 37:39.752
Put him through.

37:40.864 --> 37:43.018
<i>Um, it's Peter Nylund</i>
<i>from Helsinki.</i>

37:43.054 --> 37:44.791
<i>Our Presidential Palace...</i>

37:45.522 --> 37:48.128
<i>...is under armed attack.</i>

37:53.898 --> 37:56.748
<i>O, have you located the target?</i>

37:56.784 --> 37:58.834
No. No, not yet.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.059
Find him.

38:05.334 --> 38:06.722
<i>General Morel...</i>

38:07.801 --> 38:09.261
<i>...please show yourself.</i>

38:10.721 --> 38:12.285
<i>Save us some time.</i>

38:13.710 --> 38:16.385
<i>You definitely don't want</i>
<i>us to start shooting people.</i>

38:20.036 --> 38:22.398
<i>I'm going to execute hostages.</i>

38:24.033 --> 38:25.076
I'm here.

38:31.193 --> 38:32.096
Move.

38:39.847 --> 38:40.751
Who's this?

38:45.131 --> 38:46.694
She's my date.

38:48.849 --> 38:49.788
She's your date?

38:51.594 --> 38:54.237
<i>Take her too.</i>
<i>She's part of the package.</i>

38:55.176 --> 38:56.287
We will need her later.

38:58.198 --> 38:59.207
Move.

39:38.169 --> 39:39.073
Sit down.

39:54.644 --> 39:55.583
Hands.

40:13.379 --> 40:15.394
This is Lieutenant
Marcus Tanner here.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.208
Who am I speaking with?

40:18.243 --> 40:19.286
Are you in charge?

40:20.504 --> 40:22.554
<i>I'm the negotiator.</i>

40:22.589 --> 40:23.701
<i>Who's this?</i>

40:23.736 --> 40:25.368
This is Vasa Jankovic.

40:29.402 --> 40:31.938
<i>We've heard some gunshots.</i>

40:31.973 --> 40:33.848
<i>Is everybody okay there?</i>

40:33.884 --> 40:36.665
Well, we didn't
come to harm anyone.

40:36.701 --> 40:37.915
<i>How's the president?</i>

40:38.716 --> 40:39.655
He's good.

40:40.593 --> 40:42.505
<i>And everybody else?</i>

40:42.539 --> 40:43.443
They're good.

40:44.346 --> 40:46.432
I would like you
to send us some proof

40:46.467 --> 40:48.065
that everybody's okay.

40:48.101 --> 40:49.630
<i>Can you do that for me?</i>

40:49.664 --> 40:51.574
First, I wanna give you
a little gift.

40:54.217 --> 40:56.268
<i>The call is disconnected.</i>

41:09.337 --> 41:10.866
Everybody up.

41:10.901 --> 41:11.943
Now!

41:13.682 --> 41:14.863
Come on, come on. Faster.

41:26.715 --> 41:27.931
Move!

41:33.007 --> 41:34.570
Let's go! Move!

42:01.472 --> 42:03.002
Move, move, move!

42:27.783 --> 42:29.590
Step two completed.

42:29.626 --> 42:32.059
<i>Good. Proceed as planned.</i>

42:39.670 --> 42:40.713
This is Tanner speaking.

42:41.894 --> 42:45.231
We will not be releasing
any more guests at this time.

42:46.239 --> 42:47.804
Is our president still with you?

42:49.785 --> 42:50.828
<i>Yeah, he's still here.</i>

42:52.253 --> 42:53.816
He's here among, um...

42:55.033 --> 42:57.743
...yeah, let's say, uh,
a group of special people.

42:58.473 --> 42:59.689
We will keep them.

43:02.297 --> 43:03.513
So what are your demands?

43:07.719 --> 43:09.179
My demands are...

43:09.909 --> 43:10.673
...number one...

43:11.959 --> 43:13.628
...the liberation
of my father...

43:14.705 --> 43:16.512
...Borislav Jankovic.

43:16.547 --> 43:17.694
<i>I want him transported</i>

43:17.729 --> 43:19.745
<i>here in a helicopter.</i>

43:19.780 --> 43:21.031
<i>Number two,</i>

43:21.066 --> 43:23.116
a private plane...

43:23.152 --> 43:26.244
...fueled and ready
to fly at Malmi airport.

43:28.260 --> 43:29.164
Number three...

43:30.067 --> 43:31.528
...I need a person capable

43:31.562 --> 43:33.926
of moving cryptocurrencies,

43:33.961 --> 43:37.229
available to me
in not more than 30 minutes.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.148
Then I will give you
more instructions later.

43:53.217 --> 43:54.434
<i>About 1300 guests--</i>

44:14.418 --> 44:16.295
We've looked
into that DDoS attack.

44:16.331 --> 44:18.693
There were thousands
of computers in that botnet.

44:18.729 --> 44:20.779
Professional stuff. This strike

44:20.814 --> 44:22.447
<i>seems to be backed</i>
<i>with big money.</i>

44:22.482 --> 44:24.811
<i>They must be</i>
<i>after something specific.</i>

44:24.845 --> 44:27.765
Sylvia Madsen is still
inside with general Morel.

44:27.801 --> 44:29.503
<i>She can handle herself.</i>

44:34.404 --> 44:36.385
She's not just
Morel's bodyguard, is she?

44:36.419 --> 44:40.208
<i>No, it's a cover to observe</i>
<i>and investigate Morel.</i>

44:40.243 --> 44:42.745
<i>-Why?</i>
-That's classified.

44:42.781 --> 44:45.421
<i>Now I want you to join</i>
<i>an intelligence briefing</i>

44:45.457 --> 44:47.438
<i>with me and the</i>
<i>Finnish authority.</i>

44:47.472 --> 44:48.445
Yes, ma'am.

44:52.998 --> 44:56.266
Borislav Jankovic
was convicted in Hague,

44:56.301 --> 44:58.872
<i>and has served</i>
<i>his sentence in Sweden</i>

44:58.908 --> 45:01.167
<i>and now here in Finland.</i>

45:01.202 --> 45:04.190
<i>Vasa is he's only surviving son.</i>
<i>Jankovic has been</i>

45:04.226 --> 45:07.040
imprisoned for years,
but this is not just about him.

45:07.076 --> 45:08.431
General Morel

45:08.466 --> 45:09.578
<i>was leader in an operation</i>

45:09.613 --> 45:12.637
<i>to catch and convict Jankovic.</i>

45:12.671 --> 45:14.861
<i>Morel is pro-NATO and promotes</i>

45:14.895 --> 45:17.851
<i>tighter sanctions</i>
<i>against Russia.</i>

45:17.885 --> 45:20.943
-Moscow.
- -<i>Cyberattacks are</i> <i>a strong indication of that.</i>

45:25.044 --> 45:26.087
I gotta go.

45:27.061 --> 45:29.007
I assume my demands
are being delivered.

45:30.606 --> 45:33.456
<i>Vasa, you have people</i>
<i>there who run my country.</i>

45:33.491 --> 45:36.097
I need to know
everybody's alive and well.

45:36.862 --> 45:41.103
After that, we can discuss
releasing your father.

45:41.137 --> 45:45.030
Did you notice I just
released several hundred people?

45:45.065 --> 45:47.880
Yes I did,
but I still need proof of life.

45:47.915 --> 45:49.861
Especially
of the President of Finland.

45:51.008 --> 45:53.024
-You'll get it.
<i>-No, I need it now.</i>

45:54.171 --> 45:55.353
<i>Don't tell me what to do.</i>

45:56.708 --> 45:58.793
Could you please
prove it to me right now?

46:14.816 --> 46:16.207
He needs to know you're okay.

46:28.407 --> 46:29.970
Satisfied?

46:30.006 --> 46:31.395
<i>Yes, for now.</i>

46:33.933 --> 46:36.713
You really think your father
was wrongly prosecuted?

46:36.748 --> 46:38.452
<i>Let's talk about my money.</i>

46:38.487 --> 46:40.433
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>he was a war criminal?</i>

46:40.467 --> 46:43.353
I want a hundred
million euros in bitcoins.

46:43.387 --> 46:45.472
<i>-A hundred million?</i>
-Yes.

46:45.507 --> 46:47.488
Vasa, I'm sure you understand...

46:48.705 --> 46:50.304
...I don't really have access

46:50.338 --> 46:52.702
to that kind
of money right away.

46:52.737 --> 46:54.544
Well, I'm sure
your Ministry of Finance

46:54.579 --> 46:55.760
will find a solution.

47:01.079 --> 47:02.886
<i>Let's just talk about this.</i>

47:02.920 --> 47:05.040
<i>No, this is non-negotiable.</i>

47:05.076 --> 47:07.335
<i>The call is disconnected.</i>

47:13.417 --> 47:14.356
Empress.

47:15.363 --> 47:16.267
Omerta.

47:16.996 --> 47:18.699
<i>Step three completed.</i>

47:18.735 --> 47:19.604
Good.

47:20.438 --> 47:21.863
We'll see
if they're good for it.

47:55.994 --> 47:57.037
Put these on.

48:20.984 --> 48:21.888
Get up.

48:25.260 --> 48:26.476
Can I get some water?

48:27.796 --> 48:29.535
No.

48:29.569 --> 48:31.030
I need to go to the bathroom.

48:31.065 --> 48:32.628
Shut the fuck up, sit down.

48:33.532 --> 48:35.791
You, up. Up!

48:36.834 --> 48:37.877
Give me your hands.

48:44.133 --> 48:45.176
Sit down.

48:51.989 --> 48:53.795
I have a question,
Mr. President.

48:59.288 --> 49:02.242
Why did you support
the illegal war in Kosovo?

49:04.153 --> 49:05.856
You were a part of it.

49:05.890 --> 49:06.968
You were responsible.

49:08.358 --> 49:11.312
-We had to agree with more
powerful European nations--
-Right.

49:11.347 --> 49:13.155
Right, EU countries.

49:14.267 --> 49:16.526
So you want Finland
to be a part of NATO?

49:18.716 --> 49:19.933
That's not my decision.

49:23.131 --> 49:25.216
Do you know my mother
was killed in Kosovo?

49:26.329 --> 49:28.310
In a humanitarian strike.

49:28.344 --> 49:29.387
Did you know that?

49:30.951 --> 49:33.383
June, 1999.

49:33.418 --> 49:35.713
Broad daylight, 70 people dead.

49:40.647 --> 49:41.865
Put your mask on.

50:51.865 --> 50:53.047
<i>Your father has landed.</i>
-Good.

50:53.081 --> 50:55.653
<i>And a plane is ready</i>
<i>at the Malmi airport.</i>

50:55.688 --> 50:56.836
And the money?

50:56.870 --> 50:59.094
<i>Your funds are</i>
<i>transferring as we speak.</i>

50:59.130 --> 51:00.936
-Okay.
<i>-We had an agreement.</i>

51:03.265 --> 51:05.386
We need you
to release the hostages.

51:07.471 --> 51:08.756
<i>You just have to trust me.</i>

53:26.152 --> 53:27.194
It's all here.

53:28.097 --> 53:29.036
We're moving.

53:30.322 --> 53:32.268
<i>I have some new</i>
<i>instructions for you.</i>

53:32.304 --> 53:34.006
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

53:34.040 --> 53:35.258
<i>The plan has changed.</i>

53:36.301 --> 53:37.517
I want you to kill him.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.603
You understand?

53:53.227 --> 53:56.182
O, watch out.
Movement on the roof.

53:59.518 --> 54:00.457
Move!

54:02.646 --> 54:03.689
Move, move.

54:04.732 --> 54:06.435
-Come on.
-Move, move.

54:06.469 --> 54:08.206
Faster, go, go, go, move!

54:10.848 --> 54:11.891
Move.

54:31.181 --> 54:32.223
Now!

55:35.898 --> 55:38.436
<i>The other stairs third floor</i>
<i>service elevator.</i>

56:01.203 --> 56:03.218
<i>Omerta, go to plan B.</i>

56:36.481 --> 56:37.523
Masks!

1:06:33.433 --> 1:06:35.274
We move. Go!

1:07:03.497 --> 1:07:04.887
Go, go, go.

1:07:17.921 --> 1:07:18.964
Keep going.

1:07:36.585 --> 1:07:38.428
Let's get this plane ready.

1:07:38.462 --> 1:07:40.132
We need to be
in air in five minutes.

1:07:48.090 --> 1:07:49.967
Get into the plane! Now!

1:07:50.002 --> 1:07:50.905
Hurry up.

1:08:11.099 --> 1:08:12.003
Stop.

1:09:23.256 --> 1:09:25.306
Keep your hands
so that I can see them.

1:09:26.834 --> 1:09:30.206
Keep your hands
so that I can see them.

1:11:17.745 --> 1:11:19.446
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:11:19.482 --> 1:11:21.116
We're on our way
to the landing zone.

1:11:21.151 --> 1:11:22.748
<i>The target is down.</i>

1:11:22.784 --> 1:11:23.896
You did good.

1:11:23.932 --> 1:11:25.321
Proceed to destination.

1:12:05.883 --> 1:12:06.542
Shut up.

1:12:18.916 --> 1:12:20.585
This is where I want
you to land.

1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:22.183
Set the course.

1:13:42.682 --> 1:13:43.619
Vasa.

1:13:43.655 --> 1:13:45.844
Get this plane in the air, now.

1:14:04.856 --> 1:14:06.907
They're flying in the dark
with the transponder off.

1:14:06.941 --> 1:14:09.653
<i>Oscar Hotel Whiskey India X-ray</i>
<i>is leaving Finnish airspace,</i>

<i>uh, to Russian airspace,</i>
<i>St. Petersburg control area.</i>

1:14:33.947 --> 1:14:35.860
Okay, we can continue.

1:14:37.145 --> 1:14:40.239
<i>A NATO AWACS plane</i>
<i>has been tracking the Falcon.</i>

1:14:44.548 --> 1:14:46.426
Belarus?

1:14:46.460 --> 1:14:48.059
So is Titov behind this?

1:14:48.094 --> 1:14:49.623
<i>It looks like it, yes.</i>

1:14:49.658 --> 1:14:51.639
<i>And Moscow's backing him up.</i>

1:14:51.673 --> 1:14:54.176
Vasa Jankovic
wanted to save his father,

1:14:54.210 --> 1:14:55.671
but I'm sure
someone else ordered

1:14:55.706 --> 1:14:57.930
the murder of your president.

1:14:57.965 --> 1:15:00.085
There's one
of our guys on the plane.

1:15:15.098 --> 1:15:16.177
I need to use the bathroom.

1:15:37.170 --> 1:15:38.353
Okay, hands up.

1:15:38.387 --> 1:15:40.577
Police! Sit down!

1:15:47.111 --> 1:15:48.465
Ah.

1:17:17.166 --> 1:17:18.695
<i>We're landing in eight minutes.</i>

1:18:26.646 --> 1:18:28.906
We know the
abductor's destination.

1:18:29.705 --> 1:18:31.443
It's an old industrial complex

1:18:31.478 --> 1:18:33.215
<i>that used to house</i>
<i>a troll factory</i>

1:18:33.251 --> 1:18:35.301
<i>during the Brexit referendum.</i>

1:18:35.336 --> 1:18:37.386
Now this part
of Belarus is unstable.

1:18:37.421 --> 1:18:38.985
It doesn't have
a reliable regime.

1:18:40.132 --> 1:18:41.696
I can't get involved officially.

1:18:41.731 --> 1:18:43.573
There's no way
I can send a strike team

1:18:43.608 --> 1:18:45.207
<i>over the border into Belarus.</i>

1:18:45.241 --> 1:18:47.327
We have an agent
and a top general there.

1:18:48.301 --> 1:18:51.289
<i>You put Sylvia</i>
<i>into this position,</i>
<i>and I need to get her out.</i>

1:18:51.324 --> 1:18:55.182
Yes, and all I can provide
is satellite surveillance

1:18:55.217 --> 1:18:57.233
and extraction from the border.

1:18:58.414 --> 1:18:59.979
No one to get me over?

1:19:00.013 --> 1:19:01.890
<i>I have Jonesy and Sinclair.</i>

1:19:01.924 --> 1:19:04.184
-Those two mercenaries.
<i>-They were part of a black op</i>

1:19:04.219 --> 1:19:06.860
<i>against the BS factory.</i>
<i>The operation never happened.</i>

1:19:07.938 --> 1:19:09.745
<i>But they do know</i>
<i>the way around the area.</i>

1:20:49.081 --> 1:20:51.062
...the unconfirmed number
of casualties is seven
at this stage.

1:20:53.286 --> 1:20:55.649
<i>Okay, Tanner.</i>
<i>We're approaching the border</i>

1:20:55.684 --> 1:20:57.735
<i>of Lithuania and Belarus.</i>

1:20:57.769 --> 1:20:58.673
<i>Prepare for landing.</i>

1:21:33.813 --> 1:21:34.994
What's the craic, Tanner?

1:21:35.030 --> 1:21:36.281
Jonesy, Sinclair.

1:21:36.315 --> 1:21:38.053
-How are you?
-You're late.

1:21:39.269 --> 1:21:41.529
This one's not gonna be
an easy money job, okay?

1:21:41.563 --> 1:21:43.476
Yeah, I'm used to it. I'm Irish.

1:21:43.510 --> 1:21:44.728
Plug my hole, Tanner.

1:21:45.909 --> 1:21:47.124
We're currently five klicks
from the border.

1:21:47.159 --> 1:21:49.418
-There's way to sneak in
by the old riverbed,

1:21:49.454 --> 1:21:51.713
but... it's tricky.

1:21:51.747 --> 1:21:53.033
After that, you're on your own.

1:21:55.988 --> 1:21:57.482
All right, let's move.

1:22:02.835 --> 1:22:03.878
Loaded and ready.

1:22:05.094 --> 1:22:06.137
The gas.

1:23:58.923 --> 1:24:00.140
Vasa Jankovic!

1:24:02.330 --> 1:24:03.719
Finally we meet.

1:24:07.091 --> 1:24:08.412
Vasa.

1:24:08.446 --> 1:24:09.629
Leonid Titov.

1:24:22.732 --> 1:24:23.843
You must be very tired?

1:24:26.729 --> 1:24:28.014
Interesting times.

1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:36.287
I'm very sorry
about your father.

1:24:40.318 --> 1:24:42.439
And I'm very sorry about this...

1:24:50.156 --> 1:24:51.649
I'm like Darth Vader.

1:24:52.796 --> 1:24:55.090
I'm changing the deal.

1:25:12.053 --> 1:25:13.859
<i>Tanner, do you read me?</i>

1:25:13.893 --> 1:25:15.944
<i>-I read you, go ahead.</i>
-Good.

1:25:15.979 --> 1:25:17.336
We have you on satellite.

1:25:17.370 --> 1:25:19.907
Aerial surveillance
shows at least

1:25:19.941 --> 1:25:22.305
three casualties on the ground.

1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:23.522
Yeah, we heard the shots.

1:25:26.859 --> 1:25:28.561
Anything else?

1:25:28.596 --> 1:25:30.472
They have backup generators,

1:25:30.508 --> 1:25:32.872
so it's no use
taking it of the power grid.

1:25:32.907 --> 1:25:34.679
<i>You'll have</i>
<i>to sneak in and improvise.</i>

1:25:34.713 --> 1:25:36.486
Yeah.

1:26:14.476 --> 1:26:15.518
Omerta.

1:26:18.541 --> 1:26:21.391
You have performed
extremely well in Finland.

1:26:27.717 --> 1:26:28.621
Cheer up.

1:26:31.854 --> 1:26:32.896
Okay?

1:26:34.565 --> 1:26:36.303
Show me the gifts you brought.

1:26:41.830 --> 1:26:43.741
Hmm.

1:27:05.673 --> 1:27:06.785
And how are you...

1:27:08.766 --> 1:27:10.538
...Agent Madsen?

1:27:15.196 --> 1:27:19.263
She's, uh, a part of European
special police force.

1:27:23.189 --> 1:27:24.232
See the bridge?

1:27:27.813 --> 1:27:29.203
Yeah.

1:27:30.245 --> 1:27:31.392
The guards patrol it.

1:27:34.416 --> 1:27:35.702
See the sewers
on the other side?

1:27:40.672 --> 1:27:42.862
That will take you straight to
the perimeter and the compound.

1:27:49.188 --> 1:27:50.406
You're on your own, son.

1:27:52.804 --> 1:27:54.054
Thanks a million.

1:27:55.548 --> 1:27:57.216
Anytime.

1:27:57.252 --> 1:27:58.572
You'll be fine, Tanner.

1:27:59.615 --> 1:28:00.833
Finland never wins...

1:28:02.465 --> 1:28:04.169
...but neither loses.

1:28:15.604 --> 1:28:18.174
<i>We've locked on to</i>
<i>agent Tanner's tracking signal.</i>

1:28:49.874 --> 1:28:51.820
There's no need to be so grumpy.

1:28:55.956 --> 1:28:58.182
And now I'm very sorry,
but I need to borrow

1:28:58.216 --> 1:29:00.821
your retina for a moment.

1:29:10.484 --> 1:29:11.806
Hmm.

1:29:11.841 --> 1:29:13.299
Thank you for your donation.

1:29:15.733 --> 1:29:16.951
And keep it straight.

1:29:18.270 --> 1:29:22.059
You understand... that I can't
be associated with terrorist.

1:30:46.449 --> 1:30:47.457
<i>Tanner, you popped up</i>

1:30:47.492 --> 1:30:48.604
on our screen again. Proceed

1:30:48.639 --> 1:30:50.445
through the doorway,
step at the wall.

1:31:18.947 --> 1:31:20.059
General Morel!

1:31:21.102 --> 1:31:23.118
Are you ready for the
statement of your life?

1:31:26.141 --> 1:31:28.158
This is the place
where you're going to declare

1:31:28.192 --> 1:31:30.243
the whole world
that you have been part

1:31:30.278 --> 1:31:33.267
of a group of ultra-right
officers, financed by Moscow.

1:31:35.282 --> 1:31:36.846
Fuck you.

1:31:39.417 --> 1:31:40.948
We had a deal, Jean.

1:31:42.894 --> 1:31:47.205
You can fuck over warlords,
dealers, hackers...

1:31:47.239 --> 1:31:50.506
...but you can't fuck
over hardline business man.

1:31:54.608 --> 1:31:55.511
Elena?

1:32:11.083 --> 1:32:13.481
<i>Cross the inner</i>
<i>courtyard heading northwest.</i>

1:32:13.515 --> 1:32:15.878
<i>-The troll factory</i>
<i>is located</i> at--

1:32:16.886 --> 1:32:20.258
Now, the server
is in the renovated
quarters at the far end

1:32:20.293 --> 1:32:21.683
<i>of the courtyard.</i>

1:32:21.718 --> 1:32:24.811
<i>Based on our intel--</i>

1:32:30.129 --> 1:32:32.874
My name is General Jean Morel.

1:32:34.161 --> 1:32:36.316
What I am about to tell you

1:32:36.351 --> 1:32:38.470
is going to be denied

1:32:38.506 --> 1:32:40.105
by the leaders of the EU.

1:32:42.016 --> 1:32:45.318
But I swear to you... it's true.

1:32:55.919 --> 1:32:57.101
<i>Tanner, do you read me?</i>

1:32:57.135 --> 1:32:59.186
Visual on Vasa Jankovic.

1:32:59.220 --> 1:33:02.176
<i>Do not expose yourself.</i>
<i>Your mission is to save Morel.</i>

1:33:04.191 --> 1:33:05.164
<i>Tanner...</i>

1:33:08.118 --> 1:33:09.056
<i>...do you read me?</i>

1:33:15.001 --> 1:33:15.973
Tanner!

1:33:53.372 --> 1:33:54.380
We made a deal.

1:33:55.701 --> 1:33:56.605
You broke it.

1:34:32.578 --> 1:34:34.629
Back off!

1:34:34.663 --> 1:34:35.636
Back off!

1:34:37.827 --> 1:34:38.730
Where are they?

1:34:42.206 --> 1:34:43.179
Next building.

1:34:46.307 --> 1:34:48.601
Who helped you?
Who helped you in Helsinki?

1:34:50.443 --> 1:34:51.416
Russians.

1:34:55.726 --> 1:34:56.804
You're gonna shoot me?

1:35:12.861 --> 1:35:14.182
Stay out of my way.

1:35:32.916 --> 1:35:35.418
Your turn... Agent Madsen.

1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:43.690
It was your son,
the boy in Tallinn?

1:35:45.534 --> 1:35:46.577
Yes.

1:35:48.696 --> 1:35:49.913
It was my Yuri.

1:35:51.824 --> 1:35:54.988
Media reported that he was
killed by thieving junkies.

1:35:59.819 --> 1:36:01.244
Are you a thieving junkie...

1:36:02.321 --> 1:36:03.224
...agent Madsen?

1:36:05.866 --> 1:36:08.021
I'm sorry about your loss.

1:36:08.056 --> 1:36:09.551
Yeah.

1:36:09.586 --> 1:36:11.740
You were just
doing your job, huh?

1:36:11.776 --> 1:36:13.201
Correct.

1:36:13.235 --> 1:36:14.799
Your job now is to tell

1:36:14.834 --> 1:36:17.371
the whole world
who is responsible.

1:36:17.406 --> 1:36:20.291
And I want all names,
agent Madsen.

1:36:20.326 --> 1:36:24.739
All EU officials who are
responsible of killing children.

1:36:25.852 --> 1:36:26.790
Read the text...

1:36:27.972 --> 1:36:30.995
...and your children
will be not harmed.

1:36:31.031 --> 1:36:32.490
I promise you.

1:36:32.526 --> 1:36:33.777
From parent to parent.

1:36:49.243 --> 1:36:50.182
Read the text.

1:37:06.309 --> 1:37:07.421
Get the gun!

1:37:13.504 --> 1:37:14.407
Let's go!

1:37:15.311 --> 1:37:16.249
Take a jacket!

1:38:53.778 --> 1:38:56.003
Hurry! Come!

1:38:56.038 --> 1:38:56.940
Take cover!

1:39:08.896 --> 1:39:10.912
Sylvia Madsen, code 612.

1:39:11.990 --> 1:39:14.492
Request is from
pinpoint location.

1:39:14.528 --> 1:39:16.057
And an immediate air support.

1:39:18.351 --> 1:39:20.192
Okay, you go that way.

1:39:52.690 --> 1:39:53.733
Tweet this.

1:40:19.766 --> 1:40:21.157
Massive data disruption detected

1:40:21.191 --> 1:40:23.486
in conjunction
with several explosions.

1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:25.953
It's Sylvia Madsen.
She's on the roof.

1:40:27.204 --> 1:40:28.178
Call in the chopper.

1:40:49.483 --> 1:40:51.047
Take cover, take cover.

1:40:52.298 --> 1:40:53.794
That side.

1:40:53.829 --> 1:40:54.696
Hide over there.

1:42:11.893 --> 1:42:13.352
Sylvia!

1:42:14.083 --> 1:42:15.471
Sylvia!

1:42:15.507 --> 1:42:18.565
Tanner, over here.

1:42:18.599 --> 1:42:20.094
He's one of us.

1:42:22.389 --> 1:42:24.510
What a surprise.

1:42:24.544 --> 1:42:26.316
It's good to see you.

1:42:26.351 --> 1:42:27.429
Good to see you.

1:42:28.681 --> 1:42:31.564
I'm guessing you had something
to do with the explosion.

1:42:31.601 --> 1:42:32.607
Yeah, I might have.

1:42:33.998 --> 1:42:34.797
<i>The chopper</i>
<i>has entered Belarusian</i>

1:42:34.833 --> 1:42:37.716

<i>Landing zone is too hot.</i>

1:43:14.211 --> 1:43:16.296
<i>Several Tangos on the roof.</i>

Smoke!

1:43:21.371 --> 1:43:22.483
Cover up!

1:43:35.414 --> 1:43:37.326
-Go, go, go, go.
-Go!

1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:38.507
Come on, let's go!

1:43:56.303 --> 1:43:58.145
Do we have the General?

1:43:58.180 --> 1:43:59.673
Primary objective secured.

1:44:03.428 --> 1:44:04.852
Come on, Tanner!

1:44:20.181 --> 1:44:22.196
<i>Heavy fire. Go! Go!</i>

1:44:24.941 --> 1:44:25.949
Wait.

1:44:29.635 --> 1:44:30.642
Don't leave him!

1:44:32.693 --> 1:44:34.152
<i>Let's circle back.</i>

1:44:34.187 --> 1:44:35.683
<i>Hold tight,</i>
<i>I'm gonna circle back.</i>

1:44:38.496 --> 1:44:39.643
<i>Warning, incoming.</i>

1:44:42.147 --> 1:44:43.676
<i>Flares fired.</i>

1:44:43.710 --> 1:44:45.276
<i>One more agent is on the roof.</i>

1:44:45.310 --> 1:44:46.179
Leave him.

1:44:47.187 --> 1:44:49.446
<i>Ghost 1, abort mission.</i>

1:44:49.481 --> 1:44:50.766
<i>Return to base.</i>

1:46:49.010 --> 1:46:53.216
Huh? Whoa.

1:46:53.251 --> 1:46:54.293
Anya.

1:50:27.318 --> 1:50:28.709
Let's take a walk.

1:50:35.278 --> 1:50:36.945
I knew somebody was gonna come.

1:50:38.022 --> 1:50:39.274
I'm just surprised it's you.

1:50:41.882 --> 1:50:43.655
I was the one who recruited you.

1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.015
And now you've come
to get rid of me.

1:50:51.822 --> 1:50:52.761
Yes.

1:51:05.273 --> 1:51:06.385
I probably deserve it.

1:51:22.095 --> 1:51:24.042
I have some friends
in Buenos Aires.

1:51:28.491 --> 1:51:29.672
They'll take care of you.

1:51:34.538 --> 1:51:37.076
Am I still gonna
get astronomically rich?

1:51:41.977 --> 1:51:43.402
No.

1:51:43.436 --> 1:51:44.444
But you'll get by.

1:51:45.973 --> 1:51:46.912
Have a good life.

1:52:28.203 --> 1:52:29.245
Max.

1:52:30.358 --> 1:52:32.096
Well, this is a surprise.

1:52:35.537 --> 1:52:36.544
It's good to see you.

1:52:43.913 --> 1:52:46.624
You want... to know
what happened in Belarus.

1:52:48.953 --> 1:52:50.482
Why did I leave you behind?

1:52:53.297 --> 1:52:55.661
Well, Tanner,
we're both professionals.

1:52:55.695 --> 1:52:58.477
We both have to do what it takes
to accomplish our missions.

1:53:00.180 --> 1:53:02.369
My job is to give orders.

1:53:02.404 --> 1:53:04.072
Your job is to follow them.

1:53:08.731 --> 1:53:11.337
Why did they kill our president?

1:53:11.372 --> 1:53:13.632
Your president
shapes Finnish opinions.

1:53:15.647 --> 1:53:18.845
And he was making preparations
for Finland to join NATO.

1:53:19.992 --> 1:53:23.711
The powers behind Titov
wanted to delay this
in any way possible.

1:53:24.510 --> 1:53:25.588
Titov got away.

1:53:27.569 --> 1:53:28.994
We'll get him eventually.

1:53:30.141 --> 1:53:31.532
And Vasa Jankovic?

1:53:33.652 --> 1:53:36.432
Once used, he was expendable.

1:53:49.362 --> 1:53:50.265
So, Tanner...

1:53:52.559 --> 1:53:54.054
...you're ready
to get back to work?

1:54:27.803 --> 1:54:29.540
I know now is not a
good time, but...

1:54:30.931 --> 1:54:31.973
...we need to talk.

1:54:34.024 --> 1:54:36.110
Well, Max Tanner...

1:54:37.882 --> 1:54:40.107
...nothing is impossible.
