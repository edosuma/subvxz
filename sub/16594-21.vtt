00:01.334 --> 00:03.569
<i>Previously on</i> MacGyver...

00:03.571 --> 00:05.471
No one's ever
survived me before.

00:05.473 --> 00:06.572
I still don't know your name.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.141
I've always been partial
to Murdoc.

00:09.143 --> 00:12.077
I know everything there is
to know about you, Daniel.

00:12.079 --> 00:15.047
But what you don't know
is that I wanted to be caught.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.348
WOMAN:
<i>If anyone is getting this,</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:19.218
Looks like Ebola.
Is it something new?

00:19.220 --> 00:21.086
THORNTON: <i>Try something old.</i>
<i>30,000 years old.</i>

00:21.088 --> 00:24.390
<i>We believe this virus</i>
<i>is the biological weapon.</i>

00:24.392 --> 00:26.558
MacGYVER: <i>Stopping the bomb</i>
<i>is out of the question.</i>
<i>JACK:</i> <i>Then get the virus</i>

00:26.560 --> 00:27.793
and get out of there!

00:34.434 --> 00:38.137
(man singing call to prayer)

00:47.280 --> 00:49.715
(muffled grunting)
JACK: ♪ Now, when he was
a young man ♪

00:49.717 --> 00:51.717
♪ He never thought he'd see

00:51.719 --> 00:55.220

01:11.072 --> 01:13.338
Yeah. That's... I-I don't
know the rest of the words.

01:13.340 --> 01:16.208
I do know he had a condo
made of stone-a.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.343
Focus, Jack. We need to find
this thing, all right?

01:18.345 --> 01:19.645
So, I don't get it.
What's the deal

01:19.647 --> 01:20.646
with all the cats?

01:20.648 --> 01:23.082
Cats were
known as Mau,

01:23.084 --> 01:26.251
and they were sacred in
ancient Egyptian civilizations.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.620
Some were known as gods
and goddesses, actually.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.689
One good dog would've
taken care of all that.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.224
Anubis there,
he was part dog.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.226
Really? That's one ugly mutt.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.497
(creaking)

01:38.499 --> 01:41.300
Oh. (chuckles)

01:42.836 --> 01:45.270
Mac, my mummy thinks
you're hot.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.238
Stop it.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.709
Oh, so what? Mummy, can
my friend come over for dinner?

01:50.711 --> 01:52.678
Put it back.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.413
Okay, fine.
I'm glad you can find
the humor in this.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.115
Like being on a mission
with an eight-year-old.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.649
Well, of course I'm gonna find
the humor in it, bro.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.352
What, would you rather me
be curled up in the corner

02:00.354 --> 02:02.154
in the fetal position,
soiling my adult diapers?

02:02.156 --> 02:03.822
Now, wait a second.
Mac, Mac.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.491
Don't-don't touch
this one, okay?

02:05.493 --> 02:07.659
It looks like
the Ark of the Covenant.
(sighs)

02:07.661 --> 02:11.563
No, s-seriously, I don't want
my face to melt off.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.333
Look away.
Okay, it's your funeral.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.337
No, it's all our funerals.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.141
Oh, Yahtzee.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.276
Dirty bomb.
Just like Thornton said.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.645
(phone ringing)

02:26.647 --> 02:28.580
It's fine.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.249
It's Bozer.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.450
That's, like, the fifth time
he's called.
I know.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.452
Well, answer it.
It might be important.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.920
And this isn't?

02:34.922 --> 02:37.689
You might be right. It's
a... it's a video call.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.758
I got to go find a
background that doesn't look

02:39.760 --> 02:42.461
like I'm inside of a...
well, wherever we are.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.230
This better be important.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.700
Hey, man.
BOZER: Hey.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.302
About time you picked up.
You have any idea

02:50.304 --> 02:52.237
how late I am for work?
Any chance that,

02:52.239 --> 02:53.672
uh, this can wait
and I can call you back?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.474
You forgetting something?
MacGYVER: Boze, I'm, uh...

02:55.476 --> 02:57.543
I'm busy right now.
Man, so am I, man.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.745
And it was your turn
to buy the Honey Nut Cheerios.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.313
Oh, yeah.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.315
I, um... I forgot to do that.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.851
I'm-I'm sorry. I'll do that
as soon as I get back

03:05.853 --> 03:08.487
Just give me
your Amazon password

03:08.489 --> 03:10.722
and I'll order more.
I also need to order some meats

03:10.724 --> 03:12.257
and cheeses...
(vehicles approaching)

03:12.259 --> 03:14.293
Cut it off, man.
Farhad's men found us.

03:14.295 --> 03:14.960
(men shouting in distance)

03:14.962 --> 03:16.528
What? How?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.896
I don't know. They must've
tracked your cell phone.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.599
I thought Nikki was
blocking our signal.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.800
Well, you thought wrong.
And I'm hiding.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.868
I suggest you do the same.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.705
(men shouting
in foreign language)

03:30.777 --> 03:33.212
(shouting in foreign language)

03:39.719 --> 03:42.354
(shouting in
foreign language)

03:44.524 --> 03:45.657
(speaks foreign language)

03:50.897 --> 03:51.863
(speaks foreign language)

03:53.733 --> 03:55.467
MacGYVER: I wouldn't do that
if I were you!

03:55.469 --> 03:57.402
(steady beeping)

03:59.305 --> 04:01.640
You got two options, Farhad.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.276
One, leave.

04:04.278 --> 04:07.713
Or, two... we all die.

04:08.681 --> 04:11.550
(chuckling)

04:12.852 --> 04:14.519
Thank you, MacGyver.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.421
You just did our job for us.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.026
Our plan was always to detonate
the bomb here in Cairo.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.328
All you've done is
accelerate our clock.

04:23.330 --> 04:26.331
Unfortunately, you won't be
alive to see the thousands

04:26.333 --> 04:28.300
of people you've killed
with that bluff.

04:28.302 --> 04:31.503
With all the people
in the streets,

04:31.505 --> 04:34.473
it'll have an even bigger impact
than we could have imagined.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.278
So perhaps this little uprising
is good for something after all.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.546
(beeping continues)

04:41.548 --> 04:42.381

♪

05:07.840 --> 05:09.508
JACK:
<i>Yo, Mac!</i>

05:11.077 --> 05:12.511
Where you at?

05:14.347 --> 05:16.481
There you are.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.083
(chuckles)
Look what I got us

05:18.085 --> 05:22.487
to celebrate not getting shot,
nuked, snake-bit,

05:22.489 --> 05:25.524
or flambéed in that vortex
of death, Cairo.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.592
Your eighth favorite meal.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.660
I'm not really hungry.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.329
Don't worry about it.
You will be

05:30.331 --> 05:32.364
when you see the giant
Egyptian pyramid of food

05:32.366 --> 05:33.865
I'm about to throw at ya.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.703
I got kebabs, koftas, pita,
that-that garlic sauce

05:37.705 --> 05:40.038
that gives you the bubble guts--
you like that.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.907
And, look, baba ghanoush.

05:41.909 --> 05:46.044
Lots and lots
of baba ghanoush.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.080
That's...

05:48.082 --> 05:49.614
Wh-Why are you
not happy about this?

05:49.616 --> 05:52.484
Remember this?

05:52.486 --> 05:54.619
Is that the letter
you sent to your old man?

05:54.621 --> 05:56.088
Yeah. Never made it to him.

05:56.090 --> 05:59.424
No way. Let me see that.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.426
Looks like it's been

06:01.428 --> 06:03.662
halfway around the world
and back.
Exactly.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.098
So if that can't find him,
I don't know how I'm going to.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.900
Okay. If you really want to find
him, I'll go with you. I'm down.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.103
I mean, I'm the one who told you
to write the letter

06:11.105 --> 06:12.404
in the first place, right?

06:12.406 --> 06:16.108
some ghanoush,
start fresh tomorrow.
(phone chimes)

06:16.110 --> 06:17.476
What do you say?
(phone chimes)

06:17.478 --> 06:19.444
Oh, Matty needs us.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.012
No, no. Wait, wait,
wait. No, no way.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.014
No way, Mac. No, no.
We have a rule now.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.950
We-we made a pact, remember?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.051
We have a job.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.587
Not-not today we don't.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.621
Not on Cairo Day.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.590
364 days out of the year,

06:31.592 --> 06:35.994
we work, but on one day,
one day, we don't.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.530
That day is today. And you know
that. You know that, why?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.999
Because it's bad luck.

06:41.001 --> 06:44.503
Scientifically speaking,
there's no such thing.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.641
Bad luck.
Bad luck. Right.
I agree with you.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.410
We're not taking
any missions today. Good idea.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.944
(scoffs)

06:52.946 --> 06:54.446
Oh, but it's not a mission.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.180
Learn how to read.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.181
I know how to...

06:56.183 --> 06:57.549
I know how to read.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.551
Then why the hell
is she calling us in?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.953
MATTY:
<i>I'd like you all to welcome</i>

07:01.955 --> 07:04.055
the newest member of
our Phoenix team,

07:04.057 --> 07:06.091
Dr. Milton Zito.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.560
Dr. Zito is an expert
in metamaterials.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.628
He'll be working

07:09.630 --> 07:11.496
on a research
project in our lab.

07:11.498 --> 07:15.200
I look forward to
working with all of you.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.569
Especially you,
Mr. MacGyver.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.905
I've heard all about
your unique abilities.

07:19.907 --> 07:23.508
In an age of specialists, it's
rare to meet a Renaissance man.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.043
MacGYVER: Oh. Welcome
to the Phoenix Foundation...

07:25.045 --> 07:26.144
JACK:
Jack Dalton.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.180
I'm the guy who made
the Kessel Run

07:28.182 --> 07:29.948
in less than 12 parsecs.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.551
You do know parsecs

07:32.553 --> 07:34.653
are a measure of distance,
not time?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.955
Yeah, we keep
telling him that.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.590
Just like we keep telling him
monster hologram chess

07:38.592 --> 07:40.158
isn't a thing.
JACK: Not yet, Bozer.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.660
Not yet.
Just because you wink

07:41.662 --> 07:44.129
doesn't make it a thing.
You did it again.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.530
Now I'm uncomfortable.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.032
Dr. Zito,
please ignore Jack.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.601
He's been...
blown up a lot.

07:49.603 --> 07:53.472
Bozer, would you please
escort Dr. Zito to the lab

07:53.474 --> 07:55.006
and make sure he has
everything he needs?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.508
You got it, boss.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.544
And the vending machine
on the third floor has

07:59.546 --> 08:01.112
the best candy, but
be careful up there.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.981
Cal from Cryptography
will talk your ear off.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.083
There's nothing wrong
with a little small talk.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.585
Lab work can be lonely.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.220
You're telling me.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.888
Where did you study, by the way?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.623
Stanford? Yale?

08:11.625 --> 08:16.661
at film school and a few weeks
with a private acting coach.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.198
Dr. Zito, I presume.

08:20.200 --> 08:25.203
The artificial intelligence
project you mentioned.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.204
It's amazing.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.272
It ain't <i>Westworld,</i>

08:27.274 --> 08:29.541
but, uh, we do our best.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.576
Sparky's great for
kicking around ideas.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.179
Like your idea
to ask Lil out for sushi.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.249
I've run the computations and
your success rate would be...

08:37.251 --> 08:38.750
Oh, hey, man.
Let's, uh...

08:38.752 --> 08:40.285
let's keep that one
between us, all right?

08:40.287 --> 08:41.786
He knows everything
on Wikipedia,

08:41.788 --> 08:43.255
but we're still
working on boundaries.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.557
...15%.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.659
I'm afraid
you'll be dining alone.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.596
But the one thing
you don't know,

08:51.598 --> 08:54.599
Matilda Webber,

08:54.601 --> 08:56.902
is that I wanted
to be caught.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.169
(monitor beeps)

08:58.171 --> 09:00.572
So after a week
of interrogation,

09:00.574 --> 09:04.242
we still have no idea what this
guy does for The Organization.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.745
Or what the hell that means.
MacGYVER: Well, the fact that

09:06.747 --> 09:08.113
he's not talking suggests
he's still loyal to...

09:08.115 --> 09:10.615
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
stop you both right there.

09:10.617 --> 09:13.552
sounds like the start
of a mission.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.786
And you don't
know this, Matty,

09:14.788 --> 09:17.122
'cause you're new,
so I'll fill you in,

09:17.124 --> 09:18.590
but today...
Is the anniversary

09:18.592 --> 09:21.026
of the disastrous mission
in Cairo,

09:21.028 --> 09:21.993
and you're superstitious

09:21.995 --> 09:23.261
about working.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.163
Yes.
Just suck it up.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.898
Put your big boy pants on.
Okay.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.166
We have a lot
of work to do.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.702
I have a Detective Molina
on the phone

09:30.704 --> 09:31.703
from New York City.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.204
Put him on speaker.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.606
(tablet beeps)

09:34.608 --> 09:36.041
Detective, how can I help you?

09:36.043 --> 09:38.777
Ms. Webber, I'm reaching out
regarding a homicide case

09:38.779 --> 09:41.580
The victim had
your name and number

09:41.582 --> 09:43.248
in his recent calls,
which is why I'm contacting you.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.749
Ooh, very bad luck.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.152
It's very impressive.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.154
BOZER: It's a new polymer
I've been working on.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.989
Moves like real skin.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.924
It's incredibly
lifelike, Wilt.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.726
Yeah. It looks great.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.895
Now I just need
to make it waterproof.

09:56.897 --> 09:57.996
Colleague of mine told me

09:57.998 --> 09:59.264
you were very skilled
at prosthetics.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.004
What are you?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.106
MOLINA: And when we searched
his e-mails, we found

10:08.108 --> 10:09.908
a one-way plane ticket.
He was supposed to fly

10:09.910 --> 10:11.643
to Los Angeles last night.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.044
What was the victim's name?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.779
Uh, Dr. Milton Zito.

10:15.881 --> 10:16.815
Go.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.720
What'd I tell you, man?!
It's Cairo Day!

10:21.722 --> 10:24.789
ROBOT: Medical attention needed.
Medical attention needed.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.826
Medical attention needed.
(Bozer gasping)

10:27.828 --> 10:31.062
Medical attention needed.
Medical attention needed.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.665
Hey, slow your breathing down,
if you can. I know it's hard.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.201
(gasping)

10:37.169 --> 10:39.104
Hang on, buddy.
Hang on.
Zito.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.177
Oh, my God, Bozer.
How's he doing?

10:46.179 --> 10:48.079
MacGYVER: Not great.
Good news is,

10:48.081 --> 10:50.115
his vital organs;
but the bad news is,

10:50.117 --> 10:51.683
if I don't seal this wound

10:51.685 --> 10:52.884
right now, he's
gonna bleed out.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.219
Now, Riley, I
need your help.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.855
Push hard on this.
Harder than you'd think, okay?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.056
Okay.
Find Zito.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.724
Yeah, I'm on it.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.226
Yeah, it's Jack Dalton.
We have a hostile on site.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.260
Shut the building down
right now.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.329
I want every
available operative

11:04.331 --> 11:06.097
to meet me in the Tac room,
right now.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.733
I'll find him.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.069
MATTY: Riley, come with me.
I don't want to leave him.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.171
BOZER:
Riley.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.007
Go get that son of a bitch.

11:17.276 --> 11:18.109
Go.

11:23.315 --> 11:24.949
Hey, Mac.
Yeah?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.185
You see that?
See what?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.287
What she did with my hand.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.822
She was holding it.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.124
Please don't let me die
before I get to kiss her.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.360
(screams)
Sorry, sorry.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.461
I know, buddy.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.064
JACK:
Okay, gentlemen.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.066
This is a hard target search.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.767
Every floor, every office.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.703
As of this moment,
everyone in this room

11:44.705 --> 11:46.771
has a blind security clearance.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.339
This target could be anywhere.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.276
we don't know
what he looks like.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.912
But we do know
that attacking Wilt Bozer

11:53.914 --> 11:56.881
was not his end game,
he was just the obstacle.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.883
So whatever this guy
has planned,

11:58.885 --> 12:01.753
it ends right here, right now.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.956
Mac, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.058
Some days, this job sucks.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.294
This is one of those days.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.330
I never got stabbed
flipping burgers.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.032
Having second thoughts?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.233
What do you think?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.268
You know I trust you, Mac,

12:17.270 --> 12:18.470
but have you ever
done this before?

12:18.472 --> 12:19.904
Not even once, pal.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.740
But I have no choice;
I got to seal the wound.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.909
And you're using what, exactly?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.779
Uh, Polyol and
diisocyanates.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.014
Army medics are
working on this

12:30.016 --> 12:34.419
When the two chemicals get
inside the wound, they harden.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.787
It's fascinating.
N-Never mind.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.222
Just-just do it.
Sorry.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.390
ROBOT:
Very impressive, Mr. MacGyver.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.495
BOZER:
You're such a kiss-ass.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.330
Okay, uh...

12:45.931 --> 12:47.265
Sorry.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.900
(groaning)
All right, man.

12:51.137 --> 12:53.938
Heads up, this
is gonna hurt.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.107
A lot.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.276
ROBOT:
Happy thoughts, Mr. Bozer.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.278
(groaning)

13:00.280 --> 13:01.980
(gasping, grunting)

13:06.285 --> 13:08.319
It's working.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.420
(gasping)

13:10.990 --> 13:14.292
Please tell me that
turned me into Iron Man.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.261
Just got to find
a way to... get you up,

13:16.263 --> 13:20.131
I'll wait while you make
a teleportation machine.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.866
(MacGyver chuckles)
ROBOT: Might I suggest

13:21.868 --> 13:24.269
using one of
the rolling tables as a gurney?

13:26.205 --> 13:27.405
Think Sparky's
gunning for your job.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.374
It's not a bad idea.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.178
JACK:
Basement level two clear.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.345
Moving down to three.
Uh, Matty?

13:35.281 --> 13:36.881
Someone just opened
the holding door

13:36.883 --> 13:38.049
in the interrogation wing.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.319
Jack, you got any men
on that floor?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.087
Negative.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.222
Zito.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.458
I think I know
where he's headed.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.860
(keypad beeps, lock clicks)

13:57.369 --> 13:59.204
They said you'd be punctual.
They were right.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.340
You ready to do your thing?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.575
Always.

14:03.577 --> 14:06.978
Of course. They were
kind enough to give me a tour.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.917
Just lost cameras
in interrogation.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.152
Jack, get down there now.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.489
Check the room.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.029
Uh, we've got an agent down.

14:25.031 --> 14:29.033
And no sign of Dr. Zito
or Mr. Organization.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.135
Well, I guess now we know
why he wanted to get caught.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.037
He had to be
inside the building.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.339
These two are
working together.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.340
Question is: why?

14:35.342 --> 14:37.275
I don't know, and I don't care.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.043
But I think I did
just figure out a way

14:39.045 --> 14:40.979
to I.D. the S.O.B.
Riley?

14:40.981 --> 14:41.980
(camera clicks)
Incoming.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.019
Okay.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.456
The fake Dr. Zito is
actually Jason Tennant--

14:51.458 --> 14:52.357
former SAS,

14:52.359 --> 14:54.459
'93 to '98.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.927
Left to join a private
military company,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.161
did some work as a mercenary.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.596
Eventually caught
running guns

14:58.598 --> 15:00.498
in Somalia and was thrown
in a hole there

15:00.500 --> 15:02.433
until the U.S.
extradited him in '02.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.903
And he spent the last 15 years
locked away here.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.307
That's where we keep...
Yeah.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.242
And their cells were
right next to each other.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.220
Matilda. Riley.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.956
Such a pleasure to see you both.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.058
Though I wasn't
expecting your call

15:27.060 --> 15:31.129
Then your plan is falling apart
ahead of schedule, Murdoc.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.664
What the hell is going on?

15:32.666 --> 15:35.133
Oh, just...

15:35.135 --> 15:38.336
picking up where things
left off in that junkyard.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.539
See, I was hoping
to fulfill my dream

15:41.541 --> 15:47.145
of murdering every last one of
you Phoenix agents personally.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.479
Then it dawned on me,

15:48.481 --> 15:51.516
I'm probably never
going to get out of here.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.518
So, I got to chitchatting
with my neighbor Jason

15:53.520 --> 15:55.453
in the next cell over,
told him all about you.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.955
RILEY:
So you expect us to believe

15:56.957 --> 15:58.289
you just whispered
in some dude's ear

15:58.291 --> 15:59.657
and he agreed
to take on

15:59.659 --> 16:01.125
all of Phoenix?

16:02.394 --> 16:04.429
Oh, it took more
than whispers, Riley.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.431
See, I agreed to pay him

16:06.433 --> 16:10.735
$30 million and to teach him
everything that I know.

16:10.737 --> 16:14.105
He agreed to corpse-ify
all of you.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.273
See, what I taught MacGyver,

16:15.275 --> 16:18.276
ooh, that was just
the tip of the iceberg.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.678
What I taught
my one-time neighbor...

16:20.680 --> 16:24.749
well, let's just say
I gave him a PhD...

16:24.751 --> 16:26.417
in homicide.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.286
(grunting)

16:37.296 --> 16:39.397
MATTY:
Okay, while that's a cute story,

16:39.399 --> 16:41.132
Murdoc, it has some holes.

16:41.134 --> 16:45.103
why did he release the man
who worked for The Organization?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.537
Whoa. Whoa.
Someone's in our network.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.139
They're taking over
the entire...

16:48.640 --> 16:50.541
(alarm blaring)

16:50.543 --> 16:52.176
(Bozer groaning)

16:52.178 --> 16:53.244
(alarm ringing)

16:53.246 --> 16:56.114
(alarm blaring)

17:00.152 --> 17:01.185
Can you stop them?

17:01.187 --> 17:02.353
I'm trying.
Look, they just put

17:02.355 --> 17:05.590
All exits are sealed
and I can't access anything.

17:08.093 --> 17:10.328
They're in control
of the Phoenix now.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.468
MATTY: Post guards
at every stairwell.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.636
I want six
four-men tac teams

17:18.638 --> 17:19.670
clearing the building
from the top down.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.671
Where's Mac?

17:20.673 --> 17:22.073
He took Bozer to
the loading dock

17:22.075 --> 17:23.174
to hand him off to EMS,

17:23.176 --> 17:25.143
but that's before
this all happened.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.110
Can you find him
on any of our cameras?

17:26.112 --> 17:27.345
I can't even access our cameras.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.413
I'm locked out of everything.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.716
How long before that can happen?
I don't know.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.451
Dude from The Organization
is good.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.786
He didn't just
change our passwords,

17:34.788 --> 17:36.220
he reconfigured
the whole damn system.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.321
The only way to do

17:37.323 --> 17:38.656
this kind of damage
is to hard-wire

17:38.658 --> 17:42.560
If you want me to fix this,
that's where I need to be.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.828
Then let's get you there.
Let's go.

17:53.305 --> 17:54.672
Mac.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.606
Yeah?

17:55.608 --> 17:58.676
I don't want to die.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.079
You're not gonna die, Boze.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.082
(grunting)

18:04.084 --> 18:06.150
(doors creaking)

18:20.265 --> 18:22.300
(keypad beeping)

18:22.302 --> 18:24.569
We don't have all day.
Just boopidee-boop the thing.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.504
Yeah, if I could boopidee-boop
it, we wouldn't be standing here

18:26.506 --> 18:28.239
talking about how I could
just boopidee-boop it.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.475
Huh? What kind of twisted,
circular logic is that, huh?

18:30.477 --> 18:32.210
You trying to give me-- no,
you're giving me a headache.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.580
I need to be hardwired into the
data center to fix this thing.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.281
If they locked this door,
they locked every other door

18:37.283 --> 18:38.349
on the floor.

18:40.686 --> 18:41.886
All right.

18:41.888 --> 18:45.289
What? The greenhouse?
Yeah, yeah, the greenhouse.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.291
Well, Jack is now the best time
to get into horticulture?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.726
First of all,
there's no reason to talk me

18:48.728 --> 18:50.128
with that kind of
foul language, okay?

18:50.130 --> 18:54.265
you'd be halfway there
right now, and you know it.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.267
Okay, yeah.
But you are not Mac.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.136
I know that.
Thank you, Riley.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.604
How do you think I came up
with the greenhouse idea, huh?

18:59.606 --> 19:01.305
All you got to do is
think like that dork

19:01.307 --> 19:03.307
and then mentally delete
all the jibber-jabber.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.343
Okay, fine, yeah.
Got it. Let's go.
Driving me nuts.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.277
Sorry.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.746
(groaning)

19:08.748 --> 19:11.249
(gasping)

19:12.251 --> 19:13.885
(panting)

19:15.654 --> 19:17.889
(distorted, echoing):
I'll be right back.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.269
Okay, buddy,
let's get you up in here.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.273
So your plan is what?

19:35.275 --> 19:37.475
Charm the killers
who took over the Phoenix

19:37.477 --> 19:40.878
Ooh, that's a good idea,
and would probably work,

19:40.880 --> 19:44.448
but I just kind of figured
we blow stuff up instead.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.850
Huh?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.618
Yeah, you said the data center's
on the other side

19:47.620 --> 19:49.220
of this wall, right?
Yeah.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.721
Well, I've seen Mac
make enough bombs

19:50.723 --> 19:54.225
that I'm... fairly confident
I can get us through.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.526
"Fairly confident"?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.861
Yeah, Riley, relax.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.263
Trust me, I got this.
I just need some, uh...

19:59.265 --> 20:00.498
MATTY:
How is he?

20:01.667 --> 20:03.367
Starting to
think Dr. Zito

20:03.369 --> 20:04.835
wasn't such a good hire.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.838
Jack, please tell me
you're in data by now.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.408
We will be as soon as we're done
making these fertilizer grenades

20:10.410 --> 20:12.543
to blow a hole in the wall
between the greenhouse

20:12.545 --> 20:13.878
and the data center.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.913
And before
you ask why, Matty,

20:15.915 --> 20:18.316
the magnetic doors are locked,
it's the only way in.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.517
Is that really gonna work?

20:19.519 --> 20:22.253
I mean, it's almost exactly
what I would do.

20:22.255 --> 20:25.323
May I? Jack, you're gonna
need more than just grenades

20:25.325 --> 20:28.926
Okay, but it is
a good idea, right?

20:28.928 --> 20:31.929
Yeah, but, uh, we're gonna
have to tweak it a little bit.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.332
(mouthing)
I'm only giving
you partial credit.

20:34.334 --> 20:38.669
so upend two of those metal
tables that the plants are on

20:38.671 --> 20:40.438
and place them in an "L" shape
up against the wall.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.242
And, uh,

20:44.244 --> 20:45.543
use chains from the grow lights

20:45.545 --> 20:47.645
to secure them in place.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.683
Toss your incendiaries inside,
and then, uh, light them up

20:52.685 --> 20:53.818
and run like hell.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.589
Are you sure that letting Jack
play with explosives is really

20:58.591 --> 20:59.590
the best idea?

20:59.592 --> 21:03.294
Hey, Jack, do not blow up
anything until I get there.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.362
I'm coming to help.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.831
Bozer,

21:06.833 --> 21:09.333
if you die,

21:09.335 --> 21:10.468
you're fired.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.869
Yes, ma'am.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.675
(grunting)

21:29.554 --> 21:30.688
(laughs)

21:38.430 --> 21:40.498
Are you sure this
is far enough?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.832
We're about to find
that out, aren't we?

21:41.834 --> 21:44.335
Okay, well, don't you think
we should wait on Mac?

21:44.337 --> 21:46.504
We're kind of on the clock
here, Riles. Don't worry.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.339
Jack-Gyver's got it
all figured out.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.607
What?

21:49.609 --> 21:50.908
All you did
was follow Mac's instructions.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.543
And don't ever say
"Jack-Gyver..." (grunts)

22:01.853 --> 22:03.454
Okay, let's go,
let's go.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.523
Try not to hit
the servers, all right?

22:05.525 --> 22:06.991
They're kind of important.
Yeah, noted.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.459
Okay, do your thing.
Do your thing.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.827
I'll go find The Client.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.701
(both grunting)

22:35.520 --> 22:36.854
A marker?

22:37.989 --> 22:39.824
I'm disappointed, MacGyver.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.792
Murdoc spent hours
telling me everything

22:41.794 --> 22:43.961
about you and your
impressive skills,

22:43.963 --> 22:45.496
and you're fighting
me... (gasps)

22:45.498 --> 22:46.931
(screams)
How 'bout now?

22:51.069 --> 22:53.504
Impressed yet?

22:56.775 --> 23:00.444
(alarm sounding)

23:28.473 --> 23:30.508
(screams)

23:43.622 --> 23:44.989
(yells)

24:08.713 --> 24:12.216
Murdoc didn't just tell me
your strengths.

24:12.218 --> 24:16.620
He also taught me
your weaknesses.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.491
By the way, how is dear old Dad?

24:25.030 --> 24:26.597
(gunshot)

24:27.933 --> 24:28.999
JACK:
Riley!

24:32.604 --> 24:34.038
JACK:
Riley!

24:34.040 --> 24:35.473
MacGYVER:
Riley.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.543
Hey, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

24:43.515 --> 24:44.682
Riley, are you okay?

24:44.684 --> 24:46.517
Huh? You all right?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.552
Hey, talk to me.
Talk to me.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.654
Yeah, we...

24:50.656 --> 24:52.490
we were fighting for the gun.
The gun.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.725
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
You did what you had to do.
Just...

24:54.727 --> 24:55.860
It's okay.

24:57.696 --> 24:58.896
It's okay. Give it up.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.598
All right?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.166
Now give it to me.

25:06.872 --> 25:10.741
I got to get back to work.

25:15.213 --> 25:16.280
(shell casing clatters on floor)

25:19.017 --> 25:20.551
Um, how much time do you need?

25:21.686 --> 25:24.722
Um, it'll take days...

25:24.724 --> 25:26.991
to get the whole system back.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.692
But I think I got us our eyes.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.528
Good.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.062
All we got to do now
is find Dr. Zito.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.998
And deal with them.

25:36.701 --> 25:37.735
Great.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.604
The Organization
just sent an army.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.740
Cairo Day, man.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.743
Always call in sick
on Cairo Day, always.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.318
I don't get it.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.554
If the Organization sent
Zito here for something,

25:56.556 --> 25:57.788
why send all that backup?

25:57.790 --> 25:59.857
We'll answer all those questions
over a cold one,

25:59.859 --> 26:02.159
if we're still alive, Riley,

26:02.161 --> 26:04.261
but in the meantime,
we just need to know

26:04.263 --> 26:06.597
where the bad guys are.
They're heading east.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.632
Down the next hall
on your right.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.768
(door shuts)

26:15.173 --> 26:17.174
Oh, great.
Riley, any chance you can
help us out with this?

26:17.176 --> 26:20.110
No.
The cameras are ours,

26:20.112 --> 26:21.845
but I'm still locked out
of everything else.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.715
But they aren't.
They're, um... they're...

26:29.254 --> 26:31.589
"They're, um..." what, Riley?

26:31.591 --> 26:32.957
JACK: Are you okay?
I'm fine.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.892
Their inside man reconfigured
our security codes

26:34.894 --> 26:36.293
to work with their master key.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.929
Well, can't you just make one?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.798
No. Not yet.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.866
And don't ask why, Jack.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.168
You wouldn't understand
my explanation.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.669
<i>No problemo, señorita.</i>

26:45.671 --> 26:48.973
I have my own master key
right here-- <i>mi hermano.</i>

26:48.975 --> 26:50.908
What's the plan?
It's gonna take too long

26:50.910 --> 26:52.209
to make something to cut through
this, so we got to go around.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.044
Well, if we're gonna
go around,

26:54.046 --> 26:55.012
we're gonna have to move
really fast.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.981
Move very, very, fast? Yeah.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.722
Uh, guys, looks like they're
headed to level B9.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.724
That's Cold Storage.
RILEY: What's in Cold Storage?

27:06.726 --> 27:08.392
MacGYVER:
You know all the dangerous stuff
we get on missions?

27:08.394 --> 27:11.261
Well, that's where
they put it.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.199
(grunts)

27:15.201 --> 27:17.001
You know, when I
woke up this morning,

27:17.003 --> 27:19.770
not chasing a bunch
of psychopaths around

27:19.772 --> 27:21.939
with machine guns,
dodging bullets.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.707
I'm telling you, Mac,

27:23.709 --> 27:26.844
never doubt the Cairo
curse, my man, never!

27:26.846 --> 27:28.779
Alliteration doesn't
make it true, Jack.

27:28.781 --> 27:29.980
Hey, the fact that this
is all happening

27:29.982 --> 27:31.281
is what makes it
true, dum-dum.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.125
What are you doing here?
MATTY: Get to B9.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.926
We got this.

27:51.236 --> 27:53.303
Okay, come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.105
I don't mean to tell you
how to count, Mac,

27:55.107 --> 27:56.940
but we're on B8,
they're on level B9.

27:56.942 --> 27:59.276
Even if we could make it
through all the locked doors,

27:59.278 --> 28:01.011
which we can't,

28:01.013 --> 28:02.012
I don't like the odds
of two against nine.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.080
That's why we're here.

28:04.249 --> 28:06.450
What are you doing?

28:06.452 --> 28:07.685
What are you doing?

28:07.687 --> 28:10.454
I need...

28:10.456 --> 28:14.058
a baseball-sized hole
right there.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.260
Yeah, right there.
Okay, but when Matty asks me

28:16.262 --> 28:18.128
why there's a big-ass
hole in her floor,

28:18.130 --> 28:19.463
I'm gonna tell her
it was your idea.

28:32.778 --> 28:36.246
Are you gonna melt a hole
in the floor, like <i>Aliens?</i>

28:36.248 --> 28:38.015
Uh, no.
I thought about that,

28:38.017 --> 28:39.249
but it wouldn't work
fast enough.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.751
This is nitromethane,

28:40.753 --> 28:42.119
that's ethylendiamine.

28:42.121 --> 28:46.056
The, uh, Phoenix techs
use this stuff to make

28:46.058 --> 28:49.059
custom electronics.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.461
But when you mix
a little of this

28:50.463 --> 28:52.496
with a little of that,

28:52.498 --> 28:55.766
you get a binary liquid
explosive called PLX.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.401
And when you put
an explosive

28:57.403 --> 28:59.103
in a contained space,

28:59.105 --> 29:01.205
say between two
iron I-beams...

29:01.207 --> 29:04.742
Ah, you get a badass bomb.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.244
Put your foot down
right there.

29:11.516 --> 29:13.517
So, we're gonna light the fuse,

29:13.519 --> 29:15.953
we're gonna run
towards the explosion.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.889
Run towards the explosion?
Yeah.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.524
This is exactly the kind
of plan that made me

29:20.526 --> 29:22.459
not want to come
to work today.

29:22.461 --> 29:26.029
We'll be fine, probably.

29:26.031 --> 29:28.165
(Jack crying out)

29:37.008 --> 29:39.143
Okay. Okay, Riley said
12, that's three.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.778
Matty took out three,
so we're looking at, uh...

29:40.780 --> 29:42.146
Six. It's six, Jack.
Not including Zito.

29:42.148 --> 29:44.381
Technically, that's seven.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.157
Glad to see
you're still alive, Bozer.

29:53.159 --> 29:57.828
Just...
following orders, boss.

29:58.863 --> 30:01.265
Carter, gather
all non-combat personnel

30:01.267 --> 30:02.833
and get them on this level now.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.468
Yes, ma'am.
Riley,

30:04.470 --> 30:07.171
any luck finding
the good doctor?

30:07.173 --> 30:10.974
Nope. I got facial recognition
running on every camera feed.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.377
Good news is I got
full facility control.

30:13.379 --> 30:16.079
MATTY: Good.
Keep us on lockdown.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.948
Zito's got to be here somewhere.
He didn't just disappear.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.121
(weakly):
Mask...

30:24.123 --> 30:27.858
Missing... mask.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.493
Mask...
MATTY: Take care of it.

30:31.062 --> 30:33.597
(indistinct chatter)

31:02.393 --> 31:03.460
Jack, they're stealing
the virus!

31:05.898 --> 31:09.199
The one that got you shot
and almost took out San Fran?

31:09.201 --> 31:11.368
They're stealing it back.

31:22.914 --> 31:24.014
(alarm bell ringing)

31:24.016 --> 31:25.315
(gasping)

31:25.317 --> 31:27.284
Bozer?

31:27.286 --> 31:29.253
Bozer!

31:43.534 --> 31:45.302
(keypad beeps)

31:49.207 --> 31:50.274
Here we go again.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.614
Bozer, what are you doing?
(alarm bell ringing)

31:57.616 --> 31:59.016
BOZER (weakly):
Zito...

32:05.023 --> 32:07.190
(screaming)
Everybody get down!

32:08.960 --> 32:10.294
(grunting)

32:24.442 --> 32:26.109
(gunshots)

32:28.680 --> 32:30.614
(tank hissing)

32:35.320 --> 32:36.653
OPERATIVE:
Let's go.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.722
(tank hissing)

32:41.326 --> 32:43.226
Riley, seal that door!

32:43.228 --> 32:44.361
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on it.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.502
(woman whimpering)

32:54.005 --> 32:55.205
I will kill her.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.507
(woman whimpers)

32:59.277 --> 33:03.046
(groaning)

33:12.090 --> 33:13.357
Put the virus down,

33:13.359 --> 33:16.093
or I cut this,

33:16.095 --> 33:19.329
and the coolant hits the O2.

33:20.765 --> 33:22.666
I'll save you the stoichiometry,
but, basically,

33:22.668 --> 33:24.434
the whole room's
gonna go up in flames.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.569
Okay?

33:25.571 --> 33:27.270
Now, we have two options.

33:27.272 --> 33:31.274
One-- you leave, two...

33:31.276 --> 33:34.444
MacGYVER: <i>Yeah, I know</i>
<i>what you're thinking.</i>

33:34.446 --> 33:37.614
<i>If that bluff didn't work in</i>
<i>Cairo, why's it gonna work now?</i>

33:37.616 --> 33:40.083
<i>Truth is...</i>
<i>I'm out of options.</i>

33:40.085 --> 33:44.187
<i>And you know what they say--</i>
<i>second time's a charm.</i>

33:44.189 --> 33:46.390
<i>Or is that the third?</i>

33:48.292 --> 33:49.793
I take it

33:49.795 --> 33:52.229
Murdoc's lessons
didn't include logic.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.398
You kill her, you die.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.101
You've suffered heavy losses
already, Director Webber.

33:59.137 --> 34:00.437
I doubt if you'll...

34:00.439 --> 34:02.172
(Zito shouts, woman screams)

34:06.411 --> 34:07.778
You were saying?

34:07.780 --> 34:09.713
(sighs)

34:12.050 --> 34:13.350
You're bluffing.

34:13.352 --> 34:16.553
if I'm bluffing right now,
but I do know that

34:16.555 --> 34:18.455
I'm not letting you leave
this room with that virus.

34:21.793 --> 34:25.829
So it really is Cairo
all over again.

34:29.801 --> 34:33.403
(whooshing, explosion)

34:36.574 --> 34:39.309
(groaning)

34:48.653 --> 34:51.254
(grunts)

34:51.256 --> 34:52.756
(explosion)
JACK: Come on!

34:52.758 --> 34:54.558
Get down!

34:56.394 --> 34:58.528
(groaning)

34:58.530 --> 35:01.465
Damn, Mac, what was the plan
if you couldn't break the glass?

35:01.467 --> 35:02.833
Plan? What plan?

35:02.835 --> 35:05.502
(laughs) Figures.
Come on.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.603
MATTY:
...communications restored

35:06.605 --> 35:07.871
and I want agents
sweeping the building.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.473
I want techs
sweeping our network.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.807
I need a full inventory.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.643
If something was lost,
stolen, damaged,

35:13.645 --> 35:16.413
or even slightly disrespected,
I need to know about it.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.615
This building is a crime scene.
Everything is evidence.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.586
How you feeling, bud?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.688
Sliced and diced.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.257
And bummed I had to
destroy my best mask.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.358
Hey.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.759
Hey, we agreed--
no more talking.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.496
All right? EMTs are
waiting outside.

35:32.498 --> 35:33.897
Whoa.

35:35.399 --> 35:37.501
Are you okay?

35:37.503 --> 35:40.470
Yeah, that's not mine.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.509
Hey, guys.

35:45.511 --> 35:49.546
Oh, um, sorry I blew up
half the building.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.448
Eh, I've always been more

35:51.450 --> 35:53.717
of a building-half-standing
kind of gal.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.887
I'm really proud
of the two of you.

35:56.889 --> 35:59.389
You saved a lot of lives today.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.458
Always knew
you were a big softie.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.461
Hit me with
a squeeze.
No hugs, Dalton, okay?

36:04.463 --> 36:06.596
Go get yourself
checked out by medical,

36:06.598 --> 36:08.298
and then get your butts
back up here.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.733
Oh, and bring a mop.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.902
(scoffs)

36:11.904 --> 36:13.803
Don't look at me.
Dude...

36:13.805 --> 36:15.338
(sighs)

36:15.340 --> 36:16.640
What? Come on!

36:33.658 --> 36:37.494
MacGYVER:
<i>Yeah, I know</i>
<i>what you're thinking.</i>

36:37.496 --> 36:39.462
<i>This is insane.</i>

36:39.464 --> 36:41.598
<i>But I should have done this</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

36:41.600 --> 36:44.301
<i>That prehistoric virus</i>
<i>I stole eight months ago</i>

36:44.303 --> 36:46.503
<i>in Lake Como doesn't belong</i>
<i>to the Phoenix Foundation,</i>

36:46.505 --> 36:48.572
<i>or to anyone, for that matter.</i>

36:48.574 --> 36:52.876
<i>It belongs to history,</i>
<i>and I'm going to send it back.</i>

37:05.356 --> 37:07.457
WOMAN (over P.A. system):
Dr. Ramirez to the ICU.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.459
Dr. Ramirez to the ICU.
(sniffs)

37:09.461 --> 37:11.528
(quiet rhythmic beeping)

37:16.300 --> 37:19.536
Hey.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.605
How you feeling?

37:21.607 --> 37:25.642
Like I never want to move again.

37:25.644 --> 37:28.545
You been here long?

37:28.547 --> 37:30.547
Few days.

37:30.549 --> 37:34.618
Jack came by yesterday,
brought this.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.652
(laughs)

37:35.654 --> 37:38.321
Oh, and you
just missed Mac.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.956
He brought flowers.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.525
Never was much
of a green thumb, but

37:42.527 --> 37:44.327
damn if he can't teach
Martha Stewart

37:44.329 --> 37:46.663
a thing or two about duct tape.

37:46.665 --> 37:50.700
You look way better.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.702
Doctors were

37:52.704 --> 37:55.639
impressed you survived
after so much blood loss.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.540
Yeah, I've always been
a great bleeder.

37:57.542 --> 38:00.677
Besides...

38:00.679 --> 38:04.681
I had a lot of reasons
to stick around.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.683
For my family,

38:06.685 --> 38:09.753
my friends.

38:15.660 --> 38:19.529
So much has happened
in these last eight months.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.733
You ever wish you could go back

38:23.735 --> 38:26.336
to before you knew?

38:26.338 --> 38:28.672
Nah.

38:28.674 --> 38:33.410
Ignorance is safer...

38:33.412 --> 38:35.679
but it isn't bliss.

38:37.481 --> 38:38.748
I wouldn't change
what's happened

38:38.750 --> 38:41.351
for anything in the world.

38:47.558 --> 38:48.792
(groans)

38:58.736 --> 39:01.638
So... your fake Zito's in jail.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.406
His partner's in the ground.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.842
I've got a dozen Organization
operatives to interrogate,

39:05.844 --> 39:08.044
and my team is still alive.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.780
Guess your plan was kind of
an epic fail, huh?

39:10.782 --> 39:14.684
I keep this tally in my head

39:14.686 --> 39:17.654
of all the people
I plan to kill.

39:17.656 --> 39:20.924
And the deaths get
more gruesome and elaborate

39:20.926 --> 39:24.127
the higher
you climb the list.

39:24.129 --> 39:29.699
And you, Matilda Webber,
have just made... the top.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.569
(Matty laughs)

39:32.571 --> 39:33.870
Oh, Murdoc.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.040
I'm gonna miss
our little chats.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.810
It's such a shame that I can't
do anything more to punish you,

39:40.812 --> 39:44.647
but you're already
in prison for life.

39:44.649 --> 39:46.816
Oh.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.552
I guess I could

39:49.554 --> 39:51.688
take away the last vestige
of the outside world

39:51.690 --> 39:53.723
that you have
in your possession--

39:53.725 --> 39:56.426
your one and only
personal item--

39:56.428 --> 39:59.129
this copy of
<i>Paradise Lost.</i>

39:59.131 --> 40:01.865
Effective
immediately, Murdoc,

40:01.867 --> 40:04.167
all of your privileges
have been revoked.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.771
Enjoy the rest of your life.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.839
You're looking at it.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.581
(engine revving)

40:18.583 --> 40:20.617
(horn honks)

40:20.619 --> 40:22.752
(laughs)

40:22.754 --> 40:24.421
(tires squeak)
Yes, yes!

40:24.423 --> 40:26.423
What up, braniac?

40:26.425 --> 40:28.758
What up?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.593
Bozer was right.
Huh?

40:30.595 --> 40:31.761
Sparky's gunning
for my job.

40:31.763 --> 40:32.929
(whirring)

40:32.931 --> 40:35.665
Uh, no, man.
Nobody wants your job.

40:35.667 --> 40:39.869
I'm just robot-sitting for Bozer
while he's on the mend.
Yeah.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.205
We just got back.
Where you off to now?

40:43.607 --> 40:47.544
Yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna go find my dad.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.714
Sounds good,
I got nothing going on anyway.

40:51.716 --> 40:54.684
Not taking no for an answer,
I'll drive.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.186
Get in the backseat, Tin Man.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.855
You are aware I cannot yet walk.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.223
You can take shotgun.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.891
You sure you want to take him?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.626
Well, Sparky deserves
a good road trip.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.695
I mean, he did
save Bozer's life,

41:05.697 --> 41:07.831
with that annoying
call for help.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.867
and Robocop's pretty
good at poker.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.802
For when we want to hit Vegas.
(clicks tongue)

41:12.804 --> 41:14.471
Vegas is not on the way.

41:14.473 --> 41:16.072
Vegas is always
on the way, dude.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.908
(sighs)

41:18.910 --> 41:21.044
What kind of road trip
doesn't involve Vegas?

41:21.046 --> 41:22.145
You might want to consider

41:22.147 --> 41:23.847
fastening your seatbelt,
MacGyver.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.548
Safety belts reduce the risk

41:25.550 --> 41:28.151
of fatal injury
to rear occupants by 45%.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.886
There is an on/off switch
on this thing, right?

41:29.888 --> 41:33.523
Viva Las Vegas.
Here we come.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.077
Murdoc, get up.

41:54.079 --> 41:56.079
I said, get up.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.650
I need medical
in the isolation wing.

42:00.652 --> 42:03.019
It's Murdoc. Open up.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.869
Shh.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.639
