05:49.391 --> 05:50.934

Hey!

06:56.750 --> 06:58.376
Dean Burch.

06:59.794 --> 07:03.131
You've had quite a colorful
career as a student, Mr. McGraw.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.885
You've managed to be suspended,
expelled, or physically thrown out of

07:06.968 --> 07:09.721
16 colleges and universities
throughout the country.

07:10.805 --> 07:14.142
You've changed your major 23 times.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.978
And your presence has been tied directly

07:17.062 --> 07:20.315
to three university presidents
losing their jobs,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.401
two others being
committed to sanitariums,

07:23.485 --> 07:25.904
and at least one known suicide.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.782
Have I left anything out?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.914
Just the good stuff.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.623
Mr. McGraw, as you are aware,

07:36.706 --> 07:39.918
this university, our university

07:40.001 --> 07:44.172
has the reputation as the single worst
educational institution in the country.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.049
That's because it is the worst

07:46.132 --> 07:48.565
educational institution
in the country, sir.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.263
Do you realize
that not one single student,

07:52.347 --> 07:55.238
including you, and them,

07:55.934 --> 07:58.913
has ever won any award
for anything?

07:59.270 --> 08:02.190
Not one ribbon, not one trophy.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.651
In fact,
the only certifiable recognition

08:04.734 --> 08:07.237
that any of our alumni
have ever received

08:07.320 --> 08:08.949
is a parole.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.246
Mr. McGraw,
every year for the past 15 years

08:16.329 --> 08:18.373
the colleges and
universities of this country

08:18.456 --> 08:21.709
have held an
intercollegiate raft race.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.423
If just once we...

08:27.048 --> 08:28.842
I mean you

08:28.925 --> 08:31.761
could win this race for our school,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.679
it would mean an end

08:33.763 --> 08:36.270
to jokes like "Lobotomy U."

08:41.770 --> 08:45.195
it would mean that
for the first time in our history...

08:45.316 --> 08:49.694
Let me clarify my position,
so that you can understand.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.490
A raft means a river,

08:52.574 --> 08:55.493
and a river means rapids,

08:55.577 --> 08:58.553
and rapids spells death.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.376
You got the wrong guy!

09:00.540 --> 09:02.632
Not so fast, McGraw!

09:03.126 --> 09:04.335
Okay.

09:04.419 --> 09:08.140
You've got the wrong guy.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.216
Excuse me, Dean Burch.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.261
Um, I think there's another point
that should be made.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.971
I don't need this aggravation,

09:15.054 --> 09:17.098
and this really
doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.850
I'm damned if I'll let my university

09:18.933 --> 09:21.352
be the laughing stock
of this country any longer!

09:21.436 --> 09:24.569
I want a victory with a capital "V"
and I want it now!

09:24.606 --> 09:27.234
No more excuses!
No more holding back!

09:27.484 --> 09:30.242
That's why I picked you.
And them!

09:30.779 --> 09:32.113
You have the distinct honor of being

09:32.197 --> 09:34.945
the four worst students
in the entire country.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.577
You are not
at the bottom of the list,

09:37.744 --> 09:39.967
you are the bottom of the list!

09:40.330 --> 09:43.583
That's why you're going to
win this race for me and Lepetomane.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.634
You're the only men
who virtually have nothing left to lose!

09:47.045 --> 09:48.777
Except my temper.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.799
Mr. McGraw,

09:51.466 --> 09:53.641
I'm not asking you
to do this for nothing.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.514
In fact, I'm prepared to
make a very generous offer.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.100
Degrees.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.519
For all of you.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.063
Degrees?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.273
In whatever subject you like.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.150
English lit?

10:09.234 --> 10:10.860
If that's what you want.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.363
Providing, of course, that you win.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.781
Physics?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.666
Biochemistry.
With a minor in art history.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.391
Home Ec?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.544
And what if I say no?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.381
I was hoping
we could avoid this scene,

10:32.006 --> 10:34.514
but since you feel
the need to test me...

10:34.759 --> 10:36.928
I suppose you know nothing
about the student loans

10:37.011 --> 10:40.356
you've taken out
in 35 different names.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.332
Or last semester's bookmaking
operation in the computer center.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.730
You think you can blackmail me

10:47.814 --> 10:50.984
into playing this
little game of yours, don't you?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.529
Well, I got news for you, Mister.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.989
This ain't just any dumb schmo
you're dealing with here,

10:57.198 --> 11:01.579
this is Bob McGraw.
The Bob McGraw.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.008
And it's gonna take men
a lot bigger than you

11:05.373 --> 11:08.055
to make this guy play ball.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.723
How about Poli-Sci?

11:25.643 --> 11:26.686
I don't believe it!

11:26.811 --> 11:28.938
Bob, listen to this.
She dumped me!

11:29.022 --> 11:30.565
Aw, come on, Max.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.151
Bob, she said she never
wants to see me again.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.778
Let me tell you something about women.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.531
They always say
the opposite of what they mean.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.366
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.619
"If you come within
a three block radius of my house,

"I will have my new boyfriend Vito

11:45.079 --> 11:47.790
"rip off your head
and spit in your neck."

11:48.958 --> 11:50.627
You're right, kid.
You've been dumped.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.712
Forget about her.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.381
The bar is now open.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.218
- Banana daiquiri.
- Martini, straight up.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.012

and maybe not tomorrow,

12:18.237 --> 12:19.656

who will?

is starting to resemble the astrodome.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.887
Watch what a fool
I can make out of myself.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.231
Is that worth watching?

29:26.431 --> 29:27.766
I'm very good at it,

of such an attractive woman.
