WEBVTT

00:05.423 --> 00:08.384
- Could I help you with something?
- Do you know who I am?

00:09.301 --> 00:11.637
You canceled us.
So don't act like this matters to you.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.265
Nico, you don't not matter to me.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.642
Oh, I'm gonna be 30,
and I'm still so undercooked.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.269
It's gonna be your birthday.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.271
We should throw
a big birthday blowout for you.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.647
We can totally do it at the bar.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.733
Come on, babe, this is already
hard enough for me as it is.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.986
Juniper, you broke up with me
two days after I buried my mother.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.530
I'm sorry, baby... I mean, Lyn.

00:29.572 --> 00:30.740
¿Le entiende español?

00:30.781 --> 00:33.033
She was just born here,
so she doesn't speak it that well.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.952
I blame your parents.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.580
We need to do something right now!

00:37.621 --> 00:39.331
- We need to vote.
- Vote? What...

00:39.373 --> 00:41.917
Are we voting on a particular action here?
Are we voting to keep discussing action?

00:41.959 --> 00:43.419
Oh, my God!

01:25.085 --> 01:27.254
- You like that?
- Yeah.

01:28.631 --> 01:29.632
How about this?

01:29.673 --> 01:30.883
Yeah.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.011
Don't do that.

01:34.053 --> 01:35.054
What are you doing?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.556
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.308
I'm sorry. Are my nails too...

01:39.350 --> 01:41.894
Don't do that.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.147
Okay.

01:48.526 --> 01:52.238
I'm confused, though,

01:52.279 --> 01:54.365
because, well...

01:55.991 --> 01:58.035
That's different.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.954
You're not looking right at me.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.624
Rudy...

02:03.666 --> 02:05.459
Don't make this into a thing, Lyn.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.733
Señora, señora,
did they show you a warrant?

02:29.775 --> 02:31.026
- Le enseñaron paperwork?
- No, no.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.444
They just came, and look at that.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.280
They broke his window,
and they yanked him out.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.031
What are we gonna do about it, mi gente?

02:36.073 --> 02:37.533
You can't sit this one out.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.201
This is happening on your watch.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.413
They just dragged one of us out
Gestapo-style, illegally,

02:42.454 --> 02:45.165
so they could put him,
and this is not fucking politics,

02:45.207 --> 02:46.208
this is facts.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.836
So that they can put him
in a private detention

02:48.878 --> 02:51.797
where he'll make money
for the same fucking assholes

02:51.839 --> 02:53.090
that owned the businesses

02:53.132 --> 02:54.884
that he fucking worked for
in the first place.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.179
No due fucking process,
'cause this is America,

02:59.221 --> 03:02.558
where it's okay to cage
fucking brown people like beasts.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.934
Are you okay with that?

03:35.174 --> 03:37.509
Do you have all your donations
for the event tonight?

03:38.552 --> 03:42.222
- I want to support.
- It's not really an event.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.266
It's just a birthday party.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.186
Anything with a theme is an event.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.897
Adult quinceañera is
a clever idea for a birthday.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.944
It's a double queer-ceañera.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.072
Marcos is turning 30, so double.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.532
Queer-ceañera.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.785
You're so witty.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.624
Yeah, Marcos wanted to do it
throwback-style

04:08.666 --> 04:11.377
with a '80s telenovela swing

04:11.418 --> 04:14.546
and the soldier thingies on the shoulders,

04:14.588 --> 04:16.882
but, you know, queer.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.218
So I'm gonna be his chambelana.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.638
Do you know how many times
I've had to be a chambelán?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.473
I still remember how to dance el vals.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.891
I bet.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.185
Do you still need centerpieces?

04:28.227 --> 04:29.895
Yeah, actually.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.522
Centerpieces would be nice.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.357
Well, then take me up
on borrowing them from my mother.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.442
Only if you come with me.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.111
You know I can't today.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.363
But I'm telling you,
get anything you need from her.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.656
She's thrown a million parties

04:40.698 --> 04:44.118
and has an entire room
with things like centerpieces.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.078
I'm a little bit scared of her.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.957
You know, but maybe just don't mention
the whole queer-ceañera thing.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.751
Why, because it's queer?

04:53.585 --> 04:56.964
What? No, Lyn, she donates to GLAAD.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.632
It's just the whole...

05:00.342 --> 05:03.679
It's the vibe of the bar
that I think she wouldn't get.

05:03.721 --> 05:06.015
You know, it's just
the kind of programming that...

05:06.056 --> 05:07.933
Wait. Are we too janky for your mom?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.685
No, not janky.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.355
'Cause everything we do is on purpose.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.025
It's a curated dive bar, Rudy.

05:16.066 --> 05:20.237
- Everything has been...
- Look, go borrow the centerpieces, babe.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.824
A little quality time between
my two best girls will be good.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.801
We're not saying that Victor Villanueva

05:42.843 --> 05:45.387
doesn't have a claim
to your mother's estate.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.431
He definitely can make one.

05:48.849 --> 05:53.771
But given the documented history of abuse,
the police report, the photos,

05:53.812 --> 05:58.525
even this question of citizenship,
which is my expertise,

05:58.567 --> 06:01.695
you and your sister are
in a pretty strong position,

06:01.737 --> 06:04.573
especially right now
when the trend is to be

06:04.615 --> 06:07.993
less forgiving when it comes to crimes
by undocumented people.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.456
This would not look good for him in court.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.714
Thank you.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.262
Oh. Okay.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.306
Gracias.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.372
Mi amorcita, ay.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.748
Discúlpame.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.128
¿No te han ofrecido nada? ¡Estela!

06:59.169 --> 07:01.713
¿Quieres alguna limonada? ¿Quieres un té?

07:04.508 --> 07:06.718
- No.
- Sorry. Would you like some tea?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.346
No, thank you. I'm good.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.889
- Let's have a lemonade.
- Okay.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.057
Estela!

07:12.099 --> 07:14.643
Tráenos unas limonadas.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.229
So tell me about this party.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.313
Well...

07:18.355 --> 07:20.691
We used to throw
the most elaborate affairs

07:20.732 --> 07:22.401
when Rodolfito was a baby.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.029
Teníamos un evento de Día de Muertos
que ni te imaginas.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.447
Oh, wow.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.366
Oh, I love a good party.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.785
So tell me about yours.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.121
It's really...

07:34.163 --> 07:36.748
It's just a little birthday thing.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.791
Dinner party?

07:39.376 --> 07:40.377
No.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.338
It's a little bigger than that,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.674
like, 90, 100 people.

07:45.716 --> 07:46.758
- Thank you. Gracias.
- Oh.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.969
- That's a proper party.
- Yeah.

07:49.011 --> 07:52.181
Estela, trae las cosas que escogí,
por favor.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.183
And this is at your bar?

07:54.766 --> 07:57.686
Our lounge, yes, that we own.

07:58.312 --> 08:02.024
We've actually been getting
a lot of buzz lately.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.693
We were featured in Litch Magazine.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.069
I don't know if you...

08:08.113 --> 08:09.865
I'd love to see it sometime.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.784
I would love that.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.162
I think it's good for a woman

08:15.204 --> 08:17.623
to entertain herself with work
before marriage.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.333
I really believe that.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.337
Gracias, Estela.

08:24.755 --> 08:28.383
I took the liberty of putting together
a set of centerpieces,

08:28.425 --> 08:30.761
porque Rudy me dijo que
eso era lo que necesitabas.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.803
- ¿Verdad?
- Oh, sí.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.723
But I also want to lend you

08:34.765 --> 08:37.100
this exquisite piece.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.769
This punch bowl is an heirloom.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.730
It's been in our family
from Porfirio Díaz times.

08:41.772 --> 08:45.651
Wow. It's so gorgeous.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.778
I couldn't, though.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.203
It's just that this party

08:56.245 --> 08:59.998
isn't very punch bowl-y.

09:03.794 --> 09:04.795
But okay.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.050
Do you know who Porfirio Díaz was?

09:10.717 --> 09:11.802
Of course.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.637
Just a...

09:14.638 --> 09:15.806
...great...

09:18.183 --> 09:20.060
Mexican hero.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.565
If dictators are your idea of heroes.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.317
No, no.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.861
Some unsolicited advice...

09:29.903 --> 09:32.281
admit when you don't know something.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.659
Empty vessels make the most noise.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.894
Where's Lyn?

10:03.603 --> 10:04.604
Good question.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.149
Marcos is queen bee in charge, though.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.191
You'll see.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.531
- You need something?
- No.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.117
I should help. What can I...?

10:18.452 --> 10:21.079
Well, we have an entanglement situation.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.301
Sorry.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.719
It was a rough night.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.389
My back's blown out.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.727
Where are you sleeping these days?

10:45.562 --> 10:47.022
Back at Matty's.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.441
You mean back at Zoe's.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.651
No, just back at Matty's.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.323
Even after she physically assaulted you,
you're back there.

10:56.365 --> 10:57.616
- No one got assaulted.
- Why do women do that?

10:57.657 --> 10:58.867
I don't fucking get it!

10:58.909 --> 11:01.787
I'm sorry, but you kind of gave up
your right to get like this with me.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.915
I'm just noticing
inconsistencies in character.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.500
You claim to be this well-adjusted person.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.169
When I have claimed to be well-adjusted?

11:14.841 --> 11:15.967
You know what? You're right.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.970
I have no right to get like this.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.264
I'm out of line.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.768
¿Dónde chingados is Lyn?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.062
This has crossed from Latino time
to rude-ass-bitch time.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.147
I'll text her.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.315
She's not answering.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.359
Well, then with your permission,
Miss Emma,

11:32.401 --> 11:33.902
I'm making an executive decision.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.988
For anyone who isn't on my guest list,
20 bucks get you in.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.950
I'll put a queer right there
with a cashbox.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.410
I'll keep texting her.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.037
A ver, niñas, ayúdenme.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.539
Why does he have to be so bossy?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.165
Ay, cálmate.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.836
I just, like, literally
can't do anything right.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.921
Nothing is good enough for that woman.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.631
Mastica, mi'ja. Don't forget to chew.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.974
How did I forget
that bologna's kind of great?

12:06.643 --> 12:08.228
I'm sorry, Miss Piggy.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.068
How do I get her to like me?

12:16.278 --> 12:17.904
How do you know she doesn't?

12:17.946 --> 12:21.366
Papi, women, we know these things.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.743
And that woman hates me.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.708
And now I can't do anything
right with Rudy either.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.460
Are you two fighting?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.086
Sort of.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.755
I don't know.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.676
This morning I...

12:41.470 --> 12:43.680
...offended him by mistake.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.683
Nothing I do is good enough.

12:47.642 --> 12:52.481
Mi'ja, in God's eyes,
you already are good enough.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.234
You're perfect justo como tú eres.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.696
Don't worry. Things are gonna work out.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.073
They never have before.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.118
You don't know this
because you don't know me yet,

13:05.160 --> 13:09.039
but I don't exactly have
the best track record

13:09.080 --> 13:10.916
when it comes to relationships.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.167
I do know you, mi'ja.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.377
And shoot, join the club.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.630
Do you think your papi
has a spotless record?

13:17.756 --> 13:21.843
Mi'ja, bad decisions run in the family.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.512
Oh, no!

13:24.554 --> 13:25.555
¿Qué crees?

13:27.057 --> 13:30.519
"She is clothed in strength and dignity,

13:30.560 --> 13:34.105
and she laughs
without fear of the future."

13:34.147 --> 13:36.608
Proverbs 31:25.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.739
Don't let your past define you, mujercita.

13:42.781 --> 13:47.452
You're being tested,
but that's the beauty of a life in Christ.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.829
Once you accept Him
as your Lord and Savior,

13:49.871 --> 13:51.831
then you make the decision,

13:51.873 --> 13:56.086
the very purposeful decision
to be made new

13:56.127 --> 13:57.671
and wash it all away.

13:58.838 --> 14:03.051
To walk the righteous path,
to pass that test.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.678
And guess what happens then.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.888
What?

14:06.930 --> 14:08.557
Then you have nothing to fear.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.684
Huh?

14:10.725 --> 14:12.978
"Clothed in strength and dignity,

14:13.019 --> 14:15.897
she laughs without fear of the future."

14:16.940 --> 14:20.360
Steady in your path, Lyn, fearless, huh?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.207
You specifically said not to.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.209
I know she didn't show it to that puta,

14:36.251 --> 14:38.837
but we sent out that mandante,
and she still did it.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.381
Look, in a way, it's not bad
to start putting that out there.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.008
That kind of awareness...

14:43.049 --> 14:45.677
I mean, we're all in agreement
that it's a fucked-up situation.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.180
Fuck.

14:57.856 --> 14:58.857
Hey.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.944
- That video...
- Shaun King reposted it.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.154
I know.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.115
But also, we held a vote, Mari.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.491
Really?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.118
You're gonna talk to me
about a pinche vote

15:10.160 --> 15:11.828
when we're under attack as a people?

15:11.870 --> 15:14.956
This is a collective.
You can't go toda rogue like that.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.626
I didn't go rogue.
I posted as La Pinche Chinche.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.253
No, you posted that shit
from all Vigilante accounts.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.588
You were repping us.

15:21.630 --> 15:22.756
And it worked.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.967
Did you see how many hits we got
and hella follows?

15:26.009 --> 15:27.677
This is why we got to act now.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.971
We all agreed on a different strategy.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.848
Fucking strategy.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.808
It's puro pinche talk.

15:33.850 --> 15:37.020
That's all we do around here, talk shit

15:37.062 --> 15:39.356
and stand in front of a fucking bar
that's never even really...

15:39.397 --> 15:40.649
Never even what?

15:45.612 --> 15:49.407
Yoli, you've been my friend
for how long now?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.536
But even more than that,
we've been homies in the struggle.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.248
But something, it's...

15:58.458 --> 16:02.045
it's just not the same with us,
with what we're doing.

16:03.421 --> 16:06.675
There's real shit out there,
and it's like...

16:07.676 --> 16:09.844
...our glasses got all fuzzy,

16:09.886 --> 16:12.472
and we can't even see
what's right in front of us.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.059
And I can't pretend not to see anymore.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.064
Amiga...

16:22.440 --> 16:24.025
...I think I'm done.

16:25.819 --> 16:26.903
You're not done, Mari.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.863
No, I am.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.325
And I hope that you and me...

16:32.367 --> 16:33.785
I mean, like, I don't want this...

16:33.827 --> 16:36.496
Mari, cállate.
You knew you were going to get called out.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.081
- Don't get toda...
- Yoli.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.875
Mira, I get that you've been
going through a lot lately

16:40.917 --> 16:42.293
with your apá passing, and I'm sorry...

16:42.335 --> 16:43.795
No, Yoli.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.714
This isn't about my apá.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.674
I'm done.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.300
Mari.

16:51.720 --> 16:52.721
Mari.

16:57.559 --> 16:58.560
Mari!

17:02.897 --> 17:04.149
Have a good one.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.162
Not today, Satanás.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.455
- Hey, let me help you.
- No.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.544
Juniper, what the hell happened
to your face?

17:24.586 --> 17:26.504
It's tribal.
It's supposed to mean "growth."

17:26.546 --> 17:28.715
But it turns out it doesn't mean anything.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.925
Why would you tattoo your fucking face?

17:30.967 --> 17:33.094
I know. It's getting removed.

17:33.136 --> 17:37.223
Look, Lyn,
there's so much that I want to tell you.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.308
Like what?

17:38.349 --> 17:39.934
Well, like, when we broke up,

17:39.976 --> 17:42.687
I went through
this whole existential thing.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.731
Oh, I saw your existential thing...

17:44.773 --> 17:46.357
blonde and 5'11".

17:48.568 --> 17:50.278
What are you even doing here, Juniper?

17:50.320 --> 17:52.572
Well, it's like I said
in all my texts, babe.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.407
I need you back.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.117
I made so many mistakes,

17:56.159 --> 17:58.244
and the biggest one was how we left it.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.537
Yeah, you broke up with me,

17:59.579 --> 18:02.165
like, a day after my mom died,
you asshole.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.251
I know. Hey, hey, I know.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.962
I know, and that was
one of my biggest mistakes.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.802
Look, I was in Joshua Tree,
tripping on frog venom...

18:14.552 --> 18:16.054
...and I realized you're the one.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.431
Juniper, you know what?

18:18.473 --> 18:21.726
I have no time for Coachella bros
with a savior complex.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.186
Thank you, next.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.188
Do not follow me.

18:25.230 --> 18:28.817
Oh, and I wouldn't walk around here
with that thing on your face.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.652
I won't be responsible
for you getting jumped

18:30.693 --> 18:33.988
because you're an appropriating gringo.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.657
Good-bye, Juniper.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.622
I don't know. I think that it's just gonna
be so much fun.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.249
Yeah, you should wear that.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.917
No, I can't.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.877
- Why?
- I was trying to eat my food.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.840
- Ay, por fin llegas.
- Hey.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.174
Where were you?

18:53.216 --> 18:55.051
Curly brought your outfit.
You want to see it?

18:55.885 --> 18:56.886
I do.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.181
- Hey, Marcos.
- Huh?

19:00.223 --> 19:04.686
When you said you wanted
to wrap the place in tulle, I didn't...

19:04.727 --> 19:05.728
Isn't it dreamy?

19:05.770 --> 19:07.272
And wait, we're not even done.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.483
What else are you gonna throw on this?

19:10.525 --> 19:12.735
Curly, show her.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.487
These are the centerpieces.

19:14.529 --> 19:15.780
- Do you love it?
- You love it, right?

19:18.741 --> 19:20.159
She loves it.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.704
I just got centerpieces.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.039
Okay.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.752
- Has Emma seen any of this?
- Sort of.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.045
She was looking for you earlier.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.214
Okay, I better go explain.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.427
Oh, I'll see you inside so we
can set up the hookah lounge.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.846
- The what?
- The hookah lounge. We talked about it.

19:40.889 --> 19:41.890
Okay.

19:50.148 --> 19:54.110
Hey, so what are your thoughts
about what's going on out there?

19:54.152 --> 19:57.614
Like, edge of tacky but cute
or full-on trashy?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.741
I just wanted Marcos to have
the birthday of his dreams,

19:59.782 --> 20:01.993
but maybe I should have supervised
more closely.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.078
Oh, everything is donated.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.497
So we must have spent, like,
a total of 50 bucks.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.916
No harm done there.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.045
By the way, do you know
who "Profiterole" Díaz is?

20:12.086 --> 20:14.380
I know who Porfirio Díaz is,

20:14.422 --> 20:16.382
who ruled Mexico for 30 years.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.009
That dude.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.471
Well, this was basically
his personal punch bowl,

20:21.512 --> 20:24.849
or at least that's what
Rudy's mom wants me to believe.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.809
Why would she even lend it to me?

20:26.851 --> 20:29.020
- Just to fuck with me.
- I don't know.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.564
I guess I'll put it
in the "make your own recuerdos" table

20:31.606 --> 20:33.024
and out of harm's way.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.776
Lyn, I was hoping we could talk.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.779
I know, I know, indoor hookah, gross.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.323
I'm going to tell Marcos
that we can't do it

20:40.365 --> 20:42.784
because the bar's actually
gonna be open to the public.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.745
But I think what he really wants is
just pillows everywhere.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.331
So I'm gonna do a hookah-less
hookah lounge on the stage.

20:48.373 --> 20:52.251
I saw a lawyer today about Victor.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.797
God, you are so paranoid.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.757
It's just a precaution,

20:57.799 --> 21:00.093
a backup plan in case
he comes after the building

21:00.134 --> 21:01.344
now that the deed is in our name.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.512
He's not.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.182
He's not going to come after anything.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.476
You don't know him. He wouldn't.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.646
No, I don't, but I'm gonna be
one step ahead in case he would.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.357
Look, let's not...

21:16.401 --> 21:18.569
The lawyer showed me something.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.030
She found a police report

21:21.072 --> 21:25.034
with photos of Vidalia when he would...

21:25.076 --> 21:26.077
Emma.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.871
- No. Emma.
- They're horrible.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.165
The fact that he's even capable
of something like this...

21:31.207 --> 21:32.333
I'm sorry.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.211
I'm sorry, but I don't want to see them.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.465
Emma.

21:40.883 --> 21:41.884
I love you.

21:42.802 --> 21:47.432
And I love that we actually
have a relationship, like, so much.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.476
Lyn, he hit her, bad.

21:50.518 --> 21:51.978
And I'm not denying that.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.605
Neither would he.

21:55.606 --> 21:58.276
Papi's actually been very honest with me
about his past.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.404
I don't doubt what's in those pictures.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.241
But that was him then.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.827
He's a different man now.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.455
He's been delivered.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.999
Oh, you talk Christian now?

22:13.041 --> 22:17.170
Emma, I'm so sorry
that you had to see her like that.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.379
I am.

22:19.922 --> 22:23.509
I bet those pictures are horrible,
just like you say.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.888
But I don't need to see them.

22:29.390 --> 22:33.936
I'm starting from scratch with him,
and I need you to let me.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.271
Please.

22:36.189 --> 22:40.443
This whole thing is a second chance for me
to set my life right.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.322
"Clothed in dignity,"

22:44.363 --> 22:46.866
I'm steady in my path.

22:46.908 --> 22:47.909
Fearless.

22:50.328 --> 22:54.290
I just want to be able to get to know him
without having those images in my head.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.544
I promise you, I won't push him on you.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.213
I won't bring him here.

23:01.881 --> 23:06.385
Just let me be steady in my path.

23:06.427 --> 23:07.720
Please, Emma.

23:10.181 --> 23:13.101
All right, Lyn. You be steady.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.229
Thank you.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.818
Thank you.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.695
I don't know why we didn't
do this yesterday.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.405
Mama, you got to try this on already.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.992
Y si no te queda, I have a friend
who can do alterations real quick.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.120
Chambelana fierceness, girl.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.707
What does this have to do
with chambelanes?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.210
It has the cositas on the shoulder
like chambelanes...

23:39.252 --> 23:41.170
Pero, you know, sexy.

23:43.798 --> 23:48.010
I'm actually trying to move away
from this level of sexy.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.929
Ay, pero why?

24:21.878 --> 24:25.131
You're my quince court.
You can't not slay.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.133
How are we not slaying for you?

24:27.175 --> 24:29.218
Ay, there's glitter everywhere.

24:29.260 --> 24:32.388
- Nico, vente. Vente.
- Oh, okay, okay.

24:32.430 --> 24:33.556
Okay.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.559
Chambelana, come on.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.438
A ver, manitas, manitas.

24:46.569 --> 24:50.198
I want this to be
an experience of connectivity,

24:50.239 --> 24:51.824
my found family...

24:51.866 --> 24:54.035
Oh, shit, Marcos, I forgot to tell you,

24:54.076 --> 24:57.413
we have a hard out at 11:00
because of noise ordinances.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.624
Everyone is gonna have to come inside
with the paying patrons.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.001
Don't worry, las jotas will comply.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.044
Okay.

25:03.085 --> 25:07.048
But first, I want to say thank you, Lyn,
for this beautiful party.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.425
Oh, baby, I love you. You're so welcome.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.845
I think people are waiting
for something to start.

25:13.638 --> 25:14.639
Prayer huddle.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.601
No. No, Emma, join us, please.

25:19.727 --> 25:20.853
Vente.

25:23.064 --> 25:27.026
I have to thank you, too,
for allowing this quince to happen.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.614
It's a rite of passage
that little Marquitos would only dream of.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.620
But tonight lo reclamo...

25:39.622 --> 25:40.831
...in communion.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.043
- Oh, wow.
- Where the fuck did that come from?

25:45.503 --> 25:47.672
En nombre de Oshun, de la Guadalupana,

25:47.713 --> 25:50.007
de Santa Selena, and Jenny from the Block.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.050
Amén.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.636
I'm on hostess duty tonight.

25:53.678 --> 25:54.929
So...

26:01.185 --> 26:02.853
Emma, what are you doing?

26:03.688 --> 26:05.398
No bar staff on drugs.

26:05.439 --> 26:07.525
I had no intention, by the way.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.987
Tonight I'm going
to "go steady in my path"

26:11.028 --> 26:13.948
and fearlessly partake
in not giving a shit.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.827
Damn, girl, get loose.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.078
That was a lot.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.122
- It's okay, I'm good.
- All right.

26:21.163 --> 26:24.083
Well, I hope you're ready
for some serious dehydration

26:24.125 --> 26:25.584
and an existential crisis.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.512
¡A perrear, perras, a perrear!

29:30.603 --> 29:31.645
Emma...

29:32.646 --> 29:33.898
I say this with love,

29:33.939 --> 29:37.651
but you, like everybody here,

29:37.693 --> 29:41.989
are very, very high,
and that's very, very annoying.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.284
- Okay.
- Announcement.

29:47.077 --> 29:51.957
I am decolonizing my name.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.711
I am decolonizing my gender.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.924
On this night, I become the spectrum.

30:01.091 --> 30:06.055
The prince of flowers, song, and dance.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.515
On this night...

30:08.516 --> 30:12.478
...you may call me Xochipilli.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.981
Fuck patriarchal colonialism!

30:16.023 --> 30:17.024
Yes!

30:17.900 --> 30:19.318
Thank you.

30:20.194 --> 30:24.156
It's 10:45,
and this party's already turning.

30:25.366 --> 30:27.409
We keep going the way of "ratchetness."

30:30.329 --> 30:31.914
I think I'm pregnant.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.918
Okay.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.799
Wait.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.470
Emma, like, for real, for real
or, like, mushrooms for real?

30:46.512 --> 30:49.306
Because I'm pretty sure
Nico can't get you pregnant.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.351
Like, for real, for real.

30:53.394 --> 30:54.562
Like...

30:57.940 --> 30:59.942
...Xochipilli for real.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.782
Is that even real after tonight, though?

31:08.826 --> 31:10.286
It's as real as this table...

31:12.246 --> 31:14.832
As real as these poppers.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.874
- These guys.
- Oh, my...

31:15.916 --> 31:17.918
- As real...
- Em!

31:19.169 --> 31:21.213
...as this punch bowl.

31:21.255 --> 31:22.756
Okay, Emma.

31:23.299 --> 31:26.260
It's time for you to drink some water
and go to bed, okay?

31:26.302 --> 31:29.763
I mean, what's happening inside me

31:29.805 --> 31:32.141
is just a collection of cells...

31:32.808 --> 31:35.853
...cells that can easily be not real.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.774
Like this hideous bowl

31:40.816 --> 31:43.569
holding all of these things

31:43.611 --> 31:46.780
- is so very real.
- Emma. Oh, my God.

31:46.822 --> 31:47.823
But...

31:49.325 --> 31:50.993
...in one second...

31:52.411 --> 31:54.204
...this hideous bowl...

31:55.247 --> 31:57.499
...is no longer real.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.213
"Profiterole" Díaz.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.761
- You did this on purpose.
- Oh, my God.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.012
You know what, Emma?

32:10.054 --> 32:12.931
If you're so mad about papi,
I wish you'd just have it out with me

32:12.973 --> 32:15.809
instead of throwing
this passive-aggressive tantrum.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.812
Do you have any idea
what's gonna happen to me

32:18.854 --> 32:22.650
when monster-in-law finds
what I did to her stupid punch bowl?

32:22.691 --> 32:24.652
- I'm so sorry. I'll put it together.
- No, Emma. Emma.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.363
Get the fuck away, Emma!

32:28.781 --> 32:33.619
If you want to make yourself useful,
go tell everyone to get the fuck inside

32:33.661 --> 32:35.496
while I deal with this.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.666
- You're really angry.
- Yes, I am.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.669
Now go.

32:42.753 --> 32:43.754
Okay.

32:44.797 --> 32:47.883
Everyone, could we...

32:49.843 --> 32:54.056
Everyone, could we
go inside the bar, please?

33:01.689 --> 33:02.940
No.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.817
Oh, don't be like that.

33:04.858 --> 33:08.237
Juniper, you don't want
to fuck with me right now.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.155
I kind of do.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.198
Are you...?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.703
You're high as fuck, aren't you?

33:16.203 --> 33:18.706
Somebody had some really nice...

33:18.747 --> 33:21.291
I don't know what it was, but I smoked it.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.671
It's an unexpected group
of folks you gathered here.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.047
Really nice, though.

33:27.089 --> 33:30.217
I had this great conversation
with someone about courtesy bottoms...

33:30.259 --> 33:32.553
You know what? I can't even look at you
with that thing on your face.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.139
I told you, it's getting removed.

33:35.723 --> 33:39.017
You know what's dope about being here?

33:39.059 --> 33:42.646
Is the whole time we were dating, I never
once got to meet any of your friends.

33:42.688 --> 33:47.276
It's so nice to see your vibe,
like, the "real you" vibe.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.737
This isn't the "real me" vibe.

33:50.654 --> 33:53.282
This is just what
my friend wanted for his party.

33:53.323 --> 33:57.244
Right, you threw him
this badass parking-lot party.

33:57.286 --> 34:00.205
You know what, Juniper?
I will not be judged by you.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.750
You have misspelled hieroglyphics
all over your face.

34:03.542 --> 34:07.045
Okay, look, all I'm saying is it's awesome

34:07.087 --> 34:10.716
to see you in your element,
you know, with colorful people,

34:10.758 --> 34:13.844
having an uninhibited,
loosey-goosey good time.

34:15.763 --> 34:16.764
This is not...

34:17.723 --> 34:18.724
I'm not...

34:21.769 --> 34:26.231
...uninhibited or loose.

34:29.193 --> 34:30.194
I'm not.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.366
Are you processing?

34:37.284 --> 34:39.536
We always liked to make love
when we were processing.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.710
I miss you, babe.

34:48.921 --> 34:52.007
Can we just do, like, a rewind and go back

34:52.049 --> 34:54.593
to where we left off,
like, everything like it was?

34:55.177 --> 34:58.889
We can do your goddess lotion thing,

34:58.931 --> 35:00.307
the jewelry store.

35:00.349 --> 35:01.975
I'll give you the credit cards back.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.812
I just want to make
whatever you want happen.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.815
When you broke up with me...

35:09.691 --> 35:12.110
...I was like...

35:14.154 --> 35:15.405
..."Shit."

35:17.199 --> 35:18.408
What am I gonna do?"

35:20.786 --> 35:23.205
But then I snapped the fuck out of it.

35:24.957 --> 35:28.210
And I got right with myself...

35:29.419 --> 35:31.046
...and with my family.

35:33.006 --> 35:37.219
I found a boyfriend
who makes me want to be an actual adult.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.685
And I got serious about this place,
about our bar.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.061
Yeah, I know, babe.

35:46.103 --> 35:49.147
I love seeing your whole thing.

35:50.357 --> 35:54.194
Juniper, I'm building something here,

35:54.236 --> 35:55.863
something important.

35:58.782 --> 36:03.120
And you showing up here like this...

36:05.372 --> 36:06.874
You know what it was?

36:10.544 --> 36:12.254
It was a test.

36:15.591 --> 36:17.676
A test that I just passed.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.888
And you want to know why?

36:23.307 --> 36:25.225
Because I am clothed

36:25.267 --> 36:28.478
in strength and dignity, motherfucker.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.856
And I'm steady as fuck.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.276
I'm gonna go get a broom.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.613
And you should be gone
by the time I come back.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.448
Labia Major.

38:15.419 --> 38:16.712
That's Kermit's Collar.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.923
Yeah, look, right there.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.801
I don't know if NASA recognizes that one.

38:28.265 --> 38:31.601
We used to make our own constellations.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.104
Me and Lyn.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.607
We'd just come up here and just...

38:41.653 --> 38:43.238
She was so good at it.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.323
Just...

38:46.199 --> 38:47.826
She's so mad at me.

39:34.081 --> 39:35.082
We shouldn't.

40:04.903 --> 40:05.904
Maybe let's...

40:07.405 --> 40:08.406
Maybe let's chill.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.704
I want you in my mouth.

40:24.047 --> 40:25.048
Emma.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.968
You're gonna hate yourself
tomorrow for this.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.430
And I'm gonna hate that I didn't...

40:35.433 --> 40:37.144
That I let it happen.

40:56.496 --> 40:57.539
Because...

40:59.374 --> 41:01.418
...you're not yourself
right now, baby girl.

41:10.886 --> 41:11.887
Emma.

41:13.597 --> 41:14.598
Hey.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.394
Oh, fuck.
