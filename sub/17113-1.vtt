Hear that , Jack ?

Negative, dear .

05:12.964 --> 05:14.981
You know I stopped .

05:16.265 --> 05:18.387
Let's try <i>
few turns, right? </i>

05:18.388 --> 05:20.001
Tilt the <i> . </i>

05:20.002 --> 05:23.113
Right. Deviation of 60 Â° , Nero,
How about that?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.063
<i> tight belts , Rosie . </i>

05:25.064 --> 05:26.564
Understood .

05:36.533 --> 05:38.590
Okay , stabilize.

05:38.941 --> 05:41.612
We can scratch this
to-do list .

05:42.013 --> 05:46.026
When we meet face to face
with the Megalodon is much worse .

05:46.027 --> 05:48.340
I'll be ready
if you are , Rosie .

05:48.341 --> 05:50.171
Speaking <i> Megalodon . </i>

05:50.172 --> 05:53.729
The Coast Guard reported
that some vessels

05:53.730 --> 05:55.919
were sunk
by Megalodon on the Atlantic.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.609
Listen to this ...

05:57.610 --> 06:00.800
The engine were carrying
is now destroyed.

06:01.743 --> 06:03.293
I think this
is enough, no ?

06:03.294 --> 06:05.118
- My God.
I know.

06:05.119 --> 06:06.900
It is the seventh attack
in a week .

06:06.901 --> 06:10.670
If Engleberg not run,
Our help does not mean anything .

06:10.671 --> 06:13.156
<i> Rosie
I'm picking up something . </i>

06:13.157 --> 06:15.151
Careful , honey ,
you have company .

06:16.312 --> 06:20.152
<i> are giant squids .
Two of them , Rosie . </I></i>

06:20.153 --> 06:22.602
Looks like they want
a ride .

06:25.098 --> 06:27.619
but I'm not liking
this ride session.

06:30.938 --> 06:33.597
<i> Rosie ?
Rosie , check the pressure . </I></i>

06:33.598 --> 06:36.682
<i> hull undo
if they continue crushing . </i>

06:37.241 --> 06:39.809
Rosie , fast,
activate the eel skin .

06:39.810 --> 06:41.582
Nero start eel skin .

06:41.583 --> 06:43.520
<i> Sure, Rosie . </i>

06:43.521 --> 06:46.909
I will transfer the energy
to withdraw them quickly.

06:46.910 --> 06:49.944
<i> Beware the battery , Rosie .
Has yet to climb. </I></i>

06:49.945 --> 06:52.208
Do not need much
to scare them .

06:52.209 --> 06:53.694
I hope .

06:54.568 --> 06:55.901
<i> is with you , Nero. </i>

06:55.902 --> 06:57.914
Enable <i> eel skin . </i>

07:04.658 --> 07:06.541
now we know
it works.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.548
The power went <i>
to 30 % , Rosie . </i>

07:08.549 --> 07:10.801
Store this information
for later Nero.

07:10.802 --> 07:13.539
- We will need the information .
<i> Sure, Rosie . </i>

07:14.669 --> 07:16.250
<i> Not bad , dear . </i>

07:16.251 --> 07:17.958
Not bad at all .

07:17.959 --> 07:19.778
We're getting good at it ,
is not it?

07:20.407 --> 07:22.283
I am not convinced .

07:22.284 --> 07:25.338
That's when things
begin to worsen .

07:26.754 --> 07:29.019
My father always said ...

07:29.020 --> 07:32.068
URGENT MESSAGE

07:35.166 --> 07:37.044
Rosie , go back up .

07:37.045 --> 07:38.946
Need us
the docks .

07:39.504 --> 07:40.854
Ready <i> . </i>

07:40.855 --> 07:43.638
Already ?
Okay, I'm going up .

07:44.197 --> 07:45.497

08:23.821 --> 08:28.641
RESEARCH CENTER OF THE UN
PEARL HARBOR

08:54.722 --> 08:56.479
Loved it .

08:56.480 --> 08:58.071
I know you did .

09:00.045 --> 09:02.400
Dr. Turner , Dr. Gray ...

09:02.401 --> 09:04.488
Time to work .

09:11.466 --> 09:13.385
So , Admiral ,
all in conformity ?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.998
The majority .

09:14.999 --> 09:17.092
Made some changes
due to the weather .

09:17.093 --> 09:19.024
Let me introduce them .

09:19.025 --> 09:20.325
Right.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.896
Teeth .
Steel intermediate league.

09:25.897 --> 09:28.314
This is an improvement
compared to the original design .

09:28.315 --> 09:31.706
could increase
the compression strength of 40 MPa.

09:31.707 --> 09:34.659
40 ?
We were expecting 27 .

09:34.660 --> 09:36.266
will have
a bite tremendous .

09:36.267 --> 09:38.586
The pectoral now support

09:38.587 --> 09:41.870
UGN 133 ballistic torpedoes .

09:41.871 --> 09:43.373
Really?
Nuclear ?

09:43.374 --> 09:45.759
No, the UN has not approved
nuclear warheads .

09:45.760 --> 09:48.076
The British did not approve
but we're trying .

09:48.077 --> 09:49.389
Great .

09:49.390 --> 09:53.539
It's great , he can defend ourselves
without ruining the ocean .

09:53.540 --> 09:55.064
shit ,
here we go again .

09:55.065 --> 09:56.371
How so ?

09:56.372 --> 09:57.811
I just want to say that ...

09:57.812 --> 10:01.000
- I am worrying ...
It's like being a vegetarian ...

10:01.001 --> 10:03.051
But if I was ...
- Takes place and time .

10:03.052 --> 10:04.402
Do you know what material
radioactive

10:04.403 --> 10:06.603
was banned by the Convention
London in 1972 ?

10:06.604 --> 10:07.904
And then 73 and 78 .

10:07.905 --> 10:10.605
The Alm . understand his fascination
the obvious but now is not the time .

10:10.606 --> 10:12.449
If you can continue

10:12.450 --> 10:15.854
the vessel is coated
with eel skin .

10:15.855 --> 10:19.575
But the slots and tips
are reinforced titanium.

10:19.576 --> 10:21.375
And the rest of the exoskeleton ?

10:21.376 --> 10:23.215
The rest is stainless steel,

10:23.216 --> 10:25.426
a pressure -resistant
1024 kPa.

10:25.427 --> 10:28.893
It's the best we can do
these circumstances.

10:28.894 --> 10:33.650
But it is strong enough
to overcome the current submarines .

10:34.062 --> 10:36.136
It's incredible .
- Is .

10:36.137 --> 10:39.021
And is ready for action.

10:39.357 --> 10:42.824
You what?

10:43.394 --> 10:45.476
I have not installed Nero .

10:45.477 --> 10:47.281
That had not even
water testing.

10:47.282 --> 10:49.489
For Mach 1
now we have 2 ?

10:49.490 --> 10:51.474
We have no time
to waste the docks .

10:51.475 --> 10:54.646
We have to run with it .
We have already lost many lives .

10:54.647 --> 10:56.546
Including my brother .

10:56.998 --> 10:58.921
And I do not like to lose.

10:58.922 --> 11:00.256
I'm ready .

11:00.257 --> 11:03.455
Excellent . Prepare
to leave immediately .

11:03.456 --> 11:04.767
Alright .

11:04.768 --> 11:06.776
Wait . Rosie .

11:07.261 --> 11:08.838
Rosie !

11:08.839 --> 11:10.625
Can we talk about this?

11:14.340 --> 11:17.674
Get <i> things , guys .
We're coming back . </I></i>

11:17.675 --> 11:19.941
The harbor master
have a heart attack

11:19.942 --> 11:21.620
when you see
we went to the sea.

11:21.621 --> 11:23.681
Unhook the Goths .
We're going home .

11:37.814 --> 11:42.084
PORT OF SYDNEY , AUSTRALIA

11:46.712 --> 11:48.837
What a joke !
Where is everybody ?

11:49.927 --> 11:52.024
Let's talk
with that guy .

11:52.025 --> 11:53.605
Excuse me, sir .

11:53.606 --> 11:56.463
Would you mind if we interview
on the prohibition of fishing

11:56.464 --> 11:58.272
and how will it affect your life ?

12:00.447 --> 12:02.397
Yes, of course . Sorry.

12:02.398 --> 12:04.849
<i> Here in the cove
with a local fisherman. </i>

12:04.850 --> 12:07.692
<i> Now that the ban on fishing
UN is in place </i>

12:07.693 --> 12:09.924
<i> as expected

12:10.787 --> 12:13.999
<i> There is plenty to talk about, </i>

12:14.000 --> 12:16.663
<i> the ban is already in force ,
no what to do . </i>

12:17.625 --> 12:21.646
<i> Most anglers are
ignoring , entering anyway . </i>

12:22.032 --> 12:24.015
Do not be afraid of the Megalodon ?

12:24.877 --> 12:27.065
At first , no.

12:27.066 --> 12:30.493
We had more fear of not
can put food in the house .

12:30.494 --> 12:31.869
And losing our homes .

12:31.870 --> 12:34.688
<i> Our greatest fear is to have the boat
seized by the Coast Guard . </i>

12:34.689 --> 12:36.514
Are more concerned
with your family

12:36.515 --> 12:38.404
than the actual
security?

12:38.405 --> 12:39.992
<i> course we are . </i>

12:41.233 --> 12:42.822
Or were <i> . </i>

12:44.485 --> 12:46.400
<i> But after today ... </i>

12:47.111 --> 12:49.762
Knew someone boat
which was destroyed today?

12:50.878 --> 12:52.338
<i> Yes </i>

12:52.339 --> 12:56.462
My son was on that boat
destroyed by that shark .

12:56.849 --> 12:58.911
This is horrible .

12:58.912 --> 13:01.442
We <i> the station
sorry ... </i>

13:01.443 --> 13:04.456
We have <i>
a huge technology. </i>

13:04.457 --> 13:08.675
The UN, U.S.
or Navy itself

13:08.676 --> 13:10.279
<i> can not do something ? </i>

13:10.280 --> 13:13.195
Something to stop <i>
this creature ? </i>

13:15.638 --> 13:17.550
I'm sorry ,
I can no longer continue .

13:17.551 --> 13:19.337
- Sir ...
I'm so sorry .

13:19.997 --> 13:22.994
<i> okay . this tragedy
is being felt around the world </i>

13:22.995 --> 13:25.915
<i> and I'm sure the military
are doing what they can </i>

13:25.916 --> 13:27.534

Here is <i> Anny Cook .

13:32.001 --> 13:34.633
You will win a prize
reporting , sure .

13:34.634 --> 13:36.680
Shut up , asshole .

13:58.677 --> 14:00.460
Rosie , can not be
serious.

14:00.461 --> 14:03.750
Not going down without Nero
in a submersible without testing.

14:04.179 --> 14:05.927
I can do this , Jack .

14:05.928 --> 14:07.855
I know you can .
You are amazing .

14:07.856 --> 14:10.882
Could fly anything,
but no matter .

14:11.490 --> 14:13.652
If something goes wrong
downstairs ,

14:13.653 --> 14:15.605
wrong shot torpedo ...

14:16.329 --> 14:19.763
I'll be without a wife .
But I have to say ...

14:19.764 --> 14:22.474
And I'm kind of attached to it .

14:23.724 --> 14:26.061
We are running out of time .

14:26.062 --> 14:27.888
The Megalodon is back .

14:29.729 --> 14:32.593
This is not an attempt
to redeem himself , is it?

14:32.594 --> 14:37.477
A feeling of guilt is
feel responsible for what happened .

14:37.478 --> 14:39.161
That's what I do .

14:39.162 --> 14:41.920
I'm good at it .
I can fly this thing .

14:42.508 --> 14:46.246
- Not alone , Rosie .
- Not alone , I need you there.

14:46.247 --> 14:48.262
You are my engineer.

14:53.948 --> 14:56.379
This is the work
of a lifetime.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.068
I'll do,
they need me there.

15:00.134 --> 15:02.208
Three times in a lifetime .

15:02.209 --> 15:04.021
Three times .

15:04.868 --> 15:06.279
Now I have time.

15:06.789 --> 15:09.804
This is the third time
that the Megalodon back .

15:24.172 --> 15:26.933
Sir, you better answer .

15:29.123 --> 15:30.931
Here is the Alm . Engleberg .

15:30.932 --> 15:33.241
Admiral
Here is Dr. Emma MacNeil .

15:33.242 --> 15:34.976
Hello , Dr. MacNeil .

15:34.977 --> 15:36.573
How can I help her ?

15:36.574 --> 15:38.567
I'm calling
to help you , actually.

15:38.568 --> 15:42.645
Analyzed based information
the migratory and feeding patterns

15:42.646 --> 15:46.845
and it seems that our friend
will be a little longer .

15:46.846 --> 15:49.573
Understood .
It's an instinctive thing .

15:49.574 --> 15:52.414
I do not think go anywhere
without a mate .

15:52.415 --> 15:55.765
You have an animal
very aggressive in hand .

16:05.152 --> 16:07.870
<i> Contact Megalodon .
50 Meters. </I></i>

16:07.871 --> 16:09.217
We will attack , sir ?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.185
- Shark ?
Contact - positive .

16:11.816 --> 16:13.167
Hanson .

16:14.275 --> 16:16.964
Get a line with
Admiral Engleberg . Now .

16:17.432 --> 16:21.580
AREA OF NORTH SHORE
AUSTRALIA'S , MAR ARAFURA

16:41.230 --> 16:43.856
This reminds me of that week
in the Maldives .

16:44.216 --> 16:45.823
Remember?

16:46.491 --> 16:50.090
oysters
and the cool breeze of nature .

16:50.091 --> 16:52.495
Is towing a shark
giant metallic

16:52.496 --> 16:54.754
and it reminds you the Maldives ?

16:54.755 --> 16:56.667
Not the shark , silly .

16:56.668 --> 16:57.968
You.

17:01.069 --> 17:03.144
The wind blowing her hair .

17:03.145 --> 17:05.627
The sun , shining on your skin .

17:08.039 --> 17:09.791
Doubted when they said
I was ...

17:09.792 --> 17:11.098
<i> U.S.S. Virginia ... </i>

17:11.098 --> 17:13.875
just identified
our fish .

17:15.973 --> 17:18.644
We are going towards it
right now.

17:18.645 --> 17:21.964
But Nero is not ready .
I do not need a pilot with Nero.

17:23.271 --> 17:25.298
He controls his death , Dr.

17:25.299 --> 17:27.174
Do not thank me yet.

17:27.175 --> 17:29.932
Admiral .
We are now in the target area .

17:30.416 --> 17:32.013
Showtime.

18:17.254 --> 18:18.815
Show me now .

18:21.084 --> 18:22.782
Nothing on the radar yet.

18:23.646 --> 18:25.019
How are you, darling ?

18:27.011 --> 18:29.224
Not bad .
Clumsy , but nothing bad.

18:29.225 --> 18:30.525
Understood .

18:31.016 --> 18:34.165
I see nothing in transponder
or crawler.

18:41.940 --> 18:43.632
Think you missed it ?

18:44.772 --> 18:46.739
Maybe not .

18:46.740 --> 18:48.740
Damn , this thing is great
as true .

18:48.741 --> 18:51.608
we're screwed
if that does not work .

18:52.990 --> 18:55.661
Lord , is the Megalodon .

18:56.099 --> 18:57.867
Arm torpedoes .

18:57.868 --> 18:59.566
<i> armed submarines . </i>

19:07.833 --> 19:09.611
I have something on the radar .

19:10.492 --> 19:12.376
Understood .
We're it , seeing Rosie .

19:12.377 --> 19:14.109
At two o'clock.

19:14.110 --> 19:15.410
It is huge .

19:16.843 --> 19:18.143
Diverting .

19:18.606 --> 19:21.074
Rotating 20 degrees ,
dear .

19:24.367 --> 19:25.960
I see nothing .

19:31.718 --> 19:34.002
<i> Mega plunged 25 meters. </i>

<i> Ready to fire . </i>

19:38.228 --> 19:40.183
Give me a moment ,
Captain .

19:41.096 --> 19:43.743
Let me first mark the Mega
should he escape .

19:45.825 --> 19:47.837
Armando
projectile tracking .

19:47.838 --> 19:49.817
Tracking system
active.

19:54.525 --> 19:57.058
Mega - was marked .
Understood .

19:57.453 --> 19:59.853
GPS signal
is being transmitted .

20:00.549 --> 20:03.484
Maybe we have something , Rosie .
We accompany him .

20:03.485 --> 20:06.695
Captain Zane , who says to Me
to make a hole this big boy ?

20:06.696 --> 20:08.217
Yes, ma'am .

20:13.652 --> 20:14.952
Hit him .

20:15.567 --> 20:17.330
Shoot 1 .

20:18.569 --> 20:20.399
Torpedo in the water , sir .

20:21.150 --> 20:22.450
Just in time .

20:22.841 --> 20:25.424
Stand back, Rosie .
Shot him .

20:25.425 --> 20:27.475
Away .
Coming out of the firing line .

20:38.237 --> 20:40.276
Lord , we were hit .

21:01.128 --> 21:03.057
Captain Zane ,
can you hear me ?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.557
Captain Zane ,
can you hear me ?

21:16.815 --> 21:18.874
multiple explosions
underwater.

21:18.875 --> 21:20.814
Virginia
is no communication .

21:22.888 --> 21:24.982
He ended the submarine .

21:25.765 --> 21:27.065
Damn .

21:27.518 --> 21:29.377
<i> What happened out there
staff? </i>

21:29.378 --> 21:32.741
Jack , U.S.S. Virginia is not
Responding? Did something happen ?

21:36.162 --> 21:38.104
He ended up with Virginia
Rosie .

21:40.113 --> 21:41.869
I'm catching the shot.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.563
Shooting .

21:55.812 --> 21:57.112
Jack .

21:57.113 --> 21:59.980
Jack , he fled .
Not on my radar .

21:59.981 --> 22:01.802
<i> GPS is still transmitting . </i>

22:02.230 --> 22:04.363
my controls
are not responding .

22:05.720 --> 22:08.233
I'm emerging,
but will not be pretty .

22:09.880 --> 22:11.664
I'll meet you up there .

22:20.552 --> 22:23.188
I could have shot
at the same time .

22:23.189 --> 22:25.153
It's not your fault.
Right. Stop it, please .

22:26.768 --> 22:28.706
had friends
that sub .

22:28.707 --> 22:30.383
436 lives.

22:30.384 --> 22:32.780
-I'm sorry .
I do not want excuses .

22:32.781 --> 22:35.612
Need results
positive .

22:35.613 --> 22:37.108
Do you want results ?

22:37.109 --> 22:39.340
So give me a break
to restore Nero.

22:39.341 --> 22:41.953
How much time do you need ?
- Not much .

22:42.882 --> 22:44.990
All I need is get him
Mecha - 1 ...

22:44.991 --> 22:47.364
and enter it in the system
encoded tail .

22:47.365 --> 22:49.078
Maybe lose one day.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.022
Look, we're tracking it
GPS .

22:53.023 --> 22:54.714
So we will not miss
he sight .

22:55.777 --> 22:58.249
Okay , do .

23:17.153 --> 23:19.596
<i> I'm operating . </i>

23:19.597 --> 23:21.782
Good to hear your voice ,

23:21.783 --> 23:23.209
<i> will not light it? </i>

23:23.210 --> 23:24.510
<i> is not it, Jack ? </i>

23:25.083 --> 23:26.471
<i> Jack ? </i>

23:28.258 --> 23:30.471
Of course I will not light.

23:33.707 --> 23:35.072
Listen , buddy .

23:35.073 --> 23:37.897
Run the system diagnostics
for me, right ?

23:38.957 --> 23:40.779
Running <i> diagnosis. </i>

23:40.780 --> 23:42.120
<i> Where is Rosie ? </i>

23:42.121 --> 23:45.066
Rosie is the vessel monitoring
the GPS signal .

23:45.067 --> 23:47.823
I am also picking <i>
a GPS signal . </i>

23:47.824 --> 23:49.395
<i> Moving fast. </i>

23:50.559 --> 23:52.261
Okay , keep it.

23:52.262 --> 23:54.717
Means that their radars are
fully functional .

23:54.718 --> 23:56.810
<i> All Operating Systems

24:03.457 --> 24:07.300
I have good news and bad news
For You , Nero.

24:07.301 --> 24:11.136
The good news is that you and Rose
have much more to play with.

24:11.996 --> 24:13.467
The bad news is ...

24:13.772 --> 24:15.350
this time it's for real .

24:15.351 --> 24:17.184
<i> can count on me , Jack . </i>

24:17.185 --> 24:19.021
<i> I'll take care of Rose . </i>

E. .. Nero?

24:26.619 --> 24:28.195
Try not to miss

24:29.048 --> 24:30.483
Rose already has an owner .

24:52.729 --> 24:55.571
- So?
- Your boyfriend agreed .

24:55.572 --> 24:57.280

" Event on the Horizon "

25:56.741 --> 25:58.714
after the attack the Megalodon , today.

25:58.715 --> 26:00.315
Rescuers
are in place

26:00.316 --> 26:02.754
and the retrieval team
is on the way .

26:02.755 --> 26:04.755
If they can not
contain the spill

26:04.756 --> 26:06.177
This ancestral environment

26:06.178 --> 26:08.613
runs the risk of
an ecological disaster

26:08.614 --> 26:13.466
as we see from the leak
Oil in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 .

26:26.279 --> 26:28.389
How we doing , baby?

26:28.390 --> 26:30.803
Keeping afloat .

26:32.132 --> 26:34.895
On my screen , everything normal.
And you , how are you?

26:34.896 --> 26:37.476
All systems <i>

26:37.477 --> 26:39.107
Good to have you back , buddy .

26:39.108 --> 26:42.027
How about we take this shark
there to the back once ?

26:42.028 --> 26:43.522
<i> Certainly , Rose . </i>

26:50.433 --> 26:51.982
Good vital signs .

26:52.290 --> 26:54.553

be my fault ?

26:56.502 --> 26:58.278
All ready to submerge .

26:58.279 --> 26:59.745
And good luck .

26:59.746 --> 27:02.981

Nero, can you hear me ?

27:21.250 --> 27:22.929
Rose , are you listening?

27:25.963 --> 27:28.433
<i> water pressure

Come on honey . Come on, come on .

27:32.248 --> 27:34.612
<i> System restarted . </i>

27:35.194 --> 27:37.454

I'm here , you hear?

27:39.978 --> 27:42.228
<i> I see you now .
What happened ? </I></i>

27:42.229 --> 27:45.151
I do not know . systems

27:45.152 --> 27:46.802
<i> not do that again . </i>

27:46.803 --> 27:48.492
Will give me a heart attack .

27:48.493 --> 27:52.735
<i> Blame it on Nero.
Lowering to 1000 feet, slowly . </I></i>

27:52.736 --> 27:55.920
Chad ,

27:59.806 --> 28:01.192
Nothing yet , sir .

28:03.535 --> 28:06.307
According to GPS
you're right on it .

28:07.307 --> 28:08.957
Use camouflage. Rates .

28:09.586 --> 28:10.910
Triggering camouflage.

28:10.911 --> 28:13.905
<i> Cloud camouflage in 100 % . </i>

28:22.103 --> 28:23.403
My father always said ...

<i> 1100 meters ... </i>

28:24.852 --> 28:26.848
<i> Nothing in sonar . </i>

28:31.374 --> 28:34.720
Understood .
Nothing here yet .

28:34.721 --> 28:38.492
Nero , expand the reach of sonar
25 meters.

28:38.493 --> 28:40.915
<i> right, Jack .
Extended reach . </I></i>

28:41.616 --> 28:44.416
TARGET LOCATED

28:46.786 --> 28:48.357
Knew it was there .

28:48.358 --> 28:50.911
Possible identification <i>
Megalodon . </i>

28:50.912 --> 28:52.702
Yes , but where is he ?

28:52.703 --> 28:54.460
Rosie , it's going fast.

28:54.461 --> 28:56.617
You're right there
Wait . I saw , I saw .

29:03.447 --> 29:04.947
Time to work , Dr. Gray .

29:04.948 --> 29:06.658
Yes , sir .

29:28.803 --> 29:30.728
This does not . Saw what I saw ?

29:31.097 --> 29:32.565
This is bad .

29:32.566 --> 29:34.305
Too bad .

29:37.323 --> 29:39.438
Someone bring me
a phone to TV.

29:39.439 --> 29:40.843
Now !

29:43.816 --> 29:45.222
I'm standing here ,

29:45.223 --> 29:48.619

29:48.620 --> 29:50.341
I'll get us

29:50.342 --> 29:52.242
Understood . Get out of there .

29:52.582 --> 29:54.947
Try a direct hit ,
but does not reach the pipe .

29:54.948 --> 29:57.429
I repeat : not reach the pipe .

29:57.752 --> 30:00.259

Is to my left.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.905

30:02.906 --> 30:04.266
<i> What about casting ? </i>

30:04.267 --> 30:07.686
Yes , yes .
So send someone up there!

30:09.445 --> 30:11.730
We have to shut down that pipe .

30:11.731 --> 30:14.422
They can not .
They can not ?

30:14.423 --> 30:17.751
What do you mean can not ?
- As in " can not " .

30:22.268 --> 30:24.370
Personal , tubing

30:24.371 --> 30:26.588
Ignore any damage
Dr. side Gray,

30:26.589 --> 30:28.195
its mission
is to kill the shark .

30:28.196 --> 30:29.773
Go to mend it?

30:29.774 --> 30:32.627
Then now you
have to follow the Megalodon .

30:32.628 --> 30:34.128
Rosie
they can not turn off .

30:34.129 --> 30:35.924
What?
- They need to do manually .

30:35.925 --> 30:37.561
Has no off button ?

30:38.189 --> 30:39.829
Are sending engineers .

30:40.262 --> 30:42.028
Listen , we need to do something .

30:42.029 --> 30:43.509
Not ! Negative.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.451
Your orders are below the target.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.928
Lord , if it does nothing ,

30:46.929 --> 30:50.675
will be 42,000 gallons of oil
refined not leaking in the ocean

30:50.676 --> 30:52.176
causing irreparable damage .

30:52.177 --> 30:55.132
It turns out that we have no time
calling Greenpeace .

30:55.133 --> 30:58.434
Nero? What I mean
with irreparable harm ?

30:58.435 --> 31:00.579
Are you referring <i>
toxic contamination , </i>

31:00.580 --> 31:02.970
<i> embryonic inviability
hydrocarbons , </i>

31:02.971 --> 31:05.354
<i> biochemical damage
in the marine ecosystem , </i>

31:05.355 --> 31:08.488
coastal erosion . Not to mention ...
- Okay . Okay . Enough.

31:09.273 --> 31:10.781
Can we make this quick ?

31:13.354 --> 31:15.543
You need to seal
tubing, Rosie .

31:16.386 --> 31:17.792
And have to hurry .

31:21.040 --> 31:22.984
Right. Got something .

31:22.985 --> 31:26.815
Okay , we have to go over .
Are you with me ?

31:26.816 --> 31:29.258
<i> Right. Understand , Rosie . </I></i>

31:41.252 --> 31:44.149
<i> Based on your reading ,
main leak was contained . </i>

31:46.211 --> 31:47.823
Great job , honey .

31:47.824 --> 31:50.859
You also <i> , Nero.
Let's return to action , Rosie . </I></i>

31:50.860 --> 31:53.400
You have a big fish to fish .

31:53.401 --> 31:57.075
Jack , you only see the right direction
and we are ready , is not Nero?

31:57.076 --> 31:58.622
<i> Okay , Rosie . </i>

31:59.543 --> 32:00.969
Here we go .

32:09.354 --> 32:14.209
Here is <i> Decode 1007
declaring a state of emergency. </i>

32:14.210 --> 32:18.967
I repeat : Decode 1007
declaring an emergency.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.323
Keep trying .

32:22.136 --> 32:25.420
already
in restricted airspace .

32:25.421 --> 32:27.731
Decode 1007
here is the control of Guam,

32:27.732 --> 32:30.726
you're in restricted airspace .
Alter course immediately.

32:31.225 --> 32:33.733
Guam,
're low fuel

32:33.734 --> 32:36.140
and we need to go straight to ...

32:36.141 --> 32:38.512
- RER .
Airport - RER .

32:38.513 --> 32:40.015
In the Cook Islands .

32:40.016 --> 32:41.381
I repeat :

32:41.382 --> 32:43.937
we are
with low fuel

32:43.938 --> 32:45.705
and we have to continue.

32:45.706 --> 32:47.442
Negative Decode 1007 .

32:47.443 --> 32:48.949
Change your course
immediately.

32:48.950 --> 32:52.091
Are well on the last incident
Megalodon .

32:52.492 --> 32:53.792
I know .

32:54.247 --> 32:55.686
Decode 1007

32:55.687 --> 33:00.042
can change the course to 2-8-0
and follow to the IUE Yune Island ?

33:00.043 --> 33:01.697
Negative, Guam.

33:03.963 --> 33:07.893
Lord , a commercial 727
entered into restricted space .

33:07.894 --> 33:09.846
Megalodon is in the zone.

33:13.114 --> 33:15.141
Rosie , you can do something ?

33:15.857 --> 33:17.208
Leave it to me .

33:22.243 --> 33:25.937
What are these two points
that appeared near 1007 ?

33:27.062 --> 33:30.770
Decode 1007, check
two points in its flight level .

33:33.914 --> 33:37.265
- What the hell ?
- My God.

33:37.266 --> 33:39.204
Decode <i> 1007, repeat: </i>

33:39.205 --> 33:42.653
can check two objects
not identified in its route ?

33:49.551 --> 33:51.996
The dots are gone .

33:55.405 --> 33:57.364
<i> Decode 1007 ? </i>

33:57.873 --> 34:01.978
Altering course to 2-8-0 .

34:01.979 --> 34:03.693
en route to SUI.

34:06.079 --> 34:07.973
Damn the lack of fuel .

34:10.762 --> 34:14.054
Satellite data
are confused .

34:14.056 --> 34:15.981
<i> He's moving fast. </i>

34:15.982 --> 34:17.482
<i> Position northeast. </i>

34:17.483 --> 34:19.797
I'm right here .
Catching target.

34:23.952 --> 34:25.906
Nero, what happened ?

34:35.920 --> 34:38.853
You see that?
The GPS deleted .

34:38.855 --> 34:40.908
<i> The hull is 100 % intact , Rosie . </i>

34:40.909 --> 34:42.817
Hopefully it stays that way .

34:47.266 --> 34:50.409
<i> Grab it now , Rosie .
Aim for the 2nd dorsal fin . </I></i>

34:50.409 --> 34:51.710
Catching target.

34:51.710 --> 34:55.234
Be sure to have it in sight.
Remember that we're here .

34:55.536 --> 34:57.359
Invoking the two.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.209
Firing .

35:05.228 --> 35:07.531
Staff deviated from the torpedo.

35:07.532 --> 35:10.051
-I can not hit him .
- Impossible .

35:10.052 --> 35:12.226
Lord ,
have a point approaching.

35:12.227 --> 35:15.346
No, no ! APB .
The whole crew . Now !

35:15.347 --> 35:17.110
Yes, sir .
- Is someone getting?

35:17.111 --> 35:19.786
<i> Attention all posts ...
- Jack . Jack ? </I></i>

35:19.787 --> 35:23.562
We receive , and we are trying
prevent deaths . Hang in there.

35:47.563 --> 35:48.863
My God.

35:49.649 --> 35:51.347
What did I do ?

35:54.003 --> 35:56.096
All that boat , Jack ...

35:56.097 --> 35:57.502
Stop , Rosie .

35:58.499 --> 35:59.897
It was not your fault.

36:00.362 --> 36:02.268
My God.

36:05.663 --> 36:08.064
<i> That does not help at all . </i>

36:08.668 --> 36:10.286
Forget it .

36:10.628 --> 36:13.669
Let's kick the butt
this shark.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.077
Get it?

36:15.078 --> 36:17.534
Okay , I'm fine .
- Good girl .

36:21.728 --> 36:23.845
No eye contact .

36:23.846 --> 36:25.468
Where is he, Nero?

36:25.469 --> 36:27.966
<i> Rank 11 hours.
20 degrees up . </I></i>

36:27.967 --> 36:30.977
You can leave .
Changing the auxiliary propellant.

36:30.978 --> 36:32.463
I want to jump on him .

36:36.042 --> 36:37.821
Going down to the narrow .

36:37.822 --> 36:39.579
Rosie is wide enough ?

36:39.580 --> 36:41.523
If he could get ,
I can too.

36:41.524 --> 36:43.925
<i> We got Rosie .
Assumed command . </I></i>

36:43.926 --> 36:46.943
Leave it to me .
It will not escape so easily .

36:46.944 --> 36:49.648
<i> Wait for confirmation
before shooting , Rosie . </i>

36:53.885 --> 36:56.908
He's hurt ,
but it will not slow you down .

36:56.909 --> 36:58.397
I will try again .

37:00.710 --> 37:02.911
<i> Alert ! Alert ! </I></i>

37:03.215 --> 37:06.616
Structural Damage: 10 % .
- This was very close .

37:07.105 --> 37:08.730
I'll get that son of a bitch .

37:08.731 --> 37:10.609
<i> Rosie
I'm not in the locked target. </i>

37:10.610 --> 37:11.939
I am .

37:18.905 --> 37:21.345
<i> Rosie , hold up .
Imminent collision . </I></i>

37:21.346 --> 37:22.935
I can avoid.

37:29.206 --> 37:30.829
Rosie , you listening?

37:31.348 --> 37:32.648
Rosie ?

37:33.066 --> 37:34.774
Rosie answer , Rosie .

37:35.334 --> 37:36.712
Rosie answer .

37:39.906 --> 37:41.206
Rosie ?

37:56.409 --> 37:59.043
- What is the situation , sir ?
We lost two boats .

37:59.044 --> 38:02.180
Multiple low - ...
Come on, Rosie . Chord.

38:02.181 --> 38:05.156
What happened ?
- It seems that there was a slip .

38:05.157 --> 38:07.572
We lost contact.
- Rosie Exchange .

38:07.573 --> 38:09.947
- Rosie , are you listening ?
Talk to me , Jack .

38:09.948 --> 38:11.422
There I catch anything.

38:11.423 --> 38:14.288
Appears to be full ,
but I can not sign.

38:14.869 --> 38:17.245
She is stuck there and can only
sit here .

38:17.246 --> 38:19.041
Screaming her name .

38:19.042 --> 38:20.546
Junk .

38:21.200 --> 38:22.566
And Nero?

38:22.923 --> 38:24.550
Not Responding .

38:36.389 --> 38:38.701
<i> System Restore
in progress. </i>

38:38.702 --> 38:41.173
<i> Rosie ? Rosie ? </I></i>

39:10.560 --> 39:11.904
Rosie ?

39:12.669 --> 39:14.409
Rosie , are you listening ?

39:14.410 --> 39:16.394
<i> Hello, Jack . </i>

39:17.530 --> 39:18.957
Nero, as is Rosie ?

39:18.958 --> 39:21.885
<i> She's fine . reading
Vital Signs booting . </i>

39:21.886 --> 39:23.739
Nero, can return to the surface ?

39:23.740 --> 39:26.502
<i> negative .
It seems that we are stuck , Jack . </I></i>

39:29.608 --> 39:32.553
She is on the edge of the canyon .

39:33.750 --> 39:35.576
Nero , try the thrusters .

39:35.577 --> 39:37.371
Fuel - scarce.
- Sir ...

39:37.372 --> 39:39.714
I can not strongly enough
to escape .

39:41.045 --> 39:42.749
Message of James Stuart .

39:42.750 --> 39:45.422
Is 74 km away and answered
our request for help.

39:45.423 --> 39:47.473
Tell them to come quick .

39:47.474 --> 39:49.668
And without attracting attention .
Yes, sir .

39:59.407 --> 40:01.263
Overall sound alert !

40:01.264 --> 40:04.517
Someone show this
who decided to fight us.

40:04.518 --> 40:06.640
Trace - Captain , is the mega - shark.
What do you have ?

40:06.641 --> 40:08.043
Well, he ...

40:22.088 --> 40:24.370
To combat stations !
Now !

40:29.654 --> 40:31.540
We can not
launch all fighters

40:31.541 --> 40:33.414
but we will try
put as much in the air .

40:33.415 --> 40:35.242
This aircraft carrier
is rocking too .

40:35.243 --> 40:37.134
We can not
launch as well .

40:37.135 --> 40:39.389
We need fighters in the air ,
then try .

40:39.390 --> 40:41.738
It's suicide.
You're kidding , right?

40:41.739 --> 40:43.469
We're just being careful .

40:43.470 --> 40:45.771
turn man
and do your job , sailor .

40:45.772 --> 40:48.401
Any of you have a problem
to launch now?

40:49.028 --> 40:50.703
No, sir.
Are you sure?

40:50.704 --> 40:53.327
Because if not,
I swear I put you on a boat

40:53.328 --> 40:56.484
with a water bottle , a can
to shit and send you to your mother .

40:56.885 --> 40:58.546
No, sir .

40:58.547 --> 41:00.220
No, sir.
- Great .

41:00.221 --> 41:02.387
Come on by these fighters in the air .
Yes, sir .

41:19.095 --> 41:21.644
<i> Jack , I have the solution . </i>

41:21.645 --> 41:23.450
Okay , Nero,
What 's on your mind ?

41:25.533 --> 41:26.968
What will he do?

41:26.969 --> 41:30.389
Obviously something pretty stupid .
Nero, what are you doing ?

41:30.390 --> 41:33.720
<i> Calculation in progress.
Trust me , Jack . </I></i>

41:34.498 --> 41:36.062
He blocked me .

41:36.063 --> 41:39.384
Can he do this ?
Yes, it can .

41:48.923 --> 41:51.248
Nero , you're lucky
this worked .

41:51.249 --> 41:53.067
My calculations <i>
were right . </i>

41:53.068 --> 41:54.609
Climbing <i> now . </i>

41:54.610 --> 41:56.253
<i> hurry. </i>

41:56.254 --> 41:58.322
I want to kiss my wife .

42:00.153 --> 42:02.055
Lord , is the captain Trace .

42:02.957 --> 42:04.257
Captain ?

42:04.258 --> 42:06.406
Admiral
we are under attack !

42:06.407 --> 42:07.805
<i> is the Megalodon ! </i>

42:08.952 --> 42:12.357
Wait , you're saying
it is an attack of the Megalodon ?

42:12.358 --> 42:13.820
That makes no sense .

42:13.821 --> 42:16.192
There must be another reason
Megalodon to attack him .

42:16.193 --> 42:18.292
Something must have attracted
Shark.

42:18.293 --> 42:19.687
Of course he is hungry

42:19.688 --> 42:22.339
but is randomly attacking
an aircraft carrier ?

42:22.851 --> 42:26.444
Captain Trace , which his ship
was doing before the attack ?

42:27.195 --> 42:29.771
We were testing our
emitting high frequency .

42:30.152 --> 42:32.080
testing emitters
High frequency .

42:32.081 --> 42:33.558
Are still testing ?

42:33.559 --> 42:36.159
Tell them to stop , it is
what is irritating the creature .

42:36.160 --> 42:39.612
Captain Trace , are the issuers.
Stop the test immediately .

42:39.613 --> 42:40.967
<i> Yes , sir </i>

42:40.968 --> 42:42.926
Shut off all
transmissions now !

42:42.927 --> 42:44.845
Yes , sir .
Canceling battle test.

42:50.211 --> 42:51.818
I think it worked ,
Captain .

43:02.248 --> 43:03.659
Captain Trace ?

43:03.660 --> 43:05.009
Captain ?

43:05.010 --> 43:06.770
The connection was interrupted ,
sir.

43:30.463 --> 43:32.952
The lives of over 5000 families
of members

43:32.953 --> 43:36.493
the U.S.S. James Stuart
turned upside down today

43:36.494 --> 43:41.021
when the huge Megalodon sank
carrier violently.

43:41.022 --> 43:43.598
Monetary funds were sent
by various organizations

43:43.599 --> 43:47.300
and you can see the number
in the footer or on our website .

43:55.518 --> 43:57.875
Rosie !

43:59.202 --> 44:01.929
Is she okay ?
- No .

44:02.345 --> 44:03.718
We have to get her out .

44:06.246 --> 44:08.660
- Speak!
- CVN89 was shot , sir .

44:08.661 --> 44:10.012
What?

44:12.070 --> 44:14.706
The U.S.S. James Stuart
just been slaughtered .

44:14.707 --> 44:16.814
All staff was lost .

44:17.505 --> 44:20.352
That leaves us
in a bad doctor .

44:20.353 --> 44:21.901
Because this ship
who was shot

44:21.902 --> 44:25.215
took the only two riders
we trained for this mission .

44:25.216 --> 44:28.415
- If you are Rosie ...
- Rosie is unconditionally Alm .

44:28.416 --> 44:30.740
We may lose a few hours ,
but who cares ?

44:30.741 --> 44:34.054
<i> Jack ? </i>
What was Nero?

44:34.055 --> 44:37.333
<i> Can I drive alone .
That's what I was raised . </I></i>

44:37.334 --> 44:40.014
Someday .
Still can not fly alone.

44:40.015 --> 44:41.884
<i> Jack , I can do this . </i>

44:41.885 --> 44:44.842
<i> Admiral is correct ,
We can not waste time . </i>

44:44.843 --> 44:47.250
<i> Megalodon
reach populated areas . </i>

44:47.251 --> 44:49.318
<i> Low
can be enormous . </i>

44:49.319 --> 44:52.013
Nero can fight alone ?

44:52.014 --> 44:53.314
Theoretically .

44:53.315 --> 44:56.164
- We have a self-destruct ?
Theoretically .

44:57.856 --> 45:00.683
Nero, the Mecha is yours.

45:00.684 --> 45:02.961
but accept
my orders .

45:02.962 --> 45:04.683
<i> Certainly , Admiral .
Thank you . </I></i>

45:04.684 --> 45:06.338
Come on, honey .
I'll get her out .

45:13.578 --> 45:15.156
<i> Mom . </i>

45:15.157 --> 45:16.934
<i> Look at the camera , Olivia . </i>

45:18.873 --> 45:21.003
<i> Mom , I do not feel well . </i>

45:21.004 --> 45:22.791
<i> Okay dear ,
Daddy is here. </i>

45:22.792 --> 45:24.104
<i> I love you . </i>

45:24.105 --> 45:26.671
I'm so sorry ,
but her daughter is very sick . 

45:26.672 --> 45:28.300
<i> I love you so much . </i>

45:29.145 --> 45:33.056
It is always difficult <i>
losing someone so young . </i>

45:33.057 --> 45:35.021
<i> Let's get over it ,
dear . </i>

45:36.331 --> 45:38.687
<i> Rosie ! </i>

45:38.688 --> 45:40.365
<i> Come back to me , darling . </i>

45:42.354 --> 45:44.045
<i> can not. </i>

45:56.600 --> 45:58.659
Jack , what happened ?

46:00.257 --> 46:04.045
Nothing, just one of the moments
most terrifying of my life .

46:04.046 --> 46:05.644
I have to go back there .

46:06.142 --> 46:08.279
It's too late , baby.
He was .

46:08.280 --> 46:09.943
How so ' gone ' ?

46:10.342 --> 46:11.851
Nero is in control .

46:13.575 --> 46:16.258
Are you kidding ?
He has not been debugged .

46:16.259 --> 46:18.064
Was the order of the admiral .

46:18.538 --> 46:21.428
He did not think
you back in time .

46:21.429 --> 46:24.867
It was nothing.
I was only half conscious .

46:25.484 --> 46:27.867
It was more than that, dear .

46:31.927 --> 46:34.387
- You will be fine .
I'm worried that 's it.

46:34.388 --> 46:38.761
<i> Attention all stations ,
Mecha approaching the wreckage. </i>

46:50.099 --> 46:52.729
<i> I have several large targets
moving . </i>

46:52.730 --> 46:55.517
<i> Can not say
if any of them is the Megalodon . </i>

46:55.518 --> 46:58.120
There are no records
Megalodon , Lord .

47:00.648 --> 47:03.645
<i> Just a moment . </i>

47:10.585 --> 47:12.711
Enable <i> eel skin . </i>

47:21.369 --> 47:23.309
<i> damage on the rear fin. </i>

47:33.430 --> 47:35.722
Problems <i> engine ... </i>

47:39.171 --> 47:41.803
<i> submerged Fluctuations
detected . </i>

47:43.455 --> 47:46.273
- Nero?
What 's going on ?

47:46.274 --> 47:47.964
I do not know ,
the computer does not respond .

47:47.965 --> 47:50.101
Admiral
Megalodon is gone .

47:50.102 --> 47:51.943
I am not getting read .

47:58.661 --> 48:00.817
Lord , is Dr. MacNeil .

48:02.365 --> 48:03.696
Dr. MacNeil ...

48:03.697 --> 48:06.654
<i> found something you
really need to see . </i>

48:07.668 --> 48:09.883
The sooner the better as ,
Admiral .

48:10.744 --> 48:13.144
Can make all the difference .

48:23.723 --> 48:26.012
What are you looking at?
I threw it away .

48:26.013 --> 48:27.719
I'm looking at you ,
dear .

48:27.720 --> 48:29.173
Yes , yes .

48:29.586 --> 48:31.349
This fit to travel?

48:34.163 --> 48:35.566
Maybe , why?

48:35.567 --> 48:38.113
Emma MacNeil wants to see you .

48:39.974 --> 48:42.139
I'm free .
- Good .

48:42.140 --> 48:43.981
I'll prepare the helicopter.

48:57.049 --> 49:00.532
SITE EMMA MACNEIL ,
NEW ZEALAND

49:01.734 --> 49:03.874
Dr. Grey , thank you
for coming .

49:03.875 --> 49:05.432
Dr. MacNeil , is a pleasure .

49:05.433 --> 49:07.872
Engleberg said he has something
to show me .

49:07.873 --> 49:09.289
In fact , I have .

49:09.988 --> 49:13.112
To be simple ,
I managed to track down the Mega ...

49:13.113 --> 49:15.226
and I think I know exactly
where he is going.

49:15.227 --> 49:17.219
Thought TGE
was out of the question.

49:17.220 --> 49:20.808
Geospatial technology was
out of the question , yes it is true .

49:20.809 --> 49:22.834
because of the depth
the Mega nothing

49:22.835 --> 49:24.643
could not
scan the ground

49:24.644 --> 49:26.193
without seeing the floor .

49:26.194 --> 49:28.553
But I noticed something
corresponding

49:28.554 --> 49:30.401
exactly with the trace
Megalodon .

49:30.402 --> 49:31.758
Really?

49:31.759 --> 49:35.145
The dots indicate
Megalodon sightings .

49:35.146 --> 49:37.903
Now
has something unique in its pattern.

49:37.904 --> 49:40.019
sharks generally
like ...

49:40.020 --> 49:42.940
rotating an area
and stay for a while .

49:43.247 --> 49:44.964
This path shows us

49:44.965 --> 49:47.263
our Megalodon
is moving fast .

49:47.264 --> 49:48.714
A downward curve .

49:48.715 --> 49:50.284
This pattern is unique
so ...

49:50.285 --> 49:51.891
I was a little curious ...

49:51.892 --> 49:53.830
and the temperature sobrepus
water

49:53.831 --> 49:55.409
with the ocean currents ...

49:55.410 --> 49:56.823
and found that ...

49:56.824 --> 49:58.211
Our shark is moving

49:58.212 --> 50:01.087
in a warm ocean current
originated in the Mediterranean ...

50:01.088 --> 50:02.724
which appeared
first.

50:02.725 --> 50:05.115
The trail hits
with sightings .

50:05.116 --> 50:07.728
Now, I believe
the shark

50:07.729 --> 50:09.896
will
this stream of hot water

50:09.897 --> 50:12.131
because he is going
forth .

50:12.447 --> 50:13.936
Sydney ?

50:14.290 --> 50:16.412
There are two million years

50:16.413 --> 50:18.804
this territory was
Reproduction of Megalodon .

50:18.805 --> 50:20.487
How do you know ?

50:20.488 --> 50:22.960
A researcher from fossil
confirmed .

50:22.961 --> 50:25.355
We found literally

50:25.356 --> 50:27.487
million teeth of puppies
Megalodon

50:27.488 --> 50:29.573
scattered in a radius of 16km .

50:30.046 --> 50:32.072
Furthermore, the Megalodon

50:32.073 --> 50:34.733
probably born here ,
making this an essential point

50:34.734 --> 50:36.455
for him to return .

50:36.456 --> 50:39.219
So it is
1.5 km from Sydney ?

50:39.220 --> 50:40.520
Yes.

50:40.521 --> 50:43.035
It's the closest
who came from the coast

50:43.036 --> 50:45.273
since the attack
the Port of Alexandria.

50:45.274 --> 50:46.643
If I were you ...

50:47.052 --> 50:49.448
concentrate all I have

50:49.449 --> 50:51.615
waters of Sydney
because

50:51.616 --> 50:55.576
if the Megalodon get there and
not find a partner ...

50:55.577 --> 50:57.382
He is not happy .

50:57.383 --> 50:59.547
No.

51:27.254 --> 51:29.185
<i> Given the scale of evacuation </i>

51:29.186 --> 51:31.634
how prepared you
is to deal with so many people ?

51:31.635 --> 51:35.557
We are prepared and trained
for all types of situations.

51:35.558 --> 51:38.688
Are you saying that the preparation
for this evacuation is

51:38.689 --> 51:42.661
similar to the preparation for a
evacuation after a major earthquake ?

51:42.662 --> 51:45.471
Exact. But in this case , if
people remain calm,

51:45.472 --> 51:47.400
we can evacuate all
to a safe location ,

51:47.401 --> 51:49.068
before the disaster occurs.

51:49.069 --> 51:50.865
Thank you, Sergeant Brooks .

51:51.558 --> 51:53.359
Back in the studio .

51:53.360 --> 51:55.223
And we're off .

51:56.402 --> 51:57.919
Thank God !

51:57.920 --> 51:59.445
But that piece of shit .

51:59.446 --> 52:03.687
If you are evacuating the entire city ,
should know who is coming here .

52:03.688 --> 52:05.494
It is to keep
everything under control .

52:05.495 --> 52:07.962
It could get ugly
very fast .

52:20.174 --> 52:22.229
So tell me doctor ...

52:22.230 --> 52:26.443
have a killer fish
worth billions of dollars dead ?

52:26.444 --> 52:28.380
No.

52:29.359 --> 52:30.993
<i> is not dead . </i>

52:31.772 --> 52:33.988
<i> only need to recharge energy. </i>

52:35.187 --> 52:38.596
But is not making
what he should do .

52:51.707 --> 52:53.120
Right.

52:53.558 --> 52:54.949
What did he do ?

52:55.867 --> 52:59.040
<i> Jack ?
Jack ? </I></i>

52:59.041 --> 53:01.605
Nero, what happened , buddy ?
We lost .

53:01.606 --> 53:05.582
<i> I'm in control now . </i>
All right , but what happened?

53:06.178 --> 53:07.921
Not sure <i> . </i>

53:07.922 --> 53:10.508
I'm not used <i>
with the system or circuit . </i>

53:10.509 --> 53:13.051
Nero ...
Write a diagnosis .

53:13.052 --> 53:14.635
Overall sequence .

53:16.494 --> 53:17.862
Nero?

53:17.863 --> 53:20.020
<i> Say the magic word ,
Jack . </I></i>

53:21.114 --> 53:23.555
- Please .
<i> Certainly , Jack . </i>

53:24.771 --> 53:26.122
Lord ...

53:26.123 --> 53:27.667
Is Dr. Grey .

53:27.668 --> 53:30.641
Dr. Grey , that was quick .
What?

53:30.642 --> 53:33.957
Admiral , Dr. MacNeil said
he's going to Australia .

53:33.958 --> 53:36.423
Australia ?
Confirm this 100% ?

53:36.424 --> 53:38.275
Yes sir, I'm going
there now .

53:38.276 --> 53:40.021
Sure , someone will
you find there .

53:40.022 --> 53:41.429
He can help us .

53:41.430 --> 53:43.105
The meeting point will be there.

53:43.106 --> 53:44.753
Can by Jack on the phone ?

53:52.294 --> 53:53.594
Hi , dear .

53:54.055 --> 53:55.465
I heard right?

53:55.466 --> 53:57.404
You are going straight
to the port of Sydney .

53:58.349 --> 54:00.698
Look, I know you
is busy ...

54:00.699 --> 54:03.425
- just make sure that ...
- I'll be fine , Jack .

54:03.426 --> 54:06.215
Will .
Love you .

54:07.165 --> 54:08.465
I love you too .

54:14.586 --> 54:15.886
Lord .

54:16.336 --> 54:17.771
This just came .

54:19.248 --> 54:21.136
To realign these
coordinates.

54:21.137 --> 54:22.834
Full - speed .
Yes, sir .

54:23.396 --> 54:24.705
What?

54:24.706 --> 54:26.225
His wife succeeded .

54:26.226 --> 54:28.542
We are going to Australia .
How is Nero ?

54:28.543 --> 54:30.899
<i> I'm operating ,
Admiral . </I></i>

54:30.900 --> 54:32.752
Yes ,
all systems are fine.

54:32.753 --> 54:34.380
Has a flaw somewhere,

54:34.381 --> 54:37.017
but no time to tinker
on the motherboard and find out what it is.

54:37.018 --> 54:39.756
You are right .
Nero, going to Australia .

54:39.757 --> 54:41.525
Are sending the coordinates .

54:41.526 --> 54:44.188
<i> Understood , Admiral . </i>
- The game is tied , Jack .

54:48.057 --> 54:49.357
You what?

54:57.404 --> 55:00.892
<i> Come on.
Come on. </I></i>

55:09.256 --> 55:11.186
- Dr. Grey.
How are you ?

55:11.596 --> 55:14.896
I was assigned to find him .
I am General Hogan .

55:14.897 --> 55:16.804
How is the procedure
evacuation ?

55:16.805 --> 55:20.080
It's been three hours , is difficult.
But do our best .

55:20.081 --> 55:22.008
We know when the Megalodon
be here ?

55:22.009 --> 55:24.446
We're not sure .
But we know it is near .

55:24.447 --> 55:27.131
To be cautious ,
we have to keep moving quickly .

55:27.132 --> 55:29.247
I agree , I have a car
waiting for you

55:29.248 --> 55:31.032
to take it up there.

55:31.033 --> 55:32.642
Thank you.
Right this way .

55:44.382 --> 55:46.061
Friend, where are we going ?

55:46.062 --> 55:48.855
- For the interior , sir .
Why? What's going on ?

55:48.856 --> 55:52.236
We're not sure , just asked
to evacuate all coastal .

55:52.237 --> 55:53.721
Keep moving .

56:13.932 --> 56:16.560
Lord ,
Megalodon is emerging .

56:16.561 --> 56:18.814
Nero ...
take care of it .

56:20.055 --> 56:21.985
- Please .
<i> Yes , Jack . </i>

56:24.740 --> 56:28.318
Miss , I need help.
I can not find my daughter .

56:28.319 --> 56:33.046
How is she ?
It has 1.40 - m . blonde , like me.

56:33.047 --> 56:37.126
You're in jeans and a pink blouse.
How old are you ?

56:37.127 --> 56:38.517
- Has six years
Right.

56:38.518 --> 56:40.696
Can not have gone far ,
we seek help .

56:40.697 --> 56:42.146
What if ...
Let's find her .

56:42.147 --> 56:44.703
Seen a little girl ?
That time , 6 years ...

56:44.704 --> 56:46.904
- His name is Stacey .
Sorry , did not see her .

56:46.905 --> 56:48.691
Take care ,
I'll try here .

56:49.827 --> 56:52.152
Have you seen a little girl?
We're evacuating !

56:52.153 --> 56:53.936
- We leave in 5 minutes!
All right , look .

56:53.937 --> 56:56.326
I will not go without it !
But , lady ...

56:57.517 --> 56:58.953
Stacey ?

57:07.165 --> 57:08.474
Stacey ?

57:09.642 --> 57:11.780
Her mother is looking for you .

57:13.767 --> 57:15.085
You'll be fine .

57:44.847 --> 57:47.197
<i> Jack , something's wrong. </i>

57:47.198 --> 57:50.792
I see flaws everywhere ,
you are ...

58:04.540 --> 58:05.934
Stacey !

58:24.349 --> 58:26.326
You can not stay here .
I know, I know .

58:26.327 --> 58:28.655
I'm looking for someone .
- I have strict orders .

58:28.656 --> 58:31.099
I'm in the Navy ,
look for a little girl ...

58:31.100 --> 58:32.455
Have you seen her ?

58:32.456 --> 58:33.874
I just saw you , lady .

58:33.875 --> 58:35.975
I'm fine , go ahead.
I can not let her ...

58:35.976 --> 58:38.513
I've got orders to ...
- Look, I know what your orders are .

58:38.915 --> 58:40.818
I do not have time to talk .

58:44.597 --> 58:46.040
Let her go .

58:51.620 --> 58:54.952
So there is no chance
him back to the sea ?

58:54.953 --> 58:58.274
No
afraid he would go to the end .

58:58.275 --> 59:01.112
Listen , he knows the area and ...

59:01.113 --> 59:03.353
do not think it will go away
without a partner .

59:03.354 --> 59:06.421
It is a feature of Mega
I'm just saying that .

59:06.422 --> 59:08.492
So you're saying we

59:08.493 --> 59:11.740
a shark 60m needed
in our hands ?

59:12.134 --> 59:13.591
Yes , basically.

59:13.592 --> 59:16.015
Well, on the one hand
is a good thing .

59:16.016 --> 59:18.609
If we take
to a closed area ...

59:18.610 --> 59:20.719
we can finish the job .

59:20.720 --> 59:22.100
No, listen .

59:22.101 --> 59:25.688
Do not have much time , right?
What I'm trying to say is that

59:25.689 --> 59:28.327
if you do not find a girlfriend
this guy soon ...

59:28.328 --> 59:31.981
have a very aggressive beast
in his hands .

59:33.717 --> 59:35.601
Thank you, Dr.

59:40.828 --> 59:42.229
Nero?

59:42.230 --> 59:45.354
- Come on , buddy .
- What now ?

59:45.355 --> 59:49.335
There was a lot of damage ,
I lost all communications .

59:49.336 --> 59:50.921
I'll try to fix it.

59:51.822 --> 59:53.558
ROBOT MODE ACTIVATED

59:53.559 --> 59:54.907
No, it's too late.

59:54.908 --> 59:57.018
You do not know , it's worth trying .
It's too late.

59:57.019 --> 59:59.306
Mecha is entering
in robot mode.

01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:02.179
What do you mean ?

01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:04.784
What is the robot mode ?

01:00:05.626 --> 01:00:07.054
What does this mean ?

01:00:07.055 --> 01:00:09.738
The program has a security
against failure .

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.915
The program allows survival
operating alone as a Robot .

01:00:12.916 --> 01:00:15.551
As a self-guided torpedo.

01:00:15.552 --> 01:00:18.404
Unfortunately ,
the program is active .

01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:21.458
Will do what you gotta do
without safety protocols .

01:00:22.288 --> 01:00:24.381
I can not turn it off .

01:00:33.055 --> 01:00:35.530
My goodness!

01:00:39.848 --> 01:00:41.943
This is not good.

01:00:41.944 --> 01:00:44.055
Come on, something to work !

01:00:44.817 --> 01:00:46.228
Come on!

01:00:49.086 --> 01:00:50.574
I'm going outside .

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.450
Come on.

01:01:22.771 --> 01:01:24.496
Let's stop it .

01:01:48.382 --> 01:01:50.175
Move it , move it!

01:01:50.176 --> 01:01:51.801
U.S. Navy !

01:01:51.802 --> 01:01:53.564
Sorry sir,
this area is prohibited .

01:01:53.565 --> 01:01:56.459
- Not for me .
I'm authorized to use force.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.492
Truth ?
Go ahead .

01:01:58.493 --> 01:02:00.038
Use the force .

01:02:02.826 --> 01:02:04.736
Are you
the U.S. Navy ?

01:02:04.737 --> 01:02:06.153
I am .

01:02:06.154 --> 01:02:07.633
Have identification ?

01:02:07.634 --> 01:02:11.287
I got a giant robot shark.
I guess you did not see .

01:02:11.288 --> 01:02:13.226
I left my wallet
at home this morning .

01:02:13.227 --> 01:02:17.841
If not let me pass ,
have a long , long day , friend .

01:02:20.085 --> 01:02:21.385
Very well .

01:02:24.133 --> 01:02:25.508
Thank you.

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:27.249
Move it , move it!

01:02:27.846 --> 01:02:29.981
Let's continue !

01:02:29.982 --> 01:02:31.302
Keep !

01:02:32.677 --> 01:02:34.534
- Jack !
I'm sorry , buddy .

01:02:36.948 --> 01:02:39.191
What happened ?
It's okay .

01:02:49.896 --> 01:02:51.668
Nero is not responding .

01:02:51.669 --> 01:02:53.074
So off?

01:02:53.075 --> 01:02:56.048
No, you're thinking.

01:02:56.664 --> 01:02:58.015
Thinking ?

01:02:59.661 --> 01:03:01.384
AMPHIBIOUS MODE ACTIVATED

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.787
It was the Shutdown button .
Why not work?

01:03:29.982 --> 01:03:31.645
Contact President .

01:03:39.152 --> 01:03:40.973
What the hell is this?

01:03:40.974 --> 01:03:43.939
Had time to deploy
an amphibious mode.

01:03:58.667 --> 01:04:00.141
<i> is she </i>

01:04:09.453 --> 01:04:10.867

01:04:16.134 --> 01:04:17.634

01:04:18.649 --> 01:04:20.810
Nero, you hear?

01:04:20.811 --> 01:04:22.840
Nero , disarm yourself !

01:04:22.841 --> 01:04:25.357
He can see that they are human ?
- The protocol was already .

01:04:25.358 --> 01:04:27.043
There is nothing
we can do.

01:04:29.572 --> 01:04:32.559
The President will
my resignation the morning ...

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.980
but now ,
we have a job to do .

01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:53.677
Excuse me .
Excuse me .

01:04:53.678 --> 01:04:57.082
What Nero is doing ?
- Nero Nero is no more .

01:05:06.804 --> 01:05:08.265
Jack !

01:05:11.577 --> 01:05:13.538
Rosie ! Rosie !

01:05:13.959 --> 01:05:15.630
<i> I'll be back ! </i>

01:05:18.403 --> 01:05:19.791
It will be okay .

01:05:33.493 --> 01:05:34.837
Get in!

01:05:35.188 --> 01:05:36.651
That's my girl.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:42.160
Okay , go .

01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:50.526
Go, go, go .

01:05:50.527 --> 01:05:51.838
Put the belt .

01:05:53.754 --> 01:05:55.385
Pisa background, dear .

01:06:05.917 --> 01:06:07.938
Where are we going ?
- For the city .

01:06:07.939 --> 01:06:09.429
What?

01:06:29.409 --> 01:06:32.358
- Have you ever seen anything like this before ?
No, never .

01:06:36.394 --> 01:06:37.772
Do not move.

01:06:38.797 --> 01:06:40.657
Turn on the camera .

01:06:45.017 --> 01:06:46.455
Dave ...

01:06:46.456 --> 01:06:47.827
Dave , lower the camera.

01:06:51.218 --> 01:06:53.137
Come on, quick !

01:06:59.809 --> 01:07:01.911
Holy shit !

01:07:36.873 --> 01:07:38.814
We need to return
and try to fix.

01:07:41.048 --> 01:07:43.108
- Hello?
<i> - Dr. Grey, who find it good . </I></i>

01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:44.495
<i> you okay ? </i>

01:07:44.496 --> 01:07:46.352
I'm fine, thanks.

01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:48.514
<i> I got an urgent call
for you. </i>

01:07:48.515 --> 01:07:50.804
Okay, thank you .
Hello?

01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:52.420
<i> Rosie , there you are . </i>

01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:55.213
What is happening ?
I saw the news , is a zone .

01:07:55.214 --> 01:07:58.629
<i> Let's just say </i> that the Mecha
is no longer on our side .

01:07:59.017 --> 01:08:01.547
You know,
I think if you could ...

01:08:01.548 --> 01:08:04.972
take it back to the ocean and ...
My God , I do not know ...

01:08:04.973 --> 01:08:06.429
Alright .

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.777
The Mega is there to play ,
right?

01:08:08.778 --> 01:08:11.887
Then he will see any male
as a threat .

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:13.732
Right ...

01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:15.064
<i> Well, listen ... </i>

01:08:15.065 --> 01:08:17.390
I think if you can
lead to water mecha

01:08:17.392 --> 01:08:20.183
and find a way to annoy the Mega
throwing him against Mecha

01:08:20.184 --> 01:08:24.010
maybe you can use the Mega
to kill the Mecha .

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:28.310
If you can fool the Mega
to work for you

01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:30.037
have a chance .

01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:32.920
You know , use the instincts
Reproduction in his favor .

01:08:34.156 --> 01:08:35.533
I have an idea .

01:08:35.848 --> 01:08:37.416
Okay , good luck .

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:39.576

01:09:13.073 --> 01:09:15.139
Next time ...
I drive .

01:09:23.143 --> 01:09:25.216
- Mom !
Honey, where you been?

01:09:25.218 --> 01:09:26.800
Okay , guys .

01:09:30.184 --> 01:09:32.006

The Mecha still have torpedoes
left , Jack ?

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.865
Had a left pane ,
it was destroyed.

01:09:53.866 --> 01:09:56.157
Why?
- I have an idea .

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.588
What is ?

01:09:57.589 --> 01:09:59.003
Take this.

01:10:00.074 --> 01:10:01.646
What's this for ?

01:10:01.647 --> 01:10:03.189
I'll get it.

01:10:04.049 --> 01:10:06.453

High - frequency transmitters

Right.
Can I get ...

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:13.152
Enable the pulse generator
inside, it will be easy .

01:10:13.153 --> 01:10:14.516
Rosie , this is crazy !

01:10:14.517 --> 01:10:16.867
We have to put this shark
back in the water , Jack .

Rosie , are you listening ?

01:11:03.588 --> 01:11:05.182

<i> Okay , listen , honey .

<i> That's the plan . </i>

01:11:19.754 --> 01:11:22.577

01:11:59.797 --> 01:12:01.456

Be male , Jack !
Be macho!

Come and get me , big boy .

01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:08.758
Pilot, gotta go !

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:11.277
- See it myself .
Okay , sir .

01:13:27.257 --> 01:13:28.952
Come up here !

Got .

01:14:21.205 --> 01:14:23.463

Do not shoot !

01:15:38.948 --> 01:15:40.967
Honey , you gotta get out.

01:15:40.968 --> 01:15:42.776
I'm trapped in the tank .

<i> I'm not suing well . </i>

01:17:46.485 --> 01:17:48.910
<i> Something is wrong . </i>
It's because you are not you , friend .

01:17:48.911 --> 01:17:50.298
There is a flaw in the system .

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:52.692
<i> 'm not recording
a system crash , Jack . </i>

01:17:52.693 --> 01:17:56.144
This is because your system was
kidnapped by a Robot mode

01:17:56.145 --> 01:17:58.697
which declared that installed
in you .

01:17:58.698 --> 01:18:02.114
<i> So I 'm not
in control , Jack ? </i>

01:18:02.115 --> 01:18:04.813
No, Nero.
Listen , you can be .

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:08.357
Have to try to recover
control , the robot can deceive .

01:18:08.358 --> 01:18:10.061
<i> I understand . </i>

01:18:10.062 --> 01:18:12.765
Listen ,
the system will try to restart it ...

01:18:12.766 --> 01:18:15.309
but will not be able ,
because you are the source.

01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:18.575
All you need to do
is find out where centralized

01:18:18.576 --> 01:18:21.165
and you can get rid of it .
<i> - Locating ... </i>

01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:22.915
Fast, please.

01:18:27.851 --> 01:18:30.495
<i> I'm in control , Jack . </i>

01:18:30.496 --> 01:18:33.362
Listen , Nero.
Rosie is in danger .

01:18:33.363 --> 01:18:36.883

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.315
Good job , buddy .

01:18:54.656 --> 01:18:56.333
You did not win .

01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:28.544
Gotcha !

01:20:08.814 --> 01:20:10.672
Why did it take so long?

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:12.115
Was walking .

Do not think it survived .

01:20:46.218 --> 01:20:47.932
What about you ?

01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:51.040
- How are you?

01:20:54.171 --> 01:20:57.588
Not sure if this will make
best things , but ...

destroyed.

is plug and he will be back.

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:36.827
be concerned
with it later .

01:21:37.183 --> 01:21:39.377
