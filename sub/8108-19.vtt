00:37.247 --> 00:39.916
Blunt force trauma to the head did
the fatal damage.

What's wrong with my legs?

My heart? Oh, God.
They don't know I'm in here.

01:03.732 --> 01:08.069
HOUSE: Hey, genius. I think it violates
certain ethical laws

01:08.278 --> 01:10.447
to rip the organs out of a guy
that's still alive.

01:10.697 --> 01:12.157
Possibly certain law laws, too.

Could you get back
in your bed, please, Mr. House?

01:17.704 --> 01:18.663
LEE: This guy's a doctor?

01:18.788 --> 01:20.749
There's also
a Navy SEAL House,

01:20.874 --> 01:22.125
but you're gonna
have to save up for that one.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.544
Really? Well,
that's interesting,

01:24.669 --> 01:26.129
but you're here because
you crashed your motorcycle,

not because I need
a consult, so get back in bed.

So drop it.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.433
HOUSE: See that?

don't mean he's alive.

No. That's just the amplifier's

his eye following you?

01:57.160 --> 01:57.994
LEE: Exactly.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.079
Following motion is
an involuntary reflex.

LEE: No.

these things.

Hit the brake. Hit the brake.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.050
You sustained a traumatic injury
to your brain stem,

stuck like this.

the brain damage.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.696
Maybe the brain
damage caused the crash.

Why couldn't I stop?

Stroke, cancer,

04:19.093 --> 04:22.764
even a simple infection, anything that
insults the central pons could do this.

I could be fixed.

him false hope.

are basilar artery stroke

gonna be the last thing I ate?

Excuse Dr. Kutner. He gets a little
excited about new technology.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.317
It can get loud in there,
and a little closed off.

relaxing scenario?

07:42.922 --> 07:44.215
I guess you like me.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.844
Either that or
you got sent here.

07:47.969 --> 07:49.720
What, by God?

07:49.846 --> 07:52.390
I'm not sure if
I believe in God.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.643
You spend an awful lot of time in church
for someone who doesn't.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.230
I don't not
believe either.

08:00.106 --> 08:02.316
It's either one
or the other.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.194
I go to church mainly to
keep my wife happy, but...

08:06.821 --> 08:08.114
I don't know.
I've never actually thought that

08:08.239 --> 08:10.700
God could reach out
and affect my life.

08:10.825 --> 08:15.663
But getting a brilliant
doctor in the bed next to me...

08:15.788 --> 08:19.709
God is also the guy who opened his car
door in front of you.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.210
I think
Molly was right.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.005
I think you were sent here
to make me get better.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.465
I think so.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.203
And my new room
doesn't have you.

08:56.621 --> 09:00.208
Your MRI showed
a lesion in the central pons.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.001
LEE: What is that?
What does that mean?

09:02.126 --> 09:03.169
See it there?

09:03.294 --> 09:04.128
LEE: No.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.090
Yeah, that's
what they said.

09:09.217 --> 09:13.262
But it's there, which means no way
head trauma did this.

09:13.679 --> 09:17.475
It's cancer, causing a
paraneoplastic syndrome.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.685
Unfortunately, your
current doctor thinks

09:19.810 --> 09:22.813
its diffused nature
means an infection.

09:22.939 --> 09:25.608
Now, the bad news
is the antivirals

09:25.733 --> 09:28.653
he's got you on
might kill you.

09:28.778 --> 09:29.737
LEE: I'm not gonna die.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.282
The good news is,
if they just almost kill you,

09:33.407 --> 09:37.578
then Dr. Idiot will realize that
his name is not a coincidence,

09:37.703 --> 09:39.497
and he'll let me
do whatever I want.

09:39.622 --> 09:40.539
LEE: Thank you.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.836
See, the irony here is,

09:47.588 --> 09:49.298
you're kind of fascinating.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.385
So many questions.

09:53.261 --> 09:54.929
But if you could
answer any of them,

09:55.054 --> 09:56.597
then you wouldn't
be fascinating.

nuts, aren't you?

Your wife is the one
getting you through this.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.733
Your wife and me.

10:09.694 --> 10:12.238
Although, frankly, the MRI
was a lot more useful

10:12.363 --> 10:14.365
than four hours of hand holding.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.326
I think.

10:18.411 --> 10:20.538

he'd know it matters.

You're a good guy.
Easy to talk to.

help in here.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.551
Your patient is seizing.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.722
Why would
he have a seizure?

10:37.847 --> 10:39.265
HOUSE: Because he has cancer.

10:39.390 --> 10:40.558
His brain stem is compromised.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.227
LEE: Why are you still arguing with
this guy? You thought I was dead.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.563
Welcome back.
And nicely played.

10:45.688 --> 10:49.483
You almost died,
exactly as we planned.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.901
You knew this
was gonna happen?

10:51.027 --> 10:54.572
Usually happens when you treat cancer
by pretending it's not cancer.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.450

- It's cancer?

10:57.575 --> 10:58.534

11:01.871 --> 11:04.665

- Can you give that to him?

11:04.790 --> 11:06.834
No, no, I'm sorry. I completely disagree
with Dr. House.

LEE: Please shut up!

11:08.044 --> 11:09.211
I don't.

11:09.337 --> 11:11.464
Which means
I can treat him.

LEE: I can't move, and she's worried
about his boo-boo?

11:41.577 --> 11:43.037
What were you
doing up there anyway?

11:43.162 --> 11:44.580
Antiquing.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.415
Found you a late
Victorian corset.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.833
Come by later.
I'll tie you up.

11:47.958 --> 11:52.046
LEE: He hitting on her? If she turns
around, she's into him, too.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.381
And there you have it.

11:53.506 --> 11:55.549
Sorry, I didn't show up
in Middletown. I didn't get the message.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.510
Probably 'cause
there was no message.

11:57.635 --> 12:00.096
I decided to accept
your resignation.

12:00.221 --> 12:02.681
Uh, I thought we were past this.
I decided to stay.

12:02.807 --> 12:04.725
HOUSE: No, you didn't, you had it
decided for you.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.310
So now you're stuck here
with a boss

12:06.435 --> 12:08.312
who knows that you wanna be
somewhere else.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.314
Which means you're
no longer motivated to impress me.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.359
Which means you're no longer motivated
to come up with good ideas.

12:13.484 --> 12:14.902
Unless I'm wrong.

12:15.653 --> 12:18.864
Save the cheerleader,
save your world.

12:20.157 --> 12:20.991
I got it from here.

12:21.117 --> 12:22.493
LEE: I thought you
already solved this.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.912
You thinking you might be wrong?

12:25.037 --> 12:26.539
What's going on?

12:26.664 --> 12:29.583
Hey, just curious.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.877
What're you driving
up to Middletown for?

12:32.002 --> 12:32.837
Why do you care?

12:32.962 --> 12:33.921
LEE: Why does he care?

12:34.046 --> 12:35.423
Because I'm your friend.

12:35.548 --> 12:37.591
- I was buying a guitar.
- Yeah. I heard that.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.970
Used to belong to a guitarist who died
in a motorcycle accident.

12:41.095 --> 12:43.681
Just reeks of you
screwing with people.

12:43.806 --> 12:48.227
Your crash was 10 miles from the Orange
County Progressive Pain Clinic.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.396
You live 10 miles
from Mary's Dress Shop.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.231
And yet,
that's not even on my list of reasons

12:52.356 --> 12:54.316
that I think you're
secretly a transvestite.

12:54.442 --> 12:58.237
If you're going to another state
to get more narcotics...

12:58.362 --> 12:59.196
LEE: He's on drugs?

12:59.321 --> 13:02.158
I went to visit your ex-ex-ex wife
who lives in Thompson Ridge.

13:02.283 --> 13:04.827
Let her know about the extra money
you're making on the lecture circuit,

13:04.952 --> 13:07.288
so she'll be sure
to adjust your alimony.

13:07.413 --> 13:08.664
You wouldn't do that.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.416
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.667
Would you?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.127
LEE: You guys
are friends?

13:16.964 --> 13:19.425
Shouldn't we be entertaining
our patient?

13:19.550 --> 13:23.429
I performed Euripides with sock puppets,
you just missed it.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.306
House said we should.

13:25.431 --> 13:26.724
The mind is like a muscle.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.852
If you don't exercise it,
it'll atrophy, just like anything else.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.105
Whoever's with him needs to talk,
keep his mind active.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.150
And it'll show
House you still care.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.443
Not sure if I do.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.236
LEE: Jeez,
you're my doctor.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.613
KUTNER: Then why
don't you just quit?

13:40.738 --> 13:42.406
- Not sure I want to do that, either.
- Oh.

13:43.741 --> 13:46.619
Maybe you should figure it out before
House figures it out for you.

13:46.744 --> 13:50.706
LEE: Dude, maybe you should have your
midlife crisis after I'm better.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.249
Kutner.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.544
We'll be right back.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.547
LEE: Wait. Wait,
what did you just see?

14:04.678 --> 14:06.013
Do you drink?

14:06.138 --> 14:09.058

proves your theory.

Is it fixable? What does that mean?

14:15.397 --> 14:16.232
That hurts.

14:16.357 --> 14:17.858

14:17.983 --> 14:19.818
How much do you drink?
A six-pack a day?

14:19.944 --> 14:21.362
LEE: I hate beer.
I don't even drink beer.

14:21.487 --> 14:22.404
Could mean he drinks
more or less,

14:22.530 --> 14:23.489
or maybe something else.

14:23.614 --> 14:24.865
KUTNER: It may not
be alcohol at all.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.367
Street opiates could
also cause locked-in...

14:26.492 --> 14:27.326
LEE: I don't get high.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.163
Either we play 20,000 questions
with every street drug,

14:31.288 --> 14:34.458
or instead of talking
to him, we talk to the lesion.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.417
LEE: Talk to me.

14:35.543 --> 14:38.295

biopsy the brain stem?

14:38.420 --> 14:41.340
For the record, that doesn't count
as your inspired idea.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.508
It's sort of
where I was heading.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.427
LEE: You're gonna cut
into my head? Why?

14:46.387 --> 14:48.430
Stop treating me like
a piece of furniture!

14:48.556 --> 14:50.516
I have a right to
know what's going on!

14:56.188 --> 14:57.606
Where is that going?

14:57.731 --> 15:00.150
Blood in your urine clogged up
your old catheter.

15:00.276 --> 15:04.071
LEE: Peeing blood? That must be
what the insecure doctor saw.

15:04.196 --> 15:07.116
Every clue gets us
closer to the answer.

15:08.284 --> 15:09.118
LEE: Damn it!

15:09.243 --> 15:11.370
The surgery will
get us more clues.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.587
You have visitors.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.926
LEE: No. No, Molly.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.344
You can come in now.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.555
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.348
LEE: I told you
not to bring them.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.350
They wanted to
see their father.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.396
LEE: I can't
even hug them.

15:37.521 --> 15:40.190
They can handle it.
It's gonna be all right.

15:40.316 --> 15:42.651
LEE: You're not so sure
anymore, are you?

15:42.776 --> 15:46.905
They must have told you that
it's dangerous, that I could die.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.283
And that's why you
brought them in here.

15:49.408 --> 15:50.826
I got an A plus
on my test.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.870
LEE: To see me
before I die.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.038
I love you, Daddy.

15:54.163 --> 15:55.539
LEE: Daddy loves you, too.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.542
I want to show
my drawings.

15:58.667 --> 16:03.547
LEE: Kids just want a dad.
Even if he's just a lump.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.966
Maybe you should go now.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.053
LEE: Oh no, they can stay.
Please, let them stay.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.347
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

16:12.389 --> 16:13.766

16:23.233 --> 16:26.236
Sorry. You were crying.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.697
LEE: Damn.

16:35.829 --> 16:39.083
We're going to put you out,
just so we can drill the hole.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.002
LEE: Oh, that's very
thoughtful of you.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.755
Then we'll wake
you back up.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.591
We need you to answer some simple
"yes" or "no" questions

16:47.716 --> 16:48.717
while we're cutting
to make sure

16:48.842 --> 16:49.677
we're not cutting where we shouldn't.

16:49.802 --> 16:50.761
LEE: Seems to be working.

16:50.886 --> 16:55.683
Deep breaths. In about 10 seconds,
you will feel light headed.

16:56.767 --> 17:00.104
By now, you should

How come I'm not better?

17:21.250 --> 17:24.002
God's not supposed to
work in trial and error.

17:24.128 --> 17:26.255
God's mistakes
are well documented.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.881
If he'd done everything
right the first time,

17:28.006 --> 17:30.634
there'd have been one plague
and zero great floods.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.803
Those were because
of human mistakes.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.180
You think your doctor
has an apartment on Mount Olympus?

17:35.347 --> 17:37.266
God put me with
you for a reason.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.143
I'm gonna be all
right still, right?

17:41.353 --> 17:42.604
I don't know.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.696
Lee?
You with me now?

17:54.241 --> 17:56.118
Easy questions.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.787
You'll be done
before you know it.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.789
Is this equation correct?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.499
LEE: What? So if
you make a mistake,

18:02.624 --> 18:04.710
I'm not gonna
know that anymore?

18:04.835 --> 18:06.378
Are these lines
parallel?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.798
Spatial relationship's

at this circle.

Is more than
half of it shaded?

18:14.303 --> 18:15.679
LEE: Of course.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.600
Don't forget to blink. ls more than half
of the circle shaded?

18:19.725 --> 18:21.518
LEE: Sorry. Yes.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.895
Look at me, Lee.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.231
Again. ls more than half
of this circle shaded?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.358
Blink. Come on,
Lee. Blink.

18:28.484 --> 18:29.401
Foreman, back out.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.570

Cannot blink.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.411
MOLLY: Why aren't
his eyes moving?

18:41.038 --> 18:44.124
HOUSE: Two options, my
neurologist screwed up,

18:44.249 --> 18:46.376
or else something that
the hospital lawyer

18:46.502 --> 18:47.836
is going to have to come up with
when you sue us.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.046
FOREMAN: Blinking and eye movements

18:49.171 --> 18:51.048
are controlled
by a small cluster of nerves

18:51.173 --> 18:53.217
just millimeters
from the biopsy site.

18:54.051 --> 18:56.345
MOLLY: But he's still in there, right?
I mean, he just can't communicate?

18:56.470 --> 18:57.554
HOUSE: It's possible.

18:57.679 --> 19:01.058
Also possible is that the surgery caused
so much swelling in his brain stem

19:01.183 --> 19:02.351
that he's just gone.

19:03.977 --> 19:08.023
He had one way to communicate and now
that's gone. Well played.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.734
Brain biopsy revealed severe
damage to the myelin sheath.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.110
The question is why.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.947
Epstein Barr.
Picornaviruses. Malaria.

19:15.072 --> 19:18.325
He runs a business, meets a lot of
people, could have picked up rotavirus.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.077
Did he report
having bloody diarrhea?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.120
Wife's not sure.
Says he doesn't complain.

19:22.246 --> 19:23.080
Did you ask him?

19:23.205 --> 19:24.039
THIRTEEN: We prioritized.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.291
He can only blink, a real history
would've taken weeks.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.460
If he had Epstein-Barr,
he'd have belly pains.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.587
If he had picornavirus,
he'd have headaches.

19:30.712 --> 19:31.922
Five other
"yes/no" questions,

19:32.047 --> 19:34.007
and maybe we'd know
what treatment to give,

19:34.132 --> 19:35.926
and what treatment
would kill him.

19:36.385 --> 19:37.970
Unless he's already dead.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.265

Think "up" enough times, it eventually
learns what you're thinking.

Hmm.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.905
Either that or
he lied to you about it.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.823
People do that sometimes.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.368
For example, I just lied to him
about Missouri malaria.

You have to tell her I wasn't.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.489
Amazing.

A man who only has two blips
at his disposal can still lie.

in St. Louis in front of his wife.

then right into his lungs.

had a head trauma,

35:47.230 --> 35:49.941
(EKG ALARM BLARING)

35:50.525 --> 35:52.109
But you're about to be.

35:52.610 --> 35:53.653
LEE: Okay.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.074
Charging. Clear.

35:59.617 --> 36:01.118
Again. Clear.

36:01.911 --> 36:02.995
He's back.

36:03.120 --> 36:07.208
LEE: No. No. Let me go.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.626
LEE: You can't fix me.

36:08.751 --> 36:11.754
I've been here for three days.
Everything hurts.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.005
We need to get him
started on steroids.

36:13.130 --> 36:16.801
LEE: It's okay.
Just stop fighting.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.178
LEE: She's gotta go
on with her life.

36:21.639 --> 36:25.852
The kids don't need this.
I can't do nothing for them. I can't.

36:26.602 --> 36:30.898
God, this foot.
Oh, that really, really itches.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.900
So we put in a temporary pacer,
it's not gonna...

36:33.025 --> 36:34.193
Shut up! Shut up!

36:34.318 --> 36:37.071
(MACHINE BEEPING)

36:37.238 --> 36:38.614
He's trying to talk.

36:42.910 --> 36:44.245
Something bothering you?

36:45.955 --> 36:48.457
If there's still tightness
in your chest, it's expected.

36:48.583 --> 36:49.876
Is it your eye?

36:50.626 --> 36:53.504
(MACHINE BEEPS THREE TIMES)

36:53.629 --> 36:57.133
Why's he saying "no" three times?
You only asked one question.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.384
Maybe he's not
saying "no".

36:58.509 --> 37:00.219
Maybe he's
saying "down"?

37:05.349 --> 37:07.268
Are you saying that
the pain is lower?

37:07.727 --> 37:09.061
How low? Your leg?

37:09.770 --> 37:10.730
Your foot?

37:13.190 --> 37:14.567
Left foot?

37:14.942 --> 37:16.193
(MACHINE BEEPS "NO")

37:16.319 --> 37:19.488
Check his... Let me see now.
Yeah. His right foot.

37:19.614 --> 37:21.157
No bruises,
no rashes, no cuts.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.701
Then there should
be no pain.

37:23.826 --> 37:25.661
Is it a tingling
sensation?

37:26.829 --> 37:28.164
Is it itching?

37:28.289 --> 37:29.498
(MACHINE BEEPS "YES")

37:32.752 --> 37:35.630
Itchy foot means
liver failure.

37:35.755 --> 37:38.633
TAUB: The liver's fine, his enzymes have
been normal since we admitted him.

37:38.758 --> 37:40.551
I didn't say failing,
I said failure.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.094
Just like you.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.931
Liver's like a cruise
ship taking on water.

37:45.056 --> 37:46.891
As it starts to sink,
it sends out an SOS.

37:47.016 --> 37:49.644
Only instead of radio
waves, it uses enzymes.

37:49.769 --> 37:52.313
The more enzymes in
the blood, the worse the liver is.

37:52.438 --> 37:55.816
But once the ship has sunk,
there's no more SOS.

37:55.942 --> 37:58.945
You think the liver's fine, but it's
already at the bottom of the sea.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.529
So dying liver
released toxins,

38:00.655 --> 38:03.240
damaged the nerves,
led to locked-in syndrome.

38:03.366 --> 38:05.701
Now we just need to know what's causing
the liver failure.

38:05.826 --> 38:09.580
Liver plus eye plus kidney,
most likely sclerosing cholangitis.

38:09.705 --> 38:12.416
Oh, God, if only
Taub had said that,

38:12.541 --> 38:13.876
it would have
been a happy ending.

38:14.377 --> 38:15.628
Do a biopsy to confirm.

38:20.508 --> 38:24.136
I'm gonna numb up the area where
we'll go in for the punch biopsy.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.639
Where's the new bracelet?

38:27.890 --> 38:29.433
She was wearing
the bracelet?

38:29.558 --> 38:30.977
You didn't notice
that I was wearing it?

38:31.102 --> 38:32.103
Because you weren't.

38:32.228 --> 38:33.604
He noticed
and you didn't?

38:33.729 --> 38:35.564
If you don't like it,
it's fine, it's not a big deal.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.024
THIRTEEN: I like it.
That's the point.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.901
I'd rather have it at home
in the jewelry box

38:39.026 --> 38:41.112
than getting peed on at work.

38:41.237 --> 38:42.822
You got the patient's
urine on that arm?

38:42.947 --> 38:45.574
When I was putting
in the catheter. Why?

38:45.700 --> 38:48.452
- You've got a rash.
- The bracelet's real.

38:48.577 --> 38:51.580
I figured.
So what if the rash

38:51.706 --> 38:54.667
isn't just a rash,
what if it's an infection?

38:54.792 --> 38:57.211
If there were rats
in that basement,

38:57.336 --> 39:00.589
then the liver failure
could be caused by leptospirosis.

39:00.715 --> 39:04.135
Transfers through urine.
Rat pee to him. His pee to you.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.762
The infection would
need an entry point.

39:06.887 --> 39:09.265
Look for any recent
scratches, cuts.

39:13.686 --> 39:16.731
Look. Next to
his fingernail.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.736
The infection
destroyed your liver,

39:21.861 --> 39:25.031
which released toxins that caused
the locked-in syndrome.

39:25.281 --> 39:26.532
You were dying
of a paper cut.

39:26.949 --> 39:28.492
LEE: I hope
you're right this time.

39:28.659 --> 39:29.994
Let's start him on
high dose penicillin G.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.997
We found rats in your
buddy Dave's basement.

39:33.122 --> 39:35.416
Tested positive
for leptospirosis.

39:36.167 --> 39:37.960
Means we're on
the right treatment.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.715
So try moving
a finger.

39:44.842 --> 39:47.303
Your brain needs to get used
to doing its job again.

39:47.428 --> 39:48.721
Try harder.

39:50.973 --> 39:53.225
I'm sure you've lost hope.

39:54.602 --> 39:57.021
I know we've told you several times
that we knew what this was,

39:57.146 --> 39:59.065
but this time we're right.

40:00.441 --> 40:04.487
Concentrate. Move
one finger for me.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.749
Welcome back.

40:17.666 --> 40:18.584
(LEE LAUGHS)

40:18.709 --> 40:19.794
LEE: I did it.

40:27.384 --> 40:28.511
Rat pee.

40:29.553 --> 40:30.971
Very nice idea.

40:32.431 --> 40:33.557
Who came up with it?

40:34.517 --> 40:35.810
I did.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.231
Good.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.906
You okay with him
claiming the credit?

40:49.031 --> 40:51.367
It was his idea,
he saw the rash, he...

40:51.534 --> 40:53.369
If he did,
he would have hung

40:53.494 --> 40:56.413
a "Mission Accomplished"
banner in my outer office.

40:58.582 --> 41:00.251
Don't toy with him, if you're going
to fire him...

41:00.376 --> 41:03.879
Fact that he stole your
idea means that he cares enough to lie.

41:04.839 --> 41:06.590
That's all
I needed to know.

41:06.715 --> 41:10.177
Rat pee.
It's a very nice idea.

41:13.139 --> 41:16.433
House, you left
this in my office.

41:18.477 --> 41:20.020
No, I didn't.

41:20.396 --> 41:22.189
So either I have
a hole in my pocket...

41:22.314 --> 41:25.151
No, that's right.
I remember now. I stole it.

41:25.276 --> 41:27.987
Because if you had gone up there
to check out my girlfriend,

41:28.112 --> 41:29.947
you wouldn't have come
back here and lied to me about it.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.490
You would have thrown
her right in my face.

41:31.615 --> 41:34.118
You underestimate the
entertainment value of your obsessions.

41:34.243 --> 41:37.746
And then there were all those calls
you weren't taking in front of me.

41:40.249 --> 41:42.793
So I dialed the number of the calls
you weren't taking.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.587
You're seeing
a psychiatrist.

41:54.889 --> 41:57.474
You had no right to
invade my privacy.

41:59.226 --> 42:01.645
- Is that?
- Yeah, it's irony.

42:03.439 --> 42:04.607
Hey.

42:07.234 --> 42:10.613
God sent you.

42:12.364 --> 42:15.159
Suddenly, you're not
so fascinating.

42:18.370 --> 42:20.664
WILSON: You're spying
on your team?

42:20.789 --> 42:22.541
Prioritize, Wilson.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.835
Is that really what you want
to torture me about right now?

42:24.960 --> 42:26.170
I don't want to torture
you at all.

42:26.295 --> 42:27.463
I think
this is a great thing,

42:27.588 --> 42:30.674
not something you have to drive an hour
out of town to shroud in mystery.

42:30.799 --> 42:32.635
Yeah, whining on
someone's couch

42:32.760 --> 42:34.595
is an excellent
use of my time.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.722
Maybe I'll discover
that my childhood wasn't perfect.

42:36.847 --> 42:39.516
So your attitude
about therapy clearly hasn't changed.

42:39.642 --> 42:41.477
And yet you went.

42:41.602 --> 42:44.480
Which leads me to believe that maybe
something else has changed.

42:44.605 --> 42:48.359
Maybe you think you can change.
Credit Cuddy with that.

42:48.484 --> 42:51.320
Not much credit to
take 'cause I'm not going back.

42:51.445 --> 42:53.072
Oh, House, please.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.574
I assume you went
because you're tired of screwing up

42:55.699 --> 42:57.409
every chance you
get at happiness.

42:57.534 --> 42:58.535
Delete contact.

42:59.078 --> 43:01.121
Do not let the fact
that I found out about it...

43:01.247 --> 43:02.915
(SIGHS) Don't beat
yourself up.

43:03.165 --> 43:05.668
I'm not going back
because it doesn't work.

43:10.339 --> 43:11.674
You'll end up alone.
