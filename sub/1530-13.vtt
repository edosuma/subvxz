00:01.520 --> 00:03.921
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.000 --> 00:05.286
And an 084 is?

00:05.400 --> 00:07.209
An object of unknown origin.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.566
Skye's the 084?

00:08.640 --> 00:10.642
And who do you work for, Raina?
The Clairvoyant?

00:10.720 --> 00:12.768
The Clairvoyant gives us guidance.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.444
He has you
building super-soldiers.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.601
Mike's a good guy.

00:16.920 --> 00:17.921
Mike!

00:21.280 --> 00:22.327
No.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.164
Ian Quinn.
You've got to be kidding.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.971
This is Quinn's MO. He finds
young talent, and he takes advantage.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.767
We're on to you.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.360
Thank you, Agent Coulson.
I have a message for you.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.363
The Clairvoyant told me to say, "Hello."

00:47.120 --> 00:49.202
- Ian Quinn.
-You found him?

00:49.280 --> 00:51.282
No. But we think we know how we can.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.406
Skye tracked down an invoice
from one of his shell companies.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.528
He made a big purchase recently.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.726
$10 million big.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.643
- Any idea what it is?
- No clue.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.802
But it was designed and built
by Cybertek, Inc.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.042
A small firm that deals in advanced
technology and research.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.248
Which is where this gets interesting.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.085
They've hired a private security outfit
to transport the purchase.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.925
Former military. Ex-mercs.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.570
A lot of muscle to move one package.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.404
And they know S.H.l.E.L.D's
got eyes on Quinn.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.005
Which is why
they're transporting it old-school.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.765
On a train
through the Italian countryside.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.923
From Verona to Zagreb.
Very rural, very isolated.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.240
And you think Quinn's on that train?

01:26.320 --> 01:29.449
No, but I believe they're delivering
the item to Quinn himself.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.931
We got our Intel from Italian authorities

01:31.000 --> 01:32.490
who've been monitoring the situation.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.369
And they don't mind us
taking over the op?

01:34.440 --> 01:35.646
I asked very nicely.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.768
You're not asking me at all,
Agent Coulson.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.286
You're telling me and my team
to step aside.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.045
To hand over our investigation
to S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.966
Try to think of it less as a hand over
and more as a hand off.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.283
You've done your part.
Now we'll do ours.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.600
If everything goes as planned,

01:51.680 --> 01:53.967
Cybertek's security team
won't even know we were on the train.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.849
So we're going in undercover.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.601
I hate undercover.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.529
May and Ward,
you're front and center.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.246
Once we locate the package,
you'll tag it with a tracker.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.448
Skye and Fitz,
you'll be running communications.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.131
After the package is tagged,
we'll follow it to Quinn.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.645
Once we capture Quinn,

02:09.720 --> 02:11.802
we'll be one step closer
to The Clairvoyant.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.644
And what about the two of us, sir?

02:15.720 --> 02:16.801
Here, let me get that.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.521
Oh, thanks, Dad.

02:20.520 --> 02:23.922
Who looks far
too young to have a daughter my age.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.647
That looks cozy.

03:02.760 --> 03:04.364
Once I've located the package,

03:04.440 --> 03:07.171
I'll let you know
where to place the tracker.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.163
Seem like things are getting personal?

03:10.880 --> 03:14.043
- I'm talking about our operations.
-Ah.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.203
Look, I know Coulson
was put through hell, but...

03:17.280 --> 03:19.123
He hasn't been the same since.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.690
I don't know what he said to Skye,
but she's different.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.000
How so?

03:24.080 --> 03:25.889
Driven. Focused.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.645
She was holed up for days
trying to track down Quinn.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.291
It feels like Coulson's
got her on a warpath.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.885
- It seems personal.
-it is personal.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.486
The Clairvoyant had him tortured.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.723
Quinn's the only person we know
who's connected to all this.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.564
We both know personal urges

03:40.640 --> 03:44.008
can adversely affect tactical decisions.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.722
Hmm, that's why I don't have any.
You should do the same.

03:47.800 --> 03:48.801
Really?

03:48.880 --> 03:51.360
You think Coulson'll take that excuse
if he finds out about us?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.488
Took it okay when I told him.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.041
Wait. You told him?

03:58.120 --> 03:59.360
Yep.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.922
You nervous?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.402
Just ready for this all to be over.
Ready to get Quinn.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.005
Me, too.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.764
So are we British or American?

04:12.840 --> 04:14.808
- Does that matter?
-Well, we're traveling together.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.086
We should at least be
from the same country.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.491
How's your Scottish accent?

04:18.160 --> 04:19.366
I don't know.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.091
You tell me how great it is, laddie.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.082
American then. That's a better idea.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.531
Oh! That was really good.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.523
I used to watch a lot of
American TV growing up.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.204
Some of it's quite good.
Lots of nice teeth.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.328
Oh, here we go. Follow my lead.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.689
Excuse me. Do you speak English?

04:35.760 --> 04:38.206
Of course. How may I be of service?

04:38.280 --> 04:40.931
Can you recommend a restaurant
in downtown Zagreb?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.446
Someplace affordable.
With big portions.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.000
You are looking
for something romantic?

04:46.080 --> 04:47.809
Yes, please.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.291
Mmm-hmm!

04:49.360 --> 04:52.091
We are celebrating
our six-month anniversary

04:52.200 --> 04:54.089
with a whirlwind trip all over Europe.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.125
Well technically,
we met six months ago,

04:56.200 --> 04:57.964
but he didn't ask me out till last month.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.963
So our official one-month anniversary

05:00.040 --> 05:03.408
-isn't until next Saturday.
-Sunday. Saturday.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.482
I think he found me intimidating.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.410
Young love, so confusing.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.720
Is it?

05:14.400 --> 05:17.006
You got a little flustered back there.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.651
What, when you kissed me
on the cheek like my grandmother?

05:19.720 --> 05:23.327
Good going.
Really selling our relationship there.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.289
I have a device
that could've done those things.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.964
- Broken the lock and all that.
-What?

05:27.040 --> 05:28.530
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

05:28.640 --> 05:29.801
I'm always the gadget guy.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.201
Maybe sometimes I wanna
do things with my bare hands.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.408
You make the gadgets with your hands.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.171
Just allow me these rare moments
of self-pity, okay?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.925
You're the least supportive
pretend girlfriend I've ever had.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.089
Comms are live.
Coulson? Simmons? You in position?

05:44.160 --> 05:46.766
Yes. Just waiting on May's signal.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.844
So, remember. Our target is Carlo...

05:49.920 --> 05:53.447
Mancini. The head of security.
I know. I memorized his face.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.249
I memorized everything.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.486
What are you doing?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.050
Oh, I'm getting into character.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.565
My undercover persona

06:02.640 --> 06:05.405
harbors residual resentment
to her absent American father.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.211
Blames him for not being there
when her mum died.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.806
So I apologize in advance
if I come off a little cold.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.127
You think
all that backstory's necessary?

06:13.200 --> 06:16.727
Past events, like that
unfortunate incident at The Hub,

06:16.800 --> 06:19.201
have shown me that I'm not good
at improvisation.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.284
However, I excel at preparation.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.209
He's headed your way.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.890
You're on.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.927
All Mum ever wanted was your love.
To be with you.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.129
On our two-story Victorian home
in the Cotswolds.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.931
But could you even give her a moment?

06:36.040 --> 06:37.724
What with your banking job
requiring you

06:37.800 --> 06:39.723
to travel to the States

06:39.800 --> 06:41.928
from Tuesday to Saturday
every other week? No!

06:43.080 --> 06:47.324
I'm terribly sorry about your loss, dear.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.085
As for you.
Now is your chance to do better.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.844
Why don't you see that you take it!

06:53.920 --> 06:55.490
Thank you, sir.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.000
Let's go.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.926
He's right.
You never had any time for her.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.368
But you made time for your work.
And your prostitutes!

07:10.080 --> 07:11.081
Oh, God!

07:11.200 --> 07:13.168
Oh, no! Mum!

07:15.880 --> 07:17.291
Terribly sorry.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.049
Prostitutes? Plural?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.602
May, Coming your way.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.206
Copy that.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.850
Following the target to the package.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.363
Great. We see what you see.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.805
All right, May, Cybertek cases

07:36.880 --> 07:40.407
are usually lined with tungsten
polymer to prevent scanning.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.488
It should appear black on your infrared.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.366
Bingo.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.522
Eyes on the package,
fourth seat from the back.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.840
As we round the bend,

07:58.920 --> 08:02.163
the passengers on the north side
of the train can take in the views

08:02.240 --> 08:05.687
of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo.
Isn't it a wonder?

08:05.760 --> 08:07.649
Look at that.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.484
I haven't seen anything so beautiful

08:09.560 --> 08:11.164
since our family's scuba diving trip

08:11.240 --> 08:13.607
to the island of Koh Tao
in southeastern Thailand.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.610
Okay, Simmons, I appreciate
all your preparation, but...

08:16.680 --> 08:18.489
Don't you want to know
which marine life we encountered?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.684
Ward, are you in position?

08:23.160 --> 08:24.810
My comms are down.
Are yours working?

08:25.280 --> 08:26.884
Fitz? Skye?

08:27.640 --> 08:29.529
Something's wrong. Sit tight.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.241
I'm gonna go make sure
we don't lose that package.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.163
- Ward!
-We've been made!

09:00.480 --> 09:02.687
- Grenade! Coulson, we gotta jump!

09:28.680 --> 09:29.966
As we round the bend,

09:30.040 --> 09:33.283
the passengers on the north side
of the train can take in the views

09:33.360 --> 09:37.126
of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo.
Isn't it a wonder?

09:37.200 --> 09:38.884
May. Got the tracker.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.200
Headed to the dining car now
to tag the package.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.331
May? May?

10:38.400 --> 10:40.448
Cybertek knew we were here.

10:41.760 --> 10:42.841
Anyone copy?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.081
Damn it.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.165
We've been made. Comms are down.
Where's Coulson?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.844
He went to the dining car
to find the package.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.921
You've been hurt. Let me take a look.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.331
Not now. Go to the luggage car.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.640
Lock yourself in with Fitz and Skye.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.929
Don't come out until I get you.
I'm going to get Coulson.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.323
- Ward!
-We've been made!

11:27.600 --> 11:29.921
- Grenade! Coulson, we gotta jump!

11:46.720 --> 11:49.200
- The train. It just...
-Yep.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.726
Vanished. Which, I might add,

11:52.280 --> 11:53.327
not easy.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.409
I told Simmons I'd come back for them.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.244
May's there. They'll be okay.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.485
No, she's not.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.969
Is your phone working?

12:15.720 --> 12:19.122
No. Cybertek must've taken out
our electronics.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.931
Not a grenade exactly.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.290
Might be some kind
of cloaking mechanism.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.443
Maybe it created some kind of portal.
Jumped the train there.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.882
Oh, let's hope not.
I can't deal with Asgard today.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.042
Cybertek knew we were coming.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.610
How?

12:36.680 --> 12:39.047
Could've been The Clairvoyant.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.841
We've got to get back to the plane.
Come on.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.204
Keys might be in it.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.887
It's the country. People are
very trusting in the country.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.770
It's running.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.210
Yeah, it's been hotwired.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.044
- This is...
-Suspicious?

13:17.120 --> 13:19.361
I was gonna say fortuitous.
Let's get out of here.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.889
Signore Russo.
What happened?

13:40.960 --> 13:44.009
Agent Coulson. Thank God.
I've been trying to reach you.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.129
Cybertek knew.
They knew we were at the station.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.123
They knew we were on the train, too.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.804
Most of my team is unaccounted for.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.167
Most of my men are dead.
Where are you now?

13:53.240 --> 13:55.129
On our plane,
we'll send you the coordinates.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.124
And Russo. Do you have any idea
what happened to the train?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.043
- What do you mean?
-It vanished.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.610
With our team still on it.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.081
Okay. We'll look into that.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.491
I'm on my way to you now,

14:05.560 --> 14:08.086
maybe together we can
find some answers, yes?

14:08.840 --> 14:12.128
- What now?
-I'll call H.Q. You take this.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.761
We need to figure out
what the hell happened to that train.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.089
Holotable, on.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.563
Holotable, activate.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.641
Okay.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.924
- Oh.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.362
Really?

14:48.240 --> 14:49.241
Ah.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.727
S.H.I.E.L.D. pulled satellite images.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.609
- And?
-Train's gone.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.125
They're checking alternate routes.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.646
If it's somewhere on Earth, we'll find it.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.483
It's pretty tricky, right?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.884
I couldn't even find the "on" button.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.605
Can you zoom in?

15:21.040 --> 15:24.044
I think Fitz-Simmons do
something more like...

15:29.680 --> 15:30.841
Damn.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.884
Let's just upload the specs to H.Q.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.769
- Good idea.
-Yeah.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.243
Oh, uh. Sir? This probably isn't
the best time, but what May told you...

15:42.960 --> 15:44.883
I would have preferred it stay
between me and her.

15:45.320 --> 15:49.530
Well, "it" is happening on my bus.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.884
Amongst members of my team.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.447
No, we've never done...

15:54.520 --> 15:57.285
It's never happened on the bus, sir.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.964
You wanna do this now?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.761
Okay, what you're doing
is against protocol

16:02.480 --> 16:07.327
so, if you endanger an operation,
or if anyone gets hurt,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.050
I'll reassign you to Barrow, Alaska.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.690
And you'll spend the rest of your years

16:10.760 --> 16:13.570
pulling the night shift
guarding Blonsky's cryo-cell.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.330
Am I clear?

16:17.760 --> 16:19.364
I'll take that as a yes.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.330
And if it's really just sex, Ward,

16:23.080 --> 16:25.321
you should get more comfortable
using the word.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.406
Agent Coulson. It's gonna be all right.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.246
We found your people. The train, it's...

16:43.280 --> 16:44.964
Wheels up in five.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.960
As we round the bend,

16:56.040 --> 16:59.089
the passengers on the north side
of the train can take in the views

16:59.160 --> 17:03.609
of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo.
Isn't it a wonder?

17:04.200 --> 17:05.770
Ward, you're up.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.287
- Ward?

17:08.040 --> 17:11.249
Something's wrong.
Cybertek's leaving the dining car.

17:11.319 --> 17:12.481
Ward? Coulson...

17:25.079 --> 17:27.810
Fitz? Skye? Can anyone read me?

18:00.320 --> 18:03.369
I've gotta get you guys somewhere safe.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.404
We've been looking for you, Agent May.

18:54.480 --> 18:58.007
Get your bearings, sweetheart.
Get your bearings. There you go.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.366
There you go.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.967
I realize you're confused.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.926
But I'm here to help. You see,

19:07.160 --> 19:10.960
I make sure Cybertek products
move across Italy without incident,

19:11.040 --> 19:13.407
they make sure I'm well taken care of.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.081
And they'll take care of you, too.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.971
All you have to do

19:18.040 --> 19:22.170
is tell me where Agent Coulson
and Ward are. That's it.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.400
Why are you smiling?

19:27.720 --> 19:29.484
You called me sweetheart.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.607
Fine. Have it your way.

19:37.960 --> 19:42.409
Just remember, your boss asked
to be a part of this op.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.763
I warned him against it.

19:45.160 --> 19:49.006
So if you're looking for someone
to blame, look to him.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.886
That's just what I needed.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.281
Russo!

20:13.280 --> 20:14.930
And if it's really just sex, Ward,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.651
you should get more comfortable
using the word.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.202
Agent Coulson. It's gonna be all right.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.125
We found your people.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.325
The train, it's...

20:33.240 --> 20:35.004
Wheel's up in five.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.731
You okay? You were on the train
when it disappeared.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.810
May. Russo was...
Explain yourself, please.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.924
The train didn't disappear.
Russo sold us out.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.843
Get the plane ready. I need a shower.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.924
You're hurt. Let me stitch you up.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.128
I said get the plane ready.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.521
Let me help.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.721
You know,

21:17.920 --> 21:20.207
we have this stuff for a reason.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.322
S.H.I.E.L.D. found the train.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.041
Turns out it switched tracks
shortly after we got off.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.403
The grenade must've released
some kind of toxin,

21:54.480 --> 21:57.006
made us believe no time had passed.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.004
Yeah, I saw you guys
frozen on the field.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.564
You looked ridiculous.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.007
It wasn't supposed to be a combat op.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.769
They'll be fine.
They can handle themselves.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.170
I got it. Gently.

22:15.880 --> 22:16.961
Okay.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.246
Thank you.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.610
Did he get you anywhere else?

22:29.360 --> 22:31.203
We need to re-route the plane.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.327
Just got word from S.H.l.E.L.D

22:32.400 --> 22:35.051
that the train stopped suddenly
in the Italian countryside.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.168
What? Why?

22:37.240 --> 22:40.642
We'll find out soon. I'll set
the coordinates. Touchdown in 10.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.041
- I'll come help.
-I got it.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.121
Got parked here 15 minutes ago.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.009
Agents on the ground
have no idea why.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.082
Any sign of Fitz-Simmons and Skye?

23:03.160 --> 23:04.400
No.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.569
Everyone, get down!

23:34.960 --> 23:36.450
Simmons! Stop!

23:44.720 --> 23:46.688
Where are Fitz and Skye?

23:56.840 --> 24:00.128
As we round the bend, the passengers
on the north side of the train...

24:00.200 --> 24:03.443
I wish we had more time
to take in the scenery.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.081
Three peaks of Lavaredo.
They're supposed to be stunning.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.527
Any chance what's in there
could be an 084?

24:10.600 --> 24:13.001
This? No. We may not know what it is,

24:13.080 --> 24:15.082
but we do know
that it came from Cybertek.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.442
Right. Unknown origin.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.442
The one we found in Peru
was a machine,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.801
-but they don't always have to be, right?
-No.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.245
No, I've read about all kinds.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.210
Weapons, spacecraft, energy sources.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.203
I suppose the only thing
they really do have in common

24:29.320 --> 24:31.402
is that they're dangerous.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.451
Right.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.291
Hey, whatever this package turns
out to be, we'll deal with it.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.124
Like we always do.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.407
We've faced worse
and made it through.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.289
Fitz,

24:46.360 --> 24:49.682
have you ever heard
of an 084 being a person?

24:49.800 --> 24:51.086
No.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.091
Although I suppose it's possible.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.560
Hate to meet the guy.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.167
--Whoa.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.044
May's goggles are offline.
When did that happen?

25:00.120 --> 25:01.565
May, do you copy?

25:03.640 --> 25:05.210
All comms and phones are dead.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.408
Someone's using some sort
of electronic scrambler.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.369
Cybertek knows we're here.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.965
I have to warn our team.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.690
Fitz! Get down.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.204
--We've been made!

25:32.280 --> 25:33.566
Oh, bloody hell!

25:34.440 --> 25:35.487
Jemma!

25:35.560 --> 25:36.686
Ahhh!

25:38.960 --> 25:40.644
Oh, my God.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.651
She's okay.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.370
Okay, hold her up.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.044
There we go.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.811
I think this is some form of dendrotoxin.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.641
The same stuff that's
in the Night-Night gun?

26:08.720 --> 26:12.645
Yeah, but it's clearly evolved.
I think they made it airborne.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.208
Is that why their eyes are open?

26:15.520 --> 26:17.249
I suppose if they're in
some sort of black sleep,

26:17.320 --> 26:19.049
that would make sense.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.330
We gotta get out of here.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.323
Find the others and figure out
what to do next.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.925
Yeah, help me move Simmons first.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.604
Can't just leave her like this.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.684
Look at her little face.
She'd be so embarrassed.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.570
We should leave her with something
to protect herself. Just in case.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.688
Yeah. I have a spare.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.290
What about him?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.211
That's for Simmons.

27:00.440 --> 27:01.487
Train stopped.

27:01.560 --> 27:05.884
I know. And I looked everywhere.
May, Ward, and Coulson are gone.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.164
What about Cybertek?

27:20.400 --> 27:22.607
They have the package, Fitz.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.763
What do we do?
We're the only ones left.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.290
Do you have an extra tracker?

27:28.400 --> 27:29.890
Of course.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.129
Then we follow them.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.931
Hey-

27:53.800 --> 27:57.964
Coulson was right.
Cybertek led us to Quinn.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.283
Activate the tracker.
Let them know we're here.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.524
You want to go in?

28:08.600 --> 28:10.762
We can't let Quinn get away again.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.367
If Coulson were here,
he wouldn't let that happen.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.602
He wouldn't want us to let that happen.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.845
You're right.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.810
Let's do it.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.245
Can you disable their cars?

28:25.320 --> 28:26.651
With my bare hands.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.521
Take this.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.803
- You'll need it out here.
-Just take it.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.849
Be careful, okay?

28:41.040 --> 28:42.644
You too.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.687
Okay.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.965
Find Mr. Quinn.
Tell him his purchase is downstairs.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.445
- Mike?
-MANI Hello.

30:48.320 --> 30:52.370
Skye. The Clairvoyant
told me to expect you.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.965
Signore Quinn,

30:54.120 --> 30:55.929
this is the same gun
as the specs you gave us.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.927
You guys have been looking at us.
Well, we've been looking at you.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.449
And we found a handful of some
particularly interesting things.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.286
Mike.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.646
Oh, God.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.360
You're alive.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.489
That's right.
You two know each other. Hey.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.645
Do you know who I am?

31:32.040 --> 31:34.327
And you have your orders?

31:35.680 --> 31:37.330
Good. Because I purchased something

31:37.400 --> 31:39.721
that's gonna help you complete them.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.889
Orders? Mike.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.168
What is happening here?

31:49.840 --> 31:50.841
Mike.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.329
Stand, please.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.209
Ahhh!

32:38.440 --> 32:40.124
Mancini, thank you.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.567
You will be receiving
your payment shortly.

32:46.720 --> 32:50.202
That is the best money can buy,
my friend.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.608
Every piece of technology in you
is top of the line.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.485
I just wonder if I'm getting
my money's worth.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.324
I know you get your orders
from The Clairvoyant.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.483
So that means you're not allowed
to hurt me, right?

33:02.560 --> 33:03.607
No.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.401
What if I tried to hurt you?

33:11.400 --> 33:13.528
Would you stop me?

33:14.800 --> 33:17.451
No. I would not.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.764
Mike, listen.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.765
I don't know what they're doing to you,

33:22.840 --> 33:25.605
but we have to get out of here. Now.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.650
And if I wanted you to hurt her?

33:33.760 --> 33:36.331
You know, to kill her,

33:37.520 --> 33:38.806
Will you?

33:41.360 --> 33:43.283
I mean, what would hurt
Agent Coulson more

33:43.360 --> 33:45.966
than to lose his pet project?

33:46.960 --> 33:48.803
Those aren't my orders.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.161
She's not who I'm supposed to kill.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.126
Wait. Wait. Wait!

33:58.800 --> 34:01.007
- What the hell did you do to him?

34:32.719 --> 34:34.085
I'm sorry.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.650
I have my orders, too.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.525
Help.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.282
- Where's Quinn?
-Where's our money?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.806
There is no money. You failed.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.851
It looks like it's working to me.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.928
Apparently, there's been
a misunderstanding.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.570
We delivered the package as promised.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.929
If we can just speak to Mr. Quinn...

35:34.080 --> 35:36.208
The Clairvoyant isn't happy.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.009
You led S.H.I.E.L.D. right to us.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.764
Let her go.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.250
Skye.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.440
Where's Skye?

36:00.640 --> 36:03.325
She didn't want to let Quinn get away.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.008
Help. Help. Help-

36:26.520 --> 36:28.488
Driver's not answering.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.443
Oh, Coulson's team finally got here.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.205
Where's Skye?

36:58.640 --> 37:01.325
You know,
Agent Coulson, it's dangerous

37:02.040 --> 37:05.408
to keep sending her in
like that, all alone.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.803
When she means so much to you.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.011
Search the house. Find her! Now!

37:19.840 --> 37:21.683
Oh... No.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.289
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Simmons! Get down here!

37:28.200 --> 37:29.929
Oh, God. Hang on.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.404
Just hang on, okay?

37:34.160 --> 37:35.321
Oh, God.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.804
She's been shot.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.211
Keep her upright.

37:40.680 --> 37:41.920
I got no pulse.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.570
She's lost too much blood.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.681
Put her in there.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.762
- Do you even know what this thing is?
-it's a hyperbaric chamber.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.604
And I said, put her in there. Now.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.205
- Okay.
-Let's go.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.444
All right. Gentle.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.124
I need to get
her temperature down, Fitz.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.690
Yeah, okay, I got it.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.883
- Temperature's dropping.
-Pressure's stabilizing.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.121
Is it working?

38:26.600 --> 38:27.931
Is it working?

38:36.640 --> 38:38.085
For now.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.883
Her core temperature's hovering
around 44 degrees Fahrenheit.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.247
If we don't bring her back up
to temp in the next few hours,

38:56.320 --> 38:58.891
she could sustain
permanent brain damage.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.169
We need to get her
to a medical facility, and fast.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.925
Until then, I'll do everything I can
to keep her alive.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.365
Excuse me.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.041
It's not your fault.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.005
She never should've gone
in there alone.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.691
Blaming yourself won't help her.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.283
I'm not blaming myself.
