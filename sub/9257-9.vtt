WEBVTT

00:02.408 --> 00:06.399
Store owner says he heard the shots.
He didn't come out to take a look.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.827
That make him gutless or smart?

00:08.999 --> 00:14.807
–Probably a little of both.
–The D.M.V says she had a '96
Ford Escort registered to her.

00:18.115 --> 00:20.504
Where the hell are the tech guys?

00:20.675 --> 00:24.864
–A knife fight over on Stanton.
–Hurry up and wait time.

00:26.465 --> 00:29.847
No, no.
I'm gonna try the gum again.

00:30.016 --> 00:32.404
You'll be back
on the tar in a week.

00:32.575 --> 00:35.509
Thanks for your support.

00:38.206 --> 00:42.994
–Christ almighty, my whole life is going by.
–Vic.

00:43.132 --> 00:46.775
Huh. Gilroy's in the house.

00:46.971 --> 00:49.545
Hey. What brings you
to the front line?

00:49.562 --> 00:52.017
A car jacking at 2:00
in the afternoon.

00:52.057 --> 00:55.320
Yeah, well.
Business as usual on the Farm.

00:55.354 --> 00:58.483
Look, uh, I wanted
to talk to you in person.

00:58.679 --> 01:02.606
The… The command
of this new Strike Team.

01:05.364 --> 01:09.391
–I'm having a hard time
selling you to the chief.
–Oh, balls!

01:09.524 --> 01:14.210
I know the area. I know the players.
No one can do this better than me.

01:14.259 --> 01:18.313
The chief's not looking for somebody
better. He's looking for somebody more…

01:18.353 --> 01:20.785
What? What's the problem?

01:20.818 --> 01:22.856
He's worried about all
your run-ins with Plotkin.

01:22.896 --> 01:25.257
–Aw, Plotkin was an asshole.
–He was your superior.

01:25.297 --> 01:28.582
Yeah, and I've done my penance
for a year and a half because of him.

01:28.622 --> 01:32.930
–I'm never gonna get another shot?
–Not this one, Vic. I'm sorry.

01:37.804 --> 01:42.122
No. I need to get out
on the street, cleaning it up.

01:42.155 --> 01:46.311
I mean,
you gotta talk to the chief again.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.599
–What?
–You can make it happen.

01:49.639 --> 01:51.615
Pull a favor.
Just get me the assignment.

01:51.655 --> 01:53.767
Get me Shane on the Strike Team.

01:53.798 --> 01:55.998
–That's another one with a spotty jacket.
–Shane's a good cop.

01:56.038 --> 01:57.761
And he works well with me.

01:57.957 --> 02:01.653
You can fill the rest of the team
with whoever you like.

02:02.276 --> 02:04.282
Ben, I need this.

02:07.778 --> 02:09.691
I've only got one marker
to use with the chief.

02:09.731 --> 02:12.857
If it use it, I need results.
I need them quick…

02:12.897 --> 02:17.085
or we're both out of a job.
–Just give me the chance.

02:17.247 --> 02:19.581
The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug.

02:19.615 --> 02:22.963
–Your own team, wow.
–I just can't blow it.

02:23.262 --> 02:25.236
–You won't.
–A lot of O.T.

02:25.373 --> 02:28.020
It's more money, but
it's less time with you and the kids.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.329
We'll manage.
You have to do this.

02:30.492 --> 02:34.003
–Ben picked you, didn't he?
–Yeah.

02:34.202 --> 02:36.081
After looking
for any reason not to.

02:36.121 --> 02:39.284
And he couldn't find one,
so show him.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.230 --> 03:15.018
Whoa!

03:33.416 --> 03:35.139
Can I help you?

03:36.231 --> 03:39.531
I'm Detective Mackey.
I'm running the Strike Team.

03:39.942 --> 03:42.109
We're still interviewing
for that position.

03:42.149 --> 03:46.338
I hope not. Assistant
Chief Gilroy told me I start tomorrow.

03:47.364 --> 03:50.843
I figured I'd settle in early.
Hit the ground running.

03:50.883 --> 03:52.605
Gilroy told you that?

03:54.049 --> 03:56.536
Huh.
I'm Captain David Aceveda.

03:57.825 --> 04:00.795
–You said your name was Mackey, right?
–Yeah.

04:02.815 --> 04:04.538
I read your file.

04:07.070 --> 04:10.005
We have a chance to
do something real special here.

04:10.045 --> 04:13.688
Well, you let me know
how I can help.

04:27.895 --> 04:32.462
I don't care how you did it in the past. But in
this house, we're gonna work together.

04:32.502 --> 04:36.756
Special squads, detectives,
uniformed police officers.

04:36.917 --> 04:40.427
We'll help each other and share
information however and whenever we can.

04:40.467 --> 04:43.499
It's the only way that this
satellite precinct can work.

04:43.539 --> 04:49.017
I'd like to thank the man responsible for our
new jobs, Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.316
Thank you, Captain.

04:57.486 --> 05:00.126
You all know this unit
is a trial squad.

05:01.422 --> 05:03.144
An expensive one.

05:03.341 --> 05:06.276
People say it's a waste
of time and tax dollars.

05:06.316 --> 05:08.071
I don't believe that.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.852
Let's prove them wrong.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.239
–Thanks, Big Ben.
–Good luck, Vic.

05:22.407 --> 05:25.188
Come on, Brent.
I remember you.

05:26.310 --> 05:29.756
Sofer, uh, you did your P-2
over at Central, huh?

05:30.213 --> 05:32.985
–Yeah.
–Who sucked you into this hellhole?

05:32.995 --> 05:35.197
I couldn't pass up the long hours
and the low pay.

05:35.237 --> 05:37.275
–You ready, boot?
–Yes, Ma'am.

05:37.762 --> 05:40.336
–Don't ever call me “ma'am.”
–Yes, sir.

05:40.417 --> 05:44.954
–Just Danny, okay?
–All right, Danny.

05:45.152 --> 05:48.025
I know you two haven't worked
Farmington as much as Shane and I have…

05:48.065 --> 05:50.774
so I want you to get out
on the street, cultivate C.Is…

05:50.814 --> 05:53.525
find out who's hating, who's mating.
–Knowledge is power.

05:53.565 --> 05:55.284
Cool. When do we get started?

05:55.324 --> 05:58.677
Already have. I put a list together
of the neighborhood dickheads.

05:58.717 --> 06:01.779
We're gonna make some house calls.
Let them know who's new in town.

06:01.819 --> 06:05.845
This is gonna rock, man.
Thanks for letting me join the band.

06:08.601 --> 06:11.632
–Might have been a mistake.
–Oh, yeah? Who let the guy
with the mustache in?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.606
–The ladies love the 'stache.
–Listen, guys.

06:14.743 --> 06:17.326
Trust isn't something
that happens overnight.

06:17.366 --> 06:20.864
And trust me, where we're going,
we're gonna need it.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.790
Yeah.

06:23.988 --> 06:26.256
Sorry.

06:26.419 --> 06:29.996
We… We have a drive-by,
gang-related, one fatality.

06:30.194 --> 06:31.917
That's you.

06:36.272 --> 06:38.279
–We're on.
–Let's do it.

06:42.126 --> 06:44.774
–What happened?
–Yo, man, they killed Wanda.

06:44.814 --> 06:47.333
They took Jolene off
in an ambulance.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.180
–Polly's shot somewhere.
–Looks like you got off easy.

06:50.220 --> 06:52.515
–Who did it?
–Yo, man, I didn't see him.

06:52.555 --> 06:55.750
–What's your name?
–Ringo.

06:55.914 --> 06:59.713
–Parents didn't like you enough
to name you after John or Paul?
–No, I know Ringo.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.997
–Oh, yeah?
–Small-time pimp daddy.

07:02.152 --> 07:04.704
Who'd you piss off?

07:04.808 --> 07:09.626
Yo, man, I was just walkin' with my
girls, mindin' the store. That's all.

07:10.982 --> 07:14.145
I mean in the last
couple of days.

07:16.452 --> 07:18.240
No one.

07:25.921 --> 07:28.569
Someone's trying
to mark their territory.

07:28.609 --> 07:30.331
Who's the lion?

07:32.862 --> 07:35.256
See what you can
drum up out of Ringo.

07:35.296 --> 07:37.973
I know one of the girls
that works for him. Owes me.

07:38.013 --> 07:40.695
–I'll see if she can help.
–Okay.

07:40.892 --> 07:45.171
The classroom's where you learn
the rules, but 70% of the job is instinct.

07:45.211 --> 07:48.723
Morning, Jules. Black tea, please.
You want anything?

07:49.017 --> 07:51.633
Uh, orange juice
and a breakfast burrito.

07:51.673 --> 07:55.376
–I'll take care of that.
–That's okay, man. On the house.

07:55.416 --> 07:58.716
I appreciate that, but I have to pay.
Regulations.

08:01.526 --> 08:04.820
–Five bucks.
–There you go.

08:26.254 --> 08:30.955
Oh, my God.

08:34.924 --> 08:37.029
Vic.

08:37.163 --> 08:38.755
Can I come in?

08:38.955 --> 08:40.678
Sure, yeah.

08:42.794 --> 08:46.241
–You taking care of Brian now?
–He stays with my mom most of the time.

08:46.281 --> 08:49.280
Sometimes she's got this thing
like three, four hours though.

08:49.320 --> 08:54.600
–And then you're alone with him?
–He's fine. I don't fix while I'm watchin' him.

08:55.653 --> 09:00.507
One of Ringo's girls was killed today.
Another one got shot.

09:00.772 --> 09:03.073
I heard about Wanda.

09:03.268 --> 09:06.169
She was okay.

09:06.306 --> 09:08.956
Uh, any idea
who might have done it?

09:12.128 --> 09:15.062
Well, you heard it
from somewhere else?

09:17.119 --> 09:20.020
Lionel Phipps or his guys.

09:20.158 --> 09:22.965
–Who is he?
–From the neighborhood.
Got his hands in drugs.

09:23.005 --> 09:25.686
Decided he wanted to get
a piece of our asses.

09:25.726 --> 09:29.969
Ringo didn't wanna pay the tax.
Next thing you know…

09:30.299 --> 09:32.021
Stay away from Ringo.

09:32.218 --> 09:35.381
He's a walking target right now.

09:35.513 --> 09:37.301
That's my mom.

09:37.497 --> 09:39.700
Time for me to get to work.

09:41.752 --> 09:45.230
If Lionel is the Lion, then what does
that make you, his wives or his cubs?

09:45.270 --> 09:48.270
Who wants to tell us
about the drive-bys this morning?

09:48.310 --> 09:51.245
–Stop feeling me up, faggot.
–You getting a hard-on, faggot?

09:51.285 --> 09:53.455
Bitch ass!

09:53.588 --> 09:55.856
Hey, hey, hey!

09:56.051 --> 09:58.320
Against the wall!

09:58.482 --> 10:00.074
Up against the wall!

10:00.274 --> 10:02.601
Man, he's the asshole
who started it, man.

10:02.641 --> 10:05.258
There's also about a dozen
citizens watching us, man.

10:05.298 --> 10:08.199
–Just one mistake, that's all it takes.
–Look, he's the cocksucker…

10:08.239 --> 10:10.310
Who just put
himself on our list.

10:10.350 --> 10:13.219
But when the time
is right, understood?

10:13.358 --> 10:15.081
Yeah. I'm sorry.

10:15.277 --> 10:18.511
All right. Let's wrap them up
and take them home.

10:18.924 --> 10:21.291
Get your ass up!

10:26.890 --> 10:29.474
–Wagenbach?
–Yeah. Hi, I'm Dutch…

10:29.673 --> 10:31.680
–You're two hours late.
–What?

10:31.816 --> 10:35.169
–At Sunset, detectives start at 9:00.
–You start here at 7:00.

10:35.209 --> 10:38.334
–Yes, sir. I didn't…
–You're lucky there's a desk left.

10:38.374 --> 10:40.254
That's by the kitchen
and the women's restroom.

10:40.294 --> 10:43.392
–Is there anything else?
–There was at 7:00.

10:44.741 --> 10:47.806
Uh, you might as well
make yourself useful.

10:48.067 --> 10:51.034
A rape victim led us back
to the vacant building she was held in.

10:51.074 --> 10:52.987
–Detectives Gannon and Wyms
are headed there now.
–Tom Gannon?

10:53.027 --> 10:56.153
–Do you know him?
–Not personally. Everyone knows
he solved Beachwood Canyon.

10:56.193 --> 10:58.526
–I hear he's great.
–He's punctual.

11:02.207 --> 11:05.973
Managed to loose the ropes, punch out the
window with her bare hands to get out.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.216
There have been
other women here.

11:08.349 --> 11:10.519
Vacant building, quiet street.

11:10.653 --> 11:12.373
Not much chance of witnesses.

11:12.413 --> 11:14.611
Dutch Wagenbach,
Farmington Division.

11:14.651 --> 11:17.106
Over here, we just call it
the Farm. Tom Gannon.

11:17.146 --> 11:19.895
I know. Beachwood Canyon Slasher.

11:20.090 --> 11:22.194
–Claudette Wyms.
–Wyms?

11:22.328 --> 11:24.210
–You been on the force long?
–Long enough.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.823
–I'm sorry. I just haven't heard of you.
–Why would you?

11:27.863 --> 11:31.726
I like to keep up on my colleagues.
Follow the bigger cases.

11:31.766 --> 11:33.708
–So, Butch…
–Dutch.

11:33.845 --> 11:36.590
We got a Salvadorean illegal,
doesn't speak English…

11:36.630 --> 11:39.211
won't give her name,
her parents, just her story.

11:39.251 --> 11:43.625
–Which is?
–She was kidnapped,
held here by three cholos.

11:44.050 --> 11:46.922
They called somebody for ransom. Threatened
to rape her if they didn't pay.

11:46.962 --> 11:51.783
Called back later, family didn't have the money
yet, so they went to town on her.

11:51.823 --> 11:56.311
After they were done, they tied her up,
left. She managed to escape.

11:58.670 --> 12:01.640
First one to roll
on Lionel gets a free pass.

12:02.348 --> 12:04.835
The rest don't.

12:05.036 --> 12:07.010
So who's talking?

12:10.250 --> 12:14.012
You don't think I'm gonna get
Lionel with or without you?

12:14.185 --> 12:15.679
Okay.

12:15.848 --> 12:17.757
I'll be back in an hour.

12:17.895 --> 12:20.099
See who changes his mind.

12:21.447 --> 12:23.169
Screw you!

12:25.190 --> 12:28.029
I don't think we're
looking at typical rapists.

12:28.069 --> 12:32.887
Sexual predators are antisocial. They're
driven by inadequacy, not money.

12:32.931 --> 12:36.730
Our three will have rap sheets,
but for violent crimes other than rape.

12:36.770 --> 12:40.569
The sexual assault was a punishment
to them, not a proclivity.

12:40.609 --> 12:44.408
Best desk in the house. Right here
by the kitchen, the men's room.

12:44.448 --> 12:48.059
–We lucked out.
–This isn't an isolated case.

12:48.574 --> 12:52.853
Seems like a lot of illegal immigrants
have been getting snatched up on the Farm.

12:52.893 --> 12:56.308
–Our stats don't show that.
–The families don't report it. They just pay.

12:56.348 --> 13:01.496
Several people said I should talk
to someone named Jesus Latigo.

13:01.627 --> 13:04.625
–Who's he?
–Well, I don't know, but I got him coming in.

13:04.665 --> 13:08.210
–Great.
–That's good work, Wyms, but I got you beat.

13:08.408 --> 13:12.239
I dug up a witness, says she saw three
guys driving off from the crime scene.

13:12.279 --> 13:14.255
So I'm running a partial plate.

13:14.295 --> 13:16.018
I'll fill in the boss.

13:17.557 --> 13:21.741
So, Tom, when you broke Beachwood,
what made you think the stepbrother?

13:21.781 --> 13:26.092
Something just wasn't right about
that kid. His stepsister was all cut up…

13:26.132 --> 13:30.378
but he didn't even seem worried about his
mother's safety or his two real sisters.

13:30.418 --> 13:35.080
–You see, he loved them.
–Anyone know what the partner
situation is around here?

13:35.120 --> 13:40.710
–Captain's still working on it.
–Maybe we could work together.
I could learn a lot from you.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.757
Yeah. Well…

13:42.894 --> 13:44.868
maybe it'll end up like that.

13:47.596 --> 13:51.907
–When I heard what had happened
to Anabel, I was sick.
–How did you know her family?

13:51.947 --> 13:54.983
–I'm a friend.
–Well, we have to talk to them.

13:55.050 --> 13:59.271
–See what the kidnappers said to them.
–They won't come in.

13:59.433 --> 14:01.280
My clients are illegals.
You know how it is.

14:01.320 --> 14:05.061
–I thought you were a friend of the family.
–I am.

14:05.255 --> 14:07.710
Are they also your clients?
Are you a lawyer?

14:07.750 --> 14:09.669
No, no. I'm just a friend.

14:09.703 --> 14:13.276
Everyone I talked to said that you're the man
to see about dealing with kidnappers.

14:13.316 --> 14:15.454
What does that mean?

14:16.772 --> 14:18.876
I've really said too much.

14:20.546 --> 14:22.368
No, you haven't.

14:22.561 --> 14:26.113
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it. I didn't mean that.

14:26.146 --> 14:29.710
I was told this is the ladies room.
Oh, I guess it is.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.088
Gannon, you creaky old sack of shit.
What are you doing?

14:32.128 --> 14:36.373
Gilroy asked me to do him a favor and bring
a little credibility to this old barn.

14:36.413 --> 14:38.136
Barn. I like that.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.276
–I heard you're running the Strike Team.
–Yeah.

14:40.316 --> 14:42.964
–They're giving me the shot.
–That's good.

14:43.004 --> 14:48.273
Plotkin's probably pissing blood just thinking
about it. Have you talked to Joe Clarke lately?

14:48.313 --> 14:50.707
–He's enjoying his retirement.
–I'm looking forward to it myself.

14:50.747 --> 14:54.836
These are my guys now. This is,
uh, Curtis, Shane and Ronnie.

14:55.383 --> 14:58.579
–Good, as always.
–Hey.

14:58.678 --> 15:02.158
–What are you working on now?
–Some illegal got gang-banged.

15:02.198 --> 15:04.559
The victim's more concerned
with Mommy and Daddy's I.N.S status…

15:04.599 --> 15:07.244
than catching the pricks
that spooned her.

15:07.284 --> 15:10.571
–Who are you partnered up with?
–That black girl and some Dutch guy.

15:10.611 --> 15:12.945
–Who?
–Come here.

15:13.107 --> 15:14.829
Come take a look.

15:18.576 --> 15:20.424
I keep hiding his chair on him.

15:20.464 --> 15:24.041
–You're starting already?
–Every house needs a rube.

15:24.271 --> 15:28.325
–And you're anointing this guy?
–Oh, yeah. I got the scoop from Sunset.

15:28.365 --> 15:32.164
His wife was a big boozer, so he puts her
in A.A, thinkin' he's getting her help.

15:32.204 --> 15:35.815
And she ends up getting
shtupped by her sponsor.

15:35.947 --> 15:39.842
And the kicker is she finally tells him
not only is she leaving him…

15:39.882 --> 15:42.984
she's having this other guy's kid.
–Oh, no, no.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.592
Maybe we should
cut him a break then.

15:46.632 --> 15:50.079
Nah.

15:50.215 --> 15:55.712
My guy says that Dutch-boy is just
a big windbag, needs his sails trimmed.

15:55.973 --> 15:59.038
–Doesn't anyone knock?
–This one's Wyms.

15:59.172 --> 16:01.473
–Hello.
–Hello.

16:01.636 --> 16:03.778
I got someone in interrogation.

16:03.812 --> 16:06.266
–Who?
–Why don't you come upstairs and find out?

16:06.306 --> 16:08.444
Yeah, I'll be right there.

16:11.104 --> 16:15.162
All business. She'll
never last around here.

16:21.053 --> 16:23.284
–This ain't gonna work.
–What do you mean?

16:23.324 --> 16:25.237
There's not enough oxygen
in there for the three of us.

16:25.277 --> 16:29.749
–Fletch, you hang back.
We'll tell you how it goes.
–Sure.

16:30.042 --> 16:33.903
Mr Latigo, this is
my partner, Tom Gannon.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.231
There's just one
cage here, right?

16:41.335 --> 16:44.782
–Uh, excuse me. Where did our prisoners go?
–The captain released them.

16:44.822 --> 16:46.894
–Why?
–Ask him.

16:51.605 --> 16:53.547
–Captain, I have a question.
–Yes?

16:53.587 --> 16:58.474
Well, I was just wondering why you cut my
prisoners loose without checking with me.

16:58.514 --> 17:00.746
I saw the paperwork.
It was a mess.

17:00.786 --> 17:05.511
There was no probable cause. The D.A
wouldn't have taken the case, so I let them go.

17:05.550 --> 17:09.384
Maybe you'll remember this the next time
you turn in such sloppy paperwork.

17:09.424 --> 17:13.384
I wasn't looking for a conviction.
I was just sweatin' them.

17:13.422 --> 17:15.653
It's a holding cell,
Detective, not a sauna.

17:15.693 --> 17:18.085
It's reserved for
legitimate, actual arrests.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.675
–They were part of my murder investigation.
–What investigation?

17:20.714 --> 17:23.554
I haven't seen anything of merit. Where
are the suspects? Where are the leads?

17:23.594 --> 17:26.080
You sent them off packing.

17:28.584 --> 17:31.519
Commanding the Strike Team
is a prized position.

17:31.559 --> 17:34.049
We had a lot of candidates
just as qualified, if not more.

17:34.089 --> 17:37.521
So get your act together,
or I'll find someone else.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.013
Are we clear?

17:42.213 --> 17:44.416
Yes, sir.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.360
How's the first day going?

17:51.394 --> 17:54.110
A few bugs,
but I'm working them out.

17:54.433 --> 17:57.051
Anything I should know about?

17:57.152 --> 18:00.023
Your guy Mackey, he's not off
to a very impressive start.

18:00.063 --> 18:04.598
–He'll get results.
–Maybe. But I'd like to put
a backup plan in place.

18:04.638 --> 18:07.511
Fill the last open slot
with a guy who could…

18:07.551 --> 18:10.323
run the Strike Team
if Mackey flunked out.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.715
Give the man a chance,
David. It's day one.

18:13.915 --> 18:16.019
I've read his file,
called around.

18:16.059 --> 18:18.807
A lot of people
won't work with him.

18:19.001 --> 18:21.521
It's a crucial slot.
We can do better.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.686
I need this experiment
to be successful.

18:24.824 --> 18:28.335
–So do you.
–Then we need someone who can deliver.

18:29.622 --> 18:31.661
He will.

18:33.493 --> 18:36.460
Come up with some candidates
though, just in case.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.155
I'll pick somebody personally.

18:38.195 --> 18:41.068
No, come up with a few guys,
run them through my office.

18:41.108 --> 18:43.850
–You shouldn't have to be bothered.
–It's too important.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.992
I'm making all personnel
decisions around here.

18:48.081 --> 18:51.447
Just keep an eye on things.
I'll be in touch later.

18:56.846 --> 18:58.569
Hey.

19:04.363 --> 19:06.178
Heard about your spat
with Aceveda.

19:06.218 --> 19:08.578
Aw, we're just getting
used to each other.

19:08.618 --> 19:10.862
No time for
a learning curve, Vic.

19:10.890 --> 19:13.121
The chief gave me
everything I wanted here…

19:13.161 --> 19:15.397
but I had to take on Aceveda.

19:15.561 --> 19:18.721
He's not going anywhere. Now, do you
have leads on this drive-by or not?

19:18.761 --> 19:22.985
Hell, yeah. We think this street thug
named Lionel is behind it.

19:23.014 --> 19:26.748
–Then make your case, and put
the Strike Team on the map.
–We will.

19:26.788 --> 19:29.052
Just might need
a little more time.

19:29.092 --> 19:33.243
The chief's not gonna have any patience.
Which means I don't either.

19:33.283 --> 19:35.551
We clear?

19:42.079 --> 19:44.887
The people I've talked to
say you're a ransom broker.

19:44.927 --> 19:49.525
Detaining someone is a heinous crime,
but very lucrative in Latin America.

19:49.565 --> 19:53.077
–Detain, my ass. You're a goddamn kidnapper.
–I'm a consultant.

19:53.117 --> 19:54.996
The kidnappers demand a ransom.

19:55.036 --> 19:58.388
The families hire me to broker the deal,
get their loved ones back safely.

19:58.428 --> 20:02.290
–And you do this out of
the goodness of your heart?
–I charge a commission.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.178
I have a 100% recovery rate.

20:04.217 --> 20:07.280
–'Cause your buddies are
the ones doing the kidnapping.
–No.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.224
Because I understand how to negotiate with
these people. The Salvadoreans do not.

20:10.264 --> 20:12.046
Negotiate with what people?

20:12.183 --> 20:17.037
Mexicans. They see the Salvadoreans
as lower class. They target them.

20:17.205 --> 20:18.895
–And what are you?
–Honduran.

20:18.935 --> 20:21.387
So, look, where are
these kidnappers now?

20:21.427 --> 20:23.148
I've never met them.
We arrange a drop.

20:23.188 --> 20:26.186
–How do you contact them?
–They page me to a pay phone.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.196
–Next time they page you, you tell us.
–Look.

20:29.361 --> 20:33.514
I'm successful because the families
and the kidnappers both trust me.

20:33.554 --> 20:36.488
I lead you to these men. All the others
will never work with me again.

20:36.528 --> 20:39.367
If there were no more brokers,
it would be harder to do business…

20:39.407 --> 20:41.894
and maybe the kidnappings would stop.
–Oh, no.

20:41.934 --> 20:45.542
There'll always be kidnappings. And the
families will hire other brokers who don't care.

20:45.582 --> 20:47.907
Brokers who take
the money and keep it.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.341
And the kidnappers
will kill the victims.

20:50.381 --> 20:52.866
And the broker says,
“That's just the way it goes.”

20:52.906 --> 20:57.065
Well, I care. I pay the money.
I get people back alive.

20:57.099 --> 21:00.333
Look, are you gonna lead us
to these guys or not?

21:00.456 --> 21:02.398
I can't.

21:03.751 --> 21:08.101
–Talk to me.
–We wait a couple of weeks.

21:08.135 --> 21:11.325
We wait till one of Lionel's
guys slips up on some felony.

21:11.365 --> 21:13.628
–And then we flip him.
–We don't have a couple of weeks.

21:13.668 --> 21:15.389
Lem and I spoke
to Narcotics and Vice.

21:15.429 --> 21:18.618
They've been trying to make a case against
Lionel for months. They're at a dead end.

21:18.658 --> 21:21.497
–They have nothing for us?
–That's what they said.

21:21.537 --> 21:23.992
God!

21:25.696 --> 21:28.281
We gotta nail him,
like right now.

21:28.479 --> 21:31.352
Okay, so we keep at him.
We hit him long enough and hard
enough, he'll get the message.

21:31.392 --> 21:33.558
You an expert on making
guys long and hard?

21:33.598 --> 21:37.021
Hey, this isn't funny.

21:37.054 --> 21:41.684
I mean, it's the goddamn first day,
and the bosses are already talking
about making changes.

21:41.724 --> 21:45.156
Anybody here feel like
going back to their old post?

21:45.211 --> 21:46.933
Huh?

21:57.910 --> 22:00.909
Look, I hate
to say this, but, uh…

22:01.045 --> 22:03.827
I think we need a shortcut.

22:05.044 --> 22:06.767
Like what?

22:08.531 --> 22:14.405
Maybe we need to squeeze a guy
in Lionel's outfit, make him produce
some evidence for us.

22:19.664 --> 22:21.835
That'd speed things up a bit.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.398
Produce as in plant?

22:24.432 --> 22:29.067
Hey, we all know that this guy's
an asshole in the first degree.

22:29.676 --> 22:32.324
It's for goddamn sure this isn't
the first body he's responsible for.

22:32.364 --> 22:35.136
–I don't know, man.
–You just hear me out.

22:36.810 --> 22:40.898
A high-profile bust gets us credibility
out on the street and with the bosses.

22:40.938 --> 22:44.448
Once we get our feet on solid ground,
get a couple of wins under our belt…

22:44.488 --> 22:46.930
we go back to doing it
the right way.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.263
Hey, we need this.

22:53.958 --> 22:55.680
Just this once.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.850
Hey, where we goin'?
Ain't no police station this way.

23:05.890 --> 23:07.804
Yeah, well, we a mobile unit.

23:07.873 --> 23:09.306
Why you in such a hurry
to go to jail anyway?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.608
Bringin' me in for
a couple of joints, man?

23:11.648 --> 23:14.488
I ain't doin' time
for no three sticks of chronic.

23:14.528 --> 23:17.560
With your record,
I wouldn't be too sure.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.670
You're gonna help us
build a case against Lionel.

23:19.710 --> 23:22.301
Are you on the pipe?

23:22.335 --> 23:25.701
–You see that?
–We had our own
tagger do some work.

23:25.724 --> 23:27.539
We're the new king of this jungle.

23:27.579 --> 23:32.467
–You think paintin' a snake
on the wall makes you top dog?
–Wanna go back for possession?

23:32.507 --> 23:36.401
You guys may be the cops,
but Lionel's the law around here.

23:36.632 --> 23:41.120
You gotta bring it a lot heavier
than this to change people's minds.

23:47.158 --> 23:49.900
–I don't think he's gonna cooperate.
–Give it time.

23:49.940 --> 23:52.306
–If he doesn't?
–I'm thinking.

23:54.035 --> 23:56.364
You know what? Screw Rondell.
We'll just try another homie.

23:56.404 --> 23:58.793
–Lionel will catch wind of it.
–Can't stake him out.

23:58.833 --> 24:00.589
He's smart.

24:00.753 --> 24:03.562
If we bring him in for piddley shit,
Captain Ass will just kick him.

24:03.602 --> 24:07.623
Why don't we get a warrant
based on suspicion of the shooting?
We drop the evidence ourselves.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.502
Lionel will scream “setup.” And that's
exactly what it will look like.

24:10.542 --> 24:13.733
–It can't even remotely appear
like we brought the shit in.
–No.

24:13.773 --> 24:16.132
No, we've gotta have
another cop find it.

24:16.172 --> 24:18.350
How about planting
it in his car?

24:18.412 --> 24:20.939
Crib's the best bet.
When's it empty?

24:20.973 --> 24:25.527
It isn't. He's got girls streaming
in and out of there day and night.

24:29.352 --> 24:32.031
We don't need you
to tell us when they call.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.783
–We'll just wait, get the page ourselves.
–No, they use a code.

24:34.823 --> 24:37.181
Without me, the number
won't make any sense.

24:37.221 --> 24:39.837
I tried to interrogate our victim again.
She still won't talk.

24:39.877 --> 24:42.204
They don't trust the police.
That's why they come to me for help.

24:42.244 --> 24:46.270
I do this community a service.
It's not just about the money.

24:46.371 --> 24:48.094
I help families pro bono…

24:48.290 --> 24:52.315
Cut the champion
of the people crap.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.425
–So what happened?
–Mayfield Duffy…

24:54.465 --> 24:57.368
pushed a cart full of groceries
out of the store without paying.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.255
When my husband went to
stop him, he got attacked.

24:59.295 --> 25:01.654
–What did he hit you with?
–A bag of ice.

25:01.694 --> 25:04.596
–Go call the paramedics.
–Mayfield is okay.

25:04.734 --> 25:06.937
He just had a bad run.
No work.

25:06.972 --> 25:10.900
–He said he will pay for the stuff later.
–I told him we don't do that.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.663
No money, no groceries.

25:14.171 --> 25:17.273
Look, I don't wanna get
Mayfield in no trouble.

25:17.370 --> 25:19.729
I just want the money
or the groceries back.

25:19.769 --> 25:22.034
Well, sir, he committed a felony.
We're gonna have to arrest him.

25:22.074 --> 25:24.780
Well, then go do it.
He took perishables.

25:31.254 --> 25:35.562
–Yeah?
–Step out of the apartment, please.

25:37.555 --> 25:39.726
–You Mayfield Duffy?
–Yeah.

25:39.858 --> 25:42.537
–Step down, please, sir.
–Hands out of your pockets,
sir, and behind your head.

25:42.577 --> 25:44.944
–What's the beef?
–Turn around.

25:45.009 --> 25:47.881
–I told him I'd pay him.
–Before or after you struck him?

25:47.921 --> 25:51.623
–Is Otto okay? I didn't mean to hit him hard.
–Yeah, he's okay.

25:51.663 --> 25:56.389
Second set of cuffs. You know there are
places where you can go for aid, sir.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.625
–I got aid. Then I got robbed.
–Robbed?

25:59.789 --> 26:03.043
I get food stamps twice a month.
That punk gangster in 29…

26:03.083 --> 26:05.826
keeps breaking into the mailbox
and stealing everybody's food stamps.

26:05.866 --> 26:07.906
It will be days before
I can get some more.

26:07.946 --> 26:11.489
Meanwhile, my family's starving.
What am I supposed to do?

26:11.529 --> 26:13.568
Not commit a felony.

26:13.704 --> 26:17.855
–Use this purse.
–It's got a false bottom
and a remote mike inside.

26:17.895 --> 26:20.098
–What's that, coke?
–Crack.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.206
The sentencing is more severe.
Give me your purse.

26:22.246 --> 26:24.579
Come on.

26:28.068 --> 26:30.237
I want you to go inside
Lionel's apartment.

26:30.277 --> 26:33.147
You tell him that you're willing
to pay a street tax…

26:33.187 --> 26:35.674
to stay out
working and stay safe.

26:35.873 --> 26:38.681
–I don't even know this guy.
–He knows about you.

26:38.721 --> 26:41.560
You hide the crack in his bathroom,
under the sink or something.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.047
This is the guy who shot up Wanda?
It'll be a pleasure then.

26:45.087 --> 26:47.159
Hey, hey. You're miked.

26:47.294 --> 26:48.951
We can hear everything.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.284
If at any time the mike fails,
we'll be in there, okay?

26:51.324 --> 26:53.112
–Okay.
–Listen.

26:53.244 --> 26:56.499
This guy is bad. If it seems dangerous,
you just say the word “gringo.”

26:56.539 --> 26:58.323
Then we come
riding to the rescue.

26:58.363 --> 27:00.598
–Gringo?
–Yeah.

27:00.762 --> 27:02.289
Right.

27:03.417 --> 27:07.638
Hey. I mean it. Any sign of worry,
you say the word.

27:17.525 --> 27:21.168
–You Happy Sandez?
–Yeah, that's me. What of it?

27:21.427 --> 27:24.203
You the same Happy Sandez that's
been breaking into people's mailboxes…

27:24.243 --> 27:26.283
stealing their food stamps?
–Food stamps?

27:26.323 --> 27:29.193
–I don't need no ghetto coupons.
–Happy, we got your sheet, man.

27:29.233 --> 27:31.882
You got three priors
for theft and no job.

27:31.922 --> 27:34.727
Why don't you give those people
their food stamps back so they can eat?

27:34.767 --> 27:37.155
I'm missing the game.

27:38.350 --> 27:40.238
I tell you what, Happy.

27:40.271 --> 27:43.812
My partner and I are gonna go around
the corner for exactly two minutes.

27:43.852 --> 27:45.477
And when we come back…

27:45.676 --> 27:48.100
either the food stamps you took
are sitting on that bottom step…

27:48.140 --> 27:49.572
or I'm gonna call
some detectives down here…

27:49.612 --> 27:51.714
and they're gonna turn
your life upside down.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.623
You got it?

27:54.762 --> 27:56.485
You got two minutes.

27:58.536 --> 28:01.416
Screw Ringo. I'm willing to pay you.

28:01.449 --> 28:05.079
–I don't wanna get shot up.
–Smart thinkin', sweet pea.

28:05.094 --> 28:08.127
–So are we cool then?
–Nah, not quite.

28:08.261 --> 28:12.603
See, I like to know what I'm puttin'
on the streets. Come here. Right here.

28:12.643 --> 28:14.525
–He wants to taste the kitty.
–Sure.

28:14.565 --> 28:17.179
–Just let me run to the bathroom.
–What for?

28:17.219 --> 28:19.160
To pop in my diaphragm.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.331
No need, baby girl.
I ain't hitting that raw.

28:27.871 --> 28:30.587
–Oh, yeah.
–Oh, God.

28:30.782 --> 28:33.142
The broker is a pipeline,
but he's decent.

28:33.182 --> 28:35.157
If we talk to him
the right way, he'll talk.

28:35.197 --> 28:39.220
That broker is a dead end. I got my witness
coming in. I think she's our best bet.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.301
You know, I got
30 years experience says…

28:41.341 --> 28:44.146
if we slap this broker
with obstruction of justice…

28:44.186 --> 28:47.024
he misses one home-cooked meal,
he'll talk.

28:50.904 --> 28:55.507
–Tom's got seniority. Follow his lead.
–The witness is here.

28:55.703 --> 28:59.399
–Hi. I'm Detective Gannon. Thanks for coming.
–Carry on.

29:01.429 --> 29:04.876
So, uh, hypothetically…

29:05.044 --> 29:07.377
how would you go
after the broker?

29:07.539 --> 29:09.931
The boss wants to do it
Gannon's way.

29:09.971 --> 29:13.614
And he's going his way.
Doesn't mean we can't go ours.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.831
They teach you that
in the classroom?

29:29.548 --> 29:32.711
Goddamn, you're tight.

29:32.844 --> 29:36.454
Oh, God.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.569
–You ain't gonna dis me again, right?
–No, I swear.

29:41.609 --> 29:43.102
Right?

29:43.272 --> 29:46.400
–I'm going in.
–Hey, hey, hey. She didn't say gringo.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.472
–I'm going.
–Hey! We don't have a warrant.

29:49.606 --> 29:53.500
And we're only gonna get
one shot at this. All right?

29:57.476 --> 29:58.904
I don't care.

29:59.075 --> 30:00.798
Hey, God-goddamn it!

30:02.403 --> 30:05.152
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man. Hey.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.417
She's a pro.

30:07.553 --> 30:09.177
This is what
she does for a living.

30:09.217 --> 30:12.314
We gotta make this case, right?

30:12.448 --> 30:15.065
Right?

30:30.489 --> 30:33.969
–Oh, for God's sake.
–Hey, Vic, Vic, Vic. Come here. Come here.

30:34.009 --> 30:38.710
Hey, look. We're almost there now,
right? All right?

30:54.450 --> 30:58.726
It's in the bathroom,
under the sink.

30:58.897 --> 31:00.685
God.

31:02.352 --> 31:04.294
Vic, I'm okay.

31:14.092 --> 31:15.750
Vic.

31:15.947 --> 31:20.453
I need to score
before you take me home.

31:25.449 --> 31:27.750
–Nice digs, David.
–Nice enough.

31:27.913 --> 31:29.761
You don't sound too excited.

31:29.832 --> 31:31.555
No, I am.

31:31.751 --> 31:33.671
It's just…

31:33.704 --> 31:36.030
Gilroy's stocked the pond
with his own fish.

31:36.070 --> 31:39.700
I'm still figuring out
what waters are safe to swim in.

31:39.909 --> 31:42.615
I could use
a friendly face working here.

31:44.228 --> 31:47.482
Is this gonna be like
the time you tried to get me
to work Narcotics in the Valley?

31:47.522 --> 31:49.145
–It'll be different.
–How?

31:49.185 --> 31:50.745
You'll say yes.

31:50.913 --> 31:55.269
–I'm happy in Robbery.
–This is more money, more action, more fun.

31:56.319 --> 32:00.791
–So what's the job?
–Gilroy's pick for the Strike Team, Vic Mackey.

32:04.541 --> 32:09.111
There's a spot on the team.
Take it. If Mackey doesn't work out…

32:09.436 --> 32:12.599
you'll take his place.
–Run the Strike Team?

32:12.763 --> 32:15.997
Even if he does work out,
it's still a great gig.

32:19.448 --> 32:22.382
Come on. It's a no-lose
situation for you.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.566
Your boy's going down tonight.

32:27.606 --> 32:31.282
The question is
are you going down with him?

32:31.477 --> 32:34.772
Lionel's got drugs in his crib.

32:34.805 --> 32:38.698
–Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib.
–I guess he got sloppy.

32:38.738 --> 32:40.876
Makes me wonder.

32:42.354 --> 32:44.263
You ever get sloppy?

32:46.032 --> 32:48.715
You wouldn't.

32:48.912 --> 32:50.634
Aw, shit!

32:50.831 --> 32:54.405
So we busted Rondell here
on possession for distribution.

32:54.445 --> 32:57.093
–He wants to deal now.
–What can you offer us?

32:57.133 --> 33:00.100
–My boss, Lionel.
–We think he did the drive-bys.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.186
I made deliveries to his house.

33:02.187 --> 33:04.707
He's got product there.
You gotta move on him right away though.

33:04.747 --> 33:07.298
–And you're willing to swear
to this in an affidavit?
–Sure.

33:07.338 --> 33:09.247
Whatever it takes.

33:14.247 --> 33:16.224
Detective Vendrell,
let's take his statement.

33:16.264 --> 33:18.052
Call for a warrant.

33:21.510 --> 33:23.997
–Impressive.
–Thanks.

33:24.165 --> 33:26.076
Getting him to roll
on a heavy hitter…

33:26.116 --> 33:28.284
for a misdemeanor
marijuana charge.

33:28.324 --> 33:30.909
I can't take all the credit.

33:31.203 --> 33:34.969
I don't think he fully grasps the distinction
between felony and misdemeanor.

33:35.009 --> 33:36.923
When that paperwork comes in…

33:37.057 --> 33:39.511
I'd like to go
on that bust with you.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.981
See you in action.

33:42.176 --> 33:44.280
Sure thing.

33:46.270 --> 33:49.397
Your pager just went off.
I know we don't have much time.

33:49.437 --> 33:53.495
–Sorry. I'm bound by tradition.
–This tradition…

33:53.916 --> 33:57.235
does it always include multiple rape?
–No, that was wrong of them.

33:57.275 --> 34:01.393
What if the kidnappers decide
the family owes them money?
They could go after her again.

34:01.433 --> 34:03.123
They probably will.

34:03.321 --> 34:07.153
I see how you're being honorable.
You tell me how they're being honorable.

34:07.193 --> 34:10.319
Look, if you helped us though, if you led us
to them, it would be a message to them…

34:10.359 --> 34:14.284
that the brokers are not the only ones
who have to follow by the rules,
so do the kidnappers.

34:14.324 --> 34:16.975
Your community
would understand that.

34:17.172 --> 34:20.172
They could appreciate
the honor in it.

34:22.547 --> 34:25.841
Informant? Yo, who the hell
told you I got drugs?

34:26.002 --> 34:28.617
That's confidential
for security reasons.

34:28.657 --> 34:32.333
–I'm sure you understand.
–Yo, don't play me, dog.

34:32.527 --> 34:35.239
–I've got a right to face my accuser.
–You can mention that at trial.

34:35.279 --> 34:37.510
Hey, yo, man.
Take it easy over there.

34:37.550 --> 34:40.070
Hey, you heard the man.
Respect the property.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.833
Got something.

34:43.404 --> 34:46.572
Whoa. How many years
of experience in this room…

34:46.828 --> 34:50.536
and the goddamn rookie finds
the brick on his first day.

34:50.730 --> 34:52.643
–Let me see that, man.
–Nice.

34:52.714 --> 34:54.592
Yeah, damn straight.
The kid's a natural.

34:54.632 --> 34:57.248
–I taught him everything he knows.
–I'll bet you did.

34:57.288 --> 35:00.225
Yo, that ain't mine, man.
This is a stone-cold setup.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.879
–You put it there.
–Found it under your sink, sir.

35:02.919 --> 35:06.213
–Well, this is a goddamn setup, man.
–Vic, Vic.

35:06.533 --> 35:08.862
–Check this shit out.
–That's a TAC-9.

35:08.902 --> 35:11.516
It's the same kind of gun used
in the drive-by. We plant this too?

35:11.556 --> 35:13.435
Yo, look.
I didn't shoot nobody.

35:13.475 --> 35:17.699
Is that what ballistics
is gonna tell us about that dead hooker?

35:19.298 --> 35:21.021
I didn't think so.

35:45.081 --> 35:47.921
–I have 10 minutes to get there.
–We better hurry.

35:47.961 --> 35:50.200
Just get in the cage.

35:50.234 --> 35:55.054
–Good work, Vic. You know,
you really pulled it together.
–Thanks.

35:55.126 --> 35:59.405
The chief's happy. He wants another press
conference to trumpet the quick results.

35:59.445 --> 36:02.605
–I'll do most of the talking,
but he wants you there too.
–Sure.

36:02.645 --> 36:06.445
Detective. We got a call from our
kidnappers. We set up a drop.

36:06.485 --> 36:10.537
You mind getting our backs? The captain
said we could help each other out.

36:10.577 --> 36:12.944
Hey, my day's
just getting started.

36:51.686 --> 36:53.856
Shut up!

36:53.989 --> 36:56.476
Get down. Stop!

36:56.643 --> 36:58.651
Get back here!
Stop, goddamn it!

36:58.691 --> 37:01.626
–Down. Hands behind your back.
–Where do you think you're going?

37:01.666 --> 37:04.218
You got him cuffed?

37:05.634 --> 37:08.502
I said stop!

37:14.367 --> 37:16.090
Goddamn it!

37:22.780 --> 37:26.902
All right, we're secure here.

37:28.411 --> 37:31.127
–You all right?
–I got him.

37:46.229 --> 37:48.268
Keep looking.

37:54.674 --> 37:57.194
–That's them.
–Which ones?

37:57.393 --> 37:58.887
Those ones.

38:01.712 --> 38:04.428
Hey, what happened?

38:04.623 --> 38:06.630
Latigo had a change of heart.

38:06.766 --> 38:09.189
–You didn't tell me that.
–It happened quickly.

38:09.229 --> 38:11.432
I've been sitting right here.

38:12.589 --> 38:15.752
–Those our kidnappers?
–Well, uh…

38:15.916 --> 38:18.424
our broker cooperated,
led us to them.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.181
Well done.

38:23.529 --> 38:25.351
Thanks.

38:28.520 --> 38:33.025
–You didn't have to do that.
–Credit's overrated.

38:37.989 --> 38:42.115
Tangible results.
Nice goddamn job.

38:42.149 --> 38:45.213
Both of you, really.
I told you he'd deliver.

38:45.475 --> 38:49.242
–I just didn't think twice on the first day.
–What did you expect?

38:49.282 --> 38:51.932
The whole team
worked well together.

38:52.161 --> 38:55.989
Some things could have been smoother,
but we'll get there.

38:56.671 --> 38:59.990
I'm sure his public defender
will have some questions.

39:00.030 --> 39:04.518
–It's just a few scratches.
–From being dragged through barbed wire.

39:04.829 --> 39:06.584
I told him to stop.

39:06.716 --> 39:10.806
–Bet you next time he listens.
–Come on, fellas.

39:11.002 --> 39:16.414
The job's hard enough without tension
between the walls. We should be celebrating.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.331
Yeah.

39:26.646 --> 39:30.668
Nathan, you gotta be kidding me.
What am I supposed to do now?

39:30.708 --> 39:33.577
–Use the ladies room.
–Jesus Christ.

39:33.716 --> 39:39.524
Relax. The plumber promised me he'd get to
it tomorrow. Try not to destroy that one too.

39:40.561 --> 39:43.401
The obvious thing would
have been to go Gannon's way.

39:43.441 --> 39:47.431
Instead, you got Latigo to do exactly what
he didn't wanna do and feel good doing it.

39:47.471 --> 39:49.255
Some cases you get an instinct.

39:49.295 --> 39:53.094
–I don't get it.
How come I haven't heard of you?
–It's a mystery.

39:53.134 --> 39:55.973
I was thinking… maybe we could
serve as partners again.

39:56.013 --> 39:59.972
–You know, on a permanent basis.
–Wherever I'm needed.

40:00.300 --> 40:04.706
So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him
to put us together, you wouldn't mind?

40:04.746 --> 40:07.047
No, I wouldn't mind.

40:25.859 --> 40:28.226
Okay, who took my chair?

40:34.881 --> 40:37.818
Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched.
We're gonna go get a beer.

40:37.858 --> 40:40.183
Start without me.
I gotta take care of something first.

40:40.223 --> 40:44.598
Look, I, uh, I talked to both of them,
and they're cool about what went down.

40:44.638 --> 40:47.678
–Good.
–We got Lionel.

40:47.711 --> 40:50.972
–Got us a little breathing room.
–Yeah.

40:52.476 --> 40:55.574
–It was easy, wasn't it?
–Yeah.

40:55.707 --> 40:57.878
It was a little too easy.

41:08.471 --> 41:11.694
My church conducts monthly food drives
in Farmington to help feed families.

41:11.734 --> 41:13.453
I don't need the gospel.
I need work.

41:13.493 --> 41:18.477
My pastor knows a lot of people.
I'll ask him if someone's hiring.

41:21.811 --> 41:25.385
Next time, find some help
before you do something stupid.

41:25.425 --> 41:27.953
Yeah.

41:27.986 --> 41:33.596
–What are you doing?
–I'm just letting him know where
his family could get some help.

41:34.191 --> 41:36.358
If you're gonna get emotionally
involved with every collar…

41:36.398 --> 41:38.246
get off the streets
and into social work.

41:38.286 --> 41:40.966
You don't have to tell me
about the streets. I grew up on them.

41:41.006 --> 41:43.812
Living in them and working in them
are two different things.

41:43.852 --> 41:46.339
Look, I know I got a lot
to learn about police work.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.195
And you've got your way
that works for you.

41:48.235 --> 41:50.146
But I got a way
I wanna try for me.

41:50.186 --> 41:52.804
Hey. Oh, Jesus.

41:53.001 --> 41:56.565
–I didn't know we're coed.
–Welcome to the experiment.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.593
–I'll be out in a sec.
–All right. Cool.

41:58.633 --> 42:02.461
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.
It was a good day today.

42:09.316 --> 42:11.516
Hey, man.
So how was it out there?

42:11.556 --> 42:13.082
Fine.

42:13.251 --> 42:16.089
Yeah. There's nothing
like your first time.

42:27.294 --> 42:30.167
–I didn't think Gilroy
was ever gonna sign off on me.
–Don't take it personally.

42:30.207 --> 42:32.533
–He was just busy.
–Well, I'm glad to be here.

42:32.573 --> 42:35.540
You'll like it.
Oh, the John's still broke.

42:35.836 --> 42:37.974
I'm working on it.

42:38.076 --> 42:40.371
–You ready?
–Yeah, I'm ready for anything.

42:40.411 --> 42:43.509
Good, 'cause we get
everything down here.

42:43.642 --> 42:46.929
Starting to get a rep out on the street.
Bad guys don't like seeing us.

42:46.969 --> 42:48.878
It's starting to get fun.

42:49.016 --> 42:52.887
Hey, hey.

42:52.921 --> 42:56.880
–This here is Terry.
He comes to us from Robbery.
–Robbery?

42:57.205 --> 43:00.835
–We love you, pretty boys from Robbery.
–How you doing?

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
⬄25000÷1000⬄
