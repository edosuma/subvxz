WEBVTT

00:10.449 --> 00:12.758
- What did you buy?
- Doodie.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.362
We weren't out of that.

00:15.568 --> 00:17.605
No. I stepped in it, again.

00:17.769 --> 00:20.237
That man has turned our front walk
into a puppy minefield.

00:20.409 --> 00:22.923
I can't believe that guy
still lets his dog do his business

00:23.089 --> 00:25.728
- right in front of our house.
- Well, we've left notes.

00:25.889 --> 00:28.198
- And gotten nowhere.
- Yeah, well, I've had it.

00:28.369 --> 00:31.441
The next time I catch him in the act,
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

00:33.929 --> 00:36.397
- That couldn't be.
- Oh, I hope it is.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.689 --> 00:48.806
That's them.
That's the guy and his dog.

00:49.009 --> 00:50.442
I can't believe it.

00:50.849 --> 00:53.079
That is so rude,
he's just gonna walk away.

00:53.249 --> 00:55.399
Then don't let him. Use your magic.

00:55.849 --> 00:58.158
If you can't teach the dog new tricks,
how about the owner?

00:58.329 --> 01:00.889
Just think of the money we'd save
on carpet cleaning alone.

01:01.289 --> 01:03.883
Phoebe, we can't use our magic
just to teach him,

01:04.049 --> 01:05.197
or anybody else, a lesson.

01:05.569 --> 01:11.007
Why not? It's for the greater good.
I mean, that's our job, right?

01:11.169 --> 01:15.845
Think of it as community service. We'd
be doing the whole block a favour.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.601
Come on.

01:23.209 --> 01:26.121
- Okay, Piper.
- Hope he's not out of my range.

01:27.369 --> 01:28.643
Prue?

01:30.049 --> 01:33.678
- Nice shot.
- An eye for an eye, a shoe for a shoe.

01:36.689 --> 01:38.088
Oh, duck.

01:38.889 --> 01:40.880
- Did he see you?
- So what if he did?

01:41.049 --> 01:43.085
What's he gonna do, cry witch?

01:45.849 --> 01:47.805
Well, we've done our good deed
for the day.

01:47.969 --> 01:50.244
I think I deserve 15 minutes
of channel surfing.

01:50.409 --> 01:53.367
- Who wants coffee?
- I'll grind.

01:56.569 --> 01:59.163
Koko now has a vocabulary
of over 500...

01:59.329 --> 02:00.478
Justice Today.

02:01.009 --> 02:02.328
And Cal Greene tied a record

02:02.489 --> 02:04.923
by smashing his sixth grand slam
of the year today.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.282
Phoebe, are you okay?

02:18.449 --> 02:20.280
Take a deep breath, honey,
it's all right.

02:20.449 --> 02:23.043
No, it's not. I saw my future.

02:24.169 --> 02:25.727
I was being executed.

02:26.889 --> 02:27.878
Burned alive.

04:00.729 --> 04:02.765
Why would a report
about a baseball player

04:02.929 --> 04:05.363
- trigger a premonition like that?
- I don't know.

04:05.529 --> 04:09.078
All I know is I could feel it.
I could feel the fire.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.319
And we were just standing there?
That can't be right.

04:11.489 --> 04:13.366
- It's what I saw.
- There's no way

04:13.529 --> 04:16.487
that we would let that happen.
Not in the past, present or future.

04:16.649 --> 04:21.165
What did I do?
Or what is it that I'm going to do?

04:22.689 --> 04:24.441
That's Leo. I'll get that.

04:27.209 --> 04:29.848
- Hey, stranger.
- Oh, is that what I am now?

04:30.289 --> 04:31.278
Playing hooky?

04:31.889 --> 04:35.404
Well, they're making me work tonight,
so I've got the afternoon off.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.559
The old "I've gotta save the world"
excuse again?

04:38.729 --> 04:40.720
Oh, like you've never had to use it.

04:43.729 --> 04:45.048
You're about to use it.

04:45.689 --> 04:47.805
Well, there's just something
I have to do.

04:47.969 --> 04:49.402
Maybe you could...

04:52.049 --> 04:53.084
Now?

04:55.529 --> 04:58.726
- Leo?
- It's okay.

04:58.929 --> 05:01.523
You go, there's actually something
I have to take care of so...

05:01.689 --> 05:04.123
Well, we really need to talk
about things, you know.

05:04.289 --> 05:06.200
About where we stand.

05:07.129 --> 05:08.403
Yeah, we do.

05:10.609 --> 05:11.644
Rain check?

05:13.569 --> 05:15.127
It's what we do best.

05:20.769 --> 05:23.158
I hate when he does that.

05:34.249 --> 05:36.444
- So, what did he want?
- He cancelled our date.

05:36.609 --> 05:38.042
He's working again.

05:38.209 --> 05:40.086
You didn't ask him
what we should do?

05:40.249 --> 05:41.602
He had to fly, literally.

05:41.769 --> 05:44.329
The pages were doing
that flipping thing on their own again.

05:45.529 --> 05:47.247
It's a spell to take us to the future.

05:47.409 --> 05:49.877
Two, actually. One to send us
and one to bring us home.

05:50.049 --> 05:53.758
But apparently we only get one shot.
Once we use it, they disappear.

05:53.929 --> 05:57.046
Wait a minute, you guys.
We almost died going back to the past.

05:57.209 --> 05:59.200
This is not something
that you just do.

05:59.649 --> 06:03.039
- We're talking about your life, Phoebe.
- And I'm talking about yours, Prue.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.963
I'm just saying I think we should
think this over a little bit.

06:06.329 --> 06:09.127
Look, you had that premonition
today for a reason.

06:09.289 --> 06:11.598
It must mean that we're supposed
to do something about it.

06:11.929 --> 06:14.045
Going to the future might be
the only way to find out

06:14.209 --> 06:15.927
what you did to put you
on that pyre.

06:16.089 --> 06:17.727
How do you know
it's something that I did?

06:17.889 --> 06:20.403
It might be a demon
or a warlock that puts me there.

06:21.169 --> 06:22.761
Do you really wanna wait
to find out?

06:26.209 --> 06:29.838
Okay, pack your bags. We go,
try and figure out what happened,

06:30.009 --> 06:32.398
and hopefully come back
with enough information to stop it.

06:32.569 --> 06:34.924
We're gonna need a date, Phoebe.

06:36.169 --> 06:39.002
February 12th, 2009.

06:39.169 --> 06:41.603
That's two weeks before the date
I saw in my premonition.

06:41.849 --> 06:43.441
That should give us
more than enough time

06:43.609 --> 06:45.406
to figure out what put you there.

06:46.089 --> 06:47.317
I wonder how I look.

06:47.969 --> 06:50.119
Piper, you look great.
This is hardly the time to...

06:50.289 --> 06:52.803
Not now. In the future.

06:52.969 --> 06:55.278
When we went back to the '70s,
we saw ourselves as kids.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.838
Now we'll be seeing ourselves
walking around ten years older.

06:58.049 --> 07:00.563
All the vanquishing,
think of the wear and tear.

07:00.729 --> 07:02.481
Okay.

07:04.289 --> 07:06.678
Hear these words
Hear the rhyme

07:06.849 --> 07:09.238
We send to you this burning sign

07:09.449 --> 07:14.648
- Then our future selves we'll find
- In another place and time

07:39.649 --> 07:41.924
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

07:44.769 --> 07:47.488
You... I think you
have the wrong house.

07:48.049 --> 07:51.280
- Certainly the wrong mommy.
- Stop fooling.

07:52.369 --> 07:54.325
Car pool.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.600
Phoebe. Where's the volume?

08:11.769 --> 08:12.884
Command recognized.

08:13.049 --> 08:15.483
And more news on the execution
of Phoebe Halliwell

08:15.649 --> 08:17.002
coming up in just a moment.

08:17.169 --> 08:19.399
Now back to your regularly
scheduled programming,

08:19.569 --> 08:22.402
MTV's Real World 18, on the moon.

08:22.569 --> 08:26.084
- Mom, I'm gonna be late.
- Okay.

08:26.969 --> 08:30.518
- TV, shut up. Mute. Something.
- Command recognized.

08:32.328 --> 08:35.287
- Morning, Piper. You all right?
- I guess.

08:35.889 --> 08:39.404
Yeah, it's... With your sister,
it's rough, I know.

08:39.568 --> 08:43.642
Don't worry about your little one. I'll get
her from school like you asked,

08:43.808 --> 08:46.607
but you sure you want me
to take her to your ex's?

08:46.769 --> 08:50.045
"Ex"? As in husband? As in mine?

08:50.769 --> 08:53.966
Yes. Yes.
If that is what I told you, then yes.

08:55.169 --> 08:57.080
So you and he
are getting along better now?

08:57.849 --> 09:00.966
Maybe. Prue? Prue?

09:01.129 --> 09:03.484
Okay, kiddo, let's hit the road.

09:08.529 --> 09:12.283
Don't worry, Mommy,
I promise I'll do as you ask.

09:12.449 --> 09:15.725
I won't use my magic again, ever.

09:48.409 --> 09:53.403
Hey, hey, hey, people. Okay, enough.
People, stop touching me.

09:54.329 --> 09:58.322
Stay. Stay.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.407
- Prue, what's going on?
- I don't know.

10:01.569 --> 10:03.321
But I could get used to it.
Check me out.

10:03.489 --> 10:05.559
I don't just work at Buckland's,
I own it.

10:05.889 --> 10:08.528
And three more:
Paris, Tokyo and London.

10:09.089 --> 10:10.408
And you're blond.

10:11.369 --> 10:12.518
Yeah, strange.

10:12.889 --> 10:15.449
Wait, you had time
to go to work already?

10:15.609 --> 10:18.203
Well, actually, I woke up there.
But it was amazing.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.519
I had all these assistants
and this huge office.

10:20.689 --> 10:22.919
And I have a chauffeur,
and he is so totally hot.

10:25.289 --> 10:27.120
How'd you do?

10:28.489 --> 10:30.844
Is that a good thing or...?

10:31.009 --> 10:34.126
Well, if you ignore
my apparently failed marriage,

10:34.289 --> 10:36.120
the fact that I'm still living
in the manor...

10:36.289 --> 10:38.200
Wait. You're married?

10:38.489 --> 10:41.561
- Was. My daughter is on her way...
- Wait.

10:41.729 --> 10:43.162
Stop right there.
You have a daughter?

10:43.889 --> 10:47.768
Yeah. And she's... She's beautiful.

10:47.929 --> 10:49.647
Of course she is.

10:49.889 --> 10:50.924
What's her name?

10:51.609 --> 10:55.488
Oh, God. I don't know.
But, Prue, she has powers.

10:55.649 --> 10:59.005
But for some reason I told her
not to use them. Why would I do that?

10:59.169 --> 11:03.606
Speaking of why,
why are we in our future bodies?

11:03.809 --> 11:06.562
I mean, I thought that we were just
supposed to come here and see them.

11:06.729 --> 11:08.401
Well, apparently going to the past

11:08.569 --> 11:10.048
isn't the same as going to the future.

11:10.409 --> 11:12.639
I just wish that since
we are in our future bodies

11:12.809 --> 11:14.128
we could remember
what's happened

11:14.289 --> 11:16.484
in the last ten years,
like how I got a daughter.

11:16.649 --> 11:19.800
Okay, wait a second.
If I'm in my future body,

11:19.969 --> 11:21.960
and you are in your future body,

11:22.129 --> 11:23.608
then that means that Phoebe...

11:25.249 --> 11:28.002
- Oh, TV. Louder. Louder.
- Command recognized.

11:28.169 --> 11:30.763
- Execution. We're less than
eight hours away now

11:30.929 --> 11:32.647
until the burning of Phoebe Halliwell,

11:32.809 --> 11:35.721
the witch accused of murdering
Cal Greene six months ago.

11:35.889 --> 11:38.483
Eight hours? We were supposed
to be here two weeks before.

11:39.729 --> 11:43.039
Let's go there now, live, where
Sierra Stone is standing by. Sierra?

11:43.209 --> 11:45.518
San Francisco district attorney
Nathanial Pratt,

11:45.689 --> 11:47.486
whose discovery of the witch
last August

11:47.649 --> 11:49.799
has made him an early favourite
for the governor's seat,

11:49.969 --> 11:52.324
just came out to make a statement.
Let's listen in.

11:52.489 --> 11:57.119
This is a reflection of our citizens'
resolve to ferret out the hidden evil,

11:57.529 --> 12:02.603
to turn fear into fight,
and to band together as one.

12:02.769 --> 12:05.841
To cleanse our city
of its greatest threat.

12:06.209 --> 12:10.964
Tonight, Phoebe Halliwell
will burn for her crime.

12:11.129 --> 12:15.805
And when she does, let that be
a warning to other witches out there.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.288
You're next.

12:30.969 --> 12:33.767
Oh, surprise.
Here we go up the stairs,

12:33.929 --> 12:35.681
into the attic,
grabbing the Book of Shadows.

12:35.849 --> 12:38.727
Please tell me we're still not
gonna be doing this in ten years.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.800
- Apparently not.
- What?

12:40.969 --> 12:42.687
- The book is gone.
- It's got to be here.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.919
We need it to find the return spell.

12:45.089 --> 12:47.284
- Prue...
- Piper, just help me look for it.

12:47.449 --> 12:50.327
- Okay, relax. We'll find it.
- You don't know that.

12:50.489 --> 12:52.639
I mean, what if it's lost?
What if we can't find it?

12:52.809 --> 12:55.801
Then we're stuck in our future bodies
with no way of getting out of them

12:55.969 --> 12:57.243
and no way of saving Phoebe.

13:04.289 --> 13:07.406
- Been working out?
- Well, I guess that's a little sample

13:07.569 --> 13:09.207
of what ten years does to our powers.

13:09.369 --> 13:11.007
And to our attic.

13:16.009 --> 13:17.567
A key.

13:21.769 --> 13:23.839
It's the key to my wall safe
at Buckland's.

13:24.289 --> 13:25.802
Do you think that means it's there?

13:25.969 --> 13:28.005
We've never taken the book
out of the house before.

13:28.169 --> 13:30.603
Yeah, we haven't, but maybe
our future selves have.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.442
- The question is why.
- We don't even know what we're like

13:33.609 --> 13:35.361
in this time period,
let alone what we think.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.447
But if the book is at Buckland's,
maybe it will give us some answers.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.088
All right, then we go there first.

13:40.249 --> 13:42.638
Then to Phoebe to see
if she's all right.

13:42.809 --> 13:44.367
Sorry about the mess.

13:49.289 --> 13:50.642
Hello.

13:52.649 --> 13:54.526
Hello.

13:54.689 --> 13:57.761
Could somebody
please answer me?

13:57.929 --> 14:00.443
I really need to talk to someone.

14:02.409 --> 14:07.563
Okay. How about a snack?
Maybe some crackers, peanuts?

14:08.169 --> 14:09.568
Something?

14:12.929 --> 14:16.080
A tray full of goo?
Hey, wait a minute...

14:21.329 --> 14:25.481
- Don't I even get a phone call?
- Shut up, witch.

14:32.169 --> 14:34.558
I can't believe you get a limo
and a driver,

14:34.729 --> 14:37.562
- and I've still got my same old car.
- You have a husband.

14:37.729 --> 14:40.641
Had a husband, you mean.
I'm getting divorced, remember?

14:40.809 --> 14:43.528
And how do you know
you don't have a guy in this time?

14:43.689 --> 14:46.999
I mean, after all, I have a kid
and an ex, you could have several.

14:47.169 --> 14:49.125
- Ex's?
- No, kids.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.361
I mean, we're in the future but with
no memory of the past ten years.

14:52.529 --> 14:54.247
I don't even know
who my ex-husband...

15:03.089 --> 15:06.604
Okay, apparently my power isn't
the only one that's grown.

15:06.809 --> 15:09.198
- You just froze...
- Everything.

15:09.369 --> 15:12.566
- What a difference a decade makes.
- What the hell are you doing?

15:13.049 --> 15:15.643
Leo, I'm so glad you're here,
I have so many...

15:16.609 --> 15:17.837
What's wrong?

15:18.009 --> 15:19.920
I knew you'd do
something stupid like this.

15:20.369 --> 15:22.678
You used your magic in public?
What's the matter with you?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.527
- Are you insane?
- Leo...

15:24.689 --> 15:26.361
Remember, he thinks
we know what's going on.

15:26.529 --> 15:27.962
You want to end up like your sister?

15:28.129 --> 15:30.040
We had an agreement,
no magic for Melinda's sake.

15:30.449 --> 15:32.963
- Melinda?
- Our daughter. What's wrong?

15:33.129 --> 15:36.485
- Our daughter?
- Wait a second. You're Piper's ex?

15:40.929 --> 15:42.601
Witch!

15:42.769 --> 15:45.329
- Okay, what is going on here?
- Prue.

15:46.689 --> 15:50.762
Over there. Witch! Witch!

15:50.929 --> 15:53.124
Hurry, we gotta get
out of here before they see you.

15:53.289 --> 15:55.280
- "They"?
- The witch hunters.

16:05.889 --> 16:08.005
Prue? Piper?

16:08.169 --> 16:11.479
They haven't been to visit you before.
Why would they come now?

16:12.689 --> 16:14.407
No...

16:14.569 --> 16:17.402
...they're going to be as happy
to get rid of you as I am.

16:18.009 --> 16:19.044
Who are you?

16:20.089 --> 16:23.126
I'm sorry, it's been so long
since our last visit.

16:23.289 --> 16:27.567
Executions are a bitch to plan.
Logistics, alerting the media,

16:27.729 --> 16:28.923
gathering the kindling.

16:34.529 --> 16:37.601
You know, I've had a lot of time

16:37.889 --> 16:40.926
to do some thinking about...

16:41.409 --> 16:44.367
...why I'm here.
- Well...

16:44.529 --> 16:46.838
...no amount of thinking
will change the outcome.

16:47.009 --> 16:49.204
Justice will be served
for your crime.

16:49.369 --> 16:52.122
But it wasn't really
a big crime, was it?

16:52.529 --> 16:54.121
You are truly evil.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.244
What bigger crime is there
than taking a man's life?

17:08.009 --> 17:09.237
I killed someone?

17:10.888 --> 17:15.838
Phoebe, what is this? An attempt
to stay your execution? Plead insanity?

17:16.648 --> 17:18.401
It won't work.

17:18.569 --> 17:23.926
- You have five hours to live.
- What? Five hours?

17:24.089 --> 17:25.442
But that's not possible.

17:26.209 --> 17:27.642
Well...

17:28.689 --> 17:32.807
...l'm happy to see the seriousness
of your crime has finally hit you.

17:34.689 --> 17:36.281
See...

17:36.769 --> 17:41.240
...you represent everything I abhor.
You're a threat.

17:41.409 --> 17:44.640
A danger to everything that is good
and pure in our world.

17:45.369 --> 17:47.041
You're talking out of fear.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.527
Just because you don't understand
something doesn't make it evil.

17:50.689 --> 17:52.407
No, it's you
who doesn't understand.

17:52.569 --> 17:53.922
You killed a man using your power,

17:54.089 --> 17:55.920
and now you're gonna die
because of it.

17:56.089 --> 17:58.967
I only wish that I could burn
all of your kind with you.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.164
But don't worry...

18:05.449 --> 18:07.883
...in time I will.

18:08.049 --> 18:09.562
This is only the beginning.

18:21.449 --> 18:22.723
Leo, listen to me.

18:22.889 --> 18:25.528
The two of us, the Prue and Piper
that you see before you,

18:25.689 --> 18:28.283
are from the past.
From ten years ago.

18:28.569 --> 18:32.608
- So we have no idea what is going on.
- Don't even lie to me.

18:32.769 --> 18:34.248
All right, Phoebe is set to die today,

18:34.409 --> 18:36.923
and I only hope that this madness
dies with her.

18:37.089 --> 18:40.206
All right, these people are in danger
because of the witch trials she started.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.405
How? How did she start them?

18:42.569 --> 18:44.480
You know, I don't know
what you hope to accomplish

18:44.649 --> 18:46.640
by pretending not to know.

18:55.289 --> 18:57.086
You haven't kissed me
like that since...

18:57.249 --> 19:00.798
Since this morning, 1999, remember?
We were supposed to meet,

19:00.969 --> 19:04.006
you had to leave, I went up to the attic
and this is where I came. The future.

19:04.169 --> 19:07.525
If you don't believe me, at least
believe what you feel. Trust that.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.766
I remember.

19:13.929 --> 19:15.408
That day they sent me
to the attic

19:15.569 --> 19:17.400
to open the Book of Shadows
to the future spell.

19:17.569 --> 19:19.639
Wait, that was you?
We just assumed that it was Grams.

19:19.809 --> 19:21.481
No, it was me.

19:21.649 --> 19:22.923
But they didn't tell me why.

19:23.649 --> 19:27.119
Wait, you don't know what's happened
the last ten years? Any of it?

19:28.969 --> 19:30.880
These people...

19:31.409 --> 19:32.558
They're here underground

19:32.729 --> 19:35.527
because they've been
accused of practicing witchcraft.

19:36.129 --> 19:38.006
- They're witches?
- Some of them.

19:39.409 --> 19:41.559
Most of them
have been falsely accused.

19:42.049 --> 19:43.562
But they're safe here for now.

19:44.089 --> 19:48.082
- What did Phoebe do?
- Six months ago, she...

19:49.249 --> 19:52.002
...killed a man, Cal Greene.

19:53.009 --> 19:54.362
The baseball player?

19:55.849 --> 19:59.364
No, this is crazy. I mean Phoebe
would never hurt anyone.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.281
She hurt him.

20:01.449 --> 20:02.882
Because he murdered someone.

20:03.049 --> 20:05.040
Someone Phoebe cared about
very much.

20:05.209 --> 20:07.928
A dear friend who he brutalized.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.038
But a technicality set him free.

20:11.529 --> 20:14.965
Phoebe was furious, outraged.

20:15.129 --> 20:16.562
And that's when she crossed
the line

20:16.729 --> 20:18.879
from protecting the innocent
to punishing the guilty.

20:19.049 --> 20:21.961
She used her power to kill Greene,
got caught,

20:22.169 --> 20:24.080
and her magic exposed
by Nathanial Pratt.

20:24.889 --> 20:28.245
And this is the result, modern-day
witch trials with Pratt at the helm?

20:28.809 --> 20:32.119
And Phoebe at the stake,
I don't buy it. Her power can't kill.

20:32.289 --> 20:35.884
Well, it can now. It's been ten years,
all your powers have grown.

20:36.049 --> 20:38.847
- We have to get to Phoebe to explain.
- You can't.

20:39.009 --> 20:41.239
All right, as it stands,
you and Prue are safe.

20:41.409 --> 20:44.162
Pratt checked you out, and he
doesn't suspect that you're witches.

20:44.329 --> 20:46.285
To get to Phoebe,
you'd have to use your powers.

20:46.449 --> 20:48.326
And they'll catch you,
then they'll kill you.

20:48.489 --> 20:50.923
Leo, she's our sister,
we're not gonna let her die.

20:53.609 --> 20:55.008
Wait. I'll go.

20:55.249 --> 20:58.878
- Leo, this is our sister, we have to.
- No.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.200
I'm still your guide. I can orb in
and keep you out of danger.

21:03.169 --> 21:04.522
Then we'll go back to Buckland's

21:04.689 --> 21:06.645
and get the book
and get the spell to send us home.

21:06.809 --> 21:08.527
We'll meet you at the manor.

21:11.089 --> 21:12.807
Leo...

21:14.649 --> 21:16.924
We got married?

21:17.089 --> 21:20.525
Piper, later.
There'll be plenty of time later.

21:32.289 --> 21:35.406
Oh, Miss Halliwell.
Can you sign the PO for the new...?

21:35.729 --> 21:38.084
People, give the woman some air.

21:38.249 --> 21:42.322
She will meet with all of you
after lunch. Thank you.

21:45.329 --> 21:47.524
Okay, good news first.

21:47.689 --> 21:50.487
The acquisition paperwork
was approved and...

21:52.009 --> 21:54.045
- Yes?
- I'm with her.

21:55.169 --> 21:56.841
It's Piper.

21:57.569 --> 21:58.763
My sister?

21:59.529 --> 22:01.565
Oh, right, sorry.

22:01.729 --> 22:05.039
Almost forgot you had another one.
I mean, other than...

22:05.569 --> 22:07.002
That's okay, I forgot your name too.

22:07.169 --> 22:09.729
Anne, Miss Halliwell's
personal assistant.

22:10.569 --> 22:15.404
Anne, right. My personal assistant.
By the way, Anne...

22:16.929 --> 22:20.604
...do you know if my husband
called by any chance?

22:22.009 --> 22:25.922
Husband, good one. Very funny.
Like you have the time.

22:26.089 --> 22:29.126
Okay, I just need to get
your final okay on the acquisition.

22:29.289 --> 22:31.484
Your sister was amazing.

22:31.649 --> 22:33.879
I mean at first the board
was a little resistant,

22:34.049 --> 22:37.837
what with the layoffs it would entail,
but Prue pushed it through.

22:38.129 --> 22:39.244
I did?

22:39.409 --> 22:41.400
I thought the "to hell
with the little people" part

22:41.569 --> 22:45.721
- was particularly persuasive.
- Oh, okay. Anne, sweetie,

22:45.889 --> 22:48.642
I really need some private time
with my sister so if you can just...

22:48.809 --> 22:52.119
- No problem, just buzz me.
- Look at me.

22:52.289 --> 22:55.201
All right, I am booked with work,
I am about to lay off

22:55.369 --> 22:59.408
countless people with a flick
of my pen, no man to speak of...

22:59.569 --> 23:01.207
Maybe you're just picky.

23:01.969 --> 23:03.482
What's happened to me?

23:04.809 --> 23:09.246
Okay, well, I could dwell
on the nightmare my life will become,

23:09.409 --> 23:10.762
but we have work to do.

23:10.929 --> 23:13.523
At least some things around here
haven't changed.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.318
Okay, it should be after
the demon with the tusk

23:20.489 --> 23:22.480
and before the spell
to discourage a lover.

23:25.049 --> 23:29.759
- Where is it? It was here in l999.
- Yeah, and now it's gone.

23:29.929 --> 23:32.204
So if the spell
can only be used once

23:32.369 --> 23:34.963
that must mean that our future selves
have already used it.

23:35.129 --> 23:39.327
- Which means...
- We have no way of getting home.

23:46.329 --> 23:50.561
Leo. Oh, thank God. Look, I know
what they think I did, and if we just...

23:50.729 --> 23:52.606
They'll hear you.

23:52.769 --> 23:55.078
Where's the rest of the cavalry?

23:55.249 --> 23:56.238
They're not coming.

23:57.009 --> 24:00.160
So, what, you'll grab me
and we'll just orb out or whatever,

24:00.329 --> 24:03.207
- and we'll meet them back at the...
- Look, Phoebe...

24:03.369 --> 24:04.484
I'm so sorry.

24:05.369 --> 24:06.484
For what?

24:07.809 --> 24:10.039
Did something happen to my sisters?

24:10.689 --> 24:12.327
Nobody's gonna rescue you.

24:17.609 --> 24:20.442
If that is some kind
of whitelighter humour,

24:20.609 --> 24:23.726
let me be the first to tell you, you
are not a very funny race of people.

24:24.809 --> 24:28.802
You know, I wish you remember
what you've done.

24:28.969 --> 24:31.437
It would make this so much easier.

24:35.929 --> 24:39.080
Your future self used witchcraft
for vengeance, Phoebe.

24:39.249 --> 24:41.558
Pratt is using that as a platform.

24:41.729 --> 24:44.243
Why does everyone think
that I killed someone?

24:44.809 --> 24:46.162
I wouldn't.

24:46.329 --> 24:49.719
I mean, I couldn't. What did I do,
premonition the man to death?

24:49.889 --> 24:52.608
- My power is passive.
- Not in the future.

24:53.009 --> 24:56.558
It's grown. It's changed.
As have you.

24:57.129 --> 25:00.485
Which means, unfortunately,
you have to suffer the consequences.

25:01.449 --> 25:03.041
No.

25:03.529 --> 25:04.882
I don't believe it.

25:05.929 --> 25:07.567
Then believe what you see.

25:27.449 --> 25:29.565
Oh, my God.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.403
What have I done?

25:32.969 --> 25:34.561
Leo?

25:35.409 --> 25:37.559
Help me!

25:49.529 --> 25:51.918
You wanna tell me again
exactly how screwed we are?

25:52.089 --> 25:54.557
- Pretty screwed.
- Thanks.

25:54.929 --> 25:58.558
- I wonder what's taking Leo so long.
- You know...

25:59.969 --> 26:02.642
...some of these pages are marked.

26:03.249 --> 26:07.401
The top corners are turned down,
and all of them are new spells.

26:07.569 --> 26:09.127
Such as?

26:09.289 --> 26:11.962
Like, here's a spell to create a door.

26:12.489 --> 26:16.277
One to induce slumber, a glamour
to change one's appearance.

26:17.689 --> 26:19.998
Some of them have
these little baggies attached.

26:20.169 --> 26:22.558
Those must be potions
of some kind.

26:23.809 --> 26:27.085
But what about these?
I mean, there's...

26:27.249 --> 26:29.080
Okay, one to create money,

26:29.889 --> 26:34.883
to bend someone's will,
to erase a memory, a binding spell.

26:35.049 --> 26:37.005
Binding? What are all these
marked for?

26:37.329 --> 26:40.127
This must have been
our future selves' plan.

26:40.289 --> 26:41.881
Here's a prison map.

26:42.049 --> 26:45.086
We were gonna use all of this
to break Phoebe out.

26:45.249 --> 26:47.046
But something is bothering me.
I mean, clearly,

26:47.209 --> 26:49.643
some of these spells
are for personal gain.

26:50.049 --> 26:53.121
Which would break the most basic
of Wiccan rules. We wouldn't do that.

26:53.289 --> 26:54.802
We wouldn't.

26:54.969 --> 26:58.200
But maybe in ten years
our future selves would for Phoebe.

27:00.449 --> 27:02.804
Perfect timing, we found the book,
but we can't...

27:02.969 --> 27:04.368
- Where's Phoebe?
- Where is she?

27:04.529 --> 27:06.838
In prison where she belongs.

27:07.129 --> 27:09.324
Leo, you were supposed
to bring her back here.

27:09.489 --> 27:11.605
No, I said I'd go to her.

27:11.809 --> 27:14.721
And I did, to explain to her
why she has to pay for her crime.

27:14.929 --> 27:16.806
You're our guide,
you're supposed to protect us,

27:16.969 --> 27:19.358
- and you're just gonna let her die?
- You're signing her death warrant.

27:19.529 --> 27:23.408
I am trying to protect the greater good.
All right, if Phoebe lives,

27:23.569 --> 27:27.198
if you use your magic to save her,
then the persecutions will continue.

27:28.049 --> 27:30.722
And our daughter will grow
into a world where her power

27:30.889 --> 27:32.766
is punishable by death.
Do you want that?

27:32.929 --> 27:35.887
- Of course not.
- Well, then it has to end with Phoebe.

27:36.209 --> 27:38.803
- She has to die.
- Like hell.

27:40.529 --> 27:41.848
Prue, relax.

27:42.009 --> 27:44.728
We've seen what your new powers
can do when you're angry.

27:45.609 --> 27:47.406
He's gonna stay frozen, right?

27:48.289 --> 27:50.928
If he knows what's good for him,
he'll stay frozen.

27:51.089 --> 27:52.568
All right, let's get these spells.

28:00.449 --> 28:05.762
Now, some people
say this is a victory for me,

28:05.929 --> 28:10.684
but I say it is a victory for us all.
For today,

28:10.889 --> 28:15.804
a blight on everything that is good
in our world will be extinguished.

28:17.129 --> 28:21.919
Tonight, the witch will burn!

28:28.129 --> 28:30.245
Piper, if you're gonna do this,
you better hurry.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.479
Leo can unfreeze and be home
any second.

28:33.009 --> 28:34.840
Besides, Phoebe has less
than an hour.

29:10.889 --> 29:13.119
Can't do it, can you?

29:14.449 --> 29:15.962
No.

29:16.569 --> 29:19.641
Our grandmother did it to us
for protection.

29:21.129 --> 29:24.246
You don't have to bind
her powers, Piper.

29:24.449 --> 29:28.158
We agreed that I'd take care of her,
and I will, I promise.

29:28.729 --> 29:30.765
I know you will.

29:32.209 --> 29:34.200
So we were together.

29:34.369 --> 29:37.202
Does that mean you clipped
your wings for me?

29:39.009 --> 29:40.522
No.

29:41.409 --> 29:43.400
You wouldn't let me.

29:44.729 --> 29:46.401
We...

29:46.969 --> 29:50.678
...tried to make it work
with our powers.

29:51.489 --> 29:54.208
But it didn't, and then this
all happened, and...

29:56.929 --> 30:01.161
Were we happy?
Just for a little while, were we happy?

30:03.929 --> 30:05.601
Very.

30:16.169 --> 30:18.319
Are you gonna try and stop us?

30:19.809 --> 30:21.208
I can't do that.

30:23.249 --> 30:26.400
Then I hope you understand
why I have to do what I'm doing.

30:28.609 --> 30:29.883
Yeah.

30:31.369 --> 30:33.087
What are we gonna do?

30:38.369 --> 30:40.246
What we always do.

30:41.529 --> 30:43.087
Talk about it later.

31:04.489 --> 31:06.127
What is it? What's wrong?

31:07.049 --> 31:08.801
I have no one to say goodbye to.

31:09.849 --> 31:11.601
No life.

31:12.129 --> 31:15.724
They didn't even know who you were
at the office, my own sister.

31:17.529 --> 31:19.406
If we die tonight,
my tombstone will read,

31:19.609 --> 31:21.804
"Here lies Prue. She worked hard."

31:22.409 --> 31:24.047
We're not gonna die.

31:24.209 --> 31:26.200
We're gonna find a way
back to the present,

31:26.409 --> 31:28.320
and we'll create a new future.

31:28.529 --> 31:30.963
What if we can't?
What if we can never get home?

31:31.169 --> 31:32.966
According to Phoebe's premonition,
we fail.

31:34.049 --> 31:37.121
Our future selves fail.
We've still got a shot.

31:38.889 --> 31:42.279
You're right. You're right.

31:42.449 --> 31:45.202
All right, let's go get Phoebe.

31:54.969 --> 31:56.846
So far, so good.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.240
Don't people normally
break out of prison?

32:00.449 --> 32:02.280
Nothing about this is normal.

32:04.889 --> 32:08.768
"To create a door."
Okay, but where?

32:08.969 --> 32:11.358
- No place like here.
- Okay.

32:16.409 --> 32:18.400
Kind of small for us, don't you think?

32:18.609 --> 32:22.284
When you find your path is blocked
All you have to do is knock

32:41.489 --> 32:43.844
- Freeze.
- Good idea.

32:44.969 --> 32:46.402
All right.

32:46.809 --> 32:49.607
Her cell should be
up those stairs. Come on.

32:54.689 --> 32:56.441
She'll be guarded.
Are we ready for this?

32:56.649 --> 32:58.480
Do we have a choice?

33:02.609 --> 33:04.486
We're too late.

33:47.809 --> 33:49.925
I love the smell of burnt witch
in the morning.

33:51.169 --> 33:53.842
At least I'm paying for my crime.

33:54.529 --> 33:56.963
There'll come a day
when you'll have to pay for yours too.

33:59.129 --> 34:01.120
Remorseless to the end, huh?

34:06.609 --> 34:11.205
Let today be a lesson to all those
who would seek to defy human nature

34:11.369 --> 34:12.484
with their way of life.

34:12.688 --> 34:14.565
Let today serve notice

34:14.768 --> 34:17.726
that black magic will not be tolerated
in our society.

34:17.929 --> 34:22.286
And let today be remembered
as the day we burned the witch!

34:24.248 --> 34:26.080
Piper, freeze him.

34:26.929 --> 34:28.442
Prue, Piper.

34:28.609 --> 34:32.158
- Come on, we're getting out of here.
- No, wait. You can't.

34:32.369 --> 34:34.724
- Prue, I'm serious.
- What are you talking about?

34:34.929 --> 34:39.366
You guys have to leave.
I deserve to be here.

34:39.569 --> 34:42.447
Or my future self does.

34:42.649 --> 34:45.402
But you killed a killer.
Don't be ridiculous.

34:45.609 --> 34:50.808
Look, this is Pratt's personal crusade.
This isn't about us, it is about him.

34:51.009 --> 34:53.125
Wherever we go, he will follow us.

34:53.489 --> 34:56.161
He will hunt us,
he will hunt our families.

34:56.369 --> 34:58.724
If anybody should be punished,
it should be him.

35:00.929 --> 35:03.443
- Prue, what are you doing?
- Saving the future good witches

35:03.609 --> 35:06.123
- and our future.
- Prue, wait.

35:06.889 --> 35:10.199
Don't. Don't become a murderer too.

35:10.889 --> 35:12.641
It has to end with me.

35:14.729 --> 35:17.323
Phoebe, he was evil,
he deserved what...

35:17.489 --> 35:20.447
The wrong thing done for
the right reason is still the wrong thing.

35:22.409 --> 35:28.166
Our job is to protect the innocent,
not punish the guilty.

35:28.369 --> 35:32.999
And I crossed that line,
and I know that.

35:34.489 --> 35:36.923
And now you guys
have to know that too.

35:40.689 --> 35:42.281
We are not leaving here without you.

35:48.409 --> 35:50.798
Prue, we were sent here
for a reason.

35:51.329 --> 35:54.048
Maybe not to stop this
like what we thought,

35:55.049 --> 35:58.928
but maybe to understand
why this has to happen.

36:03.009 --> 36:05.125
Why you have to let this happen.

36:08.129 --> 36:09.528
I don't want to die.

36:10.529 --> 36:13.885
But I don't want you to die
because of me.

36:28.009 --> 36:29.124
I love you.

37:22.969 --> 37:24.482
Prue.

37:27.129 --> 37:29.085
What are we doing here?

37:29.289 --> 37:31.007
Phoebe?

37:32.329 --> 37:35.207
You don't think she was...?
I mean, we saw...

37:35.409 --> 37:39.482
I know. I know. Oh, please, God,
don't let it be true. Phoebe.

37:48.649 --> 37:50.401
We thought that we had lost you.

37:51.449 --> 37:53.121
You did.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.481
I was burning.

37:57.049 --> 38:02.840
And I could... I could feel
the flames on my skin.

38:03.049 --> 38:06.200
And then l... I was here.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.842
I don't know what happened.

38:08.369 --> 38:11.042
It's okay, you're safe now,
you're home.

38:11.249 --> 38:13.399
Yeah, home, but when?

38:15.209 --> 38:18.121
And Cal Greene tied a record
by smashing his sixth grand slam

38:18.329 --> 38:21.321
- of the year today, making...
- Wait, that's the baseball player.

38:21.889 --> 38:23.880
That's what triggered
my premonition.

38:24.089 --> 38:25.841
We're back where we started.

38:26.049 --> 38:27.528
The day we cast the spell.

38:28.249 --> 38:29.364
Why?

38:29.929 --> 38:31.328
Maybe because it worked.

38:31.529 --> 38:34.202
We were sent into the future
to find out what Phoebe did.

38:34.409 --> 38:37.242
Maybe we came back
to stop it from happening.

38:37.729 --> 38:40.926
But we didn't cast a spell to come
back. We didn't even have one.

38:41.409 --> 38:43.001
Maybe they sent us back.

38:43.409 --> 38:45.445
But who? And why today?

38:45.609 --> 38:47.725
If we were sent back to keep
the future from happening,

38:47.929 --> 38:51.888
shouldn't we have been sent back
to the day Phoebe killed Cal Greene?

38:56.449 --> 38:57.438
Not again.

39:00.289 --> 39:02.405
This guy still hasn't learned
his lesson.

39:03.529 --> 39:05.724
Apparently, neither have we.

39:06.489 --> 39:08.525
I think this is why we
were sent back here,

39:08.689 --> 39:12.159
to this moment in time.
This is where it all started.

39:12.369 --> 39:14.758
The first time we used
our magic for revenge.

39:15.489 --> 39:18.686
But it's just a little thing,
it's harmless.

39:18.849 --> 39:20.441
Yeah, but once you break
the small rules,

39:20.609 --> 39:23.840
it's just a matter of time
before the big ones are next.

39:24.369 --> 39:25.882
A very smart girl once told me

39:26.049 --> 39:29.644
that we're supposed to protect
the innocent, not punish the guilty.

39:30.009 --> 39:31.727
I haven't told you yet.

39:33.449 --> 39:34.882
Now maybe you won't have to.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.281
Pratt.

39:48.849 --> 39:51.079
- Do you think we should follow?
- No.

39:51.569 --> 39:54.163
Our little act of revenge
might have been what sent Pratt

39:54.329 --> 39:55.603
on his path to seek his own.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.602
Which might have led him to start
the future witch trials.

39:58.769 --> 40:00.760
Hopefully now he won't.

40:00.929 --> 40:03.602
I still think we should keep an eye
on him, just in case.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.805
Absolutely.

40:07.889 --> 40:09.004
Hey, what's up?

40:09.369 --> 40:12.725
Not work. There is no way
I'm going to the office tonight.

40:12.889 --> 40:14.208
I'm going out with you guys.

40:14.369 --> 40:15.768
We all have a lot
of changes to make

40:15.929 --> 40:18.159
if we want to avoid ending up
where we just came from.

40:18.329 --> 40:19.603
Hey, the future wasn't all bad,

40:19.769 --> 40:23.205
you were like Miss Fortune 500.
And I had a beautiful little girl.

40:23.729 --> 40:26.084
- What?
- Details later.

40:26.289 --> 40:28.359
We can still make
the good things happen, Piper.

40:28.529 --> 40:30.838
We just have to make
the right choices.

40:31.289 --> 40:33.245
So maybe Leo and I
will end up together.

40:33.609 --> 40:35.964
Wait, you and Leo?

40:36.129 --> 40:37.960
Speak of the angel. I'll get that.

40:40.689 --> 40:42.202
Hey, stranger.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.768
I would have settled
for a nice hello.

40:53.929 --> 40:56.124
Didn't anybody
ever tell you not to settle?

40:56.369 --> 40:57.768
That's a good lesson.

40:58.329 --> 41:00.160
I've been learning
a lot of them lately.

41:00.489 --> 41:02.161
So I've heard.

41:04.169 --> 41:06.239
Honestly, I didn't know
you'd be sent to the future.

41:06.409 --> 41:08.525
I don't even know what happened
when you got there.

41:08.689 --> 41:11.487
All I was told is that apparently
you had something to learn.

41:12.769 --> 41:15.761
- So that's why you're here?
- No.

41:15.929 --> 41:17.157
That's why you're here.

41:17.889 --> 41:19.880
You three were given a glimpse
of your future

41:20.049 --> 41:21.402
to learn a valuable lesson.

41:22.209 --> 41:23.722
And I'm glad you learned it too,

41:23.889 --> 41:26.608
because they wouldn't have
brought you back if you hadn't.

41:26.769 --> 41:30.000
Speaking of which, they're making me
work tonight so I can't really...

41:30.169 --> 41:32.524
This is always gonna be
a problem for us, isn't it?

41:33.769 --> 41:35.566
I'm willing to work on it.

41:35.969 --> 41:38.767
Good. Don't ever forget
you said that.
