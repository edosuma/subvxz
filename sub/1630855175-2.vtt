WEBVTT

00:10.177 --> 00:11.929
Necrophilia Nancy 38.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.306
Me! Bingo!

00:15.641 --> 00:17.226
Nipple 32.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.896
<i>And a big boner four.</i>

00:22.147 --> 00:27.402
I am feeling horny for orgasm 69.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.697
I got it! 69! 69.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.492
I've got bingo. Bingo!

01:05.983 --> 01:08.277
Listen to me.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.989
You're beautiful.

01:12.698 --> 01:16.201
And you're strong,
and you're gonna outlive us all.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.955
Don't take any shit from anybody.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.125
Now go get 'em. Huh?

01:27.379 --> 01:29.423
Hey. What happened?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.841
- Hey, Milton.
- Hey, Peggy.

01:30.841 --> 01:34.052
What happened is you stole $3,000
from my safe, Peggy.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.555
Look at the footage.
Have you looked at the footage?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.432
It's broken.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.142
And what's that?

01:41.560 --> 01:44.062
- They left the rest.
- What is that, like two grand?

01:44.062 --> 01:46.481
- Fifteen hundred.
- Have you met me?

01:46.481 --> 01:49.318
You think I'd leave 1,500 bucks
on the table?

01:49.318 --> 01:52.654
And this animal who jacked your safe,
they weren't a pro.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.364
How'd they crack it?

01:54.865 --> 01:56.116
They used the combination.

01:56.617 --> 02:01.163
Well, I don't have the combination,
so I'm cleared.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.874
You're the one who comes in here
for the Keurig,

02:03.874 --> 02:06.418
which is against the rules by the way.

02:06.418 --> 02:09.213
So, nobody else sneaks in here
for the Keurig?

02:13.634 --> 02:14.843
Everybody uses the Keurig, Owen.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.303
What are you doing, Peggy?

02:16.929 --> 02:19.097
All right, we got 20 empty K-Cups here.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.350
I can't drink that much shitty coffee
in a week.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.144
Somebody knows the combo
to that safe, Owen.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.146
Nobody knows the combo.

02:26.146 --> 02:31.485
Unless, indulge me,
everybody knows the combo.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.403
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.821
I'm following a hunch here.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.367
I know the P-town alarm code.
What's the alarm code, Owen?

02:38.367 --> 02:40.202
This is the safe, Peggy.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.622
Everybody who opens or closes this place
knows the alarm code.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.873
So I wonder if--

02:46.375 --> 02:51.046
Two, 18, 50.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.717
It's the same as the alarm code.
What is it with this?

02:56.301 --> 02:58.387
It's my mother's birthday.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.681
What?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.558
It's my mother's birthday.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.353
So your mother's birthday is
the skeleton key for your entire life?

03:07.312 --> 03:10.566
Look, clean up your passwords
and get over your mother.

03:10.566 --> 03:11.859
She's not that into you.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.195
Come on, let me take the kid,
she's innocent.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.607
Pioneertown's security is
a real shit show,

03:51.607 --> 03:54.026
so that's the first job
that I'm bringing in,

03:54.026 --> 03:55.569
but that's chump change.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.030
But if this Picasso's what I think it is,
and it is,

03:58.030 --> 04:00.115
the finder's fee is one million.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.784
And if you think
I'm taking just 10% of that,

04:02.784 --> 04:05.871
- you're out of your mind.
- Look at this. Who does this?

04:05.871 --> 04:06.955
So listen,

04:06.955 --> 04:10.209
one, we get the reward.
Two, we get the press.

04:10.209 --> 04:13.128
Three,
we parlay that spotlight into huge jobs.

04:13.128 --> 04:17.048
So, we get into this guru's house,
we vet that fucking Picasso,

04:17.048 --> 04:19.927
and if it is the one from the Paris heist,
then we can--

04:19.927 --> 04:21.512
What are you doing?

04:21.512 --> 04:22.971
What am I doing?

04:22.971 --> 04:26.934
I'm trying to download
some new security software.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.854
I got my last big client coming tomorrow,
and if he doesn't think I'm up to speed,

04:30.854 --> 04:34.399
we're gonna be
working outta my car next week.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.777
Jesus.

04:42.241 --> 04:44.368
No, you don't chew enough. I've noticed.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.621
What about my plan, huh?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.707
Just plan on getting to class on time.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.168
The guy's doing us a favor.
Don't make me look bad.

04:53.168 --> 04:57.798
Come on, this fucking class?
After everything I've accomplished?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.217
It's been one week.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.761
Ten days. Plus, school's for morons.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.514
I'm already flying. You want me to crawl?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.349
Do you wanna be more than an intern?

05:07.349 --> 05:08.976
An unpaid associate.

05:08.976 --> 05:13.105
You got to learn the law,
learn what a PI can do, legally.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.357
How 'bout that, huh?
I'm not going to jail for you.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.986
- I could do this shit in my sleep.
- Wonderful. All right.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.279
Please.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.908
Okay, I already downloaded it,
you stupid fuck!

05:26.076 --> 05:27.327
That's it. Okay.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.672
Let's see.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.633
Yeah, that's something.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.598
Yes.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.562
Where is--

05:58.442 --> 06:04.698
Welcome to the Security Guard
and Private Investigator Training.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.492
Can I get your name?

06:09.203 --> 06:11.580
Let's just see how it goes first.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.214
To become a certified PI,

06:21.006 --> 06:24.593
you'll need 50 hours of training.

06:48.325 --> 06:52.120
Let's begin with the syllabus.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.758
Sorry, violent stomach issues. I'm sorry.

07:11.723 --> 07:15.018
I don't have 50 hours to spend
with Grandfather Time.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.813
That guy's remedial, I'm a prodigy.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.148
<i>Did you sign in, in the class?</i>

07:20.148 --> 07:21.525
No, I refused.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.111
So, he doesn't know
what Peggy Newman looks like.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.530
Anybody could be Peggy Newman.
I could be Peggy Newman.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.241
<i>I can sit there, I can take this class.</i>

07:29.241 --> 07:32.369
And then I can learn how to hack,
and then I can get into the databases

07:32.369 --> 07:34.121
and find out what
the government knows about me.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.205
<i>This is great.</i>

07:35.205 --> 07:37.416
And you can help me find
this fucking guru's house

07:37.416 --> 07:39.710
and maybe I can check out his Picasso.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.046
We're gonna kill it together.
I love you, Carol.

07:50.179 --> 07:54.016
Mommy! Hey, lady! Mommy!

07:55.100 --> 07:58.103
I just saw my mother, I swear to God.

07:58.103 --> 08:02.191
- <i>Carol, it was Roslyn.</i>
- Wait, you saw her in the casket, right?

08:02.191 --> 08:05.110
Yeah but, I'm telling you,
Mommy just got on the bus.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.656
Carol, do you hear me?

08:10.699 --> 08:12.284
Could I be dead right now?

08:12.284 --> 08:13.744
I can hear you.

08:15.454 --> 08:16.747
Are you dead with me?

08:18.540 --> 08:22.252
Hey! Are you seeing me right now?

08:23.253 --> 08:24.338
Yes or no?

08:25.422 --> 08:26.465
Wh--

08:26.465 --> 08:27.925
Okay, thank you.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.469
You know what,
I think I'm okay over here, yeah.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.846
That's weird, that was like
a acid flashback or something,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.972
but I get those all the time,
but this was different.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.726
Okay, I gotta get to rehearsal.

08:37.726 --> 08:42.356
Siobhan's always trying
to reinvent the cancan. Gotta go. Okay.

08:42.356 --> 08:46.527
All right, I know y'all are excited to get
to the cartwheel, but first, we twirl.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.737
And five, six, seven, eight,

08:48.737 --> 08:52.449
twirl, twirl. Get in line, good.

08:52.449 --> 08:59.748
Hop, hop, hop, kick. Hop, hop, hop, kick.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.501
Rehearsal's over, Peggy.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.503
I'll catch up.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.463
Well, we added a few twirls.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.215
- Easy.
- All right,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.133
let's take it from the top then, shall we?

09:10.133 --> 09:11.969
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.346
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.390
Get in line, Peggy.

09:16.390 --> 09:20.435
Hop, hop, hop, kick.
Hop, hop, not it, Peggy.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.146
- Hop, hop, hop, kick. And keep twirling.
- I got you.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.731
Peggy, okay.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.817
Good job, ladies.

09:27.693 --> 09:28.777
Oh, Peggy.

09:30.070 --> 09:34.074
I would like to see you outside
of work hours, in 21st century clothes.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.160
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, huh?

09:38.662 --> 09:42.708
I keep thinkin' about what you said,
that there's one great love left in you.

09:42.708 --> 09:46.295
Yep. I want what Isolde and Tristan had
or nothing less.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.922
Well, you know they died at the end.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.676
Just their flesh.
Trees sprang out of their graves.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.931
Look, we have chemistry, okay.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.016
Yeah.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.101
And I'm no prude.

10:01.101 --> 10:05.814
I've had more sex than Wilt Chamberlain,
so I know a thing or two about the flesh,

10:06.356 --> 10:11.653
but I need that thing
that I have always missed.

10:13.405 --> 10:17.784
And maybe that's you and me.
It takes time to figure it out.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.538
So, if that means that you
need to see other people,

10:21.538 --> 10:22.748
I can live with that.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.715
- What about Brenda from Accounting?
- Shit-bag.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.550
- With the owl pins?
- Well--

10:33.550 --> 10:35.302
- I can live with that.
- He dumped me.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.305
- He threw me out half-naked.
- I know.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.893
Look who decided
to come back to her job after a week.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.356
- Oh, my God.
- What?

10:48.023 --> 10:52.611
She's got big old jugs.
She didn't have big jugs before.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.322
Why doesn't he love me?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.742
- Okay.
- Do you want a hug? Oh, my God.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.202
He dumped her.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.540
Where did she get those? Jugs cost coin.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.126
I love watching your mind work.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.714
I can get you the money back,
plus interest,

11:12.714 --> 11:15.175
but I get
the Pioneertown security contract.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.261
No, not if you don't tell me who it was.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.887
Hey, I'm no rat.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.598
You should've seen
the look on my mother's face.

11:21.598 --> 11:26.562
I've seen it. She has one look.
You can interpret it lots of ways.

11:26.562 --> 11:31.108
She was very upset about this.
She was very upset at me.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.026
Yeah, well,
her birthday was used against her.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.237
That money was
for the President's Day show,

11:35.237 --> 11:38.031
which is make-it-or-break-it time for us.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.242
And I had to get this new safe.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.954
Have you heard about Slide City?

11:44.621 --> 11:47.541
They're expanding,
and it's not just water slides anymore.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.794
No, now they got surfing.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.089
Their billboards are insane.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.301
Well, we can expand too.
Bring in some Civil War shit.

11:57.885 --> 12:01.388
I'm sad that somebody out there,
one of them,

12:01.388 --> 12:03.849
- somebody that I treat like family...
- Do you?

12:03.849 --> 12:06.226
...walked in here and stole from me.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.355
Get the cops off our back,
I'll get you the money back.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.982
It'll clean you up with your mother.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.361
You have 24 hours.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.156
Yeah, I'd like 72 or four days.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.618
Forty-eight hours,
it's two days, but no more.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.203
I'm serious Peggy, no more.

12:24.203 --> 12:27.289
- Okay, fine, agreed. Sixty hours.
- No-- Peggy!

12:32.544 --> 12:33.754
Whiskey.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.425
I ain't seen you
around these parts before, stranger.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.138
There's been a crime
and your tits are the smoking gun, hon.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.598
You damn cheater!

12:50.729 --> 12:51.772
Here we go!

12:51.772 --> 12:53.524
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:53.524 --> 12:58.070
Two knockers and no boyfriend
equals a felony, and you know it.

12:58.779 --> 12:59.780
Uh-uh?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.663
They got prints off the safe.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.791
- I had to! I had to do it!
- Oh, Jesus.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.044
He was gonna pay for them
but then he broke up with me.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.046
I need the edge to get him back.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.632
He can have anybody he wants, Peggy.

13:22.553 --> 13:25.514
You can do better than that ass bag!

13:26.181 --> 13:27.391
Look out!

13:27.391 --> 13:29.476
He's a celebrity and a guru.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.855
He does this thing
where he puts his fingers all over my face

13:32.855 --> 13:35.399
and I can't tell you how powerful it is.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.734
Do you wanna go to jail
for this fucking guy?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.903
I'll scrape it together. I'll pay it back.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.113
Can you tell them?

13:43.740 --> 13:48.203
I'll scrape it together for you
if you'll swear off of this fucknut, okay?

13:48.829 --> 13:52.249
- Really?
- He is a fraud and a creep.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.252
Take a look at yourself.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.171
Come on, now.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.464
Okay, you do look good.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.467
Okay? Especially for three grand,
which is insane!

14:03.594 --> 14:06.805
Look, I'll take care of it, okay?

14:07.598 --> 14:09.391
What's this fucking swami's address?

14:26.283 --> 14:27.284
Okay.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.997
- Uh-uh, I'm just picking up some cash.
- May I have the keys?

14:31.997 --> 14:34.625
- Just 'cause I have to move it?
- I don't want it scratched.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.922
Thank you.

14:42.382 --> 14:47.971
As you exhale,
release the bondage of perception.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.142
Look again.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.229
Can you see what it is now?

14:55.229 --> 14:58.398
Can you see the masterpiece
that's in front of you?

15:00.442 --> 15:01.610
Yeah, I don't like it.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.695
- It's--
- Okay,

15:03.695 --> 15:05.155
- close your eyes again.
- No, nah.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.949
That was making me nauseous. None of that.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.701
Sotheby's just sold a Picasso
for 30 million.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.537
It was a lot bigger than this one,

15:11.537 --> 15:15.040
but this really is the most
important painting in all of cubism.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.000
The <i>Pigeon with peas</i> started a revolution.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.836
Where's the pigeon?
I don't even see the pigeon.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.004
- It's a-- The pigeon's in there.
- Can you point out, like,

15:21.004 --> 15:23.632
- a beak or anything?
- No, I can't point out a beak.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.678
What I can point out is that this painting
has not been on the market for decades

15:27.678 --> 15:31.265
and that window is rapidly closing,
so can you afford it?

15:31.265 --> 15:36.687
Or perhaps the question should really be,
"Can you afford not to afford it?"

15:36.687 --> 15:39.147
I can afford it,
I just don't like it. It's stupid.

15:39.147 --> 15:44.236
This is cubism. It is total nonsense, yes.
But it is high nonsense.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.320
No, it's not.

15:45.946 --> 15:50.158
He's fucking with perception, memory,
the whole time-space continuum.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.243
Yes.

15:51.743 --> 15:55.747
But, in a sense, he is using
an impressionistic expression--

15:55.747 --> 15:59.376
Does the bullshit ever stop with you?
It has nothing to do with impressionism.

15:59.376 --> 16:03.172
What you're looking at here is the past
and the future in the present.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.508
- His point is to blow your fucking mind.
- Exactly!

16:06.508 --> 16:09.887
Picasso's defiance is the point
of this piece.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.222
- It is literally surreal.
- It's not surreal.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.766
This whole fucking conversation
is surreal.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.101
Would you stop talking?

16:16.602 --> 16:17.853
Can I just--

16:17.853 --> 16:21.106
What was that? You just cost me a deal.
You may as well have robbed me.

16:21.106 --> 16:24.276
Uh-huh. How much do you want?
I know some people.

16:24.276 --> 16:25.611
What people? You don't know people.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.237
Y-- No pictures.
It's not the Grand Canyon.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.447
Who are you, lady?

16:28.447 --> 16:31.158
Look, I used to nude model in New York.
Long story.

16:31.158 --> 16:35.537
Anyway, I met this art guy through
Gagosian back in the day, a real shark.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.497
Let's just say he knows his way
around provenance.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.957
I picked up a thing or two.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.461
- And he sold paintings or...
- All of it.

16:42.461 --> 16:46.131
I mean, lithographs, paintings,
sculptures, a few weapons.

16:47.049 --> 16:50.344
Uh-huh. Well, what say we start over?

16:50.344 --> 16:51.970
I don't believe we've met.

16:52.596 --> 16:53.597
No.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.350
- So who did you come with?
- Nobody.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.810
So you're a guru, huh?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.812
- How does that work?
- Let me show you.

17:12.366 --> 17:16.494
No. That shit
doesn't work on me. I'm not Tammy.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.539
You see,
I knew you were working something.

17:18.539 --> 17:19.623
You owe her three grand.

17:19.623 --> 17:22.334
You ordered a pair of jugs
and you left her holding the bag

17:22.334 --> 17:25.753
- and I'm here to collect.
- Okay, how do you know Tammy?

17:26.630 --> 17:27.673
Colleagues.

17:27.673 --> 17:30.509
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

17:30.509 --> 17:31.760
I know real gurus.

17:31.760 --> 17:36.265
I know a guy who can sit cross-legged
in the air. Can you do that?

17:37.015 --> 17:39.142
- Can you go?
- I want Tammy's money.

17:39.142 --> 17:43.063
She took it for you
and now she's looking at jail time.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.314
Meditate on that.

17:44.314 --> 17:48.485
If you truly are a guru,
you'll see the barbarity here.

17:49.361 --> 17:51.947
- Hey, can you-- Can I--
- Everything's stupid.

17:51.947 --> 17:54.575
Hey, what are you-- Can you not?

17:54.575 --> 17:56.660
Here.
Call me when you have a change of heart.

17:57.619 --> 18:01.290
- Front door's right down the stairs.
- I gotta piss. I need privacy.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.125
- No.
- Violent stomach issues.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.626
- No.
- I'll be back.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.336
No, not that way. No.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.928
Can you unlock the door, please?

18:16.388 --> 18:17.556
Hello?

18:22.811 --> 18:24.021
That's my room.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.027
"Donatella"?

18:31.403 --> 18:33.655
I'll be right out, Maharishi.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.497
- <i>Hello? Open the door.</i>
- It hurts!

18:56.428 --> 18:57.930
I take a lot of Ibuprofen.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.348
It's a nightmare. Don't ask.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.891
Let me know if you need some.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.145
All right.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.065
- It's okay.
- Well, no. It's not okay.

19:08.065 --> 19:12.069
If the real one's in Boston,
why'd I pay three million for this?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.780
I swear, I didn't know.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.740
You're lying.

19:17.241 --> 19:18.575
This is my daughter, Heather.

19:18.575 --> 19:19.660
Hello.

19:19.660 --> 19:21.578
I need my money, Robert.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.539
I don't have it right now.

19:23.539 --> 19:26.041
I mean, I have it,
but it's not really liquid.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.168
Can I take it off?

19:28.168 --> 19:30.921
Hey, I can get it. I can get the money.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.840
When can you get it?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.800
Well, I mean, it's three million dollars.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.926
It's gonna take me a second.

19:35.926 --> 19:38.136
- Hey, just--
- Can I take it, Daddy?

19:38.136 --> 19:41.348
- Jesus Christ, lady!
- Give it a nick. Just a nick.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.600
No! Shit!

19:44.476 --> 19:46.645
Good. I wanted to meet the caterer.

19:46.645 --> 19:49.815
Who thought of putting together
watermelon and feta?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.151
Unbelievable!

20:06.832 --> 20:08.959
<i>Bruce Harvey Investigations.</i>

20:08.959 --> 20:10.961
<i>Leave a message. I'll get back to you.</i>

20:10.961 --> 20:14.006
Big headline.
I found the guy with the painting.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.634
You remember that
"Everything's stupid" guy?

20:18.343 --> 20:22.014
The anchorman who went nuts
and started calling himself "guru."

20:22.598 --> 20:23.599
That's him.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.810
Weird shit is going down there.

20:27.769 --> 20:32.774
Crazy house, possible stolen paintings,
people with knives.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.694
Plus his nipple's bleeding.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.404
Call me.

20:41.909 --> 20:44.745
I've got it! I've got bingo. Bingo!

21:02.804 --> 21:05.432
I saw a prescription bottle at the guru's.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.476
I just happened to see it.

21:08.352 --> 21:12.147
- It was for a Donatella Scarborough.
- Donatella Scarborough.

21:12.147 --> 21:14.233
I'm gonna Internet stalk that shit.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.287
Where are you right now?

21:28.872 --> 21:30.874
I'm at the Grand Oasis.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.920
I just wanna play bingo
and I don't even have money for dabbers.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.755
<i>Listen. Listen to me.</i>

21:36.755 --> 21:41.844
I want you to say something out loud.

21:42.511 --> 21:47.140
"Money comes easily."

21:47.850 --> 21:48.851
That's right.

21:49.643 --> 21:52.020
"Money comes easily."

21:55.232 --> 21:56.859
"Money comes easily."

22:08.412 --> 22:10.747
Hey, you wanna smoke a joint?

22:12.374 --> 22:14.626
Yeah, it's just what I need right now.

22:14.626 --> 22:15.919
I can do better than that.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.004
Yeah?

22:20.757 --> 22:21.758
How much?

22:23.093 --> 22:25.137
They're usually 50 each.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.930
I could do 30.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.058
Four for a hundred.

22:30.976 --> 22:31.977
You're on.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.313
<i>All right, you sinners.</i>

22:36.106 --> 22:38.233
Gangbang 49.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.568
Bingo!

22:41.528 --> 22:45.574
Honey, you don't have bingo.
You have a big fucking mouth though.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.996
Someone didn't bring his hearing aids.

22:51.997 --> 22:54.124
Bestiality bingo 14.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.043
I didn't sign up for this.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.420
You have it.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.632
Look!

23:12.518 --> 23:15.687
And a blow job for one!

23:29.660 --> 23:32.329
Just a little humble boink 14.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.164
Nasty, evil 32!

23:34.164 --> 23:35.791
Bingo!

23:36.792 --> 23:37.835
Bingo!

23:51.306 --> 23:53.559
- You got Tammy's money or not?
- <i>No!</i>

23:54.768 --> 23:57.688
No?
That's what you're calling to say to me?

23:57.688 --> 23:58.772
<i>No!</i>

23:58.772 --> 24:01.066
- No!
- <i>Hey!</i>

24:01.066 --> 24:02.943
- No!
- <i>I can say no, too!</i>

24:03.527 --> 24:05.863
No calling without Tammy's money!

24:06.530 --> 24:07.823
<i>No money, no calling.</i>

24:07.823 --> 24:09.533
- Hey, no.
- Who's that?

24:09.533 --> 24:10.951
Help me! Help!

24:11.743 --> 24:13.912
- Oh, God!
- What else are you hiding?

24:16.498 --> 24:20.043
No fucking wasting my time,
you quack-chiseling shyster.

24:20.544 --> 24:21.712
Oh, fuck.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.513
Oh, shit.
