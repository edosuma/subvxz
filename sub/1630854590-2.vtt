01:40.100 --> 01:41.362

02:16.440 --> 02:18.660
Just breathe, breathe with me.
Come on.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.401
Come on, breathe.

02:30.933 --> 02:31.847
- I'll send for a doctor.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.421
- No need.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.379
[music]

[panting]

03:03.835 --> 03:04.836
[sniffs]

03:09.101 --> 03:10.146
- Anyone got a cigarette?

03:15.238 --> 03:16.239
I'm gonna need a light.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.297
Any of you a doctor?

03:31.298 --> 03:32.255
- I am.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.387
- Get your bag.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.480
- You need to clean
those wounds.

03:39.523 --> 03:40.263
- One step ahead of you.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.485
Tell these people to go back
to their tents.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.704
- Return to your quarters,
please.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.490
All is safe.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.278
- It was a leopardess.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.062
I've never seen a
female hunt a man.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.673
- How's the husband holding up?

03:58.716 --> 03:59.935
- How do you think?

04:02.503 --> 04:05.027
- I can't say I'm familiar with
treating a leopard attack.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.769
- They got a bunch of
shit in their claws.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.685
If we don't clean it good, I'll
have gangrene within a week.

04:10.728 --> 04:13.340
- I have iodine and bromine.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.471
That should kill
just about anything.

04:16.603 --> 04:18.867
I'll need to get it
deep into the wound.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.436
[winces]

04:24.525 --> 04:26.657
You should go to the hospital
in Nairobi.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.442
They will need to clean
and dress these wounds again.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.273
[speaking foreign language]

04:34.970 --> 04:37.015
- Linda needs
to take Kagiso home.

04:37.058 --> 04:39.104
- I'll get them on the train.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.541
- Much appreciated.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.372
[speaking foreign language]

04:56.644 --> 04:58.123
- Any wounds on your back?

04:58.167 --> 04:59.429
- No, I took him head on.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.344
- Wish I had something
for the pain.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.171
- That's what the whiskey's for.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.390
- Fair enough.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.444
- My God, man...

05:14.488 --> 05:16.577
The closest I've been
to a leopard is twenty feet.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.535
And I couldn't sleep
for a week after.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.669
What was it like?

05:21.712 --> 05:23.148
Fighting the thing with your
bare hands, what was that like?

05:23.192 --> 05:25.586
- You didn't say you were sorry.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.848
- Sorry?

05:26.891 --> 05:28.284
- About my friend.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.331
- Which friend?

05:31.374 --> 05:32.810
- The one who died for you.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.423
- I'm sending him on the train.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.076
- But you didn't
say that you were sorry.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.907
They were a breeding
pair, Holland.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.518
Breeding pairs hunt together,

05:44.561 --> 05:45.909
but you only showed us
one set of tracks.

05:47.085 --> 05:51.960
[music]

05:52.003 --> 05:53.135
You knew.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.137
- I didn't know.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.314
- You knew.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.533
If I'd known I would
have never split us up.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.882
I would have kept us together.

06:00.925 --> 06:06.191
[music]

06:06.235 --> 06:07.628
Now say you're sorry.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.328
- I'm sorry for your loss.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.851
- I didn't lose anything.

06:13.895 --> 06:16.898
- I'm sorry for his loss.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.856
[cocks gun]

06:18.900 --> 06:20.902
- I'm sorry for his family's
loss, I'm sorry for his wife.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.338
- For his children.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.557
- Yes, his children.
I'm sorry for his children.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.906
[gunshot]

06:24.949 --> 06:28.518
[gasping]

06:28.562 --> 06:29.737
I'm sorry.

06:29.780 --> 06:30.999
- Say it again.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.393
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:38.572 --> 06:39.573
- I'm sorry too.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.971
[music]

06:50.627 --> 06:52.368
The only reason
I'm not killing you right now

06:52.412 --> 06:54.022
is because I need a ride
to Nairobi in the morning.

06:56.284 --> 06:58.026
[music]

07:09.298 --> 07:11.126
[cowboys whooping]

07:14.608 --> 07:15.870
- Jake.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.524
Something's up there

07:17.567 --> 07:19.395
and these cattle don't wanna go
anywhere near it.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.615
- Quiet. Listen. Listen.
- [gunshots]

07:21.658 --> 07:23.617
- [gunshot]
- That's a gunshot.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.096
- Goddammit.
- That's a gunshot.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.316
- Ya!

07:27.359 --> 07:29.623
Hey, hey cow.
Hey cow.

07:29.666 --> 07:34.323
- Zane! Forget the herd,
get on top! On top!

07:38.588 --> 07:39.589
[grunting]

07:48.424 --> 07:49.643
- Hey, I'm unarmed.
I'm unarmed.

07:52.123 --> 07:55.562
[gunfire]

08:08.096 --> 08:09.140
- Zane!

08:11.534 --> 08:12.579
- Whoa, whoa!

08:15.930 --> 08:17.018
- You son of a bitch.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.367
[grunts]

08:18.410 --> 08:19.629
[hits ground]

08:24.155 --> 08:28.420
You come on my land
with your prairie maggots!

08:28.464 --> 08:30.118
Shoot at my kin!

08:30.161 --> 08:32.554
- God!

08:32.599 --> 08:34.251
I shot at no one.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.472
I don't know who shot.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.605
I thought the boy shot at us!

08:38.648 --> 08:40.520
- Zane!
- Which one shot at you?

08:40.563 --> 08:42.390
- They was all shooting at me!

08:42.433 --> 08:45.525
- I'll hunt us up some trees.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.919
- You're gonna hang us? Ey?

08:48.963 --> 08:51.269
Hang me?

08:51.313 --> 08:54.055
It's the fucking
20th century,

08:54.098 --> 08:55.404
and you're gonna hang us?

08:56.665 --> 08:59.582
For keeping my sheep
from starving.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.237
Cattle don't graze up here.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.369
Nothing grazes up here!

09:05.849 --> 09:09.200
Go ahead, hang us.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.420
Fucking hang us.

09:11.463 --> 09:15.119
And see how long it takes
the state of Montana

09:15.163 --> 09:16.817
to fucking hang you!

09:16.860 --> 09:19.297
- What did I tell you I'd do

09:19.341 --> 09:24.389
if I found your sheep
grazing another man's land?

09:24.433 --> 09:26.000
Zane!

09:26.043 --> 09:28.437
Take eight cowboys
and round up these sheep.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.352
Start pushing them
towards the Rez.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.180
- Yes, sir.
Let's do it, boys.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.139
- They're starving on
the rez.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.488
Starving...

09:36.532 --> 09:37.707
We'll fix that.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.363
You owe my nephew a horse.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.587
[music]

09:51.547 --> 09:54.637
- We taking these boys to town?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.770
- I've got something
else in mind.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.866
Sister Mary: American women
must maintain the house.

10:05.909 --> 10:08.956
A slovenly-kept home breeds
apathy in children

10:08.999 --> 10:10.479
as well as disease,

10:10.522 --> 10:15.049
not to mention the wrath of
the husband who built the home.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.746
He made it, you clean it.

10:16.790 --> 10:21.708
Line yourselves against
the wall facing me.

10:21.751 --> 10:25.886
When I say, you will sweep
to the edge in my direction.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.802
Now sweep.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.384
Did I say sweep
it off the edge?

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
Now you have
a mess on the steps.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.442
[grip tightens]

11:01.530 --> 11:06.491
[music]

11:06.535 --> 11:09.756
Sweep it to the edge
then grab a dust pan

11:09.799 --> 11:12.236
and sweep it off
the edge into the pan.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.847
Then take it to
the field and dump it.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.516
Again.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.823
Place your wet linen on
the board and stretch it out.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.481
Grab the bar of soap and run
the bar of soap

11:39.524 --> 11:42.136
over the linen until it suds.

11:42.179 --> 11:45.487
And now run the linen over
the board

11:45.530 --> 11:49.839
and one-two-three-four,

11:49.883 --> 11:52.842
dunk in the water, turn it over,

11:52.886 --> 11:55.889
stretch it out.

11:55.932 --> 11:59.153
Grab the bar of soap
and run it over the linen

11:59.196 --> 12:01.851
one, two, three, four.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.377
[music]

12:29.661 --> 12:31.489
Sister Mary: Lord Jesus,
be our guest.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.840
All: Lord Jesus, be our guest.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.799
- We ask you to
bless this food.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.496
All: We ask you to bless
this food.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.151
Sister Mary: That it may nourish
us and sustain us.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.196
All: That it may nourish us
and sustain us.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.372
[speaking Native language]

12:57.515 --> 12:59.343
[shrieking, shouting]

13:17.144 --> 13:18.145
[gulps]

13:20.408 --> 13:21.365
- I warned you, Banner.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.847
Now you attack my family.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.634
It's gonna be the last thing
you ever do.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.816
Jake: Ya!
- Ya!

13:37.251 --> 13:38.382
[gagging]

13:38.426 --> 13:40.384
- Whoa. Whoa.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.038
- What do we do?

13:42.082 --> 13:43.735
- You stay real fucking still.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.086
Try to work your hands free.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.436
[straining]

13:50.351 --> 13:51.656
[grunts]

13:53.789 --> 13:56.705
[music]

14:05.932 --> 14:08.021
- Perhaps the hot box
will teach you

14:08.064 --> 14:10.023
the piety Sister Mary
failed to impart upon you.

14:12.634 --> 14:16.377
If you speak that
filth in my school again...

14:18.727 --> 14:20.990
I will bury you alive.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.123
And the world will be
done with you.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.082
[speaks French]

14:29.825 --> 14:33.481
[music]

14:51.325 --> 14:57.113
Man signing: â™ª At night as I lay
on the prairie â™ª

14:57.157 --> 15:01.161
â™ª And gaze at the stars
in the sky â™ª

15:04.338 --> 15:05.992
- With everything grazed
off here

15:06.035 --> 15:08.429
we're going to have
to keep heading south.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.605
- We're gonna be on top of
the park before you know it.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.302
And every time a cow balks
that's gonna be a dinner bell

15:12.346 --> 15:14.000
for the wolves and bears.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.133
- We're gonna have to prowl
through 'em all summer.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.483
- We ain't getting
that a wagon up any higher.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.007
How we gonna keep
these boys fed?

15:21.050 --> 15:24.662
- We'll pack a camp up
on mules.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.795
Tough it out on elk meat.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.579
- It's gonna be real hard
on these boys.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.538
- Hell, that's how
we used to do it.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.757
We never left the herd.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.064
Weren't no bunkhouse.

15:35.108 --> 15:39.199
It took me ten years
to sleep six months indoors.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.723
"Easy" wasn't in
the job description.

15:48.295 --> 15:51.167
[groans]

15:51.211 --> 15:53.343
- You think any of 'em made it?

15:53.387 --> 15:55.084
- Depends on the
loyalty of their horse.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.218
You give a man enough time,

15:58.261 --> 16:00.829
he'll figure his
way out of anything.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.094
I figure a few'll make it.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.271
I hope a few do.

16:08.315 --> 16:10.317
- Why?

16:10.360 --> 16:13.015
Someday, you're gonna
run this place,

16:13.059 --> 16:16.976
and for your son
to someday run it too,

16:17.019 --> 16:21.458
you got to understand what this
ranch's greatest enemy is.

16:21.502 --> 16:26.811
It's not wolves, or drought
or blizzards or Texas Fever.

16:26.855 --> 16:30.119
It's other men.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.861
Man will choose
to take what you've built

16:32.904 --> 16:34.819
rather than try
and build it for himself.

16:36.125 --> 16:41.783
Every civilization
in this world

16:41.826 --> 16:44.133
is built on top
of the one they conquered.

16:44.177 --> 16:49.312
You go to Rome or Jerusalem
or Paris, France

16:49.356 --> 16:51.967
and it's cities stacked
on top of towns

16:52.011 --> 16:54.622
stacked on top of villages

16:54.665 --> 16:58.104
on top of one man's house

16:58.147 --> 17:01.977
built on top
of one man's cave.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.415
Wish it wasn't so, but it is.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.462
Your enemies have
got to be so terrified

17:08.505 --> 17:14.207
that their fear is
greater than their greed.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.339
I gave those men a chance

17:17.384 --> 17:20.647
'cause I wanted them to
tell the world what happened

17:20.691 --> 17:22.214
when they crossed me.

17:28.308 --> 17:31.572
Let's get some sleep, boys.

17:31.615 --> 17:35.141
There ain't no telling what
tomorrow's gonna throw at us.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.318
[music]

17:42.452 --> 17:45.020
-[Elsa] "Man will always seek
to take from others

17:45.064 --> 17:48.110
that which he could
make for himself."

17:48.154 --> 17:51.809
Those are the words that
have governed this family.

17:51.853 --> 17:56.118
Or perhaps, it is our refusal
to surrender that governs us.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.078
- What is it?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.775
- Dogs were barking
at something.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.129
Is Elizabeth asleep?

18:07.173 --> 18:10.437
- She's upstairs singing
"All the Ways He Loves Me".

18:13.396 --> 18:15.659
You can hear her feet
waltzing across the floor,

18:15.703 --> 18:17.226
practicing for her reception.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.142
- [chuckles]
Oh, to be nineteen again.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.187
- You'd think growing up on
a ranch

18:21.230 --> 18:22.710
would've leathered
that one a bit.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.452
- She grew up in Boston,
summered out here like

18:25.495 --> 18:27.628
it was a lodge
in the park.

18:27.671 --> 18:31.849
Splashing in the rivers,
racing her horse across fields.

18:31.893 --> 18:35.375
The only thing her hands have
touched with purpose is a piano.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.290
[laughs]

18:37.333 --> 18:39.944
- I'm sure my son will remedy
that, if he hasn't already.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.555
- Emma.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.513
- I'm sorry.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.036
- I know you see it.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.256
- I see it.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.563
I just wasn't going
to mention it.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.218
I don't know where the
recklessness in him comes from.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.136
Not from me.

18:57.179 --> 19:00.922
And John is the most
deliberate man I've ever met.

19:00.965 --> 19:04.143
I was hoping his wife
would take some of

19:04.186 --> 19:05.535
the fire out of
the next generation.

19:07.015 --> 19:07.929
[Elizabeth humming]

19:15.458 --> 19:18.200
- It seems your son is marrying
gasoline, my dear.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.030
And the fire will
only get bigger.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.643
- My luck.

19:28.471 --> 19:29.951
- I wish we had two houses.

19:29.994 --> 19:30.995
- Two?

19:33.694 --> 19:35.261
- A smaller one
for when they're gone.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.266
This one feels empty.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.835
- That's why
I'm sitting out here.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.363
[rope creaking]

19:54.454 --> 19:55.672
[horse snorts]

20:00.242 --> 20:02.157
Oh...

20:02.201 --> 20:03.289
Come here.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.856
Whoa, boy.
Come here.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.861
Attaboy.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.648
[grunts]

20:14.691 --> 20:16.737
Come on.
Attaboy.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.002
[grunts]

20:21.045 --> 20:23.526
Ah...

20:23.570 --> 20:24.701
[grunts]

20:27.530 --> 20:28.531
[panting]

20:35.321 --> 20:37.932
Whoa, whoa, boy.
Whoa, boy.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.325
Whoa. Whoa, boy.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.024
[grunts]

20:47.028 --> 20:49.335
[panting, grunting]

20:54.775 --> 20:56.298
Agh!

20:57.560 --> 21:01.085
[groaning, coughing]

21:09.790 --> 21:11.531
[grunts]

21:17.841 --> 21:19.103
[laughs]

21:20.191 --> 21:21.889
[music]

21:46.217 --> 21:47.349
[typing]

22:05.062 --> 22:07.326
- I'm here to see
the super-tendent.

22:15.725 --> 22:16.770
- Do you have an appointment?

22:23.733 --> 22:24.865
Have a seat.

22:42.752 --> 22:43.840
[speaking Native language]

23:12.826 --> 23:13.653
- That's right, bring them up.

23:17.221 --> 23:19.049
[sheep bleating]

23:22.139 --> 23:23.010
[cowboys yipping]

23:42.333 --> 23:43.596
- We don't want your sheep here.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.424
- Ain't my sheep.
They're your sheep.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.165
- Our sheep?

23:48.209 --> 23:49.993
- They're your sheep now.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.908
- We don't want sheep.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.475
With the sheep
the grass goes away

23:53.519 --> 23:55.129
and the wolves come.

23:55.172 --> 23:58.262
- I'm no fan of 'em either,
but they cook pretty good.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.612
I'm with The Yellowstone.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.135
- Mm.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.789
You are the Dutton.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.530
- Work for him.

24:04.573 --> 24:05.879
Found these sheep
in the mountains.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.142
Mr. Dutton said
to bring 'em to you.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.578
- To do what?

24:09.622 --> 24:11.188
- Whatever you want.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.103
Keep 'em. Sell 'em.
Eat 'em.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.018
You can make clothes
from the wool.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.890
They're a gift.

24:16.933 --> 24:20.328
Ground seems as bare here
as it is on our place.

24:20.371 --> 24:21.503
Figured you could use 'em.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.552
- We can use them.

24:26.595 --> 24:27.596
- Got some pens
to hold 'em up?

24:29.032 --> 24:31.557
- We have pens.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.168
- Need help getting them there?

24:34.211 --> 24:35.865
- No. We don't need help.

24:38.433 --> 24:39.478
Hey.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.218
You tell Dutton...

24:45.962 --> 24:46.659
"Thank you."

24:49.052 --> 24:49.836
- I'll tell him.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.796
[music]

24:53.840 --> 24:56.016
[speaking Native language]

24:57.887 --> 24:58.584
- Come on, boys.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.543
[music]

25:32.487 --> 25:34.141
[cowboy shouting]

25:37.057 --> 25:39.407
[cattle lowing]

25:46.414 --> 25:47.589
[shouting]

25:53.029 --> 25:56.250
- There's a spring feeding
into a lake over this rise.

25:56.293 --> 25:59.079
Might be a good
place to hold them.

25:59.122 --> 26:02.125
- Hold 'em up
and let 'em spread out.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.345
Pick three to stay
with the herd.

26:04.388 --> 26:07.740
- Hold them here.
Hold 'em up. Ya!

26:10.133 --> 26:11.787
[shouting]

26:13.615 --> 26:15.182
- Get the hell
out of here, boys!

26:15.225 --> 26:16.226
- We're goin' home now!

26:17.053 --> 26:21.536
[whooping]

26:21.580 --> 26:22.624
[shouting]

26:29.196 --> 26:31.894
- This is not the place to nap.
Mr. Worth will see you now.

26:34.897 --> 26:35.898
[clears throat]

26:35.942 --> 26:37.204
[knocks]

26:37.247 --> 26:38.422
- Come in.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.780
Have a seat.

26:54.308 --> 26:57.267
[fly buzzing]

26:57.311 --> 26:58.834
What can I do for you?

27:01.097 --> 27:05.580
- My granddaughter is in
a government boarding school

27:05.624 --> 27:07.060
in the Dakota.

27:07.103 --> 27:09.715
- It's North Dakota.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.718
No such thing
as "The Dakota."

27:12.761 --> 27:17.026
- The Baptists have day
schools on the reservation.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.855
One is only a quarter mile
from my house.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.683
- This is your granddaughter,
you say?

27:21.727 --> 27:23.598
- My granddaughter.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.382
- For an Indian child
to attend a day school,

27:25.426 --> 27:26.906
the school must be
within two miles

27:26.949 --> 27:28.864
of the child's
primary residence.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.823
- That is with me.

27:30.866 --> 27:34.000
She lived with me
before they took her.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.307
- Where are her parents?

27:37.351 --> 27:40.136
- Her mother is no more.

27:40.180 --> 27:43.836
Her father works
the reservation herd.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.533
- Mother's dead
and father abandoned her?

27:47.187 --> 27:49.711
- Not abandoned.
Working.

27:49.755 --> 27:53.323
- But not at her home.
That's abandoned.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.456
The law states for
an Indian child to attend

27:55.499 --> 27:58.067
a day school they must
live with their immediate family

27:58.111 --> 28:00.243
in their primary residence.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.593
- I am her family.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.815
[fly buzzing]

28:06.859 --> 28:08.774
- [sighs]

28:08.817 --> 28:10.689
Do you have a death certificate
on the mother?

28:18.348 --> 28:20.611
Hm. The flu.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.091
- The Spanish one.

28:22.135 --> 28:22.831
- Is there any other?

28:24.528 --> 28:26.792
This does not change the law.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.707
Just because her mother
is deceased,

28:28.750 --> 28:30.578
does not mean
you take her place.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.101
That's not how law works.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.713
If you wish to be her
immediate family,

28:34.756 --> 28:37.193
you must legally adopt her.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.065
- How do I do that?

28:39.108 --> 28:40.893
- You must go before
a judge, and request it.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.025
But...

28:43.069 --> 28:44.940
There is no judge.

28:44.984 --> 28:47.073
You are the judge.

28:47.116 --> 28:50.380
- There is a Magistrate
in Crow Agency. Go there.

28:53.862 --> 28:57.910
[fly buzzing]

28:57.953 --> 29:00.956
[music]

29:18.408 --> 29:19.932
[wheezing]

29:41.388 --> 29:43.607
- Come now child.

29:43.651 --> 29:44.391
Work the soap
through your hair.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.263
Come, come.

29:50.614 --> 29:53.182
[sighs]

29:53.226 --> 29:55.228
Don't worry, child.
I'll wash you.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.295
[panting]

30:29.262 --> 30:30.567
- [cries]

30:32.047 --> 30:33.832
- [exhales]

30:33.875 --> 30:36.008
- I'd say she's
clean enough, Sister.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.099
- I'll fetch her towel.

30:40.142 --> 30:41.709
- I'llfetch her towel.
Thank you, sister.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.058
That will be all.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.068
Can you speak?

30:56.550 --> 30:58.987
- I can speak.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.336
- Can you raise your arm?

31:06.952 --> 31:10.216
- You batter my face
with no provocation,

31:10.259 --> 31:11.957
but sit idly by as Sister Alice

31:12.000 --> 31:13.654
runs her filthy
hands across you.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.962
Perhaps I shouldn't
have interrupted.

31:22.358 --> 31:25.057
[music]

31:27.320 --> 31:29.888
Your fever will empty
the ice house all by itself.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.247
[exhales]

31:41.290 --> 31:44.598
You think I am your
adversary, but I am not.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.517
I am your salvation, Teonna.

31:50.560 --> 31:55.087
I am the bridge from the extinct
civilization of your people

31:55.130 --> 32:00.570
to the thriving society tasked
with taming this godless place.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.532
I offer all the skills required
for a young woman

32:05.575 --> 32:07.403
to thrive as mother and wife.

32:07.447 --> 32:10.189
How to farm, how to cook,

32:10.232 --> 32:13.105
how to clean, how to read,

32:13.148 --> 32:17.196
arithmetics, science, and most
important of all, scripture.

32:17.239 --> 32:21.069
I offer all the skills you need
to live a bountiful life.

32:22.549 --> 32:25.552
And you refuse them,
attack me for teaching them.

32:31.036 --> 32:31.993
Look at me, girl.

32:38.260 --> 32:42.177
I have sworn to kill the Indian
in you, and will keep my word.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.584
[coughing]

32:57.627 --> 32:58.672
If you ever lay
a hand on me again,

32:58.715 --> 32:59.629
I'll kill the rest of you.

33:04.547 --> 33:07.550
[gasping]

33:17.256 --> 33:19.649
[music]

33:36.449 --> 33:38.277
[chattering, music plays]

33:39.713 --> 33:41.193
[indistinct chatter]

33:46.502 --> 33:47.242
- Hey, let's go.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.428
- My friends are too intimidated
to ask, so they sent me.

33:59.472 --> 34:00.690
- Ask what?

34:00.734 --> 34:03.084
[giggles]

34:03.128 --> 34:04.868
- American.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.957
- I'll never understand why
you British are always

34:07.001 --> 34:10.570
so shocked to find an American
anywhere but America.

34:10.612 --> 34:12.398
- Because it's so far.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.530
Look how far you've traveled.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.315
- Look how far you've traveled.
I'm not shocked to meet you.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.449
- You're rude.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.581
- Us Americans are renowned
for our lack of manners.

34:22.625 --> 34:23.409
- Hm. True.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.629
Do you drink Champagne?

34:26.672 --> 34:28.630
- When I'm celebrating.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.155
- And whiskey when you're down.

34:33.331 --> 34:34.463
- Whiskey when I'm down.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.686
- Here's to something
worth celebrating.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.079
May it find you soon, sir.

34:42.688 --> 34:43.646
[clink]

34:43.690 --> 34:45.213
Huzzah.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.871
I like your style, sir.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.483
- What is this question
you've been sent to ask me?

34:54.527 --> 34:57.921
- I don't have to ask it, now.
I know the answer.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.314
You're a hunter.

35:02.883 --> 35:06.278
Which reserve?

35:06.321 --> 35:09.585
- I don't guide hunters,
I work for the Protectorate.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.152
[laughs]

35:12.806 --> 35:14.024
[girls chattering]

35:17.593 --> 35:19.334
- I can't understand
anything you're saying.

35:19.378 --> 35:20.944
- You're Spencer Dutton,
the American war hero

35:20.988 --> 35:22.816
who hunts the man-eaters.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.644
You killed the-man eater
of the Kalahari,

35:24.687 --> 35:27.125
the man-eater of Sabi
and the man-eaters of Tsavo.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.909
- I was five when they killed
the man-eater of Tsavo.

35:28.952 --> 35:30.389
- You'll never convince
her that.

35:30.432 --> 35:31.738
- And you just killed
the man-eating leopards

35:31.781 --> 35:33.000
of Mount Suswa.

35:33.043 --> 35:35.959
- You're famous,
in case you were unaware.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.483
- I was unaware.

35:37.526 --> 35:38.832
- Well, you are...

35:38.875 --> 35:41.400
It's said you killed one
with your bare hands.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.403
- You believe everything
you hear?

35:44.446 --> 35:46.448
- Only when
I want it to be true.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.623
- Why would you want
that to be true?

35:47.667 --> 35:50.104
- For the romance of it.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.280
- There's no romance in it.

35:56.458 --> 35:57.677
- Then why do you do it?

36:04.901 --> 36:07.556
- Because dying is the most
alive you'll ever feel.

36:13.562 --> 36:14.911
- [whispers]
You don't see
the romance in that?

36:16.652 --> 36:19.046
[music]

36:20.656 --> 36:22.702
- And that's quite enough.

36:22.745 --> 36:25.444
She's engaged, sir.

36:25.487 --> 36:26.227
Good day to you.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.056
Come along, now.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.899
[chatter]

37:01.219 --> 37:02.829
Man: Terrible about Kagiso.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.574
He was our best guide.

37:10.750 --> 37:12.491
- Yes, he was.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.191
- How long for
those wounds to heal?

37:17.235 --> 37:20.238
- Doctor says a couple weeks.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.717
- I need you in Tanganyika.

37:21.761 --> 37:23.545
- I don't have any guides.

37:23.589 --> 37:26.113
- There's guides in Tanganyika.

37:26.156 --> 37:28.811
- Leopard or lion?
- Hyena.

37:28.855 --> 37:31.379
- Spotted?
- Mm.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.251
You don't have anyone at
the camp who can handle it?

37:33.294 --> 37:35.122
- Oh, it's not near a camp.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.255
It's hitting the engineers
on the railroad.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.693
I'd rather not wait two weeks
for you to get there.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.043
Can you hold a rifle
to that shoulder?

37:43.086 --> 37:45.175
- Yeah, I can hold a rifle.

37:45.219 --> 37:47.221
How is the road to Tanganyika?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.005
- You'll not confuse it
for a street in London.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.964
[laughs]

37:51.007 --> 37:52.574
I've settled your tab
at the bar.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.228
- I'm not done yet.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.187
- Oh, I have factored
in the future.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.233
There will be a car ready
for you in the morning.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.411
[music]

38:20.733 --> 38:22.691
[chattering]

38:30.743 --> 38:32.266
[taps glass]

38:35.748 --> 38:39.578
- Allow me to raise a glass to
this most unique of locations

38:39.621 --> 38:42.972
for the presentation
of an engagement,

38:43.016 --> 38:45.714
but when you consider the bride,

38:45.758 --> 38:48.848
perhaps the company
of lions makes perfect sense.

38:48.891 --> 38:54.767
After all, she has their spirit,
and their mane.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.159
[laughing]

38:56.203 --> 38:58.379
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

39:02.383 --> 39:03.428
- Oh, dear.

39:15.614 --> 39:16.745
- If you'd excuse me.

39:18.617 --> 39:19.748
- Of course.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.010
- Thank you.

39:26.712 --> 39:27.408
Arthur: Feeding time.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.415
[music]

39:40.900 --> 39:42.728
[panting]

39:51.563 --> 39:53.260
[exhales]

39:55.393 --> 39:56.524
Jennifer: Alexandra.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.227
- I have been placed
on a train with a destination

40:04.271 --> 40:10.059
not of my choosing and I have
no means of stopping it.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.714
- He's kind, Alex.

40:12.758 --> 40:15.674
That's more than
I can say for most.

40:15.717 --> 40:18.067
- [whispers]
Who did kindness sweep
from their feet?

40:23.159 --> 40:26.989
I'm a real estate
transaction, Jennifer.

40:27.033 --> 40:29.601
That's all this is.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.646
- Oh, Alex.

40:33.474 --> 40:36.303
All men are the same
after thirty:

40:36.346 --> 40:39.959
their hair line retreats and
their bellies march forward.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.222
- [laughs]

40:42.265 --> 40:45.181
- The time will come when
kindness is the only
thing that matters.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.755
- Then I pray
a kind one finds you.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.499
Or have mine.
[laughs]

40:58.543 --> 41:01.284
- What terrible children
you'll raise.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.156
Let's go back.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.767
- You go.

41:05.811 --> 41:06.812
I'll be along.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.475
[music]

41:47.548 --> 41:48.854
- You're just like
the wildlife here.

41:51.117 --> 41:53.467
Migrating from watering hole
to watering hole.

42:03.608 --> 42:05.087
- I'd be easy to ambush.
- [laughs]

42:06.436 --> 42:07.437
- I suppose I'll see you
at the bar

42:07.481 --> 42:08.961
in the breakfast hall
in the morning.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.049
- I'll be gone in the morning.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.012
- Where does the next
adventure take you?

42:17.056 --> 42:18.057
- East.

42:23.279 --> 42:24.150
Where's it take you?

42:26.718 --> 42:28.937
- I'm afraid all
my adventures are over.

42:30.330 --> 42:31.461
- That's a shame.

42:33.899 --> 42:34.639
- I agree.

42:36.989 --> 42:38.860
Perhaps you'd whisk
me away on yours.

42:43.038 --> 42:44.039
- You wouldn't like mine.

42:49.218 --> 42:50.568
- Don't bet on it.

42:51.873 --> 42:53.571
[music]

42:56.182 --> 42:59.968
Fiance: Alexandra.

43:00.012 --> 43:00.795
- [exhales]

43:04.320 --> 43:05.757
- I see what you mean.

43:06.932 --> 43:08.629
[music]

43:37.092 --> 43:38.833
[chattering]

43:39.747 --> 43:40.835
- Good morning.

43:40.879 --> 43:42.881
- Little early to call it good.
- [laughs]

43:55.328 --> 43:58.766
[music]

44:13.128 --> 44:14.652
- She's going to run
that skinny boy ragged.

44:19.482 --> 44:21.223
- I hear the road
to Serengeti is bad.

44:21.267 --> 44:22.572
- Definitely.

44:22.616 --> 44:23.791
You will find it
most unpleasant.

44:27.316 --> 44:29.057
[music]

44:41.287 --> 44:43.898
[laughing]

45:21.719 --> 45:23.982
- Alexandra?

45:38.648 --> 45:39.649
- Stop the car.

45:47.048 --> 45:48.441
- Got room for another?

45:48.484 --> 45:50.312
- No, not really.

45:50.356 --> 45:51.879
- My knight in shining armor.

45:57.493 --> 45:58.451
- Alexandra?

45:58.494 --> 45:59.844
- Please drive.

46:04.544 --> 46:06.764
Look at me.

46:06.807 --> 46:09.636
If you don't want me
to come, I'll get out.

46:09.679 --> 46:11.986
- Where I'm going is dangerous.

46:12.030 --> 46:13.988
- Let's look death in
the eye then, shall we?

46:25.043 --> 46:26.348
Find someone who loves you.

46:31.353 --> 46:32.920
[music]

47:00.992 --> 47:02.994
[music]
