WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:01.635 --> 00:02.536
- I don't know what
your relationship status is,

00:03.604 --> 00:05.473
and I don't care,
but I need to know

00:05.473 --> 00:07.508
someone's got Lindsay's back
24 hours a day.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.743
- Always.
- Hey, Olinsky?

00:09.743 --> 00:12.480
Michelle Sovana
keeps calling for you.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.614
- You know,
now would be a great time

00:13.614 --> 00:14.915
for you to try to be my dad.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.385
- I'm trying here.
Trust me.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.720
- Look, Mom,
it's not that you're bad for me.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.589
It's that we're bad
for each other.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.656
We need time apart.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.991
- This is Hank Voight.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.659
He put you up to this.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.796
I'd like to report a crime
by a Sergeant Hank Voight.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.564
I want him put in jail.

00:34.068 --> 00:37.071
[soft music]

00:37.071 --> 00:38.206
*

00:38.206 --> 00:41.242
- So when does the new wing
at Chicago Med open?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.144
- November 17th,

00:43.144 --> 00:44.878
but we got pushed a week.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.616
Something concerning, uh,
sconces, I believe.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.252
- Cool.
Can I ask you a question?

00:51.252 --> 00:53.754
I--do they still
call them "emergency rooms"?

00:53.754 --> 00:55.123
Because I heard that now

00:55.123 --> 00:57.291
they're calling them
"emergency departments."

00:57.291 --> 01:00.461
- The latter,
though I believe I'm the one

01:00.461 --> 01:04.132
who's supposed to be
asking you questions, no?

01:04.132 --> 01:07.501
Look, how 'bout I tell you

01:07.501 --> 01:09.303
what your sergeant
conveyed to me,

01:09.303 --> 01:10.938
as to what you've been
going through?

01:10.938 --> 01:14.041
And please let me know
if I'm off base in any way.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.609
Okay?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.844
- Okay.

01:16.844 --> 01:20.414
- Okay, so you were working
with a young lady

01:20.414 --> 01:25.553
who was killed,
which I was very sorry to hear.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.455
You took some time off,

01:27.455 --> 01:33.361
maybe partied a little bit
too much with your mother?

01:33.361 --> 01:35.596
Got your job back, uh,

01:35.596 --> 01:37.698
in the words of your sergeant,

01:37.698 --> 01:39.800
by the skin of your teeth.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.535
- Sounds about right.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.904
- Well, that's a lot
to live with.

01:43.904 --> 01:47.308
You know, I mean,
to carry around?

01:47.308 --> 01:49.777
So I don't know,
instead of, you know,

01:49.777 --> 01:54.348
trying to swallow the elephant
in one big gulp,

01:54.348 --> 01:56.384
we just, I don't know,

01:56.384 --> 01:59.187
go at it a bite at a time?

01:59.187 --> 02:01.289
[phone vibrates]

02:04.425 --> 02:07.195
- This just isn't for me, okay?

02:07.195 --> 02:09.797
No offense, but...

02:11.699 --> 02:14.868
I got a case.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.770
- Take care.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.742
- Sir.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.214
- Commander.

02:26.214 --> 02:29.082
- Barbara Fletcher showed up at
the Ivory Tower the other day--

02:29.082 --> 02:31.219
your mother, correct?

02:31.219 --> 02:32.286
- What did she want?

02:32.286 --> 02:34.988
- The name James Beckett
ring a bell?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.890
- Heroin dealer,
moved major kilos.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.493
Picked him off on a murder rap
15 years back.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.795
- Her mom is saying you lied
about witnessing Beckett

02:41.795 --> 02:42.830
kill the buyer that night.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.632
Said you were never
on the scene.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.567
- She's a drunk.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.536
I'll take my chances
on a he-said, she-said

02:48.536 --> 02:49.837
with Bunny Fletcher any day.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.472
- Yeah, well,
she says she has proof,

02:51.472 --> 02:54.642
so you might want to deal
with this before I have to.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.583
- I'll talk to her.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.751
- Look--

03:03.751 --> 03:05.052
- You know how long
I've been waiting?

03:05.052 --> 03:06.987
Every second that I'm here,
I am wasting time.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.021
I am wasting money--

03:08.021 --> 03:10.258
- Everybody shut up
and calm down!

03:10.258 --> 03:12.059
- I'm getting a ticket
when his cab hit me.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.561
- You slammed on your brakes
in an intersection, lady.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.628
- Of course I--

03:14.628 --> 03:15.863
- What'd she just say?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.498
Sarge, I got no problem
locking 'em both up.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.032
- Excuse me, Sergeant.
- Hey, I was here first.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.268
- One second.
If I have to tell you

03:20.268 --> 03:22.102
to stay calm again,
you're gonna be doing it

03:22.102 --> 03:24.037
handcuffed to that chair
over there.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.072
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sorry.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.073
- Buddy, you're gonna
have to wait.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.808
And you, Lady Pants,

03:27.808 --> 03:30.711
the citation is for leaving
your insurance card at--

03:30.711 --> 03:32.513
let me guess, the yoga studio.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.815
But if you want, we can impound
the vehicle and, you know,

03:34.815 --> 03:36.784
conserve paper, save the planet.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.785
- Look, I don't mean
to be pushy--

03:37.785 --> 03:39.287
- What do you want?

03:39.287 --> 03:40.454
- It's my daughter.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.522
She's missing.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.056
- How old is she?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.693
- She's 18, but she's never
been away from home--

03:45.693 --> 03:47.295
- Then technically,
she's an adult,

03:47.295 --> 03:48.962
so you'll have to go
to Missing Persons.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.764
That's Area Three,
Belmont and Western.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.733
- I already did that.
They sent me to District 30.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.302
District 30 sent me over here.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.769
- Can we get this
over with already?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.305
- Oh, I'm sorry,
is your meter running?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.307
- It's not.
That's the problem.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.008
- Will you please take a look
at this file?

04:01.008 --> 04:03.110
- Sir, Belmont and Western,
or take a seat.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.478
- Hey, Sarge.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.646
I need your signature
on this requisition form.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.847
Voight wants
new pinhole cameras.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.082
- He was very clear
about his instructions.

04:09.883 --> 04:10.818
You gonna send me back
empty-handed?

04:10.818 --> 04:12.185
- My daughter is missing!

04:12.185 --> 04:13.754
Sarah Frazier.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.323
She's been gone three months.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.659
- Sir, lower your voice
and back up.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.927
- Okay, it's really not
that big a deal.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.329
You just take that little pen--

[people screaming]

04:36.744 --> 04:37.911
- You drop that gun,
or we drop you!

04:37.911 --> 04:38.946
- I don't think so.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.714
- No one is dropping anyone.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.949
Get these people out of here.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.250
- Go, go, go, go, go!

04:43.250 --> 04:45.218
- Go with him.
Stay calm.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.387
- Sergeant, I got a shot.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.921
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:47.921 --> 04:50.558
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy.

04:50.558 --> 04:53.794
- Sir, whatever this is,
we can work it out.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.063
- I tried to do the right thing,

04:56.063 --> 04:59.400
but no one would listen!

04:59.400 --> 05:02.269
That's far enough!

05:02.269 --> 05:05.873
The cops in Iowa--the cops
in Iowa, they laughed at it.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.641
They said my daughter ran away.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.042
I know my daughter.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.378
She didn't run away.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.212
- So you walk
into a police district,

05:12.212 --> 05:14.515
pull a gun,
and take a hostage?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.384
You can't expect
to walk out of this.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.585
- I don't.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.453
And I don't give a damn.

05:19.453 --> 05:22.289
I gave my daughter a credit card
for emergencies.

05:22.289 --> 05:26.293
Now, someone here in Chicago
used it last week.

05:26.293 --> 05:29.262
That means she's here.
I know it.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.631
I know it.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.003
Everything's in there.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.572
- All right, good.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.477
Now you gotta release my guy.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.945
- Find Sarah.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.179
- That's not how it works.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.415
- That's how it works today!

05:47.415 --> 05:50.117
Anybody makes a move, he dies!

05:53.120 --> 05:55.423
- I'm cool.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.990
Everybody's cool.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.632
- Keep a bead on his forehead.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.134
He stops holding up his end
of the bargain, you drill him.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.301
You understand?

06:08.301 --> 06:09.437
- No problem.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.440
[dramatic music]

06:12.440 --> 06:20.481
*

06:21.449 --> 06:22.583
- [laughs]

06:22.583 --> 06:24.518
Thought you weren't allowed
to come near me.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.654
- This Beckett thing--
you got to stop.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.489
You have no idea
what you're doing.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.858
- You know, Hank lied
about where he was that night.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.793
Said he was at a stakeout
or something.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.361
You and I both know
that's not true.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.296
- Right, and why do we know
what's true?

06:36.296 --> 06:37.465
Tell me. Or can you?

06:37.465 --> 06:39.232
Is your memory of that night
a little fuzzy?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.601
- I had it under control.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.902
- Which part?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.571
The part where your boyfriend
was about to kill us

06:43.571 --> 06:45.338
with a sawed-off shotgun
before Hank showed up?

06:45.338 --> 06:47.140
- I've lived with this
long enough,

06:47.140 --> 06:51.144
knowing that Hank's lies
put an innocent man into prison.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.345
- He's not innocent, he--

06:52.345 --> 06:54.047
- Neither is Hank Voight!

06:54.047 --> 06:56.484
- Mom,

06:56.484 --> 07:00.488
I am asking you, please.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.289
- It's too late.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.057
I've already contacted
Beckett's attorneys,

07:04.057 --> 07:05.559
and they deposed me
this morning.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.695
- Are you kidding me?
Do you--

07:07.695 --> 07:10.998
[phone vibrates]
[sighs]

07:10.998 --> 07:11.999
You need to fix this.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.000
- I don't need to fix anything.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.602
- Bitch.

07:14.602 --> 07:18.238
- District is on lockdown,
and OEMC's been advised.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.608
I've rerouted all
in-service calls to the 26th,

07:20.608 --> 07:22.275
and I've got
five patrolmen sitting

07:22.275 --> 07:23.677
on the downstairs office.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.914
- Have those officers hold fast
until they deploy a sniper team

07:26.914 --> 07:28.148
and draw up an assault plan.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.717
- Yes, sir.
- What do we know?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.018
- Name's Jeff Frazier.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.820
He's 44, lives in Ankeny, Iowa.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.055
No criminal priors,
no history of mental illness.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.525
Last July, his daughter,
Sarah, disappeared.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.127
Three days later, they found her
car in an Amtrak parking lot.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.629
No record of her
ever buying a ticket.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.964
- Boss, credit card story
checks out.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.766
Three months of inactivity,
then Sarah's card

07:45.766 --> 07:50.904
bought five flat-screen TVs in
Little Village just last week.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.806
- Run with it.
- Got it.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.808
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.610
- That's my friend downstairs.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.045
Time comes for someone
to pull the trigger,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.446
it should be me, not SWAT.

07:59.446 --> 08:03.016
- If we're lucky,
nobody's pulling the trigger.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.985
[phone vibrates]

08:04.985 --> 08:06.687
- Justin.
- Pops, hey, yeah.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.088
We just got in right now.
I was, uh,

08:08.088 --> 08:09.857
I was actually thinking
about stopping by the district,

08:09.857 --> 08:11.925
showing little Daniel
where his grandpa works.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.794
- Yeah, now's not a good time.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.963
I was hoping we could meet
for dinner tonight.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.831
- Yeah, sure.
You good?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.332
- Yeah.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.902
I'm really looking forward
to seeing you guys.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.675
- Close the door.
Close the door.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.210
- Okay.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.648
- We already have our people
following up leads.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.015
You all good, buddy?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.618
- We're cool.
Everybody's cool.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.820
- Shut it!

08:39.820 --> 08:42.823
[dramatic music]

08:42.823 --> 08:43.857
*

08:43.857 --> 08:45.626
- Move that desk
in front of the door.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.695
Move!

08:47.695 --> 08:49.597
Let's go.
Let's go, come on.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.965
Close the blinds. Close them.
Shut them.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.204
Sit down.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.907
Sit down, sit down.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.210
- Somebody keeps
pointing a gun at me,

09:03.210 --> 09:04.211
I'd at least like
to get his name.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.412
- What do you care?

09:05.412 --> 09:07.047
- Oh, that's
an outrageous question to ask?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.048
My name's Greg Gerwitz.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.617
Everybody calls me Mouse.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.119
See--see, no big deal.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.855
- Frazier, Jeff Frazier.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.990
Now shut up.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.159
- Listen, I can help you
if you let me.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.729
- You're supposed to get me
to talk, right? Right?

09:21.729 --> 09:24.632
Build a rapport
with the hostage taker?

09:24.632 --> 09:27.434
Do some of that cop psych crap
they trained you for, huh?

09:27.434 --> 09:28.869
- No, I'm not a cop.
- You're not?

09:28.869 --> 09:31.104
- No, I'm a civilian employee
with the CPD.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.439
I got, like,
zero tactical value,

09:32.439 --> 09:33.440
if that's what you're thinking.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.643
- Shut up.

09:35.643 --> 09:38.078
- We're cool.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.379
[siren wails]

09:39.379 --> 09:42.515
- Secure the window
and all other points of entry.

09:42.515 --> 09:46.286
Greene, I want every squad out
of that lot and on the street,

09:46.286 --> 09:50.323
and move the bystanders
beyond the perimeters.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.159
[sighs]

09:56.163 --> 09:59.332
There was a guy who walked
into the 31st years back--

09:59.332 --> 10:00.367
bad domestic.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.637
- He had a .32 in his sock,

10:03.637 --> 10:05.673
killed his wife, a cop,
and then himself.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.608
- The district,
the front desk,

10:08.608 --> 10:11.044
it's a sacred place.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.512
If people don't feel safe
walking in there--

10:12.512 --> 10:16.917
- Trudy, this isn't gonna end
like that.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.319
- You make sure, Hank.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.923
- Had a problem
with shrinkage the last year,

10:22.923 --> 10:24.457
so we had this thing installed.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.926
Done the trick so far.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.661
- Pause right there.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.030
Transaction at 1:53 p.m.,
that's gotta be it.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.100
- Who's behind the register?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.468
- Randy!

10:35.468 --> 10:37.104
- Come here.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.708
Come on, come on, let's go.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.843
- This guy, he ever
come in here before this?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.211
- Nope.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.179
- Your boss tells us
you're supposed to require ID

10:46.179 --> 10:47.848
on any transaction over $100.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.850
This was over 3 grand.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.084
- We were busy.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.787
- So busy you followed him
out to the parking lot?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.455
- He needed help
with the flat screens.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.523
- Hey, hey.
Look at me.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.425
Here's the deal, Randy.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.093
I can't save your job.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.795
What I can do
is keep you out of Stateville

11:01.795 --> 11:03.130
for credit card fraud.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.565
Just tell me
where we can find your boy.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.272
- Oscar Mena?
- Yeah, what--hey!

11:12.272 --> 11:13.741
- Come on, bro.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.408
Sit down.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.977
You too.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.078
Where's Sarah?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.747
- Who the hell is Sarah?

11:19.747 --> 11:20.981
- Sarah's the girl

11:20.981 --> 11:23.183
whose credit card funded
this little shopping spree.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.617
- Man, I busted my hump

11:24.617 --> 11:26.887
for six months
at Jiffy Lube for all this.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.055
I'm a shift manager.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.522
- I swear,
if you be stepping out on me--

11:29.522 --> 11:30.523
- Relax.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.792
Your homeboy already told us

11:31.792 --> 11:33.593
that you rolled through the shop
with stolen plastic.

11:33.593 --> 11:34.928
So where'd you get
Sarah's card, dog?

11:34.928 --> 11:36.296
- I'm telling you,
I don't know no Sarah--

11:36.296 --> 11:37.364
- Listen, man,
we don't have time for this.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.498
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.768
Just come clean, now,

11:40.768 --> 11:42.202
or we're gonna
turn this place inside out,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.404
and I will find a felony
to shove down your throat.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.672
You too, honey.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.674
- Oh, hell no,
I ain't going to jail for him.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.409
- Bitch, don't say a word.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.178
- Here, talk to me.
Talk to me.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.481
- Oscar broke into a car
last week out in Humboldt Park,

11:54.481 --> 11:56.383
and the credit card
was in a purse he grabbed.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.118
- All right, where?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.790
- Said the car was parked here--
white 4Runner.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.924
There's only a hundred
in the state,

12:03.924 --> 12:06.459
none registered
to this block.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.295
No record of a break-in either.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.802
- Someone doesn't call in
a break-in or a stolen purse,

12:14.802 --> 12:17.404
sounds like someone doesn't want
to deal with the cops.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.406
Let's check the pods,
knock on every door.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.208
If somebody gives off
a bad vibe, we close in.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.712
- Hey, does this look weird
to you?

12:25.712 --> 12:26.814
It's dry as a bone.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.216
These are
brand-new sprinkler heads.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.219
[dramatic music]

12:32.219 --> 12:40.828
*

12:40.828 --> 12:42.595
- Is that a periscope?

12:42.595 --> 12:45.398
- Burgess--Burgess, Roman,
take the back.

12:45.398 --> 12:52.840
*

12:52.840 --> 12:53.874
- Clear!

12:53.874 --> 12:55.876
- Clear!

12:55.876 --> 13:03.984
*

13:09.722 --> 13:11.024
- Clear!

13:11.024 --> 13:12.960
- Basement!

13:14.427 --> 13:15.896
Clear!

13:15.896 --> 13:17.730
- Clear!

13:27.875 --> 13:29.877
- That's the one you found,

13:29.877 --> 13:31.544
plus views of the front
and back doors.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.546
- Over here!

13:40.387 --> 13:46.126
*

13:53.901 --> 13:54.001
.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.371
[indistinct chatter and sirens]

14:11.118 --> 14:14.254
- When did you serve?

14:15.588 --> 14:18.558
Your sidearm--
it's military issue.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.260
M9.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.931
When I asked you your name,
you said your last name first.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.301
I was Rangers.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.602
75th Regiment.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.504
I did...

14:31.504 --> 14:33.640
two tours
in the Korengal Valley.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.212
- Marines.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.982
Gunnery sergeant,
sixth Division.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.618
Took a few strolls
through Baghdad.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.554
I was gone pretty much
from the time

14:47.554 --> 14:50.958
Sarah was born till she got
her learner's permit.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.493
- That's--that's got
to be hard.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.164
- You did it.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.766
You got me talking.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.437
Your sergeant
looking for Sarah...

15:04.437 --> 15:06.573
can I trust him?

15:06.573 --> 15:10.477
- Hank Voight?

15:10.477 --> 15:11.711
Picking his district

15:11.711 --> 15:14.447
was about the only thing
that you did right today.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.288
- Yo, ambos just left.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.855
Patrol's on their way
to Chicago Med

15:22.855 --> 15:24.157
with the girls right now.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.458
- They give you anything
on Sarah?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.260
- Honestly, with all that dope
pumped in 'em,

15:27.260 --> 15:28.661
they didn't remember
their own names.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.863
- Asset Foreclosure says
the place is owned

15:30.863 --> 15:34.167
by a Nevada shell company,
operated by a Bahamian trust.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.336
- Means it's gonna be days
before we get the owner's name.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.604
- Yeah.
- All right.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.672
Have a covert car sit on
the house in case he comes back.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.874
- Okay.
Got it.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.147
- When we find this guy...

15:49.882 --> 15:52.252
I want five minutes
alone with him.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.022
- You're gonna have
to wait in line.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.789
- Ligature marks
on their wrists and ankles

15:56.789 --> 15:58.291
indicate they were bound.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.693
Contusions on their legs
and back,

16:00.693 --> 16:02.362
along with vaginal tearing.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.031
These girls
have been through hell.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.532
- All right, thank you.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.701
- Hey, um,
what's up at the district?

16:08.701 --> 16:11.904
- Voight's keeping a cap on.

16:11.904 --> 16:12.905
- I, um--

16:12.905 --> 16:15.808
you know, when Jay came back,

16:15.808 --> 16:17.477
I wasn't there for him.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.146
The only friend
he had was Mouse,

16:19.146 --> 16:23.216
who, believe it or not,
was the one who dragged Jay home

16:23.216 --> 16:25.652
when he was going through--

16:25.652 --> 16:28.255
- Through what?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.957
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.792
You guys brought them in?
- Yeah.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.062
- Did you notify the parents?
- She's saying don't bother.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.863
She hasn't spoken
to either in years.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.498
But she had us
call her sister.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.400
- All right.
Thanks, Will.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.435
Come with me.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.741
Listen, I know that the last
thing you want to do right now

16:48.741 --> 16:53.613
is relive any
of what you've been through,

16:53.613 --> 16:57.617
but anything you can tell us
is gonna help us catch this guy.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.228
- His name's Trevor.

17:08.228 --> 17:12.699
We met through Facebook
of all things.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.702
He was older.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.936
Handsome.

17:20.607 --> 17:24.144
He sent me a bus ticket,
and I came to be with him.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.880
- I know guys like Trevor.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.250
They prey on you,

17:30.250 --> 17:34.354
and they know just how to make
you feel special, right?

17:34.354 --> 17:37.624
Any details you can remember

17:37.624 --> 17:40.593
are gonna help us make sure
he never does this again.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.765
- He picked me up
at the station.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.139
Took me to dinner, said he knew
a great steakhouse.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.043
Then we went back to his place.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.611
He put something in my drink,

17:58.611 --> 18:03.316
because next thing I know,
he's on top of m-me.

18:07.187 --> 18:11.524
- Uh, was this girl...

18:11.524 --> 18:13.926
was she one of the ones
with you?

18:18.265 --> 18:20.500
- Sarah.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.703
- Just got word from Voight.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.038
Commander's getting itchy
with SWAT.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.074
Frazier's not backing down.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.883
- Frazier!

18:36.883 --> 18:40.387
Frazier, I have someone here
who knows your daughter,

18:40.387 --> 18:43.256
and she wants to talk to you.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.391
- Who?

18:44.391 --> 18:45.525
- Just open the door.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.260
You have my word.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.062
I'm being straight.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.870
- You were right.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.206
Sarah didn't run away.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.609
She was kidnapped,
along with this girl

19:02.609 --> 19:06.613
and at least three other girls
we know of.

19:06.613 --> 19:10.317
- Frazier, just open the door.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.822
- She's alive.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.823
She was.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.824
- How am I supposed to believe--

19:17.824 --> 19:19.826
- Blue Lake.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.431
She told me about Blue Lake.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.243
She said that
there was a cabin there

19:36.243 --> 19:38.345
that her family
would go to, right?

19:41.481 --> 19:45.084
They couldn't break her.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.085
- What did they do?

19:46.085 --> 19:47.520
- And I feel bad,

19:47.520 --> 19:52.425
because sometimes I would just
tell her to do what they wanted,

19:52.425 --> 19:53.826
so they wouldn't hurt her.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.764
But she wouldn't do it.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.536
- She's alive?

20:03.536 --> 20:04.737
- We think so.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.039
We're close.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.109
- If you have a shot,
take a shot.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.050
- If you found her,
why didn't you find Sarah?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.185
- We're following leads.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.287
It's like peeling an onion.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.722
We're close.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.593
- On the ground!
Don't move!

20:26.593 --> 20:27.860
On the ground!

20:27.860 --> 20:30.263
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground.

20:30.263 --> 20:33.433
Put your hands
behind your head.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.468
[handcuffs click]

20:35.468 --> 20:38.871
What took you so long?

20:38.871 --> 20:41.007
- I believed him.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.942
- We still got
a missing girl to find.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.777
- All right, let's go.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.252
- Three girls
found in Humboldt Park

20:53.252 --> 20:56.255
were all lured to Chicago
via this Romeo's Facebook page.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.926
Trevor Dunn,
sometimes Crowhill or Donnelly.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.061
The accounts go dark
once the girls disappear,

21:02.061 --> 21:04.531
but we pulled this photo
from Julia's cloud storage.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.899
- No hits off NCIC or the DMV.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.335
- Sergeant Benson in New York

21:08.335 --> 21:11.137
says that Trevor is likely using
these videos he shot

21:11.137 --> 21:13.340
as selling material
to pimps that are looking

21:13.340 --> 21:15.442
for girl-next-door types
for their organizations.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.943
- I took the photo
we got from Julia,

21:16.943 --> 21:18.478
ran a reverse image search
on it.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.813
Found an online dating profile
using the same pic,

21:20.813 --> 21:23.082
so I accessed it.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.651
What?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.419
All right, I had the tech lab
at Organized Crime do it.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.356
Anyway, I'm scrolling
through his messages right now.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.858
Looks like he's picking up
another girl, a Lacy Collins.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.125
Bought her a bus ticket.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.728
She gets into downtown
on the 946 from St. Paul.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.365
- Hit it.

21:38.365 --> 21:41.601
- Hank.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.736
I-I tried talking to Bunny.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.072
She already spoke
to Beckett's lawyers.

21:49.776 --> 21:54.013
Can't help but think
that this is on me.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.849
- This is all Bunny.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.829
- No sign of Trevor.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.398
Anyone got eyes?

22:11.398 --> 22:13.400
Anyone see Trevor?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.403
- Negative.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.644
The 946 is here.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.554
- Anyone see Trevor?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.489
- Yeah, we got eyes.

22:42.795 --> 22:43.796
- Hey.

22:43.796 --> 22:44.831
- Trev?

22:44.831 --> 22:46.032
- Hey--oh, excuse me.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.567
- [laughs]

22:47.567 --> 22:48.601
- That's the girl.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.870
- Trevor?
- What's up, Lace?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.972
Hi. Uh, yes.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.607
[both laugh]
Uh...

22:54.607 --> 22:56.676
Uh, you must be starving.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.277
I have reservations
at the Signature Room.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.446
- Oh.

22:59.446 --> 23:02.014
- 96 stories above the city.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.315
- Okay.
- You'll love it.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.452
- Okay.
- Allow me.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.086
Best meat you've ever tasted.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.760
- Lacy?

23:13.760 --> 23:16.863
I'm with the Chicago Police.
Are you okay?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.598
- Yeah.
- I need you to come with me.

23:18.598 --> 23:21.634
- Come see Chicago.
See Chicago. Come on.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.939
- Where you going, pal?

23:30.042 --> 23:32.378
- Trevor Dunn?
- Nope.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.513
Ah!

23:33.513 --> 23:35.548
- I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.116
Trevor Dunn?

23:37.116 --> 23:38.818
- Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, that's me.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.119
That's me.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.254
- Where's Sarah Frazier?
- I-I don't know, man.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.023
I swear to God.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.659
Ah! Ah!

23:46.659 --> 23:48.260
- That dungeon we found?

23:48.260 --> 23:51.197
It's a little slice of heaven
compared to where you're going.

23:54.501 --> 23:54.601
.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.939
- You the medic?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.976
[grunts]

24:03.976 --> 24:05.812
- Hmm.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.391
Look familiar?

24:19.391 --> 24:20.793
- I'm telling you, these girls,
they come to me.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.161
They don't like the path
they're on.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.565
I give 'em a chance
to start over, make some cash.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.233
It...

24:27.233 --> 24:28.535
- So...

24:28.535 --> 24:31.804
so what's this for?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.306
- Scare tactics.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.708
- Mm.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.044
Yeah, I've heard of those.

24:40.547 --> 24:43.149
Me?

24:43.149 --> 24:47.887
I prefer
actual physical violence.

24:47.887 --> 24:51.591
[both grunting]

24:51.591 --> 24:52.992
Yeah.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.462
- [wails]

24:56.462 --> 24:57.597
- Yeah.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.866
Look at me.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.001
Hey, look at me.

25:04.737 --> 25:05.772
Where's Sarah Frazier?

25:05.772 --> 25:07.239
- I'm just a middleman.

25:07.239 --> 25:11.911
I bring in the girls,
but I don't run them.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.613
- Huh.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.447
- [screams]
I don't run them!

25:15.447 --> 25:16.949
- Give me a name.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.918
- If he knows I've been pinched,

25:18.918 --> 25:21.954
she's gone already.

25:21.954 --> 25:25.024
[screams]

25:25.024 --> 25:27.059
- A name.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.329
- [groans]

25:30.329 --> 25:31.731
- Steven Ulrich.

25:31.731 --> 25:34.266
Priors for distribution,
agg assault.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.468
Been linked
to a few missing girls.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.605
- Now Vice likes him
for involuntary servitude

25:38.605 --> 25:39.772
and sex trafficking.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.741
He holds on to girls
until they're worn out,

25:41.741 --> 25:43.743
then trades them to networks
across the country.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.878
- Trevor says
Ulrich is operating a brothel

25:45.878 --> 25:47.413
out of a club in Bridgeport.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.381
- Hank.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.416
- Yeah?

25:50.416 --> 25:51.984
- I got
a state's attorney downstairs

25:51.984 --> 25:54.186
who says he needs
to talk to you right now.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.722
- I got this.
We'll gear up.

25:55.722 --> 25:56.923
- Thanks.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.127
- Sergeant,
I know you've had a busy day.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.630
- Well, it's not over.
Let's make it quick.

26:03.630 --> 26:06.465
- James Beckett's
being released from prison.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.367
Figured I'd tell you
in person.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.102
Beckett's attorneys
petitioned a judge

26:10.102 --> 26:12.438
based on
Ms. Fletcher's testimony.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.942
Conviction's been vacated
pending a retrial.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.543
- So try him again.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.845
- It's not gonna happen.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.880
My boss was the lead prosecutor
in that case,

26:20.880 --> 26:22.649
and I'm not exposing him
to the blowback.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.016
- So this is politics?

26:24.016 --> 26:25.885
- Oh, this is a lot of things,
not the least of which is

26:25.885 --> 26:30.156
you risking a Rule 14 violation
for making a false statement.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.124
You really want to end your
career in the property room?

26:32.124 --> 26:34.727
- To keep a scumbag like Beckett
off my streets,

26:34.727 --> 26:35.795
you bet your ass.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.929
- Well, you should've
thought about that

26:36.929 --> 26:38.665
before you ditched
a three-week-long surveillance

26:38.665 --> 26:40.733
to deal with a domestic.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.368
Ink's dry.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.403
They're releasing him
in an hour.

26:49.141 --> 26:52.244
- We're not gonna stop
looking for your daughter.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.915
I just wanted you to know.

27:01.754 --> 27:05.291
- I lost my house
after the first tour.

27:07.894 --> 27:11.864
Wife left after the second.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.599
I could handle all that.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.473
But not being there
for my daughter...

27:26.412 --> 27:30.349
If this is the one thing
I can do

27:30.349 --> 27:32.618
as a father,

27:32.618 --> 27:34.954
the one thing...

27:37.589 --> 27:40.126
Then here we are.

27:42.895 --> 27:46.198
- We're gonna find her.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.368
I give you my word.

27:49.368 --> 27:53.740
- I'm sorry...
for dragging you into this.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.544
Man to man.

Hey, come here. Come here.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.592
- The party, it's over.

28:13.592 --> 28:14.660
- It's all right.

28:14.660 --> 28:17.964
- I got her.
I got her.

28:17.964 --> 28:20.366
- Clear.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.400
- Oh.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.135
- Ruzek?

28:24.503 --> 28:25.772
- Move up.

28:25.772 --> 28:26.973
- Jay.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.675
- Clear.
- Clear.

28:29.675 --> 28:31.643
- Ruz, go.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.212
- Clear.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.213
- Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

28:34.213 --> 28:35.815
- Chicago Police!
Who are you?

28:35.815 --> 28:37.817
- That bitch--
she shot me.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.119
- Where's Ulrich?
- He's out back.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.095
- It's Ulrich.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.964
- Chicago Police!
Sarah, is that you?

28:51.964 --> 28:54.033
- [sobbing]
Help me!

28:54.033 --> 28:56.969
Help me!

29:01.808 --> 29:03.843
- It's okay.

29:03.843 --> 29:04.844
- [cries]

29:04.844 --> 29:06.178
- It's over.
It's all right.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.613
You're safe now.
It's over. It's over.

29:07.613 --> 29:10.682
It's over. It's over.
It's over.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.118
- Sarah Frazier.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.553
Was she here?

29:14.553 --> 29:17.423
- What happened?
Is she hurt?

29:21.160 --> 29:23.830
- Ulrich...
[cries]

29:23.830 --> 29:27.266
He was gonna
dump us off somewhere.

29:27.266 --> 29:32.371
But Sarah, she grabbed his gun.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.673
She shot him.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.943
- CTA just reported a female,
white, late teens

29:36.943 --> 29:39.111
boarded an L train at Lake
and Ashland with a handgun.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.419

29:57.997 --> 29:59.765

Come on. Come on.

29:59.765 --> 30:00.766
- Go, go, go.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.101
- Intelligence.
We got it from here.

- Hey.

30:51.417 --> 30:55.087
My name's Erin Lindsay.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.324
I'm with
the Chicago Police Department.

30:58.324 --> 31:01.227
I'm gonna come in, okay?

31:03.462 --> 31:06.098
We're here to help.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.734
There's a lot of people
that are looking for you.

31:14.740 --> 31:18.110
Sarah?

31:18.110 --> 31:20.947
- You know my name?

31:20.947 --> 31:23.950
- I know
all about what happened to you.

31:23.950 --> 31:27.319
- No, you don't.

31:27.319 --> 31:31.423
- I know about Trevor,
and I know what he did.

- [crying]

31:38.197 --> 31:41.200
- Sarah?

31:41.200 --> 31:45.137
Listen, he's in jail.
Okay?

31:45.137 --> 31:47.039
He's never gonna hurt
anybody again.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.707
- It's too late.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.609
- It's not.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.881
Sarah, I need you
to do something for me, okay?

31:55.881 --> 31:57.984
Can you put the gun down?

31:57.984 --> 32:00.152
Sarah?

32:00.152 --> 32:04.323
These two officers
behind me are a little nervous.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.725
They're afraid
you're gonna hurt someone.

32:06.725 --> 32:11.097
- I can't live with this.

32:11.097 --> 32:14.500
- Sarah.

32:14.500 --> 32:20.006
Sarah, I just need you
to hold on, okay?

32:20.006 --> 32:21.173
Can you do that for me?

32:21.173 --> 32:25.144
Can you hold on
for just ten minutes?

32:27.479 --> 32:29.615
Okay.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.417
[whispers] Call Voight.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.723
- We have the girl,
but we need the father.

32:37.723 --> 32:41.460
She has a gun, looking like
she wants to end it.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.195
You have my word,
the situation

32:43.195 --> 32:47.166
will be contained
the whole time.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.268

32:53.605 --> 32:56.075
- She's alive?
- Yeah, but we got to move.

Turn around.

Come on.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.484

- What's happening?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.785

doing their jobs.

Keep your eyes on me.

You're stronger than this,
and I know you know that.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.877
The girls that you were with,
we have them.

33:31.877 --> 33:35.081
They told me that you're
the only one that never broke.

33:35.081 --> 33:39.818
You're a fighter,
and you know that.

33:39.818 --> 33:42.788
Sarah, just hang on.

33:42.788 --> 33:50.462
*

33:50.462 --> 33:54.566
Can you look outside for me
right now?

33:54.566 --> 33:56.202
- Go ahead.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.303
- Sarah, look outside.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.937
Your dad's here.

33:58.937 --> 34:01.773
- Sarah.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.843
It's okay.
You're safe.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.213
It's all right.
Everything's gonna be okay.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.614
- You came for me.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.216
- Of course I did.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.884
I never gave up.
Never.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.420
- [cries]

34:14.420 --> 34:15.853
- Never.

34:15.853 --> 34:20.525
*

34:20.525 --> 34:21.860
- Give 'em a minute?

34:32.138 --> 34:32.237
.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.177
- You wanted to see me, sir?

34:40.146 --> 34:41.880
- You did good in there today.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.484
- He wasn't a killer,
sir, just desperate.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.286
- I stared down the barrel
of that gun

34:47.286 --> 34:50.021
when he first took you hostage.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.022
- Sir?

34:51.022 --> 34:53.292
- Which is odd,

34:53.292 --> 34:54.760
because when you turned it in
to evidence,

34:54.760 --> 34:56.061
it was unloaded,

34:56.061 --> 34:59.498
no bullets in the magazine,

34:59.498 --> 35:04.203
which reduces his charge
to reckless endangerment.

35:04.203 --> 35:07.005
- Huh.

35:07.005 --> 35:09.908
- You never saw Frazier load
or unload that weapon.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.479
- No, Sergeant.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.315
It must have been empty
the whole time.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.918
- Hmm.

35:19.918 --> 35:23.189
Then, go ahead and reflect that
in your write-up.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.093
- Yes, Sergeant.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.332
- [sighs]

35:40.071 --> 35:42.374
- Wasn't loaded, huh?

35:48.447 --> 35:50.649
- You, uh--
you remember when Hollingsworth,

35:50.649 --> 35:52.951
he got kidnapped
by those hajis?

36:04.062 --> 36:07.333
When we finally tracked 'em
down, what did we do?

36:09.034 --> 36:11.970
- A lot worse than put a gun
to someone's head.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.674
- Yeah.

36:15.674 --> 36:19.511
- Hey,
to extenuating circumstances.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.587
- [mumbles]

36:28.587 --> 36:30.155
[soul music playing]

36:30.155 --> 36:32.524
- Hey, you Antonio?

36:32.524 --> 36:33.625
- [sighs]

36:33.625 --> 36:34.893
You know, do yourself a favor.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.429
Don't ever open a boxing gym.

36:39.465 --> 36:42.133
- Hey, my dad told me to, uh,
stop by here.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.303
- Yeah?

36:44.303 --> 36:46.338
- Alvin Olinsky?

36:51.443 --> 36:52.778
- Cool.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.015
Cool.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.287
Uh...

37:01.287 --> 37:03.522
hmm.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.957
You ever do any boxing before?

37:05.957 --> 37:10.061
- Well, nothing,
you know, like, official.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.863
- All right.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.132
Let's see what you got.

37:15.601 --> 37:19.505
- He didn't tell you
he was my dad, did he?

37:19.505 --> 37:22.474
- Uh, you know, the thing
you need to know about Al

37:22.474 --> 37:25.143
is, he, uh...

37:25.143 --> 37:27.212
sometimes it takes a while.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.617
Does his family know?

37:35.554 --> 37:38.023
Wow, okay.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.625
Come on, do that again.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.826
- Okay.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.729
- Come on.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.131
Ah! Nice.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.776
- There's a young girl,
15 years old,

37:57.776 --> 38:00.779
and she's my daughter.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.916
Her mom was going away
to prison.

38:04.916 --> 38:08.787
She has nobody else.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.490
And--and this was
a long time ago,

38:11.490 --> 38:14.893
back when
I was working undercover.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.762
I was lost.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.670
- You need to leave now.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.372
- Mom!

38:31.610 --> 38:32.878
- Lexi.

38:32.878 --> 38:36.815
Lexi, please...

38:36.815 --> 38:40.118
'cause I can't lose you.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.252
I can't lose you.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.689
- [crying]

38:43.689 --> 38:46.057
- I can't.

38:46.057 --> 38:49.060
[soft music]

38:49.060 --> 38:56.668
*

38:56.668 --> 39:00.406
[alternative music playing]

39:00.406 --> 39:04.009
- * Remember the silence

39:04.009 --> 39:07.913
* Remember the day

39:07.913 --> 39:08.914
* They burned
all the lights out *

39:08.914 --> 39:10.315
- [chuckles]

39:10.315 --> 39:15.421
- * And they came
to take us away *

39:15.421 --> 39:16.922
* So sing it out loud now

39:16.922 --> 39:19.224
- My mom...

39:21.192 --> 39:22.227
[chuckles]

39:22.227 --> 39:25.130
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.264
- If it's any comfort,

39:26.264 --> 39:30.068
I guarantee you
I've heard worse.

39:30.068 --> 39:34.473
- Well, maybe someday I'll bore
you with all the sordid details.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.776
- Where's your dad?

39:37.776 --> 39:41.312
- I don't know.

39:41.312 --> 39:44.115
He was in and out of prison
a lot, and then...

39:44.115 --> 39:46.585
Albuquerque?

39:46.585 --> 39:48.754
I don't know.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.456
I didn't--I didn't
come over here to talk.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.925
I-I just wanted to apologize
for cutting out on you like that

39:53.925 --> 39:56.462
this morning.

39:56.462 --> 39:57.696
You reached out
to try to help me,

39:57.696 --> 40:01.099
and I appreciate that,
so thanks.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.804
- We don't get
to choose our parents.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.807
[soft music]

40:08.807 --> 40:16.815
*

40:16.815 --> 40:20.285
- Sometimes we do.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.320
- I want to thank the people
who never lost faith in me

40:22.320 --> 40:24.189
and assure the citizens
of Chicago

40:24.189 --> 40:26.758
that I look forward to getting
my life back on track.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.827
I found God's grace
in that prison cell,

40:28.827 --> 40:32.063
and even though I kneeled down
a sinner, I got up a Christian.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.865
For that,
I'll always be thankful.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.433
Thank you.
- One more question.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.968
[reporters chattering]

40:36.968 --> 40:41.139
[baby cries]

40:41.139 --> 40:42.608
- Sorry about that.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.875
Little quick change,
and now we're ready to rock.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.477
- Appreciate you taking us
to dinner, Hank.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.979
I hope you don't mind
someplace family-friendly.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.781
- Are you kidding?

40:49.781 --> 40:52.283
I'll take Rainforest Cafe
anytime I get to see

40:52.283 --> 40:54.786
my only grandkid.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.557
- Hey, Pop, after dinner,
I'm gonna bounce, okay?

40:58.557 --> 40:59.958
Leave you with Olive
and the little nipper.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.828
I'm gonna meet up
with the fellas.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.100
- Be there for him.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.236
- Yeah, of course, Pop.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.338
Of course.

41:13.338 --> 41:16.341
[soft music]

41:16.341 --> 41:24.382
*

41:30.355 --> 41:32.357
[buzzing]

41:32.357 --> 41:34.325
- Get down!
