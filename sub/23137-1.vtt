turkey this year.

I assume you mean

04:16.390 --> 04:18.957
understanding when you cancel on
dates because you have to work?

04:19.059 --> 04:21.627
Okay, so I was
a little preoccupied.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.429
But to be honest with you,
we weren't a good fit.

good choices, right?

04:34.208 --> 04:36.275

you're dating,

04:36.377 --> 04:38.577

you're 18 again.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.480
- It's amazing.
- But sooner or later,

04:41.582 --> 04:44.216
you realize
that you're not 18 again.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.951

I'm done with you.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.465
Merry Christmas!

What is this?

05:04.071 --> 05:05.771
A Christmas cruise?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.839
It's a five-day boat trip

05:07.941 --> 05:09.941
from San Pedro,
the port of Los Angeles,

05:10.044 --> 05:12.844
to this tiny little island about
200 miles out on the Pacific.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.580
It's a resort called
Christmas Island.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.683
- Oh.
- It's just one day there,

05:17.785 --> 05:19.618
three days on the island,
and one day back.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.564
My designer friend got me
tickets for me and a date,

05:21.588 --> 05:22.854
and I don't have a date

05:22.956 --> 05:24.334
so I figured
I'd bring my best friend

05:24.358 --> 05:26.291
and find a date on the boat.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.126
She even got me tickets to LA.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.795
It's really called
Christmas Island?

05:29.897 --> 05:31.797
Yeah, it's a theme resort.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.933
Oh, let me guess the theme.
Pirates? Arrr!

05:35.035 --> 05:36.802
It's gonna be amazing, okay?

05:36.904 --> 05:38.704
It's only open
one month out of the year,

05:38.806 --> 05:42.007
and they've got nightclubs
and surfing, diving,

05:42.109 --> 05:44.443
tours of the island,
and lots of single guys,

05:44.545 --> 05:45.944
all Christmas themed.

05:46.046 --> 05:49.181
Santa Claus?
Not my kind of cute.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.550
No, the cruise
is Christmas themed.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.985

It'll be so fun.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.488
Becky, it sounds like
an amazing present,

05:56.590 --> 05:59.191
but this time of the year
for me getting off work,

05:59.293 --> 06:01.360
I just can't take off
a week and...

06:01.462 --> 06:03.128
go out to California
with you.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.130
Hear me out.
The cruise leaves in two days.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.912
We'll just fly out to LA,
go on the cruise,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.834

by next week,

06:08.936 --> 06:11.081

admit it or not,

08:13.794 --> 08:15.794
That's exactly
what I was going for.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.596
Yeah, but it's boring.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.531
Boring?

08:19.633 --> 08:22.367
Yeah, well, not the writing.
It's just the subject matter.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.302
I mean, it's just like,
the millennial thing

08:24.404 --> 08:25.871

I always hated that thing
because it's like the news.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.675

take the dirt out of the news.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.099
It's a whole thing.
What are you working on now?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.569
Um, I am finishing up
the article

09:30.671 --> 09:32.070

No, I love dogs.
Don't like Syracuse.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.920
but here's what we need.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.089
We need something
that's just young and sexy.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.192
Look, young doesn't always
equal sexy, sweetie.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.760
It's just that...

09:55.862 --> 09:57.395
Nah, you're right.
I'll give you that.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.930
Let me try
something different then.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.465
I'll make it very simple.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.767
You bring me what I need,
and I will make you

10:02.869 --> 10:05.470
<i>New York Minute's</i>
managing editor.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.543
You serious?

10:11.645 --> 10:13.278
Managing editor?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.714
I already told you that
you're my favorite writer here.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.148
What do you say?

10:17.250 --> 10:19.651
What do you want me to do?

10:19.753 --> 10:21.686
I have no idea.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.255
I have no idea.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.458
Hey, holidays are coming up.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.994
Yes! It's like a romance,

10:29.062 --> 10:31.096
finding love
during the holidays piece.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.031
You're single, right?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.968
Yeah, but, um...

10:37.070 --> 10:38.937
I have to be honest with you.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.550
I just don't think
that I'm a good fit for this

10:40.574 --> 10:44.175
because my love life
is nothing to write about.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.678
That is very sad to hear.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.114
All right, well, you know,
it's actually not a bad thing

10:49.216 --> 10:50.927
because then it becomes
a wish fulfillment piece,

10:50.951 --> 10:54.152
where a single woman is trying
to navigate the landscape

10:54.254 --> 10:56.454
during
the Christmastime holiday,

10:56.556 --> 10:59.090
and that is what our readers
will connect to,

10:59.192 --> 11:00.759
so it's very good
that a woman your age

11:00.861 --> 11:03.028
is writing this article.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.596
My age?

11:04.698 --> 11:07.465
How old do you think I am?

11:07.567 --> 11:09.334
You are a very beautiful,
talented,

11:09.436 --> 11:11.136
and sophisticated woman.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.971
Good save. Thank you.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.351
And there are other beautiful,
talented, sophisticated women

11:15.375 --> 11:17.676
who are gonna be very alone
during the holiday.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.545
Why? Because it's just
impossible to meet anybody

11:20.647 --> 11:23.281
worth a pint of
pomegranate juice in this city,

11:23.383 --> 11:25.216
so we just need
to put you in a place

11:25.318 --> 11:28.586
where we know that
it's gonna be a done deal.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.190
Me? You're gonna put me?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.659
It's like an undercover exposé,

11:34.761 --> 11:36.739
where we don't want them
to know that you're a reporter.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.997
We want them
just to see you as a...

11:39.099 --> 11:41.299
Beautiful, talented,
sophisticated woman.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.635
- Yes! Exactly.
- Gotcha.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.581
It's just we gotta brainstorm
where you're gonna go.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.539
- Okay, where?
- I don't know!

11:47.641 --> 11:51.509
We just gotta send you somewhere
that's warm and tropical

11:51.611 --> 11:53.378
and like an escape.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.979
It's gotta be an escape.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.716
Tropical and warm, huh?

11:57.818 --> 12:00.518
You know, it's gotta be like
where you find love, you know,

12:00.620 --> 12:03.488
and then it's an adventure.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.257

12:33.120 --> 12:35.420
Never. My family
was more into camping.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.388
Our vacations were
always at state parks.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.824
Are the waves gonna be choppy?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.938
No, this ship's so big,
you won't even feel the waves.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.428
Good.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.863

13:21.735 --> 13:23.735
Do you know they serve

Are you taking the cruise

13:40.921 --> 13:42.387
Hi.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.066

on the Christmas cruise?

13:44.090 --> 13:45.990
It's my first time

13:51.398 --> 13:54.499
Can I please just take down
a few notes? Please?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.801
Only if you promise
to go just a few hours

13:56.870 --> 13:58.236
without jotting
something down.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.237
You got it.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.516

14:00.540 --> 14:01.973

failing you that much

that you have to write
everything down?

14:05.378 --> 14:08.646
- I just wanna be accurate.
- Accurate?

14:08.748 --> 14:10.827
Your news reporting is starting
to affect your journaling.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.283
You really need
to rethink this job.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.752
There's gonna be a change soon.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.121
Good. And if you don't
put that up when you're done,

16:08.668 --> 16:10.568

they give me noise

16:10.670 --> 16:14.105

16:20.213 --> 16:24.449
Me too!
What a crazy coincidence, huh?

16:24.551 --> 16:27.051
So are you writing an article
about the cruise?

16:27.153 --> 16:30.355

Oh.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.003

You're the cruise director.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.940
That I am.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.653
And listen, I wish I could
continue this conversation.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.577
I love having it with you,
but it's gotta wait

16:52.679 --> 16:57.015
because I have places to go
and people to greet

16:57.117 --> 17:00.118
and miles to go
before I sleep.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.153
That's Robert Frost, you know.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.288

17:04.391 --> 17:06.691

the cruise, relax,

17:06.792 --> 17:09.827

17:14.701 --> 17:15.867
What?

17:16.002 --> 17:18.036
I thought this would be
good for you.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.005
Oh, come on.
He's the cruise director.

17:21.107 --> 17:23.473
He just ditched me to go
and be with everyone else.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.542
Seemed pretty friendly.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.713
That's my point.
He's friendly with everyone.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.882
But you're not always
friendly with everyone,

17:30.984 --> 17:32.717
and that looked like
an ice breaker to me.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.186
Isn't it against the rules

17:35.288 --> 17:37.522
for the crew
to fraternize with passengers?

17:37.624 --> 17:40.792
Yes, and I think it's about time
you started breaking the rules.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.528
And there's a couple rules
I'd like to break myself.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.964
Becky!

17:47.067 --> 17:50.468
I am really blown away
at how big the boat is.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.237
We're gonna have a blast.
I know I'm excited.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.373
- So we're 302, right?
- 302.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.908
Here we go!

17:57.010 --> 18:00.878
Oh!

18:00.980 --> 18:02.947
I love this color.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.852
I love the bed.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.524
And where am I
supposed to sleep?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.795
You know
I like sleeping alone.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.697
There must've been
some kind of mistake.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.433
Yeah, I'll say. I'll just go
talk to the cruise manager.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.169
- Purser
- Purser, cruise manager,

18:25.271 --> 18:27.205
whosever in charge
of the beds.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.674
I'll just tell them
to give us another room.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.943
Wait! Let's check out
the view.

18:35.949 --> 18:36.848
Ohh!

18:36.950 --> 18:38.249
Come! Get over here!

18:38.351 --> 18:40.685
Okay.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.787
I don't wanna switch rooms
if we have to lose this.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.456
Oh, it is beautiful.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.025

still gonna be a problem?

18:48.128 --> 18:50.061
This is a great gift.
Thank you.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.063

one thing from you.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.297

18:53.399 --> 18:55.299

a Christmas gift to me.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.602
Okay.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.372
And I know this is a hard
concept for you, but just try.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.875
- Try to have fun.
- I am having fun!

19:03.977 --> 19:06.477
I'm serious. I love you,
but you are constantly working.

19:06.579 --> 19:11.249

You need to relax, escape.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.917
Escape.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.720
- You don't seem relaxed.
- I am relaxed! Stop!

Oh, maybe we're looking
in the wrong direction.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.025
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, yeah.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.043
Be right back.

20:18.234 --> 20:21.135
- Can I help you?
- You're the...

20:21.237 --> 20:24.872
Yes, you're the hotel
cruise manager, right?

20:24.974 --> 20:27.475
Well, I have a complaint
about my bed.

20:27.577 --> 20:30.711
- It's not comfortable enough?
- Not exactly.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.981
It's just that we were supposed
to have two beds,

20:34.083 --> 20:35.549
and there's only one.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.585
- You wanna handle this one?
- Yeah, sure.

20:37.687 --> 20:40.421
I have to bring some extra
towels to that family in 4B.

20:40.523 --> 20:42.256
Oh, okay.

20:42.358 --> 20:44.191
I got it covered, Boss.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.330
Wow.

Hey, hello again.

20:51.901 --> 20:53.634
Hello again.

20:53.736 --> 20:57.939
So, uh,
how can I help you?

20:58.041 --> 21:02.343
You wouldn't also secretly be
the captain or something?

21:02.445 --> 21:06.113
No, I wish I was the captain,
I really do, but no, I'm not.

21:06.215 --> 21:07.515
What's the problem?

21:07.617 --> 21:09.750
- It's our cabin.
- Stateroom.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.152
Huh?
It's not called a cabin.

21:11.254 --> 21:13.020
It's called a stateroom.

21:13.122 --> 21:15.623
Let me guess.
You don't like the decor.

21:15.725 --> 21:17.959
Oh, no,
I love the color scheme.

21:18.061 --> 21:19.794
Green's my favorite color.

21:19.896 --> 21:23.664
It's just that my stateroom
only has one bed.

21:23.766 --> 21:25.967
- Oh.
- You still call it a bed,

21:26.069 --> 21:27.880
or do you call them something
differently on the boat?

21:27.904 --> 21:29.370
The ship.

21:29.472 --> 21:32.173
You call the bed "the ship?"

21:32.275 --> 21:34.041
Doesn't have
something secretly

21:34.143 --> 21:37.611
to do with you thinking you're
a captain or something, does it?

21:37.714 --> 21:39.547
Heh heh.

21:39.649 --> 21:42.483
No. Listen, a bed
is still called "a bed,"

21:42.585 --> 21:45.319
and a boat is called
"the ship."

21:46.656 --> 21:48.823
Gotcha.

21:48.925 --> 21:50.458
I'll tell you what.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.727
Why don't I have somebody
bring up a rollaway bed

21:52.829 --> 21:54.829
to your stateroom
as soon as possible?

21:54.931 --> 21:56.697
- Is that okay?
- A rollaway?

21:56.799 --> 22:00.501
Can't you just move us to
a different room or something?

22:00.603 --> 22:03.571
Have you seen how many people
are on this boat?

22:03.673 --> 22:05.239
Maybe we could trade
with a couple.

22:05.341 --> 22:07.241
A couple?

22:07.343 --> 22:10.211
Yeah, someone with more beds
than they may need.

22:10.313 --> 22:13.247
I am so sorry, but we're doing
the best we can here.

22:13.349 --> 22:15.683
How about this? Why don't you
give your room number

22:15.785 --> 22:17.418
to the cruise hotel manager,

22:17.520 --> 22:21.655
and we will get you a rollaway
bed like we promised, huh?

22:21.758 --> 22:23.424
We're on a boat,

22:23.526 --> 22:26.060
and I'm going to sleep
on a rollaway.

22:26.162 --> 22:30.398
Well, it won't roll away
while I'm sleeping, will it?

22:32.135 --> 22:35.169

<i>♪ </i>

31:40.199 --> 31:43.267
Is that a jade angelfish?

31:43.335 --> 31:45.068
I study those, for real.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.236
Study?

31:46.338 --> 31:48.238
I'm a marine biologist.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.276
Do you have any idea how rare
and beautiful those fish are?

31:52.378 --> 31:53.944
So you like my necklace?

31:54.046 --> 31:55.245
It's perfect.

31:57.650 --> 31:58.815
Ohh...

31:58.918 --> 32:00.984
Oh, I need this drink
more than ever.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.286
Mm.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.590
Oh, that's so much better.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.926
Oh! Oh, my stomach.

32:11.497 --> 32:15.299
Aw, I used to be
on my feet all the time.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.234
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

32:17.336 --> 32:20.437
I was a professional
speed walker.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.407
We did a walking race all the
way from Miami to Los Angeles.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.320
Came in third place.
Had sponsorships and everything.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.077
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:27.179 --> 32:30.948
But then my calcium deficiency
caused my arches to collapse.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.849
I had to get
a dual hip replacement.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.619
One of them's
actually made of teak wood.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.288
Ended up getting wood worms
for a while,

32:38.390 --> 32:40.657
but some antibiotics
took care of that.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.259
- I'm fine now.
- Okay.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.605
You seem a little
uncomfortable yourself.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.463
You okay? Is it... Oh!

32:46.565 --> 32:48.799
- It's the heels, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's the heels.

32:48.901 --> 32:50.367
I know all about that.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.703
I had to wear heels
when I was a lingerie model

32:52.805 --> 32:54.438
in Paris for a while.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.007
Thank God.
Hey, I've got a call.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.843
- I need to take this.
- Oh, okay, sure.

32:59.912 --> 33:03.213
Just a minute, okay?
Excuse me. Watch those arches.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.782
Gonna sit down right here
on the floor for a second.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.956
Arlo?
What are you doing?

33:13.058 --> 33:16.827
It's gotta be like
3:00 in the morning there.

33:16.929 --> 33:20.330
<i>I went out tonight,
and I almost fell in love.</i>

33:20.399 --> 33:21.865
What happened?

33:21.967 --> 33:23.734
She threw a drink in my face,

33:23.836 --> 33:26.603
but then she didn't wanna
come home with me.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.005
I'm sorry.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.806
<i>I even told her about the boat.</i>

33:29.908 --> 33:31.174
You have a boat?

33:31.276 --> 33:32.743
<i>It's my father's boat, right?</i>

33:32.811 --> 33:34.578
And it's technically a yacht,

33:34.680 --> 33:37.214
so I guess I was lying about
the boat thing, I don't know.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.016
<i>- But speaking of boats.</i>
<i>- </i> Ship.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.550
- Huh?
- <i>Never mind.</i>

33:40.619 --> 33:42.019
What's going on, Arlo?

33:42.121 --> 33:44.254
<i>How's it going on the</i>
barco de amor?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.089
Well...

33:46.191 --> 33:48.071
<i>That's Spanish for
"boat of love," by the way.</i>

33:48.127 --> 33:49.607
This cruise storyline,
I'm telling ya,

33:49.661 --> 33:51.061
it's a winner,
it's a winner.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.363
But you just gotta
make my life easier.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.766
<i>Right now you're out there
on the high seas,</i>

33:55.868 --> 33:59.569
<i>and I'm sure it's just filled
with lots of beautiful women.</i>

33:59.671 --> 34:01.371
- Arlo?
<i>- And men.</i>

34:01.473 --> 34:03.740
I'm sure there's lots
of handsome men there.

34:03.842 --> 34:08.110
<i>See, you understand
at your age. You get it.</i>

34:08.213 --> 34:11.447
Meet some guy,
escape a little,

34:11.550 --> 34:13.417
<i>and find your story.</i>

34:13.518 --> 34:15.452
<i>And when you do,
you come home and get to work,</i>

34:15.554 --> 34:17.387
<i>and before you know it,</i>

34:17.489 --> 34:19.467
<i>you're gonna be spending
so much time thinking about</i>

34:19.491 --> 34:22.958
how you'll fill this huge
office with swanky furniture

34:23.062 --> 34:25.139
that you're not even gonna
realize that you're alone.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.929
<i>Right?</i>

34:27.032 --> 34:29.232
<i>I can't wait to see
what you come up with.</i>

34:29.333 --> 34:30.699
We'll talk soon, huh?

34:30.803 --> 34:33.603
All right.
Be safe, Arlo. Bye.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.774
Don't do it.

34:37.876 --> 34:40.043
Don't do what?

34:40.145 --> 34:41.645
Jump.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.649
What on earth makes you
think that I would jump?

34:45.751 --> 34:47.951
Ho ho ho, young lady,
you'd be surprised.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.418
Once every couple of years,

34:49.521 --> 34:51.199
a passenger gets
the bright idea of, you know,

34:51.223 --> 34:53.422
going over the railing.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.458
Then we gotta throw
a lifeboat in the water,

34:55.561 --> 34:58.261
and then somebody's gotta
fish 'em out of the water.

34:58.363 --> 35:01.364
It's a whole thing, you know?
It gets complicated.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.469
Why aren't you
in there dancing?

35:05.571 --> 35:08.939
Mm. I don't like to dance.

35:09.041 --> 35:12.008
I find that very difficult
to believe.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.811
Why aren't you
in there dancing?

35:17.182 --> 35:19.449
I'm off duty
for a few minutes,

35:19.551 --> 35:21.485
just taking a little break.

35:21.587 --> 35:24.621
One of my favorite things to do
is come out here

35:24.723 --> 35:27.190
and just be quiet.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.459
Peaceful.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.328
I mean, look out there.

35:31.430 --> 35:34.331
That open sea
laid out before us,

35:34.466 --> 35:35.699
it's beautiful.

35:36.869 --> 35:39.002
Makes you think.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.873
I know what you mean.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.175
Funny, when I first
came on the boat,

35:45.277 --> 35:49.446
I was scared that I was
gonna get seasick, but...

35:49.548 --> 35:51.681
this is nice.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.483
It's nice.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.153
Enjoying yourself so far?

35:57.723 --> 35:59.322
So far.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.325
Santa's little gift,
did you get that?

36:02.427 --> 36:04.628
Did you have something
to do with that?

36:04.730 --> 36:06.630
How did you know?

36:06.732 --> 36:09.232
Ah, that old notebook of yours
was getting full,

36:09.334 --> 36:10.867
as far as I could tell,

36:10.969 --> 36:13.670
and you did mention that
your favorite color is green.

36:13.772 --> 36:18.375
It's the details. You gotta
pay attention to little things.

36:21.013 --> 36:24.147
I heard that
there was a policy

36:24.249 --> 36:28.084
about the crew fraternizing
with passengers.

36:28.187 --> 36:30.754
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's a big policy.

36:30.856 --> 36:34.057
That's a big rule.
We don't do that.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.093
Hmm.

36:37.196 --> 36:41.198
Of course, technically...

36:41.300 --> 36:43.366
I'm off duty
for a few more minutes.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.171
And?

36:48.273 --> 36:51.408
Would you care to dance?

36:55.948 --> 36:58.181
Oh, there you are!

36:58.283 --> 37:00.183
Ah, I brought you a freshie.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.852
I myself am on number seven,

37:02.955 --> 37:05.255
which brings my pain level
down to an eight.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.758
Cheers.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.127
Oh, hey!

37:11.230 --> 37:12.230
It's Jordan.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.563
Jonas, Jasper.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.198
It's Jake.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.733
That's what I said.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.769
Were you able to find me
those corn scrapers?

37:19.871 --> 37:22.272
Otherwise I can just use a
cheese grater from the kitchen.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.641
I'll bring 'em by your room.
Don't you worry about it.

37:24.743 --> 37:25.942
I got you covered.

37:26.044 --> 37:29.246
Oh, thank God, thank God.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.649
Well, uh...

37:32.718 --> 37:34.117
I gotta go back to work.

37:36.321 --> 37:37.621

37:37.723 --> 37:39.522

- Isn't Paul great?
- He's really not my type.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.352
I'm sorry. I know you're not
feeling his friend.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.421
I feel like I got
Satan in my slippers

38:44.523 --> 38:45.722
with a thousand pitchforks.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.157
I gotta...
I need to sit down.

38:47.259 --> 38:48.892
Oh, I should've worn
my orthopedics.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.361
Never choose fashion
over comfort.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.565
What gave you that idea?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.233
We've been walking
around for hours.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.869
Maybe we should find somewhere
to stop and chill out.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.272
Yeah, and maybe with
an enormous ice-cold drink?

39:02.341 --> 39:03.707
- Eggnog!
- Eggnog?

39:03.809 --> 39:05.642
Are you serious?

39:05.744 --> 39:07.043
Suddenly I just got a craving.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.879
Where you going?

39:09.981 --> 39:11.781
I gotta get some reception.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.316
Need to check
on my fantasy team.

39:13.418 --> 39:14.484
We made the playoffs.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.619
- Fantasy team?
- He's obsessed

39:16.722 --> 39:18.054
with his
fantasy football team.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.156
It's not an obsession.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.926
Fantasy teams are important.
I need to get Wi-Fi.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.372
If you want to later,
come by my room,

39:24.396 --> 39:25.673
and I'll introduce you
to the team.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.497
Some of the top draft picks.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.567
And if you can't make it,
I'll meet you for drinks later.

39:30.669 --> 39:31.768
Sure about that?

39:31.870 --> 39:33.737
Positive!

39:33.839 --> 39:36.339
Watch out! Coming through!

39:36.441 --> 39:39.509
Jake! Oh, I mean, um...

39:39.578 --> 39:41.077
What are you doing here?

39:41.179 --> 39:43.313
I thought you'd be
back on the boat.

39:43.415 --> 39:46.249
- The ship.
- Ship, right.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.685
You know, I'm in charge
of passenger activities

39:48.787 --> 39:50.620
on and off the ship,

39:50.722 --> 39:52.322
and Old Trusty right here

39:52.424 --> 39:54.324
is official
resort transportation.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.092
There's a dance class
in 10 minutes.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.905
If you'd like to attend that,
I can have my partner,

39:57.929 --> 39:59.863
the elf over here,
to take you two,

39:59.965 --> 40:04.868
or you can take
a tour of the island with <i> moi.</i>

40:04.970 --> 40:06.202
Hmm.

40:06.304 --> 40:07.771
Dance class?
That sounds fun.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.606
I'm game.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.675
Elfie man, take my two people
over there to the Hale Club,

40:12.778 --> 40:14.544
help get 'em set up, okay?

40:14.646 --> 40:16.346
Are you sure you wanna...

40:16.448 --> 40:18.348
Oh, right.

40:18.450 --> 40:20.650
I'll meet up with you later.
Have fun.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.857
Well...

40:27.959 --> 40:29.859
looks like
it's just you and me.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.161
Sure does.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.729
You know,
I'm still on the clock,

40:32.831 --> 40:34.664
but I might be persuaded

40:34.766 --> 40:37.534
to give a nickel tour
of the grounds.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.736
Hey, that sounds fun.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.472
Show us the most beautiful
place on the island.

40:42.574 --> 40:43.773
Yep.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.576
Hang on, kids.

<i>♪</i>

40:56.922 --> 40:58.388
All right.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.023
We are here.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.758
Wow.

41:01.860 --> 41:05.094
Babe, how many times
have we been on this cruise,

41:05.197 --> 41:08.731
and we've never seen
a view like this?

41:08.834 --> 41:10.867
Stunning.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.502
Hey.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.736
Yeah.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.192
I thought we should give 'em
a little privacy, you know?

41:24.216 --> 41:27.083
- Very perceptive.
- Thank you.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.052
- Wow. Okay.
- Right?

41:29.154 --> 41:33.122
Gotta give it to you.
This is a great view.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.124
Yeah, it sure is.

41:36.328 --> 41:37.427
Yeah.

41:39.364 --> 41:45.201
Maybe we should just try and
enjoy this right here, huh?

41:45.303 --> 41:49.739
Oh, I was just trying
to take pictures for my...

41:49.841 --> 41:51.281
- Never mind.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.810
I know exactly
what you're doing.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.412
Beautiful, huh?

41:56.515 --> 41:58.214
Sometimes you just
gotta appreciate

41:58.316 --> 42:01.317
the little things in life.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.887
So this isn't
your first cruise ship.

42:03.989 --> 42:07.490
I mean, um, how long
have you been in travel?

42:07.592 --> 42:10.560
Me? Um, a long time.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.502
But, you know, I was
in construction for years,

42:12.531 --> 42:14.171
and I started off
in an accounting office.

42:14.266 --> 42:15.665
You were an accountant?

42:15.767 --> 42:17.800
You're damn right I was,
if you can believe that.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.936
My first job,
I was an accountant.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.171
I didn't last that long though.

42:22.274 --> 42:25.008
My marriage lasted
slightly longer.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.477
After my divorce,
I kicked around a couple things,

42:27.579 --> 42:30.446
and now here I am.

42:30.549 --> 42:32.115
Yeah.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.783
And what about you?

42:33.885 --> 42:36.085
What about me?

42:36.187 --> 42:37.620
How do you find yourself
on the edge

42:37.722 --> 42:41.291
of this beautiful cliff
in the South Pacific?

42:41.393 --> 42:43.271
What does your boyfriend think
about you taking off

42:43.295 --> 42:48.031
on a long excursion
like this sea cruise, huh?

42:48.133 --> 42:51.167
I don't have one
at the moment.

42:51.269 --> 42:52.635
Really?

42:52.737 --> 42:54.704
What, is it a law
that I have to have one?

42:54.806 --> 42:56.339
No, no, no, not at all.

42:56.441 --> 42:59.375
I'm just, uh,
I'm just a little surprised

42:59.477 --> 43:04.047
that such a beautiful,
talented,

43:04.149 --> 43:09.285
wonderful woman like yourself
is still single.

43:09.387 --> 43:10.720
Hmm.

43:10.822 --> 43:14.357
How many women have you
brought to this spot?

43:14.459 --> 43:17.493
Honestly? Um...

43:20.131 --> 43:21.397
One.

43:21.499 --> 43:22.499
Oh.

43:23.568 --> 43:24.834
Counting today.

43:24.936 --> 43:28.304
Right, right.

43:28.406 --> 43:31.174
What, right?
That surprises you?

43:31.276 --> 43:35.478
It's just, you seem like
the exact type of person

43:35.580 --> 43:38.081
that would do this type
of thing all the time.

43:38.183 --> 43:39.983
Really?
That's what I seem like?

43:40.085 --> 43:42.085
What kind of person is that?

43:42.187 --> 43:46.089
A ruggedly handsome
cruise director, huh?

43:46.191 --> 43:48.358
A ruggedly handsome
cruise director?

43:48.460 --> 43:50.293
You heard me.

43:56.501 --> 43:58.267
What are you doing?

44:00.605 --> 44:02.405
I'm not too sure.

44:04.175 --> 44:06.175
You know I'm telling the truth.

44:06.277 --> 44:09.078
I haven't brought anybody,
no one, up here,

44:09.180 --> 44:11.214
if that's what you're thinking.

44:11.316 --> 44:16.252
Oh, so now you know
what I'm thinking.

44:16.354 --> 44:17.453
I think I do.

44:17.555 --> 44:19.255
Help! Help!

44:19.357 --> 44:20.456
- Oh, thank God!
- Oh, no.

44:20.558 --> 44:23.793
Joe! I mean Jerry!
Is that you?

44:23.895 --> 44:25.928
- It's Jake!
- Oh, God!

44:26.031 --> 44:27.130
Hey.

44:27.232 --> 44:28.898
I was trying
to find reception,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.067
and this eagle
swooped out of nowhere,

44:31.136 --> 44:32.935
and it flew off with my phone.

44:33.038 --> 44:34.704
That's when I went after it.

44:34.806 --> 44:36.326
You know I can't run
'cause of my feet.

44:36.408 --> 44:38.808
- Sorry, guys.
- And then this badger came out.

44:38.910 --> 44:41.244
It attacked me,
but I fought it off my shoe.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.879
Did you say a badger?

44:42.981 --> 44:44.647
Come on, man,
let's get it together.

44:44.749 --> 44:46.749
You're a mess here.
Let's take all this stuff off.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.419
You're gonna be all right.
We'll get you some water.

44:49.521 --> 44:52.321
Come on. Let's get outta here.
Come on. Help in there.

44:52.424 --> 44:55.291
We got a ride for you.
I'll sit in the middle.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.427
Come on, come on, come on.

44:57.529 --> 44:59.495
I'll sit in the middle.
Come on.

44:59.597 --> 45:01.164
All right.
You got it, you got it.

45:01.266 --> 45:03.666
All right, all right, okay.

45:03.768 --> 45:06.302
- Oh, man, what the...
- What's the matter?

45:06.404 --> 45:09.238
The battery.
The battery needs to charge up.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.608
- Are we stuck here?
- No, we're not stuck here.

45:12.711 --> 45:15.111
We can just call someone
for a ride or something, right?

45:15.213 --> 45:17.914
We're not gonna get a signal
on this side of the island.

45:18.016 --> 45:20.583
Okay, um...

45:20.685 --> 45:22.118
We're gonna walk back
to the resort.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.753
It's only a 20-minute walk
from here.

45:23.855 --> 45:26.322
No, I can't!
I can't! My feet will fall off.

45:26.458 --> 45:28.124
Yeah, okay,
I figured you'd say that.

45:28.226 --> 45:31.127
So then we're gonna
follow this road

45:31.229 --> 45:34.330
through
Candy Cane Orchard, right?

45:34.432 --> 45:36.332
And then we'll get
a signal there.

45:36.434 --> 45:38.245
Someone will come and get us.
It's gonna be fine.

45:38.269 --> 45:40.103
Pam, you come with me.
You three stay here.

45:40.205 --> 45:41.704
Let's do this, okay?

45:41.806 --> 45:43.117
Are you sure
you guys are gonna be okay?

45:43.141 --> 45:44.640
Yeah, we're gonna be
just fine,

45:44.743 --> 45:48.010
I just gotta get my trusty
flashlight here to...

45:48.113 --> 45:49.712
With my...

45:49.814 --> 45:52.849
Darn it!

45:52.951 --> 45:55.518
We'll be back for you guys
as soon as we can. Come on.

45:55.620 --> 45:57.720
Oh, please hurry!
My feet! Please!

46:00.925 --> 46:04.627
So you're
just working 24/7.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.295
Yeah, but I have a plan.

46:06.397 --> 46:09.165
See, I have been a journalist
my entire adult life.

46:09.267 --> 46:11.601
I've worked my way up the ranks
at <i> New York Minute,</i>

46:11.703 --> 46:13.169
and it is about to pay off.

46:13.271 --> 46:14.337
And then what?

46:16.508 --> 46:18.674
What do you mean,
"And then what?"

46:18.777 --> 46:21.778
And then what are you gonna do
with the rest of your life, huh?

46:21.880 --> 46:24.280
having fun, relationships,

46:24.382 --> 46:27.116
enjoying what you worked for,
that kinda stuff.

46:27.218 --> 46:29.252
I love writing.

46:29.354 --> 46:31.154
You don't love working
at the <i> New York Minute.</i>

46:31.256 --> 46:33.122
Like I said, we're about
to make big changes,

46:33.224 --> 46:34.590
and I'm gonna be
a part of that.

46:34.692 --> 46:38.961
Okay, what about
working with this kid?

46:39.063 --> 46:40.696
Kid?

46:40.799 --> 46:43.766
Yeah, maybe it's not
what I want to be doing,

46:43.868 --> 46:46.102
but nothing in life
is perfect, right?

46:46.204 --> 46:49.105
Okay, so what do you wanna do?

46:49.207 --> 46:52.608
I mean, if you could
write anything,

46:52.710 --> 46:56.679
anything at all,
what would it be?

46:56.781 --> 46:58.781
My book.

46:58.883 --> 47:00.716
This might sound funny, but...

47:00.819 --> 47:02.459
I've just been writing
so much for the job

47:02.487 --> 47:03.886
that I don't have time
for my book.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.788
Hmm.

47:05.890 --> 47:07.557
I smell an excuse in the air.

47:07.659 --> 47:08.991
- Jake.
- What?

47:09.093 --> 47:12.528
Nobody is paying me
to write my memoirs.

47:12.630 --> 47:17.667
Anyways, you are the last person
to be lecturing somebody else

47:17.769 --> 47:19.569
about long-term goals.

47:19.671 --> 47:21.137
What is that
supposed to mean?

47:21.239 --> 47:24.507
It means
I don't think you have any.

47:25.910 --> 47:28.544
- Really?
- Really.

47:30.849 --> 47:33.182
Hey, now.

47:33.284 --> 47:34.917
You know what I do?

47:35.019 --> 47:37.687
I cast my fate to the wind.

47:37.789 --> 47:39.689
How can you live like that?

47:39.791 --> 47:41.424
There's no plan,
no discipline.

47:41.526 --> 47:43.025
That would drive me
up the wall.

47:43.127 --> 47:45.428
Oh, you? I bet it would.
But for me, it's easy.

47:45.530 --> 47:47.308
You know, instead of plotting
the next 10 years of my life,

47:47.332 --> 47:49.732
I get out,
and I live my life.

47:49.834 --> 47:52.702
Yeah, I get to travel,
I get to meet great people,

47:52.804 --> 47:56.706
I get to experience
incredible things.

47:56.808 --> 47:58.875
Do you even have a home?

48:00.845 --> 48:02.578
Yeah.

48:02.680 --> 48:06.048
We're headed to my home
right now.

48:07.552 --> 48:10.686
- Speaking of ship.
- What?

48:10.788 --> 48:13.956
Dang it.
Still no signal.

48:14.058 --> 48:17.426
You know what I think?
You want that promotion so bad

48:17.528 --> 48:20.429
that you're forgetting
what you even want it for.

48:20.531 --> 48:23.065
I don't even know
what that means.

48:23.167 --> 48:26.936
It means that you've got time
for everything.

48:27.038 --> 48:30.273
You work hard,
and you can still live life.

48:30.375 --> 48:31.941
You can be happy.

48:32.043 --> 48:36.379
- Who says I'm not happy?
- Well, are you happy?

48:36.481 --> 48:38.180
I don't know.

48:40.084 --> 48:45.421
Maybe you just need somebody
to remind you in your life.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.725
I guess you think
you're that somebody.

48:49.827 --> 48:51.794
Well, maybe I am.

48:52.864 --> 48:54.330
Maybe.

48:56.234 --> 48:59.936
There's only one way
to find out.

49:10.381 --> 49:12.348
- Ooh, ooh!
- What is that?

49:12.450 --> 49:14.583
- We got a signal, right?
- Yeah!

49:14.686 --> 49:16.319
Okay, this is
what we're gonna do.

49:16.387 --> 49:18.354
We're gonna get some help,
and this right here,

49:18.456 --> 49:21.357
right now, we gotta keep
this whole thing under wraps.

49:21.459 --> 49:23.426
Tomorrow evening,
it's gonna be busy,

49:23.528 --> 49:25.528
and so I'm gonna carve out
some time if I can.

49:25.630 --> 49:27.207
We're gonna get together.
Meet me then, right?

49:27.231 --> 49:28.597
- Sounds like a plan.
- Okay, good.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.300
- We got a signal.
- Let's go.

49:31.402 --> 49:34.403
<i>♪</i>

49:45.216 --> 49:49.051
So what happened
between you and Jake?

49:49.153 --> 49:50.820
Come on!
I've known you long enough

49:50.922 --> 49:52.366
to know when you're
keeping something from me.

49:52.390 --> 49:54.357
You do that whole
pouty lip thing.

49:54.459 --> 49:57.994
It's not pouty lip.
It's a medical condition.

49:58.096 --> 50:01.030
It's not a condition.
It's your kissing-Jake face.

50:03.167 --> 50:06.168
I knew it!
You and the cruise director!

50:06.270 --> 50:07.403
Scandalous!

50:07.505 --> 50:08.738
Keep it quiet. Keep it down.

50:08.806 --> 50:10.166
I don't want him
to get in trouble.

50:10.241 --> 50:11.340
So you admit it.

50:11.442 --> 50:13.876
Just keep it quiet, okay?

50:13.978 --> 50:15.745
You like him though.

50:16.848 --> 50:18.214
- Oh!
- Hey, ladies!

50:18.316 --> 50:20.216
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hey.

50:20.318 --> 50:22.918
God, I had such a blast with you
in that dance class.

50:23.021 --> 50:24.687
You got some moves,
you know that?

50:24.789 --> 50:26.722
You guys know about
the Christmas ball

50:26.824 --> 50:28.224
on the last night
of the cruise?

50:28.326 --> 50:29.759
That's gonna be so fun.

50:29.861 --> 50:33.262
But I don't think
Gil's gonna make it.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.675
I mean, his feet
are bothering him.

50:34.699 --> 50:36.232
He is a wreck.

50:36.334 --> 50:38.868
Mm. So sorry to hear that.

50:38.970 --> 50:41.348
I'm pretty sure she won't have
a problem finding another date.

50:41.372 --> 50:44.573
Yeah? Are you as good
a dancer as your friend here?

50:44.675 --> 50:48.044
I don't dance.
I'm a professional wallflower.

50:48.146 --> 50:50.513
You should try it.
You might like it.

50:50.615 --> 50:52.581
I'm good.

50:52.683 --> 50:54.216
- Bye.
- Bye.

51:16.140 --> 51:20.109
"There is a certain inescapable,
old-fashioned charm

51:20.211 --> 51:22.378
to Christmas Island.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.580
At every turn,
the streets are festoon

51:24.682 --> 51:26.715
with tinsel and candy canes.

51:26.818 --> 51:28.884
The smell of gingerbread
is in the air,

51:28.986 --> 51:30.820
and the people are..."

51:30.922 --> 51:33.322
Festoon.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.091
That doesn't sound right.

51:38.196 --> 51:39.962
Hello, it's Pam.

51:40.064 --> 51:41.163
<i>It's me.</i>

51:41.265 --> 51:44.066
Oh, hey, Arlo.
How's the city?

51:44.168 --> 51:45.801
Cold, damp, too many people.

51:45.903 --> 51:48.771
Oh, I went out to
meat packing last night,

51:48.873 --> 51:50.739
I went to this club.

51:50.842 --> 51:52.441
<i>It was like booming,
you know?</i>

51:52.543 --> 51:55.678
<i>Boom, boom, boom, boom!
All the way up to 87th Street.</i>

51:55.780 --> 51:58.814
<i>Anyway, there was this girl
that was out on the dance floor</i>

51:58.916 --> 52:01.250
that I had to go talk to
and ask her name,

52:01.352 --> 52:04.086
and you know
what she said to me?

52:04.188 --> 52:07.089
I have a feeling
this is not gonna go well.

52:07.191 --> 52:09.692
- <i>She said, "Amy."</i>
- And?

52:09.794 --> 52:12.428
Actually, I turned around,
and I walked away.

52:12.530 --> 52:13.963
<i>Why?</i>

52:14.065 --> 52:15.542
'Cause it was the name
of the first girl

52:15.566 --> 52:17.044
that I ever fell in love with
in first grade

52:17.068 --> 52:18.668
<i>and that girl,
she broke my heart, so...</i>

52:18.703 --> 52:21.303
Wait a second.
You're telling me

52:21.405 --> 52:24.140
just because the name
reminded you of a bad experience

52:24.242 --> 52:26.509
that you missed out on
the chance of having a good one?

52:26.611 --> 52:29.345
<i>When you put it that way,
you make it seem like I missed</i>

52:29.447 --> 52:31.113
a very good opportunity.

52:31.215 --> 52:32.982
So how's it going for you?

52:33.084 --> 52:35.351
- Uh...
- <i>Are you smiling?</i>

52:35.453 --> 52:38.053
<i>I can hear you smiling
over the phone right now.</i>

52:38.156 --> 52:39.822

52:39.891 --> 52:41.790
<i>I wasn't thinking about
writing about myself.</i>

52:41.893 --> 52:44.360
<i>My friend,
she met this hot guy.</i>

52:44.462 --> 52:46.295
Yeah? All right.

52:46.397 --> 52:48.631
Your friend.
I like where this is going.

52:48.733 --> 52:50.466
This is like
a double-trouble story.

52:50.568 --> 52:51.901
You should write
about that too.

52:52.003 --> 52:53.702
It's not exactly
what you think.

52:53.804 --> 52:55.616
<i>Yeah, I think I should've
gone on this cruise.</i>

52:55.640 --> 52:58.174
I think I'm missing out.
I'm gonna book it for next year.

52:58.276 --> 53:01.076
<i>Anyway, the whole thing
sounds great.</i>

53:01.179 --> 53:05.414
Just remember,
more steamy, more circulation.

53:05.516 --> 53:07.550
- Steamy?
<i>- Or sexy. Whatever.</i>

53:07.652 --> 53:09.018

stay on that boat forever.</i>

53:17.828 --> 53:19.662
Pam?

53:19.764 --> 53:21.497
- <i>Ship.</i>
- What?

53:21.599 --> 53:23.098
<i>It's called a ship.</i>

53:23.201 --> 53:26.602
<i>Oh, yeah.
No, you're absolutely right.</i>

53:26.704 --> 53:28.949
All right, well, hey, I can't
wait to see this final piece.

53:28.973 --> 53:30.739
It sounds like you got
plenty of material,

53:30.841 --> 53:34.510
so just remember one thing
for me, Pam: sexy.

53:34.612 --> 53:36.679
You got it, Arlo, sexy.

53:36.781 --> 53:37.781
Bye.

the ship to Christmas Island,

53:46.557 --> 53:49.525

Christmas Island,

54:43.581 --> 54:47.349

54:47.451 --> 54:49.184
And though it was forbidden,

54:49.287 --> 54:51.754
we couldn't resist it
any longer.

54:51.856 --> 54:55.357
Our bodies pressed against
each other for just a moment,

54:55.459 --> 55:01.196
our hearts throbbing

What are you afraid of?

When I met David,
when I saw him there,

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.661
standing with that plate
of all-you-can-eat...

01:00:15.763 --> 01:00:17.763
- Shrimp?
- You know what?

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:19.498
It was actually crab legs.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600
Okay.

01:00:20.634 --> 01:00:22.367
Anyway...

01:00:22.469 --> 01:00:25.304
I just knew.

01:00:25.406 --> 01:00:29.274
And he made me laugh,
and he made me...

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.310
everything.

01:00:31.412 --> 01:00:34.479
And every day after that,
it just got better and better.

01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:38.517
And I'd be lying if I said
that every day was amazing,

01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:42.454
but he was always there for me.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:47.693
I'm having a hard time
detecting what the problem is.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.697
What if we fizzle out?

01:00:51.799 --> 01:00:53.865
I mean, what happened
to you and your ex?

01:00:53.968 --> 01:00:55.367
- We fizzled out.
- See?

01:00:55.469 --> 01:00:58.470
It was a different situation.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.505

01:01:00.607 --> 01:01:01.607

01:01:01.642 --> 01:01:02.975
Are you bragging?

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:06.678
No, no. It's just...

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.482
I haven't done anything yet,

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:13.051
and I'm about to settle down.

01:01:13.153 --> 01:01:15.053
And I see you and your friend,

01:01:15.155 --> 01:01:18.190
and you guys are beautiful,
smart, sophisticated,

01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:19.925
talented women.

01:01:20.027 --> 01:01:23.061
You guys seem perfectly happy.

01:01:23.163 --> 01:01:27.399
I mean, do you even have
a desire to get married again?

01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:30.702
I haven't even thought about it
again until this cruise.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:38.010
Look, I don't know
how things will end, but...

01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:40.579
if something so big
starts with a spark,

01:01:40.681 --> 01:01:43.915
anything can happen, right?

01:01:44.018 --> 01:01:46.284
I mean, it could explode
or blow up in your face,

01:01:46.387 --> 01:01:50.889
or it could catch fire
and warm your heart forever.

01:01:54.661 --> 01:01:56.695
Sweetie, don't let the jitters

01:01:56.797 --> 01:02:00.966
stop you from
taking that chance, okay?

01:02:03.704 --> 01:02:06.405
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.476
- You know what?
- What?

01:02:11.578 --> 01:02:14.479
I'm gonna go find David,
and I'm gonna warm him up.

01:02:14.581 --> 01:02:16.581

01:02:18.552 --> 01:02:19.951

sneaking up on me like that.

01:02:31.265 --> 01:02:32.675

I'm a little disappointed

01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:34.232
that I didn't get
to hear you sing.

disappointed

01:02:37.371 --> 01:02:40.539
that you didn't get to see me
make a fool out of myself?

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.609
You know, I read
a few of your articles,

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.322
and I was listening
to what you said to her,

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.346
and I've gotta tell ya...

01:02:47.381 --> 01:02:49.614
You were listening?

01:02:49.716 --> 01:02:52.851
Yeah, I caught the tail end.

01:02:52.953 --> 01:02:57.422
Pam, you have got such a big,
beautiful heart in there.

01:02:57.524 --> 01:03:01.426
Why are you so afraid
to show it off?

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.961
I'm not afraid.

01:03:03.063 --> 01:03:06.598
Then why are you shaking?

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.200
I am not shaking.

01:03:08.302 --> 01:03:11.169
You are absolutely trembling.

01:03:11.271 --> 01:03:14.005
It's... It's cold out here.

01:03:14.108 --> 01:03:15.974
If it's so cold, come here.
I'll warm you up.

01:03:16.076 --> 01:03:20.545
May I remind you
that you are still on duty?

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:24.382

I just got finished reading,

01:03:52.763 --> 01:03:54.462
"Finding Love
on a Christmas Cruise."

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:56.298
Oh.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.767
Oh? You've been writing
this whole time.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:01.403
- It hasn't been a vacation.
- I can explain.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.786
Explain what? I thought you
wanted to spend time together.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.607
- I do!
- And have fun for a change.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:08.343
- I did!
- The only reason you came

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.889
was to write this article
for <i> New York Minute.</i>

01:04:09.913 --> 01:04:11.413
I feel used.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.059
Arlo told me that
if I wrote that article

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.416
for the Christmas edition,

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:16.518
that I would be promoted
to managing editor.

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.253
That's the only reason
why I did it.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.422
How was that supposed
to make me feel any better?

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:23.658
Well, because I've had a blast
on this cruise.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.861
Last night for me was...

01:04:25.963 --> 01:04:27.028
Where were you anyway?

01:04:29.266 --> 01:04:31.099
What, Jake?

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.134
What? But that's amazing!

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.437
I thought you were just
embellishing for the story.

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.439
At first I was, but...

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.774
that man is amazing.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:42.210
Oh, my, you really...

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:43.523
I'm gonna invite him
to my parents' house

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.779
for Christmas dinner.

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.781
- Whoa, that's serious.
- Yeah.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.350
I'm kinda nervous.

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:49.551
Oh, don't be nervous.

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:52.187
Becky, I am so sorry.

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:54.489
I should've told you.

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:57.325
But believe me,
this is the best time

01:04:57.427 --> 01:05:00.562
that I have had
in a long, long time.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:03.298
I feel like I'm 18 again.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.567
Oh, that reminds me.
I gonna meet up with Paul.

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:06.735
Oh, whoa, hey.

01:05:06.837 --> 01:05:08.470
Yeah?

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.672
Thank you.

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:13.742

I wonder what would be
the perfect ending?

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:14.369
I can think

Never get any taller than that.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.422
Every year on
the last night of the cruise,

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.669
passengers, they come here,
and you see all these presents?

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:12.660
They leave them
all around the tree.

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:15.697
They get collected up
and passed around

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:18.199
to needy kids in Los Angeles.

01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:23.338
It puts things in perspective,
doesn't it?

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.474
I guess we forgot
to bring a gift, huh?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.276
Oh, no. Come on, no.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.879
Don't worry about that.
It's okay.

01:07:30.981 --> 01:07:36.351
You know, when the
Christmas cruise first started,

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:40.121
it was to celebrate
the one time of year

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:44.125
where people set aside
their differences

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:47.662
and put up these little
shiny lights,

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:50.832
this beautiful
little miracle tree

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:54.169

that's right in the world.

01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:58.373
It still is.

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:04.813

about all that though, huh?

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.681

every year I go home
for Christmas dinner

and since the divorce,

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:45.406
my mother always asks me,
"Are you bringing someone?"

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:50.678
And when my mother asks,
"Are you bringing someone?"

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.513
she means...

01:10:56.319 --> 01:10:58.987

01:10:59.089 --> 01:11:01.256

thinks I'm kidding
when I tell her no.

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:08.529
She thinks I'm going
to surprise her,

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:11.432
so she's doubly disappointed
when I arrive by myself.

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:13.701
Wow.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.903
That's a whole lotta pressure
right there.

So I was wondering,
if you weren't doing anything,

01:11:24.014 --> 01:11:26.114
- would...
- Would I like...

01:11:26.216 --> 01:11:28.416
to go home with you
this Christmas

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:30.818

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.054
Yes.

01:11:33.156 --> 01:11:34.889
I would love to do that.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:37.525
I would love
to meet your mother.

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:38.926
But the truth is,

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:40.862
I have two more cruises
after this one,

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.864
and I'm gonna be
on the high seas

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.532
until early January.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.734
I-I...

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.904
Hey, Pam, no,
look at me, look.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:52.106
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

You know how serious
I take my job, right?

01:11:55.245 --> 01:11:57.812
And you of all people
must understand that...

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:01.115
No, no, it's okay,
I understand.

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:03.418
I understand.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.587
It's just that
this change of pace

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.257
has been really good
for me, and...

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:12.260
I thought maybe
switching things up...

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:14.862
might be good for you too.

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.069
I'm gonna go get
some fresh air.

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:23.037
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:26.874
Sure.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:40.988
You're upset.

01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:44.959
Why would I be upset?

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:50.365
Pam.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:52.467
You're an amazing woman,
you know that?

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.604
But you're breaking up with me.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:13:00.341
No, no, of course not.
No, I don't want you to go.

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:02.377
- You mean stay here?
- Yes.

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:06.114
So you want me
to quit my dream job,

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:08.216
move out of my nice apartment
in New York,

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:10.518
and follow you around
on the high seas.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.621
Hold on. You said the change
has been good for you.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.290
Yes, on vacation.

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:20.828
You can't live
your entire life on vacation.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.531
I thought your dream job
was being a novelist?

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:26.501
I live in the real world, Jake.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:28.503
This is not the real world.

01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:30.972
This is some type
of fantasy land

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:34.642
where you can make it Christmas
whenever you want.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:39.013
Meanwhile, I have
to pay bills, taxes.

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:40.848
I've gotta find out
where I'm gonna live

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.683
and whether or not my boss
is gonna fire me

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:46.087
because I don't finish
my article edited on time.

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.256
You're not happy.

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:52.493
How many people do you know
that end up happy?

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.562
I don't know.
I'm looking around this ship

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:57.398
and it seems like
a lot of people are happy.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.536
Have you talked to everyone
on this boat?

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:03.504
Oh, I forgot!

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.440
You're the cruise director.

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:09.010
Well, most people are gonna
have to go home too, Jake.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.812
But you don't.

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.021
Jake, you can come
and stay in New York,

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:23.057
have a great Christmas
there too.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:26.194
I mean, we don't have
palm trees and waves,

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:29.964
but there's Christmas lights
on Fifth Avenue.

01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:34.635
And the Rockettes
and ice skating.

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:36.737
I know.
I know all about this, Pam.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.374
I know there's a big blowout
on New Year's Eve as well.

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:42.109
I know.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:45.413
Pam.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.183
This is my life.

01:14:51.421 --> 01:14:54.755
I want you to be
part of my life.

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:57.458
My life is not
on a ship, Jake.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.461
And your life isn't working
for that paper either.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:06.567
All the articles that I've read
that you've written...

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.769
Your friend Becky,

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:12.139
Jessica, the girl
who's scared to get married,

01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:14.442
me...

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:19.013
You've offered all of us
great advice.

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:22.049
Now let me offer you some.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:26.754
Take a chance.
You hear me?

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:29.724
Take a chance
and bet on yourself.

01:15:31.261 --> 01:15:32.793
And you gotta focus
on your writing.

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:35.296
You gotta get that book
together.

01:15:35.398 --> 01:15:38.032
'Cause you know something?
I believe in you.

01:15:38.134 --> 01:15:39.634
And other people, they...

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:41.636
Pam, they believe in you.

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:44.939
Now it's just a matter of...

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.909
you believing in you.

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:57.151
So where does that leave us?

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:03.057
With a lot
of Christmas memories.

01:16:42.882 --> 01:16:44.815
"Christmas Cruise."

Merry Christmas.

01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:31.048
How was your Christmas cruise?

01:19:31.150 --> 01:19:32.550
Life changing.

01:19:32.652 --> 01:19:35.052
Ooh, that calls

01:19:35.154 --> 01:19:36.754
Of course.

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:38.956
- Oh!
- You want a snowman cupcake?

01:19:39.058 --> 01:19:41.625
I spent three days baking
a huge batch for the party.

01:19:41.727 --> 01:19:43.160
It's my specialty.

01:19:43.262 --> 01:19:45.563
Actually, those look
pretty great.

01:19:45.665 --> 01:19:50.100
But it looks like you outdid
yourself this time, kiddo.

01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:51.469
Nailed it!

01:19:51.571 --> 01:19:53.971
- Oh, hey!
- Hey, hey.

01:19:54.073 --> 01:19:55.840
- This is Amy.
- Amy!

01:19:55.942 --> 01:19:58.309
I've heard so much about you.
Nice to meet you.

01:19:58.411 --> 01:20:00.611
It's so nice to meet you too.
Happy Hanukkah.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.179
Same to you.

01:20:02.281 --> 01:20:05.149
And this is the new
managing editor

01:20:05.251 --> 01:20:07.284
of the <i> New York Minute.</i>

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.687
- What?
- Yes, yes. I read the article!

01:20:09.789 --> 01:20:11.255
Are you kidding me?
It was fantastic!

01:20:11.357 --> 01:20:12.823
I loved it, I loved it.

01:20:12.925 --> 01:20:16.861
So I suggest to you
that you start interviewing

01:20:16.963 --> 01:20:19.363
the most handsome personal
assistants you can find.

01:20:19.465 --> 01:20:22.366
Actually, I was thinking...

01:20:22.468 --> 01:20:25.336
I love when you're thinking.
She is such a great thinker.

01:20:25.438 --> 01:20:28.873
I think I'm gonna need
some time off.

01:20:28.975 --> 01:20:32.176
Yeah, great! You earned it.
When do you wanna come back?

01:20:32.245 --> 01:20:35.079
I'm not coming back.

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:39.761
You're going after the guy
on the boat, aren't ya?

01:20:39.785 --> 01:20:42.453
- The ship.
- Huh?

01:20:42.555 --> 01:20:45.623
I'm not going after anyone.

01:20:45.725 --> 01:20:49.627
I'm an intelligent, talented,
sophisticated woman.

01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:52.463
If any man wants to be with me,

01:20:52.565 --> 01:20:55.165
then he's gonna have
to come and get me.

01:20:55.268 --> 01:20:58.969
And I am finally
gonna write my book.

01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:01.238
Yeah, I'm gonna stop
talking about it,

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.841
and I'm gonna be about it.

01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:05.576
That's what I wanna do.

01:21:05.678 --> 01:21:07.144
Attention, workers.

01:21:07.246 --> 01:21:11.048
It is time
for Christmas karaoke!

01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:19.156
Now, since I'm obviously
the headliner,

01:21:19.258 --> 01:21:22.526
do I have any volunteers
for an opening act?

01:21:24.931 --> 01:21:27.197
Pam. Really?

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.966

Whatcha got?

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:34.705
I got a lot.
What are you in the mood for?

01:21:34.774 --> 01:21:36.941

01:22:07.373 --> 01:22:09.673
Jake, what are you doing here?

01:22:12.144 --> 01:22:15.145
I thought you needed saving.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:22.252
Oh, Jake, the time
that we spent was amazing.

01:22:22.355 --> 01:22:26.590
I'm so grateful that I met you,
and the fun that we had, but...

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:29.159
I can't live on a ship.

01:22:29.261 --> 01:22:33.063
I could visit
occasionally, but...

01:22:33.165 --> 01:22:37.768
there's a whole world out there
that I wanna see, and...

01:22:37.837 --> 01:22:39.770
I wanna be my own captain.

01:22:42.241 --> 01:22:45.976
And I wanna be your first mate.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.113
Really?

01:22:49.215 --> 01:22:53.917
After you left,
I spent a few days at sea.

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.554
I've never felt more alone
in my life.

01:22:58.924 --> 01:23:01.258
It just wasn't the same.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.294
And if you're not
gonna be there with me,

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:07.331
I don't wanna be
out on the sea.

01:23:23.949 --> 01:23:27.484
Okay, now I think there's
just a few more special people

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:29.853
