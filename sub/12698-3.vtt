WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:06.040
Okay, never have I ever
gone skydiving.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.010
Never have I ever
gone skydiving naked.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.448
- With triplets.
- All right.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.983
(Freddie laughing)

00:16.084 --> 00:19.487
Look, I dated adventurous,
body-positive triplets.

00:19.587 --> 00:20.988
And if you
wanna get me sloppy,

00:21.089 --> 00:22.656
stay on the triplet thing.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.192
We just know you're still bummed

00:24.292 --> 00:25.459
about breaking up
with Double Dutch,

00:25.559 --> 00:26.827
and playing Never Have I Ever

00:26.927 --> 00:29.263
is a surefire way
to get you drunk.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.731
I'll go again.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.933
Never have I ever
completely screwed up

00:33.033 --> 00:36.704
my friend's app launch party
in a mind-bogglingly stupid way

00:36.804 --> 00:39.540
- by making it a funeral.
- (laughing)

00:40.741 --> 00:42.443
Now me.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.414
Never have I ever
been divorced twice.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.717
Before I turned 30.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.453
Why'd you drink?

00:52.553 --> 00:55.889
Oh, I just wanted to remind
everyone that I'm not 30 yet.

00:55.989 --> 00:59.260
I don't want to play anymore.
This game's boring.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.795
Oh, let's play that game
where everybody

01:01.895 --> 01:04.198
just takes sips
whenever they want.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.234
Commonly known as drinking.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.602
Yeah, you don't like
playing this game

01:08.702 --> 01:11.305
because you've never
done anything.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.241
I've done stuff.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.642
ALL: Mm.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.644
Why doesn't anyone say,
"never have I ever

01:16.744 --> 01:19.247
gotten a really messed-up perm"
or "never have I ever

01:19.347 --> 01:22.450
just assumed the show
was called Downtown Abbey"?

01:23.283 --> 01:25.819
We don't say those things
because they're boring.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.357
Well, I guess I'm just
the boring one in the group.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.259
- What?
- That's crazy!

01:32.360 --> 01:34.295
- Have you met Freddie?
- Hey.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.297
Oh, my God,
you do think I'm boring.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.731
You're not boring.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.134
Responsible?
Yes.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.303
Stable?
For sure.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.738
Sensible?
The sensiblest.

01:44.838 --> 01:49.509
Well, would a sensible person
do this?

01:54.247 --> 01:55.716
What is this?

01:55.816 --> 01:58.519
Well, you never drink anyway,
so I just mixed up

01:58.619 --> 02:01.054
all the expired condiments
from my fridge.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.491
And a little tequila.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.826
- Ooh, let me get a taste.
- Oh, no.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.396
* I know you see *

02:09.497 --> 02:11.965
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

02:12.065 --> 02:15.569
* And be so wonderful *

02:15.669 --> 02:19.573
* So wake up the members
of my nation *

02:19.673 --> 02:21.242
* It's your time to be *

02:21.341 --> 02:24.077
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

02:24.178 --> 02:26.847
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

02:26.947 --> 02:30.050
* Of every situation *

02:30.150 --> 02:32.085
* Some things
are meant to be *

02:32.186 --> 02:35.923
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me **

02:40.428 --> 02:42.162
Wild and crazy thought.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.898
What if we went out tonight?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.268
Carly, you don't have
to do that.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.204
You're allowed to be
a sweet little yarn queen.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.872
But I'm not.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.041
Look.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.743
Ooh.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.811
Carly, I don't think
you're boring.

02:57.911 --> 03:01.582
I think you're pre-exciting.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.017
Plus, every friend group
needs a Carly.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.687
'Cause after a Harper
goes out and gets turnt,

03:06.787 --> 03:09.557
she needs a Carly to Postmate
her hungover ass

03:09.657 --> 03:11.559
eggs Benny the next morning.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.728
Well, what if, just this once,

03:15.829 --> 03:18.466
you take me out
and we both get turned?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.768
Carly, I just wanna stay home

03:20.868 --> 03:22.970
and wallow
in my post-breakup sadness,

03:23.070 --> 03:25.105
and watch that new
Kacey Musgraves special.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.541
That's a surreal,
post-divorce fever dream.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.977
It's basically white Lemonade.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.581
Okay.
I guess we'll stay in.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.752
I'm just playing.
We're going out!

03:38.852 --> 03:41.989
Oh, my God!
That was so exciting!

03:42.089 --> 03:44.892
- I'm gonna rip my robe off,
too.
- Oh, yes!

03:47.461 --> 03:49.597
Are those unicorn pajamas?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.065
Did you see he's dabbing?

03:52.165 --> 03:54.034
Nah.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.808
(laughing)

04:00.908 --> 04:03.711
You ready to see
the new Kevin office space?

04:03.811 --> 04:07.214
Be prepared.
It looks worse than it smells.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.054
- This is the Groovy Smoothie.
- It sure is!

04:14.154 --> 04:15.623
Why are we here?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.291
And why'd you have
to drive me around town

04:17.391 --> 04:18.625
for two hours blindfolded?

04:18.726 --> 04:19.726
This place is right around
the corner.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.194
I had to run some errands.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.664
I like to pay
all my utility bills in person.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.835
I bought the Groovy Smoothie
to make it up to you

04:27.935 --> 04:29.903
for screwing up
your Kevin app launch party.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.905
(scoffs)
Why would you think

04:32.005 --> 04:33.674
that an old, dilapidated
smoothie place...

04:33.774 --> 04:35.142
An old, dilapidated
smoothie place

04:35.242 --> 04:37.945
that's been closed
due to an oversized rat problem.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.714
...would make good office space?

04:40.814 --> 04:43.551
Because this place is iconic.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.086
Plus, not only
do we get an office,

04:46.186 --> 04:49.156
we get to run a restaurant,
which is so fun.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.858
You get your own booth.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.026
You get to enter
through the kitchen.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.429
You get to send
a bottle of wine

04:55.529 --> 04:58.098
to another table
and just nod.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.168
You can do that without
opening up your own restaurant.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.836
You can?

05:02.936 --> 05:05.305
Damn it, that's a very
expensive lesson.

05:05.406 --> 05:10.378
But look, all big tech start-ups
have unique work spaces.

05:10.478 --> 05:14.147
Etsy's commissary is just
a birdhouse made of hot glue.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.885
You know what? Yeah.
Yeah, maybe this could work.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.653
I could set up a little
office space right over there.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.622
Oh, that's where
the koi pond is gonna go.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.257
Obviously. Uh...

05:24.358 --> 05:25.793
Well, maybe I could take over
the second floor

05:25.893 --> 05:27.395
and make that Kevin HQ?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.830
Actually, I was gonna open
a dialysis center up there.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.132
Did you know anyone
can start one of those?

05:32.232 --> 05:33.734
Huh.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.270
I'm gonna set up a video call
with an animal shelter in Japan.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.407
I'm trying to get 'em to donate
a bunch of puppies to Kevin.

05:39.507 --> 05:42.209
- Millicent's here to translate.
- You speak Japanese?

05:42.308 --> 05:44.612
(speaking Japanese)

05:50.150 --> 05:52.319
I didn't understand
any of that.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.254
Do you speak Japanese or not?

05:59.493 --> 06:02.029
Yum!
These drinks are so good.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.598
I can't even taste
the alcohol in them.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.233
They're dangerous.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.335
(chuckles)

06:08.436 --> 06:11.905
So, what's the wild and crazy
itinerary for tonight?

06:12.005 --> 06:15.643
Ooh, first up, don't use words
like "itinerary."

06:16.276 --> 06:18.512
We're just gonna see where
the night takes us, cool?

06:18.612 --> 06:22.015
Totally, I don't need every
single little thing scheduled.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.185
- Yes.
- No plan, no problem.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.521
Okay, Carly, look,
if you don't wanna do this--

06:27.621 --> 06:29.156
Oh, no, I want to do this.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.692
I've never wanted
anything more.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.761
Except maybe an itinerary
for tonight.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.597
I'll drop it eventually.
Come on, let's go!

06:36.697 --> 06:39.032
(exclaiming, laughing)

06:39.132 --> 06:41.001
Mm! Mm.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.573
Ooh, are those
for car sickness?

06:45.673 --> 06:46.774
I would love
to get in on that.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.676
Oh, this is ACD.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.244
- It's a new organic club drug.
- How's it make you feel?

06:51.344 --> 06:53.714
Like you just jumped
out of a plane booty-naked,

06:53.814 --> 06:56.049
and as we've established,
I would know.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.487
- Give me one!
- Oh, girl, please,
you are not ready for this.

06:59.587 --> 07:03.991
Oh, come on, I want the full
Harper-night-out experience.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.259
Drinks, drugs,
triplets, car sickness.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.561
I can handle it.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.797
Okay!
(laughing)

07:09.897 --> 07:11.298
Cheers!

07:11.398 --> 07:13.667
Oh, do you have a pill-cutter?
It's a little big.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.036
Swallow it whole
or give it back.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.705
Cheers.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.875
Mm!

07:21.975 --> 07:23.343
I think I feel it already!

07:23.443 --> 07:27.014
No, you don't.
But I love the enthusiasm.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.189
* *

07:36.289 --> 07:37.457
Oh, my God.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.292
I gave the bartender
a fake number

07:39.392 --> 07:41.128
and got these drinks for free.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.996
- Ooh!
- (phone ringing)

07:43.096 --> 07:45.165
(gasps)
It's him.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.200
I guess I gave him
the right number.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.468
I am wasted.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.437
- Yeah!
- (both laughing)

07:50.538 --> 07:52.573
I'm proud of how crazy
you're being.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.775
But I wanna get even crazier,

07:54.875 --> 07:57.310
Okay, tell me what to do.
What do you do?

07:57.409 --> 07:58.779
Okay, well, you can't do
what I do

07:58.879 --> 08:00.280
because you have underwear on.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.415
But, for somebody
at your level,

08:02.516 --> 08:05.018
you could kiss a stranger.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.654
How 'bout...

08:06.754 --> 08:09.056
- Him!
- Okay.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.225
Can I kiss you?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.761
Absolutely.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.395
Okay.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.568
Thank you.
Thank you.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.503
- Did you see that?
- Mm-hmm.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.339
Okay, what crazy thing
can I do next?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.609
You could get into a bar fight.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.544
Can it be
with the same guy?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.445
I feel very comfortable
with him.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.816
Can I fight you?

08:35.915 --> 08:38.351
- No.
- What if he says no?

08:38.451 --> 08:40.821
- Throw a drink in his face.
- Okay.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.355
- Can I throw a drink
in your face?
- Just do it!

08:42.455 --> 08:43.657
Okay!

08:43.756 --> 08:44.992
Ah!

08:46.426 --> 08:48.361
Thank you.
Thank you.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.466
Okay, whatever this feeling is,
I gotta get more of it.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.802
I have to keep it going.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.704
I'm gonna steal
the bar garnish tray.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.708
Whoo!

09:02.576 --> 09:05.212
You can keep the olives.
Yuck.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.214
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

09:07.314 --> 09:09.382
So, thank you
for considering donating dogs

09:09.482 --> 09:10.483
for my app, Yusaku.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.420
(speaking Japanese)

09:18.125 --> 09:21.561
Ah, you ready
for another surprise?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.063
Spencer, I'm in a meeting.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.564
Yeah, surprises don't care
about meetings, buddy.

09:24.665 --> 09:28.636
- No, no, dude!
- One, two, sticks!

09:29.970 --> 09:32.472
Look what I found.
T-Bo's old food sticks.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.575
I think that's just
a large nest.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.144
Spencer, what about
all the office supplies

09:37.244 --> 09:38.578
I told you to get?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.013
It's the digital age, my dude.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.582
No one uses pens
or pads or paper anymore.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.118
Now, sticks,
on the other hand...

09:46.319 --> 09:48.521
Spencer, I don't know
about this whole

09:48.622 --> 09:51.058
office-combination-restaurant
thing.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.693
I gotta get Yusaku back.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.427
He probably thinks I hung up
on him, or that I was kidnapped.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.463
(laughing)
You're so cute.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.131
I'd totally kidnap you.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.737
Millicent, you're a child.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.138
You believe in magical things.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.574
You think finding
these sticks is a sign

10:07.675 --> 10:10.043
to restore the Groovy Smoothie
to its old glory?

10:10.143 --> 10:11.378
I think it's a sign

10:11.478 --> 10:13.413
we should check the freezers
for squatters.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.982
I already did.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.150
All I found were moldy
Otter Pops and a severed hand.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.286
Which reminds me,
I gotta call the cops.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.723
If it were me, I wouldn't just
redo what this place was.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.858
I would make it
what I want it to be.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.262
So, like, instead of food
on sticks,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.999
we could do-- wait for it--

10:32.099 --> 10:33.266
food on food?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.368
That could be fun.
We could use jicama.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.105
That's what I'm talking about,
jicama is perfect.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.707
What is jicama?

10:39.807 --> 10:41.809
Spencer, would you keep it down?

10:41.909 --> 10:43.543
Yusaku's trying
to tell me something.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.012
Millicent?

10:45.112 --> 10:47.748
(speaking Japanese)

10:48.882 --> 10:50.818
- What did he say?
- He said jicama

10:50.918 --> 10:52.552
is a light
and refreshing vegetable

10:52.652 --> 10:54.755
you sometimes see in salads.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.024
Oh.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.161
(both cheering)

11:01.261 --> 11:03.764
Woo-hoo!
Nailed it!

11:03.864 --> 11:05.165
You mind if I leave now?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.000
There's only one more bus
I can catch to get home.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.102
Oh. Yeah.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.605
Man, you are
showing me up tonight,

11:12.706 --> 11:14.041
getting all buck wild.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.476
You're not getting turned,
you getting turnt!

11:16.576 --> 11:19.947
Oh, it has a hard "T".
"Turnt."

11:20.047 --> 11:22.783
- Mm.
- It has a bite to it.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.418
Look, you kissed,
you fought,

11:25.518 --> 11:27.254
you threw a drink
in a guy's face,

11:27.354 --> 11:28.956
plus you stole drink garnishes

11:29.056 --> 11:31.825
and you won $42
in an illegal craps game.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.593
- Those guys were nice.
- Mm-hmm.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.362
I really liked
the guy who got stabbed.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.630
We should've helped him.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.035
Hey.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.371
Let's get inked.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.939
I don't know.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.342
Tattoos are very forever,
and I think you'll regret it.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.779
Let's do something else.
We could go back to the bar

11:51.879 --> 11:55.215
and steal those coasters
that say "You had me at Merlot."

11:55.315 --> 11:57.384
I want to get a tattoo.

11:57.484 --> 12:01.188
Plus, being wild and crazy
means having no regrets.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.589
You know who has regrets?

12:02.689 --> 12:04.491
People who marry
their high school sweethearts?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.293
Boring people.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.928
Come on, let's do it.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.964
All right,
let's keep it crazy!

12:11.064 --> 12:12.766
- Okay.
- (both laughing)

12:12.866 --> 12:14.201
Do you know
what you're gonna get?

12:14.301 --> 12:15.535
Oh, no brainer.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.805
A cute little bunny
on my right ankle.

12:17.905 --> 12:21.909
I meant, a cute little bunny
holding a knife,

12:22.009 --> 12:25.745
and a gun, and another gun,
on my right ankle.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.281
Left ankle?

12:28.381 --> 12:29.616
Both ankles?

12:29.716 --> 12:31.684
More guns.
Got it.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.156
Millicent, hey, wake up.
I need your help.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.993
Dude speaks English.
He knew "jicama."

12:40.994 --> 12:44.131
Ha-ha! Yes!
(whooping)

12:44.231 --> 12:45.933
Don't look now!

12:46.033 --> 12:47.367
I'm just kidding,
you should look.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.969
Look right at me.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.670
Oh my God, dude,
what are you doing?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.073
Well, I wasn't really feeling
the whole food-on-food thing,

12:53.173 --> 12:56.543
then I had a brainstorm.
What about food on wheels?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.311
I feel like
you're three ideas away

12:58.411 --> 13:01.314
from something that doesn't even
involve food.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.251
I was trying to think about
what this restaurant should be.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.253
And then I thought,
why reinvent the wheel?

13:06.353 --> 13:07.720
That's when it hit me.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.523
Wheels...
everywhere.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.825
Freddie, what do you think?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.726
I think I have a work call

13:13.827 --> 13:16.263
and I do not have time
for this tomfoolery.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.797
Mm, shenanigans, maybe.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.566
Tomfoolery, never!

13:19.666 --> 13:21.534
Whoo!
Coming back around!

13:21.634 --> 13:24.637
* He's got wheels
and he knows how to use 'em *

13:24.737 --> 13:25.973
You know what, dude,

13:26.073 --> 13:27.774
you were supposed
to be my partner in this,

13:27.875 --> 13:29.877
and you haven't done
one thing to help me.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.644
I pulled that rat
off your back.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.413
There was a rat on my back?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.285
Spencer, at this point
I think it would be better

13:38.385 --> 13:41.021
if you just left me alone.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.423
Fine.
I will--

13:43.523 --> 13:45.125
(gasps)

13:45.225 --> 13:46.493
No!

13:46.593 --> 13:48.828
Yusaku!

13:48.929 --> 13:50.763
Great.
I lost him.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.000
I know what we're all thinking.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.003
If the laptop was on wheels,
it wouldn't have broke.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.905
That's not what I'm thinking.

13:58.005 --> 14:01.708
I'm thinking this whole
situation is not working.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.676
Dude, you need to make
a decision, okay?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.078
You can keep playing restaurant

14:05.178 --> 14:06.646
or you can work
on the Kevin app.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.781
But you cannot do both!

14:12.252 --> 14:14.387
- Help me clean this mess up.
- Do I have to?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.356
Yes, and quickly,
before the rats come!

14:21.461 --> 14:23.130
Oh...

14:23.230 --> 14:25.465
I didn't think
you'd go through with it.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.700
I'm impressed.
Did it hurt?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.469
No.
I probably didn't feel it

14:29.569 --> 14:31.905
'cause I'm on so many drugs
and alcohols.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.008
Well, you know, Carly,
I think we checked all the boxes

14:35.108 --> 14:37.577
for a wild and crazy night.
You ready to go home?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.379
No way.
Let's keep going.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.081
Let's do more crazy stuff.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.884
I mean, kindergarten teachers
get drunk and get tattoos now.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.020
Not hating on them.
So necessary.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.788
But, like, we can do better.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.160
Why are you looking
at that fountain

14:53.260 --> 14:55.828
like a teenager
who just discovered porn?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.966
- No! No!
- Ah! Yes, yes, yes!

14:59.066 --> 15:00.533
- Carly!
- Yes!

15:00.633 --> 15:02.635
- No!
- Ah!

15:02.735 --> 15:04.371
What the hell, Carly?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.873
We're like the guys
on Jackass.

15:08.808 --> 15:09.909
Hi.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.478
You should exit
the fountain now.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.047
Carly, come on,
let's go home.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.149
This guy seems serious.
He's got a cell phone holster

15:16.249 --> 15:17.884
and a little gold
plastic badge.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.987
Ladies, just come out
of the fountain.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.990
Or what?
You gonna take us to mall jail?

15:26.994 --> 15:28.128
Did you guys steal
black lipstick

15:28.228 --> 15:29.997
to get back at your mom, too?

15:38.671 --> 15:39.939
All right,
here's our escape plan.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.208
- You distract the mall cop.
- With what?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.210
Okay, fine.
I'll sing!

15:43.310 --> 15:45.312
Yeah.
But if that doesn't work,

15:45.412 --> 15:47.147
- I can do my Borat impression.
- Ooh.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.381
It's the best.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.882
(clears throat)

15:49.983 --> 15:52.385
"My wife."

15:55.088 --> 15:56.889
Wait.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.491
Is this normal?

15:58.591 --> 16:02.362
I know we paid with a coupon,
but this doesn't seem right.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.064
Oh. Well,
when you first get them,

16:04.164 --> 16:06.866
real tattoos run
when they get wet, mm-hmm.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.204
Why'd you say "real tattoos"?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.839
So close.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.208
The tattoo's fake.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.977
I told the guy
to give you temporary ink.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.312
Why?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.281
Because you were only
getting it to prove

16:21.381 --> 16:22.849
how wild and crazy you are.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.718
And you wanted a rabbit
with all these weapons.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.421
You don't even like weapons,
or rabbits.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.359
I'm gonna need to take
your blood alcohol level.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.893
Blow into this.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.662
How high does it have to be
to get me in trouble?

16:35.762 --> 16:36.963
Because I have a feeling

16:37.064 --> 16:39.099
it's gonna be
much higher than that.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.505
Zero point zero.

16:48.908 --> 16:52.845
Yeah, there was no alcohol
in those drinks.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.881
And the drugs were fake as well.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.584
Look, ACD is just
vitamins A, C and D.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.353
You gave me
a Women's One-A-Day?

17:00.453 --> 17:03.123
Women's One-A-Day
for Seniors.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.159
Well, the joke's on you.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.027
'Cause I didn't take the ACD.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.630
I hid it under my tongue
and then I spit it out,

17:10.730 --> 17:13.766
like a girl in a movie
about an amoral mental hospital.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.435
I can't believe
you lied to me.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.138
Hey, all I wanted to do
was stay at home

17:19.239 --> 17:21.773
and watch Kacey
find herself through her pain.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.877
Instead, I'm out here playing
cool auntie to quiet niece.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.846
Was the guy I kissed fake, too?

17:26.945 --> 17:29.782
He's my dentist.
He thinks you're cute, though.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.684
You had me throw a drink
in his face.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.220
Well, that'll teach him
to tell me

17:33.320 --> 17:35.888
how hot my friends are
when he's cleaning my teeth.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.858
Harper giveth,
Harper taketh away.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.862
(exhaling sharply)

17:42.962 --> 17:45.998
Okay.
So, I made a list

17:46.099 --> 17:47.800
of all the reasons
to run the Groovy Smoothie

17:47.900 --> 17:49.869
and all the reasons to run
the Kevin app.

17:49.969 --> 17:55.041
Okay, under restaurant
I've got: run my own business,

17:55.142 --> 17:56.776
more keys,

17:56.876 --> 17:59.912
potential to become
a front for the Russian mob,

18:00.012 --> 18:04.817
and install a bidet,
but only for VIPs.

18:04.917 --> 18:09.289
And under Kevin app I've got:
I won't let Freddie down.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.658
Well, if you're going
with the longest list,

18:11.758 --> 18:12.925
I think it's clear.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.961
If you're going with
the dumbest list,

18:15.061 --> 18:16.329
it's also clear.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.031
Yeah, but how
do I tell Freddie?

18:19.132 --> 18:20.633
You just did.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.404
Wow, that was easier
than I expected.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.107
Look, let's face it, you're not
a good business partner.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.542
I said get an office,

18:29.642 --> 18:31.444
you got a restaurant
filled with rats.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.281
Instead of a launch party,
you threw me a funeral.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.683
I fear that every one
of your ideas from now on

18:36.783 --> 18:38.251
is going to involve wheels.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.587
I'd like to tell you that
you're wrong, but you're not.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.522
Wheels of cheese!

18:42.622 --> 18:44.324
I'm sorry, I can't stop.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.660
Look, this restaurant
is clearly scratching

18:47.760 --> 18:49.696
some creative itch
that you have.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.699
So, you should just do it, man.
I'll be fine.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.634
Yeah, but I don't want to
leave you hanging.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.203
Can I just give you money
and have nothing to do

18:56.303 --> 18:57.370
with the app whatsoever?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.206
Spencer,
go run your restaurant.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.673
You're the best.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.510
You know, if this
is gonna be your place,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.044
it should feel like you.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.913
Yeah, I like that.

19:07.013 --> 19:10.383
It needs to express
the essence of my very soul.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.821
I need to take what's in here
and what's in here,

19:14.921 --> 19:19.726
and put it on here,
and also in here.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.129
A new restaurant.
They rarely fail.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.532
Can it still pander
to the fans of the original?

19:25.632 --> 19:26.833
(scoffs)
Of course.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.801
How else are you
supposed to succeed?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.703
(both laughing lightly)

19:30.803 --> 19:33.640
(laughter intensifies)

19:38.345 --> 19:40.680
So, I guess you really do
think I'm boring.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.615
Why else would have you
faked all this?

19:42.715 --> 19:44.451
It's not about that.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.118
I just think that
the Carly I know

19:46.219 --> 19:48.187
wouldn't enjoy
a Harper night out.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.589
But that's okay.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.492
So, you don't think
I'm your boring friend?

19:52.592 --> 19:55.228
The fact that you're knitting
right now isn't helping.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.631
Oh, no, this is crocheting.
That's a common misconception.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.600
Okay, that's not helping,
either.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.370
But, Carly,
you're not my boring friend.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.739
You're my best friend,
and my smart friend,

20:06.839 --> 20:08.875
and my go-to-for-advice friend.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.643
You think I'd ask
any of those crazy fools

20:10.743 --> 20:12.078
I party with for advice?

20:12.178 --> 20:14.146
Their fix to every problem
is making a TikTok

20:14.247 --> 20:16.182
twerking in front
of an infinity pool.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.620
You know, the real reason
I faked this whole night

20:20.720 --> 20:22.655
was because I wanted
to look out for you,

20:22.755 --> 20:24.724
like you always
look out for me.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.659
This was my eggs Benny, baby.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.161
JEN:
You guys wanna
bust outta here?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.264
Stole this flare gun
from my mom's boat.

20:31.364 --> 20:36.135
Next time she gets lost at sea,
this'll show her.

20:37.404 --> 20:41.240
You know what?
I think I got this.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.945
Mr. Mall Cop!

20:48.147 --> 20:51.618
Oh, I couldn't help but notice
that framed picture on your desk

20:51.718 --> 20:53.420
of your beautiful
baby daughter.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.222
Do you think she might like
this one-of-a-kind,

20:56.323 --> 20:57.657
unique, hand-made scarf?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.025
Oh.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.661
This is almost as special
as she is.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.763
Thank you.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.031
Hey, if I let you guys go,
do you promise

21:05.131 --> 21:06.566
never to do anything
like this again?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.000
No.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.769
Eh, I don't care, we're closing

21:09.869 --> 21:11.404
in ten minutes anyways.
You can go.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.272
- (laughing)
- Yay.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.209
Look what Daddy got you.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.046
I still hate you
more than Mom.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.820
Never have I ever jumped
into a mall fountain

21:27.920 --> 21:31.257
and been put in mall jail.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.268
No one here can crochet.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.940
Guys, guys, guys!
After much deliberation,

21:48.040 --> 21:49.942
I have finally settled
on a new name

21:50.042 --> 21:51.378
for the Groovy Smoothie.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.146
At first, I considered
The Smooth Groove,

21:54.246 --> 21:56.816
but apparently that's a very
litigious jazz label.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.118
He also considered
The Smooth Move,

21:59.218 --> 22:02.154
but apparently that's a very
litigious laxative brand.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.958
So, we landed on this.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.762
Eh?

22:11.364 --> 22:12.899
Do you not see
what we're seeing?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.468
Of course I do.
Bar F!

22:15.568 --> 22:19.038
As in Bar Food,
Bar Fly, Bar Friends.

22:19.138 --> 22:23.309
Plus, we're on F Street.
Guys, it's the perfect name.

22:23.410 --> 22:27.380
Dude, you named
your restaurant Barf.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.517
I did do that,
didn't I?

22:30.617 --> 22:31.918
Man, I am really glad

22:32.018 --> 22:33.953
you don't work
on Kevin anymore.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.524
Really regretting
taking out all those ads

22:37.624 --> 22:39.826
that say
"Bar F, coming up soon."

22:39.926 --> 22:42.194
Why would I even
word it like that?

22:47.299 --> 22:49.536
* *

23:09.822 --> 23:11.524
Ooh!

23:11.624 --> 23:13.826
MAN:
He hates these cans.
