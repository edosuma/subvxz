00:01.001 --> 00:03.420
NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues…

00:03.503 --> 00:07.132
Operation Everglades requires
an annual search of the sewers

00:07.215 --> 00:09.092
for alligators by this department.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.554
I have been receiving obscene phone calls!

00:12.637 --> 00:15.306
Francis is slated
for divisional commander.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.476
If this street-killing's no big deal,
why you, Emil?

00:18.560 --> 00:21.604
Somebody must've liked her,
recruited her off the Hill.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.525
You think that's okay, Nemo?
Fourteen-year-old girls?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.402
-Sex club.
-That's right.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.820
With juvenile performers.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.947
Can I go home with you tonight?

00:32.532 --> 00:36.578
(indistinct station chatter)

00:36.661 --> 00:39.372
Yes, I do understand
everyone's displeasure

00:39.456 --> 00:41.541
with our malfunctioning heating system.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.001
(grunts of agreement)

00:43.084 --> 00:45.170
-However…
-(woman sneezes)

00:45.253 --> 00:48.882
…it, uh, behooves us…

00:48.965 --> 00:51.926
-(sneezes)
-MAN: God bless you.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.180
…as professionals,
to accept it in graceful stride.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.766
As far as the metaphorical light
at tunnel's end,

00:57.849 --> 01:00.852
Maintenance, just one half hour ago,
gave me his personal assurance

01:00.935 --> 01:03.313
that said furnace
will be functioning again

01:03.396 --> 01:06.441
-by midmorning.
-(groaning, murmuring)

01:06.524 --> 01:10.195
Yeah. Well, you know,
they have been known to lie, Sarge.

01:10.278 --> 01:14.324
Well, I can't deny the truth of that,
Washington, but what can we do?

01:14.407 --> 01:18.620
-They got us by the, uh…
-(laughing, murmuring)

01:18.703 --> 01:21.456
-…earlaps, as it were.
-MAN: Yeah.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.124
Our next item.

01:23.208 --> 01:28.088
Item 14 concerns basic maturity

01:28.171 --> 01:29.714
or lack of it

01:29.798 --> 01:33.176
or what is commonly called
stupidity in the extremis,

01:33.259 --> 01:37.180
which is to say, Sniper Alley.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.767
Once again, certain thrill-seekers
have insisted upon running

01:40.850 --> 01:43.603
the gauntlet of Sniper Alley
in their blues and whites

01:43.686 --> 01:45.230
in an attempt to draw rocks,

01:45.313 --> 01:48.191
bottles, and rifle fire
from the unfriendlies up there.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.986
Hear this: I will not have it.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.781
Captain Furillo will not have it.

01:54.864 --> 01:58.409
-Is that clear?
-(drill whirring)

01:59.619 --> 02:01.079
(surprised murmuring)

02:01.162 --> 02:02.580
WOMAN: They got it working?

02:04.999 --> 02:07.001
(men laughing)

02:07.085 --> 02:09.295
-(man coughs)
-WOMAN: Well, so much for that.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.842
Look, any uninvited incursions up there

02:13.925 --> 02:15.343
can seriously damage

02:15.426 --> 02:18.346
the captain's negotiations
with those people.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.308
So, let's remember
who and what we are, huh?

02:23.893 --> 02:26.312
And while I'm on the subject
of Captain Furillo…

02:26.396 --> 02:28.857
-(murmuring indistinctly)
-ESTERHAUS: Thank you.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.610
I find myself charged with making
a difficult and distressing announcement.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.779
Yes, the scuttlebutt
is more or less accurate.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.365
Captain Furillo is a prime candidate
for a promotion

02:37.448 --> 02:39.325
to commandership at Division.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.705
As a personal observation,
I think he's the abler man for the job.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.000
So, what say we gird our loins
for the worst.

02:47.083 --> 02:50.420
Such is life. Such is police work.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.548
All right. That's it. Hey, stay warm.

02:53.631 --> 02:54.716
And, uh…

02:54.799 --> 02:55.633
(chuckles)

02:55.717 --> 02:58.469
Let's be careful out there, huh?

02:58.553 --> 03:00.638
(chairs scraping)

03:01.973 --> 03:04.267
See a doctor, would ya, please?

03:05.518 --> 03:08.188
A homeopath… Take something.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.772
You got anything? I don't know.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.025
BATES: See somebody.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.695
(drill whirring)

03:19.073 --> 03:20.825
You guys were up at Gibson Heights, right?

03:20.909 --> 03:24.412
Yeah, six months' worth.
Before that, Midtown.

03:24.495 --> 03:28.416
Well, you guys sure move around a lot.
Sounds like someone's on your case.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.876
Yeah. Him.

03:29.959 --> 03:30.960
(chuckles)

03:31.044 --> 03:34.172
Thought there might be
a little bit more action up this way.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.716
Well, we've been known to stain
a few garments up here.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.092
(laughs)

03:38.176 --> 03:41.471
You mean, you really asked
to transfer to the Hill, hmm?

03:41.554 --> 03:44.265
MAN: Well,
I wouldn't put it that way exactly.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.810
But, uh, let's talk sometime, huh?

03:47.894 --> 03:48.978
Yeah.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.023
Y'all give us a call if you want to go eat
or something like that, huh?

03:52.106 --> 03:54.651
MAN: I think we have
the neighborhood pretty well laid out.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.612
I'll bet you do. Carmichael.
Seems like I heard them names before.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.448
It's not for publication,
but they're top of the "F" list.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.450
One more foul, and they're out.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.161
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:07.497
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:07.580 --> 04:11.251
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:18.174 --> 04:22.095
(theme music playing)

05:18.026 --> 05:19.986
Well, as soon as he gets in,
have him call me.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.822
Somebody over there dropped the ball
on my ex-wife's phone trace,

05:22.905 --> 05:23.990
and I want to know who.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.617
Well, then have him paged over there,

05:26.701 --> 05:29.329
and tell him to get in touch
with me or Ray Calletano.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.414
Yeah, you do that.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.874
Thank you.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.587
(sighs)

05:37.670 --> 05:40.506
-He's playing racquetball.
-Oh, nice!

05:40.590 --> 05:43.843
Frank, Frank Jr. was listening
on the other phone

05:43.926 --> 05:47.430
while that pervert was spewing
that twisted filth at me.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.017
Lord knows what an effect it's gonna have
on his emotional development.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.478
Well, he wouldn't have heard anything
if you had hung up.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.188
-Why didn't you just hang up?
-(sighs)

05:55.271 --> 05:57.440
Because your
racquetball-playing colleague,

05:57.523 --> 06:01.778
the mentally deficient Captain Ecker
of the Midtown Precinct, told me not to.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.906
He said, "We have tracing techniques,
Mrs. Furillo."

06:04.989 --> 06:07.158
-Like hell they do.
-Just take it easy.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.911
Where's Frank Jr. now?

06:09.994 --> 06:11.496
I want to have a little talk with him.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.457
Don't worry about it.
Harvey is taking care of it.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.168
Well, he is a professional, after all.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.753
Oh, great, Fay.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.256
And I am merely the boy's father.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.010
Excuse me, Francis, uh, Fay.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.846
You're running a good 20 minutes late.
Not wise, considering.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.849
Considering what? Are you late
for your racquetball game?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.394
Phil,

06:36.270 --> 06:37.688
get Fay a cup of coffee.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.566
Oh, sure. Run off.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.860
It's the story of your life,
isn't it, Frank?

06:42.944 --> 06:45.154
Deserting the people
who need you the most!

06:45.988 --> 06:49.367
Howard's the perfect example
of what I've been saying for years.

06:51.119 --> 06:51.953
Huh?

06:52.995 --> 06:55.373
Excuse me, Chief.
I didn't quite hear that.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.584
Come on, Howard. You hear every squeak
and bird chirp in this department.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.087
-(men chuckling)
-What I said was,

07:01.170 --> 07:03.339
we've come a long way
since the old potato-head,

07:03.423 --> 07:05.925
flatfoot image of bygone days.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.595
Howard over there has got his Ph.D.
Ed Chapel's got his master's.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.723
There's not a man in this room
who isn't a college graduate.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.935
And not a man in this room
can't hold his own

07:16.686 --> 07:19.647
with the bleeding-heart,
so-called intellectuals out there.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.691
FRANK (softly):
I told you I'd take care of it…

07:21.774 --> 07:23.234
Frank.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.320
-Chief.
-Nice to see you.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.156
-Ed.
-DANIELS: Glad you could come.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.740
(men chatting indistinctly)

07:29.824 --> 07:32.201
-Hello, Howard.
-Frank.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.036
Welcome to the big tepee, Frank.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.582
DANIELS: Gentlemen, while we're on
the subject of accomplishment,

07:37.665 --> 07:39.375
a little announcement's in order.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.211
(spoon clinking loudly)

07:42.295 --> 07:44.255
Want to tell 'em, Howard, or should I?

07:44.338 --> 07:45.631
(silence)

07:45.715 --> 07:47.300
All right. I'll do it.

07:47.842 --> 07:51.596
Gentlemen, Lieutenant Howard Hunter
is this year's recipient

07:51.679 --> 07:54.265
of the Police Association's
Mental Health Award.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.893
-(spoon clinking against china)
-(men clapping)

07:56.976 --> 08:00.062
DANIELS: Dave, I've got a good idea.

08:00.771 --> 08:01.814
What's that, Chief?

08:02.857 --> 08:05.276
Why don't we just put Ed and Frank
in a ring someplace

08:05.359 --> 08:07.528
and let 'em slug it out for commander?

08:07.612 --> 08:11.491
(men laughing)

08:15.328 --> 08:17.163
(coughing)

08:19.332 --> 08:22.210
(choking)

08:23.711 --> 08:26.547
(grunting)

08:26.631 --> 08:30.510
-FURILLO: You all right?
-(Daniels clears throat)

08:31.844 --> 08:35.014
Gee, Frank-- (clears throat)
That was a close one. Thank you.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.183
(pager beeping)

08:37.266 --> 08:39.227
-Whose is it?
-Is that you?

08:39.310 --> 08:41.270
-MAN 1: No, I'm clean.
-MAN 2: Not me.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.648
-(beeping continues, stops)
-It's mine.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.984
-(clears throat)
-FURILLO: Sorry. Chief.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.321
-Thank you, Frank. I'll see you.
-Take it easy, Frank.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.158
Well, that's what I'd call good timing.
(clears throat)

08:54.242 --> 08:56.577
(exhales)

08:59.205 --> 09:01.415
(indistinct station chatter)

09:03.668 --> 09:05.294
He'll take your statement.

09:06.921 --> 09:10.550
Guy got mugged comin' out of that, uh--
that glove factory on Water Street.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.635
Oh, New Deal Cap and Glove Company, huh?

09:12.718 --> 09:16.764
Yeah, they took his money, his watch,
and 20 dozen pairs of gloves.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.934
Such is the lot
of the small businessman these days.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.353
Hey, be supportive.
Give him a cup of the good coffee.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.772
-All right, Sarge.
-Keep up the good work.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.400
-I want to see you guys make good.
-MAN: Belker.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.360
(phone rings)

09:33.197 --> 09:34.448
It's him.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.285
I should've figured I'd find
that sawed-off little kike up here.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.120
-What'd you say?
-Shut up!

09:39.203 --> 09:41.372
BELKER:
Why is it so cold this morning, Leo?

09:41.455 --> 09:43.332
Nobody paid the utility bills again.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.585
Try rubbing a couple winos
together or something.

09:45.668 --> 09:49.255
(laughing): Winos.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.215
What say, Jew boy?

09:51.799 --> 09:54.760
-(phone rings)
-MAN: Hello, listen, I…

09:54.844 --> 09:57.888
-(growls)
-What's going on here?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.016
Personal.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.351
Been a while.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.564
What gives? What's with you two?

10:06.647 --> 10:09.233
I'd like to voice a complaint
against this officer's

10:09.317 --> 10:10.943
vicious anti-Semitic remarks!

10:11.027 --> 10:12.778
In a minute, sir. Ludwig?

10:15.197 --> 10:16.198
This.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.036
He owes me one from back at the academy.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.998
No one believed me when I told 'em
the little scum bit my finger off.

10:24.081 --> 10:28.502
-Stop it. Come on. Come on.
-All right, Ludwig. All right.

10:28.961 --> 10:33.132
-(phone rings)
-(indistinct station chatter)

10:34.008 --> 10:36.093
I'll do the best I can, Lieutenant.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.305
-That's all I can promise.
-(phone rings)

10:39.388 --> 10:42.099
-You find a peaceful solution, Mick.
-BATES: Yeah, Hill Street.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.017
Or else…

10:43.100 --> 10:44.393
BATES: Yeah, Captain.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.271
-I said I'll try.
-BATES: Just a second. Lieutenant?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.065
It's the captain. Line three.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.860
-(phone rings)
-(indistinct station chatter)

10:55.488 --> 10:56.572
Go ahead, Frank.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.033
Frank?

10:59.909 --> 11:00.993
Frank.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.121
(exhales)

11:04.205 --> 11:05.956
Where the hell is Marv?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.542
Nothing works in this place.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.045
No furnace, no phone, no nothing!

11:11.128 --> 11:13.756
I'll get him, okay? I'll get him.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.008
(steps coming downstairs)

11:17.927 --> 11:19.553
They're raisin' hell upstairs, Marv.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.889
There's only two phones workin'
in the entire joint…

11:22.598 --> 11:25.142
For cryin' out loud.
Marv, are you sleeping?

11:26.602 --> 11:27.895
(scoffs)

11:33.901 --> 11:35.569
Real cute, Marv.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.823
Want to stop screwing around?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.119
Marv…

11:46.455 --> 11:48.290
(sad music playing)

11:48.374 --> 11:49.625
Oh, my…

11:54.922 --> 11:56.757
(steps going upstairs)

11:56.841 --> 11:59.218
(action music playing)

12:06.851 --> 12:08.269
How ya doing, Abe?

12:11.772 --> 12:13.941
-Hello, Emil.
-Frank.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.735
He's in Room D, Captain.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.490
WOMAN (over P.A.): <i>Would the</i>
<i>deputy assistant to D.A. Kiley's office</i>

12:21.574 --> 12:23.951
<i>please pick up a message</i>
<i>at the front desk?</i>

12:25.536 --> 12:28.247
Can you give me a little hint
what's going on here?

12:28.330 --> 12:31.125
All I know is
the public defender said "urgent."

12:31.208 --> 12:32.293
Urgent, huh?

12:32.376 --> 12:33.878
Well, in case you hadn't heard,

12:33.961 --> 12:36.213
they've kicked
this Nemo Rodriguez thing upstairs.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.132
You know who's in there with him now?

12:38.215 --> 12:40.634
The female barracuda, Davenport.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.804
Now I wouldn't lie to you, Frank,
but I'm blaming you

12:43.888 --> 12:45.806
for this screwing around
wasting of my time.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.600
And I'm telling you something else, kid.

12:47.683 --> 12:50.603
You would never have done it
if you hadn't been humping for commander.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.939
Oh, well. (sighs)

12:56.066 --> 12:58.194
Politics is politics, hmm?

13:01.322 --> 13:04.575
I just hate to see a good guy
sinking in that swamp.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.535
(indistinct inmates' chatter)

13:10.456 --> 13:12.333
(gate buzzing)

13:17.671 --> 13:19.340
RODRIGUEZ: I had nothing at the house,

13:19.423 --> 13:22.343
so I went over to this after-hours place
to go pick up a bottle, right?

13:23.052 --> 13:26.013
Okay. I come back maybe 20 minutes later,

13:26.096 --> 13:28.516
and I'm on the stairs
when I hear the gun go off.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.601
I hear a crash, too,

13:30.684 --> 13:34.104
and then this guy comes tearing out
the door and down the stairs.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.900
Bam! Throws me against the wall,
so I don't have no chance to grab him.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.069
I mean,
I didn't have no chance at all, right?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.112
But it was him, man.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.365
See, no doubt about that
because I met him one time

13:44.448 --> 13:47.159
when I went over to go see Rose
in a place he set her up in.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.996
Tell the captain and the lieutenant
the man's name.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.377
It was McAurley, the councilman guy.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.089
(laughing)

14:01.674 --> 14:03.425
Don't do this, kid.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.970
You got a great imagination, but…

14:06.053 --> 14:08.013
(laughing)

14:08.097 --> 14:09.974
His prints are all over the murder weapon.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.726
He's told us
two cock-and-bull stories already.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.020
He's a very creative kid.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.106
Councilman McAurley.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.570
What's this?

14:25.114 --> 14:26.949
It's the apartment address.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.077
I wouldn't think
it too difficult to ascertain

14:30.160 --> 14:32.997
if the victim was being kept and by whom.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.501
I'd like it searched as soon as possible.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.840
I think that's a reasonable request.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.560
DAVENPORT: I called his office.
He's been in and out all morning.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.520
Thought I'd stop by on the way uptown.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.440
Look, Frank, I know how tight
McAurley is with the department,

14:59.523 --> 15:01.567
and if Schneider won't talk to him,

15:01.650 --> 15:03.944
I'll just have the D.A. subpoena him.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.238
Now wait a minute.
What if he has nothing to do with it?

15:06.322 --> 15:08.574
You know as well as I do,
it's gonna be all over the news.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.242
Besides that, Schneider has a point.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.453
The kid hasn't told the same story twice.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.247
-Do you believe him?
-I don't know yet.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.667
Frank, I want to see you make commander,

15:19.919 --> 15:22.880
and for more reasons
than just the shape of your nose.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.925
You let me worry about that, okay?

15:27.259 --> 15:28.510
I think we're asking for it

15:28.594 --> 15:30.971
if we don't give it a rest
until this thing is over.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.598
And don't do that.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.850
-And don't give me an argument.
-(sighs)

15:35.643 --> 15:40.272
All we need is a rumor of collusion
between the P.D.'s office and you.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.529
Let me have Skip Fitzgerald subpoena
the councilman and get it over with.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.032
No, no, no. Hold off on that.
I need a little more time.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.368
And I'll see you later.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.162
Frank, you're not listening to me.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.498
I'm making good sense.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.958
You're serious?

15:59.625 --> 16:03.170
(theme music playing)

16:06.507 --> 16:07.633
Joyce?

16:10.177 --> 16:11.303
(horn blares)

16:16.225 --> 16:20.270
-(sighs): What was Marv, maybe 38, 40?
-(indistinct chatter over radio)

16:20.354 --> 16:22.606
-More like 32.
-(groans)

16:24.566 --> 16:28.028
See, I knew he wasn't feeling so hot,
but who knew?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.949
Well, when the icy hand of darkness

16:32.032 --> 16:34.910
decides to expunge the flame of life,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.662
none of us is immune--

16:36.745 --> 16:39.498
not even one so young and gifted as Marv.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.709
Oh, man. I was depressed enough already.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.961
Tell him to cool it, will you, Neal?

16:44.044 --> 16:46.505
The man's right on the mark, babe.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.258
Life, death, eternity,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.176
et cetera.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.137
Marv.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.099
Marv. Marv.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.144
Greatest phone man
this department ever had.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.563
-Fastest cable layer in the business.
-Marv--

17:02.646 --> 17:04.857
-Guy had the hands of a surgeon.
-Marv--

17:04.940 --> 17:07.985
ESTERHAUS: Strange.
I can't seem to recall his last name.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.238
-CALLETANO: Marv--
-Marv, uh…

17:11.321 --> 17:14.116
-Uh-- (murmurs)
-Marv-- No, wait a minute.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.410
Guy's name was Carpenter
or something like that.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.871
-Carpenter.
-No. No, no, no.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.123
-Wood? Maybe it was Wood?
-HINGLE: Thorpe.

17:21.665 --> 17:25.294
-Yeah, Marv Thorpe.
-No, it was more fishlike sounding,

17:25.377 --> 17:29.089
-like, uh, Marv Trout.
-LARUE: No.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.258
LEO: Marv, uh-- Marv Clark.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.260
(men continue guessing indistinctly)

17:33.343 --> 17:34.803
MAN: They're coming up.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.722
(all slowly fall silent)

17:36.805 --> 17:38.557
Oh, man.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.935
Man.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.563
A little too stiff to get in the body bag.

17:44.646 --> 17:48.192
Oh, I, uh, need his full I.D.
on this 10-50 form, please.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.361
Phil, I know Marv would want you to do it.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.529
All right.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.949
I guess I'll have to admit that we're
confronting a minor embarrassment here.

17:56.033 --> 17:56.909
You see--

17:59.161 --> 18:01.246
Judas H. Priest.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.332
That's Marv Box.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.626
MAN (whispering): Oh, Box. That's it.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.419
-Box.
-WOMAN: I knew that.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.297
-MAN: I knew it was something like that.
-WOMAN: Box. It was Box.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.092
Rigor mortis.
He must've bought it hours ago.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.135
I don't think he bought anything,
Lieutenant.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.595
He just went-- (clicks tongue)

18:19.807 --> 18:23.352
We console ourselves
that he died with his boots on--

18:23.811 --> 18:27.481
drill rampant in the cause of duty,

18:28.190 --> 18:29.274
honor,

18:30.234 --> 18:31.610
country.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.780
Good-bye, old friend.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.907
-Amen.
-ALL: Amen.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.534
MAN: Oh, man.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.996
FURILLO: I want someone on the phone
from now until we pin him down.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.707
McAurley's office, McAurley's phone,

18:45.791 --> 18:47.501
the council chambers, the works.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.962
-Oh, and Henry Goldblume.
-Here, Frank.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.216
What's going on?

18:54.299 --> 18:58.470
Well, Francis, while you were downtown,
we lost a man.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.389
Marv.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.308
Marv? Marv Box?

19:04.351 --> 19:07.604
He's dead? How? What happened?

19:07.688 --> 19:10.399
Well, it's still unknown
at this point in time.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.152
Had to be either heart or brain.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.195
Maybe his stomach.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.198
No, I don't think stomach, Ray.
Not directly anyway.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.702
Stomach by me includes kidneys and liver.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.829
-I don't think so.
-Well, I do.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.249
He was 32 years old, tops.

19:27.332 --> 19:31.044
-(indistinct station chatter)
-(distant phone ringing)

19:32.963 --> 19:34.673
Pull his file, will ya, Phil?

19:35.674 --> 19:38.594
-I better call his wife.
-Oh, we got it right here, Francis.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.181
We've gone through it, and according to
what we've got here, he wasn't married.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.517
Nor was there any next of kin--
no one, not a soul.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.854
He walked among us a stranger.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.735
Uh, excuse me, guys.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.029
Hey.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.032
In light of what's happened here today,

20:00.115 --> 20:02.910
has anyone given any more thought
to my investment?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.870
It's an annuity for our loved ones,

20:04.953 --> 20:07.331
and it's still a thousand bucks a share
to friends.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.999
(groans)

20:11.084 --> 20:14.463
Uh, maybe I ought to talk to Rachel again.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.426
Yeah, maybe
I'll, uh, give Grace a call, huh?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.720
And Cindy, naturally.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.979
For a thousand, why not?

20:33.899 --> 20:36.360
Think of it, Ray-- Marv--

20:36.860 --> 20:38.445
the Saloondromat.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.822
There's a meaningful tie-in there.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.498
-Condolences, Frank.
-Thank you, Howard.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.458
What can I do for you, Howard?

20:51.541 --> 20:54.920
A little edgy, Frank. Uh--

20:55.003 --> 20:57.547
Well, it's not every day
that you lose a good soldier,

20:57.631 --> 20:59.549
but, uh, the war goes on.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.509
Do you mind?

21:02.052 --> 21:04.930
I have a little goody here, <i>mon ami,</i>

21:05.013 --> 21:07.599
that is gonna rotate your day 180 degrees

21:07.683 --> 21:09.393
and leave you walking away from that desk

21:09.476 --> 21:11.144
smelling like a new bicycle seat.

21:11.228 --> 21:15.232
I'm not sure I want to walk away
from this desk yet, Howard.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.692
Nonsense, Frank.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.653
You have crossed the line of departure.
It's lock-and-load time.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.489
That little Heimlich you did on the chief
this morning saw to that.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.908
Oh, come on, Howard.
I just happened to be there.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.660
That's my point exactly.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.954
It is kismet.

21:29.037 --> 21:34.710
Old Ed Chapel would suck brown floss
for a year to make those kind of points.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.003
So, let's…

21:36.586 --> 21:38.297
Let's put the icing on the puck.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.761
(exhales)

21:45.679 --> 21:47.389
I'm afraid to ask.

21:48.390 --> 21:52.269
It's a Personnel Armored
N-series Defense Attack vehicle.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.229
Acronym: PANDA.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.982
It's made by Nishitsu Corporation, Frank,

21:57.065 --> 22:00.402
and the one we've gotten,
it has been modified for urban warfare.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.362
-That's--
-Wait a minute.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.533
We're getting one of these?

22:07.617 --> 22:09.828
What the hell for, Howard?

22:12.497 --> 22:14.166
For Sniper Alley, Frank.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.460
No, no, no, no.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.004
No, Howard. No tanks!

22:19.504 --> 22:22.674
We're negotiating peace with those people,
and we're making inroads.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.510
You can't make inroads
with third-world baboons.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.554
Besides, it's a fait accompli.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.182
The chief has already
put his stamp of approval on it.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.642
-In writing?
-Check.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.436
Check, huh?

22:36.271 --> 22:37.439
We'll see about that.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.108
Ray, can--

22:41.485 --> 22:43.487
You need me, Frank? Here I am.

22:44.237 --> 22:47.866
-Would you come in here, please?
-Sure, Frank. Absolutely.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.744
-Howard.
-Commander. Uh--

22:50.827 --> 22:53.914
Frank, could you close the door
and pull the shades?

22:53.997 --> 22:57.000
We are standing here
in the buff, security-wise.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.419
Well, let's just take a chance, Howard.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.879
Judas H.--

23:01.671 --> 23:03.131
What do you know about this?

23:04.633 --> 23:06.676
Just a little new technology, Frank.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.639
You know the chief's appetite
for, uh, hardware.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.059
Yeah, well, if the chief likes it so much,

23:14.142 --> 23:15.894
why doesn't he take it home with him?

23:15.977 --> 23:17.979
I won't have it in my precinct.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.107
Let's not go off the deep end, Frank.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.692
Just a subject for study.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.363
We'll field-test it
and see where it takes us.

23:26.446 --> 23:30.283
We're not testing it in my precinct, Dave,
not as long as I'm captain.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.160
-Very impressive, Howard.
-Thank you.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.496
I appreciate your misgivings, Frank.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.248
Don't think I don't.

23:36.331 --> 23:39.126
Howard, would you, uh…

23:39.209 --> 23:41.753
Oh! Oh. Yeah, sure.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.257
(blows)

23:45.340 --> 23:46.591
Ciao, Frank.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.222
Furnace still on the fritz, huh?

23:52.305 --> 23:54.599
It's… brisk in here.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.935
What's on your mind, Dave?

23:57.018 --> 23:57.978
You.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.314
What have you got
against Councilman Tom McAurley?

24:02.149 --> 24:03.316
Not a thing.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.403
But a murder suspect has implicated him,

24:06.486 --> 24:09.406
and I thought I would look into it
before the press does.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.491
Let Emil Schneider do it.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.579
Frank, do you want that commandership?

24:16.371 --> 24:17.289
Huh?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.667
I don't know.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.461
What are you afraid of?

24:22.878 --> 24:25.172
That this precinct
can't survive without you?

24:26.548 --> 24:27.924
Or are you afraid it can?

24:28.341 --> 24:33.513
I've got a murder victim
who was a veteran prostitute at age 15.

24:33.597 --> 24:37.184
She didn't land
in either place by herself.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.061
-Don't preach at me, Frank.
-Who's involved here?

24:40.145 --> 24:41.938
Who's Schneider covering for?

24:42.022 --> 24:44.858
That's reckless talk, Frank,
and it's not like you.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.736
Schneider's doing
the same job he always does.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.029
(curtain whooshes)

24:51.114 --> 24:52.491
Do me a favor.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.992
Trust me on this one.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.995
Let Homicide handle it.

25:08.423 --> 25:11.510
Between what I got in pledges
and the cash and the checks here,

25:11.593 --> 25:13.512
a grand from you
is gonna put us over the top.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.846
Uh-uh. (chuckles)

25:14.930 --> 25:16.973
I got 3,200 in your markers already, babe.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.185
I'm not asking you for a loan. I'm trying
to give you a shot at the brass ring.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.102
Yeah, sure.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.605
-What are we stopping for?
-Guy back there.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.690
He's selling cigarettes
out the back of his car.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.485
Come on, man. The dude's doing
a little business. So what?

25:28.568 --> 25:30.779
Look, I've got the real estate guy
waiting on me.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.698
-I've got Goldblume waiting on me.
-Uh-uh-uh.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.537
MAN: Hey, hey, ho. What ya smoking, bro?

25:38.620 --> 25:41.206
-Hey, what you got here, man?
-I can give you a real good price.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.543
-Valiant.
-Yeah, uh, you got any money on you, man?

25:44.626 --> 25:47.546
Oh, man. Why do I always
have to go in my wallet, huh?

25:50.674 --> 25:53.343
-(Washington chuckles)
-(laughs)

25:53.426 --> 25:54.678
Oh, no.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.181
Oh, damn.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.559
Oh, and I just drove up from Kentucky.

26:00.642 --> 26:01.726
Is that right?

26:01.810 --> 26:03.603
(laughs)

26:03.687 --> 26:05.355
-Okay, ya got me.
-Come on.

26:05.438 --> 26:07.607
If we take this guy in,
I'm gonna blow my meeting.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.152
Hey, look, man. It's too blatant, J.D.
It's insulting, man.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.822
(theme music playing)

26:15.323 --> 26:17.659
All right, who stole my blanket?

26:17.742 --> 26:19.160
I'm tired of it.

26:48.648 --> 26:49.858
What do you think?

26:54.779 --> 26:55.905
Nice.

26:57.907 --> 27:01.328
(door creaks)

27:01.411 --> 27:03.038
This is it, Henry.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.748
Saloondromat.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.958
Now, the bar,
it's gonna be like it is now.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.085
It's gonna run the whole length
of the room, huh?

27:09.169 --> 27:10.086
But, uh…

27:10.170 --> 27:13.089
But we're gonna extend it out there
into the back and all the way over.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.966
Stylish! You know, you got vision.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.760
You got vision.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.930
See this area right over here, huh?

27:21.014 --> 27:24.768
This whole area is gonna be the machines,
the washers, the dryers…

27:24.851 --> 27:26.603
but we're going to fix it up

27:26.686 --> 27:28.813
so they don't, like,
stick out all over the place.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.066
You know what I mean?
It's really tacky. Uh…

27:31.149 --> 27:33.193
Kind of, like, cover them
and have TV screens--

27:33.276 --> 27:36.821
TV screens, right? From over there
at the bar you watch your wash!

27:38.114 --> 27:39.991
-(sarcastically): Watch your wash?
-Yeah.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.202
(interested): Watch your wash.

27:42.285 --> 27:43.370
I like it.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.124
Millions, Henry. Millions.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.710
-Mr. Calabrese, one minute, all right?
-All right.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.589
-Neal--
-No.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.926
Look. Look, I got the guy down
as low as he's gonna go.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.595
He'll even throw in
a year full of free beer coasters.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.889
-What do you say?
-Hey, hey, hey. J.D., man--

28:02.972 --> 28:05.767
Ah, look, I'll pay you back first.
I swear it.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.437
I got something here, man. I know I do.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.816
What are we without a dream?

28:13.942 --> 28:14.984
Think of Marv.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.028
Want to end up like that?

28:17.570 --> 28:19.489
We're all gonna end up like Marv.

28:20.740 --> 28:24.119
Not till we're 80, riding two chicks
sidesaddle in a basket chair.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.662
(laughs)

28:25.745 --> 28:27.956
All that
from a little old Saloondromat, man?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.958
(chuckles)

28:30.041 --> 28:30.917
(sighs)

28:31.000 --> 28:34.129
From, uh, little acorns
mighty corporations grow.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.339
Look at the phone company, man.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.134
They started out
with a string and two Dixie cups.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.219
(traffic noises)

28:42.679 --> 28:44.055
(sighs)

28:44.139 --> 28:46.224
(theme music playing)

28:46.307 --> 28:47.392
(exhales)

28:47.475 --> 28:49.269
Ah, what the hell.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.563
A little upward mobility
never hurt nobody.

28:51.646 --> 28:55.316
-(laughs)
-Whoo! I got it!

28:55.400 --> 28:57.026
Whew. (laughs)

28:57.110 --> 28:58.820
Oh, man.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.533
(tires squealing)

29:03.616 --> 29:08.788
ESTERHAUS: Oh, I don't know, Grace.
Life is so momentary.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.416
I'm all of a sudden saying to myself,

29:11.499 --> 29:16.087
"Phil Esterhaus,
don't let the important things slide."

29:16.171 --> 29:17.881
-(phone ringing)
-(typing)

29:17.964 --> 29:20.842
I know exactly what you mean, Phil.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.844
You know, in that sense,

29:23.470 --> 29:25.346
Sam's death

29:25.430 --> 29:27.766
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.017
Hmm.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.770
In light of which, I've been thinking

29:31.853 --> 29:35.190
about that long weekend
that we've been talking about.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.066
Oh, Phil.

29:37.901 --> 29:41.738
You mean Las Casitas Garden
of Eden Retreat in Mexico?

29:41.821 --> 29:44.741
Well, why wait? We have each other.
We have now.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.036
What is the future, really?

29:49.078 --> 29:50.580
A throw of the dice.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.123
(chuckles)

29:52.207 --> 29:54.751
And you're not worried
it's a naturalist retreat?

29:54.834 --> 29:58.588
Well, given the ambient temperature
indoors and out,

29:58.671 --> 30:01.299
my main thrust is warm sunshine,

30:02.342 --> 30:05.595
soft breezes, loose tropical clothing.

30:06.095 --> 30:08.139
(laughs)

30:08.223 --> 30:09.641
You mean no clothing.

30:10.099 --> 30:12.060
-(phone ringing)
-No clothing?

30:12.143 --> 30:13.978
Well, it's a nudist retreat.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.399
You mean, everybody is naked?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.735
Oh.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.154
That does make you anxious.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.405
No.

30:24.864 --> 30:27.909
I've been among thousands
of nude persons in my day.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.287
Then it's settled.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.832
I'm going to take care of everything.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.668
Plane tickets, reservations…

30:39.212 --> 30:41.756
And I'm not going to forget

30:41.840 --> 30:46.094
that crème de cacao lotion
you find so exhilarating.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.428
Ooh.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.139
(both laughing)

30:52.809 --> 30:54.269
(sighs): Ah, well.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.313
I had such hopes for this dump.

30:57.939 --> 31:00.066
(clears throat)

31:03.236 --> 31:04.988
Councilman McAurley--

31:05.071 --> 31:07.532
He's dropped off the end
of the world, Frank.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.201
He's not in his office. He's not home.
He's not anywhere.

31:10.285 --> 31:13.162
<i>-And no one's speaking to me.</i>
-You try city council?

31:13.246 --> 31:15.540
-He's not there either.
<i>-I'll tell you what.</i>

31:15.623 --> 31:17.750
Uh, check with his lawyer.
Maybe he's there.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.878
And get back to me, Alf. I want him.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.379
Okay, Frank.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.339
(traffic noises)

31:24.132 --> 31:26.342
(indistinct radio chatter)

31:26.426 --> 31:28.970
Call the clerk. See if you can speed up
that search warrant.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.013
All right.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.225
(indistinct chatter)

31:34.309 --> 31:36.352
-LaRue.
-Washington.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.979
Neal, I'm telling you.

31:38.062 --> 31:41.774
Neal, for a thousand dollars,
you're gonna be a very, very rich man.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.943
Yeah, it seems like
I heard this before, man.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.529
Well? Well? Did we get it?

31:46.613 --> 31:49.324
Get it? Honey, I had the poor fool
eating out of my hands.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.701
You just clear out a little room
in your bank account.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.786
-(laughs)
-Hey, take a seat, Bruce.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.413
(phone rings)

31:57.624 --> 32:00.293
Got something for you, sunshine.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.212
(phone rings)

32:05.715 --> 32:08.384
-Detective Belker.
-WOMAN (on phone):<i> It's your mama.</i>

32:08.468 --> 32:09.594
BELKER: Hi, Ma.

32:11.846 --> 32:15.558
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.
I'm working. That's all.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.519
-(indistinct talking over phone)
-(sighs): Okay, I'm smiling.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.063
I am. I'm smiling.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.148
(phone ringing)

32:22.982 --> 32:25.360
No, I haven't talked to Debbie
in a few days.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.656
No, there's no special reason.
I'm just busy. That's all.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.616
Did you call me for a special reason?

32:32.200 --> 32:36.037
<i>♪ Hava nagila, hava nagila ♪</i>

32:36.120 --> 32:37.956
<i>♪ Hava nagila… ♪</i>

32:38.039 --> 32:40.249
BELKER: Uh, Ma--

32:40.333 --> 32:41.709
He's calling his mom.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.588
Probably off to a kibbutz,
know what I'm saying?

32:45.672 --> 32:47.715
Aw, please, Ma. The man is 83 years old.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.635
If he wants to drink a cup of hot water
before he goes to bed,

32:50.718 --> 32:51.678
what's the big deal?

32:51.761 --> 32:54.430
-(mom speaking angrily over phone)
-Those things happen, Ma.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.474
That's what you got a washing machine for.

32:56.557 --> 32:59.060
<i>♪ Hava nagila ♪</i>

33:00.603 --> 33:03.940
I gotta hang up, Ma. I got work here.
I'll call you back. Good-bye.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.525
(phone slams down)

33:05.984 --> 33:09.320
-(drawer slams)
-Don't do it, man. He'll eat you alive.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.280
LUDWIG: What am I doing?

33:14.325 --> 33:17.620
-What is it exactly I'm doing?
-(chair clatters)

33:20.373 --> 33:22.834
Leave me alone, Ludwig.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.003
What's the matter?

33:25.878 --> 33:27.630
You scared to take me on again?

33:29.048 --> 33:31.759
Is it against your dietary laws?

33:32.385 --> 33:35.555
The past is the past, Ludwig.
You just let it lie.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.933
You're chicken soup, Belker.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.769
-(growling)
-LUDWIG: Ah, yeah. That's it.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.062
Come on.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.398
Come on.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.743
-You--
-Take it easy, man.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.077
Don't do it.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.790
(exhales, scoffs)

34:02.874 --> 34:04.417
(inaudible)

34:04.834 --> 34:08.004
Uh, Officer Carmichael, Ludwig,

34:08.087 --> 34:10.798
uh, in the captain's office, please.

34:10.882 --> 34:11.924
Sure, Sarge.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.470
-Stay right there.
-Hey, do you mind?

34:15.553 --> 34:18.347
(indistinct station chatter)

34:23.102 --> 34:24.270
(clears throat)

34:26.689 --> 34:31.110
This regards certain remarks
of an anti-Semitic persuasion.

34:32.236 --> 34:35.698
Said remarks are tasteless in the extremis

34:35.782 --> 34:38.910
and will not be tolerated
in this precinct!

34:39.744 --> 34:41.496
Am I perfectly lucid?

34:45.124 --> 34:46.626
Yes, sir. (sighs)

34:47.126 --> 34:50.254
In addition, I have noticed,
in my perusal of the parking lot,

34:50.338 --> 34:53.049
that your unit has sustained
considerable shooting damage--

34:53.132 --> 34:55.676
the rear windows, the top lights

34:55.760 --> 34:58.554
and, most noticeably,
the driver's side door.

34:58.638 --> 35:02.725
I thought I made myself quite clear
regarding runs through Sniper Alley.

35:02.809 --> 35:07.021
We just took the wrong turn is all,
uh, being new here.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.273
Yeah. At least we got your shooter.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.359
Oh, yes. The shooter, huh?

35:11.692 --> 35:12.860
And the weapon?

35:14.654 --> 35:16.364
He must've ditched it in the chase.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.241
Rooftops… You know how that goes.

35:18.324 --> 35:20.451
Ah, yes, the chase.

35:20.993 --> 35:24.038
Tell me, Ludwig, how have you two
managed to stay in uniforms

35:24.122 --> 35:27.917
that you so continually
and habitually disgrace?

35:31.003 --> 35:34.006
How about let's not book him, huh?

35:34.715 --> 35:38.052
Throw him in Holding till he dries out
and then hit the bricks.

35:39.220 --> 35:42.515
Until further notice,
you two are assigned foot patrol.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.809
Foot patrol? But it's cold out there,
Sarge! You ca--

35:44.892 --> 35:46.894
No problem, Sergeant.

35:46.978 --> 35:50.439
Just, uh, let me reconnoiter
another sweater, we'll be on our way.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.872
-(footsteps approaching)
-(door opens)

36:09.041 --> 36:10.042
Belker.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.753
(panting)

36:12.837 --> 36:16.048
There's no getting away, you little hebe.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.508
Just you and me.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.553
Right now.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.933
(growling)

36:29.020 --> 36:31.189
(shouting)

36:32.690 --> 36:34.275
(phone ringing)

36:36.152 --> 36:37.570
Oh, Francis?

36:38.487 --> 36:40.531
I have a few messages here for you.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.118
(laughs)

36:45.286 --> 36:46.621
(muffled thudding)

36:49.707 --> 36:51.959
-(thudding continues)
-Where's Belker?

36:52.043 --> 36:53.294
Locker room.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.346
(man groans)

37:04.263 --> 37:05.932
(Belker shouting)

37:06.015 --> 37:08.184
-(punches landing)
-LUDWIG: Fuck!

37:08.267 --> 37:10.102
(Belker shouting)

37:10.186 --> 37:12.730
(both grunting)

37:14.106 --> 37:16.859
-FURILLO: Hey, hey, hey!
-ESTERHAUS: Mick! Mick, let go.

37:17.985 --> 37:20.613
-Come on!
-Mick, stop it!

37:21.322 --> 37:23.282
All right. Let me see the damage.

37:23.366 --> 37:26.369
-What the hell happened?
-(panting)

37:26.452 --> 37:27.995
He damn near bit off another one!

37:28.079 --> 37:30.039
You were warned,
but you didn't listen, huh?

37:30.122 --> 37:32.708
Lucy, wrap this in a towel
and get him to Emergency.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.627
I couldn't help it, Captain.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.463
He wouldn't leave me alone.

37:38.214 --> 37:39.590
Get that cleaned up and dressed.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.384
(both panting)

37:43.386 --> 37:44.804
Then I want to see you in my office.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.600
(panting)

37:49.684 --> 37:50.851
(whispering): Come on.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.858
(theme music playing)

38:10.037 --> 38:12.039
-(phone rings)
-(indistinct station chatter)

38:12.123 --> 38:14.583
-You got me good, huh?
-This is gonna go straight to the top.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.127
It doesn't make any… Let's face it.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.296
It doesn't make any sense
putting me in that cage.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.464
My lawyer's on his way
right up here. Right--

38:20.548 --> 38:23.342
Hey, wait! Wait--
I'm in the-- I'm in the bus--

38:23.426 --> 38:25.553
I'm a businessman.
I'm in the cigarette business.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.637
That's life.

38:27.847 --> 38:28.681
Hi.

38:28.764 --> 38:31.225
-(keys rattling)
-(chattering)

38:31.309 --> 38:34.520
-Wait. No.
-Come on. There you go.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.731
Heat.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.941
Sergeant, I think the heat's back on.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.401
Hey! The heat's on!

38:40.484 --> 38:41.861
Heat, Ray.

38:41.944 --> 38:44.196
Back to normal, finally.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.490
A transition, as it were.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.492
A return to normalcy.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.786
-(door opens)
-(woman giggling)

38:50.870 --> 38:52.663
(phone ringing)

39:02.214 --> 39:07.011
Francis, the way I saw it, I'd say
Belker used admirable restraint.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.556
All right, this is the way the beef ends.

39:10.639 --> 39:13.476
Ludwig and Carmichael
are out of this precinct.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.603
Today, if we can.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.606
With pleasure, Francis.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.566
You see any teeth marks?

39:20.649 --> 39:23.361
No. It looked like a clean bite.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.363
Guys, excuse me.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.075
I found this in the men's room.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.413
-It's Marv's.
-ESTERHAUS: Hmm.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.665
I know this sounds a little maudlin,

39:36.749 --> 39:40.628
but, uh, this is
about all we have left of him.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.713
Maybe put it in a trophy case?

39:42.797 --> 39:44.840
We don't have a trophy case, Henry.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.385
Well, maybe we can buy one, build one.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.929
Call it the Marv Memorial Trophy Case.

39:50.012 --> 39:52.807
Frank. Frank, look. Frank, look.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.351
(crying)

39:56.811 --> 39:59.522
-Fay, what's the matter? What's going on?
-Oh, Frank!

40:00.064 --> 40:01.732
Uh, excuse us, would you, please?

40:02.483 --> 40:06.070
I-- I was--
I was going to pick up Frank Jr.,

40:06.862 --> 40:10.157
but I decided to go home first
and get dinner started.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.576
But the minute I opened the door,

40:13.327 --> 40:16.330
I had this feeling
that something was wrong.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.749
(sobbing)

40:18.833 --> 40:22.044
All right. It's okay. All right.
Pull yourself together. Come on. Come on.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.838
-(Fay sniffling)
-FURILLO: Talk to me.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.049
FAY: Well, I heard the water
running in the bathroom,

40:27.133 --> 40:30.970
and I didn't think I had left it on,
but sometimes I do, and…

40:31.887 --> 40:34.390
Well, I went into the bedroom, and…

40:34.473 --> 40:37.268
-And he'd been there.
-(sobbing): Yes.

40:37.351 --> 40:41.313
(sobbing): He'd opened up
all my drawers and my closets

40:41.397 --> 40:42.982
and taken everything out.

40:44.316 --> 40:48.487
He pulled the bedspread off,
and he-- he took my underwear…

40:48.571 --> 40:50.322
Okay, okay. I get the picture.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.867
-Did you touch any of it?
-No.

40:52.950 --> 40:56.036
No, I was once married to a cop.
I know what to do.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.121
(sobs)

40:57.204 --> 40:58.831
Good girl.

40:58.914 --> 41:01.500
All right. You and Frank Jr.
are coming home with me tonight.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.461
-But what about…?
-No buts.

41:04.628 --> 41:08.549
I'm sending you over to your mother's
with Hingle and Perez to pick up Frank Jr.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.385
Then they'll take you to my place
and stay with you till I get back.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.637
Hold on. Ray!

41:15.347 --> 41:17.641
Get me Swanson. Oh, and Ecker at Midtown.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.019
I want to talk to them both
right now on the same line.

41:20.102 --> 41:20.936
All right.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.566
This guy, this crazy, this jerk is
as good as got, Fay, I swear to you.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.611
Frank, I'm sorry about
what I said this morning.

41:28.694 --> 41:31.363
I didn't mean it, about your not caring.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.448
Forget it.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.991
(phone ringing)

41:34.074 --> 41:35.242
You were scared.

41:39.914 --> 41:42.166
Frank, Swanson.
Ecker is not in his office.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.292
Keep trying.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.212
(phone ringing)

41:51.592 --> 41:52.885
(exhales)

41:55.471 --> 41:57.556
-How's that, Fay?
-(exhales)

41:58.516 --> 42:00.476
Good. Thanks, Phil.

42:02.269 --> 42:04.396
So, how are things?

42:05.397 --> 42:09.944
Hmm, given the ebbs and flows of life,
not too, too bad.

42:10.027 --> 42:14.156
Not great, but certainly not bad. (sniffs)

42:14.240 --> 42:15.449
Well, you sound low.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.245
Well, Fay, two women,

42:19.328 --> 42:21.080
two sets of emotions.

42:22.414 --> 42:26.377
Two sets of wants, needs, desires.

42:26.919 --> 42:27.753
(sighs)

42:27.836 --> 42:31.382
Two very different techniques.

42:32.174 --> 42:34.510
I mean, lying around stark naked

42:34.593 --> 42:39.348
with hundreds of other naked people
of both sexes…

42:40.140 --> 42:45.062
(tearfully): Phil,
I've had a very bad couple of days.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.816
Oh, Fay, did I say something?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.277
-Oh, Fay.
-(sobbing)

42:51.360 --> 42:52.695
Oh…

42:52.778 --> 42:55.656
Sex, sex, sex… I'm sexed to the teeth!

42:56.865 --> 42:59.410
-Oh. Oh.
-(sobbing continues)

43:00.869 --> 43:02.538
(indistinct station chatter)

43:14.550 --> 43:17.094
Ray, tell Frank I want to see him.
You, too.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.810
Out of respect for you, Emil, we waited,

43:25.477 --> 43:28.188
but since you didn't pull a warrant
on that apartment, we did.

43:29.523 --> 43:31.317
It was either that

43:31.400 --> 43:34.278
or have McAurley subpoenaed
by the public defender's office.

43:34.361 --> 43:36.655
His being subpoenaed isn't my problem.

43:36.739 --> 43:40.743
This is. This is low, Frank, real low.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.077
Tell him, Ray.

43:42.620 --> 43:46.915
The apartment house superintendent
verifies McAurley pays the rent.

43:47.458 --> 43:51.170
A search of the premises discovered
McAurley's phone numbers in her book

43:51.253 --> 43:54.798
and snapshots of the two of them together.

43:55.424 --> 43:58.510
We also got department store receipts
for women's clothes

43:58.594 --> 44:00.554
charged to McAurley's account.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.805
And…

44:03.182 --> 44:05.476
we turned up an acquaintance of the victim

44:05.559 --> 44:09.438
who says that Rosario Rivas
was McAurley's special lady.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.149
What's going on, Emil?

44:15.235 --> 44:16.695
No squeeze, Frank.

44:17.488 --> 44:20.157
It took us till today to verify all this.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.284
You knew about it days ago.

44:22.368 --> 44:23.535
(hushed): Listen, Frank.

44:24.370 --> 44:25.913
That kid killed that girl.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.291
Whatever else she was involved with
is immaterial.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.710
He did it, and we got him and that's it.

44:31.794 --> 44:32.920
"And that's it."

44:33.837 --> 44:36.799
Which adds up to murder one
for the Rodriguez kid.

44:36.882 --> 44:38.550
That's not my problem, Frank.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.135
And it shouldn't be yours, either.

44:41.303 --> 44:43.555
Let the lady plead him
whatever way she wants to.

44:44.306 --> 44:46.183
-Come on. I've seen her work.
-(buzzing)

44:46.266 --> 44:49.395
She'll put on a dog and pony show
for the D.A. that you wouldn't believe.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.939
-Furillo's office.
-She'll beg him down to manslaughter.

44:52.022 --> 44:54.942
He'll walk out after three.
I bet a thousand bucks on it here and now.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.068
Yeah?

44:57.111 --> 44:59.738
Then why won't McAurley talk to me, Emil?

45:00.197 --> 45:01.740
What's he hiding from?

45:01.824 --> 45:04.410
Frank, Davenport.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.120
She says it's urgent.

45:12.084 --> 45:13.252
Furillo.

45:13.335 --> 45:17.381
McAurley's on Channel 6 right now,
and you won't believe it.

45:17.464 --> 45:18.674
Sure. Right away.

45:19.466 --> 45:20.634
Turn on Channel 6.

45:29.977 --> 45:31.770
WOMAN (on TV):
<i>Talk a little, if you would,</i>

45:31.854 --> 45:34.773
<i>about the nature of this relationship,</i>
<i>Councilman.</i>

45:34.857 --> 45:37.985
<i>How, for example, you and Mrs. McAurley</i>
<i>came to know her.</i>

45:39.236 --> 45:43.824
<i>During the last campaign, uh,</i>
<i>Eve got to know Rose quite well.</i>

45:43.907 --> 45:46.869
<i>Eve had, uh, volunteered her time</i>

45:46.952 --> 45:49.663
<i>to help us establish</i>
<i>a youth center down here</i>

45:49.747 --> 45:53.333
<i>as an alternative</i>
<i>to the life of crime and violence</i>

45:53.417 --> 45:55.627
<i>that awaits so many of these youngsters.</i>

45:56.378 --> 46:00.799
<i>Eve recognized a rare intelligence</i>
<i>and sensitivity in the girl,</i>

46:01.842 --> 46:06.180
<i>and she prevailed upon me</i>
<i>to help improve the quality of her life.</i>

46:07.514 --> 46:10.142
EVE (on TV): <i>We became very close--</i>
<i>Rose and myself.</i>

46:10.225 --> 46:12.519
MCAURLEY: <i>Eve and I felt, and still do,</i>

46:13.604 --> 46:16.565
<i>that it's one thing to talk a good game.</i>

46:17.691 --> 46:19.818
<i>We decided to take an active part.</i>

46:19.902 --> 46:21.028
<i>So, you see,</i>

46:21.904 --> 46:24.615
<i>Rose was really like family to us.</i>

46:25.824 --> 46:28.744
<i>And it's the cruelest of ironies</i>

46:28.827 --> 46:30.579
<i>for this wonderful young woman</i>

46:31.830 --> 46:32.998
<i>to have left us.</i>

46:34.208 --> 46:36.627
<i>Can you tell us anything</i>
<i>about the circumstances</i>

46:36.710 --> 46:38.462
<i>surrounding this case, Councilman?</i>

46:38.545 --> 46:42.591
<i>Well, all I feel at liberty to say</i>

46:42.674 --> 46:46.720
<i>without, uh, damaging</i>
<i>the district attorney's investigation</i>

46:46.804 --> 46:50.682
<i>is that… there is a suspect</i>

46:50.766 --> 46:52.559
<i>in custody at this time.</i>

46:53.435 --> 46:56.563
<i>A young man who, uh, knew Rose before.</i>

46:57.397 --> 47:00.776
<i>Thank you, Councilman</i>
<i>and Mrs. Thomas McAurley.</i>

47:00.859 --> 47:02.402
<i>My deepest condolences.</i>

47:06.865 --> 47:08.367
Satisfied, Frank?

47:10.577 --> 47:12.037
That's all right.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.789
You meant well, but you didn't know.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.916
Enjoy the promotion.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.460
Let's have lunch together sometime, Ray.

47:20.003 --> 47:22.130
I appreciate that very much, Emil.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.216
(door closes)

47:29.847 --> 47:32.808
Francis,
we can't get the furnace to turn off,

47:32.891 --> 47:34.393
and I can't raise Maintenance.

47:34.476 --> 47:36.019
Talk about bankers' hours.

47:36.103 --> 47:38.856
Did you know they close down at 4:00?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.108
Call a furnace company.

47:41.900 --> 47:44.236
Put 'em on the books as an informant.

47:44.319 --> 47:46.780
Oh, that's a very creative idea.

47:47.531 --> 47:51.743
You know, since the word's out
that you might move up to Division,

47:51.827 --> 47:54.329
I have a few requests for transfer.

47:56.039 --> 47:57.332
How many?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.669
Twenty-eight uniforms,
seventeen plainclothes

48:00.752 --> 48:02.379
and one possible retirement.

48:03.338 --> 48:05.966
But you shouldn't in any way
let this affect your decision.

48:07.926 --> 48:09.678
I'll look at 'em in the morning.

48:11.054 --> 48:13.557
-Good night, Phil.
-Good night, Francis.

48:16.393 --> 48:19.354
(theme music playing)
