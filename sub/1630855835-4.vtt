Good news, peter.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.869
We finally saved enough money

00:36.912 --> 00:38.912
To go on a couple's
vacation together.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.873
We haven't traveled in years.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.208
That's not true.
You made us drive to toronto

00:43.294 --> 00:45.669
To confront that sex worker
I facetime with.

00:45.755 --> 00:48.088
Yeah, that wasn't a vacation,
that was an ultimatum.

00:48.215 --> 00:52.176
And after an insultingly
long pause, I chose you.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.636
We're going on a trip, peter.

00:55.639 --> 00:56.764
Aw, sweet.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.892
<i> Harold goldfarb:</i>
<i> Jetpack lawyer</i> is on.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.352
<i> Your honor,</i>
<i> may I approach the bench?</i>

01:02.480 --> 01:04.354
Is this so you can use
your jet pack?

01:04.482 --> 01:05.647
Yes.

01:05.816 --> 01:06.899
I'll allow it.

01:13.532 --> 01:14.782
I wish I had a jet pack.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.533
My life would be better.

01:16.619 --> 01:17.951
(electronic chirping)

01:18.079 --> 01:20.120
Ooh, 360.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.499
Oh, wait. 180.
Very good.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.875
Now let's get your height.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.795
All right.
So you're seven foot, six, 180,

01:27.922 --> 01:29.588
With colorectal cancer.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.340
I'm tall?

01:34.136 --> 01:37.221
Excuse me, I'm here
to renew my passport.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.599
Of course, let's go take
a terrible photo.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.602
Oh, my god, that's why
she wore the nice shirt.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.980
Oh, this is so sad.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.902
(gasps) oh, no!
Seal and heidi klum broke up.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.363
Uh, yeah, in 2012.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.865
All those magazines
are super old.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.200
(gasps) good lord.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.786
Whitney houston died?
Since when?

02:00.830 --> 02:02.913
Again, 2012.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.998
This says she drowned
in the bathtub.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.209
But-but I take baths.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.586
I think there may have been
other stuff going on.

02:09.672 --> 02:11.505
No! Baths kill, chris.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.049
And I will not become
another statistic.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.385
Next time I bathe,
I'm taking a shower.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.929
And it's gonna be
the best baby shower ever.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.639
I'll wear a tiara, go to brunch,

02:20.808 --> 02:22.307
And my best friend
will start crying,

02:22.434 --> 02:24.643
And that's when we realize
she's been trying for years.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.478
And I'll say,
"it's not your fault,"

02:26.564 --> 02:29.022
But quietly I wonder if it's
a result of her life choices.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.191
I mean, I'm as liberal as
anyone, but do you really think

02:31.318 --> 02:33.777
A throuple based on
a mutual love of cocaine

02:33.863 --> 02:35.028
Doesn't have consequences?

02:35.156 --> 02:37.614
I am as liberal
as anyone, though.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.997
Are you sure
you want to do this, peter?

02:45.124 --> 02:46.456
Seems a little reckless.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.208
You do know that
wearing a jet pack doesn't

02:48.294 --> 02:50.794
-Make you a lawyer, right?
-Objection.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.254
Not supporting my dream
of becoming

02:52.381 --> 02:54.381
-A sky attorney.
-Withdrawn.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.717
Hey, I saw a thing
and now I want to do the thing.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.427
That's my thing.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.263
Now, quit yapping and tape
these leaf blowers to my back.

Man, lois was pissed
about me wrecking the house.

03:56.362 --> 03:59.363
Really? I assumed she'd be numb
to your shenanigans by now.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.531
Worst part is I spent
all our vacation money

04:01.700 --> 04:03.200
On the jet pack without asking.

But I think I can help.

Why don't you use
my mom's condo in florida?

04:17.341 --> 04:19.091
Every year she winters
in buffalo.

But she doesn't listen.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.805
Thanks, joe.
Florida sounds great.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.139
I bet lois'll love that.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.144
All the seasons, really.

Brian, I need your help
to take a shower.

04:37.319 --> 04:40.445
Shower?! No way.
Dogs and showers don't mix.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.156
Come on, bri, you're the only
one who can do this with me.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.159
I can't go back there.
I'm sorry, it's just...

04:46.245 --> 04:49.246
I took a shower once.
I was so young.

<i> They stripped me down</i>
<i> like an animal.</i>

<i> The water just kept coming.</i>

05:09.601 --> 05:11.893
<i>I tried to fight back, but I was</i>
<i> half-blind from the soap.</i>

05:11.979 --> 05:14.438
<i> At first, peter tried</i>
<i> to bathe me from the side,</i>

05:14.523 --> 05:17.232
<i> But then he realized</i>

05:20.446 --> 05:21.653

05:32.624 --> 05:34.624
Thank you for your shower.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.044
Don't do this, stewie.

Once you get in that shower,
you never come back.

Sorry, but I'm taking
a shower...

05:42.801 --> 05:44.634
Uh, we-we can't afford
that u2 song.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.927
Oh, really?

05:46.096 --> 05:48.680
But they will pay us
to play one off their new album.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.183
Yeah, that's a big bon-no.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.528
Well, peter, I was skeptical,
but I got to say,

06:03.655 --> 06:04.988
It's beautiful here.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.656
Well, this is the address.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.716
Peter, this isn't
a vacation home,

06:24.802 --> 06:26.760
This is a retirement community.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.428
I can't believe
you never told me.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.639
Lois, we had
a whole conversation about this

06:30.766 --> 06:33.350
When you were passed out
on your airplane pills.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.477
Okay, I got to fess up,

06:35.562 --> 06:37.646
It's kind of
a retirement community.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.982
If you're okay with it,
breathe once every minute.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.529
-(snores)
-ah, there it is.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.916
I can't believe you took me
to a retirement community.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.084
Come on, it's not so bad.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.169
There's canasta and pickleball,

07:01.296 --> 07:04.005
Plus the world's softest
toilet seats.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.635

-uhp, here we go.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.682

that mother's day gift

07:27.448 --> 07:28.530

07:28.615 --> 07:29.739
It's a "joe-mometer."

07:29.867 --> 07:32.868
It announces celebrity trivia
in joe's voice.

<i> Joe:</i>
<i> It's 76 degrees.</i>

Wow.
That's mildly interesting.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.252
This place is depressing.
I want to go home.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.005
Oh, hey, I know this isn't
the trip you were hoping for,

07:45.090 --> 07:46.339
But our flight back
isn't for a week,

07:46.467 --> 07:48.258
So we may as well
try to have fun.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.635
Ugh, fine.
I'll give it a shot.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.095
You won't be disappointed.

07:52.181 --> 07:53.722
Remember, you didn't think
you'd like it

giant traps either.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.727

-Well, then tap out.

Who knows
the price of milk in 1942?

08:54.368 --> 08:56.284
(weak chuckle)
can't say that I have.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.410
It was a nickel.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.120
That was the price
of everything then.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.122
A suit was a nickel.
A house was a nickel.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.958
A dime was a nickel.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.545
Hemorrhoid donut for the lady?

09:09.174 --> 09:11.299
A girl could get used to this.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.386
Now, who wants to see me bite
into an apple with my own teeth?

09:14.546 --> 09:15.762
It's suicide!

turn on the tv, dear?

to work the remote myself,

I got folded inside a bed.

cigar box full of dominoes?

09:49.172 --> 09:50.755
My grandchildren are coming

09:50.841 --> 09:53.883

to do something fun.

Oh, such a strong boy.

Here, have a chick-o-stick.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.474
You carry candy in your pocket?

10:01.602 --> 10:02.851
Of course.

All right,
before the big shower,

10:28.712 --> 10:29.711
I should do a dry run.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.005
Need to get a feel
for the space.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.258
Let's start with
some articulation exercises.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.177
Soap the shins.
Soap the shins.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.471
Soap and sop
and soak the shins.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.973
The room sound is a little
tinny, but I can make it work.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.975
All right,
not bad for the first day.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.769
Rupert, toss over
the rope ladder.

10:45.896 --> 10:46.936
Rupert?

10:47.064 --> 10:50.023
Oh, you son of a bitch,
I knew it.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.608
Is this because
I suggested a prenup?

10:51.735 --> 10:54.694
Well, if money doesn't matter,
you should just sign it.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.699
(grunts)

11:01.870 --> 11:02.869
I'm stuck!

11:02.954 --> 11:04.454
Help!

11:07.918 --> 11:09.834
(panting)

11:09.920 --> 11:11.294
Oh, this is just great.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.547
I'm going to die in here
and I'll never take a shower.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.550
Maybe you won't, but we will.

11:17.636 --> 11:18.551
Really?

11:18.637 --> 11:20.387
Thanks, bri.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.015
The poop was in there
when I got in.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.397
Man, this place is great
for my self-esteem.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.399
I'm getting bicep squeezes
left and right.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.527
And men keep telling me
I look like greer garson.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.028
That's good, I think.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.780
Being the youngest,
healthiest people here

11:38.907 --> 11:40.115
Sure has its perks.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.159
It's like everyone
wants a piece of us.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.875
Before we harvest the organs
of these two young meatbags,

11:50.961 --> 11:53.128
We need to decide who gets what.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.297
So, if you want a body part,
call dibs now.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.509
Yeah, I'll take
the udders and the hooves.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.636
What? That's not a cow.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.346
That's a guy?

12:03.432 --> 12:05.390
But I saw him
eating grass earlier.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.017
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're
donating the brain to science.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.561
No one take the brain.

12:18.905 --> 12:19.988
Morning, peter.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.115
I brought you some
calcium-rich milk.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.326
It'll make your bones strong
so I can swim again.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.537
-Thanks, art.
-Don't thank me--

12:27.664 --> 12:29.330
The cow did most of the work.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.124
(both laughing)

12:33.170 --> 12:35.712
Lois, would you be a dear

12:35.797 --> 12:37.464
And lift this fruitcake

12:37.591 --> 12:39.883
That's the same weight
as my grandson?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.593
Um, sure?

12:42.846 --> 12:45.972
Full range of motion.
Firm grip.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.600
Time for your breakfast
eye exam.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.143
Which line can you read?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.187
Uh, well, I can read "gledjeb".

12:52.314 --> 12:55.732
That's not a word, it's just
random letters in a row.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.692
Really?
I thought it was dutch.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.235
Hey!
They said my name.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.229
Don't be so self-centered.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.365
They could mean
gledjeb opeldark.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.163
Well, you ready, stewie?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.874
Yup. Even got some decals
for the shower floor.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.709
I see you went with
the flower design.

13:14.795 --> 13:15.960
The daffodil pattern provides

13:16.046 --> 13:17.578
Superior protection
against slippage.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.256
Dr. Scholl's gave it
four toes out of seven.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.842
I-it's a weird scale,
but that's still pretty good.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.511
And I got us some shampoo.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.055
Why did you buy the kind
for color-treated hair?

13:27.182 --> 13:29.974
Speaking of<i> hair,</i> that is one
heck of a musical, huh?

13:30.060 --> 13:32.018
That's the hair
we should be discussing.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.270
You got a little
giuliani drip going there.

13:35.524 --> 13:38.358
There were voting
irregularities in michigan!

13:42.572 --> 13:45.698
Can you believe they gave us
complimentary massages?

13:46.701 --> 13:47.992
Welcome!

13:48.078 --> 13:50.328
Have you fasted
for the last 12 hours?

13:50.455 --> 13:52.580
-Were we supposed to?
-No worries.

13:52.707 --> 13:55.124
Why do you need our blood
pressure for a massage?

13:55.210 --> 13:57.627
Deep tissue. Hot stone.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.295
We have all different kinds.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.672
You just ignored my question

14:00.799 --> 14:02.674
And answered a different one
you had in your head.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.718
I did eat my twin in the womb,
thanks for asking.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.596
Okay, let's get you started.

14:10.842 --> 14:13.518
Are you a d cup
or is that just gravity?

14:13.603 --> 14:15.228
Oh, just gravity.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.105
Just a half rack, tony.

14:18.233 --> 14:22.026
Excuse me,
I have to use the restroom.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.700
Oh, my god.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.160
(playing "tie a yellow ribbon
round the ole oak tree")

14:35.125 --> 14:37.667
Ah.
Well, that's not so bad.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.713
Hard to misinterpret that.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.181
(gasps) oh, my god!

14:53.727 --> 14:56.686
And how many drinks would
you say you consume each week?

14:56.771 --> 14:58.521
Socially, about four to six.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.774
Alone in the dark while crying
to adele, a hundred.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.277
Welp, beggars can't be choosers.

15:08.742 --> 15:09.657
(grunts)

15:09.826 --> 15:11.910
They're trying to
steal our organs.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.203
They want to kill us.
Let's go.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.123
-What's happening?
-Don't worry, lois.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.541
It's called "flintstone legs."

15:18.585 --> 15:20.627
Trust me, all we need
is some traction.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.546
Calling all coots!

15:23.632 --> 15:27.091
Red dawn and the waddler
have flown the coop.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.391
Brian, if something should
happen to one or both of us,

15:35.477 --> 15:38.186
I'd regret not having said this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.188
You have a nice penis.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.523
I see it a lot,
I don't say anything,

15:42.609 --> 15:44.025
But it's nice.

15:44.069 --> 15:47.236
Now, you say something nice
about my penis.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.656
I think we should
turn the water on.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.038
(grunts)

15:59.292 --> 16:01.709
Huh, this isn't as bad
as I remember.

16:01.795 --> 16:02.835
It's actually kind of nice.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.088
I wonder what this thing does.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.715
(rattling)

16:07.801 --> 16:10.093
-Aah!
-Aah!

16:10.178 --> 16:12.261
-This is horrible!
-The spray is too strong.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.472
We have to turn down the water.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.229
Now it's too hot!
Now it's too cold!

16:21.314 --> 16:24.565
My god, how does chris
stay in here for 45 minutes?

16:24.693 --> 16:26.985
He's doing other stuff,
but we got to get out of here.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.321
Oh, my god,
now the tub is filling up.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.740
Wait a minute,
the tub is filling up.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.867
This isn't a shower anymore.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.453
This is a bath!
I know baths.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.955
I've got this, bri.

Ew, that's gross.

No, it isn't.
It's our lifeline, brian.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.995
Boost me to the shower caddy.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.706
-Oh!
-(grunts)

17:24.961 --> 17:26.669
Hang on.

(grunting)

17:33.636 --> 17:35.470
Aah! (grunts)

17:36.473 --> 17:39.390
We are never
taking a shower again.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.683
Agreed.

17:40.810 --> 17:44.270
Uh, fellas, I'm gonna need
the room for 45 minutes.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.205
-(tires screeching)
-(grunts)

18:02.332 --> 18:04.916
I'm gonna gut you like a fish

18:05.043 --> 18:07.877
And scoop out your insides.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.379
Right after I parallel park.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.965
Peter, come on!

18:13.134 --> 18:14.383
Sorry, lois.
As a man,

18:14.511 --> 18:17.220
I'm required to watch
other men parallel park.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.098
Peter, he wants to kill us!
Let's go!

18:25.105 --> 18:26.145
You got to cut the wheel.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.856
I am cutting the wheel.

18:30.151 --> 18:33.653
-No, the other way.
-This is the other way, jerk.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.197
No, left. Cut left.

18:36.324 --> 18:39.492
Pull back, cut left.
Now I'm involved.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.285
Right.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.287
Oh!
They shrunk the spaces

18:43.414 --> 18:46.415
So they could make more money.
(weak chuckle)

18:46.543 --> 18:49.001
Sir, this is a standard space
on a public street.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.045
Nobody's making money here.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.011
Stop where you are.

18:59.097 --> 19:03.266
We would like this all
to be over by 4:00 p.M., please.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.229
(growling)

19:09.816 --> 19:10.898
Enough!

19:10.984 --> 19:12.900
You freaks are never
getting our organs!

19:12.986 --> 19:15.736
Now shuffle aside
before I call the cops.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.155
This is florida, doll.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.866
The cops are all just strippers
who carry guns.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.701
-Then who are the strippers?
-Firemen.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.870
-So, who fights the fires?
-No idea.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.582
-You're sick.
-And you-- you're selfish.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.918
You come in here flaunting
your working ears and knuckles

19:31.087 --> 19:32.295
That don't look like an abacus

19:32.380 --> 19:35.131
And expect us
not to pick you clean

19:35.216 --> 19:37.675
Like the last hour
at a chinese buffet?

19:37.760 --> 19:43.389
If we have to take your organs
by force, then so be it.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.558
-Have it your way.
-(knuckles crack)

19:45.685 --> 19:47.101
We always do,

19:47.187 --> 19:49.979
No matter how many times
we have to send the entrée back.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.231
We will stand here
and fight until--

19:52.400 --> 19:55.026
-Woman: It's 4:04.
-Oh! We're missing dinner!

19:55.153 --> 19:57.361
(indistinct chatter)

19:59.073 --> 20:00.323
I'm sorry, lois.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.491
Looks like I ruined
another vacation.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.994
You know, peter, I was upset
when you brought me here

20:05.121 --> 20:07.538
Because I wanted to have
an exciting vacation,

20:07.624 --> 20:08.873
Just the two of us,

20:08.958 --> 20:11.000
And I thought this place
was gonna be boring,

20:11.127 --> 20:13.002
But you know what?
Turns out

20:13.087 --> 20:15.171
Fleeing from bloodthirsty
senior citizens with you

20:15.256 --> 20:17.048
Was kind of a thrill.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.258
This may not have been
the vacation I expected

20:19.385 --> 20:22.428
But it turned out to be
the best one I've ever had.

20:22.513 --> 20:23.930
I love you, peter.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.556
I love you, too.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.185
Man, this place is crazy.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.896
Can you believe joe
was in the dark about all this?

20:31.940 --> 20:33.981
Did you get the legs?

20:34.108 --> 20:37.276
Damn it!
(inhales, exhales)

20:37.362 --> 20:38.778
No, no, no, it's fine.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.489
I'll see if I can get cleveland
to go down there next week.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.502
Hey, bud! How was florida?
