00:25.391 --> 00:27.670
Do you wonder what happens?

00:35.301 --> 00:37.145
Not really.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.398
That's a long ways from now.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.622
What would I be afraid of?

00:48.781 --> 00:50.359
And?

00:51.584 --> 00:53.428
And what?

00:55.215 --> 00:56.934
What do you think happens?

00:59.626 --> 01:01.482
I don't know.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.573
Something better than this.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.976
An afterlife.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.715
Yeah.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.986
What?

01:21.981 --> 01:24.227
I've never been to church.

01:32.058 --> 01:34.270
Well, what do you think happens?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.445
What if nothing else happens?

01:48.541 --> 01:51.153
What if it all just goes away?

01:54.764 --> 01:56.608
Every touch.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.850
Every kiss. Every argument and apology.

02:06.492 --> 02:09.471
What if none of it exists when...

02:12.131 --> 02:15.083
...when there's nobody left to remember it?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.952
Nobody knows.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.889
It's something much bigger than us.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.241
Okay.

07:55.891 --> 07:57.445
Shit.

09:15.855 --> 09:18.277
And your path became clear.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.320
I just wish you could understand
what I'm trying to do for you.

12:26.378 --> 12:29.970
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm sorry.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.636
Sorry.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.404
Sorry.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.874
You will.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.778
You will.

13:08.320 --> 13:12.343
But your obedience is not optional.

13:44.069 --> 13:46.179
Thine is the kingdom.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.682
And the power and glory of yours.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.249
Now and forever.

13:57.002 --> 14:01.841
Fear not, that which can harm
the body but cannot kill the soul.

14:02.842 --> 14:07.899
Rather fear that which is able
to kill both the body and soul...

14:08.547 --> 14:10.121
...in hell.

14:26.598 --> 14:28.152
Why?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.322
Why are you doing this?

14:40.896 --> 14:42.717
I had a brother.

14:43.188 --> 14:45.825
Guess I wasn't particularly fond of him.

14:47.653 --> 14:51.678
One day we were hiking
in the bluffs above the ocean...

14:51.758 --> 14:54.948
...and at the highest point
he paused to look out.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.484
No one was there to see it.

14:57.764 --> 15:02.453
To see me... shove him over the edge.

15:04.019 --> 15:06.249
You know what that felt like?

15:07.639 --> 15:09.193
Nothing.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.033
I killed my brother...

15:13.113 --> 15:15.484
...and it felt so...

15:15.564 --> 15:17.168
...right.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.089
And that terrified me.

15:22.504 --> 15:27.324
I needed to know why God would make
something like that feel so natural.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.216
I don't understand.

15:31.964 --> 15:36.723
In the old testament,
there's a general by the name of Jehoram.

15:36.803 --> 15:41.155
He set out with an army to completely
exterminate the Moab people...

15:41.235 --> 15:44.964
...living in the desert. In his haste
he didn't bring enough water...

15:45.044 --> 15:50.207
...so Jehoram, hellbent on
the mass murder of his enemies...

15:50.287 --> 15:52.572
...turns to the Lord...

15:52.952 --> 15:55.178
...who surprisingly responds.

15:56.488 --> 15:59.613
He tells him and his army to dig.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.873
Fill the valley with holes and ditches.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.798
Offer a sacrifice...

16:05.878 --> 16:09.521
...and God will fill these ditches
with what they needed.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.159
Because the truth was...

16:13.239 --> 16:16.460
...God has a need for them.

16:18.110 --> 16:23.047
- You told him you'd let me go.
- I told him you would be saved!

16:23.415 --> 16:25.625
Just as he was saved.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.106
Just as God saves.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.964
He gave you his gifts for a reason,
and that reason was not sin.

16:34.044 --> 16:36.364
We didn't do anything wro...

16:44.708 --> 16:46.560
I killed my brother.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.461
It was sin, I accept that.

16:52.694 --> 16:55.751
I used God's gifts for selfish reasons.

16:56.982 --> 17:00.807
And now, I teach the lessons that most men...

17:00.887 --> 17:02.985
...they don't have the stomach for.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.114
You can't change who you are.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.553
You can only change what you do with it.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.409
It's time for your confession.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.625
No! Please!

19:02.274 --> 19:03.908
Wait.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.135
I'll confess.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.802
I'll do anything, just tell me what it is.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.808
It's simple.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.445
You tell me your sins.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.793
How you abused the gifts he gave you...

19:26.365 --> 19:28.602
...and then you pay your penance.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.248
Please.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.595
Don't hurt me.

20:11.803 --> 20:13.397
Please.

20:16.581 --> 20:18.677
I'll do anything for you.

20:24.522 --> 20:26.276
For God.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.591
Please.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.104
Please.

21:01.576 --> 21:03.397
Thank you.

21:15.070 --> 21:18.332
For showing me what a whore you've become.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.699
What do you want from me?

21:23.098 --> 21:24.618
No!

21:54.680 --> 21:56.533
I'm sorry.

21:57.449 --> 21:59.236
I'm so sorry.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.438
So sorry.

22:30.148 --> 22:34.951
After all he did just to give you
a few more minutes of life.

22:46.932 --> 22:49.153
He understood his faults.

22:50.201 --> 22:52.556
He felt remorse...

22:53.905 --> 22:57.728
...for the twisted life that he was leading.

23:04.816 --> 23:07.872
Clearly, it was you.

23:09.087 --> 23:11.142
Feeding him the apple.

23:11.823 --> 23:14.679
You were the temptation all along.

23:32.678 --> 23:35.517
Fill this valley with ditches...

23:35.715 --> 23:40.704
...and so his tired
and thirsty men began to dig...

23:40.785 --> 23:45.329
...and toiled and struggled
until they could do no more.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.080
They had done their part.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.727
The next morning...

23:53.272 --> 23:56.534
...they offered a living sacrifice.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.225
Help me.

23:59.305 --> 24:02.195
And there was no rain or clouds or thunder...

24:02.275 --> 24:05.264
...but the lord filled those ditches

24:05.344 --> 24:07.633
...with the water that they needed...

24:07.713 --> 24:11.137
...and that same day
they purged the Moab people...

24:11.217 --> 24:13.638
...in a violent sea of blood...

24:14.185 --> 24:16.275
...and used violence...

24:16.755 --> 24:18.843
...for a higher purpose.

24:19.491 --> 24:23.019
- God's purpose.
- I don't know what I did wrong.

24:24.930 --> 24:29.055
Please, I don't know what I did!
Please, please don't do this!

24:29.135 --> 24:31.387
Don't do this!

24:56.695 --> 24:58.582
You're just...

24:59.030 --> 25:00.884
...this poor...

25:01.399 --> 25:03.253
...lost girl.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.656
Come here.

25:09.441 --> 25:11.262
I understand.

25:13.044 --> 25:16.467
You just needed him to be stronger.

25:21.052 --> 25:23.707
But he used you...

25:24.155 --> 25:26.009
...for sin.

25:41.423 --> 25:43.444
Do I kill you now?

25:46.144 --> 25:48.012
Deliver you to evil?

25:49.247 --> 25:51.101
I think...

25:52.250 --> 25:55.808
- ...that you need a true burden to bear.
- Please, please!

25:55.888 --> 25:59.377
Please don't do this!
I don't know what I did!

26:00.625 --> 26:02.147
Please.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.682
I'm sorry, I'll do anything.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.325
Thank you. Thank you.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.221
And your struggle will bring you closer.

26:52.377 --> 26:55.450
You... have sinned.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.221
In your thoughts.

26:58.551 --> 27:00.437
In your actions.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.277
In what you've done
and what you've failed to do.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.113
Remember that.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.919
Pray for forgiveness.

27:14.382 --> 27:15.936
And...

27:17.736 --> 27:19.824
...pray for a quick end.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.894
Of your mortal binds.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.724
What are you doing?

27:34.019 --> 27:35.706
Stop!

28:04.716 --> 28:07.806
Jehoram's army filled his valley in a day.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.231
How long do you think it'll take one man...

28:15.561 --> 28:17.381
...to do the same?

29:16.855 --> 29:18.711
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

29:18.991 --> 29:20.999
<i>Why would I be nervous?</i>

29:21.927 --> 29:24.973
My family is going to love you.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.990
My father told me he loved me.

29:36.341 --> 29:38.195
He was wrong.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.771
You're going to your real family now.

29:46.151 --> 29:50.408
And you're gonna see
what life is supposed to be like.

29:55.143 --> 29:57.847
He's the only family I've known.

30:01.149 --> 30:02.905
You're better than him.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.989
I'm half of him.

30:06.604 --> 30:08.158
No.

30:08.539 --> 30:12.106
You're none of him. You're only you.

32:30.248 --> 32:31.802
Fuck!

33:43.054 --> 33:44.875
What the fuck now?

33:57.402 --> 33:59.678
Dammit, where are you, girl?

34:05.409 --> 34:07.063
Emilia!

34:09.246 --> 34:11.135
I'll find you!

34:31.018 --> 34:32.850
Where the fuck have you been?

34:44.581 --> 34:47.071
I told you to stay in the house.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.809
I could really use your help right now.

35:50.381 --> 35:52.202
It's so cold.

36:00.391 --> 36:03.047
How am I supposed to do this without you?

36:04.262 --> 36:06.950
I was the weak one, me.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.737
I'm so scared.

36:30.554 --> 36:32.442
Please help me.

36:39.497 --> 36:41.151
Michael?

36:47.839 --> 36:50.996
What is this? What is this?

36:51.076 --> 36:52.762
Michael!

37:00.318 --> 37:02.149
<i>We can go.</i>

37:06.924 --> 37:09.948
- <i>We can drive all the way...</i>
- Stop it. Stop it!

37:10.028 --> 37:11.814
Stop it!

37:13.030 --> 37:14.504
Stop it!

37:15.466 --> 37:18.757
Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up!

37:19.237 --> 37:23.593
<i>I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry...
I'm sorry I couldn't...</i>

37:23.707 --> 37:27.364
- Go away.
- <i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

37:29.914 --> 37:31.435
Please.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.888
Go away.

37:43.494 --> 37:45.348
Go away.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.253
<i>Sorry.</i>

37:54.171 --> 37:56.793
<i>I'm sorry, honey, I'm sorry.</i>

38:03.280 --> 38:05.437
Yes, I promise, I'm fine.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.539
- Bye.
- Emilia.

38:10.204 --> 38:13.222
Emilia, why are you being so quiet in there?

38:16.627 --> 38:19.316
Yes, I promise I'm coming in.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.251
I promise.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.391
<i>Please, I need to go.</i>

38:25.771 --> 38:27.357
<i>Hello?</i>

38:29.573 --> 38:31.594
<i>Who's there?</i>

38:37.248 --> 38:40.340
Who the fuck is talking on my phone?

38:43.387 --> 38:45.431
<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

38:48.726 --> 38:51.683
- <i>Answer me!</i>
- <i>It's Michael, sir.</i>

38:51.763 --> 38:54.192
<i>I was just talking with Emilia.</i>

38:55.966 --> 38:57.988
Who the fuck are you?

39:00.604 --> 39:02.458
Fuck you!

39:12.149 --> 39:15.428
I said... no phone calls.

39:18.522 --> 39:21.411
And no boys.

39:37.408 --> 39:39.129
I'm sorry!

40:42.906 --> 40:45.335
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.084
Go.

41:10.167 --> 41:12.001
Go away.

41:22.679 --> 41:26.137
Please! Please. Please.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.803
Please.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.101
Go away!

41:42.067 --> 41:44.287
I said go the fuck away!

41:51.375 --> 41:53.229
Go away!

41:54.211 --> 41:56.601
Go! Fuck you! Go!

41:56.681 --> 41:59.202
Fuck you! Fuck you!

41:59.383 --> 42:03.209
Go! Fuck you, go! Fuck you!

45:18.148 --> 45:21.780
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45:22.654 --> 45:27.009
I told you... your penance is to keep quiet!

45:29.189 --> 45:31.814
Okay. Okay.

45:32.696 --> 45:34.618
You know what?

45:34.698 --> 45:37.586
Look at me. Look at me!

45:39.570 --> 45:42.793
Let me explain this to you
in a way that you will understand.

45:45.449 --> 45:47.297
Do you see her?

45:49.746 --> 45:53.236
Do you see her?

45:56.019 --> 45:57.840
She's next.

45:59.056 --> 46:01.111
But she can be saved.

46:05.896 --> 46:08.117
If you keep quiet...

46:08.966 --> 46:11.089
...and pay your penance...

46:11.169 --> 46:15.190
...like a good true believer.

46:17.441 --> 46:19.416
Then she can be saved.

46:22.346 --> 46:24.036
But if not...

46:25.482 --> 46:28.473
...then I guess you two
will just have to trade places.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.556
And you will get to watch.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.702
That's better.

47:59.877 --> 48:03.767
<i>We can drive all the way to California.</i>

48:10.254 --> 48:12.965
<i>I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.</i>

48:13.045 --> 48:15.605
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- Stop it, stop it.

48:24.501 --> 48:26.573
I've gotta get out of here.

50:14.311 --> 50:15.865
Fuck.

51:40.504 --> 51:42.317
No good.

52:10.693 --> 52:13.716
God. Oh, my God.

56:27.033 --> 56:29.293
<i>How are you still such a good person?</i>

56:32.123 --> 56:34.009
I'm not.

56:36.443 --> 56:38.394
After everything.

56:39.262 --> 56:42.545
There's nothing bitter
or angry in those eyes.

56:44.701 --> 56:46.255
<i>How?</i>

56:52.659 --> 56:54.947
I am those things.

56:59.282 --> 57:01.170
<i>I'm all of it.</i>

57:05.588 --> 57:08.144
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey come here, no.

57:08.958 --> 57:10.813
Listen to me.

57:14.247 --> 57:15.851
How?

57:16.516 --> 57:18.404
You bury it.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.524
I bury it under something else.

57:22.806 --> 57:25.529
We can go, we can... we can...

57:25.609 --> 57:28.432
...we can get in my van and we can...

57:28.512 --> 57:32.205
...we can drive all the way to California.

57:35.151 --> 57:36.974
What was there...

57:37.054 --> 57:39.141
...to bury it with?

57:42.659 --> 57:44.213
<i>Hope.</i>

57:49.532 --> 57:51.420
And you.

59:04.554 --> 59:06.149
Shit.

59:08.279 --> 59:10.195
Can't hide now!

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.428
What?

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:01.670
Still hiding back here?

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:05.107
I know you like the quiet.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.199
Nurses wouldn't mind
their break room back though.

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.282
They can have it.

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:19.323
It's been a while, Emilia.

01:07:19.403 --> 01:07:23.422
You're looking better though.
Do you think you wanna talk about it?

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:29.172
Maybe we can start from the basics.

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:37.996
You know if you're thirsty
you can take a sip.

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:48.151
Go on, the basics.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:52.689
Okay, I know nothing about
what you went through was basic.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.856
The problem is...

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.894
...I don't know
what you exactly went through.

01:07:57.974 --> 01:08:00.959
I mean, we have your initial statement.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:07.320
He took us from the van, I survived,
Michael didn't... but that's it.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.507
Looking through your records we found
that Michael must be Michael Pherson,

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:13.786
...registered owner of the van
we found, also the owner...

01:08:13.866 --> 01:08:16.707
...of the blood we found on your body.

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:22.185
We can talk about something different.

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:28.915
I called your father up in Montana.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.725
Still no answer.

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:39.001
We can talk about that
later too if you'd like.

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.372
Look, all I wanna know is...

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.944
...you come back here held up everyday,

01:08:48.024 --> 01:08:50.113
...you don't speak to anyone...

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:53.982
...Emilia, do you even want our help?

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:06.354
I said I'd get my own
fucking water if I needed it.

01:09:11.145 --> 01:09:13.167
But they didn't listen.

01:09:14.533 --> 01:09:16.555
They always wanna help.

01:09:19.337 --> 01:09:22.028
They want to help because then they own you.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:29.082
<i>A man raises you after your mother dies...</i>

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:33.377
<i>...and suddenly you're his property,
no questions asked.</i>

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.939
<i>Boy saves you...</i>

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.395
<i>...you owe him your heart.</i>

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:44.982
<i>God saves you. You owe him your soul.</i>

01:09:49.805 --> 01:09:52.649
What if I don't wanna give those things up?

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:56.412
What if I take them back?

01:10:06.234 --> 01:10:08.089
Fuck this water.

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:15.029
I wanna help.

01:10:26.729 --> 01:10:28.543
I know.

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:32.180
It's who you are.

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.357
You can't change it.

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:23.965
Hey, honey?

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.253
Honey?

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.265
Oh, my God.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.038
Oh, my God, no. No.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:37.538
Honey, honey?

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.643
Who did this?

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.646
Who did this to you?

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.650
Who did this?

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:11.773
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hello?

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.175
Yes!

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:17.345
I need an ambulance.

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:21.115
Yes, my wife, she's been stabbed.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.752
She's been stabbed.

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:28.189
I don't know.

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.526
I don't know. I don't know who...

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:35.063
Please.

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:39.302
I don't know! Just... please!

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:41.202
Send somebody.

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:46.086
Yes. Yes, that's my address, please!

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:48.776
Please.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:55.236
Okay. Okay.

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.659
I'm so sorry.

01:14:58.426 --> 01:15:00.314
Look at her.

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:02.683
Look at her.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.654
She had no idea, did she?

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:13.261
Can't feel my arms.

01:15:15.694 --> 01:15:17.515
You won't.

01:15:18.006 --> 01:15:20.003
You won't feel anything anymore.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.437
Just like I don't.

01:15:24.703 --> 01:15:28.509
I spent so long trying to hide my rage.

01:15:29.842 --> 01:15:32.332
Then you taught me the truth.

01:15:35.263 --> 01:15:37.285
My rage is a gift.

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:42.236
And I won't waste it.
